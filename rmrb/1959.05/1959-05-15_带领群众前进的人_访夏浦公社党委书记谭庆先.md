    The Person Leading the Masses Forward
    —An Interview with Tan Qingxian, Secretary of the XiaPu Commune Party Committee
    By Our Reporter Zhou Rong

    The clear waters of the Xiangjiang River are inlaid with the golden light of the morning sun, so calm and beautiful. Red flags fluttered on the fields on both sides of the river. People were harvesting spring soybeans and rapeseed, rushing to transplant mid-season rice, and cultivating early rice, a lively scene. I took a boat from outside Hengshan County to XiaPu to visit Tan Qingxian, the Secretary of the XiaPu People's Commune Party Committee.

    Strength to Overcome Storms
    Chen Huihuang, the director of the commune party committee office, received me. He said, "Comrade Tan Qingxian came back today to study the work, and immediately went to the Ganxi Brigade again. He never warms the office stool; he spends his days barefoot in straw sandals, working, studying, and doing production labor with the masses. Hurry over there, you might be able to talk to him in person. I'll call ahead and make an appointment for you." With that, he shook the phone and shook my hand. I walked out of the office and rushed to the Ganxi Brigade, seven li away.

    I only met the secretary on duty, Luo Xiangzhen, at the brigade office, and still didn't find Tan Qingxian. Old Luo said that Tan Qingxian had gone to the Shiqiao Brigade, eight li away, to inspect production. It was getting dark, and I was unfamiliar with the area, so he asked me to rest there for a while. Presumably, Comrade Chen Huihuang had called Tan Qingxian, because soon after I sat down, he called the Ganxi Brigade and said he would come over and talk to me in the evening. However, minute after minute passed, and it was midnight, but Tan Qingxian had not returned, and I was getting anxious.

    Suddenly, a strong wind arose, and thick dark clouds obscured the stars in the sky. Accompanied by thunder and lightning, a torrential rain poured down, drumming on the roof tiles with a crash.

    I looked out the window, and many lights appeared and disappeared in the wind and rain in the fields. The commune members, wearing straw raincoats and hats, were preventing floods and protecting the newly transplanted early rice seedlings. I completely understood why Comrade Tan Qingxian hadn't returned.

    That afternoon, when he was inspecting production in the Shiqiao Brigade, he remembered the forecast that there would be a storm that night. This is a mountainous area, and in the past, when storms came, they would damage thousands of mu of rice paddies. This year, we must no longer let mountain floods wreak havoc! We must mobilize the strength of the masses to overcome it! So he immediately found the commune cadres and experienced old farmers to discuss solutions. At first, he asked everyone if there would be heavy rain that night. Everyone said:
    "It seems the weather has changed. Maybe there will be."
    "If we want to ensure a bumper harvest this year, what should we do if there's heavy rain and mountain floods?"
    Everyone said that flood prevention and drainage ditches had recently been dug at the foot of the mountains, leading directly to the Ganxi River. Tonight, we are determined to send people to guard along the ditches and further reinforce the ditch banks, and we will surely be able to overcome the mountain floods. Secretary Tan listened to everyone and admired the masses' strong sense of responsibility and their clever and effective methods. He agreed with everyone's opinion and decided to do it that way. After this team's cadres and commune members returned, they immediately took action. At this time, he convened a telephone conference for the entire commune, relaying the flood prevention measures of the Shiqiao Brigade to other production teams, and asking if other production teams could do the same. All teams said: If the Shiqiao team can do it, we can definitely do it too. So, the masses of the entire commune took action, deploying forces to guard along the drainage ditches of 13,000 mu of early rice fields; then, he called each team to check on their progress. After hearing that the flood prevention preparations had been completed in each team, he hurried from the Shiqiao Brigade to the Ganxi Brigade. It was already past ten o'clock at night.

    As soon as he entered the Mingzhengqiao Production Team of the Ganxi Brigade, as expected, a storm came. He forgot everything else and immediately joined the masses in the battle to prevent floods and protect seedlings. When the commune members heard that the Party Secretary had come, they worked even harder, shouting, "We will not rest until we defeat the storm!" Commune member Dai Kuiben jumped into the ditch, clothes and all, and quickly dug out the sand and stones washed down by the mountain flood. Commune member Chen Shengfang's lamp went out, and he used the lightning to walk from one field to another, checking the strength of the drainage ditches. More people were working together to drain the floodwaters. Tan Qingxian directed the battle in the dark. The wind blew away many people's hats, and the rain soaked them to the skin. But they stood firm in the storm, working even harder, and the battle continued until four o'clock the next morning. The storm finally passed, and the mountain flood flowed into the Mi River from the drainage ditches like a tamed wild horse. Each brigade immediately informed Secretary Tan of the results by telephone: not a single rice plant was damaged, and this battle strengthened people's confidence and courage to overcome disasters. The night passed, and the morning sun reappeared in the east with a smile.

    Field Testimony
    After breakfast, Comrade Tan Qingxian came to the brigade headquarters. He was wearing the same blue clothes as the commune members, carrying a large bamboo hat, and his pockets were filled with books, documents, and notebooks. He shook hands with me warmly and said, "I'm late, I'm sorry, there's not much to talk about, we haven't done enough, we need to work harder in all aspects." I said, "You've worked hard, rest for a while before we talk!" He immediately said that it didn't matter if he didn't sleep at night. He said that there would be an on-site meeting this afternoon, so now was the time to go to the fields and take a look. It might be better to talk while looking, and it would be more specific. So, we walked and talked.

    Being in the middle of the vast green early rice fields, I felt particularly cheerful and comfortable. The early rice, which had been transplanted for half a month, was growing green, tender, and strong. The rows of rice plants ran from north to south, row to row, plant to plant, neatly arranged, with planting densities of 3x5 inches and 3x6 inches. We walked past one field after another, and came to the experimental field of the women Xiao Lianying and others. The rice was growing just as well, and the planting density was exactly as required. Tan Qingxian said, "Today's women are not simple, they are doing everything up to standard." With that, he stuck his hand into the mud, and bubbles of fertilizer kept rolling up from the mud, turning the mud black. This is one of the fundamental reasons why the rice is growing so well. He said that in the entire commune's 13,000 mu of early rice, many fields were even better than this one, and only a few were worse. The commune members had great confidence in a bumper harvest this year.

    The people in this mountain valley are diligent, brave, and full of energy. When the Party Committee called for fertilizer accumulation, tens of thousands of men, women, old, and young went into action, accumulating fertilizer all over the mountains. However, according to their past habits, they did not ferment the fertilizer or make refined fertilizer after accumulating it, and they applied raw fertilizer to the fields when transplanting rice, so the fertilizer efficiency was not high. In order to change this crude fertilization method, the commune party committee called on everyone to ferment or make refined fertilizer, but after a while, no one was doing it. Tan Qingxian further investigated the reasons and found that the masses here really did not know how to ferment or dig ditches. He called the team cadres and commune members Rong Jui, Wu Xianglai, and others to try, but they didn't know how at all. This confirmed that the masses were not lazy or unwilling to dig ditches and ferment fertilizer. He immediately returned to his own experimental field, dug fermentation ditches, and put the fertilizer into the ditches to ferment. The fertilizer quickly began to decompose. At this time, he invited the cadres of each team and some old farmers to visit, explaining the principle that this made the fertilizer decompose and the fertilizer efficiency was high, and telling everyone how to dig ditches to ferment fertilizer, how to turn the ditches, etc. When the masses understood the principle, they also learned how to do it. Within five days of returning, each mu of land had 40 to 70 fermentation ditches dug, and all the fertilizer from the mountains was transported to the fields by trucks and aerial tramways. When the weather was clear, the ditches were generally turned two to three times. By the time of transplanting, the fertilizer not only averaged 1,040 dan per mu, but it had also decomposed and matured, emitting a foul odor like manure. The habit of applying crude fertilizer that had been in place for so long was completely changed to applying refined fertilizer, which was a big step forward and laid a solid foundation for this year's bumper harvest.

    Seeing that the time for transplanting early rice was not far away, the commune party committee began to consider the density of planting in the masses. After consultation and full discussion, it was decided to generally promote the 3x6 inch planting density. Soon, the Hengshan County Party Committee's production inspection team came here and found that the general deep plowing was more than eight inches to one foot, and the fertilizer was more than a thousand dan, and the quality was good. Based on last year's bumper harvest experience and the opinions of technical personnel, it was suitable to plant 3x5 inches here, which could increase rice production by 120 catties per mu compared to planting 3x6 inches. So the county party committee suggested that half of the land be planted with 3x6 inches and the other half be changed to 3x5 inches. Tan Qingxian immediately convened a meeting of the commune party committee to discuss it, and then convened a meeting of commune members, members of the Communist Youth League, work team leaders, and activists or above for discussion. He found that some people were worried that planting 3x5 inches would not be convenient for inter-tillage and topdressing, so he gave everyone a live demonstration, and everyone saw that he was able to cultivate and topdress in the field with a cultivator very freely. The worries were dispelled, and they happily returned to their respective teams. Similarly, mass meetings were convened in each team, explaining the principles and giving live demonstrations. When the masses understood that this year was different from the past, that the deep plowing had a lot of good quality fertilizer, and that planting 3x5 inches could increase production, and they also saw that they could still cultivate, topdress, and remove insects, they enthusiastically supported the county party committee's suggestion. At this time, Comrade Tan Qingxian joined the masses in a brigade to create an experimental field of 3x5 inches as a demonstration, and the masses supported it even more. Everyone immediately took action, changing some of the 3x6 inch transplanting frames to 3x5 inch frames and sending them to the brigade party branch for appraisal. Each group specifically planned the 3x5 inch and 3x6 inch transplanting specifications to the fields, and transplanted according to the specifications when transplanting. After inspection and acceptance, the specifications were accurate. Comrade Tan Qingxian's implementation of the Party's mass line was once again victorious.

    First Be a Student, Then Be a Teacher
    While the early rice was being transplanted, Old Tan considered the issue of field cultivation and management. Since the foundations of "deep, fertile, and dense" were well laid, high yields could be achieved as long as management was strengthened. How to do a good job of field management? The situation was different from last year, and new methods were needed.

    Old Tan was determined to first consult the commune cadres and old farmers. This day, he came to the home of Wu Gengui, the production team leader of Mingzhengqiao in the Ganxi Brigade, and stayed there. He was determined to first learn from Wu Gengui and the old farmer Chen Shengfang, and then quickly promote the method after studying it together. At the beginning, he explained his plans and solicited their opinions. Old Tan said that he was prepared to fully organize the labor force and carry out three or four intensive inter-tillage weedings and topdressings. After careful consideration, Wu Gengui, Chen Shengfang, and others said that this would not work and put forward new opinions: According to the new situation after deep plowing and dense planting and the new requirements for more increased production, four to five people (accounting for 20% of the total labor force) should be drawn from a work team to form a professional cultivation and management group to grasp the changes in the situation for cultivation and management; determine a part-time water watchman to manage irrigation and drainage; at the same time, there is a lot of fertilizer this year, so we must look at the fields and look at the seedlings to topdress, and not apply it uniformly; other commune members will cooperate in cultivation and management. This might be better. Comrade Tan Qingxian came with the purpose of learning, and when he saw that they were making sense, he gave up his original opinion and agreed with the opinions of Old Wu and Old Chen, and waited for further promotion after the experiment. So, he invited Xiao Lusheng, the party branch secretary of the Ganxi Brigade, to conduct a pilot project. After the Mingzhengqiao Production Team did this, the effect was very good, and the masses were all satisfied. Then, an on-site meeting of work team leaders of the Ganxi Brigade was held here to mobilize everyone to put forward more new methods. The work team leaders came to the early rice fields and saw that inter-tillage had removed the weeds, fertilizer had been applied according to the specific conditions of each field, and irrigation and drainage had been rationalized, so the seedlings were growing tender and green. At the same time, large earthenware jars were placed on each field ridge, filled with self-made native pesticide water. Everyone thought that this was very good and suitable for the new situation. The next day, all twenty-one work teams in the team started doing this, and the effect was equally good. After Old Tan gained experience here, he immediately gathered the heads of the major brigades to visit, and each brigade sent thirty people to study. Comrade Tan Qingxian personally acted as an instructor and taught them this new set of field management methods. Each brigade then convened training classes and trained thousands of cultivation and management experts. Each brigade imitated the methods of the Mingzhengqiao Production Team and quickly and enthusiastically launched field management work. Commune member Zeng Yuxiang said: "Secretary Tan sets an example in everything, the yield will definitely increase, let's see the bumper harvest in the fall!"

    带领群众前进的人
    ——访夏浦公社党委书记谭庆先
    本报记者　周荣
    湘江碧水镶着朝阳金光，是那样平静美丽。两岸田垅红旗飘飘，人们在收割春豆、油菜，赶插中稻，培育早稻，热闹非凡。我从衡山县城外乘轮船到夏浦去，访问夏浦人民公社党委书记谭庆先。
    群力战胜暴风雨
    公社党委办公室的主任陈辉煌接见了我，他说：“谭庆先同志今天回来研究了一下工作，立即又到甘溪大队去了。他的屁股没有坐热过办公室的凳，成天赤脚穿草鞋，和群众在一起工作、学习、生产劳动，你赶紧去，可能找到他本人谈谈，我先打个电话约约他。”说罢，他一面摇电话，一面和我握手。我走出办公室，三脚并两步，赶往七里路远的甘溪大队。
    在大队办公室只会见了值日的秘书罗祥祯，又没有找到谭庆先，老罗说谭庆先又到八里路远的石礄大队检查生产去了。天快黑了，人生地不熟，他要我在这里暂时休息一下。大概是陈辉煌同志打电话告诉了谭庆先同志，刚坐下不久，他就打电话到甘溪大队来，说晚上过来和我谈谈。可是，时间一分又一分钟地过去了，夜半十二点了还没见谭庆先同志回来，我心里又急了。
    骤然，狂风大作，厚厚的乌云遮住了天上的星光，随着雷鸣电闪，大雨倾盆而下，打着瓦背哗哗地响。
    我向窗外望去，风雨的田垅中许多灯光时现时没，披蓑戴笠的社员们正在防洪，保护插下去不久的早稻苗，我心里已完全明白谭庆先同志没回来的原因了。
    这天下午他在石礄大队检查生产时，就想起了今晚有暴风雨来的预报消息。这里是大山区，以往暴风雨来时，就要冲坏上千亩稻田的禾苗。今年不能再叫山洪为害，定要动员群众力量来战胜它！于是他立即找到社干部和有防洪经验的老农们商量办法。开初，他问大家今晚有无大雨下，大伙说：
  “看来天已变了。可能有。”“今年要确保大丰收，下大雨发山洪怎么办？”大伙便说山脚下最近都开了防洪排水圳，一直通到甘溪河里，今晚决心沿圳派人坚守，进一步加固圳沿，准能战胜山洪。谭书记听了大家的话，很佩服群众责任心强、办法多而妙，他同意大家的意见，就这么办。这个队的队干部和社员回去后，立即行动起来了。这时，他就召开了全公社的电话会，把石礄大队的防洪措施转告其他生产队，问其他生产队能否这么办？各队都表示：石礄队能办到，我们也坚决能办到。于是，全公社的群众都行动起来了，在一万三千亩早稻田的排水圳沿线，派驻了力量坚守；然后，他又打电话与各队联系。听说各队的防洪准备工作都做好了，他才由石礄大队赶往甘溪大队。这时，已是晚上十点多钟了。
    他刚进入甘溪大队明正桥生产队时，果然不出所料，暴风雨来了。他忘却了其他一切，立即和群众一道投入了防洪保苗战斗。社员们听说党委书记来了，劲上加劲，油上加油，大喊“不战胜暴风雨，决不休兵”。社员戴葵本，和衣裤连人跳下圳里，迅速挖开了山洪冲来的砂石。社员陈胜芳的灯熄没了，他借着闪电的光从这丘走到那丘田，检查水圳的牢固程度。更多的人都在一齐动手排洪。谭庆先摸着黑巡回指挥战斗。风，掀去了很多人头上戴的?笠，雨，淋透了人们的全身。然而他们屹立在暴风雨中，劲头更大，战斗一直坚持到翌晨四点钟。暴风雨终于过去了，山洪像驯服了的劣马从排水圳里流入洣河。各个大队立即用电话向谭书记告诉了结果：没有损坏一兜禾，而且经过这场战斗增强了人们对战胜灾害的信心和勇气。黑夜过去了，朝阳又从东方露出笑脸。
    田间见证
    早饭后，谭庆先同志来到了大队部，他穿着和社员一样的青衣服，背个大?笠，衣服的袋子里装着书本、文件和笔记本。他同我热情地握着手，开口就说：“违时了，对不起，没有什么可谈的，做的还不够，需要从各方面进一步努力。”我说：“辛苦了，休息一下再谈吧！”他立即表示夜把不睡觉没关系。说今下午还要开现场会，现在抓紧时间到田间看看，边看边谈或许要好些，谈得具体点。于是，我们俩边走边扯起来。
    置身于碧波万顷的早稻田间，心情格外开朗和舒畅。插下去半月的早稻，长得又青又嫩又壮。禾行由北向南，行对行，株对株，整整齐齐，密植规格都是各半为3×5寸和3×6寸。走过一丘又是一丘，来到了妇女萧莲英等人搞的试验丘田边，禾同样长得那么好，密植也完全是那样符合规格。谭庆先说：“今天的妇女可不简单，她们搞的工夫质量也都样样符合要求。”说罢，他把手往泥里一插，泥里肥泡不断滚了上来，泥巴变成了黑污色。这是禾长得好的根本原因之一。他说：全公社一万三千亩早稻，有很多比这丘田还好，比这丘差的是个别丘，社员们对今年大丰收抱有极大的信心。
    这个山冲里的人们，勤劳勇敢，干劲冲天，当党委号召积肥时，男女老少万多人一齐上阵，遍山遍岭都积得是肥。但他们根据历来的习惯，积肥后不沤氹又不制精肥，插秧时便把生肥下到田里，这样肥效不高。为了改变这种粗糙施肥法，公社党委便号召大家沤氹或制精肥，过了一响仍然没人搞，谭庆先便进一步了解原因，发现这里的群众确实不会沤氹打沟，他喊了队干部和社员荣咀、吴向倈等人来试探，他们一点也不会。这就证实了群众并不是偷懒，也并不是不愿打沟沤肥。他立即回到自己搞的试验丘里，打上了沤氹，把肥料下到氹里翻沤，肥料很快就开始腐烂。这时，他就把各队的干部和一些老农请来参观，一边讲解这样做肥料腐烂肥效高的道理，一面告诉大家如何打沟沤肥，如何翻氹等等。当道理被群众了解后，大家又学会了做，回去后五天之内，每亩田都打上了四至七十个氹，把山上的肥全部用车子和空中索道运到了田里。当着晴天普遍翻了两次到三次氹。到插田时，肥料不仅平均每亩达到了一千零四十担，而且都腐烂成熟，发出像大粪一般难闻的臭味。历来施粗肥的习惯，这一下彻底改成了施精肥，这就大大跃进了一步，为今年丰产打下了雄厚基础。
    眼看离插早稻时间不远了，于是公社党委在群众中酝酿密植规格，经过商量和充分讨论后，决定普遍推行3×6寸密植规格。不久，衡山县委生产检查团来到了这里，发现这里普遍深耕在八寸至一尺以上，肥料多至千担以上，质量又好。根据去年丰产经验和技术人员的意见，这里适合于插3×5寸，比插3×6寸每亩可增产一百二十斤稻谷。于是县委便建议他们一半插3×6寸，另一半田改插3×5寸。谭庆先立即召开了公社党委会议讨论，接着便召开了公社党员、团员、作业组长、积极分子以上人员大会讨论。他发现有些人顾虑插3×5寸后不便于中耕追肥，就给大家作了实地表演，大家看到他在田里用中耕器中耕，又追肥，都很自如，顾虑解除了，高兴地回到了各队。同样，各队召开了群众大会，讲道理、实地表演。当群众懂得今年比以往不同，深耕肥多质又好，插3×5寸能多增产，同时又看到同样能中耕追肥除虫后，都热烈拥护县委的建议。这时，谭庆先同志便到一个大队和群众合搞一丘插3×5寸的试验田作为示范，群众更加拥护了。大家立即行动起来，把一部分3×6寸的插秧规格架，改成3×5寸规格架，并送到本大队党总支请求鉴定。各个组都按3×5寸和3×6寸的插秧规格具体规划到田，插秧时就按照规格插了下去。经过检查验收，规格一点不错。谭庆先同志执行党的群众路线，又一次胜利了。
    先当学生，后当先生
    还在早稻开始插秧时，老谭就考虑了田间培育管理的问题。由于“深、肥、密”基础打得好，只要加强管理就能实现高产。如何搞好田间管理呢？情况已不同于去年，必须要有新的办法。
    老谭决心先去请教社干部和老农。这天，他来到甘溪大队明正桥生产队长吴根桂家住了下来。他打定主意先向吴根桂和老农陈胜芳等学习，待共同研究出办法后，再迅速推行。开头他把自己的打算说出来，征求他们的意见。老谭说准备全面组织劳力，突击搞三四次中耕除草和追肥。吴根桂，陈胜芳等人在经过认真考虑后，说这样不行，提出了新的意见：根据深耕密植后的新情况和更多增产的新要求，一个作业组里应抽出四至五个人（占总劳力20％）成立培育管理专业小组，掌握情况的变化来进行培育管理；确定一个兼职看水员管理排灌；同时今年肥多，要看田看禾追肥，不能千篇一律；其他社员就配合搞培育管理。这样或许要好些。谭庆先同志本来就是抱着学习的目的来的，见他们说得分分在理，便放弃了自己原来的意见，表示同意老吴老陈的意见，待试验后再进一步推广。于是，他便把甘溪大队党总支书记萧吕生邀来搞试点。明正桥生产队照这样做了以后，效果很好，群众个个满意。接着，就在这里召开了甘溪大队作业组长现场会议，发动大家提出更多的新办法来。各作业组长来到早稻田间，看到这里中耕除了草，按照各田的具体情况追了肥，合理排灌，因而禾苗长得又嫩又青。同时，每丘田墹都放了大瓦缸，装满了自制土农药水。个个都认为这样搞很好，适合新的情况。第二天，全队二十一个作业组都这样搞起来，效果同样良好。老谭从这里取得了经验后，立即召集了各大队的负责人前来参观，每个大队并派了三十个人前来学习。谭庆先同志就亲自当教员，把这套新的田间管理办法传授给了他们。各个大队然后又召开了训练班，培养了成千个培育管理能手。各个大队仿效明正桥生产队的办法，迅速轰轰烈烈开展了田间管理工作。社员曾玉香说：“谭书记事事做榜样，产量一定能提高，秋后看丰收吧”！
