    Occasional Thoughts on Reading Paintings
    Zhuyin
    Small and Large, Many and Few

    In Song Dynasty painting albums, the painting "Long Bridge Lying on Waves" is a small piece, and although the scenery is simple, it gives the feeling of: a thousand miles in a small space, vast waves, its artistry is not lower than grand masterpieces; "Plowing and Harvesting Picture" is also a small fan painting, but it summarizes the scenes of busy farming and harvest, with a beginning, middle, and end, coherent stories, and a sense of rhythm. There are also a few strokes that depict the clear autumn weather. From this, it can be seen that painting can be small but grand, simple in brushstrokes but rich in meaning, and few can be better than many. But, does this mean that all paintings that are "large" must be small, and all paintings that are "many" must be few? Not so. In the past, there were many long scrolls and paintings of large scenes, such as Zhang Zeduan's "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" in the Song Dynasty, and Wang Shengli's "Eight Women Throw Themselves into the River" in modern times. The more complex the scene, the more distinct the theme, the more people, the more prominent the focus, adding one point is too long, subtracting one point is too short. Not only that, but the most fundamental issue is that it profoundly reflects the social landscape and the mental state of people, which is especially worthy of our study and learning.

    In a sketch review of art creation, some paintings inappropriately pursued "large," deliberately lengthening the painting, as if large size equals great spirit. For the sake of "large," they grabbed a handful from here and a spoonful from there, indiscriminately piling up raw materials, so that some people could be pulled from this end and stuffed into that end, and characters could be moved from that end to this end, without any sense of what is primary and secondary, who is substantial and who is omitted, lacking organic connection. As a result, it appears grand, but the content is empty, or appears separated from the spirit, just an empty shell. This inappropriate trend of pursuing large size for the sake of large size is not a good phenomenon.

    Of course, in order to express our great real life, we not only need long scrolls and huge paintings, but also artists with a poet's bold and open-minded thoughts and feelings. Artists are completely free to gallop their emotions with full energy on the vast fields of the motherland, to sing praises of our great motherland's rapidly changing social landscape and the happy and beautiful life of the people.

    Truth and Aesthetics

    "Crops rely on fertilizer as a flower relies on its base," "The Eight-Character Charter, fertilizer first." In order to increase grain production, people are not afraid of dirt or stench, and they work day and night to find ways to accumulate and create fertilizer. This is one of the manifestations of the Chinese people's diligence and courage. Such a subject is naturally worth expressing. However, this does not mean that we can copy nature and "describe it as it is." Some authors depict a woman carrying a chamber pot to pour manure on the screen, even painting the brush for cleaning the chamber pot in great detail; other authors draw a group of pigs defecating while people are waiting to collect it. Such realistic depictions of these trivial details cause a conditioned reflex after seeing them. The authors have overlooked the most important thing—the depiction of people's thoughts, feelings, and soaring enthusiasm—and highlighted things that should have been concealed or could have been concealed—manure, dirt, and stench.

    Artists use artistic language and beauty to infect and influence appreciators. Even when painting negative characters, there is no need to exaggerate disgusting things that are irrelevant to the essence. If using ugliness, dirt, and stench, instead of using aesthetics, to influence the audience, then it is worth considering. Here, it not only exposes the author's reversal of the object that should be emphasized, but also shows the lack of cooperation between the author's and the appreciator's psychology and wishes. The authors of our traditional New Year pictures have conducted in-depth research on what the masses like and what they are taboo about, and we should learn from this.

    Perhaps some will say, you are afraid of the smell, you lack the correct feelings for fertilizer, and you are attacking the enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer. If the question is raised like this, then it is really an injustice. We can look at it this way: there is a woodcut "Accumulating Fertilizer" that also expresses the theme of accumulating fertilizer, but it emphasizes the activities of people busy accumulating fertilizer in the forest. The golden leaves and the flow of people lead the appreciators into a poetic realm, as if they are experiencing it firsthand. The image and color of the entire painting are beautiful and fresh. Through the depiction of typical environments and typical characters, it attracts the audience to think of going there to participate in accumulating fertilizer. There is also a woodcut of "Sending Fertilizer on a Moonlit Night," where people work selflessly under the moonlight to increase production, carts are like flowing water and horses are like dragons, showing people's soaring enthusiasm and warm atmosphere on the agricultural production front. It can inspire people's fighting spirit and enhance their spirit.

    The artistic effects of the same fertilizer accumulation works are completely different. What is the problem? (Attached pictures)

    读画偶感
    竹音
    小与大、多与少
    宋人画册中，“长桥卧波”一画，尺幅小品，景物虽简，但给人的感觉是：咫尺千里，波涛浩渺，其艺术性并不低于宏篇巨幅；“耕获图”也是尺幅纨扇，却概括了农忙、丰收的情景，有来龙去脉，故事连贯，富有节奏感。也有寥寥数笔画出秋高气爽者。由此可见，作画可以小中见大，笔简意繁，以少胜多。但是，这是不是说，凡画“大”则必小，凡画“多”则必少呢？非也。过去，有不少画长卷，画大场面的，如宋代张择端的“清明上河图”，现代王盛烈的“八女投江”，场面越是复杂，主题越是鲜明，人数越多，重点越突出，增之一分则太长，减之一分则太短。不仅如此，而最根本的问题是深刻地反映了社会面貌和人的精神状态，这一点特别值得我们研究和学习。
    在一次美术创作草图观摩中，有些画不适当的追求“大”，故意把画幅拉长，好像大才有气魄，为了“大”，东抓一把，西凑一勺，无选择的堆砌原始素材，既可以从这端把一些人拉出来塞到那端，又可以从那端把人物搬到这端，何主何宾、谁实谁略，缺乏有机的联系。结果，貌似伟大，而内容空虚，或貌似神离，空有躯壳，这种不适当的为大而大之风，不是一种好现象。
    当然，为了表现我国伟大的现实生活，我们不但需要长卷巨幅，而且更需要艺术家像诗人似的豪迈豁达的思想感情。艺术家完全有自由在祖国辽阔的原野上，精力充沛地让感情骋驰，来歌颂我们伟大的祖国一日千里的社会面貌和人民幸福美好的生活。
    真实与美感
    “庄稼一枝花，全靠肥当家”，“八字宪法，肥料当先”。为了增产粮食，人们不怕脏不怕臭，而夜以继日地想方设法积肥造肥，这是中国人民勤劳勇敢的表现之一。这样的题材自然是值得表现的。但是，这也不等于说，可以照抄自然“如实描写”。有作者在画面上，表现一妇女手提马桶去倒粪，甚至连洗马桶的刷子等都画得非常细致，还有作者画群猪正在屙粪，人在候接。对于这样一些细微末节作逼真的刻画，叫人看后不禁引起条件反射作用，作者忽略了最主要的东西——人的思想感情和冲天干劲的描写，而突出了本来应该或者可以隐蔽的东西——粪、脏、臭。
    艺术家是用艺术的语言，用美去感染和影响欣赏者的，那怕是画反面人物，也无必要去夸张那些与本质无关的令人作呕的东西，如果用丑、脏、臭这些东西，而不是用美感去影响观众，那就值得商榷了。在这里，不仅暴露了作者把应着重表现的对象本末倒置，而且也看出了作者与欣赏者的心理和愿望缺乏合作。我们传统年画的作者，对群众喜欢什么，忌讳什么这一点，是有深入研究的，我们应引为借鉴。
    也许有人会说，你怕臭，是对肥料缺乏正确的感情，你这是打击表现积肥的积极性。如果这样提出问题，那实在是有不白之冤。我们可以看看：有一张木刻“积肥”也是表现积肥题材的，但是，他强调的是树林中来往忙着积肥的人的活动，那金黄的树叶和人流，把欣赏者领进了诗意的境界，犹如亲历其境，整个画幅的形象和色彩优美清新，通过典型环境和典型人物的描写，吸引观众也想到那里去参加积肥。又有一幅“月夜送肥”的木刻，为了增加生产，人们在月光下忘我的劳动，车如流水马如龙，表现出人们在农业生产战线上的冲天干劲和热烈的气氛，它能鼓舞人的斗志，提高人的精神。
    同是积肥作品，艺术效果绝然不同，问题在那里？（附图片）
