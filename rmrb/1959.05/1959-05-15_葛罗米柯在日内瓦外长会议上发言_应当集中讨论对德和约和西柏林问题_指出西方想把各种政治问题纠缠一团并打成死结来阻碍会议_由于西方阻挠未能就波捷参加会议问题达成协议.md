Title: Gromyko Speaks at Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference: Focus Should Be on the German Peace Treaty and the West Berlin Issue; Points Out That the West Wants to Entangle Various Political Issues and Tie Them Into a Dead Knot to Hinder the Meeting; No Agreement Reached on the Issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia Participating in the Meeting Due to Western Obstruction

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 14th (TASS): The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference continued its discussion on the issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia participating in the Geneva conference from the very beginning at the meeting on the 13th. Gromyko raised this proposal at the meeting on the 12th, but it was opposed by the three Western countries. It was later decided to continue discussing this proposal at the meeting on the 13th.

After the chairman of the 13th meeting, Herter, announced the opening of the meeting, he invited the head of the Soviet delegation to speak. Gromyko persuasively condemned the negative attitude adopted by the representatives of the Western countries.

The representatives of the United States, France, and Britain did not mention the Soviet representative's full argument on enabling Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the meeting on an equal footing. They merely reiterated their unchanging attitude in a simple quibble.

Gromyko expressed regret that no agreement had been reached on the issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia participating in the Geneva conference from the outset. He said, "We believe that we can reach an agreement on this issue in the near future, in the next few days, and bring Poland and Czechoslovakia into the conference. These two countries have every legitimate reason and right to participate in this conference."

	Herter Speaks
Next, Herter spoke on behalf of the US delegation. He briefly talked about the development of the situation after the last Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and the Summit Conference, pointing out that the situation had improved in some respects. For example, he actually said that the negotiations on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests were gradually making progress, and some achievements had been made in developing contacts between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of Western countries. When talking about the purpose of the current meeting, Herter said that he believed the purpose of the meeting was: first, to reach positive agreements to the widest possible extent; second, to narrow the differences between the participants in the meeting; and third, to formulate constructive proposals for discussion at the Summit Conference. Herter said that this meeting could be a prelude to a high-level meeting if the participants in this meeting could achieve satisfactory results. He also said that the United States was prepared to participate in the Summit Conference. The United States will make the most serious efforts to conclude agreements that can ease international tensions.

	De Murville Speaks
Next, the French representative, Lucet, read a written statement by De Murville, who could not attend today's meeting due to illness. This statement said that in 1955, an attempt was made to resolve the problems that emerged after the war, and the current situation is more acute than the period after 1955. De Murville groundlessly shifted this responsibility to the Soviet Union, insisting that the proposals made by the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue six months ago had caused a crisis in the situation. In his speech, De Murville assured that France would strive to create conditions for the conclusion of good agreements. He also said that if the current meeting achieved positive results, it would pave the way for convening a high-level meeting.

	Gromyko Speaks
The head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, then spoke. Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation, in starting its work, was willing to express that the Soviet government was satisfied with the agreement reached on holding this Foreign Ministers' Conference and convening a Summit Conference in the near future. Cooperation among the four countries sitting at a conference table to resolve major international issues has been interrupted for a long time. The convening of this Foreign Ministers' Conference marks the first step in restoring this cooperation.

Gromyko said that since its founding, the Soviet Union has consistently and on principle advocated that all countries, regardless of their social systems and political structures, should coexist peacefully. Our country possesses all the necessary means to defend its interests from any infringement and to effectively defend against all kinds of aggression. At the same time, it is making every effort to eliminate the possibility of endangering peace and to develop friendly cooperation with all other countries.

Gromyko pointed out that the fact that representatives of the two Germanys were present at the Foreign Ministers' Conference was of great significance and a good sign that gives rise to hope. We believe that this is a real step in the right direction. The participation of representatives of the two Germanys in our work will help to solve the tasks of the conference in the spirit of consolidating peace and easing international tensions, especially easing European tensions.

Gromyko continued, "The participants in our conference bear a great responsibility, not only to their own governments, but also to the people of all countries, because the people of all countries expect this conference to be the beginning of a desired turning point in the current development of international relations."

Gromyko pointed out that perhaps never before has there been such an urgent need to take measures to ease international tensions and reduce the threat of war. Because at present, the major powers of the world are in mutually hostile military blocs, and there is no place on earth that can escape the flames of war once mankind is plunged into a new war. Under these circumstances, an agreement among the major powers and a guarantee of peaceful coexistence by all countries has become a matter of life and death for millions upon millions of people.

Therefore, Gromyko said, it is particularly important to clear away the accumulated vestiges left over from World War II from international relations. Who can deny that the edifice of lasting peace cannot be built if the last war is not completely ended? However, this is precisely what has not been done in the center of Europe, where there is still no peace treaty with Germany.

Gromyko said that it is difficult to find reasons to continue to delay negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany. We have reached agreements on concluding a state treaty with Austria and on concluding peace treaties with all European countries that once fought on the side of Germany. This shows that as long as there is sincerity, mutually acceptable solutions can and should be found on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

Gromyko said that the whole world sees that some people are stepping up efforts to turn West German territory into a frontline for nuclear war. Everyone knows that any action inevitably causes a reaction. The logic of things (including foreign policy) is like this. However, the Soviet Union prefers not to follow the path of continuing to deepen existing contradictions and further inflaming the situation in Germany and Europe, but rather to follow the path of normalizing the situation and reducing the danger of war. That is why the Soviet government advocates the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and suggests discussing this issue at the current conference.

Gromyko continued, "For the same reason, we believe that eliminating the current extremely abnormal and dangerous situation in West Berlin is an urgent task. West Berlin is still under the military occupation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is particularly intolerable that this system exists in a city in the center of one of the two existing sovereign Germanys – the German Democratic Republic."

Gromyko also said that under modern conditions, the reunification of Germany can only be achieved through negotiations between the governments of the two Germanys, and no external force should interfere in this internal affair of the German people. It cannot be ignored that the conclusion of a peace treaty can improve the entire international atmosphere, thereby helping to bring the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany closer together. It can be seen that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany will greatly help solve the national problem of the German people – the establishment of a unified Germany.

Gromyko said that solving the Berlin issue will not only eliminate an important source of international tension, but will also be a contribution to German reunification. It should be frankly said that only those who intend to maintain the division of Germany are delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty and delaying the solution of the West Berlin issue.

The Soviet Foreign Minister continued, "In our view, in recent months, there have been important points of convergence, even coinciding views, on some of these international issues, which is also an exciting factor."

Gromyko continued, "The Soviet government has put forward concrete proposals on the peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue, namely: a draft peace treaty with Germany and a proposal on turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. The Soviet government firmly believes that these proposals are an excellent basis for discussing the issues we face. Of course, we are happy to discuss any constructive opinions that other countries participating in the conference may put forward regarding the solution of these issues."

Gromyko said, "Of course, it would be incorrect to close our eyes to the difficulties before us. Unfortunately, the environment in which our conference began its work is far from good in all respects. Not long ago, the Soviet government expressed its concern in notes handed to the governments of many countries about the actions taken by certain members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I am referring to the recent measures taken by the United States to step up the establishment of nuclear missile bases on the territory of other countries and to step up the arming of the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons."

Gromyko then emphasized that if this path is followed, then, needless to say, the other side will also confront the negotiating counterpart with a series of accomplished facts in terms of political actions and military preparations, and the other side's potential in this regard is not small either.

Gromyko believed that not all governments participating in the conference had shown the necessary desire to ease the situation and reach agreements, at least not until now. He pointed out that if, in the course of the conference, someone attempts to trip up the participants with heavy obstacles, preventing them from making any progress towards reaching an agreement, then it must be bluntly said that whoever does this will bear a great responsibility for the consequences. We want to say frankly that the attitude of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is still a considerable obstacle, hindering the efforts of countries to make Europe a stronghold of lasting peace and to spare the people of Europe, including the German people, from the threat of a new war.

Gromyko pointed out that news from Western countries that some people are attempting to entangle various political issues into a single ball by artificial mutual involvement and hand it over to the participants of our conference in a dead knot cannot but cause a certain degree of concern. It should be frankly said that we feel that adopting such an attitude towards things is tantamount to closing down all our work.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that discussing all, or many, international issues at the same conference can only lead to lengthy disputes and will only delay the resolution of each issue discussed. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet delegation, which is concerned about the success of our conference, suggests discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and normalizing the situation in West Berlin at the conference. Achieving success in resolving these acute issues would be the best proof of the sincerity of all conference participants, and it would also create favorable conditions for the subsequent smooth resolution of other outstanding issues.

Gromyko said that our conference also has a task, which is to formulate unanimously agreed recommendations on the time, place, and possible agenda for the Summit Conference.

Gromyko also said that if the high-level meeting could be somewhat regular in nature, then this would be a good thing for the cause of peace.

	Lloyd Speaks
The last to speak was the British Foreign Secretary, Lloyd. He expressed satisfaction with the convening of this conference. He said that he, like Gromyko and others, hoped to improve the atmosphere. He agreed with many aspects of Gromyko's speech, but he disagreed with the various arguments in this speech. He expressed particular disagreement with the statement that there are two sovereign Germanys and that the issue of German reunification is an internal affair of the German people. Lloyd then insisted that the issue of restoring German unity, the issue of European security, and the Berlin issue are interrelated.

Lloyd agreed with Gromyko's remarks about Macmillan and his visit to Moscow. He said, "We held extremely beneficial negotiations. These negotiations led to a correct mutual understanding, and the results of our negotiations were correctly reflected in the joint communiqué."

Lloyd pointed out that he agreed with the view that mutually acceptable solutions must be reached. He said that the British government believes that a series of meetings must be held because the issues are too complex to be resolved all at once. Lloyd pointed out that both sides are concerned about maintaining peace, easing tensions, and expanding contacts. He expressed the hope that although the conference began in a somewhat unfavorable atmosphere, it will achieve better results than the 1955 Foreign Ministers' Conference. The meeting adjourned after Lloyd's speech. The Foreign Ministers will continue to meet on the afternoon of the 14th.

    葛罗米柯在日内瓦外长会议上发言
    应当集中讨论对德和约和西柏林问题
    指出西方想把各种政治问题纠缠一团并打成死结来阻碍会议
    由于西方阻挠未能就波捷参加会议问题达成协议
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议在13日的会议上继续讨论波兰和捷克斯洛伐克一开始就参加日内瓦会议的问题。葛罗米柯在12日会议上提出这项建议，但是遭到西方三国的反对，后来决定在13日的会议上继续讨论这项建议。
    13日会议执行主席赫脱宣布开会后就请苏联代表团团长发言，葛罗米柯很有说服力地谴责了西方国家代表们采取的否定态度。
    美国、法国和英国的代表只字不提苏联代表关于使波兰和捷克斯洛伐克完全平等地参加会议的充分论证，而只是在简单的强辩中重申不改变他们的态度。
    葛罗米柯对于没有就波兰和捷克斯洛伐克在一开始就参加日内瓦会议的问题达成协议表示遗憾。他说，我们相信，我们能够在最近期间，在最近一些日子里就这个问题达成协议，吸收波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加会议，这两个国家是有一切合法的理由和权利来参加这次会议的。
    赫脱发言
    接着，赫脱以美国代表团的名义发言。他在简短地谈到上次日内瓦外长会议和政府首脑会议之后的局势发展情况时指出，在某些方面的情况已有所好转。例如，他竟说，就停止核武器试验问题举行的谈判在逐步取得进展，在发展苏联人民和西方国家人民的接触方面取得了某种成就。赫脱在谈到目前会议的目的时说，他认为会议的目的在于：第一，在尽可能广泛的范围内达成积极的协议，第二，缩小会议参加者之间的分歧，第三，拟定提供政府首脑会议讨论的建设性建议。赫脱说，这次会议能够成为高级会议的序幕，如果这次会议参加者能够获得令人满意的成绩的话。他还说，美国准备参加政府首脑会议。美国将作最认真的努力来缔结能够缓和国际紧张局势的协定。
    德姆维尔发言
    接着，法国代表吕赛宣读了德姆维尔的书面发言，后者因病不能出席今天的会议。这个发言说，1955年曾试图解决战后出现的问题，现在的局势比1955年以后的时期更为加剧。德姆维尔毫无根据地把这种责任推给苏联，硬说什么苏联在六个月之前就柏林问题提出的建议使局势发生危机。德姆维尔在发言中保证，法国将努力创造条件来缔结良好的协定。他还说，如果目前的会议获得积极结果，就将为召开高级会议开辟道路。
    葛罗米柯发言
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯接着发言。葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团在着手工作时愿意表示，苏联政府对就举行这次外长会议和在最近召开政府首脑会议的问题达成的协议感到满意。四国坐在一张会议桌上为解决国际重大问题的合作已经中断了一个很长的时期，这次外长会议的召开标志着在恢复这种合作方面迈出了第一步。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联自建国之日起，就有原则地和始终不渝地主张，一切国家不论其社会制度和政治结构如何，都应该和平共处。我们国家拥有一切必要的手段来保卫自己利益不遭受任何侵犯，以及有效地防御各种侵略。同时，它正在尽一切努力排除危害和平的可能性，同所有其他国家发展友好合作。
    葛罗米柯指出，两个德国的代表出席了外长会议这一件事有着巨大的意义，这是一个使人产生希望的好征兆。我们认为，这是朝着正确的方向迈出的现实的一步。两个德国的代表参加我们的工作将会有助于本着巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势、特别是缓和欧洲紧张局势的精神来解决会议的任务。
    葛罗米柯接着说，我们这次会议的参加者承担着不小的责任，他们不仅对本国政府，而且对各国人民也有这种责任，因为各国人民都期待着这次会议能成为在当前国际关系发展中所期望的转折的开端。
    葛罗米柯指出，也许，任何时候都没有像现在这样迫切地需要采取措施来缓和国际紧张局势，减轻爆发战争的威胁。因为在目前，世界大国处于彼此敌对的军事集团之中，地球上再没有一块地方在人类一旦被卷入新战争的时候能够不被战火烧到。在这种情况下，各大国达成协议，所有国家都保证和平共处，便成为千千万万人的生和死的问题。
    因此，葛罗米柯说，从国际关系中清除第二次世界大战遗留下来的积垢是特别重要的。谁能否认如果不把上次战争彻底结束便不可能建立起持久和平的大厦？然而，正是这一点，在欧洲中心至今尚没有做到，这里仍然还没有签订对德和约。
    葛罗米柯说，很难找到理由来继续拖延对德和约谈判。我们已经就同奥地利签订国家条约以及就同所有曾经站在德国方面作战的欧洲国家缔结和约问题达成了协议。这说明，只要有诚意，在对德和约问题上也可以而且应该找到双方可以接受的解决办法。
    葛罗米柯说，全世界都看到，有人正加紧把西德领土变成进行核战争的前沿阵地，大家知道，任何作用必然引起反作用，事物（其中也包括外交政策）的逻辑就是如此。但是，苏联宁愿不走继续加深现存矛盾和使德国和欧洲的局势更加白热化的道路，而是要走使局势正常化和减少战争危险的道路。这就是为什么苏联政府主张刻不容缓地缔结对德和约并建议在目前的会议上讨论这个问题。
    葛罗米柯接着说，由于同样的理由，我们认为，消除西柏林目前的极为不正常和危险的局面是一项亟待解决的任务。西柏林至今还处在北大西洋公约组织的军事占领下。特别令人不能容忍的是，这种制度是存在于两个现存的主权德国之一——德意志民主共和国中心的一个城市。
    葛罗米柯还说，在现代的条件下，德国的恢复统一只能通过两个德国的政府举行谈判来实现，任何外力都不得干涉德国人民的这个内政。不能不看到，缔结和约就能使整个国际气氛好转，从而有助于德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的接近。可见，缔结对德和约就会对解决德国人民的全民族问题——建立统一的德国问题有很大的帮助。
    葛罗米柯说，解决柏林问题不但能消除国际紧张局势的一个重要策源地，并且也是对德国统一的一个贡献。应该坦率地说，现在只有打算保持德国分裂状态的人才会拖延缔结和约和拖延解决西柏林问题。
    苏联外长接着说，据我们看，最近几个月，对这些国际问题中的某些问题有了重要的接近之点，甚至有了相吻合的看法，这也是一个令人兴奋的因素。
    葛罗米柯继续说，苏联政府曾就对德和约和西柏林问题提出了具体的建议，这就是：对德和约草案和关于把西柏林变为非军事化自由城市的建议，苏联政府深信，这些建议是讨论我们面临的问题的极好的基础。当然，我们乐意讨论参加会议的其他国家可能提出的有关解决这些问题的一切建设性的意见。
    葛罗米柯说，当然，闭起眼睛不看摆在我们面前的困难是不正确的。遗憾的是，我们的会议开始工作的环境远不是在一切方面都是良好的。不久以前，苏联政府曾经在交给许多国家政府的照会中对北大西洋公约组织的某些成员国所采取的行动表示不安，我指的是，最近，美国加紧在别国领土上建立核火箭基地和加紧用原子武装装备西德联邦国防军的措施。
    葛罗米柯接着强调说，如果走这条道路，那么，不用说，另一方也会把谈判的对方置于政治行动和军事准备方面一系列既成事实的面前，另一方在这方面的潜力也并不较小。
    葛罗米柯认为，并非会议所有参加国政府都对缓和局势和达成协议表现了应有的愿望，起码到现在为止是这样。他指出，如果在会议过程中有人企图用沉重的障碍物绊住与会者的双脚，阻碍他们丝毫不能向达成协议进展，那么必须不客气地说，谁要这样做，谁就得对后果负重大责任。我们要开诚布公地说，德意志联邦共和国政府的态度至今仍然是一个不小的障碍，它阻碍着各国为了使欧洲变为巩固的和平堡垒，使欧洲各国人民，其中包括德国人民免于新战争威胁而作的努力。
    葛罗米柯指出，来自西方国家的消息说，有人企图用人为的相互牵扯的方法把各种政治问题纠缠成一团，并打成一个死结交给我们会议的参加者，这种消息不能不使人感到一定的忧虑。应该坦率地说，我们觉得，对事情抱这样的态度，就等于封闭我们全部的工作。
    苏联外长说，在一次会议上同时讨论所有的，或者是许多的国际问题，只能产生长时期的争论，只会拖延解决所讨论的每一个问题。正因为如此，关心我们会议的工作有所成就的苏联代表团，建议在会上讨论对德和约和使西柏林局势正常化的问题。在解决这些尖锐问题方面取得成就，会是全体会议参加者具有诚意的最好证明，它也将为随后顺利解决其他悬而未决的问题创造良好的条件。
    葛罗米柯说，我们的会议还有一个任务，就是对政府首脑会议召开的时间、地点和可能的议程拟定一致同意的建议。
    葛罗米柯还说，如果最高级会议能多少带有定期的性质，那么，这对和平事业将是一件好事。
    劳埃德发言
    最后发言的是英国外交大臣劳埃德。他对这次会议的召开表示满意。他说，他同葛罗米柯等人一样希望改善气氛。他同意葛罗米柯在发言中谈到的许多方面，但是，他不同意这个发言的各种论点。他表示特别不同意这样的说法：存在两个主权的德国，德国统一问题是德国人自己的内政。劳埃德接着硬说，恢复德国统一问题、欧洲安全问题同柏林问题有着相互关系。
    劳埃德同意葛罗米柯说的关于麦克米伦和他访问莫斯科的话。他说，我们举行了极为有益的谈判，这次谈判导致了正确的相互了解，而且在联合公报中正确地反映了我们谈判的结果。
    劳埃德指出，他赞同关于必须达成相互能够接受的解决办法的意见。他说，英国政府认为，必须举行一系列的会议，因为问题太复杂了，要一下子解决，是不可能的。劳埃德指出，双方都关心维护和平，缓和紧张局势和扩大接触，他表示希望，虽然会议是在有些不妙的气氛中开始的，它将会比1955年的外长会议取得较为良好的结果。会议在劳埃德发言之后休会。外长们将在14日下午继续开会。
