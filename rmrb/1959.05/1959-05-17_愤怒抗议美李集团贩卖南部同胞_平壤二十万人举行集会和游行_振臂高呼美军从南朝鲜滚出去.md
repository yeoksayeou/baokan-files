Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th - Two hundred thousand people in Pyongyang held a rally and demonstration this afternoon to protest the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique's "immigration" conspiracy to sell the South Korean people as slaves to foreign countries.

This afternoon, Pyongyang citizens, enraged by the Syngman Rhee clique's treasonous conspiracy, gathered in Kim Il-sung Square and nearby streets. Carrying huge banners and cartoons, they constantly raised their arms and shouted slogans such as "Condemn the US and Syngman Rhee clique's 'immigration' conspiracy," "Yankees get out of South Korea," and "Let us all mobilize for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland!"

Kim Il, First Vice Premier of the Cabinet; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Jung Joon-taek; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, and Kim Chang-man; and Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front Kim Chun-hae attended the meeting. Baek Nam-un, a representative of the Fatherland Front, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Syngman Rhee clique recently formally established a slave trading institution specializing in trafficking people – the "Overseas Immigration Committee" – to step up the implementation of its long-planned "immigration" conspiracy. The Korean people express great anger at this crime of the Syngman Rhee clique.

Baek Nam-un, while severely condemning the Syngman Rhee clique for implementing the "immigration" conspiracy under the pretext of so-called "overpopulation," said that today South Korea has 6.6 million unemployed people and millions of farmers cannot obtain food. However, this is the result of the US's aggressive policies in South Korea and the dark rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, which has bankrupted the South Korean economy, and not because of "overpopulation."

Baek Nam-un pointed out that the Syngman Rhee clique attempts to sell South Korean unemployed people and North Korean residents abducted to South Korea to foreign countries as lifelong slaves, so that they can never return to their homeland. The Korean people must not stand idly by to the Syngman Rhee clique's crime of trafficking people. He said that socialist construction is proceeding rapidly in North Korea, and we welcome South Korean compatriots to come and live a happy life with us. We firmly demand that the South Korean authorities send all the people to be sold abroad to North Korea.

Baek Nam-un called on the unemployed in South Korea not to become "immigrants" of the Syngman Rhee clique, and called on conscientious people in South Korea to rise up and oppose this crime of the Syngman Rhee clique.

Subsequently, representatives from the workers', farmers', youth, and cultural circles spoke at the meeting, unanimously condemning and protesting this crime of the Syngman Rhee clique.

After the meeting, a demonstration was held. A crowd of 200,000 people marched through the streets of Pyongyang, shouting slogans such as "Yankees get out of South Korea" and "Strive for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th - Seoul dispatch: The Syngman Rhee clique is continuing to promote the so-called "immigration" plan to sell the South Korean people to foreign capitalists and farmers as slaves.

According to the South Korean News Agency, on May 11th, the Syngman Rhee clique officially announced the establishment of the so-called "Overseas Immigration Committee," with the "Foreign Minister" of the Syngman Rhee clique serving as the chairman of the committee, to implement the "immigration" conspiracy.

It is revealed that the Syngman Rhee clique has already reached agreements with some South American countries and Southeast Asian Treaty Organization governments on trafficking people. Several months ago, the Syngman Rhee clique's ambassador to the United States went to these countries to negotiate.

For the thirteen years since the end of World War II, South Korea has suffered from economic decline and the people have lived in misery as a result of the rule and exploitation of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. The number of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed has recently reached more than 6.6 million. In order to alleviate its economic crisis, the Syngman Rhee clique sells a batch of South Korean people, whose blood and sweat have been squeezed dry, to foreign countries as slaves. The targets of this so-called "immigration" are civilians, unemployed people, and Rhee's puppet army personnel who were abducted from North Korea to South Korea by the US-Syngman Rhee army during the war.

    愤怒抗议美李集团贩卖南部同胞
    平壤二十万人举行集会和游行
    振臂高呼美军从南朝鲜滚出去
    新华社平壤16日电　平壤市二十万人今天下午举行集会和示威游行，抗议美帝国主义和李承晚集团把南朝鲜人民当做奴隶卖给外国的所谓“移民”阴谋。
    今天下午，被李承晚集团的卖国阴谋激怒了的平壤市民聚集在金日成广场和附近的街道上。他们抬着巨幅标语和漫画，不断振臂高呼
  “谴责美国和李承晚集团的‘移民’阴谋”、“美军从南朝鲜滚出去”、
  “为了祖国的和平统一大家一致动员起来”等口号。
    朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一，内阁副首相郑一龙、南日、郑准泽，劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，祖国战线中央委员会议长团议长金天海等出席了大会。祖国战线代表白南云在会上讲了话。他说：李承晚集团最近正式组成了专门贩卖人口的奴隶交易机构——“海外移民委员会”，来加紧实现它的蓄谋已久的“移民”阴谋。朝鲜人民对李承晚集团的这种罪行表示极大的愤怒。
    白南云在严厉谴责李承晚集团以所谓“人口过剩”为借口来实现“移民”阴谋时说，今天南朝鲜有六百六十万失业人口，数百万农民得不到粮食，但是，这是美国在南朝鲜的侵略政策和李承晚集团的黑暗统治使南朝鲜经济破产的结果，而不是什么“人口过剩”。
    白南云指出：李承晚集团企图把南朝鲜的失业者以及劫运到南朝鲜去的北朝鲜居民等贩卖给外国充当终身奴隶，使他们永远不能回到自己的祖国，朝鲜人民决不能对李承晚集团这种贩卖人口的罪行袖手旁观。他说，朝鲜北部正在迅速地进行着社会主义建设，我们欢迎南朝鲜同胞来同我们一起过幸福的生活。我们坚决要求南朝鲜当局把要卖往外国的所有的人都送到朝鲜北部。
    白南云号召南朝鲜的失业者不要去充当李承晚集团的“移民”，号召南朝鲜有良心的人起来反对李承晚集团的这一罪行。
    接着，工人、农民、青年和文化界的代表在会上讲了话，他们一致谴责和抗议李承晚集团的这一罪行。
    会后举行了示威游行，二十万人的群众队伍浩浩荡荡地走过平壤各条大街，他们高呼“美军从南朝鲜滚出去”、“争取祖国和平统一”等口号。
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：李承晚集团正在继续推行把南朝鲜人民卖给外国资本家和农场主作奴隶的所谓“移民”计划。
    据南朝鲜通讯社报道，5月11日，李承晚集团正式宣布成立了所谓“海外移民委员会”，由李承晚集团的“外务部长官”担任这个委员会的委员长，来实行“移民”阴谋。
    据透露，李承晚集团已经同一些南美国家和东南亚条约国家政府谈成了贩卖人口的交易。几个月以前，李承晚集团的驻美大使曾到这些国家去谈判。
    第二次世界大战后十三年来，南朝鲜由于美国和李承晚集团统治和压榨的结果，经济雕敝，民不聊生。完全失业者和半失业者最近已达到六百六十多万。李承晚集团为了缓和它的经济危机，就把榨干了血汗的一批南朝鲜人民，当做奴隶卖往外国。他们这次所谓“移民”的对象就是战时被美李军队从朝鲜北部劫往南朝鲜的平民、失业者和李伪军人员。
