Xinhua News Agency, May 20th News: The first group of over one hundred and fifty Tibetan students graduating this year from schools such as the Central Institute for Nationalities, boarded a train today, singing songs, and headed towards Tibet to build their beautiful homeland.

Before their departure, faculty and students of over forty ethnic groups at the Central Institute for Nationalities held a warm send-off meeting to bid farewell to the students going to Tibet. At the meeting, Zong Qun, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Institute, wished the students going to Tibet continuous victories in the cause of building a new Tibet. The Secretary of the Institute's Communist Youth League Committee, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, presented each student going to Tibet with a gold "May Fourth" Movement 40th Anniversary Medal, hoping that they would carry forward the "May Fourth" spirit and do a good job. The workers of the Institute's printing factory stayed up all night last night to rush-print the latest issue of the Institute's journal and gave it to the students going to Tibet. The students going to Tibet kept this issue of the journal as a precious souvenir.

After the news of these Tibetan students going back to Tibet to work was published in the newspapers, they received congratulatory letters from Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. All the Hui students of Beijing Normal University said in their letter to them: "You are about to engage in an extremely glorious and historically significant undertaking. Some of us will also be graduating this year. Everyone cherishes a beautiful wish, which is to go to Tibet, to serve the Tibetan people, and to build a new Tibet with you." Before their departure, the students going to Tibet sent a thank-you letter to their friends who had written to them, through the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The letter said: "The congratulatory, exhortative, and encouraging letters you sent from all directions inspire our burning hearts with every word. In addition to expressing our gratitude to you in this letter, we also plan to answer your expectations of us with excellent achievements in the struggle against the traitorous elements, and in the cause of democratic reform and socialist construction after entering Tibet."

Sa Kongliao and Xie Hechou, Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Yan Xinmin, Vice President of the Central Institute for Nationalities, Party and government cadres of the Institute, and students of all ethnic groups, went to the station today to see off the students going to Tibet.

The remaining fifty-plus Tibetan students graduating this year will also be setting off for Tibet soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Xianyang, May 20th News: The Tibet Public School, located in Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, has over one thousand one hundred Tibetan students who, after a year of study, have recently been returning to Tibet in batches to participate in construction.

These Tibetan students are all children of farmers and herdsmen. Many students' parents and siblings were killed by slave owners, and many students personally suffered persecution from slave owners. When the news of the rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary ruling clique in Tibet came, these Tibetan students were very angry, and successively denounced the crimes of the rebels and the Tibetan serf owners, and posted big-character posters and submitted pledges, requesting to return to their hometowns to participate in the work of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet, expressing their eternal loyalty to the motherland, and to be good sons and daughters of the Party and Chairman Mao.

Before these Tibetan students departed, the school held a grand farewell party for them.

    在动身之前，中央民族学院四十多个民族的师生举行了热烈的欢送会，欢送去西藏的同学们。会上，学院党委副书记宗群预祝去西藏同学在建设新西藏的事业中，不断获得胜利。学院团委书记代表共青团中央给每个去西藏同学颁发了一枚金色的“五四”运动四十周年纪念章，希望他们发扬“五四”精神，做好工作。学院印刷厂的工人们昨晚通宵未睡，赶印出了最新一期院刊，送给去西藏的同学们。去西藏的同学们都把这一期院刊作为珍贵的纪念品保存起来。
    当这批藏族学生将要回西藏工作的消息在报上登出以后，他们收到了从北京、天津等地寄来的贺信。北京师范大学全体回族同学在给他们的信上说：“你们即将从事一件极光荣和具有历史意义的事业。我们当中有些人在今年也将毕业。大家都怀有一个美好的愿望，那就是到西藏去，为藏族人民服务，和你们一起建设新西藏。”去西藏同学在出发之前，通过中央人民广播电台给写信给他们的朋友们回了一封感谢信，信上说：“你们从四面八方寄来的祝贺、嘱托、鼓励的信，每一个字都激励着我们火热的心。我们除在这封信中向你们表示感谢外，我们还准备在进藏后，在同叛国分子的斗争中，在民主改革和建设社会主义的事业中，用优良的成绩来回答你们对我们的期望。”
