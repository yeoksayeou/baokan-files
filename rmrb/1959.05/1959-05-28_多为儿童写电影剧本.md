Write More Film Scripts for Children
Shanghai Teachers College Fang Chongzhi

My nine-year-old niece, while “fighting a war” with a group of children, was “unluckily” taken prisoner. When the “enemy” put the “tip of a gun” to her head and a “big knife” to her neck, she didn’t cry or beg for mercy, but shouted loudly: “Long live the Communist Party!” “…” One boy wanted her to kneel down, but she tossed her braids and pouted: “Haven’t you seen ‘The Daughter of the Party’? When did you ever see Yu Mei kne——el before the enemy!” These are the words of a child, but from them, I deeply realize what a great role the images of heroes in literary and artistic works play in the hearts of children! But unfortunately, there are too few works written for children now. If we were to pick and choose from this "too few" number, then there would be even fewer! However, it is our inescapable responsibility to better cultivate the next generation.

Children like watching movies very much, but there are really not many movies suitable for children to watch (not to mention films made specifically for children). As a result, they have to watch the same movies as adults. Although sometimes they don’t understand or don’t fully understand, I think if we could write some good film literary scripts suitable for children's tastes, and then make them into movies, what a great role this would play in children's education! I hope writers and authors will write more things for children. This year, many professional writers and amateur authors plan to write film literary scripts as gifts for the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Therefore, I would like to remind them: don’t forget the children! Please pay attention to some child-related themes when writing "big themes" and write something for the children.

    多为儿童写电影剧本
    上海师范学院  方崇智
    我九岁的小侄女，和一群孩子“打着仗”，“不幸”做了俘虏。当“敌人”把“枪尖”抵着她脑袋，“大刀”架上脖子的时候；她不哭也没求饶，却高嚷着：“共产党万岁！”“……”。有一个男孩子要她跪下，她甩着小辫子噘起了嘴：“你没看过‘党的女儿’？几时见玉梅——给敌人下跪！”这是孩子的话，但从这话里，却使我深刻地体会到，文艺作品里的英雄形象，在儿童们的心里起着多么大的作用！但可惜的是，现在为儿童写的作品实在太少了。假如再在这“太少”的数目里挑选一下的话，那就更少了！然而，更好地培育下一代，却是我们义不容辞的责任。
    对看电影，孩子们是非常喜欢的，但适合儿童们看的电影（不要说专为儿童拍的片子），却实在不多。结果他们也只好和大人看一样的影片，虽然有时看不懂或不全懂，我想，如果能为孩子们写一些适合他们口味的好的电影文学剧本，再拍成影片；这对孩子们的教育，将起多大的作用啊！我希望作家和作者们多为孩子们写些东西。今年有很多专业作家和业余作者打算写电影文学剧本给国庆十周年献礼。因此，我想提醒一下：别忘了孩子们！请在写“大题材”的时候，也能注意一些有关儿童的题材，为孩子们写一些东西出来。
