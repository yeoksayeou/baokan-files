　　I fully support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of the leading comrades. Premier Zhou's report is very comprehensive. It summarizes the great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan and 1958, and proposes the economic tasks for 1959, as well as culture, education, national political life, and foreign policy. I am a chemistry worker and teach in the Chemistry Department of Peking University, so I will only talk about the development of chemical education and research from the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan to the present. Although the scope of what I talk about is narrow, the content is something I know relatively accurately, so it can be considered a personal experience.

　　First, I want to talk about the development of chemical education. In 1952, under the leadership of the Party, a nationwide adjustment of departments in institutions of higher education was carried out. At this time, the Chemistry Department of Peking University had 330 students and 36 teachers. In the winter of 1958, there were 164 teachers and 1,102 students. The number of students increased by 3.3 times that of 1952, and the number of teachers by 4.6 times. This is an increase in quantity. In terms of quality, before 1952, only professors could give lectures in class, and lecturers and teaching assistants could only be responsible for guiding experiments. What about now? The courses in the Chemistry Department of Peking University are mainly taught by lecturers and teaching assistants, including basic courses, specialized courses, and some specialized courses. For example, I used to teach physical chemistry, chemical thermodynamics, and statistical chemistry before 1952, but now they are all taught by young lecturers, and they teach very well. These courses were previously thought to be taught only by teachers who had been "gilded" abroad, but young teachers are competent. From this simple example, it can be seen that under the correct educational policy of the state and the wise leadership of the Party, the growth of young teachers, both in quantity and quality, has been unprecedentedly rapid. This is an achievement that "educators" in capitalist countries cannot dream of.

　　In terms of courses, our Chemistry Department has established many specializations, such as polymer chemistry, rare elements, instrumental analysis, isotopy chemistry specialization (these were all not available in our country before), and recently newly established organic catalysis, electrochemistry, semiconductor chemistry (the latter is not even available in capitalist countries) specialization, etc. These specializations are either closely related to the national economy or are cutting-edge sciences, with in-depth theories and can play a significant role in national construction, fully in line with the requirements of combining theory with practice. Without the leadership of the Party and the help of Soviet experts, relying solely on the original few professors, these courses would not have been established until who knows when, and some might never have been established because we did not have such experts. In other words, in a short period of five years, the Party has raised chemical education to the latest and most modern level. Chemical majors in other institutions of higher education have had similar developments, and Peking University is just one of them.

　　During the Great Leap Forward, the Chemistry Department of Peking University responded to the government's call for the combination of education, labor, and production, and established fourteen factories (now merged into five factories) to produce chemical products needed by the country. Subsequently, teachers and students also participated in steelmaking work (Guangxi, Hunan, and Beijing campuses). This allowed them to come into contact with the practice of chemistry and truly achieve the point of applying what they have learned. More importantly, there were political gains. Many bourgeois intellectuals, through practical labor and contact with workers and peasants, accelerated their transformation into proletarian intellectuals and played an active role in socialist construction. For example, most of the university students trained in the past were individualists who were divorced from the working people. The thoughts and qualities of today's students are far from what they used to be.

　　Secondly, I would like to talk about China's chemical research. During the period of reactionary rule, chemical research was miserably poor, and only a very small number of research institutes and institutions of higher education with better conditions could conduct a little research. After liberation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences established several chemical research institutes, and institutions of higher education universally increased equipment and books, and production units also established research institutions. Chemical research has gradually become a widespread phenomenon, and the number of published papers has increased day by day. In addition to several national chemical journals, institutions of higher education and production units have published their own journals and special publications. I recently participated in the compilation of "Ten Years of Chemistry in China" and learned about some research situations. The chemistry section is divided into sixteen categories. In ten years, the research papers in these sixteen categories, the least numerous category had forty or fifty papers, and the most numerous had more than five hundred papers. The number of papers in one of these categories (such as the most numerous category) can be compared to the number of all chemistry papers during the twenty years of Kuomintang rule. Due to the increase in instruments and reagents, the research has also been more in-depth, the data is more abundant, and in terms of quality, the papers are also much higher than before. Therefore, the leadership of the Party has unprecedentedly superior effects on chemical research, both in quantity and quality.

　　More importantly, the Party has led the chemical community to establish research in chemical departments that are of great importance to the national economy. Taking polymer chemistry as an example, polymer products are of great importance in industry, national defense, and daily life, but before liberation, no one in the country was specifically doing this kind of research, and there was not even this course in schools. Under the leadership of the Party and the help of Soviet experts, the Academy of Sciences began polymer research in 1952, and soon this trend spread throughout the country. Other examples include heavy organic chemistry, rare element chemistry, and physical and chemical analysis, which no one studied before liberation, but now many units are conducting research in these areas.

　　Although chemical research has developed vigorously after liberation, there are still shortcomings. The biggest one is that most of the research (especially in institutions of higher education) is divorced from China's reality and does not play a role in socialist construction. Professors disdain to do research related to production, thinking that it has no creativity, and only theoretical research is considered scientific research. In the Double-Anti movement, the masses of Peking University criticized this idea. Subsequently, during the Great Leap Forward, the Party Committee of Peking University mobilized the masses to start doing research work related to production, some of which were scientific and technological projects urgently needed by the country, such as rare elements, special batteries, etc. The people participating in the research were all the teachers, students, and staff, and they completed more than 1,000 research topics in just forty-five days. Other schools had similar situations. After this leap forward, the research atmosphere changed dramatically. The connection between chemistry and production, and the combination of theory and practice, were finally realized.

　　Premier Zhou's report pointed out that future scientific research (including chemistry) should first serve production, while also paying attention to the development of cutting-edge science, and giving sufficient importance to basic scientific research. This is a very correct instruction, and I fully support it. In addition, I have a suggestion that we should have a comprehensive Chinese Chemical Abstracts journal, which briefly describes the research works in various fields of Chinese chemistry on a monthly basis. While participating in the compilation of "Ten Years of Chemistry in China," I found that most of China's chemical research papers are published in university journals and special publications of production departments, which I had not seen before. In these publications, some even lack complete sets in the library of the Academy of Sciences, and the libraries of universities and industrial departments have even more deficiencies. Compiling and printing comprehensive abstracts can have three functions: (1) good articles will not be ignored or missed; (2) certain research results can be quickly utilized; (3) it can avoid many repetitive studies, thereby saving manpower and material resources. However, the workload of establishing such a journal is considerable (if other sciences also do it), and a certain amount of manpower must be arranged by the leadership to carry it out.

　　In summary, under the leadership of the Party, science (including chemistry) education and research have embarked on a broad road with infinite bright and brilliant prospects.

　　党把化学教育提到最新最近代化的程度
    黄子卿委员的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。周总理的报告非常全面，它总结了第一个五年计划和一九五八年的伟大成就，提出一九五九年的经济任务，以及文化教育，国家政治生活和对外政策。我是个化学工作者，在北京大学化学系任教，只就化学教育和化学研究从第一个五年计划开始到现在的发展情形谈谈。我所谈的范围虽然狭窄，但内容是我自己知道比较准确的，因此可以算是切身的体会。
    首先我要谈化学教育发展情形。一九五二年在党的领导下全国高等学校进行院系调整。此时北京大学化学系有学生三百三十人，教师三十六人，一九五八年冬教师有一百六十四人，学生一千一百零二人，学生人数成为一九五二年的三点三倍，教师四点六倍，这是量的增加。在质的方面，一九五二年以前，只有教授才可以上堂讲课，讲师、助教只能担任指导实验。现在呢？北大化学系功课主要由讲、助们上堂讲授，包括基础课、专业和一些专门化课。例如我自己一九五二年以前所教的物理化学，化学热力学，统计化学，现在都由年轻讲师讲授，而且教得很好。这些功课从前都认为只有在国外“镀过金”的教师才能去教的，而青年教师都能胜任。从这个简单的例子，可以看出在国家正确教育方针和党的英明领导下，青年教师的成长，无论在量上或者质上，都具有空前的惊人速度。这是资本主义国家里的“教育家”不能梦见的成果。
    在课程方面我们化学系建立许多专门化，如高分子化学，稀有元素，仪器分析，同性素化学专门化（这都是我国以前没有的）和最近新建立的有机催化，电化学，半导体化学（后一个连资本主义国家都没有）专门化等等，这些专门化或者和国民经济有重要关系，或者是尖端科学，既有深入的理论，又能对国家建设起重大作用，完全合乎理论结合实际的要求。若没有党的领导和苏联专家的帮助，只靠原有几个教授，这些功课不知道要等到何年何月才能建立，其中有些可能永远不会建立，因为我们没有这样的专家。换一句话说，在短短的五年期间内，党把化学教育提高到最新最近代化的程度。其他高等学校的化学专业都有类似的发展，北京大学不过其中之一而已。
    在大跃进期间，北京大学化学系响应政府教育、劳动、生产三结合的号召，建立了十四个工厂（现在合并为五个厂）生产国家所需要的化学产品。随后，教师和学生又参加炼钢工作（广西、湖南、北京校区）。这就使他们接触化学的实际，真正做到学以致用的地步。更重要的是政治的收获，不少的资产阶级知识分子，通过实际劳动和接触工农，加速地转化为无产阶级知识分子，对社会主义建设起积极作用。例如过去培养出来的大学生，多数是脱离劳动人民的个人主义者。今日学生的思想、品质，远非昔日所能比拟。
    其次我想谈谈我国的化学研究。在反动统治时期，化学研究贫乏得可怜，只有极少数条件较好的研究所和高等学校能够进行一点研究。解放以后，中国科学院成立了几个化学研究所，高等学校普遍的增加设备和图书，生产单位也增设研究机构。化学研究渐成普遍现象，发表的论文日益增加。除几个全国性的化学刊物外，各高等学校和生产单位都刊行自己的学报和专刊。我最近参加编写十年来中国的化学，了解一些研究情况。化学部分分为十六类。在十年内这十六类的研究论文，最少的那一类也有四五十篇，最多的有五百多篇。其中之一类（例如最多的那类）的论文篇数就可以比上国民党二十年统治时期全部化学论文的篇数。由于仪器药品的增加，研究也做得比较深入，数据也较多，就质上来说，论文也比从前高得多。因此，党的领导对化学研究，无论在量上或在质上，都有空前的优越效果。
    更重要的是党领导化学界建立了和国民经济有重大关系的化学部门的研究。拿高分子化学来说，高分子产品，在工业、国防以及日常生活都有极大的重要性，而在解放前，国内就没有一个人专门做这样研究，学校里连这个功课都没有。在党的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，一九五二年起科学院开始进行高分子研究，不久这个风气就弥漫全国。又如重有机化学，稀有元素化学，物化分析等解放前都无人研究，现在已都有不少单位在进行。
    尽管化学研究在解放后有蓬勃的发展，但缺点还是存在的。最大的是多数的研究（特别是高等学校的）脱离中国实际，对社会主义建设不起作用。教授们不屑于做生产有关的研究，认为它没有创造性，只有理论研究才算是科学研究。在双反运动中北京大学的群众批判了这种思想。随后在大跃进时期北大党委发动群众开始做联系生产的研究工作，其中有些是国家急需的科学技术，例如稀有元素，特种电池等等。参加研究的人是全体师生员工，仅仅在四十五天内就完成了一千多项研究题目。别的学校也有类似情形。经过这次跃进，研究风气为之一变。化学联系生产，理论结合实际，最后得到实现。
    总理的报告指出，以后的科学研究（包括化学）首先服务生产，同时注意发展尖端科学，并给基础科学研究以足够的重视。这是非常正确的指示，我完全拥护。此外，我还有一个建议，我们应有一个全面性的中国化学撮要的期刊，按月把中国化学各方面的研究著作做简要的叙述。在参加编写十年来的中国化学时，我发现我国大部分的化学研究论文发表在大学学报和生产部门的专刊里，以前都没有看见。在这些刊物中，有些连科学院图书馆都没有全套，大学和产业部门的图书馆更多残缺。编印全面的撮要能起三个作用：（一）好文章不致被忽视或遗漏；（二）可以迅速地利用某些研究结果；（三）可以免掉许多重复性的研究，因而节省人力物力。但是建立这样刊物的工作量相当可观（如其他科学都做的话），必须由领导上安排一定的人力才能进行。
    总结起来，在党的领导下，科学（包括化学）教育和研究已走上康庄大道，有无限光明灿烂的前途。
