Since the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference began, many Western news agencies and newspapers have continuously reported that suspicions and divisions exist between the United States, France, West Germany, and Britain. The United States, France, and West Germany are reportedly trying to exert pressure on Britain, forcing it to yield. This blatant pressure has aroused resentment in Britain.

The differences among Western countries in their strategies for dealing with the Soviet proposals on West Berlin and a German peace treaty have long existed. At the time, these differences were mainly manifested in the different attitudes of the United States, France, and West Germany advocating "firmness," while Britain advocated "firmness" but with "flexibility." Later, after several twists and turns at the Western Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and due to the continuous pressure exerted by the United States and West Germany on Britain, as well as Britain's step-by-step retreat, an agreement was reluctantly reached in principle on the so-called "package plan" on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference.

Although Britain has been advocating the Western "package plan" together with the United States, West Germany, and France at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, when US Secretary of State Herter presented the so-called "package proposal" on behalf of the West at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, Reuters of Britain took the lead in publishing a version of another "package plan" that was not entirely the same as the one proposed by the United States. This version specifically mentioned certain British propositions, such as the need to discuss the Rapacki Plan. It was reported that this incident caused displeasure among US and West German officials, who considered it a "deliberate action" on the part of Britain. At the same time, many Western newspapers and news agencies also revealed that "Lloyd is prepared to extract the West Berlin issue from the Western package plan and negotiate with the Russians."

On the issue of a summit conference, a Reuters dispatch also said that there were "differences" in the views of the US and Britain. An American spokesman told reporters that if the current Foreign Ministers Conference failed, "then we would not expect to hold a summit conference." But Britain believes that "if the Foreign Ministers Conference fails, this fact itself is a reason to hold a summit meeting of heads of government."

This attitude of Britain has aroused great dissatisfaction from the United States, West Germany, and France. According to the Associated Press, "a fierce dispute occurred" among Western countries at that time. The "Paris Journal" correspondent in Geneva even said that "an anti-British movement" was launched in the side rooms of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference. "The instigators of this movement are Bonn and Paris." The newspaper even said that people suspect the British "are preparing to sell out the West." In Washington, at least "a dozen American newspapers" attacked Britain for "softening." A "Washington Star" reporter wrote: "British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's Western partners are anxiously and carefully reading every official statement made by Lloyd to see if there are any signs of 'softness'." The Associated Press believes that many of the current distrusts and suspicions in the West are "by-products of some developments after Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to Moscow in February and March this year."

Sources say that the US, France, and West Germany's pressure on Britain has greatly angered Britain. The "Daily Mail" reporter Wakefield reported that British figures in Geneva had denounced such tactics by "allies" as "shameful." The Conservative "Daily Telegraph" also published an editorial saying: "Now is the time to protest." The British delegation in Geneva is also "stewing with anger" at these pressures from "allies." According to UPI, the British delegation recently convened reporters in an "unusual" manner, emphasizing to them that Britain could not play an independent or mediating role during this conference. British Foreign Office officials also said: "Reports about rifts between Britain and our allies are seriously exaggerated." However, British spokesmen did not deny that there were differences of opinion between Britain, the United States, and West Germany on the issue of negotiating with the Soviet Union.

### 美法和西德对英国有猜疑  英国急忙解释说西方裂痕被夸大了

    美法和西德对英国有猜疑
    英国急忙解释说西方裂痕被夸大了
    本报讯　日内瓦外长会议召开以来，许多西方通讯社和报纸不断报道说：美、法、西德和英国之间存在着猜疑和分歧，美、法、西德竭力对英国施加压力，迫使英国屈服。这种粗暴的压力引起了英国的愤懑。
    西方国家在对付苏联的关于西柏林和对德和约建议的策略上的分歧，是早就存在了。当时这种分歧集中表现在美、法、西德主张“坚定”，而英国则主张“坚定”而“灵活”的不同态度上。之后，经过西方四外长会议的几番周折，由于美国、西德不断对英国施加压力以及英国的步步后退，在日内瓦外长会议前夕才勉强在原则上就所谓“一揽子计划”达成了协议。
  　尽管英国在日内瓦外长会议上一直同美国、西德和法国一起鼓吹西方的“一揽子计划”。但是当美国国务卿赫脱在日内瓦外长会议上代表西方提出所谓“一揽子建议”时，英国的路透社曾抢先发表了和美国提出的方案并不尽同的另一种“一揽子计划”的版本。这一版本特别提到某些英国方面的主张，如应该讨论腊帕茨基计划等。据报道，这一事件引起了美国和西德官员的不愉快，他们认为这是英国方面“有意的行动”。而与此同时，不少西方报刊和通讯社还透露，“劳埃德准备把西柏林问题从西方一揽子计划中抽出来同俄国人谈判”。
  　在最高级会议问题上，路透社的一则消息也说美英观点“有分歧”。一位美国发言人曾对记者说，如果目前的外长会议失败，“那末预料我们就不会举行最高级会议了”。而英国则认为，“如果外长会议失败，这一事实本身就是举行政府首脑会议的理由。”
    英国的这种态度引起了美国、西德、法国的极大不满。据美联社报道，当时在西方国家中曾“发生了一场激烈的争执”。法国“巴黎日报”驻日内瓦记者甚至说：在日内瓦外长会议的边房里“展开了一个反英运动”。“这个运动的指使者是波恩和巴黎方面”。这家报纸甚至说，人们在怀疑英国人“准备出卖西方”。而在华盛顿也至少有“一打的美国报纸”攻击英国“软化”。华盛顿“明星晚报”记者的报道说：“英国外交大臣劳埃德的西方伙伴们正在焦急地仔细阅读劳埃德的每一篇正式发言稿，看看有没有‘软’的迹象”。美联社认为西方目前的许多不信任和猜疑，是“麦克米伦首相今年2、3月间访问莫斯科以后一些情况发展的副产品”。
    有消息说，美、法、西德对英国施加压力的做法，使英国大为愤懑。伦敦“每日邮报”记者韦克福德报道，在日内瓦的英国人士曾把“盟国”的这种手段斥为“可耻的”。保守党的“每日电讯报”也发表社论说：“现在是提出抗议的时候了”。在日内瓦的英国代表团对于“盟国”这些压力也“蹩着一肚子气”。据合众国际社消息，英国代表团最近曾“异乎寻常地”召集记者们，向他们强调：英国在这次会议期间不可能扮演一个独立的或者调解人的角色。英国外交部人士也表示：“有关英国同我们的盟国有裂痕的消息，是严重地夸大。”但是，英国发言人并不否认英、美、西德在同苏联谈判的问题上存在着意见分歧。
