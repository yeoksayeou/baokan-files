　　Who Should Be Sympathized With
　　——Scenes from Lhasa After the Rebellion
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Gong Ce

　　Lhasa, this plateau city situated on the "Roof of the World" more than 3,600 meters above sea level, has become a place of global attention today. It is receiving all kinds of attention, with some people blessing it, while others, with crocodile tears, are "grieving" for it.

　　Since the suppression of the rebellion in Lhasa, you can see people busy in the streets of Lhasa working towards a new life. Some are vigorously clearing garbage, while others are planting vegetables. When you meet them in the morning, Tibetan old women nod to you, scattering white lime powder in front of their doors to signify "good fortune." Children like to be close to you and are willing to help you do this and that. In the suburbs of Lhasa, farmers tie auspicious red tassels to the horns of their cattle, carrying out spring plowing and planting.

　　People continue to live their religious lives as usual. On the streets, you can see old women sitting by their doors, "chanting sutras." In the Jokhang Temple, lamas continue to chant scriptures and prostrate themselves. A housewife told us that she had never interrupted her religious life at home since the Lhasa rebellion was quelled. Since the day the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, five-star red flags have been hanging on the buildings in the city. At the same time, you can also see colorful prayer flags symbolizing Buddhist life fluttering on the roofs of almost every household.

　　The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army once showed the greatest patience in dealing with the provocations of the rebels, and only when foreign-made machine guns and shells were taken from the rebels' armories and fired at the soldiers, and when the hope of peace was finally shattered, did the soldiers retaliate on orders. But even so, they made the greatest efforts and with a high degree of accuracy to avoid damaging buildings. Around the windows of the buildings where the rebels were concentrated, there were indeed bullet marks, but it was also in these places that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army captured the most prisoners. In the famous Gadan Namgyal Ling monastery, there were originally one hundred and nine lamas, but the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army eventually captured more than six hundred rebels from there; the rebel headquarters had once been located there. Buildings of institutions and enterprises such as the Lhasa Transportation Station of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Lhasa Municipal Construction Engineering Office suffered the greatest damage from the rebels. The rebels launched three attacks on the Lhasa Transportation Station with machine guns and mortars, but the militia organized by the drivers bravely repelled these attacks. Even institutions such as the Xinhua News Agency's Tibet Branch and the Tibet Daily were attacked by the rebels. Han and Tibetan editors and reporters held their ground in the courtyard of their editorial department for more than an hour. Bullets hit the rooms, and the rebels dug holes in the walls to attack the courtyard; a building was set on fire by the rebels. Later, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army arrived and defeated the rebels.

　　The people of Lhasa pray day and night for the happiness of their next life, but in this life, under the cruel rule of the upper-class reactionary group, they endured inhuman lives.

　　When you arrive at Damxung—a place one hundred and seventy kilometers from Lhasa—you can see that the local Tibetans are all wearing very ragged clothes. Later, it was learned that Damxung is one of the most fertile pastures in Tibet, but the people there are so impoverished because they are subjected to cruel exploitation. Perhaps the conditions in the countryside are difficult, but Lhasa should not be so. In fact, when you arrive in Lhasa, the impression you get is that the ordinary residents here are also equally poor. You can see many slums in the city, where the so-called "untouchables" live. By the dilapidated tents, filth is everywhere. They are barefoot, disheveled, and wear very dirty and ragged clothes. When you approach the tents, the scene of poverty and rags is simply heartbreaking to see.

　　However, the people of Lhasa tell us that the current situation is much better than before liberation. In the eight years since the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, despite all kinds of obstacles, they have still tried their best to do many good things for the people. A lama from Drepung Monastery told us that the People's Liberation Army has established farms, enabling them to eat green vegetables. The People's Hospital provides them with free treatment. After the road was opened, he no longer needed to trek long distances when he went home. After the rebellion was quelled, some poor people and serfs received relief from the Military Control Commission, and those with labor skills began to find employment.

　　The reactionary former local government of Tibet did not do a single good thing for the broad masses of working people here in the eight years since liberation. On the contrary, when the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army provided relief to the masses and distributed agricultural loans, the reactionary elements often pocketed the grain that had been distributed. Even more barbaric was that the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet had always preserved a method of rule that was even more cruel than in medieval Europe. The sixteen articles of criminal law used by the former local government of Tibet to rule the people were things from a thousand years ago, and they were still in use until the rebellion was quelled. The People's Liberation Army seized a large number of instruments of torture used by the former local government of Tibet and the upper-class reactionary group during the suppression of the rebellion, including various instruments of torture such as gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, and dissecting the abdomen to extract the heart. One type of instrument for gouging out eyes was a stone ring made of stone. When used, it was placed on the victim's head, and then the top of the head was struck with a hammer, causing the eyeballs to protrude. Finally, the eyeballs were gouged out with something like an iron hook, which was extremely cruel.

　　For people living in the 1950s, the term "fetters," apart from seeing its shape on the neck of the pitiful female prisoner in the Peking Opera "Yu Tang Chun," has almost become an abstract concept in people's minds. However, in Lhasa, it is not rare. Many wooden yokes and shackles have now been found here, and their cruelty far exceeds the kind depicted in historical dramas. One type of wooden shackle was made from a tree trunk more than ten feet long and weighing hundreds of pounds. The trunk was sawn in half, and holes were dug in the middle that were as thick as a person's calf. Five victims used one "tree trunk shackle," and their ten legs were placed in that heavy wood, making it impossible for them to move. During the day, the five people stood together, and at night they used force to turn the tree trunk and lie down together on the damp ground to sleep. This bizarre form of torture is truly unheard of. Even more cruel was a wooden cage used to imprison people. The victim stood in the cage, with his head outside the cage, with no room to move. Then, he had to wear a thirty-pound stone hat on his head. After such barbaric treatment, the victim was mostly crushed to death by the stone hat within a day or two. Now, these inhumane instruments of torture have mostly been collected by the people's judicial organs of Tibet as living witnesses to the cruel rule of the upper-class reactionary group. We saw there that the inner layer of the stone ring used to gouge out eyes had been polished smooth.

　　After the rebellion was quelled, a work team sent by the Military Control Commission to the northern district of Lhasa found that in a residents' group with dozens of households, they could not even elect a healthy person to be the group leader, because the adult residents of that group were all disabled with missing legs or blind eyes. Many of them were disabled by the reactionary government and nobles. In the streets of Lhasa, various disabled people can be found at any time.

　　We also visited Gadan Namgyal Ling monastery, where we saw a court specially set up in the monastery to interrogate women. It was gloomy and terrifying inside, filled with rows of instruments of torture and ropes. Various terrifying images were arranged in the middle of the house and by the walls. When we visited, a woman's arm that had been cut off and dried was still hanging on the wall on the right. The fingers of that hand were slender, and the fingernails were white, which was shocking to see. Do not forget that this was a private court set up in a monastery where scriptures were chanted, which was considered a matter of course in the past. Not only that, but it was also required as a sacred system that would "never change," ready to be passed on to future generations.

　　The people of Lhasa also talked about such a terrible situation: there are two scorpion caves in Tibet, one in the Shannan area and one under the Potala Palace. The scorpion cave in Shannan is said to be a thousand years old. This scorpion cave is specially used to punish "criminals." The bottom of the cave is dark, and scorpions are everywhere. When the victims are thrown down into the cave, they are quickly stung to death by the hungry and terrifying poisonous scorpions. After the rebellion was quelled, comrades from the Military Control Commission's work team found the scorpion cave under the Potala Palace. Because the weather began to warm up, the work team had already caught some scorpions in the cave.

　　All friends in the world with truly charitable hearts, how should you express your sympathy when faced with these shocking facts?

　　The upper-class reactionary group in Tibet turned this place into a living hell under their rule, but today, their crimes have been revealed to the world. We want to bless our dear Tibetan compatriots for their new life, and cheer for them to obtain a paradise in this life. (Photo attached)

### 谁应当受到同情——平叛后的拉萨见闻

　　谁应当受到同情
　　——平叛后的拉萨见闻
　　新华社记者　宫策
    拉萨，这个座落在拔海三千六百多公尺“世界屋脊”上的高原城市，今天成了世界注目的地方。她承受着各种各样的关注，有的人为她祝福，有的人却怀着“猫哭耗子”的心肠为她“悲伤”。
    拉萨叛乱平息以后，在拉萨街头，你可以看到人们为新的生活而忙碌。有的在大力清除垃圾，有的在播种蔬菜。在清晨相遇的时候，藏族老婆婆们向你点头示意，她们把白灰粉撒在门前，表示“吉祥如意”。孩子们很喜欢亲近你，愿意帮助你做这样那样事情。在拉萨市郊，农民们把表示吉祥的红缨缚在牛角上，进行春耕春种。
    人们照样过着他们的宗教生活。在街头，随时可以看到一些老婆婆坐在门边“念转经”。在大昭寺，喇嘛们照样在念经磕头。一个家庭妇女告诉我们说，从叛乱平息以来，她在家里从没有间断过自己的宗教生活。自从拉萨叛乱平息那天起，市内的建筑物上一直悬挂着五星红旗。同时，你也可以看到几乎是家家户户的屋顶上，都飘扬着各色各样的象征佛教生活的旗幡。
    人民解放军的战士们曾经以最大的忍耐对待叛匪的挑衅，只是在从叛匪枪械库里搬出外国造的机枪和炮弹打到战士们头上的时候，在和平的希望最后破灭了的时候，战士们才奉命还击。但是即使如此，他们还是尽了最大的努力和以高度的准确性，来避免损坏建筑物。在叛匪集中的建筑物内，窗户口的周围的确留下了弹痕，然而也正是在这些地方，解放军战士们抓到的俘虏最多。在功德林那个有名的寺庙里，本来有一百零九个喇嘛，可是解放军战士最后从那里俘掳了六百多名叛乱分子，叛匪司令部就曾经设在那里。青藏公路拉萨运输站和拉萨市建筑工程处等机关企业的建筑物却受到了叛匪最大的破坏。叛匪曾用机枪和迫击炮向拉萨运输站发动了三次进攻，但是由驾驶员组织起来的机关民兵，英勇地打退了这些进攻。连新华社西藏分社和西藏日报社这样一些机关，也都遭到了叛匪的进攻。汉族和藏族的编辑、记者们曾经在他们编辑部的院子里坚守了一个多小时，枪弹打进室内，叛乱分子挖墙洞攻进院里，一座楼房被叛匪放火烧毁。后来解放军战士赶到，才把叛匪击溃。
    拉萨人日日夜夜为他们来生的幸福而祈祷，可是他们生前在上层反动集团的残酷统治下忍受着非人的生活。
    当你到了当雄——这个离拉萨一百七十公里地方的时候，可以看到当地藏胞都穿着非常褴褛的衣服。后来据了解，当雄一带还是西藏地区最肥美的牧场之一，可是那里的人民因为受到残酷的剥削，竟是那样的贫困。或许乡下的条件困难，而拉萨总不会如此。其实不然，到了拉萨，给人的印象是这里的普通居民也都同样贫困。你可以在市区内看到很多贫民窟，那里聚居着所谓“贱民”。在破烂不堪的帐棚边，污物狼借，他们赤脚、蓬头，身上都穿着非常肮脏破烂的衣服。当你走近帐篷的时候，那种贫困褴褛的景象，简直令人看了痛心。
    但是，拉萨人告诉我们，其实现在的情况比解放前好多了，解放军进藏八年来，虽然遭受种种阻挠，他们还是努力给人民办了很多好事。哲蚌寺的一个喇嘛对我们说，解放军办了农场，使他们吃上了青菜，人民医院为他们免费治疗，公路修通以后，他回家时再也不需要艰难地远途跋涉了。叛乱平息以后，一些贫民和农奴得到了军管会的救济，有劳动技能的还开始得到了就业。
    反动的原西藏地方政府，在解放八年来，没有为这里的广大劳动人民做一点好事，相反地，当中共西藏工委和解放军西藏军区给予群众救济和发放农贷的时候，常常是前面发了种粮，反动分子在后面便收进了自己的腰包里。更野蛮的是，西藏上层反动集团还一直保存了比欧洲中世纪还要残酷的统治方法。原西藏地方政府统治人民的十六条刑典，是一千年以前的东西，直到叛乱平息以前还在用。解放军在平叛中缴获了大批原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所用的刑具，其中有挖眼睛、割鼻子、剖腹挖心等各种刑具。有一种挖眼睛的刑具，是用石头凿成的石圈，使用时把它套在受害者的头上，然后用锤打击头顶，眼珠即突出，最后用铁钩之类的东西将眼珠挖出，真是残酷之极。
    生活在二十世纪五十年代的人们，对于“枷锁”这个名词，除了在京戏“玉堂春”中在那个可怜的女囚脖子上看到它的形状以外，它在人们的脑子中几乎已成为一个抽象的概念了。可是，在拉萨却不稀罕。现在这里已经搜出了很多木枷、木镣，而其残酷性远远超过了历史剧中所描绘的那种情况。有一种木镣是用一棵一丈多长的几百斤重的树杆做成的，树杆被锯成两半，中间挖成可容人的小腿那样粗的孔，受害者五人使用一棵“树杆镣”，他们十条腿套进那个沉重的木头里，根本不能走动，白天五人一起站着，夜晚则用力转动一下树杆，一起躺倒在潮湿的地上睡眠。这种离奇的刑法真是闻所未闻。更残酷的是有一种囚人用的木笼，受害者站在笼中，头在笼外，毫无活动的余地，然后，头上还要戴三十斤重的石帽，经过这样野蛮的处置，受害者大都在一两天之内便被石帽压死了。现在，这些惨无人道的刑具，大都已作为上层反动集团残酷统治的活见证，由西藏的人民司法机关收集起来。我们在那里看到，那个用以挖眼睛的石圈，里层已经被磨得光滑滑的了。
    平叛以后，军管会派在拉萨市北区的一个工作队，发现在一个有几十户的居民小组里，竟然选不出一个健康的人当组长，因为那个小组的成年居民，全是缺腿瞎眼的残废者。他们当中很多是被反动政府和贵族折磨成残废的。在拉萨市街头，随时可以发现各种各样的残废的人。
    我们还参观了功德林，在那里，看到了寺庙里设置的一个专门审讯妇女的法庭。那里面阴森可怕，布满了成排的刑具和绳索，房子的中间和墙边排列了各种面貌可怕的凶像。到我们参观时，在右面的墙壁上还挂着一只被割下来已经风干了的女人的手臂，那只手的手指细长，指甲呈白色，视之令人发指。不要忘记，这是在念经的寺庙里私设的公堂，过去被认为是理所当然的事，不仅如此，而且被要求作为“永远不改”的神圣制度，准备永传后世。
    拉萨人还谈到这样一个可怕的情况：在西藏有两个蝎子洞，一个在山南地区，一个在布达拉宫下。山南的那个蝎子洞据说已有一千年的历史。这个蝎子洞是专门用来惩罚“犯人”的，洞下阴暗，蝎子丛生，当受害者被丢到洞下的时候，他们很快便会被饥饿可怕的毒蝎活活螫死。叛乱平息以后，军管会工作组的同志在布达拉宫下找到了那个蝎子洞，因为气候开始转暖，工作组已经在洞中捉到了一些蝎子。
    世界上所有具有真正慈善心肠的朋友们，你们面对这些触目惊心的事实，该怎样来表示你们的同情呢？
    西藏上层反动集团把这里变成了他们统治下的人间地狱，但是，今天，他们的罪行已大白于天下。我们要为亲爱的西藏同胞们获得新生而祝福，为他们在生前就要得到一个极乐世界而欢呼。（附图片）
