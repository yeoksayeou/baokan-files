Xinhua News Agency, 10th – German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Wang Guozhang, hosted a banquet tonight for the visit of the People's Chamber delegation of the German Democratic Republic to China.

Chairman Zhu De said at the banquet that the Soviet government's recent proposals to conclude peace treaties with the two Germanys and end the occupation regime in West Berlin are of extremely great significance for easing international tensions and eliminating the threat of war. The Chinese people fully support these proposals of the Soviet government. We hope that the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Geneva tomorrow and the subsequent summit meeting will help resolve the issues of the German peace treaty and West Berlin.

At the beginning of the banquet, Ambassador Wang Guozhang spoke first, congratulating the People's Chamber delegation of the German Democratic Republic on the success of their visit of peace and friendship to China, and extended a warm welcome to the guests attending the banquet.

Chairman Dieckmann spoke at the banquet, saying that our delegation has visited India, Ceylon, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic, and finally arrived in the People's Republic of China. We have held talks with the leaders and politicians of these countries, and have had contact with a wide range of parliamentarians and politicians. We are convinced that these visits have deepened our existing friendship with these countries and promoted new friendships; not only have we strengthened friendship with socialist brother countries, but also with the people of India and Ceylon. Chairman Dieckmann said that we have been warmly received everywhere in these countries, and I believe this is of great significance for the Geneva conference to be held tomorrow. These visits are the best proof of our friendly policy towards the people of all countries. Such visits have received a resounding response in various countries.

Chairman Dieckmann said that the German Democratic Republic, as the first worker-peasant state in German history, will do its best to contribute to the cause of peace.

Chairman Zhu De then spoke, saying that the unremitting efforts of the German people to safeguard European and world peace and to promote the peaceful reunification of their country have been warmly praised and supported by the Chinese people and the people of the world. We are deeply convinced that the noble aspiration of the German people to strive for the peaceful reunification of their country will be fully realized with the support of the people of the world.

Chairman Zhu De said that in a short period of time, the comrades of the delegation celebrated the "May Day" International Labor Day with us, visited some industrial cities in our country, visited our industrial construction, agricultural production and people's communes, and had extensive contacts and conversations with workers, peasants and people from all walks of life in our country, and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere. During the visit, the delegation brought the fighting friendship of the German people to the Chinese people, which is a great encouragement to the Chinese people who are striving to realize the 1959 socialist construction plan. Chairman Zhu De also said that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is about to open tomorrow, and the Chinese people are pleased to see that the German Democratic Republic has also sent a government delegation to participate in this conference.

In their speeches, Chairman Dieckmann and Chairman Zhu De proposed toasts to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, to the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to world peace.
