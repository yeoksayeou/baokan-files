    Beware of Falling into a Trap
    Prime Minister Nehru's speech on April 27th was greatly applauded by British and American imperialists. A very conservative British newspaper, the "News Chronicle," praised the speech as a "sublime" "example" and said that it "enhanced Nehru's stature as a politician and diplomat." The Republican "New York Herald Tribune" in the United States was even more ecstatic, writing: "A wave of anger against Peking has suddenly swept across Asia. If Nehru is moving with this wave, no matter how subtly, it is big news."
    If people are not too forgetful, they will recall that around the time Nehru met with the Dalai Lama on April 24th and made a statement to reporters, or after his speech to the Indian People's House on April 2nd, which was also full of malice and distortion but still relatively veiled, the tone of many British and American newspapers was exactly the opposite. They criticized and satirized Nehru's speech as "ambiguous," "cowardly," and "the worst appeasement policy."
    Time passes quickly, and the tune changes quickly too. From initial condemnation to later flattery, why is the change so significant? Is it because Prime Minister Nehru has further clarified the fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted? Is it because Prime Minister Nehru has expressed further concern for Sino-Indian friendly relations? Or is it because Prime Minister Nehru has issued necessary condemnation of imperialist and expansionist elements interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining the principles of peaceful coexistence? If not for these reasons, then the applause of the imperialists is worth deep vigilance!
    There is a Chinese saying: If the enemy scolds us, it proves that we have done good deeds; if the enemy likes us, it proves that we have done bad deeds. I don't know if India has a similar saying. However, Prime Minister Nehru wrote in his book "The Discovery of India": "I want to get as far away from Britain as possible," and he gave a whole paragraph of explanation, saying that this did not refer to the British people. Prime Minister Nehru indeed stated a truth here: we should stay as far away from the enemy as possible. But today, British imperialists, and even more ferocious American imperialists, are showing such intimacy with our Indian friends. Why is this? Whether they are closer to Prime Minister Nehru, or Prime Minister Nehru is closer to them, it seems that it is basically the same. Isn't such a thing also worth deep vigilance?
    It should be pointed out that the imperialists have actually cast their bait long ago. Former US President Truman had already revealed his true colors. He once expressed "surprise" at Prime Minister Nehru's "unawareness of the folly of his neutralism," and the New York "Daily Mirror" also bluntly stated: India is asking for trouble by pursuing neutralism. What a compassionate and benevolent face! However, every true politician and diplomat can easily hear the voice of the devil. From "folly" to "cowardly" to "sublime," there is an invisible red line in the middle of this series of terms. One end of this red line is anti-China and anti-communism, and the other end is abandoning neutrality. Isn't this very obvious?
    We advise our Indian friends: Beware of falling into a trap!

### 当心落入陷阱

    当心落入陷阱
    尼赫鲁总理4月27日的讲话，受到了英美帝国主义分子的大大喝彩。英国的一家十分保守的“新闻纪事报”，推崇这个讲话是“崇高”的“范例”，并且使尼赫鲁“增强了作为一位政治家和外交家的身份”。美国共和党的“纽约先驱论坛报”更是欢喜若狂地写道：“整个亚洲突然掀起了一股反对北平的愤怒的浪潮。如果说尼赫鲁在随着这一浪潮前进，不论是在多么细微的程度上，那都是一则大消息。”
    人们假若还不健忘的话，就可以发现当4月24日尼赫鲁会见达赖喇嘛后向记者发表谈话的前后，或者是4月2日他在印度人民院发表的虽然也充满了恶意和歪曲但还比较隐晦的谈话以后，英美很多报刊的论调却恰恰与此相反，它们批评、讽刺尼赫鲁的讲话是
  “态度含糊”，是“懦弱”，是“最坏的姑息政策”。
    时间过得很快，调子变得也很快。前踞而后恭，变化为什么这样显著呢？是尼赫鲁总理对达赖被劫持的事实有了进一步的澄清吗？是尼赫鲁总理对中印友好关系表示了进一步的关怀吗？或者是尼赫鲁总理对帝国主义和扩张主义分子干涉中国内政、破坏和平共处原则有了必要的谴责吗？如果不是这些方面的原因，那吗，帝国主义分子的喝彩，就值得深深警惕了！
    中国有一句俗话：敌人骂我们，正说明我们作了好事；敌人喜欢我们，正说明了我们作了坏事。不知道印度是否也有类似的语言。但是，尼赫鲁总理在他的“印度的发现”那本书里曾经写道：“我要离开英国越远越好”，他并且作了整段的解释，说这不是指的英国人民。尼赫鲁总理在这里的确说明了一个真理：我们离开敌人越远越好。可是，今天，英国帝国主义者，并且加上比英国更凶恶的美国帝国主义分子，他们都同我们的印度朋友表现得如此亲密，这又是为什么呢？无论是他们离尼赫鲁总理近了，或者是尼赫鲁总理离他们近了，看来，基本上都是一样的。这样的事情，不是也值得深深警惕吗？
    应该指出，帝国主义者其实早就撒下了钓饵。前美国总统杜鲁门早已经露了底。他曾经对尼赫鲁总理的“意识不到他的中立主义的愚蠢”表示过“奇怪”，纽约“每日镜报”，也曾露骨地说道：印度执行中立主义是自讨苦吃。好一副悲天悯人、大慈大悲的面孔啊！但是，每一个真正的政治家和外交家，都不难听出魔鬼的心声。从“愚蠢”到“懦弱”再到“崇高”，这一连串的名词中间是有一根无形的红线的。这根红线的一端是反华反共，一端是放弃中立。这难道不是很明显的事吗？
    奉劝印度的朋友们：当心落入陷阱！
