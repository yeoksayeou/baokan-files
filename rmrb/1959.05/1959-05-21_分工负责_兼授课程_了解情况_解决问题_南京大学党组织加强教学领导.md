    Divided Responsibilities, Concurrent Teaching, Understanding the Situation, Solving Problems
    Nanjing University Party Organization Strengthens Leadership in Teaching

    (Our report) The Party organizations at all levels of Nanjing University are actively strengthening their leadership over teaching work.

    In the in-depth work of grasping teaching at Nanjing University, each member of the Standing Committee implemented a fixed division of responsibilities, with each member in charge of one or two departments. The Standing Committee members frequently listen to work reports from the departments, have individual conversations with cadres in the departments, understand the situation, and check the teaching of teachers. The Standing Committee member in charge of the Foreign Languages Department, when understanding the teaching situation in this department, discovered that some teachers were not bold enough in their lectures and did not have strict enough requirements for students. They immediately raised this issue with the Party General Branch and assisted the department leaders in solving this problem. When Party Secretary Guo Yingqiu was checking students' notes on economic geography in the Geography Department, he found that the notes mentioned a copper smelter in Sichuan that used ore transported from a distant location. He immediately pointed out that this example was inconsistent with the facts because Sichuan did not have this copper smelter. The teacher who gave the lecture, after careful inspection, discovered that he had not carefully verified the facts when quoting other people's materials.

    The Party committee members also frequently go down to lower levels to provide guidance and assistance to teaching work. The Geography Department originally planned to compile eleven textbooks, but felt that the strength was not enough and there were many difficulties. After Guo Yingqiu and the department leading comrades jointly studied, they decided to concentrate their efforts on compiling four to five textbooks first. The Secretary of the Department General Branch reflected that there was a lot of work and heavy tasks in the department. After the leadership helped analyze, they clarified the key points and had a clue. No matter how much work there is, it is easy to grasp. The Mathematics and Astronomy Department had once transferred teachers from the geometry and algebra teaching and research groups to the applied mathematics teaching and research group. Lu Zimin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, believed that this practice weakened the teaching and research of basic mathematics and would affect the implementation of the principle of "walking on two legs, basic mathematics and applied mathematics." After he raised this issue with the department, the department is now reallocating teachers to strengthen the strength of the basic mathematics teaching and research group.

    The secretaries and members of the general branches of each department frequently participate in teaching and research group meetings, attend lectures, and participate in student learning discussions. Before teaching assistant Liu Yu of the History Department lectured on "The First International and the Paris Commune," the teaching and research group organized a trial lecture. The Secretary of the General Branch and two members listened to the trial lecture and discussion and put forward many suggestions for improvement, which greatly inspired Comrade Liu Yu. The General Branch of the Chinese Department learned that some students had opinions on the lectures in the modern works selection course. After the Secretary of the General Branch and the teaching and research group went to listen to the lectures together, after discussion, they believed that the teachers did not lecture according to the actual level of the students. After the teacher improved, the students' opinions were greatly reduced. Among the new students received by the Foreign Languages Department last year, nearly 70% were worker-peasant students who graduated from worker-peasant quick-completion middle schools. They felt very difficult in foreign language learning. The Department General Branch often held student representative symposiums, learning method exchange meetings, and worker-peasant student learning research conferences to solve the problems in a timely manner. The General Branch also conveyed the students' requirements and opinions to the teachers, and mobilized the teachers to strengthen assistance to the worker-peasant students. Now many teachers regard teaching worker-peasant students well as a glorious task and include it in their personal red and expert plans, and often go to the student dormitory in the evening for individual tutoring. Under the leadership of the General Branch, through the joint efforts of teachers and students, the academic performance of worker-peasant students has mostly reached excellent levels.

    The Party committee and general branches also undertook the teaching of philosophy and the political course of "Socialism and Communism." Two members of the Standing Committee have already started classes in their respective departments, and other members of the Standing Committee will also start classes one after another. The secretaries and propaganda committee members of the general branches of each department have all started classes in their own departments. In addition to political courses, some people also undertake business course teaching. Yu Minghuang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee, lectured on "Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Thought," and Mao Jiaqi, a member of the General Branch of the History Department, lectured on the first half of the "Modern History of China" course, both of which were welcomed by the students. Party secretaries and committee members participating in lectures can not only directly conduct ideological education for students in the teaching process, but also can go deeper into teaching and better lead teaching by collecting reflections before class and participating in student discussions after class.

    Now, the Party organization of Nanjing University is preparing to further delve into teaching and strengthen its leadership in teaching while strengthening leadership in political thought. (Bao Chunguang)

    分工负责　兼授课程　了解情况　解决问题
    南京大学党组织加强教学领导
    本报讯　南京大学各级党组织积极加强对教学工作的领导。
    南大党委在深入抓教学的工作中，各个常委实行了固定的分工负责办法，每个常委都分别掌握一到两个系。常委经常听取系的工作汇报，和系里的干部个别交谈，了解情况、检查教师的教学情况。分工掌握外文系的常委在这个系了解教学情况时，发现个别教师讲课不够大胆，对学生要求不够严格，随即向党总支提出，并协助系领导解决这一问题。党委书记郭影秋同志在地理系检查学生学习经济地理的笔记时，发现笔记中提到四川有个炼铜厂用的矿石是从较远的某地运去的，他即指出这个例子和事实有出入，四川没有这个炼铜厂。讲课的教师经过仔细检查，发现原来是自己在引用别人的材料时，没有认真核对事实。
    党委们还经常深入下去，对教学工作进行指导和帮助。地理系原订编写十一门教材，但感到力量不够，困难很多。郭影秋同志和系领导同志共同研究后，决定集中力量首先编写四至五门教材。系总支书记反映说：系里工作多，任务重，经过领导帮助分析，就明确了重点，有了头绪，工作再多也好抓了。数学天文系曾经将几何、代数教研组的教师抽调到应用数学教研组去。党委副书记陆子敏认为他们这种做法削弱了基础数学的教学研究，将会影响“基础数学和应用数学两条腿走路”的原则的贯彻。他向系里提出这个问题以后，现在这个系正在重新调配教师，加强基础数学教研组的力量。
    各个系的总支书记和委员们都经常参加教研组会议、参加听课和参加学生学习讨论会，历史系助教刘瑜在讲“第一国际和巴黎公社”前，教研组组织了试讲。总支书记和两个委员都听了试讲和讨论，提出了很多改进意见，给刘瑜同志很大启发。中文系总支了解到有些学生对现代作品选读课程讲课有意见，总支书记和教研组一块去听课后，经过讨论，认为教师没有根据学生的实际水平讲课。这位教师经过改进以后，学生的意见就大大减少。外文系去年接收的新生中，有将近70％是工农速成中学毕业的工农学生。他们对外文学习感到很困难。系总支常常召开学生代表座谈会、学习方法交流会和工农学生学习研究会等，及时解决了问题。总支还把学生的要求、意见转达给教师，动员教师对工农学生加强帮助。现在许多教师都把教好工农学生当作光荣任务而订在个人红专规划里，晚上还常常到学生宿舍去个别辅导。在总支领导下，经过教师与学生的共同努力，工农学生的学习成绩大部分达到了优良的水平。
    党委和总支还担任了哲学和“社会主义与共产主义”政治课的讲授。两个常委已分别在自己分工的系里开了课，其它常委也将陆续开课。各个系的总支书记和宣传委员，都在自己系里开了课。除了政治课以外，有些人还担任业务课教学。党委常委俞铭璜同志讲授“毛泽东文艺思想”，历史系总支委员茅家琦同志讲授上半部“中国近代史”的课程，都受到了学生的欢迎。党的书记和委员们参加讲课，不仅可以在教学过程中直接对学生进行思想教育，并且可以通过课前搜集反映、课后参加学生讨论而更加深入教学，更好地领导教学。
    现在，南京大学的党组织，准备进一步深入教学，在加强对于政治思想领导的同时，大力加强对于教学的领导。　（鲍春光）
