Suggestions for Reforming the Summer Harvest Methods
Liu Qing

Farmers all know that the wheat harvest season is the most intense time for labor. There are many sayings that express this level of intensity, such as "snatching food from the dragon's mouth," "embroidered maidens leaving their beds," and being so busy that you can only gulp down water from a jar, and so on.

This year's wheat harvest task is even more arduous. Because of deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization, the wheat is growing particularly densely; there are far more high-yield fields than in previous years.

Of course, tool reform is an important way to improve labor productivity. This applies not only to the summer harvest, but to all agricultural activities. However, it should not be thought that tool reform is the only way, and that there is no need to think of other methods.

Some places in Wangqu Commune in Chang'an County have established production points in the fields, that is: placing the feeding rooms, grain threshing yards, and granaries in the center of the cultivated area outside the village, in order to save labor and reduce the heavy labor of transporting crops to the village and transporting manure to the fields.

However, most places have not done this. Some production teams complain about a lack of labor and materials, and some production teams simply do not want to do it. You don't have to force them to do this. Let them see the benefits that the production teams that have done it have received, and they will know that doing it that way is good. Changing the position of the furniture in a house can lead to different ideas among family members, let alone reforming a production method?

Even so, I think it would be a good idea to put the threshing ground in the center of the cultivated area, and then transport the wheat grains and wheat straw back to the village leisurely after threshing, right? It only requires setting up a threshing ground and a temporary shed in the field.

If doing so is temporarily ideologically unacceptable, then would it not be better to first pad a slightly higher work platform in the field, about a foot above the ground, pile the wheat straw there first, and then transport it to the village at a more leisurely pace? Wouldn't this also allow us to concentrate our efforts on harvesting? Wouldn't it avoid grain losses that could be caused by wind and rain? Wouldn't it allow us to quickly focus our efforts on summer planting?

I hope not to repeat the distressing losses of the 1956 summer harvest. You must know that the fruits of our Great Leap Forward cannot be ruined on the land because some people stubbornly adhere to outdated habits! Sprouted wheat doesn't taste very good! We are large-scale production in the era of communes, not individual farming, where we have to transport a bundle of wheat home before we can feel at ease after cutting it down.

I hope that commune cadres and commune members will consider this view. Some people who imposed their subjective ideas on the production team for a period of time, not allowing the masses to discuss, say in another period: nothing can be done, let the masses do whatever they want. I absolutely do not sympathize with such cadres. They often do not treat our cause with a very serious, conscientious, and responsible attitude! At any time, any new thing must be done with the masses, explaining the principles clearly, in order to work. Coercion and laissez-faire are both wrong. Dear comrades!

    建议改革夏收办法
    柳青
    庄稼人都知道麦收时节劳动最紧张。有许多话，都是表现这种紧张程度的，如“龙口夺食”啦，“绣女下床”啦，忙得端起罐子喝水哩，等等。
    今年的麦收任务更加繁重。因为深翻地、密植和肥料大，麦子长的特别厚；丰产田比往年多得多。
    当然，工具改革是提高劳动生产率的重要途径。不仅夏收，对一切农事，都是这样。但是并不能认为工具改革是唯一的途径，除此以外，不必想别的办法。
    长安县王曲公社有些地方在田间建立了生产点，即：把饲养室、打粮食的场和粮仓，都放在村外耕作区的中心，这样来节省劳力，减轻了把田禾运到村里和把粪运到地里的繁重劳动。
    但是大部分地方没有这样做，有些生产队喊叫没劳力，没材料，有些生产队根本不愿这样做。对这，可以不必勉强。要他们看看做了的生产队得到了好处，他们就知道那样做好啦。把屋子里的摆设改变一下位置，家庭成员之间还有不同的想法，何况改革一种生产方法呢？
    虽然这样，我想，把场放在耕作区的中心，打毕场再把麦粒和麦秸分别从容不迫地运回村，该是个好主意吧？仅仅需要去田间盘一个场，扎一个临时棚就行了。
    要是这样做，思想上暂时也搞不通的话，那么在地里先垫个高一点的工台，比地面高出一尺，把麦秸子先埒在地里，然后从容一点往村里运，不好吗？这样，不是也可以把力量集中用在收割上吗？不是可以避免风雨可能造成的粮食损失吗？不是可以很快把力量用在夏播上吗？
    我希望不重复1956年夏收时令人心疼的损失。要知道，我们跃进的果实，不能因为一部分人固执地坚持落后习惯而糟蹋在土地上呀！出芽麦很不好吃呀！我们是公社时代的大生产，不是单干，割倒一捆麦子，也要运到家里才放心。
    我希望公社干部和公社社员考虑这个看法。有些在一个时期内把自己主观的一套强加于生产队，不容群众商量的人，在另外一个时期，他们说：什么也不能搞了，群众爱怎样就怎样好了。我绝不同情这样的干部。他们常常不是用很严肃、认真、负责的态度，对待我们的事业！任何时候，任何新事物，必须对群众做工作，讲清道理，才能行得通，强迫和放任都是不对的。亲爱的同志们！
