    “Three-Way Combination” is a “Treasure”
    Liu Zhiyuan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Anshan Iron and Steel Dong Anshan Iron Mine Committee
    Gao Yang, Director of Anshan Iron and Steel Dong Anshan Iron Mine
    Anshan Iron and Steel Dong Anshan Iron Mine is a modern integrated enterprise for black metallurgy raw materials. It extracts red lean iron ore with an iron content of about 32%, crushes it, and then floats it into a concentrate powder with an iron content of more than 60%, which is then sintered and sent to ironmaking. According to the plan, the sintered ore raw materials produced by the mine this year can be smelted into more than one million tons of high-quality steel after being smelted in blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. However, since it was officially put into production in October last year, it has long failed to produce qualified concentrates; the sintering workshop requires dry concentrates, while the concentrates filtered by the flotation workshop's filters have high moisture content and low output. Failure to solve this problem quickly will not only affect the normal production of the mining, crushing, and sintering processes, but also affect the over-fulfillment of Anshan Iron and Steel and the national steel production tasks. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee and the specific guidance of the working group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, we mobilized all the mine's employees from November last year to carry out a technological revolution using the "three-way combination" method of leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel, and innovated equipment, operating methods, and technological procedures. Finally, we broke through the key to production, and the moisture content of the concentrate dropped from about 15% to about 12%, and the output increased from more than 1,000 tons to more than 5,000 tons. The achievement of this production result not only increased our confidence in leaping towards higher production goals, but also made us deeply understand the great significance of implementing the "three-way combination."
    Several months of experience have told us that the close combination of leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel is an important guarantee for fully relying on the working class to run enterprises well, and it is also an effective method for carrying out the technological revolution and technological innovation movement in a deep and widespread manner. Because we have initially implemented the "three-way combination" in the past period of work, we have achieved great results in the relationship between leaders and the masses, in the unity of theory and practice, in the combination of the Party's political and ideological work and production and technical work, and in the combination of soaring energy and scientific analysis. We have not only broken through the key to production and ensured the continuous improvement of production levels, but also effectively improved leadership levels and accelerated the ideological transformation of engineering and technical personnel and the improvement of the technical level of the workers. However, in our mine, the "three-way combination" has not been smooth sailing.
    The weak link in production, filtration in the flotation workshop, began to show in November last year when Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 blast furnace was put into production and a large amount of ironmaking raw materials were needed. At that time, we put forward the fighting slogan of "Break through the filtration barrier, and the whole mine will turn over," and mobilized the masses of employees to overcome this weak link from all aspects. Cadres, workers, and technicians all actively participated in the battle to break through the filtration barrier. However, because the three parties of cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel were not closely combined, the technical personnel only checked theories, flipped through materials, and worked behind closed doors in the laboratory; the workers only looked for reasons and tried to find solutions from the operation and equipment; although the leading cadres went deep into the front line, they only generally understood the situation and did not concentrate everyone's wisdom and point out the direction. As a result, some budding experiences created by the workers could not be summarized and improved; the technicians' experiments were divorced from reality and could not get the assistance of the workers; the leading cadres did not see the problem accurately and felt at a loss. Therefore, the production effect in the first stage was not significant. We summarized the work in this stage and realized that to break through the production technology barrier, we must closely combine leading cadres, workers, and engineering and technical personnel, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and pool our wisdom. Therefore, we organized leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel to participate in on-the-job operations, work with the workers and explore where the problems were, and hold meetings to study solutions together. After joint labor and numerous "three-way combination" debates, we summarized and promoted the experience of workers such as Zhang Zhimin and Geng Chuanzhen in adding clean water to the slurry, innovated the operating procedures, and at the same time changed the process flow and raised the position of the steam separator, which solved the key problem of insufficient centrifugal pump capacity. Because a series of key problems in production were solved, not only did the production situation significantly improve, but also the leading cadres, workers, and technicians realized the great role of the "three-way combination."
    Socialist enterprises have no exploitation relations, and leading cadres, workers, and technicians have the same goals. This is the foundation of the "three-way combination." However, leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel are, after all, different. Therefore, in the process of "three-way combination," it is very necessary to continuously carry out political and ideological work. An important reason why our mine has achieved certain results in implementing the "three-way combination" is that we have paid attention to political and ideological work. Our mine is a new enterprise, and the employees come from all directions. In addition, the political and ideological work in the past was not sound. There was a certain degree of estrangement between leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel. Therefore, when we called on the three parties to combine together to overcome difficulties, some people did not accept it all at once. After understanding the situation, we found that the main problem was ideological. At that time, the main problem for the leading cadres was that they could not see the role of the masses; many technicians believed that the workers had low cultural levels and did not understand technical theories, so they were unwilling to cooperate with the workers, and when they arrived at the site, they only gesticulated; the workers had opinions on the cadres and technicians. They expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the leading cadres had rarely adopted the workers' rationalization proposals in the past, and believed that the technicians could only talk but not do, and some even believed that "the technological revolution can be carried out without engineers."
    Obviously, without solving these ideological problems, it would be impossible to achieve a true combination. Therefore, we combined the inspection and summary work and carried out ideological education separately. Through various examples, we explained that leading cadres, workers, and technicians have their own strengths and weaknesses, and only by closely combining and giving full play to their respective roles can we do a good job in production and overcome difficulties. In the inspection and summary work, the leading cadres made self-criticisms of their ideas of not paying attention to the workers' rationalization proposals and not believing in the masses. At the same time, they organized cadres and technicians to participate in actual operations and live, eat, and work with the workers. After a series of political and ideological work, the relationship between the three parties was harmonious, which cleared the obstacles for the "three-way combination." In the process of "three-way combination," we also seized every specific example of the combination promoting production and the lack of combination affecting production to educate cadres, workers, and technicians on unity and cooperation, and paid attention to solving some new ideological problems in the process of "three-way combination." Because we have strengthened political and ideological work, especially because the "three-way combination" has continuously exerted its power, it has now become a habit and a normal system for the three parties to combine to solve key problems.
    Using the "three-way combination" method to solve key production problems involves both labor practice and debate, thus twisting the "two participations" and the "three-way combination" into one rope. For a period of time, our understanding of the "three-way combination" was one-sided. We thought that the "three-way combination" was just a meeting where leading cadres, workers, and technicians debated together, but we neglected the combination in labor practice. Experience tells us that the "three-way combination" meeting is important, but if leading cadres and technicians do not participate in labor and closely combine with the workers in labor, then the "three-way combination" meeting will not play a good role. For example, the experience of adding clean water to the slurry appeared very early, but because we did not participate in labor practice in the past and lacked personal experience, we have not paid enough attention to this experience. Later, although we paid attention to it, we did not understand why sometimes adding clean water had a good effect and sometimes adding clean water had a bad effect; at the "three-way combination" meeting, everyone's views were also inconsistent. Later, after leading cadres and technicians worked together with the workers in labor practice and conducted many experiments and research, we finally found the law of adding clean water. Everyone had a common experience, and their views became consistent. On this basis, we summarized six operating points based on the workers' operating experience. After implementing them, the moisture content of the concentrate was reduced and the output increased sharply. At the same time, the content of "two participations" was also enriched through practice (labor) - debate - practice. In the past, leading cadres and technicians participated in labor, often only doing rough labor such as moving bricks and stones, which was also necessary, but it was not closely integrated with production. Later, participating in specific operations and actual experiments around key production problems made our labor closely related to production. On the workers' side, after the "three-way combination," they truly participated in the management of major technical problems of the enterprise and made specific decisions with leading cadres and technicians, effectively exercising their ability to manage the enterprise.
    The experience of the past period of work tells us that the "three-way combination" is not a simple mathematical formula of quantity addition, but an organizational form with core leadership to solve key production problems. Without giving play to the core role of leading cadres, the "three-way combination" will not receive significant results. In the process of "three-way combination," in addition to continuously strengthening ideological leadership and continuously pointing out the direction, we mainly adopted the five-character leadership method of "listening, touching, debating, testing, and doing" in leadership methods. "Listening" is to fully promote democracy and patiently listen to the opinions of all parties; "touching" is to get to the bottom of the situation in labor practice based on the opinions of the masses; "debating" is to organize the "three-way combination" to conduct full debates and concentrate everyone's wisdom; "testing" is to conduct on-site experiments based on the results of the debate and make a decision after affirming it; "doing" is to make a decision based on the test results and organize the vast number of employees to implement it. These five characters are closely related; experience has proven that they are also effective.
    The "three-way combination" takes leading cadres as the core, but it must be based on the mass movement; only on the basis of the mass movement can the "three-way combination" truly exert its power. In the process of breaking through the filtration barrier in our mine, we have always implemented the policy of vigorously carrying out the mass movement and universally mobilized the masses to put forward measures and ideas. The enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and a large number of innovation suggestions have emerged, which not only enriched the content of the "three-way combination" meeting debate, but also created favorable conditions for the realization of technological innovation. In recent months, many experiences promoted by our mine, such as adding clean water to the slurry and mending filter cloths, as well as the realized modification of equipment and innovation of technological procedures, were all innovation suggestions put forward by the employees in the vigorous mass movement, which were summarized and improved by the "three-way combination" meeting before they were realized.
    The "three-way combination" has greatly improved the leadership level and further strengthened the Party's leadership role. Most of the leading cadres in our mine have several years of experience in enterprise work, but they always feel that they do not know much about the situation and that their work cannot be done smoothly. At first, when studying how to break through the filtration barrier, they felt that the filtration technology was complex and they could not figure it out; "can't say accurately, can't explain clearly" This is a portrayal of many of our leading cadres. However, after the "three-way combination," that is, after labor practice and collective debate, this situation has undergone a fundamental change. Through the "three-way combination," we have basically grasped the laws of flotation production, clarified the key problems, and also initially learned how to operate. Through the "three-way combination," we also have a better understanding of the enterprise's situation, the technical level and ideological situation of the workers and technicians, all of which make us have more say in guiding production, which is of great significance to promoting production. Because we can now "say accurately and clearly" about the enterprise's situation and problems, the leadership work is also more proactive; at the same time, the relationship between the leaders and the masses is closer than ever before.
     The "three-way combination" has also accelerated the growth of technical talents and effectively improved the enterprise's production technology level. In the past, many technicians did not play a big role in production because they were divorced from reality and the masses of workers, and they themselves were also very distressed. Through the "three-way combination," they began to master practical knowledge, technical theories and practical operations were better combined, and they also learned excellent qualities from the workers, which is of great significance to accelerating their ideological transformation. On the workers' side, in the past, they often only operated based on experience due to the lack of technical theories. Through the "three-way combination," this situation has also changed. Now many people not only know that adding clean water is good, but also know why it is good and have mastered the knowledge of the relationship between concentration, vacuum degree, and water addition. The old worker Xie Qiliang and others used to propose to change the steam separator from horizontal to vertical based on experience, but they did not understand why it was good to change it this way. Through the "three-way combination," he understood it. Many workers and technicians said that they learned more through this stage of work than they had learned in the past few years.

    “三结合”是个“宝”
    中共鞍钢东鞍山铁矿委员会副书记  刘志远
    鞍钢东鞍山铁矿矿长  高扬
    鞍钢东鞍山铁矿是一个现代化的黑色冶金原料联合企业。它把含铁32％左右的赤色贫铁矿开采出来，经过破碎，浮选成含铁60％以上的精矿粉，烧成烧结矿送去炼铁。按照计划要求，今年全矿生产的烧结矿原料经过高炉、平炉冶炼后，可以炼出优质钢一百万吨以上。但是从去年10月正式投入生产后，长期生产不出合乎要求的精矿；烧结车间要求的是干精矿，而浮选车间过滤机过滤出来的精矿水分高，产量也低。这个问题不迅速解决，不仅影响采矿、破碎、烧结上下工序的正常生产，而且还会影响鞍钢和全国钢产任务的超额完成。我们在上级党委的领导下，在冶金工业部工作组的具体指导下，从去年11月起，发动全矿职工，运用领导干部、工人和工程技术人员“三结合”的方法，大闹技术革命，革新了设备、操作方法和工艺规程，终于突破了生产关键，精矿含水量由原来的15％左右降到12％左右，产量由一千多吨提高到五千吨以上。这个生产成果的获得，不仅使我们增加了向更高生产目标跃进的信心，而且也使我们深刻地体会到贯彻“三结合”的重大意义。
    几个月来的经验告诉我们，领导干部、工人和工程技术人员三方面的密切结合，是全面地依靠工人阶级办好企业的重要保证，也是使技术革命和技术革新运动深入广泛开展的有效方法。由于在过去这一段工作里，初步地贯彻了“三结合”，我们在领导和群众的关系方面，在理论和实践的统一方面，在党的政治思想工作和生产技术工作相结合、冲天干劲和科学分析相结合等方面，都有了很大的成果，不仅突破了生产关键，保证了生产水平的不断提高，而且还有效地提高了领导水平，加速了工程技术人员的思想改造和工人群众技术水平的提高。但是，在我们矿来说，“三结合”并不是一帆风顺的。
    浮选车间过滤这一生产薄弱环节，从去年11月随着鞍钢十号高炉投入生产大量需要炼铁原料的时候，就已显露出来。当时我们提出了“突破过滤关，全矿把身翻”的战斗口号，发动职工群众从各个方面来克服这一薄弱环节。干部、工人和技术人员都积极投入了突破过滤关的战斗。但是，由于干部、工人、工程技术人员三方面没有密切结合，技术人员只是查理论，翻资料，闷头在试验室搞试验；工人只是自己从操作上、设备上找原因，想办法；领导干部虽然深入现场，但只是一般地了解情况，没有很好地集中大家的智慧，指出方向，其结果是：工人创造的一些萌芽性经验得不到总结提高；技术人员的试验脱离实际，得不到工人的协助；领导干部对问题看得不准，感到茫无头绪，因而头一阶段生产效果很不显著。我们总结了这一阶段的工作，认识到要突破生产技术关，就必须使领导干部、工人和工程技术人员密切结合起来，取长补短，集思广益。于是我们便组织领导干部、工程技术人员参加岗位操作，同工人群众一起劳动和摸索问题所在，一起开会研究解决办法。经过共同劳动和无数次的“三结合”辩论会，我们总结和推广了张志民、耿传珍等工人往矿浆里加清水的经验，革新了操作规程，同时改变了工艺过程，升高了水汽分离器的位置，使离心泵能力不足的关键问题迎刃而解。由于解决了生产上的一系列关键问题，不但生产情况显著好转，而且也使领导干部、工人和技术人员认识到“三结合”的重大作用。
    社会主义企业没有剥削关系，领导干部、工人和技术人员目标一致，这是“三结合”的基础。但是，领导干部、工人和技术人员三者毕竟还有差异，因而在“三结合”的过程中，不断地进行政治思想工作，就十分必要。我们矿在贯彻“三结合”方面所以取得一定的成果，一个重要原因，就是注意了政治思想工作。我们矿是一个新的企业，职工来自四面八方，加上过去政治思想工作不健全，在领导干部、工人和技术人员之间，互相都存在着一定程度的隔阂，因而当我们号召三者结合起来共同突破难关的时候，有些人并没有一下子接受。经过了解，发现主要是思想问题。当时领导干部方面主要是看不到群众的作用；许多技术人员认为工人文化低，不懂技术理论，因而不愿同工人合作，到了现场也只是指手划脚；工人对干部和技术人员都有意见，他们对领导干部过去很少采纳工人合理化建议表示不满，认为技术人员只会说不会做，有的人甚至认为“没有工程师也一样闹技术革命”。
    很显然，不解决这些思想问题，就不可能做到真正的结合。于是我们结合检查总结工作，分别地进行了思想教育，通过各种事例说明领导干部、工人和技术人员各有所长，也各有所短，只有密切结合起来，发挥各自的作用，才能搞好生产，突破难关。在检查总结工作中，领导干部对不重视工人合理化建议、不相信群众的思想作了检讨，同时组织干部、技术人员参加实际操作，同工人同吃同住同劳动。经过一系列的政治思想工作，三方面的关系融洽了，从而给“三结合”扫除了障碍。在“三结合”的过程中，我们又抓住结合起来推动生产和不结合起来影响生产的每一个具体事例向干部、工人和技术人员进行了团结合作的教育，并注意解决“三结合”过程中一些新的思想问题。由于加强了政治思想工作，特别是“三结合”不断发挥了威力，现在三者结合起来解决关键问题，已经成了习惯和正常的制度。
    运用“三结合”方法解决生产关键问题，都是经过劳动实践和辩论两个过程的，因而也就使“两参”和“三结合”拧成了一股绳。有一个时期，我们对“三结合”的理解是片面的，认为“三结合”只是开个会，领导干部、工人和技术人员在一起辩论，而忽视了在劳动实践中的结合。经验告诉我们，“三结合”会固然重要，但是如果没有领导干部、技术人员参加劳动，在劳动中同工人密切结合，那么“三结合”会就不会发挥良好的作用。如往矿浆里加清水的经验，很早就出现了，但是由于我们过去没有参加劳动实践，缺乏切身体会，对这个经验一直不够重视，以后虽然引起了注意，但对为什么有时加清水效果好、有时加清水效果又不好，弄不清楚；在“三结合”会上，大家看法也不一致。以后经过领导干部、技术人员同工人一起劳动实践和多次试验研究，终于找到了加清水的规律。大家有了共同的体验，看法也就一致了，在这个基础上，我们根据工人的操作经验，总结出六条操作要点，贯彻执行后，精矿水分降低，产量猛增。同时，通过实践（劳动）——辩论——实践，也丰富了“两参”的内容。过去领导干部、技术人员参加劳动，往往只是做一些搬砖石之类的粗劳动，这虽然也需要，但同生产结合的不紧密。后来围绕生产关键问题参加具体操作和实际试验，就使我们的劳动同生产紧密联系起来。在工人方面，经过“三结合”，真正参加了企业重大技术问题的管理，同领导干部、技术人员一起具体做出有关的决定，有效地锻炼了管理企业的能力。
    过去这一段工作的经验告诉我们，“三结合”并不是单纯的数量相加的数学公式，而是一个有核心领导的解决生产关键问题的组织形式。不发挥领导干部的核心作用，“三结合”就不会收到显著的效果。我们在“三结合”过程中，除了不断加强思想领导、不断指出方向以外，在领导方法上主要采取了“听、摸、辩、试、干”的五字领导方法。“听”是充分发扬民主，耐心听取各方面的意见；“摸”是根据群众的意见，在劳动实践中摸底；“辩”是组织好“三结合”进行充分辩论，集中大家的智慧；“试”是根据辩论的结果，进行实地试验，肯定了再做出决定；“干”是根据试验结果，做出决定，组织广大职工实行。这五个字是密切联系的；经验证明，也是有效的。
    “三结合”以领导干部为核心，但必须以群众运动为基础；只有在群众运动的基础上，
  “三结合”才能真正发挥它的威力。我们矿在突破过滤关的过程中，始终贯彻了大搞群众运动的方针，普遍发动群众提措施，想办法。群众积极性十分高涨，各种革新建议大量出现，不仅充实了“三结合”会辩论的内容，而且也为实现技术革新创造了有利条件。最近几个月来，我们矿推广的往矿浆里加清水、补过滤布等许多经验，以及实现的改装设备、革新工艺规程等，都是职工群众在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中提出革新建议，经过“三结合”会加以总结提高，然后才实现的。
    “三结合”使领导水平有了很大的提高，进一步加强了党的领导作用。我们矿大多数领导干部都有好几年企业工作的经验，但是总感到了解情况不多，感到工作不能得心应手。最初在研究突破过滤关的时候，觉得过滤技术复杂，摸不着头脑；“说不准，讲不清”这就是我们许多领导干部的写照。但是经过“三结合”，也就是经过劳动实践和集体辩论，这种情况有了根本的改变。通过“三结合”，我们基本上摸到了浮选生产的规律，弄清了关键问题的所在，还初步学会了操作。通过“三结合”，我们对企业的状况、工人和技术人员的技术水平和思想情况，也有了更多的了解，所有这些，都使我们对指导生产有了更多的发言权，这对促进生产有着很大的意义。由于我们对企业情况和问题开始能够“说得准、说得清”，领导工作也更加主动了；同时领导和群众的关系也比过去任何时候都更加密切。
      “三结合”还加快了技术人材的成长，有效地提高了企业的生产技术水平。许多技术人员过去由于脱离实际和工人群众，对生产起的作用不大，他们自己也很苦恼。通过“三结合”，他们开始掌握了实际知识，技术理论和实际操作有了更好的结合，并且还从工人身上学到了优秀品质，这对加快他们的思想改造，有着很大的意义。在工人方面来说，过去由于缺乏技术理论，往往只凭经验操作。通过
  “三结合”，这种情况也有了改变。现在许多人不但知道加清水好，而且知道为什么好，掌握了浓度、真空度和加水的关系的知识。老工人谢起良等人过去凭经验提议把水汽分离器由卧式改为立式，但是这样改为什么好，却弄不清楚，通过“三结合”，他才明白了。许多工人和技术人员都说，通过这一阶段的工作，学到的东西比过去几年学到的还多。
