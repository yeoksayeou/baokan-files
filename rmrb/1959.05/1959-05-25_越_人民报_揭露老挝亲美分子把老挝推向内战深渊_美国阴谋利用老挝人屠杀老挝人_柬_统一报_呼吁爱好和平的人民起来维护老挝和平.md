Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 24th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today pointing out that the conspiracy of the Lao Phoui Sananikone government is part of a conspiracy planned by American imperialism. This conspiracy of the United States is to create tension in Indochina and realize its plan to invade Indochina countries formulated at the Wellington meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The editorial then pointed out that it is no coincidence that the Phoui Sananikone government dispatched armed forces to carry out large-scale suppression and destruction of Lao patriotic and progressive forces, which occurred at the same time as the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's implementation of frantic "sweeps" in South Vietnam. Obviously, these events were carried out under the direction of American imperialism.

The editorial pointed out that wasn't US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson recently boasting that the United States had been able to direct the Phoui Sananikone government to abandon the Geneva Accords and create tension in Indochina? Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya also announced in Saigon that he would "seek" the help of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other anti-communist international organizations and countries in the event of so-called "foreign aggression" in Laos. This is exactly an admission of the illegal collusion between the Phoui Sananikone government and the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc headed by the United States.

The editorial said that the pro-American reactionaries in the Phoui Sananikone government tore up the Geneva Accords and the agreement signed between the Lao Royal Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and are wantonly pushing Laos into the abyss of civil war. The editorial said that they are willing to act as tools for American imperialism to realize its goal of using Laotians to massacre Laotians, and attempt to drag Laos into the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc in order to further oppose Laos' neighbors.

The editorial condemned the Phoui Sananikone government's slander against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. The editorial said that the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units are patriotic fighters who have fought heroically for the freedom and independence of Laos. In the supplementary general election of the National Assembly in May 1958, the Lao people voted for the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party. This proves the Lao people's love and support for the Patriotic Party.

The editorial said that public opinion in Southeast Asia and the world has in the past and is now severely condemning and warning American imperialism and the reactionaries in the Phoui Sananikone government for seriously violating the Geneva Accords and undermining peace. The editorial said: "We firmly believe that the Lao people, who love peace and have a tradition of unity and struggle, will certainly not allow American interventionists and their pawns to realize their vicious conspiracies."

The editorial pointed out that those who wantonly create bloodshed in Laos and undermine peace in Indochina will inevitably suffer a painful defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 23rd: The Cambodian "Unity Daily" published an editorial on the 22nd, calling on the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference to urge the Lao International Commission to immediately continue its activities; and calling on all peace-loving people to mobilize to safeguard peace in Laos.

The newspaper pointed out that the Lao government's recent actions to undermine the Geneva Accords and the agreement reached between the two sides in Laos cannot be unrelated to the conspiracy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. It said that since the resignation of the Phouma cabinet in Laos, the imperialists have intensified their actions to interfere in Laos' internal affairs; and the persecution of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units has also been intensifying. The Lao government tore up the Geneva Accords, suspended the activities of the Lao International Commission, and participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's exercises several times. At the same time, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization sent a large number of weapons and some military personnel to Laos, gradually dragging Laos into a trap.

The newspaper pointed out that if Laos joins the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, or if a civil war breaks out in Laos, Cambodia will be threatened by war, and Cambodian traitors such as Sam Sary and Son Ngoc Thanh will also take the opportunity to stir up trouble.

    越“人民报”揭露老挝亲美分子把老挝推向内战深渊
    美国阴谋利用老挝人屠杀老挝人
    柬“统一报”呼吁爱好和平的人民起来维护老挝和平
    新华社河内24日电　越南“人民报”今天发表的社论指出，老挝培·萨纳尼空政府的阴谋是美帝国主义策划的阴谋的一部分。美国的这个阴谋是为了制造印度支那紧张局势，实现它在东南亚条约军事集团惠灵顿会议上所制订的侵略印度支那各国的计划。
    社论接着指出，培·萨纳尼空政府出动武装力量向老挝爱国进步力量进行大规模的镇压和破坏同吴庭艳集团在南越实行疯狂的“扫荡”同时发生，这并不是偶然的现象。显然，这些事件都是在美帝国主义指使下进行的。
    社论指出，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊最近不是吹嘘过美国已经能够指使培·萨纳尼空政府废弃日内瓦协议并且在印度支那制造紧张局势吗？老挝政府外交大臣坎番·班雅也在西贡宣布，在老挝发生所谓“外国侵略”时，他将“寻求”东南亚条约组织以及其他反共的国际组织和国家的帮助。这正好供认了培·萨纳尼空政府同以美国为首的东南亚侵略集团的非法勾结。
    社论说，培·萨纳尼空政府中的亲美反动分子撕毁了日内瓦协议以及老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，正在恣意把老挝推向内战的深渊。社论说，他们甘心充当美帝国主义实现其用老挝人屠杀老挝人的工具，而且企图把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团，以进一步反对老挝的邻国。
    社论斥责培·萨纳尼空政府对前寮国战斗部队的诬蔑。社论说，前寮国战斗部队是爱国战士，他们曾经为争取老挝的自由独立而英勇奋斗。在1958年5月的国会补充普选中，老挝人民投老挝爱国党领袖们的票。这证明了老挝人民对爱国党的爱戴。
    社论说，东南亚和世界各国的舆论过去曾经而现在也正在严厉谴责和警告美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府中的反动分子严重地破坏日内瓦协议、破坏和平的行为。社论说：“我们坚信爱好和平和具有团结斗争传统的老挝人民一定不允许美国干涉者及其爪牙实现他们的恶毒阴谋。”
    社论指出，恣意在老挝制造流血事件并且破坏印度支那和平的人，必将遭到惨痛的失败。
    新华社金边23日电　柬埔寨“统一报”在22日发表社论，呼吁1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席促使老挝国际委员会立即继续进行它的活动；并且呼吁一切爱好和平的人民动员起来维护老挝的和平。
    这家报纸指出，老挝政府最近采取的破坏日内瓦协议和老挝双方达成的协议的行动不可能同东南亚条约组织的阴谋没有关系。它说，自从老挝富马内阁辞职以来，帝国主义就加紧了干涉老挝内政的行动；对前寮国战斗部队的迫害也在日益加剧。老挝政府撕毁了日内瓦协议，停止了老挝国际委员会的活动，并且几次参加东南亚条约组织的演习。同时，东南亚条约组织把大批武器和若干军事人员送到老挝，把老挝逐步拖到陷阱中去。
    这家报纸指出，老挝参加东南亚条约组织，或者在老挝发生内战，柬埔寨都将受到战争的威胁，而桑·萨里和山玉成等柬埔寨的叛国分子也将趁机蠢动。
