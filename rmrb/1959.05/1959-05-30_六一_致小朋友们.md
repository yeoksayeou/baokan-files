    Greetings to the Children on "June 1st"
    Dong Biwu
    Little friends! The annual "June 1st" International Children's Day has arrived, and I warmly congratulate you. I hope you grow up quickly like saplings and become outstanding talents for socialist construction.
    You are growing up in the beautiful new socialist China. Under the meticulous care and love of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, you are living the happiest lives. You may not realize this, so you can go home and ask your grandparents, parents, and older neighbors what kind of days they lived when they were young. Did the children at that time all have food to eat, clothes to wear, and books to read like you do now? Were they all able to study without worries and play happily like you do now?
    If we don't talk about the past and only talk about the present, there are still developed or underdeveloped capitalist countries in the world. The majority of children in those countries still live very miserable lives. Their fate is completely different from yours and the children of socialist countries. There, millions of children are forced to work as child laborers or wander the streets because their parents are unemployed or their income is too low and their living problems cannot be solved. Many children, poisoned by bourgeois education and influenced by corrupt and decadent lifestyles, have embarked on the road of crime, to the extent that juvenile delinquency has become a serious social problem in these countries. You may have heard your teachers or parents talk about these things.
    You can compare your own situation with your parents' childhood and then compare it with the children of capitalist countries. Then you will know how beautiful and happy a society you are living in! If you understand this point, you should work hard and never waste your happy childhood.
    How can you avoid wasting it? I think that if you can learn the noble qualities of diligence, simplicity, honesty, and bravery of our working people when you are young, and develop the following good habits from an early age, you will have the right to say in the future: "I have not wasted my happy childhood!"
    First, love the motherland, love the people, love learning, love labor, and love your own organizations—the Young Pioneers, the Communist Youth League, and the Communist Party.
    Second, be honest and upright. Never tell lies at school or at home, and be a good child who does not deceive.
    Third, set your ambitions and learn a skill well, and be prepared to resolutely serve the cause of socialist construction in the future.
    Fourth, listen to the teachings of your parents and teachers. It is precisely because your parents and teachers are working hard along with the working people of the whole country to change the backward economic outlook of the motherland that they have created good conditions for the healthy development of your body and mind. Therefore, you must respect your parents and teachers.
    Fifth, live frugally and simply, and be humble and sincere to others.
    Sixth, resolutely do not do things that harm or hinder socialist construction, and at the same time be able to firmly and bravely fight against the enemy and various bad phenomena in society.
    If you children can do these things, you will become successors to the cause of communist construction who are educated and love labor. A bright and brilliant future belongs to you!

    “六一”致小朋友们
    董必武
    小朋友们！一年一度的“六一”国际儿童节到来了，我热烈地祝贺你们，我希望你们像小树一样快快长大，长成为社会主义建设的优秀人才。
    你们生长在美丽的社会主义新中国，在党中央和毛主席无微不至的关怀爱护之下，你们过着最幸福的生活。你们也许体会不到这点，那么可以回家去问自己的祖父母、父母和邻居长一辈的人，问问他们小时候过的是什么日子？那时的儿童是不是都和你们现在一样，有饭吃，有衣穿，有书读？是不是都能像你们现在这样无忧无虑的学习和欢欣愉快的游戏？
    如果不讲过去，只说目前，现在世界上还有资本主义发达或者不发达的国家，那些国家里的大多数儿童仍然过着十分悲惨的生活。他们的命运和你们，和社会主义国家的儿童完全不同。那里，千百万小朋友因为父母失业或收入太少，生活问题不能解决，被迫做童工或流浪街头。许多儿童因为受到资产阶级教育的毒害，在腐化堕落的生活方式影响之下，走上了犯罪的道路，以至少年儿童犯罪成了这些国家严重的社会问题。关于这些，你们可能听老师或爸爸妈妈讲过了。
    你们可以把自己的情况和爸爸妈妈的童年比较一下，再和资本主义国家的儿童比较一下，那时你们就会知道自己是生活在多么美好、幸福的社会了！如果你们懂了这点，你们就该发奋努力，千万不要空过自己幸福的童年时代。
    怎样才算不空过呢？我想，你们如果能够在小时候学习我国劳动人民勤劳朴素诚实勇敢的高贵品质，使自己从小就养成以下几方面的良好习惯，你们将来就有权利说：“我没有浪费掉自己幸福的童年时代！”
    第一，爱祖国，爱人民，爱学习，爱劳动，爱自己的组织——少先队、共青团和共产党。
    第二，诚实、正直。无论在校在家都不说谎话，做一个不骗人的好孩子。
    第三，立定志向，学好一种本领，准备将来坚决为社会主义建设事业服务。
    第四，听从父母和老师的教导。正是因为你们的父母和老师，同全国劳动人民一道辛勤劳动着、改变着祖国的落后经济面貌，才给你们身心的健康发展创造了良好条件，因此你们一定要尊敬父母和老师。
    第五，生活节俭、朴素，对人谦虚诚恳。
    第六，坚决不做损害或妨碍社会主义建设的事情，同时能够坚定勇敢地和敌人以及社会上各种不良现象作斗争。
    小朋友们如果能做到这几点，你们就将成为有文化、爱劳动的共产主义建设的接班人。光明灿烂的未来是属于你们的！
                              （原载5月28日中国少年报）
