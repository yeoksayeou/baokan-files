Shanghai, May 27th (By our reporter) - Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant deeply mobilized the masses, and through continuous experimentation and reference to past accumulated historical data, summarized a set of operating methods to improve the life of converter furnaces. This allowed the furnace life to rapidly increase from an average of 31 heats to 48 heats, reaching a maximum of 74 heats, creating the highest converter furnace life record in Shanghai this year. With the extension of furnace life, steel production surged. This successful experiment is of great significance for rapidly increasing steel production and quality.

The basic point of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant's method of improving converter furnace life is to adopt a "steelmaking and furnace maintenance" approach in operation. In the early stages of using a new furnace, the amount of hot metal charged is reduced, and then gradually increased. During the blowing process, the furnace rocking angle does not exceed 20 degrees, and efforts are made to create good slag and eliminate post-blowing. The benefits of this are: because the amount of hot metal charged in the first few heats is small, the furnace chamber space is large, which eases the erosion of the furnace wall by the gas flow and slag, allowing the furnace lining to further sinter more firmly and durably during the hot metal smelting process.

The adoption of new operating methods has brought great benefits to Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant. This plant has six fixed three-ton converters. In the past, due to the short furnace life, the time spent on bricklaying and baking furnaces was long, so only two furnaces could be opened each day, and sometimes even opening two could not be guaranteed. Now that the furnace life has been extended, as long as other equipment is coordinated, it is possible to consistently maintain three furnaces steelmaking. Since the start of the experiment on May 11th, the average furnace life has increased from around 30 heats in the past to over 40 heats. In the 14 days from May 11th to 24th, the average daily steel production reached over 300 tons, an increase of 16.5% compared to the average daily production in early May; on the 18th and 22nd, it reached 411 tons and 427 tons respectively, creating the highest record since the plant was built, an increase of 57% to 63% compared to the average daily production in early May. The qualification rate of steel reached over 98%.

Furthermore, Shanghai steel plants are vigorously promoting the experience of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant in maintaining converter equipment, and furnace life has generally been extended, and steel production has rapidly increased, and quality has continued to improve. From May 16th to 24th, the average daily steel production in the city increased by more than 22% compared to the first half of the month. The qualification rate of steel in the No. 1, 5, and 6 plants and the No. 1 converter workshop of the No. 3 plant averaged around 97%.

Converter equipment in Shanghai accounts for more than 80% of the city's steelmaking capacity. The increase in converter steel production is of great significance for the rapid growth of the city's steel production. The length of converter furnace life is related to the quality of iron materials and the quality of work in all aspects of production, among which the main determining factors are the quality of bricklaying and whether steelworkers pay attention to maintaining the furnace. The set of operating methods of "steelmaking and furnace maintenance" found by Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant to extend furnace life and increase steel production has aroused the attention of relevant departments in Shanghai. The Metallurgical Bureau immediately convened an on-site meeting, and Comrade Ma Tianshui, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, personally attended the meeting. After this meeting, in just a few days, the experience of the No. 6 plant achieved immediate results in steel plants throughout the city. The average furnace life of most factories has been increased to around 40 heats, and steel production has rapidly increased. After learning the experience of the No. 6 plant, the No. 1 converter workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant, combined with the situation in its own workshop, and after experimentation, the No. 1 furnace achieved a record of 47 heats, and the general furnace life also reached 40 heats. The average furnace life of the No. 2 converter workshop of the No. 1 Steel Plant was only 22 heats in April, and now it has reached 36 heats and 39 heats, of which one reached 65 heats. With the improvement of furnace life, steel production on the 20th reached 813 tons, creating a new record for steel production this year, an increase of more than 40% compared to the average daily production in the first half of the month. The furnace life of the No. 5 Steel Plant was the lowest in the city in the past. After learning the experience of the No. 6 plant, it jumped from an average of about 20 heats to more than 30 heats in recent days, and the daily steel production broke through the 600-ton mark, reaching 687 tons on the 21st, creating the highest record this year.

After the advanced experience of extending furnace life rapidly blossomed and bore fruit in factories throughout the city, all the staff and workers of the converter workshop of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, after full deliberation and discussion, once again proposed on the 22nd to all fraternal converter steelmaking workshops in the city to carry out a five-comparison competition of quality, high yield, furnace life, iron consumption, and safety. Converter steelworkers in all factories enthusiastically responded. This competition movement has now begun, marking that a new leap forward upsurge will appear on the Shanghai steel front.

    维护细心  操作有方
    上钢六厂创转炉延长炉龄经验
    本报上海27日电  上海第六钢铁厂深入发动群众，经过不断试验和参考过去积累的历史资料，总结出一套提高转炉炉龄的操作方法，使炉龄从过去的平均三十一炉，迅速上升到四十八炉，最高达到七十四炉，创造了今年以来上海转炉炉龄的最高纪录。随着炉龄的延长，钢产量猛增。这个试验成功对迅速提高钢的产量和质量有着十分重大的意义。
    上钢六厂提高转炉炉龄的基本要点是操作中采用“炼钢又炼炉”的方法，在新炉子使用初期，铁水装入量少些，以后逐渐增加。吹炼过程中，摇炉角度不超过二十度，并尽量造好渣子，消除后吹。这样做的好处是：因为开始几炉铁水装入量少，炉膛空间大，缓和了气流和渣子对炉壁的冲蚀，使炉衬在铁水的熔炼过程中，进一步烧结得更为结实坚韧。
    采用新的操作方法，给上钢六厂带来了很大的好处。这个厂有六只固定式三吨转炉，过去因为炉龄短，砌炉、烘炉的时间长，每天只能开两只炉子，有时连开两只也不能保证。现在炉龄延长了，只要其他设备配合上，就可以经常保持三只炉子炼钢。从5月11日开始试验以来，平均炉龄从过去三十炉左右提高到四十炉以上。5月11日到24日的十四天中，钢的平均日产量达到三百吨以上，比5月上旬平均日产量增加16.5％；18日和22日，曾达到日产钢四百一十一吨和四百二十七吨，创造建厂以来的最高纪录，比5月上旬平均日产量增长57％到63％。钢的合格率达到98％以上。
    又讯  上海各钢铁厂大力推广上钢六厂维护转炉设备的经验，炉龄普遍延长，钢的产量迅速上升，质量继续提高。从5月16日到24日，全市钢的平均日产量比上半月增长22％以上。上钢一、五、六厂和三厂的第一转炉车间，钢的合格率平均达到97％左右。
    上海的转炉设备，占全市炼钢设备能力的80％以上。转炉钢产量的提高，对全市钢产量迅速增长有重要意义。转炉炉龄的长短，同铁料质量和生产中各个环节的工作好坏有关，其中主要决定于砌炉质量好坏和炼钢工人是否注意维护炉子。上钢六厂找到的“炼钢又炼炉”的一套延长炉龄、增加钢产量的操作方法，引起了上海市各有关部门的重视，冶金局马上召开了现场会议，中共上海市委书记处书记马天水同志亲自参加了这个会议。经过这次会议，在短短几天中，六厂的经验便在全市各钢铁厂取得了立竿见影的效果。大多数工厂的转炉炉龄，平均提高到四十炉左右，钢产量迅速上升。上钢三厂一转炉车间，在学习了六厂的经验以后，结合本车间的情况，经过试验，一号炉出现了四十七炉的纪录，一般炉龄也达到四十炉。上钢一厂第二转炉车间4月份平均炉龄只有二十二炉，现在已达到三十六炉、三十九炉，其中有一只达到六十五炉。随着炉龄提高，20日这一天钢产量达到八百一十三吨，创造了今年以来钢产量的新纪录，比本月上半月的平均日产量提高40％以上。上钢五厂转炉炉龄过去是全市最低的，在学习了六厂的经验以后，连日来从原来平均二十炉左右跃到三十多炉，钢的日产量冲破六百吨大关，21日达到六百八十七吨，创造了今年以来最高纪录。
    延长炉龄的先进经验迅速在全市各厂开花结果以后，上钢六厂转炉车间的全体职工，经过充分酝酿讨论，在22日再次倡议全市各兄弟转炉炼钢车间，开展比优质、比高产、比炉龄、比铁耗、比安全的五比竞赛。各厂转炉炼钢工人都热烈响应。这个竞赛运动目前已经开始，它标志着上海钢铁战线将出现新的跃进高潮。
