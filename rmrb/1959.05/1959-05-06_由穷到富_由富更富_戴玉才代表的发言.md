Chairman, fellow delegates:

　　I fully support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Now, I will address the congress on how the Cangji Brigade of the Cangji People's Commune in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, transformed from poor to rich.

　　Let me start with the history of the Cangji Brigade. This production brigade was originally the Cangji Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative of Siyang County and is now a brigade of the Cangji People's Commune. Like the path taken by China's 500 million peasants, the Cangji Brigade went from individual operation to temporary mutual aid teams, from temporary mutual aid teams to year-round mutual aid teams, from year-round mutual aid teams to elementary agricultural production cooperatives, from elementary agricultural production cooperatives to advanced agricultural production cooperatives, and from advanced agricultural production cooperatives to people's communes. It took a full nine years, from 1951, when it started on the road of mutual aid and cooperation, to 1958, when it was reorganized into a people's commune. During these nine years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Cangji Brigade underwent tremendous changes, gradually moving away from individual ownership to collective ownership, eliminating the root of poverty, developing production, and gradually transforming from poor to rich, and is moving towards an even more prosperous future.

　　Output Higher Year After Year

　　The predecessor of the Cangji Brigade was a mutual aid team composed of thirteen individually operated farm households. It has now become a production brigade with 637 households and 2,827 people. When it was a mutual aid team, the Cangji Brigade only had half an ox (sharing one ox with a neighboring team), one wooden plow, some spades for plowing the land, and some barren alkaline land. Now, it has two tractors, two seeders, one water pump, one threshing machine, thirty-two rubber-wheeled carts, four ox carts, more than eighty sprayers, two hundred and twenty-seven head of draught animals, more than four hundred plows, harrows, waterwheels, seedling transplanters, and 4,840 mu of improved land.

　　The public accumulation of the Cangji Brigade has gradually increased. During the mutual aid team period, it was only more than two hundred yuan, more than one thousand yuan during the elementary cooperative period, more than sixty thousand yuan during the advanced cooperative period, and now it has more than one hundred thousand yuan.

　　The output of the Cangji Brigade has increased year by year. Taking grain output as an example, the average yield per mu before liberation and in the early days of liberation was about 100 jin, 229 jin per mu in 1952, 343 jin per mu in 1953, 384 jin per mu in 1954, 443 jin per mu in 1955. Due to a major flood disaster in 1956, the yield was 350 jin per mu, 484 jin per mu in 1957, and 800 jin per mu in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The Cangji Brigade started planting cotton in 1956, with a yield of 30.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu in that year, 81 jin per mu in 1957, and 186 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1958.

　　Life is Getting Better Year After Year

　　The life of the members of the Cangji Brigade is gradually improving. Before liberation, the average annual net income per person was about 30 yuan, 34 yuan in 1952, 40 yuan in 1953, 46.1 yuan in 1954, 59 yuan in 1955, 60 yuan in 1956, 90 yuan in 1957, and reached 128 yuan in 1958. Before cooperativization, 50 percent of the families relied on government relief every spring, some families were without food for several months a year, and many families did not have cotton clothes and trousers in the cold winter, living a life of hunger and cold with coarse food for half the year. After cooperativization, the lives of the peasants improved year by year. Now, everyone has cotton clothes and trousers, several sets of single and lined clothes, and young people have sanitary shirts, sneakers, and rubber shoes. Every family has a thermos bottle, and 290 families have opened deposit accounts in the bank. After communization, the Cangji Brigade implemented free meals, and established public welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and health clinics, and the lives of the members have improved significantly.

　　In recent years, the Cangji Brigade has undergone profound and tremendous changes. Its transformation from poor to rich has been a process of hard struggle.

　　Transforming Alkaline Land and Low-Lying Land, Bumper Harvests of Rice and Cotton

　　Our brigade is located north of Hongze Lake and south of the abandoned Yellow River滩. Alkaline soil accounts for more than 80 percent. No matter what crops are planted, only dozens of jin per mu can be harvested. Among them, there are many low-lying areas, with floods in nine out of ten years, resulting in planting without harvest. Since cooperativization, we have put forward the slogan of "declaring war on alkaline land and demanding grain from the land," and have adopted various methods such as deep plowing, inter-tillage, soil replacement, and alkaline capping, to thoroughly improve the soil in a planned and step-by-step manner. Up to now, more than 90 percent of the alkaline land has been converted into fertile land, with bumper harvests every year. There are eight mu of heavily alkaline land next to Lizhuang, which belongs to member Han Qin, because the alkalinity was too heavy, he abandoned it for three years without planting. In the spring of 1958, the cooperative organized forces to exchange silt and alkaline soil, generally replacing three inches of soil. When cotton was planted, the average yield of ginned cotton was 288.5 jin per mu. The neighboring Liangzhou Cooperative had more than 20 mu of heavily alkaline land, and every year they planted a little miscellaneous grain in a perfunctory manner, and the yield was extremely low. In the spring of 1958, the Liangzhou Cooperative sent this piece of alkaline land to us in one breath. They said: "Give this piece of land to you! Pay the bill for eighteen years. If you can cultivate it well in eighteen years, then you are "good guys."" Our members and cooperative cadres were determined to cultivate this piece of land well, and immediately organized labor to carry out deep plowing, inter-tillage, soil replacement, and river siltation, and planted cotton and carrots, etc. As a result, the yield of ginned cotton was 200 jin per mu, and the yield of carrots was more than 2,000 jin per mu.

　　After the land was improved, we gradually and appropriately expanded the cotton field area year by year, expanding to 1,400 mu in 1958, accounting for 30 percent of the total cultivated area, greatly increasing the economic income of the members. After nearly one-third of the land was converted from grain to cotton, in response to the reduction in the grain planting area, we also adopted measures such as increasing the grain multiple cropping index and improving land utilization, changing the farming system from three crops in two years to two crops in one year and partially five crops in two years, so that the grain multiple cropping index reached 242 percent, and we reclaimed 400 mu of wasteland. Therefore, although the grain field area was reduced, the total grain output increased significantly, not only being able to be self-sufficient, but also having a surplus. In the spring of 1958, we also marched towards the low-lying areas and implemented drought-to-water conversion, but there was a lack of water sources, so we decided to open irrigation canals to divert water from Hongze Lake from Wuhe for irrigation. At that time, some people said: "How can tears flow upwards?" But we were determined to mobilize all members to fight hard, excavate 71,000 cubic meters of earth, and build a large canal to make the water flow uphill, and really brought the water of Hongze Lake from Wuhe. From then on, the alkaline land and low-lying land were conquered by us, and rice and cotton had bumper harvests every year.

　　Looking back now, when we were engaged in mutual aid and cooperation, we were really empty-handed. At that time, there were no draught animals, no farm tools, no fertilizers, and no funds. These difficulties did not scare us. On the contrary, it further motivated our fighting spirit and stimulated our determination to get rid of poverty. The members said: "We are poor but our ambitions are not poor, the land is bad but the people are not bad, with the leadership of the Party, everything can be done well." We vigorously carried out mass fertilizer accumulation campaigns, digging one meter deep into the thousand-footed soil of Cangji Street, opening mud ponds in winter to freeze blocks, bailing out accumulated water, and digging up black mud. In summer and autumn, we vigorously composted green manure, and mobilized members to raise pigs and sheep, so the amount of fertilizer applied increased year by year, and the output increased year by year. We tightened our belts, practiced diligence and thrift, and gradually expanded public accumulation from production, using the smallest funds for production. In recent years, the brigade office and desks and chairs have been borrowed. We have not built offices or bought bicycles, and administrative management expenses only account for 0.13 percent of total income. The state's support for some of our loans is also borrowed in spring and repaid in autumn. All brigade cadres participate in labor, like the members, assigned people to assigned land, contracted for production, and led production from production. In 1958, the average member of the brigade worked 180 working days throughout the year. Among the 41 team cadres, 29 people worked an average of more than 150 working days per year, and 12 people worked more than 180 working days.

　　The gradual change in the poor and backward face of the Cangji Brigade is the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the strong support of the state. Without the leadership of the Party and the support of the state, we would not be able to have such a life today. At the same time, we also often combine central work and production activities to publicize the Party's policies and policies to the members, carry out mingfang debates, in order to continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the members, mobilize positive factors, overcome conservative and backward thinking and dependence on the state, establish lofty ambitions, and boost great energy, and slowly embark on a relatively prosperous road.

　　Now, the Cangji People's Commune and the Cangji Production Brigade are working hard along the direction pointed out by the Party to gradually realize agricultural mechanization, electrification, and commune industrialization, and strive for greater victories. We strive to achieve this year's yield of 700 jin per mu of three wheat, 1,000 jin of corn, 1,000 jin of seed cotton, 2,000 jin of rice, 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes, and a comprehensive leap forward in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. We will continue to implement the policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, relying on our own efforts, correctly implement the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, strengthen the production responsibility system, resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, and persevere and continue to struggle for the comprehensive realization of the various production indicators stipulated by our commune this year, and for further improving the living standards of all members of our commune.

### 由穷到富　由富更富  戴玉才代表的发言

　　由穷到富　由富更富
    戴玉才代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。现在，我就江苏省泗阳县仓集人民公社仓集大队怎样由穷变富的问题，向大会作一个发言。
    我先从仓集大队的历史谈起。这个生产大队原来是泗阳县的仓集高级农业生产合作社，现在是仓集人民公社的一个大队。这个仓集大队，像我国五亿农民曾经走过的道路一样，从个体经营到临时互助组，由临时互助组到常年互助组，由常年互助组到初级农业生产合作社，由初级农业生产合作社到高级农业生产合作社，由高级农业生产合作社到人民公社。它从一九五一年开始，走互助合作的道路，到一九五八年改组成为人民公社，足足花了九年时间。在这九年中，仓集大队在党中央和毛主席的领导下，经历了巨大的变化，一步一步地脱离了个体所有制，走向集体所有制，挖掉了穷根，发展了生产，逐步地由穷变富，并且正在向着更加富裕的日子前进。
    产量一年比一年高
    仓集大队的前身，是由十三户个体经营的农户所组成的互助组。现在已经变成为有六百三十七户、二千八百二十七人的一个生产大队。仓集大队在互助组的时候只有半头耕牛（与邻组合伙养一头牛）、一张木犁和一些刨地用的大锛，一些“兔子不拉屎”的花碱地。到现在，它有了两台拖拉机，两台播种机，一部抽水机，一部脱谷机，三十二辆胶轮平车，四辆牛车，八十多架喷雾器，二百二十七头耕畜，四百多件步犁、耙、水车、移苗器，以及四千八百四十亩经过改良的土地。
    仓集大队的公共积累是逐步增长的。互助组时只有二百多元，初级社时一千多元，高级社时六万多元，到现在，它已经有了十万多元。
    仓集大队的产量是逐年增长的。以粮食产量说，解放前和解放初期平均亩产一百斤左右，一九五二年亩产二百二十九斤，一九五三年亩产三百四十三斤，一九五四年亩产三百八十四斤，一九五五年亩产四百四十三斤，一九五六年由于遭受大水灾，亩产三百五十斤，一九五七年亩产四百八十四斤，一九五八年大跃进，亩产达到八百斤。仓集大队从一九五六年起种植棉花，当年亩产皮棉三十点五斤，一九五七年亩产八十一斤，一九五八年亩产皮棉一百八十六斤。
    生活一年比一年好
    仓集大队社员的生活是逐步提高的。解放前每人全年平均纯收入三十元左右，一九五二年三十四元，一九五三年四十元，一九五四年四十六点一元，一九五五年五十九元，一九五六年六十元，一九五七年九十元，一九五八年达到一百二十八元。合作化以前，每年春天有百分之五十的人家依靠政府救济，有些人家一年中有几个月断炊，不少人家在寒冬没有棉衣棉裤，过着糠菜半年粮的饥寒交迫的日子。合作化后，农民的生活一年比一年好，现在，人人都有棉衣棉裤，几套单衣夹衣，青壮年都有卫生衣、球鞋、胶鞋，家家有热水瓶，有二百九十户人家在银行里开户存款。公社化以后，仓集大队实行了吃饭不要钱，举办了托儿所、幼儿园、敬老院、卫生所等公共福利事业，社员的生活有了显著的改善。
    几年来，仓集大队起着深刻的巨大的变化。它由穷到富，是经过了一番艰苦奋斗的过程的。
    改造碱地洼地、水稻棉花丰收
    我们大队地处在洪泽湖以北，废黄河滩以南。碱性土质占百分之八十以上。无论种上什么庄稼，也不过收上几十斤一亩，其中低洼地又很多，十年九涝，有种无收。自从合作化以后，我们提出了“向碱地宣战，向土地要粮”的口号，采取深翻，套耕，换土和盖碱等多种方法，有计划，有步骤地彻底改良土壤。到现在，已经有百分之九十以上的碱地改变为良田，年年丰收。李庄旁边有八亩重碱地，是社员韩勤富的，因为碱性太重，他抛荒三年未种。一九五八年春季，社里组织力量，进行淤土和碱土互换，普遍换土三寸深，种上棉花，结果平均亩产皮棉二百八十八斤半。邻近梁周社有二十多亩重碱地，年年都马马虎虎种点小杂粮，产量极低。一九五八年春，梁周社一气把这块碱地送给我们，他们说：“这块地给你们吧！打十八年交单，在十八年内你们要能种好，就算你们是“好老”。”我们社员和社干，下决心要把这块土地种好，马上就组织劳动力，全部进行深翻、套耕、换土、漫河淤，种上棉花、胡萝卜等，结果亩产皮棉二百斤，胡萝卜亩产二千多斤。
    土地改良以后，我们就逐年适当扩大棉田面积，一九五八年扩种到一千四百亩，占耕地总面积百分之三十，大大增加了社员的经济收入。在将近三分之一的土地粮改棉以后，针对粮食播种面积减少的情况，我们又采取了增加粮食复种指数，提高土地利用率等措施，将耕作制从两年三熟改变为一年两熟和部分两年五熟，使粮食复种指数达到百分之二百四十二，并开垦了四百亩荒地，因此，粮田面积虽然减少，但粮食总产量却有显著增加，不但能够自给，而且有余。一九五八年春，我们又向低洼地进军，实行旱改水，可是缺乏水源，于是决定开灌溉干渠，从五河引进洪泽湖水来灌溉。当时有人说：“那有眼泪往上淌的？”但是我们下决心发动全体社员苦战，挖七万一千方土，筑成一条大干渠，叫水往高处流，真的把洪泽湖水从五河引上来。从此，碱地、洼地都被我们征服，水稻、棉花年年丰收。
    现在回想起来，当我们搞互助合作的时候，真是赤手空拳。那时，没有耕牛，没有农具，没有肥料，没有资金。这些困难，并没有吓倒我们，恰恰相反，它更加激励了我们的斗志，激发了我们摆脱贫困的决心。社员们说：“我们人穷志不穷，地孬人不孬，有党来领导，万事能做好。”我们大搞群众性的积肥运动，把仓集大街的千脚土挖有一公尺深，冬季打开泥塘冻块，戽干积水，挖起了淤黑泥，夏秋季就大搞沤堆绿肥，又发动社员养猪羊，因而施肥量一年一年增加，产量一年一年提高。我们节衣缩食，勤俭节约，从生产中逐渐扩大公共积累，把点滴资金用于生产。几年来，大队办公室和桌椅都是借用的。我们没有盖办公室、买脚踏车，行政管理经费只占总收入的百分之零点一三。国家支持我们的一部分贷款，也是春借秋还。全大队干部人人参加劳动，同社员一样，定人定地，包干包产，从生产中领导生产。一九五八年大队社员全年每人平均做一百八十个劳动日，队干部四十一人，每人每年平均做劳动日一百五十个以上的有二十九人，做一百八十个以上的有十二人。
    仓集大队能够逐步改变贫穷落后的面貌，是党的正确领导和国家大力支援的结果。如果没有党的领导和国家的支援，我们不可能有今天这样的日子。同时，我们也经常结合中心工作和生产活动，向社员宣传党的方针、政策，开展鸣放辩论，以不断提高社员的社会主义觉悟，调动积极因素，克服保守落后思想和对国家的依赖思想，立大志，鼓大劲，才慢慢走上比较富裕的道路。
    现在，仓集人民公社及仓集生产大队，正在沿着党所指引的方向，为逐步实现农业机械化、电气化和公社工业化而努力，争取更加伟大的胜利。我们力争实现今年亩产三麦七百斤，玉米一千斤，籽棉一千斤，水稻二千斤，山芋一万斤，林牧副渔全面大跃进。我们将继续贯彻勤俭办社、自力更生的方针，正确执行按劳分配、多劳多得的原则，加强生产责任制，坚决贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，苦干、实干加巧干，为全面实现我社今年所规定的各项生产指标，为进一步提高我社全体社员的生活水平，而坚持不懈，继续奋斗。
