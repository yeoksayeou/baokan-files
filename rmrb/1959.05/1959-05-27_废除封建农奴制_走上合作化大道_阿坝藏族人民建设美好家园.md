Abolish Feudal Serfdom, Embark on the Road to Cooperation: Aba Tibetan People Build a Better Home

(Our dispatch) This reporter, Zhou Zuyou, reports: The democratic reform in the rural areas of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province was completed in the spring of 1956. Peasants who had suffered exploitation and oppression for thousands of years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, immediately embarked on the cooperative road to common prosperity after the democratic reform. In just over two years, the entire prefecture achieved agricultural collectivization, and a number of people's communes were established last autumn. In 1957, the total grain output of the prefecture reached more than 209 million jin, an increase of 7% compared with 1956. Before the democratic reform, from 1949 to 1952, the total grain output of the prefecture increased by only nearly 6%. Last year, the total grain output of the prefecture leaped to more than 310 million jin, with an average of nearly 1,000 jin of grain per capita based on the agricultural population. The entire prefecture has eliminated grain-deficient households, and everyone is living a life of plenty. Now, an unprecedented production upsurge to strive for a bumper grain harvest this year is surging throughout the prefecture. The sowing of more than one million mu of land in the prefecture has been basically completed, and the sowing time is generally seven to ten days earlier than last year. More than 70% of the land is deeply plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot or more. In the past, most of the land was rarely fertilized or irrigated, but this year, the average application of base fertilizer per mu has reached 20,000 to 40,000 jin, and the area of land with water conservancy facilities has also increased to more than 230,000 mu. Last winter and this spring, agricultural implement factories were established in every township in the prefecture, manufacturing a large number of new agricultural implements such as deep plows, seeders, and hoes. The old wooden plows of "two oxen pulling a plough" have completely disappeared. In addition, farmers have also abandoned the broadcast sowing method and generally promoted advanced sowing methods such as rational close planting, wide-row strip sowing, and directional sowing. Now, from the high mountains to the river valleys, highland barley, wheat, and corn are growing very well. Tibetan farmers say that they have never seen such good crops.

In the past, all the land, forests, grasslands, and most of the draught cattle and agricultural implements here were occupied by feudal lords such as Tusi, Tuguan, and temples. Serfs could be bought, sold, given away, and slaughtered at their will. There were nearly a hundred kinds of corvée labor and rent grain pressing on the heads of serfs. Each serf household generally had to spend 50% to 70% of their time every year working as corvée labor for the feudal lords, and various rent grains often exceeded 70% of the serf's total income. Under such cruel exploitation, farmers were simply unable to develop production. In many areas, they could only use ox horns to plow the land and plant seeds blindly. The harvest for a year was only two or three times the amount of seeds sown. After liberation, although the privileges of the feudal lords were weakened and people's lives began to improve, the broad masses of the people still suffered from the cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the feudal lords. While the People's Government issued large amounts of loans, provided agricultural implements and relief funds free of charge, and helped the people solve production and living difficulties, the feudal lords took the opportunity to force rent and debts, and even embezzled them. When the People's Government led the masses to build water conservancy projects, reclaim wasteland, and develop sideline production such as beating pigs and digging medicinal herbs, the feudal lords used religious superstition to obstruct and sabotage. They also took various measures to attack and threaten activists and Tibetan cadres among the masses. More than three thousand slaves without any personal freedom lived a miserable life in darkness.

In the spring of 1956, the Aba Autonomous Prefecture completed the democratic reform. More than three thousand families, children, and the broad masses of Tibetans were allocated land and gained liberation. In order to realize the desire for common prosperity, many farmers immediately put forward the request to establish cooperatives after the democratic reform. A vigorous production upsurge emerged throughout the prefecture. Now, more than 90% of the farmers in the prefecture have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives or people's communes. Before the democratic reform, due to the feudal lords' cruel exploitation and obstruction, the water conservancy projects built each year could only irrigate a few thousand mu of land. Now, the irrigation area of the water conservancy projects built by the broad masses of farmers last year reached more than 160,000 mu, which is equivalent to twice the irrigation area of the water conservancy projects built over thousands of years. The farmers of the Shidong Cooperative in Baiwan Township, Ma'erkang County, had longed to build a ditch many years ago, but the feudal lords forbade it under the pretext of destroying the sacred mountain. After the democratic reform, the farmers organized cooperatives and realized their long-cherished wish.

    废除封建农奴制  走上合作化大道
    阿坝藏族人民建设美好家园
    本报讯  记者周祖佑报道：四川阿坝藏族自治州农村的民主改革是在1956年春天完成的。千百年来饱受剥削压迫的农民，在共产党的领导下，于民主改革后，立即走上了共同富裕的合作化大道。仅仅两年多时间，全州就实现了农业合作化，并在去年秋天建起一批人民公社。1957年，全州粮食总产量达二亿零九百多万斤，比1956年增加7％。而民主改革前，从1949年到1952年，全州粮食总产量只增加近6％。去年，全州粮食总产量更跃升到三亿一千多万斤，以农业人口计，平均每人有粮近一千斤。全州已消灭了缺粮户，人人过着丰衣足食的生活。现在，一个争取今年粮食丰收的规模空前的生产高潮，正在全州汹涌澎湃开展着。全州一百多万亩土地的播种，已经基本完成，播种时间一般比去年提早七至十天左右。70％以上的土地，深耕在八寸至一尺以上。过去绝大部分很少施肥、灌水的土地，今年每亩平均施底肥达二至四万斤，有水利设施的土地，也增加到二十三万余亩。去冬今春，全州每个乡都建立了农具厂，大量制造深耕犁、播种器、锄头等新农具。“二牛抬杠”的旧木犁，已经全部绝迹。另外，农民们还抛弃了撒播的方式，普遍推广了合理密植、宽幅条播、定向播种等先进播种方法。现在，从高山到河谷，青稞、小麦和玉米都长得很好。藏族农民说，这是从来没有见过的好庄稼。
    过去，这里全部土地、森林、草山和绝大部分耕牛、农具等都被土司、土官、寺庙等封建主占有。农奴可以被他们任意买卖、赠送和屠杀。压在农奴头上的差役和租粮，将近百种。每户农奴每年一般要用50％到70％的时间给封建主当差，而各种租粮，往往超过农奴全部收入的70％。在这样残酷的剥削下，农民们根本无力发展生产。许多地区只能用牛角耕地，白籽下种。一年的收成，只有播种量的两三倍。解放后，封建主的特权虽然有所削弱，人民生活开始得到改善，但广大人民仍受着封建主残酷的经济剥削与政治压迫。人民政府大量发放贷款、无偿发放农具和救济款，帮助人民解决生产、生活困难，封建主却趁机逼租逼债，甚至侵吞中饱。人民政府领导群众兴修水利、开荒和开展打猪、挖药等副业生产时，封建主却利用宗教迷信进行阻挠和破坏。他们还采取各种手段打击、威胁群众中的积极分子和藏族干部。三千多名毫无人身自由的奴隶，更过着暗无天日的悲惨生活。
    1956年春天，阿坝自治州完成了民主改革，三千多家人、娃子和广大藏胞，分得了土地，获得了解放。为了实现共同富裕的愿望，许多农民在民主改革之后，紧接着就提出建立合作社的要求。蓬勃的生产高潮，随着在全州各地出现。现在，全州已有90％以上的农民参加了高级农业社或人民公社。民主改革前，因为封建主的残酷剥削和多方阻挠，每年兴修的水利工程，只能增灌几千亩土地。如今，广大农民在去年兴修的水利工程灌溉面积，就达到十六万亩以上，相当于千百年来所修水利工程灌溉面积的两倍。马尔康县白湾乡石广东社的农民，多年前就渴望修条水沟，封建主却用破坏神山的罪名，加以禁止。民主改革后，农民们组织了合作社，才实现了多年的愿望。
