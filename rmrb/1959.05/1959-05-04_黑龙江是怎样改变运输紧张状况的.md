Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Fuchun and Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I will resolutely implement them.

Heilongjiang Province is a heavy industry base centered on machinery, coal, timber, and steel, and also a commodity grain production base. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the variety of industrial products increased greatly, and grain and other agricultural products had bumper harvests. By the fourth quarter of 1958, whether you went to factories, mines, forest areas, rural areas, or fields, you could see products piled up everywhere. However, due to insufficient transportation capacity, so many things could not be transported out, resulting in a "two-sided anxiety" situation. One side was in the industrial and mining areas, anxious to quickly transport the products away to free up space for continued production; in rural areas, potatoes and vegetables would freeze if not transported quickly; grain could not be stored and wasted if not transported early enough; the other side was the departments that needed these things, anxiously watching but unable to obtain them. As a result, they complained to each other and were dissatisfied with each other, sending people around to try to resolve the situation, and the situation was quite tense for a time. Obviously, the focus of the contradiction was concentrated on transportation. Therefore, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to focus on transportation work from the fourth quarter of last year, transporting large quantities of materials to various provinces and cities to support production and construction. After several months of our efforts, plus the support of the Ministry of Railways and other relevant central departments, we have basically changed the tense transportation situation. Now, I will report to the conference on the situation of the Great Leap Forward in transportation work in Heilongjiang Province:

Strengthening Leadership in Transportation Work, Mobilizing the Masses, and Tapping Transportation Potential

In order to strengthen leadership in transportation work, fully mobilize the masses, and tap transportation potential, we established more than 70 transportation command centers in the province, prefectures, cities, and counties and enterprises with large transportation volumes, and all were personally led by responsible comrades of the Party committee to provide unified leadership. The main tasks of the transportation command centers were: (1) Doing a good job of material sorting. At the beginning of the month, sort the transportation varieties and, based on the principle of guaranteeing key items and taking care of general items, and the State Economic Commission's monthly transportation arrangements, clearly stipulate what to transport more when there are more railway cars, and what to guarantee when there are fewer cars. At the same time, adjust transportation during the ten-day period according to the urgent needs of various departments for goods; (2) Launching surprise attacks on weak links and organizing comprehensive coordination, that is, under the unified organization and command of the Party committees and command centers in various places, focusing on grasping two aspects of collaboration: one is the collaboration between material consignment departments and transportation departments; the other is the comprehensive coordination between railway and road transportation departments, with the railway as the main focus; (3) Summarizing and exchanging advanced experiences to improve transportation efficiency; (4) Supervising, inspecting, and helping relevant departments solve difficulties in transportation work.

Jiamusi City has done a better job in strengthening the centralized and unified leadership of transportation work in our province. Its main practices are:

First, emphasize ideology and cooperation. Using the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters, the idea of the “sole establishment” existing in the transportation departments was resolved. This included only caring about transportation convenience and disregarding production needs, and the various departmental egoist ideas of the consigning departments only caring about supply needs and not caring about transportation difficulties, establishing the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard". In daily work, the Party organizations of transportation and consignment departments also always pay attention to conducting ideological education for employees through lectures on the situation, assignment of tasks, and visits, so the masses are full of energy. During the busiest Spring Festival transportation period, the attendance rate of loading and unloading workers in the city reached 96%, and the station operation workshop was fully staffed. In order to save transportation capacity and freight costs, the railway took the initiative to establish a freight distribution office on the wholesale station's special line to accept less-than-carload shipments, saving a large number of transfer fees and transportation capacity.

Second, open up factory boundaries and comprehensively utilize special lines. In order to solve the problem of congestion of arriving goods at the station and reduce the burden on road transportation, all 16 special lines used by various enterprises in the city were opened up, divided into six areas, and jointly used by 39 enterprises. The nearly 400 tons of goods arriving daily from the original 32 enterprises were directly distributed to the special lines near their respective units. This not only transported goods faster, but also saved an average of 50 to 60 horse-drawn carts and a large amount of loading and unloading labor every day.

Third, unify the use of labor and tools. Under the unified leadership of the city's transportation command center, four transportation command posts were established with the wood processing factory, paper mill, and railway station as the center, responsible for allocating labor and organizing loading and unloading and other specific work. Each consignment department also has a dedicated person responsible for transportation work, implementing vertical and horizontal alignment and unified allocation of manpower and material resources.

Fourth, under the principle of serving production and saving transportation capacity, the transportation department and the production department established a mutual contact system. The transportation department often grasps the production and needs of enterprises by going deep into the sites and exchanging information with various enterprises, so as to deliver vehicles in a timely manner and meet the urgent needs of consignment departments. In order to facilitate road transportation, the railway notifies the road dispatcher in advance when dropping cars. The road transport can also handle the goods loaded and unloaded by the railway according to the needs of transportation, giving priority to the main cargo, so as to collect and distribute them in a timely manner.

Due to the above measures, they completed 127.3% of the car loading plan in the first quarter, and the vehicle dwell time not only completed the plan, but also shortened month by month, completing 12.5 hours in January, 8 hours in February, and 6.5 hours in March. We are preparing to promote the experience of Jiamusi throughout the province.

In short, due to the establishment of transportation command centers at all levels, the leadership of transportation work has been strengthened, which has played an important role in fully tapping transportation potential, ensuring the transportation of major materials, and alleviating transportation tension.

Promote Advanced Experience and Vigorously Carry Out Technical Innovation in Loading and Unloading

Promote advanced experience, vigorously carry out technological innovation in loading and unloading, and tap transportation potential. Since the fourth quarter of last year, all regions and units in our province have paid attention to accelerating vehicle turnaround and carried out technical innovations in many aspects, but the loading and unloading work is basically still based on physical labor. This is difficult to sustain in a situation where all aspects require a large amount of labor, and the newly achieved results are difficult to consolidate. Therefore, in carrying out the technical innovation movement, we firmly grasped the link of reforming loading and unloading tools and equipment, and urged various places to conscientiously promote advanced experience. For example, after discovering in February that the Taoshan Quarry in Qing'an County used local methods to build a landslide-type car loading high platform with earth platforms, stones, and a small amount of wood, which increased efficiency by more than 20 times, we immediately held an on-site meeting on loading and unloading work and widely promoted it. As of the end of March, 222 high platforms of various types and 64 low cargo berths have been built in the province. After the Xingshan and Dalu mines of the Hegang Mining Bureau put the high platform into use, according to statistics for only seven days, the total car loading time in Xingshan was shortened by 2.2 hours, and the Dalu mine was shortened by 3.3 hours. Well No. 4 used to produce 2,200 tons of coal per day, and felt it was difficult to handle due to transportation conditions. Now, after building a coal storage warehouse, it produces more than 3,000 tons per day, and feels there is no problem. At the same time, the turnover of small coal cars was also accelerated. It was originally expected to add 200 small coal cars, but now not only is it not adding any, but 50 cars have been withdrawn.

The Bali Ping timber yard of the Suiyang Forestry Bureau and other places have created the experience of building high platforms for car loading by using local materials and the natural slope of the timber yard without adding any equipment. The effect is significant:

1. Reduced the labor intensity of workers and ensured the safety of loading and unloading operations. Since the implementation of high platform car loading, deaths and serious injuries have been completely eliminated.

2. Saved a lot of labor. In the past, they had more than 450 car loading and unloading workers, but they could only undertake 200,000 cubic meters of loading and unloading tasks a year. After starting to use high platform car loading last year, only 152 workers completed 260,000 cubic meters of tasks. This year, after all high platform car loading is used, although the task has increased by nearly one time, it can be guaranteed to complete the task without adding workers.

3. Compressed the car loading time and improved the utilization rate of railway vehicles. Now, each car of logs not only loads 8 cubic meters more than in the past, but also reduces the car loading time by 2 hours.

4. Saved materials such as springboards, wooden horses, large ropes, and various levers. Reduced cost. Because the high platform realizes road loading, it saves lumber wages.

Because this experience has the characteristics of high efficiency, labor saving, local materials, simple structure, not much investment, and easy organization and construction, it is generally welcomed. According to statistics on the promotion plan of various forestry departments, 608 car spaces of high platforms can be built in the province by the end of April. In this way, plus more than 400 car spaces for mechanized car loading, the province's car loading and transportation of logs can basically eliminate "grinding bones" (carrying wood with physical strength) and "stooping to hang", and greatly improve car loading efficiency.

Improve Railway Dispatching Work and Conscientiously Implement the Principle of Guaranteeing Key Items and Taking Care of General Items

In the case of insufficient railway vehicles, improving dispatching work and conscientiously implementing the principle of guaranteeing key items and taking care of general items in vehicle allocation is also an important issue. The Mudanjiang Railway Bureau has gained some preliminary experience in this regard:

The basic characteristics of freight work in the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau: First, there are many major materials. Coal accounts for 55% of the total transportation volume of the bureau, and timber accounts for 20%. The sources of goods are relatively concentrated. Second, there are few arriving goods and many outgoing goods, and it is located at the end of a remote province. The source of vehicles loaded every day mainly relies on neighboring bureaus to supply empty cars. The former is conducive to organizing large-scale collaboration between enterprises, because there are many major materials, and all parties pay attention to helping. The latter is that it cannot control the source of empty cars, and there are many major materials, making it less flexible to adjust the relationship between light and heavy, which has caused many difficulties in vehicle allocation. In response to the above situation, the Party organization of Mudanjiang Railway has conscientiously strengthened the policy and ideological education of dispatchers since the fourth quarter of last year, and constantly mobilized the masses to find ways, and gradually gained some effective measures in implementing the transportation principles of guaranteeing key items, taking care of general items, and ensuring steel with coal:

(1) Adhere to the system of formulating a monthly comprehensive transportation plan every month, and in the formulation process, in addition to absorbing relevant on-site units to participate, also send people down to organize research and solicit opinions. Therefore, the dispatchers and relevant on-site units and material consignment departments are aware of the monthly transportation work at the beginning of the month and prepare accordingly.

(2) Establish a method of compiling a daily plan with special personnel responsible and the combination of leadership, dispatching, and on-site personnel. After the car affairs, cargo source, and locomotive sections jointly review and finalize the draft, it is first issued to the main on-site units for deliberation, and then a telephone conference is held with the participation of relevant main sites to discuss and determine the next day's transportation plan, so that the plan is more realistic and the relevant sites are aware of it, which is conducive to the preparation of various tasks.

This mass line daily plan compilation method plays an important role in ensuring coal transportation, not wasting wagons, and taking care of the transportation of general materials as much as possible. At the same time, because the method of compiling the plan by a special person replaced the past method of the section dispatcher on duty following the shift to order the plan, it effectively overcame the departmentalism between shifts and sections.

Due to the above measures, the coal shipment situation of the Jixi Mining Bureau has improved month by month. In January, the daily average completion of the plan was 62.4%, in February, the daily average completion of the plan was 94.1%, and in March, the daily average completion of the plan was 99.5%, close to completing the plan.

Although we have achieved great results in transportation work in 1958, it still cannot fully adapt to the needs of national economic construction. Therefore, we must work harder and continue to go all out to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959.

Finally, let me say a few words about the Tibet issue. The traitors in Tibet, under the instigation of imperialism and Indian expansionists, launched a rebellion, betrayed national interests, sided with imperialism, and split the unification of the motherland, attempting to separate Tibet from the motherland and turn it into a foreign colony. They are the scum of the nation. Their behavior of splitting and undermining the unity and unification of all ethnic groups in the motherland has been resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The shameful conspiracy of British imperialism and Indian expansionists to use the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions will never succeed. Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times. Suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. Interfering in Tibetan affairs is interfering in China's internal affairs. The conspiracy and provocation of any imperialism and reactionary elements are destined to fail. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country will consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups, safeguard the unification of the motherland, completely quell the rebellion, eliminate all the remaining forces of imperialism and foreign reactionaries in Tibet, so that the Tibetan people can quickly embark on the road to prosperity and happiness together with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and ensure the victorious advance of the socialist construction cause.

    黑龙江是怎样改变运输紧张状况的
    李延禄代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理和富春、先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    黑龙江省是一个以机械、煤炭、木材、钢铁为中心的重工业基地，也是个商品粮生产基地，经过一九五八年大跃进，各种工业产品大量增加了，粮食和其它农产品大丰收了。到一九五八年第四季度无论走到工厂、矿山、林区、农村和田野，到处都可以看见堆满了产品。但是由于运输力不足，这样多的东西运不出去，就造成“两头着急”的情况，“一头”是在工矿林区，急于把产品快点运走，好腾出场地继续生产；在农村土豆、蔬菜如不迅速运走就会冻坏；粮食不及早运走则无处存放，糟踏损失太多；另“一头”则是需要这些东西的部门，眼看有东西拿不到手，干着急没办法。于是互相抱怨，彼此不满，派人到处活动，一时情况颇为紧张。显然矛盾的焦点集中在交通运输上，所以中共黑龙江省委决定从去年第四季度开始狠抓交通运输工作，把大量物资运往各省、市，以支援生产建设。经过我们几个月的努力，加上铁道部和中央其他有关部门，对我们的支援，目前已基本上改变了运输紧张的情况。现在我把黑龙江省组织交通运输工作大跃进的情况，向大会汇报如下：
    加强对运输工作的领导，发动群众，挖掘运输潜力
    为加强对运输工作的领导，充分发动群众，挖掘运输潜力，我们在省、地、市和运输量较大的县与企业部门建立了七十多个交通运输指挥部，并均由党委负责同志亲自挂帅，统一领导。交通运输指挥部主要工作：（一）搞好物资排队，月初在运输品种上进行排队，并根据保证重点、照顾一般的原则和国家经委对月度运输安排，明确的规定铁路车来的多时，多运甚么？车来的少时，保证什么？同时根据各部门对货源的急需情况，调整旬间运输；（二）突击薄弱环节，组织全面配合，即在各地党委和指挥部统一组织指挥下，着重抓两个方面的协作配合：一是物资托运部门与运输部门之间的协作配合；二是以铁路为主，组织铁路与公路运输部门之间的全面配合；（三）总结交流提高运输效率的先进经验；（四）督促检查和帮助有关部门解决有关运输工作中的困难。
    我省在加强对运输工作的集中统一领导方面做得较好的是佳木斯市，其主要作法是：
    第一、大抓思想，大抓协作配合。采用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，解决了运输部门存在的
  “独一处”、只顾运输方便、不管生产需要的思想和托运部门只顾供应上的需要，不关心运输困难等各种本位主义思想，树立了“全国一盘棋”的思想。在日常工作中运输与托运部门党组织，也随时注意通过讲形势，摆任务，访问等形式，向职工进行思想教育，因而群众干劲十足。在春节运输最繁重的时候，全市装卸工人出勤率达百分之九十六，车站运转车间出了满勤。为节约运力、节省运费，铁路主动地在批发站专用线成立了货运分室，接受零担货物发送，节约了大批倒运费和运力。
    第二、打开厂界，综合利用专用线。为解决车站到达货物的堵塞现象，减轻公路运输的负担，将全市企业各自使用的十六条专用线全部打开，划分六个区域，由三十九个企业共同使用。将原来三十二个企业每日平均到达的近四百多吨货物，直接分散到各该单位附近的专用线上去。这样不仅运的快，而且每天平均又节省五十至六十台马车和大量的装卸劳动力。
    第三、统一使用劳力，统一运用工具。在市交通运输指挥部的统一领导下，以木材加工厂、造纸厂、铁路车站等为中心成立四个运输指挥所，负责调配劳力和组织装卸搬运等具体工作，各托运部门也有专人负责运输工作，实行上下左右对口和统一调配人力、物力。
    第四、在为生产服务，节约运力的原则下，运输部门和生产部门建立了互相联系制度。运输部门通过深入摸点和各企业互相交底等办法，经常掌握企业的生产和需要情况，做到及时配送车，满足托运部门的急需。为便于公路运输，铁路甩车时，事前通知公路调度。公路对铁路装卸的物资，也能按运输的需要分先后主次作到及时集散。
    由于采取了上述措施，第一季度他们完成装车计划的百分之一百二十七点三，车辆停留时间不仅完成了计划，而且逐月缩短，一月份完成十二点五小时，二月份完成八小时，三月份完成六点五小时。我们正准备把佳木斯的经验在全省推广。
    总之，由于各级交通运输指挥部的建立，加强了对交通运输工作的领导，对于充分挖掘运输潜力，保证主要物资的运输，缓和运输紧张起了重要作用。
    推广先进经验，大搞装卸技术革新
    推广先进经验，大搞装卸技术革命，挖掘运输潜力。去年四季度以来我省各地区，各单位虽注意了加速车辆周转，进行了许多方面的技术革新，但在装卸工作这一环节上基本上还是靠体力劳动。这在各方面均大量需要劳力的情况下，很难持久，新取得的效果也很难巩固。为此，我们在开展技术革新运动中，紧紧地抓住了改革装卸工具和装卸设备这一环节，督促各地认真地推行了先进经验。如今年二月发现庆安县桃山采石场以土办法，用土台、石头和少量木材修建的滑坡式装车高站台，提高了效率二十多倍的经验后，我们立即召开了装卸工作现场会议，普遍加以推广。截至三月末，全省已修筑成二百二十二座各种类型的高站台和六十四座低货位。鹤岗矿务局兴山和大陆矿从高站台投入使用后，仅七天的统计，兴山装车总时间缩短了二点二十分，大陆矿缩短了三点三十分。四号井过去每天生产二千二百吨煤，由于运输条件的限制，感到很难处理。现在建起贮煤仓之后，日生产三千吨以上，反而感到没有问题了。同时还加速了小炭车的周转，原预计要增添二百辆小炭车，现在不仅不增还抽出五十辆。
    绥阳林业局八里坪贮木场等地，创造了不用增加任何设备，利用场存木材和贮木场自然坡的条件，因地制宜，就地取材，用土办法搭起高站台装车的经验，效果显著：
    1、减轻了工人的劳动强度，保证装卸作业安全。从实行高站台装车以来，根本就消灭了死亡与重伤事故。
    2、节省了大量的劳动力，过去他们的装卸车工人曾达四百五十余人，但一年仅能承担二十万立米的装卸任务。去年开始使用高站台装车后，仅用一百五十二名工人就完成了二十六万立米的任务，今年全部使用高站台装车后，任务虽然增加近一倍，不再增加工人就可以保证完成任务。
    3、压缩了装车时间，提高了铁路车辆运用率。现在每装一车原木不仅比过去多装八立米，而且还压缩装车时间二小时。
    4、节省了跳板、木马、大绳，各种杠子等材料。降低了成本费用。由于用高站台实现了连路装车，节省了归楞工资。
    因为这一经验具有效率高，省劳力，就地取材，构造简单，不用多少投资，容易组织修建等特点，受到普遍欢迎。据各林业部门推行规划统计，四月末全省可建起六百零八个车位的高站台。这样，再加机械化装车有四百多个车位，省内装运原木就可以基本上消灭“磨骨头”（用体力抬木头）和“哈腰挂”，并大大的提高装车效率。
    改进铁路调度指挥工作，切实贯彻保证重点、照顾一般的原则
    在铁路车辆不足需要的情况下，改进调度指挥工作，从车辆调配上切实的贯彻保证重点，照顾一般的原则，也是一个重要问题。牡丹江铁路局在这方面摸到了一些初步经验：
    牡丹江铁路局货运工作中的基本特点：一是主要物资多，全局总运量中煤占百分之五十五，木材占百分之二十，货源比较集中；二是到达货物少，出局货物多，而且处于边远省尽端局的位置，每天装车的车辆来源主要是靠邻局排空车供应。前者有利于组织企业间的大协作，因为主要物资多，各方面都注意帮助，后者则由于自己掌握不了空车来源，而又主要物资多，调整轻重关系上机动性小，给车辆调配上造成了许多困难。牡铁党组织针对上述情况，从去年四季度以来，认真的加强了对调度指挥人员的政策思想教育，不断的发动群众想办法，逐渐在贯彻保证重点，照顾一般，以煤保钢的运输原则上摸到了一点有效的措施：
    （一）坚持每月制订月度综合运输方案的制度，并在制订过程中除吸收有关现场单位参加外，还派人下去组织研究，征求意见。因而使调度人员和有关现场单位与物资托运部门，月初就对当月运输工作心中有数，作好准备。
    （二）建立专人负责和领导、调度、现场三结合的日间计划编制办法，经过车务、货源、机务等科室共同审查定稿后，先下达给各主要现场单位酝酿，然后召开有关各主要现场参加的电话会议，讨论确定次日运输计划，使计划定的较为切合实际，并使有关现场心中有数，有利于进行各项工作的准备。
  这种群众路线的日间计划编制方法，对既保证煤炭运输，又不浪费车皮，并尽可能的照顾一般物资的运输起了重要作用，同时因为以专人负责编制计划的办法代替了过去跟班走的区段调度值班员订计划的办法，有效的克服了班与班之间，区段与区段之间的本位主义。
    由于采取了上述措施，使鸡西矿务局的煤炭发运情况逐月好转。一月份每日平均完成计划的百分之六十二点四，二月份每日平均完成计划百分之九十四点一，三月份每日平均完成计划百分之九十九点五，接近完成计划。
    虽然我们一九五八年运输工作取得了很大成绩，但是还不能完全适应国家经济建设发展的需要，因此，我们还要加倍努力，继续鼓足干劲，为争取一九五九年更大的跃进而奋斗。
    最后，对西藏问题再说几句。西藏的卖国贼在帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的指使之下，发动了叛乱，出卖民族利益，投靠帝国主义，分裂祖国的统一，企图把西藏从祖国分裂出来，成为外国的殖民地。他们是民族的败类，他们这种分裂与破坏祖国各民族的团结和统一行为，受到了全国各族人民的坚决反对。英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子企图利用西藏叛乱事件，实现扩张野心的可耻阴谋，永远不能得逞。西藏自古以来就是中国的领土，平定西藏叛乱是中国内政，不容许外人干涉。干涉西藏事务就是干涉中国内政。任何帝国主义和反动分子的阴谋和挑衅行为，都注定是失败的。我国各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，巩固各民族的团结，维护祖国的统一，彻底平息叛乱，肃清帝国主义和外国反动派在西藏的一切残余势力，使西藏人民同祖国各族人民一道迅速走上繁荣幸福的道路，保障社会主义建设事业胜利前进。
