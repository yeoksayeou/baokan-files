World Peace and the Situation in Japan
President of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Nakajima Kenzo

"Peace" is like air and water. When the air is fresh and the water source is abundant, people forget their preciousness. With peace, we can make plans for the future and happily engage in mutual assistance and cooperation with our neighbors. National prosperity and happiness, stable and improved living standards, cultural development and popularization, and so on can only be hoped for under the condition of maintaining peace.

Once the air becomes polluted and the water source dries up, people become flustered and understand the preciousness of fresh air and abundant water sources even more. In order not to fall into such an embarrassment, we should always strive to eliminate the roots that cause air pollution and water depletion as much as possible.

The current world is at a point of divergence where the international situation is either becoming increasingly tense or somewhat easing. The ideal of world peace can only be realized when the forces of peace-loving countries defeat the imperialist attempts to expand international tensions. Currently in Japan, more and more people are striving to understand the above-mentioned international situation and to more clearly promote the fundamental principles of peace-loving. The peace-loving Japanese people oppose the Kishida Nobusuke government's blatant policy of subservience to the United States. They used their united strength to prevent the Japanese Diet from passing the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," which seriously threatens the basic human rights of the Japanese people.

In the Japanese Diet, the conservative "Liberal Democratic Party" holds a majority in terms of numbers. Therefore, if they rely on their majority in the Diet and act arbitrarily, any reactionary bill of the Kishida Nobusuke government can be passed. However, the failure of the Kishida Nobusuke government to revise the "Police Duties Law" clearly shows that if the Japanese people carry out strong opposition, even a party with a majority in the Diet cannot act arbitrarily. All strata of the Japanese people participated in this movement against the revision of the "Police Duties Law". The Japanese people also realized from the success of this movement that unity can generate great power.

Now, the Japanese House of Councillors is about to hold an election. The focus of the debate between the reformist and conservative parties in this election is whether to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" or strengthen it; whether to strive to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan, or to continue to keep the two countries in a state of hostility. This opposition is obviously the opposition between those who love peace and those who do not respect peace. The reformist parties hope to establish peaceful coexistence and friendly relations, while the conservative parties attempt to ensure the provision of military bases to the United States military.

Currently, there are still many people in Japan who do not fully understand the international situation and do not pay much attention to politics. If this middle class is not included, peace lovers far outnumber the followers of militarism. However, the politicians in the conservative camp also disguise themselves as peace lovers, attempting to divert the attention of people who are not very concerned about the international situation. They want people to forget that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a dangerous treaty for Japan. They also conceal the fact that the root cause of the unfortunate stalemate in Sino-Japanese relations lies in their policies, and instead try to shift this responsibility to China. In the past, the Japanese middle class was deceived by the Kishida Nobusuke government in this way. Therefore, the balance of political power in the Japanese Diet is favorable to the Liberal Democratic Party, a conservative party.

However, as the policies of the Kishida Nobusuke government increasingly blatantly trample on the national rights guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution, even the middle class who do not pay much attention to politics have begun to feel this danger. Because the Kishida Nobusuke government's perverse actions are becoming increasingly intensified, peace lovers urgently feel the need to strongly oppose the Kishida Nobusuke government's policies. The domestic opposition in Japan has intensified more than in the past. There is absolutely no room for compromise between peace lovers and armament expansionists. The Kishida Nobusuke government's policy is a dangerous adventure internationally and puts the people in a state of division domestically.

China and Japan are both Asian countries and have a history of friendly relations for two thousand years. However, the dangerous actions of Japanese militarists destroyed this friendly relationship and caused great damage to China and other Asian countries. Not only that, the militarists brought Japan to utter defeat and also forced the Japanese people into a tragic situation. The peace-loving Japanese people deeply feel their responsibility and strive to make the rebuilding of Sino-Japanese friendly relations their primary goal. True peace lovers long for friendship between China and Japan. People who masquerade as pacifists take an ambiguous attitude towards Sino-Japanese relations and do not want to commit to rebuilding the friendly relations between the two countries. Now, in Japan, the attitude towards Sino-Japanese relations can be said to have become a touchstone for distinguishing between true and false peace lovers.

In the late autumn of the year before last, I visited China for the first time and had the opportunity to discuss cultural exchange issues between the two countries. At that time, the purpose of cultural exchange was to deepen mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and pave the way for rebuilding friendly relations, despite the fact that the two countries had severed political relations. This summer, I am able to visit China again to discuss cultural exchange issues between China and Japan, which is something I am deeply grateful for. The Kishida Nobusuke government's wrong policies have blocked the road to restoring friendly relations between China and Japan, just like a landslide blocked it with sand and stones, and cultural exchange has also become difficult. Under this unfortunate situation, the purpose of determining cultural exchange between the two countries is even more serious than during the last discussion. I believe that cultural exchange between China and Japan should aim to restore political relations between the two countries and must be carried out as a peace-loving movement.

Compared to the situation a year and a half ago, China's Great Leap Forward is indeed amazing. As one of the Japanese who respects and loves China, I am sincerely pleased with China's achievements. The Great Leap Forward is only possible under the condition of ensuring peace. Seeing the tremendous development in Beijing, I feel even more how great the power of peace is. I urgently feel that maintaining peace is not only about loving peace, but also requires continuous efforts to eliminate the factors that threaten peace.

People's eyes are often easily deceived. Especially when they do not understand the facts and are influenced by malicious propaganda all day long, it is easier to lose the ability to make correct judgments. Now, malicious propaganda slandering China is constantly pouring into Japan from abroad. The purpose is to poison the Japanese people, deceive the Japanese people's eyes, and drag Japan into dangerous military adventures.

The achievements of the Chinese People's Commune have attracted worldwide attention. In Japan, there are also many people who are eager to understand the actual situation of the People's Commune. On the other hand, some people are carrying out malicious propaganda against the Japanese who do not understand the truth about the Tibetan rebellion. But no matter what, evil and deception will never cover up justice and truth. Striving to correctly report our observations of visiting China to the Japanese people is also my unavoidable obligation. I hope to bring back to my country as much as possible what I have learned from China during this short visit to China.

### 世界和平与日本的局势

    世界和平与日本的局势
    日中文化交流协会理事长　中岛健藏
    “和平”如同空气和水一样，在空气清爽、水源丰富的时候，人们就忘却了它们的可贵。有了和平，才能制订未来的计划，才能愉快地和近邻的人们实行互助合作。民族的繁荣和幸福、生活的安定和提高、文化的发展和普及等等都只有在维持和平的情况下，才能有所指望。
    一旦空气污浊，水源涸竭的时候，人们就狼狈起来，同时也就更加懂得清爽的空气和丰富的水源的可贵。为了不使自己陷于这样的窘境，我们就应该在平日经常努力尽一切可能来消除造成空气污浊、水源涸竭的根源。
    目前的世界正处在国际局势日趋紧张、还是多少趋向缓和的分歧点。只有在爱好和平各国的力量打垮了帝国主义企图扩大国际紧张局势的阴谋时，世界和平的理想才能实现。目前在日本，有越来越多的人力求了解上述国际形势和更加明确地推进爱好和平的根本原则。爱好和平的日本人民反对岸信介政府的露骨的屈从美国的政策。他们以团结起来的力量阻止了日本国会通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。这一法案严重地威胁着日本人民的基本人权。
    在日本的国会内，保守政党的“自由民主党”在数量上占多数。因此，倘依靠在国会内的多数势力蛮干的话，岸信介政府的任何反动法案都是可以通过的。但是，岸信介政府修改“警职法”的失败，清楚地说明如果日本人民进行强烈的反对，即使是在国会拥有多数的政党也不能任意而行。日本的各阶层人民，都参加了这个反对修改“警职法”的运动。日本人民，也从这次运动的成功中体会到团结就能产生伟大的力量。
    现在，日本参议院就要举行选举了。在这次选举中革新政党和保守政党双方争论的焦点，在于是废除日美“安全条约”，还是加强这个条约；是努力恢复中日两国邦交，还是继续使两国处于敌对状态。这种对立，显然就是爱好和平同不尊重和平的对立。革新政党希望建立和平共处和友好关系，而保守的政党则企图保证向美国军队提供军事基地。
    目前，在日本还有许多人不十分了解国际局势，不太关心政治。如果，不把这种中间阶层计算在内，和平爱好者在数量上要远远超过军国主义的追随者。但是，保守势力营垒中的政客们，也把自己打扮成和平爱好者的样子，企图转移对国际局势不太关心的人们的注意力。让人们忘掉日美“安全条约”对日本说来是一种危险的条约。他们并且隐瞒中日关系陷于停顿的不幸局面的根源在于他们的政策这一事实，反过来力图把这种责任推到中国头上。过去，日本的中间阶层是受了岸信介政府的这种欺骗的。因此，在日本国会内的政治力量对比，对保守政党的自由民主党有利。
    但是，由于岸信介政府的政策日益露骨地蹂躏日本宪法所保证的国民权利，连不大关心政治的中间阶层也开始感到这种危险了。因为岸信介政府的倒行逆施日益变本加厉，和平的爱好者迫切感到有必要对岸信介政府的政策进行强烈的反对。日本国内的对立比过去激化了。在和平爱好者和军备扩张论者之间，决无妥协的余地。岸信介政府的政策在国际上是一种危险的冒险行动，在国内则使国民陷于分裂的局面。
    中国和日本同是亚洲国家，而且拥有二千年的友好历史。但是，日本军国主义者的危险行动破坏了这种友好关系，并使中国以及其他亚洲各国遭到了巨大的损害。不但如此，军国主义者并弄得日本一败涂地，也迫使日本人民陷于悲惨的境地。爱好和平的日本人民，深感自己所负的责任，要把重建中日友好关系作为首要目标，努力奋斗。真正的和平爱好者都渴望中国和日本的友好。冒充和平主义者的人，在日中关系上采取暧昧的态度，不想致力于重建中日两国友好关系。现在，在日本，对日中关系的态度可以说是成了辨别和平爱好者真伪的试金石。
    前年秋末，我第一次来中国进行访问，获得了一个就两国文化交流问题进行商讨的机会。当时文化交流的目的是，尽管两国在政治上断绝关系，然而可以通过文化交流加深两国人民的相互了解，为重建友好关系开辟道路。今年夏初我能以再度访问中国，就中日两国文化交流问题进行商讨，这是值得我深深感激的事情。岸信介政府的错误政策，使恢复中日两国友好关系的道路，像发生山崩那样为砂石所堵塞，文化交流也发生了困难。在这种不幸的状况下，确定两国文化交流的目的也比上一次商讨的时候更加严重了。我认为中日两国的文化交流，应该以恢复两国的政治关系为目的，并且必须作为一种爱好和平的运动来进行。
    比起一年半以前的情况，中国的大跃进的确是惊人的。我作为敬爱中国的日本人之一，对中国的这种成就感到衷心的欣慰。大跃进只有在确保和平的条件下才是可能的。我看到北京的巨大发展，就越发感到和平力量是多么伟大。我迫切感到要维护和平就不仅是爱好和平，并且需要不断地努力来铲除威胁和平的因素。
    人们的眼睛，常常容易受到蒙蔽。尤其是在不了解实情，整天受到恶意宣传的影响时，就更容易丧失正确的判断能力。现在，诬蔑中国的恶意宣传，正源源不绝地从国外流入日本。其目的是要毒化日本人民，蒙蔽日本人民的眼目，把日本拖入危险的军事冒险行动。
    中国人民公社的成就，引起了全世界的注意。在日本也有很多人渴望了解人民公社的实际情况。另一方面，有人正在对不了解西藏叛乱真相的日本人进行心怀恶意的宣传。但是，无论怎样，邪恶和欺骗终归掩盖不了正义和真理。力求正确地向日本国民报告我们访问中国的见闻，也是我的责无旁贷的义务。我想经过这次短短的访问中国的时间，尽可能多地把从中国学习到的东西带回我的祖国。
