Two or Three Things About "Careful Planning and Decisive Action"
By Our Reporter Deng Guoxiang

How can grassroots cadres lead production effectively? In leading production, how can work be done "step by step" and become more solid and meticulous? With these questions in mind, I recently visited the cadres of the Qunfeng Production Brigade of the Dongpu Commune in Heyuan County, Guangdong Province. There, I heard several "small stories" of great significance.

Careful Planning and Decisive Action, Decisive Action at the Right Moment

At the beginning of the spring planting season, the transplanting speed of this production brigade was very slow. The cadres went deep among the masses to investigate and found that many people were not very satisfied with the dense planting specifications set by the commune this year—one by four, two by four, and two by five. Therefore, on April 3rd, a symposium was held to solicit everyone's opinions on the dense planting specifications. Liao Luotian, the Party Branch Secretary, said to everyone: "The specifications for transplanting were determined earlier. Although everyone studied them at the time, we did not do enough to extensively and deeply solicit the opinions of the masses. Now, let's see how densely everyone thinks is reasonable to plant?" Liao Xinping said: "I think the cadres can decide." Liao Luotian said: "No, how much to plant should be studied and decided by everyone." However, not many people expressed their opinions.

In order to encourage everyone to speak, Liao Luotian picked up the People's Daily editorial "On Rational Close Planting" and read it carefully to the commune members. Then, everyone started talking. Liao Xinping said: "In my opinion, this year's transplanting should not be as dense as in the past, otherwise the seedlings will lodge, and there will be no guarantee of achieving the planned yield." Yin Shigui said: "Yes, this year's planting is too dense. I say two by five is good. Last year, we planted the most using this specification, and as a result, our production team overfulfilled the contracted production task in the late rice crop." Yin Shigui's opinion was endorsed by some people. But Yin Shijin believed that it would be even better if it were a little sparser, planted at three by five. Many old farmers felt that both specifications were good.

After opening up channels for discussion, everyone freely expressed their unique views. Liao Xinping put forward his suggestion: "I think seven by six is the best planting specification, and the densest should only be six by five." He added: "According to my experience of planting rice for over sixty years, the fields here (he pointed to a large area of land outside), used to be planted at eight by six to six by five. Without applying much fertilizer and without deep plowing, they grew very well, yielding three to four hundred catties per mu. Now that we have accumulated so much fertilizer and have carried out deep plowing, if we plant according to the past specifications, the rice stalks will definitely grow as thick as fingers. If we plant so densely now, the stalks will only be as thin as incense sticks." Some people disagreed with his opinion, and a free-wheeling debate ensued. Yin Shijin said:

"Uncle Xinping, what you are saying is not true. The currently stipulated specifications are indeed too dense, but returning to the sparse planting of seven by six that you mentioned, the facts of the past few years have proven that it will not increase rice yields. Last year, all of our land in the Hengpai area was planted at three by five, and it was not like the incense sticks you mentioned. These rice plants grew very well, did not lodge, and one cut with the sickle yielded a large bundle, the stalks were so thick that you had to clench your teeth to cut a bundle. These more than thirty mu of land yielded an average of more than one thousand catties per mu, with the highest yielding more than one thousand four hundred catties." Yin Shijin's words were endorsed by most people because he was stating facts that everyone knew.

Through analyzing and comparing various opinions in the discussion, most people believed that it would be more reasonable to plant at two by five, two and a half by five, or three by five specifications according to different fields.

The Party Branch studied these opinions of the masses and thought they were very correct. The specifications should be denser than the early rice crop last year, and sparser than the late rice crop last year (the local late rice crop last year was planted too densely).

Because the newly determined specifications met the wishes of the masses, the transplanting speed greatly accelerated. The daily transplanting progress of the entire brigade increased from about eighty mu to more than two hundred mu, with a maximum of three hundred and ten mu. As a result, transplanting was completed half a month earlier than last year. The commune members were very satisfied with the brigade leaders' patience in listening to the opinions of the masses. Female commune member Pan Ya'si said to Liao Luotian: "Secretary Liao, it would be great to have more of these symposiums in the future. With communication between higher and lower levels, and everyone working together, we will definitely be able to overfulfill the production increase plan this year!"

Adapting to Local Conditions, Differentiating Treatment

When the early rice transplanting ended and turned to field management, the CPC Shaoguan Prefectural Committee required the promotion of the automatic irrigation and drainage method created by Zhang Xianchang throughout the region. The cadres of the Qunfeng Production Brigade carefully studied this experience and believed that it was indeed an advanced experience worthy of serious promotion, and decided to promote it throughout the brigade. In the process of promotion, it was found that commune members had differing opinions: some agreed, and some opposed. This situation immediately aroused the attention of the Party Branch Committee, which specially convened a symposium of agronomists to study the relevant issues of promoting this advanced experience. At the meeting, the agronomists enthusiastically expressed their views. They reflected the reasons for some commune members' emotional resistance to the promotion of this experience. It turned out that to implement Zhang Xianchang's automatic irrigation and drainage method, it was necessary to dig ditches in the fields; but now that the seedlings had been transplanted, digging ditches would require removing three rows of rice seedlings. As a result, some commune members felt heartache. They said: "One rice plant is worth three catties of grain, how much grain will be lost by removing three rows of seedlings!" Therefore, they advocated not implementing automatic irrigation and drainage for the early rice crop, but waiting until the second half of the year to do it. However, agronomist Xie Yigui believed that Zhang Xianchang's automatic irrigation and drainage method was indeed a good method that could save labor, preserve warmth and fertilizer, and should still be promoted. At the meeting, many people agreed with Xie Yigui's view, affirming that this was an advanced experience; everyone weighed the pros and cons and believed that they should not lose sight of the big picture for the sake of small gains, and should address the ideological problems of the commune members to make everyone understand the benefits of ditching for automatic irrigation and drainage.

However, should this experience be promoted on all rice fields? At the meeting, the agronomists put forward different opinions. Li Ya'ren of the Sixth Team said: "This experience is very good, but it should be promoted in a way that suits local conditions. We have many mountain valley fields here, these fields do not have long-running water, and forcing the installation of automatic irrigation and drainage equipment, even if it is done well, will not achieve the desired effect. The conditions are not yet in place to promote this advanced experience in this type of field." Yin Shigui of the Fourth Squad also agreed with Li Ya'ren's opinion, and he added: "There are also some fields that have not been leveled after deep plowing, and automatic irrigation and drainage cannot be promoted in early rice fields. Because the field soil is uneven, the field water cannot flow smoothly, and it will not be very effective. In the late rice crop, we will fully prepare, and it can be fully promoted."

When these opinions were put forward, everyone felt that they made sense, and they all believed that the steps of promotion should be adapted to local conditions. On the spot, everyone ranked the brigade's more than 1,600 mu of rice fields and determined that more than 840 mu could promote Zhang Xianchang's gravity irrigation and drainage method, and the rest would be promoted in the late rice crop. The revised promotion plan was unanimously supported by the masses. This fact once again made the cadres realize the profound significance of the mass line.

Communicating with Others, Choosing the Good and Following It

Frequently communicating with others, listening to various different opinions among the masses, adopting the reasonable parts, and making correct decisions, this is the working method often used by Party Branch Secretary Liao Luotian.

One day, Liao Luotian and old farmer Yang Chuannv squatted next to an experimental field chatting idly. Liao Luotian said to Yang Chuannv: "Look, how is this strip-sown experimental field growing?" Yang Chuannv shook her head and said: "The rice looks very lush, but I guarantee there will be no good harvest, I dare to bet! Secretary Liao, if there is a good harvest, I will give you my half-year's salary." Liao Luotian asked anxiously: "Why?" Yang Chuannv replied unhurriedly: "The strip-sown experimental field you made is too dense, the seedlings will seal the rows as soon as they tiller, the weak seedlings, and the ineffective tillers will absorb the fertilizer, and in the end, you will only be able to harvest a large handful of grass." Liao Luotian asked:

"According to you, what should be done?" Yang Chuannv said: "There are three remedies: First, pull out one row of rice seedlings from every two rows, and the remaining strip-sown rice seedlings in each row should also be thinned out, so that the harvest can be guaranteed. Second, the rice roots should be broken with the feet to prevent them from growing in vain. Third, do not dry the fields, drying the fields will weaken the rice seedlings and ruin them." When Liao Luotian heard this suddenly, he thought that these suggestions could not be adopted. Later, he thought about it carefully and felt that it was not entirely the case. Although the specific methods proposed by this old farmer could not be fully implemented, they reflected noteworthy issues, and there were reasonable and acceptable parts in the opinions. He accepted Yang Chuannv's opinion that excessive density was harmful; but he wanted to adopt a method of thinning out the weak and retaining the strong, reducing the 1.1 million seedlings to 650,000 seedlings, instead of pulling out one row of rice seedlings from every two rows as he said, and then thinning out each row (which would remove three-quarters of the rice seedlings regardless of whether they were good or bad, and would turn into sparse planting with row spacing of eight or nine inches). He thought that Yang Chuannv's proposed methods of not drying the fields and breaking the rice roots were not feasible. But these incorrect suggestions reminded him to pay attention to preventing lodging as soon as possible. He considered: In order to squat the seedlings and prevent lodging, it is not necessary to break the rice roots, and it is still necessary to dry the fields and cultivate the soil appropriately and timely. After he improved it in this way, the rice seedlings grew even better.

Liao Luotian is like this, often going to the fields to chat with some of the masses, soliciting their opinions on work and production measures, and obtaining many good ideas. Recently, before formulating a complete set of field management measures, he visited seven field administrators, old farmers, and technicians, and together with them analyzed the characteristics of rice seedling growth and discussed measures for cultivating, fertilizing, and managing. Of course, the opinions of the masses will not be completely consistent, there will be differences and disputes, which is common. For example, there were different views on whether early rice should be dried in the field. Four of the seven people thought that the rice seedlings would not grow well if the early rice fields were dried, and three people thought that drying the fields could prevent lodging. After the debate, all aspects of the contradiction were fully exposed, and various possible solutions to the contradiction were put forward, so that leaders and the masses could choose the good and follow it from various opinions. The result of this discussion was that the majority accepted the correct opinions of the minority, the correct opinions of the minority became the opinions of the majority, and the correct decision was made to dry the fields appropriately.

    “多谋善断”二三事
    本报记者  邓国庠
    基层干部怎样才能够领导好生产？在领导生产中，如何使工作做到“一步一个脚印”，越做越踏实细致呢？记者带着这些问题，最近访问了广东省河源县东埔公社群峰生产大队的干部。在那里，我听到了几个有重大意义的“小故事”。
    多谋善断  当机立断
    在春耕插秧开始的时候，这个生产大队插秧速度很慢。干部深入群众作了调查，发觉不少人对社里规定的今年的密植规格——一乘四、二乘四和二乘五不很满意。于是，便在4月3日召开了一个座谈会，征求大家对密植规格的意见。党总支书记廖罗添对大家说：“插秧的规格是以前定下来的，当时虽然经过大家研究，但是广泛深入地征求群众意见还做得不够。现在看看大家认为插得多密才合理？”廖新平说：“我看干部决定就可以了。”廖罗添说：“不，要插多少，应该由大家来研究决定。”但是，大家谈的意见还是不多。
    廖罗添为了启发大家发言，便拿起人民日报“论合理密植”的社论向社员们细细地读了一遍。接着，大家就谈开了。廖新平说：“依我看，今年插秧，不要插得像过去那么密，否则禾苗要倒伏，要达到计划产量就没有把握。”殷石桂说：“是呀，今年插得过分密了，我说插二乘五好。去年，我们用这种规格插的最多，结果，我们生产队晚造超额完成了包产任务。”殷石桂提出的意见，很得到一部分人的赞同。但殷石金认为，再疏一点，插到三乘五更合他的心意。许多老农都觉得这两种规格都不错。
    广开言路之后，大家都畅怀发挥自己的独特见解。廖新平提出他的主张：“我认为插七乘六最好，最密也只能插到六乘五。”他又补充说：“据我种了六十多年田的经验，这里的田（他指向室外一大片土地），过去插的是八乘六至六乘五，没有下什么肥，也从未深耕过，但长得很好，每亩收割三、四百斤。现在肥料积了这末多，又进行过深翻，如果按过去那样的规格插秧，禾秆肯定生得指头那么粗。现在插得那样密，秆身只有香枝骨那么细。”有人不同意他的意见，于是展开了畅所欲言的争论。殷石金说：
  “新平伯，你讲的不是真实话。现在规定的规格的确是过密了，但是退回到你所说的七乘六的疏植，几年来的事实证明是不能多收稻谷的。去年我们横排那里，全部插的是三乘五，却不是你说的像香枝骨。这些禾长的很好，没有倒伏，割两镰就有一大扎，秆子粗壮得要咬紧牙根才割得断一捆。这三十多亩田，平均每亩得到一千多斤产量，最高的有一千四百多斤。”殷石金的话，得到多数人的赞同，因为他说的是人人皆知的事实。
    大家在讨论中对多方面意见分析、比较，大都认为按照不同的田插二乘五、二点五乘五、或三乘五的规格比较合理。
    党总支部研究了群众这些意见，认为很对。规格应该比去年早造加密，比去年晚造稀些（当地去年晚造植得过于密了）。
    由于新定的规格合了群众的心，插秧速度大大加快了，全大队每天插秧进度由八十来亩增加到了二百多亩，最高达到三百一十亩。结果，比去年提早半个月插完秧。社员们对大队领导干部这样耐心地倾听群众意见，感到非常满意。女社员潘亚四对廖罗添说：“廖书记，今后多开这样的座谈会好哇，上下通气，大家筹谋，今年一定可以超额完成增产计划！”
    因地制宜  区别对待
    在早稻插秧结束转向田间管理的时候，中共韶关地委要求在全区推广张先昌创造的自动排灌法。群峰大队的干部仔细地研究了这个经验，认为的确是一个值得认真推广的先进经验，决定在全队推广。在推广过程中，发现社员意见纷纷：有的人赞成，有的人反对。这情况立刻引起了党总支委员的注意，便专门召开农艺师座谈会，研究推广这个先进经验的有关问题。会上，农艺师们热烈地各叙己见。他们反映了有些社员对推广这个经验情绪上抵触的原因。原来实行张先昌的自动排灌法，是要在田里开沟的；但现在秧苗已插下，要开沟就得铲掉三行禾苗。这样，一些社员就觉得心痛。他们说：“一株禾三斤谷，三行禾苗要去掉多少谷呀！”因此，他们主张早造不实行自动排灌，到下半年才搞。不过，农艺师谢宜贵认为，张先昌的自动排灌法的确是个好办法，能够节省劳力，保温、保肥，还是应该推广的。会上，许多人都赞同谢宜贵的看法，肯定了这是个先进经验；大家权衡了利害轻重，认为不能因小失大，要针对社员的思想问题，使人人了解开沟自动排灌的好处。
    但是，是否在全部稻田上推广这个经验呢？在会上农艺师们提出了不同的意见。第六队的李亚仁说：“这个经验很好，但是要因地制宜地推广。我们这里山坑田很多，这些田没有长流水，硬搞自动排灌设备，搞好也起不到应有的作用。要在这类田推广这个先进经验，条件还不具备。第四小队的殷石桂也同意李亚仁的意见，他还补充说：“还有一些深翻以后没有耙平的田，在早造田也还不能推广自动排灌。因为田土忽高忽低，田水还不能自流通畅，搞了作用也不大。到晚造我们充分做好准备工作，这是可以全部推广的。”
    这些意见摆了出来，大家都觉得有道理，都认为在推广的步骤上要因地制宜。当场大家把全队的一千六百多亩稻田排了一下，确定有八百四十多亩可以推广张先昌的自流排灌法，其他的到晚造再推广。经过修改后的推广计划，受到群众的一致拥护。这件事实，又一次使干部认识到走群众路线的深刻意义。
    与人通气  择善而从
    经常与人通气，倾听群众中间各种不同的意见，采纳合理的部分，作出正确的决定，这是党总支书记廖罗添经常采用的工作方法。
    一天，廖罗添和老农杨船女蹲在一块试验田旁边闲拉话。廖罗添对杨船女说：“你看，这块条播试验田长得怎样？”杨船女摇摇头说：“禾面葱绿得很，但保证没有好收成，我敢打赌！廖书记，如果有好收成，我的半年工资送给你。”廖罗添急着问：“为什么？”杨船女不快不慢地回答说：“你搞的这块条播试验田，密的太不像话了，禾苗一分蘖就封了行，弱苗，无效分蘖的禾把肥料吸去了，到头来你就只能割得一大把草。”廖罗添问：
  “依你说，该怎么办呢？”杨船女说：“补救办法有三条：第一，两行禾苗拔掉一行，余下的每行条播禾苗也要拔稀，这样，收成就能保险。第二，禾根要用脚踩断，不让它徒长。第三，不要晒田，一晒田禾苗就要弱，会坏。”廖罗添骤然听到的时候，认为这些建议都是不可以采纳的。后来，他再细细地想想，觉得不完全是这样。这位老农提出的具体办法，虽然不可以完全照办，但是却反映出了值得注意的问题，意见中也有合理的可取的部分。他接受了杨船女提出过密有害的意见；但要采取去弱留强的间苗办法，把一百一十万苗减为六十五万苗，而不是照他说的那样两行禾苗拔一行，每行再拔稀些（那样会不分良莠地去掉四分之三的禾苗，而且会变成八、九寸行距的疏植了）。对杨船女提出不晒田、踩断禾根的办法，他认为是行不通的。但是这些不正确的建议，却提醒了他注意及早防倒伏的问题。他考虑：为了蹲苗防倒不必踩断禾根，适时适当地晒田和培土还是必要的。他照这样改进了以后，禾苗生长得果然更好了。
    廖罗添就是这样，常常到田头找些群众谈心，征求群众对工作和生产措施的意见，得到了许多良策。最近，在制定整套的田间管理措施之前，他就访问了七位田间管理员、老农和技术员，同他们一道分析禾苗生长的特点，商讨出中耕、施肥、管理的措施。当然，群众的意见不会完全一致，有分歧，也有争论，这是常有的事。例如对于早稻要不要晒田的问题，看法就不一致。七个人中有四个人认为早稻晒田禾苗不好生长，有三个人认为晒田可以防倒伏。经过争论，充分暴露了矛盾的各个侧面，提出了各种可能解决矛盾的对策，就使得领导干部和群众能够从各种意见中择善而从。这次讨论的结果是多数人接受了少数人的正确意见，少数人的正确意见变成了多数人的意见，作出了要适当晒田的正确决定。（附图片）
