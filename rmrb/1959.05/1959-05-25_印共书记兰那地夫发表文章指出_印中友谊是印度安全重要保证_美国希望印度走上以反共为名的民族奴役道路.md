Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 24th. "New Century" magazine published an article in its May issue written by Ranadive, Secretary of the National Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party of India. The author emphasized that "at a time when Western imperialism, especially US imperialism, is trying its best to split Asia and control weaker countries, India's relationship with China plays an extremely important role in defending the freedom and peace of the Asian continent." He said, "The attitude adopted by some people in our country on the Tibet issue is no longer a small matter, but has become a serious one."

Ranadive said, "The conclusion of the US-Pakistan treaty, the shooting down of an Indian Canberra-style aircraft, the continued arming of Pakistan, and the refusal of US authorities to deny Pakistan's claim that military aid provided under this treaty would be used against India—all of this clearly shows which forces are threatening India's security. The Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty once again show that US imperialism has become the reactionary gendarme of Asia, attempting to control and enslave countries one by one, and pursuing the notorious policy of making Asians fight Asians."

He added, "In this situation, Sino-Indian friendship, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit of friendship among Asian countries, has become the greatest guarantee of peace and freedom in Asia, as well as India's security and autonomy. The friendship between India and our neighbor China is extremely important for our security; anyone who treats this friendship lightly is committing a crime against our security, our people, and our country. However, since some events in Tibet, even some people in our government have begun to increasingly emphasize 'national security' on the northern border, as if the danger threatening our country comes from China."

Ranadive pointed out, "This is precisely the idea that imperialists want us to have." He said, "US imperialists are using the fear of socialism among reactionary ruling groups—certain capitalists and landlords—in newly liberated countries, attempting to drag them into their military treaties in the name of protecting national security."

Ranadive said, "If freedom-loving countries in Asia have expressed concern about certain statements by the Indian government, the reactionary ruling group in Pakistan, like their American masters, are very happy and have repeatedly expressed their willingness to establish a joint defense of the subcontinent to deal with communism, to deal with China. This is a joint defense under American control." He said that Pakistan's suggestion of "joint defense" is "actually a suggestion from the United States. Of course, this is not the path Mr. Nehru wants to take—the path of national enslavement in the name of anti-communism, the Pakistani path."

Ranadive said that the Tibet incident has also caused those forces in Indian national life that have never approved of India's independent foreign policy, have consistently attempted to turn the Indian people against socialist countries, and have turned it towards imperialism, to raise their heads. He pointed out that among this miserable group of forces are the People's Socialist Party, the leading organs of the People's League, and a section of the Congress Party leaders. It is these elements who, with the support of the reactionary press, are playing a leading role in undermining Sino-Indian relations, and are still trying to prevent the restoration of old friendly relations and to bury the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence from now on.

Ranadive wrote: "Can it be said that we are defending a great cause, while the Chinese People's Government and the entire Chinese people have violated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, violated solemn guarantees, and violated the sacred principles of freedom? First of all, it should be recognized that this crisis was not caused by any action taken by China against India."

Referring to the interference in China's internal affairs by certain political figures in India using the Tibetan rebellion incident, Ranadive said, "Should we teach China how to handle its internal affairs, sympathize with those who take up arms against the Chinese government, and attack People's China for violating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?!" He said that some people in India, without any international authority, speak as if they are the protectors of Tibetan autonomy (as they understand it), although India has no say in the Tibet issue.

Ranadive repeatedly emphasized that the Indian government has no right to interfere in Tibetan affairs, and India is not the guarantor of Tibetan autonomy. Ranadive then quoted the agreement between the Chinese Central Government and the Tibetan Local Government on the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951. He pointed out that according to this agreement, Tibet is a part of China; the Tibetan nationality is one of China's many nationalities, its autonomy should be implemented under the leadership of the Central Government, and Tibet's foreign affairs should be managed by the Central Government. If there is any dispute between the central and local governments regarding this agreement, it should be decided by the Chinese government and Chinese and Tibetan (local) public opinion, and not by others. The local government exercises its functions under the leadership of the central government, and no foreign government can claim the right to speak on behalf of Tibetan autonomy.

He said that this status of Tibet is recognized by the Indian government; this can be clearly seen from the fact that the 1954 agreement between China and India on trade and traffic between the Tibetan region of China and India was not signed by the Indian government and the Tibetan local government, but by the Indian government and the People's Chinese government. India not only recognized China's sovereignty over Tibet, but the fact that the 1954 agreement was only signed with the Central People's Government also shows that the 1951 agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet was also recognized. And that agreement certainly gives India no right to interfere as the protector of Tibet.

Ranadive said, "What some people in India are advocating in the name of autonomy is the secession of Tibet from China. Some people are trying to play a trick, equating independence with autonomy, and then, if the Chinese fight back, they complain."

Ranadive also said that the People's Socialist Party's "Asoka Mehta and Prakash and others have been propagating that Tibet's individuality has been destroyed. What exactly is this Tibetan way of life? What exactly is this Tibetan individuality?" He then analyzed the social structure of Tibet and described the miserable life of serfs. He said, "When the anti-communist leaders of the People's Socialist Party, the reactionaries of the Indian People's League, and the countless brands of 'socialists' in this country attack China, they are defending the Tibet of the serf owners. Which farmer, which worker in India sympathizes with them? Defending the serf system is defending the ignorance imposed on the masses under the rule of the lamas. Superstition, ignorance, spiritual atrophy, and the lack of personal development are the result of lama rule, and this rule is what our 'socialists' want to maintain."

Ranadive said, "The idea that our national security is threatened by the advancement of socialism, by the rise of democratic and socialist countries on our border, is a class concept borrowed from imperialists. The workers, peasants, and other ordinary people of our country have nothing to fear from the socialism that is developing on our border. They will certainly welcome it as a further victory for the cause they are committed to."

Ranadive pointed out, "India's national security is not, and cannot be, based on the backwardness of Tibet, forcing Tibet to remain in the medieval stage, attempting to separate it from China, and demanding that the pace of Tibetan reform be slowed down. Without a doubt, India's security will be strengthened by the friendly understanding between socialist China and independent India, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the common desire to resist imperialism everywhere. Because Sino-Indian friendship is one of the greatest guarantees of our security. It is indispensable for both India and the Chinese people. It is the foundation of freedom and peace in Asia."

Ranadive believes that Nehru is a co-sponsor of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and he has accepted these principles in India's relations with China. It is essential to reaffirm the Five Principles and restore warm friendly relations between China and India for the common security and freedom of both countries.

    印共书记兰那地夫发表文章指出
    印中友谊是印度安全重要保证
    美国希望印度走上以反共为名的民族奴役道路
    新华社新德里24日电　“新世纪”月刊在5月份的一期上刊载了印度共产党全国委员会书记处书记兰那地夫所写的一篇文章，作者强调指出，“在西方帝国主义、尤其是美帝国主义竭力试图分裂亚洲、控制较弱小国家的情况下，印度同中国的关系在保卫亚洲大陆的自由及和平方面起着极为重要的作用。”他说，“我国某些人士在西藏问题上所采取的态度已经不再是一件小事，而是已成为一桩严重的事情了。”
    兰那地夫说，“缔结美巴条约、印度堪培拉式飞机被击落、继续武装巴基斯坦、美国当局拒绝否认巴基斯坦所谓根据这个条约所提供的军事援助将用来反对印度的说法——所有这一切都清楚地说明是哪些力量威胁着印度的安全。巴格达条约和东南亚条约再一次表明：美帝国主义已经成为亚洲的反动宪兵，它企图一个接一个地控制和奴役各个国家，它奉行着叫亚洲人打亚洲人的臭名远扬的政策。”
    他又说，“在这种情况下，以遵守潘查希拉原则和亚洲各国友好的万隆精神为基础的印中友谊，成了亚洲的和平和自由以及印度的安全和自主的最大保证。印度和我们的邻国中国的友谊对于我们的安全是极为重要的；谁要是轻率地对待这种友谊，那就是对我们的安全、我们的人民和我们的国家的一种犯罪行为。但是，自从西藏的一些事件发生以来，甚至我们政府中的一些人也开始越来越多地强调北部边境方面的‘国家安全’，好像威胁着我国安全的危险来自中国。”
    兰那地夫指出，“这恰恰就是帝国主义者希望我们抱有的想法。他说，“美帝国主义者利用新近解放的国家中反动统治集团——某些资本家和地主——对社会主义的恐惧心理，企图借保护国家安全为名，把它们拉入他们的军事条约。”
    兰那地夫说：“如果说亚洲爱好自由的国家对印度政府的某些言论表示了忧虑的话，巴基斯坦的反动统治集团却像它们的美国主子一样感到很高兴，并且一再表示愿意建立次大陆的共同防御来对付共产主义，对付中国，这就是在美国控制下的共同防御。”他说，巴基斯坦关于“共同防御”的建议，“实际上是一项来自美国的建议。当然，这不是尼赫鲁先生想走的道路——即以反共为名的民族奴役的道路，巴基斯坦式的道路。”
    兰那地夫说：西藏事件也促使印度国家生活中那些从来就不赞成印度独立外交政策、一贯企图使印度人民反对社会主义国家并且使它转向帝国主义的势力抬起了头。他指出，属于这一堆可悲的势力的有人民社会党、人民同盟的领导机构和国大党的一部分领导者。正是这些分子在反动报界的支持下在损害中印关系方面起着主导作用，并且仍在竭力企图使旧的友好关系得不到恢复，使潘查希拉原则从此葬送。
    兰那地夫写道：“是不是可以说，我们在保卫一个伟大的事业，而中国人民政府和全体中国人民则违背了潘查希拉，违背了庄严的保证和自由的神圣原则？首先应该认识到，这个危机的产生并不是由于中国对印度采取了什么行动。”
    在谈到印度某些政界人士利用西藏叛乱事件干涉中国内政时，兰那地夫说，“难道我们应该去教中国如何处理它的内部事务，应该去同情拿起武器来反对中国政府的那些人，并且攻击人民中国违反潘查希拉？！”他说，印度有些人竟然在毫无任何国际权力的情况下俨然以西藏自治（他们所理解的自治）的保护者的身份讲话，虽然印度在西藏问题上没有任何发言权。
    兰那地夫一再强调说，印度政府无权干涉西藏事务，印度也不是西藏自治的保证人。兰那地夫接着引证1951年中国中央政府和西藏地方政府签订的关于和平解放西藏的协议。他指出，根据这项协议，西藏是中国的一部分；西藏民族是中国许多民族之一，它的自治应当在中央政府的领导下实行，西藏的对外事务应当由中央政府管理。如果中央和地方政府之间对于这个协议有任何争执，那是应该由中国政府和中国及西藏（地方）的舆论来决定的事情，而不是由别的人来决定的事情。地方政府在中央政府的领导下行使职能，没有一个外国政府能够自封代表西藏自治讲话的权利。
    他说，西藏的这种地位是为印度政府所承认的；从1954年中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定并不是由印度政府同西藏地方政府签订，而是由印度政府同人民中国政府签订这一事实，就可以清楚地看出这一点。印度不仅承认了中国对西藏的主权，而且，1954年的协定只是同中央人民政府签订这个事实还说明，1951年的和平解放西藏的协议也得到了承认。而那个协议肯定印度无权以西藏的保护人的身份去进行干涉。
    兰那地夫说，“印度的一些人以自治的名义所主张的就是西藏从中国分裂出去。有些人企图变个戏法，把独立和自治等同起来，然后，假如中国人进行反击的话，他们就抱怨。”
    兰那地夫又说，人民社会党的“阿索卡·梅达和普拉卡希等人一直在宣传西藏的个性受到破坏。这种西藏生活方式完全是怎样呢？这种西藏个性究竟是什么呢？”他接着分析了西藏的社会结构，并叙述了农奴的悲惨生活。他说，“当人民社会党反共领导人、印度人民同盟反动分子和这个国家的无数牌号的‘社会主义者’攻击中国的时候，他们是在保卫农奴主的西藏。印度的哪一个农民、哪一个工人同情他们呢？保卫农奴制度就是保卫在喇嘛统治下强加在群众头上的愚昧。迷信，无知，精神萎缩和个性得不到发展是喇嘛统治的结果，而这种统治就是我们的‘社会主义者’想要保持的。”
    兰那地夫说，“认为我们的国家安全遭到前进的社会主义的威胁、遭到我们的边境那边的民主和社会主义国家的兴起的威胁的那种想法，是向帝国主义者借来的一种阶级概念。我国的工人、农民和其他普通人对我们边境那边正在发展着的社会主义没有什么可以害怕的。他们一定会欢迎它，认为它是他们所致力的事业的进一步胜利。”
    兰那地夫指出，“印度的国家安全不是、也不可能是建立在西藏的落后、强迫西藏停留在中世纪阶段、企图把它同中国割裂开来、要求西藏改革的步伐放慢等基础之上。无可非议，印度的安全将由于以潘查希拉和反抗各地的帝国主义这个共同愿望为基础的社会主义的中国和独立的印度之间的友好了解而得到加强。因为中印友谊是我们安全的最大保证之一。它对印度和对中国人民都是不可缺少的。它是亚洲自由与和平的基础”。
    兰那地夫认为尼赫鲁是潘查希拉原则的共同发起人，他在印度同中国的关系上接受了这些原则，为了印中两国的共同安全和自由，重申潘查希拉原则以及恢复中国和印度之间的热烈的友好关系是非常必要的。
