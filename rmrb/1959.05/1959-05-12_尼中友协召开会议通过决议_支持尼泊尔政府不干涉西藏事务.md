    Sino-Nepalese Friendship Association Holds Meeting and Passes Resolution
    Supporting the Nepalese Government's Non-Interference in Tibetan Affairs
    (Our dispatch from Delhi) The Nepal-China Friendship Association held a meeting in Kathmandu on April 28th and unanimously passed a resolution expressing support for the Nepalese government's position of non-interference in Tibetan affairs. The resolution stated that Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs. The resolution expressed hope that the situation would stabilize soon.
    Many prominent figures from Nepal participated in this meeting. In their speeches, many advocated for non-interference in the Tibetan issue, which is China's internal affair. The Chairman of the Kathmandu Municipal Committee said in his speech: Nepal adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and should therefore not adopt any attitude that implies interference in Tibet. Dashan, the former Chief Secretary to the King, said that the Tibetan issue is China's internal affair and expressed hope that the disturbances would end soon and autonomy would be realized. Yami, the former leader of the National Congress Party, said that those who spread rumors that Nepal is in danger are trying to drag Nepal into the Cold War, thereby introducing foreign troops. Bahadur, the Chairman of the Sino-Nepalese Friendship Association, said that the rebellion was launched by imperialism in order to provoke disputes between China and India. Sharma, the General Secretary of the People's Party, said that China should not be opposed on the Tibetan issue, and Nepal should take steps to eliminate tensions between India and China, rather than following any one country.
    As early as March 26th, the Nepalese government stated that the Tibetan incident was entirely China's internal affair, and as a neighboring country, the Nepalese government hoped that China would quickly control the situation and restore peace and order. In April, Nepalese government officials issued statements three times, refuting rumors that Chinese troops had invaded the Nepalese border.

    尼中友协召开会议通过决议
    支持尼泊尔政府不干涉西藏事务
    本报讯　德里消息：尼（泊尔）中（国）友好协会4月28日在加德满都举行会议，一致通过决议，表示支持尼泊尔政府采取不干涉西藏事务的立场。决议说，西藏事务是中国的内政。决议表示希望局势能够早日安定。
    尼泊尔的许多知名人士参加了这一次会议，他们许多人在发言中，都主张不干涉属于中国内政的西藏问题。加德满都市政委员会主席在发言中说：尼泊尔遵守五项原则，因之不应采取任何意味着干涉西藏的态度。前任国王首席秘书达山说，西藏问题是中国内政，希望骚乱早日终止，实现自治。前任民族大会党领袖雅密说，那些散布尼泊尔遭到危险谰言的人，目的是想把尼泊尔拉进冷战，从而引进外国军队。尼中友协主席巴哈杜尔说，叛乱是帝国主义发动的，为的是挑起中、印两国的争端。人民党总书记夏尔玛说，不能在西藏问题上反对中国，尼泊尔应该采取步骤消除印、中两国间的紧张局势，而不应追随任何一国。
    早在3月26日，尼泊尔政府就表示过：西藏事件完全是中国的内部问题，作为一个邻国的尼泊尔的政府希望中国迅速控制局势和恢复和平秩序。4月间，尼泊尔政府负责官员曾先后三次发表谈话，驳斥所谓中国军队侵犯尼泊尔边界的谣言。
