Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th - The first 72,500 kW hydroelectric generating equipment manufactured by Harbin Electric Machinery Works for the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station was completed on the 14th. This large-scale power generation equipment weighs more than 1,000 tons, and the electricity it generates is enough to light a big city with a population of six million. The successful trial production of this major equipment marks a major step forward in China's power machinery industry in the manufacture of large-scale hydroelectric generating equipment.

This hydroelectric generating equipment is divided into two parts: a water turbine and a hydroelectric generator. The hydroelectric generator was completed as early as the end of last year. The now completed water turbine includes a volute for guiding water and a rotor for transmission. The volute, welded from thick steel plates, is taller than a one-story building and can accommodate several small cars; the rotor main shaft of the water turbine requires two people to join hands to embrace it. Although these parts are huge, their quality precision requirements are very high.

In the process of manufacturing this equipment, the Harbin Electric Machinery Works, in order to achieve both high quality and speed, initially formulated detailed operation plans and quality assurance manuals based on product progress and quality requirements. Because the factory leaders earnestly educated the workers on ensuring quality, the workers were very concerned about quality in production. Rationalization proposals for ensuring quality were put forward one after another. The quality of the twenty-four stay ring shaft hole machining of the water turbine is the key to determining the quality of the entire water turbine. Thanks to the many quality assurance measures taken by the workers, the quality of this key process was finally guaranteed. After assembly tests and quality appraisal, it fully meets the quality standards.

The manufacture of this large-scale hydroelectric generating equipment has received enthusiastic assistance from Soviet experts. The Soviet expert team leader stationed in the factory, Yevdokimov, designer Petrov and others, work with the workers in the workshop every day. With their rich experience, they promptly discover and help solve various problems in production, which not only improves the technical level of the workers, but also plays a significant role in ensuring the quality of the water turbine.

    标志我国电机制造工业向前迈进一大步
    72，500瓩水力发电设备诞生
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　哈尔滨电机厂为新安江水电站制造的我国第一套七万二千五百瓩的水力发电设备，已在14日全部完成。这套大型发电设备重达一千多吨，它发出的电力足够拥有六百万人口的大城市照明之用。这套重大设备的试制成功，标志着我国动力机械工业在制造大型水力发电设备方面向前迈进了一大步。
    这套水力发电设备分为水轮机和水轮发电机两个部分。水轮发电机早在去年年底就已制成。现在完工的水轮机包括导水用的涡壳和传动用转子等。由厚钢板焊接成的涡壳比一层楼还高，可以开进几部小汽车；水轮机的转子大轴，要两个人手拉手才能合抱起来。这些部件虽然庞大，但是质量精度要求却很高。
    哈尔滨电机厂在制造这套设备的过程中，为了作到又好又快，一开始就根据产品进度和质量要求，编制了详尽的作业计划和保证质量的手册。由于工厂领导对职工认真地进行了保证质量的教育，职工们在生产中都十分关心质量。保证质量的合理化建议一条接着一条提了出来。水轮机的二十四个座环轴孔加工的好坏，是决定整个水轮机质量的关键。由于职工们采取了许多保证质量的措施，终于使这个关键工序的质量得到保证。经过装配试验和质量鉴定，完全符合质量标准。
    这套大型水力发电设备的制造，得到了苏联专家的热诚帮助。驻厂的苏联专家组长叶夫道基莫夫、设计师彼得罗夫等，每天都在车间和工人一起工作。他们以丰富的经验，及时发现与帮助解决生产中的各种问题，这不仅提高了工人的技术水平，而且对保证水轮机的质量起了重大作用。（附图片）
