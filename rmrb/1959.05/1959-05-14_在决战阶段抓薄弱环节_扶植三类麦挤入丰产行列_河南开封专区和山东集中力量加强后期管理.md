From our newspaper in Zhengzhou, 13th: “Preserve every plant, transform every mu, and strive to make every mu of third-category wheat have large ears and full grains.” This is the battle cry of Kaifeng Prefecture, Henan Province, in the final battle to seize a bumper wheat harvest.

Kaifeng Prefecture has planted more than 15 million mu of wheat this year, and most of it is growing well. Especially this year, management has been timely and measures have been meticulous. At every key stage of wheat growth, management of third-category wheat has been strengthened. Therefore, according to statistics in mid-April, most of the third-category wheat fields in the region have been upgraded. Only 2.63 million mu of wheat fields are still short, with weak stalks, small ears, and few grains due to poor soil conditions and insufficient management. In order to fight the final battle for a bumper wheat harvest, the Kaifeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to seize the current opportunity of wheat heading, flowering, and grain filling from late April, break the idea of ​​a fixed situation, and launch another major campaign to manage third-category wheat. The aim is to universally irrigate once, universally apply a quick-acting fertilizer, and attack grain and kernels, so that every third-category wheat plant has large ears and full grains, in order to achieve high yields per mu. Since the district launched a blitz to eliminate third-category wheat seedlings from late April, more than 24,600 secretaries of party committees at all levels have been involved in this blitz, and nearly 1.12 million people have formed a mighty professional team to eliminate third-category wheat seedlings. As of May 2nd, the area of ​​topdressing had reached 2.01 million mu. In addition to most areas receiving rain and thorough moisture, more than 800,000 mu had been topdressed with water. Through careful cultivation and management, the 2.63 million mu of third-category wheat in the region has undergone significant changes. Two million mu have been upgraded to second-category, and the spikelet rate has generally increased by more than 30%. The third-category wheat fields that have not been upgraded have gradually changed from yellow to green, from short to tall, and the ears of wheat have also changed from thin to strong.

Party committees in various places attach great importance to grasping the third category of wheat and fighting the final battle for a bumper harvest. All counties in the district have established special production headquarters for the elimination of third-category wheat seedlings. In addition to establishing a special leading body in the county, Shangqiu County established command posts in all seventeen communes, and the county also drew more than 20% of its labor force to invest in the blitz to eliminate third-category wheat seedlings. Ma Changzhi, the first secretary of the Pingtai Commune Party Committee, personally managed two mu of third-category wheat fields. After management, there were four changes: from yellow to green, from short to tall, from small ears to large ears, and from few kernels to many kernels. In seven days, it grew five inches. The unmanaged ears generally had only five to nine "ma", while the managed ears had eight to eleven "ma." After field station calculations, the 790 mu of third-category wheat in the Fourth Battalion Brigade of this commune can yield an additional 30 jin per mu, and the entire brigade can increase production by 27,000 jin. The masses were very enthusiastic and reflected: whether you eat super-produced grain or not, there is a lot to be gained from the third category of wheat.

In strengthening the management of third-category wheat, various places have conscientiously criticized fixed-mindset thinking and broken through ideological barriers. When the Prefectural Committee proposed taking the elimination of third-category wheat as the main measure for late-stage wheat field management, some people initially believed that late-stage wheat field management was ineffective, like pasting door gods on the fifteenth day of the first month, half a month late; others believed that even if third-category wheat was reprocessed, it would not be able to launch a big satellite and would not be able to reach Beijing. In response to these ideas, various places launched debates through investigation, calculation, recalling comparisons, and holding on-site meetings. The Zhao Zhuang Brigade of the Linlu Commune in Huaiyang County held a forum for team cadres and veteran farmers to prove that topdressing wheat fields with fertilizer and water after Grain Rain can still increase production, based on the experience of managing third-category wheat seedlings last year. Last year, the Zhao Zhuang Advanced Cooperative applied an additional 2,000 jin of fine fertilizer to fifteen mu after Grain Rain, and each mu yielded an average of 106 jin, while another ten mu were not fertilized and yielded an average of only 87 jin per mu. After comparison, the entire brigade universally applied a topdressing of chemical fertilizer to the third-category wheat fields within two or three days, averaging more than 50 jin per mu. Eleven communes in Sui County found typical examples of good management as units of communes, and universally held on-site meetings to organize visits and comparisons, and exchange management experience, quickly setting off a climax of eliminating third-category wheat fields throughout the county. Gu Benxin, the party branch secretary of the Matou Production Brigade in Luyi County, led more than 20 members and personally managed 40 mu of third-category wheat fields. Within three days, they universally applied a topdressing of human manure and urine and watered them once. The third-category wheat quickly changed its appearance, the ear heads grew larger, and each ear grew one or two more grains of wheat. The brigade immediately held an on-site meeting here to exchange experiences. After the visit, the entire team applied more than 2,400 carts of fertilizer and 350,000 jin of homemade chemical fertilizer to 1,460 mu of third-category wheat within five days, and also applied more than 400 bottles of plant growth hormone.

In order to ensure the need for third-category wheat fertilizer, various communes have vigorously engaged in fine fertilizer and expanded fertilizer plants. According to incomplete statistics from the region, 3,888 various soil chemical fertilizer plants have been newly built, expanded, and restored. The Hongmiao Commune in Lankao County originally had ten soil chemical fertilizer plants. Since late April, it has adopted the method of producing and supporting at the same time, and quickly expanded to 114. The tens of thousands of jin of chemical fertilizer topdressed on the third-category wheat in the entire commune were all manufactured by the brigades themselves.

From our newspaper in Jinan, 13th: People's communes in various parts of Shandong Province are concentrating a large number of labor forces and pig manure fertilizers to attack the key stages of wheat heading, flowering, and grain filling, promoting larger ears, more grains, and fuller grains.

Four counties including Boxing, Huimin, and Wudi have concentrated more than 250,000 laborers from sideline occupations and water conservancy fronts to strengthen late-stage wheat field management, and have applied topdressing to 210,000 mu and watered 170,000 mu in just five days, promoting the victorious heading and grain filling of wheat. The people's communes in Yexian, Anqiu, and Shanxian also allocated 1.12 million jin of chemical fertilizer used for spring fields to topdress more than 200,000 mu of wheat fields. The people's communes in Licheng, Zouping, and other counties, after summarizing the experience of strengthening late-stage wheat management last year and criticizing the erroneous thinking of some commune and team cadres that the wheat harvest had become a "foregone conclusion," rapidly increased the labor force participating in wheat field management from the original 100,000 to 170,000. Rizhao County, which has basically completed spring sowing, organized 1,243 professional teams to attack the key stages of wheat heading and grain filling, and has now watered more than 48,000 mu and prevented insect pests on 215,000 mu.

In order to ensure overall high yield, all localities attach particular importance to the management of third-category wheat fields. Changwei and Jining regions and Jinan City have adopted the method of fixing professional teams and dividing areas to contract, and have set a time limit to promote the upgrading of third-category wheat seedlings. Linqing City organized 7,000 cadres above the level of production team leader and 13,000 activists to be responsible for the management of third-category wheat seedlings. After universal topdressing and watering, 50,000 mu of the county's 60,000 mu of third-category wheat seedlings have begun to turn from yellow to green. The people's communes in Jining Prefecture and Linqu County are concentrating existing chemical fertilizers, vigorously developing soil chemical fertilizers, adding more urine tanks and toilets, and cleaning up human manure and urine to meet the needs of topdressing third-category wheat seedlings. Yantai and Liaocheng prefectures, through on-site inspections, checking the number of plants, calculating output, and looking at wheat seedlings, criticized the idea of ​​some cadres that "third-category wheat seedlings have no prospects," and quickly set off a climax of blitzing the management of third-category wheat seedlings. Now, more than half of the 2.08 million mu of third-category wheat seedlings in these two prefectures have been topdressed and watered.

In strengthening wheat field management, all localities attach importance to preventing insect pests. Rust disease occurred in wheat fields in parts of Liaocheng, Jining, Yantai, and Changwei regions and Jinan City, and has been completely eliminated after spraying and dusting; in addition, red spiders, wheat sawflies, wireworms, and other insect pests have also been controlled. The people's communes in Rizhao, Cangshan, and other counties also sprayed lime water and lime sulfur mixture in high-yield wheat fields to prevent the occurrence of insect pests.

    在决战阶段抓薄弱环节
    扶植三类麦挤入丰产行列
    河南开封专区和山东集中力量加强后期管理
    本报郑州13日电  “有一棵保一棵，改变一亩是一亩，力争三类麦亩亩穗大、粒饱”，这是河南省开封专区在夺取小麦大丰收的最后一仗中提出的战斗口号。
    开封专区今年种植一千五百多万亩小麦，大部分生长很好。特别是今年管理及时，措施细致，在小麦生长的各个关口都加强了对三类麦的管理，因此，到4月中旬统计，全区大部分三类麦田都已经升级。只有二百六十三万亩麦田，由于土质条件差，管理工作还不够，生长低矮，秆子瘦弱，穗小粒少。为了打好小麦丰收的最后一仗，中共开封地委决定从4月下旬起抓紧当前麦穗正在扬花、灌浆的时机，打破定局论，再大抓一次三类麦，采取普浇一遍水，普施一遍速效肥，攻籽、攻仁，使三类麦棵棵穗大、粒饱，以达到亩亩高产。全区从4月下旬开展突击消灭三类麦苗运动以来，投入这个突击运动的各级党委书记有二万四千六百多人，将近一百一十二万多人组成了浩浩荡荡的消灭三类麦苗专业队伍。到5月2日为止，追肥面积已达到二百零一万亩，除了大部分地区下雨透墒以外，追浇水八十多万亩。经过细致的培育管理，全区二百六十三万亩三类麦已经起了显著的变化。有二百万亩已经升为二类，孕穗率普遍增加30％以上，没有升级的三类麦田，也逐渐由黄变绿，由低长高，麦穗也都由瘦小变为壮大。
    各地党委对抓好三类麦，打好丰收最后一仗都非常重视，全区各县都专门成立了消灭三类麦苗生产指挥部。商丘县除了县里建立了专门的领导机构以外，全县十七个公社都成立了指挥所，全县并且抽出20％以上的劳力，投入消灭三类麦苗的突击运动。平台公社党委第一书记马长治亲自搞了两亩三类麦田，管理后有四变：由黄变绿，由低变高，由穗小变穗大，由仁少变仁多，七天时间就长了五寸。没有管理的穗子一般只有五个码到九个码，管理后的穗子有八个码到十一个码。这个社四营大队七百九十亩三类麦，在管理后，通过田间站队，每亩可以多收三十斤，全大队就可以多增产二万七千斤。群众情绪非常高涨，纷纷反映：吃超产粮不吃超产粮，三类麦里大有文章。
    在加强管理三类麦中，各地都认真批判了定局思想，突破思想关。地委提出把消灭三类麦作为麦田后期管理的主要措施时，开始有些人认为麦田后期管理无效，是正月十五贴门神，晚了半个月了；有的认为，三类麦再加工，也放不了大卫星，上不了北京城。针对这些思想，各地都通过查、算、回忆对比和召开现场会议的办法，展开了辩论。淮阳县林鹾公社赵庄大队召开队干部、老农座谈会，以去年管理三类麦苗的经验，证明谷雨后麦地追肥加水一样能够增产。去年赵庄高级社有十五亩在谷雨后多施了二千斤细肥，每亩平均就收一百零六斤，另有十亩未施肥，平均每亩只收了八十七斤。经过对比以后，全大队两、三天内，就在三类麦田内普追了一遍化肥，每亩平均达到五十斤以上。睢县十一个公社都以社为单位找出管理好的典型，普遍召开现场会议组织参观评比，交流管理经验，很快掀起了全县消灭三类麦田的高潮。鹿邑县马头生产大队党支部书记古本信，领着二十多个社员，亲自搞了四十亩三类麦田，三天内普追人粪尿一遍，浇了一次水，三类麦很快就变了样，穗头长大了，每个穗子上麦仁多长了一粒到两粒。大队马上在这里召开了现场会议，交流了经验。参观以后，全队一千四百六十亩三类麦，五天内就追施二千四百多车肥，土制化肥三十五万斤，还打了植物生长素四百多瓶。
    为了保证三类麦肥料的需要，各个公社都大搞细肥和扩建肥料厂。据全区不完全统计，新建、扩建和恢复的各种土化肥厂有三千八百八十八处。兰考县红庙公社原有十个土化肥厂，在4月下旬以来，采取边生产、边支援的办法，很快扩建到一百一十四个。全公社三类麦追施的几十万斤化肥，全部是各个大队自己制造的。
    本报济南13日电  山东省各地人民公社集中大批劳力和猪厩肥料，猛攻小麦抽穗扬花、灌浆关，促使小麦穗大、粒多、粒饱。
    博兴、惠民、无棣等四个县，从副业、水利战线上集中了二十五万多劳力加强麦田后期管理，仅在五天内就追肥二十一万亩，浇水十七万亩，促使了小麦胜利抽穗、灌浆。掖县、安丘和单县的人民公社还将用于春田的化学肥料拨出一百一十二万斤，追施了二十多万亩麦田。历城、邹平等县的人民公社通过总结去年加强小麦后期管理的经验，批判了部分社、队干部认为小麦收成已成“定局”的错误思想后，参加麦田管理的劳力由原来十万人迅速增加到十七万人。春播基本结束的日照县，组织了一千二百四十三个专业队，猛攻小麦抽穗、灌浆关，现已浇水四万八千多亩，防止虫害二十一万五千亩。
    为了保证全面丰产，各地特别重视突击三类麦田的管理。昌潍、济宁两区和济南市采取固定专业队伍、划片包干的办法，限期促使三类麦苗升级。临清市组织了七千名生产队长以上的干部和一万三千名积极分子负责管理三类麦苗。这个县的六万亩三类麦苗经过普遍追肥和浇水，已有五万亩开始由黄转青。济宁专区和临朐等县的人民公社正在集中现有化肥，同时大搞土化肥，增设尿缸、厕所，清扫人粪尿，满足三类麦苗追肥的需要。烟台和聊城专区通过实地检查，查棵数、算产量、看麦苗，批判了部分干部认为“三类麦苗没出息”的思想后，迅速掀起了突击管理三类麦苗的高潮。现在这两个专区的二百零八万亩三类麦苗已有半数以上进行了追肥浇水。
    在加强麦田管理中，各地都重视预防虫害。聊城、济宁、烟台、昌潍专区和济南市的部分地区麦田发生锈病，经过喷药、撒粉，已经全部消灭；另外对红蜘蛛、麦叶蜂、金针虫等虫害，也进行了防治。日照、苍山等县的人民公社还在丰产麦田里喷石灰水和石灰硫磺合剂，预防虫害的发生。
