Liu Jiaxia Builders Fight the Yellow River with Wisdom and Courage
Qing Tongxia Power Station Construction Site Actively Prepares for Flood Control
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th - The 15,000 workers building the Liu Jiaxia Hydropower Station are battling the Yellow River with great intensity, accelerating construction, and determined to cut off the Yellow River ahead of schedule within the year.

Since construction began in September last year on this giant hydropower station located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, a 675-meter long, 14-meter diameter diversion tunnel has been completed. Currently, workers are working hard on expanding the tunnel walls and concrete lining. On the right bank of the future dam, workers are excavating the foundations for two auxiliary dams on mountain peaks over 100 meters high. On several mountains slightly downstream, more than 5,000 workers are mining stone for the dam construction. The roadbed project for the railway from Lanzhou to Liu Jiaxia, built for the Liu Jiaxia Hydropower Station, has extended to the dam site terminus; the left bank highway through which large trucks will pass during the cutoff is also continuing to widen. The entire construction site is a hive of activity to complete the cutoff project ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 19th - Workers at the Qing Tongxia Hydropower Station construction site on the Yellow River are making various preparations to safely pass this year's flood season.

According to meteorological forecasts, the flood season in the Qing Tongxia area may arrive early this year, and the floods will be larger than last year. Safely passing this year's flood season is an important link to ensure the timely completion of the Qing Tongxia Hydropower Station and the entire water conservancy hub project. To this end, the Yellow River Qing Tongxia Engineering Bureau has established a special flood control headquarters, and corresponding flood control organizations have also been established in various work areas. In early May, workers in various work areas comprehensively inspected the quality of the project, formulated various systems related to flood control, and established flood control and rescue teams and prepared flood control materials. They strive to ensure that not only will the completed projects not be damaged during the flood season, but also that the ongoing projects will continue to be constructed as usual.

Xin'anjiang Power Station Enters Impoundment Stage
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 19th - Workers building the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station are racing against the floods, striving to complete the impoundment task ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of this year, it has already endured two extraordinary floods unseen in a century. The workers fought the floods and continued various construction tasks. As of early May, more than 320,000 cubic meters of concrete pouring and more than 255 tons of steel pipe installation tasks have been completed. Now the hydropower station construction has entered the impoundment stage. At the end of April, after the workers lowered the huge gate in the tenth section of the dam, the rolling river water was driven from the left side to the right side and flowed downstream through the bottom hole on the right. After the concrete pouring of the bottom plate of the downstream overflow powerhouse was completed, the pouring of the powerhouse side walls began immediately.

In order to complete the impoundment task before the arrival of the third flood, the workers of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station are competing to improve construction technology, ensure project quality, and accelerate the speed of project construction. New records exceeding quotas are constantly emerging on the construction site. More than 20 instrument installation workers and technicians immediately buried various instruments after a layer of concrete was poured on the dam to measure and observe the quality of the dam. This system of inspection following construction played a very good role in ensuring the quality of the dam.

Yunnan Plateau Yang Zonghai Power Plant Initially Takes Shape
According to Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 19th - On the misty shores of Yang Zonghai Lake on the Yunnan Plateau, a modern power plant has initially taken shape. A chimney over 50 meters high, the main plant building, and the tall steel supports of the No. 1 unit's boiler have all been erected. More than 5,000 workers on the construction site are working day and night.

The Yang Zonghai Power Plant is currently the largest thermal power plant in Yunnan Province. The first phase of the project has five units, and the power generation is equal to 1.6 times the existing power in Kunming. It is built on the edge of Yang Zonghai Lake and is only a few kilometers away from the coal mine, with very good conditions.

The construction of this power plant has received strong support from both inside and outside the province. Harbin, Shanghai and other places have supplied all the main engines. More than 30 factories in six provinces and more than a dozen factories in Kunming have manufactured supporting equipment for the power plant. The Yunnan Provincial Water Resources and Electric Power Department has transferred nearly two-thirds of its basic construction force to participate in the construction of the power plant. The head of the Provincial Materials Bureau led 60 to 70 people to assist various enterprises in Kunming in clearing warehouses and finding materials urgently needed by the power plant. Thanks to the support of all parties and the efforts of the construction workers, the construction speed of the power plant is accelerating.

Jilin Thermal Power Plant Produces While Building
According to Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 19th - The Jilin Thermal Power Plant is producing while building. In the more than 200-meter-long factory building, one end is the production workshop, where huge steam turbine generator units are operating rumblingly, constantly generating a large amount of electricity; the other end is the construction site, where workers are working hard to install a large 50,000-kilowatt generator unit.

This unit was originally planned to be installed in 60 days, but after discussion, the workers repeatedly shortened the construction period and finally decided to complete it in 35 days. At present, the steam engine part has been basically installed, and the generator part has also begun to be installed. During the installation process, the workers disassembled and cleaned the equipment weighing more than 1,000 tons piece by piece, and then assembled them piece by piece to ensure the installation quality. A high-temperature and high-pressure boiler that is matched with this generator unit has now been installed ahead of schedule and is undergoing trial operation; another identical boiler is also being installed intensely.

Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station Under Full Construction
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th - The construction project of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station has entered the full construction stage. At present, all components of the main project of the hydropower station are progressing simultaneously. The 19 dam piers of the dam have emerged from the river surface, and more than 120,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured, accounting for about a quarter of the total amount of concrete to be poured for the dam. The pouring of the powerhouse has also been completed by about one-tenth.

In order to strive for power generation ahead of schedule, more than 20,000 builders are working day and night on the construction site. In the face of the spring flood that was unprecedented in 20 years, they fought fiercely. Although the flood had breached a gap in the cofferdam twice, the workers repeatedly repaired it and finally closed the cofferdam. The builders also rushed to build dam piers and transport sand and gravel during the continuous rainy season to prevent the dam from being submerged by the early arrival of the flood. At present, the builders on the construction site are enthusiastically launching a high-efficiency movement, determined to build all the dam piers of the dam to an elevation of more than 75 meters in the second quarter.

Shenyang Tiexi Thermal Power Plant Vigorously Installs Equipment
According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th - The Shenyang Tiexi Thermal Power Plant, which is under construction, is accelerating the construction speed while ensuring the quality of the project. It has now entered the unit installation stage.

This thermal power plant is the largest new power plant in Shenyang. The motor capacity of the first phase of the project this year can reach 50,000 kilowatts. The workers participating in the construction of this project, since the start of construction in October last year, have completed a main factory building of nearly 8,000 square meters, a huge cooling water tower as high as 65 meters, a chimney 120 meters high, and the main civil engineering of coal transportation, pipeline and other systems in a relatively short period of time with excellent quality, creating favorable conditions for the project to quickly enter the installation stage.

In order to ensure the installation quality and shorten the construction period, in addition to establishing a boiler installation headquarters, the thermal power plant has also strengthened the inspection of project quality. Quality inspectors closely cooperate with construction workers to find quality problems and solve them in time, which not only accelerates the construction progress but also ensures the quality.
