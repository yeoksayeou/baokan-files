A batch of teachers and students from Guangxi Medical College who went to the Chengbi River Reservoir construction site in Baise, Guangxi, to participate in labor training enthusiastically brought medical and health knowledge to the masses. During their three months in the countryside, they trained more than 800 health workers for the construction site, and established ten construction site hospitals; they also used their spare time to widely disseminate relevant health knowledge to cooks and family members.

In the construction site hospitals and health stations, these newly trained health workers have already begun working. From checking patient rooms, taking temperatures, providing nursing care, writing handover records, decocting and administering medicine to patients, to washing patients' clothes, they are also able to assist doctors in diagnosing several common epidemics and carrying out simple treatments. The environmental sanitation of the construction site is very good. The labor teams from various counties have all divided cleaning areas and are responsible for them on a contract basis. Every few days, everyone works together to clean up. No garbage or weeds can be seen near the workers' sheds and around the dormitories. Those responsible for growing vegetables are in charge of the toilets under contract. The cooks clean the inside and outside of the kitchen every day, and the cleaned food jars and bowls are disinfected before being stored. The laborers also often have the opportunity to take a bath.

The teachers and students mainly adopted the method of teaching while doing to train construction site health workers. For example, first explain the general new acupuncture techniques, commonly used acupoints, and acupuncture methods for several common diseases. Then, take the students to check the patient rooms. Discuss how to perform acupuncture according to the patient's condition, and conduct practical training, so that the students learn quickly and remember firmly. In terms of medication, according to rural characteristics and habits, they not only teach students to use Western medicine, but also teach them to use a large number of traditional Chinese medicines. At the same time, some students with junior high school education or above were organized to attend centralized classes appropriately, and the basic medical theories were explained in simple terms for several common diseases, and clarified in combination with the things that the students were familiar with, so good results were achieved.

Before popularizing health knowledge to the masses, the teachers and students went deep into practice to "prepare lessons." For example, when giving lectures on food hygiene to cooks, they first worked in the kitchen for a few days to understand the situation, and then carried out enlightenment and guidance education. They also actively summarized and promoted some good practices and experiences of the masses in improving environmental sanitation and food hygiene.

    广西医学院师生参加水库工地劳动
    边做边讲传授卫生知识
    本报讯　到广西百色澄碧河水库工地劳动锻炼的广西医学院的一批师生，热情地把医疗卫生知识带给群众。他们在下乡的三个月里，为工地培训了八百多个保健员，建立了十所工地医院；还利用工余时间，向炊事员和家属等广泛传播有关卫生常识。
    在工地医院和卫生所里，这一批新培养出来的保健员已开始工作。从查病房、探体温、护理、写交班记录、给病人煎药服药到洗病人的衣服，并且能够协助医生诊断几种常见的流行病和进行简易治疗。工地的环境卫生做的很好，来自各县的民工团，都划分了清洁区，分片包干。每隔几天，大家一齐动手扫除一次。在工棚附近和宿舍周围，看不见垃圾和杂草。负责种菜的包干管理厕所。炊事员天天打扫伙房内外，洗干净的饭罐和碗盆经过消毒才保存起来。民工们还常常有机会洗澡。
    师生们培养工地保健员，主要是采取边做边讲的办法。例如先讲普通的新针灸术、常用穴位和几种常见疾病的针灸方法。接着，带学员去查病房。根据病人情况讨论怎样针灸，并且进行实习，这样学员学的快、记的牢。在用药方面，按照农村特点和习惯，不仅教学员用西药，还教他们使用大量的中草药。与此同时，组织了具有高小文化程度以上的一些学员，适当地进行集中上课，针对几种常见疾病，深入浅出地讲授医学基本理论，并结合学员所熟知的事物加以阐明，因而收到了良好效果。
    在向群众普及卫生常识之前，师生们都深入实际去“备课”。如在给炊事员讲饮食卫生时，先到伙房干几天活和了解情况，然后进行启发和诱导教育。他们也积极总结推广群众中对改善环境卫生、饮食卫生的一些好作法和好经验。
