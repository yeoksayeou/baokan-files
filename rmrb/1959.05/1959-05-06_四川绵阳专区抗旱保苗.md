    The people of Mianyang Special District, Sichuan Province, in order to strive for a greater bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1959, have mobilized 2 million people to participate in the movement to fight drought and protect seedlings, seize the time to plant and harvest, and ensure that seedlings are complete, strong, fully planted, and fully inserted.
    Since April, most areas of Mianyang Special District have experienced very little rainfall, with strong winds and sunshine causing high water evaporation, and many winter paddy fields have become dehydrated and muddy. A portion of the sown cotton, corn, peanuts, and other crops have suffered from drought and a lack of seedlings. Due to the drought, various insect pests have also occurred. As soon as the signs of drought appeared, the District Committee immediately strengthened its cadre force and launched a concentrated effort to fight drought. Subsequently, it issued an urgent directive to immediately launch a campaign to fight drought and protect seedlings, rush to plant, rush to sow, and rush to harvest.
    After the District Committee's instructions were issued, various localities immediately took action. Tongnan, Shehong, Jiange and other counties alone had 450,000 people participating in the drought fight. The Secretary of the Tongnan County Committee and members of the County Committee divided their forces and guarded the townships and communes with severe drought conditions. After fighting the drought, 18,000 mu of early rice in the county have been fully planted, and 129,000 mu of mid-season rice have also been planted. Huangxu Commune in Deyang County held a meeting of cadres above the production team leader level. Through discussion, they corrected their paralyzing thoughts and stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to fight drought and protect seedlings. After the meeting, the entire commune organized more than 9,400 people, established 170 drought fighting teams, and deployed 121 waterwheels to irrigate the fields, watering 47 mu of sweet potato seedlings, 50 mu of cotton seedlings, and 250 mu of spring crops in one day. After several days of intense fighting in Mianyang County, more than 90% of the dry land has been rescued.
    At present, the movement to fight drought and protect seedlings is being carried out universally and in depth in all regions of the entire special district.

    四川绵阳专区抗旱保苗
    本报讯　四川省绵阳专区人民为了争取1959年农业生产的更大丰收，已有二百万人投入了抗旱保苗、抢种抢收运动，确保苗齐苗壮，满栽满插。
    4月份以来，绵阳专区大部分地区雨量很少，风吹日晒，水量蒸发大，不少冬水田脱水现泥。已播种的棉花、玉米、花生和其他作物，已有一部分因干旱缺苗。由于天旱，各种虫害也随之发生。地委在旱象刚一露头时，即重点加强干部力量，突击抗旱。随后，又发出了立即掀起抗旱保苗、抢栽、抢种、抢收运动的紧急指示。
    地委指示发出以后，各地立即行动起来。仅潼南、射洪、剑阁等县参加抗旱的就有四十五万人。潼南县委书记、县委委员分兵把守在旱象严重的乡、社，经过抗旱，全县一万八千亩早稻已满栽满插，中稻也栽了十二万九千亩。德阳县黄许公社召开了生产组长以上干部会议，通过讨论，纠正了麻痹思想，激发了群众抗旱保苗的积极性。全社在会后组织了九千四百多人，成立了一百七十个抗旱队，出动了一百二十一架水车车水灌田，一天内浇灌薯苗四十七亩，棉花苗五十亩，小春田二百五十亩。绵阳县经过几天的紧张战斗，90％以上的旱田得到了抢救。
    目前抗旱保苗运动正在全专区各个地区普遍深入的开展中。
