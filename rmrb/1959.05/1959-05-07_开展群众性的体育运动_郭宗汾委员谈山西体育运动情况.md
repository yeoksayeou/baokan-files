Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, and the various reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

　　Just as our country is continuing the great achievements of 1958 and leaping forward, a small handful of traitors in Tibet are openly engaging in rebellion, undermining the unity of the motherland, and clamoring for "Tibetan independence." This shameful behavior will not escape the "trouble-making, failure, more trouble-making, more failure, until final demise" law. I fully support Premier Zhou's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and pay my highest respect to the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its swift suppression of the rebellion.

　　I am currently working in the Shanxi Provincial Sports Commission, and I would like to share my experiences in sports work with the conference. Please correct any inaccuracies. During the reactionary rule, the level of sports in Shanxi was very low. There was no consideration for the people's health. Sometimes, a few athletes were trained solely for show. The vast working people had no opportunity to participate in sports. Therefore, the foundation left to us by the old society was negligible. After liberation, Chairman Mao first put forward the instruction "Develop sports and improve the people's physical fitness." Then, the Party Central Committee made a formal resolution to enhance the people's physical fitness and promote people's health as a political task. Only then did sports have a clear goal and developed as a cause for the entire Party and the entire people. Only then were sports grasped by the proletariat and the broad working people. However, before the rectification and anti-rightist movement in 1957, the development of sports was not very smooth. At that time, sports workers in Shanxi, like those in other provinces across the country, had serious right-leaning conservative ideas and absurd rightist remarks. Especially in 1956, when sports work was done a little faster, there was a trend against "rash advance." The Labor Defense System was a good system, but it was not seriously implemented at that time. We did not dare to let go and develop sports for farmers, with many concerns and a lack of confidence. The workplace exercises in government agencies, factories, and mines were also carried out inconsistently, becoming laissez-faire. Some even used the excuse of being busy with work and heavy production tasks to completely squeeze out sports time. People in charge of sports work did not understand the Party's policies and principles on sports sufficiently and did not resolutely implement sports as a political task, which affected the development of sports to a certain extent.

　　New Situation in Sports

　　In 1958, on the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist movement, rightist remarks were crushed, right-leaning ideas were overcome, and sports work first achieved political command, resolutely relied on the leadership of the Party, and adhered to the Party's mass line. Only then did sports reappear in an unprecedentedly favorable new situation. After the National Sports Work Conference in February, the province and Taiyuan City jointly convened a sports Great Leap Forward conference with over 10,000 participants in early March. The provincial and municipal Party committees personally attended and presided over the conference, which quickly affected all special districts and cities in the province. The Jinan Special District first saw four counties, including Jishan and Wanrong, popularize sports. Then, the Jin southeast Special District achieved the result of popularizing sports in all fifteen cities and counties in the district. However, the standards of popularization at this time were not very high. The organization of production cooperatives at that time could not well reflect the content of sports popularization. It was not until after the popularization of people's communes that sports organizations had a certain form. Combined with the requirements of the entire people being soldiers, sports became one of the main contents and was widely carried out in rural areas. By the end of 1958, more than 8 million of Shanxi's 15 million people had participated in organized sports activities. In fact, sports had basically been popularized among young and middle-aged people. In the past, school sports were considered to have methods, but due to the influence of conservative ideas, they felt it was difficult to implement the government's requirement that high school graduates should generally pass the Labor Defense System, and they dared not implement it. It was not until after the Great Leap Forward that students in schools could basically pass the Labor Defense System according to age standards. Factories, mines, and government agencies also launched fiery sports activities. The people's physical fitness has been significantly enhanced, and it is reflected in production that the vast majority of advanced production workers are also active participants in sports. Sports not only does not affect production but also becomes a powerful factor in promoting production. For example, the Seagull Women's Training Team and the Kochakin Training Team in Jishan County earn 30% to 40% more labor days per year than the average labor force, and the sports training team is always assigned to complete more difficult tasks. Another example is the Xinwei Textile Factory and the Taihang Instrument Factory in Shanxi, which won the Red Flag Award at the National Workers' Sports Competition. They have excellent results in sports and also outstanding results in production and the Great Smelting of Steel. Now, there is such an atmosphere in Shanxi: where production goes, sports work must follow. The more tense the central task is, the more active the activities of sports serving production are. Sports has gradually become an indispensable part of the lives of the working people. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "Sports aimed at enhancing the people's physical fitness achieved great results in 1958 and must continue to be developed in the future." Our achievements are still far from meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and we should continue to develop sports in accordance with the instructions in the report to consolidate the achievements already made in 1958.

　　Sports Level Improved

　　As for improving the level of sports, Shanxi had previously tried to train excellent athletes in the form of sports teams or competitive training teams, but the results were not as ideal as expected because without the foundation of mass sports activities, it is difficult to improve skills. Before "July 1" last year, Shanxi did not have a single athlete at the master level. In order to offer a gift to "July 1," only one weightlifting athlete at the master level was trained. However, after the widespread development of mass sports, the situation was very different. In addition to weightlifting, there were master-level athletes in wrestling, track and field, gymnastics, table tennis, etc. By the end of 1958, there were 34 master-level athletes. At each sports meeting, whether it was held by the province or by the special districts and cities, thousands and hundreds of new athletes appeared. Just in terms of the number of graded athletes, it has exceeded more than 130 times that before 1957, and the quality has also been significantly improved. Therefore, I feel that Premier Zhou's point in the work report that "In sports work, we should implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement, widely carry out mass sports activities, and gradually improve the level of sports in our country" is completely correct. Only on the basis of popularization can we improve, and under the guidance of improvement can we popularize more widely. Combining popularization and improvement can enable our country's sports to reach the highest level.

　　The scale of the National Great Leap Forward in 1959 is still very grand, and the production targets of Shanxi Province are also very high. Before the realization of mechanization and electrification of production, physical labor still occupies a major position in production. The vast working people need strong physical strength to engage in labor. The policy of sports serving production and serving national defense should be better implemented in the production front and among the people in the future. My political level is very low, and my professional level is not enough. I can only further and more meticulously improve my awareness of self-transformation, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, study Chairman Mao's works, study the general line of socialist construction, combine with my work, earnestly implement the Party's policies and principles, participate in various social practices and labor exercises, strictly demand myself, strengthen self-education, and contribute the greatest strength to the Great Leap Forward in 1959. Finally, I wish the conference success and good health to all committee members.

### 开展群众性的体育运动  郭宗汾委员谈山西体育运动情况

　　开展群众性的体育运动
    郭宗汾委员谈山西体育运动情况主席、各位委员：
    我对周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李维汉副主席所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，以及李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的各种报告，完全同意，并表示衷心地拥护。
    正当我国继续一九五八年伟大的成就而向前跃进的时候，西藏一小撮叛国分子，公开进行叛乱，破坏祖国统一，叫嚷什么“西藏独立”，这种可耻的行径，一定逃不出“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，最后直到死亡的规律”。我对周总理解散原西藏地方政府命令完全拥护，并对迅速平息叛乱的中国人民解放军致以崇高的敬意。
    我现在担任山西省体育运动委员会的工作，我愿就在体育工作上的体会，向大会谈一谈，不妥当的地方，请大会予以指正。山西的体育运动在反动统治时期，水平是非常低下的，根本谈不到为人民健康着想，有时培养几个运动员也是完全为了点缀门面，广大的劳动人民是没有机会去参加体育运动的。所以旧社会给我们留下来的底子是微不足道的。解放以后，毛主席首先提出“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示，接着党中央又把增强人民体质，增进人民健康的事，作为一项政治任务，作出正式的决议。这样体育运动事业才有了明确的目标，作为全党全民的事业去发展，体育运动才为无产阶级和广大劳动人民所掌握。然而在一九五七年整风反右运动以前，体育事业的发展也不是很顺利的。那时山西的体育工作者中间也和全国其他省份一样，有严重的右倾保守思想，也有荒谬的右派言论，尤其是一九五六年的体育工作作的稍为快了一些，当时就有一股反“冒进”的歪风。劳动卫国制度本是一种良好制度，但在当时却没有认真去推行。对农民的体育运动更不敢放手去开展，顾虑重重，信心不足。对机关、厂矿的工间操，也若有若无，形成自流状态。有的甚至借口工作忙，生产任务重，把体育运动的时间完全挤掉，负责体育工作的人们对党在体育工作上的政策、方针也体会的不够，没有把体育运动作为一项政治任务去坚决执行，使体育运动的开展，受到一定程度的影响。
    体育运动出现了新局面
    一九五八年在整风、反右胜利的基础上，右派言论被粉碎了，右倾思想被克服了，体育工作首先做到了政治挂帅，坚决依靠党的领导，坚持党的群众路线，体育运动才重新出现了空前有利的新局面。二月间全国体育工作会议以后，三月初即由省和太原市联合召开了有万余人参加的体育跃进大会，省、市党委亲自出席主持，很快地影响了全省各专、市，晋南专区首先出现了稷山、万荣等四个县普及了体育运动，接着晋东南专区出现了全区十五个市、县，普及了体育运动的成绩，不过这时的普及标准还不是很高的，那时的生产合作社的组织还不能很好的体现体育运动普及的内容，直到人民公社普及化以后，体育组织才有了一定的形式。结合全民皆兵的要求，体育运动成为主要内容之一，在农村中普遍的得到开展。截至一九五八年年底，山西全省一千五百多万人口中已有八百多万人参加了有组织的体育锻炼，实际上青壮年中基本上已普及了体育运动。学校体育运动过去算是有办法的，但由于保守思想作祟，对政府在高中毕业生要普遍通过劳动卫国制度的要求则认为有困难，不敢执行，直到大跃进以后，在校学生已基本上能按年龄标准通过劳卫制，厂矿、机关也都掀起了如火如荼的体育锻炼。人民的体质已显著的增强，表现在生产上的是绝大多数的生产先进分子也同样是体育运动积极分子。体育运动不但不会影响生产，而且成为促进生产的有力因素。如稷山县的海鸥女子锻炼队、柯察金锻炼队，她们和他们每年所得的劳动日数要多于一般劳动力的百分之三、四十，并且一遇有较艰巨的任务总是交体育锻炼队去完成。又如在全国职工体育运动评比大会上获得红旗奖的山西的新纬纺织厂和太行仪表厂，他们在体育上有优异成绩，在生产和大闹钢铁上也有出色的成绩。现在山西有这样一种风气，生产到那里，体育工作就要跟到那里，越是中心任务紧张的地方，体育为生产服务的活动就越积极，体育已渐渐成为劳动人民生活中一个不可缺少的内容了。正如周总理报告中所指出的“以增强人民体质为目的的体育运动，一九五八年有了很大的成绩，今后必须继续开展。”我们这些成绩离工农业大跃进的需要，还是远远不能适应的，应该按照报告中的指示去继续开展体育运动，以巩固一九五八年已得到的成绩。
    体育水平提高了
    至于提高体育水平方面，山西以前也曾试以体工队或竞技训练队的组织形式来培养优秀运动员，但其结果并不能尽如理想，因为没有广大群众的体育运动作基础，技术的提高是很困难的。去年“七一”以前，山西没有一个健将级运动员，为了向“七一”献礼，也仅仅培养了一个举重的健将级运动员，但在群众体育广泛地开展起来以后，情况就大不相同了，举重以外如摔跤、田径、体操、乒乓球等都有了健将级运动员，一九五八年年底，健将级运动员已有三十四名，每次运动会上，不论由省举办，或者是由专、市举办，都有成千、成百的新运动员出现。单按等级运动员的数目来讲，已超过一九五七年以前的一百三十多倍，质量也有显著的提高。因此我感到周总理在工作报告中所指出的“在体育工作中，应当贯彻执行普及和提高相结合的方针，广泛开展群众性的体育运动，逐步提高我国的体育水平”是完全正确的。只有在普及的基础上才能提高，在提高的指导下才能更广泛的普及，普及与提高相结合，才能使我国体育达到最高的水平。
    一九五九年全国大跃进的规模仍是十分宏伟的，山西省的生产指标也是很高的，在没有实现生产机械化、电气化以前，体力劳动在生产中还占主要地位，广大的劳动人民需要以强大的体力从事劳动，体育运动为生产服务，为国防服务的方针，今后应该更好地贯彻到生产战线和人民群众中去。我的政治水平很低，业务水平也不够，只有更加深入、更加细致地提高自我改造的自觉性，加强学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习毛泽东主席的著作，学习社会主义建设总路线，结合岗位工作，认真体现党的方针、政策，参加各种社会实践和劳动锻炼，严格地要求自己，加强自我教育，为一九五九年的大跃进贡献最大的力量。最后祝大会成功，各位委员健康。
