Xinhua News Agency, April 30th: People from all walks of life in the capital, more than 8,000 strong, held a grand meeting this afternoon to warmly welcome all the distinguished guests of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation headed by Prime Minister Münnich, and to warmly cheer the ever-strengthening militant friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people and the great unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union.

Today, the spacious hall of the Beijing Gymnasium was decorated solemnly and beautifully. The national flags of China and Hungary were hung high on the rostrum, and the front of the stage was filled with flowers. Huge red-lettered gold slogans hanging around the venue radiated brightly under the strong mercury lights: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world and world peace!"

At 2:40 p.m., Prime Minister Münnich and all the Hungarian distinguished guests, accompanied by Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Beijing, and others, entered the venue. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded thunderously, warmly welcoming the distinguished guests from the banks of the Danube. Young Pioneers of the capital presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

The welcoming meeting began after the national anthems of Hungary and China were played. Also present at the meeting were Xi Zhongxun, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhao Erlu, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Zhou Yang, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xiao San, Vice President of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association, Hao Deqing, Chinese Ambassador to Hungary, and responsible persons from relevant departments of the Central Government and Beijing Municipality.

A storm of applause swept the audience.

(Full text on page 3) He said that the unbreakable friendship between the people of Hungary and China and among the socialist countries marks the power of Marxism-Leninism and its irresistible victory.

Vice President Kish Karoly excitedly reported the brilliant achievements made by the Hungarian people in socialist construction. The revolutionary regime of the Hungarian proletariat is now more consolidated than ever. In his speech, he reiterated that the Hungarian people will resolutely oppose modern revisionism represented by Yugoslavia and defend the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Vice President Kish Karoly sternly condemned the various aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to establish military bases and carry out military provocations in Europe and the Far East; and firmly supported the Soviet Union's series of peace proposals on concluding a peace treaty with Germany, transforming West Berlin into a free city, banning nuclear weapons tests, and disarmament.

The Hungarian distinguished guests once again warmly congratulated the Chinese people on their greater achievements in the great leap forward of socialist construction and expressed that the Hungarian people firmly support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and defend the unification of their motherland. The audience of more than 8,000 people applauded warmly for a long time, thanking the distinguished guests for bringing the unparalleled brotherly friendship of the Hungarian people.

Before Vice President Kish Karoly's speech, Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Beijing, first delivered a speech (full text on page 3), extending the most sublime respect to all the distinguished guests and the Hungarian people, warmly congratulating the Hungarian people on the brilliant achievements they have made in socialist construction, and praising their important contributions to strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding world peace.

In his speech, Peng Zhen said that in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the Chinese and Hungarian people are close brothers. In the struggle against the common enemy, we support each other. In the common cause of building socialism, we help each other. The unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people will surely be consolidated and developed day by day.

After the speech, Mayor Peng Zhen presented banners and gifts to Prime Minister Münnich and all the distinguished guests on behalf of the people of the capital. At this moment, all of the 8,000-plus people stood up, and thunderous applause rang out in the venue.

The Hungarian youth, cultural, women's, trade union and other four delegations currently visiting Beijing, as well as the guests of the Hungarian Ballet Troupe, and Hungarian experts and students in Beijing, were invited to attend the meeting. At the welcome meeting, the capital's literary and art circles performed wonderful programs for the distinguished guests.

This morning, Prime Minister Münnich and all members of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, accompanied by Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun and others, visited the Huangtugang People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing and were warmly welcomed.
