Xinhua News Agency, May 1st, Paris dispatch: The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany held two days of secret meetings in Paris on the 29th and 30th to seek a common attitude for the four countries when negotiating with the Soviet Union at the upcoming East-West Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva.

Although there have been several bilateral meetings between Western heads of state and the Western Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Washington in April, the Western countries have not had a unified plan on how to deal with the series of proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to resolve the West Berlin issue, conclude a German peace treaty, and ease tensions in Europe. After this, lower-level officials from these countries held so-called "working group" meetings in London, but still failed to eliminate differences.

The Western Four Foreign Ministers Conference, held on the eve of the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference, was also intended to coordinate the Western attitude, at least on the surface, at this final moment.

After the meeting, a brief and empty communiqué was issued. The communiqué vaguely stated: "The (Western) foreign ministers have reached a complete agreement on their positions at the Geneva conference." As for what agreements were reached on which issues, the communiqué did not mention at all, but only reiterated the "determination" of the West to rely on West Berlin, which it had repeatedly expressed in the past, and the "determination" to "begin negotiations" with the Soviet Union "to establish a just and lasting peace in Europe."

According to Western news agencies, the meeting was originally scheduled to last three or even four days, but it suddenly ended on the 30th. United Press International's Paris correspondent Griggs quoted diplomatic sources as saying that this was because "the West has abandoned the attempt to reach a complete agreement on a detailed blueprint for the Cold War and peace issues before the May 11 Geneva East-West Conference." Thus, the West had to bring a "broad outline of a 'package' plan" for the "urgent German issue" to the Geneva conference.

The West's so-called "package plan" is actually aimed at undermining the possibility of a reasonable solution to the West Berlin issue by exploiting the issue of German reunification, which should be resolved by the Germans themselves. However, according to Western news agencies, the Western four countries encountered "the greatest difficulty" in piecing together such a "package plan." In this regard, according to Reuters, Britain advocated making "various aspects" of this "package plan" "more conducive to negotiation in order to make it possible to reach a limited agreement." Sources said that Britain finally made some concessions, but French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville admitted that there were still differences in approach among the Western four countries.

The Western four foreign ministers have decided to hold another meeting in Geneva on May 10.

    日内瓦东西方外长会议开会在即
    西方四国外长密商对策
    西方通讯社说四国各有打算步调不一
    新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：美、英、法和西德四国外交部长29日和30日在巴黎举行了两天的秘密会议，以谋求四国在即将在日内瓦举行的东西方外长会议上同苏联谈判时的共同态度。
    虽然经过了西方国家首脑多次的双边会谈和4月间在华盛顿举行的西方四国外长会议和北大西洋集团理事会会议，西方国家在如何对待苏联提出的解决西柏林问题、缔结对德和约和缓和欧洲紧张局势的一系列建议这一问题上，一直没有一个意见一致的方案。在这以后，这些国家的较低级官员又在伦敦举行了所谓“工作小组”会议，但是仍然没有消除分歧。
    在东西方外长会议前夕举行的这次西方四国外长会议，也是为了要在这个最后的时刻使西方的态度至少在表面上协调起来。
    会议结束后，发表了一个内容空洞的简短公报。公报笼统地说：“（西方）外长们已经就他们在日内瓦会议上的立场达成完全的协议。”至于到底在哪些问题上达成了什么样的协议，公报却完全没有提，而只是重申西方过去曾经一再表示的要赖在西柏林的“决心”以及所谓“为建立欧洲的公正和持久的和平”而同苏联“开始谈判”的“决心”。
    据西方通讯社说，会议本来要举行三天甚至四天，但是后来却在30日突然结束了。合众国际社驻巴黎记者格里格引用外交人士的话说，这是因为“西方已经放弃了在5月11日日内瓦东西方会议之前就一个详细的关于冷战与和平问题的蓝图达成完全协议的企图”。这样，西方就只好把关于“紧迫的德国问题的‘一揽子’方案的广泛提纲”带到日内瓦会议上去。
    西方的所谓“一揽子方案”，其实是要利用应该由德国人自己解决的重新统一德国的问题来破坏合理解决西柏林等问题的可能性。但是，据西方通讯社透露，西方四国在拼凑这样一个“一揽子方案”时发生了“最大的困难”。在这方面，据路透社说，英国主张使这个
  “一揽子方案”的“各个方面比较便于谈判，以便有可能达成有限的协议”。有消息说，最后英国作了一些让步，但是法国外交部长德姆维尔承认，西方四国在作法上仍然存在分歧。
    西方四国外长已经决定5月10日将在日内瓦再举行一次会议。
