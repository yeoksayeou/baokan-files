Strive for a Cotton Harvest Early On
Check Seedlings and Fill Gaps to Eliminate Missing Plants and Broken Rows Strengthen Management to Ensure Strong and Healthy Seedlings
Old and New Cotton Regions Strengthen Cooperation Seeding Must Be Completed Expediently

This dispatch reports that across the country, more than 60-70% of the cotton planted before Grain Rain has now emerged. All regions have been seizing the cotton planting and preparation work early and well, with most cotton fields meeting the requirements of level ground, sufficient moisture, and adequate fertilizer. As a result, the cotton seedlings are growing more uniformly and robustly than in previous years. In the high-yield demonstration plots in various regions, the cotton seedlings have generally grown one or two true leaves and are growing particularly well. In the early morning, on the fields with neat rows and straight lines, one can see the orderly rows of cotton seedlings tilting slightly towards the rising sun, smiling with the passing morning breeze.

Currently, in the provinces of the Yellow River basin, cotton planting is entering the final stage, and the people's communes are organizing forces to strengthen seedling management. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, the experience of Zhang Qiuxiang's "Hoeing Dream Flowers" has been widely studied, and the cotton seedlings are being cultivated and loosened as soon as they appear. In Gaotang County, Shandong Province, in the "Seize Every Second to Check and Fill Gaps, Ensure Complete Seedlings" and "No Inch of Land Idle" campaign, after criticizing erroneous ideas such as "70% is close to 80%, 70-80% seedlings are acceptable," even the previously vacant headlands and corners were replanted; at the same time, the soil was universally loosened, and those cotton fields planted on bare land will also be fertilized in advance to supplement the base fertilizer. The Xinxiang Special District of Henan Province recently organized the directors of the cotton production increase offices in each county to inspect one million mu of high-yield cotton demonstration plots, and it was considered that the emergence of seedlings was good, seedling management was tightly grasped, pest control was well carried out, and all requirements were met. In the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, the progress of planting in most areas is slower, and they are rushing to plant; in areas where planting has been completed, checking seedlings, replanting, cultivating, and weeding have also been launched.

This year, about 10 million mu of cotton fields across the country are using nutrient pots (blocks) or grid seedling cultivation and transplanting. These cotton seedlings, ready to be transplanted into spring fallow land, have already begun to be transplanted, and the survival rate is very high. These cotton fields will bloom ten to twenty days earlier than ordinary direct-sown cotton, and each plant can produce two to five more early bolls. In Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, individual transplanted cotton seedlings have already begun to bud, and flowers are expected to be seen in early June. In the south, cotton seedlings used for transplanting after the summer harvest and land clearing, as well as "peace seedlings" used for future filling of missing plants in various places, have begun to take measures such as removing insulation equipment and conducting field training to facilitate the normal growth and development of the seedlings.

Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces have expanded their cotton fields by about one-fold this year, developing many new cotton regions. All provinces are paying close attention to supporting planting efforts in the new areas. The Jinhua and Wenzhou special districts of Zhejiang Province are newly developed cotton regions this year, and the province, special districts, and counties have all held planting technology training classes to train a group of technical backbones for the production teams; the province has also organized planting experts from old cotton-producing counties such as Cixi to guide these new cotton regions. Now, the farmers who are planting cotton for the first time in these areas are full of confidence and have proposed challenges to the old cotton-producing counties, expressing their willingness to humbly learn technology from the old cotton-producing areas, create their own cotton production increase experiences in accordance with local conditions, and strive for a harvest in the fall that exceeds the old cotton-producing areas. The Ji'an Special District of Jiangxi Province is also a newly expanded cotton region, and due to insufficient mastery of planting technology, as well as the relatively sticky and humid soil of many new cotton fields converted from rice paddies, there are more dead and missing seedlings; the local people have not lost confidence because of this, and they have adopted the method of early and multiple cultivations to loosen the soil, raise the ground temperature, and protect the cotton seedlings, while checking seedlings, replanting, and transplanting again and again.

Many cotton-producing areas have paid attention to tool reform in order to solve the problem of insufficient labor for fine processing. The farm tool factory in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, has modified a cultivator that is more than three times more efficient than the existing cultivators in the area; the successfully trial-produced sprayer has been put into production, and it is planned to produce 2,000 units in the second quarter. Many people's communes in various places have collected a large number of wild herbal roots, leaves, and bark that were tested last year to protect cotton from pests and diseases; at the same time, they are vigorously producing local fertilizer and adding to and repairing water lifting tools to ensure that cotton is "well-fed and well-watered."

Currently, checking seedlings, replanting, and rushing to complete cotton planting tasks are still very important issues. In the cotton-producing provinces of the Yangtze River basin, intercropping cotton is relatively difficult due to the increased density of wheat, and at the same time, the planting progress has been affected by frequent rains in the previous period, and about 20% of the cotton fields have not been sown. In the provinces of the Yellow River basin, more than 90% of the planting has been completed, but the finishing work is slow. This needs attention. (Attached photo)

### 争取棉花丰收要趁早  查苗补苗消灭缺苗断条  加强管理力求苗壮苗好  老棉区新棉区加强协作  播种未完成的要抓紧进行

    争取棉花丰收要趁早
    查苗补苗消灭缺苗断条  加强管理力求苗壮苗好
    老棉区新棉区加强协作  播种未完成的要抓紧进行
    本报讯  全国各地谷雨前播种的棉花现在已出苗六、七成以上。各地对棉花播种备耕工作抓得早、抓得好，大部棉田都达到了地平、墒饱、肥足的要求，因此棉苗都比往年长得整齐茁壮。各地的园田化丰产方的棉田，现在一般已长出一两片真叶，长得特别好。清晨，在垅齐行直的田野上，可以看到列队整齐的棉苗微微侧向初升的朝阳，随着掠过的晨风微笑。
    目前，黄河流域各省，棉花播种已经进入扫尾阶段，各人民公社正组织力量加强苗期管理。陕西省关中地区普遍学习了张秋香“锄梦花”的经验，棉苗刚显行就进行了中耕松土。山东省高唐县在“分秒必争抓查补，一棵不缺保全苗”和“寸土不闲”的查补运动中，批判了“七成凑八成，七八成苗就对头”等错误想法后，连原先空下的地头地角也补种了；同时，普遍松土一遍，对那些白地播种的棉田，也将提前追肥，补施基肥。河南省新乡专区最近组织各县棉花增产办公室主任对一百万亩丰产方棉田进行了检查，认为出苗好，苗期管理抓得紧、治虫工作搞得好，全部合乎要求。长江流域各省，多数地区播种进度较慢，正在突击抢种中；播种结束的地区，也已展开棉田查苗补种和中耕除草工作。
    今年全国各地搞营养钵（块）或方格育苗移栽的棉田约有一千万亩。这种棉苗，准备移栽到春白地里去，已经开始移栽，成活率很高。这类棉田将比一般直播棉花早开花十天到二十天以上，每株可以多结早桃两个到五个以上。四川省简阳县今年移栽的棉苗个别已经现蕾，预计在6月初旬就可见花。南方为夏收腾地后移栽用的棉苗，以及各地为将来移补缺株用的“太平苗”，都开始采取解除保温装备、进行大田锻炼等措施，以利于棉苗正常地生长发育。
    浙江、江西、安徽等省今年扩大棉田都在一倍左右，发展了不少新棉区。各省都很注意对新区植棉的支援工作。浙江省金华、温州两专区是今年新发展的棉区，省、专、县都分别举办了植棉技术训练班，为生产队培养了一批技术骨干；省里还组织了慈溪等老产棉县的植棉能手到这些新棉区辅导。现在这些地区第一次种棉花的农民群众信心十足，纷纷向老产棉县提出挑战，表示要虚心地向老产棉区学习技术，因地制宜地创造自己的棉花增产经验，力争秋后丰收比过老产棉区。江西省吉安专区也是新扩大的棉区，由于播种技术掌握不够熟练，同时不少由稻田改成的新棉田土壤比较粘重阴湿，死苗缺苗较多；当地群众并不因此丧失信心，他们一面采取了早中耕、多中耕的办法松土，提高地温，保护棉苗，一面一次又一次查苗补种和移栽。
    许多产棉区为了解决加工细作劳动力不足的问题，注意了工具改革。江苏省泗阳县农具厂已改装出一种中耕器，比当地现有的中耕器效率高三倍以上；试制成功的喷雾器，已经投入生产，计划在第二季度内生产二千架。各地许多人民公社大量采集了去年经过试用的野生草药根叶和树皮，保卫棉花不受病虫侵害；同时，大搞土化肥，增添和修补提水工具，要让棉花“吃饱喝足”。
    目前，查苗补种和突击完成棉花播种任务仍然是很重要的问题。长江流域棉区各省因麦类密度加大，套种棉花比较困难，同时前一时期雨水频繁，播种进度受到影响，尚有20％左右的棉田没有下种。黄河流域各省播种已达到90％以上，但扫尾工作迟缓。需要引起注意。（附图片）
