The Fact Is Not What Nehru Said
——A Reader's Letter After Studying Nehru's Speech in the Indian Lok Sabha on April 27

What is "Mutual Respect"?

On April 27, Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a lengthy speech on the Tibetan issue in the Indian Lok Sabha. In his speech, although Prime Minister Nehru used many words to talk about his "concern" for Sino-Indian friendship, this could not conceal the essence of continuing to seriously interfere in China's internal affairs.

Since the Tibetan rebellion, a large number of facts and materials have made the truth of the rebellion clear to the world. Tibet is Chinese territory, and the Tibetan rebellion is purely China's internal affair, in which no foreign country has the right to interfere. Even Prime Minister Nehru, who is "very sympathetic" to Tibet and whose "reflection on anything that happens in Tibet must be very profound," is no exception. However, Prime Minister Nehru said again that the Tibetan rebellion was a "natural manifestation of Tibetan patriotic sentiments," and referred to Tibet as a "nation." Obviously, how can these remarks be regarded as a sign of non-interference in China's internal affairs? How can such an act of openly interfering in the internal affairs of a friendly neighbor and betraying Sino-Indian friendship be described as "measured and courteous"? Especially today, when the Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled and the Tibetan issue has basically come to an end, Prime Minister Nehru is still saying that if the Tibetan rebellion is "entirely the responsibility of some 'upper-class reactionaries' in Tibet, it seems that this statement simplifies a complex situation in an extraordinary way." May I ask, on what basis does Prime Minister Nehru draw this "conclusion"? Could it be that the Chinese people and the Chinese government know less about the ins and outs of the Tibetan issue than a foreign prime minister?

In this speech, Prime Minister Nehru again mentioned the three factors that govern the Indian government's policy, which are aimed at interfering in China's internal affairs: "First, to safeguard India's security and integrity; second, our desire to maintain friendly relations with China; third, our deep sympathy for the Tibetan people." The essence of these three factors is very obvious. May I ask: China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is purely an internal affair and has not affected "India's security and integrity" in the slightest. Prime Minister Nehru groundlessly takes "safeguarding India's security and integrity" as the first factor governing the Indian government's policy. Isn't this obviously unfriendly to the Chinese people? What is even more egregious is that Prime Minister Nehru has stipulated "deep sympathy for the Tibetan people" as a factor governing government policy. As everyone knows, what Prime Minister Nehru sympathizes with and the essence of this sympathy, seems to be much more vague this time than before. In fact, as long as it is linked to his previous speeches, the meaning is still very clear. For example, on April 9, when he talked to the Congress Parliamentary Party about the basis of the Indian government's policy, he concretized this point. It turns out that "sympathy" refers to "maintaining Tibet's autonomy." How could Prime Minister Nehru turn the issue of autonomy in Tibet, which is Chinese territory, into the basis of Indian government policy? It seems that he has really taken out "great imagination." As everyone knows, we have always insisted on unity among all ethnic groups in the country and the unity of the Tibetan people themselves, and advocated the realization of national regional autonomy in Tibet. It is only because of the obstruction of a few Tibetan upper-class traitorous elements that Tibet's autonomy has not been able to be realized smoothly. The issue of Tibet's autonomy is entirely China's internal affair and has nothing to do with foreign countries. Why has Prime Minister Nehru talked about this issue many times in his recent speeches, showing a strong interest, and even regarded it as the basis of Indian government policy?

Prime Minister Nehru said: The "tone of comments and accusations" made by the Chinese people against Indian expansionists "made him feel very sad," and that "if baseless accusations are made and the language of the Cold War is used, this mutual respect will be seriously damaged." And "one of the Five Principles stipulates mutual respect." May I ask, who is using the language of the Cold War? Can the comments and accusations made by the Chinese people to counter the conspiracies of foreign interventionists and to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity be described as "the language of the Cold War"? Nehru's description of the Chinese people's comments and accusations as damage to mutual respect undoubtedly means that only if the Chinese people tolerate this interference can it be considered "mutual respect." Only the Chinese people are allowed to "respect" foreign interference, and no counter-interference is allowed. Indeed, one of the Five Principles stipulates mutual respect, and that is "mutual respect for territorial sovereignty." Without talking about the integrity of territory and sovereignty and non-interference, how can mutual respect be talked about? Is it that the interference of Indian expansionists in Chinese Tibet is the greatest respect for China? In fact, Prime Minister Nehru also said in New Delhi on April 3 that India has not always conformed to this principle, and sometimes "we will forget these principles." As one of the initiators of the Five Principles, how could Prime Minister Nehru not only sometimes forget these principles, but also make such an absurd interpretation of the Five Principles? This cannot but seriously damage the reputation that the respectable Prime Minister Nehru has won in the past.

Prime Minister Nehru's speech on April 27 not only distorted the truth of the Tibetan rebellion, encouraged and supported the Tibetan rebels who were spurned by the Chinese people, but also once again defended the anti-China words and deeds of Indian expansionists. This not only does not help improve Sino-Indian relations, but on the contrary, wins the applause of imperialism. Who does this approach benefit? It is worth Prime Minister Nehru thinking deeply.

### “互相尊重”的是什么？

    事实并不是尼赫鲁所说的那样
    ——读者研究尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院的讲话后的来信
    “互相尊重”的是什么？
    4月27日印度总理尼赫鲁在印度人民院就西藏事件发表了长篇讲话，在讲话中，尽管尼赫鲁总理用了不少词句谈论他对中印友好的“关怀”，但这掩盖不住对中国内政继续进行严重干涉的实质。
    西藏叛乱发生以来，大量的事实和材料已使这次叛乱事件的真相大白于天下。西藏暴乱是中国的领土，西藏叛乱事件纯属中国内政，任何外国都无权加以干涉，即使是对西藏“非常同情”，对“西藏发生的任何事情的反映必然很深刻的”尼赫鲁总理也不能例外。可是尼赫鲁总理却又这样说：西藏暴乱是“西藏爱国情绪自然的流露”，并把西藏说成是一个“国家”。显然，怎么能把这些言论看成是不干涉中国内政的表示？怎么能把这样公然干涉友好邻邦国内事务、背弃中印友好的举动说成是
  “行为有度，彬彬有礼”？特别是当西藏叛乱已被基本平息，西藏问题已经基本结束的今天，尼赫鲁总理却还在说什么如果西藏叛乱事件“完全要由西藏若干‘上层反动分子’负责，看来这种说法是把一种复杂的情况异乎寻常的简单化了。”请问，尼赫鲁总理有什么根据作出这个“结论”？难道对于西藏问题的来龙去脉，中国人民和中国政府还不如一个外国的总理知道得清楚吗？
    尼赫鲁总理在这次讲话中竟又再一次提到旨在干涉中国内政的支配印度政府政策的三个因素：“第一，维护印度的安全和完整；第二，我们跟中国保持友好关系的愿望；第三，我们对西藏人民的深切同情。”这三个因素的实质是十分明显的。请问：中国人民镇压西藏叛乱，纯属内政，毫未影响“印度的安全和完整”，而尼赫鲁总理竟无的放矢的把“维护印度的安全和完整”作为支配印度政府政策的第一个因素，这不是对中国人民明显的不友好吗？更有甚者，尼赫鲁总理竟把“对西藏人民的深切同情”规定为支配政府政策的因素。尽人皆知，尼赫鲁总理是同情些什么，同情的实质是什么，看来尼赫鲁这一次说得比以前含糊多了，其实，只要和他过去几次讲话连系起来看，意思还是很明确的。例如，在4月9日对国大党议会党团谈印度政府政策的基础时他就把这一点具体化了。原来，“同情”指的就是要“保持西藏的自治”。尼赫鲁总理怎么竟把中国的领土西藏的自治问题变成了印度政府政策的基础了呢？看来真是拿出了“很大的想像力”。众所周知，我们一向坚持国内各族人民之间的团结和西藏人民本身的团结，主张在西藏实现民族地方自治，只是由于少数西藏上层叛国分子的阻挠，西藏的自治才没有能够顺利地实现。西藏的自治问题，完全是中国的内政问题，根本与外国无关。为什么尼赫鲁总理最近在谈话中多次谈到这个问题，表现了强烈的兴趣，甚至把它看成是印度政府政策的基础呢？
    尼赫鲁总理说：中国人民对印度扩张主义分子所作的：“评论和指责的语调”使他“感到非常难过”，说什么“如果提出毫无根据的指责，使用冷战的语言，这种互相尊重就要受到严重的损害。”而“五项原则之中就有一项规定互相尊重。”请问，到底是谁在使用冷战的语言？难道能把中国人民为了反击外国干涉者的阴谋，捍卫本国主权和领土完整所作的评论和指责说成是“冷战的语言”吗？尼赫鲁把中国人民的这种评论和指责说成是对互相尊重的损害，这无疑就是说，只有中国人民容忍这种干涉才算是“互相尊重”。只许中国人民“尊重”外国的干涉，而不许进行反干涉。不错，五项原则之中是有一项规定互相尊重，这就是“互相尊重领土主权”。不谈领土和主权的完整和互不干涉，互相尊重又从何谈起？是不是印度扩张主义分子对中国西藏的干涉才是对中国最大的尊重呢？其实，尼赫鲁4月3日在新德里也曾说过，印度并不是始终符合这种原则的，有时候“我们就会忘掉这些原则。”作为五项原则创议者之一的尼赫鲁总理，怎么不仅会有时忘记这种原则，而且竟对五项原则作出这样荒诞的解释呢？这不能不使可敬的尼赫鲁总理过去所赢得的声誉受到严重的损害。
    尼赫鲁总理4月27日的讲话，不仅对西藏叛乱事件的真相作了歪曲，鼓励和支持了为中国人民所唾弃的西藏叛匪，也再一次为印度扩张主义分子的反华言行进行了辩护，这就不仅无助于中印关系的改善，相反，却得到帝国主义的喝采叫好。这种做法到底对谁有利？值得尼赫鲁总理深思。　国际关系学院　齐　放
