Mobilizing All People to Eradicate Locust Plagues
Anhui, Shandong, and Other Provinces Formulate Locust Control Plans

　　Following the Ministry of Agriculture's convening of a locust control conference for the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu in Jinan, Shandong in early April, Shandong, Anhui, and Hebei provinces successively convened provincial-level locust control conferences. These meetings implemented the spirit of the five-province locust control conference and formulated locust control plans based on the specific conditions of each province.

    Anhui Province, starting now, will organize three major campaigns: The first campaign, before the wheat harvest, will organize large-scale operations to fiercely combat summer locusts, requiring the locust areas along the Huai River and around the lakes to eliminate locust nymphs before the third instar, and the waterlogged locust areas to eliminate them during the hatching stage. The second campaign will combine with the wheat harvest, organizing professional teams to sweep up the remaining locusts, ensuring that as each field is harvested, it is also swept clean, and that when the wheat harvest is complete, the remaining locusts are also eliminated. The third campaign will thoroughly eliminate autumn locusts, ensuring that the main force of autumn locusts is eliminated by early August, followed by continuous sweeping of the remaining locusts.

    Shandong Province strives to eradicate locust plagues within three to four years. The specific steps are to eradicate locust areas affected by waterlogging within one to two years, eradicate locust areas along the lakes within two to three years, and eradicate coastal locust areas within three to four years. To mobilize the entire Party and all the people to actively participate in the locust control struggle and ensure the realization of this plan, they will criticize the conservative thinking that "locusts can be controlled but not eradicated" and the complacent and paralyzed sentiment that "there are not many locusts, there will be no trouble" through accounting comparisons and debates, and establish the confidence and determination to eradicate locust plagues.

    While vigorously eliminating locusts, it is also necessary to combine with water conservancy construction, changes in farming systems, and the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, to achieve water conservancy, river network, garden field, and landscaping as soon as possible, and eliminate locust breeding grounds.

    Hebei Province is holding a locust control conference, and Jiangsu Province has also made arrangements for the eradication of locust plagues. They have all successively established locust control headquarters at all levels, seizing the opportunity to strike hard against summer locusts.

　　全民动手　根绝蝗害
    安徽山东等省订出灭蝗规划
    本报讯　农业部于4月上旬在山东济宁召开了河北、山东、河南、安徽、江苏五省灭蝗会议以后，山东、安徽、河北三省先后召开了全省灭蝗会议，贯彻执行五省治蝗会议的精神，并且根据本省具体情况制订了灭蝗规划。
    安徽省从现在开始，要组织三大战役：第一战役在麦收前组织大兵团作战，狠打夏蝗，要求沿淮滨湖蝗区把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前，内涝蝗区消灭在孵化阶段；第二战役结合麦收，组织专业队扫残，做到收一块扫一块，麦收完，扫荡残蝗完；第三战役彻底消灭秋蝗，八月上旬一定要消灭秋蝗主力，紧接着连续扫荡残蝗。
    山东省力争在三、四年内根除蝗害，具体步骤是一、二年根除内涝蝗区，二、三年根除沿湖蝗区，三、四年根除滨海蝗区。为了发动全党全民积极投入灭蝗斗争，保证这一规划的实现，他们将通过算账对比、辩论的方式，批判“蝗虫可治不可绝”的保守思想和“蝗虫不多了，不会出乱子”的自满麻痹情绪，树立根除蝗害的信心和决心。
    大力消灭蝗虫的同时，还要结合水利建设、改变耕作制度和农林牧副渔的全面发展，尽早实现水利化、河网化、园田化、园林化，消灭蝗虫发生基地。
    河北省正在举行灭蝗会议，江苏省对根除蝗害工作也做了布置。他们都已先后成立了各级灭蝗指挥部，掌握时机，痛击夏蝗。
