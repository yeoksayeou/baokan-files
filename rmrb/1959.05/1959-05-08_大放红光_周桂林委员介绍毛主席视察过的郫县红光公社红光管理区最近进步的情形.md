“Radiating Red Light”
Committee Member Zhou Guilin Introduces the Recent Progress of the Hongguang Management Area of the Hongguang Commune in Pi County, Which Chairman Mao Visited

Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I fully endorse and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of the other leading comrades. On March 16, 1958, our beloved leader Chairman Mao came to our Hongguang Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative (now the Hongguang People's Commune) in Pi County, Sichuan, to inspect our work. At that time, Chairman Mao encouraged me and the cooperative members, saying, "Hongguang Cooperative is radiating red light." After the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the realization of rural people's communes, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, and through the hard work and dedication of all the cadres and members, it truly "radiated red light." Now, I will report to the committee members on the areas in which the former Hongguang Cooperative, now the Hongguang Management Area, has radiated "red light."

In terms of production, the average yield of rice per mu in the entire management area reached 1,786 jin in 1958. In 1959, we plan to strive to double the yield on the basis of 1958. Chairman Mao once inspected our wheat and rapeseed. At that time, Chairman Mao repeatedly asked me and the cooperative members, "Can wheat and rapeseed grow better?" The fact is that they really did grow better. 1958 was better than 1957, and this year is even better than last year. The yield of rapeseed in 1958 was 130 jin per mu, an increase of 20% compared to 1957. This year, the preliminary estimate is that each mu can reach 300 jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year. The rapeseed field that Chairman Mao inspected is called "Happiness Field" by us. Last year, the yield per mu reached 170 jin. This year, the seedlings are taller than people, and the estimated yield per mu may reach about 700 jin.

While developing the production of grain and oil crops, diversified economic activities have also made great leaps forward. The number of piglets has increased from more than 1,500 in 1958 to more than 3,000 now, an average of more than three per household. Fish farming covers more than 30 mu, and this year's income may reach 100,000 yuan. Planting fruit trees, nurseries, and flowers covers more than 50 mu, and this year's income may reach about 30,000 yuan.

In addition, we have also built a small hydroelectric power station. In addition to processing grain and feed for our own cooperative, we also process rice for the state and have installed electric lights. This not only saves labor and increases income, but also greatly inspires the masses' confidence and determination to build socialism.

Now, the living standards of the commune members have greatly improved. The commune members say, "Cooperativization changed our lives from poor to rich, and communization made us even richer." Now, not only can we eat our fill and dress warmly, but most commune members have two sets of new clothes, and some even wear silk undershirts. The living conditions of the commune members are gradually improving. We plan to build housing for 300 households, and new houses that can accommodate 30 households have already been built.

When Chairman Mao came to our Hongguang Cooperative last year, he said, "Hongguang Cooperative is radiating red light." This remark greatly encouraged our cadres and members. The commune members said, "We must firmly remember the words that Hongguang Cooperative is radiating red light. If production is not done well, there will be no light." Therefore, the commune members are full of spirit and soaring enthusiasm. Like Lin Saihua, whom Chairman Mao visited, she is so old, but this year she still wants to work on sweet potato experimental fields and ran to Jianyang County to learn techniques. Another example is Wu Erniang, who is fifty years old. When the Chairman came to inspect, she was replanting hemp seedlings. The Chairman shook her mud-covered hand, and she was greatly encouraged. Now she takes care of children in the nursery, and everyone says she is good. The commune members are all willing to entrust their children to her care, so she was rated as a model worker. There is also the old man Wang Zhengyun, who in the past the commune members complained was "fond of going to the streets," but now they say he is "very diligent." Such examples are endless.

In terms of the work style of the cadres, the past shortcomings such as not going deep into the work, not consulting with the masses enough on matters, and the simplicity and rigidity of some comrades have now been greatly improved, and their work has begun to be arduous and in-depth. They have learned the working method of grasping both ends and leading the middle. For example, among the 25 production teams in the entire management area, there were six backward teams. We divided the work and assigned specific people to help them. Now there are no backward teams. In particular, the originally backward 25th team has made great progress after specific assistance. It won the red flag three times in the autumn, winter, and spring last year.

The above is just a brief report on some of the main aspects. Of course, there are many, many things that have not been mentioned. Although we have made some achievements in production, we will never be arrogant or complacent. Currently, everyone is working hard to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and strive to emit even greater "red light" in production.

### “大放红光”  周桂林委员介绍毛主席视察过的郫县红光公社红光管理区最近进步的情形

　　“大放红光”
    周桂林委员介绍毛主席视察过的郫县红光公社红光管理区最近进步的情形主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护和赞成周总理的政府工作报告和其他几位首长的报告。在一九五八年三月十六日，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，到我们四川郫县红光高级农业生产合作社（现在是红光人民公社）来视察工作。当时毛主席鼓励我和社员们说：“红光社大放红光。”经过一九五八年的大跃进和农村人民公社化的实现，在上级党委的领导下，经过全体干部、社员的大干、苦干，就真的“大放红光”了。我现在仅就原来的红光社、现在的红光管理区是在那些方面放了“红光”向各位委员汇报一下。
    在生产方面，全管理区一九五八年水稻亩产量平均达到一千七百八十六斤，一九五九年我们计划在一九五八年的基础上争取产量再翻一番。毛主席曾看过我们的小麦和油菜，当时毛主席一再问我和社员：“小麦、油菜能不能长得更好”。事实也就真的长的更好，一九五八年比一九五七年好，今年又比去年好。油菜一九五八年亩产一百三十斤，比一九五七年增产百分之二十，今年初步估产每亩可达三百斤，比去年增产一倍以上。毛主席看过的那块油菜田，我们叫它“幸福田”，去年亩产达到一百七十斤，今年苗儿长的比人还高，估计每亩产量可能达到七百斤左右。
    在发展粮食、油料生产的同时，多种经济也有很大的跃进。猪仔由一九五八年的一千五百多头，现在增加到三千多头，每户平均三头多，养鱼三十多亩，今年可收入十来万元。种果树、苗圃、鲜花共五十多亩，今年可收入三万元左右。
    此外，我们还修建了一个小型水力发电站，除为本社加工粮食饲料外，还为国家加工稻谷，并且还安上了电灯。不但节约了劳动力，增加了收入，还大大鼓舞了群众建设社会主义的信心和决心。
    现在社员的生活水平已大大的提高了。社员们说：“合作化我们的生活由穷变富，公社化是富上加富。”现在不但能吃饱穿暖，而且多数社员都有两套新衣服，有的还穿上丝绸汗衫。社员的居住条件正逐步在改善中，我们计划修三百户人家的住房，现在已修建了能住三十户人家的新房屋。
    毛主席去年到我们红光社时说：“红光社大放红光”，这话给我们干部和社员的鼓舞很大。社员们说：“红光社大放红光的话我们要牢牢地记在心里，生产搞不好就无光了。”所以社员们意气风发，干劲冲天。像毛主席访问过的林赛花，那么大年纪今年还要搞红苕试验田，并跑到简阳县去学习技术。再像五十岁的伍二娘，主席去视察时，她正在补麻苗，主席握了握她那沾满泥巴的手，她受到极大的鼓励。她现在在托儿所带孩子，人人说好，社员们都愿意把自己的孩子交给她带，因此被评为模范。还有王正云老汉过去社员反映他“好上街”，现在说他“好勤快”。像这样的事例是说不完的。
    在干部作风上，过去那种工作不深入，有事和群众商量不够和某些同志的简单、生硬等缺点，现在都有很大的改进，他们的工作开始艰苦深入了。学会了抓两头、带中间的工作方法。比如全管理区二十五个生产队当中，有六个落后队，我们就分工包干具体帮助，现在没有落后队了。特别是原来落后的第二十五队，经过具体帮助后，进步很大，在去年秋季、冬季和今年春季得了三次红旗。
    以上，仅就一些主要的汇报一下，没讲的事情当然还有很多很多的。我们虽然在生产上做出了点成绩，但是，决不骄傲自满，目前大家正在鼓足干劲，争取一九五九年更大、更好、更全面的跃进，争取在生产上放出更大的“红光”。
