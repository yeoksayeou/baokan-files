Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 12th—TASS reports: The East-West Foreign Ministers Conference opened at 6:00 PM local time on the 11th in the Palais des Nations in Geneva.

    Before the opening of the first session, Western countries suddenly attempted to limit or even completely deprive the representatives of the German people of their right to participate in the conference. This violated the clear agreement reached by the Four Powers during the preparation of the conference that representatives of the two Germanys should participate.
    The Soviet delegation firmly opposed this attempt by Western countries. The Western countries attempted to deprive the Germans of effectively participating in a conference whose mission was to discuss issues of vital interest to all German people. The attempt to prevent the Germans from sitting at the negotiating table failed. This is a major victory for Soviet policy, which has consistently and resolutely defended the right of Germans to actively participate in the Geneva conference from the very beginning.
    At precisely 6:00 PM local time, the delegations of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the German Democratic Republic, and the Federal Republic of Germany took their seats in the conference hall.
    The Soviet side participating in the conference included: the head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, delegation members Zorin, Malik, Biryuzin, Smirnov, Soldatov, as well as the Soviet Ambassador to France, Vinogradov, and delegation advisors.
    The U.S. representatives attending the conference were: U.S. Secretary of State Herter, as well as Merchant, Thompson, and others.
    The United Kingdom was represented by: Foreign Secretary Lloyd, as well as Rumbold, Hancock, and others.
    France was represented by: Foreign Minister Couve de Murville, as well as Joxe, Lucet, and others.
    The delegation of the German Democratic Republic was led by the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz. The delegation members were: Winzer, Toeplitz, and Florin.
    Representing the Federal Republic of Germany were: the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the United States, Grewe, and other members of the delegation.
    After UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld congratulated the participants, the executive chairman of the first session, Lloyd, in a brief speech, expressed his hope that this conference would be a turning point in the development of East-West relations and would help enhance mutual understanding between the participating countries.
    The participants agreed that the next meeting would be held at 3:30 PM local time on May 12.

    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 11th (Reporter Peng Di) reports: The East-West Foreign Ministers Conference opened here at the Palais des Nations. In addition to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany also effectively participated in the conference. This is the first time that representatives of the German Democratic Republic have participated in a foreign ministers conference held between the East and West.
    Western countries have made various attempts to diminish the growing influence of the German Democratic Republic, including refusing to sit with the two Germanys on an equal footing, employing procedural tactics to limit the speaking rights of the two German delegations, and discriminating against the two delegations by not recognizing German as an official language of the conference. They even opposed the Soviet proposal to use a round table for the conference, insisting on using a rectangular table, with the Four Powers seated on each side.
    Western journalists hoping for the failure of the conference have been sending out news one after another from the press center here, pointing out that the conference would definitely be postponed. Evening newspapers used large headlines to publicize that the conference had reached a "stalemate" or a "dead end."
    Thanks to the patient efforts of the Soviet delegation, an agreement was reached at the last moment. Despite Western obstruction, the delegations of the two Germanys are now sitting together with the delegations of the four other countries facing each other in a circle. The only real difference is that the two Germanys are seated next to the round table at two additional tables.
    However, the fact that the Foreign Ministers Conference opened today shows that neither the stubborn attitude of the United States nor the sabotage of West Germany can prevent the progress of peace. (Attached picture)

### 东西方外长会议在日内瓦开幕  苏联挫败西方阻挠德国的代表参加会议的阴谋

    东西方外长会议在日内瓦开幕
    苏联挫败西方阻挠德国的代表参加会议的阴谋
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社日内瓦讯：东西方外长会议于11日当地时间十八时在日内瓦的国联大厦开幕。
    在第一次会议开幕以前，西方国家突然企图限制，甚至完全剥夺德国人民的代表参加会议工作的权利。这违背了四大国在会议筹备过程中所达成的关于两个德国的代表应当参加会议的明确协议。
  苏联代表团坚决反对西方国家的这种企图。西方国家企图剥夺德国人有效地参加会议的权利，而这个会议的使命是讨论同全体德国人民有切身利害关系的问题。不让德国人坐到谈判桌子旁边来的企图失败了，这是苏联政策的重大胜利，苏联一开始就坚决维护德国人积极参加日内瓦会议的权利。
    当地时间十八时正，苏联、美国、英国、法国以及德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表团在会议大厅各就各位。
    苏联方面参加会议的是：苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯，代表团团员佐林、马立克、别尔乌辛、斯米尔诺夫、索尔达托夫，还有苏联驻法国大使维诺格拉多夫和代表团顾问。
    出席会议的美国代表是：美国国务卿赫脱，以及麦钱特、汤普森等。
    英国的代表是：外交大臣劳埃德，以及朗博尔德、汉考克等。
    法国的代表是：外交部长德姆维尔，以及若克斯、吕克等。
    德意志民主共和国代表团由德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨率领。代表团成员是：文策尔、特普利茨、弗洛林。
    代表德意志联邦共和国的是：德意志联邦共和国驻美国大使格雷韦和代表团其他成员。
    在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德向与会者表示祝贺后，第一次会议的执行主席劳埃德在简短致词中表示希望这次会议将是在东西方关系发展中的一个转折性的会议，并将有助于增进与会国家之间的互相了解。
    与会者议定下次会议在5月12日当地时间十五时三十分召开。
    据新华社日内瓦11日电  本社记者彭迪报道：东西方外长会议在这里的国联大厦开幕，除了苏联、英国、法国和美国以外，德意志民主共和国及德意志联邦共和国也有效地参加了会议。德意志民主共和国的代表参加东西方之间举行的外长会议，这还是第一次。
    西方国家为了缩小德意志民主共和国日益增长的影响进行了种种尝试，这包括拒绝同两个德国在平等资格的基础上并坐在一起，施用了限制两个德国代表团发言权的程序上的策略，并且歧视这两个代表团，不承认德语为会议的正式语言。他们甚至反对苏联提出的关于会议使用圆桌的建议，坚持使用方桌，由四大国各据一边。
    希望这次会议失败的西方记者们从这里的记者中心接二连三赶发消息，指出会议肯定延期。各晚报用大字标题宣传会议遭到“僵局”或走入“死胡同”。
    由于苏联代表团耐心的努力，在最后的时刻取得了协议。尽管西方进行阻挠，两个德国的代表团现在已同面对面围成一圈的四个其他国家的代表团坐在一起。唯一实际的差别是两个德国坐在靠近圆桌的另外两张桌子的旁边。
    但是，外长会议今天开幕这一事实表明，不论美国的顽固态度和西德的破坏都不能阻止和平的进展。（附图片）
