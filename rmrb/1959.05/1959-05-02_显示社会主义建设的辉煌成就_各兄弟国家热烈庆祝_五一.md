She called on the Korean working people to continue to move forward and complete the first Five-Year Plan more than two years ahead of schedule, before "August 15" this year. She emphasized that U.S. troops must withdraw from South Korea as soon as possible. She said that we have made all preparations to welcome Korean residents in Japan to return home, and the Japanese authorities should show sincerity and repatriate Korean residents as soon as possible. She also said that we must combat revisionism and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism.
    After the rally, the parade began.

    On behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, and the people, he expressed support for the South Vietnamese patriots who are fighting heroically.

However, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the South Vietnamese authorities have violated the Geneva Accords, undermined the people's democratic freedoms, made the South Vietnamese economy increasingly depressed, and the people's lives increasingly impoverished. The United States and Ngo Dinh Diem cruelly suppress our compatriots, but they cannot subdue the people of South Vietnam. On the contrary, they can only make the people of South Vietnam more united in opposing U.S. imperialism.
    President Ho Chi Minh said: The entire people of Vietnam must further consolidate their unity with the socialist brother countries headed by the great Soviet Union, further develop friendship with neighboring countries, Asian and African countries and the peace-loving people of the world, strengthen the national united front, actively participate in patriotic emulation, and victoriously complete this year's plan, which is the most crucial year of the three-year plan, so that North Vietnam will steadily move towards socialism and become a solid foundation for the struggle for the reunification of the motherland.
