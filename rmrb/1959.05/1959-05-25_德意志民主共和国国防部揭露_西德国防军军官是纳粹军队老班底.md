Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 23rd: According to TASS, the German News Agency published a statement by a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic, exposing the attempt by the West German delegation in Geneva to deny the rampant activities of militarism in West Germany and the fact that former Hitler generals control the West German Bundeswehr.

The spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense pointed out that West German Defense Minister Strauss once said that the officer corps of the Bundeswehr—from captain to the highest-ranking officers—was mostly composed of former Hitler officers, and that more than one hundred generals in the Bundeswehr had received the highest Nazi medals.

The statement pointed out that war criminals in the West German Bundeswehr are not limited to Heusinger, Speidel, and Kammhuber. For example, Von Behr, who served as the Chief of Staff of the "Hermann Göring" Corps during the Hitler era and is now a brigadier general in the Bundeswehr; Major General Trettner, a division commander in Hitler's Wehrmacht and currently head of a department at NATO headquarters; and Rear Admiral Rogge, who once trained Hitler's naval officers, should be included in the list of war criminals.

The statement pointed out that, with the help of the West German government, West Germany has also established a large number of fascist military alliances engaged in revanchist propaganda.

The statement concluded by saying that the West German authorities' attempt to cover up these facts once again shows that it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and deprive German militarism of its power so that the German people and the people of European countries can be freed from the threat of war.

    德意志民主共和国国防部揭露
    西德国防军军官是纳粹军队老班底
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社柏林22日讯：德意志通讯社发表了德意志民主共和国国防部发言人的声明，揭露西德在日内瓦的代表团企图否认军国主义在西德活动猖獗和前希特勒将领把持西德国防军的事实。
    国防部发言人指出，西德国防部长施特劳斯曾经说，联邦国防军的军官团——从上尉至最高的军官——绝大部分都由前希特勒的军官组成，联邦国防军有一百多名将军曾得过纳粹最高奖章。
    声明指出，西德国防军中的战犯不止是豪辛格、斯派达尔和卡姆胡贝尔等。例如，曾在希特勒时期担任“赫尔曼·戈林”军团参谋长、现为联邦国防军准将的冯·贝尔，希特勒国防军师长、现任北大西洋公约组织总部某处处长特莱特纳少将，曾为希特勒海军训练干部的海军少将罗格等人就应当被列入战犯名单中。
    声明指出，在西德政府的帮助下，西德还成立了大量从事复仇主义宣传的法西斯军人联盟。
    声明最后说，西德当局掩盖这些事实的企图再一次表明，必须缔结对德和约并剥夺德国军国主义的权力，以使德国人民和欧洲各国人民摆脱战争的威胁。
