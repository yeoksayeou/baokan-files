Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The full text of the farewell speech by First Vice-Chairman Materne at the airport is as follows: Respected Comrade Zhu De, dear comrades and friends:

　　We have gained very deep impressions during our stay in the People's Republic of China, and today we are about to part with you. As we leave you, we are fully aware that 10,000 kilometers away from our motherland, we have a loyal and reliable ally – the Chinese people, who stand with us like brothers in our struggle. Yesterday's enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress once again movingly demonstrated that the friendship between the people of our two countries and the unity of the socialist camp are unbreakable and constantly developing.

　　After returning to our country, we will report to the people of the German Democratic Republic the great achievements made by the glorious Chinese people in socialist construction. We are deeply impressed by the great achievements and the enthusiasm and creativity shown by the fraternal Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party in solving domestic tasks.

　　During our trip to the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries in Asia, we clearly realized that the representatives of the German Democratic Republic sent to Geneva are not isolated in their struggle for a just solution to the vital issues of the German nation. The fact that the hundreds of millions of people in the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, are united in supporting the German people's demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two German states is an encouragement to us and makes it our duty to redouble our efforts in the struggle.

　　Dear comrades and friends! On behalf of the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, I thank the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and all the Chinese people for their warm welcome and friendly reception.

　　I wish the Chinese people great achievements in the cause of further building socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party that has enabled the Chinese people to achieve great achievements!

　　Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people!

　　Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the common struggle to safeguard world peace!

    马特恩副主席的讲话
    新华社12日讯  马特恩第一副主席在机场上的告别讲话，全文如下：敬爱的朱德同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们在中华人民共和国逗留期间得到了非常深刻的印象，今天我们要同你们分别了。在离开你们的时候，我们心里完全明白，在距离我们祖国一万公里的地方，我们有着忠实可靠的同盟者——中国人民，在我们的斗争中，他们和我们兄弟般地站在一起。昨天举行的全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议又一次动人地表明了我们两国人民之间的友谊和社会主义阵营的团结一致是不可动摇的，是在不断发展着的。
    我们回到祖国以后，将向德意志民主共和国的人民报告光荣的中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就。兄弟的中国人民在共产党的领导下，在解决国内任务中所取得的伟大成就和显示出来的热情和创造力，使我们感到非常钦佩。
    我们这次在中华人民共和国和亚洲其他社会主义国家的旅行中清楚地体会到，派到日内瓦去的德意志民主共和国的代表，在他们为公正地解决德意志民族切身问题的斗争中，并不孤立。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营千千万万群众，团结一致地支持德国人民关于同两个德国缔结和约的要求，这个肯定的事实对我们是一种鼓舞，并且使我们有责任加倍努力，进行斗争。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！我代表德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团感谢全国人民代表大会常务委员会和全体中国人民给予我们十分热烈的欢迎和友好的接待。
    祝中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在进一步建设社会主义的事业中取得伟大成就！
    伟大的中国人民和使中国人民获得伟大成就的中国共产党万岁！
    中德两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致和维护世界和平的共同斗争万岁！
