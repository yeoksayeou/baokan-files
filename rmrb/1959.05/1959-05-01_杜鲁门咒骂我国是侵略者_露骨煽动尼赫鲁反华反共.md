Xinhua News Agency, 30th: New York dispatch: Former US President Truman, who launched the Korean War, has grossly slandered China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and is provoking Asian countries to oppose China.

    This chief culprit of aggression, who was severely hit by the Chinese people, published an article in the "New York Times" on the 28th, viciously cursing China as "imperialist" and "aggressor." He described the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, a purely internal affair of China, as "the most rampant action of Communist imperialism" occurring at the door of India. He then pretended to sympathize with India's so-called "dilemma and the dangers it faces" and blatantly incited India to rise up against communism. He wants Nehru to recognize "the folly of his neutralism" and to "strengthen his strength and influence to oppose" international communism.

    On the same day, the "National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America" openly advocated in a "resolution" that imperialist countries should take further actions to interfere in China's internal affairs. It clamored that the West should not "sit idly by" while the Tibetan rebellion is being put down, but should provide "relief and assistance" to "encourage" the remaining Tibetan rebels. This reactionary organization even offered suggestions to the US government, suggesting that the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique should come forward to provoke and interfere with China's exercise of sovereignty over Tibet, and clamored for the US government to remove the shackles of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to deal with the mainland.

    The head of the American "Veterans of Foreign Wars", Mahan, advocated that the US government should "promptly recognize" a so-called Tibetan "government-in-exile" as a stepping stone for further interference in China's internal affairs in the future.

    杜鲁门咒骂我国是侵略者
    露骨煽动尼赫鲁反华反共
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：发动侵朝战争的美国前总统杜鲁门对中国平定西藏叛乱大肆诬蔑，并且挑拨亚洲国家反对中国。
    这个受到中国人民沉重打击的侵略元凶28日在“纽约时报”发表一篇文章，恶毒咒骂中国是“帝国主义”和“侵略者”。他把中国政府平定西藏叛乱这样一个纯属中国内政的行动说成是在印度门口发生的“共产帝国主义的最嚣张的行动”，接着就假装同情所谓印度目前“进退两难的处境和面临的危险”，并且露骨地挑拨印度起来反共。他要尼赫鲁认识到“他的中立主义的愚蠢”，并且要他“加强他的力量和影响来反对”国际共产主义。
    同一天，“美国基督教会”理事会在一份“决议”中公然鼓吹帝国主义国家应进一步采取行动来干涉中国内政。它叫嚣西方不应“坐视”西藏叛乱被平定下去，而应该提供“救济和援助”以“鼓励”西藏残余的叛乱分子。这个反动组织甚至向美国政府献计，让南朝鲜李承晚集团出面来进行挑拨，以干涉中国对西藏地方行使主权，还叫嚣要美国政府撤除台湾蒋介石集团的束缚来对付大陆。
    美国“国外战争退伍军人协会”头子马汉鼓吹美国政府应当“迅速承认”一个所谓西藏“流亡政府”，作为今后进一步干涉中国内政的垫脚石。
