Cotton Production Target Implementation: Team Members Strive to Exceed Production

Kunming, May 27th (reporting from our newspaper) - The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the different production conditions and production levels of different regions, has implemented cotton production targets on a basis that can be exceeded, thus greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to strive for overproduction.

The cotton sowing quality in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture this year is relatively good. After continuous disaster resistance and seedling protection work, basically full emergence has been achieved, and the growth is good. As long as solid management work centered on disaster resistance and boll protection is done in the future, it can be guaranteed that the prefecture's 110,000 mu of cotton will yield 44 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

The cotton production targets of this autonomous prefecture vary according to the specific conditions between counties, cotton-growing areas, and production teams. The targets contracted to production teams can be roughly divided into three types: one is those with a cotton planting foundation and good production conditions, such as the Nujiang District and state-owned farms in Baoshan County, where the production target is 55 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the production target for Luoming District is 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The second is general areas, such as Dingjie District in Changning County, with a contracted yield of 40 jin per mu. The third is new cotton-growing areas and areas with poor production conditions, such as Puqiao Commune in Baoshan County, which is a new cotton-growing area this year, with a contracted yield of 30 jin per mu. The implementation of the contract adopts two methods: Baoshan stipulates that all overproduction belongs to the production team; Changning stipulates that for yields within 100 jin per mu, the brigade gets 20% of the overproduction and the production team gets 80%; for yields above 100 jin per mu, all belongs to the production team. This is conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses and striving to complete and strive to overfulfill the production plan. The effect of this kind of contract method has been very good after more than a month of practice. Production teams and the masses are very satisfied with this method and generally have the confidence to exceed the production target. At present, all communes in the autonomous prefecture are carrying out cotton disaster resistance, seedling protection, and mid-tillage processing and management work, and all work is being done more conscientiously and practically than in the past. After the contract targets and methods were conveyed to the Songlin Production Team of the Yulin Commune in Changning County, they immediately concentrated their labor force into cotton field management and achieved full emergence in a short time. After the Maojie Brigade of the Hujie Commune implemented the contract method, the commune members took the initiative to go to work early and return late, and the labor efficiency was also greatly improved. Production teams everywhere believe that the production contract is implemented and feel that there is production to exceed, so they are very motivated.

The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the experience of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in implementing production contracts and has notified various places to refer to it for trial implementation. (Tian Lianggeng)

    德宏傣族景颇族自治州
    棉花包产指标落实各队社员力争超产
    本报昆明27日电  中共云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州委根据不同地区的生产条件和生产水平，使棉花包产指标在可以超过的基础上落实，因而大大调动了群众力争超产的积极性。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州今年棉花播种质量较好。播种后，经过持续的抗灾保苗工作，基本上达到了全苗，生长良好，今后只要踏实地做好以抗灾保桃为中心的管理工作，可以保证全州十一万亩棉花亩产四十四斤皮棉的任务。
    这个自治州的棉花包产指标，根据县与县、棉区与棉区、生产队与生产队之间的具体条件有高有低。包干到生产队的指标大体上可分为三种：一是植棉有基础和生产条件好的，如保山县的怒江区和国营农场，包产指标是每亩产皮棉五十五斤；罗明区的包产指标每亩产皮棉六十斤。二是一般地区，如昌宁县叮街区亩产包四十斤。三是新棉区和生产条件差的地区，如保山县普桥公社，是今年新植棉区，亩产包三十斤。包产落实采取两个办法：保山规定：超产部分全部归生产队所有；昌宁规定：亩产在一百斤以内的，超产部分大队得二成、生产队得八成；亩产在一百斤以上的，全部归生产队所有。这样就有利于发挥群众的积极性，努力地去完成和力争超额完成包产计划。这样的包产办法，经过一个多月的实践证明效果很好。生产队和群众对这种办法非常满意，普遍有信心超过包产指标。现在自治州各公社正在进行棉花抗灾保苗、中耕加工管理工作，各项工作做的比过去认真踏实了。昌宁县鱼鳞公社松林生产队当包干指标和办法传达下去后，立即将劳动力集中投入棉田管理，在短时间内做到了全苗。虎街公社猫街大队贯彻包干办法以后，社员们主动地早出工，晚收工，劳动效率也大大提高了。各地生产队都认为包产是落实的，感到有产可超，因此劲头很大。
    中共云南省委很重视德宏傣族景颇族自治州的包产落实的经验，已通报各地参照试行。（田良耕）
