Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 23rd. Our correspondent reports: In the eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, despite various obstructions and sabotage by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have still overcome various difficulties and made many achievements in helping the Tibetan people with economic and cultural construction, doing many good things for the Tibetan people, and have been sincerely loved by the Tibetan people.
　　Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, there were no highways from Tibet to the mainland, only rugged post roads and trails. Tibetan people relied entirely on livestock or cowhide boats for transportation. After liberation, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, Han workers, and Tibetan people worked together, shedding blood and sweat, conquering high mountains and glaciers, and building more than 7,000 kilometers of highways and motor vehicle trails. The famous Kangzang, Qingzang, and Xinzang highways have connected Tibet with fraternal ethnic regions in the mainland, fundamentally changing Tibet's long-term state of traffic blockage. Several highway trunk lines from Lhasa to Shigatse, Shigatse to Gyantse, Gyantse to Yadong, Heihe to Ali, and Bangda to Ningjing have also been completed. In the past, it took three months to ride a horse from Tibet to the mainland; now, it only takes seven days by car. The distance from eastern to western Tibet is more than 3,000 kilometers; in the past, a round trip took two years. Now, from the Three Rivers (Jinsha River, Nujiang River, Lancang River) basin in eastern Tibet to Gada Ke on the Ali Plateau in western Tibet, from the northern Tibetan grasslands to Yadong on the northern foothills of the Himalayas, cars can pass through. The highway lines of the eight Kikhyi (equivalent to prefectures) have all been connected, making it very convenient for farmers and herdsmen to travel. The exchange of goods between Tibet and the mainland, as well as within Tibet, has also been greatly strengthened due to the improvement of transportation conditions. The price of tea, which is indispensable to the lives of Tibetan people, used to be manipulated by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, and the Tibetan people had always suffered cruel exploitation. After the opening of highways connecting Tibet with the mainland, the state-owned Tibet Trading Company transported more than 30 million catties of brick tea and tuo tea from Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places to supply the Tibetan people at reasonable prices. Now, inexpensive and high-quality domestic goods can be bought in various cities and towns in Tibet, and many local and special products and livestock products from Tibet can also be easily sold to the mainland. Some modern factory equipment, large-scale agricultural machinery, and medical equipment that Tibet had never had before have also been transported from the mainland to Tibet by road. Therefore, Tibetan compatriots excitedly call the highways "colorful ribbons floating to the sky" and "golden bridges leading to a happy paradise."
　　In 1956, the Beijing-Lhasa air route was successfully trial-flown, making transportation between Tibet and the mainland even more convenient.
　　Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet, there was no modern industry. A 60-kilowatt hydroelectric power plant and a mint with more than ten workers in Lhasa were the only two factories in all of Tibet, and that small power plant often could not generate electricity during the dry season in winter and spring. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government helped the Tibetan local government to gradually establish some industrial and mining enterprises. Power plants were built in Lhasa, Shigatse, and Qamdo successively. The newly built Lhasa power plant has more than ten times the power generation capacity of the original small power plant. The largest power station on the Tibetan Plateau—the Lhasa Hydropower Station—is under construction. After its completion, this hydropower station can generate 6,000 kilowatts. In 1958, the first coal mine in Tibet was put into production, and the ancient city of Lhasa, which had used yak dung as its main fuel for thousands of years, began to burn locally produced coal.
　　The small iron factory set up in Lhasa by the central government's Lhasa organs can manufacture production tools for agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts, as well as simple machine parts, whereas in the past, all of the Tibetan people's production tools were handmade. Last year, the personnel entering Tibet also established a local blast furnace in Lhasa, using local ore to smelt pig iron, and successfully trial-produced tractors, water pumps, electric sawing machines, steam rock drills, and so on. The central government's organs stationed in Tibet and the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet have also built a number of brick and tile wood processing and other factories in various parts of Tibet.
　　The CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army organize many agricultural loan work teams every year before the spring plowing and sowing to distribute interest-free agricultural loans to poor farmers in various places. In the past eight years, a total of more than 1.553 million yuan in interest-free agricultural loans have been distributed. In order to help Tibetan farmers change backward farming methods and solve the difficulty of lacking agricultural tools, the Central People's Government also allocated 1 million yuan to purchase a large number of agricultural and pastoral tools, which were distributed to Tibetan farmers and herdsmen free of charge. Due to the obstruction of the former Tibetan local government, many of these loans and agricultural and pastoral tools had not been distributed until before the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet. However, the Tibetan farmers and herdsmen who have suffered deeply have already felt the care of the Communist Party and the Central People's Government from the part of the loans and agricultural and pastoral tools they received. They gratefully sang: "A handful of highland barley is worth a dou of gold, when eating meat, don't forget the shepherd; dear Chairman Mao, I offer you a bunch of wheat ears."
　　Due to the cruel exploitation of the serf system and the lack of medical institutions, the Tibetan people have been under the serious threat of various diseases for many years. The former Tibetan local government watched the annual increase in the population mortality rate but never opened a formal hospital. After the People's Liberation Army and Han medical personnel entered Tibet, they established three large-scale comprehensive hospitals in Lhasa, Shigatse, and Qamdo, and established eight health centers and twelve health stations in major cities and towns in Tibet, allowing the vast majority of Tibetan people to receive free treatment. Mobile medical teams also went deep into remote agricultural and pastoral areas to provide free medical treatment to farmers and herdsmen. According to incomplete statistics from Lhasa People's Hospital alone, from 1952 to last year, the outpatient department treated more than one million Tibetan compatriots, not including outpatient and inpatient numbers. Smallpox and venereal diseases, which had long threatened the health of the Tibetan people, were widely treated, and many patients with cataracts regained their sight. Many women in difficult labor who could not be saved in the past were saved after the Han doctors' treatment, preserving the lives of both mother and child. The noble spirit of the People's Liberation Army and the personnel entering Tibet in healing the wounded and rescuing the dying for the Tibetan people has deeply moved the Tibetan people, who affectionately call the Han doctors "Menba (doctors) sent by Chairman Mao." After the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet launched a rebellion in Lhasa, the rebels once forced the masses and lamas to burn down the Lhasa People's Hospital, but they were resolutely rejected by the masses.
　　On the vast northern and southern Tibetan grasslands, for thousands of years, animal plagues have been regarded as demons of the grasslands, taking the lives of countless cattle and sheep. After liberation, the Central People's Government organized dozens of animal plague prevention and control stations in major cities and towns and pastoral areas in Tibet, and every year during the epidemic season, built hundreds of kilometers of epidemic prevention belts on the grasslands to control the spread of animal plagues. These animal plague prevention and control stations also inject tens of thousands of livestock with plague prevention vaccines every year, saving the lives of thousands upon thousands of cattle and sheep.
　　Under the rule of the feudal serf system, the vast majority of Tibetan working people had no opportunity to receive education. For many years, there was not a single formal school in all of Tibet. Now the central government's organs stationed in Tibet have established many schools throughout Tibet, including three primary schools and one middle school in Lhasa alone. When the first primary school appeared in Kongma Village, Kangba Township, a remote area in the Himalayas, Tibetan teacher Nyima Wangdui said excitedly, "When I see these children putting down their herding whips to study, I think of Chairman Mao. This is the happiness that our ancestors never had!"
　　In the past few years, the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and the personnel entering Tibet have also cultivated a large number of construction talents for the Tibetan people. Now, Tibetan cadres hold various jobs in the region's political, enterprise, cultural, educational, and medical and health departments. Some Tibetan cadres have been selected as labor models for their outstanding work, and some have taken leadership positions after practical work training.

    八年来克服重重困难　为藏胞办了不少好事
    中央帮助西藏建设成绩巨大
    新华社拉萨23日电　本社记者报道：西藏和平解放八年来，尽管原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团进行种种阻挠和破坏，中央人民政府和进藏人民解放军仍然克服各种困难，在帮助西藏人民进行经济和文化建设方面作出了许多成绩，为西藏人民办了不少好事，受到了西藏人民的衷心爱戴。
  西藏和平解放以前，西藏到内地没有公路，只有崎岖的驿道和便道。藏族人民运输完全依靠牲口或牛皮船。解放后，进藏人民解放军、汉族工人和藏族人民一起，流血流汗，征服了高山和冰川，筑起了七千多公里的公路和汽车便道。著名的康藏、青藏、新藏三条大公路，沟通了西藏和内地各兄弟民族地区的联系，根本改变了西藏长期来交通闭塞的状况。拉萨到日喀则、日喀则到江孜、江孜到亚东、黑河到阿里、邦达到宁静等几条公路干线也已经建成。过去，从西藏到内地骑马要走三个月，现在坐汽车只要七天。从西藏东部到西部相距三千多公里，过去往返一次要两年；现在从东部的三江（金沙江、怒江、澜沧江）流域到西部阿里高原的噶大克，从藏北草原到喜马拉雅山北麓的亚东，都有汽车通行，八个基巧（相当于专区）的公路线已经全部连接起来，农牧民来往十分方便。西藏和内地以及西藏内部的物资交流因交通条件的改善，也大大加强了。西藏人民生活中不可缺少的茶叶的价格，过去都操纵在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的手里，藏族人民一直受着残酷的盘剥。西藏连接内地的公路通车后，国营西藏贸易总公司就从四川、云南等地运来了三千多万斤砖茶和沱茶等，用合理价格供应藏族人民。现在，西藏各个城镇都可以买到价廉物美的国产商品，西藏的许多土、特产和畜产品也能方便地行销到内地。西藏从来没有过的一些现代化工厂设备、大型农业机械和医疗器材，也已通过公路由内地运入西藏。因此，藏胞们兴奋地把公路叫做“飘上天的彩带”和“通向幸福天堂的金桥”。
    1956年，北京—拉萨航线试航成功，西藏和内地的交通更加方便了。
    西藏和平解放前没有什么现代工业。拉萨一个发电六十瓩的水电厂和一个有十多名工人的造币厂，是全西藏仅有的两个工厂，而那个小发电厂在冬春两季枯水时还常常不能发电。西藏和平解放后，中央人民政府帮助西藏地方陆续建立了一些工矿企业。在拉萨、日喀则、昌都先后修建了发电厂，新建的拉萨发电厂比原来的小电厂发电量大十多倍。西藏高原最大的发电站——拉萨水电站正在施工，这座水电站完工后可以发电六千瓩。1958年西藏境内第一座煤矿投入生产，千百年来一直用牛粪作主要燃料的拉萨古城，开始烧到了本地出产的煤。
    中央驻拉萨机关设在拉萨的小型铁工厂，可以制造农、牧、手工业用的生产工具和简单的机器配件，而过去西藏人民的生产工具，全部是手工打造的。去年，进藏工作人员又在拉萨建立了土高炉，用本地的矿石炼出了生铁，并且试制成功了拖拉机、抽水机、电动锯木机、蒸汽开山机等。中央驻藏机关和进藏人民解放军部队还在西藏各地兴建了一批砖瓦木材加工等工厂。
    中共西藏工委和人民解放军西藏军区，每年春耕播种前都组织许多农贷工作组，把无息农贷发放给各地贫苦农民。八年来共发放无息农贷一百五十五万三千多元。为了帮助西藏农民改变落后耕作方法和解决缺乏农具的困难，中央人民政府还拨款一百万元购买了大批农牧工具，无偿发放给西藏农牧民。由于原西藏地方政府的阻挠，这些贷粮、贷款和农牧工具直到西藏上层反动集团叛乱以前，还有许多没有发放出去。但是，深受苦难的藏族农牧民同胞，从他们领到的一部分贷款贷粮和农牧工具中，已经体会到共产党和中央人民政府对他们的关怀。他们感激地歌唱道：“一把青稞一斗金，吃肉莫忘放羊人；亲人啊毛主席，割一束麦穗献给您。”
    由于农奴制度的残酷剥削和没有医疗机构，西藏人民多少年来一直处在各种疾病的严重威胁下。原西藏地方政府眼看着人口死亡率的逐年增加，却始终没有开办过一所正规医院。人民解放军和汉族医务人员入藏后，在拉萨、日喀则、昌都设立了三所规模较大的综合性医院，在西藏各大城镇设立了八个卫生院和十二个卫生所，使广大西藏人民得到了免费治疗。巡回医疗队还深入到偏僻的农牧区，为农牧民们免费医治疾病。仅据拉萨人民医院的不完全统计，从1952年到去年为止，门诊部门就为藏族同胞治病一百万人次以上，还不包括出诊和住院的人数。长期威胁着西藏人民健康的天花、性病，得到广泛的救治，不少白内瘴病人重新见到了光明。许多在过去根本没法挽救的难产的产妇，经过汉族医生的救治后保全了母子的生命。人民解放军和进藏工作人员为西藏人民救死扶伤的崇高精神，使西藏人民极为感动，他们亲热地称呼汉族医生是“毛主席派来的门巴（医生）”。西藏上层反动集团在拉萨发动叛乱后，叛匪曾经强迫群众和喇嘛去烧毁拉萨人民医院，但遭到群众坚决拒绝。
    辽阔的藏北、藏南草原上，千百年以来，兽疫被人们当作草原的魔鬼，不知夺去了多少牛羊的生命。解放后，中央人民政府在西藏各大城镇和牧区组织了几十个兽疫防治所，每年瘟疫流行的季节里，在草原上建立起数百公里长的防疫带，控制兽疫的流行。这些兽疫防治所每年还为数万头牲畜注射瘟疫预防针，救活了成千上万头牛羊。
    在封建农奴制度统治下，广大西藏劳动人民没有受教育的机会，多少年来全西藏没有一所正规学校。现在中央驻藏机关已在全藏各地设立了许多学校，仅在拉萨就设立了三所小学和一所中学。当偏僻的喜马拉雅山区康巴宗孔马村出现第一所小学时，藏族教员尼玛旺堆激动地说，“我一看见这些放下牧羊鞭子来学习的孩子，就想到毛主席。这是我们祖辈从来没有得到的幸福啊！”
    进藏人民解放军和进藏工作人员，几年来还为西藏人民培养了大批建设人才。现在，西藏全区的政权、企业、文教和医疗卫生部门里，都有藏族干部担任各种工作。有些藏族干部因工作出色被选为劳动模范，有些经过实际工作的锻炼已担任领导工作。
