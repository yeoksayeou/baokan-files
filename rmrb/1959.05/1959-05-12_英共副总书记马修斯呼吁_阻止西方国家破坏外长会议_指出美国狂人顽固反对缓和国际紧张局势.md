Xinhua News Agency, London, May 10th: On the eve of the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference opening in Geneva on the 11th, the Communist Party of Great Britain called on the British people to intensify united action to strive for peace.

    George Matthews, Deputy General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain and Deputy Editor of the "Daily Worker," said at a meeting of the Party's Executive Committee last weekend that if the British people declare that they will not allow the Foreign Ministers' Conference to fail and insist on holding a summit meeting, then the sabotage of the conference by the United States, West Germany, and France may be thwarted.

    He went on to say that there are two attitudes towards the Geneva conference. The Soviet Union and ordinary people all over the world hope that it will be a conference to prepare for a summit meeting.

    The madmen of the West, especially the United States, represent another attitude, they stubbornly oppose any easing of East-West tensions.

    He pointed out that American generals are using high-altitude flights through the airspace of the German Democratic Republic to West Berlin and talking about waging war over the Berlin issue to carry out provocations. U.S. Secretary of State Herter once said that progress at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is a condition for holding a summit meeting.

    Matthews said: British policy has undergone some changes, but Mr. Macmillan is still an imperialist. The differences between the British Conservative Party and Britain's Western allies occur on how to save imperialism and stop the advance of socialism and national liberation movements.

    He pointed out that because general elections will be held next year, Macmillan has to consider public opinion. His emphasis on peace, starting from deceiving voters, is good for the peace movement and the work of the Communist Party.

    He went on to say that many leaders of the British government also believe that during Dulles' tenure, U.S. policy was too clumsy and rigid, and "benefited the communists."

    Matthews said that if Mr. Macmillan believes that a more "flexible" policy will defeat communism, as long as this idea can promote the easing of the international situation, the Communists are willing to let him maintain this illusion.

    Matthews emphasized that Macmillan may have tactical differences with the United States, but as long as the United States wields a big stick, he often succumbs. For example, when he was in Moscow, he signed a communique suggesting limiting armed forces in Europe. However, in the recent debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said that Macmillan's plan might actually lead to an increase in weapons in some parts of Europe.

    According to newspaper reports, Macmillan agreed with the U.S. proposal to put forward a "package plan" at the Geneva conference during the recent meeting of NATO member states. This plan means that every proposal, no matter how small, must be subordinate to accepting the U.S. attitude towards the German and European issues, which will sabotage the meeting.

    Matthews pointed out that the April 6th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" made everyone aware of what was related to the struggle for peace, and this report has never been denied. The report said that Macmillan told U.S. President Eisenhower in Washington: "If there really is going to be a war, then decide now, so I can send the British children to Canada to save our families. My experts tell me that a nuclear war will mean that 20 million people will die in Britain."

    Matthews said: Please note: he (Macmillan) is not putting the responsibility for the war on the Soviet Union, but on the United States, and he confirmed the Conservative Party's plan to evacuate themselves and their children to Canada, while letting ordinary people "suffer."

    In particular, he talked about 20 million deaths. This is the disaster we will suffer unless international talks finally reach an agreement and disarmament is eventually implemented.

    Matthews said that this idea should inspire the British people to work harder for peace.

    Matthews called for launching a united movement to stop the West from undermining the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and he asked the Labour Party's National Executive Committee to launch a national movement for this purpose.

    Matthews called on Communists to fully support the demonstration organized by the British Peace Committee on June 28th, and to cooperate with everyone, no matter what differences the Communist Party may have with them on other issues, in order to make this demonstration a great victory.

    英共副总书记马修斯呼吁
    阻止西方国家破坏外长会议
    指出美国狂人顽固反对缓和国际紧张局势
    据新华社伦敦10日电　在东西方外长会议11日在日内瓦开幕的前夕，英国共产党呼吁英国人民为争取和平而加紧采取团结一致的行动。
    英国共产党副总书记兼“工人日报”副总编辑乔治·马修斯在党的执行委员会上周末举行的一次会议上说，如果英国人民声明他们不容许外长会议失败并且坚持举行一次最高级会议的话，那么，美国、西德和法国对会议的破坏就可能被挫败。
    他接着说，有两种对待日内瓦会议的态度。苏联和全世界普通的人民希望它是一次为最高级会议进行准备的会议。
    西方的、特别是美国的疯狂的人们代表了另外一种态度，他们顽固地反对使东西方紧张局势得到任何缓和。
    他指出，美国将军们正在利用通过德意志民主共和国领空到西柏林的高空飞行和谈论为柏林问题而进行战争来进行挑衅。美国国务卿赫脱曾经谈到外长会议取得进展是举行最高级会议的一个条件。
    马修斯说：英国的政策曾经有一些改变，但是，麦克米伦先生仍然是一个帝国主义者。英国保守党同英国的西方盟国之间的意见分歧发生在如何挽救帝国主义和制止社会主义和民族解放运动前进的方式问题上。
    他指出，由于明年将举行大选，麦克米伦不得不考虑公众的意见。他从骗取选票出发而对和平所表示的重视，是对和平运动和共产党的工作是有好处的。
    他接着说，英国政府的许多领袖还认为，杜勒斯在任时期，美国的政策过于笨拙、僵硬，而“有利于共产党人”。
    马修斯说，如果麦克米伦先生认为，比较“灵活”的政策将打败共产主义，只要这种想法能促进国际局势的缓和，共产党人愿意让他保持着这种幻想。
    马修斯强调，麦克米伦在策略上可能同美国有分歧，但是，只要美国一挥动大棒，他常常就屈服了。例如，当他在莫斯科的时候，他曾签署了一项公报，建议在欧洲限制武装部队。但是，在下院最近一次辩论外交问题时，英国外交大臣劳埃德说，麦克米伦的计划实际上可能导向欧洲某些地区的武器的增加。
    据报纸报道，麦克米伦在最近举行的北大西洋公约组织成员国会谈时已经同意了美国关于在日内瓦会议上提出“一揽子计划”的建议。这个计划意味着，每一个建议，不管多么小，都要从属于接受美国对德国和欧洲问题的态度，这将使会议遭到破坏。
    马修斯指出，4月6日的“美国新闻与世界报道”使大家都知道了同争取和平的斗争有关的是什么问题，而且这则报道从来没有被否认过。这则报道说，麦克米伦在华盛顿时对美国总统艾森豪威尔说：“如果真要打仗的话，那么，现在就决定吧，这样我好把英国的孩子们送到加拿大去以便保存我们的家庭。我的专家们告诉我，核战争将意味着在英国要死亡两千万人。”
    马修斯说：请注意：他（麦克米伦）不是把战争的责任放在苏联身上，而是放在美国身上，而且他证实了保守党的计划是要把他们自己和他们的孩子们撤往加拿大，而让普通人民去“遭殃”。
    尤其是他谈到将有两千万人死亡。这就是除非国际会谈最后达成协议和终将实行裁军，我们将遭受到的灾难。
    马修斯说，这个思想应当鼓舞英国人民更加努力为和平而斗争。
    马修斯呼吁展开一个联合的运动来制止西方破坏外长会议的活动，他要求工党的全国执行委员会为此而开展一个全国性的运动。
    马修斯要求共产党人全力支持英国和平委员会组织的6月28日的示威，并且同每一个人合作。不论共产党在其它问题上可能同他们有什么分歧，以便使这次示威取得巨大的胜利。
