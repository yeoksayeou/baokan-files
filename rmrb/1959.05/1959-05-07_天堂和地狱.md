　　Heaven and Hell
　　Tibetan　Oumei Jia Can
　　More than twenty years ago, after my family's house and land were seized by the "Deba Xiong" (Note 1) and the Kuomintang reactionaries, our family began living the wandering life of "Reba" people (Note 2). Year after year, we were chronically underfed and poorly clothed, living in other people's cattle and sheep pens. Whether it was winter or summer, sunny or rainy, we wore the same tattered clothes. We stayed wherever we could find a meal; having eaten today, we didn't know if we would be full or hungry tomorrow, let alone have a good meal of buttered tsampa and milk tea.
　　In the past, "Reba" people were the most despised. We endured all kinds of hardships, torment, and humiliation, wandering, performing, and begging everywhere... I lived this way in the old society for a long seventeen or eighteen years.
　　"Reba" people were so ruthlessly tormented, with no place to appeal. We could only sing with tears:
　　"I am willing to pour out my pain,
　　But people look down on the 'Reba' people.
　　And I,
　　Do not want to tell my pain to those without conscience."
　　Despite this, we still yearned for a better life, and we sang:
　　"Don't be so sad,
　　My mood is the same as yours;
　　It's no use being so miserable,
　　After the pain, the sun of happiness will rise."
　　After liberation, a new life began. In 1953, I joined the Central National Song and Dance Troupe as a Tibetan folk artist. I lived closely with actors from all ethnic groups, and with the Party's utmost care and the sincere help of the Han elder brothers, I grew up. I felt that I was already the master of the society and the country, and I no longer had to worry about life and my children's illnesses. I could devote myself to the socialist construction of the motherland and become a glorious ethnic minority literary and art worker.
　　In recent years, I have traveled to many parts of the motherland, and I have seen the vastness and richness of the motherland's land, and the vigorous rise of various construction undertakings; I have seen that under the glorious light of the Party's ethnic policies, various minority ethnic groups have successively established autonomous regions, and are developing their own political, economic, and cultural affairs by leaps and bounds. I have learned a lot, and I love my motherland even more.
　　In 1957, I participated in the 6th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Moscow, and the Tibetan folk dance "Reba on the Grassland," which I choreographed, won the third prize. What I will never forget is that the Party patiently cultivated me politically, enabling me to have a preliminary communist consciousness. At the end of 1956, I was accepted as a glorious Communist Party member. In the same year, I was also named as a representative to attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers and Workers. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, thanks to the Party's teachings and my own efforts, I was again named an advanced worker in our troupe.
　　How could I have imagined all this in the past? How could I have dreamed of it? Only the Party and Chairman Mao have enabled us Tibetan people to get rid of our suffering and obtain true happiness. The kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao is like the clear water of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, which can never be fully expressed. I can only sing and dance to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao.
　　Looking back on my life of more than thirty years, it can truly be said that I am now in heaven, while in the past I was in hell.
　　Note: (1) "Deba Xiong" is a term for the Tibetan reactionary group.
　　　　(2) "Reba" people are Tibetan wandering artists, who were regarded as the lowest class of people in the past.

　　天堂和地狱
　　藏族　欧米加参
    二十多年前，我家的房子和地被“德巴雄”（注一）和国民党反动派抢走以后，我们一家人就开始过着“热巴”（注二）人的流浪生活。常年累月的吃不饱穿不暖，住的是人家的牛圈羊圈；不管是冬天还是夏天，是晴天还是雨天，都穿着一套破烂的衣服。那里能吃一顿就在那里住下；今天吃了却不知明天是饱还是饥，更说不上吃上一顿好的酥油?粑和奶子茶了。
    “热巴”人在过去是最被人看不起的。我们忍受着千辛万苦、摧残和屈辱，到处流浪、卖艺、乞讨……。我就这样的在旧社会生活了漫长的十七、八年。
    “热巴”人就是这样无情的受着摧残，无处申诉。我们只有含泪地唱着：
    “我很愿意把自己的痛苦倾吐，
    但人家瞧不起‘热巴’人。
　　而我，
    却不愿把自己的痛苦告诉那些没有良心的人。”
    尽管如此，我们还是向往着美好的生活，我们又唱着：
    “不要这样难过，
    我的心情和你一样；
    这样痛苦下去没有用，
    在痛苦的后面会升起幸福的太阳。”
    解放后，新的生活开始了。1953年，我作为藏族民间艺人参加了中央民族歌舞团。我和各民族演员亲密的生活在一起，在党的百般关怀和汉族老大哥的真诚帮助下，我成长起来了。我感到自己已经是社会和国家的主人，再也不必为生活和孩子们的病痛而忧愁。我可以安心地为祖国的社会主义建设献出自己的力量，成为一个光荣的民族文艺工作者。
    几年来，我走过了祖国的许多地方，看到了祖国的辽阔和富丽的土地，和各种建设事业的蓬勃兴起；看到了各少数民族在党的民族政策光辉照耀下，先后都成立了自治区，并且一日千里的在发展本民族的政治、经济、文化。我学习到很多东西，我也更加热爱我的祖国了。
    1957年我参加了莫斯科的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，由我编导的藏族民间舞蹈“草原上的热巴”获得了三等奖。使我终身难忘的是党在政治上耐心地培养我，使我初步具备了共产主义觉悟，1956年底我被接受为光荣的共产党员。同年，我又被评为出席全国先进生产工作者代表大会的代表。在1958年的大跃进中，由于党的教导和自己的努力，我又被评为我们团的先进工作者。
    这一切我过去那能想到呢？那能梦到呢？只有党和毛主席才使得我们藏族人民脱离了苦难的日子，得到真正的幸福。党和毛主席的恩情，像雅鲁藏布江清亮的河水一样，永远也说不完，我只有纵情地歌，尽情地舞来表达我对党和毛主席的衷心感激。
    回顾我三十多年来的生活，真是可以说现在是在天堂里，而过去是在地狱里。
    注：（一）“德巴雄”是对西藏反动集团的称呼。
        （二）“热巴”人是藏族的流浪艺人，过去被人看为是最下等的人。
