Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 21st: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter Robertson recently testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, boasting about the "achievements" of the United States in its long-term instigation and incitement of the Lao Kingdom authorities to tear up the Geneva Agreements on Laos, thereby seriously threatening peace in Indochina.

In his redacted testimony released on the 19th, Robertson said that the U.S. "aid" program in Laos has been one of the most successful programs in the world. He called this program "a program to be proud of." He said: "Now let's look at the situation today. They (referring to the Lao Kingdom authorities) have expelled two Communists from the government. ... They have a government that is strongly oriented towards the free world, a government that has rejected aid from the Communist bloc and does not exchange diplomatic representatives with them."

    承认策动老挝政府撕毁协议
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊最近在众议院外交委员会作证时，吹嘘美国长期策动和教唆老挝王国当局撕毁关于老挝的日内瓦协议从而严重威胁印度支那和平的“成就”。
    罗伯逊在19日发表的经过删节的证词中说，美国在老挝的“援助”计划一直是世界上最成功的计划之一。他把这个计划称为“可以引为骄傲的一个计划”。他说：“现在让我们看一看今天的情况吧。他们（指老挝王国当局）驱除了两名在政府中的共产党人。……他们有一个强烈地倾向于自由世界的政府，这个政府拒绝了共产党集团的援助，而且不同他们互派外交代表。”
