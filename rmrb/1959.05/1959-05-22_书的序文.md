　　People who read books generally like to read the preface, foreword, or publishing notes first. A good preface is of great help to the reader. Not to mention Marx's preface to "Das Kapital," preface to "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy," Chairman Mao's preface to "Rural Surveys," and preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," which give us great education and encouragement; even a good preface in an ancient book or a modern person's works can give us some enlightenment and some hints. For example, if we want to study Sima Qian and his "Records of the Grand Historian," we must read "The Autobiography of the Grand Historian"; reading Comrade Guo Moruo's "Reissue Foreword" to the book "A Collection of Studies on Bronze Inscriptions" will make us realize that the purpose of Guo Lao in writing this book was to challenge Hu Shi and his ilk, who flaunted "sorting out the national heritage," and to expose the true colors of those comprador class so-called "scholars," and so on.
    Speaking of writing prefaces for books, we must cite Lu Xun's glorious example. In Lu Xun's works, translations, and edited books, there is hardly one without a preface, foreword, or similar text. These prefaces are profound in their arguments, incisive in their analyses, and sharp and beautiful in their writing, all of which are examples worthy of our eternal study. Sometimes when we read a translated work or a reprinted ancient book, there is no explanation of the author's life or the origin and development of the book, which causes unnecessary confusion for the reader. Of course, this situation has decreased in the past year, but it is still a problem worthy of attention. I think we should also write a necessary preface or explanatory text in front of the book as much as possible when publishing books today. Moreover, the preface of a book should become a place for "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Different schools, different styles, and different views may as well bloom and contend in the preface of the book. This may not be beneficial to the prosperity of academic culture!

    书的序文
　　萧丕安
    人们读书，总喜欢先读一遍这书的序言、题记或出版说明。一篇好的序言，对读者的帮助实在很大。且不说马克思的“资本论”序言、“政治经济学批判”序言、毛主席的“农村调查”的序言及“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言，它们给我们以巨大教育和鼓舞；就是一部古书或现代人的一些著作中的好的序言，也能对我们有所启发、有所提示。比如，我们要研究司马迁和他的“史记”，就非得看看“太史公自序”不可；读郭沫若同志为“金文丛考”一书所写的“重印弁言”，会使我们知道，原来郭老写这部书的目的是要向标榜“整理国故”的胡适之流挑战，揭穿那些买办阶级的所谓“学者”的假古董的本相，如此等等。
    说到为书籍写序言，不能不举出鲁迅的光辉榜样。在鲁迅的著作、翻译和编辑的书籍中，几乎没有一本是没有序言、题记之类的文字的。这些序言议论的深刻、分析的精辟、文字的锋利优美，都是值得我们永远学习的范例。我们有时读到一本翻译作品或重印的古籍，往往书前对作者的生平、书籍的源流情况不加任何交代，而使读者发生不应有的困惑。当然，近一年来，这种情形是少了，但这仍然是一个值得重视的问题。我想我们今天出版书籍，也应尽可能在书前写一篇必要的序言或说明文字。而且书籍的序言，应该成为“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的一个场所，不同的学派、不同的风格、不同的看法，不妨在书籍的序言中齐放争鸣。这对繁荣学术文化或者未尝不是有好处的吧！
