Implement the policy of suburbs serving cities and being self-sufficient in production
Seven Major Cities Vigorously Promote Vegetable Production

Beijing

This newspaper reports that after successfully completing the spring vegetable production tasks, farmers in the suburbs of the capital are continuing to exert their efforts, focusing on the three key aspects of vegetable planting, management, and harvesting, and taking various measures to strive for an even greater summer vegetable harvest.

In the first four months of this year, the production of commercial vegetables in the suburbs of the capital increased by 41% compared with the same period last year. The amount available on the market since May has also increased compared with the same period last year. However, due to the increased demand, vegetables are still in short supply. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a broadcast conference, calling on farmers in the suburbs to launch a vigorous summer production campaign to strive for a bumper harvest of both grain and vegetables. In terms of vegetable production, people's communes that mainly grow vegetables are required to coordinate labor and transportation, quickly fertilize and water the growing vegetables, prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests to promote early maturity, and at the same time, seize the harvesting and marketing of vegetables to ensure a rapid increase in supply.

Currently, spring-sown potatoes have formed tubers, kidney beans are flowering and podding, and most vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, and green peppers have been transplanted. According to the growth of various vegetables, the relevant people's communes are now stepping up a series of field management tasks such as soil cultivation, weeding, topdressing, watering, and building trellises.

Shanghai

This newspaper reports from Shanghai on May 29th that the vegetable supply in Shanghai, a city with a population of seven million, has now achieved self-sufficiency. From January to early May this year, the average daily supply of vegetables from the city's suburbs to urban residents reached 11.3 ounces per person. Since mid-May, with the large-scale marketing of winter-sown vegetables and the start of new summer vegetables, the supply has become even more abundant, with the average daily vegetable supply per citizen rising to about 1.5 pounds.

Shanghai has historically been unable to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables. Since September and October of last year, under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and after several months of efforts by relevant departments and farmers in the suburbs, a new situation has emerged in Shanghai's vegetable supply. In improving the supply, the Municipal Party Secretary personally took charge of vegetable production in the suburbs, and the Municipal Party Committee's Rural Work Department established a special organization to manage vegetable production. The Party Secretaries of suburban counties and communes also took the lead, organizing professional vegetable production teams. Through unified arrangements, the fixed planting area for supplying vegetables to the city was expanded from the original 230,000 mu to 350,000 mu this year. Subsequently, the eleven suburban counties were divided into four cooperation zones, with the old vegetable-growing areas contracting the new vegetable-growing areas, and organizing exchanges and mutual support of seeds between communes and between production teams, which promptly solved the problem of seed shortage.

Currently, relevant departments in Shanghai require all communes to not only continue to meet the needs of citizens in terms of quantity but also pay attention to improving the quality of vegetables. Twelve communes that produce a large quantity of vegetables have established new variety testing farms. Professional teams planting vegetables are concentrating their efforts on strengthening vegetable field management to strive for high-quality and high-yield summer vegetables.

Guangzhou

This newspaper reports from Guangzhou on May 29th that Guangzhou's vegetable production has basically achieved self-sufficiency. At present, the daily supply of vegetables from the suburbs exceeds two million catties, averaging more than one catty per citizen.

In order to fundamentally solve the vegetable supply problem in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China began in February this year to determine that the near suburbs would focus on vegetable production, implementing the policy of "local production, local supply, and guaranteed self-sufficiency." On the one hand, the vegetable planting area was expanded, and on the other hand, a comprehensive plan was made for the types of production, quantity, and time to market according to market needs, and specific assistance was given to various people's communes in the suburbs to solve problems in seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and production technology. Therefore, in just a few months, the vegetable planting area has increased from 60,000 mu last year to nearly 210,000 mu now. The amount of vegetables on the market has also increased from an average of 840,000 catties per day in January this year to an average of more than 2 million catties per day now.

In order to change the past situation of "too much to eat in the peak season and not enough to eat in the off-season," Guangzhou is now, in addition to commercial departments appropriately processing some melons and vegetables for off-season market adjustments, people's communes in the suburbs are actively arranging vegetable production for the off-season in July and August.

Wuhan

This newspaper reports from Wuhan on May 29th that the people's communes in the suburbs of Wuhan and the Dongxihu State Farm are actively developing vegetable production under the guidance of the policy of serving the city and serving production and construction. Up to now, the vegetable sowing area has reached more than 94,000 mu, more than double that of the same period last year.

Vegetable production in the suburbs of Wuhan gradually began to form a climax between February and March this year. After discussions, the commune members of various people's communes clarified the production policy of the suburbs focusing on the development of non-staple food production and supporting the city, and their enthusiasm for production soared. The Party Secretaries of the communes, management districts, and production teams all took the lead, specializing in leading the production of non-staple foods such as vegetables and meat.

In the rapid development of vegetable production, the communes and farms paid attention to solving the specific problems of fertilizers, seeds, water conservancy and drainage, transportation tools, and technical training in a timely manner.

Xi'an

This newspaper reports from Xi'an on May 29th that farmers in the suburbs of Xi'an plan to plant more than 644,000 mu of vegetables this year, more than double that of last year. As of now, more than 160,000 mu of spring and summer vegetables have been sown in the city's suburbs and city-affiliated counties. After these vegetables are successively put on the market, the tense situation of vegetable supply in the market has been alleviated.

In order to do a good job in vegetable production, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have held two or three meetings since February this year to study and arrange the vegetable production plan. Vice Mayor Yang Xiaochu personally supervised and inspected, and went deep into the suburbs to help farmers solve problems in vegetable production. In addition, a vegetable seed collection base of more than 6,000 mu has been established to ensure the self-supply of autumn vegetable seeds. In terms of labor, the counties and districts have properly arranged labor according to the local vegetable planting area. In key areas, more than 120 vegetable production professional teams have been organized to fix specialized personnel to grow vegetables all year round.

Taiyuan

This newspaper reports from Taiyuan on May 29th that after Taiyuan City implemented the central government's policy of "local production, local supply, contracted by regions, and guaranteed self-sufficiency" to solve the city's vegetable problem, the date of urban vegetable marketing was more than half a month earlier than in previous years. Since late March, spinach, radishes, cabbage, rapeseed, leeks, etc. have been supplied in a timely manner. At present, the sowing of spring and summer vegetables in the suburbs of the city has basically ended; the autumn and winter vegetable production plan has also been arranged and specifically implemented to the production teams. According to statistics, the planting area of spring, summer, autumn, and winter vegetables in Taiyuan this year is more than 182,000 mu, which is more than three times larger than last year.

The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized and studied the experiences and lessons of vegetable production and sales over the years, and determined to make vegetable production in this year achieve a balance between supply and demand. When the agricultural leading departments in Taiyuan City specifically implemented the central government's policy and the Municipal Party Committee's resolutions, they also implemented the method of local production and adapting to local conditions, and after discussions from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the vegetable planting plan was implemented to the grassroots production teams of the commune. At the same time, it also helped the communes solve a series of difficult problems.

Harbin

This newspaper reports from Harbin on May 29th that various vegetable production bases in Harbin City are supplying the market with large quantities of fresh vegetables. This spring, thirteen people's communes in the near suburbs of Harbin planted more than 56,000 mu of spring vegetables, which have been harvested in abundance. In addition, some vegetables from the city's more than 36,000 square meters of greenhouse vegetable production are also supplied to the market every day. Six vegetable bases in the far suburbs, such as Hulan, Zhaodong, and Acheng, have also planted many spring vegetables.

This year, the city plans to plant 750,000 mu of summer and autumn vegetables and has made proper arrangements, and the production plan has been fully implemented. Farmers in the counties in the suburbs of the city have also planted vegetables on 200,000 mu of private plots. This year, there has also been an increase in the variety of vegetables, including Chinese cabbage, cabbage, carrots, and carrots suitable for year-round storage, as well as lettuce, loofah, and solid celery, which are new varieties introduced from the south.

    贯彻郊区为城市服务和生产自给的方针
    七大城市大抓蔬菜生产
    北京
    本报讯　首都郊区农民在胜利完成了春季蔬菜生产任务之后，继续鼓足干劲，抓紧蔬菜的栽种、管理、收获三大环节，采取各种措施，争取夏季蔬菜更大丰收。
    今年头四个月，首都郊区生产的商品蔬菜比去年同期增加了41％，5月以来的上市量比去年同期也有增加，但是由于需要量的增加，目前蔬菜仍感不足。中共北京市委最近召开了一次广播大会，号召郊区农民开展轰轰烈烈的夏季生产运动，争取粮菜双丰收。在蔬菜生产方面，要求以种菜为主的人民公社，统一安排人力和运输力，给正在生长的蔬菜赶快加肥加水，防治病虫害，促使早熟，同时抓紧蔬菜的收获和上市工作，保证供应量迅速增加。
    目前，春播的土豆已结薯块，芸豆正在开花结荚，西红柿、茄子、青椒等蔬菜大部分定植完毕。各有关人民公社根据各类蔬菜生长情况，现正加紧进行中耕、除草、追肥、浇水、搭架等一系列田间管理工作。
    上海
    本报上海29日电　拥有七百万人口的上海市的蔬菜供应，目前已做到自给。今年1月到5月上旬，市郊农村每天供应城市居民的蔬菜，每人平均达到十一点三两；5月中旬以后，随着冬播菜的大量上市和夏令菜的开始尝新，供应更加充沛，平均每个市民每天的蔬菜供应量上升到一斤半左右。
    上海蔬菜历来不能自给。从去年9、10月以来在中共上海市委直接领导下，经过有关部门和市郊农民几个月的努力，上海蔬菜的供应便出现了新的局面。在改善供应的工作中，市委书记亲自抓市郊的蔬菜生产，市委农村工作部成立了管理蔬菜生产的专门机构，市郊各县和公社党委也由书记挂帅，组织了蔬菜生产的专业队伍。经过统一安排，供应城市蔬菜的固定种植面积由原来二十三万亩扩大到今年的三十五万亩。随后又将郊区十一个县划为四个协作片，由老菜区包干新菜区，并组织公社与公社、生产队与生产队间交换和互相支援种籽，及时解决了种籽不足的问题。
    目前，上海市有关部门要求各公社除继续在数量上满足市民的需要外，注意提高蔬菜质量。盛产蔬菜的十二个公社分别建立了新品种试验场；种植蔬菜的专业队伍正在集中力量加强菜田管理，争取夏令菜优质、丰收。
    广州
    本报广州29日电　广州市蔬菜生产已基本达到自给自足。目前，由郊区供应的蔬菜每天都在二百万斤以上，平均每一市民一斤多。
    为了从根本上解决广州市的蔬菜供应问题，中共广州市委从今年2月开始，确定近郊区以生产蔬菜为主，贯彻“就地生产、就地供应、保证自给”的方针。一方面扩大蔬菜种植面积，一方面根据市场需要，对生产品种、数量、上市时间等进行了全面规划，并具体帮助郊区各人民公社解决种子、肥料、农药和生产技术等方面的问题，因此在短短的几个月中，蔬菜种植面积便从去年的六万亩增加到现在的近二十一万亩；蔬菜的上市量，也由今年1月份的平均每天八十四万斤增加到现在的每天平均二百多万斤。
    为了改变过去那种“旺季吃不了，淡季不够吃”的情况，广州市现在除由商业部门适当加工一部分瓜菜留作淡季调剂市场需要外，郊区各人民公社正在积极安排7、8月份淡季的蔬菜生产。
    武汉
    本报武汉29日电　武汉市郊区各人民公社和东西湖国营农场，在为城市服务、为生产建设服务的方针指导下，积极发展蔬菜生产。到目前止，蔬菜播种面积已达九万四千多亩，比去年同期增加一倍多。
    武汉市郊区的蔬菜生产在今年2、3月间开始逐步形成高潮。各人民公社社员们经过讨论，明确了郊区以发展副食品生产、支援城市为主的生产方针后，生产热情高涨。各公社、管理区和生产队都由党委书记挂帅，专门领导蔬菜、肉类等副食品生产。
    在迅速发展蔬菜生产中，各公社、农场都注意了及时解决肥料、种籽、水利排灌、运输工具和技术培训等具体问题。
    西安
    本报西安29日电　西安市郊区农民今年计划种蔬菜六十四万四千多亩，比去年增加两倍以上。截至目前为止，市郊区和市属县已播种春夏菜十六万多亩，这些蔬菜陆续上市以后，缓和了市场上的蔬菜供应紧张局势。
    为了搞好蔬菜生产，中共西安市委和市人民委员会从今年2月以来，连续召开了两、三次会议，研究安排了蔬菜生产计划。杨晓初副市长亲自督促检查，并深入郊区帮助农民解决蔬菜生产中的问题。此外，还建立了六千多亩蔬菜采种基地，保证秋菜种籽的自供自给。在劳力方面，各县、区都根据当地蔬菜种植面积妥善安排劳力，在重点地区还组织了一百二十多个蔬菜生产专业队，固定专人常年种菜。
    太原
    本报太原29日电　太原市执行中央“就地生产，就地供应，划片包干，保证自给”解决城市蔬菜的方针后，城市蔬菜上市日期比往年提早了半个多月。从3月下旬以来，菠菜、水萝卜、小白菜、油菜、韭菜等作到了及时供应。现在，全市郊区春夏蔬菜播种已基本结束；秋冬蔬菜生产计划也已作了安排，具体落实到生产队。据统计，今年太原市春夏秋冬四季蔬菜种植面积为十八万二千多亩，比去年扩大了三倍多。
    中共太原市委总结研究了历年来蔬菜产销方面的经验教训，下定决心要使蔬菜生产在今年做到供求平衡。太原市农业领导部门在具体贯彻中央方针和市委决议时，又实行了就地出产、因地制宜的办法，并经过由上而下、由下而上的讨论，把蔬菜种植计划落实到公社基层生产队。同时，还帮助各公社解决了一系列的困难问题。哈尔滨
    本报哈尔滨29日电　哈尔滨市各蔬菜生产基地正以大量的鲜菜供应市场。今春，哈尔滨市近郊十三个人民公社种植了五万六千多亩春菜，得到丰收，另外，全市的三万六千多平方公尺温室蔬菜生产，每天也有一些蔬菜供应市场。远郊的呼兰、肇东、阿城等六个蔬菜基地也种了许多春菜。
    今年全市计划种夏菜和秋菜七十五万亩，并且作了妥善安排，生产计划全部落实。市郊各县农民还在二十万亩自留地上种了蔬菜。今年菜的品种也有增加，其中有适合常年保管的大白菜、洋白菜、大萝卜、胡萝卜等，也有莴苣、丝瓜、实心芹菜等新从南方引来的菜种。（附图片）
