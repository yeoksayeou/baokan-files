    Increase Work Efficiency, Save Labor, Ensure Timely Summer Planting and Harvesting:
    Jingguan Commune Establishes Field Transportation Tracks
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 26th) The Jingguan People's Commune in Jiangbei County, Sichuan, is accelerating the laying of tracks and the construction of carts while rushing to repair and manufacture tools for summer harvesting and planting. They are vigorously developing field transportation tools, focusing on solving the problem of field transportation, which consumes a lot of labor and is labor-intensive. At present, the commune has built more than 140 kilometers of wooden tracks and more than 2,000 various carts, connecting the fields with all the drying yards, warehouses, canteens, and breeding farms. It is estimated that the labor days spent on transportation during the summer harvest and planting season will be reduced from more than 50% of the total labor days to about 20%. The two items of grain and fertilizer transportation alone can save more than 60,000 labor days compared to manual carrying.
    Recently, this reporter came to the Jingguan Commune and saw that in the undulating fields, transportation tracks extended in all directions. Wooden tracks meandered along the field ridges and paths, crisscrossing and connecting with each other. Various types of wooden-wheeled wooden-bucket carts were running on the tracks, some carrying fertilizer to the fields, and some loaded with wheat grains just harvested from the fields. Staff members of the Jingguan Commune Party Committee told me that using wooden rail cars for transportation, each person can push an average of more than 200 kilograms each time, which increases work efficiency by more than three times compared to manual carrying, and greatly reduces labor intensity. In the month or so before the start of the wheat harvest, the commune used wooden rails and wooden buckets to transport more than 300 million catties of fertilizer, and saved more than 97,000 earth-moving man-days in the construction of water conservancy projects.
    The Jingguan Commune is surrounded by mountains on the west and north sides, and the terrain is undulating, making transportation extremely inconvenient. Due to the difficulty of transportation, last year tens of thousands of catties of granular fertilizer could not be transported to the fields, causing the wheat seedlings to turn yellow and affecting the yield. This year, the commune's industrial and agricultural production has made greater progress than last year, with an unprecedented wheat harvest, and the area planted with intermediate rice is also larger than last year. According to statistics, the transportation volume of agricultural products, fertilizers and other materials in the commune will increase by about two times compared to last year, and the labor force feels even more strained. How to solve this contradiction? According to the commune's terrain characteristics and current production needs, the Jingguan Commune Party Committee believes that it is necessary to vigorously develop transportation construction and change the field transportation method. After research, they put forward the proposal to establish wooden rail transportation, and used accounting and comparison methods to mobilize the masses to discuss how much labor is needed for current production, and how many people are needed to transport the total industrial and agricultural products this year, so that all commune members understand the importance of realizing the commune's transportation track system. Then, in combination with the cleaning of the commune's warehouse, some scrap iron and a large amount of wood were found. In this way, a mass movement of track laying and cart building was rapidly launched throughout the commune.
    The tracks laid by the Jingguan Commune have the characteristics of large transportation volume, simple construction, easy to obtain materials, and fast construction. Its roadbed is narrow, generally only one meter wide, occupies less land, is not restricted by terrain, and can be built in both mountainous and plain areas. Moreover, it costs very little, with an actual cost of only 43 yuan per kilometer. Wooden rail cars save labor and effort. According to measurements, the starting pulling force per hundred kilograms is only 4.03 kilograms. Therefore, the masses of the whole commune are all jubilant.

    提高工效  节省劳力  保证及时夏种夏收
    静观公社建立田间运输轨道
    本报成都26日电  四川江北县静观人民公社在突击检修赶制夏收夏种工具中，加速铺轨造车，大办田间运输工具，重点解决占用劳力较多、费工量较大的田间运输问题。目前全社已修建木轨道一百四十多公里，各种车子二千多辆，接连了田间和所有的晒场、仓库、食堂、饲养场，使夏收夏种期间预计参加运输的劳动日，由原来占全部劳动日的50％以上降低为20％左右，仅运粮运肥两项即可比原来用人力肩挑节约六万多个劳动日。
    最近，记者来到静观公社，只见在起伏无垠的田地里，运输轨道四通八达，沿着田埂、小路、蜿蜒地盘旋着一条条的木轨道，纵横交错，互相衔接，轨道上奔驰着各式各样的人推木轮木斗车，有的正往田头送肥，有的装满了刚刚在田间打下的麦粒。中共静观公社党委会工作人员告诉我，用木轨车运输，每人每次平均推二百公斤以上，比人力肩挑提高工效三倍多，而且大大减轻了劳动强度。在麦收开始前的一个多月里，全社利用木轨木斗已经运输了三亿多斤肥料，在修建水库工程中节约了九万七千多个运土工。
    静观公社西、北两面环山，境内丘陵起伏，交通极为不便。由于运输艰难，去年曾因劳动力调配不及，数万斤颗粒肥料运不下地，使麦苗一度发黄，影响了产量。今年全社工农业生产比去年有更大进展，小麦空前丰收，中稻栽插面积也比去年扩大。据统计，全社农产品、肥料和其它物资的运输量将比去年增加二倍左右，劳动力感到更加紧张。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？中共静观公社党委根据本社地形特点和当前生产需要，认为必须大搞交通建设，改变田间运输方式。他们研究后便提出了建立木轨运输的建议，运用算账对比的方法，发动群众讨论当前生产到底需要多少劳动力，今年工农业产品总共需要多少人运输等问题，使全体社员都了解到实现全社运输轨道化的重要意义。接着，结合清理公社仓库，找出了一些废铁和大批木料。这样，一个群众性的铺轨造车运动就在全社迅速地开展起来了。
    静观公社铺设的轨道具有运输量大、工程简单、取材容易、建成快的特点，它的路基窄，宽度一般只有一公尺，占用土地少，不受地形限制，山区平原都能修。而且花钱很少，实际每公里造价只有四十三元。木轨车省人省力，根据测定每百公斤的起步拉力只有四点零三公斤。因此，全社群众莫不欢欣鼓舞。
