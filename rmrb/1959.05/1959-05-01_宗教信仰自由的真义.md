The True Meaning of Religious Freedom
Speech by Committee Member Chen Yingning

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am very honored to participate in this meeting. Originally, I wanted to combine traditional Chinese medicine and Taoist Qigong into a speech, but I suddenly fell ill during the meeting and have not yet recovered. Therefore, I cannot present that academic paper. This manuscript was also hastily prepared in bed and copied by someone else. Some omissions in the middle could not be supplemented in time. There are many shortcomings, please forgive me.

I completely agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's "Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC." The last paragraph of the report, which discusses the five areas in which the CPPCC should strengthen its work in the future, is particularly important.

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, I felt extremely excited. Every word and sentence in each report shines with brilliant light, fully demonstrating the soaring spirit of hard work and bravery of the Chinese people, and also fully demonstrating the great achievements under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. I warmly support these reports.

I am already eighty years old. Since birth, I have experienced many internal and external troubles. Life experience has taught me a truth: only in the past ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has our great motherland achieved such unprecedented unity, rapid leaps forward, vigorous development, and prosperity. I have never seen anything like this in the past few decades, and I dared not even imagine it. Therefore, I am convinced that the Chinese Communist Party is the lucky star of our motherland, and firmly supporting the leadership of the Party means loving the motherland.

Everything related to socialist construction has already been discussed eloquently by everyone, and I am ashamed to have nothing to contribute. At this meeting, I am listed as a representative of the religious community, so I would like to talk about the issue of religious belief.

In the old social system and under reactionary rule in the past, most people's religious beliefs were influenced by the environment and not necessarily truly free. Some people were forced to join temples to make a living due to life's pressures; some people resorted to gods and Buddhas because they were plagued by illness and could not get medical treatment; and some people could not endure the disparity between the rich and the poor and the昏庸cruelty of the ruling class, so they reluctantly saw through the mortal world and became monks. Of course, there were also people who first understood the doctrines and then developed faith, but this was not the general situation. It is conceivable that in that era, people's religious beliefs were dominated by the bad social system, and their hearts were extremely painful. How could this be considered genuine freedom of belief?

Only in the ten years since liberation have people across the country been able to live and work in peace and contentment, without worrying about food and clothing; health and hygiene organizations have spread throughout urban and rural areas, and medical treatment is no longer a problem; the phenomenon of people exploiting and enslaving people has been completely eliminated. Living under such a social system, we can make choices, freely choose, freely discard, and freely decide on the issue of religious belief solely based on our individual will, without being affected by any external forces. No one will interfere whether you believe or not, believe in this or believe in that. This is in line with the true meaning of religious freedom. Our government has consistently protected the right of every citizen to have freedom of belief, and everyone respects this right in the big family of the motherland. We are enjoying freedom of belief, and outsiders say that we have no freedom of belief, isn't that a joke?

Belief is originally a matter of thought, and does not depend on external forms. Some counter-revolutionary elements, although they wear the cloak of religion, harbor a vicious beast's heart, pretending to be pious believers, but are actually man-eating demons. This is the case with the small handful of reactionary elements who launched the rebellion in Tibet this time. They only seek to maintain their status as serf owners for a long time, regardless of the suffering of the vast Tibetan people; when the central government wanted to eliminate the remaining imperialist forces in Tibet, they intensified their collusion with imperialism to carry out the rebellion; when the central government wanted to gradually improve the poor lives of the Tibetan people, they insisted on forever preserving the backward state of thousands of years; when the central government consistently respected the religious freedom of the Tibetan people, they insisted on forcing lamas to join the army, destroying the fundamental precepts of Buddhism, and instead claimed to be protecting religion. They are truly the scum of religion.

Our vast number of people in the religious community should love our motherland, support the State Council's order to quell the rebellion in Tibet, distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and recognize that these reactionary elements are betraying the country and also betraying religion, and harming the people is tantamount to self-destruction. These demons should be thoroughly eradicated so that the Tibetan people can be freed from the dark hell and embark on the road to brightness together with the 650 million people of the country. This approach is not only beneficial to the Tibetan people, but also beneficial to world peace. If someone speaks with honeyed words but harbors a sword in their belly, deliberately reversing black and white, saying that the Tibetan rebellion is related to religious belief, seemingly sympathizing with religion, but actually attempting to provoke the relationship between our vast number of believers and the government, this is what our religious community unanimously condemns, absolutely does not allow, and firmly opposes.

I wish the conference victory!
I wish everyone good health!

### 宗教信仰自由的真义

专栏：

    宗教信仰自由的真义
    陈樱宁委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我很荣幸的参加这次会议，当初本想把中国医学和道家气功两者结合起来做一篇发言稿子，但因在会期中忽然生了病，现在还没有复原，所以那种学术性的文章就不能做了。这篇稿子也是匆匆忙忙在病床上做的，又是请别人代为抄写，中间有些遗漏的地方也来不及补充进去，缺点甚多，请各位原谅。
    听了李维汉副主席“政协常委工作报告”，我完全同意；报告的末一段，谈到今后政协应当加强的五项工作，更是重要。
    听了周恩来总理“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念二位副总理的报告，我感到无比的兴奋。每个报告中一字一句都闪射着灿烂的光辉，充分显示了我国人民勤劳勇敢的冲天干劲，也充分显示了中国共产党和毛泽东主席英明领导下的伟大成就。我热烈拥护这几个报告。
    我的年龄已届八十岁，自出生以来，经过不少的内忧外患，生活经历告诉我一个真理：伟大的祖国，只是近十年来由中国共产党领导之后，才有这样空前的团结、飞快的跃进，蓬勃发展，欣欣向荣；已往几十年非但未曾见过，连想也不敢想。因此，我肯定中国共产党是我们祖国的福星，坚决拥护党的领导，就是热爱祖国。
    一切有关社会主义建设方面的意见，诸公早已畅所欲言，我自愧无所贡献。这次会议，我列名于宗教界，因此想谈一谈宗教信仰问题。
    在过去旧社会制度和反动统治之下，人们信仰宗教，多数是受了环境的影响，未必真是自由。有些人因为生活逼迫，不得不混入寺庙以图衣食；有些人因为疾病缠身，得不到医疗，无可奈何乞灵于神佛；又有些人因为不能忍受贫富之间的苦乐悬殊和统治阶级的昏庸残酷，勉强看破红尘而出家；至于先已懂得教义而后发生信仰的人，当然也有，但不是一般的情况。可以想见，那个时代人们信仰宗教，都是受着恶劣的社会制度所支配，内心本是极端痛苦，如何能够算得真正的信仰自由呢？
    只有在解放后十年以来，全国人民都能够安居乐业、衣食无忧；保健卫生机构遍布城乡，医疗方面已不感觉困难；人剥削人、人奴役人的现象已彻底消灭，我们生活在这样的社会制度之下，对于宗教信仰问题，才可以单凭个人的意志自由选择、自由取舍、自由决定，而不受任何外界力量的影响；信与不信，信这个或者信那个，也没有任何人会来干涉，这才符合宗教信仰自由的真义。我们的政府一贯保护每个公民在信仰方面有自由的权利，而且在祖国的大家庭中彼此也都互相尊重这种权利。我们正在享受信仰自由，局外人反说我们没有信仰自由，岂非笑话。
    信仰原是思想一方面事，并不在乎外表的形式。有些反革命分子，虽然披上了宗教外衣，但是其中却包藏了一颗恶毒的兽心，伪装着虔诚的教徒，实际上是吃人的魔鬼，这次发动西藏叛乱的一小撮反动分子就是如此。他们只图长久保持自己的农奴主地位，不管西藏广大人民的痛苦；中央要驱除西藏旧日残余的帝国主义势力，他们反而加紧勾结帝国主义进行叛乱；中央要逐渐改善西藏人民穷困的生活，他们偏要永远保守落后千年的状态；中央一贯尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰自由，他们偏要强迫喇嘛当兵，破坏佛教根本大戒，反而说是保护宗教，实在是宗教中的败类。
    我们广大的宗教界人士，应当热爱我们的祖国，拥护国务院平息西藏叛乱的命令，明辨是非，分清敌我，认识这些反动分子叛国又同时叛教，残害人民也就是自取毁灭，应该把这些魔鬼彻底肃清，好让西藏人民从黑暗地狱中翻身，和全国六亿五千万人民一起走上光明的大道。这样办法，不仅于西藏人民有利，对于世界和平更是有利。如果有人口蜜腹剑，故意颠倒黑白，说西藏叛乱事件和宗教信仰有关系，表面似乎是同情宗教，实际上是企图挑拨我国广大教徒与政府的关系。这是我们宗教界所一致愤慨的，所绝不容许的、所坚决反对的。
    祝大会胜利
    祝各位身体健康
