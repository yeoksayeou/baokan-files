Representative Deng Zhaoxiang Discusses Navy Sailors Self-Repairing Ships

Chairman, esteemed representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and wholeheartedly support them.

I am a naval officer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and I would like to report on what I have seen. Under the inspiration of the great leap forward in socialist construction across the country in 1958, and under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy has also seen a new landscape of great leap forward in all its work. Holding high the red banner of Chairman Mao's military thought, it conducted a rectification movement, socialist education, and communist education, greatly enhancing the communist consciousness of officers and soldiers, promoted the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, strengthened unity in all aspects, and improved combat effectiveness. As a result, it achieved significant victories in coastal military struggles, not only completing the arduous and glorious tasks of escorting fishing and merchant vessels, but also, in the combat struggle against Jinmen and Mazu, together with the brotherly forces of the Army and Air Force, victoriously punished the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's army and dealt it a severe blow. It implemented the principle of fighting, building, and training simultaneously, and completed the annual training tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas, and improved the quality compared with previous years. In order to respond to the Party's call to carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution, the broad masses, along with the brotherly units, enthusiastically participated in the training of being proficient in one specialty while capable in many, and one soldier with multiple skills, and widely carried out mass cultural education and recreational sports activities, resulting in a large number of valuable technological innovations and proposals, so that some of the existing combat equipment and materials have been enhanced in performance and improved in efficiency to varying degrees. It is understood that thousands of them are now being promoted within the Navy. The following is a brief description of the mass initiative of self-repairing ships, which has far-reaching significance.

According to regulations, ships must undergo minor or medium repairs in shipyards according to their service life, so that a portion of ships are often unable to sail and consume a lot of funds.

Although machines are sophisticated, they are ultimately made by people. Workers can repair them, and sailors can also repair them. Self-repairing ships has driven a movement of self-repairing equipment and materials such as artillery, torpedoes, automobiles, and airplanes.

The great rectification movement changed people's spiritual outlook, liberated their minds, and broke superstitions. In the tide of the great leap forward in March 1958, in order to strive for the upper reaches and implement the policy of building the army diligently and thriftily, a small number of comrades who frequently came into contact with machinery and equipment jointly studied and analyzed the actual situation, and felt that they should and were confident in relying mainly on the strength of the sailors themselves, with the support and assistance of other departments, to repair the ships well. Therefore, they bravely put forward a proposal. The naval leadership attached great importance to this budding innovation, immediately seized it, gave it enthusiastic support and full support, and called on all naval personnel to learn from this revolutionary spirit. The national fleet enthusiastically responded. Naval leaders in various regions selected "experimental fields" for various types of ships to explore experience, and vigorously provided specific guidance and assistance, so that they could complete the self-repair tasks more quickly and better, in order to demonstrate the superiority of this revolutionary initiative. As soon as there was a "harvest," on-site meetings were held to summarize experience, exchange experience, and introduce experience, in order to open up the road forward for this new thing with vivid facts and lively forms. Within half a year, it had blossomed everywhere and yielded full results. All ships have shifted from relying on factory repairs to self-repairs as the primary method (of course, shipyards still need to support and cooperate in the casting and processing of accessories and the training of sailors in craftsmanship). At the same time, it also drove the vigorous development of the self-repair movement of equipment and materials such as artillery, torpedoes, automobiles, and airplanes; and the work of agencies at all levels and even rules and regulations could not but undergo corresponding changes and innovations.

In the "farming" experience, it can be appreciated that self-repairing ships is a scientific, combat, and mass work, and it can only be completed smoothly by mobilizing the enthusiasm and perseverance of all personnel on the ship and carrying out technical democracy. The plan, tasks, and determination to repair the ship should be handed over to the masses for discussion in its entirety, explaining the great significance of self-repair, pointing out the favorable conditions and existing difficulties, trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and asking everyone to use their brains and find tricks to better solve key problems. After the sailors put politics in command and took the lead in thought, they showed the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to break, and daring to establish in the midst of great airing of views, great contention, and great debate. They believed that although machines are sophisticated and require strict requirements, they are ultimately made by people, and the comrades of the factory workers can repair them. They are usually used to it and understand the performance, so they should repair it better. Although they are not proficient in craftsmanship, can't they learn? Therefore, they encouraged each other, mustered up their energy, challenged, responded, and collectively made guarantees. Each, according to his own scope of responsibility, put forward opinions on the relevant modification plan, calculated the measures to be taken to complete the task, and confidently took on the task. Some sailors who had originally planned to take leave to go home to get married during the gap of ship repair according to usual habits also resolutely postponed the date; individual comrades who originally had doubts, in the midst of the vigorous challenges and responses, were also unwilling to fall behind, and reviewed and said: "My thinking is like a little-footed woman walking, swaying there, not as good as Zhang Gou, who is twelve years old. He can understand Chairman Mao's thoughts, dare to think and dare to do, and should learn from him and muster up his energy." Thus, the infinite power hidden in the masses was unearthed, turning the intentions of the leadership into the actions of the masses. Sailors wrote poems saying: "The warship decided to repair itself, and every sailor is proficient in every trade: the technician is also the squad leader, the engineer is the electromechanical chief, all the sailors on the ship are workers, and the factory director is our captain. At the captain's command, the sailors are happy and work hard together, and the warship becomes a repair shop!"

In liberating their minds, breaking superstitions, the masses can not only work actively, but also greatly develop their creative abilities. For example, when grinding the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine, because there was no large flat plate equipment in the factory, they held a Zhuge Liang meeting to study and decided to use two missing heads to carefully grind each other. After completion, the quality was tested and met the specifications; this broke the past experience and habits of the factory and innovated the method. Another example is when repairing the turbine main engine, according to regulations, auxiliary machines cannot be repaired in the same cabin. However, in order to complete the self-repair task as soon as possible, the masses discussed that the purpose of the regulations is for safety, and safety work should rely on the high political responsibility of the broad masses, and cannot simply rely on passive prevention. People in charge of politics can replace this regulation. So everyone made a guarantee to maintain a high degree of vigilance and supervise each other to avoid paralysis. Therefore, it was decided to repair the main engine and auxiliary engine at the same time, and other processes were also done in the same way, which greatly reduced the time for the entire repair. There are many such initiatives, and I will not list them all.

Cadres take the lead in labor, and the enthusiasm of the masses soars to the sky

In the process of repair, in order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, cadres took the lead, personally worked, and labored together with the masses to establish flesh-and-blood relations and unite closely. Everyone was more energetic. Sailors wrote poems saying: "Cadres take the lead and are not afraid of getting dirty, oil and sweat are all over their bodies, encouraging the soldiers to work hard and repair the warships to protect the national defense." It also said: "The leaders come to the ship to participate in ship repair. Although the task is difficult, it will definitely be achieved." Therefore, everyone participated in the repair work in a combat posture. For example, when entering the dock for descaling and painting, in order to complete it as soon as possible, the masses proposed "one inch of water down, ten points of rust removal", that is, when the dock is pumping water, where the water falls, the rust will be removed. When the water is pumped dry, the hull will be clean and ready for painting. Everyone resolutely responded to this battle slogan, and did not rest even when they were tired. When it was time to eat, the broadcast announced: "Please comrades come up to eat." Below, they said in unison: "Don't eat until it's done." Therefore, the original plan to complete the twenty-four-hour project in three days actually created an outstanding record of completing it in only three hours.

It can be seen that believing in the wisdom of the masses and relying on the strength of the masses is possible to repair the ships well with the sailors' own labor, ensuring quality and quantity. Of course, the exertion of the potential of the masses must rely on the leadership of the Party, because the education of the Party gives people lofty ideals, gives people the heat of life, liberates people's minds, and makes them soar to the sky; it makes everyone's energy twisted into a rope and makes great strength fall into place.

Sailors self-repairing ships saves the country expenses, increases the utilization rate of ships, and cultivates technical forces

Practice shows that sailors self-repairing ships is a practical action of the Navy to implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction. Self-repair can not only save a lot of expenses for the country on the basis of ensuring quality, spend less money, do more things, and do good things, but also promote the exertion of the production potential of factories. In peacetime, it can free up most of the labor force to support the country's industrial and agricultural construction. It is understood that last year, in addition to completing military tasks, the naval shipyard also undertook the task of manufacturing heavy civilian products. Self-repair can concentrate forces to make breakthroughs, and can save factory inspection time and various entrustment handover procedures. In other words, the sailing rate of ships is relatively increased, thereby greatly increasing the training time. In terms of the utilization rate of ships, about five ships can be used for every four ships, which is of great significance to improving the combat effectiveness of the troops. Self-repair has set off a wave of enthusiasm for learning technology and improving craftsmanship skills in the naval forces. Taking a certain machine repair group as an example, the group has a total of sixteen people. The craftsmanship level was only equivalent to apprentices at the beginning. After eighty-four days of self-repair, the assessment showed that two people reached the level of fourth-grade technicians, seven reached the level of third-grade technicians, and three reached the level of second-grade technicians. Through disassembly, repair, and installation, they became more familiar with the inside of the machine. They, together with other groups, wrote a technological study of more than 100,000 words, thereby uncovering the mystery of technology and realizing their own wisdom and power. Sailors said: "Use your brains, fight wits, we are all engineers." At the same time, we cannot but realize that when fighting on the vast ocean, the ability to timely and correctly eliminate machine failures will have a great impact on the confidence in victory in battle! Self-repair has enhanced the concept of cherishing weapons and equipment, so that maintenance work is done better, and also enhanced the labor concept and habits of sailors, and enhanced the collectivist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. In particular, cadres and soldiers work together, share weal and woe, hand their hearts to the masses, and in labor practice, they realize the infinite creative power of the masses and their infinite loyalty to the cause of socialism. In fact, it is also a good way to improve and transform the thinking style of cadres, which is the correct path to being both red and expert. Self-repair not only enables cadres to learn some technical management skills and improve their leadership ability in organizing mechanical repairs, but also makes the naval fleet a comprehensive school of military, political, industrial, and technological skills. It will train a large number of technical reserve forces for the country, thereby making a certain contribution to the country's modern industrial, agricultural, scientific, and cultural undertakings. Naval officers and soldiers will be able to serve as both defenders and builders of the motherland according to the needs of their work. More importantly, self-repair has cultivated the sailors' will to overcome difficulties, eliminated superstition and fear of technology, and broken the sense of inferiority, bringing naval technology to a new stage. The broad masses of officers and soldiers have become the masters of the machine, thereby opening up a shortcut to solve the contradiction between man and technology. It can liberate people's minds, inspire the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and be original, and make people more deeply realize that politics is the commander, thought is the soul, and the mass line is the fundamental line of all the Party's work.

Things are constantly developing. In the development process of this new thing, new contradictions have arisen. That is, the projects are too concentrated, the number of repair items is large, and the completion time is required to be as short as possible. This will inevitably lead to difficulties such as labor shortages, high labor intensity, insufficient technical strength, and inconvenient allocation and use of tools and equipment. In order to adapt to the development of work, the masses, with the spirit of continuous revolution, discovered contradictions, sought to solve contradictions, and timely proposed to implement the principle of prevention first, and to implement a decentralized repair method combining use, maintenance, and repair. This made repair work combined with daily maintenance and inspection, which initially solved the above contradictions. It is also possible to plan and organize repair and maintenance work according to the actual wear and tear of mechanical equipment, more scientifically maintain and use machines, more reasonably arrange repair manpower and resources, and appropriately arrange the time for ships to be repaired and sailing, so that the sailing rate of ships is greatly improved, which is more conducive to strengthening training and combat readiness.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the government, and with the encouragement and support of the people of the whole country, the construction of the new China's navy has reached a certain scale, and its combat effectiveness is stronger than ever in Chinese history. In the future, with the development of the country's industry and agriculture, the construction of our navy will inevitably become stronger and stronger, and will be able to cooperate with the army and air force to defend the motherland's national defense and the motherland's socialist construction.

    既是战斗员　又是技术员
    邓兆祥代表谈海军舰员自修舰船主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念两位副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并衷心拥护。
    我是中国人民解放军的海军军官，兹就所看到的情况汇报一下。在一九五八年全国社会主义建设大跃进形势的鼓舞下，中国人民解放军海军在党的总路线光辉照耀下，各项工作亦出现了大跃进的新局面。她高举毛主席军事思想的红旗，进行了整风运动，社会主义教育和共产主义教育，大大提高了官兵的共产主义觉悟，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，增强了各方面的团结，提高了战斗力。因而在沿海军事斗争中取得了重大胜利，不但完成了艰巨的护渔、护航的光荣任务，而且在对金、马作战斗争中，和陆、空军兄弟部队一起，胜利地进行了惩罚金门蒋介石卖国集团军队，并予以严重的打击。她贯彻了边战，边建，边训的原则，更提前和超额完成了年度各项训练任务，并在质量方面比往年有所提高。为着响应党的开展技术革命和文化革命，广大群众随着兄弟部队，热烈参加一专多能和一兵多用的锻炼，并广泛开展了群众性的文化教育和文娱体育活动，出现了大量有价值的技术革新和创议，使部分现有的战斗装备和器材在不同程度上得到了增强性能和提高效率。据了解现在海军内部推广的数以千计。兹就比较上有深远意义的舰船实行自修这一群众性创举略述于后。
    按条例规定，舰船要按使用期限进船厂小修或中修，因而经常有一部分舰船不能航行，并耗费大量经费。
    机器虽然精细，但究竟是人做出来的。工人能修、舰员也能修；舰船自修，带动了一个大炮、鱼雷、汽车、飞机等装备器材也自修的运动
    伟大的整风运动改变了人们精神面貌，解放了思想，破除了迷信，在一九五八年三月间全民大跃进浪潮中，为了力争上游，贯彻勤俭建军的方针，少数经常接触机器装备的同志，共同研究，分析了实际情况，觉得应该而且有把握地依靠舰员自己的力量为主，在其它部门支援协助下，修好舰船。因而勇敢提出倡议。海军领导十分重视这一革新的萌芽，立即抓住，给予热情赞助和全力支持，号召全海军人员学习这种革命精神。全国舰艇部队热烈响应。各地区海军领导纷纷选舰种“试验田”，摸索经验，大力给予具体指导和帮助，使能更快更好地完成自修任务，以显示这一革命创举的优越性。一有“收获”，即开现场会议，总结经验，交流经验，介绍经验，以生动的事实，活泼的形式，为这一新事物开辟前进道路。半年之内，就已普遍开花，全面结果，所有舰船都从以前的依靠工厂修理转变为自己为主进行自修的局面（当然对于配件的铸制、加工以及培训舰员工艺等，还要船厂支持协作）。同时，它还带动大炮、鱼雷、汽车、飞机等装备器材的自修运动蓬蓬勃勃开展；而各级机关的工作以至规章制度亦不能不来一个相应转变进行革新。
    在“种田”经验中，能够体会到自修舰船是一项科学性、战斗性、群众性的工作，只有动员全舰人员的干劲和钻劲，开展技术民主，才能顺利完成。修舰的计划、任务、决心应全盘交给群众讨论，说明自修意义的重大，指出有利条件和存在的困难，相信群众，依靠群众，要大家动脑筋、找窍门，才能更好解决关键问题。舰员在政治挂帅，思想领先之后，大鸣、大放、大争、大辩中，表现出敢想、敢说、敢破、敢立的精神，认为机器虽然精细，要求严格，但究竟是人做出来的，工厂工人同志能够修理，自己平常使用惯了，懂得性能，应该修理得更好，工艺方面，虽不通晓，难道不能学习吗？因而互相勉励，鼓足干劲，挑战、应战，集体订保证，各就自己的职责范围，提出有关修改计划的意见，计算完成任务所采取的措施，满怀信心地担当起来；有些舰员本来预定按平常习惯，利用修船间隙，请假回家结婚的，亦毅然推迟日期；原来存有疑虑的个别同志，在轰轰烈烈的挑战、应战中，亦不甘于落后，检讨说：“自己的思想好像小脚女人走路一样，在那里一摇三晃，还不如十二岁的张狗丢，他能领会毛主席的思想，敢想敢作，应该向他学习，鼓足干劲。”于是蕴藏在群众中的无穷力量，被挖掘出来了，使领导的意图变成了群众的行动，水兵写诗说：“军舰决定要自修，水兵各个通各行：技师由咱班长兼，工程师就是机电长，全舰水兵当工人，厂长就是咱舰长。舰长一声命令下，水兵欢心齐苦干，军舰变成修理厂！”
    在解放了思想，破除了迷信，群众不只能工作积极，而且还会大大发挥创造能力，如在研磨内燃机气缸头时，因没有工厂的大平板设备，就开诸葛亮会研究，决定用两个缺头，仔细地互相研磨，完成后经检验质量合乎规格；这就打破了过去工厂历来的经验和习惯，革新方法。又如修理透平主机时，按规定不能在同一仓内修理辅助机器，但为着能早日完成自修任务，群众讨论，认为规定的目的，是为了安全出发，而安全工作应依靠广大群众的高度政治责任感，不能单纯依赖消极的防范，政治挂了帅的人负责行动就可以代替这一规定。于是大家提出保证，绝对保持高度警惕，互相监督不麻痹大意。因而决定主机、辅机同时修理，齐头并进，其它许多工序，亦是如此，这就大大缩减了整个修理的时间，诸如此类的创议很多，不再枚举。
    干部带头劳动，群众干劲冲天
    在修理过程中，为了多快好省，干部带头，亲自动手，与群众共同劳动，建立血肉关系，亲密团结，大家劲头更大，水兵写诗说：“干部带头不怕脏，油水汗水满身淌，鼓舞战士干劲大，修好军舰保国防。”又说：“首长来舰，参加修船，任务虽艰，一定实现。”因此个个都以战斗的姿态参加修理工作，如当进坞敲锈油漆时，为着及早完成，群众提出“水落一寸，除锈十分”，即是当船坞抽水时，水落到那里，锈就清除到那里，水抽干了，船体也就干净了，好涂油漆。大家坚决响应这一战斗口号，虽累了亦不休息。吃饭时间到了，广播传出：“请同志们上来吃饭”，下边异口同声说：“不干完不吃饭”。因而把原定计划要分三天来干的二十四个小时的工程，竟创造出只用三个小时就完成了的突出纪录。
    由此可见，相信群众的智慧，依靠群众的力量，是可能使用舰员自己的劳动把舰船修理好，保质保量。当然，群众潜力的发挥必须依靠党的领导，因为党的教育，给予人们崇高的理想，给予人们生活的热力，使人们的思想获得解放，干劲冲天；使大家的干劲能够拧成一股绳，使巨大的力量落到实处。
    舰员自修舰船为国家节约了开支，增加了舰船使用率，培养了技术力量
    实践说明：舰员自修舰船是海军贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的实际行动。自修不仅可以在保证质量的基础上为国家节约大量开支，少花钱，多办事，办好事，同时对工厂生产潜力的发挥亦起促进作用，在和平时期能腾出大部分劳动力支援国家工、农业建设，据了解去年海军修船厂除完成军事任务外，还承担制造繁重的民用产品任务。自修可以集中力量突击，可节省工厂勘验时间，和各种委托交接手续，换一句话，就是舰船的在航率相对增加，从而大大增加了训练的时间，就舰船使用率来算，则每四艘中，大约可作五艘使用，这对提高部队战斗力有着重要意义。自修掀起了海军部队学习技术的热潮，提高工艺技能，举某一机器修理小组为例，该组共十六人，工艺水平始初只相当于徒工，经过八十四天的自修后评核，达四级技工水平者有二人，达三级者七人，达二级者三人。通过拆卸、修理、安装，对机器内部更熟悉了，他们结合其它各组曾写出一本十余万字的工艺学，从而揭开技术神秘的盖子，认识到自己的智慧和力量。水兵说：“动脑筋，要斗智，咱们都是工程师。”同时还不能不体会到在辽阔的海洋上进行作战时，机器发生故障后能及时正确排除，这对战斗的胜利信心影响是多么大！自修增强了爱护武器装备的观念，使维护保养工作做得更好，还增强了舰员劳动观念和习惯，增进了互助协作的集体主义精神，尤其是干部与战士同劳动同甘共苦，把心交给群众，在劳动实践中体会到群众无限的创造力量和对社会主义事业的无限忠诚，事实上亦是干部思想作风提高与改造的很好方式，也就是通向红与专的正确道路。自修不仅使干部学到了一部分技术管理的本领，提高了组织机械修理的领导能力，同时舰艇部队也成了一所军事、政治、工业技术的综合学校，它将为国家培养大批技术后备力量，从而为国家现代化的工、农业、科学文化事业作出一定的贡献，海军官兵将根据工作的需要既可做祖国的保卫者又可做祖国的建设者。更重要的是自修培养了舰员战胜困难的意志，破除了对技术的迷信、恐惧和打破自卑感，使海军技术走上一个新的阶段，广大官兵成了机器的主人，从而对解决人与技术的矛盾开辟了一条捷径。它能解放人们思想，启发敢想、敢说、敢作和独创精神，使人们比较深刻地认识到政治是统帅，思想是灵魂，群众路线是党的一切工作的根本路线的真理。
    事物是不断发展的，在这一新的事物发展过程中，又产生了新的矛盾。即是工程过于集中，修理项目数量多，而完成时间又要求越短越好，这样势必产生劳动力紧张，劳动强度大，技术力量不足和工具器材调配使用不便等困难。为适应工作的发展，群众以不断革命的精神，发现矛盾，谋求解决矛盾，及时提出贯彻预防为主，使用、保养、修理三结合原则实行分散修理的办法，使修理工作结合于平日维护保养、检修中进行，这就初步解决了上述矛盾，并且还可以按照机械装备磨耗的实际情况来计划和组织修理、保养工作，更科学地维护和使用机器，可以更合理地安排修理的人力和物力，可以适当安排舰船在修和在航的时间，使舰船在航率又大大提高一步，更有利于训练和战备的加强。
    新中国的海军建设在党中央、毛主席和政府的正确领导下，在全国人民的鼓舞和支持下已有一定的规模，其战斗力的强大为中国历史所从没有过。今后随着国家工农业的发展，我国海军的建设必然日益强大，并能配合陆军和空军保卫祖国国防和祖国的社会主义建设。
