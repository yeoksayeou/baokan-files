Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report and the work reports of the central leaders. These reports are of great educational value and encouragement to me. I will certainly follow the instructions in the Premier's report and, together with all my worker brothers, strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

I also agree with the speeches made by the representatives on the Tibet issue. I am extremely angry at the blatant interference in our internal affairs by imperialists and Indian interventionists, and their shameless attacks and slanders against our great motherland. What I find particularly intolerable is that Indian reactionaries openly insulted the image of our great leader Chairman Mao. We express our firm protest against this. We want to warn the Indian interventionists that the days when China could be bullied at will are long gone. Anyone who wants to split our great motherland will inevitably be smashed to pieces!

Now I will briefly report to the conference on the trial production of two new products by the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory in the Great Leap Forward of 1958 - the high-speed carding machine and the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator.

　　Made a High-Speed Carding Machine with Four Times the Efficiency

Let's talk about the carding machine first. Last year, under the correct leadership of the Party committee and encouraged by the general line of socialist construction, with the strong support and assistance of fraternal factories, the workers of our factory emancipated their minds, broke superstitions, and, after nine months of hard work, successfully trial-produced a high-speed carding machine. This carding machine produces 22 kilograms per hour, four times the efficiency of the original carding machine (5.5 kilograms per hour). It surpasses the United Kingdom and the United States and reaches the advanced world level. Due to the increased production capacity, investment in new textile mills will be greatly reduced in the future. We calculated that if the number of carding machines equipped for every 10,000 spindles is reduced from the original 48 to 12-14, based on the national construction of 2.5 million new spindles per year, 30 million yuan in machine manufacturing costs can be saved, 40,000 tons of steel can be saved, and 100,000 square meters of factory buildings can be saved. At the same time, the successful trial production of this carding machine further emancipated the minds of the workers and promoted the technical revolution movement throughout the factory.

How was the high-speed carding machine successfully trial-produced? The process was as follows: From the second half of 1957 to the beginning of 1958, the workers of our factory made bold reforms to the carding machine, and the efficiency increased by more than 40% compared to before. Everyone was very happy and felt that this was not easy. At this time, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, issued the great call to catch up with the United Kingdom within fifteen years, and called on the people of the whole country to establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. The great call and instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were like a lighthouse, illuminating our hearts and giving us strength. The original complacency disappeared all at once. Everyone said that our thinking was conservative, and to build socialism and catch up with the United Kingdom as soon as possible, it was not enough to walk slowly, but to run barefoot. Some workers proposed to double the output, and some proposed to improve the carding machine to increase its efficiency several times; but some people disagreed, saying, how is that possible, catching up with the United Kingdom is not easy, it has to be done slowly. At this time, our factory Party committee led the workers of the whole factory in a great airing of views, a great debate, and asked everyone to discuss how to go all out, aim high, and catch up with the United Kingdom. The discussion was very lively. After this great discussion, the minds of the workers throughout the factory were emancipated, the enthusiasm was even greater, and a Great Leap Forward plan was drawn up (the carding machine was leaped from the original plan of 2,300 units to 4,100 units, and the motor was leaped from 40,000 kilowatts to 83,000 kilowatts), and it was decided to trial-produce a high-speed carding machine with four times the efficiency. After the task was determined, actions were immediately taken to organize a trial production working group composed of leading cadres, technicians, and veteran workers, adopting the method of researching, designing, trial-producing, improving, and finalizing the design at the same time, and the trial production work was quickly launched.

Throughout the entire research and trial production process, the workers of the whole factory displayed soaring enthusiasm, worked hard, overcame countless difficulties, and underwent many ideological struggles. For example, after several months of hard work by the workers of the whole factory, the first high-speed carding machine was made. After installation and testing, the output had reached four times, but the quality was not good, and there were still many problems, such as abnormal back waste, overheating of the roller bearing, and the stripping mechanism and transmission method could not bear the requirements of high-speed operation, and so on. At this time, some people were discouraged. Some people believed that the mechanical structure was not suitable for high speed and high output, and advocated slowing down and reducing output, going back to conduct experiments with one and two times the speed; some even said: "Foreigners have not dared to make major changes to the carding machine for many years, obviously we are messing around blindly." The situation was very chaotic. At this time, according to the instructions of the Party committee, an airing of views and debate was launched among all members of the group. After the airing of views and debate, everyone's thinking was unified, confidence was enhanced, and then efforts were concentrated on tackling key problems. When solving these key problems, the workers put in even more effort. For example, in order to solve the problem that the stripping mechanism could not adapt to high-speed operation, we studied dozens of schemes and conducted more than seventy experiments. Worker Yu Yuanzhi worked for two days and two nights without rest in order to complete the welding of the metal needle cloth in time. The leaders persuaded him to rest, but he did not listen. Finally, he was ordered to rest, but after the leaders left, he secretly ran back to the workshop to work. Veteran worker Wei Ziming, after painstaking research, changed the line transmission of the stripping roller to graded transmission, which played a great role in solving the stripping problem. After the joint research and experimentation of workers and technicians, the experiment of changing the beater blade stripping to roller stripping was finally successful, solving the stripping problem that had the greatest impact on quality. Worker Wang Chunfu from State-owned Cotton Factory No. 4, who helped with the trial production work in our factory, went to work at 7:00 a.m. and left work at 10:00 p.m. every day, and persisted for four months. The leaders repeatedly mobilized him to rest, but he always said: "Our work is far less than the spirit of the volunteers fighting the American devils in Korea. To catch up with the United Kingdom, we have to work hard." The comrades of the working group did not rest for three months and often worked until late at night. Through everyone's efforts, all the key problems were solved one by one. In this way, relying on the cooperation of workers and technicians, relying on everyone's hard work and perseverance, overcoming various difficulties, and under the condition of completing normal production tasks, the high-speed carding machine was finally successfully trial-produced at the end of the year. The quality was good after testing. All the workers felt very happy and proud.

    Made a 6,000 Kilowatt Steam Turbine Generator

Now let's talk about the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator. In the past, our factory only made small motors and had never made generators. We didn't even dare to think about making a 6,000-kilowatt generator. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, our minds were emancipated and we became bolder. Therefore, while trial-producing the high-speed carding machine, we also carried out the trial production of the 6,000-kilowatt generator. In the process of trial production, we encountered even more difficulties. For example, there was no 600 mm large steel for manufacturing the rotor, no 3-meter vertical lathe for processing the ingot, and no 150-ton oil press for assembling and pressing the ingot, and so on. But thanks to the leadership and encouragement of the Party and the support of fraternal factories, we were not afraid of any difficulties. The workers of the whole factory contributed ideas and suggestions, and there were many methods and great strength. As a result, we created fifteen kinds of processes, adopted five kinds of substitute materials, manufactured twelve indigenous equipment, and overcame various difficulties, and successfully trial-produced the generator at the end of the year. The quality also fully met the technical standards.

The above is a brief account of the trial production of high-speed carding machines and 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators in our factory.

In the past year, the workers of our factory have achieved some results under the leadership of the Party, but we are not satisfied. We are determined to further emancipate our minds, go all out, and make greater achievements. Now we are further researching and improving the high-speed carding machine so that its efficiency can be increased by another four times on the basis of increasing it four times. We have the confidence and determination to realize this plan.

　　群众是真武松　困难是纸老虎
    刘同诰代表谈青岛纺织机械厂工人和技术人员通力合作创造奇迹主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告和中央各位首长的工作报告。这些报告对我有很大的教育和鼓舞，我一定遵照总理报告中的指示，和全体工人弟兄一道，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    我也同意各位代表对西藏问题的发言。我对帝国主义和印度的干涉主义分子明目张胆干涉我国内政、攻击污蔑我们伟大祖国的无耻行为，极为气愤。特别使我不能容忍的是印度的反动分子公然侮辱我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像，我们对此表示坚决抗议。我们要警告印度干涉主义分子，中国受人随意欺侮的日子早已过去了，谁要想分裂我们伟大的祖国必然要碰得头破血流！
    现在我把青岛纺织机械厂在一九五八年大跃进中试制两种新产品——高速梳棉机和六千瓩汽轮发电机的情况向大会简要汇报一下。
　　制成效率提高四倍的高速梳棉机
    先说说梳棉机。去年我厂职工在上级党的正确领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，在兄弟厂的大力支援协助下，解放了思想，破除了迷信，经过九个月的苦战，试制成功了一种高速梳棉机。这种梳棉机，每台每小时产量二十二公斤，比原来的梳棉机（每小时产量五点五公斤）提高效率四倍。超过了英、美，达到世界先进水平。由于提高了生产能力，今后新建纺织厂投资就会大大减少。我们算了一下账，如果每一万纱锭所配备的梳棉机，由原来的四十八台减少到十二——十四台，按全国全年新建二百五十万纱锭计算，就可节省机器制造费三千万元，节约钢铁材料四万吨，节约厂房十万平方公尺。同时，这种梳棉机的试制成功，进一步解放了职工的思想，促进了全厂的技术革命运动。
    高速梳棉机是怎样试制成功的呢？经过是这样的：一九五七年下半年到一九五八年初，我厂职工对梳棉作了大胆地改革，效率比以前提高了百分之四十以上，大伙很高兴，觉得这很不简单了。就在这个时候，党中央和毛主席提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，发出了十五年内赶上英国的伟大号召，并号召全国人民树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。党中央和毛主席的伟大号召和指示，真像灯塔一样，一下子把我们的心照亮了，浑身都增了力量，原来的那股自满劲一下子没有了。大伙都说咱的思想保守了，要早日建成社会主义，赶上英国，用小步走路是不行的，得光着脚跑。有些工人同志提出要把产量翻一番，有的提出要改进梳棉机，使它的效率提高几倍；可是也有些人不同意，他们说，那还办得到，赶英国也不是简单的，得慢慢来。这时我们厂党委就领导全厂职工大鸣大放大辩论，让大伙讨论怎样鼓干劲、争上游、赶英国。讨论的可热烈啦，经过这场大讨论，全厂职工的思想解放了，干劲更足了，订出了一个大跃进的计划（梳棉机由原计划二千三百台跃为四千一百台，电动机由四万瓩跃为八万三千瓩），并决定试制提高效率四倍的高速梳棉机。任务确定后马上行动起来，组织了有领导干部，技术人员，老工人参加的试制工作组，采取边研究、边设计、边试制、边改进、边定型的方法，很快的展开了试制工作。
    在整个研究试制过程中，全厂职工同志发挥了冲天干劲，苦干苦钻，克服了无数的困难，经过了多次的思想斗争。比如经过全厂职工几个月的苦战制成了第一台高速梳棉机，经过安装试验，产量已经达到了四倍，但质量不好，问题还很多，后落棉不正常，龙头摇头发热，剥棉机构和传动方式承担不了高速运转的要求，等等。这时有些人就泄气了。有的人认为机械结构不适应高速高产，主张减速减产，倒回头来进行一倍、二倍的试验；有的甚至说：“外国人对梳棉机多年都没敢大改大动，显然咱是瞎胡闹。”情况非常混乱。这时，根据党委指示，在全组人员中展开了鸣放辩论。经过鸣放辩论，统一了大家的思想，增强了信心，于是就集中力量围攻关键问题。在解决这些关键问题的时候，职工同志们更是用尽了心血。比如为了解决剥棉机构不能适应高速运转的问题，我们曾研究了几十个方案，进行了七十多次的试验。工人于远志同志为了及时完成金属针布的焊接工作，曾经两天两夜不休息，领导上劝他休息，他也不听，最后命令他休息，可是当领导离开了以后，他又偷着跑到车间干起来。老工人魏子明，经过苦心钻研，把剥棉辊的列系传动改为分级传动，对解决剥棉问题起了很大作用。经过工人和技术人员齐心合力地研究试验，终于把改斩刀剥棉为罗拉剥棉试验成功，解决了影响质量最大的剥棉问题。在我厂帮助试制工作的国棉四厂工人王春福同志，每天早七点上班，晚十点下班，一直坚持四个月，领导上多次动员他休息，他总是说：“咱干这点活比志愿军在朝鲜打美国鬼子的劲头差多啦，要赶上英国就得使劲干。”工作组的同志三个月没歇星期，经常工作到深夜。经过大家的努力，所有的关键问题都一一解决了。就这样依靠工人和技术人员的合作，依靠大家苦干苦钻，克服了种种困难，在完成正常生产任务的情况下，高速梳棉机终于在年底试制成功了。经过试验质量良好。全厂职工都感到很高兴很光荣。
    制成六千瓩的汽轮发电机
    现在再说一说六千瓩的汽轮发电机。过去我厂只做小型电动机，从来没有做过发电机，做六千瓩的发电机连想也不敢想。在大跃进的形势下，我们的思想解放了，胆子大了。所以，我们在试制高速梳棉机的同时，也进行了六千瓩发电机的试制。在试制过程中，遇到的困难更多了。比如制造转子没有六百米厘大型钢材，锭子加工没有三米的立式车床，装压锭子缺乏一百五十吨的油压机等等。但是由于有党的领导和鼓舞，有兄弟厂的支援，我们什么困难也不怕。全厂职工有计的献计，有策的献策，人多办法多，力量大，结果创造了十五种工艺，采用了五种代用料，制造十二项土设备，战胜了种种困难，于年底胜利试制成功了。质量也完全符合技术标准。
    以上就是我厂试制高速梳棉机和六千瓩汽轮发电机的简单情况。
    一年来，我厂职工在党的领导下虽然取得了一些成绩，但我们并不满足，我们决心进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，来做出更大的成绩。现在我们正在对高速梳棉机作进一步地研究改进，以便使它的效率在提高四倍的基础上，再提高四倍。我们有信心有决心实现这个计划。
