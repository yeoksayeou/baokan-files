Setting Out Fully Equipped
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Packaging supplies, after all, are just "small things" like boxes, bags, baskets, crates, and bottles and jars, which don't seem to be "major players." However, without packaging, most commodities cannot be shipped or stored, and thus cannot serve production and consumption at all. This is a major matter that cannot be ignored. Just imagine: how can fertilizers and pesticides be transported from factories to rural areas without packaging? How can eggs be transported from rural areas to cities without baskets and crates? It can be seen that although packaging supplies are a small matter, they are of great importance. The objective laws of economic life require us to correctly handle the relationship between the key and the general. It is certainly not okay to fail to grasp the key, but discarding the general will also affect the key. Packaging supplies are an example of this.

Due to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the output of various products has greatly increased. The fact that packaging supplies are not keeping up with the growth of product needs is still a pressing contradiction that needs to be resolved. There are many ways to solve this contradiction. First, actively arrange production, which is also the most important. Our country has great potential for the production of packaging supplies and raw materials. The South is rich in rice, and the North is rich in wheat. Rice straw, wheat straw, and many wild plants are good raw materials for producing various straw paperboards and straw board boxes. Bamboo, brambles, reeds, cattails, etc., are everywhere, and are most suitable for weaving baskets and crates. The production of these things does not require any complicated equipment, and the technology is easy to learn. Many commune members and handicraft workers in the people's communes have always had the technology and habit of making and weaving these things, and can use local materials and process them locally. Second, conserve and substitute. For some packaging supplies that use wood, cotton, hemp, iron, etc., as raw materials, we can consider using bamboo, wild fibers, cardboard, or bamboo boards to replace them, or make them thinner and smaller, and reduce the number of packaging layers, provided that the quality and safety of the goods are not affected. In this way, it is easier to obtain materials for making packaging supplies, and those more important materials can be used to support the needs of national construction. Third, organize recycling. Many packaging supplies, such as bottles, boxes, iron drums, etc., remain intact from transportation all the way to sales departments and consumers, and can be reused many times. Some packaging supplies, such as toothpaste tubes, although they cannot be reused in their original form, can also be recycled and reprocessed. These things are of no use to consumers, but recycling them can turn useless things into useful ones. As long as consumers are made aware of the significance of recycling, and some reasonable recycling prices and convenient methods for the masses to sell are formulated, the masses will strongly support it.

It is worth mentioning that packaging supplies must not only increase in quantity, but also improve in quality. The main role of packaging is to protect commodities. If the quality of packaging supplies is not good, and they break before they are delivered to production units and consumers, the commodities will inevitably be damaged. Especially for some commodities that need to be transported long distances, and commodities that are sold abroad, the packaging needs to be more solid because of frequent handling.

Finally, in the current situation where packaging supplies cannot fully meet the needs, the supply of packaging supplies should also be differentiated according to priorities. Otherwise, it will lead to unreasonable phenomena such as some urgently needed commodities not being packaged, while some commodities that are not so urgently needed are packaged; or higher-grade packaging being used for short-distance transportation, while general and simple packaging being used for long-distance transportation.

    包装用品，无非是些箱子、袋子、筐子、篓子以及瓶瓶罐罐之类的“小东西”，看来算不得什么“主要角色”。但是，若不经过包装，绝大部分商品就无法启运，也无法储存，以致根本不能为生产和消费服务，这却是一件不能忽视的大事。试想：化肥和农药不经过包装怎能从工厂运到农村？鸡蛋没有篓、筐之类的东西盛装，怎能从农村运进城市？可见，包装用品事情虽小，关系甚大。经济生活本身的客观规律要求我们正确对待重点和一般的关系，不抓住重点当然不行，可是丢掉一般，也会影响重点。包装用品就是一例。
    由于工农业大跃进，各种产品的产量大量增加，包装用品跟不上产品增长需要仍然是目前一个迫切需要解决的矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，办法是很多的。一是积极安排生产，这也是最主要的。我国包装用品和原材料生产的潜力很大；南方盛产稻谷，北方盛产小麦，稻草和麦秆及不少野生植物都是生产各种草板纸和草板箱的好原料；竹子、荆条、芦苇、蒲草等到处都有，最适于编筐编篓。生产这些东西不需要什么复杂的设备，技术也容易学，很多人民公社的社员、手工业工人历来就有制做和编结这些东西的技术和习惯，可以就地取材，就地加工。二是节约、代用。某些以木、棉、麻、铁等为原料的包装用品，可以考虑在不影响商品质量和安全的条件下，用竹子、野生纤维、纸板或竹板等来代替，或者厚改薄，大改小，减少包装层次。这样，制做包装用品取材较容易，又可以把那些更重要的材料支援国家建设需要。三是组织回收。许多包装用品，如瓶子、箱子、铁筒等，从调运一直到售货部门和消费者手里，仍旧完好无损，完全可以再次、多次使用。有的包装用品如牙膏管等，虽然不能原物再用，但也可以回炉加工再制。这些东西对消费者来说没有什么用处，可是回收起来，就能变无用为有用。只要让消费者知道回收的意义，制定一些合理的回收价格和便于群众交售的办法，群众是会大力支持的。
    值得提出的是，包装用品不仅要增加数量，而且要提高质量。包装的主要作用是保护商品。如果包装用品的质量不好，还没有送到生产单位和消费者手里就破裂了，必然使商品受到损坏。特别是一些需要远程运输的商品，向国外销售的商品，因为搬运频繁，包装更需要牢固。
    最后，在目前包装用品还不能完全满足需要的情况下，包装用品的供应也应该分别轻重缓急。否则就会造成有些急需调运的商品得不到包装，而一些暂时不太急需调运的商品却得到了包装；或者是运程近的用了较高级的包装，运程远的反而用的是一般简单的包装等不合理的现象。
