Since the Chaoyang Market in Chaoyangmen Inner Street, Beijing, began recycling packaging supplies on March 14th of this year, it has recovered more than 4,800 various packaging items such as vegetable baskets, burlap sacks, and wooden boxes from 130 units including government offices, organizations, factories, and restaurants. It would cost more than 8,000 yuan to replace these tools.

Before recycling packaging supplies, the market had only a dozen or so items left. Due to the lack of packaging supplies, incoming goods had to be unpacked and displayed in bulk, which not only increased losses but also affected the quality of goods and sales efficiency. After the implementation of packaging supply recycling, the market has basically solved the need for packaging supplies this year. (Attached picture)

    他们不愁没包装用品了
    北京朝阳门内朝阳市场自今年3月14日开始回收包装用品以来，到目前为止，已从机关、团体、工厂、饭店等一百三十个单位收回了菜筐、麻袋、木箱等各种包装用品四千八百多件。如要重新添置这些工具，需要花费八千多元。
    在回收包装用品以前，这个市场只剩下了十几件。因缺少包装用品，进货只好散装散放，不但损耗增大，还影响了商品质量和售货效率。开展包装用品回收后，基本上解决了今年的包装用品的需要。（附图片）
