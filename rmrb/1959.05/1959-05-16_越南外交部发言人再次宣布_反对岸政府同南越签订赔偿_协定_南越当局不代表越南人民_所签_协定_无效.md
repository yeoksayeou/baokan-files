Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th: Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman Phan Hien announced again at a press conference held today that the so-called "War Compensation Agreement" signed by the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government with the South Vietnamese authorities on May 13 is completely invalid. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly opposes this so-called "agreement."

The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's action is a hostile act against the Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Kishi Nobusuke government must bear full responsibility for the consequences caused by this action.

Phan Hien said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is using Article 14 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty as the basis for signing the "War Compensation Agreement" separately with the South Vietnamese authorities, but this "basis" is completely untenable. Because the Democratic Republic of Vietnam did not participate in the San Francisco Conference and sign the San Francisco Peace Treaty. At the same time, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued statements twice in July and September 1951, opposing the Bao Dai regime, a puppet of France, from stealing the name of the Vietnamese people to participate in the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty.

Phan Hien said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's actions violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords. According to the Geneva Accords, the South Vietnamese authorities only have the power to temporarily administer South Vietnam and can never represent the entire Vietnamese people.

Phan Hien pointed out that the conspiracy behind the Kishi Nobusuke government's actions mainly serves the interests of Japanese monopoly capital and the policy of US imperialism to interfere in South Vietnam. According to the so-called "agreement" signed by Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities on May 13, Japan will supply South Vietnam with Japanese compensation materials equivalent to US$39 million within five years, and will provide South Vietnam with loans equivalent to US$16.6 million. In this way, the surplus materials of Japanese monopoly capital will flow into the South Vietnamese market in greater quantities, causing a greater crisis for South Vietnam's national industry and commerce.

Phan Hien praised the Japanese people for their struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's unilateral war reparations to South Vietnam. He said that he believes the Japanese people will continue to fight resolutely with the Vietnamese people to force the aforementioned illegal "War Compensation Agreement" from being passed by the Japanese Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 14th: News: Representatives of 50 Japanese trading companies unanimously passed a resolution at a conference held in Tokyo on the 13th, stating that they would prevent the Japanese Diet from ratifying the war compensation agreement signed by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique on the 13th.

These trading companies are all members of the Japan-Vietnam Trade Association. They also sent a telegram to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing their opposition to this war compensation agreement.

The association also decided to actively participate in the National Assembly for Improving Relations between Japan and China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, scheduled to be held in Tokyo on the 18th.

    越南外交部发言人再次宣布
    反对岸政府同南越签订赔偿“协定”
    南越当局不代表越南人民　所签“协定”无效
    新华社河内14日电　越南外交部发言人潘贤在今天举行的记者招待会上再一次宣布：日本岸信介政府在5月13日同南越当局签订的所谓“战争赔偿协定”是完全无效的。越南民主共和国政府坚决反对这个所谓“协定”。
    外交部发言人指出，岸信介政府的这种行为是一种对越南人民和越南民主共和国的敌对行为。岸信介政府必须对它的这种行为所引起的后果负完全责任。
    潘贤说，岸信介政府以旧金山和约第十四条作为同南越当局单独签订“战争赔偿协定”的根据，但是这种“根据”是完全站不住脚的。因为越南民主共和国并没有参加旧金山会议和签订旧金山和约，同时，越南民主共和国政府曾经在1951年7月和9月先后两次发表声明，反对作为法国傀儡的保大政权的代表窃取越南人民的名义参加签订旧金山和约。
    潘贤说，岸信介政府的行为违反了日内瓦协议的规定。根据日内瓦协议，南越当局只有暂时管理南越的权力，而决不能代表全体越南人民。
    潘贤指出，岸信介政府上述行为的阴谋主要是为日本垄断资本的利益和美帝国主义干涉南越的政策服务。因为根据岸信介政府外务相藤山爱一郎5月13日同吴庭艳当局签订的所谓“协定”，日本将在五年内以相当于三千九百万美元的日本赔偿物资供应南越，并将给南越相当于一千六百六十万美元的贷款。这样，就将使日本垄断资本的剩余物资更加大量地流入南越市场，使南越民族工商业遭到更大的危机。
    潘贤赞扬日本人民为反对岸信介政府单独给南越以战争赔偿而进行的斗争。他说，相信日本人民将继续同越南人民一起坚决斗争，来迫使上述非法的“战争赔偿协定”不能在日本国会上获得通过。
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本五十个贸易公司的代表13日在东京举行的大会上一致通过决议说，它们要阻止日本国会批准岸信介政府和南越吴庭艳集团在13日签订的战争赔偿协定。
    这些贸易公司都是日越贸易会的会员。它们还打电报给越南民主共和国政府，表示反对这个战争赔偿协定。
    这个协会还决定积极参加预定18日在东京举行的改善日本同中国、苏联、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的关系的国民大会。
