Beijing

　　This newspaper reports that after completing the April industrial production plan three and a half days ahead of schedule with a 9.8% overfulfillment, the capital's workers are actively launching a massive production increase and economy drive movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation.

　　In the twenty-nine days of April, the total value of the city's output was equivalent to 238.3% of April last year. Among the thirty-six major products, twenty-six, including steel, iron, steel products, electricity, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and grain combine harvesters, completed their plans. Coal production also completed its plan.

　　In April, city and district-level organizations universally organized competitions within the same industry and same type of work. This inter-factory competition played a role in mutual encouragement, experience exchange, and mutual assistance. Xinzhong Steel Plant learned from the experience of Xuanwu Steel Plant's No. 7 blast furnace, doubled its blast furnace output, and completed its April plan half a month ahead of schedule.

　　The biggest feature of the competition is that while focusing on output, it also focuses on quality; while focusing on output value, it also focuses on variety; while focusing on increasing production, it also focuses on economy. Due to attention to strengthening production management, especially tightly grasping the implementation of some necessary rules and regulations, in April, in addition to overfulfilling the output value plan, the product quality of many factories also generally improved. Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill's first-class cotton cloth rate reached 93.67% in April, an increase of 6% from the previous month, and the first-class cotton yarn rate reached 94.53%, an increase of 2.8% from the previous month.

　　In the Red Flag competition, the district and municipal-level leading organs dispatched inspection teams to focus on checking the plan's completion, summarizing advanced experiences, and solving problems. Some cadres in the Chaoyang District Cotton Blanket Factory lacked confidence in completing the April plan at the beginning of the month. After inspection by the Chaoyang District Committee inspection team, they helped them solve key problems such as long production cycles and disconnected production. The cadres' confidence was enhanced, and they increased the output value by 60,000 yuan, and as a result, they also completed the plan.

　　The achievements in April were great, but some major products did not complete the state plan, and some factories paid attention to increasing production, but did not grasp the work of economy tightly enough. On a city-wide scale, the development of the movement is still very uneven. The capital's workers, who have successfully completed the April production plan, are actively carrying out a vigorous production increase and economy drive movement to further deepen the Three High Red Flag competition and are determined to create greater achievements in Red May.

Wuhan

　　This newspaper reports from Wuhan on the 2nd that over one thousand advanced producer representatives from Wuhan resolutely implement the resolutions of the National People's Congress, carry out a production increase and economy drive movement, and strive to "fight the great battle of Red May to achieve a decisive victory in completing the second quarter plan, and fight for five months to greet the tenth anniversary of National Day with new achievements."

　　In the first quarter, Wuhan launched a vigorous production increase and economy drive movement centered on technological revolution, and the total industrial output value increased by nearly double compared to the same period last year. A total of four hundred and eighty-seven advanced units and five hundred and seventy-four advanced producers emerged.

　　At a recent meeting of advanced producer representatives, advanced standard bearers Ma Xueli, You Wenxiang, Shi Boxun, Hu Tingdong, Kang Jiakun, Zhu Zaodi, Huang Leting, Han Wendi and others jointly proposed to the city's workers that they ensure ideological red flags, continuously engage in innovation, improve labor productivity, and that one person is as good as one and a half to two people. To achieve the above requirements, they also proposed that in production, they should use their brains everywhere, engage in innovation in everything, so that old equipment can "rejuvenate" and new equipment can be "the icing on the cake"; actively assist leaders in doing a good job in scientific management, and exemplarily abide by labor discipline; overcome difficulties in every possible way, increase production, and save raw materials; bring good apprentices, quickly train technicians, strictly abide by safety regulations and quality standards; and strengthen communist large-scale collaboration, among other seven measures.

　　These proposals received a warm response from the city's workers.

Henan

　　This newspaper reports that the advanced collectives and advanced producers of Henan Province's industry, construction, transportation, and postal and telecommunications industries have issued a proposal to the province's industrial workers to "launch a production increase and economy drive movement centered on technological revolution and aimed at improving labor productivity."

　　The proposal pointed out that the 1959 national economic plan (draft) announced by the Second National People's Congress is a magnificent plan. The industrial construction plan formulated by Henan Province in accordance with the national plan is also a leap forward plan. The objective conditions for realizing this plan are fully available. The current central task is to fully exert people's subjective initiative.

　　The proposal also mentioned that the central link of the production increase and economy drive movement is to improve labor productivity, increase production, practice strict economy, and oppose waste. This requires everyone to vigorously engage in technological revolution, try every possible means to improve tools and improve equipment, improve design and technology, save raw materials, improve equipment utilization, improve labor organization, and save manpower, materials, and financial resources to the greatest extent.

　　Currently, Henan Province's production increase and economy drive movement is being rolled out in a planned and comprehensive manner.

Guangxi

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 1st. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region recently convened the Second Representative Conference of Advanced Producers and New Worker Activists in Industry and Transportation. More than 1,500 representatives attending the meeting unanimously stated that they would take the lead in responding to and implementing the call of the National People's Congress with their exemplary actions, promote a production increase and economy drive movement among the workers of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region, and ensure better completion of this year's industrial production and construction tasks.

　　Many typical experiences introduced at the meeting showed that Guangxi's industrial and transportation enterprises still have great potential to tap in terms of manpower, equipment, raw materials, and materials.

　　At the meeting, all the representatives made the following proposal to the workers of all ethnic groups in the region: immediately launch a vigorous production increase and economy drive movement, everyone should use their brains, everyone should offer ideas, and strive to increase the annual labor productivity by 50%.

    大战红五月　迎接国庆节
    北京武汉等地增产节约大竞赛
    北京
    本报讯　首都工人提前三天半超额9.8％完成了4月份工业生产计划以后，正积极展开一个以技术革命和技术革新为中心的，声势浩大的增产节约运动。
    在四月份二十九天中全市完成的总产值相当于去年4月份的238.3％，三十六种主要产品中，钢、铁、钢材、电力、水泥、棉纱、棉布、谷物联合收割机等二十六种都完成了计划，煤的产量计划也完成了。
    四月份，全市按市、区范围普遍组织了同产业、同工种竞赛。这种厂际竞赛起了一种互相鼓舞、交流经验、互相帮助的作用。新中钢铁厂学习宣武钢铁厂七号高炉的经验，高炉产量提高了一倍，提前半个月完成了4月份计划。
    竞赛中的最大特点是：在抓产量的同时抓质量，抓产值的同时抓品种，抓增产的同时抓节约。由于注意加强了生产管理，特别抓紧贯彻了一些必要的规章制度，在4月份除了产值计划超额完成以外，许多厂的产品质量也普遍有了提高。京棉一厂4月份棉布下机一等品率达到93.67％，比上月又提高6％，棉纱上等一级品率达到94.53％，比上月又提高2.8％。
    在红旗竞赛中，市区级领导机关分别派出了检查组，有重点地检查计划完成情况，总结先进经验，解决问题。朝阳区棉毯厂有些干部，在月初对完成4月计划信心不足，经朝阳区委检查组检查，帮助他们解决了生产周期长，生产不衔接等关键问题，干部信心增强了，又把产值提高了六万元，结果也完成了。
    4月份成绩很大，但有的主要产品没有完成国家计划，有的工厂注意了增产，但对节约工作抓得还不够紧，在全市范围内来说，目前运动发展还很不平衡，胜利完成了4月份生产计划的首都工人，正在积极开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，使三高红旗竞赛进一步深入，决心在红五月中创造更大成绩。
    武汉
    本报武汉2日电  武汉市一千多名先进生产者代表全市职工坚决贯彻全国人民代表大会的决议，开展增产节约运动，做到“大战红5月，取得完成第二季度计划的决定性的胜利，大战五个月用新成绩迎接国庆十周年”。
    武汉市第一季度开展了蓬蓬勃勃的以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，工业总产值比去年同期增长了将近一倍。共涌现出了四百八十七个先进单位和五百七十四个先进生产者。
    在最近一次先进生产者代表会上，先进旗手马学礼、由文祥、石伯勋、胡廷栋、康家坤、朱早弟、黄乐庭、韩文第等八人联合向全市职工提出倡议，保证思想插红旗，不断搞革新，提高劳动生产率，一个人顶一个半到两个人。为了达到上述要求，他们并提出在生产中，处处动脑筋、事事搞革新，叫旧设备“返老还童，新设备锦上添花”；积极协助领导搞好科学管理，模范地遵守劳动纪律；千方百计克服困难，增加生产，节约原材料；带好徒弟，快速培养技工、严格遵守安全规程和质量标准；加强共产主义大协作等七项措施。
    这些倡议得到全市职工的热烈响应。
    河南
    本报讯　河南省工业、基建、交通、邮电先进集体和先进生产者全体代表向全省各产业职工发出了“开展以技术革命为中心的、以提高劳动生产率为目标的增产节约运动”的倡议。
    倡议书指出：二届全国人民代表大会首次会议公布的1959年国民经济计划（草案）是一个宏伟的计划。河南省根据国家计划所制定的工业建设计划，也是一个跃进的计划。实现这个计划的客观条件已经完全具备。当前的中心任务，就是充分发挥人的主观能动性。
    倡议书还提到，增产节约运动的中心环节是提高劳动生产率，增加生产，厉行节约，反对浪费。这就要求大家大闹技术革命，千方百计地改良工具和改善设备，改进设计和工艺，节约原材料，提高设备利用率，改善劳动组织，最大限度地节约人力、物力、财力。
    目前河南省的增产节约运动，正在有计划地全面铺开。
    广西
    据新华社南宁1日电　广西僮族自治区最近召开了第二次工业、交通运输业先进生产者和新工人积极分子代表会议。参加会议的一千五百多名代表一致表示，要以自己的模范行动带头响应贯彻全国人民代表大会的号召，推动全自治区各族职工掀起一个增产节约运动，保证更好地完成今年的工业生产和建设任务。
    会上介绍的许多典型经验表明，目前广西工业和交通企业，无论在人力、设备，还是原料和材料方面，都还有很大的潜力好挖。
    会上，全体代表向全区各族职工提出了以下的倡议：立即掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，人人动脑筋，个个献计谋，力争把全年劳动生产率提高50％。
