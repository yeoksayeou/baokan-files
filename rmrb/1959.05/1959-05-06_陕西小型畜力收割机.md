One of the several harvesting machines recommended by the National Wheat Harvester Evaluation Symposium.

At the National Human and Animal-Powered Wheat Harvester Evaluation and Experiment Experience Exchange Symposium, the Shaanxi small animal-powered harvester was considered relatively good among the machines participating in the evaluation. It was also a popular harvester at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition last year. Currently, 3,000 units have been promoted in Shaanxi Province; after production experiments and feedback from the masses, further improvements have been made this year.

This small animal-powered harvester is converted from the frame of a double-furrow plow and certain parts of an animal-powered double-row cotton planter. The front support rod is fixed on the front crossbeam of the frame, and the rear support rod is fixed on the rear end of the right beam, both hinged to the harvesting platform with a cotter pin. The right end of the front cutter bar of the harvesting platform is biased forward by three degrees. Iron wire with a diameter of three to five millimeters is wrapped around the outer edge of the ground wheel to prevent slippage, with a spacing of five to seven millimeters between each turn, which should not be too small. In addition, a manual jackscrew clutch has been added, which can stop the movement of the cutter and wooden turning wheel when transporting without cutting wheat.

The specifications of the harvester are as follows:

　　Working Width　70 cm
　　Total Weight of Machine　122 kg
　　Overall Dimensions　Length 200 cm  Width 146 cm  Height 185 cm
　　Cutter Stroke　7.62 cm
　　Number of Blades　10 Fixed Blades  9 Moving Blades
　　Dividers　2
　　Transmission Speed Ratio　1∶16.8
　　Spur Gear Teeth　60, 13　Module 5
　　Bevel Gear Teeth　40, 11　Module 4
　　Wooden Turning Wheel Diameter　124 cm
　　Number of Wooden Turning Wheel Spokes　5
　　Ground Wheel Diameter　55 cm

The cost of this harvester is 70 to 80 yuan. It is operated by two to three people (including stacking), pulled by one animal, and can harvest 20 to 40 mu per day. It can adapt to wheat stalk heights of 60-140 cm, and the pulling force is 50 kg.

After testing, its advantages are: (1) compact structure, uses less steel, reasonable combination of iron and wood, and low cost; (2) fully utilizes double-furrow plows and cotton planters, requires very few additional parts, and can still restore the original state of the double-furrow plow and cotton planter; (3) good harvesting quality, without missed cutting or tearing; (4) reasonable transmission method, and good selection of cutting speed; (5) the wooden turning wheel is simple to adjust, has a large adjustment range, and can adapt to different wheat heights.

However, it also has the following shortcomings: (1) when harvesting densely planted wheat, the cutter is prone to clogging; (2) the machine's force is uneven, the operation is laborious, and the flatness of the terrain is highly required; (3) the no-load resistance is large, accounting for 61% of the total pulling force, and actual cutting only uses 39% of the pulling force; (4) the slip rate is high, reaching 19.2%, and the machine's efficiency is not fully utilized; (5) disorderly stacking and difficulty in turning. These shortcomings still need to be carefully studied and overcome in actual application.

　　陕西小型畜力收割机
    全国小麦收割机评选座谈会推荐的几种收割机具之一
    全国人畜力小麦收割机评选试验经验交流座谈会上，认为陕西小型畜力收割机在这次参加评选的机具中是较好的。去年在全国农具展览会中，它也是一台受群众欢迎的收割机。现在陕西省已推广了三千部；经过生产试验及群众反映，今年又作了进一步的改进。
    这台小型畜力收割机是用双铧犁的机架和畜力双行棉播机的某些零件改装成的。在机架前横梁上固定前撑杆，右梁后端固定后撑杆，都以活肖与收割台绞接。收割台前定刀梁右端偏前三度。在地轮外沿缠绕直径为三至五公厘的铁丝，以免打滑，每圈间距为五至七公厘，不宜过小。另外增加了手动顶丝离合器，可在不割麦只运输的时候使割刀和木翻轮停止运动。
    收割机的规格如下：
    工作宽度　70公分
    机身总重　122公斤
    外形尺寸　长200公分  宽146公分  高185公分
    割刀行程　7.62公分
    刀片数目　固定刀片10个  活动刀片9个
    压刃器　2个
    传动速度比率　1∶16.8
    直齿轮齿数　60，13　模数5
    锥齿轮齿数　40，11　模数4
    木翻轮直径　124公分
    木翻轮辐条数　5
    地轮直径　55公分
    这台收割机的造价为七十至八十元，由二至三人操纵（包括收堆），一畜牵引，每日可收割二十至四十亩，可适应的麦秆高度为60—140公分，牵引力为五十公斤。
    经过试验，它的优点有：（1）结构紧凑，用钢铁少，铁木配合适当，成本较低；（2）充分利用了双铧犁和棉播机，添置零件很少，并且仍能恢复双铧犁及棉播机的原状；（3）收割质量较好，没有漏割、撕裂现象；（4）传动方式合理，选择切割速度较好；（5）木翻轮调整简单，调节范围大，能适应不同的麦子高度。
    但是，它还存在着以下缺点：（1）收割密植小麦时，割刀容易堵塞；（2）机器受力不均衡，操作费力，对地形的平整程度要求较高；（3）空行阻力大，占总拉力的61％，实际切割只用拉力的39％；（4）打滑率高，达19.2％，机器效能未能全部发挥；（5）收堆紊乱，转弯困难。这些缺点尚待在实际运用中注意研究，加以克服。
