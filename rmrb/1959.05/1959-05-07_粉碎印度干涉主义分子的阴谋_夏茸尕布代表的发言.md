　　Smash the Conspiracy of Indian Interventionist Elements
　　Speech by Xiarong Gabu
　　I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and Vice Chairman Peng. These reports comprehensively summarize the tremendous achievements and experiences of our country's socialist construction and put forward the grand task of continuing the Great Leap Forward for the people of the whole country this year. This meeting will undoubtedly further mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, and encourage the people of the whole country to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the various tasks for 1959.

　　Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, people of all ethnic groups throughout the country have achieved extremely significant victories on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. People's material and cultural lives have greatly improved, their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes, the unity of the motherland has been further consolidated, and the unity of all ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly strengthened. All of this fully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

　　Imperialist elements and Tibetan reactionary forces completely misjudged the situation
　　Our victory is the enemy's defeat, and the enemy is always unwilling to accept their defeat. They will try every possible means to sabotage our unity and peaceful construction. The recent armed rebellion in Tibet is a vivid example. The former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique, in violation of the interests of all ethnic groups in the country, colluded with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, gathered rebel bandits, launched a rebellion, and kidnapped the Dalai Lama to India, attempting to split the motherland, undermine national unity, and once again place the Tibetan people under the slavery of imperialism, permanently preserving their most backward, darkest, and most cruel serf system. However, imperialist elements and Tibetan reactionary forces completely misjudged the situation. Contrary to their wishes, the rebellion they launched in Tibet was immediately met with resolute opposition from all ethnic groups in the country, including the Tibetan people. The troops of the Tibet Military Region resolutely implemented the State Council's orders. With the active support of the broad masses of monks, nuns, and laypeople in Tibet, they quickly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area, causing the rebel bandits to suffer a shameful defeat in a short period of time. This further promoted the unity of the motherland, accelerated the demise of the Tibetan reactionary forces, and promoted the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people.

　　The so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials on April 18th is completely distorted, fabricated out of thin air, and has ulterior motives. Its content has nothing in common with the Dalai Lama's usual words and deeds, or with the three handwritten letters the Dalai Lama wrote to Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet. At the same time, the tone of the statement is completely unlike the Dalai Lama's voice and does not resemble Tibetan writing at all. Therefore, we suspect that this statement did not originate from the Dalai Lama's intentions, let alone from the Dalai Lama's hand, but was imposed on the Dalai Lama by the rebel bandits under the direction of imperialists and foreign reactionaries. I express my great indignation and resolute opposition to this.

　　The actions of some politicians in India are not friendly enough
　　It is not surprising that imperialism is using the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble. What is strange is that certain politicians in our neighboring country of India have shown great enthusiasm for this both before and after the Tibetan rebellion. Moreover, many expansionist elements' clamors for interfering in China's internal affairs and slanders against China have appeared extensively in Indian newspapers and in the discussions and statements of some Indian politicians. On April 18th, the absurd document of the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" was even distributed by Indian officials. From this series of facts, it can be seen that the expansionist elements in India simply want to turn Tibet into their colony and protectorate. Here we cannot help but ask: as Indian politicians, who are joint initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, not only do not question the above-mentioned series of activities that undermine Sino-Indian friendship, but even "chime in" and give support. Is this being a friend? Does it conform to Prime Minister Nehru's statement that political activities against another country are not allowed in India? Does it conform to the interests of friendly relations between China and India? Obviously, all of this is unanswerable, and therefore extremely inglorious.

　　The statement initially trumpets the so-called "independence" of Tibetans. Everyone knows that Tibet has always been a part of Chinese territory. This is not only because Tibet has had close political, economic, and cultural ties with the mainland since a very early time, but also because Tibet officially joined the territory of China in the 13th century. Even the title, status, and functions of the Dalai Lama were stipulated separately by emperors of several dynasties in the mainland. Taking Tibet's "unity of politics and religion" as an example, it began after Kublai Khan, the Yuan Dynasty Emperor, enfeoffed Pagpa Lama as the Great Treasure Dharma King in 1251, giving him great power. The Ming Dynasty also granted titles to the Great Lamas of Tibet. In the early 15th century, Tsongkhapa founded the Gelug school, which was promoted and propagated by his "reincarnated" disciples and descendants, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. The Third Dalai Lama was enfeoffed by Altan Khan during the Ming Dynasty in Wanli's reign, with the title of Omniscient Vajradhara Dalai Lama, and it was then that the title of Dalai Lama came into being. In 1652, the Fifth Dalai Lama personally came to Beijing and was enfeoffed by the Qing Dynasty government as the "Western Great Benevolent Self-Sufficient Buddha Leading All Buddhist Teachings Under Heaven, Universal Fan Chi Ratna Dalai Lama," and so on. All of this eloquently proves that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, which is beyond doubt. As for the fallacy that Tibetans are different from Han Chinese and therefore must be "independent," it is simply not worth refuting. If this reasoning were applied to multi-ethnic India, then India would have to form countless countries.

　　It is those rebellious elements in cassocks who are destroying religion
　　The statement says that religion has been destroyed in Tibet. I am a religious practitioner, and I have been living with the Communist Party for ten years since liberation. It has been my personal experience that all religious beliefs are free and have been protected by the government. From a political perspective, the Buddhist Association of China has been established, and religious personnel enjoy equal rights. The Dalai Lama was also elected as the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Panchen Lama was elected as the Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and other patriotic religious personnel have also been given appropriate positions. None of this existed or was possible during the reactionary rule. From an economic point of view, the state has helped us repair monasteries, sutra halls, and almsgiving continues as before. The state takes such care of religion and protects religion, but it is still said that freedom of religious belief is not free, and has even been destroyed. Are the activities of those rebellious elements who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and undermine unity, freedom of religious belief? Obviously, it is these poisonous snakes in cassocks—a small group of rebellious elements—who are destroying religion and demolishing religion.

　　What the rebellious elements want is not "autonomy," but to sell out Tibet's "independence"
　　The statement also says that since the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, "the Tibetan government has not enjoyed any degree of autonomy," and even the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region "has no power." Now it is very clear that what the reactionary elements call "autonomy" is Tibet's independence. This is resolutely opposed by all ethnic groups in the country and will never be possible. Everyone knows that since the liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government has given great assistance to Tibet in economic and cultural construction undertakings, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in April 1956. This should be said to be a major event in the history of Tibet. I have personally experienced that the only purpose of the Communist Party in leading the people of minority areas to establish local autonomous governments is to help the people of minority nationalities be masters of their own affairs, manage the internal affairs of their own nationalities, and develop the economic and cultural undertakings of their own nationalities, so that all ethnic areas can transition to socialist society. As I said before, I am a religious practitioner and the head of the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The Party is very concerned about me, and not only do I have the power and authority to preside over the work of the Prefectural People's Committee, but I am also invited to attend some important meetings held by the Haibei Prefectural Committee of the CPC. This is the greatest encouragement and trust for me. It is difficult to believe that Qinghai and Tibet are both territories of China, and both are under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, and both are implementing the Party's ethnic policy. Why do we feel that we have power and authority, while the reactionary group in Tibet feels that they have no power? It turns out that the "power" they need is the independence of Tibet, and the delusion of continuing to maintain their most backward and cruel serf system.

　　It is worth mentioning here that in order to make Tibet a new democratic and socialist Tibet as soon as possible, and to vigorously develop production and improve the lives of the Tibetan people, the Tibetan people must build on the victory of quelling the rebellion and continue to work hard to gradually carry out democratic reforms in the Tibetan region. This is the Party's established policy and was stipulated in the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. From the reform situation in Haibei Autonomous Prefecture, it can be seen that democratic reform is the urgent demand of the Tibetan people. Whoever violates this demand of the people will be opposed by the people and even overthrown by the people. Therefore, we religious circles and all patriotic people must actively participate in the work of democratic reform and do our best to ensure the smooth progress of democratic reform.

　　We firmly believe that the reborn Tibetan people will, from now on, unite more closely with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, rally around the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and strive to resolutely oppose imperialist aggression and the ambitions of Indian expansionist elements, for the unity of the motherland, for the further unity of all ethnic groups, and for the early entry of the Tibetan nationality into the ranks of advanced socialist nationalities.

　　粉碎印度干涉主义分子的阴谋
    夏茸尕布代表的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理及彭副委员长的报告。这些报告，全面地总结了我国社会主义建设的巨大成就和经验，提出了全国人民今年继续大跃进的宏伟任务。这次会议，无疑将进一步调动各方面的积极性，加强各民族的团结，鼓舞全国人民为完成和超额完成一九五九年各项任务而努力奋斗。
  解放以来，全国各族人民在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下，不论在经济战线上、政治战线上和思想战线上都获得了极其重大的胜利，人们的物质、文化生活有了很大的提高，精神面貌有了巨大的变化，祖国的统一更加巩固了，各族人民的团结空前加强了，这一切都充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    帝国主义分子和西藏反动势力把形势完全估计错了
    我们的胜利，就是敌人的失败，而敌人对自己的失败总是不甘心的，他们时刻会千方百计地设法对我们的团结与和平建设进行破坏。最近西藏地方发生的武装叛乱，就是一个鲜明的例证。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，违背全国各族人民利益，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，纠集叛匪，进行叛乱，并将达赖喇嘛劫往印度，企图分裂祖国，破坏民族团结，把西藏人民重新置于帝国主义的奴役之下，永远保存其最落后、最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度。但是帝国主义分子和西藏反动势力把形势完全估计错了。同他们的愿望相反，他们在西藏发动的叛乱，立即遭到了全国各族人民、包括西藏人民在内的坚决反对。西藏军区部队坚决执行了国务院的命令，他们在西藏广大僧俗人民的积极支持下，迅速平息了拉萨地区的叛乱，使叛乱分子在短暂的时间里遭到了可耻的失败。从而更加促进了祖国的统一，加速了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。
    四月十八日经由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这个声明完全是歪曲事实、无中生有、别有用心的。其内容无论同达赖喇嘛平时的言行、或者是同达赖喇嘛给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三的三封亲笔信来看，都是毫无共同之处的。同时，声明的语气，也完全不是达赖喇嘛的口吻，也根本不像西藏的文体。因此，我们怀疑，这个声明并非出于达赖喇嘛之意，更非出于达赖喇嘛之手，而是叛乱分子在帝国主义和外国反动派的指使下，强加于达赖喇嘛的。对此，我表示极大的愤慨和坚决的反对。
    印度的某些政治家的所作所为，不够朋友
    帝国主义利用西藏叛乱兴风作浪，这是不足为奇的，奇怪的是，在这次西藏叛乱前后，我们邻邦印度的某些政治家对此却表示了极大的热心，而且扩张主义分子的许多干涉中国内政的叫嚷和对中国的诬蔑，竟然大量见诸印度的报刊，出诸某些印度政治家的议论和声明中。四月十八日更由印度官员散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”这样荒谬绝伦的文件。从这一系列的事实中可以看出，印度的扩张主义分子简直要把西藏变为他们的殖民地和保护国了。这里我们不禁要问：作为和平共处五项原则共同倡导者的印度政治家，对上述一系列破坏中印友好的活动不仅不加过问，甚至“帮腔助威”给以支持，这难道够朋友吗？合乎尼赫鲁总理关于不允许在印度进行反对另一个国家的政治活动的说法吗？符合中印两国友好关系的利益吗？显然，这一切都是无法回答的，因而也是极不光彩的。
    声明中一开始，就鼓吹所谓西藏人的“独立”。谁都知道，西藏从来就是中国领土的一部分，这不仅因为很早以来，西藏就和祖国内地发生了政治、经济和文化上的密切联系，到了十三世纪时，西藏就正式加入了中国的版图，即是达赖喇嘛的称号、地位和职权，也都是内地几朝皇帝分别规定的。以西藏的“政教合一”来说，它就是由公元一千二百五十一年元世祖封帕恩巴喇嘛为大宝法王给他掌管大权之后开始的。明代对西藏的大喇嘛也曾各给予封号。十五世纪初叶，宗喀巴创立黄教，由其“转世”弟子后辈的达赖和班禅宣传宏扬。第三世达赖就曾在明万历年间受蒙古俺达可汉之封为一切智执金刚达赖喇嘛，这才有了达赖喇嘛的称号。到一六五二年，第五世达赖亲自来到北京，又由清朝政府册封为“西天大善自在佛所领天下释教普通凡赤喇怛喇达赖喇嘛”等等。这一切都雄辩地说明了西藏是中国领土的一部分，是丝毫不容置疑的。至于说西藏人和汉人不同，因而必须“独立”的谬论，简直是不值一驳的。如果这个道理用于多民族的印度，那么印度就不知要成立多少个国家了。
    摧毁宗教的正是那些披着袈裟的叛乱分子
    声明中说，宗教在西藏受到了破坏。我是一个宗教职业者，解放后与共产党相处十年了，使我亲身体会到，各种宗教信仰都是自由的，并且都得到了政府的保护。从政治方面来讲，全国成立了佛教协会，宗教人员一律享有平等权利，达赖还被选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，班禅被选为全国政协副主席，其他爱国的宗教人员也都有了适当的职位。这在反动统治时期都是没有的，也是不可能有的。从经济上来讲，国家帮助我们修补寺院、经堂、化布施也仍然照旧等。国家这样照顾宗教、保护宗教，仍然说宗教信仰不自由，甚至受到了破坏，难道那些勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、破坏统一的叛乱分子，所进行的活动就是信教自由吗？显然，破坏宗教、摧毁宗教的是这些披着袈裟的毒蛇——一小撮叛乱分子。
    叛乱分子所要的不是“自治”，而是出卖西藏的“独立”
    声明中还说，自从解放军进驻西藏后“西藏政府没有享受任何程度的自治”，甚至自治区筹备委员会“也没有什么权力”。现在看的很清楚，反动分子所谓的“自治”，就是西藏的独立。这是全国各族人民都坚决反对的，是永远不可能实现的。谁都知道，自从西藏解放后，中央人民政府对西藏在经济、文化各项建设事业中给与了大力的帮助，并且在一九五六年四月成立了西藏自治区筹委会，这应该说是西藏有史以来的一件大事。我亲身体会到，共产党领导少数民族地区的人民成立地方自治政府，唯一的目的是为了帮助少数民族人民当家作主，管理自己民族内部的事务，发展自己民族的经济、文化事业，使各民族地区都能过渡到社会主义社会。前面讲过，我是个宗教职业者，又是海北藏族自治州州长，党对我非常关怀，不但有职有权地主持着州人委的工作，而且中共海北州委召开的一些重要会议，还叫我参加，这对我是一种最大的鼓舞和信任。很难使人相信，青海、西藏同是中国的领土，也都在中国共产党、毛主席和人民政府领导下，同是执行着党的民族政策，为什么我们感到有职有权，西藏的反动集团却感到没有什么权力呢？原来他们所需要的“权力”是西藏的独立，是妄想继续维持其最落后最残酷的农奴制度。
    这里值得提起的是，为了使西藏早日成为民主的社会主义的新西藏，达到大力发展生产，改善西藏人民生活，西藏人民必须在平息叛乱胜利的基础上再接再励，逐步进行西藏地区的民主改革。这是党的既定政策，也是解放西藏十七条协议中早作了规定的。从海北自治州的改革情况可以看出，民主改革是藏族人民的迫切要求，谁要违背人民这一要求，便要遭到人民反对，甚至被人民打倒。因此，我们宗教界和一切爱国人士都必须积极参加民主改革工作，尽最大的努力保证民主改革的顺利进行。
    我们坚信，得到了新生的西藏人民，今后一定会和全国各族人民一道，更加紧密地团结在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为坚决反对帝国主义的侵略和印度扩张主义分子的野心，为祖国统一，为各民族的进一步团结和使西藏民族及早进入先进的社会主义民族的行列而努力奋斗。
