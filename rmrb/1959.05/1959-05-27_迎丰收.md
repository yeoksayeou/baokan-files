    Welcoming the Harvest
    By our correspondent Han Guozhen
    In mid-May, in the cool morning air, Chen Bangzheng, a 76-year-old member of the Shageng Brigade of the Qianzhen Commune in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, went to the wheat field alone again. In a large expanse of yellow-green wheat fields, the wheat ears swayed in the morning breeze. Chen Bangzheng lovingly held the ears of wheat and silently counted the grains. This old man had not been able to work in the fields for several years, but for the past half month, as the wheat in the fields gradually ripened, he went to the wheat fields almost every day. He had long been pondering in his heart: "It's not easy to bring so much wheat into the barn! If I can cut a handful, I'll harvest a handful faster. I can't let a single grain of the food at hand be lost!" Recently, the old man had been tidying up his sickle at home, preparing to participate in the upcoming summer harvest battle.
    As early as April 26, the Qianzhen Commune held a meeting to prepare for the wheat harvest, and the entire commune had been working day and night to arrange a plan for a bumper harvest. For example, the Shageng Brigade had already calculated the labor force account, and rationally arranged the labor force according to the characteristics of this year's large wheat area and small labor force. The cadres also accepted the opinions of the commune members and decided to build threshing grounds in the fields and set up threshing ground sheds, so as to achieve simultaneous yellowing, cutting, harvesting, and threshing. These days, the commune members of the Shageng Brigade seem particularly excited, some are busy tidying up their sickles, and some are busy clearing out their houses. Zhu Zhawen of the Xiyao team took the initiative to vacate a large room in his house, cleaned it thoroughly, and said, "After a year of hard work, the wheat must be brought into the barn as soon as possible!" Grandma Liu, who is over sixty years old, heard that the team was going to build a threshing ground, and she decided to lend the wood from her two houses that were not needed for the time being to the team to build the threshing ground shed, and personally carried the wood to the field threshing ground. On the evening of the 18th, the members of the six production teams of the Chongxin Production Team, after transporting fertilizer during the day, had dinner, and then automatically took advantage of the moonlight, some carrying large shovels, some carrying wood from their own houses, and rushed to make the threshing ground. That night, they made nine acres of threshing ground and built ten sheds.
    The Wuli Brigade, which has the largest wheat area and the best growth in the entire commune, is also determined to win an outstanding victory in the wheat harvest battle. In early May, the entire brigade formed harvesting groups, threshing groups, and storage groups. Each production team and group has vacated rooms and cleaned them thoroughly to serve as warehouses for storing wheat. The Wuli Production Team also carefully arranged all 378 mu of wheat fields in the team into three categories, and prepared to use different manpower to harvest different wheat fields. The most active seems to be the deputy captain Wang Shouzhi. This female captain, who is only nineteen years old, is both happy and worried to see that this year's wheat area in the commune is large, the rows are dense, and the wheat ears are long. What she likes is that the wheat will have a bumper harvest, and what she worries about is how to bring so much wheat home. On May 17, she specially convened a meeting of more than 80 women in the team to discuss this year's wheat harvest tasks. At the meeting, she organized the young ones to cut wheat, the strong ones to carry wheat, and the old ones to watch the threshing ground. Sixteen-year-old Hu Yufeng said: "There is so much wheat this year, I'm afraid there won't be enough tools. We should bring more tools from home, and not just rely on the team to buy them!" Her suggestion was immediately agreed by everyone. That night, dozens of women took advantage of the moonlight to tidy up their sickles and prepare their utensils. The next day, when Wang Shouzhi came to inspect, each of them had prepared a complete set of tools.
    In the days of welcoming the harvest, the workers in the commune machinery factory seem even busier. Since the commune Party committee assigned them the task of rushing to make summer harvest tools in April, the workers have manufactured and repaired more than 5,000 sickles and other tools for the commune. Secretary Hu Yufa and Factory Director Shu Guangming have been working with technicians Fu Xianjin, Wang Chao Gui, Zhang Daohai, and others to trial-produce a "five-knife rotary harvester" these days. They said, this year's wheat area is large and grows densely, how can we not manufacture harvesters! In order to trial-produce this harvester, they worked continuously for three days and finally made the harvester. After testing, this newly made harvester can be operated by two people to cut 15 to 20 mu per day, increasing work efficiency by more than 15 times.
    At present, more than 16,000 mu of wheat in the Qianzhen Commune are about to ripen, and all preparations for the summer harvest of the entire commune have been completed. The commune members are full of joy to welcome the first summer bumper harvest after communization.

    迎丰收
    本报记者  韩国珍
    5月中旬的清晨，还有着丝丝的凉意，安徽省舒城县乾镇公社沙埂大队七十六岁的老社员陈帮正，又独自来到麦地里了。在一大片黄绿色的麦地里，麦穗正随着晨风摇曳着。陈帮正爱不释手地捧着穗头，默默地数着麦粒。这老人已经好几年没能下地干活了，可是这半个月来，随着地里麦子的逐渐成熟，他几乎每天都要到麦地里转几遭。他心里早就在捉摸着：“这么多的麦子要收归仓，可不是容易的事啊！我能割一把，也就快收了一把，不能让到手的粮食损失一粒！”近来，这老人已在家里收拾镰刀，准备参加即将到来的夏收之战了。
    乾镇公社早在4月26日就召开了麦收准备工作的会议，全社已日夜突击安排好丰收的计划。如沙埂大队已算过了劳力账，根据今年麦地的面积大、劳动力少的特点，合理安排了劳动力。干部还接受了社员的意见决定在地里做场基，搭场地棚，以便做到边黄、边割，边收、边打。这几天，沙埂大队的社员们显得格外兴奋，有的忙着收拾镰刀，有的忙着腾房子。西窑组的朱扎文主动腾出家里的一间大屋子，打扫得干干净净的，他说：“忙了一年，麦子一定要趁早收归仓！”六十多岁的刘老奶奶听说队里要做场基，她决定把暂时用不着的两间房子的木料借给组里搭场基棚，并亲自扛着木料送到田里场地上去。18日这天晚上，重信生产队的六个生产组的社员，白天刚运完肥，吃罢晚饭，又自动地趁着月色，有的扛着大锹，有的从自家屋里扛来了木料，突击做场基。这天晚上，他们便做了九亩地的场基，搭了十间棚。
    全社麦子面积最大、生长最好的伍里大队也下决心要在麦收战斗中打一个出色的胜仗。5月上旬，全大队便组成了收割组、脱粒组、保管组，每个生产队、组，都已腾出了房间，打扫得干干净净，作为堆放麦子的仓库。伍里生产队还细致地把全队三百七十八亩小麦田排了队，分成三类，准备用不同的人力收割不同的麦地。显得特别活跃的要算副队长王守芝了，这个才十九岁的女队长，看到今年社里麦子面积大、行棵密、麦穗长，真是又喜欢又担心，喜欢的是麦子获得大丰收，担心的是怎样把这么多的麦子收到家。5月17日她专门召集了全队八十多个妇女开会，讨论了今年麦收的任务。会上并组织年纪轻的割麦子，身体壮的挑麦子，年纪大的看场地。十六岁的胡玉凤说：“今年麦子这么多，工具怕不够用了，我们要多从家里带工具，不要光靠队里买！”她的建议立刻得到大家的同意。这天晚上，几十个妇女趁着月亮收拾镰刀，准备用具，第二天王守芝来检查时，她们每个人都已将整套的工具准备齐全了。
    在迎接丰收的日子里，公社机械厂里的职工们显得更加忙碌。自从4月份社党委将赶制夏收工具的任务交给他们后，工人们已经为公社制造和修配了五千多把镰刀和其他各种工具。支书胡雨发和厂长舒光明这些天来，一直和技工傅先进、汪朝贵、张道海等试制着“五刀转盘收割机”，他们说，今年麦子面积大，长得密，不制造收割机怎能行！为了试制这架收割机，他们连续干了三天，终于把收割机制成了。经过试验，这新制的收割机二人操作一天可割十五亩到二十亩，提高工效十五倍以上。
    目前，乾镇公社一万六千多亩麦子即将黄熟，全社夏收的各项准备工作已经就绪，社员们正满怀喜悦迎接公社化后第一个夏季大丰收。
