Comrades, Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

　　I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I also resolutely support the Central People's Government's policy and measures for thoroughly quelling the rebellion in Tibet.

    The Armed Rebellion in Tibet Has Been Quelled

　　Tibet has always been our country's sacred territory. The armed rebellion of Tibetan reactionaries and the quelling of the rebellion in Tibet are entirely our own country's affairs, and no foreign country can interfere. Of course, we could have anticipated that imperialists, who have always been enemies of the Chinese people, would take the opportunity to stir up trouble. However, it is regrettable that in our great neighbor, India, some newspapers have openly made slanderous accusations against our country, and the discussions and statements of certain politicians have actually given "sympathy" and "encouragement" to the Tibetan rebels. Even officials of the Indian government distributed so-called "statements by the Dalai Lama," and there were even cries demanding "Tibetan independence." Isn't this series of activities an interference in our internal affairs? Given the long-standing traditional friendship between China and India, and the joint advocacy of the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," we have exercised restraint time and again. But I must advise the gentlemen in India that if this continues, it is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The rebellion in Tibet will soon be thoroughly quelled, and the plot for "Tibetan independence" has been completely bankrupt. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan people will soon forever escape the suffering of poverty, backwardness, and darkness, and embark on the bright road of democracy, prosperity, and happiness. All reactionaries at home and abroad need not waste their efforts.

　　I am a veterinary science worker. Now, I would like to share some of my experiences and understanding in this area.

　　Vigorously Develop Livestock Production

　　With the rapid development of socialist construction and the ever-increasing improvement of people's living standards, the position of animal husbandry in the national economy is becoming increasingly important. At present, livestock power is still the main source of agricultural power in our country; high yields in farmland always require a large amount of manure; light industries such as wool spinning, meat, dairy products, and leather processing need livestock products as raw materials; at the same time, livestock products are important export goods for foreign trade. Furthermore, from the perspective of improving people's living standards, if each person eats an average of four ounces of meat per day, more than 60 billion catties are needed a year. Calculating at 100 catties of net meat per pig, more than 600 million pigs need to be slaughtered; if each person eats two eggs a day, more than 400 billion eggs are needed a year. Calculating at 180 eggs per hen per year, more than 2 billion hens need to be raised. What huge numbers these are! The Party pointed out in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee that great attention should be paid to the development of animal husbandry. The "Ten Initiatives" proposed by the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction require that the output value of animal husbandry this year should be doubled compared to last year. In the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li Fuchun this time, the issue of developing animal husbandry was repeatedly mentioned. This shows how much the Party and the state care about and emphasize accelerating the development of animal husbandry.

　　Our country has vast grasslands and mountainous areas, and the potential for developing livestock breeding is great. Due to the bumper harvest in agriculture, there will be more and more livestock feed; especially after the nationwide people's communeization, the most fundamental and favorable conditions have been created for the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, a great leap forward in animal husbandry is also entirely possible.

　　Based on the situation in Gansu Province, I have the following points of experience:

　　1. Relying on the leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and launching mass movements on a large scale are the fundamental guarantees for doing a good job in animal husbandry. For example, in Yuzhong County, due to "three books in command, four leaders supervising the battle, the entire Party mobilized, and the entire people acting," in 1958 it basically became a "disease-free livestock" county.

　　2. Vigorously promote livestock protection and breeding. Many areas in Gansu Province have adopted various methods such as supplementary feeding, irrigation with clear oil, and classified, divided, and separate trough feeding, striving to achieve guaranteed fitness, guaranteed pregnancy, and guaranteed survival. In terms of breeding, last year, Linxia Autonomous Prefecture established 362 commune-run breeding stations and 61 artificial insemination stations, achieving mating for every animal, continuous mating, and mating during heat, and used various methods to induce estrus. It also fully utilized the efficiency of superior breeding stock and vigorously improved the quality of livestock. Last year, the artificial insemination station for sheep in Yongdeng County created the highest record of one Caucasian ram inseminating 5,327 ewes. Recently, the province required leaders at all levels to personally take charge, seize the opportunity to do a good job in the "four checks" (checking the number and estrus of breeding-age females, the number and quality of breeding males, the number and quality of breeding personnel, and the preparation of breeding equipment), "five fixings" (organizing professional breeding teams; fixing people, animals, tasks, time, and quality), and "two arrangements" (uniformly arranging breeding plans, uniformly arranging livestock), requiring a hard battle for one hundred days to basically achieve full mating and pregnancy for large livestock.

　　3. Actively improve feeding management and vigorously grasp fodder and feed. After communeization, many agricultural areas have established feeding, management, and usage systems. This guarantees the normal development of livestock. In the pastoral areas of Gannan Autonomous Prefecture, the composition of livestock herds was improved, grassland management committees were established, herdsmen were democratically selected, and zonal grazing and regular rotational grazing were implemented according to grassland conditions and livestock types. The "three fixings" system (fixing people, groups, and pastures) was also formulated and promoted; grass was generally stored for winter preparation, sheds and pens were built, supplementary feeding was provided for young and weak livestock, and some places also planted pasture. In order to eliminate locusts on the grassland, aerial spraying was carried out to kill locusts.

　　4. Vigorously carry out mass livestock epidemic prevention campaigns and implement the policy of uniting Chinese and Western veterinary medicine, combining indigenous and foreign methods to prevent and control animal diseases. Mobilizing the masses, organizing movements, acting preemptively, attacking on all fronts, periodic injections, and comprehensive epidemic prevention are the best methods for eliminating animal diseases. Yuzhong County once created the advanced experience of launching a blitz campaign to inject 140,000 heads of large and small livestock, clean and disinfect more than 28,000 rooms, and build more than 1,500 trough channels within 24 hours, setting off a mass upsurge in livestock epidemic prevention. Currently, the entire province is striving to "disinfect every pen, inject every head, and strive to achieve ten no's and four controls for the province."

　　Chinese and Western Veterinary Medicine Unite and Cooperate to Promote Common Progress

　　To carry out epidemic prevention campaigns and further improve animal disease prevention and control work, we should conscientiously implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, unite Chinese and Western veterinarians, and jointly serve the people's animal husbandry cause, jointly promote the legacy of the motherland's veterinary medicine, and develop our country's veterinary science. Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine is part of the motherland's scientific and cultural heritage. It has the same theoretical system as traditional Chinese medicine, has rich diagnostic and treatment experience and theoretical knowledge, and many secret prescriptions and tested prescriptions are circulating in rural and pastoral areas throughout the motherland. It can cure many diseases, including some diseases for which Western veterinary medicine has poor efficacy, and has its own unique expertise. For many years, it has made a huge contribution to ensuring the development of animal husbandry. Western veterinary medicine has received modern scientific education, masters modern medical technology, uses modern medical equipment, and has manufactured many effective biological drugs, which have also played a significant role in ensuring the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, the unity and cooperation of Chinese and Western veterinary medicine and mutual promotion are completely necessary. The motherland's veterinary medicine heritage is indeed a "great treasure house." Inheriting and promoting the motherland's veterinary medicine and raising it to the level of modern science is the glorious responsibility of our country's veterinary workers. Precisely because Western veterinary medicine has certain modern scientific knowledge, a portion of the Western veterinarians in service should be organized to systematically study traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, taking its essence, so that our country's modern veterinary medicine can be further enriched, better serve livestock production, and create a new school of veterinary medicine in our country.

　　In 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, the active role of Chinese and Western veterinarians was brought into play. In terms of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have excavated many effective tested prescriptions and secret prescriptions, and found effective therapies for lamb dysentery, piglet white diarrhea, equine and mule impaction, maxillary sinusitis, and asthenia; in terms of acupuncture treatment, significant efficacy has been proven for more than a dozen diseases such as equine injury causing difficulty in rising and lying down, rheumatism, and sprain lameness; in terms of organizing the motherland's castration techniques, the ovarian removal technique for gilts has been significantly improved; combined Chinese and Western veterinary medicine treatment of acute active equine glanders, tetanus, etc., has also achieved good results.

　　This year is a year of greater leap forward in animal husbandry. The tasks of production and research are arduous and complex. We will certainly continue to promote the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and make more and greater contributions to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China.

　　继承和发扬祖国兽医学遗产
    蒋次升代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。并坚决拥护中央人民政府彻底平息西藏叛乱的方针和措施。
    西藏的武装叛乱已经平息
    西藏从来就是我国的神圣领土，西藏反动分子的武装叛乱和对西藏叛乱的平息，这完全是我们国家自己的事，任何外国不能干涉。当然，一贯与中国人民为敌的帝国主义乘机兴风作浪，我们是可以预料到的，但遗憾的是，在我们伟大的邻邦印度，一些报纸上也公然出现了对我国的诬蔑，某些政治家的议论和声明也竟然对西藏叛乱分子给以“同情”和“鼓励”，甚至由印度政府的官员散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，还有要求所谓“西藏独立”的叫嚣。这一系列的活动，不是干涉我国内政吗？鉴于中印两国有着悠久的传统友谊，并且共同倡导了“五项原则”，因此，我们是一忍再忍。但要忠告印度的先生们，如果这样继续下去，是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。西藏的叛乱，很快就要彻底平息，“西藏独立”的阴谋已经完全破产，西藏人民在中国共产党和毛主席，以及西藏自治区筹备委员会的领导下，即将永远摆脱贫困、落后、黑暗的痛苦，走上民主、繁荣、幸福的社会主义光明大道。国内外一切反动派，不用枉费心机了。
    我是一个兽医科学工作者，现在，我就这方面谈一点体会和认识。
    大力发展畜牧业生产
    随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展和人民生活的日益提高，畜牧业在国民经济中所占的地位愈来愈显得重要了。目前，在我国农业动力主要还靠畜力；农田的高产，任何时候也需要大量的厩肥；毛纺、肉类、奶品、皮革加工等轻工业，需要畜产品作为原料；同时，畜产品又是对外贸易重要的出口物资。再从提高人民生活水平来说，如果平均每人一天吃四两肉，一年就需要六百多亿斤，以一头猪净肉一百斤计算，就要宰六亿多头猪；如果每人一天吃两个鸡蛋，一年就需要四千多亿个，以一个母鸡一年生一百八十个蛋计算，就要饲养二十多亿只母鸡。这是多么巨大的数字！党在八届六中全会决议中指出，要极大地注意畜牧业的发展，全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议提出的“十大倡议”中，要求今年畜牧业的产值比去年增加一倍左右。这次周总理和李富春副总理的报告中，又一再提到发展畜牧业问题，可见党和国家对加速发展畜牧业是多么的关怀和重视。
    我国有广大的草原和山区，发展饲畜业的潜力是很大的；由于农业的丰产，牲畜饲料也将越来越多；特别是全国人民公社化以后，为畜牧业的发展创造了最根本最有利的条件。因此，畜牧业的大跃进同样是完全可能的。
    就甘肃省的情况看，我有以下几点体会：
    一、依靠党的领导，政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，是作好畜牧工作的根本保证。例如榆中县，由于“三书挂帅，四长督战，全党动员，全民动手”，一九五八年就基本上成为“无畜疫”县。
    二、大抓保畜配种。甘肃省许多地区采取补饲、灌清油和分类、分膘、分槽喂养等各种办法，力争作到保膘、保胎、保活。在配种方面，去年，临夏自治州就建立了社营配种站三百六十二处，人工授精站六十一处，作到了头头配，连续配，配热胎，并用多种多样的方法催情。还充分发挥了优良种畜的利用效率，大力改良家畜质量。永登县绵羊人工授精站，去年创造了一只高加索公羊授配五千三百二十七只母羊的最高纪录。最近省上要求各级领导亲自挂帅，抓紧时机做好“四查”（查清适龄应配母畜的头数和发情情况，查种公畜的数量质量，查配种员的数量质量，查配种器械的准备情况）、“五定”（组织配种专业组；定人、定畜、定任务、定时间、定质量）、“两安排”（统一安排配种计划，统一安排牲畜），要求苦战一百天，基本实现大家畜的全配全怀。
    三、积极改善饲养管理，大抓饲草饲料。公社化以后，许多农区都建立了饲养、管理和使用的制度。这就保证了牲畜的正常发展。在甘南自治州的牧区，改进了畜群组成，建立了草原管理委员会，民主选拔牧工，根据草原情况和牲畜种类，实行了分区放牧、定期轮放，并制订和推行了“三定”（定人、定群、定牧）制度；普遍进行了储草备冬，修建棚圈，并给幼弱牲畜进行补饲，有的地方还种植了牧草。为了消灭草原的蝗虫，进行了飞机散药灭蝗。
    四、大力开展群众性家畜防疫运动，贯彻团结中西兽医、土洋结合防治兽疫的方针。发动群众、组织运动、先发制人、全线进攻、定期注射、全面防疫，是消灭兽疫的最好方法。榆中县曾创造了二十四小时内突击预防注射大小家畜十四万头、清圈消毒二万八千多间、修建槽道一千五百多个的先进经验，掀起了群众性牲畜防疫的高潮。目前全省正为“圈圈消毒，头头注射。力争实现十无、四控制省”而奋斗。
    中西兽医团结合作共同促进
    开展防疫运动和进一步作好兽疫防治工作，应该认真贯彻党的中兽医政策，团结中西兽医，共同为人民畜牧事业服务，共同发扬祖国兽医学遗产和发展我国兽医科学。中兽医是祖国科学文化遗产的一部分，它和中医有着相同的理论体系，有着丰富的诊疗经验和理论知识，还有很多秘方、验方流传在祖国各个农村和牧区，能治好很多疾病，包括一些用西兽医方法疗效较差的疾病，有其独特专长，多少年来，对确保畜牧业的发展有着巨大的贡献。西兽医受过现代科学教育，掌握着现代医疗技术，使用现代的医疗设备，并且制造了很多效能良好的生物药品，在保证畜牧业的发展上也起到了重大作用。因此，中西兽医的团结合作，互相促进是完全必要的。祖国的兽医学遗产，的确是一个“伟大的宝库”，继承和发扬祖国的兽医学，并且把它提高到现代科学水平，是我国兽医工作者的光荣责任。正因为西兽医具有一定的现代科学知识，所以应该组织一部分在职的西兽医，系统地学习中兽医，取其精华，使我国的现代兽医学更加丰富起来，更好地为畜牧业生产服务，并创造出我国新的兽医学派。
    一九五八年，在党的英明领导和党的中兽医政策的光辉照耀下，发挥了中西兽医的积极作用。在中兽医方面，各省、自治区、市都发掘出很多有效的验方和秘方，对羔羊痢疾、仔猪白痢、马骡结症、颔窦炎、虚劳症等，找到了有效疗法；针灸治疗方面，对马伤水起卧、风湿症、闪伤跛行等十几种疾病，已证明有显著的疗效；在整理祖国割术方面，小母猪的卵巢摘除术有显著的提高；中西兽医结合治疗急性活动性马鼻疽、破伤风等，也获得了良好的效果。
    今年，是畜牧业更大跃进的一年，生产要研究的任务，都是艰巨而复杂的，我们一定和继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，做出更多更大的贡献，来迎接我们伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年。
