    A Bridge of Soviet-Chinese Friendship
    —Introducing the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly—
    Gē Bǎoquán
    The "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly, published in Chinese by the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association for our vast Chinese readership, has issued seventy issues since its inception on January 1, 1958. The "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly is a popular publication primarily dedicated to introducing various aspects of the Soviet Union and promoting Soviet-Chinese friendship. Since its initial publication over a year ago, it has been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and widely distributed throughout China. Our vast readership has consistently regarded it as a valued teacher and beneficial friend.
    Because this magazine is published weekly, it can promptly reflect every major event in the lives of the Soviet people and its development. In the past half-year, the weekly dedicated considerable space in the issues published before the end of last year to introduce the magnificent program for building communism—the Seven-Year Plan—and the enthusiasm of the entire Soviet people using communist labor to welcome the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). After the opening of the 21st CPSU Congress at the beginning of this year, the weekly, through newly opened columns such as "On the Construction Site of the Seven-Year Plan," "The Seven-Year Plan in Action," and "Advanced Figures of the Seven-Year Plan," and a series of texts, photographs, and charts, introduces the struggle of the entire Soviet people to realize the Seven-Year Plan. For example, from the recently published issues, we can read many special articles written by responsible comrades from various aspects and departments of the Soviet Union, such as "The Russian Federation in the Seven-Year Plan," "Kazakhstan in the Seven-Year Plan," "Moscow in the Seven-Year Plan," "Soviet Trade Unions and the Seven-Year Plan," "Railway Employees and the Seven-Year Plan," "The Seven-Year Plan of Our Agricultural Collective," and "Soviet Film Industry in the Seven-Year Plan." This is of great help to us in understanding how the Soviet people are comprehensively carrying out communist construction.
    Like China, the Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country. Therefore, the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly frequently dedicates considerable space to introducing the situation of various union republics and autonomous republics, allowing us to understand the construction achievements of these ethnic republics in political, economic, and cultural aspects, and their literature, art, and even customs.
    The "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly also frequently introduces the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in science and technology. These articles are mostly written by famous scientists and are very vivid and interesting. They tell you how the Dubna atomic city by the Volga River lives and works; how artificial earth satellites and space rockets have revealed the secrets of the universe and opened the road to the stars for mankind; how the world's first atomic icebreaker has been completed; how electronic computers and the "Tu-114" jet airliner are creating miracles; they will take you to travel to the distant Antarctica, to visit the "Mirny" station, the location of the Soviet Antarctic expedition team, they will take you to the "Vityaz" research vessel of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oceanography, allowing you to explore the mysteries of the deep Pacific Ocean; they will also tell you that the study of controlling thermonuclear reaction problems will become an important task in the Seven-Year Plan, so that artificial suns can emit dazzling light...
    Through the texts on literature and art published in the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly, you will know that many characters in Serafimovich's novel "The Iron Flood" are still alive; you will visit the homes of the author of "And Quiet Flows the Don," the famous novelist Sholokhov, and the famous poet Tikhonov; you will know that the famous playwright Pogodin has completed a new play praising the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, "Third Pathetique"; you will know how the film "Communist" was produced; you will understand the theme of the famous composer Shostakovich's new symphony "1905"; you will walk into the showrooms of the All-Union Art Exhibition and visit the Exhibition of Fine Arts of Socialist Countries held in Moscow...
    There is also a column called "Soviet-Chinese Friendship Is Growing Stronger," which introduces the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the people of the Soviet Union and China through vivid facts. Here, we know how Lev Tolstoy and Gorky loved the Chinese people; how more than 30,000 Chinese volunteer soldiers participated in the October Revolution and the civil war, fighting to defend the Soviet regime; how the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad collects ancient Chinese art; how Moscow established a scientific center for the study of Chinese issues—the Institute of Chinese Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; how Soviet theaters staged our "Romance of the West Chamber," "Thunderstorm," "Magic Lotus Lantern" and "Baolian Lantern" and other dramas; how the Soviet literary and art circles commemorated the Yuan Dynasty's great playwright Guan Hanqing; how the publishing bureau translated and published Chairman Mao's works, the collection of poems of our past dynasties, the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" and selections of Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun and others; how scientists from China and the Soviet Union maintain close cooperation, mutually exchange lectures, exchange research results, and jointly compile the "Chinese-Russian Dictionary"; and how Soviet hospitals use our acupuncture therapy, etc.
      "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly is a publication with both pictures and texts, and the content and columns are very rich and colorful. We can often see many columns such as "Party Life," "Party Work Experience," "On the Vast Land of the Soviet Union," "Scientific World," "Soviet Technology News," "Soviet People," "Anniversaries," "Visit Notes," "Short Stories," "Poems," "Art Diary," "Sports Life," "Book Reviews," "Customs and Habits," "Philately," and "Correspondence." Therefore, every reader can find something they like to read in the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly. Not long ago, the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly added a new column, "Welcoming the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." From this column, we can see how the Soviet people are preparing to welcome our great festival. Because the content of "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly is all-encompassing, it is not an exaggeration to regard it as an encyclopedia-like publication introducing Soviet life and knowledge.
    Comrade Rogov, the editor-in-chief of the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly, once said:
  "We hope that our 'Soviet-Chinese Friendship' magazine will become an invisible bridge in the great cause of realizing the common goals of the people of the Soviet Union and China—building socialism and communism." I would like to add here that the publication of the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly is also the Soviet people building a bridge of friendship between our two peoples, allowing us to better understand the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union through this bridge, and further enhance and inspire our people's confidence in building socialism.
    Let me borrow the words written by the famous Soviet writer Kochetov for the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" Weekly as the conclusion of this introduction: Let the hands of the Chinese and Soviet people always be tightly held together. "A friend's hand—more precious than gold!"

    一座苏中友谊的桥梁
    ——介绍“苏中友好”周刊——
    戈宝权
    苏中友好协会为我们中国广大读者用中文出版的“苏中友好”周刊，自从1958年1月1日创刊以来，已经出满了七十期。“苏中友好”周刊是一个以介绍苏联各方面的情况和宣传苏中友好为主的通俗刊物，从它最初创刊时起，一年多来，受到我国人民的热烈欢迎，在我国全国各地普遍发行，我国广大的读者一向把它看成是自己的良师和益友。
    由于这个杂志是每周出版的，所以它能及时地反映出苏联人民生活中每一个重大的事件及其发展的情形。就拿近半年来说，周刊在去年年底前出版的各期当中，曾用了相当多的篇幅介绍了建设共产主义的宏伟纲领——七年计划和全苏联人民用共产主义的劳动热忱来迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会的情形。今年年初苏共第二十一次代表大会召开之后，周刊又通过新辟的“在七年计划的建筑工地上”、“七年计划在行动中”、“七年计划的先进人物”等专栏和所发表的一系列的文字、照片和图表，来介绍苏联全国人民为实现七年计划而斗争的情形。像从最近出版的几期当中，我们就可以读到苏联各方面和各部门的负责同志们撰写的“七年计划中的俄罗斯联邦共和国”、“哈萨克斯坦在七年计划中”、“莫斯科在七年计划中”、“苏联工会和七年计划”、“铁路员工和七年计划”、“我们农庄的七年计划”、“七年计划中的苏联电影事业”等许多篇专文，这对于我们了解苏联人民如何全面开展共产主义建设，是有很大的帮助的。
    苏联和我国一样，是一个多民族的国家，因此“苏中友好”周刊经常用相当多的篇幅介绍各加盟共和国和自治共和国的情况，让我们了解到这些民族共和国在政治、经济、文化各方面的建设成就，和他们的文学、艺术一直到风俗习惯的情形。
    “苏中友好”周刊对于苏联在科学技术方面的巨大成就，也经常有所介绍。这些文章多半出自著名的科学家之手，非常生动而有趣。它们告诉你伏尔加河旁的杜布诺原子城怎样在生活和工作；人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭怎样为人类揭开了宇宙的秘密和打开了通往星球的道路；世界上第一艘原子破冰船怎样建造完工；电子计算机和“图——一一四号”喷气式新客机怎样在创造奇迹；它们会把你带到遥远的南极洲去旅行，到苏联南极考察队的所在地“和平村”做客人，它们会把你带到苏联科学院海洋研究所的“勇士号”考察船上去，让你去探测太平洋深处的奥秘；它们又会告诉你，控制热核反应问题的研究将成为七年计划中的重要任务，好让人造太阳发射出耀眼的光芒……。
    通过“苏中友好”周刊上所发表的有关文学和艺术的文字，你就会知道绥拉菲摩维支的小说“铁流”中的不少人物至今还活着；你就会到“静静的顿河”的作者、著名的小说家萧洛霍夫家里和名诗人吉洪诺夫家里去做客人；你就会知道名剧作家包戈廷完成了歌颂伟大革命导师列宁的新剧本“第三首热情颂歌”；你就会知道电影“共产党员”是怎样摄制成的；你就会了解名作曲家萧斯塔科维奇的新交响乐“1905年”的主题，你就会走进全苏美术展览会的陈列室和参观在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家造型艺术展览会……。
    还有一个“苏中友谊日益巩固”的专栏，通过生动的事实，来介绍苏中两国人民的友好关系和文化交流的情况。在这里，我们就知道列夫·托尔斯泰和高尔基是怎样热爱中国人民；中国三万多名志愿军怎样参加了十月革命和国内战争，为保卫苏维埃政权而战；列宁格勒的爱尔米塔什博物馆里怎样收藏着中国古代的艺术品；莫斯科怎样成立了研究中国问题的科学中心——苏联科学院中国学研究所；苏联的剧院怎样上演我国的“西厢记”、“雷雨”、“马兰花”和“宝莲灯”等戏；苏联的文艺界怎样纪念我国元代的大戏曲家关汉卿；出版局怎样翻译出版毛主席的著作、我国历代的诗选、“红楼梦”等长篇小说和鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾等人的选集；中苏两国的科学家怎样保持着密切的合作，相互交换讲学、交流研究成果、合编“华俄大辞典”；苏联的医院又怎样用了我国的针灸疗法等。
      “苏中友好”周刊是一个图文并茂的刊物，内容和栏目非常丰富多彩。我们经常可以看到“党的生活”、“党的工作经验”、“在苏联的辽阔土地上”、“科学世界”、“苏联技术新闻”、“苏维埃人”“纪念日”、“访问记”、“短篇小说”、“诗歌”、“艺术日记”、“体育生活”、“书刊介绍”、“风俗和习惯”、“集邮”、“书信往来”等许多专栏，因此每一个读者，都可以从“苏中友好”周刊上找到他所喜爱阅读的东西。在不久以前，“苏中友好”周刊上又增添了一个新的栏目“迎接中华人民共和国成立十周年”，从这一栏中，就可以看到苏联人民怎样在准备迎接我们的伟大节日。由于“苏中友好”周刊的内容包罗万象，因此我们把它看成是一个介绍苏联生活和知识的百科全书式的刊物，也不算过分。
    “苏中友好”周刊的总编辑罗果夫同志曾这样讲过：
  “我们希望，我们的‘苏中友好’杂志在实现苏中两国人民的共同目标——建成社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业中，成为一座无形的桥梁”。我想应该在这里再补充一句，“苏中友好”周刊的出版，也就是苏联人民在我们两国人民之间架起了一座友谊的桥梁，让我们有可能通过这个桥梁更好地认识苏联和向苏联学习，进一步增强和鼓舞我国人民建设社会主义的信心。
    让我借用苏联名作家柯切托夫为“苏中友好”周刊所写的话来作为这篇介绍的结语：让中苏两国人民的手永远紧紧地握在一起。“朋友的手——比金子还宝贵！”
