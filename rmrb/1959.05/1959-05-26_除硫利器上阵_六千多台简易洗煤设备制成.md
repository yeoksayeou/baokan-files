Xinhua News Agency, May 25th. By the beginning of May, mechanical industry departments in various regions had manufactured 6,204 sets of simple coal washing equipment to support steel industry production.

Provinces and cities have made great efforts to rush-produce simple coal washing equipment, and some provinces and cities have completed their production plans ahead of schedule. Shenyang and Dalian, which had relatively heavy production tasks, completed their entire production plans by the end of April ahead of schedule. The tasks of producing simple coal washing equipment in Beijing, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Gansu have also been completed successively.

In order to complete the production of 222 belt conveyors for coal washing ahead of schedule, Li Yushan, the Party General Branch Secretary of Shenyang Transport Machinery Factory, led a "learning" group composed of cadres, technicians, and veteran workers, and visited seven provinces and cities, learning the experience of many factories manufacturing belt conveyors. Based on the experience of fraternal factories and the factory's own conditions, the factory's employees quickly solved twenty-seven production technical problems, which played a significant role in ensuring product quality and completing the manufacturing task of belt conveyors ahead of schedule. Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory improved the casting method, shortening the production cycle of toothed roller crushers from four to five months to three months; the number of batches produced increased from twenty to sixty. Factories in Dalian, Jinan, Guizhou, and Changsha have also made their own innovations in carrying out technical innovation movements to accelerate the manufacturing of coal washing machines.

In the process of manufacturing simple coal washing equipment, all regions attached great importance to product quality. In order to prevent unqualified products from leaving the factory, the employees of Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory strictly implemented a system of one arrangement every five days and one inspection per day; when processing major parts, they tried to use molds that could guarantee product quality. Some factories in Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places that undertook the manufacture of simple coal washing equipment also adhered to the quality inspection system, and most of the products were of good quality.

Thirty-three sets of the produced coal washing equipment have already been fully equipped, and the remaining part is still in urgent need of matching equipment. The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the mechanical industry departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities are taking measures in terms of material allocation and production collaboration to strengthen the equipment matching work.

    除硫利器上阵
    六千多台简易洗煤设备制成
    新华社25日讯  到5月上旬为止，各地机械工业部门已经制造了六千二百零四台简易洗煤设备，支援钢铁工业生产。
    各省、市对于赶制简易洗煤设备都作了很大的努力，有些省、市已经提前完成了生产计划。承制任务比较繁重的沈阳市和旅大市，在4月底就提前完成了全部生产计划。北京、湖南、云南、贵州、甘肃等省、市生产简易洗煤设备的任务，也已先后完成。
    沈阳运输机厂为了提前完成洗煤用的二百二十二台皮带运输机，工厂党的总支书记李玉山曾带领一个由干部、技术人员和老工人参加的“取经”团，走访了七个省市，学习了许多制造皮带运输机工厂的经验。全厂职工根据兄弟工厂的经验和本厂条件，迅速地攻破了二十七项生产技术课题，对于保证产品质量和提前完成皮带运输机的制造任务，起了很大作用。上海矿山机械厂改进了铸造方法，使齿辊式破碎机的生产周期由四、五个月缩短到三个月；每批生产的数量从二十台增加到了六十台。旅大、济南、贵州和长沙等地的有关工厂，在开展技术革新运动加速制造洗煤机方面，也都各有创造。
    在制造简易洗煤设备的过程中，各地都十分重视产品的质量。贵阳矿山机器厂职工为了不让不合格的产品出厂，严格执行了五日一布置，一日一检查的制度；加工主要零件时，尽量采用能保证产品质量的模具。沈阳、上海等地承制简易洗煤设备的一些工厂，也都坚持了质量检查制度，绝大部分产品质量良好。
    生产出来的洗煤设备，已经配成套的有三十三套，下余的一部分还急待配套。第一机械工业部和各省、市机械工业厅、局，正在从材料调配和生产协作等方面采取措施，加强这些设备配套工作。
