　　"Three Guarantees and One Reward" Promotes Pear Tree Production

　　The Shaheya Production Team of the Waliwang People's Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, has a total of 223 households, 423 laborers, and 3,012 mu of cultivated land, including 407 mu of pear orchards (excluding young trees). Last year, the team achieved a bumper harvest of pears. In order to strive for continued high yields of pears this year, they improved orchard production management, strengthened the production responsibility system, and implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and quota management system, further stimulating the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members for orchard management. In terms of orchard management, by the end of March and early April, they had already plowed and cultivated between the rows of trees, scraped the bark, and pruned the branches. 2.44 million jin of coarse fertilizer had been applied to the 407 mu of pear trees. Among them, 36 mu of high-yield experimental fields had been applied with 14,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and 4,000 jin of fine fertilizer per mu. 372 mu had been irrigated, including 82 mu that had been irrigated twice. In terms of pest control, the 407 mu of pear trees had been sprayed with "223" emulsion three times. In addition, 270 mu had been sprayed with lime sulfur mixture once, eliminating pear caterpillars, pear fruit borers, and spider mites, achieving pest-free trees and weed-free ground.

　　In improving orchard management, the Shaheya Production Team established specialized labor organizations. Among the 423 laborers in the team, 60 laborers with experience in orchard management were selected and organized into three specialized orchard management teams, responsible for managing three orchard production areas and three high-yield orchard blocks (36 mu) respectively. When encountering rush tasks, more manpower was organized to complete them. After setting the three major plans for orchard production, finance, and labor, the production team promoted the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system to the production teams. According to the commune's pear yield requirements for each team and the team's specific conditions, and considering the soil quality and water conservancy conditions of each orchard production area, the output, investment, and labor quotas were contracted to each production team.

　　First, contract work based on the grade of the pear trees: In order to ensure the normal growth and fruiting of each and every pear tree, the amount of labor and operating procedures were appropriately determined according to the grade of the pear trees and the amount of flowering, and quality requirements were put forward. Contracting work was assigned to the production teams, thus avoiding reduced production due to the limitation of labor, the inability to carefully manage pear trees with more flowers and fruits, and the occurrence of biennial bearing of pear trees due to neglecting management because of small or no income in the current year.

　　In order to closely integrate the collective responsibility system with the individual responsibility system, each production team adopted the management methods of team contracting blocks and individual contracting rows and trees for the orchards of the team, and promoted quota management of labor. After discussions between cadres and commune members, the quantity to be completed by an average laborer in one day was determined for each type of farm work according to the technical complexity, labor intensity, and cleanliness of the farm work. The "six fixings" (fixing measures, fixing work points, fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing quantity, fixing quality) method was adopted for each commune member, and work points were evaluated and recorded accordingly. In labor management, the fixed grade and flexible wage system was generally implemented to further implement the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work.

　　Second, contract output: To promote each commune member's sense of responsibility for orchard management and ensure the implementation of measures, the production team contracted output to the production teams. Before contracting output, the three team leaders and three fruit farmers with higher skills were organized to conduct a detailed observation of the amount of flowering of the pear trees this year, and divided them into three yield grades according to the grade of the trees and the amount of flowering. That is, each grade of tree was divided into three levels: level one flowering 60% to 80%, level two flowering 30% to 50%, and level three flowering 10% to 20%. This served as the first output target for this year. Because the contracting of work and output was done relatively late this year, after the small pears had set, the output was revised once and fixed according to the grade increase or decrease, and contracted to the production team as the official output target. When purchasing, 20% of the over-production exceeding the production target was returned to the production team, and 80% was returned to the production team. If there were no special natural disasters, the production team was responsible for the reduced production.

　　Third, contract investment: Medicines and equipment, such as sprayers, pesticides "1605", DDT, Bordeaux mixture and fine fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, etc., were prepared by the production team and allocated to each production team. Small tools were supplied by the production team. Fertilizer was supplied according to the grade of the trees and operating procedures, and coarse fertilizer was uniformly allocated to the production teams by the production team.

　　Fourth, there were three rewards and three penalties throughout the year. The first reward was given after pruning and scraping bark, cultivating and fertilizing, and watering. The second reward was given after disease and pest control. The third reward was given after harvest. Each reward adhered to the spirit of more rewards and fewer penalties, and rewards were given in the form of physical objects or work points.

　　Although the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system has not been implemented for a long time, it has shown great advantages. Liu Zhongke originally sprayed five mu of medicine per day, but now he has increased it to seven mu. Liu Dianqing originally cultivated one mu of standard ridges per day, but now he has increased it to one and a half mu. (Jiao Lin)

　　“三包一奖”促进了梨树生产
    河北交河县洼里王公社沙河涯生产队共二百二十三户，有劳动力四百二十三人，有耕地三千零一十二亩，其中梨果四百零七亩（不包括幼树），去年这个队的梨果获得了丰收。为了争取今年梨果继续丰产，他们改进了果树生产管理，健全了生产责任制，推行了三包一奖和定额管理制度，进一步激发起广大干部和社员对果树管理的积极性。在果树管理方面，到三月底四月初就已经把树行树挡耕刨完，刮完皮，整完了枝，四百零七亩梨树已施粗肥二百四十四万斤，其中丰产试验田三十六亩，每亩已施粗肥一万四千斤，细肥四千斤。已浇水三百七十二亩，其中浇二遍的八十二亩。在除虫方面，四百零七亩梨树已普遍喷过“二二三”乳剂三次，另外，二百七十亩，喷硫磺合剂一次，消灭了梨蝗毛虫、梨大食心虫，火蜘蛛，实现了树上无虫，地下无草。
    在改进果树管理中，沙河涯生产队建立了专业性的劳动组织。在全队四百二十三名劳动力中，找出对果树管理有经验的六十名劳力，编为三个果树管理专业小队，分别管理三个果树生产区，和三个果树丰产方（三十六亩）。遇到突击性的工作时，就组织更多的人力去完成。在定好果树生产、财务、劳力三大规划以后，生产队向生产小队推行了“三包一奖”制，按照公社对各队梨树的产量要求和该队的具体情况，并考虑了各果树生产区的土质水利等条件，把产量投资和用工指标包给各生产小队。
    第一，按果树的等级进行包工：为了保证块块、棵棵梨树的正常生长和结果，根据梨树的等级和开花的多少，适当确定了用工的数量和操作规程，提出质量要求，向生产小队进行包工，因而避免了因用工的限制，不能对开花多结果多的梨树细致管理而造成减产，和当年收益不大或无收益而忽视管理、造成梨树隔年结果现象的发生。
    为了使集体责任制与个人责任制密切结合，各生产小队又将该小队果树采取了组包块和人包行与棵的管理办法，推行了劳动定额管理。经过干部和社员们的讨论，对各项农活根据技术繁简、劳动强度、农活的脏净等按照一个中等劳力一天完成的数量，确定一个劳动日应完成的数量，对每个社员采取了“六固定”（定措施、定工分、定任务、定时间、定数量、定质量）的办法，依此评工记分。在劳动管理中普遍推行死级别、活工资，进一步贯彻了按劳取酬、多劳多得的原则。
    第二、包产：为促使每个社员对果树管理加强责任心，措施落实，生产队向生产小队进行包产。在包产前组织了三个队长和三个技术较高的果农，到果园进行细致观察果树今年花的多少，按树的等级、花的多少划为三级产量。即每等树分三级，一级花60％至80％，二级花30％至50％，三级花10％至20％，这样作为今年第一次包产指标。因今年包工包产搞的较晚，梨树已开花，所以在小梨坐住以后，再修定一次产量，按等级增减固定下来，作为正式包产指标，包给生产小队。收购时对超过生产指标的超产部分，20％归生产队，80％归生产小队，如无特殊自然灾害，减产部分由生产小队负责。
    第三、包投资：药械，如喷雾器、农药“1605”、滴滴涕、波尔多液及细肥、化肥等，由生产队备办，拨到各生产小队。小型用具由生产队供给。肥料，按树的等级和操作规程供给，粗肥由生产队统一调剂到生产小队。
    第四、全年分三奖三罚，第一次在修剪刮皮、中耕施肥、浇水后进行奖励，第二次在防治病虫后奖励，第三次在收获后奖励。每次奖励掌握多奖少罚的精神，奖励实物或工分。
    在推行三包一奖制后，虽然时间不长，已显示出很大优越性，刘众可原来每天喷药五亩，现增到七亩；刘殿清原一天搞标准畦化一亩，现提高到一亩半。　（交林）
