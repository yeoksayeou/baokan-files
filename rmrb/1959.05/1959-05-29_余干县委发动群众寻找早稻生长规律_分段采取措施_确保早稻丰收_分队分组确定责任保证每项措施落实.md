This newspaper, Nanchang, May 28th: YuGan County, Jiangxi Province, adopts management measures based on the nine stages of early rice growth (regreening, tillering, stem elongation, booting, heading, grain filling, drooping, hardening, harvesting) to cultivate early rice scientifically.

After finishing rice transplanting at the end of April, the YuGan County Committee immediately mobilized the people of the county to summarize last year's field management experience and discuss this year's field management. In summarizing their experiences, commune members cited many examples of bumper early rice harvests from their own communes and teams last year, proving that field management based on the different stages of early rice growth played an important role in achieving high yields. At the same time, they analyzed the characteristics of this year's transplanting. The County Committee collected the experiences summarized by the masses and the methods they proposed, studied them repeatedly, and finally, based on the nine stages of early rice growth, developed cultivation methods stage by stage and formulated a set of scientific field management plans for the communes to refer to and implement.

YuGan County has adopted comprehensive field management measures tailored to the different stages of early rice growth, with different cultivation methods. Regreening stage: 1. Universally apply fast-acting fertilizers such as soil-prepared fertilizer, bean cake, and manure. Apply lime and gypsum to fields with Chinese milk vetch to accelerate the decomposition of the Chinese milk vetch. 2. Irrigate the fields in a timely manner. Generally, perform the first shallow plowing one week after transplanting. 3. Control irrigation according to temperature changes; irrigate deeply when it is cold and shallowly when it is hot. These methods enable the seedlings to grow quickly and take root. Tillering stage: 1. Conduct the second weeding, plowing appropriately deeper to help the seedlings grow. 2. Apply the second topdressing, applying green manure in mountainous areas and lake grass compost and manure in plains. 3. Implement shallow irrigation. 4. Remove barnyard grass. This helps the seedlings tiller in the early stage, controls tillering in the later stage, and limits ineffective tillering. Stem elongation and booting stages: 1. Combine the third weeding with the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers such as wood ash and clam shell powder to make the seedling stems grow thick and strong. 2. Implement frequent and shallow irrigation, irrigating during the day when the temperature is high (which is conducive to seedling growth) and draining at night when the soil temperature is high (which is not conducive to seedling growth). At the same time, universally spray pesticides once to prevent damage from rice stem borers and rice thrips. Heading and grain filling stages: 1. Carry out shallow irrigation, but ensure that the field is constantly watered to avoid affecting grain filling. 2. Be vigilant against pests. 3. At this time, the seedlings are flowering, so take strict precautions against livestock and wild animals entering the fields and damaging the seedlings. Drooping and hardening stages: 1. Drain the fields to keep the soil moist, so that the seedlings do not grow leaves, in order to increase the length of the ear, make the grains plump and heavy, and achieve early maturity. 2. Open horizontal and vertical ditches in the fields to facilitate ventilation and increase sunshine. 3. Prevent damage from birds and animals. During harvesting, in order to achieve careful harvesting and ensure that every grain is returned home, iron, wood, and bamboo workers are now being organized to manufacture and repair harvesting tools, and harvesting teams are being organized as early as possible, harvesting each field as it ripens.

YuGan County also put forward the following four methods to prevent early rice lodging: 1. Scientific fertilization. Apply nitrogen fertilizer in the early stage of seedling growth, apply more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer in the middle stage, and apply less or stop applying fertilizer in the later stage when the seedlings are growing vigorously. Control excessive leaf growth and increase the thickness of the base stems. 2. Rational irrigation. After transplanting, irrigate frequently and shallowly; during the stem elongation and hardening stages, the density is high and moisture is not easy to evaporate, so maintain moist irrigation; drain and dry the fields once or twice before stem elongation and after hardening. This allows the seedlings to take root deeper and increase the hardness of the stems. 3. During the drooping and hardening stages, because the temperature inside the dense rice clumps is high, it is necessary to open up ditches to ventilate and cool down, preventing the stems from rotting; at the same time, gently knock off the dew on the leaves and ears of rice every morning to reduce the weight on the stems. 4. For seedlings that are growing too vigorously, cut off the tips of the rice stalks in a timely manner after tillering and before stem elongation to help the rice grow stems.

In order to implement the above measures formulated by the County Committee, all communes, production brigades, and production teams in the county immediately launched a vigorous field management campaign, fiercely attacking the regreening, tillering, and stem elongation stages of early rice. The XinHe Commune widely launched field management appraisal competitions between teams and between commune members. The DaXi Commune specifically established a field management responsibility system, with teams, groups, and households contracting the cultivation and management of fields, and the commune regularly checks the progress and quality, ensuring that all field management measures are implemented to the end. The first secretaries, secretaries, and main cadres of Party organizations at all levels from the county to the production team went deep into the fields to lead and participate in field management activities. At the same time, the County Committee also transferred more than 700 cadres to serve as branch secretaries and team leaders in the production teams, commanding field management on the front line. The first secretaries of the County Committee and the Commune Party Committees respectively led 351 shock teams to set up camps near low-yield fields and meticulously cultivate third-class seedlings.

Now, all the early rice in YuGan County has undergone two weedings and topdressings. The seedlings are growing vigorously, have passed the regreening stage, and in some areas have passed the tillering stage and have begun stem elongation and heading. (Liu Guanghui, Song Peiji) (Attached picture)

    余干县委发动群众寻找早稻生长规律
    分段采取措施　确保早稻丰收
    分队分组确定责任保证每项措施落实
    本报南昌28日电　江西省余干县根据早稻生长过程中的九个阶段（返青、分蘖、圆秆、孕穗、抽穗、灌浆、勾头、壮实、收割），分别采取管理措施，科学地培育早稻。
    余干县在4月底结束插秧后，县委紧接着就发动全县人民总结去年田间管理经验，讨论今年田间管理。在总结经验中，社员们举出许多本社本队去年早稻丰收的事例，证明由于按照早稻生长的不同阶段，采取不同措施进行田间管理，对丰产起了重要作用。同时，分析了今年插秧的特点。县委把群众总结的经验和提出的办法，集中起来又进行了多次研究，最后根据早稻生长过程中的九个阶段，一段一段地拟订出培育的方法，制定了一套科学的田间管理计划，供给各公社参考执行。
    余干县针对早稻生长的不同阶段、采取不同培育方法的全面田间管理措施。返青阶段：一、普遍追施土化肥、枯饼、粪肥等速效性肥料，对红花草田追施石灰、石膏，加速红花草的腐烂；二、及时灌田，一般插秧一周后进行第一次浅耘；一是根据气温变化掌握灌溉，天冷时深灌，天热时浅灌。通过这些办法，使禾苗迅速生长，扎根。分蘖阶段：一、进行第二次耘禾，适当深耘，助苗发兜；二、进行第二次追肥，山区施青叶肥，平原施湖草沤肥和粪肥；三、实行浅灌；四、拔除稗草。这样，帮助禾苗前期分蘖，控制后期分蘖，限制无效分蘖。圆秆、孕穗阶段：一、结合第三次耘禾追施草木灰、蚌壳粉等磷钾肥，使禾苗基秆长得粗壮；二、实行勤灌、浅灌，白天气温高（有利禾苗生长），进行灌水；夜晚地温高（不利禾苗生长），进行排水。同时，普遍喷射一次农药，防止螟虫、伏泥虫为害。抽穗、灌浆阶段：一、进行浅灌，但是保证田里不断水，以免影响灌浆；二、警惕虫害；三、这时禾苗正当扬花，要严防牲畜、野兽进田损害禾苗。勾头、壮实阶段：一、排水干田，保持田里土壤湿润，使禾苗不长叶，以增长谷穗达到穗长、粒饱、粒重，成熟期早。二、在田间开辟横直沟道，以利禾苗通风和增加阳光日晒。三、防止鸟兽损害。收割时，为了做到精打细收，颗粒还家，现在即组织铁、木、篾工人制造和修理收割工具，及早组织收割队伍，成熟一丘就收割一丘。
    余干县还提出了如下四条防止早稻倒伏的办法：一、科学的施肥，禾苗生长前期施氮肥，中期多施磷、钾肥，禾苗生长茂盛的后期少施或停止施肥。控制禾苗过分长叶、增长基秆粗壮。二、合理灌溉。插秧后勤灌、浅灌；圆秆、壮实期因密度大，水分不易蒸发，保持湿润灌溉；圆秆前和壮实后分别排水晒田一次至两次。这样，使禾苗往深处扎根、增强禾秆硬度。三、勾头、壮实期，因禾密禾丛内温度高，需要一面僻沟通风降温，防止禾秆枯烂；一面每天早晨轻轻打掉禾叶、禾穗上的露水，减轻禾秆的负重。四、对于生长太旺盛的禾苗，在分蘖后圆秆前适时割掉禾稻的尖端部分，助禾长秆。
    全县各公社、生产大队和生产队为了贯彻执行县委制订的上述措施、在插秧后立即掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的田间管理运动、猛攻早稻返青、分蘖、圆秆关。信河公社队与队、社员与社员之间广泛开展了田间管理评比竞赛。大溪公社专门建立田间管理责任制，分队、分组、分户包干田亩的培育管理，由公社定期检查进度、质量，把田间管的各项措施都贯彻到底。从县到生产队的各级党组织的第一书记、书记和主要干部都深入田间，领导和参加田间管理活动。同时，县委还抽调了七百多名干部到生产队任支部书记、队长，在第一线指挥田间管理。县委、公社党委的第一书记分别率领了三百五十一个突击队到低产田傍安营扎寨，对三类苗精工培育。
    现在余干县的全部早稻已进行了二次耘禾、追肥，禾苗生长茂盛，跨过了返青关，有的地区的禾苗已跨过了分蘖关，开始了圆秆、抽穗。　（刘光辉、宋培基）（附图片）
