Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Various regions are seizing the season to plant bast fiber crops. Due to the large demand for hemp from industrial development, the planting area for hemp in major producing areas this year will be larger than last year.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture's statistics as of the 7th, the country has sown more than 1.4 million mu of jute, 1.168 million mu of hemp, and more than 160,000 mu of perennial ramie have been raised and are being transplanted successively.

The Yangtze and Pearl River basins are the main producing areas of jute and ramie in China. At present, Zhejiang Province has sown 715,000 mu of jute, exceeding the sowing plan by 65,000 mu; early-sown areas have turned to field management. Hunan Province has sown a total of 390,000 mu of jute and ramie, and is still continuing to sow; the early-sown jute has generally emerged, and the ramie in the old ramie gardens is growing well, with thick stalks and skin, and a general plant height of five or six feet, which can be harvested for the first crop in twenty days (ramie is generally harvested three times a year). Anhui Province's jute and ramie are expected to exceed the national plan by a lot, and the ramie expansion plan has been basically completed. Sichuan Province has raised 34,000 mu of ramie seedlings, which can be used for transplanting 340,000 mu; the ramie gardens in the southern region have begun to harvest the first crop, and the yield per mu has increased significantly compared with last year. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has planted more than 150,000 mu of jute, ramie, etc.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of bast fiber crops, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, Jilin and other provinces have held on-site meetings before the production season, organized training classes, and trained agricultural technicians for the communes; some communes have established specialized hemp planting teams. Haining County, Zhejiang Province, has trained 3,657 hemp planting experts, and Yingde and other three counties in Guangdong Province have established 39 ramie specialized teams. The quality of hemp planting in various places is generally better than in previous years. In the Subu People's Commune of Luan County, Anhui Province, the more than 21,000 mu of hemp land is generally deeply ploughed to about one foot, and 500 dan of fertilizer are applied per mu in layers, and the seeding amount per mu is increased from 7 jin in previous years to 10 jin. Hunan Province's jute land is generally deeply ploughed more than seven inches, and about 300 dan of base fertilizer is applied per mu. Ramie gardens in various places have generally carried out winter soil cultivation and fertilization, spring intertillage and topdressing, as well as wind and insect prevention. Yangxin County, Hubei Province, has launched a climax of cultivating and managing ramie. The county's hemp fields have generally been weeded once or twice, topdressed with soil fertilizer, and more than 29,000 people have been mobilized to control pests in 26,000 mu of hemp fields. Now the first crop is growing vigorously and a bumper harvest is expected. (Attached picture)

    各地抓紧季节种植麻类
    主要产区力求扩大种植面积
    新华社15日讯　各地正抓紧季节种植麻类作物。由于工业发展对麻的需要量很大，今年各主要产麻区种麻面积将比去年扩大。
    据农业部到7日为止的统计，全国已播种黄麻一百四十多万亩、大麻一百一十六点八万亩，多年生的苎麻已育苗十六万多亩，正陆续移栽。
    长江、珠江流域是我国黄麻和苎麻的主要产区。现在，浙江省已播种黄麻七十一点五万亩，超额六万五千亩完成了播种计划；早播地区已转入田间管理。湖南省播种黄麻、苎麻共三十九万亩，目前仍在继续播种中；早播的黄麻已经普遍出苗，老麻园的苎麻生长良好，秆粗皮厚，一般株高五、六尺，二十天后即可割头麻（苎麻一般一年收三次）。安徽省黄麻、苎麻预计可超过国家计划很多，已基本上完成苎麻扩种计划。四川省苎麻育苗三万四千亩，可供移栽三十四万亩；南部地区苎麻园已开始收头麻，亩产量比去年有显著提高。广西僮族自治区已种植黄麻、苎麻等十五万多亩。
    为了争取麻类丰产，浙江、湖南、江西、福建、安徽、吉林等省在生产季节前都开过现场会，办训练班，培养了公社种麻的技术员；有的公社成立了种麻专业队。浙江省海宁县培养种麻能手三千六百五十七名，广东省英德等三县建立苎麻专业队三十九个，各地种麻质量一般也较往年为好。安徽省六安县苏埠人民公社二万一千多亩大麻地，一般深耕一尺左右，每亩分层施肥五百担，每亩播种量由往年的七斤增加到十斤。湖南省黄麻地一般深耕七寸以上，每亩施基肥三百担左右。各地苎麻园一般都进行了冬季培土施肥、入春中耕追肥以及防风防虫等工作。湖北省阳新县掀起了培育管理苎麻的高潮，全县麻地普遍锄草一——二遍，追施了土化肥，并出动二万九千多人除治了二万六千亩麻地的害虫，现在头麻生长茁壮，可望丰收。（附图片）
