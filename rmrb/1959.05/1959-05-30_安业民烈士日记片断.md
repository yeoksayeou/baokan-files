Editor's Note: Martyr An Yemin was a coastal artillery soldier of a certain unit on the Fujian Front. He died heroically on August 23, 1958, during the artillery battle, while bravely rescuing artillery pieces. The CCP Navy Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army posthumously recognized him as a formal member of the CCP and launched a "Learn from An Yemin Movement" in the Navy. Below are excerpts from his diary.

	November 20, 1957 Wednesday
	Morning, a new day has begun. Our emotions are like the red glow emitted by the sun.

	November 23, 1957 Saturday
	A revolutionary soldier should use his own blood to defend the people's construction of a beautiful society, a lovely home, and the beloved mountains and rivers of the motherland. Wherever the people point, whatever they demand, I will not haggle, and will serve the people. I feel proud and honored to be able to use my own hands to defend and build this land that gave birth to me. My strength and confidence cannot be broken or soaked through by storms!

	December 3, 1957 Tuesday
	I am reading a book that writes about the heroic deeds of revolutionary predecessors, which has given me a profound education ideologically. As I read it page by page, I realize how arduous the revolution was and how cruel the counter-revolutionaries were. The revolutionary predecessors were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, and they did not hesitate to sacrifice everything for the sake of the collective. Sometimes, when they fell into the hands of the enemy, they would not say anything to avoid causing losses to the Party. This admirable and moving noble quality will forever live in the hearts of the people. It has sown a seed of happiness for our next generation, and we must diligently cultivate it with our own hands.

	December 19, 1957 Thursday
	From the movie screen, I saw the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland: Yunnan, with its spring-like weather all year round; the prosperous Nanchang built after liberation (the birthplace of our Chinese People's Liberation Army). Our young soldiers should hold high the "August 1st" military flag and step forward bravely, dedicating our youth and everything to the motherland to complete the magnificent cause of human liberation.

	December 22, 1957 Sunday
	The dim sky gradually turned white, revealing layers of rosy clouds. The plants and trees on the earth smiled happily, as if saying "Good morning!" to us. Our day's work begins at this time. Creating happiness for mankind and defending the people's construction of a beautiful life is the glory of our lives.

	February 13, 1958 Wednesday
	Watched the film "Water"... Difficulties and pain cannot stop the heroes' path forward. With the power of the Party, we can overcome any difficulties, and happiness will come one day.

		× Month × Day
	I will always fight on the coast; it is the land I cannot separate from in life and death. The inspiring heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyrs are the valuable wealth of our army. I must learn from them, stand firm, like the pine trees on the beach. Let the Party test me; no matter how big the storm is, it cannot break or submerge the confidence of a communist fighter...

		× Month × Day
	Everyone will die eventually, some deaths are as light as a feather, while others are as heavy as Mount Tai. The people's heroes, Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang, stepped forward bravely for the victory of the battle, living great and dying gloriously. They were respected by the people and educated countless living people, down to future generations. The only purpose a revolutionary soldier should have for living is to be useful to the people. We came to the front to punish the enemy, and victory will surely be ours. But if we encounter an emergency in battle, I will definitely move forward bravely without hesitation.

    安业民烈士日记片断
    编者按：安业民烈士是我福建前线某部海岸炮兵战士，于1958年8月23日炮战中，因奋身抢救火炮殉国。中共中国人民解放军海军党委，追认他为中共正式党员，并在海军中展开了一个“学习安业民运动”。下边是他的日记片断。
        1957年11月20日　星期三
    早晨，新的一天又开始了。我们的情绪好像太阳发出的红光。
        1957年11月23日　星期六
    一个革命战士应该用自己的热血来保卫人民建设美好的社会、可爱的家园和可爱的祖国河山。人民指向哪里，要求什么东西，我都不讲价钱，为人民服务。能够用自己的双手保卫和建设这块生我的土地，我感到骄傲和自豪。我的力量和信心是暴风雨吹不坏、也淋不透的！
        1957年12月3日　星期二
    我在看一部书，这部书里写的是革命前辈的英雄事迹，使我思想上受到了深刻的教育。我一页一页的看下去，体会到革命有多艰苦，反革命又有多残酷。革命前辈不怕流血牺牲，为了集体的事情，不惜牺牲自己的一切。有时落到敌人手里，什么问题也不讲，以免使党遭受损失。这种可歌可泣的高尚品质，永远会活在人民心里。给我们下一代播下了一颗幸福的种子，我们一定要用自己的双手勤劳地培养它。
        1957年12月19日　星期四
    从电影银幕上看到了祖国秀丽的河山：四季如春的云南；解放后建设起来的繁华的南昌（这是我们中国人民解放军诞生的地方）。我们青年战士应该高举“八一”军旗挺身前进，为完成人类解放的壮丽事业，把青春和一切献给祖国。
        1957年12月22日　星期日
    灰暗色的天边渐渐发白了，露出层层的红霞。大地的草木笑盈盈的，仿佛在向我们道着“早安！”我们一天的工作就在这时开始了。为人类创造幸福，保卫人民建设美丽的生活，这是我们一生的光荣。
        1958年2月13日　星期三
    看了“水”这部影片……困难和痛苦挡不住英雄们前进的道路。有党的力量，就能战胜任何困难，总有一日来到幸福跟前。
              ×月×日
    我要永远战斗在海岸上，它是我生死不可分离的土地。革命先烈的震动人心的英雄事迹，是我军宝贵的财产。我一定要向他们学习，立场坚定，像海边的青松。让党考验我，不管暴风雨多大，也吹不坏、浸不倒一个共产主义战士的信心……
              ×月×日
    人生总有一死，有的轻如鸿毛，有的却重如泰山。人民的英雄董存瑞、黄继光，为了战斗的胜利，挺身而出，生得伟大，死得光荣，他们受到了人民的尊敬，教育了无数活着的人，直到子孙万代。革命战士所以活着，只应该有一个目的，就是对人们有用。我们来前线惩罚敌人，胜利一定是我们的。但在战斗中如果遇到紧急关头，我一定勇往直前，毫不畏缩。
