Seize the Golden Season to Develop New Forest Areas

The second quarter is the golden season for developing new forest areas. Currently, most of the key new construction and expansion projects for developing new forest areas in various regions have commenced construction. As of the end of April, over 600 kilometers of forest roads have been built in various regions, over 470,000 cubic meters of river blasting projects have been completed, and 129 dams have been built.

More than 20 timber harvesting enterprises above the quota, newly built in my country's virgin forest areas, are stepping up the construction of roads and houses. In the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area of Inner Mongolia, the workers of the five newly built forestry bureaus of Jiwen, Jinhe, Alihe, Deerbul, and Niuerhe have completed the opening of forest road projects and are now building highways, forest railways, and earthwork projects. The three major forest areas of Jianfengling, Bawangling, and Diaoluoshan on Hainan Island in Guangdong Province are also being developed at an accelerated pace. The Jianfengling Forest Area, which combines construction and production, opened a 32-kilometer-long forest road that winds through steep and dangerous mountains on April 1st.

During the construction process, all regions have adopted self-reliance methods to vigorously develop the production of building materials. The forestry departments of Jilin Province are striving to basically achieve self-sufficiency in self-produced building materials and indigenous tools in the second quarter. In order to strengthen the leadership of raw material production management, the Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department has also assigned special personnel to be responsible for this work, and is striving to put cement, white ash, brick, and tile factories into production in the second quarter.

Under the leadership of the local Party committees, the relevant units responsible for the basic construction projects of developing new forest areas are mobilizing the masses of employees and doing everything possible to accelerate the construction process, in order to produce more timber to supply national construction as soon as possible. The workers fighting in the virgin forests are now launching a vigorous socialist labor competition and technological innovation movement. Operation teams such as Wuliyi Te, Douke River, and Kudumaer have used advanced tools such as wooden rail dump trucks and wooden axle carts, which have greatly improved construction efficiency, and the attendance rate of workers has reached 100%. The 401 work section of the Kailaqi Forest Farm of the Tulihe Forestry Bureau completed two months of road construction in twenty-five days in the high tide of competing with and surpassing advanced workers.

### 趁黄金季节　开发新林区

　　趁黄金季节　开发新林区
    第二季度，是开发新林区的黄金季节，目前，各地开发新林区的新建和扩建重点工程，大部动工兴建。截至4月底统计，各地已修林区公路六百多公里，完成河道炸焦工程四十七万多立方公尺，修筑闸坝一百二十九座。
    在我国原始森林区新建的二十多个限额以上的木材采伐企业，正在加紧修筑道路和房舍。内蒙古大兴安岭林区新建的吉文、金河、阿里河、得尔布尔和牛耳河等五个林业局的职工们开辟林道工程已经完成，正在修筑公路和森林铁路及土石方工程。广东省海南岛的尖峰岭、霸王岭、吊罗山等三大林区也正在加紧开发。边建设、边生产的尖峰岭林区，一条随着陡险的山势迂回曲折、长达三十二公里的森林公路，已在4月1日通车。
    在施工中，各地都采取自力更生的办法，大搞建筑材料的生产。吉林省林业部门自产的建筑材料和土工具，争取第二季度基本达到自给自足。黑龙江省林业厅为了加强对原材料生产管理的领导，还抽出了专人负责这方面工作，争取水泥、白灰、砖、瓦等工厂在第二季度投入生产。
    担负着开发新林区基本建设工程的各有关单位，正在当地党委的领导下，发动职工群众，千方百计加速建设进程，以求尽快生产更多的木材供应国家建设。战斗在原始森林的职工们，现在掀起了轰轰烈烈的社会主义劳动竞赛和技术革新运动。乌力依特、斗克河、库都马尔等作业队，使用了木轨翻斗车、木轴车等先进工具，大都提高了施工效率，工人的出勤率达到了百分之百。图里河林业局开拉气林场四零一工段，在比先进赶先进的竞赛高潮中，用二十五天完成了两个月的筑路工程量。
