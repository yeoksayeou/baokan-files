This newspaper reports from Shenyang on the 13th of May: The Paoziyan Brigade of the Taipingshao People's Commune in Kuan-dian County, Liaoning Province, is carrying out the "Ten Goods" commune member movement. Everyone is learning from and catching up with the advanced, and everyone is exerting their energy to strive for the upper reaches, resulting in a new atmosphere of "Five Mores": more outstanding commune members, more labor attendance, more creations and inventions, more new people and new things, and more time spent by cadres participating in production. This has vigorously promoted the production upsurge, making the brigade's spring ploughing and sowing fast and good.

    This brigade produced many advanced figures during the Great Leap Forward last year. The "Ten Goods" commune member movement was launched by summarizing the advanced deeds of these advanced figures, establishing role models, and setting standards. After evaluation by the commune members, thirty-one outstanding commune members were selected. They are all role models for everyone to learn from. For example, Zhang Yongxin, a female Communist Party member, goes to do whatever work is the most difficult. She was originally a production team leader, but seeing that there were many problems in the pig farm, she asked to work at the pig farm, and selected sixteen of the thinnest sows to raise. Half a year later, these pigs were all fat and pregnant. When building water conservancy projects, she worked even harder than some men. Once, she fell into an ice hole, her cotton pants were soaked, and her legs were so frozen that she couldn't bend them. Everyone advised her to rest, but she still insisted on working. After setting up some role models, the Party branch also mobilized the commune members to discuss: What does it mean to be a good commune member? Everyone put forward ten criteria: good at studying, politically and ideologically progressive; good at responding to the Party's call; good at obeying government laws and decrees; good at attending work on time and completing tasks; good at observing labor discipline and obeying leadership; good at technical innovation, creation and invention; good at cherishing public property, diligence and thrift; good at raising vigilance and "four preventions" work; good at eliminating the four pests and cleanliness and hygiene; good at mutual assistance and unity. Being "Ten Goods" means being a good commune member.

    After the conditions for good commune members were set, some people felt that this was just a formality. The Party knows who is good and who is bad, so what's the point of comparing? The Party branch first conducted a typical experiment to let everyone see the benefits of carrying out the good commune member movement with their own eyes. The pilot project was carried out in the third team. There was a commune member in this team named Wang Chengfu, who was rated as a good commune member last year and was a bit complacent. This time, he was rated as a "Nine Goods" commune member, and his younger brother Wang Chengdou was rated as a "Seven Goods" commune member, and kept saying that he wanted to surpass him. Wang Chengfu became anxious this time, his complacency was dispelled, and he worked even harder. Seeing this situation, everyone felt that it was beneficial to carry out the good commune member movement. Each team used "Ten Goods" as the standard, and the current production as the content, looking at ideology, action, and contribution, evaluating what they did, with the team making a small evaluation every ten days, a big evaluation every month, and a general evaluation at the end of the year. The brigade set up a book of honor to record the exemplary deeds of the commune members; the teams set up competition charts and honor rolls. Those who were rated as "Ten Goods" commune members again in the team were placed on the honor roll; those who were on the honor roll three times in a row were placed on the book of honor and given the title of "Ten Goods" outstanding commune member, and given material rewards. As a result, the "Ten Goods" commune member movement was carried out enthusiastically.

    In mid-April, the entire brigade conducted an evaluation, which greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the commune members, and everyone was refreshed, creating a more lively situation. In the fourth team, Tian Zengquan was rated as a "Ten Goods" commune member, and everyone took him as a role model to learn from. Commune member Li Shijia was not rated as "One Good," and he immediately made up his mind that he must become a "Ten Goods" commune member next time. From then on, he attended work every day, and volunteered to do whatever work was heavy. Jin Xianwen, a commune member of the third team, was not very enthusiastic during the Great Leap Forward last year; after carrying out the "Ten Goods" commune member movement, he put forward the slogan of learning from Qingfu and catching up with Qingfu (Jiang Qingfu is the "Ten Goods" commune member of this team), and strived towards the "Ten Goods" standard, and was rated as an "Eight Goods" commune member at the evaluation meeting. Old man Song Sanhao, who had been retired for several years, is now also supporting the plough. He said: "Liang Hao became a top scholar at the age of eighty-two, I am only seventy-two, so I can't be a Ten Goods commune member!" He ploughs steadily and carefully, and the young commune members all worship him as a teacher, praising him as "an old general going into battle, one is worth two."

### 人人争“十好”  处处见“五多”  定期评比推进增产节约  宽甸太平哨公社泡子沿大队春耕播种又快又好

    人人争“十好”  处处见“五多”
    定期评比推进增产节约
    宽甸太平哨公社泡子沿大队春耕播种又快又好
    本报沈阳13日电  辽宁省宽甸县太平哨人民公社泡子沿大队开展“十好”社员运动。人人学先进赶先进，个个鼓干劲争上游，出现了优秀社员多、劳动出勤多、创造发明多、新人新事多、干部参加生产时间多的“五多”新气象，有力地推动了生产高潮，使全队的春耕播种做得又快又好。
    这个队在去年大跃进中出现了很多先进人物。“十好”社员运动，就是通过总结这些先进人物的先进事迹，树标兵，定标准，然后开展起来的。经过社员评选，大家共选出三十一名优秀社员。他们都是大家学习的榜样。如女共产党员张永新，什么工作最艰苦，她就去干什么。她原来是个生产队长，看到养猪场问题多，就要求上猪场工作，选了十六头最瘦的母猪归她饲养。半年以后，这些猪都肥了，怀了胎。兴修水利的时候，她比一些男人干得还欢。有一回，掉到冰窟窿里去了，棉裤湿透，腿冻得打不了弯，大家劝她休息，她仍然坚持着干。把一些标兵树立起来以后，党支部又发动社员讨论：怎样才能算个好社员？大家摆出了十条标准：学习、政治、思想进步好；响应党的号召好；遵守政府法令好；按时出勤完成任务好；遵守劳动纪律、服从领导好；革新技术、创造发明好；爱护公物、勤俭节约好；提高警惕、“四防”工作好；消灭四害、清洁卫生好；互济互助、团结友爱好。够这“十好”，就是好社员。
    好社员的条件订好以后，也有些人觉得：这不过是个形式，谁好谁坏，党知道就行，比不比有啥？党支部于是先作典型试验，让大家亲眼看看开展好社员运动的好处。试点是在第三小队进行的。这队有个社员叫王成富，去年曾被评为好社员，有点自满。这回被评为“九好”社员，他弟弟王成斗被评为“七好”社员，口口声声要赶过他。王成富这回着急了，自满情绪打消了，干活更加起劲了。大家看到这种情形，都觉得开展好社员运动有好处，各小队都以“十好”做标准，以当前生产为内容，看思想、看行动、看贡献，做什么评什么，小队十天一小评，一月一大评，年终总评。大队设光荣簿，记载社员模范事迹；小队设竞赛榜和光荣榜。在小队里再次被评为“十好”社员，就上光荣榜；连上三次光荣榜，就上光荣簿，并给予“十好”优秀社员称号，发给物质奖励。于是，“十好”社员运动便热烈地开展了。
    4月中旬，全大队进行了一次评比，大大鼓舞了社员的积极性，人人精神焕发，出现了更加生动活泼的局面。在第四小队，田增全被评为“十好”社员，大家都拿他当学习的榜样。社员李世家“一好”也没评上，他当场就下定决心，下次一定要当上“十好”社员。从这以后，天天出勤，什么活重就争着干什么。三小队社员金显文，去年大跃进时劲头不大；开展“十好”社员运动以后，他提出学庆福、赶庆福（姜庆福是这个队的“十好”社员）的口号，向着“十好”标准努力，在评比会上被评为“八好”社员。宋三好老汉，已经退休好几年了，现在也来撑犁了。他说：“梁灏八十二岁中状元，我才七十二就不能当十好社员啦！”他撑犁又稳又细，青年社员都拜他为师，夸他是“老将出马，一个顶俩”。
