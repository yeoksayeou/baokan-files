    Former Laotian Fighting Units and the Lao Patriotic Party

    Question: What kind of unit is the former Laotian fighting force that has recently been surrounded by troops sent by the Royal Lao Government? Why is it said that the Royal Lao Government's attack on it violates the Geneva Agreements on Laos? Also, could you briefly introduce the situation of the Lao Patriotic Party, which the Lao Royal Foreign Minister has threatened to declare illegal? Beijing Reader Zheng Meng
    Answer: The Laotian Fighting Units are a people's armed force organized by the Laotian people in the struggle against imperialism.
    Laos became a French colony in 1893. During World War II, Japanese imperialism occupied Laos. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the Laotian people seized power from the Japanese occupiers, declared independence, and established a provisional government of resistance, with Prince Souphanouvong serving as Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs. In March 1946, French colonialists re-invaded Laos, the provisional government of resistance was forced into exile in Thailand, and soon after dissolved. The Kingdom of Laos, under French "protection," was re-established. However, Laotian patriots led by Prince Souphanouvong retreated to the Laos-Vietnam border area, established the Lao Liberation Committee, and led the people to continue their armed struggle, establishing bases in many areas of Laos. At the end of 1949, the regular Laotian Fighting Units were established. In August 1950, the Laotian Resistance Government, headed by Prince Souphanouvong, was officially established. Under the leadership of the Resistance Government, the Laotian Fighting Units victoriously resisted the French colonialists supported by U.S. imperialism. By early 1954, the Laotian Fighting Units had liberated half of the country's territory, controlled the three provinces of Sam Neua, Phongsaly, and Attopeu, and established democratic regimes in many provinces across the country.
    After the Geneva Conference on Indochina reached an agreement in July 1954, the Laotian Fighting Units, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement, gathered in the two northeastern provinces of Laos, Sam Neua and Phongsaly, awaiting a political settlement. According to the Geneva Agreements, the Royal Lao Government and the Laotian Fighting Units should seek the peaceful reunification of Laos through negotiation. The two sides began holding talks as early as September 1954, but due to the obstruction and sabotage of the Lao Royal domestic reactionary forces, the negotiations were intermittent until an agreement was finally reached on November 2, 1957. Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, and Prince Souphanouvong of the Laotian Fighting Units issued a joint statement confirming that both sides agreed to establish a coalition government with the participation of the Laotian Fighting Units; the Laotian Fighting Units would merge with the Royal Lao Army on the principle of equal rights. As for guaranteeing the civil rights of the Laotian Fighting Units and former resistance personnel, there were clear provisions in the agreement between the two sides' political delegations as early as 1956.
    After the Royal Lao Government and the Laotian Fighting Units reached an agreement, U.S. imperialism and Laotian reactionary forces continued to obstruct the implementation of the agreement. In particular, after Phoui Sananikone came to power last August, the Royal Lao Government's persecution of former Laotian Fighting Units personnel has intensified.
    In order to split the former Laotian Fighting Units, the Sananikone government only incorporated part of the officers and soldiers of the former Laotian Fighting Units into the Royal Army, while the rest were expelled from the army. The officers and soldiers incorporated into the Royal Army were all demoted by one rank. This divisive and discriminatory policy, which violated the agreement between the two sides, was naturally difficult for the former Laotian Fighting Units to accept. On May 11 this year, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Lao Royal authorities, under the pretext of so-called "not accepting ranks" and "opposing superior commanders," ordered the two battalions of the former Laotian Fighting Units incorporated into the Royal Army to disarm and surrender within 24 hours, otherwise they would be "prosecuted for treason." At the same time, the Royal Lao Government sent troops and police to surround the residence of the leaders of the former Laotian Fighting Units in Vientiane, including Prince Souphanouvong, and massively arrested and placed under house arrest members of the Lao Patriotic Party, mainly composed of former Laotian Fighting Units, in many areas across the country.
    The Lao authorities' armed attack on the former Laotian Fighting Units is actually a conspiracy to completely eliminate the former Laotian Fighting Units and undermine peace in Indochina. This is not only a fundamental violation of its agreement with the Laotian Fighting Units, but also a complete abandonment of the Geneva Agreements on Laos.
    The Lao Patriotic Party was established in November 1957, and its predecessor was the political organization of the Laotian Fighting Units - the Lao Patriotic Front. The Lao Patriotic Party advocates uniting the people of the whole country, uniting all political parties in Laos that support a policy of peace and neutrality, supporting the coalition government, opposing foreign interference, and building Laos into a peaceful, democratic, independent, and unified country.
    According to the agreement reached between the Royal Lao Government and the former Laotian Fighting Units in November 1957, the Lao Patriotic Party, mainly composed of former Laotian Fighting Units and other patriots, has the right to conduct legitimate political activities in the Kingdom of Laos, like other political parties.
    However, after Sananikone came to power, he adopted a policy of excluding the Patriotic Party. Patriotic Party members were not only unable to participate in the cabinet, but were also excluded from governments and administrative departments at all levels. The Sananikone government also prohibited the Lao masses from interacting with Lao Patriotic Party members, prohibited people from reading the Patriotic Party's newspaper "Patriotic News," forced Patriotic Party members to withdraw from the party, and even arbitrarily arrested and killed them. Recently, Lao Royal Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya openly stated that the Royal Lao Government would declare the Patriotic Party illegal. This act of persecution by the Royal Lao Government is undoubtedly another serious violation of the Geneva Agreements and the agreement between the Royal Lao Government and the Laotian Fighting Units.

### 前寮国战斗部队和老挝爱国党

    前寮国战斗部队和老挝爱国党
    问：最近被老挝王国政府派军队包围的前寮国战斗部队是一支怎样的部队？为什么说，老挝王国政府对它的攻击是违反有关老挝的日内瓦协议的？又老挝王国外交大臣扬言要宣布为非法的老挝爱国党的情况，是否也请给简单介绍一下？　北京读者　郑萌
    答：寮国战斗部队是老挝人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中，组织起来的一支人民武装。
    老挝在1893年沦为法国殖民地，第二次世界大战期间，日本帝国主义占领了老挝。1945年日本投降后，老挝人民从日本占领者手中夺取了政权，宣布独立，成立了临时抗战政府，由苏发努冯亲王任国防兼外交大臣。1946年3月法国殖民者重又侵入老挝，临时抗战政府被迫流亡泰国，不久就宣告解散，受法国“保护”的老挝王国政府重新建立。但是由苏发努冯亲王率领的老挝爱国者退到老挝—越南边境地带，成立了寮国解放委员会，领导人民继续进行武装斗争，在老挝许多地区建立了根据地。1949年底，建立了正规的寮国战斗部队。1950年8月以苏发努冯亲王为首的寮国抗战政府正式成立。寮国战斗部队在抗战政府领导下，胜利地抗击得到美帝国主义支持的法国殖民者。到1954年初，寮国战斗部队已解放了全国一半的领土，控制着桑怒、丰沙里和阿速坡三个省份，并在全国许多省份建立了民主政权。
    1954年7月，有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议达成协议以后，寮国战斗部队按照协议的规定集结在老挝东北部的桑怒和丰沙里两省，等待政治解决。按照日内瓦协议的规定，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队应该通过协商的方式谋求老挝的和平统一。双方早从1954年9月就开始举行会谈，只是由于老挝王国内外反动势力的阻挠和破坏，谈判时断时续，直到1957年11月2日才最后达成协议。老挝王国政府首相富马亲王和寮国战斗部队苏发努冯亲王发表联合声明确定：双方同意成立有寮国战斗部队参加的联合政府；寮国战斗部队在权利平等的原则上同老挝王国军队合并。至于保障寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员的公民权利，则早在1956年双方政治代表团的协议中有明确规定。
    老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队达成协议以后，美帝国主义和老挝反动势力不断阻挠协议的执行。特别是去年8月培·萨纳尼空上台后，老挝王国政府对前寮国战斗部队人员的迫害活动更日益加紧。
    萨纳尼空政府为了分裂前寮国战斗部队，只把前寮国战斗部队的部分官兵并入王国军队，其余的人则逐出军队。编入王国军队的官兵，军衔一律降一级。这种违反双方协议的分裂和歧视政策，前寮国战斗部队自然难以接受。今年5月11日，老挝王国当局在美帝国主义的唆使下，假借所谓“不接受军衔”、“反对上级指挥官”等莫须有的罪名，勒令前寮国战斗部队并入王国军队的两个营于二十四小时内缴械投降，否则就要“按叛乱罪论处”。同时，老挝王国政府派遣军队和警察包围了在万象的前寮国战斗部队的领导人包括苏发努冯亲王在内的住宅，并在全国许多地区大肆逮捕和软禁主要由前寮国战斗部队组成的老挝爱国党的党员。
    老挝当局这种对前寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻的行为实际上是阴谋全部消灭前寮国战斗部队，破坏印度支那和平。这不仅是根本违反了它同寮国战斗部队之间的协议，也是对有关老挝的日内瓦协议的彻底毁弃。
    老挝爱国党是在1957年11月成立的，它的前身就是寮国战斗部队的政治组织——老挝爱国战线。老挝爱国党主张团结全国人民，团结老挝所有赞成和平中立政策的政党，拥护联合政府，反对外国干涉，把老挝建成一个和平、民主、独立和统一的国家。
    根据老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队在1957年11月达成的协议，主要由前寮国战斗部队和其他爱国人士组成的老挝爱国党，在老挝王国同其他政党一样，有权利进行合法的政治活动。
    但，萨纳尼空上台以后，采取了排斥爱国党的政策，爱国党人不但不能参加内阁，而被排斥于各级政府和行政部门之外。萨纳尼空政府并禁止老挝群众同老挝爱国党党员来往，禁止人民阅读爱国党机关报“爱国报”，强迫爱国党党员退党，甚至对他们横加逮捕和杀害。最近老挝王国外交大臣坎番·班雅公开表示老挝王国政府将宣布爱国党为非法。老挝王国政府的这种迫害行为，无疑是对日内瓦协议以及老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队之间的协议的又一严重破坏。
