    Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Mobilizes Masses for Airing Views and Debates
    Establishes a Quality Inspection System
    (Our dispatch) The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has launched a mass movement to vigorously improve product quality on the basis of continued high production. Because this movement correctly implemented the principle of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements, it not only improved the ideological awareness of the workers and masses and improved product quality, but also improved the product quality inspection system and improved the level of enterprise management.
    In February of this year, after the factory's leading cadres discovered product quality problems, they immediately launched a mass movement throughout the factory to improve product quality. The factory's leading cadres first made strict self-criticism, and used methods such as airing views and debates, big-character posters, small-group discussions, spot checks of products, holding exhibitions and report meetings, and organizing visits to users to arouse the attention of cadres and workers to quality issues. Then, they organized cadres and the masses to conduct a factory-wide debate on the issue of the inspection work system, so that everyone understood the importance of strengthening quality inspection work and the necessity of establishing an inspection system that combines the mass line and centralized leadership. Finally, based on the results of the debate, the current inspection work system was established.
    The main characteristics of the newly established inspection work system are: First, the combination of self-inspection, mutual inspection, and full-time inspection. That is, on the one hand, production workers conduct self-inspection, and relevant workers (including upper and lower processes, upper and lower shifts, and workers on neighboring machine tools) conduct mutual inspection; on the other hand, full-time inspectors conduct inspections. Second, inspection work is managed at different levels. The inspection section is responsible for the inspection of raw materials, finished products, and intermediate products across workshops, while workshop inspectors are responsible for spot checks of first pieces, key parts, component assembly, final assembly, and parts entering the warehouse. Workers in groups are responsible for the inspection of general parts processes. Third, inspection personnel are under dual leadership, being led by the inspection section in terms of business, and by the workshop in terms of administrative relations. The benefits of implementing this system are: First, through mass self-inspection and mutual inspection, it improves their sense of responsibility for quality and mobilizes their enthusiasm for improving quality; at the same time, each level is responsible for quality, and the strength of the factory's inspection section and workshop inspectors is focused on the main aspects, which can effectively supervise and promote quality. The new inspection system stipulates that when differences of opinion occur in the inspection of products, the principles for handling them are: production workers obey inspectors, inspectors obey production team leaders, production team leaders obey inspection team leaders, inspection team leaders obey workshop directors, workshop directors obey inspection section chiefs, and inspection section chiefs obey the factory director. In this way, on the one hand, production workers have the right to fully reflect their opinions through administrative organizations; inspection personnel also have the right to insist on their correct opinions and exercise their power at each level; and the final decision-making power belongs to the highest administrative leader; fully embodying the principle of democratic centralism.
    While improving the inspection system, the factory has also established other necessary rules and regulations. For example, rectifying the waste product reuse system, stipulating the ratio of inspection personnel to workers, and drawing a group of experienced veteran workers as inspectors, etc.
    In order to disseminate the experience of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, the Industry Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre meeting of more than 1,800 people on April 27. Zhang Lang, Secretary of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Plant, introduced the experience at the meeting. Ma Tianshui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also spoke at the meeting and gave important instructions on the current industrial production work.

    上海机床厂发动群众鸣放辩论
    订出一套质量检查制度
    本报讯  上海机床厂开展了一个在继续高产基础上大力提高产品质量的群众运动。由于这个运动正确贯彻了集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的原则，不仅提高了职工群众的思想觉悟，提高了产品质量，而且健全了产品质量检查制度，提高了企业管理水平。
    今年2月间，这个厂的领导干部发现了产品质量的问题以后，立即在全厂掀起了一个群众性的提高产品质量的运动。厂的领导干部首先作了严格的自我批评，并运用大鸣大放、大字报、小组漫谈、抽查产品、举办展览会、报告会、组织访问用户等方式，引起干部和职工对质量问题的重视。然后，又组织干部和群众就检查工作体制问题展开全厂性的辩论，使大家明确加强质量检查工作的重要性，以及建立一个群众路线和集中领导相结合的检查制度的必要性。最后根据辩论的结果，建立了现行的检查工作制度。
    新建立的检查工作的制度，主要特点是：第一，自检、互检和专职检查相结合。即一方面由生产工人自行检查，有关工人（包括上下道工序、上下交接班和邻近机床工人）相互检查；一方面由专职检查人员检查。第二，检查工作分级管理。检查科负责原材料、成品和跨车间的中间产品的检查，车间检查人员负责首件、关键零件、部件装配、总装配和入库零部件的抽查，小组工人负责一般零件工序的检查。第三，检查人员双重领导，在业务上属检查科领导，行政关系上属车间领导。实行这一体制的好处是：首先，通过群众自检、互检，提高了他们对质量的责任感，调动了他们对提高质量的积极性；同时，逐级对质量负责，厂的检查科和车间检查员的力量放在主要方面，可以有效地对质量起监督和推动作用。新的检查制度规定，当产品在检验中发生分歧意见，处理的原则是：生产工人服从检查员，检查员服从生产组长，生产组长服从检查组长，检查组长服从车间主任，车间主任服从检验科长，检验科长服从厂长。这样，一方面生产工人有权通过行政组织充分反映自己的意见；检验人员也有权坚持自己的正确意见，层层行使权力；而最后的决定权则属于行政的最高领导人；充分体现了民主集中制的原则。
    在改进检查制度的同时，这个工厂还建立了其他一些必要的规章制度。例如整顿废品回用制度，规定了检查人员和工人的比例，并抽出一批有经验的老工人当检查员，等等。
    为了传播上海机床厂的经验，中共上海市委工业部曾在4月27日召开了一千八百多人的干部会议，中共上海机床厂委员会书记兼厂长张浪在会上介绍了经验，中共上海市委员会书记处书记马天水也在会上讲了话，对当前的工业生产工作作了重要指示。
