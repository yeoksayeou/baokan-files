Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 26th: The Polish newspaper "Free Fighter" wrote in a commentary on the 26th that the People's Republic of Poland, which had made great contributions to the work of the International Commission for Indochina, cannot ignore the clear violation of the Geneva Accords by the government of the Kingdom of Laos.

The newspaper pointed out that the situation in Laos has become more serious. The pro-American Sananikone government unilaterally abandoned the Geneva Accords on February 11 this year, persecuted progressive forces domestically, and recently even used vicious methods to oppose the Lao fighting forces. At the same time, within a few months, Laos was transformed into an American military base. Under the guise of various "missions," many American military officers came to the country. They imported weapons into Laos and established military facilities. Since the first half of 1958, the International Commission in Laos has virtually ceased its activities, and the decision to suspend the Commission's activities violated Poland's views and the Geneva Accords.

The commentary said that the current development of the situation in Laos cannot but cause unease in Laos' neighboring countries. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has protested against the Sananikone government's failure to implement the Geneva Accords and demanded the restoration of the International Commission's activities in Laos. The People's Republic of Poland supports this demand.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 25th: The Polish newspaper "Peasant News" today published an article written by Ochachiko, entitled: "Laos - the Trojan Horse of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

The author wrote that the offensive of the reactionary dictatorial regimes, which has been continuing in Asia for some time, has created a dangerous atmosphere in Indochina. Not long ago, Laos participated in the measures taken by the South Vietnamese government that threatened the cause of peace. Sananikone, a representative of the extreme right-wing forces in Laos, came to power last August. Not only the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but even neutral Cambodia has become the target of attacks and provocations. Such provocations risk re-igniting military conflict.

The author pointed out that in February this year, the government of the Kingdom of Laos kicked aside the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue and refused to allow the International Commission to carry out its due activities. Subsequently, the government of the Kingdom of Laos set about eliminating patriotic forces in the country. However, the Geneva Accords and the 1957 agreement between the Lao fighting forces and the Kingdom government guaranteed freedom of political action in Laos.

The author, commenting on the Sananikone regime's reactionary measures at home, wrote that these measures were to prepare for a more serious action.

The author cited many facts to prove that the United States opposed the Geneva Accords both during and after the Geneva Conference and obstructed the implementation of the agreement. The author went on to write that it could be said that seizing Indochina and tearing up the Geneva Accords were among the purposes of the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Five years later, Laos became the Trojan horse of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Indochina.

    波兰报纸谴责老挝亲美政府背弃协议
    波兰对老挝局势不能置之不理
    支持在老挝恢复国际委员会的活动
    新华社华沙26日电  波兰“自由战士报”26日在一篇评论中写道，曾经对印度支那国际委员会的工作做出巨大贡献的波兰人民共和国，对老挝王国政府明显地违背日内瓦协议的行为，不能置之不理。
    这家报纸指出，老挝的局势变得更加严重了。亲美的萨纳尼空政府在今年2月11日单方面废弃了日内瓦协议，在国内迫害进步力量，而最近竟用毒辣的手段反对寮国战斗部队。同时在几个月之内，老挝便变成了美国军事基地。在各种“使团”的掩饰下，很多美国军官来到了这个国家。他们向老挝输入武器并建立军事设施。自1958年上半年起，国际委员会在老挝实际上停止了活动，采取停止委员会活动的决定违反了波兰的观点和日内瓦协议。
    评论说，现在老挝局势的发展，不能不引起老挝邻国的不安。越南民主共和国政府就萨纳尼空政府没有执行日内瓦协议提出了抗议，并要求在老挝恢复国际委员会的活动。波兰人民共和国支持这个要求。
    新华社华沙25日电  波兰“农民报”今天发表了奥察乞科写的一篇文章，题目是：“老挝——东南亚条约组织的特洛伊木马”。
    作者写道，从某个时候起就在亚洲继续进行的反动独裁政权的进攻，在印度支那造成了危险的气氛。不久前，老挝参与了南越政府威胁和平事业的措施。老挝极右势力的代表——萨纳尼空于去年8月上台执政。不仅越南民主共和国，就连中立的柬埔寨也成了进攻和挑衅的对象。这种挑衅有重新挑起军事冲突的危险。
    作者指出，今年2月，老挝王国政府把1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议一脚踢开，并拒绝国际委员会进行应有的活动。随后，老挝王国政府着手消灭国内的爱国力量。而日内瓦协议和1957年寮国战斗部队和王国政府的协议都保证在老挝有政治行动自由。
    作者在评论萨纳尼空政权在国内的反动措施时写道，这些措施都是为了准备一次更严重的行动。
    作者引证许多事实，证明美国在日内瓦会议期间和在会议之后都反对日内瓦协议，并且阻挠这个协议的实行。作者接着写道，可以说，强占印度支那和撕毁日内瓦协议是东南亚条约组织成立时的目的之一。五年后，老挝成了东南亚条约组织在印度支那的特洛伊木马。
