Comrades,

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward, great changes, and great victories. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the general line for socialist construction, our people, in order to change our state of poverty and backwardness, displayed soaring revolutionary zeal and created unprecedented feats. In that year, in our Gansu, as in all parts of the country, industrial production greatly increased, agriculture reaped a bumper harvest, construction greatly developed, and the struggle to transform nature achieved great victories. For example, in the arid central region, we began to build a mountain canal - the Yintao Mountain Water Conservancy Project; on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, we built the Liujiaxia and Yangouxia Hydropower Stations; in the Hexi Corridor, we created a green Great Wall to prevent wind and sand; and in Huajialing, we carried out large-scale soil and water conservation. The people of the former Yongjing County built a heroic canal to divert the Yellow River for irrigation on cliffs and precipices; the people of Wen County built the most difficult section of the Yinping Ancient Road - the highway from Wen County to Bikou. There are such examples all over the country. This is a glorious undertaking that our predecessors have never done. Undoubtedly, the great year of 1958 will be forever recorded in the annals of our country with its brilliant achievements.

Last Year's Great Leap Forward, This Year's Continued Great Leap Forward

After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the general line for socialist construction and the policy of "walking on two legs" have taken root in the hearts of the people and are exerting inexhaustible strength; the people's confidence in changing the state of poverty and backwardness is even higher, and their enthusiasm is even greater; the material base and technical strength of socialism have been greatly enhanced; the vast number of cadres have received great training, and have a deeper understanding of the Marxist dialectical method, the working method of the mass line, the increasingly detailed economic work, and the spirit of the whole country as a single chess game, and have gained rich experience. In particular, the great people's communes have emerged and are being consolidated and developed, and their superiority is being increasingly demonstrated. All this shows that on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it is entirely possible to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

The emergence of the people's communes is a great change in our country's social system. In our Gansu, whether in agricultural or pastoral areas, the people's communes have been realized. There are currently 548 people's communes of varying sizes in the province. From last autumn to now, I have gone to the countryside several times to inspect work. Many people told me personally that the people's communes have brought them countless benefits, and their love for the people's communes is naturally revealed in their words. In particular, the vast number of working women who have been liberated from heavy housework are beaming with joy. Last National Day, I was in Dunhuang, and the masses warmly celebrated National Day, celebrated the bumper harvest, and celebrated the establishment of the people's communes. It was truly "triple happiness." Men, women, old and young, were all dressed in new clothes and filled with joy. I visited several commune members' families, public canteens, homes for the elderly, and nurseries, and everywhere was a scene of joy and happiness. In the people's communes, people love and cooperate, unite to produce, and the relationship between each other has changed greatly, and the spirit of collectivism has been further enhanced. Before this Congress, I went to the Pingliang area to inspect. The people's communes there, after several months of rectification and construction work, have been further consolidated. The principles of unified leadership, decentralized management, decentralized accounting, democratic commune management, and diligent and thrifty commune management have been better implemented. The enthusiasm of the communes, management areas (production brigades), production teams, work teams, and commune members has been given fuller play. This year's spring plowing production is faster and of higher quality. The masses are full of enthusiasm and confidence. They believe that with the people's communes, a greater harvest this year is even more guaranteed. The people's deep love for the people's communes is precisely a demonstration of the unparalleled superiority and great vitality of the people's communes. Despite the various malicious slanders of Dulles and his ilk against our country's Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, it will not affect our progress in the slightest, and can only further expose their stupidity and ignorance. The noble feelings of the Chinese people, who have stood up and are working selflessly to create their own beautiful life, will never be understood by the bloodthirsty imperialists.

I was born in the year of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, and it can be said that I was born in adversity. In the past, I only read about the so-called peaceful and prosperous era in books, and the decades of life before liberation were spent in internal and external troubles. Since liberation, seeing our country becoming stronger and stronger day by day, and our people becoming happier and happier day by day, especially seeing such an unprecedented Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement last year, I deeply feel that I am in such a great new era, which cannot be compared with any peaceful and prosperous era in history. I often think: the same land, the same people, suffered in the past, and are thriving today. The fundamental reason is none other than that today we have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we have the socialist system. I am glad that I have finally seen a bright new China, and I am even more glad that our young generation and even future generations will never suffer the same painful situation as we did in the past. It is precisely because of this that I feel particularly angry and hateful towards the crimes of the Tibetan reactionaries colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries to launch a rebellion. I resolutely support the Central People's Government in thoroughly suppressing the Tibetan rebellion, safeguarding the unity of the motherland and the unity of the nationalities, and crushing the evil conspiracies of foreign aggressors and Tibetan rebels.

Gansu Tibetan People Have Entered Socialism

The Tibetan people's urgent desire for social reform is fully understood and deeply sympathized with by the people of all nationalities in our Gansu. Because we deeply know how deep the suffering the barbaric and dark feudal serf system has brought to the Tibetan people for generations. In the Tibetan areas of Gansu, the Tibetan people used to live a slave life under the oppression of feudal privileges and the exploitation system. The feudal reactionary forces exploited the masses to the point of sucking their marrow. Almost all of the masses' annual labor income was seized by them, and they also had to pay a large amount of unpaid labor and support various errands. Even more appalling is that they used their privileges to set up private criminal courts, manufacture instruments of torture, and arbitrarily persecute the masses with more than 250 kinds of punishments such as whipping, cutting off noses, gouging out eyes, tearing out hearts, drawing out intestines, riding copper horses, wearing iron clothes, and cutting off tendons. As for arbitrarily extorting money, raping women, it was even more common. This dark system was really a mountain weighing on the heads of the Tibetan people. May I ask, if it is not overthrown, how can the Tibetan people completely turn themselves over, how can they develop production, how can they embark on the road of prosperity and progress? Obviously, it is absolutely impossible. Due to the unanimous demands of the Tibetan people and the approval of Tibetan patriotic people, the feudal exploitation system was completely abolished and feudal privileges were abolished in these areas in 1958, and the Tibetan people truly saw the blue sky after clearing away the dark clouds. On the basis of completing social reform, the Tibetan areas of Gansu quickly realized the people's commune, and entered socialism in one step. When the people's commune was established, the Tibetan people were overjoyed, riding horses to report the good news, congratulating each other, singing and dancing. They enthusiastically sang: "The phoenix is spreading its wings, how can the hundred birds not fly; the people's commune is established, how can we not sing; thousands of joyful hearts are like brilliant colorful clouds; thousands of smiling faces are like a sea of flowers; brilliant colorful clouds, bright flowers, all dedicated to Chairman Mao, all dedicated to the Communist Party." This earth-shaking change is precisely what the Tibetan people have been looking forward to day and night for many years. The feudal serf system in Tibet is even more cruel and barbaric than in the Tibetan areas of Gansu. The will of more than 1.1 million Tibetan people to completely turn themselves over cannot be stopped by a small handful of reactionaries. This is exactly the case. With the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, the social reform in Tibet will surely be smoothly realized, the root of the Tibetan people's poverty and suffering will be forever eradicated, and the sunshine of happiness will forever shine on Tibet.

The towering crimes of the Tibetan rebels betraying the motherland and betraying their own nation have been revealed to the world. The two so-called "statements by the Dalai Lama" do nothing to help the rebels exonerate themselves. On the contrary, they are just burying their heads in the sand, trying to cover up their guilt. In particular, the Dalai Lama confirmed to Prime Minister Nehru that the three letters he wrote to General Tan Guansan were true. This fact stripped the excuses of the Tibetan rebels and the Indian interventionists who were stirring up trouble, leaving them in complete bankruptcy. Recently, the actions of Indian interventionists and some Indian politicians interfering in our country's internal affairs have become increasingly rampant, and have even developed to the point where the Indian police authorities have actually condoned a small group of rioters to openly insult the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, which is truly unbearable and makes us extremely indignant! The Indian interventionists have been blinded by greed to the extreme. They regard our benevolence and righteousness and our broad mind that values Sino-Indian friendship as weak and easy to bully, and vainly attempt to exert pressure on us. This is simply daydreaming and overestimating their abilities! We solemnly warn those interventionists that the Chinese people's patience is limited. Tibet will always be China's Tibet. We will never allow our territory to be invaded by foreigners, and we will never allow our internal affairs to be interfered with by foreigners. The Chinese people have never been stingy with their strength in fighting back against all foreign interventionists. You should not misjudge the situation. The attempt to inherit the mantle of British imperialism is doomed to failure. Your behavior is not only resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, but also by the Indian people and far-sighted people, as well as the unanimous opposition of fair world opinion. Your behavior can only benefit imperialism. If you don't want to end up in disgrace, then please listen to the voice of people's justice and quickly put away your ambitions!

　　掀倒压在藏族人民头上的大山
    邓宝珊代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    一九五八年是大跃进、大变化、大胜利的一年。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在社会主义建设总路线照耀下，我国人民为了改变一穷二白的状况，发扬了冲天的革命干劲，创造了史无前例的丰功伟绩。这一年，在我们甘肃，同全国各地一样，工业大增产，农业大丰收，建设大发展，改造自然的斗争获得了巨大的胜利。举例来说，我们在中部干旱地区，开始兴建一条山上运河——引洮上山水利工程；在黄河上游，兴建刘家峡、盐锅峡水电站；在河西走廊，营造防风防沙的绿色长城；在华家岭，开展大规模的水土保持。原永靖县人民在悬崖绝壁上修成了引黄河灌溉的英雄渠；文县人民修通了阴平古道最艰险的一段——文县到碧口的公路。这样的事例，全国各地都有，这是我们前人从来没有做过的光荣事业。无疑的，伟大的一九五八年，将以它辉煌的成就而永远载入我国的史册。
    去年大跃进今年继续大跃进
  　经过一九五八年的大跃进，社会主义建设总路线和几个并举以及一整套用两条腿走路的方针，已经深入了人心，发挥出无穷无尽的力量；人民群众改变一穷二白状况的信心更高了，干劲更大了；社会主义的物质基础和技术力量大大地增强了；广大干部受到了很大的锻炼，对于马克思主义的辩证方法，群众路线的工作方法，经济工作愈作愈细和全国一盘棋的精神，体会得更深刻了，而且有了丰富的经验。特别是伟大的人民公社已经出现，正在日益巩固和发展，它的优越性正在日益充分地显示出来。这一切表明，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，争取一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进，是完全可能的。
    人民公社的出现，是我国社会制度的伟大变革。在我们甘肃，不论农业区或者牧业区，都已经实现人民公社化。全省现有五百四十八个规模不等的人民公社。从去年秋季到现在，我曾经几次下乡视察工作。许多群众亲口告诉我，人民公社给他们带来了数不尽的好处，言辞之间很自然地流露出对人民公社的热爱。特别是从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来的广大劳动妇女，更是笑逐颜开。去年国庆节，我正在敦煌，群众热烈庆祝国庆，庆祝大丰收，庆祝人民公社成立，真是“三喜临门”。男女老幼都穿新衣，喜气洋洋。我访问了几个社员家庭、公共食堂、敬老院、托儿所，到处都是欢乐幸福的景象。在人民公社里，人们友爱合作、团结生产，相互关系起了很大变化，集体主义精神更加提高了。在这次代表大会之前，我又到平凉地区去视察。那里的人民公社，经过几个月的整顿和建设工作，已经进一步巩固起来。统一领导、分级管理、分级核算、民主办社、勤俭办社的方针，是贯彻得更好了。公社、管理区（生产大队）、生产队、作业小队和社员群众的积极性发挥得更加充分了。今年的春耕生产，时间更快，质量更高。群众干劲十足，信心充沛，他们认为，有了人民公社，今年更大的丰收就更加有了保证。人民群众对于人民公社的深情热爱，正是说明了人民公社的无比优越性和伟大生命力。尽管杜勒斯之流对我国大跃进和人民公社进行种种恶毒的污蔑，丝毫不会影响我们前进的步伐，只能更加暴露他们的愚蠢和无知。站起来的中国人民为了创造自己美好生活而进行忘我劳动的崇高情感，对于渴血的帝国主义者来说，是永远不会懂得的。
    我是甲午之战那一年出生的，可以说是生于忧患。历史上所谓太平盛世，过去我只在书本上看过，而解放前的几十年生活，都是在内忧外患中度过的。解放以来，看到我们的国家一天天强大，我们的人民一天天幸福，特别是看到去年这样史无前例的大跃进和人民公社化运动，我深深感到自己处在一个何等伟大的新时代，这是历史上任何太平盛世所无法比拟的。我常想：同样的土地，同样的人民，过去受苦受难，今天欣欣向荣，根本道理，不是别的，而是由于今天我们有了中国共产党和毛主席的领导，有了社会主义制度。我欣幸自己终于看到了一个光芒万丈的新中国，更欣幸我们年青的一代以至子孙万代永远不会再遭到像我们过去那样痛苦的境遇。正是因为这样，我对于西藏反动分子勾结帝国主义和外国反动派发动叛乱的罪行，就格外感到愤怒和痛恨。我坚决拥护中央人民政府彻底平息西藏叛乱，维护祖国统一和民族团结，粉碎外国侵略者和西藏叛乱分子的罪恶阴谋。
    甘肃藏族人民进入了社会主义
    西藏人民迫切要求进行社会改革的愿望，我们甘肃各民族人民是完全理解并深切同情的。因为我们深深知道，野蛮黑暗的封建农奴制度，给藏族人民世世代代带来了多么深重的苦难。在甘肃藏族地区，藏族人民过去在封建特权和剥削制度的压迫下，过着奴隶的生活。封建反动势力，对群众的剥削，真是到了敲骨及髓的地步。群众终年劳动所得，几乎全部被他们攫去，而且还要付出大量的无偿劳动和支应种种差役。更令人发指的是，他们利用特权，私设刑庭，制造刑具，用鞭打、割鼻、挖眼、掏心、抽肠、骑铜马、穿铁衣、割脚筋等二百五十多种刑罚，任意残害群众，至于随便敲诈勒索，奸淫妇女，更是常见的事情了。这种暗无天日的制度，真是压在藏族人民头上的大山。试问，不把它掀倒，藏族人民怎能彻底翻身，怎能发展生产，怎能走上繁荣进步的道路？显然，无论如何也是不行的。由于藏族人民的一致要求和藏族爱国人士的赞同，一九五八年，在这些地区彻底废除了封建剥削制度，取消了封建特权，藏族人民真如拨开了乌云见青天。在完成社会改革的基础上，甘肃藏族地区很快实现了人民公社化，一步进入了社会主义。人民公社成立的时候，藏族人民欣喜若狂，骑马报喜，互相祝贺，载歌载舞。他们热情地歌唱：“凤凰展翅了，百鸟怎能不飞翔；人民公社成立了，我们怎能不歌唱；千万颗喜悦的心，像灿烂的彩云；千万个欢笑的脸，像鲜花的海洋；灿烂的彩云，鲜艳的花朵，一齐献给毛主席，一齐献给共产党。”这个翻天复地的变化，正是藏族人民多少年来日夜盼望的。西藏的封建农奴制度，比之甘肃藏族地区，其残酷野蛮的程度有过之无不及。一百一十几万西藏人民要求彻底翻身的意志，决不是一小撮反动分子所能阻挡得住的。事情正是这样，随着西藏叛乱的平息，西藏的社会改革一定会顺利实现，西藏人民贫困痛苦的根源将永远拔除，幸福的阳光将永远普照着西藏。
    西藏叛乱分子背叛祖国背叛本民族的滔天罪行，已经大白于天下。两个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，丝毫无助于叛乱分子开脱自己的罪责，相反的，只是掩耳盗铃，欲盖弥彰。特别是达赖喇嘛向尼赫鲁总理证实他写给谭冠三将军的三封信是真的。这个事实，把西藏叛乱分子和兴风作浪的印度干涉主义分子的借口剥得干干净净，使他们陷于彻头彻尾的破产。最近，印度干涉主义分子和印度某些政治家干涉我国内政的行为，是越来越猖狂了，甚至发展到印度警察当局竟纵容一小撮暴徒公然侮辱我们伟大领袖毛主席的像，真使我们忍无可忍，万分愤慨！印度干涉主义分子利令智昏已经达于极点。他们把我们仁至义尽以中印友谊为重的宽大胸怀，看成是软弱可欺，妄图对我施加压力。这简直是白日作梦，不自量力！我们严正警告那些干涉者们，中国人民的忍耐是有限度的。西藏永远是中国的西藏。我们决不容许自己的领土受到外人侵犯，决不容许我们的内政受到外人干涉。对于反击一切外国干涉者，中国人民是从来也不吝惜自己力量的。你们不要把形势估计错了。想继承英帝国主义的衣钵，是注定要失败的。你们这种行为，不但遭到中国人民的坚决反对，也遭到印度人民和有远见的人士以及全世界公正舆论的一致反对。你们这种行为，只能对帝国主义有利。如果你们不想得到身败名裂的下场，那么，就请听一听人民正义的声音，赶快收起你们的野心吧！
