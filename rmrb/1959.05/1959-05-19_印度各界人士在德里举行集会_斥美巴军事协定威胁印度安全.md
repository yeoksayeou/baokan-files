Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 18th: Indian people held a rally at the Old Delhi Municipal Hall here on the evening of the 17th, marking a day against the US-Pakistan military agreement. It was organized by the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee.

    The public gathering, attended by many people, passed a resolution strongly condemning the US-Pakistan military agreement. The resolution said that this agreement "is an ominous threat to India's national security and independence."

    The resolution called on the US government to cancel "this dangerous policy and abrogate this agreement and other treaties." The resolution called on the progressive and liberal forces in the United States to mobilize public opinion in their country to oppose these treaties. The resolution said that the Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee opposes all types of treaties, but the aforementioned treaty is of the most direct concern to the Indian people.

    The meeting passed a resolution extending fraternal respect to the people of Pakistan, and expressed the hope that the Karachi government would soon realize that military treaties are worthless and that they are a threat to the security of India and other Asian countries.

    Mrs. Rameshvari Nehru, the chairman of the meeting, said that the US-Pakistan military agreement has brought the "cold war" to India's doorstep. She pointed out that American diplomats have been saying that the military "aid" provided to Pakistan will not be used against India, but those who control the fate of Pakistan say that they can use this "aid" in any way they like.

    Ahmed Saeed, the leader of the Indian Islamic Teachers Organization, said that the US-Pakistan military agreement "will prove to be a disaster for Pakistan, the United States, and world peace." The recently signed US-Pakistan military agreement will one day prove to be Pakistan's noose.

    Also speaking were: Member of Parliament Brahm Prakash, editor of "Unity News" Ranbir Singh, and Secretary of the Delhi State Committee of the Communist Party of India, Farooqi. They all strongly condemned the aggressive plans of the United States, and expressed the hope that the Pakistani government would recognize the consequences of this agreement, thereby abolishing it to maintain its peaceful relations with India.

    印度各界人士在德里举行集会
    斥美巴军事协定威胁印度安全
    新华社新德里18日电　印度人民17日晚间在这里的旧德里市政大厅集会，举行反对美巴军事协定日。这是印度亚非团结委员会组织的。
    这个有很多人参加的公众大会通过决议，严厉谴责美巴军事协定。决议说，这个协定“是对印度国家安全和独立的一个预示不祥的威胁”。
    决议要求美国政府取消“这种危险的政策和废除这个协定以及其它条约”。决议号召美国的进步自由力量动员它们国内的舆论来反对这些条约。决议说，印度亚非团结委员会反对各种类型的条约，但是，上述条约对于印度人民来说关系最为直接。
    会议通过决议向巴基斯坦人民致以兄弟般的敬意，并且表示希望，卡拉奇政府不久将认识到，军事条约是毫无价值的，它是对印度和其它亚洲国家安全的威胁。
    会议主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人说，美巴军事协定已经把“冷战”带到印度的大门口。她指出，美国外交官员一直说，为巴基斯坦提供的军事“援助”将不用来反对印度，但是掌握巴基斯坦命运的人却说，他们可以以他们喜欢的任何方式使用这种“援助”。
    印度伊斯兰教师组织领袖艾哈迈德·赛义德说，美巴军事协定“将会证明是对巴基斯坦、美国和世界和平的灾难”，最近签订的美巴军事协定总有一天会证明是巴基斯坦的绞索。
    发言的还有：议员布腊姆·普腊卡什、“团结报”编辑兰比尔·辛格、印度共产党德里邦委员会书记法鲁基。他们都严厉谴责美国的侵略计划，并且希望，巴基斯坦政府将认识到这项协定的后果，从而废除这项协定以保持它同印度的和平关系。
