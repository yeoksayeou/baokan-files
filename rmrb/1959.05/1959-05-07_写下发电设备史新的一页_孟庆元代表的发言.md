Comrades of the presidium, fellow delegates:

I fully endorse and agree with the government work report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the report on the draft national economic plan for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Regarding the Tibet issue, I fully support the policies and measures adopted by the Central Government. Now, with the enthusiastic support of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have quickly quelled the rebellion, and the enemy has once again suffered a shameful defeat. Here, I would like to pay tribute to the brave and loyal People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet. We resolutely oppose any slander, defamation, and malicious conspiracies by imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. We solemnly warn you that any rash action will only accelerate your own demise. The suffering life of the Tibetan people is about to end forever. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all ethnic groups in China will unite even more closely in the future, and the Tibetan people will also join hands with the people of the whole country on the bright road of socialism.

The proposal of a plan for a greater leap forward in the national economy in 1959, based on the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, is extremely inspiring. I believe that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the efforts of the people of the whole country, this grand plan will definitely be successfully and overfulfilled.

I am a motor manufacturing engineering technician. I have seen that the Shanghai Motor Factory where I work, like other enterprises, has developed rapidly in the past ten years, especially during the first five-year plan period and in 1958. Before liberation, this factory only made small motors and could not make thermal power generation equipment at all. Steam turbine generators are technically complex and highly precise. Capitalist countries have gone through more than sixty or seventy years of history in manufacturing steam turbine generators to reach today's level. However, after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, our factory completed the trial production of the first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in 1954, and in 1956, we completed the trial production of a 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator, laying the foundation for the manufacture of steam turbine generators. Because China has rapidly established and developed the power generation equipment manufacturing industry, hundreds of power stations have been produced and equipped during the first five-year plan period. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator unit was also successfully trial-produced. This year, we are developing towards 50,000 and 100,000 steam turbine generator units. It can be expected that in the near future, we can catch up with the level of capitalist countries.

Looking at the growth of our factory's total output value and output: In terms of total output value, taking 1952 as 100 percent, 1949 was 3.7 percent, 1957 was 262 percent, and 1958 was 733 percent. In terms of steam turbine generator output, taking 1954 as 1, 1949 was 0, 1952 was 0, 1957 was 20.8 times, and 1958 was 86.8 times. These growth figures reflect the achievements of our factory during the first five-year plan period and the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The main reason for the Great Leap Forward in 1958 was to strengthen the leadership of the Party after the rectification campaign, adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, and vigorously carry out technological revolution. Through the "three-in-one combination," not only did an unprecedented upsurge appear in production, and the leap forward targets were completed ahead of schedule, but at the same time, the direction of technological revolution developed from improving technology, tools, and equipment to a major revolution in product design.

In the past, in the national twelve-year scientific plan, our factory was included in the new type of steam turbine generator project, and we did some work in collecting data and analysis and research. At that time, it was only a few technicians working behind closed doors, and it was just a "grand ideal." It was even more "far away" when it would be realized. Our factory party committee promptly pointed out the direction, calling on technicians to cooperate closely with production workers and develop towards advanced, large-scale, and cutting-edge products. With the active support and care of the Party, the production workers and technicians of our factory cooperated closely to march towards cutting-edge technology. After a hundred days of hard work, we finally created the first new type of steam turbine generator, using the same materials, but increasing the power generation capacity by more than one time. This product revolution created a new record in the history of power generation equipment. Now this motor, with the support of the user unit, has been installed and is running in the power plant and has begun to transmit electricity. In the past, I went to study in British and American capitalist countries, and I saw that their industry was developed, and I believed in their technology. I thought that if they couldn't do it, why should we think about it? Under the brilliant light of the general line, the Party educated us to break superstitions, liberate our minds, overcome feelings of inferiority, and establish a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. Finally, we realized the great ideal of "we must have what others do not have" which we did not dare to think about before. The trial production of this generator was carried out collectively under the direct leadership of the Party from the beginning. Throughout the product processing process, we often received care and support from the leaders of the Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee, dispelling our ideological concerns and work difficulties. The Party Committee of our factory also mobilized all the forces of the factory to support this work and create conditions for the trial production. Under the leadership of the Party, various cooperative units, research institutions, and universities have all supported manpower and material resources, so that the glorious task can be successfully completed. Therefore, its completion should first be attributed to the leadership of the Party.

We were not smooth sailing when we explored the trial production of this new type of generator, but went through a process of repeated ideological struggles. At the beginning, many people lacked confidence and were skeptical. Once they encountered technical problems or some major parts needed to be reworked, they would have thoughts of fear of difficulty or even giving up the trial production. Only under the continuous education of the Party, eliminating these ideological obstacles, and overcoming numerous difficulties, could the trial production work be smoothly advanced. This motor adopts many new technologies and new structures, without any reference materials. There are many complex projects that are difficult to solve by relying solely on technicians. After mobilizing the masses to widely solicit opinions with big-character posters, we worked with the workers to study and solve them. There are also a few projects that individual engineers once wanted to create independently, working behind closed doors, but achieved nothing. Later, they had to show their cards and discuss with the workers before they could be solved. There are also some parts that, under the mutual inspiration of technicians and workers, decided to trial-produce several different structures and affirmed them after experiments. These all show that strengthening the combination of labor and technology and collective wisdom are infinite. During the trial production process, technicians followed the shift to work, combined with the workers at any time, and carried out on-site rectification. There are many such examples. In the shift work, technicians have a further understanding of the drawings and technology they designed, and it is also easy to find technical problems. After discussing with the workers, the product design is improved, and the product structure is becoming more and more perfect. After participating in labor, technicians realized that "the combination of labor and technology is infinite in wisdom, and it must be organized. Many technical problems can be solved. Relying on individuals is insignificant, and relying on a few people is also limited."

For example, last year, in the sound of taking steel as the key link, our factory faced the production task of metallurgical motors that exceeded its capacity by one time. If it was not completed, it would affect the ascension of the iron and steel marshal. After mobilizing the masses, the workshop workers proposed to change the copper row rotor of the largest batch of tasks, the 630-kilowatt high-speed motor, to vibration cast aluminum. According to existing data, the world's largest cast aluminum rotor is only 200 kilowatts. Such a large high-speed motor using a cast aluminum rotor has never been made before. At that time, some people thought it was very difficult. The workers said, "There must be difficulties in mastering cutting-edge technology, but they must be overcome." With the active support of the Party, technicians participated in drawing and helping research, casting aluminum workers studied casting methods, tool workers manufactured molds, and sand turning workers solved shrinkage problems. After everyone worked together, overcame various difficulties, and worked hard for eight days and nights, they finally mastered this technology, which not only guaranteed the completion of the task, but also saved eight tons of copper, six tons of steel, and saved more than 40,000 man-hours.

The above examples fully illustrate the victory of the three-in-one combination of leaders, workers, and technicians. We not only need workers to intervene in product design, but the more important the product, the more workers need to participate, so that workers' wisdom can be further developed in production. This effective form of workers' participation in new product design not only makes workers the masters of the product, but also more favorably leads the technological revolution to a higher stage.

1959 is the decisive year for three years of hard work, and it is also a year of greater leap forward. The foundation of China's motor manufacturing industry is relatively poor and is not commensurate with the development ratio of other industries. This year, the national power generation equipment task is 2.8 million to 3 million kilowatts, an increase of 250% to 275%. In the machinery manufacturing industry, the output has increased the most, which is necessary and appropriate. As a motor manufacturing engineering technician, this task is glorious and arduous, and it is close to the recent annual output of 3.5 million kilowatts of power generation equipment in the United Kingdom. We must strive to complete this glorious task. There are difficulties in completing such an arduous task. In the case of our factory, we used to use forgings, and there were more reserves, so it was possible to create the highest quarterly output of more than 220,000 kilowatts in the fourth quarter of last year. This year, the output has increased several times, and the supply of forgings is tight for a while, and it is used as it comes, so that the production capacity of the manufacturing plant has not been fully utilized. I believe that under the unified arrangement of the state, this supply situation will be gradually improved. At the same time, we must try every means to calculate carefully, save raw materials, and overcome difficulties. Even in the current situation of supply difficulties, the output of steam turbine generators in the first quarter of 1959 in our factory reached 126% of the total output in the first and second quarters of 1958, creating a good start for this year's Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party, based on the victory in 1958, I believe that our factory will be able to overfulfill the state's targets. At the same time, all the staff of our factory have full confidence and are prepared to meet the more tasks assigned by the state at any time. I understand that many fraternal units in China are actively engaged in the mass production of power generation equipment. I believe that with the joint efforts of all fraternal units and our factory, we will be able to overfulfill the glorious and arduous task of national power generation equipment this year.

As an engineering technician, in the past ten years, under the education and training of the Party, we have received good practical work training in the cause of socialist construction, and we deeply feel that now is the time for us to dedicate all our strength. At the same time, we especially feel that we still cannot meet the requirements of the Party and the country in terms of political ideology and technical level. In the future, I must continue to improve my ideological awareness and technical level, and work with the engineering technicians of the whole factory to go to the front line for training, go to the site for rectification, be of one heart with the workers, share the fate of production, constantly transform myself, establish the world outlook of the working class, and move towards the direction of being both red and expert, and wholeheartedly strive for socialist construction.

　　写下发电设备史新的一页
    孟庆元代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全拥护和同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告和彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。
    关于西藏问题，我完全拥护中央所采取的政策和措施。现在人民解放军驻西藏部队在藏族僧俗人民热烈支持下，已经迅速平息叛乱，敌人再一次地遭到可耻的失败。这里，我谨向忠勇的人民解放军驻西藏部队致敬。我们坚决反对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的任何诽谤诬蔑和恶毒阴谋，我们严正警告你们，任何轻举妄动只有加速你们自己的灭亡。西藏人民的苦难生活就要永远结束了，我们深信，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，中国各民族今后一定会更加紧密地团结在一起，西藏人民亦将和全国人民一样共同携手走上社会主义的光明大道。
    在一九五八年大跃进的胜利基础上，提出了一九五九年国民经济更大跃进的计划令人鼓舞万分，我相信在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下和全国人民努力下，这个宏伟计划，一定能够胜利地超额完成的。
    我是一个电机制造工程技术人员，我看到我所工作的上海电机厂与其他企业单位一样，十年来特别是在第一个五年计划期内和一九五八年有了飞跃的发展。解放前这个厂只做些小电机，火力发电设备根本不会做。汽轮发电机技术复杂，精密度高，资本主义国家制造汽轮发电机经过了六、七十年以上的历史，才有今日的水平。但是，解放以后我厂在党的正确领导下一九五四年试制完成第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机，一九五六年又试制完成一万二千瓩汽轮发电机，奠定了制造汽轮发电机的基础。由于我国迅速地建立和发展了发电设备制造业，在第一个五年计划期内就生产和配备了成百的电站。一九五八年大跃进的一年，又试制完成二万五千瓩汽轮发电机组，今年正向五万和十万的汽轮发电机组发展，可以预期在不久的将来，就可赶上资本主义国家的水平。
    再从我厂总产值和产量来看增长情况：总产值方面以一九五二年为百分之一百，一九四九年为百分之三点七，一九五七年为百分之二百六十二，一九五八年为百分之七百三十三，汽轮发电机产量方面以一九五四年为一，一九四九年为零，一九五二年为零，一九五七年为二十点八倍，一九五八年为八十六点八倍。这些增长数字反映了我厂在第一个五年计划期内和一九五八年大跃进的成就。一九五八年大跃进的主要原因是整风以后加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。通过三结合，不但在生产上出现了空前的高潮，提前完成了跃进指标，与此同时技术革命的方向由改进工艺、工具和设备方面，发展到大革产品设计之命。
    过去在国家十二年科学规划项目中，我厂曾列入新型汽轮发电机项目，做了一些收集资料和分析研究工作，当时不过只是少数技术人员关门搞的，而且仅仅是“远大理想”，何年何月实现更是“遥遥无期”。我厂党委及时指出方向，号召技术人员必须和生产工人密切合作，向高级的大型的尖端的产品方向发展。在党的积极支持和关怀下，我厂生产工人和技术人员密切合作向尖端技术进军，经过了苦战一百天，终于创造了第一台新型汽轮发电机，使用同样材料，却提高发电容量一倍以上。这项产品革命创造了发电设备史上的新纪录。现在这台电机在使用单位支持下，已在电厂安装运转，开始输送电力。以往我到过英美资本主义国家学习，看到他们工业发达，迷信他们技术，认为他们做不出的，我们何必多想。在总路线的光辉照耀下，党教育我们破除迷信，解放思想，克服自卑情绪，树立了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，终于由不敢想而实现了“人家没有的，我们亦要有”的伟大理想。这台发电机的试制工作一开始就在党的直接领导下集体进行的。在整个产品加工过程中，我们经常得到中央和市委领导的关怀和支持，解除我们思想上的顾虑和工作上的困难，我厂党委亦同样动员全厂一切力量来支持这项工作，为试制创造条件。在党的领导下，各协作单位，研究机构和高等学校等都支援人力和物力，这样就胜利地完成这项光荣的任务，因此它的完成首先应归功于党的领导。
    我们在摸索试制这一台新型发电机时并不是一帆风顺，而是经过反复的思想斗争过程。开始时有不少人信心不足，半信半疑，一旦遇到技术问题或是某些重大部件需要反工时，就产生畏难甚至放弃试制的思想，惟在党的不断教育下，扫除这些思想障碍，克服重重困难，试制工作才顺利地向前推进。这台电机采用很多新技术和新结构，都没有任何参考资料，有很多复杂的项目，单纯依靠技术人员很难解决，经过发动群众用大字报广泛征求意见，在我们与工人一起研究后，得到了解决；亦有少数项目，个别工程师曾想独自创造，闭门造车，一无所成，后来不得不摊牌，与工人讨论，才得到解决；还有一些部件，在技术人员和工人相互启发下，决定试制若干不同的结构，经过试验而肯定下来。这些都说明加强劳技结合，集体智慧是无穷的。在试制过程中，技术人员跟班劳动，随时与工人结合，进行现场整改，这样的例子亦是不少的。在跟班劳动中，使技术人员对所设计的图纸和工艺，有进一步的了解，亦就容易发现技术上的问题，与工人一起商量后，使产品设计得到改进，产品结构益趋完善。技术人员参加劳动后体会到“劳技结合，智慧无穷，又要组织起来，许多技术问题就能解决，单靠个人是渺小的，靠少数人亦是有限的。”
    又如我厂去年在以钢为纲声中面对着冶金电机的生产任务超过能力一倍，如果完不成，将影响钢铁元帅的升帐，经过发动群众，车间工人就提出了把最大一批任务，六百三十瓩高速电动机的铜排转子改为震动铸铝。照现有资料了解，世界上最大铸铝转只到二百瓩，这样大型采用铸铝转子的高速电机还没有过。当时有些人认为大有困难，工人说“掌握尖端技术一定有困难，但一定要克服”，在党的积极支持下，技术人员参加绘图和帮助研究，铸铝工人研究浇铸方法，工具工人制造模具，翻砂工人解决缩孔问题，经过大家同心协力，克服种种困难，苦战八昼夜，终于掌握这项技术，不仅保证完成了任务，还节约用铜八吨，钢材六吨，和节省四万多工时。
    通过上列事例充分地说明了领导、工人群众和技术人员三结合的胜利。我们不仅需要工人干预产品设计，并且愈是重大的产品，愈是需要工人参加，如此使工人的智慧在生产上得到进一步的发挥。这样工人参与新产品设计的有效形式，不仅仅工人做了产品的主人，并且更有利地把技术革命引向高级阶段。
    一九五九年是苦战三年的决定性一年，亦是跃进更大的一年。我国电机制造工业的底子是比较差的，与其他工业的发展比例不相适应，今年全国发电设备任务是二百八十至三百万瓩，增长百分之二百五十至二百七十五，在机械制造工业中，产量提高最多，这是必要而恰当的。作为一个电机制造工程技术人员来看，这个任务是光荣而艰巨的，已接近最近英国发电设备的年产量三百五十万瓩，我们一定要为完成这个光荣的任务而奋斗。欲完成这样艰巨的任务不是没有困难的，以我厂而言，以往使用锻件，有比较多的储备量，因而去年第四季度才有可能创造了超过二十二万瓩的最高季产量。今年起产量成倍地提高，一时锻件供应显得紧张，现来现用，以致制造厂生产能力未能充分发挥。我相信在国家统一安排下，一定会逐步地改善这种供应情况，同时我们亦要千方百计，精打细算，节约原材料，克服困难。即使在目前供应困难情况下，我厂一九五九年第一季度汽轮发电机的产量达到了一九五八年第一、二季度产量总和的百分之一百二十六，为今年大跃进创造了良好的开端。在党的领导下，在一九五八年胜利基础上我相信我厂一定能够超额完成国家指标的。同时我厂全体职工有充分信心，准备随时迎接国家交给更多的任务。我了解国内有很多兄弟单位都在积极从事大量生产发电设备，我相信在各兄弟单位和我厂共同努力下一定能够超额完成今年全国发电设备的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    作为一个工程技术人员来谈，十年来在党的教育和培养下，我们在社会主义建设事业中得到了很好的实际工作的锻炼，深深体会到当前正是我们献出自己一切力量的时候，同时特别感觉到在政治思想上和技术水平都还不能满足党和国家的要求。今后我一定要继续提高自己思想觉悟和技术水平，同全厂工程技术人员一起上火线锻炼，下现场整改，与工人心连心，同生产共命运，不断改造自己，建立工人阶级的世界观，向着又红又专的方向前进，全心全意为社会主义建设而努力。
