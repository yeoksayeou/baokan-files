An Example
——Thoughts on Reading Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia"
Chi Liaozhou

"The Development of Capitalism in Russia" is an outstanding Marxist economic theory work written by Lenin sixty years ago.

Lenin worked on this book for more than three years. During his exile, under extremely difficult conditions, he exhausted every means to collect all the materials he needed. After completing each chapter, it was read and discussed by Social Democrats who were exiled with him at the time. Even after the book was published, he constantly added many supplements to the new edition based on newer materials. What impresses anyone who has read this book is the incredibly rich statistical material that Lenin cited. In order to study the process of peasants differentiating into rural bourgeoisie and proletariat, Lenin especially utilized the statistical materials of the Russian local self-government bureaus. However, the statisticians of those local self-government bureaus at the time often compiled the statistical materials with prejudice, classifying them incorrectly, which greatly reduced their value. This forced Lenin to examine and sort out these statistical materials very carefully, and to recalculate and create charts himself, giving these figures scientific classification and Marxist analysis, thereby depicting a true and vivid picture of Russia's economic development.

When answering the Populists' criticism of some of his statistical materials, Lenin said:

"How can the problem be solved without statistical materials? -- This secret was not revealed by the severe critic, so I continue to insist on the following opinion: I would rather bear the charge of tedious narration than make the reader think that my point of view is based on ‘citations’ from ‘Capital,’ rather than on the study of Russian statistical materials."

Of course, it is not to say that any pile of numbers has its important significance. Not only do some statistical figures need to be carefully examined and verified, but, in order to truly explain the problem and draw conclusions that conform to objective laws, long-term statistical materials are also necessary. Lenin repeatedly emphasized this point. For example, he pointed out that the development of capitalist industry can only proceed cyclically. Therefore, to compare different periods, it is necessary to adopt statistical materials from many years in order to distinguish between years of special prosperity, upswing, and decline. For example, Lenin studied the grain production of European Russia, but due to the huge fluctuations in harvests at the time, the statistical materials for individual periods or individual years were completely useless. For this reason, he specifically pointed out that one of his opponents made some bold conclusions based on the statistical materials of only eight years out of ten, which was a completely wrong method; while Lenin himself cited nearly thirty years of statistical figures to analyze the characteristics of European Russian grain production in the second half of the nineteenth century.

Such a book is obviously the result of a huge research effort. There are no "conceptual games" here, nor any traces of rough edges, patching together, or piling up unrelated materials, but rather using the richest facts and Marxist analysis to reach irrefutable scientific conclusions.

Not only is "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" like this, but it can be said that all works with scientific theoretical value are the result of detailed possession of materials and systematic and thorough analysis. "Capital" is the most brilliant example. This is because only the analysis and synthesis of a large number of facts can fully reveal the laws of the development of things; one-sided facts and individual examples, or piecing together some trivial facts, cannot constitute a theory. Just as a fascinating novel must have descriptions of characters with unique personalities (i.e., Hegel's so-called "this one"), an article on economic issues, if it does not have the necessary statistical materials or conclusions drawn from the analysis of a large number of materials, is really difficult to say has much scientific value.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in the "Government Work Report" when mentioning the active development of social sciences: "We should encourage social science theorists to conduct systematic and long-term efforts under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, fully grasp the relevant data, and engage in independent and creative research." This tells us that if we want to climb the peak of social science, or attempt to sow a new seed in the field of social science, we should engage in independent and creative research. The view that academic achievements can be "quickly made," as well as the dogmatic style of studying concepts from concepts and neglecting systematic investigation and research, are hindering the further improvement of the current academic level. Therefore, learning Lenin's diligent attitude in writing "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" is of paramount importance to social scientists.

### 一个范例——读列宁“俄国资本主义底发展”想到的

    一个范例
    ——读列宁“俄国资本主义底发展”想到的
    迟蓼洲
    “俄国资本主义底发展”是列宁在六十年前写的一部杰出的马克思主义经济理论著作。
    列宁写这一本书，一直继续了三年多。他在流放期间，在极端困难的条件下，用尽了各种办法搜集一切他所需要的材料，而写完每一章，又都经过当时在一起流放的社会民主党人阅读过和讨论过，就是在这本书出版之后，他还不断地根据更新的材料，在新版上作了许多补充。看过这本书的人，首先感到的是列宁引证了非常丰富的统计材料。为了研究农民之分化为农村资产阶级与无产阶级的过程，列宁特别利用俄国地方自治局的统计材料，但是当时那些地方自治局的统计学家们，常常带有偏见地整理统计材料，把它们错误地加以分类，大大地减低了它们的价值。这样，就不得不使列宁十分细心地去考查和整理这些统计材料，并且自己重新进行计算，制成图表，给这些数字以科学的分类和马克思主义的分析，从而为俄国经济发展描绘了一幅真实而鲜明的图画。
    列宁在回答民粹派对他的某些统计材料的非难时说：
    “要怎样才能不用统计材料也可以解决问题，——这个秘密，严峻的批判家没有揭示出来，因而我继续坚持着下列意见：宁肯负叙述枯燥的罪名，而不愿使读者认为我的观点是根据从‘资本论’所作的
  ‘引证’，而不是根据对俄国统计材料的研究。”
    当然，并不是说，任何一堆数目字都有它的重要意义。不仅有些统计数字需要细心地加以审查和甄别，特别是，为着能真正地说明问题，得出合乎客观规律的结论，也非有长时期的统计材料不行。对于这一点，列宁是反复加以强调的。例如他指出过：资本主义工业底发展只能循环式地进行着，因此，要比较各个时期，就必须采取好多年的统计材料，然后才能把特殊繁荣、高涨底年代和衰落底年代划分清楚。又如列宁为了研究欧俄的谷物生产，但是由于当时收获的巨大波动，使得个别时期或个别年代的统计材料完全无用。为此，他特别指出他的一个论敌只从十年中的八年统计材料作出了一些最大胆的结论，就是一种完全错误的方法；而列宁自己则引用将近三十年的统计数字来分析十九世纪后半世纪的欧俄谷物生产的特点。
    这样一本书，显然是一种巨大研究工作的成果。这里没有“概念游戏”，也没有任何粗枝大叶，东拼西凑，把毫不相干的材料堆砌在一起的痕迹，而是用最丰富的事实和马克思主义分析来达到不可辩驳的科学结论。
    不仅“俄国资本主义底发展”是如此，可以说，一切有科学理论价值的著作，无一不是详细占有材料，进行有系统的周密的分析的结果。“资本论”就是一个最光辉的例子。这是因为，只有对大量事实的分析和综合，才能充分揭示出事物发展的规律；只凭片面的事实和个别的例子，或者东鳞西爪的凑些琐碎事实，是不能构成理论的。正如一篇引人入胜的小说，必须要有描写具有独特性格的人物（即黑格尔的所谓“这一个”）一样，一篇经济问题的文章，如果没有必要的统计材料或根据大量的材料加以分析而得出的结论，实在很难说具有多大的科学价值。
    周恩来总理在“政府工作报告”中提到积极发展社会科学的时候说：“应当鼓励社会科学理论工作者在马克思列宁主义指导下，进行有系统的、长时间的努力，充分掌握有关的资料，从事独立的、创造性的研究。”这就告诉我们，如果要攀登社会科学高峰，或者企图在社会科学领域里播种一粒什么新的种子，就应当从事独立的、创造性的研究。那种认为在学术上可以“速成”的观点，以及从概念出发来研究概念、而轻视进行系统的调查研究的教条主义作风，正是阻碍目前学术水平进一步的提高。因此，学习列宁写作“俄国资本主义底发展”那种辛勤的态度，对社会科学工作者来说，就具有头等重要的意义。
