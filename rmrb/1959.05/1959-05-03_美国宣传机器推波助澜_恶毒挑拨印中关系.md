Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from New York: The latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report" weekly, scheduled to be published on the 4th, carries a report in its "World Briefs" column written from Hong Kong by the magazine's Far East Bureau Chief, viciously provoking relations between India and China.

The article says that the "long-standing 'unbreakable friendship'" between China and India "has cracked at the seams," and that "it is currently difficult to avoid a breakdown in relations between India and Communist China."

The article attacks the Chinese people's counterattack against the interference of Indian expansionists as "exerting every effort to intimidate Nehru," and further uses a provocative tone, saying, "Indians and most Asian public opinion support the Dalai Lama against China."

This mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalists also published another article in the same issue, viciously provoking relations between Nepal and China, falsely portraying Nepal as a "victim of Chinese aggression," and fabricating rumors that Chinese troops, in pursuit of Tibetan rebels, "violated its (Nepal's) borders, attacked its villages, and tortured its people."

    美国宣传机器推波助澜
    恶毒挑拨印中关系
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：预定4日出版的最新一期“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊在“世界简讯”栏里发表了一篇由该刊远东版编辑主任从香港写回来的报道，其中恶毒地挑拨印度同中国的关系。
    文章说，中印两国之间“长期以来的‘牢不可破的友谊’在裂痕上裂开来了”，“目前要避免印度和共产党中国之间关系的破裂是很困难的”。
    这篇文章攻击中国人民反击印度扩张主义分子的干涉是什么“竭尽全力威吓尼赫鲁”，并且进一步用挑拨的口吻说，“印度人和大部分亚洲舆论都支持达赖喇嘛反对中国”。
    这家美国垄断资本家喉舌在同一期上还刊登了另一篇文章，恶毒挑拨尼泊尔同中国的关系，无中生有地把尼泊尔说成是“中国侵略的牺牲品”，并且造谣说什么中国军队在追击西藏叛匪时“侵犯它（尼泊尔）的边境，袭击它的村庄和拷打它的人民”。
