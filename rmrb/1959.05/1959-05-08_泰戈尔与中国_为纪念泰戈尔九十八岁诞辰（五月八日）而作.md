　　Tagore and China
　　——In Commemoration of Tagore's Ninety-Eighth Birthday (May 8th)
　　India Haiman Ge Biswas

　　Almost two years ago, when I arrived in China, India was commemorating Tagore's birthday nationwide. At that time, I was recuperating in a sanatorium. What made me feel exceptionally delighted due to a coincidental convergence was that a reproduction of a portrait of Tagore painted by the famous Chinese painter Xu Beihong hung on the wall of my room. In the corridor in front of my room, on that very day, the gardeners had placed a blooming red oleander. Red oleander, which Tagore used as the title of one of his plays, symbolizes resistance to the capitalist social order.

　　After coming to China, I often thought that the long and profound friendship between China and India, which had been interrupted by the interference and destruction of imperialists in both countries, was first re-established by Tagore. Whenever I think of the strength he put forth and the contributions he made for the friendship between China and India, I cannot help but feel full of pride and joy in my heart.

　　As early as 1881, when Tagore was only a twenty-year-old youth, he published an article titled "Death Trade in China" in a Bengali journal "Indian People," criticizing the dirty opium trade conducted by British imperialism against China. To the best of my knowledge, this was the first article written in an Indian language protesting the opium trade and the Opium War waged by British imperialists against China. In this article, Tagore used a sharp and sarcastic tone to lash out at the British imperialists. He said: "China cried and said, 'Ah, no. I've decided not to eat opium!' The British merchants replied: 'That won't do!' So they tied up China's hands, rammed opium down China's throat with cannons, and then said: 'Good, now you've eaten my opium! Pay up!'" In this article, Tagore listed the detailed numerical growth of the opium trade conducted by British imperialists against China and vividly and truthfully described the course of the Opium War. Finally, he explicitly pointed out the harm that the production of opium, a poisonous substance, by British imperialists in India brought to India.

　　In 1916, Tagore, in his "On the Way to Visiting Japan," described the Chinese porters he saw on the docks of Singapore. He used unparalleled and untranslatable descriptive phrases to praise them:

　　What first caught my attention was the labor of the Chinese workers on the docks. They wore only a pair of blue pants, their upper bodies naked. I have never seen such bodies, nor have I seen such labor. They are truly very strong bodies, without the slightest flaw. … From this confluence of the strength, skill, and joy of labor, I realized that the vast power of the entire Chinese nation is hidden within this broad class. … What the United States fears is precisely this vast power of China. They know they cannot defeat China's power that arises from labor, so they want to use force to suppress it.

　　Once this vast power of China is able to operate on the road to modernization, that is to say, master modern science, then there is probably no force in the world that can stop it from moving forward. … However, the more China, possessing this precious national strength, wants to develop, the more some countries that are exclusively planning for their own interests will try to destroy it.

　　These words were spoken as far back as 1916. How prescient they sound to us today!

　　Tagore visited China in 1924. His visit marked the beginning of a new era of friendship between India and China. He once addressed Chinese students in Beijing, saying: "I have come to you as an Asian. For a long time, silent Asia has been striving to regain its voice. The friendship and unity of China and India are the cornerstones of struggling Asia."

　　After returning to India from China, he gave a report to the masses at the University Association in Calcutta. He said: "In the past, Indian monks went to China to propagate Buddhism. My mission to China has nothing in common with that. I did not go to China to propagate anything. I went to China to discover the spirit of the oldest civilization that has been kept burning for centuries under the onslaught of countless storms. I went to China as a pilgrim to visit the temple that flickers with that burning spirit. I went to China with the purpose of understanding and learning, to bring the situation and beliefs of China back to India and give them to you." Tagore's proposal to strengthen the friendship between China and India as the cornerstone of a new Asia came from the correct internationalist point of view and was by no means the view of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" promoted by Japanese militarists. In his speeches at gatherings of Japanese expatriates in Shanghai, China, and in his speeches after returning to India, he strongly condemned the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" blueprint formulated by Japanese militarists under the guidance of chauvinistic ideas for their imperialist expansion plans. He said: "The idea of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' is simply a nightmare for me!" Here, we need to recall that in 1916, Tagore bravely criticized Japan's chauvinism and complete Westernization in a public square in Japan.

　　After returning to India from China, Tagore had been planning to establish a permanent and fixed institution to connect cultural exchanges between China and India. Thanks to his unremitting efforts, in 1937, a Chinese College was established at his International University in Shantiniketan. Tagore personally presided over the unveiling ceremony. In his opening speech, he said: "For me, today is truly a great day, a day that I have long been waiting for. From today onwards, I will be able to represent our people in reconnecting the cultural exchange and deep friendship between our people and the people of China. This is an ancient bond that was realized in our distant past, and it is a foundation laid by our ancestors more than 1,800 years ago with infinite perseverance and sacrifice." The Chinese College was the first academic institution established in modern India to study and research Chinese language and culture.

　　In the autumn of 1937, Japanese imperialists launched a war of aggression against China under the pretext of the Lugouqiao Incident. The entire Indian people raised their voices in indignation and freely donated and formed a medical aid team to China. At this time, Tagore once again stood on the front line to mobilize public opinion against Japanese imperialism. I still clearly remember the letters Tagore wrote to the Japanese poet Yonejiro Noguchi, which aroused unparalleled strong support for China and unparalleled strong indignation against Japan among our people. These letters were published in all patriotic newspapers in India.

　　Tagore confidently declared, "China is invincible!" and said: "We hope that in the near future, the Japanese and Chinese people will sweep away the painful memories of the past and join hands again. In this way, the humanitarian spirit of the true Asian people can be reborn."

　　Tagore remained bravely and firmly on the side of opposing imperialism, especially fascism, until his death. He contributed great strength to the national liberation movement.

　　The Tagore we understand as a true man, a thinker, and a literary writer, if he were still alive today, it can be said with certainty that he would be the strongest supporter of the People's Republic of China, because he would be able to see the "humanitarian spirit of the true Asian people" that he had dreamed of day and night being born under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. At the same time, he would surely severely rebuke that small group of people who, with selfish purposes and for personal gain, undermine the sacred Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the unbreakable friendship between China and India.

　　泰戈尔与中国
　　——为纪念泰戈尔九十八岁诞辰（五月八日）而作
    印度  海曼歌·比斯瓦斯
    差不多在两年以前我到达中国的日子里，印度正在全国范围内纪念泰戈尔的诞辰。那时候我在一个疗养院里休养。由于一种偶然的契合而使我感觉异常欣愉的是：在我的房间的墙上挂着一张中国著名画家徐悲鸿画的泰戈尔像的复制品。在我的房间前面的走廊上，正是那一天，花木工人摆了一棵盛开着的红夹竹桃。红夹竹桃，泰戈尔把它用来做为他的一个剧本的名字，象征着对于资本主义社会秩序的抗击。
    来到中国以后，我时常在想着，由于帝国主义者在中国和印度两国的干涉破坏而中断了的悠久而深厚的中印友谊，是被泰戈尔最先重新联系起来的。我一想到他为中国和印度的友好所拿出来的力量和做出来的贡献，便不由得在心中充满了骄傲和快乐。
    远在1881年的那年，泰戈尔还不过是个二十岁的年青人，他就在一个孟加拉语的期刊“印度人民”上发表了一篇以“在中国的死亡贸易”为题的文章，抨击英帝国主义对于中国进行的肮脏的鸦片贸易。以我的知识所及，这是用印度语言写出的第一篇抗议英帝国主义者对于中国进行鸦片贸易和进行鸦片战争的文章。在这篇文章里，泰戈尔用一种尖刻讽刺的手法去鞭挞英帝国主义者。他说：“中国一边哭泣着一边说，‘啊，不。我决定不吃鸦片！’英国商人回答了：‘那可不行！’于是把中国的双手捆了起来，用大炮将鸦片捣进中国的喉咙里，然后又说：‘好哇，现在你吃了我的鸦片啦！拿钱来吧！’”泰戈尔在这篇文章里列举了英帝国主义者对中国进行鸦片贸易的详细的数字上的增长，形象而如实地描述了鸦片战争的经过。最后他明确地指出英帝国主义者在印度生产鸦片这种毒物给印度所带来的危害。
    1916年，泰戈尔在他的“在访问日本的途中”描写了他在新加坡的码头上所看到的中国搬运工人。他运用了无可比拟的和无法翻译的形容语句来赞美他们：
    首先引起我注意的是码头上中国工人们的劳动。他们只穿着一条蓝色的裤子，上身赤裸着。我从来没有看见过这样的身体，也没有看见过这样的劳动。真是十分健壮的身体，挑不出一点儿瑕疵来。……从这种劳动的力量、技巧与欢乐的汇合里，使我体会到在这个广大的阶层里蕴藏着整个中国的巨大的力量。……美国所惧怕的正是中国的这种巨大的力量。他们知道他们不能战胜中国这种从劳动中所产生的力量，于是就想使用武力压迫。
    中国这种巨大的力量一旦能够在现代化的道路上运行，那就是说掌握现代科学，那时候，在世界上恐怕没有任何力量可以拦阻他向前迈进。……但是，具有这种可贵的民族力量的中国越是要想向前发展，有些专为自己的利益作打算的国家越是想尽主意来要摧毁他。
    这些话都是远在1916年的时候讲的，今天我们听起来，是多么富有预见性的语言哪！
    泰戈尔在1924年访问了中国。他的访问标志着印度和中国友谊的新的时代的开始。他在北京有一次向中国学生们讲话，说：“我是以一个亚洲人的身份到你们这里来的。长久以来，沉默的亚洲在为重新发出他的声音来而奋斗。中国和印度的友好和团结是奋斗的亚洲的奠基石。”
    他从中国回到印度之后，曾在加尔各答市的大学协会上向群众做过一个报告。他说：“在过去的年代里，印度的僧侣到中国去宣扬佛法。我到中国去的任务却与之全无共同之处。我到中国去没有宣扬任何东西。我到中国去是要发现那多少世纪以来在数不清的风暴的袭击之下，而仍旧保持燃烧着的最悠久的文明的精神。我到中国去是像一个参拜那闪烁着那种燃烧着的精神的寺院的朝圣者。我到中国去是怀着理解并且学习的目的，要把中国的情况和信念带回印度来，交给你们。”泰戈尔所提出的加强中国和印度的友谊，是新生亚洲的奠基石的话是从正确的国际主义的观点来看问题的，它绝不是日本军国主义者所宣传的“大东亚共荣圈”的看法。他在中国的上海的日本侨民的集会上和回国以后历次所发表的言论中都极为强烈地谴责了日本军国主义者在沙文主义思想的指导之下，为了其帝国主义扩张计划所拟制的“大东亚共荣圈”蓝图的口号。他说：“‘大东亚共荣圈’的提法对于我简直是一个梦魇！”在这里我们有必要回溯一下，在1916年泰戈尔在日本的一个公共广场上曾经勇敢地抨击日本的沙文主义和全盘西化的方式。
    泰戈尔从中国回到印度之后一直在筹划建立起一个沟通中国和印度文化交流关系的永久而固定的机构。由于他的不懈的努力，终于在1937年，他的在寂乡的国际大学里，一座中国学院成立了。泰戈尔亲自主持了揭幕的仪式。他在揭幕讲话里说：“对我来讲，今天真正是一个伟大的日子，是一个我长久所盼望着到来的日子。从今天起，我将能够代表我们的人民把我们的人民和中国的人民之间的文化交流和深厚友谊的关系重新联系起来，这是在我们过去的久远的年代里实现过的一种古老的契合，这是在一千八百多年前的我们的祖先们以无限的坚忍和牺牲所打下的基础。”中国学院是在现代印度所建立起来的第一个学习并研究中国语言和文化的学术机关。
    1937年的秋天，日本帝国主义者借口芦沟桥事件向中国发动了侵略战争。全体印度人民高扬起愤慨的声音，并且踊跃而自由地捐输，组成一个医药援华团到中国来。这时候，泰戈尔再一次站立在最前线上动员群众舆论反对日本帝国主义。我还清清楚楚地记得泰戈尔写给日本诗人野口米次郎的几封信说，在我们人民之间激起了对于中国的无比强烈的支援，对于日本的无比强烈的愤慨。这些信件发表在印度所有的爱国的报纸上。
    泰戈尔满怀信心地宣称“中国是不可征服的！”并说：“我们希望在不久的将来，日本人民和中国人民会把关于过去时代的苦痛的记忆一扫而光，重新相互携起手来。这样，真正的亚洲人民的人道主义精神才能得到重生。”
    泰戈尔一直到死，始终是勇敢而坚定地站立在反对帝国主义，特别是法西斯主义的立场上。对于民族解放运动，他贡献了巨大的力量。
    我们所理解的做为一个真正的人、一个思想家和文艺作家的泰戈尔如果今天还活在世上的话，可以肯定地说，他必然是中华人民共和国的最坚强的支持者，因为他能够看到在毛泽东同志的领导下诞生了他所日夜憧憬过的“真正的亚洲人民的人道主义精神”。同时，他也必定会向那一小撮怀着自私的目的，为着个人的利益而破坏神圣的和平共处五项原则和牢不可破的中国和印度的友好关系的家伙们进行最严厉的斥责。
