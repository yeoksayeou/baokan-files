Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th: The Hubei Provincial People's Committee recently held the province's first Materials Exchange Fair, with a transaction volume of over 160 million yuan for third-category commodities, further invigorating the province's urban and rural economy and materials exchange.

    In accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard," the fair ensured that the needs of the state and exports were met first when exchanging third-category commodities that were not directly included in the state plan. For example, the Yichang Prefecture and Yichang City delegations first completed the upward transfer tasks proposed by the province before conducting exchanges between cities, counties, and the prefecture. The representatives from Xiaogan Prefecture originally could not meet the demand for upward transfer of yellow vine strips. After discussion and detailed calculations, Puqi and other four counties increased the supply by 46,000 dan, completing the upward transfer task.

    The representatives participating in the exchange fair demonstrated selfless support for major cities and industrial and mining areas, as well as friendly cooperation among themselves. Thanks to the support from various regions, Wuhan City purchased approximately 40 million yuan worth of materials at this conference, ranking first in the province. Among them, the purchase of non-staple foods and other food items accounted for more than 68% of the total transaction volume of such commodities at the conference. Wuhan City also allocated a large number of daily-use industrial products and agricultural production materials to supply the countryside.

    This conference organized raw materials and materials worth 11 million yuan for industry, many of which were raw materials for major light industrial products. The Beikou Factory in Jiang'an District of Wuhan City completed a transaction with Huanggang, Sui County, Dawu and other counties for approximately 30,000 dan of seashells. From now until the first quarter of next year, the factory will have no problem with the raw materials needed for production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 27th: As the rural sowing season advances, commercial departments in Guangxi are preparing production materials needed for the summer harvest and planting in advance.

    Commercial departments generally adopted three methods to organize the production of summer harvest and planting materials. One is to obtain materials locally, process them locally, and supply them locally, so that communes and production teams can achieve self-production and self-use as much as possible. For example, the commercial department of Yishan County helped 168 production teams in the county establish 278 bamboo and wood farm tool factories. By the end of April, they had produced more than 290,000 pieces of plows, harrows, mud baskets, rain gear, etc. The Changzao Brigade of the Shuangqiao People's Commune in Wuming County, with the assistance of the commercial department, wove its own rain hats and sold more than 300 to support other production teams, in addition to meeting the needs of its own team. Another method is to hold materials exchange fairs to widely organize sources of goods and exchange what one has for what one needs. For example, the Longshan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Gui County held a materials exchange fair on May 7th, which acquired a large number of mud baskets, rain gear, buckets, brooms, hoe handles, and other items needed for summer agricultural production. In addition, in order to save raw materials and tap the potential of materials, commercial departments also organized part of the labor force through production departments to repair old and used farm tools in the countryside.

    In addition to organizing production units to process with raw materials allocated by the state, commercial departments also actively purchase raw materials and materials to supply to various production units. (Attached picture)

### 湖北召开物资交流会活跃城乡经济  广西商业部门提前准备夏收夏种生产资料

    湖北召开物资交流会活跃城乡经济
    广西商业部门提前准备夏收夏种生产资料
    新华社武汉27日电　湖北省人民委员会最近召开了全省第一次物资交流大会，成交第三类商品的金额达一亿六千多万元，进一步活跃了全省的城乡经济和物资交流。
    大会根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，交流没有直接纳入国家计划的第三类商品时，首先保证满足国家和出口的需要。如宜昌专区和宜昌市代表团，就是先按省提出的品种和数量完成上调任务以后，才在市、县和专区之间进行交流。孝感专区的代表原来提供上调的黄荆条不能满足需要，后来经过讨论和算细账，蒲圻等四县又增加了四万六千担，完成了上调任务。
    参加交流会的代表，都表现出对大城市和工矿区的无私支援，以及相互间的友好协作。由于各地的支援，武汉市在这次大会上购进物资约四千万元。这个数目居全省第一：其中购进的副食品和其他食品，占大会上这类商品交易总额的68％以上。武汉市也调剂出大量日用工业品和农业生产资料供应农村。
    这次大会为工业组织了价值一千一百万元的原料、材料，其中有很多是主要轻工业品的原料。武汉市江岸区贝扣厂与黄冈、随县、大悟等县成交了贝壳约三万担，从此，这个厂由现在到明年一季度生产所需要的原料都不成问题了。
    新华社南宁27日电　广西各地商业部门随着农村播种季节的提早，提前准备了夏收夏种需要的生产资料。
    商业部门一般采取了三种方法，组织夏收夏种生产资料的生产。一种是就地取材、就地加工、就地供应，使各公社和生产队尽量作到自产自用。如宜山县商业部门帮助全县一百六十八个生产队建立竹、木农具厂二百七十八个，到4月底止，已生产出犁、耙、泥箕、雨具等二十九万多件。武鸣县双桥人民公社长造大队在商业部门协助下，自己编织的雨帽除了满足本队需要以外，还出售三百多顶支援其他生产队。另一种是召开物资交流会，广泛组织货源，互通有无。如贵县龙山供销部在5月7日召开物资交流会，就收购了大批泥箕、雨具、水桶、扫帚、锄头柄等夏季农业生产需要的东西。此外，商业部门为了节约原材料和挖掘物资潜力，还通过生产部门组织一部分力量，到农村修补废旧农具。
    商业部门除了以国家拨给的原料，组织生产单位加工以外，还积极收购原料和材料，供应各生产单位。（附图片）
