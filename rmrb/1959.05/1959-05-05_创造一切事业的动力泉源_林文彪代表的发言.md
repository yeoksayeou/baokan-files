Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and support the government work report made by Premier Zhou, and the various reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

After listening to the reports, I feel extremely excited about the tremendous and brilliant achievements of the great leap forward in our national economy in 1958 and the unprecedented and great victories in various undertakings. I am filled with joy and confidence in the magnificent picture of our continued great leap forward this year and I am extremely happy. Now I will describe the progress of our country based on my personal observations:

The Miao People on Hainan Island Live a Peaceful and Happy Life

(1) Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country, the people have displayed soaring enthusiasm and are leaping forward again and again. Our socialist construction is advancing rapidly. The lives of all ethnic groups are thriving and improving step by step. The Miao people on Hainan Island, a minority ethnic group who were oppressed, impoverished, backward, had no food or clothing, and were forced into the mountains in old China, have been forever freed from poverty and oppression under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policies since liberation. They have established autonomous prefectures, organized people's communes, and popularized education. Now, most people have moved to the plains, living a peaceful and happy life, and their living standards are improving daily. They get along very well with the Han people and other ethnic groups.

Overseas Chinese Build Farms, and the Landscape Takes on a New Look

(2) In the old society, overseas Chinese, forced to live abroad for a living, were discriminated against and humiliated everywhere. They eagerly hoped that the motherland would become strong and improve the status of the Chinese nation. However, old China brought them disappointment and oppression. After liberation, our Party has shown great concern and support for overseas Chinese, helping them overcome various difficulties. With the country's prosperity and growth, the status of overseas Chinese abroad has also been unprecedentedly improved. In 1953, the government provided loans to help a group of distressed returned overseas Chinese build farms and settle their lives. At that time, it was a notorious malaria area, a "bone pit," full of barren mountains and fields, with very few people. I visited it twice, and in just four years, the landscape has been completely transformed. Now it is a large-scale people's commune, full of crops and plants all over the mountains, producing a large number of spices, pepper, coffee, cocoa and other tropical crops, and it also has its own very good agricultural product processing plant. Previously, it relied on government loans, but now, in addition to self-sufficiency, it can also hand over a large amount of products to the government. In order to help them further develop tropical crops, the government still provides material and technical assistance constantly. The living standards of the people here have been greatly improved, and everyone can now enjoy at least a cup of very high-quality coffee every day. Before long, it will appear as a new city.

Guangdong Will Become One of the Southern Heavy Industry Bases of the Motherland

(3) Four years ago, Guangdong Province was still a province mainly based on agriculture, and industry was only some original light industries such as sugar making and paper making. Today, Guangdong Province has not only achieved an unprecedented great leap forward and bumper harvest in agriculture, but also has many large and small factories. The proportion of industry has increased a lot. Guangdong not only has a large number of light industries, but also has discovered abundant reserves of coal mines, oil fields, good iron ore and other mineral deposits, and the seeds of heavy industry have already appeared. It can be expected that in a few years, Guangdong will become one of the southern heavy industry bases of the motherland.

New Achievements in the Motherland's Chemical Industry

(4) In the chemical industry, which is my own professional field, there has been a leap forward development in recent years. The People's Daily once mentioned: The chemical industry has also made great leaps forward. The output of various major chemical products has increased significantly compared with 1957. The output of soda ash increased by 29 percent compared with 1957, caustic soda increased by 31 percent, sulfuric acid increased by 19 percent, synthetic ammonia increased by 59 percent, ammonium nitrate increased by 157 percent, chemical fertilizers increased by 34 percent, calcium carbide increased by 44.6 percent, tires increased by 97 percent, and antibiotics increased by 334 percent. Such a rate of development has not been seen in any previous year. It is unimaginable in capitalist countries at any time.

Where There is Obedience to the Party, There is Victory

Why is it that the same motherland, the same compatriots, were poor and backward in the old society, with people struggling to survive, on the verge of death, while in the new society they are developing rapidly, full of vitality, and striving to make progress? The reason is the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist organization. With the leadership of the Communist Party, there is a new China, and the people have such great strength and wisdom to build a new China and achieve such great achievements in a short period of time. No wonder our people, and I am one of them, sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao anytime and anywhere. Taking the socialist road and listening to the Communist Party is absolutely true and is the guarantee for building socialism. Facts have proved that where there is disobedience to the Party, there is failure; where there is obedience to the Party, there is victory.

Production Will Always Develop Forward

Life Will Always Flourish

In just ten short years, the development of our country in all aspects has been unprecedented, and even our enemies have to admit this. From the perspective of the interrelationship between production relations and productive forces, when production relations lag behind productive forces, they hinder the development of productive forces, and when they are suitable, they play a driving role. We have seen that since the land reform, farmers have consciously and voluntarily organized mutual aid groups, and then production cooperatives, step by step developing into comprehensive production people's communes. Each time the production relations are improved, production takes a leap forward. The great leap forward in all aspects of production in 1958 is even clearer and more obvious, a truly vivid example. The people's commune is a social grassroots structure in our new society that combines industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and it is also a basic-level political power organization that combines government and commune. Its production relations can be adjusted freely, and its mutual assistance with various communes can always adapt to the requirements of productive forces. Therefore, the socialist production relations in our country are always suitable for its productive forces, and always promote the advance of productive forces. Our productive forces will always develop forward, which means our lives will always flourish.

The Combination of Party Leadership and Mass Movement

Is the Infinite Power to Overcome Difficulties

All our policies and guidelines are correct. It is inevitable that some detours or technical shortcomings will appear in the process of implementation or operational techniques, and the Party and the government have promptly reversed them. For example, in agriculture, the Party put forward instructions for consolidating the commune. During our inspection in Guangdong, we saw cadre meetings at all levels, four, five, and six levels, held in various places. The number of attendees ranged from seven or eight thousand to as many as fifteen thousand. They actively discussed production plans and the new commune system to ensure increased production, conservation, and continued leap forward this year. In industry, the Party has also put forward technological innovation and technological revolution. The shortcomings that we did not recognize before, or rarely saw, can now be discovered and analyzed and resolved in a timely manner. As a result, countless creations and technical improvements have emerged from the masses in recent years, constantly saving, greatly increasing the output and quality of products, and producing many new products at the same time.

With the combination of Party leadership and the masses, there is the source of motivation for creating all undertakings, and there is the guarantee for overcoming all difficulties. The combination of Party leadership and the mass movement is an invincible and inexhaustible force.

### 创造一切事业的动力泉源  林文彪代表的发言

    创造一切事业的动力泉源
    林文彪代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理，彭真副委员长的各项报告。
    听了报告以后，我对我国一九五八年国民经济大跃进所取得的巨大光辉成就和各项事业的空前伟大胜利，感到无比兴奋，对于我国今年继续大跃进的宏伟图景，充满愉快和信心，感到万分高兴。现在就我视察亲身看到我国进步的情况，分述如下：
    海南岛苗族过着安居乐业生活
    （1）在中国共产党的正确领导下，在全国各族人民的大团结下，人民群众发挥了冲天的干劲，跃进又跃进。我国的社会主义建设事业正在万马奔腾，一日千里地向前发展。各族人民的生活正在蒸蒸日上，步步提高。在旧中国受压迫，贫困落后，衣食无着，被逼进山里的海南岛少数民族——苗族，解放以后在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，永远摆脱了贫困和受压迫的状态。他们成立了自治州，组织了人民公社，普及了教育。现在大多数人都已搬到平原地区，过着安居乐业的生活，生活水平日益提高，他们和汉族和各族人民相处得十分融洽。
    华侨兴建农场，面貌焕然一新
    （2）在旧社会里，为生活所迫侨居国外的华侨，在国外到处受人歧视、凌辱。他们迫切盼望祖国早日强大起来，提高中国民族的地位。但是，旧中国带给他们的是失望和压迫。解放以后，我们的党对华侨是百倍的关心和支持，帮助他们克服各种困难。国家富强蒸蒸日上，华侨的地位在国外也得到了空前的提高。一九五三年政府贷款帮助一批受难归国华侨兴建农场，安置他们的生活。当时那里是有名的疟疾区、骨头坑，到处是荒山野地，极少人烟。我曾两次去视察，时间不过四年，面貌已焕然一新。现在那里已是规模宏大的人民公社了，到处都是作物满园、植物满山，出产有大量的香料、胡椒、咖啡和可可等热带作物，而且又有了自己很好的农产品加工厂。以前是依靠政府贷款，而现在除了自给自足以外，还能大量上缴，政府为了帮助他们进一步发展热带作物，还是经常不断地给予物质和技术援助。这里人民的生活水平有了很大的提高，每一个人现在每天最少能有一杯很高级的咖啡吃，用不了多久，这里就要以一个新的城市而出现了。
    广东将成为祖国南方重工业基地之一
    （3）四年以前，广东省还是以农为主的省，工业也不过是原有一些制糖、造纸等轻工业，而今天的广东省不仅在农业上取得了史无前例的大跃进，大丰收，同时更出现许许多多、大大小小的工厂，工业的比重增加了很多。广东不仅是有了大批的轻工业，也发现了储量丰富的煤矿、油矿，有了良好的铁矿和其他矿藏，而且已经出现了重工业的萌芽，可以意想到，用不了几年广东就将变成祖国南方的重工业基地之一。
    祖国化学工业的新成就
    （4）在我自己业务岗位的化学工业方面，几年来有了飞跃的发展，人民日报曾提到：化学工业也有了很大的跃进。各种主要化工产品产量比一九五七年都有很大的增长。纯碱的产量比一九五七年增长了百分之二十九，烧碱增长了百分之三十一，硫酸增长了百分之十九，合成氨增长了百分之五十九，硝铵增长了百分之一百五十七，化学肥料增长了百分之三十四，电石增长了百分之四十四点六，轮胎增长了百分之九十七，抗菌素增长了百分之三百三十四。这样的发展速度，是以往任何一年所没有的。在资本主义国家是任何时候也不能想像的。
    那里听党的话，那里就胜利
    为什么同样的祖国河山，同样的同胞群众，在旧社会是贫穷、落后，人们垂死挣扎，奄奄一息，而在新社会是发展跃进，生气勃勃，奋发有为，原因何在？就是有共产党的领导，社会主义的组织。有了共产党的领导才有新中国，人民群众才有这样伟大的力量与智慧来建设新中国，在短短时间内获得了这样伟大的成就。无怪乎我们老百姓，我也是其中一个，都由衷地随时随地感谢共产党和毛主席。走社会主义的道路、听共产党的话是千真万确的，是建设社会主义的保证。事实证明：那里不听党的话，那里就失败，那里听党的话，那里就胜利。
    生产永远向前发展
    生活永远欣欣向荣
    仅仅十年短暂时间，我国各方面的发展是史无前例的，连我们的敌人也不得不承认这一点。从生产关系与生产力互相联系来看，生产关系落后于生产力时，就阻碍生产力的发展，适合的话就起推动作用。我们看到自从土改后，农民自觉自愿地组织了互助组，进而为生产合作社，一步一步发展到综合生产的人民公社。每一次生产关系的改进，生产就跃进一步，一九五八年各方面的生产大跃进，更看得清楚明白，是一个千真万确的活生生的例子。人民公社是我国新社会一个工、农、商、学、兵相结合的社会基层结构，又是政社合一的基层政权组织。它的生产关系得以自如的调整，与各公社间彼此的协助，随时可相适应生产力发展的要求。所以我国社会主义的生产关系永远适合其生产力，永远推动生产力前进，我们的生产力永远向前发展，也就是我们的生活永远欣欣向荣。
    党的领导与群众运动结合
    是战胜困难无穷无尽的力量
    我国无论那一件方针政策，都是正确的，在执行措施或在操作技术的过程中，或多或少出现一些措施弯路，或一些技术缺点是不可避免的，党与政府都及时扭转了。例如，在农业方面，党提出整社的指示，我们在广东视察中看见各地开四级、五级和六级的各级干部会议。到会人数有七、八千人，多者一万五千人。他们踊跃讨论生产计划与公社新体制来保证增产节约及今年继续跃进。在工业方面，党又提出技术革新和技术革命，我们以前认识不到的缺点，或很少看到的缺点，现在也能及时发现问题及时分析解决。因而几年来群众出现了无数的创造与技术改进，不断地节约，大大提高产品的产量和质量，同时生产了许多新产品。
    有党的领导与群众相结合，就是创造一切事业的动力泉源，就是克服一切困难的保证。党的领导与群众运动相结合是战无不胜，攻无不克，无穷无尽的力量。
