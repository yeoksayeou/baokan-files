Poyang Lake Fishermen's Song (Two Songs)
	Peach blossoms red, people laugh, carp are plump,
	A gentle breeze turns the Poyang Lake shore green,
	Reporting the fishing season of the fishermen's families.
	The commune's conch shell sounds,
	Thousands of households rise like spring thunder.
	Waves push boats, boats chase waves,
	Fishing boats are proud, oars like flying.
	Four hundred miles of lake, eight hundred miles of shore,
	Peach blossoms red, people laugh, carp are plump.

	The sun sets in the west, boats don't return,
	The fishermen don't know weariness,
	The more fish, the sweeter the heart,
	Love the boundless beauty of the lake,
	The sun sets in the west, boats don't return.
	The sun sets in the west, boats don't return,
	The lake is full of clouds and mist;
	Parting the mist to cast hooks and nets,
	Scooping up a round of bright moon to illuminate the lake.

    鄱湖渔歌（两首）
    王一民桃红人笑鲤鱼肥轻风吹绿鄱湖岸，报道渔家春汛期。公社一声螺号响，千家万户起春雷。浪推船来船赶浪，渔船得意桨如飞。四百里湖水八百里岸，桃红人笑鲤鱼肥。
    西天日落不归船打鱼人儿不知倦，鱼越多来心越甜，喜爱湖光无限好，西天日落不归船。西天日落不归船，满湖云雾满湖烟；拨开烟雾投钩网，捞一轮明月照湖天。
