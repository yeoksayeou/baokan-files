　　Advance Under the Banner of Peace, Unity, and Progress
    World Peace Council Holds Meeting for the Tenth Anniversary of the Peace Movement
    Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling and Premier Zhou Enlai Send Special Telegrams of Warm Congratulations
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling sent a telegram to the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council, warmly congratulating the convening of the meeting. The telegram reads as follows: Special Meeting of the World Peace Council:
    On the occasion of the World Peace Council holding a special meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement, please allow me to extend my warm congratulations to the meeting and pay my highest respects to the World Peace Council and peace fighters from all countries who have been tirelessly fighting for the maintenance of peace.
    These ten years have been ten years of victory for the peace movement. The joint efforts of the people of the world have repeatedly curbed the dangerous situations created by the imperialist aggressive blocs and defended peace. The people of the world, united as one, will continue to work hard and will further defeat the imperialist war policies and aggressive conspiracies. I firmly believe that this special meeting will make new contributions to easing the current international tensions and further strengthening the struggle of the people of all countries for peace.
    I wish the meeting a complete success and wish the World Peace Movement greater prosperity in the future.
                    Soong Ching Ling

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council, warmly congratulating the convening of the meeting. The telegram reads as follows: Special Meeting of the World Peace Council:
    On the occasion of the World Peace Council holding a special meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend my warm congratulations to the meeting for the vigorous development of the World Peace Movement over the past ten years and for the brilliant victories achieved by the vast number of people around the world in the struggle to safeguard peace.
    At present, the development of the international situation is becoming increasingly favorable to the cause of striving for and maintaining peace, and the war-makers have fallen into unprecedented isolation. However, imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is still stubbornly clinging to its policies of arms expansion and war preparations, cold war, and suppression of national independence movements, and is attempting to use the insidious methods of splitting the unity of the people of the world to promote their new plans for aggression and expansion. The people of all countries who are striving for peace must continue to heighten their vigilance. We believe that as long as the socialist forces, the forces of national independence movements, and other peace-loving forces unite as one and persevere in their struggle, they will surely be able to smash the imperialist war policies and aggressive policies, and they will surely be able to guarantee world peace.
    The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and have made unyielding efforts to oppose foreign aggression and interference and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. In the future, the Chinese people will continue to work together with all oppressed, invaded, and peace-loving people of all countries to contribute their share to maintaining world peace, easing international tensions, and promoting friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.
    I wish the meeting success, I wish the World Peace Council victory in advancing under the banner of peace, unity, and progress, and I wish the just cause of the people of the world in striving for peace, democracy, and independence greater victories!
                                                Zhou Enlai
                                          May 7, 1959

    新华社7日讯　周恩来总理致电世界和平理事会特别会议，热烈祝贺会议的召开。电文如下：世界和平理事会特别会议：
    值此世界和平理事会为纪念世界和平运动十周年举行特别会议之际，我代表中国政府和人民，为十年来世界和平运动的蓬勃发展，为全世界广大人民在维护和平的斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利，向会议致以热烈的祝贺。
    目前，国际形势的发展越来越有利于争取和维护和平的事业，战争制造者已经陷于空前孤立。但是，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义还在顽固地坚持扩军备战政策、冷战政策和镇压民族独立运动的政策，并且妄图用分裂世界人民团结的阴险手法，推行他们新的侵略扩张计划。全世界争取和平的各国人民必须继续提高警惕。我们相信，只要社会主义力量、民族独立运动的力量和其他爱好和平的力量团结一致，奋斗不懈，就一定能够粉碎帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，就一定能够保障世界和平。
    中国政府和中国人民一贯信守和平共处的五项原则，为反对外来的侵略和干涉、维护远东和世界的和平进行了不屈不挠的努力。今后，中国人民将继续同一切被压迫、被侵略和爱好和平的各国人民一起，为维护世界和平、缓和国际紧张局势和促进各国人民的友好合作贡献出自己的一份力量。
    祝会议成功，祝世界和平理事会高举和平、团结、进步的旗帜胜利前进，祝全世界人民争取和平、民主、独立的正义事业获得更大的胜利！
                                                周恩来
                                          1959年5月7日
