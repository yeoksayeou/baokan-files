Okinawa Island

Okinawa Island is located in the Pacific Ocean east of China, between Japan and China's Taiwan Province. It is the main island of the Ryukyu Islands, with an area of approximately 1,200 square kilometers, including nearby small islands, and a population of approximately 800,000.

Since Japan established "Okinawa Prefecture" in the Okinawa Island area in 1879, Okinawa Island has been a Japanese territory. However, the United States occupied Okinawa Island in June 1945 and has refused to return it to Japan ever since.

In the past fourteen years, the United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building military bases on Okinawa Island, of which Kadena Air Base is the largest US base in the western Pacific. The US military authorities have also transported medium-range missiles with nuclear warheads to Okinawa Island, and built eight missile bases on the island.

The United States has turned Okinawa into a military base, threatening peace in the Far East and causing the people of Okinawa to suffer oppression and enslavement. Among the 72,000 farm households on the island, as many as 50,000 have lost their land due to the US military's seizure. The basic rights of the people of Okinawa have been brutally deprived. Under the leadership of the Okinawa People's Party, they have launched an anti-American struggle demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan. In December 1956, despite all kinds of threats and obstruction from the American occupiers, the people of Okinawa elected Kamejiro Senaga, the Secretary-General of the Okinawa People's Party, as the Mayor of Naha. However, the US military authorities forced Kamejiro Senaga to step down in November of the following year. Today, as the United States and Japan are stepping up preparations to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" to strengthen the so-called "US-Japan military alliance," the United States' control over Okinawa has become even more intensified. The United States has built Okinawa into a huge nuclear war base in the Far East. In order to further suppress the Okinawan people's opposition to American enslavement and their demands for the return of Okinawa to Japan, the US military government has promulgated an ordinance on criminal law and litigation procedures, launching a new provocation against the Okinawan people.

    冲绳岛
    冲绳岛在我国东面太平洋上，位于日本与我国台湾省之间，是琉球群岛的主岛，面积连同附近的小岛在内，约一千二百平方公里，人口约八十万。
    自1879年日本在冲绳岛地区设“冲绳县”以来，冲绳岛一直是日本的属地。但美国在1945年6月占领了冲绳岛，至今拒绝归还日本。
    十四年来，美国花了数以亿计的美元，在冲绳岛建立军事基地，其中嘉手纳飞机场是美国在太平洋西部的最大基地。美军当局并已把装有核弹头的中程导弹运到冲绳岛，在该岛建筑了八处导弹基地。
    美国把冲绳变为军事基地，威胁远东和平，并使冲绳居民受尽压迫和奴役。因美军强占而失去土地的居民，在全岛农户七万二千户中，竟达五万户之多。冲绳人民的基本权利横遭剥夺。他们在冲绳的人民党领导下，展开了要求把冲绳归还日本的反美斗争。1956年12月，冲绳人民不顾美国占领者的百般威胁和阻挠，选出了冲绳人民党书记长濑长龟次郎为那霸市长。但美军当局于次年11月迫使濑长龟次郎下台。在美日加紧筹划修改日美“安全条约”，以加强所谓“美日军事同盟”的今天，美国对冲绳的控制更是变本加厉。美国已经把冲绳建成它在远东的一个巨大的核战争基地。为了进一步镇压冲绳人民的反对美国奴役和要求把冲绳交回日本的活动，美国军政府颁布了一项关于刑法和诉讼手续法的法令，向冲绳人民开始了新的挑衅。
