The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique hypocritically calls the rebellious armed forces they have gathered the "Religious Army." These bandits, under the guise of "defending religion" and "protecting national interests," are engaged in heinous crimes such as murder, arson, rape, plunder, and the destruction of religion. The Tibetan people aptly call these bandits "beasts in clothing and jackals in monks' robes."

The so-called "Religious Army" desecrates Buddha statues, burns scriptures, slaughters lamas, and rapes nuns in temples, committing all kinds of evil. On March 19, after the rebels stormed into the Jokhang Temple, they defecated and urinated everywhere in the main scripture hall. Some smashed Buddha statues to pieces, others used guns to smash Buddha statues, and looted more than 30 gilded Buddha statues. At that time, two lamas, Raoqin Qiangba and Gesang Wangjie, came out to protect these Buddha statues. The rebels shot and killed Raoqin Qiangba on the spot and wounded Gesang Wangjie. Gaqiong·Ciren Dunzhu, deputy director of the Shannan Military Control Commission who believes in Buddhism, had his home looted by the rebels because he loved the motherland. The rebels looted his family's property, set fire to his house, killed his son, Caiwang Nab, and burned all 215 volumes of scriptures he had treasured. When the rebels robbed the property of herdsmen in Tonglong Pasture, they threw a Buddha statue from the yurt of herdsman Renqing Wangjie more than ten feet away, and then chased after it and trampled on it. In Namulin County, the rebels tore up all the Tibetan scriptures in the scripture hall, smashed the Dharma instruments used by the lamas for chanting, and even stole the clothes worn by the Buddha statues. Nuns in many temples, such as Gandan Yayu Temple, Ciren Qiong Temple, and Bodao Temple, were raped by these so-called "defenders of religion." A nun from Bodao Temple was gang-raped by six rebels when she passed near Renjiecha Temple, which was occupied by rebels, on her way home. A young nun, only fourteen years old, from Gandan Yayu Temple was also gang-raped by rebels.

The rebels are even more vicious towards the general public. Many areas were almost completely deserted after the rebels passed through. In Tonglong Pasture, the rebels surrounded the yurts of eleven herdsmen families, looted all valuable clothes and furniture, and set fire to anything that could not be carried away or was old and broken. An old man named Tamu Simen in Qiongduojiang area starved to death in the mountains after his zanba was robbed by the rebels. When the rebels besieged Zedang, they also frantically destroyed the river dam that the people of Zedang relied on to store drinking water, maliciously trying to cut off the local people's water source. In Naidong County, Zedang area, young girls from twelve or thirteen years old to old women in their fifties were all raped by the rebels. In the Dangxu area, the rebels also abducted most of the young women. The barbarity and cruelty of these rebels when they massacre the masses is appalling. The rebels who fled to the Pozhang area captured a nine-year-old boy named Sang'er Yini who was grazing sheep on the hillside. They cut open the child's stomach, took out his heart and ate it, then cut his body into pieces and hung them on trees. Losang Duodeng, a Tibetan official who had visited Beijing, was accused of being "pro-Han" and was cut to death piece by piece with knives by the rebels, and his remains were chopped into pieces and thrown into a ditch. A businessman named Dongda Bazha in Naidong County was arrested and beaten by the rebels because he refused to participate in the rebellion. Then, the rebels cut off one of Dongda Bazha's ears. After the rebels killed Dongda Bazha, they abducted his young wife to Anjue Temple and raped her. Dengzeng Xirao, a resident of Zedang, was robbed of all his family's property by the rebels and then arrested and beaten half to death with wooden sticks wrapped in iron thorns, simply because he sold some firewood to the People's Liberation Army. Finally, they shot him to death.

When the People's Liberation Army pursued and suppressed the rebels in the Zedang area, these inhumane bandits even captured more than 20 women and children, drove them to the front line of their positions as human shields, forcing the People's Liberation Army to not be able to fire. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with tears of righteous indignation in their eyes, went around behind and onto the roofs of these bandits to eliminate them. When Gaqiong·Ciren Dunzhu, deputy director of the Shannan Military Control Commission, spoke to reporters about this incident, he held his head in his hands and cried bitterly, saying: "May all parents in the world condemn these beasts in clothing and jackals in monks' robes!"

This is the heinous crime committed by the Tibetan rebels under the guise of "defending religion" and "protecting national interests"! And what the Indian reactionaries and interventionists "sympathize" with are precisely these beasts and jackals. (Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 4th)

    西藏叛匪的“卫教军”
    ——衣冠禽兽和披着袈裟的豺狼
    新华社记者　于逢源
    西藏上层反动集团把他们纠集的叛乱武装伪善地叫做“卫教军”。这一批匪徒打着“保卫宗教”、“保护民族利益”的幌子，干着杀人放火、奸淫掳掠、破坏宗教等罪恶勾当，西藏人民一针见血地把这些匪徒叫做“衣冠禽兽和披着袈裟的豺狼”。
    所谓“卫教军”在寺庙里捣毁佛像、焚烧经书、屠杀喇嘛、强奸尼姑，无恶不作。3月19日，叛匪们闹入大昭寺后，在大经殿里到处大小便，有的把佛像摔得粉碎，有的用枪捣击佛像，并抢走了三十多尊镀金佛像。当时，绕钦强巴、格桑旺杰两个喇嘛出来保护这些佛像，叛匪当场枪杀了绕钦强巴，打伤了格桑旺杰。信仰佛教的山南军管会副主任噶炯·次仁顿珠由于热爱祖国，全家遭到叛匪的洗劫，叛匪们抢走了他家里的财物，放火烧毁了他的房子，杀死了他的儿子才旺那布，并把他珍藏的二百一十五部经书全部烧毁。叛匪们在抢劫铜龙牛场牧民的财物时，把牧主仁清旺杰帐篷里的一尊佛像甩出一丈多远，然后又追上去，用脚践踏。在那木林宗，叛匪们撕毁了经堂里所有的藏文经书，打烂了喇嘛念经用的法器，连佛像穿的衣服也被抢走。甘丹雅玉寺、慈仁穷寺、博道寺等许多寺庙的尼姑，遭到这些所谓“保卫宗教”的叛匪们的奸污。博道寺的一个尼姑在回家的路上经过叛匪盘踞的仁结察寺附近时，遭到六个叛匪的轮奸。甘丹雅玉寺一个年仅十四岁的幼年尼姑也被叛匪轮奸了。
    叛匪们对一般群众更为毒辣。许多地区在叛匪们经过以后，几乎十室九空。在铜龙牛场，叛匪们把十一户牧民的帐篷全部包围起来，抢光了所有值钱的衣服和家具，并把不能驮走和破旧的东西放火烧掉。邛多江地区一个老人塔木司门的糌粑被叛匪抢走后，竟活活饿死在山里。叛匪们在围困泽当时，还疯狂地破坏了泽当人民靠它拦蓄饮水的拦河坝，狠毒地想断绝当地人民的水源。在乃东宗、泽当一带，有些村庄从十二、三岁的幼女到五十多岁的老太太，全被叛匪奸污。在当许一带，叛匪们还把大部分青年妇女劫走。这些叛匪屠杀群众时的野蛮和残酷是骇人听闻的。逃窜在颇章一带的叛匪捉住正在山坡上放羊的九岁男孩桑尔一尼后，剖开了这个孩子的肚子，把心挖出来吃掉了，然后又把他的尸体切成碎块，挂在树上。曾到北京参观过的藏族官员洛桑多登，以“亲汉”的罪名被叛匪用刀子一片一片地割死以后，残骨还被砍成碎块丢到水沟里。乃东宗一个名叫东达八扎的商人，因为不肯参加叛乱，叛匪们便把他和他的妻子抓起来，吊打过后，又把东达八扎的一个耳朵割掉，叛匪们杀死东达八扎后，又把他的年青的妻子抢到安觉寺强奸了。泽当居民登增锡饶，仅仅因为卖给了人民解放军一部分烧柴，叛匪们便抢光了他家里的全部财物，又把他捉去，用缠着铁刺的木棒把他打得半死，最后又开枪打死了他。
    当人民解放军追剿泽当地区的叛匪时，这些灭绝人性的匪徒竟抓来了二十多名妇女和儿童，把她们赶到自己的阵地前沿作为人墙，迫使人民解放军不能开枪，人民解放军的官兵含着义愤的眼泪，绕到这伙匪徒的背后和屋顶上，才把这些匪徒消灭了。山南军管会副主任噶炯·次仁顿珠在向记者谈起这件事时，他双手抱着头、痛哭流涕地说：“愿天下作父母的都来谴责这些衣冠禽兽和披着袈裟的豺狼吧！”
    这就是西藏叛乱分子在“保卫宗教”、“保护民族利益”的幌子下所犯下的滔天罪行！而印度反动派和干涉者们所“同情”的，正是这些禽兽和豺狼。　（新华社拉萨4日电）（附图片）
