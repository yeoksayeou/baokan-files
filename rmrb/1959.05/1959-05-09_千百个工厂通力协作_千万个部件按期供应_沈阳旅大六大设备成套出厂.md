　　Thousands of Factories Cooperate; Millions of Parts Supplied on Schedule
　　Shenyang-Lüda Completes and Ships Six Major Equipment Sets
　　(Our newspaper, Shenyang, 8th) Shenyang's machinery industry has implemented city-wide cooperation, strengthened production command and dispatch, and launched a red flag competition to increase production and practice economy, achieving a tremendous victory in manufacturing key equipment in April. As of April 30, two sets of heavy rolling mills, planned for the first half of the year, had been completed ahead of schedule, and partial components for four sets had been manufactured. With the exception of some power station and mining equipment, the coal washing, coking, and irrigation equipment that Shenyang was required to manufacture in the first half of the year has all been completed ahead of schedule.
　　This year, the nation eagerly hopes that Shenyang will exert even greater power in achieving the four major targets, requiring it to complete the sets and major supporting tasks for six key equipment areas in the first half of the year, including mining, coal washing and coking, irrigation, rolling steel, power generation, and locomotives and rolling stock, totaling fifty-three varieties and more than 80,000 units (pieces), with a net weight of more than 80,000 tons. This includes the nation's most urgently needed 1,291 coal washing equipment units, six sets of heavy rolling mills with an annual steel production of more than 2.3 million tons, three major categories of supporting equipment required for 559,000 kW power stations, such as large transformers, ultra-high voltage cables, and high-voltage switches, more than 8,000 types of various electrical and mechanical supporting equipment, and 100,280 horsepower of irrigation power equipment that can irrigate more than 350,000 mu of land. Among them, each of the six sets of heavy rolling mills weighs more than 1,000 tons, with 60,000 various components, and many large castings and forgings that Shenyang has never processed before. According to the world's advanced technical level, the production cycle for manufacturing a set of large rolling mills requires five to eight months, while Shenyang requires completion within two and a half months.
　　In order to complete the major tasks assigned by the state quickly and well, since the beginning of March, Shenyang has concentrated the superior strength of thousands of enterprises to launch a general offensive on six key equipment projects, quickly achieving results. In terms of heavy rolling mill manufacturing, in addition to producing a four-roller cold rolling mill with an annual output of 100,000 tons of silicon steel sheets, the greatest achievement was the completion of one set each of a 750mm rolling mill with an annual steel production of 600,000 tons and a 700mm rolling mill with an annual steel production of 800,000 tons. After more than two months of arduous struggle, the city completed the manufacturing task of 1,291 coal washing machines ahead of schedule by one month, which can supply more than 24 million tons of refined coal to the metallurgical industry annually. It also produced more than 13,400 sets of mining equipment. It completed the 100,280 horsepower irrigation equipment urgently needed for spring planting ten days ahead of schedule with 23.3% overfulfilment. During the same period, it completed the first batch of more than 2,500 units of main supporting equipment for power stations one month ahead of schedule. In addition, it also completed the manufacturing task of 342 locomotives and rolling stock.
　　Guided by the battle thought of "time will not come again, opportunity must not be missed," hundreds of thousands of mechanical workers in Shenyang seized the opportunity and won the victory. In early March, while assigning tasks, the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee pointed out the direction for completing the tasks, helped various factories overcome difficulties, and mobilized the city's workers and masses through various forms to launch a high-yield and high-quality red flag competition centered on technological revolution. This working method immediately achieved significant results. The Municipal Party Committee Secretary personally took charge of the warehouse, unified the allocation of materials, and led enterprises to clear the warehouse and tap potential materials. The workers and masses of various factories also widely adopted methods such as substitution, utilization, modification, and excavation to vigorously overcome the difficulty of insufficient materials. Subsequently, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, comprehensive cooperation was carried out, organizing the manpower and equipment of thousands of factories throughout the city to break through the technical barriers in manufacturing key equipment. At the same time, the city established a strong key equipment production headquarters headed by the Municipal Party Committee Secretary, with six production leading groups, organized a large number of production inspectors and special commissioners, arranged the production progress of each enterprise according to the number of units and pieces, and checked the production progress of each enterprise on a daily and piece basis, resolving problems immediately, thus ensuring that production plans and measures were implemented in the workshops and groups.
　　(Our newspaper, Lüda, 8th) After entering the second quarter, the progress of Lüda in manufacturing six major products has advanced by leaps and bounds, and equipment for rolling steel, power generation, coal preparation, and irrigation will be delivered one to two months ahead of the national plan.
　　The medium-sized thin plate rolling mill and seamless steel pipe rolling mill mainly manufactured by Dalian Steel Plant have recently completed assembly work and will soon be officially put into production; the main engine and supporting equipment of two roughing mills with a rolling diameter of 750 mm and 550 mm, each with an annual output of 500,000 tons of steel billets, have been basically manufactured, and the two main engines have been assembled. The manufacturing progress of the medium plate rolling mill with a rolling diameter of 2,300 mm and the roughing mill with a diameter of 650 mm has reached 25%-40%. The production volume of locomotives at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant has been increasing month by month, with a total of 70 units built in the past 120 days. In April, Dalian Shipyard and Lüda Machinery Plant have manufactured six 1,500 kW steam turbines, adding to a total of 13 units including those manufactured in the past; the manufacturing tasks for coal preparation and farmland irrigation equipment have been basically completed before "May Day". Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Plant undertook 25 sets of coking equipment this year, and has produced nine sets in the past four months, each set can equip two coking furnaces with an annual output of 400,000 tons of coke. Other key equipment such as 60-ton bottom turning vehicles, electric locomotives, steel ingot mold vehicles, steel ladles, and molten iron trucks, nearly 10,000 tons have been manufactured this year.
　　In order to complete the task of manufacturing six major products ahead of schedule, the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee established a general headquarters and meticulously carried out production organization work. Hundreds of factories throughout the city have formed a unified whole, forming a collaboration network according to a unified schedule, and separately manufacturing main engines and thousands of auxiliary machines and components. The city also concentrated superior manpower and material resources into this battle. Factories, schools, commercial units, and other units launched a vigorous "Five Contributions" campaign of contributing manpower, materials, equipment, electricity, and vehicles according to the needs of producing six major products. The steel materials contributed by various units alone reached more than 4,000 tons, enabling the factories manufacturing six major products to put a large amount of materials into production early before the state materials were transferred, breaking through the most difficult raw material "checkpoint" since the beginning of the year.
　　Manufacturing rolling mills and steam turbines is the first time in Lüda, and there are no corresponding technicians and equipment for the casting, forging, and processing of many large components and precision parts. In response to this difficulty, the Municipal Party Committee organized several factories to set up specialized manufacturing lines and focus on key components. The method of grasping is to frequently hold technical meetings on casting, forging, processing, etc., to mobilize the masses to speak freely and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. When casting a 23-ton large component, the rolling steel specialty manufacturing line of Dalian Shipyard did not have a large melting furnace of more than five tons. With the help of veteran workers and professors from brother units, the party committee secretary, factory director, and foundry workers adopted the method of melting iron in batches and casting simultaneously with several small iron ladles to overcome this difficulty. 65% of the rolling mills in this factory are processed with self-made simple equipment. The roots of the steam turbine blades are very precise. The city does not have a special milling machine. Special-grade labor models Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande jointly innovated a set of dies and tools, installed them on a lathe to replace the milling machine, and can mill more than 60 blade roots at a time with good quality, which accelerated the steam turbine manufacturing speed by more than doubled.
　　After conducting meticulous and rigorous production arrangements and breaking through the important "technical checkpoints", the workers in factories throughout the city launched the high-efficiency "thousand hours" campaign, greatly improving labor productivity and accelerating the manufacturing progress. More than 30% of the machine tools in the city have now reached or broken through the "thousand hours". (Attached photo)

　　千百个工厂通力协作　千万个部件按期供应
    沈阳旅大六大设备成套出厂
    本报沈阳8日电　沈阳市机械工业实行全市大协作，加强生产指挥和调度，开展增产节约红旗竞赛，在4月份取得了制造重点设备的巨大胜利。截至4月30日，上半年计划制造的六套重型轧钢机，两套已提前完成，四套已制成了部分部件；除部分的电站和矿山等设备外，国家要求沈阳上半年制造的洗煤、炼焦、排灌设备，已全部提前制成。
    今年国家热切期望沈阳市为实现四大指标发挥更大威力，要求它在上半年完成采矿、洗煤炼焦、排灌、轧钢、发电、机车车辆等六大重点设备的成套和重要配套任务，共有五十三个品种、八万多台（件），净重达八万多吨。包括国家最为急需的一千二百九十一台洗煤设备，年产钢材二百三十多万吨的六套重型轧钢机，五十五万九千瓩电站所需要的大型变压器、超高压电缆、高压开关等三大类配套设备，八千多种各类电器、机械配套设备和可以灌溉三十五万多亩土地的十万零二千八百多马力的排灌动力设备。其中六套重型轧钢机，每套重量在一千吨以上，各种部件有六万个，不少大铸件、大锻件，沈阳从未加工过。按世界先进技术水平，制造一套大型轧钢机的生产周期，需要五个月到八个月，而沈阳市则要求在两个半月内完成。
    为了又快又好地完成国家交予的重大任务，3月初以来，沈阳市集中上千个企业的优势力量，向六项重点设备发起总攻，很快收到了成果。在重型轧钢机制造方面，除制出一台年产十万吨矽钢片的四辊冷轧机外，最大成绩是：完成了年产六十万吨钢材的七百五十公厘轧钢机和年产八十万吨钢材的七百公厘轧钢机各一套。经过两个多月的艰苦奋战，全市承担的一千二百九十一台洗煤机制造任务，提前一个月完成，每年可为冶金工业供应二千四百多万吨精煤；并生产出一万三千四百多台矿山设备；提前十天超额23.3％完成了春播急需的十万零二千八百多马力排灌设备。同一时期，提前一个月完成了电站主要配套设备首批二千五百多台的任务，此外，还完成了三百四十二台机车车辆制造任务。
    沈阳市几十万机械工人在“时不再来，机不可失”的战斗思想指导下，抓住了时机，赢得了胜利。3月初，中共沈阳市委一面分配任务，一面指出完成任务的方向，帮助各厂克服困难，通过各种形式，动员起全市职工群众，开展以技术革命为中心的高产优质红旗竞赛。这一工作方法，立即收到显著成效。市委书记亲自坐镇仓库，统一调拨材料和领导各企业清查仓库，挖掘潜在材料；各厂职工群众也广泛采取了代、利、改、挖等办法，大力克服材料不足的困难。接着，在市委领导下，开展了全面大协作，把全市上千个工厂的人力、设备组织起来，突破制造重点设备的技术关。同时，全市成立了以市委书记为首的强有力的重点设备生产指挥部，下设六个生产领导小组，组织了大批生产检查员和特派员，按台按件排出各个企业的生产进度，按日按件检查各个企业生产进展情况，发现问题立刻解决，因而保证了生产计划和措施都能落实在车间和小组。
    本报旅大8日电　进入第二季度后，旅大市制造六大产品的进度突飞猛进，轧钢、发电、选煤和排灌等设备，都将比国家计划提前一、两个月交货。
    大连钢厂主制的中型薄板轧机和无缝钢管轧机，最近已经完成组装工作，不久可正式投入生产；两套年产五十万吨钢坯的轧辊直径七百五十公厘、五百五十公厘的初轧机的主机和配套设备已基本制成，两个主机已组装起来。轧辊直径二千三百公厘的中板轧机和六百五十公厘的初轧机等的制造进度已达到25％—40％。大连机车车辆厂机车的生产量月月上升，在过去一百二十天中，共造了七十台。4月份，大连造船厂、旅大机器厂已造出一千五百瓩汽轮机六台，加上过去造出的共达十三台；选煤和农田排灌设备的制造任务，“五一”以前已基本完成。大连工矿车辆厂今年承担了二十五套炼焦设备，在过去四个月中，已制出了九套，每套可装备年产四十万吨焦炭的炼焦炉两座。其他重点设备——六十吨翻底车、电机车、钢锭模车、盛钢桶、铁水车等，今年已制出了近万吨。
    为了提早完成制造六大产品的任务，中共旅大市委成立了总指挥部，细致地进行了生产组织工作。全市上百个工厂结成了统一的整体，按照统一的进度表，组成协作网，分别制造主机和成千上万个辅机、部件。全市并且集中优势的人力、物力投入这个战斗，工厂、学校、商业等单位，根据生产六大产品的需要，开展了轰轰烈烈的献人力、献材料、献设备、献电力、献汽车的“五献”运动。各单位仅献出的钢铁材料即达四千多吨，使制造六大产品的工厂，在国家材料未调来以前，提早大量投料，攻破了年初以来最困难的原材料“关口”。
    制造轧钢机、汽轮机，在旅大市是第一次，许多大型部件、精密零件的铸锻和加工，没有相应的技术工人和设备。市委针对这个困难，组织若干工厂设立专业制造线，大抓关键部件。抓的办法是：经常召开铸锻、加工等专业技术会议，发动群众大鸣大放，开展技术革新和技术革命运动。大连造船厂的轧钢专业制造线，在铸造二十三吨大部件的时候，没有五吨以上的大化铁炉，党委书记、厂长和铸造工人们，就在兄弟单位老工人、教授的帮助下，采取分次化铁，用几个小铁包同时浇铸的办法，突破了这个困难。这个厂的轧钢机，65％是用自制的简易设备加工的。汽轮机叶片的叶根很精密，全市没有专用铣床，特等劳动模范朱维勤、张连德共同革新了一套胎具和刀具，安在车床上代替铣床，一次可铣六十多个叶根，质量很好，使汽轮机制造速度加快了一倍多。
    在进行细致、严密的生产安排，并突破了重要的“技术关”以后，全市各工厂的职工们，开展了高工效“千台时”运动，大大提高了劳动生产率，加快了制造进度，全市30％以上的机床，现在已达到或突破了“千台时”。（附图片）
