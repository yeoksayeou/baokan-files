Hubei Selects a Batch of Cultural Relics to be Distributed to Revolutionary Museums and Historical Museums

Recently, the Hubei Provincial Museum, the Hubei Provincial Cultural Relics Management Office, and the Memorial Hall of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions during the Great Revolution, among other units, selected more than 500 revolutionary and historical cultural relics from more than 100,000 cultural relics collected and excavated over the years. These were distributed to the Chinese Revolution Museum and the Chinese History Museum to supplement and enrich the display content of these two museums.

These selected cultural relics mostly have high historical or artistic value. In terms of revolutionary cultural relics, there are: wooden gate passes and paper night slogan strips issued by the commander of Wuchang City during the Xinhai Revolution, cannon ropes used by the Red Army to cross the Junxian Yanchi River during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, kerosene lamps used by the Huanggang Farmers' Association for evening meetings, broken pottery bottoms and iron pots used by the rear hospitals of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army during the Anti-Japanese War, and silk jackets used by martyr Xu Quanzhi to disguise himself while carrying out underground revolutionary activities in the White areas. In terms of historical cultural relics, there are: pottery steamers, pottery dou (stemmed dish), stone adzes, stone knives and other production tools and daily necessities unearthed from the Shijiahe Neolithic site in Tianmen, bronze arrowheads, bronze knives and other objects unearthed from Yangjiawan in Huangpi during the Yin and Zhou dynasties, which are important materials for illustrating the relationship between Central Plains culture and the ethnic groups of Central and Southern China, exquisite tri-color porcelain wares unearthed from Tang tombs in the suburbs of Wuhan, and cultural relics unearthed from five tombs, including the tombs of the Chu capital, Warring States tombs, Three Kingdoms tombs, and Southern Qi tombs, which were cleared and excavated in various parts of Hubei.

    湖北精选一批文物分送革命博物馆、历史博物馆
    最近，湖北省博物馆、湖北省文物管理处和大革命时期湖北全省总工会纪念馆等单位，从历年征集和清理发掘的十多万件文物当中，精选了五百多件革命文物和历史文物，分送给中国革命博物馆和中国历史博物馆，以补充和丰富这两个博物馆的陈列内容。
    这些选送的文物，大都具有较高的历史价值或艺术价值。革命文物方面有：辛亥革命时期武昌城司令官颁发的木质城门出入证和纸质夜间口号条，第二次国内革命战争时期红军抢渡均县盐池河用过的炮绳，黄冈农民协会晚间开会用的马灯，抗日战争时期新四军第五师后方医院用过的破缸底和铁锅，以及徐全直烈士当年在白区进行地下革命活动用以化装掩蔽的绸上衣。历史文物方面有：天门石家河新石器时代遗址出土的陶甑、陶豆、石＠、石刀等生产工具和生活用具，黄陂杨家湾出土的殷周铜镞、铜刀等器物，它们是说明中原文化与中南民族关系的重要资料，武汉市郊唐墓出土的精美的三彩瓷器，以及在湖北各地清理发掘的楚都出土墓、战国墓、三国墓、南朝齐墓等五座墓葬的出土文物。  （刘长荪）
