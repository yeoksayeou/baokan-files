Premier Zhou Enlai's political report comprehensively summarized the tremendous achievements of our country's Great Leap Forward last year, and showcased the magnificent prospects for continuing the leap forward this year, giving us great encouragement. We wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's report.

Recently, the original Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, in order to maintain their dark rule and cruel exploitation, colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to launch an armed rebellion. This traitorous behavior not only undermines unity and national solidarity, but also seriously violates the interests of the 1.2 million people of Tibet, which the people of all ethnic groups in the country absolutely cannot tolerate. Our government has ordered the dissolution of the original Tibetan local government. With the active support of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, the troops of the Tibet Military Region have basically quelled the rebellion and controlled the situation in Tibet, paving the way for the emergence of a democratic and socialist new Tibet. This is a great victory for our country's policy of national unity, and we enthusiastically celebrate this victory! It is universally recognized that the Tibetan issue is purely an internal affair of our country and absolutely brooks no foreign interference. However, after the incident occurred, in addition to the imperialists who are hostile to the Chinese people and fear nothing more than chaos, who took the opportunity to stir up trouble and slander our country, some people in our great neighbor India have also been shouting and yelling, expressing sympathy and encouragement for the Tibetan rebel group, and slandering our country in tones identical to those of the imperialists. A few days ago, Indian diplomatic officials even distributed a so-called "Dalai Statement" full of loopholes and absurdities, raising the banner of so-called "Tibetan independence." This not only seriously violates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India, and undermines Sino-Indian friendly relations, but also cannot help but make people suspect whether the reactionary and expansionist elements in India want to rekindle their ambitions to inherit the legacy of British imperialism's aggression against Tibet, and whether they want to use this to curry favor with imperialism. However, the 650 million Chinese people have stood up like giants. The days when imperialists could arbitrarily carve up Chinese territory and interfere in China's internal affairs are gone forever. As friends of the Indian people, we must warn the expansionist elements in India not to let your heads get overheated again. Your crude and clumsy attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs will not damage our country's prestige, but will only ruin India's reputation in international affairs in recent years, causing India to fall into the trap of imperialism, and you yourselves will end up in disgrace and ruin. It will not benefit India itself or yourselves.

Here, we would also like to talk about our experiences with some examples of the Great Leap Forward on the cultural and educational front.

As everyone has seen, after the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, under the radiance of the general line for socialist construction, all cultural and educational undertakings have undergone great changes and taken on a new look. Not only has the quantity increased many times over, but the quality has also been greatly improved. As Premier Zhou said in his report: "We have, in accordance with the world outlook of the working class and the educational principles of socialism and communism, implemented the policy of education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor, thereby launching a great and profound revolution in education." Over the past year, the specific manifestations of the education revolution have been the elimination of the bourgeois education policy, the establishment of a deeply rooted socialist education policy, and the overcoming of the phenomena of detachment from politics, detachment from productive labor, and detachment from reality. In teaching, productive labor has been included in the teaching plan. The democratic and equal relationship between teachers and students is developing healthily. Schools at all levels have revised teaching plans and teaching outlines, adapted textbooks, and improved teaching methods, thereby improving the quality of teaching. All secondary schools and above are striving to realize the principle of combining teaching, scientific research, and productive labor, so that theory is closely linked with practice. Spare-time education has also developed greatly.

Just taking some of the situations we saw during our inspection in Shanghai as an example, they vividly reflect the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward in cultural and educational undertakings.

A total of 45,043 students are enrolled in Shanghai's 21 universities and colleges, of which 40,515 students participated in productive labor, accounting for 82% of the total number of students. They performed a total of 3,678,405 workdays. The average labor day per student per year was 91. The industrial output value reached 5,872,633.50 yuan, and the total agricultural output value reached 5,200,947 yuan. Students of the Shanghai Fisheries College participated in labor in combination with their major, and went to sea to fish a total of 1,038,199 jin, with an output value of 17,914 yuan. Since October last year, universities and colleges throughout the city have participated in the all-people steelmaking campaign, and have established 145 steelmaking furnaces in three months, producing 1,187 tons of steel. Through labor training, the vast number of teachers and students have received a profound education, and have initially developed the habit of participating in productive labor, and cultivated the thoughts and feelings of the working people.

In teaching work, all universities and colleges in the city, in addition to using the methods of big contending, big blooming, and big-character posters, also adopted the method of combining teachers, students, and leaders of the Party committee. According to statistics from 16 universities and colleges, more than 800 new teaching outlines and more than 400 textbooks were compiled. The Chinese Department of Fudan University compiled "A History of Chinese Literature" (Volume 1) for the second, third, and fourth grades, which was published at the beginning of the year, showing the growth of young intellectuals under the cultivation of the Party. The style of the new generation of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do has won praise and encouragement from all parties. The revision of all subject textbooks or teaching outlines has been discussed jointly by teachers and students. For example, "A History of Chinese Literature" was jointly discussed by the Chinese Departments of East China Normal University, Shanghai Normal College, and Fudan University, organized by the Higher Education Bureau. Academic discussion and the blossoming of a hundred schools of thought have become the norm. In the process of discussion and contention, both older and younger teachers have spoken freely, expressed their opinions, and adhered to the truth. In the new democratic and equal relationship between teachers and students, on the one hand, teachers have played a leading role under the leadership of the Party committee and under the principle of "teaching and learning from each other." At the same time, students have also played a creative role in learning, improved the quality of teaching, and promoted the healthy development of academic discussion.

In terms of spare-time education, in August and September last year, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee called on the entire Party to run schools, the entire people to run schools, everyone to work, and everyone to study, so as to popularize secondary education among young and middle-aged people in the city within ten years or more, and then to enable those who are qualified and willing to study to receive higher education. The Municipal Party Committee also pointed out that the current employee education should focus on the development of spare-time schools. In September and October, more than 6,200 spare-time schools were established. Among the 1.82 million employees in the city, 1.09 million entered spare-time schools. Methods of running schools have also been created, adapting to the needs of production and technical innovation, and formulating a consistent teaching plan that combines politics, culture, and technology. The school system is usually eight years, with four years for primary and junior high school, and two years each for senior high school and junior college. The "workshop-run school" system is implemented. Spare-time schools below junior high school are run by workshops, while junior college spare-time schools are run by factories or joint factories. The source of teachers is expanded by the method of "those who are able become teachers," and experienced veteran workers are invited to teach. There are now 67,240 part-time teachers, while there are only 7,871 full-time teachers. Many factories have completed the task of eliminating illiteracy and are carrying out secondary and junior college education and scientific literacy. For example, among the 2,800 employees of the Shanghai Smelter, there are only six illiterate people, and they are currently eliminating chemical illiteracy. Judging from the several units we inspected, the attendance rate of spare-time students is around 90%, and the workers' enthusiasm for learning is unprecedented. We believe that the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's call to "popularize secondary education among young and middle-aged people in the city in ten years" can definitely be realized as scheduled.

We also inspected the North Shanghai Suburban Middle School. This school is linked to the Continental Golden Pen Company, and senior high school students participate in labor in this factory. Each of the school's 28 classes invites an advanced worker as the deputy class teacher, who regularly comes to the school to participate in class meetings and conduct ideological education in order to cultivate students' moral character and the thoughts and feelings of the working class.

In addition, in terms of publishing, the number of new books published by Shanghai's publishing houses jumped from 2,934 in 1957 to 5,037. The number of books distributed jumped from 325 million copies in 1957 to 491 million copies. In terms of quality, due to the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's issuance of a notice strengthening publishing work last year, and the inspection conducted in July, publishing houses, under the leadership of the Party, vigorously implemented the policy of publishing serving politics, serving production, and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Publications were generally able to cooperate with the situation, connect with reality, closely serve production, and reverse the tendency of valuing the past over the present and valuing foreign over Chinese, so that the quality of publications has been improved to a certain extent.

Work on language reform and the promotion of Mandarin is underway. At present, commercial staff in Shanghai can basically use Mandarin, and all street signs have been added with Hanyu Pinyin.

Our observations are not extensive and are limited to Shanghai, but the examples we have seen with our own eyes can prove that our cultural and educational undertakings are progressing by leaps and bounds and are undergoing a thorough revolution.

Why did Shanghai's cultural and educational undertakings have such a Great Leap Forward last year? We think there are two most popular phrases that can be used to explain this, namely:

Of all the reasons, the Party's leadership is the most important;
Of all the difficulties, relying on the masses makes it easy!

Of course, the Great Leap Forward in cultural and educational undertakings has also brought many new problems, the most prominent of which is how to consolidate the achievements and continue to improve quality. The key to this lies in greatly accelerating the training of cultural and educational cadres to adapt to the leap-forward development of "one day equals twenty years." This is a long-term and relatively arduous task that requires us to work harder and more meticulously to do it well.

We are cultural and educational workers, and most of us are also elderly cultural and educational workers. We have been encouraged by the Party's teachings and the life of the new society since liberation, especially by the Great Leap Forward last year. We feel the same excitement of the leap forward as the younger generation, and we feel the joy of youth and the beautiful prospects of great potential. From our work practice in recent years, we have deeply realized the truth that educators must first be educated, and should, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in the long-term practice of future work," and maximize their socialist enthusiasm. The contrast between the old and new societies has given us extremely profound impressions. We deeply feel that all old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road not only have ample opportunities to contribute all their strength and exert their talents in the great era of the Great Leap Forward, but also, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, under the teachings of the Party and the arrangements of the state, it is entirely possible for them to boldly and unhesitatingly exert their creativity in their work and make unprecedented contributions. We sincerely thank the Party for encouraging our enthusiasm, and the Party for restoring our youth! We are "old in age but not in spirit." We are willing to learn from the strengths of young intellectuals, accept training together with young intellectuals in continuous leaps forward, and together with young intellectuals take up new ideological weapons on the socialist cultural and educational front to contribute all our strength to building a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture!

    文教事业的彻底革命
    刘思慕　苏步青　陈望道　陈建功　吴若安　金仲华  赵超构　
    舒新城　廖世承代表谈在上海视察的印象
    周恩来总理的政治报告全面总结了我国去年跃进的巨大成就，展示着今年继续跃进的壮丽前景，给我们以极大鼓舞。我们衷心地、热烈地拥护周总理的报告。
    最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团为了保持他们的黑暗的统治和残酷的剥削，竟然勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，发动武装叛乱。这种叛国行为不但破坏统一，破坏民族团结，而且严重地违背了西藏一百二十万人民的利益，全国各族人民绝对不能容忍。我政府已经下令解散原西藏地方政府，西藏军区部队在西藏僧俗人民的积极支持之下，已经基本上平息叛乱，控制了西藏的局势，为民主的社会主义的新西藏的出现铺平道路。这是我国民族团结政策的伟大胜利，我们为这胜利热烈欢呼！人所共认，西藏事件纯粹是我国的内政问题，绝对不容许外国干涉。但是，事件发生以后，除了敌视中国人民、唯恐天下不乱的帝国主义者借此兴风作浪，对我国大肆污蔑之外，在我们伟大的邻邦印度竟也有人大叫大嚷，对西藏叛乱集团表示同情和鼓励，对我国进行诽谤，其口吻与帝国主义一模一样。日前印度外交官员更散发了破绽百出、荒谬绝伦的所谓
  “达赖声明”，打出了所谓“西藏独立”的旗号。这就不但严重地违反了中印两国所共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则，破坏了中印友好关系，而且也不能不使人怀疑印度的反动派和扩张主义分子是否要重燃他们的继承英帝国主义侵略西藏的遗产的野心，是否要以此来博取帝国主义的欢心。但是，六亿五千万的中国人民已经像巨人般站立起来，帝国主义者任意割裂中国领土、干涉中国内政的时代已经一去不复返了。作为印度人民的朋友，我们要正告印度的扩张主义分子，你们的头脑不要再发热了吧。你们干涉中国内政的粗暴而拙劣的做法，无损于我国的威望，而只会败坏印度这些年来在国际事务中所赢得的声誉，使印度落入帝国主义的圈套，而自己也会落个身败名裂的下场，对于印度本身，对于你们自己都是没有什么好处的。
    在这里，我们还想就文教战线上的大跃进的一些事例，谈一谈我们的体会。
    大家看到：经过整风运动和反右斗争以后，在社会主义建设总路线的光芒照耀下，所有文化教育事业都起了很大的变化，出现了新的面貌。不仅是数量上成倍地发展，质量上也大大的提高。正如周总理报告中所说：“我们按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命。”这一年来，教育革命的具体表现是破除资产阶级的教育方针，确立了深入人心的社会主义教育方针，克服了脱离政治、脱离生产劳动、脱离实际的现象；在教学上，生产劳动已经列入教学计划；师生之间的民主平等关系正在健康地发展；各级学校修订了教学计划和教学大纲；改编了教材，改进了教学方法，从而提高了教学质量。所有中等以上学校都在努力实现教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合的原则，使理论与实际密切联系。业余教育也有很大发展。
    单就我们在上海视察当中看到的一些情况来说，同样生动地反映着文教事业的跃进气象。
    上海全市的二十一个高等学校的在校学生共计四万五千零四十三人，有四万零五百一十五人参加了生产劳动，占学生总数的百分之八十二；共做了三百六十七万八千四百零五个劳动日；全年平均每个学生的劳动日为九十一个。工业产值达五百八十七万二千六百三十三元五角，农业总产值达五百二十万零九千四百七十元。上海水产学院学生结合专业参加劳动，出海捕鱼共达一百零三万八千一百九十九斤，产值一万七千九百一十四元。从去年十月开始，全市高等学校参加全民炼钢，三个月中共建立了炼钢炉一百四十五座，产钢一千一百八十七吨。通过劳动锻炼，广大师生受到了深刻的教育，初步养成了参加生产劳动的习惯，培养了劳动人民的思想感情。
  在教学工作中，全市各高等学校除运用大鸣大放大字报的方法外，并且采取在党委领导下的教师、学生三结合的方法。据十六所高等学校的统计，新编教学大纲八百余份，教材四百余份。复旦大学中文系二、三、四年级合编“中国文学史”（上卷）已于年初出版，显示着青年知识分子在党的培养下的成长；新生一代的敢想敢说敢做的风格，博得各方的赞扬和勉励。各科教材或教学大纲的修编，都经过师生共同讨论，如“中国文学史”并由高教局组织华东师大、上海师范学院和复旦大学三校中文系联合进行讨论。学术讨论，百家争鸣，成为风气；在讨论争鸣过程中，老年教师、青年教师都做到了畅所欲言，各抒己见，坚持真理。在师生民主平等的新关系中，一方面教师在党委领导下，在“教学相长”的原则下，发挥了主导作用，同时学生也在学习上发挥了创造性，提高了教学质量，推动学术讨论的健康发展。
    在业余教育方面，去年八、九月间上海市委号召全党办学，全民办学，人人劳动，人人学习，在十年或更多一些时间内，首先在全市青壮年中普及中等教育，以后再使有条件的和自愿学习的受到高等教育；市委并指出目前职工教育应以发展业余学校为主。在九、十两个月间，就办起了六千二百多所业余学校；在全市一百八十二万职工之中，有一百零九万人进了业余学校。办学方法，也有所创造，适应着生产需要和技术革新的要求，制订出政治、文化、技术三结合的一贯制教学计划。学制通常为八年，小学、初中共四年，高中、大专各二年；实行“车间办学”，初中以下的业余学校由车间办理，大专业余学校则由厂办或联厂办理，以“能者为师”的方法扩大师资的来源，请老年有经验的工人担任教课。现在共有业余教师六万七千二百四十人，而专职教师不过七千八百七十一人。许多工厂的扫盲任务已完成，正在进行中等和大专教育以及科学扫盲；例如上海冶炼厂的二千八百名职工中，文盲只有六个人，目前正在扫化学盲。就我们视察的几个单位来看，业余学生的出席率均在百分之九十上下，工人们的好学之风是前所未有的。我们相信上海市委的“十年普及全市青壮年的中等教育”的号召一定可以如期实现。
    我们还视察过上海北郊中学。这个学校和大陆金笔公司挂钩，高中学生都到这个厂里参加劳动；全校二十八个班，每个班请一位先进工人作副班主任，经常到校参加班会进行思想教育，以培养学生的道德品质和工人阶级的思想感情。
    此外，在出版方面，上海各出版社出版的新书由一九五七年的二千九百三十四种跃进到五千零三十七种；图书发行数由一九五七年的三亿二千五百万册，跃进到四亿九千一百万册。在质量上，由于上海市委上年发出了加强出版工作的通知，七月又进行检查，各出版社在党的领导下大力贯彻出版事业为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的方针，出版物一般能配合形势，联系实际，密切为生产服务，扭转了厚古薄今和轻中重外的倾向，使得出版物的质量有了一定的提高。
    文字改革和推广普通话的工作正在开展中。目前，上海的商业工作人员基本上能运用普通话，所有路牌都加上了汉语拼音。
    我们的所见不广，而且只限于上海一地，但就亲眼看到的这些事例来说，也可以证明我们的文教事业正在飞跃进展，正在经历着一个彻底的革命。
    为什么去年上海的文教事业有这样的大跃进？我们以为有两句最流行的话，可以代为解释，那就是：
    千条万条，党的领导第一条；
    千难万难，依靠群众便不难！
    当然，文教事业的大跃进也带来了许多新问题，其中最突出的问题是如何巩固已有成就和继续提高质量，而其关键则在于大量地加速地培养文教干部，以适应“一天等于二十年”的飞跃发展。这是一个长时期存在而又是比较艰巨的工作，需要我们更加努力更加细致地把它做好。
    我们是文教工作者，多数还是老年的文教工作者。我们受到解放以来的党的教导和新社会的生活、特别是去年大跃进的鼓舞，我们同青年一辈同样的感到跃进的兴奋，感到青春的喜悦和大有可为的美好前景。从我们近几年来的工作实践中，深刻地体会到教育者必须先受教育这一个真理，应当按照周总理报告中所指示的：“继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造”，最大限度地提高自己的社会主义积极性。新旧社会的对比给我们极为深刻的印象；我们深深地感到一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，在大跃进的伟大时代里，不仅有充分的机会可以贡献他们的全部力量，发挥他们的才能，并且在马克思列宁主义的指引下，在党的教导和国家的安排下，完全有可能雄心勃勃地当仁不让地发挥工作上的创造性，做出前所未有的贡献来。我们衷心地感谢着：党，鼓舞着我们的干劲，党，使我们恢复了青春！我们“年老心不老”，我们愿意学习青年知识分子的长处，同青年知识分子一起在不断跃进中接受锻炼，同青年知识分子一起在社会主义的文教战线上拿起新的思想武器，为建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而贡献全部的力量！
