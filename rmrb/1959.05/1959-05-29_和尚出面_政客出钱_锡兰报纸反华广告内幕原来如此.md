Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, May 25th. The bi-weekly "Forward" revealed in its May 22nd issue that the huge advertising fee for the "Daily Sun's" announcement on the 21st that the Ceylon "Buddhist Monks Association" would hold a public gathering in Colombo on May 31st, was paid by former United National Party Minister J.R. Jayewardene with a personal check for seven hundred rupees to the pro-Western Lake House newspaper trust.

As previously reported, the advertisement, which took up about half a page, included a slanderous headline: "Mass Meeting of Monks and Laity to Discuss What Countermeasures Should be Taken Against the Communist Army's Massive Elimination of Tibetan Monks." The bi-weekly also said: "What this new association is trying to save is not Buddhism, but the United National Party."

    和尚出面　政客出钱
    锡兰报纸反华广告内幕原来如此
    新华社科伦坡25日电　在5月22日出版的一期“前进”双周刊透露，“每日太阳报”在21日登载的宣布锡兰“佛教僧侣协会”将在5月31日在科伦坡举行公众集会的巨幅广告费，是由前统一国民党部长杰·鲁·贾雅瓦德尼以七百卢比的个人支票付给亲西方的湖滨大厦报业托辣斯的。
    前已报道，在这则约占半页篇幅的广告上，包括一个诬蔑性的标题：“讨论对共军大事消灭西藏僧侣应采取何种对策的僧俗群众大会”。这家双周刊又说：“这个新协会企图挽救的不是佛教，而是统一国民党。”
