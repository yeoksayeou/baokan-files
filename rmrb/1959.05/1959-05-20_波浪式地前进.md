Advancing in Waves

    Although things in the world vary in thousands of ways, they share a wave-like pattern of movement. "No contradiction, no world"; the struggle of contradictions is the fundamental driving force for the development of things. The mutual transformation of the contradictory sides causes things to display tortuosity in their development process. With just a little attention, you can find thousands upon thousands of such examples in life: when walking, one always takes a step with the left foot, then the right foot; if one tries to step with both feet at the same time, one is sure to fall. In battle, one always fights a battle, rests for a while, and then throws oneself into a new battle; if one keeps fighting continuously, one will inevitably become exhausted and suffer defeat. And so on.

    Advancing in waves is an objective law. Since it is a law, we must honestly acknowledge it. However, some people think that doing so is too slow and deliberate. They think that since it is a Great Leap Forward, it should be a "straight advance" and a "linear rise." What is a Great Leap Forward? To leap is to jump; of course, it is not to stroll or sway slowly. But if one wants to jump, and jump far and high, one must first stand firm, and even take a step back, before jumping forward again. In 1922, when the Soviet Union changed from military communism to the New Economic Policy, Lenin said this: "We are now retreating, as if taking a step backward, but we are doing this in order to take a few steps back first, and then run and jump forward more vigorously." Isn't this exactly the case with our country's Great Leap Forward? The No. 2 furnace in Sheng County, which created the highest utilization coefficient record in the province, originally only produced three tons a day. The workers sat down to study, use their brains, and find solutions. After changing the wind pressure and raising the furnace temperature, the output increased from three tons to seven tons. The workers then sat down again to find loopholes and seize key points, and after taking corresponding measures, the output increased from seven tons to eight tons. The Cixi Wudongzha Commune, after working hard for fourteen days, rested happily for a day, and then plunged into new labor, and the efficiency was greatly improved. Working and thinking, hard struggle and rest, development and consolidation, are transformed into each other in this way, promoting the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. But some people ask: Isn't it faster to advance straight ahead? This cannot be generalized; it depends on whether it is possible. A "straight advance" that violates objective laws may seem fast, but in reality it is slow. If the No. 2 furnace in Sheng County only worked and did not think, it would not be able to summarize experiences and lessons, it would not be able to promote strengths and block loopholes, and as a result, it would not only be impossible to increase production step by step, but it might even reduce production. If the Cixi Wudongzha Commune only struggled hard and did not rest, people's energy would be limited after all. Over time, it would inevitably affect their health, and not only would it not improve efficiency, but it would also reduce efficiency. Objective laws are so merciless. If you are unwilling to advance in waves, it will force you to take a bigger detour. People who one-sidedly demand a "linear rise" can only achieve the opposite of what they want.

    Some people worry that our wave-like advance will become a shield for conservatives. Indeed, when we carry out rectification after each major development, those conservatives ridicule us in every possible way, saying things like "correcting deviations," "opposing rash advances," and so on. But we are not afraid. Because "the waves behind the Yangtze River push the waves ahead," and each wave is higher than the last. The "down" of the previous wave is precisely to prepare conditions for the "up" of the greater wave behind it. Isn't that so? When you take your second step with your left foot, you have already moved forward two steps. An army that has rested will fight an even more beautiful battle. In a word, our "down" is not the goal, but the means; it is not to oppose rash advances, but to strive for continued leap forward.

    The law of advancing in waves is an important art of leadership. This law requires us to foresee the tortuous development process of things, and at the appropriate time, consciously guide the movement to the necessary tortuous direction to prevent being overzealous; but also at the appropriate time, raise the movement to a higher stage.

### 波浪式地前进

    波浪式地前进
    世界上的事物，虽然千差万别，五花八门，但它们却有着一个波浪式的运动规律，“没有矛盾就没有世界”，矛盾的斗争是事物发展的根本动力。矛盾双方的相互转化，就使事物在其发展过程中显示出曲折性来。只要你稍一留神，就可以从生活里找出成千上万这样的例子来；走路，总是跨出左脚，再跨出右脚，如果一起跨出去，就一定要摔跟斗；打仗，总是打了一仗，休整一会，再投入新的战斗，如果一直打下去，就非弄得疲于奔命，吃败仗不可，……等等。
    波浪式地前进是一条客观规律。是规律，就要老老实实的承认。但是有些人却认为这样做太慢条斯理了。他们认为：大跃进么，就应该“笔直前进”、“直线上升”。什么是大跃进呢？跃者，跳也，当然不是踱八字步、慢吞吞地摇来摆去。但是，若要跳，并且跳得远、跳得高，就要先站稳脚跟，甚至还要向后退一点，才能再往前跳去。1922年，当苏联由军事共产主义改行新经济政策的一年以后，列宁曾这样说：“我们现在退却，好像是在向后退，但是我们这样作是为了先向后退几步，然后再快跑，更有力地向前跳。”我国的大跃进事实不正是如此吗？创利用系数全省最高纪录的嵊县二号炉，原来日产只三吨，工人们坐下来研究研究，动脑筋，想办法，改变风压，提高炉温以后，就由三吨升高为七吨，工人们又坐下来找漏洞抓环节，采取相应措施以后，产量又由七吨提高到八吨；慈溪五洞闸公社，在劳动十四天之后，热热闹闹欢欢喜喜地休息了一天，再投入新的劳动，效率就大大提高；干与想，苦战与休整，发展与巩固，就是这样相互转化着，推动工农业生产不断跃进的。但是有人问：笔直前进是不是更快呢？这不能一概而论，得看有没有可能。违背客观规律的
  “笔直前进”，看来是快了，实则是慢了。如果嵊县二号炉只干不想，就不能总结经验教训，就不能发扬优点，堵塞漏洞，结果不但不可能步步增产，甚至还可能减产。如果慈溪五洞闸公社只苦战不休整，人的精力终是有限的，时间一长，必将影响健康，不但不能提高效率，反而要降低效率。客观规律就是这样无情，你不肯波浪式地前进，它会逼使你走更大的弯路。片面地要求“直线上升”的人，结果只能事与愿违，适得其反。
    有人担心我们的波浪式前进，会成为保守派的挡箭牌。的确，当我们每一次大发展之后进行整顿时，那些保守派就百般嘲讽，说什么“纠偏”啦，“反冒进”啦，等等。但是我们并不怕。因为“长江后浪推前浪”，一浪高一浪；前浪的“伏”，正是为更大的后浪的“起”准备条件。不是吗？当你第二次跨出左脚时，你已经前进了两步了；休整以后的军队，将会打出一个更加漂亮的仗来。一句话，我们的“伏”，不是目的，而是手段，不是反冒进，而是为了争取继续跃进。
    波浪式前进的规律，是一门重要的领导艺术。这规律要求我们预见事物的曲折发展过程，在适当时机，自觉地把运动引到必要的曲折的方向去，防止操之过急；但是也要在适当时机，把运动提高到更高的阶段。
