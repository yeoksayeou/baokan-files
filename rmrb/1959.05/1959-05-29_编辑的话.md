    Editor's Note
    The vast countryside is currently engaged in summer harvesting and planting, while also busy with field management. Agricultural activities are at a crucial juncture. Many tasks must be done simultaneously and with greater speed and quality. Achieving faster and more timely results, along with improved precision, is essential for a better harvest.
    To achieve speed and quality, leadership must strengthen its work in two aspects: Firstly, under the leadership of the Party, launch a large-scale mass movement, resolutely adhering to the mass line; all indicators and measures should be discussed with the masses. Secondly, strengthen the responsibility system, ensuring that all agricultural activities are conducted in an orderly manner and with designated personnel in charge.
    These two aspects are inseparable. Without a responsibility system, the achievements of the mass movement cannot be consolidated. The responsibility system must also be established on the foundation of the mass line to be truly effective and implemented.
    To achieve speed and quality from a technical standpoint, it is necessary to grasp the growth patterns of crops and utilize various clever methods for water and fertilizer application, tool innovation, and so on. To accomplish these tasks effectively, the mass line and the responsibility system are also indispensable.
    The news, communications, and commentaries published on this page today primarily discuss early rice field management and summer harvesting. The spirit of adhering to the mass line and strengthening the responsibility system, which permeates these discussions, is also applicable to other agricultural activities.

    广大农村目前正在一面忙夏收夏种，一面忙田间管理，农事活动正在紧要关头。许多工作同时要做，都要做得更快更好。更快更及时，更好更细致，才能得到更好的收成。
  要又快又好，从领导方面说，得从两方面加强工作：一方面是在党的领导下大搞群众运动，坚决走群众路线；一切指标，一切措施，都同群众商量。另方面是加强责任制度，使一切农事活动都进行得井井有条，都有专人负责。
    这两方面是不可分割的。没有责任制度，就不能巩固群众运动的成果；责任制度也必须是在群众路线的基础上产生的，才可能真正有效地贯彻执行。
    要又快又好，从技术方面来说，要掌握作物的生长规律，要用各种巧办法用水用肥、改革工具，等等。而要做好这些，同群众路线和责任制度也是分不开的。
    今天本版发表的消息、通讯和评论，主要是谈早稻田间管理和夏收工作的。其中贯串着的走群众路线和加强责任制的精神，则是在别的各项农事活动中也都适用的。
