The People in Yulin and Wuzhou Special zones are enthusiastic in learning science.
(Our newspaper's Nanning dispatch on the 17th) Many farmers in the Guidongnan Plain of Guangxi are bringing into play the spirit of diligent study and have gradually learned to use scientific principles to guide agricultural production.

The Guidongnan Plain includes the Yulin and Wuzhou special zones. The farmers here have a great interest in learning science. According to statistics from six counties, including Yulin, Guixian, and Pingnan, there are more than 1,800 agricultural science research groups voluntarily organized by rural youth and farmers. The research content includes agricultural seasonal activities, fertilizer manufacturing, soil analysis, variety cultivation, hybridization and grafting, improved breeding of poultry and livestock, and tool reform. The Zhangmu Youth Farm in Cenxi County focuses on large-scale high-yield production and carries out scientific and technological research activities. They have established a total of seven research and experiment bases. They study diligently and are linked with local technology promotion stations, regularly inviting technicians to impart scientific and technological knowledge and employing technicians as consultants. The Youth Shock Brigade of the Shangyou Commune in Cenxi County has hired Jiang Shaofang, a well-known young expert in improved varieties in Guangxi, as a correspondence instructor. Farmers in the Tanglong Brigade of the Dongping Commune in Bobai County, under the guidance of technicians, are currently studying fertilizer combination and prevention of rice lodging.

The vast rural youth and farmers in the Guidongnan Plain also combine the scientific knowledge they have learned with their own production experience and apply it to practice to guide production. After learning to identify the structure and properties of the soil, the Youth High-Yield Team of the Liuchen Commune in Pingnan County was able to propose methods for improving the soil based on soil analysis when deep plowing the land to improve the soil last winter and this spring. When accumulating and making fertilizers, after studying the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, they used local methods to create potassium fertilizer, mixed fertilizer, yeast fertilizer, and heat-preserving fertilizer to meet the different needs of the seedlings at each stage of growth. This youth high-yield team also used wild plants to boil more than a dozen kinds of indigenous pesticides, preparing early to prevent pests and diseases. The Agricultural Science Research Station of the Mengjiang Commune in Tengxian County has successfully achieved asexual hybridization of peanuts and kidney beans, eggplants and peppers. Asexual hybridization of chickens and geese has been successful. The six hybrid chickens hatched are very similar to geese in characteristics, with thick and slightly higher legs, fine feathers, large body, and drooping abdomen, heavier and larger than chickens that have not been hybridized.

    玉林梧州两专区农民热心学科学
    本报南宁17日电　广西桂东南平原的许多农民，发挥勤奋学习的精神，已经逐步学会运用科学道理来指导农业生产。
    桂东南平原包括玉林、梧州两个专区。这里的农民学习科学的兴趣很大，据玉林、贵县、平南等六个县的统计，由农村青年和农民自觉组织起来的农业科学研究小组就有一千八百多个。研究内容有农事季节活动，肥料制造，土壤分析，品种培植，杂交嫁接，禽畜良种繁殖，工具改革等。岑溪县樟木青年农场以大面积丰产为中心，开展科学技术研究活动，他们一共搞了七个研究试验基地。他们勤奋学习，并且与当地技术推广站挂钩，定期请技术员传授科学技术知识，并聘请技术员当顾问。岑溪县上游公社青年突击大队，聘请广西著名的良种青年专家蒋少芳作函授指导。博白县东平公社塘龙大队的农民在技术员指导下，目前正在研究肥素搭配和防水稻倒伏等问题。
    桂东南平原广大农村青年和农民，还把学到的科学知识和自己的生产经验结合起来运用到实际中去指导生产。平南县六陈公社青年丰产队学会了识别土壤的结构和性质后，在去冬今春深翻地改良土壤时，就能根据土壤分析提出改良土壤办法。在积制肥料时，他们研究了肥料的氮、磷、钾三要素之后，就利用土办法造出钾肥、混合肥、酵母肥和保温肥，以适应禾苗各个生长期的不同需要。这个青年丰产队还利用野生植物熬制了十多种土农药，提早准备预防病虫害。藤县蒙江公社农业科学研究站，把花生和菜豆、茄子和辣椒等进行无性杂交已经成活。鸡鹅无性杂交已获得成功，孵出的六只杂种鸡，很像鹅的性状，脚粗大、稍高、羽毛细、体大、腹部下垂，比没有杂交过的鸡重且大。
