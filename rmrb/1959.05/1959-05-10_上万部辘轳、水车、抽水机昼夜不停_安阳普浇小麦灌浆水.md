　　Tens of Thousands of Windlasses, Waterwheels, and Pumps Work Day and Night
    Anyang Universally Irrigates Wheat with Grouting Water
    (Our newspaper reports) People's communes in Anyang County, Henan Province, are actively and universally irrigating wheat with grouting water. Three thousand five hundred large and small canals are releasing water in every direction, and more than ten thousand windlasses, waterwheels, and pumps are working day and night. In just ten days, from April 22nd to May 2nd, 144,000 mu of wheat were irrigated, accounting for 40% of the area to be irrigated.
    Before the large-scale irrigation of wheat with grouting water, each commune and team conducted field soil moisture inspections and summarized past experiences and lessons. They reversed the erroneous thinking of some people who believed that since the jointing water had just been irrigated, it didn't matter whether or not the grouting water was irrigated, and quickly set off a high tide of universal irrigation. The Party branch of the Dengta Brigade of the Qugou Commune, targeting the erroneous thinking of some team leaders and members who thought that second and third-class wheat were "not dry" and that first-class wheat would lodge if irrigated, organized twelve squad leaders and some old farmers to go to the fields to check the soil moisture and discuss and study, so that everyone could specifically recognize that irrigation work must be timely. After the inspection and improved understanding, the team mobilized 150 people the next day, opening sluices on the canals to release water, and installed 15 waterwheels to carry out the wheat irrigation movement. The He Guantun Brigade of the Guocun Commune, at a meeting of commune members, used the example of old commune member Su Kun, who had five mu of wheat that was timely irrigated with grouting water before the cooperativization, yielding 213 jin per mu, while two mu of wheat under the same conditions only yielded 161 jin per mu because it was irrigated with grouting water one less time, to educate the masses. Based on this, they calculated an increase in production from irrigation: calculated at a minimum increase of 15 jin per mu, all 1,339 mu of wheat in the team could increase production by more than 20,000 jin if timely and universally irrigated with grouting water. Everyone saw the importance of irrigating wheat at the heading and grouting stages from this example and calculation. Commune member Han Zhongtian said: "Irrigating one more time increases production so much, why shouldn't we do it!" So he immediately put forward the slogan "Don't let go of a furrow, don't miss a single plant, irrigate every ridge, and guarantee a bumper harvest." After the meeting, the whole team mobilized a total of 225 people, digging a one and a half li long canal in one afternoon, and installed twelve sets of windlasses, irrigating 425 mu of wheat in five days.
    In the movement to universally irrigate wheat with grouting water, each commune promoted a production responsibility system with "contracting" and "fixing" as the main methods, ensuring fast irrigation progress and good quality. The Yuan Taibao Brigade of the Xincun Commune implemented "four contracts" (brigade contracts to team, team contracts to work group, work group contracts to wheat square, commune member contracts to land plot) and "five fixings" (fixing land plot, attendance, time, quality, work points) in this wheat irrigation. The whole team divided into eleven small teams, twenty-two work groups, and twenty-four wheat squares, contracting 1,533 mu of wheat fields level by level. From April 24th, it took five days to irrigate these wheat fields.

### 上万部辘轳、水车、抽水机昼夜不停  安阳普浇小麦灌浆水

　　上万部辘轳、水车、抽水机昼夜不停
    安阳普浇小麦灌浆水
    本报讯　河南安阳县各人民公社，积极普浇小麦灌浆水，三千五百条大、小渠道条条放水，一万多部辘轳、水车、抽水机昼夜不停，仅从4月22日到5月2日的十天中，就浇麦十四万四千亩，占应浇面积的40％。
    大浇小麦灌浆水之前，各社、队都进行田间查墒，总结过去经验教训，扭转了部分人认为刚浇过拔节水，灌浆水浇不浇没关系等错误思想，而迅速掀起普浇水高潮。曲沟公社灯塔大队党支部针对部分队长、社员对二、三类麦认为“不旱”，对一类麦怕浇了倒伏的错误思想，组织十二个小队长和部分老农下地，边检查墒情、边讨论研究，让大家具体认识浇水工作必须适时赶上。经过查看，提高认识后，第二天这个队就出动一百五十人，一面在渠上开闸放水，一面又安上十五部水车，开展了浇麦运动。郭村公社何官屯大队，在社员大会上以老社员苏坤在合作化前一年有五亩小麦适时浇了灌浆水，每亩收麦二百一十三斤，同样条件的二亩小麦因少浇一次灌浆水，每亩只收一百六十一斤为实例，向群众进行了教育。并以此算了一笔浇水增产账：按最低每亩增产十五斤算，全队一千三百三十九亩小麦，能适时普浇一次灌浆水，就可增产二万多斤。大家从这个实例和算账上看到了浇小麦抽穗、灌浆水的重要性。社员韩中田说：“多浇一水，就增产那么多，咱为啥不干！”于是当场提出“一垅不放，一棵不漏，畦畦浇到，保证丰收”的口号。会后，全队共出动二百二十五人，一下午挖成一条一里半长的渠道，并安上十二挂辘轳，五天浇麦四百二十五亩。
    普浇小麦灌浆水的运动中，各公社推行了以“包”、“定”为主要方法的生产责任制，保证了浇水进度快、质量好。辛村公社袁太保大队，在这次浇麦中实行了“四包”（大队包小队，小队包作业组，作业组包小麦方，社员包地块）、“五定”（定地块、出勤、时间、质量、工分），全队逐级分包了十一个小队、二十二个作业组、二十四块小麦方，一千五百三十三亩麦田，从4月24日开始后五天，浇完了这些小麦田。
