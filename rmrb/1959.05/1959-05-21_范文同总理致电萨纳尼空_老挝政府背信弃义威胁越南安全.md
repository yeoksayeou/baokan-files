Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 20th: Pham Van Dong, Premier and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram on the 19th to Phoui Sananikone, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, again strongly protesting the Lao Kingdom government's serious violations of the Geneva Accords. The full text of the telegram is as follows:
To His Excellency Phoui Sananikone, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos,

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful neighborliness towards the Kingdom of Laos, cannot continue to remain indifferent to the dangerous situation that has arisen on the Republic's border.

Firstly, I would like to remind you that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a signatory to the Geneva Accords on Laos, and in view of its responsibilities, has repeatedly condemned the Lao Kingdom government, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, for deliberately and increasingly violating the Geneva Accords, seriously damaging the peace of Laos and Indochina.

As everyone knows, the military clauses of the Geneva Accords are being dangerously and continuously violated: U.S. imperialists are arbitrarily transporting new weapons and military personnel into Laos, equipping and establishing military facilities to turn Laos into a U.S. military base, and preparing to effectively drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. At the same time, personnel from the South Vietnamese authorities can, in fact, freely conduct espionage and provocative activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from Lao territory. This means that the agents of U.S. imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities are carrying out hostile activities that endanger the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Lao territory, which shares a thousand-kilometer-long border with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

On the other hand, the Lao Kingdom government, in open violation of the Geneva Accords and the agreements concluded between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces, is constantly intensifying the suppression of former resistance members, subjecting them to illegal arrests and maltreatment, thereby completely abandoning all promises and guarantees made by the Kingdom government regarding the democratic freedoms of former resistance members. These extraordinary acts of reprisal have recently escalated to an unprecedentedly serious nature: the former Pathet Lao fighting forces stationed in Xieng Khouang and Luang Prabang are being threatened with disarmament and disbandment by Kingdom government forces that are far superior in number and heavily equipped; local leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front have been detained, and party leaders, including Prince Souphanouvong, have been placed under close surveillance in their own homes.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, bearing the obligations as a signatory to the Geneva Accords, once again lodges a strong protest against the increasingly serious violations of the Geneva Accords, which are a threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Lao Kingdom government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences that may arise from these actions.

    范文同总理致电萨纳尼空
    老挝政府背信弃义威胁越南安全
    新华社河内20日电　越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同在19日打电报给老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空，再次强硬抗议老挝王国政府严重违反日内瓦协议的行为。电报全文如下：越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同致王国首相培·萨纳尼空阁下：
    一向对老挝王国执行和平睦邻政策的越南民主共和国政府，对于在共和国边境上已经产生的危险局势不能继续漠不关心。
    首先，我谨提醒你注意，越南民主共和国政府作为关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的签署者，鉴于自己的责任，曾经多次谴责老挝王国政府在美帝国主义的指使下，故意日益加紧违反日内瓦协议，严重损害老挝和印度支那的和平。
    大家知道，日内瓦协议的军事条款正在危险地继续遭到违反：美帝国主义者随意把新式武器和军事人员运进老挝，为把老挝变为美国军事基地装备和建立了军事设施，准备在实际上把老挝拉入东南亚条约组织。同时，南越当局的人员事实上可以完全自由地从老挝领土上对越南民主共和国进行间谍和挑衅活动。这就是说，美帝国主义和南越当局的特务在同越南民主共和国拥有一千公里共同边界的老挝领土上，进行了危及越南民主共和国安全的敌对活动。
    另一方面，老挝王国政府公然违反日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队缔结的协议，不断加紧镇压前抗战人员，对他们进行非法逮捕和虐待，从而彻底废弃了王国政府作出的有关前抗战人员的民主自由权利的一切诺言和保证。上述异乎寻常的报复行为最近几天来已经发展到带有空前严重的性质：驻扎在川圹和琅勃拉邦的前寮国战斗部队正受到在数量上比自己多得多、拥有强大装备的王国政府部队予以缴械和解散的威胁，老挝爱国党的地方领导人遭到拘禁，包括苏发努冯亲王在内的党的领袖也在他们自己的住宅中被置于严密的监视之下。
    负有作为日内瓦协议签字国的义务的越南民主共和国政府对于日益严重地违反日内瓦协议的行为，再次提出强硬的抗议，这些行为是对越南民主共和国的安全的威胁；越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝王国政府必须对这种行为可能引起的一切后果负完全的责任。
