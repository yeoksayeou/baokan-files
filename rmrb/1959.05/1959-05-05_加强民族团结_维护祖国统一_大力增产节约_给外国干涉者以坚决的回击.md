Xinhua News Agency, May 4th. Youths in various parts of the country are commemorating the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement with practical actions.

In Beijing, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, commemorative activities were held everywhere today. Many factories, mines, people's communes, schools, and government offices held commemorative meetings, and many units invited veteran revolutionaries and heroic figures to meet with the youth. Eighty-three advanced youth collectives and one hundred and twenty-five outstanding youths were commended and rewarded at commemorative meetings in various units. Many universities and scientific research institutions held academic discussions today. More than 400 youths from all walks of life held a relay race in front of Tiananmen Square at night, holding high torches. Many units throughout the city held bonfire parties and gatherings. Tonight, youth students from Peking University held a large team day of more than 6,000 people at their newly built "May Fourth" sports field, with bonfires and torches burning brightly and songs resounding loudly. Dozens of outstanding youths solemnly swore to join the League on this night full of revolutionary spirit. The Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace held a recitation of outstanding works since the "May Fourth" period tonight. The university student choir sang revolutionary songs such as "Defend the Yellow River" at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall. The Beijing Library and the Capital Library held photo and book exhibitions commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement today.

Three thousand people from all walks of life and youth in Shanghai held a grand rally and garden party on the afternoon of the 3rd to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. The commemorative meeting was held at the Hongkou Stadium.

Shi Ximin, alternate secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, encouraged the youth in his report at the meeting to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement, cherish the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people a hundredfold, consciously shoulder the responsibility of accelerating socialist construction, and always stand at the forefront of socialist construction.

In his report, Shi Ximin sternly condemned the blatant provocative acts against our country by imperialists and Indian expansionists on the Tibet issue. He said that the conspiracy of imperialists and foreign reactionaries to split Tibet from our country is bound to be completely defeated. Zhang Haobo, deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and others who spoke at the meeting all denounced the despicable conspiracy of imperialists and foreign reactionaries on the Tibet issue, and believed that Nehru's speech on the Tibet issue in the Indian People's Chamber seriously distorted the truth of the Tibetan rebellion and was unacceptable to the people and youth of Shanghai.

At the meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League announced the awarding of the title of Red Flag Youth Shock Worker or Red Flag Youth Shock Team to 138 advanced youths and 57 advanced youth groups on all fronts in the city, commended 78 outstanding youths and two advanced collectives, and awarded them "May Fourth" medals on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

Youth workers from all districts of the city sent 1,865 production success reports to the conference via relay sticks in fourteen routes. At this time, gongs and drums were played in unison, and the entire audience stood up and cheered and paid tribute to the workers who created these outstanding achievements.

At the same time, a colorful garden party was held in Hongkou Park, which is close to the conference venue. Ten thousand youths from all walks of life spent a pleasant afternoon here.

More than 5,000 youths from all walks of life in Guangzhou held a commemorative meeting at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall this morning. The meeting called on the youth from all walks of life to inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the revolutionary predecessors since the "May Fourth" Movement, to fear no hardships, not be afraid of difficulties, and persevere in struggling for the cause of socialism and communism. The meeting also warmly celebrated the great victory of suppressing the rebellion in Tibet, and solemnly warned the Indian interventionists: Any conspiracy to support the Tibetan rebels to interfere in our country's internal affairs is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country, and it is bound to suffer a shameful defeat. The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and various districts held meetings to commend outstanding youths and advanced youth units on various fronts since the Great Leap Forward last year. The commended and rewarded youths stated that they would guard against arrogance and impetuosity, continue to exert their efforts, and create greater achievements.

More than 4,000 youth representatives in Chongqing also held a commemorative meeting this afternoon. Sixteen youth red flag collectives and forty youth red flag bearers who emerged in the recent city-wide youth red flag week movement were commended at the meeting. They devoted themselves to the production increase and economy practice movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution with tenacious revolutionary vigor, and made outstanding achievements. For example, Qin Guangjin, a young fitter at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, a technical innovation expert, realized more than 470 technical innovations from last year to the first quarter of this year. He encountered more than a dozen to dozens of failures for each technical innovation, but he never gave up. He often encouraged himself: "One more failure is one step closer to success." This year, he also went to other workshops and other factories to help his counterparts realize more than 60 technical innovations. The Chen Wantang youth driving team, which often runs on the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, overcame numerous difficulties such as few vehicles and dangerous mountain roads, and transported a large number of pig iron and steel to support key projects. In February this year, the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway was muddy and slippery due to heavy snow, but the team braved the wind and snow, with each car carrying a trailer, crossing the Lou Mountain Pass, and transporting a large amount of manganese sand and pig iron from Guizhou to Chongqing. At the commemorative meeting, youth workers, farmers, students, representatives of the literary and art circles, and representatives of the troops all spoke. They expressed their determination to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement and dedicate their youth to the great cause of communism. They also unanimously condemned the shameful acts of imperialism and Indian interventionists in supporting the Tibetan rebels and attempting to split the unity of our country.

More than 3,000 youths from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City held a commemorative meeting on the morning of the 3rd. At the meeting, a group of advanced youth figures and advanced youth collectives were commended by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. Among these advanced figures and collectives were Wang Nanlou, a young worker from the Jiangsu Machine Factory who created and innovated 90 tools and completed a year's workload in 60 days; Wu Xiulun's class of the Quantai Work Area under the Xuzhou Jianjing Company, who created a new national tunneling record for eight consecutive times; and the porcelain workshop of the Nanjing Radio Factory, which completed the entire year's workload for 1959 as early as April 19, with 98% of the workers in this workshop being young people. In the afternoon of the same day, more than 40,000 young people held a lake tour and gathering at the scenic Xuanwu Lake to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement.

More than 6,000 youth representatives from all walks of life in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, and the Fuzhou troops of the People's Liberation Army held commemorative meetings at the Fuzhou Workers' Cultural Palace, military clubs, and other places on the evening of the 3rd.

For more than a month, youths on all fronts in Fujian Province have launched a labor competition and learning upsurge in order to welcome the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. Wang Jincheng, a young worker at the Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory, converted a grinder into a grinder and milling machine, increasing production efficiency by 35 times; more than 10,000 rural youths in Chong'an County launched a high-efficiency movement centered on rice transplanting, and more than 2,200 youth red flag shock workers emerged in the Wuyi People's Commune.

The grassroots organizations of the League in various parts of the province, according to the requirements of the youth, adopted various forms such as speeches, League classes, League publications, and reading excellent works since the "May Fourth" Movement to carry out revolutionary tradition education and communist education for the broad masses of youth.

In the frontline troops in Fujian, fearless young gunners held commemorative meetings and report meetings next to the cannons, and expressed their determination to learn from the patriotic ideological qualities of heroic gunner Hu Dean and the good daughter of the Party, Xiang Xiuli. The artillery on the Xiamen front also held a get-together with support-the-front models "Ten Sisters", "Little Eighth Route Army", and "Twenty-Three Warriors". Young sailors in a certain military port spent the festival happily on the deck and on the dock. One hundred outstanding League members were rewarded by the leading organs of the frontline navy. At the frontline field airport, young air force soldiers held enthusiastic gatherings with the youth stationed there. The pilot Kuang Rumi, who shot down an enemy plane and won the third-class merit, also gave a wonderful flying performance for more than 1,000 youths. Many young soldiers wrote letters to their brother troops stationed in Tibet, congratulating them on the great victory of quickly putting down the rebellion and expressing their cordial greetings.

More than 2,000 youths of all ethnic groups in Hohhot City, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, held broadcast meetings and report meetings today to solemnly commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. At the meeting, youths of all ethnic groups resolutely opposed the unreasonable interference in our country's internal affairs by imperialists and Indian interventionists. Yan Su, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Gao Zenggui, secretary of the Hohhot Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the report meeting and broadcast meeting respectively, calling on youths of all ethnic groups to further strengthen national unity, consolidate the unification of the motherland, vigorously carry out the production increase and economy practice movement, and resolutely repel the conspiratorial activities of foreign interventionists.
