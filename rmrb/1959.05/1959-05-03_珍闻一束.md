    A Bunch of Curiosities
    The Highest City in the World
    The new city of Wenquan on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, located at the northern foot of the Tanggula Mountains at an altitude of 5,100 meters, is 400 meters higher than Pari in Tibet, which was previously recognized as the "highest city in the world." Five years ago, on the slopes where wild yaks and wild horses roamed, houses covering tens of thousands of square meters have now been built; the hot springs on the mountainside have been turned into comfortable bathhouses.
    A Thousand Kilometers of "Frozen Layer"
    In frigid zones, permanently frozen ground is called the "permafrost layer." The 1,030-kilometer stretch of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from the Kunlun Pass to Heihe in northern Tibet is a continuous permafrost layer. Here, a pickaxe is harder to use than on a sheet of iron. In the past, some people believed that highways could not be built on permafrost, but the Qinghai-Tibet Highway workers created a method to protect the permafrost, and this section of the road was built very well.
    "White Coal Mine"
    The Xidatan coal mine, mined by highway workers in the Kunlun Mountains, is more than 5,100 meters above sea level and is covered with snow all year round. People just dig through a thick layer of snow and dig out black coal. After a flurry of snow, the mine pit and the coal pile are once again pure white.

    珍闻一束
    世界最高的城市
    青藏公路上的新城——温泉，在拔海五千一百公尺的唐古拉山北麓，比过去公认为“世界高城”的西藏帕里还高四百公尺。五年前，野羊野马活动的山坡上，现在修起了上万平方公尺的房屋；半山腰的温泉被人们修成舒适的浴场。
    一千公里的“冰冻层”
    在严寒地带，地层永不解冻的，人们就叫它“永冻层”。青藏公路从昆仑山口到藏北黑河的一千零三十公里的地带，是绵延不断的永冻层。在这里，镐头刨下去，比刨在铁板上面还硬。过去有人认为永冻层上不能修公路，但青藏公路职工却创造了保护永冻层的办法，把这段路修得很好。
    “白色煤矿”
    公路职工在昆仑山上开采的西大滩煤矿，拔海五千一百多公尺，常年白雪皑皑，人们刚刨开厚厚一层积雪，挖出黑色的煤炭，一阵雪飘，矿坑里、煤堆上又是一片洁白。
