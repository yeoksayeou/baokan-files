Comrades of the Presidium and fellow representatives:

I have listened to Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report and the reports by the two Vice Premiers Li and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am very excited and fully support them. Only under the wise and great leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can such glorious achievements be made. In addition, I firmly support the central government's measures to quell the rebellion of the reactionary upper class in Tibet, as well as the central government's various policies regarding the Tibetan region. I resolutely oppose any collusion by reactionary forces at home and abroad to undermine the unity of the motherland and split national solidarity.

I am a returned overseas Chinese from Burma who returned to my hometown in Yunnan. This time, I was elected as a National People's Congress representative to participate in national affairs, and I feel very honored. I will devote all my energy to doing my job well to repay the honor and trust given to me by the Party and the people. Before this meeting, I inspected work in Baoshan, Mangshi, Tengchong and other places in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, where there are relatively large numbers of returned overseas Chinese and their families. I personally witnessed the leaping development of production and the joyful faces of the people in these overseas Chinese hometowns. The returned overseas Chinese and their families from Burma, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, India, France and other places that I contacted all expressed their gratitude to the Party committees and governments at all levels for their meticulous care for them. Now, I would like to report to the conference on what I have seen and heard in an overseas Chinese hometown—Heshun Township, Tengchong County, Yunnan Province:

Leaping Development of Agricultural and Sideline Production in Overseas Chinese Hometowns, People Smiling with Joy

Heshun Township has a total of 1,314 households with a population of 5,014, of which 1,060 households are overseas Chinese households, accounting for more than 80 percent. Almost every household in the township has relatives abroad, but the vast majority reside in Burma. In the era of reactionary rule, Heshun Township, like other parts of the country, had a very decadent social atmosphere. Many wealthy people were addicted to smoking and gambling, loafing around all day long, focusing on food and clothing. Therefore, although the land was fertile, only one season of rice was planted each year. Winter crops such as broad beans and wheat were never planted, and even vegetables relied on supplies from other townships. The landlord class occupied a large amount of land and controlled water conservancy without repairing it, saying that the Daying River has nine turns and eighteen bends, and it should be appreciated as scenery while letting floods run rampant. Therefore, there were often two years of poor harvests in three years, and annual grain production was only enough to eat for three months. The vast number of farmers in the township, faced with natural disasters, man-made calamities, and the Kuomintang's conscription of soldiers and grain, many left their homes and went abroad to live under the eaves of others and earn a living by enduring hardship. Many families relied on remittances sent back from abroad from selling their labor to survive. Without overseas remittances, starvation was commonplace, there was no way out, deaths occurred constantly, and life was not guaranteed.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Heshun Township carried out a series of social reforms, completely destroying the feudal system and the reactionary local bully forces. The working people were completely emancipated, and the social atmosphere underwent fundamental changes. Not only was the decadent atmosphere of the bourgeoisie eliminated, but they were also gradually educated to participate in labor and投入 into production. In recent years, with the strong help of the government in building water conservancy projects, improving farming techniques, and increasing the application of fertilizer, production throughout the township has increased year by year. The township has a total of 2,553 mu of paddy fields and 1,219 mu of dry land. The total output of rice in 1953 was 1.3 million jin, 1.4 million jin in 1954, 1.56 million jin in 1955, 1.86 million jin in 1956, and 2.04 million jin in 1957. Production increased year by year, and 1957 increased by 57 percent compared to 1953. From 1956, they began to learn to plant winter crops, and in that year, wheat alone yielded more than 30,000 jin. In 1957, they harvested 210,000 jin, and every household was allocated wheat to make pasta. Of course, judging from the production level in 1957, the average ration per person per year was only 410 jin, and the township still needed the state to supply a portion of grain. However, after the nationwide rectification campaign, Heshun Township, like other parts of the country, saw an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in 1958, and production greatly developed. The yield per mu increased from 765 jin in 1957 to 830 jin, and the average ration per person per year was 600 jin, in addition to a surplus of more than 770,000 jin of grain. It changed from a grain-deficient township to a grain-surplus township. For the first time in generations, many households changed from grain-buying households to grain-selling households. The attendance rate of overseas Chinese family members participating in production reached 100 percent. When I inspected Heshun Township, I saw that the winter wheat seedlings were growing green and lush, more than half a person tall. Many people said that not only had Heshun Township never grown such crops before, but they had never seen such good crops in their travels in the past. This year, they are completely confident of a bumper winter harvest.

In terms of developing sideline production, Heshun Township has also achieved good results. At present, there are 18 sideline industries, including sewing, embroidery, knitting, shoemaking, weaving, making straw mats, papermaking, weaving bamboo and rattan ware, rice milling, pig raising, and fish farming. A large number of elderly, weak, and women who are not familiar with agricultural labor have been arranged to participate in productive labor, which not only changed their past fear of labor, but also increased the income of each family. For example, Zhang Peifen, a member of an overseas Chinese family, earns 318 yuan a year from sewing. Liu Caiqin, a member of an overseas Chinese family, earns 21 yuan a month in the weaving group, which has greatly improved her life. He Lanfang's elderly mother and three children used to have very difficult lives and relied on government relief. Now, after she was arranged to work in the shoemaking workshop, she can earn about 20 yuan a month. In addition to maintaining the lives of the three people, she also has some savings. In 1957, Liu Yueqin's family earned 2,025 work points, receiving 1,530 jin of rice, 240 jin of wheat, 75 jin of soybeans, and 180 jin of potatoes. Each person in the family had an average of 510 jin of grain, and their lives were very good. In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, his family's income almost doubled.

Drinking Water, Thinking of the Source: Everyone Knows That Today's Development of Various Undertakings and the Happy Life Are Brought to Them by the Party and Chairman Mao

Last September, the Heshun Township People's Commune was established at the enthusiastic request of the masses. Due to the establishment of the People's Commune and the increase in grain production last year, they implemented free meals, providing the most important and reliable social insurance for everyone. We overseas Chinese wander around abroad, living under the eaves of others, all for food and clothing. Today, the motherland has solved this major issue, and meals are free. I think overseas Chinese must be very happy, very grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao, and very proud of the achievements and strength of the motherland. In addition, with the establishment of the commune, various public welfare undertakings have also been set up one after another. At present, there are 19 nurseries, one kindergarten, one comprehensive people's hospital, and 21 public canteens in the township. The establishment of these public welfare undertakings has liberated 1,092 housewives, allowing them to go to production service posts. This has not only greatly promoted production, but also freed them from the economic situation of relying on men for a living, increasing family income. After the establishment of the People's Commune, people's mental outlook has also undergone great changes. The cooperation and unity between people is closer than ever before.

With the development of production, the cultural and educational undertakings in Heshun Township have also developed significantly. The township currently has one primary school, one agricultural middle school, and is also trying to run a Yiqun Industrial Junior College. The schools all implement the policy of combining work and study. There are more than 300 children of overseas Chinese families and overseas Chinese students in Yiqun Middle School, and they all actively support combining work and study. When I went to Heshun Township, the students of the Industrial Junior College were interning in the county machinery factory. In addition, the township also has 14 broadcasting stations, a library and many sports fields. On the basis of the great development of cultural and educational undertakings, Heshun Township is also covered with poems and paintings on the walls. Poems and paintings praising the Party and Chairman Mao, praising the People's Commune and the Great Leap Forward are everywhere, and every sentence comes from the heart of everyone, fully expressing the sincere love of the overseas Chinese for the Party and Chairman Mao. Because they drink water, thinking of the source, everyone knows that today's happy life is brought to them by the Party and Chairman Mao.

Finally, I must mention that when I went to Heshun Township, the overseas Chinese families told me that the overseas remittances received this year increased by about 8 percent compared to the same period last year. The bank has also made many improvements in service procedures to facilitate overseas Chinese families, such as delivering the money directly to their door. In the People's Commune, those who have overseas remittances or other savings live a better life, and no one interferes or raises objections. There are also some overseas Chinese families who, under the principle of full awareness and voluntariness, have opened iron factories, wood factories, and coal and brick factories in accordance with the state's preferential policies for overseas remittances investing in industry. Recently, overseas Chinese families have also raised funds to build a 30-kilowatt hydropower station, which is scheduled to transmit electricity at the end of April. The overseas Chinese families said that these policies make people feel more and more that the Party and the People's Government care for overseas Chinese. Therefore, many people asked me to express their deep gratitude to our Party and our respected leader Chairman Mao when I come to Beijing for the meeting this time! Please allow me to take this opportunity to express my highest and most grateful respect to the Party and Chairman Mao on behalf of them.

Learn from the Advanced Rural Areas and Overseas Chinese Hometowns of the Motherland, and Build Socialism Together

Fellow representatives, the changes in Heshun Township, an overseas Chinese hometown, are one ten-thousandth of the changes in our motherland. The situation in Baoshan, Mangshi and other places is the same as that in Heshun, and it is completely different from before liberation. I will not go into details. Although they have achieved these great achievements, they are not satisfied with this now. Under the leadership of the local Party committee, they are uniting as one and moving forward with greater and more determined steps to learn from the advanced rural areas and overseas Chinese hometowns of the motherland. Everyone there has a heroic oath that they must muster soaring enthusiasm and use a greater, better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, welcome their relatives abroad, and return to the motherland this year to celebrate the National Day of our great motherland with them.

During my inspection, due to my old age and limited time, although I did not see much, there were new things everywhere that were overwhelming. In contrast to the old and new, I was reminded of the more than 40 years I spent abroad before liberation. Due to the rule of the reactionaries, the motherland suffered尽帝国主义的欺侮和压榨, and we overseas Chinese were hitting walls and suffering everywhere abroad. The imperialists were even arrogant enough not to treat us overseas Chinese as human beings. Compared with today's situation, it is really a world apart. I really don't know what words I should use here to represent our tens of millions of overseas Chinese to thank the Party and Chairman Mao. Please allow me to express here to the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country that we overseas Chinese must unite around the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, tirelessly serve socialist construction and contribute our strength to the strong socialist motherland. Finally, let us cheer:

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the beloved great leader Chairman Mao!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

### 归侨和侨眷感谢党和毛主席  梁金山代表的发言

专栏：

    归侨和侨眷感谢党和毛主席
    梁金山代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我听了周总理的政府工作报告和两位李副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，非常兴奋，并完全拥护。只有英明伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，才能取得这样光辉的成就。此外，我坚决拥护中央平定西藏上层反动集团叛乱的措施，以及中央关于西藏地方的各项政策。坚决反对任何国内外反动派破坏祖国统一，分裂民族团结的勾当。
    我是由缅甸回到云南故乡的华侨，这次被选为全国人民代表，参与国家大事，感到非常的光荣。我一定要尽所有精力做好工作，来报答党和人民给我的光荣和信任。这次会前我曾在云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州的归侨及侨眷比较多的保山、芒市、腾冲等地视察工作，我亲眼看到了这些侨乡的生产飞跃发展和人民喜笑颜开的情况，我接触过的缅甸、新加坡、马来亚、泰国、印度、法国等地的归侨和侨眷，他们都感谢各级党委和政府对他们无微不至的关怀。现在，我仅就一个侨乡——云南腾冲县和顺乡的所见所闻向大会作个汇报：
    侨乡农副业生产飞跃发展，人民喜笑颜开
    和顺乡共有一千三百一十四户，人口五千零一十四人，其中侨户一千零六十户，占百分之八十以上。几乎全乡家家户户都有亲友在国外，但绝大多数侨居缅甸。在反动统治的年代，和顺乡和全国各地一样，社会风气很颓丧，生活富裕的人不少沉沦在烟、赌之中，终日游手好闲，讲吃讲穿，因此土地虽然肥沃，但是一年只种一季大春，蚕豆、小麦等小春从来不种，甚至连蔬菜也靠外乡供应。地主阶级霸占了大量土地，把持水利不修，说什么大盈江九转十八湾，要作风景欣赏而任随洪水泛滥，因此常常三年两不收，每年生产粮食只够三个月吃。该乡广大农民，天灾人祸加之国民党征兵征粮的逼迫，许多人离乡背井，到国外去寄人篱下受气谋生，许多人的家庭靠国外卖劳力的收入汇回来维持。无侨汇时，挨饿是常事，走投无路，死亡不断发生，生活毫无保证。
    解放后，和顺乡在党的领导下进行了一系列的社会改革，彻底摧毁了封建制度和反动的地霸势力，劳动人民得到了大翻身，社会风气起了根本的变化。不仅消灭了资产阶级的腐朽风气，而且逐渐地教育了他们参加了劳动，投入到生产中去。几年来在政府大力帮助兴修水利、改进耕作技术、增施肥料等等情况下，全乡生产年年上升。该乡共有水田二千五百五十三亩，旱地一千二百一十九亩，一九五三年稻谷总产量为一百三十万斤，一九五四年为一百四十万斤，一九五五年为一百五十六万斤，一九五六年为一百八十六万斤，一九五七年为二百零四万斤。生产逐年增加，一九五七年比一九五三年增产百分之五十七。一九五六年起开始学种小春，当年仅小麦就收三万余斤，一九五七年则收到二十一万斤，家家户户都分到麦子做面食。当然从一九五七年的生产水平看，每人每年平均口粮只有四百一十斤，全乡仍需要由国家供应一部分粮食。但是经过全民整风后，和顺乡也和全国各地一样，在一九五八年出现了空前未有的大跃进，生产大大的发展了，亩产由一九五七年的七百六十五斤增加为八百三十斤，每人每年平均口粮分得六百斤，以外还有余粮七十七万余斤。由缺粮乡变成了余粮乡，许多户人家祖祖辈辈以来第一次由买粮户变为卖粮户。侨眷参加生产的出工率达到了百分之一百。我在和顺乡视察时，见他们的小春麦苗长得绿油油的，有半人多高，许多人说不但和顺乡从来没有长过这种庄稼，就是他们过去奔走四方也没有看见过这样好的庄稼。今年他们小春的大丰收那是完全有把握的了。
    发展副业生产方面，和顺乡同样取得了很好的成绩，目前已办有缝纫、刺绣、针织、制鞋、织布、打草席、造纸、编制竹藤器、碾米加工、养猪、养鱼等十八项副业。安排了大批的老弱及不熟悉农业劳动的妇女参加生产劳动，不仅改变了他们过去怕劳动的情况，还增加了每家人的收入。如侨眷张佩芬参加缝纫，全年收入三百一十八元，侨眷刘采芹在织布组，每月可收入二十一元，使生活有了很大改善。侨眷何兰芳的老母和小孩三人，过去生活十分困难，依靠政府救济，现在安排了她在制鞋车间后，她每月可收入二十元左右，除维持三人生活外，还有一些存款了。侨眷刘月芹家一九五七年得工分二千零二十五分，分得谷子一千五百三十斤，麦子二百四十斤，黄豆七十五斤，洋芋一百八十斤，全家每人平均有粮食五百一十斤，生活过得很好，一九五八年大跃进，给他家的收入几乎又增加了一倍。
    饮水思源，每个人都晓得今天各种事业的发展和过着幸福生活，是党和毛主席给他们带来的
    去年九月，和顺乡人民公社在群众热烈要求下成立了。由于人民公社的建立，由于去年粮食的增产，他们实行了吃饭不要钱，使每一个人得到了最重要最可靠的社会保险。我们华侨在国外居人篱下奔波四方，无非为衣为食，今天祖国解决了这件大事，吃饭不要钱了。我想海外侨胞不知道是多么高兴，多么感激党和毛主席，多么为祖国的成就和强大而自豪。此外，随着公社的建立，各种公益事业也相继办起来了。目前全乡有托儿所十九个，幼儿园一个，综合人民医院一所，公共食堂二十一处。这些公益事业的成立，解放了家庭妇女一千零九十二人，使她们走向生产服务岗位，不但大大地推动了生产，而且使她们摆脱了依靠男人生活的经济情况，增加了家庭收入。人民公社建立后，人们的精神面貌也有了很大的改变，人与人之间的合作团结，比任何时候都更加亲密了。
    随着生产的发展，和顺乡的文教事业也有了显著的发展。该乡目前有小学一所，农业中学一所，并且还试办了一所益群工业专科学校。学校都贯彻了勤工俭学的方针。益群中学中有三百多名侨眷子弟和侨生，他们都积极拥护勤工俭学。我到和顺乡时，工业专科的学生，正在县城机械厂内实习。此外，该乡还有广播站十四处，有一个图书馆和许多体育场。在文教事业大发展的基础上，和顺乡也是诗歌图画满墙壁。歌颂党和毛主席，歌颂人民公社和大跃进的诗画处处都是，句句出自每个人的内心、充分表达了侨胞对党和毛主席真心实意的爱戴。因为他们饮水思源，每个人都晓得今天的幸福生活，是党和毛主席给他们带来的。
    最后不能不提到的，我去和顺乡时，侨眷们告诉我，今年汇来的侨汇比去年同期增加了百分之八左右。银行在服务手续方面也有了许多便利侨眷的改进，例如把款子直接送上门等。在人民公社中，有侨汇或有其他存款的人，他们的生活更好一些，也没有任何人干涉或受到异议。也有一些侨眷，在充分自觉自愿的原则下，按照国家优待侨汇投资工业的办法，开办了铁工厂、木工厂、石炭砖瓦厂等等。最近侨眷又集资兴建了一个发电量三十瓩的水电站，准备四月底输电。侨眷们说，这些政策益加使人感到党和人民政府对华侨的关怀。因此，许多人表示要我这一次来北京开会时，代表他们向我们的党和敬爱的领袖毛主席，表示深深的感激！请允许我借此在这里代表他们向党和毛主席致以最崇高、最感激的敬礼。
      向祖国先进农村和侨乡看齐，
            共同建设社会主义
    各位代表，侨乡和顺乡的变化是我们祖国变化的千万分之一。保山、芒市等地的情况也和和顺一样，和解放前形成天壤之别，我不再赘述了。虽然他们取得了这些巨大成绩，但是，他们现在并不以此为满足，他们正在当地党委领导下，团结一致，以更大更坚决的步伐向先进的祖国农村和侨乡看齐，他们那里每一个人都有英雄的誓言，一定要鼓足冲天干劲，以更大更好更全面的大跃进来迎接祖国国庆十周年，欢迎他们在国外的亲人，在今年国庆节时回到祖国来和他们一道欢度伟大祖国今年的国庆。
    我视察中因年老和时间所限，虽然所见不多，但到处是应接不暇的新事物。在新旧对比之下，使我想起了解放前我在国外渡过的四十余年，由于反动派的统治，祖国受尽帝国主义的欺侮和压榨，我们在国外的华侨则是到处碰壁，到处受气，帝国主义甚至骄横到不把我们华侨当人看待，比之今日的情况，真是不可同日而语，我真不知道我在这里应该用什么话来代表我们几千万华侨来感激党和毛主席才好。请让我在这里向党向毛主席和向全国人民表示，我们华侨一定要团结在党和毛主席的周围，在党和毛主席的领导下，不懈地为社会主义建设服务，把我们的力量贡献给强大的社会主义祖国。最后让我们欢呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
