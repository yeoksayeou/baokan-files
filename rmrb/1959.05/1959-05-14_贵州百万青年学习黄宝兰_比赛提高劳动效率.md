Guizhou, May 13th (By our own correspondent) - Approximately one million young men and women in rural Guizhou have engaged in a competition to learn from Huang Baolan (an expert rice transplanter and provincial agricultural labor model) and improve rice transplanting efficiency.

The news that Huang Baolan, a female commune member from Jiangkou Commune in Tongren County, Guizhou Province, transplanted 97,000 seedlings in one day using a rice transplanter, spread throughout the province at the end of April, stirring the hearts of many young men and women. Young women in Xiuwen County excitedly discussed the matter, saying, "If Huang Baolan can do it, so can we!" 15,000 women in the county have resolved to "Learn from Baolan, Catch up with Baolan, and Surpass Baolan." More than 1,200 young men and women from the Guantian Management District of the Shatu Commune in Jinsha County, upon seeing the newspaper report of Huang Baolan's new transplanting record, immediately gathered in the fields and began enthusiastically studying. After three days of diligent learning and practice, 750 young men and women learned how to use the rice transplanter. Wang Changhua, a famous female rice transplanter from the Masang Management District of Fengyi Commune in Zheng'an County, was shocked to discover that Huang Baolan had far surpassed her and told people, "There's always someone stronger." She is determined to catch up.

In the movement to learn from Huang Baolan, young men and women in various places are putting in extra effort and using more ingenuity. They are actively improving rice transplanting techniques, steadily increasing transplanting efficiency. Liu Shifen, a 19-year-old Communist Youth League member from Tangtou Commune in Sinan County, recently emerged as a star, transplanting 157,600 seedlings in one day. When she first started using the rice transplanter, she was neither fast nor good, but she learned and researched tenaciously, quickly discovering that the transplanter's baffle was too loose and the seedling clips were too heavy. She immediately improved them, increasing work efficiency by more than double. Tao Mingguang, a commune member from Yaxi Commune in the suburbs of Zunyi City, made innovating tools his first step in the movement to learn from Huang Baolan. After improving the rice transplanter to eliminate the problem of dragging seedlings and water, his transplanting efficiency increased sevenfold compared to before.

In this competition movement, Party organizations in various places have strengthened political and ideological education and have also paid attention to commending newly emerged technical pacesetters. After discovering that Xu Renxiang, a 19-year-old girl from Suiyang Commune, had achieved the highest county record of 140,000 seedlings transplanted in one day, the Meitan County Committee of the Communist Party of China quickly launched a "Learn from Baolan, Catch up with Renxiang" transplanting competition throughout the county. A few days later, Huang Mingxia, a female commune member from Fenggang Commune, caught up with Xu Renxiang, and on the third day of Huang Mingxia catching up with Xu Renxiang, she was surpassed by Shang Shiying, a transplanting expert from her own team. In this way, this year's rice transplanting is progressing both quickly and well.

Currently, more than 100,000 people across Guizhou Province are approaching Huang Baolan's record of transplanting 2.7 mu per day, and a small number of people have already surpassed Huang Baolan.

With the vigorous development of the transplanting competition movement, attendance rates and labor efficiency are constantly improving in various communes, and the progress of transplanting has greatly accelerated. The transplanting workers of Yongxing Commune in Meitan County have increased their labor efficiency from 0.4 mu to 1.5 mu per day, completing transplanting tasks for more than 10,000 mu of rice more than 20 days ahead of the same period last year. The shortage of transplanting labor that originally appeared in many places has also been alleviated.

    贵州百万青年学习黄宝兰
    比赛提高劳动效率
    本报贵阳13日电  贵州各地农村约有百万男女青年，投入了学习黄宝兰（插秧能手，贵州省农业劳动模范），提高插秧劳动效率的竞赛运动。
    贵州铜仁县江口公社女社员黄宝兰使用插秧机一日插秧九万七千窝的消息，于4月底传遍全省后，激动了广大青年男女的心。修文县的青年妇女，激动地议论这件事。她们说：黄宝兰能做到，我们也能做到。这个县已有一万五千名妇女决心“学宝兰、赶宝兰、超宝兰”。金沙县沙土公社官田管理区的一千二百多名青年男女，看到登有黄宝兰插秧新纪录的报纸时，立即围坐田间，展开热烈学习。他们经过三天的苦学苦钻，有七百五十个青年男女学会了使用插秧机。正安县凤仪公社马桑管理区著名女插秧手王昌华，发现黄宝兰已远远超过了自己，大吃一惊，对人说：真是强中有强。她决心赶上去。
    各地青年男女在学习黄宝兰的运动中，都是劲上加劲，巧上加巧。他们积极改进插秧技术，使插秧效率步步提高。最近出现的一天插秧十五万七千六百多窝的姑娘——思南县塘头公社十九岁的共青团员刘世芬，开始使用插秧机时，插得不快也不好，但她顽强地学习和钻研，很快地发现了插秧机档板太松、秧夹过重的缺点，立即加以改进，工效比原来提高一倍以上。遵义市郊鸭溪公社社员陶明光，他在学黄宝兰的运动中，第一条措施就是革新工具。插秧机拖秧带水的毛病经过改进后，他的插秧效率比以前提高七倍。
    在这项竞赛运动中，各地党组织都加强了政治思想教育工作，并且注意表扬新出现的技术标兵。中共湄潭县委会，在绥阳公社发现十九岁的姑娘徐仁香，一日插秧十四万窝的全县最高纪录后，迅速向全县发起开展
  “学宝兰、赶仁香”的插秧竞赛运动。几天后，凤冈公社的女社员黄明霞，就赶上了徐仁香，而黄明霞在赶上徐仁香的第三天，又被本队的插秧能手尚士英超过了。就这样，今年的水稻插秧进行得既快又好。
    目前贵州全省已有十多万人接近黄宝兰日插二亩七分的纪录，并有一小部分人已超过了黄宝兰。
    各公社随着插秧竞赛运动的热烈开展，出勤率和劳动效率不断提高，插秧进度大大加快。湄潭县永兴公社的插秧手们，劳动效率都由开初的日插四分提高到日插一亩五分，从而一万多亩水稻比去年同期提前二十多天完成插秧任务。许多地方原来出现的插秧劳力不足情况，也得到了缓和。
