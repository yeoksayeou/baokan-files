Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 24th: The second phase of the Wuhan Railway Hub project has recently begun construction. Currently, workers are rushing to expand the Xinjiang'an marshalling station, increasing the number of tracks from eighteen to thirty-eight, and building a hump yard to expand vehicle transport capacity.

The Wuhan Railway Hub project stretches from Danshuichi in the north to Dahuangling in the south, from Heliu Station in the east to Xindun in the west, spanning the three towns of Wuhan. Its main projects are the two large-scale modern marshalling stations at Xinjiang'an in Hankou and Yujiawan in Wuchang. Once these projects are completed, the traffic capacity of the Beijing-Guangzhou double-track railway can be increased by more than threefold.

The Wuhan Railway Hub project was designed by the Fourth Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways. The first phase of the project began construction in May 1957 and was completed in September last year.

    新华社武汉24日电　武汉铁路枢纽第二期工程已在最近动工建设。目前，工人们正在突击扩建新江岸编组站，把这个编组站的股道由十八条增加到三十八条，并修建驼峰调车场，以扩大车辆运转能力。
    武汉铁路枢纽工程北起丹水池、南至大花岭、东起何刘站、西达新墩，跨越武汉三镇。它的主体工程是汉口新江岸和武昌余家湾两个大型现代化编组站，这些工程完成以后，可以使京广复线的通车能力增加三倍以上。
