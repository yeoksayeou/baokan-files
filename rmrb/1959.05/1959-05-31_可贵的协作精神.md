A commendable Spirit of Collaboration
    Liu Hancheng
    I was deeply moved when I read in the newspaper about the large number of combine harvesters and grain threshers that were drawn from Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces and transported to Henan, Hebei, Anhui and other provinces to support the summer harvest.

    One is in the northeast of the motherland, and the other is in the Central Plains of the motherland. However, at the tense moment when the state-owned farms and people's communes in Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces were "burning wheat and exploding beans" in the Central Plains, rushing to harvest wheat, they drew a large number of combine harvesters and grain threshers and sent them thousands of miles to Henan, Hebei, Anhui and other provinces with large wheat-growing areas to assist in the wheat harvest. Moreover, Heilongjiang Province, while drawing machines, also assigned two skilled operators to each machine to be responsible for the installation, driving, and repair of the machines.

    Over the past year, this spirit of communist collaboration has been blowing across the country like a spring breeze: steel plants support each other, machine manufacturing plants also support each other, hospitals collaborate with hospitals, and film studios also collaborate with film studios... The scope of mutual assistance and collaboration ranges from experience and technology to material and human resources, covering all aspects.

    This spirit of communist collaboration, with the whole country as one chess game, is the brilliance of the General Line and the brilliance of the Party's policies. This brilliance will forever illuminate us and will become even more widespread.

    This spirit of collaboration is infinitely inspiring. I will write a quatrain to express my praise:

        The Central Plains wheat harvest is as urgent as fire,
        Machines are sent from the faraway border regions,
        The whole country collaborates as one chess game,
        People from all over the country are like brothers.

    可贵的协作精神
    刘汉城
    在报纸上读到关于黑龙江、辽宁两省抽调大批联合收割机和谷物脱粒机，运往河南、河北、安徽等省支援夏收的报道，很受感动。
    一在祖国的东北，一在祖国的中原地区，然而，黑龙江和辽宁两省的国营农场、人民公社，在中原地区“焦麦炸豆”、麦季抢收如火燃眉的紧张时刻，抽调大批的联合收割机、谷物脱粒机，千里迢迢，送到麦播面积较大的河南、河北、安徽等省协助麦收。并且，黑龙江省在抽调机器的同时，每部机器还调配了两名熟练的操作人员，负责机器的安装、驾驶、检修。
    一年来，这种共产主义的协作精神，正像春风一样的吹遍全国：钢铁厂互相支援，机器制造厂也相互支援，医院和医院协作，电影制片厂和电影制片厂也协作……。互助协作的范围，从经验技术，到物力人力，面面俱到。
    这种全国一盘棋的共产主义大协作精神，正是总路线的光辉，是党的政策的光辉。这光辉将永远照耀着我们，并且，将会更加广大。
    这种协作精神，令人无限感奋。口占一绝，以表赞美：
        中原麦收如火急，
        塞外迢迢送机器，
        全国协作棋一盘，
        天南地北如兄弟。
