　　Guangzhou Bulb Factory Starts from Scratch
    Originally Scheduled to be Built in Two and a Half Years, Now Goes into Production in Four Months Using Indigenous Methods
    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, May 8) The Guangzhou Bulb Factory, located in the southern suburbs of Guangzhou, is a factory that "started from scratch."

    The Guangzhou Bulb Factory is a capital construction project above the state quota, originally scheduled to be built in two and a half years. Now, after the factory adopted indigenous methods, it only took four months from October last year to before the Spring Festival this year for the bulb and mercury lamp workshops to begin production.

    The six factory buildings that have already been built did not use any steel bars and only used two tons of cement. The timber used was mostly short and old materials. The employee dormitories are rented vacant civilian houses from the local people's commune. The office space for functional departments is built with bamboo poles, palm leaves, and tarpaulins. Currently, although this factory looks simple, it undertakes the production task of 1.2 million bulbs and 5,000 mercury lamps annually.

    According to the design plan, the Guangzhou Bulb Factory was supposed to be a fully automated modern factory with an annual output of 36 million bulbs, 200,000 fluorescent tubes, and 10,000 mercury lamps. Since the Great Leap Forward, in order to give way to the overall situation, the factory's large-scale capital construction projects were halted. In order to implement the spirit of both giving way and leaping forward, the factory decided to follow the path of moving from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, and using the method of being poor but striving skillfully to build the factory through self-reliance. In solving the equipment problem, the workers displayed a spirit of fearlessness. For example, the factory building in the glass workshop needed to build a chimney, but there were no materials, so they found gasoline drums to replace it. There was no blacksmith, so they asked a blacksmith from the local people's commune to come. Without machines, they borrowed a set of bulb machines that had been abandoned for many years from Foshan City. This set of machines was already incomplete. In order to revive it, five technicians in the metalworking workshop worked hard day and night with more than a dozen apprentices. The workshop lacked tools and equipment, and raw materials were also scarce, so they collected waste tools and old materials everywhere and utilized them after processing. After more than 20 days of hard work, the discarded machine was revived, and the bulb workshop was equipped. Later, fraternal units supported them with some scattered equipment, and they used these waste materials to make equipment for producing mercury.

    Currently, the preparatory office of this factory is constantly expanding the factory's production capacity while producing and building at the same time. According to the design drawings issued by the higher authorities, they are starting to manufacture a set of automated bulb-making equipment with an annual output of 5 million bulbs. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the factory's production capacity will increase to half of the original design capacity.

### 广州灯泡厂白手起家  原定两年半建成现在土法上马四个月就开始了生产

　　广州灯泡厂白手起家
    原定两年半建成现在土法上马四个月就开始了生产
    本报广州8日电　位于广州市南郊的广州灯泡厂，是一个“白手起家”的工厂。
    广州灯泡厂是国家限额以上的一个基建项目，原定用两年半时间建成；现在，这个厂采用土法上马以后，从去年10月到今年春节前，只花了四个月的时间，灯泡和水银灯车间已开始投入生产。
    这个厂已经建成的六座厂房，没有用钢筋，只用了两吨水泥，用的木材也多是一些短材旧料。职工宿舍是向当地人民公社租借的闲置民房。职能部门的办公场所，是用竹竿、葵叶和油毛毡搭盖起来的。目前，这个工厂，外表虽然简陋，但是，它却担负着年产一百二十万个灯泡和五千盏水银灯的生产任务。
    广州灯泡厂按照设计方案，是个年产三千六百万只灯泡、二十万支日光管、一万盏水银灯完全自动化的现代大厂，大跃进以来，为了停车让路，这个厂大规模的基建工程是停了。这个厂为了贯彻既让路又跃进的精神，便决定走由土到洋、由小到大的道路，用穷干巧干的办法，自力更生，把工厂办起来。在解决设备问题上，工人们发扬了无畏的精神，如玻璃车间的厂房要建烟囱，没有材料，就找了汽油桶来代替，没有铁匠，又通过当地人民公社请来了一个铁匠。没有机器，他们从佛山市借来一部废弃多年的灯泡机一套。这套机器已经残缺不全。为了使它复活，金工车间五个技工带着十多个学徒，日夜苦战，车间里欠缺工具设备，原材料也缺，他们便到处收集废旧工具和旧料，经过处理后加以利用。经过二十多天苦战，那套废机器复活了，灯泡车间也装备起来了。后来兄弟单位支援他们一些零星器材，就利用这些废旧材料制成了生产水银的设备。
    目前，这个厂的筹建处正在边生产边建设的情况下，不断扩大本厂的生产能力。他们根据上级发下来的设计图纸，在着手制造一套年产灯泡五百万只的自动化制灯泡设备。预计到今年底，这个厂的生产能力将增长到原设计能力的一半。
