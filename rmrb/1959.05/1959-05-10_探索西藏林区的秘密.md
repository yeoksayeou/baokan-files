　　Exploring the Secrets of the Tibetan Forest Area
　　Forest Investigator Li Junsheng
    Tibet has abundant forest resources and is one of China's major forest bases. But what is the distribution of the forests here? How should they be developed and utilized? We didn't know any of this in the past. Therefore, several of us forest surveyors accepted the task of forest exploration. Under the leadership of the local Party committee in Tibet and with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people, we surveyed the main forest areas of Bomi, Tagong, and Yadong on the southern slopes of the Himalayas over a period of nearly ten months.

    Zhamu is the central city of Bomi Linba. We advanced along the Palong Zangbu River, which lies in the center of Bomi Linba, with the Kangzang Highway winding through a sea of green. Evergreen forests densely cover the river valleys and mountain peaks, with straight pine trees and alpine oaks standing tall, forming a natural canopy over the highway. Soon, we entered the Qingduo Zangbu River valley, left the Kangzang Highway, and continued along a narrow mountain path along the foothills.

    The river gradually narrowed, and the mountains became steeper. Mount Mongla was ahead. Mount Mongla is a high mountain with an altitude of five thousand meters, and its summit is covered with snow all year round. Few people have ever been to the top. The climate on the summit is particularly cold, and forests cannot grow beyond a certain altitude. The night before climbing the mountain, we camped at the boundary between the forest and barren mountains at an altitude of four thousand meters. The reason we camped here was that the weather on the Tibetan Plateau often changes in the afternoon. If we didn't cross the summit before noon, we might encounter blizzards or hail. At the same time, if we went further, we wouldn't find water or firewood and wouldn't be able to camp. It was mid-July, the height of summer. If we were inland, we would be sweating even if we fanned ourselves constantly, but here at night, even wearing cotton clothes, we couldn't stop shivering.

    As usual, we had a meeting in the evening to discuss and finalize the exploration data everyone had obtained during the day. The mountain wind was strong, and we couldn't light candles, so we had to hold the meeting around the raging bonfire outside the tent, discussing and organizing the records by the firelight.

    We set off again before dawn the next day. The snow on the snow peaks was very thick, and the surface layer was very slippery. In addition to relying on wooden sticks to support our bodies, we sometimes had to crawl on the ground with both hands. Even so, we often slipped down the slopes.

    After this climb, we thoroughly clarified the forest growth limit: forests cannot grow above an altitude of four thousand two hundred meters, so there are only barren mountains and grasslands; between four thousand two hundred meters and four thousand meters, there are scattered fir trees, cypresses, and the most numerous alpine willows, rhododendrons, and other small shrubs. Before this, we could not find any information about the forest growth limit in all the forestry books we had consulted. On the mountain, we also collected many known and unknown plant specimens to bring back for scientific research.

    In addition to the dense pine, spruce, and fir trees, the Yarlung Zangbo River basin also has a particularly large variety of wild fruits. There are honey-sweet large peaches, sweet and sour small cherries, oil-rich walnuts...etc. Because there is no cultivation or management, they grow and fall naturally. When we arrived here, it was the season for the fruits to ripen. The red and yellow fruits bent the branches, and the ripe fruits fell straight down; when a gust of wind came, it was like hail falling. The rugged path was covered with fruits, and from a distance, it looked like a road surface paved with red and yellow pebbles. We had a good meal, and then had to walk gently over the fruits with regret. Here, we selected representative forest lands for standard land surveys.

    September in the plateau is the rainy season in the Yarlung Zangbo River, with continuous drizzle all day long. One night there was a downpour, the river rose sharply, and the pontoon bridge over the Baka Gully was washed away. In order to save time and start the exploration of the Yadong forest area as soon as possible, we decided to cross the rapids of the Baka Gully. Although the Baka Gully is not wide, the water flow is very rapid, and the rolling torrent is mixed with many large rocks. While crossing, a horse carrying luggage was washed down by the water, and the luggage was swept away by the raging torrent. We chased after it on horseback for a long distance but couldn't catch up. At this critical moment, a Tibetan villager named Dorje Le came from the opposite bank. When he saw the things being washed away, he jumped into the rapids on horseback without hesitation and chased for more than three miles before finally retrieving all the luggage for us. Sina Wangjiu, a member of the Baka Village Committee (who worked in the preparatory committee of the Tagong Jiquo-level office), also rushed to the riverbank after hearing about this and personally led us across the water. This brotherly spirit of national unity deeply moved us and will never be forgotten.

    Through this exploration, we have initially grasped the forest distribution of several major forest areas on the Tibetan Plateau, learned about the forest tree species, forest area, and forest stock volume, and drawn forest distribution maps based on these data. From then on, the distribution of several major forest areas in Tibet can be seen on China's forest distribution map.

### 探索西藏林区的秘密

　　探索西藏林区的秘密
　　森林调查员　李俊升
    西藏有着丰富的森林资源，是我国主要的森林基地之一。但是这里的森林分布情况究竟怎样？应当如何开发利用？所有这些，我们过去都不知道。因此，我们几个森林调查人员接受了森林勘查的任务。我们在西藏地方党的领导下，在人民解放军和藏族人民的支持帮助下，在前后将近十个月的过程中，勘查了波密、塔工和喜马拉雅山南麓的亚东等几个主要林区。
    扎木是波密林巴的中心城市，我们沿着横卧在波密林巴中心的泊龙藏布江前进，康藏公路蜿蜒曲折浸浴在绿色海洋中。四季常青的森林密布河谷山巅，笔直的松树和高山栎，高高耸立，给公路上空搭成了天然的荫棚。不久，进入了倾多藏布河谷，离开了康藏公路，又沿着山麓的羊肠小道前进。
    河流渐渐狭窄了，山势也越来越陡。蒙格拉山就在前面。蒙格拉山是座海拔五千公尺的高山，顶峰上终年复盖着积雪，很少有人上去过。山顶上的气候特别寒冷，森林生长到一定的高度就不能再往上长了。在爬山的前一天晚上，我们曾在海拔四千公尺的森林和荒山交界的地方宿营。我们所以要在这里宿营，是因为西藏高原上的天气往往在下午发生变化，如果不在中午以前翻过山顶，说不定会遇上暴风雪或冰雹；同时再往前走，就找不到水源和柴禾，也无法宿营。当时正是7月中旬的盛夏季节，如果在内地，即使不停地摇着扇子，也得流汗，但是这里夜晚，身上穿着棉衣，还是不住的打哆嗦。
    晚上我们照例要开个碰头会，把白天大家得到的勘查资料讨论决定下来。山风很大，想点腊烛也点不着，我们只好围着帐篷外面熊熊的火堆来开会，就着火光边讨论边整理记录。
    第二天天还未亮又出发了。雪峰上的积雪很厚，表面的一层又很滑，我们除了依靠木棍支撑着身体以外，有时还需要两手在地上爬行。就这样，还经常从坡上滑下来。
    经过这一次爬山，我们彻底弄清了森林生长界限：在海拔四千二百公尺以上森林就不能生长了，因此只有荒山草地；四千二百公尺以下到四千公尺之间，生长着零星的冷杉、柏树和数量最多的高山柳、杜鹃等矮小的灌木林。而在这以前，我们在接触到的所有林业书籍中是找不到森林生长界限资料的。在山上我们还采集了许多知名和不知名的植物标本，带回来供作科学研究资料。
    雅鲁藏布江流域除了生长着茂密的松树、云杉、冷杉，野果的种类也特别繁多。那里有蜜甜的大桃子、酸甜的小樱桃、油脂丰富的核桃……等等，因为无人培育管理，都是自生自落。我们来到这里的时候，正是水果成熟的季节，红黄的果子压弯了树枝，熟透了的果子直往下落；来了一阵风就简直像下冰雹似地撒了下来。崎岖的小路上落满了果子，远看像是用红黄色的石子砌成的路面。我们饱尝了一顿，又不得不怀着惋惜的心情轻轻地从果子上走过去。在这里，我们选择有代表性的林地，进行了标准地调查。
    高原的9月，是雅鲁藏布江的雨季，整天细雨连绵。一天夜里下了一场倾盆大雨，河水暴涨，八卡沟上的便桥也被冲垮了。我们为了争取时间，及早开始亚东林区的勘查工作，决定从八卡沟的急流中渡过去。八卡沟虽然不宽，但是水流十分湍急，浪花翻滚的洪流中夹着许多大石块。在过渡时，有一匹驮行李的马被水冲倒了，行李被汹涌的急流卷走，我们骑马追了很远也没有追上。在这千钧一发的时候，对岸来了一位叫多杰勒的藏族老乡。他看到东西被水冲跑了，就奋不顾身地骑马跳下急流中，追了三里多远终于把行李替我们全部打捞上来。八卡屯的委员思那王久（在塔工基巧级办事处筹委会工作）听到了这件事，也急忙赶到河边，亲自踏着水给我们带路。这样兄弟般的民族友爱精神，深深地感动了我们，使我们永远不能忘记。
    经过这次勘查，我们初步掌握了西藏高原的几个主要林区森林分布情况，知道了森林树种、森林面积和森林蓄积量，并且根据这些资料绘制了森林分布图。从此，在我国森林分布图上，可以看出西藏几个主要林区的分布情况了。
