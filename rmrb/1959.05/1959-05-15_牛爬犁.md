    Ox Sled

    A docile water buffalo pulls a sled, the sled loaded with lake grass, an old man riding on the buffalo's back, a smile on his lips. The ox sled moves slowly, a long dragon on the dike, young people walking behind, singing out:
  "Our home is on Dongting Lake, white clouds floating over Mount Junshan; you fish and I farm, you pick tea and I pick peaches.
  "You herd cattle and I feed fine horses, you drive carts and I build bridges; let's work together to build our home, happy and carefree in the commune!" The young people sing beautifully, the old man waves his hands and feet; he clears his throat on the buffalo's back, and sings a little tune in a loud voice:
  "White beard stroked by hand, old Huang Zhong refuses to admit he's old! Getting up early and walking by the lake, bringing a steel knife.
  "Slash, slash, the white light flashes, a wave of the hand and a pile of green grass. Quick hands and feet make people happy, restoring youthful vigor!
  "Today's grass cutting is like ten days of work in the past. For the country and for future generations, hurriedly transporting back fertilizer!" Ox horns curve on the dike, the ox sled follows the ox, the horns hung with the sunset glow, the crescent moon climbing the willow branches. The old man sings with gusto, the young people shout in unison,
  "Want to sing another one?" which caused the magpies to call out.

    牛爬犁
    放平大水牛拖着爬犁，爬犁上载着湖草，老爷爷骑上牛背，嘴角上挂着微笑。牛爬犁慢慢地走，大堤上长龙一条，年青人走在后面，一声声唱起来了：
  “家住在洞庭湖上，君山头白云飘飘；你打鱼我种田地，你采茶我摘蟠桃。
  “你放牛我喂骏马，你赶车我修大桥；齐动手建设家园，公社里快乐逍遥！”年青人唱得真妙，老爷爷手舞足蹈；牛背上清清嗓子，放开声唱个小调：
  “白胡子用手捋捋，老黄忠可不服老！清早起湖边走走，带上了一把钢刀。
  “杀杀杀白光闪闪，一挥手一堆青草。手脚快人也痛快，回复了青春年少！
  “今日里打草一天，赛当年十天十宵。为国家也为后人，急忙忙运回肥料！”大堤上牛角弯弯，牛爬犁跟着牛跑，牛角上挂着晚霞，月牙儿上了柳梢。老爷爷唱得带劲，年轻人齐声喊好，
  “要不要再来一个？”引起了喜鹊直叫。
