Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 15th: The Soviet delegation submitted a draft peace treaty with Germany at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 15th. The head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, also delivered a speech on the issue of signing a peace treaty with Germany at the meeting.

The meeting on the 15th was chaired by the head of the British delegation, Lloyd.

Gromyko said that, as agreed in the exchanges of notes before the convening of this conference, this meeting would discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. He said that although fourteen years have passed since the end of the war, there has still been no peace treaty between Germany and the former anti-Hitler alliance countries. The unresolved issues left over from the war seriously hinder relations between countries, and these issues are often the source of friction, disagreement, and suspicion between countries.

Gromyko continued that many aspects of the foreign policy of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany are aimed at intensifying international tensions, which naturally cannot but arouse people's vigilance. When the Federal Republic of Germany openly expresses its territorial ambitions, how can European countries, especially those bordering Germany, feel at ease? This uneasiness makes the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany even more urgent, because a peace treaty with Germany would be a guarantee for the peaceful development of the entire Germany.

After reviewing the experience of cooperation among the anti-Hitler allies during the war years, Gromyko said that if we want to seek ways to continue this cooperation, then we must first solve the common problems left over from the war among the allies. Among these problems, the peace treaty with Germany is undoubtedly the main one. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany can also provide us with the key to solving a series of other problems that separate our countries.

Gromyko talked about the basic reason put forward by opponents of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, which is that there is no government that can represent the whole of Germany to sign the treaty and guarantee compliance with the treaty obligations. Gromyko said: This reason can never be considered correct and convincing. This reason starts from extremely formal legal considerations, which are very unsuitable under the current conditions. The basis of this reason is a deliberate disregard for the actual situation in Germany, because two independent countries have long existed on German territory. Does not the very fact that there are official representatives of the governments of these two countries present at our meeting convincingly prove that we can no longer close our eyes to the facts?

The head of the Soviet delegation continued that knowing that the process of establishing an all-German government in Germany is complex and lengthy, but waiting for it means indefinitely delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and ignoring the possibility of an early reunification of the German nation. If the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany are unable to formulate a common program for rapprochement due to the position of the West German government, and this program should largely be formulated by the peace treaty, then how can a unified Germany be our counterpart for concluding a peace treaty? This should take into account the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany is only creating more and more obstacles on the road to bringing the two Germanys closer together.

Gromyko said that considering the current actual situation, the Soviet government believes that the only possibility at present is to conclude a peace treaty with both Germanys, and if a German confederation is established before the conclusion of the peace treaty, then a peace treaty should be concluded with the German confederation as well as with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Gromyko said that some people are trying to justify their negative attitude towards the proposal to make peace with Germany by claiming that they only recognize one Germany. Gromyko said that we know that certain groups in the West do not like the social system of the German Democratic Republic, but indulging in emotions to the point of not being able to calmly deal with the facts is politically most inappropriate. The fact is that the German Democratic Republic has fully recognized all the goals announced in the Allied agreements on Germany and guarantees to achieve all these goals.

Gromyko said that people should also not ignore the fact that if the issue of German reunification mainly concerns the Germans, then the issue of the peace treaty affects the interests of the people of many countries in Europe—and not just Europe—and the solution of this issue will be a major step towards strengthening European security. Of course, the issue of German reunification is extremely important, but since the Federal Republic of Germany is not yet prepared to reach an agreement with the German Democratic Republic on ways to solve this problem, then it is clear that there is no other way but to wait for the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to adopt a more realistic attitude. The peace treaty is another matter. Delaying the solution of this problem is harmful not only to the German people, but also to the people of other countries and to the common cause of peace. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the Foreign Ministers' Conference should focus its main attention on the issue of the peace treaty with Germany.

Gromyko talked about the content of the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union, and elaborated on the considerations made by the Soviet government when drafting the treaty. When talking about the relationship between the peace treaty and the withdrawal of troops, he said that as an advocate of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany, the Soviet government sees nothing that prevents the withdrawal of troops within one year after the peace treaty takes effect. However, if the three Western countries and the Federal Republic of Germany are not prepared to do so, then foreign troops can be gradually withdrawn from Germany, with the time limit to be decided by the parties concerned through consultation; as for the number of foreign troops stationed on German territory, it is recommended that it be reduced by one-third within six months after the peace treaty takes effect.

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet government's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany includes a simultaneous solution to the Berlin issue. In this document, the solution to the Berlin issue is an integral part of the overall plan for making peace with Germany. With the signing of the peace treaty, the four-power agreement governing and occupying Germany—including Berlin—will also become invalid. In this way, the occupation system that West Berlin currently maintains will no longer exist. This raises the issue of determining the status of West Berlin before Germany is restored to unification and Berlin has not become the capital of a unified Germany. The Soviet government believes that granting West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city is the most appropriate solution.

We are also prepared to jointly study corresponding guarantees for West Berlin with other relevant countries.

Gromyko also talked about the proposals submitted by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on May 14 for discussion at the meeting. He said that this document mentions the issue of disarmament, the issue of Berlin, the issue of European security, the issue of German reunification, and the issue of making peace with Germany. Moreover, it says that this document should be studied as an indivisible whole. He said that we carefully listened to the successive speeches of the US Secretary of State and the Foreign Ministers of France and Britain. The Soviet delegation has already expressed its attitude towards this method of twisting many complex issues of different natures into a knot, thereby making their solution a more complex and essentially impossible task. If we go down this road, there will only be one result—leading all the work into a dead end from the very beginning. Gromyko said that after some time, the Soviet delegation will state its views on the substance of the proposals in the three-country document in more detail.

After Gromyko's speech, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd then spoke. He said that he disagreed with the head of the Soviet delegation's analysis of the division of Europe into two military camps and with the statements about the Federal Republic of Germany. He also said that he would study Gromyko's speech and then present his own views.

Lloyd then provided additional explanations on the "peace plan" proposal put forward by the West at the meeting on the 14th. He praised the part of the Western plan concerning German reunification, ignoring the fact that the reunification of the two Germanys should be decided by the German people themselves and should not be discussed at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Lloyd then spoke in detail about another part of the Western plan, namely the complex issues related to European security, including the reduction of armaments and armed forces, despite the fact that the attempt to solve various political issues in a bundle would only hinder the solution of the main issue, namely the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

After Lloyd delivered his speech, the meeting on the 15th came to an end. The next meeting will continue on May 18.

### 苏联向外长会议提出对德和约草案  葛罗米柯说缔结对德和约能提供解决其他问题的钥匙  指出西方把复杂问题扭成一团只能把会议引入死胡同

    苏联向外长会议提出对德和约草案
    葛罗米柯说缔结对德和约能提供解决其他问题的钥匙
    指出西方把复杂问题扭成一团只能把会议引入死胡同
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦15日讯：苏联代表团15日在日内瓦外长会议上提出了一项对德和约草案。苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯并在会上就签订对德和约问题发表了演说。
    15日的会议由英国代表团团长劳埃德主持。
    葛罗米柯说，根据在这次会议召开以前互致的照会中所商定的，这次会议将讨论对德和约问题。他说，虽然战争结束已达十四年，但是，在德国和过去的反希特勒同盟国之间，至今还没有媾和。战争遗留下来的悬而未决的问题严重地妨碍着国与国之间的关系，这些问题经常是各国之间产生磨擦、分歧和怀疑的根源。
    葛罗米柯继续说道，德意志联邦共和国政府的外交政策的很多方面，目的都在加剧国际紧张局势，这自然不能不引起人们的警惕。当德意志联邦共和国公开表露了自己的领土野心时，欧洲各国，特别是同德国的毗邻国家怎么能感到安心呢。这种不安使得缔结对德和约变得更加迫切了。因为对德和约会是整个德国和平发展的一种保障。
    葛罗米柯在回顾反希特勒同盟在战争年代的合作经验之后说，如果想寻求继续这种合作的途径，那么自然首先得解决战争所遗留下来的、盟国之间共同的问题，在这些问题中，对德和约无疑是主要的问题，缔结对德和约也能使我们获得解决其他一系列把我们这些国家隔开的问题的钥匙。
    葛罗米柯谈到缔结对德和约反对者所提出的基本理由，这个理由就是：现在没有能够代表全德国签订和约和保证遵守和约义务的政府。葛罗米柯说：这个理由决不能认为是正确的和令人信服的。这个理由是从极端形式的法学上的考虑出发的，这些考虑在目前条件下是很不适合的。这个理由的基础是蓄意轻视德国的实际情况，因为在德国领土上，早就存在两个自主的国家。难道在我们会场上有这两个国家政府的正式代表出席的这个事实本身不是令人信服地证明不能再闭眼不看事实了吗？
    苏联代表团团长继续说，明知目前在德国建立全德政府的过程是复杂和漫长的，但是却要等待，这就意味着无限期拖延缔结对德和约，并且忽视早日使德国民族重新统一的可能性。如果德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国由于西德政府的立场而无法制定彼此接近的共同纲领，而这个纲领恰恰在很大程度上应该由和约来制定，那末，怎么可能把统一的德国作为我们缔结和约的对方呢。这应当考虑到这种情况，即德意志联邦共和国只是在使两个德国接近的道路上制造越来越多的障碍。
    葛罗米柯说，考虑到当前的实际情况，苏联政府认为，目前唯一的可能就是同两个德国缔结和约，而如果在缔结和约以前成立德国邦联，那么，就同德国邦联以及同德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国缔结和约。
    葛罗米柯说，有人企图为自己对同德国媾和的建议采取否定态度进行辩解，他们的借口是，他们只承认一个德国。葛罗米柯说，我们知道，西方某些集团不喜欢德意志民主共和国的社会制度，但是，放纵感情，以致不能冷静地对待事实，这在政治上是最不适宜的。而事实是，德意志民主共和国已经完全承认盟国关于德国的协议中所宣布的一切目标，并且保证要实现这一切目标。
    葛罗米柯说，人们也不应当忽略这个事实：如果说，德国统一问题主要关系到德国人的话，那么，和约问题却影响到欧洲——而且不仅仅是欧洲——许多国家人民的利益，这个问题的解决将是向加强欧洲安全方面迈进的一大步。当然，德国统一问题是极其重要的，但是，既然德意志联邦共和国还不准备就解决这个问题的途径同德意志民主共和国达成协议，那末，很明显，除了等待德意志联邦共和国政府采取一种比较现实的态度以外，没有其他办法。和约则是另外一回事。拖延解决这个问题，不仅对德国人民，而且对其他各国的人民，对共同的和平事业，都是有害的。因此，苏联政府认为，外长会议应当把主要注意力集中在对德和约问题上。
    葛罗米柯谈到了苏联提出的对德和约草案的内容，并阐述了苏联政府在起草和约时所作的考虑。他在谈到和约同撤军的关系时说，作为外国军队撤出德国的拥护者，苏联政府看不出有什么东西阻碍着在和约生效后的一年以内实现撤军。但是，如果三个西方国家和德意志联邦共和国还不准备这样做，那末可以逐渐地从德国撤出外国军队，期限由有关方面协商决定；至于驻在德国领土上的外国军队的人数，建议在和约生效后六个月内缩减三分之一。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联政府关于缔结对德和约的建议包括同时解决柏林问题。在这个文件里，柏林问题的解决是同德国媾和的总方案的一个组成部分。随着和约的签订，规定管理和占领德国——其中包括柏林——的四国协定也就失效了。这样一来，西柏林目前仍然保持的占领制度也就不再存在。这里就产生了确定西柏林在德国尚未恢复统一和柏林还没有成为统一的德国的首都以前的地位问题。苏联政府认为，给予西柏林非军事化自由城市的地位是最适当的解决办法。
    我们同时也准备同其他有关国家共同研究对西柏林的相应的保障。
    葛罗米柯还谈到了美、英、法三国政府5月14日提交会议讨论的建议。他说，在这个文件中提到了裁军问题，还有柏林问题，还有欧洲安全问题，还有德国统一问题，也还有同德国媾和的问题。而且说，这个文件应当作为一个不可分割的整体来研究。他说，我们仔细听取了美国国务卿和法、英两国外长相继的发言。苏联代表团已经对这样一种方法表示了自己的态度，这种方法就是把许多性质不同的复杂问题扭成一团，从而使它们的解决变成一项更加复杂的、实质上是不可能完成的任务。如果走这条道路，那么只会有一个结果——一开始就把全部工作引入死胡同。葛罗米柯说，再过一些时候，苏联代表团将更详细地就三国文件中建议的实质陈述自己的看法。
    在葛罗米柯演说后，英国外交大臣劳埃德接着发言。他表示他不同意苏联代表团团长对欧洲分裂成为两个军事阵营的分析和关于德意志联邦共和国的情况的说法。他还说，他将研究葛罗米柯的演说，然后提出自己的看法。
    劳埃德接着对西方在14日会上提出的“和平计划”的建议作了补充说明。他极力称赞西方计划中关于德国重新统一的部分，而无视两个德国的统一应由德国人民自己去决定、不应由日内瓦外长会议来讨论的这一事实。
    劳埃德然后又详细地谈到西方计划中的另一部分，即包括裁减军备和武装部队等范围极广的有关欧洲安全的复杂的问题，尽管把各种政治问题打成一个结来同时解决的企图只会妨碍主要问题、即签订对德和约问题的解决。
    劳埃德发表演说后，15日会议便告结束。下次会议将在5月18日继续举行。
