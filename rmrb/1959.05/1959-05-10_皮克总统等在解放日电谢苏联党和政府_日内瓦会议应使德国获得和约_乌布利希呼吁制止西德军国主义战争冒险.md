Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th. President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber Dieckmann, Prime Minister Grotewohl, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany Ulbricht, and Chairman of the National Council of the National Front Correns sent a telegram on the 8th to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, congratulating them on the victory of the Soviet army in defeating Hitler's Wehrmacht and the fourteenth anniversary of the liberation of the German people.
    The telegram stated that the German people expect the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference to make positive contributions to preparing for a summit meeting, easing international tensions, and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. The telegram said that any delay in concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the West Berlin issue would only benefit the exacerbation of tensions in Europe and the expansion of a new world war crisis.
    The telegram stated that the government of the German Democratic Republic resolutely condemns the efforts of the West German government to create difficulties for the Geneva negotiations.
    The telegram said that we will do our best to make the Geneva Conference a success, thereby promoting the rapid convening of a peace conference and enabling Germany to obtain a peace treaty fourteen years after the end of the war.
    The telegram finally expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet army for helping the German people liberate themselves from fascism and paving the way for the German people to happiness, prosperity, and peace.
    On the 8th, thousands of Berlin citizens laid wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial. President Pieck, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the People's Chamber, the Council of Ministers, the National Council of the National Front, the Communist Party of Germany, the Soviet Embassy, and the German-Soviet Friendship Association also laid wreaths.
    Residents of Leipzig, Karl Marx City, and other places also laid wreaths at the local Soviet Martyrs Cemetery on the same day.
    In West Berlin, despite the police's best efforts to obstruct them, residents of West Berlin continued to lay wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial in West Berlin.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. Ulbricht, First Secreatry of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Deputy Prime Minister, delivered a speech on the 7th at the Third German Building Conference on the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference, the peace policy of the German Democratic Republic, and other topics.
    When talking about the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, he said that the convening of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference and the preparation for a summit meeting show that, thanks to the great peace initiatives of the Soviet Union, there has been some easing of international tensions. However, the Bonn government opposes further easing of tensions and opposes the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. He pointed out that now, on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, it is very clear that the majority of the German people want to conclude a peace treaty. The Bonn government's policy of annexing the German Democratic Republic has reached a dead end.
    Ulbricht then pointed out that this upcoming international negotiation faces a very clear problem: after the resurgence of West German militarism and the atomic arming of the West German army have made West Germany and West Berlin dangerous hotbeds of military provocations, the necessity of finding a path leading to a peaceful solution to the German question is very obvious. The people of the world cannot allow the militaristic ruling group in West Germany to launch a civil war in Germany and cause an all-out war.
    Ulbricht said that the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic is going to Geneva to put forward a new German policy, which also receives a broad response in West Germany. This policy is a thorough peace policy, which confronts Bonn's policy of imperialist expansion. He pointed out that the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic in Geneva will not only defend the peaceful interests of the citizens of the German Democratic Republic but also defend the peaceful interests of all peace-loving Germans. It has the right to represent them because the Potsdam Agreement has been thoroughly implemented in the German Democratic Republic and the first German peace state has been established.
    Ulbricht said that the new thing in the current situation is that the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic has proved that Germany's peace and progress start from here. The German Democratic Republic government's peace policy and the great progress of the Republic's socialist construction and new cultural development have enhanced the prestige of the German Democratic Republic in Europe and around the world. The participation of the German Democratic Republic government delegation in the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference means the de facto recognition of the German Democratic Republic. The international position of the German Democratic Republic as a peaceful force and a German peace bastion is growing. Anyone who sincerely hopes to establish a state of peace in Germany and Western Europe must establish normal diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic.
    Ulbricht emphasized that concluding peace treaties with the two Germanys will pave the way for achieving German unification through the establishment of a confederation of the two Germanys. The peace treaty will guarantee the peaceful development of Germany. Through the conclusion of a peace treaty, Germany will become a zone of peace in Europe.
    Ulbricht finally criticized the Bonn government's attitude of opposing talks between the delegations of the two Germanys on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference.

　　皮克总统等在解放日电谢苏联党和政府
    日内瓦会议应使德国获得和约
    乌布利希呼吁制止西德军国主义战争冒险
    新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国总统皮克、人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、总理格罗提渥、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯8日打电报给苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会，祝贺苏联军队击败希特勒国防军胜利日和德国人民解放十四周年。
    贺电说，德国人民期待日内瓦外长会议将会为准备最高级会议、缓和国际紧张局势和缔结对德和约作出积极的贡献。电报说，对缔结对德和约和西柏林问题解决的任何拖延只会有利于加剧欧洲的紧张局势和扩大新的世界战争危机。
    电报说，德意志民主共和国政府坚决谴责西德政府为日内瓦谈判所制造困难的努力。
    贺电说，我们将尽力促使日内瓦会议成功，从而促使和会的迅速召开并使德国在战争结束十四年之后获得和约。
    贺电最后对苏联军队帮助德国人民从法西斯主义下解放出来和帮助德国人民铺平了走向幸福、繁荣与和平的道路表示深切的感谢。
    8日成千上万的柏林市民向苏军烈士纪念碑献了花圈。皮克总统、德国统一社会党中央委员会、人民议院、部长会议、全国阵线全国委员会、德国共产党、苏联大使馆和德苏友好协会也都献了花圈。
    来比锡、卡尔·马克思城等地的居民同一天也向当地的苏联烈士陵园献了花圈。
    在西柏林虽然警察竭力阻挠，但西柏林的居民仍络绎不断的向西柏林的苏军烈士纪念碑献了花圈。
    新华社柏林8日电　德国统一社会党中央第一书记、德意志民主共和国部长会议第一副总理乌布利希7日下午在第三届德国建筑会议上就东西方外长会议、德意志民主共和国的和平政策等发表演说。
    他在谈到即将召开的日内瓦外长会议时说，日内瓦外长会议的召开和最高级会议的准备表明，由于苏联伟大的和平倡议，国际紧张局势有了某些缓和。但是，波恩政府反对进一步缓和紧张局势，反对不同社会制度的国家的和平共处。他指出，现在，在日内瓦外长会议前夕，很清楚，大部分德国人民要缔结和约。目的在于并吞德意志民主共和国的波恩政府政策已经陷入了死胡同。
    乌布利希接着指出，这个即将来到的国际谈判面临着一个十分明白的问题，就是在西德军国主义再起和西德军队原子武装已使西德和西柏林成为军事挑衅的危险温床以后，寻找一条引向和平解决德国问题的道路的必要性就是十分明显的了。全世界人民不能让西德的军国主义统治集团在德国发动一次内战而造成全面战争。
    乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国政府代表团到日内瓦去提出新的德国的政策，这个政策在西德也同样得到广泛的响应。这个政策是一个彻底的和平政策，它同波恩的帝国主义扩张政策相抗衡。他指出，德意志民主共和国政府代表团在日内瓦将不仅是保卫德意志民主共和国公民也是保卫所有爱好和平的德国人的和平利益。它有权代表他们，因为在德意志民主共和国已经彻底执行了波茨坦协定并建立了第一个德国的和平国家。
    乌布利希说，当前形势中新的事物就是德意志民主共和国的工农政权证明了德国的和平和进步是从它这里出发的。德意志民主共和国政府的和平政策以及共和国的社会主义建设和新文化发展的巨大进展提高了德意志民主共和国在欧洲和全世界的威信。德意志民主共和国政府代表团参加日内瓦外长会议，意味着对德意志民主共和国的事实上承认。作为和平力量和德国和平堡垒的德意志民主共和国的国际地位日益增长。谁要是诚意地盼望在德国和西欧建立和平状态，它就必须同德意志民主共和国建立正常的外交关系。
    乌布利希强调说，同两个德国缔结和约，将为通过建立两个德国的邦联来达成德国统一铺平道路。和约将保证德国的和平发展。通过缔结和约，德国将成为欧洲的和平区。
    乌布利希最后指责了波恩政府在日内瓦外长会议前夕，反对两个德国代表团会谈的态度。
