    The Great Leap Forward Cannot Neglect Thrift
    Since the Great Leap Forward, some comrades have developed a misconception that with the Great Leap Forward, there is no need to advocate thrift. They have pitted thrift against the Great Leap Forward in production, fearing that advocating thrift would affect the masses' enthusiasm for construction and diminish the vigorous Great Leap Forward situation. Under the control of this thinking, they turned a blind eye to some extravagance and waste, adopting an attitude of seeing nothing and hearing nothing. Some comrades put forward the so-called argument that increasing production is saving, which in reality means not saving. Therefore, some production units and economic departments have seen phenomena such as neglecting thrift, not paying attention to cost accounting, and not considering economic results.
    In order to accelerate socialist construction, our country must accumulate a large amount of construction funds. The source of socialist construction funds relies on the accumulation within the socialist economy. To ensure the continuous increase of construction funds, on the one hand, we must strive to increase production, and on the other hand, we must implement strict thrift. In our country, there is a huge possibility to realize increased production and thrift. Thrift is not a temporary measure as some comrades say, but a basic operating principle of the socialist economy. We should fully utilize the enormous possibilities of the socialist economy to implement thrift, greatly promote and strictly practice thrift, in order to ensure the rapid development of production.
    Our country is a large country with a backward economy. Although the initial foundation for industrialization was laid due to the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, and although the Great Leap Forward has led to a high-speed growth of industrial and agricultural products, it has not fundamentally changed our country's backward economic situation. Due to the thin foundation and large population, the growth of products, despite accelerating, still cannot meet the growing needs of production and life. Therefore, in the Great Leap Forward, we must always maintain a clear head, and no matter what we do, we must proceed from our country's real economic situation, from a large country with more than 600 million people, and be meticulous in our calculations and strictly practice thrift in everything we do. We cannot think that the Great Leap Forward allows us to be extravagant and regard meticulous calculations and strict thrift as petty. Chairman Mao said in the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "We want to carry out large-scale construction, but our country is still a very poor country, which is a contradiction. Comprehensively and persistently practicing thrift is a way to resolve this contradiction."
    The Great Leap Forward in the national economy generally refers to speed. Because speed is the main symbol of a country's economic level improvement. However, the growth of speed depends not only on increasing production, but also on strictly practicing thrift. Increasing production and saving are two legs of the Great Leap Forward, and neither is dispensable. Of course, the growth of production speed is manifested through the growth of output, that is, through improving labor productivity and expanding the means of production. And the improvement of labor productivity is itself a kind of saving, because it saves the labor time for creating wealth. Expanding the means of production requires carrying out basic construction, which also requires strictly practicing thrift to accumulate construction funds. Therefore, thrift and leap forward are closely linked and are an important condition for ensuring the Great Leap Forward. Without strict thrift, it is impossible to achieve high-speed development of production.

### 大跃进不能忽视节约

    大跃进不能忽视节约
    自大跃进以来，有些同志发生了错觉，认为大跃进了，就没有什么必要提倡节约了。他们把节约和生产大跃进对立起来，怕提倡节约会影响群众的建设热情，使轰轰烈烈的大跃进形势减色。在这种思想的支配下，他们见到一些铺张浪费现象也不加反对，抱着视之不见、听之不闻的态度。有的同志提出所谓增产就是节约的论点，实际上就是不要节约。因此，在一些生产单位和经济部门中就出现了不注意节约、不注意计算成本和不考虑经济效果的现象。
    我们国家为了加快社会主义建设，就必须积累大量的建设资金。社会主义建设资金的来源，是依靠于社会主义经济内部的积累。为了保证建设资金的不断增加，一方面要努力增加生产，另一方面要实行严格的节约。在我们国家里，有着实现增产节约的巨大可能性。节约并不是像某些同志所说的是一个什么临时性的措施，而是社会主义经济的基本经营原则。我们应当充分地利用社会主义经济实行节约的巨大可能性，大大地提倡和厉行节约，以保证生产的迅速发展。
    我国是一个经济落后的大国。虽然由于第一个五年计划的实现而打下了工业化的初步基础，虽然大跃进使工农业产品有了高速度的增长，但是，还没有根本地改变我国落后的经济状况。由于底子薄、人口多，产品的增长尽管加快，还是不能满足生产和生活的日益增长的需要。所以，我们在大跃进中，必须时刻保持清醒的头脑，不论办什么事都要从我国的现实经济状况出发，从六亿多人口的大国出发，处处精打细算，厉行节约。不能认为大跃进就可以大手大脚，把精打细算、厉行节约看成是小里小气。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中讲过：“我们要进行大规模的建设，但是我国还是一个很穷的国家，这是一个矛盾。全面地持久地厉行节约，就是解决这个矛盾的一个方法。”
    国民经济的大跃进，一般是指速度说的。因为速度是一个国家经济水平提高的主要标志。但是速度的增长，不仅取决于增加生产，也取决于厉行节约。增产与节约是大跃进的两条腿，是缺一不可的。当然生产速度的增长是通过产量的增长来表现的，也即是通过提高劳动生产率和扩大生产手段来实现的。而劳动生产率的提高，本身就是一种节约，因为它节省了创造财富的劳动时间。扩大生产手段，就要进行基本建设，也需要厉行节约，以积累建设资金。所以，节约和跃进是紧密联系着的，是保证大跃进的一个重要条件。没有严格的节约，实现生产的高速度的发展是不可能的。
