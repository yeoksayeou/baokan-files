Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 18th: Mongolia recently established four new state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms primarily focused on agricultural production in the Central Province, Choibalsan Province, and Khuvsgul Province, near rivers and in areas with fertile soil. With this addition, Mongolia now has twenty-five state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms nationwide.

Mongolia's state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms play an important role in fulfilling the Party and government's goal of vigorously developing agricultural production to meet the needs of the domestic population in the coming years. This year, the planned cultivated area nationwide is 157,000 hectares, of which the cultivated area of state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms accounts for 120,000 hectares. Mongolia has also decided to reclaim 138,000 hectares of wasteland for planting crops next year, of which the state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms will reclaim 122,000 hectares, and the four agricultural and pastoral farms built this year will reclaim 50,000 hectares.

Currently, Mongolian reclamation workers and Soviet technical experts who have come to assist are carrying out reclamation work in various regions.

    蒙古新建四个国营农牧场
    新华社乌兰巴托18日电　蒙古最近在中央省、乔巴山省和库苏古尔省的靠近河流土质肥沃的地区又新建了四个以农业生产为主的国营农牧场。至此，蒙古全国已有二十五个国营农牧场。
    蒙古的国营农牧场在完成党和政府提出的大力发展农业生产以便在最近几年内满足国内人民的需要方面起着重要的作用。今年全国计划耕种的面积为十五万七千公顷，其中国营农牧场的耕种面积就占了十二万公顷。今年蒙古还决定开垦十三万八千公顷荒地供明年种植作物，其中国营农牧场将开荒十二万二千公顷，而今年兴建的四个农牧场就要开荒五万公顷。
    目前，蒙古的开荒人员和前来帮助的苏联技术专家们正在各地进行垦荒工作。
