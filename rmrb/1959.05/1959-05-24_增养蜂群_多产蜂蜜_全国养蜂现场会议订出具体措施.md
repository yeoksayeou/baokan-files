Xinhua News Agency Report: To fully exchange beekeeping experiences and further promote the rapid development of China's beekeeping industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce recently held a National Beekeeping On-Site Conference in Conghua County, Guangdong Province.

By the end of 1958, the number of bees raised across the country had grown to three million colonies. Experiences from various regions have proven that beekeeping not only yields a large amount of honey and beeswax, but also greatly promotes the increased production of certain crops through bee pollination. For example, many nationally renowned rapeseed-producing counties are also counties with relatively developed beekeeping industries. For this reason, the conference called on all regions to actively promote the development of beekeeping.

The conference believes that China has vast territory, a mild climate, and numerous nectariferous plants, providing favorable natural conditions for the development of beekeeping. In particular, in recent years, with the development of afforestation and landscaping movements, various regions across the country have widely planted flowers and trees, and nectar sources are increasing daily. According to a survey in Heilongjiang Province, the province's current nectar sources are estimated to be able to support five million bee colonies. However, in 1958, the province only raised 100,000 bee colonies, leaving huge potential to be tapped. The conference called on all regions to quickly organize forces to identify nectar sources, make plans for protecting wild nectar sources and gradually expanding nectar source bases, and develop beekeeping production rapidly in a planned manner.

The conference pointed out that improving beekeeping methods is the primary key to rapidly developing the beekeeping industry. More than two-thirds of the bees raised across the country are native Chinese bees, and these bee colonies are mostly kept in fixed hives such as bamboo cages and wooden buckets. These old-fashioned hives can only use backward methods of destroying the honeycomb to extract honey, and the honey produced is not only of poor quality and low quantity, but also affects the reproduction speed of the bee colony, making it impossible to control swarming. Experiences from various provinces have proven that as long as the old-fashioned fixed hives are replaced with movable-frame hives, plus appropriate management and the use of honey extractors, bee colonies can be rapidly increased and the output and quality of honey can be greatly improved. For example, Jiangpu Commune in Conghua County converted 486 bamboo cage bee colonies to movable-frame hives in 1957, and in just over a year, they have developed to more than 5,500 colonies. Moreover, during the honey season of less than 30 days this spring, each colony produced an average of more than 35 catties of honey. The conference called on all regions to strive to convert all native Chinese bees to movable-frame hives within one or two years.

The conference also affirmed that native Chinese bees have the characteristics of being diligent in collecting honey, producing more honey, being resistant to cold and heat, being good at escaping enemies, and having a keen sense of smell. It called on all regions to carefully select and breed excellent varieties from local bees. The representatives also believed that there are still many wild bees in the mountains and fields, and capturing these wild bees is a good way to solve the current shortage of bee breeds and run bee farms diligently and thriftily.

The conference also discussed issues such as bee equipment reform, the supply of beekeeping materials, the feeding and management of bee colonies, and scientific research on beekeeping.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Heilongjiang Province, China's northernmost province, is now in the season when various fruit trees, flowers, and wildflowers are in full bloom. The 100,000 bee colonies raised by the people's communes in Raohe County, known as the "hometown of bees," and Shangzhi and Wuchang counties, which are rich in honey, are busy collecting honey among the flowers. A large amount of honey can be harvested by mid-to-late June. (Attached picture)

### 增养蜂群  多产蜂蜜  全国养蜂现场会议订出具体措施

    增养蜂群  多产蜂蜜
    全国养蜂现场会议订出具体措施
    据新华社讯　为了充分交流养蜂经验，进一步推动我国养蜂事业的迅速发展，农业部和商业部最近在广东省从化县召开了全国养蜂现场会议。
  　到1958年底，全国各地饲养的蜜蜂已经发展到三百万群。各地经验证明，养蜂不仅能够收到大量蜂蜜和蜂蜡，而且通过蜜蜂传授花粉，还能大大促进某些农作物增产。如许多全国有名的油菜丰产县，都是养蜂事业比较发达的县份。为此会议要求各地积极推动养蜂事业的发展。
    会议认为，我国幅员广阔，气候温和，蜜源植物繁多，对于发展养蜂具有良好的自然条件。特别是近几年来，随着绿化大地和园林化运动的开展，全国各地广种花木，蜜源日益增多。据黑龙江省调查，全省现在蜜源估计可养五百万群蜂。但1958年全省只饲养了十万群蜂，还有巨大潜力可挖。会议要求各地迅速组织力量查清蜜源，做好保护野生蜜源和逐步扩大蜜源基地的规划，有计划地迅速发展养蜂生产。
    会议指出，改良养蜂方法，是当前迅速发展养蜂事业的首要关键。全国各地饲养的蜜蜂有三分之二以上是本国蜂，这些蜂群大都饲养在竹笼、木桶等固定蜂巢中；这些旧式蜂巢只能采用落后的方法毁脾取蜜，生产出来的蜂蜜不仅质劣量少，而且影响到蜂群繁殖速度，无法控制分群。各省经验证明，只要把旧式的固定蜂巢改为活框蜂箱饲养，加上适当的管理和改用摇蜜机取蜜，就能迅速增殖蜂群和大大提高蜂蜜的产量和质量。如从化县江浦公社1957年将四百八十六群竹笼蜂改用活框蜂箱饲养，到现在不过一年多，就发展到五千五百多群；而且在今春不到三十天的蜜期中，平均每群生产了蜂蜜三十五斤多。会议要求各地力争在一两年内，把全部本国蜂改用活框蜂箱饲养。
    会议还肯定本国蜂具有采蜜勤、产蜜多、耐寒热、善于逃避敌害和嗅觉灵敏等特点，要求各地精心选育，从当地的蜜蜂中选育出出色的好品种。代表们还认为，山野里还有很多野生蜂，收捕这些野生蜂，是解决当前蜂种缺乏和勤俭办蜂场的好办法。
    会议还就蜂具改革、养蜂物资供应、蜂群的饲养管理和养蜂的科学研究工作等问题进行了讨论。
    据新华社讯　我国最北部的黑龙江省，现在正是各种果树鲜花和野花盛开的季节。被称为蜜蜂之乡的饶河县和盛产蜂蜜的尚志、五常等县各人民公社饲养的十万群蜜蜂，正在鲜花丛中忙着采蜜。到6月中下旬就可以割到大批的蜂蜜。（附图片）
