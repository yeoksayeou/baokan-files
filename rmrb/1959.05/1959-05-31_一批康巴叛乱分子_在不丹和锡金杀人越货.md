Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th: Some Khamba rebels who fled to Bhutan and Sikkim are murdering and plundering in these two countries.

According to a report in the "Free Press" on the 29th, the Chairman of the Bhutan Congress Party, Koirala, stated in Siliguri that 1,500 Khamba rebels had entered Bhutan and had already begun to loot property and persecute the people.

The statement also said that several members of the Dupa Karga family in Bhutan were killed by these Khamba people, which caused great alarm.

The Bhutan Congress Party has requested India and Bhutan to take steps to protect the people from the harm of these Khamba people.

According to a report in the "Statesman" from Gangtok, police sources there received news on the 26th that four Khamba rebels who had infiltrated into Sikkim through the Jelep La Pass—Sikkim's highest mountain pass—attacked an isolated guard post near the Nathang checkpoint on May 14th, killing the five people inside and stealing decorations worth approximately 8,000 rupees. According to news that just arrived in Gangtok, two Khambas, identified as members of this gang, have been arrested in Kalimpong with the help of the Sikkim police. The whereabouts of the other two Khambas are unknown. It is now believed that these Khamba murderers sneaked into Sikkim from Bhutan.

    一批康巴叛乱分子
    在不丹和锡金杀人越货
    新华社新德里30日电　一些逃窜到不丹和锡金的康巴叛乱分子在这两个国家杀人越货。
    据“自由报”29日报道，不丹大会党主席柯伊拉腊在西里古里发表声明说，有一千五百名康巴叛乱分子进入不丹，并且已经开始抢劫财产，迫害人民。
    声明又说，不丹杜帕卡家族的若干人被这些康巴人杀死了，这使得人们非常惊恐。
    不丹大会党已经要求印度和不丹采取步骤，使人们免遭这些康巴人的危害。
    另据“政治家报”从甘托克报道，那里26日接到的警察方面的消息说，通过则拉普关——锡金最高的山口——渗入锡金境内的四个康巴叛乱分子在5月14日袭击了纳坦检查站附近的一个孤立的防哨，杀死了防哨内的五个人，抢走了约值八千卢比的装饰品。据刚到达甘托克的消息说，两名被认明是这个匪帮中的匪徒的康巴已在噶伦堡在锡金警察的帮助下被捕。其它两名康巴还不知下落。现在人们认为，这些康巴杀人犯是从不丹潜入锡金的。
