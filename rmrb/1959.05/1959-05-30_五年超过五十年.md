Five Years Surpassing Fifty
By our reporter Chen Jiabao

“When the French colonialists left, they determined that our factory would ‘close down,’ but they were happy too early. Not only did our factory not ‘close down,’ but the achievements made in the five years after the takeover exceeded the fifty years of French management.” These words were said to the reporter by Nguyen Luc, the head of the trade union at the Hanoi Power Plant. His words were full of pride.

Five years ago, on the eve of Hanoi's liberation, the French boss of this power plant said angrily to the workers: "Let you people fumble around blindly! Without us French, don't even think about having electric lights."

From that moment on, this factory, built fifty years ago with the blood and sweat of the Vietnamese people, began to return to the hands of the Vietnamese people, and from then on entered the most glorious era in its life history. The Vietnamese workers, once scolded as "stupid" by the French, have not only managed this power plant well in the past five years, but also created hundreds of new instruments and tools, producing twice the amount of electricity as during the French rule, bringing light to six cities including Hanoi, Hai Duong, and Nam Dinh, and supplying electricity to a large number of factories in these cities.

While introducing the above situation to me, Nguyen Luc took the reporter to the power plant's "Technical Reform Exhibition Room."

This is one of the many small exhibition rooms currently being held in many factories in North Vietnam. It displays the results of hundreds of rationalization proposals and inventions made by the power plant workers in the past three years. From using cinder to make cement to using waste to make the first Vietnamese-made electric meter, each exhibit contains the infinite wisdom and soaring drive of the Vietnamese working class who have stood up.

In the early days of Hanoi's liberation, the power plant encountered a series of difficulties. In the past, many of the factory's equipment were imported from France, but now they needed to be manufactured themselves. There were also a large number of operational technical principles that needed to be learned quickly, because the French had never been willing to teach the technology to Vietnamese workers. However, these difficulties did not frighten the Vietnamese workers. Under the leadership of the factory committee of the Labor Party, all the workers of the factory launched a lively discussion, exchanged experiences, explored and studied hard in practice; if they didn't understand, they asked experts from fraternal countries for advice. In this way, they relied on the collective wisdom to overcome all difficulties, so the factory's production never stopped from the first day of Hanoi's liberation.

In the first two or three years after the restoration of peace, the cooperation and hard work of Vietnamese workers and technical cadres accomplished things that the colonialists could not have dreamed of. In the past, the French believed that French machines could only be repaired if they were taken to France, but now Vietnamese workers can repair them themselves using advanced Soviet experience. In the exhibition room, I saw more than fifty technical reform achievements created by the workers this year. Transformers, electricity meters, motors... etc., that have never been produced in Vietnamese history, can now be manufactured in the factory.

The exhibition room displayed a 50 kVA transformer, which is one of the many flowers of wisdom. In order to "rush to make transformers to dedicate to the Party," the workers organized a shock team. They "dissected" a transformer made in Romania and studied each piece carefully. They looked for old equipment everywhere and tried to cast new tools. After twelve days of hard work, Vietnam's first 50 kVA transformer was finally made ahead of schedule. It once again declared the victory of the wisdom and perseverance of the Vietnamese working class.

From the charts in the exhibition room, the reporter also saw the production achievements made by the power plant in the past five years: the amount of electricity generated has doubled compared to the French rule; the high-voltage lines have been extended by nearly one hundred kilometers; the number of newly built substations is three times more than in the past; the number of residents using electric lights has also increased by more than double. The "slum areas" that were refused electricity supply by the French colonialists in the past have now become bright "labor areas" with lights in every household.

Leaving the exhibition room, Nguyen Luc took the reporter to the power plant's construction site. Entering the boiling construction site, the first thing I saw was the two huge steam boiler workshops being constructed with the help of Poland next to the old power generation workshop. Their capacity is greater than the total capacity of the nine old French boilers in the factory. After these two boilers are built, they will increase the factory's power generation capacity by 8,000 kilowatts, which will then supply lighting and industrial electricity for ten cities in North Vietnam.

Speaking of the old French boilers, the workers here will never forget the boiler explosion accident in 1948. At that time, the furnace had not been washed for a long time, and the furnace wall was covered with a thick layer of water rust. The heat resistance of the furnace was gradually declining, posing a great danger. However, the French capitalists refused to let the Vietnamese workers wash it. One night, the boiler finally couldn't withstand the high temperature and exploded, taking the life of a young Vietnamese worker.

"Accidents like this have not been repeated in the past five years, and will never be repeated again." Nguyen Luc then said humorously: "Those nine 'master boilers' will soon be using the power of the new boilers built with Polish help to extend their lifespan."

At the boiler construction site, the reporter saw Polish experts working with Vietnamese workers. Even under the scorching sun, the experts and workers were still working hard on the high-altitude scaffolding. Their vests were soaked with sweat. As a result of eight months of day and night fighting, they accelerated the progress of the project by 30%, striving to complete the new boiler ahead of schedule in January next year, so that it can be put into production as soon as possible to support the rapidly developing industrial production and construction.

All these huge changes and amazing achievements in the past five years are shining with the light of the new era. However, what can better reflect this new era is the change in people's lives. The reporter interviewed the old electrician Lao Xiao. He has worked in the factory for more than 20 years. The changes in the two eras experienced by the factory have left an indelible impression in his mind. He said: "During the French rule, the workers worked like cattle and horses. At that time, a worker worked twelve hours a day, and after work, he had to mop the floor and clean the room for the factory owner for free. The coal transporters ate rice balls covered with mud while transporting coal at noon, and lay on the coal pile when they were tired at noon. When the workers received their salary at the end of the month, after paying off their debts, their wives and children were still hungry and could not afford a new piece of clothing all year round. Many people spent painful days like this year after year."

"What's more cruel is that the French colonialists didn't talk about labor safety at all." Lao Xiao told me a tragic story with grief. "Twenty years ago, it wasn't like today, using conveyor belts to send coal to the coal tower several feet high, but using manpower to send coal from the ground up. However, there were no railings around the tower opening. One night, the worker Lao Du came back and forth more than a dozen times to transport coal, making him exhausted. At this moment, just as he poured the coal down, his exhausted body also lost its balance. He stepped forward, and fell into the bottomless tower with the coal, never to come out again. He left behind three helpless children..."

"This is just one of the more than two hundred accidents during the French colonial rule. Our generation can never forget these accidents. Only by remembering the old pain can we love the new life more." After the old worker finished talking about these sad things of the past, he turned the topic to today's life. He said: "Now, my monthly income is not only enough for the whole family, but also has a slight surplus. In the past, we couldn't make ends meet, and the whole family was hungry and full for one meal. Now we guarantee full meals every meal. The children also have decent clothes." A smile appeared on the old man's cheeks. He went on to say: "Now, some of my sons are in middle school, and some are working as technicians in the factory. I took off my illiteracy hat last year and am now in the third grade of elementary school at night school. What's more proud is that the French used to refuse to teach me the principles of turbine machines, but now I have learned it in the amateur technical class." The weather-beaten old electrician finally said: "The old days will not come back, and the new days are getting better and better."

    五年超过五十年
    本报记者　陈家保
    “法国殖民者临走时断定我们的工厂就要‘关门’，但是他们乐得过早了，我们的工厂不但没有‘关门’，而且在接管后五年内作出的成绩，超过了法国人管理的五十年。”这段话是河内发电厂的工会负责人阮陆对记者说的。他的话里充满了自豪感。
    五年前，当河内解放的前夕，这个发电厂的法国老板临走的时候曾经气忿忿地对发电厂的工人们说：“让你们这些人打瞎摸吧，没有我们法国人就别想有电灯。”
    从那时起，这座在五十年前用越南人民的血汗建设起来的工厂，开始回到越南人民的手里，并且从此跨进了它的生命史上最光辉的时代。昔日被法国人骂为“蠢才”的越南工人，五年来不但管好了这座发电厂，而且创造了成百件新仪器和工具，生产出两倍于法国人统治时期的电力，给河内、海阳、南定等六个城市带来光明，给这些城市的大批工厂供应电力。
    阮陆一面给我介绍上述的情况，一面把记者带到发电厂的“技术改革展览室”去。
    这是当前越南北方许多工厂举办的许多小型展览室中的一个。这里展出了发电厂工人三年来提出的成百件合理化建议和发明创造的成果。从利用煤渣制成水泥到利用废料制成第一个越南自制的电表，每一件展品都蕴藏着已经站起来的越南工人阶级无穷无尽的智慧和冲天干劲。
    河内解放初期，发电厂遇到一连串的困难。过去，工厂里的许多用具都是从法国进口的，现在需要自己来制造。还有大量操作技术的原理需要迅速学会，因为法国人过去根本不愿意把技术教给越南工人。可是，这些困难吓不倒越南工人。在劳动党工厂委员会的领导下，全厂职工展开热烈的讨论、交流经验，在实践中摸索和苦钻；不懂就请教兄弟国家的专家。他们就这样依靠集体的智慧，战胜了一切困难，因此，工厂的生产从河内解放第一天起就从未停顿过。
    在和平恢复后的头两三年里，越南工人和技术干部的合作和苦钻，做出了殖民者做梦也想不到的事情。过去法国人认为法国的机器只有拿到法国才能修理，现在越南工人运用苏联的先进经验，能够自己修理了。在展览室里，我看见工人们今年创造出来的五十多件技术改革的成果。越南历史上从未生产过的变压器、测电表、电动机……等等，现在厂里都能够自己制造了。
    展览室里陈列着一部五十瓩的变压器，这是许多智慧的花朵中的一朵鲜花。工人们为了“赶制变压器向党献礼”，组织了一个突击小组。他们“剖开”一部罗马尼亚制造的变压器，逐件揣摩学习。他们到处找旧器材，设法铸造新工具。经过十二天的苦干，越南的第一部五十瓩变压器终于提前制成了。它又一次宣告越南工人阶级的智慧和毅力取得了胜利。
    记者从展览室的图表上，还看到发电厂五年来所取得的生产成绩：发电量比法国统治时期增长两倍；高压线伸长了将近一百公里；新建的变电所比过去多三倍；居民使用电灯的盏数也增加一倍以上。过去被法国殖民者拒绝供电的“贫民区”，现在已经成为家家户户亮堂堂的“劳动区”了。
    走出展览室，阮陆把记者带到发电厂的工地去。进入沸腾的工地，首先看见紧靠着那幢老发电车间的旁边，两个巨大的由波兰帮助建设的蒸汽锅炉车间正在施工建设。它们的容量比厂里九个法国老锅炉的总容量还大。这两个锅炉建成后，将使工厂的发电能力增加八千瓩，那时将可供应北越十个城市的照明和工业用电。
    提起法国老锅炉，这里的工人永远不会忘却1948年的锅炉爆炸事故，那时炉子久不刷洗，炉壁上长满一层厚厚的水锈。炉的耐热力日渐衰退，潜伏着极大的危险。但是法国资本家拒绝让越南工人冲洗。一个夜晚，锅炉终于经不住高温而爆炸，夺去了一个越南青年工人的生命。
    “像这样的事故五年来没有重演，也永远不会重演了。”阮陆接着饶有风趣地说：“那九个‘老爷炉’不久就要借着波兰帮助新建的炉子的力量来延长它的寿命了。”
    在锅炉工地上，记者看见波兰专家正在同越南工人一起奔忙着。即使烈日当空，但是专家和工人仍在高空架上紧张地工作。他们的背心湿透了汗水。八个月来日夜奋战的结果，他们把工程的进度加速了30％，争取新锅炉能够提前在明年1月完成，以便早日投入生产，支援正在一日千里地发展的工业生产建设。
    五年来的这一切巨大变化和惊人的成就，都闪耀着新时代的光芒。但是，更能反映这个新时代的是人的生活的变化。记者访问了老电工老孝。他在厂里干了二十多年活。工厂经历的两个时代的变化在他的脑子里留下不可磨灭的印象。他说：“法国人统治时期，工人像牛马一样地工作。那时，一个工人每天干十二个小时的活，下班还要无偿地给厂主抹地板、打扫房间。运煤工人中午边运煤边吃着沾满泥土的饭团，中午累了就在煤堆上躺一躺。工人们月底发薪，还了债，回到家里，老婆孩子还是照样挨饥受饿，终年穿不上一件新衣裳。多少人就这样年复一年地度过了痛苦不堪的日子。”
      “更残酷的是法国殖民者根本不讲劳动安全。”老孝沉痛地告诉我一个悲惨的故事。“二十年前，那时不像今天这样用输送带把煤送上几丈高的煤塔，而是用人力把煤从地面送上去。可是在塔口四周却没有安上栏杆。一个晚上，工人老笃来回运煤十多趟，弄得精疲力尽，就在这时，他刚把煤倒下去，疲惫的身体也失去了平衡，脚步往前一跨，连煤带人掉进那深不见底的塔里去，永远出不来了。遗下了三个孤苦无依的小孩……。”
    “这只是法国殖民者管理时期的二百多起事故中的一起。我们这辈人对于这些事故，是怎么也忘不了的。只有记住旧的痛苦，才能更爱新的生活。”老工人讲完这些旧日的伤心事，把话题转到今天的生活。他说：“我现在每月的收入不仅全家够用，而且还略有盈余。过去入不敷出，全家一顿饿一顿饱，现在保证了顿顿饱。孩子们也有套像样的衣裳了。”老人的脸颊上浮现出一抹笑容。他接着说：“现在，我的儿子有的上中学，有的在厂里当技工。我自己去年摘了文盲帽，现在夜校念小学三年级。更值得骄傲的是，过去法国人不肯把透平机的道理教给我，可是现在我在业余技术班里学会了。”这个饱经风霜的老电工最后说：“旧的日子不再回头了，新的日子正在越过越好。”
