Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The vast wheat fields in the Yellow River and Huai River basins have already headed. The wheat seedlings are lush and tall, rolling with the wind, an endless green sea. Everywhere presents a scene of a bumper harvest. At present, various localities are strengthening the late-stage management of wheat fields and are actively preparing for wheat harvesting to welcome a summer bumper harvest even greater than last year.

Winter wheat in the provinces of South China, including Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, has been harvested, with yields generally higher than last year. Winter wheat in provinces south of the Yellow River, except for the Shaanxi-Gansu Plateau, has generally headed, and winter wheat north of the Yellow River has also entered the stages of booting and heading. Most of the wheat in the Yangtze River basin, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces, is currently flowering and filling. According to reports from various localities to the Ministry of Agriculture, whether in major wheat-producing areas or non-major wheat-producing areas, the nation's more than 330 million mu of winter wheat is growing better than last year. If there are no particularly severe and irresistible natural disasters by maturity, a greater increase in production than last year will be generally achieved. This possibility of increased production is mainly reflected in the fact that the proportion of first-class and second-class seedlings in various regions occupies an absolute advantage. According to statistics from six provinces including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, the better-growing first-class and second-class seedlings account for more than 80%, with the number of effective ears per mu generally ranging from 400,000 to more than 800,000; the relatively poor-growing third-class seedlings account for about 20%. At the same time, according to reports from various localities, many of this year's third-class seedlings are even better than last year's first-class seedlings.

The reason why winter wheat is growing better than last year is mainly due to the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year. Whether it was deep plowing, fertilization, and close planting during autumn sowing, or subsequent field management, it was done more carefully and better than last year, and the "Eight-Character Charter" was implemented better. Moreover, more than 80% are improved varieties. In order to achieve high and abundant yields, the wheat-producing areas have also specially managed many large-area wheat high-yield fields and high-yield plots. According to statistics from ten provinces and cities including Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Hubei, Sichuan, and Beijing, the area of high-yield land accounts for about 30% of the country's wheat planting area. The wheat in these specially cultivated large-area high-yield fields grows even better than ordinary wheat fields. This will also be an important factor in this year's bumper wheat harvest.

Now, except for a few plateau mountain areas, the late frost period has passed. At present, in the late-stage management of wheat fields in various localities, in addition to paying attention to ensuring that the necessary water and fertilizer are met for the late growth and filling of wheat, they are concentrating on preventing the spread of rust and preventing lodging. In order to defend this bumper harvest, the teams in charge of wheat field management in various people's communes and production teams are using all methods to enhance the wheat's ability to resist rust and lodging. Wheat experts and scientific and technical personnel in various places are also assisting farmers in rural areas under the leadership of the Party.

At the same time, various localities and people's communes are repairing and supplementing agricultural tools for the summer harvest. A large number of iron and wood workers have been concentrated and are producing large quantities of sickles, rapid wheat harvesters, wheat carts, and other tools. They are preparing to welcome the first bumper wheat harvest since communization. (Picture attached)

### 麦苗茂密　麦浪翻滚  冬麦区一片丰收景象

    麦苗茂密　麦浪翻滚
    冬麦区一片丰收景象
    已收的普遍比去年增产未收的正在加强后期管理
    新华社30日讯　黄淮流域各地的广大麦田已经抽穗。麦苗茂密高大，随风翻浪，绿海无边。到处呈现出一片丰收的景象。现在各地正加强麦田的后期管理，并积极作收麦的准备，迎接一次比去年更大的夏季大丰收。
    华南福建、广东、广西、云南等省区的冬小麦已经收获，普遍比去年增产。黄河以南各省冬小麦除陕甘高原外已经普遍抽穗，黄河以北的冬小麦也进入了孕穗、抽穗阶段。长江流域的江苏、浙江、江西、湖北、四川等省的大部分小麦正在扬花灌浆。根据各地向农业部的汇报，不论主要产麦区和非主要产麦区，全国三亿三千多万亩冬小麦都长得比去年好，如果到成熟期没有特大的不可抗拒的自然灾害，将普遍获得比去年更大的增产。这种增产的可能性主要表现在各地小麦的一类苗和二类苗的比重占绝对优势。据河南、山东、河北、江苏、陕西和山西等六个省的统计，生长较好的一、二类苗约占80％以上，每亩有效穗数一般有四十万株到八十万株以上；生长较差的三类苗约占20％左右。同时据各地反映，今年有不少三类苗比去年的一类苗还好。
    冬小麦比去年长得好，主要是有去年大跃进的经验，无论去秋种麦时深耕、施肥、密植和以后的田间管理，都作得比去年又细又好，“八字宪法”贯彻得更好。而且80％以上都是良种。为了实现高额丰产，各产麦区还特别经营了许多大面积小麦丰产田和丰产方。仅据河北、河南、山西、湖北、四川和北京等十个省市的统计，丰产地的面积就占全国小麦播种面积的30％左右。这些特别加工培植的大面积丰产地的小麦比一般麦田长得还要好。这也将成为今年小麦大丰收的一个重要因素。
    现在除少数高原山区外，晚霜期已经过去了。现在各地对麦田的后期管理，除注意保证满足小麦后期生长和灌浆的必要水肥以外，正集中注意于防止锈病蔓延和防止倒伏两个大问题上。为保卫这次大丰收，各人民公社各生产队的专管麦田管理的队伍，正使用一切办法增强小麦的抗锈病、抗倒伏的能力。各地的小麦专家和科学技术人员，也在党的领导下，在农村中协助农民作战。
  同时，各地各人民公社都在修检补充夏收的农具。集中了大批铁木工人，正在大批打制镰刀、快速割麦机、运麦小车等工具。准备迎接公社化以后的第一次小麦大丰收。（附图片）
