    Workshop Security Guard
    In the workshop, on the sports field, and in the workers' dormitories, one often sees a vibrant young man working. He seems to be familiar with everyone, and people greet him warmly when they see him. This young man is Comrade Ji Ying, the security guard of the stamping workshop at the Luoyang Tractor Factory.
    In April 1958, Comrade Ji Ying was transferred to the workshop to work in security. At that time, the task was new and the work unfamiliar. What to do? The leading comrades of the Party told him to safeguard production through production. Comrade Ji Ying followed the Party's instructions and, after arriving at the workshop, worked alongside the workers, learning technology, understanding operating procedures, and at the same time, caring about the workers' lives and helping everyone solve various difficulties in work and life. If someone was sick, he would go to offer his condolences; if a couple quarreled, he would go to mediate. In this way, he quickly made friends with everyone. Workers proactively reported situations to him and jointly carried out security work. For example, workers reported to him that the overhead crane safety system was chaotic, and some workers operated the crane without the driver's permission, which could easily lead to personal injury accidents. After understanding this, he immediately found the mechanic, safety officer, and power engineer to jointly establish a safety system for using the overhead crane, and there have been no problems since.
    In the factory, Comrade Ji Ying actively did everything that was beneficial to production, whether it was big or small. When there was no water to drink on the Sunday night shift, he would go to fetch water; when letters arrived and no one delivered them, he would deliver them to the workers; when newspapers arrived and no one delivered them, he would deliver them to each work section. Caring for everyone in terms of labor, thought, and life, everyone also cared for him and helped him, making security work a matter of concern for everyone; everyone came to do security work. Since Comrade Ji Ying came to the workshop, under the correct leadership of the workshop Party branch, he has closely relied on the broad masses, focusing on the political movements and production tasks of each period, and using various forms such as big-character posters, cartoons, and poems to strengthen the education of employees on safe production. In this way, the revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses of workers has been raised, safety movements have been actively carried out, major accidents have been avoided, and the smooth progress of production has been ensured.

    车间保卫员
    在车间里、运动场上、职工宿舍中，经常看到一个朝气蓬勃的青年在工作着。他好像和每个人都很熟悉，大家见了他亲切地向他打招呼。这位青年就是洛阳拖拉机厂冲压车间的保卫员吉英同志。
    1958年4月，吉英同志调到车间作保卫工作，当时任务新、业务生，怎办呢？党的领导同志告诉他到生产中去保卫生产。吉英同志遵照党的指示，到车间后便和工人们一起劳动，学习技术，了解操作规程，同时关心工人的生活，帮助大家解决工作上生活上的各种困难。谁生病了，他就去慰问，谁家夫妻吵架，他就去调解。这样，他很快就和大家交上了朋友。工人主动向他反映情况，共同进行保卫工作。如在劳动中工人向他反映天车安全制度混乱，有的工人不经司机允许随便开天车，容易发生人身事故。他了解后，马上找到机械师、安全员和动力师共同订立了使用天车的安全制度，至今一直未发生过问题。
    吉英同志在厂里不管是大事、小事，只要是对生产有利的事，他都积极地去干。星期天夜班没有水喝，他就去挑水；信来了没人送，他就分头送给工人；报纸来了没人送，他就给各工部送去。从劳动上、思想上、生活上关心大家，大家也都关心他，帮助他，使保卫工作成为人人都关心的事；大家都来作保卫工作。吉英同志到车间以来，在车间党支部的正确领导下，紧紧依靠广大群众围绕每个时期的政治运动和生产任务，利用大字报、漫画、诗歌等各种形式，对职工加强了安全生产的教育。这样，提高了广大职工的革命警惕性，积极开展安全运动，避免了重大事故的发生，保证了生产的顺利进行。
