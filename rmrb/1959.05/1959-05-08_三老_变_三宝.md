Representative Zhu Zaodi said: Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill is a "three olds" factory, meaning old people, old factory, and old machines. But old people have more experience, old factories have great potential, and old machines can be innovated. After the "Mechanical Rectification" and "Celebrating the 40th Birthday of Machines" rectification, the forty-year-old machines "rejuvenated," and the "three olds" transformed into "three treasures."

Fellow representatives:
    I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and suggest that the congress approve them.
    Nineteen fifty-eight was a year of the Great Leap Forward for the Chinese people in building socialism. In this leap forward era, the textile industry, like other industries, also achieved a great leap forward. Now, I would like to report to everyone on the situation of the Great Leap Forward in Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill in Wuhan City.
    Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill is a "three olds" factory, meaning old people, old factory, and old machines. The equipment conditions are relatively poor, but under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, all the factory's employees have brought into play the spirit of hard work and ingenuity, transforming the "three olds" into "three treasures." Without increasing equipment, production has achieved a tremendous leap forward, as illustrated by the following figures:
    In 1958, the total output value fulfilled 106.35 percent of the plan, an increase of 31.97 percent compared to 1957.
    In 1958, cotton yarn fulfilled 105.22 percent of the state plan, an increase of 32.93 percent compared to 1957.
    In 1958, cotton cloth fulfilled 105.22 percent of the state plan, an increase of 34.97 percent compared to 1957.
    In 1958, profits fulfilled 116.96 percent of the state plan, an increase of 176.58 percent compared to 1957.
    Our factory has 100,000 spindles. In 1958, each spindle produced more than one piece of yarn, realizing the slogan of "one spindle, one piece of yarn." In addition to yarn and cloth, our primary products, we also built two Western-style blast furnaces and a velvet blanket factory in 1958. We produced more than 760 tons of iron, more than 208 tons of steel, and 17,935 various patterned velvet blankets.
    In addition, we successfully experimented with high-grade yarn (250 count), corduroy, sand cloth, double-layer cloth, wide-width cloth, linen cloth, etc. Sand cloth, for example, has already been formally put into production this year. At the same time, we also produced 152 lathes, all-metal needle cloth, drop wires, heddles, combs, and other products.
    Production development has improved so quickly; this is unprecedented in our factory's history. In the first quarter of this year, we achieved an even greater and newer leap forward, also without increasing any equipment. Cotton yarn production increased by 25.95 percent compared to the same period in 1958, cotton cloth production increased by 21.56 percent compared to the same period in 1958, and total output value increased by 28.7 percent. Together with the people of the whole country, we are advancing wave upon wave, and production is advancing "step by step, day by day."
    Our employees not only work hard but also cleverly, and have also achieved great success in technological innovation. In 1958, according to incomplete statistics, there were more than 700 innovation proposals, of which more than 400 have been successfully or basically successfully tested, which is much more than in 1957. Especially after the "double anti" campaign in 1958, the successful trial spinning of high-grade yarn led everyone to break superstitions, liberate their thinking, make great innovation proposals, and carry out new technology experiments. It was truly a case of everyone contributing ideas and everyone using their brains. For example, the successful experiments with linen cloth, sand cloth, and wide-width cloth; the automation of fine yarn cleaning tools; and the double-headed steel wire, etc. After August and September 1958, the drive for high speed made technological innovation even more prominent. In fine yarn operation, in order to adapt to the high-speed requirements, the new working methods of "five grabs" (grab floating ends, grab jumping tubes, grab changing roving, grab the ends of the car and flute tube, grab preparations before making large yarns), "three discards" (discarding the broken ends connected to the car head and the suction cotton box, discarding the broken ends in the middle of the flute tube, discarding and connecting simple ends, discard first and connect first), and "four grasps" (grasp the white flowers in the cotton box, grasp the patrol time, grasp the compartmentalization of the room tower, grasp the cleanliness work) were implemented. The speed of the main yarn count of 21s was increased from about 240 rpm to about 300 rpm. In the great competition, the entire staff of our factory created a new form of contest, using the machines as arenas to compete for heroes and good men, making their enthusiasm greater and their technology higher. For example, in fine yarn piecing, few people could originally piece 18 ends, but through competition and mutual learning, they gradually improved, from 18 ends to 20 ends, 22 ends, and 24 ends. Recently, Chen Hanrong, a female fine yarn worker, created a new record of piecing 26 ends per minute, reaching the national advanced level. Unit output breaks targets every day, and a large number of four-high experts and production experts have emerged.
    Through the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we not only know how to spin and weave, but also how to smelt steel and iron. We not only know how to repair, but also how to manufacture. We not only know how to weave cloth, but also how to weave velvet blankets and corduroy and sand cloth. With the development of the all-rounder movement, car operators not only know how to operate the car but also basically know how to repair the car. There are many new people and new things, and I will not list them all here.
    The above is a simple account of the Great Leap Forward in our factory in 1958. This year, the employees of our factory have again warmly responded to the Party's call and are vigorously carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centering on technological revolution, creating an even greater and newer leap forward situation. In the first quarter, we completed and overfulfilled the state plan.
    Comrades! We have been able to achieve such a great leap forward in 1958 because of the correct leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and the Textile Party Committee; because we have broken superstitions and liberated our thinking through rectification; especially because the Party Committee has conscientiously implemented the principle of "Party leadership, politics in command, and mass movement." In the past, our production could not catch up with advanced regions and advanced factories because we thought we were a "three olds" factory, and that we couldn't catch up with advanced factories due to the limitations of conditions. From top to bottom, we had this idea of "theory of conditions," only seeing the objective and not striving from the subjective. Of course, we could not make progress. But through the rectification movement, we have raised our thinking and changed our views. Everyone believes that "old people have more experience, old factories have great potential, and old machines can be innovated." Because of strengthening the Party's leadership, going through rectification, putting politics in command, and mobilizing and relying on the masses in all our work, what we thought of as the "three olds" can be transformed into "three treasures." Our factory's machines have 40 years of production history. Originally, it was decided to replace them with new ones, but in order to support the new factories, we later decided not to replace them. Not only will we not replace them, but we will use these old machines to produce more and better products to meet the needs of the people's lives. In the surging tide of competition, we launched a "mechanical rectification." For example, after increasing the speed of the fine yarn, there were many broken ends, up to more than 1,200 broken ends. Among them, mechanical broken ends due to the old machines accounted for 70 percent. So, we launched an activity to "celebrate the birthday of the machines," carrying out a large-scale rectification of the mechanical state, finding out the "three winds" and "five airs" of the machines. This "machine birthday celebration" activity, under the leadership of the Party, established a "Machine Birthday Celebration Preparatory Committee" composed of 13 veteran workers. "Celebrating the 40th Birthday of Machines" mobilized everyone to contribute ideas and do things to rectify the mechanical state, making the 40-year-old machines younger and younger, "rejuvenating." Every comrade actively participated in this activity and seriously prepared gifts for the "birthday celebration." In this way, everyone showed their skills and worked hard to rectify more than 40 projects. The number of broken ends was greatly reduced, and good results were achieved in production. The mixed broken ends of the No. 10 car in the South Yard decreased from the original 589 to 84, and the mechanical broken ends decreased from 305 to 5.2. The North Yard also created new achievements on the No. 20 car, decreasing from the original 680 mixed broken ends to 89, and the mechanical broken ends decreased from 448 to 15.
    This shows that to firmly rely on the Party's leadership, put politics in command, and follow the mass line, our work will be victorious. We are not satisfied with the victories we have already achieved. Now, the employees of our factory are holding high the red flag and advancing victoriously, seizing the key, deeply carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centering on technological revolution, resolutely implementing the policy of "the whole country as one chessboard," quickly launching a "three highs" (high output, high quality, high labor productivity) and "ten comparisons" (comparing output, comparing output value, comparing cost, comparing profit, comparing labor productivity, comparing equipment utilization rate, comparing safety, comparing overall perspective and collaboration perspective, comparing style - both daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and being practical) red flag competition movement, to offer gifts to "May Day" and "July 1st" with the practical action of completing and overfulfilling the state plan for the second quarter in a greater, better, and more comprehensive way!

　　“三老”变“三宝”
　　朱早弟代表说：武昌第一纱厂是个“三老”工厂，即人老、厂老、机器老。但人老经验多，厂老潜力大，机器老能革新。经过为“机械整风”“祝机器四十大寿”大整顿后，四十年的老机器“返老还童”，“三老”变成了“三宝”各位代表：
    我衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告及李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，建议大会予以通过。
    一九五八年是我国人民建设社会主义大跃进的一年。在这个跃进的年代里，纺织工业和其他工业一样，也取得了很大跃进。现在我把武汉市武昌第一纱厂大跃进以来的情况向大家汇报一下。
    武昌第一纱厂是个“三老”工厂，即人老、厂老、机器老，设备条件是比较差的，但是在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，全厂职工发挥了苦干与巧干的精神，变“三老”为“三宝”，在没有增加设备的情况下生产得到了巨大跃进，从以下几个数字可以说明：
    一九五八年总产值完成百分之一百零六点三五，比一九五七年增加了百分之三十一点九七。
    一九五八年棉纱完成国家计划百分之一百零五点二二，比一九五七年增加了百分之三十二点九三。
    一九五八年棉布完成国家计划百分之一百零五点二二，比一九五七年增加了百分之三十四点九七。
    一九五八年利润完成国家计划百分之一百一十六点九六，比一九五七年增加了一百七十六点五八。
    我厂有十万纱锭，一九五八年一个锭子生产了一件多纱，实现了“一个锭子一件纱”的口号。除纱布主要产品外，一九五八年还建设了两座洋高炉，办了一个绒毯场。生产了七百六十多吨铁，二百零八吨多钢，以及各种花色品种绒毯一万七千九百三十五条。
    此外，还试验成功了高级纱（二百五十支）、灯芯绒、沙发布、双层布、宽幅布、麻纱布等，像沙发布今年已正式投入生产，同时还生产了车床一百五十二台，全金属针布、仃经片、综、扣等产品。
    生产发展提高得这样快，这是我们工厂过去历来未有的事情。今年第一季度，我们又取得了更大更新的跃进，同样是在没有增加什么设备的情况下取得的。棉纱产量比一九五八年同期增长百分之二十五点九五，棉布产量比一九五八年同期增长百分之二十一点五六，总产值增长了百分之二十八点七。我们同全国人民一道，正在一浪赶一浪，生产是“步步高，日日新”的前进着。
    我们职工群众不仅苦干而又巧干，在技术革新方面也取得很大成绩。一九五八年全年革新项目，据不完全统计，革新建议有七百多件，其中有四百多件已试验成功或基本成功，比一九五七年多得多。特别是一九五八年“双反”以后，试纺高级纱成功，大家破除了迷信，解放了思想，大提革新建议，大搞新技术试验，真是人人献计，个个动脑。如上面说的麻纱布、沙发布、宽幅布等试验成功、细纱清洁工具搞自动化、钢丝搞双龙头等等。一九五八年八、九月后，大搞高速，技术革新更为突出，在细纱操作上，为了适应高速要求，贯彻了“五抢”（抢飘头，抢跳管，抢换粗纱，抢车尾、笛管两头，抢做大纱前准备工作）、三丢（丢接车头及靠吸棉风箱的断头，丢笛管中间的断头，丢接简单头，先丢先接）、四抓（抓棉箱白花、抓紧巡回时间，抓紧做好室塔分段，抓紧做好整洁工作）的新工作法，主要纱支二十一支的速度由二百四十转提高到三百转左右。我厂全体职工在大竞赛中，创造了一个比武打擂的新形式，把机器当擂台，争英雄、比好汉，这样干劲越比越大，技术越比越高。比方细纱接头，原来接十八根的人很少，通过比武，互相学习，步步提高，由十八根到二十根，二十二根，二十四根，最近细纱女工陈汉荣同志创造了一分钟接头二十六根的新纪录，达到全国先进水平。单位产量日日突破指标，四高能手和生产能手大量涌现。
    通过一九五八年的大跃进，我们不仅会纺纱织布，还会炼钢炼铁，不仅会修理，还会制造，不仅会织布，还会织绒毯、灯芯绒、沙发布；多面手运动的开展，值车工不仅会值车，同时基本上还会修车。新人新事多得很，在此不一一列举了。
    上面所讲的是我厂一九五八年大跃进的简单情况。今年我厂职工群众又热烈的响应了党的号召，轰轰烈烈地开展了以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，出现了一个更大更新的跃进局面，第一季度我们完成和超额完成了国家计划。
    同志们！我们能够取得一九五八年这样的大跃进，是由于中共武汉市委和纺织党委的正确领导；由于通过了整风，我们破除了迷信，解放了思想；特别是党委认真贯彻了“党的领导，政治挂帅，群众运动”这条原则。过去我们的生产赶不上先进地区和先进工厂，认为我们是“三老”工厂，赶不上先进厂是受了条件的限制，从上到下都有这种“唯条件论”的思想，只看到客观，不从主观上去努力，当然是不能进步。但是通过了整风运动，提高了思想，转变了看法，大家认为，“人老经验多，厂老潜力大，机器老能革新”。由于加强党的领导，通过整风，政治挂了帅，各项工作都发动了群众依靠了群众，过去所认为的“三老”，就能变成“三宝”。我们厂的机器都有四十年的生产历史，原来决定要换新的，为了支援新厂，后来决定不换。不但不换，还要用这些老机器生产出更多更好的产品来满足人民生活的需要。在掀起轰轰烈烈的竞赛高潮中，我们就为“机械整风”。比方细纱在提高车速以后断头很大，最高达到一千二百多根断头，其中因机器陈旧的机械断头占百分之七十，于是我们就来一个向“机器祝寿”的活动开展大整机械状态，找出机械上的“三风”“五气”。这个“机器祝寿”的活动，在党的领导下，由十三位老工人成立了一个“机器祝寿大会筹备委员会”，“祝机器四十大寿”发动大家向机器送礼，组织大家人人动脑，个个动手，为整顿机械状态出好主意，做好事情，叫四十年的老机器越活越年轻，“返老还童”。每个同志都积极投入了这个活动，认真地为“祝寿”大会准备礼物。这样，大家各显神通，大干特干，整顿了四十多个项目，断头大大降低，生产上收到良好的效果。南场十号车混合断头由原来五百八十九根降到八十四根，机械断头由三百零五根降到五点二根。北场也在二十号车上创造出新的成绩，由原来混合断头六百八十根降到八十九根，机械断头由四百四十八根降到十五根。
    由此说明，要紧紧依靠党的领导，政治挂帅，走群众路线，我们的工作就会取得胜利。我们并不满足既得的胜利，现在我厂职工正在高举红旗乘胜前进，抓住关键，深入开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，迅速掀起“三高”（产量高、质量高、劳动生产率高）“十比”（比产量、比产值、比成本、比利润、比劳动生产率、比设备利用率、比安全、比全面观点和协作观点、比作风——既敢想、敢说、敢干，又踏踏实实）的红旗竞赛运动，以更多更好更全面的完成和超额完成第二季度国家计划的实际行动向“五一”和“七一”献礼！
