Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th May: The steel warriors of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have launched a more enthusiastic production increase and economy drive since the beginning of Red May. In the first week, the production levels of the company's blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, coke ovens, and mines have all risen comprehensively. Compared with April's average daily output:
	Daily pig iron production increased by 1,024 tons
	Daily steel production increased by 867 tons
	Daily coke production increased by 865 tons
	Daily sintered ore production increased by 510 tons

Before the new competition was launched, the steelmaking, ironmaking, and rolling systems of the entire company successively held cadre meetings and general staff meetings to make preparations. Then, each furnace, each shift, and each group formulated plans, proposed measures and guarantees, and challenged each other. The workers of the nine open-hearth furnaces in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant competed with each other to strive for advancement. The factory's red banner furnace—No. 6 open-hearth furnace—first issued a challenge to No. 4 furnace. These two open-hearth furnaces have long been old rivals in competition. No. 6 open-hearth furnace had consistently led in the first quarter of this year, but was overtaken by No. 4 open-hearth furnace in April. Now, this open-hearth furnace is regrouping and competing again, determined to produce six more furnaces of steel than planned in Red May. The workers of No. 4 open-hearth furnace also guaranteed to shorten the smelting time by one hour compared to the state plan. The workers of the Ironmaking Plant, based on the key issues in blast furnace production, have successively implemented more than 300 technical innovations, resulting in the continuous creation of new high-yield records. No. 9 blast furnace and No. 3 blast furnace are running neck and neck, and their utilization coefficients in the first five days both jumped to 2.135, receiving congratulations from the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The workers of the No. 1 and No. 2 Steelmaking Plants and the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces have recently implemented more than 800 major technical innovations, solving many long-term problems in production. The workers of No. 14 open-hearth furnace in the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant summed up the experiences and lessons from production in April, and worked together to shorten the time of each process. On May 1st, they produced a heat of fast-smelting steel in five hours and twenty minutes, creating a new national record for fast-smelting steel in large open-hearth furnaces. The workers of the mining, sintering, coking, refractory materials, hydropower, transportation, and basic construction departments also took measures to cooperate closely. Therefore, in the first seven days of May, five blast furnaces and eleven open-hearth furnaces in the entire company overfulfilled the state plan for this week.

    红五月头七天钢花铁水映红了天
    鞍钢日产量全面上升
    平均日产量同四月份比较
    生铁多产1024吨
    钢多产867吨
    焦炭多产865吨
    烧结矿多产510吨
    新华社鞍山10日电　鞍山钢铁公司的钢铁战士，一进入红五月就更加热烈地展开增产节约竞赛。在第一周里，全公司的高炉、平炉、轧钢机、炼焦炉、矿山的生产水平全面上升；平均日产量同4月份比较：每天生铁多产一千○二十四吨，钢多产八百六十七吨，钢材多产三十吨，焦炭多产八百六十五吨，烧结矿多产五百一十吨。
    在新的竞赛开展之前，全公司炼钢、炼铁、轧钢系统都先后召开了干部会议和全体职工大会，作好准备。接着，各炉各班各组都订出了计划，纷纷提措施、提保证，互相挑战应战。第一炼钢厂九座平炉的职工，互相竞赛，力争先进。全厂的红旗炉——六号平炉首先把挑战书下到四号炉。这两座平炉早就是竞赛的老对手。六号平炉在今年第一季度始终领先，4月份却被四号平炉赶过。现在这座平炉又重整旗鼓，再比高低，决心在红五月里比计划多产六炉钢。四号平炉职工也保证把熔炼时间比国家计划缩短一小时。炼铁厂的职工根据高炉生产中的关键问题，先后实现了三百多项技术革新，结果连创高产新纪录。九号高炉和三号高炉并驾齐驱，头五天的利用系数双双跃进到二·一三五，得到了中共辽宁省委的祝贺。第一、第二炼钢厂和五座大型固定式平炉的职工，近来实现了较大的技术革新八百多项，解决了生产中许多长期未能解决的问题。第二炼钢厂十四号平炉的职工，总结了4月份生产中的经验教训，齐心合力缩短每一道工序的时间，在5月1日就以五小时二十分钟炼出一炉快速炼钢，创造了全国大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。矿山、烧结、炼焦、耐火材料、水电、运输、基本建设等部门的职工，也采取措施密切配合。因此，全公司在5月份的头七天里，有五座高炉和十一座平炉超额完成了这一周的国家计划。
