Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 20th. The 10th session of the Vietnamese National Assembly opened here this morning. The session is scheduled to last about eight days. A total of 202 delegates attended the meeting.

President Ho Chi Minh attended today's meeting.

Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, first delivered a report on the work of the Standing Committee. Regarding the work of amending the Constitution, he said that the Standing Committee of the National Assembly has called on the whole people to enthusiastically participate in the discussion of amending the Constitution. The National Assembly's Constitution Amendment Committee is vigorously collecting opinions from the broad masses of people on the draft Constitution. The draft Constitution, which has been further supplemented and revised based on the opinions of the broad masses of people, will be submitted to another session of the National Assembly for discussion and adoption.

The Vietnamese National Assembly also heard this morning a report by Deputy Prime Minister Truong Chinh on the issue of the Vietnamese agricultural cooperativization movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 20th. Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered a report entitled "Resolutely Lead Our Northern Countryside Towards Socialism Through the Path of Agricultural Cooperativization" at the 10th session of the Vietnamese National Assembly today. In his report, he talked about the current situation in the northern countryside of Vietnam, the necessity of realizing agricultural cooperativization, and the specific policies of the Vietnamese Labor Party in this regard.

Truong Chinh said: We are fighting for the unification of the country and for carrying out the socialist revolution in the North. In the socialist revolution, we attach great importance to the work of socialist transformation of non-socialist economic components. Truong Chinh then emphasized: In the entire socialist transformation work in northern Vietnam at present, agricultural cooperativization is a major link. If agricultural cooperativization is done well, it will create favorable conditions for other aspects of transformation work and even all our work.

After reviewing the history of democratic reforms and mutual aid cooperation in the northern countryside of Vietnam, Truong Chinh pointed out that at present, in the northern countryside of Vietnam, the work exchange and cooperation movement is developing rapidly, and a mass movement has taken shape. He said that by April 1959, there were already 7,000 agricultural cooperatives in northern Vietnam, owning about 8% of the total number of peasant households; there were about 250,000 work exchange teams, owning nearly 70% of the total number of peasant households. Fishermen are also actively organizing. At present, there are already 102 fishery cooperatives in northern Vietnam.

Truong Chinh said that while developing agricultural production cooperatives, credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives are also developing in many places. By the end of 1958, there were already 204 supply and marketing cooperatives and 3,000 credit cooperatives. In addition, there are 15 state-owned farms and 33 military reclamation farms.

Truong Chinh pointed out that the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in northern Vietnam in 1958 is an important change in the northern countryside of Vietnam moving in the direction of socialism. It shows that under the correct leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, the revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm of the peasants have been greatly promoted. He also pointed out that the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in communist construction, China's Great Leap Forward, and the rapid development of other socialist countries have also influenced the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in northern Vietnam.

Truong Chinh then talked about the different attitudes taken by various strata of the Vietnamese countryside towards agricultural cooperativization, pointing out that these different attitudes reflect the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads and the struggle between socialist forces and anti-socialist forces in the northern countryside of Vietnam. Socialist factors are developing vigorously; while capitalist factors have been restricted and repelled. Although the question of "who will win" has not yet been resolved in the northern countryside of Vietnam, it will surely be resolved in a direction favorable to socialism.

Truong Chinh emphasized in his report the important position of agricultural cooperativization in the entire socialist transformation and socialist construction cause in northern Vietnam, as well as its great significance for consolidating North Vietnam and realizing national unification. He called on the entire party and people to mobilize and join this "great revolutionary movement."

Truong Chinh emphasized the importance of strengthening specific leadership over the agricultural cooperativization movement. He pointed out that in carrying out this movement, special attention must be paid to ideological work, vigorously strengthening political and ideological education for peasants, and strengthening the education of the class line for the entire party and all cadres.

Truong Chinh pointed out that the class line of the Vietnamese Labor Party in the current agricultural cooperativization movement is: "Resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants, closely unite with middle peasants, restrict and even eliminate the economic exploitation of rich peasants, transform the thinking of rich peasants, prevent landlords from raising their heads, continue to give landlords a way out to carry out labor reform and become new people, and resolutely guide peasants onto the road of agricultural cooperativization to enter socialism."

Truong Chinh said that the current policy of agricultural cooperativization in northern Vietnam is: "Actively lead, advance steadily; make overall plans, adapt to local conditions; good, stable, and economical." He also pointed out that "the principles of establishing cooperatives are: voluntary, mutual benefit, and democratic management."

Truong Chinh said that generally speaking, the agricultural cooperativization movement should move from lower forms to higher forms and go through three steps: from work exchange teams to elementary cooperatives, and then to advanced cooperatives. However, when the agricultural cooperativization movement has entered a climax, it can go through two steps instead of necessarily following three steps.

When talking about the issue of agricultural cooperativization in the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam, Truong Chinh said that the democratic reforms in the mountainous areas have not yet been fully completed. Therefore, in addition to the townships that have already mobilized the masses to complete land reform, which must currently concentrate their efforts on carrying out the agricultural cooperativization movement like the plain areas, the general task of other townships at present is to develop the agricultural cooperativization movement, develop production, and at the same time complete the democratic reforms.

Truong Chinh finally said, "Resolutely leading our northern countryside towards socialism through the path of agricultural cooperativization is a great revolutionary task for our entire party and all our people. Under the leadership of the Party and the government headed by President Ho, we will surely be able to gloriously complete this great task."

    长征在越南国会第十次会议上指出
    当前革命任务为开展农业合作化运动
    号召全党全民动员起来投入这一运动使北方农村走向社会主义
    新华社河内20日电　越南国会第十次会议今天上午在这里开幕。会期预定为八天左右。出席会议的代表共二百零二名。
    胡志明主席出席了今天的会议。
    越南国会常务委员会委员长孙德胜首先在会上作了关于常务委员会工作的报告。关于修改宪法的工作，他说，国会常务委员会已经号召全民热烈参加讨论修改宪法的工作，国会宪法修改委员会正在大力收集广大人民对宪法草案的意见，根据广大人民的意见再度补充修改的宪法草案，将提交另一次国会会议讨论通过。
    越南国会今天上午还听取了长征副总理所作的关于越南农业合作化运动问题的报告。
    新华社河内20日电　越南劳动党中央政治局委员、越南民主共和国副总理长征今天在越南国会第十次会议上作了题为“坚决使我国北方农村通过农业合作化的道路走向社会主义”的报告。他在报告中谈到了越南北方农村目前的情况，实现农业合作化的必要性，以及越南劳动党在这方面的具体政策。
    长征说：我们正在为统一国家和在北方进行社会主义革命而斗争。在社会主义革命中，我们非常重视对非社会主义经济成分进行社会主义改造的工作。长征接着强调说：在越南北方目前的整个社会主义改造工作中，农业合作化是一个主要的环节。农业合作化搞好了，也就为其他方面的改造工作以至我们的全部工作创造了有利的条件。
    长征在回顾了越南北方农村实行民主改革和互助合作的历史以后指出，目前在越南北方农村中，变工合作运动正在迅速发展，已经形成了群众性的运动。他说，到1959年4月止，越南北方已经有七千个农业合作社，它们所拥有的农户约占农户总数的8％；约有二十五万个变工组，它们拥有的农户约占农户总数的近70％。渔民也积极组织起来。目前，越南北方已经有一百零二个渔业合作社。
    长征说，在发展农业生产合作社的同时，信贷合作社和供销合作社也在许多地方发展起来。到1958年底，已经有二百零四个供销合作社和三千个信贷合作社。此外，还有十五个国营农场和三十三个军垦农场。
    长征指出，越南北方农业合作化运动在1958年间的迅速发展，是越南北方农村在朝社会主义方向前进中的一个重要变化。它表明，在越南劳动党和政府的正确领导下，农民的革命性和劳动热情大大发扬了。他还指出，苏联在共产主义建设中取得的巨大成就、中国的大跃进以及其它社会主义国家的迅速发展也对越南北方农业合作化运动的发展发生了影响。
    长征接着在谈到越南农村各阶层对农业合作化所采取的不同态度后指出，这些不同的态度反映了越南北方农村中的社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争和社会主义力量同反对社会主义力量两种势力的斗争。社会主义因素正在大力发展；而资本主义因素受到了限制，并被击退。虽然“谁战胜谁”的问题在越南北方的农村中还没有得到解决，但是一定会朝有利于社会主义的方向获得解决。
    长征在报告中强调指出农业合作化在越南北方的整个社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业中的重要地位以及它对巩固北越、实现国家统一的巨大意义。他号召全党全民动员起来，投入这一“巨大的革命运动”。
    长征强调指出加强对农业合作化运动的具体领导的重要性。他指出，在开展这一运动中，必须特别重视思想工作，大力加强对农民的政治思想教育，加强对全党和全体干部的阶级路线的教育。
    长征指出，越南劳动党在当前的农业合作化运动中的阶级路线是：“坚决依靠贫农和下中农，紧密团结中农，限制以至消灭富农的经济剥削，改造富农思想，防止地主抬头，继续给地主以进行劳动改造和成为新人的出路，坚决引导农民走上农业合作化的道路以进入社会主义。”
    长征说，目前越南北方农业合作化的方针是：“积极领导，稳步前进；全面规划，因地制宜；好、稳、省。”他还指出，“建社的原则是：自愿、互利和民主管理。”
    长征说，一般说来，农业合作化运动要从低级形式进入高级形式，并且要经过三个步骤：从变工组到初级合作社，然后到高级合作社。但是，在农业合作化运动已进入高潮的时候，可以经过两个步骤，而不一定非按三个步骤不可。
    长征在谈到越南北方山区的农业合作化问题时说，山区的民主改革还没有全部完成，因此，除了已经发动群众完成土改的乡目前必须同平原地区一样集中力量搞农业合作化运动以外，其它的乡当前的任务总的来说是，发展农业合作化运动、发展生产，同时完成民主改革。
    长征最后说，“坚决使我国北方农村通过农业合作化的道路走向社会主义，是我国全党、全体人民的巨大的革命任务。在以胡主席为首的党和政府的领导下，我们一定能光荣地完成这一巨大任务。”
