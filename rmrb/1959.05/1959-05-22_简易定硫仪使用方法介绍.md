The simplified sulfur analyzer created by the Weifang Second Steel Plant in Shandong Province is used to test the sulfur content of pig iron. This equipment is simple, easy to operate, and the test results are accurate. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry believes that it is worth promoting in various regions. Using this method to test the sulfur content of pig iron, in addition to about half an hour of preparation time, it only takes eight to ten minutes to perform one test item, which improves efficiency nearly seventy times compared to the past use of barium sulfate analysis.

The equipment used in this simplified sulfur determination method is the indigenous sulfur analyzer created by this factory. This equipment has a simple structure and can be manufactured by general steel plants. The equipment, chemicals, and materials used in the simplified sulfur determination method are introduced as follows:

(1) A small oxygen cylinder, or a bicycle tire inner tube filled with oxygen; (2) A washing bottle with a capacity of 500 ml, containing 400 ml of saturated sodium hydroxide solution, the bottle mouth is tightly sealed with a rubber stopper; (3) A drying tower, with calcium chloride in the upper layer and filter cotton or glass wool in the lower layer; (4) An indigenous furnace (furnace depth 30 cm, plane width 20 cm), a small blower or medium-sized bellows, a combustion tube (3 cm in diameter and 60 cm in length) running across the center of the furnace, with both ends extending out of the furnace wall; (5) A titration stand, a titration clamp, a 50 ml brown burette containing a standard iodine solution, a 100 ml measuring cup containing 40 to 50 ml of starch solution; (6) Connect the above-mentioned related equipment with a part of glass tubes and rubber tubes so that oxygen can pass through the washing bottle, drying tower, combustion tube and enter the measuring cup, and fix the rubber tubes of the oxygen tank and the measuring cup with iron clamps respectively. During operation, light the fire in the furnace, then fill it with broken coke, and start blowing air to gradually increase the furnace temperature to 1200 to 1300 degrees Celsius. Before the official test, a blank test should be performed first. The method is: drip a few drops of iodine into the starch solution, then send oxygen for half a minute to make the iodine, starch solution and oxygen become a blue liquid in the measuring cup. Open the rubber stopper at one end of the combustion tube, put the sample (iron filings) into the porcelain dish and put it into the combustion tube, and accurately record the amount of iodine solution in the burette. After three minutes, open the oxygen clamp to let oxygen pass through the washing bottle to remove carbon dioxide, then pass through the drying tower for filtration, and then pass into the combustion tube to combine with sulfur to form sulfur dioxide. Open the other iron clamp to make it pass from the other end of the combustion tube into the measuring cup. At this time, the starch solution will change from blue to white. The operator continues to slowly titrate iodine from the burette into the measuring cup until the blue color no longer turns white, then clamp the rubber tubes of the oxygen tank and the measuring cup again, calculate the amount of iodine consumed, and hook out the porcelain dish. Finally, use the amount of iodine consumed to calculate the sulfur content of the iron.

After this test item is completed, just record the amount of iodine solution in the burette, pour out the starch solution in the measuring cup, pour in a new solution, and you can continue the second test.

    简易定硫仪使用方法介绍
    山东省潍坊第二钢铁厂创造的简易定硫仪，用来化验生铁中的含硫量。这种设备简单，操作容易，化验结果准确。冶金工业部认为值得在各地推广。采用这种方法化验生铁含硫量，除约半小时的准备时间外，每作一个化验项目，只需八分到十分钟，比过去用硫酸钡化验，提高效率近七十倍。
    这种简易定硫法用的设备是这个厂创造的土定硫仪，这种设备结构简单，一般钢铁厂可以制造。现将简易定硫法所使用的设备、药品与材料介绍如下：
    （一）小氧气桶一个，或用自行车轮胎内胎打足氧气；（二）容量五百毫升的洗瓶一只，内装氢氧化钠饱和溶液四百毫升，瓶口用橡皮塞堵严；（三）干燥塔一个，内上层装氯化钙，下层装过滤棉或玻璃丝；（四）土炉一个（炉膛深三十公分，平面宽二十公分），小吹风机或中型风箱一个，一根燃烧管（口径三公分，长六十公分），横贯于炉膛中心，两头通出炉壁外：（五）滴定台，滴定夹各一个，五十毫升棕色滴定管一根，内装碘标准溶液，一百毫升量杯一只，内装四十到五十毫升的淀粉溶液；（六）用玻璃管和胶皮管一部分，将上述有关设备连接起来，可使氧气通过洗瓶、干燥塔、燃烧管进入量杯，并将通氧桶和量杯的胶管分别用铁卡卡住。操作时，将火炉生着，再填上焦炭碎块，开始吹风，使炉温逐渐增高到一千二百度到一千三百度。在正式化验前，应先作一次空白试验，方法是：滴几滴碘在淀粉溶液中，接着送半分钟的氧气，使碘、淀粉溶液和氧在量杯中成为蓝色液体。打开燃烧管一端的橡皮塞，将试样（铁屑）装到瓷盘里放入燃烧管，并将滴定管内之碘溶液数量记准，等三分钟后，将氧气卡打开，使氧通过洗瓶，除去碳酸气，再通过干燥塔过滤，然后通入燃烧管，与硫化合成二氧化硫，将另一个铁卡打开，使其由燃烧管另一端通到量杯内，这时淀粉溶液即会由蓝色变为白色，操作人员即继续由滴定管慢慢的向量杯内滴定碘，直滴到蓝色不再变白为止，然后将通氧气桶和量杯的胶皮管再卡住，算出耗碘量来，并将瓷盘钩出。最后用耗碘量计算铁的含硫量。
    这一个化验项目作完后，只需将滴定管内的碘溶液的数量记下，再将量杯中的淀粉溶液倒出，倒入新的溶液，就可继续作第二次试验。
