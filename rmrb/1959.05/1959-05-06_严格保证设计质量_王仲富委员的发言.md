Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully and heartily agree with and warmly support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

In the short span of over nine years since the liberation of New China, we have achieved tremendous successes on all fronts. The people of the whole country are elated by the continuous victories. The achievements of the past nine years, especially the over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and the establishment of the people's communes, are brilliant, unprecedented, and world-shaking great achievements. They eloquently prove that under the incomparably superior socialist system, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the close unity and enthusiastic and courageous labor of the people of all nationalities across the country, six hundred million hands possess such great power!

It is particularly worth mentioning that people's communes were universally established throughout the country in 1958 based on the demands of the broad masses of peasants. This is a great creation of unparalleled significance in the organization of Chinese society. It will accelerate China's socialist construction; it will accelerate China's transition from socialist society to communist society. This great significance will never be understood or slandered by those imperialists and reactionaries in the world.

Imperialists and all domestic and foreign reactionaries are not reconciled to their failure and do not want to see our motherland embark on the road of prosperity and strength. For many years, they have consistently engaged in despicable and shameless sabotage activities. Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, launched a disgraceful armed rebellion on March 10, and abducted the Dalai Lama, fleeing to India to continue their traitorous activities. I express my immense anger and stern condemnation here for the criminal activities of this small group of traitors and the unreasonable interference of those foreign reactionaries with ulterior motives. Tibet has been an inalienable part of China since ancient times. Suppressing the rebellion of reactionaries in our own territory is China's internal affair. I fully support all the decisions made and all the measures taken by the government in response to this event.

I am an industrial construction design worker. Since liberation, I have been engaged in the peaceful construction of the motherland and have deeply and intimately realized that our design work has achieved tremendous development and progress over the past nine years. At the time of liberation, China's design strength and design level were very weak. In the past few years, from scratch, from small to large, a relatively complete design team has been formed. As Premier Zhou said: "We have been able to design and build some relatively large and technologically complex industrial enterprises ourselves." This is precisely the result of the Party and the government's deep concern and correct leadership of the design work, as well as the help given to us by the socialist brotherly countries headed by the Soviet Union. Design work is an important link in the entire construction undertaking. It is a crucial factor that directly determines whether each construction undertaking meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. An excellent design must not only be technically advanced and economically reasonable, but more importantly, it must be able to fully comply with the country's policies and construction principles. It is a concrete manifestation of the highly technical achievements and highly political ideology combined. Over the years, the Party and the government have frequently given correct instructions on our design work and have repeatedly and promptly corrected the deviations that have occurred in our work. This has played a decisive role in enabling design work to serve the cause of socialist construction to the greatest extent. In this report, Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li Fuchun have once again pointed out a clear direction for our work. We must follow the spirit of the instructions, closely integrate with the broad masses, liberate our thinking, break down superstitions, vigorously carry out the technical revolution and technical innovation movement; practice strict economy in design, strictly guarantee design quality, and make excellent designs that are convenient for construction and conducive to production, on time, in quantity, and in quality, in accordance with the requirements of the national general line.

As a scientific and technical worker, I believe that the most important point is the issue of self-transformation of each of us. In our team of scientific and technological workers, the vast majority of members are intellectuals. Old intellectuals, including myself, need to actively and consciously strive to accelerate transformation in work practice. Premier Zhou correctly pointed out in his report: Cultivating new intellectuals and transforming old intellectuals is a great historical task on the cultural and educational front. We should work hard to study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, get close to the masses and go deep into the masses, regularly participate in physical labor, learn the fine qualities of the working people, improve our political consciousness, and strive to become both red and expert working-class intellectuals as soon as possible.

Our motherland is developing at a speed of a thousand miles a day. Our future tasks are incomparably glorious and incomparably great. We must, with a hundredfold confidence and soaring enthusiasm, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and together with the people of the whole country, unite under the banner of socialism, strive to complete the magnificent national plan for 1959, and strive to build our motherland into a great socialist country with a highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

### 严格保证设计质量  王仲富委员的发言

　　严格保证设计质量
    王仲富委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    对于周总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告，我完全表示衷心的同意和热烈的拥护。
    解放了的新中国，在短短九年多的时间里，在各个事业的战线上，都取得了非常巨大的成绩，全国人民，都为我国一个接一个的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。九年来的成就，尤其如第一个五年计划的超额完成，一九五八年的大跃进，人民公社的建立等光辉灿烂的、史无前例的、震惊世界的伟大成就，雄辩地证明了：在具有无比优越性的社会主义制度下，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在全国各族人民亲密团结和热情勇敢的劳动下，六亿多双手是具有何等伟大的力量啊！
    尤其值得提出的是一九五八年在我国全国范围内根据广大农民的要求普遍建立了人民公社。这是我国社会组织方面的一个具有无比意义的伟大创造。它将加速我国的社会主义建设；它将加速我国从社会主义社会到共产主义社会的过渡，这个伟大意义，决不是世界上那些帝国主义者们和反动分子们所能理解和所能中伤的。
    帝国主义者和国内外一切反动分子们，是不甘心于他们的失败，和不愿意看到我们的祖国走上繁荣富强的道路的。多年以来，他们一贯在进行着卑鄙无耻的破坏活动。最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，又勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，在三月十日发动了可耻的武装叛乱，并且劫持了达赖喇嘛，逃到印度去继续进行叛国活动。对于这一小撮叛国分子的罪恶活动和那些别有用心的外国反动派的无理干涉，我在这里表示无比的愤怒和给以严厉的谴责。西藏自古以来就是我国的领土，在我国自己的领土上平息反动派的叛乱是我国的内政问题。我完全拥护政府对此事件所作出的一切决定和采取的一切措施。
    我是一个工业建设设计工作者，解放以来，一直从事于祖国的和平建设事业，深刻、亲切地体会到我们的设计工作，九年多来已经取得了非常巨大的发展和进步。刚解放时，我国的设计力量和设计水平，都是很薄弱的，几年以来，从无到有，由小到大，现在已经形成了一个比较完整的设计队伍，正如周总理所说的：“我们已经能够自己设计和建设一些比较大型的和技术比较复杂的工业企业”，这正是党和政府对设计工作的深切关怀和正确领导、以及以苏联为首的社会主义兄弟国家给我们的帮助所造成的结果。设计工作在整个建设事业中是一个重要的环节，它是直接决定每一建设事业是否符合多、快、好、省的重要因素，一个优良的设计，不但要在技术上是先进的，在经济上是合理的，更重要的是要能够完全符合国家的政策方针和建设原则。它是高度技术成就和高度政治思想相互结合的具体表现。多少年来党和政府，对我们的设计工作，经常作出正确的指示，并且多次及时地纠正了我们工作中所发生的偏向，这对于使设计工作能够最大限度地为社会主义建设事业服务，起了决定性的作用。这次周总理和李富春副总理，又在报告中给我们的工作指出了明确的方向，我们一定要遵照指示的精神，很好的结合广大群众，解放思想、破除迷信，大力开展技术革命和技术革新运动；在设计中厉行节约，严格保证设计质量，根据国家总路线的要求，按时、按量、按质地做出既便于施工，又利于生产的优良设计。
    作为一个科学技术工作者来讲，我认为最重要的一点，还是我们每个人的自我改造问题，在我们科技工作者的队伍中，绝大部分成员都是知识分子。旧知识分子，包括我在内，是需要积极主动地在工作实践中争取加速改造。周总理在报告中正确的指出：培养新知识分子和改造旧知识分子是文教战线上的一项伟大的历史任务。我们应努力学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东思想，接近群众和深入群众，经常参加体力劳动，学习劳动人民的优秀品质，提高政治觉悟，争取尽快做又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    我们的祖国正在以一日千里的速度发展着，我们未来的任务是无比光荣和无比伟大的，我们要以百倍信心和冲天干劲，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，和全国人民一道，团结在社会主义的旗帜下面，为完成一九五九年的国家宏伟计划而努力，为把我们的祖国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而努力。
