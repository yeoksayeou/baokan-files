We wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou’s "Government Work Report" delivered at the First Session of the Second National People’s Congress, as well as Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s report on the draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan and Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 State Budget Draft. We are also incredibly excited to be attending this meeting as observers. Premier Zhou’s report comprehensively summarized the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist construction and the valuable experience of the great development of the national economy in 1958, pointing out the infinitely bright future of our great motherland. This fills us with confidence in completing and overfulfilling the 1959 national economic construction plan ahead of schedule, making it a resounding clarion call for China's great leap forward in production in 1959.

The unprecedented high-speed development of China's national economy in 1958 eloquently demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system. The doubling of industrial and agricultural production fully proved that the Party's general line for socialist construction and the entire set of policies for "walking on two legs" are correct. Despite the imperialists' attempts to obliterate the facts of China's economic development by all means, the East Wind still overwhelmingly prevailed over the West Wind. Our motherland is developing prosperously and is more prosperous and flourishing than ever before!

The People's Commune's Benefits are Inexhaustible

Premier Zhou’s report mentioned that in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Chinese people made a great creation in social organization, which is the People's Commune established in the rural areas across the country according to the demands of the broad masses of peasants. Starting last summer, the People's Commune movement, like a spring tide, rapidly unfolded in the rural areas across the country within a short few months. The face of the countryside has also undergone fundamental changes. What were once poor mountain villages became strong in manpower and concentrated in economy after communization, with comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. The people's lives rapidly improved. Women were freed from tedious housework and entered the ranks of social production, achieving complete liberation. Because it implemented a distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system, with "free meals," the peasants who used to worry about food and clothing received a reliable guarantee in their lives. The widespread establishment of Homes of Happiness and kindergartens ensured that the widowed, orphaned, and young children were properly cared for, and free schooling allowed school-age children to receive education. These measures brought great benefits to the broad masses of peasants and were warmly welcomed by them. Today, wherever you go, you can hear the people supporting the Party's leadership and praising the People's Commune. Historically, there has never been a political party that cares so much about the interests of the people and strives for their interests. We are proud to live in the great Mao Zedong era and are delighted and encouraged by the unity and prosperity of our motherland's big family!

Inheriting and Developing the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the Common Responsibility of Both Chinese and Western Medicine

With the rapid development of the national economy, China's medical and health work also experienced a Great Leap Forward in 1958. In particular, through the great rectification movement, the work of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) smashed the rampant attacks of right-wing elements, thoroughly criticized various bourgeois ideas and national nihilistic thoughts that belittled, discriminated against, and excluded TCM. The Party's TCM policy was correctly implemented, and a nationwide upsurge of Western medicine practitioners learning TCM emerged. The remarkable curative effects of traditional Chinese medicine on many diseases shone brightly like spring flowers, providing valuable data for the research work considered cutting-edge science by modern medicine, demonstrating the wisdom of our Party's TCM policy. The Party has always attached great importance to traditional Chinese medicine, believing that it is a great treasure house. As long as we work hard to explore, organize, and improve it, it will make a great contribution to human health. Therefore, we should be excited about our great motherland having this valuable cultural heritage and should earnestly implement the Party's TCM policy, regarding the inheritance and development of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine as the glorious and unshirkable task of all our medical workers.

Inheriting and developing traditional Chinese medicine is the common responsibility of both Chinese and Western medicine. Premier Zhou instructed us in his report that "we should unite Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, organize them to jointly serve the people's health cause, and jointly develop the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and the development of medical science." This is the direction of our future work. The Party's TCM policy instructs that "we should study and organize our country's medical heritage and raise it to the level of modern science," which requires us to have a correct concept of "modern science," that is, we should use Marxist-Leninist materialism and dialectics as ideological guidance to understand problems. TCM has rich content and valuable clinical experience and can cure many diseases, but undeniably, it needs further organization and improvement. Western medicine has mastered modern medical science knowledge and technology, can cure many diseases, and has many new things worth learning. Therefore, it must be emphasized that Chinese and Western medicine must cooperate closely, unite as one, walk on two legs, and learn from each other's strengths to accomplish the task assigned by the Party—the integration of Chinese and Western medicine to create a Chinese school of medicine with originality.

In the work of inheriting and developing traditional Chinese medicine, cultivating new forces is a very important issue. Therefore, we must, in accordance with the Party's instructions, run TCM colleges, TCM specialized schools, and research classes for Western medicine practitioners to study TCM full-time, and promptly summarize, exchange, and promote experiences. We must do everything possible and impart our knowledge without reservation to train apprentices well. This is the glorious task of our older generation of TCM practitioners, and we must strive to complete it so that the new forces can grow rapidly, strengthen the ranks of TCM research work, and lay a good foundation for strengthening the integration of Chinese and Western medicine and creating a new Chinese school of medicine.

We cheer for the great achievements and bright future of traditional Chinese medicine under the wise leadership of the Party. We believe that in the work of uniting and cooperating between Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to develop traditional Chinese medicine, we must also implement the principle of "the whole country as one chess game." The Party calls on us Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to cooperate greatly. This is a faster, better, and more economical way to develop traditional Chinese medicine. In cooperation, we should overcome the ideological style of conservatism and departmentalism, establish a communist style, and handle problems from the perspective of the interests of patients. Under the ideological guidance of the whole country as one chess game, we are willing to join hands and unite closely around the Party to strive for the implementation of the TCM policy, inheriting and developing traditional Chinese medicine.

Regarding the Tibet issue, we fully agree with the speeches of Premier Zhou and all the delegates. Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which is recognized worldwide. Quelling the rebellion in Tibet is China's internal affair, and no foreign country can interfere.

    中医西医携手并进
    创造我国医药学派
    蒲辅周　杜自明　赵锡武  冉雪峰　高凤桐委员的联合发言
    我们衷心拥护周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所作“政府工作报告”及李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，并为列席这次会议而感到无比的兴奋。周总理在报告中全面的总结了我国社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就和一九五八年国民经济大发展的宝贵经验，指出了伟大祖国无限美好的远景，使我们对于提前超额完成一九五九年国家经济建设计划，满怀信心，成为一九五九年我国生产大跃进的响亮的号角。
    一九五八年我国国民经济获得了史无前例的高速度发展，雄辩地说明了社会主义制度的优越性，工农业生产成倍的增长，充分地证明了党的社会主义建设总路线和“两条腿走路”的一整套方针是正确的，尽管帝国主义千方百计企图抹煞我国经济发展的事实，但是东风仍然以绝对的优势压倒了西风，我们的祖国正欣欣向荣地发展着，它比任何时代更加繁荣昌盛！
    人民公社好处说不完
    周总理的报告谈到：在一九五八年的大跃进中我国人民在社会组织方面有了一个伟大的创造，这就是全国农村中根据广大农民的要求而建立的人民公社。从去年夏季开始在短短的几个月中，人民公社化运动像春潮一样，迅速地在全国农村开展起来，农村的面貌也随着发生了根本的变化，原来是贫困的山村，公社化以后人力强，经济集中，农林牧副渔全面发展，人民的生活迅速的得到了改善。妇女摆脱了烦琐的家务劳动，走进了社会生产的行列，得到了彻底的解放。由于它实行了供给制和工资制相结合的分配制度，“吃饭不要钱”，使从前愁吃愁穿的农民得到了生活上的可靠保证。幸福院、幼儿园的普遍设立，使鳏寡孤独和幼儿各得其所，免费入学，使学龄儿童获得了受教育的机会。这些措施，给广大农民带来了极大的好处，受到他们热烈的欢迎，今天您随便走到那里，都能听见人民拥护党的领导、赞扬人民公社的欢呼声。历史上，像这样关心人民利益，以人民的利益为奋斗目标的政党是史无前例的，我们为生活在伟大的毛泽东时代而感到骄傲，为祖国大家庭的团结一致和欣欣向荣而欢欣鼓舞！
    继承和发扬祖国医学遗产是中西医的共同责任
    随着国民经济的飞跃发展，我国的医药卫生工作在一九五八年也出现了大跃进的形势。特别是中医工作，通过伟大的整风运动，打垮了右派分子的猖狂进攻，彻底批判了各种轻视歧视排斥中医的资产阶级思想和民族虚无主义思想，党的中医政策得到了正确的贯彻，全国范围内掀起了西医学习中医的热潮。祖国医学对许多疾病的卓越疗效像春天的花朵一样，大放异彩，为现代医学认为的尖端科学的研究工作，提供了宝贵的资料，说明我们党的中医政策的英明。党对祖国医学从来就很重视，认为祖国医学是个伟大的宝库，只要努力发掘并加以整理提高，就将对人类保健事业作出巨大的贡献。因此我们应该为我们伟大祖国有这一份宝贵的文化遗产而感到兴奋，应该认真贯彻党的中医政策，把继承和发扬祖国医学遗产当作我们全体医务人员义不容辞的光荣任务。
    继承发扬祖国医学，是中西医共同的责任。周总理在报告中指示我们，“应当团结中西医，组织他们共同为人民卫生事业服务，共同发扬祖国医学遗产和发展医药科学”，这是我们今后工作的方向。党的中医政策指示；“研究整理我国医药遗产，把它提高到现代科学水平”，这就要求我们对“现代科学”有一个正确的概念，也就是应该以马列主义唯物论辩证法为思想指导，来认识问题。中医有丰富的内容和宝贵的临床经验，能够治好很多疾病，但是不可否认，还需要进一步的整理和提高。西医掌握了现代医学科学知识和技术，能够医好很多疾病，有很多新的东西值得我们吸取。因此必须强调中西医亲密合作，团结一致，用两条腿走路，取长补短，才能完成党交给的任务——中西医合流，创造我国有独创性的医药学派。
    在继承和发扬祖国医学的工作中，培养新生力量是一个很重要的问题。因此，我们必须按照党的指示，办好中医学院，中医专科学校，和西医脱产学习中医的研究班，及时总结经验交流推广。必须尽一切可能，毫无保留的带好徒弟，这是我们老一辈中医的光荣任务，我们一定要努力完成，使新生力量迅速成长，加强中医研究工作的队伍，为加强中西医合流，创造中国新医学派打下良好基础。
    我们为祖国医学在党的英明领导下所取得的巨大成就和灿烂前途而欢呼，我们认为在中西医团结合作发扬祖国医学的工作中，还必须贯彻“全国一盘棋”的原则。党号召我们中西医大协作，这是发扬祖国医学的多快好省的办法，在协作中，应该克服故步自封，本位主义的思想作风，树立共产主义的风格，一切从病人的利益出发来处理问题。在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，愿我们共同携起手来紧密地团结在党的周围，为贯彻中医政策，继承发扬祖国医学而奋斗。
    关于西藏问题，我们完全同意周总理及各位代表的发言。西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，是世界所公认的；平定西藏叛乱是中国的内政，是任何外国不能干涉的。
