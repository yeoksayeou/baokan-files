A New Stage for Forestry
Speech by Committee Member Chen Rong

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am extremely excited and moved to be participating in the Third National Committee of the CPPCC and to have studied the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan over the past few days. Now I would like to offer some thoughts on forestry issues:

Although agriculture and forestry both utilize land for production, their development processes differ greatly. In ancient times, when the population was very sparse, almost the entire surface of the earth, except for rivers, seas, ice mountains, etc., was covered by forests. Later, as the population gradually increased, it became necessary to clear forests for cultivation, even using slash-and-burn methods, which led to the destruction and gradual reduction of forests. In recent centuries, with the invention of science and the prosperity of industry and commerce, the demand for timber and various forest products increased sharply, and forest harvesting became widespread, leading to even greater devastation. As a result, not only was it impossible to supply forest products, but climate imbalances, landslides, river blockages, and frequent droughts, floods, and sandstorms occurred. Thus, the harm of lacking forests began to be recognized by the world, and it became necessary to re-establish forests. Forestry began from this point. The entire process has two important stages:

First, the pioneering stage of forestry.

Originally, the area around Prussia in Western Europe was a wasteland with a dry climate and barren soil. Through years of efforts by the Germanic people in afforestation and forest protection, natural conditions gradually improved. As early as 1368, large-scale artificial afforestation of spruce, fir, and other trees began, and in 1483, thorough and comprehensive fire prevention regulations were implemented. Various forestry issues were systematically studied very early on.

Following this, other countries gradually paid attention to forestry management. However, from a global perspective, although the importance of forestry was recognized early on, the pace of forestry progress was very slow. The main reason was that forestry required large-scale unified management and focused on general and long-term benefits, which contradicted the capitalist social system.

Chinese forestry started even earlier than in Western Europe, but unfortunately, it failed to develop along the right track due to long-term feudal rule.

Second, the development stage of forestry.

Since the October Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union, because its important agricultural and pastoral areas in the European part were attacked by hot winds from the Central Asian desert, often experienced periodic droughts. In the past twenty-five years, the Volga region alone had suffered more than twenty droughts. On December 24, 1948, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government issued the "Great Plan for Transforming Nature," which aimed to create eight forest shelterbelts by the government within fifteen years to block the hot winds of Central Asia, increase snow cover, and improve the soil, to ensure a good agricultural harvest in the grassland areas of the European part. According to scientific calculations, after the completion of this forest belt, grain production in the area would increase by 25% to 30% compared to before, vegetables by 50% to 75%, and forage crops by 100% to 200%. The above plan has been completed ahead of schedule, and the expected results have been gradually realized.

China has a very scarce forest resource, with forests covering less than 10% of the country's land area, and their distribution is uneven, often leading to wind, sand, water, and drought disasters. It was not until the founding of the People's Republic of China that attention began to be paid to forestry, and the Ministry of Forestry was first established at the central level.

During the economic recovery period (1950-1952), the forestry policy was: universal forest protection, key afforestation, and rational harvesting and utilization of timber.

During the First Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957), the forestry construction policy was: universal forest and mountain protection, vigorous afforestation and cultivation, and rational harvesting and utilization of timber.

The afforestation area in the above eight years was about 250 million mu, with an annual average of more than 30 million mu. From the Xinhai Revolution to before liberation (1912-1946), a total of 4.5 million mu were afforested in thirty-five years, with an annual average of less than 130,000 mu.

In particular, the promulgation of the great Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program (draft) in 1956, which proposed to green the barren mountains and wasteland across the country within twelve years, gave great encouragement to the people of the whole country. After the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, a great leap forward was launched, and the afforestation area in 1958 alone reached 400 million mu, almost twice the total of the previous eight years. Inspired by the bumper harvests in agriculture, the forestry sector also discovered many fast-growing and high-yielding examples of timber forests and economic forests created by the masses. In difficult areas, such as deserts, rocky mountains, and saline-alkali land, valuable experience has also been gained in afforestation techniques. In short, the entire forestry sector in 1958, in terms of production, scientific research, and even education, experienced a great leap forward and achieved great successes.

One thing that needs to be paid special attention to is that the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1958 pointed out that the "three-three system" of cultivated land should be gradually realized within a few years, and finally achieve the "gardenization of the land," beautifying the whole of China!

At present, the national forestry front is advancing towards the desert and developing towards fast-growing and high-yielding trees, completely eliminating forest disasters, comprehensive utilization of timber, forest product chemistry, and forestry mechanization.

As mentioned above, the new situation of rapid progress in forestry at the present stage, taking China and the Soviet Union as examples, is equivalent to decades in the past; this is entirely rooted in the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Therefore, we forestry workers should, under the leadership of the Party, continue to emancipate our minds, break down superstitions, and work with the broad masses of the people to go all out, dedicate ourselves to our great socialist construction cause, and strive to do a good job in the historical tasks of this stage of forestry!

### 林业的新阶段  陈嵘委员的发言

    林业的新阶段
    陈嵘委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我这次得参加第三届政协全国会议，连日学习了周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的各项报告，极为兴奋和感动。现在就本行林业上的问题，提点感想：
    农业林业虽同是利用土地来生产的事业，但两者发展的过程很多不同。当在古代人口非常稀少时，地球表面除了河海冰山等以外，几乎到处为森林所被复。以后人口渐增，有毁林开垦之必要，甚至采用刀耕火种，因是森林受到破坏而渐次减少。至近数世纪，科学发明，工商业繁盛，木材及各种林产物需要激增，森林采伐更无远不到，以致荒废益甚。至此不但林产无从供应，并且气候失调，山崩河塞，水旱风沙之害频作，于是缺乏森林之害，始为世人所认识，不得不重行营造森林，所谓林业即自此开始。其整个过程有两个重要阶段：
    第一、林业开创阶段
    原来在西欧普鲁士一带是个荒原，气候干燥，土壤瘠薄，经日耳曼民族多年努力于造林护林，使自然条件逐渐好转。当公元一三六八年就开始云杉、冷杉等大规模的人工造林，一四八三年就彻底实行了周密的防火条例，有关林业的各种问题，很早就开始有系统的研讨。
    继此之后，其他国家亦逐渐注意林业经营。然从全世界角度来看，林业的重要性虽早经认识，林业进展的速度，非常迟慢。主要原因是：林业需要大规模统一的经营，并且着重于普遍长远利益，这是与资本主义社会制度，互相矛盾的。
    中国林业较西欧更早开始，可惜因长期封建统治，也未能循轨发达。
    第二、林业发展阶段
    自经一九一七年十月革命后，苏联因其欧洲部分重要的农业区畜牧区受中亚沙漠地带热风之袭击，常起周期性干旱，在过去二十五年间，仅伏尔加区就曾经发生旱灾二十多次。联共中央苏联政府特于一九四八年十二月二十四日发表“改造自然的伟大计划”，即在十五年内由政府营造八条森林防护带以遮断中亚热风，增加积雪，改良土壤，来保证欧洲部分草原地区的农业丰收。此项林带完成后根据科学计算，该区粮食产量将较以前可增加百分之二十五至三十，蔬菜类百分之五十至七十五，饲料作物百分之一百至二百。以上计划已提前完成，而预期效果，已逐步实现。
    我国森林资源非常缺少，森林面积不及国土面积百分之十，并且分布不均，时常有风沙水旱之害。直至中华人民共和国成立，才开始重视林业，首先于中央建立林业部。
    在经济恢复时期（一九五○至一九五二年）的林政方针是：普遍护林，重点造林，合理采伐利用木材。
    第一个五年计划期间（一九五三至一九五七年）林业建设的方针是：普遍护林护山，大力造林育林，合理采伐利用木材。
    以上八年造林面积约二亿五千万亩，每年平均三千万亩以上。自辛亥革命后到解放前（一九一二至一九四六年）三十五年间，共造林四百五十万亩，每年平均不及十三万亩。
    尤其一九五六年，伟大的农业发展纲要四十条（草案）的颁布，其中提出要在十二年内绿化全国荒山荒地，这给全国人民极大的鼓舞。在整风反右后，更掀起大跃进高潮，一九五八年一年间造林面积竟达到四亿亩，几为前八年总和的两倍。受到农业丰产的启发，林业上也发现了许多群众所创造的用材林和经济林速生丰产事迹。又在困难地区，如沙漠、石山、盐碱地等造林技术，亦得到许多宝贵经验。总之，一九五八年整个林业在生产、科学研究以至教育方面，都出现了大跃进的局面，取得了巨大成就。
    要特别注意的一件事：就是一九五八年中共八届六中全会指出在若干年内逐步实现耕地“三三制”，最后达到“大地园林化”，美化全中国！
    目前全国林业战线，正向沙漠进军和朝着林木速生丰产，彻底消灭森林灾害，木材综合利用，林产化学，林业机械化等方面发展。
    如上所述，以中苏两国为例的现阶段林业飞速进展的新形势，一年等于从前数十年；这完全是根源于社会主义制度的无比优越性。因此我们林业工作者，应在党的领导下，继续解放思想，破除迷信，与广大群众一起鼓足干劲，献身于我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，并为做好这阶段林业历史的任务而奋斗！
