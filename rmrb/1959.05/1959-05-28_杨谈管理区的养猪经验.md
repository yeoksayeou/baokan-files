    Yangtan Management Area's Pig Raising Experience
    Ma Ping
    The Yangtan Management Area of Qucun Commune in Houma City, Shanxi Province, has adopted the policy of "public and private raising in parallel," which has greatly developed the pig raising industry. In the short seven months after the communization, the number of pigs in this management area increased from 2,300 to 3,460. Now, the average household has five pigs, and this year, each mu of land can have 5,000 jin of pig manure.

      Raising Pigs to Accumulate Fertilizer for Grain and Cotton Production
    The Yangtan Management Area has 708 households and 16,000 mu of land. Because there are many hillside terraces and the soil is barren, coupled with a shortage of labor, crop yields have historically been very low. How can agricultural production be rapidly developed in such an area? The masses have been circulating these few sentences: "The soil at the foot of the northern mountain is thin, the terraces are full of stone, if you want a great harvest of grain and cotton, opening up fertilizer sources is the top priority." Opening up fertilizer sources is the key to increasing production, but where to open up fertilizer sources? The cadres and masses of the original advanced cooperative have conducted many discussions. Rely on chemical fertilizers? The investment is too large, and the state cannot supply it in large quantities. Rely on accumulating soil fertilizer? The quality is low and the source is limited. Finally, it was determined to raise pigs in large numbers to establish a fertilizer base.
    In 1958, this management area raised 300 fattened pigs. In addition to selling 150 to the state, the members consumed more than 100; more than 3,000 piglets were bred throughout the year, which basically met the development needs of the area. These pigs produced a total of 50 million jin of fertilizer, an average of 3,000 jin of pig manure per mu. This greatly contributed to the bumper harvest of grain and cotton in 1958: cotton production doubled, with a yield of 93 jin of ginned cotton per mu; grain production also increased by 40%, with a yield of 223 jin per mu. The average actual income per person in the entire management area was 114 yuan, exceeding the level of wealthy middle peasants in the local area, and grain and cotton yields caught up with and surpassed the surrounding management areas with better conditions.
    Because every household raises pigs, the elderly, weak, and disabled have work to do and income. Agricultural by-products can also be fully utilized, truly making the most of everything. It is estimated that in 1959, the entire management area can raise 1,800 fattened pigs, producing 100,000 jin of meat, and breed 6,000 piglets. These two items alone can generate an income of 70,000 yuan; at the same time, 90 million jin of pig manure can be accumulated, an average of 5,000 jin of pig manure per mu. This is of great significance for increasing grain and cotton production this year. The members summarized the benefits of raising pigs as: everyone has work to do, money to spend, and meat to eat, supporting the country, and the land has fertilizer to increase production.

          Public and Private Raising Simultaneously
    The development of the pig raising industry in this place has not been smooth sailing. The first time, they bought 200 piglets from other places. Due to the long journey and bringing back swine fever from other places, they died, leaving only four. The second time, they bought 60 fine breed pigs, and for the same reason, only one remained. The third time, they bought 30 large white pigs, and as a result, not even one was left. Not only that, the swine fever brought from other places also infected the local pig herds, causing some of the original pigs to die. Some people made sarcastic remarks, calling this "losing both the lady and the soldiers." But this did not shake people's determination to develop the pig raising industry. On the contrary, they summarized the lessons learned from the failures: pig raising must also follow the mass line. Under the current conditions, public and private raising must be given equal importance, and the road of self-breeding and self-raising must be taken. Developing collective pig raising in isolation is not feasible. They stipulated that each pig should be allocated two fen of land as feed land (four fen for sows); piglets bred by members should be purchased at reasonable prices; pig manure should be purchased according to different grades and prices; and unified disinfection and epidemic prevention should be carried out. These regulations were welcomed by the masses, and a mass pig raising upsurge quickly formed. As of the end of August last year, the number of pigs increased from 600 to 2,300, of which individual pig raising increased from 420 to 1,380, and collective pig raising increased from 180 to 920.
    After the people's commune, the degree of collectivization and public ownership became greater. The contradiction between individual pig raising by members and collective labor became more prominent. Qi Haichuan, a member, raised two large sows, producing more than 50 piglets a year, with an income of 300 yuan. Therefore, he was not actively participating in the labor of the commune, and the captain and members had a lot of opinions. Under these circumstances, some people advocated that the pigs should be raised by the commune, and some advocated restricting individual sow raising by lowering the price of piglets and other methods. The management committee studied these opinions and believed that if the pigs were taken over by the commune, the labor, feed, and pig pens would not be easy to solve, and the members would not be willing. After discussion, everyone agreed that the policy of public and private raising simultaneously should continue to be adhered to. The management area announced that feed land would be reserved for members who raise pigs, and piglets and fertilizer from members would be purchased at the market price. In order to closely integrate individual pig raising with collective labor, in addition to strengthening collectivist education, a vacation system and a basic work day system were implemented. At the same time, a deputy director was drawn to strengthen the leadership of the collective pig raising industry, establish a pig raising professional team, and strengthen the feeding responsibility system. Facts have proved that this method has achieved good results, and the number of pigs has increased by more than 1,000 in a few months.

      Establishing a Pig Feed Base
    The pig raising industry has developed greatly, and the original sources of feed - fully utilizing agricultural by-products, collecting wild vegetables, wild grasses and leaves, etc. - can no longer meet the needs. What to do? The management committee decided to establish a pig feed base. It was stipulated that regardless of whether pigs are raised collectively or individually, two fen of feed land should be reserved for each pig (four fen for sows). The management area's pig farm established a 150-mu feed base centered on the workshop. The pig farms of each production team also established 22 pieces of pig feed land. Members, on a household basis, reserved feed land according to the number of pigs raised, and managed it themselves. Pig feed land is generally planted with two types of feed: one is green feed, and the other is concentrated feed. In order to ensure that there is sufficient feed for pigs throughout the year, members pay more attention to the collection of agricultural by-products.

      Four Fixes, One Reward, Double-Layer Contracting
    In order to strengthen the management of collective pig raising and strengthen the responsibility system, a double-layer contracting system of four fixes and one reward was implemented between the management area, the production team, and the professional team. The four fixes are: 1. Fix the task. The management area assigns the task to each production team according to the pig raising plan of the whole area. The principle is three pigs per household and one pig per three mu of land. The production team then fixes the task of collective pig raising to the professional team. The standard is 25 fattened pigs per person per year (each weighing 100 jin); raising one sow is equivalent to one meat pig task, the sow produces two litters of piglets a year, with an average of eight piglets per litter; piglets leave the trough after two months (each weighing ten jin); each pig accumulates 20 carts of fertilizer a year (each cart weighing 1,300 jin). 2. Fix professional feeders. Feeders should be selected like choosing a son-in-law. 3. Fix feed. Agricultural by-products are distributed to professional teams and individual members according to the number of pigs raised. According to regulations, 40 jin of concentrated feed are issued for each fattened pig raised, and 60 jin of concentrated feed are issued for breeding sows each year. 4. Fix work points. 150 work points are recorded for each qualified meat pig raised, and 15 work points are recorded for raising one piglet. The management area implements task contracting to the production team, with work points assigned to the team, the total amount is divided, and the team is responsible for profits and losses. Generally, the fertilizer from pig raising is used by the team, and the income from selling meat pigs belongs to the management area. The production team and the professional team implement overproduction rewards. The method is to award 4 work points for each jin exceeding 100 jin of meat pigs; award 50 work points for each additional piglet produced by each sow exceeding 16 piglets per year; award 15 work points for each jin exceeding 10 jin of piglets leaving the trough; award 15 work points for each cart exceeding 20 carts of fertilizer accumulated by each pig. According to the spirit of the four fixes and one reward, the production team signs a contract with the management area, and the professional team signs a contract with the production team. This double-layer contract strengthens the responsibility of pig raising at all levels and mobilizes the pig raising enthusiasm of feeders, professional teams, and production teams. Many professional teams have already broken through the contracted quota. Feeder Yang Zaichun has exceeded the quota of 25 fattened pigs and can raise more than 40 fattened pigs this year.

          Prevention is More Important than Treatment, Eliminate Swine Fever
    "Raising pigs without epidemic prevention is a waste of effort," this is a lesson learned by local farmers in developing the pig raising industry. In this large-scale development of live pigs, they adhered to the principle of "prevention first, prevention is more important than treatment." On the one hand, improve feeding management to enhance the physique of pigs, and minimize the spread of diseases in self-breeding and self-raising; on the other hand, regularly inject vaccines to enhance disease resistance. This management area implements a pig pen for every pig, and disinfects regularly. It is precisely because of this that there has been no swine fever in the past year.

    杨谈管理区的养猪经验
    马平
    山西侯马市曲村公社杨谈管理区采取“公养和私养并举”的方针，使养猪事业有了很大的发展。这个管理区的生猪，在公社化后短短七个月里，由两千三百口发展到三千四百六十口。现在平均每户有五口猪，今年每亩地可有五千斤猪肥。
      养猪积肥粮棉增产
    杨谈管理区有七百零八户，一万六千亩土地。由于山坡梯田多，土质瘠薄，加上劳力少，历来作物产量很低。在这样的地区怎样迅速发展农业生产呢？群众中流传着这样几句话：“北山脚下土质薄，等等梯田石底多，要想粮棉大丰产，开辟肥源最当先。”开辟肥源是增产的关键，但到哪里去开辟肥源呢？原高级社的干部和群众曾经进行过多次讨论。依靠化学肥料？投资太大，国家也不可能大量供应。依靠积土肥？质量低，而且来源有限。最后确定要大量养猪，建立肥料基地。
    1958年这个管理区育成肥猪三百口，除卖给国家一百五十口外，社员个人食用了一百多口；全年繁殖小猪三千多口，基本上满足了本区发展的需要。这些猪一共产肥料五千万斤，平均亩施猪肥三千斤。这大大有助于1958年粮棉的大丰收：棉花产量翻了一番，亩产量达到皮棉九十三斤；粮食产量也增加40％，亩产量达到二百二十三斤。全管理区每人平均实收入一百一十四元，超过了当地富裕中农的水平，粮棉产量赶上和超过了周围条件较好的管理区。
    由于家家户户养猪，老弱残废的人都有活干，都有收入。农业副产品也因此得以充分利用，真正做到了物尽其用。预计1959年全管理区可育肥猪一千八百口，产肉十万斤，繁殖小猪六千口，光这两项即可收入七万元；同时可积猪肥九千万斤，平均每亩地有猪肥五千斤。这对今年粮棉的增产有重大的意义。社员们总结养猪的好处是：人人有活干，有钱花，有肉吃，支援国家，地里有肥能多增产。
          公养私养同时并举
    这个地方养猪事业的发展并不是一帆风顺的。第一次，他们从外地买回二百口小猪，由于路途远，加以从外地带回了猪瘟，结果死得剩下四口。第二次又买回优种猪六十口，同样原因死得只剩了一口。第三次买回三十口大白猪，结果死得连一口也未剩下。不仅如此，从外地带来的猪瘟，还传染给本地猪群，使原有的猪也死去了一部分。一些人说风凉话，把这叫作“赔了夫人又折兵”。但这并没有动摇人们对发展养猪事业的决心。相反，他们在失败中总结了经验教训：养猪也必须走群众路线，在当前条件下，公养和私养要同时并重，走自繁自养的道路，孤立地发展集体养猪是不行的。他们规定每口猪留二分地作为饲料地（母猪留四分）；用合理价格收买社员繁殖的小猪；分等论价，收买猪肥料；统一消毒防疫等。这些规定，受到群众欢迎，于是迅速形成了一个群众性的养猪高潮。截至去年8月底，猪由六百口发展到两千三百口，其中个人养猪由四百二十口发展到一千三百八十口，集体养猪由一百八十口发展到九百二十口。
    人民公社化后，集体化和公有化程度更大了。社员个人养猪和集体劳动的矛盾，显现得更突出了。社员祁海川养了两口大母猪，年产仔猪五十多口，收入三百元，因此不积极参加社里的劳动，队长和社员们很有意见。在这种情况下，有人主张猪归社养，有人主张用降低小猪价等办法限制个人养母猪。管理委员会研究了这些意见，认为收归社养，劳力、饲料、猪圈都不好解决，社员也不会愿意。经过讨论，大家一致认为应该继续坚持公养和私养同时并举的方针。管理区宣布了给养猪的社员留饲料地，照价收买社员的小猪和肥料。为了把个人养猪与集体劳动密切结合起来，除加强集体主义教育外，实行了休假制度和基本劳动日制度，同时抽出一个副主任，加强对集体养猪事业的领导，建立养猪专业队，加强喂养责任制度。事实证明，这种办法获得了良好的效果，养猪的数目几个月里又增加了一千多口。
      建立养猪饲料基地
    养猪事业大大发展了，原有的饲料来源——充分利用农业副产品，采集野菜野草和树叶等，已经满足不了需要。怎么办呢？管委会决定建立养猪饲料基地。规定不论集体或个人养猪，每养一口猪留给二分饲料地（母猪留四分）。管理区的猪场以作坊为中心建立了一个一百五十亩的饲料基地。各个生产队的猪场，也建立了二十二片养猪饲料地。社员以户为单位按养猪多少，分别留给饲料地，归自己经营。养猪饲料地一般种两类饲料：一类是青饲料，一类是精饲料。为保证喂猪在一年四季都有充足的饲料，社员们更加重视农业副产品等的收集。
      四定一奖双层承包
    为了加强对集体养猪的管理，加强责任制，管理区、生产队和专业队三者之间，实行了四定一奖的双层承包合同制。四定是：一、定任务，管理区按全区的养猪计划把任务分配给各生产队。原则是每户三头，每三亩地有一口猪。生产队再把集体养猪的任务固定给专业队，标准是，每人每年育肥猪二十五口（每口重一百斤）；养一口母猪顶一口肉猪任务，母猪年产仔猪两窝，每窝平均八口；小猪两个月出槽（每口重十斤）；每口猪一年积肥二十车（每车重一千三百斤）。二、定专业饲养员，要像挑女婿一样挑养猪饲养员。三、定饲料，农业副产品按养猪多少分给专业队和社员个人。按规定每养成一口肥猪，发精饲料四十斤，生育母猪每年发精饲料六十斤。四、定工分，每育成一口合标准的肉猪记工一百五十分，养一口小猪，记工十五分。管理区对生产队实行任务包干，工分到队，总额分成，盈亏由队负责。一般是养猪的肥料归队使用，卖肉猪收入归管理区。生产队和专业队实行超产奖励，办法是肉猪超过一百斤的，每超过一斤奖工四分；每口母猪每年生产小猪十六口以上者，每增一口奖工五十分；出槽小猪达十斤以上者，每超一斤奖工十五分。每头猪积肥二十车以上者，每超一车奖工十五分。根据四定一奖的精神，生产队向管理区订承包合同，专业队向生产队订承包合同。这种双层承包合同，加强了各级养猪的责任心，调动了饲养员、专业队、生产队的养猪积极性。许多专业队已经突破了包工定额。饲养员杨再春超过了育肥猪二十五口的定额，今年可育肥猪四十多口。
          防重于治杜绝猪瘟
    “养猪不防疫，徒劳无收益”，这是当地农民在发展养猪事业中得到的一条教训。在这次大量发展生猪中，他们坚持了“预防为主，防重于治”的方针。一方面改进饲养管理，增强猪的体质，在自繁自养中，尽量减少疫病的传染；另一方面，定期注射疫苗，增强抗病能力。这个管理区实行猪猪有圈，并定期消毒。正是由于这样，一年来没有发生过猪瘟。
