    Empty Talk and Practical Work
    Wang Che

    "Not practical," this is a phrase often used to criticize bookworms, dreamers, and idle talkers. That a person should be practical seems to have long been a matter of common sense. So, when Chairman Mao proposed last year that we should "engage in empty talk," everyone felt that this term was very fresh and began to think about the relationship between practical work and empty talk.

    When "empty talk" is mentioned, some people may initially think of such questions: Is this not "unreal"? How can engaging in both empty talk and practical work be unified? It is natural for such questions to arise. The word "empty" can have the meaning of "void" or "nothing," or it can have the meaning of "unreal," which can be understood by seeing what words "empty" is often linked with to form phrases: "emptiness," "nothingness," "illusion," "falsehood," "vanity"... Therefore, when "empty" is mentioned, it always seems to be something unreliable. Conversely, "real" things are truly existing, credible, and reliable; so we often say "real," "actual," and "existing."

    "Real" refers to concrete things with form and shadow, while "empty" refers to abstract things without form and shadow. Does the world only consist of things with form and shadow? Thought itself is an "empty" thing, but everyone knows from their own experience that thought exists. Of course, there is a distinction between correct and wrong thoughts. Concepts like gods and ghosts are false; they are not faithful reflections of reality but illusions in people's minds. However, many philosophical and scientific categories or concepts, such as "commonality," "absolute," "possibility," "law," "value," "abstract labor," etc., are also invisible and intangible, but they are not false. The theories constructed with these categories or concepts are the same. Scientific concepts, principles, laws, and theories are intangible and abstract things, but they are also absolutely true. We cannot doubt their truthfulness or doubt that they are reflections of objective reality simply because they are intangible.

    As far as the current situation is concerned, understanding the "empty" in "engaging in empty talk" as "false" is a misunderstanding of a very small number of comrades with low cultural levels. A more common misunderstanding is that all theories are seen as empty things with no practical use. According to some people, it seems that comrades who do not study are always more practical than those who love to study, and comrades who read pamphlets are always more practical than those who "gnaw at large volumes." Therefore, we need to take a deeper look at the relationship between the empty and the real.

    "Empty" and "real" are a unity of opposites. "Real" refers to actual situations, real life, and practice, while "empty" refers to the internal essence and laws of things, and the thoughts and theories that reflect this essence and these laws. Essence and law govern phenomena, and ideological understanding guides practice. Therefore, the empty and the real cannot be separated into two distinct parts. Our practice is to transform the objective world, which is what we mean by "practical work." But to successfully transform the objective world, we must transform the subjective world, which is "empty talk." The proletarian party organizes the practice of the masses of people, guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism, combined with the actual conditions of the time and place, to lead the people in the struggle to transform the objective world, and to transform their own subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world. This is the political task of the proletariat. The Party advocates empty talk to promote the discussion of thoughts, theories, and politics. Politics is the commander, and thought is the soul, so we say that we should "lead the real with the empty."

    The empty exists in the real, and the empty should not be separated from the real. We say "seek truth from facts." "Facts" are undoubtedly "real," but what is "truth"? Chairman Mao explained that it is the internal connection of things, that is, regularity. Then "truth" is "empty." But as long as it is "truth" and not "falsehood," then it is empty but not false. Is it "empty" in the sense of being vacuous? That depends on how you say it. If we treat theory dogmatically, turning it into "water without a source" or "a tree without roots" that is divorced from reality, then of course it will be empty. This kind of empty theory has no practical use at all. But if theory comes from practice and returns to practice, then it will have rich and substantial content, and although it is empty, it will not be vacuous.

    Therefore, although the term "engaging in empty talk" is very new, the meaning it contains is what the Party has always emphasized. "On Practice" discusses the relationship between practice and knowledge, which can also be said to be the relationship between practical work and empty talk.

    Engaging in empty talk is for the sake of better practical work. Whether engaging in empty talk is done well depends on the actual effect of engaging in empty talk. In 1958, drawing on the lessons of the relatively slow development of production in 1957, the Party Central Committee put forward the general line for socialist construction, advocated emancipating the mind, breaking superstitions, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Cadres and the masses all engaged in a great deal of empty talk, and the result was remarkable. Marxism-Leninism indeed produced grain and steel. It can be seen that the "empty" can greatly affect the "real," and the "empty" can be transformed into the "real." Lenin said, "Man's consciousness not only reflects the objective world, but also creates the objective world," which shows the importance of engaging in empty talk.

    Engaging in practical work without engaging in empty talk will inevitably lead to practical work not being done well or thoroughly. Empiricists and pragmatists are all people who value practical work and belittle empty talk, but they often fail to see the essence of things or find the direction of their work, and therefore their work is difficult to carry out and does not achieve great results. In the past, many peasants were very practical in their daily lives, and would not believe anything they had not experienced themselves, but when they got sick, they would pray to gods, worship Buddha, and tell fortunes, completely believing in those mysterious things. Why is this? It is precisely because they did not engage in enough empty talk and did not understand scientific principles.

    We oppose dogmatism, but we must advocate reading. The reason for dogmatism is not reading too much, but not engaging in enough practical work, and also not reading enough. This is a question of the purpose and method of reading, not whether to read or not. Even now, there are still many people who hold the view that reading is a dangerous thing, and if you want to read, it is best to read some pamphlets and not "gnaw at large volumes." Some people even think that since theory comes from practice, then once you have practice, you don't need to learn theory anymore, and practical experience is the richest and most brilliant theory. These people value the real and belittle the empty, substituting the real for the empty. Personal practical experience belongs to the category of the "real," while the "empty" we are talking about refers to rational knowledge. Going from perceptual experience to rational knowledge is a qualitative leap, which is not a simple matter. Chairman Mao once summarized this process in four sentences: "Discard the crude and select the refined, discard the false and retain the true, proceed from one to the other, and go from the outside to the inside." My personal understanding is that "discarding the crude and selecting the refined" is a preliminary selection of factual materials, discarding those irrelevant and unimportant things and retaining useful and valuable things; "discarding the false and retaining the true" is a further examination of these materials, distinguishing which are unreliable and untrue, and which are reliable and true; "proceeding from one to the other" is finding the connections between various materials and aspects of the problem – first external connections, then internal connections; in this way, we go from the external manifestation of things to the internal essence, which is "going from the outside to the inside." The knowledge gained in this way is called rational knowledge. Therefore, although theory comes from practice, practice itself can never replace theory.

    Only engaging in practical work without engaging in empty talk, on the surface, seems to be paying great attention to practice, but in reality, it is not seriously treating practice. Personal practical experience and the environment one comes into contact with are always relatively narrow and one-sided. We cannot only focus on the "small reality" of personal work and ignore the "big reality" of society. Without understanding the overall situation, we cannot understand the local situation. Although theory itself is not practice, it is summarized from the long-term practice of hundreds of millions of people. From this point of view, we can also say that "there is the real in the empty." This kind of theory can help us to correctly and profoundly understand the current reality around us, and can help us to better engage in practical work.

    Conversely, engaging in empty talk without engaging in practical work will certainly not lead to good empty talk, and of course, there will be no practical results. Since Chairman Mao proposed engaging in empty talk last year, many organizations have attached importance to theoretical study and the study of problems. Due to engaging in empty talk, work has been improved, which is a gratifying thing. But there are also some cadres who talk about ideas all day long, do little work, and do not go deep into reality, resulting in idle talk. This is probably worth noting. Without actual situations, materials, and experience, there is no way to engage in empty talk; even if there are situations and experiences, if they are insufficient, engaging in empty talk to a certain extent will feel impossible to continue, leading to no results. It seems that there are two deviations in this issue: one is that a lot of work has been done, and a large pile of situations and experiences have been accumulated, but little analysis, research, and summary are carried out, so that it cannot be improved; the other is that there are not many situations and experiences, and only based on hearsay, fragmentary words, or a superficial understanding of something without in-depth investigation and research, there is a lot of discussion, which of course will lead to exaggeration and emptiness. Sometimes, after arguing back and forth, because neither side has enough material, the argument does not produce any results. Therefore, we must pay attention to "discussing the empty based on the real."

    In short, we must achieve a combination of the empty and the real. Of course, there is also a division of labor here. Those who engage in theoretical work should spend more time engaging in empty talk, and those who engage in practical work should spend more time engaging in practical work. However, those who engage in theoretical work must also engage in practical work. They cannot sit in their study all year round, and they cannot conduct abstract research divorced from the needs of reality and practical materials. Those who engage in practical work must also engage in empty talk. They cannot fail to take some time to study policies and theories, to study problems, and to summarize experiences. Engaging in empty talk without engaging in practical work will lead to becoming an empty politician or a dogmatic theorist; engaging in practical work without engaging in empty talk will lead to becoming a practical worker who has lost direction or a blind pragmatist. Combining the empty and the real, discussing the empty based on the real, and leading the real with the empty are the correct principles.

    务虚与务实
    王澈
    “不务实”，这是一句常常用来批评书呆子、空想家和清谈家的话。一个人应当务实，这一点似乎早已成为常识的观念。所以去年毛主席提出要我们“务虚”时，大家都感觉到这个名词很新鲜，并且开始思索到务实和务虚的关系问题。
    提到“务虚”，可能有人最初会想到这样的问题：这是不是“不实”？既务虚又务实，这怎么能统一？发生这样的问题是很自然的。“虚”字可以有“空”或“无”的意思，也可以有“不真实”的意思，这只要看“虚”字经常同什么字联结起来造词就知道了：“虚空”“虚无”“虚幻”“虚假”“虚妄”……。所以，一提到“虚”，总好像是不怎么可靠的东西。相反，“实”的东西，才是真正存在的，可信的，靠得住的；所以我们常常说“真实”“实在”“实有”。
    “实”是有形有影的具体的事物，“虚”是无形无影的抽象的事物。是不是世界上只有有形有影的事物存在呢？思想本身就是“虚”的东西，可是每个人都凭自己的经验知道思想是存在的。当然，思想也有正确和错误之分。神和鬼之类的观念是虚假的，它们并不是现实事物的如实反映，而是人们头脑中的幻觉。可是很多哲学上科学上的范畴或概念，例如“共性”“绝对”“可能性”“规律”“价值”“抽象劳动”等等，这些东西同样是眼看不见，手抓不着的东西，可是它们并不是假的。用这些范畴或者概念构成的理论也是这样。科学的概念、原理、规律、理论是无形无影的抽象的东西，但也是千真万确的东西，我们不能仅仅因为它们是无形无影的东西而怀疑它们的真理性，怀疑它们不是客观现实的反映。
    就目前的情况来说，把“务虚”的“虚”了解成“假”，这是极少数文化不高的同志的一种误会，更多的误解是把一切理论都看成是空洞的东西，没有什么实际用处。照有些人的看法，似乎不学习的同志总比爱学习的同志更务实，读小册子的同志总比“啃大部头”的同志更务实。所以，我们需要深入地看看虚与实的关系。
    “虚”和“实”是对立的统一。“实”就是实际情况，现实生活和实践，“虚”就是事物内部的本质和规律，就是反映这种本质和规律的思想、理论。本质和规律是支配现象的，思想认识是指导实践的。所以，虚和实不能分为两橛。我们的实践是改造客观世界，这就是我们讲的“务实”。但是要能成功地改造客观世界，就必须改造主观世界，这就是“务虚”。无产阶级的政党把千千万万人民的实践组织起来，以马列主义的理论为指南，结合当时当地的实际，领导人民进行改造客观世界的斗争，并且在改造客观世界的过程中改造自己的主观世界，这就是无产阶级的政治任务。党提倡务虚，就是提倡谈思想、谈理论、谈政治。政治是统帅，思想是灵魂，所以我们说应当“以虚率实”。
    虚在实中，虚应该不离实。我们说“实事求是”，“事”是“实”的是无疑了，“是”是什么呢？毛主席解释过，就是事物的内部联系，即规律性。那么“是”就是“虚”的了。但只要是“是”而不是“非”，那就是虚而不假。是不是“空”一些呢？这也要看怎么说。如果是教条主义地对待理论，把理论变成脱离实际的“无源之水”“无本之木”，那当然会空。这种空洞的理论是一点实际用处也没有的。但如果理论是从实际中来而又回到实际中去的，那它就会有丰富充实的内容，虽虚而不空。
  　所以，“务虚”这个名词固然很新鲜，而它所含的意思却是党一直强调的。一篇“实践论”，讲的是实践和认识的关系，也可以说是务实和务虚的关系。
    务虚是为了更好的务实。务虚务得好不好，就看务虚的实效如何。1958年吸取了1957年生产发展比较缓慢的经验教训，党中央提出了社会主义建设的总路线，提倡解放思想，破除迷信，敢想敢说敢干，干部和群众都大大务虚了一番，结果是收到了奇效，马列主义果然出粮食，出钢铁。可见，“虚”能够大大影响“实”，“虚”能够转化为“实”。列宁说，“人的意识不仅反映客观世界，并且创造客观世界”，由此可见务虚的重要性。
    务实而不务虚，其结果必然是务实也务不好，务不彻底。经验主义者、事务主义都是重务实轻务虚的人，但是他们常常看不到事物的本质，找不到工作的方向，因而工作也难于开展，得不到很大成效。过去有不少农民，平日很讲实际，不是亲身经验过的都不肯相信，但是一到生病的时候，却是求神拜佛，占卦算命，完全相信那些玄虚的东西了。为什么会这样呢？这正是由于他们务虚不够，不了解科学的道理。
    我们反对教条主义，但是要提倡读书。产生教条主义的原因并不是读书太多，而是务实不够，读书也不多。这是读书的目的和方法问题，不是要不要读书的问题。到现在还有不少人抱着这种观念，好像读书是件危险的事情，要读书，最好也是看点小册子，不能“啃大部头书”。甚至还有人认为，理论既然从实际中产生，那么有了实际就不必再学理论了，实际经验就是最丰富最高明的理论，这种人是重实轻虚，以实代虚。个人的实践经验是属于“实”的范畴，至于我们讲的“虚”，指的是理性认识。从感性经验上升到理性认识，这是一个质的飞跃，不是很简单的。毛主席曾经把这个过程概括成四句话，叫做：“去粗取精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里”。我个人的体会，“去粗取精”就是对事实材料作初步的选择，去掉那些不相干不重要的东西，留下有用处有价值的东西；“去伪存真”就是对这些材料作进一步的考察，鉴别哪些是不可靠不真实的，哪些是可靠的，真实的；“由此及彼”就是找出各种材料和问题的各方面的联系——起初是外部联系，进而是内部联系；这样，我们就从事情的外部表现深入到内部的本质，这就是“由表及里”了。这样得来的认识，才叫理性认识。所以，理论虽从实际来，但实际本身决不能代替理论。
    光务实而不务虚，表面上看来好像是十分重视实际，而其实是对实际没有认真对待。个人的实践经验，个人接触到的环境，总是比较狭隘的、片面的。我们不能只重视个人工作的“小实际”，而忽视了社会的“大实际”，不了解大局就不了解小局。理论本身虽不是实践，但它是从亿万人民长期的实践中总结出来的。从这一点看，我们也可以说“虚中有实”。这样的理论，能帮助我们正确地深刻地了解当前的周围的现实，能帮助我们更好地务实。
    反过来，务虚而不务实，务虚也一定务不好，当然更谈不上收实效。从去年毛主席提出务虚以后，许多机关重视理论学习，重视研究问题了，由于务虚，提高了工作，这是可喜的事情。可是也有些干部，成天谈思想，工作做得少，也不大深入实际，结果变成清谈了。这恐怕是值得注意的。离开实际情况、材料、经验，务虚也无从务起；情况和经验虽有而不足，务虚务到一定程度也会感到务不下去，茫无结果。看来在这个问题上有两种偏向：一是做了很多工作，情况和经验堆集了一大堆，可是很少加以分析、研究、总结，以致不能提高；一是情况经验并不多，只凭道听途说，片言只字，或浮光掠影的一点东西，没有深入调查研究，就哇啦哇啦，大发议论，结果当然会流于浮夸和空疏，有时争论来争论去，由于双方都没有足够的材料，争也争不出结果。所以，我们必须注意“就实论虚”。
    总而言之，我们一定要做到虚实并举。当然，这里也有分工，搞理论工作的人务虚的时间总要多一点，搞实际工作的人务实的时间也要多一点。但是，搞理论工作的人也要务实，不能一年四季坐在书房里，不能脱离现实的需要和实际材料而抽象地进行研究；搞实际工作的人也要务虚，不能不抽出一些时间来学习政策和理论，来研究问题，总结经验。务虚不务实，会成为空头政治家或教条主义的理论家；务实不务虚，会成为迷失方向的实际家或盲目的事务主义者。虚实结合，就实论虚，以虚率实，这才是正确的原则。
