Who Should Be Frank?
Shi Lü

At the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference on May 20th, U.S. Secretary of State Herter made a self-aggrandizing speech about the West's "package plan", and two other points were noteworthy. One was to conduct blatant blackmail, saying that "If developments here demonstrate reason to hold a summit meeting, then we would be willing to participate in a summit meeting, otherwise we will not participate," attempting to force the Soviet Union to accept the West's "package plan." The other was to insist that the Soviet Union's suggestion of concluding a peace treaty with Germany "actually demands that Germany be in a state of indefinite division," and that the Soviet Union should "best be frank" about why it "does not want Germany to be reunified."

Herter's words are both overt schemes and covert conspiracies. The Western "package plan" with its so-called "free elections," "disarmament measures," "Four-Power supervision of German unification," etc., are all stale tricks that Western countries have been using for years to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German question. This time, they are merely twisting all these rotten things into a dead knot and presenting them. To stick labels of "peace" and "concessions" on such goods, and to sell them at the Geneva conference for the Soviet Union and the German people to accept, is of course extremely difficult. Herter, who is skilled in business, cannot fail to understand this point, so he has to resort to blackmail. This is an overt scheme. But what if blackmail fails? So Herter set a trap in advance, attempting to shift the responsibility for the future breakdown of the conference onto the Soviet Union. This is a covert conspiracy.

However, whether overt or covert, Herter's plan is bound to fail. The United States' blackmail diplomacy has been going on for a long time. "Atomic blackmail" and "dollar blackmail" have both been thwarted. Now, adding a "conference blackmail" by saying "If we don't do this and that, we won't participate in a summit meeting," can hardly intimidate anyone. The only effect is to further expose the United States' deliberate sabotage of peace and unwillingness to resolve problems through negotiations.

As for the attempt to pin the responsibility for the failure of negotiations on the Soviet Union by using the German unification issue, it is also futile. Determining who wants to keep Germany in a state of indefinite division does not depend on who talks more or less about "unifying Germany," but on whose actual actions truly help promote German unification.

On the issue of German unification, there is a principle and a fact. The unification of Germany is Germany's internal affair. No foreign country can interfere in the affairs of the German people. This is a fundamental principle of international law that cannot be violated. On the territory of Germany, there are two Germanies developing in different directions. Before conditions are in place that could allow these two Germanies to approach each other, unification is just empty talk. This is an undeniable fact. According to all the past agreements of the Four Powers on the German issue, the Four Powers do not have the right to take over and manage Germany's unification, but they have the obligation to create conditions for the reunification of Germany. The Soviet Union's suggestion of concluding a peace treaty sufficient to ensure Germany's development towards a path of peace and democracy is precisely to create conditions for the reunification of Germany.

Today, the biggest obstacle preventing the two Germanies from approaching each other is the militarization of West Germany. Accepting the Soviet Union's suggestion can eliminate the danger of German militarization, promote the approach of the two Germanies, and achieve the goal of unifying Germany through the efforts of the German people themselves. Isn't this crystal clear? How can it be said that the Soviet Union's suggestion actually demands that Germany be in a state of indefinite division? On the contrary, according to Herter's incessant "package plan," a peace treaty will only be concluded after Germany is unified. Then, may I ask, where does this unification come from? Is it to be imposed on the German people by the Four Powers? The German people will not accept this insult of interfering in internal affairs, and the Soviet Union will never agree to participate in this act of interfering in other people's internal affairs. Are the two Germanies to seek a path to unification themselves? Without a peace treaty to prevent the militarization of West Germany, people cannot see any possibility of the two Germanies approaching each other, let alone achieving unification. Herter's "package plan" trumpets "unified Germany" here and "unified Germany" there, but the result is to make the unification of Germany fundamentally impossible. Isn't this also crystal clear? Herter said that the Soviet Union "actually demands that Germany be in a state of indefinite division," which is of course nonsense. However, if this is Herter's "self-description," it is the most appropriate thing.

Herter hopes that the Soviet Union will "best be frank" about its intentions, which shows that he advocates frankness. People cannot disagree with his proposition, because frankness is indeed a basic element of negotiation. At the same time, people also note that at the current Geneva conference, there are indeed people who are unwilling to frankly state their true intentions, but such people are neither representatives of the Soviet Union nor representatives of the German Democratic Republic.

    谁应该坦率？
    施旅
    在5月20日的日内瓦外长会议上，美国国务卿赫脱除了自吹自擂一通西方的“一揽子计划”之外，还有两点值得注意的地方。一是进行明目张胆的讹诈，说什么“如果这里的事态发展证明有理由举行最高级会议，那末我们将愿意参加最高级会议，否则就不参加”，企图以此来强迫苏联接受西方的“一揽子计划”。一是硬说苏联的缔结对德和约的建议“实际上是要求德国无限期地处于分裂状态”，要苏联“最好坦率地说出来”为什么“不希望德国重新统一”。
    赫脱的这些话，是阳谋，也是阴谋。西方“一揽子计划”里的什么“自由选举”、“裁军措施”、“四大国监督德国的统一”等等，都是西方国家过去若干年来为了阻挠德国问题的和平解决而搬弄烂了的东西，这次不过是把所有这些烂东西拧成死结端出来而已。要把这样的货色插上“和平”和“让步”的标签，在日内瓦会议上推销出去，要苏联、德国人民接受，当然是难乎其难，精于经商之道的赫脱不会不懂得这一点，于是只有诉诸讹诈一途了。这是阳谋。但是，万一讹诈不成又怎么办呢？于是赫脱又预先设下一个陷阱，企图把将来如果会议破裂的责任倒栽在苏联身上。这是阴谋。
    然而，明的也好，暗的也好，赫脱的打算是一定要破产的。美国的讹诈外交，是行之已久的了，什么“原子讹诈”，什么“金元讹诈”，都先后碰壁了，现在再加上一个“会议讹诈”，说什么“不如何如何就不参加最高级会议”又能吓倒谁呢？唯一的作用，就是更加暴露美国蓄意破坏和平，不想用谈判方式解决问题。
    至于用德国统一问题来把谈判不成的责任推到苏联头上的企图，也是枉然的。判明谁要使德国处于无限期的分裂状态，并不在于看谁把“统一德国”这句话讲得多些，谁讲得少些，而是要看谁的实际行动真正有助于促进德国的统一。
    在德国的统一问题上，存在着一个原则和一个事实。德国的统一是德国的内政。德国人民自己的事务，任何外国不能干涉。这是不容违反的国际法的基本原则。在德意志的领土上有着两个朝着不同方向发展的德国，在具备有使这两个德国可能互相接近的条件之前，统一只是空谈，这是不容抹煞的事实。根据四大国过去在有关德国问题上的一切协议，四大国没有越俎代庖而包办德国统一事业的权利，却有为重新统一德国创造条件的义务。苏联所建议的缔结一个足以保证德国向和平民主的道路发展的和约，正是为重新统一德国创造条件。
    今天妨碍两个德国互相接近的最大障碍就是西德的军国主义化。接受苏联的建议，就可以消除德国军国主义化的危险，就可以促进两个德国的接近，就可以由于德国人民自己的努力而达到统一德国的目的，这不是一清二楚的吗？怎么能说苏联的建议实际上是要求德国无限期地处于分裂状态呢？相反的，按照赫脱所喋喋不休的“一揽子计划”，要在德国统一之后才缔结和约，那么，试问这个统一从何而来？由四大国去强加在德国人民身上吗？德国人民不会接受这种对内政横加干涉的侮辱，苏联也决不会同意参加这种干涉别人内政的勾当。由两个德国自己去寻求统一的途径吗？在没有和约去制止西德军国主义化的情况下，人们看不出两个德国有接近的可能，更不要说达到统一了。赫脱鼓吹的“一揽子计划”中，左一个“统一德国”，右一个“统一德国”，结果都是使德国的统一成为根本不可能的事情，这难道不也是一清二楚的吗？赫脱说苏联“实际上是要求德国无限期地处于分裂状态”，这当然是无稽之谈；然而，如果说这是赫脱的“夫子自道”，却是最适合也不过的了。
    赫脱希望苏联把自己的意图“最好坦率地说出来”，可见他是主张坦率的。人们不能不同意他这一主张，因为坦率确实是进行谈判的一个基本要素。同时人们也注意到，在目前日内瓦的会议上，确实是有人不肯坦率地说出他的真正意图，但这样的人既不是苏联的代表，也不是德意志民主共和国的代表。
