Foreign News Abstract

    Iran Under U.S. Control
    Originally Published in "U.S. News & World Report" on May 11th
    Editor's Note: Recently, anti-American sentiment has been rising in Iran. At the end of March in Tabriz, Iran, an American soldier unreasonably beat an Iranian police officer, arousing public outrage. More than two thousand people demonstrated in front of the U.S. consulate, shouting: "Yankees go home!" Here is an excerpt from a report in "U.S. News & World Report," which also reveals the strong dissatisfaction of the Iranian people with the United States and its agents.

    The situation in oil-rich Iran is rapidly showing many signs of tension.

    U.S. aid is pouring into Iran to support the pro-Western government. More than three thousand American civilians work in the country, and the number of American military personnel working with Iranian forces is even greater. In every construction project, there are also American advisors and engineers.

    You only need to stay in this country for a few days to realize that the situation is not good. On the surface, there are no riots or anti-government demonstrations. The streets are calm. However, this calm is only an illusion.

    Just like in Iraq before the revolution last summer, here you can also feel that the general public is dissatisfied with the government. People are indignant about the corruption and decadence of high-ranking officials, complaining about the lack of democratic freedom and the huge gap between the rich and the poor. The basic factors for a revolution already exist, and no one would be surprised if a revolution breaks out soon.

    In this situation, the United States is providing the Iranian government with huge military and economic assistance. The United States has already given Iran $394.6 million in technical assistance, development loans, and grants. In addition, the United States has provided $250 million to train and equip Iranian forces. A country that was once within the British "sphere of influence" has now become an American "sphere of influence."

    Americans can be found everywhere in Iran. Even in the royal palace, you can encounter Americans in plain clothes walking around. These people are "technical advisors" to the King's court. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Tehran has its own radio station, broadcasting around the clock. Iranians who turn on the radio late at night will hear a loud American accent: "This is Tehran." Plans are currently underway to open a U.S. Air Force television broadcasting station.

    Among Iranians, many criticisms of Americans can be heard. The most common is that Americans have raised prices and rents, and that Americans live extravagantly. Indeed, many American officials have private swimming pools. People feel that the lives of Americans are too far removed from those of the locals.

    In the eyes of Iranians who oppose the King, the United States and the King are colluding. For example, the editor of an anti-King newspaper was punished by the King for attacking the United States. Directly attacking the King is of course not allowed, but this editor seems to have thought that as long as he attacked the Americans, readers would understand that his real target was the Americans' good friend—the King.

    Of course, the current situation in Iran is different from that in Iraq before the revolution. However, beneath the surface in Iran, there are still many boiling signs that could lead to an outbreak of unrest.

    The King himself has become more aware of domestic dissatisfaction and its possible consequences since the Iraqi revolution. The King has promulgated a large number of "reform" decrees. Since there is no opposition party within the parliament, the King has designated two parties as "opposition parties."

    All of this has not changed the deep-rooted dissatisfaction of the people. The living standards of most people remain very low. Many people miss the days when Mossadegh was in power (referring to the Mossadegh government that was in power from 1951 to 1953, which implemented a policy of nationalizing oil and was overthrown by a U.S.-orchestrated military coup – translator's note). Even those who opposed Mossadegh in those years say: "About Mossadegh, one thing you have to admit is that his government was the most honest government in Iranian history."

### 美国控制下的伊朗  原载五月十一日“美国新闻与世界报道”

专栏：外论摘要

    美国控制下的伊朗
    原载五月十一日“美国新闻与世界报道”
    编者按　近来伊朗人民反美情绪日益高涨，3月底在伊朗大不里士由于一名美国士兵无理殴打伊朗警官，激起群众公愤，有两千多群众在美国领事馆前示威，高呼：“美国佬滚回家去。”这里摘载“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的一篇报道，也透露了伊朗人民对于美国及其代理人的强烈不满情绪。
    盛产石油的伊朗国内局势，正在迅速出现许多紧张的迹象。
    美援正在涌入伊朗，以支持亲西方的政府。在这个国家里工作的美国文职人员三千多人，在伊朗部队工作的美国军人数目更多。在每一项建设项目中，也都有美国顾问和工程人员。
    你只要在这个国家逗留几天，就会发现情况不妙了。表面上，没有骚乱，没有反政府的示威。街道平静。但是，这种平静只是假象。
    就像在去年夏天革命前的伊拉克一样，在这里你也会感觉到一般人是对政府不满的。人们对于达官显贵的腐败堕落愤愤不平，抱怨没有民主自由、贫富之间生活悬殊。产生革命的基本因素都已经存在了，假如不久以后爆发革命，谁也不会很惊异的。
    在这种情况下，美国正在给予伊朗政府巨大的军事经济援助。美国已经给予伊朗三亿九千四百六十万美元技术援助、发展贷款和赠予。此外，美国又提供了二亿五千万美元训练和装备伊朗部队。一个一度是英国“势力范围”之内的国家，现在已经变成美国的“势力范围”了。
    在伊朗，到处都可以发现美国人。甚至在皇宫里，也会碰到穿着便服的美国人到处走动。这些人是国王宫廷的“技术顾问”。驻德黑兰的美国空军，有自己的广播电台，二十四小时通宵广播。伊朗人深夜打开收音机就会听到宏亮的美国口音：“这是德黑兰”。目前正在计划开设美国空军电视广播台。
    在伊朗人之间，可以听到许多对美国人的批评。最普通的是美国人抬高了物价和房租，美国人生活奢华。诚然，许多美国官员都有私人游泳池。人们都感到美国人的生活和本地人相距太远。
    在反对国王的伊朗人的心目中，美国和国王是串通一气的。例如，一家反国王的报纸编辑由于攻击美国，就受到了国王的惩办。直接攻击国王当然是不允许的，但是这位编辑似乎以为，只要攻击美国人，读者便会明白，他的真正目标是美国人的好朋友——国王。
    自然，伊朗目前情况和革命以前的伊拉克的情况有所不同。但是，在伊朗的表象下面仍有许多沸腾的迹象，可能导致爆发一场骚动。
    国王自己自从伊拉克革命以后已经更加认识到国内的不满及其可能产生的结果。国王颁布了一大堆“改革”法令。议会内部没有反对党，国王就指定了两个政党做“反对党”。
    这一切并没有能改变人们根深蒂固的不满情绪。大多数人民生活水平仍然很低。许多人都怀念摩萨台当政的那些日子（指1951—1953年执政的摩萨台政府，这个政府实行石油国有化政策，被美国策划的军事政变所颠覆——译者注）。甚至在当年反对摩萨台的人都说：“关于摩萨台，有一件事你得承认，那就是他的政府是伊朗有史以来最诚实的政府”。
