Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 16th, requiring all regions to strengthen organizational leadership, earnestly mobilize the masses, and do a good job in selecting and reserving seeds for summer harvest crops.

The notice stated that the summer harvest season is approaching. Doing a good job in selecting and reserving seeds during the summer harvest is an important preparatory work for striving for a greater harvest next year, and it is also a fundamental measure for implementing the policy of self-selection, self-propagation, self-retention, and self-use of seeds. Therefore, all regions should organize people's communes to start early, make proper arrangements, and earnestly do this work well.

The notice required: For all summer harvested crops, all regions should formulate a seed selection and retention plan based on the needs of the next quarter or next year's planting plan and planting density, and make arrangements early to select and reserve enough seeds. In order to prevent natural disasters or seed shortages due to temporary changes in production plans, a certain amount of reserve seeds should also be selected and retained. Seeds selected and retained by provinces, prefectures, counties, and cities for mutual adjustment or expansion of planting should also be arranged early. The seeds selected and retained should be as dry, clean, pure, and full as possible.

Regarding the method of selecting and retaining seeds, for those that have established seed plots (fields), field inspections must be carried out before harvesting to remove mixed plants. Before harvesting, in addition to selecting some ears (plants) for planting in seed plots (fields) in the next season or next year, the rest should be harvested, threshed, and stored separately for planting in large fields; those who have not established seed plots (fields) can combine the work of yield comparison, yield survey, and good variety identification before harvesting, select plots with higher purity, timely sowing, uniform growth, and fewer diseases and pests, process and manage them, remove impurities and inferior ones, and retain them for seed use. In terms of labor organization, the selection and retention work that already has professional organizations should be carried out by them; those who have not established specialized organizations can also organize temporary seed selection teams (groups) within the production team according to the situation, and let them be responsible for selecting and retaining enough seeds.

The notice stated that while selecting and retaining seeds, the evaluation of farmer's good varieties can also be carried out according to different situations. In areas where good varieties have not been popularized, experienced old farmers and young activists should be organized to evaluate farmer's good varieties through field observation, discussions, and other methods, in order to accelerate the propagation and promotion of good varieties; in areas where good varieties have been basically popularized, attention should be paid to selecting new good varieties with higher yields, better quality, resistance to diseases and pests, and suitable for local farming systems, and attention should be paid to the rational combination of varieties to prevent variety homogenization.

The notice pointed out: With the changes in production conditions such as water, fertilizer, soil, and density, more new good varieties with large ears, many grains, and strong stress resistance are needed. In order to gradually meet this need, during the summer harvest season, all regions should mobilize experienced commune members and the commune's agricultural scientific research units, in conjunction with field management, pay attention to discovering and selecting single plants and single ears with large ears, many grains, heavy grains, resistance to lodging, and special excellent characteristics, harvest them separately, plant them separately, process and cultivate them, and carefully observe and compare them. This is a method for the masses to cultivate new varieties that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and all regions should pay special attention to it.

When talking about seed storage, the notice pointed out: Each commune needs many varieties of seeds and a large quantity, so storage work is particularly important. People's communes with conditions should try their best to assign special personnel to store them by variety; have special seed warehouses, establish necessary storage systems, and regularly check and turn them over to prevent mixing and mildew.

### 选好留足夏收作物新良种  农业部通知各地发动群众做好选种工作

    选好留足夏收作物新良种
    农业部通知各地发动群众做好选种工作
    新华社17日讯　农业部16日发出通知，要求各地加强组织领导，认真发动群众，作好夏收作物选种留种工作。
    通知说，夏收季节即将到来，在夏收中作好选种留种工作，是争取明年更大丰收的重要准备工作之一，又是贯彻种子自选、自繁、自留、自用方针的根本措施，因此，各地应该组织人民公社及早动手，妥善安排，切实做好这一工作。
    通知要求：凡是夏季收获的作物，各地都应根据下一季度或下年播种计划和密植程度的需要，制定选种留种计划，并且及早安排，选好留足。为了预防自然灾害或因生产计划临时改变而发生缺种少种情况，还应适当多选留一部分后备种子。省、专、县、市为了相互调剂或扩种所需要的种子也应及早安排。选留的种子，要尽量做到干、净、纯、饱。
    在选留种子的方法上，对已建立种子地（田）的，收获前须进行田间检验，除去杂株。在收获前除了穗选（株选）一部分供作下季或下年种子地（田）播种的种子外，其余单收、单打、单藏留作大田播种；没有建立种子地（田）的在收获前可以结合丰产评比、产量调查、良种鉴评等工作，选择纯度较高、播种适时、生长整齐、病虫害少的地块，加工管理，去杂去劣后，留作种用。在劳动力的组织方面，已经有专业组织的选种留种工作由他们负责进行；没有建立专门组织的，也可根据情况在生产队内组织临时的选种队（组），由其包干负责选好留够。
    通知说，在选种留种的同时，也可根据不同情况分别进行农家良种的评选工作。在良种没有普及地区要组织有经验的老农和青年积极分子通过田间观察、座谈等方式，评选农家良种，以加速良种繁殖推广；良种已经基本普及的地区，要注意评选产量更高，质量更好，抵抗病虫害而又适合当地耕作制度的新的良种，并注意品种的合理搭配，防止品种单一化。
    通知指出：随着水、肥、土、密等生产条件的改变，需要更多的穗大、粒多、抗逆力强的新良种。为了逐步满足这个需要，在夏收季节，各地要发动有经验的社员和公社的农业科学研究单位，结合田间管理，注意发现选拔穗大、粒多、粒重、抗倒伏和具有特殊优良特性的单株单穗，单独收获，单独种植，加工培育，仔细观察比较，这是群众性培育新品种多、快、好、省的方法，各地应加以特别重视。
    通知在谈到种子保管时指出：每个公社需要的种子，品种多、数量大，保管工作就显得特别重要。凡有条件的人民公社，要尽可能作到指定专人，分品种储藏；有专门的种子仓库，建立必要的保管制度，定期检查翻晒，严防混杂、霉烂。（附图片）
