    The Large Estate System in Cuba
    Editor's Note: The Cuban government recently promulgated a land reform law to abolish the large estate system. It also recently decided to postpone the land reform of large sugarcane plantations for one year. The Cuban People's Socialist Party's organ "Hoy" published an article on May 5 describing the situation of land concentration and the large estate system in Cuba. Excerpts are translated below.
    According to the 1946 agricultural survey, the total number of farm households in Cuba in that year was 159,958, owning 676,385 caballerías of land (each caballería is equal to 13.43 hectares).
      62,500 farm households, accounting for 39% of the total number of farm households, had less than three-quarters of a caballería of land. These farm households only had 22,112 caballerías of land, accounting for 3.3% of the total amount of land owned by farm households nationwide.
    However, 894 large farm households, accounting for 0.5% of the total number of farm households, possessed 243,003 caballerías of land, accounting for 36% of all land owned by farm households nationwide.
    Less than 1% of farm households owned more than one-third of the land; while more than one-third of the total number of farm households owned only 3.3% of the land.
    Large estate owners—a large proportion of whom are foreign companies—controlled most of Cuba's fertile land.
    The "Cuban-American Sugar Company" occupied 10,440 caballerías of land, a figure it announced itself, almost all in Oriente Province, which is larger than the area of ninety-six of Cuba's one hundred and twenty-six municipalities. The American livestock monopoly "King Ranch" occupies land larger than the area of Oriente and Camagüey Provinces combined.
  The large estate system is particularly manifested in the sugar industry.
    Twenty-three American sugar companies own thirty-nine sugar mills; they own a total of 72,008 caballerías of land, and have 36,000 caballerías of land rented or used under contract. A total of 108,008 caballerías, an area larger than the entire province of Pinar del Río by 8,000 caballerías.
    Almost half of Cuba's arable land (47%) is controlled by less than two thousand large estate owners. This allows them to offer farmers prices that farmers simply cannot afford, making it impossible for almost all farmers to become landowners, thereby freeing them from exploitation by the large estate owners.
    The large estate system is the fundamental reason why Cuban farmers lack land. The large estate owners take advantage of the fact that most farmers lack land to exploit many of them through the sharecropping system. This land cultivation system is a remnant of the feudal era, where farmers are the "slaves" of the landlords. Through this system, farmers have to hand over a quarter, a third, or even half of their harvest to the landowners, who get rich by exploiting the labor of sharecropping farmers.
    For farmers, the large estate system means poverty, disease, ignorance, and hunger; not only that, but it also harms agriculture, national industry and commerce, workers, professionals, and the general petty bourgeoisie.

### 古巴的大庄园制度

专栏：外论摘要

    古巴的大庄园制度
    编者按　古巴政府最近颁布土地改革法，废除大庄园制度。日前又决定对大甘蔗种植园的土地改革推迟一年。古巴人民社会党机关报“今日报”5月5日发表了一篇文章说明了古巴土地集中和大庄园制度的情况，现摘译如下。
    根据1946年的农业调查，古巴的农户总数在这一年共有十五万九千九百五十八户，拥有六十七万六千三百八十五卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚合13.43公顷）的土地。
      不到四分之三卡瓦耶里亚土地的农户有六万二千五百户即，占农户总数39％。而上述这些农户只有二万二千一百一十二卡瓦耶里亚的土地，占全国农户拥有土地总额的3.3％。
    然而，占总农户0.5％的八百九十四个大农户却占有二十四万三千零三卡瓦耶里亚土地，即占全国农户所有土地的36％。
    不到1％的农户占有三分之一以上的土地；而超过农户总数三分之一的农户仅仅拥有3.3％的土地。
    大庄园主——很大一部分是外国公司——控制了古巴的大部分肥沃的土地。
    “古—美糖公司”占有一万零四百四十卡瓦耶里亚土地，这是它自己宣布的数字，几乎全部在奥连特省，比古巴的一百二十六个市中的九十六个市的面积都大。美国畜牧业垄断组织“金氏牧场”占有比奥连特省和卡马圭省面积还大的土地。
  大庄园制特别表现在制糖工业方面。
    二十三个美国糖公司占有三十九个糖厂；总共占有七万二千零八卡瓦耶里亚土地，并有租田或根据合同使用的土地三万六千卡瓦耶里亚。共计十万八千零八卡瓦耶里亚，这个面积较比那尔德里奥省全省面积还多八千卡瓦耶里亚。
    古巴几乎一半的耕地（47％）被不到两千个大庄园主控制着。这就使他们得以对农民提出农民根本拿不出的价格，使几乎全部农民不可能成为土地的所有者，从而摆脱他们遭到大庄园主的剥削。
    大庄园制是古巴农民缺少土地的基本原因。大庄园主利用大部分农民缺少土地的情况通过伙种制度来剥削其中的很多人。这种土地耕种制是封建时代的残余，在这里农民是地主的“奴隶”。通过这种制度，农民不得不把四分之一、三分之一、甚至二分之一的收成交给土地所有者，他们靠伙种农民的劳动发财致富。
    大庄园制对农民来说就是贫困、疾病、无知和饥饿；不仅如此，而且它也危害了农业、民族工商业、工人、自由职业者和一般小资产阶级。
