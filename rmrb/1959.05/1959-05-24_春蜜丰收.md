    Spring Honey Harvest
    In Conghua County, Guangdong Province, the Jiangpu People's Commune's 3,000 colonies of native bees had already collected 130,000 jin of lychee honey and propagated 2,500 bee colonies by the end of April. It is estimated that two more honey harvests can be taken by the end of the lychee flowering season.
    The Xiangtang Bee Farm in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, has increased its 3,000 colonies of Italian bees to over 9,200 colonies by the "May Day" holiday, an increase of more than twofold. During the Chinese milk vetch flowering season, the farm organized 1,600 honey-collecting groups, and the first honey harvest yielded 32,000 jin. It is expected that two to three more honey harvests can be taken.
    This spring, the Hangzhou Bee Farm in Zhejiang Province had 1,009 colonies of Italian bees. As of April 24th, they had collected 36,000 jin of honey. It is estimated that the average honey production per colony will exceed 50 jin by the time the Chinese milk vetch flowers fade.
    In Nanhui County, Shanghai, the 4,247 colonies of Italian bees had produced 130,000 jin of honey by the end of April, averaging 30 jin per colony. The highest-yielding units produced 80 jin per colony. It is estimated that the total output by the end of the Chinese milk vetch flowering season will increase by 155% compared to the same period in 1958.

    浙江省杭州市养蜂场今春有一千零九群意大利蜂，到4月24日止已取蜜三万六千斤，预计到紫云英花谢时，平均每群产蜜五十斤以上。
    上海市南汇县的四千二百四十七群意大利蜂，到4月底止，已产蜂蜜十三万斤，平均每群产三十斤，最高单位产量八十斤，预计到紫云英流蜜期结束时，总产量可比1958年同期增长155％。
