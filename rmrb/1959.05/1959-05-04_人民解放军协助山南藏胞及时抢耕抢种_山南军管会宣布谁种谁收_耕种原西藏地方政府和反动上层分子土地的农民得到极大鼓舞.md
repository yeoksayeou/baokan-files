Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa. The People's Liberation Army in the Shannan Zetang area and the Shannan Military Control Commission have been providing relief to the broad masses of Tibetan compatriots who have suffered from the atrocities of the rebel bandits, and helping them with timely spring ploughing and sowing.

After the People's Liberation Army swept through the Shannan area, eliminating the bandits, the Shannan Military Control Commission sent out more than a dozen work teams, together with the PLA, to go deep into various areas to conduct propaganda among the masses, employing a "work-for-relief" method to help unemployed people find jobs, and providing relief and treatment to impoverished people and the sick and wounded. In Nedong Zong and Zetang urban area alone, more than 500 people were employed and received relief, and more than 500 wounded and sick people who had been injured by the rebel bandits or were unable to receive treatment due to the rebel bandit occupation received treatment. The Zetang Health Clinic recently transferred a group of medical personnel to Qonggyai, Gonggar, and Jedexiu and other places to treat the masses.

At the same time, the PLA and the Military Control Commission separately convened mass meetings to organize the masses for spring ploughing and production, and many Zong and Xi successively established anti-rebellion production committees. The day after the rebel bandits occupying Nedong Zong were eliminated, the Military Control Commission organized more than 300 people from the masses and cadres from organs and troops to repair a water dam that had been destroyed by the rebel bandits. For many farmers whose cattle had been snatched away by the rebel bandits, the work team led the masses to adopt mutual aid methods to help solve the difficulty of insufficient cattle. The PLA troops stationed in Nedong, Changzhu, and other places, in addition to helping Tibetan farmers repair irrigation ditches and deliver manure, also provided military horses to farmers for spring ploughing, and taught farmers how to use horses to plow and operate new-style walking plows. The interest-free agricultural loans issued by the Military Control Commission were more extensive and larger in quantity than last year, helping poor farmers solve the problem of seeds in a timely manner.

With the dissolution of the reactionary Tibetan local government, the heavy corvée labor and Ula that weighed on the Tibetan people were gone, the whips that supervised their labor were gone, and the Military Control Commission also announced, according to the urgent demands of the broad masses of farmers, that whoever cultivates the land formerly belonging to the Tibetan local government and reactionary upper-class elements this year will own the harvest. These changes and measures have brought great encouragement to the Tibetan farmers in the Shannan area. The thirty-six households in the Kaisukha estate were originally serfs of the reactionary chieftain Sokang, and they had to hand over the income from 500 ke of seeds every year to the serf owner from the 800 ke of seeds land they cultivated. Now they have automatically organized all their labor force into four groups to jointly cultivate all the land. The Qonggyai Zong Production Committee proposed that, while actively supporting the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion, the entire Zong would ensure that not an inch of land would be left uncultivated, and strive to achieve a bumper harvest.

Due to the high morale of the farmers, although the spring ploughing in the Shannan area was delayed by about half a month compared with previous years due to the disturbance by the rebel bandits, the entire sowing period was not prolonged. At present, in the various river valleys and plains south of the Yarlung Zangbo River, all the canals are being renovated, and groups of people are delivering manure and sowing seeds in the fields. Early-sown crops such as peas, wheat, and rapeseed have already grown tender green seedlings.

    山南军管会宣布谁种谁收
    耕种原西藏地方政府和反动上层分子土地的农民得到极大鼓舞
    新华社拉萨电　在山南泽当地区的人民解放军和山南军事管制委员会，对遭受叛匪残害的广大藏胞进行了救济，并帮助他们及时抢耕抢种。
    在扫荡盘据山南地区叛匪的大军过境之后，山南军管会便派出了十几个工作组和解放军一起，深入各地向群众进行宣传，采用以工代赈办法帮助失业的人就业，对贫苦群众和病、伤人员作了救济和治疗。仅乃东宗和泽当市区得到就业和救济的就有五百多人，被叛匪打伤或因叛匪盘据无法受到治疗的五百多个伤、病人得到了治疗。泽当卫生院最近又调出一批医务人员分赴琼结、贡噶、杰得秀等地为群众治病。
    在这同时，解放军和军管会还分别召集了群众会议，组织群众春耕生产，许多宗、溪还相继成立了平叛生产委员会。在盘据乃东宗的叛匪被消灭的第二天，军管会就组织群众和机关、部队的干部三百多人，修复了被叛匪破坏的一座拦水坝。对许多被叛匪抢去耕牛的农户，工作组领导群众采用互助办法，帮助解决耕牛不足的困难。驻在乃东、昌珠等地的解放军，除帮助藏族农民修水渠、送粪外，还把军马抽给农民春耕，并教给农民使用马匹犁地和操作新式步犁。军管会发放的无息农贷，比去年面广了，数量也大为增多，帮助贫困的农民及时解决了种子。
    随着反动的西藏地方政府的被解散，压在藏族人民头上的繁重的差役、乌拉没有了，监督他们劳动的鞭子没有了，军管会还根据广大农民的迫切要求，宣布凡是耕种原西藏地方政府和反动上层分子的土地，今年谁种谁收，这些变化和措施，给山南地区的藏族农民带来了极大的鼓舞。开苏溪卡的三十六户农民原是反动头子索康的农奴，他们耕种的八百克种子地，每年要以五百克种子地的收入交给农奴主。现在他们自动把所有劳动力组织起来分成四个小组，共同耕种所有的土地。琼结宗生产委员会提出，在积极支援人民解放军平叛的同时，全宗保证不荒芜一寸土地，争取获得大丰收。
    由于农民情绪的高涨，山南地区的春耕虽因叛匪据扰比往年推迟了半个月左右，但是整个播种期并没有延长。目前雅鲁藏布江南面的各个河谷平原，所有的渠道都在整修，成群的人在地里送粪、播种，豌豆、小麦、油菜等早播作物，有的已长出嫩绿幼苗。
