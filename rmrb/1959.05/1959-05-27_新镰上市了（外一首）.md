    New Scythes Are on the Market (and another poem)
     Tian Qi
	New scythes are on the market,
	Commune members smile in their hearts,
	The wheat is strong, so a quick scythe is needed to harvest,
	The sharpening stones in the production team are calling.
	The scythe blade is strong and good,
	The commune members' enthusiasm is high,
	The blade is as thin as paper and as bright as a mirror,
	The wheat is as thick as reeds, falling in the wind.

    Hauling Wheat
	Girls carry the wheat,
	Young men load it,
	A rustling of wheat ears,
	Faces glistening with sweat.
	The wheat is fragrant,
	The sweat is even more fragrant,
	Sweat sprinkles on her face,
	As if honey is sprinkled on her heart.
	Girls look at the young men,
	Young men glance at the girls,
	Ears listen to the crack of the whip,
	The young men's thoughts are on the tip of the whip.

    新镰上市了（外一首）
     田奇新镰上市了，社员心里笑，麦壮就得快镰割，生产队里磨石叫。镰刃钢劲好，社员干劲高，刃薄如纸明如镜，麦如苇粗迎风倒。
    运麦姑娘们扛，小伙子装，一片麦穗沙沙响，一脸汗水发亮光。麦子香，汗更香，汗水洒在她脸上，好像心上洒蜜糖。姑娘看小伙，小伙瞅姑娘，耳听鞭子响，小伙心思在鞭梢上。
