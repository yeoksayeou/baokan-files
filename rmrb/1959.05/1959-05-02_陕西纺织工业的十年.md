Comrade Fu Daoshen's Speech
Chairman, esteemed members:

    I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and am willing to implement it in my work. I also fully endorse Vice Chairman Li Weihan's Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC and the reports of other leaders.

    Moribund Before Liberation

    I have been engaged in the textile industry for more than 30 years. Recalling the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism before liberation, China's textile industry was on its last breath and extremely backward. At that time, the pseudo-government planned to build a yarn factory with 2,000 spindles in Xi'an, but after several years of preparation, it failed to do so. They simply did not care about the interests of the people. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government cared about the people's livelihood and vigorously developed industry, especially designating the Shaanxi region as one of the key construction bases for the national textile industry, thus fundamentally changing the backward face of the Shaanxi textile industry and creating a new situation of vigorous development. At the same time, from the grand occasion of the development of the textile industry in Shaanxi Province, we can also see the grand occasion of the development of various construction undertakings throughout the country. Now I would like to give a brief report to the comrades at the conference on the development of the textile industry in Shaanxi Province over the past ten years and some of my own experiences.

    Before liberation, most of the textile factories in the country were concentrated along the coast. More than 80 percent of the cotton produced in the Guanzhong Plain of Shaanxi had to be transported to the coastal areas for spinning and weaving. The vast number of cotton-producing farmers, after years of hard work, could not afford to wear machine-woven fine cloth clothes. When selling cotton, cotton farmers, like other agricultural crops, were also subject to the exploitation of bureaucratic bourgeoisie who suppressed grades and prices. At that time, farmers sometimes could not exchange a picul of cotton for a bolt of white cotton cloth. Therefore, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was very low. The average yield of lint cotton per mu in 1946, the highest year, was only 30 jin, and the lowest was reduced to 11 jin. The total cotton output in the province was no more than about one million dan. At that time, Shaanxi had almost no modern industry, and it was truly "poor and blank." The textile industry was also very inadequate. In 1949, there were only five textile factories in the province, with a total of only 88,300 spindles and only 1,300 ordinary looms. The machines were old, the equipment was simple, the management was backward, and the efficiency was low. As for the workers' welfare and labor protection, it was out of the question before liberation.

    Prospering After Liberation

    After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, and under the principle of concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry and correspondingly developing light industry and simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the textile industry in Shaanxi has made great progress, and the original backward face has now been completely changed. From 1952 to this year, almost every year a new large-scale textile factory has been built. As early as the three-year recovery period, in the summer of 1951, the state began to prepare for the construction of the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 in Xianyang. From civil engineering, installation to formal production, it was completed in only eleven months. Not only was the scale the newest and largest at that time, but all the equipment was manufactured by our own country. Subsequently, the state successively built seven large-scale new cotton textile factories in the Guanzhong area. Up to now, the province has put into production more than 630,000 cotton spindles, more than 27,000 thread spindles, and more than 15,000 automatic looms. These factories were all designed and built by ourselves under the direct guidance of the Central Ministry of Textile Industry and the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, with the help of Soviet experts and with the strong support of fraternal regions across the country. These new cotton textile factories are better equipped and built faster than each other. The largest is the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, with more than 100,000 spindles, more than 3,200 automatic looms, and more than 26,000 thread spindles; the formal construction of the factory took only one year. The scale of the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4 alone is more than the total of the factories built in Shaanxi Province before liberation. It is precisely because of the rapid construction of these state-owned enterprises that the leading position of the socialist economic component in the national economic field has been rapidly consolidated. This not only accelerated socialist industrial construction, but also promoted the socialist transformation of private enterprises. In the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956, the state merged 55 small weaving factories into seven factories with a certain scale and technical conditions. After the merger and joint operation of many small weaving factories, relying on collective strength and mass wisdom, they quickly transformed some of the foot-operated hand-cranked looms that had been circulating for hundreds of years into electric motor-driven ones. The result of socialist transformation greatly encouraged the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the workers and masses in these factories. The level of production technology and business management has been significantly improved compared with the past, and a prosperous new situation has emerged. Over the past ten years, as a result of new construction, expansion, and reconstruction, the province currently has more than eight times more new cotton textile machinery and equipment than in the early days of liberation. Modern equipped printing and dyeing finishing factories, there were none in this province in the past. Most of the cotton cloth produced, except for a small part dyed by local methods, had to be sent to other places for printing and dyeing processing, which increased round-trip transportation costs and costs. Since 1952, the new Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory with an annual output of one million pieces of colored cloth has been built in the suburbs of Xi'an, and the Northwest First Printing and Dyeing Factory with an annual output of three million pieces of cloth has been built this year, making the cotton cloth in this province begin to appear in a variety of colors and as beautiful as flowers. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the ever-increasing living standards, people's requirements for textiles are also higher. In the past, the textiles needed in the Shaanxi area mainly relied on supplies from other places. Now, the textiles in this province not only supply the needs of the people in the Northwest, but also sell to many provinces across the country. Many cotton textiles such as towels and bed sheets are also welcomed by the international market. The textile workers in Shaanxi all realize that the ability of our country's textiles to be sold abroad not only has great economic significance, but also has great political significance. It is a very glorious thing to be able to shine for the socialist motherland in the international market.

    Expanded Workforce, Improved Technical Level

    With the continuous construction of new factories, the ranks of textile workers are rapidly expanding and growing. In 1949, there were only 8,000 textile workers in the province, and now there is a textile team of more than 73,000 people. At the same time, under the correct leadership and frequent education of the Party, the workers' political awareness and technical level have been greatly improved. In 1958 alone, during the Great Leap Forward, a total of 7,303 advanced producers were selected in the province's textile industry, accounting for about 10 percent of the total number of employees, of which 654 were selected as advanced producers for several consecutive years. They created many moving deeds in production and labor. At the same time, the masses of employees put forward a constant stream of rationalization proposals and inventions. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 5,835 technical innovation proposals and rationalization proposals that can be calculated in value were made throughout the year, of which 1,146 were major projects, creating a lot of wealth for the country. Over the past ten years, the production level has been significantly improved. The hourly output per thousand spindles of cotton yarn was only 15.48 kg in 1949, and now it has increased to 30.64 kg. The output per loom per hour during the same period increased from 2.717 meters to more than 4.8 meters. The output of almost every spindle and every loom has increased by nearly double compared with the past. The ability of workers to watch spindles and watch looms has also increased by one to two times compared with the past.

    In recent years, while increasing production, various factories have made great efforts to improve quality and increase variety, and have achieved rapid progress. In 1949, factories in Shaanxi could only produce medium-count yarn and coarse-count yarn, and weave some coarse cloth and market cloth. The quality was poor and the variety was very monotonous. Now the province's cotton yarn ranges from 6 count yarn to 46 count yarn. Some factories have also successfully trial-spun 60 count fine yarn using the province's long-staple cotton. Cotton cloth not only includes market cloth and twill cloth, but also includes fine cloth, gabardine, serge, rainproof khaki, and poplin. Many small factories have also produced new products such as blue checkered cloth, flash wool, brocade wool, jacquard cloth, and corduroy. Printing and dyeing factories and knitting reproduction factories also continue to innovate varieties and create new patterns. The peacock opening screen, printed corduroy, scented flower cloth, discharge towels, and jacquard towel quilts produced are very popular among consumers. Especially in 1958, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, the textile workers of the province successively launched three campaigns to fight for 40 days, 100 days, and 70 days. Because they relied on the leadership of the Party, adhered to putting politics in command, mobilized the masses, and constantly liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and overcame right-leaning conservative ideas, a large part of the quality of yarn, cloth, printing and dyeing, and knitting reproduction products in the province competed for the top level in the country. The varieties increased to more than 500, of which more than 50 major products reached the domestic advanced level, and more than 20 reached the export requirements.

    In terms of technical level, various factories in Shaanxi have also improved year by year. For example, the Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 created a new national record of reducing the end breakage rate per thousand spindles of fine yarn from 168 to 76 in less than a year after it was formally put into production, and won the honorary title of National Model Spinning Factory in 1953. Subsequently, many factories also created the latest record of the end breakage of fine yarn not exceeding its count number. After the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3 started production, it paid attention to the daily basic technical management work, so that the amount of shuttle used per 10,000 meters of cloth created a national record of 0.157. The new Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory successfully tested the double-headed sulfurized blue pad dyeing, which increased the daily output from 1,500 pieces to 3,000 pieces. The Northwest First Printing and Dyeing Factory also successfully tested hydrogen peroxide bleaching during trial production, which shortened the time of the boiling and bleaching process from the original 40 hours to 5 hours, and improved the quality and reduced the cost. After comprehensive promotion, the production level of this factory can be increased by more than double the original design level. With the rapid improvement of production technology level, labor productivity is also increasing rapidly. In 1958, the labor productivity of each worker increased by nearly three times compared with 1949.

    Mass Movement Surging Higher and Higher

    Through vigorously carrying out mass movements, textile factories in Shaanxi have not only achieved a leap forward in production, but also made great gains politically and ideologically. In particular, after the various factories conscientiously implemented the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," many cadres participated in labor, ate, lived, and worked with the workers, and initially realized the principle of going to the masses to lead the masses and going to production to lead production, which closely linked them with the masses. After the workers participated in management, they greatly enhanced their sense of responsibility as masters and effectively improved the enterprise management work. The reason why the textile industry in Shaanxi Province was able to effectively break through some key production technologies and make preliminary experimental successes in the improvement of seven cutting-edge technologies and twelve major technologies last year was because it adhered to putting politics in command and realized the three-way combination of workers, leading cadres, and technical personnel. Therefore, all factories in the province have been able to frequently overcome all difficulties in the production process, so that the mass movement centered on high yield and high quality and comprehensively implementing "four highs and four savings" is surging higher and higher and constantly moving forward.

    While developing production, the Party and the state also attach great importance to the lives and welfare of textile workers. New factories take meticulous care of the workers' working conditions, material and cultural life, and maintain the health and safety of employees in the design and construction of factories. The production plant is surrounded by a living area, with employee lounges, women's hygiene rooms, canteens, reading rooms, bathhouses, etc. There are ventilation and cooling equipment in the factory to adjust the temperature and humidity so that the workshop climate is "spring all year round." All machines are equipped with safety protection devices. Other facilities such as employee dormitories, nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals, amateur schools, and sports and recreational activities are all available in various factories, which are vastly different from before liberation.

    A Major Event Related to the Worker-Peasant Alliance

    The fact that the textile industry in Shaanxi has been able to develop greatly in just a few years fully demonstrates the correctness of the Party's policies and also proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, only in our socialist country, can the working people be the masters of their own affairs and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to achieve such great achievements. At the same time, the development of the textile industry in Shaanxi is inseparable from the support of the vast number of farmers. Over the past ten years, the cotton in Shaanxi has greatly improved in both output and quality. The yield of lint cotton per mu increased from 30 jin in 1949 to 47 jin in 1957. In the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the yield of cotton per mu created a new record of 100 jin. Not only has the output increased, but the fiber quality has also improved. Now the farmers are working hard to improve cultivation techniques, actively adopt excellent varieties, and strive for higher and better harvests. This provides abundant and favorable material conditions for the leap-forward development of the cotton textile industry. In addition to the cotton-producing Guanzhong Plain, there are also vast pastures in the Yulin area of northern Shaanxi. In the fields where "the wind blows the grass low and the cattle and sheep are visible," the output and quality of wool have greatly improved in recent years. In Ankang in southern Shaanxi and Qingjian in northern Shaanxi, the mountains and sunny slopes are covered with mulberry trees, and the silk production is also very rich. According to preliminary investigations, the annual output of various wild fibers is more than one million dan. These provide abundant resources for the development of wool, hemp, silk and other textile enterprises.

    In order to further meet the people's needs for textiles, the textile industry in Shaanxi will have even greater development in the future. New textile enterprises will be built one after another. It can be definitely pointed out that the development prospects of the textile industry in Shaanxi are incomparably bright and splendid. The textile workers unanimously realize that the high-speed development of the textile industry is a major event related to the people's clothing, a major event related to the worker-peasant alliance, and a major event related to accumulating funds for the country's construction. Therefore, we are all full of confidence and are fighting for the high-speed development of the textile industry and to meet the people's increasing needs for textiles. From the grand occasion of the development of the textile industry in Shaanxi over the past ten years, I deeply realize that only the Chinese Communist Party is the savior of the Chinese people, and only socialism and communism are the only correct roads the Chinese people should take. We cheer for the rapid progress of the socialist construction cause of the motherland, and we cheer for the great and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We have unspeakable heartfelt gratitude to the Party. We must better study and work under the leadership of the Party and dedicate all our strength to the great socialist construction cause!

专栏：

    陕西纺织工业的十年
    傅道伸委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告并愿在工作中贯彻执行。对于李维汉副主席的政协二届全国委员会常委会工作报告和其他各位首长的报告我都完全拥护。
    解放前奄奄一息
    我个人从事纺织工业已经三十多年了，回忆解放前在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义重重压榨下，我国纺织工业奄奄一息，非常落后，当时伪政府曾计划在西安建一所两千锭子的纱厂，筹备几年始终未能办成，他们根本不为人民利益着想。解放后，党和人民政府关心人民生活需要，大力发展工业，特别是把陕西地区作为全国纺织工业重点建设基地之一，从而从根本上改变了陕西纺织工业的落后面貌，出现了蓬勃发展的新局面。同时从陕西一省纺织工业发展的盛况，也同样可以看到全国各项建设事业的发展盛况。现在我谨将陕西省纺织工业十年来的发展情况和我自己的一些体会向大会的同志们作一简要汇报。
    解放前，全国的纺织工厂大都集中在沿海一带。陕西关中平原所产的棉花，百分之八十以上要运到沿海地区去纺纱织布。广大产棉区的农民，长年辛勤劳动，却穿不上机织的细布衣裳。棉农在出卖棉花时，和其他农作物一样，还要受官僚资产阶级压级、压价的剥削。当时农民出售一担棉花有时还换不回一匹白棉布。因此，农民的生产情绪很低落，平均每亩皮棉产量最高的一九四六年也不过三十市斤，最低时曾下降到十一市斤；全省棉花总产量最高不过一百万担左右。那时候，陕西几乎没有什么现代工业，真正是“一穷二白”。纺织工业也很不像样子。一九四九年，全省只有五家纺织厂，纱锭设备总数仅八万八千三百多枚，普通织布机也只有一千三百余台。机器陈旧，设备简陋，管理落后，效率低下。至于工人的生活福利和劳动保护，在解放前根本谈不到。
    解放后蒸蒸日上
    解放后，在党的正确领导下，在集中力量发展重工业并相应的发展轻工业和工农业同时并举的方针下，陕西纺织工业有了很大的发展，原先落后的面貌现在已完全改观。从一九五二年到今年，差不多每年都有一座新型的大规模的纺织厂建成。还在头三年恢复时期，一九五一年夏天，国家在咸阳就开始筹建了西北国棉一厂，从土建、安装到正式投入生产，仅十一个月就建成了；不仅规模在当时是最新最大的，而且全套设备都是我国自己制造的。接着，国家先后在关中地区新建了七个大规模的新型棉纺织厂。到目前为止，全省投入生产的棉纺锭已达六十三万余枚，线锭二万七千余枚，自动布机一万五千多台。这些厂都是在中央纺织工业部和陕西省委直接指导下、苏联专家帮助下、在全国各兄弟地区大力支援下，由我们自己设计建成的。这些新型的棉纺织厂，一个比一个设备好，一个比一个建的快。其中最大的是国棉四厂，拥有纱锭十万多枚，自动布机三千二百多台，线锭二万六千多枚；正式建厂只用了一年时间。仅国棉四厂一个厂的规模，就比陕西省在解放前建厂总和还要多。正是由于这些国营企业的迅速建成，使社会主义经济成分在国民经济领域内的领导地位迅速巩固起来。这不仅加速了社会主义工业建设，同时也推进了私营企业的社会主义改造。一九五六年社会主义改造高潮中，国家又将五十五个小型织布厂合并为七个具有一定规模和技术条件的工厂。很多小织布厂在并厂合营后，依靠集体力量和群众智慧，很快地将一部分流传了几百年的脚踏手攀织布机，改造为电气马达传动。社会主义改造的结果，大大地鼓舞了这些厂工人群众的政治热情和生产积极性。生产技术和经营管理水平，比过去有了显著提高，出现了欣欣向荣的新局面。十年来，由于新建和扩建、改建的结果，目前全省已有新型棉纺织机械设备，比解放初期增加到八倍以上。现代化装备的印染整理厂，过去本省一个也没有，所产棉布除少部分用土法染色外，大部分都要送到外地去印染加工，增加了往返运费和成本。从一九五二年起，在西安郊区建成了年产一百万匹花色布的新西北印染厂，今年又建成了年产三百万匹布的西北第一印染厂，使本省棉布开始出现了万紫千红、如花似锦的品种。随着工农业生产飞跃发展，生活水平日益提高，人民对纺织品的要求也更高了。过去陕西地区所需纺织品主要依靠外地供应，现在本省纺织品不仅供应了西北人民的需要，而且行销到全国很多省份，很多棉织品如毛巾、被单之类还受到国际市场的欢迎。陕西纺织工人们都认识到，我国的纺织品能行销国外，这不仅有重大的经济意义，而且有重大的政治意义，自己能为社会主义祖国在国际市场上放出异彩，这是一件很光荣的事情。
    工人队伍扩大，技术水平提高
    随着新厂的陆续建设，纺织工人的队伍在迅速扩大和成长着。一九四九年，全省仅有纺织职工八千人，现在已经有了一支七万三千多人的纺织队伍。同时，在党的正确领导和经常教育下，工人的政治觉悟和技术水平，都有了很大提高。仅一九五八年大跃进的一年中，全省纺织工业共评选出先进生产者七千三百零三人，占全体职工总数的百分之十左右，其中连续几年被评选为先进生产者的有六百五十四人。他们在生产劳动中，创造了许多动人事迹。同时职工群众提出的合理化建议与创造发明层出不穷，据不完全的统计，全年技术革新建议和合理化建议能计算价值的共五千八百三十五件，其中重大项目有一千一百四十六件，为国家创造了很多的财富。十年来，生产水平有了显著提高，棉纱千锭小时单位产量，一九四九年只有十五点四八公斤，现在已提高到三十点六四公斤；棉布台时产量同期由二点七一七公尺提高到四点八公尺多，差不多每个锭子、每台布机的产量，都比过去增加了将近一倍。工人看锭、看台能力，也比过去提高了一倍到两倍。
    几年来，各厂在增加产量的同时，对提高质量和增加花色品种方面作了很大努力，取得了突飞猛进的成绩。一九四九年陕西各厂只能生产中支纱和粗支纱，织一些粗布和市布，质量差，品种也很单调。现在全省棉纱自六支纱到四十六支，有的厂选用本省长绒棉花还试纺成功了六十支细纱；棉布不但有市布、斜纹布而且还有了细布、华达呢、哔叽、防雨卡叽、府绸；很多小厂还生产了青花格、闪光呢、锦绣呢、提花布以及平绒等新产品；印染厂针织复制厂也不断革新品种，创造新花样，生产的孔雀开屏、印花灯芯绒、香味花布、拔染毛巾、提花毛巾被等，很受消费者欢迎。特别是一九五八年全省纺织职工在整风运动胜利的基础上，先后开展了奋战四十天、一百天和七十天的三次战役，由于依靠党的领导，坚持了政治挂帅，发动了群众，不断地解放思想、破除迷信，克服了右倾保守思想，使纱布、印染和针织复制品的质量有很大一部分在全国争得上游，花色品种增加到五百多种，其中主要产品有五十多种达到国内先进水平，二十多种达到出口要求。
    在技术水平方面，陕西各厂也逐年有所提高。如国棉一厂在正式投入生产还不到一年时间，细纱千锭小时断头率就创造了从一百六十八根降低到七十六根的全国新纪录，在一九五三年获得了全国模范纺纱工厂的光荣称号；接着许多厂还创造了细纱断头不超过本支数的最新纪录。国棉三厂开工生产后就重视了日常基础性技术管理工作，使布机用梭量创造了万公尺耗用零点一五七把的全国纪录。新西北印染厂试验双头硫化蓝轧染成功，使日产量由一千五百匹提高到三千匹。西北第一印染厂还在试车生产中就试验成功了双氧水炼漂，使煮漂工艺的时间由原来的四十小时缩短到五小时，并提高了质量，降低了成本，全面推广后，可使这个厂的生产水平比原设计水平提高不止一倍。随着生产技术水平的迅速提高，劳动生产率也在迅速增长。一九五八年每个工人的劳动生产率比一九四九年增长近三倍。
    群众运动一浪高过一浪
    通过大搞群众运动，陕西各纺织厂不仅在生产上实现了跃进，而且在政治上、思想上有了巨大的收获。特别是各厂在认真贯彻执行“两参一改三结合”的经验以后，有不少干部参加了劳动，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，初步实现了到群众中去领导群众，到生产中去领导生产的原则，密切了和群众的关系。工人参加管理以后，大大提高了主人翁的责任感，有效地改进了企业管理工作。去年陕西省纺织工业所以能够有效地突破一些生产技术关键并使七项尖端技术和十二项重大技术的改进初步试验成功，都是由于坚持了政治挂帅，实现了工人、领导干部和技术人员三结合的结果。因此全省各厂年来大都经常能够在生产过程中战胜一切困难，使得以高产高质为中心的、全面贯彻
  “四高四省”的群众运动，一浪高过一浪、不断地向前推进。
    在发展生产的同时，党和国家对纺织工人的生活福利也是非常重视的。新建厂在设计和建厂时，就无微不至地照顾到了工人的劳动条件、物质文化生活和维护职工身体健康与安全。生产厂房四周是生活区，设有职工休息室、妇女卫生室、食堂、阅览室、沐浴室等；厂房内有通风降温设备，可以设法调节温湿度，使车间气候“四季如春”；全部机器都装有安全防护装置。其他如职工宿舍、托儿所、幼儿园、医院、业余学校，以及体育和文娱活动等等，在各厂都是应有尽有，较之解放以前真不啻有霄壤之别。
    关系工农联盟的一件大事
    陕西纺织工业能够在短短几年内得到很大的发展，这一事实充分说明了党的方针政策的正确，同时也证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。只有在共产党领导之下，只有在我们社会主义国家里，劳动人民当家作主，充分发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，才能获得这样伟大的成就。同时陕西纺织工业的发展，和广大农民的支持也是分不开的。十年来，陕西的棉花，不论在产量和质量方面都有了很大的提高。由一九四九年皮棉亩产三十市斤增长到五七年的四十七市斤。在一九五八年大跃进中，棉花亩产量更创造了百斤的新纪录。不但产量增加，而且纤维品质也有了改进。现在农民们正在努力改进耕作技术，积极采用优良品种，争取更高更好的收获。这就给棉纺织工业的飞跃发展，提供了丰富的有利物质条件。除了盛产棉花的关中平原外，陕北榆林一带还有着广阔的牧场。在“风吹草低见牛羊”的原野上，毛的产量质量几年来都有很大的提高；在陕南安康、陕北清涧一带，丛山阳坡，桑树连绵，蚕丝产量也是很丰富的。各种野生纤维，据初步调查年产在百万担以上。这些都为发展毛、麻、丝等纺织企业提供了丰富资源。
    为了进一步满足人民对纺织品的需要，陕西纺织工业今后还将有更大发展。新的纺织企业，行将一个接着一个建设起来。可以肯定的指出，陕西纺织工业的发展前景，是无比光辉灿烂的。纺织工人们一致认识到，高速度的发展纺织工业，是关系人民群众丰衣的一件大事，是关系工农联盟的一件大事，也是关系为国家建设事业积累资金的一件大事。因此，我们大家都满怀信心地为高速发展纺织工业，为满足人民对纺织品日益增高的需要而奋斗着。从陕西纺织工业十年来发展的盛况，我深深体会到只有中国共产党是中国人民的救星，只有社会主义、共产主义是中国人民应走的唯一的正确道路。我们为祖国的社会主义建设事业一日千里的跃进而欢呼，我们为中国共产党和毛主席的伟大英明领导而欢呼。我们对于党有说不出来的衷心的感激之情，我们一定要在党的领导下，更好地学习，更好地工作，为伟大的社会主义建设事业献出自己的全部力量！
