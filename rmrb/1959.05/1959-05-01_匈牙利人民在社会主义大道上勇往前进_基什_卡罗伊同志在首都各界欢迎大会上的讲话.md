Comrades, friends:

    Please allow me to begin with a fraternal greeting. The working people of Hungary have entrusted us with conveying their cordial greetings to the working people of the People's Republic of China. I would like to fulfill this task first. I feel deep and sincere joy in being able to convey the greetings of our people here in the capital of the People's Republic of China on this day, on the eve of the great festival of the international working class.

    Just one look around here, at you, and listening to your voices is enough to make one feel what the strength shown by the working class—the leader of the working people—means. Just think, the son of our distant small country can be here in the capital of your great nation with its 680 million people like a brother. It is enough to make one feel what a great force proletarian internationalism is. Just think, from the Danube to the Pacific Ocean, we can travel thousands of kilometers on socialist soil. That will quickly make it clear what the changes that have taken place on earth since the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 mean. Just thinking about this is enough: even though our small country is very far away, with different languages, histories, and social development situations, it is walking the same road as the people of your great country and the millions of people in the countries of the great socialist camp.

    Tomorrow, May 1st, the working class all over the world will celebrate everywhere. People from distant places and children from distant countries gather here with the great thought of proletarian internationalism. We can proudly say that the unbreakable friendship between the people of our two countries and the countries of the socialist camp marks the strength of Marxist-Leninist thought and its irresistible victory. It is a big deal for us to be able to declare on the land of the fraternal People's Republic of China that the new and happy life of our two countries is built on the foundation of Marxist-Leninist thought. Marxist-Leninist thought guides us to carry out the resolute struggle to win the victory of socialism, and this thought is also the inexhaustible source of the fraternal friendship between our two countries. There have been many talks in history about relations, alliances and treaties between countries. But our era has given new content to the relations between countries and peoples. First of all, in today's era of the birth and strengthening of socialist countries, the relations between countries are consistent with the relations between peoples. Because in socialist countries, the people and the country are one. This relationship is new because only between socialist countries can there be the kind of deep and unbreakable relationship built on the basis of fraternal, mutual assistance and mutual support. This relationship also exists between the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic. This relationship is new in history because it cannot be compared with the so-called alliances of the past built on the basis of temporary common interests, because our fraternal friendship has a solid foundation of principles, which is unwavering loyalty to Marxist-Leninist theory, and loyal and selfless service to our common struggle and the great socialist cause.

    Dear comrades and friends! You know that in 1956 our Hungarian People's Republic was in a serious situation. International imperialism and the Hungarian reactionaries, colluding with the revisionist traitors who had sneaked into our party, launched a counter-revolutionary riot, attempting to separate our country from the family of nations building socialism, and attempting to put Hungary back on the imperialist shackles, making Hungary a forward position against the socialist camp. But this despicable conspiracy did not succeed. They were unable to overthrow the people's regime and unable to restore capitalism. They were unable to subvert the people's regime in Hungary, because in this critical moment, the international working class, under the guidance of the spirit of proletarian internationalism, came to assist the Hungarian working class, which was struggling in difficult circumstances, with all their hearts and all their strength. The Soviet Union assisted us, you - our dear Chinese friends assisted us, and the entire socialist camp assisted us. Please allow me, on behalf of all the people of our country, to express here, in your beautiful country, my gratitude for the significant support we received during the difficult times. When Comrade Zhou Enlai and the Chinese comrades accompanying him came to our country in January 1957, shortly after the counter-revolution was suppressed, they saw how serious the wounds caused by the counter-revolutionary riot were. We also experienced economic difficulties. After the counter-revolutionary events, our production was in chaos. In addition, it could also be seen how serious the dangers and losses caused to the Hungarian people by the crazy conspiracy attacks of domestic and international reactionaries. However, the comrades who had been to our place could also see that the best forces of the Hungarian working class, in the first few weeks after the counter-revolutionary riot was suppressed, used all their strength, all their knowledge and determination to prove that they were faithfully adhering to their posts, and used their actions to show that they had not failed the assistance and support of their friends. I think everyone will understand the happy mood I feel when I report the not-small achievements made by the Hungarian working class, working peasants and intellectuals loyal to the people last year. Thanks to the selfless assistance of fraternal socialist countries and the selfless labor of the Hungarian working people, the proletarian dictatorship in Hungary has been consolidated, and I can also be very happy to tell you that we have also made achievements in socialist construction.

    With the support and active, creative cooperation of the working people, the Party and the government quickly and resolutely restored the economic life that had been damaged by the counter-revolutionary riots. In 1958, Hungary's industry had increased by 12% compared with 1957, and now our industrial production level is higher than ever before. There has also been progress in developing agriculture. Although the weather was bad last year, the total output value of our agriculture is still higher than ever before. Thanks to the Party's firm implementation of correct economic policies, the living standards of the working people have also been improved on the basis of the growth of industry and agriculture.

    The workers and peasants of Hungary clearly know that only they themselves can create the possibility of further improving their living standards, and their labor and the development of the national economy are the foundation for building a better tomorrow. The resurgence and vigorous development of the socialist labor competition proves that this idea is not a simple sentence, but a driving force that plays a role in the people's minds. The socialist transformation of Hungary has also taken a big step forward. After the storm of the counter-revolution, many of our production cooperatives not only remained, but became more consolidated, and since then, many new production cooperatives have been established. At the beginning of this year, the production cooperative movement had a vigorous development. Today, 48% of the agricultural land in the Hungarian People's Republic belongs to socialist components.

    Political consolidation can also be justifiably compared with economic consolidation and new achievements in socialist construction. The Hungarian people's regime and the proletarian dictatorship are stronger than ever before. In 1958, we decided to hold a general election. In this election, the reactionaries suffered a heavy defeat. Millions of people participated in the pre-election congresses. These congresses became political and social mass demonstrations. These mass demonstrations proved unequivocally to everyone that our working people resolutely support our people's democratic system. In the election, the candidates of the Patriotic People's Front led by our Party received 99.6% of the valid votes. I believe that the unanimous attitude of the national voters is a solemn answer to the counter-revolutionary bad guys, and a solemn statement in favor of the socialist construction since liberation and its great victory.

    However, we also know that in order to maintain and expand our achievements, we still need to carry out arduous struggles and persistent daily labor. In the Hungarian People's Republic, there are still some people who have lost their past economic and political ruling power due to the victory of the proletarian dictatorship. These people are capitalists, landlords, servants of the capitalist system and the fascist system, and bad guys who cunningly oppress the people. But we want them to abide by the law, and whoever violates the law of the people should be responsible for the consequences. Of course, these people are only a minority compared with our millions of working people. What is important is that the vast majority of the people, the entire working class, the entire working peasants and the intellectuals engaged in creative labor, that is, all those who support themselves, support the People's Republic and the people's regime. This is what we are most proud of. It is also what we must protect like the apples of our eyes.

    The consolidation of the unity of our people, the close unity of the people and the Party is due to the fact that our Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, has consistently implemented a firm and uncompromising principled policy since the smashing of the counter-revolution. Our Party is united and leads our people with the greatest determination to fight for the complete construction of socialism. Today, all the people of our country have understood and felt the power of the great Marxist-Leninist principles and the thought of proletarian internationalism. We live as an inseparable and permanent member in the fraternal collective of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which gives us great strength for construction work. 1956 was a tragic and valuable lesson. The people of our country will never forget the lessons of this bloody counter-revolutionary adventure, and are prepared to give a resolute rebuff to all attempts to separate our country from the fraternal collective of the socialist camp. Dear friends, you know how much shameful role the disguised Marxist-Leninists and the revisionist groups who infiltrated the Party leadership at that time played in enabling imperialism and the reactionaries to launch a crazy counter-revolutionary attack in our country. In our country, revisionism prepared the conditions for the counter-revolution. These despicable traitors exaggerated the mistakes made in socialist construction, and tried to create an atmosphere suitable for launching a general attack on the people's regime. This attack caused disasters to all the Hungarian people.

    Therefore, the traitors received the heavy but in all respects deserved punishment from the people's regime, which is completely just and reasonable.

    Our historical experience has also greatly helped the Hungarian communists and all the working people of Hungary to most resolutely criticize modern revisionism. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia attempts to systematize modern revisionism.

    All such conspiracies today are aimed at weakening the strength of the socialist camp and loosening the rock-solid close unity, which will only make those enemies and imperialists who hate socialism happy. This is especially clear and understandable to us who have suffered from the counter-revolutionary attack. In our country, people read Comrade Mao Zedong's works in Hungarian. We remember that Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in 1949 in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "'You lean to one side.' Exactly. The forty years of experience of Sun Yat-sen and the twenty-eight years of experience of the Communist Party have taught us that we must lean to one side in order to achieve victory and consolidate victory. With the experience of forty years and twenty-eight years, the Chinese people either lean to the side of imperialism or lean to the side of socialism, without exception. It is impossible to ride on the fence, and there is no third road." This statement applies not only to the Chinese people. According to the experience of the workers' movement in our era, this is a very important reminder to all of us. Modern revisionists should also understand that "it is impossible to ride on the fence..."

    Dear comrades! Friends!

    I would like to especially emphasize the important fact: although our country has suffered a serious counter-revolutionary attack, the development of our socialist construction has never been interrupted. The Hungarian people are advancing bravely on the road of socialism, and are consciously building a happy future with optimism. While overcoming the mistakes we have made in the past, we are carrying out the construction work of the country with great enthusiasm. The political and ideological unity of our people, the correct policies of the Party, and the achievements we have already made can prove that the Hungarian people, like the people of other fraternal countries, are combat partners of the great socialist camp. Let me talk about how important the news of the great achievements of the fraternal socialist countries is to us in our construction work. The Hungarian people are amazed and admire your very great achievements. Dear comrades, the great leap forward made by the People's Republic of China in 1958 in the development of the national economy is of great significance to us. We are happy about the great leap forward in China's industry and agriculture, not only because we see that this can make the great fraternal people stronger, but also because we know that these unparalleled victories can make the day when socialism wins in the world closer, and for the entire socialist camp, the strength has been greatly strengthened.

    It is natural that our enemies, the imperialists, especially the US imperialists, are afraid of these achievements and afraid of the continuous growth of this strength. They have not abandoned the illusion that they can disrupt or prevent the socialist construction of our countries by relying on foreign aggression and subversion from within.

    In recent times, they have chosen the Far East as one of the most important centers for carrying out conspiracy activities. Whether in Europe or in the Far East, they have extensively established a network of military bases, and are also trying to provide nuclear weapons, and are trying their best to tighten the supervision of the Southeast Asian Treaty countries. They are testing their aggression plans in the Taiwan area and in Tibet. The purpose of doing all this in Taiwan, South Korea and South Vietnam is to create chaos by constantly inciting.

    Of course, these attempts are doomed to failure. But this does not mean that we do not need constant vigilance. If we are not vigilant, it will only embolden the enemy.

    Our policy is a policy of peace. Therefore, we do everything we can to support the proposals of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries on the abolition of war bases, the relaxation of international tensions and the guarantee of peace. The proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on disarmament, the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, the settlement of the status of Berlin and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany serve these noble purposes.

    We believe that exercising sovereignty over Taiwan is an inalienable right of the People's Republic of China. The time is not far when these places will be unified with other parts of China, and the time has come when the People's Republic of China can occupy its due legal status in the United Nations.

    The events that have taken place in the international situation make it increasingly clear to everyone with a clear mind that, as you often say so incisively: "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind". The common will of the people of all countries fighting for peace, progress and national independence is such a powerful force that, compared with it, all attempts by the imperialist bloc to realize its own will are in vain. For us, some of the recent events in the international situation have only further confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's memorable assertion about the international balance of power. He said: "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The magnificent seven-year plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the historical leap-forward development of the People's Republic of China, the artificial satellites launched by the socialist world into outer space and the first Soviet artificial planet orbiting in the solar system, and the many achievements made by the socialist brother countries in their work - these are all signs of our strength growth. The growth of our strength is also huge for the entire human race, because through these, millions of people are writing new history.

    Dear comrades, dear friends!

    The most important foundation for the socialist countries to obtain historically significant achievements is the unity of the socialist camp. We are very happy about the growing development of the fraternal unity relations between China and Hungary. The trade volume between the two countries has increased, and good results have been achieved in scientific and technological cooperation. Cultural ties are also developing well. The deepening of relations between our two countries is not only reflected in the fact that Hungarian buses are running in Chinese cities, and more and more Chinese goods are displayed in the windows of Hungarian city shops, but also in the fact that we understand each other's culture better. In the past decade, nearly eighty Hungarian literary works have been translated and published in Chinese, and at the same time, nearly the same number of Chinese works have been published in our language.

    The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation also means the further development of this relationship. This is also one of the main purposes of our visit. We deeply believe that this treaty is of great significance to the people of our two countries, and it will further strengthen the ties between the two countries and the unity of the socialist camp.

    Dear comrades, dear friends!

    Now, on the eve of this great festival of proletarian internationalism, please allow me to convey the heartfelt congratulations of all the working people of Hungary to you. We sincerely wish the strong fraternal people - the Chinese people, to continue to work happily and confidently in the socialist construction of their great motherland. The People's Republic of China is currently showing amazing efforts and unprecedented rapid development. Dear comrades! I wish you complete victory in building socialism and building communism soon!

    Long live the great and creative labor of the hardworking people of the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the eternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary!

    Long live the rock-solid internationalist unity of the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live mankind fighting for peace!

    匈牙利人民在社会主义大道上勇往前进
    基什·卡罗伊同志在首都各界欢迎大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    请允许我把兄弟的问候作为我的第一句话。匈牙利劳动人民委托我们把他们的亲切的问候转达给中华人民共和国的劳动人民，我想首先来完成这一任务。我能够在今天、在国际工人阶级的伟大节日的前夕，在中华人民共和国的首都转达我国人民的问候，感到深切的和真诚的喜悦。
    只要从这里往四周看一眼，看一看你们，听一听你们的声音，就足以使人感到工人阶级——劳动人民的领导者所表现的力量意味着什么。只要想一想，我们遥远的小国的儿子能够在这里，在你们拥有六亿八千万人民的伟大国家的首都处得像兄弟一样，就足以使人感到无产阶级国际主义是一个多么伟大的力量。只要想一想，从多瑙河到太平洋，我们能够在社会主义的国土上旅行成千上万公里，那就会很快地明白，1917年伟大的十月社会主义革命以来在地球上发生的变化意味着什么。只要想一想这一点就够了：我们小国即使距离十分遥远，语言不同，历史和社会发展的情况不一样，但是，它却和你们伟大国家的人民和伟大的社会主义阵营各国千百万人民走着同一条道路。
    明天，5月1日，世界各地工人阶级将到处欢庆。远方的人民和远方国家的儿女们怀着伟大的无产阶级国际主义的思想在这里相聚，我们可以自豪地说：我们两国人民之间和社会主义阵营各国之间的牢不可破的友谊标志着马克思列宁主义思想的力量和它的不可阻挡的胜利。我们能在兄弟的中华人民共和国的土地上宣称：我们两国人民的幸福的新生活是建筑在马克思列宁主义思想基础上的，这对我们来说是一件大事。马克思列宁主义思想领导着我们去进行争取社会主义胜利的坚决斗争，并且这一思想也是我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊的永不枯竭的泉源。关于国家之间的关系、同盟和条约，在历史上已经谈过很多次了。但是我们的时代却赋予了各个国家和人民之间的关系以崭新的内容。首先，在今天这个社会主义国家诞生和加强的时代，国家之间的关系同人民之间的关系是一致的。因为在社会主义国家里，人民和国家是一回事。这种关系之所以是新型的还因为只有在社会主义国家之间才可能有那种建筑在兄弟般的、相互帮助和相互支持基础上的深厚的和牢不可破的关系。这一关系在中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国之间也存在着。这种关系在历史上之所以是新型的，还因为它不能同过去建筑在一时的共同利益基础上的所谓同盟相提并论，因为我们的兄弟友谊有着巩固的原则基础，这就是对马克思列宁主义理论的坚定不移的忠贞，为我们共同的斗争和伟大的社会主义事业所作的忠诚的忘我的服务。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！你们知道1956年我们匈牙利人民共和国曾处于严重的境地。国际帝国主义和匈牙利的反动派，同混进我们党内的修正主义叛徒相勾结，发动了反革命暴乱，企图使我国脱离建设社会主义的各国人民的大家庭，并且试图重新将匈牙利套上帝国主义的枷锁，使匈牙利成为反对社会主义阵营的前哨阵地。可是这个卑鄙的阴谋没有成功。他们无力推翻人民政权，无法使资本主义复辟。他们没有能够颠覆匈牙利的人民政权，因为在这危急的时刻，国际工人阶级在无产阶级国际主义精神指导下，都全心全力地来援助在艰苦情况下进行斗争的匈牙利工人阶级。苏联援助了我们，你们——我们亲爱的中国朋友们援助了我们，整个社会主义阵营都援助了我们。请允许我代表我国全体人民，在这里，在你们美好的国家里，对在艰苦时期内我们所得到的意义巨大的支持表示感谢。当1957年1月周恩来同志和随行的中国同志们在反革命被镇压之后不久来到我国的时候，他们曾经看到反革命暴乱造成了多么严重的创伤。我们还经历了经济上的困难，反革命事件后，我们的生产曾出现过混乱。除此以外，也可以看出我国国内和国际反动派疯狂的阴谋进攻，对匈牙利全国人民造成了多么严重的危险和损失。但是，到过我们那里的同志们也可以看到，匈牙利工人阶级最优秀的力量，在反革命暴乱被镇压后的最初几个星期里，就用全部力量、全部知识和决心证明了他们忠实地坚持着自己的岗位，并且以自己的行动来表明他们并没有辜负朋友们的援助和支持。我想大家对于我在报告匈牙利工人阶级、劳动农民和忠于人民的知识分子在去年所取得的不小的成就的时候所感到的愉快的心情是会理解的。由于兄弟社会主义国家的无私援助和匈牙利劳动人民的忘我劳动，匈牙利的无产阶级专政巩固了，我还可以很高兴地告诉大家，我们在社会主义建设方面也取得了成就。
    党和政府在劳动人民的支持和积极的、创造性的合作下，迅速地、坚决地恢复了被反革命暴乱所损害了的经济生活。1958年匈牙利的工业已经比1957年增产了12％，现在我国的工业生产水平要比过去任何时候都高。在发展农业方面也有了成绩。尽管去年气候不好，但是我国农业的总产值仍然比过去任何时候都高。由于党坚决实行了正确的经济政策，在工农业增长的基础上，劳动人民的生活水平也有了提高。
    匈牙利的工人和农民们清楚地知道，只有他们自己才能够创造进一步提高生活水平的可能性，他们的劳动和国民经济的发展是建设更美好的明天的基础。社会主义劳动竞赛的重新掀起和蓬勃发展，证明了这个思想不是一句简单的话，而是在人民思想中起作用的动力。匈牙利的社会主义改造也向前迈进了一大步。在反革命的风暴以后，我们的许多生产合作社不仅保留下来了，而且更加巩固了，并且从那时以来，已经建立了许多新的生产合作社。今年初，生产合作社运动有了蓬勃的发展。今天，匈牙利人民共和国农业耕地面积的48％已是属于社会主义成分的了。
    政治上的巩固也可以无愧地与经济上的巩固和社会主义建设的新成就相媲美。匈牙利人民政权和无产阶级专政比过去任何时候都更加坚强了。1958年我们决定举行大选，在这次选举中反动派遭到了惨重的失败，有几百万人参加了选举前的大会，这些大会变成了政治性的和社会性的群众示威。这些群众示威不容误解地向每个人证明了，我们的劳动人民是坚决地拥护我们的人民民主制度的。在选举中，我们党所领导的爱国人民阵线的候选人，得到了有效选票的99.6％。我相信全国选民的这种一致的态度是对反革命坏蛋们的严正的回答，是拥护解放以来的社会主义建设和它的伟大胜利的庄严的表态。
    但是，我们也知道，为了保持和扩大我们已经达到的成就，还需要我们进行艰苦的斗争，和坚持不懈的日常劳动。在匈牙利人民共和国还存在着一些因无产阶级专政胜利而丧失了他们过去经济、政治统治权的人们，这些人就是资本家、地主、资本主义制度和法西斯主义制度的仆从们，和很狡猾地欺压人民的坏蛋。但是我们要他们严守法律，谁要是违反人民的法律，谁就应该对他的后果负责。当然这些人同我们几百万的劳动人民相比，只不过是少数。重要的是，绝大多数人民，全体工人阶级，全体劳动农民和从事创造性劳动的知识分子，也就是所有一切自食其力的人们都是拥护人民共和国和人民政权的。这是我们最足以自豪的。也是我们要像保护眼珠一样地加以保护的。
    我国人民团结的巩固，人民和党的亲密团结是由于我们的党，匈牙利社会主义工人党，自从粉碎反革命以来，一贯执行了坚定的和毫不妥协的原则政策。我们的党团结一致，并且以最大的决心领导着我国人民为完全建成社会主义而斗争。今天，我国全体人民已经懂得并且感觉到伟大的马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义思想的力量。我们是作为一个不可分割的，永久的家庭成员生活在以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的兄弟集体中的，这给了我们建设工作以巨大的力量。1956年是一个悲惨的和宝贵的一课，我国人民永远不会忘记这一血腥的反革命冒险的教训，并且准备对一切要把我国从社会主义阵营兄弟的集体中分离出来的企图，给予坚决的回击。亲爱的朋友们，你们知道，伪装的马克思列宁主义者和当时混进党领导内的修正主义集团，对帝国主义和反动派所以能在我国发动疯狂的反革命进攻起了多大的可耻的作用。在我们这里，修正主义为反革命准备了条件。这些卑鄙的叛徒们夸大了社会主义建设中所犯的错误，试图造成适合于发动对人民政权普遍进攻的气氛。这一进攻使全体匈牙利人民遭到了灾害。
    因此，叛徒受到了人民政权沉重的但是从各方面来说都是应得的惩罚，这是完全公正的和合理的。
    我们的历史经验在很大的程度上也有助于使匈牙利共产党员和匈牙利的全体劳动人民最坚决地批判现代修正主义。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领试图使现代修正主义系统化。
    就是所有这样的阴谋，在今天都是为了削弱社会主义阵营的力量和松弛坚如磐石的紧密团结的，这，仅仅会使那些对社会主义心怀仇恨的敌人和帝国主义分子们感到高兴。这一点，对我们遭受过反革命的进攻的人来说，是特别的清楚和能够理解的。在我们的国家里，人们用匈牙利文阅读毛泽东同志的著作。我们记得毛泽东同志在1949年所著的“论人民民主专政”中写到：“‘你们一边倒’。正是这样。一边倒，是孙中山的四十年经验和共产党的二十八年经验教给我们的，深知欲达到胜利和巩固胜利，必须一边倒。积四十年和二十八年的经验，中国人不是倒向帝国主义一边，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外。骑墙是不行的，第三条道路是没有的。”这种论断不仅适用于中国人民。根据我们时代的工人运动的经验来看，这对我们所有的人来说都是很重要的提醒。现代修正主义者们也应该明白这一点，就是“骑墙是不行的……”
    亲爱的同志们！朋友们！
    我想特别强调指出这一重大事实：即我国虽然曾遭到反革命的严重进攻，但是我国的社会主义建设的发展却从未中断过。匈牙利人民正在社会主义的大道上勇往前进，并且自觉地抱着乐观主义精神在建设幸福的未来。我们在克服过去所犯的错误的同时，正在以巨大的热情进行国家的建设工作。我们的人民在政治思想上的团结、党的正确政策和我们已经取得的成就都可以证明，匈牙利人民和其他兄弟国家的人民一样，是伟大的社会主义阵营的战斗伙伴。让我来谈一谈在我们的建设工作中有关兄弟的社会主义国家的伟大成就的消息对我们有着多么重要的作用。匈牙利人民对你们非常巨大的成就感到惊奇和钦佩。亲爱的同志们，中华人民共和国1958年在发展国民经济方面取得的大跃进，对我们是有很大意义的。我们对中国工农业大跃进感到高兴，不仅仅是因为我们看到这能够使伟大的兄弟人民壮大起来，而且还因为我们知道，这些无可比拟的胜利更能够使社会主义在世界范围内取得胜利的日子更加接近，对整个社会主义阵营来说，力量因此大大地加强了。
    我们的敌人，帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义害怕这些成就，害怕这种力量的不断强大，那是自然的事情。他们还没有抛弃幻想，以为依靠外来的侵略和在内部搞颠覆活动就能够打乱或者阻止我们这些国家的社会主义建设。
    在最近一段时间里，他们挑选远东用来作为进行阴谋活动的最重要的中心之一。无论在欧洲或者在远东地区，他们都广泛地建立了军事基地网，还力图提供核武器，并且正在尽力设法加紧对东南亚条约国家的监督。一会儿在台湾地区，一会儿又在西藏试验它们的侵略计划。他们在台湾、南朝鲜和南越等地方干这一切的目的，就是要用经常不断地煽动的办法来制造混乱。
    当然，这些尝试是注定要失败的。但是这并不是说，我们不需要经常的警惕了。如果我们不警惕，那就只能壮大敌人的胆量。
    我们的政策是和平的政策。因此，我们尽一切力量支持苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家关于取消战争基地、缓和国际紧张局势和保障和平的建议。苏联提出关于裁军、停止核武器试验、解决柏林地位和缔结对德和约等建议都是为这些崇高的目的服务的。
    我们认为，在台湾行使主权是中华人民共和国不可分割的权利。这些地方同中国其它部分统一的时候已经不远，中华人民共和国在联合国能占有它应得的合法地位的时候已经来到了。
    国际局势中所发生的事件，使每一个头脑清醒的人越来越清楚地看到，正如你们常常那样精辟地说明的：“东风压倒西风”。为和平、进步和民族独立而斗争的各国人民的共同意志是这样一种强大的力量，和它比较起来，帝国主义集团一切实现自己意志的企图都是枉然的。对我们来说，国际形势中最近发生的一些事件只有更加证实了毛泽东同志关于国际力量对比的值得牢记的论断。他说：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的宏伟的七年计划，中华人民共和国的具有历史意义的跃进式的发展，社会主义世界向宇宙空间所发射的人造卫星和正在太阳系中运行的第一个苏联人造行星，社会主义的兄弟国家在工作中所取得的许多成就——这些都是我们力量增长的标志。我们力量的增长就整个人类来说也是巨大的，因为通过这些，千百万人正在写着新的历史。
    亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    社会主义国家获得具有历史意义的成就的最重要的基础就是社会主义阵营的团结。我们为中匈两国兄弟般的团结关系的日益发展而十分高兴，两国之间的贸易额增长了，科学和技术合作方面取得了很好的成绩，文化方面的联系也正在良好地发展。我们两国之间关系的加深不仅表现在中国的城市里行驶着匈牙利的公共汽车、匈牙利城市商店的橱窗中摆着越来越多的中国商品，而且也在于，我们彼此都更加了解对方的文化了。在过去十年中，差不多有八十种匈牙利文学作品被翻译成中文出版，同时，也有差不多同样数量的中国作品用我们的文字出版。
    友好合作条约也意味着这一关系的进一步发展。这也是我们这次访问的主要目的之一。我们深深地相信，这个条约对于我们两国人民都有着巨大的意义，它也会进一步加强两国之间的联系和社会主义阵营的团结。
    亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    现在，在这无产阶级国际主义伟大节日的前夕，请允许我把匈牙利全体劳动人民的衷心的祝贺转达给你们。我们衷心地祝愿强大的兄弟人民——中国人民，在自己伟大祖国的社会主义建设中，继续愉快地、满怀信心地进行工作。中华人民共和国目前正在表现出惊人的努力和史无前例的飞速发展。亲爱的同志们！祝你们在早日建成社会主义和建设共产主义方面取得完全的胜利！
    中华人民共和国勤劳人民的伟大的和创造性的劳动万岁！
    中匈两国人民永恒的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民坚如磐石的国际主义团结万岁！
    为和平而斗争的人类万岁！
