    Old Professor He Dingjie
    By our correspondent Yin Ping
    In the classrooms of Wuhan University's Biology Department, in the experimental farms, and in the student dormitories, one can often see an old professor with white hair and beard, enthusiastically guiding students in their homework and internships, patiently answering their various questions. This old professor is the famous biologist He Dingjie. He is an old professor who has been engaged in education for forty years. In recent years, because he has conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy and continuously improved the quality of teaching, he has won the love and respect of teachers and students, who affectionately call him "Old He."
    Professor He Dingjie is already over sixty years old. When I visited him, he had just recovered from a cold and his body had not fully recovered. But as soon as the topic of teaching came up, he immediately became excited. He said, "As a teacher, I feel honored and proud." Then, he repeatedly emphasized, "The responsibility of a teacher is great, especially as a university professor, the students cultivated must be 'finished products'. The actions of a teacher have a great impact on young people. If one is not correct in their work or character, it will cause losses." He is so strict with himself and takes his teaching work seriously and responsibly, and even in his old age, he has not relaxed at all, and his enthusiasm is only growing stronger.
    Professor He Dingjie has been devoted to teaching and research in biology since his youth. As early as twenty years ago, in order to master the advanced Soviet biological theories, he learned Russian in his spare time, and then theoretically accepted the Michurin doctrine. For decades, he has been studying tirelessly, thus acquiring a wealth of theoretical knowledge, especially in zoology. After liberation, his work became even more active, especially his teaching work, which can be said to be meticulous. He actively participates in teaching groups, prepares lessons with young teachers, and discusses together. Before class, he insists on giving a pre-lecture within the group, repeatedly listening to the opinions of teachers and students, and making revisions and supplements. After class, he actively goes among the students to solicit opinions and does not relax on any small problem in teaching. Once, after he finished talking about the life habits of the animal pangolin, a student raised a question, saying that what he said differed from what was recorded in other books. After returning home, he searched for various materials for investigation and research, and finally satisfactorily answered the question. In the past, professors at Wuhan University never participated in tutoring and experiments, but Professor He Dingjie, in order to be fully responsible for the students, took the initiative to devote time to tutoring and experimental guidance. Sometimes, he spent three nights a week going deep into the student dormitories for tutoring, and the tutoring work was even more detailed for some worker-peasant cadre students and students with a weak foundation, explaining again and again without getting tired of it. Moreover, he also paid special attention to the problems discovered in tutoring and experiments, and seriously studied and improved teaching. Once, he found that everyone did not fully understand a chapter in zoology and had many questions. After repeated research, he finally found the reason: the main reason was that too few experiments were done when teaching this chapter. So, he immediately tried to improve it and solved the problem. Especially in recent years, Professor He Dingjie has also conscientiously linked theory with practice and production, often going down to experimental poultry farms to participate in production labor and scientific research, observing the living conditions of poultry, and enriching the teaching materials. Under his efforts, the phenomenon of zoology being divorced from reality and dry and tasteless has been fundamentally changed, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved.
      "If I have made some progress in teaching work, especially in the issue of linking theory with practice, then it should be attributed to the Party." He Dingjie especially emphasized this point. Indeed, how to take the road of linking theory with practice, and how to combine teaching with production labor, was not immediately clear to Professor He Dingjie, as he himself said: "When the Party proposed that education must be combined with production labor, although I supported it, it was so difficult to do specifically!"
    In October last year, the Biology Department began to criticize bourgeois academic thinking. At that time, He Dingjie thought to himself that he had always been engaged in Michurin's theories, and there was not much of a problem. However, after the academic criticism began, teachers and students criticized him for being long-term divorced from production and reality, and for having a tendency to theorize for the sake of theory. At this time, the Party helped him in a timely manner, and the school Party committee affirmed his achievements in conscientiously doing a good job in teaching for decades, and at the same time pointed out to him that he must change the phenomenon of theory being divorced from reality in order to embark on the road of being both red and expert.
    He Dingjie calmly considered the instructions of the Party organization and the opinions of teachers and students. When he thought that Michurin had worked for sixty years in his life, often participating in production labor and creating more than three hundred varieties, enriching scientific theory from production practice, he felt that he had done too little. Especially when he recalled the scene at the National Genetics Conference held in Qingdao in 1957, when he did not dare to call himself a Michurinist and spoke evasively, he broke out in a cold sweat. But why didn't he dare? Did he doubt Michurin? No. It was that he had too little practical knowledge and could not come up with convincing examples to demonstrate! When he thought of these things, he felt more and more the greatness and correctness of the Party, and the correctness of the masses' opinions, and his mood suddenly cleared up. He said, "I thank the Party for pointing out the correct path in my old age; I also thank the teachers and students who have criticized me. They are all my confidants and have given me valuable advice."
   Since then, his mood has become more cheerful, his teaching has become more serious, and he has paid special attention to overcoming the shortcomings of theory being divorced from reality and teaching being divorced from production. In order to solve the problem of improving the egg-laying rate of chickens, he has led teachers and students to conduct research by themselves since November last year, and finally succeeded in experimenting in the winter, when chickens do not often lay eggs, and the chickens can lay two eggs a day. Some scientific research work on improving the breed and habits of poultry has also been quickly carried out under his guidance and promotion. These new achievements in scientific research have been promptly supplemented into the teaching materials, making the teaching content richer.
    In order to do a good job in teaching, Professor He Dingjie also attaches great importance to ideological transformation. Every day, no matter how busy he is, he always takes time to study political current affairs. Although he is already an old man in his sixties, he never lets go of labor training. In order to take care of him, everyone does not let him participate in heavy physical labor, but he still tries to find ways to participate. Once, teachers and students went to repair a fish pond and agreed in advance not to tell him, but he still found out about it. That day, he took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and dug mud and carried soil with everyone, working really happily and being praised as "Old Huang Zhong."
    Professor He Dingjie actively and conscientiously does a good job in teaching and resolutely implements the Party's education policy, so he has been respected by teachers and students. All the teachers and students in the department actively care for him and are considerate of him. At night, when he stays in the student dormitory to tutor students in their homework, the students always urge him to go back to rest early and compete to send him back. Usually, teachers and students also try to give him a comfortable rest. The students not only regard him as a teacher, but also as their comrade and friend, actively discuss things with him, and often share happiness with him. Not long ago, Class 6263 participated in a school literary performance and won a plaster statue of Chairman Mao as a prize. So, everyone happily gave the prize to the old professor and wrote: "To our beloved Teacher He."

    老教授何定杰
    本报记者　殷平
    在武汉大学生物系的课堂内，实验农场里，和学生宿舍内，经常看到一位须发斑白的老教授，热情地指导学生作业和实习，耐心地为他们解答各种疑难问题。这位老教授就是著名的生物学家何定杰。他是一位从事教育工作四十年的老教授。几年来，由于他认真贯彻党的教育方针，不断提高教学质量，深得师生们的爱戴和尊敬，大家亲热地称呼他为“何老”。
    何定杰教授已有六十多岁了。当我访问他的时候，他感冒刚好，身体还没有完全复原。但一提起教学工作，他立即兴奋起来了。他说：“作为一个教师，我感到光荣和骄傲。”接着，他又一再地强调说：“教师的责任是重大的，特别是作为一个大学教授，培养出来的学生必须是‘成品’。教师的一举一动对青年人影响很大，如果在业务上、为人上不正确，都将造成损失。”他就是这样严格地要求自己，认真负责地进行教学工作的，即使在年迈体弱的晚年，也丝毫没有松懈，而且干劲是越来越足了。
    何定杰教授从青年时代起，就开始致力于生物学方面的教学和研究工作。早在二十年前，他为了掌握苏联的先进生物学理论，曾利用业余时间学会了俄文，然后又从理论上接受了米丘林学说。几十年来，他一直孜孜不倦地学习，因而获得了较丰富的理论知识，特别是在动物学方面。解放以后，他的工作更是越来越积极了，特别是对教学工作，简直可以说是丝毫不苟。他主动地参加教学小组，跟青年教师一起备课，一起讨论。在上课以前，还坚持在组内进行预讲，反复地听取教师、学生的意见，进行修改补充。下课以后，他又主动地深入到学生中间，征求意见，对教学中任何一个细小问题都不放松。有一次，他讲完动物穿山甲的生活习性后，有一个学生曾提出一个疑问，说他讲的与别的书上记载有出入。他回到家里后，就找寻了各种资料进行考查、研究，终于圆满地解答了这个问题。在过去，武汉大学的教授是从来不参加辅导和实验等工作的，但何定杰教授为了对学生全面负责，却主动地抽出时间进行辅导和实验指导工作。有时，一个星期抽出三个晚上，深入到学生宿舍里进行辅导，对一部分工农干部学生和基础较差的学生，辅导工作更细致，一遍又一遍地讲解也不厌其烦。而且，他还特别注意从辅导、实验中发现的问题，认真地研究和改进教学。有一次，他发现动物学中的一章，大家都懂得不透，问题很多。经他反复研究后，终于把原因找到了：主要是在教这一章时作实验太少了。于是，他立即设法予以改进，把问题解决了。特别是在近年来，何定杰教授还认真地作到联系实际，联系生产，经常下到实验家禽场里，参加生产劳动和科学研究，观察家禽的生活情况，充实到教材中去。在他的努力下，动物学的脱离实际、枯燥无味的现象已经根本改变，教学质量显著提高。
      “如果说，我在教学工作上，特别是在理论联系实际问题上还有些进步的话，那么该归功于党。”何定杰特别强调了这一点。的确，如何走理论联系实际的道路，如何使教学结合生产劳动，何定杰教授并不是一下就明确的，正如他自己说的：“当党提出教育必须与生产劳动相结合时，我虽然是拥护的，但具体作起来却是多么难啊！”
    去年10月间，生物系开始对资产阶级的学术思想进行批判。那时，何定杰心里想，自己一直是搞米丘林学说的，没有多大问题。可是，当学术批判开始以后，教师和学生都批判了他长期脱离生产、脱离实际，有为理论而理论的倾向。正在这个时候，党又及时地帮助他，学校党委肯定了他几十年认真作好教学工作的成绩，同时也向他指出：必须改变理论脱离实际的现象，才能走上又红又专的道路。
    何定杰冷静地考虑了党组织的指示和教师、学生的意见。当他想到米丘林一生工作六十年，经常参加生产劳动，创造了三百多个品种，从生产实践丰富了科学理论时，就感到自己作得还太少。特别是当他回想起1957年在青岛召开的全国遗传学会议上，自己不敢以米丘林派自居，讲话躲躲闪闪的情景，简直出了一身冷汗。可是为什么不敢呢？是自己怀疑米丘林吗？不是。而是自己实践知识少，拿不出足以服人的实例来论证啊！当他想到这些，越来越感到党的伟大、正确，感到群众意见正确，心情豁然开朗了。他说：“我感谢党在我晚年时期指出了正确的道路；也感谢那些向我提出批评的教师和学生，他们都是我的知心朋友，给我提出了宝贵的意见。” 
   从此，他的心情更加愉快，教学更加认真，并特别注意克服理论脱离实际、教学脱离生产的缺点。为了解决提高鸡子产蛋率的问题，他从去年11月起，就带领教师和学生，自己动手进行研究，而且终于在不常产蛋的冬季，试验成功，鸡子一天能生两个蛋。一些关于改良家禽品种、习性的科学研究工作，也都在他的指导、带动下，很快地搞起来了。这些科学研究的新成果，都被及时地补充到教材中去，使教学内容更加丰富了。
    为了搞好教学，何定杰教授还特别重视思想改造。每天，不论多忙，他总要抽出时间学习政治时事。虽然他已是六十多岁的老人了，但对劳动锻炼，也从不放过。大家为了照顾他，都不让他参加繁重的体力劳动，但他仍然想方设法参加。有一次，师生们去修鱼塘，事先曾相约不要告诉他，但还是被他知道了。到那天，他脱掉鞋袜，卷起裤管，和大家一起挖泥、挑土，干得真欢，被人誉称为“老黄忠”。
    何定杰教授积极认真搞好教学，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，因此受到了教师和学生的尊敬。全系教师和学生主动地关心他，体贴他。夜间，当他停留在学生宿舍辅导学生作业时，学生们总是催他早回去休息，并且争着送他。平时，教师和学生们也想法让他得到安适的休息。学生们不仅把他当作师长，也把他当作自己的同志和朋友，有事主动地跟他商量，并且经常地和他共欢乐。不久以前，六二六三班参加校内文艺演出时，获得了一个毛主席石膏像的奖品，于是，大家欢欢喜喜地把这奖品送给了老教授，并且写了：“送给我们敬爱的何老师。”
