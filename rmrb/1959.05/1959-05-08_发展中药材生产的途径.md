Ways to Develop the Production of Chinese Medicinal Materials
Pharmaceutical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health

　　In recent years, the production of Chinese medicinal materials has been continuously developing throughout the country. However, after the establishment of the people's communes, with the widespread establishment of rural medical and health institutions, especially with the further implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, the supply of Chinese medicinal materials still falls far short of actual needs. In order to accelerate the development of Chinese medicinal material production, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture have already formulated plans last year. However, to ensure the realization of this plan, there are still several issues that need to be resolved, based on the current situation.

　　First, most Chinese medicinal materials are plant-based, with a small portion derived from animals and minerals, and fundamentally belong to agriculture, relying on the production of thousands of collectively owned people's communes. The operation of the people's communes involves both self-sufficient and commodity production. The production of Chinese medicinal materials is beneficial to the development of the commodity economy of the people's communes, and should be combined with the diversified operations of the people's communes and developed in an organized manner. Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, in all places where conditions permit, the production of Chinese medicinal materials can be incorporated into the production plans of the communes. The agricultural departments and Chinese medicinal material management departments should also provide guidance to the production of the communes, so that they know what medicinal materials are needed by society, how much is needed, and when they are needed, and arrange production according to this situation; and provide assistance in equipment, funds, seeds, and technology.

　　Second, local production and local supply is the fundamental method for developing the production of Chinese medicinal materials and solving the supply problem. To achieve this, it is necessary to break the superstition of authentic medicinal materials and find ways to introduce and develop the production of authentic medicinal materials. Generally speaking, many places have the conditions to develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials. However, this does not mean that all places can be self-sufficient, or that major medicinal material producing areas only seek self-sufficiency. The characteristics of Chinese medicinal material production are decentralization and a wide variety of species. Therefore, all regions must conduct exchanges in a planned manner, regulate surpluses and deficiencies, and support each other. Doing so is not only beneficial to alleviating the current tight situation in the medicinal material market, but it will also be necessary in the future and even forever.

　　Third, actively and systematically transforming wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domesticated ones is a fundamental measure to develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials and solve the supply problem. In the past, Chinese medicinal materials were mostly taken from wild animals and plants, and production was very unstable. Currently, the demand for it is increasing, and it cannot meet the requirements. If we rely on collection for a long time, allowing them to grow and die naturally, there will always be a time when they are exhausted. Therefore, we must actively develop domestic breeding and cultivation. For some animal and plant medicinal resources that are difficult to domesticate or that are abundant in the mountains and fields, we must also organize and plan collection. And adopt policies to protect medicinal materials in the mountains and fields, and take measures such as planting as we collect.

　　Fourth, precisely because the production of Chinese medicinal materials relies on the people's communes, how to mobilize the enthusiasm of the collective, small collective, and individuals within the commune is also an important issue. For example, in Wuxi and Emei, Sichuan, certain large-volume, high-value perennial medicinal materials are managed by the commune, while general medicinal materials are managed by the production team organized professional teams (Chinese medicinal material production is highly technical, and organizing professional teams is appropriate); during the medicinal material collection season, when organizing large-scale collection teams for collection, the method of implementing commission bonuses for individuals is adopted. Usually, the collection by individuals and the planting in front of and behind the houses all belong to the individuals. The effect of this method is very good. Some medicinal materials, such as Coptis chinensis, require a long time to plant, a lot of investment, and several years to grow. Large-scale planting of this kind of medicinal material is more suitable for management by the commune management area. In mountainous areas, because there are many wild medicinal materials, scattered and dispersed, in addition to planning and organizing collection, the people's communes in mountainous areas must also mobilize individuals (such as the elderly and children) to collect. For the income from individual medicinal material collection, the method of most or all of it belonging to private individuals is implemented, in order to facilitate the mobilization of various positive factors and promote the development of Chinese medicinal material production.

　　Fifth, the price issue. Chinese medicinal materials have various different situations such as wild and domesticated, herbaceous and woody, perennial and annual, easy and difficult to plant, large and small yields, etc., and the principle of equivalent exchange should be implemented. In order to encourage the planting and collection of Chinese medicinal materials, the purchase price can be slightly higher than that of agricultural crops. The purchase prices of some medicinal materials are currently too low or too high, and appropriate adjustments should be made under the general spirit of stabilizing the prices of Chinese medicinal materials.

　　Finally, to develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, give prominence to politics, correctly implement the Party's relevant policies, and actively, planfully, and systematically develop production. At the same time, it is also necessary to adopt a series of two-pronged approaches and concrete measures to ensure that the production plan for Chinese medicinal materials is implemented reliably. While grasping production, all regions must also plan to organize the exchange of medicinal materials between regions, which is an important supplementary form in the country's more planned production and supply of Chinese medicinal materials. In order to ensure good exchanges in various regions, it is necessary to comprehensively promote the contract system.

　　发展中药材生产的途径
　　卫生部药政司
    几年来，全国的中药材生产有不断的发展。但是，在人民公社化以后，随着农村医疗卫生机构的普遍建立，特别是党的中医政策的进一步贯彻，中药材的供应还远远赶不上实际的需要。为了加速发展中药材生产，去年，卫生部和农业部已经制定了规划。但要保证这一规划的实现，从目前的情况看，还有几个问题需要解决。
    第一，中药材大部分是植物药，少部分取之动物和矿物，基本上属于农业，依靠千万个集体所有制的人民公社进行生产。而人民公社的经营是自给性生产和商品性生产并举，中药材生产对人民公社商品经济的发展有利，应该把它和人民公社的多种经营相结合，有组织地加以发展。在各级党委的统一领导下，在一切有条件的地方，都可以把中药材的生产纳入公社的生产计划。农业部门和中药材经营部门，也应该对公社的生产进行指导，使他们知道社会需要什么药材，需要多少，什么时候需要，根据这一情况来安排生产；并在设备、资金、种籽和技术等方面，予以协助。
    第二，就地生产就地供应是发展中药材生产、解决中药材供应问题的根本方法。要做到这点，就要破除对地道药材的迷信，想办法引种和发展地道药材的生产。一般说，很多地方都有发展中药材生产的条件。但这并不等于说一切地方都可以自供自给，或者主要产药地区也只求自足自给。中药材生产的特点是分散，品种十分繁多。因此，各地区必须有计划地进行交流，调剂有无，互相支援。这样做不仅对缓和目前药材市场的紧张情况有好处，而且，在将来甚至永远也是需要的。
    第三，积极地有步骤地变野生动植物药材为家养家种，是发展中药材生产，解决中药材供应问题的一个带根本性的措施。中药材过去多半取之于野生动物和植物，生产是很不稳定的，而目前对它的需要量又愈来愈大，不能适应要求。如果长期依靠采集，任其自生自灭，总有采完的时候，因此，必须积极发展家养家种。对于有些家养家种有困难，或在山野蕴藏很丰富的动植物药源，也要有组织、有计划地进行采集。并采取对山野药材保护的政策，采取随采随栽等措施。
    第四，正由于中药材的生产是依靠人民公社，如何把公社里的大集体、小集体和个人这几方面的积极性都调动起来，这也是一个重要问题。如四川巫溪、峨嵋实行的把某些大量的、价值大的多年生的药材，归社经营，一般的交由生产队组织药材专业队经营（中药材生产技术性很强，组织专业队是适宜的）；在药材采集季节，在组织大规模的采集队进行采集时，对个人实行提成分红的办法，平时个人采集的和房前屋后所种的都归个人所有，这个办法实行的效果很好。有些药材如黄连的种植，需要时间长，投资多，几年以后才能长成，这种药材的大面积种植归社管理区是比较适宜的。在山区，由于野生的药材多，零星分散，山区人民公社除了有计划地组织采集以外，也必须发动个人（如老人、小孩）采集，对个人采药的收入，实行大部或全部归私人所有的办法，以有利于动员各方面的积极因素，促进中药材生产的发展。
    第五，价格问题。中药材有野生和家种、草本和木本、多年生和当年生，种植有难有易，产量有大有小等种种不同的情况，应该执行等价交换的原则。为了鼓励中药材的种植和采集，收购的价格可以略高于农作物，现在有些药材的收购价格偏低偏高，应该在稳定中药材价格这一总的精神下，作适当的调整。
    最后，发展中药材生产，也必须各地党委加强领导，政治挂帅，正确地执行党的有关政策，积极地有计划有步骤地发展生产。同时，也必须采取一系列的两条腿走路的办法和具体措施，使中药材的生产计划落实可靠。各地在抓生产的同时，还须有计划地组织各地区之间的药材交流，这是国家对中药材更有计划进行生产和供应工作中的一项重要的补充形式。为了保证各地交流好，有必要全面推行合同制。
