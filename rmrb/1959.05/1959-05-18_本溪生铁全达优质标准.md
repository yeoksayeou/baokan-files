Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, May 17th: The Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which won the national collective championship for blast furnaces, has further improved the utilization coefficient of its blast furnaces. According to statistics from May 1st to 15th, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the plant reached 2.424, an increase of 5.16% compared to 2.305 in April, greatly exceeding the competition target of 2.3 proposed by them to blast furnace workers across the country in February this year. Due to the increase in the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, the plant has over-fulfilled the state's pig iron production plan by 1,450 tons in the past half month. The quality of pig iron has fully reached premium standards, and the qualification rate has increased from 98.98% in April to 100%.

In the national high-yield, high-quality blast furnace competition, the Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant has consistently led in blast furnace utilization coefficient. Entering May, the Party committee of this plant adopted a hands-on working method, handing over all the plant's production targets, planned technical measures, and possible difficulties to the workers for discussion. At the same time, the Party committee and administrative leaders organized workers from relevant units to promptly implement major technical measures that were decisive for increasing pig iron production. First, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, they further improved the raw material conditions of the blast furnace, changing the method of using coke in the blast furnace from the original mixed use of large and small pieces to graded and furnace-specific use. After No. 1 blast furnace adopted this material supply method on May 3rd, its utilization coefficient reached 2.583 in the first three days. In addition, they also adopted a major technical measure of increasing the tuyeres of the blast furnace, gradually expanding the existing tuyeres with a diameter of 140 mm to 180 mm, and changing the shape of the tuyeres from cylindrical to喇叭形的. In this way, the hot air sent into the blast furnace quickly and evenly reached the center of the furnace, expanding the scope of coke combustion, increasing the smelting intensity of the blast furnace, and correspondingly increasing the output of pig iron.

    本溪生铁全达优质标准
    新华社本溪17日电　荣获全国高炉集体冠军的本溪第一钢铁厂，高炉的利用系数又有提高。据5月1日到15日的统计，全厂高炉的平均利用系数达到二点四二四，比4月份的二点三○五提高了5.16％，已经大大超过了今年2月他们向全国高炉职工提出的利用系数二点三的竞赛指标。由于高炉利用系数的提高，全厂高炉半个月来已超计划为国家增产了生铁一千四百五十吨；生铁的质量全部达到优质的标准，合格率由4月份的98.98％提高到100％。
    在全国高炉优质高产竞赛中，本溪第一钢铁厂的高炉利用系数一直领先。进入5月，这个厂的党委采用一竿子扎到底的工作方法，把全厂的生产指标，计划采取的技术措施，以及可能遇到的困难，统统交给职工进行讨论。同时，党委和行政领导又组织有关单位的职工，抓紧实现对增产生铁有决定意义的重大技术措施。首先，他们根据苏联专家的建议，进一步改善高炉的原料条件，将高炉使用焦炭的办法由原来的大小块混合使用，改为分级分炉使用。一号高炉从5月3日采用这个供料办法后，头三天的高炉利用系数就达到二点五八三。此外，他们还采取加大高炉风口的重大技术措施，把高炉现有的直径一百四十公厘的风口，逐步扩大到一百八十公厘，同时把风口的形状由圆筒形改成喇叭形。这样，送进高炉的热风很快就均匀地送到炉的中心，扩大焦炭燃烧的范围，提高了高炉的冶炼强度，生铁的产量也相应地上升。
