　　Meticulously Weaving "Green Velvet", Striving to Seize the Red Flag
　　——A Record of Early Rice Field Management in Ganxi Brigade, Xiapu Commune
　　By Our Correspondent Zhou Rong

　　In April, the plum rain season, the fields of Ganxi Brigade in Xiapu Commune, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, are a lush green. The early rice is universally reviving, green, tender, and robust.

　　In the green fields, commune members are meticulously cultivating the early rice as if embroidering. Just as I stepped into the boundary of the brigade area, I ran into Brigade Leader Xiao Lusheng urging two commune members to carry a large earthenware jar, prepared for holding insecticide, to the early rice fields. Arriving at the field ridges, I saw an earthenware jar placed on each field ridge, filled with a mixture of insecticide made from glory lilies, yellow vine roots, wild amaryllis, and other ingredients. Looking down into the fields, many dead leeches were lying on the mud. Commune members told me that these fields had already been sprayed with insecticide once, and all the leeches, which could survive being cut into pieces after being exposed to the night dew, had died completely. Various rice pests, which are much weaker than leeches, would have no better fate.

　　Right in these fields, commune members were rushing to carry out the first round of inter-tillage and topdressing. Commune member Xiao Zhilin, holding an inter-tillage tool, pushed and pulled, completing another row. He challenged Lianying: "Sister Lianying, can you keep up with me?" "Okay, just watch!" Xiao Lianying and her partner Zeng Yuxiang, who were applying fertilizer, immediately sped up, their hands moving like shuttles, applying the ash fertilizer to the rice seedlings. At this time, Xiao Zhilin also accelerated the pace of inter-tillage. These sounds and actions of competition were also appearing in other fields.

　　At the entrance of each field, there were bamboo sticks holding maple branches and leaves as barriers, about two chi tall and three chi wide, allowing water from the upper fields to flow into the lower fields through the gaps in the barrier. I thought it was to prevent carp from escaping from the fields, but I was completely wrong. Xiao Qiulang, who was installing the barriers at the field entrances, told me that in previous years, the water from the upper fields would flow into the lower fields at a ninety-degree angle, washing away about twenty or thirty rice seedlings nearby, resulting in a loss of three to five jin of grain. Moreover, there was a kind of green caterpillar in the water that would swim into the fields and eat the rice. With these barriers in place, the water flowing out through the gaps would not damage the rice, and at the same time, the maple branches and leaves on the barriers were the natural enemies of the green caterpillars, killing them all on contact. What a meticulous and effective method!

　　Passing through Wazikou and Ganxizhou, I saw many canals and sand pits dug at the foot of the mountains to tame the mountain floods. Inside each field, a three-chi-wide canal with two-chi-high banks was dug, connecting the upper fields to the lower fields, all the way to the Ganxi River. Team cadre Zhu Zhangsheng, who was digging and reinforcing the canal banks, said: In previous years, even a little heavy rain would wash away dozens of mu of rice fields. This year, with the canals dug, even with last night's storm, the Ganxi River rose more than three chi, but not a single rice seedling in the fields was damaged. We have tamed the floodwaters! He also told me that these canals would be planted with arrowhead, which would grow bigger the more water flowed through them. A mu of land with canals could yield hundreds of jin of arrowhead, which is delicious and also increases the cash income of the commune members, truly killing two birds with one stone.

　　Mountain songs kept reaching my ears. Looking up at the mountains on both sides, I saw two children herding a group of cattle, happily singing mountain songs. Commune members explained that since the rice seedlings were planted in the fields, the children were afraid that the cattle would trample the seedlings, so they drove the cattle to the mountains to graze. The grass on the mountains is green, the cattle are strong, and there is no worry about the livestock trampling the rice.

　　This year, Ganxi Brigade finished planting the early rice half a month earlier than usual. On the third day after transplanting, Wang Xiaosheng, the secretary of the brigade's general party branch, went to the fields early in the morning. He inspected almost every field, not returning to the brigade office until the sun was setting. On the way, he recalled the inspection: all 937 mu of early rice fields were deeply plowed between eight cun and one chi, the fertile bubbles rolled out when his feet stepped into the fields, each mu was applied with a thousand dan of mixed refined fertilizer, and the close planting specifications were all 3 × 5 cun... This is a solid foundation for high yield! Instantly, his confidence increased a hundredfold, and he was full of energy. "Ah! From now on, as long as we grasp field management, add measures, and put in effort, we will surely have another bumper harvest in the fall!" Thinking of this, he decided to immediately convene a joint meeting of brigade cadres and veteran farmers that night to specifically study how to strengthen early rice field management.

　　That night, in the brigade office, a kerosene lamp shone brightly, with fifteen brigade committee members and veteran farmers like Wu Dehan sitting around the table. In fact, half of the brigade committee members were also veteran farmers. At the beginning of the meeting, Party General Branch Secretary Wang Xiaosheng introduced the situation of the day's inspection to everyone, making everyone's hearts bloom with joy. Then he said: "Starting well does not mean the end result. We must do a good job in cultivation and management to guarantee a good harvest." Then, he talked about an enlightening example: Last year, in the brigade where he was, there were two fields with completely identical conditions. One field was cultivated and managed very well, and the yield in the fall was equivalent to a thousand jin per mu; the other field was managed more loosely, and the yield in the fall was equivalent to more than four hundred and twenty jin per mu, a decrease of half. So everyone said in unison: "This is the truth. We must do a good job in field cultivation and strive for a bumper harvest!" That night, after research, everyone formulated detailed and specific cultivation and management plans for pest control, inter-tillage and weeding, topdressing, diligent drainage and irrigation, flood prevention, and waterlogging prevention, and dispersed late into the night.

　　The field management plan proposed by the brigade was warmly welcomed and supported by the commune members. Each production team quickly launched a field cultivation and management competition, and a heated competition also unfolded among the commune members. As soon as it dawned, the green early rice fields were bustling with activity, people showing their skills, inter-tilling, topdressing, pest control... chasing each other, seeing who could win the red flag that was fluttering in the wind.

　　I stayed here for three days; when I left, the more than nine hundred mu of early rice fields had all completed the first stage of field management, each task done as meticulously, solidly, and effectively as embroidery. The entire early rice field ridge looked like green velvet. General Branch Secretary Wang Xiaosheng said: The commune members are busy preparing fertilizers, lime, pesticides, tools, and other materials for the second early rice field management. After that, there will be a third and a fourth time.

　　精工织“绿绒”，奋力夺红旗
　　——记夏浦公社甘溪大队的早稻田间管理
　　本报记者　周荣
    黄梅四月，湖南衡山县夏浦公社甘溪大队的田间，一片青绿。早稻普遍回青，又绿又嫩又壮。
    绿色的田野上，社员们像绣花一样正在精致地培育早稻。我刚踏进大队地区的边界，正碰上大队长萧吕生在催喊两个社员，把准备用来装治虫药水的大瓦缸，抬到早稻田间去。来到田垅间，就看到每个田塍上放着一个瓦缸，里面装着杀虫的老虎花、黄藤根、野石蒜等混制的药水。俯视田里，沉在泥上的是许多已死的蚂蝗。社员告诉我，这些田已喷洒了一次治虫药水，平时碎尸经过夜露能活的蚂蝗全都死绝，比蚂蝗生命力微弱得多的各种水稻虫害，更没有好的下场。
    就在这些田里，社员们赶紧在进行头次中耕和追肥。社员萧志林拿着中耕器，一推一拉又搞好了一行。他向莲英挑战：“莲英妹子，你能追上我？”“好，你瞧着吧！”追肥的社员萧莲英和她的伙伴曾玉香，顿时加快了速度，双手如梭地把灰肥点到禾兜上。这时，萧志林也加快了中耕速度。这种竞赛的声音和行动，同时也出现在另一些田里。
    在每一丘田的口子边，都插有竹子别着枫树枝叶的拦帘，二尺来高三尺来宽，上田的水细细地经过帘缝流入下丘。我以为是田里放了鲤鱼，以防从田里逃走，谁知完全猜错了。正在插田口子拦帘的萧秋朗告诉我，往年，上田的水从田口子以九十度直角冲力流入下田，要冲死附近二、三十兜禾，少收三、五斤谷。而且水里有种咬禾的青虫，随水游到田里来吃禾。插上了这拦帘，从帘缝细细流出来的水就不会冲坏禾，同时，帘上的枫枝叶是青虫的对头，青虫碰着全死光。这是个多么细致而有效的办法！
    经过瓦子口和甘溪洲，看到山脚挖了很多驯服山洪的圳和沙氹，每丘田的里边，都挖了一条三尺宽、圳沿二尺高的过水圳，上田连下田，下田一直连到甘溪小河里。正在挖圳加固圳沿的队干部朱章生说：往年稍下一点大雨，就要冲垮几十亩稻田。今年挖了圳，昨天晚上暴风暴雨，甘溪小河水涨三尺多高，田里却没冲坏半兜禾。洪水渗水可被我们驯服了！他还告诉我，这条过水圳将全部栽上冰芕芋，水越冲它长得越大，一亩田的水圳面积可挖上百来斤芋头，很好吃，又增加了社员的现金收入，真是一举两得。
    山歌声不断送入我的耳朵，抬头一望两边山头，原来是两个小孩子在赶着一群牛，高兴地唱着山歌。社员解释着说，自从田里插上秧苗后，小孩子们怕牛踏坏了禾苗，便把牛都赶到山上去放牧，山上草又青、牛也壮，也不耽心牲畜踩坏禾了。
    今年，甘溪大队提早半个月插完了早稻。插完秧的第三天，大队总支书记王肖生，一早起来就往田间走去。他几乎逐丘都检查到了，直到太阳偏西才回大队办公室。路上他回想起检查时的情况来：九百三十七亩早稻田，全都深耕在八寸至一尺之间，当脚踩入田里时肥泡哗哗地滚出来，每亩足足下了千把担混合精肥，密植规格也都是3×5寸的……这是丰产的雄厚基础！顿时，信心增涨百倍，浑身是劲。“啊！从现在起只要抓住田间管理，加措施、加工夫，秋后准会又是大丰收！”想到这里，他决定晚上马上召开大队干部和老农联席会议，具体研究怎样加强早稻田间管理。
    晚上，在大队部的办公室里，一盏煤油灯亮堂堂的，围绕桌子坐着十五个大队委员和老农吴德汉等。其实，大队委员中也有半数是老农。会议开头，党总支书记王肖生向大家介绍了一天来检查的情况，说得大家心花怒放。接着他就说：“开始好并不等于定局，必须搞好培育管理，丰收才有保证。”然后，他谈了一桩有启发性的事例：去年他所在的大队，有两丘条件完全相同的田，一丘田培育管理得很好，秋后折合亩产千斤；另一丘培育管理松懈了一些，秋后折合亩产四百二十多斤，少收了一半。于是大家异口同声地说：“这是真言实语。一定要搞好田间培育，争取丰收！”这天晚上，大家经过研究，订出了杀虫、中耕除草、追肥、勤排勤灌、洪防、防渍等详细具体的培育管理计划，深夜才散去。
    大队提出的田间管理计划，得到了社员们热烈的欢迎和拥护。各生产队迅速搞起了田间培育管理竞赛运动，社员之间也展开了火热的竞赛。天一亮，绿色的早稻田间就热闹非凡，人们大显身手，中耕的、追肥的、杀虫的……你追我赶，看谁争得那正在迎风呼啦啦飘的红旗。
    我在这里停留了三天；离别时，九百多亩早稻田已经全部完成了田间管理的头道工夫，项项工夫像绣花一样搞得那样细致、扎实而有成效。整个早稻田垅，犹如青绿的天鹅绒。总支书记王肖生说：社员们又在忙着为第二次早稻田间管理准备肥料、石灰、农药、工具等物资。以后，还有第三次，第四次。
