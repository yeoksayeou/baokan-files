Give Full Play to the Enthusiasm and Creativity of Water and Electricity Workers
Committee Member Huang Minwei's Speech

Fellow Committee Members:

I fully agree with and support the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the Political Consultative Conference Work Report made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan at the first session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC.

All water and electricity workers across the country wholeheartedly support the State Council's order on dissolving the Tibet Local Government and suppressing the Tibetan rebellion. The former Tibet Local Government and the upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion betraying the motherland and splitting the unity of the motherland, arousing great indignation among the water and electricity workers across the country. Tibet has always been an inseparable part of our country's territory, and we will never allow a small number of Tibetan reactionaries to undermine the unity and solidarity of the motherland, and even more so, we will not allow imperialism and foreign reactionaries to interfere in our country's internal affairs. A handful of reactionaries betraying the motherland have been abandoned by the Tibetan and national people and have met with a shameful defeat. The imperialist and foreign reactionaries' conspiracy to interfere in our country's internal affairs will also be completely shattered. The Tibetan people have embarked on a new stage of building a happy life, and together with the people of the motherland, are marching towards a socialist society.

Now, I would like to make a speech on the achievements made by the water and electricity workers in the nationwide Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the production increase and conservation campaign centered on the technical revolution.

The Masses Exerted Enthusiasm and Creativity, Emerging in Numerous Innovation Stories and Advanced Experiences

In 1958, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the firm implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our national economy achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. The water and electricity production and construction undertaking also achieved unprecedented development. In terms of the power industry: the national power generation in 1958 reached 27.5 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 42% compared with 1957; the newly added power generation capacity was 1.79 million kilowatts, plus the newly built power stations in rural areas, equivalent to more than two-thirds of the power generation capacity added during the First Five-Year Plan period. In terms of water conservancy construction: in 1958, the country completed 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone works, expanding the irrigation area by 480 million mu. All these played a significant role in ensuring the realization of steel as the key link, and a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

In completing the above tasks, under the leadership of the Party, the water and electricity workers across the country launched a vigorous socialist emulation campaign of comparing with the advanced and competing for more, faster, better, and more economical results, exerted soaring enthusiasm and creativity, and emerged with thousands of advanced figures, creating numerous innovation stories and advanced experiences. For example, the workers of the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, in order to ensure the "marshal" of steel ascends to power and to adequately meet the electricity needs of industrial production, under the leadership of the Party, clearly established the idea of serving users and a high degree of political responsibility, launched a mass anti-accident struggle, deeply exposed and criticized the idea of not paying attention to safety, pulled out all accident seedlings, and formulated effective measures to ensure safe operation, thus achieving a record of two years of safe operation for the entire plant, creating rare achievements for large power plants. The workers of the Capital Shijingshan Power Plant, under the circumstances of the Great Leap Forward in production and tight power supply, broke with conventions, and through in-depth research and scientific experiments combining leadership, workers, and technicians, increased equipment output by 21%. This experience was quickly popularized. By the end of 1958, power plants across the country had tapped the potential of equipment up to more than 400,000 kilowatts. Another example is the Anshan Power Supply Bureau. In order to ensure uninterrupted power supply for industrial production, after repeated experiments and overcoming various conservative ideas with the joint efforts of comrades such as Liu Changgeng, they finally successfully created a set of tools and operating methods for live-line maintenance of high-voltage lines, which not only ensured safe operation, but also supplied more electricity. In terms of power station construction, compared with the First Five-Year Plan period, the construction period was generally shortened by about half. Individual power stations, such as the 6,000-kilowatt turbine generator unit installation at the Wangting Power Plant, took only a few dozen hours, creating an unprecedented record of rapid installation. The workers fighting on the Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub project, under the correct leadership of the Party, emancipated their minds, broke with superstition, constantly struggled against right-leaning conservative ideas, and launched a competition movement mainly focused on technical revolution, continuously breaking through three barriers (namely, whether construction can start, whether a leap forward can be achieved, and whether the river can be blocked). As a result, the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub project has achieved leap forwards again and again. The original plan was to complete it in 1962, but now it is planned to block the flood and store water in 1960 and generate electricity in 1961.

The above examples fully demonstrate that as long as we resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, conscientiously implement the Party's unified leadership, adhere to putting politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, vigorously promote technical revolution, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, we can create great miracles.

There is Great Potential for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy; The Key Lies in Continuing to Mobilize the Masses and Vigorously Promote Technical Revolution

The 1959 National Economic Plan, which was passed by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the plenary session of the State Council, and submitted to this conference for deliberation, is a plan for a continued Great Leap Forward. It fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

The scale of the water conservancy and electricity production and construction plan in 1959 is also very grand. There are a total of 28 water conservancy construction projects above the national quota under construction; expanding the irrigation area by 100 million mu. There are a total of 184 new and expanded basic construction projects of water and thermal power stations above the national quota, which is more than all the engineering projects of the power industry above the national quota during the First Five-Year Plan period. This year, the planned power generation is 40 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 45% compared with 1958. Realizing this grand plan is very glorious, but there are also certain difficulties. However, we firmly believe that as long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, exert greater effort, carry out a production increase and conservation campaign centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, increase production, practice strict economy, oppose waste, and rapidly increase labor productivity, we can overcome all difficulties and complete and over-fulfill the national plan more, faster, better, and more economically.

At present, carrying out the production increase and conservation campaign in the water and electricity system is not only necessary, but also entirely possible. There is great potential in both production units and basic construction units. For example, in power plants, there are units with more than 600 days of safe operation, workshops with more than 2,000 days, and teams with more than 4,000 days, but there are also units that constantly experience accidents. In terms of economic indicators, taking March of this year as an example, for the same high-pressure heating power plant, some plants consume only 0.317 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour, while others consume 0.516 kg, a difference of 0.199 kg. In hydropower construction units, the potential for manpower, materials, and equipment is also very large. For example, the design allows 20% to 30% for the filling of rubble, but this standard is generally not achieved. If all hydropower projects can meet this standard, not only can a large amount of cement be saved, but also the project cost can be greatly reduced and the project quality can be improved. In short, as long as we fully exert the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, vigorously promote technical revolution and technical innovation, do everything possible to improve tools and equipment, improve design, improve operating methods and labor organization, eliminate weak links in production, and launch a production increase and conservation campaign centered on technical revolution and technical innovation, we can rapidly improve labor productivity, thereby completing the national plan more, faster, better, and more economically.

The determining factor and central link in carrying out the production increase and conservation campaign is to fully exert the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and vigorously promote technical revolution. Therefore, we must closely rely on the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, continue to emancipate our minds, break with superstition, and struggle against various conservative and backward ideas. Closely focus on the center of production, focus on the key problems in production, and with advanced producers and veteran workers as the backbone, continue to implement the method of combining leadership, workers, and technicians, launch a mass upsurge of technical revolution and technical innovation, break through the weak links that hinder the rapid increase of production and construction, and promote the sustained development of the production increase and conservation campaign. For example, the leaders of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau personally went to the site. Based on the needs of engineering construction, through the method of combining leadership, workers, and technicians, they modified the design of the upstream cofferdam, which alone reduced the workload of more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, saved a lot of manpower and materials, and accelerated the progress of the project. Another example is the Jixi Power Plant, which mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and vigorously promoted technical revolution, improved equipment and operating methods, burned inferior coal, and reduced the cost of power generation. From 16.63 yuan per thousand kilowatt-hours in 1957, it was reduced to 12.84 yuan, creating a new record in the country for reducing the cost of thermal power generation. Practice has proved that under the leadership of the Party, carrying out mass activities of technical innovation and technical revolution can solve the key problems in production and rapidly improve production efficiency.

In order to make the production increase and conservation campaign develop in a sustained and in-depth manner, we must extensively launch socialist emulation. Socialist emulation is an effective method for fully exerting the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and rapidly increasing labor productivity. It is an important measure to continuously solve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward. Like the development of other things, the difference between the advanced and the backward in production and construction is often existing. Therefore, in the process of competition, we must continuously summarize and promote advanced experience, establish models, and hold high the banner of the advanced. Stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and launch a mass upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Turn the production level of the original few advanced people into the social production level.

In order to carry out the production increase and conservation campaign in a sustained manner, we must follow the instructions of the Party, and while striving to do a good job in production, care about the political and material life of the masses. Under the unified leadership of the Party, combined with the reality of production, educate workers to improve their awareness, take politics as the driving force, adhere to putting politics in command, and promote the continuous development of production. At the same time, we must follow the instructions of the Party, closely combine production and life, combine tense labor with appropriate rest, so that the workers can eat well, sleep well, and maintain full spirit and high labor enthusiasm on the tense production front, so that production can advance in waves.

The notice from the Party Central Committee and the State Council to convene a national conference of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the fourth quarter of this year has greatly encouraged the water and electricity workers across the country, and their labor enthusiasm has become even higher, and they are working even harder. At present, in the water and electricity system, an upsurge of socialist red flag competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has been launched. Creating new achievements, striving to go to Beijing, meeting the leader Chairman Mao, and winning glory at the heroes' meeting have become the common aspirations of the vast number of water and electricity workers, and have become the driving force for promoting the current production and construction. Under the correct leadership of the Party, we must resolutely implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, exert great effort, strive for the upper reaches, and we will definitely be able to complete and over-fulfill the 1959 water conservancy and electricity production and construction plan, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

    发挥水利电力职工的积极性创造性
    黄民伟委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告和李维汉副主席在政协第三届首次会议上所作的政协工作报告。
    全国水利电力职工衷心拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和平息西藏叛乱的命令。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，发动背叛祖国、分裂祖国统一的反革命叛乱，引起全国水利电力职工的极大愤慨。西藏从来就是我国领土的一部分，我们决不允许西藏少数反动分子破坏祖国的统一和团结，更不允许帝国主义和外国反动派干涉我国的内政。一小撮背叛祖国的反动分子已遭到西藏和全国人民的唾弃与可耻的失败，帝国主义和外国反动派妄图干涉我国内政的阴谋也必将遭到彻底破灭，西藏人民从此走上了建设幸福生活的新阶段，和祖国人民一道，向社会主义社会迈进。
    现在我仅就水利电力职工在一九五八年全国大跃进中所取得的成就和开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动作以下发言。
    群众发挥积极性和创造性，出现无数革新事迹和先进经验
    一九五八年，由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导坚决贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线，我国国民经济获得了历史上从未有过的大跃进。水利电力生产建设事业，也获得了空前的发展。在电力工业方面：一九五八年全国发电量达二百七十五亿度，比一九五七年增长了百分之四十二；新增发电能力一百七十九万瓩，加上农村新建电站，等于第一个五年计划期间所增加的发电能力的三分之二以上。在水利建设方面：一九五八年全国共完成土石方工程五百八十亿公方，扩大灌溉面积四点八亿亩。所有这些，对保证实现以钢为纲，工农业生产全面大跃进起了重大作用。
    在完成上述任务中，全国水利电力职工，在党的领导下，开展了轰轰烈烈的比先进、比多快好省的社会主义竞赛运动，发挥了冲天的干劲和创造性、积极性，涌现了成千上万的先进人物，创造了无数的革新事迹和先进经验。例如上海杨树浦发电厂的职工群众，为了保证钢铁“元帅”升帐，适当满足工业生产的用电需要，在党的领导下，明确地树立了为用户服务的思想与高度的政治责任感，开展了群众性的反事故斗争，深入揭发与批判了不重视安全的思想，拔出了一切事故苗子，并制订了保证安全运行的有效措施，因而出现了全厂安全运行两年的纪录，创造了大型电厂少有的成绩。首都石景山发电厂的职工群众在生产大跃进、电源紧张的情况下，打破常规，经领导、工人、技术人员三结合的深入研究和科学试验，提高了设备出力达百分之二十一。这一经验迅速得到推广，到一九五八年底全国发电厂已挖出设备潜力达四十多万瓩。又如鞍山供电局职工为了保证工业生产上不间断的用电，经刘长庚等同志共同努力，多次试验，战胜了各种各样的保守思想，终于创造成功了一套不停电检修高压线路的工具和操作方法，不仅保证了安全运行，又多供了电。在电站建设方面，与第一个五年计划期间比较，一般都缩短了工期一半左右，个别电站像望亭发电厂六千瓩汽轮机组安装只用了几十小时，创造了过去从来未有过的快速安装纪录。战斗在黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程上的职工群众，在党的正确领导下，解放了思想，破除了迷信，不断向右倾保守思想进行斗争，开展了以技术革命为主要内容的竞赛运动，连续突破三关（即能否开工，能否跃进，能否截流），结果使三门峡水利枢纽工程一再跃进，原计划一九六二年竣工，现在计划提前到一九六○年拦洪蓄水，一九六一年发电。
    以上事例充分说明，只要我们坚决执行党的社会主义建设总路线，认真贯彻党的统一领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，发扬群众的积极性与创造性，就能创造出伟大的奇迹。
    增产节约潜力很大，关键在于继续发动群众，大闹技术革命
    经中国共产党八届七中全会和国务院全体会议通过，提交这次大会审议的一九五九年国民经济计划是一个继续大跃进的计划。它充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    一九五九年水利电力生产建设计划的规模也是非常宏伟的。全国施工的限额以上的水利建设项目共二十八项；扩大灌溉面积一亿亩。新建扩建限额以上的水、火电站基本建设项目共一百八十四项，比第一个五年计划期间电力工业的全部限额以上工程项目还多，今年计划发电量四百亿度，比一九五八年增长百分之四十五。实现这一宏伟计划是非常光荣的，然而也有一定的困难，但是我们深信只要紧紧依靠党的领导，坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，鼓足更大干劲，开展以技术革新与技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，增加生产，厉行节约，反对浪费，迅速提高劳动生产率，就能战胜一切困难，多快好省地完成与超额完成国家计划。
    目前在水利电力系统开展增产节约运动，不仅是必需的，而且也是完全可能的，无论在生产单位或者基本建设单位，潜力都很大。比如在发电厂方面有安全运行六百多天的单位，二千多天的车间，四千多天的小组，但也有经常不断发生事故的单位。在经济指标方面，以今年三月份为例，同样的高压供热电厂，有的厂一度电只耗煤零点三一七公斤，有的厂却耗煤零点五一六公斤，相差达零点一九九公斤。在水电建设单位中，人力、物力、设备器材的潜力也是非常大的，例如填充毛石，按设计允许百分之二十到百分之三十，可是一般都达不到这个标准，如果所有水电工程都能达到这个标准，不仅可以节约大量水泥，还可以大大降低工程造价与提高工程质量。总之，只要我们充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，大闹技术革命和技术革新，千方百计地改良工具和设备，改进设计，改善操作方法与劳动组织，消除生产上的薄弱环节，掀起以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动，就能迅速提高劳动生产率，从而多快好省地完成国家计划。
    开展增产节约运动的决定因素与中心环节，是充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，大闹技术革命。因此，我们必须紧紧依靠党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，继续解放思想，破除迷信，同各种各样的保守落后的思想进行斗争。密切围绕生产中心，针对生产上的关键问题，以先进生产者与老工人为骨干，继续执行领导、工人、技术人员三结合的方法，掀起群众性的技术革命与技术革新高潮，突破障碍生产建设迅速提高的薄弱环节，以推动增产节约运动的持久发展。例如，三门峡工程局领导亲临现场，根据工程建设上的需要，通过领导、工人、技术人员三结合的方法，修改了上游围堰设计，仅此一项就减少了三十多万土石方的工作量，节约了大量人力、器材，还加速了工程进度。另如鸡西发电厂发动群众，依靠群众，大闹技术革命，改进了设备和操作方法，大烧劣煤，降低了发电成本。由一九五七年每千度电十六点六三元，降到十二点八四元，创造了全国火力发电降低成本的新纪录。实践证明，在党的领导下，开展技术革新和技术革命的群众性活动，生产上的关键就会迎刃而解，生产效率就会迅速提高。
    为了使增产节约运动持久深入发展，必须广泛展开社会主义竞赛。社会主义竞赛是充分发挥群众积极性与创造性，迅速提高劳动生产率的有效方法。它是不断解决先进与落后矛盾的重要措施。生产建设也和其他事物的发展一样，先进与落后的差别是经常存在的。因此在竞赛的过程中，必须不间断地总结与推广先进经验，树立标兵，高举先进旗帜。激发群众的积极性与创造性，掀起群众性的比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛热潮。使原来少数先进者的生产水平，成为社会生产水平。
    为了把增产节约运动持久地开展下去，我们必须遵照党的指示，在努力搞好生产的同时，关心群众的政治生活和物质生活。在党的统一领导下，结合生产实际，教育职工提高觉悟，以政治为动力，坚持政治挂帅，推动生产的不断发展。同时，必须遵照党的指示，把生产和生活密切结合起来，把紧张的劳动与适当的休整结合起来，使职工群众在紧张的生产战线上，吃得好、睡得好，保持饱满的精神与高度的劳动热情，使生产一浪高一浪的向前推进。
    党中央和国务院决定今年第四季度召开全国先进集体和先进生产者代表会议的通知，给全国水利电力职工极大的鼓舞，劳动热情更加高涨了，干劲更足了。目前在水利电力系统，已经掀起了一个比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义红旗竞赛高潮。创造新成绩，争取上北京，会见领袖毛主席，群英会上争光荣，已经成为广大水利电力职工群众普遍的愿望，已经成为推动当前生产建设的动力。我们一定在党的正确领导下，坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定能够完成与超额完成一九五九年水利电力生产建设计划，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
