Interfering in China's Internal Affairs is Foolish!
Lu Shaowu Warns Indian Interventionists

I fully endorse the government work report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country has become a closely united family of all nationalities. This is the most gratifying thing in our domestic political life. The great achievements since the First National People's Congress and the comprehensive leap forward in industry, agriculture, culture, and education in 1958 have demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and proved that the socialist road is the road to common development and prosperity for all nationalities in our country. It has further encouraged all nationalities in our country to work together with great confidence and vigor to strive for the realization of the 1959 national economic plan.

Recently, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique betrayed the motherland, staged an armed rebellion, and kidnapped the Dalai Lama. This small group of reactionaries colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to become enemies of the people of the motherland, arousing the unparalleled anger of the people of Tibet and the whole country. Like the people of all nationalities in the country, the people of all nationalities in our Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region fully support the measures taken by the Central People's Government: dissolving the original Tibetan local government and ordering the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to quell the rebellion. We, the people of all nationalities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, are very pleased with the patriotic actions of the Tibetan monks and laypeople who actively support the People's Liberation Army and the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army, which quickly and fundamentally quelled the rebellion.

Indian interventionists, you place your hopes on a small group of rebels, interfere in our country's internal affairs, and attempt to achieve the goal of invading Tibet. This is wishful thinking. Your calculations are wrong. You will not get any benefits. The so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials speaks the words of those with ulterior motives, full of loopholes and not worth refuting. This statement advocates Tibetan "independence," which is the same tune as the "Tibetan independence" advocated by British imperialism in its aggression against Tibet in modern history. Some Indian political party leaders and official figures, including Narain of the Socialist Party, Indira Gandhi, President of the Congress Party, and Mrs. Kripalani, Secretary-General of the Congress Party, openly refer to Tibet as a "country" and the rebellion as "national sentiment" and a "just cause." We want to ask: Why are these people so interested in "Tibetan independence" and opposed to Chinese unity and national solidarity, and why do they show sympathy for a small group of Tibetan rebels while opposing the more than 1.1 million patriotic monks and laypeople in Tibet? Is this not an attempt to use those rebels to rule the Tibetan people, maintain the dark serf system, and split Tibet from China, making Tibet a colony of ambitious people in reality? Their attempt can be completely seen through.

Imperialists and foreign reactionaries are not reconciled to the liberation of the Chinese people, and they always hope for China's division.

We want to point out that the conspiracies of Indian interventionists and imperialists will never succeed. The people of all nationalities in our country have united to retaliate against them.

Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and the Tibetan people are a member of the national family of our country. According to the Party's nationality policy and the state's system, the Tibetan people should realize national regional autonomy. Now that the Tibetan rebels have been basically eliminated, the stumbling block hindering national regional autonomy has been removed, which is very beneficial to accelerating the realization of regional autonomy. According to our experience, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the help of the Han people, the policy of national regional autonomy has been implemented, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been established. The realization of the autonomous rights of minority nationalities has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities in the autonomous region to build socialism, accelerated the political, economic, and cultural development of minority nationalities, and caught up with the level of advanced nationalities. We can fully foresee that after the establishment of the autonomous region in Tibet, under the leadership of the Party, the enthusiasm of the Tibetan people will be fully utilized, and with the help of the Han and other nationalities, the political, economic, and cultural development of the Tibetan people will surely develop rapidly.

The broad masses of monks and laypeople in Tibet have successively put forward demands, hoping to gradually carry out democratic reforms in Tibet, liberate Tibet from the serf system, and then build a new socialist Tibet. Before liberation, the people of all nationalities in our Guangxi were also deeply oppressed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. We can fully understand the pain and feelings of the Tibetan people under the serf system. We fully sympathize with the Tibetan people's desire to gradually carry out democratic reforms and socialist construction.

In our political life, we have deeply realized that if any nation wants to develop its culture, prosper its economy, and rank among the most advanced nations in the world, it must first resolutely carry out revolutionary movements against imperialism and feudalism. Like the people of all nationalities in the country, the people of all nationalities in our Guangxi have carried out long and arduous revolutionary struggles against imperialist aggression and feudal oppression since the Opium War. In the Qing Dynasty, the people of all nationalities in our Guangxi united to resist foreign enemies. In the area of Munanguan, the French invading army was beaten to the ground, which was the Sino-French War that shook China and foreign countries. At the same time, in the struggle against feudalism, we also wrote a great epic. The famous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution started from Jintian Village in Guangxi. Later, the Xinhai Revolution and the anti-Yuan movement were enthusiastically participated in by the people of Guangxi. After the founding of the Communist Party of China, the people of Guangxi fought for the new democratic revolution under the banner of the Communist Party of China. The Red Seventh Army was composed of the sons and daughters of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi. After the Red Seventh Army joined forces with the Central Red Army directly led by Chairman Mao in Jiangxi, it fought north and south, fighting alongside the people of all nationalities across the country for the liberation of all of China. The revolutionary aspirations of the people of Guangxi were not truly realized until the completion of land reform and the three major socialist transformations. The people of all nationalities in our Guangxi also personally experienced that after we realized the wishes of land reform and the three major socialist transformations, the productive forces that had been bound for a long time were greatly liberated, and the speed of socialist construction greatly increased, so that during the first five-year plan period, especially in last year's Great Leap Forward, we were able to achieve unprecedented great achievements like all parts of the country.

In 1958, the people of all nationalities in our region, with soaring energy and selfless labor, threw themselves into the great battle of socialist construction and realized a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the entire region reached 4.756 billion yuan, an increase of 95 percent over 1957.

On the agricultural front, the total grain output reached 22.9 billion jin, doubling that of 1957, and the task of producing 800 jin per mu was completed ahead of schedule. Economic crops, forestry, and animal husbandry production have also made great progress. For example, sugarcane production increased by 189.63 percent over 1957; the afforestation area reached 20.09 million mu, an increase of 563.7 percent over 1957; and the number of live pigs increased by 43.83 percent over 1957.

On the industrial front, due to our implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, the total investment in industrial capital construction increased by 267.5 percent over 1957, and a total of 985 industrial capital construction projects were started; in the vigorous mass movement to develop iron and steel, more than 5 million people in the entire region joined the battle, and in just a few months, more than 150,000 tons of iron and steel were produced, and the output of raw coal reached 3.5 million tons, an increase of 573.08 percent over 1957. County and commune industries have been greatly developed. There are more than 41,000 factories and mines with a certain scale, employing more than 700,000 workers and staff, and a strong rural industrial force has been initially formed.

Due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, people's cultural life has also been significantly improved. The number of students in institutions of higher learning reached 11,667, an increase of three times over 1957; the number of students in secondary schools reached 406,704, an increase of more than one time over 1957. Mass cultural life has witnessed unprecedented prosperity.

On the basis of the great leap forward in production and the great improvement in the communist ideological consciousness of the broad masses of the people, in August 1958, the broad masses of rural areas in our region realized the people's commune. From the day it was built, the people's commune showed its strong vitality and great superiority. Millions of farmers wholeheartedly support the people's commune and regard it as the source of their happy life. In order to develop production at a high speed, people of all nationalities have widely carried out large-scale cooperation between communes and counties, supporting and learning from each other, greatly promoting mutual understanding among people of all nationalities, gradually eliminating historical barriers, and further consolidating the unprecedented unity among nationalities and socialist national relations.

According to the practical experience of our Guangxi people in carrying out the new democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction, social reform is the only way for the people of all nationalities in our country to develop and progress, quickly embark on socialism, and get rid of poverty and backwardness. Because only by changing the old and backward social system can we establish a socialist social system, thoroughly liberate the productive forces, improve the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, and develop economic and cultural construction at a high speed. Therefore, we can foresee that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the joint efforts of the Tibetan and other nationalities, once Tibet carries out democratic reforms and moves forward along the broad road of socialism, its economic and cultural development will inevitably be rapid. A beautiful and prosperous new Tibet will appear in the near future! We, the people of Guangxi, are delighted for this glorious future of the Tibetan people. May we, together with the Tibetan people and the people of all nationalities across the country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, contribute our greater strength and make greater achievements to further strengthen the unity of the motherland, strengthen national unity, the great socialist construction cause of our motherland, and the prosperity and happiness of our people of all nationalities!

　　干涉我国内政是愚蠢的！
    卢绍武代表警告印度那些干涉主义分子
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    解放以来，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国已经成为各民族亲密团结的大家庭，这是国内政治生活中最可喜的事情。第一届人民代表大会以来的伟大成就，一九五八年工农业、文教事业的全面大跃进，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越，证明了社会主义道路是我国各民族共同发展和繁荣的道路，更加鼓舞了我国各民族以极大的信心和干劲，共同努力，为实现一九五九年国民经济计划而奋斗。
    最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团背叛祖国，武装叛乱，并且劫持了达赖喇嘛，这一小撮反动分子勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，与祖国人民为敌，激起了西藏和全国人民的无比愤怒。我们广西僮族自治区各族人民同全国人民一样，完全拥护中央人民政府所采取的措施：解散原西藏地方政府，命令驻藏人民解放军削平叛乱。对于西藏僧俗人民积极支援人民解放军的爱国行动和人民解放军英勇善战，迅速地基本平息了叛乱，我们广西僮族自治区各族人民感到非常高兴。
    印度的干涉主义分子，你们把希望寄托在一小撮叛乱分子身上，干涉我国内政，企图达到侵略西藏的目的，这是痴心妄想。你们的算盘打错了。你们不会得到任何好处。由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，说的是别有用心的人的话，漏洞百出，不堪一驳。这个声明鼓吹西藏“独立”，和近代史上英帝国主义侵略西藏所鼓吹的“西藏独立”的调子是一样的。印度一些政党负责人和官方人物，包括社会党的纳拉扬，国大党主席英迪拉，甘地夫人，国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人，公然把西藏说成是“国家”，把叛乱说成是“民族情绪”“正义事业”。我们要问：为什么这些人对于“西藏独立”那样感到兴趣，而对于中国统一，民族团结，则表示反对，对于西藏一小撮叛乱分子那样寄与同情，而对于西藏一百一十多万爱国的僧俗人民则表示反对，这难道不是为了企图利用那些叛乱分子统治西藏人民，维持黑暗的农奴制度，并把西藏从中国分裂出去，使西藏实际上变成野心家的殖民地吗？他们这种企图是完全可以看出来的
    帝国主义者和外国反动派，是不甘心中国人民解放的，他们总是希望中国分裂。
    我们要指出：印度的干涉主义者和帝国主义者，他们的阴谋是绝不会得逞的，我国各族人民已经一致起来给他们以回击。
    西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，藏族人民是组成我国民族大家庭的一个成员。按照党的民族政策和国家的制度，藏族人民应当实现民族区域自治，现在西藏叛乱分子基本被肃清了，阻碍民族区域自治的绊脚石被搬掉了，对于加速实现区域自治，是非常有利的。根据我们的经验，在党和毛主席的领导下，加上汉族人民的帮助，实行民族区域自治的政策，建立了广西僮族自治区，实现少数民族自治权利，大大提高了自治区内各族人民建设社会主义的积极性，加速了少数民族政治、经济和文化的发展，赶上先进民族的水平，我们完全可以预见到在西藏建立了自治区以后，在党的领导下，充分发挥藏族人民的积极性，加上汉族及其他各族人民的帮助，藏族人民的政治、经济、文化一定能够迅速地发展起来。
    西藏的广大僧俗人民，纷纷提出要求，希望在西藏逐步进行民主改革，将西藏从农奴制度下解放出来，进而建设社会主义的新西藏。我们广西各族人民，在解放以前，也深受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，对处在农奴制度下的西藏人民的痛苦与心情，是完全可以理解的。我们十分同情西藏人民对于逐步进行民主改革与进行社会主义建设的愿望。
    在我们的政治生活中，深深体会到，任何民族，要发展文化，繁荣经济，使跻于现代最先进的民族之列，首先必须坚决进行反对帝国主义与封建主义的革命运动。和全国人民一样，我们广西各族人民，自鸦片战争以来，进行过长期反对帝国主义侵略与封建主义压迫的艰苦的革命斗争。在清朝，我们广西各族人民，曾经联合起来，一致抵抗外敌。在睦南关一带，曾将法国侵略军打得落花流水，这就是震动中外的中法战争；同时，我们在反封建主义的斗争中，也写成了伟大的史诗，有名的太平天国革命，就是从广西金田村打起来的，以后的辛亥革命、讨袁运动，广西人民无不热烈参与。中国共产党成立后，广西人民就在中国共产党的旗帜下，为新民主主义的革命而奋斗，红七军就是广西各族人民的子弟兵。红七军在江西与当时毛主席直接领导的中央红军会师后，便转战南北，与全国各族人民一道为解放全中国而斗争。广西人民的革命愿望，实际上直到土地改革与三大社会主义改造的完成才得到实现。我们广西各族人民又亲自体会到，当我们实现了土地改革与三大社会主义改造的愿望之后，原来长期受到束缚的生产力就大为解放，社会主义建设的速度也就大大的增加，从而使我们在第一个五年计划期间，特别是去年的大跃进中，能够同全国各地一样，取得史无前例的伟大成绩。
    一九五八年，我区各族人民，以冲天的干劲和忘我的劳动，投入了社会主义建设的伟大战斗，实现了工农业生产的大跃进，全区工农业总产值达到四十七点五六亿元，比一九五七年增长了百分之九十五。
    在农业战线上，粮食总产量达到了二百二十九亿斤，比一九五七年翻了一番，提前完成了亩产八百斤的任务；经济作物、林业和畜牧生产，也都有了很大的发展。如：甘蔗产量比一九五七年增长百分之一百八十九点六三：造林面积达二千零九十万亩，比一九五七年增长百分之五百六十三点七；生猪比一九五七年增长了百分之四十三点八三。
    在工业战线上，由于我们贯彻执行了全党全民大办工业的方针，工业基建投资总额比一九五七年增长了百分之二百六十七点五，开始施工的工业基建项目共有九百八十五个；在轰轰烈烈的大搞钢铁的群众运动中，全区有五百多万人投入了战斗，在短短的几个月内，生产了钢铁十五万多吨，原煤产量达到三百五十万吨，比一九五七年增长了百分之五百七十三点零八。县、社工业得到很大的发展，稍具规模的厂矿约有四万一千多个，拥有职工七十多万人，初步组成了一支强大的农村工业队伍。
    由于工农业生产的飞跃发展，人民的文化生活也有了显著的提高，高等学校学生达到一万一千六百六十七人，比一九五七年增长了三倍；中等学校学生达到四十万六千七百零四人，比一九五七年增长了一倍多。群众性的文化生活出现了空前的繁荣景象。
    在生产大跃进和广大人民共产主义思想觉悟大大提高的基础上，一九五八年八月间，我区广大农村，实现了人民公社化。人民公社从建成的那一天起，就显示了它具有强大的生命力和极大的优越性。千百万农民衷心地拥护人民公社，把它看作自己幸福生活的泉源。为了高速度地发展生产，各族人民广泛开展了社与社、县与县之间的大协作，互相支援，互相学习，大大促进了各族人民之间的了解，逐步消除了历史上遗留下来的隔阂，民族之间空前团结，社会主义的民族关系进一步巩固。
    根据我们广西人民进行新民主主义革命、社会主义革命与社会主义建设的实践经验，社会改革是我国各族人民得以发展进步，迅速走上社会主义，摆脱贫困落后的唯一道路。因为只有改变了旧的落后的社会制度，才能建立起社会主义的社会制度，才能彻底解放生产力，提高广大人民的政治热情，高速度发展经济、文化建设事业。因此，我们可以预见到：在中国共产党的领导下，在藏族及其他各族人民的共同努力下，西藏一经进行了民主改革，沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进，其经济、文化的发展必然会一日千里。一个美丽的繁荣的新西藏，在不久的将来就会出现！我们广西人民，为西藏人民这一光辉前途而感到欢快。愿我们与西藏人民，全国各族人民在共产党及毛泽东主席的领导下，为进一步加强祖国的统一，加强民族的团结，为我们祖国的伟大的社会主义建设事业，为我们各族人民的繁荣幸福贡献出我们更大的力量，作出更大的成绩吧！
