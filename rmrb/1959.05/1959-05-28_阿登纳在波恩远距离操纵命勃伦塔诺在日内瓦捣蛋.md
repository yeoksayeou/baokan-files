Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: The "Neues Deutschland" newspaper reported on May 13th, revealing how Adenauer tightly controlled the West German delegation attending the Geneva Conference. The newspaper cited a report from Agence France-Presse, stating that, according to the West German delegation, Adenauer had given Brentano a stern order over the phone: under no circumstances should he enter the League of Nations building, so as to avoid meeting with representatives of the German Democratic Republic.

The newspaper said that Brentano frequently kept in contact with Adenauer by telephone at his villa in Geneva. The fact that the West German Chancellor was remotely controlling the Bonn delegation has long been the subject of vignettes by many foreign journalists. One British journalist sarcastically said, "Apparently, Brentano cannot independently issue instructions to Eckardt, the (West German) Federal Press Office official."

The newspaper also said that representatives of the Bonn Foreign Ministry attending the Geneva Conference revealed that their delegation leader had to endure Adenauer's stern condemnation over the phone because Brentano had failed to undermine the prestige of the German Democratic Republic at the beginning of the conference. According to these officials, the West German delegation's insistence on "not using" the German language at the meeting was also formulated by Adenauer and Brentano over the phone.

The newspaper said that some foreign journalists reminded people of the fact that the proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the peace treaty and the West Berlin issue was initially a "nightmare" for Adenauer. Adenauer "barely came around" to the idea, and because the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, was attending the meeting, he had to send Brentano to Geneva. However, he strictly instructed that no action should be taken without prior consultation.

    阿登纳在波恩远距离操纵命勃伦塔诺在日内瓦捣蛋
    新华社26日讯  “新德意志报”5月13日的报道揭露阿登纳严密控制西德出席日内瓦会议的代表团的情况。这家报纸援引法新社的报道说，据西德代表团透露，阿登纳曾经在电话里给勃伦塔诺下了个严厉的命令：无论如何不要进入国联大厦，以免与德意志民主共和国的代表会见。
    这家报纸说，勃伦塔诺在他的日内瓦别墅里经常用电话同阿登纳保持联系。这位西德总理远距离操纵着波恩代表团的事，早已是许多外国记者笔下的小品文题材了。一个英国记者这样嘲讽地说，“显然，勃伦塔诺不能独自给（西德）联邦新闻署发布官埃卡特发指示”。
    这家报纸还说，出席日内瓦会议的波恩外交部代表透露，他们的团长在电话里不得不忍受着阿登纳的厉声谴责，因为勃伦塔诺在会议的开始时没有能够破坏德意志民主共和国的威望。根据这些官员们的说法，西德代表团极力坚持的在会议上“不用”德语的主张，也是阿登纳同勃伦塔诺在电话中制订的。
    报纸说，某些外国记者就这件事提醒人们回忆，召开讨论和约及西柏林问题的外长会议的主张，对阿登纳来说，一开始就是一个“噩梦”。阿登纳“好容易才想通”，由于德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨出席会议，也只得派勃伦塔诺到日内瓦去。但是，他又严格地指令，事先没有请示不得采取行动。
