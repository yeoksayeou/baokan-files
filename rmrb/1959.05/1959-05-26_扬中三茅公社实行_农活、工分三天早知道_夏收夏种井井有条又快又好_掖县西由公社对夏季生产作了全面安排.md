    Yangzhong Sanmao Commune Implements "Know Farm Work and Work Points Three Days in Advance"
    Summer Harvesting and Planting are Orderly, Fast, and Good
    Yexian Xiyou Commune Makes Comprehensive Arrangements for Summer Production

    Our newspaper, Yangzhong, 24th dispatch: In the intense summer harvesting and planting campaign, Sanmao Commune in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, has widely adopted the practice of posting farm work schedules, "Knowing farm work and work points three days in advance," scientifically organizing and using labor, achieving timely summer harvesting, appropriate summer planting, and being busy without chaos.

    Currently, the summer harvesting and planting campaign in Sanmao Commune has reached a climax. At the start of the campaign, the entire commune had more than 8,400 mu of wheat ready for harvest; all land about to be sown needed deep plowing and sufficient base fertilizer; and over 1,800 mu of paddy fields needed timely transplanting. Under these circumstances, the Sanmao Commune Party Committee demanded that the harvested grain must be resolutely secured to ensure a bumper harvest and every grain returned to the granary; summer-sown crops must seize the opportunity to strive for a great harvest throughout the year. To achieve this requirement, the entire commune organized 95% of its labor force to participate in the summer harvesting and planting campaign. Because a large amount of labor was invested in the front line, and various farm works were complicated, how the production team cadres could reasonably organize and use this labor became a major problem. When Su Kaiwen, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, was inspecting work in the Chuidong Management Area, he found that the cadres at all levels in this management area were busy and chaotic in leading the summer harvest and planting, the division and use of labor were disorganized, and the members were clueless about the farm work they had to do, so the progress of the summer harvest and planting was slow. At the same time, it was found that each production team of the Jianning Management Area widely adopted the practice of posting farm work schedules, "Knowing farm work and work points three days in advance," with good results, the arrangements for various farm works and the use of labor were well organized, the progress of summer harvesting and planting was fast, and the quality was good. Therefore, the Commune Party Committee timely summarized and promoted this experience.

    The specific practice of posting farm work schedules, "Knowing farm work and work points three days in advance" is: the production team, according to the busy plan of summer harvesting and planting, after specific consultation and research with the members, based on the specific conditions at the time and place, and the urgency, difficulty of operation, strength of labor, and technical level of various farm works, arrange a three-day farm work plan, determine what kind of work will be done by whom in these three days, how much quota should be completed, what requirements should be met, when it should be completed, and how many work points should be rewarded, and write these items in detail on the sign, give it to the members for discussion and execution, so that each member knows the work to be done in the next three days the day before. Each three-day farm work plan has a focus, and each day's farm work also has a daily focus. In order to prevent the plan from being disrupted by rainy days, some production teams have also formulated two sets of plans for sunny and rainy days. The commune, management area, and production team have also established farm work acceptance organizations and acceptance systems at all levels to ensure the quality of farm work.

    After the implementation of the practice of posting farm work schedules, "Knowing farm work and work points three days in advance," the planning of the work of the production team cadres was greatly strengthened, and the production team cadres learned to use "troops" and improved their command ability. All kinds of farm work can be carried out in an orderly manner, and the division and use of labor are very organized, achieving great busyness without chaos. At the same time, work evaluation and point calculation are much more convenient than in the past.

    Since the members know the farm work and work points in advance, the initiative and enthusiasm of the members have been greatly mobilized. Each member takes the initiative to actively complete the daily prescribed labor quota, doing things on the same day. After the production teams in the Jianning Management Area implemented the posting of farm work schedules, the work efficiency generally increased by one time. The more than 470 mu of wheat in the entire management area was originally planned to be harvested in five days. As a result of the proper use of labor, it was harvested in three days. Before a production team in the Chuidong Management Area implemented the posting of farm work schedules, seventeen laborers harvested five mu of wheat in two days. After implementing the posting of farm work schedules, they harvested more than ten mu in one day. When the Samsung Production Team in the Xinghua Management Area was rushing to harvest wheat, the captain got up early to prepare to call the members to work, but some members had already gone to the fields with sickles to harvest wheat.

    The adoption of the practice of posting farm work schedules, "Knowing farm work and work points three days in advance," has greatly accelerated the progress of summer harvesting and planting, achieving simultaneous harvesting, collecting, plowing, and planting. From the 16th to the 21st, in five days, the entire commune basically harvested more than 8,400 mu of wheat, deeply plowed more than 6,000 mu of land, harvested more than 4,000 mu of green manure, applied base fertilizer to more than 4,500 mu, and transplanted more than 1,000 mu of rice, all of which were of good quality.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Yexian, Dispatch: While strengthening the late-stage management of wheat, Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, through calculating time, assigning tasks, and calculating labor, is vigorously grasping the preparatory work for summer harvesting and planting.

    The area of wheat fields in this commune has expanded by more than 7,000 mu compared with last year, and wheat fields account for more than 80% of the cultivated land area. Wheat growth is better than in previous years, with thick stalks, tall plants, and high density. Therefore, this year's summer harvest is also more labor-intensive. In order to harvest and plant in a timely manner, the commune rationally arranged labor by calculating tasks. The commune's 52,000 mu of wheat requires 2.5 working days per mu for harvesting and transportation alone, totaling 130,000 working days. The commune currently has 10,700 laborers who are fully committed to summer harvesting, but it still lacks more than 23,000 working days. The solutions are: (1) During the summer harvest, factories will stop work for ten days, and cadres from organs and enterprises, middle school students, and teachers will be mobilized to participate in wheat harvesting. This will increase the labor force by more than 840; (2) The commune has 44 rubber-wheeled carts for transportation. It will transport urgently needed materials in advance or use the commune's cars. Once the wheat harvest arrives, it will stop other transportation to support the wheat harvest; (3) Rush to manufacture 50 ground-row cars, each of which is more than twice as efficient as a small cart; (4) Use sickles to harvest, changing the past habit of pulling wheat. Through the above methods, the problem of insufficient labor can be basically solved. In addition, change large threshing grounds to small ones, and thresh in units of groups, which is convenient for management and timely for threshing, drying, and warehousing. The work on the threshing ground is assigned to women and the elderly, and the full male labor force is used for harvesting and transportation.

    In order to ensure the timely sowing and quality of summer-sown crops, before the start of the summer harvest, the commune took the following measures to vigorously accumulate fertilizer: (1) The commune has a Party Committee Secretary who leads the fertilizer accumulation leading group composed of relevant department heads; each production team has a captain who specifically leads fertilizer accumulation; and each production team has a professional fertilizer accumulation team of five to ten people; (2) Combine member fertilizer accumulation with collective fertilizer accumulation. On the basis of self-reporting and public discussion, implement a five-fixed responsibility system for member fertilizer accumulation, including fixed quality, fixed quantity, and fixed remuneration; (3) Vigorously develop pig raising to accumulate fertilizer. The commune's publicly owned piglets have been distributed to households for raising more than 3,200; (4) Take measures such as digging pits, scraping house soil, digging alkaline soil, bay mud, and making shell powder to open up new fertilizer sources. After taking the above measures, the entire commune has accumulated more than 100 million jin of fertilizer.

    扬中三茅公社实行“农活、工分三天早知道”
    夏收夏种井井有条又快又好
    掖县西由公社对夏季生产作了全面安排
    本报扬中24日电  江苏扬中县三茅公社在紧张的夏收夏种运动中，普遍采用农活挂牌，“农活、工分三天早知道”的做法，科学地组织和使用劳力，做到及时夏收，适时夏种，忙而不乱。
    目前，三茅公社的夏收夏种运动已形成高潮。运动开始时，全公社有八千四百多亩元麦等待收割；所有即将播种的土地都要进行深耕，下足基肥；一千八百多亩水稻田要及时插秧。在这种情况下，中共三茅公社党委要求，夏收的粮食必须坚决拿到手，保证做到丰产丰收，颗粒归仓；夏播作物一定要抓住头，力争全年大丰收。为了达到这个要求，全公社组织了95％的劳力投入了夏收夏种运动。由于投入第一线的劳力较多，而各种农活又比较繁杂，因此，生产队的干部如何合理地组织和使用这些劳力，就成了一个很大的问题。公社党委第一书记苏开文在圌东管理区检查工作的时候，发现这个管理区的各级干部在领导夏收夏种中，又忙又乱，劳动力的分工和使用都比较紊乱，社员对自己要做的农活心中无数，夏收夏种的进度比较迟缓。在这同时，又发现建宁管理区各生产队普遍采用农活挂牌，“农活、工分三天早知道”的做法，效果很好，各种农活的安排和劳动力的使用井井有条，夏收夏种的进度快，质量好。因此，公社党委及时总结和推广了这条经验。
    农活挂牌，“农活、工分三天早知道”的具体做法是：生产同按照夏收夏种的大忙计划，经过同社员具体商量研究，根据当时当地的具体情况，分别各种农活的轻重缓急、操作难易、劳力强弱和技术高低等，排出三天的农活计划，确定这三天内什么人干什么活，要完成多少定额，达到什么要求，什么时候完成，有多少工分报酬，并把这些项目详细写在牌子上，交给社员讨论执行，使每个社员在前一天就知道后三天要做的活。每三天的农活计划都有一个重点，每天的农活还有每天的重点。为了不使计划被雨天打乱，有的生产队还订出了晴天和雨天的两套计划。公社、管理区、生产队还层层建立了农活验收组织和验收制度，保证了农活的质量。
    实行农活挂牌，“农活、工分三天早知道”的做法以后，大大加强了生产队干部的工作计划性，并使生产队的干部学会了用“兵”，提高了指挥能力，各项农活都能有秩序地进行，劳动力的分工和使用都很有条有理，做到大忙不乱。同时，评工计分也比过去方便得多。
    由于社员们都做到农活、工分事先心中有数，大大调动了社员的主动性和积极性，每个社员都主动地按照每天规定的劳动定额，积极地去完成，做到当天事情当天了。建宁管理区各生产队在实行农活挂牌以后，普遍提高工效一倍，全管理区四百七十多亩元麦，原计划五天割完，由于劳力使用得当，结果三天割完。圌东管理区一个生产队在未实行农活挂牌以前，十七个劳力两天割麦五亩，实行农活挂牌以后，一天就割十多亩。兴华管理区三星生产队在抢收元麦时，队长起大早准备喊社员上工，有些社员却早拿着镰刀上田割麦去了。
    采用农活挂牌，“农活、工分三天早知道”的做法，大大加快了夏收夏种的进度，做到边割、边收、边耕、边种。全公社从16日到21日五天内，八千四百多亩元麦，已基本割完，深耕土地六千多亩，收割绿肥四千多亩，下基肥四千五百多亩，插秧一千多亩，质量都很好。
    本报讯  山东掖县西由人民公社，在加强小麦后期管理的同时，通过算时间，摆任务，算劳力，大抓夏收夏种准备工作。
    这个社的麦田面积比去年扩大了七千多亩，麦田占耕地面积80％以上。小麦生长比往年好，秸秆粗、植株高、密度大。因此，今年的夏收费工也多。为了及时收割和夏种，公社通过算任务合理地安排了劳力。全社五万二千亩小麦，光收割搬运每亩需要二点五个劳动日，共需十三万个劳动日。全社现有一万零七百个劳力全力以赴投入夏收以外，还缺二万三千多个劳动日，解决的办法是：（1）在夏收期间工厂停工十天，动员机关、企业干部、中学学生、教员等参加麦收。这样就增加了八百四十多个劳力；（2）公社有四十四辆搞运输的胶轮大车，事先把急需运的物资提前运或用社的汽车运，麦收一到就停止其他运输支援麦收；（3）突击制造五十辆地排车，每辆比小推车提高工效一倍多；（4）采用镰刀割，改变过去拔麦的习惯。通过上述办法，劳力不足的问题基本上能得到解决。另外，改大场园为小场园，以小组为单位打场，这样管理方便，打、晒、入仓及时。场园上的活分配给妇女和老年人干，男整劳力进行收割和搬运。
  为了使夏播作物播种及时和保证质量，这个公社在夏收开始之前采取了以下措施大抓积肥：（1）公社有一名党委书记为主吸收有关部门的负责人组成积肥领导小组；各生产队都有一名队长具体领导积肥；每个生产队都有五到十人的专业积肥队伍。（2）社员积肥和集体积肥相结合。对社员积肥在自报公议的基础上，实行定质、定量、定报酬等五定责任制。（3）大搞养猪积肥，这个公社的公有小猪已分到户喂养的有三千二百多头。（4）采取打坑、刮屋土、挖碱土、湾泥、造贝壳粉等开辟新肥源。采取上述办法以后，全公社已积肥一亿多斤。
