According to a report in the Heilongjiang Daily, the Mudanjiang Textile Factory launched a mass movement throughout the factory in January of this year, centered on opposing irresponsibility, opposing waste, and establishing and improving various management responsibility systems. By adopting the methods of extensive airing of views, big debates, big-character posters, and the three-way combination of cadres, technical personnel, and workers, the factory conducted a comprehensive inspection and rectification of the existing rules and regulations, thus rapidly reversing some of the chaotic phenomena in production management in the past. A new atmosphere has emerged where everyone manages affairs and every task has someone responsible, enabling the factory to complete the total output value in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 3.3 times compared with the same period last year. The first-class product rate reached 100%, and labor productivity also increased by 64.93% compared with the same period last year.

During the mass production movement last year, the factory successively eliminated 2,040 rules and regulations that restricted mass enthusiasm, hindered the development of productive forces, and were unfavorable to the internal unity of employees, and established more than 560 new management systems, greatly simplifying business procedures, improving work efficiency, freeing leaders from tedious affairs, strengthening the relationship between leaders and the masses, strengthening leadership over production, and creating conditions for workers to participate in management and streamlining organizations. However, some issues that cannot be ignored have also been exposed in actual work, mainly: 1. The close combination of vigorous mass movements and strengthening enterprise management was insufficient. 2. The close combination of abolishing and establishing rules and regulations was insufficient. For example, when abolishing certain original systems, the necessary new systems were not established correspondingly, or the new systems were not effectively implemented after they were established, and some that should not have been abolished were abolished, and some systems disappeared without being announced as abolished. 3. The close combination of professional management and mass management was insufficient. 4. The close combination of centralized and unified leadership and decentralized management was insufficient, thus causing some abnormal phenomena in production and management.

Starting in January of this year, the factory's Party committee organized all employees to extensively air their views, focusing on "three destructions and three establishments" (i.e., destroying the one-sided view of only wanting democracy and not wanting centralization, establishing the comprehensive view of both fully relying on the masses and concentrating leadership; destroying all unreasonable rules and regulations in production, establishing necessary and reasonable new management systems; destroying various phenomena of irresponsibility and waste, establishing a responsibility system where everything is managed by someone and a concept of economic accounting). Within two weeks, employees across the factory exposed more than 8,000 opinions on loopholes in management systems and waste. The Party committee promptly adopted the "three-way combination" method to comprehensively conduct detailed review and research on these opinions, with leaders mobilizing the masses to investigate, rectify, and establish simultaneously, deeply examining shortcomings and improving management work. New management systems for the factory, workshops, and groups were established separately. Within half a month, 64 management systems at the workshop level were established. Workers in a single fine spinning group established 14 group management systems on their own, achieving "everyone manages affairs, every task has someone responsible" within the group. In particular, because these systems were proposed and formulated by the masses themselves based on the actual needs of production, the provisions were simple and clear, easy to implement, and the effect was immediate. For example, the original second-class product management system in the third workshop was complex, with a total of 18 articles, which employees could not remember clearly. This time, after mass discussion and revision, it was reduced to four articles, and when implemented, the number of second-class products decreased by 60% in less than a month.

Based on the principles of being conducive to production development, conducive to enterprise management, and conducive to the display of mass enthusiasm, and without hindering centralized and unified command, three-level management was implemented in production, technology, and cost management. In addition to the 17 kinds of powers such as production scheduling between workshops, product specifications, quality standards, and quality inspection systems that are still centrally controlled by the factory, 30 other kinds of powers such as equipment utilization were delegated to the workshops; and 8 kinds of powers such as short-term leave (within a week), attendance, production scheduling between processes, and operating methods were delegated to the groups. In order to further strengthen the Party's leadership and give full play to the role of organizations such as the administration, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, while implementing the above-mentioned leadership principles and changing leadership methods, they have stopped the pilot implementation of the workshop management committee method. In this way, the entire factory has formed a new situation of centralized power, decentralized power, coordinated上下, and a unified game across the factory.

Since strengthening planning management, the phenomenon of arbitrary shutdowns and disconnections in production that often occurred in the past has been basically eliminated, greatly improving labor productivity. The first quarter's leap forward plan was increased from the original 1,976 tons to 2,126 tons. The fine spinning machine maintenance score was improved from often having half of them being second-class products to all first-class products. The twisting section used to have four "mores", namely more empty spindles, more broken yarns, more bobbins falling to the ground, and more yarn ends falling to the ground. Now this phenomenon has been basically eliminated. The ability of workers to watch the machines has also increased, and labor productivity has been significantly improved, increasing by 64.93% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year. In this way, while increasing production without increasing manpower, not only was the leap forward plan realized, but also 106 workers were transferred to support steel and sideline production.

### 事事有人管理　件件有人负责  牡丹江纺织厂健全规章制度正品率达到百分之百

    事事有人管理　件件有人负责
    牡丹江纺织厂健全规章制度正品率达到百分之百
    据黑龙江日报消息　牡丹江纺织厂自今年1月在全厂掀起了以反对无人负责、反对浪费、建立与健全各种管理上的责任制度为中心的群众运动，采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报和干部、技术人员、工人三结合的办法，对现行的规章制度进行了一次全面的大检查和大整顿，因而迅速地扭转了过去在生产管理上某些混乱现象。出现了事事有人管理，件件有人负责的新气象，使今年第一季度完成的生产总值比去年同期增长了三点三倍，产品质量正品率达到百分之百，劳动生产率也比去年同期提高了64.93％。
    这个厂在去年的群众生产运动中，先后破除了两千零四十条限制群众积极性，阻碍生产力发展及不利于职工内部团结的规章制度，建立了五百六十余条新的管理制度，大大简化了业务手续，提高了工作效率，使领导从繁琐的事务中摆脱出来，密切了领导和群众的关系，加强了对生产的领导，同时也为工人参加管理，精简机构创造了条件。但在实际工作中也暴露出一些不容忽视的问题，主要是：一、大搞群众运动与加强企业管理密切结合不够；二、规章制度的破与立密切结合不够，如在破除原有某些制度时，没有相应地建立起必要的新制度，或在新制度建立后未切实执行，有些不应该破除的也被破除了，有些制度并未宣布破除就自消自灭了；三、专业管理与群众管理密切结合不够；四、集中统一领导与分级管理密切结合不够，因而造成了生产和管理上的某些不正常现象。
    从今年1月份开始，这个厂的党委就组织全厂职工，以“三破三立”（即破只要民主不要集中的片面观点，立既要充分依靠群众又要集中领导的全面观点；破生产上一切不合理的规章制度，立必要的合理的新的管理制度；破各种无人负责和浪费现象，立事事有人管的责任制度和经济核算观念）为内容大鸣大放。全厂职工在两周内，共揭发出管理制度上的漏洞、浪费等方面的意见达八千余条。党委及时采取“三结合”的方法，对这些意见全面地进行了细致的审查研究，有领导的发动群众边查、边改、边建，深入检查缺点，改进管理工作。并分别建立了厂、车间和小组的新的管理制度。在半个月内共建立起车间一级的管理制度六十四条，仅细纱一个小组工人自己动手就建立了十四条小组管理制度。做到了小组内“事事有人管理，件件有人负责”。特别是因为这些制度都是根据生产实际的需要，由群众自己提出自己制订的，条文简单明确，便于贯彻，效果立竿见影。如三车间原有的二级品管理制度，内容复杂，共有十八条，职工记不清楚。这次经过群众讨论修订为四条，执行起来，在不到一个月的时间内，二级品减少了60％。
    根据有利于生产发展、有利于企业管理、有利于群众积极性的发挥，而不妨碍集中统一指挥的原则下，在生产、技术和成本管理方面实行了三级管理，除各车间之间的生产调度，产品规格、质量标准、质量检查制度等十七种职权仍由厂部集中掌握外，其他如设备利用等三十种职权下放到车间；短期请假
  （一周内）、考勤、工序之间生产调度、操作方法等八种职权下放到小组。为了进一步加强党的领导，充分发挥行政、工会、共青团等组织作用，他们在贯彻上述领导原则和改变领导方法的同时，已停止试行车间管委会的办法，这样，全厂就形成了有集中，有分权，上下协调，全厂一盘棋的新局面。
    自从加强计划管理之后，基本上消除了过去经常发生任意停车和生产脱节的现象，大大提高了劳动生产率。使第一季跃进计划由原订一千九百七十六吨，提高到二千一百二十六吨。细纱机器保养评分，由过去经常有一半是二等品，提高为全部一等品。捻线工段过去存在四多，即空锭多、坏纱多、木管掉地多、纱头掉地多，现在这种现象已经基本消除。工人看台能力也有所增加，劳动生产率有了显著的提高，今年第一季度比去年同期提高64.93％。这样，在增产不增人的情况下，不但实现了跃进计划，而且还抽出了一百零六名工人支援钢铁和副业生产。
