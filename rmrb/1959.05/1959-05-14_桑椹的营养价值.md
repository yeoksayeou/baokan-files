    The nutritional value of mulberries
    Early summer has arrived, and mulberries are about to ripen. In the past, people only picked them for children to eat and did not make good use of them. In fact, mulberries have many uses.
    Mulberry juice, fermented into wine after pressing, has a bright red color and a sweet taste. The mulberry residues from pressing can be used for seedling cultivation to grow new mulberry trees.
    Mulberries are excellent bait for feeding fish. They are suitable for both fish fry and adult fish. Fish that eat mulberries grow quickly and have delicious, rich meat.
    Mulberries contain a large amount of sugar, protein, and mineral salts, as well as very rich Vitamin A and Vitamin C. In addition, mulberries also contain a lot of calcium, so the nutritional value of mulberries is very high. They are a cheap and good-quality substitute for fruit. Because mulberries have no peel and the surface is uneven, it may be covered with dust and bacteria. Therefore, it is best to wash them with cold boiled water with salt or disinfect them with potassium permanganate solution before eating.
    Currently, mulberries have turned red, and will soon turn from red to purple-black, at which point they can be picked and utilized. When picking, be careful to put them in clean baskets or buckets in a timely manner, and do not compress them too tightly. It is best to send them to the local purchasing station or processing plant on the same day. During transportation, use straw mats to cover them to prevent sun exposure, because mulberries cannot be used after they become hot, fermented, or moldy.
    China has vast mulberry gardens throughout the north and south, and it is estimated that tens of millions of dan of mulberries can be utilized. Fully utilizing mulberries is of great significance for increasing the income of commune members and accumulating wealth for the country.

    桑椹的营养价值
    初夏已到，桑椹就要成熟了，过去人们除了摘下给小孩吃吃以外，并没有好好利用它。事实上桑椹的用处很大。
    桑椹经过压榨，流出的果汁发酵酿成的酒，颜色红艳，味道香甜。压榨时取出的桑子，可以育苗，培育新的桑树。
    桑椹喂鱼，是上好的饵料。对鱼苗或成鱼都很相宜。食桑果的鱼群，生长迅速、肉质肥美。
    桑椹含有多量糖分，蛋白质及矿物盐，还含有非常丰富的甲种维生素和丙种维生素。此外，桑椹里钙质含量也很多，因此，桑果的营养价值很高。是一种价廉物美的水果代用品，桑果因无果皮，果面又凸凹不平，表面可能粘有灰尘和细菌，因此，吃的时候最好用加盐的冷开水来洗净，或用高锰酸钾水溶液消毒后再吃。
    目前桑果已经发红，转眼由红变成紫黑色，就可以采摘利用了。采摘时，要注意及时放入干净的箩或桶内，不能压得太紧。最好当天就送到当地的收购站或加工厂去。在运输过程中，要用草席遮盖、防止曝晒，因为桑果发热、发酵、发霉后都不能再利用。
    我国大江南北，桑园广大，估计可以利用的桑果数以千万担计。充分利用桑果，对增加公社社员收入和为国家积累财富都有很大的意义。
