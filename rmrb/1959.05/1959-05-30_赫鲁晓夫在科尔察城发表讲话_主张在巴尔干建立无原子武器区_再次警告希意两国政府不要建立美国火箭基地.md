Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 28th. Accompanied by Hoxha, Shehu, Kabo and others, the Soviet Party and government delegation led by Khrushchev visited Korçë, the political and cultural center of southern Albania, today.

Khrushchev delivered a speech at a mass rally in Korçë. He expressed his sincere gratitude to the Albanian working people for their warm hospitality to the Soviet Party and government delegation, and spoke about the great achievements made by the Albanian people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Labor Party. Subsequently, he discussed several issues related to the international situation.

Khrushchev said that he once again warned the Greek and Italian governments not to allow the United States to establish rocket bases on their territory.

Khrushchev said that it is necessary to correctly estimate the strength and power of the socialist camp and not to play with fire. We propose another path—the path of eliminating the "Cold War" and easing international tensions. The people of all countries hope that countries will reach agreements on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons tests, and the reduction of armed forces. The people of all countries also hope that there will be no atomic weapons and rocket weapons in the Balkan Peninsula, in Italy, or in other regions. We have made suggestions on these issues and will ensure that these issues are resolved. I think these suggestions are sympathetic to the Greek people and the Italian people. At the same time, I believe that our suggestions are supported by the people of Yugoslavia and other countries. Not to mention our friends and allies, Bulgaria and Romania.

Khrushchev pointed out that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean region is a major step in strengthening the cause of peace in Europe and the world.

Khrushchev continued, "Today I read a speech by Mr. Brentano, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany. He said: The Soviet Union does not give up its proposals, so it is necessary to put pressure on it. He also said that if the Soviet Union does not give in, then there should be no summit meeting." Khrushchev asked, can Mr. Brentano decide these issues?

Khrushchev emphasized that we will fight unswervingly to consolidate peace. Whether Mr. Brentano likes our policy or not, we will steadfastly implement it. Our policy is based on safeguarding the interests of peace. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany is the most consistent with this goal. If Brentano and his government do not sign a peace treaty, then we will sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, and other countries willing to do so will also sign it, and one day in the future—even Mr. Brentano will sign it.

Khrushchev continued, "If you, representatives of Western countries, want to prolong the 'Cold War' state, if a summit meeting cannot be held recently, then we can wait until conditions are ripe."

Khrushchev announced that he might stay in Hungary on his way back from Albania.

    赫鲁晓夫在科尔察城发表讲话
    主张在巴尔干建立无原子武器区
    再次警告希意两国政府不要建立美国火箭基地
    新华社地拉那28日电　由赫鲁晓夫率领的苏联党政代表团，在霍查、谢胡和卡博等人陪同下，今天访问了阿尔巴尼亚南部的政治和文化中心科尔察城。
    赫鲁晓夫在科尔察的群众大会上发表演说。他对阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民对苏联党政代表团的殷勤款待表示衷心的感谢，并且谈到了阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就。随后，他谈到了有关国际局势的几个问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，再一次警告希腊和意大利政府，不要让美国在本国领土上建立火箭基地。
    赫鲁晓夫说，必须正确地估计社会主义阵营各国的实力和威力，不要玩火。我们建议走另一条道路——这就是消除“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势的道路。各国人民希望国与国之间就禁止核武器、立即停止核武器试验，裁减武装部队问题达成协议。各国人民还希望无论在巴尔干半岛，无论在意大利，无论在其他地区都没有原子武器和火箭武器。我们就这些问题提出了建议，并且将使这些问题获得解决。我想，这些建议得到希腊人民、意大利人民的同情。同时，我认为，我们这些建议是得到南斯拉夫和其他国家人民的支持的。更不用说我们的朋友和盟国，保加利亚和罗马尼亚了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在巴尔干半岛和地中海地区建立无原子武器的地区，是加强欧洲和全世界和平事业的一个重大的步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，我今天读了德意志联邦共和国外交部长勃伦塔诺先生的讲话。他说：苏联不放弃自己的建议，因此需要对它施加压力。他又说，如果苏联不让步，那末，就不应当举行政府首脑会议。赫鲁晓夫问道，难道勃伦塔诺先生能决定这些问题吗？
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，我们将毫不后退地为巩固和平而斗争。不管勃伦塔诺先生喜不喜欢我们的政策，我们还是要坚定不移地执行它。我们这种政策是从保障和平的利益出发的。缔结对德和约最符合这一目的。如果勃伦塔诺和他的政府不签订和约，那么我们就同德意志民主共和国签订和约，其他愿意这样作的国家也会签订的，而将来有一天——连勃伦塔诺先生也会签订的。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，如果你们，西方国家的代表先生们，还要拖延“冷战”状态，如果最近还不能举行政府首脑的会见，那么，我们可以等待到条件成熟的时候。
    赫鲁晓夫宣布，他在从阿尔巴尼亚回国途中，可能在匈牙利逗留。
