Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: Dong Biwu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, today extended warm congratulations and cordial greetings to the national revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel at the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel. He warmly praised their utmost loyalty to the Party, affirming that they will always be a highly valuable and active force in the cause of socialism and communism, and congratulated them on achieving even more outstanding results in the continued Great Leap Forward.

Comrade Dong Biwu's speech at the congress was filled with the Party and state's boundless concern for revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel. The over one thousand representatives attending the congress repeatedly and for extended periods warmly applauded his speech, thanking the Party and the state for their care, and expressing their determination to resolutely respond to the glorious call made to them by the Party and the state.

Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, then spoke at the meeting, extending warm congratulations to the congress on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. He said that in the Great Leap Forward of the motherland and in the vigorously developing people's commune movement, thousands upon thousands of demobilized, transferred, and retired soldiers, along with revolutionary martyrs' families and military families, together with the people of the whole country, have worked tirelessly, overcome all difficulties, and played a significant role in various production and work posts, becoming an important force in the cause of socialist construction. All comrades of the People's Liberation Army, as your comrades-in-arms and relatives, feel honored and proud of your noble qualities and heroic deeds.

After introducing the work of the People's Liberation Army's troop construction, Gan Siqi said to the congress that the comrades in the army are constantly thinking of you, and every achievement and contribution you make in socialist construction is a powerful encouragement to all officers and soldiers. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, we should strengthen contact, learn from each other, encourage each other, and together with the people of the whole country, continue to exert all our energy, strive for advancement, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind," and courageously advance along the broad road of socialism with full confidence.

Before the start of the congress, Comrade Dong Biwu also had cordial talks with some of the representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: The full text of the speech by Dong Biwu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, at the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel, is as follows:

This congress is a meeting of representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel after the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, I extend warm congratulations to the congress.

Revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel were activists in the great People's Liberation War and the democratic revolutionary struggle. They are also activists in the socialist revolutionary struggle and the socialist construction cause. Facts will continue to prove that they will always be a very valuable and active force in the cause of socialism and communism.

Since the Great Leap Forward, revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel have held high the banner of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. They have been active on all fronts of socialist construction and have made great contributions that are praised by everyone. In the tide of the Great Leap Forward, a large number of heroic and model figures have emerged, and you are their representatives. On behalf of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, I sincerely welcome you and extend warm congratulations and cordial greetings to the national revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel through you.

In the Great Leap Forward, you have all listened to the Party's words, going wherever the Party points. You have all immediately responded to every call of the Party and have been able to unite the masses and actively implement the Party's decisions together with them. You are utterly loyal to the Party.

In the Great Leap Forward, you have demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness, daring to overcome difficulties and conquering hardships, and diligently studying and practicing. Many of you are not only hard-working but also clever, making you both wise and brave, and indomitable shock troops in socialist construction.

In the Great Leap Forward, you have dared to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Many comrades have also been able to uphold the truth and actively struggle against various unhealthy phenomena in order to safeguard the cause of the Party and the interests of the people. You possess a noble communist style.

In the Great Leap Forward, many families of martyrs, though with gray hair, are full of energy. Many disabled soldiers, though physically impaired, have strong, passionate hearts and a revolutionary optimistic spirit. According to the state's regulations, these people should have been taken care of in their old age or allowed to rest, but they have tried everything possible to contribute to socialist construction. Their heroic image will always inspire people to move forward.

All these noble moral qualities are worthy of study by the people of the whole country. All these noble moral qualities are a concentrated expression of the moral qualities of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel.

Our socialist construction is developing at a high speed. However to completely build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture, there is still a long way to go, and to realize our desired communist society, the journey is even longer. We must not be satisfied with our existing achievements, and we must never become complacent. It is hoped that you will further enhance your communist ideological awareness, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, learn from the masses, and become one with the masses, be more modest and prudent, and advance forever.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the First Session of the Second National People's Congress called on the people of the whole country to strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. It is hoped that you will actively participate in the nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy that has already begun, raise the banner of the general line even higher on the basis of the 1958 Leap Forward, continue to leap forward, and make new and greater achievements in realizing this solemn goal.

It is particularly necessary to point out that the imperialists' policies of aggression and war are heading for bankruptcy, and the imperialist colonial system is heading for disintegration. However, socialist countries are like the rising sun, with all aspects of construction booming. The national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are burning like raging fires. However, the imperialists and reactionaries are not reconciled to their defeat. They are using all means to engage in subversion and create rebellions. The recent rebellion of the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet is an example. Our domestic class struggle has not completely ended, and Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu have not yet been liberated. We must be even more vigilant. Comrades of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel, you have already proven to be loyal soldiers in defending the motherland and defending the Party's cause in the anti-rightist struggle, in the struggle to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and in the struggle to defend the border and coastal defenses. It is hoped that you will continue to carry forward this tradition and make greater efforts in maintaining the cause of the Party, defending socialist construction, and defending world peace.

Comrades! Your past achievements are inseparable from the education and training you have received from the Party and the government, as well as the support of the broad masses. In the future, the Party and the government will provide you with greater support through preferential treatment and demobilization work, organizing and mobilizing the masses to help you make greater achievements. Many places have already made great achievements in preferential treatment and demobilization work. The comrades from the more than seventy model units of preferential treatment and demobilization work who are attending the meeting are their representatives. On behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, I warmly welcome them and warmly congratulate them on making greater achievements in preferential treatment and demobilization work.

Preferential treatment and demobilization work is a long-term political task for the entire Party and the entire people. Preferential treatment and demobilization work is an important part of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Because our army is the people's army. They have made the greatest efforts for the great victory of the revolutionary war. One of the important factors that our army has been able to become an invincible and ever-victorious army is that our Party has always paid attention to mobilizing the masses to do a good job in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. The work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen supported the victory of the People's Liberation War and the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and will continue to support our People's Liberation Army in achieving the great victory of defending socialist construction, liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and defending world peace.

Since the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the communization of the people, the lives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel have been better guaranteed, and their production and work have also been better arranged. However, the lives of some of them are still difficult, and whether in life, production, or work, they still need the necessary preferential treatment and care from the Party and the government and the broad masses, which cannot be ignored.

Preferential treatment and demobilization work is not only about helping a few people solve their living difficulties, but also a political work that inspires morale and educates the masses. Helping revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel solve their living and production difficulties has a great effect on inspiring morale. More forms should also be adopted to strengthen mass activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, so as to inspire morale. Since revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel are an active force to be relied on, they should be educated and encouraged through various forms, and they should be used well, so that they can better play an active role and better serve as revolutionaries and promoters of socialist construction. Our revolutionary martyrs exchanged their blood for the victory of the revolution and opened up a path for us to carry out socialist construction. We should further commend their merits and use their revolutionary spirit to educate our future generations, so that our children and grandchildren cherish and defend the fruits of revolution and construction, learn from their example, exert all their energy, strive for advancement, and build our country into a great socialist country with a modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and continue to move towards communism.

Finally, I wish all revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel to make even more outstanding achievements. I wish the Party committees and administrations in all regions and units to make even more outstanding achievements in preferential treatment and demobilization work.

I wish you all good health. (Attached picture)

    董必武副主席勉励烈军属和残废复员退伍转业军人
    赤胆忠心　团结群众　永远前进
    甘泗淇代表解放军全体官兵向战友和亲人致以热烈的祝贺
    据新华社19日讯　中共中央政治局委员、中华人民共和国副主席董必武，今天在全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上代表党中央和毛主席，向全国的烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人致以热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问，热烈赞扬他们对党赤胆忠心，永远是社会主义和共产主义事业中非常珍贵的一批积极力量，祝贺他们在继续大跃进中做出更加优异的成绩。
    董必武同志在大会上的讲话，充满了党和国家对烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人的无限关怀。参加大会的一千多位代表，在他讲话中不断地长时间热烈鼓掌，感谢党和国家对他们的关怀，表示坚决响应党和国家向他们提出的光荣号召。
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇接着在会上讲话，代表人民解放军全体官兵向大会致以热烈的祝贺。他说，在祖国一日千里的大跃进中，在蓬勃发展的人民公社运动中，千千万万的复员、转业、退伍军人和烈属、军属同全国人民一起，不辞艰辛，排除万难，在各个生产和工作岗位上，发挥了很大的作用，成了社会主义建设事业中的一支重要力量。作为你们的战友和亲人的人民解放军全体同志，都为你们的这种高贵品质和英雄事迹，感到光荣和自豪。
    甘泗淇向大会介绍了人民解放军的部队建设工作以后说，军队的同志无时无刻不在想念着你们，你们在社会主义建设中的每一个成就、每一分贡献，对全军官兵都是一个有力的鼓舞。在社会主义建设大跃进的高潮中，我们应该加强联系，互相学习，互相鼓舞，和全国人民一起，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，戒骄戒躁，牢牢记住毛主席
  “虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，信心百倍地沿着社会主义的康庄大道奋勇前进。
    董必武同志在大会开始前，还和部分代表作了亲切的谈话。
    新华社19日讯　中共中央政治局委员、中华人民共和国副主席董必武在全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上的讲话。全文如下：
    这次大会，是在我国社会主义建设大跃进以后，烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人代表的一次会师大会，我代表中国共产党中央委员会和毛主席，向大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人在伟大的人民解放战争中和民主革命斗争中是积极分子。在社会主义革命斗争中和社会主义建设事业中又是积极分子。事实还将继续证明，他们永远是社会主义和共产主义事业中非常珍贵的一批积极力量。
    大跃进以来，烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人高高地举起了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的大旗，活跃在社会主义建设事业的各个战线上，做出了人人称赞的巨大贡献。在大跃进的浪潮中，涌现了大批的英雄模范人物，你们就是他们的代表，我代表中国共产党和毛主席衷心地欢迎你们，并且通过你们向全国的烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人致以热烈的祝贺和亲切的慰问。
    在大跃进中，你们都能听党的话，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里。党的每一号召，你们都能立即响应，并且能够团结群众，同群众在一起积极执行。你们对党赤胆忠心。
    在大跃进中，你们表现了大无畏的精神，勇于克服困难，战胜困难，又能苦钻苦练。你们中间有许多同志，既能苦干，又能巧干，是智勇双全、无坚不摧的社会主义建设突击手。
    在大跃进中，你们敢想、敢说、敢干，许多同志又能坚持真理，为了维护党的事业和人民群众的利益，而勇于向各种不良现象进行积极的斗争。你们具有高尚的共产主义风格。
    在大跃进中，有许多烈士家属，虽然白发苍苍，但他们的干劲却十分饱满，有许多残废军人，虽然肢体残废了，但他们却具有一颗刚强火热的心和革命的乐观主义精神。按照国家的规定，本来这些人是应当养老或者休养的，但他们却想尽一切可能的办法为社会主义建设贡献一分力量。他们的英雄形象，将永远鼓舞人们前进。
    所有这些高尚的道德品质，值得全国人民学习。所有这些高尚的道德品质，是全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人道德品质的集中表现。
    我们的社会主义建设在高速度地发展着。然而要把我国完全建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，还有不短的一段路程，而要实现我们所向往的共产主义社会，则还有更长的路程。我们决不能满足已有的成绩，决不能骄傲自满起来。希望你们进一步提高自己的共产主义思想觉悟，虚心听取群众的意见，向群众学习，和群众打成一片，更加谦虚谨慎，永远前进。
    党的八届六中全会和第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议号召全国人民为完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划而奋斗。希望你们积极投入到已经开始的全民性的增产节约运动中去，在1958年跃进的基础上，更高地举起总路线的大旗，继续跃进，为实现这个庄严的奋斗目标，做出新的更大的成绩。
    特别需要指出的是，帝国主义的侵略政策，战争政策，正在走向破产，帝国主义的殖民体系，正在走向瓦解。而社会主义各国却像旭日初升，各项建设蒸蒸日上，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，正像熊熊的烈火燃烧着。但是，帝国主义和反动派是不甘心自己的失败的。他们用尽种种手段搞颠覆活动，制造叛乱。最近西藏上层反动集团的叛乱就是一个例子。我们国内的阶级斗争还没有完全结束，台、澎、金、马还没有解放，我们必须更高地提起警惕。烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人同志们，在反右派斗争中，在争取解放台、澎、金、马的斗争中，在保卫边防海防的斗争中，已经证明是保卫祖国，捍卫党的事业的忠诚战士，希望继续发扬这种传统，在维护党的事业，保卫社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的斗争中，作出更大的努力。
    同志们！你们过去的成绩，是同党和政府对你们的教养以及广大群众的支持分不开的，今后党和政府将通过优抚、复员工作，组织和发动群众给你们以更大的支持，帮助你们作出更大的成绩。许多地方在优抚、复员工作上已经做出了很大的成绩。到会的七十多个优抚、复员工作模范单位的同志就是他们的代表。我代表党中央和毛主席热烈地欢迎他们，热烈地祝贺他们在优抚、复员工作中取得更大成绩。
    优抚、复员工作是全党全民的一项相当长期的政治任务。优抚、复员工作是拥军优属的一个重要部分。因为我们的军队是人民的军队。革命战争的伟大胜利，他们付出了最大的努力。我们的军队所以能够成为攻无不克、战无不胜的常胜军，我们党一向注意发动群众做好拥军优属工作也是一个重要的因素。拥军优属工作支持了人民解放战争的胜利，支持了抗美援朝战争的胜利，还将继续支持我们解放军取得保卫社会主义建设，解放台、澎、金、马，保卫世界和平的伟大胜利。
    自从工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化以来，烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人的生活得到了更好的保障，他们的生产和工作也更好安排了。但是，他们当中一部分人的生活，现在仍有困难，不论在生活上，还是在生产或工作上，仍然需要党和政府以及广大群众给以必要的优待和照顾，这是不能忽视的。
    优抚、复员工作，不仅是帮助少数人解决生活困难的工作，它是一项鼓舞士气、教育群众的政治工作。帮助烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人解决生活生产困难问题，对鼓舞士气有很大的作用，还应当采取更多的形式加强群众的拥军优属活动，鼓舞士气。烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人既然是一批应当依靠的积极力量，就应当通过多种多样的形式进行教育和鼓动，并且很好地使用他们，使他们更好地发挥积极作用，更好地做社会主义建设的革命派和促进派。我们的先烈用他们的血换来了革命的胜利，为我们开辟了进行社会主义建设的道路，我们应当进一步褒扬他们的功绩，用他们的革命精神教育我们的后代子孙，使我们的子孙珍爱和保卫革命和建设的果实，学习他们的榜样，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，并且继续向共产主义迈进。
    最后，预祝全体烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人做出更优异的成绩。预祝各地各单位的党委和行政在优抚、复员工作上做出更优异的成绩。
    祝同志们身体健康。（附图片）
