Xinhua News Agency, May 4th. Tonight, in Beijing, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, more than 20,000 young people gathered in Zhongshan Park to hold a garden party commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement.

    Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Ulanhu, Bo Yibo, Luo Ruiqing, Lin Feng, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, joined the youth in celebrating this beautiful festive night. Wherever Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping and others went, sustained applause and enthusiastic cheers erupted.

    Tonight, Zhongshan Park became the center of joy for the city's youth. Before night fell, groups of young workers, students, government officials, and People's Liberation Army soldiers happily walked through Tiananmen Square, where revolutionary predecessors fought for the independence and freedom of the motherland forty years ago, and poured into Zhongshan Park. The large horizontal banner hanging above the south gate of the Altar of Land and Grain, bearing the words "Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and Strive to Achieve the Continuing Leap Forward in 1959," gleamed under the lights. In this garden illuminated by thousands of colorful lights, songs and dances filled the air. Amidst waves of enthusiastic applause and cheers, many old soldiers and veteran revolutionaries who participated in the "May Fourth" Movement met with the youth. Tonight, these respected elders, together with the youth, seemed younger as they joined in the festivities. Zhu Wushan, one of the members of the earliest communist groups in Beijing, came among the students of Peking University to watch their artistic performances. During the intermission, this sixty-two-year-old comrade had a cordial conversation with many students, encouraging them to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement and dedicate the light and heat of their youth to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Among the singing and dancing crowds were representatives of national youth advanced producers and technical innovation experts. The newly built concert hall was filled with young red banner bearers, all of whom were vanguards from various production fronts in the capital, gathered together tonight to enjoy the wonderful performances of university students and professional song and dance troupes from the capital. The youth students of Beijing, with the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, were even more enthusiastic about dancing tonight. They performed songs and dances that they wrote and choreographed themselves. The "Song of College Students" written by Wang Shuyuan, a student at the Central Academy of Drama, powerfully sings out the college students' dedication to the industrial and agricultural labor front under the guidance of the Party, integrating with the worker-peasant masses, and contributing their youth and strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. The dance "The First Furnace of Steel," self-performed and choreographed by students from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, expresses the joyful mood of the entire school during steelmaking last year.

    While the youth of all ethnic groups rejoiced to their hearts' content at the garden party, three People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers who had returned from Tibet came into their dance circle, and applause and cheers immediately erupted. At the enthusiastic request of these young people, an officer of the People's Liberation Army who had participated in the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion recounted the situation of the Tibetan people assisting the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. At this time, many Tibetan youths danced Tibetan dances "Happy Young Men" and "Xikang Festival Dance," cheering the victory of the People's Liberation Army in quickly suppressing the Tibetan rebellion and cheering the new life of the Tibetan people. A Tibetan girl ran out of the crowd, took the hand of the People's Liberation Army officer, and inquired affectionately about the new life in Tibet. It turned out that they had met in Xigaze and reunited tonight like old friends.

    Apei A Wang Jinmei, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and representatives of visiting delegations from fraternal ethnic groups from all over the country also joined the youth of the capital in the festivities. Wherever they went, there was extra jubilation.

    Foreign guests from all over the world and foreign students in Beijing were invited to participate in the party. They formed close friendships with Chinese youth at the party, making this party even more joyful and lively. Guests from Africa sang folk songs from their countries and joined in the festivities with Chinese youth. Distinguished guests from the Algerian military delegation also enthusiastically joined in the singing and dancing with Chinese youth. Distinguished guests from the Colombian, Venezuelan, Chilean and Uruguayan trade union delegations told their Chinese youth friends that US imperialism is the common enemy of the Latin American people and the Chinese people, and we must unite to carry out a common struggle. They also shouted "Long live world peace!" in newly learned Chinese together with the Chinese youth.

    It was a beautiful night, the park was full of flowers, full of youthful vitality. Late at night, the garden was still full of songs and laughter. When colorful fireworks soared into the night sky, cheers erupted throughout the park. The colorful festive fireworks symbolized the bright and splendid future of Chinese youth. (Attached picture)

    新华社4日讯　“五四”运动策源地的北京，今晚有两万多青年欢聚在中山公园，举行了纪念“五四”四十周年的游园晚会。
    党和国家的领导人周恩来、朱德、邓小平、陈毅、李富春、乌兰夫、薄一波、罗瑞卿、林枫、李济深、黄炎培，以及共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦等，同青年们一起欢度了这个美好的节日之夜。周恩来和朱德、邓小平等同志，走到那里，那里就响起了经久不息的掌声和热烈的欢呼声。
    今晚，中山公园变成了全市青年欢乐的中心。夜色降临前，成群结队的青年工人、学生、机关干部和解放军官兵，欢欢乐乐地走过四十年前革命先辈为祖国的独立、自由而战的天安门广场，涌进中山公园。高悬在社稷坛南门上写着“发扬五四革命精神，为实现1959年的继续跃进而奋斗”大字的横标，在灯光照耀下闪出金光。在这万盏彩灯辉映的园林里，到处歌声洋溢，舞蹈翩翩。在一阵阵的热烈掌声和欢呼声中，许多当年参加“五四”运动的老战士和革命老前辈同青年们见了面。今晚，这些尊敬的老人和青年人一起联欢也显得年轻了。北京最早的共产主义小组的成员之一朱务善来到北京大学的学生中，观看学生们的文艺演出。当演出休息的时候，这位六十二岁的老同志，和许多学生亲切地交谈，他勉励青年们发扬“五四”革命精神，在祖国的社会主义建设事业中献出青春的光和热。
    在歌舞的人群中，有全国青年先进生产者和技术革新能手的代表。在新修建的音乐堂里坐满了青年红旗手，他们都是首都各个生产战线上的尖兵，今晚欢聚在一起观赏首都大学生和专业歌舞团的精彩表演。有着“五四”革命传统的北京青年学生们，今晚舞兴更浓。他们自演自己编的歌舞。中央戏剧学院学生王树元编的“大学生之歌”，有力地唱出大学生在党的教导下，到工农业劳动战线上，同工农群众相结合，为祖国社会主义建设事业贡献青春和力量。北京体育学院学生自演自编的舞蹈“第一炉钢”，表达出全校学生去年炼钢时的欢愉心情。
    各民族的青年在游园会上尽情地欢乐时，从西藏归来的三位人民解放军官兵来到了他们的舞圈，掌声、欢呼声顿时响成一片。在这些青年的热情要求下，曾经参加平息西藏叛乱的一位解放军军官讲述了藏族人民协助解放军平定叛乱的情况。这时，许多藏族青年又跳起藏族舞蹈“快乐的小伙子”、“西康节日舞”，欢呼人民解放军迅速平息西藏叛乱的胜利，欢呼西藏人民的新生。从人群中跑出一位藏族姑娘拉着解放军军官的手，亲切地询问西藏新生的情况。原来他们曾在日喀则见过面，今晚又像老友一样重逢了。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美和来自各地的兄弟民族参观团的代表也和首都青年一起联欢。他们走到那里，那里就格外欢腾。
    来自世界各国的外宾和在京的外国留学生应邀参加了晚会。他们在晚会上同中国青年结下了亲密的友谊，使这个晚会更加欢乐和热闹。非洲的客人们唱着他们国家的民歌同中国青年一起联欢。阿尔及利亚军事代表团的贵宾也热情地同中国青年一起欢乐歌舞。哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉、智利和乌拉圭工会代表团的贵宾们，对中国青年朋友说，美帝国主义是拉丁美洲人民和中国人民的共同敌人，我们要团结起来进行共同的斗争。他们还用新学会的中国话同中国青年一起连连高呼“世界和平万岁！”
    这是一个美好的夜晚，公园里百花齐放，充满了青春的活力。夜深了，满园依然是歌声和笑语。当五光十色的焰火腾入夜空的时候，全园的欢呼声四起。多采的节日焰火，象征着中国青年光辉灿烂的远大前程。（附图片）
