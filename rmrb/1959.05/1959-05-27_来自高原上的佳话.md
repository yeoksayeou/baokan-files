Good News from the Plateau
Xinhua News Agency Military Reporter

　　　　　　Catching the Escaped Criminal
　　During a march by a certain company of the People's Liberation Army, it gradually grew dark. The mountain road was rugged and difficult to navigate. At this time, a captured rebel took advantage of a moment of carelessness on the part of the guards and escaped. When the troops set up camp, the company headquarters stayed at the home of a poor Tibetan named Wangjie. Wangjie was very enthusiastic about the arrival of the PLA, brewing tea and serving water, chatting warmly and familiarly. Seeing blisters on the soldiers' feet, he busily heated water for them to soak their feet, taking care of them in every possible way. Wangjie had lived a life of poverty and scarcity for many years. Although he was only thirty years old this year, there were already many wrinkles on his face. He hated the exploitation and oppression of the Tibetan upper-class reactionaries in the past.

　　When Wangjie heard the news that a rebel had escaped, he quietly prepared his horse and went to the surrounding villages to inquire. He returned in less than an hour with the fugitive in custody. It turned out that the fugitive had taken advantage of the darkness to run to an old man's house, falsely claiming to be a passerby and asking for lodging, hoping to hide. When Wangjie heard about this, he immediately went to question him. The fugitive initially tried to deny it, but Wangjie patiently persuaded him to honestly return to custody. Finally, the fugitive obediently followed him back.

　　A Tibetan Youth Work Team
　　The rebels killed and looted everywhere in the hometown of the young Tibetan Li Changgui. Li Changgui was filled with hatred for the rebels. Just at this time, the pacification troops arrived. Li Changgui volunteered to join and organized a work team of thirty Tibetan youths, setting off with the troops.

　　In order to pursue and annihilate the remaining bandits, they traveled day and night, fighting continuously. Li Changgui led the work team and the troops, and in just twenty-five days, they annihilated all the fleeing bandits.

　　On the way back after the victory, they encountered a heavy snowstorm. Li Changgui and others led the troops through a snow-capped mountain over five thousand meters above sea level. When they climbed the second, even more treacherous, snow-capped mountain, a blizzard suddenly struck. The accumulated snow covered the road ahead, and the soldiers' clothes were frozen as hard as armor. The blizzard whipped up by the cold wind stung their eyes so they couldn't open them, but if they stopped, they risked being covered by the snow and freezing to death.

　　Seeing the soldiers sinking into the snow one by one, unable to pull their legs out, Li Changgui desperately shoveled snow to clear a path. Just as he cleared a path, a gust of wind and snow swept over and filled it in again. He thought, "The troops are fighting north and south to liberate the Tibetan people and quell the rebellion. How can we let the soldiers freeze on such a snowy mountain?" So he lay on the snow and used his elbows to part the snow and move forward. Several soldiers behind him followed him, crawling forward on the snow. Soon a hard crust formed on the snow, opening up a path for the troops. Li Changgui, who was crawling in front, could not distinguish the roadbed because the accumulated snow was too thick. He fell into the gullies several times, but he climbed out and continued to move forward, finally leading the entire troop out of the snow mountain.

　　Back in his village, the Tibetan youth work team led by Li Changgui assisted the People's Liberation Army day and night in publicizing the Party's policies, and the masses' awareness gradually increased. Some family members of deceived rebels went to other places to call back their relatives. Those in this village who had been deceived and participated in the rebellion brought back their weapons and surrendered.

　　　　　　　A Sheep
　　Soldiers of a certain platoon of the People's Liberation Army helped the Tibetan people carry water and clean the courtyard in their spare time. In less than seven days, fourteen soldiers helped their landlord hoe the fields for 220 hours.

　　One afternoon, the landlord came over holding a snow-white lamb. Before the comrades could bring the hot tea, he said in broken Chinese, "Liberation Army comrades, this sheep is very fat, please accept it." Before he could finish speaking, platoon leader Tang Xianyi thanked him and explained the discipline of the Liberation Army to the landlord. But the landlord didn't seem to hear and handed the lamb to the soldier next to him. None of the soldiers took it. This Tibetan landlord stood up and said to everyone, "I'll kill it and cook it, and you can accept it then!" "Grandpa, thank you, we still can't accept it even if it's cooked," one soldier said. The platoon leader thanked the old man again and explained why they couldn't accept it. However, the landlord turned around, walked away, and said, "You should accept it when it is brought to you!" The platoon leader and the soldiers wanted to explain again, but he had already walked out the door.

　　In the evening, the landlord brought the cooked mutton. This troubled the platoon leader, who reported it to the company. Political Instructor Yao Dexiang of the company arrived at the platoon, wrote a letter of thanks, and led several soldiers to bring the steaming mutton back to the landlord.

　　　　　Old Granny Gives Eggs
　　One day, the soldiers of a certain company of the pacification troops were in the barracks, some reading, some writing letters, and some chatting. Suddenly, a Tibetan old lady, Shula Bianmu, walked in with more than thirty eggs, her face full of smiles. She talked to the soldiers while handing the eggs to the soldier Lin Junwen. Lin Junwen said to the old lady, "Good granny, we are staying here and troubling you often. Thank you for your kindness, please take the eggs back!" But the old lady refused no matter what, and they declined each other for a long time. She said, "Those old Tibetan soldiers with guns were like fierce gods. I was scared when I saw them. You also carry guns and live in my yard, but you are different from them. You don't beat people, you don't scold people, and you even help us sweep the yard. You speak kindly, and you always ask us before borrowing things. You are just like my own sons. I will be angry if you don't take the eggs I give you!"

　　The soldiers explained to her, "Good granny, you helped us find a house and move mats. We don't know how to thank you enough for that. Helping you with some work is what our people's army should do." The old lady was silent for a while before taking the eggs back. When she left, she repeatedly invited the soldiers to visit her at her home when they had time. (Attached picture)

    来自高原上的佳话
    新华社随军记者
            抓  逃  犯
    解放军某连在一次行军中，天色渐渐的黑了，山路崎岖难行，这时，有一个被俘的叛匪趁着看管人员一时疏忽，逃跑了。部队宿营时，连部住在一户贫苦的藏胞旺杰家里。旺杰见了解放军非常热情，烧茶送水，亲切地拉着家常话；他看见官兵们脚上起泡了，又忙着烧水给大家烫脚，照顾得真是无微不至。旺杰长年累月过着缺吃少穿的穷日子，今年虽然才不过三十岁，脸上却出现了不少皱纹。他恨透了西藏上层反动分子过去对他的剥削和压迫。
    当旺杰听到有个叛匪逃跑的消息以后，便不声不响地备上马到周围村庄打探去了。他出去不到一个小时，逃犯就被押回来。原来逃犯趁着黑夜，跑到了一个老乡家里，谎说是过路的人，要借宿，企图隐藏起来。当旺杰打听到这个消息，就立即去问他。逃犯最初还想抵赖，旺杰便耐心地说服他要老实归案，最后逃犯才乖乖地跟着来了。
    一支藏族青年工作队
    叛匪在青年藏胞李长贵的家乡到处杀人抢劫，李长贵对叛匪仇恨入骨。正在这时候，平叛部队赶来了，李长贵自动报名，并且组织了一支由三十名藏族青年组成的工作队，跟着部队出发了。
    为了追歼残匪，他们日夜翻山涉水，连续战斗。李长贵带领工作队和部队一起，经过短短二十五天的时间，就把逃窜的残匪全部歼灭了。
    在部队胜利返防的途中，遇到了大风雪。李长贵等人领着部队通过一座海拔五千多公尺的雪山，当他们爬上第二座更险峻的雪山时，突然起了大风暴，积雪掩盖了前进的道路，战士们的衣服冻得像盔甲一样硬梆梆的。寒风卷来的大雪，刺得眼睛都睁不开，但是，要是停下来，就有被大雪复盖冻僵的危险。
    李长贵看到战士们一个个陷在雪里拔不出腿来，他急得用铁锹拼命地铲雪开路。刚刚铲开一条路，一阵风雪扑打过来，又把路填平了。他想：“部队为解放藏胞，南征北战平叛匪，难道能让战士们在这样的雪山上冻坏吗？”于是他就卧在雪上，用两手肘一面分雪，一面前进。随在他后边的几个战士也跟着在雪地上爬进，很快雪上结了一层硬盖，为部队开辟了一条道路。爬在前面的李长贵，因为积雪太厚，辨别不出路基，几次掉进山沟里，他爬出来再继续前进，终于把整个部队带出雪山。
    回到了本村，李长贵带领的这支藏族青年工作队日夜协助解放军宣传党的政策，群众的觉悟逐渐提高了。一些受骗的叛乱分子的家属，都纷纷到外地叫回自己的亲人。这个村受骗在外参加叛乱的人，都带着武器回来缴械投诚。
              一  只  羊
    解放军某部队的一个排的官兵们，在空余时间帮助藏胞背水和打扫院子。有十四名战士不到七天就帮助房东锄地二百二十个小时。
    一天下午，房东抱着一头雪白的羊羔走来，还没有等同志们把热茶端来，他便用半生不熟的汉话说：“解放军同志，这头羊很肥，你们把它收下吧。”他的话还没说完，排长唐先义忙着道谢，并给房东解释解放军的纪律。可是房东好像没有听见似的，把羊羔递给旁边的战士。战士们谁也不接。这位藏族房东站起来对大家说：“我把它杀了，煮熟了你们就收了吧！”“老大爷，谢谢你，煮熟了我们还是不能收。”一个战士说。排长也再一次地给老大爷道谢，解释着为甚么不收的道理。可是，房东老大爷转过身去，边走边说：“端来给你们该收了吧！”排长和战士们还想再一次解释，可是他已经走出门去了。
    晚上，老大爷把煮熟的羊肉送来了。这事情难住了排长，他向连里作了报告。连指导员姚德祥到了这个排，写了一封感谢信，领着几名战士端着热气腾腾的羊肉送还了老大爷。
        老大妈送鸡蛋
    有一天，平叛部队某连的战士们在营房里有的看书，有的写信，有的聊天。忽然有位藏族老妈妈舒拉扁姆端着三十多个鸡蛋，笑容满面地走了进来。她边同战士们说话，边把鸡蛋往战士林俊文手里送。林俊文对老妈妈说：“好妈妈，我们住在这里，经常麻烦你们，谢谢你的好意，你还是把鸡蛋拿回去吧！”但是老妈妈无论如何也不肯，互相推让了好久。她说：“以前那些背枪的旧藏军，都像凶神似的，我看见就害怕。你们也是背枪的，住在我的院子里，可是你们和他们不一样，不打人，不骂人，还帮我们扫院子，说话和气，借东西总要先问问我们，真像我的亲儿子一样。我送的鸡蛋你们不要，我才生气呢！”
    战士们给她解释说：“好妈妈，我们住在这里，你帮我们找房子，搬垫子，这已经让我们不知该怎样感谢你了。帮你们干点活，也是我们人民军队应当做的事情。”老妈妈沉默了一会，才把鸡蛋拿了回去。她临走的时候，还一再请战士们有空到她家里去做客。（附图片）
