Ode to Zhuzhou
　　Xie Juezai
　　I live near Zhuzhou, and only now in my old age do I come to visit. The old Zhuzhou is gone, never to return; the new Zhuzhou is "just beginning, our journey's long."
　　Man will conquer nature, creating our own destiny, with full measures, unparalleled vigor, daring to think and daring to do, one move setting off a hundred. The mysteries of science and technology can be broken through; the conditions of time can be changed; one person can do the work of a hundred, one factory can do the work of ten.
　　Men and women work together, the old and young are well cared for, big families are secure, small families are happy, after work, they sing and dance. Pavilions and buildings are scattered about, flowers and trees vie for glory, without any delicate air, but with magnificent style. Wheels converge, a city of gardens.

　　I live only two or three hundred li from Zhuzhou, but this is my first visit to Zhuzhou.

　　The city has public canteens and kindergartens, and workers' families have joined the workforce, creating new and good, noble families.

　　Zhuzhou City has no old so-called prosperous streets; they are all newly built, creating a new urban garden-like atmosphere.

    株洲吟
    谢觉哉居近株洲，老始来游。＠旧的株洲，一去不留；新的株洲，“来轸方遒”。人定胜天，自创命运，十足措施，无比干劲，敢想敢做，一动百动。科技神秘，可以闯破；时间条件，可以改变；一人当百，一厂当十。男女同劳，老幼得所，大的家安，小的家美，＠劳动之余，载歌且舞。亭楼错落，花木争荣，无纤巧气，有壮丽风。车轮辐凑，城市园林。＠
  ＠我家离株洲只二、三百里，但游株洲还是第一次。
  ＠城市有了公共食堂、幼儿园，工人家属参加了工作，涌现出新
    的和好的高尚的家庭。
  ＠株洲市没有旧的所谓繁盛街道，都是新建设的，出现一种新的
    城市园林化气象。
