Speech by Committee Member Pu Xixiu

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the final state accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Second CPPCC Standing Committee.

As a rightist, I have been invited to participate in this united, leap-forward, unprecedentedly grand historical meeting. The feelings of gratitude, excitement, and remorse in my heart are truly hard to express. I thank the Party and the people for their leniency towards me, and I am determined to transform myself, under the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the people, into someone useful for socialist construction.

In the past two years, through the anti-rightist struggle and nearly a year of study and labor at the Socialist Academy, I have gained a deeper understanding of the mistakes I committed. In the years since liberation, the Party has led the people of the whole country to realize the socialist revolution through the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations. However, my political stance and ideological understanding have always remained at the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution. After the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production was basically completed, I became a "gentleman on the beam," neither touching the sky nor touching the ground, and took the opportunity of the Party's rectification to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. In 1957, the mistake I committed while working at Wenhui Daily was using so-called "freedom of the press" to oppose the proletarian dictatorship. Many anti-Party and anti-socialist news articles were sent to the Shanghai editorial department and published in the newspaper through my hands, spreading poison among the readers. The "Peking University Democracy Wall" was one example of this. On the very day of its publication, it incited students from colleges and universities in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places to make trouble. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his government work report, bourgeois rightists once misinterpreted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "masquerading as socialist 'fragrant flowers,' attacking the Party and socialism, and attempting to seize leadership in cultural undertakings."

My degeneration into a bourgeois rightist was by no means accidental; it had its historical and class roots. First of all, in terms of my attitude towards the Party, during the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, I approved of the Party's proposals for resisting Japan and democracy, but I did not understand the Party's great ideal of achieving socialism and communism for the liberation of all working people. I came from a petty-bourgeois family, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, my social status and lifestyle both rose, and I belonged to the upper petty-bourgeoisie, pursuing a bourgeois lifestyle. Although I demanded resistance against Japan and opposition to Chiang Kai-shek, I had no personal experience of the suffering of the working people. After liberation, I carried a progressive burden, did not study diligently, did not transform myself, started everything from personal interests, and pursued fame and status. In this way, I completely ran counter to the interests of the Party and the interests of the working people. In order to realize the socialist revolution, the Party led the people of the whole country in carrying out the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations in a vigorous manner. I maintained a "free little world" and engaged in news work on my own, turning a blind eye to the socialist revolution. Therefore, when carrying out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, I stood firmly on the bourgeois reactionary position and attacked the Party and socialism.

My attitude towards the Party also started from personal grievances. After I came to Beijing in 1949, I was elected as a representative to the First National People's Political Consultative Conference, and I thanked the Party. After the meeting, there were no political privileges, and I felt that the Party was indifferent to me. I had applied to join the Party, but the Party did not consider it because my conditions were not met. Instead of thinking about my own backwardness, I harbored resentment towards the Party. I have never considered problems from the perspective of the interests of the working people, but only from the perspective of personal interests. I supported the Party when it was beneficial to me, and complained about the Party when it was not beneficial to me. When a person only considers problems from the perspective of personal interests, he will have resistance to the Party, and eventually fall into the mire of opposing the Party. This is my painful lesson.

I also had resistance to the socialist system. My free and undisciplined lifestyle was incompatible with the organization and discipline of the socialist system. I also separated democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline. I wanted absolute freedom and absolute democracy to oppose the socialist organizational principle - democratic centralism. In a society of class struggle, if the exploiting class has the freedom to exploit the working people, the working people do not have the freedom from exploitation. If the bourgeoisie has democracy, the proletariat and the working people do not have democracy. The mistakes I committed on the issue of "democracy and freedom" fully demonstrated the essence of my exploiting class.

The anti-rightist struggle gave me a serious class education. First, it made me understand that I and the Party and the working people belong to two opposing classes. I must change my position and transform myself in order to return to the ranks of the people. Second, it made me understand the question of serving whom. In the past, I thought of myself first, but now I feel, what is the meaning of a life that is all for myself? In the future, I must go deep among the masses, live with the working people, and learn from them. Even if I do something small, as long as it is beneficial to the people, I will feel happy. Therefore, after graduating from the Socialist Academy, I decided to request to participate in productive labor (which has been approved by the leadership) to train myself in participating in socialist construction. I think this is the beginning of my transformation. Third, and most importantly, it made me understand the absolute nature of the Party's leadership. Leadership cannot be divided. Only the Marxist-Leninist Party can comprehensively guide the masses of the people from one victory to another based on the laws of social development. The facts of the vigorous Great Leap Forward in the past year and the radiant movement of the people's communes are enough to illustrate this. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be nothing.

The Party once pointed out that social practice is also one of the ways to learn and transform. Following the instructions of the Party, I went to Shandong to inspect and visited several people's communes and factories before the conference. The face of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture is really exciting. I learned a lot, which helped my transformation even more.

If I hadn't gone out, I really wouldn't have understood the fruitful results of last year's nationwide steelmaking. It not only completed the task of 11.08 million tons of steel, but more importantly, it also trained people, broke superstitions, and liberated the mind. In the factory, one factory has become a multi-functional factory. Taking Qingdao Textile Factory No. 6 as an example, they not only achieved the standard of "four highs" (high speed, high output, high quality, and high technology) in the textile task and won the title of "all-round red," but also established factories for steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, sulfur refining, silicon iron refining, machinery manufacturing, fertilizer powder, cement, papermaking, etc. Because of their good quality, the state has officially stipulated production tasks for steel and silicon iron this year. In the people's communes, community-run industries are blooming everywhere. Everything is from scratch, from ignorance to understanding. The machinery factory in Taishan People's Commune, which started from scratch, can best illustrate the problem: when it was first established, there were only three bicycle repair workers, a bottle of welding oxygen, and a pound of rubber. After last year's great steelmaking, it has developed into 250 people, ten workshops, capable of mass producing ball bearings, and successfully trial-producing indigenous machine tools. The people's soaring enthusiasm is rapidly changing the poor and blank face of the motherland. This is one aspect of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round great leap forward" as mentioned in Premier Zhou's report. I am willing to be with such people, and I am not afraid of my own "poverty and blankness"?

The youth's enthusiasm and the youth's daring to think and act in the style of communism are even more valuable. I visited a youth red and expert team in Chenjiazhuang People's Commune in Qufu. The captain is a young demobilized soldier, only twenty-one or two years old. After his demobilization, he first went to an agricultural training class to study for a year, and now he also serves as the technical guidance of the entire team, and regularly lectures the team members on agricultural knowledge every week. The high-yield wheat field of the youth red and expert team is indeed growing vigorously, surpassing the wheat seedlings of other teams. The female director of the commune who accompanied us invited this young captain to help her satellite field. The young man said, "I will definitely go, and then we will have a competition." This noble communist spirit of helping people first and then competing with people is what I should learn. This young man is really full of enthusiasm and dares to think and act. He is trying to plant three Chinese yams in a large pit that has been dug four and a half feet deep, hoping that one will grow to one hundred pounds. There are thousands upon thousands of such young people today, and they are good examples for me to learn from.

Xu Chenglong, a young technical innovation expert at Qingdao Comprehensive Wood Processing Factory, is an even more heroic figure. Since he invented the wood drying machine in 1954, he has invented 65 kinds of machines, large and small. Someone calculated that he completed the first five-year plan in two months, and he did 130 years of work in five years. "One day equals twenty years" has a practical meaning in him. Among his inventions, the most important are the wood drying machine, which originally cost 200,000 yuan, but he only used 2,500 yuan; the wood stitching machine, which originally cost 2 million yuan, but he only used 300 yuan; and the establishment of a plywood workshop, which originally cost 2 million yuan, but he only used 230,000 yuan due to his inventions. He also designed and created an asbestos spinning machine for Qingdao Asbestos Factory, saving 29,700 workers every year. Such a heroic figure only studied for two and a half years before liberation, his parents died, he followed his uncle to learn carpentry, and he was only nineteen years old at the time of liberation. Under the cultivation of the Party, he has become an admirable young activist. How can an ordinary young worker create miracles, and what should we learn from him? The secretary of the factory's Party committee said: (1) Learn from him to resolutely listen to the Party's words and create inventions according to the Party's instructions and the needs of socialist construction; (2) Learn from his indomitable, diligent, and persistent spirit of experimentation, and the communist style of daring to think and act; (3) Learn from his humble attitude of learning and being good at asking all experienced people for advice; (4) Learn from his communist qualities of being selfless for the public, not asking for rewards, and not talking about conditions. Each of these contains many vivid stories, which I cannot narrate one by one. The Qingdao Drama Troupe has adapted the story of his victory over the conservatives when he created the wood stitching machine into the play "A Person Who Dares to Think and Act." The reason why I want to list the above four points is that I think this is the standard of a Communist Party member, and it is the direction I should strive to learn in the future. Although this noble quality does not have a shadow on me at present, I will never be discouraged. I will strive to reach this highest standard.

The Chenjiazhuang People's Commune in Qufu, where the young red and expert team captain mentioned above is located, was introduced by Chairman Mao in the "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" with an editor's note (it was Chenjiazhuang Advanced Cooperative at that time). I bought the three volumes of "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" and only read the preface and then threw it away. I thought that rural affairs had nothing to do with me. After this inspection, I took out the book that had been lying on the shelf for three years. I carefully read this editor's note, and also read other editor's notes, and then I realized that this book has a great relationship with my transformation. Chairman Mao had long pointed out the superiority of socialism and the road to socialism with various specific examples, but I wanted to oppose socialism. I regret why I didn't study and transform myself in the past. In fact, before my bourgeois rightist position was changed, how could I have learned about socialism? It's not that I haven't read books or listened to reports at all, but many of them couldn't be understood or even misinterpreted. Haven't I also gone to various places to inspect in the past few years? But everything was like fleeting clouds, and after reading it, it was over, and no impression was left, seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing. Today, I go with a humble attitude of learning, and everything new is strongly attracting me. I seem to have gone from a cold palace to a hot and bustling torrent. I want to learn from the thousands upon thousands of people around me. After I came back, I wanted to say, write, and tell people so much. Now I understand that living in the great era of Chairman Mao, learning conditions are really prepared for you anytime, anywhere, depending on whether you want to learn, want to learn, and are willing to learn. This conference is a good opportunity to learn. I participated in both the first and second CPPCC, but I didn't have a learning attitude in the past, so after the meeting, it was over, and I didn't learn anything. In the future, I will always maintain a humble attitude of learning, first of all, learning from the working people of workers and peasants, learning in labor practice, and also learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, just like Lenin taught us: "Study, study, and study again." In the future, I will always listen to the Party's words, follow the Party, and transform myself in learning, labor, and work, and transform myself into a new person as the Party hopes.

I resolutely support all measures taken by our government on the Tibet issue. Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory, and we will never allow British imperialists and foreign reactionaries to interfere in China's internal affairs. The so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials and the second "statement" issued in the name of the Dalai Lama reveal the despicable conspiracy of the rebels and foreign reactionary forces to hold the Dalai Lama hostage, and expose their ugly state. Recently, Prime Minister Nehru said that the three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were written by the Dalai Lama himself, which also proves this point. I hail the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. The conspiracy of foreign schemers will surely fail. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, backward, dark, and cruel Tibet will become a thing of the past, and a democratic and socialist new Tibet will soon appear on the land of the motherland.

### 感激·兴奋·愧悔  浦熙修委员的发言

专栏：

　　感激·兴奋·愧悔
    浦熙修委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告和李维汉副主席的第二届政协常务委员会的工作报告。
    作为一个右派分子，我被邀请参加这个团结、跃进、空前盛大的历史性会议，心中感激、兴奋、愧悔的情绪，真是难以表达。我感谢党和人民对我的宽大处理，我决心在党的领导下和人民群众的监督下改造成为对于社会主义建设有用的新人。
    两年来经过反右斗争和在社会主义学院将近一年的学习和劳动，我对于自己所犯的错误有了进一步的认识。解放几年来，党领导全国人民通过五大运动、三大改造实现了社会主义革命。但是，我的政治立场和思想认识始终停留在资产阶级民主革命的阶段，在生产资料所有制的社会主义革命基本完成后，我便成了上不沾天、下不沾地的梁上君子，趁党整风的机会向党发动了猖狂进攻。一九五七年我在文汇报工作期间所犯的错误是利用所谓“新闻自由”来反对无产阶级专政。许多反党反社会主义的新闻稿件通过我的手发到了上海编辑部，刊诸报端，在读者群众中散播了毒素。“北大民主墙”即是其中的一例。在刊出后的当日即煽动了上海、南京等地的高等学校学生起来闹事。正如周总理在政府工作报告中指出的，资产阶级右派分子曾经曲解“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，“冒充社会主义的‘香花’，向党和社会主义进攻，企图夺取文化事业上的领导权”。
    我堕落为资产阶级右派分子绝不是偶然的，有其历史根源和阶级根源。首先在对党的态度上，在资产阶级民主革命阶段，我赞成党的抗日、民主的主张，但对于党为谋求全体劳动人民的解放而实现社会主义共产主义的伟大理想是不理解的。我出身于小资产阶级家庭，在抗日战争期间，我的社会地位和生活方式都有所上升，已属于上层小资产阶级，追求着资产阶级生活方式。尽管我要求抗日反蒋，但对于劳动人民的苦难生活没有切身的感受。解放后，我背着个进步包袱，不虚心学习，不自我改造，一切从个人利益出发，追求着名誉地位，这样便和党的利益、劳动人民的利益完全背道而驰了。为了实现社会主义革命，党领导全国人民轰轰烈烈地进行五大运动三大改造，我保持着一块“自由小天地”独自搞新闻工作，对于社会主义革命熟视无睹。因此，在政治战线上、思想战线上进行社会主义革命时，我就牢牢地站在资产阶级反动立场上向党和社会主义进攻。
    我对党的态度也是从个人恩怨出发。一九四九年我来到北京后，被选为第一届全国人民政协代表，我感谢党。会后什么政治待遇都没有了，我感觉党对我冷淡了。我曾经申请入党，而党又因为我的条件不够未予以考虑。我不从自己甘于落后着想，反而对党怀着不满的情绪。我从来没有从劳动人民的利益出发来考虑问题，只是从个人的利益出发来考虑问题，对于自己有利的就拥护党，对于自己无利的就埋怨党，一个人专从个人利益出发，对党便会有抵触情绪，最后便会掉进反党的坭坑中，这是我的惨痛教训。
    在社会主义制度方面我也有抵触情绪。我的自由散漫的生活习惯和社会主义制度的组织性与纪律性格格不入。我又把民主与集中截然分开，自由与纪律截然分开。我要什么绝对自由、绝对民主来反对社会主义的组织原则——民主集中制。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。我在“民主自由”问题上所犯的错误，充分说明了我的剥削阶级的本质。
    反右斗争给了我严重的阶级教育。第一，使我明白了我和党与劳动人民是属于两个敌对的阶级。我必须转变立场，改造自己才能回到人民队伍里来。第二，使我明白了为谁服务的问题。过去首先想到的是自己，现在觉得，一切为了自己，这样的人生又有什么意义呢？今后必须深入群众，和劳动人民生活在一起，向他们学习，那怕做一点微小的事，只要对人民有益，我都会感觉幸福的。因此，在社会主义学院结业后，我决心请求参加生产劳动（已得领导上批准），在参加建设社会主义劳动中锻炼自己，我认为这是我改造的开始。第三，也是最主要的，使我明白了党的领导的绝对性。领导权是不能分割的。只有马克思列宁主义的党才能全面地根据社会发展规律引导人民群众从一个胜利走向一个胜利。一年来轰轰烈烈的大跃进的事实，人民公社化运动的光芒万丈，在在都足以说明。没有党的领导，就没有一切。
    党曾指出，社会实践也是学习改造的途径之一。我遵照党的指示，在大会之前曾去山东视察，参观访问了几个人民公社和工厂。工农业大跃进的面貌真令人兴奋，我学习到很多，更帮助了我的改造。
    我如果不出去，我真不会理解去年全民炼钢的丰硕果实。它不但完成了一千一百零八万吨钢的任务，更重要的是炼钢也炼了人，破除迷信，解放思想。在工厂中一厂变为多能厂。以青岛纺织六厂为例，他们不仅在纺织任务上达到了四高（高速度、高产量、高质量、高技术）的标准，获得了满堂红的称号，并且还建立了炼钢、炼铁、炼焦、炼硫磺、炼矽铁、制造机械、肥田粉、水泥、造纸等厂，钢和矽铁因为质量好，今年已由国家正式规定生产任务。在人民公社中，社办工业遍地开花。一切从无到有，从不懂到懂。泰山人民公社一个白手起家的机械厂最可以说明问题：最初创办的时候，只有三个修理自行车的工人，一瓶电焊氧气，一斤橡胶。经过去年大炼钢铁已发展为二百五十人，十个车间，能够大量生产滚珠轴承，试制土机床成功。人民的冲天干劲正在飞跃地改变着祖国一穷二白的面貌。这正是周总理报告中所说的“以钢为纲，全面大跃进”的一个方面。我心甘情愿地和这样的人民在一起，还怕自己的“一穷二白”吗？
    青年的干劲，青年的敢想敢做的共产主义风格更是可贵。我参观了曲阜陈家庄人民公社的一个青年红专队。队长是一位青年复员军人，只有二十一、二岁光景。他复员后先到农业训练班去学习了一年，现在已兼任全队的技术指导，并且每周定期给队员讲授农业知识。青年红专队的小麦丰产田的确长得茁壮旺盛，赛过了其他各队的麦苗。陪我们同去的女社长邀请这位青年队长到她的卫星田里去帮助一下。小青年说：“我一定去，然后我们来个竞赛”。这种先帮助人，然后再和人互相竞赛的崇高的共产主义精神正是我应该学习的。这个小伙子真是干劲冲天，敢想敢做，他正在一个已挖好的纵深四尺半的大坑里试种三棵山药，要一棵长出一百斤来。这样的青年今天有着千千万万，正是我学习的好榜样。
    青岛木材综合加工厂的青年技术革新能手徐呈龙更是一位英雄人物。他从一九五四年发明创造木板烘干机开始到现在已发明创造了大小六十五种机器。有人给他算过一笔账，第一个五年计划他用两个月时间就完成了，五年中他做了一百三十年的工作量。“一天等于二十年”在他身上有了实际的意义。他的发明创造中最主要的有木板烘干机，原需二十万元，他只用了二千五百元，木材对缝机原需二百万元，他只用了三百元，建立胶合板车间原需二百万元，由于他的发明创造只用了二十三万元。他又为青岛石棉厂设计创造了石棉纺纱机，每年节省劳动力二万九千七百人。这样一位英雄人物，解放前只读了两年半书，父母双亡，跟着伯父学了木匠，解放时只有十九岁，在党的培养下，成为令人敬仰的青年积极分子。一位普通青年工人怎么会创造奇迹，我们应当向他学习什么呢？该厂党委书记说：（1）学习他坚决听党的话，按照党的指示，按照社会主义建设需要来创造发明；（2）学习他百折不挠、刻苦钻研、顽强试验的坚强意志，敢想敢做的共产主义风格；（3）学习他虚心学习，善于向一切有经验的人请教的态度；（4）学习他因公忘私，不计报酬、不讲条件的共产主义品质。这里每一条都包含着许多生动的故事，我无法一一叙述。青岛话剧团已将他创造木材对缝机时与保守主义者斗争胜利的故事编为“敢想敢做的人”演出。我所以要列举以上四点，我认为这是一个共产党员的标准，是我今后应该努力学习的方向。尽管这种高贵的品质在我身上目前还一点影子都没有，但我绝不气馁，我要为达到这个最高标准而奋斗。
    上面所说的那个青年红专队长所在的曲阜陈家庄人民公社，是毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”中用编者按语介绍过的（那时是陈家庄高级社）。“中国农村的社会主义高潮”三大册，我买回来只看了一下序言就丢开了，我认为农村的事与我无关。这次视察回来，我才从书架上把躺了三年的书翻出来。我仔细看了这篇按语，也看了其他各篇按语，才知道这书对我的改造的关系可大了。毛主席早就用各式各样的具体事例指出了社会主义的优越性，以及走向社会主义的道路，我却要反对社会主义。我悔恨我过去为什么不学习，不改造。实际上，在我的资产阶级右派立场没有转变前，对于社会主义那里会学习得进去？我不是完全没看过书，或听过报告，但许多不能体会甚至曲解了。以往几年我不是也去各地视察过吗？但一切像过眼浮云似地看完就完了，什么印象也没有留下来，视而不见，听而不闻。今天我抱了虚心学习的态度前去，样样新事物都在强烈地吸引着我。我好像从冷宫中到了热火朝天的洪流里，我要向在我周围的千千万万人学习。我回来后是那样地想说、想写、想告诉人。我现在才懂得生活在伟大的毛主席时代，实在是无时无刻、随时随地都为你准备了学习的条件，就看你自己要不要学，想不想学，肯不肯学。这次大会就是很好的学习的机会。从第一届政协到第二届政协我都参加了，但我过去没有抱着学习的态度，所以开完会就完了，什么东西都没有学习到。今后我要永远地抱着虚心学习的态度，首先是向工农劳动人民学习，在劳动实践中学习，也要学习马克思列宁主义，毛主席著作，像列宁教导我们的“学习，学习，再学习”。我今后永远听党的话，跟着党走，在学习、劳动、工作中改造自己，改造成为党所希望的新人。
    我坚决拥护我国政府对于西藏问题的一切措施。西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，我们决不容许英帝国主义者和外国反动派干涉中国内政。由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”和第二次以达赖喇嘛名义发表的“声明”，使得叛乱分子和外国反动势力挟持达赖喇嘛所进行的卑鄙阴谋，昭然若揭，丑态毕露。最近尼赫鲁总理说，达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军写的三封信是达赖喇嘛自己写的，也证明了这一点。我欢呼西藏叛乱的迅速平息，外国野心家的阴谋企图一定落空，在毛主席和中央人民政府以及西藏自治区筹备委员会领导下，落后、黑暗、残酷的西藏就要成为过去，一个民主和社会主义的新西藏，很快就会出现在祖国的土地上。
