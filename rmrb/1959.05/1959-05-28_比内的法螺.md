Binet's Conch Shell
    Xi Linsheng
    French Minister of Finance and Economy, Binet, recently went to the United States and made a speech to reporters that was so riddled with internal contradictions that it was bizarre.
    Binet emphatically declared: "I am not a beggar. No, I am not here to ask for money. I am not even here to ask for a further postponement of our debt repayment date."
    It is not new for those who go to the homes of the wealthy, especially those who have always gone to beg for alms, to make such a statement. What is surprising is that Binet even blew his own horn, saying that the French economy has greatly improved, and if it continues, France will be able to lend money to the United States. Since the situation is so good, why did Binet spoil the mood by comparing himself to a beggar? Binet was almost certain to be above the wealthy soon.
    However, Binet's back could not hold up after all, and he had to be more realistic. When a reporter asked Binet: What can the U.S. government and U.S. industrialists do to help France improve its economy? Binet immediately went to meet him, asking the United States to lower its tariff barriers, invest in Europe within the scope of the "Common Market," and so on. He said that this way the United States could help France's finances.
    Leaving aside whether Binet really believes that Wall Street tycoons would be so generous as to help France become the richest of the rich. But Binet's complex mood is understandable.
    No matter how Binet sticks out his chest, he cannot shake off the air of poverty. In the ten years after the war, from 1946 to 1956, France sought loans and grants amounting to seven billion U.S. dollars, excluding military aid, according to incomplete statistics, most of which came from the United States. Because of this, France has always been ridiculed by American tycoons as a "poor relative." Moreover, if you take the master's money, you have to sing the master's tune. France has had to follow American policies, which has caused France's status as a major power to plummet. Indeed, the French economy has developed somewhat in recent years, indicating that France does not necessarily have to be a "poor relative." De Gaulle's demand to break into the leadership core of the North Atlantic Group after taking office is not without foundation. However, because France refuses to abandon its Western power politics and refuses to extricate itself from the quagmire of the desperate colonial war in Algeria, France's urgent desire to strengthen its finances and economy and maintain its status as a major power has become an illusion beyond its power. Binet's claim that "the French economy has greatly improved" is just a bluff.
    According to French newspapers, since De Gaulle took office, the price index has risen by 4.6%; the purchasing power of the French people has decreased by 10%. "French Federal News" commented on the French financial situation, saying that no one denies that France is going through difficulties, and the treasury is empty. Production in important industrial sectors in France is declining, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people has increased to 570,000. At the same time, France's foreign debt is increasing day by day. In addition to the outstanding debts to the United States, it also owes 630 million U.S. dollars in the "European Payments Union."
    In this tight situation, Binet cannot pretend to be fat even if he is swollen. France not only has to reach out to the American tycoons for money, but also bows down to the new tycoons of West Germany. According to statistics, since January 1957, the total amount of "aid" given to France by West German officials under various names has exceeded 1 billion marks. Therefore, France has to pay a new price and form a Bonn-Paris axis with West German militarism, its age-old enemy. As the saying goes, those who get money from others must eliminate disasters for others. At the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers Conference, French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville could only, as French public opinion criticized, speak West German words with French mouths.
    Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to comment like this: the mood of the French Foreign Minister in Geneva is as complex and heavy as the mood of the French Minister of Finance and Economy in Washington. Since Mr. Couve de Murville felt worthy of being one of the four major powers when playing the role of a West German spokesman, then Mr. Binet can also wag his tail greatly when begging for help from American tycoons.

    比内的法螺
    席林生
    法国财政经济部长比内，前几天到了美国，向记者发了一通内心矛盾得离奇的谈话。
    比内着重声明：“我不是乞丐。不，我不是来要钱的。我来甚至也不要求再度推迟我们的还债日期。”
    到财主家去的、特别是过去一直去乞求施舍的人往往总要做这样一番表白，这已不是什么新鲜事了。令人惊奇的是，比内还大吹法螺，说法国经济大有改善，假如继续下去，法国将可以借钱给美国了。既然景况如此之佳，比内又何必大煞风景，要把自己来同乞丐相比呢？比内简直有把握在不久之后居于财主之上了。
    但是，比内的腰杆到底挺不住，还是只好现实一些。当有记者问比内：美国政府和美国实业家在帮助法国改善经济方面可以做些什么时，比内立即迎了上去，要求美国放下它的关税壁垒，在“共同市场”范围内在欧洲投资等等。他说，这样美国就可以帮助法国的财政了。
    且不说比内是否真的相信华尔街财主会有如此的宽洪大量，帮助法国，使法国成为财主之上的财主。但比内的复杂心情却是可以理解的。
    不管比内怎样挺起胸脯，也抖不掉寒酸味。法国在战后1946年到1956年的十年中，据不完全的统计，除了军事援助外，向外求得的贷款和赠款已达七十亿美元，其中绝大部分就来自美国。正因为这样，法国一直被美国财主们奚落为“穷亲戚”。而且，拿了老爷的钱就得唱老爷点的戏，法国不得不追随美国的政策，使法国的大国地位一落千丈。的确，近年来法国经济有了一些发展，表明法国并不一定要屈居“穷亲戚”的地位的。戴高乐上台之后要求打进北大西洋集团领导核心，也不是没有根据的。但由于法国不肯抛弃西方实力政策，不肯从阿尔及利亚的绝望的殖民战争泥淖中拔出来，使得法国加强财政经济和保持大国地位的迫切要求，成了力不从心的幻想。比内所谓“法国经济大有改善”的说法，不过是一种虚张声势而已。
    据法国报纸报道，从戴高乐上台以来，物价指数已上涨了4.6％；法国人民的购买力又降低了10％。“法兰西联邦新闻”在评论法国财经情况时说，谁也不否认法国正经历着困难，国库一空如洗。法国重要工业部门的生产在下降，失业和半失业的人数已增加到五十七万人。同时，法国对外债务日重，除了对美国的前债未清以外，在“欧洲支付同盟”里还欠下了六亿三千万美元的债务。
    在这种捉襟见肘的情况下，比内打肿脸也充不了胖子，法国不仅要向美国佬财主伸手要钱，而且还拜倒在西德新财主的门下。据统计，从1957年1月到现在，西德官方在各种名义下给予法国的“援助”总额已经超过十亿马克。因此，法国不能不付出了新的代价，同西德军国主义这个世仇结成了波恩—巴黎轴心。俗话说，得人钱财与人消灾。在日内瓦东西方外长会议上，法国外长德姆维尔就只能像法国舆论所指责的：用法国的嘴讲西德的话。
    因此，人们这样评论决不过分：法国外长在日内瓦的心情，同法国财政经济部长在华盛顿的心情，同样是复杂而沉重的。既然德姆维尔先生在担任西德代言人的角色的时候，认为无愧于作为四大国之一的身分；那末，比内先生在向美国财主乞援的时候，也可以大翘其尾巴了。（附图片）
