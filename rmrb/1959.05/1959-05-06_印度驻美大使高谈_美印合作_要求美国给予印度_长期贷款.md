Xinhua News Agency, Washington: Indian Ambassador Chagla delivered a speech at a meeting held by the "International Economic Development Committee" organized by American big business on the 4th. He demanded that the United States and India conduct "closer cooperation". He asserted that India is now the battlefield that determines the "democracy" and "freedom" of the bourgeoisie, and that "if democracy fails in India, the freedom of the entire Asia and Africa will be harmed". However, he admitted that the terms "democracy" and "freedom" have moved toward their opposite in the West, saying, "I have seen the worst reactionism, dictatorial regimes, and forces against freedom in the so-called free world."

Chagla demanded that the United States grant India "long-term loans" and that American private capital invest in India. He told American political and business figures, "In this decisive struggle, economic cooperation with India will be more effective in your struggle against communism than giving India hundreds of bombers and nuclear rockets and signing the closest military treaty with India." But at the same time, he asked his "American friends not to regard their economic aid plans as part of their common security plan" but to regard "aid" as a "movement to combat poverty". Because "if people in underdeveloped countries regard American aid as being provided for the sake of America's own interests, or, more rudely, as an expansion of dollar imperialism, it will create a wrong and unjust impression."

Chagla also stated that he disagreed that the so-called Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union is the most important problem facing the world today. He said: "In my opinion, there are much more serious crises... that is, the world is divided into developed and underdeveloped countries, into rich and near-starving countries." He said, "What frightens me is not the intrusion of totalitarian or autocratic ideas, but the threat of growing poverty."

B.K. Nehru, the economic affairs commissioner of the Indian Embassy in the United States, demanded at the meeting on the 4th that the United States "aid" India in the same way that the Marshall Plan "aided" Europe. B.K. Nehru said, "The absolute number of such a foreign aid plan may be huge," but "because (India's) stakes (for the United States) are so huge, in my opinion, this sacrifice is very worthwhile."

### 印度驻美大使高谈“美印合作”  要求美国给予印度“长期贷款”

　　印度驻美大使高谈“美印合作”
    要求美国给予印度“长期贷款”
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：印度大使查格拉在由美国大企业家组织的“国际经济发展委员会”4日举行的会议上发了言。他要求美国和印度进行“更加紧密的合作”。他断言，印度现在是决定资产阶级“民主”“自由”的战场，“如果民主在印度失败了，整个亚洲和非洲的自由将受到损害”。不过他承认，“民主”“自由”这些名词在西方已走向它的反面，他说，“我在所谓自由世界中看到了最糟的反动主义，独裁政权和反对自由的势力。”
    查格拉要求美国给予印度以“长期贷款”，并要求美国私人资本在印度投资。他对美国的政界和企业界人士说，“在这个决定性的斗争中，在经济上同印度合作，那么你对共产主义的斗争将会比你给印度数以百计的轰炸机和核火箭并且同印度签订最密切的军事条约时更为有效。”但是他同时要求他的“美国朋友们不要把他们的经济援助计划看作是他们共同安全计划的一部分。”而把“援助”当作“对付贫穷的运动”。因为“如果不发达国家的人们把美国的援助看作是由于美国自己的利益而提供，或者更无礼地把它看作是美元帝国主义的扩张，那就会造成一种错误的和不公正的印象。”
    查格拉还表示他不同意所谓西方和苏联之间的冷战是今天世界上面对的最重大问题。他说：“在我看来还有严重得多的危机……那就是世界分裂成发达的国家和不发达的国家，分裂成富裕的国家和濒临饥饿边缘的国家。”他说，“使我感到害怕的不是集权或专制思想的侵入，而是日益增长的贫穷的威胁。”
    印度驻美国大使馆负责经济事务的专员布·克·尼赫鲁4日在这个会议上要求美国像以马歇尔计划“援助”欧洲那样来“援助”印度。布·克·尼赫鲁说，“这样一个外来援助的计划的绝对数字可能是巨大的”，但是“由于（印度对美国的）利害关系是这样巨大，在我看来，这种牺牲是很值得的。”
