    Oil Well Girls
    Our Correspondent
    We are the oil well girls of Qaidam,
    Day and night guarding the oil wells;
    Golden crude oil gurgles and sings,
    This is our proud song…
    The song of the young people floats over the Lenghu Oilfield, and the song of the oil well girls is the brightest; the young people in the oilfield receive much praise, and the praise for the oil well girls is the most. These girls, who came from all over the country, have only been in Qaidam for half a year, but some of their touching stories have spread throughout the Qaidam Basin along with the fragrance of crude oil.
  When the weather is very cold, the wax in the crude oil may congeal and gradually block the nozzle of the oil well. No fire is allowed near the oil well, and only hot water can be used to rinse and heat it occasionally. The girls found a trick: collecting discarded car inner tubes, repairing them, filling them with hot water, and making "hot water bags" for the nozzles. One cold night, Liu Xiu'e and Ge Xiuhua, two girls from Sichuan, were on duty at a well and found that the water in the water bag was getting cold. Liu Xiu'e asked Ge Xiuhua to watch the oil well, and she emptied the cold water from the water bag and went to the oil selection station several hundred meters away to fetch hot water. It happened that the boiler at the oil selection station broke down, so Liu Xiu'e had to hurriedly carry the empty bag back. At this time, the weather was getting colder and colder, and they put their ears to the oil pipe and listened carefully. The sound of oil spraying was not as loud as before, which was a sign that the nozzle was starting to wax up. What to do? Blocking the nozzle not only prevents oil from being produced for a while, but also damages the oil well. They discussed it and quickly took off their warm leather coats and tightly wrapped them around the nozzle. Relying on the temperature of the crude oil just sprayed from the ground and the insulation capacity of the leather coat, the sound of the nozzle spraying oil slowly returned to normal.
    The story of the oil well girls' love for national property is also being spread everywhere. One day, two girls found a screw in the sand next to an oil well. It may have fallen off when the derrick was being loaded and unloaded. The girls thought: The oil field is full of ankle-deep fine sand, and maybe there are many mechanical parts that have fallen into it. They guarded the oil well while sifting through the fine sand, and they found some useful materials such as iron pipes and steel wires.
    When the two girls came back and told everyone about it, the members of the women's oil extraction team paid attention to collecting waste and old materials whenever they were at work or resting. No one returned empty-handed after work. Some carried pipes and steel on their shoulders, and some had iron nails and screws in their bags. Some of the oil pipelines connecting the oil wells to the oil selection station were repaired and welded together from the oil pipes and broken pipes they collected.
    Once, an oil well sprayed a lot of crude oil before the wellhead was installed, and it gathered into an oil pool next to the well. The oil well girls felt it was a pity to see the crude oil seeping and evaporating, so they used their rest time to scoop the crude oil out of the pool basin by basin and send it to the oil selection station. They recovered twenty tons of crude oil in three days.
    The oil well girls' behavior of cherishing national property was praised by the Qinghai Petroleum Administration. All units of the bureau held an on-site meeting there to learn from them and launched an "industrial drought resistance" campaign to collect old and waste materials.
    These more than 150 girls from rural areas in Sichuan, Henan, and Shandong have now become skilled oil workers. However, the veteran masters still like to reveal their past and tell the jokes they made when they first arrived at the oil field: when opening the oil valve, they would face the oil nozzle, and the crude oil would spray all over their faces and bodies; when on night duty, the sudden roar of gas from the oil well would scare them into hugging each other. In just six months, under the care and training of the Party and veteran technicians, they have made rapid progress. They have learned how to manage oil wells and oil extraction and selection technologies, and they have also learned how to live. At the Lenghu No. 5 Oilfield, where crude oil production is increasing day by day, these girls are like soldiers, guarding the oil wells day and night and taking over all the oil extraction work.

    采油姑娘
    本报记者
    我们是柴达木的采油姑娘，
    日日夜夜守卫在油井旁；
    金色的原油哗哗流响，
    这是我们骄傲的歌唱……
    冷湖油田上飘荡着年青人的歌声，采油姑娘的歌声最嘹亮；油田上的年青人受到许多夸奖，对采油姑娘的赞语最多。这些来自祖国四面八方的姑娘，虽然到柴达木还只有半年，她们一些动人的故事已经随着原油的清香传遍了柴达木盆地。
  天气很冷的时候，原油中所含的腊质可能凝结，逐渐堵塞油井的喷油嘴。油井附近不能生火，只有间或用热水冲洗加温。姑娘们找窍门，收集废弃的汽车内胎，修补好装上热水，为油嘴做成“热水袋”。一个寒冷的夜晚，四川姑娘刘秀娥和葛修华在一口井上值班，发现水袋里的水快凉了。刘秀娥叫葛修华看管油井，自己把水袋里的凉水倒掉，到几百公尺外的选油站去装热水。恰巧选油站锅炉发生故障，刘秀娥只好匆匆地背着空袋子回来。这时，天气越来越冷，她们把耳朵贴在油管上静听，喷油的声音不如以前大了，这是油嘴开始结腊的象征。怎么办呢？油嘴堵住不仅一时不能产油，对油井也有损害。她们商量了一下，就迅速地把身上的热呼呼的皮大衣脱了下来，紧紧地捆在油嘴上。依靠着地下刚喷出的原油的温度，依靠着皮大衣的保温能力，油嘴喷油的声音又慢慢地恢复了正常。
    采油姑娘爱护国家财物的故事也被到处传颂着。一天，两个姑娘在油井旁的沙滩里拾到了一颗螺丝钉。这可能是装卸井架时掉下的。姑娘们想：油田上到处是齐脚踝深的细沙，也许有不少机械零件掉在里边呢。她们便一边看管油井，一边拨弄细沙，果然又找出了一些铁管、钢丝等有用的材料。
    两个姑娘回来对大家一说，女子采油队的队员们不论上班时或休息时，个个都注意顺便收集废料旧料。她们下班时没有一个人空手回的，有人肩上扛着管子、钢材，有人袋里装着铁钉、螺丝。有些油井通向选油站的输油管，就是她们收集的油管、断管修整焊接起来的。
    有一次，一口油井还没有装好井口就喷出许多原油，在井旁汇集成一个油池，采油姑娘们看着原油渗漏、挥发了很可惜，就利用休息时间用面盆把原油一盆盆舀出来送到选油站去，她们在三天中捞取了二十吨原油。
    采油姑娘们爱惜国家财物的行为受到青海石油管理局的表扬，全局各单位在她们那里召开了现场会议，向她们学习，掀起了收集旧料废料的“工业抗旱”运动。
    这些来自四川、河南、山东农村的一百五十多个姑娘，现在都成了熟练的采油工人了。可是，老师傅们还是爱揭她们的底，讲她们刚到油田上时闹过的笑话：开油闸时把脸对着油嘴，原油喷出来喷得满脸满身；夜间值班时油井里的气声突然一吼，两个人就吓得抱做一团；短短的半年中，在党和老技工的关怀培养下，她们进步得多快啊。她们已经学会管理油井和采油选油等技术，也学会了怎样生活。在原油产量一天天增多的冷湖五号大油田上，就是她们这些姑娘像战士一样日夜守卫着油井，把采油工作全部包了下来。
