Xinhua News Agency, May 10th, New Delhi dispatch: "The Times of India" published a reader's letter on May 1st advocating for the maintenance of Sino-Indian friendship and opposing the instigation of anti-China rhetoric.

The letter, signed by Carvalho, stated, "At a time when people are fiercely debating the Tibet issue, it is gratifying to see that both the Indian and Chinese Prime Ministers have said that relations between the two countries should continue to be built on the same sincere and friendly basis as in the past. Some newspapers and some important figures have asked our government to re-evaluate its foreign policy towards the People's Republic of China. However, they have not made it clear what changes they want."

The letter continued, "It can logically be concluded that since they oppose our current policy of non-alignment and neutrality, the only other path would be to directly ally with the Western bloc and then become involved in the Baghdad Pact or the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." He believes that "such a policy is clearly contrary to the true interests of our nation and people."

    印度一读者投书“印度时报”
    要求维护印中友好关系
    新华社10日讯　新德里消息：“印度时报”5月1日登载了一封主张维护印中友好、反对煽动反华论调的读者来信。
    由卡尔伐耳霍署名的这封信写道，“正当人们在西藏问题上发生激烈争论的时候，看到印中两国总理都说两国关系应该继续建立在像过去一样诚挚友好的基础之上，这是令人高兴的事情。一部分报纸和某些重要人物要求我们的政府重新估价它对中华人民共和国的外交政策。但是，他们没有说清楚，他们想要的改变究竟是什么。”
    这封信接着说，“可以合乎逻辑地得出以下的结论：既然反对我们目前的不结盟和中立的政策，那么，除此之外的唯一的道路将是直接同西方集团结盟，然后就卷入巴格达条约或者东南亚条约组织。”他认为“这样一种政策显然是违背我们国家和人民的真正利益的”。
