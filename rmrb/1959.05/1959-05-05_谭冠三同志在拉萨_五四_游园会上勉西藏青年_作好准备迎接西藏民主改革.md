Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 4th. More than 3,000 young people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lhasa held a grand garden party in the Xuesecelingka in front of the Potala Palace today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. The young people who participated in the garden party angrily denounced the Indian expansionists for interfering in China's internal affairs, and unanimously pledged: to use all their strength to assist the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly eliminate the remaining rebellious elements, and resolutely safeguard the unity of the motherland, as a response to foreign interventionists.

Today, on the grass of Xuesecelingka, white and blue tents were set up, and huge banners in both Tibetan and Chinese were hung on the tall poplar treetops: "Oppose interference in China's internal affairs!" "To commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must resolutely safeguard the unity and solidarity of the motherland."

At the invitation of the young people, Comrade Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, also participated in the garden party. Deputy Secretary Tan Guansan, on behalf of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulated the young people on the festival "Tashi Delek!" Comrade Tan Guansan said: Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, Tibetan youth have become a shock force in various movements in the eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. In the battle to quell the rebellion this time, members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Association and the Patriotic Women's Association, as well as young people from all walks of life and units, have actively done a lot of work to support the People's Liberation Army and have played a very good role. He hoped that the young people would make persistent efforts, continue to assist the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits in remote areas, earnestly participate in the preparatory work for democratic reform, closely connect with the masses, strengthen self-transformation, and be good sons and daughters of the people, and good fighters of the Party.

Xuekang Tubudannima (Tibetan), Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke at the garden party. Xuekang said: The former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, like a big mountain, weighed heavily on our broad masses of young people, who had been living a life worse than that of cattle and horses for a long time. Now, they have brought about their own destruction, and more than one million Tibetan people have begun a free new life. What a great happy event this is! However, Prime Minister Nehru said that the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion was a "tragedy." We want to ask: For whom is Nehru "sad"? Those who always "sympathize" with the Tibetan people, when the Tibetan people have begun to be liberated and reborn from the barbaric and cruel serf system, actually call it a "tragedy," which is really strange!

At today's garden party, the young people unanimously expressed their boundless anger at the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to interfere in China's internal affairs. Many ordinary young workers, farmers, lamas, and students refuted Indian Prime Minister Nehru's recent remarks on the Tibet issue with their personal experiences. A young man named Awang Duoji said: "Nehru said that the Tibetan rebellion cannot be blamed on a few reactionary elements, as if the rebellion was launched by the broad masses of the people. This is a distortion of the truth. In the areas where the rebellious elements passed, the houses of the broad masses of people were burned down, many innocent people were killed, and women were raped and robbed. Could all of this have been done by the broad masses of the people themselves?"

Some soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who had fought to quell the Lhasa rebellion also participated in today's garden party. They were warmly welcomed by the young people of all ethnic groups who attended the meeting. Wherever the soldiers went, they were immediately surrounded by the young people there. The young people beat sheepskin drums, played six-stringed guitars, and danced around the soldiers.

In the evening, the garden party was still going on. In the Linka covered with lush trees, the young people of all ethnic groups, some playing the iron zither and singing loudly, praised the new life, and some danced the "Geshe" dance in a circle. They used songs and dances to express their sincere gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. (Attached picture)

### 谭冠三同志在拉萨“五四”游园会上勉西藏青年  作好准备迎接西藏民主改革

    谭冠三同志在拉萨“五四”游园会上勉西藏青年
    作好准备迎接西藏民主改革
    各族青年用亲身经历指出尼赫鲁的讲话歪曲西藏叛乱事件真相
    新华社拉萨4日电　拉萨市各族各界青年三千多人，今天在布达拉宫前的雪策林卡举行盛大的游园会，纪念“五四”运动四十周年。参加游园会的青年们，愤怒斥责印度扩张主义分子干涉我国的内政，一致保证：要用一切力量协助人民解放军，彻底肃清残余的叛乱分子，坚决维护祖国的统一，作为对外国干涉者的回答。
    今天，雪策林卡的草地上，支起了一座座白底蓝花的帐幕，高大的白杨树梢间悬挂起藏汉两种文字的巨幅标语：“反对干涉我国内政！”“纪念五四，要坚决维护祖国的统一和团结”。
    在青年们的邀请下，中共西藏工委副书记谭冠三同志也参加了游园会。谭冠三副书记代表中共西藏工委向青年们祝贺节日“扎喜德勒”！谭冠三同志说：西藏和平解放八年来，西藏青年在中国共产党的教导下，已成为各项运动中一支突击力量。在此次平息叛乱的战斗中，拉萨市爱国青年联谊会和爱国妇女联谊会的会员们，以及各界各单位的青年们，都积极地为支援人民解放军做了许多工作，起了很好的作用。他希望青年们再接再厉，继续协助人民解放军彻底肃清边远地区的残余叛匪，认真参加民主改革的准备工作，密切联系群众，加强自我改造，做人民的好儿女，党的好战士。
    共青团西藏工委副书记雪康·土登尼玛（藏族）也在游园会上讲了话。雪康说：原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团像一座大山一样，压得我们广大青年抬不起头，长期以来过着牛马不如的生活。现在，他们已经自取灭亡，一百一十几万西藏人民已开始了自由的新生活。这是多么大的一件喜事啊！可是，尼赫鲁总理说西藏叛乱的平息是一出“悲剧”，我们要问：尼赫鲁在为谁而“悲”？口口声声“同情”西藏人民的人，当西藏人民已开始从野蛮、残酷的农奴制度下获得解放和新生的时候，居然竟说是“悲剧”，真是奇怪得很！
    在今天的游园会上，青年们一致对外国干涉者干涉我国内政的阴谋活动，表示了无比的愤怒。许多普通的青年工人、农民、喇嘛、学生，都用他们亲身的经历，驳斥了印度总理尼赫鲁最近关于西藏问题的谈话。一个名叫阿旺多吉的青年说：“尼赫鲁说西藏叛乱不能由少数反动分子负责，好像叛乱是广大人民搞起来的，这是歪曲事实真相。在叛乱分子所经过的地方，广大老百姓的房屋被烧毁，许多无辜的人们被杀死，妇女被奸淫和劫走，难道这一切都是广大人民自己干出来的？”
    参加今天游园会的，还有一些曾为平息拉萨叛乱而作过战的人民解放军战士。他们受到了到会各族青年们的热烈欢迎。战士们走到哪里，就立刻被那里的青年们包围起来。青年们敲着羊皮鼓，弹着六弦琴，围着战士们翩翩起舞。
    傍晚了，游园会还在继续进行。在浓荫复盖的林卡里，各族的青年们，有的拉着铁琴，引吭高歌，赞美新的生活，有的围着圆圈跳“歌谢”舞。他们用歌唱和舞蹈来表达对共产党和解放军的衷心感激。（附图片）
