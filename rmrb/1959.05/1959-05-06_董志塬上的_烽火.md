　　"Beacon Fires" on the Dongzhi Tableland
　　By our correspondents Liu Bang, Sun Min
    The room in the Xifeng Guesthouse of Qingyang County, Gansu Province, was warm and quiet, the sheets were clean, and the bedding was soft. For travelers who had endured a long journey and tiring travel, this was a great temptation. After dusting off the dirt and washing up hastily, we spread out our bedding, propped the pillows high, and prepared for a comfortable sleep.

    We had just closed our eyes when we were awakened by a burst of urgent and loud voices. Listening carefully, the sound came from the loudspeaker under the eaves of the courtyard: "All members of the commune, employees of factories and mines, teachers and students of organs and schools! A frost warning is now being issued. Everyone should rush to the wheat fields to fight against the severe cold and protect the fruits of our labor!"

    We hurriedly put on our clothes and got out of bed, and went to the courtyard. The entire staff of the guesthouse—the director, the accountant, two seventeen- or eighteen-year-old female attendants, and an old cook—had already set off with firewood on their backs. We followed closely behind them. In the darkness, we could only see shadows of people everywhere. People were heading to the fields in all directions, divided into routes and areas. The staff of the post and telecommunications bureau were indeed "well-informed people." When the weather station reported to the frost prevention headquarters that the temperature was dropping sharply and frost was about to form, Hu Shuying, the operator on duty in the telephone exchange room, took off her headphones and immediately woke her colleagues, and acted quickly. They were the first warriors to appear on the anti-frost front in the wheat fields outside the South Gate. The young men from the Maji Production Brigade, upon hearing the alarm, took the lead and rushed to the wheat fields in one breath. Unexpectedly, there was already a dark figure swaying in the field. Taking a closer look, hey! It was Grandpa Ma Xiweng. It turned out that the old man had anticipated that there might be frost tonight based on his own experience. As soon as it got dark, he put on an old sheepskin coat and guarded the wheat field alone. Liu Zhongxin, a truck driver from the Xifeng branch of the Pingliang Purchasing and Marketing Station, had just driven a truckload of goods from Xianyang to the door. Seeing that the people from the organ had gone to prevent frost, he didn't even bother to wipe off his sweat, grabbed a bundle of firewood, and mustered his courage to join the battle. Just a dozen minutes earlier, Xifeng Town and the Dongzhi Tableland, which covers an area of 2,300 square kilometers, which had been completely immersed in the tranquility of the night, were boiling in that instant.

    Just as people had gathered in the fields, the loudspeaker issued another warning: "The lowest ground temperature has dropped below zero degrees Celsius!" Suddenly, bugle calls rang out loudly—this was the signal from the frost prevention headquarters to ignite smoke. Before the "di di da" sound of the bugle had faded, flames leaped up crackling from the scattered frost prevention stoves, quickly engulfing the darkness in front of them and dispelling the surrounding cold. Looking around, we saw flickering lights nearby and twinkling stars in the distance. But the real stars in the sky had quietly disappeared at some point. In an instant, the earth was covered with thick smoke, replacing the milky white night mist.

    What a magnificent and majestic picture of "man conquering nature"!

    Behind the Dongzhi Tableland, on the Ziwu Ridge, in front of the Great Wall battlements, and beside the ancient beacon towers, there had been similar scenes of lighting fires at night in history. However, those were the beacon fires of war. Tonight's beacon fires, however, were lit by the working people of the Dongzhi Tableland, who had long suffered from frost disasters, and after realizing the people's commune, for the first time on such a large scale, five communes jointly defended against the total attack against natural disasters.

    The smoke made the frost prevention warriors' tears flow and they could not open their eyes. Liu Fenglan, the deputy captain of the Fourth Production Team of Huangguanzhai, did not bother to wipe it off. She constantly felt the wheat seedlings like a loving mother stroking the hair of a child, sometimes at the head of the field and sometimes at the edge of the ridge. When she found that the tips of the wheat seedlings were only wet with dew and the seedlings were still safe and sound, she smiled and got up to add a handful of firewood to the frost prevention stove. Seeing that the fire was too strong, she covered the vent of the stove with a piece of soil to make the smoke thicker and thicker. The staff of the frost prevention headquarters saw these advanced operating methods and immediately promoted them quickly on the spot.

    The sky was already showing a fish-belly white. But the temperature continued to drop to minus four degrees Celsius. The frost prevention headquarters issued an order to "add another fire and finally defeat the frost."

    It was time to "fight with bayonets" against the frost. Liu Pingle, a 56-year-old member of the Dongping Production Team, took off his leather coat and covered it on the high-yield field. Then you took out a quilt, and he took out a blanket. This made the cadres of the production team anxious, and he shouted to stop them: "Comrades! You can take out mats and curtains to cover them, but we don't advocate using quilts and clothes!" However, who would pay attention to him! According to statistics after the event: the production team took out a total of 1,634 cotton quilts, 1,573 blankets, and more than 3,000 other oilcloths, door curtains, etc. that night.

    Rosy clouds held up the red sun as it rose from the east. The cold winter and frost retreated. What was coming from the loudspeaker was no longer the stern voice of the commander, but the majestic march of the People's Liberation Army. People walked home to the rhythm of the music, gently humming along. In the crowd, we heard the members discussing:

    "Alas! In the frost of 1953, all 40,000 mu of alfalfa in our town were finished. Most of the wheat fields had no yield, and those with good luck also had a reduction of more than 40%. How many people sat in the fields crying that day. This time, we didn't damage a single seedling."

    "At that time, it was still one household at a time, and people's hearts were not united. But last night, how many people did you say came out to prevent frost! Just in our Xifeng Commune, there were no fewer than 13,000 if not 15,000."

    "It is the benefit of communization, and also the benefit of weather forecasting coming to the countryside."

    While speaking, we had already arrived at Dongguan in Xifeng Town. Four middle-aged women came towards us, each carrying a basket of firewood, panting and walking towards the wild.

    "Hey! The sun is already high, and you are just coming to prevent frost?" People teased them.

    "Bah! We are delivering firewood for the third time. Take advantage of the daytime to feed the stove. Prepare every day and prevent frost every night. The farmers of our Dongzhi Tableland will not be able to rest their hearts until after April 8th (referring to the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar)."

　　董志塬上的“烽火”
　　本报记者　柳梆　孙民
    甘肃庆阳县西峰招待所的房间里温暖静谧，床单整洁，被褥松软。对于经过长途跋涉、舟车困顿的旅客来说，这是莫大的诱惑。掸去身上的尘土，草草洗刷完毕，我们就铺开卧具，把枕头垫得高高的，准备睡一个舒适的觉。
    刚刚闭上眼，就被一阵急促而高吭的声音惊醒。定神细听，声音来自庭前檐下的广播喇叭：“公社的全体社员、各厂矿企业的职工、各机关学校的师生员工们！现在发布霜冻警报，大家赶快跑步前进，到麦田里和严寒展开斗争，维护我们的劳动果实！”
    我们连忙披衣起床，来到院子里。招待所的全班人马——所长、会计、两个十七八岁的女服务员和一个老炊事员，都已背起柴草出发了。我们紧跟在他们的后面。黑暗里，只见大街小巷，人影幢幢。人们分路分片，涌向四野。邮电局的职工不愧是“消息灵通人士”，当气象站向防霜指挥部报告气温急剧下降、霜冻即将形成的消息的时候，电话总机室值班员胡淑英摘下耳机，立刻把同伴叫醒，敏捷地行动起来。他们是最先出现在南门外麦田防冻阵地的首批战士。马集生产大队的青年小伙子，听到警报，快马当先，一口气冲到麦田里。谁料地里已经有个黑影在晃动。走近一瞧，嗨！是马希文老爷。原来老汉凭自己的经验，早就料到今夜可能有霜冻。天刚黑下来，他就披上件老羊皮袄，一个人在麦田边守着。平凉购销站西峰分站汽车司机刘忠信刚从咸阳拉了一车货物进门，一看机关的人都防霜去了，他连汗珠也顾不得揩一下，挟起一捆柴草，鼓起勇气就上阵。十几分钟以前，还完全沉浸在夜的静寂里的西峰镇和方圆二千三百平方公里的董志塬，就在这刹那间沸腾了。
    人们刚刚汇集到田野里，广播器再次地传出警报：“地面最低温度已经降到摄氏零度以下！”突然，军号声大作——这是防霜指挥部发出点火熏烟的讯号。“打的的”的号音还未落，火苗就从星罗棋布的防霜炉里哔哔剥剥地跳跃而起，迅速吞噬了眼前的黑暗，驱散了周围的寒冷。我们极目四望，近处火光闪闪，远处繁星点点。而真正的天上的繁星，却不知什么时候已经悄然隐去了。大地上顷刻间浓烟密布，代替了乳白色的夜雾。
    这是一幅多么雄浑、壮丽的“人定胜天”的图画！
    在董志塬背后，子午岭上，长城堞前，古老的烽火台边，历史上也曾经有过类似的夜间点火的景象。但是，那是战争的烽火。今夜的烽火，却是饱经霜冻忧患的董志塬的劳动人民，在实现了人民公社化以后，第一次在如此巨大的规模上，五个公社联防，向自然灾害展开总攻击。
    浓烟熏得防霜战士泪水迸流，睁不开眼。黄官寨第四生产队副队长刘凤兰顾不上拭一拭，她时而田头，时而埂边，不断地像慈母爱抚着幼儿的头发那样抚着麦苗。当她发现麦苗尖端只是湿漉漉的露珠，麦苗还是安然无恙的时候，她笑逐颜开地爬起身来又给防霜炉里添上一把柴草。看看火太旺了，她又在通风出气的炉眼上盖上一块土块，让烟冒得浓些、再浓些。防霜指挥部的工作人员看见她这些先进操作方法，立刻在现场迅速推广。
    天边已经呈现鱼肚白色。气温却继续下降到摄氏零下四度。防霜指挥部发出“再加一把火，最后战胜霜冻”的命令。
    是同霜冻“拚刺刀”的时刻了。东平生产队五十六岁的老社员刘平乐脱下身上的皮衣，盖到高产田上。于是你拿出一床被子，他拿出一条毯子。这一来可把生产队的干部急坏了，他阻拦地喊：“同志们！有席子、帘子可以拿出来盖，咱们不提倡用被褥和衣服！”可是，谁理会他呢！根据事后统计：这个生产队这天夜里共拿出棉被一千六百三十四条、毛毯一千五百七十三条，其他油布、门帘等共三千多件。
    艳霞捧着红日从东方升起。寒冬和霜冻溃退了。广播器里传来的已经不是指挥员严峻的声音，而是雄壮的解放军进行曲。人们踏着音乐的旋律，轻轻地和着，走回家去。夹在人群中，我们听到社员们这样议论着：
    “唉！1953年那场霜，咱们镇上四万亩苜蓿全完了。大部分麦田绝了产，运气好的也减产四成以上，那天多少人坐在田头哭开了。这次，可没有损害咱们一根苗。”
    “那时还是一家一户，人心不齐，可昨夜你说有多少人出动防霜！光咱们西峰社，没有一万五也有一万三。”
    “是公社化的好处，也是气象下乡的好处。”
    说话之间，我们已经来到西峰镇东关。迎面来了四个中年妇女，各人手里挽着一筐柴草，气呼呼往野处走去。
    “嗬！日上三竿，你们才来防霜？”人们朝着她们起哄。
    “呸！我们这是第三次送柴草了。趁白天先叫炉子吃饱。天天准备，夜夜防霜。咱董志塬的庄稼人要把心放下，除非过了4月8（指夏历四月初八）。”
