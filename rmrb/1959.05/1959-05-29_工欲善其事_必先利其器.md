To Do a Good Job, One Must First Sharpen One's Tools
    Li Sheng
    The maintenance of machinery and equipment is extremely important for production. Good maintenance can keep machinery and equipment in normal operation and precision, ensure the quality and quantity of products, and prevent accidents, so as not to affect the progress of production. In today's great leap forward in production, strengthening the maintenance of machinery and equipment is of particularly important significance.
    Maintenance work is a basic system of production management, similar to the health department's policy of prevention first. In daily life, people may have minor problems when the climate changes. If prevention is done well, it can be avoided. Even if there are minor problems, as long as they are treated in advance, minor problems will not develop into major problems. The same is true for machines. In the process of machine operation, there will sometimes be minor problems between various parts. If they are diligently maintained and handled in advance, failures will not occur and affect production. As the saying goes, small illnesses not treated become difficult to cure. The proactiveness of prevention lies in this.
    Some people say that the production task is already very heavy and busy enough. Adding a set of equipment maintenance work will only make it more tense and hinder production. Yes, production is indeed tense, and equipment maintenance will also affect production a little. However, after maintenance, equipment efficiency is improved, and the possibility of accidents in the middle is reduced or even eliminated, which is greatly beneficial to the development of production and the completion of tasks. Otherwise, small problems not treated become big problems, which will inevitably lead to work stoppages and major repairs, causing losses to production. Which of these two options is more cost-effective is quite clear.
    Everyone understands a truth: to do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. Doing a good job in equipment maintenance is an important step in "sharpening one's tools" and is a regular and important task for all enterprises and units.

    工欲善其事  必先利其器
    李声
    机器、设备的维修保养工作，对于生产有着极其重要的关系。维修保养工作作得好，能够使机器设备保持正常的运转和精密度，保证产品的质量和产量；能够避免事故的发生，不致影响生产的进行。在生产大跃进的今天，加强机器、设备的维修保养工作，更具有特别重要的意义。
    维修保养工作是生产管理的基本制度，仿佛卫生部门预防为主的方针。在日常生活中，人们在气候变化的时候可能要闹点小毛病，如果预防得好，就可以避免；即使有了小毛病，只要预为治疗，小毛病不致发展成大毛病。机器也是这样，机器在生产运转过程中，各个部件之间有时也要出点小毛病，如果勤加维护，预预先理，就不致发生故障，影响生产。俗话说，小病不治，大病难治，所谓预防的积极性就在于此。
    有人说，生产任务很大，已经是够忙的了，还要加上一套设备维修保养工作，岂不是弄得更加紧张，妨碍生产吗？是的，生产确是紧张的，设备修检的时候，也会影响一点生产，但是经过检修，设备效率提高了，中途发生事故的可能性减少了，以至消灭了，这就大大有利于生产的发展和任务的完成。要不然，小病不治变大病，势必停工大修，给生产造成损失。这两笔账，到底那个合算，是再清楚没有了。
    大家都懂得一个道理：工欲善其事，必先利其器。做好设备维修保养工作，也就是“利其器”的重要一着，是各个企业单位的一项经常的重要的工作。
