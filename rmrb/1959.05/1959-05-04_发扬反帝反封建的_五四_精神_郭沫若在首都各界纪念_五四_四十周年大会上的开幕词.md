Dear Comrades and Friends,

The 40th anniversary of the great May Fourth Movement has arrived. Today, we solemnly hold this commemoration in Beijing, the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, which has profound political significance.

The May Fourth Movement occurred under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution. At that time, China's advanced elements accepted Marxism-Leninism, saw the future of their nation, and resolved to follow the path of the Russians. During World War I, China's working class, which was rapidly growing, provided the class foundation for the widespread dissemination of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the May Fourth Movement became a thorough and uncompromising revolutionary movement against imperialism and feudal forces, and it prepared the way for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. In the history of China's modern revolution, it marked the entry of our country's revolutionary struggle into the great era of the New Democratic Revolution. Forty years of experience tell us that only by thoroughly eradicating the ruling forces of imperialism and feudalism in China can China escape its semi-feudal and semi-colonial plight. Furthermore, only under the leadership of the proletariat and its party—the Chinese Communist Party—can the Chinese people complete the New Democratic Revolution and promptly advance the revolution to a new stage of socialism.

People have always enthusiastically commemorated the "May Fourth" because the May Fourth Movement was also a thorough and uncompromising revolutionary movement against feudal culture. China's feudal culture had ruled for thousands of years, and it was a powerful tool for reactionary classes to paralyze and enslave the people. The outstanding significance of the May Fourth Movement lies in its raising the revolutionary banner of opposing feudal morality and advocating new morality, opposing old literature and advocating new literature, giving a severe blow to this deeply rooted feudal culture. The new army of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution was initially formed by a united front of communist intellectuals, revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectuals, and bourgeois intellectuals. However, as the movement deepened, the right wing of the movement, represented by Hu Shi, betrayed the revolution and went over to the camp of imperialism and the reactionary ruling class. The communist intellectuals who adhered to the revolutionary banner further disseminated Marxism-Leninism among the people. After the May Fourth Movement, although there were various schools of thought in China's ideological circles, simply speaking, it was nothing more than the struggle between the Marxist and anti-Marxist factions. At that time, a group of intellectuals supported by imperialism and the reactionary ruling class used pragmatism, cosmopolitanism, nationalism, statism, anarchism, and other guises to viciously attack Marxism-Leninism. However, the Marxist faction was not only not eliminated, but instead calmly gave these reactionary theories resolute rebuttals, defeating them one by one. It was precisely in the struggle against various reactionary ideas that Marxism-Leninism was further developed in China, and it became a sharp weapon for the broad masses of workers and peasants to strive for the victory of the revolutionary struggle.

In summary, the history since the "May Fourth" is the history of the working class and its vanguard leading the revolution, the history of the Chinese people resolutely struggling against imperialism and the reactionary ruling class, and the history of the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China.

Today, our motherland has entered a new period of building socialism. It has entered a new period of great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production. Our common goal, shared by the entire nation is to strive to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture. With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction has already begun to appear. This is a more extensive and profound cultural revolution than the "May Fourth" era. This revolution requires us to vigorously popularize socialist culture and education, and to continuously improve it, so that the development of our country's cultural and scientific undertakings can meet the needs of socialist construction. Undoubtedly, China's intellectual circles should strive to complete this revolution! We hope that intellectuals across the country, whether old or young, can study Marxism-Leninism, constantly strengthen ideological transformation, integrate themselves with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and cultivate themselves into working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert. Only with such a large contingent of intellectuals can we undertake the task of building socialist culture.

In order to develop socialist culture and promote our country's scientific and artistic undertakings, we should continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" under the premise of serving socialism. We believe that free academic debate and the opposition of different schools of thought will greatly promote the development of academics themselves. Everyone knows that the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. The spirit of exploring truth and adhering to truth of many pioneers in the "May Fourth" era is worth learning. Similarly, competitions of different forms and styles in literature and art will certainly help to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and achieve common improvement! We are confident and expect that under the leadership of the Party, the intellectuals across the country and the broad masses of workers and peasants will study hard, delve deeply, and avoid any exaggeration and pride, and will surely push our country's scientific and artistic undertakings to an unprecedented peak in our history, and make greater contributions to the motherland and mankind!

When commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth," we must not forget that U.S. imperialism is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and carrying out various activities to invade our country. This tells us that the struggle against imperialist aggression has not ended. Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and complete the great cause of unifying the motherland.

Recently, a small handful of traitors in Tibet, with the support of imperialism and foreign reactionary forces, launched an armed rebellion and kidnapped the Dalai Lama, who fled to India. Indian expansionists inherited the mantle of British imperialism and openly interfered in our country's internal affairs, attempting to make "Tibet independent." The people of our country have already expressed their due indignation at this. Since the 13th century, Tibet has been officially incorporated into Chinese territory. The Chinese people are determined to defend their territorial sovereignty and will never allow any imperialist and foreign reactionary forces to interfere in any form or for any reason. Hasn't forty years of history already shown that when the strength of the Chinese people was not strong enough, they were already able to shatter the rule of imperialism in China? Today, when 600 million people have been completely liberated and are in the process of going all out with unprecedented vigor, how can we bow our heads before the interference of any external forces? We hope that influential politicians in India can maintain their rationality, clearly recognize the trend of the world, recognize the serious damage that the interference of Indian expansionists in our internal affairs and the support of Tibetan rebels has brought to Sino-Indian relations, and stop all kinds of unwise and unfriendly words and deeds towards our country. We hope to continue to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence together with the Indian people, which will not only be conducive to the friendly cooperation between China and India, two great neighbors, but also conducive to peace in Asia and the world.

The current social system in Tibet is an extremely backward feudal serf system, and the more than 1.1 million Tibetan people living in misery have long demanded reform. Now, due to the flight of the traitors and the rapid suppression of the rebellion, the dawn of reform in Tibet has been promoted. We believe that the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, which quelled the rebellion, and the Tibetan people who assisted in quelling the rebellion, are precisely promoting the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal "May Fourth" spirit, and we express our respect and condolences to them.

Finally, we want to congratulate the young comrades and young people across the country who are participating in today's meeting. China's youth have always been the most active, most vibrant, and most energetic force in our society. In the May Fourth Movement of that year, the youth played a leading role. Therefore, our country has designated today as Chinese Youth Day, which has profound educational significance. Young people growing up in the great Mao Zedong era are happy. The Party and the state have opened up infinitely beautiful prospects for you. I wish you the best in making the most of the light and heat of youth in the construction of the motherland!

We express our warm congratulations to the glorious warriors who directly participated in the May Fourth Movement! Congratulations to them for personally promoting the death of old China and the growth of new China, and for continuing to participate in the battle to build socialism!

We express our gratitude to the international friends who are participating in today's meeting! We are willing to express our heartfelt respect to the peace-loving people of all countries in the world through these friends!

The great unity of the people of the world is the common aspiration of progressive people in all countries. We are willing to join hands closely to work together to realize this aspiration, to safeguard world peace, and to promote human progress!

    发扬反帝反封建的“五四”精神
    郭沫若在首都各界纪念“五四”四十周年大会上的开幕词亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    伟大的五四运动四十周年到了。今天，我们在五四运动的发源地北京，隆重地举行纪念，具有深刻的政治意义。
    五四运动是在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下发生的。当时中国的先进分子接受了马克思列宁主义，看到了自己民族的前途，决心走俄国人的道路；而在第一次世界大战期间，迅速成长起来的我国工人阶级，正好是马克思列宁主义广泛传播的阶级基础。因此，五四运动成为了一个彻底地不妥协地反对帝国主义和封建势力的革命运动，并且为中国共产党的建立作了准备。在中国现代革命历史上，它宣告了我国的革命斗争，进入了新民主主义革命的伟大时期。四十年的经验告诉我们：只有彻底地肃清帝国主义和封建主义在中国的统治势力，中国才能够摆脱半封建半殖民地的悲惨境地；更只有在无产阶级及其政党——中国共产党的领导下，中国人民才能够完成新民主主义革命，并且及时地把革命继续推进到社会主义的新阶段上来。
    人们一直热烈地纪念着“五四”，还因为五四运动是一个彻底地不妥协地反对封建文化的革命运动。中国的封建文化统治了几千年，它是反动阶级麻痹、奴役人民的有力工具。五四运动的杰出意义，就在于它揭起了反对封建旧道德，提倡新道德，反对旧文学，提倡新文学的革命旗帜，给了这种根深蒂固的封建文化以严重的打击。“五四”文化革命的新军最初是由共产主义的知识分子、革命的小资产阶级知识分子和资产阶级知识分子这三部分人联合组成的。但是，等到运动一深入，原来运动中的右翼以胡适为代表的资产阶级知识分子，就投靠到帝国主义和反动统治阶级的营垒中去了。坚持革命旗帜的共产主义知识分子，就进一步在人民中间传播马克思列宁主义。在五四运动以后，中国的思想界尽管五花八门，简单地说来，不外是马克思主义派和反马克思主义派的斗争。当时，为帝国主义和反动统治阶级所豢养的一批知识分子，分别用实用主义、世界主义、国粹主义、国家主义和无政府主义等等名目，对马克思列宁主义进行了恶毒的攻击。但是，马克思主义派不但没有被消灭，反而沉着地给了这些反动理论以坚决的回击，一个个地击败了他们。正是在和各种反动思想的斗争当中，马克思列宁主义在中国更加发展了，它成了广大工农群众争取革命斗争胜利的锐利武器。
    概括地说，“五四”以来的历史，就是工人阶级及其先锋队领导革命的历史，就是中国人民坚决同帝国主义和反动统治阶级进行斗争的历史，就是马克思列宁主义在中国取得胜利的历史。
    今天，我们祖国已经进入了建设社会主义的新时期。进入了工农业生产大跃进的新时期。我们举国一致的奋斗目标，就是要努力把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。随着经济建设高潮的到来，目前已经开始出现了文化建设的高潮。这是一个比“五四”时代更加广泛更加深刻的文化革命。这个革命要求我们要大力普及社会主义的文化教育，并且不断地进行提高的工作，使我国的文化科学事业的发展能够适应社会主义建设的需要。无疑的，我国的知识界应该为完成这个革命而努力奋斗！我们希望全国的知识分子，无论是老年或者青年，都能够学习马克思列宁主义，不断地加强思想改造，和广大工农群众打成一片，把自己培养成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。只有有了这样一支宏大的知识分子队伍，才能够担负起建设社会主义文化的任务。
    为了发展社会主义文化，繁荣我国的科学和艺术事业，我们应该在为社会主义服务的前提下，继续贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。我们相信，学术上的自由争论，不同学派的对立，一定会大大促进学术本身的发展。谁都知道，真理是愈辩愈明的。“五四”时代许多先驱者那种探索真理和坚持真理的精神，值得我们学习。同样，文学艺术上不同形式、不同风格的竞赛，也一定会有助于取长补短，达到共同的提高！我们有信心地期待，在党的领导下，全国知识分子和广大工农群众一道，刻苦学习，深入钻研，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，就一定能够把我国的科学和艺术事业推向我国历史上从未有过的顶峰，为祖国和人类做出较大的贡献！
    在纪念“五四”四十周年的时候，我们不能忘记，美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国的领土台湾，并且进行种种侵略我国的活动。这告诉我们：反对帝国主义侵略的斗争还没有结束。台湾是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，中国人民一定要解放台湾，一定要完成统一祖国的大业。
    最近，西藏一小撮叛国分子，在帝国主义和外国反动势力的支持下，发动了武装叛乱，劫持了达赖喇嘛出奔印度。印度的扩张主义分子继承了英帝国主义的衣钵，公然干涉我国的内政，企图使“西藏独立”。我国人民对此已经表示了应有的愤慨。自十三世纪以来，西藏就正式列入中国版图。中国人民坚决保卫自己的领土主权，决不容任何帝国主义和外国反动势力以任何形式、任何理由，进行干涉。四十年的历史不是已经说明：当中国人民的力量还不够强大的时候，已经能够粉碎帝国主义在中国的统治，在六亿人民已经彻底解放、正鼓足空前干劲的今天，难道还能够在什么外来力量的干涉之前低头吗？我们希望印度的有影响的政治家们，能够保持理智，清醒地认清世界潮流，认清印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政、支持西藏叛匪给中印关系带来的严重损害，停止对我国的各种不明智不友好的言行。我们希望和印度人民一道继续坚持和平共处的五项原则，这不仅将有利于中印两个伟大邻邦的友好合作，而且将有利于亚洲和世界的和平。
    西藏的现行社会制度是一种极其落后的封建农奴制度，在水深火热中的一百一十多万藏族人民早就要求改革。现在由于叛国分子的出奔，叛乱的迅速平定，已经促进了西藏改革的曙光。我们认为平定叛乱的中国人民解放军驻西藏部队和协助平定叛乱的藏族人民正是发扬了反帝反封建的“五四”精神，我们向他们表示敬意和慰问。
    最后，我们要向参加今天大会的青年同志和全国青年祝贺。我国青年始终是我国社会中的最积极、最活跃、最有生气的力量。在当年的五四运动中，青年是起了带头作用的。因此，我们国家把今天定为中国青年节，这具有深厚的教育意义。生长在伟大的毛泽东时代的青年们是幸福的，党和国家为你们开辟了无限美好的前程，祝你们在祖国的建设事业中，最大限度地发出青春的光和热！
    对于当年直接参加了五四运动的光荣战士们，我们更表示热烈的祝贺！祝贺他们亲自促进了旧中国的死亡和新中国的成长，并且继续参加着建设社会主义的战斗！
    对于参加今天大会的国际友人们，我们表示感谢！我们愿意通过这些朋友向世界各国爱好和平的人民表示衷心的敬意！
    全世界人民的大团结是世界各国进步人士的共同愿望，我们愿意紧密地携起手来，为实现这个愿望、为维护世界和平并促进人类进步而共同努力！
