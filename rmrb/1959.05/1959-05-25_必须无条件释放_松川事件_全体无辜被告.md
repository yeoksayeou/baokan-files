    The innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" must be unconditionally released.
    Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    On August 17, 1949, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries colluded to create the "Matsukawa Incident," arresting twenty Japanese railway union workers. Ignoring the solemn protests of the Japanese people and world public opinion, they successively sentenced most of the defendants to death and long-term imprisonment on trumped-up charges in two trials at the local court and the high court. The countless facts revealed over the past nine years and more prove that the arrest and sentencing of twenty Japanese patriots by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries was a despicable political conspiracy. This was because the Japanese government, in order to submit to the U.S. government's war policy and attempt to clear the way for the revival of Japanese militarism, fabricated the "Matsukawa Incident" out of thin air to suppress the Japanese workers' movement and destroy the Japanese peace and democratic forces. This shameless conspiracy aroused the indignation of the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people in the world.
    For more than nine years, the broad masses of the Japanese people, who have persisted in the struggle to defend peace and democracy and strive for complete independence, have been waging an unyielding struggle to demand the release of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" with the support of the broad masses of just people in the world. Recently, a delegation from the Japan National Relief Association, headed by Hideo Namba, visited our country and called on Chinese workers and people to continue to support the just struggle of the Japanese people. We express our deep sympathy for their appeal and will continue to give our full support. We Chinese workers and the people of the whole country have always held infinite sympathy for and actively supported this just struggle of the Japanese people. When the illegal verdict of the Fukushima Local Court of Japan on the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" in December 1950 was resolutely opposed by the Japanese workers and people, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions immediately sent a telegram to the president of the Fukushima Local Court of Japan to express its serious protest to him. When the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries again instructed the Sendai High Court of Japan in December 1953 to unreasonably sentence most of the defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" to death and long-term imprisonment, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union jointly sent a telegram to the Japan National Relief Association, expressing their incomparable anger at the shameless crime of the Japanese reactionary authorities in persecuting patriotic workers, and paying high tribute to the indomitable fighting spirit of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" in upholding justice. When the Japan "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasures Council decided to designate August 17 as "International Action Day" in August 1958, calling on workers all over the world to launch a rescue movement, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions gave strong support to all innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" and the just struggle of the Japanese people to demand their release and restoration of their freedom. For more than nine years, the China People's Relief Administration and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have continuously provided moral and material support to this just struggle of the Japanese workers and people. At this critical moment when the defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" are facing the final verdict, we will take all possible means to support this just struggle of the Japanese workers and people, and resolutely demand the unconditional release of all innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident."
    We know that the struggle to rescue the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" is inseparable from the struggle to defend world peace. The "Matsukawa Incident" is one of the many conspiracies jointly created by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, so it is not an isolated event. However, the purpose of these conspiracies jointly created by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries is nothing more than to take the opportunity to slander the Japanese Communist Party, trade unions, and all democratic groups, and arrest progressive workers and righteous people, because they are standing at the forefront of the increasingly strong struggle of the Japanese people to defend peace and democracy and strive for complete independence.
    For more than nine years, countless facts have long proved that the so-called "Matsukawa Incident" is a shameless conspiracy. But why has it been delayed for more than nine years and the unjust case cannot be corrected? This is because the Kishida government of Japan inherited the mantle of successive reactionary governments in Japan after the war, was loyal to Japanese monopoly capitalists, and attempted to turn Japan back into a police state and act as a U.S. tool of aggression to achieve its potential imperialist ambitions, so as to persist in the policy of suppressing the peace and democratic forces in Japan. Obviously, if the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries is allowed to succeed, not only will the Japanese people suffer, but the peace of the Far East and the world will also be constantly threatened.
    We Chinese workers and people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, vow to be the backing of this just struggle of the Japanese workers and people, and resolutely demand that the Japanese government declare the innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" innocent, unconditionally release them, and restore their freedom.

    必须无条件释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告
    中华全国总工会副主席　李颉伯
    1949年8月17日，美日反动派合谋制造“松川事件”，逮捕二十名日本铁路工会工人，不顾日本人民和世界舆论的严正抗议，先后在地方裁判所和高等裁判所两次判决中，以莫须有的罪名对绝大部分被告判处死刑和长期徒刑。九年多以来所揭露出来的无数事实证明，美日反动派对二十名日本爱国者的逮捕和判决，完全是一种卑鄙的政治阴谋。这就是日本政府为了屈从美国政府的战争政策，企图为复活日本军国主义扫清道路，就无中生有地制造“松川事件”，来镇压日本工人运动，摧残日本和平民主力量。这种无耻阴谋激起了日本人民、中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的义愤。
    九年多来，坚持保卫和平与民主，争取完全独立的斗争的日本广大人民，在世界广大正义人民的支援下，一直为要求释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告进行着不屈不挠的斗争。最近，以难波英夫为首的日本国民救援会代表团来我国访问，呼吁中国工人和人民继续支援日本人民的这一正义斗争；我们对于他们的呼吁，表示深切的同情，并将继续给予全力支援。我们中国工人和全国人民，对日本人民的这一正义斗争，从来就抱有无限同情并给予了积极的支持。当1950年12月日本福岛地方裁判所对“松川事件”无辜被告的非法判决，遭到日本工人和人民的坚决反对的时候，中华全国总工会就立即致电日本福岛地方裁判所所长，对他表示严重的抗议。当1953年12月美日反动派又指使日本仙台高等裁判所无理判决“松川事件”绝大多数被告以死刑和长期徒刑的时候，中华全国总工会和中国铁路工会全国委员会联名致电日本国民救援会，对日本反动当局这一迫害爱国工人的无耻罪行，表示无比的愤怒，对“松川事件”全体无辜被告坚持正义的不屈的斗争精神，致以崇高的敬意。当1958年8月日本“松川事件”对策协议会决定把8月17日这一天作为“国际行动日”，呼吁全世界工人展开救援运动的时候，中华全国总工会对“松川事件”全体无辜被告和日本人民为要求释放他们以恢复他们的自由所进行的正义斗争，给以有力的支援。九年多来，中国人民救济总会和中华全国总工会曾经不断地对日本工人和人民的这一正义斗争给以道义上和物质上的支援。值此“松川事件”被告面临最后判决的紧要关头，我们将更采取一切可能的方式支援日本工人和人民的这一正义斗争，坚决要求无条件释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告。
    我们知道，救援“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争是和保卫世界和平的斗争分不开的。“松川事件”是美日反动派合谋制造的许多阴谋事件中的一件，所以它并不是孤立的事件。但是美日反动派合谋制造的这些阴谋事件的目的，却都不外是要借机诬蔑日本共产党、工会和一切民主团体，逮捕进步工人和正义人士，因为他们是站在日益壮大的日本人民保卫和平与民主，争取完全独立的斗争的最前列的。
    九年多来，无数事实早已证明所谓“松川事件”是一个无耻的阴谋。但是为什么拖延九年多之久，不能得到纠正冤狱呢？这是因为日本岸信介政府继承战后日本历届反动政府的衣钵，效忠日本垄断资本家，企图重新把日本变成警察国家，充当美国侵略工具，来达到它的潜在帝国主义的野心，以致坚持镇压日本国内和平民主力量的政策。很明显，如果让美日反动派的阴谋得逞，不仅日本人民遭殃，远东和世界的和平也会受到经常的威胁。
    我们中国工人和人民同全世界所有爱好和平的人民在一起，誓为日本工人和人民的这一正义斗争的后盾，坚决地要求日本政府对“松川事件”无辜被告宣布无罪，无条件地释放他们，恢复他们的自由。
