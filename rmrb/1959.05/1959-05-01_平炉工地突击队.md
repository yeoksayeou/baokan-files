    Open Hearth Construction Shock Brigade
    By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming
    On the bustling construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's open hearth furnace, the Yang Wancai group is the most active.
    The leadership regards them as mobile troops,
  “Wherever there is difficulty, send them there.” They also
  “Do whatever the construction site lacks. As long as the leadership asks, they guarantee to accomplish it.”
    All five technicians in the group know thirteen skills including driving, fitting, electrical work, forging, cold work, connecting air ducts, and operating machinery. The four apprentices who joined the team last September have also learned five skills including sheet metal work, welding, oxygen cutting, painting, and rebar work.
    A year ago, they only knew how to use wooden mallets to hammer and tinker, specializing in sheet metal work. At that time, there was very little sheet metal work, while other types of work were often overwhelming. Group leader Yang Wancai thought, "Why can't we learn to do other types of work?" Then, they spent three yuan to buy a small bellows and built a red furnace to learn forging. They forged hundreds of carrying pole hooks and more than seven thousand screws for the construction site in one go. Later, when the construction site lacked rebar workers, they learned to tie rebar; when it lacked pipe fitters, they learned to install air ducts… They learned whatever was lacking!
    In Yang Wancai's words, their entire group of five technicians "doesn't even have ten years of education combined," so learning multiple skills had many difficulties. But they adopted methods such as "mutual study and learning from each other's strengths" to overcome many obstacles. The construction site urgently needed welders, but only Wang Huati had learned it once or twice in his spare time. Everyone asked him to "think it over." He found a master to teach him again that night, and the next day he followed other welders to the roof frame to learn while working. In more than a month, he mastered the full set of flat welding, vertical welding, and overhead welding techniques. As soon as he returned to the group, everyone immediately asked him to be a teacher, teaching the entire group this skill. When learning to make blowers, they found a book, but no one in the group could fully understand it. They got together, and what you didn't know, I knew; what I didn't understand, he understood. Several people studied and deliberated together, and finally manufactured the first blower. They came to two conclusions in their studies: one is "If there is work, you can do it; if you don't know, then experiment. Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it." The other is "Except for lazy people, everyone is a genius!"
    The construction site cafeteria had more than a thousand people eating, and the cooks couldn't keep up, so they tried to make vegetable cutting machines and rice washing machines to help the cafeteria mechanize. To support the massive development of the steel industry, a large number of small electric motors were needed, so they managed to produce more than forty units.
    Large-scale construction of the open hearth furnace site meant that the project progressed quickly, but there was often a shortage of small iron parts such as nails and screws. When the Yang Wancai group heard about this situation, they immediately proposed the slogan "Turn waste into treasure," that is, use waste iron wire from the construction site to make nails, use waste rebar ends to make screw rods, and use waste iron plate ends to make screw caps. Making nails required a machine, so they "copied the gourd" and welded one together using waste materials, so that they could produce ten or so pounds of nails every day. In the past, they made screws by hand sawing and hand drilling, which was slow and prone to damaging tools. They then tried to make automatic sawing machines and drilling machines, which not only improved efficiency and quality but also ensured safety. They made more than a dozen kinds of machine tools such as small lathes and grinding machines, turning the group into a small factory.
    The Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Party Committee believe that their group is a red flag of technical revolution. (Attached picture)

    平炉工地突击队
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    在紧张施工的武钢平炉工地上，要数杨万才小组最活跃了。
    领导上把他们当作机动兵，
  “哪里有困难，就派他们上哪里去”。他们也是
  “工地缺什么，就干什么。只要领导上提出来，保准能实现。”
    组里的五个技工全都会车、钳、电、锻、冷作和接风管、开机械等十三种技术，去年9月进场的四个徒工也学会了干白铁、电焊、氧割、油漆、钢筋等五种活。
    一年前，他们还只会拿着木锤敲敲打打，专干白铁活。当时的白铁活却很少，而别的工种又时常忙不过来。组长杨万才想：“为啥不能学着干别的活？”接着，他们花三元钱买了个小风匣，砌上个红炉，学锻工，一次就为工地锻了几百副扁担钩子，七千多颗螺丝钉。后来，工地上缺钢筋工，他们就学扎钢筋；缺管工，他们就学安风管……缺什么，就学什么！
    用杨万才的话说，他们全组五个技工“加起来还没有十年文化”，学多种技术有很多困难。但是他们采取“互相研究、取长补短”等办法，闯过了许多难关。工地上急需电焊工，组里就只王华提一人在工余时间学过一两次，大伙就叫他去“酌量酌量”。他当天晚上又去找了个师傅教了教，第二天便跟着别的焊工上屋架边干边学，一个多月便学会了平焊、立焊、仰焊全套技术。他一回组，大伙又马上请他当老师，教的全组都会这项技术。在学制鼓风机时，他们找到了一本书，但组里没有一人能全读懂，他们就凑合在一起，你不认识的我认识，我不懂的他懂，几个人共同研究、推敲，终于把第一台鼓风机制造出来了。他们在学习中得出了两条结论：一条是“有活就能干，不会就试验。天下无难事，只怕心不钻。”一条是“除了懒汉，全是天才！”
    工地食堂有一千多人吃饭，炊事员忙不过来，他们就想法造出切菜机、洗米机，帮助食堂机械化。大办钢铁工业，需要大批小型电动机，他们就设法制出了四十多台。
    平炉工地大规模施工，工程进展很快，也就常常感到钉子、螺丝等小铁件不凑手。杨万才小组听说这情况，马上提出了“变之废为之成”的口号，即用工地上的废铁丝制成钉子，用废钢筋头制成螺丝棍，用废铁板头制成螺丝帽。制钉子需要机器，他们就“照葫芦画瓢”地，用废料焊接成一台，做到每天能出十来斤钉子。他们过去制螺丝钉是用人工锯、人工钻眼，又慢又爱坏工具。他们又设法制出自动锯床、钻床，既提高了功效和质量，又保证了安全。他们共制出了小车床、砂轮机等十几种机具，把小组发展成了小工厂。
    湖北省委和武钢党委认为他们小组是技术革命的一面红旗。（附图片）
