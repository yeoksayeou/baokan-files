   All-Embracing
    ——A Record of the Teacher-Student Relationship at the University of Science and Technology
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bin
    At the University of Science and Technology of China, both senior and junior teachers show all-embracing care for their students and are meticulous in their academic demands. As a result, students are filled with even greater confidence, and their strength to overcome difficulties is growing stronger and stronger.

  Teachers Lecture in an Easy-to-Understand Manner
    The classroom of the Department of Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering is quiet. Students are attentively listening to Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explaining some basic principles of thermodynamics. Yan Jici wrote the three characters "有用能" [useful energy] on the blackboard, turned around, and said to the students: "Now I will talk about the relationship between the temperature of the outside world and the useful energy of matter." Upon hearing this, some students frowned, and others widened their eyes, revealing a look of doubt. Based on the students' momentary facial expressions, Yan Jici was able to discern that what he had just said had not been understood by the students. He paused and said, "Let me explain it again!" He turned the topic to the matter of eating ice cream in the summer. He said: "In the summer, ice cream and the temperature of the external environment are different, so people can use it to cool off. This is the useful energy generated by the difference between matter and the temperature of the outside world."
    The current students at the University of Science and Technology are all first-year students who have graduated from middle school or worker-peasant accelerated middle school. Yan Jici knows that they have not fully adapted to university life, so when lecturing, he always uses some easy-to-understand examples to help students understand some complex and abstract theorems. When he sees two students whispering, he knows that they have not understood something just now, so he kindly says: "You two, please raise your questions!" The bell rang to signal the end of class, and the teachers should go to the lounge to rest. However, Yan Jici often disregards his own rest and calls the students who usually have more difficulties in their studies to the podium, "Did you all understand? If you don't understand, you should ask questions at any time!" The students happily surround him. Before this question is answered, another question is raised. The students are also concerned about not letting the teacher get tired, some pour tea for him, and some bring a stool for him to sit on. The bell rang again for the next class, Yan Jici holds the hot tea poured for him by the students, takes a couple of sips, and then begins the second lecture.

  Careful Tutoring After Class
    In the early morning, on the campus lined with weeping willows, students are seizing the time before class to tackle the foreign languages that need to be memorized. Students are studying foreign languages, some studying Russian, and others studying English, German, or French. In order to help students solve their problems at any time, the foreign language teachers at the University of Science and Technology are also moving around the campus every morning when the students are reviewing foreign languages. Ren Hongde, a student of geochemistry and rare elements, is sitting under a willow tree, worrying about his inaccurate pronunciation. A person walked out from behind the tree, precisely the German teacher he had been hoping for. The teacher asked Ren Hongde to read it aloud for him to listen to. Ren Hongde awkwardly pronounced the compound sound "CH" as a single-character sound, completely mispronouncing the German adjective "fixed and unchanging." The teacher helped him correct it word by word, and then asked him to read it together, once, twice, and helped him correct it four times in a row. Ren Hongde felt proficient before the teacher went to other students.
    When students at the University of Science and Technology talk about the young teachers who tutor them, they feel even closer than talking about their own older brothers and sisters. Li Tianwu, a student in Class 4 of the Department of Automation, was originally a lathe operator. He only studied the middle school curriculum for four years in a worker-peasant accelerated middle school, so his foundation was weak and he had many difficulties in learning. The tutors for each subject, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and foreign languages, would answer his questions whenever he came to them. He also told me that his classmate Yang Yintang injured his arm and was hospitalized. The teacher who tutored mathematics, Wang Ruiting, from the first week he was admitted to the hospital, recorded the new lessons taught by the main lecturer and went to the hospital to teach Yang Yintang, without hindering his recovery. Yang Yintang stayed in the hospital for three months, and Wang Ruiting went to the hospital to teach him for three months. Ma Chongfang, a student in the Department of Physics and Thermal Engineering, did not understand the concept of limits in mathematics. He went to the teacher Shi Guangjie, who felt that he needed to prepare before answering. Three days later, Ma Chongfang had already forgotten about it, but Shi Guangjie came to him and gave a detailed explanation.

  Helping Students Manage Time
    Some of these young students do not know how to manage their time scientifically, and do not know how to combine work and rest with a rhythmic study and rest schedule. Guo Yancai, from the Department of Automation, often burned the midnight oil until twelve o'clock at night. His white clothes became dirty and black, and when his classmates asked him to wash them, he always said: "I can't keep up with my studies and I don't have time." Another female student, Jia Xiuzhen, was seen studying all the time, but when students talked to her about her studies, she always frowned and said: "No, I'm too stupid!" At the end of April, Guo Yancai's dormitory had a new roommate. He was Liu Hong, the deputy director of the Department of Automation and also the Party branch secretary of this department. In advance, he prepared a schedule of study and rest for Guo Yancai, Jia Xiuzhen, and other students, and also studied with them the methods of previewing, listening to lectures, and reviewing. He moved into the dormitory of Guo Yancai and other students to observe specifically whether the planned schedule and methods could be effective. A week later, Guo Yancai's clothes were clean, and he no longer burned the midnight oil. Jia Xiuzhen's face also showed a cheerful smile. In the temporary test, they both scored a four. Jia Xiuzhen said to me: "Crystal is the most transparent. The understanding of us by the leading cadres and teachers is like looking at crystal."

  Students Respect Teachers
    The teachers' spirit of dedication and responsibility greatly encouraged the students' enthusiasm for learning. The students in Class 2 of the Department of Biophysics wrote in a big-character poster: "We did not carefully read the assignments corrected by the teachers, and we did not use our own brains enough to solve problems, and we are too dependent on the teachers. These are all manifestations of disrespect and lack of appreciation for the teachers' labor. Thinking of the teachers' enthusiastic and patient attitude, we feel extremely ashamed." They expressed that they must correct this shortcoming and study even harder.
    The students understand the teachers' hearts even more sincerely and respect their teachers. In the classroom of the Department of Radio and Electronics, whenever a teacher is about to give a lecture, many students bring teacups and thermos bottles in unison, sometimes filling the table on the podium, far exceeding the needs of a teacher. A young teacher, Xu Shuqian, was also busy tutoring students on holidays, and his hair and beard were very long. When he came to the study room of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computational Technology, as soon as he sat down, a student put a bib around his neck, and then took out scissors and a razor to give him a haircut. He asked to do it after finishing his homework, but the students did not allow him to do it himself and gave him a haircut before proceeding with their studies. One day last month, a strong wind blew and the weather suddenly turned cold. A young teacher, Zheng Xianzhong, went to the cafeteria for dinner wearing a jacket. When students from the Department of Automation saw him, they immediately took off their own cotton-padded coats and gave them to him to wear. Zheng Xianzhong refused to accept it, but the student said: "Put it on, don't get cold. If you're not in good health, you won't be able to give lectures tomorrow." When Zheng Xianzhong talked to other teachers about this, he said: "This sentence from the student is much warmer than a cotton coat!"
    Teachers love students, students respect teachers, teachers and students love each other, and teaching and learning promote each other. The teachers and students of the University of Science and Technology of China are working together in this way for teaching and learning. In the first midterm exam, most of the students achieved excellent or good grades. In the face of such united teachers and students, they will achieve greater victories. (Attached picture)

   无微不至
    ——记科技大学的师生关系
    本报记者  朱彬
    在中国科学技术大学里，不论是年长的或是年轻的教师，对学生的关怀真是无微不至，在学习上对学生的要求也一丝不苟；而学生们在学习上更加充满了信心，一种克服困难的力量，越来越旺盛。
  教师讲课通俗易懂
    力学和力学工程系的课堂里肃静无声。学生聚精会神的在听中国科学院技术科学部主任严济慈讲热力学中的一些基本原理。严济慈在黑板上写了“有用能”三个字，转过身来对学生说：现在讲外界的温度和物质的有用能的关系。学生们听了，有的绉绉眉头，有的眼睛瞪的大大的露出了疑问的神情。严济慈凭着他的细心从学生们一刹那的面部表情上看出来，他刚才讲的没有被学生所理解。他停顿了一下说“我重讲吧”！他把话题转向了夏天吃冰棋凌的事。他说：在夏天冰棋凌和外界环境的温度不同，因此人们就可以利用它来解热。这就是物质和外界温度差异而产生的有用能。
    科技大学目前现有的学生都是中学或工农速成中学毕业的一年级学生。严济慈知道他们对大学的学习生活还没有完全习惯，讲课时碰到一些复杂而抽象的定理时，总是借一些通俗的例子帮助学生理解。他看到有两个学生在低声私语，就知道他们刚才有什么问题没弄懂，就亲切地说：“你们两个把问题提出来吧！”下课的铃声响了，教师们应该到休息室里去休息。严济慈却常常不顾自己的休息，仍把一些平时学习上困难比较多的学生招到讲台前，“你们都听懂了吗？不懂的要随时提出来问！”学生们高兴地把他围起来。这个问题还没有解答完，另一个问题又提出来了。学生们也关心别让教师累着了，有的给他倒茶，有的搬来凳子请他坐。上课的铃声又响了，严济慈端着学生给他倒的热茶，喝上两口，接着就又开始了第二堂的讲授。
  课后认真辅导
    清晨，在垂柳成行的校园里，学生们都在抓紧这上课以前的时间对付那需要记忆的外文。学生们都在学习外国语，有学俄文的，也有学英文、德文或法文的。科技大学的外文教员，为了帮助学生随时解决疑难问题，每天早晨学生们在复习外文时，他们也全在校园里走动。地球化学和稀有原素的学生任鸿德，坐在柳树下，正为自己的发音不准确而着急的时候，树后走出了一个人，正是他所盼望的德文教师。教师要任鸿德念一遍给他听听。任鸿德格格吧吧的把CH这个复合音总是念成一个字的音，把德文里“固定不变的”这个形容词完全念走了调，教师一个字一个字的帮助他改正，然后要他连起来念，一遍、两遍，一连帮他纠正了四遍。任鸿德感到熟练了，他才走向别的学生那里去。
    科技大学的学生谈起辅导他们的青年教师，比谈自己的哥哥姐姐还要亲。自动化系四班学生李天武，原来是个车工，中学的课程在工农速成中学里只念了四年，根底浅学习中困难多。数学、物理、化学、外文每门课的辅导教师对他这样的学生，都是什么时候有问题找上门就什么时候解答。他还告诉我这样一件事，他的同学杨荫堂手臂伤了进了医院，辅导数学课的教师王瑞庭从他进院的第一个星期起，在不妨碍他养伤的情况下，每逢主讲教师讲了新课，他就记下来到医院去讲给杨荫堂听。杨荫堂在医院里住了三个月，王瑞庭也到医院去为他教了三个月的课。物理热工系学生马重芳对数学里的极限概念弄不清，他去找教师史光洁，史光洁当时感到需要准备一下再作答复。过了三天，马重芳已经把这件事忘了，而史光洁却来找他作了详细的解释。帮助学生支配时间
    这些青年学生中有些人不懂得科学的支配时间，不会劳逸结合有节奏的学习、休息。自动化系的郭言彩常常晚上开夜车到十二点，身上的白衣服脏成黑的了，同学们要他洗，他总说：“学习跟不上没有时间。”另外一个女学生贾秀珍，人们看她每时每刻都在学习，可是学生们一和他谈起功课时，她老绉起眉头说：“不行，我太笨了！”4月底的一天郭言彩的宿舍里添了一个人，他是自动化系副主任也是这个系的党支部书记刘宏。事先他为郭言彩、贾秀珍等学生拟制了学习、休息的时间计划表，还和他们研究了预习、听课、复习的方法。他住进郭言彩等学生的宿舍，就是为了和具体地观察拟订的计划和方法能不能行之有效。一个星期以后，郭言彩的衣服干净了，也不开夜车了。贾秀珍的脸上也露出了舒畅的微笑。临时测验中，他们两人都考了四分。贾秀珍对我说：“水晶最透明了，领导干部和教师对我们的了解，就好像看水晶一样。”
    学生敬爱老师
    教师们这种认真负责的精神，大大地鼓励了学生们的学习积极性。生物物理系二班的学生在大字报上写道：经老师批改过的作业我们没有认真细看，有了问题自己动脑筋不够，好依赖教师，这都是对老师的劳动不尊重不爱惜的表现，想起老师那种热情耐心的态度，心里感到万分羞愧。他们表示一定要改正这个缺点，更加刻苦钻研。
    学生们体谅教师的心，也更加真挚的敬爱自己的老师。无线电电子系的课堂里，每当要有教师来讲课，许多学生都不约而同的拿来了茶杯和暖瓶，有时排满了讲台上的桌子，远远超过了一个教师的需要。有一位青年教师许树谦假日里也忙着给学生辅导功课，头发和胡子都很长了。他来到应用数学和计算技术系的自习室里，他一坐下一个学生就在他的脖子上围上了围布，然后拿出了剪子和剃刀给他理发，他要求作完功课后再理，学生们不容他自主，给他理完后才进行学习。上个月有一天刮大风天气骤冷，青年教师郑仙仲穿了件夹大衣就到食堂吃饭，自动化系的学生看到了他，立即脱下自己身上的棉袄给他穿，郑仙仲不肯接受，那个学生说：“你穿上吧，别冻着了，身体不好，明天就不能讲课了。”郑仙仲在和其他教师谈起这件事情时说：“学生这句话比棉衣还要暖多少倍！”
    教师爱学生，学生敬教师，师生相爱，教学相长，中国科学技术大学的师生们为了教和学，就是这样同心协力的努力着。第一次期中考试时大多数的学生都获得了优或良的成绩，在这样团结一致的师生面前，他们将会取得更大的胜利。（附图片）
