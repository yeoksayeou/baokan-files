Comrade Wu Jinhang's Speech on the Gains from Study

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 state final accounts and the draft 1959 state budget, and Minister Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. I celebrate the glorious achievements of our great motherland under the leadership of the Party!

Rich Harvests from Two Years of Study

I used to be a financial capitalist and am now sixty-six years old. In order to strengthen my self-reform, I applied to the organization in 1956 for permission to study at the Socialist Academy. The gains from studying for more than two years have been very rich. The Socialist Academy has taken various measures in its teaching to guide us patiently. We studied basic Marxist-Leninist theory courses such as political economy, dialectical materialism, and the history of the Chinese revolution, received socialist and communist education, participated in the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, confided in the Party, formulated self-reform plans, and combined visits and participation in productive labor. Under the education of the academy leaders and the help of my classmates, I have gained a lot. Compared with before I entered the school, my position has changed and my ideological understanding has also improved. As the ancients said: "Learning reveals deficiency." The more I study, the more I feel my emptiness, and the more I feel that if I don't study and don't reform, I will fall behind the times. Now I will talk about the main gains in my study:

1.  Through participating in physical labor, I have begun to have the ideological feelings of the working people.

The average age of the students of the Socialist Academy is about fifty-five years old. In order to implement the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, and also taking into account the physical strength of the students, the academy organized us to participate in some light half-day agricultural labor. Although we did not live and eat with the farmers, contact with our farmer brothers during labor has also profoundly educated us. I came from a bureaucratic landlord family, received feudal education, and lived the life of a capitalist for a long time. I never engaged in labor, was unaccustomed to physical work, did not know the five grains, despised labor and the working people, and even thought myself superior. Only in labor practice did I realize my ignorance and incompetence. I could not do technical work, and heavy work was too much for me. I was not even qualified to be an assistant to a farmer, and I truly realized that every piece of clothing and food does not come easily. Only then did I understand why the working people hate the exploiting classes and recognize the shamefulness and heinousness of exploitation. I resolutely gave up "fixed interest" and cut off the tail of exploitation. This is exactly what I should do to make amends to the working people.

2.  Preliminary establishment of the working class's stand, viewpoint, and method.

After studying theory, participating in the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, my bourgeois stand and thinking have changed somewhat. I have realized the laws of social development, that the bourgeoisie must be eliminated, and should be eliminated. The working class's stand and thinking are in line with the truth, and I should gradually stand firm on the working class's stand and use the working class's viewpoint and method to analyze and deal with problems at all times. I feel that I have made some progress in this regard.

3.  Beginning to get used to collective life, and not harboring concerns about the people's communes.

Since last summer vacation, the Socialist Academy has moved to the suburbs, and I and the vast majority of my classmates live in the academy. From morning to night, it is collective life. I take care of cleaning, fetching water, and other things myself. For those of us who were free and undisciplined, used to having food brought to our mouths and clothes laid out for us, it was not easy at first, but after half a year, we gradually got used to it. Eating in the canteen and managing our own lives is also quite enjoyable. Collective life cultivates collectivist thinking, which is of great benefit to overcoming bourgeois individualism.

Continue to Work Hard on Remolding

As a national bourgeois element in New China, I feel very fortunate. The Party implements a policy of peaceful remolding for us, using various methods to help us carry out self-remolding, so that we have embarked on the socialist road. I thank the Party for its ten years of cultivation and education. However, due to insufficient subjective efforts, even today, the remolding is still far from complete, the two-sidedness still exists, and there are still reversals in the remolding process from time to time. Although I have initially realized some truths after more than two years of study, it does not mean that I have been completely remolded, and I must not develop a mentality of being tired of remolding. I deeply realize that remolding one's thinking is like sailing against the current; if you don't advance, you will retreat, and it is impossible to stop in the middle reaches. Some of the understandings gained from learning urgently need to be tested in practice, and leaving the academy is the beginning of practice. I will certainly follow the principles determined by the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Central Conference at the beginning of the year: taking political and ideological remolding as the commander, taking enterprises or work positions as the base, and taking labor and practice as the foundation, and continue to carry out essential remolding. Taking the six political criteria as the standard, wholeheartedly accept the leadership and education of the Party, and contribute my meager strength to the socialist construction cause of our great motherland.

Absolutely No Interference in Our Internal Affairs is Allowed

Finally, I am extremely indignant about the fact that a small handful of Tibetan traitors who fled to India, colluding further with imperialists and Indian expansionists, continue to kidnap the Dalai Lama, and repeatedly use the Dalai Lama's name to issue so-called "Dalai Lama statements" that distort the truth and slander our government! This small handful of reactionary Tibetan upper-class elements who fled to India, willing to rely on imperialism and foreign reactionaries, have committed heinous crimes of treason. They have been abandoned by the Tibetan compatriots and the people of the whole country, and are doomed to destruction, which is hateful! Indian expansionists, including many political leaders, are taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to openly support the Tibetan traitors, and have repeatedly issued remarks interfering in our internal affairs and undermining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, exposing their expansionist ambitions and conspiracies to serve imperialism. This is absolutely intolerable to the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up. Here, I solemnly warn the Indian interventionists: No foreigners are allowed to interfere in our country's internal affairs. The provocations of the interventionists will be met with a counterattack from 650 million iron fists. I advise you to rein in at the edge of the cliff, and do not work for imperialism, which will not benefit a country that is known for its peace and neutrality.

Finally, I wish all the committee members good health!

    学然后知不足
    吴晋航委员谈学习的收获主席、各位委员：
    周总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，李维汉部长关于第二届政协全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，我完全拥护，并为我们伟大的祖国在党的领导下所获得的辉煌成就而欢庆！
    两年来学习收获丰富
    我过去是一个金融资本家，今年六十六岁。为了加强自我改造，曾于一九五六年请求组织上批准入社会主义学院学习。两年多来学习的收获是很丰富的。社会主义学院在教学中采取各项措施，对我们循循善诱。我们学习了政治经济学、辩证唯物论、中国革命史等马列主义理论基础课和受了社会主义、共产主义教育，参加了整风运动和反右斗争，向党交心并制订自我改造规划，结合参观和参加生产劳动。在学院领导的教育和同学们的帮助下，有不少收获。与入学前比较起来，自己的立场是有了转变，思想认识也有所提高。前人说过：“学然后知不足”，我正是愈学习愈感到自己空虚，愈感到不学习，不改造，就会落在时代的后面。我现在谈谈学习中的主要收获：
    一、通过参加体力劳动，开始有了劳动人民的思想感情。
    社会主义学院学员年龄平均约五十五岁，学院为了贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，又照顾到同学们的体力，组织我们参加一些轻微的半日的农业劳动。尽管我们没有做到同农民同食同住，但在劳动时同农民弟兄接触，也使我们受到深刻的教育。我出身于官僚地主家庭，受的封建教育，长期过着资本家生活，根本不事劳动，一向四体不勤，五谷不分，轻视劳动和劳动人民，还自以为高人一等。在劳动实践中，才显出自己的无知无能，技术性的活干不了，重活又吃不消，做农民的一个助手都不合格，真实地体会到一衣一食来之不易。这才懂得劳动人民为什么憎恨剥削阶级，认识到剥削的可耻可恶，我坚决放弃“定息”，斩去剥削的尾巴，这正是自己对劳动人民补过自赎的所应该做的事。
    二、初步建立工人阶级的立场、观点、方法。
    经过学习理论、参加整风和反右斗争，自己的资产阶级立场、思想有所转变，认识到社会发展规律，资产阶级必然消灭，也应当消灭。工人阶级立场思想才是符合真理的，自己应该逐步站稳工人阶级立场，随时随地用工人阶级的观点、方法来分析问题、处理问题。自己觉得在这方面有了一点进步。
    三、开始习惯集体生活，对于人民公社化不怀顾虑。
    从去年暑假以后，社会主义学院迁至郊外，我和绝大多数同学都住在学院里。从早到晚都是集体生活，自己料理扫除、取水等事，这对我们这些一个自由散漫、饭来张口、衣来伸手的人，最初是不习惯的，半年之后，逐步习惯了。吃食堂自己管理生活，过得也满愉快。集体生活培养集体主义思想，对于克服资产阶级的个人主义，有很大好处。
    还要继续努力改造
    作为一个新中国的民族资产阶级分子，我觉得是很幸运的。党对我们实行和平改造的政策，用多种多样的方式来帮助我们进行自我改造，使我们走上了社会主义的道路。我感谢党十年对我的培养教育。但是，由于主观努力不够，直到今天，改造得还是差得很远，两面性依然存在，改造过程中还时有反复。虽然经过两年多的学习，初步认识到一些真理，但不等于已经改造好了，决不能产生厌倦改造的心理。我深深体会到改造思想，如逆水行舟，不进则退，停顿于中游是不可能的，从学习中所获得的一些认识，还迫切地需要在实践中去考验，出了学院就是实践的开始。我一定遵循年初中国民主建国会和全国工商联中央会议所决定的：以政治思想改造为统帅，以企业或工作岗位为基地，以劳动和实践为基础的方针，继续不断地进行本质改造。以六项政治标准为准则，全心全意地接受党的领导和教育，为伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业，贡献出自己微末的力量。
    决不容许干涉我国内政
    末了，我对于逃到印度去的一小撮西藏叛国分子，与帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子进一步勾结，继续劫持达赖喇嘛，一再假借达赖喇嘛名义，发表颠倒是非、污蔑我政府的所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”一事，感到万分愤慨！这一小撮逃亡印度的西藏上层反动分子，甘心投靠帝国主义和外国反动派，犯下罪大恶极的叛国罪行，他们已遭到藏族同胞及全国人民的唾弃，自取灭亡，令人痛恨！印度扩张主义分子，包括许多政治领导人物在内，利用西藏叛乱，竟公开支持西藏叛国分子，一再发表干涉我们内政，破坏和平共处五项原则的言论，暴露他们为帝国主义服务的扩张野心和阴谋。这是我们站起来了的六亿五千万中国人民所绝对不能容忍的，我在此正告印度干涉者：我国的内政绝不容许任何外国人干涉，干涉者的挑衅行为将遭到六亿五千万双铁拳的回击。奉劝你们还是临崖勒马，不要给帝国主义效劳，那对于一个素称和平中立的国家是不会有好处的。
    最后，敬祝各位委员身体健康！
