    Jiang'an Vehicle Depot Uses Blackboard Operation Plan to Master Daily Production Progress

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 8th dispatch) The Jiang'an Vehicle Depot's repair workshop of the Wuhan Railway Administration uses a blackboard operation plan to grasp the daily production progress, achieve daily completion of the production plan, change the past phenomenon of being lax at the beginning and tight at the end in the execution of the monthly plan, and greatly promote production.

    The Jiang'an Vehicle Depot's repair workshop completed the first quarter plan nineteen days ahead of schedule, but there was still a phenomenon of uneven workload, being "lax at the beginning and tight at the end," in the completion of the plan. Since mid-March, the workshop leaders have used a blackboard operation plan to grasp the daily production progress and organize balanced production. The specific method is: as soon as each vehicle to be repaired enters the workshop, a small blackboard is hung on it. In addition to indicating the model, vehicle number, and overall repair progress, the completion plan time and requirements are also filled in according to processes such as wheelsets, bogies, couplings, braking, and carpentry. Workers of each work type also fill in the plan and execution status, and if the plan is not completed, the reasons must be stated. The workshop leaders analyze the production situation every day and deal with various problems in a timely manner. This has the following advantages: First, the workers of each work type have clear goals, actively cooperate with each other, and make the upper and lower processes closely linked. The upper and lower processes are interlocked and organized very closely. This has changed the past phenomena of the plan being unspecific, the various work types being unclear in their minds, and the lack of close contact, greatly accelerating the production progress. Second, the leaders have a clear understanding of the situation, can timely discover and solve key problems, and organize production well. After having the blackboard operation plan, the leaders analyze the progress of vehicle repair every day, know how many vehicles can be dispatched that day, and what accessories are needed, and organize the supply in a timely manner to ensure that vehicles are dispatched every morning. Third, due to the daily completion of the plan, production rises in a balanced manner, avoiding the phenomenon of rushing to work at the last minute, and the quality of vehicle repair is improved. Since April, there have been no major rework or repair accidents, and the vehicles leaving the factory meet the specifications.

    江岸车辆段运用小黑板作业计划
    掌握每天生产进度
    本报武汉8日电　武汉铁路管理局江岸车辆段的修理工场，运用小黑板作业计划，掌握每日生产进度，做到按日完成生产计划，改变了过去在执行月计划中前松后紧的现象，大大推动了生产。
    江岸车辆段的修理工场提前十九天完成了第一季度计划，但在完成计划中还存在着“前松后紧”忙闲不均的现象。从3月中旬起，工场领导就运用小黑板作业计划，掌握每日生产进度，组织均衡生产。其具体作法是：待修的每辆车辆一进场，就挂上一块小黑板，上面除标明这辆车的型号、车号、修理总进度外，还按轮轴、台车、连结、制动、木工等工序，填上完成计划的时间和要求，各工种工人也将计划和执行情况填上，如没有完成计划要写明原因，工场领导方面每天分析生产情况，对各种问题及时处理。这样做，有以下几个好处：第一、各工种工人奋斗目标明确，相互主动配合，使上下工序紧密衔接。上下工序一环扣一环，组织得很紧密。这就改变了过去计划不具体，各个工种心中无数，联系不密切的现象，大大加快了生产进度。第二、领导人心中有数，能及时发现和解决关键问题，组织好生产。有了小黑板作业计划后，领导人每天分析修车进度，知道当天能出几辆车，还需要什么配件，就及时组织供应，做到每天上午都有车辆出场。第三、由于按日完成计划，生产均衡上升，避免了突击赶工的现象，车辆修理质量提高。4月份以来一直没有发生过重大的返工重修事故，出厂车辆都合乎规格。
