    Henan Province Arranges Wheat Seed Selection Work
    Jiangsu Yangzhong County Determines Over Ten Thousand Mu of Seed Fields
    This Dispatch from Zhengzhou, May 15th – With the wheat in Henan Province nearing maturity, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture recently convened a meeting of bureau chiefs from specialized regions and cities, along with directors of agricultural science research institutes, to lay a solid foundation for future harvests. The meeting emphasized the importance of initiating and executing wheat seed selection work early and effectively, cultivating and discovering new varieties, and enhancing existing superior varieties to improve overall seed quality.
    This year's wheat seed selection work, under the new circumstances following the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, presents new tasks. Wheat fields are now generally ploughed deeper, planted more densely, fertilized more heavily, and managed more meticulously than in the past, with the development of numerous large-scale high-yield plots. These changes necessitate correspondingly higher seed quality. Based on these developments, the "Zhongnong 28" and "Huixian Red" varieties, previously overlooked for their resistance to lodging and high-yield, fertilizer-tolerance, should be extensively developed in the future. The "Nanda 2419" variety, already developed for its good quality, high yield, and lodging resistance, should continue to be promoted. The "Bima No. 1" variety, widely promoted for its strong adaptability but lacking lodging resistance, should be maintained at its current level. Simultaneously, inferior varieties such as "Foshou Mai" and "Tu'er Mang Mai" should be phased out. The meeting also emphasized the need to popularize superior varieties, systematize the breeding system, diversify superior varieties, and institutionalize seed storage practices.
    Given the tight timeframe and heavy workload for this year's wheat seed selection, regions are establishing seed selection organizations from the provincial level down to the people's communes, assigning full-time cadres. Each production team will form specialized seed selection teams, with tiered responsibilities, and launch variety-based teams. Agricultural science departments, experimental farms' technicians, and local experts will form teams to take responsibility for specific areas, focusing on key points, comprehensively collecting data, and developing seed selection plans. This involves taking responsibility for land plots, varieties, and specialized teams, as well as setting timelines, tasks, quality standards, and seed selection work points.
    With professional teams in place, regions must also mobilize the masses to conduct mass seed selection work, providing technical training to ensure everyone understands seed selection requirements and masters seed selection techniques. Yanshi County has planned to have one seed selection core member for every ten mu of wheat field and one seed selection technician for every thirty mu. The selection criteria emphasize large ears, main ears, uniform growth, disease resistance, and lodging resistance. Eight "don'ts" are implemented (don't take ears from field edges, roadsides, lodged areas, diseased areas, overly tall or short areas, or ears with small or loosely arranged grains), ensuring separate harvesting, threshing, drying, and storage. Currently, existing warehouses are being inspected, cleaned, and disinfected. (Zhang Lizhong)
    This Dispatch from Nanjing, May 15th – People's communes in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, are organizing the masses to go deep into the fields and determine over ten thousand mu of seed fields for summer-ripening crops through methods of observation, discussion, and determination, and assigning dedicated personnel to manage this work. At the beginning of determining seed retention fields, a few cadres and the masses believed that most of the varieties this year are good varieties, and it does not matter whether they are retained or not. The current production task is very tight, and the seed selection work only needs to be picked when the wheat is on the market. According to the above ideological situation, the party committees of each commune separately convened symposiums of branch secretaries, technicians and farmers in the management area, and discussed the importance of the word "seed" in the "Eight-Character Constitution." Fengyu Commune handed over the work of keeping seeds to the members for extensive discussion, so that everyone unanimously realized the importance of keeping good seeds. Varieties such as Yuanmai "Yangzhong Red" and wheat "2419", although they are excellent varieties, from the wheat that has already been eared, there is still a 10% degree of mixing. If a thorough fine selection is not carried out, it will inevitably make the excellent varieties mixed and affect the yield of summer-ripening crops next year. On the basis of unifying thinking and raising awareness, the work of determining seed fields was quickly launched. The whole commune has determined 1,256 mu of Yuanmai seed fields and 385 mu of wheat "2419" and "Caizi Huang" seed fields on more than 17,000 mu of high and low fields, and more than 5,000 mu of green manure seed fields. In the work of selecting seed retention fields, the various societies and teams have high requirements, pay attention to quality, and immediately strengthen management. The Yuan and wheat seed fields determined by the New Rising Management Area of the Happiness Commune are generally wheat fields with high terrain, not easy to waterlog, not easy to get sick, and no diseased wheat. The wheat plants grow balanced, get up early, have thick stalks, large ears, more than 40 grains per ear, full grains, and few hybrids. This management area has also determined 112 people, including farmers, technicians, and activists with experience in seed work, to be responsible for the seed fields, from field management to wheat entering the warehouse, with people assigned to fields, responsible for contracting to the end. During harvesting, seed fields should be picked, placed, transported, beaten, and stored separately. The production team and the members also signed a "five guarantees" contract to reasonably determine work-point remuneration. Because the responsibilities are clear, special personnel observe the growth changes every day, record them every day, in order to take measures and prescribe the right medicine. (Gu Ping)

    河南省布置小麦选种工作
    江苏扬中县确定种子田一万多亩
    本报郑州15日电　河南省的小麦即将成熟，为了给今后丰收打下良好基础，河南省农业厅最近召开专、市农业局局长、农业科学研究所长会议。要求对今年小麦选种工作要抓早、抓好，培育发现新品种，提高原有优良品种，使良种普遍提高一步。
    今年小麦选种工作，在贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”后的新形势下提出新的任务，小麦地普遍比过去耕的深，种的密、肥料比过去上的多，管理的细致，并搞了不少的大面积丰产方，这些变化，对种籽的要求也有了相应的提高。根据这些变化，把过去没有被重视的抗倒伏、高产耐肥的“中农二八”、“辉县红”要在今后大量发展，过去已经发展的品质好、高产、又抗倒伏的“南大二四一九”继续发展，过去已大量推广的适应性强但不抗倒伏的“碧玛一号”控制在原有数量上。同时还要淘汰一些不大好的“佛手麦”、“土二芒麦”等。会上，还提出今后要做到优良品种普及化，良种繁育系统化、优良品种多样化，良种保管制度化。
    今年的小麦选种工作时间紧、任务大，各地为了很好的完成这一任务，从省到人民公社确定都要建立选种机构，抽调专职干部，各生产队成立选种专业队，层层包干，开展品种站队，并把农业科学部门、试验场的技术员、土专家组成一批队伍，分片包干，掌握重点，全面系统地收集资料，作好选种规划。实行包地块、包品种、包专业队和定时间、定任务、定质量、定选种工分。
    在有了专业队伍的情况下，各地还必须放手发动群众，开展群众性的选种工作，做好技术训练，使人人懂得选种育种的要求，熟练地掌握选种技术。偃师县已作出计划，十亩麦田有一个选种骨干，三十亩麦田有一个选种技术员。选种要大穗、主穗、生长整齐、抗病、抗倒伏的穗。实行八不要（地头穗不要、路边、倒伏、病虫、过高、过低、小穗、排列松的穗都不要），作到单打、单收、单晒、单保管。当前，要求把现有仓房进行一次检修、清仓、消毒工作。　　（张励中）
    本报南京15日电　江苏扬中县各人民公社组织群众深入田头，用边看、边议、边定的办法，确定了夏熟作物的种子田一万多亩，并确定专人管理这项工作。在开始确定留种田时，少数干部群众认为今年大部分都是良种，留不留无所谓，当前生产任务十分紧张，选种工作只要在麦子上场时，拣拣就行了。根据以上的思想情况，各公社党委分别召开了管理区的支部书记、技术员和农民座谈会，讨论了“八字宪法”中的“种”字的重要性。丰裕公社把留种工作交给社员广泛讨论，使大家一致认识留好种子的重要性。元麦“扬中红”、小麦“二四一九”等品种，虽为优良品种，但从已经抽穗的麦子来看，仍有10％的混杂程度，如不彻底精选一次，势必使优良品种混杂，影响明年夏熟作物的产量。在统一思想、提高认识的基础上，迅速地开展了确定种子田的工作。全公社一万七千多亩高低田，已确定元麦种子田一千二百五十六亩，小麦“二四一九”、“菜子黄”种子田三百八十五亩，绿肥种子田五千多亩。在选择留种田工作中，各社队要求很高，讲究质量，并随即加强管理。幸福公社新升管理区确定的元、小麦种子田，一般都是地势高、不易涝、不易病、无病麦的麦田，麦株生长平衡，起身早，秸秆粗，穗头大，每穗四十粒以上，子粒饱满，杂种少。这个管理区并确定对种子工作有经验的农民、技术员和积极分子等一百十二人为种子田的负责人，从田间管理到麦子进仓，以人定田，负责包干到底。在收割时，种子田要单摘、单放、单运、单打、单保管。生产队与社员还签订了“五保证”的合同，合理地确定了工分报酬。由于责任明确，每天都有专人观察生长变化情况，天天记载，以便采取措施，对症下药。　　　（古平）
