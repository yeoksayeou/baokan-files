Hunan Launches Mass Movement to Attack High Sulfur from Inside and Outside Furnaces with Layered Defenses
Hubei Promotes Advanced Experience, Strengthens Technical Transformation and Management of Small Blast Furnaces
Leading Cadres of Anhui Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company Go Deep into Workshops and Furnaces to Vigorously Implement Nine Major Measures

(Our Dispatch from Changsha, May 25) Hunan Province is focusing on the metallurgical technology of small blast furnaces and improving technical management systems. In the first half of May, the average daily output of pig iron in the province reached 1,304 tons, of which 1,000 tons were of good quality pig iron.

At the beginning of May, in order to improve the quality and yield of pig iron, various regions in Hunan Province focused on organizing workers to learn technology, promoting advanced experience, and strengthening technical management. In terms of organizing workers to learn technology, various regions adopted methods such as running training classes, holding technical research meetings, signing apprenticeship contracts, and visiting other factories, enabling many workers to master smelting operation technology in a short period of time.

In terms of promoting advanced experience, most iron factories in the province promoted the use of multi-nozzle low-level combustion in hot blast stoves, the use of quicklime instead of limestone, and the use of surplus gas from small blast furnaces as fuel for power equipment. Currently, 66% of small blast furnaces in the province use the multi-nozzle combustion method in hot blast stoves, generally increasing wind temperature from over 400 degrees to over 600 degrees. 33% of small blast furnaces use quicklime instead of limestone, and the surplus gas from 47 small blast furnaces is being utilized, saving a lot of fuel. Due to the timely adoption of these measures, the output and quality of many iron factories have rapidly improved. A 6-cubic-meter small blast furnace in the Xiatang Yun Iron Factory in Shaoyang adopted a series of advanced experiences such as using quicklime instead of limestone in early May. As a result, not only did the daily output increase from 1.76 tons to 4.05 tons, but the sulfur content also decreased from 0.2% to 0.06%, all of which was qualified foundry pig iron.

In terms of technical management, iron factories in various regions have established a series of systems to ensure the quality of pig iron. Limin Iron Factory in Chaling County established a complete set of quality inspection systems, adopted technical measures such as desulfurization inside and outside the furnace, and promoted the "one-stop" mineral processing method. From mining workers, transportation workers, sand compression workers, to charging workers, everyone participated and selected ore at every level. This reduced impurities in the ore and greatly improved the ore grade. The factory also established a "segmented sampling, furnace-numbered" inspection system. Three samples are taken from each furnace of iron water, and the samples are numbered according to the furnace. After the laboratory comes to a conclusion, workers can take measures furnace by furnace according to the test results to ensure the quality of pig iron. The refined iron is also divided into eight categories and marked accordingly. Products that do not meet the specifications are not allowed to leave the factory. The factory's employees are now working hard to achieve all qualified iron. At the same time, half of the iron factories in the province have established machinery maintenance and product acceptance systems, which have promoted the improvement of pig iron quality.

(Our Dispatch from Wuhan, May 25) In the first half of May, the quality and output of steel and iron in Hubei Province increased significantly. The average daily output of steel reached 1,330 tons, an increase of 14.46% compared to late April, and the average daily output of pig iron was 2,358 tons, an increase of 28% compared to late April. The average qualified rate of steel reached 90.54%, and the average qualified rate of pig iron reached 94.05%.

Strengthening the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, promoting the experience of advanced furnaces, and mobilizing the masses to engage in technical management are important reasons for the continuous and steady increase in steel output and quality in these units. For example, the steel factory of Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 adopted the operation method of both high wind and high temperature and increased coke load. After the blower was connected in parallel, the air volume increased from 30 cubic meters per minute to 56 cubic meters; the hot air pressure increased from 90 mm of mercury column to 115 mm of mercury column; the wind temperature increased from 520 degrees Celsius to 620 degrees Celsius, so the output increased linearly. In early May, the utilization coefficient averaged 1.562, and the average daily iron production was 12.495 tons, an increase of 2.16 tons compared with the average in April. The small blast furnace of Daye Iron Mine implemented multi-nozzle combustion and further improved the hot blast stove, which increased the wind temperature from 450 degrees Celsius to 700 degrees Celsius, and the output increased from 8.9 tons to 11 tons. In order to improve the quality of coke, Huangshi Coking Plant also changed single-trough coal washing to double-trough coal washing, reducing coke ash from 20% to 14.29%; coal washing efficiency increased from 2 tons per person per day to 4 tons.

Various enterprises and units have also strengthened the management of production technology, established shift battleground meetings and handover systems, production command responsibility systems, raw material and finished product inspection and acceptance systems, and so on.

(Our Dispatch from Hefei, May 25) Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company vigorously implemented nine major measures, and the quality and output of pig iron have increased significantly since May. The qualified rate of quality reached over 91%; the daily output of pig iron has been stable at over 2,000 tons. As of the 24th, the plant had completed 83.6% of its monthly plan.

The nine major measures of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company to improve the quality and output of pig iron are: (1) fixed materials, reserve ore. It is required to reserve half a month's worth of materials, and make every effort to improve the iron content of the ore; (2) increase the output and quality of sintered ore, requiring the iron content of sintered ore to reach 50%, and the daily output to reach 1,400 tons to 1,600 tons; (3) use quicklime instead of limestone as a calcining agent. Strive for half of the blast furnaces to use quicklime in May; (4) improve coke quality and reduce coke ratio. Requiring the coke ratio of large blast furnaces to gradually decrease to 0.95 in May, and small blast furnaces to decrease to 1.1; (5) increase wind temperature and increase air volume. The wind temperature of large blast furnaces should gradually increase to over 800 degrees Celsius in May, and to 900 degrees in June, and the wind temperature of small blast furnaces should be stable at around 500 degrees; (6) improve operating technology and charging systems, and implement unified operations for three shifts; (7) cadres go down to the furnace side and work with the shifts; (8) trial implementation of output quotas to furnaces, with bonus for exceeding quotas; (9) establish a technical research group and a raw material transfer group to concentrate efforts to solve blast furnace production and transportation problems.

In order to resolutely implement these measures, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company appointed two deputy managers to specifically lead pig iron production, and assigned them to serve as the heads of the technical research group and the raw material transfer group respectively; the factory directors and party committee secretaries of each factory have gone down to the workshops and furnace sides to supervise the blast furnaces to implement unified operations for three shifts, use high wind temperature and large air volume, and so on. Currently, the average wind temperature has increased from over 600 degrees Celsius in the past to over 700 degrees. The production quality and output of various raw materials have been continuously improved, and the ash content of local coke quality has been reduced from 23% to 20%. (Attached picture)

    安徽马鞍山钢铁公司领导干部深入车间炉旁狠抓九大措施
    本报长沙25日电  湖南省大抓小高炉的冶炼技术和健全技术管理制度，5月份上半月全省生铁平均日产量达到一千三百零四吨，其中有一千吨是质量较好的洋铁。
    5月初，湖南省各地为了使生铁优质高产，着重抓紧组织工人学习技术，推广先进经验和加强技术管理的工作。在组织工人学习技术方面，各地采取办训练班、开技术研究会、订师徒合同、到外厂参观等办法，使许多工人在短时期内掌握了冶炼操作技术。
    在推广先进经验方面，全省大部分铁厂推广了用热风炉多嘴低位燃烧法，用生石灰代替石灰石、利用小高炉剩余煤气作为动力设备的燃料等先进经验。目前全省小高炉中，已有66％采用热风炉多嘴燃烧法，风温一般都由四百多度提高到六百多度，有33％的小高炉利用生石灰代替石灰石，还有四十七座小高炉的剩余煤气被利用起来，节省很多燃料。由于及时采取这些措施，很多铁厂的产量和质量迅速提高。邵阳下塘云铁厂一座六立方公尺的小高炉，5月上旬采用生石灰代替石灰石等一系列先进经验以后，不仅日产量由一点七六吨提高到四点零五吨，而且含硫量也由原来的0.2％降低到0.06％，全部为合格铸造生铁。
    在技术管理方面，各地铁厂建立了一系列的制度，以保证生铁质量。茶陵县利民铁厂建立了一套完整的质量检验制度，又采取炉外炉内脱硫等技术措施，还推行了“一条龙”的选矿方法，从采矿工、运输工、压砂工、直到加料工，人人动手，层层选矿。这样，使矿石中杂质减少，大大提高了矿石的品位。这个厂还建立了“分段取样，按炉编号”的检验制度，每炉铁水取出三个样品，样品都按炉编号，等化验室得出结论后，工人们就可根据化验结果，再逐炉采取措施，保证了生铁质量。炼出的铁，也分成八类，作好标志，不合规格就不准出厂。这个厂的职工现在正为争取全部达到合格铁而努力。同时，全省有一半的铁厂建立了机器维修与产品验收等制度，对提高生铁质量起了促进作用。
    本报武汉25日电  湖北省5月上半月钢、铁的质量、产量显著提高。钢的平均日产量达到一千三百三十吨，比4月下旬增长14.46％，生铁平均日产二千三百五十八吨，比4月下旬增长28％。钢的合格率平均达到90.54％，生铁的合格率平均达到94.05％。
    加强对小高炉的技术改造、推广先进炉的经验、发动群众大搞技术管理，是这些单位钢铁产量、质量不断稳步上升的重要原因。如武汉国棉一厂钢铁厂采取了大风高温与提高焦炭负荷的双管齐下的操作方法，和鼓风机并联以后，风量由每分钟三十立方公尺提高到五十六立方公尺；热风压力由九十公厘水银柱增加到一百一十五公厘水银柱；风温由摄氏五百二十度提高到六百二十度，因而产量直线上升。五月上旬利用系数平均达到一点五六二，平均日产铁十二点四九五吨，比4月份平均提高二点一六吨。大冶铁矿的小高炉，实行了多嘴燃烧，进一步改进了热风炉之后，使风温由摄氏四百五十度提高到七百度，产量由八点九吨增至十一吨。为了提高焦炭质量，黄石炼焦厂还改单槽洗煤为双槽洗煤，焦炭灰分从20％降低到14.29％；洗煤工效由每人每天二吨提高到四吨。
    各企业单位还加强了对生产技术的管理，建立轮班战地会议和交接班制度、生产指挥责任制度、原料与成品的检验和验收制度等等。
    本报合肥25日电  马鞍山钢铁公司狠抓九大措施，5月份以来生铁的质量产量显著提高，质量合格率达91％以上；生铁日产量稳定在二千多吨以上。到24日止，全厂已完成月计划的83.6％。
    马鞍山钢铁公司提高生铁质量产量的九大措施是：（1）固定用料，储备矿石。要求储备半月的用料，并尽最大努力提高矿石含铁量；（2）提高烧结矿的产量、质量，要求烧结矿含铁量达到50％，日产量达到一千四百吨到一千六百吨；（3）用生石灰代替石灰石做焙剂。争取5月内有半数高炉使用生石灰；（4）改进焦炭质量，降低焦比。要求大高炉焦比在5月内逐渐下降到零点九五，小高炉降低到一点一；（5）提高风温，加大风量。大高炉风温在5月内逐渐提升到摄氏八百度以上，6月提升到九百度，小高炉稳定在五百度左右；（6）改进操作技术和装料制度，实行三班统一操作；（7）干部下到炉旁，跟班劳动；（8）试行定产到炉，超额奖励制度；（9）成立技术研究小组、原料调运小组，集中力量解决高炉生产和运输问题。
    为了坚决贯彻这些措施，马鞍山钢铁公司指派了两名副经理专门领导生铁生产工作，并分工担任技术研究小组和原料调运小组长；各厂的厂长和党委书记已下到车间、炉旁，督促高炉实行三班统一操作，使用高风温大风量等。目前平均风温，已由过去摄氏六百多度提高到七百多度。各种原料生产质量产量不断提高，土焦质量灰分由23％降低到20％。（附图片）
