Some Experiences in Combining Scientific Research and Production
Zhang潤蒼, Deputy Director of the Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Painful Memories: A Thunderbolt of Shock and Awakening

The Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences went through a period of detouring from theory and reality in the two years of 1956 and 1957. The lessons were painful and profound. At that time, some researchers emphasized the so-called "special nature" of research work, refused to solve the major problems urgently needed in national construction, were unwilling to contact factories and mines, and were only willing to carry out "theoretical" research behind closed doors, pursuing "creative" achievements away from reality. Because they lost the clear goal of serving socialist construction, their research work became like a blind man riding a blind horse, unable to produce results for a long time. Even if some results were produced, they could not serve socialist construction in a way that met practical needs. For example, in 1956 and 1957, the Institute of Applied Chemistry carried out a total of one hundred and nineteen research projects, but only ten were promoted to industrial departments and factories and mines. Among them, except for one with major shortcomings that was unsuitable for application and needed to be improved, the remaining nine were topics left over from before 1955. Contact with industrial departments was even scarcer, and cases of industrial departments being turned away when they came for help were not uncommon. This led the Institute of Applied Chemistry into a bleak and detached situation. Facing this situation, how could many scientists not be shocked? This prompted great changes in the thinking of the researchers. Some progressive researchers realized that this situation was not right and began to seek ways to get rid of it. Most researchers felt that this approach was not appropriate, but they were used to it and could not find a proper solution, so they showed hesitation, hesitation, and confusion. In the calls for finding direction, other researchers insisted on continuing according to the original approach, hoping to develop themselves in the direction of "chemists" detached from reality, but the young researchers around them became increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo, making them increasingly isolated. In short, during this period, the Institute of Applied Chemistry's change of existing research directions and the demand for seeking correct research directions had a strong sense of impending change. At this moment, the wise Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao launched the great rectification movement, and then put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This thunderously awakened the illusions of some researchers at the Institute of Applied Chemistry, pointed out the correct path for the thinking of some researchers who were in turmoil, found the correct direction of closely combining scientific research with socialist construction, and set off a vigorous great leap forward in scientific research at the Institute of Applied Chemistry.

Ways to Combine Research Work with Production and Construction

The primary prerequisite for closely combining scientific research with production and construction is to understand the current situation of national production and construction and find the correct and specific direction for research work. In order to understand the current situation of national production and construction, the Institute of Applied Chemistry sent scientific researchers to relevant industrial departments and the factories and mines they led to make contact and conduct on-the-spot investigations and research work. After returning to the institute, they comprehensively considered the current situation of national production and construction and, in accordance with the responsibilities that research institutes under the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should have, determined research topics. This has better changed the erroneous situation of building cars behind closed doors. Because contact with relevant departments has been established, and research work has been combined with production and construction, the bleak situation of the past has been changed, and it has become a vigorous and magnificent momentum. The comparison between the past and the present will of course make people feel infinitely excited and moved. In addition to conducting investigations and research in industrial departments, we have also achieved the combination of research work and production and construction through the following ways: (1) Establish relationships with industrial departments and promote research results. Some of these research results are research projects determined based on the utilization and exploitation of a certain important material resource of the country and a certain task required by a certain department. After the research work has achieved affirmative results, it is promoted to relevant departments, such as the separation and analysis of rare elements. Some are research results that were promoted to a certain department or factory and mine based on national decisions, such as the promotion of butadiene-pyridine rubber and the research results of making styrene from butadiene. (2) Cooperate with production departments to jointly complete a major research task. The collaboration method generally takes the form of a relay race: Party A coarsely prepares, Party B purely prepares; Party A purely prepares raw materials, and Party B prepares metals. Research work in the field of rare elements is carried out in this way. (3) Train cadres for industrial departments or send researchers to factories and mines. This can both understand the production situation, learn production knowledge, and personally impart theoretical and technical knowledge. (4) Go to factories in industrial departments to conduct intermediate-type experiments. Many research results obtained in the laboratory are a certain distance from production, that is, an intermediate-type experiment is still needed. If the relevant factory has the conditions for intermediate testing, the Institute of Applied Chemistry will send people to the relevant factory for intermediate testing. In this way, the factory can understand and familiarize itself with the situation from the beginning of the intermediate test, so as to avoid starting from scratch when mass production is carried out. Their construction of an intermediate factory can also alleviate the difficulties of insufficient manpower and material resources in the research institute. (5) The Institute of Applied Chemistry runs its own intermediate factories. At present, some work cannot find intermediate testing sites in China. At the same time, due to the national Great Leap Forward, there are many materials and medicines that are needed in all aspects but cannot be purchased in China. This also puts forward production tasks for us. Therefore, based on the existing manpower, material resources and other conditions, and on the basis of running intermediate factories in the past, the Institute of Applied Chemistry has established a considerable number of intermediate factories since the second half of 1958, which has a greater role in rapidly promoting research results and closely combining research work with production and construction.

Through the above channels, almost none of the research topics done by the Institute of Applied Chemistry has no contact and relationship with industrial departments.

Here, a problem needs to be explained. When it comes to combining research work with production and construction, some people mistakenly believe that only practical tasks are done, not theoretical research, only research on current work, not research on future work. We believe that the above understanding is not appropriate enough. Of course, when the scientific research work of industrial departments has not been carried out on a large scale, some practical tasks should still be done by the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences, otherwise the country's production and construction and research work will be out of touch, and the problems occurring in production and construction cannot be solved in time. However, when the research institutes of industrial departments can do these tasks, we should quickly hand these tasks over to them to do in-depth research on tasks; even when conducting research work on practical tasks, we should find out the key problems from the research on tasks, or conduct theoretical research by synthesizing data. It is precisely because research tasks are raised to the theoretical level for research that new problems that will inevitably arise in production can be solved, and production can be better promoted to reflect the combination of scientific research and production and construction. As for the research work on practical tasks and the research work on the future, there should also be an appropriate arrangement. Some research tasks related to current work should be done, and research tasks that are not directly related to current work or even do not seem to have much connection but are useful for future work should not be shortsighted and abandoned. The problem is that the current and future arrangements should seek a more correct ratio, so that they can both promote the current production and construction work and take care of the future, so that the correct combination of scientific research and production and construction can be reflected.

The Benefits of Combining Research Work with Production and Construction

After nearly a year of practice in combining research work with production and construction, we have realized that it has many benefits: First, it specifically implements the policy of combining theory with practice put forward by the Party Central Committee and is a powerful weapon for overthrowing dogmatism. In the process of carrying out work, it can help break the narrow departmentalism of researchers and improve the researchers' national and overall concepts towards the socialist motherland. Research institutions and researchers face the country's production and construction, and after learning about the country's production and construction situation, they can determine the direction and research topics in a well-informed manner according to the actual situation of the country's production and construction. At the same time, the problems arising in reality constantly remind researchers that in the process of selecting research methods and conducting research work, they need to consider problems from the perspective of production at all times. For example, when the Institute of Applied Chemistry was conducting research on butadiene-pyridine rubber in the laboratory, the researchers thought that the freezing, decompression, and fractionation equipment under several atmospheres were very common things and did not matter. But when they went to a fraternal chemical company for intermediate testing, they saw the equipment situation of the factory and realized that the addition of the above equipment should be paid attention to. This helps scientific researchers break the dogmatic thinking of only starting from books and not from China's reality when observing problems, and break the departmentalist thinking of only starting from the laboratory and not from the situation of the entire country when considering problems, so that scientific researchers truly realize the true and important significance of combining theory with practice.

Second, the combination of scientific research and production and construction can play a role in promoting each other. In the process of cooperation with industrial departments or in the process of intermediate testing, new products will be provided to industrial departments, production methods will be improved, and production processes will be shortened. In the process of testing and producing new products, the skills of technical personnel can be cultivated and improved, which is a promotion for national production and construction. At the same time, we should also see that, conversely, production and construction also have a great role in promoting scientific research work. In order to promote research results in a timely manner, scientific research work needs to be carried out with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, that is, research results should be made faster and more perfect, otherwise there will be no promotion of research results. In the process of cooperation and experimental promotion, new problems will be discovered to enrich the research content. For example, when the Institute of Applied Chemistry was conducting rare earth separation research in the laboratory, it did not pay attention to the separation of a small amount of cerium in a large amount of rare earth metals at all, and this type of problem could not be found in the literature either. But this problem was raised during the intermediate test, which provided new content for the research work. In addition, some medicines and materials that cannot be produced in China in general can also be produced for research work during the intermediate test, which saves foreign exchange and provides reliable material guarantees for research work, promoting scientific research work.

Cost accounting is not easy to calculate accurately when working in the laboratory, but it is a problem that should be put forward for accurate calculation first when conducting larger-scale experimental production.

Third, it is conducive to cultivating cadres and technicians. When researchers work in factories, they not only conduct labor exercises, but also increase a lot of practical knowledge. For example, when the Institute of Applied Chemistry established an intermediate factory, it used both local and foreign methods and adopted a large number of substitutes. We once replaced stainless steel pots or stainless steel tanks with large ceramic jars, replaced large filter plates with large funnels, and replaced flowmeters with gas meters... The solution of these specific problems and the increase of practical knowledge are of great help to cultivating scientific research cadres who are both practical and theoretical, and both red and expert. In terms of cultivating technical strength, a group of military comrades who were newly demobilized to the Institute of Applied Chemistry have been able to operate independently after a short period of training and exercise because they participated in the work of the intermediate factory. In addition, it has also cultivated a group of technical forces for industrial departments, which has played a certain role in strengthening the scientific team.

Fourth, in terms of materials and equipment, they can also help each other and share what they have, saving national expenditures. Research institutions use the factory's existing equipment for intermediate testing, and factories use the research institution's precision analysis instruments for cost accounting and other production designs, which is beneficial to both parties' work and can avoid purchasing some idle equipment, saving a lot of expenses for the country.

Several Problems

The benefits of combining scientific research and production and construction are many, but it does not mean that there are no problems at all. We believe that the following problems still need to be studied:

1. Strengthening Cooperation. Under the premise of the country as a whole, the cooperation between scientific research institutions and production departments needs to be more prepared and more systematic in order to better avoid defects such as dealing with things on a case-by-case basis, failing to complete the tasks stipulated in the agreement on schedule, and failing to implement the agreement in an orderly manner, so as to create a broader path for combining scientific research and production and construction. At the same time, with the growth and improvement of the research strength of industrial departments, the division of labor and cooperation between the research institutions of industrial departments and the research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also need to be organized more reasonably.

2. The Scale and Management of Intermediate Factories. We believe that the principle of running intermediate factories should be: it should not only play the role of intermediate testing, but also not involve too much research strength on a large scale; it should not only produce a certain number of products, so that the intermediate factory does not become a purely consuming place, but also should not reverse the role of the host and turn the research institute into a factory; it should not only take care of the needs of current work, but also take care of the development of future work. However, we have only run intermediate factories for a short time, and as for how large the factory scale should be, we still need to solve it in future practice. In addition, with the start of the factory's operation, a series of factory management problems such as cost accounting and organization management have also arisen. These problems need to be explored and solved one by one for research institutions that are unfamiliar with managing factories.

Although there are the above problems, we believe that they are small problems in the Great Leap Forward. We have the confidence to cooperate and develop work with relevant departments, create experience for the combination of scientific research work and production and construction, ensure that the scientific research tasks undertaken by the Institute of Applied Chemistry continue to leap forward, and ensure that scientific research work better serves socialist construction.

    科学研究工作和生产相结合的点滴体会
    中国科学院应用化学研究所副所长　张润苍
    痛心的记忆霹雳似的震惊和猛醒
    中国科学院应用化学研究所在1956年和1957年两年中间，曾经走过一段理论脱离实际的弯路。教训是沉痛的，深刻的。那时，有些研究人员强调研究工作的所谓“特殊性”，拒绝解决国家建设中急待解决的重大问题，不愿意和厂矿进行联系，只愿意关起门来进行“理论性”的研究，脱离实际地追求“创造性”的成果。由于失去了为社会主义建设服务这一明确的目标，就形成了研究工作的盲人瞎马，长时间做不出工作成果来；即便做出一些工作成果，也不能起到适应实际需要的为社会主义建设服务的作用。例如，1956年和1957年两年内，应用化学研究所共进行了一百一十九项研究，而向产业部门和厂矿推广的却只有十项，其中除了一项缺点较大，不适合应用须待改进外，其余九项都是1955年以前留下来的题目。至于和产业部门的联系更是寥寥无几，产业部门登门求助遭受拒绝者却屡见不鲜，这就使应用化学研究所陷入了冷冷清清的脱离实际的局面。面对这种状况，许多科学家岂能不怵目惊心？这就促使研究人员们的思想起了很大的变化。有些进步的研究人员觉察到这种状况不对头，开始谋求摆脱这种状况的道路；大部分研究人员虽则感觉到那种做法不够合适，但却习以为常，又找不出妥善的办法，因而表现犹豫、踌躇、徬徨；在所谓找方向的呼声里面，另外一些研究人员则坚持按原有的做法做下去，希望自己向着脱离实际的“化学家”的方向发展，但他们周围的青年研究人员却对现状日益不满，使他们日益陷于孤立状态。总之，这一时期的应用化学研究所对现存研究方向的变更、对谋求正确的研究方向的要求，大有山雨欲来风满楼的气势。就在这时，英明的中国共产党中央委员会和毛主席发起了伟大的整风运动，接着又提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，这就霹雳似地震醒了应用化学研究所某些研究人员的迷梦，给正在动荡中的一些研究人员的思想指出了正确的道路，找到了紧密地结合社会主义建设进行科学研究的正确方向，掀起了应用化学研究所轰轰烈烈的科学研究工作的大跃进。
    研究工作与生产建设相结合的途径
    紧密地结合生产建设进行科学研究工作的首要前提就是要了解国家生产建设的现有状况，找出研究工作正确的具体方向。为着了解国家生产建设的现有状况，应用化学研究所曾派出科学研究人员到有关的产业部门和他们领导的厂矿进行联系，进行实地的调查研究工作，回所以后，综合国家现有的生产建设状况，再按照中国科学院领导的研究所应有的职责，定出研究题目，这就较好地改变了闭门造车的谬误状况。由于和有关部门的联系打通了，研究工作和生产建设结合起来了，也就改变了从前那种冷冷清清的局面，进而成为轰轰烈烈的雄壮气势，今昔对比，当然会使人无限兴奋和激动。除向产业部门进行调查研究以外，我们还通过以下途径做到研究工作和生产建设相结合：（一）和产业部门建立关系，推广研究成果。这些研究成果有的是根据国家某一项重要物质资源的利用和开采以及某部门需要的某项任务而确定的研究项目，到研究工作取得肯定的成果以后，即向有关部门进行推广，如稀有元素的分离分析就是这样；有的是研究工作取得成果以后，才根据国家的决定到某一部门或厂矿推广的，如丁吡橡胶和从丁二烯做苯乙烯的研究结果就是这样推广的。（二）和生产部门进行协作共同完成一项重大的研究任务。协作方式一般的是采取接力赛跑的形式：甲方粗制，乙方纯制；甲方纯制原料，乙方制备金属。如稀有元素方面的研究工作就是这样协作进行的。（三）为产业部门培养训练干部或派研究人员到厂矿去。这就可以一方面了解生产状况，学习生产知识，一方面亲自动手传授理论、技术知识。（四）到产业部门的工厂去进行中间型的试验。许多研究工作在研究室得出的成果和进行生产是有一段距离的，就是说还需要进行一段中间型试验。如果有关工厂有中间试验的条件时，应用化学研究所即派人到有关工厂进行中间试验。这样，厂方可以从中间试验开始就了解熟悉情况，免得到大规模生产时再从头摸索起；他们筹建了中间工厂，也能够减轻研究所人力物力不足的困难。（五）应用化学研究所自办中间工厂。目前有些工作在国内还找不到中间试验场所，同时由于全国大跃进，各方面需要而又在国内购买不到的材料、药品很多，这也向我们提出了生产任务，因此应用化学研究所根据现有的人力、物力等条件，并在过去办中间工厂的基础上，从1958年下半年到现在为止，已经办起了一定数量的较为可观的中间工厂，这对于迅速推广研究成果，对于研究工作和生产建设的密切结合都是有较大的作用的。
    通过以上各条途径，应用化学研究所所做的一切研究题目几乎没有一个是和产业部门没有联系和关系的。
    在这里，需要说明一个问题。就是一提起研究工作和生产建设相结合，有的人就误解为只做现实任务、不做理论研究，只做有关目前工作的研究，不做有关将来工作的研究。我们认为上述认识是不够妥当的。固然在产业部门的科学研究工作还没有大量开展的时候，有些现实任务科学院的研究所还是应该做的，否则就会使国家的生产建设和研究工作脱节而不能及时解决生产建设中发生的问题。但是，当产业部门的研究所能做这些工作时，我们就应当很快地把这些工作交给他们而去做深入一步的任务研究；即便是进行现实任务的研究工作的时候，也应当从任务的研究中找出关键性的问题，或是综合资料进行理论研究工作。正因为把研究任务提高到理论上来进行研究，才能解决生产中必然会出现的新问题，促进生产更好地体现科学研究和生产建设相结合。至于有关现实任务的研究工作和有关将来的研究工作，也应当有个适当的安排。有关目前工作的一些研究任务是应当做的，对于那些和目前工作不能直接联系或甚至看不出有多大联系，但对将来工作却有作用的研究任务也不能表现近视而放弃不做。问题是目前的和将来的安排要谋求一个较为正确的比例，要既能推动目前的生产建设工作，又能照顾到将来，这样才能够体现出科学研究和生产建设的正确结合。
    研究工作和生产建设相结合的好处
    经过近一年来研究工作和生产建设相结合的实践，我们体会到它好处很多：第一，它具体地贯彻了党中央所提出的理论联系实际的方针，是打倒教条主义的有力武器；在进行工作过程中，能够帮助打破研究人员狭隘的本位主义思想，提高研究人员对待社会主义祖国的国家观念和整体观念。研究机关和研究人员面向国家生产建设，了解到国家的生产建设情况以后，就能够心中有数地按照国家生产建设的实际情况确定方向和研究题目；同时，现实中产生的问题也不断地提醒研究人员在选择研究方法和进行研究工作的过程中，都需要时时刻刻从生产着眼来考虑问题。如应用化学研究所在实验室研究丁吡橡胶时，研究人员认为几个气压下的冷冻、减压、分馏设备是很普通的东西，算不了什么，但到兄弟化学公司进行中间试验时，看到工厂的装备情况，认识到增添上述设备却应当引起注意。这就帮助科学研究人员在观察问题时打破只从书本出发、不从中国的现实情况出发去考虑问题的教条主义思想，打破只从研究室出发、不从整个国家的情况出发去考虑问题的本位主义思想，使科学研究人员切实地体会到理论联系实际的真实的重要意义。
    第二，科学研究工作和生产建设相结合，能够起到使科学研究和生产建设相互促进的作用。在和产业部门的协作过程或是在中间试验过程中都会给产业部门提供新的产品，改进生产方法和缩短生产过程，在试验和生产新产品的过程中，能培养和提高技术人员的技能，这对国家生产建设是一个促进。同时我们也应该看到，反过来生产建设也对科学研究工作有很大的促进作用，为着及时推广研究成果就需要多快好省地进行科学研究工作，就是说要更快更完善地做出研究成果来，不然就谈不上什么研究成果的推广问题，在协作和试验推广过程中，又会发现新的问题丰富研究内容。如应用化学研究所在实验室进行希土分离研究工作时，根本没有注意大量希土金属中少量铈的分离问题，在文献上也查不出这一类的问题，但在中间试验时这一问题却被提出来了，这就为研究工作提供了新的内容。另外，在中间试验时也可以为研究工作生产一些国内一般不能生产的药品、材料，既节省了外汇，也给研究工作提供了可靠的物质保证，促进了科学研究工作。
    成本核算问题，在研究室进行工作时很不容易精确地计算出来，到进行较大型的试验生产时却是应该首先被提出作精确计算的一个问题。
    第三，有利于培养干部和技术人员。研究人员在工厂劳动时，既进行了劳动锻炼，也增加了很多实际知识，如应用化学研究所在建立中间工厂时，使用土洋并举的方法，采用了大量的代用品。我们曾经以大陶瓷缸代替不锈钢锅或不锈钢槽，以大漏斗代替大滤板，以煤气表代替流量计……，这些具体问题的解决和实际知识的增加，对培养既有实际知识又有理论知识的又红又专的科学研究干部有很大的帮助。在培养技术力量方面，新复员到应用化学研究所的一批军人同志，由于参加了中间工厂的工作，经过短时期的培养和锻炼，已经能够独立操作。此外还为产业部门培养了一批技术力量，对于壮大科学队伍起了一定的作用。
    第四，在物资器材方面也可以互助互利，互通有无，节省国家开支。研究机关使用工厂的现成设备进行中间试验，工厂使用研究机关的精密分析仪器等进行成本核算等生产设计，对双方工作有利，又可避免购买一些闲置器材，为国家节省了大量的开支。
    几个问题
    科学研究和生产建设相结合的好处是很多的，但并不是说一点问题也没有了，我们认为，还存在着以下问题需要加以研究：
    一、加强协作问题。在全国一盘棋的前提下，科学研究机关和生产部门的合作还需要更加有准备更加系统化，才能更好地避免就事论事、不能按期完成协定所规定的任务和不能有次序地实现协定等缺陷，给科学研究和生产建设相结合创造更广阔的道路。同时随着产业部门研究力量的成长和提高，产业部门研究机构和中国科学院研究单位的分工和协作也需要组织得更为合理。
    二、中间工厂的规模和管理问题。我们觉得办中间工厂的原则应当是：既要能起到中间试验的作用，又不能范围过大牵扯过多的研究力量；既要生产出一定数量的产品，不使中间工厂成为单纯消耗的场所，又不应反宾为主把研究所变成了工厂；既要照顾到目前工作的需要，又要照顾到将来工作的开展。但我们办中间工厂的时间很短，至于工厂规模到底多大为好，还需要在将来的实践中去解决。另外，随着工厂的开始运转，也产生了成本核算、组织管理等一系列的工厂管理问题，这些问题对管理工厂表现陌生的研究机构来说都是需要一一摸索解决的。
    虽然存在着上述问题，我们认为那是大跃进当中的小问题，我们有信心同有关部门进行协作和开辟工作，为科学研究工作和生产建设相结合创造出经验来，保证应用化学研究所担负的科学研究任务继续大跃进，保证科学研究工作更好地为社会主义建设服务。
