    Jiangxi Harvests Rapeseed
    In Yichun, Fuzhou, Shangrao, and other major rapeseed-producing areas of Jiangxi, rapeseed has now been mostly harvested and brought to the threshing floor. In areas south of the Gan River, where maturity is earlier, approximately 300,000 mu of rapeseed has been harvested and preparations for threshing have begun.
    Jiangxi Province is one of the main rapeseed-producing areas in China. Last year, rapeseed was widely planted in more than 80 counties in mountainous and plain areas throughout the province, with a planting area of over 3 million mu.

    Inner Mongolia Plants Large Quantities of Livestock Feed
    To change the situation of solely relying on natural grasslands for grazing livestock, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plans to plant 11 million mu of feed crops this year to establish a strong artificial feed base.
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region planted more than 2.2 million mu of feed crops last year, nearly half of which were managed by people's communes in pastoral areas. Due to the bumper harvest of feed crops, livestock throughout the region safely survived the winter last year and are growing well.

    Fujian Begins Harvesting Wheat and Barley
    1.56 million mu of wheat and barley in Fujian Province are ripening from south to north. Southern Fujian, where the season is earlier, has entered the busy harvest season, with frequent good news of bumper harvests everywhere.
    To ensure a good wheat harvest, production brigades and production teams in various localities, under the unified leadership of the people's communes, are rationally arranging labor and universally organizing temporary harvesting teams to "harvest each field as it ripens."
