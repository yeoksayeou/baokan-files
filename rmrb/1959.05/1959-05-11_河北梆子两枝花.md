    Two Flowers of Hebei Bangzi
    Lin Yu

    Xun Guan Niang (Performed by the Little Hundred Flowers Troupe of the Tianjin Hebei Bangzi Theater)

    Hebei Bangzi, an ancient opera genre, has blossomed with vibrant new flowers in Tianjin in recent years, one of which is the Little Hundred Flowers Troupe. This troupe is composed entirely of young actors in their teens and twenties. I had heard of them long ago but had never seen them perform. This time, passing through Tianjin, I saw their performance of "Xun Guan Niang," and it was indeed well-deserved reputation, which was very gratifying.

    Their plays are attractive not only because the actors are energetic and have unlimited potential, nor just because they perform to a certain level, but more importantly because their performances show that the ancient Hebei Bangzi genre has gained new life and welcomes the audience with a new look.

    "Xun Guan Niang" is a historical drama, but it is full of a new spirit. The author sings the praises of young people with great enthusiasm. After praising Xun Guan Niang's courage and knowledge, and her ability to accomplish earth-shattering things at a young age, the author uses the voices of all the actors on stage to sing the praise of "heroes are born from among the youth." Of course, the enthusiasm for this praise does not only come from the ancient characters, but from the high-spirited young people who are doing even more earth-shattering great deeds on various fronts. This is a completely modern emotion.

    In order to express this emotion, Hebei Bangzi has appeared in a new posture. First, there have been reforms in the singing style, which has enabled Bangzi's expressive power not only to be on the side of generosity and grief, but also to develop the lively and cheerful side. Because of this multifaceted performance, it highlights the two aspects of Xun Guan Niang's life, as a little girl at home and disguised as a man to ask for reinforcements. This change in music, in order to adapt to the changes in the character's emotions, is necessary. Without this change, it would not be possible to express this character. This improvement in the Bangzi tune is a kind of progress. Without this progress, it would be difficult to express new characters and new emotions. Of course, I don't understand Bangzi music very well. Could the changes here be better and more closely related to the tradition? Perhaps this is still possible. But this is a problem of not enough experience in artistic creation, not a question of whether the approach is right or wrong.

    The fresh feeling of course comes not only from the content of the script and the reform of the singing style, but also from the performance of the young actors. Although the young actors are still quite immature, they belong to the new era. Every move, every raise of the eyebrow, every blink of an eye, naturally reveals the breath of life of modern people, which is different from the previous generation. This is not contrived, but brought from life. Therefore, it is particularly impressive.

    As far as the play is concerned, there are also some shortcomings that can be greatly processed and improved. There are still some problems with the script in terms of compactness. The first and second scenes have no action, and only introduce the characters, which seems to be too much. At the beginning of the fourth scene, Xun Guan Niang's life has undergone great changes. The city has been besieged, her brother has died in battle, and her mother has died of illness. Her father is frowning, so she is determined to break through the siege to ask for reinforcements. But these things that prompted her to make a major decision did not let the audience see in advance how it stimulated her, causing her mood to undergo a major change, but suddenly confessed from her solo singing, which did not impress the audience very deeply, and it was not easy for the audience to understand the natural order of this decision in emotion, so they could not experience the ups and downs and struggles in emotion with the characters in the play. If this scene is placed after the fifth scene, and she sees her father's worries and troubles with her own eyes, thus arousing her determination, this scene will be "padded" up. The eighth scene of encountering a tiger on the road is dispensable, and it is also monotonous for an actor to perform all the time. Besides, the young actors are too tired. The ninth scene of Tao Kan's trick is a good scene. Xun Guan Niang comes to ask for reinforcements, and Du Zeng comes to bribe to prevent the rescue. Tao Kan uses a little trick to make the reinforcements successful. More ink should be spent to embellish it, making it an absorbing scene. This may deepen the conflict of the play, and each character will have room to play, and the play will be more rich and colorful.

    Du Shi Niang (Performed by the Hebei Province Leap Forward Troupe)

    This troupe is also a new flower in Hebei Bangzi, and it is also composed of young actors. It is said that in the inheritance and development of Hebei Bangzi, Tianjin has established two opposing aspects, that is, the Little Hundred Flowers Troupe and the Leap Forward Troupe. I have seen the plays of these two troupes, and they do have different styles, and they are also consciously moving towards their respective goals. Roughly speaking, the "Little Hundred Flowers" has more ideas and practices in terms of innovation and creation, while the "Leap Forward" pays more attention to inheriting and learning from tradition.

    It is said that the "Leap Forward" has many good plays, but unfortunately I only saw "Du Shi Niang," which is only the "Returning Boat and Abandoning Treasures" section. But even this section is amazing. The actor is just a young actor in her early twenties who has only been learning opera for five years. Her teacher, Jia Guilan, has taken a fancy to this apprentice and passed on her proud work to her.

    Watching this play is indeed an enjoyment. It is rare for an actor of this young age to understand the character's emotions so deeply. She almost grabs people as soon as she appears on the stage, and immediately reveals that atmosphere from her figure and lines, making people feel that she has experienced many ups and downs in life, and knows very well about feelings and cherishes feelings. Li Jia's sinister intentions were not revealed to Du Shi Niang by himself, but were guessed by her very sensitively. This point is well written in the script, and the actor's understanding is also very deep. She very appropriately expresses that on the one hand, she deeply believes in Li Jia, and on the other hand, she is very sensitive to the fact that her origin is the real reason for Li Jia's distress this time. "You think I am a burden!" One sentence exposes Li Jia's thoughts. But after hearing Li Jia's straightforward confession that he has sold her, she does not believe it, saying that it is just his drunken words. These places depict a person's mood in a very penetrating way.

    Everything is confirmed, she can't hold on, she forces herself to calm down and let Li Jia go to sleep. She thinks about it and can't find a way out. She once thought that if she told Li Jia about the treasure box and solved the contradiction between him and his family, then he would not just be a greedy person who loves a thousand taels of silver. Wouldn't a happy love life still be maintained? Just as she was full of hope to lift the curtain and call Li Jia, the dream talk of "a thousand taels of silver" came from the curtain. She felt a chill all over her body, froze, and then gradually tasted it: "He will still sell me after he spends all the treasure box!" This time she was completely desperate, singing in a very gloomy tone the words that she had never been truly loved by anyone in her life, and that she had no home after death, and she was determined to commit suicide, and to commit suicide in the form of protest.

    After making the decision, her mood became calm, and she began to dress up. She put on flowers in front of the mirror. Seeing the flowers and herself in the mirror, she no longer had the strength to raise her hand to put them on. She threw away the flowers and sobbed on the table, but she immediately cheered up, put on the flowers, and looked at herself in the mirror reluctantly, just like Chen Bailu in "Sunrise" saying to the mirror "How young, how beautiful," although there was not a word. After a while, she helplessly put the mirror back on the table with her weak hands, determined to say goodbye to her appearance.

    At this point, the playwright and the actors were still not willing to let go. Li Jia was called up by Du Shi Niang, and was very surprised to see her dressed so beautifully. At this time, Du Shi Niang's hope burned again, saying, Aren't I about to leave? Are you just playing such a big joke on me in your drunkenness, making me suffer all night? Li Jia said, If you didn't mention it, I would have forgotten about it. With just this sentence, her hope was extinguished again.

    The play after that is not good, it is loose, but that is the problem of the script, the actor's performance is still good, with passion. This young actor is called Li Shumin, and she has a very lyrical singing voice and a pair of expressive hands. Her shortcoming is that she is not very good at using her eyes, and often stares too wide. But she is still a promising actor with good qualities. According to people who have seen her teacher's play, she performs more delicately and lyrically than her teacher, and she is better than her teacher. From this point, it can also be seen that although this troupe pays great attention to inheritance, it is also developing tradition in different ways.

    河北梆子两枝花
    林羽
    荀灌娘（天津河北梆子剧院小百花剧团演出）
    河北梆子这个古老的剧种，近年来在天津却开出了鲜艳的新花，其中之一就是小百花剧团。这个剧团都是由十几二十岁的青年演员所组成。我是早已闻名而没有见面，这次路过天津看到了他们演出的“荀灌娘”，的确名不虚传，令人十分欣喜。
    他们的戏之所以吸引人，不只是因为演员都是虎虎有生气，前途不可限量的青年人，也不只是因为他们演得的确有一定的水平，更重要的是从他们的演出里看出了河北梆子这个古老剧种又获得新的生命，用一种新的面貌来迎接观众。
    “荀灌娘”是一个历史戏，但充满了一种新的精神，作者以充沛的热情来歌颂青年人，他在表扬了荀灌娘的有胆有识，以小小年纪而办出了惊天动地的大事之后，借全台演员之口唱出了“英雄本是少年人”这样的赞词。当然，这种赞颂的热情之所以来，决不只是由于古代的人物所引起，而是由于现在各个战线上干着更为惊天动地的伟大事业的意气风发的青年人所引起的。这是一种十足现代的感情。
    为了表现这种感情，河北梆子就出现了新的姿态。首先在唱腔上有所改革，它使得梆子的表现力不止于是慷慨悲歌的一面，也发展了活泼轻快的一面。由于这种多方面的表现，就烘托出了荀灌娘生活的两方面，在家做小女儿的一面和男装去请救兵的一面。这种音乐上的变化，为了适应人物感情的变化，是必要的，如果没有这种变化，就不能表现这个人物。梆子腔调的这种改进是一种进步，没有这种进步就难于表现出新人物、新感情。当然，我不太懂梆子音乐，这里的变化是否还可以更好一些，更加和传统联系得紧一些呢？也许是还有这种可能的。但这是艺术创作上经验还不多的问题，而不是一个做法对不对的问题了。
    新鲜感觉的产生当然不只来自剧本的内容和唱腔的改革两方面，年轻的演员的表演也是重要的因素之一。年轻演员虽还相当不成熟，但他们是属于新时代的人物，一举一动，一抬眉一瞬目，自然流露出与前一辈人不同的现代人的生活气息，这不是做作出来的，而是生活中带来的。因此它也就特别给人深刻的印象。
    就戏而论，也存在一些缺点，还可以大大加工改进。在编剧上还有不紧凑的毛病，第一、二场没有戏，只是介绍人物，似乎笔墨费得太多。第四场一开始荀灌娘的生活已经起了很大的变化，城已被围，哥哥战死，母亲病死。父亲愁眉不展，她因此决心突围出城去请救兵。但这些促使她作重大决定的事情没有在事先让观众看见如何给了她以刺激，使她的心情起了重大变化，而是突然从她的独唱中间表白出来，这给观众的印象就不太深，不容易让观众体会这个决定在感情上的自然顺序，因而也不能与剧中人一同经历感情上的起伏和斗争。如果这场戏放在第五场之后，亲眼见到父亲的愁烦苦恼，因而激起她的决心，这戏就“垫”起来了第八场路上遇虎是可有可无的戏，而且老是一个演员表演也单调一些，再说，年轻的演员也太累。第九场陶侃施计是场好戏，荀灌娘这边来求救兵，杜增那边来行贿阻止救援，陶侃从中略施小计使得增援成功，应当多费点笔墨加以点染，使它成为一场引人入胜的戏。这样可能使戏的矛盾深入，而且各个角色都有发挥的余地，戏就会更加丰富多采些。
    杜十娘（河北省跃进剧团演出）
    这个剧团也是河北梆子中间的一朵新花，也是由年轻演员组成的。听人说，在河北梆子的继承与发展方面，天津已经树立了对立面，那就是小百花剧团和这个跃进剧团。这两个剧团的戏我都看了，确有不同的风格，而且还是比较有意识地朝着各自的目标前进的。大致说来，“小百花”在革新、创造方面有更多想法和做法，而“跃进”却更注意继承与学习传统方面。
    据说“跃进”有许多好戏，可惜我只看到了“杜十娘”一出，这又只是其中“归舟撇宝”一段。但就是这一段，已经使人惊叹不止。演员只不过是一个刚学了五年戏的二十出头的青年演员，她的师父贾桂兰看中了这个徒弟，把自己这出得意之作传给了她。
    看这出戏的确是一种享受。年纪这样轻的演员体会角色的感情这样深，真是少见。她几乎是一出场就把人给抓住了，立刻从她的身段和台词里流露出那种气氛，让人觉得她是经过了许多生活的波澜，非常懂得感情和珍惜感情的人物。李甲心里的鬼胎不是由他自己向杜十娘说破的，而是由她非常敏感地猜测出来的。这一点，剧本也写得好，而演员的体会也很深。她很恰当地表现出来一方面深信李甲一方面又非常敏感到自己的出身是李甲这次苦闷的真因。“你觉得我是一个累赘！”一句话就把李甲的心事给戳穿了。但听到李甲直率的表白说已经把她卖了之后，她却反而不相信起来，说这只是他的醉话。这些地方刻划一个人的心情是入木三分的。
    一切都证实了，她支持不住，强自镇定让李甲去睡了，自己前思后想没有出路，曾也想如果把百宝箱的事告诉李甲，解决了他与家庭的矛盾，那他也还不是仅仅爱一千两银子的贪财之辈，岂不幸福的爱情生活仍可保持吗？正当她充满希望要揭帐子喊李甲的时候，帐子里却传出了“一千两银子”的梦话，她周身打了一个冷战，怔住了，然后逐渐回味过来：“他把这百宝箱花完，还是要卖我的！”这下子完全绝望了，用一种非常阴沉的调子唱出自己一生从来没有被人真正疼爱，死后也没有归宿的词来，并且决心自杀，而且要用抗议的形式来自杀。
    作了决定，心情反而平静了，开始梳装起来。她对着镜子戴花，看到镜子里的花和自己，再也没有力量抬手去戴，丢开花，伏在桌上抽咽了，但随即又振作起来，戴好花，恋恋不舍地向镜子里端详着，就仿佛“日出”中间陈白露对着镜子说“多么年轻，多么美”的那种心情，虽然并没有一句话。好一会才无可奈何地用无力的双手把镜子复在桌上，决心和自己的容颜决别了。
    到了这一步，剧作者和演员还不肯放松。李甲被杜十娘叫起来了，看见她打扮得如此美丽，很感到诧异。在这时候，杜十娘的希望又燃烧起来了说，不是我就要走了吗？难道你在醉后给我开这样大的玩笑，使我苦恼了一整夜吗？李甲说，不是你提起，我倒忘怀了。只这一句，又重新把她的希望浇灭了。
    以后的戏就不好了，松了，但那是剧本的问题，演员的表演仍然是好的，有激情的。这个年轻的演员叫李淑敏，有非常抒情的歌喉和一双富于表情的手。她的缺点是还不大会运用眼睛，常常瞪得太大。但她不失为一个有希望的好素质的演员，据看过她师父这出戏的人说，她比师父演得更细腻、更抒情，是青出于蓝的。从这点也可看出这个剧团虽很注意继承，却也在不同的方式上发展着传统。
