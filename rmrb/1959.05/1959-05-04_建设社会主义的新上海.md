Comrade Representative Cao Diqiu's Speech:

    Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion is China's Internal Affair, and No Foreign Interference is Allowed

    The ten million people of Shanghai completely support the Central Government's wise measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet and safeguard the unity of the motherland, and unanimously oppose the expansionist elements in India's conspiracy to meddle in our territory.

    Tibet is our territory. It is China's internal affair to quell the rebellion and exercise our sovereignty in our own territory, and no foreign interference is allowed. Imperialists are taking advantage of the Tibetan incident to clamor and stir up trouble, and Indian expansionists are also openly supporting the Tibetan rebellion, hypocritically sympathizing with the Tibetan people. Do they really sympathize with the Tibetan people? No, it's a deception. They hide ulterior motives under the guise of "sympathy" for the Tibetan people. However, the fox's tail cannot be hidden after all. Recently, Indian Socialist Party leader Narayan frankly revealed the ambitions of the Indian expansionists. He said, "According to the old agreement between the British and the Chinese, the latter has suzerainty over Tibet, while the former enjoys the monopoly right to develop that country." He also said that after Tibet's "independence," "India becomes the successor to this monopoly right." From this, we see that the real intention of the Indian expansionists' so-called "sympathy for the Tibetan people" is to inherit the mantle of British aggression in Tibet and "enjoy the monopoly right over Tibet." It is not difficult to associate this with a series of facts. Why did Kalimpong become the base for rebel activities abroad? Why did Indian officials distribute the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement"? Why are the words and deeds of Indian interventionists so similar to those of the imperialists? The reason is very simple: Narayan is most honest because Indian interventionists style themselves as heirs to British imperialism, and of course they speak in the language of British imperialism. They say that "China's suzerainty over Tibet is an expired suzerainty" and that "Tibet is an independent country." These arguments are like the Tibetan proverb: "Putting a sheep's head on a horse's body - turning black into white." Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This is a historical fact formed over hundreds of years. Who can deny it? Who can cover the sky with one hand? We want to solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian interventionists: the Chinese people who have stood up will never allow anyone to meddle in our sacred territory or infringe upon our sovereignty. Anyone who dares to meddle in our territory or infringe upon our sovereignty will be met with a bloody nose before the great Chinese people. The Chinese people love peace, but we are by no means weak and欺负able. We sincerely wish to continue to develop and consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples and adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. However, we will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs.

    The people of Shanghai are very concerned about the people of Tibet. We cheer for the passing of the backward, dark, and cruel old Tibet, and we doubly cheer for Tibet's embarkation on the bright road of democracy and socialism!

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and I agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    Premier Zhou's report comprehensively summarizes the great achievements and experiences of the First Five-Year Plan period and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan - 1958, and proposes a magnificent plan for continued leap forward in 1959. Judging from Shanghai's situation, Premier Zhou's report is completely in line with the actual situation and is completely correct.

    Shanghai is one of China's largest industrial bases. Over the past ten years, the industrial landscape has undergone fundamental changes, and the technical level has also greatly improved. These achievements are unprecedented in the history of Shanghai's industrial development over the past 100 years, clearing obstacles and laying the foundation for the construction of a new socialist Shanghai.

    Ten years ago, Chairman Mao told us: "Within three to five years, our economic cause can be completely restored, and within ten to eight years, our economy can be greatly developed." The development of events has fully confirmed Chairman Mao's prediction. Shanghai is one of China's largest industrial bases. When Shanghai was just liberated ten years ago, the total annual industrial output value was only 3.09 billion yuan. After a three-year recovery period, by 1952, the total industrial output value increased to 5.99 billion, an increase of 93.7%, which was already a great achievement at that time. On this basis, after the First Five-Year Plan period, while basically completing the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, Shanghai's socialist construction also achieved great victories. The total industrial output value in 1957 was 11.43 billion yuan, an increase of 268.5% compared to 1949, and an increase of 90.3% compared to 1952. The proportion of heavy, light, and textile industries also changed from 13.6%, 24%, and 62.4% respectively in 1949 to 36.5%, 26.9%, and 36.6%, fundamentally changing the entire industrial landscape of Shanghai and greatly improving the technical level. There is no doubt that these achievements are unprecedented in the history of Shanghai's industrial development over the past 100 years. It has cleared obstacles and laid a preliminary foundation for the construction of our new socialist Shanghai. However, the great social productive forces liberated by the victory of our socialist revolution and the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system were more fully demonstrated in the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In 1958, Shanghai's total industrial output value was 17.13 billion yuan, an increase of 50.2% over the previous year, 185.8% over 1952, and 453.5% over 1949. The increased output value in that year was 5.33 billion yuan, exceeding the total output value of the entire year of 1949, equivalent to the total increase in output value during the First Five-Year Plan period. The increase in many important products exceeded any previous year. Shanghai's steel production in 1958 was 1.22 million tons, while it was 5,000 tons in 1949, only equivalent to one day's production in the fourth quarter of 1958. Shanghai's production of metal cutting machine tools was 690 in 1949 and 12,720 in 1958 (excluding simple machine tools). Taking the textile industry, which accounted for more than half of the total industrial output value in the early days of Shanghai's liberation, as another example, 712,000 bales of cotton yarn and 640 million meters of cotton cloth were produced in 1949, while 1,982,000 bales and 1.44 billion meters were produced in 1958, both more than doubled. I think, without giving more figures, we can already see how far Shanghai's industrial front has advanced in 1958. Is there a more appropriate word to describe it than "Great Leap Forward"?

    Last year's Great Leap Forward was not only reflected in the rapid growth of material wealth, but also in the profound changes in people's spiritual outlook. The revolutionary enthusiasm and unwavering revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai workers and working people are very touching. The progress of all strata of people in Shanghai is also very obvious. These changes in people's spiritual outlook have greatly promoted the vigorous development of our various undertakings.

    Last year, the development speed of Shanghai on all fronts was not the fastest in the country. Judging from the past years, the absolute number of Shanghai's industrial production has been increasing year by year, but its proportion in the country has been decreasing. For example, Shanghai's total industrial and handicraft output value accounted for 23.8% of the country's total industrial and handicraft output value in 1949 (29.9% excluding handicrafts), decreased to 19% in 1952, decreased to 16.5% in 1957, and decreased to 14.6% in 1958. This is a great thing, because it is an eloquent symbol that our country is getting better year by year. We are all very happy to see this change. We hope and believe that this change will continue to occur in the future. One day, although Shanghai's total industrial output value will increase many, many times compared with today, it will only account for a few percentage points or even less in the country. By then, our great motherland will not only completely change the face of "poverty and blankness" but will also have hundreds and thousands of new modern industrial bases, truly realizing Chairman Mao Zedong's battle call to our people delivered from this solemn platform in the opening address of the First Session of the First National People's Congress: "Within several five-year plans, we will build our current economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture." "We will build our country into a great socialist republic."

    The achievements of the First Five-Year Plan and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan not only show that the socialist system has unparalleled youthful vitality, but more importantly and more greatly, we have begun to find a better way for our country to build socialism, which is the general line of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, formulated according to the creations of the people: to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Our victory is the victory of the Party's general line, the victory of the 650 million people of the country fighting heroically under the guidance of the general line, and the victory of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and our great leader Chairman Mao.

    Fellow representatives, fellow committee members: The achievements we have made are great, but in the eyes of the great Chinese people, it is only the starting point of a new battle. The 1959 national economic plan, centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, is a plan for continued Great Leap Forward.

    Shanghai's industrial production task in 1959 is equivalent to more than four times the total output value of 1952. Completing the state plan is the highest interest of the Shanghai people and the responsibility that the Shanghai people must fulfill. We must do our best to complete it.

    According to the tasks assigned to Shanghai by the state plan, Shanghai's total industrial output value in 1959 is estimated to be 24.8 billion yuan, an increase of about 45% over the previous year, equivalent to more than four times the industrial output value of 1952. That is to say, Shanghai in 1959 is equivalent to four Shanghais in 1952. Completing the state plan is the highest interest of the Shanghai people and the responsibility that the Shanghai people must fulfill. We must do our best to complete the tasks assigned to Shanghai by the state plan, and we must strive to overfulfill them. What method should we use to complete this glorious task? The most important thing is to launch a large-scale mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy. We must boldly mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technological revolution, and without increasing the number of workers, increase Shanghai's industrial labor productivity by 40% or more this year compared with last year. That is to say, one worker in Shanghai this year should be equivalent to one and a half workers last year.

    Experience has proved that when formulating plans, we must consider both favorable conditions and anticipate various difficulties on the road to the Great Leap Forward. At present, we are encountering difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and insufficient equipment capacity. In the future, there will be some difficulties that are difficult to predict today. Insufficient raw materials and equipment capacity are not bad things. It shows that we are continuing to make a Great Leap Forward, and that new contradictions are emerging in the Great Leap Forward. We know that under our incomparably superior social system, social productive forces are always developing non-stop, and people's living standards are always rising accordingly. Then, expanding reproduction is not only possible but also necessary. To expand reproduction, it will always cause contradictions with the incompatibility of raw materials, equipment capacity, and labor force. Our production cause will continue to advance in the process of solving such contradictions. It is inevitable to encounter difficulties on the road to the Great Leap Forward. It is unimaginable if there are no difficulties. The question is what attitude we take towards difficulties. Today, many of the difficulties facing us can be solved without much effort, many must be overcome through great efforts, and only a very few cannot be solved for the time being. Therefore, as long as we are not afraid of difficulties and use a positive attitude to rely on the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties, this year's Great Leap Forward will definitely be realized. Whoever bows down in the face of difficulties, does not rely on the strength of the masses, and underestimates subjective initiative, will make many difficulties that could have been overcome through efforts fail to be overcome. This will inevitably hinder the realization of the leap forward plan.

    In the process of completing the state plan in Shanghai in the first quarter of this year, many difficulties were encountered. The most serious was the shortage of raw materials. However, these difficulties were finally basically resolved with the joint efforts of the vast number of cadres, workers, and technicians, and the victory of the industrial output value in the first quarter increased by 70.2% over the same period last year was achieved.

    The experience on the industrial production front in the first quarter of this year, not only the same as the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, but also more profoundly proves that the first step in boldly mobilizing the masses lies in whether the leadership truly does a good job of explaining the situation to the masses. The leadership of industrial enterprises must use a method of communicating from top to bottom, explaining the situation, tasks, plans, and difficulties to the masses clearly. Through the democratic forms of great airing, great blooming, big-character posters, and great debates, and the method of calculating detailed accounts together from top to bottom, after exposing the contradictions in all aspects, calculate the gap between production tasks and raw material supply, equipment capacity, and labor force, and propose specific measures and specific methods to solve the gap and difficulties, focusing on overcoming the main contradictions. Each workshop, section, production team, and individual also formulated their own specific guarantee plans with the overall leap forward plan of the factory as the guideline. Wherever this is done, the formulated plans are both more advanced and more practical. Some workers said it well: the more you calculate, the clearer the situation becomes, the more you calculate, the more methods there are, and the more you calculate, the more enthusiastic you become.

    The central content of boldly mobilizing the masses is to vigorously carry out technological revolution and technological innovation, which is the inevitable trend of the development of the mass movement. After calculating the gap, proposing measures, and formulating guarantees, skillful work has become an urgent need for the masses. This year, the momentum of technological revolution and technological innovation is greater than last year, the scope is wider, and the content is richer. Not only are many large factories making a lot of noise, but small factories are also making a lot of noise; not only are veteran workers taking the lead, but young workers are also unstoppable, and many technicians are also enthusiastically going down to the workshops to discuss experiments with workers. In a short period of three months, the achievements of technological revolution and technological innovation are not small. Some places that originally felt that there were insufficient working hours and insufficient equipment were no longer worried. Chengfu Iron Factory, which produces 12-horsepower diesel engines and oil pumps and oil tips, put forward 3,100 suggestions in the first quarter, more than doubled the total number of suggestions last year, and 810 suggestions have been implemented; the labor productivity of production workers is 153% of the average of last year's quarters, and individual groups have reached the level of one worker being equivalent to four and a half people last year. Some places that originally lacked raw materials have also found ways to save and substitute. Due to the shortage of raw materials, the Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, which was almost completely shut down, has realized 99 of the 204 innovation projects through the efforts of its employees. They used hair, urine, and plant protein to successfully trial-produce 12 products such as cysteine, exceeding the quarterly plan stipulated by the state by 59.7%. As the workers said, "There is no waste gas in the sky, no waste material on the ground, and no waste liquid underground." They overcame difficulties and moved forward in such circumstances.

    The achievements we have made in the first quarter are very small compared with the annual task. However, it profoundly inspires us: the enthusiasm of the masses is endless, and the wisdom is bottomless. As long as we firmly believe in the masses in our thinking and are good at boldly mobilizing the masses in our work methods, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and realize this year's Great Leap Forward.

    In factories and enterprises, continuing to carry forward the spirit of rectification and insisting that leading cadres appear as ordinary workers, integrating with the masses, is an important key to organizing a high tide of production and realizing the Great Leap Forward.

    Based on our personal experience, the primary link in fully mobilizing the masses in factories and enterprises is to continue to carry forward the spirit of rectification, continue to implement politics in command, continue to insist that leading cadres appear as ordinary workers, and constantly improve the mutual relations of people in socialist labor and other joint activities, always maintain a democratic style of consulting with the masses when things happen, always adhere to the principle of handling contradictions among the people with persuasion, give the heart to the masses, and integrate with the masses. Wherever this is done conscientiously and seriously, it can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, give full play to the endless wisdom of the masses, overcome all difficulties, and realize the leap forward indicators. At present, cadres with such a style are growing up in batches, which is a guarantee for the prosperity of our country. However, things are developing, and people's thinking style and working methods must adapt to the changes in the situation. If politics is not in command, the original advanced may be transformed into backwardness. We must always strictly place ourselves under the supervision of the broad masses and strive to transform our subjective world. The advanced will be more advanced, and the backward may also be transformed into the advanced. Recently, a worker comrade from Shanghai Guomian No. 6 Factory wrote a big-character poster to a workshop director, asking him to remember: "The rectification movement is over, but the spirit of rectification must never be lost." These words are short but heartfelt, and they are worth pondering. At the same time, fully mobilizing the masses must be combined with centralized leadership. The Party's leadership is the leader of the mass movement. No matter when, the direction of the mass movement is always determined by the leader. This year's mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy must be and already is more extensive and more in-depth than last year. This makes it even more urgent for us to further strengthen the Party's leadership in industrial enterprises, further implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, and further give play to the organizational role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League. We must carry forward the effective experience of one wave pushing another last year. Within a year, according to the characteristics of different periods, we must put forward appropriate slogans and organize new production upsurges one after another rhythmically, creating a situation where the back waves push the front waves and the leap forward is followed by another leap forward.

    Fellow representatives, fellow committee members: Our meeting is a meeting of unity, a meeting of leap forward, and a meeting of victory. This meeting will adopt the Government Work Report and the National Economic Plan, the State Final Accounts and Budget, which will draw a magnificent picture for us. As long as we adhere to the Party's general line for socialist construction, use and carry forward the successful experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, and unite closely with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the national leaders we have elected, we will surely be able to leap forward and leap forward again!

    建设社会主义的新上海
    曹荻秋代表的发言各位代表、各位委员：
    平定西藏叛乱是我国的内政，决不容许外国干涉
    上海一千万人民完全拥护中央政府平定西藏地区叛乱，维护祖国统一的英明措施，一致反对印度扩张主义分子染指我国领土的阴谋。
    西藏是我国的领土，我国政府在自己的国土上平定叛乱，行使自己的主权，这是我国的内政，决不容许外国干涉。帝国主义者借西藏事件大肆叫嚣，兴风作浪，印度扩张主义者也公开支持西藏叛乱，假慈悲地同情西藏人民。他们真的同情西藏人民吗？不，这是骗人的。他们打着“同情”西藏人民的幌子，隐藏着不可告人的目的。但是，狐狸尾巴毕竟是藏不住的。最近印度社会党领袖纳拉扬亲口和盘托出了印度扩张主义者的野心。他说：“根据英国人和中国人之间的旧协定，后者拥有对西藏的宗主权，而前者享有发展那个国家的垄断权利。”又说什么在西藏“独立”之后，“印度成为这个垄断权利的继承者”。从这里，我们看到印度扩张主义者嘴里所说的“同情西藏人民”的真实意图，就是继承英国侵略西藏的衣钵，“享有对西藏的垄断权利”。不难使人联想起一连串事实。为什么噶伦堡成为叛乱分子在外国的活动基地？为什么印度官员散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”？为什么印度干涉者的言行，和帝国主义者的言行那样惟妙惟肖？原因很简单，纳拉扬说得最诚实也没有了，因为印度干涉者自命为英帝国主义的继承人，当然他们就用英帝国主义语言来说话了。说什么“中国对西藏的宗主权是已经失效的宗主权”，说什么“西藏是独立国家”。这些论调正如西藏谚语所说：“羊头安在马身上——颠倒黑白。”西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是几百年来的历史形成的事实，谁能否定得了呢！谁能一手遮天呢？我们要正告帝国主义和印度干涉者：已经站起来的中国人民，决不容许任何人染指我国的神圣领土，侵犯我国的主权，谁要敢于染指我国领土，侵犯我国主权，谁就要在伟大的中国人民面前碰得头破血流。中国人民热爱和平，但是，决不是软弱可欺的。我们衷心地愿意继续发展和巩固中印两国人民的友谊，坚持执行和平共处的五项原则。但是，我们决不容许别人干涉我国的内政。
    上海人民十分关怀西藏人民，我们为落后、黑暗、残酷的旧西藏行将过去而欢呼，我们为西藏踏上了民主和社会主义的光明大道而加倍欢呼！
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，同意李富春、李先念两位副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    周总理的报告全面地总结了第一个五年计划时期内和第二个五年计划的第一年——一九五八年的伟大成就和经验，提出了一九五九年继续跃进的宏伟规划。从上海的情况看来，周总理的报告是完全切合实际情况的，是完全正确的。
    上海是我国最大的工业基地之一，十年来工业面貌发生了根本变化，技术水平也有了很大提高，这些成就在上海一百多年来工业发展的历史上是空前的，为社会主义新上海的建设扫清了障碍，奠定了基础
    十年之前，毛主席曾经告诉我们：“在三年五年的时间内，我们的经济事业可以完全恢复，在十年八年的时间内，我们的经济就可以得到巨大的发展。”事情的发展完全证实了毛主席的预见。上海是我国最大的工业基地之一，当十年前上海刚刚解放的时候，全年的工业总产值不过是三十点九亿元。经过三年的恢复时期，到一九五二年，工业总产值增加到五十九点九亿，也就是增加了百分之九十三点七，这在当时已经是一个伟大的成就。在这个基础上，经过第一个五年计划时期，在基本上完成了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，上海的社会主义建设事业也取得了伟大的胜利。一九五七年的工业总产值是一百一十四点三亿元，比一九四九年增加百分之二百六十八点五，比一九五二年增加百分之九十点三。重、轻、纺织工业的比重，也从一九四九年各占百分之十三点六、百分之二十四、百分之六十二点四，变为百分之三十六点五、百分之二十六点九、百分之三十六点六，使整个上海工业面貌发生了根本性的变化，技术水平也有了很大的提高。毫无疑问，这些成就在上海一百年来工业发展的历史上是空前的。它为我们社会主义新上海的建设扫清了障碍，奠定了初步基础。但是，我们社会主义革命胜利所解放出来的伟大的社会生产力，我们社会主义制度的无比优越性，在一九五八年的大跃进中才更加充分显示出来。一九五八年上海工业总产值一百七十一点三亿元，比上年度增长百分之五十点二，比一九五二年增长百分之一百八十五点八，比一九四九年增长百分之四百五十三点五。这一年增加的产值就有五十三亿三千万元，超过了一九四九年全年的总产值，相当于第一个五年计划期间产值增加的总和。许多重要产品的增长，超过了以往任何一年。上海的钢产量，一九五八年是一百二十二万吨，而一九四九年是五千吨，只抵得上一九五八年第四季度一天的生产量。上海金属切削机床的产量一九四九年是六百九十台，一九五八年是一万二千七百二十台（不包括简易机床）。另拿上海解放初期占工业总产值一半以上的纺织工业来说，一九四九年产棉纱七十一点二万件，棉布六点四亿公尺，而一九五八年却是一百九十八点二万件，十四点四亿公尺，都增加一倍以上。我想，不必再举更多的数字，我们已经可以看出一九五八年上海的工业战线已经推进了多么远，除了以“大跃进”相称颂之外，还能找得出更恰当的字眼来形容它吗？
    去年的大跃进，不仅表现在物质财富的迅速增长上，而且还表现在人们精神面貌的深刻变化上。上海工人群众和劳动人民忘我劳动的革命热情和坚毅不拔的革命气概是十分感动人的。上海各阶层人民的进步也是很明显的。人们在精神面貌方面的这些变化大大促进了我们各项事业的蓬勃发展。
    去年上海在各个战线的发展速度就全国范围来说还不是最快的。从历年看来，上海工业生产的绝对数字是逐年上升的，但是，它在全国所占的比重则是下降了。例如，上海工业、手工业的总产值一九四九年占全国工业、手工业总产值的百分之二十三点八（不算手工业是百分之二十九点九），一九五二年下降到百分之十九，一九五七年下降到百分之十六点五，一九五八年下降到百分之十四点六。这是一件天大的好事，因为它是我们国家一年比一年好的雄辩的标志，我们都很高兴看到这种变化。我们希望并且相信：今后还会继续产生这种变化，总有一天，上海的工业总产值同今天来比虽是增长了许多许多倍，但是，就全国范围来说，它不过占百分之点几或者还要少些。到那时，我们伟大的祖国将不仅最彻底地改变了“一穷二白”的面貌，而且会出现成百成千的新的现代化的工业基地，真正实现了毛泽东主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中、在怀仁堂这个庄严的讲台上向我们全国人民发出的战斗号召：“在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”“将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义共和国。”
    第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划头一年的成就，它不仅显示出社会主义制度具有无比的青春活力，而更重要、更伟大的意义还在于：我们开始找到了我国建设社会主义的更好的方法，这即是我们党中央和毛主席根据人民群众的创造制定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。我们的胜利，就是党的总路线的胜利，就是全国六亿五千万人民在总路线的照耀下。英勇奋斗的胜利，就是党中央和我们伟大的领袖毛主席英明领导的胜利。
    各位代表，各位委员：我们已经取得的成就是伟大的，但是，在伟大的中国人民看来，它不过是新的战斗的起点。以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的一九五九年国民经济计划，就是一个继续大跃进的计划。
    一九五九年上海工业生产任务，相当一九五二年总产值的四倍多，完成国家计划是上海人民的最高利益，也是上海人民必须尽到的责任，我们要尽最大努力来完成
    根据国家计划赋予上海的各项任务，一九五九年上海工业总产值预计为二百四十八亿元，比上年增长百分之四十五左右，相当于一九五二年工业总产值的四倍多。也就是说，一九五九年的上海，要抵得上一九五二年的四个上海。完成国家计划是上海人民的最高利益，也是上海人民必须尽到的责任。我们一定要尽最大的努力完成国家计划分配给上海的任务，并且一定要力争超额完成。用什么方法来完成这个光荣任务呢？最主要的是开展一个规模巨大的增产节约的群众运动。要放手发动群众，大闹技术革命，在不增加工人的条件下，使今年上海工业劳动生产率比去年增长百分之四十或者更多一些，也就是说，要使今年上海的一个工人相当于去年的一个半工人。
    经验证明：我们在制订计划的时候，既要考虑到有利条件，又要预计到在大跃进道路上的各种困难。目前遇到的就有某些原材料不足、设备能力不足的困难，今后还会有一些今天难以预计的困难。某些原材料和设备能力不足，这并不是坏事，它正表明了我们在继续大跃进，表明了在大跃进中出现的新的矛盾。我们知道：在我们的无比优越的社会制度下，社会生产力总是不停顿地向前发展的，人民的生活水平也总是相应地不断上升的，那末，扩大再生产不但是可能的而且是必要的。要扩大再生产，就总会引起同原材料、设备能力以及劳动力的不相适应的矛盾。我们的生产事业也就将在解决这类矛盾的过程中不断前进。在大跃进的道路上遇到困难是难免的，没有困难那才是一件不可想像的事。问题在于我们对待困难采取什么态度。今天摆在我们面前的困难，有许多是并不需要作很大的努力就可解决的，有许多是必须经过极大的努力才能战胜的，一时还没有条件解决的只是极少数。因此，只要我们不怕困难，并且用积极的态度依靠群众的力量去克服困难，今年的大跃进就一定能够实现。谁如果在困难面前低头，不依靠群众的力量，低估了主观的能动性，那就会使许多本来经过努力可以克服的困难，也得不到克服。这势必会妨碍跃进计划的实现。
    在上海今年第一季度完成国家计划的过程中，是遇到许多困难的，最严重的是原材料供应不足。但是，这些困难，在广大干部、工人、技术人员的共同努力下，终于得到基本解决，取得了第一季度的工业产值比去年同期增长百分之七十点二的胜利。
    今年第一季度工业生产战线上的经验，不但同一九五八年大跃进经验一样，而且更为深刻地证明了放手发动群众的第一步，在于领导上是不是真正做到向群众交底。工业企业的领导必须用一竿子通到底的方式，将形势、任务、计划、困难，统统向群众交代清楚。通过大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的民主形式和上上下下一道来算细账的方法，在暴露出各方面的矛盾后，算出生产任务同原材料供应、设备能力以及劳动力之间的差距，以克服主要矛盾为中心，提出各项解决差距和困难的具体措施和具体办法。各车间、工段、生产小组到个人，也以全厂跃进计划为纲，订出自己的具体保证计划。凡是这样做的地方，制订的计划既是比较先进的，又是比较落实的。有的工人说得好：越算账，情况越清楚，越算账，办法就越多，越算账，干劲也越足。
    放手发动群众的中心内容是大闹技术革命和技术革新，这是群众运动发展的必然趋势。在算出差距、提出措施、订出保证之后，巧干就成为群众迫切的需要了。今年技术革命和技术革新的声势比去年更大，范围更广泛，内容也更加丰富。不但许多大厂闹得热热烈烈，小厂也同样闹得热热烈烈；不但老工人一马当先，青年工人也锐不可当，许多技术人员也热烈地下到车间，同工人商量试验。在短短的三个月时间内，技术革命和技术革新的成绩是不小的。有一些本来感到工时不足、设备不足的地方，也不发愁了。生产十二马力柴油机和油泵、油尖的诚孚铁工厂，在第一季度中，工人提出了三千一百条建议，比去年全年增加一倍多，已经实现了八百一十条；生产工人劳动生产率是去年分季平均数的百分之一百五十三，个别小组达到一个工人顶去年四个半人的水平。有一些本来缺乏原材料的地方，也找到节约代用的途径。由于原材料供应不足，几乎有全部停工危险的生物化学制药厂，经过职工的努力，二百零四项革新项目已经实现九十九项。他们用发毛、小便、植物蛋白质试制成功的半胱氨酸等十二种产品，超额完成国家规定的季度计划百分之五十九点七。真如工人说的：“天上无废气，地上无废料，地下无废液。”他们就在这样的情况下克服困难前进。
    我们在第一季度取得的成绩和全年任务相比又是很小的。但是，它深刻地启示我们：群众的干劲是无穷尽的，智慧是无底的。只要我们在思想上坚决相信群众，在工作方法上善于放手发动群众，就一定可以战胜困难，实现今年的大跃进。
    在工厂企业中，要继续发扬整风精神，坚持领导干部以普通劳动者姿态出现，同群众打成一片，是组织生产高潮、实现大跃进的重要关键
    根据我们的切身经验，在工厂企业中，充分发动群众的首要环节，是继续发扬整风的精神，继续贯彻政治挂帅，继续坚持领导干部以普通劳动者的姿态出现，不断地改进人们在社会主义劳动中以及其他共同活动中的相互关系，永远保持遇事同群众商量的民主作风，永远坚持以说服的方法处理人民内部矛盾的原则，把心交给群众，同群众打成一片。凡是切实认真做到这些的，就能充分的调动群众的积极性，发挥群众无穷无尽的智慧，排除万难，实现跃进指标。目前具有这样作风的干部正在一批一批地成长起来，这是我们国家繁荣兴旺的保证。但是，事物是发展的，人们的思想作风和工作方法必须适应形势的变化。如果政治不挂帅，原来先进的可能转化为落后。我们必须时刻把自己严格地放在广大群众的监督之下，努力改造自己的主观世界，先进的会更先进，落后的也可能转化为先进。最近上海国棉六厂的一位工人同志给一位车间主任写了一张大字报，要他记住：“整风运动结束了，整风的精神永远不能丢掉。”这句话，语短心长，值得我们深思。同时，充分发动群众又必须和集中领导相结合。党的领导是群众运动的龙头，无论什么时候，群众运动的方向总是由龙头来决定的。今年的增产节约的群众运动比起去年一定是而且已经是更为广泛、更为深入了，这就更加迫切需要我们进一步加强党在工业企业中的领导作用，进一步贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制，并且进一步发挥工会和团的组织作用。我们必须发扬去年一浪推一浪的行之有效的经验，在一年之内，根据不同时期的特点，提出适当的口号，一个接一个地有节奏地组织新的生产高潮，造成后浪推前浪、跃进再跃进的形势。
    各位代表，各位委员：我们的大会是一个团结的大会，跃进的大会，胜利的大会。这次会议将要通过政府工作报告和国民经济计划、国家决算和预算，这些就为我们画出了一幅宏伟的图景。只要我们坚持党的社会主义建设总路线，运用和发扬去年大跃进的成功经验，全国人民紧密地团结在一起，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在我们选出的国家领导人员的领导下，我们一定能够跃进、再跃进！
