Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 22nd. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today saying that in the name of all Korean people, the government of the Republic once again firmly condemns the Syngman Rhee clique's "immigration" conspiracy and strongly demands that the Syngman Rhee clique immediately cease this criminal act of betraying the interests of the nation.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again strongly demands that the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique send all the South Korean compatriots they want to forcibly exile to foreign countries to the northern part of the Republic, and demands that the South Korean authorities promptly send representatives to hold talks between representatives of the North and South Korean authorities at Panmunjom or other locations to practically resolve this issue.

The statement said that the government of the Republic issued a statement on January 22 this year, condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's conspiracy to forcibly move South Korean residents to Latin American countries, and demanded that all "immigrants" in South Korea, including the unemployed, retired soldiers of the Rhee army, and residents of northern Korea who were abducted to South Korea, be sent to northern Korea. However, the Syngman Rhee clique not only did not accept this suggestion based on brotherly love, but under the manipulation of US imperialism, continued to frantically push forward the "immigration" conspiracy. The statement said that the Syngman Rhee clique announced the "Overseas Immigration Committee Act" on May 11, putting its criminal "immigration" plan into practice.

The statement emphasized that the government of the Republic "cannot turn a blind eye" to this. "All Korean people will never allow the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique's heinous attempt to forcibly sell our compatriots to foreign capitalists and farm owners under the guise of 'immigration'."

The statement said that the northern part of the Republic has achieved unprecedented prosperity in all aspects, including economy and culture, "The people of the northern part of the Republic are eager to share the fruits of their hard work with their South Korean brothers, and are ready to receive all the unemployed, displaced farmers, and war orphans in South Korea who are groaning in misery, and guarantee them a stable life."

The statement said: "The government of the Republic suggests to the South Korean authorities that in order to tear down the artificial walls that prevent parents and brothers from seeing each other even though they are close by, and in order to enable all people in North and South Korea to travel freely, Panmunjom and Cheorwon, as well as other locations agreed upon by both parties, should first be designated as places for free travel." The statement said: "We open our doors to all who wish to travel freely at any time, and guarantee their personal safety and provide them with convenience."

The statement said: "Today, the root cause of the national division of the Korean people and the indescribable sorrow and pain suffered by the South Korean compatriots lies in the US imperialist occupation of South Korea. The US imperialists must get out of South Korea as soon as possible. The reactionary ruling system of the Syngman Rhee clique must be abolished, and Korea should achieve peaceful reunification by the Koreans themselves as soon as possible."

The statement said: "The tragic situation in South Korea makes the peaceful reunification of the motherland an urgent issue." The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "is ready to negotiate with the South Korean authorities," "As long as it is someone who stands up for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, no matter who they are, we will not hold their past against them and will join hands with them."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 21st. From the 17th to today, nearly 400,000 people in the capital cities of the northern provinces of Korea and Kaesong City have held rallies to protest and condemn the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique's so-called "immigration" conspiracy to sell South Koreans to foreign countries as slaves.

At a mass rally of 50,000 people held in Qingjin City today, Kim Chang-soo, a labor hero of the Kim Chaek Iron Works, said that the Korean people must smash the conspiracy of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to sell South Korean brothers to slave traders. He called on South Korean workers and all people to fight for the early expulsion of US troops from South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Qi Yuanji, the head of the Jiulong Agricultural Cooperative in Sariwon City, said at a mass rally in Sariwon City: We firmly demand that the US-Rhee group immediately stop this crime of trafficking in human beings, and demand that the South Korean compatriots who have been sold to foreign countries be sent to the warm embrace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

At these rallies, representatives of people from all walks of life in northern Korea unanimously angrily condemned this crime by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. The masses at the meeting shouted in unison: "Yankees get out of South Korea!"

    朝鲜政府声明欢迎南部受难同胞北来
    谴责李承晚集团的“移民”罪恶行为
    清津市等地四十万人集会高呼“美军滚出南朝鲜！”
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明说，共和国政府以全体朝鲜人民的名义，再一次坚决谴责李承晚集团的“移民”阴谋，并且强硬要求李承晚集团立即停止这一背叛民族利益的犯罪行为。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次强硬要求，美帝国主义和李承晚集团必须把他们想要强迫放逐到外国去的南朝鲜同胞全部送来共和国北部，并且要求南朝鲜当局迅速派出代表，在板门店或其他地点举行南北朝鲜当局代表的会谈，以实际解决这一问题。
    声明说，共和国政府在今年1月22日曾经发表声明，谴责李承晚集团企图把南朝鲜居民强迫移往拉丁美洲国家去的阴谋，并要求把全部要“移居”的南朝鲜失业者、李伪军的退伍军人和被劫往南朝鲜去的朝鲜北部居民都送到朝鲜北部来。但是，李承晚集团不但不接受这个从同胞友爱出发的建议，却在美帝国主义的操纵下，继续疯狂地推行“移民”阴谋。声明说，李承晚集团在5月11日公布了“海外移民委员会法令”，使它的犯罪的“移民”计划进入实践阶段。
    声明强调说：共和国政府对此“不能熟视无睹”。“全体朝鲜人民决不允许美帝国主义和李承晚集团以‘移民’的名义把我们的同胞强迫卖给外国资本家和农场主的凶恶企图”。
    声明说，共和国北部在经济和文化等各方面都取得了朝鲜历史上未曾有过的繁荣，“共和国北部人民渴望同南朝鲜兄弟一同享受自己辛勤劳动的果实，并为接受呻吟在水深火热之中的南朝鲜所有的失业者、离乡农民和战灾孤儿，保证他们过安定的生活作好了准备”。
    声明说：“共和国政府向南朝鲜当局建议，为了拆除使父母兄弟在咫尺之间不能相见的人为的墙壁，并为了使南北朝鲜所有的人能够自由来往，首先指定板门店和铁原以及双方协议的其他地点为自由来往的地点。”声明说：“我们向愿意自由来往的所有的人任何时候都开着大门，并保证他们的人身安全，为他们提供方便。”
  　声明说：“今天朝鲜人民的民族分裂和南朝鲜同胞所遭受到的难以形容的悲伤和痛苦的根源就在于美帝国主义强占着南朝鲜。美帝国主义者必须早日从南朝鲜滚出去。李承晚集团的反动统治制度必须废除，朝鲜应当由朝鲜人自己早日实现和平统一。”
    声明说：“南朝鲜的悲惨状况，就使祖国的和平统一作为刻不容缓的迫切问题被提出来了。”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府“随时准备同南朝鲜当局在一起进行协商”，“只要是为了祖国的和平统一挺身而出的人，不论是谁，我们将不咎既往，同他们携手前进。”
    新华社平壤21日电　从17日起到今天为止，朝鲜北部各道首府和开城市共有近四十万群众举行了集会，抗议和谴责美国和李承晚集团把南朝鲜人卖给外国当奴隶的所谓“移民”阴谋。
    在清津市今天举行的有五万人参加的群众大会上，工人代表、金策制铁所劳动英雄金昌秀说，朝鲜人民一定要粉碎美国和李承晚集团把南朝鲜兄弟卖给奴隶贩子的阴谋。他呼吁南朝鲜工人和全体人民为早日把美军赶出南朝鲜、争取祖国的和平统一而斗争。
    沙里院市九龙农业社社长奇元吉在沙里院市的群众集会上说：我们坚决要求美李集团立即停止这种贩卖人口的罪行，并且要求把被卖给外国的南朝鲜同胞送到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的温暖怀抱里来。
    在这些集会上，朝鲜北部各界人民的代表一致愤怒谴责美国和李承晚集团的这一罪行，到会群众齐声高呼：“美军滚出南朝鲜！”
