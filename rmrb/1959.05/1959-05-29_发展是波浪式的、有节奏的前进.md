    Development is a Wave-Like, Rhythmic Advance
    Wu Chuanqi

    The world is like "an infinite ocean, a continuous wave" ("Faust"). This sentence can be borrowed to vividly illustrate the dialectic of the development process of things. Wave-like forward motion and spiral-like upward motion are the universal laws of the development process of all things.
    "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." This is the Party's general line for socialist construction. It is a beacon illuminating all our work and the basic guiding principle for all our practical work. However, based on the general line, the actual process of development of production and construction must be expressed as a wave-like, rhythmic forward motion. This means that, on the one hand, we must make our efforts more and more vigorous and aim higher and higher. On the other hand, each specific development process must have its own ups and downs and rhythms. There must be periods of high tide, as well as periods of rectification, consolidation, and intermission; there must be hard battles, as well as recuperation; there must be urgency and slowness, tightness and looseness. Immediately following each high tide, a period of rectification and consolidation is needed, and any rectification and consolidation will inevitably lead to a new high tide. Repeating in this way, each wave is higher than the last, and each time is more comprehensive, more profound, more specific, and more advanced. This kind of development expresses "aiming high" in guiding principles and manifests as a wave-like, rhythmic forward motion in the real process.

    Why does the objective process always manifest as wave-like motion? Dialectics tells us that the transformation of any phenomenon into its opposite, and the qualitative change of things, must be based on the premise of quantitative preparation. Quantitative change must be transformed into qualitative change; and qualitative change must inevitably be transformed into a stage of quantitative change on a new basis. Taking the technical innovation movement in industrial and agricultural production as an example, people can only propose tasks that can be solved based on the existing technical level. In each production department and specific enterprise, the emergence of each new creation and invention means a qualitative "leap" for the old technology. However, immediately following the emergence of each new creation and invention, a process of continuous improvement, popularization, and promotion is needed, so as to "leap" forward again on a new basis. If people engage in a high tide of creation and invention every day, without paying attention to promotion, popularization, and improvement, they cannot actually push the process to a new qualitative stage. Because any technical invention and creation, in the final analysis, is to be promoted to the entire production department and enterprise, and used to improve the overall level of labor productivity. The same is true between creating advanced experience and summarizing and promoting advanced experience, between development and consolidation and improvement, etc. They all develop rhythmically in this way. In particular, the emergence of each new thing is never perfect from the beginning, so it always needs a process of quantitative change on a new basis. In short, the state of motion of things is absolute, but it also has its relative state of rest; there is a "theory of continuous revolution," and there is also a "theory of stages of revolutionary development." The combination of such absolute motion and relative rest, the combination of the "theory of continuous revolution" and the "theory of stages of revolutionary development," and the combination of the qualitative change stage and the quantitative change stage, constitute a wave-like, rhythmic forward motion in the entirety of the development process.

    Without ups and downs, there would be no waves, and no rhythm. Music without rhythm cannot be a musical piece. Any good poetry and prose must have its own rhythm; any good drama must also have its own rhythm, in order to push the plot step by step to a climax, or to develop one climax after another. In natural phenomena, there is sunrise and sunset in a day; there is a full moon and a waning moon in a month. A year has four seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. As the saying goes, "One winter, one spring, nothing is bent without stretching, one rise, one fall, nothing does not return" (Liu Ji). This is the rhythm of the natural seasons. In short, all phenomena develop rhythmically.

    The objective process always advances along a "zigzag" path. People who recognize this law, master it proactively, and skillfully apply it can correctly deal with problems, accurately grasp opportunities, and accelerate the development of the process. However, when we start to work, it is common to find that we are slower when we want to be faster, and we take detours when we want to take shortcuts, that is, "haste makes waste." Conversely, it is also common to find that "the crooked is complete, the bent is straight" (Lao Tzu), and "the latecomer arrives first" ("Sun Tzu's Art of War"). The two situations are just the difference between violating dialectics and conforming to dialectics.

    The actual situation is often like this: retreating in order to leap forward often leads to a farther leap; rising and falling often leads to a higher rise; retreating in order to attack often leads to greater victories. In mechanics, there is a situation where distance is lost but speed is gained; in dynamics, an object moving along a cycloid falls faster from top to bottom than moving along a straight line; the reason why bullets fly fast and shoot far is because they move through a spiral curve. In our actual work, a mass movement to produce iron and steel was launched in 1958, and a large number of small blast furnaces were built, which was a huge development. But on the new basis, there must be a stage of rectification and improvement, which requires implementing the "Three Fixes" according to the conditions, improving and developing those that meet the conditions, and eliminating those that do not. In industrial production, due to the different degrees of coordination of raw materials and other conditions, there will also be their own waves. Even people's process of summarizing objective things develops along a curve. All these illustrate that the development of things is not "straight forward" and not "linearly upward," but a wave-like advance and a spiral-like ascent. Understanding this dialectic is of great significance for correctly looking at problems and guiding work, especially for overcoming the one-sidedness of linearization in thinking methods and work styles.

    Opposed to this dialectical view, there are often two opposite and one-sided views from the two extremes: one is only falling and not rising, only slow and not fast; the other is only rising and not falling, only knowing to be fast and not knowing to be slow. Both are manifestations of linearization in thinking methods. Being able to bend and stretch conforms to dialectics. Conversely, being able to bend but not stretch, or being able to stretch but not bend, are both manifestations of metaphysics.

    The developing real world will never be like a pool of stagnant water. But some people always hope to live a peaceful life. When walking, they can only "follow the rules" and "obey the rules," like a "small-footed woman," swaying back and forth. Chairman Mao once told us, "Such people are always passive, always stop moving forward at critical moments, and always need someone to slap them on the back before they are willing to take a step forward." ("Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," footnote) Or, when the high tide of the mass movement rises, some people are alarmed by certain individual shortcomings, distorting black and white; denying achievements, and negating the high tide. In short, this kind of thinking only knows falling and not rising, only bending and not stretching, and always attempts to demand the real world of "endless torrents rolling in" with the subjective wish of "calm and waveless."

    Similarly, the development of things is not straight and straight. But some people often start from another extreme and linearize all problems. Or they think that to engage in a high tide, they can only go up in one breath; to fight hard, they can only fight hard in one breath. Walking without knowing how to turn, looking ahead without knowing how to look back, grabbing one end and losing the other. This way of thinking does not understand the rhythm of the development of things, and does not know that "nothing is bent without stretching" and "not stopping, not going" is the dialectic of the development of things. If you do not understand the inherent and lawful rhythm of things, you cannot proactively and consciously master it. And if you are not good at grasping the rhythm, you cannot correctly guide the movement.

    People want to get up after sleeping enough. No one can just keep sleeping once they fall asleep, never getting up; nor can they keep working without rest, never sleeping or resting. Sleep and rest are contradictory to seizing time, but they are also unified. "Sleep and rest lose time, but gain the energy for tomorrow's work. If there is any fool who does not know this and refuses to sleep, he will have no energy tomorrow, which is a losing business" ("Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War"). People lose time when they sleep and rest, in order to gain more vigorous working energy, in order to seize the time of the next day, as the saying goes, "If you want to take it, you must first give it." From the perspective of the relationship between work and rest, work—sleep and rest—work again is a rhythmic and dialectical formula. From the perspective of the relationship between work and rest, repeating in this way, one will be full of energy and enthusiasm. Conversely, if it is just work—work—work again; or just rest—rest—rest again, this rigid and arrhythmic formula can only become absurd and a laughing stock.

    It also needs to be pointed out that the so-called development is a wave-like, rhythmic forward motion, which is also a development process from simple to complex and from elementary to advanced. Any specific phenomenon and process has a beginning and an end, and any phenomenon and process transforms into its opposite. For example, the formula "unity—criticism—unity," "starting from the desire for unity," and "reaching new unity on a new basis" requires going through the process of "criticism and self-criticism." Transforming from "unity" to "criticism" is the first negation; returning from "criticism and struggle" to "unity" is the second negation. This is the dialectical law of "affirmation and negation," or the law of negation of negation. The same is true for practice, knowledge, and re-practice; balance, breakthrough, and re-balance, etc. They all develop forward in this way with ups and downs and "affirmation and negation." This is the universal law of dialectics regarding the development process of things. "Rise" and "fall" are contradictory and unified, and the fall of the previous wave is the preparation for the rise of the next wave. In this sense, "one rise, one fall, nothing does not return" is dialectics, that is, Lenin said, "It is as if it were a return to the old" ("Philosophical Notebooks"). Conversely, if "once gone, never returned," only falling and not rising, or only going and never returning, it is linearization and metaphysics.

    In short, things are always developing forward, but the specific process is not straight and straight, but a wave-like forward motion. This dialectical law requires people to look at problems with foresight, to have a panoramic view of the entire process, to anticipate the progress of events, and to promote the great leap forward of production and work rhythmically and without losing the opportunity.

    发展是波浪式的、有节奏的前进
    吴传启
    世界就像“一个无限的海洋，一个连续的波浪”（“浮士德”）。这句话可以借用来形象地说明事物发展过程的辩证法。波浪式的前进运动，螺旋式的上升运动，是一切事物发展过程的普遍规律。
    “鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”，这是党的社会主义建设的总路线，是照耀我们一切工作的灯塔，是我们一切实际工作的基本的指导原则。但是，在总路线的基础上，对于生产和建设事业发展的现实过程来说，又必然要表现为一个波浪式的、有节奏的前进运动。这就是说，在一方面，我们必须把干劲越鼓越足，上游越争越高；而在每一具体的发展过程中，又都要有它自己的起伏和节奏。要有高潮时期，也要有整顿、巩固和间歇时期；要有苦战，也要有休整；有急也有缓，有紧也有松。紧接着每一次的高潮，都需要一个整顿和巩固时期；而任何一次的整顿和巩固，又都必然地要导向一个新的高潮。如此循环往复，一浪比一浪高，一次比一次更全面、更深刻、更具体、更先进。这种发展，就既是在指导原则上表现了“力争上游”，又在现实过程中，表现为波浪式的、有节奏的前进运动。
    为什么客观过程总是表现为波浪式的运动？辩证法告诉我们，任何现象向自己的对立面转化，事物的质的变化，必须以量变的准备为前提，量变必然要转化为质变；而质的变化，又必然要转化为在新基础上的量变阶段。拿工农业生产过程中的技术革新运动来说，人们只能在现有的技术水平上提出可能解决的任务。在每一个生产部门和具体企业中，当每一项新的创造发明的出现，对于旧的技术来说，都意味着一个质的“飞跃”。但紧接着每一项新的创造发明出现以后，必然需要一个不断完善和普及、推广的过程，从而才能在新的基础上再向前“飞跃”。如果人们天天搞创造发明的高潮，而不注意推广、普及和完善，就不能实际上把过程推向新的质的阶段。因为任何技术上的发明创造归根结底，是要推广到整个生产部门和企业中，用来提高劳动生产率的整个水平的。他如创造先进经验与总结和推广先进经验之间，发展和巩固提高之间等等，都是这种情形，都是这样有节奏地发展着的。特别是每一个新事物的出现，总不是一开始就是十分完善的，因此就总是需要一个在新基础上的量变的过程。总之，事物的运动状态是绝对的，但又有其相对的静止状态；有“不断革命论”，也有“革命发展的阶段论”。如此绝对运动和相对静止的结合，“不断革命论”和“革命发展阶段论”的结合，质变阶段和量变阶段的结合，就在发展过程的全体上，构成为波浪式的、有节奏的前进运动。
    没有起伏，就无所谓波浪，也无所谓节奏。音乐没有节奏，就不成其为乐曲。任何好的诗文，必须要有自己的节奏；任何一个好的戏剧，也都要有自己的节奏，才能把剧情一步步地推向高潮，或者一个高潮接一个高潮地发展下去。在自然现象里，一日之中，有日出也有日入；一月之中，有月圆也有月缺。一年有春夏秋冬四季，所谓“一冬一春，靡屈不伸，一起一伏，无往不复”（刘基语），这是自然季节的节奏。总之，一切现象都是有节奏地发展着的。
    客观过程总是循着“之”字路前进的，人们认识这个规律，主动地掌握它，熟练地运用它，就能正确地对待问题，准确地掌握时机，加速过程的发展。然而当我们做起工作来，想快一些反而慢了，欲抄直路反而走了弯路，即“欲速则不达”的情形是常有的。反之，“曲则全，枉则直”（老子），“后人发，先人至”（“孙子兵法”）的情形，也是常有的。两种情形，不过是违反了辩证法和符合于辩证法之分罢了。
    实际情形常常是这样的：为了一跃而后退，往往跃得更远；为了一起而一伏，往往起得更高；为了进攻而退却，往往取得更大的战果。在机械学上，有失之于距离，而得之于速率的情形；在力学上，按摆线运动的物体，从上面向下落，要比依直线运动来得快；枪弹之所以飞得快、射得远，就因为它是通过螺旋式的曲线运动的。在我们的实际工作中，1958年开展了大办钢铁的群众运动，办起了一大批小高炉，这是一个巨大的发展。但在新的基础上，不能没有一个整顿和提高的阶段，这就需要根据条件实行“三定”，把合乎条件的加以提高发展，把不合乎条件的加以淘汰。在工业生产中，由于原材料和其它各种条件配合程度的不同，也会出现自己的波浪。就是人对于客观事物的总结过程，也是按曲线发展的。如此等等，都说明了事物的发展，不是“笔直前进”，不是“直线上升”；而是波浪式的前进，螺旋式的上升。懂得了这个辩证法，对于正确地看问题和指导工作，特别是对于克服思想方法上和工作作风上直线化的片面性，有十分重大的意义。
    同这种辩证观点相对立，常常有两种相反的、从两极而来的片面观点：一种是只伏不起，只能慢不能快；另一种是只起不伏，只知要快而不知要慢。二者都是思想方法上直线化的表现。能屈能伸，这是合乎辩证法的。反之，能屈不能伸，或者能伸不能屈，则都是形而上学的表现。
    发展着的现实世界，决不会是像一潭死水一样的。但有的人总是希望风平浪静地过日子。走起路来只能“按部就班”，“循规蹈矩”，像一个“小脚女人”，摇摇摆摆。毛主席曾经告诉我们，“这种人老是被动，在紧要的关头老是止步不前，老是需要别人在他的背上击一猛掌，才肯向前跨进一步。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”按语）或者是当群众运动的高潮起来了以后，有的人一旦看到了某些个别缺点，就大惊小怪，颠倒黑白；否认成绩，否定高潮。总之，这种思想只知伏而不知起，只屈不伸，总是企图用“平静无波”的主观愿望，来要求“不尽洪流滚滚来”的现实世界。
    同样，事物的发展不是笔直又笔直的。但有的人常常从另一个极端出发，把一切问题加以直线化。或者是认为要搞高潮就只能一股劲儿一直高上去；要苦战就只能一股劲儿一直苦战下去。走路而不知转弯，瞻前而不知顾后，抓了这一头丢了那一头。这种思想方法，就是不懂得事物发展的节奏性，不知道“靡屈不伸”，“不止不行”，是事物发展的辩证法。不懂得事物自身的、合规律的节奏，就不能主动地自觉地去掌握它。而不善于掌握节奏，就不能正确地指导运动。
    人们睡足了觉要起床。任何人不能一睡觉就老是睡下去，永不起床；也不能一直工作不歇，永不睡眠和休息。睡眠和休息与争取时间之间，是矛盾的，但又是统一的。“睡眠和休息丧失了时间，却取得了明天工作的精力。如果有什么蠢人，不知此理，拒绝睡觉，他明天就没有精神了，这是蚀本生意”（“中国革命战争的战略问题”）。人们在睡眠和休息时丧失了时间，是为了取得更旺盛的工作精力，是为了争取第二天的时间，所谓“将欲取之必先与之”。从工作和休息的关系上来说，工作——睡眠和休息——再工作，这是一个有节奏的、辩证的公式。从工作和休息关系上来说，如此循环往复，精神百倍，干劲十足。反之，如果要就是工作——工作——再工作；或者要就是休息——休息——再休息，这种死板的、无节奏的公式，就只能成为荒谬和笑谈了。
    还需要指出的是，所谓发展是波浪式的有节奏的前进运动，也就是一个由简单到复杂、由初级向高级的发展过程。任何具体现象和过程都是有始有终，任何现象和过程都向自己的对立面转化。比如“团结——批评——团结”这个公式，“从团结的愿望出发”，要“在新基础上达到新的团结”，就需要经过“批评和自我批评”的过程。从“团结”转化为“批评”，这是第一个否定；从“批评和斗争”再回到“团结”，这是第二个否定。这就是辩证法的“肯定、否定”的规律，或叫做否定之否定的规律。他如实践、认识、再实践，平衡、突破、再平衡等等，都是这样有起有伏和“肯定否定”地向前发展的过程。这是辩证法关于事物发展过程的普遍规律。“起”和“伏”是对立的，又是统一的，前浪之伏为后浪之起的准备条件。在这个意义上，“一起一伏，无往不复”，是辩证法，即列宁说过的“仿佛是向旧东西的回复”（“哲学笔记”）。反之，如果“一往不复”，只伏不起或者只往不复，则是直线化的形而上学。
    总之，事物总是不断向前发展的，但具体过程却不是笔直又笔直的，而是波浪式的前进运动。这个辩证规律要求人们看问题要高瞻远瞩，通观过程的全体，预察事变的进程，要有节奏而又不失时机地促进生产和工作的大跃进。
