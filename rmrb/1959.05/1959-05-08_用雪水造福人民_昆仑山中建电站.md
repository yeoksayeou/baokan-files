Using Snow Water to Benefit the People
	Kunlun Mountains Build Power Station
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 7th—A 12,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power station is under construction on the Golmud River in the Kunlun Mountains. Construction workers have already set up camp in the valley to prepare for building the dam.

This is a power station that uses the abundant snow water of the Kunlun Mountains to generate electricity. It is about forty kilometers away from the emerging city of Golmud in the Qaidam Basin. After the dam is built, a gourd-shaped reservoir will appear in the Kunlun Mountains, which can regulate the water volume of the Golmud River.

Golmud is the gateway from Qinghai to Tibet. Automobile repair, building materials, and leather factories have been established here. Iron and coal mines are being mined, and tens of thousands of mu of farmland have also been cultivated. After the power station is completed, it will promote the development of industry and agriculture in this area.

　　用雪水造福人民
    昆仑山中建电站
    新华社西宁7日电　昆仑山中的格尔木河上，正在修建一座发电能力为一万二千瓩的水电站。建站工人们已经到山谷里安营扎寨，准备修筑拦河坝。
    这是一座利用昆仑山丰富的雪水发电的电站，距柴达木盆地的新兴城市格尔木约四十公里，拦河坝筑成后，昆仑山中将出现一座葫芦形的水库，可以调节格尔木河的水量。
    格尔木是青海通往西藏的咽喉，这里已建立了汽车修配、建筑材料、制革等工厂，正在开采铁矿、煤矿，还开垦了几万亩农田。电站建成后，将促进这个地区工农业的发展。
