Comrades Representatives:

　　We fully agree with the various reports made at the conference by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and express our heartfelt support.

　　We are a few natural science workers, and like all the representatives, we spent the great year of the nationwide and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in our country last year with excitement. We feel infinitely happy and full of faith that our motherland and 600 million people, under the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the shining light of the general line of socialist construction, are advancing towards a happy and beautiful future at the highest speed. We express our boundless indignation at the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland. We firmly support the central government's policy of thoroughly quelling the rebellion and swiftly realizing national regional autonomy and gradually carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet. Now, we would like to explain some situations and express some opinions to the conference on the issue of taking the mass line in our own scientific research work last year.

　　Scientific research work taking the mass line has achieved a thorough reform in all aspects.

　　Scientific research has long been considered a very profound and mysterious work, not understood by everyone, and even less capable of being done by everyone. During the rectification movement, the Party proposed that science should be grasped by the broad masses, but at that time, many people, including ourselves, could not quickly comprehend this. We always thought that mass movements could be carried out vigorously in industrial and agricultural production, but scientific work could not or was difficult to do the same way, and it must be emphasized that only a few people could quietly explore in the laboratory for a long time to achieve outstanding results. Therefore, before the Great Leap Forward last year, there were various ideas about whether or how scientific research work should take the mass line, and most people's understanding was not clear enough.

　　At that time, the work of many scientific research departments, although developed to a certain extent, was mostly carried out under the direct guidance or personal participation of a small number of elderly and middle-aged scientists. It failed to give play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses and to absorb more young staff to carry out larger-scale scientific research. This made the work difficult to carry out, with many difficulties, and the business direction and academic guiding ideology of many research departments were in a very unclear state for a long time. For example, the issue of how to more closely integrate many research projects with production could not be well resolved. Precisely because the goal was unclear, the direction was wavering, and the work progress was slow. This situation made some scientific workers begin to doubt whether all aspects of China's science and technology could be raised to the international level by the end of the third Five-Year Plan, in 1967.

　　With the development of the overall situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, scientific research work implemented the spirit of the general line of socialist construction formulated by the Party, broke superstitions, overcame conservative thinking, and implemented the policy of combining centralized leadership with mass movement, taking a big leap forward and achieving great achievements. The scale and speed of development can be said to be unprecedented. Therefore, China's scientific research cause has completely changed its past appearance and emerged with a situation full of new forces, with a promising future.

　　This fundamental transformation was realized on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the vigorous technical revolution, and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses. First, the ranks of scientific researchers were expanded, and the work was handed over to a wider range of people to do. All issues were discussed by everyone, and the masses actively and proactively played the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, providing all possible opinions and methods. After discussing and determining the direction and specific tasks of each research work, quarterly, annual, and long-term work plans were formulated, stipulating the requirements for each work result. This immediately made all staff, regardless of their positions, clarify their specific tasks and goals of struggle, and from then on, their enthusiasm became even higher. While carrying out mass scientific research work, the leadership adopted a method of letting go and never forgetting to help check and urge, thinking of all possible ways and doing everything possible to overcome various difficulties together with everyone. In this way, a large number of results appeared in a short period of time. Some research projects that were previously considered impossible to carry out with China's current scientific level, or that required a very long period of time to produce results, were quickly completed after mobilizing the masses, liberating their minds, and with the joint efforts of leading cadres, elderly and middle-aged scientists, and young staff. Some work that was previously considered to be postponed due to lack of strength is now in a position to be universally promoted, filling some scientific gaps. Young staff who were previously considered incompetent in scientific research, due to their full initiative, active and diligent spirit, mutual learning and help, and the guidance of old scientists on key issues, can prove themselves to be promising scientific researchers.

　　According to our personal experience, the results of scientific work since following the mass line pointed out by the Party are manifested in these new signs in terms of the work itself. In addition, it has also produced many extremely beneficial impacts on the rapid development and improvement of China's scientific cause. For example, in order to complete common and specific research tasks, everyone has a common language, cooperates with each other, and relies on the collective to discuss and solve problems, which greatly enhances and improves the unity between staff, especially the relationship between elderly and young scientific researchers.

　　The above only briefly describes the basic situation and the great achievements made since China's scientific research cause fully launched its work in accordance with the mass line pointed out by the Party. Taking the method of the mass line to carry out scientific work is the most important basic experience gained in the Great Leap Forward last year. Since the Party put it forward and after its implementation, all aspects of China's scientific work have undergone a thorough reform. The task in the future is to better combine the characteristics of scientific work and further implement this line to enrich experience. We initially believe that we should pay attention to the following two aspects of the problem:

　　Cultivate young scientific and technical personnel who are both red and expert; Consolidate the scientific achievements made in the Great Leap Forward.

　　(1) For a specific scientific research department, we should pay attention to cultivating talents who are both red and expert from the large number of young scientific and technical personnel. For the whole country, we should pay attention to cultivating scientific talents from the broad working people. As our scientific work deepens, it is necessary for the knowledge of scientific researchers to be gradually systematized in order to rapidly advance in depth. Last year, a large part of our work was carried out on the basis of scientific literature from the Soviet Union and other countries. It is extremely encouraging to be able to initially master so many international advanced science and technologies in a very short period of time. However, precisely because of this high-speed development, the problem currently facing us requires us to quickly catch up with the knowledge level of our existing scientific workers in order to realize a further scientific Great Leap Forward. The work already in progress should make more creative improvements and developments, and the scientifically significant scientific achievements that have been discovered must be gradually placed on a systematic theoretical basis. As for the method of cultivation, it should still be to exercise in practical work, while attaching importance to basic knowledge, theoretical knowledge, and systematic training in scientific work methods. Learn while doing, advance direct knowledge and indirect knowledge, practice and theory. The scientific team has already made great progress, which is a broad source for cultivating a large number of research talents. When the masses play a collective role, jointly study business, exchange learning with each other, and their active, proactive, enterprising spirit, and the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, are important guarantees for them to be trained into scientific researchers with a high academic level and both red and expert in a short period of time. They will certainly be able to take on the task of further developing China's scientific research work.

　　(2) We should pay attention to consolidating the scientific achievements made in the Great Leap Forward. Last year, due to the short working time and some incomplete technical conditions, some of the work results did not meet the expected standards. This phenomenon is extremely natural and difficult to avoid. The correct attitude to treat this fact is to rely on everyone to carry out a consolidation work in a relatively short period of time. Seek truth from facts, strictly verify some research results, so as to determine the parts that must be improved, and still rely on the efforts of the masses to thoroughly do the supplementary work with the original enthusiasm, and strive to quickly reach the specified requirements. Some projects still need to continue to work for a longer period of time.

　　Comrades Representatives! Although it has not been long since we truly embarked on scientific research work by following the mass line pointed out by the Party, and the experience is not deep enough, we firmly believe that this is the only way to develop China's scientific work and make it quickly reach the international level, and it is a key found by the Party for us. When we recall the stagnant situation of burying our heads in hard research alone in those years, with slow work progress and few achievements, it makes our minds clearer, distinguishes the completely different nature of the two scientific paths, and recognizes the unparalleled superiority of the socialist scientific path. We express that we will resolutely follow this path, strive to improve our political consciousness, improve our thinking and working methods, and go forward with revolutionary enthusiasm, and fight to the end for China's scientific cause!

　　科学研究也必须走群众路线
    钱崇澍　竺可桢　赵忠尧　董聿茂　贝时璋  陆士嘉　顾功叙代表的联合发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意周恩来总理，李富春副总理，李先念副总理和彭真副委员长在大会上所作的各项报告，并表示衷心地拥护。
    我们是几个自然科学工作者，和各位代表一样，在去年我国全民全面大跃进的形势中，都是心情振奋地渡过了这个伟大的一年。我们对于祖国和六亿人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确英明领导下，社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，正以最高速度向着幸福美好的未来前进，感到无限愉快，充满信念。对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义，蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，背叛祖国，表示无比愤慨。我们坚决拥护中央彻底平息叛乱，并迅速在西藏实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革的方针。现在就去年我们自己所进行的科学研究工作走上群众路线的问题，向大会说明一些情况并发表一些意见。
    科学研究工作走群众路线，在各方面都获得一次彻底的革新
    科学研究长期以来被认为是一种很高深奥妙的工作，不是人人懂得，更非人人能做。整风运动中，党提出科学要为广大群众所掌握，当时在许多人的思想中包括我们在内是不能很快就领会的。总以为工农业生产可以开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动，但科学工作不能或是很难照样做，而必须强调只能由少数人关在实验室里安安静静地长期探索，才有可能取得杰出的成果。因此在去年大跃进以前，科学研究工作应不应该走群众路线或是如何走群众路线的问题，还有各种各样的想法，多数人的认识是不够明确的。
    当时许多科学研究部门的工作，虽有一定程度的开展，但多半是在为数很少的老年和中年科学家直接指导或亲身参加下进行的。并没有能够发挥群众的积极性和智慧，和吸收更多的青年工作人员来展开更大规模的科学研究。这样就使工作施展不开，困难重重，有许多研究部门的业务方向，学术指导思想，都长期陷于很不明确的状态，例如，很多研究项目如何与生产更密切结合的问题，就得不到很好解决。正由于目标不明，方向摇摆不定，工作进展迟缓。这种情况就使有些科学工作者，开始对于到第三个五年计划末，一九六七年，我国科学技术的各方面能不能提高到国际水平，多少发生了怀疑。
    随着一九五八年全面大跃进整个形势的发展，科学研究工作，贯彻了党所制定的社会主义建设总路线的精神，破除了迷信，克服了保守思想，执行了集中领导与群众运动相结合的方针，向前大大跃进了一步，取得了很大的成就。发展的规模与速度都可以说是史无前例的。因而就使我国的科学研究事业，完全改变了过去的面貌，出现了充满着新生力量的局面，前途大有希望。
    这一根本性的转变是在整风运动反右斗争胜利，大闹技术革命，群众干劲冲天的基础上实现的。首先是扩大了科学研究人员的队伍，把工作交给更广大的群众去做，一切问题经过大家的讨论，群众积极主动地发挥了敢想敢说敢做的风格，提供出一切能提的意见和办法。讨论确定各门研究工作的方向和具体任务之后，制订了季度年度和远景的工作计划，规定了对每一项工作成果的要求。这样就立刻使全体工作人员不论职别，都明确了自己的具体任务和奋斗目标，从此积极性更为高涨。在开展群众性科学研究工作的同时，领导上采取了既放手而又时刻不忘帮助检查督促的方式与大家一起想尽办法，千方百计地克服种种困难。这样在短期内就出现了大量的结果。有些研究项目过去认为以我国目前的科学水平还不可能进行的，或是必须经过很长时期才能作出成果的，而发动群众以后，大家解放了思想，在领导干部，老年中年科学家和青年工作人员的共同努力下，这种科学任务，迅速得到了完成。也有某些工作过去由于缺乏力量认为可以暂缓进行的，现在已有条件普遍推动，填补了一些科学空白点。过去认为不能胜任科学研究的青年工作人员，由于他们充分发挥了主动积极钻研的精神，他们相互之间的学习帮助，老科学家们在环节性问题上的指点，都能证明自己为大有培养前途的科学研究人员。
    根据我们切身体会，科学工作自从在党的领导下走向群众路线以后的结果，表现于工作本身方面就有这些新的征象。除此以外，也产生了不少对于我国科学事业的迅速发展和提高极为有利的影响，例如，大家为了完成共同的具体研究任务，有了共同的语言，相互合作，依靠集体来讨论和解决问题，这就大大增进和改善了工作人员彼此之间的团结，特别是老年与青年科学研究人员之间的关系。
    以上只简略地叙述了我国的科学研究事业，依照了党所指出的群众路线，全面展开了工作以来的基本情况，和所取得的巨大成就。科学工作也必须采取走群众路线的方法来进行，是在去年大跃进中得来的最重要的基本经验。自从党提出，经过贯彻执行，我国科学工作的各方面都获得了一次彻底的革新。今后的任务是要更好地结合科学工作的特点，进一步贯彻执行这条路线，以丰富经验。我们初步认为当前应该注意这样二方面的问题：
    培养又红又专的青年科学技术人员；巩固在大跃进中取得的科学成果
    （1）对于一个具体科学研究部门来说，要注意培养从大批的青年科学技术人员中涌现出来的又红又专的人材。对于全国来说要注意培养从广大劳动人民中涌现出来的科学人材。当我们的科学工作愈深入，科学研究人员的知识就有必要逐步得到系统化，才有可能迅速向深入提高方面进展。去年我们的工作内容很大部分是在苏联及其他国家的科学文献的基础上开展起来的。这样能够在极短促的时间内，初步掌握了这许多国际间的先进科学技术，是一件极为鼓舞人心的事情。但是正由于这种高速度的发展，目前摆在我们面前的问题，就需要很快使我们现有的科学工作人员的知识水平赶上去，以便实现再进一步的科学大跃进。已在进行的工作应该作出更多的创造性的提高和发展，已被发现的有独创意义的科学成果，必须逐步使其置放到系统的理论基础上去。至于培养的方式，仍旧应该是在实际工作中锻炼，同时重视基础知识，理论知识以及科学工作方法的系统训练。边做边学，直接知识与间接知识、实践与理论并进。现在科学队伍已有很大发展，这是培养大批研究人材的广阔来源，当群众发挥了集体的作用，共同钻研业务，相互交流学习和他们的主动积极、奋发有为的精神，敢想敢说敢做的风格，是他们能够在短期间内培养成为具备较高学术水平、又红又专的科学研究人员的重要保证。他们一定能够胜任进一步发展我国科学研究工作的任务。
    （2）要注意巩固在大跃进中所取得的科学成果。去年由于工作时间短，某些技术条件不齐备，确实有一部分的工作成果没有达到预定的标准，这种现象是极其自然的也很难避免的。正确地对待这一事实的态度是应该在较短的时期内依靠大家进行一番巩固的工作。实事求是地把某些研究成果加以严格的检定，从而确定其中必须改进的部分，仍旧要依靠群众的努力，以原来的干劲彻底地做好补充工作，力求很快地达到所标定的要求。有些项目还有必要继续进行较长时期的工作。
    各位代表！虽然由于我们真正走上党所指出的群众路线而进行科学研究工作为时尚短，体会不够深刻，但是我们完全相信，这是发展我国科学工作，使它迅速达到国际水平的唯一的途径，是党给我们找出的一把钥匙。当我们 回想到当年只凭个人埋头苦研，工作进展缓慢，成果微少的停滞情况，更使我们的头脑清醒起来，分清了两条科学道路的性质的截然不同，认识到社会主义科学道路的无比优越。我们表示将坚决遵循着这条道路，努力提高政治觉悟，改进自己的思想和工作方法，鼓起革命干劲前进，为我国的科学事业而奋斗到底！
