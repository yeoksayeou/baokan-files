　　Premier Münnich's Speech at the Banquet Held by the Hungarian Ambassador to China

　　Dear Comrade Zhu De, dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear Comrades, dear Friends!

　　On behalf of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, I extend warm, fraternal greetings to you, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China, the outstanding figures from all walks of life in Chinese politics, economics, culture, and society, and all dear guests! And I take this opportunity to express my gratitude once again for your friendly invitation and incredibly warm reception.

　　Not long ago, in our country, people knew very little about your great motherland, but today, the People's Republic of China is the socialist country, second only to the Soviet Union, that our people are most concerned about. In our country, everyone knows today that the Chinese people won their freedom under the leadership of the Communist Party. Everyone knows that thanks to the organizational work, propaganda, and education of the Chinese Communist Party, and the spirit of sacrifice of the Chinese working people, everything that had weighed down on the Chinese people for centuries—hunger, epidemics, diseases, and natural disasters—has now been largely eliminated. We do not intend to repeatedly mention the past, but sometimes it is good to recall the past years, not for any other reason, but only so that the fruits of the labor of the liberated people can shine even more brightly in contrast to the dark past. Of course, we also know that it is impossible to eliminate all the miserable things left over from the past in just a few short years, and we know that the Chinese working people still face great difficulties and some years of struggle. However, the achievements already made prove that the great China will develop even more rapidly in the future, and the creative energy of the Chinese people will surely overcome all difficulties.

　　The particularly outstanding achievements made by the Chinese people in the recent year and a half have also encouraged our people. In our country, people today regard China as a country that has already set the goal of surpassing Britain in production within a few years, and that is already competing with the United States in agricultural production. Today's China is a great socialist power. Due to the conspiracies of imperialism, China has not yet been able to occupy its rightful place in the United Nations. However, this fact cannot in the slightest affect its position and prestige in world politics, nor its decisive role in international affairs. The great socialist China stands at the forefront of the struggle for world peace, fighting alongside the Soviet Union. This great country is working to maintain peace, which is a reassuring belief for the people of all countries. We are very happy and proud to talk about these things, and the imperialists have to grit their teeth and admit this fact.

　　Dear Comrades:

　　We have spent unforgettable days in your country. Everything we have seen, our meetings with the Chinese working people, the fraternal love they have shown us, and the enthusiastic and hard work that is being carried out in your country, have left us with indelible impressions. We feel that through our visit and the treaty of friendship and cooperation just signed, the friendly and comradely relations between us have become even closer and deeper. We believe that in the future we will be able to cooperate more closely and support each other better in all aspects of politics, economics, and culture.

　　We assure you that we will faithfully report the rich experiences of the days spent here and the lessons we have learned to the working people of our country, and we will deliver the thousands of greetings you have entrusted to us to them.

　　I propose a toast: to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the eternal friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese peoples!

　　Long live the great bulwark of peace—the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

　　在匈牙利驻华大使举行的宴会上
    明尼赫总理的讲话亲爱的朱德同志，亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    我代表匈牙利党政代表团向你们，中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导人，中国政治、经济、文化和社会等各界的卓越人物，以及所有的亲爱的贵宾们，表示热烈的、兄弟般的敬礼。并且我借此机会在这里对你们的友好邀请和无比亲切的接待，再一次表示感谢。
    不久以前，在我国，人们对你们伟大的祖国还了解得很少，但是在今天，中华人民共和国已经是除了苏联以外为我国人民最关心的社会主义国家了。在我国，今天每一个人都知道，中国人民是在共产党的领导下赢得自由的。每一个人都知道，由于中国共产党的组织工作、宣传教育工作和中国劳动人民的牺牲精神，千百年来压在中国人民头上的饥饿、传染病、疾病和自然灾害等一切，现在都已经基本上被消灭了。我们并不是要再三地提到过去，但是有时候回忆一下过去的年月也是有好处的，这并不是为了什么别的缘故，而只是为了要使解放了的人民的劳动成果，在同黑暗的过去对照之下，能够更加显示出它的光辉。当然，我们也知道，过去遗留下来的一切悲惨的东西是不可能在短短几年内消灭的，我们知道，在中国劳动人民面前，还有着很大困难和一些斗争的年月，但是已得的成就都证明了：伟大的中国今后将发展得更加迅速，中国人民的创造性的干劲一定能够克服一切困难。
    中国人民在最近一年半的时期里获得的特别卓越的成就也鼓舞着我国人民。在我国，今天人们是把中国作为一个已经提出在生产上几年内超过英国的目标的，而且在农业生产上今天已经同美国竞赛的国家来看待的。今天的中国是社会主义的大国。由于帝国主义的阴谋，中国至今还不能在联合国中占有它应得的地位。但是，这个事实并不能使它在世界政治中的地位和威望，以及它在国际问题上起决定性的作用方面受到丝毫影响。伟大的社会主义中国站在世界和平斗争的前列，同苏联一起进行着斗争。这个伟大的国家正在为维护和平而努力，这对世界各国人民来说，是一个令人感到安宁的信念。我们谈论这些的时候感到十分高兴和骄傲，帝国主义者们也不得不咬牙切齿地承认这个事实。
    亲爱的同志们：
    我们在你们的国家里度过了难忘的日子。我们所看到的一切，我们同中国劳动人民的会见，他们对我们表现的兄弟般的热爱，和在你们国家里进行着的热情而辛勤的劳动，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。我们感到，通过我们这次访问，和刚才签字的友好合作条约，我们之间的友好和同志关系已经变得更加亲密和深入。我们认为，今后我们将能够合作得更加紧密，在政治、经济和文化等各方面将能够更好地互相支持。
    我们向你们保证，我们将把在这里度过的富有经历的日子和我们取得的经验忠实地报告给我国的劳动人民，并且把你们委托转达的千万个问候交给他们。
    我提议：为毛泽东同志，刘少奇同志，朱德同志，周恩来同志和中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导人的健康，干杯！
    匈中两国人民的永恒的友谊万岁！
    伟大的和平堡垒——以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
