They Fear Chinese Shrimp
Chi Bei'ou Poem, Fang Cheng Illustration

Foreign news agencies report: A batch of shrimp from China destined for Canada had to pass through the United States, but was rejected by the US government, on the grounds that it "threatened US security." Chinese shrimp are not allowed to pass through! Raw, cooked, and refrigerated, all are forbidden. How can the democratic and free land of America give convenience to the aquatic products of the communists? Look how similar they are to sickles, clearly a symbol of the Communist Party; look how red they are all over, undoubtedly thoroughgoing red elements. Absolutely no politeness can be shown to these passers-by, otherwise US security will be jeopardized. Who can guarantee that they don't carry subversive plans? Who can guarantee that they don't carry secret weapons? Don't laugh at us for fearing Chinese shrimp, what we fear is China's strength. Our "embargo" cannot stop its increasing development, nor can it prevent its goods from traveling all over the world. (Attached picture)

    他们害怕中国对虾
    池北偶诗  方成图
    外国通讯社报道：一批从中国运往加拿大的对虾，要打美国过境，竟遭美国政府拒绝，理由是“威胁美国安全”。中国对虾，不准过境！生的、熟的、冷藏的一律不行。美利坚民主自由的国土，怎能给共产党的水族方便？你瞧它们长得和镰刀多么相似，这分明是共产党的标志；你瞧它们全身通红，都是些十足的赤党无疑。万万不能对这批过客客气，否则美国安全就会被危及。谁敢保它们没带有颠复计划？谁敢保它们没带有秘密武器？别耻笑我们害怕中国对虾，我们怕的是中国的强大，我们的“禁运”禁不住它的日益发展，也阻不了它的商品走遍天下。（附图片）
