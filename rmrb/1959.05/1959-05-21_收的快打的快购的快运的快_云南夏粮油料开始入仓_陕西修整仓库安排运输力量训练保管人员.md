    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 20th – The work of requisitioning summer harvest crops in Yunnan Province is progressing very quickly, and in many places, the requisitioned grain and oil-bearing crops have begun to enter warehouses in large quantities. According to statistics from the last few days, more than 3,680,000 jin of spring grain crops have been put into storage throughout the province, and more than 4,510,000 jin of rapeseed have been purchased. Yuxi Prefecture, which is progressing faster, has already completed more than half of the state requisitioning task.
    Yunnan Province's summer harvest crops such as wheat, barley, and rapeseed have had a bumper harvest this year, and these crops have been coming onto the market in large quantities. At present, the Party committees in many areas have assigned a secretary to be responsible for the work, combining the distribution of spring crops with the arrangement of seeds, rations, and feed, specifically deploying the requisitioning and warehousing preparation work, and assigning tasks to each commune and management area. The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture has prepared warehouses capable of holding 110 million jin of summer grain. People's communes along the roads are organizing ox carts and horse carts according to their tasks, simultaneously harvesting, threshing, and putting grain into storage; communes in mountainous areas are organizing large teams of oxen and horses to transport grain.
    Yuxi Prefecture, the main producing area of spring grain crops and rapeseed in the province, is reasonably arranging labor while focusing on rice transplanting, rushing to harvest summer crops in the early morning and late evening, with temporary threshing grounds all over the fields, achieving fast harvesting, fast threshing, fast purchasing, and fast transportation. Yuxi County in this prefecture has already put 2,270,000 jin of rapeseed into storage, completing 55.8% of the task; and three communes have enthusiastically sold surplus rapeseed, exceeding their tasks. In many communes in Qujing Prefecture, members are transporting grain overnight; cadres of the grain departments are accepting grain as it arrives, speeding up the warehousing progress. Xiaojie Commune alone put 50,000 jin of grain into storage in one night. More than a dozen ethnic minorities, including the Hani and Yi peoples, on both sides of the Hong River, are working day and night in the fields, carefully harvesting and threshing, and enthusiastically handing over the public grain from the first large-scale planting of wheat and other crops.
    Recently, the Yunnan Provincial Finance and Grain Departments held a business meeting of the grain departments, and through summarizing the experience of last year's requisitioning work, carefully inspected warehouse capacity and other work, and effectively made it convenient for the masses everywhere to quickly complete the requisitioning and warehousing tasks.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th – Various places in Shaanxi Province are actively repairing granaries to prepare for the summer grain and oil requisitioning and warehousing work. Fourteen counties, including Pucheng and Dali, have built more than 9,600 warehouses, many of which have been disinfected. Many communes in Weinan, Qianxian, Ziyang and other places have held special meetings to arrange specific issues in the grain requisitioning work, such as the organization of labor and livestock, road repair and grain transportation. In addition, people's communes in various parts of the province have also trained a group of grain keepers.
    Party and government leaders at all levels in Shaanxi Province attach great importance to the summer grain and oil requisitioning work. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee recently convened a provincial financial and trade secretaries meeting to fully study and discuss the completion of this year's summer grain and oil requisitioning work, and made specific arrangements. Each county also established a summer harvest and requisitioning office led by the first secretary of the county party committee in early May, and organized summer requisitioning work teams to go to various places to help. In order to facilitate farmers to send grain to the warehouse, more than 200 additional purchasing points have been set up throughout the province, and grain, commercial and railway transportation departments have also worked closely together. At present, a large number of packaging and storage materials such as sacks, mats, and tents have been continuously transported to grain purchasing locations.

    陕西修整仓库安排运输力量训练保管人员
    本报昆明20日电　云南省征购夏收作物工作进展很快，许多地方征购的粮食油料，已经开始大量入仓。最近几天统计，全省小春粮食作物入库三百六十八万多斤，收购了油菜籽四百五十一万多斤。进度较快的玉溪专区，目前已完成国家征购任务的一半多。
    云南省今年的小麦、大麦、油菜等夏收作物获得了丰收，这些作物已经陆续大量登场。目前，许多地区的党委，都分工由一个书记负责，结合小春分配工作和种籽、口粮、饲料的安排，具体地部署了征购和入仓准备工作，并把任务分配到各个公社和管理区。楚雄彝族自治州已经准备好可容夏粮一亿一千万斤的仓库，沿公路的各个人民公社，都根据自己的任务，组织好牛车马车，边收边打、边入库；山区的公社正组织牛马运粮大队。
    全省小春粮食作物和油菜主要产区的玉溪专区，在以插秧为中心的同时，合理的安排了劳动力，早晚突击收割夏收作物，满田遍野都是临时打场，做到了收快、打快、收购快，运送快。这个专区的玉溪县，已经入库了油菜籽二百二十七万斤，完成任务的55.8％；并有三个公社踊跃的售出了多余的油菜籽，超额完成了任务。曲靖专区很多公社的社员，连夜运送粮食；粮食部门的干部，随到随收，加快了入仓进度。仅小街一个公社一天晚上就入仓了五万斤粮食。红河两岸的哈尼族、彝族等十多种少数民族，日夜苦战在田间，精收细打，踊跃缴售第一次大量种植小麦等作物的公余粮。
    最近，云南省财粮部门，召开了粮食部门的业务会议，通过总结去年征购工作的经验，认真地检查仓容等各项工作，切实做到处处便利群众，迅速完成征购入库任务。
    新华社西安20日电　陕西省各地正积极整修粮仓，准备迎接夏季粮食油料征购入仓工作。蒲城、大荔等十四个县已修建了九千六百多座仓库，其中很多仓库还进行了消毒工作。渭南、乾县、紫阳等地的许多公社都专门召开会议，对粮食征购工作中的具体问题，如劳畜力组织、修补道路和运粮工作等作了安排。此外，全省各地的人民公社还训练了一批粮食保管员。
    陕西省各地党政领导部门对夏季粮食油料征购工作都十分重视。中共陕西省委最近曾召开全省财贸书记会议，对完成今年夏粮、油料征购工作进行了充分的研究和讨论，并且作了具体的布置，各县也都在5月初成立了由县委第一书记领导的夏收夏征办公室，组织了夏征工作队分赴各地帮助工作。为了便利农民送粮入库，全省各地还增设了二百多个收购点，粮食、商业和铁路运输部门也都密切配合，目前已经将大量的麻袋、席子、帐篷等包装、储存用的各种物资源源运往粮食收购地点。
