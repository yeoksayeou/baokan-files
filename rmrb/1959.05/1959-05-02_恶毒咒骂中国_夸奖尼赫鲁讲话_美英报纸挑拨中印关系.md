Xinhua News Agency, May 1st -- American and British bourgeois newspapers continue to applaud Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the Tibet issue in the Indian People's Assembly on April 27.

    The "Washington Post" editorial on April 30 said that just as Beijing was fiercely accusing India of instigation, Nehru made a "statement of facts" and expressed "regret" for China's use of "Cold War language," thus India has already "taken sides."

    The editorial said that in Sino-Indian relations, Nehru sometimes pursued "double standards" in the past. But due to "some sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels, Nehru this time "has deliberately turned the other cheek," and "this cheek is now being slapped."

    The editorial provoked Sino-Indian relations with viciously slanderous language against China, saying, "Beijing's anger at (India) granting asylum to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugees shows the seriousness of the Tibetan rebellion, which can only show that China is extremely fierce and brutal. This is an Asian nation being suppressed by other Asians operating under the banner of communism, and its significance lies especially in the criticism of India's humanitarian role."

    The "New York Daily News" also published an editorial on the same day, viciously cursing China and inciting India to abandon "neutralism." The editorial alarmistically said, "We don't know if Indian Prime Minister Nehru can learn anything (from the Tibet incident)," if Nehru continues to maintain "neutrality" in East-West relations in the future, "then he can indeed learn nothing and will invite Communist China to eventually conquer the entire India."

    The "Christian Science Monitor" published a report from Bombay on the 28th. The report said that India "is currently opening the first official refugee camp in the Kameng area of Assam Province, accommodating five thousand Tibetans. This is the way India is taking, telling Communist China that it still believes that the Tibetan rebellion is national in nature, rather than incited by a small group of reactionary elements who fear reform."

    Following other British bourgeois newspapers, the British magazine "New Statesman" praised Nehru's speech on April 30, saying that the speech was "wise." "With this frank speech, Mr. Nehru has cleared himself of the widespread accusations made by the East and West against him since the Suez and Hungarian events."

### 恶毒咒骂中国　夸奖尼赫鲁讲话  美英报纸挑拨中印关系

    恶毒咒骂中国　夸奖尼赫鲁讲话
    美英报纸挑拨中印关系
    新华社1日讯　美英资产阶级报刊继续为印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院发表的关于西藏问题的讲话喝采。
      “华盛顿邮报”4月30日的社论说，正当北京激烈指责印度进行煽动的时候，尼赫鲁做了一次“事实的说明”，并且对中国使用“冷战的语言”表示“遗憾”，这样，印度就已经“偏袒一方”。
    社论说，在中印关系上，尼赫鲁过去有时是奉行“双重道德标准”的。但是由于对西藏叛乱分子的“某些同情”，尼赫鲁这次“已经故意把面颊的另一边也转过来了”，“这一面颊现在被人家打了。”
    社论以恶毒诽谤中国的语言挑拨中印关系说，“北京对（印度）给予达赖喇嘛和西藏难民避难权所表示的愤怒说明了西藏叛乱的严重性，这只能表明中国是十分凶狠残暴的。这是一个亚洲民族遭到另一些在共产主义旗帜下活动的亚洲人的镇压，它的意义特别在于对印度人道主义作用的批评。”
      “纽约每日新闻”同一天也发表社论，恶毒地咒骂中国，并且煽动印度放弃“中立主义”。社论危言耸听地说：“我们不知道印度总理尼赫鲁（在西藏事件中）是否能学到任何东西”，如果尼赫鲁以后在东西方关系中继续保持“中立”的话，“那么他的确不能学到任何东西、而且还会招来共产党中国最后征服整个印度。”
      “基督教科学箴言报”28日刊载了一篇发自孟买的报道。这篇报道说，印度“目前在阿萨姆省卡门地区开办了第一个正式难民收容所，收容了五千名西藏人，这就是印度采取的方式，它告诉共产党中国它仍旧认为，西藏叛乱是民族性质的，而不是由一小撮害怕改革的反动分子煽动的。”
    英国“新政治家”杂志4月30日继其他英国资产阶级报刊之后为尼赫鲁的讲话捧场说，这个讲话是
  “明智的”。“由于这篇坦率的讲话，尼赫鲁先生已经洗清了自从苏伊士和匈牙利事件以来东西方对他进行的广泛的责难。
