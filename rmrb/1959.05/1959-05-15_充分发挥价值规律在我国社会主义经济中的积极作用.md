    Fully Develop the Positive Role of the Law of Value in China's Socialist Economy
    Wang Yanan

    I. One of the Main Keys to the Controversy

    Up to now, almost every argument about the law of value and its role in China's economic circles has had quite different or even completely opposite views. It is a healthy phenomenon of free debate to see different opinions and express their own opinions on this issue of great theoretical and practical significance. But in order not to make the argument too extensive and without a home, I think it would be beneficial to explore the main keys of the dispute.

    Based on my experience in reading relevant papers from various parties, it seems that one of the main keys that has caused the controversy is that the understanding of the law of value itself is still quite inconsistent. Starting from here, there cannot be a unified opinion on the role of the law of value in the capitalist economy, its role in our socialist economy, and even how to grasp and apply it to serve our socialist planned economy.

    For the convenience of explanation, I would like to summarize several relevant arguments below:

    1. Many comrades, consciously or unconsciously, regard the law of value as a special product of capitalism, only see the role of the law of value from the free competition and anarchic state of production in capitalism, and simply believe that it only plays a negative and destructive role. Is this really the case?

    2. Precisely because the law of value is regarded as a special product of capitalism and its role is considered only from a negative perspective, people naturally oppose planned economy to the law of value when they talk about socialist planned economy, thinking that planned economy is not only to curb the role of the law of value, but also the result of having curbed the role of the law of value; within the field of planned economy, the law of value is powerless and unwelcome. Is this really the case?

    3. Since the garden of planned economy does not allow the "capitalist" law of value's pig snout to stretch in, the result is naturally: all means of production produced in accordance with the national plan and mutually allocated and distributed within state-owned enterprises, whether they are produced and how much they must be produced, there is absolutely no room for the law of value to intervene; the only role it can play is for those consumer goods that are not fully included in the national plan and need to be circulated in the market. Is this really the case?

    4. Since the law of value is allowed to play a role in the entire national economy only within an extremely limited narrow field, as some economists pointed out, only within the scope of 20 to 20-odd percent of commodity production and circulation activities that are not included in the national plan, it is tantamount to making such a judgment: all direct producers, workers, peasants, and even general employees who are active in the field of planned economy, seem to have no reaction to the state of market supply and demand, the profits and losses of enterprises, and the changes in prices; and it seems that they strive to realize the national plan with great enthusiasm and initiative without considering how those plans are related to the material interests of the country, the collective, and individuals. Is this really the case?

    I think that none of the above points are facts, or not completely facts.

    The real role of the law of value is not manifested in causing the negative destruction of the anarchic state of production, as we have always seen in connection with capitalist commodity production, but rather in its positive role in improving labor productivity and promoting production.

    The law of value and planned economy are not incompatible. It is a good helper to the socialist basic economic law and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy; it is subordinate to the former to play a role. In making plans and implementing plans, we must seriously consider the role of the law of value.

    Considering the organic activities of the national economy as a whole, the role that the law of value may play in specific economic conditions and on different occasions does have differences in size, depth, and scope, but it does not seem to be "a priori" strictly distinguished beforehand in a mutually exclusive manner. Finally, the application of the law of value is not only a matter for economic decision-makers, economic workers, and economists. In the socialist system, since the workers and peasants who directly participate in production are the masters of their own affairs, and since their individual material interests are combined with the interests of the state and the collective, their response to the role of the law of value should be said to be very sensitive.

    I will explain this issue separately below. According to the logical order, we must first have a correct understanding of the law of value and its role.

    II. Re-understanding the Law of Value and its Role

    The basic form of the law of value put forward by our revolutionary teacher Marx is: the amount of socially necessary labor determines the value of commodities. ① In fact, the basic role of the law of value is also manifested here. It contains huge positive significance. As a law, its role is manifested in the requirements or tendencies or the objective social coercive force shown through certain conditions. The value of commodities must be determined by the average socially necessary labor amount, that is, whether the amount of labor you spend in production is more or less, above or below the average necessary labor amount, you will only get or will get the same evaluation. In this way, spending more labor will suffer losses, and spending less labor will gain advantages, and the result will be an invisible urging of everyone to try to reduce the consumption of labor in production in various ways. Therefore, this form of the law of value means the division between advanced and backward; in our current language, it is the objective social coercive force to strive for advancement and catch up with the advanced, and the so-called advanced quotas and advanced average quotas are all embodied through this form. The equivalent exchange of commodities is based on this, and in principle, it is also the requirement to ensure the quality and specifications of product allocation and distribution and the benchmark for distribution according to work.

    In addition to the basic form of the law of value, Marx also put forward a more inclusive and profound supplementary form, that is, "the amount of value of a commodity is directly proportional to the amount of labor realized in it, and inversely proportional to the productivity of the labor realized in it." ② That is to say, to make the labor consumed in production less than the average socially necessary amount, there is only one way, which is to improve labor productivity or increase production efficiency. He also clearly pointed out: "The productivity of labor depends on many things, among which are the average degree of proficiency of the workers, the degree of development of science and its technical application, the social combination of the production process, the scope and effectiveness of the means of production, and various natural conditions." ③ This means that to improve labor productivity and reduce the amount of labor consumed in a product, we can only start from these aspects.

    However, these two forms alone seem to be difficult to fully show that the reason why people desperately reduce the amount of labor consumption of their own products in production is to realize the same or greater value in circulation, in the exchange process, with those products that consume more labor. That is to say, the reason why people's enthusiasm for continuously improving labor production efficiency and reducing labor consumption can be brought into play within the production process is because the quality of their labor activities within the production process must be evaluated in the production process outside or in circulation relations, and must be tested in equivalent exchange. This is an attribute shared by various commodities to varying degrees. However, its manifestation shows extremely essential differences because of the different social production relations, the different relations between the ownership and use of the means of production and labor, and the different conditions of product ownership and distribution. The characteristics of capitalist commodity production are manifested from here. The separation of the means of production from the direct producers and the transformation of labor into commodities have transformed the commodity production process as a unity of the labor process and the value formation process into the capitalist commodity production process as a unity of the labor process and the value appreciation process. Marx especially used the form "the law of value dominates the movement of prices" ④ to express how the law of value, under the conditions of capitalist commodity production, leads to the entire process of white-hot competition and the anarchic state of production through spontaneous action, through the fluctuation of prices around the center of value. The result of capitalists competing fiercely with each other and trying to exploit laborers to reduce labor consumption has indeed greatly improved social labor productivity, but the fundamental contradiction between individual ownership and the social nature of production has more profoundly and clearly exposed its negative destructive role. Many of our economic theorists and economic practitioners may have seen the role of the law of value here.

    However, this must be clearly distinguished. The characteristics of the law of value that are common to commodity production in all social forms are not manifested as negative, but as positive, and its basic role is to promote production. Only under the special conditions of capitalist commodity production, while promoting production, does it have a serious negative destructive effect. If we carefully study Marx's explanation procedure on the law of value, we can also understand this difference to some extent. The most basic form of the law of value mentioned above: the amount of socially necessary labor determines the value of commodities, and the most inclusive form: "the amount of value of a commodity is directly proportional to the amount of labor realized in it, and inversely proportional to the productivity of the labor realized in it," both reflect a positive role. Marx referred to these two expressions when studying small commodity production. As for the form "the law of value dominates the movement of prices," it indicates that it requires a more developed capitalist commodity economy foundation. Obviously, under the conditions of small commodity production, production is still generally to meet the needs of direct producers and their families, and is still for use value. He takes some of his products to the market, and still sells for buying; this process lasted for a long time, and small producers gradually felt the benefits of exchange. He was urged to further divide labor, or change from sideline to main business, and then to specialization, until many related professions were combined into co-operation, which is close to the edge of capitalist commodity production. However, before the emergence of this new historical situation, the conditions for the law of value to spontaneously cause serious socio-economic crises have not yet been formed, and its destructive role is not significant. We only see its positive role in continuously promoting production.

    If it is said that under the conditions of small commodity production in preparation for the conditions of capitalist commodity production, because the means of production and direct producers are basically unified, the law of value here more often manifests the positive role of promoting production, then in our socialist commodity production form transformed from the foundation of capitalist commodity production, due to the public ownership of the means of production, and the realization of planned economy, the law of value is no longer regarded as a major or basic economic law that governs general economic activities as in the capitalist economy, but as an auxiliary means subordinate to the socialist basic economic law or the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, so our main problem today is not how to prevent its negative destructive role, but how to maximize its positive role in promoting production.

    III. How does the Law of Value Play a Role in China's Socialist Economic Life and Economic Policy Activities?

    Since the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in 1956, socialist production relations have been fully established, and the emergence of people's communes last year has further developed socialist economic life.

    The characteristic of the socialist economy is its plan. Superficially, planned economy and commodity production are incompatible; many people do think so, thinking that planned economy is competing with commodity production for territory, and the expansion of planned economy is the reduction of commodity production. However, after the emergence of people's communes in our country, although the possibility of including agricultural production in the national plan has increased, commodity production has not decreased as a result, on the contrary, "in a necessary historical period in the future, the commodity production of people's communes, as well as the commodity exchange between the state and communes, and between communes, must have a great development" ⑤. It can be seen that socialist commodity production does not conflict with planned economy. It is a component of planned economy. At the same time, on the other hand, planned economy can only exist and be realized under socialist production relations. It does not allow, and in fact does not have the conditions to allow the law of value to spontaneously cause negative destructive effects, but despite this, it provides a broad space for the positive role of the law of value. This can be said from two aspects:

    First, the form of the law of value that the amount of average socially necessary labor determines the value of commodities, in the planned economy, whether it is the advanced quota or using the advanced average quota as the benchmark for formulating production indicators, those indicators are generally able to be achieved or overfulfilled. Where is its guarantee? It lies in the fact that the direct producers who realize the production plan are also the national or collective owners of labor products. Because they do not work under the whip and supervision of capitalists to pursue super profits for capitalists, but actively work for the material interests of the state, the collective, and themselves, their labor results can directly give them production incentives. If production technology and labor methods are improved, it will not become a terrible pressure for laborers to be mechanically expelled and alienated as in capitalist society, on the contrary, it will become a reliable guarantee for them to improve labor conditions and create more and faster social and personal wealth. Here, there are no exploiting classes ambushing, laying out suspicious formations, or engaging in speculation and sabotage, and the cost price or production price can quite accurately reflect the value; the monetary income of direct producers can more directly reflect the quality of their labor. This situation is not only conducive to the country's execution of price policies, to determine what kind of price benchmarks or parities should be used to better encourage the labor enthusiasm of producers; it is also conducive to our working people to consider how to increase production efficiency when accepting national tasks, so as to accelerate the accumulation of national wealth and increase personal material interests. The basic key to our ability to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way lies here.

    Second, our socialist economic planning tasks are basically determined according to the socialist basic economic law and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. It not only stipulates rapidly growing production indicators, but also stipulates rapidly improving productivity levels. Without improving productivity levels, it will be difficult to complete production indicators. But how can we improve productivity levels while completing the predetermined production indicators? Mobilizing the enthusiasm of producers and exploring all potential forces mentioned above is of decisive significance, but the plan itself must be based on economic principles, and must be comprehensive, reasonable, practical, and effective. In such occasions, the conscious mastery and application of the law of value is very necessary. At the same time, due to the planned nature of socialist production, there is no contradiction between individual ownership and the social nature of production, and it does not need to realize the value of its products through competition. It basically does not need to constantly increase or decrease its production scale or change its production direction with the changes in market supply and demand and the ups and downs of prices, so it will not lose freedom and lose direction in the so-called free competition, that is to say, it will not suffer from the spontaneous movement of the law of value, but instead has a greater possibility of consciously mastering and applying the law of value.

    The facts also tell us this. To give a few simple examples:

    A careful inspection of our completed and overfulfilled first five-year plan will show that whether it is about industrial or agricultural production plans, specific measures to realize those plans are proposed separately, such as repeatedly emphasizing in the industrial sector "greatly improving the technical level of workers and technicians, further improving the quality of products and increasing the quantity of products," "strengthening cooperation in production, universally promoting contracts between enterprises and internal contracts within enterprises," "strengthening the planning of the combination of production, raw material supply, and product sales," "further improving the management level of enterprises," "constantly paying attention to improving the political awareness of the broad masses of workers and staff, and fully developing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses... rationalization proposals for improving labor organization and working methods, to constantly solve the central problem of industrial enterprise production that is related to improving labor productivity, improving quality, and reducing costs"...etc. ⑥, and in the agricultural sector, emphasizing "according to the actual needs of the local area and the voluntary principle of the masses," "effectively utilizing the land," "strengthening the demonstration role of local state-owned farms in agricultural production. Local state-owned farms must, on the basis of rectification and consolidation, earnestly improve business management, carry out diversified production, and implement economic accounting systems in accordance with the characteristics of agricultural production, so as to achieve the goals of increasing yields, reducing costs, and eliminating waste"...etc. ⑦, almost none of which is not required to strive to economize expenses, reduce costs, and improve labor productivity through the enthusiasm and creativity of direct producers and technical managers. If these are linked to the state's price policy, wage policy, and credit policy, we know that the law of value is being widely used, and in fact, it is also widely playing a positive role.

    For example, the "nation as a single chessboard" call recently put forward by the Party Central Committee requires centralized leadership, unified arrangements, and guarantees of key points. Strengthening cooperation, highlighting the steel, coal, grain, and cotton indicators that must be strived for in 1959, uniformly arranging capital construction projects, uniformly arranging the production of major products, uniformly allocating raw materials, and uniformly allocating and purchasing major materials in the two major categories. Here, the planned nature is greatly strengthened, and it seems that there is even less room for the law of value to play a role, or that this has not considered the law of value at all. Is this really the case? The People's Daily clearly pointed out in the February 24th editorial "The Nation as a Single Chessboard": "Between regions, between departments, between enterprises... In the case of insufficient raw materials, regions with poor construction conditions should give way to regions with better conditions, because the rapid development of these regions can not only rapidly improve the national economic strength, but also give greater help to regions with poor conditions now. Projects that cannot play a role temporarily should give way to projects that can play a role immediately; projects that the state does not urgently need temporarily should give way to projects that the state urgently needs. Similarly, enterprises with relatively low production efficiency, high costs, and poor quality should give way to enterprises with relatively high production efficiency, low costs, and good quality." This is a specific measure to realize "the nation as a single chessboard." In capitalist society, whether a project is needed or not is determined by the market supply and demand relationship; whether an enterprise is advanced or not is eliminated by competition, while we use planning to arrange it. Of course, this arrangement is basically made according to the requirements of the socialist basic economic law, but it is also the result of highly developing economic principles from a national perspective and fully considering the positive role of the law of value.

    Furthermore, the realization of the planned tasks formulated by the state relies on state-owned enterprises in industry and people's communes in agriculture. After the planned tasks are issued to them, they must also concretize them according to the principles of the specific measures indicated in the national plan; they must arrange the planned tasks to workers, technicians, or commune members for discussion according to a certain procedure, and then rearrange them. Whether the arrangement is reasonable or not, whether economic principles have been taken care of, and whether the role of the law of value has been considered will soon be tested by the enthusiasm of the masses. Yes, according to the law of value, the stimulus for striving for advancement and catching up with the advanced in the production process comes from the reaction of the products in the circulation process; most of the products of our state-owned enterprise sector, and even a large part of the agricultural products produced by people's communes as commodities, are produced according to supply contracts, and the allocation supply prices are also predetermined. Here, it seems that the role of the law of value is either completely absent or completely insignificant. Realizing value is not a problem, and buying and selling is just a formality. However, because the same type of enterprises are scattered across the country, the products they provide, no matter how they are allocated and supplied, are compared with each other in terms of quotas, costs, quality, specifications, etc., and there are requirements for invisible competition or evaluation; moreover, the products of a certain enterprise sector may be the raw materials produced by other sectors, and if its quotas cannot be completed, the cost is too high, or the specifications do not meet the requirements, it will become an obstacle for other sectors to complete their planned tasks. Therefore, the mutual allocation of products between various enterprise sectors, even if there is a price but no payment is required, and there are exchange procedures but the owner is not changed, looks formal, but in fact, there is a very substantial requirement, and there should be a more strict joint responsibility relationship than the implementation of buying and selling, and there is a coercive force that can arouse people to go all out and complete the task in a faster, better, and more economical way. As for the price issue in contracts signed between state-owned enterprises, it is not as people imagine that it is just the conversion of statistical figures, and it does not matter much whether it is set higher or lower, but in reality, it is not the case at all. If the product price is not set reasonably, and there is no appropriate connection with the amount of labor and value spent, or if the actual supply and demand situation is not taken into account, it will have a strong reaction in the completion of planned tasks by various enterprises. These situations in state-owned enterprises apply to people's communes to a certain extent. However, since people's communes are established on the basis of collective ownership, they have many types of products, and the parity between agricultural products and industrial products, and the parity between the first, second, and third categories of agricultural products have always been issues of great concern to farmers.

    In short, whether in the economic life of our general people or in the economic policy activities of the state; whether in the field of circulation or in the field of production, the law of value has been playing a role in one way or another, or big or small. However, a product can be used as a means of consumption or as a means of production; a state-owned enterprise sector that produces means of production can supply its products to other state-owned enterprise sectors, and sometimes it will sell it to people's communes; a state-owned enterprise sector that produces means of consumption can sell its products to the members of people's communes, and can also buy them for the staff of the state and state-owned enterprise sectors; some agricultural products produced by some people's communes are used for self-sufficiency, and some must still be sold. The objects it sells to can be other people's communes, or members of other units within this people's commune, or the staff of the state and state-owned enterprises. Their interrelationships are quite complicated. I say this not to obliterate or disrupt the characteristics of them as two types of ownership and two major categories of products. I just show that to strictly define the boundary of the role of the law of value in their production and circulation, I don't know if it is completely in line with reality. According to my very immature idea, we seem to have to say this: our socialist national economy is a whole, and all our social products still have to use value, currency, and prices to determine the size of the socially necessary labor amount they spend, to determine their costs, and to determine the parities of their mutual exchange and distribution. It is impossible for the law of value not to play a role in it; but under our socialist planned economy conditions, it is not easy for it to spontaneously cause destructive effects.

    The question is how to better develop its positive role.

    IV. Our Current Problem is to Correctly Understand the Party's Principles and Policies by Combining the Discussion of Commodity Production and the Law of Value, and to Explore All Effective Measures that Help to Develop the Positive Role of the Law of Value to Rapidly Improve Social Productivity

    Having said this, I have said all I want to say. What needs to be briefly supplemented here is that applying the real role of the law of value that I have emphasized to our society may still be countered by this: Then, in the socialist planned economy, will the law of value really be "all is well" and not have any negative destructive effects? Even if it does not cause the negative destructive effects of seriously causing the anarchic state of production and causing surplus crises as in capitalist society, is there no possibility of causing disturbance to plans, disconnections, and waste in individual occasions? In agricultural cooperatives, people's communes, and even in state-owned enterprise sectors, the phenomenon of not earnestly implementing plans and sacrificing the interests of the large collective to achieve the interests of the small collective in order to pursue greater profits does exist individually, and newspapers and periodicals sometimes reflect and expose it, and there is no need to quote it here. I believe that the occurrence of such things, in addition to the most important political failure and the failure of ideological work to keep up, from an economic point of view, should be said to be due to the fact that the plan is not comprehensive or thorough enough or does not take economic principles into account, and we must attach importance to the following work from a positive aspect in order to avoid the above-mentioned adverse phenomena, and it is conducive to developing the positive role of the law of value:

    1. To formulate plans, especially to concretize the national plan and implement it, we must fully grasp various resource survey materials, and do it in accordance with economic principles and in accordance with the principles of relevant productivity configuration under the guidance of a comprehensive perspective.

    2. To implement the national plan, we must attach importance to various relevant data, comprehensively strengthen statistical supervision work, and use the law of value on the basis of quite reliable and effective statistical work.

    3. Strictly follow the principle of distribution according to work, correctly handle the relationship of material interests between the state, the collective, and individuals, and properly arrange the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption. The law of value is a differentialist rather than an egalitarian.

    4. Price policy is closely related to the use of the law of value. It is a test of whether the principle of distribution according to work and the principle of equivalent exchange are respected; in the entire national economic activity, it must make full use of the role of promoting production with the help of tax work, credit work, and currency management work.

    5. Strengthen financial management, strictly implement the economic accounting system, be responsible at all levels, and supervise and check each other; the more reasonable the requirements are, the more strictly the positive role of the law of value can be developed.

    6. Whether it is within state-owned enterprises or between them, or between them and people's communes, or between people's communes, a series of mandatory inspection and appraisal rules and regulations must be formulated for the allocation, distribution, and exchange of products; whether the rules and regulations are reasonable or not depends on whether it is conducive to promoting the development of productivity? Is it encouraging the advanced? Or is it accommodating and condoning the backward?

    Of course, economic work is closely related to political and ideological work. For the convenience of explanation, we have abstracted political and ideological work. Once we return to reality, we know that every stage and every step of our socialist construction is guided by the Party's principles and policies. And the Party's principles and policies are formulated by combining the subjective and objective conditions of our current stage of construction, distinguishing the primary and secondary, and flexibly applying various economic laws. For example, the various measures mentioned above that facilitate the development of the positive role of the law of value are also repeatedly prompted in the Party's various policies and decrees. To develop production by all effective means, to improve social labor productivity, and to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, this is our policy, our general line; and we are also under this requirement to re-understand the law of value and its role. As for whether commodity production is still needed in the advanced stage of communism, and whether the law of value is still needed to improve productivity, that is not a question I want to answer in this article. If there are many opinions on this issue on the forum, and it is necessary to point out here incidentally, then I think that commodity production is a historical form. Our current task is to promote commodity production, use the law of value, to accelerate the development of our social labor productivity, to complete the two transitions faster, and thus to dialectically achieve the result of eliminating commodity production and ending the role of the law of value.

    充分发挥价值规律在我国社会主义经济中的积极作用
    王亚南
    一、论争分歧的主要关键之一
    直到现在为止，我国经济学界关于价值规律及其作用的每一个论点的讨论，几乎都存在着颇不相同甚至完全相反的看法。对于这个有重大理论意义和实践意义的问题，见智见仁，各抒己见，宁是自由论争的健康现象。但为了不使论点拉得过于广泛，以致漫无归宿，我想探究一下论争分歧的主要关键所在，应当不是没有益处的。
    据我阅读各方面有关论文的体会，仿佛引起争论的主要关键之一，是在于对价值规律本身的认识，还颇不一致。从这里出发，对价值规律在资本主义经济中的作用，对于它在我们社会主义经济中的作用，乃至对于如何掌握运用它来为我们社会主义计划经济服务，就不能有一致的意见。
    为了说明的便利，我想在下面概述几个有关的论点：
    1．有不少的同志，在有意无意地把价值规律看成资本主义的特产物，只从资本主义的自由竞争和生产无政府状态去看价值规律的作用，并干脆地认为它只起着消极的破坏的作用。事实真的这样么？
    2．正是由于把价值规律看成是资本主义的特产物，并一味从消极方面去考虑它的作用，于是，人们一谈到社会主义的计划经济，就很自然地把它和价值规律对立起来，以为计划经济不只是要阻遏价值规律的作用，且还是已经阻遏了价值规律的作用的结果；在计划经济领域内，价值规律是无能为力的，是不受欢迎的，事实真是这样么？
    3．既然计划经济的园地不容许那个“资本主义”的价值规律的猪嘴伸进来，其结果自然是：凡属依照国家计划生产出来，而又是在国营企业内部相互调拨分配的生产资料，它是否生产，它究须生产多少，就完全没有价值规律过问的余地；它可能发生一些作用的，只不过是那些没有完全纳入国家计划，而又要在市场流通的消费资料罢了。事实真是这样么？
    4．在整个国民经济中，价值规律被允许发生作用的，既然只限于极其有限的窄狭领域内，如有的经济学者所指出的，只限于没有纳入国家计划中的那百分之二十到二十几的商品生产和流通活动的范围，那就无异在作着这样的断定：凡属在计划经济领域内活动的直接生产者，工农劳动人民乃至一般职工，似乎对于市场的供需状态，企业的盈亏，物价的变动，完全没有什么反应；也似乎他们用极高的热情和极大的积极性来努力实现国家的计划，并没有考虑到那些计划，对于国家，集体和对于个人的物质利益有怎样的关系。事实真是这样么？
    我想，无论就以上的哪一点说，恐怕都不是事实，或不完全是事实。
    价值规律的真正作用，并不像我们一向联系资本主义商品生产所看到的那样，是在引起生产无政府状态的消极破坏方面表现出来，而宁是在它提高劳动生产力，促进生产的积极作用方面表现出来。
    价值规律和计划经济并不是势不两立的。它是社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的一个好助手；它是从属于前者来发生作用的。定计划、执行计划，都不能不认真考虑到价值规律的作用。
    把全国国民经济的有机活动看成一个整体，价值规律在具体的不同经济条件下和在不同的场合可能发生的作用，确有大小，深浅和范围广狭的不同，但似乎并不是彼强此理地在事前就“先验地”严格区分开来的。最后，价值规律的运用，并不仅是经济决策者，经济工作者，经济学者的事。在社会主义制度下，直接参加生产的工农大众既然是当家作主的人，既然他们个人的物质利益和国家集体的利益结合在一起了，他们对于价值规律的作用的反应，应当说是非常敏感的。
    我将要在下面分别交代这个问题。按照逻辑的顺序，先得对价值规律及其作用有一个正确的认识。
    二、关于价值规律及其作用的再认识
    我们的革命导师马克思提出的价值规律的基本形式是：社会必要劳动量决定商品价值。①事实上，价值规律的基本作用，也表现在这里。它包含有巨大的积极意义。作为一个规律，它的作用，就是表现在它通过一定条件所显出的要求或倾向或社会的客观强制力上。商品价值要由社会平均必要劳动量决定，即无论你在生产时所耗费的劳动量是多还是少，是在平均必要劳动量以上，还是在这以下，都只得到或都会得到同一的评价。这样，多费劳动就要吃亏、少费劳动就占便宜，结果就会在无形中敦促着大家去多方地讲求如何在生产中减少劳动的耗费。所以，价值规律的这个形式，就是意味着先进、落后的分野；用我们现在的语言来说，就是争先进赶先进的社会客观强制力，所谓先进定额，先进平均定额，都是通过这个形式体现出来的。商品的等价交换是以此为依据，而在原则上，那也是对产品调拨分配必须保证质量规格的要求和按劳分配的基准。
    马克思除了这个价值规律的基本形式以外，又提出了一个更包括也更有深刻意义的补充形式，即“商品的价值量，与实现在其内的劳动的量成正比例，与实现在其内的劳动的生产力成反比例。”②即是说，要使生产所耗费的劳动，少于社会平均必要量，只有一个办法，就是提高劳动生产力或增进生产效率。他并明确指出：“劳动的生产力，取决于多种事情，就中，有劳动者熟练的平均程度，科学及其技术应用的发展程度，生产过程的社会结合，生产资料的范围及作用能力，和诸种自然状况。”③这就是说，要提高劳动的生产力，要缩减一件产品中耗费的劳动量，就只有从这些方面入手。
    可是，单是这两个形式，似乎还难得充分表明：人们其所以在生产中拚命缩减他们自己的产品的劳动耗费量，就是为了要在流通中，在交换过程中，和那些耗费了较多劳动量的产品实现同样多的或更大的价值。也就是说，在生产过程中其所以能发挥人们不断提高劳动生产效率，缩减劳动耗费量的积极性，就是由于他们在生产过程内部的劳动活动的质量，要在生产过程外部或流通关系中受到评价，要在等价交换上受到考验。这是在不同程度上为各种商品所共同具有的属性。但其表现形式，则因为各种社会的生产关系不同，因生产资料与劳动力的所有与使用的关系不同，因产品的所有与分配的条件不同而显出了极其本质的差别。资本主义商品生产的特点，就从这里表现出来了。生产资料与直接生产者分离开，劳动力也变成了商品，这一来作为由劳动过程与价值形成过程的统一的商品生产过程，就转变到作为由劳动过程与价值增殖过程的统一的资本主义的商品生产过程。马克思特别用“价值法则支配着价格的运动”④这个形式，来表述价值规律如何在资本主义商品生产条件下，由自发作用，由价格围绕价值中心上下波动，而引向白热竞争和生产无政府状态的全部过程。资本家们相互拚命竞争并多方设法剥削劳动者缩减劳动耗费量的结果，社会的劳动生产力确实大大提高了，但个人占有与生产社会性的根本矛盾，却更深刻也更明显地暴露出来了它的消极破坏作用。我们许多经济理论工作者和经济实际工作者，也许就是在这里看到了价值规律的作用。
    然而，这是必须明确地加以区别的。价值规律为一切社会形态的商品生产所共有的特性，并不是表现为消极的，而是表现为积极的，它的基本作用是促进生产，只有在资本主义商品生产的特殊条件下，才在促进生产的同时，发生了严重的消极破坏作用。我们仔细探究一下马克思关于价值规律的说明程序，也多少可以体会到这种区别。前面讲到的价值规律的最基本形式：社会必要劳动量决定商品价值，和最包括的形式：“商品的价值量，与实现在其内的劳动的量成正比例，与实现在其内的劳动的生产力成反比例”，都体现着积极的作用，马克思是在研究小商品生产的时候，述及这两个表达形式的。而对于“价值法则支配着价格的运动”这个形式，则指明它要求一个发达得多的资本主义商品经济的基础。很明显的，在小商品生产条件下，生产一般还是为了满足直接生产者个人及其家属的需要，还是为了使用价值，他有一部分生产物拿到市场上去，也还是为买而卖；这个过程延续了很长一段时间，小生产者逐渐感到交换的好处，他被敦促进一步分工，或者由副业改为主业，再改为专业，以至出现把许多有关的专业结合为协业，这已接近了资本主义商品生产的边缘。但在这个新的历史局面出现以前，价值规律被允许自发地发生严重的社会经济危机的条件也还没有形成，它的破坏作用，还不显著，我们倒只见到它的不断促进生产的积极作用。
    如其说在为资本主义商品生产准备条件的小商品生产的条件下，由于生产资料和直接生产者基本上是统一的，价值规律在这里更多的表现了促进生产的积极作用，那么，在我们从资本主义商品生产基础上变革过来的社会主义商品生产形态下，由于生产资料的公有，由于计划经济的实现，价值规律已不像在资本主义经济中那样，当作一个左右一般经济活动的主要的或基本的经济规律，而是当作一个从属于社会主义基本经济规律或国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的辅助手段，所以我们今天的主要问题，不在如何防止它的消极破坏作用，而是在如何尽可能地发挥它的促进生产的积极作用。
    三、价值规律在我国社会主义经济生活和经济政策活动中在怎样发生作用
    我国自1956年对农业，对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造胜利以后，社会主义生产关系就全面建立起来了，去年人民公社出现，更使社会主义经济生活有了进一步的大发展。
    社会主义经济的特点，就是它的计划性。从表象上看来，计划经济和商品生产是格格不入的；许多人确实是这么想，以为计划经济在和商品生产争地盘，计划经济范围扩大，就是商品生产的缩小。可是，我国出现了人民公社以后，尽管农业生产纳入国家计划的可能性增大了，商品生产却并不因此减少，反之，“在今后一个必要的历史时期内，人民公社的商品生产，以及国家和公社、公社和公社之间的商品交换，必须有一个很大的发展”⑤。可见社会主义的商品生产，并不是和计划经济抵触的。它是计划经济的一个构成部分。同时在另一个方面，计划经济是只有在社会主义生产关系下才有可能存在和实现的。它不容许，实质上也没有具备容许价值规律自发地发生消极破坏作用的条件，可是尽管如此，它却为价值规律的积极性的作用，提供了广阔的活动场所。这可以从两方面来说：
    第一、社会平均必要劳动量决定商品价值，这个价值规律形式，在计划经济中，不论是先进定额，还是用先进平均定额作为制定生产指标的基准，那些指标，一般都是能够实现或超额实现的。它的保证在什么地方呢？就在于实现生产计划的直接生产者，同时就是劳动生产物的全民的或集体的所有者。由于他们不是在资本家鞭策监督下为资本家追求超额利润而劳动，而是主动地为了国家集体和他们个人的物质利益而劳动，他们的劳动成果，就能很直接地给予他们以生产刺激。生产技术劳动方法改进了，不像在资本主义社会那样，会成为劳动者被机械驱逐，被游离出来的可怕压力，反之，却会成为他们改善劳动条件，更多更快地创造社会及个人财富的可靠保证。在这里，没有剥削阶级从中打埋伏，布疑阵，投机捣把，成本价格或生产价格能相当确定地反映价值；直接生产者的货币收入，能比较直接地反映他们的劳动质量。这种情况，不但有利于国家执行价格政策时，要确定用怎样的物价基准或比价，才能更好鼓励生产者的劳动热情；同时也有利于我们劳动人民接受国家任务时，要讲求如何增进生产效率，才能加速积累国家财富和增进个人物质利益。我们能够多快好省地建设社会主义的基本关键，就在这里。
    第二、我们社会主义的经济计划任务，基本上是根据社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划按比例发展规律定出来的。其中不仅规定了迅速增长的生产指标，还规定了迅速提高的生产力水平，生产力水平不提高，生产指标的完成就有困难。但如何能在完成预定生产指标的同时，把生产力水平提高起来呢？上面讲到的调动生产者的积极性，发掘一切潜在力量，是有决定意义的，但计划本身必须建立在经济原则的基础上，必须定得全面，定得合理，定得切实可行，行之有效，在这样的场合，价值规律的自觉掌握运用就非常必要了。同时，由于社会主义的生产计划性，不存在个人占有与生产社会性的矛盾，不要通过竞争来实现其所生产的产品的价值，基本上无须随着市场供需状况变动，随着价格上下的变动，而不断被迫增减其生产规模，或改变其生产方向，从而，就不致在所谓自由竞争中丧失自由，迷失方向，也就是说，不致遭受价值规律自发运动的支配，却反而有更大地自觉掌握运用价值规律的可能了。
    事实也正是这样告诉我们的。举几个简单例子来说吧。
    仔细检查一下我国已经超额完成了的第一个五年计划，就知道其中不论是关于工业或农业的生产计划，都分别提出了如何实现那些计划的具体措施，如在工业方面反复强调“大力地提高工人和技术人员的技术水平，进一步地改善产品的质量和增加产品的数量”，“加强生产中的协作，普遍地推行各企业之间的合同和企业内部的联系合同”，“加强生产、原材料供应同产品销售相结合的计划性”，“进一步地提高企业的管理水平”，“经常地注意提高广大工人职员群众的政治觉悟，充分地发挥群众的积极性和创造性……改善劳动组织和工作方法的合理化建议，来不断地解决提高劳动生产率、提高质量和降低成本这三个方面相互联系的工业企业生产的中心问题”……等。⑥又如在农业方面，强调“根据当地的实际需要和群众的自愿原则”，“有效地利用土地”，“加强地方国营农场在农业生产中的示范作用。地方国营农场必须在整顿巩固的基础上，认真地改善经营管理，进行多种多样的生产，按照农业生产的特点，实行经济核算制，从而达到提高产量、降低成本和杜绝浪费的目的”……等等⑦，几乎没有哪一项不是要求通过直接生产者和技术管理者的积极性创造性来努力撙节开支，降低成本，提高劳动生产率，如果把这些联系到国家执行的价格政策、工资政策、信贷政策来考虑，就知道价值规律在广泛地被利用，并且实际也在广泛地发生积极作用。
    即如最近党中央提出的“全国一盘棋”的号召，要求集中领导，统一安排，保证重点。加强协作，把1959年必须争取实现的钢、煤、粮食、棉花指标突出来，统一安排基建项目、统一安排主要产品的生产、统一分配原材料、统一调拨收购两大部类的主要物资。在这里，计划性显得大大地强化了，似乎更没有价值规律作用的余地，或者说，这末做，根本没有理会什么价值规律。真是这样的么？本年2月24日人民日报在“全国一盘棋”社论中，明确指出：“各地区之间，各部门之间，各企业之间……在原材料不足的情况下，建设条件比较差的地区，要让路给条件比较好的地区，因为这些地区很快发展起来了，不仅能使全国经济力量迅速提高，而且也能给现在条件较差的地区以更大的帮助。暂时不能发挥作用的工程要让路给能够马上发挥作用的工程；国家暂时不迫切需要的工程要让路给国家迫切需要的工程。同样的，生产效率比较低、成本比较高、质量又比较差的企业，要让路给生产效率比较高、成本比较低、质量比较好的企业”。这是实现“全国一盘棋”的具体措施。在资本主义社会，工程需要不需要，是让市场的供需关系去决定去留；企业先进不先进，是让竞争去淘汰，而我们则用计划加以安排。当然，这种安排，基本上是依据社会主义基本经济规律的要求作出的，但同时也是从全国的角度，高度发挥经济原则，充分考虑到价值规律的积极作用的结果。
    再说到国家所制定的计划任务的实现，在工业上是靠国营企业，在农业上是靠人民公社。计划任务下达到它们那里，它们还要根据国家计划方案所指示的具体化措施的原则，而将其实行具体化；它们要按照一定程序，分别把计划任务发交工人技术人员或社员讨论，要再进行安排，安排合理不合理，照顾到了经济原则没有，考虑到了价值规律的作用没有，很快就要在群众的积极性上受到考验。是的，按照价值规律，在生产过程中的争先进赶先进的刺激，是来自流通过程中对于产品的反应；我们国营企业部门的绝大部分的产品，甚至人民公社的很大一部分当作商品生产出来的农产品，都是按供应合同预定生产的，调拨供应价格也预定好了，在这里似乎价值规律的作用，不是完全没有了，就是完全不足道了。实现价值不成问题，买卖只不过是形式。可是，由于在全国范围内，同一类型的企业，散在全国各地，它们所提供出来的产品，不管是通过怎样的调拨供应方式，在定额、成本、质量、规格等方面，相互都有比较，都存在着无形的竞赛或评比要求；而且，某一企业部门的产品，可能就是其他部门生产的原材料，它的定额不能完成，成本太高，或规格不合，就要成为其他部门完成计划任务的障碍。所以，产品在各企业部门之间的相互调拨，即使有价格而并不要实行付款，有交换手续而并没有变更所有者，看起来，是形式的，但其实，在其中存在着一种非常实质的要求，应当有比实行买卖还要严格的联锁责任关系，有能唤起人们鼓足干劲，多快好省地完成任务的强制力量。至于国营企业间签订合同的价格问题，那也并不是像人们想像的那样，以为横竖不过统计数字的换算，定高一点，低一点，没有大关系，但揆诸实际，完全不是那一回事。产品价格定得不合理，没有和所费劳动量、价值量保持适当联系，或太没有照顾到实际供销状况，就将在各企业完成计划任务上发生强烈反应。在国营企业方面的这些情况，在一定限度内，是适用于人民公社的。不过由于人民公社是建立在集体所有制基础上的，它的产品种类甚多，农产品与工业品的比价，第一二三类农业品间的比价，始终都成为农民非常关心的问题。
    总之，不论是在我们一般人民的经济生活中，还是在国家的经济政策活动中；不论是在流通领域，还是在生产领域，价值规律一直在发生这样那样，或大或小的作用。不过一种产品，可以作为消费资料用，也可以作为生产资料用；一个生产生产资料的国营企业部门，可以把它的产品供应给其他国营企业部门，也有时会把它出卖给人民公社；一个生产消费资料的国营企业部门，它的产品会卖给人民公社的社员，也会买给国家及国营企业部门的职工；有些人民公社生产的农产品用以自给，有一些还必须售卖出去，它售卖的对象，可以是其他人民公社，或本人民公社内的其他单位的社员，也可以是国家和国营企业的职工。它们相互间的联系是相当错综复杂的。我这样说，并不是要抹煞或搅乱它们分别作为两种所有制，两大部类产品的特点，我只不过表明，要在它们的生产与流通中间严定价值规律作用的界线，我不知道是否完全合乎实际。照我的很不成熟的想法，我们似乎只好这样说：我们的社会主义国民经济是一个整体，我们所有的社会产品，都还要借助于价值、货币、价格，来确定它们所费社会必要劳动量的大小，来确定它们的成本，确定它们相互交换分配的比价。价值规律不在其中发生作用是不成的；可是在我们社会主义计划经济条件下，它要自发地发生破坏作用也是不容易做到的。
    问题在于怎样更好地把它的积极作用发挥出来。
    四、我们当前的问题，是在结合商品生产与价值规律的讨论，正确认识党的方针政策、探究有助于发挥价值规律的积极作用来迅速提高社会生产力的一切有效措施
    讲到这里，已算把我要讲的话都讲了，需要在这里简单补充的，就是把我所强调的价值规律的真正作用，应用到我们社会，还可能会受到这样的反驳：然则在社会主义计划经济中，价值规律就真的会“万事大吉”，不发生任何消极破坏作用么？即使不会发生像在资本主义社会那样严重地引起生产无政府状态，引起过剩危机的消极破坏作用，也没有在个别场合造成搅扰计划、脱节、浪费的可能么？在农业社、人民公社、甚至在国营企业部门，为了追求较大盈利，不认真执行计划以至牺牲大集体利益来成就小集体利益的现象，确实是个别存在的，报刊不时也有所反映和揭露，这里无须引述。我认为，像这类事情的发生，除了最关重要的政治没有挂帅，思想工作没有跟上之外，就经济上讲，应当说是由于计划定得不全面不周密或太没有照顾到经济原则，必须从积极方面来重视下面这些工作，才能避免发生上述不良现象，而有利于发挥价值规律的积极作用：
    1、订定计划特别是将国家计划具体化，见之于实行，必须充分掌握各种资源调查材料，在全面观点指导下，做得合乎经济原则，合乎有关生产力配置原则。
    2、执行国家计划，必须重视各种有关数据，全面加强统计监督工作，在相当确实而有效的统计工作基础上，运用价值规律。
    3、严格遵循按劳分配原则，正确处理国家，集体与个人之间的物质利益关系，妥善安排积累与消费之间的比例关系，价值规律宁是差别主义者，而不是平均主义者。
    4、价格政策和运用价值规律有密切联系。它是按劳分配原则，等价交换原则是否受到尊重的考验；在整个国民经济活动中，它必须借助于税务工作、信贷工作、货币管理工作，充分发挥促进生产的作用。
    5、加强财务管理，严密经济核算制度，层层负责，相互督促检查；合理的要求愈严格，就愈能发挥价值规律的积极作用。
    6、不论是在国营企业内部或其相互间，还是在它们与人民公社间，或人民公社相互间，对于产品的调拨、分配、交换，必须订定一系列的带有强制性的检查鉴定规章制度；规章制度合理不合理，就看它是有助于促进生产力的发展？是鼓励了先进？还是迁就姑息了落后？
    当然，经济工作是和政治思想工作密切联系着的。为了说明的便利，我们把政治思想工作抽象去了。一回到现实中来，就知道我们进行社会主义建设的每一个阶段、每一个步骤，都是把党的方针政策作为指导。而党的方针政策，又是结合我们现阶段建设的主客观条件，分清主从，灵活运用各种经济规律所制订出来的。即如上面提到的各种便利价值规律发挥积极作用的措施，也正好是在党的各种政策法令中所反复提示了的。用一切有效的办法来发展生产，来提高社会劳动生产力，来多快好省地建设社会主义，这就是我们的方针，我们的总路线；我们也正好是在这种要求下，来重新认识价值规律及其作用的。至于在共产主义高级阶段是否还要商品生产，是否还要运用价值规律来提高生产力，那不是我在本文里面所要回答的问题。如因论坛上对这个问题的意见很多，有必要在这里附带指明一下，那末我认为，商品生产是一个历史形态。我们当前的任务，就是要促进商品生产，利用价值规律，来加速我们社会劳动生产率的发展，更快地来完成两种过渡，因而辩证地达到消灭商品生产、终结价值规律作用的结果。
