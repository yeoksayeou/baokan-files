Comrade Chairman, Fellow Representatives:
    I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
    I resolutely support the government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. And I resolutely oppose imperialism and Indian expansionists using the rebellion of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet to interfere in our internal affairs. I firmly believe that the Tibetan people will definitely be able to, like all ethnic groups in the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, march toward a happy and prosperous socialist society.
    After liberation, our motherland's construction, through three years of recovery and the completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan, has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's correct general line for building socialism, the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton more than doubled compared to 1957. An unprecedented great leap forward in our national economy emerged. The national economic plan for 1959 calls for the main outputs to be about three times those of 1957, which is a massive plan for continued leaps forward. Because our vast numbers of cadres and masses have raised their political consciousness, strengthened their political unity, and implemented the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chessboard, we have the confidence and determination to complete this grand and arduous plan.
    The speed of the leaping progress in the motherland's various construction undertakings over the past decade or so has amazed people all over the world. All these brilliant achievements should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and further confirm the superiority of the socialist system.
 
Our country's shale oil industrial base is increasing, factories are being expanded, and scientific and technological strength is growing.
    Here, I would like to talk about the development of the shale oil industry:
    Since liberation, especially in recent years, the development of the shale oil industry, like other industries, has made leaping progress. Under the Party Central Committee's decision: "To vigorously explore natural petroleum resources, while developing synthetic petroleum, and make long-term and active efforts to develop the petroleum industry," the construction of the shale oil industry is not only carrying out large-scale expansion on the original Fushun shale oil base in Northeast China, but also establishing new shale oil bases in Huadian, Northeast China, and Maoming, South China. In addition, many small and medium-sized shale oil plants are being built across the country. It is planned that after these enterprises are all put into production, our country will become a major country in the production of synthetic petroleum.
    In recent years, in order to develop the shale oil industry in a planned way, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has greatly strengthened its leadership and cultivation work for the Fushun shale oil base in Northeast China. On the one hand, it has continuously carried out large-scale expansion of Petroleum Factories No. 1, 2, and 3 to greatly increase production. On the other hand, it has established large-scale research institutes, design institutes, installation companies, and other units. At the same time, it has established petroleum colleges, secondary technical schools, and technical worker schools to train petroleum professionals, provide technical workers for the blossoming of the petroleum industry all over the country, and replenish reserve forces. At present, the number of petroleum workers in the Fushun area has reached tens of thousands, and this strong team is still expanding.
    In terms of the production level of the shale oil industry, in recent years, great improvements and enhancements have been made to the equipment and operation of the Fushun-style circular dry distillation furnace through vigorously launching mass movements and making great strides in technological revolution. The shale utilization rate has increased from 65 percent to over 90 percent, the processing capacity has exceeded the original design target by about 20 percent, and the oil extraction rate has increased from 60 percent to about 75 percent. According to recent tests, if the operation is well controlled in the original furnace type and process, and the fire layer is controlled or a gas combustion section is added, the oil extraction rate may reach over 80 percent. Currently, all shale oil workers in Fushun are exerting their utmost efforts, doing everything possible to overcome difficulties, and striving to achieve a higher oil extraction rate and obtain a greater output of crude oil as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    In addition, in terms of production technology, in order to fully utilize resources and avoid wasting granular and powdered shale as much as possible, a stacked dry distillation operation method has been adopted. Although it is a simple production method with a large land area and a large labor force, it is still the best way to process granular and powdered shale before the industrialized furnace types for advanced louver type, solid heat carrier type, fluidized bed type, and fluidization type dry distillation furnaces have matured. At present, large-scale industrial production has been carried out in Fushun and Huadian in Northeast China, and a large amount of crude oil has been obtained from the granular and powdered shale that was discarded in the past. This is one of the great achievements obtained under the principle of combining foreign and indigenous methods.
    In shale dry distillation and shale oil processing research, in recent years, in line with production needs, research has been conducted on furnace type improvement, increasing processing capacity, improving oil extraction rate, utilizing granular and powdered shale, recovering by-products from shale dry distillation gas, treating wastewater from the shale dry distillation industry, studying the physical properties and heat treatment of shale, evaluating shale oil, and acid-base refining and hydrorefining of shale oil. This research has reached a certain academic level, and some of it has been applied in production, playing a significant role. Some are undergoing further repeated verification to find better conditions, preparing for design and production innovation.
    Recently, in terms of shale dry distillation furnace types, a new square gas combustion furnace has been created by drawing on the advantages of the Lurgi furnace for low-temperature coal dry distillation. According to preliminary test results, the oil extraction rate can reach 85 percent, which is about 10 percent higher than that of the Fushun-style circular dry distillation furnace, and the processing capacity of a single furnace can reach 300 to 400 tons per day. Currently, due to the low concentration of by-products in the gas and the low calorific value of the gas, it is necessary to combine the advantages of the Fushun-style circular furnace, such as heat circulation and gasification, for further research and improvement. Large and medium-sized industrial tests are now being carried out in the Maoming, Huadian, and Fushun shale oil bases. We believe that this advanced dry distillation furnace type in the world will soon be established in new shale oil plants.
 
Breakthrough technological barriers, develop the shale oil industry, coal liquefaction industry, and comprehensive utilization of coal.
    The shale dry distillation and shale oil processing design work is being carried out by a new force that has been cultivated in our country in the past two or three years. Because the shale dry distillation and shale oil processing industry also lacks mature experience abroad, and the existing shale oil plants in the world are not very large, we cannot completely rely on other people's experience to improve and enhance our country's shale oil industry. We must delve into it ourselves, explore deeply, and find the direction in order to make more advanced design schemes. Under the promotion of the comprehensive great leap forward in 1958, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the selfless labor of all employees, the design tasks of a shale oil plant with an annual output of 1 million tons, a synthetic oil plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons, a low-temperature coal dry distillation plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons, a high-pressure hydrogenation plant for coal tar with an annual output of 100,000 tons, a hydrogenation plant for shale light oil with an annual output of 1 million tons, and many small and medium-sized shale dry distillation and shale oil processing plants have been completed, and certain experiences have been obtained, laying a good foundation for the design of new shale oil plants in our country in the future. In 1958, investments of 290 million yuan and 75,000 tons of steel were saved in all designs, earnestly implementing the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift. However, our technical level is still low and our experience is insufficient, and there are still many specific problems that must be overcome with redoubled efforts in the future, and we must continue to improve and enhance. At present, we should strive to create new furnace types with higher efficiency, determine the most advanced production processes, so as to further reduce costs, reduce investment, improve quality, improve yield and labor productivity, and obtain greater development of the shale oil industry.
    The comprehensive utilization of the shale oil industry is the only way to reduce costs and develop the shale oil industry. According to the current production situation, more than 20 tons of oil shale are required to extract one ton of crude oil. If the comprehensive utilization of the shale oil industry is not carried out well, it is still not very economically advantageous. Therefore, the large amounts of ammonia, light oil, hydrogen sulfide, pyridine, phenol, germanium and other by-products in the shale dry distillation gas must be well recovered and utilized. In addition, the remaining dry distillation gas must be used as fuel gas, and shale ash must be better used as raw materials for cement, so that the products, by-products, and residues after processing oil shale can all be utilized in industry. At the same time, a large amount of diesel can be obtained from shale oil, and its quality is better than that of diesel produced from natural petroleum. In the case of the urgent need for diesel in China's industry, agriculture and transportation industries, the shale oil industry also has its special advantages.
    According to exploration results, our country's oil shale deposits are abundant and widely distributed, unlike natural petroleum which is relatively concentrated. In the future, it will be easy to adjust production and sales according to regional needs, and reduce the difficulties and losses of long-distance transportation. Therefore, even after the large-scale development of natural petroleum in the future, the oil shale industry will still have its significant meaning.
    We must rely closely on the Party, put politics in command, and launch a mass-based campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, strive to continuously improve and enhance the production scale and technical level of the shale oil industry, and create new miracles in the various production and technical battles with the momentum of storming the enemy's position. On the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, we will make persistent efforts to resolutely ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the national crude oil plan in 1959! Strive for greater development of our country's shale oil industry!
    Finally, I would also like to briefly talk about the coal liquefaction industry and the comprehensive utilization of coal. This is another important part of the synthetic petroleum industry, and it has great development prospects in our country, which is particularly rich in coal reserves. If the oil-containing coal can be first dry-distilled to extract oil, the amount will be amazing. At the same time, there are also large amounts of by-products such as benzene, phenol, gas, and coke, which can be used as industrial raw materials and fuel, which has significant meaning in economic construction. In recent years, the coal liquefaction industry and the comprehensive utilization of coal have been valued by the Party Central Committee and the people of the whole country, and new coal liquefaction plants have begun to be built, and scientific research and industrial tests on the comprehensive utilization of coal are being carried out. However, the technical strength is still very weak, and this work must be further strengthened, and multiple technological barriers must be broken through, and more industrial tests must be carried out to create conditions for the large-scale development of the coal liquefaction industry and the comprehensive utilization of coal, and to open up a broader path for the petroleum industry!

    我国页岩油工业飞跃发展
    顾敬心代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告，及李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    我坚决拥护政府对西藏叛乱的平定。并坚决反对帝国主义和印度扩张主义者，利用西藏上层反动分子的叛乱，干涉我国内政。我坚信西藏人民，今后一定能同全国各族人民一样，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，向美满幸福的社会主义社会迈进。
    解放后祖国建设经过三年恢复，和第一个五年计划的完成与超额完成，已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。第二个五年计划的第一年——一九五八年，在党的正确领导建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，钢、煤、粮食和棉花的产量比一九五七年增长了一倍以上。出现了我国史无前例的国民经济大跃进。一九五九年的国民经济计划，主要产量均为一九五七年的三倍左右，是一个巨大的继续跃进计划。由于我们广大干部和群众提高了政治觉悟，加强了政治团结，贯彻了党的多快好省建设社会主义的总路线和全国一盘棋，两条腿走路的方针，我们有信心、有决心，一定能够完成这个宏伟艰巨的计划。
    十来年祖国各项建设事业飞跃进展的速度，为全世界人士所惊奇。这一切辉煌成就，应归功于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，更证实了社会主义制度的优越性。
    我国的页岩油工业基地在增加，工厂在扩建，科学技术力量在壮大
    这里我想谈一谈页岩油工业发展的情况：
    自解放以来，特别是近几年中，页岩油工业的发展和其他工业一样有着飞跃的进展。在党中央决定：“要大力地勘察天然石油的资源，同时发展人造石油，长期地积极地努力发展石油工业”的方针下，页岩油工业的建设，不但在原有东北抚顺页岩油基地上进行大规模的扩建；并另在东北桦甸与华南茂名建立新的页岩油基地。此外还在全国各地建设很多中小型的页岩油厂，计划这些企业全部投入生产后，我国将为人造石油产量巨大的国家。
    几年来，政府为了有计划的发展页岩油工业，石油工业部大大加强了对东北抚顺页岩油基地的领导与培养工作。一方面对石油一、二、三厂不断进行大规模的扩建，大量增产。一方面设立规模巨大的研究所、设计院、安装公司等单位。同时成立了石油学院、中等技校、技工学校，以培养石油专业人才，为全国石油工业遍地开花，输送技术员工，充实后备力量。目前抚顺地区石油工作人员已达三万数千人，这支强大的队伍，还在不断扩展中。
    在页岩油工业的生产水平上，近年来对于抚顺式圆型干馏炉的设备和操作方面，通过大搞群众运动大闹技术革命之后，已有很大的改进与提高。页岩利用率已由百分之六十五提高到百分之九十以上，处理能力已超过原设计指标百分之二十左右，采油率由百分之六十提高到百分之七十五上下，并根据最近试验证明，在原有炉型和流程中掌握好操作，控制好火层或增加了气燃段之后，采油率可能达到百分之八十以上，现抚顺全体页岩油工作者，正鼓足干劲，千方百计，克服困难，为力争达到更高的采油率，获得更大的原油产量，作为国庆十周年的献礼。
    此外在生产技术上，为了充分利用资源，尽量不浪费颗粒与粉末页岩起见，采用了成堆干馏的操作方法。虽然是生产方式简陋，占地面积大，使用劳动力多的一种土办法操作；但在目前先进的百叶窗式与固体热载体式，沸腾床式，流体化式等干馏炉工业化炉型研究试验还没有成熟之前，采用成堆干馏来处理颗粒和粉末页岩还是最好的办法。现在东北抚顺与桦甸已进行大量工业化生产，从过去舍弃的颗粒与粉末页岩中取得了大量的原油，这是在洋土结合方针下，获得的巨大成就之一。
    在页岩干馏和页岩油加工研究工作中，近年来配合生产需要，对炉型改进，加大处理量，提高采油率，颗粒与粉末页岩的利用，页岩干馏气体副产品的回收，页岩干馏工业的污水处理，页岩物理性能和热处理的研究，页岩油的评价，页岩油的酸碱精制与加氢精制等许多研究，具有一定的学术水平，其中部分已在生产上应用，起了不少的作用。部分正在作进一步重复验证，寻找更好的条件，准备供设计和生产上革新采用。
    最近在页岩干馏炉型方面，吸取煤低温干馏鲁奇炉的长处，创造了一种新的方型气燃炉，根据初步试验结果采油率可达百分之八十五，比抚顺式圆型干馏炉的采油率要提高百分之十左右，单炉处理量每天可达三百吨到四百吨。目前限于瓦斯中副产品浓度小，瓦斯热值低，必须结合抚顺式圆型炉利用热循环、气化等优点，作进一步研究和改进。现在在茂名、桦甸、抚顺页岩油基地进行大中型工业化试验，我们相信，这种世界上先进的干馏炉型不久的将来，要在新的页岩油厂中建立起来。
    突破技术关，发展页岩油工业、煤炼油工业和煤的综合利用
    在页岩干馏和页岩油加工设计工作上，是我国最近二、三年间培养起来的一部分新生力量，由于页岩干馏和页岩油加工工业，在国外也缺乏成熟的经验，目前世界上现有的页岩油厂都不很大，因此不能完全依靠人家的经验，来改进和提高我国的页岩油工业，必须自己钻进去，深入摸索，寻找方向，才能作出比较先进的设计方案。在一九五八年全面大跃进的推动下，由于党的正确领导和全体职工忘我劳动的结果，完成了年产一百万吨的页岩油厂，五万吨的合成油厂，十万吨的煤低温干馏厂，十万吨的煤焦油高压加氢厂，一百万吨的页岩轻油加氢厂和许多中小型页岩干馏及页岩油加工厂等设计任务，取得了一定的经验，对我国今后页岩油工业新厂设计，打下了良好的基础。一九五八年在全部设计中节约投资二亿九千万元，节约钢材七万五千吨，认真贯彻了勤俭建国的精神。可是我们的技术水平还低，经验不足，还存在着许多具体问题，必须今后加倍努力，克服困难，不断改进和提高。当前应争取创造更高效率的新炉型，确定最先进的生产流程，使能进一步降低成本，降低投资，提高质量，提高收率与劳动生产率，获得页岩油工业更大的发展。
    页岩油工业的综合利用是降低成本和发展页岩油工业的唯一道路，按照目前生产情况，需用二十吨以上油母页岩才能提炼出一吨原油，如不很好进行页岩油工业的综合利用，则在经济上还是不十分有利的。因此页岩干馏气体中大量的氨、轻质油、硫化氢、吡啶、酚、锗等副产品，必须很好的回收利用。此外剩余的干馏气体，一定要作为燃料气体应用，页岩灰要更好的作为水泥等原料，使油母页岩加工后的产品、副产品、残渣等都能在工业上利用。同时从页岩油中可得到大量的柴油，其质量比天然石油所产的柴油还好。在我国工农业及交通运输业方面迫切需要柴油的情况下，页岩油工业还有其特殊的优越条件。
    根据勘查结果，我国油母页岩矿藏丰富，分布极广，不像天然石油比较集中，将来按地区需要，很易调剂产销，并可减少长途运输的困难与损失。所以即使将来天然石油大量开发之后，油母页岩工业，仍有它重大的意义。
    我们要紧密依靠党，政治挂帅，要开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，争取不断改进和提高页岩油工业的生产规模和技术水平，在各个生产和技术战斗中以冲锋陷阵之势，创造新的奇迹。在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，再接再厉，为坚决保证完成和超额完成一九五九年原油国家计划而奋斗！为我国页岩油工业更大的发展而奋斗！
    最后我还想简单谈一谈煤炼油工业和煤的综合利用问题，这是人造石油工业中另一重要部分，在煤储量特别丰富的我国，是有很大发展前途的。若能把含油的煤，先经干馏提炼出油来，其数量是惊人的。同时还有大量的苯、酚、煤气、焦等副产品，可作工业原料及燃料利用，在经济建设中具有重大的意义。近年来煤炼油工业和煤的综合利用，已为党中央和全国人民所重视，并开始筹建新的煤炼油厂，进行煤的综合利用科学研究和工业化试验，但技术力量还很薄弱，必须进一步加强这方面的工作，要打破重重技术关，从事更多工业化试验，为大规模发展煤炼油工业和煤的综合利用创造条件，为石油工业开辟更广阔的途径而奋斗！
