China's Sporting Future is Radiant
Speech by Committee Member Zhao Junmai

I fully and wholeheartedly support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. I also fully agree with the solemn condemnation by the committee members of the interference by imperialists and foreign reactionaries in our country's Tibet issue. I also fully support the Central People's Government's various measures to quell the Tibetan rebels, and pay the highest respect to the People's Liberation Army for its swift suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, its defense of the unity of the motherland, and its great contribution to safeguarding the national defense of the motherland.

Last year was a year of great leap forward for all undertakings in our country, and sports were of course no exception. Since liberation, numerous miracles have emerged in sports in our country, too many to list. For example, Comrade Rong Guotuan, the world youth table tennis champion we saw this time, is a new type of athlete completely cultivated by the Party. This was an unimaginable event before liberation.

Now, I will only give a brief report to the conference on what I saw regarding sports during this inspection tour:

(1) On Diligently and Frugally Running Sports

(1) The Fujian Sports College in Fuzhou uses a dilapidated old temple as a school building, and most of the renovation work is done by the students themselves. This not only gives students physical labor training but also educates them on running undertakings diligently and frugally. This kind of creation of sports undertakings from scratch, from small to large, gave me a very profound inspiration. Another example is the corridor runway in Fuzhou, which solves the problem that it is impossible to practice running regularly in rainy areas in our country. It is also a creative and frugal example of running sports.

(2) The 400-meter runway and field built by the masses in the Xiacheng District of Hangzhou using their own labor is worth introducing. Originally, this area was a dirty slum, which was not hygienic and was prone to fire, and was an urgent problem to be solved in urban construction. During the high tide of the sports Great Leap Forward last year, under the leadership of the branch secretary, the masses spontaneously rose up, united as one, used their own labor, used thatched shed waste to make equipment, and properly accommodated hundreds of slum dwellers in the homes of residents in the district. Therefore, the dirty area was transformed into a clean sports venue, which not only solved the problem of no sports field in the district, but also solved the matters to be handled in urban construction, and the slum dwellers also got better housing. This is a good example of the masses running sports quickly, well, and economically.

(2) Regarding Nutrition

In this regard, there is Fuzhou No. 10 Middle School. According to comrades from the Fujian Sports Commission, the students of this school have good physical fitness, few diseases, and the best sports performance. I paid close attention to visiting the school, and I found that the school's meals were particularly well-run. Not only were the kitchen, chefs, utensils, and food very clean and hygienic, but also the food was fresh, diverse, and rich. The reason for this is: first, the teachers and students of the school often engage in productive labor, producing a considerable amount of non-staple food for meals; second, the school joined the suburban people's commune and received timely and sufficient supply of fresh food from the commune, so the food is fresh, diverse, and rich, which is of great benefit to the students' nutrition and health. The situation of Fuzhou No. 10 Middle School shows that the combination of education and productive labor and the people's commune have also played a considerable role in improving the school's meals and enhancing students' nutrition and health.

(3) Regarding the Combination of Indigenous and Foreign Methods

(1) According to comrades from the Shanghai Sports Commission, Shanghai is conducting some research and experiments on the combination of indigenous and foreign methods in gymnastics, and is gradually promoting mass collective gymnastics with national forms, and has achieved some gains in a short period of time.

(2) There are two examples in Fujian that are worth introducing: one is the male high jumper Li Youbin, who was originally a martial arts actor in a Peking Opera troupe. After only two months of high jump training, he won second place in the national high jump competition. The other is the female gymnast Ye Jintang, who was originally an actress in a Min opera troupe. After only fifty days of modern gymnastics training, she won fifth place in the national gymnastics competition. According to comrades from the Fujian Sports Commission, because they already had a martial arts foundation, it was easy for them to reach the height of modern sports technology.

The above examples show that the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is worth studying in sports.

(4) Regarding Sports Serving Productive Labor

In this regard, it is worth particularly introducing the productive gymnastics movement created by Shanghai. The Shanghai Sports Commission has compiled a set of productive gymnastics textbooks. According to the responsible comrade of the Sports Commission, the experimental results are quite effective and are now being gradually promoted. This is the highest and most important glorious task of sports in socialist construction. It is designed for the sports activities needed by workers in productive labor, and it has a considerable relationship to the health of workers and increased production and savings. This is the implementation of the correct policy of sports serving the working class, and is the most important sports work that should be well studied and greatly promoted.

(5) China's Sporting Future is Radiant

Mass sports in our country only really started to develop comprehensively during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, so it is only the beginning of a Great Leap Forward. From the competitive aspect, due to the Party's emphasis on sports since liberation, a large number of teachers have been trained, many basic constructions and equipment have been added, and many advanced experiences have been accumulated. With the support and encouragement of the Party, a vast mass sports reserve force has been formed throughout the country. What is particularly noteworthy is that youth amateur sports schools have sprung up all over the country like mushrooms after rain. For example, the number of youth amateur sports schools in Shanghai alone leaped from ten in 1957 to 1,573 in 1958. The same leap forward increase is also seen across the country. This future strong and excellent reserve sports army is developing and growing comprehensively like a hundred flowers blooming. This is an unprecedented beauty in the history of sports in our country. This is the brilliant achievement shown by the correct policy of the Party's combination of popularization and improvement of sports, which is mastered by the masses. A vision of a radiant sporting future is unfolding before us, not only can we climb the peak of the world in competition, but we will certainly be able to complete the glorious task of "strengthening the people's physique" as instructed by Chairman Mao.

Finally, I deeply regret that I have not seen enough and deeply this time, and my knowledge of sports is too low to make more and better introductions. Please criticize the committee members.

### 我国体育运动前途光芒万丈  赵君迈委员的发言

专栏：

　　我国体育运动前途光芒万丈
    赵君迈委员的发言
    我完全衷心拥护周恩来总理和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、李维汉副主席的报告。我又完全同意各位委员对帝国主义和外国反动派对我们祖国西藏问题的干涉的严正谴责。我又完全拥护中央人民政府对西藏叛乱分子的各项平定措施，并对于人民解放军迅速的平息西藏叛乱，捍卫了祖国统一，保卫了祖国国防的伟大功勋致以最崇高的敬礼。
    去年是我国各项事业大跃进年，体育运动当然没有例外。解放以来我国在体育运动方面涌出不少奇迹是举不胜举，如我们这次所看到的青年世界乒乓冠军容国团同志就是完全在党培养出来的新型运动员，这是在解放以前所想像不到的事件。
    现在我仅就我这一次在视察中所看到的关于体育运动方面向大会作一简单汇报如下：
    （一）关于勤俭办体育方面
    （1）福州有一所福建体育专科学校是利用一个破旧老庙作为校舍，大部分修整工作都是学生亲自动手做的。这不独使学生受到体力劳动的锻炼而且受到勤俭办事业的教育。这种从无到有从小到大创办体育事业给了我很深刻的启示。又如福州的走廊跑道，解决了我国多雨地区不能经常练跑的问题，也是一个创造性的勤俭办体育的好例子。
    （2）在杭州下城区群众自动用自己的劳力所建成的四百公尺跑道的田径运动场是值得介绍的。原来这个地区是一个肮脏棚户区，既不合卫生又怕火灾，为市政建设中亟待解决的问题。在去年体育大跃进高潮中，在支部书记领导下，群众自动起来，万众一心用自己的劳动，利用茅棚废料做设备，并把几百棚户妥善的安插住在本区居民家中。因此就把肮脏之区变成整洁的运动场所，既解决了区内无运动场问题，又解决了市政建设上所要办的事情，棚户也得到较好的住所。这是又快又好又省群众办体育的一个很好的例子。
    （二）关于营养方面
    在这方面有福州第十中学，据福建体委同志说，该校学生体质好疾病少，体育运动也是最好之一个。我很注意参观了该校，我发现该校的伙食办得特别好。它不独厨房、厨师、用具、食物非常清洁卫生，而且食品新鲜多样丰富。考其原因：一是由于该校师生经常进行生产劳动，生产了相当多的副食品以供伙食之用；一是该校加入了郊区人民公社在新鲜食物方面得到公社及时充分的供应，因而食物新鲜多样而又丰富，对学生营养健康大有好处。从福州第十中学情况说明教育与生产劳动相结合和人民公社对学校改良伙食和增强学生营养健康也起了相当大的作用。
    （三）关于土洋结合方面
    （1）据上海体委同志说，上海市正在体操方面进行一些土洋相结合的研究和试验工作，并在逐渐推行群众性的带民族形式的集体体操运动，在短期内已得到一些收获。
    （2）在福建有两个例子值得介绍的：一个是跳高男运动员李幼斌原为京剧团武生演员，仅仅经两个月的跳高训练竟得到全国跳高第二名。另外一个是体操女运动员叶金棠原是一个闽剧团演员，仅仅只得到五十天的现代体操训练，在全国体操比赛竟得到第五名 据福建体委同志说由于他们原来已有武艺基础所以容易达到现代运动技术的高度。
    由以上例子说明土洋相结合在体育运动方面是值得研究的。
    （四）关于体育为生产劳动服务方面
    在这方面值得特别介绍的是上海市所创办的生产体操运动，上海市体委已编出一套生产体操运动课本。据体委负责同志说，试验结果颇有功效，现在正在逐步推广中，这是体育运动在社会主义建设中最高最主要的光荣任务。它是针对着工人在生产劳动中所需要的体育活动而设计的，它对工人健康和增产节约都有相当大的关系。这是贯彻了体育为工人阶级服务的正确方针，是应当好好研究大大推广的一项最重要的体育工作。
    （五）我国的体育运动前途光芒万丈
    我国群众性的体育运动在一九五八年大跃进中才真正全面地开展起来，所以它仅仅是一个大跃进的开端。从竞赛方面说由于解放以来党对体育运动的重视，培养了大批师资，增加了许多基本建设和设备以及积累了许多先进经验。在党的支持和鼓舞下全国已经形成了广大群众性的体育运动后备队伍。其中特别值得注意的是青少年业余体育学校如雨后春笋一样在全国普遍地涌现出来了。如上海市一地的少年业余体育学校从一九五七年十所到一九五八年就跃进到一千五百七十三所之多。全国各地也是同样的跃进式的增加。这一支未来强大优秀后备体育大军正像百花盛开一样正在全面地发育成长中，这是在我国体育史上从来所未有的美景。这是党的体育运动普及和提高相结合的正确方针为群众所掌握所显示出来的辉煌成绩。一幅体育运动的光芒万丈的远景正在我们前面展开着，不仅在竞赛方面可以攀登世界的高峰，并且一定可以完成毛主席所指示的“增强人民体质”的光荣任务。
    最后，由于我这次看得不够多不够深，我的体育运动知识水平又太低，不能作出较多较好的介绍深为遗憾，请各位委员批评。
