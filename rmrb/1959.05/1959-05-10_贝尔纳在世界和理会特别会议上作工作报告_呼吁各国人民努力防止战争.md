Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 8th - The World Peace Council Special Meeting opened here this afternoon. Council Vice-Chairman John Bernal delivered a report at the opening session on the work and future of the world peace movement.

Bernal first spoke about the work of the world peace movement over the past ten years. He pointed out, "After these ten years, we should have reached a certain degree of maturity in our thinking and have confidence in our working methods. One thing we understood in the past and still understand now is that we must work hard to awaken as many people as possible in all countries to use various methods to promote and strive to ensure peace and to stop activities that attempt to create another world war."

Bernal then said that over the years, a great unified movement has been established, which has been and continues to expand around the globe. At the same time, within each country, this movement has spread to all levels of the people.

Bernal said that past achievements should not make us complacent and stagnant. We must be especially vigilant and especially active, especially at this juncture when serious negotiations are about to begin.

Bernal emphasized that the people must work against the forces that favor war, the advocates of arms expansion and military treaties, and the supporters and defenders of colonial rule.

Speaking about the current situation, he pointed out that our main goal remains to end the Cold War. This is an action that can be carried out step by step. Here and now, we must solve the most difficult and dangerous problem—the German problem. We must study and encourage all the suggestions before us regarding holding relays, marches, demonstrations, and sending representatives to Geneva to meet with foreign ministers, to ensure the success of this meeting of foreign ministers from the East and West and the subsequent summit meeting.

Bernal said that the second issue is the destruction of nuclear weapons. We will continue to work to make the Geneva conference discussing the cessation of nuclear testing a success. We must strive to establish nuclear-free zones in all regions of the world as the first step towards universal nuclear disarmament. We must safeguard the right of countries to independence and the right of countries artificially separated to achieve unification, such as in Korea and Vietnam.

He also said that we hope to see the newly established countries in Africa prosper and expand their influence. The right to national independence must be expanded from the political to the economic aspect.

Speaking about the path to industrialization and improvement of agriculture in underdeveloped areas, Bernal said that China's example shows what people can do and have done—both grain and steel production have more than doubled, and there has been corresponding growth in other areas. All these achievements have been achieved by the Chinese people through their own efforts and with the help of the Soviet Union. Bernal concluded by saying that we need to issue another appeal to the world so that people's demands on the following three main goals are unified: strive for the success of the summit negotiations, start solving the German problem, and stipulate certain measures related to implementing isolation in Europe; agree to stop nuclear testing as the first step towards banning all nuclear weapons; and, most importantly, end the Cold War.

　　贝尔纳在世界和理会特别会议上作工作报告
    呼吁各国人民努力防止战争
    新华社斯德哥尔摩8日电　世界和平理事会特别会议今天下午在这里开幕。理事会副主席约翰·贝尔纳在开幕会上作了关于世界和平运动的工作和前途的报告。
    贝尔纳首先谈到十年来世界和平运动的工作。他指出，“经过这十年，我们应该已经在我们的思想上达到了一定程度的成熟，并且对我们的工作方法有了信心。我们过去了解并且现在仍然了解的一点是，我们必须努力工作，以便在一切国家唤起尽可能多的人用各种方法来进行宣传和努力，以确保和平和制止企图制造另一次世界大战的活动。”
    贝尔纳接着说，这些年来，已经建立了一个伟大的统一的运动，这个运动已经并且仍然在继续向全球各地扩展中。同时，在每一个国家内，这种运动已经遍及各阶层的人民。
    贝尔纳说，过去的成就不应该使我们自满和停滞不前。我们必需格外警惕和格外积极，在目前即将开始举行认真的谈判的这个关头，尤其应该如此。
    贝尔纳强调说，人民必须努力反对那些赞成战争的力量、扩军和军事条约的鼓吹者以及殖民统治的支持者和维护者。
    他在谈到当前局势时指出，我们的主要目的仍然是结束冷战。这是可以逐步进行的行动。此时此地，我们必须解决最困难和危险的问题——德国问题。我们必须研究和鼓励摆在我们面前的一切有关举行接力、游行、示威和派代表去日内瓦会见各国外长的建议，以保证东西方外长的这一次会议以及应当接着召开的最高级会议成功。
    贝尔纳说，第二个问题是销毁核武器的问题。我们将继续努力，促使讨论停止核试验问题的日内瓦会议获得成功。我们必须争取在世界一切地区建立无原子区，作为普遍裁减原子军备的第一步。我们必须维护各国独立的权利，维护被人为地分开的国家实行统一的权利，例如在朝鲜和越南。
    他又说，我们希望看到非洲新建立的国家繁荣昌盛和扩大它们的影响。民族独立的权利必须从政治方面扩大到经济方面。
    贝尔纳在谈到不发达地区工业化和改进农业的道路时说，中国的例子说明人们能够做到和已经做到哪些事情——粮食和钢的生产都增加一倍多，其它方面也有相应的增长。这一切成就都是中国人民通过自己的努力和在苏联的帮助下取得的。贝尔纳最后说，我们还需要再向全世界发出另一次呼吁，以便使人民在以下三个主要目标上的要求统一起来，这三个目标就是：争取使最高级谈判获得成就、着手解决德国问题和规定某些有关在欧洲实行隔离的措施；同意停止核试验，作为禁止一切核武器的第一步；而最重要的则是结束冷战。
