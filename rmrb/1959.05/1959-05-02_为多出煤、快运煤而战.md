Comrade representatives,

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

The Higher the Transportation Efficiency, the Better the Production Tasks are Completed

In the Great Leap Forward last year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau produced 13.6 million tons of raw coal, an increase of 80 percent over 1957. This year's national plan is 21 million tons, the same as the coal capital Fushun. This year's plan is 55 percent higher than in 1958. Judging from the current enthusiasm of the workers, the national plan will be greatly overfulfilled. In the first quarter of this year, coal production and coal transportation in our city achieved a double leap forward. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in our city in recent years. In the high-yield, high-quality red flag competition, the Fuxin Mining Bureau fired the first shot in the first quarter, and gloriously won the red flag awarded by the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee for the comprehensive leap forward in coal production, tunneling, stripping, and transportation. Fuxin Railway Station gloriously won the red flag of the National Red Flag Station awarded by the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Provincial People's Committee. At the beginning of April this year, a national on-site meeting was held in Fuxin City to exchange experiences in national railway transportation. This good start in the first quarter has created a good beginning for a good quarter, and a good year.

These achievements are the result of launching a mass movement under the leadership of the Party. The high-yield transportation campaign from November last year to March this year proves that seizing time to get wagons, and seeking efficiency through cooperation, are important ways to ensure the continuous leap forward of railway transportation. In the past five months, Fuxin Station has not only completed the transportation tasks of coal for the steel industry and other aspects, but also, by continuously breaking through the leap forward targets of shortening the vehicle dwell time, the average operation time has been shortened from more than 14 hours before the movement to 5.8 hours in March, and the transportation efficiency has been more than doubled. The daily loading capacity has increased from more than 500 wagons to more than 900 wagons, saving the country 16,800 wagons without spending a penny, which can load more than 700,000 tons of coal. Practice has proved that the closer the cooperation, the higher the transportation efficiency, and the better the production tasks are completed. For example, good cooperation in March resulted in a double leap forward in coal production and coal transportation. In March, 1.87 million tons of coal were produced, 211.4 percent of the same period last year. The dwell time of Fuxin Station vehicles was 5.8 hours, saving the country more than 5,000 wagons, which greatly improved the wagon turnaround rate.

Organize Cooperation, Help Each Other, and Ensure the Completion of Key Tasks

The great rectification movement is a profound ideological revolution. In order to solve the problem of road-mine cooperation, we directed the spearhead of rectification at departmentalism. Workers put up big-character posters saying: "The two families are doing the same thing, why not merge them?" At that time, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Coal Industry also pointed out the direction that road and mines could merge institutions. Through consultation, we merged the West Fuxin Station and the rolling stock section of the Transportation Department of the Fuxin Mining Bureau into Fuxin Station, and the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations also changed accordingly. The Sales Section of the Mining Bureau was transferred to the Transportation Department, and the Transportation Department was renamed the Transportation and Sales Department. The merger of road and mine transportation departments is a systemic revolution. Because the form of transportation organization has changed, a series of cooperative relationships have emerged. Problems that have been unresolved for several years have been readily solved. Its outstanding feature is that the new institution connects all links of transportation into an organic whole, realizing an unprecedented twelve unifications in transportation, namely: unified thought, unified leadership, unified institution, unified production, transportation and sales, unified planning, unified dispatching, unified shifts, unified indicators, unified statistics, unified equipment, unified signals, and unified inspection and summary.

Cooperation is one of the basic characteristics of socialist production relations. Road-mine cooperation and the cooperation of loading, unloading, and transportation have greatly liberated productive forces, making the transportation work an unprecedented leap forward. The broad masses of road and mine workers created a method of organizing "Red Flag Trains" in the movement, which is a concentrated expression of great cooperation. The characteristics of the "Red Flag Train" are "unified direction, guaranteeing key points, loading in batches, and sending out centrally," reducing many operations such as disintegration, assembly, and marshalling. The dwell time of vehicles at the station does not exceed four hours. In order to shorten the vehicle dwell time, it is also necessary to reform the rules and regulations that bind productive forces. In the five-month movement, Fuxin Station broke 830 outdated rules and regulations and established 723 new ones. For example, the eleven procedures for loading and transporting coal have been changed to five procedures; in the past, it was "one person, one job," with uneven busyness and idleness, but now it is "one person, many skills," helping each other. After this form of labor organization was promoted, from dispatchers to workers, from the eastern district to the western district, they concentrated their efforts to run "Red Flag Trains." The Red Flag Train has become a driving force. It is a fruitful result of road-mine cooperation and road-mine institutional reform, and in turn, it promotes broader and closer cooperation in all links, connecting all links like a red thread, thereby greatly accelerating transportation capacity.

Liberate Thinking, Break Superstition, Be Modest and Prudent, and Advance Victoriously

How do we lead the double leap forward in coal production and coal transportation? We believe that Party organizations and enterprise leaders must be good at grasping the laws of mass movements and always stand at the forefront of the movement. In the mass movement, I paid attention to mastering two laws. One is the relationship between ideological liberation and production leap forward. We paid attention to breaking superstitions and liberating thinking, so that high-yield records of one day or three or four days became a regular level. With the continuous deepening of the movement, small-scale bumper harvests became large-scale bumper harvests, and coal production leaped forward to coal transportation. Every time a superstition is broken, people's minds are liberated once, and the high-yield target leaps forward once. Conversely, the leap forward in production further promotes people's ideological liberation, so that the movement advances wave after wave, and one climax follows another. It is necessary to combine ideological liberation and seeking truth from facts well. There must be both heat and cold. There must be both soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis. Breaking superstition can adhere to the truth, and scientific analysis can make ideals conform to reality. Another law we have learned in the mass movement is the relationship of mutual promotion, mutual penetration, and mutual restriction reflected in the mass movements carried out by two different enterprises. Initially, there were more than 1.5 million tons of fallen coal, some of which had already caught fire, which forced us to grasp transportation work and played a role in promoting transportation. With the high output of transportation, it in turn promoted the high output of coal and required both output and quality to be improved. In March, coal production reached an unprecedented peak, which once again prompted transportation to vigorously promote loading mechanization to meet the needs of high coal production. Because we have grasped this law, we have improved our foresight. In our work, we sometimes put the main force on transportation work, and sometimes concentrate the main force on coal production, so that the production and transportation advance rhythmically. The goal of high coal production and high transportation production has been achieved.

Although we have made some achievements in production and transportation in the first quarter, we still have many shortcomings that must be corrected. Our determination is to be modest and prudent, advance victoriously, carry out mass movements with technological revolution as the center, create more experience, insert more red flags, outstandingly overfulfill the national plan, and present gifts for the tenth anniversary of the National Day. Strive to participate in the "Heroes' Conference" of national advanced producers and advanced collectives in Beijing in December.

### 为多出煤、快运煤而战

专栏：

    为多出煤、快运煤而战
    丘新野代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理关于政府工作报告、和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    运输效率越高生产任务完成的越好
    阜新矿务局在去年大跃进中，生产原煤一千三百六十万吨，比一九五七年增长了百分之八十。今年国家计划是二千一百万吨，与煤都抚顺的产量一样。今年计划比一九五八年增长百分之五十五。根据现在职工的干劲看来，又将大大超额完成国家计划。今年一季度我市煤炭生产和煤炭运输获得了双跃进。这是我市几年来空前未有的现象。阜新矿务局在高产高质的红旗竞赛中，打响了第一季度的第一炮，光荣的获得了辽宁省委和辽宁省人委奖给的煤炭生产、掘进、剥离和运输全面跃进的红旗。阜新车站光荣的获得了铁道部、煤炭工业部和省人委奖给的全国红旗车站的红旗。今年四月初在阜新市召开了全国现场会议，交流了全国铁路运输的经验。这个一季度开门红的局面，就给季季红、全年红创造了一个良好的开端。
    这些成就是在党的领导下，大搞群众运动的结果。从去年十一月到今年三月的运输高产运动证明，向时间要车，向协作要效率是保证铁路运输不断跃进的重要途径。五个月来，阜新车站不仅完成了钢铁工业和其他方面用煤的运输任务，并且由于不断突破缩短车辆停留时间的跃进指标，平均一次作业时间从运动前十四个多小时，三月份缩短到五点八小时，运输效率提高一倍多；日装车能力由五百多车增加到九百多车，一个钱不花为国家节省出车皮一万六千八百个，可以多装出七十多万吨煤。实践证明协作的越密切，运输效率越高，生产任务完成的越好。例如三月份协作的好，作到了煤炭生产和煤炭运输双跃进。在三月份，生产煤炭一百八十七万吨，为去年同时期的百分之二百一十一点四。阜新车站车辆在站停留时间为五点八小时，给国家节省五千多个车皮，大大的提高了车皮周转率。
    组织协作互相帮助保证重点完成任务
    伟大的整风运动，是一次很深刻的思想革命。为了解决路矿协作问题，我们把整风的矛头指向本位主义，工人大鸣大放大字报集中在：“两家干的是一回事，干脆合了吧”。当时铁道部、煤炭工业部也指出了路矿可以合并机构的方向。我们通过协商，把西阜新车站和阜新矿务局运输部的车务段合并为阜新车站，党团和工会组织也随之改变了。矿务局销售科下放到运输部，改运输部为运销部。路矿运输部门合并机构，是一个体制革命，由于运输组织形式改变了，所以一系列的协作关系就出现了。几年来久悬未决的问题，迎刃而解了。它的突出特点是：通过新的机构把运输各个环节串连起来成为一个有机的整体，实现了运输上空前未有的十二统一，即：思想统一、领导统一、机构统一、产运销统一、计划统一、调度统一、班次统一、指标统一、统计统一、设备统一、信号统一、检查总结统一。
    协作是社会主义生产关系的基本特征之一。路矿协作和装车、卸车、运输的协作，大大地解放了生产力，使运输工作出现空前未有的大跃进。广大路矿职工在运动中创造了组织“红旗列车”的办法，是大协作的集中表现。“红旗列车”的特点是“统一方向、保证重点、成批装车、集中发出”，减少很多解体、集结、编组等作业过程。车辆在站停留时间不超过四小时。为了缩短车辆停留时间又必须改革束缚生产力的规章制度。阜新车站在五个月的运动中破了八百三十条陈旧的规章制度，立了七百二十三条。如把装运煤的十一道工序改为五道工序；过去是“一人一职”，忙闲不均，现在是“一人多艺”，互相帮助。这种劳动组织形式，经过提倡推广以后，从调度到工人，从东区到西区都集中力量为开出“红旗列车”而努力。红旗列车成了促进车。它是路矿协作、路矿机构改革结下的一个硕果，反过来又促进各个环节更广泛、更密切的协作，像一条红线一样把各个环节串连起来了，从而大大的加速了运输力。
    解放思想破除迷信戒骄戒躁乘胜前进
    我们是怎样领导煤炭生产和煤炭运输双跃进的呢？我们认为党的组织和企业领导干部，要善于掌握群众运动的规律，时刻站在运动的最前列。在群众运动中，我注意掌握了两个规律。一个是思想解放与生产跃进的关系。我们注意了破除迷信，解放思想，从而使一天的或三四天的高产纪录变成经常的水平。随着运动的不断深入，由小面积丰产变成大面积丰产，由煤炭生产跃进到煤炭运输跃进。每当破除一次迷信，人们的思想就解放一次，高产指标就跃进一次。反过来生产上的跃进，而进一步促进人们的思想解放，从而使运动一浪接一浪，一个高潮接着一个高潮前进。解放思想与实事求是要很好的结合起来。有热必须有冷，既要冲天干劲，也要有科学分析；破除迷信，才能坚持真理，科学分析才能使理想符合实际。在群众运动中我们摸到的另一个规律是：两个不同的企业开展群众运动中所反映的互相促进、互相渗透、互相制约的关系。最初是落地煤一百五十多万吨，有的已经发火，这就逼着我们抓运输工作，起了对运输的促进作用。运输高产起来了，反过又促使煤炭高产并要求产量质量都要提高。三月份煤炭高产达到了从来未有的高峰，于是再一次促使运输大闹装车机械化，以适应煤炭高产的需要。由于摸到了这个规律，提高了预见性。我们工作中，有时把主要力量放在运输工作上，有时把主要力量集中在煤炭生产上，因此作到了产运之间有节奏的前进。达到了煤炭高产和运输高产双丰收的目的。
    我们虽然一季度在生产和运输上取得了一点成绩，但我们的缺点还很多，必须加以纠正。我们的决心是，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，以技术革命为中心的大搞群众运动，创造更多的经验，插更多的红旗，出色地超额完成国家计划，为国庆十周年献礼。争取十二月参加北京全国先进生产者和先进集体的“群英大会”。
