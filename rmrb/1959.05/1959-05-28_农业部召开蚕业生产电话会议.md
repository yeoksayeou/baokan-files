Striving for a Bumper Harvest of Spring Silkworms
Ministry of Agriculture Holds Telephone Conference on Silkworm Production

Xinhua News Agency, 27th - This year, most new and old silkworm regions across the country have expanded the rearing of spring silkworms. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, as of now, the number of spring mulberry silkworm eggs distributed and the number of spring tussah silkworms released have exceeded those of last year. Currently, the first batch of spring cocoons in Guangdong Province has already achieved a bumper harvest, and warmer provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Sichuan are about to begin cocooning, while silkworms in other regions are also developing normally and healthily. A bumper harvest of spring cocoons is expected.

Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture held a telephone conference on silkworm production, hearing reports from major silkworm regions such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Sichuan, Liaoning, Henan, and Guizhou. Judging from the reports, Party and government leaders in various regions have attached great importance to spring silkworm production this year, and silkworm rearing equipment has been prepared in a timely manner. In major mulberry silkworm rearing areas such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong, the communes rearing silkworms have generally established specialized teams for mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing, implementing measures such as contracting work and output, and rewarding overproduction. All regions have strengthened management of mulberry gardens, including cultivation and fertilization, and implemented advanced methods such as alternating row pruning during mulberry picking. Guangyuan County in Sichuan Province has greatly improved work efficiency in releasing tussah silkworms by using aerial cableways and monorail slides to transport silkworms, solving the labor shortage required for expanded release.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest in spring silkworm production this year, the Ministry of Agriculture, in the telephone conference, requested that all regions further increase mulberry leaf production, conserve mulberry leaves, allocate mulberry leaves, and prevent silkworm diseases, and further strengthen mulberry garden management to prepare for summer and autumn silkworm rearing. Regions that raise tussah silkworms should also strive to raise more summer and autumn silkworms this year, select and protect autumn seeds, continue to carry out the technical innovation movement, and do a good job in pest control and drought prevention in tussah forests, in order to produce more tussah silkworm cocoons.

    力争春蚕丰收
    农业部召开蚕业生产电话会议
    新华社27日讯  今年全国新老蚕区大多数扩大了春蚕的饲养。据农业部统计：截至目前，春桑蚕发种数量和春柞蚕放养数量都超过去年。现在，广东省第一次春茧已获丰收，较暖的浙江、江苏、四川等省即将上簇，其他地区蚕儿也发育正常健壮。春茧可望丰收。
    最近，农业部举行了一次蚕业生产电话会议，听取了浙江、江苏、广东、四川、辽宁、河南、贵州等主要蚕区的汇报。从汇报情况看，今年各地党政领导对春蚕生产都很重视，蚕具准备及时。浙江、江苏、四川、广东等主要饲养桑蚕的地区，养蚕的公社一般都成立了培桑养蚕的专业队，实行包工包产、超产奖励等措施。各地对桑园都加强了中耕、施肥等管理工作，在采桑时实行了隔行伐条等先进办法。四川省广元县在放养柞蚕中大搞空中索道、单轨滑道等运蚕工具提高工效，解决了扩大放养所需的劳力。
    为了争取今年春蚕生产丰收，农业部在电话会议上要求各地要进一步增产桑叶、节约桑叶、调剂桑叶和预防蚕病等工作，进一步加强桑园管理，为饲养夏秋蚕作好准备。放养柞蚕的地区今年也要争取多养夏秋蚕，选留和保护秋种，继续开展技术革新运动，做好柞林的除虫、防旱工作，以便增产更多的柞蚕茧。
