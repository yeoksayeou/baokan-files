Xinhua News Agency, May 28th. The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, Pham Binh, held a press conference in Beijing today, sternly condemning the intensified brutal suppression and persecution of patriotic people in South Vietnam by the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh pointed out that after the Phu Loi massacre, the US-Ngo clique, under the command of US military advisor Williams and US military officer Lester, carried out brutal "sweeps" in various parts of South Vietnam and the former resistance base area of the Vietnam People's Army, "D Zone." This fact shows that the US-Ngo clique is intensifying its preparations for war in South Vietnam.

Pham Binh pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of the US-Ngo clique violate the basic objectives of the Geneva Accords and threaten peace in Vietnam and Indochina. Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh demanded that the International Control and Supervision Commission in Vietnam take active measures to require the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately cease all acts of suppression and persecution, cease all military "sweep" activities, and immediately abolish the Ordinance No. 10 of 1959, which the Ngo Dinh Diem clique recently forced the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" to pass with the aim of intensifying the persecution of the South Vietnamese people. Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh also requested the International Commission in Vietnam to urge the South Vietnamese authorities to fully implement the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh revealed in detail that, with the direct participation and command of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities have successively mobilized strong armed forces to the former resistance bases in Thu Dau Mot, Tay Ninh, Ha Tien, Ca Mau, and Tram Chim, as well as to the provinces in the central South Vietnamese mountainous region, launching several campaigns of persecution and "sweeps" against the patriotic people of South Vietnam. Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh pointed out that in the current peaceful environment in South Vietnam, the purpose of the South Vietnamese authorities in launching such large-scale sweeps is to further persecute the South Vietnamese people and to carry out a policy of collective revenge against former resistance personnel.

At the press conference, Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh also exposed the fascist nature of the so-called Ordinance No. 10 of 1959 promulgated by the South Vietnamese authorities. Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh pointed out that this ordinance stipulates that special military courts can be established in the current peaceful environment in South Vietnam, which is a sign of an extremely brutal legal and political system. This ordinance blatantly destroys the most basic principles of litigation and infringes upon the basic rights of the people. What is particularly serious is that the promulgation of this ordinance is also an attempt to obstruct the South Vietnamese people from unifying their motherland by peaceful means. This ordinance marks a new and further development in the South Vietnamese authorities' adoption of policies of persecution and massacre. The US-Ngo clique continues to violate Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords, thereby increasingly moving towards destroying the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh pointed out that while the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is seeking to ease tensions in Europe and the world, the South Vietnamese authorities, in implementing the conspiracy of US imperialism, have intensified their activities to undermine the Geneva Accords and suppress and persecute the patriotic people of South Vietnam. These activities of the South Vietnamese authorities, like the conspiracy of US imperialism to instigate the Royal Lao Government to undermine the Geneva Accords and plot to eliminate the former Lao Fighting Units, are undoubtedly aimed at creating tension in Indochina, making the unification and peace of Vietnam more threatened, and threatening the peace and security of the people of Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.

In answering questions raised by reporters, Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh said that the US-Ngo clique's tyrannical actions of undermining the Geneva Accords and turning South Vietnam into a US military base have been strongly opposed by the South Vietnamese people. He said that the South Vietnamese people have continuously adopted methods such as market strikes and collective petitions to carry out struggles to safeguard their right to life and oppose persecution. On this year's May Day International Labor Day, a demonstration march with 200,000 participants was held in Saigon.

In answering another question, Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh spoke about the current situation in Laos. He accused the Royal Lao Government of launching armed attacks on the former Lao Fighting Units, thereby re-igniting the civil war.

Chargé d'Affaires Pham Binh mentioned the fact that the British government spokesperson, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, had defended the Royal Lao Government's actions in violating the Geneva Accords on the 25th. He emphasized that it is necessary for the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference and all participating countries to take measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are fully implemented and to stop the bloodshed in Laos.

    越南驻我国临时代办招待记者
    斥美吴集团在南越加紧备战
    新华社28日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办范平今天在北京举行的记者招待会上，严正谴责了美国和吴庭艳集团对南越爱国人民的变本加厉的残暴镇压和迫害。范平代办指出，美吴集团在制造了富利惨案以后，又在美国军事顾问威廉斯和美军军官勒斯特指挥下在南越各地以及前越南人民军抗战根据地“D战区”进行了残酷的“扫荡”，这一事实表明，美吴集团正在南越加紧准备战争。
    范平代办指出，美吴集团的上述行动违反了日内瓦协议的基本目的，正在威胁着越南和印度支那地区的和平。范平代办要求越南国际监察和监督委员会采取积极措施，要求南越当局立即停止各种镇压迫害行动，停止各种军事“扫荡”活动，并且立即废弃吴庭艳集团最近强使南越“国会”通过的目的在于加紧迫害南越人民的五九年第十号法令。范平代办并且要求越南国际委员会促使南越当局全部履行日内瓦协议的条款。
    范平代办详细揭露了南越当局在美国的直接参与和指挥下，接二连三地向土龙木、西宁、河仙、金瓯、三川等前抗战根据地以及中越南部山区各省调动雄厚的武装力量，对南越爱国人民多次展开迫害“扫荡”战役的情况。范平代办指出，在南越目前的和平环境中，南越当局发动这样大规模的扫荡的目的在于实现进一步对南越人民进行迫害，并且对前抗战人员进行集体报复的政策。
    范平代办在记者招待会上还揭露了南越当局所颁布的所谓五九年第十号法令的法西斯性质。范平代办指出，这项法令规定在目前南越的和平环境中可以设立特别军事法庭，这是一种无比残暴的法理和政治制度的标志。这项法令明目张胆地摧残了最起码的诉讼原则，并且侵犯了人民的基本权利。而特别严重的是，这一法令的颁布还是企图阻挠南越人民以和平方式来统一祖国的阴谋。这项法令标志着南越当局在采用迫害残杀政策方面有新的进一步的发展。美吴集团继续违反日内瓦协议第十四条丙款，从而愈益走上破坏越南和平统一的道路。
    范平代办指出，当日内瓦外长会议正在谋求缓和欧洲和世界紧张局势的时候，南越当局执行美帝国主义的阴谋，加紧了破坏日内瓦协议和镇压、迫害南越爱国人民的活动。南越当局的这些活动犹如美帝国主义唆使老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议，策划消灭前寮国战斗部队的阴谋一样，无疑地都是为了在印度支那制造紧张局势，使越南的统一和和平受到更大的威胁，并且威胁印度支那和东南亚各国人民的和平和安全。
    范平代办在回答记者提出的问题时说，美吴集团破坏日内瓦协议、把南越变成美国军事基地的横暴行动，已经遭到南越人民的强烈反对。他说，南越人民不断采取罢市，集体请愿等方式，进行维护生活权利和反对迫害的斗争。在今年“五一”国际劳动节，西贡就举行了有二十万人参加的示威游行。
    范平代办在回答另一个问题时，谈到老挝目前的局势。他指责老挝王国政府对前寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻，从而重新挑起内战的行动。
    范平代办提到了作为日内瓦会议主席国之一的英国的政府发言人，在25日曾为老挝王国政府的违反日内瓦协议的行动进行辩解的事实。他强调指出，1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席以及会议的所有参加国有必要采取措施，保证日内瓦协议得到完全履行，制止在老挝发生的流血事件。
