Statement by Committee Member Song Liu Agan Muni:

Mr. Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

I firmly oppose the traitorous actions of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in collusion with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. I support the central government's order to quell the rebellion and dissolve the former Tibetan local government, as well as all related measures. The Tibetan traitorous clique, under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, recently disseminated a so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama," launching numerous slanders against our country. They also raised the banner of religion, attempting to disguise their treasonous and glory-seeking faces as those of pious individuals "defending religious freedom." They claimed that "interference with the right to religious freedom has increased," "a large number of lamas have been arrested," and "temples have been destroyed," etc. These are complete fabrications and lies. Facts prove that religious freedom is a well-established policy of the People's Government, not only solemnly stipulated in the Constitution but also consistently implemented. Many of us Dai people in Xishuangbanna believe in Buddhism. Since liberation, the policy of religious freedom has been thoroughly implemented, religion has been respected, and religious figures have also enjoyed equal rights in terms of political status. For example, I was promoted from Huba to Song Liu Agan Muni. I was also elected as Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China and invited to be a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, participating in national affairs. As for the religious life of the masses, it is also protected. The Buddhist temples throughout the Dai villages still preach scriptures and worship Buddha. The government has also subsidized funds and repaired some temples. In particular, in 1956, the Buddha's tooth was brought to Xishuangbanna, Dehong, and other places for Buddhist devotees to pay homage, fulfilling the wishes that believers had been unable to achieve for thousands of years. The respect and protection of religious freedom in the Tibet region are also well-known. The lies of the Tibetan reactionary clique and foreign reactionaries about religious interference are completely malicious. They attempt to use this to cover up their crimes of betraying the nation, undermining the unity of the motherland, and splitting China. They are like the "Paman" in the Buddhist scriptures, committing all kinds of evil and are enemies of Buddhists. They use religion for counter-revolutionary activities, using temples as command centers for rebellions, killing, arson, robbery, destroying temples, and defiling Buddha statues, completely destroying the dignity of religion. They are the real destroyers of religion.

In order to uphold the national law and the lives and property of the Tibetan people, and also to safeguard the dignity of the Buddha, I firmly support giving these few evildoers the punishment they deserve. Those imperialist elements, especially the expansionist elements in India, also pretend to be "protectors of religion," instructing and colluding with the Tibetan traitorous clique to sing the same tune, in order to engage in the activities of splitting China's unity. We want to warn these hypocritical careerists that the era of the Chinese people being slaughtered at will has gone forever, and the era of Chinese religion being manipulated and exploited at will has passed and can never come again. Please don't have such delusions anymore!

We Dai Buddhists, like the people of the whole country, love the motherland. We must protect the unity and solidarity of the motherland as we protect the "Three Jewels." In the unified family of the motherland, we have embarked on the bright road to prosperous and happy socialism. With the heart of compassion and kindness, and the desire to save all living beings, I wish the Tibetan people, on the basis of quelling the rebellion, will reach the socialist shore as soon as possible through social reform, and build the Tibetan plateau into a true paradise on earth.

### 用事实驳斥“干涉宗教自由”的谰言

    用事实驳斥“干涉宗教自由”的谰言
    松溜·阿戛牟尼委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    我坚决反对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派所进行的叛国行为。拥护中央平息叛乱，解散原西藏地方政府的命令和一切措施。西藏叛国集团，在帝国主义和外国反动派的指使下，最近散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，对我国进行了许多诬蔑，还抬出宗教的招牌，把他们卖国求荣的面目装成“维护宗教自由”的虔诚样子。说什么“对宗教自由权的干涉增加了”，“大批喇嘛被抓了”，“寺庙被毁了”等等，这完全是捏造的谎言。事实证明，宗教信仰自由是人民政府既定的政策，不仅在宪法上作了庄严的规定，而且是一贯坚持执行了的。我们西双版纳的傣族，许多人信奉佛教。解放以来，贯彻执行了宗教信仰自由政策，宗教受到了尊重，宗教界人士在政治地位上，也享受了平等的权利，以我来说，由原来的祜巴升为松溜·阿戛牟尼，还被选为中国佛教协会副会长，被邀请为全国政协委员，参预国家大事。至于群众宗教生活，也是受到保护的，遍布在傣族农村中的佛寺，照样讲经拜佛，政府还补助经费、修理了一些佛寺。特别是在一九五六年，更把佛牙奉迎到西双版纳、德宏等地，供佛教徒朝拜供奉，满足了信徒们千百年来不能达到的愿望。至于西藏地区宗教信仰自由得到尊重和保护，也是人所共知的。西藏反动集团和外国反动派所说的宗教受到干涉的谎话，是完全别有用心的。他们企图借此来掩饰他们出卖民族，破坏祖国统一分裂中国的罪恶。他们像佛经上说的“叭满”一样，到处为非作歹，是佛教徒的敌人。他们利用宗教作反革命活动，以寺庙作为叛乱的指挥部，杀人放火，抢劫财物，破坏寺庙、沾污佛象，彻底破坏了宗教的尊严，他们才是真正的宗教破坏者。
    为了维护国法和西藏人民生命财产，也为了维护佛的尊严，我坚决拥护给这些少数的恶人以应得的惩罚。那些帝国主义分子，特别是印度的扩张主义分子，也装出“宗教保护者”的样子，指使和勾结西藏叛国集团分子同唱一个调子，来干分裂中国统一的勾当，我们要警告这些伪善的野心家，中国人任人宰割的时代，已经一去不复返了，中国的宗教任人操纵利用的时代，也已经过去再也不能来了。请他们不要再做这样的迷梦吧！
    我们傣族的佛教徒，也和全国人民一样，热爱祖国，我们要像保护“三宝”一样的保护祖国的统一团结。在祖国的统一大家庭中，我们已经走上了繁荣、幸福的社会主义光明大道。我本着慈悲为善，普渡众生的心肠，祝愿藏族人民在平定叛乱的基础上，通过社会改革，早日登上社会主义的彼岸，把西藏高原建设成为一个真正的人间乐园。
