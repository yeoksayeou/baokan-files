Xinhua News Agency, 4th—The Panchen Erdeni, at the invitation of the Buddhist Association of China, went to Guangji Temple, which has a history of over eight hundred years, this morning to hold a sutra transmission ceremony.

In Guangji Temple, bells and drums rang in unison, and incense smoke curled upwards. When the Panchen Lama arrived in front of the Hall of Heavenly Kings by car, Xi Rao Jiacuo, president of the Buddhist Association of China, and vice presidents Zhao Puchu, Zhou Shujia, Ju Zan, Neng Hai, and A Wang Jia Cuo, among others, greeted him solemnly with incense. Xi Rao Jiacuo presented a hada to the Panchen Lama on behalf of the greeters. More than 300 lamas, monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists welcomed him with palms together.

Following this, the Panchen Lama went to the Relic Pavilion to pay homage to the Buddha's Tooth, sprinkling it with nectar and highland barley, symbolizing auspiciousness.

Inside the resplendent Hall of Great Strength, Buddhist lamps shone brightly, and it was filled with Buddhist banners. After the Panchen Lama paid homage to the statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, he ascended the Buddha's seat for the transmission of sutras. At this time, Xi Rao Jiacuo and others performed a grand homage to the Panchen Lama, presenting him with a "Mandala" and hada.

Today, in the Hall of Great Strength, the Panchen Lama lectured on three Tibetan scriptures: "The Three Essentials of the Path," "Foundation of Merit," and "Prayer for the Flourishing of Buddhism." At the end of the sutra transmission, the Panchen Lama said to the listeners: "Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we pray for the unification and prosperity of our motherland. In our unified and prosperous motherland family, we fully enjoy the freedom of religious belief."

At this moment, the listeners in the hall recited the Mangala Sutta. The Buddhist Association of China presented the Panchen Lama with a statue of Sakyamuni, a pagoda, and a Tripitaka. The listeners lined up to receive the Panchen Lama's head-touching blessing and the "Vajra Knot" (a type of red silk ribbon) bestowed upon them in front of the Buddha's seat.

Dr. Malalasekera, Honorary President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists, who is currently visiting our country, attended the sutra transmission in the Hall of Great Strength today.

After the sutra transmission ceremony, the Panchen Lama visited the Buddha statues and other gifts presented to the Buddhist Association of China by the Soviet Union, Burma, Nepal, Ceylon, Vietnam, and other countries in the Hall of Treasures.

In the afternoon, the Buddhist Association of China held a banquet to entertain the Panchen Lama. Invited to the banquet were Zhang Jingwu, Central Representative stationed in Tibet; Sa Kongliao, Yang Jingren, and Xie Hechou, Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission; He Chengxiang, Director of the State Council Religious Affairs Bureau; and Apei Awang Jinmei, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Chang Dong Jijinmei, Standing Committee Member, among others.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th—Before the Panchen Erdeni transmitted sutras at Guangji Temple in Beijing today, he received Dr. Malalasekera, Honorary President of the World Fellowship of Buddhists, who is currently visiting our country.

Malalasekera said that he had visited many places in China and had seen that the Chinese government had given a lot of help to Buddhism. He had seen the flourishing state of Buddhism in China. He said, "I firmly believe that Tibetan Buddhism under the leadership of the Panchen Buddha can help society progress."

The Panchen Lama told Malalasekera that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army had quelled the rebellion launched by the reactionary elements of the upper strata in Tibet. He said that the Central People's Government had always implemented a policy of freedom of religious belief, temples had been protected, and many dilapidated temples had been repaired. The upper-level Tibetan rebellious elements launched a rebellion under the guise of "protecting religion," but in fact, it was these people who, for their selfish purposes, destroyed religion and even used temples as bases for rebellion.

Present at the meeting were Xi Rao Jiacuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China, and Zhao Puchu, Vice President, among others.

    新华社4日讯　班禅额尔德尼大师应中国佛教协会邀请，今天上午到有八百多年历史的广济寺举行了传经仪式。
    广济寺里钟鼓齐鸣，香烟缭绕，当班禅大师乘车到达天王殿前的时候，中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错，副会长赵朴初、周叔迦、巨赞、能海、阿旺嘉错等人持香隆重迎接，喜饶嘉错代表迎接人向班禅大师献哈达。三百多喇嘛、僧尼、居士列队合掌欢迎。
    接着，班禅大师到舍利阁朝拜了佛牙，向佛牙洒了象征吉祥的甘露和青稞。
    金碧辉煌的大雄殿里佛灯明亮，挂满佛幡，班禅大师朝拜了释迦牟尼佛像以后，走上传经的佛座，这时喜饶嘉错等人向班禅大师进行隆重朝拜，向他献了“曼礼”和哈达。
    今天班禅大师在大雄殿讲了“道之三要”、“功德基础”、“佛教昌隆愿文”三部藏经。传经结束时，班禅大师向听经的人们说：“在我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，我们为祖国的统一和富强进行祈祷。在我们统一和富强的祖国大家庭里，我们充分地享受到宗教信仰的自由。”
    这时，大殿里听经的人们念起了吉祥经，中国佛教协会向班禅大师献了释迦牟尼像、宝塔和一部大藏经。听经的人们排队到佛座前接受了班禅大师的摸顶和赐给的“金刚结”（一种红色绸带）。
    正在我国进行访问的世界佛教徒联谊会名誉会长马拉拉塞克拉博士，今天到大雄殿列席听经。
    传经仪式结束以后，班禅大师在多宝殿里参观了苏联、缅甸、尼泊尔、锡兰、越南等国送给中国佛教协会的佛像等礼品。
    下午，中国佛教协会举行宴会招待班禅大师。应邀参加宴会的，有中央驻西藏代表张经武，民族事务委员会副主任萨空了、杨静仁、谢鹤筹，国务院宗教事务局局长何成湘和西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美、常务委员詹东·计晋美等。
    新华社4日讯　班禅额尔德尼大师今天在北京广济寺传经以前，接见了正在我国访问的世界佛教徒联谊会名誉会长马拉拉塞克拉博士。
    马拉拉塞克拉说，他在中国访问了很多地方，他看到中国政府对佛教给予了很多帮助。看到了中国佛教昌盛的情况。他说，我深信，在班禅佛领导下的西藏佛教，是能帮助社会进步的。
    班禅大师告诉马拉拉塞克拉，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，人民解放军已经平定了西藏上层反动分子发动的叛乱。他说，中央人民政府一贯是执行宗教信仰自由政策的，寺庙得到了保护，许多破旧的寺庙得到了修复。西藏上层叛乱分子假借着“保护宗教”的幌子发动叛乱，其实正是这些人为了自私自利的目的，破坏了宗教，他们竟然把寺庙当作叛乱的阵地。
    接见时在座的有中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错和副会长赵朴初等人。
