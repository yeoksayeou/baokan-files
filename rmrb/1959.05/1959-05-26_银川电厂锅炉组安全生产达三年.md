Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 25th: The boiler team of the Yinchuan Power Plant in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has achieved excellent results in safe production. From April 20, 1956, to May 20 this year, for three years and one month, they have not had a single production accident. The boiler is still operating normally, and the workers have proposed to create a record of 2,000 days of safe operation.

The boiler at the Yinchuan Power Plant is an old boiler that has been in use for ten years, and more than one-third of the workers operating this boiler are new apprentices. Based on these circumstances, the factory leadership paid special attention to the safety education and technical education of the workers in this group. All the workers in the group have consistently adhered to the implementation of the responsibility card system and the patrol inspection system, strengthened the maintenance and repair of the boiler, and conducted acceptance inspections by the team leader and group leader after each repair. For new apprentices, they insisted on technical lessons, and also organized experienced workers to sign apprenticeship contracts with new workers, so that more than 95% of the new workers quickly mastered the operating techniques and avoided accidents.
