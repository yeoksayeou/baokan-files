Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, May 25th: Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya returned to Vientiane on the 24th after completing his activities in South Vietnam.

According to reports, before departing, Panya told Agence France-Presse reporters that he openly opposed the continuation of the International Control Commission's work in Laos, disregarding the Geneva Accords. He said there was no reason to resume the International Commission's activities because "it has nothing to do."

The news stated that during his activities in Saigon, Khamphan Panya held six days of negotiations with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. After the negotiations, Laos and South Vietnam concluded agreements on economic, judicial, and other issues.

This agreement was signed when the Royal Lao Government, at the instigation of the United States, took actions to launch a civil war, and the South Vietnamese authorities, with the participation of the United States, intensified their persecution of patriotic people. The detailed content of the agreement has not been disclosed, but it is revealed that the agreement involves cooperation between the two sides in so-called "militia" and "military security forces." A joint communiqué issued by the two delegations stated that this agreement will further strengthen the position of Laos and South Vietnam in "dealing with the communist danger."

    老挝外交大臣曾到南越活动
    勾结吴庭艳进行共同反共勾当
    新华社25日讯  西贡消息：老挝外交大臣坎番·班雅结束了在南越的活动以后，24日从西贡回万象。
    据报道，班雅在动身回国以前对法新社记者谈话时，不顾日内瓦协议，公然表示反对让老挝国际委员会继续工作。他说，没有理由恢复国际委员会的活动，因为“它无事可作”。
    消息说，坎番·班雅在西贡活动期间，同吴庭艳集团进行了六天的谈判。在谈判结束后，老挝和南越缔结了有关经济、司法和其他问题的协定。
    这项协定是在老挝王国政府在美国唆使下采取发动内战的行动以及南越当局在美国参加下加紧迫害爱国人民的时候签订的。协定的详细内容没有公布，据透露，协定中涉及双方在所谓“民兵”和“军事治安部队”方面进行合作的问题。双方代表团发表的联合公报说，这项协定将进一步加强老挝和南越“对付共产党危险”的地位。
