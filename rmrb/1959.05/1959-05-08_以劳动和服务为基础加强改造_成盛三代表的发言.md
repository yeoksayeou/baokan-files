Chairman, fellow delegates:

　　I listened with great excitement to Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 state final accounts and the 1959 state budget draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I express my heartfelt support and will conscientiously implement them in my work.

　　1958 was a year of great leap forward in China's socialist construction and a year of great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction. In this year, the great leap forward on all fronts was unprecedented in its momentum and power. Steel production doubled, grain production doubled; people's communes spread throughout the country; the impact reverberated throughout the world. Truly, songs resounded across the fields, red flags covered the mountains, and a magnificent and splendid new atmosphere permeated everywhere.

　　Under the unified leadership of the Party, various construction undertakings in our Jilin Province, like other parts of the country, are developing vigorously. In 1958, the province's total industrial output value exceeded the state plan, an increase of 49 percent over the previous year. The absolute value of the increase in 1958 was equivalent to the total increase during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. In agriculture, although the province suffered from a drought unseen in thirty years in 1958, the total grain output still reached 7 million tons, exceeding the state plan and increasing by 40 percent compared to 1957. In 1958, our province achieved unprecedented and great victories in developing industrial and agricultural production and completing the people's commune system.

　　In the past year, under the leadership of the Party, the industrialists and businessmen of Jilin Province underwent profound education through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and their political ideology improved to varying degrees. Driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, many people joined the ranks of the great leap forward. In the nationwide steelmaking campaign, many people worked with the staff and workers to actively find ways to overcome technical difficulties in order to complete the steel production tasks; they worked tirelessly in front of the high-temperature furnaces, day and night, even staying up for several nights. In terms of supporting agricultural production, many people participated in drought resistance, deep plowing of land, and construction of water conservancy projects, and received praise and encouragement from the communes and farmers. Many people have also made certain contributions in terms of dedicating skills and ideas, improving business management, improving service attitudes, and offering rationalization proposals. In the socialist competition, some people have also been rated as advanced producers. Judging from these actions, it can be explained that the political and ideological outlook of the majority of our industrialists and businessmen has undergone significant changes; and that they have made considerable progress on the road of self-reform. However, this certainly does not mean that the majority of our industrialists and businessmen have fundamentally changed their capitalist stand to a socialist stand, or have gotten rid of their two-sidedness. Many facts prove that many of our industrialists and businessmen have not wholeheartedly accepted the leadership of the Party, and many have varying degrees of aversion to self-reform; some people have made some progress in reform, but they mistakenly believe that they have reformed almost completely and no longer need to carry out fundamental reform of their political stand, only ideological reform. From the above-mentioned problems, it can be seen that, whether in work or labor, compared with the working people, there is still a big gap, which is not adapted to the current rapidly developing situation.

　　In March of this year, after conveying and implementing the spirit and resolutions of the joint executive committee (enlarged) meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association, and listening to the instructions of the responsible comrades of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee, the industrialists and businessmen of our province further improved their ideological understanding through study and discussion. They further realized that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the fundamental reform of political stand and ideology. As Premier Zhou pointed out in the government work report, our industrialists and businessmen must continue to carry out self-education and self-reform in the work of participating in socialist construction. As bourgeois elements who have not yet achieved fundamental reform and have not yet been transformed into laborers, it is even more necessary to continue to carry out fundamental reform under the situation of the rapid development of socialist construction in the motherland. Therefore, it is the right path to actively overcome incorrect thoughts and understanding, establish a sense of honor in reform, and continuously enhance the consciousness of reform, in actively serving the cause of socialist construction. If our industrialists and businessmen want to achieve the goal of fundamental reform, they must closely combine reform with service under the leadership of the Party, strengthen reform through service, and actively serve in reform. Reform and service are inseparable as a whole, and the relationship between the two is mutually reinforcing. The better the reform, the better the service will be. If one leaves service practice and engages in empty talk about reform, it is unimaginable. Therefore, in the process of self-reform, we must, based on the principle of taking political and ideological reform as the commander, taking labor and practice as the foundation, and taking enterprises or work posts as the base, and combining these three, strengthen self-reform and actively serve socialist construction.

　　At present, the socialist construction of the motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the working people's enthusiasm is soaring, which is a great encouragement and impetus for the reform of our industrialists and businessmen, and also provides favorable conditions for our active service. As a patriotic industrialist and businessman, living in such a great era, I deeply feel the infinite glory and the great responsibility. We must take out all our strength, forge ahead bravely, and contribute our expertise or insights to serving socialism, so as not to fail the Party's warmth and concern for our industrialists and businessmen in the reform. In order to realize the major requirements of reform and service, it is necessary to sincerely and honestly accept the leadership of the Party; earnestly learn from the working class; constantly check and revise the self-reform plan; consciously and voluntarily participate in physical labor; and unreservedly contribute one's own technology and talents. In order to enrich the political mind, it is necessary to strengthen the study of political theory and current affairs policies, especially the study of Chairman Mao's works, and actively participate in various political activities. In implementing the above conditions, we must learn to use criticism and self-criticism, help each other, and promote each other. Only by gradually breaking the bourgeois stand and ideology, and establishing the socialist stand and ideology, can we transform from an exploiter into a self-reliant laborer who largely meets the six political standards instructed by Chairman Mao.

　　Recently, a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet, colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion, dreaming of undermining the unity of the motherland and national unity, and permanently placing the Tibetan people under the dark and cruel serf system, which is intolerable to the people of the whole country. We, the industrialists and businessmen of Jilin Province, express our great indignation at this. We resolutely support the various measures proposed by Premier Zhou in his report to quell the Tibetan rebellion. Tibet is Chinese territory, and no one is allowed to conspire to split it. Quelling the Tibetan rebellion is our internal affair, and no foreigner is allowed to interfere. Now, the conspiracies of British imperialism and Indian interventionist elements have been unanimously opposed by the broad masses of people of all nationalities in our country. However, Indian interventionist elements and certain political activists, disregarding the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, rudely interfere in our internal affairs and slander and provoke our country. The Indian police authorities even condoned expansionist elements to conduct "demonstrations," openly insulting Chairman Mao's image in front of our consulate in Mumbai. This is a provocative act against the 650 million people of our country, for which we express great anger. We warn these interferers and reactionaries: keep your heads cool, our country that has stood up, the Chinese people who are building socialism with full confidence, are not weak and can be bullied, and no conspiracy can stop our progress. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the people of all nationalities in the country, the Tibetan people will surely get rid of the backward, dark, and cruel serf system and build a democratic and happy new Tibet.

　　1959 is the tenth anniversary of the founding of our motherland and a year for us to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. We are in such a world-shaking and extraordinary era, and the magnificent future fills each of us with confidence and hope. Under the leadership and education of the Party, we, the industrialists and businessmen, must go all out, strive for the upstream, strengthen reform, actively serve, and, together with the people of the whole country, better contribute all our strength to the great socialist construction of the motherland.

### 以劳动和服务为基础加强改造  成盛三代表的发言

　　以劳动和服务为基础加强改造
    成盛三代表的发言主席，各位代表：
    我以万分兴奋的心情，听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，表示衷心的拥护，并要认真贯彻到工作当中去。
    一九五八年是我国社会主义建设大跃进的一年，是党的社会主义建设总路线伟大胜利的一年。在这一年中，各个战线上的大跃进，声势之大，威力之猛，为旷古所未有。钢铁加番，粮食加番；人民公社，遍布全国；影响所及，震动世界。真是歌声喧四野，红旗满山川，到处洋溢着雄伟灿烂的新气象。
    我们吉林省各项建设事业，在党的统一领导下，同全国各地一样，都在蓬勃地发展着。一九五八年全省工业总产值，超额完成了国家计划，比上年增长了百分之四十九。一九五八年增长的产值绝对数，相当于第一个五年计划期间增长的总和。在农业方面，一九五八年虽然遭到三十年来未有的旱灾，但全省粮食总产量仍达到七百万吨，超额完成了国家计划，比一九五七年增长了百分之四十。一九五八年我省在发展工业和农业生产及完成人民公社化方面，都取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    过去的一年中，我们吉林省工商业者，在党的领导下，通过了反右派斗争和整风运动，受到了深刻的教育，在政治思想上有了不同程度的提高。在工农业生产大跃进形势推动下，很多人都投入了大跃进的行列。在全民大炼钢铁中，有不少人和职工一道，为了完成钢铁任务，积极地想办法，突破技术困难；在高温炉前不辞劳苦，不分昼夜地辛勤操作，甚至几夜不睡。在支援农业生产方面，不少人参加了抗旱、深翻土地和兴修水利等劳动，受到了公社和农民的表扬和鼓励。还有不少人在献技、献计，改善经营管理，改进服务态度，提合理化建议等方面，也作出了一定的贡献。在社会主义竞赛中，有些人还被评为先进生产者。从这些行动表现来看，可以说明我们工商业者多数人的政治思想面貌已有了显著的变化；在自我改造的道路上有了不小的进展。但是，这决不是说我们多数工商业者已经达到了从根本上改变资本主义立场为社会主义立场的程度，达到了摆脱两面性的程度。许多事实证明，我们工商业者还有许多人对接受党的领导还没有作到全心全意，不少人对自我改造还存在着不同程度的厌倦情绪；还有一些人在改造上有了一些进步表现，就错误地认为改造得差不多了，不再需要进行政治立场的根本改造，只是思想改造的问题了。从以上存在的问题来看，无论在工作和劳动中，同劳动人民比起来，还相差得很远，与当前飞跃发展的形势是不相适应的。
    今年三月间，我省工商业者经过传达与贯彻民建总会和全国工商联两会中执委联席（扩大）会议的精神和决议，并听了中共吉林省委、省人民委员会负责同志的指示，通过学习和讨论，在思想认识上有了进一步的提高，更加认识到必须继续加强政治立场和思想的根本改造，正如周总理在政府工作报告中所指出的，我们工商业者今后必须在参加社会主义建设的工作中，继续进行自我教育和自我改造。我们作为一个还没有达到根本改造的、还没有转化成为劳动者的资产阶级分子，在祖国社会主义建设飞跃发展的形势之下，继续进行根本改造，就更显得必要了。为此，当前必须继续在积极地为社会主义建设事业服务中，极力克服不正确思想和认识，树立改造的光荣感，不断地增强改造的自觉性，才是正确的途径。我们工商业者要想达到根本改造的目的，就必须在党的领导下，把改造与服务紧密地结合起来，从服务中加强改造，在改造中积极服务。改造和服务是不可分离的整体，两者的关系是互相促进的，改造得越好，服务就会越好。如果离开了服务实践，空谈改造，是不可想像的。因此，我们在自我改造的过程中，必须本着以政治思想改造为统帅，以劳动和实践为基础，以企业或工作岗位为基地，并把这三者结合起来的方针，加强自我改造，积极为社会主义建设服务。
    当前，祖国的社会主义建设事业突飞猛进，劳动人民的干劲冲天，对于我们工商业者的改造是极大的鼓励和推动，同时也为我们积极服务提供了有利条件。作为一个爱国的工商业者，生活在这样的伟大时代里，深深感到无限的光荣和责任的重大。我们一定要拿出所有的力量，奋勇前进，在为社会主义服务中贡献出一技之长或一得之见，方不负党对我们工商业者在改造中所寄予的温暖和关怀。为了实现改造与服务的重大要求，必须作到忠诚老实地接受党的领导；踏踏实实地向工人阶级学习；经常不断地检查和修订自我改造的规划；自觉自愿地参加体力劳动；毫无保留地贡献出自己的技术和才能。为了充实政治头脑，更要加强政治理论和时事政策学习，特别是对毛主席著作的学习，并积极参加各项政治活动。在执行上述各项条件时，要学习运用好批评与自我批评，互相帮助，相互促进。逐步破资产阶级立场和思想，立社会主义立场和思想，才能从一个剥削者改造成为一个大体上符合毛主席指示的六项政治标准的自食其力的劳动者。
    最近，西藏一小撮上层反动分子，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，发动武装叛乱，梦想破坏祖国统一和民族团结，要把西藏人民永远置于黑暗、残酷的农奴制度下，这是全国人民不能容忍的。我们吉林省工商业者，对此表示万分愤慨。我们坚决拥护周总理在报告中提出的关于平息西藏叛乱的各项措施。西藏是中国的领土，不容任何人阴谋进行分裂。平息西藏的叛乱，是我们的内政，不容任何外国人干涉。现在英帝国主义和印度干涉主义分子的阴谋，已经遭到了我国各族广大人民的一致反对。但是印度干涉主义分子及其某些政治活动家，竟不顾和平共处的五项原则，粗暴地干涉我国内政，对我国进行诬蔑和挑衅。印度警察当局甚至纵容扩张主义分子进行“示威”，公然在我国驻孟买领事馆前污辱毛主席像。这是对我国六亿五千万人民的挑衅行为，对此我们表示极大的愤怒。我们警告这些干涉者和反动分子：头脑要放冷静些，我们已经站立起来的国家，正在满怀信心地建设社会主义的中国人民，不是软弱可欺的，什么阴谋诡计也阻止不了我们的前进。我们坚信西藏人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在全国各族人民的帮助下，一定会摆脱落后、黑暗和残酷的农奴制度，建设成民主、幸福的新西藏。
    一九五九年是我们祖国国庆十周年，是我们争取更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年。我们处于这样惊天动地的不平凡的时代里，壮丽的未来，使我们每一个人莫不充满着信心和希望。我们工商业者，在党的领导和教育下，一定要鼓足干劲，力争上游，加强改造，积极服务，同全国人民一道，更好地为祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业贡献出一切力量。
