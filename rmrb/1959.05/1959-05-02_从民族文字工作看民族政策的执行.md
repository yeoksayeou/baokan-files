Comrade Chairman, Fellow Committee Members, Fellow Comrades:

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I am determined to contribute my efforts to the several tasks that the CPPCC should strengthen in the future as proposed in the report. At the same time, I will definitely continue to study assiduously Marxist-Leninist theory and Chairman Mao's works, transforming myself into a scientific worker who can take Marxism-Leninism as the highest guide at any time and on any issue, and wholeheartedly serve our socialist construction and communist construction.

I sincerely support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou's report pointed out extremely clearly and correctly the great achievements of China's Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the direction of the national people's efforts in the future. This is a scientific summary of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and also a guide for us to continue the Great Leap Forward. This report most powerfully demonstrates how the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao correctly and creatively apply Marxism-Leninism when leading China's socialist revolution, socialist construction, and handling major international events. We firmly believe that the national people will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the various national construction tasks of 1959 under the guidance and encouragement of this report, thereby guaranteeing the comprehensive and victorious completion of the Second Five-Year Plan.

From the fact that the increase in China's steel and coal production reached the speed of Britain's fifty years in six years, from the fact that the quantity of China's industrial and agricultural products in one year of 1958 exceeded the quantity increased in the previous five years, from the fact that the socialist and communist consciousness of the broad masses of the Chinese people has universally grown and created many miracles that not only caused a sensation in the country but also caused a sensation in the world, our pace towards a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture is getting faster and faster.

Premier Zhou has pointed out in the Government Work Report: "Many ethnic minorities who had no written languages in the past now have formulated writing schemes and have books and newspapers published in their own languages." I am an ethnic language research worker, please allow me to briefly report to you, the committee members, the brilliant achievements the Party has made in the ethnic minority language work based on my personal experience.

All ethnic groups who proposed and determined to create written languages have already got them.

China has more than fifty ethnic minorities. In the old society, the majority of ethnic groups had no written languages. Some of the original written languages were incomplete and not commonly used. Imperialist elements maliciously provoked ethnic groups on China's Yunnan border, saying: "The Communist Party can give you farm tools and cattle, but they cannot give you written languages." If we take their provocation as an "estimate," it is now proved that their estimate was completely wrong. In order to correctly solve the ethnic minority language problem, the Party organized more than 700 Han and ethnic minority cadres and students from the Institute of Ethnic Languages ​​of the Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Central Ethnic Publishing House, Peking University, local language institutions, and other relevant institutions, and divided them into seven large language survey teams to go deep into the ethnic minority areas to study their languages. After fully grasping the language and other related situations of the ethnic groups, they launched the work of helping those ethnic groups who needed to create or reform written languages to formulate writing schemes. By August 1958, they had helped thirteen ethnic groups formulate writing schemes. Most of them had never had written languages in history. Now we report the good news to the Party, and report the good news to you, the committee members, all the ethnic groups who proposed and determined to create written languages have already got written languages that can perfectly express their languages, are convenient for them to learn and use, and are warmly welcomed by them.

In our country, all scientific research must serve socialist construction. The newly created written languages are no exception, they are already promoting the cultural revolution and technological revolution in ethnic minority areas, and are increasingly meeting the needs of production and construction. For example, the Zhuang ethnic group in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has a population of more than six million, and has never had a written language that can perfectly express their language. The newly created written language, after only one year of promotion in 1958, has attracted 90 percent of the Zhuang youth and middle-aged illiterates in the autonomous region, which is 2.9 million people, to participate in the learning of the Zhuang language, and more than 700,000 of them have already mastered their own written language. In the areas where Zhuang language is promoted, cadres and primary and secondary school teachers who already know Chinese generally also master Zhuang language. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1.6 million big-character posters, more than 1.54 million Great Leap Forward poems, and more than 900,000 articles were written in Zhuang language in 1958 alone. In terms of publications, the achievements are also amazing. By the end of 1958, 343 kinds of books in Zhuang language had been published, with more than 9.6 million copies. The circulation of Zhuang language newspapers is also very high. In order to more deeply understand the situation of learning and using Zhuang language among the masses, I went to the Du'an Yao Autonomous County in the autonomous region this spring. This county has more than 420,000 Zhuang people, more than 110,000 Yao people, and three other ethnic groups with smaller populations, totaling more than 560,000 people. I saw everywhere in the fields of the people's commune and on the construction sites of the reservoir that everyone had a satchel and every small team had a blackboard. The vast majority of them have already escaped illiteracy and are using their spare time to consolidate and improve Zhuang language. Zhuang language learning and labor production are not only not contradictory in terms of time, but also well integrated in content. Although they have certain textbooks, they supplement whatever teaching materials they need for whatever work they do. Therefore, everyone loves learning more and more as they labor, and loves labor more and more as they learn. In such a county with a population of 560,000, from April to October in 1958 alone, 282,410 big-character posters were written, 612,312 new folk songs were created, and more than 60,000 articles were written. In addition, Zhuang language was used for assigning work, challenge letters, response letters, letters reporting good news to the Party committee, notices exchanging production experiences, recording reports, writing diaries, and writing radio scripts. With Zhuang language, cultural and recreational life has also become more convenient and active. This autonomous county already has 139 amateur troupes with 41,000 people participating, and in addition to Chinese scripts, some Zhuang language scripts have also been written. In addition, there are 1,000 singing groups and 50,000 mountain song groups, and everywhere you can hear pleasant songs and see gratifying smiles, whether on the hillside or on the plain. They sing spiritedly:

    Walk three steps out the door and sing, sing several baskets full;
    Sing so the green hills turn around and around, sing so the river water rolls down the hillside.
    My heart opens when I mention mountain songs, strength comes when I sing mountain songs;
    Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to create, dare to go to Beijing to set up a challenge arena.

After the Zhuang people got written languages, they compared the present with the past, and remembered the source of drinking water, and kindly realized that they should thank the Communist Party for getting a happy life today. They sang like this:

    Thinking of the past, tears streamed down, no food to eat, no clothes to wear,
    Cultural learning was out of the question, opening our eyes and asking people to lead us by the hand;
    Today, we have the Communist Party, and all ethnic groups have turned themselves over,
    Everyone already has culture, opening the golden lock of happiness.

From the situation that many ethnic minorities quickly got written languages, and the masses quickly learned written languages and used written languages very widely and vividly, we can clearly see that as long as an ethnic group needs to create written languages, the Party will give it written languages, and the quality of these written languages is very high. The imperialist elements should be speechless in the face of eloquent facts, right?

In the ethnic language work, the Party's policy of walking on two legs has also been implemented. Because the specific situations and wishes of each ethnic group that originally had no written languages are different, not every ethnic group that originally had no written languages creates written languages. Some ethnic groups have already partially used or are already familiar with the languages of other ethnic groups. If the people of this ethnic group think that there is no need to create a separate written language, they can choose the written language of other ethnic groups that is suitable for them according to their specific conditions and voluntariness. For example, the Du'an Yao people mentioned above, most of whom are familiar with the Zhuang language, chose the Zhuang language; a small number who do not know the Zhuang language but are familiar with Chinese, chose the Chinese language. Not only ethnic groups without written languages can choose to use Chinese language according to their voluntariness, many ethnic groups with their own written languages also enthusiastically request to learn Chinese language in addition to fully using their own ethnic languages. This request is gradually being met.

The Tibetan language and writing have been greatly developed, and the facts prove that the "statement" issued by Indian diplomatic officials is full of lies.

For the existing common languages, if it is necessary to reform them and the people of this ethnic group request to reform them, they will be helped to formulate new writing schemes; if the people of this ethnic group think that there is no need to reform them and are willing to continue to use them, they can use the original written languages for a long time. The Party and the government fully help them develop languages ​​and writings in accordance with the wishes of the people of this ethnic group and the needs of socialist construction. For example, the Tibetan language and writing, like other common ethnic languages, has been greatly developed. This is also clearly stipulated in the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Article 9 of the agreement says:

    "According to the actual situation in Tibet, the Tibetan language, writing, and school education should be gradually developed."

Now we can see how seriously the Party and the Central People's Government have implemented this provision. Before liberation, only Kangding had a Tibetan newspaper; after liberation, not only Lhasa had a Tibetan newspaper, but also five Tibetan newspapers in other Tibetan areas. Before liberation, there was no Tibetan magazine; after liberation, seven Tibetan magazines were published. Before liberation, the number of books published in Tibetan was very small except for Buddhist scriptures; after liberation, the Central Ethnic Publishing House alone published 408 kinds of books in Tibetan from 1953 to 1958, with 3.78 million copies. These 408 kinds of books include Marxist-Leninist classics, political theory, literature and art, history, language, and cultural education. Among them, there are "Chinese Buddhism" and "Collection of Buddha Statues of Sakyamuni" on religion. The Map Publishing House also published Chinese maps and world maps in Tibetan. The books (including school textbooks) and reprinted Buddhist scriptures published in relevant provinces and Tibetan areas are not included in the calculation. This is the development of Tibetan language and writing from the scope and quantity of publications. From the perspective of the Tibetan language itself, the Tibetan standard language has also been greatly enriched and developed since liberation. The most significant thing is the increase in a large number of new words and terms in social politics and science and technology. Vivid, lively, fresh, and powerful new phrases and idioms, such as "on-site meeting," "technical revolution," "politics in command," "liberating the mind," "both red and expert," "automobile trainization," "a single spark can start a prairie fire," etc., are all translated into Tibetan according to the grammar of the Tibetan language. This enables the Tibetan language to accurately and vividly express any complex ideological system and all new things that the Tibetan people need it to express. Therefore, we say that the Tibetan standard language has been greatly enriched and developed, and it does not seem to be exaggerated at all. From the perspective of school education, before liberation, Tibet did not even have a primary school. Now there are not only primary schools, but also middle schools. Is this not an unprecedented development of school education in Tibet?

Ironclad facts prove that on the side of the Central People's Government, Article 9 of the seventeen-article agreement, like the other sixteen articles, has been earnestly and strictly implemented. Let's take another look at how the former Tibetan local government implemented the seventeen-article agreement. The agreement stipulates that "the Tibetan local government should carry out reforms voluntarily," but they not only insisted on not changing, but also intensified the exploitation of serfs and used more inhumane cruel punishments; the agreement stipulates that "the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people should be respected," but they arbitrarily desecrated temples and even killed patriotic living Buddhas; the agreement stipulates that the Tibetan local government should unite the Tibetan people to "expel the imperialist forces from Tibet," "implement ethnic regional autonomy," and "gradually reorganize the Tibetan army into the People's Liberation Army," but they tried every possible means to prevent the realization of ethnic regional autonomy, colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, shielded bandits, opposed the Tibetan people, and finally launched an armed rebellion, attacking the People's Liberation Army, attempting to split Tibet from the motherland and turn it into a colony and protectorate of foreign countries. These alone are enough to prove that they not only did not abide by the agreement, but also tore up the agreement. The so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" recently distributed by Indian diplomatic officials actually ignores all the facts and says that the Tibetan local government had made its best efforts to abide by the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. This is simply full of lies. These lies could not possibly have come from the Dalai Lama, they must have been imposed on him by others. We should turn our indignation into strength and severely refute and counterattack this "statement." We solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists that Tibet will always be the territory of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan people must take the socialist road. Any attempt to undermine the unity of our motherland and drag the Tibetan people into the dark abyss is doomed to failure. We have truth, we have justice, we have leadership, we have the Party that is constantly moving from victory to victory, the invincible People's Liberation Army, and the unbreakable unity of 650 million people. No matter what rumors this small group of enemies creates or what despicable and evil means they adopt, they will not damage the great People's Republic of China in the slightest; the only possible result is that this small group of people themselves announce their cunning, evil, insidious, shameless, weakness, powerlessness, and political immaturity to the world. In this way, the true face of the Indian expansionists will be exposed to the people of the world, and our great neighbor India will also suffer undue harm.

Comrades, let us the national people unite closely under the leadership of the Party and strive to completely smash all conspiracies that attempt to undermine the unity and honor of our motherland, and to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in our country's great socialist construction!

### 从民族文字工作看民族政策的执行

专栏：

    从民族文字工作看民族政策的执行
    傅懋勣委员的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意李维汉副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，并决心在报告所提出的今后政协应该加强的几项工作中，贡献出自己的力量。同时，我一定继续刻苦努力地学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛主席的著作，把自己改造成一个不论在任何时候，不论在任何问题上，都能够以马克思列宁主义为最高指针的科学工作者，忠心耿耿地为我国社会主义建设和共产主义建设服务。
    我竭诚拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。周总理的报告极其鲜明而且正确的指出了一九五八年我国大跃进的伟大成就和今后全国人民努力的方向。这是一九五八年大跃进的科学总结，也是我们继续大跃进的指针。这个报告最有力地显示了党中央和毛主席在领导我国社会主义革命、社会主义建设和处理国际重大事件的时候，怎样正确地创造性地运用着马克思列宁主义。我们坚决相信，全国人民定能在这个报告的指导和鼓舞下，完成和超额完成一九五九年国家各项建设任务，从而保证了第二个五年计划的全面地胜利地完成。
    从我国钢和煤产量的增加，都以六年的时间达到了英国五十年的速度来看，从一九五八年一年内我国工农业产品的数量超过了前五年增加的数量来看，从我国广大人民群众社会主义和共产主义觉悟的普遍增长并且创造了不只轰动全国而且轰动全世界的许多奇迹来看，我们向一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家前进的步伐，越走越快了。
    周总理在政府工作报告中，已经指出：“有许多过去没有文字的少数民族，现在已经制定了文字方案，有了用自己的文字出版的书籍和报纸。”我是一个民族语文研究工作干部，请允许我根据个人体会，向各位委员简要地汇报一下，党在少数民族文字工作方面所取得的辉煌成就。
    所有提出并且确定要创制文字的兄弟民族都已经有了文字
    我国有五十多个少数民族。在旧社会中没有文字的民族占大多数。在原有文字中也有一些不完备、不通用的。帝国主义分子曾经恶意地挑拨我国云南边疆上的民族说：“共产党能给你们农具和耕牛，但是不能给你们文字。”如果我们把他们的挑拨作为“估计”来看，现在证明：他们的估计完全错了。党为了正确地解决少数民族文字问题，组织了科学院少数民族语言研究所、中央民族学院、中央民族出版社、北京大学、地方语文机构和其他有关机构的汉族及少数民族干部和学生共七百多人，分成七个大型的语言调查工作队，深入到少数民族地区去研究他们的语言。在全面地掌握了民族的语言和其他有关情况以后，就展开了帮助那些需要创制或改革文字的民族制定文字方案的工作。到一九五八年八月为止，已经帮助十三个民族制定了文字方案。其中大多数是有史以来没有过文字的。现在我们向党报喜，向各位委员报喜，所有提出并且确定要创制文字的民族，都已经得到了能完善地表达他们的语言、便于他们学习使用而且为他们热烈欢迎的文字了。
    在我国，一切科学研究都必须为社会主义建设服务。新创制的各种文字也毫不例外地已经在推动着民族地区的文化革命和技术革命，并且越来越多地满足着生产建设的需要。例如，广西僮族自治区的僮族有六百多万人口，一向没有过能完善地表达自己的语言的文字。新创制出来的文字仅仅经过一九五八年一年的推行时间，在自治区僮族人民的青壮年文盲中，已经有百分之九十的二百九十万人参加了僮文的学习，其中有七十多万人已经掌握了自己的文字。在推广僮文的地区，已经会汉文的干部和中小学教师一般也都掌握了僮文。根据不完全的统计，在一九五八年一年内用僮文写的大字报有一百六十多万张，大跃进诗歌一百五十四万多首，文章九十多万篇。从出版物方面看，成绩也是惊人的。到一九五八年底，用僮文出版的书有三百四十三种，九百六十多万册。僮文报发行的数量也很高。为了更深切地了解僮文在人民群众中学习和使用的情况，今年春天我到了这个自治区的都安瑶族自治县。这个县有僮族四十二万多人，瑶族十一万多人，再加上其他人口较少的三个民族，共有五十六万多人。我在人民公社的田地里和水库工地上，处处看见每个人都有一个书包，每个小队都有一块黑板。他们绝大多数已经脱了盲，正在利用休息的时间巩固提高僮文。僮文学习和劳动生产不只在时间上没有矛盾，而且在内容上也结合得很好。他们虽然有一定的课本，但是做什么工作就补充什么教材。因此，大家越劳动越爱学习，越学习越爱劳动。在这样一个五十六万人口的县里，仅只从一九五八年四月到十月，就写了大字报二十八万二千四百一十张，创作了新民歌六十一万二千三百一十二首，文章有六万多篇。此外，派工牌、挑战书、应战书、向党委报喜的信、交流生产经验的通告、记录报告、写日记、写广播稿都用上了僮文。由于有了僮文，文娱生活也更加方便和活跃起来了。这个自治县已经有四万一千人参加的一百三十九个业余剧团，在汉文剧本以外，也写了一些僮文的剧本。另外还有一千个歌咏组和五万个山歌组，无论是在山坡上或是在平地上，到处听见愉快的歌声，到处看见欣慰的笑容。他们意气风发地唱着：
    出门三步就唱歌，一唱就是几大箩；
    唱得青山团团转，唱得河水滚山坡。
    提起山歌心就开，唱出山歌劲就来；
    敢想敢说敢创造，敢到北京摆擂台。
  僮族人民有了文字以后，将今比昔，饮水思源，亲切地体会到，今天得到幸福生活，应该感谢共产党，他们这样唱：
    想起从前泪涟涟，没有吃来没有穿，
    文化学习谈不上，睁着眼睛要人牵；
    今天有了共产党，各族人民把身翻，
    已经人人有文化，打开幸福金锁关。
    我们从许多少数民族很快地得到了文字和人民群众很快地学会了文字、很广泛很生动地使用着文字的情况，可以显然看出，只要一个民族需要创制文字，党就会给它文字，而且这种文字的质量是很高的。帝国主义分子在雄辩的事实面前，应该哑口无言了吧？
    在民族文字工作上，也贯彻了党提出的两条腿走路的方针。因为各个原来没有文字的民族的具体情况和愿望有所不同，并不是每个原来没有文字的民族都创制文字。有些民族已经部分使用或者已经熟悉了其他民族语言，如果本民族人民认为不需要单独创制文字，就按照他们的具体条件和自愿，选择对他们适用的其他民族的文字。例如，上边谈到的都安瑶族，大部分熟悉僮语的，选用了僮文；小部分不会僮语而熟悉汉语的，选用了汉文。不只没有文字的民族可以按照他们的自愿自择选用汉文，许多有了自己的文字的民族，在充分使用本族文字以外，也热情地要求学习汉语文。这种要求正在逐渐地得到满足。
    藏族语言文字得到很大发展，事实证明印度外交官员散发的“声明”满篇瞎话
    对于原有的通用文字，如果需要改革而本民族人民又要求改革，就帮助他们制定新文字方案；如果本族人民认为不需要改革，愿意继续使用，就可以长期使用原有文字。党和政府完全按照本民族人民的意愿和社会主义建设的需要，尽力帮助他们发展语言文字。例如藏族的语言文字和其他通用的民族文字一样，就得到了很大的发展。这在和平解放西藏办法十七条协议中也有明确的规定。协议第九条说：
    “依据西藏的实际情况，逐步发展西藏民族的语言、文字和学校教育。”
    我们现在可以看看党和中央人民政府是怎样认真地贯彻执行了这一条规定。解放以前，整个藏族地区只有康定出过一种藏文小报；解放以后，不只在拉萨有一种藏文报，再加上其他藏族地区，已经有五种藏文报。解放以前，没有一种藏文的杂志；解放以后，发行了七种藏文杂志。解放以前，用藏文出版的书籍除了佛经以外，数量是很少的；解放以后，仅只在中央民族出版社，从一九五三年到一九五八年就用藏文出版了书籍四百零八种，发行三百七十八万册。这四百零八种书包括马克思列宁主义经典著作、政治理论、文艺、历史、语言和文化教育等内容。其中有关宗教方面的有“中国佛教”、“释迦牟尼佛像集”等。地图出版社还出版了藏文的中国地图和世界地图。在有关省和藏族地区出版的书籍（包括学校教科书）和重印的佛经都没计算在内。这是从出版物的范围和数量来看藏族语言文字的发展情况。从藏语本身来看，在解放以后藏族标准语也得到了巨大的丰富和发展。最显著的是增加了大量的社会政治和科学技术方面的新词术语。生动活泼、新鲜有力的新的词组和成语，如“现场会议”、“技术革命”、“政治挂帅”、“解放思想”、“又红又专”、“汽车列车化”、“星星之火，可以燎原”等，都按照藏语的文法翻译成藏语。这就使藏语能够准确生动地表达藏族人民需要它表达的任何复杂的思想体系和一切新事物。因此，我们说藏族标准语得到了巨大的丰富和发展，并不显得有丝毫的夸大。从学校教育看，解放以前，西藏连一所小学也没有，现在不只有了小学，而且有了中学，这难道不是史无前例地发展了西藏的学校教育吗？
    铁一般的事实，证明了在中央人民政府方面，十七条协议的第九条同其他十六条一样，一直被认真地严格地执行着。我们再看看原西藏地方政府怎么执行十七条协议。协议规定“西藏地方政府应自动进行改革”，可是他们不但坚持不改，而且变本加厉地加重了对农奴的剥削，更多地使用惨无人道的酷刑；协议规定“尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯”，他们却任意沾污寺院，甚至杀死爱国的活佛；协议规定西藏地方政府应当团结西藏人民“驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏”，“实行民族区域自治”，“西藏军队逐步改编为人民解放军”，他们却百般阻止民族区域自治的实现，同帝国主义和外国反动派勾结起来，掩护叛匪，与西藏人民为敌、最后发动武装叛乱，向人民解放军进攻，企图把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，变为外国的殖民地和保护国。仅仅这一些就足以证明，他们不但没遵守协议，而且撕毁了协议。最近由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”中，竟抹杀一切事实地说，西藏地方政府曾尽最大的力量遵守和平解放西藏办法十七条协议。这简直是满篇瞎话。这些瞎话决不可能是出自达赖喇嘛，肯定是别人强加于他的。我们应该把愤慨化为力量，对这个“声明”加以严厉的驳斥和回击。我们正告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，西藏永远是中华人民共和国的领土，西藏人民一定要走社会主义道路，任何破坏我们祖国统一和把西藏人民拉向黑暗的无底深渊的企图，都注定要一败涂地。我们有真理，有正义，有领导，我们有不断地从胜利走向胜利的党、有战无不胜的人民解放军、有六万万五千万人民牢不可破的团结，不管这一小撮敌人制造什么谣言，采取什么卑鄙恶劣的手段，都不会损伤伟大的中华人民共和国的分毫；唯一可能的结果是，这一小撮人自己向全世界宣布了他们的狡猾、恶劣、阴毒、无耻、虚弱无力和政治幼稚病。这样一来，印度扩张主义分子的真面目就暴露在世界人民的面前，而我们伟大的邻邦印度也会受到不应有的损害。
    同志们，让我们全国人民紧密地团结在党的领导下，为彻底粉碎一切企图破坏我们祖国的统一和荣誉的阴谋，为在我国伟大的社会主义建设中，实现更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗吧！
