Comrades,

A few days ago, I listened to Premier Zhou's report, which filled me with excitement. Like everyone else, I fully support this report and firmly believe that the country's current goals and the beautiful prospects of the future will inevitably become reality. This historically significant and great document is a heroic epic sung by 600 million people, with rich and comprehensive content. I will study it carefully and use it as a guide for my future actions. Now, I will only talk about my personal understanding of the third part, "Tasks on the Cultural and Educational Front," and, combined with my work, offer a few superficial suggestions.

In the ten years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, 650 million people, full of courage and confidence, have been carrying out the socialist revolution in a planned and step-by-step manner - class struggle, ideological transformation, production and construction, and the communalization of rural people. This can be said to be the practice of a new and highest morality for mankind. The achievements in various fields will not only accelerate the pace of our country's socialist construction, but will inevitably become a part of the driving force of the world revolution. The revolutionary truth of the two great teachers, Marx and Lenin, has once again been victoriously proven in the East. Individual work is subordinate to the whole. Everything must be done in accordance with the correct leadership of the Party, proceeding from objective needs, and constantly improving and enhancing, in order to achieve greater leaps forward and harvests. I have thus gained a deeper understanding.

I am a cultural relic worker, currently engaged in research work at the Museum of History and the Palace Museum. The museum business is a relatively new project in the cultural sector, but thanks to the Party's attention, its development in the past ten years has been unprecedented and astonishing in the world. Taking the number of cultural relics unearthed along with infrastructure construction projects in the past ten years as an example, it has already exceeded two million pieces, which indirectly reflects the comprehensiveness of the motherland's industrial construction and directly provides very rich materials for new historical scientific research. Many blank spots in history have been newly filled. Requiring the past to serve the present, thousands of exquisitely made and beautifully patterned ancient crafts will undoubtedly inspire the creative enthusiasm of new artists and produce new works with a rich national artistic spirit.

The new goal of museum work is "to serve the broad masses of people, to serve academic research, and to serve production." In the past few years, comrades working in this department across the country have been full of enthusiasm and have made many efforts. Last year, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, cultural relics were brought to the countryside and factories, and there was a new development. The History Museum's information supply work has been in contact with about 300 units of national institutes, schools, factories, departments, and educational institutions of the People's Liberation Army. The Palace Museum, in addition to a large number of supplementary cultural relics, supported brother museums in provinces and cities. In 1958, in response to the requests of various provinces and cities, eight different exhibitions were held simultaneously, with larger exhibitions featuring 1,500 important cultural relics. For example, it also assisted in improving the special handicraft production in Beijing and held thematic exhibitions in several factories. In 1958, the total number of visitors reached 4 million. Even so, it is still far behind the reality.

After the nationwide rural communalization, the society as a whole made rapid progress, and "better patterns" for a series of daily-use light industrial products have become an almost universal call. In addition, due to the expansion of foreign trade figures, the improvement and enhancement of pattern design for special handicrafts and silk textiles are also particularly urgent. For the development of production, it is extremely important to protect old artists and train successors. Although the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Textile Industry have long paid attention to these matters and taken many measures, such as the establishment of the Bureau of Arts and Crafts by the Ministry of Light Industry, in addition to investigating and studying production conditions and problems, they also regularly hold various on-site production meetings and sample observation meetings to exchange experiences. Various provinces and cities have successively established arts and crafts research institutes, concentrating some old artists, and making proper arrangements for their material life and political treatment. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, in addition to the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, art schools in various provinces and cities have added arts and crafts departments or ceramic printing and dyeing departments, and established short-term pattern training courses, transferring production cadres to study and improve. Intermediate arts and crafts schools in Beijing, Nanjing, and Suzhou have all implemented the new system of combining education and production. Each department has production workshops, and experienced old artists guide production practice. The arts and crafts research institutes in Beijing and Suzhou have played an active role in improving the special handicraft production in the two places. The Wengong Society and Shengli Factory in Hangzhou, the Silk Research Institute in Suzhou, and the Nanjing Brocade Research Institute have played a decisive role in improving the weaving methods of silk brocade patterns in various regions, and have achieved great results.

But in general, the allocation of manpower and the preparation of materials are still difficult to adapt to the requirements of rapid development in production. Because many new silk weaving and printing factories in various provinces and cities are being established one after another, and the types of renovation work such as enamel, glass, and plastics are increasing day by day. Pianos, sewing machines, radios, phonographs, new living room furniture, stationery, and several new export products also require decorations with a distinct national artistic style. Good flowers and good styles cannot be produced out of thin air, so "learning from the heritage and making the past serve the present" has been put on the agenda due to the situation. This work should have been solved by art education institutions, but it cannot be solved well. Because up to now, in fact, each school still lacks a Chinese art history that focuses on labor art, has a relatively correct viewpoint, comprehensive materials, and clear organization, and meets teaching needs. Although art schools often have departments such as sculpture, ceramics, block printing, and printing and dyeing, they also lack relevant specialized art history textbooks. Especially in the field of arts and crafts, "learning from the heritage" is still not very down-to-earth in most teaching. It is naturally a question whether the students who are taught can selectively accept the national heritage and comprehensively apply it to new production.

However, the situation in the production field is that, whether it is piecework production, such as cloisonné, carved lacquer, jade carving, carpets, ivory, and embroidery in Beijing, where 20,000 people are often engaged in production, or silk satin produced in Suzhou and Hangzhou with electric motors at a rate of hundreds of millions of meters per year, as well as colored printed fabrics produced for domestic sales in various provinces and cities across the country, which have even larger figures, all require diversified patterns. Exports especially welcome artistic styles unique to China's national crafts. Only by being good at learning from excellent heritage and fully developing and applying it can a new blooming of a hundred flowers be formed, which can have a better impact internationally and also suit the happy mood of hundreds of millions of people at home. Therefore, museums "serving research and production" obviously need to face this reality squarely and take some new efforts and concrete measures in order to play their due role.

Due to the above situation, I have the following superficial suggestions:

First, in order to solve the problem of national art history teaching, it seems that the Palace Museum, the History Museum, the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Academy of Arts and Crafts can be considered as the main forces, and some manpower from other colleges and universities can be appropriately transferred to work together to try to compile a comprehensive Chinese art history and specialized art histories such as ceramics, silk, sculpture, jade, stone, bamboo, ivory, and metal processing in the shortest possible time.

Second, in order to enrich teaching content and provide information for production, museums should cooperate with film studios to produce several comprehensive and specialized art education films (this kind of documentary film suitable for art teaching will also play a good role in the art education of the broad masses).

Third, in order to provide information and promote art education universally, museums should obtain further cooperation with art publishing houses or the General Post Office to compile and print three to five hundred kinds of important art catalogs and thousands of kinds of art postcards, and supply them to the country at low prices.

Fourth, important domestic cultural relic collection institutions should accelerate the replenishment of manpower, strengthen research work and external service work. Brother museums and institutions should also further cooperate, exchange photographic catalog cards of collections, establish a joint card data room for important cultural relic collections, and then help domestic provincial and municipal libraries, university literature and history departments, and art schools and arts and crafts research institutes to establish comprehensive or specialized data rooms, so that research and production institutions can use these materials and achieve universal improvement.

Fifth, teachers in the literature and history departments of major middle schools, teachers in art schools, and old artists who guide production should be encouraged to study and improve themselves in museums during holidays or at ordinary times, and provide more convenience and help in terms of work and materials (if conditions permit, establish a special research room and arrange accommodation).

The purpose of these five suggestions is only one, that is, to accelerate the socialist cultural construction of our country, so that thousands of ancient objects can "serve the present," and new historical scientific research can be rapidly promoted on the basis of combining cultural relics and literature for mutual understanding. In terms of art education, the original conservative and backward teaching methods that ignored the national tradition and the achievements of the working people can be completely changed. In terms of art production, the countless exquisite and magnificent works of art created by the wisdom and ingenuity of millions of working people for thousands of years can still serve new production in the new society. Let the young shoots of the new generation—young artists—be rooted in the original fertile cultural and artistic soil, absorb more nutrients, and bloom more magnificent and healthy flowers. Whether these hopes can be realized first requires all parties to strengthen cooperation on a new common understanding. Therefore, it is put forward as a reference for all members who are concerned about cultural relic work, and I hope to get your advice.

　　关于文物“古为今用”问题
    沈从文委员的发言各位委员：
    前几天，听过周总理的报告，使我无限兴奋。我和各位一样，完全拥护这个报告，并且深深相信，国家当前努力的指标，和明日美好的远景，都必然会成为现实。这个有历史性的重要伟大文件，是六亿人民合唱的英雄史诗，内容包罗宏富，我要好好学习，作为今后行为的指南。现在仅就第三部分“文化教育战线上的任务”来谈谈个人的体会，并结合工作，提出几点粗浅的建议。建国十年来，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席正确领导下，六亿五千万人民充满勇气和信心，有计划、有步骤的进行社会主义革命——阶级斗争、思想改造、生产建设、农村人民公社化，可说是对于人类一种新的最高道德的实践，各方面取得的成绩，不仅能加速我国社会主义建设的前进的速度，必然还会成为世界革命的动力一部分。马克思、列宁两个伟大导师的革命真理，在东方又一次得到胜利证明。个别工作从属于整体，凡事必需遵照着党的正确领导，从客观需要出发，不断改进和提高，才会得到更大的跃进和丰收，我因此也得到深一层理解。我是个文物工作者，目前在历史博物馆和故宫博物院搞研究工作。博物馆事业，在文化部门是个较新项目，但由于党的重视，十年来的发展，在世界上也是史无前例惊人迈进的。以近十年随同基建工程出土文物数字而言，就早已过二百万件，间接可反映祖国工业建设的全面性，直接却为新的历史科学研究提供了十分丰富的材料。历史上许多空白点，都得到新的充实。要求古为今用，万千种制作精美、花纹壮丽的古代工艺品，无疑还将启发新的艺术家创造热情，产生出富有民族艺术气魄的新作品。新的博物馆工作目标，是“为广大群众服务，为学术研究服务，为生产服务”，几年来，全国从事这部门工作同志，都充满热情，作过不少努力。去年在大跃进形势下，文物下乡下厂且有新的展开。历史博物馆资料供应工作，曾和全国院、校、厂、部和解放军教育机构约三百单位发生联系。故宫博物院除大量补拨文物，支援省市兄弟馆。一九五八年还应各省市要求，同时进行八个不同展出，较大的展出重要文物达一千五百件。又如协助改进北京市特种手工艺生产，并在几个工厂中作过专题展览。一九五八年观众总人数已达四百万。就这样，也依旧还远远落后于现实。全国农村公社化后，社会全面突飞猛进，对于一系列日用轻工业产品，“要好花样”几乎成为普遍呼声。又由于外贸数字扩大，对于特种手工艺品和丝绸纺织品，花纹设计的改进和提高，要求也格外迫切。为发展生产，保护老艺人，培养接班人，都极其重要。有关这些事情，轻工业部、文化部、纺织工业部，虽早已注意到，作了许多措施，如轻工业部特设有工艺美术局，除调查研究生产情况和问题，还经常不断举行各种生产现场会议和样品观摩会，交流经验。各省市先后都设立工艺美术研究所，集中了部分老艺人，在物质生活上和政治待遇上都作过妥当安排。去年大跃进以来，除中央工艺美术学院外，各省市美术学校，又多添设了工艺美术系或陶瓷印染专系，并成立短期图案花纹训练班，抽调生产干部来学习进修。北京、南京、苏州中级工艺学校，均已实行教育和生产相结合的新制度，各系都设有生产车间，由经验丰富老艺人指导生产实习。北京和苏州的工艺美术研究所，在改进两地特种手工艺品生产上，都起过积极作用。杭州的文工社、胜利厂，苏州的丝绸研究所，南京的云锦研究所，为改进诸地区丝绸锦缎花纹织法，更起过决定性作用，得到巨大成绩。但总的说来，人力配备和资料准备工作，还是难于适应在生产迅速发展中的要求。因为许多省市新的丝织印染厂在陆续建立，加之更新的工作如搪瓷、玻璃、塑料，品种日益增多，钢琴、缝纫机、收音机、留声机、新的客厅家具、文具，若干外销新产品，还要求有鲜明民族艺术风格装饰。好花好样子不可能凭空产生，因此“学习遗产古为今用”迫于形势被提上了日程。这个工作本应当由美术教育机构来解决，但是并不能很好解决。因为迄今为止，事实上各学校就还缺少一本以劳动艺术作重心、比较观点正确、材料全面、条理清楚的中国美术史，和满足教学需要。美术学校虽常设有雕塑、陶瓷、板画、印染等系，也缺少有关专题艺术史教材。特别是工艺美术部分，“学习遗产”在大部分教学中，就还不大踏实。希望所教出的学生，能有选择的接受民族遗产，综合运用到新的生产上去，自然是个问题。然而生产方面的情形，却是不论计件生产，在北京即经常有二万人从事生产的景泰蓝、雕漆、刻玉、地毯、象牙、挑补绣花，还是在苏杭使用电机生产年以亿万公尺计算的绸缎，以及全国各省市专为内销生产数字更大的彩色印花布，无不需要花纹图案多样化。外销则特别欢迎具有我国民族工艺特有的艺术风格。唯有善于从优秀遗产取法，充分加以发展运用，才会形成新的百花齐放，国际上可得到更好的影响，国内也才适合亿万人民的愉快心情。因此，博物馆“为研究和生产服务”，显然就必需正视这个现实，作些新的努力和具体措施，才会起应有的作用。由于上述情形，个人有如下几点粗浅建议：
    一、为解决全国美术史教学问题，似可考虑用故宫博物院、历史博物馆、科学院历史研究所、和中央美术学院、工艺美术学院等为主要力量，并酌调其他院校部分人力，协同合作来用尽短时间，试编写综合性中国艺术史，及专题性陶瓷、丝绸、雕塑中玉、石、竹、牙、金属加工等艺术简史。
    二、为充实教学内容并为生产上提供资料，博物院应和电影制片厂协作，摄制综合性和专题性美术教育电影若干部（这种适于美术教学的纪录电影，在广大群众美术教育方面，也会起良好作用）。
    三、为提供资料并普遍推广美术教育，博物馆应和美术出版社或邮政总局取得进一步协作，分门别类来编印三五百种重要美术图录，和千把种美术明信片，廉价供应全国。
    四、国内重要文物收藏机构，应加速充实人力，加强研究工作和对外服务工作。兄弟馆院并宜进一步协作，交换藏品摄影目录卡片，成立重要文物藏品联合卡片资料室，再帮助国内各省市图书馆、大学文史系、和美术学校、工艺美术研究所，建立综合或专门性资料室，使得研究和生产机构，都可利用这些材料，得到普遍的提高。
    五、宜鼓励各大中学文史系教师、美术学校教师、指导生产的老艺人，在假期或平时到博物馆学习进修，在工作上和资料上给予较多便利和帮助（有条件的或为设立专门研究室并安排食宿）。
    这五点建议，目的只有一个，即为加速我国社会主义文化建设，使万千种古物能“古为今用”，新的历史科学研究，在文物和文献相互结合认识基础上，得到迅速推进。艺术教育方面，原有的对民族传统忽视、对劳动人民成就忽视的保守落后教学方法，可一改旧观，艺术生产方面，也可使千百年来千百万劳动人民的智慧和巧思创造出的无数精美壮丽的艺术品，还能在新的社会为新的生产服务。让年轻一代的幼芽——青年艺术家能植根于原有的肥沃文化艺术土壤中，吸取更多的营养，开出更加壮丽健康的花朵。这些希望能否实现，首先需要各方面在一种新的共同认识上加强协作，因此提出来作为关心文物工作各委员参考，并盼得指教。
