　　Every Grain is Hard-Earned; Not a Single Grain Can Be Lost
　　Feidong Dianbu Commune Establishes Detailed Harvesting and Threshing Responsibility System
　　Pixian Calculates Three Accounts to Mobilize the Masses to Ensure All Grain is Returned to the Granary
　　Our newspaper Hefei dispatch, 28th: The Dianbu People's Commune in Feidong County, Anhui Province, mobilized the masses to summarize experience and establish a detailed harvesting and threshing responsibility system to ensure the quality of the summer harvest. Of the 27,200 mu of wheat in the Dianbu Commune, most is nearing maturity, and some has already begun to be harvested. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, the commune's Party committee organized commune members to discuss the issue of detailed harvesting and threshing. During the discussion, each production team summarized the experiences and lessons of past summer harvests. For example, the Yanggang Production Team planted 39 mu of "March Yellow" wheat last year, but due to untimely harvesting, 13 mu were affected by wind damage, resulting in a yield reduction of more than 20 jin per mu; the Xinxia Team had 6 mu of wheat stalks that were not thoroughly threshed, and later re-threshed them to obtain more than 70 jin of wheat. Through discussion, everyone agreed that one of the main reasons why wheat was not harvested and threshed cleanly in the past was the lack of a strict responsibility system. Based on the opinions of the commune members, the commune promptly formulated a "four fix" responsibility system for the summer harvest. First, fix the land: Each production team organizes a temporary rush-harvesting professional group of about ten people based on the strength of the labor force and technical expertise, and rationally allocates them according to the quality of the wheat and the distance of the plots, with specific responsibility assigned to each group. Second, fix the time: Based on the early or late maturity of the wheat, the dates for completion of harvesting are specified separately. "March Yellow" is harvested first, followed by "Nanda 2419", to ensure that each plot is harvested as it ripens. Third, fix the quality: Ensure that no ears are lost, no grains are dropped, and the wheat bundles are cut neatly. The method of inserting signs in the fields and handing them over to the groups for inspection and acceptance is adopted to facilitate inspection and acceptance; at the same time, harvesting and acceptance should be carried out on the same day, and those that do not meet the requirements of detailed harvesting and threshing should be re-harvested and threshed cleanly by the contracting group. Fourth, fix the work point remuneration: Work points for harvesting, transporting, and threshing are determined according to the quality of the wheat.
　　After the "four fix" responsibility system was implemented in the production teams, it was universally reflected that: after working hard from last year until now, we cannot afford to lose a single grain of wheat. Many commune members also formulated covenants for detailed harvesting and threshing, guaranteeing that: no ears will be lost when harvesting wheat, no grains will be detached when bundling, no grains will be scattered in the threshing ground, no ears will be wrapped in the wheat stalks, no grains will be hidden in the wheat ears, timely drying and storage in the granary, and prevention of damage by livestock and losses due to cloudy and rainy weather and mildew, etc. The 57 households of the Guowan Production Team, based on the agricultural work they were responsible for, formulated covenants for detailed harvesting and threshing, promoted the experience of harvesting quickly with small bundles, and organized more than 20 children to pick up wheat ears after harvesting, ensuring that no grain was lost. When the Central Brigade began harvesting wheat, it was somewhat rough at first. After inspection, the commune members were mobilized to re-thresh, yielding more than three jin per mu. The commune members calculated an account: If the more than 3,000 mu of wheat in the entire brigade were all harvested and threshed roughly, more than 9,000 jin would be lost. Everyone expressed that they must not be careless in harvesting and threshing in the future. At present, the more than 2,800 mu of wheat that have been harvested and threshed in the entire commune have generally met the requirements of "four cleanlinesses" (clean cutting, clean transporting, clean threshing, clean storage) after inspection and acceptance.
　　Our newspaper Chengdu dispatch, 28th: Farmers in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, are adopting the method of calculating three accounts in the summer harvest to mobilize the masses to further refine harvesting and threshing.
　　The work of rush-harvesting summer grain and rapeseed in Pixian County is proceeding intensely. Because emphasis was placed on careful threshing and harvesting from the beginning, the phenomenon of scattering and waste has decreased compared with the past. However, after in-depth inspection, the scattering phenomenon in individual production teams is still quite alarming. On May 19, commune member Yan Xiufeng (Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, placed here for labor) together with the county's inspection team, re-threshed and re-sifted a portion of the already threshed and sifted rapeseed "empty stalks" and "empty pods" in the Second Production Team of the First Management District of Chongxing Commune. As a result, 34 jin of rapeseed were re-threshed from the "empty stalks" and "empty pods" per mu. Adding the rapeseed swept and picked up from the fields and field edges, the average scattering was about 40 jin per mu. This rapeseed was harvested and threshed in sunny weather, so the scattering would be even greater when harvested and threshed in cloudy weather.
　　Based on this situation, everyone calculated three accounts at the time: If we calculate scattering at 40 jin per mu, the county's 100,200 mu of rapeseed can yield an additional 4,008,000 jin of rapeseed. At a price of 0.17 yuan per jin, this is worth more than 690,000 yuan. On average, each person in the county can get 2.64 yuan; 4,008,000 jin of rapeseed, yielding 40 jin of oil per 100 jin, yields a total of more than 1.6 million jin of oil, and each person in the county receives an average of 5.11 liang more oil; after 4,008,000 jin of rapeseed are pressed for oil, more than 2.57 million jin of by-product – sesame cakes – can be provided. Applying 30 jin per mu, can fertilize more than 85,000 mu of fields. Some commune members said: "Only after calculating this way can we see that the waste is really serious!" The cadres from various communes who participated in the inspection team also felt that this was a major issue and called home to tell their families to resolutely achieve careful threshing and harvesting.
　　Based on this inspection, the Pixian County Party Committee immediately made several provisions, urgently instructing all localities to further eliminate scattering and waste. These provisions are: Party organization secretaries, management district directors, production team leaders, and all working cadres must personally re-thresh one or two plots of rapeseed fields, set an example, hold on-site meetings, and calculate three accounts in public; stalks and shells that have not been re-threshed are not allowed to be used as fertilizer in the fields or as firewood. If there is no time to re-thresh at present, they should be properly stored so that they can be re-threshed when time is available; threshing grounds with mats should be established universally, and after threshing, the fallen grains on the ground should be swept clean; all these practices should also be adopted when harvesting wheat, green manure, and other summer-ripening crops; in re-threshing crops, ideological work should be carried out thoroughly.

    粒粒皆辛苦　一颗不能丢
    肥东店埠公社建立细收细打责任制度
    郫县算三笔账动员群众做到颗粒归仓
    本报合肥28日电　安徽肥东县店埠人民公社发动群众总结经验，建立细收细打责任制度，保证夏收的质量。店埠公社二万七千二百多亩麦子，大部分接近成熟，有的已开始收割。为了保证丰产丰收，公社党委组织社员对细收细打问题进行了讨论。各生产队在讨论中都总结了过去夏收的经验教训。如杨岗生产小队去年种的三十九亩“三月黄”小麦由于收割不及时，有十三亩受了风灾，每亩少收二十多斤；新夏小队有六亩麦秸没有打净，以后又复打了七十多斤麦子。通过讨论，大家都认为：过去麦子收打不净，主要原因之一就是没有建立严格的责任制度。公社根据社员们讨论的意见，及时订出了夏收“四定”责任制度。一，定田亩。各生产队根据劳力强弱和技术特长，十人左右组织一个临时抢收专业组，按照麦子好坏、田块远近，进行合理搭配，具体分到小组负责。二，定时间。根据小麦成熟早迟，分别规定收完的日期，先收“三月黄”，再收“南大二四一九”，保证做到熟一块收一块。三，定质量。做到不丢穗头，不掉麦粒，麦把要割齐，并采取插牌到田、点交到组的办法，以便于检查验收；同时，要做到当天收割当天验收，不符合细收细打的，仍由承包小组复收复打干净。四，定工分报酬。按照麦子好坏，订出收、运、打的工分。
    “四定”责任制在各生产队推行以后，普遍反映说：从去年忙到现在，吃辛受苦，一粒麦子也不能丢掉。很多社员还订了细收细打的公约，保证做到：割麦不丢穗，捆把不脱粒，场里不抛撒，麦秸不裹穗，麦穗里不藏粒，及时晒干进仓，防止牲畜糟蹋和阴雨霉烂等损失。郭湾生产小队五十七户社员，根据自己负担的农活，订出了细收细打的公约，在收割中推广了少揽快割的经验，收割后又组织二十多个儿童拾麦穗，做到颗粒不丢。中心大队开始收打麦子时，还有些粗糙，经过检查，发动社员进行了复打，每亩多打了三斤多。社员们算了一笔账：全大队三千多亩麦子，如果都收打粗糙，就要少收九千多斤。大家表示：以后收打时一点也不能粗心大意。目前，全社已收打的二千八百多亩麦子，经过检查验收，一般都达到了“四净”（割净、运净、打净、收净）的要求。
    本报成都28日电　四川郫县农民在夏收中采取算三笔账的办法，动员群众进一步细收细打。
    郫县抢收夏粮和油菜的工作正在紧张进行。由于一开始就强调要精打细收，抛撒浪费现象较已往有了减少，但是，经过深入检查，个别生产队抛撒现象还十分惊人。5月19日，社员阎秀峰（下放在这里的中共四川省委书记处书记）同县的检查团一道，在崇兴公社第一管理区第二生产队，重打、重筛了一部分已经打过、筛过的油菜“空秆”和“空荚”，结果在每亩地的“空秆”、“空荚”中，重新收打了三十四斤菜籽，再加从田里、田边扫来拣来的菜籽，每亩地平均抛撒四十来斤，这些油菜还是晴天收打的，可见阴天收打的抛撒就会更多。
  根据这个情况，当时大家算了三笔账：每亩如果以抛撒四十斤计算，全县十万零二千亩油菜，可多收菜籽四百零八万斤，每斤菜籽以一角七分计算，值六十九万多元，全县按人口平均，每人可得二元六角四分；四百零八万斤菜籽，每百斤出油四十斤，共出油一百六十多万斤，全县每人平均多收五斤十一两油；四百零八万斤菜籽榨油后可提供副产品——麻饼二百五十七万多斤，每亩田施用三十斤，可肥田八万五千多亩。有的社员说：“这样一算才看出，浪费实在严重呵！”各社参加检查团的干部也认为这是一件大事，纷纷打电话嘱咐家里的人，要坚决做到精打细收。
    中共郫县县委根据这次检查，立即作出几项规定，紧急指示各地进一步杜绝抛撒浪费。这几项规定是：各级党组织书记、管理区主任、生产队长和所有工作干部都必须亲自翻打一两处菜田，作出榜样、召开现场会议、当众算三笔账；未经重新翻打的秆、壳不准当作肥料下田和用作烧柴，当前如来不及翻打，要好好保管以便抽空再打；普遍建立铺有晒垫的脱粒场，打完后把地下的落粒扫净；收打小麦、绿肥以及其它夏熟作物时，也全部采用这一切做法；在重新翻打作物时，要深入地做好思想工作。
