Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to a New Delhi dispatch from the Indian Information Service: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech on May 8th in the People's House during a discussion on the Tibet question. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Mr. Deputy Speaker, in the past few weeks, this issue regarding the developments in Tibet has been raised several times in this House as well as in the Council of States, and I have had the opportunity to speak many times on the situation created by these developments. I believe, currently, enough has been said about the basic facts. Statements from China have disputed these facts as they are known to everyone. We do not consider some of the statements from China concerning India to be factual either. I sometimes doubt whether continuing this debate will be of any use; doing so would practically only mean repeating what has already been said. However, it might be a good thing for us to conduct this short discussion here. But in this discussion, many basic facts have been disputed, or basic concepts have been disputed, and thus it raises issues far broader than what is happening in Tibet.

The member of parliament who spoke passionately just before me (referring to Bharatiya Jana Sangh member Vajpayee) said many things that dispute all the basic assumptions of our policy; this policy has been accepted very consistently by this House—I think, also by the entire nation. Despite this, he disputed all these basic assumptions. Either he has never believed in these basic assumptions, or the events in Tibet have changed his opinion.

I do not intend to discuss all the basic assumptions of our policy in these few minutes. What I want to say now is that I do not agree with what that member of parliament said. I disagree with many things he said; as far as the government is concerned, we will not pursue the kind of policy he advocates we should pursue. I want to make this very clear.

I can mention in passing that we have not imposed any restrictions on the Dalai Lama, only the restrictions of conscience and etiquette judged by him personally. But, this member of parliament actually suggested that we let him do something he himself has not proposed, that is, to make India a base for some kind of propaganda campaign; actually suggested that we let this member of parliament and his party participate in this propaganda campaign, to say such words seems so strange, so astonishing, I cannot even imagine how he could have made such a suggestion if he had considered it beforehand. I don't need to say much about this, because it has no connection with what is currently happening in the world or in India or in Tibet or in China or anywhere.

He also emphasized the 1954 agreement—the agreement with China regarding Tibet. He said that we should not have signed this agreement at all. I also don't quite understand what these words or this viewpoint mean. What he actually expected us to do is unclear, other than perhaps holding a public gathering in Ramlila Maidan and delivering speeches. A country's foreign policy being executed by public gatherings held throughout India is not the way to do things. Undoubtedly, public gatherings are important. But we must face not only basic policies and assumptions, but also affirmative facts about foreign policy.

I have no doubt in my mind that the agreement we signed with China regarding Tibet was an appropriate agreement. It was a correct agreement, and we will abide by it. It is also incorrect for him to say that this agreement has been breached. It could be said that he believes that some of the implications of that agreement, in his view or in anyone else's view, have not been implemented. That is another matter. But, there is no question that that agreement has been breached. It continues to exist; it is still in effect.

I don't know how many people here understand the historical background of all these issues. We are naturally moved by emotion, we have had some emotional surges due to recent events, and it is completely understandable for this to happen, because of a certain close emotional connection and other connections—things that are mixed together—with Tibet, with the Tibetan people, or with the mountains of Tibet, or with Mount Kailash, or with Lake Manasarovar (the above two places, Kangrinboqe and Mapam Yumtso, are the places mentioned in the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India, where Indian pilgrims customarily travel to worship in the Tibet Region of China—editor's note), etc. We can understand this. We can respect this emotional response. Nevertheless, any policies that we determine or attempt to determine cannot be based on a surge of emotion. They must have some relation to the facts.

I don't know how many members of parliament here know the historical background of Tibet, China, Mongolia, Bhutan, and Sikkim and Nepal over the past few hundred years. I don't know how many have been willing to study them. I don't know if the member of parliament who just spoke has any understanding of it at all. I happen to have some understanding of it, and I have taken the trouble to read many books and histories, Chinese dynastic chronicles, and Indian reports, etc. Below is the history of the past six or seven hundred years or more, which begins with Genghis Khan's invasion of Tibet, and from Kublai Khan's special possession of Tibet (he considered the Dalai Lama at the time to be a spiritual master).

This is a strange combination. Politically, Kublai Khan ruled Tibet, but he considered the Dalai Lama his spiritual leader, so you see a strange combination emerge. In fact, for a considerable period, the relationship between Tibet and China was very strange, because—I believe I am correct in saying this—the Chinese have been quite contemptuous of Tibetans since the Mongol era. The Chinese were quite contemptuous of all countries outside their own. For a long time, whether it was the Tang Dynasty, or the Ming Dynasty, or finally the Qing Dynasty, they considered themselves to be China, the people of the Celestial Empire, a great power. For a long time, the relationship between China and Tibet frequently changed, sometimes sovereignty, sometimes suzerainty, sometimes semi-sovereignty, sometimes semi-independence, one after another, until the Qing Dynasty exercised complete control over Tibet in the early twentieth century, quite a substantial control. Even at the end of the Qing Dynasty, when it collapsed, it still had considerable influence in Tibet.

When the Manchu Dynasty collapsed about forty or fifty years ago, it weakened. Although it weakened, whoever was in power in China, whether it was the emperor or President Yuan Shikai, whether it was the warlords after them, or Marshal Chiang Kai-shek's regime, or the People's Government, from the emperors to the communists, their policy was consistent, that is, they considered themselves to be the rulers of Tibet. Undoubtedly, when Tibet was strong, it resisted this from time to time. There were times, at least twice, when Tibetan troops reached the Chinese capital, just as Chinese troops repeatedly entered Tibet—this is quite ancient. History also has had times when Nepalese troops entered Tibet, and Tibetan troops also entered Nepal. At least once, a certain general from Kashmir, Zorawar Singh, crossed the Tibetan Himalayas and conducted a glorious campaign, of course, he encountered an enemy more powerful than the Tibetans or anyone—the cold climate of Tibet. The low temperatures of Tibet caused him and his army to perish there. All this is history, chaotic history. Undoubtedly, the countries most closely related to Tibet in the past were Mongolia and China, due to historical and other reasons, religious reasons, cultural reasons, this is very natural.

But all these do not count. In considering the current situation, we must view them in terms of how things are at present and in the recent past. We cannot think of the era of Genghis Khan, or the era of Kublai Khan, or the Manchu emperors, or Chiang Kai-shek, or anyone else. Regarding the current situation, what exactly are we pursuing? If we accept the words of Member of Parliament Vajpayee, we should be more or less prepared for armed conflict on this issue. We cannot pat someone on the back, tell them to fight, and say we will cheer you on from behind. That is a ridiculous situation. We must be clear in our thinking about what we are saying or what we want to achieve. I believe, no matter what issues may arise, our purpose first and foremost is to resolve these issues peacefully. Bellicose rhetoric and bellicose actions will not promote a peaceful resolution. It is very clear that if some people in China think that they can intimidate India through threats and strong rhetoric, they are wrong. It is equally clear that if some people in India think that they can intimidate China through threats and bellicose rhetoric, this is equally wrong. Obviously, this is not the case, great powers—India or China—will not be manipulated in this way, they will react in the opposite way.

As far as China is concerned—not to us, but to other countries we are familiar with, to the United States and other countries—China itself is part of a system of military blocs, China itself is closely related to the Cold War. This is not said to us; but it is due to this bloc system. They have become accustomed to a way of expressing their opinions which I personally believe is incorrect in international discourse.

As for the tactics of the Cold War, we in India have had some recent experience of them. We have certainly reacted to them. We don't like it. Here a question arises: should we adopt that tactic. This is an important thing. Because it also relates to our policy. I believe, neither that policy nor that method of expression which can be called Cold War expression is right for any country: it is certainly not right for us, unless we want to completely change our policy. We don't want to change our policy. We believe that changing this policy would be harmful from any point of view. We should adhere to that policy. That policy is mainly based not on what other countries have done, but on the correctness of the policy itself as we understand it. We may lose control of ourselves from time to time. That is another matter. We are human. But, if we consider it with a cool head, we will certainly realize that we must adhere to that policy. If so, then we should not do those things if the opinions we express, our challenges, and our threats, etc., do not conform to such a policy.

I want to suggest to this House that this is not a sign of weakness. I think: no country in the world thinks that India has adopted a weak policy in the past few years. Some accuse us of bending over backwards, accusing us of favoring this side or that side. I think they have begun to realize that if we sometimes speak in a mild and friendly way, it does not indicate weakness, but rather a positive belief that this is the only correct way to handle international problems or, for that matter, domestic problems. Therefore, I think we must never talk about these bellicose practices or threats. We must never be dominated by anger, although we may sometimes feel a bit angry about what is happening. We must show with our firm policy and calm attitude that we will continue the kind of friendly efforts we have always made, even if things come to our borders.

There is undoubtedly great sympathy for the Tibetan people. This is certainly not because the Tibetan people have a feudal regime. They have been isolated from the outside world, they have had a static social system that may have existed in other parts of the world hundreds of years ago, but no longer exists elsewhere. No one here wants to maintain this system. In fact, I am quite sure that even the Dalai Lama does not want to maintain it in Tibet. Here, we see a strange thing, a society that has been completely isolated for hundreds of years suddenly appears before people, events push it into our crazy world, the Cold War and all sorts of things appear, active policies, terrible policies and arbitrary policies appear. Imagine the contrast between these two. It is a gulf. The painful consequences that arise from this kind of thing are inevitable. You can reduce these consequences. You can try to mitigate the impact of this shock. But you cannot make it disappear with a flick of the wrist. I believe that the past policy of the Chinese People's Government was to slowly implement so-called reforms or whatever measures, this government understands that a country like this cannot be treated with sudden measures. I cannot say whether that policy has changed. Maybe it has changed a little. That is very possible. I cannot say whether other changes are happening in China. This is certainly a policy, they have said publicly and privately that they recognize this.

I or we also have a difficulty in dealing with these issues, the words we use have different meanings for others, for example, we talk about Tibetan autonomy. The Chinese also talk about Tibetan autonomy. But I not only doubt, I think whether it contains the same meaning as they think it contains. I don't think so. There are so many other words. I am not talking about any intentional distortion. Putting that aside. Putting aside any distortion, ways of thinking have changed. Anyway, they have changed, and Cold War methods have changed them even more. Indeed, it is very difficult to speak the same language—I mean the language of the heart. It is also because of that point that difficulties arise and great misunderstandings arise. However, I cannot talk about all these issues.

I can talk about one thing. I think Dange mentioned something about a meeting on Tibet convened by a man named Majumdar. I had not heard of it until today, except today. In fact, I only heard about it when I was coming here. As far as all the documents I have seen—I did see them—I think, whatever that meeting seemed to want to achieve, or whatever it seemed to want to express, it seems to be very wrong, it is a wrong approach, this approach will not benefit anyone at all, and may cause great harm, if this is indeed an approach taken by any responsible person in India. Because we must first recognize one thing. What exactly do we want? What is our purpose? How can we achieve it? What can we do about it?

I think we feel distressed and sad about the events in Tibet. Why are we sad? Probably because we feel that some people are being attacked, being oppressed: whether some people are feudal landlords or that kind of people as Dange said, or whether they are the ordinary people of Tibet as others said, or whatever these people are, there are always some people anyway. I have no doubt in my mind that, in this situation, it is difficult to draw a line between the upper feudal elements and others. They may all be mixed together. As a result, they are all being eliminated at present. If a society has existed for thousands of years—it may no longer be useful, but the fact is—to eliminate it is an extremely painful process. It can be eliminated slowly, it can even be changed quickly but with a certain degree of cooperation. But, if any kind of forced elimination approach is taken to that kind of society, it will definitely be painful, whether it is a good society or a bad society. When we need to deal with some societies in the world that can be called primitive in terms of social organization, it is not an easy thing how to deal with them. All these difficult things are happening. They should have happened in a way that was possibly a little slower but with a greater degree of cooperation, they would have happened that way, because this change is only effective when it is carried out by the people themselves, and can minimize the harm to the social structure and the people concerned—others can help them, others can offer them advice, but the change must be carried out by themselves. Once good things are done in a bad way, good things become bad things. It produces different reactions. That is to say, I cannot judge what is happening in Tibet. I don't have the facts, and no one in this House has the facts, only generally here and there are some sporadic facts. But, I just want to presume to say that all these complicated practices—not easy to understand; whatever it may be anyway—have undoubtedly brought great pain to the Tibetan people. I had hoped to avoid it. But what can I do?

People strangely talk about convening representatives of some countries and issuing orders to do this and that. I am surprised that they think this way, as if it were achievable.

After some years of effort, the so-called summit will now—I believe—be held somewhere in Europe, the major powers of the earth, Russia and the United States and Britain and France and possibly some other countries—Italy—or whatever countries may be gathered there to decide the fate of the world. This has taken many years. I don't know what decisions they will make. I wish them success. I wish them to reach some kind of understanding. But, here some members of parliament casually say that we should issue orders and decrees, gather together to make decisions, otherwise it will be even more unfavorable to you, this approach seems simply like performing a farce, it has nothing to do with reality.

The basic fact is that China is a great power, India is a great power—great in terms of area, great in terms of historical background, great in many things. I am mainly not talking about military strength, although from the point of view of defense or offense, undoubtedly, their potential or strength is quite great.

From any long-term perspective on this issue, or even from a short-term perspective, it is quite important for China and India to be friends and cooperate with each other. This does not mean that they should take the same path, but they should not hinder each other, they should not be hostile to each other. This is unfavorable to India, to China. In fact, China may now be a very powerful country and is becoming more and more powerful. But, even from China's point of view, it is not a good thing to have an India that adopts a hostile attitude. If that kind of thing happens, the situation will be very different—I am not talking about the military aspect, but other aspects. It is in the interest of both countries that the two countries are not hostile to each other, even if they act in different and multiple ways. If China tells me what to do, I would probably be annoyed. If I tell China what to do, China would probably be even more annoyed than I am, because I am considered a mild person, while the Chinese are considered not very mild on these issues. That may be the case.

Now, maintaining our dignity, maintaining our rights, maintaining our self-respect, but not letting ourselves drift into taking the wrong attitude and hostile attitude, and trying to help eliminate or resolve the problems that arise, we may be of a little help to things—these problems cannot be solved quickly—this is the most that people can do in the current situation, anyway, creating an atmosphere that may help do this. I don't know how much effect this will have.

Therefore, I presume to say that this should be our general attitude on this issue. We cannot go any further. Maybe we can help things by taking this approach.

After all, this House and our country have expressed their reactions to the developments in Tibet, to the events in Tibet, in quite strong language. No one doubts them. But I can say that speaking in harsh and hostile language will not be persuasive, in fact, it will only create a greater divide and reduce the possibility of providing any help in reaching an understanding or seeking a solution.

Therefore, I want to suggest that we should not let ourselves lose control on these issues. One thing mentioned by two or three members of parliament is the issue of maps. Undoubtedly, those so-called old Chinese maps that still mark a considerable piece of Indian territory as if it belonged to China continue to exist, this situation has always been a factor that often annoys the people of our country. This has not caused any crisis, however, it is naturally difficult for the people of our country to understand why this kind of thing continues indefinitely year after year. Please note that the problem is not that some places have some small pieces of land that cause disputes, on which disputes we can have discussions, and there are two or three pieces of land we have already discussed, and will discuss—but the practice of issuing these maps that do not conform to the facts, these maps that are not true in fact, and are difficult to consider justified based on the history of Marshal Chiang Kai-shek's regime or any previous regime.

I just want to say one more sentence, I think, Dange talked about the Dalai Lama's palace, etc. I think this is an exaggeration. First of all, this was not his choice, this was our choice. It is slightly larger than the usual house in Mussoorie. We had to find the largest house, because there are many people involved. As I have already said, apart from security reasons, there is no surveillance of him at all, we have not prevented him from meeting anyone, if he wants to meet. In fact, without a large number of people, some people go to worship him, some—often Buddhist representatives from Ceylon and other places come to see him, they all go there. No one stops anyone. Of course, as for the strange journalists, especially foreign journalists who come here seeking sensational news, it is them that we also do not stop, but we do not welcome them, because this kind of person makes everything extremely sensational.

A few days ago, I said in another place that I do not like all these god-king, etc., terms. He is the Dalai Lama, people call him the Dalai Lama, if anyone always calls him the god-king to create sensationalism, I can say that the Dalai Lama himself does not like this kind of thing.

Therefore, we do not want this whole thing to be brought to or maintained at a sensational level. Precisely because of this, we do not want so many journalists to go there and implore him, if they go, there will always be difficulties, interpreter problems, etc., and there will be confusion, contradictions, etc.

Acharya Kripalani: You can allow some communist friends to see him.

Nehru: We will allow our communist friends and our People's Socialist Party friends, both. In fact, this is not a question of us allowing, we do not issue licenses. This is up to him to decide.

Acharya Kripalani: You can give them some extra convenience.

Nehru: Now we must face this bigger problem of these refugees. This is a difficult problem, it is imposed on us.

Can I say one more word on that issue, before March 11—that is, not long ago, about seven weeks ago, right?—we had no idea what might happen in Tibet. On March 11, the first news we received was about Tibetans holding some demonstrations in Lhasa, on the 17th, six days later; this thing about bombing the Dalai Lama's palace—it is said to be like this—happened. Dange talked about a little inaccurate shooting. I am only saying what others have said. It was not that it was not aimed accurately, but that it was deliberately bombarded there as a warning. Anyway, the situation at the time was developing, and by the 20th, fighting had broken out there. After that, the situation developed rapidly, and this House knows what happened later. The Dalai Lama left there on the evening of the 17th and arrived here at the end of the month, so various things did keep us very busy. We did not know he was coming here until about two days before the Dalai Lama actually entered India. When we knew he was going south, we assumed he might come, but only two days before that, we heard that he wanted to come here, so various things kept us very busy.

We decided to receive him; later, when others came, we decided to let them in too, so many refugees came in addition to the Dalai Lama. The current estimate is about 10,000—there are all kinds of refugees here, some are old, some are young, some are women; this will obviously become a small problem for us. We will not keep them in wire-fenced enclosures forever; currently we are placing them in two or three camps.

Mishra asked: Do all of them have food and shelter?

Nehru replied: However, the sooner we disperse them, the better. Maybe some people will want to stay for a while, I don't know.

Chowdhury asked: I have a question to ask, just a small question. One thing that has aroused great interest in many observers is that the Dalai Lama was elected as one of the Vice Chairmen of the National People's Congress of China.

A member of parliament said: It is the Panchen Lama.

Chowdhury said: Both the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama were elected. I am very sure of the facts I am talking about. That is the case.

Since he is also part of that country, has the government of our country received a request from the Chinese Embassy here to allow the Chinese Ambassador or any of his representatives to meet the Vice Chairman of the People's Republic?

Nehru: No, sir. We have not received such a request. You may remember that I said the Chinese Ambassador is welcome to meet him, if he wishes to meet.

Nayar: I want to ask the Prime Minister, are the 10,000 refugees who came here all wealthy feudal nobles, or are they ordinary people of Tibet.

Nehru: I cannot give any explanation for all of them. They have not arrived yet, they are on their way. But there probably would not be 10,000 nobles in Tibet.

　　答复关于西藏问题的讨论
    尼赫鲁五月八日在印度人民院发表讲话
    新华社9日讯　据印度新闻处新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁5月8日在人民院讨论西藏问题时，发表了讲话。讲话全文如下：
    副议长先生，在过去几星期中，在本院以及联邦院已经数次提出这个关于西藏事态发展的问题，我已经有机会就这种事态发展造成的局势发表了多次讲话。我觉得，目前对于基本事实谈得已经够了。来自中国的言论对于大家所知道的这些事实提出了异议。我们对于来自中国的言论中的一些有关印度的言论，也不认为是事实。我有时怀疑，我们继续进行这种争论会不会有甚么用处，这样做实际上只能意味着重复已经说过的话。然而，我们在这里进行这次短时间的讨论也许是一件好事。但是在这次讨论中，对于许多基本事实提出了异议，或者对于基本观念提出了异议，因而它提出了比西藏发生的事情要广泛得多的问题。
    就在我之前作了热烈发言的那位议员先生（指印度人民同盟议员瓦吉帕伊），说了许多对我们政策的一切基本假定提出异议的话；这种政策是为本院——我想还为整个国家——非常一致地接受的。尽管如此，他对所有这些基本假定提出了异议。要就是他从未相信过这些基本假定，要就是西藏发生的事情使他改变了意见。
    我不打算在这几分钟里讨论我们的政策的所有的基本假定。现在我想说的只是，我不赞同那位议员先生所说的话。我不同意他所说的许多东西；就政府而言，我们不会奉行他主张我们应该奉行的那种政策。我希望十分清楚地说明这一点。
    我可以顺便说一下，我们没有对达赖喇嘛实行任何限制，有的只是由他本人来判断的良知和礼仪的限制。但是，这位议员先生竟建议我们让他去做他自己并没有提出过的某种事情，那就是，使印度成为某种宣传运动的大本营；竟建议我们让这位议员先生和他的政党参加这一宣传运动，讲出这种话来似乎是如此奇怪，如此惊人，我甚至不能想像，如果他事先考虑过的话，他怎么可能会提出这样的建议。对于这一点我用不着多说，因为这同目前在世界上或者在印度或者在西藏或者在中国或是任何地方正在发生的事情是没有任何关系的。
    他还强调了1954年的协定——同中国缔结的关于西藏的协定。他说，我们根本不该签订这项协定。我也不太了解这种话或这种观点是什么意思。他究竟期望我们怎么做是不清楚的，除了也许是在拉姆利拉广场举行公众的集会并发表演说以外。一个国家的外交政策由在印度各地举行的公众的集会来执行，这不是办法。无疑，公众的集会是重要的。但是我们必须面对的不仅有基本政策和假定，而且有关于外交政策的肯定的事实。
    我心中毫不怀疑，我们同中国签订的关于西藏的协定是一个适当的协定。这是一个正确的协定，我们将遵守它。甚至他说这项协定已经被破坏，也是不正确的。可以说，他认为，那项协定的某些含义，在他看来或者在别的任何人看来没有得到贯彻。这是另一回事。但是，并不存在那项协定已经被破坏的问题。它继续存在；它仍然起作用。
    我不知道，这里有多少人了解所有这些问题的背景。我们很自然地动了感情，我们由于最近的事件而产生了一些感情的浪潮，发生这种情形是完全可以理解的，因为同西藏、同西藏人民的，或者是西藏的山岳，或者是开拉斯山，或者是马那萨罗瓦湖（以上两地即康仁波清和马法木错，是1954年签订的中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中提到的印度香客按惯例前往中国西藏地方朝拜的地点——编者注）等等有着某种亲密的感情上的联系和其他的联系——这是混杂在一起的东西。我们能够理解这一点。我们可以尊重这种感情上的反应。尽管如此，我们确定或企图确定的任何政策是不能拿一种感情的浪潮作基础的。它们必须同事实有一些关系。
    我不知道这里有多少议员先生知道西藏、中国、蒙古、不丹和锡金以及尼泊尔在过去几百年中的历史背景。我不知道有多少人曾愿意研究它们。我不知道刚刚发言的那位议员先生究竟对它有没有什么了解。我恰好对它有所了解，我曾经不怕麻烦读了许多书籍和历史、中国的历代的编年史和印度的报告等等。下面是过去六七百年或者更长一段时间的历史，这段历史是从成吉思汗侵入西藏，是从忽必烈汗以一种特殊的方式占有西藏（他认为当时的达赖喇嘛是精神方面的法师）的时候开始的。
　　这是一种奇怪的结合。在政治上，忽必烈汗统治着西藏，但是他认为达赖喇嘛是他的精神领袖，这样，你们就看到出现了一种奇怪的结合。事实上，在相当长的时期内，西藏同中国的关系是非常奇怪的，因为——我相信我这样说是不错的——中国人从蒙古人时代起一直是相当蔑视西藏人的。中国人相当蔑视他们自己的国家以外的一切国家。长期以来，不管是在唐朝，还是明朝还是最后在满清，他们都自认为是中国，是天朝人，是大国。在长时期内，中国同西藏的关系经常变化，有时是主权，有时是宗主权，有时是半主权，有时是半独立，像这样一个接一个地一直到满清王朝到二十世纪初期对西藏进行了完全的控制，相当大的控制。甚至在清朝的末日当它垮台的时候，它仍然在西藏拥有相当大的影响。
    当满洲王朝在大约四五十年以前崩溃时，它削弱了。虽然它削弱了，可是不论是谁在中国执政，不论是皇帝还是袁世凯总统，不论是在他们之后的军阀，还是蒋介石元帅的政权，还是人民政府，从皇帝到共产党人，他们奉行的政策是一贯的，即认为他们自己是西藏的统治者。毫无疑问，在西藏强盛的时候，它不时对此进行抵抗。曾经有过一些时候，至少有两次，西藏军队曾经像中国军队一再进入西藏那样到达中国首都——这是相当古老的。历史也有过这样一些时候，即尼泊尔军队进入过西藏，而西藏军队也进入过尼泊尔。至少有一次，克什米尔的某一位将军佐腊伐尔·辛格越过西藏的喜马拉雅山进行了辉煌的战役，当然，他遇到的只是比西藏人或任何人更强大的敌人——西藏寒冷的气候。西藏的低温使他和他的军队在那里复没。所有这一切都是历史，都是混乱的历史。毫无疑问，过去同西藏关系最亲密的国家是蒙古和中国，由于历史的和其他的原因、宗教原因、文化原因，这是很自然的。
    但是所有这些都不算数。在考虑目前的局势时，我们必须按照事物在目前和在不久以前的情况来看待它们。我们不能想到成吉思汗时代，或者忽必烈汗时代，或者满洲皇帝，或者蒋介石，或者任何其他人。关于目前的局势，我们所追求的究竟是什么呢？如果我们接受议员瓦吉帕伊先生的说法，我们就应当或多或少对在这个问题上发生武装冲突有所准备。我们不能拍拍某人的背，要他去打，并且说我们将在背后为你喝采。这是一种荒唐可笑的情况。我们必须在我们 
  的思想上明确我们所说的话或所要达到的目的。我认为，不管可能发生什么问题，我们的目的首先是要和平解决这些问题。好战的言论和好战的做法是不会促成和平解决的。很明显，如果中国有些人认为，通过威胁和强硬的言论，他们就能吓倒印度，那是错误的。同样明显的是，如果印度有些人认为，通过威胁和好战的言论，他们就能吓倒中国，这同样是错误的。显然不是这样，大国——印度或者中国——是不会这样受人摆布的，它们会作出相反的反应。
    就中国来说——不是对我们，而是对我们所熟知的其他国家，对美国和其他国家——中国本身是一方面的军事集团体系的一部分，中国本身同冷战是密切相关的。这不是说对我们；而是说由于这个集团体系。他们已经习惯于我个人认为在国际的言谈中是不正确的表达自己意见的方式。
    至于谈到冷战的手法，对于印度来说，我们最近对这种手法已经有了一些体验。诚然，我们对它是作出了反应。我们不喜欢它。这里产生了一个问题：我们是否应该采取那种手法。这是一件重要的事情。因为它也关系到我们的政策。我认为，无论是那种政策还是可以称作冷战表达方法的那种表达方法，对任何国家来说都是不对的：肯定对我们来说是不对的，除非我们想完全改变我们的政策。我们不想改变我们的政策。我们认为，无论从什么观点来看，改变这一政策都会是有害的。我们应该遵循那一政策。那个政策主要并不是根据别的国家做了什么，而是根据我们所能理解的那种政策本身的正确性。我们可能不时地控制不住自己。那是另外一个问题。我们是人。可是，假如我们头脑冷静地考虑，我们一定会认识到，我们必须坚持那一政策。如果是这样，那么要是我们所表达的意见、我们的挑战和我们的威胁等等不符合那样一个政策，我们就不应该做那些事情。
    我要向本院提出，这并不是示弱。我想：世界上没有任何国家认为印度在过去几年中所采取的是一个软弱的政策。有些人指责我们向后弯，指责我们偏袒这一边或者那一边。我想他们已经开始认识到，如果说有时候我们讲起话来温和而友好，这并不表示软弱，而是表示一种肯定的信念，即这是处理国际问题或者就此而言处理国内问题的唯一正确的方式。因此，我认为我们决不能谈论这些好战的做法或威胁。我们决不能被愤怒支配，尽管有时候我们可能对于正在发生的事件感到有点生气。我们必须以我们坚定的政策和沉着的态度来表明，我们将继续进行我们一向所作的那种友好的努力，即令事情弄到我们的边境上来了。
    对于西藏人民无疑是有着巨大的同情的。这当然不是由于西藏人民有着封建政权。他们一直与外界隔绝，一直有着静止的社会制度，这种制度几百年前可能在世界上其他地方存在过，但是在别处已不再存在。这里没有人希望保持这种制度。事实上，我十分肯定，甚至达赖喇嘛也不希望在西藏保持它。这里，我们看到一件奇怪的事情，一个完全与世隔绝了好几百年的社会突然出现在人们面前，事件把它推到我们的疯狂的世界中来了，冷战和种种事情出现了，活跃的政策、可怕的政策和专断的政策出现了。想像一下这两者之间的对比吧。这是一个鸿沟。从这种事情中源源不断地产生痛苦的后果，这是不可避免的。你可以减少这种后果。你可以设法缓和这种冲击的影响。可是你根本不能转一下念头就使它消失。我相信中国人民政府过去的政策是慢慢地实行所谓的改革或者不管是什么措施，这个政府了解，像这样一个国家是不能用突然的办法来对待的。那个政策是否改变了，我说不上。也许它改变了一点。那是很可能的。在中国是否正在发生其他的变化，我说不上。这肯定是一种政策，他们公开和私下说过，他们认识到这一点。
    我或者我们在处理这些问题时还有一个困难，我们所使用的字眼对其他人来说有着不同的含义，例如，我们谈西藏自治。中国人也谈西藏自治。可是我不仅怀疑，我认为它包含的意思是否跟他们所认为它包含的意思相同。我认为不是这样。还有这么多的其他的字眼。我并不是在谈任何故意的歪曲。撇开那一点不谈。撇开任何歪曲不谈，思想方法改变了。不管怎么样，它们改变了，而冷战方法使它们改变得更多。的确，要讲同一的语言——我指的是内心的语言——是非常困难的。也正由于那一点，困难产生了，并且产生了很大的误会。然而，我无法谈到所有这一切问题。
    我可以谈一件事情。我想丹吉曾提到一个叫马朱达的人召开的关于西藏的什么会议的事。除了今天以外，我一直没有听到过它。事实上，正当我来的时候，我才听到关于它的一些情况。就我所看的一切文件而言——我的确看到它们——我想，不管那个会议看来是想达到什么目的，或者不管它看来要表示些什么，看来都是非常错误的，它是一种错误的作法，这种作法不会对任何人有丝毫好处，而可能造成很大损害，如果这的确是印度任何负责人士采取的作法的话。因为我们必须首先认识到一件事情。我们究竟要怎样呢？我们的目的是什么呢？我们怎么能实现它呢？我们对它能够做些什么呢。
    我认为，我们对西藏的事件感到忧愁，感到难过。我们为什么难过呢？大概是因为我们觉得有些人正在受到袭击，受到压迫：不管某些人是像丹吉所说的那样是一些封建地主或者那样一类的人，还是像其他人所说的那样是西藏的普通人民，或者不论这是些什么人，无论如何总是有那么一些人。我心里毫不怀疑，在这种情况下，要在上层封建分子和其他人之间划一条界线是困难的。他们全都可能混在一起。结果，目前他们全都被铲除了。如果一个社会已经存在了千百年——它可能已不再有用了，可是事实是——要铲除它是一个极其痛苦的过程。它可以慢慢地加以铲除，它甚至可以迅速地然而是在有一定程度的合作的情况下加以改变。但是，如果对那种社会采取任何一种强迫铲除的做法，那就必定会是痛苦的，无论它是好的社会还是坏的社会。当我们在世界上任何地方需要处理这样一些从社会组织来说可以叫作原始性质的社会的时候，该怎样加以处理不是一件容易的事情。所有这些困难的事情正在发生。它们本来是应当在可能稍微慢一些然而得到较大程度的合作的情况下发生的，它们本来是会这样发生的，因为这种改变只有在有关人民自己进行的情况下才是有效的，才能使社会结构和有关的人受害最小——别人可以帮助他们，别人可以向他们提出建议，但是要由他们自己进行改变。一旦用坏方法来办好事，好事就变成坏事。它产生不同的反应。那就是说，我不能判断正在西藏发生的事情。我没有掌握事实，本院的任何人也没有掌握事实，只是一般地在这里和那里有某个零星的事实。但是，我只是要不揣冒昧地说，所有这些复杂的做法——不是容易弄清楚的；无论如何，不管它可能是什么——无疑为西藏人民带来了很大的痛苦。我本来是希望避免它的。可是我有什么办法呢？
    人们奇怪地谈到召集一些国家的代表和发出做这种事情做那种事情的命令。我很惊奇，他们竟这样想，好像这是办得到的一样。
    经过一些年的努力以后，现在将要——我相信——在欧洲某地举行所谓最高级会议了，地球上的各大国、俄国和美国和英国和法国而且可能还有别的什么国家——意大利——或者不管可能是什么国家被召集到那里去决定世界的命运。这花了好多年的时间。它们会作出什么决定，我是不知道的。我祝它们成功。我祝它们达成某种谅解。但是，这里有些议员先生随便地说，我们应当发布命令和法令，聚在一起作出决定，不然的话将对你们更加不利，这种作法似乎简直是演滑稽歌剧的作法，它同现实毫无关系。
    基本的事实是，中国是大国，印度是大国——在幅员方面是大国，在历史背景方面是大国，在许多事情上是大国。我说的主要不是军事力量方面，虽然从防御或进攻的观点来看，无疑的，他们的潜力或实力是相当大的。
    从任何长远角度来看这个问题，或者哪怕是从短期的角度来看这个问题，中国和印度做朋友，互相合作，是相当重要的事情。这并不是说，它们应该走同一条道路，可是它们彼此不应该妨碍，它们彼此不应该敌视。这对于印度，对于中国都是不利的。事实上，中国现在可能是一个非常强盛的国家，并且正在变得愈来愈强盛。可是，即使从中国观点来看，有一个采取敌对态度的印度也不是一件好事情。如果发生那样的事情，情况会大大不同——我不是在谈军事方面，而是其他方面。这两个国家彼此不敌视，这是符合两国的利益的，即使它们以不同的和多种的方式行事。如果中国对我说该怎么做，我大概会恼火。如果我对中国说该怎么做，中国大概甚至比我还要恼火，因为我被认为是一个温和的人，而中国人被认为在这些问题上不是非常温和的。事情可能就是这样。
    现在，保持我们的尊严，保持我们的权利，保持我们的自尊，然而却不让自己随波逐流地采取错误态度和敌对态度，并设法帮助消除或解决发生的问题，我们这样做，可能对事情有一点帮助——这些问题不可能很快得到解决——这就是人们在当前情况下能够做的最大限度，无论如何，创造一种可能帮助这样做的气氛。这会有多大作用，我不知道。
    因此，我不揣冒昧地说，这应该是我们在这个问题上的总的态度。我们不能再前进了。我们采取这种办法也许对事情有帮助。
    毕竟，本院和我国已经以相当有力的语言表达了他们对西藏的局势发展，对西藏的事件的反应。没有谁怀疑它们。但是我可以说，用激烈和敌对的语言讲话不会具有说服力，事实上，它只会造成更大的鸿沟，而减少在达成谅解或在寻求解决办法方面提供任何帮助的可能性。
    因此，我想建议，我们不应该让自己在这些问题上失去自制。有两三位议员提到的一件事情是地图的问题。毫无疑问，肯定把相当大的一片印度领土标得好像是属于中国的那些所谓旧中国地图还继续存在，这种情况，一直是使我国人民经常感到恼怒的一个因素。这并不是引起了什么危机，然而，我国人民自然很难理解，为什么这种事情无限期地年复一年地继续下去。请注意，问题不是某些地方有某块零碎的土地引起争执，在这种争执上我们是可以进行讨论的，而且有两三块土地我们已经进行过讨论，并且将要进行讨论——而是发行这些不符合事实的地图的做法，这些地图在事实上不真实的、很难根据蒋介石元帅的政权或者以前任何政权的历史认为它们是正当的。
    我只想再说一句话，我想，丹吉谈到达赖喇嘛的宫殿等等的事。我认为这是言过其实。首先，这不是他选择的，这是我们选择的。它比穆索里通常的房子稍大一些。我们不得不找最大的房子，因为有关的人是很多的。　　像我已经说过的，除了保安原因外，根本没有什么监视他的事情，我们并没有阻止他会见任何人，如果他想会见的话。事实上，没有大量的人，有些人是去参拜他，有些人——往往是锡兰和其他地方的佛教代表前来见他，他们全都到那里去。没有谁阻止任何人。当然，至于奇怪的新闻记者，特别是来这里寻求耸人听闻的消息的外国记者，就是他们，我们也不阻止，但是我们不欢迎他们，因为这样的人把任何事情都弄得极其耸人听闻。
    前几天，我在另一个地方说过，所有这一切神王等等说法是我所不喜欢的。他是达赖喇嘛，人们称他达赖喇嘛，如果有谁老是称他为神王来制造耸人听闻的事情，我可以说，达赖喇嘛本人不喜欢这种事情。
    因此，我们不希望这整个事情被弄到或保持在耸人听闻的水平。正因为如此，我们根本不希望那么多的记者去那里恳求他，他们去，就总会发生困难，译员问题等等，于是就会发生混乱、矛盾等等。
    阿恰里亚·克里帕拉尼：你可以允许一些共产党朋友去见他。
    尼赫鲁：我们将允许我们的共产党朋友和我们的人民社会党朋友，两者都允许。实际上，这不是一个我们允许的问题，我们不发许可证。这要由他决定。
    阿恰里亚·克里帕拉尼：你可以给他们一些额外的便利。
    尼赫鲁：现在我们必须面对关于这些难民的这个更大的问题。这是一个困难问题，是强加在我们身上的。
    我是否可以就那个问题再讲一句话，在3月11日以前——就是说不久以前，大约是七星期以前，是吧？——我们对西藏可能发生的事情还毫无所知。在3月11日，我们得到的第一个消息是关于西藏人在拉萨举行某些示威的消息，在17日即六天以后；这件轰击达赖喇嘛宫殿的事情——据说是这样——发生了。丹吉谈到一点射击不准的事情。我所说的只是别人所说的。并不是瞄得不准，而是故意向那里轰击以作为一种警告。无论如何，当时的局势在发展，到20日，那里发生了战斗。在那以后，局势迅速发展，本院是知道以后发生的事情的。达赖喇嘛在17日傍晚离开那里，在月底到达这里，于是种种事情的确使我们忙得不可开交。直到达赖喇嘛实际进入印度的大约前两天，我们才知道他正在前来这里。当我们知道他在往南走的时候，我们曾设想他可能前来，但是只是在那以前两天，我们才听说他希望到这里来，于是种种事情使我们忙得不可开交。
    我们决定接待他；后来，在其他人来的时候，我们决定也让他们进来，于是除达赖喇嘛以外又来了这么许多难民。目前的估计是一万左右——这里面有各种各样的难民，有老年的，有的是青年，有的是妇女；这对我们来说显然是会成为一个小小的问题。我们不会永远把他们安置在用铁丝网围起的场子里；目前我们把他们安置在两三个营场里。
    米什拉问：他们所有的人都有吃的和住的地方了吗？
    尼赫鲁答：不过，我们愈早把他们分散开来愈好。也许有些人会要留一个时候，我不知道。
    乔杜里问：我有一个问题要问，只是一个小问题。有一件事情引起了许多观察家的很大的兴趣，那就是达赖喇嘛被中国的人民代表大会选举为副委员长之一。
    一位议员先生说：是班禅喇嘛。
    乔杜里说：班禅喇嘛和达赖喇嘛都当选了。我对我讲的事实很肯定。是这样的。
    既然他也是那个国家的一部分，我国政府有没有接到这里中国大使馆的要求，让中国大使或者他的任何代表来见见人民共和国的副委员长？
    尼赫鲁：没有，先生。我们没有接到这种要求。你也许记得，我说过欢迎中国大使来会见他，如果他希望会见的话。
    纳雅尔：我希望问一下总理先生，前来的这一万名难民都是富有的封建贵族呢，还是西藏的普通老百姓。
    尼赫鲁：我无法对他们所有的人作任何说明。他们还没有到达，他们正在途中。可是西藏大概不大会有一万名贵族。
