The Communist Party and the Tibetan people share deep affection, leading the Tibetan people to paradise. Housing has been built on the grasslands, realizing a settled nomadic life unprecedented in history. The communization is like the rising sun, dispelling the cold and bringing warmth and strength. We, generation after generation, will forever face this rising sun.
