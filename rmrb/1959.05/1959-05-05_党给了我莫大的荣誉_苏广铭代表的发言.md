Comrades Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully endorse all the reports of the conference and suggest that the conference approve them. I felt very excited after listening to the various reports of the conference. I am a milling machine operator from the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant. Before liberation, I worked for capitalists for eighteen years, living a life of displacement, hunger, and cold. Thanks to the Communist Party for liberating me and nurturing me, enabling me to contribute my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    In my childhood, I was forced by landlords because I could not pay the rent. Later, I followed my father to Harbin to escape the famine. At the age of twelve, I started as an apprentice in a factory. In the old society, people often said, "Apprentice, apprentice, three years as a slave," but in reality, I apprenticed for six years before becoming a full-fledged worker. Later, I worked at Thirty-Six Sheds (Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Plant). In those years, we workers suffered from the oppression of imperialism and capitalists, unable to get enough food or clothing. It was not until the liberation of Northeast China that the Communist Party saved us. The workers became masters of their own affairs, and the factory became an enterprise of the working class.
    After the liberation of Harbin, during the period of economic recovery, all the workers in our plant, under the leadership of the Communist Party, engaged in selfless labor, vigorously supporting the Liberation War. At that time, although I felt infinite warmth and love for the Party, my class consciousness was not high enough, and there were still many non-proletarian thoughts in my mind. I even had thoughts of breaking away from the ranks of the working class and starting my own factory as a "boss." This was a dangerous path. At that time, the Party promptly discovered this problem and gave me patient education, which quickly awakened me. As a glorious proletarian fighter, how could I only care about personal interests and ignore the interests of the broad masses? I deeply regretted my mistakes and resolved to work hard and live up to the Party's education.
    Thirty-year-old milling machine "rejuvenated"
    In the second half of 1955, a tremendous upsurge of socialist construction emerged throughout the country. All the workers in our plant were very excited and expressed their determination to complete their tasks with practical actions. On one occasion, our plant accepted the task of processing an important part for locomotives, the "rocking link." At that time, the factory's equipment was very simple, and only the milling machine I used could process this part. However, even with two shifts changed to three shifts, the task could not be completed. Some people suggested that to complete the task, it was necessary to add equipment. But I felt that the country had just begun construction, and where would we get the equipment? Seeing that the country's task could not be completed, I was very anxious, and my eyes were red. At that time, the Party called on us to find tricks and think of ways. With the help of the Party and comrades, I finally designed a tool that installed ten cutters on one tool holder. This shortened the processing time for one "rocking link" from three days to one day, and as a result, the task was overfulfilled. In the second half of 1955, the factory gave us a new task: to test corn milling cutters and use these cutters to process the "axle box support plate adjusting screw groove." Processing highly precise workpieces with new cutting tools requires precision machine tools and skilled techniques, but the milling machine I was using was an old, outdated milling machine with more than thirty years of history. At that time, I was still illiterate, and I felt that it was very difficult to complete this task. But I thought: the working class cannot bow to difficulties, and the task must be completed. After the factory Party committee organized us to attend classes and visit fraternal factories at the Industrial University, it was very enlightening for me. In order to speed up the milling machine's revolutions, I tried to improve the pulley and install a water pump, increasing the revolutions from 297 to 450. After the successful trial use of the corn milling cutter, I improved several parts, which not only "rejuvenated" the milling machine, but also increased efficiency by more than eight times. It could perform high-speed cutting, process workpieces with a precision of the second or third grade, and could also do the work of lathe operators, planers, and fitters. In this way, I successfully completed the task given to me by the leadership.
    Completed the First Five-Year Plan task one year and eleven months ahead of schedule
    In order to enable me to master theory and continuously improve my skills, the Party actively helped me to learn culture. In response to the Party's call, I joined the workers' spare-time literacy school. I was very happy to be able to go to school even though I had been illiterate for half my life. In a short period of one year, I learned more than 3,000 characters and got rid of my illiteracy. This enabled me to learn a lot of knowledge from newspapers and magazines. Then, in my work, I successively improved more than 40 kinds of tools, the highest of which increased productivity by 20 times, and improved eleven parts of an old milling machine, comprehensively increasing efficiency by more than one time. Due to the continuous tool reforms, the production tasks were guaranteed to be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. At that time, I didn't know how much work I had done. According to the factory's statistics, I had completed the task of the First Five-Year Plan one year and eleven months ahead of schedule on January 26, 1956. Thanks to the Party's education and help, my class consciousness continued to improve. In March 1956, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In the same year, I attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives and saw our great leader Chairman Mao. At that time, I felt a fire in my heart, and I couldn't help but think of the past old society when there was no food to eat, and one child even starved to death. And now? Not only do we have enough food and clothing, but also two children have gone to college. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao not only saved me, but also gave me tremendous honor. At that National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives, I also learned many valuable experiences. After returning to the factory from Beijing, I caught up with the factory accepting a batch of export processing tasks "rail gauge rod clamps." This is an essential tool used on railways to prevent train derailments. There is a groove in the middle, and the inside of the groove is a "curved bottom." Due to the limitations of the equipment, it was processed several times, but it was still rough. The Party entrusted this task to me again. At that time, I thought that these products were for export, and even though our equipment was not good, we must ensure the quality of the products and never lose face for the country. So, with the Party's continuous help and support, I began to figure out how to improve the tool. I used cemented carbide cutters to cut the cross-section of the workpiece, and improved the fixtures, made new molds, and used the high-speed cutting method taught by Soviet experts for cutting. But after the alloy cutter generated high heat, the blade fell off, so I thought of a way to install a circulating water pump to solve this problem. In order to achieve the plan of producing more than 2,800 pieces per month, I adopted the method of double-cutter operation, and finally completed the task with guaranteed quality, quantity and ahead of schedule.
    Leap forward to 1970 by the end of this year
    At the beginning of 1958, the provincial and municipal Party organizations established me as a model for the whole province. I felt that the Party had given me great glory, but I also felt ashamed, deeply feeling that I had done too little, and resolved to work harder. After I and my comrade-in-arms, Sun Maosong, an advanced lathe operator from the Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, launched a friendly competition, I constantly learned from him, taking the best from each other. Therefore, in 1958, I made 27 technical innovations. For example, in the production of boiler-towing machines to support agriculture, because the processing efficiency of the tow bar was low, I tried to research and adopt a rotary copying fixture, which increased efficiency by more than 20 times. Due to the continuous learning of advanced experience and continuous technical innovation, I completed the workload of the Second Five-Year Plan in March 1958 ahead of schedule. Now I am doing the work of December 1965.
    In order to dedicate myself to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, I want to achieve a greater leap forward on the basis of the leap forward in 1958, and strive to complete five years of work in one year this year. By the end of this year, I guarantee to leap forward to 1970.
    This year, I also manufactured an automatic copying vertical milling machine, which is more than five times more efficient than the original. This milling machine has been completed ahead of schedule before I came to Beijing for the meeting, as my gift to the "May 1st" festival. In addition, I will manufacture two more milling machines, which are expected to increase efficiency by more than ten times, as my gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. I also plan to put forward 60 rationalization proposals. In the manufacture of indigenous equipment, I will make full use of old waste materials, and adhere to the experience of utilizing old cutters for refurbishment. This will save the country 120 milling cutters throughout the year. At the same time, I will also realize the standardization of all commonly processed special accessories and the use of pneumatic fixtures. In terms of training apprentices, I guarantee that all the 14 apprentices in the group will be able to operate independently and be familiar with the structure of the machine tool before the National Day this year.
    With the development of production and the needs of industrial construction, our factory was changed from a repair factory to a manufacturing factory in the second half of 1958. All the workers in the factory accepted this arduous and glorious task of leaping forward with extremely excited moods. Of course, the task is very heavy. There are many difficulties, but no difficulties can stop us from moving forward. Now the Party is leading us to launch a vigorous technical revolution movement. If there are not enough raw materials, everyone will dig up scrap iron and steel; if there is not enough equipment, we will build it ourselves; if there is no large equipment, we will use the method of "ants gnawing at bones"; if the technology is not clear, we will hold a "Zhuge Liang" meeting and study it together; if there is not enough time, we will carry out a great competition of one day being equivalent to several days and one year being equivalent to several years; if there is not enough labor, we will make a big fuss about mechanization. In this way, our factory produced 505 new vehicles in the second half of 1958. And since then, it has ended the history of our factory only repairing vehicles and not producing vehicles for 60 years.
    For more than 30 years, I have watched the rise and fall of the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, and I breathe and share its fate. Now that it has grown and become a new type of factory in the motherland, and new vehicles are driving out of the factory gate, I have unspeakable joy. Our factory will produce 4,000 new vehicles this year. After discussion, all the staff and workers of the factory fully realized that locomotives and vehicles are important products of the country. Therefore, we must conscientiously implement the principle of the whole country playing a unified game of chess, try every possible means to overcome difficulties, and be determined to concentrate all our efforts and ensure the completion of the vehicle manufacturing task under the conditions of not increasing manpower, adding less equipment, relying on our own efforts, and tapping potential. At present, a vigorous red flag competition movement has been launched throughout the factory, and the tasks given to us by the state in the first quarter have been successfully completed. Before I came to Beijing for the meeting, all the staff and workers of the factory specially held a conference and repeatedly instructed me to tell the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao and the national people's representatives that we will definitely be able to overfulfill the leap forward plan for 1959. This is not only the voice of the staff and workers of our factory, but also the voice of the working class and the people of the whole country. I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, my country's 1959 national economic plan will definitely be fully and overfulfilled.
    Finally, I wish the conference a complete success!

### 党给了我莫大的荣誉  苏广铭代表的发言

专栏：

    党给了我莫大的荣誉
    苏广铭代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告，并建议大会予以批准。我听了大会的各项报告以后，感到很兴奋。我是哈尔滨车辆厂的一个铣工。在解放前，我给资本家干了十八年的活，过着流离失所、饥寒交迫的生活。多亏共产党解放了我，培养了我，使我能为祖国的社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
    我在幼年时，因为交不上租子，受地主逼迫。后来跟随父亲逃荒到哈尔滨。十二岁的时候，开始到工厂学徒。在旧社会里，人们常说：“学徒、学徒、三年为奴”，实际上我学了六年才满徒。以后，我到三十六棚（哈尔滨车辆修理厂）干活。在那些年月里，我们工人遭受着帝国主义和资本家的压迫，吃不上、穿不着。直到东北解放后，共产党才拯救了我们。工人当了家、做了主，工厂成为工人阶级自己的企业了。
    哈尔滨解放以后，在经济恢复时期，我们全厂的工人，在共产党的领导下，进行忘我的劳动，有力的支援了解放战争。那时，我虽然对党，感到无限的温暖和热爱，但是由于自己的阶级觉悟还不够高，脑子里还存在着不少非无产阶级思想。甚至曾经有过脱离工人阶级队伍、自己搞工厂当“老板”的思想活动。这是一条危险的道路。那时候，党及时地发现了这个问题，对我进行了耐心的教育，使我很快地觉醒了。做为光荣的无产阶级战士，怎能只顾个人利益而忽视广大群众的利益呢？深深痛悔自己的不对，决心埋头苦干，一定不辜负党对我的教育。
    三十多年的旧铣床“返老还童”
    一九五五年下半年，全国出现了翻天复地的社会主义建设高潮。我们全厂工人都很兴奋，都表示要以实际行动完成任务。有一次，我厂接受了加工机车上用的一个重要部件“摇连杆”的任务。当时，工厂的设备很简陋，全厂只有我使用的那台铣床能够加工这个部件。但是，当时虽然把两班改为三班生产，还是完不成任务。当时有的人就提出，要完成任务就必须增添设备。可是我感到国家刚刚开始进行建设，从那里去添置呢？眼瞅着国家的任务不能完成，心里非常着急，当时我把眼睛都熬红了。那时候，党号召我们找窍门、想办法，在党和同志们的帮助下，我终于设计出一种在一把刀杆上安装十个刀的工具。这样，使加工一个“摇连杆”的时间从三天缩短成一天，结果超额地完成了任务。一九五五年下半年，厂里又交给我们一个新的任务：试验玉米铣刀，并用这种刀具加工“轴箱托板调整螺丝槽”的工作物。用新刀具加工精密度很高的工作物，就要求有精密的机床和熟练的技术，而我使用的那个铣床，却是一台已经有三十多年历史的老掉了牙的旧铣床。我那时还是一个文盲，对于完成这项任务实在感到困难重重。但是我想：工人阶级不能向困难低头，任务一定要完成。经过工厂党委组织我们到工业大学去听课学习和参观兄弟厂，对我启发很大。为了把铣床加快转数，我设法改进了皮带轮和安装上水泵，把转数从二百九十七转，提高到四百五十转。试用玉米铣刀成功后，又改进了几个机件，不仅使铣床“返老还童”，而且还提高效率八倍多，它可以进行高速切削，能加工二、三级精度的工作物，还能干车工、刨工、钳工的活。就这样，我胜利地完成了领导上给予我的任务。
    提前一年十一个月完成第一个五年计划的任务
    党为了使我能够掌握理论，不断地提高技术，积极地帮助我进行文化学习。为了响应党的号召，我入了工人业余扫盲学校。半辈子的睁眼瞎子也能上学，我心中可高兴了。在短短的一年时间内，我就认识了三千多字，摘掉了文盲帽子。这样，使我从报纸和杂志上学到了许多知识，紧接着我在劳动中又陆续地改进了四十多种工具，其中最高的提高生产率达二十倍，并把一台老铣床改进了十一个部件，综合提高效率一倍以上。由于不断地进行工具改革，保证了生产任务的提前和超额完成。那时候，我究竟干了多少活，自己也不知道。经过工厂的统计，我在一九五六年一月二十六日，就已提前一年零十一个月完成了第一个五年计划的任务。由于党对我的教育和帮助，我的阶级觉悟不断地提高，我在一九五六年三月，光荣地参加了中国共产党。同年，又出席了全国先进生产者代表会议，看见了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。当时心里觉得热火火的，不由得，想起了过去旧社会时没有饭吃，并且还饿死了一个孩子。而现在呢？不仅丰衣足食，还有两个孩子都上了大学。共产党和毛主席不仅救了我，还给了我莫大的荣誉。在那次全国先进生产者代表会议上，我又学习了许多宝贵的经验。从北京回厂后，正赶上厂里接受一批出口的加工任务“轨距杆卡子”。这是铁路上防止列车出轨用的必备的工具，中间有一道槽，靠槽里边是个“弧形底”。由于设备的限制，加工了好几次，仍然是毛刺刺的。党又把这个任务交给了我。当时我想，这批产品是出口的，别看我们设备不好，但是一定要保证产品质量，决不能给国家丢脸。于是就在党不断地帮助和支持下，开始捉摸改进这个工具。我采用硬质合金刀来切削这个工作物的断面，并且改进卡具，做新胎型，用苏联专家教给的高速切削法进行切削，但合金刀发高热后，刀片就掉了，于是又想办法，安上了循环水泵解决了这个问题。为了实现月产二千八百多个的计划，我采用了双刀作业的方法，终于保质保量和提前完成了任务。
    今年年底要跃进到一九七○年
    一九五八年初，省、市党组织树立我为全省的标兵，自己感到党给了我很大的光荣，但又觉得惭愧，深感自己做的太少了，决心更加努力。当我和我的战友——哈尔滨市第一机械厂先进车工孙茂松开展友谊竞赛后，我就不断地向他学习，取长补短。因此，我在一九五八年内，又搞了二十七项技术革新，例如在为支援农业赶制锅驼机的生产中，因为拖轮加工效率低，就设法研究和采用了回转靠模卡具，结果提高效率二十多倍。由于不断地学习先进经验，不断地进行技术革新，所以我在一九五八年三月就提前完成了第二个五年计划的工作量。现在我正在做一九六五年十二月份的工作。
    为了向国庆节十周年献礼，我要在一九五八年跃进的基础上，实现更大的跃进，要力争在今年一年内，完成五年的工作量。到今年年底，我保证跃进到一九七○年。
    今年，我还制造了一台自动化靠模立式铣床，比原有的提高效率五倍以上。这台铣床，已在我来京开会前提前完成，做为我向“五一”节的献礼。另外我还要制造两台铣床，预计提高效率十倍以上，做为我向国庆十周年的献礼。还计划提出六十项合理化建议。在制造土设备中，将全部利用旧废材料，和坚持利用旧刀翻新的经验，这样作全年可给国家节省一百二十把铣刀。同时我还要使经常加工的专用配件，全部实现胎型化和风动卡具化。在带徒弟方面，我保证小组内现有的十四名徒工，在今年国庆节前，全部达到能够独立操作，和熟悉机床的构造的水平。
    随着生产的发展和工业建设的需要，在一九五八年下半年我厂由原来的修理厂改为制造厂。全厂工人以极其兴奋的心情接受了这个艰巨而光荣的跃进的任务。当然，任务是很重的。困难是很多的，可是什么困难也阻挡不了我们前进。现在党正在领导我们展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动。原材料不够，大家就动手挖废钢铁；设备不够用，就自己造，没有大设备，就用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法；技术上弄不通，就开“诸葛亮”会，大家一块研究；时间不够用，我们就进行一天顶几天、一年顶几年的大竞赛；劳动力不足，就大闹机械化。这样，我厂在一九五八年下半年就生产了五百零五辆新的车辆。并且从此结束了我厂六十年来只修理车，不生产车的历史。
    三十多年来，我看着哈尔滨车辆厂的兴衰，我和它同呼吸，共命运。现在，它已经发展壮大了，已经成为祖国一个新型的工厂，一辆辆崭新的车辆，开出了工厂的大门，使我有说不出的喜悦。我们工厂今年将生产四千台新车辆的任务，全厂职工经过讨论，充分认识到，机车车辆是国家的重要产品。因此，我们要认真贯彻全国一盘棋的方针，千方百计克服困难，决心在不增人力、少添设备、自力更生、挖掘潜力的条件下，集中一切力量，保证车辆制造任务的完成。目前，在全厂范围内已经掀起一个轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛运动，并且胜利的完成了第一季度国家给予的任务。这次我来京开会以前，全厂职工专门开了一次大会，再三嘱咐我说：告诉党中央、毛主席和全国人民代表，我们一定能够超额完成一九五九年的跃进计划。这不仅是我厂职工的呼声，而且是全国工人阶级和全国人民的呼声。我深信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我国一九五九年的国民经济计划一定能够全面地超额地完成。
    最后，预祝大会胜利成功！
