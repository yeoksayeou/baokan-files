Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: Guo Moruo's historical drama "Cai Wenji" began its public performance in the capital on the 21st.

The play begins with Cai Wenji's longing for her homeland. Cao Cao sends Han envoys Dong Si and Zhou Jin to redeem Wenji and bring her back to the country. However, Wenji's husband, the Left Wise King, refuses to allow her to take her children with her, and Wenji is caught in an internal conflict: "Happy to be returning alive to meet a wise ruler, but going back makes it difficult to fulfill both affections." After Dong Si's persuasion, Wenji resolutely leaves her husband and children and returns to Ye. However, Dong Si is sentenced to death by Cao Cao on the charge of "improper conduct, secretly communicating with the Xiongnu" due to Zhou Jin's suspicion and false report. Upon hearing the news, Wenji steps forward and pleads with Cao Cao based on the facts, recounting the truth of Dong Si's patriotism and loyalty to the emperor. Cao Cao pardons Dong Si. Several years later, Wenji's children come to the Han Dynasty with the Xiongnu King Shanyu, and mother and children are reunited. Through Cao Cao's mediation, Wenji marries Dong Si. Initially, Wenji was trapped among the Xiongnu and immersed in sorrow, but Dong Si saved her. Later, Wenji saved Dong Si from the death penalty, so Cao Cao praised them as a pair of "lovebirds in life and death." The play ends in an atmosphere of joy as family members reunite and the marriage is reaffirmed.

The Beijing People's Art Theatre has made many new attempts in the artistic presentation and treatment of this play. The play adopts the techniques of Sichuan Opera, using "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute" as a chorus to enrich the expressive power of the drama and help the actors to better portray the spiritual character of the roles. One scene is sung by the actress Zhu Lin. This is when Wenji is on her way back to the country, arriving at the outskirts of Chang'an one night. Wenji strokes the burnt-tail zither in front of her father Cai Yong's tomb and sings, "Now I bid farewell to my son and return to my homeland, old grievances are settled, but new grievances grow long, weeping blood and looking up to heaven, why was I born to suffer this calamity alone!" The sound of the zither is mournful and the singing voice is gentle and lingering. At the climax and important turning points of the play, national music is also used to enhance the atmosphere. The music was composed by Jin Ziguang and others, based on the ancient zither music of "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute." The chorus is sung by Li Shujun, a young actress specially invited from the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre.

During rehearsals, the playwright Guo Moruo gave reports to the actors. The actors carefully studied historical materials about Cao Cao and Cai Wenji, and insisted on practicing basic skills such as body movements and eye expressions every day.

### “蔡文姬”开始在首都公演

    “蔡文姬”开始在首都公演
    据新华社22日讯　郭沫若创作的历史话剧“蔡文姬”，21日起在首都公演。
    这出戏是以蔡文姬怀念故国开始的。曹操遣汉使董祀、周近赎迎文姬回国，但是文姬的丈夫左贤王不准她携带儿女同往，文姬陷入了“喜得生还逢圣君，去往两情难俱陈”的内心矛盾中。经董祀的劝导，文姬毅然离别丈夫、儿女回到了邺下。但是，董祀却因周近的猜忌和误奏，被曹操判下了“行为不端，私通匈奴”的死罪。文姬闻讯挺身而出，在曹操面前据实力谏，禀述董祀爱国忠君的真相，曹操赦回了董祀。几年之后，文姬的儿女随匈奴王单于来到汉朝，母子骨肉重逢。经过曹操的撮合，文姬同董祀结了婚。起先，文姬陷匈奴，沉溺在悲哀里，董祀把她救了，以后文姬又救董祀免于死罪，因此曹操赞誉他们是一对“生死鸳鸯”。戏就在亲人团聚、重订鸳盟的喜悦气氛中结束了。
    北京人民艺术剧院排演这出戏，在艺术表现和处理上有许多新的尝试。剧中采取川剧的手法，以“胡笳十八拍”作为帮腔，丰富了话剧的表现力，帮助演员更好地刻划角色的精神面貌。其中有一场是由演员朱琳演唱的。这是当文姬归国途中，行抵长安郊外的一个夜晚，文姬在父亲蔡邕墓前手抚焦尾琴，唱出了“今别子呵归故乡，旧怨平呵新怨长，泣血仰头呵诉苍苍，胡为生我呵独罹此殃！”琴瑟哀怨，声腔婉回。在戏剧的高潮和重要的转折处，还用民族乐曲增强气氛。曲子是金紫光等以“胡笳十八拍”古琴曲作为基调谱成的。帮腔是特约北方昆曲剧院青年演员李淑君演唱的。
    在排演中，剧作者郭沫若为演员们作了报告。演员们认真钻研有关曹操和蔡文姬的历史资料，每天还坚持练身段和眼神等基本功。
