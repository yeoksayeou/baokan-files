Chairman, fellow committee members:

In this conference, I have listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the 1959 National Budget, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report from the CPPCC Standing Committee. I feel very excited and I completely agree with and support these reports.

Now I would like to express some personal opinions on the following two issues:

Regarding the Tibet Issue

First, I, as a Chinese person, cannot but feel indignant about the attempt by British imperialism and Indian expansionists to split our motherland and openly insult our national leaders. As everyone knows, before the open rebellion by a small number of upper-class Tibetan rebels, some reactionary Indian newspapers had already openly carried out inflammatory propaganda, and the foreign base for the Tibetan reactionary rebels was set up in Kalimpong, India. After our People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa quelled the armed rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary clique, these British imperialists and Indian expansionists, who had long supported and planned this rebellious plot, were grief-stricken and extremely annoyed. Therefore, they further viciously slandered the Chinese people and clamored, saying things like: "Tibet is an independent country," "Tibet is not Chinese territory," "Chinese people are barbarians," and publicly insulted our national leaders in Mumbai, and so on. But these shameless lies can absolutely not obliterate the true facts. Anyone with a little historical and geographical knowledge—whether Chinese or foreign—knows that Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient times. As early as the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the Han and Tibetan peoples widely established economic and cultural relations. By the Yuan Dynasty, the Han, Mongolian, and Tibetan ethnic groups of China had formed a unified country. Even the title of the Dalai Lama was bestowed by the Chinese feudal dynasty. Even during the Kuomintang rule, Tibet was not, as the Indian interventionists said, "an independent country." May I ask, if Tibet was an independent country, which country in the world established diplomatic relations with Tibet? I lived in Nanjing for a long time and know that the director of the Tibetan local government's office in Nanjing was named Gongque Zhongni; I also know that the director of the Nanjing government's office in Lhasa was a Shanxi native named Liu Bochen. These ironclad facts cannot be overturned. How can they talk nonsense and say that Tibet is an "independent country"? The British imperialists and Indian expansionists, as well as a small number of upper-class Tibetan rebels under their protection, insist on twisting their tongues and saying that Tibet is an "independent country." This is truly the height of absurdity. Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all. Their aim is nothing more than to split off the sacred territory of our motherland and turn it into their colony on the one hand, and to collude with foreign countries and sell out their ancestors, turning themselves into traitors of the nation and people who will be infamous for ten thousand years on the other. However, their beautiful dreams have been completely shattered by the iron fists of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country, including all the monks and laypeople of Tibet. However, they are not reconciled to their defeat and are still playing tricks, saying things like "helping reconciliation," "mediating," and holding round-table conferences to continue interfering in China's internal affairs. Some politicians even plan to put forward suggestions such as "letting the Panchen Lama or a Chinese ambassador or special envoy meet with the Dalai Lama," and so on, to continue deceiving the Chinese people and world opinion. These conspiracies can only be further bankrupt in front of the Chinese people who have suffered from imperialist oppression and aggression in the past but have now stood up. I solemnly advise the Indian expansionists who inherit the mantle of British imperialism here: the Chinese people cannot be intimidated or deceived. Attempting to turn China's sacred territory—Tibet—into a colony of India, or using the rebellion launched by a small number of reactionary groups in Tibet to provoke the friendly relations between the people of the two great countries of China and India, can only be a futile effort. China has never interfered in India's internal affairs, but it will never allow Indian expansionists to interfere in China's internal affairs. For the sake of the interests of our two nations and peoples who have just been liberated from imperialist enslavement and oppression, for the sake of the interests of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world, please clear your heads and stop doing these foolish things. Rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff, and turn back to the shore. Otherwise, you will only end up with a bloody nose and a more shameful defeat.

Second, I would like to talk about some situations and problems I recently inspected in the people's communes in Taigu County, Shanxi Province. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country's industrial and agricultural production has achieved great successes. With the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, a high tide of people's communes emerged in the rural areas of the country, in accordance with the demands of the broad masses of peasants. The movement of people's communes developed rapidly, and by the end of last year, the rural areas of the country had basically been communized. Since the establishment of the people's communes, many communes across the country have implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply systems on the basis of agricultural bumper harvests, and the lives of the broad masses of peasants have been significantly improved. This great and unprecedented social change in the countryside is something we should be proud of and celebrate.

In the summer of 1956, I went to the countryside of Shanxi and saw advanced agricultural production cooperatives. At that time, I believed that the cooperativization movement led by the Party in the countryside was the correct path to transform China's backward agriculture. After the national communization of the people, I really wanted to have the opportunity to go to Shanxi again for an on-the-spot visit. I was very happy to receive the warm help from the Shanxi Province and Taigu County People's Committees before the convening of this conference, which enabled me to inspect the Huochun People's Commune in Taigu County in a very short period of time. For me, this was another profound education and encouragement from the broad masses of peasants. The Huochun People's Commune is formed by the merger of twenty-seven advanced cooperatives. There are a total of forty natural villages, divided into twenty-five management areas (production brigades), and one hundred and forty-three production teams. There are a total of three thousand eight hundred and fifty-three households of farmers, with a population of thirty-eight thousand four hundred and sixty people. The land is one hundred and thirty-six thousand four hundred mu, of which paddy fields account for more than ninety percent. The commune covers an area of about thirty li, with convenient transportation and good water conservancy conditions. The peasants happily said: "There are two rivers in the north and south, and the Minsheng Canal in the middle. Although it is not a long flowing water, it is also as good as a small Jinci Temple." Five villages in the whole commune have realized water conservancy electrification, with good production conditions and high output. The commune also has tool repair factories, fertilizer factories, brick and tile factories, sugar factories, wineries, and non-staple food processing plants. In addition, the commune has one agricultural middle school, one ordinary middle school, and nine complete primary schools; there is one supply and marketing cooperative, seven supply and marketing branches, and nine supply and marketing stations. In terms of living welfare, the commune has basically implemented public canteens. Kindergartens, nurseries, nursing homes, hospitals, etc. have all been greatly developed. Now I will focus on introducing the agricultural production and living welfare undertakings of the Huochun People's Commune to everyone.

Agricultural Production

In terms of agricultural production plans, the commune's 1959 agricultural production plan was formulated on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. Among them, the grain production plan is to achieve an average yield of 607 jin per mu, which is double the yield of 315 jin per mu in 1958; the cotton plan is to achieve an average yield of 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which is nearly double the yield of 43 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1958. For other oil crops, the average yield is required to be 300 jin per mu, which is higher than in 1958. According to the members, this year's agricultural production targets are formulated on a reliable basis, and they are very confident of achieving these planned targets if there are no special natural disasters. In terms of measures to increase production per unit of agriculture, they have done a lot of work, and every member is full of enthusiasm and is very confident in applying the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In terms of soil, all the land has been deeply ploughed to a depth of more than one chi. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased from 65 dan last year to 100 dan. In terms of water conservancy, because of the large-scale construction of reservoirs last year, the irrigated area has been greatly expanded, ensuring a bumper harvest of grain this year. Winter wheat has been improved and universally densely planted, and the amount of seeds sown per mu has been increased from 20 jin in the past to about 50 jin, and the growth is now good. Full preparations have also been made in terms of plant protection and pest and disease prevention. Winter wheat has generally undergone spring field management, and topdressing and irrigation have been carried out. They have also planted experimental fields and cultivated garden-style fields. Because of the tight rural labor force, many improvements have also been made in terms of tools. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, the commune also summarized the production and leadership experience of 1958. Recently, it has also implemented hierarchical management and layered responsibility system, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses for production.

Living and Welfare Undertakings

Regarding the living and welfare undertakings of the commune, I went to the Chaoyang Management Area of the commune for in-depth understanding. The situation is briefly described as follows:

1. Public Canteens: There are a total of eleven canteens in the management area, and each canteen is well-run. The canteen environment is clean, and tables and chairs are provided in the room, so that members can sit comfortably and eat. The kitchen is clean, and the cooks are all young women from the countryside, all wearing white work clothes and with kind attitudes. The kitchen water has been semi-mechanized, and water can be directly sent to the kitchen without manual carrying, so as to save labor. When I visited, the members were having dinner, and the dining room was in good order, and the members talked freely, fully demonstrating the warmth and joyful mood of a socialist family. The canteen hygiene is very good, and the bowls and chopsticks are disinfected with boiling water every meal, which is a very commendable thing. The canteen has a weekly meal schedule, adopts a variety of coarse grains, and guarantees that members eat their fill, eat well, eat with taste, and everyone is satisfied, and non-staple foods are not lacking and can be fully supplied. When I visited, they were supplying fresh spinach and celery. The commune also has tofu workshops and pig farms to improve the lives of the members. Members who are old, sick, or have many children can also start their own meals at home voluntarily if it is inconvenient for them to eat in the canteen. Canteen management is completely democratized. If members have any opinions, they can express their opinions with big-character posters or orally. This spirit is worth learning from.

2. Childcare and Elderly Care: There are a total of seventeen nurseries in the management area, and there are currently ninety-eight children in care, accounting for only 39% of the children who should be cared for. This work still needs further development. There is one nursing home with a total of twelve elderly people. They were all "Five Guarantees" households of the former advanced agricultural cooperatives. The commune takes special care of them and has a separate small stove, and the standard for grain supply is more fine grains. There are many gaps in the nursing home, and some elderly people still automatically grow some vegetables if their physical strength allows. One elderly man said with emotion: "Without the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have lived to this day." Every time he eats, he bows to the portrait of Chairman Mao to express his respect.

3. Health and Medical Work: The environmental sanitation in the area is very good, and the streets and toilets are equipped with wooden lids, and the houses are cleaned inside and outside. Now, it has achieved three circles out of the village (livestock, pigs, sheep), and the four pests have basically been eliminated. Most members have developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene. The hospital is divided into Chinese and Western medicine departments, and in addition to internal medicine and surgery, there are also obstetrics and gynecology departments. 100% of pregnant women in the commune have gone to the hospital to give birth. In order to do a good job in serving the health of the members, the hospital has service signs in every public canteen. As long as men and women who are sick hang their names on the signs, doctors can go to the members' homes to diagnose the disease. The hospital is now also conducting a health registration file for the members, and the farmers feel that the hospital is of great help to them.

4. In general, the living standards of farmers have been improving year by year. Judging only from the income of farmers, the average net income per person in 1957 was 42 yuan, 61.7 yuan in 1958, and the plan for 1959 is to reach an average net income per person of 120 yuan, which is double that of 1958. According to the director of the commune, in 1958, due to excessive investment in capital construction, there was waste in expenditure, and the total expenditure for the whole year accounted for 45% of the total income; the plan for 1959 is to streamline and save expenses and reduce the total expenditure to 22.9% of the total income.

The above situation mainly reflects some of the brilliant achievements made by the Huochun People's Commune in agricultural production and living welfare undertakings. Now, I would like to put forward some immature views and suggestions based on my personal understanding.

1. After this inspection, I deeply realized that the people's commune is indeed the best form to accelerate the great development of agricultural production in our country. At the same time, it is also the form that the farmers of the whole country need and love the most. Only through this form can we adapt to the continuous development of agricultural productive forces in our country. Although, in the initial stage of establishing the people's commune, it is inevitable to encounter some difficulties because of lack of experience. This is only a very individual problem. In general, after the establishment of the people's commune, agricultural production and farmers' lives have been significantly developed and improved, and have been enthusiastically loved by the farmers. I firmly believe that only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country can the people's commune quickly move towards the road of consolidation and development. Let us all work together towards this bright future!

2. I believe that to run the people's commune well, we must, in accordance with the spirit of diligence and thriftiness in running the commune, strengthen financial management, save expenses, avoid extravagance and waste, and increase the income of members. This is an important key to giving play to the enthusiasm of members for production and running the people's commune well. In the future, we should also pay attention to guiding the people's commune to do a good job in economic investigation and research, calculate production costs, obey the national production plan, and reasonably arrange the commune's production plan, so as to improve the utilization rate of the commune's fixed assets and working capital and labor productivity.

3. Soil, water conservancy, and fertilizer are the three main keys to agricultural production increase. The central and local scientific research institutions should combine with the people's commune to do a good job in this comprehensive research work. In different soils, find out the relationship between water and fertilizer and agricultural production.

4. After the communization of the people, small-scale production has become large-scale production. In the future, we should also pay attention to doing a good job in plant and animal protection and the storage and preservation of agricultural products to prevent losses. Last year, due to the large-scale bumper harvests of the people's commune, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and radishes could not be stored, and rotting occurred in some places. It is hoped that agricultural research institutions will help the rural people's commune do a good job in processing and storage in the future.

5. After the communization of the people, members all go to public canteens to eat. In order to make members eat well, eat their fill, eat with taste, and meet nutritional hygiene standards, it is recommended that relevant departments conduct nutritional surveys of farmers' food in different regions of the country to improve rural recipes and ensure the health of farmers.

Finally, I wish the conference a success and all members good health.

### 回头是岸，印度野心家！  乔启明委员的发言

专栏：

    回头是岸，印度野心家！
    乔启明委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    在这次大会中听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划报告、李先念副总理的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告、李维汉副主席政协常委会的工作报告，感到十分兴奋，我完全同意并且拥护这些报告。
    现在我就以下两个问题发表一些个人的意见：
    关于西藏问题
    第一、英帝国主义和印度野心分子，企图分裂我们祖国和公然侮辱我们国家领导人的问题，凡是一个中国人不能不对此义愤填胸。众所周知，西藏少数上层叛乱分子，在未公开叛乱之前，印度一些反动报纸就已经公开进行煽动宣传，而且西藏反动叛乱分子的国外基地就设在印度的噶伦堡。自我人民解放军驻拉萨部队平息西藏反动集团武装叛乱之后，这些长期支持和策划这一叛乱阴谋的英帝国主义和印度野心分子，便如丧考妣，懊恼万分，因而，他们对中国人民更进一步地发出了恶毒的诬蔑，大肆叫嚣，说什么：“西藏是独立的国家”“西藏不是中国的领土”、“中国人是野蛮人”，并在孟买公开侮辱我们国家领袖等等不一而足。但是这些无耻的谎言，绝对抹杀不了真正的事实。凡是稍有历史常识和地理常识的人——不管他是中国人或外国人——都知道西藏自古以来就是中国不可分割的一部分。远在隋唐时代，汉、藏两族人民就广泛的建立了经济和文化的关系，到了元朝时期，中国的汉、蒙、藏等民族便结成了一个统一的国家。连达赖喇嘛的称号也是中国封建王朝封的。就是在国民党统治时期，西藏也并不像印度干涉者所说的那样：“成了独立国家”。试问如果西藏是独立国家，世界上哪一个国家和西藏建立过外交关系？我久住南京，知道当时西藏地方政府派驻南京办事处的主任叫贡却仲尼；也知道当时南京政府派驻拉萨办事处的主任是山西人，叫刘波臣。这些铁的事实都是推翻不了的，怎么能信口雌黄说西藏是“独立国”呢？英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子以及在他们卵翼下的一小撮西藏上层叛乱分子，硬要歪着舌头把西藏说成是“独立国”，这真是滑天下之大稽。司马昭之心，路人皆知。他们无非是一方面企图把我们祖国神圣的领土分裂出去，变为他们的殖民地；而另一方面是里通外国，出卖自己祖先，把自己变成遗臭万年的国家民族的罪人。但是，他们美妙的梦想，在英勇无比的中国人民解放军和全国人民包括西藏全体僧俗人民铁拳下彻底粉碎了。然而他们还不甘心失败，仍然在耍花招，说什么“帮助和解”、“进行调停”、召开什么圆桌会议，来继续干涉中国内政。某些政治家还计划提出什么“让班禅喇嘛或者中国大使、特使去会见达赖喇嘛”的建议等等，继续欺骗中国人民和世界舆论。这些阴谋在过去饱经帝国主义压迫侵略但是今天已经站起来的中国人民面前，只能是进一步的破产。我在这里严正地忠告继承英帝国主义衣钵的印度扩张主义分子：中国人是吓不倒、也骗不了的，企图把中国神圣的领土——西藏变为印度的殖民地，或者借西藏一小撮反动集团发动的叛乱，来挑拨中印两个伟大国家人民的友好关系，只能是徒劳心机。中国从未干涉过印度的内政，但是也决不允许印度扩张主义分子干涉我们中国的内政。为了我们两个刚刚从帝国主义奴役压迫下解放不久的国家民族的利益着想，为了亚洲以及全世界爱好和平人民的利益着想，请你们头脑清醒一点，不要再继续干这些愚蠢的勾当。悬崖勒马、回头是岸。否则，只能是碰得头破血流遭到更可耻的失败。
    第二、我谈一下我最近视察山西太谷县人民公社一些情况和问题。几年以来，全国人民在中国共产党正确领导下，我国工农业生产获得了很大的成就。随着一九五八年农业生产大跃进，在全国农村中，根据广大的农民要求，又出现了人民公社的高潮。人民公社运动发展的很快，到了去年年底，全国农村已基本上都公社化了。从人民公社建立以后，全国各地有许多公社在农业丰产的基础上实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，广大农民的生活显著的得到改善。这一伟大史无前例的农村社会变革是值得我们骄傲和庆幸的。
    在一九五六年夏季我到过山西农村看过高级农业生产合作社，当时，我认为党在农村所领导的合作化运动是改造我国落后农业的正确道路。全国人民公社化后，我很想有机会再去山西实地看看。我很高兴的在这次大会召开以前，得到山西省和太谷县人民委员会热情帮助，使我能在很短的时间内视察了太谷县胡村乡火箭人民公社。对我来说，这是又一次的受到广大农民的深刻教育和鼓舞。火箭人民公社是由二十七个高级社合并组成的。共有四十个自然村，分为二十五个管理区（生产大队），一百四十三个生产队。共有农户三千八百五十三户，人口三万八千四百六十人。土地十三万六千四百亩，其中水地占百分之九十以上。公社范围约三十里左右，交通便利，水利条件很好。农民高兴的说：“南北两道河，当中民生渠，虽然不是长流水，也顶一个小晋祠。”全社已有五个村实现水利电气化，生产条件好，产量高。公社还设有工具修配厂、肥料厂、砖瓦厂、制糖厂、制酒厂和副食品加工厂。此外公社还有农业中学一所，普通中学一所，完全小学九所；有一个供销社，七个供销分店和九个供销站。在生活福利方面，公社已基本食堂化。幼儿园、托儿所、敬老院、医院等都得到很大的发展。现在我只把火箭人民公社的农业生产和生活福利事业着重的向大家介绍一下。
    农业生产
    在农业生产计划方面，该社一九五九年农业生产计划是在一九五八年大跃进基础上制订的。其中粮食生产计划平均亩产六百零七斤，要比一九五八年亩产三百一十五斤增加一倍；棉花计划平均亩产皮棉八十斤，要比一九五八年亩产皮棉四十三斤增加将近一倍。其它油料作物，要求平均亩产三百斤，要比一九五八年有所提高。根据社员的表示，今年农业生产指标是在可靠的基础上制订的，如果没有特殊自然灾害，他们很有信心的达到这个计划指标。在农业单位增产措施方面，他们作了很多的工作，各个社员都是干劲冲天，对运用农业“八字宪法”极有信心。在土壤方面，全部土地进行了深翻一尺以上。每亩施肥由去年六十五担增加到一百担。在水利方面，因为去年大修水库，大大地扩大了灌溉面积，保证了今年粮食大丰收。小麦做到优种化和普遍密植，每亩播种量由过去二十斤提高到五十斤左右，现在生长情况良好。在植物保护防止病虫方面，也进行了充分准备工作。冬小麦普遍进行春季田间管理，并进行了追肥和灌水。他们还种了试验田和耕作园田化。因为农村劳动力紧张，在工具方面，也作了不少改进工作。同时该社在党的领导下，还总结了一九五八年生产和领导经验。最近又贯彻了分级管理，以及分层负责制，充分发挥了群众生产积极性。
    生活福利事业
    关于公社生活福利事业方面，我是到该社朝阳管理区深入了解的。其情况简述如下：
    一、公共食堂：该管区共有食堂十一个，各个食堂都办得很好。食堂环境清洁，室内均设有桌凳，社员可舒适坐食，厨房整洁，炊事员均系农村青年妇女，全部着有白色工作服，态度和蔼，厨房用水已实现半机械化，可直接将水送入厨房，不用人工挑水，以节约劳力。当我参观时社员正在用饭，餐室井井有条，社员交谈自如，充分表现出社会主义大家庭的温暖和愉快的心情。食堂卫生工作很好，每餐碗筷均用开水消毒，这是一件很值得称赞的大事。食堂每周订有饭表，采取粗粮细作，花样翻新，保证社员吃饱、吃好、吃的有味道，人人满意，副食品亦不缺乏，并能充分供应。当我参观的时候，他们正供应新鲜的菠菜和芹菜。公社还有豆腐作坊、养猪场，以便社员改善生活。凡是年老有病或是小孩多的社员，如因在食堂吃饭不便，也可以根据自愿在家起伙。食堂管理完全民主化。社员如有意见可用大字报或口头表示自己的意见。这种精神是值得我们学习的。
    二、托幼敬老工作：该管区共有托儿所十七处，现在受托幼儿共九十八名。只占到应受托幼儿百分之三十九。这项工作还有待进一步的发展。敬老院一处，共有老人十二名。他们都是以前高级农业社的“五保”户，公社对他们特殊照顾，另设有小灶，粮食供应标准是细粮多。在敬老院内隙地不少，有些老年人在体力许可条件下，他们还自动的种些蔬菜。有一位老人感动地说：“没有中国共产党和毛主席，我那里能活到今天。”他每到吃饭的时候，还向毛主席像行一鞠躬礼，表示敬意。
    三、卫生医疗工作：该区环境卫生搞得很好，街道厕所均备有木盖，住家内外打扫清洁。现在已做到三圈出村（牲畜、猪、羊），四害已基本消灭。大多数社员已养成讲卫生的习惯。医院分中西医两部，除内外科外，还设有妇产科，公社孕妇已百分之百都到医院生产。医院为做好对社员健康服务工作，在每一公共食堂都制有服务牌，凡是有病的男女只要把自己的名字挂在牌上，医生就可到社员家中诊病。医院现在还进行一种对社员健康登记档案，农民感觉医院对自己帮助很大。
    四、总的来说，农民生活逐年提高。单从农民收入看，在一九五七年每人平均纯入为四十二元，一九五八年为六十一元七角，一九五九年计划达到每人平均纯收入为一百二十元，要比一九五八年增加一倍。据该社社长讲：在一九五八年，因为基本建设投资过大，开支有浪费现象，全年总支出占到总收入百分之四十五；一九五九年计划要精简节约把总支出压缩到总收入的百分之二十二点九。
    以上情况主要是反映了火箭人民公社在农业生产和生活福利事业方面所做出的一些辉煌灿烂的成绩。现在就我个人的认识提出几点不成熟的看法和建议。
    1、经过这次视察以后，我深深的体会到，人民公社确是加速我国农业生产大发展的最好形式。同时，它也是全国农民最需要最喜爱的形式。只有通过这种形式，才能适应我国农业生产力不断的向前发展。虽然，在我们建立人民公社的初期，因为工作没有经验，也难免遇一些困难。这不过是很个别的问题。总的来说，在人民公社成立后，农业生产和农民生活都得到了很显著的发展和提高，并且受到农民热情爱护。我深信只有在中国共产党和毛主席英明的领导下和全国人民热情的拥护下，人民公社就可以很快地走向巩固与发展的道路。我们大家应该一致努力向这个美好的前景迈进吧！
    2、我认为，要办好人民公社必须本着中央历次指示的勤俭办社精神，加强财务管理，节约开支，避免铺张浪费，增加社员收入，这是发挥社员生产积极性和办好人民公社的重要关键。今后还应注意指导人民公社做好经济调查研究，计算生产成本，服从国家生产计划，合理安排公社生产计划，以提高公社固定资产与流动资金利用率和劳动生产率。
    3、土壤、水利和肥料是农业增产三个主要关键，中央与地方科学研究机关应结合人民公社做好这一综合性的研究工作。在不同土壤中，找出水、肥对农业生产的相互关系。
    4、人民公社化后，小生产变为大生产，今后还应注意做好动植物防护和农产品保管储藏工作，以防止损失。去年人民公社由于大量丰产，对马铃薯、甘薯、萝卜不会储藏，有些地方发生腐烂现象。希望农业研究机关今后多帮助农村人民公社做好加工储藏工作。
    5、人民公社化后，社员都到公共食堂吃饭，要使社员吃好、吃饱、吃的有味道又合乎营养卫生，建议有关部门在全国不同地区应进行农民食物营养调查，改进农村食谱，保证农民健康。
    最后祝大会成功，祝全体委员健康。
