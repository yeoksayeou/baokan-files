Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 17th – The Eleventh Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) adopted a corresponding resolution regarding the ten-year work report made by the CMEA Secretary, Fadeyev.

The resolution stated that the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, established in 1949, plays a significant role in organizing the planned economic cooperation of socialist countries and in assisting and uniting forces aimed at developing socialist economies.

The resolution continued, stating that all activities of the Council are based on the principles inherent in the new type of relations increasingly forming among socialist countries, namely, respecting the equality of sovereign states and the fraternal mutual assistance of national interests.

The resolution stated that in the past decade, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance has done significant work in developing economic ties aimed at improving the level of production technology, strengthening the socialist international division of labor, and expanding commodity exchanges among socialist countries. Member states of the Council are rapidly developing industrial production. The increase in industrial product output in 1958 compared to 1949 is as follows: Albania increased by 3.5 times, Bulgaria increased by 1.9 times, Hungary increased by 1.3 times, the German Democratic Republic increased by 1.4 times, Poland increased by 1.8 times, Romania increased by 1.7 times, the Soviet Union increased by 1.5 times, and Czechoslovakia increased by 1.3 times. Other socialist countries are also developing their economies smoothly. During the same period, China's industrial product output increased by about six times, Korea increased by three times, and Mongolia increased by one time. Vietnam has increased industrial production by 3.6 times in the past three years.

The resolution stated that the high rate of economic development and continuous growth of production are common laws of socialist economic development. In the past five years, the average growth rate of industrial output in the entire socialist camp was 11%, while that of the entire capitalist world was less than 3%. The resolution stated that the economies of socialist countries are developing in a planned and proportionate manner and rely on fraternal mutual assistance, thus ensuring the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people. The resolution stated that commodity circulation between these countries has greatly increased. Their mutual trade volume accounts for almost 60% of their total foreign trade, while trade with Eastern socialist countries accounts for more than 70%.

When discussing trade with capitalist countries, the resolution stated that countries of the socialist camp actively advocate the development of mutually beneficial trade with capitalist countries. The resolution stated that according to the principles proposed by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance—scientific and technological cooperation among member states has played a significant role in the common prosperity of member states' national economies. The bilateral and multilateral exchanges of scientific and technological achievements and production experience conducted by the standing professional committees of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance have accelerated the establishment of many new national economic sectors in member states. This enables countries that were previously lagging in industrial development to rapidly approach the level of advanced industrial countries in the socialist family.

The resolution pointed out that the assistance provided by more developed countries to countries with relatively less developed economies is of great significance. The Soviet Union plays a very important role in supporting the development of the economies of the people's democracies.

The resolution stated that the current important measures are to further strengthen the specialization and cooperation of production, standardization of enterprises, and unification of equipment in major industrial sectors—construction and agriculture. Cooperation and integration of forces should be carried out in scientific research and design work.

The resolution stated that in the economic competition between socialism and capitalism, socialist countries have all the necessary prerequisites to win this competition. The activities of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance are of particularly great significance in realizing this historically significant task.

The resolution stated that the Council's meeting believes that it is necessary to further strengthen the work of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and its various institutions in uniting and coordinating the production of member states, so as to enable the world socialist system to gain a faster advantage over capitalism in material production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 17th – The four-day Eleventh Session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance closed here yesterday.

The communique adopted at the meeting stated that the delegations participating in the meeting included member states of the Council: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. Representatives from Vietnam, China, Korea, and Mongolia were invited to attend the meeting as observers.

The communique stated that the meeting listened to the report on the ten-year work of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance by the Council's Secretary, Fadeyev, and adopted a corresponding resolution. The meeting discussed the reports submitted by the standing committees of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and discussed the economic ties among member states of the Council based on the prospective plans for the development of the most important industrial sectors of various countries before 1965.

The meeting discussed the issue of prioritizing the expansion of coking coal production in the European people's democracies. It is expected that by 1965, the total coal extraction volume of these countries will increase by 21%, of which the extraction volume of coking coal will increase by 53.5%.

The meeting discussed the issue of increasing the production of ferrous metals and developing the raw material base for ferrous metals in the European people's democracies. It is expected that from 1959 to 1965, member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will greatly develop the production of iron, steel, steel products, and steel pipes. Compared with 1958, the output of steel and steel products in the European people's democracies will increase by 70% by 1965.

The communique stated that the meeting discussed the issue of further increasing the reserves and production of non-ferrous metals by member states on the basis of joint cooperation. It is expected that the supply of non-ferrous metals from the Soviet Union will greatly increase.

The meeting also discussed the issue of the integration of power systems among member states of the Council and the mutual transmission of electricity, in order to better guarantee the needs of the European people's democracies. From 1959 to 1964, joint power transmission lines will be established between the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary; between Romania and Czechoslovakia; between Hungary and the western Ukrainian power system of the Soviet Union; and between Poland and the Kaliningrad power system of the Soviet Union.

The communique stated that the meeting also discussed proposals related to the production specialization and cooperation of some machinery manufacturing products. In order to complete the formulated proposals, countries will strengthen cooperation in this area: exchanging the latest scientific achievements and experience in adopting advanced technologies and the most perfect technical operating procedures.

The communique pointed out that the volume of commodity circulation among member states of the Council will greatly increase.

The communique pointed out that member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will further consolidate and expand economic cooperation with Eastern socialist countries—China, Vietnam, Korea, and Mongolia. While developing trade with socialist countries, they will also further develop mutually beneficial trade with capitalist countries.
