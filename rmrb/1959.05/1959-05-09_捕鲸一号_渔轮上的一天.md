A Day on the "Whaling No. 1" Fishing Vessel
By our reporter Yao Shifu

　　The thick fog of dawn shrouded the sea, and the Haiyang Island, more than seventy nautical miles away from Dalian Port, was hidden in a world of myth and fantasy. At four o'clock in the morning, we boarded the "Whaling No. 1" fishing vessel by sampan. At this time, in the quiet embrace of the harbor, red and white lights suddenly lit up, the anchor winch made a loud noise, and the whistle sounded a long blast. It tells us that China's first "Whaling No. 1" fishing vessel, specializing in catching "Sea Overlord" (fin whale), has set sail.

　　"Old Captain"

　　It is now dawn, and the ship seems to be sailing in a steam boiler, and it is not yet possible to catch whales. Taking this opportunity, I couldn't wait to ask Master Liu Yusheng, who is respectfully called "Old Captain," this question: "Can we catch fin whales today?"

　　The "Old Captain" is fifty-seven years old this year. He is an old man who has experienced the wind and frost of the sea. His childhood and adulthood were spent as a handyman on Japanese whaling ships. Not long after liberation, he became the captain of China's first whaling ship "No. 114" and was also China's first whaling gunner. He has made many achievements. Now, due to poor health, he specializes in training new gunners. He told us: "It's a long story. Not only you, but we have been missing fin whales so much that we are lovesick."

　　Why do people miss fin whales so much? It turns out that fin whales are one of the larger types of whales, generally weighing dozens of tons. Their whole body is a treasure and has high economic value. The pituitary gland alone is worth five million yuan per ton. But its swimming speed is very fast, reaching up to seventeen nautical miles per hour, and it is very clever. Therefore, not only do coastal fishermen regard it as the Dragon King, but even fishing vessels have to give it some leeway. Whaling is still a new thing in our country. Although there are several whaling ships in our country, only "Whaling No. 1" can deal with fin whales.

　　"Whaling No. 1" is a fishing vessel made in China. Since it was put into trial production last year, "Old Captain" and gunner Shi Sha have each shot two fin whales, which are the earliest four fin whales caught in our country using modern production tools. This year, "Whaling No. 1" has officially been put into production. The gunners watched the fin whales spewing clouds and mist on the sea surface, but as soon as they heard the sound of the engine, they cunningly sank to the bottom of the sea.

　　This made Shi Sha and Deputy Gunner Xu Xiyi, two Communist Party members, very annoyed.

　　Hide-and-seek

　　Just as we were talking, the captain's voice suddenly came from the wheelhouse: "Whales found." All crew members were in their positions within a minute and plunged into the tense battle. "Whaling No. 1" chased a stray whale, but chased it for more than an hour without any results. Suddenly, the telegraph operator, Xiao Kong, reported: "Captain, ship No. 504 sent a telegram saying that fin whales were found in area 32, asking if we want to go?" "Go!" the captain replied. An hour later, our ship arrived in area 32. Before long, a semi-circular object appeared behind the ship a hundred meters away. It was spewing white water columns, revealing a table-sized dorsal fin, sometimes sinking, sometimes floating, truly a huge monster. Our ship quickly made a right turn, trying to catch up, but when we reached the place it had swam through, the monster sank to the bottom of the sea again. The ship moved at full speed in the direction the whale was heading, but this fellow suddenly appeared to our right rear. It turned out we were chasing too hard and had overtaken it. The engine made a sharp sound, and the ship drew a full circle on the waves and chased after it again. ... We circled around like this for a full hour and a half, but still with no results.

　　The sun had already risen high in the sky. The people on the lookout tower, the bow, and the top of the ship were constantly reporting that two whale couples had appeared here, and two mother-child whales had been found there. Many water columns rose and fell on the ocean, creating a wonderful scene. The fish school was chasing a patch of yellow plankton, and our ship was also closely following the fish school, launching a horizontal and vertical interception chase.

　　Chasing and chasing, our ship was still chasing towards the front of the fish, but the whale appeared to our right front again, and at an even greater distance.

　　The First Prey

　　At ten o'clock in the morning, gunner Shi Sha suddenly turned around and asked his teacher, Liu Yusheng, for his opinion: "Old Captain, I think this one is honest, let's shoot this one!" The "Old Captain" showed a happy expression and praised his beloved apprentice for having his own ideas: "That's right, don't turn around randomly, shoot this big one!" So, the "Old Captain," who was working while sick, suddenly became like a young man, standing on the railing of the building seat with both feet, and issuing orders to the helmsman following Shi Sha's gestures: "Two speeds (i.e., half speed)!" "Right rudder!" "Three speeds (full speed)!" "Stop!"

　　Just as our ship was steadily stopped on a southeast-facing sea surface, a large and a small mother-child whale swam past outside the shooting range to the right front. Someone on the ship anxiously called to shoot, but the "Old Captain" calmly commanded: "Don't pay attention to it, shoot this big one!" At this instant, a dark whale back appeared not far to the right front. When it spewed a second water column, its body exposed in front of our cannon muzzle, "Fire!" "Fire!" "Fire!" With a bang, Deputy Gunner Xu Xiyi fired the first shot, and the nylon rope on the cannon arrow whirred and flew into the sea. But there was no splash on the water surface. Did it hit or not? Suddenly, the workers on the deck opened the pulley, and the nylon rope was tight. Only then did everyone shout in unison: "Hit it!" "Hit it!" The fishing vessel moved forward at full speed following the direction of the rope traction. In less than a quarter of an hour, the rope had become a vertical line sinking to the bottom of the sea. This shows that the fish was hit in a vital spot and could not breathe. Captain Lao Yu walked out of the wheelhouse, pulled on the rope to test its tightness, and decided to raise the fish. Everyone on the deck took off their leather jackets and worked nervously. The winch turned creakingly, the rope became tighter and tighter, and people's moods became more and more tense. Finally, a swallowtail-shaped whale tail floated on the sea surface to the right of the ship. A long strip of white shimmered under the green ripples. The old captain told me that this was the fish's body. After a while, a fin whale floated up. What a big fellow! It was seventeen or eight meters long. The crew lowered the sampan, used a thick iron wire to wrap tightly around the tail of the whale, and then used an iron chain to lock the tail tightly to the ship's right舷. When the air gun was inserted into the whale's abdomen, which was covered with long "whiskers," and compressed air was passed through, the fin whale bulged its big belly, and we left it to our brother fishing vessel No. 504 to tow back to the processing plant.

　　New Hand - New Record

　　The sun passed noon, and the wind and waves on the sea surface had increased. But no one cared whether the wind was strong or weak, and the bow turned again to area 32. Chief Mate Wan Jiaqi and "Fish Eye" Wang Ji'an on the lookout tower reported that a fin whale was swimming north under the sea surface. Soon, this whale was also targeted by our ship. Xu Xiyi held the breech tightly, Shi Sha made various hand gestures, and the chief mate, the captain, and the old captain alternately conveyed various driving orders: "Left rudder angle!"
"Three speeds!" "Good!" Before people could blink, a behemoth had appeared on the surface of the water, forming a human shape with our ship, just within firing range. Xu Xiyi fired another shot, the cannon arrow skimming the water surface, like a motorboat, lifting a string of waves,窜过the fish's body a meter away. "Oops, it grazed past!" Someone said with regret. However, strangely enough, the nylon rope was constantly released, but it was still getting tighter and tighter. "Hit it again!" This time, it was Shi Sha and the "Old Captain" who shouted cheers at the same time. They congratulated this young new whaling gunner for creating a new record of hitting two fin whales in one day. But this monster was still galloping forward with two nylon ropes like a wild horse, and constantly floating to the surface to spout water columns and pant. The water column reflected the red sun, and a colorful rainbow appeared on the sea. Xu Xiyi calmed down and gave the whale another shot, finally ending its life. I looked at my watch, the time was twelve ten, less than two hours since hitting the first fish. At this time, everyone on the ship praised: "Good fellow, Lao Xu hit only two small whales after firing more than thirty shots last year. Today, in two hours, he hit two fin whales in a row. He's capable!"

　　A New Page in Whaling History

　　The setting sun burned red the coast of the Liaodong Peninsula, and the sunlight shone on the fish-scale-like waves, emitting a dazzling light. Our ship targeted another fin whale from the diagonal刺里. When it first窜出出sea, Xu Xiyi's cannon arrow hit the whale's back. Although this whale was not as big as the previous two, its strength was not small. It took the炮弹straight to the southwest, which happened to be the direction of our return航. At this time, Lao Zhao, who had just come to learn whaling technology from Shanghai, was操着舵, and said with interest: "Now the engine doesn't need to be turned on, and I don't need to掌舵, let it lead us home!" It was not until the red sun set that two more shots were added to kill the whale. Calculating, she dragged us at sea for two and a half hours, sailing more than twenty nautical miles. At this time, the captain, with a tired but happy mood, turned to the telegraph operator Xiao Kong and said: "Send a telegram home, three fin whales hit today." "Send another telegram to pay tribute to the brother艇 who helped us tow the first two whales. Without their cooperation, "Whaling No. 1" would not have been able to hit three fin whales in one day."

　　After dinner, it was already eleven o'clock at night. In a corner of Haiyang Island harbor in the direction of return航, the lights were brilliant, and the workers at the whale processing plant were processing and剖制 the first two whales. After twelve o'clock, the captain reached out and tore off a page on the calendar in the驾驶室 - April 6, 1959, had passed. This was a memorable day. "Whaling No. 1" continuously caught three fin whales in five hours, weighing about eighty tons, worth more than ninety thousand yuan. The achievements of this day alone enabled them to complete 10% of the annual plan and 40% of the monthly plan. (Attached picture)

### “捕鲸一号”渔轮上的一天

　　“捕鲸一号”渔轮上的一天
　　本报记者　姚世夫
  　黎明的浓雾笼罩着大海，远离大连港七十多海里的海洋岛，隐没在神话和梦幻的世界里。清晨四时，我们乘舢板登上了“捕鲸一号”渔轮。这时，在静静的港湾的怀抱中，突然亮起了红色、白色的灯光，起锚机发出巨响，汽笛一声长鸣。它告诉我们：我国第一条专门捕捉“海上霸王”（长须鲸）的“捕鲸一号”渔轮，启碇出海了。
    “老船长”
    现在是拂晓，船好像在蒸气锅炉中航行，还不能捕鲸。“今天能不能捕到长须鲸？”乘这机会，我迫不及待地向人们尊称为“老船长”的老师傅刘育生提出这个问题。
      “老船长”今年五十七岁了，他是一位饱经海上风霜的老人，他的童年和壮年都是在日本捕鲸船上当杂工。解放不久，他就担任了我国第一条捕鲸船“114号”的船长，也是我国第一个捕鲸炮手。他创造了不少成绩，现在因为身体不好，专门培养新炮手。他告诉我们说：“说来话长，不但你们，我们想逮长须鲸都快想出相思病来了。”
    为什么人们这样想念长须鲸呢？原来，长须鲸属于鲸中较大的一种，一般都有几十吨重，它全身是宝，经济价值很高，仅它的脑下垂体一项，一吨即价值五百万元。但它的游行速度很快，每小时可达十七海里，而且非常机灵。因此，不仅沿海的渔民把它当龙王看待，就连渔轮，也要让它三分。捕鲸，在我国还是一件新事。我国的捕鲸船虽有几条，但只有“捕鲸一号”能够对付得住长须鲸。
    “捕鲸一号”是我国自制的一条渔轮。去年投入试捕生产以来，先后由“老船长”和炮手石沙各打到两条长须鲸，这就是我国用现代化生产工具，最早捕到的四条长须鲸。今年，“捕鲸一号”正式投入了生产。炮手们眼看着长须鲸在海面上吞云吐雾，可是它一听轮机的声响，就狡猾地沉没海底。
    这使石沙和副炮手徐熙义这两个共产党员非常烦恼。
    捉迷藏
    正当我们谈着谈着，突然从驾驶室传来了船长的声音：“发现了鲸鱼。”全体船员在一分钟之内已经各就各位，投入了紧张的战斗。“捕鲸一号”追捕着一条失群的鲸鱼，可是足足追了一个多钟头没有一点结果。突然电报员小孔报告说：船长，504号船来电，32海区发现长须鲸，问我们去不去？”“去！”船长回答说。一个钟头以后，我们的船来到了32海区。不一会一个半圆体的东西在一百公尺开外的船后边出现了。它喷着白色的水柱，露出了桌面大的脊鳍，一会儿沉，一会儿浮，真是一个巨大的怪物。我们的船连忙来了个右转舵，赶上前去，但当我们赶到它游过的地方，这个怪物又沉没海底了。船以全速向鲸鱼前进的方向开去，可是，这家伙却又突然出现在我们的右后方，原来是我们追得太猛，赶过头了。轮机发出急剧的声响，船身在海浪上整整划了一个圆圈，又追过去了。……就这样兜来转去，整整兜了一个半小时，还是没有结果。
    太阳已经升上了高空，了望塔、船头、船顶上的人们，不断报告着这里出现了二条夫妻鲸，那里发现两条母子鲸，许多条水柱在海洋上起伏，出现一片奇妙的景色。鱼群正在追捕着一片黄色的浮游生物，而我们的船也紧跟着鱼群展开了横拦竖截的追捕战。
    追呀追的，我们的船仍然朝着鱼的正前方追去，可是，那鲸鱼却又出现在我们的右前方，而且距离更远。
    第一只猎获物
    上午十时，炮手石沙忽然回过头来，高声征询他的老师刘育生的意见：“老船长，我看这条老实，打这条吧！”“老船长”面露喜色，称赞他的心爱的徒弟有主见：“对，不能乱转，打这条大的。”于是，这位带病工作的“老船长”突然像一个青年，两脚站上楼座的栏杆，顺着石沙的手势，向舵手发出一道道命令：“两个车（即半速）！”“右舵！”“三个车（全速）！”“停！”
    正当我们的船平稳地停在一个面向东南的海面上，一条大、一条小的母子鲸在右前方的射程以外游过，船上有人着急地叫打，“老船长”却沉着指挥：“不要睬它，打这条大的！”就在这一瞬间，一条黯黑色的鲸背隐现在右前方不远处，当它喷起第二个水柱，躯身暴露在我们的炮口前时，“打”“打”“打”！轰的一声，副炮手徐熙义发出第一炮，炮箭上的尼龙绳哗啦啦地投向海里。可是并不见水上翻起浪花，不知打中没有？突然甲板上的工人打开了滑车，尼龙绳紧紧的，大家才不约而同地喊出：“中啦！”“中啦！”渔轮随着绳索牵引的方向，全速前进，不到一刻钟，绳索已经成垂直线向海底下沉。这就说明，这条鱼被击中要害，不能呼吸了。船长老于走出驾驶室，拉一拉绳索的松紧，决定起鱼。甲板上所有的人都脱去了皮外套紧张地工作着，绞车辘辘地转动，绳子越拉越紧，人们的心情也越来越紧张。最后，船的右侧海面上浮起了一个燕尾式的鲸鱼尾巴，在绿色的涟漪下一长条白色闪闪发光，老船长告诉我这就是鱼身。一会儿一条长须鲸浮起来了。好大的家伙！足有十七、八公尺长。船员放下舢板，用一根粗铁丝绕紧了鲸鱼的尾部，又用一根铁链，把鱼尾紧紧地锁在船的右舷。等到风枪扦进了长着长长的“胡子”的鲸腹，通通压缩空气，长须鲸就鼓起了大肚皮，任从我们交给504号兄弟渔轮拖回加工场去了。
    新手——新纪录
    日头过了正午，海面上的风浪已经增强。可是谁也没有管它风大风小，船头又转向32海区。了望塔上大副万家祺和“鱼眼”王吉安报告说：一条长须鲸正在海面下向北游动。很快，这条鲸鱼又被我们的船钉上了。徐熙义紧握炮闩，石沙做着各种手语，大副、船长，老船长交替地传达着各种开车命令：“左舵角！”
  “三个车！”“好！”不等人们眨眼，一条庞然大物已露出水面，和我们的船成人字形，正好投入射程之内。徐熙义又发一炮，炮箭擦过水面，像摩托艇一样掀起一串浪花，窜过鱼身一公尺以外。“糟糕，擦过去了！”不知谁惋惜地说。然而，说也奇怪，尼龙绳不断地放出，还是越拉越紧。“又中啦！”这回是石沙和“老船长”同时发出的欢呼声，他们庆贺这位年轻的新捕鲸炮手创造了一天打两条长须鲸的新纪录。但这个怪物还像野马似地在牵着两根尼龙绳向前奔驰，还不断浮到水面喷出水柱喘气。水柱映着红日，海上出现了一朵五色缤纷的彩虹。徐熙义又沉住气给鲸鱼补了一炮，才结果了它的性命。我看了看表，时间是十二点十分，离打到第一条鱼，还不到两个小时。这时船上人人称赞：“好家伙，老徐去年连打三十多炮，只打中两条小鲸鱼，今天两个钟头，连打两条长须鲸，有本事！”
    捕鲸史上新的一页
    西下的太阳，烧红了辽东半岛的海岸，阳光照在鱼鳞式的波涛上发出耀眼的光芒。我们的船从斜刺里又钉上一条长须鲸，等它第一次窜出海面，徐熙义的炮箭正好打中鲸鱼的脊背。这条鲸鱼，虽然个儿不如前两条，但力气倒也不小，它带着炮弹直向西南逃去，这正好是我们归航的方向。这时，新从上海来这儿学习捕鲸技术的老赵操着舵，饶有风趣地说：现在轮机也不用开了，我也不用掌舵了，让它领我们回家吧！”直到红日西沉，才又补上两炮，打死了这条鲸鱼。计算起来，她整整拖着我们在海上跑了两个半小时，航行了二十多海里。这时，船长带着疲劳而又愉快的心情，转向电报员小孔说：“向家里发报，今天命中长须鲸三条。”“再发电向帮助我们拖带前两条鲸鱼的兄弟艇致敬，没有他们的协作，“捕鲸一号”是不能一天打到三条长须鲸的。”
    吃过晚饭，已经是深夜十一时了，归航方向的海洋岛港湾里的一角，灯火辉煌，鲸鱼加工厂的工人们正在加工剖制前两条鲸鱼。十二点过后，船长在驾驶室里伸手撕去了日历上的一页——1959年4月6日过去了，这是一个值得记忆的日子，“捕鲸一号”在五小时内，连续捕到三条长须鲸，约重八十吨，价值九万余元。仅这一天的成绩，使他们完成了全年计划的10％，全月计划的40％。（附图片）
