Xinhua News Agency, 30th. At the first meeting of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee yesterday, representatives of more than thirty ethnic groups from all over the country spoke out one after another, angrily condemning the Indian expansionists' conspiracy to openly interfere in China's internal affairs, and the shameless acts of insulting the leaders of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Their speeches expressed the determination of the people of all ethnic groups in the country to defend the unification of the motherland, further strengthen the great unity of all ethnic groups, and work together to build a socialist motherland family.

The meeting was presided over by Liu Geping, Chairman of the Nationalities Committee. The meeting first approved the candidates for Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Committee. Based on Liu Geping's nomination, all the committee members present unanimously approved Bao Erhan (Uygur), Kui Bi (Mongolian), Zhang Chong (Yi), Xie Fumin (Zhuang), and Sangji Yexi (Tibetan) as Vice Chairmen of the Second National People's Congress Nationalities Committee.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the National People's Congress and representative of the Central Government in Tibet, was invited to give a speech on the work of Tibet.

Next, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Second National People's Congress Nationalities Committee, spoke, and he indignantly condemned the provocative behavior of Indian expansionist elements interfering in China's internal affairs and insulting our leaders. He said that after the Indian expansionist elements instigated the Tibetan rebellion and failed, they have recently been even more frantically engaged in activities hostile to our country, and even openly insulted our leaders, which cannot but arouse great anger among the people of all ethnic groups in our country.  We do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor do we allow others to interfere in our domestic affairs. Tibet is our territory, and quelling the Tibetan rebellion is our internal affair, and no foreigner has the right to interfere.

He pointed out that the course of history is always contrary to the wishes of the reactionaries. The rebellion instigated by the British imperialists and Indian expansionist elements supporting the Tibetan reactionaries is like lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet. With the help of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the Tibetan people will surely overthrow the serf system as soon as possible and build Tibet into a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

Jiantong·Jijinmei (Tibetan), Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, in his speech, listed many facts to show that the People's Liberation Army and Han Chinese staff implemented the central government's ethnic policies and religious freedom policies in Tibet, did good deeds and sought benefits for the people, and condemned the conspiracy activities of imperialists and Indian expansionist elements to interfere in China's internal affairs. Jijinmei said: Recently, some people in India said that Panchen Lama's speech at the National People's Congress was "unfair." This statement is not surprising, because Panchen Lama was righteous and stern, and thoroughly exposed the entire truth of the conspiracy activities of imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. We Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, believe it to be completely fair.

Xi Raojiacuo (Tibetan), President of the Buddhist Association of China and Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, pointed out in his speech that the conspiracy of Indian expansionist elements to interfere in China's internal affairs has completely failed, and their recent defense of the so-called Dalai Lama's statement is full of lies. Xi Raojiacuo said that the Dalai Lama is a Buddha, but his current situation is very embarrassing. He hopes that the Dalai Lama will get rid of the shackles of the abductors and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Xi Raojiacuo said: I am very familiar with Tibet. The Tibetan reactionary group has always pretended to respect the Dalai Lama on the surface, but in fact this group of wolves with heinous crimes has always been outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient to the Dalai Lama. This is an open secret in Tibet. After the Dalai Lama was kidnapped, of course, he had no power at all. The three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan are the Dalai Lama's own expression of his true attitude. Any lies made by Indian interferers are futile.

Bangda Duoji (Tibetan), Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, pointed out in his speech that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and no documents in Tibet can be found to support the claim that Tibet is a "independent country." The so-called "Tibetan independence" is entirely fabricated by Tibetan traitors supported by imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. We express great indignation at the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group who betrayed the motherland and the Indian expansionist elements.

Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Vice Governor of Gansu Province, pointed out in his speech that the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion enabled the Tibetan people to begin to break away from the shackles of feudal reactionary forces and move towards a new life. This is a great victory for the party's ethnic policy and a great victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the country. With the help of the people of all ethnic groups, Tibet's social reform will be smoothly realized, the day when the Tibetan people will be masters of their own affairs is coming, and the long-term impoverished and backward life will be ended forever.

Temuerbagen (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, said: Under the instigation of British imperialist and Indian expansionist elements, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group betrayed the motherland and slaughtered the people, arousing the indignation of the people throughout the country. The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, like the people of the whole country, have solemnly condemned this small group of traitors. He said: The people of all ethnic groups in China have established a close cooperative brotherly relationship in the long revolutionary struggle, and deeply know that the people of all ethnic groups must strengthen national unity under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the unified family of the motherland, in order to change the backward state left over by history and achieve development and prosperity. The path taken by all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia is a powerful proof.

Zakelov (Uygur), Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that our people across the country are going all out and striving for the top, striding forward towards socialism. Only under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we carry out the magnificent cause unprecedented in history. He said that imperialists and foreign reactionaries are very hostile to our achievements, and use all kinds of despicable and shameless means to desperately obstruct and sabotage us, but any of their despicable conspiracies are doomed to failure.

Zhao Lequn (Zhuang), Deputy Director of the Zhuang Language Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Congress, pointed out in his speech: Some politicians and reactionary newspapers in India openly support the Tibetan traitors who killed, set fires, and exterminated humanity, and launched vicious attacks on our country, which we cannot tolerate. We warn Indian expansionist elements that no matter what tricks you play or what conspiracies you engage in, you will never get good results!

Ma Yuhuai (Hui), Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, angrily condemned the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group for killing Tibetan patriots, using temples as command centers for the rebellion, burning the Islamic mosques in Lhasa, and kidnapping the Dalai Lama to escape to India, etc. activities.

He pointed out: Indian expansionist elements openly support the Tibetan rebels with heinous crimes, interfere in our internal affairs, and even insult the great leaders of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. This is an insult to the 650 million people of our country, which we cannot tolerate.

Xia Ke Daodeng (Tibetan), Deputy Governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan, expressed great indignation at the activities of imperialists and foreign interferers to sabotage China's unity and ethnic unity. He said: The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has completed social reforms and has achieved great achievements in all aspects. We will fully support the Tibetan people to liberate themselves from the oppression of the serf system and build a happy and prosperous new Tibet.

Guo Ji Mugu, Deputy Governor of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, said that the Yi people have deeply realized from the bitter history before liberation and the happy life of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups after liberation: The unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups are our lives. The Yi people, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, resolutely defend the unity of the motherland and will never allow others to undermine it.

The members who spoke or made written speeches at the meeting also included: Yang Hanxian (Miao), Wu Yingkai (Manchu), Anniwar Jakulin (Kazakh), Su Xin (Qiang), Chen Jiyi (Dong), Wei Maowen (Buyi), Meng Sufen (Buyi), Zhao Shitong (Zhuang), Yang Wengui (Miao), Huaergong Chenglie (Tibetan), Lei Chunguo (Jingpo), Fu Yizhi (Lisu), Li Guanghua (Lahu), Pu Guizhong (Yi), Li Kairong (Yao), He Fengzhao (Naxi), Tian Fuda (Gaoshan), Anniwar Hanbaba (Uzbek), Gara Zang (Mongolian), Ma Qingnian (Hui), Ma Yong (Dongxiang), Wang Meigong (Hui), and Jin Xinshu (Korean). In their speeches, they unanimously supported the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion, and used concrete facts and personal experiences to show that ethnic minorities can only develop and prosper under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the united family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. In their speeches, the members warmly congratulated the Tibetan people for embarking on the bright and happy road of democracy and socialism.

    三十多个民族的代表表达一个坚强的意志
    决心加强团结捍卫祖国统一
    人大民族委员会第一次会议痛斥印度扩张主义者
    新华社30日讯　昨天在第二届全国人民代表大会民族委员会举行的第一次会议上，来自祖国各地的三十多个民族的委员们纷纷发言，愤怒谴责印度扩张主义者公开干涉我国内政的阴谋活动，和侮辱我国各民族人民领袖的无耻行径。他们的发言，表达了全国各族人民捍卫祖国统一、进一步加强各族大团结和协力建设社会主义祖国大家庭的决心。
    会议由民族委员会主任委员刘格平主持。会议首先通过民族委员会副主任委员的人选。根据刘格平的提名，到会全体委员一致通过包尔汉（维吾尔族）、奎璧（蒙古族）、张冲（彝族）、谢扶民（僮族）、桑吉悦希（藏族）等五人为第二届全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员。
    全国人民代表大会代表、中央驻西藏代表张经武应邀在会上作了关于西藏工作问题的讲话。
    接着，第二届人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员包尔汉发言，他愤慨地谴责印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政、侮辱我国领袖的挑衅行为。他说，印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱失败之后，最近更疯狂地进行敌视我国的活动，甚至公然侮辱我国领袖，这不能不引起我国各族人民极大愤怒。我们不干涉别国的内政，也不允许别人干涉我国内政。西藏是我国的领土，平息西藏叛乱是我国的内政，任何外国人无权过问。
    他指出，历史的进程总是与反动派的愿望相反，英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持西藏反动派策动的叛乱活动，正是自己搬起石头打自己的脚。西藏人民在全国各族人民帮助下，一定会早日推翻农奴制度，把西藏建设成为繁荣幸福的新西藏。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员詹东·计晋美（藏族）在发言中，列举许多事实，说明人民解放军和汉族工作人员在西藏贯彻执行了中央的民族政策和宗教信仰自由政策，为人民办好事、谋福利，谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的阴谋活动。计晋美说：最近印度有人说班禅大师在全国人民代表大会上的发言是“不公正的”，这种说法并不奇怪，因为班禅大师义正词严，彻底揭穿了帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子阴谋活动的全部真象，我们西藏人民和全国各族人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，都认为是完全公正的。
    中国佛教协会会长、青海省副省长喜饶嘉错（藏族）在发言中指出，印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的阴谋已经彻底破产，他们最近对所谓达赖喇嘛声明的许多辩护，是谎话成堆。喜饶嘉错说，达赖喇嘛是佛，但是现在的处境是十分难堪的，希望达赖喇嘛摆脱劫持者的束缚，回到祖国的怀抱。
    喜饶嘉错说：我很熟悉西藏，西藏上层反动集团一贯在表面上假装很尊敬达赖喇嘛，而实际上这群罪大无边的豺狼，一贯在达赖喇嘛面前阳奉阴违，这样的事在西藏是个公开的秘密。达赖喇嘛被劫持以后，当然更是毫无权力。达赖喇嘛亲笔写给谭冠三将军的三封信，才是达赖喇嘛自己表明了真正的态度，印度干涉者制造任何谎言都是枉然的。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员邦达多吉（藏族）在发言中指出，西藏从来就是中国领土不可分割的部分，在西藏的任何文件上都找不出西藏是一个什么“独立国家”的根据。所谓“西藏独立”完全是帝国主义、印度扩张主义分子所支持着的西藏叛国分子的捏造。我们对背叛祖国的西藏上层反动集团和印度扩张主义分子表示极大的愤慨。
    甘肃省副省长黄正清（藏族）在发言中指出，西藏叛乱的迅速平息，使西藏人民开始摆脱封建反动势力的枷锁，走向新生。这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利，是全国各族人民的伟大胜利。在各族人民的帮助下，西藏社会改革将会顺利实现，西藏人民当家作主的日子就要到来，长期贫困落后的痛苦生活将永远结束。
    内蒙古自治区政协副主席特木尔巴根（蒙族）在发言中说：西藏上层反动集团在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的策动下，背叛祖国，残杀人民，激起了全国人民的愤慨。内蒙古各族人民和全国人民一样，对这一小撮叛国分子进行了严正的声讨。他说：中国各民族人民在长期的革命斗争中，建立起了亲密合作的兄弟关系，深深知道，各族人民必须在中国共产党领导下，在祖国统一大家庭中，加强民族团结，才能改变历史上遗留下来的落后状态，得到发展繁荣。内蒙古各民族所走的道路，就是一个有力的证明。
    新疆维吾尔自治区副主席扎克洛夫（维吾尔族）说，我们全国人民正在鼓足干劲、力争上游，向着社会主义大踏步迈进。只有在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们才能进行千古未有的宏伟的事业。他说，帝国主义和外国反动派非常仇视我们的成就，并且用种种卑鄙无耻的手段，拼命进行阻挠和破坏，但是它们任何卑鄙的阴谋都是注定要失败的。
    广西僮族自治区人民代表会议僮文委员会副主任赵乐群（僮族）在发言中指出：印度的某些政治家和反动报刊公开支持杀人放火、灭绝人性的西藏叛国分子，向我国进行恶毒攻击，这是我们不能容忍的。我们警告印度扩张主义分子，不论你们耍什么花招，搞什么阴谋诡计，是绝对得不到好结果的！
    宁夏回族自治区副主席马玉槐（回）愤慨地谴责了原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团杀害西藏爱国人士，以寺庙作为叛乱的指挥中心，烧毁拉萨伊斯兰教的清真寺，劫持达赖喇嘛逃往印度等等罪恶活动。
    他指出：印度扩张主义分子竟然公开支持罪大恶极的西藏叛乱分子，干涉我国内政，甚至侮辱我国各民族人民的伟大领袖。这是对我国六亿五千万人民的侮辱，这是我们无法容忍的。
    四川甘孜藏族自治州副州长夏克刀登（藏族）对帝国主义和外国干涉者阴谋破坏我国统一和民族团结的活动，表示了极大愤慨。他说：甘孜藏族自治州已经完成了社会改革，在各方面都取得了很大成就。我们将全力支援西藏人民从农奴制度的压迫下解放出来，建设幸福繁荣的新西藏。
    凉山彝族自治州副州长果基木古说，彝族人民从解放前苦难的历史，和解放后各民族友爱团结的幸福生活中，深深体会到：祖国的统一和各民族的团结就是我们的生命。彝族人民同全国各族人民一道，坚决保卫祖国的团结统一，绝不容许别人来破坏。
    在会议上发言或作书面发言的，还有：杨汉先（苗族）、吴英恺（满族）、安尼瓦尔·贾库林（哈萨克族）、苏新（羌族）、陈基义（侗族）、韦茂文（布依族）、蒙素芬（布依族）、赵世同（僮族）、杨文贵
  （苗族）华尔功成烈（藏族）、雷春国（景颇族）、付一之（傈僳族）、李光华（拉祜族）、普贵忠（彝族）、李开荣（瑶族）、和风昭（纳西族）、田富达（高山族）、安尼瓦尔·汗巴巴（乌孜别克族）、噶喇藏（蒙古族）、马青年（回族）、马泳（东乡族）、王美恭（回族）、金信淑（朝鲜族）等委员。他们在发言中一致拥护国务院关于平息西藏叛乱的命令，并且用具体事实和亲身体会，说明少数民族只有在共产党领导下，在祖国各民族团结的大家庭中，才能发展繁荣；委员们在发言中，热烈祝贺西藏人民开始走上了民主和社会主义的光明幸福大道。
