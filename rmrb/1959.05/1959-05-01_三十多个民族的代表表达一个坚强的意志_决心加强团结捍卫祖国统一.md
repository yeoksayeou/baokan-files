Xinhua News Agency, 30th. At the first meeting of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee yesterday, representatives of more than thirty ethnic groups from all over the country spoke out one after another, angrily condemning the Indian expansionists' conspiracy to openly interfere in China's internal affairs, and the shameless acts of insulting the leaders of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Their speeches expressed the determination of the people of all ethnic groups in the country to defend the unification of the motherland, further strengthen the great unity of all ethnic groups, and work together to build a socialist motherland family.

The meeting was presided over by Liu Geping, Chairman of the Nationalities Committee. The meeting first approved the candidates for Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Committee. Based on Liu Geping's nomination, all the committee members present unanimously approved Bao Erhan (Uygur), Kui Bi (Mongolian), Zhang Chong (Yi), Xie Fumin (Zhuang), and Sangji Yexi (Tibetan) as Vice Chairmen of the Second National People's Congress Nationalities Committee.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the National People's Congress and representative of the Central Government in Tibet, was invited to give a speech on the work of Tibet.

Next, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Second National People's Congress Nationalities Committee, spoke, and he indignantly condemned the provocative behavior of Indian expansionist elements interfering in China's internal affairs and insulting our leaders. He said that after the Indian expansionist elements instigated the Tibetan rebellion and failed, they have recently been even more frantically engaged in activities hostile to our country, and even openly insulted our leaders, which cannot but arouse great anger among the people of all ethnic groups in our country.  We do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor do we allow others to interfere in our domestic affairs. Tibet is our territory, and quelling the Tibetan rebellion is our internal affair, and no foreigner has the right to interfere.

He pointed out that the course of history is always contrary to the wishes of the reactionaries. The rebellion instigated by the British imperialists and Indian expansionist elements supporting the Tibetan reactionaries is like lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet. With the help of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the Tibetan people will surely overthrow the serf system as soon as possible and build Tibet into a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

JiantongÂ·Jijinmei (Tibetan), Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, in his speech, listed many facts to show that the People's Liberation Army and Han Chinese staff implemented the central government's ethnic policies and religious freedom policies in Tibet, did good deeds and sought benefits for the people, and condemned the conspiracy activities of imperialists and Indian expansionist elements to interfere in China's internal affairs. Jijinmei said: Recently, some people in India said that Panchen Lama's speech at the National People's Congress was "unfair." This statement is not surprising, because Panchen Lama was righteous and stern, and thoroughly exposed the entire truth of the conspiracy activities of imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. We Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, believe it to be completely fair.

Xi Raojiacuo (Tibetan), President of the Buddhist Association of China and Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, pointed out in his speech that the conspiracy of Indian expansionist elements to interfere in China's internal affairs has completely failed, and their recent defense of the so-called Dalai Lama's statement is full of lies. Xi Raojiacuo said that the Dalai Lama is a Buddha, but his current situation is very embarrassing. He hopes that the Dalai Lama will get rid of the shackles of the abductors and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Xi Raojiacuo said: I am very familiar with Tibet. The Tibetan reactionary group has always pretended to respect the Dalai Lama on the surface, but in fact this group of wolves with heinous crimes has always been outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient to the Dalai Lama. This is an open secret in Tibet. After the Dalai Lama was kidnapped, of course, he had no power at all. The three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan are the Dalai Lama's own expression of his true attitude. Any lies made by Indian interferers are futile.

Bangda Duoji (Tibetan), Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, pointed out in his speech that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and no documents in Tibet can be found to support the claim that Tibet is a "independent country." The so-called "Tibetan independence" is entirely fabricated by Tibetan traitors supported by imperialists and Indian expansionist elements. We express great indignation at the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group who betrayed the motherland and the Indian expansionist elements.

Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), Vice Governor of Gansu Province, pointed out in his speech that the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion enabled the Tibetan people to begin to break away from the shackles of feudal reactionary forces and move towards a new life. This is a great victory for the party's ethnic policy and a great victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the country. With the help of the people of all ethnic groups, Tibet's social reform will be smoothly realized, the day when the Tibetan people will be masters of their own affairs is coming, and the long-term impoverished and backward life will be ended forever.

Temuerbagen (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, said: Under the instigation of British imperialist and Indian expansionist elements, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group betrayed the motherland and slaughtered the people, arousing the indignation of the people throughout the country. The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, like the people of the whole country, have solemnly condemned this small group of traitors. He said: The people of all ethnic groups in China have established a close cooperative brotherly relationship in the long revolutionary struggle, and deeply know that the people of all ethnic groups must strengthen national unity under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the unified family of the motherland, in order to change the backward state left over by history and achieve development and prosperity. The path taken by all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia is a powerful proof.

Zakelov (Uygur), Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said that our people across the country are going all out and striving for the top, striding forward towards socialism. Only under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we carry out the magnificent cause unprecedented in history. He said that imperialists and foreign reactionaries are very hostile to our achievements, and use all kinds of despicable and shameless means to desperately obstruct and sabotage us, but any of their despicable conspiracies are doomed to failure.

Zhao Lequn (Zhuang), Deputy Director of the Zhuang Language Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Congress, pointed out in his speech: Some politicians and reactionary newspapers in India openly support the Tibetan traitors who killed, set fires, and exterminated humanity, and launched vicious attacks on our country, which we cannot tolerate. We warn Indian expansionist elements that no matter what tricks you play or what conspiracies you engage in, you will never get good results!

Ma Yuhuai (Hui), Vice Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, angrily condemned the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group for killing Tibetan patriots, using temples as command centers for the rebellion, burning the Islamic mosques in Lhasa, and kidnapping the Dalai Lama to escape to India, etc. activities.

He pointed out: Indian expansionist elements openly support the Tibetan rebels with heinous crimes, interfere in our internal affairs, and even insult the great leaders of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. This is an insult to the 650 million people of our country, which we cannot tolerate.

Xia Ke Daodeng (Tibetan), Deputy Governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan, expressed great indignation at the activities of imperialists and foreign interferers to sabotage China's unity and ethnic unity. He said: The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has completed social reforms and has achieved great achievements in all aspects. We will fully support the Tibetan people to liberate themselves from the oppression of the serf system and build a happy and prosperous new Tibet.

Guo Ji Mugu, Deputy Governor of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, said that the Yi people have deeply realized from the bitter history before liberation and the happy life of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups after liberation: The unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups are our lives. The Yi people, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, resolutely defend the unity of the motherland and will never allow others to undermine it.

The members who spoke or made written speeches at the meeting also included: Yang Hanxian (Miao), Wu Yingkai (Manchu), Anniwar Jakulin (Kazakh), Su Xin (Qiang), Chen Jiyi (Dong), Wei Maowen (Buyi), Meng Sufen (Buyi), Zhao Shitong (Zhuang), Yang Wengui (Miao), Huaergong Chenglie (Tibetan), Lei Chunguo (Jingpo), Fu Yizhi (Lisu), Li Guanghua (Lahu), Pu Guizhong (Yi), Li Kairong (Yao), He Fengzhao (Naxi), Tian Fuda (Gaoshan), Anniwar Hanbaba (Uzbek), Gara Zang (Mongolian), Ma Qingnian (Hui), Ma Yong (Dongxiang), Wang Meigong (Hui), and Jin Xinshu (Korean). In their speeches, they unanimously supported the State Council's order to quell the Tibetan rebellion, and used concrete facts and personal experiences to show that ethnic minorities can only develop and prosper under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the united family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. In their speeches, the members warmly congratulated the Tibetan people for embarking on the bright and happy road of democracy and socialism.
