This year, on both the industrial and agricultural fronts, many places have taken improving labor productivity as an important goal. This is a distinct characteristic of this year's increase production and practice economy campaign.

Improving labor productivity is a slogan that comprehensively embodies the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Taking improving labor productivity as an important goal has significant practical implications for effectively carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign and realizing this year's great leap forward. What is improving labor productivity? Simply put, it is producing more products with the same labor consumption. We know that labor consumption in product production includes two parts: living labor and materialized labor. Living labor is the labor directly consumed in the production process of a certain product. Materialized labor is the value created by past labor consumed when producing a certain product, such as the consumption of raw materials, materials, and fuel, and the depreciation of machines and factories. Improving labor productivity means saving both living labor and materialized labor for the entire society. This saving is the source of increasing socialist accumulation and expanding social reproduction. Our country's national economic plan for this year is a plan for a continued great leap forward, and the living labor and materialized labor required to realize this plan will also be much greater than last year. Therefore, carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign and striving to improve labor productivity, and saving the consumption of living labor and materialized labor, is of great significance for realizing this year's great leap forward.

Some comrades do not understand or do not fully understand the significance of this. They regard improving labor productivity as an additional task outside of production, thinking that "as long as production leaps forward, why bother with labor productivity?" These comrades do not understand that it is difficult to continue the great leap forward without improving labor productivity. This is a new situation in the development of the great leap forward today. Whether it is the great leap forward in industry or the great leap forward in agriculture, the first thing is to have people, to have labor. Our country has a population of over 600 million, including over 300 million laborers and semi-laborers, making it the country with the richest labor resources in the world. However, after nearly ten years of economic recovery and economic construction, especially after last year's great leap forward, all people in society with labor capacity have basically participated in labor within their capabilities, and the phenomenon of social unemployment has been eliminated. This is an extremely great achievement in our country's history. However, this new situation has also brought new problems: a shortage of labor. This is the case on the industrial front, and it is also the case on the agricultural front. In this case, if the labor force cannot be increased, and labor productivity is not improved, how can the great leap forward be continued? In order to continue the great leap forward, we can only strive to improve labor productivity; if, through the improvement of technology, the reform of labor organization, the improvement of production management, and the development of labor enthusiasm and creativity, labor productivity is greatly improved, then the labor results of one person will actually be equal to one and a half persons, or equal to two persons, or even several persons, and the labor results of everyone in one day will be equal to one and a half days, two days, or even several days. If our country's more than 300 million laborers and semi-laborers all work hard in this way, then every 1% increase in labor productivity is equivalent to an increase of 3 million laborers and semi-laborers. What a great potential this is!

However, it would be wrong to think that improving labor productivity is only to solve the shortage of labor. Lenin said long ago: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and the principal condition for the victory of the new social system." Throughout the entire history of human society, the improvement of labor productivity has played an extremely important role. The replacement of slave society by feudal society and the replacement of feudal society by capitalist society were all because the former could show much higher labor productivity than the latter. Socialism will surely defeat capitalism, also because socialism can create much higher labor productivity than capitalism. As for communism, Lenin also pointed out long ago: "Communism is labor productivity that is higher than that of capitalism, created by conscious, voluntary, united workers using advanced technology." It can be seen that improving labor productivity is not only an effective measure to solve the shortage of labor, but also a long-term strategic task for defeating capitalism, building socialism, and building communism in the future. This is particularly important for our country. Our country is "poor and blank." We have rich resources and a diligent and intelligent population of over 600 million. Why are we still "poor and blank"? Why does a country with the richest labor resources in the world still feel a shortage of labor? In the final analysis, it is because the level of social productive forces in our country is still very low, and labor productivity is still very low. Other countries only need to use a small part of their population to engage in agriculture to supply the food and other agricultural products needed by the entire country's population, while our agricultural population accounts for more than 80% of the total population; the industrial products that other countries produce with a few hours of labor, we need to use dozens of hours of labor to produce. As a result, although our people have paid hard labor, social products are still not abundant, and the output of various major industrial and agricultural products, calculated per capita, is still very small compared with many countries. Of course, this is not the fault of our country and our people, but the evil consequences caused by the aggression of imperialism and the reactionary rule of the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie and the landlord class before liberation. In the past ten years, our country and our people have made unremitting struggles to improve labor productivity and have achieved great achievements. In these ten years, labor productivity in our country has already greatly increased. However, due to historical reasons, the level that labor productivity in our country has reached is still very low, and our social products are still far from meeting our needs. To fundamentally change this situation of "poverty and blankness," we must continuously improve labor productivity, so that we can exchange the richest labor fruits with the least amount of labor time, and make social products increasingly rich, so as to meet the needs of the constantly developing national construction and people's lives.

The fundamental way to improve labor productivity is to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and gradually equip all departments of the national economy with new technologies. In order to equip all departments of the national economy with new technologies, it is necessary to realize the industrialization of the country and the mechanization of agriculture, and transfer all departments of the national economy to the foundation of large-scale production. This is our long-term goal. To achieve this long-term goal, we need to be down-to-earth and seize any effective reform in daily production. At present, in the industrial field, we should focus on the reform of technology, the reform of equipment, the reform of product design, the saving and substitution of raw materials, and the manufacture of new raw materials. In particular, in those departments that consume a lot of labor and have a large proportion of manual labor, we should pay more attention to gradually replacing manual operations with semi-mechanized and mechanized operations from indigenous methods to foreign methods. In agriculture, the current focus is on tool reform, which has an immediate effect on improving labor productivity. In order to carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, it is necessary to conscientiously organize laborers to study culture and technology, and constantly improve the cultural level and scientific and technological level of laborers. Especially in the industrial sector, 8 million new workers were absorbed last year. They are very enthusiastic and energetic, but they are generally just beginning to learn the operating skills of industrial production, and their labor efficiency is very low. Strengthening the training and education of new workers and improving their proficiency in technical operations can significantly improve labor productivity.

Improving production organization and labor organization, eliminating waste in the use of labor, and enabling everyone to give full play to their role are also important ways to improve labor productivity. This is especially important in industry. The production of industrial enterprises is closely linked from top to bottom and from left to right. If the production is not well organized and the processes are not coordinated, it will cause waste of working hours. Unreasonable labor organization, excessive non-production personnel, or uneven busy and idle production personnel, resulting in idle work and waste, will also affect the improvement of labor productivity. Therefore, we must continuously improve production organization and labor organization, and strive to improve the management level of enterprises. In recent years, we have gained a lot of experience in improving the production organization and labor organization of enterprises, and our enterprise management level has been greatly improved. However, production organization and labor organization cannot be immutable. With the development of production, the improvement of technology, and the change of tasks, production organization and labor organization need to continue to be adjusted accordingly in order to maximize the labor efficiency of each person. Especially in some small and medium-sized enterprises that were rapidly established in last year's great leap forward, they lack relatively complete management experience, and there are many unreasonable aspects in production organization and labor organization. In these enterprises, the potential for improving labor productivity is even greater.

The road to improving labor productivity is very broad, and it is impossible to describe it in detail here. However, of all the things that can be said, the enthusiasm and creativity of laborers is the most important thing. In order to improve labor productivity, we must give full play to the subjective initiative of laborers and create higher labor efficiency through technical and production organization improvements. What do we rely on to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of laborers? The most important thing is to "put politics in command" and rely on the improvement of the communist consciousness of laborers. Whoever ignores "putting politics in command" will not be able to organize the enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, we must correctly implement the principle of distribution according to labor, so that laborers can care about the improvement of labor productivity from the perspective of material interests.

Improving labor productivity is both an urgent task and a long-term plan. Party organizations at all levels must strengthen their political and ideological leadership and organizational leadership over this work, and regard it as the main content of leading the increase production and practice economy campaign. Although labor productivity is an economic indicator that best embodies the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, like any economic indicator, it is not isolated. If the labor productivity indicator is isolated and regarded as the only important indicator, then various one-sided errors may occur. For example: willing to produce products with a large output value, unwilling to produce products with a small output value; willing to produce old products that they are familiar with and consume less working hours, unwilling to produce new products that they are not familiar with and consume more working hours; willing to produce main engines, unwilling to produce accessories and parts. It may even lead to the phenomenon of pursuing output value at the cost of reducing quality. Not producing according to the state's product variety plan, disregarding quality requirements, and one-sidedly pursuing output value and output, which on the surface seems to increase output value and thus improve labor productivity; but the products produced are not what the state plan needs, the quality is not good, and the lifespan is not long, which can only increase the waste of social labor and cannot truly improve social labor productivity. The significance of improving the labor productivity of a production unit or an industrial sector lies in the fact that it is conducive to the improvement of social labor productivity. If the improvement of the labor productivity of a production unit or an industrial sector is not conducive to the improvement of social labor productivity, but is detrimental to the improvement of social labor productivity, then what is the significance of this? Therefore, in improving labor productivity, we must pay great attention to strengthening political and ideological leadership, and educate our cadres and the masses to treat improving labor productivity from the overall perspective of society, and not just from the local perspective of their own units.

We believe that in this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, through the hard work, practical work, and clever work of the people across the country, labor productivity in our country will surely have a greater increase, and our national economic plan will surely be completed and overfulfilled!

    论提高劳动生产率
  今年来，在工业战线上和农业战线上，许多地方都把提高劳动生产率当作重要的奋斗目标。这是今年增产节约运动的一个鲜明的特点。
    提高劳动生产率，是一个全面体现多快好省方针的口号。把提高劳动生产率当作重要的奋斗目标，对于有效地开展增产节约运动，实现今年的大跃进，有着重要的现实意义。什么是提高劳动生产率呢？简单地说，就是以同样的劳动消耗，生产出更多的产品。我们知道，产品生产中的劳动消耗，包括活劳动和物化劳动两部分。活劳动就是直接消耗在某一种产品生产过程中的劳动。物化劳动是生产某一种产品时所消耗的过去的劳动创造的价值，如原料、材料、燃料的消耗，机器、厂房的折旧等等。劳动生产率的提高，意味着整个社会活劳动和物化劳动的节约。这种节约，是增加社会主义积累，扩大社会再生产的源泉。我国今年的国民经济计划，是一个继续大跃进的计划，实现这个计划所需要的活劳动和物化劳动将也比去年大得多。因此，开展增产节约运动，努力提高劳动生产率，节约活劳动和物化劳动的消耗，对实现今年大跃进就有重大的意义。
    有些同志不了解或者不完全了解这方面的意义。他们把提高劳动生产率当作生产以外的一个附加任务，认为“只要生产跃进就行了，何必去搞什么劳动生产率呢？”这些同志不了解，不提高劳动生产率，就很难继续大跃进。这是大跃进发展到今天的一个新的情况。不管是工业的大跃进，还是农业的大跃进，首先要有人，要有劳动力。我们的国家有六亿多人口，其中有三亿多劳动力和半劳动力，是世界上劳动力资源最富裕的国家。但是，经过近十年的经济恢复和经济建设，特别是经过去年的大跃进，社会上一切有劳动能力的人基本上都参加了力所能及的劳动，社会失业现象消灭了。这是我国历史上一个极其伟大的成就。但是，这个新的情况也带来了新的问题：劳动力不足。这在工业战线上是如此，在农业战线上也是如此。在这种情况下，劳动力既不能增加，又不提高劳动生产率，怎么能继续大跃进呢？为了继续大跃进，就只有努力提高劳动生产率；如果经过技术的提高、劳动组织的改革、生产管理的改进和劳动积极性创造性的发挥，大大提高了劳动生产率，那么，一个人的劳动成果实际上就会等于一个半人，或者等于两个人、甚至好几个人，大家一天劳动的成果也就会等于一天半、两天、甚至好几天。我国的三亿多劳动力和半劳动力，如果都这样努力，那么，劳动生产率每提高1％，就等于增加了三百万个劳动力和半劳动力，这是多么大的潜力啊！
    然而，如果以为提高劳动生产率只是为了解决劳动力的不足，那也是不对的。列宁早就说过：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”在人类社会的全部历史中，劳动生产率的提高起着极其重要的作用。封建社会代替奴隶社会，资本主义社会代替封建社会，都是因为前者能够显示比后者高得多的劳动生产率。社会主义一定战胜资本主义，也是因为社会主义能够造成比资本主义高得多的劳动生产率。至于共产主义，列宁也早已指出：“共产主义就是利用先进技术的、自觉自愿的、联合起来的工人所创造出来的比资本主义高得多的劳动生产率。”可见，提高劳动生产率不只是解决劳动力不足的有效措施，而且是一个战胜资本主义、建成社会主义和将来建设共产主义的长时期的战略任务。对于我们的国家说来，这一点特别重要。我们的国家“一穷二白”。我们有富饶的资源，有六亿多勤劳智慧的人民，为什么还“一穷二白”呢？为什么一个世界上劳动力资源最富裕的国家还感到劳动力不足呢？归根到底，就是因为我们国家社会生产力的水平还很低，劳动生产率还很低。别的国家只需用小部分人口从事农业，就足以供应全国人口所需要的粮食和其他农产品，我们的农业人口却占人口总数的80％以上；别的国家用几个小时的劳动生产出来的工业产品，我们要用几十个小时的劳动才能生产出来。其结果就是，我们的人民虽然付出了辛勤的劳动，但社会产品仍不丰富，各种工农业主要产品的产量，按人口平均计算，同许多国家比较起来，还是非常少的。这当然不是我们的国家和人民的过错，这是解放以前帝国主义的侵略和官僚资产阶级、地主阶级反动统治所造成的恶果。十年来，我们的国家和人民为提高劳动生产率作了不懈的斗争，取得了很大的成就。这十年中，我国的劳动生产率已经有了很大的增长。但是，由于历史的原因，我国劳动生产率已经达到的水平还是很低的，我们的社会产品比起我们的需要来还差得很多。要根本改变这种“一穷二白”的状况，就必须不断提高劳动生产率，使我们能够用最少的劳动时间换取最丰富的劳动果实，使社会产品日益丰富，能满足不断发展的国家建设和人民生活的需要。
    提高劳动生产率的根本途径，在于大搞技术革新和技术革命，逐步用新的技术武装起国民经济的各个部门。为了用新的技术去装备国民经济各个部门，就必须实现国家的工业化和农业机械化，把国民经济各个部门都转移到大生产的基础上去。这是我们的远大目标。实现这个远大的目标，需要我们脚踏实地，抓紧日常生产中任何一项有效的改革。目前，在工业方面应该抓紧工艺方面的改革、设备方面的改革、产品设计方面的改革、原材料的节约代用和新的原料的制造，特别是在那些大量消耗劳动力的、手工劳动比重很大的部门，更要注意由土到洋，逐步用半机械化和机械化操作来代替手工操作。在农业方面，目前主要是搞工具改革，这对于提高劳动生产率都有立竿见影的功效。为了开展技术革新和技术革命，就要认真组织劳动者学习文化和学习技术，不断地提高劳动者的文化水平和科学技术水平。特别是工业方面，去年吸收了八百万新工人，他们热情很高，干劲很大，但一般都是刚开始学习工业生产的操作技术，劳动效率很低。加强新工人的培养教育工作，提高他们的技术操作的熟练程度，就可以显著地提高劳动生产率。
    改进生产组织和劳动组织，杜绝劳动力使用中的浪费现象，使每一个人都能充分发挥作用，也是提高劳动生产率的重要途径。这在工业方面特别重要。工业企业的生产，上下左右，一环紧扣一环，生产组织得不好，工序之间不协调，就会造成工时的浪费。劳动组织不合理，非生产人员过多，或者是生产人员中忙闲不均，产生窝工浪费也会影响劳动生产率的提高。因此，我们要不断地改进生产组织和劳动组织，努力提高企业的管理水平。几年来，我们在改进企业的生产组织和劳动组织方面，取得了很多经验，我们的企业管理水平有了很大的提高。但是，生产组织和劳动组织不可能是一成不变的。随着生产的发展，技术的提高，任务的变更，生产组织和劳动组织都需要继续作相应的调整，才能发挥每一个人的最大的劳动效率。特别是在去年大跃进中迅速建立起来的一些中小型企业，缺乏比较完整的管理经验，生产组织和劳动组织有许多不合理的地方，在这些企业中，提高劳动生产率的潜力就更大。
    提高劳动生产率的道路是非常广阔的，这里不可能一一详述。但是，千条万条，劳动者的积极性和创造性是第一条。为了提高劳动生产率，就要充分发挥劳动者的主观能动性，通过技术上的和生产组织上的改进，来创造更高的劳动效率。劳动者的积极性和创造性靠什么来发动呢？最主要的，是靠“政治挂帅”，靠劳动者共产主义觉悟的提高。谁要是忽视“政治挂帅”，就不可能把群众的积极性组织起来。与此同时，还要正确贯彻按劳分配的原则，使劳动者从物质利益方面来关心劳动生产率的提高。
    提高劳动生产率既是当务之急，又是长远之计。各级党的组织必须加强对这项工作的政治思想领导和组织领导，把它当作领导增产节约运动的主要内容。劳动生产率虽然是一项最能体现多快好省的方针的经济指标，但是，同任何经济指标一样，它也不是孤立的。如果把劳动生产率的指标孤立起来，把它当作是唯一重要的指标，那么，就可能产生种种片面性的错误。例如：愿意生产产值大的产品，不愿意生产产值小的产品；愿意生产自己熟悉的、工时消耗比较少的老产品，不愿意生产自己不熟悉的、工时消耗比较多的新产品；愿意生产主机，不愿意生产配件、零件。甚至还可能产生以降低质量作代价去追求产值的现象。不按照国家产品品种计划生产，不顾质量的要求，片面地追求产值、产量，表面上看起来也增加了产值，因而提高了劳动生产率；但是生产出来的产品不是国家计划所需要的，质量不好，寿命不长，只能增加社会劳动的浪费，并不能真正提高社会劳动生产率。一个生产单位、一个产业部门的劳动生产率提高的意义，就在于它有利于社会劳动生产率的提高，
  如果一个生产单位、一个产业部门的劳动生产率的提高，不是有利于社会劳动生产率的提高，而是不利于社会劳动生产率的提高，这又有什么意义呢？因此，在提高劳动生产率中一定要十分注意加强政治思想领导，教育我们的干部和群众从社会的全局观点，而不是只从本单位的局部观点来对待提高劳动生产率。
    我们相信，在今年的增产节约运动中，经过全国人民苦干、实干、巧干，我国的劳动生产率一定会有更大的增长，我们的国民经济计划一定能完成和超额完成！
