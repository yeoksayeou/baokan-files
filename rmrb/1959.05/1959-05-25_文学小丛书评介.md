The People's Literature Publishing House has published a set of "Literature Mini-Series." They are small format, with calico-patterned covers. Two series of forty books each have already been released, and the third series has started with a dozen or so books. From these hundred or so books, it can be seen that they mostly include good works from China and abroad, ancient and modern; the range of topics, whether in terms of era or region, has a certain proportion; the selected works, both modern and contemporary, are all well-known selections. The classical section, in Chinese literature, focuses on anthologies; in foreign literature, the standard is works that are both artistically high and contain generally healthy content, and which deal with life themes that readers are more familiar with. Although there is no editor's note or similar explanation in the books, the editor's intentions can generally be gleaned from the overall selection.

Small books do not necessarily have to be "shallow"; they can also encompass an artistic peak. The problem lies in the selection of items. This method of publishing mini-series exists in several countries around the world, such as the Soviet Union's "Spark" series and Japan's "Iwanami Bunko." The German "Reclam" series has always had a fixed small format, and a fixed cover and layout format, but its selections only include important works. It is said that this set of books enjoys such a reputation that readers can buy them without reading the content, and never be disappointed. It is necessary for mini-series to achieve this kind of reputation.

There is no doubt that the "Literature Mini-Series" is beneficial to readers. However, continuous improvement is what readers demand. Now, let's make a brief "pilgrimage" to this set of books and offer some suggestions for reference.

From the two series, Chinese classical literature accounts for six books. The number is not crucial, but the appropriateness of the selection is important. "The Book of Songs" and "Li Sao" are included in the first series, with appropriate annotations, which is very thoughtful from the reader's perspective. However, both books are mainly based on modern translations, and this is used as the title, which is worth considering. The role of modern translation is only to help appreciate and understand the original work. Even if it is a good translation, it is at most only attached to the original work. If the modern translation is the main focus and the original work is secondary, it seems a bit like putting the cart before the horse. The editor's intention is probably to help readers understand the original text, but since one wants to read the book, one cannot avoid using one's brain to understand the original work. Naturally, the editor's job is to do some work on the annotations, to do some "introduction" work. As for "getting into the swing of things," it is the reader's business, let the reader concentrate on studying and thinking for himself, and find out the secrets. It is probably not advisable to be thoughtful of everything for the reader, to the point of taking over everything.

In addition, the selected Tang and Song legends, Yuan operas, and vernacular stories are generally good, encompassing the rich styles of Chinese classical literature. When introducing Chinese classical literature in the mini-series, it may be better to start with the main treasures of poetry and prose first, such as pre-Qin prose literature, Yuefu poetry, and the poetry of Li Bai, Du Fu, and Bai Juyi, in chronological order.

In modern literature, the selected "May Fourth" works are extremely refined, and are mostly well-known works. On the other hand, the new creations are numerous and cover a wide range of aspects, including novels, poetry, reportage, plays, folk songs, folk tales, essays, special features, and revolutionary stories. The advantage is that it can reflect the diversity of literary forms today, but the disadvantage is that it is mixed and uneven. Some influential reportage and revolutionary stories can usually be bought in other editions, so I don't think it is necessary for the mini-series to rush to include them. As for folk songs and mass creations, it seems that because there are so many, it is not easy for the editors to select and compile them well, so I don't think there is any need to rush. What is noteworthy is the well-received new creations, such as Du Pengcheng's "In the Days of Peace" and Ai Wu's "New Home," which are both excellent works and would be worthy of inclusion in the mini-series. But it is a pity that not many such books have been included, and I think this is a regret. In addition, one feature that can be mentioned is the selection of short stories. For example, the book "Lily" selects three short stories, all of which are touching works on the theme of revolutionary struggle, and have a certain degree of artistic skill. The commentary by Comrade Mao Dun is attached to the end of the article, carefully analyzing and providing unique insights, and the excellent work and excellent commentary can be said to complement each other, which is undoubtedly helpful for readers to appreciate and study the work. This feature is still retained in the second series. A similar book is "Typical Report."

The translated works contained in the mini-series account for nearly half, and are mostly medium and short stories due to the limited space of the series itself. Because it includes countries from all over the world, both ancient and modern, the selections are dazzling and beautiful. I especially like some of the famous poems in it, such as Heine's collection of poems. His profound and moving pen tears apart the curtain of capitalism. His song for the life of the Silesian textile workers, full of sympathy, is a sad and indignant tune. Balzac's novel "The Usurer" and Maupassant's "Ball of Fat" attack bourgeois society like hammers, and are masterpieces of realistic literature that still excite readers today. "Mayakovsky's Selected Poems" is a good collection of his important short poems, including the famous "ROSTA Satire Windows," "Meeting Mania," and "Left March." In addition, it is worth mentioning the collection of poems "Sweat and Whip" by the Cuban revolutionary poet Guillén, which is an indictment against American imperialism. In these books, what attracts people like a red star is the collection of folk songs collected by Marx and Engels. Although only a few dozen songs are included, they all feel very beautiful to read, and it can be seen that these two revolutionary masters deeply loved folk literature.

Among the Chinese and foreign literature included, there are many excellent works, but there are also places that vary in quality, especially in modern literature, perhaps because the editors paid too much attention to the proportion and regional selection. But since it is small and exquisite, just like a string of pearls, it is necessary to maintain its crystal-clear and integrated style. In this way, it is not too much to ask that we make the selection of topics more rigorous. In short, it is the readers' expectation to make this set of "Literature Mini-Series" have its own complete ideological and artistic level, and truly become a good teacher and helpful friend to the readers.

    文学小丛书评介
    扈邑巴
    人民文学出版社出版了一套“文学小丛书”，小开本，印花布图案的封面，已经出了二辑，每辑四十本，第三辑也开始出了十几本。从这百来本书看，所收的大抵都是中外古今的好作品；选题范围，不论是时代、地域，都有着一定的比例；所选作品，近代的和现代的，都是众所熟知的选目。古典部分，中国文学以选本为旨，外国文学，则以艺术性既高而内容又大体健康，并且于读者较熟悉的生活题材的作品为标准。这些，虽然书内并无编辑例言之类作什么说明，但就全体选目看，大体可以窥见编辑者以上的一番心思。
    小本书不一定“浅”，它也可以包容着一个艺术高峰，问题是在于选目。这种小丛书的出版办法，世界上好几国都有，例如苏联的“星火”丛书，日本的“岩波文库”等就是。德国“莱克兰”丛书，从来就是固定的小开本，也从来就是固定的封面格式和排版格式，但是它的选目，非重要作品不收。据说这套书享有这样的声誉：读者可以不看内容，买来就是，决无上当。小丛书做到这样的信誉是必要的。
    “文学小丛书”有益于读者是无疑的。但精益求精，是读者的要求，现在来对这套书作一番粗浅的“巡礼”，并提出些意见以为参考。
    从两辑书中看，中国古典文学共收了六本，数目多寡无关宏旨，但选题是否相当，却是重要的。“诗经”与“离骚”见于第一辑，并附有适当的注释，于读者设想，是十分周到的。但是这两本书都是以今译为主，并以此冠为书名，这就值得斟酌了。今译的作用，只是为了有助于对原作的欣赏与理解，纵然是佳译，充其量亦不过附丽于原作而已，倘以今译为主，原作其次，似有点喧宾夺主了。编者的立意，恐怕是为了帮助读者理解原文，但既然要读书，就不免要费点脑子来理解原作。自然，编辑的工作是要作的，那就在注释上做工夫，做一些“引人”的工作，至于“入胜”，是读者的事，让读者自己去专攻、思索，自己去找出天地。一切为读者设想周到，以至包办代替，恐怕是不足为训的。
    此外，所选的唐宋传奇、元曲、话本，大体都好，这里包容了中国古典文学丰富的样式。小丛书在开手介绍中国古典文学时，关于话本不妨从缓，先从主要的诗文宝藏入手，如以年代次序计，先秦的散文文学，乐府诗，李白、杜甫、白居易的诗等，尽可以先选。
    近代的文学，“五四”作品所选几本，都极其精炼，多属烩炙人口之作。倒是新创作，份量既多，方面又广，有小说、诗、报告文学、剧本、民歌、民间故事、散文特写、革命故事等，好处是可以反映出今天文学形式的多样性，缺点则是杂，参差不齐。有些影响较大的报告文学和革命故事，通常可以买到别的本子，我以为小丛书就不必急忙收入。至于歌谣及群众创作，看来是因为多，编者选辑不易，因而也不易做得好，我看也不必急忙。可注意的是有好评的新创作，例如杜鹏程的“在和平的日子里”，艾芜的“新的家”等，都是佳作，列入小丛书中当无愧色。但可惜这类书收入的还不多，我看是一个缺憾。此外，有一个特色是可以提一提的，就是选短篇，例如“百合花”一书选了三个短篇，都是以革命斗争为题材的动人心魄之作，艺术上也有一定的工力，不失为好小说。文后附有茅盾同志的评论，精心缕析，见解独到，佳作佳评，可谓相得益彰，于读者欣赏与揣摩作品之有帮助，是不消说的。这一特色，在第二辑中仍保留着，类似的一本，是“典型报告”。
    小丛书容纳的翻译作品几占半数，为丛书本身篇幅所限，收的也都是中短篇。因为包含了世界各国，有古有今，从选目看，便觉绚丽夺目，美不胜收。我尤其喜欢其中的几个名篇，如海?的诗集，他的深沉而感人的笔，撕裂着资本主义的幕帷，他的充满了同情的为西利西亚纺织工人生活的歌唱，是一首忧伤而愤激的曲子。巴尔扎克的小说“高利贷者”，莫泊桑的“羊脂球”，就如铁锤一样抨击着资产阶级社会，是至今读来仍为之激动的现实主义文学的杰作。“马雅可夫斯基诗选”，是选了他重要短诗的一本好诗集，有名的“罗斯塔讽刺之窗”，“开会迷”，“向左进行曲”，都在内。另外，值得一提的是古巴革命诗人纪廉的诗集“汗和鞭子”，是一本向美帝国主义的控诉书。在这些书中，像一颗红星似地吸引着人的，是马克思、恩格斯收集的民歌集，所收虽寥寥二十几首，但读来觉得都十分优美，这里可以看出这两位革命大师对民间文学深切的爱好。
    不论中外文学所收的，佳作多，但也还有高低不一的地方，尤其是现代文学方面，也许是编者过于照顾到比例和地域选择的缘故罢。但既然是小而精，就如一串珍珠一样，保持其晶莹的浑然一体的风格，是必须的。这样，我们提出选题再严谨一些，就不是什么苛求了。总之，使这套“文学小丛书”具有自己完整的思想和艺术水平，真正成为读者的良师益友，这是读者的期望。
