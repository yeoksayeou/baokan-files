Anshan, May 12 (from our newspaper) – The East Anshan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has adopted the leadership method of "listen, feel, debate, test, and do," fully leveraging the power of the "three-combination" of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers. This has led to a breakthrough in the "flotation and filtration barrier," causing concentrate production and quality to soar. The daily output of concentrate has steadily increased from 1,500 tons in the past to over 5,000 tons, the water content has dropped from over 15% to around 12%, and the tailings grade has decreased from 28% to 14%. According to the national plan requirements, the concentrate floated by the East Anshan Iron Mine this year will supply Anshan Iron and Steel, and will be refined into more than one million tons of high-quality steel.

The ore produced in East Anshan is lean hematite ore. Hematite is not magnetic and cannot be directly magnetically separated; it can only be magnetically separated after magnetizing and roasting, or directly by flotation, to produce concentrate. At present, many countries have not solved the technical and equipment problems of flotation for producing several million tons of concentrate annually. The East Anshan flotation workshop, designed independently by China, was put into production last year on National Day. In the first two months, the daily output of concentrate only reached 300 to 400 tons. In order to increase the output of concentrate, the leading cadres of the East Anshan Iron Mine analyzed and studied the situation, and found that the weak link was in flotation and filtration. At that time, the technical personnel and workers only had theoretical knowledge and operating experience in magnetic separation. They were unable to overcome the difficulties of flotation, such as the grinding particle size being too fine, the mud content being too high, the viscosity being too great, and the difficulty in filtration. The East Anshan Iron Mine Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately issued a call to all employees: "Break through the filtration barrier and turn the whole mine around!" mobilizing the masses to overcome this weak link.

At that time, technicians and workers actively participated in the battle, but because the three aspects of cadres, workers, and technical personnel were not closely integrated, the technicians only checked theories, flipped through materials, and worked behind closed doors in the laboratory; the workers only looked for reasons and solutions from the operation and equipment; although the leading cadres went deep into the front lines, they only generally understood the situation and did not effectively concentrate everyone's wisdom to point out the direction. As a result, some budding experiences created by the workers could not be summarized and improved; the technicians' experiments were divorced from reality and could not get the assistance of the workers; the leading cadres did not accurately understand the problems and felt at a loss. Therefore, the production effect in the first stage was not significant.

Based on this situation, the Party committee made a summary, believing that to break through the production technology barrier, it was necessary to closely integrate leading cadres, workers, and technical personnel, learn from each other's strengths, and pool collective wisdom. It was also believed that truly implementing the "three-combination" was not just about cadres, workers, and technical personnel attending meetings and debating together, but more importantly, they had to be combined in labor practice. To this end, in addition to continuously strengthening ideological leadership, the mine adopted the leadership method of "listen, feel, debate, test, and do."

"Listen" means fully promoting democracy and patiently listening to opinions from all sides; "feel" means, based on the opinions of the masses, getting to the bottom of things in labor practice; "debate" means organizing the "three-combination" to conduct full debates and concentrate everyone's wisdom; "test" means conducting on-the-spot tests based on the results of the debate, affirming them before making a decision; "do" means making decisions based on the test results and organizing the vast number of employees to implement them.

Because this method was conscientiously implemented and the enthusiasm of the employees was fully brought into play, the entire mine was given a new look, and concentrate production rapidly increased. For example, in February, after discovering that workers added clean water to the filter to improve production efficiency, the Party Secretary and the Mine Manager of the East Anshan Iron Mine, together with leading comrades from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry of the Central Government who came to the mine to help, went deep into the work sections to get to the bottom of things, and then organized a three-combination debate and on-the-spot tests. As a result, they found out the laws that adding clean water and replacing filter cloths could improve the output and quality of concentrate powder, and summarized six major operating points. After vigorous promotion, the daily output of concentrate soared to more than 2,000 tons. For example, when this workshop was first put into production, many workers raised the issue that the capacity of the centrifugal pump was insufficient and that the location of the water-air separator was inappropriate, but many technicians did not believe it. In March, the mine used the "three-combination" method, after leading cadres, technical personnel and workers worked together to get to the bottom of things, debate, and test, raising the position of the water-air separator, which increased the capacity of the centrifugal pump, and the average daily output of concentrate jumped to more than 5,000 tons, and the highest reached more than 5,500 tons.

The experience of the East Anshan Iron Mine proves that the implementation of the "three-combination" must be based on leading cadres as the core and the mass movement as the foundation. The method of "listen, feel, debate, test, and do" fully embodies this spirit. This leadership method is a new development of the "three-combination." It not only makes the "three-combination" truly become a technical organizational form with core leadership and capable of solving key production problems, accelerates the growth of technical personnel, and effectively improves the production technology level of enterprises, but also greatly improves the leadership level, further strengthens the Party's leading role, and makes the relationship between leaders and the masses closer than ever. Now, the East Anshan Iron Mine has established this leadership method as a regular system to solve various practical problems. Recently, they used this method to summarize the rich experience in breaking through the flotation and filtration barrier, and formulated new operating procedures, striving for a greater leap forward in concentrate production.

    东鞍山铁矿发展三结合
    精矿增两倍日产五千吨
    干部、工人、技术人员拧成一股绳
    本报鞍山12日电  鞍山钢铁公司东鞍山铁矿采取“听、摸、辩、试、干”的领导方法，充分发挥了领导干部、技术人员和工人“三结合”的威力，突破了“浮选过滤关”，使精矿产量和质量插翅直上。精矿日产量从过去的一千五百吨稳定上升到五千吨以上，含水量由15％以上降为12％左右，尾矿品位由过去28％降为14％。按照国家计划要求，东鞍山铁矿今年浮选出来的精矿，将供应鞍钢炼成百万吨以上的优质钢。
    东鞍山所产矿石是赤铁贫矿。赤铁矿没有磁性不能直接磁选，只有磁化熔烧后进行磁选或直接用浮选才能生产精矿。目前，好多国家对年产几百万吨精矿的浮选技术和设备问题尚未解决。我国自行设计的东鞍山浮选车间，去年国庆节投入生产后头两个月，精矿日产只达三、四百吨。为了提高精矿的产量，东鞍山铁矿领导干部经过分析、研究，发现薄弱环节是在浮选过滤方面。当时技术人员和工人，只有磁选技术理论和操作经验，对浮选磨矿粒度太细、多泥、粘性又大，不易过滤的困难，无法克服。中共东鞍山铁矿党委立即向全体职工提出“突破过滤关、全矿把身翻”的号召，发动群众克服这一薄弱环节。
    当时技职人员和工人都积极参加了战斗，但是由于干部、工人、技术人员三方面没有密切结合，技术人员只是查理论，翻资料，闷头在试验室搞试验；工人只是自己从操作上、设备上找原因，想办法；领导干部虽然深入现场，但只是一般地了解情况，没有很好地集中大家的智慧，指出方向。结果是：工人创造的一些萌芽性经验得不到总结提高；技术人员的试验脱离实际，得不到工人的协助；领导干部对问题看得不准，感到茫无头绪，因而头一阶段生产效果很不显著。
    根据这一段情况，党委作了总结，认为要突破生产技术关，就必须使领导干部、工人、技术人员密切结合起来，取长补短，集思广益。并且认为，真正贯彻“三结合”，不只是干部、工人、技术人员在一起开会辩论就行了，更重要的是他们必须要在劳动实践中结合。为此，这个矿除了不断加强思想领导外，采取了“听、摸、辩、试、干”的领导方法，
  “听”是充分发扬民主，耐心听取各方面的意见；“摸”是根据群众的意见，在劳动实践中摸底；“辩”是组织好“三结合”进行充分辩论，集中大家的智慧；“试”是根据辩论的结果，进行实地试验，肯定了再做出决定；“干”是根据试验结果，做出决定，组织广大职工实行。
    由于认真地贯彻了这个方法，充分地发挥了职工的积极性，使得全矿面貌为之一新，精矿生产迅速上升。如在2月间发现工人在过滤机里加清水提高了生产效率的情况后，东鞍山铁矿的党委书记、矿长，便和当时来矿帮助工作的中央冶金工业部的领导同志，深入工段摸清了底细，接着又组织三结合辩论会和实地试验，结果找出了加清水和补滤布等能提高精矿粉产量和质量的规律，总结出六大操作要点。经过大力推广，精矿日产量猛升到两千吨以上。又如这个车间刚投入生产时，就有好多工人提出离心泵能力不足和水气分离器安放位置不适当的问题，但好多技职人员不相信。3月间，这个矿运用“三结合”的办法，经过领导干部、技术人员和工人一起劳动摸底、辩论、试验，升高水气分离器的位置，使离心泵能力增加，精矿平均日产量又飞跃到五千吨以上，最高达到五千五百多吨。
    东鞍山铁矿经验证明，实行“三结合”必须以领导干部为核心和以群众运动为基础。而“听、摸、辩、试、干”的方法，就充分体现了这个精神。这种领导方法是“三结合”的新发展。它不仅使“三结合”真正成为一个有核心领导、能解决生产关键问题的技术组织形式，加快了技术人员的成长，有效地提高了企业的生产技术水平，同时也使领导水平有了很大的提高，进一步加强了党的领导作用，使领导和群众的关系比任何时候都更为密切。现在，东鞍山铁矿已把这个领导方法订为经常的制度，来解决各种实际问题。最近他们用这个方法，总结了在突破浮选过滤关中丰富的经验，并制出新的操作规程，力争精矿生产更大的跃进。
