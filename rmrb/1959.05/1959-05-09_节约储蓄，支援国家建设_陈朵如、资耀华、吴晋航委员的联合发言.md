　　Saving and Thrift, Supporting National Construction
　　Joint Speech by Commissioners Chen Duoru, Zi Yaohua, and Wu Jinheng
　　We fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 national financial statement and the draft of the 1959 national budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We express our firm commitment to implement them. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country experienced an unprecedented great leap forward in the national economy in 1958, achieving brilliant accomplishments on all fronts. This is something that every Chinese person is delighted and encouraged by. Now, on the basis of the great victory of 1958, the people of the whole country are exerting even greater efforts and continuing to leap forward. Premier Zhou called on us: In order to realize the high-speed, large-scale 1959 plan, we should immediately launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy in every corner of the country. Based on this call, we will discuss some views and opinions on saving and thrift.
　　We all know that in order to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, in addition to the fact that all enterprises, institutions, and other units of the country should take improving labor productivity, increasing production, practicing strict economy, and opposing waste as their goals, practicing strict economy in personal life and participating in savings should also be an important part of the movement to increase production and practice economy.
　　Since the founding of our country, the Party and the government have always attached importance to and encouraged people to save and deposit. Over the past few years, with the enthusiastic response of the masses, people's savings have developed rapidly. According to our understanding, the savings deposits of the People's Bank of China nationwide have been increasing year by year. As of the end of 1958, the total amount of deposits reached 4.1 billion yuan; of which 1.3 billion yuan was added in 1958 alone, which was the fastest development and greatly exceeded the growth rate of deposits in previous years. This amount is equivalent to the total investment of ten Yangtze River bridges; it can build three steel plants with an annual output of one million tons; and twenty nitrogen fertilizer plants with an annual output of 50,000 tons of synthetic ammonia. The rapid growth of savings deposits has become an important and reliable source of funds for national construction. At the same time, it also fully reflects the infinite superiority of the continuous increase in people's income and the continuous improvement of people's living standards under the socialist system. In the future, with the rapid development of the national economy and the gradual increase in people's monetary income, savings deposits will inevitably grow faster, and supporting the needs of national construction funds through people's saving and thrift will increasingly show an important role.
　　Saving and thrift are not only necessary for the country to accumulate funds and accumulate part of the social purchasing power, but also have great benefits for individuals. Regularly participating in savings can not only cultivate the virtues of diligence and thrift, but also help individuals reasonably arrange their lives and consume better to meet their growing material and cultural needs. At the same time, because participating in savings supports the development of social productive forces, and as productive forces continue to develop and social products continue to enrich, it in turn promotes the continuous improvement of people's living standards. Therefore, saving and thrift also embodies the close combination of the personal interests and national interests, and the immediate interests and long-term interests of the broad masses of working people.
　　Over the past few years, the significance and role of saving and thrift have become increasingly familiar to the masses of society, and it is a powerful tool for managing a family diligently and building the country diligently, so people's savings have developed rapidly, which is a very good phenomenon. However, according to our understanding, one situation is worth noting. Since the rural communes were established in 1958, due to the unclear understanding of the communization policy by some people, fearing that deposits would be turned over to the public, the People's Bank in many places once experienced a decline in deposits. Later, after the publication of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes, although the idea of some people fearing that deposits would be turned over to the public has been resolved, some people have an unclear understanding of the socialist principle of distribution according to work, as well as the distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system implemented by the commune, and believe that it is not necessary to manage the family diligently after the implementation of the supply system, the scope of the supply system is expanding day by day, and the growth of social welfare undertakings, saving and thrift is not necessary. Therefore, some people say: "Now it is one for eating, two for clothing, and three for using," "Life is guaranteed, and it is useless to save money." These confused thoughts are not the main or essential for the vast number of workers, but they also show that the savings departments of the People's Bank in various places need to further develop social savings publicity. Of course, because savings work is very popular, it is limited to widely carry out social publicity work solely relying on the human resources of the bank. Therefore, we suggest that in order to make the significance and role of saving and thrift deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, we hope that the propaganda departments of all parties, organs, enterprises, factories, mines, and people's organizations will cooperate with the bank to carry out savings propaganda, encourage, and inspire the masses to participate in saving and thrift more enthusiastically. At the same time, the People's Bank should continuously improve the quality of service and facilitate deposits and withdrawals through the red flag competition movement that is being vigorously carried out in various places, so that the masses are happy to participate in savings.
　　We hope that you will correct us if the above views and opinions are appropriate.
　　Finally, we more firmly support the government's measures on the Tibet issue, and completely quell the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion in Tibet, so as to build a socialist new Tibet.
　　We wish the conference success and all members good health!

　　节约储蓄，支援国家建设
    陈朵如、资耀华、吴晋航委员的联合发言
    我们完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，李维汉副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。我们表示要坚决贯彻执行。我们国家在党和毛主席的英明领导下，一九五八年出现了我国历史上前所未有的国民经济的大跃进，在各个战线上取得了辉煌的成就。这是每一个中国人民所欢欣鼓舞的。现在全国人民在一九五八年的巨大胜利的基础上鼓足更大干劲，继续跃进。周总理号召我们：为了实现速度很高、规模宏大的一九五九年计划，我们应当在全国的每一个角落，立即开展一个全民性的增产节约运动。根据这一号召，我们谈一谈关于节约储蓄方面的一些看法和意见。
    我们都知道，开展增产节约运动，除了国家一切企业、机关等单位，都应当把提高劳动生产率、增加生产、厉行节约、反对浪费作为奋斗目标外，在个人生活上厉行节约参加储蓄，也应该是增产节约运动的一个重要内容。
    我国建国以来，党和政府一直重视并鼓励人民节约储蓄。几年来，在群众热烈的响应下人民储蓄获得了迅速发展。据我们了解，全国人民银行储蓄存款年年都在增加，截至一九五八年底止存款总额已达四十一亿元；其中一九五八年一年即增加十三亿元，发展最快，大大超过了过去历年存款的增长的速度，这笔数目相当十条长江大桥的总投资额；可以兴建年产一百万吨的钢铁厂三个；年产五万吨合成氨的氮肥厂二十个。储蓄存款的迅速增长已成为国家建设资金的重要的和可靠的来源之一。同时，也充分体现了在社会主义制度下人民收入不断增加和人民生活水平不断提高的无限优越性。今后随着国民经济的迅速发展，人民货币收入的逐渐增加，储蓄存款必然增长得更快，通过人民节约储蓄支持国家建设资金的需要将日益显示出重要作用。
    节约储蓄，不仅对国家积累资金并蕴蓄一部分社会购买力，对平衡市场商品供应大有必要，对个人来说，也有很大的好处。经常参加储蓄，既可以培养勤俭节约的美德，又可以帮助个人合理安排生活更好地消费，以满足日益增长的物质文化需要。同时由于参加了储蓄支援了社会生产力的发展，生产力不断发展，社会产品不断丰富，反过来又促进人民生活水平的不断提高。所以节约储蓄也正体现了广大劳动人民个人利益与国家利益，眼前利益与长远利益密切的结合。
    几年来，对于节约储蓄的意义和作用，日益为社会群众所熟悉了解，是一个勤俭持家、勤俭建国的有力工具，因而人民储蓄有了迅速的发展，这是一个很好的现象。但是据我们了解一种情况是值得注意的，自一九五八年农村公社化以后，由于部分群众对公社化政策认识不清，怕存款归公，许多地方的人民银行曾经一度发生存款下降的现象。后来党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议公布以后，某些群众怕存款归公的思想虽已解决，但有些人又对社会主义按劳分配原则，以及公社所实行的供给制与工资制相结合的分配制度认识不清，认为实行供给制后不需要勤俭持家了，供给制范围日益扩大，社会福利事业增长，节约储蓄没有什么必要了。因此有人说：“现在是一吃、二穿、三用”，“生活有了保障，攒钱没有用了”。这些糊涂的思想，对广大的职工说来并不是主要的，本质的，但是也说明了各地人民银行的储蓄部门对社会储蓄宣传有待于进一步深入开展。当然由于储蓄工作群众性很大，单纯依靠银行人力条件广泛开展社会宣传工作是有一定局限性的。因此，我们建议：为了使节约储蓄的意义作用深入人心，希望各党派、各机关、企业、厂矿、人民团体的宣传部门，配合银行经常进行储蓄宣传、鼓励、启发群众更踊跃参加节约储蓄。同时人民银行应该通过现在各地正在轰轰烈烈开展的红旗竞赛运动，不断提高服务质量，便利存取，使群众乐于参加储蓄。
    以上的一些看法和意见，是否妥当，希望各位指正。
    最后，我们更坚决拥护政府关于西藏问题的措施，并彻底平息西藏反革命武装叛乱，从而建设一个社会主义的新西藏。
    敬祝大会成功，各位委员身体健康！
