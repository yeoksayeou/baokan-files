Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 13th. The Ministry of Chemical Industry convened a National Small-Scale Indigenous Sulfuric Acid Production Conference at the Nanjing Chemical Industry Company from May 5th to 9th. The conference decided that, while consolidating and improving existing tower method and contact method sulfuric acid production, efforts should be accelerated to develop small-scale contact method sulfuric acid plants to increase sulfuric acid production and meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, in implementing the policy of simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and simultaneously pursuing modern and indigenous production methods, the chemical industry has greatly developed small-scale indigenous sulfuric acid production. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, 1,606 small-scale tower method sulfuric acid plants have now been built, of which 410 are in normal production, with output generally exceeding design capacity by about one-fold. 227 small-scale contact method sulfuric acid plants have been built, of which 66 are in normal production, with a daily output of over one ton. Indigenous sulfuric acid production in Wuhan, Luoyang, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places has become an important source for meeting local needs. The conference believes that after a year of production practice, small-scale sulfuric acid plants have greatly improved in management, a new technical force is growing, production technology has passed the test, and some regions have created good experiences. At present, as long as the existing advanced experiences are summarized and promoted, and the potential of existing equipment is fully utilized, so that the general production level is raised to the advanced level, sulfuric acid production can be greatly increased.

After full discussion, the conference decided to incorporate national indigenous sulfuric acid production into the state plan, requiring the production of 80,000 tons of sulfuric acid this year. To this end, the conference decided that on the basis of consolidating and improving existing small-scale sulfuric acid plants, small-scale contact method sulfuric acid plants should be further developed this year.

The conference fully discussed measures to promote the rapid development of small-scale sulfuric acid plants, emphasizing that all regions must conscientiously implement the spirit of self-reliance in terms of raw materials and equipment manufacturing, and should cooperate with each other in technology and exchange experiences.

    推广土法生产硫酸经验
    全国硫酸会议确定新的努力目标
    新华社南京13日电  化学工业部5月5日到9日在南京化学工业公司，召开了全国小型土法硫酸生产会议。这次会议决定在巩固和提高现有塔式法和接触法硫酸生产的基础上，加速发展小型接触法硫酸厂，增加硫酸产量，满足工农业生产需要。
    去年大跃进以来，化学工业在贯彻大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举的方针中，大大发展了小型土法硫酸生产。据二十七个省、市、自治区的初步统计，现在已经建成小型塔式法硫酸厂一千六百零六座，其中正常生产的有四百一十座，产量一般都超过设计能力一倍左右。小型接触法硫酸厂已经建成二百二十七座，其中正常生产的有六十六座，日产量达到一吨以上。武汉、洛阳、北京、上海等地土法生产的硫酸，已经成为供应当地需要的一个重要来源。会议认为小型硫酸厂经过一年的生产实践，在管理上有了很大提高，新的技术队伍正在成长，生产技术已经过关，有的地区并创造了较好的经验。目前只要将已有的先进经验总结起来加以推广，充分发挥现有设备潜力，使一般生产水平提高到先进水平，硫酸产量还可以大大增加。
    会议经过充分的讨论，决定将全国的土法硫酸生产纳入国家计划，要求今年生产硫酸八万吨。为此，会议确定在整顿巩固提高现有小型硫酸厂的基础上，今年要进一步发展小型接触法硫酸厂。
    会议全面讨论了促进小型硫酸厂迅速发展的措施，强调指出各地在原材料和设备制造方面必须认真贯彻自力更生的精神，在技术方面应互相协作，交流经验。
