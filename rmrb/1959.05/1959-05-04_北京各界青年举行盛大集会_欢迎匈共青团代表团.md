Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Beijing youth from all walks of life, over a thousand people, held a rally on the evening of the 2nd to welcome the Hungarian Communist Youth League delegation visiting China. Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and Secretaries Wang Wei and Liang Buting also attended the welcoming meeting.

Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting, extending a warm welcome to the Hungarian friends. He said: "In the short two years since its establishment, the Hungarian Communist Youth League, under the strong leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, has inherited and carried forward the long and glorious tradition of the Hungarian Communist youth movement, united the broad masses of Hungarian youth, and made outstanding contributions to Hungary's socialist revolution and socialist construction." He expressed great joy at the achievements of the Hungarian Communist Youth League and expressed his intention to take advantage of this visit by the delegation to learn from the work experience of the fraternal Hungarian Communist Youth League. Wang Zhaohua also said: "In the struggle of our people and youth to build socialism and oppose aggression, the Hungarian people and youth have always given our people strong support and assistance. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Hungarian people and youth for this fraternal support and assistance."

Komocsin Zoltán, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League, praised the achievements of the Chinese people and youth in the Great Leap Forward last year in his speech.

He then introduced the situation of Hungarian youth, saying: In the past two years, Hungary's overall situation has greatly developed, and Hungarian youth have also made great progress, with the greatest progress being made by young workers. The Hungarian youth labor competition groups, which were destroyed by the counter-revolutionary rebellion two years ago, have been restored, and now 10% to 15% of young workers have participated in various competition groups. 10% of young workers participated in the conservation movement. University and college students are studying better than in the past. In the countryside, conscious young peasants are actively participating in socialist transformation. In the past two years, Hungarian youth have undertaken various social obligations, and three million young people have participated in various public welfare and voluntary labor. Today, more and more young people are participating in public welfare labor, and the proletarian internationalist consciousness of young people has also been greatly improved. He said with confidence: The Hungarian Communist Youth League has all the conditions and possibilities to unite Hungarian youth around the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

Komocsin finally shouted: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and Hungary!"

The more than one thousand young people attending the meeting expressed a warm welcome to Komocsin's speech with enthusiastic applause.

    北京各界青年举行盛大集会
    欢迎匈共青团代表团
    新华社3日讯　北京市各界青年一千多人2日晚上集会欢迎来中国访问的匈牙利共产主义青年团代表团。中国共产主义青年团中央第一书记胡耀邦，书记处书记王伟、梁步庭等也出席了欢迎大会。
    共青团北京市委第一书记王照华在会上讲了话，他向匈牙利朋友们表示热烈欢迎。他说：“匈牙利共青团在它建立的短短两年中，在匈牙利社会主义工人党的坚强领导下，继承和发扬了匈牙利共产主义者青年运动的悠久的光荣传统，团结了广大匈牙利青年，对匈牙利的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业做出了卓越的贡献。”他对匈牙利共青团的成就感到十分高兴，并且表示要利用这次代表团来访的机会学习兄弟的匈牙利共青团工作的经验。王照华还说：“在我国人民和青年建设社会主义和反对侵略的斗争中，匈牙利人民和青年一贯给予我国人民有力的支持和援助。我们对匈牙利人民和青年这种兄弟支持和援助表示衷心的感谢。”
    匈牙利共青团中央第一书记科莫钦·佐尔坦在讲话中赞扬了中国人民与青年去年大跃进的成就。
    他接着介绍了匈牙利青年的情况，他说：过去两年来，匈牙利全国情况有很大发展，匈牙利青年也有很大进步，而青年工人的进步最大。两年前被反革命叛乱所破坏的匈牙利青年劳动竞赛小组恢复了，现在已有10％到15％的青年工人参加了各种竞赛小组。有10％的青工参加了节约运动。大学、专科学校学生学习比过去要好。在农村，有觉悟的青年农民积极参加社会主义改造。过去两年来，匈牙利青年人承担了各种社会义务，三百万青年参加了各种公益劳动和义务劳动。今天，参加公益劳动的青年愈来愈多，青年的无产阶级国际主义觉悟也大大提高了。他充满信心地说：匈牙利共青团具有一切条件和可能把匈牙利青年团结在匈牙利社会主义工人党的周围。
    科莫钦最后高呼：“中匈两国永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    参加大会的一千多名青年用热烈的掌声对科莫钦的讲话表示热烈欢迎。
