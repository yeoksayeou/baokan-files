Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: The sown area of both sugarcane and beetroot will exceed last year. According to statistics from a telephone conference on sugar crops convened by the Ministry of Agriculture on the evening of the 19th, various regions have planted 5.33 million mu of sugarcane (including ratoon cane), an increase of 550,000 mu compared to last year. Guangdong and other regions are still rushing to plant; 4.47 million mu of beetroot have been sown, with the northern regions still intensifying sowing, and the summer sowing of beetroot in southern regions is about to begin, which will also exceed the area of last year.

According to reports from various regions, the sowing quality of sugar crops is better than in previous years. The area of improved sugarcane varieties has expanded to 2.87 million mu, an increase of 85% compared to last year, with Fujian Province increasing by 1.3 times. Sugarcane fields in Guangxi have generally been deeply ploughed to a depth of eight inches or more, one or two inches deeper than last year. The amount of seedlings used in various regions has generally increased, with Zhanjiang, Guangdong, increasing from 2,500 seedlings per mu last year to more than 4,000 seedlings. In Heilongjiang and other provinces, more than 60% of beetroot is planted on autumn-ploughed land, and the close-planting measures of shortening ridges and increasing rows have been implemented. The amount of base fertilizer per mu in Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and other regions has increased from 2,000-3,000 jin in previous years to 5,000 jin. Currently, ratoon cane in Guangxi is already more than three feet tall; newly planted sugarcane in Guangdong has more than 6,000 effective stems per mu, while the same period last year only had 4,000-5,000 stems; early-sown beetroot in Heilongjiang and other major beetroot producing areas already has two pairs of true leaves. Various regions are seizing the time to strengthen field management, generally proposing to vigorously develop indigenous pesticides and fertilizers, and promptly apply topdressing fertilizer and prevent and control pests and diseases, striving for full and strong seedlings.

The conference requested that various regions seize the season, strive to complete the original sowing plan, and quickly complete the contracting of production, so that the increase in production targets and measures are implemented.

The conference pointed out that pest control and seedling protection is the first hurdle in realizing this year's sugar crop increase plan. Various regions must do a good job in checking seedlings and replanting seedlings, thinning and setting seedlings early, and cultivating ratoon cane. On the basis of strengthening field management, launch a large-scale, high-yield movement for sugar crops. In addition to paying attention to the preparation of fertilizers and pesticides, it is also necessary to arrange for the reform of tools for intertillage, earthing up, cane cutting, and short-distance transportation.

The conference also emphasized that agricultural departments should closely liaise with industrial and other departments so that sugar production can coordinate with and meet the needs of processing units as much as possible. Newly expanded sugar-producing areas should contact industrial departments as early as possible to arrange processing equipment. The conference believed that Guangdong's agricultural and industrial departments jointly held a meeting to arrange sugar production and processing plans, and that Fujian sent people to the countryside to inspect the coordination of sugar production and processing, these methods are very good and can be used for reference by various regions.

    甘蔗甜菜播种面积超过去年
    新华社22日讯　今年甘蔗、甜菜的播种面积都将超过去年。据农业部19日晚召开的糖料作物电话会议统计，各地已种植甘蔗五百三十三万亩（包括宿根蔗），比去年扩大了五十五万亩，广东等地仍在继续抢种中；甜菜已播种四百四十七万亩，北方仍在加紧播种，南方夏播甜菜地区即将开始播种，也将超过去年面积。
    根据各地汇报，糖料作物的播种质量都比往年好。甘蔗的良种面积已扩大到二百八十七万亩，比去年增加了85％，其中福建省增加了一点三倍。广西的蔗田普遍深耕八寸以上，比去年加深了一两寸。各地种苗用量普遍增加，广东湛江由去年每亩种二千五百条，增加到四千多条。黑龙江等省的甜菜，60％以上都种在秋翻地上，并且贯彻了缩垅增行的密植措施。吉林、内蒙古等地每亩的基肥量由往年的二、三千斤，增加到五千斤。目前，广西的宿根蔗已有三尺多高；广东新植的甘蔗每亩有效茎已有六千多条，而去年同期只有四、五千条；黑龙江等主要甜菜产区早播的甜菜，已有二对真叶了，各地正抓紧田间管理，普遍提出要大搞土农药、土化肥，及时追肥和防治病虫害，力争苗全苗壮。
    会议要求各地抓紧季节，争取完成原定的播种计划，并且迅速完成包产工作，使增产指标和增产措施落实。
    会议指出，治虫保苗是实现今年糖料增产计划的第一关，各地必须做好查苗、补苗工作，及早间苗、定苗和对宿根蔗的培植。在加强田间管理的基础上，开展糖料作物大面积高额丰产运动。除注意准备肥料、药械外，还要安排中耕、培土、砍蔗、短途运输的工具改革。
    会议还强调农业部门要密切和工业等部门的联系，使糖料生产能配合和尽量满足加工单位的需要，新扩大的糖料地区要及早联系工业部门及早安排加工设备。会议认为广东农业、工业部门一起开会安排糖料生产和加工计划，以及福建派人下乡检查糖料生产和加工的配合情况，这些办法都很好，可供各地参考。
