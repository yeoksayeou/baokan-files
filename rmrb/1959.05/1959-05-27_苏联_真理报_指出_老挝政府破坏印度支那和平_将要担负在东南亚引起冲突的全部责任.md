Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 26th: "Pravda" published an article today entitled "The Laotian Government's Provocative Actions."

The article points out that the Laotian Sananikone government is grossly violating the Geneva Accords and is pushing Laos onto the road of civil war. The Laotian government is also constantly carrying out provocative activities on the borders of Laos with China and Vietnam, all of which are being carried out with the support and instigation of the United States.

After pointing out the serious situation created by the Laotian government's recent persecution of former Pathet Lao fighting forces, the article said that international public opinion must not be indifferent to these dangerous actions that undermine peace in Indochina and exacerbate tensions in Asia. The article said that the Laotian government is grossly violating its own obligations regarding not participating in aggressive blocs and not allowing Laotian territory to be used for aggressive purposes. Laotian government forces are increasingly frequently violating the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and directly colluding with Chiang Kai-shek elements, condoning their provocative acts against the People's Republic of China, while also carrying out sabotage activities against Cambodia. The article emphasized that it is no secret that these actions of the Laotian government are being carried out with the support and instigation of the United States. Everyone knows that the United States supplies Laos with more munitions than it needs for defense purposes and is trying its best to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc.

The article said that the Sananikone government's provocative activities are directly related to the resolutions of the recent meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The article said that international public opinion fully agrees with the statements of the Chinese and Vietnamese governments on the Laotian situation and demands an immediate end to the persecution of former Pathet Lao fighting forces.

The article concluded by saying that the people of all countries demand that Laos' provocations against China and Vietnam be stopped and that the activities of the International Commission for Laos be resumed quickly. The Laotian government should heed these warnings and draw appropriate conclusions, otherwise it will bear full responsibility for causing conflict in Southeast Asia.

    苏联“真理报”指出
    老挝政府破坏印度支那和平
    将要担负在东南亚引起冲突的全部责任
    据新华社莫斯科26日电  “真理报”今天发表了一篇题为“老挝政府的挑衅行动”的文章。
    文章指出，老挝萨纳尼空政府粗暴地破坏了日内瓦协议，正把老挝推上内战的道路。老挝政府还不断在老挝同中国和同越南的边境进行挑衅活动，这都是在美国支持和唆使之下进行的。
    文章在指出了老挝政府最近迫害前寮国战斗部队的行为所造成的严重局势后说，国际公众舆论决不能对这些破坏印度支那和平和加剧亚洲紧张局势的危险行动漠不关心。文章说，老挝政府正在粗暴地破坏它自己所承担的关于不参加侵略集团和不使老挝领土被用于侵略目的的义务。老挝政府部队正越来越频繁地侵犯越南民主共和国领土和直接同蒋介石分子勾结，纵容他们进行反对中华人民共和国的挑衅行为，同时还对柬埔寨进行破坏活动。文章强调指出，老挝政府的这些行动是在美国支持和唆使下进行的，这已不是什么秘密了。谁都知道美国供给老挝超过它用于国防目的所需要的军火，并竭力把老挝拖入东南亚条约侵略集团。
    文章说，萨纳尼空政府的挑衅活动和东南亚条约组织的最近一次会议的决议是有直接联系的。
    文章说，国际公众舆论完全赞同中、越两国政府对老挝事件的声明，并要求立即停止对前寮国战斗部队的迫害。
    文章最后说，各国人民要求制止老挝对中国和越南的挑衅，迅速恢复老挝国际委员会的活动。老挝政府应该倾听这些警告并得出相应结论，否则它将担负在东南亚引起冲突的全部责任。
