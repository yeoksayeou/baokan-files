Excellent product quality is welcomed by the people and satisfies the nation, and production units can also better achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy as a result. Conversely, poor product quality not only directly wastes raw materials and man-hours, increasing costs, but also causes waste and trouble for user departments. Therefore, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, firmly grasping the crucial gate of product quality is extremely important.

How to hold this gate well? The most important thing is to strictly implement the quality inspection system from raw materials, materials, semi-finished products to finished products. Raw materials entering the factory must of course be inspected by designated personnel, and products leaving the factory must also be inspected by designated personnel. Moreover, it is even more necessary to pay attention to inspecting whether each component and part meets the specifications during the production process. If each factory manages the two checkpoints of entry and exit well, and also manages the middle section well, then defective products cannot enter and exit casually, and the quality of products will have a basic guarantee. However, it should be seen that quality is a complex issue, and one must never think that everything will be fine with an inspection system. The inspection system cannot directly solve some specific and key problems affecting quality encountered in the operation process. To solve these problems, it is also necessary to rely on the combination of production workers, technical personnel, and leading cadres to conduct specific research on the labor site, conduct in-depth analysis, and then prescribe the right medicine to solve the problems. The problem of excessive water content in the Dong Anshan concentrate and the problem of the excessive scrap rate of gears in the Beijing Lifting Machinery Factory were both solved through the form of the "three combinations."

The improvement and enhancement of product quality involves many aspects: there are practical operational problems, technical theoretical problems, and also people's ideological awareness and ideological methods. Relying solely on technical personnel or only relying on the experience of a few people to deal with this problem is often prone to one-sidedness and difficult to solve satisfactorily. Therefore, when leading cadres, technical personnel, and all relevant production workers go to the labor site and face the products, the problem is concentrated, the goal is clear, and it is easier to solve the problem. Because workers directly engaged in production are familiar with the production equipment and have rich practical experience, they will all put forward a large number of specific and practical opinions; technical personnel, who are not as familiar with the production situation as the workers but have a higher level of technical theory, can explain many problems from a technical and theoretical point of view. The personal participation of leading cadres can give full play to the expertise of workers and technical personnel, discern the situation, and make decisions in a timely manner. In this way, the causes of the problem can be revealed more deeply and comprehensively; the measures and methods formulated are also easier to conform to reality and be practical and feasible, and are understood by all workers. This can greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the masses.

"Specific problems must be specifically analyzed." Doing a good job in inspection in all aspects of production is the fundamental aspect of ensuring quality; "three combinations" on-site consultations by leading cadres, technical personnel, and production workers to concentrate the wisdom of the people on key quality issues, thereby making specific measures to improve quality, this is another aspect. If we firmly grasp these two aspects and do a good job in political and ideological work, then we can be sure that the quality of our products will be excellent.

    把住这一关
    雨丰
    产品质量优良，人民欢迎，国家满意，生产单位也可因此更好地达到增产节约的目的。反之，产品质量不好，不仅直接浪费原材料、工时，使成本增高，而且还给使用部门造成浪费和麻烦。因此，在增产节约运动中，紧紧把住产品质量这一关，就显得十分重要。
    怎样把好这一关？最重要的一条就是严格执行从原料、材料、半成品直到成品的质量检验制度。原材料进厂固然要有专人负责检验，产品出厂也要有专人负责检验。而生产过程中每个部件和零件是否合乎规格，更需要注意检验。如果每个厂把一进一出的两个关口都掌管好，同时又把当中一段管好，那末，次品就不能随便进出，产品质量就有了基本保证。但是，应当看到质量问题是个复杂的问题，绝不能以为有了检验制度，一切就万事大吉了。检验制度并不能直接解决操作过程中碰到的一些影响质量的具体问题和关键问题。要解决这部分问题，还需要依靠生产工人、技术人员、领导干部三方面结合起来，到劳动现场具体研究，深刻分析，然后对症下药，解决问题。东鞍山精矿含水量过高的问题，北京起重机器厂齿轮废品率过大的问题，都是通过三结合的形式解决的。
    产品质量的改进和提高，涉及的方面很多：有实际操作问题，有技术理论问题，也有人们的思想意识和思想方法问题。光靠技术人员，或者只凭借少数人的经验来处理这个问题，常常容易失之片面，难以圆满解决。所以，领导干部、技术人员和全体有关生产工人，到劳动现场，面对产品，就使问题集中，目标明确，解决问题也就比较容易。因为直接从事生产的工人熟悉生产设备情况，有丰富实际操作经验，他们人人都会提出大量的具体实际的意见；对生产情况不如工人熟悉，而技术理论水平较高的技术人员，可以对很多问题从技术理论上加以说明。领导干部的亲自参加，可以充分发挥工人和技术人员的特长，辨别情况，及时作出决定。这样，就使问题发生的原因，能够比较深刻、全面地被揭发出来；订出的措施办法，也易于符合实际，切实可行，并且为全体工人所了解。这就可以大大鼓舞群众的积极性。
    “具体问题必须具体的分析”，在生产各个环节里做好检验，是保证质量的根本方面；领导干部、技术人员和生产工人“三结合”现场会诊，针对质量关键问题集中众人智谋，从而作出提高质量的具体措施，这又是一个方面。紧紧抓住这两个方面，并且做好政治思想工作，那末，我们的产品质量可以确有把握地达到是优等的。
