Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The Czechoslovak Trade Union held its Fourth National Congress in Prague from May 13th to 17th.

The main task of this congress was to summarize the work of the trade union since the Third National Congress and to discuss the tasks of the trade union during the period of socialist construction.

More than 1,600 delegates and 42 trade union delegations from 39 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as Marcel Brass, Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, attended the congress.

Chairman of the Central Council of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, Mr. Supka, delivered the main report at the congress. He pointed out that since the Third National Congress in 1955, the trade union has made great achievements in implementing the principle of "trade union leadership approaching factories and enhancing the power of grassroots trade union organizations," in leading the masses to complete and overfulfill national production tasks, and in caring for the lives and welfare of the working people.

Speaking of the tasks of the trade union in completing socialist construction, Supka said that carrying out communist education among the working people and continuously expanding the ranks of highly conscious socialist builders is the most important task of the trade union in the future.

Supka pointed out that currently, as many as 4,000 collectives are participating in the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team." The trade union should vigorously support and ensure the widespread development of this competition.

The Czechoslovak Trade Union has 4 million members, an increase of 360,000 since the Third National Congress. The congress began on the 14th to discuss the main report made to the congress by Chairman of the Central Council of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, Mr. Supka. A delegation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, headed by Czechoslovak President and First Secretary of the Central Committee, Mr. Novotny, attended the morning session on the 14th. The delegation included all members of the Communist Party's Politburo. President Novotny spoke at the meeting. He said that the main content of the trade union's entire activity at present lies in developing the creative forces of the people and in concentrating their forces on decisive tasks to complete socialist construction. President Novotny said that it is very realistic to expect that Czechoslovakia will be able to begin the transition to communist construction in the next ten years. President Novotny said that, to this end, it is necessary to develop the national economy. The basis for doing so is to maximize the use of all kinds of enormous reserves, improve product quality, rapidly increase social labor productivity, and adopt the latest technologies, automation, mechanization, large-scale specialization, and cooperation in production. In his speech, President Novotny warmly welcomed the exemplary initiative of the teams striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team."

President Novotny concluded by saying that only by developing socialist democracy and allowing the working people to participate in the administrative work of the country and the guidance of the economy can we guarantee the rapid development of the new socialist society and the all-round development of people.

Xi Zhanyuan, head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation, also spoke at the meeting on the morning of the 14th.

He said that the Chinese working class is very pleased to see the achievements made by the fraternal Czechoslovak working class and the significant contributions you have made in strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, strengthening the unity of the international workers' movement, opposing the imperialist policies of war and aggression, and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. Your achievements are a great encouragement to the people of our country who are engaged in socialist construction.

During the four days of discussions, the delegates who spoke unanimously stated that the Czechoslovak Trade Union, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, will contribute all its strength to completing socialist construction and promoting the further development of the national economy. The delegates also fully discussed issues such as strengthening the communist and socialist education of the working people by the trade union, extensively carrying out socialist labor competitions, and strengthening care for the welfare of the working people.

This congress paid special attention to the decentralization of trade union rights and the full play and expansion of the trade union's role in strengthening the socialist democratic life of the working people.

The resolution adopted by the congress pointed out the specific ways to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of production tasks. The resolution said that the competition for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" should be guided to a higher level, so that it can play a more significant role in completing production plans, improving workers' technical skills and political awareness. The resolution also emphasized the importance of mobilizing the masses to extensively carry out the technical innovation movement.

In terms of strengthening the socialist ideological education of the working people, the resolution pointed out that all education conducted by the trade union for the masses should have a high degree of ideological content, and first of all, the Marxist-Leninist education of the working people should be strengthened to oppose all bourgeois ideas and behaviors. The resolution pointed out that the form of comrade trial meetings should be widely used to educate those who violate the principles of socialist life.

The resolution also called on trade unions at all levels to vigorously help agricultural production cooperatives, and to regard helping peasants achieve decisive changes in agriculture as their important task.

This congress revised the trade union charter. The revised charter emphasized the importance of the Party's leadership over the trade union, and listed strengthening the communist and socialist education of the working people and mobilizing the masses to fully complete the country's economic plans as the primary tasks of the trade union. In the new charter, more specific and clear provisions were made for the decentralization of trade union rights.

The congress elected a new Central Council and Inspection Committee of the trade union, and passed a letter to the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party and the Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva.

    诺沃提尼强调组织群众完成社会主义建设
    本报综合报道　据新华社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克工会于13日至17日在布拉格召开了第四届全国代表大会。
    这次大会的主要任务是总结第三届全国代表大会以来的工会工作，并讨论工会在完成社会主义建设时期的任务。
    出席这次代表大会的有一千六百多名代表和来自欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的三十九个国家的四十二个工会代表团以及世界工会联合会书记马塞尔·布拉等人。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席苏普卡在大会上作了主要报告。他指出，从1955年第三届代表大会以来，工会在贯彻“工会领导接近工厂和提高基层工会组织权力”的原则方面、在领导群众完成和超额完成国家生产任务以及关心劳动人民生活福利等方面都做出了巨大的成绩。
    谈到工会在完成社会主义建设时期中的任务时苏普卡说，对劳动人民进行共产主义教育，并不断扩大有高度觉悟的社会主义建设者的行列，是工会工作今后最重要的任务。
    苏普卡指出，目前参加争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛的集体已达四千个。工会应大力支持和保证这一竞赛的广泛开展。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会现有四百万会员，比第三届代表大会时增加了三十六万人。代表大会于14日开始讨论捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席苏普卡向大会作的主要报告。以捷克斯洛伐克总统和中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团出席了14日上午的会议。代表团包括共产党政治局的全体委员。诺沃提尼总统在会议上讲了话。他说，当前工会整个活动的主要内容在于发展人民的创造性力量，在于把他们的力量集中在决定性的任务上，以完成社会主义建设。诺沃提尼总统说，如果预料我们捷克斯洛伐克将在今后十年内就能够开始过渡到共产主义建设，这是很现实的。诺沃提尼总统说，为此，必须发展国民经济。这样做的基础是最大限度地利用各种巨大的储备，改善产品质量，迅速地提高社会劳动生产率，在生产中采用最新技术，自动化，机械化，大规模专业化和合作。诺沃提尼总统在讲话中热烈地欢迎了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的小队的典范性倡议。
    诺沃提尼总统最后说，只有发展社会主义民主，让劳动人民参加国家的行政工作和经济的指导工作，才能保证新的社会主义社会迅速发展和人的全面发展。
    中国工会代表团团长郗占元也在14日上午的会议上讲了话。
    他说，中国工人阶级十分高兴的看到兄弟般的捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级所获得的这些成就以及您们在加强社会主义阵营的团结、加强国际工人运动的团结、反对帝国主义的战争和侵略政策、维护欧洲和世界和平的事业中所作出的重大贡献。您们的成就对正在进行社会主义建设的我国人民是个莫大的鼓舞。
    在四天的讨论中，发言的代表们一致表示，捷克斯洛伐克工会将在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下为完成社会主义建设、促进国民经济的进一步发展而贡献一切力量。代表们并对加强工会对劳动人民的共产主义和社会主义教育、广泛开展社会主义劳动竞赛以及加强对劳动人民福利的关怀等问题进行了充分的讨论。
    这次大会对工会的权利下放和充分发挥与扩大工会在加强劳动人民社会主义民主生活中的作用等问题给予了特别的注意。
    大会通过的决议指出了工会在保证生产任务完成和超额完成方面的具体途径。决议说，应将争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛引导到更高的水平，使之在完成生产计划、提高工人技术水平和政治觉悟方面发挥更显著的作用。决议也强调了发动群众广泛开展技术革新运动的重要意义。
    在加强对劳动人民的社会主义思想教育方面，决议指出，工会对群众所进行的全部教育都应具有高度的思想性，首先应加强对劳动人民的马克思列宁主义教育，反对一切资产阶级的思想和行为。决议指出应广泛运用同志审判会的形式去教育那些违反社会主义生活原则的人。
    决议并要求各级工会大力帮助农业生产合作社，把帮助农民在农业中取得决定性的转变看作是自己的重要任务。
    这次大会对工会章程进行了修改。修改过的章程强调了党对工会领导的重要性，并把加强对劳动人民的共产主义和社会主义教育、发动群众全面完成国家的经济计划列为工会的首要任务。在新的章程中，对工会权利下放作了更加具体明确的规定。
    大会选举了新的工会中央理事会和检查委员会，并通过了给捷共中央和日内瓦外长会议的信。
