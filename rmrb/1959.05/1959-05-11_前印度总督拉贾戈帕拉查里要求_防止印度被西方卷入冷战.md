Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 9th. Former Governor-General of India, Rajagopalachari, published an article in today's English-language weekly "Swarajya," pointing out that "Western countries are sparing no effort to affirm and emphasize that Indian public opinion (on the Tibetan issue) favors their views. This situation requires great caution."

He said that India should prevent itself from being drawn into the Cold War over the Tibet issue. He believes that "our struggle is against the Cold War, not against one side or the other of the two blocs."

The Dravida Kazhagam party's organ "Liberation" (Tamil), a South Indian separatist group, published an article on May 7th, calling for a rational approach to the situation in Tibet.

The article stated, "India cannot have any different path other than the path determined by wisdom and understanding. Both tell us that the so-called 'national uprising' in Tibet is neither national in nature nor any real uprising. It is only a weak and powerless activity by some predatory and reactionary lamas trying to resist the progressive and egalitarian new order proposed by the Chinese."

The article called on the Indian people to "not sympathize with the reactionary rebels (in Tibet)."

    前印度总督拉贾戈帕拉查里要求
    防止印度被西方卷入冷战
    新华社新德里9日电　前印度总督拉贾戈帕拉查里在今天的英文“独立”周刊上发表文章指出，“西方国家正在不遗余力地肯定和强调印度舆论（在西藏事件上）有利于它们的观点。这种形势要求人们非常谨慎。
    他说，印度应该防止在西藏问题上被卷入冷战。他认为，“我们的斗争是反对冷战，而不是反对两个集团中的一方或另一方。”
    南印度分离派的德拉维达·卡扎加姆党的机关报“解放报”（泰米尔文）5月7日发表文章，要求人们有理性地对待西藏的局势。
    文章说，“除了智慧和理解所决定的道路，印度不能有任何不同的道路。这两者都告诉我们，西藏的所谓‘民族起义’在性质上既不是民族的，而且也不是任何真正的起义。它只是一些掠夺成性的反动喇嘛要想抗拒中国人建议采取的进步平等的新秩序的软弱无力的活动。”
    文章要求印度人民“不要同情（西藏）反动的叛乱分子”。
