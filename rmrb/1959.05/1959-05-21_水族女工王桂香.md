    Shui Ethnic Female Worker Wang Guixiang
    By our reporter Lu Xinglun
    Beside the workbench of the fitter group in the metalworking workshop of the Sandu Shui Autonomous County Machinery Factory, Wang Guixiang is rushing to assemble deep plows. She holds the shiny "die stock" tightly clasped onto the iron nails with both hands, concentrating on twisting the screws; sometimes she looks up at the new female workers around her to see if they are working smoothly. Twisting screws like this, Wang Guixiang has increased her output from the original twenty to thirty screws per day to one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty. She can generally complete eleven to twelve plows per day, exceeding the factory's quota of seven per person per day.
    During the autumn harvest of 1958, this daughter of a Shui ethnic poor peasant, a Communist Party member, put down her familiar farm tools and stepped into the factory gate according to the needs of the state. When she first saw the piles of iron plates and machinery such as generators and motors in the factory, she was both excited and nervous. She looked at her hands, "Can I do such work well?" Without time to think, she started her first day of work—filing nails. Wang Guixiang filed as hard as she would when doing farm work, but because she didn't understand the technique and the file was old and dull, she couldn't file properly. Her hands were sore, but the nails still didn't meet the standards. She could only file a few, and the day was over. Wang Guixiang was very anxious.
    The factory's Party and government leaders provided her with timely help and encouragement. Soon after Wang Guixiang arrived at the workshop, Wang Huamin, the Party branch secretary and factory director, heard that she was using an old file and immediately came to the workshop to see her. In a situation where tools were insufficient, he replaced it with a brand new file for her and encouraged her to study hard and overcome difficulties. After that, whenever Comrade Wang Huamin came to the workshop, he would always check on what Wang Guixiang was doing. When administrative affairs were not too pressing, he would even help her twist screws. Several Han Chinese female workers who had entered the factory more than a month earlier also often cooperated and exchanged experiences with her during work or breaks.
    With enthusiastic help, Wang Guixiang was determined to study the technique. With the warm and selfless help of the Han Chinese master worker Wu Wenming, she made rapid progress. She was equally enthusiastic in helping other workers. Several female workers in her group could only complete fifty to sixty screws per day, and their efficiency was very low. Wang Guixiang discovered that their problem was that the "die stock" was not tightly fastened. Under her guidance, they improved their operation, and now they have increased their output to about one hundred screws.
    Under the situation of the Shui people launching a great production upsurge, in order to improve the quantity and quality of products, the Sandu Shui Autonomous County Machinery Factory put forward the slogan of old workers leading new workers. With the support of the factory Party branch and the continued help of master worker Wu Wenming, Wang Guixiang led a newly arrived male worker and has successfully completed the installation of a native lathe.
    Recently, Wang Guixiang was named a model worker in the machinery factory. She said: "This is entirely due to the Party's cultivation and the help of the Han Chinese master worker."

    水族女工王桂香

    在三都水族自治县机械厂金工车间钳工组的工作台旁，王桂香正赶装深耕犁。她两手握着紧扣在铁钉上的光亮的“丝板”，全神贯注地扭着螺丝钉；有时她抬起头来望望周围的几个新女工，看她们的工作是否顺利。干扭螺丝这种活，王桂香已经从原来每天只能完成二十到三十颗的情况，提高到一百一十到一百二十颗。装犁，她一般每天能完成十一到十二架，超过了厂里制定的每人每天七架的定额。
    1958年秋收的时候，这位水族贫农的女儿、共产党员，根据国家需要，放下熟习了的农具，跨进了工厂的大门。当她第一次看见厂里成堆的铁板和发电机、马达等机器设备时，既兴奋又紧张，她望望自己的双手，“我能做好这样的工作吗？”她来不及多想就开始了第一天的工作——锉钉子。王桂香像干农活一样使劲地锉，可是一来不懂技术，二来锉刀老得没牙齿，总是锉不动。手都弄痛了，还是不合规格，锉不到几颗，一天就过去了。王桂香心里很焦急。
    工厂党政领导及时对她进行了帮助和鼓励。王桂香下车间不久，厂党支部书记、厂长王化民同志听说她用的是一把老锉刀，立即亲自下车间来看，在工具不足的情况下，换了一把全新的锉刀给她使用，并鼓励她努力学习，克服困难。以后，王化民同志来到车间，总要看看王桂香作些什么，当行政事务不太紧的时候，有时还帮助她扭螺丝钉。比她早一个多月进厂的几个汉族女工，也常在工作或休息时和她互相协作和交流经验。
    王桂香在热情帮助下下，定了决心钻研技术。在汉族老师傅伍文明热情无私的帮助下，进步很快。她对别的工人也同样热心帮助。和她同组的几个女工，原来扭螺丝钉每天只能完成五十到六十颗，效率很低。王桂香发现她们存在的问题是“丝板”没扣紧，在她的指导下改进了操作，现在已经提高到一百颗左右。
    在水族人民掀起大生产高潮的形势下，为了提高产品数量和质量，三都水族自治县机械厂提出老学工带领新学工的口号，王桂香得到工厂党支部的支持和在伍文明老师傅的继续帮助下，带领着一个新进厂的男工，已经顺利地完成了一部土车床的安装工作。
    最近，王桂香在机械厂里被评为劳动模范，她说：“这完全是党的培养和汉族老师傅的帮助。”
