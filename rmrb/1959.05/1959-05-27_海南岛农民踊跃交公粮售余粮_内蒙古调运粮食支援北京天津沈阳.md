Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 24th. While starting to harvest early rice, the peasants of Hainan Island have launched a surge of handing over public grain and selling surplus grain. By the 18th, 4.3 million jin of new grain had been stored in the granaries across the island. In Ya County, where the harvest season started earlier, 3 million jin of new grain have already been stored. These days, on the large and small roads leading to the state granaries, gongs and drums are sounding all day long, and the teams delivering grain are constantly coming and going.

    Having obtained their first bumper harvest since communization, the peasants of Hainan Island are highly enthusiastic about handing over and selling summer grain. After harvesting the first batch of early rice, the Wanzhong Brigade of the Changzheng Commune in Qiongzhong County immediately organized commune members to thresh and dry the grain, and raced to transport public grain and surplus grain into the granaries, winning the first place in the county for handing over and selling summer grain. On May 13, the Tengqiao Commune mobilized more than 1,000 commune members and five trucks, and transported 120,000 jin of new grain to the state granaries in one day. The Wenpo Brigade of the Jiaji Commune and the Futang Brigade of the Longgun Commune in Qionghai County also completed the task of storing summer public grain in one go in one day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 26th. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which achieved a great agricultural harvest last year, has already transported 270,000 tons of miscellaneous grains to supply Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places. From now until the end of June, another 130,000 tons of grain will be transported.

    In order to speed up the grain transportation work, the people's communes in the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia have dispatched a large number of vehicles to collect and transport grain to the railway lines.

    Grain departments at all levels in the autonomous region have also assigned a group of cadres to participate in the grain transfer work.

    内蒙古调运粮食支援北京天津沈阳
    新华社广州24日电  海南岛农民在开始收割早稻的同时，掀起了交售公粮和余粮的热潮。到18日止，全岛已有四百三十万斤新谷进仓。收获季节较早的崖县，进仓新谷已达三百万斤。这几天，在通往国家的粮仓的大小路上，整天锣鼓喧天，送粮的队伍络绎不绝。
    获得公社化以后第一次丰收的海南岛农民，交售夏粮的情绪十分高涨。琼中县长征公社万众大队在收割第一批早稻后，立即组织社员打场晾晒，争先将公粮和余粮运送入仓，争得了全县交售夏粮的第一名。藤桥公社在5月13日一天内，出动了一千多名社员和五部汽车，将十二万斤新谷运送到国家粮仓。琼海县加积公社文坡大队和龙滚公社福塘大队也都是一鼓作气，在一天内完成了夏季公粮入仓任务。
    新华社呼和浩特26日电  去年取得农业大丰收的内蒙古自治区，今年已经运出二十七万吨杂粮，供应北京、天津、沈阳等地。从现在到6月底，还将运出粮食十三万吨。
    内蒙古农业区的人民公社，为了加速运粮工作，出动了大量车辆，把粮食向铁路沿线集运。
    自治区各级粮食部门也抽出一批干部参加粮食调运工作。
