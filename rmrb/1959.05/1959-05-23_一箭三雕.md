    Killing Three Birds with One Stone
    He Changhua
    Currently, some production units are facing difficulties due to insufficient supply of certain raw materials and materials. This is because there is an imbalance in the production and distribution of certain raw materials and materials. To resolve this contradiction, in addition to striving to increase production, conscientiously conserving, and finding more substitutes, there is another aspect that cannot be ignored: mobilizing the masses to clear warehouses.
    Clearing warehouses is by no means a passive measure. It can achieve mutual exchange of needed goods, make the best use of materials, and unleash the power of potential materials. What is unusable to you, stagnating in the warehouse, may be precisely the material that is suitable for others; what is surplus to others may be precisely the material that you lack. Turning dead materials into living materials is the main purpose of clearing warehouses.
    However, some people have different views on tapping potential materials. They believe that if certain materials are insufficient, they should be used "sparingly" and not used up all at once. Obviously, they have not seen that putting the materials in the warehouse into the most urgently needed production areas in a timely manner can fundamentally change the situation of insufficient raw materials and materials.
    Therefore, clearing warehouses is an education in establishing the idea of the whole country as one chessboard, and an education in promoting the communist style. Some comrades, especially those engaged in supply and marketing work, have a feeling of "being afraid of being transferred" and "reluctance to part with" during the movement. Usually, for the production of their own enterprises, they go to great lengths to purchase materials everywhere. Now, once they are to be transferred, it is easy to have this kind of emotion. However, as long as they are patiently told the truth of "the overall situation comes before the partial situation," they will be able to happily accept the task of material allocation and be able to actively participate in the work of clearing warehouses.
    Some people may also say: We clear the warehouses every year, and there is not much left. However, the results of warehouse clearing in many units have proved that there is a lot left. This is because they do not understand that the storage situation of materials is changing every day. In the process of clearing warehouses, many units not only got a clear picture of their inventory, but also discovered many loopholes in the enterprise's material management and supply work, such as blind procurement, "roadside warehouses" with no one in charge, goods without accounts, fewer accounts than goods, and no formal receiving and issuing procedures, etc., thereby further improving and establishing raw material management systems.
    There are many benefits to clearing warehouses. It is beneficial to developing production, improving ideology, and improving enterprise management. It can truly be said to be killing three birds with one stone. Since this is the case, why not do it?

    一箭三雕
    贺昌华
    当前有些生产单位遇到部分原料、材料供应不足的困难，这是由于某些原料、材料在生产和分配上存在着不平衡。要解决这个矛盾，除了努力增加生产、认真节约和多多寻找代用品以外，还有一个不可忽视的方面，就是发动群众清理仓库。
    清仓决不是一项消极的措施。它可以做到互通有无、物尽其用，发挥潜在物资的力量。在你那里是不合用的物资，呆滞在仓库里，说不定对别人正是合用的物资；在别人那里是多余的物资，说不定对你正是缺少的物资。化死物资为活物资，这正是清仓的主要目的。
    但有人对挖掘潜在物资，却有着不同的看法，他们认为：某些物资既是不足，就应该“细水长流”不要一下用掉。这显然他没有看到，及时将仓库里的物资，用到最急需的生产方面，才可以从根本改变原料、材料不足的情况。
    所以清仓是一次树立全国一盘棋思想的教育，是一次发扬共产主义风格的教育。有一部分同志，特别是做供销工作的同志，在运动中有一种“怕调走”、“舍不得”的情绪。平时，他们为了本企业的生产，千辛万苦到处采购物资，现在一旦要调走，发生这种情绪也是容易理解的。但是，只要向他们耐心地讲清“先有大局然后才有小局”的道理，他们是能够愉快地接受物资调拨任务，并能够积极投入清理仓库的工作的。
    也有人会说：年年清仓，油水不大了。但许多单位清仓的结果证明却是油水很多。这是因为他们不了解，物资储存的情况是天天变化的。许多单位在清仓中不仅摸清了家底，还发现了本企业物资管理和供应工作上的很多漏洞，如盲目采购，无人管的“马路仓库”，有货无账，账少物多，没有正规的收料发料手续，等等，从而进一步健全和建立了原材料管理制度。
    清仓的好处很多，对发展生产、提高思想和改善企业管理都有好处，真可谓一箭三雕。既是如此，何乐而不为。
