Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th. After criticizing the theory of wheat being a "foregone conclusion," Lai'an County, Anhui Province, has universally strengthened the late-stage management of wheat fields in various people's communes.

Lai'an County is located near the Yangtze River. The county's more than 300,000 mu of wheat is currently in the heading and flowering stage. The wheat waves are rolling, and the growth is good. Some commune members saw this situation and thought that a good wheat harvest was a foregone conclusion, and there was no need to strengthen management anymore. In order to thoroughly criticize this idea, all communes organized the masses to carry out open discussions and debates on issues such as "Is wheat a foregone conclusion?", "Can a good harvest be guaranteed without further management?", and "How to strengthen management?". During the debates, many commune members cited examples of reduced wheat production in previous years due to relaxed late-stage management and the suffering of rust, as well as the situation in 1958 where some places, despite severe rust, still ensured a good wheat harvest because of strengthened late-stage management, refuting the "foregone conclusion" theory.

On the basis of unified understanding, the people's communes throughout the county organized more than 20,000 people to form specialized teams for late-stage wheat field management, to carry out foliar fertilization and rust prevention for wheat. The whole county also formed 280 inspection teams composed of cadres at all levels, experienced farmers, and activists to conduct a general inspection of wheat fields. The inspection team of Tuncang People's Commune found that the humidity of wheat seedlings was high, and immediately mobilized commune members to ditch all wheat fields once, and sprinkled plant ash on some fields. Huangying Production Team of Banta Commune discovered that seven mu of wheat fields had slight rust, and immediately organized ten commune members to put it out. They sprayed pesticides twice a day and completely eliminated the rust within three days. Due to the intensive late-stage management, the wheat in the whole county is growing better and better.

### 及时进行根外施肥和防治锈病  来安县小麦愈长愈好

　　及时进行根外施肥和防治锈病
    来安县小麦愈长愈好
    新华社合肥9日电　安徽省来安县批判了小麦定局论后，各地人民公社普遍加强了麦田后期管理工作。
    来安县临近长江，这个县的三十多万亩小麦目前正在抽穗扬花，麦浪翻滚，生长情况良好。有些社员看到这种情况就认为小麦丰收已成定局，用不着再加强管理了。为了彻底批判这种思想，各公社都组织群众就“小麦是不是定局了”“不再管理能不能保证丰收”“怎样加强管理”等问题开展鸣放辩论。在辩论中，很多社员列举了往年因放松后期管理，使小麦遭受锈病而减产的例子，以及1958年有的地方虽然锈病很严重，因为加强了后期管理，仍保证了小麦丰收的情况，驳倒了“定局论”。
    在统一认识的基础上，全县人民公社组织了二万多人成立麦田后期管理专业队，给小麦进行根外积肥和防治锈病。全县还由各级干部、老农、积极分子组成二百八十个检查组，对麦田进行了普遍检查。屯仓人民公社检查组发现麦苗湿度较大，便立即发动社员将所有麦田全部抽沟一次，并在一部分田里撒了草木灰。半塔公社黄郢生产队发现七亩麦田有轻微的锈病，立即组织十名社员进行扑灭，一天喷二遍农药，三天内就把锈病完全消灭了。由于抓紧了后期管理，全县小麦越长越好。（附图片）
