Jiangxi Speeds Up Outward Transfer of Coal and Iron to Support Shanghai and Wuhan

(Our Nanchang Dispatch, 11th) Jiangxi is accelerating the transfer of coal and pig iron to support key enterprises in Shanghai and Wuhan Iron and Steel Works. The amount of coal and pig iron transferred in March and April increased more than twofold compared to January and February. So far this year, the province has transferred 530,000 tons of raw coal, 90,000 tons of washed fine coal, and more than 30,000 tons of pig iron to Shanghai, Wuhan, and other locations.

Prior to March, the province had only transferred 170,000 tons of raw coal and 9,000 tons of pig iron, and the upward transfer task was not well completed. After discovering this situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee held several telephone conferences, repeatedly pointing out the important significance of supporting key national enterprises. At the same time, it pointed out that an important reason for the poor completion of the upward transfer task in the previous stage was the lack of attention to transportation work. It required local Party committees to strengthen leadership over transportation work, designate local industrial secretaries to take charge, and organize a massive campaign to expedite the transfer. Subsequently, a red banner emulation movement of "boats chasing floods, sailing day and night, and vehicles racing against time, rushing to transport in double shifts" was launched across the region to expedite the transfer of iron and coal to support key national enterprises. Shangrao Prefecture mobilized a large number of vehicles and ships, adopting a combination of water and land transport for the assault. In just a few days, Leping County alone transferred 140,000 tons of coal. The highways in Yichun Prefecture have many slopes and curves, and it was generally believed that automobiles could not pull trailers. This time, the staff of the highway transportation department tried every means to overcome numerous difficulties and finally realized the trailerization of automobiles, increasing the transport capacity by more than two times and overfulfilling the iron and coal upward transfer tasks for March and April. According to the characteristics of few highway branches and difficult short-distance transportation, the people's communes in the southern Jiangxi region organized more than 30,000 laborers, added 20,000 handcarts, and organized more than 400 specialized transportation teams to transport pig iron and coal to the banks of the Gan River and major highway trunk lines in a timely manner.

In order to ensure the completion of the coal and pig iron transportation tasks, the railway workers in Jiangxi actively promoted road-mine collaboration and successfully completed the upward transfer transportation tasks.

In the process of transferring pig iron and coal, various places demonstrated a high degree of communist spirit. The people's communes in Shangyou County originally planned to retain 300 tons of gray iron for their own use. After deeply publicizing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," the people's communes transferred all the retained pig iron to Shanghai. When pig iron could not be concentrated in Jiujiang Prefecture for a while, the prefectural committee transferred 700 tons of iron, which was originally prepared for steelmaking, to Shanghai to ensure the steelmaking needs of key enterprises. In addition, all of the more than 90,000 tons of washed fine coal produced in the province were transferred to Wuhan Iron and Steel.

### 江西加紧外调煤铁支援上海武汉

    江西加紧外调煤铁支援上海武汉
    本报南昌11日电  江西各地加紧调运煤炭、生铁支援上海和武钢等重点企业，3、4月份上调煤炭、生铁比1、2月份猛增一倍以上。到目前为止，全省今年调往上海、武汉等地的原煤已达五十三万吨，洗精粉九万吨，生铁三万多吨。
    3月份以前，全省只调出原煤十七万吨和生铁九千吨，上调任务完成的不好。中共江西省委发现这种情况以后，连续召开了几次电话会议，一再指出支援国家重点企业的重要意义，同时指出前一阶段上调任务完成不好的一个重要原因是对运输工作抓的不紧，要求各地党委加强对运输工作的领导，指定各地工业书记挂帅，组织千军万马突击调运。接着，一个“船赶洪水，昼夜航行，车争分秒，双班抢运”的突击调运铁、煤支援国家重点企业的红旗竞赛运动便在各地展开了。上饶地区抽调了大批车、船，采取水陆并进的方法进行突击，几天内，仅乐平县就调运出十四万吨煤炭。宜春地区的公路多坡多弯，一向认为汽车不能带拖车。这次公路运输部门的职工想尽各种办法，突破重重难关，终于实现了汽车拖车化，使运量提高到两倍以上，超额完成了3、4月份铁、煤上调任务。赣南地区的人民公社根据本地公路支线不多，短途运输困难的特点，组织三万多个劳动力，添置两万部手推车，又组织四百多个专业运输队，及时将生铁、煤炭运到赣江两岸和主要公路干线。
    为了保证完成煤炭、生铁运输任务，江西境内的铁路职工大搞路矿协作，很好地完成了上调运输任务。
    在这次调运生铁、煤炭的过程中，各地发挥了高度的共产主义风格。上犹县各人民公社原拟留三百吨灰口铁自用，在深入宣传全国一盘棋的方针以后，各人民公社便将全部留用生铁调给上海。九江专区在上调生铁一时不能集中起来的时候，地委便将准备留着炼钢用的七百吨铁，调往上海，保证重点企业炼钢需要。此外，全省所生产的九万多吨洗精粉，全部调给了武钢。
