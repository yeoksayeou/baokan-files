How "Enemies" Became Comrades-in-Arms
Cheng Zhi

In the paint and carpentry workshop of the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard, two carpentry teams were engaged in a competition. One was the Liu Tingdong team, and the other was the Zhang Xincai team. During the competition, the two teams were "evenly matched." "You wanted to overwhelm me, and I wanted to overwhelm you. Championship mentality took over." As a result, they became like "needles against wheat awns, like enemies meeting on a narrow road." (See "Chinese Worker," Issue 9)

This made things a bit bad. For example, the Liu Tingdong team was responsible for the assembly of fishing boats and was busy in the first half of the month; while the Zhang Xincai team worked on another ship and was busy in the second half of the month. If the two teams cooperated and supported each other, they could both complete their tasks easily and happily. But both teams only cared about "fighting alone," "preferring to work overtime when they were busy rather than asking others for help." Some people advised them to cooperate. One team said, "It's spineless to ask for help!" The other team said, "What kind of competition would it be if we helped?" The result was naturally that they couldn't come together.

Even worse, when the two teams met, they were all smiles on the surface, but each had their own calculations in their hearts. "When Lao Chen of the Liu Tingdong team saw Lao Li of the Zhang Xincai team walking up the gangplank, he immediately ordered, 'Attention, the scout is here.' Then, the innovative tools were immediately put away." The Zhang Xincai team improved the deck caulking method, shortening the work by two days. Lao Chen of the Liu Tingdong team then "secretly pried open the deck to take a look."

Later, after education from the Party organization (naturally, there was a detailed process, which is omitted here), "the relationship improved, and they no longer distrusted each other." They also signed a "Red Flag Competition Agreement." As a result, advanced operating methods were made public, innovative tools were shared, production enthusiasm was newly encouraged, and the pace of production increased linearly. Thus, "enemies" became comrades-in-arms.

There were two instances of friendly cooperation: One afternoon, the Liu Tingdong team was caulking the deck when a heavy rain suddenly threatened. If they couldn't finish that day, the rain that night would delay the work by at least two days, and the quality couldn't be guaranteed. Zhang Xincai immediately sent Li Zhifa, leading three comrades with tools, to support the Liu Tingdong team in caulking. At this time, the comrades of the Liu Tingdong team were anxious and worried. When they saw the reinforcements arrive, they were overjoyed.

Another instance was: The Zhang Xincai team was working on the masts, and the next process was pressing them urgently. It was almost time to get off work, but there was still a large part left unfinished. Liu Tingdong also promptly sent Lao Chen with several comrades to help. When Zhang Xincai saw Chen Qinghua, he gratefully said, "Great, you've come to our rescue."

I think everyone will draw a conclusion from this story without me having to say it: How to act is beneficial to the country and to both teams; how to act is harmful to the country and to both teams. What's worth discussing, however, is why the two teams couldn't see such a simple and clear thing before? Why couldn't they be persuaded or dissuaded even when others tried?

Simply put, it was nothing else but the "championship mentality" that veiled their eyes. Just look at their face-to-face self-criticism to understand:

Liu Tingdong: "Using the competition to elevate ourselves and attack others, we completely fell into the stinking pit of capitalism! Individual heroism is really harmful!"

Zhang Xincai: "Yes, someone pointed out to me at the time that this was individual heroism, and I was still unconvinced. I thought that winning glory for the team was for the collective, wasn't it?"

The old Chen who pried open the deck said: "My past act of secretly prying open the deck was so despicable and selfish. When I think about it now, my face burns..."

This is a sincere and profound self-criticism. This kind of self-criticism promoted the working class's conscious spirit of these comrades, tore off the bourgeois veil covering their faces, and revealed the true color of the working class's shining face. I think that the reason why active criticism and self-criticism are indispensable weapons of the working class lies here; and one of the contents of the Party's political and ideological work is to constantly inspire this consciousness in people!

    “冤家”怎样变成了战友
    承之
    上海求新造船厂漆木车间，有两个木工小组进行竞赛。一个是柳廷栋小组，一个是张信才小组。在竞赛中，两个组“旗鼓相当，势均力敌”。“你想压倒我，我想压倒你。锦标思想占了上风。”因此弄得“针尖对麦芒，好像狭路相逢的冤家”。（见第九期“中国工人”）
    这样一来，事情可就有点儿不妙。比如，柳廷栋小组担任渔轮装配任务，上半月紧张；而张信才小组在另一个船上工作，却是下半个月忙。如果两组协作，互相支援，都能轻松愉快地完成任务。但两家却都只顾“孤军奋战”，“紧张时宁愿加班，也不肯找别人帮忙。”有人劝他们互相协作。一家说：“要人家相帮没志气！”另一家说：“去帮忙，还成什么竞赛？”结果自然是凑不拢来。
    还有更糟的事：两组的人一见面，表面上嘻嘻哈哈，但心里却各有算计。“柳廷栋小组的老陈看见张信才小组的老李走上跳板，马上吩咐：‘注意，侦察员来了。’于是，革新的工具立即收拾得一干二净。”张信才小组改进甲板打浆方法，缩短了两个工作日。柳廷栋小组的老陈就“偷偷地把甲板撬起来看。”
    后来，经过党组织的教育（自然还有一个细致的过程，这里把它省略了），“关系有了好转，再不互相猜忌了。”还订了“红旗竞赛协议书”。这样一来：先进的操作方法公开了，革新的工具通用了，生产热情得到新的鼓舞，生产进度直线上升起来。于是“冤家”也变成了战友。
    有两件关于友好协作的事：一天下午，柳廷栋小组正在舱面打浆，突然要来大雨，如果当天打不完，晚上雨水一淋，起码要推迟两天，而且质量无法保证。张信才马上派李志发，领三个同志，带上工具，去支援柳廷栋小组打浆。这时柳廷栋小组的同志们正心急如火，一看来了援兵，真是喜出望外。
    另一件事是：张信才小组作桅杆工作，下道工序催得很急，快下班了，可是还差一大截。柳廷栋也及时派老陈带着几个同志相帮，张信才一见陈庆华就感谢地说：“好，你们雪中送炭来了。”
    我想，怎样作才有利于国家，同时也有利于两个小组；怎样作便有害于国家，同时也有害于两个小组，人人都会从这个故事中得出结论来，不必再说。值得谈谈的倒是，这样简单明了的事，为什么两个小组以前却看不出来呢？别人来说服、劝解，一时也还解不开，是个什么原因？
    简单地说，不是别的，主要就是那个“锦标主义”的帷幕，遮住了他们的眼睛。只要看看他们面对面的一次自我检查就会明白：
    柳廷栋：“借着竞赛来抬高自己，打击别人，完全钻到资本主义的臭泥坑里去啦！个人英雄主义真是害人不浅！”
    张信才：“是呀，当时有人向我指出，这是个人英雄主义，我还不服气呢。我以为给小组争光荣，还不是为了集体吗？”
    那个去撬甲板的老陈说：“我过去偷撬甲板的举动，多么卑鄙自私，现在一想起来脸上就火辣辣的……。”
    这是既诚恳又深刻的自我批评。这种自我批评发扬了这几位同志的工人阶级的自觉精神，扯去了蒙在他们脸上的资产阶级的帷幕，露出工人阶级光辉面目的本色来。我想，积极地批评和自我批评，所以是工人阶级必不可少的武器的原因，也就在这里；而党的政治思想工作的内容之一，也就是不断去启发人们的这种自觉！
