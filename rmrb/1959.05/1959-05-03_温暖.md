Warmth
Gu Gong

    The car's headlights, like a golden star, flowed and swirled on the snowy mountain. When the light illuminated a small village covered in white snow, it suddenly dimmed – the car had broken down.
    The driver anxiously pushed open the car door, carrying his tool bag, and crawled under the car. At first, touching the parts, they were still a bit warm; but before long, they cooled down, gradually becoming as cold as ice.
    Along the roadside, several small wooden windows were opened, revealing sleepy faces.
    By this time, the driver had whistled as he crawled out from under the car. He used a rag to pat off the snowflakes from his shoulders and back. He raised his head and looked at each small window.
    The small windows closed again one by one...
    "People continue to sleep soundly, and I should continue on my way!" the driver thought, rubbing his eyelids that hadn't closed for two days and two nights. "Of course, it would be nice to sit in the driver's cabin and take a nap. The section of the road blocked by snow is already behind me, and it will be easier ahead. But, if I close my eyes, who will take care of the rice and canned goods in the back of the car!"
    After hesitating for half a minute, the driver grabbed a handful of snow and slapped it hard on his forehead, then started the engine again.
    The car was about to move, but the road in front of the car was already crowded with Tibetans – they had rushed out of their homes, carrying jars and holding plates.
    An elderly Tibetan man standing in the front hadn't even put his clothes on properly, and didn't have time to tighten his belt. He squinted in the glaring headlights.
    "What? Ma Mei, are you leaving already?"
    "I have to hurry on my way!" the driver replied.
    "You've been driving for most of the night, take a rest!" the old man said earnestly. In the light of the car, the corners of the old man's eyes seemed to be glistening with tears.
    "Yes! Come and sit in our village."
    Many voices, of different thicknesses and pitches, male and female, chimed in.
    "Warm yourself by the fire pit."
    "Have a sip of butter tea."
    Now, the driver really couldn't sit still. He jumped out of the car, walked up to the villagers, and said loudly: "Folks, Tocche, Tocche, I'm really sorry to bother you all. I'd be very happy to sit in each of your houses, but what about my car? There are so many things in the back of my car." The driver raised a hand and pointed to the high, bulging sacks piled up behind the car.
    The people in the village whispered quietly, not knowing how to keep this beloved person. The old man took two more steps forward.
      "You go and rest for a while! Leave the car and the things to me, I have a knife!" As the old man spoke, he drew his knife. In the headlights, the knife gleamed particularly brightly. "If a grain of rice or a kernel of grain is missing, come and find me!"
    The driver looked at the old man's trembling beard, and was so moved that he couldn't speak.
    "What, don't you trust me?" Seeing that the driver didn't answer, the old man's pride was hurt. His hand trembled as he reached into his inner clothing, feeling around, fumbling for a long time before taking out a neatly folded piece of paper.
    Ah! It turned out to be a certificate of merit. It was printed with red stars and red flags, the old man's name, the old man's hard work when leading a yak team for the People's Liberation Army...
    Who could resist such a sincere old man! The driver smiled sincerely, and surrounded by many Tibetan compatriots, walked into the village entrance and pushed open the door of a house.
    The driver was really exhausted, and he quickly fell asleep on the felt blanket by the fire pit. But in his dream, he could still hear the sound of the Tibetan old man patrolling by the car: shasha, shasha... Warmth! This car soldier, who always travels in wind and snow, his dream is also so warm!
    Note: “Ma Mei” means soldier.
        “Tocche” means thank you.

    温暖
    顾工
    汽车的灯光，像一颗金星，在雪山上流动着，旋绕着。灯光照亮了一个白雪复盖着的小小的山村时，突然黯淡下来——汽车抛锚了。
    司机焦急地推开车门，提着工具袋，钻到汽车底下。起初，用手摸着那些机件，还有点发烫；可是过不多久，就冷下来，渐渐冷得像冰块一样。
    沿着公路边的几扇小木窗，都拉开了，露出一张张睡眼惺忪的脸。
    这时，司机已经吹着口哨从车底下钻了出来。他用擦车的布，拍掉了肩上的和脊背上的雪片。他抬起头来，对每扇小窗望了望。
    小窗又一扇扇地关上了……
    “人们继续安睡了，我也应该继续赶路啦！”司机一边想着，一边使劲揉了揉两天两夜没有合过的眼皮。“当然，能坐在司机棚里，打上个盹也好。雪封山的地段已经过去了，前边就好办了。可是，自己一合眼，车后面装的那些大米、罐头，交给谁来照应呢！”
    犹豫了这么半分钟，司机抓把雪，狠着往额上一拍，便又踩响了发动机。
    车刚要走，可是车前面的路上，已经挤满了藏民——他们从家里赶了出来，提着罐子，托着盘子。
    站在前面的一个藏族老人，衣服还没穿齐整，腰带也没来得及束紧。他在耀眼的车灯前眯缝着眼睛。
    “怎么？马梅?，你就要走吗？”
    “要赶路啊！”司机回答。
    “走了大半夜了，你歇一歇吧！”老人恳切地说。在车灯的照射下，老人的眼角，似乎还闪着一点泪光。
    “是啊！到我们村里坐坐。”
    好多粗细不同、高低不同的男声、女声都和了上来。
    “在火塘边上暖暖身子。”
    “喝上一口油茶。”
    这下，弄得司机真坐不住了。他跳下车来，走到乡亲们的面前，大声说：“老乡们，托切、托切?，真是太打扰你们了。我很高兴到你们每个人的屋里去坐一坐，可是我的车呢？我的车后面，还有这么多东西。”司机扬起一只手，指着车后堆得高高的鼓鼓囊囊的麻袋。
    村里的人悄悄地议论着，不知该怎么来挽留这个心爱的人。那位老人又走上两步。
      “你去歇会儿吧！车和东西交给我，我有刀！”老人一边说着一边就把刀抽了出来。在车灯前，刀光特别晃眼。“要是少了一粒米，少了一颗粮，你就找我吧！”
    司机望着老人抖动着的胡须，感动得说不出话来。
    “怎么，你不相信我吗？”老人见司机不回答，自尊心受了伤害，他的手哆嗦着，伸进自己的内衣，摸着，掏着，费好大劲，才拿出一块折叠得很严整的纸。
    啊！原来是一张奖状。上面印着红星、红旗，老人的名字，老人在给解放军赶牦牛队时的辛勤事迹……。
    谁能拗得过这样真诚的老人呢！司机由衷地微笑着，在许多藏族同胞的拥簇中，走进了村口，推开了屋门。
    司机真是困得够呛，他在火塘边的毡毯上，很快就睡着了。但是在梦中，他还听见那位藏族老人在汽车边巡逻的脚步声：唦唦、唦唦……。温暖啊！这位总是在风雪中来往的汽车兵，他的梦也是这样温暖！
    注：?“马梅”即军人。
        ?“托切”即谢谢。
