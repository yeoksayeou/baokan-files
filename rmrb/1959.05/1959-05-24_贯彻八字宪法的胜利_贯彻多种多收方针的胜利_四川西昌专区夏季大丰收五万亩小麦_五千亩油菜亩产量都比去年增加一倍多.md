Title: Victory of Implementing the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, Victory of Implementing the Policy of Diverse Planting and Increased Harvests: Major Summer Harvest in Xichang Prefecture, Sichuan Province: 50,000 Mu of Wheat and 5,000 Mu of Rapeseed More Than Doubled in Yield Per Mu Compared to Last Year

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 23rd: The Xichang Prefecture in Sichuan Province, located between the Dadu River and the Jinsha River, has announced the first piece of good news regarding the summer harvest. More than 900,000 mu of summer-ripening crops such as wheat, rapeseed, peas, and broad beans have been completely harvested. A portion of the crops that have already been threshed, after weighing and verification, shows the following yields: More than 50,000 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 426 jin per mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year; 5,078 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of 138 jin per mu, an increase of more than double compared to last year; more than 130,000 mu of broad beans, with an average yield of 247 jin per mu, an increase of 65% compared to last year.

This fertile subtropical region used to have very little planting of some spring crops, and the yield of some crops was very low. However, this year there is a new situation. While achieving large-scale high yields throughout the region, some high-yield records have also been created. In the past, Huili County rarely grew rapeseed, and the average yield of rapeseed was only 50 to 60 jin per mu; this year, the Mosuo Commune in the county had 4.59 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of 579 jin per mu, the highest of which was 1,015.5 jin of rapeseed per mu. Nearby farmers are spreading this as a wonder. The Renge Commune in this county had 3.6 mu of wheat, with an average yield of 1,009 jin per mu. The Hongyan Commune in Huidong County harvested 1,474 jin of dry broad beans in a 1.3 mu high-yield experimental field, with an average yield of 1,133 jin per mu.

In order to verify the output, the Xichang Prefectural Party Committee sent five working groups to various places for inspection and acceptance after the summer harvest began. Many high-yield fields and large-area high-yield fields have been harvested, threshed, and weighed under the personal participation of the Party secretaries and ministers of the prefecture, county, and district Party committees, or the cadres and technicians sent out.

The unprecedented summer harvest in Xichang Prefecture this year is primarily due to the implementation of the policy of simultaneously advancing the cultivation of high-yield fields and diverse planting for increased harvests. The area of spring crops in the region increased by 12% this year, and at the same time, some high-yield ditches, dams, and areas were cultivated in a planned way as command fields, and cadres at all levels personally engaged in production with the peasants to provide specific leadership. The vast majority of the more than 48,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields planted throughout the region this year yielded higher than ordinary fields. Secondly, conservative thinking was broken in production technology, and the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" was earnestly implemented. The spring land was generally deeply ploughed to a depth of 8 inches to 1 foot, and 10,000 to 30,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied. Wheat and rapeseed were basically realized with improved varieties. The amount of seed used per mu of 420,000 mu of wheat was increased from about 15 jin to about 30 jin, achieving appropriate dense planting. The region also carried out meticulous field management, with wheat generally receiving three applications of fertilizer and three irrigations, broad beans receiving two applications of fertilizer and three irrigations, and rapeseed receiving seven applications of fertilizer and three irrigations, so that the three types of seedlings of spring crops decreased from the initial 25% to below 8%, ensuring long ears, many pods, many grains, and heavy seeds.

### 贯彻八字宪法的胜利　贯彻多种多收方针的胜利  四川西昌专区夏季大丰收五万亩小麦  五千亩油菜亩产量都比去年增加一倍多

    贯彻八字宪法的胜利　贯彻多种多收方针的胜利
    四川西昌专区夏季大丰收五万亩小麦
    五千亩油菜亩产量都比去年增加一倍多
    新华社成都23日电　位于大渡河和金沙江之间的四川省西昌专区，传出了夏季大丰收的第一个捷报。九十多万亩小麦、油菜籽、豌豆、蚕豆等夏熟作物已经全部收割完毕。其中已经脱粒的一部分作物，经过过秤核实，产量如下：小麦五万多亩，平均亩产四百二十六斤，比去年增产一倍半；油菜五千零七十八亩，平均亩产一百三十八斤，比去年增产一倍以上；蚕豆十三万多亩，平均亩产二百四十七斤，比去年增产65％。
    这片富饶的亚热带地区，过去有些小春作物很少种植，有些作物产量很低。但是今年却出现一番新的景象。全区在获得大面积丰产的同时，还创造出一些高产纪录。会理县过去很少种油菜，以往种的油菜平均每亩只产菜籽五、六十斤；今年这个县摩挲公社有四亩五分九厘油菜，平均亩产菜籽五百七十九斤，其中最高的一亩，净收菜籽一千零一十五斤半。附近农民把这件事当成奇闻传颂。这个县仁格公社三亩六分小麦，平均亩产一千零九斤。会东县红岩公社在一亩三分蚕豆高产试验田里，净收干蚕豆一千四百七十四斤，平均亩产一千一百三十三斤。
    为了核实产量，中共西昌地委在夏收开始以后，曾派出五个工作组到各地检查验收。许多高产田和大面积丰产田，都经过地、县、区、社党委书记、部长或派出的干部和技术人员亲自参加收割、脱粒和过秤。
    西昌专区今年获得夏季空前丰收，首先是由于贯彻了培植高额丰产田和多种多收同时并进的方针。全区今年小春作物面积扩大12％，同时有计划地培植了一些丰产沟、坝、片作为指挥田，各级干部亲自和农民一起生产，进行具体领导。今年全区种植的四万八千多亩小麦丰产田，绝大部分产量都比一般田高。其次，在生产技术上打破了保守思想，认真贯彻了农业八字宪法。小春地一般深耕八寸到一尺，施底肥一至三万斤，小麦、油菜基本上实现了良种化，四十二万亩小麦每亩用种都从原来十五斤左右增加到三十斤左右，做到适当密植。全区还细致地进行田间管理，小麦一般做到三肥三水，蚕豆二肥三水，油菜七肥三水，使小春作物三类苗由最初占25％下降到8％以下，保证了穗长、荚多、粒多、籽重。
