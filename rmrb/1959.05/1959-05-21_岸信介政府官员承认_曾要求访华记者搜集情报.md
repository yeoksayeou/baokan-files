Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th -- Kishi Nobusuke government's Cabinet Research Office Deputy Director Goro Hattori admitted today that the department under his leadership had submitted a list of thirteen questions regarding the collection of Chinese military and economic intelligence to Tadao Mukai, a Kyodo News reporter who visited China with the Socialist Party delegation in March this year, and had attempted to force Mukai to act as a spy.

Hattori made this admission of the Kishi Nobusuke government's despicable actions when Honda Ryosuke, a representative of the Japan Congress of Journalists, and others protested to the Cabinet Research Office about the above incident.

The Japan Congress of Journalists today publicly released the list of items regarding the collection of Chinese military intelligence that the Cabinet Research Office gave to Tadao Mukai. From this list, it can be seen that the Cabinet Research Office had requested Tadao Mukai to collect information on whether China possesses missiles, as well as information on the Beijing airport, China's atomic energy center, and steel center, and other related military and economic intelligence.

    岸信介政府官员承认
    曾要求访华记者搜集情报
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府的内阁调查室次长服部五郎今天承认，在他领导下的部门曾经向今年3月随社会党代表团到中国访问的共同社记者向井忠雄提交了一份关于搜集中国的军事、经济情报的包括十三个问题的项目单，并且曾经企图迫使向井充当间谍。
    服部是在日本记者会议的代表本田良介等向内阁调查室就上述事件提出抗议时，承认岸信介政府的这个部门所干出的卑鄙勾当的。
    日本记者会议今天公开发表了内阁调查室交给向井忠雄的关于搜集中国军事情报的项目单。从这份项目单中可以看出，内阁调查室曾经要求向井忠雄搜集中国是否拥有导弹，以及北京机场、中国的原子能中心和钢铁中心的情况等有关军事和经济的情报。
