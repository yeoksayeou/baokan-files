How We Ensure All Cement is Up to Standard
Liu Qingshu, Harbin Cement Plant

Beginning in the first quarter of this year, the quality of cement produced by the Harbin Cement Plant has significantly improved. All outgoing cement meets the national quality inspection standards, and the practice of lowering standards has been eliminated. This marks a complete turnaround from the quality decline and reduced grade issues of the past year, essentially achieving the comprehensive leap forward guideline of "guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing quantity, and guaranteeing safety" as proposed by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee.

Last year, our plant saw a significant leap forward in cement production. Without adding equipment, cement production increased by 36% compared to 1957, a remarkable growth rate for the cement industry. However, alongside this great leap forward, some shortcomings and problems arose in our work, the most significant of which was a decline in cement quality. From August of last year, when we adopted limestone batching, until the end of the year, 120,000 tons of cement failed to meet the standards, accounting for 34% of the total annual output. Among these, 72,000 tons of 500-grade cement were downgraded to 400-grade, 17,000 tons to 300-grade; 22,000 tons of 400-grade cement were downgraded to 300-grade, and 8,000 tons to 200-grade.

The main reason for this situation was that our understanding and implementation of the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" were not deep or thorough enough. Some comrades viewed increasing production and guaranteeing quality as irreconcilable contradictions. They believed that increasing production required relaxing fineness standards, and thus, the fineness of raw materials was relaxed from below 6% to 15% without principle; the particle size of cement grinding was relaxed from 8% to 12%, resulting in a large amount of substandard cement. In addition, during last year's Great Leap Forward, due to the advocacy of daring to think and act, and breaking old rules and regulations, the masses did create many miracles. However, due to a one-sided understanding on the part of some comrades, some regulations and systems beneficial to production were abolished without analysis, and no new, more appropriate systems were established in their place, resulting in management chaos for a time. Objectively speaking, the adoption of limestone batching also created certain difficulties for technical and production management. After adopting limestone batching, there were more types of raw materials, and the storage space was small, leading to chaotic stacking, making it difficult to control the batching process. Moreover, limestone batching was a new experience, and its laws were not well understood. As a result, the composition of raw materials fluctuated greatly. The qualification rate of raw materials decreased from over 85% before limestone batching to 55% in May of last year, and even dropped to around 18% in late October (the national standard is 80%).

In this situation, how did we reverse the serious situation of unqualified quality and ensure that 100% of the cement produced starting in January 1959 met the national quality inspection standards? Our specific practices, taken together, mainly involve the following four points:

(1) Resolutely implement the general line of achieving a comprehensive leap forward of "more, faster, better, and more economical." In order to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we convened cadre meetings and employee congresses to summarize the work of 1958 and discuss the tasks of 1959 at all levels. We used the quality decline in 1958 as a negative lesson to repeatedly educate the masses. After this period of debate, the vast majority of comrades recognized that increasing production and guaranteeing quality are unified. The production practice of the past six months has confirmed that limestone batching is indeed a good experience for increasing production, and that the poor quality in the past was caused by poor technical operation and management. Therefore, it was determined that limestone batching would still be one of the ways to increase cement production in the future.

(2) Revise rules and regulations and adopt specific measures to control quality. Last year, we broke more of the old rules and regulations than we established new ones, and some that should not have been broken were broken. For example, the system of regularly issuing quality indicators and regularly conducting statistical analysis was also abolished, making quality control unorganized for a time. In light of this situation, we conducted another comprehensive review of the original rules and regulations, and revised and supplemented them in accordance with actual needs. In terms of quality management, we adopted the measures of "three diligences" and "five controls."

Three diligences: namely, diligent testing, diligent communication, and diligent adjustment. Diligent testing allows operators to be aware of the fluctuations in the composition of raw materials after limestone batching, strengthen communication, and improve operations in order to make adjustments.

Five controls: (1) Strictly control the limestone and lime entering the factory, store them separately according to quality and type, and use them accordingly. (2) Control the particle size of limestone and lime entering the mill, and feed materials evenly to facilitate control. (3) Control the proportion of lime added to overcome the chaotic situation of adding more when there is more, adding less when there is less, and not adding when there is none in the past. (4) Control the free lime in clinker, and implement the method of "three bigs and one fast" (i.e., large wind, large coal, large material, and fast operation) to greatly reduce the free lime and improve the quality of clinker. (5) Control the fineness of cement. The fineness of 500-grade cement should be below 8%, and the fineness of 400-grade cement should be below 9%.

As a result of the above measures, the qualification rate of raw material quality has increased month by month. The qualification rate last year was around 20% to 30%, which increased to 60% in January, 72% in February, and 80% in March. The improvement in the quality of raw materials and the stability of its composition have created favorable conditions for improving the quality of clinker, making the proportion of clinker quality reaching the 500-grade cement standard rise from 10% last year to 90%, which is an important key to ensuring cement quality.

(3) Resolutely implement the Party's mass line, rely on the broad masses, and strengthen quality management. In the past, the quality management of finished and semi-finished products was only the responsibility of a few technical personnel related to quality. The laboratory gave the test results to the workshop technicians, who then notified the workers to adjust the batching according to the results. As a result, the workers were outside of the quality management process, unaware of the situation, and unable to fully utilize the wisdom and strength of the broad masses. In light of this situation, we proposed to disclose quality secrets and have everyone manage quality. In addition to announcing quality indicators to the masses on a monthly and ten-day basis, we also announced the results of each test to the masses. In this way, a situation has formed in our plant where everyone cares about quality and everyone tries to find ways to improve quality. Workers have included improving quality and increasing production in the group and individual leap forward plans, and have made it one of the main contents of the competition.

(4) Adhere to the "three-in-one" technical research association. The "three-in-one" technical research association fully utilizes the enthusiasm of workers and technicians, combines technicians and workers, and combines practical operation and technical research to solve operational technical problems more quickly and break through key problems in production. According to the needs of the actual situation, we have established regular and irregular technical research associations throughout the plant. A technical research association is established once a day in the calcination workshop, and technical research associations are established on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and weekends in the raw material and finished product workshops. Leaders of the plant and workshops, relevant technical personnel from the technical departments, workshop technicians, and workers participate together to study the problems existing in production and quality and solve them in a timely manner. Since the implementation of this system, it has been well received by the masses, who believe that the situation is fully grasped, problems are solved effectively and in a timely manner, the relationship between departments and workshops is closer, the relationship between technicians and workers is closer, and some key problems in production have been quickly resolved after being studied and improved by the technical research association.

The above are some of our experiences in specific work. From the current situation, although we have made certain achievements in quality management, there are still some problems, such as the free lime being sometimes still high. These problems still need us to constantly learn from experience and continue to improve in the future, so as to achieve a double leap forward in output and quality.

    我们怎样使水泥全部合格的
    哈尔滨水泥厂　刘庆述
    哈尔滨水泥厂从今年第一季度开始，水泥质量有了显著的好转，出库水泥百分之百达到国家质量检验标准，降低标准的现象已经杜绝。彻底扭转了去年质量下降、标号降低的现象，基本上实现了黑龙江省委所提出的保质、保量、保安全的全面跃进的方针。
    去年，我厂水泥生产有了很大的跃进。在不增加设备的基础上，比1957年水泥产量增长了36％，这是水泥工业少有的增长幅度。但是在大跃进的同时，我们的工作也产生了一些缺点和问题，其中最主要的问题是水泥质量下降。从去年8月份采用石灰配料以来，到年底，不合格水泥就有十二万吨，占全年总产量的34％。其中，五百号降为四百号的有七万二千吨，降为三百号的有一万七千吨；四百号降为三百号的有二万二千吨，降为二百号的有八千吨。
    造成这种情况的主要原因，是由于我们对总路线所提出的多、快、好、省的全面方针的体会和贯彻得不深不透，部分同志把提高产量和保证质量理解成不可调和的矛盾。他们认为，要提高产量就必须放宽细度，因而无原则的将生料细度由6％以下放宽到15％；水泥磨的粒度由8％放宽到12％；造成大量不合格水泥。此外，在去年大跃进中，由于提倡敢想敢干，打破陈规旧律，群众确实创造了不少奇迹，但是由于部分同志认识上的片面，不加分析地将有益于生产的一些规章制度也予以废除了，又没有相应地建立新的更合适的制度，因而一度造成管理上的混乱。从客观上讲，由于采用石灰配料，给技术管理和生产管理也造成一定的困难。采用石灰配料后，原材料品种较多，存放地点很小，堆放混乱，配料时不易掌握。加之石灰配料是个新经验，没有掌握其规律，因而生料成分波动很大，生料合格率由石灰配料前的85％以上，去年5月下降到55％，10月下旬甚至降低到18％左右（国家标准为80％）。
    在这种情况下，如何扭转质量不合格的严重局面，而使1959年1月份开始生产的水泥百分之百的合乎国家质量检验标准呢？我们的具体做法，综合起来，主要有以下四条：
    （一）坚决贯彻多快好省全面跃进方针。为了深入贯彻党的八届六中全会的精神，我们召开了干部会和职工大会，层层总结了1958年的工作和讨论了1959年的任务，并以1958年质量降低问题作为反面教训，向群众进行反复教育。经过这一段的辩论，绝大多数同志都认识到提高产量和保证质量是统一的。从半年来的生产实践中，证实了石灰配料确是提高产量的好经验，过去质量不好是技术操作和管理不善而造成的，因而确定了石灰配料仍是今后水泥增产的途径之一。（二）修订规章制度，采取了控制质量的具体措施。去年，我们对待过去的规章制度，是破得多，立得少，有些不该破的也破了。如定期下达质量指标和定期统计分析制度，也废除了，使质量控制一度无章可循。根据这一情况，我们对原有的规章制度又进行了一次全面的审查，结合实际需要，进行了重新修订和补充。在质量管理方面，采取了“三勤”“五控制”的措施。
    三勤：即勤化验，勤联系，勤调整。勤化验可以使操作工人在石灰配料后生料成分波动大的情况下，做到心中有数，加强联系，改进操作，以便调整。
    五控制：（1）对石灰石和石灰入厂进行严格控制，按质量按品种分堆存放，分别使用。（2）控制石灰与石灰石的入磨粒度，下料均匀，便于掌握。（3）控制石灰掺入比例，克服过去多来多掺，少来少掺，不来不掺的混乱情况。（4）控制熟料中的游离石灰，实行“三大一快”的方法（即：大风、大煤、大料，快速运转），使游离石灰大大下降，提高熟料的质量。（5）控制水泥细度。五百号水泥细度在8％以下，四百号水泥在9％以下。
    由于采取了以上措施，生料质量合格率月月上升。合格率去年为20％到30％左右，1月份提高到60％，2月份提高到72％，3月份提高到80％。由于生料质量提高，成分稳定，对提高熟料质量创造了良好的条件，使熟料质量达到五百号水泥的比重，由去年的10％上升到90％，这是保证水泥质量的重要关键。
    （三）坚决贯彻党的群众路线，依靠广大群众，加强质量管理。过去成品和半成品的质量管理，只有少数与质量有关的技术人员负责。化验室将试验结果交给车间技术员，技术员再根据结果通知工人进行调整配料。这样做的结果，使工人处于质量管理之外，心中无数，不能充分发挥广大群众的智慧和力量。根据这一情况，我们提出了公开质量秘密，人人管理质量，除了按月按旬地向群众公布质量指标外，并将每次试验结果向群众公布。这样，在我厂就形成了人人关心质量，人人想办法提高质量的局面。工人们把提高质量和提高产量同时订入小组和个人跃进计划内，并作为竞赛的主要内容之一。
    （四）坚持了三结合的技术研究会。三结合的技术研究会充分发挥了工人和技术人员的积极作用，使技术人员和工人相结合，实际操作和技术研究结合起来，更快地解决操作技术问题，突破生产中的关键问题。我们根据实际情况的需要，在全厂建立了定期和不定期的技术研究会，在烧成车间建立了每天一次的技术研究会，在原料和制成车间建立了一、三、五和周末技术研究会，由厂部和车间领导，技术部门有关技术人员和车间技术员及工人参加，共同研究生产和质量方面所存在的问题，并及时进行解决。这个制度执行以来，很受群众欢迎，认为情况掌握的全面，解决问题有力而及时，科室和车间的关系密切了，技术人员和工人的关系密切了，生产上的某些关键问题，经过技术研究会的研究改进，迅速的得到了解决。
    以上是我们在具体工作中的一些体会。从目前情况看来，在质量管理上虽然取得了一定成绩，但是仍然存在一些问题，如有时游离石灰仍然较高。这些问题还有待于我们今后不断的吸取教训，继续提高，使产量质量双跃进。
