Returned Overseas Chinese Intellectuals Devote Themselves to the Construction of the Great Motherland
Xie Nanguang, Chen Zongji, Wu Yixiu, Wu Huanxing (Joint Speech)
We come from all over the world. Some of us have different living habits from those in China, and some are even unfamiliar with the national language. However, we have a strong common language, which is patriotism, that is, a fervent love for our socialist motherland. With such patriotic enthusiasm, all difficulties can be overcome. We quickly learned the language of the motherland, quickly integrated into the new life habits of the motherland, and threw ourselves into the socialist construction of the motherland with great enthusiasm.
We fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
Since liberation, China's cultural and educational undertakings and science and technology have made great leaps and great achievements. China's contingent of intellectuals has grown very rapidly. This is inseparable from the Party's wise policy towards intellectuals.
We returned overseas Chinese intellectuals are contributing our abilities to the industrial and agricultural production front and the science, technology, culture, and education front of the motherland.
We come from all over the world. Many of us have lived in countries within the capitalist system for a long time. Some of us have different living habits from those in China, and some are even unfamiliar with the national language. However, we have a strong common language, which is patriotism, that is, a fervent love for our socialist motherland. With such patriotic enthusiasm, all difficulties can be overcome. We quickly learned the language of the motherland, quickly integrated into the new life habits of the motherland, became one with the people of the motherland, and threw ourselves into the socialist construction of the motherland with great enthusiasm, making certain contributions on all fronts. It is necessary to point out here that this is inseparable from the care and concern of the Party and the government for us. After we returned to the motherland, the Party and the government took care of us in all aspects, including work arrangements, political study, and living arrangements, and kindly helped us to make progress. It is no accident that returned overseas Chinese intellectuals can leap forward with comrades in the motherland in a very short period.
In our work and life practice, we deeply feel that only in the socialist motherland can our knowledge and ability truly benefit society, and can we continuously improve our scientific and technological level. Why?
First of all, because of the leadership of the Party, the Party's leadership is the most important guarantee for the rapid development of science and technology and continuous improvement. In order to realize the general line of socialist construction, the Party has formulated a socialist construction plan and a science and technology plan, which has made us clear about the direction of our efforts and has given our expertise the opportunity to be fully utilized in socialist construction. The Party has helped us master the Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods and master the laws of development of nature and human society. Mastering these viewpoints, methods, and laws can rapidly improve the level of science and technology; can master our own destiny, make fewer mistakes, and continuously advance with the development of society; only in this way can our skills serve socialism, that is to say, serve the people of the whole country. Last year, the great leap forward in science and technology that appeared with the great leap forward in socialist construction was inseparable from the struggle led by the Party in the political and ideological fronts that achieved a decisive victory; it was inseparable from the Party's policy of "the whole people engage in science, the whole people engage in technological revolution" and "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." The yield per mu of some experimental fields of rice reached more than 100,000 catties, and the yield per mu of cotton reached more than 1,000 catties. This is what bourgeois agricultural scientists could not have dreamed of in the past. This is the product of the mass movement of scientific and technological revolution led by the Party. It is a iron proof that scientific and technological research cannot be separated from the combination of workers and peasants and the mass line, and cannot rely solely on a few experts sitting in the laboratory. With the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, with the combination of experts and the working masses, learning from each other, correcting mistakes, exchanging experiences, and summarizing achievements, the truth can be increasingly complete. The Party not only continuously leads us forward in political thought and policies, but also continuously leads us in business, supporting and encouraging us to move forward continuously. Last year, our scientific and technological workers have already captured many fortresses of cutting-edge science, and many scientific and technological aspects have reached the international level, and some have even surpassed the international level. This is proof that science and technology are constantly and rapidly improving under the leadership of the Party.
We returned overseas Chinese intellectuals also made certain achievements and leaps forward in our work last year. For example, Tan Kun (returned overseas Chinese from the United States), an engineer and director of the Eighth Research Office of the North China Radio Equipment Factory Research Institute, was rated as an advanced producer of the entire factory in 1957. During the Great Leap Forward, he successfully trial-produced and installed a radio "printed circuit." Another example is Lin Shaodong, a doctor at the Hengyang Municipal Second Hospital and a returned overseas Chinese, who volunteered to cut skin and perform allogeneic skin grafts on steel warrior Yang Hanlin, who suffered burns covering 80% of his body. Finally, with the efforts of Lin Shaodong and the hospital staff, Yang Hanlin was rescued from the brink of death. The Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice commending Lin Shaodong and the hospital staff. Zheng Zhengyong, a Japanese returnee engineer at the Nanjing Chemical Plant, put forward 50 valuable rationalization proposals in the 1958 technical revolution movement and was twice named an advanced worker of the plant. Li Yuanru, an Indonesian returnee, is an engineer at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant. He has won the title of advanced worker of the workshop and the entire plant four times, was named a municipal advanced worker in 1956, a municipal labor model in 1957, and was elected as a representative to the Second People's Congress of Heilongjiang Province in 1958. There are many other returned overseas Chinese intellectuals who have achieved success in their work. The achievement of these returned overseas Chinese intellectuals is the result of resolutely listening to the Party and following the Party.
The socialist motherland provides good conditions for the development of science and technology. Even the imperialists cannot but admit this. The March 14th issue of the American "Business Week" said: "The equipment seen in many Chinese laboratories is exactly the same, but it is also uniformly good. Maybe not as good as the best equipment in the United States, but much better than the many equipment we can see in many laboratories. The libraries in all universities and research institutes are quite good. Chinese scientists can get any reference material they need at any time." Professor Airey, a world-renowned New Zealand soil mechanics expert, came to China after inspecting soil science research and equipment in advanced European countries and made this assessment of China's scientific and technological work: "China's scientific and technological research and equipment are very ideal. The government attaches great importance to the work of scientists and technicians and gives them full support and encouragement. Now scientific research units and universities across the country are carrying out exciting, advanced, and great work, training a large number of scientists and engineers. In Beijing alone, there are more than 15,000 engineers being trained." (May 1958, New Zealand Civil Engineering Journal) Yes, they have not yet seen that we may have even better equipment than them. We have the selfless help of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Our libraries are constantly being enriched. Even the books and materials of capitalist countries, as long as we need them, the country can buy them for us. In capitalist countries, intellectuals serve the profits of the bourgeoisie. Not only do they have to sell their labor cheaply, but they are also constantly threatened by unemployment. The inventions and creations of intellectuals are monopolized by capitalists, and those that are not beneficial to them are buried. This is not the case in our socialist country. The Party does not spare any cost to help us experiment with any invention, creation, or rationalization proposal. As long as it is effective, it will be adopted immediately, reported nationwide, popularized, and promoted. People across the country also put forward their supplementary, improved, and revised opinions on these inventions, creations, and suggestions at any time to make them more rational and perfect. Therefore, the science and technology of our motherland and all socialist countries can develop and leap forward at a rapid pace. At the same time, we are happy to work in the motherland, and we no longer have to live by looking at the faces of capitalists. This is an encouraging thing that friends living abroad cannot experience.
Finally, let's talk about ideological remoulding. When we were abroad, we did not have a very correct understanding of this issue; only after returning to China did we gradually gain a deep understanding and recognition of it in our work.
The enemy says that our ideological remoulding is "forced brainwashing," which is complete nonsense. We can clearly tell them: we do not use forced methods to carry out ideological remoulding. The self-remoulding of intellectuals is mainly through these three aspects: one is through observation and practice of social life; one is through business practice; and one is paying attention to regular political theory study. Under the care of Party and government organizations, we have the opportunity to participate in social activities, visit and visit everywhere, understand people's lives and production activities, and learn from them. We also often pay attention to the study of political theory, thereby continuously improving our ideological level, thereby also improving scientific and technological level. Society is constantly developing and progressing. We are now in the stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and will transition to communism when conditions are ripe. With the development and progress of society, people's ideology, consciousness, and lifestyle must also constantly change. If we do not carry out self-remoulding and wash away ideological consciousness and lifestyles that do not conform to social development, we will definitely be left behind. Everyone must constantly carry out ideological remoulding in order to continuously progress. Of course, we returned overseas Chinese intellectuals are no exception.
The rapid development of various constructions in the motherland requires tens of thousands of technological armies that are both red and expert. There are too few scientific and technological talents left over from old China. In the ten years since the founding of New China, the country has cultivated a new force, but it still cannot meet the actual needs. Tens of thousands of overseas Chinese scientists and Chinese students who work and study in the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Japan are a valuable asset of the motherland. They love the motherland and yearn for the motherland to be strong and prosperous. We eagerly hope that they will resolutely return to the motherland as soon as possible, give full play to their talents and wisdom, and participate in this unprecedented socialist construction cause.

　　归国华侨知识分子投入伟大祖国建设
    谢南光　陈宗基　吴益修　吴桓兴代表的联合发言
    我们来自世界各地，有的人生活习惯和国内不同，甚至不谙祖国语言，但是我们有一个强有力的共同语言，就是爱国，就是热爱社会主义祖国，有了这样的爱国热情，什么困难都能克服。我们很快地学会了祖国的语言，很快地同祖国的新生活习惯溶合起来，轰轰烈烈地投入祖国的社会主义建设
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告和彭真副委员长关于人大常务委员会工作的报告。
    解放以来，我国的文化教育事业和科学技术有了飞跃的发展和伟大的成就。我国的知识分子的队伍很迅速地长大了。这是同党的英明的对知识分子的政策分不开的。
    我们归国华侨知识分子，在祖国工农业生产战线和科技文教战线上贡献着自己的能力。
    我们来自世界各地，很多人长期侨居于资本主义体系国家，有的人生活习惯和国内不同，甚至不谙祖国语言，但是我们有一个强有力的共同语言，就是爱国，就是热烈地爱着社会主义的祖国，有了这样的爱国热情，什么困难都能够克服。我们很快地学会了祖国的语言，很快地同祖国的新生活习惯溶合起来，同祖国人民打成一片，热轰轰地投入祖国的社会主义建设事业，在各个战线上都做出了一定的贡献。这里需要特别指出，这是同党和政府对我们的关怀和照顾分不开的。我们回到祖国之后，党和政府对我们在工作安排、政治学习、生活照顾各方面都很周到，亲切地帮助我们进步。归国的华侨知识分子能够在很短的期间内跟祖国的同志们一起跃进，这并不是偶然的事情。
    在工作和生活实践中，我们深深地感觉到只有在社会主义的祖国，才能真正使我们的知识和能力为社会造福，也才能不断地提高科学技术水平。为什么呢？
    首先是因为有党的领导，党的领导是科学技术迅速发展，不断提高的最重要的保证。党为实现社会主义建设总路线，制订了社会主义建设规划和科学技术规划，使我们明确了努力的方向，使我们的专长在社会主义建设中得到充分的发挥的机会。党帮助我们掌握了马列主义的观点、方法，掌握自然界和人类社会发展规律。掌握了这观点、方法、规律，就能迅速提高科学技术水平；就能掌握自己的命运，少犯错误，不断地跟社会的发展而前进；只有这样，才能使自己技能为社会主义服务，也就是说才能为全国人民服务。去年，随着社会主义建设大跃进而出现的科学技术方面的大跃进，是同党领导我们在政治、思想战线上进行一次获得决定性胜利的斗争分不开的；是同党的“全民搞科学，全民搞技术革命”和“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针分不开的。水稻的一些试验田的亩产达十多万斤，棉花亩产千余斤，这是过去资产阶级农业科学家所梦想不到的。这是党所领导的科学技术革命群众运动的产物。科学技术的研究不与工农相结合，不走群众路线，只靠少数专家坐在实验室里是不成的，这就是一个铁证。有了马列主义思想的指导，有了专家同劳动群众的结合，互相学习，修正错误，交流经验，总结成绩，真理才能得到日臻完整。党不但在政治思想和政策方面不断地领导着我们前进，而且在业务方面也不断地领导我们，支持鼓励着我们不断地前进。去年我们的科技工作者已经攻下了不少尖端科学的堡垒，不少的科学技术方面已经达到国际水平，有的甚至超过国际水平，这就是科学技术由于党的领导而不断地迅速地提高水平的证明。
    我们归国的华侨知识分子去年在工作上也取得了一定的成就和跃进。如华北无线电器材厂研究所工程师兼第八研究室主任谭坤（美国归侨）一九五七年曾被评为全厂的先进生产者，他在大跃进中试制成功安装收音机“印刷电路”。又如，衡阳市市立第二医院医生、归国华侨林绍东，为了抢救烫伤面积占全身百分之八十的钢铁战士杨翰林，自愿割肤，为伤员做异体植皮，终于在林绍东和全院的医务人员努力下，把杨翰林从死亡的边缘中抢救出来。中共衡阳市委曾发出通报，表扬林绍东和全院的医务人员。在南京化工厂任工程师的日本归侨郑正镛，在一九五八年技术革命运动中，提出有实用价值的合理化建议达五十条，两次被评为厂的先进工作者。印尼归侨李渊如，是哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂工程师，曾先后四次获得车间和全厂的先进工作者的称号，一九五六年被评为市级先进工作者，一九五七年被评为市级劳动模范，一九五八年被选为黑龙江省第二届人民代表大会代表。其他在工作上有成就的归国华侨知识分子还有不少。归国华侨知识分子这些成就的取得，就是因为坚决听党的话跟党走的结果。
    社会主义的祖国为科学技术的发展提供良好的条件。就连帝国主义者也不能不承认这一点。三月十四日的美国“商业周刊”说：“在许多中国实验室内所看到的设备都是一模一样的，但也是一律都很好的。也许比不上美国最好的设备，但是比我们在许多实验室内所能看到的许多设备还要好得多。在所有的大学和研究所的图书馆是相当好的。中国科学家在任何时候都可以得到他所需要的任何参考资料。”世界著名的新西兰土力学专家爱里教授，在视察欧洲先进国家的土力科学研究和设备后来到我国，对我国的科技工作做了这样的估价：“中国的科技研究和设备是很理想的，政府非常重视科学者和技术家的工作，给以充分的支持和鼓励，现在全国的科学研究单位和大学正在进行着令人兴奋的先进的伟大的工作，培养出来大量的科学者和工程师，仅仅在北京一个城市，正在训练的工程师就有一万五千多人。”（一九五八年五月新西兰土木学报）是的，他们是还没有看到我们还可能比他们更好的设备的。我们有苏联和其他社会主义国家无私的帮助。我国的图书馆正在不断地充实。就是资本主义国家的图书资料，只要我们需要，国家就可以替我们买得来，而在资本主义国家里面，知识分子是为资产阶级的利润服务的，不但要便宜出售劳动力，而且经常受着失业的威胁。知识分子的发明创造被资本家所垄断，对他们没有利益的就被埋没掉了。在我们社会主义国家就不是这样的，任何发明、创造、合理化建议，党都不惜任何代价帮助我们试验，只要用之有效，立刻就被采用，通报全国推广普及，全国人民并且还随时对这些发明、创造、建议，提出他们的补充改进修改的意见，使它更为合理完善，所以我们祖国和一切社会主义国家的科学技术能够一日千里的速度发展跃进。同时，我们在祖国工作是愉快的，再不用看资本家的脸色过生活了。这是侨居于国外的朋友们所不能体验到的、令人鼓舞的事情。
    最后谈谈思想改造问题。我们在国外的时候，对这个问题也没有十分正确的认识；回国后才在工作中逐渐得到了深刻的体会和认识。
    敌人说我们的思想改造是“强迫洗脑”，这完全是胡说。我们可以明白地告诉他们：我们实行思想改造并不用强迫的方法。知识分子的自我改造主要是通过这三个方面：一是通过社会生活的观察和实践；一是通过业务的实践；一是注意经常的政治理论学习。在党政组织的关怀下，我们有机会参加社会活动，到处参观、访问，了解人民生活和生产活动，向他们学习。我们还经常注意政治理论的学习，从而不断地提高自己的思想水平，从而也提高科学、技术水平。社会是不断地发展前进的。我们现在是处在社会主义革命和社会主义建设阶段，将来条件成熟了就向共产主义过渡。随着社会的发展和进步，人们的思想意识、生活作风也要不断地发生变化。如果不进行自我改造、洗刷掉不符合社会发展的思想意识、生活作风，那是肯定要落伍的。人人都要不断地进行思想改造，以求不断地进步，当然，我们归国华侨知识分子也不能例外。
    祖国各项建设的飞跃发展，需要数以万计的、又红又专的科技大军。旧中国遗留下来的科学技术人才是太少了。新中国建国十年来，国家已经培养了一批新的力量，但仍然不能满足实际的需要。数以万计的留在美国、英国、荷兰、法国、日本工作和学习的华侨科学家和中国留学生，是祖国一部分宝贵财产。他们是热爱祖国的，渴望祖国强大繁荣。我们热切地希望他们毅然地尽早回到祖国来，发挥他们的才能和智慧，参加这个史无前例的社会主义建设事业。
