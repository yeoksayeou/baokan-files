Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 17th.  For several months, the entire people of the Russian Federation of the Soviet Union held no less than 200,000 meetings to widely discuss the "Outline on Strengthening the Connection Between School and Life and Further Developing the Soviet National Education System" jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers last December.  The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, at its recent meeting, passed a resolution to fully launch the reform of school education starting from the new school year this year.

In accordance with the spirit of the resolution, starting from the new school year this year, all first-year students in universities and students in grades 9 to 11 of secondary schools with production education will study according to the new teaching syllabus; seven-year secondary schools will be changed to eight-year schools (with the exception of individual seven-year schools); and vocational technical schools and secondary specialized schools will also begin comprehensive reforms.

In order to cultivate people with communist morality, all-round development, broad scientific knowledge, and a high level of culture and politics, the Russian Federation has formulated new teaching regulations.  An important measure stipulated in the regulations is that, without reducing theoretical classes, students in various types of schools will participate in production learning and production internships in factories, mines, collective farms, state farms, and construction sites, in addition to participating in production internships in school workshops. These courses will be taught by skilled workers, engineers, and agronomists from industrial and mining enterprises. In addition, universities will also cooperate with factories; on the one hand, the schools will set up departments in enterprises to help workers improve their theoretical knowledge, and on the other hand, the enterprises will recruit students as workers to help students master practical knowledge.

Other measures include: moving agricultural specialized schools from cities to rural areas, and factories and enterprises establishing factory-run higher technical schools managed by the enterprises.

In higher technical schools, in order to enable production labor to truly help students gradually master professional and technical operating procedures, most students in higher technical schools will first participate in practical work in industrial and mining enterprises in their first and second years, while attending night universities or correspondence universities, and then return to school for further study. Some students first need to study some more complex theoretical problems and do some complex experimental subjects. In addition to participating in the labor production classes stipulated by the school, they may not participate in certain practical work for the first two or three years, but they must have one year to do practical work in industrial and mining enterprises.

Currently, there are 55 agricultural specialized schools in the Russian Federation, 45 of which are located in cities. In order to enable students to master production knowledge more deeply and to closely link schools with production departments, in addition to increasing labor production classes in agricultural specialized schools, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation has decided to gradually move agricultural specialized schools to areas where large-scale state farms are located.

In order to meet the needs of national economic development, labor reserve schools should be vigorously established in the eastern and northern regions of the republic. First, vocational and technical education should be developed at a high speed in Novosibirsk, Irkutsk Oblast, Kemerovo Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Altai Krai, Bashkir and Tatar Autonomous Republics, and other places to train a large number of new skilled workers. Starting from 1959, approximately 100,000 young industrial, construction, and transportation workers and agricultural machinery personnel should be transferred from the workers trained by the labor reserve schools to the eastern region every year.

Factory higher technical schools directly managed by major industrial enterprises have begun to be established in the Russian Federation. The leaders of the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory and the scholars of the Moscow Automobile Mechanical Institute have formulated a specific organizational outline for the factory higher technical school.

There have been precedents for cooperation between schools and factories. For example, after the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine and the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Institute jointly formulated a cooperation plan, a large number of students are studying while participating in practical work. Engineers directly serve as teachers. Many students who will graduate this year have chosen their graduation thesis topics with the help of teachers and engineers based on their experience and training in practical work. According to the suggestions of scholars from many universities in Moscow, workers' night schools have been established in many large factories in Moscow, so that workers and staff can study theoretical knowledge, and students of higher technical schools can participate in the actual work of the factories under the guidance of excellent engineers in the major factories. The Moscow Petroleum and Gas Industry Institute, with the help of enterprises and social organizations in the Tatar and Bashkir Autonomous Republics, established a night school department in Almetyevsk, and established branches of certain departments in Bugulma and Leninogorsk. Currently, there are 500 students attending classes in the Almetyevsk night school department.

Universities in the Russian Federation will send 70,000 to 75,000 college students to various industrial and mining enterprises this year to participate in practical work, so that students can truly master certain skills and become excellent engineers in the future.

According to the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, the education reform work in the Russian Federation is expected to be completed within three to five years. After the education reform, not only will the quality of teaching be greatly improved, but also the number of schools and students will increase significantly with the needs of national economic development. By 1965, the Russian Federation will accept 4.58 million students, which is equal to nine times the current number of students. Currently, there are 3,900 ordinary secondary workers' night schools in the Russian Federation, which will be developed to 5,700 by 1965-1966. The number of workers' night schools and correspondence schools in rural areas will increase from the current 1,300 to 5,800 in 1965-1966. There will be 3,000 eight-year secondary schools by 1966, which is 12,300 more than the existing seven-year secondary schools. In April this year, the Supreme Soviets of all Soviet republics held meetings to discuss the implementation of the national education reform and passed laws on reforming national education.

### 加强学校同生活的联系  进一步发展国民教育制度  俄罗斯联邦今年将全面进行教育改革

    加强学校同生活的联系  进一步发展国民教育制度
    俄罗斯联邦今年将全面进行教育改革
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联俄罗斯联邦全体人民用了好几个月的时间，在不下二十万次的会议上，广泛讨论了苏联共产党中央委员会和部长会议去年12月联合发出的“关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度”的提纲。俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃在最近举行的会议上已通过决议，自今年新学年开始将全面展开学校教育的改革工作。
    根据决议的精神，从今年新学年开始，高等学校的全部一年级学生和带有生产教育的中等学校的九年级到十一年级的学生将全部按照新的教学大纲进行学习；七年制中学则改为八年制（个别七年制学校例外）；职业技术学校和中等专门学校也将开始进行全面改革。
    为了培养具有共产主义道德品质、全面发展的具有广泛科学知识和高度文化、政治水平的人，俄罗斯联邦制定了新的教学规章。规章中规定的重要措施是：各类学校在不减少理论课的基础上，学生们除了在学校的工场参加生产实习外，还要到工厂、矿山、集体农庄、国营农场和工地上进行生产学习与生产实习。这些课程将由工矿企业的熟练工人、工程师和农艺师来担任。此外，高等学校还将同工厂协作，一方面学校在企业开设科系，帮助工人提高理论知识，同时企业则吸收学生当工人，帮助学生掌握实践知识。
    其他的措施还包括：把农业专科学校由城市迁移到农村，工厂企业创办由企业管理的工厂高等技术学校。
    在高等技术学校中，为了使生产劳动真正能够帮助学生逐步掌握专业和技术操作规程，大部分高等技术学校的学生在一、二年级时先到工矿企业参加实际工作，同时上夜大学或函授大学，这以后再回校继续深造。也有些学生首先需要研究一些较复杂的理论问题，并且要作些复杂的实验学科，他们除参加学校规定的劳动生产课外，最初两三年可不参加一定的实际工作，但以后一定要有一年的时间，到工矿企业去做实际工作。
    现在俄罗斯联邦共有五十五个农业专科学校，其中四十五个设在城市，为了使学生较深入地掌握生产知识，使学校与生产部门密切联系，除了在农业专科学校增加劳动生产课外，俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃决定要逐步把农业专科学校迁移到设有规模较大的国营农场的地区。
    为了适应国民经济发展的需要，在共和国东部地区和北部地区要大力设立劳动后备学校，首先在新西伯利亚、伊尔库次克州、基米罗伏州、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区、阿尔泰边疆区、巴什基尔和鞑靼自治共和国等地高速度发展职业技术教育，大批地培养新的熟练工人。自1959年起要从劳动后备学校培养出的工人当中，每年向东部地区输送约十万名工业、建筑业和运输业的青年工人和农业机务人员。
    由各大工业企业直接管理的工厂高等技术学校在俄罗斯联邦已着手建立。莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂的领导人和莫斯科汽车机械学院的学者们已制定了一个具体的工厂高等技术学校组织大纲。
    学校同工厂协作的先例早已有了。如马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂和马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁学院共同制定了合作计划后，很大一部分学生正一面学习，一面参加实际工作，工程师直接担任教员，很多今年将要毕业的学生，在教员和工程师的帮助下，根据在实际工作中的体会和锻炼已选择了自己的毕业论文题目。根据莫斯科许多高等学校的学者们的建议，现在已在莫斯科的许多大工厂设立了工人夜校，这样工人和职员可以学习理论知识，高等技术学校的学生们可在各大工厂在优秀的工程师们的辅导下参加工厂的实际工作。莫斯科石油瓦斯工业学院在鞑靼和巴什基尔自治共和国各企业和社会团体的帮助下，在阿尔密皆夫斯克设立了夜校部，并在布古利马和列宁戈尔斯克设立了某些科系的分支，现在在阿尔密皆夫斯克夜校部已有五百个学生上课。
  俄罗斯联邦各高等学校今年将派七万到七万五千名大学生到各工矿企业参加实际工作，使学员们能够真正的掌握一定的技术，将来成为优秀的工程师。
    据俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃的决议，俄罗斯联邦教育改革工作预计在三至五年内完成，教育改革后，不仅会使教学质量大大提高，而且学校和学生的数量也将随着国民经济发展的需要而有显著增加。俄罗斯联邦到1965年将接受四百五十八万学员入学，这等于目前现有学员数目的九倍。目前俄罗斯联邦普通中等工人夜校有三千九百个，到1965—1966年将发展到五千七百个。农村中的工人夜校和函授学校将由现有的一千三百个增加到1965—1966年的五千八百个。八年制中学到1966年将有三千个，比现有的七年制中学多一万二千三百个。今年4月间，苏联各加盟共和国最高苏维埃都召开了会议，讨论贯彻国民教育改革的问题，并且通过了改革国民教育的法令。
