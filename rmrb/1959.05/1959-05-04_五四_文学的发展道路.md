    The Development Path of "May Fourth" Literature
    Shao Quanlin
    In order to correctly evaluate the revolutionary literature of the May Fourth period, I would like to first explain some of the circumstances of the literary movement at that time.
      The nature and historical characteristics of the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement have already been given extremely incisive scientific judgments in "On New Democracy." This was a communist cultural and ideological movement influenced by the Russian October Revolution and led by Chinese communists. This determined that the New Literature Movement could only follow the revolutionary road of development towards socialism, and could only be led by proletarian cultural thought. During the May Fourth period, the New Democratic cultural revolution was still in its initial stage. In this stage, the central political task was to thoroughly oppose imperialism and warlord rule; the central literary task was to "oppose the old feudal literature and classical Chinese, and advocate new literature and vernacular Chinese with anti-imperialist and anti-feudal content." The proletarian cultural thought—the communist worldview and social revolution theory—played its leading role through the united front of the literary circles. At that time, there were also struggles within the united front, that is, the struggle between the thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism upheld by the proletariat and the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, and the compromising reformism advocated by the bourgeoisie. This struggle prepared for the later split between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, forming the struggle between the two roads in literature over the past forty years. Revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers, under the leadership of proletarian thought, gradually embarked on the collectivist revolutionary road, while reactionary bourgeois writers went down the anti-people road. As Lu Xun said, the ranks of revolutionary literature "became purer and more elite as time went on." The development of literature after the "May Fourth" was along such a road—the development from revolutionary democracy to communist thought, and what determined it was the leadership of proletarian thought. After the founding of the Party in 1921, its task in the cultural field was to unite the broad masses of intellectuals and people to fight for the thorough democratic revolution. At that time, the propaganda of communist thought had penetrated deeply among intellectuals and young students, and had a great influence on literature, but when the Party was just established, there were very few proletarian writers, and they were still very immature. It was impossible to form their own team all at once, and it was impossible to immediately launch a large-scale proletarian literary movement like later. The Party could only directly and indirectly lead literature through revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers.
  (Before the establishment of the Party, some communist intellectuals united and influenced these writers to carry out literary movements.) Soviet revolutionary literary theories and works had not yet been widely introduced to China at that time, and there was no question of the construction of Marxist literary theory. The main task at that time was to embody the political demands of the proletariat and working people in literary creation. Socialist realism was still in its initial stage of gestation and budding, although this factor was the decisive factor guiding literature to gradually develop towards collectivist thought.
    The revolutionary writers of the early "May Fourth" period, such as Lu Xun and Guo Moruo, were mostly in the transitional period of moving towards the collectivist road. They saw the lessons of the failure of the Revolution of 1911, the disintegration and injury of imperialist countries, and the victory of the October Revolution, which made them resolutely fight against imperialism and feudalism on the one hand, and negated the possibility of China taking the capitalist road; on the other hand, their revolutionary ideals were still in a vague state, and it was impossible to become Marxists all at once. In their worldviews, there were contradictions between the new and the old. However, in any case, the new things, that is, the elements of materialism, were growing and developing, and were dominant. Politically, they affirmed the program of thorough democratic revolution put forward by the Party. This gave them a revolutionary democratic characteristic in thought that Chinese intellectuals before the "May Fourth" had never had. It was precisely because of this that they were able to embody the revolutionary demands of the masses of the people at that time in their works, that is, the political struggle demands of the proletariat and the Party, so that the Party could lead the literature at that time through them.
    The above is to explain the leadership of proletarian thought and the Party over literature during the May Fourth period, and also to explain the differences between the literary movement situation at that time and later. When evaluating "May Fourth" literature, we must first thoroughly refute the reactionary argument of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and revisionist elements that regards the "May Fourth" literary movement as led by the bourgeoisie (which has been discussed elsewhere in the previous paragraph of this article to be published in the May issue of "People's Literature"), but we cannot use the current requirements for socialist literature to measure it, and should evaluate it according to the historical situation at that time. In the past, it seems that there was such a simple view among some people: since the vast majority of works in the May Fourth period were works by petty-bourgeois writers, they were regarded as purely petty-bourgeois literature, ignoring the significance of their revolutionary literature under the leadership of proletarian thought, and thus intentionally or unintentionally belittling its historical value; at present, there are still some people who take a wipe-out attitude towards the new poetry since the "May Fourth." This view is incorrect. On the contrary, if only the works written by some communist intellectuals or party members at that time are used to explain the Party's leadership of "May Fourth" literature, it is also very insufficient. There is no doubt that Li Dazhao's papers on culture and literature, as well as Qu Qiubai's works and papers introducing Soviet literature, are of extremely important significance. They put forward clear revolutionary propositions in literary thought. But literature is mainly expressed through creation. Generally speaking, there were very few mature proletarian writers at that time, so the Party still had to lead literature through some outstanding revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers. This is how Lu Xun became the main general and flag bearer of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution. The glorious achievements of Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, and the Literary Research Association and the Creation Society during the May Fourth period undoubtedly belong to the proletarian-led literary cause. The problem is how to specifically explain the relationship between proletarian thought and their creative activities and worldviews; and the relationship between their creative activities and the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    Taking Lu Xun as an example, he was a revolutionary petty-bourgeois intellectual at that time, and his worldview was not yet historical materialism. However, he was the main general of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution, especially the founder of the "May Fourth" new literature. There is no contradiction in this. The united front of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution was composed of three parts: the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie, but there were only two lines of struggle within the united front. The petty bourgeoisie either stood on the side of the proletariat or on the side of the bourgeoisie. It was impossible to have an independent political line. Lu Xun stood on the side of the proletariat and resolutely carried out the thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. He said more than once that he wanted to "obey the orders of the revolutionary pioneers," "listen to the orders of the revolution," and was willing to honestly be a "vanguard of the revolutionary army." This is Lu Xun's basic political attitude. To study a writer, one must first look at his political attitude, but more importantly, his political attitude is truly and practically expressed in his literary practice. Before 1926, during his time in Beijing, he used his incomparably sharp essays as weapons to conduct the most correct, bravest, most resolute, and most loyal battles against the feudal restorationist "Jia Yin Weekly," "Xue Heng," the Westernized gentleman Chen Xiying and the "Modern Review" school, the warlord lackey Yang Yinyu, and Hu Shi, who surrendered to the feudal forces after 1921. He was truly a "fierce pioneer." Isn't the direction pointed by his cold and shining dagger the direction that the Party wanted to attack at that time? Wasn't his heroic struggle practicing the Party's revolutionary tasks at that time? And isn't his most precious "hard bone" character the fighting character of the working people? On the surface, Lu Xun seemed to be fighting alone at that time, but in reality, he represented the broad masses of the Chinese people and was supported by the revolutionary struggle led by the Party at that time.
    Lu Xun's "hard bone" character is combined with his tenacious fighting spirit, which is Lu Xun's outstanding style. The formation of his character is due to the fact that he was "fed by the milk of wild beasts" (Note 1); due to his deep understanding of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of China, the "rule of zombies," especially the stimulation given to him by the failure of the Revolution of 1911; and more importantly, due to the fact that the Chinese proletariat had already stepped onto the political stage, giving him encouragement and hope. Before the "May Fourth," he could only be a lonely "contemplation," but in the May Fourth period, he "shouted." The victory of the Russian October Revolution also made him initially see "the dawn of the new century." This hard-bone character and tenacious fighting spirit are very prominent in the essays he wrote at that time and later collected in "Hot Wind," "Grave," "Hua Gai Collection," and "Hua Gai Collection Sequel," and in his fictional works. It mainly reflects his attacks on class rule and his whipping of the liberalism of the Westernized gentlemen. In addition to giving fatal blows to those "gentlemen" and Westernized gentlemen, in articles such as "Late Spring Chat," "Random Notes Under the Lamp," and "Another Discussion on the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda," he made extremely sharp analyses and criticisms of class rule, demanding to "create this third era that has never existed in Chinese history," demanding to "sweep away these cannibals, overturn this feast, and destroy this kitchen," demanding to have "innovative destroyers, because there is an ideal light in their hearts," and for those "goat-like people who still have a small bell hanging on their necks as the badge of the intellectual class," or "flattering cats" and "pug-like" Chinese reactionary bourgeois intellectuals of all kinds who talk about reformism, humanitarianism, liberalism, and experimentalism, he gave a deep and painful whipping. This "hard bone" character was particularly prominent during the "March 18" massacre. He pointed out that "blood debts must be repaid with the same thing. The longer the delay, the greater the interest will be paid." At this time, Lu Xun actually foreshadowed a larger-scale class struggle was coming in his consciousness.
    During the "May Fourth" period, Lu Xun wrote nearly thirty novels, outstandingly creating a series of typical characters. In these novels, the sins of the feudal ethical code were mainly exposed, the rural reality of the Revolution of 1911 was reflected, and the decline of some individualistic intellectuals before and after the Revolution of 1911 was described. It can be said to be a mirror of Chinese history from the Revolution of 1911 to the May Fourth period. The profound social significance reflected in Lu Xun's novels sometimes even exceeded the author's own intentions. Taking "A Madman's Diary" as an example, as he himself said, it is "deeper and broader than Gogol's sorrow and indignation." This novel became the most powerful declaration of anti-feudalism in the "May Fourth" cultural revolution, and its characteristic lies in its thorough uncompromising and the sharpness of its analysis of reality. As for "The True Story of Ah Q," most commentators explore the topic of Ah Qism. Lu Xun himself also talked about the causes of this novel, which is undoubtedly important. But I think the greater significance that "The True Story of Ah Q" has achieved objectively lies in the thorough criticism of the compromise of the Revolution of 1911 and the presentation of the peasant problem through this image. Ah Q was sacrificed under the compromise of the bourgeoisie and the feudal class, that is, the Chinese peasant sacrificed under the "united front" of Zhao Taiye, Qian Xiucai, and the fake foreign devil. The Chinese peasants did not get any benefits from the Revolution of 1911, but suffered more persecution, which was reflected politically in the more brutal warlord rule after the Revolution of 1911. From the experience of the failure of the Revolution of 1911, Lu Xun deeply felt the importance of the peasant problem. Lu Xun raised this question in this and several other novels. He not only "mourned his misfortune," but more importantly "angered his unwillingness to fight." This raised the issue of peasants rising up to struggle. We don't need to say that Ah Q is a revolutionary to express the revolutionary significance of this novel. It is precisely because Ah Q is not a revolutionary that Lu Xun "angered his unwillingness to fight" and raised the issue of peasants wanting to fight. As for how to fight, this was naturally impossible for Lu Xun at that time to solve. The peasant problem is the central problem of the Chinese democratic revolution. The peasant's path to conscious revolution mainly lies not in solving the backwardness of their consciousness such as "numbness" and "self-deception," but in having a worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariat and solving the land problem. This problem was not correctly solved until later by Comrade Mao Zedong. And at the beginning of the establishment of the Party, that is, within the Party, the understanding of the worker-peasant alliance and the land problem was not clear enough, let alone Lu Xun? However, Lu Xun raised such a major historical issue. This was not easy for ordinary revolutionary intellectuals to achieve at that time. And this is completely different from the significance of the peasant problem raised by Tolstoy. There is no flavor of reformism here, but there is one thing that is similar, that is, as Lenin said, the Russian peasant problem raised by Tolstoy can only be solved by the Russian working class, then the Chinese peasant problem raised by Lu Xun in "The True Story of Ah Q" can only be solved by the Chinese working class. This is by no means a humanitarian problem as Hu Feng and his ilk say, but a revolutionary problem that Lu Xun felt but could not clearly understand and solve.
    Lu Xun was soberly and practically paying attention to social reality. For example, for young people, on the one hand, he placed great hopes on them, demanding that they rise up to "light the fire," but at the same time, he did not approve of the pursuit of individualistic "liberation" by petty-bourgeois youth, and pointed out its illusory nature. The "ideal" of the protagonist in "A Happy Family" was shattered by the housewife's slap. In "Regret for the Past," the disillusionment of Zijun's pursuit of "personal liberation" is described more profoundly. Zijun finally returned to her hometown and died. This is much more profound and practical than some naive and superficial works describing young people's dreams, but his understanding of how young people should specifically participate in the revolution was not as clear as it was later. He only believed that new forces would always win. The reason why Lu Xun saw it more deeply was because he personally saw the decline of many individualistic intellectuals who had once fantasized about freedom and equality after the Revolution of 1911. These are some of the characters he described in "In the Tavern" and "The Solitary." In the above novels, not only the most sober characteristics of realism are expressed, but also his simple materialist ideas can be seen.
    Lu Xun embodied the revolutionary demands of the masses of the people and the proletariat at that time through artistic practice. In his correct, brave, resolute, and loyal battles, some views objectively conformed to historical materialism. It is in this sense that Lu Xun was the main general and flag bearer of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution under the leadership of proletarian thought.
    Of course, we don't need to shy away from the limitations of Lu Xun's worldview during this period. This is a common feature of intellectuals in the transitional period to collectivism. In Lu Xun's essays and novels, there are still remnants of evolutionism and even nihilistic colors.
    Here, I will only talk about the so-called "transforming national character" or "national inferiority" that Lu Xun talked about.
    Lu Xun analyzed the spiritual weaknesses of the peasants in "The True Story of Ah Q" and other novels, which is realistic and necessary, but as mentioned earlier, the spiritual weaknesses of the peasants cannot be the only or main reason why the peasants cannot consciously rise up to fight. The peasants also have their strong and fighting side, which Lu Xun may have seen less. The issue of transforming national character should essentially be the issue of raising people's awareness, or the issue of revolutionary enlightenment. This issue can only be gradually resolved in the revolutionary struggles of the masses of the people. It is impossible to rely solely on literature without mass struggle. For example, the "May Fourth" cultural movement is inseparable from the "May Fourth" patriotic movement. China's backwardness is mainly due to the oppression of imperialism and the feudal class, not the problem of "national inferiority." Lu Xun understood this point, but he was not very clear in his understanding of how to change this situation through the peasant revolution led by the proletariat. The contradiction between the residual thoughts of evolutionism and the vague view of social revolution often made him fall into distress. I think the coming of nihilistic emotions is related to this. From 1924 to 1926, when writing some prose in "Weeds," I am afraid that this contradiction reached its most intense. After this intense contradiction, in the wave of the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, he finally found the road of Marxism.
    Lu Xun created the outstanding image of Ah Q. His subjective intention was to transform national character, but what he achieved objectively was the issue of how a peasant should rise up to fight. Therefore, when analyzing this work, I think the focus should be here, and not just entangled in the issue of "national inferiority." Of course, it is absurd for Hu Feng and his ilk to use Ah Q to promote their set of "spiritual slavery trauma" "theory," and in essence to slander the people.
    During this period, this limitation in Lu Xun's worldview was not enough to hide his brilliant brilliance. Since his creation took the same steps as the communists, his thoughts must have already begun to have the buds of socialist thought, that is, the vague view of social revolution reflected in his works. Simple materialism was the main thing in his worldview at that time. And only in this way can the leap in his thought after 1927 be explained.
    In this way, his creative method began to take a further step from critical realism after the "May Fourth" and has new characteristics, that is, it began to have the elements of socialist realism, although this element was only in a budding state. It is not necessary to search for these elements from the lines of his works as some people do (such as the wreath or crow in "Medicine," etc.). It is mainly because he has begun to accept some of the influence of the proletarian social revolution theory on his understanding of reality, and fundamentally negates the bourgeois reformism. His simple materialistic worldview is closely combined with actual combat, so that his creation can serve the interests of the proletarian revolution and the masses of the people. The revolutionary spirit manifested in his essays in particular is not possessed by the European critical realist writers of the nineteenth century. However, he had not yet established a communist worldview at that time. Although he affirmed that the new forces would surely win, he did not know how it would win, so he could not describe the future trend of reality in his works at that time. Therefore, it can only be said that it is a budding element. This element gradually became clear and developed in his works after 1927.
    In addition to Lu Xun, another representative writer during the "May Fourth" period must be Guo Moruo. Guo Moruo began writing poetry in 1919. He showed brilliant talent as soon as he appeared. His positive romantic spirit and artistic originality brought strong life to the new poetry of the "May Fourth" and immediately overshadowed the new poetry of the "Attempt Collection" and the like. More importantly, his poetry had a great political and ideological influence on the youth at that time. His earliest poems, such as "The Goddess" and "Nirvana of the Phoenix," although they only expressed the spirit of thoroughly destroying the old and creating the new, had a huge effect on the anger of the youth during the "May Fourth" period who broke through the old barriers and pursued the light, that is, the thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. Guo Moruo's early thought was influenced by many aspects and was relatively complex. He had the idea of ​​pantheism (actually the idea of ​​atheism), the idea of ​​pure art, and also the preliminary idea of ​​socialism. His "Three Pantheists" praised Zhuangzi, Spinoza, and Kapir, and at the same time praised them as "people who make a living by working." In poetry, he accepted the influence of various people such as Whitman, Goethe, and Tagore. He praised all "rebels," and he himself was a "rebel poet" with high passion. In the "Ode to Bandits" in 1919 and the "Lessons of the Giant Cannon" in the following year, he praised all the democratic revolutionaries in history, and also praised Marx, Engels, and Lenin; he praised Tolstoy, and also praised the October Revolution. He formally accepted Marxism in 1924, but in the paper "Our New Literary Movement" written in 1923, he had already pointed out that Hu Shi's literary reform movement "has too deep Bourgeois (bourgeois) roots in those who advocate and agree with it," and advocated "completely overthrowing the evil roots," and proposed to "resist the poisonous dragon of capitalism." This is a very clear revolutionary attitude, and shortly after accepting Marxism in the following year, he participated in the Great Revolution of 1925-1927 and the "August 1" Uprising, and has been unswervingly serving the cause of the Party.
    This also shows that during the "May Fourth" period, as a revolutionary poet transitioning to collectivism, in the complex and contradictory content of his worldview and artistic thought, the dominant thought was still materialism and revolutionary democracy, and in creation, he tended to revolutionary romanticism. Although there was a claim for pure art in the early days of the Creation Society, and some poems also reflected this tendency (this is related to his lack of direct contact with domestic revolutionary practice during his time in Japan before the "May Fourth"), this is not his main thing. And precisely because of this, he quickly abandoned that pure art tendency, put forward the proposition of revolutionary literature, and participated in the revolutionary struggle led by the Party. In basic political attitude, he is consistent with Lu Xun. Therefore, when commenting on Lu Xun and Guo Moruo during the "May Fourth" period, it can only be said that their creative genres are different, and they cannot be opposed.
    Guo Moruo's romanticism added a strong color to the "May Fourth" literature. There are individualistic things in this, but also the spirit of collectivism, and the latter is becoming more and more the main content. Guo Moruo's romanticism is based on reality and combined with realism. It also reflects the thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal demands in the real struggle at that time. This is the same as the romantic spirit in Lu Xun's works. Although Lu Xun's realistic spirit is more prominent, Guo Moruo's romantic spirit is more prominent, becoming the two major genres in literature at that time. But even in art, they should not be absolutely opposed, because in the overall trend, they are all revolutionary democratic literature under the leadership of proletarian thought.
    Lu Xun and Guo Moruo are both models of Chinese intellectuals constantly transforming themselves in the revolution. Lu Xun always dissects himself and never hides himself. This spirit of self-transformation made him finally become a great communist.
    The other two representative writers during the May Fourth period were Qu Qiubai and Shen Yanbing. Qu Qiubai was a communist intellectual very early and was an outstanding writer within the Party at that time. His "First Swallow of the New Literary Era in Red Russia" was the first to introduce Soviet literature, pointing out that true culture is only the culture of the proletariat. His poems have the spirit of revolutionary romanticism. Later, he gave Lu Xun a lot of help. But at that time, his main energy was in the Party's activities, and he spent less time engaged in literary activities. Shen Yanbing (Mao Dun) had not engaged in creation during the "May Fourth" period, but he led the Literary Research Association and made great contributions to the development of revolutionary realist literature. He demanded that literature be able to shoulder "the important responsibility of awakening the people and giving them strength," and opposed "closing their eyes and meditating on the seven-treasure towers in their dreams, and forgetting that they are actually living in pigsties" (Note 2). This is the proposition of revolutionary utilitarianism in literature. He had contact with the Party very early, and his literary work during the "May Fourth" period was carried out under the direct leadership of the Party. However, his own creative activities started after 1927, so I will not comment on them here.
    Of course, there were many other revolutionary writers during the "May Fourth" period, and I cannot comment on them one by one here. At that time, all patriotic writers could be said to be members of the New Democratic cultural front and made certain contributions to the "May Fourth" movement. From the above, it can also be briefly explained how the New Literature Movement, an important wing of the "May Fourth" cultural revolution, grew and developed under the leadership of the proletariat and the Party, just as "On New Democracy" said, "Its momentum is so great and its power is so fierce that it is simply invincible." The reason why it is so is because it correctly practiced the tasks of the Chinese revolution pointed out by the Party, served the interests of the proletariat and the masses of the people, and thus was able to fully exert the power of realism in art. The entire revolutionary literary history of China over the past forty years realistically illustrates the truth of the relationship between revolutionary politics and revolutionary literature. And now is the time for us to seriously and scientifically summarize these experiences.

    “五四”文学的发展道路
    邵荃麟
    为了正确地评价五四时期的革命文学，我想首先要说明一下当时文学运动的一些情况。
      “五四”新文化运动的性质及其历史特点，“新民主主义论”中已经作了极其精辟的科学论断，这是在俄国十月革命的影响下和由中国共产党人所领导的共产主义的文化思想运动。这就决定了新文学运动，只能朝着社会主义方向发展的革命道路，只能由无产阶级文化思想去领导。五四时期，新民主主义文化革命还是在最初阶段。在这个阶段中，政治的中心任务是彻底反对帝国主义和军阀统治；文学的中心任务则是“反对了封建古装的旧文学和文言文，提倡了以反帝反封建为内容的新文学和白话文”。无产阶级的文化思想——共产主义宇宙观和社会革命论，是通过文学界的统一战线来发挥其领导作用的。当时统一战线的内部也就有了斗争，即无产阶级和革命小资产阶级所坚持的彻底不妥协的反帝国主义、反封建主义和资产阶级所主张的妥协的改良主义的斗争。这个斗争准备着后来无产阶级和资产阶级的分裂，形成四十年来文学上两条道路的斗争。革命小资产阶级文学家在无产阶级思想领导下，逐步走上集体主义的革命道路，而反动的资产阶级文学家则走向反人民的道路。革命文学的队伍，正如鲁迅所说“愈到后来，这支队伍也就愈成为纯粹、精锐的队伍了”。“五四”以后文学的发展，就是沿着这样一条道路——革命民主主义向共产主义思想的发展，而决定它的则是无产阶级思想的领导。1921年党成立后，它在文化方面的任务是团结广大知识分子和人民大众为坚持彻底的民主革命而斗争。那时，共产主义思想的宣传已经深入到知识分子和青年学生中间，在文学上也产生了极大的影响，但是在党刚刚建立的时候，无产阶级的文学家还极少，还很不成熟，不可能一下就形成自己的队伍，还不能立即展开像后来那样规模的无产阶级的文学运动。党只有直接和间接地通过革命小资产阶级作家来领导文学。
  （在党成立以前，则由一些共产主义知识分子团结和影响这些作家进行文学运动。）苏联的革命文学理论和作品，当时都还没有大量被介绍到中国来，也还说不上马克思主义文艺理论的建设。当时主要的任务是把无产阶级和劳动人民的政治要求，体现到文学创作中去。社会主义现实主义还是在孕育和萌芽的初期，虽然这种因素却是引导文学逐步向集体主义思想发展的决定性因素。
    “五四”初期的革命作家，如鲁迅、郭沫若等，大都是在走向集体主义道路的过渡时期中，他们看到了辛亥革命的失败教训，看到了帝国主义国家的瓦解和受伤，看到了十月革命的胜利，使他们一方面坚决与帝国主义和封建主义进行斗争，否定了中国走资本主义道路的可能性；另一方面，他们对革命的理想还是在蒙胧的状态中，不可能一下就成为马克思主义者。在他们的世界观中，存在着新与旧的矛盾。然而无论如何，新的东西，即唯物主义的成份是在生长发展，并且是占主导地位的。在政治上他们是肯定党所提出的彻底的民主革命的纲领。这使他们在思想上具有“五四”前中国知识分子还不曾有过的革命民主主义的特色。正是由于这样，才使他们能够在作品中体现了当时人民大众的革命要求，也即是无产阶级和党的政治斗争要求，才使党能够通过他们来领导当时的文学。
    以上所述，是为了说明五四时期无产阶级思想和党对于文学的领导，也说明当时文学运动形势与后来不同的地方。在评价“五四”文学的时候，我们首先要彻底驳斥掉胡风反革命集团和修正主义分子的那种把“五四”文学运动看作是资产阶级所领导的反动论点（将在
  “人民文学”五月号发表的本文前一段中已另有论述），但我们也不能用现在对社会主义文学的要求去衡量，应该根据当时的历史情况去进行评价。以前有个时候，在有些人中间，似乎存在过这么一种简单看法：认为五四时期的作品既然极大多数是小资产阶级作家的作品，所以也就把它们看作单纯的小资产阶级的文学，忽略了它们是无产阶级思想领导下的革命文学的意义，因而有意无意地贬低了它的历史价值；在目前也还有些人对“五四”以来的新诗采取一笔抹煞的态度。这种看法是不正确的。相反，如果只就当时一些共产主义知识分子或党员所写的作品来说明党对“五四”文学的领导，那也是很不够的。毫无疑问，像李大钊关于文化和文学的论文，以及瞿秋白的作品和介绍苏联文学的论文等，是有极重要意义的，它们在文学思想上提出了鲜明的革命主张。但文学主要是靠创作来表现。一般说，当时无产阶级的成熟的作家极少，所以党还必须通过一些杰出的革命小资产阶级作家来领导文学。鲁迅成为“五四”文化革命的主将和旗手，就是如此。五四时期，鲁迅、郭沫若以及文学研究会和创造社的辉煌功绩，无疑地是属于无产阶级领导的文学事业的功绩。问题是在于如何具体地说明无产阶级思想对于他们创作活动和世界观的关系；以及他们的创作活动对于无产阶级革命事业的关系。
    以鲁迅来说，他当时是革命的小资产阶级知识分子，他的世界观还不是历史唯物主义的，然而他是“五四”文化革命的主将，尤其是“五四”新文学的奠基者。这并没有什么矛盾。“五四”文化革命的统一战线固然由无产阶级、小资产阶级和资产阶级三部分人所组成，但统一战线内部却只有两条路线的斗争。小资产阶级不是站在无产阶级这一面，就是站在资产阶级那一面，它不可能有独立的政治路线。鲁迅是站在无产阶级这一面，坚决进行彻底反帝反封建的斗争的。他不止一次说过，要“遵革命前驱者之命”，“听革命的将令”，愿意诚实地做一个“革命军马前卒”。这是鲁迅的基本政治态度。研究一个作家，首先要看他的政治态度，但更重要的是，他的这种政治态度是真刀真枪地表现在他的文学实践里。1926年以前他在北京期间，以锋利无比的杂文为武器，向当时的封建复古派的“甲寅周刊”、“学衡”、欧化绅士陈西滢和“现代评论”派、军阀走狗杨荫榆以及1921年后向封建势力投降的胡适等人，进行了最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实的战斗。那真是“凶猛的闯将”。他那冷光闪闪的匕首所指的方向，不正是那时党所要打击的方向吗？他那种英勇的斗争，不正是实践了党在那时候的革命任务吗？而他那种最可宝贵的“硬骨头”的性格，不也正是劳动人民的战斗性格吗？从表面上看，那时鲁迅仿佛是孤军奋斗，然而实际上他却是代表了广大中国人民，并且由当时党所领导的革命斗争所支持的。
    鲁迅的这种“硬骨头”性格是和他那种韧性的战斗精神结合在一起的，这是鲁迅突出的风格。他这种性格的形成，是由于他是“野兽的奶汁所喂养大的”（注一）；由于他深刻理解中国这个“僵尸的统治”的半封建半殖民地社会，特别是辛亥革命的失败所给予他的刺激；而更重要的，由于中国无产阶级已经登上政治舞台，给予了他以鼓舞和希望。“五四”以前，他还只能是孤独的“沉思”，而在五四时期，他就“呐喊”起来了。俄国十月革命的胜利，也使他最初看到了“新世纪的曙光”，这种硬骨头的性格和韧性战斗精神，在他那时所写下来、后来收集在“热风”、“坟”、“华盖集”和“华盖集续编”中的杂文中和他的小说创作中都十分突出。主要是反映出他对于阶级统治的攻击和对于欧化绅士们的自由主义的鞭挞。除了给予那些“正人君子”和欧化绅士们的致命的打击以外，像在“春末闲谈”、“灯下漫笔”、“再论雷峰塔的倒掉”等文章中，对阶级统治作了极锐利的剖解和抨击，要求“创造这中国历史上未曾有过的第三样时代”，要求“扫荡这些食人者，掀掉这筵席，毁坏这厨房”，要求有“革新的破坏者，因为他内心有理想的光”，而对于那种“脖子上还挂着一个小铃铎，作为知识阶级的徽章的山羊式的”，或“媚态的猫”和“叭儿狗”式的各色各样高谈改良主义、人道主义、自由主义、实验主义的中国反动资产阶级知识分子，则一律予以深恶痛绝的鞭挞。这种“硬骨头”性格到了“三一八”惨案时，显得尤其突出。他指出了“血债必须用同物偿还。拖欠得愈久，就要付更大的利息”。这时在鲁迅意识中实际上已经预感一个更大规模的阶级斗争将要到来了。
    “五四”时期鲁迅写下了近三十篇小说，杰出地创造了一系列的典型人物。在这些小说中，主要是暴露了封建礼教的罪恶，反映了辛亥革命时代的农村现实，描写了辛亥革命前后一些个人主义知识分子的没落，可以说是辛亥革命到五四时期中国历史的一面镜子。鲁迅小说中所反映出的深刻的社会意义，有时甚至是超过了作者自己的意图。以“狂人日记”来说，正如他自己所说“比果戈理的忧愤深广”。这篇小说成为“五四”文化革命中反封建主义的最有力的一篇宣言，其特征就在于它的那种彻底的不妥协性，以及对于现实剖解的锐利性。再就“阿Q正传”来说，论者多半就阿Q主义这个题目来探讨。鲁迅自己也说过这篇小说的成因，这毫无疑问是重要的。但我以为“阿Q正传”在客观上所达到的更大意义，倒是在于通过这个形象彻底批判了辛亥革命的妥协性和提出了农民问题这两点上。阿Q是在资产阶级和封建阶级妥协下牺牲的，即在赵太爷、钱秀才和假洋鬼子的“联合战线”下牺牲的中国农民。中国农民从辛亥革命中没有得到一点好处，反而遭受了更多的迫害，反映到政治上就是辛亥革命以后更残暴的军阀统治。从辛亥革命的失败经验中，鲁迅深深感到农民问题的重要。在这篇和其他几篇小说中，鲁迅提出了这个问题。他不仅是“哀其不幸”，更主要的是“怒其不争”。这就是提出了农民要起来斗争的问题。我们大可不必把阿Q说成是个革命者来表示这篇小说的革命意义，正是因为阿Q还不是革命者，所以鲁迅才“怒其不争”，才提出农民要争的问题。至于怎么争法，这自然是当时的鲁迅所不可能解决的。农民问题是中国民主革命的中心问题。农民的走向自觉革命，主要不在于解决其意识上的“麻木”“自欺”等落后性，而在于要有无产阶级领导的工农联盟和解决土地问题。这个问题一直到后来由毛泽东同志来正确解决。而在党初建立时，即在党内，对于工农联盟和土地问题的认识也是不够明确的，那又何况于鲁迅呢？然而鲁迅却提出了这样一个重大的历史问题。这是当时一般革命知识分子所不易达到的。而且这和托尔斯泰所提出的农民问题意义完全不同。这里没有一些改良主义的气味，然而有一点倒是相似的，就是列宁说的，托尔斯泰提出的俄国农民问题，只有俄国工人阶级才能解决，那末鲁迅从“阿Q正传”中所提的中国农民问题，也只有中国工人阶级才能解决。这绝不是胡风之流所说的什么人道主义的问题，而是鲁迅所感到然而还不能明确认识和解决的革命问题。
    鲁迅是清醒地实际地注视着社会现实的。例如对于青年，他一方面是寄以极大的希望，要求他们起来“点火”，但同时对于小资产阶级青年那种追求个人主义的“解放”，他是不赞成的，而且指出其虚幻。“幸福的家庭”里那个主人公的“理想”就给主妇“拍”的一巴掌打破了。在“伤逝”里则更深刻地描写了子君的那种争取“个人解放”的幻灭。子君终于回到老家去，而且死了。这比当时一些天真地、浮泛地描写青年梦想的作品要深刻和实际得多，然而对青年怎样具体去参加革命，他的认识还没有后来那样明确，只是相信新生力量总是要胜利。鲁迅之所以看得更为深刻，是因为他亲眼看到了辛亥革命后不少曾经幻想过自由平等的个人主义知识分子的没落。这就是他在“在酒楼上”、“孤独者”中所描写的一些人物。在上述这些小说里，不但表现了最清醒的现实主义的特色，也可以看到他朴素的唯物主义的思想。
    鲁迅是通过艺术实践来体现当时人民大众和无产阶级的革命要求的。在他那种正确、勇敢、坚决、忠实的战斗中间，有些看法是客观上符合于历史唯物主义的。正是在这样意义上，说明了鲁迅是无产阶级思想领导下的“五四”文化革命的主将和旗手。
    当然，我们也不必讳言鲁迅在这个时期世界观上局限的一面。这在走向集体主义的过渡时期中的知识分子是普遍的特征。在鲁迅那些杂文和小说里面也还保留有进化论的残余，甚至虚无主义的色彩。
    这里只谈一谈鲁迅所说到过的所谓“改造国民性”或“国民劣根性”的问题。
    鲁迅在“阿Q正传”和其他小说中剖解了农民精神上的弱点，这是现实的和必要的，但正如前面说过，农民精神上的弱点并不能作为农民不能自觉起来斗争的唯一的或主要的理由。农民还有他们坚强和斗争的一面，这一面鲁迅也许看得较少。改造国民性的问题，实质应该是提高人民觉悟的问题，或革命的启蒙主义的问题。这个问题只有在人民群众的革命斗争中才能逐步解决。离开群众斗争，单靠文学是不行的。例如“五四”文化运动就和“五四”爱国运动分不开。中国的落后，主要由于帝国主义、封建阶级的压迫，而不是“国民劣根性”的问题。这一点鲁迅是明白的，然而对于怎样通过无产阶级领导的农民革命来改变这种情况，鲁迅在认识上却不很明确，进化论的残余思想和蒙胧的社会革命论观点的矛盾，使他常常陷于苦闷之中。虚无主义情感之来，我以为和这有关。1924—1926年，写“野草”中的一些散文时，恐怕是他这种矛盾达到最剧烈的时候，经过这一段剧烈的矛盾，在1925—1927年大革命的浪潮中，终于使他找到了马克思主义的道路。
    鲁迅创造出阿Q这个杰出形象，他的主观上固然有改造国民性的意图，但是客观上所达到的，却是一个农民如何起来斗争的问题。所以在分析这篇作品时，我以为着重点应在这里，而不要只纠缠在“国民劣根性”的问题上。当然，像胡风之流利用阿Q来宣传他们那套“精神奴役创伤”的“理论”，而实质上是为了诬蔑人民，那是荒谬绝伦了。
    这个时期，鲁迅世界观中的这种局限性，并不足以隐掩他灿烂的光辉。他在创作上既然和共产主义者取一致步调，他的思想中当然也已经开始有了社会主义思想的萌芽，也即是反映在他作品中那种蒙胧的社会革命观点。朴素的唯物主义才是他当时世界观中主要的东西。而只有这样才能说明1927年以后他思想上的飞跃。
    这样，也就使他的创作方法在“五四”以后开始从批判现实主义突进一步，具有新的特质，即开始有了社会主义现实主义的因素，虽然这种因素还只是萌芽状态的东西。这倒不必像有些人那样从他作品的字里行间去找寻这些因素（例如“药”里的花环或乌鸦等等），主要是由于他对现实的认识上，已经开始接受了一些无产阶级社会革命论的影响，根本否定了资产阶级的改良主义。他的朴素的唯物主义的世界观是和实际战斗紧密地结合在一起的，使他的创作能够服务于无产阶级革命和人民大众的利益，特别在他的杂文中所表现出来的革命精神，是十九世纪欧洲批判现实主义作家所没有的。然而他在当时还没有建立起共产主义的世界观，对于现实的发展，虽然肯定新的力量一定会胜利，但又不甚明了它如何胜利，所以在当时作品中就不能描写出现实的未来趋向，因此只能说是萌芽状态的因素，这种因素在1927年以后，就在他的作品中逐渐明确和发展起来了。
    除鲁迅外，“五四”时期另一个代表作家，当然要推郭沫若了。郭沫若1919年就开始写诗。他一出现就显示了光辉的天才。他那种积极的浪漫主义的精神和艺术上的独创性，给“五四”的新诗歌带来了强烈的生命，立刻把“尝试集”一类新诗掩盖了。而更主要的，是他的诗歌对当时青年起了很大的政治和思想影响。他最早的诗如“女神”“凤凰涅磐”等，虽然只是表现了彻底毁灭旧的、产生新的那种追求精神，但对于“五四”时期青年中间那种冲决旧的藩篱追求光明的怒潮，也即是彻底的反帝反封建的斗争，却起了巨大的作用。郭沫若早期的思想是受多方面的影响，比较庞杂的。他有泛神论的思想（实际上是无神论的思想），有纯艺术的思想，也有初步的社会主义的思想。他的“三个泛神论者”赞美了庄子、斯宾诺莎和加皮尔，而同时又赞美他们是“靠劳动吃饭的人”。在诗歌上，他接受惠特曼、歌德、泰戈尔等各种人的影响，他赞颂一切“叛逆者”，而他自己就是一个具有高度激情的“叛逆诗人”。1919年的“匪徒颂”和次年的“巨炮之教训”中，他赞颂历史上一切民主革命者，也赞颂了马克思、恩格斯、列宁；他赞颂了托尔斯泰，也赞颂了十月革命。他正式接受马克思主义是在1924年，但在1923年所写的“我们的文学新运动”论文中，已经指出胡适的文学改良运动，是“Bourgeois（资产阶级）的根性，在那些提倡者与附和者之中是植根太深了”，主张“把恶根性和盘推翻”，提出了要“反抗资本主义的毒龙”，这是十分鲜明的革命态度，而在次年接受了马克思主义以后不久，就参加了1925—1927年的大革命和“八一”起义，一直坚定不移地为党的事业服务。
    这也说明，在“五四”时期作为向集体主义过渡的革命诗人，在他世界观和艺术思想的复杂和矛盾内容中，作为其主导思想的，仍然是唯物主义和革命民主主义，而在创作上则倾向于革命浪漫主义。尽管在创造社初期有过纯艺术的主张，在某一些诗中也反映了这种倾向（这和他“五四”前在日本时期，没有直接接触国内革命实践是有关系的），但这不是他主要的东西。而正由于这样，他就很快抛弃了那种纯艺术的倾向，提出了革命文学的主张，而且参加党所领导的革命斗争了。在基本政治态度上他和鲁迅是一致的。所以在评论“五四”时期鲁迅和郭沫若时，只能说他们在创作上流派的不同，而不能把他们对立起来。
    郭沫若的浪漫主义，给“五四”文学增加了强烈的色彩。这中间有个人主义的东西，但也有集体主义的精神，而后者愈来愈成为主要的内容，郭沫若的浪漫主义是建立于现实基础之上，和现实主义相结合的，它同样反映了当时现实斗争中彻底反帝反封建的要求。这和鲁迅的作品中也具有浪漫主义的精神一样。虽然，鲁迅的现实主义精神更为突出，而郭沫若的浪漫主义精神则更为突出，成为当时文学上两大流派。但即使在艺术上也不应把它们绝对对立起来，因为在总的倾向上，都是无产阶级思想领导下的革命民主主义文学。
    鲁迅和郭沫若都是中国知识分子在革命中不断进行自我改造的典范。鲁迅总是经常在解剖自己，从不掩饰自己，这种自我改造精神使他终于成为一个伟大的共产主义者。
    五四时期另外两位代表作家是瞿秋白和沈雁冰。瞿秋白很早就是共产主义知识分子，是当时党内的杰出作家。他的“赤俄新文艺时代的第一燕”最早介绍了苏联文学，指出真正的文化只是无产阶级的文化。他的诗具有革命浪漫主义的精神。后来他又给鲁迅以很大的帮助。但当时他主要精力是在党的活动方面，从事文学活动的时间较少。沈雁冰（茅盾）在“五四”时期还没有从事创作，但是领导了文学研究会，为发展革命现实主义文学，作出很大的贡献。他要求文学能够担当“唤醒民众而给他们力量的重大责任”，反对“闭了眼睛冥想他们梦中的七宝楼台，而忘记了自身实在是住在猪圈里”（注二）。这是文学上革命功利主义的主张。他很早就和党接触，“五四”时期他的文学工作是在党直接领导下进行的。但是他自己的创作活动，却是1927年以后开始，所以这里不加以评述了。
    当然，“五四”时期还有不少其他革命作家，不能在这里一一评述。当时凡是爱国主义的作家，可以说都是新民主主义文化战线中的成员，都为“五四”运动作出一定贡献。从上所述，也可以简单地说明“五四”文化革命重要的一翼的新文学运动，是怎样在无产阶级和党领导之下成长、发展起来，正如“新民主主义论”里说，
  “其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，简直是所向无敌的”。其所以如此，是因为它正确地实践了党所指出的中国革命的任务，服务于无产阶级和人民大众的利益，因而在艺术上才能充分发挥现实主义的力量。四十年来的中国全部革命文艺历史是现实地说明革命政治与革命文艺相互关系的真理。而现在应该是我们认真地科学地来总结这些经验的时候了。
