Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 17th. The dozens of agricultural loan work teams dispatched by the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have, according to preliminary statistics over the past month or so, distributed more than 3.5 million jin of interest-free seeds and grain to poor peasants in various parts of Tibet. This has solved the widespread shortage of seeds and grain in rural areas caused by the exploitation of serf owners, and enabled the spring ploughing and sowing in vast agricultural areas to be completed successfully. The amount of interest-free seed grain distributed this year is greater than in previous years, and the scope of distribution is also larger. From Qamdo in the eastern plateau to Ngari in the western plateau, from the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin in the central region to the remote Himalayan mountains, many farmers whose homes were looted by the rebel bandits and those who lacked seed grain due to the exploitation of serf owners have now received interest-free seed grain. Poor farmers in more than 20 zong (districts) and xi (townships) in the Lhasa River Valley, including Mozhugongka, Deqing, Dazi, Pangduo, Damxung, Yangbajing, Doilungdêqên, Dongga, Naiwu, Qushui, Nangru, and Zemulin, have received agricultural loans, of which poor farmers in 12 zong (districts) and xi (townships) have received more than 1.7 million jin of seed grain. In Naidong Zong in Shannan, which was once occupied by the rebel bandits, most of the farmers had their seeds and food grain looted, and a large amount of arable land could not be cultivated due to the lack of seeds. As soon as the People's Liberation Army's pacification troops arrived, they distributed interest-free seeds and grain to farmers lacking seeds, averaging more than 200 jin of highland barley per household, and also transferred a batch of livestock to plough the land for farmers lacking animal power. Poor farmers in Qamdo Zong, Ningjing Zong, and Jiangda Zong in the Qamdo area also received an average of fifty or sixty jin of interest-free loan grain per household, and also received one or two new-style farm tools free of charge. In the Nyang Chu River basin in Xigazê and Gyangzê, the amount of agricultural loans distributed this year has also greatly increased compared to previous years. In the past month, more than 12,000 poor farmers have received more than 1.5 million jin of seed grain, enabling many previously barren farmlands due to lack of seeds to be planted with crops again.

In the past, when Tibetan farmers lacked seed grain during the spring ploughing season, they had to borrow usurious loans from the former Tibetan local government and serf owners. Borrowing seed grain generally involved borrowing in the spring and repaying in the autumn, borrowing four *ke* and repaying five *ke*, or borrowing three *ke* and repaying four *ke*, and sometimes borrowing five *ke* and repaying ten *ke*. The interest rate for half a year ranged from 25% to 100%. Some farmers' labor for a year was not enough to repay the seed grain debt. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government distributed interest-free agricultural loans to farmers every year, but the reactionary Tibetan government and a few serf owners did their utmost to obstruct this, either threatening farmers not to receive loans from the work teams, or seizing the seed grain borrowed by farmers for their own use, so that many farmers still suffered from the usurious exploitation of serf owners. This year, Tibetan farmers have truly been liberated from the shackles of usurious loans.

The agricultural loan work teams are warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers wherever they go. Many farmers who lack seed grain call the work teams "life-saving Buddhas." Danjiu Jiangba, a farmer in the western suburbs of Lhasa, borrowed ten *ke* of highland barley from a headman in his grandfather's time due to a lack of seed grain. For more than 60 years, he had been repaying it every year, but he was never able to pay it off. Now, those ten *ke* of seed grain had "snowballed" into one hundred *ke*. This time, just when he was worried and helpless due to the lack of seed grain, the agricultural loan work team distributed interest-free seed grain to him. Danjiu Jiangba said excitedly: "Without the Communist Party, our farmers would never be able to stand up. We must follow the Communist Party!"

Currently, the agricultural loan work teams are continuing to go deeper into more remote mountain villages to distribute interest-free agricultural loans. They plan to deliver the seeds and grain to every poor farmer before the spring ploughing and sowing. (Attached picture)

    把贫苦农民从农奴主的高利贷枷锁下解放出来
    西藏发放无息种粮350万斤
    西藏工委和军区派出几十个农贷工作队帮助农民播下幸福的种子
    新华社拉萨17日电　中共西藏工委和人民解放军西藏军区派出的几十个农贷工作队，最近一个多月以来据初步统计，已经为西藏各地贫苦农民发放了三百五十多万斤无息种子和粮食，从而解决了农村中由于农奴主的压榨而普遍缺种缺粮的困难，使广大农业区的春耕播种得以胜利完成。今年发放的无息种粮数量比往年多，发放的地区范围也比往年大。从东部高原的昌都到西部高原的阿里地区，从中部雅鲁藏布江流域到边远的喜马拉雅山区，许多被叛匪劫掠一空的农户和因遭受农奴主剥削缺少种粮的农户，现在都领到了无息种粮。拉萨河谷的墨竹工卡、德庆、达孜、旁多、当雄、羊巴井、堆龙德庆、东噶、乃乌、曲水、囊如、泽木林等二十多个宗、溪的贫苦农户都领到了农贷，其中十二个宗、溪的贫苦农户就领到了一百七十多万斤种粮。曾被叛匪一度盘据的山南乃东宗绝大部分农户的种子和口粮都被叛匪抢走，大批耕地因缺乏种子无法耕种。人民解放军平叛部队一到，就为缺种农户发放无息种子和粮食，平均每户发放了二百多斤青稞，还抽调一批牲畜为缺乏畜力的农户翻地。昌都地区的昌都宗、宁静宗、江达宗的贫苦农民，平均每户也领到了五、六十斤无息贷粮，还得到了一、二件无偿的新式农具。在年楚河流域的日喀则和江孜一带，今年发放的农贷数量也比往年大大增多。在过去的一个月中，有一万二千多户贫苦农民得到了一百五十多万斤种粮，使许多过去因缺种而荒芜的耕地又种上了庄稼。
    过去，西藏农民春耕时缺少种粮，只有向原西藏地方政府和农奴主借高利贷。借种粮一般是春借秋还，借四克还五克，借三克还四克，有的借五克还十克，半年中的利率从25％到100％，有些农民劳累一年所得，还不够偿还种粮债。西藏和平解放后，中央人民政府每年都向农民发放无息农贷，但西藏反动政权和少数农奴主却百般阻挠，或者威胁农民不准向工作队领借，或者把农民领借到的种粮据为己有，使许多农民仍遭受农奴主的高利贷剥削。今年，西藏农民们才真正从高利贷的枷锁下解放出来。
    农贷工作队每到一地，都受到广大农民们的热烈欢迎。许多缺乏种粮的农民把工作队称为“救命的佛爷”。拉萨西郊农民丹久降巴，他祖父时代因缺种粮向头人借了十克青稞，六十多年来年年偿还，一直偿还不清，现在十克种粮已“滚”成一百克了。这次，正当他又因缺种粮而愁得没有办法的时候，农贷工作队给他发了无息种粮。丹久降巴激动地说：“没有共产党，我们农民永远也不会出头，我们一定要跟共产党走！”
    目前，农贷工作队正继续深入到更偏远的山村去发放无息农贷。他们计划在春耕播种以前，把种子和粮食送到每一个贫苦农民手里。（附图片）
