　　Several Suggestions on Scientific Research Work in the Electric Power Industry
    Speech by Deputy Xu Shigao

    I warmly support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    Under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all nationalities in our country have united as one and achieved a great victory in the First Five-Year Plan. Through the nationwide rectification campaign, the struggle against the rightists, and the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals, and under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, an unprecedented Great Leap Forward emerged on all fronts of industry, agriculture, culture, and education in 1958, achieving brilliant successes. The people of the whole country are striving forward and fighting to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. This inspiring and brilliant scene is exhilarating!

    Now, I would like to talk about some of my experiences and opinions on the scientific research work of the electric power industry, and I ask for your criticism and correction.

    In recent years, the scientific research work of the electric power industry has greatly developed under the care and correct leadership of the Party. Now, in addition to the research institutions directly under the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, which have a certain scale, all provinces (cities) and autonomous regions have also established experimental research departments. Under the leadership of the Party, with the help of Soviet experts, and with the cooperation and assistance of the production site, these experimental research institutions, through the hard work of technical personnel combined with workers, have solved many technical problems existing in production through production practice, thus playing a certain role in improving production and improving the safety and economy of operation. In addition, they have also undertaken some projects within the National Twelve-Year Science and Technology Plan, contributing a certain amount of strength to my country's great socialist construction.

    The fundamental reason for achieving these achievements in such a short period is, first and foremost, the absolute leadership of the Party.

    The Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is the lighthouse that illuminates all our work. The Party's comprehensive policy of combining advanced and general, theory and practice, current and long-term, popularization and improvement in scientific research has pointed out a specific path for the development of our scientific research work.

    Through the nationwide rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists, intellectuals have received an extremely profound class education. Through ideological remolding, the decadent bourgeois individualism and the view of fame and profit have been criticized, and in better combination with the vast number of workers, they have exerted greater power. Therefore, the leadership of the Party is the guarantee of our work's victory.

    Second, scientific research work must be closely combined with production and serve the production and construction tasks put forward by the Party in each period.

    In recent years, on the one hand, we have carried out our work according to the needs of production and construction tasks. On the other hand, we have also arranged long-term projects according to the needs of production and construction tasks. This kind of work is easy to implement and easy to carry out. It can not only make use of the favorable conditions of the production site, but also obtain support from all aspects and give play to all positive factors, thus enabling the entire scientific research work to be carried out widely. Premier Zhou's instruction in his report that "tasks directly serving production and construction should be placed in the primary position" must be resolutely implemented in our future work.

    Third, scientific research work must follow the mass line.

    The Party's call to emancipate the mind, break down superstitions, combine soaring drive with scientific analysis, and combine the research of professional scientific research institutions with the mass movement of technological revolution has changed the past situation where only a few people were engaged in scientific research in a cold and quiet manner. It has formed a mighty wave of technological revolution, making scientific research work embark on the socialist new road of the mass line, and thus we have today's vigorous atmosphere. The mass line is the fundamental line of our Party. In all specific tasks of scientific research, as in other work, we must also have a good understanding and implement it.

    Now I would like to talk about some of my experiences and opinions:

    First, how to better combine the current and long-term aspects in scientific research work.

    Scientific research work directly serves production. Therefore, it must not only solve the existing problems in current production. At the same time, we should make appropriate and necessary arrangements as soon as possible for scientific research projects put forward by national construction tasks that cannot be solved in a short period of time.

    The scale of electric power construction in my country's Second Five-Year Plan is very grand, and there will inevitably be a series of major and special problems that we need to solve ourselves. Some of the more complex ones that require a longer period of time must be started as soon as possible or prepare conditions in all aspects, otherwise it will affect the technical and economic benefits or speed of production and construction. The Party's policy of combining the current and long-term aspects is clear. How to better combine the two, that is, to see today and also see tomorrow, is a problem that deserves our great attention in the specific implementation in the future.

    Second, the issue of division of labor and cooperation in scientific research work.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, there has been a good start between units in terms of mutual support in manpower, equipment, materials, mutual communication of technical information, and mutual exchange of research results, experience, and data. However, our current human and material resources are still not commensurate with the needs of the high-speed development of my country's economic construction. How to arrange the existing human and material resources more rationally and effectively is still very important. Therefore, under the premise of continuing to promote communist cooperation, we should also conduct organized and further division of labor and cooperation for certain major projects, organically linking the forces of all parties together and giving play to collective creation, so as to obtain results quickly and effectively. In particular, the setting up of equipment with a lot of investment should be based on the spirit of the whole country as a chessboard, taking into account the overall situation and making multi-faceted use of it, with both emphasis and generality, so as to use the most economical funds and play the greatest role. This is also an important measure for increasing production and practicing economy in scientific research work.

    Third, the issue of training cadres and expanding the scientific research team.

    Although we currently have some professional research institutions, a team, and a wide range of mass scientific research activities, from the perspective of the high-speed development and growth of electric power, how to supplement a large number of cadres who are qualified to do scientific research work is still very urgent.

    Scientific research personnel should have rich production knowledge and experience, so coming from the production site is the most ideal, but the number in this regard is limited after all. The main source of cadres is still from the vast number of young people. Years of experience have shown that self-reliance and training these young people through practical training in production, learning while working, and with a sense of direction and purpose is effective. Today's young generation with socialist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm has unparalleled growth power. As long as they are given tasks and pointed out the direction, with the help of older engineers, they will grow up quickly. In the Great Leap Forward, many outstanding works were done by young technicians who learned and worked at the same time. However, in daily work, a few young people still have a tendency to underestimate the knowledge of basic subjects. Some of them believe that doing professional research work only requires professional subject knowledge, and some believe that only professionals can approach reality, or even only professionals can approach the cutting edge, and regard the knowledge of basic subjects as unimportant or not worth learning, thus making them be affected to a certain extent in their rapid improvement. These phenomena, I believe, will be resolved in future teaching.

    Fourth, the issue of material supply.

    The Party and the government have always been concerned about scientific research work. In order to solve the materials used for scientific research, they have made special decisions and organized professional supply institutions, and even in the case of relatively tight supply, they have tried to give certain consideration. However, due to the recent wide-ranging development of scientific research work in many aspects, and the fact that the characteristics of scientific research materials are that the quantity is sporadic and the types are complicated, there are sometimes some inconsistencies in the supply. In the future, some key research projects, if they can be listed together with the key projects of production and construction, and be included in the national supply plan, this will provide more favorable conditions for completing scientific research work according to the plan.

    Finally, I feel extremely angry about the armed rebellion of the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries. I resolutely support all the policies and measures of the government to quickly quell the Tibetan rebellion. Tibet is an inseparable part of our country's territory, and the Tibetan issue is our country's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. The shameful conspiracy of foreign reactionaries attempting to use the Tibetan rebellion to realize their expansionist ambitions will never succeed, and any acts by imperialism and reactionaries to undermine our country's unity will be resolutely countered. The suppression of the Tibetan rebellion has made the various nationalities of our country more united and our country's unity more consolidated. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole country will contribute greater strength to the great socialist construction of the motherland.

　　关于电力工业科学研究工作的几点意见
    徐士高代表的发言
    我热烈拥护周恩来总理，李富春、李先念副总理，彭真副委员长的报告。
    我国在共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，全国各族人民团结一致，取得了第一个五年计划的伟大胜利；通过全民整风，反右斗争，知识分子的思想改造等运动；在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线光辉照耀下，一九五八全国工农业、文化教育各个战线上出现了空前的大跃进，取得了辉煌的成就。全国人民正奋发向前，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而战斗着，这种振奋人心的灿烂景象，使人欢欣鼓舞！
    现在，我就电力工业的科学研究工作，谈几点体会与意见，请予以批评指正。
    几年来，电力工业的科学研究工作，在党的关怀和正确领导下，已得到了很大的发展。现在除了直属水利电力部有具有一定规模的研究机构外，各省（市）自治区也都建立了试验研究部门。这些试验研究机构，在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助和生产现场的配合协助下，由于技术人员与工人相结合的辛勤劳动，通过生产实践，解决了不少生产上存在的技术问题，因而对改善生产，提高运行的安全性、经济性起到了一定的作用。除此以外，还分别承担了国家十二年科研规划内部分项目，为我国伟大的社会主义建设贡献一定的力量。
    在这短短几年内，取得这些成就，根本原因，首先是党的绝对领导。
    党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是照耀我们一切工作的灯塔。科学研究工作中，党提出的尖端与一般、理论与实际、目前与长远、普及与提高相结合一整套两条腿走路的方针，更为我们科学研究工作的发展指出了具体道路。
    通过全民整风、反右斗争，使知识分子受到了一次极为深刻的阶级教育；通过思想改造，批判了腐朽的资产阶级个人主义思想和名利观点，在和广大工人同志更好的结合中，发挥了更大的力量。因此，党的领导，是我们工作获得胜利的保证。
    第二、科学研究工作必须紧密结合生产，为在每一时期党所提出的生产建设任务而服务。
    几年来，我们一方面根据生产需要与建设任务进行工作。另一方面也根据生产需要与建设任务安排长远的课题。这样工作易于落实，便于开展，既可利用生产现场有利条件，又可获得各方面的支持，发挥一切积极因素，因而使整个科学研究工作得到了广阔的开展。周总理报告中所提出的、“直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要地位”的指示，必须是我们今后工作中，坚决贯彻执行的。
    第三、科学研究工作必须走群众路线。
    党提出的解放思想、破除迷信，冲天的干劲和科学分析相结合，专业科研机构的研究和技术革命的群众运动相结合，改变了过去仅由少数人冷冷清清搞科学研究工作的局面。形成了声势浩大的技术革命的浪潮，使得科学研究工作走上了群众路线的社会主义新道路，因而就有了今天这种蓬勃的气象。群众路线是我们党的根本路线，在科学研究的各项具体工作中，也与其他工作一样，还必须很好的体会，加以贯彻。
    下面谈几点体会与意见：
    第一、关于科学研究工作中目前与长远如何结合得更好的问题。
    科学研究工作，是直接为生产服务的。因之，它不但要解决目前生产上存在的问题。同时，对国家建设任务所提出的，不是短期间内能解决的科学研究课题也应及早地进行适当的和必要的安排。
    我国第二个五年计划内电力建设的规模是十分宏伟的，必然会有一系列重大的、特殊的问题，需要我们自己解决。其中某些复杂的、需要时间较长的，更必须及早着手或从各方面准备条件，否则将会影响生产建设的技术经济效益或速度。党的目前与长远相结合的方针是明确的，如何能把两者结合得更好，即既看到今天，又看到明天，是今后我们在具体的贯彻执行中值得十分重视的问题。
    第二、关于科研工作中分工协作的问题。
    一九五八年大跃进以来，各单位之间，在互相支援人力、设备、器材，互通技术情报，互相交流研究成果、经验和资料等方面已有了良好的开端。但是，我们今天的人力物力与我国经济建设高速度发展的需要，还是不相适应的。如何更合理、更有效的安排现有的人力物力仍然是十分重要的，因而在继续发扬共产主义大协作的前提下，对某些重大课题，还应有组织的、更进一步的进行分工协作，有机的把各方面的力量网联在一起，发挥集体创作，以便迅速而有效的得出成果。特别是对于投资多的设备的设置，更应本着全国一盘棋的精神，统筹兼顾，多面利用，既有重点，又有一般，俾能用最省的资金，发挥最大的作用，这也是科学研究工作增产节约的一项重要措施。
    第三、关于培养干部、壮大科研队伍的问题。
    我们目前虽有了一些专业的研究机构，有了一支队伍及广大群众的科研活动，但从电力的高速发展与增长来说，如何补充大量的、合乎做科研工作的干部，还是十分急迫的。
    做科学研究工作的人员，应具备丰富的生产知识和经验，所以来自生产现场是最理想的，但这方面的数量毕竟是有限的。主要的干部来源，还是来自广大的青年一辈。几年来的经验，说明了自力更生，把这些青年人通过生产实践的锻炼，在工作中边作边学，有方向有目的的培养是行之有效的。具有社会主义觉悟与革命热情的今天的青年一辈，是有着无比的生长力的，只要放手给他们任务，指出方向，在年老的工程师的帮助下，他们是会很快成长起来的。在大跃进中有好多出色的工作，就是青年技术员边学边作而做出来的。但在日常工作中，少数的青年还有轻视基础学科知识的偏向，他们有的认为作专业研究工作只要有专业学科知识就成了，也有的认为只有专业可以接近实际，或甚而只有专业可以接近尖端，把基础学科的知识看成是无关重要或不屑去学的，因而使他们在迅速的提高上受到了一定的影响。这些现象，相信在今后的教学中，会得到解决的。
    第四、关于器材供应的问题。
    党和政府一直是关怀科研工作的，为解决科研所用器材，曾作了专门的决定，组织了专业的供应机构，即使在供应较为紧张的情况下，也设法给予一定的照顾。但由于近来科学研究工作多方面的广阔开展，加以科学研究需要器材的特点是数量零星、种类繁杂，因而供应上有时还有一些不相适应的现象。今后有些重点的研究课题，如果能与生产基建的重点项目一并排队，一并列入国家供应计划，这对按计划的完成科学研究工作，将提供更多的有利条件。
    最后，我对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，进行武装叛乱，感到极大的愤怒，坚决拥护政府迅速平定西藏叛乱的一切政策和措施。西藏是我国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏问题是我国的内政，决不容许任何人进行干涉。外国反动派企图利用西藏叛乱事件实现扩张野心的可耻阴谋永远不能得逞，任何帝国主义和反动分子破坏我国统一的行为将遭到坚决回击。西藏叛乱的平定，使我国各民族更加团结，使我国的统一更加巩固。全国人民在中国共产党的领导下，为祖国伟大的社会主义建设，贡献出更大的力量。
