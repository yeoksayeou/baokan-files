    Strengthen Early Rice Field Management

    Last winter and this spring, the southern provinces attached great importance to early rice production. In many places, the measures to increase early rice production were fully discussed by the masses and were practical and feasible. This year, the general plowing depth of early rice fields is about six inches, an increase of one to three inches compared with previous years. The base fertilizer has also increased by about 30% compared with previous years. The planting density has increased by one-third to one-half compared to last year. These tremendous efforts have created extremely favorable conditions for a bumper harvest of early rice this year. On this basis, if we closely follow up with field management, linking each step tightly and leaving nothing unattended, then there is great hope for achieving an even greater bumper harvest of early rice.

    From transplanting to ripening and harvesting, early rice takes approximately eighty days. During this period, the word "management" is indispensable at all times. Whether or not we can achieve a greater bumper harvest of early rice this year mainly depends on how well we manage it in the future. Because early rice, like other grain crops, has its yield per mu determined by the total number of ears per mu, the number of grains per ear, and the weight of each grain. The efforts made in the past in terms of soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, and density have laid the foundation for high early rice yields; and what determines the number of ears, the number of grains, and the weight of the grains is the field management from now on.

    This year, after the planting density of early rice has been increased, a series of new problems will inevitably arise during the growth process, requiring vigorous strengthening of field management work to solve them one by one. Problems that can already be anticipated are that, after dense planting, rows will close earlier, and weeding time will also need to be advanced. After more fertilizer and denser planting, seedlings are more prone to lodging, which requires rational fertilization, rational irrigation, and drainage. In some areas, there are more weeds in direct-seeded fields, which requires more labor to remove the weeds, and so on.

    At present, early rice in the Yangtze River basin has largely entered the tillering stage. Strengthening the management work in this stage can strive to increase effective tillering. With more effective tillers, the number of plants and ears will also increase. This year, the planting density of early rice has increased, and tillering has been somewhat suppressed. However, the density varies from place to place. Therefore, efforts should be made to ensure that the main ears are strong and that early effective tillering increases. To strive for more plants and more ears, more nutrients need to be supplied. In addition to applying base fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, it is necessary to apply fast-acting topdressing fertilizers early and carry out mid-cultivation and weeding as early as possible. Fast-acting topdressing fertilizers have a rapid effect. Applied to the soil surface, they can enable seedlings to immediately obtain the nutrients urgently needed for growth and development. Mid-cultivation can loosen the soil and promote the decomposition of fertilizers. Especially in cases where there is more organic fertilizer, mid-cultivation cannot be ignored. Weeding can prevent weeds from competing with early rice for nutrients, which is beneficial to the growth of seedlings. To meet the needs of early rice growth during this period, shallow water irrigation should also be implemented. Shallow water irrigation can increase the ground temperature during the day and reduce the ground temperature at night, increasing the diurnal temperature difference, increasing photosynthesis, reducing respiration, and helping to accumulate nutrients.

    After the tillering and jointing stage, the base of the seedling stems gradually changes from flat to round, which marks the entry of early rice into the jointing and booting stage. The booting stage of early rice generally lasts for more than twenty days. The size of the ears and the number of grains after heading mainly depend on how well they are cultivated during this stage. If the nutrient supply is sufficient and timely, the ears will be large and have many grains. If the nutrition is poor, it will affect the differentiation of young ears and reduce the number of spikelets, resulting in small ears and few grains; and it will also cause partial death of tillers that have already formed in the early stage. Therefore, appropriately applying fast-acting nitrogen and potassium fertilizers at the beginning of young ear differentiation is an economical and effective measure to increase early rice yield. Especially in the case of dense planting of early rice this year, the seedlings need more nutrients, and in some areas the base fertilizer is insufficient, and early topdressing is impossible, so it is necessary to seize the opportunity to apply ear fertilizer at the beginning of booting, in order to achieve the effect of increasing production. During the booting period, the seedlings grow most vigorously, the ear embryos gradually increase, and the stems rapidly elongate, requiring not only a large amount of nutrients, but also sufficient moisture. To meet this need, the irrigation water level can be appropriately deepened. In addition, while ensuring the water supply, preparations should also be made for drought and flood prevention.

    In order to apply more fertilizer, attention must be paid to solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer. Although many areas have accumulated a lot of fertilizer in the early stage, the fertilizer is still insufficient because more fertilizer is needed after dense planting. How to solve this problem? The experience of areas south of the Nanling Mountains is worthy of attention. After the early rice transplanting was basically completed, various parts of Guangdong Province quickly launched a field management campaign centered on fertilizer and scientific fertilization, implementing simultaneous transplanting and management, early management and full management, fine management and careful management, to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice. In order to quickly get the fertilizer needed for early rice and quickly apply it to the fields, the Shantou Special District established fertilizer command organizations in various counties and communes, with the first secretary of the Party committee personally taking charge, and generally concentrated 50% to 60% of the agricultural labor force to participate in quick accumulation, rapid production, and rapid application. Zhongshan County in the Pearl River Delta adopted thirteen methods such as picking, shoveling, scooping, sweeping, picking up, burning, fumigating, dismantling, digging, collecting, bailing, making, and soaking to solve the fertilizer problem. This proves that as long as the masses are widely mobilized and their enthusiasm is fully utilized, the problem of insufficient fertilizer can definitely be solved.

    In addition, it is necessary to do a good job in pest and disease prevention in order to ensure a greater bumper harvest of early rice. Recently, major pests and diseases that harm early rice, such as rice borers, leaf rollers, rice planthoppers, leafhoppers, and rice blast, have successively occurred in some areas of South China and along the Yangtze River, which should arouse vigilance. All localities should, based on the principles of treating early, treating small, and treating thoroughly, organize the masses in a timely manner to completely eliminate them and protect the growth of early rice.

    Due to the different seasons of early rice growth and the different planting times in various places, the main direction of attack in field management should also be different at present. In various parts of the Yangtze River basin, areas with earlier planting should prepare for breaking through the grain number barrier, and areas with later planting should focus on the number of ears. In most areas south of the Nanling Mountains, early rice has already jointed and is booting, so late-stage management should be strengthened to achieve the goal of large ears, many grains, and plump grains. From now until the early rice matures, field management work must be carried out from beginning to end, grasping the current main target. Strive to manage early, manage carefully, manage comprehensively, and manage thoroughly. To this end, on the one hand, the rich experience created in the Great Leap Forward last year must be seriously summarized and studied, and widely applied to this year's early rice field management; at the same time, when applying these experiences, we must resolutely implement the mass line working method and the principle of adapting to local conditions and times. Vigorously launch bumper harvest competitions, carry out evaluation and inspection, achieve on-site consultation, watch the crops and promote growth, and prescribe the right medicine. Closely combine the enthusiasm of the masses with technical measures, the more enthusiasm is encouraged, the more detailed the measures are, and the higher the early rice bumper harvest red flag is raised.

    加强早稻田间管理
    去冬今春，南方各省对早稻生产非常重视，不少地方的早稻增产措施，经过群众充分讨论，作到了切实可行。今年早稻田一般耕深六寸左右，比往年加深了一至三寸。基肥也比往年增加30％左右。栽插密度比去年增加三分之一到二分之一。这些巨大努力为今年早稻大丰收创造了极为有利的条件。在这个基础上，再把田间管理工作紧紧跟上，环环扣紧，着着不让；那末，争取早稻更大丰收就大有希望。
    早稻从插秧到成熟收获，大致有八十天左右的时间，在这个期间，一时一刻也离不开“管”字。今年早稻能不能获得更大丰收，主要就看今后管得如何。因为早稻和其他禾谷类作物一样，每亩产量是由每亩总穗数、每穗粒数和每粒重量决定的。过去在土、肥、水、种、密方面所做的努力，为早稻高产打下了基础；而决定穗数、粒数和谷粒重量的，则是今后的田间管理。
    今年早稻栽插密度加大以后，生长过程中必然要出现一系列的新的问题，需要大力加强田间管理工作来一一加以解决。已经可以估计到的问题是，密植以后封行提早，耘田时间也就需要提早。肥多密植以后，禾苗容易倒伏，这就需要合理施肥、合理灌溉和排水。部分地区直播田里的杂草比较多，就要用较多的劳力去除草，等等。
    目前长江流域早稻大部进入了分蘖阶段，加强这个阶段的管理工作，就可以争取增加有效分蘖；有效分蘖增多，株数和穗数也就增多。今年早稻栽插密度加大，分蘖受到了一定的抑制。但是各地的密度是不同的，因此，应当努力争取主穗健壮，早期有效分蘖增多。要争取株多穗多，就需要供应较多的养分。除了施用含有氮、磷、钾的基肥外，必须早施速效性追肥和及早进行中耕除草。速效性追肥肥效快，施于土壤表层，能使禾苗立即得到生长发育所急需的养分。中耕可以疏松土壤，促进肥料的分解。特别在有机质肥料较多的情况下，中耕更不能忽视。除草能够制止杂草与早稻争夺养分，有利禾苗的生长。为适应这一时期早稻生长的需要，还应当实行浅水灌溉。实行浅水灌溉可使稻田白天的地温提高，晚间的地温减低，加大了昼夜温差，增加光合作用，减少呼吸作用，有助于养分的积累。
    过了分蘖和拔节期，禾苗茎秆基部逐渐由扁变圆，这就标志早稻进入拔节孕穗期。早稻孕穗期一般有二十多天的时间。抽穗后穗子的大小，粒数的多少，主要决定于这个阶段培育的好坏。如果养分供应充足及时，就能穗大、粒多。如果营养不好，就要影响幼穗的分化，减少小穗数目，造成穗小粒少的结果；而且还会使前期已经形成的分蘖发生局部死亡。因此，在幼穗开始分化时适当地施用速效性的氮肥和钾肥，是提高早稻产量经济而有效的措施。特别是在今年早稻密植的情况下，禾苗需要养分多，而有些地区基肥不足，早期追肥又不可能多，在孕穗初期就应该抓紧追施穗肥，这才能达到增产效果。孕穗期间，禾苗生长最为旺盛，穗胎逐渐增大，茎秆急速伸长，不仅需要多量的养分，并且需要足够的水分。为满足这种需要，可适当加深灌溉水层。此外，在保证水分供应的同时，还要做好防旱防涝的准备。
    为了多施肥料，就必须注意解决肥料不足的问题。不少地区前期积肥虽然不少，但因密植以后需要更多的肥料，所以肥料仍然不足。怎样解决这个问题呢？五岭以南地区的经验是值得注意的。广东省各地在早稻插秧基本结束后，就迅速开展了一个以肥料挂帅、以科学用肥为中心的田间管理运动，实行边插边管，早管全管，精管细管，以保证早稻大丰收。汕头专区为了很快把早稻需要的肥料搞到手，并且迅速地施到田里，各县、各公社都成立肥料指挥机构，党委第一书记亲自挂帅，普遍集中了50％到60％的农业劳动力投入到快积、猛制、速施的行动中。珠江三角洲上的中山县采取了采、铲、捞、扫、拾、烧、熏、拆、挖、收、戽、制、沤等十三种办法，解决了肥料问题。由此证明，只要广泛动员群众，充分发挥群众的干劲，肥料不足的问题，是一定能够解决的。
    此外，还要做好防虫防病工作，才能保证早稻更大丰收。近来，为害早稻的主要病虫害如螟虫、纵卷叶虫、稻飞虱、浮尘子和稻瘟病等已经在华南和长江沿岸的部分地区相继发生，这是应该引起警惕的。各地应该根据治早、治小、治了的原则，及时组织群众，彻底地加以消灭，保护早稻生长。
    由于各地早稻生长的季节和栽插时期的不同，当前在田间管理的主攻方向上也应当有所不同。长江流域各地，栽插较早的地区应该为攻破粒数关做好准备，在栽插较晚的地区应该把主攻方向放在穗数方面。南岭以南大部地区早稻已经拔节孕穗，应当加强后期管理，达到穗大、粒多、粒饱的目的。从目前到早稻成熟这个期间内，必须把田间管理工作自始至终地贯彻到底，抓紧当前的主攻目标。作到管得早，管得细，管得全面，管得彻底。为此，一方面要把去年大跃进中所创造的丰富经验认真的总结研究，广泛运用到今年早稻田间管理上来；同时在运用这些经验的时候，要坚决贯彻群众路线的工作方法和因时因地制宜的原则。大搞丰产竞赛，开展评比检查，做到临田会商，看禾促进，对症下药。把群众干劲与技术措施紧密结合起来，干劲越鼓越足，措施越抓越细，早稻丰产红旗越插越高。
