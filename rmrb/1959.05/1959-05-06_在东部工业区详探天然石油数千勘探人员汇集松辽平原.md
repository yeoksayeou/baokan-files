Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 5th: Petroleum exploration is vigorously underway on the Songliao Plain. Several thousand exploration personnel from three units—the Northeast Geophysical Exploration Team of the Ministry of Geology, the Songliao Petroleum Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Petroleum, and the Songliao Petroleum Prospecting Team of the Jilin Provincial Bureau of Geology—are undertaking exploration tasks here. After three years of investigation, the Songliao Plain has been identified as a promising oil-bearing area. To rapidly change the distribution of China's petroleum industry and to find oil as quickly as possible in China's eastern region, which is industrially developed, has convenient transportation, and especially has a large oil consumption, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Ministry of Geology have decided to make the Songliao Plain the focus of this year's petroleum prospecting and exploration work. This year, the region will both comprehensively conduct prospecting using a "large net" approach to discover more potential oil-bearing structures, and concentrate efforts on key breakthroughs, carrying out detailed investigation and exploration in the most promising oil-bearing structures, striving to determine the oil-bearing value of the Songliao Plain in the shortest possible time.

Under the assistance of Soviet experts, the overall design for exploring the Songliao Plain has been compiled. In the process of compiling the overall design, the opinions of Hungarian experts on geophysical exploration were also incorporated. According to the overall design plan, efforts will be made to find oil sources in the shortest possible time and determine their industrial value.

Currently, the petroleum exploration forces and scientific researchers who once fought in Xinjiang, as well as some faculty and students from the Beijing Petroleum Science Research Institute and the Petroleum Institute, are arriving one after another; large quantities of drilling equipment are being transported to the construction site by air and land.

　　在东部工业区详探天然石油数千勘探人员汇集松辽平原
    新华社长春5日电　松辽平原石油勘探工作正在大力进行。在这里担负勘探任务的，有地质部东北石油物探大队、石油部松辽石油勘探局、吉林省地质局松辽石油普查大队等三个单位的数千名勘探人员。松辽平原经过三年的勘查，已被确定是一个大有希望的含油地区。为了迅速改变我国石油工业的分布状况，尽快地在工业发达、交通便利、特别是耗油量较大的我国东部地区找出石油，石油工业部和地质部已经决定把松辽平原作为今年我国石油普查探勘工作的重点。今年在这个地区，一方面将采取“撒大网”的方法，全面开展普查，以发现更多的可能储油构造；一方面要集中力量，重点突破，在最有希望的储油构造上展开详查和勘探，力争在最短时间内探明松辽平原的含油价值。
    在苏联专家的帮助下，勘查松辽平原的总体设计已经编制出来了。在编制总体设计过程中，还吸取了匈牙利专家对地球物理勘探方面的意见。根据总体设计规划，将力争在最短时间内找出油源，并确定它的工业价值。
    现在，曾经战斗在新疆的石油勘探大军和科学研究人员，以及北京石油科学研究院、石油学院的部分师生，正在陆续到来；大批的钻探设备已从空中、地上源源运进工地。
