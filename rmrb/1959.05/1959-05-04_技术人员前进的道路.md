Committee member Sun Ding said: Only by combining labor and technology and tempering themselves among the working masses, gradually transforming their positions, viewpoints, thoughts, and methods, can technical personnel play their due role in socialist construction and achieve new technological advancements.

    I fully endorse the instructions and reports of the leaders at this conference and guarantee to resolutely implement the various policies and spirits instructed by the leaders in my work. 1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in China's industry and agriculture. Here, I would like to talk about my personal experiences regarding the impact of the Great Leap Forward of 1958 on the socialist transformation of bourgeois technical personnel. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 not only brought infinite and beautiful prospects to our country but also had a tremendous and profound impact worldwide. The great significance of the Great Leap Forward of 1958 is not only reflected in the magnificent achievements of industry and agriculture, but more importantly, the unparalleled correctness of the Party's general line for building socialism. Through the glorious achievements of 1958, it has been more deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of the whole country, making the people of the whole country more closely united around the Party, and advancing by leaps and bounds along the correct line put forward by the Party with full confidence. Therefore, 1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward and a year of greater unity of the people of the whole country under the banner of socialism. The closer we get to the broad masses, the more we feel that everything is filled with confidence and determination. The more we come into contact with grassroots work, the more we see that everything is full of wisdom and creativity. In short, behind the magnificent figures of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, there is boundless wisdom and immense power of the broad masses. This wisdom and power is a huge furnace for the transformation of bourgeois technical personnel; only by resolutely throwing ourselves into this huge furnace to temper ourselves can we accelerate our self-transformation in the Great Leap Forward and not be abandoned by the great era.
    After the rectification campaign, I began to participate in labor. Last year, I also participated in the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's 10,000-person inspection team, and this year I also participated in the CPPCC's inspection work in the heavy industry sector. Through more than a year of going deep into the grassroots, witnessing firsthand, and experiencing personally, I have deeply realized that to strengthen the self-transformation of bourgeois technical personnel, we must first implement the combination of labor and technology in our work. The combination of labor and technology proposed by the Party points out a broad road to socialism for the self-transformation of technical personnel. Through the combination of labor and technology, not only can technology be combined with practice to better play its role, but more importantly, it can be invested into the working masses, integrated with the workers, and gradually feel the position, viewpoints, thoughts, and methods of the working class through practice, thereby strengthening self-transformation. However, in the past, my understanding of the great significance of the combination of labor and technology proposed by the Party was insufficient. Due to the blind belief in books, foreigners, and oneself, individualistic thoughts tightly bound oneself in a small circle, like sitting in a well and looking at the sky, unable to see the profound impact and great significance of the power of the broad masses on the development of science and technology and socialist construction; and even less aware that closely combining labor and technology with our service is an important key for our technical personnel to accept socialist transformation. The heroic spirit of the working class to dare to think and act, and the pragmatic work style, are precisely the indispensable work attitude of a person engaged in scientific and technological work, and this work attitude is precisely difficult to find in our bourgeois scientific and technological personnel. Due to two different positions, two completely different work attitudes are reflected. One is daring to think and do, and the other is worrying about gains and losses; one is full of energy, and the other is sometimes cold and sometimes hot. It is absolutely impossible for us bourgeois technical personnel to achieve anything in the field of science and technology or contribute to socialist construction with this attitude of worrying about gains and losses and being sometimes cold and sometimes hot. In the past, I separated position from scientific and technological work, thinking that the two were irrelevant. Through the Great Leap Forward last year, I deeply realized that this was completely wrong. Only by combining labor and technology, training ourselves among the working masses, and gradually transforming our positions, viewpoints, thoughts, and methods, can our technology play its due role in socialist construction and be further improved technologically.
    What moved me the most during this inspection was the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory. This factory has small and dilapidated buildings, outdated machinery, and no technical personnel except for veteran workers and young workers. However, they used the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to complete the mechanical equipment of a ten-ton converter for the country in eighteen days, and they will also complete two sets of 630mm huge rolling mills for the country in four months. Due to the soaring enthusiasm of all the workers, they not only created countless indigenous equipment, but also revived old machine parts that had been sleeping in mud pits and ignored, and old lathes that were eighty years old, to play a huge role in socialist construction. They said heroically: Although our factory is small and the machines are old, we can operate in the open air by using "the sky as the factory building"; and process on the spot by using "the ground as the lathe." Their heroic spirit and creative spirit deeply moved me and also gave me great encouragement. What they thought was exactly what our technical personnel did not dare to think, and what they did was exactly what our technical personnel did not dare to do. Doesn't this fully illustrate that when science and technology are separated from labor practice, they lose their vitality and inevitably become lifeless. The "ants gnawing at bones" indigenous method used by the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory is essentially opening up a new path of technological operation, is a revolution in technological operation, and has a promising future. Their work spirit is to implement the Party's guidance to create conditions and build our socialism on the basis of self-reliance. Through more than a year of going deep into the grassroots, participating in labor, and recent inspection work, not only has my thinking been further improved, but I have also been greatly inspired technically. I am engaged in the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, and for many years, the backwardness of production equipment in the local electrical machinery manufacturing industry has made me feel depressed. Especially after the Party pointed out this year that improving labor productivity is the key to building socialism and improving living standards, the burden on my mind has become even heavier. Without new equipment to change the backward production situation, how can we improve labor productivity? After visiting the Construction Machinery Factory, I was inspired and strengthened my confidence. After joint research with the working masses and technical personnel, we gradually explored a path of technological revolution, a path of less investment, greater results, and self-reliance. We implement the work spirit of the Construction Factory into our production. We divide the process into parts, and design various special-purpose indigenous equipment according to the different requirements of the process to replace complex machines; then connect these special-purpose indigenous equipment in sequence according to the process of our product processing to form a semi-automatic assembly line, to take the first step for gradually converting to a fully automatic assembly line in the future. Through such a method, we are confident to respond to the Party's call to change the current backward production situation and greatly improve labor productivity through self-reliance. Although our work is arduous, with the leadership of the Party and the wisdom and enthusiasm of the workers, we have no insurmountable difficulties.
    Premier Zhou's report pointed out a bright road for our technical personnel. Premier Zhou kindly instructed us to first stand on the side of socialism and be with the broad masses of people, and then we can use the knowledge and technology we have mastered to give full play to our expertise and be welcomed by the people. I will definitely resolutely implement Premier Zhou's instructions to strengthen transformation and actively serve in the future. Our knowledge is insignificant, and only by closely combining it with the practice of workers can it play a role and be further improved. The electrical machinery manufacturing industry is an important task in this year's construction, and how to improve product design to save raw materials and improve technological operations to improve labor productivity will be our central tasks in the future. As long as we firmly rely on the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of workers, we are confident to complete this glorious task assigned to us by the Party together with the broad masses of workers.
    Comrades, when our socialist construction is constantly achieving brilliant victories, imperialism and all reactionaries will inevitably not be reconciled and conspire to sabotage. Because the victory of our socialist construction and their dark and cruel bloody rule are incompatible. Recently, a small handful of traitorous elements in the upper strata of Tibet colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and certain expansionist elements in India, in order to dream of permanently maintaining their enslavement system of exploiting the broad masses of Tibetan people, and openly launched an armed rebellion in an attempt to undermine the unity of the motherland's territory and the unity of all ethnic groups. This frantic move of theirs is precisely their death throes, accelerating their own destruction. I resolutely support the government's measures to quell the rebellion and dissolve the original Tibetan local government, and the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee exercises local functions and powers, so that Tibet can quickly realize ethnic regional autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reforms. Because this is in line with the greatest interests of the broad masses of Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. Let us people of all ethnic groups in the country unite closely under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and strive to build a more prosperous and happier socialist society.
    I wish all members good health.

    技术人员前进的道路
    孙鼎委员说：技术人员只有通过劳技结合，在工人群众中锻炼自己，逐步改造自己的立场、观点、思想和方法，才有可能为社会主义建设发挥应有的作用，在技术上取得新的成就
    我完全拥护这次大会上各位首长的指示和报告，并保证在我的工作岗位上坚决贯彻各位首长所指示的各项政策和精神。一九五八年是我国工农业大跃进的一年，这里我想就一九五八年大跃进对资产阶级技术人员社会主义改造的影响，来谈谈我个人的体会。一九五八年大跃进不仅给我们国家带来无限美好的远景，而且在全世界范围内也起了巨大的深刻影响。一九五八年大跃进的重大意义不仅反映在工农业的宏伟成就上，更重要的是党所提出的建设社会主义总路线无比的正确性，通过一九五八年的辉煌成就，更深刻地印入了全国人民的内心深处，使全国人民更加紧密地团结在党的周围，满怀信心地沿着党所提出的正确路线大踏步地前进。因而，一九五八年是大跃进的一年，也是全国人民在社会主义的旗帜下更大的团结的一年。当我们和广大群众愈接近的时候，我们就愈感觉到处处都充满着信心和决心。当我们愈接触到基层工作的时候，我们就愈看到处处都充满着智慧和创造。总之，在一九五八年工农业大跃进宏伟的数字的后面，是充满了广大群众无比的智慧和巨大的力量。这些智慧和力量，对资产阶级技术人员的改造来说，是一座巨大的熔炉；我们只有坚决地投入到这座巨大的熔炉中来锻炼自己，我们才有可能在大跃进中来加速自我改造，而不为大时代所抛弃。
    整风之后，我开始参加劳动。去年我又参加了上海市委万人检查团，今年我也参加了政协在重工业方面的视察工作。经过一年多来深入基层的亲眼所见，和亲身所历，使我深刻地认识到资产阶级技术人员的加强自我改造，首先必须在工作中贯彻劳技结合。党所提出的劳技结合是给技术人员自我改造指出了一条通向社会主义的康庄大道。通过劳技结合，不仅使技术结合实践，更好地发挥作用，更重要的是能投入到工人群众中去，和工人打成一片，通过实践来逐步地感受工人阶级的立场、观点、思想和方法，从而来加强改造自己。可是我过去对党所提出的劳技结合的重大意义是认识不足的。由于迷信书本，迷信洋人，迷信自己等个人主义思想把自己紧紧地束缚在一个小圈子里，坐井观天，就看不清广大群众的力量对科学事业的发展，和社会主义建设所起的深刻影响和重大意义；更认识不到把劳技结合和我们的服务密切地结合起来，是我们技术人员接受社会主义改造的重要关键。工人阶级敢想敢做的豪迈气概，和实事求是的工作作风，正是一个从事科技工作者不可缺少的工作态度，而这种工作态度恰恰在我们资产阶级科技人员的身上是很难找到的了。由于两种不同的立场，反映出两种截然不同的工作态度。一个是敢想敢做，一个是患得患失；一个是干劲冲天，一个是时冷时热。我们资产阶级技术人员抱着这种患得患失和时冷时热的态度，要想在科技事业上有所成就，社会主义建设上有所贡献，那是绝不可能的。过去我把立场和科技工作分割开，认为两者是无关的。通过去年大跃进，使我深深地领会到这是完全错误的。我们技术人员只有通过劳技结合，在工人群众中来锻炼自己，来逐步地改造自己的立场、观点、思想和方法，然后我们的技术才有可能为社会主义建设发挥应有的作用，和在技术上进一步得到提高。
    在这次视察中，最使我感动的是上海建设机器厂。这个厂是厂房破小，机器陈旧，除了老年工人和青工而外并无一个技术人员。可是他们用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，为国家在十八天内完成了十吨转炉的机械设备，又将要在四个月内，为国家完成两套六百三十公厘巨大的轧钢机。由于全体工人的干劲冲天，不仅创造了无数的土设备，而且还使沉睡在泥坑中无人过问的旧机器零件，和八十年超龄的旧车床也振作起来，为社会主义建设发挥了巨大作用。他们豪迈地说：我们厂虽小，机器虽旧，但是我们可以把“天当厂房”来露天操作；把“地当车床”来就地加工。他们的英雄气概和创造精神，使我深深地受到感动，同时也给了我巨大的鼓舞。他们所想的正是我们技术人员所不敢想的，他们所做的，也正是我们技术人员所不敢做的。这难道还不充分说明，当科学技术脱离了劳动实践就失去了它的生命力，而必然变为死气沉沉。上海建设机器厂所用的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的土办法，实质上是开辟了一条新的工艺操作道路，是工艺操作的革命，是有远大前途的。他们的工作精神是贯彻了党所指出的要在自力更生的基础上，创造条件，来建设我们的社会主义。通过一年多来的深入基层，参加劳动，和最近的视察工作，不仅在我的思想上进一步地得到提高，而且在技术上也得到很大的启发。我是搞电机制造工业的，多年来由于地方电机制造业在生产设备上的落后面貌使我感到苦闷。尤其是今年党又指出提高劳动生产率是建设社会主义提高生活水平的关键这一指示后，我思想上的负担更加沉重了。没有新的设备来改变落后的生产面貌，如何能提高劳动生产率呢？参观了建设机器厂后，使我得到了启发，加强了信心，再通过和工人群众技术人员的共同研究后，我们逐渐地摸索出一条技术革命的道路，一条投资少、收效大、自力更生的道路。我们把建设厂的工作精神贯彻到我们的生产上去。我们把工艺化整为零，按工艺的不同要求，来自己设计各种用专用性的土设备来代替复杂的机器；再把这些专用土设备按我们产品加工的工艺的程序联贯成线来组成一条半自动的流水加工线，为将来逐步转为全自动流水加工线先做好第一步。通过这样一个办法，我们是有信心响应党的号召自力更生地来改变目前生产上的落后面貌，来大大提高劳动生产率。虽然我们的工作是艰巨的，但有党的领导和工人的智慧和干劲，我们是没有不可克服的困难的。
    周总理的报告中给我们技术人员指出一条光明大道，周总理亲切地指示我们要首先站在社会主义这一方面来，同广大人民在一起，然后才有可能运用我们所掌握的知识和技术，发挥我们的专长，而受到人民的欢迎。我今后一定坚决贯彻周总理的指示来加强改造，积极服务。我们的知识是渺小的，只有把它和工人的实践密切地结合起来才有可能发挥作用，和进一步地提高。电机制造工业是今年建设任务中的一项重要工作，今后如何改进产品设计来节约原材料，和改进工艺操作来提高劳动生产率，将是我们的中心任务。只要我们坚决依靠广大工人群众的智慧和力量，我们是有信心和广大工人群众一起来完成党所交给我们这个光荣任务的。
    各位委员，当我们社会主义建设不断地取得辉煌胜利的时候，帝国主义和一切反动派必然不会甘心而阴谋破坏。因为我们社会主义建设的胜利和他们的黑暗、残酷的血腥统治是水火不能相容的。最近西藏上层一小撮叛国分子勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和印度某些扩张主义分子，为了梦想永久维持他们压榨广大西藏人民的奴役制度，公然武装叛乱，企图破坏祖国领土的统一和各民族的团结。他们这种丧心病狂的举动，正是他们垂死的挣扎，加速了他们自己的毁灭。我坚决拥护政府平息叛乱的措施和解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方职权，使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革这一英明措施。因为这是符合西藏广大人民也是全国人民最大的利益的。让我们全国各族人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，密坚地团结起来，为建设更繁荣，更幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗吧。
    祝各位委员身体健康。
