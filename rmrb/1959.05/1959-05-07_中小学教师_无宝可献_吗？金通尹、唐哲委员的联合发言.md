　　Can Middle and Primary School Teachers Offer Nothing of Value?
　　Joint Speech by Deputies Jin Tongyin and Tang Zhe
    We have listened to Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 state final accounts and the 1959 state budget draft, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We fully agree with them and are determined to implement them resolutely. We are very excited about the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist construction and the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward that is being prepared this year on the basis of the great victory of the national people's great leap forward last year. Such a grand and magnificent plan can be fully realized through the active efforts of the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    In order to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Fuchun said: "We believe that among the various organizational measures that must be taken at present, the most important link is to immediately launch a mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution on all fronts of the national economy." Yes, such a movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is the most important link of the moment. Increasing production and practicing economy is the basic method for developing the socialist economy and expanding socialist accumulation. It is the glorious tradition of the Chinese Communist Party. It is the effective and valuable experience that the Chinese Communist Party has used over the past 30 years in the practice of revolution and construction to mobilize the masses, overcome difficulties, and move from victory to victory. It is our country's long-term policy for building socialism and communism. The central link of the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, which is now being carried out vigorously throughout the country, is to vigorously carry out technological revolution, vigorously engage in technological innovation, improve production efficiency, and improve production quality. In the process of implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, a new upsurge will be set off.

    Since the beginning of this year, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province has issued many instructions, calling on the people of the city to actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological revolution, and demanding that in this movement, everyone contribute their wisdom, everyone contribute their strength, and actively do a good job in making "double contributions." The people of the city warmly responded to this call. Under the leadership of the Party, the various democratic parties and people's organizations also promoted all members within their own organizations to take active action. Among the vast numbers of workers, peasants, laborers, and intellectuals, many people in various work positions have already made "double contribution" plans, preparing to offer gifts to the Party during festivals such as "May 1st," "July 1st," and the "10th Anniversary of National Day." Creative inventions are heard of every day.

    Most of the members of the "China Democratic League" and the "China Association for Promoting Democracy" in our Wuhan City are middle and primary school teachers. When the call for the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation was first put forward, some people thought this way: Workers, peasants, and the masses and technical personnel use tools every day and are constantly exposed to technical problems, so they are skilled and easily have creative inventions; university professors and experts from scientific research institutions have both profound theoretical knowledge and rich practical experience, and their cultivation is of a high standard. Lengthy monographs of millions of words, or a special paper on cutting-edge science, can be offered after some hard work and dedication, which is of great value to the national economy and people's livelihood. But what about middle and primary school teachers? They only deal with a group of children day and night, either engaged in Chinese, history, or lecturing on some basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. There is really nothing to offer. This kind of thinking is obviously one-sided and extremely wrong. We say that to do a good job in "double contributions," we should first start with doing a good job in our work. Every one of our members has their own work position. Since we have a work position, we should go all out, aim high, and work hard. We must do more, do it faster, do it better, and do it more economically. To achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, we must use our wisdom and exert our strength. Being able to use our wisdom better and exert more strength will enable us to make "double contributions." From the perspective of the work of middle and primary school teachers, it is to study and understand more deeply, and to implement the Party's education policy more comprehensively and thoroughly: education serves politics, and education is combined with productive labor. Improve the quality of education and train successors who meet the needs of socialist construction for the country. It should be recognized that improving quality is the greatest saving, and producing defective products is the greatest waste; this is the case in production units, and it is no exception in universities or middle and primary schools. Therefore, in this aspect of work, contributing wisdom and contributing strength is a great thing to do, and it should never be neglected or underestimated, and there will certainly be no problem of having nothing to contribute. We should affirm that all educators, whether experts in universities or teachers in middle and primary schools, just like other workers, peasants, laborers, and technical personnel, should unreservedly contribute their wisdom and strength in this great movement to increase production and practice economy, and they will certainly be able to contribute their wisdom and strength, do a good job in making "double contributions," and play their due role in our country's socialist construction.

    The erroneous views mentioned above have begun to have a unified and correct understanding through airing views, contending, and initial practice. Under the leadership of the Party and under the unified arrangement of the Party and administration of the work units where we are located, all our members closely combine transformation and service, and immediately and comprehensively invest in this great movement to increase production and practice economy, carry out this movement vigorously, and persist in it in a solid and practical way. Serving the center and strengthening transformation is the direction of the efforts of all our members. We will follow this direction, contribute wisdom and strength in our educational work, and strive to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party in this movement to increase production and practice economy.

### 中小学教师“无宝可献”吗？金通尹、唐哲委员的联合发言

　　中小学教师“无宝可献”吗？
　　金通尹、唐哲委员的联合发言
    我们听了周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告以及李维汉副主席所作中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，我们完全同意，并坚决贯彻实行。对于我们国家社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就和今年在去年全国人民大跃进的伟大胜利的基础上准备着更大更好更全面的跃进，感到非常兴奋。这样一个宏伟壮丽的计划，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，通过全国人民的积极努力，是完全能够实现的。
    为了保证一九五九年国民经济计划的完成和争取超额完成，李富春副总理说：“我们以为，在当前必须采取的各项组织措施中，最重要的一个环节，就是立即在国民经济的各个战线上，开展一个全民的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。”是的，这样一个以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，是当务之急的一个最重要的环节。增产节约是发展社会主义经济，扩大社会主义积累的基本方法，是中国共产党的光荣传统，是中国共产党三十多年来在革命和建设实践斗争中，发动群众，克服困难，从胜利走向胜利的行之有效的宝贵经验，是我国建设社会主义共产主义的长远方针。现在正在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展着的全民性的增产节约运动的中心环节，就是大闹技术革命，大搞技术革新，提高生产效率，提高生产质量；在贯彻鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的总路线的过程中，掀起一个新的高潮。
    湖北省武汉市中共各级党委今年以来，已经多次作了指示，号召全市人民积极投入以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，要求在这次运动中，做到人人献智慧，个个献力量，积极地做好双献。全市人民热烈地响应这个号召。各民主党派，各人民团体在党的领导下，也各自在自己的组织内，推动所有成员，积极地行动起来。广大工农劳动大众的知识分子，在各个工作岗位上，有不少的人已经订立了双献计划，准备在“五一”、“七一”以及“十周年国庆”等节日，向党献礼。创造发明，日有所闻。
    我们武汉市“民盟”和“民进”的成员，大多数是中小学教师，在以技术革新为中心的增产节约运动的号召初提出的时候，有一部分人这样想：工农群众和技术人员，天天在运用工具，无时无刻不接触到技术问题，熟能生巧，容易有创造发明；大学教授、科学研究机构的专家们既有高深的理论知识，又有丰富的实际经验，修养有素，千百万言的宏篇巨著，或者一篇有关尖端科学的专题论文，下一些苦功，加一番钻劲，就可以献出来，对于国计民生，大有价值。而中小学教师呢？只是日日夜夜，同一群娃娃们打交道，不是搞语文、历史，就是讲一些初级的数、理、化常识，实在没有什么东西可以献。这样想法，显然是片面的，也是极其错误的。我们说搞好“双献”，应该首先从搞好岗位工作开始，我们每一个成员，都有自己的工作岗位，既然有工作岗位，就应该鼓足干劲，力争上游，好好地工作。要做的多，做的快，做的好，做的省；要做到多、快、好、省，就要运用智慧和发挥力量，能够更好的运用智慧，更多的发挥力量，就能够有双献。从中小学教师的工作来讲，就是更深入地学习体会，更全面地、彻底地贯彻党的教育方针：教育为政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。提高教育质量，为国家培养符合社会主义建设的接班人。应该认识，提高质量，是最大的节约，生产废品次品，是最大的浪费；在生产单位是如此，在大专或中小学校也不例外。因此，在这方面的工作中，献智慧、献力量，是大有可为的，是决不应该轻视或者低估的，更不会发生没有东西可献的问题。我们应该肯定，一切教育工作者，无论是大专学校的专家们，无论是中小学的老师们，正如其他工农劳动人民和技术人员一样，在这次伟大的增产节约运动中，应该毫无保留地献出他们的智慧和力量，也一定能够献出他们的智慧和力量，搞好“双献”，为我国社会主义建设发挥应有的作用。
    前面所谈的错误看法，经过鸣放辩论，通过初步实践，已经开始有了统一的正确的认识了。我们全体成员在党的领导下，在所在工作单位党和行政的统一安排下，把改造与服务紧密地结合起来，立即全面地投入这个伟大的增产节约运动中，把这个运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，扎扎实实地坚持下去。服务中心，加强改造，是我们全体成员努力的方向，我们就依着这个方向，在教育工作中献智慧，献力量，为在这次增产节约运动中完成党交给我们的光荣任务而奋斗。
