    Basic Training and Literary Cultivation of a Stage Actor
    Ouyang Yuqian
    Any art requires basic training, like building a house. You must first lay a good foundation. If the foundation is not well laid, the house will easily collapse. Basic training should be gradual, not rushed or skipped. "A tower of ten thousand feet rises from the ground," so you must proceed step by step. Basic training must be done regularly and without interruption; once interrupted, all previous efforts may be wasted.
    For ballet, the basic training for girls should not be less than seven years, and for boys with special talents, the training period can be shortened. (According to the regulations of the Beijing Dance School, training starts from the age of eleven to thirteen for seven years.) Opera actors who practice martial arts also need to start from a young age. Learning Western music like piano and violin should start from the age of six or seven. In fine arts, such as oil painting and sculpture, you also need to go through a considerable period of basic training. Even in craftsmanship, to use a tool skillfully to the point of being able to handle it with ease, you have to put in a considerable amount of hard work. It is no exaggeration to say that the achievement of an art requires a lifetime of effort.
    Do stage actors need basic training? I think it is absolutely necessary. Of course, there is no need to start training from the age of eleven or twelve like ballet dancers or martial arts actors, but basic training in physical movements and lines is absolutely indispensable. The several units of performing techniques are also basic training. An actor as talented as Ulanova, who enjoys worldwide fame, has to do basic exercises every morning while holding on to the "bar." When Stanislavsky was seventy years old, he did gymnastics every morning and recited several poems. Mei Lanfang and Gai Jiaotian never stopped their basic exercises. As the saying goes, "A fist is no good if you don't practice, and a song is no good if you don't sing." There are no exceptions for stage actors. With a foundation in basic physical training, we can move our hands and feet flexibly, accurately, and beautifully, develop our bodies evenly, and correct physical defects and bad habits. To be able to do this, we can move as we want when we act. The expression is "body movements are easy and handy." Stage actors don't necessarily have to become dancers, but they must learn dance. Dance is an important part of basic training. It is best to master one kind of dance, which will be of great benefit to the performance. In this way, every part of the body can be used flexibly, and the movements can adapt to various rhythms. When acting, people will see your every move is measured and precise, clean, neat, and beautiful, instead of moving randomly. Moreover, some scenes in dramas require dance. We must never learn it temporarily when we need it. Doing so will cause you to fail on stage. Because Charlie Chaplin's dance and skating skills are quite high, some of his performances are particularly brilliant, increasing the appeal of his art, which is not easy for others to learn because they are unwilling to put in the effort. Most of our stage actors are most afraid of acting in fight scenes on stage, because most of them have not learned martial arts, and falling and tumbling always don't look real, because they can't control their bodies. They reluctantly cope, afraid of getting hurt, and it is not easy to look realistic.
    Basic training is also required for lines. To achieve a loud voice, clear diction, accurate pronunciation, clear meaning, and sonorous tone, you have to put a lot of effort into practice. The lines must not only be heard and understood by the audience, but also be pleasant to hear, loved to hear, and able to move them. We are now getting some feedback that it is often difficult to hear and understand stage plays. Does that mean that we don't even have the basic conditions? If there is such a phenomenon, it is intolerable. In fact, in recent years, due to the stage play community's unanimous recognition of the importance of lines, there has been great progress. In many plays and by many actors, the role of language can be brought into play on stage. This is already a good start. We should further pay attention to it and continuously improve it.
    Basic training is a necessary foundation for performing techniques. In the past, there was a period when people were afraid that emphasizing technique would neglect the ideology of the work, so they avoided talking about technique, and therefore did not pay enough attention to basic training. In fact, this kind of over-concern is unnecessary. The art cause is a part of the Party's cause. Needless to say, politics must be in command. With politics in command, technology must closely follow. For the sake of the Party's art cause, we need to use advanced technology. The bourgeoisie can master technology, and the proletariat should be able to master technology better than the bourgeoisie. Because the Soviet Union's science and technology surpassed capitalist countries, man-made planets went into space. Shouldn't our stage play performance technology catch up with the world level? We must improve the skills of screenwriters, directors, actors, musicians, stage artists, etc., in order to have works that combine higher ideology and artistry to serve socialist construction. Technique is an important component of skill. Without higher technique, there is no skill. Therefore, not only should we not avoid talking about technique, but we should also pay attention to technique, learn technique better, and improve technique. What we oppose is the bourgeoisie's pure technical viewpoint, and we never oppose technology, but we must promote technology.
    Stage actors obviously should have basic training, needless to say. Directors, stage artists, and theatrical creations should also have basic training. However, having only basic training is not enough; you must also have rich literary cultivation.
    Should stage actors learn some music? Stage actors should be able to sing. Singing is not only for vocal training for lines; there are also many places in stage plays where singing can be used. In addition, singing can spiritually enlighten an actor. If we don't have the narrow-minded idea of "treating a headache when the head hurts and treating a foot when the foot hurts," I think stage actors would not object to learning to sing, right? If you can also master a musical instrument, that would be even better and play a greater role. We rely on sister arts in many places! Ulanova made friends with several stage actors during her recuperation. According to her own account, she got great inspiration from their conversations, which greatly improved her performance. This is a very concrete and vivid example. In ancient times, there was a Huaisu and a Zhang Xu who were both famous for writing cursive script. They saw Gongsun Da Niang dancing with swords and their cursive script made great progress. Everyone thinks that Mei Lanfang is best at matching the colors of costumes, because he often studies Chinese paintings, and because he studies Chinese ancient paintings and sculptures, he created many beautiful body movements on stage. But these are direct and visible. There are also some good influences that are not direct and are not immediately visible. The ancients said to read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles. Reading ten thousand books means that you can indirectly acquire knowledge from books. Traveling ten thousand miles means learning from life. On the other hand, it also means broadening your horizons. The books of the ancients were large, and the characters were also large. Ten thousand volumes are extremely many, but if they are reduced to the current size five font, I am afraid they are not that many. Moreover, there were very few books in ancient times, and many young people could not read. Now we have books everywhere. We have whatever books we want. It depends on whether we are willing to read them. It is certainly wrong to specialize in books and not devote yourself to the fiery struggle, but if you don't read or read less, it is impossible to gain richer knowledge. Of course, reading should also be planned and step-by-step, and there should also be a focus.
    I think a stage actor should truly understand the Chinese people in order to perform them on stage. You must understand Chinese history, Chinese language, and Chinese social customs. We are not opposed to reading foreign novels, but Chinese novels must be read. Current novels, novels since the May Fourth Movement, and ancient novels should all be read, and you should also read some poetry. You must be able to understand ordinary classical Chinese. You must also have a certain ability to appreciate paintings, sculptures, and other works of art. An actor cannot give up the study of theory. Actors are not political commentators. In addition to having basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, they should also study general literary and artistic theories, so that their understanding of life and their insights into art will be deeper, which will help artistic creation.
    Literary cultivation is nutrition, not a medicine like aspirin. It may not have an immediate effect, but it can continuously enrich the blood and improve health. Literary cultivation is not the violent storm of summer, but the gentle breeze and sweet dew of spring. It is not a flash flood, but a continuous stream of spring water. Therefore, literary cultivation cannot be rushed but must be persistent. We should often absorb some nutrition, and the nutrition in literary cultivation is diverse, including ideological nourishment. Listening to reports and reading editorials is of great help to enlightening our thinking, but the thoughts in reports and editorials are still others' thoughts. To digest the essence of them into our own, we must experience them from life and struggle on the one hand, and we can also get confirmation from literary and artistic works on the other hand. From literary and artistic works, we can more deeply understand society and the relationship between people. Lenin said that Tolstoy was a mirror of the Russian revolution, because he reflected an unusually complex phenomenon of the Russian revolution, and you can deeply understand the Russian people from his works. I think that under the leadership of the Party, an art worker with communist consciousness and culture should have a certain degree of knowledge and literary cultivation of ancient and modern China and foreign countries.
    Regarding reading, I would also like to add a few words. I heard that Comrade Guo Moruo once said: "Tao Yuanming likes to read but does not seek thorough understanding, but now some people do not read but like to seek thorough understanding." It is certainly wrong not to read but like to seek thorough understanding. It depends on how to explain it if you like to read but do not seek thorough understanding. I think there are books of various natures. We cannot just grab any book and read it without a plan. Some books should be read carefully, and some books should be read lightly. In terms of literary and artistic works alone, I think there are also different ways to read them. If it is for literary cultivation, then focus on appreciation, and learn through appreciation and feeling. At the same time, as the ability to appreciate is continuously improved, the quality of creation can also be improved. If it is for academic research or theoretical criticism, then it needs to be analyzed. Of course, appreciation and analysis are not absolutely mutually exclusive. We can read literary and artistic works that we like one, two, or three times, and at the same time, we might as well read more in various ways (you can also read a little theoretical criticism along with it). If you read more, you will feel enlightened, and then you can also conduct some analysis and research on special topics. In the past, we had a period when we required that when reading a book, we had to thoroughly analyze it from the era background, the writer's life, the writer's thoughts, the creative methods, to the structure of the work and the vocabulary used, and raise a lot of questions, but we ignored the appreciation of the work. I think that for literary cultivation, it is not necessary to require every book to be read in this way. If you read too little, the ability to analyze will inevitably be weak. I think that the foundation of theoretical criticism must first be to read more and be able to appreciate it in order to give the work a correct evaluation. When we read, we naturally have hobbies, choices, appreciation, and criticism. Writers, actors, and theoretical critics have different focuses and degrees because they have different divisions of labor.
    Stage actors must have basic training, which is beyond doubt. We must better learn from the Soviet experience on the basis of Chinese artistic traditions, create a complete set of basic training methods, improve performing skills, and at the same time, constantly enrich literary cultivation, so that we can perform better plays with higher ideology and artistry to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. I hope that some necessary measures will be taken to ensure that these two legs are not lame. Drama academies and training classes in every theater troupe should pay special attention to this. I hope that the young people will work together. This is a little bit of my superficial understanding of this issue.

    话剧演员的基本训练与文艺修养
    欧阳予倩
    任何艺术都要有基本训练，好比造房子。必须先砸好地基，地基砸得不好，房子就容易垮。基本训练要循序渐进，不能着急，不能躐等，就是说不能跳，
  “万丈高楼从地起”要一步步来。基本训练要经常做而不能间断，一间断就可能前功尽弃。
    学芭蕾舞，女的基本训练不得少于七年，男的特别有才能的，可以缩短学习的年限。（照北京舞蹈学校的章程，从十一岁到十三周岁起开始训练七年。）戏曲演员练武工，也要从小起。学西洋音乐像钢琴小提琴从六、七岁就要练。美术方面像油画、雕塑也要经过相当长时间的基本训练。就是在工艺方面要把一样工具使用纯熟到得心应手的程度，也得下相当长的苦工。一艺之成，当费毕生之力，这话并不过分。
    话剧演员要不要基本训练？我想是十分必要。当然没有必要像芭蕾舞演员或武戏演员那样，从十一、二岁练起，但是形体动作和台词的基本训练是绝对不能缺少的，表演技术的几个单元也就是基本训练。乌兰诺娃那样天才的演员，享有全世界的盛名，她每天早上都要扶着“把儿”作基本练习。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基七十岁时，每天早上要做体操，还要朗诵好几首诗。梅兰芳和盖叫天基本练习也从来不断，俗话说“拳不离手、曲不离口”，话剧演员决没有例外。形体动作的基本训练有了基础，就会使我们抬手动脚灵活、准确、漂亮，使身体发展匀称，可以纠正在形体方面的毛病和不好的习惯。要能做到这样，我们演起戏来想怎么动就能怎么动，行话叫“身段随和，得心应手”。话剧演员不一定成为舞蹈家，但是必须要学习舞蹈，舞蹈是基本训练的一个重要部分，最好能精通一种舞蹈，对于表演会有很大的好处，这样整个身体的每一个部分都能灵活运用，而动作可以适应各种不同的节拍，演起戏来让人看你的一举一动，有分寸有板眼，干净，利落，好看，而不是随便乱动。而且话剧里头有些场面是用得着舞蹈的，我们决不能等到要用的时候临时去学，那样做会使你台上砸锅。像卓别麟因为他舞蹈和滑冰的技术相当高，有些场面他随便表演一点就特别精彩，增加了他艺术的吸引力，而人家不容易学到——因为不肯下工夫。我们大多数的话剧演员最怕在台上演打架的场面，因为大多数都没有学过武术，还有滑倒摔跤总是不像，因为不能控制形体，勉强应付，既怕摔伤，也就不容易像真。
    关于台词也要有基本训练，要做到声音嘹亮，口齿清楚、字音准确、语意明白、语调铿锵，就得下很大功夫去练。台词不仅让观众听得见、听得懂，还要让人听着觉得好听、爱听、听了要能受感动。我们现在得到些反映，说话剧的话往往听不见听不懂，难道说我们就连起码的条件都不具备了吗？如果真有这种现象，那是不能容忍的。事实上近年来由于话剧界一致认清了台词的重要性，有很大的进步，有好些个戏、好些演员都能在台上发挥语言的作用。这已经有了很好的开始。应当进一步加以注重，不断提高。
    基本训练是表演技术的必要基础。过去有一个时期，唯恐着重技术会忽略作品思想性，就避免谈技术，因此对基本训练也不够重视，实在这种过虑是不必要的。艺术事业是党的事业的一部分，不用说必须政治挂帅，政治挂了帅，技术就得紧紧跟上。为着党的艺术事业，需要运用高度的技术。资产阶级能够掌握技术，无产阶级应当比资产阶级更能掌握技术。苏联由于科学技术超过了资本主义国家，人造行星就上了天。难道我们话剧的表演技术就不应该赶上世界水平？我们应该有更高的思想性与艺术性相结合的作品来为社会主义建设服务，就必须提高编剧、导演、演员、音乐、舞台美术等各方面的技巧。技术是技巧的重要构成部分，没有较高的技术就谈不上技巧，因此非但不应当避免谈技术，还应当注重技术，要更好地学习技术，提高技术。我们所反对的是资产阶级的单纯技术观点，绝不反对技术，而且要提倡技术。
    话剧演员显然应当有基本训练自不用说，导演、舞台美术以及戏剧创作都应当有基本训练。可是单有基本训练还是不行，还必须有丰富的文艺修养。
    话剧演员要不要学点音乐呢？话剧演员应当会唱歌，唱歌不专为台词的练声，话剧里用得上歌唱的地方也并不少。除此之外，歌唱对于一个演员会有精神上的启发。如果我们不怀着“头痛医头脚痛医脚”的那种狭隘的想法，我想话剧演员不会反对学习唱歌吧？如果还能够掌握一样乐器，那就更好，更能发挥作用。我们依靠姊妹艺术帮助的地方多着哪！乌兰诺娃在她休养的时候，和几个话剧演员交了朋友，听到他们的谈话，据她自己说她得到很大的启发，使她在表演上有很大的进步，这是一个非常具体而生动的例子。我们古代有一个怀素有个张旭都是有名的会写草书，他们看见了公孙大娘舞剑器，草书大进。梅兰芳大家认为他最善于配服装的颜色，因为他经常研究中国画，而且他由于学习中国的古画和雕塑，在舞台上创造出许多优美的身段。但这些都是直接的，看得见的，还有些好的影响不是直接的，而且不是马上就看得见的。古人说要读万卷书，行万里路。读万卷书是说从书本中可以间接取得知识，行万里路是说向生活学习，另一方面也是说要扩大眼界。古人的书，本子大，字也很大，万卷是极言其多，但如果缩印成现在的五号字，恐怕也不见得很多。而且古人书很少，有好些青年人就读不到书，我们现在到处都是书，要什么书有什么书，就看愿不愿意读。专门钻到书本里，不投身到火热的斗争中去当然不对，但是如果不读书或少读书，那就不可能得到更丰富的知识。当然读书也应当有计划有步骤，也还要有重点。
    我想一个话剧演员要在台上表演中国人，应当真正懂得中国人，要懂得中国的历史、中国的语言、中国的社会和风俗习惯。我们不反对读外国小说，但是中国的小说必须要读，当前的小说，“五四”以来的小说和古代的小说都应该读一些，而且还应当读些诗歌，普通的文言文也一定要能看得懂。还有就是对绘画、雕刻等美术品要具备一定的欣赏能力。一个演员不能放弃对于理论的研究。演员不是政论家，除了必须具备马克思列宁主义的基本知识，对一般的文艺理论也应当学习，这样对生活的体会，对艺术的见解会更深刻，有助于艺术的创造。
    文艺修养是营养，不是像阿司匹林一类的药，不一定有急效，但可能不断地充实血液增进健康。文艺修养不是夏天的狂风骤雨，而是春天的和风甘露。不是山洪暴涨，而是源源不断的泉水。所以文艺修养不能着急而要有恒。我们应当经常吸收些营养，文艺修养方面的营养是多种多样的，包括思想的养料在内。听报告看社论对启发我们的思想有很大的帮助，但是报告和社论的思想还是别人的，要把其中精华部分消化成为自己的，那就一方面要从生活从斗争中去体验，另一方面，也可以从文艺作品当中得到印证。我们从文艺作品当中可以更深刻的了解社会，了解人与人的关系。列宁说托尔斯泰是俄国革命的镜子，因为他反映了俄国革命一个异常复杂的现象，从他的作品当中可以深刻的懂得俄罗斯人。我想在党的领导下一个有共产主义觉悟、有文化的艺术工作者，应当具备一定程度的古今中外的知识和文艺修养。
    关于读书，我还想补充几句，听说郭沫若同志曾说：“陶渊明好读书不求甚解，如今有些人不读书好求甚解。”不读书，好求甚解，当然不对；好读书，不求甚解，要看怎么解释——我以为书有各种性质的书，我们不能毫无计划随便抓过来就读，有的书要精读，有的书涉猎一下就行了。单就文艺作品而言，我想也有不同的读法，如果为的是文艺修养，那就着重欣赏，通过欣赏、感受而得到学习，同时由于欣赏力的不断提高，也就可以提高创作的质量。如果是为着学术研究，或理论批评，那就要分析。当然欣赏和分析不是绝然互不相谋的。我们对于自己所喜爱的文艺作品，可以读一遍两遍三遍，同时不妨各种各样的多读一些，（也可以随带着读一点理论批评），读多了就会感到豁然贯通，然后也可以就专题进行些分析研究。过去我们曾经有一个时期，要求读一本书就得从时代背景、作家的生平、作家的思想、创作方法、一直到作品的结构和所用的语汇等等，巨细无遗作彻底的分析，提出一大堆的问题，反而忽略了对作品的欣赏。我想为了文艺修养不必读每本书都这样要求。如果读书太少，分析的能力也就必然薄弱，我想理论批评的基础首先也还是要多读，也要能欣赏，才能给与作品以正确的估价。我们读书自然有爱好有选择有欣赏有批判，作家、演员、理论批评家因为有所分工，所以着重点有程度的不同罢了。
    话剧演员必须有基本训练，这是不容怀疑的，我们要在中国艺术传统的基础上更好的学习苏联的经验，搞出一套完整的基本训练方法，提高表演技巧，同时要经常不断地丰富文艺修养，这样才能演出更好的、思想性和艺术性更高的戏，以满足广大人民群众的要求。希望采取一些必要的措施，保证这两条腿一条不瘸。话剧学院和每一个剧团的训练班都应当特别重视。希望青年们一同努力，这是我对这个问题的一点浅薄的体会。
