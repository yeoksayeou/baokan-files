　　Iron Mountain Blossoms
　　Niu Yingjun, Wang Wenliang

　　At 12:00 noon on April 30th, a deafening roar echoed from the summit of the Baiyun Obo main ore deposit, more than 1,700 meters above sea level, followed by soil blossoms bursting into the sky. At that moment, more than 10,000 builders of various nationalities gathered around the mine couldn't help but cheer: another modern mine in the motherland has been put into production.

　　The sound of the blasting still reverberated in the high sky. Suddenly, another thrilling battle scene appeared before us. The five electric locomotives on the main mine roared simultaneously, and the Ural giant from the Soviet Union—a giant electric shovel that could swallow four cubic meters of ore in one bite—swung its huge arm. A few tens of minutes later, electric locomotives loaded with iron ore sped along the mountain railway, passed through a siding, and arrived at the top of the rich ore tank. The locomotive roared, the dump truck twisted, and a waterfall of ore rolled down. In the rich ore tank, a chain feeder welcomed the iron ore. Like five fingers, it evenly stirred the rushing iron ore and then sent the ore into the belly of the crusher via a belt conveyor. When the iron ore poured out from the bottom of the crusher, various sizes of iron ore had become fragments with a diameter of five to six centimeters. After being screened by a vibrating screen, it followed the prescribed route, passed through a belt corridor suspended high in the air, and reached a storage tank more than 20 meters above the ground. Below the storage tank, a long train of wagons, aligned with funnels equipped with automatic switches, waited to transport the ore to the blast furnace. In this way, the world-famous Baiyun Obo iron mine began its mechanized production process.

　　We couldn't help but think of the scene two years ago. At that time, the entire mining area had only a few sparse rows of houses left by geological exploration teams. The arid grassland lacked water for construction, and any screw or small tool needed for the project had to be transported from Baotou City, more than 150 kilometers away.

　　"The poorer, the more revolutionary," was the heroic slogan put forward by the workers in the early stage of construction. Despite the many difficulties, they would never succumb to them and were determined to change the backwardness of the grassland with their heroic labor. In those days, all kinds of heroes showed their skills, and beautiful flowers competed for beauty. Three master foundry workers, empty-handed, started from scratch to make blowers, melting furnaces, and cupolas, determined to turn ore into pig iron and then into a large number of castings; the construction site needed a large number of welding machines, and the workers in the power workshop were determined to manufacture them themselves, and the quality had to catch up with the domestic advanced level. The supply of wooden templates needed for the project was insufficient, so the old worker Zhang Zhenying created a flip-over reinforced concrete template, and a wooden template could be used 200 times; facing more than 5.6 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework, there were only four excavators, and the workers of the mechanical railway team made revolution on the excavators, so that four excavators could replace five. In July last year, the construction of the medium crushing system entered the concrete pouring stage, and more than 30,000 cubic meters of concrete workload were concentrated together. The workers calculated that if ordinary mixers and vibrators were used for construction, the project would have to be delayed until July of this year to be completed. According to the needs of the project, three-quarters of the mixers and vibrators were not available at that time. While everyone was worried, the old fitter "Jack-of-all-trades" Qiao Chunzhuan and engineer Gu Yuechuan and others proposed the method of pressure grouting, which increased work efficiency by four to seven times, and the project was completed in only two months. The workers of the mechanical installation team followed them and completed the installation workload of 300 tons of equipment, which usually takes one and a half months, in only ten days.

　　Baiyun Obo has now become the first-class large iron mine in the motherland. Look, this grassland, which used to have only two yurts, now has buildings and bungalows forming neat blocks, and factory buildings such as the central machine repair shop, locomotive depot, crushing plant, and traction substation in the industrial site are closely arranged. Electric railways extend in all directions, and high-voltage power lines extend between the mountain tops. All of this tells people: the current Baiyun Obo is no longer a deserted grassland, but a bustling industrial city.

　　铁山开花
　　牛英俊　王文亮
    4月30日中午十二时，在拔海一千七百多公尺的白云鄂博主矿山顶上，传来一阵轰然巨响，紧接着，朵朵土花腾空而起。这时，聚集在矿山周围的一万多名各民族的建设者，情不自禁地欢呼起来：祖国又一座现代化的矿山投入了生产。
    大爆破的声音还在高空中回转。忽然我们面前出现了另外一番惊心动魄的战斗场面。主矿山上的五辆电机车，同时轰鸣，从苏联来的乌拉尔巨人——一口可以吞进四立方公尺矿石的大电铲，挥动它的巨臂。几十分钟以后，满载铁矿石的电机车奔驰在环山铁路上，穿过一处会让站，来到了富矿槽的顶端，机车吼叫一声，翻斗车扭动身躯，瀑布一样的矿石就滚滚而下。在富矿槽里，迎接铁矿石的是链式给矿机，它像人的五个手指一样，把涌来的铁矿石扒弄均匀，然后让矿石随着皮带运输机送进破碎机的肚子里。当铁矿石从破碎机的底部倾泻而出的时候，各种大小不等的铁矿石已经变成直径五至六公分的碎块。经过震动筛筛选，沿着规定的道路，穿过斜架在高空中的皮带走廊，走到离地面二十多公尺高贮矿槽里去了。贮矿槽的下面，一列长长的火车车皮，对准了一个个有自动开关装置的漏斗，等待着接运矿石到高炉上去。白云鄂博这座举世闻名的铁矿山，就这样地开始了它的机械化生产的过程。
    我们情不自禁地想起了两年以前的情景。那时，整个矿区只有地质勘探队员们留下来的几排疏疏落落的房子。干旱的草原上缺乏施工用水，工程上需要的任何一个螺丝钉、一件小工具，都得从一百五十公里以外的包头市运来。
    “越穷越革命”，这是建设初期职工们提出的英雄口号。困难尽管很多，他们决不在困难面前屈服，一定要以自己的英勇劳动，改变草原上的落后面貌。在那些日子里，真是各路英雄显神通，好花奇貌竞相妍。三个赤手空拳的铸工老师傅，白手起家制成鼓风机、熔铁炉、冲天炉，定要叫矿石变成生铁然后变成大批铸件；工地上需要大量电焊机，动力车间的工人下决心自己制造，并且质量要赶上国内先进水平。工程上需要的木模板供应不足，老工人张振英就创造翻转钢筋混凝土模板，一块木模板可用到二百次；在五百六十多万方的土石方工程面前，只有四台挖土机，机械铁路队的工人就在挖土机上闹革命，叫四台挖土机顶上五台使用。去年7月，中破碎系统的工程进入浇灌混凝土阶段，三万多立方公尺的混凝土工作量集中到一起，工人们算了一下，如果采用通常使用的搅拌机、震动棒进行施工，工程起码要拖延到今年7月才能完工。按照工程需要，当时有四分之三的搅拌机和震动棒没有着落，大家正在发愁的时候，老钳工“多面手”乔春专和工程师顾月川等提出了用压力灌浆的办法，工作效率提高四倍到七倍，工程只用了两个月就完成了。机械安装队的工人们继他们之后，只用了十天时间就完成了通常要一个半月才能完成的、三百吨的设备安装工作量。
    白云鄂博，现在已经成为祖国第一流的大铁矿。看吧，过去只有两个蒙古包的这片草原，现在楼房平房已组成了一条条整齐的街坊，工业场地上的中心机修厂、机车库、破碎厂、牵引变电所等厂房栉比错落。电气铁路四通八达，高压电线伸延在各个山颠之间。这一切的一切，告诉人们：现在的白云鄂博已经不再是荒漠的草原，而是一座繁嚣的工业城市了。
