Datong Mine in Huainan Finds an Important Way to Improve Labor Productivity
By Guo Longchun, our reporter

Improving labor productivity is an important part of realizing the 1959 leap forward plan for the national economy. In theory, labor productivity is the efficiency with which people create material wealth in a certain period. If time and tasks remain constant, the less labor used and the more reasonably labor is used, the higher the labor productivity will naturally be. In general industrial and mining enterprises, is there still potential to tap in labor? How can labor be saved? How can labor be used more reasonably? The reporter conducted an investigation on these issues at the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan City.

Potential Indeed Exists

Last year, Datong Mine produced more than 950,000 tons of coal, an increase of 27% over 1957. This year, the state requires Datong Mine to produce 1.3 million tons of raw coal, an increase of 36% over the great leap forward year of 1958. The output of steel mills, coking plants and other satellite factories will also increase. With increased tasks, people naturally think of increasing personnel. The mine initially planned to add 1,700 people, but after calculating, it would need at least 400; the plan to add 400 people was formally reported to the leading organs. However, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Huainan Municipal Committee required all factories and mines not only not to increase personnel, but also to transfer some labor to support newly built enterprises and agricultural production.

Since people were not available, and production had to make a great leap forward, what should be done? Only by turning back to tap the potential of labor within the enterprise.

At that time, some cadres regarded "increased production must increase people" as an "objective law". Some people also emphasized that Datong Mine is an old mine with poor production conditions, and it had also streamlined its organization last year, believing that there was no potential to tap in labor.

The Huainan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the potential of labor still exists. Not only can production be increased without increasing personnel, but also personnel can be streamlined. The reasons are: First, a lot of people have been added in the second half of last year. At that time, due to lack of experience and urgent tasks, the labor force was not arranged reasonably enough, resulting in varying degrees of idleness and waste in enterprises, especially in newly built units; Second, the further development of tool reform and technical innovation movements can greatly improve labor efficiency and reduce personnel; Third, after the great leap forward in 1958, the political consciousness and technical level of the workers and the management level of the enterprises have been greatly improved, which can improve production efficiency and use less manpower.

The actual situation of Datong Mine is also true.

At the end of June last year, there were 2,289 employees in the entire mine. With the great development of production in the second half of the year, personnel increased successively. According to statistics in mid-January this year, there were a total of 5,204 people in the entire mine (including 1,032 employees from three satellite factories such as the newly built steel mill, coking plant, and cement plant). The increase in personnel ensured the great leap forward in coal production and also began to produce new products such as steel, iron, coke, and cement. However, because many people were added in a short period of time, there was still a lot of potential that had not been brought into play, and there were also some wastes in the use of labor. The workers were also dissatisfied with the excessive number of people. The mine Party committee launched a great debate among the workers to discuss whether there was any potential for labor. The workers in the entire mine posted 6,756 big-character posters in three days, putting forward 7,349 opinions, and sharply criticized the phenomena of overstaffing and unreasonable labor organization. For example, someone posted a big-character poster criticizing the saw room: "Two people work, seven people watch, idle and chat nonsense." Someone posted a big-character poster in the canteen: "Overstaffing counts the canteen, too much division of labor is famous: washing bowls, selling meals, selling vegetables each manages each, one person can only manage one thing. Advanced experience is not promoted, personnel are inevitably too many." Some big-character posters also pointed out that unreasonable labor organization would not only cause waste of manpower and financial resources, but also affect the enthusiasm of the workers.

Ways to Streamline Organizations

After investigation and investigation, and organizing workers to speak out, the mine Party committee proved that there was indeed a lot to be done in tapping the potential of labor, so it mobilized all the workers in the mine to take the following measures to rectify labor organization and vigorously streamline organizations.

Merge organizations and use manpower uniformly. For example, the workers who wash coking coal and the coking workers originally belonged to two departments. Now they are all under the leadership of the factory management section, and the manpower is uniformly allocated, saving 54 people.

Concentrate workers of the same type of work. In the past, the three mining areas and the electromechanical section all had underground machine repair workers. Now they are concentrated to form a mechanical installation and repair team to work in various mining areas, reducing 42 people. The iron workers of the management section, electromechanical section, and factory management section are concentrated for use, and the number of people has also been reduced from 24 to 14.

Implement concurrent operations and joint operations. For example, the loading and unloading workers on the ground, some used to be responsible for loading coal onto trains, some were responsible for loading dump trucks at the coal bunker opening, and some were responsible for unloading wood from trains. The division of labor was too detailed and rigid, and personnel had to be assigned according to the busy work situation, which would lead to idleness and waste in normal times. Now it has been changed to joint operations, and whatever work comes, everyone does it together, resulting in a saving of 65 people.

More importantly, on the basis of tapping potential, determine the number of personnel and quotas according to the actual situation. For example, in the past, the ratio of canteen staff to diners was almost 1 to 25, and there was a lot of waste of manpower; now it has been changed to 1 to 50, reducing a total of 65 people. The mine has now formulated a staffing manual, which specifically stipulates the number of personnel and work responsibilities according to departments and types of work, and is preparing to further determine work quotas for time-rate workers according to types of work, so that leaders can have a clear idea and everyone has clear responsibilities, so as to consolidate the results of rectifying labor organization from the management system.

In addition, the mine also contracted out the two tasks of weaving bamboo fences and making bricks to the neighborhood committees on the premise of ensuring supply, which also reduced 115 people.

These are all ways to streamline organizations. But not all methods are applicable to all units and types of work, and specific analysis needs to be made according to the specific situation. When carrying out these tasks, Datong Mine, according to the instructions of the Huainan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, paid attention to implementing three principles: (1) ensure safety; (2) do not increase the labor intensity of workers; (3) be lasting and feasible. These principles prevented deviations from occurring in the process of streamlining organizations, and made the new labor organization based on both advanced and practical basis.

Assign People According to Their Talents and Ensure Key Points

The ratio of production personnel to non-production personnel, and the ratio of direct production personnel to auxiliary personnel, have a great relationship with the rational use of labor and the level of labor productivity. Labor shortages are also often related to the excessive proportion of non-production personnel and auxiliary personnel. The principle of Datong Mine's rectification of labor organization is: drastically reduce non-production personnel, greatly reduce auxiliary personnel, and slightly reduce direct production personnel. Excavation workers, etc., have also been appropriately increased in order to expand production and cultivate technical strength for new coal mines. The comrades in the mine call this a "chessboard" in the use of labor – unified arrangement and ensuring key points.

Before and after the rectification of the organization, the allocation of mining workers (coal miners, tunneling workers) and auxiliary workers among the raw coal workers was:

                        Mining Workers 	Auxiliary Workers
Original Number 	1,391 	1,663
New Plan Number 	1,007 	997

It can be seen from this table that not only has the number of mining workers and auxiliary workers decreased, but also the ratio between the two has changed. Before the rectification, the ratio of mining workers to auxiliary workers was 1 to 1.2; after the rectification, it was 1 to 0.9. This is more reasonable than before.

In the process of rectifying the labor organization, they also assigned people according to their talents based on the characteristics of various workers. Male workers are not used for jobs that female workers can do, and young and strong people are not used for jobs that weak people can do. Now, many of the young and middle-aged male workers in various types of work on the ground have been driven underground by the "Mu Guiyings". 21% of the workers in the electromechanical section are now female workers, and 54% of the canteen staff are women. The mine Party committee is preparing to continue to transfer young and middle-aged female workers from non-production departments and auxiliary departments, and train them to take on the work of handling, dispatching, and small train drivers, so as to transfer more male workers to the production front to expand production or support newly built enterprises.

Earth Mechanical Replaces Manual Labor

To fully tap the potential of labor, and ensure that the streamlining of organizations does not increase the labor intensity of workers, and that the new labor organization plan is lasting and feasible, it is necessary to carry out technical revolution and technical innovation on a large scale.

The content of technical innovation in Datong Mine is very wide, such as promoting the light-duty shield support coal mining method, improving development design, promoting cross-operation of double pneumatic picks, and cross-operation of tunneling, grooving, splitting, and coal loading, etc. What is particularly worth introducing is the improvement of tools and equipment and the vigorous development of small-scale mechanization.

This mine is a modern enterprise, but many production links are still manual operations, and the efficiency of some machinery and equipment is not high enough. The mine Party committee mobilized the masses to improve tools and equipment from all aspects according to the principle of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods. In three months, the workers in the entire mine put forward thousands of rationalization proposals. From production departments to auxiliary departments, everyone is looking for tricks and making innovations. The transportation system has achieved "fiveizations" – electrification of main transportation roadways, mechanization of waist alley transportation, winch-powered material pulling in small tunnels, pneumatic loading and unloading at wellheads, and vehicle transportation on the ground. Even the canteen has created new tools such as vegetable cutting machines and honeycomb rice adders.

Now, many new equipment can be seen above ground and underground. They are all designed and manufactured by the workers of this mine themselves using old materials and other materials. This equipment costs very little money and looks simple, but it plays a big role in improving efficiency and saving labor.

At the wellhead 330 meters underground, the reporter visited the "pneumatic tank loading machine" created by transportation worker Ding Rongde and others. Just by modifying a section of the track, installing a switch, and using the wind power used by the pneumatic pick, the coal tanks can be automatically loaded and unloaded, saving three people who push the coal tanks every day and ensuring safety. I also saw a simple "slurry mixer" near the wellhead on the ground. In the past, mud slurry (used for fire prevention underground) was mixed with rakes, and eight people surrounded two ponds to stir it, which was both laborious and not easy to mix evenly; with this "mixer", one person can start it to complete the task quickly and well.

In the satellite factories, after the crushing of iron ore, screening, and charging of small blast furnaces were changed to mechanical methods, a large amount of manpower was saved. What is particularly noteworthy is the "shaker" in the cement plant. In the past, workers used their hands to rub the raw materials into round balls, which was very inefficient. Later, the workers made a large cylinder out of bamboo, lined it with a layer of mud, and used a small motor to drive it, so that the raw materials were gradually shaken into spherical shapes in the cylinder. This simple "shaker" replaced 80 workers at once and ensured production safety.

More than 300 technical innovations that have been opened up by Datong Mine have replaced hundreds of workers. After the rectification of the labor organization, technical innovation will be the regular and main way to save labor.

Efficient Troops

Datong Mine has rectified its labor organization, streamlined its organizations, and basically eliminated the phenomenon of waste of manpower such as idleness. Most units in the entire mine not only do not need to add people, but also streamlined a total of 1,720 people, accounting for 33% of the total number of employees in the entire mine (of which the satellite factories streamlined 522 people, accounting for more than 50% of the original number of people). As of the end of April, the units had actually streamlined 1,241 people (of which the satellite factories had streamlined 438 people). Now, the entire mine has transferred 650 people to support agricultural production and 96 people to support fraternal enterprises. Some people have also been transferred to the mining, electromechanical departments for training, preparing to support other mines. In addition, some people, according to the instructions of their superiors, have opened up new businesses such as the production of lead wire, foreign nails and other things needed for coal mines.

With the number of people reduced a lot, the output has increased, and labor productivity has been significantly improved. From the middle of January when the rectification of the labor organization began, to March, the initial results of a great harvest were obtained. In this month, the entire mine exceeded the plan by 8%, producing more than 120,000 tons of coal, an increase of 70% over the same period last year, and an increase of 19% over December of last year, which had the highest output, creating a new record since the mine was opened; the efficiency of all employees reached 1.514 tons per work, an increase of 25% over the same period last year, and an increase of 22% over the average efficiency of all employees throughout last year; the production cost was also 26% lower than the same period last year, and 28% lower than the average production cost throughout last year. In April, the production level of this mine was further improved.

This is the initial achievement of Datong Mine in tapping the potential of labor. The mine Party committee has further plans: First, improve the labor management and production responsibility system (mainly staffing quota management), and always pay attention to adjusting the labor organization; Second, establish full-time labor wage administrators among the workers to establish a broad mass base for labor management; Third, deeply carry out the technical revolution. These measures can ensure the complete realization of the new labor organization plan, ensure the economical and rational use of labor, and better improve labor productivity.

    队伍精干　人尽其才
    淮南大通矿找到了提高劳动生产率的重要途径
    本报记者　郭龙春
    提高劳动生产率是实现1959年国民经济跃进计划的重要环节。从道理上讲，劳动生产率是人们在一定时间内创造物质财富的效率，在时间、任务不变的情况下，如果人力用得越少，劳动力使用得越合理，劳动生产率自然就越高。在一般工矿企业里，究竟劳动力还有没有潜力可挖？怎样可以节约劳动力？劳动力怎样能使用得更合理？记者在淮南市大通煤矿就这几个问题作了调查。
    确有潜力
    大通矿去年生产了九十五万多吨煤，年产量比1957年增长了27％。今年，国家要求大通矿生产原煤一百三十万吨，比大跃进的1958年又增长36％。钢铁厂、炼焦厂等卫星厂的产量也要增长。任务增加了，人们自然想到要增加人。矿里最初打算要一千七百人，后来经过算账，至少也得要四百；要四百人的计划，正式报给了领导机关。可是，中共安徽省委、淮南市委要求各厂矿不但不增加人，还要抽调一部分劳动力支援新建企业和农业生产。
    人是要不到了，生产又必须大跃进，怎么办？只有回过头来，挖掘企业内部劳动力的潜力。
    当时，有些干部把“增产必须增人”当作是“客观规律”。有的人还强调大通矿是老矿，生产条件差，去年也曾精简过机构，认为劳动力已经没有潜力可挖。
    中共淮南市委认为：劳动力的潜力还是存在的。不但增产可以不增人，而且可以精减人。理由是：第一、去年下半年已经增加了不少人，当时由于缺乏经验，任务紧迫，劳动力安排得不够合理，造成企业中不同程度的窝工浪费现象，特别是新建单位更为突出；第二、工具改革和技术革新运动的进一步开展，可以大大提高劳动效率，减少人员；第三，经过1958年的大跃进，职工的政治觉悟、技术水平和企业的管理水平，都有了很大的提高，可以提高生产效率，少用人力。
    大通矿的实际情况也正是如此。
    去年6月底全矿有二千二百八十九名职工。下半年生产大发展，人员陆续增加，据今年1月中旬的统计，全矿共有五千二百零四人（包括新建的钢铁厂、炼焦厂、水泥厂等三个卫星厂的一千零三十二名职工）。人员的增加，保证了煤炭生产的大跃进，同时开始生产出钢、铁、焦炭、水泥等新产品。但是因为短时间内人员增加很多，还有不少潜力没有发挥出来，在劳动力使用上也有某些浪费现象。职工群众对人员过多也不满意。矿党委发动职工大鸣大放，讨论劳动力有无潜力时，全矿职工三天贴出六千七百五十六张大字报，提出七千三百四十九条意见，对人浮于事、劳动组织不合理的现象提出了尖锐的批评。例如，有人贴大字报批评轮锯房：“二人干，七人看，闲来无事瞎扯淡。”有人贴食堂的大字报：“人浮于事数食堂，分工过细有名堂：涮碗、卖饭、卖菜各管各，一人只能管一桩。先进经验不推广，人员未免太过多。”有的大字报还指出，劳动组织不合理，不仅会造成人力财力的浪费，还影响职工积极性的发挥。
    精简机构的门路
    矿党委经过调查摸底，组织职工鸣放，证明挖掘劳动力潜力确实大有可为，便发动全矿职工采取下列措施，整顿劳动组织，大力精简机构。
    合并机构，统一使用人力。例如，洗焦煤的工人和炼焦工人原来分属两个部门，现在都划归工厂管理科领导，人力统一调配，节省五十四人。
    同工种工人集中使用。过去三个采掘区和机电科都有井下机修工，现在集中起来，成立机械安装检修队，到各采掘区工作，减少了四十二个人。经理科、机电科、工厂管理科三个单位的铁工集中使用，也由二十四人减少到十四人。
    实行兼职作业、联合作业。例如，地面的装卸工，过去有的专门负责把煤装上火车，有的负责在煤仓口装斗车，有的负责从火车上卸木料，分工过细过死，又要分别按照工作繁忙时的情况配备人员，平时就有窝工浪费现象。现在改为联合作业，哪项工作来了就一起干哪项工作，结果节省了六十五个人。
    更重要的措施，是在挖掘潜力的基础上，根据实际情况定员定额。例如，过去食堂工作人员同用膳人员的比例差不多是1比25，人力有不少浪费；现在改成1比50，共精减六十五人。矿里现在已经制定出定员手册，按部门分工种具体规定了人员数目和工作职责，准备进一步对计时工人按工种确定工作定额，以便领导心中有数，人人责任分明，从管理制度上巩固整顿劳动组织的成果。
    另外，这个矿还把编竹笆、制砖两项工作在保证供应的前提下，包给居民委员会，也减少了一百一十五人。
    这些都是精简机构的门路。但不是所有办法都适用于各个单位、各个工种，需要根据具体情况作具体分析。大通矿在进行这几项工作时，根据中共淮南市委的指示，注意贯彻了三个原则：（一）确保安全；（二）不增加工人的劳动强度；（三）要持久可行。这些原则防止了在精简机构过程中发生偏差，使新的劳动组织建立在既先进又切实可行的基础上。
    量才用人　保证重点
    生产人员和非生产人员的比例、直接生产人员和辅助人员的比例，对于劳动力的合理使用、劳动生产率的高低有很大关系。劳动力紧张，也常常与非生产人员、辅助人员比重过大有关。大通矿整顿劳动组织的原则是：非生产人员狠减，辅助人员大减，直接生产人员少减。掘进工等还适当增加，以便扩大生产，并为新煤井培养技术力量。矿里的同志把这叫做劳动力使用上的“一盘棋”——统一安排，保证重点。
    整顿机构前后，原煤工人当中采掘工（采煤工人、掘进工人）和辅助工的配备情况是：
                  采掘工　辅助工
      原有人数　  1，391　1，663
      新方案人数　1，007   　997
    从这个表可以看出，不但采掘工和辅助工的人数都减少了，而且二者的比例发生了变化。整顿以前，采掘工和辅助工的比例是1比1.2；整顿以后是1比0.9。这样就比以前合理了。
    在整顿劳动组织过程中，他们还根据各种工人的特点量才使用。凡是女工能担任的工作不用男工，凡是体弱的人能担任的工作不用年青力壮的人。现在，地面上各个工种的青壮年男工，有很多都被“穆桂英”们赶到井下去了。机电科21％的工人已是女工，食堂工作人员54％已是妇女。矿党委准备继续从非生产部门、辅助部门抽调青壮年女工，训练她们担任打点、调度、小火车司机等工作，以便调出更多的男工开赴生产前线，去扩大生产，或者支援新建企业。
    土机械代替人工
    要充分挖掘劳动力的潜力，并保证精简机构后确实不增加工人的劳动强度，使新的劳动组织方案持久可行，必须大搞技术革命和技术革新。
    大通矿技术革新的内容很广泛，重要的如推广轻型掩护支架采煤法，改进开拓设计，推行双风镐交叉作业以及掘进、掏槽、劈帮、装煤交叉作业，等等。特别值得介绍的是改进工具设备，大搞小型机械化。
    这个矿是个现代化的企业，但是许多生产环节还是手工操作，有的机器设备效率也不够高。矿党委发动群众根据自力更生、土洋结合的原则，从各方面改进工具设备。三个月，全矿职工就提了上千条合理化建议。从生产部门到辅助部门，大家都在找窍门，闹革新。运输系统已经实现了“五化”——主要运输巷道电车化，腰巷运输机械化，小眼拉料绞车化，井口装卸风动化，地面运输车子化。甚至食堂也创造了切菜机、蜂窝加米器等新工具。
    现在，井上、井下可以看到许多新设备。它们都是这个矿的职工自己设计、自己利用旧器材等制造的。这些设备花钱很少，看来简单，但是对于提高效率、节省劳力作用很大。
    记者在地下三百三十公尺的井口，参观了运输工人丁荣德等创造的“风动装罐机”。只是改装了一段轨道，安了个开关，利用风镐使用的风力，就能自动装卸煤罐，每天可以节省三个推煤罐的人，又能保证安全。我还在地面井口附近看了一台构造简单的“泥浆搅拌机”。过去和泥浆（井下防火用）用耙子，八个人围着两个池子搅和，又劳累又不容易拌匀；有了这台“搅拌机”，一个人开动，就能又快又好地完成任务。
    在卫星厂里，破碎铁矿石、筛料、小高炉上料等改用机械以后，节省了大批人力。特别引人注意的是水泥厂的“摇料器”。过去工人用手把原料揉成圆球，效率很低，后来工人用竹子做了个大圆筒，里面搪层泥坯，用小马达带动，原料就在圆筒内陆续摇成球形。这个简单的“摇料器”，一下子代替了八十个工人，而且保证了生产安全。
    大通矿已经开放的三百多枝技术革新的花朵，代替了几百名工人。整顿劳动组织以后，技术革新将是节约劳动力的经常的主要的门路。
    兵精效率高
    大通矿整顿劳动组织，精简了机构，基本上消除了窝工等浪费人力现象。全矿绝大部分单位不但不需要再增加人，还一共精简出一千七百二十人，占全矿原有职工总数的33％（其中卫星厂精简五百二十二人，占原有人数50％以上）。截至4月末，各单位实际已经精简出一千二百四十一人（其中卫星厂已精简四百三十八人）。现在，全矿已经调出六百五十人支援农业生产，调出九十六人支援兄弟企业。还有一些人调到采掘、机电部门培训，准备支援外矿。另外有一部分人根据上级指示，开辟了生产煤矿需要的铅丝、洋钉等新业务。
    人员减少了很多，产量却增加了，劳动生产率更有显著提高。从1月中旬开始整顿劳动组织，到3月份便初步获得了大丰收的果实。这个月全矿超过计划8％，生产了十二万多吨煤，比去年同期增长了70％，比去年产量最高的12月份增长19％，创造了开矿后的新纪录；全员效率达到每工一点五一四吨，比去年同期提高25％，比去年全年平均全员效率提高22％；生产成本也比去年同期降低26％，比去年全年平均生产成本降低28％。4月份，这个矿的生产水平又有提高。
    这是大通矿挖掘劳动力潜力的初步成就。矿党委还有进一步的打算：第一、健全劳动管理和生产责任制度（主要是定员定额管理），经常注意调整劳动组织；第二、在工人中设立不脱产的劳动工资管理员，为劳动管理工作建立广泛的群众基础；第三、深入开展技术革命。这些措施可以保证新劳动组织方案的彻底实现，保证经常节省地、合理地使用劳动力，更好地提高劳动生产率。
