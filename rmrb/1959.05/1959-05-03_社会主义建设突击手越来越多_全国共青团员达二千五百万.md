Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Chinese Communist Youth League organization, the core of the national youth movement, has been further consolidated and developed under the leadership of the Party, after the rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward of 1958. At present, there are 25 million Communist Youth League members and more than one million Communist Youth League branches across the country.

Since last winter and this spring, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels have accepted more than 2 million new members. These new members have been educated and cultivated by the Party and the League organizations for a long time, and are all young activists from all walks of life who have emerged from the Great Leap Forward. Most of them are from worker-peasant backgrounds, with firm positions, high political awareness, and the ability to connect with the masses. According to a survey of nine counties in Henan, among the 18,425 new members, those from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds accounted for 88.7% of the total new members. According to statistics of 7,136 new members in Leibei and the suburbs of Shantou City and some communes in Guangdong, workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants accounted for 95.6%. Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the consolidation and development of the Communist Youth League organizations. This is the basic guarantee for the smooth progress of the League's organizational development work.

Among these new members, female members account for more than 30%. This shows that Chinese young women are playing an increasingly important role in socialist construction. Especially in rural areas, the establishment of people's communes has liberated the majority of women from household labor, giving them the opportunity to make greater contributions to socialist construction. In various ethnic minorities, many outstanding young people have also joined the Communist Youth League organization.

Among this group of newly developed League members, there are many advanced producers, labor models in industry and agriculture, technical innovation experts, and young socialist construction activists. Among the 464 new League members developed in Liuzhou City, various model figures accounted for 64.22%; 69.3% of the new members received in Zhanjiang City were rated as meritorious or commended. Among the new members are Chen Chaoguang, a young production model of Zhangshi Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, who has been awarded seven times in a row for his skills in rice transplanting and harrowing, Xu Linlong, a "steel youth red shock worker" and a young socialist construction activist in Shanghai. He is an apprentice in the steel pouring section of the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6. Because he loves his work and learns modestly, he has mastered the relatively complex steel pouring technology in just three or four months and has trained two skilled steel pouring workers with his master. Jin Zhilan, a literacy activist and volunteer literacy teacher of Ji Hu Ying Street, Beicheng District, Taiyuan City; Zhang Tingying from Shandong Province, who created a yield of 7,303 jin per mu of yellow tobacco and 40,000 jin per mu of radish; Sun Kuixiu, who created a method for removing insects from fruit trees; Ma Fayun, who created and reformed 63 kinds of tools; Sun Zhaowen, an excellent salesperson who has been praised by customers many times; Chai Erfuyin, a pest control model of Shaleng People's Commune, Shuoxian, Shanxi; and Li Guihua, an outstanding young person in Guangzhou's Dongshan canteen, who devoted himself wholeheartedly to his work, was not concerned with reward and was praised for his excellent service.

After joining the League, these new members were greatly encouraged politically and are participating in socialist construction with greater revolutionary vigor. Li Wenqing, a cotton worker at Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3, improved her operating techniques, reducing the unevenness of the cotton roll to 0.31. After joining the League, she actively worked with everyone to reduce the unevenness of the cotton roll to 0.22. At the beginning of this year, the impurity content of the cotton roll was reduced from more than 1% to 0.75%, the return rate of the roll was reduced from 3% to 1.5%, and the amount of cotton produced per shift was increased from 1,500 kg to 3,000 kg. In some areas where the organizational foundation of the League was originally weak, the strengthening of the League's organization has enabled the League's organization to play a greater role in this year's even greater leap forward.

Currently, League organizations at all levels are using various forms to strengthen the education of new members in socialism, communism, and basic knowledge of the League, in order to further improve their political awareness. (Attached picture)

    社会主义建设突击手越来越多
    全国共青团员达二千五百万
    新华社2日讯　全国青年运动的核心——中国共产主义青年团组织，在党的领导下，经过整风运动、反右派斗争和一九五八年全国大跃进，获得了进一步巩固和发展。目前，全国已有二千五百万共青团员，一百多万个共青团支部。
    去冬今春以来，各地共青团组织共接受新团员二百多万人。这些新团员都是经过党、团组织较长时间教育和培养，从大跃进中涌现出来的各行各业的青年积极分子。他们大多数是工农出身，立场坚定，政治觉悟高，能联系群众。据河南九个县调查，在一万八千四百二十五名新团员中，贫农、下中农出身的占新团员总数的88.7％，又据广东雷北、汕头市郊区和部分公社的七千一百三十六名新团员的统计，其中工人、贫农、下中农出身的占95.6％。各地党委对共青团组织的巩固和发展极为重视。这是团的组织发展工作得以顺利进行的基本保证。
    在这些新团员中女团员占30％以上。这说明我国的女青年在社会主义建设中正在发挥越来越大的作用。尤其是在农村，由于人民公社的建立，使广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，有机会为社会主义建设作出更多的贡献。在各个少数民族中，也有许多优秀青年加入共青团组织。
    在这批新发展的团员中，有许多是先进生产者、工农业劳动模范、技术革新能手和青年社会主义建设积极分子。柳州市新发展的四百六十四名新团员中，各种模范人物占64.22％；湛江市接收的新团员中有69.3％是被评为功臣或受到表扬的。新团员中有一连受到七次奖励的插秧、耙田能手、炼钢积极分子、韶关市郊樟市公社青年生产模范陈朝光，有“钢铁青年红色突击手”、上海市青年社会主义建设积极分子徐麟龙，他是上钢六厂转炉车间青年班浇钢部艺徒，由于他热爱工作，虚心学习，在短短的三、四个月中就掌握了较复杂的浇钢技术，并配合师傅培养出两个操作熟练的浇钢工。扫盲积极分子、太原市北城区缉虎营街扫盲义务教员金芝兰；山东省创造黄烟亩产七千三百零三斤、萝卜亩产四万斤的张亭英，创造果树根外除虫法的孙奎修，创造和改革六十三种工具的马发运，多次受到顾客表扬的优秀营业员的孙兆文；山西朔县沙楞人民公社除四害模范柴二福银；埋头苦干、不计报酬，服务态度好，获得顾客赞扬的广州市东山食堂一等先进工作者李桂华等优秀青年，都光荣地参加了共青团。
    这批新团员入团后，在政治上受到很大鼓舞，正在以更大的革命干劲参加社会主义建设。郑州国棉三厂和花工李文庆，曾经改进操作技术，使棉卷不匀率降低到零点三一，入团后她又积极和大家一起，把棉卷不匀率又降低到零点二二。今年初，棉卷含杂率又由原来1％以上降低到0.75％，退卷率由3％降低到1.5％，并由每班和花一千五百公斤提高到三千公斤。一些团的组织基础原来较薄弱的地区，壮大了团的组织以后，这就使团的组织能够在今年的更大的跃进中，发挥更大的作用。
    当前各地团组织，正在运用多种形式，加强对新团员进行社会主义、共产主义以及团的基本知识的教育，进一步提高他们的政治觉悟。（附图片）
