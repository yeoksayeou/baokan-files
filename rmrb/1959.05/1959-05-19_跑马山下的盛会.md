    A Grand Gathering Under Paoma Mountain
    By Xinhua News Agency reporters Li Desen and Yu Jingqi
    On May 15th, beneath Paoma Mountain on the western outskirts of Kangding, a variety of tents were set up in a poplar grove. Early in the morning, over ten thousand Tibetan and Han people, dressed in festive attire, young and old, came to enjoy themselves. In the shady hills and forests, people gathered to picnic, play musical instruments, and drink wine. At night, bonfires blazed, and the soaring Tibetan folk songs and the flowing sleeves of the string dances rose and fell in waves. Kangding's annual three-day circumambulation festival had begun.
    The circumambulation festival originated to commemorate the birth of Sakyamuni. Legend has it that the festival has existed since the founding of Kangding, with a history of over a thousand years. This year, the two Lama temples, the Vajra Temple and the Namo Temple, located under Paoma Mountain, still opened all their scripture halls and Buddha halls as usual, allowing people to pay their respects and worship. Inside the temples, pine smoke swirled, prayer flags hung high, and people came and went in an endless stream.
    Because the democratic reform has been thoroughly completed here and a bumper harvest was achieved last year, this year's circumambulation festival is especially lively. On the open spaces inside the temples and in the surrounding forests, various drama, dance, and music performances attracted many visitors. The Kangding amateur song and dance troupe, composed of more than twenty Tibetan workers and farmers, performed their newly choreographed song and dance program "Tell Chairman Mao About Happiness." Five Tibetan girls and five young men, with colorful sleeves fluttering, danced lightly to the clear rhythm of the string music. They sang as they danced: "Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the great saviors of Tibetan people on the plateau, democratic reform divides the land, factories and farms are established everywhere, Tibetan people are endlessly happy, we want to tell you in detail about our happy life..." Several thousand people crowded around the stage to watch this wonderful performance, because this program expressed the visitors' feelings.
    In the midst of the lively local dances, we met Zeyang, the deputy director of the Kangding suburban People's Democratic Agricultural Cooperative. She told us that the entire cooperative had a day off today, and the members had all come here to have fun. To make the fun even more enjoyable, the cooperative's club arranged songs and dances, and the members brought milk cakes, butter tea, dried meat, candy, and other kinds of food for the picnic. Zeyang said, "Many members are experiencing such a joyful day here for the first time in their lives." She told us with deep emotion that among the fifty-plus households in the People's Democratic Agricultural Cooperative, more than forty households used to lack food and clothing. Under the cruel exploitation of the feudal lords, their annual income was only enough to eat for two or three months, and they had to rely on digging wild vegetables and begging for the rest of the year. In previous years, on this day, the poor peasants could only stand on the mountain and look at the lively scene here. After the democratic reform, the peasants were given land and established cooperatives. A bumper harvest was achieved last year, and the grain yield of one niu gongdi (approximately two mu) increased from over two hundred catties to over five hundred catties. Sideline occupations were also developed, and the income of the members increased several times.
    Next to a flower-decorated tent, we met a Tibetan girl wearing a brown serge Tibetan-style long robe and a red silk "Xianzi" shirt, with her sleeves rolled up high. Her name was Jiangcuo, and she was a production team leader in the Chaomei Agricultural Cooperative of Kangding County. She and several relatives and friends set up a tent on the lawn to celebrate the circumambulation festival. She had just returned from watching the songs and dances and was preparing to eat some "Zhexima Ke" (butter rice), which in the past only feudal lords could afford to eat. This girl told us that their cooperative had already established a canteen. Last year, her family of five received 245 yuan in addition to food. The whole family made new clothes and also deposited 100 yuan in the bank. Jiangcuo's family was very poor before the democratic reform. In order to pay heavy rent and taxes to the feudal lords, she had to go to the mountains to collect firewood from a young age and often drove yaks to travel to other places. She said: In the past, I had no mood to visit the circumambulation festival. This year, I want to have a good time.
    Quebi, the director of the Zhumula Pastoral Cooperative in Litang County, was sitting on the grass drinking tea with several women from the pastoral area who had silver bowls tied to their braids. They had just returned from a visit to the interior and were enthusiastically discussing the cooperative's production this year. We asked Quebi about the situation of the pasture, and he told us that the cattle were fat and the horses were strong this year, the water and grass were abundant, and the people on the pasture were also celebrating the "Shuabazi" festival.
    It is now the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar. April, in Tibetan, is called "Saga Dawa," which means the month when all things grow. In this month, there are especially many festivals and folk entertainment activities on the plateau. This year, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has completed the democratic reform, Tibetan farmers and herdsmen have gained freedom and happiness, and various festival activities in various places are richer and more colorful than in previous years.

    跑马山下的盛会
    新华社记者　李德森　于竞祁
    5月15日，康定西郊跑马山下对面的一片白杨林里，搭起了各色帐篷。大清早，一万多穿着节日盛装的藏、汉族人民，扶老携幼来到这里尽情玩乐。在浓荫蔽天的山坡树林里，人们围坐野餐，弹琴饮酒。入夜，篝火熊熊，高亢的藏族民歌和长袖翩翩的弦子舞，此起彼伏。康定一年一度为期三天的转山会开始了。
    转山会的由来，是为了纪念释迦牟尼诞生。相传从康定建城开始就有了转山会，距今已有一千多年历史了。今年，跑马山下的金刚寺和南无寺两座喇嘛寺庙，还是按照过去的惯例，所有经堂佛殿都一齐开放，任人瞻仰朝拜。寺庙内松烟缭绕，经幡高挂，人来人往，络绎不绝。
    由于这里已经彻底完成了民主改革，去年又获得了大丰收，所以今年的转山会特别热闹。在寺庙内的空场上和寺庙周围的树林里，各种戏剧、舞蹈、音乐表演吸引了众多的游人。由二十多个藏族工人、农民组成的康定业余歌舞队，演出了他们特地新排的歌舞节目“把幸福告诉毛主席”，五个藏族姑娘和五个青年男子，彩袖飘飘，蹈着节奏清晰的弦子节拍，轻盈起舞。他们边舞边唱道：“共产党，毛主席，高原藏民大救星，民主改革分田地，工厂农庄到处建立起，藏民乐无尽，要把幸福生活细细告诉你……”。好几千人挤在舞台周围，观看了这出精彩演出，因为这个节目道出了游人的心意。
    在热闹的土舞丛中，我们碰见了康定城郊民改农业社副社长泽央，她告诉我们，今天全社放假一天，社员们都到这里游玩来了，为了玩个痛快，社的俱乐部编排了歌舞，社员们带来了奶饼、酥油、干肉、糖果等各式各样的食品供野宴用。泽央说：“如此欢乐地来这里耍一天，许多社员还是生平第一次。”她异常感慨地告诉我们，民改农业社五十多户社员中，过去就有四十多户少衣缺食，在封建主的残酷压榨下，一年的收入只够吃两三个月，其余的日子就全靠挖野菜和乞讨来过活。往年这一天，贫苦农民们对这里的热闹情景，只能站在山头上望望。民主改革以后，农民们分得了土地，建立了合作社，去年获得大丰收，一个牛工地（约二亩）的粮食产量由二百多斤增加到五百多斤，副业也搞起来了，社员的收入增加了几倍。
    在一座镶花帐篷旁边，我们认识了一位藏族姑娘，她身穿棕色哔叽藏式长衫，红绸的“仙兹”衬衫，袖口高高挽起。她名叫降错，是康定县超美农业社的一个生产队长。她和几家亲戚朋友在草坪上搭起帐篷，欢度这次转山会。她刚刚看完歌舞回来，准备吃上一点过去只有封建主们才能吃到的“哲西玛克”（酥油米饭）。这位姑娘告诉我们，她们社里已经办了食堂，她全家五口人去年除了伙食外，还分得二百四十五元，全家都制了新衣，还存了一百元在银行里。降错的家庭在民主改革以前非常穷困，为了向封建主缴纳沉重的租税，她从小就上山打柴，并经常赶牦牛奔走他乡。她说：过去那有心思来逛转山会，今年要痛快耍一天。
    理塘县珠木拉牧业社的社长却比，同几个发辫上系着银碗的牧区妇女在草地上围坐饮茶。她们刚从内地参观回来，兴致勃勃地谈论着今年社里的生产。我们向却比问起牧场的情况，他告诉我们说，今年牛肥马壮，水草丰美，牧场上的人也正在欢度“耍坝子”的节日。
    现在正是藏历4月。4月，藏语叫做
  “萨噶道哇”，意思是万物丛生的月份。在这个月里，高原上的各种节日和民间娱乐活动特别多。今年，甘孜藏族自治州已经完成民主改革，藏族农牧民得到了自由和幸福，各地的各种节日活动也都比往年更丰富多采。
