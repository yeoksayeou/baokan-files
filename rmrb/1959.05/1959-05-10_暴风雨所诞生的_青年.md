    This year marks the 55th anniversary of the birth of the Soviet writer Nikolai Ostrovsky, and it is very meaningful to screen the film "The Youth Born of the Storm," which is based on his work.
    Although Ostrovsky passed away at the young age of thirty-two, he left behind not only many essays and letters but also two novels worthy of being called masterpieces of Soviet literature: "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "The Youth Born of the Storm." The latter is an unfinished work; Ostrovsky completed the first part in 1936, and a few days later, he passed away.
    In the early 1930s, fascists were rampant internationally, threatening human civilization. The author used the situation after the end of World War I, when Polish fascist troops took advantage of the German army's retreat to attempt to occupy western Ukraine and ravage the local people. The Bolsheviks led the Ukrainian working class in a heroic struggle, and a new generation of revolutionaries was born in the storm. Thus, he called this work an "anti-fascist political novel." We know that Ostrovsky was born in Volhynia Province (now Rivne Province) in Ukraine and experienced the difficult years of German and Polish occupation of this area. From that time on, he participated in the Party's underground work. Ostrovsky wrote "The Youth Born of the Storm," writing about the struggle during the Polish occupation of Volhynia, precisely writing about the things he experienced and was most familiar with.
    The film adapted from the novel is a perfect work, showing how the younger generation is tempered by the revolutionary war and grows stronger.
    From the very beginning, the film depicts the struggle along two lines: how an old Bolshevik worker leads his son to participate in the revolution, and how a father and son from an aristocratic landlord family organize Polish fascist troops and collude with the German army to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Between these two main lines that run through the entire film, the screenwriter and director very cleverly present another line. At first glance, it does not seem to be a line that develops the drama, at least not the main line, but the audience is increasingly attracted to this line. The captivating drama of "The Youth Born of the Storm" unfolds from here.
    A large part of the film has already been shown, and we see a young man named Andrei walking out of a hotel with an accordion in hand. He sings a boring love song, he is pleased with his new leather boots, and what dominates his thoughts is love. He staggers drunkenly, indifferent to the great changes that have already taken place around him, the Polish army occupying his hometown, and the resistance to the Red Army coming to liberate it. Instead, he stumbles along to find the girl he is pursuing. …
    Seeing such a young man, we cannot help but worry about his fate. In such a sharp struggle, it is possible to run to the enemy's side and harm the revolution, or to muddle through life in a daze. The development of the drama seems to prove this point. His almost absurd love affair is hindering the secret activities of the revolutionaries.
    However, the further development of the play is that this seemingly insignificant young man plays the most outstanding role in the revolutionary struggle. He risks his life to rush into the boiler room to sound the siren, calling on the factory workers and their families to rise up and fight. Later, he also fought most bravely in the struggle against the Polish fascist troops.
    What is valuable is that the author writes without any coercion about how Andrei embarked on the revolutionary road: first, he is a worker, born into a working-class family; second, he lost both his parents but received the kind care and guidance of an old worker, Uncle Dallas. The shooting of this old worker awakened him and made him realize that he must avenge his uncle against the enemy.
    The film grasps the characteristics of the early days of the October Revolution, depicting the innocence and naivety of the young people, their revolutionary enthusiasm, but often making mistakes due to ignorance: rushing to the noble's house to "kill the family" without organization or discipline; becoming complacent after initial success, and even dancing with the captured countess without any principle; falling asleep when tired of dancing, almost leading to total annihilation.
    The two scenes of "cleverly sounding the siren" and "encountering danger while killing the family" are extremely tense and moving. The story is well arranged, the acting is good, and through the depiction of such dramatic and thrilling scenes, through the heroic and arduous struggle of the older generation leading the new generation of revolutionaries, we see how the youth are born in the storm, and how the youth born in the storm set off a storm in the revolutionary struggle.

　　“暴风雨所诞生的”青年
　　林陵
    今年是苏联作家奥斯特洛夫斯基诞生五十五周年，放映根据他的作品“暴风雨所诞生的”拍摄的影片，是很有意义的。
    奥斯特洛夫斯基虽然在三十二岁的盛年就已去世，但他除了留下不少论文和书信，还留下两部值得称为苏联文学巨著的长篇小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”和“暴风雨所诞生的”。后者是一部未完成的作品，奥斯特洛夫斯基在1936年完成了第一部分之后，不几天，他便与世长辞了。
    在三十年代初，国际上正是法西斯主义者开始横行，威胁着人类文明的时候。作者取世界大战结束后，波兰法西斯式的军队趁德军败退之时，企图占领乌克兰西部，蹂躏当地人民，布尔什维克领导乌克兰工人阶级进行英勇斗争，年轻的一代革命者在暴风雨中诞生的情况为题材，以此进行反法西斯斗争。所以作者把这部作品称为“反法西斯的政治小说”。我们知道，奥斯特洛夫斯基生在乌克兰的沃里尼省（现名罗文斯克省），曾经历德军和波军占领这个地区的艰难岁月，并且从那时起，他就参加党的地下工作了。奥斯特洛夫斯基写“暴风雨所诞生的”，写沃里尼波军占领时期的斗争，正是写他所经历的最熟悉的事情。
    根据小说改编的电影，是一部完美的作品，可以看到青年一代受到革命战火的洗礼，如何成长壮大起来。
    影片一开始就分两条线来描写当时的斗争：一个布尔什维克老工人怎样带他的儿子参加革命；一个贵族地主家庭的父子怎样组织波兰法西斯军队和德军勾结，进行反革命活动。在贯串着全部影片的这两条主线之间，编剧和导演非常巧妙地又展现出另一条线，初看起来，似乎这不是一条发展戏剧的线，至少不是主要的线，但观众却愈来愈被这一条线所吸引。“暴风雨所诞生的”引人入胜的好戏，就从这里展开了。
    影片已经放了一大段，我们看见一个青年安得烈拉着手风琴从酒店里走出来，他唱的是无聊的恋歌，他洋洋得意的是他脚上的一双新皮靴，支配他思想的是恋爱，他蹒跚着酒醉的步子，对于周围已经发生的波兰军占领他的家乡，抗拒红军前来解放的大变革，他却漠不关心，而是踉踉跄跄地走去寻找他所追求的姑娘。……
    我们看到这样的青年，不禁为他的命运担心。在斗争如此尖锐的时候，有可能跑到敌人方面去危害革命，或者糊里糊涂地混日子。戏剧的发展，似乎也证明了这一点。他那种迹近胡闹的恋爱，在妨碍着革命者的秘密活动。
    但是戏的进一步发展，正是这个似乎无所谓的青年，起了最杰出的革命战斗的作用，他冒着生命危险，冲到锅炉间去放汽笛，号召全厂工人和他们的家属起来斗争。后来他参加对波兰法西斯军队的斗争，也最为英勇。
    可贵的是作者毫不勉强地写出了安得烈所以走上革命道路的经过：首先，他是工人，他出身于工人家庭；其次，他父母双亡，但受到一位老工人——达拉斯叔叔的亲切照顾和教导。这个老工人的被枪杀，使他觉悟起来，认清了敌人要为叔叔报仇。
    影片抓紧十月革命初期的特点，描写青年们的天真幼稚，有革命热情，但常犯由于无知而造成的错误：无组织无纪律地冲到贵族家里去“杀家”；取得初步成功，又麻痹大意起来，甚至毫无立场地同被俘的伯爵夫人跳舞；跳倦了打瞌睡，几乎全军复灭。
    “巧放汽笛”和“杀家遇险”两场戏，极为紧张动人，故事安排得好，戏演得好，通过这种戏剧性的惊险场面的描绘，通过老一代带领新一代革命者的英勇艰苦的斗争，看到了青年怎样从暴风雨中诞生，暴风雨所诞生的青年又怎样掀起革命斗争中的暴风雨。
