Beware of "Nostalgia for the Past"
Speech by Committee Member Wang Boxiang

Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," my overall feeling is that it is broad, profound, and all-encompassing. This report provides detailed and clear instructions on the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, on all measures for construction in the political, economic, cultural, educational, and scientific fields, and on the analysis of the domestic and international situation, etc. In particular, it provides multifaceted concern for the transformation of intellectuals and points out the path of transformation. I am excited and inspired, and wholeheartedly support it. Subsequently, I listened to Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft 1959 National Economic Plan" and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the Draft 1959 National Budget," and then successively listened to the two "Work Reports" by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Vice Chairman Li Weihan, which more specifically summarized the past achievements and pointed out the direction for the future. As the People's Daily headline in a news report on the 20th of this month stated, it is "an epic summarizing the Great Leap Forward, inspiring the clarion call for another leap forward." I wholeheartedly support them all.

I recently had the opportunity to return to my native province to visit, and I saw a series of water conservancy projects in the Hongze Lake, Huai River, and Grand Canal systems, industrial construction and agricultural measures in various places, two distinctive people's communes—one is the urban commune of Nantong City (Red Flag Commune), and the other is the water-based commune of Zhenze County (Taihu Commune), as well as schools, hospitals, etc. Everywhere displays a scene of rapid progress, marching in unison under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction, implementing the policy of walking on two legs, and embodying the spirit of the whole country as a single chessboard. In recent days, I have also listened to the enthusiastic discussions of the committee members in our group meetings, elaborating and introducing the achievements in various fields. The situation I have seen and heard during my visits can be closely corroborated everywhere, making me even more excited, almost indescribable.

Now, I would like to briefly talk about my personal aspirations in connection with my own work. I am engaged in the study of Chinese history and ancient Chinese literature. What I come into contact with are mostly old accounts. Although I usually use Du Fu's famous saying "Not belittling people today, loving people of old" to encourage myself in my attitude towards these books, always wanting to embrace everything and choose the good to follow, in the course of my work, I am often tempted by the splendid historical relics and the wealth of data, and I cannot help but overly appreciate them, unconsciously falling into a predicament. Although I am confident that I would not openly commit the offense of "belittling the present," the "nostalgia for the past" often accompanies it, which is such a dangerous thing! Now that I have received such a great inspiration from the present, I deeply wish to remind myself at all times, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and, under the leadership of the Party, move towards a new path together with my research colleagues. I ask myself to thoroughly understand the object of research, completely discard those tedious and corrupt dregs, and excavate some things that are in line with the democratic spirit and can still be used to serve the broad masses of the people today. Let these excavated things be combined with the new things of the present, and under the principle of putting politics in command, use them carefully. Strive to ensure that the spirit of walking on two legs is also implemented in the stacks of old papers, and that the role of "making the past serve the present" is brought into play, honestly serving the people.

Finally, in order to keep the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland intact, I warmly support the State Council's order to dissolve the former local government of Tibet and completely quell the Tibetan rebellion, and I support the speech of the Panchen Erdeni; moreover, we must liberate Taiwan.

### 警惕“思古之幽情”  王伯祥委员的发言

　　警惕“思古之幽情”
    王伯祥委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了周总理的“政府工作报告”，有一个总的感觉，就是博大精深，无所不包。这一报告，对于工业、农业生产的大跃进，对于政治、经济、文教、科学各方面建设的一切措施，对于国内外形势的分析，等等，都作了详尽而明确的指示；尤其对于知识分子的改造，作了多方的关顾，并且指出了改造的途径。我兴奋鼓舞，衷心拥护。接着又听到了李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，又先后听了彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的两个“工作报告”更具体地总结了已往的成绩，指出了今后的方向，正如本月二十日人民日报在一条新闻报道的标题所说，是“总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角”。我都竭诚拥护。
    我此次有机会回到我出生的本省去参观，看到了洪泽湖、淮河、运河系统的一系列的水利建设，各地的工业建设和农业措施，两个具有特点的人民公社——一个是南通市的城市公社（红旗公社），一个是震泽县的水上公社（太湖公社），以及学校、医院等等。随时随地都显示着突飞猛进的景象，步调一致地在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，体现了全国一盘棋的精神。连日以来，又在本组的小组会上听了诸位委员的热烈讨论，阐述和介绍了各方面的成绩。跟我在参观中所见所闻的情形处处可以得到密合的印证，使我更加兴奋，几乎难以形容。
    现在，我想结合我自己的工作，简单说一说我个人的愿望。我是搞中国历史的，同时又在搞中国的古代文学。接触到的大都是些陈本旧账。平时对待这些书本的态度，虽然常用杜甫的那句“不薄今人爱古人”的名言来策励自己，总想兼收并蓄，择善而从。可是在工作进行的当中，往往为灿烂的历史文物和丰富的大堆资料所诱惑，不免过度地欣赏它，不自觉地陷入了困境。固然“薄今”两字自信还不致于公然干犯，而“思古之幽情”却也往往相伴而发，这是多么危险的事！我今受到当前的这样伟大的启示，我深愿随时提醒自己，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，在党的领导之下，跟研究的同志们一道，趋向新的道路。要求自己好好地摸清研究的对象，把那些烦琐的、陈腐的糟粕彻底地抛弃掉；把一些合乎民主精神的，在今天仍旧可以用来为广大人民服务的东西，挖掘出来。让这些挖掘出来的东西与当前的新事物相结合，在政治挂帅的原则下，慎择使用。务使两条腿走路的精神也贯彻到故纸堆中去，发挥“古为今用”的作用，老实地为人民服务。
    最后，为祖国的美丽山河保持全瓯无缺，我热烈拥护国务院解散原西藏地方政府，彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令，拥护班禅额尔德尼的发言；而且一定要解放台湾。
