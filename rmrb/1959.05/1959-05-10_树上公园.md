　　Tree-top Park

　　Jinping, Yunnan, is one of China's main subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest areas. Because the mountainous area here is often cloudy and foggy, rich mosses, ferns, and orchid plants are epiphytic on every tree trunk. People who come to this forest area can see large trees that take several people to encircle. On one of its branches, a maple tree with a diameter of about twenty centimeters has grown. On the branches of the maple tree, *Litsea cubeba*, which is blooming with yellow flowers, has grown. Other branches of the large tree are also covered with various shrubs, vines, herbs, mosses and other epiphytic plants, blooming with various colors of beautiful large and small flowers, covered with all kinds of differently shaped leaves, looking like a tree-top park. Tree-top parks like this can be seen everywhere in the Jinping forest area, forming a spectacle of the subtropical forest.

　　树上公园
    云南金平是我国主要的亚热带常绿阔叶林区之一。由于这里山区多云雾，在每株树干上都附生着丰富的苔藓、蕨类及兰科植物。来到这个林区的人，可以看到几人合围的大树，在它的一个树枝上，又生长了直径约二十公分的槭树，槭树的枝干上又长了正在开着黄花的木姜子。大树的其它枝干上也都长满了各种各样的灌木、藤本、草本、苔藓等附生植物，开着各种颜色美丽的大大小小花朵，布满了形形色色的叶片，看起来就像一个树上公园。像这样的树上公园在金平林区到处可见，形成了亚热带森林的奇观。
