Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd. Today, at the Second Congress of Advanced Units and Activists in Logistics Work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, seven hundred and eighty-eight advanced units and activists were commended and rewarded. They are the new heroes and models that have emerged on the logistics front in the era of the Great Leap Forward. With their unwavering loyalty to the Party, they have created extraordinary achievements in ordinary positions and have set a shining example for the people with their noble moral character.

Among the medical warriors, the two hundred and fifty-three representatives all shone with the light of lofty revolutionary humanitarianism. Assistant military doctor Li Changfa, who had just returned from the Tibetan pacification troops, was wounded in the head during a battle to pursue and annihilate bandits. However, throughout the battle, he never left the front line and continued to carry out his mission. In the wards, doctors and nurses devote great efforts to the health of the wounded and sick. Nurse Fu Xiangwu, for ten years, has never been absent, late, or left early, and has never had a medical accident, truly taking "the ward as home."

At the meeting, many logistics personnel were commended and respected for their meritorious service in cooking, raising pigs, repairing shoes, washing clothes, and other work. Cook Squad Leader Wu Kun has been a cook since 1946. For thirteen years, whether in wartime or peacetime, he has always tried his best to ensure that everyone eats well, eats their fill, and is satisfied. Once, a tuberculosis patient wanted to eat fish, but it was not available in the market. When he found out, he used his rest time to catch fish in the river to satisfy the patient's wish. Shoemaker Cai Wenyu has been in the army since 1946, cooking, raising pigs, repairing shoes, cutting hair, and washing clothes. He cheerfully does whatever the superiors ask him to do, and he does it well. Originally, he had not learned how to repair rubber shoes or replace soles. After the superiors asked him to be a shoemaker, he did not flinch and ran around, looking for shoe stores and shoe repair stalls to learn the trade. In less than half a year, he was able to skillfully repair all kinds of shoes, carrying a small box over mountains and ridges, from one company to another. Yang Mao is a laundry worker at a hospital of the Fujian front-line troops. She is fifty years old this year, but she is full of energy. She washes an average of more than 110 pieces of bedding and sick clothes every day, and she washes them clean and folds them neatly, never delaying replacement. One spring night last year, she got up automatically to wipe the glass in the corridor and fell from a ladder. Before she had recovered from her hospitalization, she asked to work, even shouting in her dreams: "The clothes of the wounded and sick are waiting for me to wash!"

A large number of outstanding drivers have emerged on the long transport lines of the motherland. They do not avoid bullets on the front lines, and they disregard wind, snow, and high mountains in the plateau areas, delivering supplies to the soldiers. Hero driver Zhu Longshan, once, while performing a mission in the Altai region at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, the temperature suddenly dropped below minus thirty degrees Celsius. The cold wind was biting, and the snow was pervasive. In some places, it was simply impossible to pass. He and his assistant used shovels and pickaxes to open the road as they moved forward. In this uninhabited area, they fought for three days and three nights, finally delivering the supplies to the troops. While completing transport tasks, they also cherished their vehicles as their lives and valued oil as their blood. The Second Platoon of the Fifth Company of a certain automobile regiment, which has been driving on the Kangzang, Riya, and La’a highways for years, has overcome countless snow-capped mountains, glaciers, quicksand, and mud, and has driven safely for 1.03 million kilometers in eight years. The Fourth Company of a certain automobile regiment has also saved a total of 160,000 yuan in gasoline and various materials in six years of safe driving, covering more than 3.83 million kilometers.

Here, there are also forty-seven representatives from military supply factories, who work day and night to make well-fitting clothes and lightweight and practical shoes and socks for the soldiers. Like their brother factories across the country, they have launched a high-yield, high-quality, increase-production, and conserve-resources campaign centered on technological innovation. Adhesive shoe worker Tang Jufen constantly improved operating methods to improve the quality of the peeling force of rubber shoes, creating the national record of 4.54 meters for the peeling force of rubber shoes. Jiu Derong is an selfless worker who has not been absent from work for nine years.

Last year, there were as many as 290,000 inventions and technological innovations on the logistics front. At this conference, dozens of people who had racked their brains to innovate technology to ensure the needs of the troops were rewarded. Laxi (Mongolian), director of the X-ray department of a certain hospital, independently developed and successfully imitated the "horizontal tomography machine," "rotational therapy machine," "cardiac vessel longitudinal tomography wave photography machine," and "cardiac horizontal tomography wave photography machine." Yu Chuan'yin, assistant of the Guangzhou area troops logistics camp management department, successfully designed the "unequal section roof truss," which saves an average of more than 15% of timber compared with the original design. Cook Squad Leader Meng Zhaolun, in order to save coal for cooking, worked hard to study and, after more than sixty experiments, successfully created the "double-eye back-air stove," which greatly reduced coal consumption for cooking.

In the ranks of logistics heroes, there are also many people who do housing management, ordnance, finance, warehousing, and station work. They have always been diligent and conscientious, working hard and without complaint, serving the vast number of soldiers. When houses are damaged, they come to repair them; when weapons malfunction, they rush to repair them; when it comes time to issue allowances and salaries, they deliver them; when traveling in uninhabited plateaus, they are responsible for preparing food and lodging. Today, these extraordinary people in ordinary positions will carry the encouragement and strength given to them by the Party and superiors, and will make greater achievements with greater enthusiasm.

    后勤战线英雄辈出
    七百多先进单位和个人受奖
    新华社23日讯　今天，中国人民解放军第二次后勤工作先进单位和积极分子代表会议上，七百八十八个先进单位和积极分子受到了表扬和奖励。他们是大跃进年代里，后勤战线上涌现出来的新英雄，新标兵，他们以对党的赤胆忠心，在平凡的岗位上创造出不平凡的事迹，以高尚的道德品质，为人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    在白衣战士当中，二百五十三名代表的身上都闪耀着崇高的革命人道主义的光辉。刚从西藏平叛部队归来的助理军医李昌法，在一次追歼叛匪的战斗中，头部负了伤。但他在整个战斗中，始终没有离开火线，继续执行任务。在病房里，医生和护士为了伤病员的健康付出巨大的辛劳。护士富祥武，十年如一日，从来没有缺勤、迟到或早退，也没有发生过一次医疗事故，真正是以“病房为家”。
    在会上，有不少后勤工作人员，他们在做饭、养猪、补鞋、洗衣服等工作中立了功，受到人们尊敬。炊事班长吴坤，从1946年起就当了炊事员。十三年来他不论在战斗年代或和平时期，都是千方百计地让大家吃得好，吃得饱，吃得满意。有一次，有个结核病人想吃鱼，市场上买不到，他知道以后就用休息时间到河里去捕鱼，来满足病人的愿望。鞋工蔡稳玉，从1946年入伍以来，做饭、养猪、补鞋、理发、洗衣服，上级叫他干什么他就愉快地去干什么，而且都干得很好。本来他对补胶鞋、换鞋底等没有学过。上级叫他当鞋工以后，他毫不退缩地东奔西跑，找皮鞋店、补鞋摊，去拜师学艺，不到半年，他就能熟练地修补各种鞋子了，背着小箱子翻山越岭，从这个连到那个连。杨毛如是福建前线部队某医院洗衣员，今年五十岁了，可是她精神焕发，每天平均要洗一百一十多件卧具病衣，而且洗得干净，叠得整齐，从来不耽误更换。去年春天一个深夜，她自动地起床擦走廊玻璃时，从梯子上摔了下来，住院未愈就要求工作，甚至在梦里都喊着：“伤病员的衣服等着我洗啊！”
    在祖国漫长的运输线上出现了大批的优秀司机，他们在前线不避枪林弹雨，在高原地带不顾风雪高山，把物资源源送到战士的手里。英雄司机朱隆山，有一次在天山脚下阿勒泰地区执行任务时，气温突然降到零下三十度以下，寒风刺骨，风雪弥漫，有些地方简直无法通行，他和他的助手用铁锹、十字镐，一边开路一边前进。在这渺无人烟的地区，搏斗了三天三夜，终于把物资送到部队。他们在完成运输任务的同时，还都是爱车如命，爱油如血。成年累月行驶在康藏、日亚、拉阿等公路上的汽车某团五连二班，八年来战胜了无数的雪山、冰川、流沙、泥泞，安全行车一百零三万公里。汽车某团四连还在安全行车六年，行驶三百八十三万多公里中，节约了汽油和各种材料总值达十六万元。
    这里，还有四十七名军需工厂的代表，他们日夜为战士修制合身的衣服，做轻便适用的鞋袜。他们和全国兄弟工厂一样，开展了以技术革新为中心的高产优质增产节约运动。粘鞋工人汤菊芬不断改进操作方法，提高胶鞋剥离力的质量，创造了全国胶鞋剥离力四点五四公尺的最高纪录。咎德荣是位忘我劳动的工人，他九年没有缺过一次勤。
    后勤战线上去年的发明创造和技术革新达二十九万项之多，这次大会上就有几十个为了保证部队的需要，绞尽脑汁，革新技术的人受到奖励。某医院X光科主任拉西（蒙），自制和仿造成功“水平断层摄影机”、“旋转治疗机”、“心脏血管纵断层记波摄影机”和“心脏水平断层记波摄影机”。广州地区部队后勤营管部助理员余传寅，设计成功“不等节屋架”，比原来设计平均节约木材15％以上。炊事班长孟昭伦，为了省炊事用煤，刻苦钻研，经过六十多次试验，创造成功“双眼回风灶”，使炊事用煤大大减低。
    在后勤英雄的行列里，还有许多做营房管理、军械、财务、仓库、兵站等工作的人，他们一直是勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨，为广大士兵服务。房子坏了他们赶来修补；武器发生故障他们跑来修理；到了发津贴、薪金的时候他们送来了，在无人烟的高原上行走的时候，他们负责准备食宿。今天，这些平凡岗位上不平凡的人，将带着党和上级给他们的鼓励和力量，以更大的干劲作出更大的成绩。
