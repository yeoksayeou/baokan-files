Strengthening Self-Reform and Actively Serving
Speech by Representative Zhou Shutao

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the various reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. This congress is convened under the situation where our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great victories and brilliant accomplishments. Representatives of all nationalities across the country gather together to deliberate on major national plans and bravely advance on the broad road of socialism. I deeply feel that this is a congress of unity and a congress of leaping forward!

The Self-Reform of Industrial and Commercial Figures Must Keep Up with the Leaping Progress of the Motherland

In the past four years, our country's socialist revolution has achieved decisive victories on the economic front and the political-ideological front. The basic completion of the Three Great Transformations has changed the relations of production and promoted the development of productive forces; the victory of the anti-Rightist rectification campaign has enhanced the political consciousness and understanding of the broad masses of people and strengthened the people's democratic dictatorship and unity. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our country's socialist construction has victoriously completed and overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, laying a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization. In 1958, the people of the whole country, especially the broad masses of working people, rose up like a tidal wave, overturning the world and ushering in an unprecedented high tide of the Great Leap Forward. The total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 65 percent compared with 1957, and the output of pig iron, steel, coal, power generation equipment, locomotives, automobiles, power machinery, and agricultural products such as grain and cotton increased by more than double compared with 1957. It can be said that in just one year, we have crossed the road that the old era took decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years to traverse. This speed has never been seen in our history and is simply impossible in capitalist countries. In just a few years, we will catch up with and far surpass those so-called most developed old capitalist countries. We have achieved such great achievements in such a short period of time, which fully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the unparalleled correctness of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism." Ultimately, it is due to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. It is precisely under the leadership of the Party, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, that all positive forces have been mobilized, soaring enthusiasm has been brought into play, one victory has followed another, and brilliant light has been radiated!

The 1959 National Economic Plan, centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, is a more ambitious and feasible plan, a plan for a greater, better, and more comprehensive continued leap forward based on the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The total output value of industry and agriculture will reach 287 billion yuan, and the output of industrial products such as power generation equipment will increase by multiples, even several times. Among the basic construction investments, there are 1,092 projects above the designated limit that will be constructed this year. Such an ambitious plan not only shows the magnificent picture of our country's socialist construction but also embodies the aspirations of the people of the whole country to realize a continued Great Leap Forward. We feel very proud of our existing achievements and are full of infinite confidence in the future prosperity. Premier Zhou's report is a heroic poem and also a solemn call. Completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan is our main task this year. Of course, realizing the 1959 plan is a arduous task. However, through the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we have also acquired many favorable conditions for realizing this plan. We have not only accumulated a stronger material and technical foundation and rich construction experience, but more importantly, the people of the whole country have further recognized the correctness and greatness of the Party's general line for socialist construction, boosting greater confidence and soaring enthusiasm. Under the banner of the Party, we are closely united, working together with one heart and one mind, working hard, working practically, and working cleverly. Coupled with the great assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, no difficulty can stop us from achieving victory. We industrialists and businessmen feel very fortunate and glorious in such a great era. We have the confidence and determination to actively participate in the glorious ranks of socialist construction under the leadership of the Party and driven by the broad masses of workers and peasants, strengthen self-reform, actively serve, and, together with the people of the whole country, turn this year's magnificent blueprint into a brilliant reality.

Under the Leadership of the Party and the Help of the Masses, Industrial and Commercial Figures Have Made Certain Contributions in Production and Management, but Their Political Standpoint Has Not Been Completely Resolved, and They Should Continue to Work Hard to Achieve Self-Reform

In the past year, we industrialists and businessmen have received profound education through the great rectification campaign and have improved to varying degrees politically and ideologically. Moreover, under the leadership of the Party and with the help and support of the working masses, many people have shown positive performance in their work, made certain contributions in production and management, and have been encouraged and welcomed by the Party and the working masses. However, because our political standpoint has not been resolved and duality still exists, we often find ourselves alternately enthusiastic and lukewarm, wavering from left to right in our work. Some people admit that they have not reformed well and want to reform themselves first before serving, so they are hesitant and afraid of this and that in their work. Others feel that they have almost completed their reform when they have achieved some minor results or better performance in their work, and that there is no need to reform further, or they want to specialize in business, talking eloquently about business but remaining tight-lipped when it comes to reform. Although these two manifestations appear different on the surface, they are essentially the same and reflect the nature of the class. They are a reflection of a weariness of reform. Under the circumstances where the people of the whole country are vigorously launching a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, the existence of these phenomena will undoubtedly become an obstacle for us industrialists and businessmen to boost our enthusiasm, give full play to our talents, and contribute the greatest strength to socialist construction. At the same time, it also powerfully illustrates that our reform is still a long-term, repeated, and arduous process. Premier Zhou correctly pointed out in his Government Work Report: "It is also incorrect to think that... there is no need to carry out self-reform, or that they must complete thorough reform in a very short period of time, otherwise they cannot work. All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-reform in their long-term work practice." Although Premier Zhou's instructions are aimed at bourgeois intellectuals, they are equally important to us bourgeois elements. This is the Party's greatest concern and expectation for us. We are determined to follow Premier Zhou's instructions, resolutely implement the principle of taking political-ideological reform as the commander, taking labor and practice as the foundation, and taking the enterprise or work post as the base, and combining these three together. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help and support of the working masses, we will actively participate in socialist construction, continuously break down the capitalist standpoint and ideology and establish the socialist standpoint and ideology in work practice, and do everything possible to actively serve in our work posts or enterprises, make achievements, and greet the great tenth anniversary of the founding of our country!

Our Army's Complete Control of the Shannan Region and All Border Defense Key Points in the Northern Himalayas Is a Fatal Blow to the Tibetan Traitor Group

When our country's socialist construction is booming, the imperialists are unwilling and afraid of the brilliant achievements we have made. They do everything possible to collude with domestic reactionaries or rebellious elements to carry out vicious slander and sabotage. The recent rebellion in Tibet is a clear example. The former Tibetan local government and the reactionary group of the upper class colluded with the imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to openly launch an armed rebellion, attempting to create division and restore the imperialist forces of aggression in Tibet. This treasonous crime of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group aroused great anger among the Tibetan monks, laymen, and people of the whole country. Our troops in the Tibet Military Region, with the support of the broad masses of Tibetan monks and laymen, quickly eliminated a large number of bandits and fleeing bandits, and now have victoriously and completely controlled the Shannan region and all border defense key points in the northern Himalayas. This is a fatal blow to the Tibetan traitor group and also a heavy blow to the imperialists and Indian expansionists. However, the imperialists and Indian expansionists, who have always been hostile to the Chinese people, have recently openly used the Tibetan rebellion to blatantly interfere in our internal affairs. Tibet has always been a part of our country's territory, but the imperialists and Indian expansionists slander us as "aggression." Tibetans have always been members of our country's national family, but Indian expansionists and some politicians say: "Tibetans are Tibetans, not Chinese." The traitors we all hate are allowed to enter India and are warmly received. An absurd so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was distributed through Indian diplomats and was said to have been drafted after a long meeting with Indian Prime Minister's envoy Menon. The content of the document reverses black and white, fully exposing the ugly face of the author, an expansionist, and what is even more infuriating is that the Indian Bombay police authorities recently condoned expansionists to openly "demonstrate" in front of our consulate, insulting the image of our great leader Chairman Mao. I warn the Indian expansionists that insulting our leader is insulting our 650 million people, and we strongly protest! We sternly condemn the conspiracy and all provocative acts of the imperialists and Indian expansionists to interfere in our internal affairs. Tibet is an inseparable part of our sacred territory, and we will never allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs, and we will never allow anyone to undermine our territorial integrity and national unity. We adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but any conspiracy to undermine our unity and interfere in our internal affairs will be completely defeated. I firmly support all the measures taken by the government on the Tibet issue. I believe that the Tibetan people will be reborn from now on, gradually get rid of the backward and dark life, unite with all fraternal nationalities in the motherland family, and jointly embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress.

### 加强改造积极服务  周叔弢代表的发言

　　加强改造积极服务
    周叔弢代表的发言
    我完全同意和衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的各项报告。这次大会，是在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业取得了巨大胜利和辉煌成就的形势下召开的。全国各民族的代表，荟萃一堂，共勷国家大计，在社会主义康庄大道上奋勇前进。我深深体会到这是一次团结的大会、跃进的大会！
　　工商业者的自我改造要跟上祖国跃进形势
    四年以来，我国的社会主义革命，在经济战线上，在政治思想战线上，都取得了决定性的胜利。三大改造的基本完成，改变了生产关系，促进了生产力的发展；反右整风的胜利，提高了广大人民的政治觉悟和认识，加强了人民民主专政和团结。我国的社会主义建设，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，胜利地完成了和超额完成了第一个五年计划，为我国社会主义工业化奠定了初步基础。一九五八年，全国人民，尤其是广大劳动人民，排山倒海，翻天复地，掀起了一个史无前例的大跃进高潮。工农业总产值比一九五七年增长百分之六十五，生铁、钢、煤炭、发电设备、机车、汽车、动力机械以及粮、棉等农业产品的产量都比一九五七年增长一倍以上。可以说，我们在短短的一年中，跨过了旧时代几十年、几百年，甚至几千年所走过的路程。这种速度，在我国历史上是从未有过的，在资本主义国家是根本不可能的。我们用不了几年，就会赶上并且远远超过那些所谓最发达的老牌资本主义国家。我们在如此短暂的时间内，取得了如此巨大的成就，充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，和党提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的无比正确。而归根结底，是由于党和毛主席的英明领导。正是在党的领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，调动了一切积极力量，发挥了冲天干劲，一个胜利接着一个胜利，放射出绚烂光芒！
    以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的一九五九年国民经济计划是一个更宏伟而又切实可行的计划，是在一九五八年大跃进胜利基础上更大、更好、更全面的继续跃进的计划。工农业总产值将达到二千八百七十亿元，发电设备等工业产品将成倍地以至几倍地增长。基本建设投资中今年进行建设的限额以上的项目有一千零九十二个。这样一个宏伟的计划，不仅显示了我国社会主义建设的壮丽图景，而且体现了全国人民实现继续大跃进的意愿。我们对于已有的成就感到十分自豪，对于今后的欣欣向荣充满了无限信心。周总理的报告是英雄的诗篇，同时也是庄严的号召。完成和超额完成一九五九年计划是我们今年的主要任务。当然，实现一九五九年计划，任务是艰巨的。但是，通过一九五八年的大跃进，也具备了实现这一计划的许多有利条件。我们不但积累了更强大的物质技术基础，积累了丰富的建设经验，更重要的是，全国人民进一步认识到党的社会主义建设总路线的正确和伟大，鼓舞了更大的信心和冲天干劲，在党的旗帜下，紧密团结起来，戮力同心，苦干实干巧干。再加上苏联和各兄弟国家的伟大帮助，任何困难都不能阻挡我们 取得胜利。我们工商业者，在这样伟大的时代里，感到十分幸运和光荣，我们有信心有决心，在党的领导下，在工农广大劳动人民的带动下，积极参加到社会主义建设的光荣行列中，加强改造，积极服务，和全国人民一道，把今年的宏伟图景变成辉煌的现实。
    在党的领导和群众的帮助下，工商业者在生产经营上有了一定贡献，但政治立场还没有彻底解决，应当继续努力实现自我改造
　　去年一年来，我们工商业者，通过了伟大的整风运动，受到了深刻的教育，在政治上思想上都有不同程度的提高。而且在党的领导和工人群众的帮助支持下，不少人在工作中有了积极表现，在生产经营上作出了一定贡献，受到了党和工人群众的鼓励和欢迎。但是，由于我们的政治立场还没有得到解决，两面性依然存在，我们在工作中往往时冷时热，左右摇摆，有些人承认自己没有改造好，想先把自己改造好了再来服务，在工作中缩手缩脚，怕这怕那。另有不少人在工作中有了些微成绩或较好的表现，就认为差不多了，用不着再改造了，或者想专搞业务，谈业务时振振有词，谈改造时三缄其口。这两种表现，表面上虽然不同，实质上是相同的，都是阶级本质的反映。是厌倦改造情绪的反映。在全国人民轰轰烈烈地展开更大、更好、更全面的跃进的情况下，这些现象的存在，无疑地将成为我们工商业者鼓起干劲，发挥才能，为社会主义建设贡献最大力量的障碍。同时，也有力地说明了我们的改造仍是一个长期的、反复的、艰巨的过程。周总理在政府工作报告中正确地指出：“以为……已经不需要再进行自我改造，或者以为他们必须在很短的时间内完成彻底的改造，否则就不能工作，都是不对的。一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。”周总理的这些指示，虽然是针对资产阶级知识分子说的，但对我们资产阶级分子来说，同样是非常重要的。这是党对我们的最大关怀和期望。我们有决心遵照周总理的指示，坚决贯彻以政治思想改造为统帅，以劳动和实践为基础，以企业或者工作岗位为基地，并把这三者结合起来的方针，在党的领导下，在工人群众的帮助支持下，积极地参加社会主义建设，在工作实践中不断地破资本主义立场和思想，立社会主义立场和思想，千方百计地在工作岗位上或企业中积极服务，作出成绩，迎接我国伟大的建国十周年！
    最近我军完全控制山南地区和喜马拉雅山北部所有边境国防要点，这是对西藏叛国集团一个致命打击
    当我国社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展的时候，帝国主义者对我们取得的与日俱增的辉煌成就是不甘心的，也是害怕的。他们千方百计地勾结国内反动派或叛乱分子，进行恶毒的诬蔑和破坏。最近西藏发生的叛乱事件，就是一个明证。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结了帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，公然发动了武装叛乱，企图制造分裂，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力。西藏上层反动集团这一叛国罪行，引起了西藏僧俗人民和全国人民的极大愤怒，我们的西藏军区部队，在西藏广大僧俗人民的支持下，迅速地肃清了大批叛匪和窜匪，现在又胜利地完全控制了山南地区和喜马拉雅山北部所有边境国防要点。这是对西藏叛国集团一个致命的打击，也是对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子一个沉重的打击。但是，一贯敌视中国人民的帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子们，近来竟明目张胆地利用西藏叛乱事件，对我国内政进行露骨的干涉。西藏从来就是我国领土的一部分，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子却诬蔑我为“侵略”。西藏人从来就是我国民族大家庭的成员，而印度的扩张主义分子以及某些政治家却说：“西藏人是西藏人，不是中国人。”我们人人痛恨的叛国分子，却任其进入印度，并被热诚招待。一个荒谬透顶的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是通过印度外交官散发的，而且据说是和印度总理使节梅农长期会谈后拟定的。文件的内容颠倒黑白，充分暴露了作者那副扩张主义分子的丑恶嘴脸，而更令人愤怒的是印度孟买警察当局，最近更纵容扩张主义分子公然在我领事馆前“示威”，侮辱我伟大领袖毛主席像，我警告印度扩张主义分子，侮辱我国领袖就是侮辱我国六亿五千万人民，我们坚决抗议！我们严厉谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的阴谋和一切挑衅行为。西藏是我国神圣领土的不可分割的一部分，我们决不容许任何人干涉我国内政，决不容许任何人破坏我国的领土完整和民族团结。我们坚持执行和平共处的五项原则，但是任何企图破坏我国统一，干涉我国内政的阴谋活动，都将遭到彻底的失败。我坚决拥护政府对西藏问题所采取的各项措施。我相信西藏人民从此将得到新生，逐步摆脱落后的黑暗的生活，在祖国大家庭里，和全国各兄弟民族团结在一起，共同走上繁荣进步的光明大道。
