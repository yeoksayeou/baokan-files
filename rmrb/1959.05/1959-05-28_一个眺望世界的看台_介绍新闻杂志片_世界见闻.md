    A Vantage Point Overlooking the World
    ——Introducing the News Magazine Film “World Sightings”
    Gao Han
    “World Sightings” is a new type of film that only began appearing on Chinese screens in 1958. Although it has only been around for a short time, it has already been welcomed by a wide audience. The reason is that it selects shots with typical significance from newsreels of various countries and uses the method of comparing East and West, good and evil, to concisely, sharply, and eloquently demonstrate the truth that "the enemy rots away day by day, and we get better day by day." A "World Sightings" screening lasts only eight or nine minutes and contains only six or seven news topics, but it can introduce the audience to an image-rich world full of contradictions, allowing people to see a microcosm of contemporary international life; to understand what is darkness and what is light, and why light will inevitably triumph over darkness, thus strengthening the audience's sympathy for the oppressed nations, their hatred of imperialism, and their love and faith in socialism and communism.
    In "World Sightings" we can see the citizens of Hiroshima, Japan, gathering to mourn the victims of the atomic bomb disaster. They organized a thousand-kilometer peace march from Hiroshima to Tokyo to participate in the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament in Tokyo, expressing the people's determination not to let the world be dragged into another war. The faces of the victims at these gatherings show the infinite suffering of humanity after the nuclear holocaust. But "World Sightings" tells us that while the Soviet Union unilaterally stopped nuclear weapons testing, Britain and the United States continue to test nuclear weapons. On the screen, we can see the flames of a hydrogen bomb explosion suddenly and violently rushing upwards from the ground on Christmas Island; we can see the situation of Japanese sailors sailing on the high seas suffering from radioactive dust caused by American nuclear weapons testing.
    In "World Sightings" we see Bulgaria lowering prices again, and people buying goods in supply and marketing cooperatives; but sailors in Hamburg, West Germany, are on strike, ships are out of service, coal mine gates are closed, and the unemployed fill the streets; workers in London, England, are also on strike, and there are no buses on the streets; Belgian police even use water cannons and tear gas to deal with the sea of strikers in the square, but the strike does not stop as a result.
    "World Sightings" focuses on showing two completely different lifestyles. The cultural life of socialist countries is rich and colorful, while capitalist countries are extremely bored, decadent, and degenerate. In the United States, there are women's wrestling performances, where biting, kicking, hitting, and tearing hair, and throwing the referee off the stage, become the most interesting content for the audience. There are bull-riding competitions, where the bull throws the rider off and tramples him to death, breaks through the defenses, and runs wildly over countless spectators, killing people on the streets. Japan has crazy go-go dances; there are strange things like the new surrealist masters painting: painting wild boars on the backs of naked women, supposedly because this year is the year of the pig in the zodiac; tying chickens with ropes, painting their feet with paint, and having the painter manipulate them, letting them hop on the canvas, the name of this painting is "The Hen's Sorrow"; two fat men wrestling on a large canvas with paint on it, and when the paint covers their whole bodies, the masterpiece is complete.
    "World Sightings" truthfully reports the dissatisfaction and disgust of the people of the world with the Western world. The people of West Germany oppose the United States arming West Germany with nuclear weapons; the people of Japan struggle with the police to shout "Yankees go home from Okinawa!"; the people of Britain march with signs saying "No American bases here!"; the people of Algeria fight in the flames of anti-colonialism; the Cuban rebels overthrow the traitorous dictatorial government; American Vice President Nixon, who went to Venezuela for a visit, was attacked by countless stones, eggs, saliva, and rotten fruit from the local people, the car windows were smashed, and he had to hide in the embassy, ​​daring not to show his face, and finally slipped away, writing an unprecedented ugly drama in the world's diplomatic history for imperialist politicians...
    Based on the above examples, it can be seen that it is no accident that "World Sightings" is so fascinating, thought-provoking, and has become a new type of news documentary film with special persuasive power. Now it has become a platform for our audience to overlook the world. In 1959, the Central News Documentary Film Studio will increase its production by 50% compared to last year. For the general audience, this is undoubtedly good news. (Attached pictures)
    Are they wrestling? No! Two artists are "creating."
    The hen paints for the artist, titled "The Hen's Sorrow." Is this the hen's sorrow, or the artist's sorrow?
    Savage American women's wrestling performance. Look, the winner's foot is stepping on the loser's head!

    一个眺望世界的看台
    ——介绍新闻杂志片“世界见闻”
    高汉
    “世界见闻”是1958年才开始在我国银幕上出现的一个新片种。它问世时间虽短，但已为广大观众所欢迎。原因在于：从各国新闻片中选出具有典型意义的镜头，用东西对照、好丑相比的手法，简洁、锐利而又雄辩地表现了“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的真理。一本“世界见闻”放映时间不过八、九分钟，包含的新闻主题不过六、七个，却能把观众引入一个充满矛盾的形象世界，使人们从那里看到当代国际生活的缩影；了解何谓黑暗，何谓光明，何以光明必将战胜黑暗、于是增强了观众对被压迫民族的同情，对帝国主义的憎恨，对社会主义、共产主义的热爱和信心。
    我们可以在“世界见闻”里看到日本广岛市民集会悼念遭受原子弹灾害的牺牲者，他们组织了从广岛到东京的千公里和平大游行，到东京参加第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会，表达了人民不能让世界被拖入另一次大战的决心。这些集会上一张张受难者的脸，表现着人类遭受核武器浩劫以后的无穷痛苦。但是“世界见闻”告诉我们：苏联虽然单方面停止核武器试验，英美却不断地试验核武器。银幕上看得到突然从圣诞岛地面向高空猛烈冲卷起来的氢弹爆炸后的烈焰；看得到在公海上航行的日本船员遭受美国试验核武器而产生的放射性微尘伤害以后的情景。
    在“世界见闻”里我们看到了：保加利亚再一次降低物价，人们正在供销社里购买物品；但是西德汉堡船员却在罢工，轮船停航，煤矿场大门紧闭，失业者塞满街头；英国伦敦工人也在罢工，街道上没有一辆公共汽车；比利时的警察甚至出动水龙和催泪瓦斯来对待广场上海洋一样的罢工者，但罢工没有因此停止。
    “世界见闻”着重表现了两种截然不同的生活方式。社会主义国家的文化生活丰富多彩，资本主义国家则穷极无聊，腐朽堕落。美国有女人摔跤的表演，在那里咬、踢、打、撕头发，把裁判摔下台去都成为观众最有兴趣的内容。有人骑牛的比赛，牛把骑者颠复下来踩死，冲破防范，成群地在数不清的观众身上狂奔，杀人满街。日本有疯狂的阿飞舞；有新超现实派大师作画那样的奇事：在上身赤裸的女人背上画野猪，据说是因为今年是十二属相中的猪年；把鸡用绳缚起来，脚掌涂上颜料，由画家操纵着，让它在画布上蹦跳，这幅画的名称是“母鸡的悲哀”；两个胖大男子，在一块放着颜料的大画布上摔跤，等到颜料涂遍全身，杰作也就完成了。
    “世界见闻”真实地报道了世界人民对西方世界的不满和厌恶。西德人民反对美国用核武器武装西德；日本人民为了喊出“美国佬从冲绳岛滚出去！”和警察进行斗争；英国人民举着“这里不要美国基地！”的标语游行；阿尔及利亚人民在反殖民主义的烽火中战斗；古巴起义军打倒卖国独裁政府；前往委内瑞拉访问的美国副总统尼克松受到当地人民无数石块、鸡蛋、唾沫、烂水果的袭击，汽车玻璃被打碎了，自己只好躲在使馆里不敢露头，最后溜之大吉，为世界外交史写下帝国主义政治家旷古未有的丑剧……
    就上述各例，可以看出“世界见闻”之所以引人入胜，发人深思，成为新闻纪录电影中一个具有特殊说服力的新片种，决不是偶然的。现在它已经成为我国观众用以眺望世界的看台。1959年，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂将要使它比去年增产50％。对于广大观众来说，这无疑是一个好消息。（附图片）
    他们在摔跤吗？不！是两位美术家正在进行“创作”。
    母鸡替美术家作画，题名“母鸡的悲哀”。这是母鸡的悲哀，还是艺术家的悲哀？
    野蛮的美国女子摔跤表演。你看，胜利者的脚正踩在失败者的头上哩！
