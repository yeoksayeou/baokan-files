Small Information

    About Early Rice
    In the southern and central regions of China, early rice is generally sown in early spring for seedling cultivation, and transplanted between "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day) and "Guyu" (Grain Rain), with an entire growth period (including seedling cultivation) of about 120 days. The "early" in early rice has two meanings: short growth period and early maturity; early planting season.
    Early rice is divided into two types: double-season early rice and single-season early rice. The subsequent crop (the crop planted immediately after) of double-season early rice is double-season late rice; the subsequent crops of single-season early rice are corn, sweet potatoes, etc. in some areas, and ratooning rice in other areas. Currently, the majority of early rice planted in southern regions is double-season early rice.
    Maturity period of early rice: areas south of the Nanling Mountains, from early June to mid-June; areas north of the Nanling Mountains, late June; areas in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, from mid-July to late July; areas in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from late July to early August.

    关于早稻
    我国南部和中部地区的早稻，一般是早春下种育秧，“清明”“谷雨”间插秧，整个生长期（包括育秧）在一百二十天左右。早稻的“早”字包括这样两个意思：生长期短，成熟早；种植的季节早。
    早稻分双季早稻和一季早稻两种。双季早稻的后作（紧接着种植的作物）是双季晚稻；一季早稻的后作，有些地区是玉米、甘薯等，有的地区是蓄留再生稻。目前南方地区种植的早稻，绝大部分是双季早稻。
    早稻的成熟期：五岭以南的地区，6月上旬到6月中旬；五岭以北的地区，6月下旬；长江中游地区，7月中旬到7月下旬；长江下游地区，7月下旬到8月初。
