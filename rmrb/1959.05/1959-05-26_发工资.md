Getting Paid
    Hu Jixiang
    In the evening, the Shengtao People's Commune was distributing wages. The fifth name called was Yang Rongfang. Yang Rongfang walked into the office and handed his personal seal to the accountant. The accountant took the seal, stamped it under his name, and handed him a stack of RMB along with it, saying kindly, "This is your money, please count it." Yang Rongfang quickly took the money, didn't even count it, and walked away with a smile.
    On the way home, his thoughts were faster than his feet, thinking about this and that. He thought: I never imagined that I, this old overspending household, would receive so much money today! If it weren't for the Party leading us to build communes and carry out the Great Leap Forward, hey... That's right! The bedding is already worn out, it should be replaced. And Xiaohong's cotton coat should be replaced too. Alas! Her mother is so old-fashioned, over thirty years old and doesn't wear colorful clothes. Tomorrow at the market, I'm going to buy her some flowered fabric, see if she'll wear it! Right, as the saying goes, sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's hard, money should still be used sparingly. I should take some to deposit in the bank!
    Thinking and walking, he unknowingly arrived at the gate. Yang Rongfang pushed open the door and saw his wife sitting alone under the kerosene lamp, making shoe soles. He gently asked, "Are they all asleep?" "They're all asleep. How much did you get?" He took the money out of his pocket and said excitedly, "A big stack!" His wife saw it and exclaimed, "So much!" "Quiet, don't wake the children. I haven't counted it yet, what are you yelling about?" Yang Rongfang said as he moved closer to the lamp, sat down on a small stool, picked up the money, and counted it one by one: "What's going on? Thirty-six yuan and eighty cents?" He was taken aback and quickly turned the kerosene lamp up higher, then counted it again, one by one. It was still thirty-six yuan and eighty cents. He handed the money to his wife and asked her to count it again. His wife took it and counted it; it was still thirty-six yuan and eighty cents. "Calculate how much is too much?" Yang Rongfang became anxious. His wife closed her eyes and was silent for a moment, then said, "Twenty-five yuan and seven." Yang Rongfang said, "Quickly sort it out and give it to me, I'll take it back right away! Right away!" "Tomorrow wouldn't be too late! The office is more than twenty li away, and it's dark. Why be so anxious?" "Anxious? The accountant made a mistake, he's probably sweating profusely. Hurry up and sort it out!" She knew his stubborn temper and didn't say more, so she sorted it out and gave it to him.
    His wife lit a torch for him and saw him to the gate. As soon as he stepped out, snowflakes fluttered onto his face. His wife shivered and said, "Oh dear, it's snowing again, what should we do? The road is wet, and the torch won't light. I think you should take it tomorrow!" "I should still take it back! The accountant has been busy these days. If he has to check the accounts all night because of this money, that would be too much." When his wife heard this, she also felt it made sense. She went to get his raincoat and bamboo hat, looked at him gently, and said softly, "Then you go!"
    Yang Rongfang put on the raincoat, wore the bamboo hat, hugged his arms to his chest, lowered his head, and ran towards the office...

    发工资
    胡吉祥
    晚上，胜陶人民公社发工资，第五个名字就喊到杨荣芳。杨荣芳走进办公室，把私章递给会计，会计接过他的私章，在他名字底下盖了一下，便连同一叠人民币一起交给他，和和蔼蔼地说：“这是你的钱，你清一清。”杨荣芳赶快接过钱来，数也没数，就笑嘻嘻地走了。
    在回家的路上，他的思想比他的脚步还快，一会想这，一会想那。他想：想不到我这个老超支户，今天领得这么多钱！要不是党领导建公社，搞大跃进呀，嘿……是呵！那床铺盖早已盖成沱沱，该换了，小红那件棉衣，也该换一换了。哎！她妈硬是老封建，三十几的人不穿花衣服，明天赶场，我偏要给她买点花布，看她穿不穿？对啦，常言说得好，有时容易无时难，钱还是要省着用，拿点去存银行吧！
    想着走着，不觉来到大门口。杨荣芳推门进去一看，只见他女人独自一个坐在煤油灯下打鞋底，便轻轻地问：“都睡了吗？”“都睡了，领的多少？”他从怀里把钱摸出来，兴奋地说：“一大叠！”他女人一见，惊叫起来：“这么多呀！”“轻点，看把娃儿吵醒了，我还没数，你叫什么？”杨荣芳边说边靠近灯旁，在一个小板凳上坐下来，拿起钱，一五一十地数着：“咋个搞的？三十六元八角？”他不觉一怔，急忙把煤油灯扭大点，又一张一张地数了一道，还是三十六元八角。他把钱递给他女人，叫她再数一遍。他女人接过来一数，还是三十六元八角。“算算看多了好多？”杨荣芳着了急。他女人闭上眼睛沉默了一阵，说：“二十五元七。”杨荣芳说：“快清出来给我，马上送去！马上送去！”“明天也不迟嘛！隔办公室二十多里，天又黑，何必这样急呢？”“急？会计错了账，恐怕忙得满头大汗了。快点清出来吧！”她晓得他的脾气硬，不再多说，便照数清出来交给他。
    他女人替他点了个火把，送他到大门口，一出门，扑脸飘来一些雪花。他女人打了个寒噤，说道：“哎呀，又下起雪来了，咋个办呢？路又湿，火把也点不燃，我看还是明天送去算了！”“还是送去吧！会计这几天已忙坏了。要是为了这笔钱，再让他查一夜账，那就太过意不去了。”他女人一听也觉得有理，又去把 蓑衣斗笠拿来，温温柔柔看他一眼，轻言细语地说：“那你就去吧！”
    杨荣芳披上蓑衣，戴上斗笠，两手往胸前一抱，埋起脑壳就往办公室奔去了……（附图片）
