An Ophthalmology Expert
By our staff reporter Zhu Zemin

    In late April, Yang Fujiang, a patient, came to the Xingtai Eye Hospital in Hebei. His right eye had been blind for more than a year, and his left eye had only a little vision left. After examination by Yin Dingfan, the hospital's director, it was found that the condition was very serious. The patient's retina had completely detached from the eyeball and needed immediate surgery. Because the retina had been detached from the eyeball for too long, it increased the difficulty of the surgery. Yin Dingfan did not hesitate, put on his surgical gown, and with the help of an assistant, first cut off the tympanic membrane of about one millimeter on the patient's eyeball. He carefully completed the tympanic membrane removal surgery and continued to suture the incision. At this time, he encountered a problem: if he used the usual suture method, each two stitches would form a knot, which would cause pain to the patient. He immediately changed the suture surgery to an I-shaped shape, suturing it with a single thread, so that there were no knots and the suture was firm. The operation went very smoothly. More than two hours later, Yang Fujiang opened his eyes and saw that his right eye could actually distinguish his five fingers. The eye that had been blind for more than a year had regained its sight.
    After reading the above paragraph, people may think that the director of this eye hospital is a medical expert, or at least a senior intellectual who graduated from a medical university. No, neither. He is an old Red Army soldier who only attended private school for two or three years and participated in the 25,000-Li Long March! The reason why an old Red Army soldier can become an ophthalmologist is because he has a heart of infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, and is the result of his tenacious and hard study under the nurturing of the Party.
    As early as 1933, when Yin Dingfan was fourteen years old, he joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. At that time, he was still a "little devil" in the army and became a nurse. During the difficult years of the Long March, climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, he joined the Communist Party of China. Since then, this poor peasant child, who lost his parents at an early age, grew up in the revolutionary ranks and in the arduous struggle of fighting in the north and south, as if he had found a relative. He gradually became a dispenser and pharmacist from a nurse. After a year of training at the army's health school in 1940, he became a surgeon and learned general surgical operations. But learning to be an ophthalmologist only started in the second half of 1946. At that time, the conditions were not very good, and he could only work as an assistant to an ophthalmologist while studying. The poor conditions did not affect Yin Dingfan's confidence at all. He not only carefully observed and studied every action of the doctor in clinical diagnosis and surgical operation during work, but also studied books on ophthalmology techniques such as May's Ophthalmology, Ophthalmic Surgery, Physiological Anatomy, and Optics. For someone who had only read for two or three years, he encountered countless difficulties in learning this specialized knowledge. For example, he had not learned basic knowledge such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics, so he further studied middle school physics and other courses on his own. In the process of learning, because of his tenacious and diligent research, he finally overcame all difficulties and gradually mastered the basic knowledge and skills required to be an ophthalmologist. At the end of 1950, the Party sent him to the advanced training class of Shanghai Medical College for further study, where he mastered more abundant ophthalmological knowledge and learned more complex ophthalmic operations such as corneal transplantation.
    After returning to Xingtai Eye Hospital, he devoted all his knowledge and skills to patients. In 1955, Zhang Jiguang, a cadre of the Anyang Cooperative General Agency in Henan Province, suffered from chronic hematoma in the deep part of his eye socket. The patient's traumatic injury caused blood accumulation into a tumor, which is a very tricky disease in ophthalmology. According to ophthalmic surgery, the removal of this tumor requires cutting open the bone. At that time, the hospital did not have this surgical equipment. At the same time, he considered that this type of surgery had many sequelae, the mildest of which would cause eye socket collapse, which would look very bad. He was determined to find a surgical method that could reduce the patient's pain without sequelae. After several days of hard thinking, he finally designed a method of simultaneously incising the orbital margin of the upper and lower orbits to perform the operation. As a result, the tumor was successfully removed in three hours, restoring the patient's normal vision. Such things are no longer rare in Comrade Yin Dingfan. In recent years, he has never missed any opportunity to improve surgical operations and improve his skills. He has not only improved more than 20 major operations, but also designed and manufactured plane visual field meters and refrigerators and other medical equipment, which are indispensable in ophthalmic diagnosis.
    How to relieve the patient's pain and restore sight to the blind is a topic that Yin Dingfan thinks about day and night. He has never been intimidated by any difficulties. His method is: think more, learn more, study more, and ask more. When he began to promote corneal transplantation in the hospital, he encountered the biggest difficulty: a serious shortage of corneal transplantation materials. Without transplant materials, corneal transplantation surgery cannot be performed, and this surgery is an effective way to treat some difficult eye diseases. So, he tried every means to study substitutes. Once, a patient with eye trauma who needed to have his eyeball removed came to the hospital. He carefully observed and found that although the patient's eyeball had non-suppurative inflammation, most of the cornea was transparent. He immediately thought: "This patient's eyeball is about to be removed. Wouldn't it be a good idea to use the cornea of this eyeball as a corneal transplantation material?" But he searched all the ophthalmology literature, and many Chinese and foreign ophthalmology experts believed that all corneas with intraocular inflammation could not be used. "Should I just let it go?" When will the patient's pain be relieved?" He considered it repeatedly, and a high sense of responsibility made him unable to put this question down for a long time. He thought: he must consider the reasonable parts of the literature, but he cannot completely believe in the literature. So he continued to study and experiment boldly. He used the cornea with intraocular inflammation caused by trauma to perform corneal transplantation surgery on six patients, and the results were all successful. Even a patient who had suffered from deep keratitis for more than a year and had residual corneal leukoplakia completely recovered normal vision after corneal transplantation. Yin Dingfan was not satisfied with such gains. He also wanted to find more ways to replace the cornea. He thought more than once: "If there is a transparent thing to replace the corneal graft, that would be even better, and it would make more blind patients recover their health." But what can be used to replace it? He first thought of using glass, but failed. Once he saw an introduction in the "Chinese Journal of Ophthalmology" about artificial corneas made of plastic by Japan being tested on animals, which gave him great inspiration. But Yin Dingfan did not know how to make plastic corneal grafts, how to operate the surgery, and so on. The article did not introduce it either. So he pondered on his own, bought a plastic sheet for a watch case on the market, came back and designed a pattern, and used his spare time to grind the plastic sheet into a corneal graft and experimented on rabbits, and failed three times in a row. He found the reasons from the failures and continued to study and improve. After the fourth improvement of the shape of the plastic sheet, he finally succeeded in the preliminary experiment on the eyes of rabbits. He summed up the experience of the fourth success, and painstakingly studied and drew ten different patterns of plastic corneal grafts, preparing to continue the experiment.
    More than ten years of tenacious and hard work have made Yin Fan Ding an excellent ophthalmologist. He not only undertakes the most difficult and complex surgical operations, but also teaches his skills to others without reservation. With his help, six doctors in the hospital have learned complex corneal transplantation surgery. He has also published four empirical papers, including "Preliminary Report on Corneal Transplantation" and "Several Opinions and Clinical Effect Observation on Improvement of Cataract Surgery". For more than ten years, Yin Dingfan has worked diligently day after day and year after year. He regards the pain of patients as his own pain. When he encounters a patient with a severe illness, he is so anxious that he cannot sleep. He goes to the ward to visit the patient once or twice every day to make the patient feel comforted spiritually. When the blind patient recovers his health, he shares the joy and happiness with the patient. Therefore, Yin Dingfan has become the most respected and welcomed doctor by patients. The Party and the people have also given him great encouragement and honor. He has been rated as a model doctor in Hebei Province several times, and this year he attended the National Conference of Active Builders of Socialism for Family Members of Martyrs, Family Members of Soldiers, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Construction Soldiers for the second time.

    一个眼科专家
    本报记者　朱泽民
    4月下旬，河北邢台眼科医院来了一个名叫杨福江的病人。他的右眼已经失明一年多，只有左眼稍微还有一点视力。经过医院院长尹丁凡的检查，发现病情很严重，病人的视网膜已经完全同眼球剥离了，需要立即动手术；由于视网膜脱离眼球时间太久，增加了手术上的困难。尹丁凡没有犹豫，穿起了手术服，在助手的帮助下，先把病人眼球上一毫米左右的鼓膜切下。他小心翼翼地完成了鼓膜切除手术，又继续缝合刀口。这时候遇到了一个难题：如果用往常的缝合办法，每缝两针结一个疙疸，就会给病人造成痛苦，他当即把缝合手术改成工字形的形状，用一条线就缝合起来，这样既没有疙疸，缝合口又牢固。手术进行得十分顺利。两个多小时以后，杨福江睁开眼睛一看，居然右眼能够分得清五指了，失明了一年多的眼睛又重见了光明。
    读了上面这一段，人们也许会以为这位眼科医院的院长是个医学专家，或者起码也是个医科大学毕业的高级知识分子吧。不，都不是。他是一个只上过两、三年私塾，参加过二万五千里长征的老红军！一个老红军战士所以能成为眼科医师，就是因为他有一颗对党、对人民无限忠诚的心，在党的哺育下，顽强刻苦地学习的结果。
    远在1933年，尹丁凡十四岁的时候，就参加了中国工农红军。那时候，他在部队里还是个“小鬼”，当了一名看护。在长征爬雪山过草地的艰难岁月里，他参加了中国共产党。从此，这个自小就失去了父母的贫农孩子，像找到了亲人一样，在革命队伍里、在南征北战的艰苦斗争中成长起来。他从看护逐渐成为调剂员、司药员。1940年经过部队卫生学校一年的训练，又成了一名外科医师，学会了一般的外科手术。但是学习做一个眼科医师，还是从1946年下半年才开始的。那时候，条件还不太好，只能一面给眼科医师当助手，一面学习。条件差，却丝毫没有影响到尹丁凡的信心。他不但在工作时细心地观察、学习医师在临床诊断和手术操作时的每一个动作，而且自修了梅氏眼科学、眼科手术学、生理解剖、屈光学等有关眼科技术的书籍。对于他这样一个只读过两、三年书的人来说，学习这些专门知识，不知遇到了多少困难。例如，物理、化学、数学等基础知识都没有学过，于是他就再自修中学的物理等课程。在学习的过程中，因为他顽强刻苦的钻研，终于战胜了一切困难，逐渐掌握了做为一个眼科医师所具备的基本知识和技术。1950年底，党又派他到上海医学院的进修班深造，在那里，他又掌握了更为丰富的眼科知识，学习了角膜移植术等更为复杂的眼科手术。
    他回到邢台眼科医院以后，又把自己的一切知识和技术都献给了病人。1955年，河南省安阳合作总社的干部张计光患了眼窝深部陈旧性血肿，患者由于外伤造成了积血成瘤，这在眼科中是一种很棘手的病症。按照眼科手术学，这种肿瘤的摘除需要切开骨头，当时医院里没有这种手术设备，同时他考虑到这种手术的后遗症很多，最轻的也要造成眼窝蹋陷，外表很不好看。他就下决心想找出一个既能减少病人痛苦又没有后遗症的手术方法。经过几天的苦思钻研，终于设计出了一个在上下眼眶的眶缘同时切开动手术的办法，结果在三个小时内就成功地摘出了肿瘤，使病人恢复了正常的视力。像这样的事情，在尹丁凡同志身上已经不是什么稀罕事了。几年来，他从不放过任何一个机会来改进手术操作，提高技术，他不但改进了二十多项较大的手术，还自己设计制造了眼科诊断中不可缺少的平面视野计以及冷藏箱等医疗器械。
    怎样才能为病人解除痛苦，让盲人重见光明，这是尹丁凡日日夜夜苦思苦想的题目。他从没有被任何一次困难吓倒过。他的办法就是：多想，多学，多钻，多问。当他开始在医院里推行角膜移植术的时候，就遇到了一个最大的困难：角膜移植的材料严重缺乏。没有移植材料，就不能做角膜移植手术，而这种手术正是治疗一些疑难眼病的有效办法。于是，他就千方百计地研究代用品。有一次，医院里来了一个患眼外伤而需要摘出眼球的病人，他就仔细地观察，发现病人的眼球虽然有非化脓性的炎症，但角膜大部分都是透明的。他立刻就想到：“这个患者的眼球就要摘除了，如果利用这种眼球的角膜来做角膜移植材料，岂不是一个好办法？”但是他翻遍了眼科文献，不少的中外眼科专家都认为一切患有眼内炎症的角膜都不能使用。“难道就这样轻轻放过吗？”病人的痛苦到什么时候才能解除呢？”他反复考虑着，高度的责任感使他久久地不能把这个问题放下。他想：既要考虑文献中合理的部分，又不能完全迷信文献。于是他继续大胆地钻研试验，他利用由于外伤而造成眼内炎症的角膜为六个患者做角膜移植手术以后，结果都成功了。连一个患了一年多深层角膜炎并且遗留有角膜白斑的病人，经过移植角膜以后，也完全恢复了正常的视力。这样的收获，尹丁凡并不满足，他还想找出更多的办法来代替角膜。他不止一次地想：“如果有一种透明的东西来代替角膜移植片，那就更好了，就会使更多的失明患者恢复健康。”可是用什么东西来代替呢？他开始想到用玻璃，但是失败了。有一次他在“中华眼科杂志”上看到一篇关于日本用塑料制造的人工角膜在动物上试验的介绍，这给了他很大的启发。但是塑料角膜片怎样制造、手术怎样操作等等问题，尹丁凡不知道，文章中也没有介绍。他就自己琢磨，到市场上买了一个套手表壳的塑料片，回来就设计了一个图案，利用休息时间把塑料片磨成角膜移植片，在家兔上进行试验，连着三次都失败了。他就从失败中找出原因，继续研究改进，第四次改进了塑料片的形状以后，终于在家兔的眼上初步试验成功了。他总结了第四次成功的经验，又苦心钻研，画出了十种不同的塑料角膜片的图案，准备继续试验。
    十几年的顽强刻苦的努力，尹凡丁成为一个出色的眼科医师。他不但担负着最困难、最复杂的手术操作，而且把自己的技术无保留地教给别人。在他的帮助下，医院里已经有六个医师学会了复杂的角膜移植手术。他还发表了“角膜移植术初步报告”、“白内障手术改进的几点意见与临床效果观察”等四篇经验性的论文。十几年来，尹丁凡日复一日、年复一年地勤恳地工作着，他把病人的痛苦当做自己的痛苦，遇到一个病势严重的患者，他着急得不能入睡，每天都要一次、两次地去到病房看望病人，让病人在精神上得到快慰，当着双目失明的病人恢复了健康的时候，他和病人同享着愉快和幸福。因此，尹丁凡成了最受病人尊敬和欢迎的医生。党和人民也给了他巨大的鼓励和荣誉。他曾经几次被评为河北省的模范医生，今年又第二次出席了全国烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人社会主义建设积极分子大会。
