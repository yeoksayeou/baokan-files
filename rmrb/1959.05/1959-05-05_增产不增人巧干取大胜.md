Increase Production Without Increasing Manpower, Skillfully Work to Achieve Great Victory

Jilin Paper Mill Increases Production by 39% This Year, Reduces Staff by More Than 400

Hangzhou Oxygen Machine Factory's Forging Group Two Completes the Year's Workload in Just Over Three Months

This newspaper reports that the Jilin Paper Mill has conscientiously carried out the production increase and economy campaign, implemented the principle of increasing production and work without increasing manpower. The originally planned increase of 2,000 people not only is unnecessary, but 445 people can also be reduced.

After the production tasks of the Jilin Paper Mill increased, the whole factory originally planned to add 2,023 people. The factory Party committee believed that it was necessary to tap labor potential and increase labor productivity to achieve the leap forward plan without increasing the labor force. At that time, the Party committee instructed the personnel department to conduct a comprehensive investigation and analysis, and the Party committee secretary personally presided over several small cadre meetings to meticulously study the labor plan for 1959. During the study, some leading cadres in some units had incorrect ideas such as "more people are better," "better safe than sorry," and "increased production must increase people." The Party committee educated all factory cadres. After improving the level of understanding of the cadres, the staffing of each unit gradually decreased, from the initial plan to increase more than 2,000 people to 1,700 people. In February, when the Party committee organized all factory workers to vigorously engage in the technical innovation campaign, it listed solving the labor shortage as a key issue, and required that this problem be solved through vigorously carrying out technical innovation, improving tools, improving equipment, improving operating methods, advocating "one person, many skills" and "one machine, multiple uses." As a result, the number was reduced to 960 people, and finally reduced to 589 people.

On March 21, the Jilin Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a labor force planning meeting, requiring all factories and enterprises to increase production and work without increasing manpower, and to reduce manpower. After careful discussion and study by the factory Party committee, this year's output increased by 38.99% compared with last year, and the number of personnel can be reduced by 445 people.

The main experiences of the Jilin Paper Mill in being able to increase production and work without increasing manpower, and even reduce manpower, are:

(1) Vigorously Carry Out Technical Revolution. Mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out technical revolution, improve tools, improve equipment, improve operating methods, and improve the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization and the technical level of the masses. In the first quarter of the technical revolution campaign, the factory workers put forward a total of 3,966 suggestions, of which 2,838 were adopted, and 1,276 have been put into production. These reforms have created good conditions for improving labor productivity this year. For example, Guan Changyou of the Raw Material Section improved the wood shaving machine, changing from two sets of equipment to one set, which increased work efficiency by more than three times and saved half of the personnel. Shu Xiquan of the Engineering Team improved the equipment. In the past, hemp was cut manually, but now it has been changed to semi-mechanization, which has increased work efficiency by 17 times.

(2) Vigorously carry out mass movements. The factory resolutely implemented the Party's mass line, with the factory determining labor force plan indicators, holding factory-wide cadre meetings and worker congresses, and factory leaders making mobilization reports. After the meeting, each unit, in conjunction with its own situation, widely mobilized the masses to use the methods of large-scale airing of views, large-scale blooming of ideas, big-character posters, and large-scale debates to offer suggestions and find key points and tricks, so that all factory workers set off a climax of discussing national plans, tapping labor potential, and improving labor productivity. Through this series of measures, workers actively participated in the movement. For example, the crushing section of the steel mill originally required more than 60 people per shift, and it was not possible to continuously crush all day long. Now, with the installation of conveyor belt transportation and the implementation of vehicle-based operations, half of the personnel are saved, and crushing work can be carried out continuously all day long, increasing work efficiency by 50%.

(3) Further improve labor organization, rationally use labor force, and determine advanced quotas. Rationally use the labor force, conscientiously achieve "everyone has something to do, and there is no idle person everywhere" and strive to achieve "everyone makes the best use of their talents and each gets what they deserve."

Tighten staffing, streamline management and service personnel, merge institutions, and reduce levels, so that the total number of management personnel is gradually reduced to about 7% of the total number of employees.

(4) Give full play to the role of cadres in participating in labor and solve the problem of labor shortage. The existing system of 468 cadres participating in physical labor has been regularized, and Friday of each week is designated as the cadre labor day. This not only exercises and transforms the thinking of cadres, but also familiarizes them with production technology and solves the labor force needed for production. The annual total of 83 people participating in labor every day is equivalent to all the production personnel in the factory's first workshop.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th -- "Achieve victory by working skillfully and be the masters of time." This is the slogan put forward by Forging Group Two of the Hangzhou Oxygen Machine Factory. Encouraged by this slogan, the workers in this group completed the annual workload ahead of schedule on April 14.

Forging Group Two of the Forging Workshop of the Hangzhou Oxygen Machine Factory, which has won the title of provincial advanced group for six consecutive years, completed six and a half years of workload last year. In just over three months this year, it completed the annual workload of 23,900 man-hours for 1959. This is four times more than the same period last year, and the scrap rate is only 0.0045%, making it a red flag on the industrial front in Zhejiang Province.

The Hangzhou Oxygen Machine Factory is one of the largest factories in China that manufactures oxygen generators. In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward, this year the production task of Forging Group Two in the first quarter was about eight times higher than the same period last year, while the number of people and equipment in the group did not increase. At the beginning of the year, when the whole group of workers discussed the production plan, most of the workers believed that it was necessary to promote the spirit of pragmatism, hard work, and skillful work, and to complete tasks that exceeded the capacity of the equipment several times in a shorter period of time. In order to find tricks and tap potential, they launched a heated debate within the group, laying an ideological foundation for completing the annual workload ahead of schedule.

Group leader Sang Baokang is not only a person who takes the lead in everything, but also good at mobilizing the masses and mobilizing the strength of the entire group to complete tasks. In January, the group received a batch of tasks to manufacture "102 Connecting Rods." Sang Baokang thought: This product is very complicated. If we do not improve the tools and only rely on physical strength, the output and quality will not be guaranteed. Therefore, he used his brains to improve a "die," which increased work efficiency by three times.

In February, the group's task was 4,000 man-hours, which was equivalent to two and a half times the actual labor force of the entire group. At that time, Sang Baokang explained the plan to the workers and mobilized all the workers to discuss it. Everyone studied and found that the key product in February was the "double-curved shaft." This kind of crankshaft is very precise, and in the past, one person could only produce one a day. Therefore, a major technical innovation must be carried out. Therefore, the whole group concentrated its efforts to improve two "gauge iron molds" and a large "die" similar in shape to the crankshaft. The quality of the products made with this new tool fully met the standards, and the work efficiency was seven times higher than that of manual operation. In this way, more than 5,030 man-hours were overfulfilled in February.

Because technical innovations in this group continued to emerge one after another, in March, five months of workload was completed.

The workers of Forging Group Two also tried every means to break through the raw material barrier. In March, the factory lacked steel for making flanges, so they found a large number of scrap steel ingots in the scrap yard and used them to replace good steel for forging flanges. In order to strictly control the temperature and ensure product quality, the workers improved the heating method and added a set of pliers during forging. As a result, the forged products fully met the specifications and broke through the raw material barrier.

The workers in this group are very clear about the production plans and completion of the workshop and the group. Everyone has a clear understanding, everyone has clear goals, problems are studied collectively, responsibilities are divided, and they help each other. The veteran masters not only patiently help the apprentices, but also pay attention to their own improvement. Now, on the basis of completing the annual workload, Forging Group Two is determining the next work goal. They have proposed that the workload in the second quarter will double that of the first quarter. (Cheng Min, Zheng Zhibiao)

    增产不增人巧干取大胜
    吉林造纸厂今年增产百分之三十九人员减少四百多
    杭州制氧机厂锻工二组三个多月干完了全年工作量
    本报讯　吉林造纸厂认真开展了增产节约运动，贯彻了增产增事不增人的原则，原计划增加的两千人，现在不仅不要增加，还可以减少四百四十五人。
    吉林造纸厂生产任务增加后，全厂原来准备增加两千零二十三人。工厂党委认为应该挖掘劳动潜力，提高劳动生产率，在不增加劳动力的情况下实现跃进计划。当时党委责成人事科进行全面调查分析，并由党委书记亲自主持，分别召开了几次小型干部会议，细致地研究了1959年的劳动计划。在研究中，部分单位领导干部存在着“人多好办事”、“有备无患”和“增产必须增人”等不正确思想。党委对全厂干部进行了教育。在提高干部认识水平以后，各单位的定员逐渐减少，由开始计划增加的两千多人，削减到一千七百人。2月份党委组织全厂职工大闹技术革新运动时，把解决劳动力不足列为一个关键，要求通过大搞技术革新、改进工具、改进设备、改进操作方法、提倡“一人多艺”和“一机多用”等方法来解决这个问题。结果又削减到九百六十人，最后再削减到五百八十九人。
      3月21日，中共吉林市委召开了劳动力计划会议，要求各工厂企业增产增事不增人，并要减人。工厂党委认真讨论研究以后，结果今年产量虽然比去年增加了38.99％，人员还可减少四百四十五人。
    吉林造纸厂所以能做到增产增事不增人，并且还减了人，他们的主要经验是：
      （一）大闹技术革命。发动群众大闹技术革命，改进工具，改进设备，改进操作方法，提高机械化、半机械化程度和群众的技术水平。全厂职工在技术革命运动中，第一季度共提出建议三千九百六十六件，被采纳的有二千八百三十八件，已投入生产的有一千二百七十六件。这些改革，给今年提高劳动生产率创造了良好条件。如原料科关长有改进了木肖机，由过去的两套设备改为一套设备来作，工作效率提高了三倍以上，人员节省一半。工程队舒喜全改进设备，过去切麻用人力切，现在改为半机械化后提高工作效率十七倍。
      （二）大搞群众运动。这个厂坚决贯彻执行党的群众路线，由工厂确定劳动力计划指标，召开全厂干部会、职工大会，由工厂领导同志进行动员报告。会后各单位又结合本单位情况广泛发动群众用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，献方献计，抓关键，找窍门，使全厂职工掀起一个讨论国家计划、挖掘劳动力潜力、提高劳动生产率的高潮。通过这一系列的措施，工人积极参加运动。如钢铁场破碎部分原来每班需六十多人，还不能全日经常破碎。现在安装输送带搬运，实行车子化，人员节省一半，并能全日不停进行破碎工作，提高工作效率50％。
      （三）进一步改善劳动组织，合理使用劳动力，确定先进的定额。合理使用劳动力，认真做到“人人有事做，处处无闲人”和力争做到“人尽其才、各得其所”。
    紧缩编制，精简管理人员和服务人员，合并机构，减少层次，使管理人员总数逐步减少到占职工总数的7％左右。
      （四）充分发挥干部参加劳动的作用，解决劳动力不足问题。现有的四百六十八名干部参加体力劳动的制度做到了经常化，每周规定星期五为干部劳动日。这样既锻炼改造了干部思想，又熟悉了生产技术知识，并且解决了生产所需的劳动力。全年合计每天有八十三人参加劳动，等于这个厂第一车间全部的生产人员。
    本报杭州4日电　“以巧干取胜，作时间的主人。”这是杭州制氧机厂锻工二组提出的口号。这个组的职工在这个口号鼓舞下，于4月14日已提前完成全年工作量。
    连获六年省级先进小组称号的杭州制氧机厂锻工车间第二小组，去年一年完成了六年半工作量，今年三个多月时间完成了1959年二万三千九百工时的全年工作量。比去年同期增加四倍，废品率只占百分之零点零零四五，成为浙江省工业战线上的一面红旗。
    杭州制氧机厂是我国最大的制造制氧机的工厂之一。这个厂为了适应大跃进的需要，今年锻工车间第二小组第一季度的生产任务比去年同期增加八倍左右，而组里的人员和设备都没有增加。年初，全组工人讨论生产计划时，大部分工人认为必须发扬实干苦干巧干的精神，用较少的时间完成超过设备能力几倍的任务。他们为了找寻窍门，挖掘潜力，曾在组内发动了一次热烈的大鸣大放大辩论，为提前完成全年的工作量打下了思想基础。
    小组长桑宝康不仅是一个事事带头的人，而且还善于发动群众，动员全组的力量，来完成任务。1月份小组接到一批制造“一○二大连杆”的任务，桑宝康想：这种产品很复杂，如果不改进工具，单拼体力，产量质量都没有保证，因此动脑筋改进了一副“印模”，工作效率提高三倍。
    2月份这个组的任务是四千工时，相等于全组实际劳动力的二倍半。当时，桑宝康就把计划向工人交底，发动全组工人讨论，大家研究出2月份的关键性产品是“双弯曲轴”，这种曲轴精密度很高，过去一天一人只能生产一只，因此，必须来一个技术大革新。于是全组集中力量改进了两副“塞铁模子”和一副形状和曲轴相似的大型“印模”，用这种新工具做出来的产品质量完全符合标准，而且比手工操作工作效率提高七倍。这样，2月份又超额完成了五千零三十多个工时。
    由于这个组技术革新一个接一个地不断出现，3月份完成了五个月的工作量。
    锻工二组工人还千方百计突破原材料关。3月份，厂里做法兰的钢材不足，他们就从废料库里找出了大批废钢锭，拿来代替好钢材锻制法兰。为了严格控制温度，保证产品质量，工人们就改进了加灶方法，在锻制时，又增加一套钳子，结果锻出的产品完全符合规格，突破了原材料关。
    这个组的工人对车间和组里的生产计划和完成情况都很清楚，人人心中有数，个个目标明确，有问题集中研究，分工负责，相互帮助，老师傅不仅对学徒耐心帮助，也很注意自己的提高。现在锻工二组正在完成全年工作量的基础上，确定下一步工作的奋斗目标，他们已提出二季度的工作量比一季度还要翻一番的计划。　（程敏、郑志标）
