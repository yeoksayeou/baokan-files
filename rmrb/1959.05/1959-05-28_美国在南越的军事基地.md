Alongside the military "sweeps," Ngo Dinh Diem's congress passed Decree No. 91, establishing mobile "Special Military Tribunals" in various parts of South Vietnam. These military tribunals have the power to try and execute defendants on the spot. The verdicts of these tribunals are limited to "life imprisonment and the death penalty," and they have the power to immediately sentence "accomplices," "masterminds," and those associated with them. Clearly, these are wartime military tribunals.

From the above events, it is not difficult for us to understand the current plight of the South Vietnamese people and the murderous policies of the U.S.-Ngo clique.

In order to cover up the above heinous acts, Ngo Dinh Diem declared to a reporter from the French newspaper "Le Figaro": "Vietnam is in a state of war." Ngo Dinh Diem's newspapers echoed this, saying: "Things are imminent, and the communists have launched tentative offensives." Not long ago, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, meeting in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, also proposed the establishment of a "mobile force" and held a series of large-scale military exercises.

Here, we don't need to waste words arguing with those who spew blood. They have long since shattered these despicable fallacies with their own bloody hands. But what deserves our attention is that the policies of U.S. imperialism and Ngo Dinh Diem have seriously threatened the fate of the South Vietnamese people, further strained the situation in Southeast Asia, and severely threatened peace in the region.

The South Vietnamese people, who are in dire straits, will certainly not sit idly by and wait for death. The barbarous policies of the U.S.-Ngo clique are arousing a wave of anger among the South Vietnamese people; the contradiction between the South Vietnamese people and the U.S.-Ngo clique is becoming increasingly acute; the patriotic movement is expanding and developing even further, and the South Vietnamese people are fighting more resolutely for self-salvation.

"Tomorrow's storm is stirred up by today's wind and rain..."①

The Vietnamese people will certainly be able to crush all the conspiracies of the executioners. In this struggle, the Vietnamese people believe that they will surely gain the increasingly broad support of the people of all fraternal countries, the people of Asia and Africa, and progressive humanity throughout the world. Justice will surely prevail, and the peaceful reunification of Vietnam will be realized. The brutal path currently being taken by the U.S.-Ngo clique is a path of self-destruction.

    美国在南越的军事基地
    和军事“扫荡”进行的同时，吴庭艳的国会通过了第九十一号法令，在南越各地成立流动的“特别军事法庭”。这些军事法庭有权就地审判和处决被告。这些法庭的判决只有“无期徒刑和死刑”两种，并且有权立即判决“同谋”、“主谋”以及与之有联系的人。显然，这是战争时期的军事法庭。
    我们从上述这几件事，不难了解当前南越人民的处境和美吴集团的杀人政策。
    为了掩盖以上的罪恶行为，吴庭艳向法国“费加罗报”记者宣称：“越南正处于战争状态”。吴庭艳的报纸也随声附和说：“事情已经迫在眉睫，共产党已掀起了试探性的进攻”。不久以前，在新西兰首都惠灵顿举行会议的东南亚条约组织也提出成立“机动部队”，并连续举行大规模的军事演习。
    这里，我们不必浪费笔墨来跟那些含血喷人的家伙争辩。他们早已用自己的血手粉碎了这些卑鄙的谬论。但值得我们注意的是，美帝国主义和吴庭艳的政策已经严重地威胁南越人民的命运，使东南亚的局势更趋紧张，使这个地区的和平受到严重威胁。
    处于水深火热中的南越人民决不能坐以待毙。美吴集团的野蛮政策正在激起南越人民的愤怒浪潮；南越人民同美吴集团的矛盾日益尖锐；爱国运动正在更加扩大发展，南越人民更加坚决斗争自救。
    “明天的风暴是今天的风雨掀起的……”①
    越南人民一定能粉碎刽子手们的一切阴谋。在这场斗争中，越南人民相信，他们必将获得各兄弟国家的人民、亚非各国人民和全世界进步人类的日益广泛的支持。正义必将取得胜利，越南的和平统一必将实现。美吴集团目前所走的残暴的道路是一条自取灭亡之路。
