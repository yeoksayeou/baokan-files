On the Tibetan Plateau, an 80-year-old blind Tibetan mother, who had lived in a cowshed for decades, has now moved into a building built for her by the People's Liberation Army. Ji Xingkui, the deputy company commander of the unit that built the house for this blind mother, recently came to Beijing from Tibet. During the representative meeting of advanced units and activists in logistics work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he told reporters about this moving story.

One summer night earlier this year, the company where Ji Xingkui was stationed pursued and annihilated a group of scattered bandits and encamped in a village at the foot of a snow-capped mountain. The entire village was deserted, with doors wide open, cattle and sheep running wild, a scene of utter desolation. Company Commander Pan Changcai and Instructor Zhou Shaoluan immediately ordered the soldiers to close the doors of the houses, drive the stray cattle and sheep back into the pens, and cut green grass to feed them, so that the owners could claim them when they returned.

As the soldiers approached a low, dilapidated mud house, they heard an old woman coughing and lambs bleating. They immediately went inside and found three milk cows and three sheep. In the corner of the room sat an old woman, ragged, blind, and with wrinkles showing the infinite suffering she had experienced. The soldiers went over and said kindly to the old woman: "Granny, we are the People's Liberation Army, don't be afraid." The old woman raised her head, silent for a long time, then stretched out her hands to touch the faces and cap badges of the soldiers. Suddenly, her two deep-set eye sockets flashed with crystalline tears. She grabbed a soldier's hand and said, "Golden Zhuma! Golden Zhuma! You're back!"

"Golden Zhuma is back!" The blind mother's cry quickly spread throughout the valley. Tibetans who had fled into the mountains to avoid the bandits returned to the village in an endless stream.

When the Tibetan compatriots saw the People's Liberation Army, they took out the butter, milk residue, honey, and walnuts they had buried to welcome them. The soldiers declined the gifts from the villagers and immediately asked them to claim their cattle and sheep. The villagers were extremely moved, filled with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy, and gathered on the lawn at the entrance of the village, vying to denounce the crimes of the bandits. The blind mother, supported by her daughter-in-law and grandson Zhaxi, also poured out her grievances and hatred…

Nine years ago, the People's Liberation Army had been here. At that time, the blind mother still had a pair of kind and bright eyes. The soldiers carried water, swept the floor, and cut grass to feed the cattle for the mother's family every day. They often saved their own rations to help the old woman and the poor people of the whole village. How much the old woman loved these good troops sent by Chairman Mao! The old woman's family was a slave family, and in her life full of hardship, she had never felt such care and respect.

However, the People's Liberation Army left not long after. The local reactionary slave owners and bandits intensified their persecution of the people. The old woman's only son was murdered, and the mother's eyes lost their sight from then on. Only she, her daughter-in-law, and grandson Zhaxi were left in the family, unable to make a living. Hunger and disaster gnawed at their lives day by day. From then on, the blind mother missed the People's Liberation Army every day. She prayed to the Bodhisattva to bless them: "Golden Zhuma" come back soon to save the suffering poor!

Now, "Golden Zhuma" has indeed returned, eliminated the bandits, and brought warmth and light to this suffering mountain village. The blind mother held the soldier's hand tightly, tearfully begging: "Golden Zhuma! Now that you're back, please don't leave your mother again."

The company commander, instructor, and all the soldiers of the company unanimously expressed to the blind mother: "We are determined to eliminate harm for the Tibetan people and protect and help the Tibetan people live a free and happy life."

The soldiers carried water, swept the floor, and cut grass to feed the cattle for the blind mother's family every day, and saved their own rations to help the blind mother and the poor Tibetan compatriots in the whole village. This company also opened a blacksmith's furnace to make sickles and hoes for the Tibetan compatriots free of charge. The blacksmiths were Zhang Hongkai, a young soldier who had been a technician at the Anshun Iron Factory in Guizhou before joining the army, and Li Xianming, a soldier who came from a blacksmith's family. Tibetan compatriots came from dozens of miles away carrying broken iron to ask the soldiers to make farm tools for them. Some serfs who had no iron were given sickles made from the broken sabers seized from the bandits. From then on, the Tibetans here replaced the heavy wooden utensils with iron farm tools, and everyone was all smiles, thanking the People's Liberation Army. The blind mother handed a sickle and a hoe given to her by the soldiers to her grandson Zhaxi and said, "Child, you will now use the sickle made by Golden Zhuma to cut grass, and in the future, you will use the hoe to plant highland barley in the fields."

Sixteen-year-old Zhaxi was smart and lovely. He asked the soldiers to cut off his two small braids, keep a side parting, and put on the new woolen clothes and new shoes given to him by the work team and the soldiers. Every morning, he drove the cattle and sheep to the grassland to graze; in the evening, he cut a load of grass with a sickle and happily drove the cattle and sheep home. After tethering the cattle and penning the sheep, he ran to the company to sing, dance, read picture books, and comic books with the soldiers. He and the soldiers were as close as brothers.

One day, Platoon Leader Tian Zhuyu and Deputy Platoon Leader Huang Shitang proposed to the company leaders that the comrades in their platoon were willing to use their spare time to build a new house for the blind mother's family so that the old woman could move from the cowshed into a new home. The company commander agreed, and they immediately ran to the blind mother's house to choose a location and discuss the style of the house with her. The blind mother was overjoyed, and she couldn't even believe it was true!

The next day, the soldiers began to build on a large scale on the hillside behind the village. Platoon Leader Tian Zhuyu served as the general commander of the project. He led the soldiers, getting up early and going to bed late, going up the mountain to cut wood and building kilns to burn lime. At the same time, they leveled the foundation and carried stones… Under the beautiful snow-capped mountains, echoed the sturdy labor chants and happy songs.

This matter alarmed the Tibetan compatriots in the whole village. At first, they just came to watch the excitement out of curiosity, but later many people were moved by the soldiers' enthusiasm for labor and joined the construction team.

The blind mother's family was even busier. Zhaxi and his mother shoveled and carried soil with the soldiers, and also boiled tea and delivered water for the soldiers. The blind mother leaned on her crutches and came to the construction site, sometimes patting the soldiers' sturdy shoulders and touching the soldiers' sweaty faces; sometimes holding Platoon Leader Tian Zhuyu's hand and muttering: "You should rest soon, you're exhausted, I, the old mother, wouldn't want that."

None of the soldiers were willing to rest, and they worked even harder. They said: "Granny! So that you can move into a good house sooner, we don't feel tired no matter how tired we are!"

After working hard for several days, the two-story small mud-wood building was almost completed. The third platoon suddenly received an order to depart and carry out a new mission. Therefore, the task of building the house fell to the soldiers of the second platoon. Second Platoon Leader Guo Zhenqian and Deputy Company Commander Ji Xingkui then led all the soldiers of the platoon, working continuously for two days and two nights, and finally built the building.

This is a beautiful small building, facing south, with spacious windows. Next to the building is a lush big black peach tree, and a clear stream flows in front of the door. The blind mother asked someone to choose an auspicious day and, with the blessings of the people of the whole village and the soldiers, led her daughter-in-law and grandson, leaving the dark cowshed and moving into the new home. As she walked up the building, she excitedly covered her eyes with her hands, her eyes full of tears, and said, "Golden Zhuma, Golden Zhuma! If the Bodhisattva could restore my eyes, how wonderful it would be to see you!"

    藏族瞎妈妈盼来了解放军
    新华社记者  姜庆肇
    在西藏高原上，一位在牛棚里住了几十年的八十高龄的藏族瞎妈妈，现在搬进了人民解放军给她盖起的楼房里。给这位瞎妈妈盖房子的某连副连长吉星魁，最近从西藏来到北京，他在中国人民解放军后勤工作先进单位和积极分子代表会期间，向记者讲述了这件动人的事情。
    今年初夏的一天黑夜，吉星魁所在的连队追歼了一股散匪，驻扎在雪山下一个村庄里。全村一个人影也不见，但见门户洞开，牛羊乱跑，尽是满目凄凉的景象。连长潘长才和指导员周少銮马上吩咐战士们把群众的门户关好，把乱跑的牛羊牵进圈，割青草喂牛羊，等主人们回来好认领。
    战士们走近一座低矮、破烂的小土屋时，听见了老人的咳嗽声和小羊的咩叫声。他们立刻走进去，发现有三只奶牛、三只羊，屋角里坐着一位老妈妈，她衣衫褴褛、双目失明，满脸的皱纹显示她曾经经历过无限的苦难。战士们走过去，亲切地向老妈妈说：“阿妈，我们是解放军，您别害怕。”老妈妈抬起头，好久不作声，只是伸出双手抚摸着战士的面孔和帽徽，突然，她两只深陷的眼窝闪出了莹晶的泪花。一把拉住战士的手说：“金珠玛米！金珠玛米！你们可回来了！”
    “金珠玛米回来了！”瞎妈妈的呼声很快就传遍了山谷，在深山里逃避叛匪的藏民们络绎不绝地走回村庄。
    藏胞们见了解放军，纷纷拿出埋藏的酥油、奶渣、蜂蜜和核桃来欢迎。战士们谢绝了老乡的礼物，马上请他们去认领自己的牛羊。老乡们感动极了，他们悲喜交集，围在村头的草坪上，争相控诉叛匪的罪行。瞎妈妈在她儿媳和孙儿扎西的搀扶下，也倾诉了她满腹的苦水和仇恨……。
    九年前，人民解放军曾经到过这里，那时候，瞎妈妈还有着一对慈祥、明亮的眼睛。战士们天天给妈妈家背水、扫地，割草喂牛，还常常把自己的口粮节省下来，救济老妈妈和全村的贫苦人民。老妈妈多么疼爱这些毛主席派来的好军队啊！老妈妈的家是个奴隶家庭，在苦难重重的一生中，从来也没有感到这样的受人关怀和尊重。
    可是，没多久人民解放军就离开了。当地的反动奴隶主和匪徒们更加紧了对人民的迫害。老妈妈唯一的儿子被害死了，妈妈的眼睛也从此失去了光明。家里只剩下她和儿媳、孙儿扎西，无力为生，饥饿和灾难一天天噬嚼着她们的生命。从此，瞎妈妈就天天怀念着解放军，她祈求菩萨保佑：“金珠玛米”快回来，救救苦难的穷人！
    现在，“金珠玛米”果然回来了，消灭了叛匪，又为这个苦难的山村带来了温暖和光明。瞎妈妈紧紧拉住战士的手，流着眼泪恳求道：“金珠玛米！你们这次回来，可再不要离开你们的妈妈了。”
    连长、指导员和全连的战士们，一致向瞎妈妈表示：“坚决为藏族人民除害，保护和帮助西藏人民过自由幸福的日子”。
    战士们天天给瞎妈妈家背水、扫地，割草喂牛，并且把自己的口粮节省下来，救济瞎妈妈和全村的贫苦藏胞。这个连队还开办了一座铁匠炉，无偿地给藏胞打镰刀和锄头。担任铁匠的是入伍前在贵州安顺铁工厂当技工的青年战士张洪开和铁匠出身的战士李显明。藏胞们纷纷从几十里外背着破铁来要战士们给他们造农具。有些没有铁的农奴，战士们就用缴获叛匪的破马刀打成镰刀送给他们。这里的藏胞从此以铁农具代替了笨重的木器，个个喜笑颜开，感谢解放军。瞎妈妈把战士赠送的一把镰刀和一把锄头交给孙子扎西说：“孩子，你现在用金珠玛米给打的镰刀割草，将来就用锄头在田地上种青稞了。”
    十六岁的扎西聪明可爱，他要求战士们给他剪掉了两条小辫子，留起分头，并且穿上了工作队和战士们送给他的新绒衣、新鞋子，每天清早赶着牛羊到草地去放牧；傍晚，用镰刀割一背草，欢乐地赶着牛羊回家来。拴好牛，圈好羊，他又跑到连队去，同战士们一起学唱歌、跳舞，看画报和小人书，他和战士亲热得像兄弟一样。
    有一天，排长田珠玉和副排长黄士堂，向连首长提议：他们排的同志们愿意利用空隙时间，给瞎妈妈家盖一座新房子，让老人从牛棚搬进新居。连长同意了，他们当即跑到瞎妈妈家，同她一起选择地址和商量房屋的样式。弄得瞎妈妈惊喜万分，她甚至不敢相信这是真的！
    第二天，战士们便在村后的山坡上大兴土木。排长田珠玉担任了工程总指挥。他带领战士们起早睡晚，上山伐木，筑窑烧石灰。同时，平整地基，搬运石头，……在美丽的雪山脚下，荡漾着一片粗壮的劳动号子和欢乐的歌声。
    这件事惊动了全村的藏胞，他们开始只是新奇地来看热闹，后来许多人也被战士的劳动热情感动了，参加到建筑队伍里来。
    瞎妈妈一家人更是忙碌。扎西母子俩同战士们一起铲土、挑土，还为战士们烧茶送水。瞎妈妈拄着拐棍来到工地，一会儿拍拍战士的结实的肩膀，摸摸战士的满是汗水的脸；一会儿拉着排长田珠玉的手叨念道：“你们快休息吧，累坏了，我老妈妈是不愿意的。”
    战士们谁也不肯休息，越干劲越大。他们说：“阿妈！为了您老人家能早一天住上好房子，我们再累也不觉得累！”
    一连干了好几天，这座两层的小土木楼房眼看快要建成了，三排突然接到命令出发去执行新的任务。于是，盖房子的任务便落到二排战士的身上，二排长郭振乾和副连长吉星魁又率领着全排的战士，连续苦战了两天两夜，终于把楼房建成。
    这是一座美丽的小楼房，座北向南，窗户宽敞，楼房旁边还有一棵葱绿的大黑桃树，门前流过一条清澈的小溪。瞎妈妈请人选择了一个吉祥的日子，在全村人民和战士的祝福下，领着儿媳和孙子，离开黑暗的牛棚，迁入新居。当她走上楼房的时候，激动得用双手扒着眼睛，热泪满盈地说：“金珠玛米，金珠玛米！要是菩萨能赐还我眼睛，看看你们，该多好呀！”
