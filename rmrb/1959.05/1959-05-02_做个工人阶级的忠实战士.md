Be a Loyal Warrior of the Working Class
Cui Lianyu, Miner of Dexing Mine, Cijiang Province, Korea

"May Day" comes every year, but none has moved me as much as this year's "May Day." This year is the third year of our country's Five-Year Plan, and also the year to complete the Five-Year Plan.

I am a miner, the most basic mining worker in the mine. I completed my Five-Year Plan on February 5th. I used automatic tunneling machines to increase the tunneling speed several times compared to before. I resolved before the Party to complete 7.5 times the state plan during the Five-Year Plan period.

Some people celebrate my insignificant achievements, saying that I have created a miracle. However, I will never be complacent because of this.

I lost my parents when I was young. I don't even know what my parents looked like. In order to survive, I started working at the age of seven. Before liberation, I never slept under a quilt, never wore new clothes, and never wore leather shoes. But what is my life like today? After work, I put on silk clothes and skirts, and go to the club in leather shoes. I am also a member of the workers' entertainment group's choir!

All this happy life is inconceivable without the Party. Therefore, I have never refused the tasks assigned to me by the Party. As long as my heart is still beating, as long as it is working for the Party, I will go without hesitation.

In order to welcome "May Day," I will use automatic tunneling machines to increase the tunneling volume in May by 15% compared to April. Although this is a small matter, it can be regarded as a gift I offer to "May Day." My production increase struggle is still continuing. We must never slow down the "Chollima" speed because we have completed the Five-Year Plan.

I want to be a warrior loyal to the working class, and work tirelessly for our freedom and happiness. I am determined to be a loyal warrior of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the working class all over the world, and continue to struggle and move forward.

    做个工人阶级的忠实战士
    朝鲜慈江道德兴矿山矿工　崔莲玉
    “五一”节每年都有，可是，都没有像今年的“五一”节这样使我激动。今年是我国五年计划的第三年，同时又是完成五年计划的一年。
    我是矿山工人，是矿山工人中最基本的采矿工。我已经在2月5日完成了我的五年计划。我运用自动掘进机，使每个班的掘进速度比从前提高了几倍。我在党的面前决心要在五年计划期间完成国家计划的七点五倍。
    有的人庆祝我的微不足道的成绩，说我创造了奇迹。可是，我决不因此而自满。
    我从小就失去了父母。我连父母的面孔是什么样都不知道。我为了活下去，从七岁就开始劳动。我在解放以前没有盖过被子睡觉，没有穿过新衣服，也没有穿过皮鞋。然而，今天我的生活是什么样子呢？劳动完了就穿上绸衣绸裙，穿上皮鞋上俱乐部。我还是工人文娱小组的合唱团团员呢！
    这一切幸福生活离开党是不可设想的。因此，我从来没有拒绝过党所交给我的任务。只要我的心脏还在跳动，只要是为党工作，我将毫不犹豫地去作。
    为了迎接“五一”节，我要运用自动掘进机，使掘进量在5月份比4月份多15％。这虽然是件小事，也算是我献给“五一”节的礼物。我的增产斗争还在继续着。绝不能由于完成了五年计划而放慢
  “千里马”的速度。
    我要作一个忠于工人阶级的战士，为了我们的自由和幸福努力不懈。我决心做一个以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界工人阶级的忠实的战士，继续斗争，不断前进。
