    Aidit Speaks at Party Anniversary Celebration
    Calls for Strengthening the Party's Ideological Construction
    A mass rally celebrating the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party was held in Jakarta on the evening of the 24th. Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit, in his speech at the rally, pointed out that for thirty-nine years, the Indonesian Communist Party has been brutally ravaged by imperialism and domestic reactionaries, but it has still achieved rapid development. He also pointed out that the current international situation is very favorable to communist parties in all countries.
    In his speech, Aidit pointed out the possibility of launching an armed coup d'état to establish a military dictatorship in Indonesia. He said that as long as imperialism headed by the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization still exist, the Indonesian Communist Party cannot believe that the possibility of launching an armed coup d'état to establish a reactionary military dictatorship does not exist. He also said that we must stop military dictatorship, because it will bring disaster to the Indonesian people and hinder the inevitable progress of the world.
    Aidit also said that the Indonesian Communist Party is loyal to patriotism and proletarian internationalism. Therefore, the unity between the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people and the world workers' movement is growing stronger.
    Referring to the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party, which is scheduled to be held later this year, Aidit said that this is a congress to strengthen the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian National United Front, and the struggle for world peace. The Indonesian working people will welcome it with various actions.
    Aidit called on all cadres within the party to study Marxist-Leninist philosophy in order to strengthen the party's ideological construction. Aidit pointed out that imperialism and its lackeys in Indonesia, as well as domestic bourgeois elements, are vigorously attacking the philosophical fortress of the working class defended by the Indonesian Communist Party. He also criticized the Yugoslav revisionists for their praise of capitalism and American monopoly capital.

    艾地在庆祝党的生日时讲话
    号召加强党的思想建设
    庆祝印度尼西亚共产党成立三十九周年的群众大会24日晚间在雅加达举行。印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在大会上讲话时指出，三十九年来，印度尼西亚共产党一直遭受着帝国主义和国内反动派的野蛮蹂躏，但是它还是取得了迅速的发展。他还指出，目前的国际形势对各国共产党都是十分有利的。
  艾地在讲话中指出了在印度尼西亚存在着发动武装政变来建立军事独裁的可能性。他说，只要以美国为首的帝国主义和东南亚条约组织还存在着，印度尼西亚共产党就不能认为发动武装政变以建立反动的军事独裁的可能性不存在了。他又说，我们要阻止军事独裁，因为它将给印度尼西亚人民带来灾难，并且阻碍世界的不可避免的进步。
    艾地还说，印度尼西亚共产党忠于爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义。因此，印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民和世界工人运动之间的团结日益加强。
    在谈到订于今年内召开的印度尼西亚共产党第六次全国代表大会时，艾地说，这是一次加强印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚民族统一战线和争取世界和平的代表大会。印度尼西亚劳动人民将以各种行动来欢迎它。
    艾地号召党内所有干部学习马克思列宁主义哲学，以便加强党的思想建设。艾地指出，帝国主义和它在印度尼西亚的走狗以及国内的资产阶级分子十分起劲地攻击印度尼西亚共产党所保卫的工人阶级的哲学堡垒。他还抨击了南斯拉夫修正主义者对资本主义和美国的垄断资本的赞扬。
