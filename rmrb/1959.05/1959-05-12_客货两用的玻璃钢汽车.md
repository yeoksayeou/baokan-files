    Fiberglass Automobile for Both Passengers and Cargo
    The Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory and the Shenyang Automobile Repair Factory have recently jointly trial-produced a passenger-and-cargo micro fiberglass automobile – "Qunying No. 1".
    This automobile has a novel and beautiful appearance. Except for the engine, axles, and steel plate tires which are metal, all other parts such as the chassis wing panels, bumpers, and car body are made of fiberglass. There are two rows of seats inside, seating four people (including the driver). The total weight of the car body is 200 kilograms, only one-third of the weight of a steel plate car body. Due to the light body and flexible handling, fuel consumption is also low. It can carry half a ton on flat roads, with a maximum speed of 35 kilometers per hour. (Gai Tailai) (Attached picture)

    客货两用的玻璃钢汽车
    沈阳市玻璃仪器厂与沈阳市汽车修配厂合作，最近试制成功一种客货两用微型玻璃钢汽车——“群英一号”。
    这种汽车样式新颖、美观大方，除发动机、轮轴和轮胎钢板是金属外，其他如底盘翼板、保险杠、车箱等全部是用玻璃钢制成。车内有两排座位，可坐四人（连司机）。车身总重二百公斤，仅为钢板车身重量的三分之一。由于车身轻巧，行驶灵活，耗油量也少。它在平坦路上行驶，可以载重半吨，最大时速为三十五公里。　（盖太来）（附图片）
