I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the work report of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

I was very excited to hear Premier Zhou's Government Work Report. This report comprehensively summarized the achievements of China's first Five-Year Plan, especially the achievements and experiences of China's Great Leap Forward last year. At the same time, it put forward the grand plan for China's economic construction in 1959. Like everyone else, I feel extremely happy and encouraged. These achievements and plans are extremely brilliant and mark 1958 as a year of rapid advancement in China's vigorous development of the national economy. The output of steel, iron, coal, and grain has increased several times, which is unprecedented and unimaginable in the capitalist world. 1959 will be another year of greater leap forward in China's development of the national economy, and greater efforts must be made to first complete and over fulfill the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

I am an engineering and technical personnel in highway construction. Now I will give a brief speech on the leap forward in highway work in 1958.

In 1958, due to the great development of agricultural production, the rapid advancement of industrial construction, and the blooming of local industries everywhere, new tasks were put forward for transportation. Especially after the nationwide steelmaking campaign, it brought about a more tense transportation situation. Highway transportation spread to every corner of the country, reflecting a particularly urgent need for highway construction and highway transportation. The tasks completed by the Ministry of Communications in highway construction and highway transportation, like other aspects, have also greatly leaped forward and achieved unprecedented victories.

First, in terms of highway construction, when the country was liberated, the Kuomintang reactionaries left behind only 75,000 kilometers of highways open to traffic nationwide; most of them were built simply without standards, and many were repaired and improved after liberation. By the end of the first Five-Year Plan, the total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide reached more than 250,000 kilometers; among them, more than 180,000 kilometers were newly built according to certain standards. Although the achievements were significant, they still could not meet the requirements of all aspects. In the first half of 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line, the Ministry of Communications timely put forward the "Local, Mass, and Universal" policy. Specifically, for highway construction, it is necessary to: rely on the localities, rely on the masses, and popularize and improve, so that all the directly affiliated teams of highway construction were transferred to lower levels and directly led by the Party committees at all levels. With the large-scale steel transportation, the Party committees took the lead, forming a situation in which the whole Party and the whole people ran transportation, changing the past situation of mainly relying on directly affiliated teams to handle affairs. According to the above policy, everyone further clarified that the strength of the masses is the source of developing China's highway construction, and adopted the method of combining professional teams with the broad masses; that is, specifically embodying the Party's mass line on the transportation front. Under urgent circumstances, the Party's policies were correctly implemented, so that last year, the mileage of highways built by a province or autonomous region exceeded 10,000 kilometers in many cases. The masses participated in road construction with unprecedented enthusiasm: In Henan Province, after a transportation radio conference was listened to by more than 8.2 million people, it immediately set off a high tide of large-scale highway construction. In 24 days, the number of people invested in road construction reached more than 13 million workdays, and more than 6,000 kilometers of highways were newly built and rebuilt. Hunan Province organized a road construction army of 600,000 people, and in one month, the construction of more than 11,000 kilometers of highways was started. In Shandong Province, the number of people participating in road construction in September last year reached 3.52 million, and nearly 4,000 kilometers of highways were newly built and rebuilt. In addition, a large number of cart roads, sidewalks, pack animal paths, bamboo and wood tracks, small railways, cableways, slides, and chutes were also built. Some were called "Huang Zhong Road," "Youth Road," "March 8th Road," "Mu Guiying Road," and "Young Pioneers Road." This shows that under the call of the whole Party and the whole people running transportation, regardless of men, women, old or young, everyone was of one mind, actively implementing the Party's policies, and enthusiastically participating in road construction, creating conditions for highway transportation. The heroic deeds in this regard are endless. In old China, highway construction became a tool for the reactionary rulers to oppress and exploit the people; while the people's highways are for the people's own benefit, and it is no accident that the broad masses enthusiastically build and maintain roads.

Correctly implementing the Party's policies, highway construction in 1958 developed by leaps and bounds; the total mileage of newly built highways throughout the year reached more than 150,000 kilometers. In order to meet transportation needs, nearly 60,000 kilometers of existing highways were rebuilt. The achievements in one year are equivalent to more than twice the total mileage of highways built in the thirty years before liberation. The mileage of newly built and rebuilt highways also exceeded the total mileage of newly built highways in the eight years after liberation. By the end of last year, the total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide exceeded 400,000 kilometers, and the highway networks in many counties have been basically formed. Needless to say, the construction of these roads is playing an active role in developing the national economy and transportation, especially for the steel marshal's ascension to the throne.

Under the guidance of the policy of walking on two legs, highway transportation implements: both modern transportation tools and folk transportation tools, both public transportation tools and self-used transportation tools of communes, factories and mines, and the combination of trunk line transportation and branch line transportation, and the combination of transportation by professional departments and transportation by the broad masses and all walks of life. After studying Premier's report, it should be specially pointed out here that it is of great significance to systematically carry out transportation by the people's communes and widely use folk transportation tools to organize short-distance transportation on the highway transportation front. In highway construction, both surveying and construction also reflect the policy of walking on two legs, that is, the combination of professional teams and the broad masses.

Under the impetus of the call for vigorously carrying out the technical revolution and practicing increasing production and practicing economy, highway transportation implements: motor vehicles pulling trailers, making full use of substitute materials to build trailers, improving folk transportation tools, improving loading and unloading organizations and loading and unloading equipment, and promoting the advanced vehicle maintenance experience of "no more than one day for major repairs and no more than time for secondary maintenance." Without emphasizing the increase in equipment, the transportation capacity is doubled. The monthly output of automobile ton-kilometers increased by an average of 18.2 percent per year during the first Five-Year Plan, and leaped to 43 percent last year. In highway construction, the first thing to do is to study and revise highway technical standards to make them suitable for trailer transportation. Surveying work has created a set of rapid design methods, which greatly speeds up the surveying speed while ensuring quality. Xinxiang Prefecture in Henan Province once had a record of one team measuring 27 kilometers a day. In highway engineering, due to the continuous technical revolution, labor productivity is constantly improving. Research work focuses on solving the problem of pavement materials in areas without sand and the technical problems related to the motor vehicle train. Certain results have been achieved. Due to the construction of bridges instead of ferries, the large-scale repair of the Grand Canal, and road construction in river network areas, many large-span bridge projects have been brought about, all of which are being researched and carried out based on the principle of local materials. Due to the liberation of the mind, Guizhou Province used small timber and iron nails to build a 30-meter span highway wooden bridge, and many provinces are building large stone arch bridges with spans of 40, 50, and 60 meters, which were unimaginable in the past. Facts have proved that to vigorously carry out the technical revolution, we must first thoroughly liberate our minds. It is difficult for people with conservative ideas to achieve results.

All of this is under the guidance of the Party's correct policies, with politics in command, and the Party committees at all levels grasping both transportation and transportation construction, mobilizing and organizing the masses to advance side by side, and completing the arduous tasks of highway construction and highway transportation in 1958. Now we have deeply realized that it is only possible to do a good job and complete the task if we put politics in command and thoroughly and conscientiously implement the Party's policies.

The highway tasks facing us in 1959 are even more arduous. As long as we conscientiously study, implement, and carry out the Party's policies, rally more closely around the Party, put politics in command, go all out, and actively engage in the wave centered on the technical revolution and aimed at increasing production and practicing economy, any arduous task can be successfully completed.

　　四通八达
    丁贡南委员的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告、李富春和李先念两位副总理的报告、彭真副委员长的报告和政协李维汉副主席所作关于第二届全国政协常委会的工作报告。
    我非常兴奋地听到周总理的政府工作报告。这个报告全面总结了我国第一个五年计划的成就，特别是去年我国大跃进的成就和经验，同时提出了我国一九五九年的经济建设的宏伟计划。我同大家一样，感到无比的欢欣和鼓舞。这些成就和计划，是极其辉煌灿烂的，标志着一九五八年是我国在大力发展国民经济的过程中飞跃前进的一年。钢、铁、煤、粮的产量加番，史无前例，在资本主义世界里是不可想像的。一九五九年又是我国发展国民经济更大跃进的一年，要作出更大的努力，首先完成和超额完成钢、煤、粮、棉的四大指标。
    我是公路建设工作中的一个工程技术人员，现就一九五八年公路工作的跃进情况，作一概略的发言。
    一九五八年，由于农业生产大发展，工业建设突飞猛进，地方工业遍地开花，给交通运输提出了新的任务。特别是全民炼钢以后，带来了更为紧张的运输形势。公路运输遍布全国各个角落，反映到对公路建设和公路运输的需要上特别紧张。交通部在公路建设和公路运输方面完成的任务和其他方面一样，也是大大地跃进，空前的胜利。
    先就公路建设来说，全国解放时，国民党反动派遗留下来的全国公路通车里程仅仅七万五千公里；多半是修筑简陋漫无标准，有许多在解放后都加了修复和改善。到第一个五年计划末，全国共有公路通车里程达到二十五万余公里；其中按照一定标准新建了十八万余公里，成绩虽然显著，但还不能满足各方面的要求。一九五八年上半年在总路线的光辉照耀下，交通部及时提出：“地、群、普”方针。具体到公路建设上要：依靠地方、依靠群众、普及提高，从而将公路建设的直属队伍全部下放，由各级党委直接领导。随着大搞钢铁运输的同时，由党委挂帅，形成全党全民办交通，改变了过去主要靠直属队伍办事的局面。根据上述方针，大家进一步明确了群众的力量，是发展我国公路建设的泉源，采取专业队伍与广大群众相结合的办法；也就是在交通战线上具体体现了党的群众路线。在迫切需要的情况下，正确地贯彻了党的方针政策，因而去年一年，一个省或自治区修建的公路里程，很多超过了一万公里。群众参加筑路，盛况空前：河南省有一次交通运输广播大会有八百二十多万人收听以后，立即掀起大搞公路建设的高潮，在二十四天的时间里，投入筑路的大军，达一千三百多万工日，新建和改建了公路六千余公里。湖南省组织六十万人的筑路大军，在一个月里，动工修建的公路有一万一千多公里。山东省去年九月参加筑路的人数达三百五十二万人，新建和改建公路将近四千公里。此外，还大量修建了大车道、人行道、驮马道、竹木轨道、小铁道、索道、滑道、溜槽等等，有的叫：“黄忠路”、“青年路”、“三八路”、“穆桂英路”、“少先路”，这说明在全党全民办交通的号召下，无分男女老少，都是万众一心积极贯彻执行党的政策，踊跃参加筑路，为公路运输创造条件，其中的英雄事迹，是说不完的。旧中国修建公路，成为反动统治者压迫和剥削人民的工具；而人民公路，是为人民自己谋福利，广大群众热情修路、养路不是偶然的。
    正确地执行党的政策，一九五八年公路建设是飞跃发展的；全年新建公路达十五万余公里。为了符合运输需要，改建原有公路将近六万公里，一年的成绩，相当于解放前三十多年间修建公路里程总和的一倍多。新建与改建的里程也超过了解放后八年新建的总和。到去年底，全国公路通车里程，超过四十万公里，有许多县的公路网，已基本构成。这些道路的修建，对发展国民经济运输，尤其为钢铁元帅升帐，不用说，是起着积极作用的。
    在用两条腿走路的方针指导下，公路运输实行：近代运输工具和民间运输工具并举，公用运输工具和公社、厂矿自用的运输工具并举，干线运输和支线运输相结合，专业部门办运输和广大群众各行各业办运输相结合。学习总理的报告以后，在此要特别提出的：在公路运输战线上有计划地开展人民公社办运输和广泛地利用民间运输工具组织短途运输有它的重要意义。公路修建中，无论测设施工，也体现了两条腿走路的方针，即专业队伍与广大群众相结合。
    在大闹技术革命和厉行增产节约的号召推动下，公路运输实行：汽车拖挂列车化，尽量采取代用材料大造挂车、改进民间运输工具、改进装卸组织和装卸设备，推行：“大修不过日，二保不过时”先进的车辆保修经验。在不强调增加设备的前提下，使运力加番。汽车车吨月产量，在第一个五年计划期间，平均每年增长百分之十八点二，去年一跃而为百分之四十三。在公路修建方面，首先研究修改公路技术标准，使之适合于拖挂运输。测设工作，创造了一套快速设计法，在保证质量的前提下，大大加快了测设速度。河南省新乡专区曾出现一个队一天测量二十七公里的纪录。在公路工程中由于不断地进行技术革命，劳动生产率都在不断地提高。关于研究工作，着重解决无砂料地区的路面材料问题和汽车列车化一系列的有关技术问题，已取得一定的成果。由于改渡建桥、大修运河以及河网化地区的筑路，带来许许多多大跨径的大桥工程，都在本着就地取材的原则，研究进行。由于思想解放，贵州省用小木材加铁钉修建起三十公尺跨径的公路木桥，有许多省正在修建四十、五十、六十公尺跨径的大石拱桥，这都是过去不敢设想的。事实证明，大闹技术革命，首先必须彻底解放思想，有保守思想的人，是很难做出成绩的。
    这一切，都在党的正确的方针指导下，以政治挂帅、各级党委既抓运输又抓交通建设，发动组织群众齐头并进，完成了一九五八年的公路建设和公路运输的艰巨任务。现在我们已经深刻地认识到，必须以政治挂帅，深入认真贯彻党的方针政策才有可能做好工作，完成任务。
    一九五九年摆在我们面前的公路任务更加艰巨，只要我们认真地学习、贯彻、执行党的政策，更加紧密地围绕在党的周围，以政治挂帅、鼓足干劲，积极投入以技术革命为中心，以增产节约为目的的浪潮中去，任何艰巨的任务，都是能够胜利完成的。
