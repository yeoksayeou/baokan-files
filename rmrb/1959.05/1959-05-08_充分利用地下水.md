　　Make Full Use of Groundwater
　　*People's Daily* Commentator
　　Water comes from the sky, the ground, and underground. We must strive to make full use of all these water sources. Developing and utilizing underground water sources is an important aspect of water conservancy construction. Over the past few years, the development and utilization of groundwater has achieved great success. By the end of 1958, the area irrigated by groundwater nationwide had expanded to over 290 million mu, equivalent to 18 times the 15.8 million mu of well-irrigated land before liberation, playing a significant role in last year's bumper harvest in agriculture.

　　While China's surface water resources are indeed abundant, according to recent statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, there are still over 200 million mu of cultivated land and approximately 1 billion mu of pastoral grassland nationwide that lack surface water, necessitating reliance on groundwater to solve irrigation and human and livestock drinking water problems. Among the existing over 700 million mu of surface water irrigation areas nationwide, a considerable portion has a low irrigation guarantee rate, requiring the comprehensive development and utilization of both surface and groundwater simultaneously. In mountainous, semi-mountainous, and a few plain areas, nearly 10 million people still face drinking water difficulties, requiring the storage of rainwater and the development of groundwater to solve the problem.

　　Can the development and utilization of groundwater completely solve the irrigation of cultivated land and pastoral grassland, as well as the drinking water needs of humans and livestock, as mentioned above? According to preliminary understanding, the reserves of groundwater that can be developed are very abundant, fully capable of meeting the needs of irrigation and human and livestock drinking. Moreover, in most areas, groundwater is not deeply buried, generally within 100 meters, except in a few regions. Some are very shallow, practically "a shovel becomes a well," "a horse's hoof becomes a spring." Over 200 counties nationwide, covering an area of approximately 250,000 square kilometers, have abundant artesian water underground, which, once developed, can be transformed into surface artesian water. Experience over the past few years has proven that we have the means to develop underground water resources.

　　The "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production has taken deep root in people's hearts, and people increasingly recognize that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture" and the value of groundwater. Farmers in Henan call well-digging "building granaries," while farmers in Liaoning call water wells "treasure gates." In recent years, well-irrigated areas have resisted the threat of drought and achieved bumper harvests year after year, greatly enhancing people's belief in the power of human determination to overcome nature and changing the centuries-old mindset of relying on the heavens for food. This has laid the ideological foundation for future groundwater development work. Over the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people have become increasingly familiar with the natural laws and topographical conditions of groundwater in the process of developing it, creating a relatively complete set of experiences in groundwater development. These experiences can be summarized in six characters: "Deep, Flow, Store, Many, Combine, Manage." Deep means developing and utilizing deep-seated groundwater to increase the irrigation guarantee rate. Flow means utilizing the natural pressure of groundwater, through artificial development, to transform it into surface artesian water, developing artesian irrigation. Store means controlling and storing groundwater and artesian water at ordinary times to increase water volume and utilization rate. Many means developing in various ways according to local conditions to increase the income of the state and the people. Combine means comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization, rational development, and rational utilization to serve the all-round great leap forward of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Manage means emphasizing both construction and management, building well in one place and using it well, strengthening engineering maintenance and management. Adopting these experiences can achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Construction can be completed and benefits realized in the same year, and the technology is not very complex. Farmers can handle it themselves after short-term training, with little state investment. The investment per mu of irrigated land is generally only a few dimes to two or three yuan. Over the past few years, a group of both red and expert water conservancy cadres and technicians have been cultivated and trained, and over 80,000 sets of advanced manual and mechanical power well-drilling and deep-well tools have been created and promoted. In the future, as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, make good use of these existing experiences and favorable conditions, strengthen technical guidance, and cultivate more technical forces, it is possible to complete mechanization of wells and develop all possible usable underground artesian water within two or three years or a slightly longer period, except in some pastoral areas.

　　The current central task of developing and utilizing groundwater is to ensure the timely and appropriate supply of water for the fields. In order to ensure a bumper harvest in summer and autumn, all localities must strengthen the management and use of existing groundwater projects, put all existing water-lifting tools into use, and give full play to the benefits of the projects. If there are insufficient water-lifting tools, it is necessary to rely on the masses to quickly produce simple water-lifting tools. If there is insufficient fuel for mechanical power, it is necessary to find alternative fuels locally. If irrigation canal systems have not been built, they should be gradually constructed from simple to complex, from incomplete to complete, according to the needs of agricultural production and the availability of labor. In short, we must do everything possible to give full play to the role of groundwater in increasing agricultural production.

　　充分利用地下水
　　本报评论员
    水，有天上的、地面的、地下的几种。对于这几种水源，都要力求充分利用。开发利用地下水源是水利建设的一个重要方面。几年来，地下水的开发利用已经取得巨大成就。到1958年底为止，全国利用地下水灌溉的面积已扩大到二亿九千多万亩，相当于解放前井灌面积一千五百八十万亩的十八倍，对去年农业的大丰收起了很大的作用。
    我国地面水源固然丰富，但据农业部最近统计，全国还有二亿多亩耕地和十亿亩左右的牧区草场缺乏地面水，需要依靠地下水解决灌溉和人畜饮水问题。全国现有七亿多亩地面水灌区，其中有相当一部分灌溉保证率偏低，必须地上水和地下水综合开发同时利用。在山区、半山区和少数平原地区，还有近千万人口饮水困难，需要蓄存天上落下来的水和开发地下水来解决饮水问题。
    开发利用地下水是否能够彻底解决以上所说耕地和牧区草地的灌溉以及人、畜饮水的水源问题呢？据初步了解，能够开发出来的地下水蕴藏量非常丰富，完全能够满足灌溉和人、畜饮用的需要。而且，绝大部分地区的地下水埋藏不深，除个别地区外，一般都在一百公尺以内。有的很浅，简直就是“一锨成井”，“马踢成泉”。全国有二百多个县约二十五万平方公里面积的地下有丰富的自流水，只要开发出来，就能变成地面自流水。几年来的经验证明，我们完全有办法把地下水利资源开发出来。
    农业生产“八字宪法”已经深入人心，人们愈来愈认识到“水利是农业的命脉”，认识到地下水的可贵。河南的农民称打井为“修粮仓”，辽宁的农民称水井为“宝库门”。近几年来井灌地区抵抗了旱灾威胁，年年丰收，极大地增强了人们人定胜天的信念，改变了几千年来靠天吃饭的思想。这就给今后开发地下水工作奠定了思想基础。几年来，广大人民在党的正确领导下，在开发地下水工作中，日益熟悉了地下水的自然规律和地形条件，创造了一套较完整的开发地下水的经验。这些经验可以用“深、流、蓄、多、合、管”六个字来说明：深，就是开发利用深层地下水，提高灌溉保证率。流，就是利用地下水的自然压力，通过人工开发，把它变成地面自流水，发展自流灌溉。蓄，就是在平时把地下水、自流水控制起来，积蓄起来，以增加水量和利用率。多，就是因地制宜，多种多样开发，增加国家和人民的收入。合，就是综合开发，综合利用，合理开发，合理利用，为农、林、牧、副、渔全线大跃进服务。管，就是修、管并重，修好一处，用好一处，加强工程维护管理。采用这些经验，就可以多、快、好、省。当年施工，当年受益，技术性不很复杂。农民经过短期训练就可以自己举办，很少用国家投资。每亩灌溉面积投资一般只要几角到二、三元钱。几年来，已经培养和锻炼出一批又红又专的水利干部和技术工人，并且创造和推广了八万多部先进的人力和机械动力打机井、深井工具。今后只要加强党的领导，很好地运用已有的这些经验和有利条件，加强技术指导，培养更多的技术力量，除部分牧区外，有可能在两三年或者稍长一点的时间内完成机井化，把一切可能利用的地下自流水开发出来。
    当前开发利用地下水的中心任务，是保证适时、适量地供给田间用水。为了保证夏季和秋季的大丰收，各地要加强对现有地下水工程的管理使用，把现有的提水工具统统使用起来，充分发挥工程效益。提水工具不足的要依靠群众迅速赶制简易提水工具，机械动力所需燃料不足的要就地找代用燃料，没有修建灌水渠系的要根据农业生产的需要和劳力的可能，由简到繁，由不完整到完整，逐步修建灌水工程。总之，要千方百计力求充分发挥地下水对农业增产的作用。
