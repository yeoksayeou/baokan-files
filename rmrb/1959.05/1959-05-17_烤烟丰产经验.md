Experience in High-Yielding Flue-Cured Tobacco
Ministry of Agriculture, Economic Crops Bureau

In 1958, the nation witnessed large-scale, high-yield records for flue-cured tobacco. While achieving these high yields, many tobacco-producing areas also explored a set of experiences for high production. Learning and promoting these experiences will help various regions strive for even greater tobacco harvests this year.

Tobacco Fields Also Need Deep Plowing

According to observations by the Tobacco Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences: tobacco roots can extend as deep as 122 centimeters and as wide as 136 centimeters in the soil layer. The main root system is distributed within the range of 70 to 80 centimeters. An investigation in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, revealed that tobacco fields plowed to a depth of one chi (foot) yielded 16.4% more than those plowed to seven cun (inches); those plowed to a depth of two and a half chi yielded 27.9% more than those plowed to eight cun. This fact powerfully refutes the outdated view of bourgeois scholars that tobacco is a shallow-rooted crop.

Increase the Total Number of Leaves

In the past, it was generally believed that if the yield of flue-cured tobacco exceeded 500 or 600 jin (pounds) per mu (acre), the quality of the tobacco leaves would decrease. There was particular concern about using increased fertilization to improve yield. The production practice in 1958 broke this argument. In the past, the guiding ideology of tobacco cultivation focused only on a few leaves on the main stem. Therefore, increased fertilization often resulted in coarse veins and stalks, thick tissues, spicy taste, and reduced quality of tobacco leaves. However, in 1958, various regions adopted reasonable close planting and the cultivation of branch tobacco (chā yān) measures based on deep plowing, increased fertilization, and increased irrigation, greatly increasing the total number of leaves per mu of tobacco field. The situation changed, and the problem of excessive fertilization affecting the quality of flue-cured tobacco no longer existed.

To increase the total number of leaves per unit, it is first necessary to ensure that there are enough plants per mu. The high-yield experience in Xuchang and other counties in Henan Province is that it is generally appropriate to plant 2,000 to 2,500 tobacco plants per mu. Overcrowding results in poor ventilation and light transmission in the tobacco field; sparse planting fails to make full use of land fertility and space, both of which are detrimental to increased production. As for dense planting methods, judging from last year's experience, wide and narrow rows (enlarging the wide rows, reducing the narrow rows and plant spacing) and wide-row dense planting (widening row spacing, reducing plant spacing) are more appropriate.

Cultivating branch tobacco is the most effective way to increase the number of leaves per mu. According to the high-yield test of the Tobacco Research Institute in 1958, the number of branch leaves is 2.8 to 3.3 times that of the main stem leaves, accounting for about 40% of the total yield. Therefore, to create high yields, it is necessary to cultivate branch tobacco. Cultivating branch tobacco should be based on the premise that the tobacco plants are growing vigorously. The reason is very simple: a strong mother makes a fat child. However, the position of retaining branches (liú chā) differs between early and late tobacco. Early tobacco is harvested and cured early, and the growth period of branch tobacco is long. Generally, both "bayonet" (retaining the top branches) and retaining two stubbles (retaining the bottom branches) can be carried out simultaneously. Late tobacco is harvested and cured later, and the growth period of branch tobacco is relatively short, so it is advisable to retain the "bayonet". After rational retaining branches, as long as attention is paid to timely topping, sucker removal, and increased fertilization of branch tobacco, the quality of branch tobacco can be greatly improved. The claim that cultivating branch tobacco affects the quality of tobacco leaves is also unfounded.

Apply Heavy Base Fertilizer and Early Topdressing

According to typical surveys of high-yield fields in various regions last year, the minimum amount of base fertilizer applied per mu was over 30,000 jin. Farm manure has a long-lasting fertilizer effect and is a complete fertilizer that can continuously meet the needs of tobacco at different growth stages. Therefore, applying heavy base fertilizer is the foundation of high yield. According to the Tobacco Research Institute's experiments: During the tobacco growth period, the greatest fertilizer demand is within 20 days before and after topping, accounting for about 45%-62% of the total fertilizer demand. Therefore, topdressing must be carried out in stages within 30 days after transplanting. Late tobacco grows faster due to the high temperature after transplanting, so it is better to finish topdressing within 25 days after transplanting.

Seize the Opportunity to Irrigate

In order to give full play to fertilizer efficiency and strive for a bumper harvest, it is also necessary to break the erroneous view that "tobacco is not afraid of drought". The existence of this view is the main reason why the drought resistance of tobacco fields has been neglected in previous years, which seriously affected the growth and development of tobacco plants and caused the so-called "early flowering" phenomenon. Old farmers' experience: tobacco fields must be irrigated during the seven growth stages of tobacco seedling establishment (transplanting), recovery (five to eight days after transplanting), root extension (eight to fifteen days after transplanting), vigorous growth (twenty to thirty days after transplanting), topping (i.e. topping), flat topping (i.e. top expansion period), and retaining branches, in order to ensure high yield and high quality of tobacco leaves. The amount of water for each irrigation should be increased or decreased according to the principles of observing the weather, the soil, and the tobacco.

Early Planting, Early Harvesting, Early Curing

Early planting can improve the survival rate of transplanting, prolong the field growth period of tobacco, and allow the tobacco leaves to grow and mature fully, which is of particular importance to the increased production of late tobacco. At the same time, early planting can create conditions for early harvesting, early curing, and cultivating branch tobacco. Last year, the early tobacco transplanted in late April in Henan not only staggered the management work of topdressing, irrigation, and soil cultivation in tobacco fields with the busy farming season before and after wheat harvest, improving the quality of management work, but also basically completed the harvesting and curing of main stem leaves in mid-August, extending the growth period of the second stubble tobacco to more than 60 days, ensuring a bumper harvest. It can be seen that early planting, early harvesting, and early curing are interrelated. If one link is not done well, it will affect the implementation of other yield-increasing technologies.

    烤烟丰产经验
    农业部经济作物局
    1958年全国烤烟出现了大面积的高额丰产纪录。许多烤烟产区，在创造这些高产纪录的同时，还摸索出一套丰产经验，学习和推广这些经验，将有助于各地争取今年烤烟更大的丰收。
    烟田也要深耕
    据中国农业科学院烟草研究所的观测：烟草根系在土层中的分布最深达到一百二十二厘米，宽达一百三十六厘米。主要根群分布在七十到八十厘米范围以内。河南襄城县的调查：烟田深耕一尺的，比耕七寸的增产16.4％；深耕二尺半的，比耕八寸的增产27.9％。这个事实有力地驳倒了资产阶级学者的烟草为浅根作物的陈腐观点。
    增加总叶片数
    过去一般认为烤烟每亩产量超过五、六百斤，就会降低烟叶品质。特别对用增施肥料来提高产量有很大顾虑。1958年的生产实践打破了这个论点。由于过去烤烟栽培的指导思想只是在主茎上的几个叶片做文章，因而增施肥料后往往造成烟叶的粗筋暴梗，组织粗厚，烟味辛辣，品质降低。而1958年各地在深耕、增肥、增水的基础上采取了合理密植和培育杈烟的措施，大大增多了每亩烟田的总叶片数。情况改变了，多施肥会影响烤烟品质的问题就不存在了。
    增加单位总叶片数，首先要保证每亩有足够的株数。河南省许昌等县的丰产经验是每亩植烟一般以二千到二千五百株为宜。过密，烟田的通风透光不良；过稀，不能充分利用地力和空间，都对增产不利。至于密植方式，从去年经验看，以宽窄行（放大宽行，缩小窄行和株距）和宽行密植（放宽行距，缩小株距）较为适当。
    培育杈烟是增加每亩叶片数最有效的方法。据1958年烟草研究所的丰产试验，杈叶为主茎叶数的二点八到三点三倍，占总产量的40％左右。因此创造高产，必须培育杈烟。培育杈烟应以烟株生长健旺为前提，道理很简单，就是母大儿肥。但是早、晚烟的留杈部位有所不同。早烟收烤得早，杈烟的生长期长，一般可以挂“刺刀”（即留顶杈）和留二茬（即留底杈）并举；而晚烟收烤较迟，杈烟生长期较短，以留“刺刀”为宜。在合理留杈后只要注意杈烟的及时打顶、抹杈和增施肥料，杈烟的质量就可以大大提高。培育杈烟影响烟叶质量的说法也是没有根据的。
    重施基肥、早施追肥
    根据去年各地丰产田的典型调查，每亩基肥施用量最少的在三万斤以上。农家肥料的肥效持久，而且为完全肥料，能不断满足烟草不同生长阶段对肥料的需要，因此重施基肥是丰产的基础。另根据烟草研究所的试验：烟草生育期间，以打顶前、后的二十天需肥量最大，约为全部需肥量的45％—62％。因此必须提早在移栽后的三十天以内分次进行追肥。晚烟由于移栽后气温高，生长较快，以提前在移栽后的二十五天以内结束追肥较好。
    抓住时机进行灌溉
    为了充分发挥肥效，争取丰收，还必须破除“烟草不怕旱”的错误观点。因为这一观点的存在，是往年忽视烟田抗旱，而严重影响烟株生长发育，造成所谓“早花”现象的主要原因之一。老农经验：烟田浇水必须抓住烟草的定根（移栽时）、还苗（栽后五—八天）、伸根（栽后八—十五天）、旺长（栽后二十—三十天）、摘心（即打顶）、平顶（即顶伸张期）及留杈等七个生长阶段进行，才能保证烟叶的高产优质。每次浇水量，应根据看天、看地、看烟的原则酌量增减。
    早栽、早收、早烤
    早栽可以提高移栽成活率，延长烟草大田生长期，使烟叶能够充分生长成熟，这对晚烟的增产也有特别重要的意义。同时早栽又可以为早收、早烤和培育杈烟创造条件。去年河南在4月下旬移栽的早烟，不仅使烟田的追肥、灌溉、培土等管理工作和麦收前后的农忙季节错开，提高了管理工作的质量，而且在8月中旬，就基本上将主茎叶片收烤完毕，使二茬烟的生长期延长到六十天以上，保证了丰收。由此可见，早栽、早收、早烤三者是互相关联，一环作不好，就影响其他增产技术的执行。（附图片）
