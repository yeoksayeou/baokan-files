    Zhang Sizhou, the head of the Cotton Harvest Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan, is a cotton production expert. Since 1951, he has been named a labor model every year and has attended the National Conference of Advanced Agricultural Producers in Beijing twice. Therefore, people affectionately call him "Old Model Worker" when they meet him.

    Zhang Sizhou's work went relatively smoothly in the first few years. Relying on his old experience, he led everyone to work diligently and conscientiously, advancing step by step from mutual aid teams to elementary agricultural cooperatives, with increasing production year after year. This cotton-producing area, known for its barren land, saw its cotton yield per mu increase from fourteen jin (seed cotton, same below) in 1951 to forty-six jin in 1955.

    Relying solely on old experience was no longer enough
    In 1956, advanced agricultural cooperatives were established, and the strength of the cooperative became even stronger, and the enthusiasm of the members was even greater. The work of plowing, fertilizing, and pest control in the cotton fields was done more carefully and thoroughly than in previous years. Everyone asserted that this year's cotton production would exceed that of previous years. However, the result was completely unexpected.

    At first, the cotton did grow well. Two months after planting, it grew to over a foot tall, with strong branches and many buds, which was pleasing to the eye. Who knew that in late June, just as the cotton was blooming and forming bolls in large quantities, continuous heavy rain suddenly began, pouring down for more than ten days. The cotton fields were all waterlogged, and the buds and petals fell all over the ground. The cooperative head, Zhang Sizhou, was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, taking people to rescue the crop day and night. However, because there were no prior preparations, and there were many cotton fields, it was too late for a temporary rescue. Angrily, his eyes welled up with tears, and he kept complaining, "The old God is really hateful! It's all over now!"

    Later, by chance, Zhang Sizhou visited the Jianyang Cotton Experiment Station, and this visit shocked him greatly. They had encountered the same natural disaster, but the station's cotton had not suffered much damage. "What's going on?" After tracing the source and understanding, it turned out to be like this: the experiment station, based on the forecasts of the provincial, county, and its own weather stations, as well as the station's records of rainfall over the years, had analyzed and studied and already knew that there would be continuous overcast and rainy weather. They tried their best to sow earlier, so that the peak blooming period would be staggered from the concentrated period of heavy rain; they had dug drainage ditches when sowing, so that the land could be dry when the rain stopped; in addition, they had stored a large amount of quick-acting fertilizer, which was promptly applied to the fields after the rainy season, promoting the cotton to bloom more autumn flowers and form more autumn bolls. As a result, the average yield of cotton at the experiment station was seventy-nine jin per mu, the highest reaching one hundred and twenty-five jin, an increase of much more than the previous year. Zhang Sizhou, relying on his decades of old experience, also knew that there was a lot of rain this year; but it was more than double that of a normal year, and it was concentrated between June and July, which he could not judge. At this time, he deeply realized that the few words the county party secretary had told him were too important: "Now what we have to solve is no longer the problem of producing dozens of jin per mu, but hundreds or even more jin per mu. Relying solely on old experience is not enough, we also need to understand science."

    That year, the average cotton yield in the cooperative was thirty-two jin per mu, a decrease of 30% compared to the previous year. The thoughts of the members were somewhat chaotic for a time, and their morale was low. Zhang Sizhou was also very sad: "A little mistake in work causes so much loss to the Party and the masses!" Of course, most members still actively supported him and encouraged him, saying, "It's okay if we messed it up this year, don't blame yourself, let's try again next year!" However, Zhang Sizhou knew himself that this was not unavoidable, and it had a lot to do with his lack of scientific knowledge.

    Determined to study science diligently
    At the same time as he severely criticized himself, a new and strong belief was ignited in his heart: "Be determined to study science and start immediately!"

    Zhang Sizhou, who came from a hired laborer background, had been grazing cattle for landlords since he was fifteen years old. He had never touched a book before, and he couldn't even write his own name in the first two years after liberation. It was on this basis that he began the arduous journey of climbing the peak of science.

    Everyone knew that he was the busiest person in the cooperative. He had to ask about the production of the cooperative and the lives of the members, and he also had to participate in labor. The only way to calm down and read some books in a day was after eleven o'clock at night. Zhang Sizhou fixed the work of studying scientific books at this time. Every day, when the members had all gone to bed and were sound asleep, he dragged his tired body and leaned alone under the dim kerosene lamp, reading scientific books. He studied for two hours every day as usual, year after year, without interruption.

    In addition to the fixed study time, he carried books with him and learned whenever he had time, asking questions when he didn't understand. Whenever there were township or cooperative meetings, he also used the time to be active when people had not yet arrived. You see him squeezing here for a while, and squeezing there for a while to ask others for advice: "Comrade, please help me explain this principle." Middle school students in the cooperative and experts from the experiment station have been his teachers, and several agricultural technicians who were sent down to the countryside are even more frequent objects of his consultation. One night, it was windy and rainy outside, and resident cadre Chen Xianquan was suddenly awakened by a shout. He thought something had happened, but he heard Zhang Sizhou say from the crack in the door: "Sorry to bother you, I'm stuck on a chemical equation." Zhang Sizhou often stayed up late to study a problem and still went to the fields to work as usual the next day. In order not to let him stay up too late, his lover spent a lot of effort. But whenever he was urged tightly, he always pleaded like a child: "It's not that I don't want to sleep, it's just that I can't sleep!"

    In less than three years, Zhang Sizhou read more than one hundred books on natural science, starting from natural knowledge in elementary school and reading up to the courses of the Agricultural College. He is now reading "Agricultural Chemistry Experiment Guidance" and "Tracing Atoms in Agricultural Research." According to his plan, in another two years, he will have finished reading the basic courses that agricultural college students must take. In the room where he lives, the tables and stools are full of books, newspapers, magazines, workbooks, notebooks, thermometers, rulers, and other things rarely seen in ordinary farmhouses.

    A major feature of his study is that he experiments while learning. He especially likes to organize his past perceptual experiences and elevate them to a theoretical level to understand. Last summer, on several occasions when thunderstorms occurred, others were busy going indoors to take shelter temporarily, but he ran around with a notebook and yellow mud on his feet, carefully recording the number and situation of lightning strikes on the fields. People who didn't know the inside story thought he was busy fooling around, but in fact he was looking for an answer to a "mystery." A long time ago, there was a saying here: landmines produce gold. Zhang Sizhou had observed many times and found that crops grew well after lightning struck the fields, but he never knew why. This time, he learned in meteorology that lightning can fix nitrogen in the air. During the lightning process, a portion of nitrogen and oxygen in the air combine and return to the soil, promoting crop growth. However, he was not satisfied with this and conducted chemical analysis of the land that had been struck by lightning and the land that had not been struck by lightning until he fully understood it.

    More initiative in work
    Zhang Sizhou has put in tremendous labor in studying science, and science has given him corresponding rewards. Once his old experience is combined with science, it immediately shines with new brilliance.

    "I feel that I am much more proactive in my work now," Zhang Sizhou said when talking about his experience in learning science over the past few years, "Take fertilization as an example, what kind of soil is that field, what kind of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers should be applied, and in what proportion, we used to rely entirely on our eyesight, and naturally we couldn't hold it steady. Now, we personally participated in the soil survey of all the fields in the cooperative, and a scientific file was established for each field, so it is clear how to fertilize and how much to apply." He cited an interesting example of fertilization last year: "When applying fertilizer to cotton fields, it is not good if it rains as soon as it is applied, as the fertilizer is easily washed away; it is also not good if it does not rain for a long time after it is applied, as the fertilizer is not easily decomposed; the most ideal situation is to apply it and then let the sun shine for two days, and then it rains. When we applied the second topdressing in June last year, we referred to the forecast of the cooperative's weather station and also consulted some experienced farmers, and after combining local and foreign methods, the conclusion was that it would rain 20 to 30 millimeters in four days. Then we immediately mobilized all the members to stop all work and concentrate on fertilizing. As a result, we completed the application in two days as planned, and it rained just after two days of sunshine. The members reflected that the timing was well-controlled, and the good steel was used on the cutting edge." In that year, the average yield of seed cotton per mu in the 1,900 mu of thin cotton fields in Cotton Harvest Commune was 165 jin, creating a new record for high yields in low-yielding areas. The achievement of this result is inseparable from proactive and foresighted leadership.

    Talking about this year's production, he is even more full of confidence: "In the early years, when we said we wanted to harvest a lot of cotton, we mostly relied on luck, but now it's different." As he spoke, he took out a notebook from his pocket and pointed to the dense numbers on the notebook and said: "We have predicted that there will be very little rain in April, May, and June this year, and we must prevent and combat drought as soon as possible. In addition to deep plowing and early sowing to increase the drought resistance of cotton seedlings, we are also increasing water storage and conservation, and we are not allowed to release a drop of water. We have also freed up 30% of the fields to store water for backup." He paused here and smiled and said: "This year, the old God still wants to catch us off guard like in 1956, but it is no longer possible."

    Bold experiments
    This is my first time here for an interview. After getting off the train in Jianyang, I asked two farmers carrying manure for directions. These two young men resting by the roadside talked about Zhang Sizhou's situation, so familiar that I was a little surprised. "You are not even from the same cooperative, why are you so familiar with him?" "Hey, we just came back from the on-site meeting there not long ago. Look at that smoking guy, that's what Old Model Worker invented." I looked down the hillside he pointed to, and there was a piece of land about half a mu in size, with many flues dug under the ground. A fire was burning at one end, and smoke was coming out of the other. "Is this the 'earth fire dragon' for cotton seedling cultivation that was reported in the newspaper?" "That's it." Seeing that I was interested in this thing, they thought I was here to "learn from experience" and took the initiative to introduce to me: "Ten years early, ten years good. This guy is the most useful for planting cotton early and harvesting more. Put the seeds on it, they can sprout in three days, and they can be transplanted in a week, which is 40 days earlier than in previous years." Before his companion finished speaking, another young man took over: "There are many benefits, and it's simple to make. You don't need to spend money, just get some broken bricks and old tiles. We went back to the cooperative and showed the members a sample, and everyone clapped and cheered and followed suit. Oh, now it's being promoted all around!" At this time, I suddenly realized that I had seen smoke billowing everywhere on the undulating hills on both sides of the train. It turned out that Zhang Sizhou's "earth fire dragon" was showing its power.

    Recently, Zhang Sizhou is conducting an even bolder experiment. The day after I arrived at their cooperative, he enthusiastically took me to visit an experimental field named "Centennial Plan." This cotton field is different from others. There is a row of brick chimneys in the middle of the field. The chimneys are connected to the underground passages dug underground. These small tunnels are evenly distributed under the ground, and the exits are at both ends of the ground. He told me that this thing is called "underground cold and heat dual-purpose air pipe." If the ground temperature is low, burn it with fire from the side; if the ground temperature is high, pour water down from the chimney to cool it down, so that the ground temperature is always kept at the most suitable temperature for cotton growth. They have now initially achieved that whenever they want the cotton to sprout, it will sprout, and it can grow all year round. He said that the biggest difficulty currently encountered is that the air temperature on the ground cannot be controlled. These days, he has been referring to some relevant books, racking his brains day and night to figure out how to solve this problem with indigenous methods. He plans to install a self-designed bamboo artificial rainmaker and movable wind shelter in the cotton field. He said: "We used to do a lot of 'underground activities', and in the future we will 'make a big fuss in the sky'. If we can also control the air temperature on the ground, I don't know how much higher the cotton yield will be than it is now!"

    What kind of power will be generated by the diligent, brave, and intelligent Chinese farmers after they are armed with science? People can begin to see some signs in Zhang Sizhou.

    老模范猛攻科学关
    本报记者　刘宗棠
    四川简阳县棉丰公社社长张泗洲，是个棉花生产能手。从1951年起，年年被评选为劳动模范，两次到北京出席全国农业先进生产者会议，因此，人们见面时都亲热地称他“老模范”。
    张泗洲最初几年的工作比较顺利，凭他那一手老经验，领导大家兢兢业业地苦干，从互助组到初级农业社，步步高升，连年增产。这个以土地贫瘠出名的产棉区，每亩棉花产量由1951年的十四斤（皮棉、下同），提高到1955年的四十六斤。
    光靠老经验不够用了
    1956年成立了高级农业社，社的力量更加雄厚，社员的干劲更足，棉花地的翻犁、施肥、除虫等工作比前几年都做得细致扎实，大家断言这一年的棉花产量一定会超过以往的几年。可是，结果完全出人意料。
    开始棉花确实长得不坏，种下两个多月就长到一尺多高，枝壮蕾多，逗人喜爱。谁知6月下旬正当棉花大量开花结铃时，忽然下起连绵大雨，哗啦哗啦一气下了十几天。块块棉田都水汪汪的，花蕾和花瓣落得满地都是。社长张泗洲急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，不分昼夜带人抢救。但是因为事先没有准备，棉田又多，临时抢救已经来不及了。气得他两眼冒出泪水，不住地叫苦说：“老天爷真可恶呀！这下全完啦！”
    随后，一个偶然的机会，张泗洲到简阳棉花试验站参观，这一看，使他大吃一惊。遭遇的是同样的自然灾害，站里的棉花却没有多大损失。“这是咋回事？”追根求源一了解，原来是这样的：试验站根据省、县和自己的气象站预报以及历年来站上有关雨量记载，经过分析研究，早已知道要有连阴雨。他们尽量提早播种，使盛花期和大雨集中期错开；在播种时就挖好了排水沟，能做到雨停地干；此外还储备了大量速效肥，雨期一过就及时施到地里，促使棉花多开秋花多结秋桃。结果，试验站的棉花平均亩产七十九斤，最高的达到一百二十五斤，比上年增产很多。张泗洲凭自己几十年的老经验，也晓得这年雨水多；可是一下子比通常年景多了一倍，而且又集中在6、7月之间，他是无从判断出来的。这时，他深刻地体会到县委书记有次和他讲的几句话太重要了：“现在我们要解决的已经不是一亩产几十斤的问题，而是几百斤甚至更多的问题，光靠老经验不够用了，还要懂科学才行。”
    社里那年棉花平均每亩产三十二斤，比上年减产30％。社员思想一时有些混乱，情绪低落。张泗洲心里也很难过：“工作上出点差错，给党和群众带来多大损失呵！”当然，多数社员对他还是积极拥护的，并且鼓励他说：“今年搞坏了，也不能怪你，没关系，明年再来过！”可是，张泗洲自己知道，这不是不可避免的，这和自己不懂科学有很大关系。
    下狠心钻研科学
    就在他严厉地进行自我批评的同时，一个新的坚强的信念在内心点燃：“下狠心钻科学，马上动手！”
    长工出身的张泗洲，十五岁就给地主放牛，从没摸过书，解放后的前两年还写不出自己的名字，1954年才脱离文盲状态。他就是在这样的基础上开始了攀登科学高峰的艰巨行程。
    谁都知道他是社里最忙的人，不论是社内生产和社员的生活，他都要过问，同时还要参加劳动。一天之内要想静下来读点书，只有等到夜间十一点以后才有可能。张泗洲就把钻研科学书籍的工作固定在这个时间。每天当社员们都已上床熟睡的时候，他拖着满身疲劳，独自伏在昏暗的煤油灯下，阅读起科学书籍来。如此每天照例学习两小时，几年如一日，没有间断过。
    除了固定的学习时间外，他随身带书，有空就学，不懂就问。每逢乡、社开会，当人还没有到齐的时候，他也利用时间活动。你看他一时挤到这里，一时挤到那里向别人请教：“同志，请你帮我讲讲这个道理。”社里的中学生和试验站的专家都做过他的老师，几个下放的农业技术干部更是他经常请教的对象。一天夜里，外面正在刮风下雨，驻社干部陈先全忽然被喊声叫醒。他以为出了什么事情，却听张泗洲从门缝里说道：“打扰你，有个化学方程式把我难住了。”张泗洲常常为钻研一个问题深夜不睡，第二天还照常到地里干活。为了不让他熬夜熬得过久，他的爱人可费了不少口舌。但每当催促得紧时，他总是像小孩一样地恳求说：“我不是不愿睡，实在是睡不着呀！”
    在不到三年的时间里，张泗洲阅读了一百多本自然科学方面的书籍，从小学校的自然常识起一直读到大学农学院的课程。他现在正在阅读“农业化学实验指导”和“农业研究中的示踪原子”。按他的规划，再过两年，就要把农学院学生必修的基本课程读完。在他住的屋子里，桌子上、凳上堆满了书报杂志、作业簿、笔记本、温度计、比例尺等一般农家少见的东西。
    他学习的一大特色是边学边作试验。他特别喜欢把自己过去的感性经验加以整理，提高到理论的高度来理解。去年夏天有几次在发生雷雨的时候，别人都忙着到屋里暂避，他却拿着本子两脚黄泥到处跑，细心地记录雷电轰击田地的次数和情况。不知内情的人以为他是在瞎忙乱，其实他是为了寻找一个“谜”的答案。很早以前，这里就有一句俗话：地雷出黄金。张泗洲曾多次观察，发现田地上打过炸雷后庄稼长得好，但始终不知什么道理。这次在学习气象学中明白了雷电能固定空气中的氮气，雷电发生过程中，空气中一部分氮气和氧气化合，返回土壤，促进作物生长。但是，他并不以此满足，又把挨过雷的和没有挨过雷的土地进行化验分析，直到完全弄透彻为止。
    工作主动多了
    张泗洲在钻研科学中付出了巨大的劳动，科学也给了他相应的报酬。他的老经验一与科学相结合，立即闪露出新的光辉。
    “我觉得现在工作起来主动多了”，张泗洲在谈起几年来学科学的体会时对这点感受很深，“拿施肥来说吧，那块田土如何，氮磷钾各种肥该施些啥子，按啥子比例，过去我们是全靠眼力看，自然拿不稳。现在，社里田土由我们亲自参加全都作过土壤普查，每块田土还设立了科学档案，该咋个施肥，施多少，清清楚楚。”他举了去年施肥中一件很有意思的事例：“往棉田里上肥，刚施上去就遇到下雨，不好，肥料容易被冲跑，施上去老久不下雨，也不好，肥料不容易分解；最理想的是施上去后晒两天太阳，然后下雨。去年6月份施第二次追肥，我们参照社里气象站的预报，又找了些有经验的农民座谈，土洋一凑，结论是四天以后要下二、三十公厘雨。跟着马上发动全体社员把一切工作停下来，全力施肥。结果按计划两天上完，刚好晒了两天就下起雨来。社员们反映说：这个火候拿得好，真是好钢用在刀口上。”当年，棉丰社一千九百多亩瘦薄棉田平均亩产皮棉一百六十五斤，创造了低产区高额产量的新纪录。这个成绩的取得，同领导工作主动、有预见性是分不开的。
    谈到今年的生产，他更是充满了信心：“早些年我们说要收好多棉花，多半要靠碰运气，现在却不同了。”说着说着他从口袋里掏出一个本子，指着小本上密密麻麻的数字说：“我们已预测到今年四、五、六三个月雨水很少，要及早防旱抗旱。我们除了深耕、早播，增加棉苗的抗旱能力外，还加劲蓄水保水，不准放走一滴水。我们还腾出30％的田囤水备用。”他谈到这里停了一下又笑着说：“今年天老爷还想像1956年那样打我们个措手不及，已经办不到了。”
    大胆的试验
    我是第一次来这里采访，在简阳下了火车向两个挑粪的农民问路，这两个正在路边休息的青年谈起张泗洲的情况，熟悉得使我有点惊奇。“你们又不是一个社里的，为什么对他那么熟悉呢？”“嘿，我们没好久才打他那里开现场会转来的嘛。你看那里冒烟的家伙，就是人家老模范发明的。”我朝他指的山坡下看去，约摸有半亩大的一片土地，地下面挖了许多条烟道，一头烧起火，另一头冒烟。“这是不是报上登的棉花育苗用的‘地火龙’？”“就是它。”他们见我对这个东西感兴趣，以为我是来“取经”的，主动给我介绍说：“十年早，十年好。要棉花种得早收的多，这家伙最管用。种子放上去，三天能出苗，一个星期能移栽，比往年能提早四十天播种。”没等同伴说完，另一个小伙子就接上来：“好处多啦，做起来简单。不用花钱，弄些破砖旧瓦就行。我们回到社里做个样子给社员一看，大家拍手叫好，跟着都搞起来。噢，现在周围都推广开来啦！”这时我恍然大悟，回想起在火车上见到两旁起伏的丘陵地上，到处烟雾腾腾，原来都是张泗洲的“地火龙”在抖威风。
    最近，张泗洲又在进行一项更大胆的试验。我到他们社里第二天，他就兴致勃勃地把我带到一块命名为“百年大计”的试验田里参观。这块棉田与众不同，田的中间有一排砖砌的烟囱，烟囱下面和地下挖掘的条条通道相连，这些小坑道均匀地分布在地的下面，出口在地的两端。他告诉我，这个东西叫“地下冷热两用气管”，地温低了，就从旁用火烧；地温高了，就从烟囱灌水下去降温，使地温经常保持在最适宜棉花生长的温度。他们现在已经初步做到，啥时候要叫棉花出芽，它就出芽，一年四季都能生长。他说当前遇到的最大困难是地面上的气温还无法操纵。这些日子，他参照一些有关书籍，日夜都在苦思如何用土办法解决这个难题。他准备在棉田装上自己设计的竹制人工降雨器和活动遮风棚等。他说：“我们过去搞‘地下活动’多，今后要‘大闹天空’。要是把地上的气温也能掌握住，那棉花的产量不知要比现在高多少！”
    勤劳勇敢智慧的中国农民，用科学武装起来以后将产生怎样的威力，人们开始可以在张泗洲身上看到一些迹象。
