Comrades of the Youth:

	As the glorious 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement arrives, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, extend warm congratulations to you, congratulating you on the tremendous contributions you have made to the great cause of our people in the days of the Great Leap Forward in our country. And I wish you in advance to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement and make new and greater contributions to defending the motherland and building socialism.

	Comrades all know that as we commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress of our country has victoriously closed a few days ago. What did this conference do? It mainly did three major things: First, according to the plan proposed by our Party Central Committee, it unanimously approved the grand plan for the development of the national economy of our country in 1959; second, after full consultation, it unanimously elected the leaders of our country; and third, representing the will of the people of the whole country, it unanimously counterattacked the Indian expansionist elements' conspiracy to undermine our country's unity and interfere in our country's internal affairs. Thus, comrades can see that this conference was a conference of unity, a conference of the Great Leap Forward, and a conference to march towards new victories.

	From the speeches and resolutions of the conference on the Tibet issue and the news in the newspapers, comrades have already understood that the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements not only planned the rebellion in Tibet, but also, after the failure of the rebellion, blatantly issued a large number of calls supporting the Tibetan rebellion. This clamor is still continuing. Therefore, the youth of our country must mobilize, together with the people of the whole country, to resolutely struggle to smash the Indian expansionist elements' interference in our country's internal affairs, support for the rebel elements, and the conspiracy to undermine our country's unity.

	The Indian expansionist elements do not represent the broad masses of the Indian people. The 300 million people of India, like the 650 million people of our country, cherish the friendship between our two great neighbors very much. The Indian expansionist elements are only certain people in the upper echelons of India, and these people, like the upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet, are a tiny number of people.

	The Indian expansionist elements repeatedly say that they are only acting out of humanitarian principles, so they are determined to sympathize with the Tibetans. Look, the Indian expansionist elements are even dressing themselves up as the present-day Guanyin who is merciful and compassionate and saves all living beings. But this method is not clever at all. Because people have asked, and will continue to ask, haven't you sympathized with the seventeen-article agreement for the liberation of Tibet? Why do you now turn around and sympathize with those who undermine the seventeen-article agreement? Why do you stubbornly refuse to sympathize with the 1.1 million Tibetan people who have suffered for centuries, but insist on sympathizing with the more than 20,000 rebel elements? Why do you not sympathize with the 644,997,000 Chinese people who resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of their own country, but insist on sympathizing with a small group of traitors who stubbornly maintain the most barbaric feudal serf system in the world and do not hesitate to betray their own country? Everyone with a little common sense can understand the true purpose of these expansionist elements from this series of questions. What they call sympathy is just a guise. In fact, they do not sympathize with the Tibetan people at all, and they do not even truly sympathize with the upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet. They have ulterior motives. They are trying to use all kinds of lies to deceive the eyes of the people of the world. The reason why they are so enthusiastic about collecting Tibetan rebel elements is only to try to use these people as tools for their territorial expansion, in order to dream of separating Tibet from our great motherland, restoring their privileges in Tibet, and finally turning Tibet into their dependency.

	Why do the Indian expansionist elements dare to reach out to Tibet? Everyone knows that the Indian expansionist elements are such a group of people: they are always fearful in the face of ferocious imperialism, showing a slave-like appearance, but towards good or weak neighboring countries, they put on the airs of masters, and they want to grab a handful whenever they have the opportunity. However, they have completely misjudged the situation this time. They overestimated the power of a small group of rebel elements in Tibet, thinking that we could not and would not dare to quell the rebellion in Tibet. They also overestimated their own strength, thinking that by waving the false banner of protecting religion, they could swindle and deceive world opinion. In this way, we will definitely have to ask for something from them, and they can make a fortune from it. However, their wishful thinking has completely failed. The Tibetan rebellion has been quickly quelled. We express our respect and condolences to the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet who quelled the rebellion, and to the people of all ethnic groups and patriotic people from all walks of life in Tibet who actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. The old Tibet is gone forever. The Tibetan people, like the people of all ethnic groups in our country, will surely advance along the path of democracy and socialism. Tibet will always be Tibet of the Tibetan people, and Tibet will always be China's Tibet. The Chinese people have the power to prevent our fraternal ethnic groups from being bullied by foreign aggressors. The Chinese people have the power to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of our great motherland.

	The Indian expansionist elements' betrayal of interfering in our country's internal affairs, undermining the Five Principles, and damaging Sino-Indian friendship is doomed to utter failure. Justice is entirely on our side. Victory must belong to us. The profound friendship between the two great countries of China and India will continue to develop on the basis of the Five Principles.

	From the various reports of this National People's Congress, comrades know more clearly that the situation in our country is very good. Our motherland will implement this year's continued Great Leap Forward on the basis of the great victories already achieved in last year's Great Leap Forward. We want to increase the total industrial and agricultural output value this year by 40% compared to last year. To complete this plan, the output of some of our major products will respectively approach, catch up with, and surpass the United Kingdom. To complete this plan, our socialist cause will have a stronger material foundation. To complete this plan, our people will make new contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, completing and overfulfilling this plan together with the people of the whole country is the most important task for the youth of our country at present.

	It is entirely possible to realize this plan. We have the material and technical foundation created by last year's Great Leap Forward; we have the people's communes that can promote the rapid development of social productive forces; we have a complete set of lines, policies, and methods for building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; we have the support and help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. These are all very favorable conditions. Of course, it is not without difficulties to turn this plan into reality, which requires the people of our country to continue to exert their revolutionary efforts and carry out arduous struggles.

	Our Party hopes that the youth of our country will show the greatest revolutionary effort and become a shock force for realizing this year's Great Leap Forward. What kind of revolutionary effort should we have? This is to have a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, regard every task assigned to oneself by the organization as one's glorious duty, and use all means to complete it on time, in quantity, and in quality. This is to most actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and regard it as a noble obligation to serve the overall interests to contribute one more effort, shed one more drop of sweat, save one more cent of material, and create one more cent of wealth. This is to have a tenacious will to be fearless of difficulties and dare to overcome difficulties. Wherever the Party points, we will rush there. Wherever there is a need, we will launch an assault there. This is to strive to master technology, strive to learn advanced experience, actively participate in technical innovation and technical revolution on the basis of hard study, and do our work better and more. More than 10 million students in universities and middle schools in our country should also exert their efforts in this year's Great Leap Forward and strive for a triple harvest of reading, labor, and thought. To achieve all this, it is required that the youth of our country have higher thoughts and higher qualities, which are the most noble and greatest communist thoughts and communist qualities of mankind.

	In the past forty years, our nation has gone from deep disaster to prosperity, which is the result of the continuous development and rise of communist thoughts and communist qualities among the people and youth of our country. Forty years ago, our country was fragmented, and a group of advanced elements in our country, with the desire to save the country and the people, sought a revolutionary way out. They finally found the truth of Marxism-Leninism, organized the Communist Party of China, and led the people of our country to launch a vigorous struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Our revolutionary predecessors fought heroically, advancing wave upon wave. They put their personal life and death aside. On the battlefield, they were one against ten. In the courtroom, they were unyielding. On the execution ground, they died generously. They tried again after failure, got up after falling, buried the bodies of their comrades, wiped the blood off their bodies, and continued to move forward. They struggled arduously, persevered indomitably, whether eating bark and grass roots, whether crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, they did not regard suffering as suffering, and always had confidence in the revolution, holding high the red flag of revolution and fighting to the end. In the long revolutionary struggle, they devoted all their energy to the cause of the liberation of the people. They dared to endure and bear all hardships and difficulties, and through thousands of trials and tribulations, they tempered themselves into people who served the people wholeheartedly and unconditionally. They shared the same fate and breathed the same air as the people, became the people's most trusted people, and became the vanguard fighters leading our revolutionary cause to victory. Let us express our greatest respect to all revolutionary predecessors.

	In recent years, thousands upon thousands of young people in our country have inherited the glorious tradition of the revolutionary predecessors. They have carried out selfless labor for the prosperity of the motherland. They are advanced elements in production. They have accelerated the process of socialist construction in our motherland with outstanding achievements. They are worthy of being good sons and daughters of the motherland. Here, I would also like to especially mention some young martyrs that everyone is familiar with, such as Liu Hulan, Wang Xiaohe, Dong Cunrui, Ding Youjun, Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao, Qiu Shaoyun, Xiang Xiuli, Zhang Yufen, etc. In order to defend the interests of the motherland and the people, they dedicated their lives with the most heroic actions. We will never forget them. Their great selfless and self-sacrificing noble qualities will always inspire us to move forward.

	Everyone also knows that this National People's Congress has elected the leaders of the state institutions. Prior to this, due to repeated requests from our most beloved leader Chairman Mao himself, the Party Central Committee agreed to his active suggestion that he not be a candidate for state chairman in this session. Therefore, this conference unanimously elected the leaders of the state institutions headed by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms. This election fully reflects the political stability and the unprecedented unity of the people of the whole country in our country, and reflects the unparalleled high prestige enjoyed by the Communist Party of China among the masses of the people. The youth of the whole country warmly support the state leadership organs headed by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and are determined to resolutely struggle for the construction of our socialist motherland under the leadership of the Party and the state.

	Chairman Mao no longer serves as the Chairman of the State and concentrates on being the Chairman of the Party Central Committee, so that he can concentrate more on dealing with the Party and the State's guidelines, policies, and line issues, and it is also possible to free up more time to engage in the theoretical work of Marxism-Leninism. This is more beneficial to the whole party and the people of the whole country. Although Chairman Mao does not serve as the Chairman of the State, he is still the leader sincerely loved by the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Chairman Mao was, is, and always will be the most beloved leader and mentor of the Chinese youth. The youth of our country all feel infinitely happy because they have such a wise leadership as Chairman Mao and because Chairman Mao is in good health. We will always listen to Chairman Mao's teachings and be good students of Chairman Mao.

	Dear Comrades, since the "May Fourth" Movement, the people of our country have been advancing along the path of the October Revolution under the illumination of Marxism-Leninism. The victory of our country's revolution and construction is the victory of Marxism-Leninism. We must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, greater promote patriotism and internationalism, and under the leadership of our beloved Party and Chairman Mao, push the great cause pioneered by the revolutionary predecessors and revolutionary martyrs to new and greater victories.

	Long live our great motherland!

	Long live the Communist Party of China that leads us to victory!

	Long live our great leader and mentor Chairman Mao!

	Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    中国人民有力量维护祖国的统一
    胡耀邦在首都各界纪念“五四”四十周年大会上的讲话青年同志们：
    当光荣的“五四”运动四十周年到来的时候，我代表中国共产主义青年团中央委员会向你们致热烈的祝贺，祝贺你们在祖国大跃进的日子里，为我国人民的伟大事业作出了巨大的贡献。并且预祝你们，继承和发扬“五四”运动的革命传统，为保卫祖国和建设社会主义作出新的更大的贡献。
    同志们都知道，在我们纪念“五四”四十周年的时候，我们国家的第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，前几天已经胜利地闭幕了。这次大会做了什么事情呢？主要是做了这样三件大事：第一是根据我们党中央所提出的方案，一致地通过了我国1959年发展国民经济的宏伟计划；第二是经过充分的协商，一致地选出了我们国家的领导人员；第三是代表全国人民的意志，一致地反击了印度扩张主义分子破坏我国统一、干涉我国内政的阴谋活动。这样，同志们就可以看到，这次大会是一次团结的大会，是一次跃进的大会，是一次向新的胜利进军的大会。
    从大会关于西藏问题的发言、决议和报纸的消息中，同志们已经了解，帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子，不但策划了西藏的叛乱，而且在叛乱失败后，竟明目张胆地发出了支持西藏叛乱的大量叫嚣，这种叫嚣现在还在继续进行。因此，我国青年必须动员起来，同全国人民一道，为粉碎印度的扩张主义分子的干涉我国内政，支持叛乱分子，破坏我国统一的阴谋，进行坚决的斗争。
    印度的扩张主义分子并不代表印度的广大人民。印度三亿多人民，同我国六亿五千万人民一样，是十分珍贵我们两个伟大邻邦的友谊的。印度的扩张主义分子只是印度上层的某些人，这些人也同我国西藏地方的上层反动分子一样，是一撮数目小得可怜的人。
    印度的扩张主义分子，口口声声说他们只是出于人道主义的原则，所以才决心同情西藏人。你们看，印度的扩张主义分子竟把自己打扮成大慈大悲普救众生的现世观音。可是这种手法是一点也不高明的。因为人们已经问过，而且还要继续问，你们不是曾经同情过解放西藏的十七条协议吗？为什么现在却倒转过来同情那些破坏十七条协议的家伙呢？为什么你们硬不同情受苦受难了许多世纪的一百一十几万西藏人民，而偏偏要同情那两万多个叛乱分子呢？为什么你们不同情六万万四千九百九十几万坚决维护自己国家正当权益的中国人，而偏偏要同情一小撮顽固地维持世界上最野蛮的封建农奴制度而不惜背叛自己祖国的卖国贼呢？一切稍有常识的人都可以从这一系列的发问中明了这些扩张主义分子的真正目的。他们所说的同情，只不过是一个幌子。其实，他们根本不同情西藏人民，甚至也不真正同情西藏的上层反动分子。他们是醉翁之意不在酒。他们是企图用各种谎言蒙蔽世界人民的眼睛。他们之所以那么热心地收罗西藏的叛乱分子，只不过是企图利用这些人作为他们扩张领土的工具，以便梦想把西藏这块地方从我们的伟大祖国分离出去，恢复他们在西藏的特权，并最后使西藏变成他们的附属国。
    印度的扩张主义分子为什么敢于向西藏伸手呢？大家知道，印度的扩张主义分子是这样一伙人：他们在凶恶的帝国主义面前，总是心怀畏惧，显出一副奴才像，而对于善良的或者弱小的邻邦，却大摆其老爷架子，一有机会，就想捞一把。可是，他们这次却把形势完全估计错了。他们过高地估计了西藏一小撮叛乱分子的力量，以为我们无法平定也不敢平定西藏的叛乱。他们也过高地估计了自己的力量，他们以为打着保护宗教的虚伪旗帜就可以招摇撞骗，欺骗世界舆论。这样一来，我们就一定要有所求于他们，他们就可以从中大发横财。可是，他们的如意算盘完全落空了。西藏叛乱已被迅速平定。我们向平定叛乱的中国人民解放军驻西藏部队，向积极协助解放军平定叛乱的西藏僧俗各界人民和各阶层爱国人士表示敬意和慰问。旧的西藏永远过去了，西藏人民和我国各族人民一样，一定会沿着民主和社会主义的道路前进。西藏永远是西藏人民的西藏，西藏永远是中国的西藏。中国人民有力量使我国亲如兄弟的各族人民不受外国侵略者的欺侮。中国人民有力量维护自己伟大祖国的统一和领土完整。
    印度的扩张主义分子干涉我国内政、破坏五项原则、损害中印友谊的这种背信弃义、寡廉鲜耻的勾当，是注定要彻底失败的。正义完全在我们这边。胜利一定属于我们。中印两个伟大国家的深厚友谊，在五项原则的基础上一定会继续发展。
    从这次人民代表大会的各项报告中，同志们更清楚的知道，我们国内的形势是非常好的。我们祖国要在去年大跃进已经获得的伟大胜利的基础上，实行今年的继续大跃进。我们要使今年工农业总产值，比去年增长40％。完成这个计划，我国的一些主要产品的产量，就要分别地接近、赶上和超过英国。完成这个计划，我国社会主义事业就有了更强大的物质基础。完成这个计划，我国人民就在增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量上，做出了新的贡献。因此，和全国人民一道完成和超额完成这个计划，是我国青年当前最重要的任务。
    实现这个计划是完全可能的。我们有去年大跃进所创造的物质技术基础；我们有能够促进社会生产力迅速发展的人民公社；我们有一整套多快好省地建设社会主义的路线、方针和办法；我们有苏联和各兄弟国家的支援和帮助。这些都是非常有利的条件。当然，要把这个计划变成现实，不是没有困难的，这就需要我国人民继续鼓足革命干劲，进行艰巨的斗争。
    我们的党希望我国青年拿出最大的革命干劲来，成为实现今年大跃进的一支突击力量。什么是我们应该具有的革命干劲呢？这就是要有高度的革命责任感，把组织上交给自己的每一项任务，看作是自己的光荣职责，用尽一切办法，按时、按量、按质地去完成它。这就是要最积极地投入到增产节约运动中去，把多出一分力，多流一滴汗，多省一分材料，多创造一分财富，看作是为整体利益服务的崇高义务。这就是要有不怕困难，勇于战胜困难的顽强意志，党指向那里，我们就冲向那里，那里需要，我们就向那里突击。这就是要努力掌握技术，努力学习先进经验，在刻苦钻研的基础上，积极参加技术革新和技术革命，把自己的工作做得更多更好。我国一千多万大中学校的同学，在今年的大跃进中，同样要鼓足干劲，力争读书、劳动、思想三丰收。要做到这一切，就要求我国青年有更高的思想和更高的品质，这就是人类最高尚的、最伟大的共产主义思想和共产主义品质。
    四十年来，我们的民族从灾难深重走向欣欣向荣，正是共产主义思想和共产主义品质在我国人民和青年中不断发展不断高涨的结果。四十年前，我们的国家山河破碎，我国的一批先进分子，怀抱着救国救民的愿望，寻找革命出路，他们终于找到了马克思列宁主义真理，组织了中国共产党，领导我国人民展开了轰轰烈烈地反对帝国主义反对封建主义的斗争。我们的革命前辈，英勇奋斗，前仆后继，他们把个人的生死置之度外，在战场上以一当十，在法庭上坚贞不屈，在刑场上慷慨就义。他们失败了再干，跌倒了爬起来，掩埋好同伴的尸体，揩干自己身上的血迹，又继续前进。他们艰苦奋斗，百折不挠，无论是吃树皮草根，无论是过雪山草地，都不以苦为苦，始终对革命充满信心，高撑着革命的红旗，斗争到底。他们在长期的革命斗争中，把自己的全部精力贡献给人民的解放事业。他们勇于忍受和承担一切艰难困苦，通过千锤百炼，把自己锻炼成为忠心耿耿无条件为人民服务的人。他们和人民同命运共呼吸，成为人民最信赖的人，成为引导我们革命事业胜利前进的先锋战士。让我们向所有的革命前辈表示极大的敬意。
    几年来，我国千千万万的青年，继承了革命前辈的光荣传统，他们为祖国的富强进行了忘我的劳动，他们是生产上的先进分子，他们用出色的成绩加速了我们祖国社会主义建设的进程，他们不愧为祖国的好儿女。在这里，我还要特别提到一些大家所熟悉的青年烈士，这就是刘胡兰、王孝和、董存瑞、丁佑君、黄继光、罗盛教、丘少云、向秀丽、张玉芬等同志，他们为了保卫祖国和人民的利益，用最英勇的行为献出了自己的生命。我们永远忘不了他们。他们那种伟大无私自我牺牲的崇高品质，永远激励着我们前进。
    大家又知道，这次全国人民代表大会已经选举了国家机构的领导人员。在这以前，由于我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席自己的多次要求，党中央同意他不作这一届国家主席候选人的积极建议。所以，这次大会一致选出了以毛主席的亲密战友刘少奇主席为首的国家机构领导人员。这次选举充分反映了我国政治上的稳定和全国人民的空前团结，反映了中国共产党在人民群众中享有无比高的威信。全国青年热烈拥护以刘少奇主席为首组成的国家领导机关，决心在党和国家的领导下，为建设我们社会主义祖国而坚决奋斗。
    毛主席不再担任国家主席的职务，专做党中央的主席，这样可以使他更能够集中精力来处理党和国家的方针、政策、路线问题，也有可能腾出较多的时间来从事马克思列宁主义的理论工作。这样，对于全党和全国人民都更为有利。毛主席虽然不担任国家的主席，但是，他仍然是我国各族人民衷心爱戴的领袖。毛主席过去是，今后是，而且永远是中国青年最敬爱的领袖和导师。我国青年都因为有毛主席这样英明的领导，因为毛主席的身体健康而感到无限幸福。我们永远听从毛主席的教导，作毛主席的好学生。
    亲爱的同志们，“五四”以来，我国人民一直是在马克思列宁主义的照耀下，沿着十月革命的道路前进的。我国革命和建设事业的胜利，就是马克思列宁主义的胜利。我们一定要努力学习马克思列宁主义，更大的发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神，在我们亲爱的党和毛主席的领导下，把革命前辈和革命先烈所开辟的伟大事业，推向新的更大的胜利。
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    领导我们胜利前进的中国共产党万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
