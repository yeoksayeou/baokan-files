Zhejiang Cadres at All Levels Help Rush to Harvest Wheat

Hangzhou, May 30 (From Our Newspaper) – A large number of leading cadres at all levels in Zhejiang Province are going to the countryside to participate in the rush to harvest summer crops.

As of May 24, statistics show that 137 leading comrades, including first secretaries and secretaries of the Secretariat of Party committees at the county level and above, participated in the rush to harvest summer crops throughout Zhejiang Province. The first secretaries of the provincial, prefectural, and county (city) Party committees all participated in the harvesting of summer crops.

After leading cadres at all levels participated in harvesting labor, they played a significant role in promoting improved tools and accelerating the progress of harvesting summer crops. Wei Junzhe, a member of the Standing Committee of the Jinhua Prefectural Party Committee, performed a demonstration of wheat cutting with a Shandong-style scythe while harvesting barley in the Yaogao Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Suichang County. The commune members were very satisfied after trying it and immediately promoted it, greatly improving work efficiency. Sun Zifu, the first secretary of the Zhuji County Party Committee, improved the seed removal tools with commune members in the Huansha Commune, increasing work efficiency several times.

Leading comrades at all levels of Party committees also seized the good opportunity of harvesting summer crops to hold various symposiums during harvesting intervals to promptly summarize the experience of summer crop bumper harvests. Zhang Xueyi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Jinhua Prefectural Committee, and Cui Yuxian, First Secretary of the Jinyun County Party Committee, personally harvested and threshed two plots of wheat with different growth conditions when inspecting wheat in the Shuinan Production Team of the Wuyun Commune. One plot yielded 310 jin of dry wheat per mu, and the other yielded 237 jin of dry wheat per mu. Based on these facts, they immediately compared and analyzed the farming methods and management methods of the two plots of wheat fields with the commune members to find out the experience of high yield and the reasons for low yield.

Leading cadres at all levels ate, lived, and worked together with the commune members during labor, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses and encouraging the masses' production enthusiasm. While harvesting summer crops, leading cadres in various places also conducted field management inspections. (Attached picture)

    参加夏收　领导夏收
    浙江各级干部帮助抢收麦子
    本报杭州30日电　浙江全省各级领导干部大批下乡参加抢收抢打夏收作物。
    截至5月24日的统计，浙江全省县级以上各级党委第一书记、书记处书记等负责同志参加夏收作物抢收抢打工作的有一百三十七人，省、地、县（市）委第一书记都参加了夏收作物收割工作。
    各级领导干部参加收割劳动后，对推广改良工具、加速收割夏收作物的进度起了很大作用。金华地委常委魏俊哲在遂昌县城关公社姚高大队收割大麦时，用山东大镰刀进行割麦表演，割得又快又好，社员们经过试用后，都认为很满意，马上就推广了，大大提高了工效。诸暨县委第一书记孙子甫在浣沙公社和社员一起改进了脱籽工具，提高工效好几倍。
    各级党委负责同志还抓住夏收作物收割的良好机会，在收割的间隙召开各种座谈会，及时总结夏收作物丰产经验。中共金华地委书记处书记张学义和缙云县委第一书记崔于贤在五云公社水南生产队验收小麦时，亲自收割和亲自脱粒两丘生长情况不同的小麦，一丘亩产干小麦三百一十斤。另一丘亩产干小麦二百三十七斤。依此事实，当即与社员们一起对比分析了两丘小麦田的耕作方法和管理方法，找出高产的经验和低产的原因。
    各级领导干部在劳动中和社员群众一起，同吃同住同劳动，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎，更加密切了干部同群众的关系，鼓舞了群众的生产干劲。在收割夏收作物的同时，各地领导干部还结合进行了田间管理检查。（附图片）
