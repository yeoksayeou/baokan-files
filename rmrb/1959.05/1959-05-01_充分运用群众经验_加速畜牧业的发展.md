Comrades of the Presidium and fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's reports and will resolutely implement them. At this meeting, the issue of the traitorous behavior of the Tibetan reactionaries was discussed fervently and with righteous indignation. I wholeheartedly support the correct policies and principles of the Party and the government on this issue. The Tibetan region is an inseparable part of China's territory, and suppressing the handful of traitors in Tibet is China's internal affair. We firmly oppose any country's interference in our internal affairs.

I would like to put forward the following opinions on accelerating the development of animal husbandry for the representatives to criticize and correct.

The Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on Certain Issues Concerning People's Communes emphatically points out: "With the solution of the grain problem... great attention should be paid to accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fisheries." Premier Zhou's Government Work Report clearly instructs: "In order to make the increase in various agricultural and livestock products compatible with the development of light industry and the improvement of people's living standards,... the growth rate of crops such as hemp, sugar cane, and rapeseed, and livestock such as pigs, cattle, and horses should be increased." From this, it can be seen that our Party and government attach great importance to the speed of animal husbandry development. Therefore, accelerating the development of animal husbandry to meet the demands of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the increasing need for livestock products for the improvement of people's living standards, and to complete and overfulfill the glorious task of increasing animal husbandry production in 1959, is of great significance and becomes a major responsibility of all those engaged in animal husbandry nationwide.

Vigorously promote the masses' experience in multiple births of livestock

The key to accelerating the development of animal husbandry lies in putting politics in command and the mass technological revolution movement. The development of animal husbandry in various places proves that wherever the leadership grasps tightly and the masses are mobilized well, the leap forward in animal husbandry is great; conversely, the development of animal husbandry is slower. Therefore, the most important work in accelerating the development of animal husbandry is first to put politics in command. The most important aspects of the mass technological revolution movement are multiple births and good rearing.

The masses have a wealth of experience in making livestock breed quickly and have many offspring. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, under the wise leadership of the Party, livestock personnel broke superstitions, liberated their minds, and went all out, creating a great and unprecedented miracle of livestock multiple births. In terms of cattle, a cow in the Chengguan People's Commune in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, gave birth to four calves in one birth, and three cows in Zhangzui Township in Yingshan County, Hubei Province, gave birth to twins. Four cows in Linba Commune in Deng County, Henan Province, gave birth to twins, and 47 cows in Huaibin County and 25 cows in Shenqiu County all gave birth to twins. From this, it can be seen that cows giving birth to twins is no longer a coincidence, but the result of using double mating and repeated mating methods. Therefore, it is possible for people to control whether a cow gives birth to multiple calves in one birth. In terms of horses, there were cases of one horse giving birth to two foals in Xiangcheng County and Minquan County, Henan Province, which proves that it is no longer impossible for a mare to give birth to twins after multiple matings. In terms of sheep, Xinyang County, Henan Province, used strong mating, hot mating, and repeated mating to make a group of ewes give birth to an average of three to four lambs, which is more than double the yield of ordinary lamb groups, which give birth to one to two lambs per litter. In terms of goats, nine goats in Chengguan People's Commune and Shuizhai People's Commune in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, gave birth to eight to thirteen lambs in one birth respectively after multiple matings, which is more than double the number of lambs usually produced. In terms of pigs, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, launched double mating, repeated mating, and multiple mating to eliminate single mating. From October to the end of 1958, 28 sows in the county gave birth to 20 to 43 piglets in one birth, and the number of piglets per litter increased from six to eight to nine to ten. This experience is extremely valuable. If we summarize this experience and vigorously promote it, the speed and quantity of livestock reproduction in our country will make an unprecedented leap forward. Therefore, we have humbly learned from the masses in Xiangcheng, Xinyang and other counties and truthfully summarized their experience in multiple births of livestock. Now, I will summarize our summary as follows: The main experience is to put politics in command and combine it with breeding techniques. Female animals should be hot-mated (bred during the first estrus about ten days after giving birth), mated in a timely manner during estrus (bred 18 to 24 hours after the start of estrus), and mated multiple times at regular intervals (bred three to five times, with intervals of three to eight hours for pigs and sheep, and eight to twelve hours for cattle, horses, and donkeys, until estrus stops), alternating between two male animals, inducing estrus for animals not in estrus, and carefully feeding and managing both the mother and offspring. Please comrades criticize whether this summary is correct.

We must vigorously promote these valuable experiences of the masses, and at the same time, we must further experiment and research on the basis of the masses' experience, raise it to theory and determine its significant application effects.

To raise livestock well, three problems must be solved: producing large quantities of feed, rationally preparing and feeding it; adopting feeding management techniques suitable for livestock physiology; and preventing diseases.

To raise livestock well, we must pay great attention to three important issues: first, producing large quantities of fodder and rationally preserving, preparing, and feeding it; second, adopting feeding management techniques and systems that are suitable for livestock physiology according to specific conditions; and third, preventing diseases.

The masses have rich experience in cultivating high-yield feed crops and in using wild plants and animals as feed. The four-season Chinese spinach in Sichuan, the water hyacinth in Guangdong, the canna in Yunnan and Fujian, and more than a dozen kinds of high-yield feed crops such as pumpkins and sweet potatoes, which yield 10,000 to hundreds of thousands of catties per mu, have been cultivated and used extensively in many regions across the country, greatly increasing feed production. The masses have used hundreds of kinds of wild plants and animals as feed, opening up new avenues for increasing feed production. The masses say: "Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find it." Our animal husbandry researchers are actively conducting feed chemical analysis in conjunction with the masses' experience to determine their nutritional components in order to increase their utilization value.

Increasing the nutritional value of feed, especially the nutritional value of roughage, is also one of the effective ways to increase feed. This work has achieved certain research results and has been promoted and applied, such as silage, fermented feed, and alkalized rice straw and wheat straw. These roughages, after being treated with alkali, not only increase their nutritional value by more than double, but are also more palatable to cattle and horses.

Experiments have proven that aureomycin and terramycin can promote the weight of pigs and chickens and reduce diseases. Many people's communes have set up factories to produce and widely use them. The Animal Husbandry Research Institute and the Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences have jointly proved that azotobacter can increase the crude protein in feed, and using it to feed pigs can promote faster weight gain. These experimental research results have opened up broad avenues for bacterial feed and pointed out new directions for increasing feed production.

In recent years, especially after the communization of the people, large-scale collective livestock raising has accumulated a lot of feeding management experience, established reasonable systems and organizations, built sheds and stables, started using livestock machinery, and selected politically reliable and active feeders, which have prepared good conditions for powerfully promoting the development of animal husbandry. At present, the condition of draft animals across the country is better than last spring, which is conducive to this year's spring plowing and breeding.

Traditional Chinese veterinary medicine has accumulated the experience of our working people fighting against livestock diseases for thousands of years. It is a rich and colorful treasure trove of veterinary knowledge in our country, and it has guaranteed the development of animal husbandry in our country in the past and now. Therefore, Chinese and Western veterinarians across the country should unite and resolutely implement the Party and government's policy on traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, comprehensively learn, systematically organize, promote and improve the legacy of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, and create a new school of veterinary medicine in our country.

More than 160,000 folk veterinarians across the country have played a great role in treating livestock diseases and protecting livestock health. Before liberation, they endured the oppression and discrimination of the reactionary classes, and their lives were very difficult and painful. After liberation, under the correct policy of the Party's unity, education, improvement, and utilization, their political awareness has improved, their social status has been raised, and their work has become more active. Now the people's communes have guaranteed their work and life, their enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, and they will make more and greater contributions to accelerating the development of animal husbandry.

Veterinary biological products are an effective weapon for preventing and controlling livestock diseases. In 1958, more than 1.4 billion milliliters were manufactured nationwide, an increase of 1.7 times compared with 1957 and 14 times compared with 1952. Approximately 90 million pigs were preventively injected against swine fever. Eight provinces across the country have basically eliminated swine fever, 265 counties have basically eliminated Newcastle disease in chickens, and many areas have eliminated livestock schistosomiasis and sheep pox. Before 1958, bovine plague had been completely eliminated across the country except for Tibet, foot-and-mouth disease was controlled, and the harm of anthrax and emphysema was greatly reduced. This provides more guarantees for the development of animal husbandry.

Veterinary research work in our country is constantly creating new vaccines, especially attenuated vaccines, making it the country that uses attenuated vaccines most widely and in the largest quantities in the world. In order to overcome the difficulties in use caused by the short shelf life of attenuated vaccines, veterinary personnel in our country, with the strong support of the Party, have solved simple and easy-to-master vaccine production methods for the masses, such as rabbit-adapted attenuated swine fever vaccine, rabbit-adapted attenuated bovine plague vaccine, and rabbit-adapted attenuated bovine contagious pleuropneumonia vaccine, all of which can be manufactured in large quantities and used locally in a rural environment using simple equipment. During large-scale preventive injections of attenuated vaccines, various places adopted the method of combatizing the injection work, organizing the injection personnel, the livestock control personnel, the vaccine production personnel, and the vaccine transportation personnel, closely cooperating, and vaccinating 80% to 100% of the livestock in a city or county in a short period of time, such as Harbin City vaccinating approximately 20,000 pigs in the city within 24 hours. The acquisition of these brilliant achievements fully proves the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. This is impossible in capitalist countries.

The above-mentioned mass experience powerfully proves that the masses have boundless energy, the masses have infinite wisdom, and the Party's mass line is completely correct. Our animal husbandry and veterinary workers must resolutely implement the Party's mass line, conscientiously and humbly learn from the masses and summarize their valuable experience. At the same time, we will wholeheartedly and enthusiastically teach them our scientific and theoretical knowledge, and rapidly improve their research technology and capabilities, forming a large army of millions of animal husbandry researchers. This will inevitably play a greater role in improving animal husbandry and veterinary research results and in the rapid development of animal husbandry. The above also proves once again that the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and walking on two legs of integrating both is completely correct. This is achieved through full cooperation, combination, collaboration, connection, and division of labor between the research of the broad masses and the research of research personnel.

Our animal husbandry and veterinary personnel across the country are deeply convinced that under the wise leadership of the Party, strengthening the animal husbandry and veterinary team and organization, conscientiously implementing the Party's general line, going all out with revolutionary enthusiasm, doing practical work, working hard, working cleverly, embodying the spirit of scientific analysis everywhere, and universally and deeply promoting animal husbandry and veterinary science and technology, we will definitely accelerate the development of animal husbandry and complete and overfulfill the animal husbandry tasks for 1959. We have seen that with the leap forward in socialist construction, animal husbandry in our country will rapidly enter a new, more glorious and brilliant historical stage!

专栏：

    充分运用群众经验
    加速畜牧业的发展
    程绍迥代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告并坚决贯彻执行。这次会议上热烈地、激昂愤慨地讨论了西藏反动分子叛国问题，我衷心地拥护党和政府对于这个问题的正确方针和政策。西藏地区是中国领土不可分割的一部分，肃平西藏一小撮叛国分子是中国的内政，我们坚决反对任何国家对我国内政的干涉。
    我对加速发展畜牧业问题提出以下意见，请代表们批评指正。
    党中央第八届第六次全体会议关于人民公社若干问题的决议中着重地指出：“随着粮食问题的解决……并且极大地注意加速林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的发展。”周总理的政府工作报告明确的指示：为了使各种农产品和畜产品的增产同轻工业的发展、人民生活水平的提高这些情况相适应，……提高了麻类、甘蔗、油菜子等作物和猪、牛、马等牲畜的增长速度。”由此可见，我们的党和政府极其重视畜牧业发展的速度。因而，加速发展畜牧业以适应工农业大跃进对畜牧业的要求，人民生活水平的日益提高对畜产品的需要，为完成和超额完成一九五九年畜牧增产的光荣任务具有重要的意义，成为全国从事畜牧业者的重大职责。
    大力推广群众创造的牲畜多生仔的经验
    加速发展畜牧业的关键在于政治挂帅和群众技术革命运动。各地畜牧业的发展形势都证明凡是领导上抓得紧，发动群众好的地方，畜牧业跃进就很大，反之畜牧业发展就较慢；因而，加速发展畜牧业的最重要工作首先是政治挂帅。在群众技术革命运动方面最主要的是生得多和养得好。
    使牲畜繁殖快、生仔多的经验在群众中是很丰富的。在全国大跃进的一九五八年，畜牧人员在党的英明领导下，破除了迷信，解放了思想，鼓足了干劲，创造了牲畜多生仔的伟大而空前的奇迹。在黄牛方面，河南项城县城关人民公社的一头母牛一胎生四犊，湖北英山县张咀乡有三头母牛一胎生双犊，河南邓县林扒公社有四头母牛生双犊，淮滨县有四十七头母牛，沈丘县有二十五头母牛均生了双犊。由此可见，母牛产双犊不再是偶然的事，而是由于采用双重配，复配方法的结果。因此，母牛一胎生多犊是人可以掌握的事。在马方面，河南项城县和民权县均有一马一胎生两驹的事例，这证明母马经多次配种而生双驹不再是不可能的事了。在绵羊方面，河南信阳县采用强配、热配、复配使一群母羊平均生羔三至四只，较一般绵羔群每窝生羔一至二只提高产量一倍以上。在山羊方面，河南项城县城关人民公社和水寨人民公社共有九只母山羊经多次配种，分别一胎产羔八至十三只，比一般多产羔一倍以上。在猪方面，河南项城县开展了双配、复配、多配，消灭单配，全县从一九五八年十月到年底有二十八只母猪一胎分别产仔猪二十至四十三只，全县母猪由一窝生六至八只，增加到九至十只。这些经验是极其宝贵的。总结这些经验，大力地推广，则我国牲畜繁殖的速度与数量将会空前的大跃进。因此，我们曾到项城、信阳等县虚心地向群众学习并实事求是地总结他们的牲畜多生仔的经验。现将我们的总结摘要述后：主要的经验是政治挂帅，结合配种技术。母畜宜热配（产仔后十天前后第一次发情时即配种），情期适时配（在开始发情后十八至二十四小时配种），多次定时配（配种三至五次），每次相隔时间：猪羊三至八小时一次，牛马驴八至十二小时一次，至不发情时停止配种），两个公畜交替配，不发情的催情配，对母仔要精心饲养管理。这个总结摘要是否正确请同志们批评。
    群众的这些宝贵经验，我们要大力推广，同时我们还要在群众经验基础上进一步试验研究，提高到理论并确定其重大的应用效果。
    养好牲畜要解决三个问题：大量生产饲料，合理调制饲喂；采用适合牲畜生理的饲养管理技术；预防疫病
    养好牲畜须极大注意三个重要问题：第一是大量生产饲草饲料并合理地保存、调制、饲喂，第二是根据具体情况和适合牲畜生理的饲养管理技术和制度，第三是预防疫病。
    群众在栽培高产饲料作物方面，在利用野生动植物作饲料方面均有丰富的经验。四川的四季牛皮菜，广东的水浮莲，云南、福建的蕉芋，各地的南瓜和红薯等十余种亩产万斤至十几万斤的高产饲料作物已在全国许多地区大量栽培利用，大大地增产了饲料。群众利用作饲料的野生动植物已有数百种之多，为增产饲料打开了新的园地。群众说：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找”。我们畜牧研究人员正在结合群众的经验积极地进行饲料化学分析，确定其营养成份，以提高其利用价值。
    提高饲料的营养价值，尤其是粗饲料的营养价值也是增加饲料的有效方法之一。这项工作已获得一定的研究成果，并已推广应用，如青贮饲料，发酵饲料，碱化稻草麦秸。这些粗饲料经碱化处理，不但提高其营养价值约一倍以上，而且牛马更喜欢吃。
    试验证明金霉素、土霉素均能促进猪、鸡的体重，减少疾病。不少人民公社已设工厂，大量生产，广泛应用。中国农业科学院畜牧研究所和土壤肥料研究所共同研究证明了固氮菌能增加饲料中的粗蛋白，用以喂猪能促使增重更快。这些试验研究成果开辟了细菌饲料的广阔道路，同时为增产饲料指出新的方向。
    几年来尤其在人民公社化之后，大规模集体饲养牲畜积累了许多饲养管理经验，建立了合理的制度和组织，修建了棚圈和厩舍，开始使用了畜牧机器，选定了政治可靠、工作积极的饲养人员，为有力地推进畜牧业的发展准备了良好条件。目前全国耕畜膘情比去春更好，有利于今年春耕和繁殖。
    中兽医积累了几千年来我国劳动人民与牲畜疾病作斗争的经验，它是我国兽医知识的丰富多彩的宝库，它在过去和现在都保障着我国畜牧业的发展。因此，全国中西兽医团结起来坚决贯彻执行党和政府的中兽医政策，全面学习，系统整理，发扬提高祖国兽医学遗产，创造我国新的兽医学派。
    全国十六万多民间兽医在治疗牲畜疾病保护牲畜健康上起了很大的作用。在解放前他们忍受反动阶级的压迫和歧视，生活很困难痛苦，解放后，在党的团结、教育、提高、使用的正确方针下，他们的政治觉悟进步了，社会地位提高了，工作积极了。现在人民公社保证了他们的工作和生活，他们的积极性空前高涨，为加速发展畜牧业将作出更多更大的贡献。
    兽医生物药品为防治家畜疫病的有效武器。一九五八年全国制造了十四亿多毫升，比一九五七年增加一点七倍，比一九五二增加十四倍。约九千万只猪预防注射了猪瘟。全国有八个省基本上消灭猪瘟，二百六十五个县基本上消灭了鸡新城疫，许多地区消灭了牲畜血吸虫病和羊痘。在一九五八年以前全国除西藏地方已彻底消灭了牛瘟，控制了口蹄疫，大大地减少了炭疽和气肿疽的危害。这对发展畜牧业有了更多的保障。
    我国兽医研究工作不断创造新的疫苗，尤其是弱毒疫苗，成为世界上应用弱毒疫苗最广泛而最大量的国家。为了克服弱毒疫苗的保存期短所造成在使用上的困难，我国兽医人员在党的大力支持下解决了简而易行，能为群众所掌握的制苗方法，如兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗、兔化牛瘟弱毒疫苗、兔化牛肺疫弱毒疫苗等，均可以利用简单设备，在农村的环境下，大量制造，就地使用。在大规模预防注射弱毒疫苗时，各地采用了注射工作战斗化的方法，将注射人员，控制牲畜人员，制苗人员和运送疫苗人员组织起来，紧密地配合，于短时间内，将一市一县的牲畜的百分之八十至一百都被注射，如哈尔滨市于二十四小时内注射全市的猪约二万只。这些辉煌成绩的获得充分证明我国社会主义制度的无比优越性。这是资本主义国家所不可能的。
    以上所述的群众经验有力地证明群众的干劲冲天，群众的智慧无穷，党的群众路线是十分正确的。我们畜牧兽医工作者必须坚决贯彻执行党的群众路线，认真地虚心地向群众学习总结他们的宝贵经验，同时，我们也毫无保留地热忱地将我们的科学技术和理论知识教给他们，迅速提高他们的研究技术和能力，形成几百万人的畜牧研究大军，对于提高畜牧兽医的研究成果，对于畜牧业的迅速发展必然起更伟大的作用。以上所述又一次证明广大群众的研究和研究人员的研究充分合作、结合、协作、联系、分工的土洋结合，土洋并举的两条腿走路的方针是完全正确的。
    我们全国畜牧兽医人员深信在党的英明领导下，加强畜牧兽医队伍和组织，认真贯彻执行党的总路线，鼓足革命干劲，实干、苦干、巧干，处处体现出科学分析精神，普遍深入地推广畜牧兽医科学技术，一定能加速发展畜牧业并完成和超额完成一九五九年的畜牧任务。我们已看到随着社会主义建设的跃进，我国畜牧业将迅速进入更光辉灿烂的新历史阶段！
