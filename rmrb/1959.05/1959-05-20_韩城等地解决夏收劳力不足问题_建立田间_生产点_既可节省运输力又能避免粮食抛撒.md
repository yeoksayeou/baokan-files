Han cities and other places solve the problem of insufficient labor in the summer harvest
Establish "production points" in the fields
It can save transportation capacity and avoid grain scattering

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 19th) Some people's communes in Hancheng, Chang'an and other counties in Shaanxi Province have moved wheat threshing grounds, warehouses, livestock pens and pigsties to the fields this year during the summer harvest, and established production points in the fields to solve the current shortage of labor and livestock. Relevant departments in Shaanxi Province believe that this is an effective way to solve the current difficulties of labor and livestock, and call on people's communes everywhere to study and promote it seriously.

Now, people's communes in Chang'an, Xingping, Baoji, Zhouzhi and other counties are studying and arranging the design of "four-to-field" in combination with the preparation for the summer harvest. Judging from the current growth of wheat, the amount of summer harvest work this year has increased by one or two times compared with previous years, and the increase in transportation volume is even more prominent. In previous years, during the summer harvest, all places had to transport wheat stalks from the farmlands three or four miles away from the village to the threshing ground near the village to thresh. Using iron-wheeled carts, five laborers and two animals could only pull two or three loads a day. This year, the 13 production brigades of the Zhiyang Management Area of ​​the Zhichuan Commune in Hancheng County established 50 field wheat threshing grounds in the border areas, turning remote lands into nearby lands and shortening the transportation distance. The number of wheat carts pulled each day increased from two or three to more than a dozen, saving more than 20,000 laborers and livestock. After the establishment of the field threshing ground, the carrying distance is greatly shortened, and the phenomenon of grain scattering will naturally be reduced. It can also achieve simultaneous harvesting, transportation, drying, and threshing, avoiding accidental losses caused by natural disasters. Establishing a warehouse in the field can also avoid round-trip transportation during grain harvesting, threshing, and drying. At the same time, since these temporary warehouses are ventilated and transparent on all sides, the grain is easy to air-dry and will not become moldy, and it is also easy to inspect. The Dujiacun Production Team of Guodu Commune in Chang'an County used dilapidated materials to build field warehouses and livestock sheds, making do with simple and practical conditions. Some people's communes in Lintong and Weinan counties also use cliffs and field edges to build livestock pens and pigsties, and dig caves in the Loess Plateau area as breeding rooms and warehouses. Now, all localities are using existing open spaces and open spaces in the fields, and if there is no open space, they will wait until the barley and rapeseed are harvested before opening the ground.

Following the summer harvest is the work of summer planting, summer harrowing, and fertilization. At this time, long-distance manure delivery becomes a very urgent and arduous task. The Guodu People's Commune in Chang'an County is composed of 52 villages of various sizes, and a quarter of its more than 70,000 mu of land is distributed in places four or five miles away from the villages. These remote lands receive less fertilizer every year and have low yields. The more than 540 mu of land near Wenguobao is the famous "Jiudao Bay", a remote land connected by "one whip." In the past, it took dozens of days to generally fertilize these lands, but after moving the pigsties and livestock pens to the fields, only one-third of the original time is needed to generally fertilize them once. After the Xiangjisi Management Area moved the pigsty to the field, because the bedding soil was convenient, each pig accumulated 20 more large carts of fertilizer per year than in the past. The entire management area of ​​450 pigs accumulates more than 9,000 large carts of fertilizer throughout the year. The Heping Production Team of the Maxing Management Area of ​​the Mingdu Commune in Chang'an County feeds more than 50 heads of livestock in the original land far away from the village, which is convenient for attendance and saves labor and livestock. The efficiency of manure delivery alone has increased by three times compared with the past, and more than 1,000 large carts of fertilizer can be accumulated each year. In addition, it can also change the habit of extensive planting and low harvesting in the original land, and quickly increase grain production.

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 19th) The Xin Xin Production Brigade of the Laocheng People's Commune in Yanshi County, Henan Province, has adopted methods such as wheat field threshing grounds and adjusting agricultural work to solve the problem of insufficient labor, ensure a bumper wheat harvest and return all grains to the family, and ensure timely planting of autumn crops.

The Xin Xin Production Brigade divides all the labor force into professional teams for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and sowing to improve labor efficiency. Elementary school students and the elderly are organized into wheat picking teams to ensure that no ears are lost. During the summer harvest and summer planting, autumn field manure delivery, watering, and intertillage are completed as early as possible without hindering the growth of autumn crops. Now, the Xin Xin Production Brigade has fully prepared the "collection, transportation, threshing, drying, storage, and planting" six tasks for the summer harvest and summer planting. The maturity period varies by ten days from the mountains to the low-lying areas. They concentrate their efforts to harvest from the early-maturing mountains down, and pre-divide the squares. Now, ten to fifteen mu have been divided into one field, and the wheat field is threshed. Ensure that the wheat does not rot when it enters the field. After the wheat enters the field, the ears are chopped and stacked at night. They also built 42 warehouses, ensuring that each warehouse is accessible to vehicles and each warehouse has a pulley to save labor, ensure timely threshing and timely warehousing, and prevent moisture and rats. Late autumn achieves harvesting of wheat followed immediately by sowing.

The slogan of the Xin Xin Production Brigade is: harvest cleanly, thresh cleanly, winnow cleanly, thresh while drying while putting into the warehouse, to achieve a bumper harvest. (Zhang Lizhong)

    韩城等地解决夏收劳力不足问题
    建立田间“生产点”
    既可节省运输力又能避免粮食抛撒
    本报西安19日电　陕西省韩城、长安等县部分人民公社今年在夏收中把麦场、仓库、畜圈、猪圈全部搬到田间，在田间建立生产点，以解决当前农村中的劳畜力紧张的问题。陕西省有关部门认为这是解决当前劳畜力困难的一个有效办法，号召各地人民公社认真研究推行。
    现在，长安、兴平、宝鸡、盩厔等县的人民公社正结合夏收准备，研究安排“四到田”的设计。从当前小麦的生长状况看来，今年的夏收工作量比往年增加了一、两倍，运输量的增加更为突出。往年夏收时，各地要把村外三四里路以外的远地麦子连秆运到村边的场里脱粒。用铁轮大车拉运，五个劳力两个畜力，每天只能拉两、三次。今年韩城县芝川公社芝阳管区十三个生产大队，在边外地区建立了五十个田间碾麦场、变远地为近地，缩短了运输距离，每天拉麦子由两、三车增加到十几车，共可节省两万多个劳力和畜力。建立田间碾麦场后，担运距离大大缩短，抛撒粮食现象自然就会减少，还可做到边割、边运、边晒、边脱粒，避免因自然灾害而带来的意外损失。田间建立仓库也可避免粮食收打、晾晒时往返运输。同时，由于这些临时仓库四面通风透光，粮食容易风干、不霉坏，也便于检查。长安县郭杜公社杜家村生产队利用破旧材料，盖成田间仓库和牲口饲养棚，因陋就简，经济实用。临潼、渭南等县部分人民公社还利用崖边、地边修建畜圈、猪圈、靠近黄土高原地区挖修窑洞作饲养室和仓库。现在各地正利用田间的现有空地光场面，没有空地的地方等到大麦、油菜收割后再光场面。
    紧接夏收而来的是夏种、夏耱、施肥工作，这时，远途送粪成为一项非常紧迫而艰巨的任务。长安县郭杜人民公社由大小五十二个村庄组成，七万多亩土地中有四分之一分布在离村庄四、五里路远的地方，这些远地每年施肥较少，产量不高。温国堡附近的五百四十多亩土地，是有名的“九道湾”，“一条鞭”远地，过去给这些地普遍施一次肥需要几十天时间，但把猪圈、畜圈搬到田间后，只要有原来三分之一的时间就可以普遍施肥一次。香积寺管理区把猪圈搬到田间后，因垫土方便，每头猪每年比过去多积肥二十大车。全管理区四百五十头猪，全年就多积肥九千多大车。长安县鸣犊公社马兴管理区和平生产队，把五十多头牲畜喂在离村庄很远的原地里，出勤近便，又可节省劳力畜力，仅送粪一项效率比过去提高了三倍，每年还可多积肥一千多大车，另外，还可改变原地广种薄收习惯，迅速提高粮食产量。
    本报郑州19日电　河南省偃师县老城人民公社新新生产大队，采取麦地打场、调整农活等方法解决劳动力不足的问题，保证小麦丰产丰收、颗粒还家，并保证适时种上秋庄稼。
    新新生产大队将全部劳力分成收割、运输、打场、播种四个方面的专业队，以提高劳动效率。并把小学生和老人们组成拾麦小组，保证不丢穗。夏收夏种期间的秋田送粪、浇水、中耕等农活，在不妨碍秋庄稼生长的情况下，尽量提前做完。现在，新新生产大队已经全部准备好夏收夏种的“收、运、打、晒、藏、种”六项工作。从山岭到洼地，成熟期相差十天，他们集中力量，从先熟的岭地往下割，预先划好方。现在已经划好十亩到十五亩一个场，就麦地打场。做到麦子入场不烂，麦入场后铡穗，晚上打起垛。他们还搞了四十二间仓库，做到仓仓通车，每个仓搞一个滑车，以节省劳力，保证及时打完及时入仓，防湿防鼠。晚秋做到随收麦随种。
    新新生产大队的口号是：收净、打净、扬净，边打、边晒、边入仓，做到丰产丰收。（张励中）
