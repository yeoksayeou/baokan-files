Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, May 4th. With the flood season approaching, the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau deployed its flood prevention work at the end of April.

This year's flood season will be the last battle between the Sanmenxia project and the Yellow River flood. By next year's flood season, after the Sanmenxia Dam is built, the issue here will no longer be flood prevention, but controlling the flood to serve the people.

To have the dam fully assume the role of flood control by next year, the key lies in this year's flood season. If we can overcome the flood this year and ensure the smooth construction of the dam foundation pit, then by the end of this year, more than 60% of the dam pouring task can be completed; the remaining 40% of the pouring task can be fully completed before next year's flood season.

According to the Sanmenxia Meteorological Observatory's forecast, this year's flood season may arrive about half a month earlier than in previous years, and the rainfall will also be higher than in previous years. After the Sanmenxia cut-off, the Yellow River is like a giant dragon with its throat pinched, and all the river water can only flow downstream from the twelve comb-tooth bottom holes of the dam. Due to the limitation of the bottom hole discharge, water may accumulate upstream of the dam. The peach flood flow in March was only 3,000 cubic meters per second, but the water level upstream of the dam was six meters higher than during last year's flood season when the flow was 9,000 cubic meters per second. This situation shows that this year's flood prevention work in Sanmenxia will be the most tense and arduous.

When deploying this year's flood prevention work, the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau fully studied the characteristics of this year's flood and the major issues related to flood prevention work. All units are full of confidence and expressed their determination to ensure the victory of this year's flood prevention work. The Engineering Bureau and its affiliated units have established special flood prevention agencies, determined to make all flood prevention preparations before the end of May.

    三门峡工程局职工厉兵秣马
    准备同黄河洪水作最后搏斗
    新华社三门峡4日电  伏汛将到，黄河三门峡工程局已在4月底部署了今年的防汛工作。
    今年汛期将是三门峡工程同黄河洪水的最后一次搏斗。到明年汛期三门峡大坝筑成以后，这里就不再是防汛的问题，而是要控制洪水为人们服务了。
    要在明年使大坝担负起全部拦洪坑作用，关键在于今年汛期。如果今年汛期能够战胜洪水，确保大坝基坑的顺利施工，那么到今年年底，大坝浇筑任务就可以完成60％以上；剩下40％的浇筑任务，到明年汛期以前也就完全有把握完成了。
    根据三门峡气象台预报，今年汛期较往年可能提前半个月左右到来，雨量也较往年为多。而在三门峡截流以后，黄河就像搯住了咽喉的巨龙，全部河水仅能从大坝的十二个梳齿底孔流向下游。由于底孔泄水的限制，在坝体上游很可能出现壅水现象。3月份的桃汛流量只有三千秒公方，但是大坝上游的水位却比去年汛期流量九千秒公方时还要高出六公尺。这一情况说明，今年三门峡的防汛工作将是最紧张、最繁重的一次。
    三门峡工程局在部署今年的防汛工作时，充分研究了今年泛期的特点和防泛工作中有关的重大问题。各单位充满信心，表示一定要确保今年防汛工作的胜利。工程局和所属各单位都已成立了防汛的专门机构，决心在5月底以前作好一切防汛准备工作。
