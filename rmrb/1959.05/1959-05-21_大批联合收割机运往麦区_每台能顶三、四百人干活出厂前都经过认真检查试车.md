Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: From January to May 17th this year, local machinery industries have produced 370 grain combine harvesters. These machines are being successively transported to major wheat-producing areas to support wheat harvesting in these regions.

The total number of combine harvesters produced in the first four months of this year increased by more than 60% compared to the same period last year. Among the combine harvesters that have already been produced, except for thirteen newly-trial-produced machines, the rest are KT3-3 combine harvesters that China has produced in recent years. This year, in the production of this type of combine harvester, the design has been modified according to the changes in China's wheat planting situation, making it suitable for harvesting densely planted and robust wheat. The daily workload of this type of combine harvester requires three to four hundred people to work for a day if harvested manually.

Among the new combine harvesters manufactured this year, there is one called the "High Yield No. 2" combine harvester. It is light and agile, weighing just over one ton per unit (the KT3-3 type weighs five tons), threshes cleanly, and is suitable for use in high-yield fields. China has also absorbed the advantages of some foreign combine harvesters and, combined with China's specific conditions, designed and manufactured some other types of combine harvesters, which will soon participate in the wheat harvest and undergo trials in actual operation to further improve the design, finalize the design, or produce in large quantities.

Various agricultural machinery factories attach great importance to the quality of combine harvesters. The machines undergo careful inspection and trial runs before leaving the factory. The factories concerned also actively notify users that if the machines are damaged during transportation, the factory will be responsible for reissuing the damaged parts using the fastest method.

    大批联合收割机运往麦区
    每台能顶三、四百人干活出厂前都经过认真检查试车
    据新华社20日讯　各地机械工业从今年1月到5月17日，已经生产了三百七十台谷物联合收割机。这些机器正在陆续运往各主要产麦区，支援这些地区收割小麦。
    今年前四个多月生产出来的联合收割机，总台数比去年同期增加了60％以上。在已经生产出来的联合收割机中，除试制了十三台新产品外，其余的都是我国近几年曾生产过的KT3—3型联合收割机。今年在生产这种联合收割机时，又根据我国小麦种植情况的变化修改了设计，使它适于收割株密茁壮的小麦。这种联合收割机每天的工作量，如用人力收割需要三、四百人干一天。
    在今年制成的新型联合收割机中，有一种叫作“高产二号”联合收割机。它体轻灵巧，每台一吨多重（KT3—3型重五吨），脱粒干净，适于在高产田里使用。我国还吸收国外一些联合收割机的优点，结合我国的具体情况，设计和制造了一些其它类型的联合收割机，不久也将参加麦收，在实际操作中进行试验，以便进一步改进设计、定型或大批生产。
    各农业机械厂十分重视联合收割机的质量，机器出厂以前都经过了认真的检查和试车。有关工厂还主动通知用户，机器在运送途中如有损坏，工厂将用最快的方法负责补发被损坏的零件。（附图片）
