　　Making Every Effort to Tap the Potential of Old Mines
    Shuangyashan Achieves Large-Scale Bumper Harvests
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th – The Shuangyashan Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province, a major producer of high-quality coking coal, is making every effort to tap the potential of its old mines and strive for large-scale bumper harvests.

    In April, the old mines of Shuangyashan Coal Mine launched a vigorous red flag competition campaign for high-yield coal production. During the competition, each mine, in light of its own specific conditions, conscientiously applied many of the advanced experiences stipulated and promoted by the Ministry of Coal Industry, achieving significant results. After adopting the advanced experiences of integrated work teams and fast-moving scraper conveyors, the 15112 coal mining team of Lingdong Mine reduced the transport time for each coal cutting from four hours to one hour, enabling the team to increase production from once a day to three times a day. In the past, the No. 2 and No. 7 mines of Lingdong Coal Mine experienced frequent mechanical and roof collapse accidents. After the workers learned from advanced experiences and established systems such as roof inspection and mechanical maintenance, they basically eliminated mechanical, electrical, and roof collapse accidents. Currently, all the coal mining sites in the old mines of Shuangyashan Coal Mine have basically reached the high-yield standard of producing 10,000 tons of coal per month. In April, the old mines overproduced a total of 90,000 tons of raw coal, and the supply of coking coal for washing to Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Iron and Steel has also increased compared to the past.

　　千方百计挖老矿井潜力
    双鸭山大面积丰收
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　盛产优质炼焦煤的黑龙江省双鸭山煤矿，千方百计挖掘老矿井潜力，争取大面积丰收。
    双鸭山煤矿各老矿井在4月份开展了轰轰烈烈的煤炭高额丰产红旗竞赛运动。竞赛中，各矿井结合本身实际情况，认真运用了煤炭工业部规定推广的许多项先进经验，取得了显著效果。岭东矿一五一一二采煤队，推广综合工作队和快速挪刮板运输机的先进经验后，每采割一次煤，运输的时间由四小时缩短到一小时，全队由过去一天只出一次煤变成一天出三次。岭东煤矿二井和七井过去机械和冒顶事故较多，两个井的职工学习先进经验建立顶板验收和机械维护等制度以后，基本上消灭了机电、冒顶等事故。现在，双鸭山煤矿全矿所有老矿井的采煤场子，都基本上达到了月采万吨煤的丰产标准。4月份，各老矿井共超产原煤九万吨，供应鞍钢、本溪钢铁公司的炼焦洗煤也比过去有所增加。
