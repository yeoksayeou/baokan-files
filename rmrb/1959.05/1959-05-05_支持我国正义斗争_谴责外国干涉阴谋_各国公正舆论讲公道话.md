Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Dispatch: "Democratic Korea" published a commentary on April 30, condemning imperialists and Indian expansionists for interfering in China's internal affairs regarding the Tibetan rebellion.

The commentary stated that the Korean people resolutely condemn the shameless conspiratorial activities of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in China's internal affairs, and fully support the resolution on the Tibetan issue adopted by the First Session of the Second National People's Congress of China.

The commentary pointed out that imperialists and some reactionary elements in India have grossly interfered in China's internal affairs regarding the Tibetan rebellion, and have carried out vicious, frantic, and fabricated slanders against China. However, their conspiratorial activities are futile, and none of their conspiracies can weaken the great unity of the 650 million Chinese people, nor can they damage the prestige of the Chinese people.

The commentary stated that the vast majority of the Tibetan people, through their personal experience over the past nine years, have realized the correctness of the national policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. The Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, and the future of the Tibetan people is extremely bright. The resolution on the Tibetan issue adopted by this conference clarified the unwavering policy of the People's Republic of China. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government of China, the broad masses of monks, laypeople, and patriotic figures in Tibet will truly be able to be masters of their own affairs, implement national autonomy in Tibet, and rely on the fraternal unity and mutual assistance of the laboring people of all nationalities in China to build a prosperous and socialist new Tibet.

The commentary warmly congratulated the achievements of the conference. The commentary stated that the issues discussed at the conference and the reports and resolutions adopted showed that the conference summarized the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong in the past period, and demonstrated the power of the unbreakable unity of the Chinese people. The commentary pointed out that this conference was a historically significant event promoting the socialist Great Leap Forward of the 650 million people.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 4th: The "Democratic Youth Daily" in Pyongyang published an editorial today commemorating the "May Fourth" Movement, saying that Korean youth resolutely condemn the imperialists' conspiracy to interfere in China's internal affairs regarding the Tibetan rebellion and fully support the just struggle of the Chinese people.

The "Democratic Youth Daily" editorial stated that Chinese youth, inheriting the revolutionary traditions of the "May Fourth" Movement, have made significant contributions to strengthening the world youth movement and the unity of progressive youth. The editorial also stated that the youth of Korea and China have supported and assisted each other in the historical revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism, and have forged a profound fighting friendship with blood in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, during the Korean War.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 3rd: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published a commentary on the Tibetan rebellion in its "Weekly International Review" on the 2nd.

The commentary said that after Indian Prime Minister Nehru met with the Dalai Lama, it was confirmed that the letter written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan was genuine. Now, the conclusion is very clear that the Dalai Lama went to India not out of his own will. The imperialists' plot to separate Tibet from the territory of the People's Republic of China and use Tibet to achieve their goals of opposing socialist countries has been completely bankrupt.

The newspaper said that the imperialists extend their claws wherever they smell something that can be exploited to intensify international tensions.

Now, normal life in Tibet has been restored, and the active role played by the imperialists in this dirty deal has been exposed to the world. The imperialists were standing behind the Tibetan local reactionaries in this incident.

The commentary said that the criminal activities of the Tibetan reactionary bandits immediately received the support of the imperialists and their lackeys, especially the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They stirred up indescribable clamor. However, their period of rejoicing was very short-lived, and the rebellion was immediately quelled. After the rebellion was quelled, the instigators concentrated all their propaganda firepower to attack the People's Republic of China.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 2nd: The "Hope Daily" in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, published an editorial on April 29th saying that the fact that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni were elected as vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress is powerful evidence of the unity of the Chinese people, and at the same time, this is a fatal blow to imperialism, which attempts to use the Tibetan incident to divide China.

The editorial also said, "Nehru and Menon (according to a weekly magazine in Delhi, they are the 'authors' of the Dalai Lama's statement) and others should recognize their mistakes and look in the mirror of the Bandung Principles to see their political attitude and true colors clearly."

    评论说，朝鲜人民坚决谴责帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政的无耻阴谋活动，并且完全支持中国第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过的关于西藏问题的决议。
    评论指出，帝国主义者和印度的一部分反动分子在西藏叛乱问题上粗暴干涉中国的内政，并且对中国进行恶毒的、疯狂的、虚构的中伤。评论说，但是，他们的这些阴谋活动是徒劳的，他们的任何阴谋策划都不能削弱中国六亿五千万人民的大团结，不可能损坏中国人民的威信。
    评论说，绝大多数的西藏人民通过九年来的亲身经历，已经体验到中国共产党和中央人民政府的民族政策的正确性。评论说，西藏叛乱已经平息，西藏人民的前途是极其光明的。这次会议通过的关于西藏问题的决议阐明了中华人民共和国的坚定不移的政策。在中国中央人民政府的领导下，西藏广大僧俗群众和爱国人士将真正能够当家作主，实行西藏地方的民族自治，并且依靠同中国各族劳动人民的兄弟般的团结和互相帮助，来建设繁荣的、社会主义的新西藏。

    新华社平壤4日电　平壤“民主青年报”今天发表的纪念“五四”运动的社论说，朝鲜青年坚决谴责帝国主义在西藏叛乱问题上干涉中国内政的阴谋，并且全面支持中国人民的正义斗争。
    “民主青年报”的社论说，继承“五四”运动革命传统的中国青年对加强世界青年运动和进步青年的团结作出了重大的贡献。社论还说，朝中两国青年在历史上的反对帝国主义、反对封建主义的革命斗争中，互相支持和声援，在朝鲜的卫国战争时期，反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，以鲜血结成了深厚的战斗友谊。
    新华社索非亚3日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”2日在“每周国际评论”中就西藏叛乱事件发表评论。
    评论说，印度总理尼赫鲁会见达赖喇嘛之后，证实了达赖喇嘛写给谭冠三将军的信是真实的。现在，结论已经非常明显，达赖喇嘛到印度去，并非出于他本人的意愿。帝国主义分子企图把西藏从中华人民共和国的领土中分割出去，并利用西藏来达到反对社会主义国家的目的的阴谋已经彻底破产了。
    这家报纸说，帝国主义分子嗅到什么地方能够渔利，能够加剧国际紧张局势，就把他们的魔爪伸到那里去。
    现在，西藏的正常生活已经重新恢复，帝国主义分子在这一肮脏勾当中所起的积极作用已大白于世了。帝国主义分子在这一次事件中是站在西藏地方反动派的背后的。
    评论说，西藏反动匪帮的罪恶活动立即得到帝国主义分子及其仆从，特别是蒋介石匪帮的支持。他们掀起了不可名状的叫嚣。但是，他们高兴的时间是非常短促的，叛乱被立即平息了。在叛乱被平息之后，煽动者们便集中全部宣传火力，攻击中华人民共和国。

    社论还说，“尼赫鲁和梅农（据德里的一家周刊报道，他们是达赖喇嘛的声明的“作者”）等人应当认识到他们的错误，并且在万隆原则这面镜子上照一下，以便看清他们的政治态度和本来的面目。”
