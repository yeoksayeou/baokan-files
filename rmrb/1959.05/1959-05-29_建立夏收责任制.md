Establish a Summer Harvest Responsibility System
    Fu Jun
      "Gold" is everywhere, old and young are bending down, the tense and busy summer harvest season has arrived.

    This year, summer harvest crops are growing well in various places. How to ensure a bumper harvest is a major issue. "Wheat harvest has five busy tasks: reaping, transporting, threshing, drying, and storing." To ensure a bumper harvest, we must carefully master the five links of reaping, transporting, threshing, drying, and storing. In other words, we must pay attention to the quality of the summer harvest. If we do not pay attention to quality and the harvesting is rough, it will inevitably cause unnecessary losses, and in severe cases, even a bumper harvest cannot be fully realized.

    The establishment of a summer harvest responsibility system in Dianbu People's Commune, Feidong County, Anhui Province, is a noteworthy piece of news. Because this commune established a summer harvest responsibility system, everyone from leaders to commune members has a clear understanding and clear responsibilities. This avoids the phenomenon of no one being responsible and overcomes the shortcomings of rough harvesting, ensuring the quality of the summer harvest. During last year's summer harvest, Dianbu People's Commune suffered losses because the responsibilities were not clearly defined. The Yanggang Production Team's 39 mu of wheat were not harvested in time, and 13 mu were damaged by wind, resulting in a loss of more than 20 jin per mu. This year, the commune implemented the method of "four fixes to the team" (fixing the land area, fixing the time, fixing the quality, and fixing the work points). All teams and groups have generally formulated specific summer harvest pledges. In the summer harvest, they are carefully reaping and threshing, and the quality of the summer harvest is generally very high. Isn't this a very clear contrast!

    To establish a summer harvest responsibility system, we must first widely carry out publicity and education work to overcome the idea that "as long as the crops are harvested well, losing a little doesn't matter." We must make the broad masses realize the great significance of careful harvesting and threshing and strengthen their sense of responsibility for the summer harvest. In fact, as long as the publicity and education work is done well, the commune members' understanding of this point is very profound. After Dianbu People's Commune established the responsibility system, the commune members generally reflected that this year's bumper harvest was not easily obtained. From being busy last year until now, they have worked hard and suffered hardships, and not a single grain of wheat can be wasted. Specifically calculating detailed accounts is a good way to conduct ideological education among the masses. When the Central Brigade of Dianbu People's Commune began harvesting wheat, it was a bit rough. After inspection, they re-threshed it and harvested three more jin of wheat per mu. Losing three or two jin per mu may not seem like a big deal, but when applied to the entire team or commune, it is considerable. The commune members calculated an account: if all the more than 3,000 mu of wheat in the entire brigade were harvested so roughly, they would lose more than 9,000 jin of wheat, and the entire commune would lose more than 81,000 jin. After calculating the account, everyone said that they would not be careless in future harvesting and threshing. It can be seen from this that calculating accounts can greatly increase the commune members' enthusiasm for careful harvesting and threshing. Secondly, to establish a summer harvest responsibility system, we must formulate a set of specific and sound systems. Facts have proved that the method of organizing professional rush harvest teams, fixing land area, fixing time, fixing quality, and fixing work points is a relatively good method. When establishing a responsibility system, all localities should formulate quality standards for the summer harvest, put forward specific requirements for careful harvesting and threshing, and formulate work point standards based on these requirements. Thirdly, after establishing a summer harvest responsibility system, we must also carefully carry out inspection and acceptance work. Those that do not meet the quality standards must be re-done. On the basis of establishing a responsibility system, all communes can organize competitions and comparisons between people, groups, and teams, mobilize commune members to formulate pledges for careful harvesting and threshing, promptly commend and reward units and commune members who do a good job in careful harvesting and threshing, establish role models, resolutely implement the summer harvest responsibility system, and ensure the improvement of summer harvest quality. This year is the first summer harvest after communization. Let us universally establish a summer harvest responsibility system and victoriously fight this battle.

    建立夏收责任制
    傅钧
      “黄金”遍地，老少弯腰，紧张繁忙的夏收季节已经到了。
    今年，各地夏收作物生长良好，如何保证丰产丰收，是一个重大的问题。“麦收有五忙，割、运、碾、晒、藏”，要保证丰产丰收，就必须认真掌握收割、运输、打场、翻晒和保藏五个环节。也就是说，必须重视夏收的质量，如果不讲究质量，收打粗糙，必然会造成不应有的损失，严重的甚至造成丰产不能完全丰收。
    安徽省肥东县店埠人民公社建立夏收责任制是一个值得重视的消息。这个公社由于建立了夏收责任制，从领导到社员，人人心中有数，责任明确，这样就避免了无人负责的现象，克服了收打粗糙的缺点，保证了夏收的质量。店埠人民公社去年夏收中由于责任不够明确，杨岗生产小队三十九亩小麦收割不及时，有十三亩受风灾，每亩少收二十多斤。今年这个公社实行了四定到组的办法，（定田亩、定时间、定质量、定工分），各队、组普遍订立了具体的夏收公约，在夏收中细收细打，夏收质量一般都很高，这不是非常鲜明的对照么！
    建立夏收责任制，首先必须广泛地开展宣传教育工作，克服那种“只要庄稼丰收，丢失一点不算什么”的思想，要使广大群众认识到细收细打的重大意义，加强对夏收的责任心。其实，只要宣传教育工作做得好，社员们对这一点体会是很深刻的。店埠人民公社在建立责任制以后，社员们普遍反映，今年的丰收不是轻易得来的，从去年忙到现在，吃辛受苦，一粒麦子也不能让它浪费掉。具体算细账是对群众进行思想教育的一个好办法。店埠人民公社中心大队开始收打麦子时有些粗糙，经过检查，重新复打，每亩又多打了三斤麦。每亩少收三斤两斤，看起来没有什么了不起，可是推到全队全社却大有可观。社员们算了一笔账：全大队三千多亩麦子，如果每亩都这样收打粗糙，就要少收麦子九千多斤，全社就要少收八万一千多斤。算账以后，大家都表示以后收打一点也不能粗心大意。由此可以看出，算账可以大大提高社员对细收细打的积极性。其次，建立夏收责任制，必须订立一套具体的健全的制度。事实证明，组织抢收专业组，定田亩、定时间、定质量、定工分的办法是比较好的办法。各地在建立责任制的时候，应该订出夏收的质量标准，提出细收细打的具体要求，并根据这些要求订出工分的标准。第三，建立夏收责任制以后，还要认真做好检查验收工作，对不符合质量标准的，必须重新补课。各公社在建立责任制的基础上，可以组织人与人、组与组、队与队之间的评比竞赛，发动社员订好细收细打公约，及时表扬和奖励细收细打做得好的单位和社员，树立榜样，坚决贯彻夏收责任制，保证提高夏收质量。今年是公社化后的第一个夏收，让我们普遍建立夏收责任制，胜利地打好这一仗。
