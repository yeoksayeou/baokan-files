Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - TASS reported from Moscow on the 21st: During a conversation on May 7th with R.K. Karanjia, publisher and editor of the Indian "Blitz" weekly, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nikita Khrushchev stated that the Soviet Union has always supported the Bandung Principles.

Khrushchev said that the countries participating in the Bandung Conference should continue their beneficial work with greater vigor to maintain the spirit established in Bandung. He pointed out that this is very beneficial for maintaining peace.

He emphasized that the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa, which have not joined Western military blocs, have a significant influence on resolving international issues.

Khrushchev said that the enemies of the Soviet Union maliciously fabricate the claim that the Soviet Union wants to "gain a foothold in the Near East through Arab communists." He stressed that aggressive intentions are incompatible with socialist countries.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has always advocated and continues to advocate the principle that the people of each country, as long as they live on their own land, should enjoy all the fruits of their labor. The people of each country determine for themselves which way of life is most suitable for them. The interests, way of life, and culture of the people of each country must be strictly respected.

Referring to the current conflict between the Republic of Iraq and the United Arab Republic, Khrushchev said that some people in the UAR want to incorporate Iraq into the UAR. But the people of Iraq are unwilling to do so. As a result, various conflicts and even conspiracies have arisen.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the national liberation movements of the Arab peoples has not changed and will not change in the future. This attitude is based on the Leninist principle of friendship between all countries. He said that we have sympathized with and helped, and will continue to help, the liberation struggle of all peoples to achieve victory.

Khrushchev pointed out that those who weaken the unity of the Arab peoples are making a big mistake. Khrushchev said that this refers to the current relationship between the UAR and Iraq. He said that because of this action, the people of the two Arab countries are wasting their energy on a struggle between one Arab country and another, instead of using it on a common struggle against the real enemy - imperialism.

Khrushchev hoped that the leaders of the Arab countries would understand that they must deal with the situation wisely, resolve conflicts, and not give the enemies of the Arabs the opportunity to use these conflicts to achieve selfish goals.

Khrushchev said that we would, of course, be very happy if the Arab countries lived in peace and friendship and united against the colonialists. But this situation can only be achieved if a strict policy of non-interference is pursued.

In answering a question, Khrushchev said that there are no conflicts between the Soviet Union and the UAR. In the future, we still intend to build our relations with the UAR on the basis of equality, respect for sovereignty, and mutual benefit. The Soviet Union has never interfered in, and does not want to interfere in, the internal affairs of other countries. He emphasized that the various peoples of the UAR have no more loyal or reliable friend than the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev continued by saying that everyone knows what role the Soviet Union played in stopping the aggression against Egypt and eliminating the threat of invasion against Syria.

Khrushchev said that Mr. Nasser might become a horse under the saddle of the United States. Then he would understand from practice what the socialist policy of the Soviet Union is and what the policy of the United States is. Now, this is still hidden from people, but we already know what methods the United States wants to use to saddle the UAR.

Khrushchev said that if the leaders of the UAR are unwilling to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union now, then that is their business, and we can withstand it. If there is a loss as a result, then the loser will certainly not be the Soviet Union. However, we are willing to maintain friendly relations, because this will be beneficial to both of our countries, especially to the people of the Arab countries, and to the people of all countries struggling against colonialism.

Khrushchev said that Mr. Karanjia's understanding of the actual situation is correct, that is, he does not believe in such a slander: saying that the Soviet Union and China have begun to implement a policy of strength in some regions of the world, and that between the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU, the Soviet Union's policy has changed. (What Karanjia was referring to was: some Westerners have said that if the Soviet Union formerly supported bourgeois national governments even when friction occurred between them and local communists, now the opposite is true, and the Soviet Union supports local communists even when conflicts arise between them and the local national bourgeois governments.)

Khrushchev said that we still adhere to the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress. Recently, there has been no slightest change in the foreign policy of the Soviet government. We have always advocated and continue to advocate establishing good and normal relations with all countries with different national systems and social systems.

Khrushchev said that making some criticisms of Mr. Nasser does not violate the Soviet Union's policy of non-interference in his country's internal affairs. We defend communism as a doctrine, because President Nasser has made many distortions of communism. Khrushchev emphasized that we have done this in the past and will continue to do so firmly in the future.

Khrushchev reminded that despite more than a hundred years of attacks against communists, none of the attackers have achieved anything. Fascist Germany was stronger than Egypt, and at that time Hitler fought against communism from a belligerent chauvinistic position under the banner of anti-communism. Earlier, Mussolini had also taken such actions. They are long gone, and communist ideology has become the banner and guiding ideology of many countries in Europe and Asia with nearly one billion people.

Khrushchev said that a clear line should be drawn. Communist doctrine is one thing, and the internal systems of various countries are another. We have always recognized and continue to recognize that the people of all countries have the right to choose the system they like at that time. Let the people of the UAR live as they wish, and let them establish the system they like there. This is their internal affair.

Khrushchev said that as far as he knows, the communists in Arab countries are not currently proposing the construction of a communist society as their specific task. What they are currently fighting for is: striving for freedom and independence for their countries, striving for peace and to completely free their countries from the oppression of imperialism, and striving to solve the economic and social development problems that these young countries can afford.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's economic achievements not only will, but already are, bringing great benefits to underdeveloped countries.

In answering another question from Mr. Karanjia, Khrushchev said that if the Indian government requests the Soviet Union to grant a loan, then the Soviet government will discuss this issue and will study what possibilities there are. He said that our Indian friends need not doubt that we are willing and will be willing to provide assistance now and in the future.

    赫鲁晓夫对印度“闪电”周报发行人发表谈话
    阿拉伯人民应致力于反帝共同斗争
    苏联是阿联人民最可靠的朋友愿同阿联保持友好关系
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在5月7日同印度“闪电”周报发行人兼编辑卡朗吉亚的谈话中说，苏联过去和现在一直支持万隆原则。
    赫鲁晓夫说，参加万隆会议的国家应当以更大的精力继续它们的有益的事业，以保持住在万隆创立的精神。他指出，这对维护和平很有利。
    他着重指出，没有参加西方国家军事集团的亚非爱好和平的国家对解决国际问题有重大影响。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的敌人硬说苏联想要“通过阿拉伯的共产主义者在近东扎根”，这是恶意的捏造。他强调说，侵略意图对社会主义国家是格格不入的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联过去和现在一直主张承认这样一种原则：每个国家的人民，只要生活在自己的土地上，就应当享受自己劳动的一切果实。每个国家的人民自己确定，那种生活方式对他们最合适。必须严格尊重每个国家人民的利益、生活方式和文化。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到目前伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国之间的冲突时说，阿联有些人想把伊拉克并入阿联。但是伊拉克人民不愿意这样做。于是就产生了各种冲突，甚至阴谋。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联对阿拉伯各国人民的民族解放运动的态度现在没有改变，将来也不会改变。这种态度是以列宁主义的各国友好的原则为出发点的。他说，我们过去同情和帮助过，将来仍然要帮助各国人民的解放斗争获得胜利。
  　赫鲁晓夫指出，那些削弱阿拉伯各国人民的团结的人犯了很大错误。赫鲁晓夫说，这指的是阿联和伊拉克之间的目前关系。他说，由于这种行动，两个阿拉伯国家的人民把自己的精力白白浪费在一个阿拉伯国家同另一个阿拉伯国家进行的斗争上，而不是用在反对真正的敌人——帝国主义的共同斗争上。
    赫鲁晓夫希望阿拉伯国家的领导人明白，必须明智地对待出现的局势，解决冲突，不给阿拉伯人的敌人有可能利用这种冲突达到自私的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果阿拉伯国家生活在和平和友谊之中，并联合起来反对殖民主义者，我们当然很高兴。但是这种局面只有在奉行严格的不干涉政策的情况下才能达到。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答问题时说，苏联和阿联之间没有任何冲突。今后我们仍然打算把我们同阿联的关系建立在平等、尊重主权和互利的基础上。苏联从来没有干涉过，而且也不想干涉别国的内政。他强调指出，阿联的各族人民再没有比苏联更忠实、更可靠的朋友了。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，大家都知道，苏联在制止对埃及的侵略和消除进犯叙利亚的威胁方面起了怎样的作用。
    赫鲁晓夫说，纳赛尔先生可能成为美国的鞍下之马。那时他就会从实际中了解，苏联的社会主义政策是什么，美国的政策是什么。现在，这点还瞒着人们，但是，我们已经知道，美国想用什么办法给阿联备上鞍子。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果阿联的领导人现在不愿意和苏联保持友好关系，那么，这是他们的事情，我们是可以经受得住的。如果由此而遭到损失，那么，受损者决不是苏联。然而，我们愿意保持友好关系，因为这对我们两国都会有好处，特别是对阿拉伯国家人民，对同殖民主义者进行斗争的一切国家的人民有好处。
    赫鲁晓夫说，卡朗吉亚先生对实际情况的了解是正确的，即不相信这样一种诽谤：说什么苏联以及中国已开始在世界的某些地区实行实力政策，说什么在苏共第二十次和第二十一次代表大会之间，苏联的政策有所改变。（卡朗吉亚所指的是：西方某些人士有这样一种说法，他们说，如果说苏联从前甚至在资产阶级民族政府和当地的共产党发生磨擦的时候支持了这种政府，那么现在则恰恰相反，苏联甚至在当地共产党同当地的民族资产阶级政府发生冲突的时候，支持地方共产党。）
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们仍然坚持第二十次党代表大会的决议。最近以来，苏联政府在外交政策方面没有丝毫改变。我们过去和现在一直主张同不同国家制度和社会制度的各国建立良好的、正常的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，对纳赛尔先生提出一些批评，并不违反苏联不干涉他国内政的政策。我们捍卫共产主义是把它作为一门学说来捍卫的，因为纳赛尔总统对共产主义作了许多歪曲。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，我们过去这样做，今后仍将坚决地这样做。
  　赫鲁晓夫提醒说，对共产党人的进攻尽管进行了一百多年，但是没有那个进攻者得到什么成就。法西斯德国曾比埃及强盛，当时希特勒打着反共旗子，从好战的沙文主义立场向共产主义展开斗争。再早一些时候，墨索里尼也曾采取过这样的行动。他们早已不在人间了，而共产主义思想却成了近十亿人口的欧亚许多国家的旗帜和主导的意识形态。
  　赫鲁晓夫说，应当划清界线。共产主义学说是一回事，各国的内部制度是另一回事。我们过去和现在都承认，各国人民有权选择他们当时所喜欢的那种制度。让阿联的人们像他们所希望的那样生活吧，让那里建立他们所喜欢的那种制度吧。这是他们的内政。
    赫鲁晓夫说，据他所知，阿拉伯国家共产党人现在并没有把建设共产主义社会提作自己的具体任务。他们目前所进行的斗争是：争取本国的自由和独立，争取和平和使本国完全摆脱帝国主义的压迫，争取解决这些年轻的国家力所能及的经济和社会发展的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的经济成就不仅会，而且已经在给不发达的国家带来很大好处。
    在回答卡朗吉亚先生的另一个问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，如果印度政府请求苏联给予贷款，那么苏联政府将讨论这个问题，并将研究有哪些可能。他说，我们的印度朋友可以不必怀疑，我们现在和将来都愿意给予援助。
