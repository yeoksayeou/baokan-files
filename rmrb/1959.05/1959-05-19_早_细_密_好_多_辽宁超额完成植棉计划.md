Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 18th: Liaoning Province had sown more than 3.08 million mu of cotton by May 10th, exceeding the state-assigned cotton planting plan by 2.8%. Currently, the early-sown cotton has already emerged.

This year, Liaoning's cotton was planted early, finely, densely, and well. Many areas, based on last year's experience of increased production through early planting, broke with convention and began plowing and planting cotton before Grain Rain, completing the sowing task ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. Before sowing, most cotton fields were deep-plowed, and seeds were carefully selected. Generally, local high-quality cotton varieties were selected, and 15% of the cotton fields were replanted with high-yielding new varieties such as "1298", "Woji No. 1", "Mizi Cotton", "Dai Zi Cotton" and "Jinyu No. 5" which have been cultivated and tested. Cotton fields also widely promoted yield-increasing measures such as rational close planting and increased application of manure, so the sowing quality has been greatly improved compared with previous years.

    早·细·密·好·多
    辽宁超额完成植棉计划
    新华社沈阳18日电　辽宁省到5月10日止共播种棉花三百零八万多亩，超额2.8％完成了国家下达的种棉计划。目前，播种早的已经出苗。
    今年辽宁的棉花种得早、细、密、好。很多地区都根据去年早种增产的经验，打破常规在谷雨前开犁种棉，比往年提前十天到半月完成了播种任务。在播种前，大部分棉田都经过深翻，种籽经过精选。一般都选种了当地的优良棉种，并有15％的棉田换种了“一二九八”、“窝及一号”、“密字棉”、“岱字棉”和“锦育五号”等经过培育试验的高产新品种。各棉田还普遍推行了合理密植和增施粪肥等增产措施，因而播种质量比往年有很大提高。
