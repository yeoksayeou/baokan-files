Haicheng's Bright May Day

A Great Leap Forward in Six Industries

"Haicheng in May, a bright sunny day, lush seedlings and strong livestock herald a bumper year; fishing boats return fully loaded, sails billowing; flowers and fruits fragrant, celebrating leadership." This is a vivid picture of the rural areas of Haicheng County in southern Fujian Province today.

Haicheng County has implemented the policy of focusing on grain production while comprehensively developing diversified economic production. This year, agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have continued to leap forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. Over 160,000 mu of early rice, peanuts, soybeans, and sugarcane and other spring-sown crops are growing well. Most of the early rice has thick stalks and strong leaves, and the early transplanted rice has already headed and is flowering; soybeans and peanuts have also blossomed and set pods. Orchards scattered throughout the countryside exude an intoxicating fragrance. Loquats and bayberries are already on the market in large quantities, while honey peaches, lychees, and longans are laden with fruit, and citrus is in full bloom. The area of orchards this year has expanded by more than 4,000 mu compared to last year. To date, the county has afforested a total area of 118,000 mu, exceeding the original annual afforestation plan by more than 28,000 mu, an increase of more than 53,000 mu compared to the total afforestation area last year, and the survival rate of seedlings has also improved compared to last year. Under the slogan of "Fish fill the ponds, salt fills the streams, poultry in flocks, and livestock thrive," the total number of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and other domestic animals in the county has increased from more than 117,000 at the end of February to more than 138,000, not including the more than 100,000 newly hatched chicks from the communes. Haicheng County is also an aquatic product area, where marine fishing and freshwater aquaculture can be carried out. Through the efforts of coastal fishermen and aquaculture professional teams in various communes, the current output of marine fish has increased by more than 10% compared to the same period last year, while freshwater aquaculture has increased by several times to more than 200 times compared to the same period last year. Commune members all say: The first spring of the people's commune is a spring of a Great Leap Forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fisheries and fruit production.

Fiery Production Competition

In this season of flourishing growth, commune members, seeing the fruits of their hard work blossoming and bearing fruit, are even more spirited and full of vigor. The short-term competitions in rice transplanting, weeding, etc., carried out between production teams and production teams, and between commune members and commune members, in various communes throughout the county have just ended, and the competition to topdress panicle fertilizer, prevent pests and diseases, and do all field management work has begun enthusiastically. Since last winter, many production brigades, production teams, and commune members have been commended and rewarded by the Haicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and competition evaluation organizations at all levels for their participation in short-term competitions such as deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and spring plowing and transplanting. In the currently unfolding competition to strengthen field management, many new advanced units and commune members have emerged. This county-wide, phased, and well-organized competition, combined with the widespread implementation of labor quotas and excess reward systems, has made commune members' enthusiasm grow even greater, and the communist spirit of mutual cooperation has been further developed. The 20 production teams of the Liming Production Brigade, one of the most advanced production brigades in the county, have promoted, helped, and learned from each other in four consecutive short-term competitions, and twice everyone achieved complete success.

The competition between the male youth Zhao Yun Assault Team and the female youth Mu Guiying Assault Team of the Fifth Production Team of the Houjing Production Brigade has lasted for several months, but so far, it is still uncertain who will win. In the rice transplanting competition, the female team members transplanted at least 300 bundles of rice per person per day, and the male team members also completed and over-fulfilled the original rice transplanting competition conditions. Once, the female team members decided to win by skill: they ate lunch in the field and rested in the field in order to work more. But this "secret" was quickly discovered by the young men who were always paying attention to the girls' movements, and they immediately did the same.

"Eight Immortals" Achieve Fame Through Fertilizer Accumulation

This year, Haicheng County has added a new labor force compared to the Great Leap Forward of last spring. These are the vast numbers of young women who have just been liberated from tedious housework after the implementation of communal dining in the communes. Since last year, they have diligently studied and practiced, and more than 80% of them have learned farming techniques such as plowing and transplanting rice.

Hong Bopi, Yang Lugui, Liu Xiyu, Su Meiqing, Chen Qinghua, Xu Chi, Xu Ni and Cai Xiulan, eight young mothers and girls from the Chengguan Production Brigade of the Lianhua Commune, not only quickly learned plowing, harrowing, transplanting and other techniques, but also learned to drive tractors to plow fields, working as well as male commune members, and some even surpassed male commune members, so they were called "Eight Immortals." At first, some male commune members were unconvinced and decided to compete with them. They selected 25 people to form a fertilizer accumulation assault team and launched a red flag competition with the "Eight Immortals," intending to stump the "Eight Immortals" by accumulating river mud. But the "Eight Immortals" did not show weakness, and they also organized a 25-person women's fertilizer accumulation assault team to compete with the men. The result of the competition: the men overfulfilled their task of accumulating river mud, but the women's group's results were a quarter more than theirs, and the red flag was taken by the "Eight Immortals." In subsequent competitions such as transplanting rice, thinning seedlings, and weeding, the "Eight Immortals" also competed equally with the male commune members. In this way, the fame of the "Eight Immortals" spread throughout the brigade and the entire commune.

    海澄五月艳阳天
    陈启桐　林嘉煌
    六业大跃进
    “海澄五月艳阳天，苗肥畜壮兆丰年；渔船满载鼓帆返，花果芬芳庆领先”。这是福建省南部海澄县当前农村的一片生动景象。
    海澄县贯彻了以粮食生产为主，全面发展多种经济生产的方针，今年农林牧副渔的生产在去年大跃进的基础上继续跃进。全县十六万多亩早稻、花生、大豆和甘蔗等春播春种作物长得很好。早稻大都秆粗叶壮，插秧早的已经抽穗扬花；大豆、花生也已开花结荚。遍布在村野之间的果园里，散发着醉人的幽香，枇杷、杨梅已经大量上市，水蜜桃、荔枝和龙眼又已结实累累，柑桔正繁花盛开。今年果园面积比去年扩大了四千多亩。到目前止，全县造林面积共达十一万八千多亩，超过原订全年造林计划二万八千多亩，比去年全年造林面积总和增加了五万三千多亩，树苗成活率也比去年有了提高。在“鱼满塘、盐满溪、家禽成群、六畜兴旺”的口号下，全县现有牛、羊和猪、鸡等家禽家畜存栏头数已由2月底的十一万七千多头增加到十三万八千多头，各公社新孵出的十多万只幼禽尚未计算在内。海澄县也是一个水产区，可进行海洋捕捞和淡水养殖。经过沿海渔民和各公社养殖专业队的努力，现有海鱼产量比去年同期增加一成多，淡水养殖则比去年同期增加数倍到两百多倍。社员们都说：人民公社化的第一个春天，是农林牧副渔和水果生产六业大跃进的春天。
  生产竞赛热火朝天
    在这万物欣欣向荣的季节里，眼看自己辛勤劳动正在开花结果的社员们，更是意气风发，干劲冲天。全县各公社的生产队和生产队、社员与社员之间开展的插秧、除草等短期竞赛刚刚结束，追施穗肥，防止病虫害，作好一切田间管理工作的竞赛，又热烈展开。从去年冬季以来，有许多生产大队、生产队和社员，在深翻地、积肥、春耕插秧等短期竞赛中，受到了中共海澄县委和各级竞赛评比组织的表扬和奖励。目前展开的加强田间管理竞赛中，又有许多新的先进单位和社员涌现出来。这种席卷全县的分期分段、有始有终的竞赛运动，结合劳动定额和超额奖励等制度的广泛推行，社员们的干劲越赛越大，相互协作的共产主义精神也得到更大发扬。全县生产最先进的大队之一的黎明生产大队的二十个生产队，在连续四次短期竞赛中，各队相互推动、相互帮助、相互学习，有两次大家都是满堂红。
    厚境生产大队第五生产队的男青年赵云突击队和女青年的穆桂英突击队之间的竞赛，已持续数月之久，但至今还是胜负不分。插秧竞赛中，女队员每人每天至少插秧三百把以上，男队员每人每天也都完成和超额完成了原订插秧竞赛条件。有一次女队员决定来个以巧取胜：中午在田间吃饭，在田间休息，以便争取多干活。但这个“秘密”很快就被时刻注意着姑娘们动静的小伙子们知道了，他们也马上这样作起来。 　　 “八仙女”
    积肥扬名
    今年，在海澄县比大跃进的去年春天新增添了一支劳动生力军，这就是在公社实行食堂化以后，刚从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来的广大青年妇女。她们在去年以来勤学苦练，已有80％以上的人学会了犁田、插秧等耕作技术。
    莲花公社城关生产大队洪薄皮、杨陆桂、刘细玉、苏美卿、陈清花、许赤、许泥和蔡秀兰等八个年青母亲和姑娘们，不但很快学会了犁、耙、插秧等技术，还学会了驾驶拖拉机耕田，干起活来和男社员不相上下，有的还能超过男社员，因此被称为“八仙女”。开始时，有些男社员不服气，决心要和她们比个高低。他们挑选了二十五个人组成积肥突击队，和“八仙女”展开红旗竞赛，打算用积河泥这一着把“八仙女”难倒。但是“八仙女”并不示弱，她们也组织了一支二十五人的妇女积肥突击队和男子比赛。比赛结果：男子挑积河泥超额完成了任务，可是女子组的成绩又比他们多了四分之一，红旗被“八仙女”夺了去。在以后开展的插秧、间苗、除草等竞赛中，“八仙女”也都和男社员比个平手。就这样，“八仙女”的英名在全大队和全公社传开了。
