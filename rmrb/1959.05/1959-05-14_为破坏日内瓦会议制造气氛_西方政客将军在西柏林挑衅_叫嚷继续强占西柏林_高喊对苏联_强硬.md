Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 13th: According to TASS correspondent Ivanov's report from Berlin on May 13th: Those who oppose easing international tensions are intensifying their provocative activities in West Berlin recently, in an attempt to worsen the international situation and undermine East-West talks.

Such provocations are not only manifested in the fact that American senior generals "visiting" West Berlin on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference clamor "not to hesitate to fight for Berlin," and that American aircraft repeatedly violate the flight rules of the air corridor from West Germany to West Berlin. Moreover, those who oppose easing international tensions are doing even more.

On the second day of the opening of the Geneva Conference, the West Berlin municipal government, led by (West Berlin Mayor) Brandt, took another action in an attempt to worsen the Berlin situation and the political atmosphere during the Geneva Conference - "celebrating" the tenth anniversary of the end of the so-called "blockade of West Berlin." American, British, and French generals and politicians responsible for the division of Berlin and for turning West Berlin into a so-called "frontline city," such as American General Clay and General Taylor, former British Labour Party leader Attlee, and former French Prime Minister Schuman, attended the "celebration" ceremony. The Bonn government, which approved and supported this provocation, sent several ministers and the President of the West German Senate, Kaiser, to attend the ceremony, as well as the families of the American, British, and French pilots who died in the flights between West Germany and West Berlin in 1949.

At this so-called "celebration" ceremony, shameless accusations were made against the Soviet Union, insisting that the Soviet Union was responsible for these victims caused in 1949 by the Western countries' implementation of the "Cold War" policy. West Berlin newspapers and radio stations have also launched a deceptive and defamatory campaign against the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's foreign policy on the Berlin issue in recent days.

The climax of this "celebration" was a conference held on the 13th. Kaiser, Clay, Brandt, and others delivered speeches at the conference. They incited the maintenance of the occupation regime in West Berlin and demanded that the Western governments maintain a "tough" stance toward the Soviet Union.

The West Berlin reactionaries launched this provocation during the Geneva Conference in an attempt to exert pressure on the Geneva Conference. The West German and West Berlin reactionary forces, supported by certain people in Western countries, are desperately trying to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German question and attempt to continue the Cold War.

    为破坏日内瓦会议制造气氛
    西方政客将军在西柏林挑衅
    叫嚷继续强占西柏林  高喊对苏联“强硬”
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社记者伊凡诺夫13日自柏林报道：反对缓和国际紧张局势的人，为了设法恶化国际局势、破坏东西方会谈，最近在西柏林加紧了他们的挑衅活动。
    这种挑衅不仅表现在这样一些事实上：在日内瓦外长会议前夕“访问”西柏林的美国高级将领们叫嚷“不惜为柏林而战”，美国飞机再三破坏西德至西柏林空中走廊的飞行规则。而且，这些反对缓和国际紧张局势的人做得还更多。
    就在日内瓦会议开幕的第二天，在（西柏林市长）勃兰特领导下的西柏林市政府就采取了另一次企图恶化柏林形势和日内瓦会议期间政治空气的行动——“庆祝”所谓“封锁西柏林”结束十周年。美国、英国、法国的将军们和应对柏林的分裂和使西柏林变成所谓“前线城市”负责的政客，如美国的克莱将军、泰勒将军，英国前工党领袖艾德礼，法国前总理舒曼等，出席了这次“庆祝”典礼。赞成和支持这次挑衅的波恩政府派了几位部长和西德参议院的议长凯森出席典礼，出席的还有1949年在往来于西德和西柏林之间的飞行中失事丧命的美英法飞行员的家属。
    在这个所谓“庆祝”仪式上，对苏联进行了无耻的指责，硬说苏联要对由于西方国家执行“冷战”政策而在1949年造成的这些牺牲者负责。西柏林的报纸和电台最近几天也对苏联和苏联关于西柏林问题的外交政策发动了一次欺骗和毁谤运动。
    这次“庆祝”活动的最高点是13日举行的一次大会。凯森、克莱和勃兰特等人都在这次会上发表了演说。他们煽动保持西柏林的占领制度，要求西方国家政府对苏联保持“强硬”立场。
    西柏林反动派在日内瓦会议期间发动这一次挑衅，是企图对日内瓦会议施加压力。受西方国家某些人士支持的西德和西柏林的反动力量正在拼命阻挠和平解决德国问题并且企图继续进行冷战。
