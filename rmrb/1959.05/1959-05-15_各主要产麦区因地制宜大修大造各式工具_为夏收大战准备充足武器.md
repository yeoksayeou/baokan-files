Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric - Shandong Province is rushing to repair and manufacture summer harvest tools in various places. According to statistics from five special districts including Liaocheng, Jining, and Yantai, more than 3 million pieces of various harvesting tools such as sickles, fast harvesters, and hand-cranked harvesters have been prepared. More than 8,100 threshers, threshing machines, and stone rollers have been modified and created. At present, these areas have basically prepared all kinds of tools needed for the summer harvest.

In preparing small summer harvest tools, people's communes in Shandong adopted the method of repairing first and then manufacturing, trying to utilize and repair the original tools as much as possible. Qihe County organized more than 2,500 iron and woodworking workers to go deep into production teams. In nearly ten days, they repaired more than 22,000 pieces of small tools such as sickles, wooden forks, row rakes, and winnowing shovels.

According to the new situation this year, such as close planting of wheat, wide rows, many plants per clump, strong stalks, unified improved varieties, and concentrated maturity period, the people's communes in Linyi and Liaocheng special districts overcame complacency about this year's summer harvest work by arranging wheat fields, calculating labor, arranging tools, and calculating time. Tool preparation was especially sufficient, with sickles alone increasing by about 30% compared to last year.

While vigorously developing wheat harvesting and threshing tools, all localities paid close attention to the production and repair of tools for threshing yards and rain gear. Changwei Special District has produced and repaired more than 262,000 wooden shovels and more than 580,000 wooden forks and row rakes. People's communes in Qihe, Chiping and other counties have also made more than 13,360 straw mats.

In preparing summer harvest tools, all localities paid special attention to reforming and popularizing new-style tools. Five special districts including Yantai and Linyi, and thirty counties including Yexian and Zhucheng, have successfully trial-produced dozens of various hand-cranked harvesters, threshing harvesters, new-style sickles, power harvesters, horse-drawn harvesters, and threshers. After repeated trials and appraisals by cadres, workers, and peasants, the efficiency of these tools is generally one to ten times higher than that of the original old-style tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th - Shanxi Province is greatly modifying and manufacturing new summer harvest tools through evaluation and identification, sample selection and finalization. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction held a provincial on-site meeting for the evaluation of summer harvest tools in Xijiang Town, Houma City, Jinan, a wheat-producing area. More than 400 skilled craftsmen and agricultural implement scientific and technical personnel from various parts of the province adopted on-site demonstrations, introductions by indigenous and foreign experts, and mass evaluation methods to evaluate 15 kinds of harvesting, transportation, and threshing new tools with high efficiency, wide adaptability, low cost, convenient materials, simple structure, and easy promotion. The meeting decided to promote these tools in a way that suits local conditions throughout the province.

At present, a campaign to greatly manufacture, greatly modify, greatly repair, and greatly promote new summer harvest tools has taken initial shape in major summer harvest areas. According to incomplete statistics from Wenxi, Jishan, Pinglu, Houma and other counties and cities in Jinan, the main wheat-producing area, more than 500,000 new summer harvest tools have been reformed and promoted recently.

This year, all localities have generally adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods in preparing summer harvest tools. On the one hand, larger machines with high efficiency and perfect structure are promoted and used, and on the other hand, attention is paid to modifying simple and easy-to-use small tools. While reforming and promoting larger summer harvest tools, Jishan County is focusing on improving the application of existing summer harvest tools and increasing the manufacture of small new tools, making the existing vehicles rolling bearing; installing bearings on 3,000 old fan vehicles; and manufacturing 10,000 wooden pulley push forks.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th - Henan Province has adopted eight measures of "finding, digging, repairing, making, modifying, picking, substituting, and adjusting" to vigorously grasp the manufacturing and improvement of summer harvest tools, and has achieved remarkable results. By the end of April, Xinyang Special District had modified 12 million small summer harvest farm tools, accounting for 72% of the total plan; by May 5, Xuchang Special District had modified more than 88% of the planned summer harvest farm tools. The modification plans of other special districts have also been completed very well.

Due to the shortage of raw materials and busy transportation, all localities in Henan have conscientiously implemented the policy of relying on the masses for self-reliance, obtaining materials locally, producing locally, and supplying locally in preparing summer harvest tools. All localities have mobilized the masses to adopt measures such as tapping potential, finding lost tools, repairing damaged tools, picking waste piles, making substitutes, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and manufacturing and improving tools to fully prepare various wheat harvest tools.

Shangqiu Special District launched a large-scale repair and replenishment campaign focusing on mulberry forks, tendon forks, brooms, sickles, and hoes. In nearly ten days, it repaired 2.85 million various damaged small farm tools. The commercial departments of this special district picked out more than 115,000 small farm tools such as sickles, hoes, iron shovels, plowshares, and adzes with minor damage from the old scrap iron piles. After repairing and adding steel, they can still be supplied to farmers.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient supply of some farm tools, all localities have tried to make many substitutes to make up for it. Huaiyang County used mulberry branches, jujube branches, and wooden poles to make more than 6,000 mulberry forks, and used elm branches, mulberry branches, and willow branches to make 17,000 brooms. Gongxian and Mixian found more than 2,200 firewood brooms to replace bamboo brooms.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an - In the summer harvest preparation work, people's communes in Shaanxi Province paid special attention to the inspection and storage of small farm tools such as sickles, brooms, fork handles, whetstones, and cloth bags. At present, the supply and marketing cooperatives and stores of many communes are working day and night to purchase and sell various small summer harvest farm tools. The more than 2,000 laborers in Yijun People's Commune in Huangling County have an average of one sickle per laborer, one broom and one wooden fork for every two people, and also have enough whetstones, bamboo baskets, carrying poles, etc. for wheat harvest. After inspection, the summer harvest small farm tools of more than 150 people's communes in more than 20 counties and cities such as Qianxian, Xianyang, and Chang'an have been supplemented according to needs.

In previous years, the harvesting and threshing of summer harvest crops in Shaanxi Province mainly relied on small farm tools. Although some new-style harvesting tools have been promoted in various places last year and this year, their number is small, and most of them are still in the trial stage. Therefore, the vast majority of more than 20 million mu of wheat in the province still relies on sickle harvesting, and wooden forks, brooms and other tools are mainly used in the wheat field. In response to this situation, all people's communes paid close attention to the inspection and preparation of small farm tools. Through careful calculation, according to the amount of summer harvest crops, the number of full and half labor forces, they formulated a plan for supplementing small farm tools, and mobilized the masses to find sources of small farm tools in every possible way. As early as a month ago, the Xijia Production Team of the Xinfeng People's Commune in Lintong County calculated that this year's summer harvest workload would double compared to last year, and the most needed small farm tools were short of more than 400 pieces, and some of the existing small farm tools were also damaged and needed to be repaired. Through this calculation, the erroneous understanding that "small farm tools are not important, just put them together when the time comes" was corrected. All members of the team repaired small farm tools, and after more than 20 days of hard work, the sickles, pockets, rain-proof straw curtains, trolleys, and wooden forks needed for summer harvest were all prepared, and special personnel were assigned to take care of these small farm tools. Wang Baojing, a national agricultural labor model, concentrated dozens of skilled craftsmen to establish 20 small farm tool repair and assembly plants, repaired more than 14,000 small farm tools in more than four days, and inspected and accepted each of the 23 production teams in the commune to fully implement the storage of small farm tools.

The commercial departments in all parts of the province also actively organized sources of goods to supply small summer harvest farm tools. According to incomplete statistics, commercial departments have supplied more than 20 million small summer harvest farm tools to various places. The staff of the Agricultural Production Wholesale Department of the Xi'an Municipal Civil Materials Store launched a red flag competition to organize the supply of small summer harvest farm tools. This wholesale department conducted an early investigation on the small farm tools needed by the people's communes in the suburbs, and signed production and sales contracts with more than 50 factories, school practice factories, and production service cooperatives according to needs. More than 240,000 sickles, more than 40,000 sickle handles, and a large number of vehicle harnesses, pockets, etc. have now been transported to stores in the suburbs.

Beijing News - While strengthening the later management of wheat fields, many people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing are actively repairing and manufacturing agricultural machinery and tools, arranging labor, and preparing for the summer harvest.

All communes in Tongzhou District have transferred responsible cadres to specifically lead the wheat harvest preparation work. In addition to mobilizing the masses to vigorously reform tools and trying to give full play to the effectiveness of existing power machinery, they also rationally arrange farm work to do a good job in plowing the grain fields three times and controlling pests in cotton fields before the wheat harvest, so as to concentrate efforts on rushing to harvest during the wheat harvest.

The relevant departments in Beijing have prepared some combine harvesters, horse-drawn harvesters, and wheat threshers for the wheat harvest. Many communes have also tried to organize farm tool repair and manufacturing plants to repair various harvesting machines and farm tools on the one hand, and manufacture improved simple harvesters and new-style sickles on the other hand. The Hongxing People's Commune in Daxing District has repaired the four combine harvesters and one thresher used for wheat harvest, and is compiling the route of the machine's action during the summer harvest. The Liqiao Commune in Shunyi District has manufactured hand-pushed and horse-drawn harvesters that can harvest about 30 mu per day. The iron and woodworking factories of various people's communes in Tongzhou District are concentrating their efforts to rush to produce wheat harvest tools such as sickles and sand rakes.

    各主要产麦区因地制宜大修大造各式工具
    为夏收大战准备充足武器
    山东
    新华社济南电　山东省各地突击检修赶制夏收工具。据聊城、济宁、烟台等五个专区的统计，现已准备好镰刀、快速收割机、手摇收割机等各种收割工具三百多万件，改制和创制各种脱粒机、脱粒器和石滚八千一百多件。目前这些地区已基本上备足了夏收需要的各种工具。
    山东各地人民公社在准备夏收小型工具中，采取先修理后制造的办法，尽量利用和修理原有的工具。齐河县组织了二千五百多名铁木工人深入生产队，在近十天内就修好镰刀、木杈、排杈、木耙、扬场锨等小工具二万二千多件。
    临沂、聊城专区各人民公社根据今年小麦密植宽幅株多秸壮和良种统一、成熟期集中等新情况，通过排麦田、算劳力、排工具、算时间，克服了对今年夏收工作的麻痹思想，工具准备的特别充足，仅镰刀一项就比去年增加30％左右。
    各地在大搞小麦收割、脱粒工具的同时，还十分注意生产、检修打场用的工具和防雨用具。昌潍专区目前已生产和修理木锨二十六万二千多张，木杈、排杈等五十八万多个。齐河、茌平等县各人民公社还打好草苫一万三千三百六十多盘。
    在准备夏收工具中，各地特别重视改革推广新式工具，烟台、临沂等五个专区和掖县、诸城等三十个县，已试制成功各种手摇收割机、脱粒收割机、新式镰刀和动力收割机、马拉收割机、脱粒机达几十种，仅临沂专区和掖县赶制的新式收割农具就有三十五万多件。这些工具经过干部、工人、农民的多次试验、鉴定，工效一般都比原来旧式工具提高一倍至十倍。
    山西
    本报太原14日电　山西省各地通过评比鉴定、选样定型，大改大造夏收新工具。最近，山西省农业建设厅在产麦区晋南侯马市郊新绛镇举行了全省夏收工具评比现场会议，来自全省各地的四百多个公社的能工巧匠和农具科学技术人员，采取现场表演、土洋专家介绍、群众性评比的方法，评比出十五种工效高、适应性广、成本低、取材方便、结构简单、便于推广的收割、运输、脱粒新工具，会议决定将这些工具在全省范围内因地制宜地进行推广。
    目前，大制大改大修大推广夏收新工具的运动，在主要夏收地区已初步形成。据主要产麦区晋南闻喜、稷山、平陆、侯马等县市不完全统计，最近已改革推广各种夏收工具五十万多件。
    今年各地在准备夏收工具工作中，普遍采取了土洋结合的办法。一方面推广使用工效高、构造完善的较大机械，一方面注意改制简单易行小型工具。稷山县在改革推广较大型夏收工具的同时，大抓现在夏收工具的改进运用和增制小型新工具，使现有车子滚珠轴承化；将三千部旧扇车安装上轴承；并且制造一万部木制带轮推叉。河南
    本报郑州14日电　河南省各地采用“找、挖、修、制、改、拣、代、调”八项措施，大抓夏收工具制造改良工作，取得了显著成绩。信阳专区到4月底已改制夏收小件农具一千二百万件，占全部计划的72％；许昌专区到5月5日，改制的各种夏收农具已占计划的88％以上。其他各专区的改制计划，也都完成得很好。
    由于原料供不应求，交通运输繁忙，河南各地在准备夏收工具中，认真贯彻了依靠群众自力更生、就地取材、就地生产、就地供应的方针。各地发动群众采用了挖潜力，找丢失工具，修理损坏工具，拣废品堆，制代用品，调济余缺，制造改良等措施，充分准备各种麦收用具。
    商丘专区开展了一个以桑杈、筋杈、扫帚、镰刀、锄头为主的大修大补运动，近十天内就修补各种残损小件农具二百八十五万件。这个专区的商业部门从收购旧废铁堆中挑拣出残损不大的镰刀、锄头、铁锨、犁铧、镢头等小件农具十一万五千多件，经过修补加钢后，仍旧可以供给农民使用。
    为了解决部分农具供不应求的困难，各地都设法做了许多代用品来弥补。淮阳县利用桑条、枣条、木杆做成桑杈六千多把，用榆条、桑条、柳条做成扫帚一万七千把。巩县、密县找出柴扫帚二千二百多把代替了竹扫帚。
    陕西
    新华社西安电　陕西省各地人民公社在夏收准备工作中，特别注意对镰刀、扫帚、杈把、磨刀石、布袋等小农具的检查和储备。目前，许多公社的供销部和商店都日夜办公，收购和出售各种夏收小农具。黄陵县宜君人民公社二千多个劳动力，平均每个劳动力都有一把镰刀，平均两个人一把扫帚和一把木杈，另外还有足够麦收使用的磨石、竹筐、扁担等。乾县、咸阳、长安等二十多个县、市的一百五十多个人民公社的夏收小农具经过检查，都已根据需要添置齐全。
    陕西省历年夏收作物的收割碾藏，主要依靠小农具。去年和今年各地虽然推广了一些新式的收割工具，但是，其数量少，而多数又都在试用阶段。因此，全省二千多万亩小麦绝大部分仍靠镰割，麦场上主要使用木杈、扫帚等工具。各人民公社针对这一情况，十分注意对小农具的检查和准备。通过算细账，根据夏收作物多少，全半劳力多少，制定出添置小农具的计划，并发动群众千方百计挖掘小农具的货源。临潼县新丰人民公社席家生产队早在一个月前通过摸底算账，计算出今年夏收工作量比去年增加一倍，而最需要的各种小农具即缺四百多件，已有的一些小农具也有损坏，需要修理。通过摸底算账，纠正了一些人存在的“小农具没啥要紧，到时候再凑”的错误认识，全队社员人人动手修理小农具，经过二十多天努力，全队夏收需要的镰刀、口袋、防雨草帘、小推车和木杈等都准备得一应俱全，对这些小农具还确定专人负责保管。全国农业劳动模范王保京所领导的烽火人民公社集中了能工巧匠几十人，建立了小型农具修配厂二十个，四天多就修补小农具一万四千多件，并对全社二十三个生产小队逐队进行了检查和验收，使小农具的储备完全落实。
    全省各地商业部门也都积极组织货源，供应夏收小农具。据不完全地统计，商业部门已供应各地夏收小农具达二千多万件。西安市民用器材商店农业生产批发部职工，展开了以组织供应夏收小农具的红旗竞赛，这个批发部对郊区各人民公社所需小农具很早就进行了调查，根据需要已和五十多个工厂、学校实习工厂和生产服务社签订了产销合同。现在已将生产的二十四万多张镰刀、四万多把镰把以及大量的车辆挽具、口袋等运到郊区各商店。
    北京
    本报讯　北京市郊区许多人民公社在加强麦田后期管理的同时，正积极修制农业机械和工具，安排劳力，迎接夏收。
    通州区各公社都抽调负责干部具体领导麦收准备工作。他们除了发动群众大搞工具改革和设法充分发挥现有动力机械的效能以外，并且合理地安排农活，在麦收前作好粮田耪三遍和棉田治虫等工作，以便在麦收时集中力量抢收。
    北京市有关部门已经为麦收准备了一些联合收割机、马拉收割机和小麦脱粒机。许多公社也都设法组织农具修造厂一方面检修各种收割机械和农具，一方面制造经过改良的简易收割机和新式镰刀。大兴区红星人民公社把麦收用的四台联合收割机和一台脱粒机修好，正在编制夏收时机具行动的路线。顺义区李桥公社已经制成了每天能收三十亩左右的手推和马拉的收割机。通州区各人民公社的铁、木工厂正在集中力量、突击生产镰刀、沙耙等麦收工具。（附图片）
