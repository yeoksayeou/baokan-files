Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 10th:

    The "Indian Express" published a commentary on the 9th, stating: "India is eager to quickly resolve its disputes with Pakistan, but this does not require sacrificing relations with other friendly neighbors. Moreover, New Delhi will by no means abandon its consistent and unwavering policy of non-alignment."

    The commentary, titled "Abused Aid," said: "U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy frankly admitted during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Pakistan 'maintains a force exceeding what the U.S. Department of Defense chiefs of staff deem necessary for anti-communism.' When he hurriedly explained that the U.S. weapons given to Pakistan were for defense against communism, Senator Fulbright correctly retorted that Pakistan's only use for those weapons was to shoot down an Indian plane."

    The newspaper mentioned that the U.S. Defense Secretary had told the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee that the Tibetan rebellion had led Indian leaders to consider finding ways to resolve difficulties with Pakistan. The newspaper pointed out that, unfortunately, informed people like the U.S. Defense Secretary showed that he did not understand India's foreign policy. He should understand that India's foreign policy aims to promote friendly neighborly relations with Pakistan, just as it does with the People's Republic of China. Only those who consider communism a terrible concept would say that Indian leaders are considering reconciliation with Pakistan because of the Tibetan crisis. The truth of the matter is that U.S. military aid is responsible for Pakistan's continued and even strengthened uncompromising attitude towards India. Since Pakistan strengthened its military power with U.S. weapons, it has been openly displaying violence towards India that it had not shown for a long time.

    The newspaper concluded, "The time has come for the U.S. authorities to realize that continuing to provide military aid to Pakistan is foolish if they are serious and sincere about promoting Indo-Pakistani friendship."

    “印度快报”不满美国援助巴基斯坦威胁印度
    主张印度坚持不结盟政策
    新华社新德里10日电　“印度快报”在9日发表评论说：“印度急于迅速解决它同巴基斯坦的争端，但是这并不需要牺牲同其他友好邻国的关系。而且新德里无论如何决不放弃它一贯的坚定不移的不结盟政策”。
    这篇以“被滥用的援助”为题的评论说：“美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在参议院外交委员会作证时坦白地承认，巴基斯坦‘所保持的力量超过了美国国防部参谋长们认为是反共所必需的数量’。当他赶忙解释美国给巴基斯坦的武器是用于防御共产主义时，参议员富布赖特正确地反驳说，巴基斯坦对那些武器的唯一用途是打下一架印度飞机”。
    这家报纸提到，美国国防部长曾告诉美国外交委员会说，西藏叛乱使印度领袖们考虑设法解决同巴基斯坦的困难。这家报纸指出，不幸的是，像美国国防部长这样了解情况的人竟表现出他不了解印度的外交政策，他应当了解，印度外交政策旨在同巴基斯坦就像同中华人民共和国一样，促进友好的睦邻的关系。只有那些认为共产主义是可怕的观念的人们，才会说印度领袖们由于西藏危机而考虑同巴基斯坦和解。问题的真相是，巴基斯坦之所以继续甚至加强对印度的不妥协态度，应由美国军事援助负责。巴基斯坦自从由于美国武器加强了它的军事力量以来，正在公开地向印度显示它长期来没有显露的暴力。
    这家报纸最后说，“时机成熟了，美国当局应认识到，如果他们对促进印巴友好是认真的和有诚意的话，继续给予巴基斯坦军事援助是愚蠢的。”
