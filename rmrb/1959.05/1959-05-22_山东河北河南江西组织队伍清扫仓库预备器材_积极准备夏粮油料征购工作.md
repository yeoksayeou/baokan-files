    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: Party and government leading departments in Shandong Province are conducting preparations for summer grain procurement.
    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a wheat distribution and procurement meeting in early May. After the meeting, local committees successively convened meetings of county party secretaries, cooperative ministers, finance and trade ministers, and grain bureau chiefs. Linqi, Zibo and other regions also convened meetings of the first secretaries of commune party committees, rapidly implementing the central and provincial committee's instructions on summer grain procurement. The provincial committee and local committees are all led by the first or deputy secretaries to deploy the summer grain procurement work.
    Currently, the procurement tasks for the entire province have been universally distributed to counties. Tancheng and other counties in the Linqi area, where wheat matures earlier, have been deployed to communes and production teams. The Tancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has made reasonable arrangements for seeds, rations, and feed for the entire county. At the same time, it requires relevant departments to ensure rapid collection and transportation during the summer grain acquisition process, completing the warehousing tasks quickly. Currently, the state and commune granary keepers in the county are carrying out preparations before the grain is put into storage; cadres for each acquisition point have also been fully deployed.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st: Since the beginning of May, agricultural and grain departments in various special districts and counties of Hebei Province have drawn more than 1,000 cadres to form many work teams, which have gone to wheat-producing areas to prepare for wheat procurement. The grain bureaus of each county have organized a group of cadres to go to communes and production teams to conduct typical trials. They will adopt the method of joint evaluation between communes and teams to verify yields during the wheat harvest, preparing for this year's wheat procurement work.
    Grain departments in various regions have also cleared existing grain stocks in state granaries, and used medicinal powder to spray and disinfect the vacated granaries and prepared storage equipment. The grain warehouses vacated in Handan Prefecture and Tianjin's counties have all been made "six-sided smooth." Grain departments in various regions have also actively helped people's communes build granaries, and imparted experience in wheat storage. Handan Prefecture has prepared more than 160,000 rooms for storing the commune's rations and seeds. Cadres from the grain departments of Ci County, Quzhou and other counties have gone deep into the communes to teach members of the production teams various advanced experiences in wheat storage, which are very popular among the members.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st: Various parts of Henan Province are stepping up various preparations to welcome the summer's new grain to the market and into storage.
    At present, warehouses for storing the grain purchased in the summer have been prepared. The volume of warehouses vacated by grain departments in various regions exceeds the needs of summer grain storage, and most of the warehouses have been disinfected. Bank departments have prepared funds for purchasing summer grain, and commercial departments are transferring agricultural production materials and summer commodities to supply the countryside.
    As early as April, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting to allocate this year's summer grain and oil procurement tasks to various regions, and issued instructions requiring various regions to draw cadres to strengthen financial and trade institutions at all levels, and fully prepare for summer grain procurement. Recently, the Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial summer grain procurement meeting, requiring various regions to combine summer harvesting and summer planting, educate the masses to enthusiastically pay public grain and sell surplus grain to the state, and complete the procurement plan in accordance with quality and quantity. Furthermore, in the spirit of "looking ahead and behind, using abundance to compensate for deficiencies," vigorously advocate planned grain use and prevent grain waste.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 21st: Jiangxi Province has begun procuring this year's oil, and currently 4.5 million jin of rapeseed oil and rapeseed have been put into storage.
    The oil procurement work in Jinxian and Gaoan counties is progressing relatively quickly. Jinxian County has completed 93% of its acquisition task, and Gaoan County has completed 40%. The Meizhuang and Sanli People's Communes in Jinxian County have adopted the method of dividing and contracting acquisitions, pressing oil or loading it directly onto trucks and ships on the spot. They also mobilized the masses to transport oil into storage during the gaps after transplanting rice seedlings. It only took three days to overfulfill the task of delivering spring oil.
    At present, oil-producing areas throughout the province generally adopt methods such as on-the-spot acquisition, on-the-spot oil pressing, simultaneous collection of oilseeds and oil, and returning oilcakes when collecting materials. The effect is good.

    山东河北河南江西组织队伍清扫仓库预备器材
    积极准备夏粮油料征购工作
    新华社济南21日电　山东省各地党政领导部门正在进行夏粮征购的准备工作。
    中共山东省委在5月上旬召开了小麦分配征购会议。会后，各地委相继召开了县委书记、合作部长、财贸部长和粮食局长会议，临沂、淄博等地区还召开了公社党委第一书记会议，把中央和省委对夏粮征购工作的指示迅速贯彻下去。省委和各地委都由第一书记或副书记挂帅，部署夏粮征购工作。
    现在，全省的征购任务已经普遍布置到县，小麦成熟较早的临沂专区郯城等县，已布置到公社和生产队。中共郯城县委对全县的种籽、口粮、饲料都已作合理安排，同时要求有关部门在夏粮收购工作中做到快收、快运，迅速完成入仓任务。现在，这个县的国家和公社粮仓保管人员，正在进行粮食入库前的准备工作；各个收购点的干部也已调配齐全。
    据新华社天津21日电　河北省各专区、县的农业、粮食等部门，从5月初开始，就抽调了一千多名干部组成许多工作组，到各产麦区进行小麦征购的准备工作。各县粮食局都组织一批干部到公社、生产队作典型试办。他们将在小麦收割时采取社与社、队与队联合评议的方法，核实产量。为今年的小麦征购工作做好准备。
  各地粮食部门还清理了现有国家粮仓的存粮，对腾出的粮仓和备妥的保管器材，用药粉喷撒消毒。邯郸专区和天津市各县腾出的粮食仓库都作到了六面光。各地粮食部门还积极帮助人民公社建立粮仓，传授保管小麦的经验。邯郸专区已准备好储存公社口粮、种籽的库房十六万多间。磁县、曲周等县粮食部门的干部深入到公社，向生产队的社员们讲授保管小麦的各种先进经验，深受社员们的欢迎。
    据新华社郑州21日电　河南省各地加紧进行各项准备工作，迎接夏季新粮上市、入库。
    目前，储存夏季征购粮食用的仓库已经准备好。各地粮食部门腾出的仓库容积，超过了夏粮入库的需要，绝大部分仓库房经过了消毒处理。银行部门已经准备了供收购夏粮用的资金，商业部门正在调运农业生产资料和夏令商品供应农村。
    早在4月份，中共河南省委便召开会议，把今年夏粮、油料征购任务分配到各地，并且发出指示，要求各地抽调干部充实各级财贸机构，充分作好夏粮征购的准备工作。最近，省人民委员会又召开了全省夏粮征购会议，要求各地结合夏收夏种，教育群众踊跃向国家缴纳公粮和出售余粮，按质按量地完成征购计划。并且要本着“瞻前顾后，以丰补歉”的精神，大力提倡有计划地用粮，防止浪费粮食。
    据新华社南昌21日电　江西省已开始征购今年的油料，目前已有四百五十万斤菜油和油菜籽入库。
    进贤、高安两县的油料征购工作进行的比较快，进贤县已完成收购任务的93％，高安县完成40％。进贤县的枚庄、三里人民公社，采取划片包干收购，就地榨油或者就地装车上船的办法，并且发动群众在插秧后的空隙时间运送油料入库，只用三天时间就超额完成了春油交售任务。
    目前，全省各产油区一般都采取就地收购，就地榨油，油籽兼收，收料退饼，随到随收等办法收购油料，效果良好。
