Comrade Representatives:

I fully endorse the reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

I lived abroad for more than thirty years, and my understanding of the motherland's situation is not very comprehensive, especially the changes in the motherland after liberation. In my memory, old China was a "sheet of loose sand," a country subjected to humiliation. For many years, I had been longing for my motherland to be able to get rid of its enslaved status and raise its head in the world. However, due to the corruption of the past government authorities, this wish was not realized before liberation. Decades have passed. On October 1, 1949—on this great day, the new motherland—the People's Republic of China—was born in the world. It brought new hope to more than 600 million people. Not long after the founding of the country, the Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the American-led imperialist aggressors in Korea. What exciting news! This unprecedentedly uplifting achievement invigorated overseas Chinese and awakened the patriotic hearts of every conscientious Chinese person. This was the first time in my life that I felt the honor of being Chinese and experienced the pride of being a member of the Chinese nation. These things made my desire to return to the motherland even more urgent, and I finally returned to the embrace of the motherland in 1957.

The Face of the Motherland Has Completely Changed

After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party took over the dilapidated mess left by old China. Could it change the past poverty and backwardness in just a few years? For me, who had been abroad for many years and could not personally witness the facts, I observed the changes in the motherland with some doubts in my mind when I first returned. In the past year or so, I have seen countless new things, many of which were beyond my expectations. These living facts dispelled the doubts in my mind. From these facts, I realized that the Chinese Communist Party is indeed a selfless party that serves the people wholeheartedly. That is why it has been able to completely change the face of the motherland in just a few years.

The Rural Landscape Has Taken on a New Look

In order to visit my hometown and relatives, whom I had been separated from for more than thirty years, I made a trip back to my hometown during the Mid-Autumn Festival of 1957. In my memory, the rural areas of North China in the past were in a desolate state of constant water and drought disasters, and extreme poverty. However, although Hebei Province suffered a flood disaster in 1956, in previous years, encountering such a year, farmers would inevitably suffer from hunger and cold, fleeing famine and wandering everywhere, and I don't know how many people would die. However, what I saw during my trip back to my hometown and after my return was completely different. Everyone had food and clothing, and their lives were very comfortable. Even the old earthen houses and dilapidated houses left over from the old society were hardly to be seen. New brick houses were built in every village. The characteristic of agricultural production in old China was decentralized management and individual small-scale farming. But what I saw in the countryside this time was the farmers who had been organized, working happily in groups on their own land. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they abolished exploitation and oppression, and established new relationships between people. They understand that only by organizing and using collective strength can they overcome natural disasters, achieve bumper harvests, and improve their living standards; only by taking the cooperative socialist road can they have enough food and clothing.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival of 1958, I returned to my hometown to visit relatives again. In just one year, there were even greater and newer changes in the countryside. Along the villages and towns passed by the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, thousands of small blast furnaces were erected. The folks, with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, worked day and night to smelt iron and steel, responding to the government's call to ensure that China's steel output in 1958 would reach or exceed 10.7 million tons. Traveling east from the railway line into the Great Plains, everywhere were tens of thousands of men, women, old and young, rushing to harvest and plow deeply with soaring energy. Their slogan was to not leave an inch of abandoned land, in order to ensure a bumper harvest of crops. China's total grain output in 1958 has exceeded 700 billion jin, and the food problem of our 650 million people has been fundamentally solved. This is a major event that has shocked the world. What interests me most is the people's communes established in the countryside, which combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. They have all set up nurseries, public canteens, and homes of happiness. The goal of eating and providing for the elderly without money will be fully realized throughout the country. This is a major event that the Chinese people have never dreamed of for thousands of years.

In the past year or so, I have also traveled to cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Changchun for official business. I have personally seen that all construction undertakings in the motherland are advancing by leaps and bounds. For example, in addition to producing large trucks, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in Changchun has also begun to manufacture a large number of "Dongfeng" brand sedans. A few years ago, the Nanjing Automobile Repair Plant was just a repair workshop. Now, it not only produces a large number of machine tools and agricultural implements, but also plans to produce a large number of automobiles. The Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory, in cooperation with the Nanjing Zijinshan Observatory, has produced a 60 cm astronomical reflector telescope. Recently, I visited the Beijing Glass Factory. The complete set of equipment is modern, and it is preparing to trial-produce high-quality optical glass. What I have seen above were all unimaginable and dare not imagine before, but under the correct leadership of the Party and the spirit of the masses daring to think and daring to act, great achievements have been made.

Scientific Undertakings Are Leaping Forward

What encourages me the most is the brilliant achievements and boundless prospects in the field of scientific undertakings. I am proudly experiencing the great leap forward in the motherland's scientific undertakings in 1958, and I am about to experience even greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward in the future. In the short second half of last year, the clarion call for a great march into science rang out in all parts of the motherland, and a variety of research institutions emerged everywhere. The scientific research institutions established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the western suburbs of Beijing alone have filled the entire Zhongguancun. Due to the rapid development of scientific undertakings, the existing space has been greatly insufficient. Therefore, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has decided to build a large research base in the northern suburbs of Beijing. The western and northern suburbs of Beijing will soon be connected to become a large-scale scientific research city in the world. In the past few years, many research departments have been in the process of laying a foundation, and in this short process, they have achieved many amazing achievements. For example, China's atomic reactor can produce dozens of radioactive isotopes; the Changchun Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics achieved very high quality in the several major precision optical instruments manufactured last year.

Full of Confidence in the Development of Astronomical Undertakings

I am an astronomical scientist and have unlimited confidence in the development of the motherland's astronomical undertakings. We know that the foundation of this science in our country is very weak, and some departments are even blank spots. In 1956, the government formulated a twelve-year development plan for astronomy, and is currently trying every means to complete it ahead of schedule.

The preparation for the construction of the modernized Beijing Astronomical Observatory is part of this long-term plan. Although the preparation work has only been for a year, and although many difficulties due to lack of experience have been encountered in the work, a lot of work has been done and great achievements have been made. The staff of the preparatory office was only seven people at the beginning of 1958, and it increased to 250 people at the beginning of 1959. Various research institutions have been established one after another. The site selection of the high-altitude astronomical observatory requires complex and strict conditions, and it will take a long time. It is expected that it can be decided ahead of schedule by the end of this year. The observation of solar surface activity has been going on for half a year, which is one of the observation bases for predicting solar surface activity within three years. Radio astronomy was originally one of the blank spots in China's scientific undertakings, but in the great leap forward of 1958, a short-wave parabolic radio telescope was successfully imitated, and solar observations are now being carried out normally. The main building of the time service station has been completed, and it is planned to put it into operation after completing all the basic construction in 1959.

In short, since I returned to China, I have not only felt very optimistic about the construction undertakings of the motherland, but also very satisfied with the work assigned to me. In the past year or so, I have deeply felt the warmth of the motherland's soil and the government's eager care and attention to returned scientists. It always tries every means to allow scientists to give full play to their expertise. I hope that the overseas Chinese representatives and members present here will convey to the Chinese scientists and students who are currently abroad after returning to their respective locations to return to participate in the construction of the motherland as soon as possible and work together to build a better and more beautiful new China!

Finally, let me express my heartfelt gratitude here to the people of the motherland for giving me the greatest honor and trust as a people's representative. Since I have not been back to China for a long time, some aspects of the motherland are not yet well understood, and some are not yet understood. I will study hard, work hard, and contribute my strength to the great construction cause of the motherland.

### 我深深感到祖国土地的温暖  程茂兰代表的发言

专栏：

    我深深感到祖国土地的温暖
    程茂兰代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    我在国外生活了三十多年，对祖国的情况了解并不太多，尤其是祖国解放后的变化情况了解的更少。在记忆里的旧中国是“一盘散沙”、受人凌辱的国家。多少年来，一直渴望着自己的祖国能够早日摆脱被奴役的地位并在世界上抬起头来。可是，由于过去的政府当局的腐败，这个愿望在解放前终未能实现。几十年的岁月过去了。一九四九年十月一日——在这个伟大的日子，新的祖国——中华人民共和国在世界诞生了。它给六亿多人民带来了新的希望。建国不久，中国人民志愿军便在朝鲜打败了以美国为首的帝国主义侵略军，这是多么令人兴奋的消息呀！这个百年来未有过的扬眉吐气的事迹，振奋了海外的侨胞，唤醒了每一个有良心的中国人的爱国心。这是我有生以来第一次感到做一个中国人的荣誉，体会到做中华民族一员的自豪感。这些，使我归回祖国的愿望更加迫切，终于在一九五七年回到了祖国的怀抱。
    祖国的面貌彻底改变了
    解放后，中国共产党接收了旧中国遗留下来的破烂摊子，是否能够在短短的几年内改变过去那样贫困落后的状态？对多年在国外又未能身临其境亲眼看到事实的我来说，在回到祖国的初期，就抱着一些怀疑的心情来观察祖国的变化。在这一年多的过程中，我看到了无数的新鲜事物，有好多竟是出乎我意料之外的。这些活生生的事实解除了我思想中的怀疑，从这些事实里使我了解到中国共产党确实是大公无私、全心全意为人民服务的政党，所以才能在短短的几年，彻底改变了祖国的面貌。
    农村的景象焕然一新
    为了探望久别三十多年的故乡和亲人，在一九五七年旧历中秋节，我特地作了一次回乡旅行。在我的记忆里，过去华北的农村，是常年处在水旱灾害、饥寒交迫的荒凉境况。但是，一九五六年河北省虽然遭受到一场洪水灾害，按往年来说，遇到这样的年头，农民免不了要挨饥受寒，到处逃荒流浪，不知要死亡多少人。这次在我回乡途中和返里后所看到的情况，却完全不是这样，而是人人有吃有穿，生活过的很舒畅，连旧社会遗留下来的土房破屋几乎已见不到了，各个村里一片片的新砖房也都建筑起来了。旧中国农业生产的特点是分散经营、小户单干。但是这次在乡间亲眼看到的是已经组织起来的农民，成群结队地在自己的土地上愉快地劳动，他们在中国共产党的领导下，废除了剥削和压迫，人与人之间建立了新的关系。他们懂得只有组织起来，以集体的力量，才能战胜自然灾害，获得丰收，提高自己的生活水平；只有走合作化的社会主义道路，才能丰衣足食。
    在一九五八年旧历中秋节，我又返乡探亲。仅仅一年的时间，乡村里又有更大更新的变化。沿京汉铁路北段所经过的村庄城镇，树立了成千成万的小高炉，老乡们以移山倒海的气概，昼夜不停地炼钢铁，响应政府的号召，以保证我国一九五八年的钢产量达到或超过一千零七十万吨的指标。从铁路线东行进入大平原地区，到处都是成千成万的男女老少以冲天的干劲抢收、深耕，他们的口号是不让一粒弃地，以保证农作物大丰收。我国一九五八年粮食的总产量已经超过了七千亿斤，我们六亿五千万人的粮食问题得到了根本的解决，这是震动世界的大事。最使我发生兴趣的是在农村建立起来的以工、农、商、学、兵相结合的人民公社，都举办了托儿所、公共食堂和幸福院，吃饭、养老不要钱的目标将在全国完全实现，这是我国人民千百年来梦想不到的大事。
    这一年多以来，我还曾因公赴南京、上海、长春等城市。亲眼看到祖国的各项建设事业都在突飞猛进。例如长春第一汽车制造厂，除了生产大卡车以外，也开始制造大量“东风”牌的小轿车。南京汽车修配厂几年前只不过是一个修配的车间，现在不但生产了大量的机床和农具，还计划生产大量的汽车，南京教学仪器厂与南京紫金山天文台协作制成了口径六十公分的天文返光望远镜。最近参观了北京玻璃厂，全套装备都是近代化的，正在筹备试制优质的光学玻璃。以上所看到的都是以前不可想像也不敢想像的，而在党的正确领导和群众敢想、敢干的精神下，都取得了很大的成就。
    科学事业正在大跃进
    对我鼓舞最大的是科学事业方面的光辉成就和无可限量的远景。我骄傲地经历着一九五八年的祖国科学事业的大跃进，正要经历今后更大、更好、更全面的跃进，去年短短的下半年，祖国各地都鸣出科学大进军的号角，到处涌现了多种多样的研究机构。仅中国科学院在北京西郊建立的科学研究机构，已经布满了整个中关村，由于科学事业的迅速发展，现有地方已经大大不敷分配。所以，中国科学院决定在北京北郊增建大面积的研究基地。北京西郊和北郊将很快地连接成为世界上规模宏大的科学研究城。几年来，许多研究部门是在打好基础的过程，就在这短短的过程中竟获得了许多惊人的成就，例如我国的原子堆已经能生产几十种放射性的同位素；长春光机研究所在去年制造的几件重大精密光学仪器，在质量上都取得很高的水平。
    对天文事业的发展充满信心
    我是天文科学工作者，对祖国天文事业的发展怀着无限的信心。我们知道，这门科学在我国基础是非常薄弱的，甚至有的部门还是空白点。一九五六年，政府制定了天文学十二年发展远景计划，目前正在千方百计的提前完成。
    现代化的北京天文台的筹建，就是这个远景计划的一部分，筹建工作虽只有一年，在工作中虽然也遇到了不少缺乏经验的困难，但作了不少的工作，取得了很大的成绩。筹备处的人员，一九五八年初才七人，一九五九年初就增加到二百五十人。各个研究机构已陆续建立起来。高山天体物台的选址，因为要求条件复杂严格，需时较长，预计可以在今年年底提前决定下来。太阳表面活动的观测工作已经开始进行了半年，这是为三年内预报太阳表面活动的观测基点之一。射电天文学原是我国科学事业中空白点之一，但在一九五八年大跃进中，已仿制成功了短波抛物面射电望远镜，现在正常的进行太阳观测。授时台的主楼建设已完成，拟于一九五九年完成全部基本建设后投入工作。
    总之，自我回国后，不但对祖国建设事业感到非常的乐观，对分配我的工作也很满意。一年多以来，我深深地感到祖国土地的温暖，政府对回国科学家热切的关怀和照顾。总是想尽一切办法来让科学家尽情的发挥自己的特长，我希望在座的华侨代表和委员们回到各所在地后，转告现在国外的我国科学家和留学生，早日回来参加祖国的建设，共同为建设更好、更美的新中国而努力！
    最后，让我在这里对祖国人民给我当任人民代表的最大的荣誉和信任表示衷心的感谢，由于我回国的时间不久，对祖国的各方面，有的还了解不够，有的还不了解。我要努力学习，努力工作，把自己的力量很好地贡献给祖国伟大的建设事业。
