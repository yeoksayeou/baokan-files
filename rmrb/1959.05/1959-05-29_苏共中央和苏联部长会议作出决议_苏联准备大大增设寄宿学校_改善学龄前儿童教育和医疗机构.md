Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th dispatch (TASS): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR recently issued a resolution on measures to develop boarding schools during the period of 1959-1965. The resolution pointed out that by 1965, the number of students in boarding schools nationwide must be increased to 2.5 million, which is 13 times more than the current number.

The resolution pointed out that boarding schools have been widely welcomed by the working people in a short period of time, and practice has proven that they are the most successful form of educating children under the conditions of building a communist society.

The resolution said that in the future, the number of boarding schools will be greatly increased so that in the future, all parents can send their children to boarding schools.

The resolution said that the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers approved the initiative put forward by advanced collective farms to build boarding schools at their own expense, and decided to strongly support and promote this initiative, providing collective farms with the necessary assistance in building boarding schools.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th dispatch (TASS, 27th): The Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union recently passed a resolution "On Further Developing Preschool Children's Institutions and Improving Preschool Children's Education and Medical Facilities."

The resolution pointed out that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in correctly educating preschool children. At present, more than 3.4 million children are educated in nurseries and kindergartens. In 1958, the state allocated 10 billion rubles to preschool children's institutions, about twice as much as in 1953.

The resolution said that in the current seven-year plan, the state will allocate more than 103 billion rubles to the educational funding of the preschool children's institution system; in 1965, the number of places in preschool children's institutions will double.

In order to have a unified system of education for preschool children, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR decided to consider local conditions and possibilities and combine the two types of children's institutions—nurseries and kindergartens—into a unified preschool children's institution. The combined institutions, except for those belonging to certain relevant departments, are all under the centralized leadership of the Ministries of Education of the various Union Republics.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers also suggested doing everything possible to encourage the establishment of regular and seasonal preschool children's institutions funded by collective farms, and to help collective farms obtain building materials for this project.

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议作出决议
    苏联准备大大增设寄宿学校
    改善学龄前儿童教育和医疗机构
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议最近发表了关于1959—1965年期间发展寄宿学校措施的决议。决议中指出，到1965年必须使全国寄宿学校的学生人数增加到二百五十万人，这就是说将比目前多十三倍。
    决议指出，寄宿学校在短短的时期内受到了劳动人民的普遍欢迎，实践证明，它是在建设共产主义社会条件下教育儿童的最成功的形式。
    决议说，今后，寄宿学校的数目将大大增加，以便在将来让所有家长都能把自己的子弟送到寄宿学校学习。
    决议说，苏共中央和部长会议赞同先进集体农庄提出的自费建筑寄宿学校的倡议，并决定大力支持和推广这一倡议，在建筑寄宿学校方面给予集体农庄以必要的帮助。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议最近通过了一项“关于进一步发展学龄前儿童机构，改善学龄前儿童的教育和医疗设施”的决议。
    决议指出，苏联在正确地教育学龄前儿童方面已取得了巨大的成就。目前，在托儿所和幼儿园受教育的儿童有三百四十万以上。1958年国家拨给学龄前儿童机构的款项曾达一百亿卢布，比1953年约多一倍。
    决议说，在目前的七年计划中，国家拨给学龄前儿童机构系统的教育经费将达一千零三十亿卢布以上；1965年学龄前儿童机构的名额将增加一倍。
    为了使学龄前儿童的教育有一个统一的系统，苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定，考虑地方的条件和可能性，把两种类型的儿童机构——托儿所和幼儿园——联合成为一个统一的学龄前儿童机构。联合后的机构，除属于某些有关部门的以外，都由各加盟共和国教育部集中领导。
    苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议还建议尽一切可能鼓励建立由集体农庄负担经费的经常性的和季节性的学龄前儿童机构，并帮助集体农庄获得用于此项目的的建筑材料。（附图片）
