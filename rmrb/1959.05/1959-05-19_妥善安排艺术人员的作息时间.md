    Properly Arrange the Working Hours of Art Workers
    At the Second National People's Congress and the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultive Conference, many famous actors delivered speeches. They talked about a common and important issue in current artistic work, which is the urgent need to improve artistic quality. This is the unanimous demand of the Party and the people on artists.
    Improving artistic quality is not easy and requires long-term and arduous efforts in many aspects. On May 12, the Shanghai Wenhui Daily published a news item about Shanghai theater groups comprehensively arranging working hours. Appropriately arranging working hours is an important matter in the theater world at present and a necessary measure to create favorable conditions for improving artistic quality. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year, many art workers were full of political enthusiasm and worked hard to perform for workers, farmers, and soldiers, even sacrificing some rest and sleep time. This spirit is commendable. However, from the long-term interests of the development of our entire art cause, the leaders of each performing group should always care about the daily work, study, and rest of the art workers in their unit and make comprehensive and reasonable arrangements, making different regulations according to the different circumstances of various types of art workers.
    I once heard a middle-aged actor with nearly twenty years of experience anxiously talk about her urgent need for sufficient time to engage in artistic creation activities. Because she now has to go to and from work on time every day, is busy attending general meetings, and her professional studies are only the same as those of young actors, such as practicing basic skills, etc., plus she has some necessary social activities; in this way, she hardly has any time to ponder the role she is about to perform, let alone continue to improve the roles she has played in the past. She said, "There's no way not to lose one performance after another. If this goes on, who will want to watch my plays?" This anxious mood is understandable, and her reasonable request should be met. If an actor does not spend most of her time on artistic creation activities, it is difficult to continuously improve her artistic level. In the long run, how can she continue to be a favorite actor in the eyes of the audience? How can the overall performance level of the group be continuously improved? This is indeed something that leaders of each performance unit should think deeply about.
    Therefore, the measure of comprehensively arranging working hours for Shanghai theater groups is not just a matter of working methods, but an important key to continuously improving artistic quality and realizing the greater prosperity and development of the socialist literature and art cause. As an art lover, I hope that the leaders of every performance group in the country will not only make a reasonable and proper arrangement for the daily work, study, and rest time of the art workers in their unit as soon as possible; at the same time, they should also make a longer-term and comprehensive arrangement on how they can better go deep into life to absorb artistic nourishment, continuously improve their ideological level and professional skills, and continue to better meet the cultural needs of the broad masses of the people.

### 妥善安排艺术人员的作息时间

    妥善安排艺术人员的作息时间
    在第二届全国人民代表大会和中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会上，许多著名演员作了发言。他们谈到了当前艺术工作中一个共同的重要问题，那就是迫切需要提高艺术质量。这是党和人民对艺术家的一致要求。
    提高艺术质量不是容易的事，需要经过多方面的长期的艰巨努力。5月12日上海文汇报刊登了一则关于上海戏剧团体全面安排作息时间的新闻。适当地安排作息时间，是目前戏剧界的一件重要事情，是为提高艺术质量创造有利条件的必要的措施。许多艺术人员在去年大跃进的形势下，充满政治热情，鼓足干劲，为工人、农民和战士演出，甚至牺牲了一些休息和睡眠的时间，这种精神是可贵的。但是，从我们整个艺术事业发展前途的长远利益来看，每个演出团体的领导人应该随时随地关心本单位艺术人员日常的工作、学习和休息，并作出全面、合理的安排，要根据各类艺术人员的不同情况作出不同的规定。
    我曾经听到一位有着近二十年艺龄的中年演员，焦急地谈到她迫切需要足够的时间进行艺术创造活动。因为她现在每天必须按时上班、下班，忙于参加一般性的会议，业务学习又只是和青年演员一样的练功等等，加上她还有一些必要的社会活动；这样，她几乎多揣摩一下自己就要上演的角色的时间也没有，更不用说把过去扮演的角色继续加工了。她说：“没法子不演一个丢一个，日子久了，还有谁要看我的戏呢？”这种焦虑的心情是可以理解的，她的合理要求也是应该得到满足的。如果一个演员，她的大部分时间不是用来进行艺术创造活动，是很难不断提高艺术水平的。长久下去，她又怎么能够继续成为观众心目中喜爱的演员呢？整个团体的演出水平又怎么能够得到不断的提高呢？这的确是值得每个演出单位领导同志深思的。
    因此，上海戏剧团体全面安排作息时间的措施，就不仅仅是一个工作方法的问题，而是目前为了不断提高艺术质量，实现社会主义文学艺术事业更大繁荣发展这一政治任务的重要关键了。作为一个文艺爱好者，我希望全国每一个演出团体的领导同志，不仅要对本单位艺术人员日常的工作、学习和休息时间，尽快地作一个合理的妥善安排；同时，要对他们如何更好地深入生活吸取艺术养料，不断提高思想水平和业务技能，和继续更好地满足广大人民群众文化生活的需要，作一个较长远的全面安排。
