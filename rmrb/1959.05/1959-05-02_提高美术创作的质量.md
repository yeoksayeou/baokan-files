Joint speech by Committee Members Wang Ge Yizhi, Wang Chaowen, Feng Zikai, Ye Qianyu, Zhang Jingyou, Fu Baoshi, and Jiang Zhaohe

Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members:

We listened to the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan with great excitement. We are thrilled by the glorious achievements of socialist construction, and we face the new plan with full confidence. We firmly uphold the solemn stance of not allowing foreign interference in China's internal affairs and resolutely support all measures taken by the government to quell the rebellion in Tibet.

In his government work report, Premier Zhou Enlai affirmed the achievements of literature, art, and other cultural and educational undertakings, and also encouraged us to strive for great achievements so that we may enter an era of prosperity in cultural undertakings as soon as possible. We will respond to this call with courageous and vigorous work. We believe that in order to improve the quality of art creation and to create works with higher ideological and artistic value, we must not only maintain the revolutionary drive since the Great Leap Forward, but also study diligently, continue to integrate with the masses for a long time, improve our communist consciousness, master our professions, and strengthen our ability to understand and reflect life.

How to reflect the achievements, emotions, and aspirations of the working people in the great revolutionary practice, and at the same time, use this reflection to influence the people's spirit—Chinese artists have not only made considerable achievements, but also accumulated considerable experience. Not to mention comic strips, New Year pictures, prints, cartoons, propaganda posters, and arts and crafts, which have long been in universal and close contact with the people, but also traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, sculptures, stage art, and architectural art have made significant progress with the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. We are particularly excited that the development of mass art activities is magnificent and full of vitality. Under the brilliant guidance of the general line, the people have liberated their minds, dared to think and paint, and many talents with artistic creation abilities have emerged. The creation of the masses has had a major impact on the creation of professional artists. As far as Chinese painting is concerned, its achievements are also encouraging. Chinese painting used to be despised and even attacked, saying that it was backward, primitive, unscientific, had weak expressive power, and could not reflect reality. Under the correct leadership of the Party, Chinese painting has not stopped moving forward but has developed. Especially in 1958, many good works appeared that could not only truly reflect life, but also display the characteristics of Chinese painting in different forms and styles.

At the same time, we must also see the shortcomings and difficulties in our art work. For example, in our creations, how to reflect our great era in a generalizing, lively and vivid way, how to embody themes with great significance in novel, beautiful and poetic images, and to unify the originality of form with the requirements of truly reflecting life… these are not necessarily problems that most artists have already solved satisfactorily.

With the development of the great socialist construction, and with the Great Leap Forward of the national economy, the tasks before us are even more important. However, many jobs are still unfamiliar to us and we lack experience. Whether in cities or in the countryside, many public buildings and residential areas are being built or will be built. Can artists be fully competent and happy in these tasks related to beautifying the motherland? For example, how to make public buildings and commemorative sculptures that are enjoyed for a long time more expressive, more beautiful, and more enduring; or, how to make a part of the building, murals and sculptures belonging to the building, and garden design, not only practical, beautiful, and full of the spirit of the times, but also full of decorative effect, not only in line with the special laws of architectural art, but also creative, is not an easy task.

We know that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and the free competition of different forms and styles not only concentrates on reflecting the complexity of reality, the diversity of artists' specialties and interests, but also reflects the diversity of people's needs. People need not only fighting encouragement, but also rest and entertainment that are conducive to fighting. Just as there are theaters and movies, there is also a need for circuses and magic shows, just as there are historical paintings, there is also a need for flower-and-bird paintings and landscape paintings, people also need arts and crafts that can cultivate noble aesthetic tastes and are closely related to daily life. With the development of economic construction and cultural revolution, people's demands for arts and crafts are becoming more and more common and more and more strict. Our work in this area, like other art work, is still lagging behind objective needs.

If our art creation cannot fully adapt to the people's growing demands, what is the reason? We believe that the main reason is that our study is not enough. In order to move forward, we can only follow the Party's instructions, study seriously, study Marxism-Leninism, continue to go deep into life, transform our thinking, cultivate noble emotions, the ability to observe life, and at the same time, master our professions and enrich our professional knowledge.

Generally speaking, our political cultivation is still very insufficient, and our professional knowledge is also very insufficient. Some artists try to use flower-and-bird paintings to directly reflect the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, try to use commemorative sculptures to record life phenomena, and try to use arts and crafts to directly describe reality. The subjective desire is good, but the effect is a big problem. We have fought against formalism that is divorced from life, and we will never give up this struggle in the future. However, we must seriously study our profession and improve our professional level in order to adapt to the glorious but also arduous tasks. It is inconceivable that only empty enthusiasm and lack of reliable skills can successfully complete the task. If we do not study the various forms of plastic arts, and do not learn from successful artists at home and abroad, his work may inevitably run counter to the requirements of the people; not to mention constantly playing a powerful role in promoting mass amateur art activities.

In order to improve the quality of art, the art heritage of the motherland is one of the learning objects that cannot be ignored. The artistic wealth of the motherland is extremely rich and also very excellent. The formation of national art and folk art traditions is closely related to the needs of the people. Talking about improvement without leaving the traditions of national art and folk art is destined to be separated from the masses. Traditional painting, sculpture, architecture, and arts and crafts have many valuable knowledge worth learning. Even the important issues related to creation methods, such as the relationship between art and life, and the relationship between art and politics, also have many valuable experiences worth learning from. In order to improve the quality of art creation, in order to master the profession, and in order to fully grasp the knowledge of regularity, while learning from successful modern artists at home and abroad, we must seriously learn from the heritage. There are essences and dregs in the heritage, so it is said that inheriting the heritage is a kind of struggle. However, the attitude of despising the heritage must be opposed, and the attitude of "dabbling in" the heritage cannot be approved. We hope to work with artists across the country to seriously study the tradition of national and folk art, and make more efforts to create art works that are loved by the people and are both new and beautiful.

### 提高美术创作的质量

专栏：

    提高美术创作的质量
    王个簃、王朝闻、丰子恺、叶浅予、张景祐、
    傅抱石、蒋兆和委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们怀着非常振奋的心情，听了周恩来总理，李富春副总理，李先念副总理，彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的报告。我们为社会主义建设的光辉成就而感到欢欣鼓舞，我们满怀信心地面对着新的计划。我们坚持不容许外人干涉中国内政的严正态度，坚决拥护政府平定西藏叛乱的一切措施。
    周恩来总理在政府工作报告中肯定了文学艺术和其它文教事业的成就，同时也鼓励我们为了早日进入文化事业繁荣昌盛的时代，获得伟大的成绩而努力。我们要以勇猛精进的工作，来响应这一号召。我们感到，为了提高美术创作的质量，为了创造出思想性和艺术性都更高的作品，不只要继续保持大跃进以来的革命干劲，同时也要刻苦学习，继续长期地和群众结合，提高共产主义觉悟，精通业务，加强认识生活和反映生活的本领。
    怎样反映劳动人民在伟大的革命实践中的功绩、感情和愿望，同时又以这种反映来影响人民的精神，我国美术家不只有了不可轻视的成绩，而且积累了相当丰富的经验。早就和人民发生了普遍的密切的联系的连环画、年画、版画、漫画，宣传画和工艺美术且不说，中国画、油画、雕塑、舞台美术和建筑美术，随着社会主义建设的大跃进，都得到了不容忽视的进展。我们特别感到兴奋的是群众美术活动的开展波澜壮阔，气象万千，人民群众在总路线的光辉照耀下，解放思想，敢想敢画，涌现出了许多有美术创作才能的人才，群众的创作对专业美术家的创作产生了重大的影响。就中国画而论，其成就也是令人欢欣鼓舞的。中国画过去曾经受到轻视以至攻击，说它落后，原始，不科学，表现力弱，不能反映现实。在党的正确领导下，中国画没有停止前进而是向前发展了。特别是在一九五八年，出现了许多既能真实反映生活，又是发挥了中国画特长的形式不同、风格多样的好作品。
    与此同时，我们也不能不看到美术工作中的缺点与困难。比如说，在我们的创作里，怎样富于概括性地、生动活泼地反映我们伟大的时代生活，怎样使具有重大意义的主题，体现在新颖的、优美而又富于诗意的形象之中，把形式的独创性和真实反映生活的要求统一起来……都不见得是大多数美术家都已经圆满解决了的问题。
    随着伟大的社会主义建设的发展，随着国民经济的大跃进，摆在我们面前的任务就更重大了。可是有好些工作，对我们说来，还是生疏的，缺乏经验的。不论是在城市还是在农村，很多公共建筑和居民点正在建造或将要建造，在这些有关美化祖国的工作任务之前，美术家能不能完全胜任愉快呢？比如说，怎样使长期供人欣赏的公共建筑和纪念碑雕刻，建造得或制作得更有表现力，更美，更耐看；或者说，怎样使建筑的一部分，从属于建筑的壁画和雕刻，庭园设计，成为既实用，又美观，既富于时代精神又富于装饰作用，既符合建筑艺术的特殊规律又是富于创造性的，不是轻而易举的工作。
    我们知道“百花齐放”的方针，不同形式不同风格的自由竞赛，不只集中地反映了现实的复杂性，艺术家特长和兴趣的多样性，同时也反映了人民需要的多样性。人民既需要战斗的鼓舞，也需要有利于战斗的休息和娱乐。正如有了戏剧、电影还需要有马戏和魔术那样，正如有了历史画还需要花鸟画和山水画一样，人民也需要能够培养高尚的审美趣味和日常生活最密切的工艺美术。随着经济建设和文化革命的发展，人民对于工艺美术的要求愈来愈普遍，也愈来愈严格了。我们这方面的工作也和其它美术工作一样，还落后于客观需要。
    如果说我们的美术创作还不能完全适应人民日益增长的要求，那么，原因在那里呢？我们以为原因主要在于我们的学习不够。为了前进，只有按照党的指示，认真学习；学习马克思列宁主义，继续深入生活，改造思想，培养高尚的感情，观察生活的能力，同时要精通业务，丰富我们的业务知识。
    一般地说，我们的政治修养还很不够，业务知识也很不够。有些美术家企图用花鸟画来直接反映社会主义建设的大跃进，企图用纪念碑雕刻来记录生活现象，企图用工艺美术来直接描写现实，主观愿望是好的，效果就大成问题了。我们曾经和脱离生活的形式主义作过斗争，今后也决不放弃这种斗争。可是，我们必须认真研究我们的业务，提高我们的业务水平，以期和光荣的但也是艰巨的任务相适应。不能设想，只有空泛的热情而缺乏可靠的本领，也能够胜利完成任务。如果不研究造型艺术的各种形式，不向中外古今有成就的艺术家学习，也许他的工作难免要和人民的要求背道而驰；更谈不到不断对于群众业余艺术活动发挥有力的推动作用。
    为了提高艺术质量，祖国艺术遗产是不可忽视的学习对象之一。祖国的艺术财富无比丰富，也是非常优秀的。民族艺术，民间艺术传统的形成，和人民的需要有密切的联系。脱离民族艺术和民间艺术传统而谈提高，注定是要脱离群众的。传统的绘画、雕塑、建筑、工艺美术，有很多宝贵的知识值得我们学习，就是艺术与生活的关系，艺术与政治的关系等有关创作方法的重大问题，也有许多值得我们借鉴的宝贵经验。为了提高艺术创作的质量，为了精通业务，为了充分掌握规律性的知识，在向现代中外有成就的艺术家学习的同时，必须认真向遗产学习。遗产中有精华也有糟粕，所以说继承遗产是一种斗争。可是轻视遗产的态度必须反对，对遗产采取“浅尝辄止”的态度也不能赞成。我们希望和全国美术家一起，认真研究民族民间艺术的传统，为创造人民喜闻乐见、又新又美的美术作品而加倍努力。
