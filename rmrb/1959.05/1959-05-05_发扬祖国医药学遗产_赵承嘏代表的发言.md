To the Chairman and fellow delegates:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's political report and the work reports of Chief Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Peng Zhen. I would now like to offer some suggestions regarding the future development trends of traditional Chinese medicine.

Following the rectification campaign and under the leadership of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese medicine work has taken on an unprecedented new look. A mass movement of traditional Chinese medicine has been universally launched, better leveraging the service of traditional Chinese medicine for production, integrating Chinese and Western medicine, creating new Chinese medicine, and carrying forward the valuable experience of Chinese medicine accumulated over thousands of years. In terms of clinical research in traditional Chinese medicine, great achievements have been made. For example, traditional Chinese medicine has achieved definite efficacy in treating hypertension, nephritis, cirrhosis, infectious hepatitis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, scleroderma, willow branch bone setting, and more. Shanghai Eleventh People's Hospital and Huadong Hospital have achieved a cure rate of over 95% using acupuncture to treat acute appendicitis. Acupuncture is also highly effective for other diseases such as aplastic anemia, thromboangiitis obliterans, whooping cough, silicosis, asthma, duodenal ulcers, gastoptosis, cervicitis, promoting lactation and inducing labor, dysmenorrhea, and deafness. The Soviet Union also values China's medical traditions and has established special institutions to conduct scientific research on acupuncture and other therapies. In terms of Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine, a surge has begun in various medical and health institutions in China, and certain achievements have been made. Taking Anhui Province as an example, health departments at all levels have earnestly implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. Over the past few years, the province has absorbed 1,649 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners into national health institutions. Sixteen city hospitals and sixty-two county hospitals throughout the province have established traditional Chinese medicine departments to carry out traditional Chinese medicine services. In order to carry forward the tradition of traditional Chinese medicine and cultivate traditional Chinese medicine talents, Anhui Province has successively established five traditional Chinese medicine advanced studies schools and two traditional Chinese medicine schools. More than 3,400 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have received advanced studies, and a large number of non-full-time acupuncturists have been trained in rural areas. Lingbi County alone has more than 3,000 people studying acupuncture. Counties and cities have also universally launched the work of Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine, establishing twelve on-the-job training classes for Western medicine to learn traditional Chinese medicine. I study drugs, so I would like to offer some suggestions on how to study Chinese herbal medicines, with three main aspects: research on the plants themselves, chemical research, and pharmacological and clinical research. Regarding research on the plants themselves, the main tasks are as follows:

    (1) Standard Specifications. The efficacy of a herbal medicine depends on the amount of active ingredients it contains, which often varies greatly depending on the growing area, climate, environment, and harvesting time. Taking licorice as an example, its active ingredient is glycyrrhizin. It is produced in North, Southwest, and Northwest China. Some licorice fluid extracts sold on the market contain less than 1% glycyrrhizin, while others contain more than 10%. The Central Ministry of Health stipulated in February 1956 that licorice fluid extract should contain no less than 7% glycyrrhizin and the extract should contain no less than 20%. The Soviet Pharmacopoeia includes 121 natural medicinal plants, all with certain standard specifications, such as source, appearance, purity (referring to active ingredients), and storage conditions. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Sorting Committee of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association has done a lot of work in terms of traditional Chinese medicine specifications. The Ministry of Health will also publish a "Traditional Chinese Medicine Handbook" for relevant parties to refer to as a basis for distinguishing authenticity, quality, and superiority.

    (2) Cultivation Research. The main task is to improve varieties, how to increase the content of various effective substances, and to produce greater efficacy. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the introduction and domestication of wild medicinal plants at home and abroad. In recent years, relevant domestic units have begun to vigorously develop this type of work. Taking the Sichuan State-owned Nanchuan Drug Plantation as an example, dozens of plant drugs are produced this year, such as mint, motherwort, hyoscyamus, angelica dahurica, rhubarb, etc., which are constantly being researched and expanded. When artificially cultivating medicinal plants, we must consider cultivating both domestic and foreign plant medicines, and provide strong assistance in agricultural technology, such as strict management of plant harvesting areas and times, removal of weeds, and prevention and control of pests and diseases. Foxglove, an essential medicine for heart disease, was initially imported from abroad, but now it can be mass-produced domestically.

    (3) Investigation of Wild Plants. On April 7, 1958, the State Council issued instructions that we should make the most of wild plants. According to preliminary investigations, more than 2,000 economic crops and medicinal plants have been discovered. In recent years, more than 100 kinds of wild plants with economic and medical value have been discovered in the Tibet region, and 38 kinds of wild medicinal materials have been discovered in Hainan Island. Radix Rauwolfiae and Clerodendron trichotomum, which are highly valued in the medical field for lowering blood pressure, can be regarded as wild plants and will soon become cultivated plants.

    (4) Introduction and Grafting Work. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, with various climates and soil conditions. Many foreign tropical and subtropical medicinal plants, such as cinchona trees, papaya, senna leaves, eucalyptus trees, etc., can be tested for planting in China or subjected to grafting experiments. Some work has already been done, but some work is not done well enough. According to a preliminary survey by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 37 important drugs are still imported from abroad and can be tested for planting domestically. Now I will talk about the chemical research of plant medicines. Traditional Chinese medicines are mostly plants, which contain varying amounts and different properties of various active ingredients, such as alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, volatile oils, etc., so the efficacy also varies accordingly. In clinical applications, plant medicines are of three types: directly using the original plant, using a mixture of various active ingredients contained in the plant, or using a single active ingredient. Each has its own advantages and can be adopted, or can be adopted simultaneously. The efficacy of the first two types is the sum of the effects of various active ingredients working together. The third type is a pure chemical, and its efficacy and dosage are relatively easy to control. At present, ephedrine, digitalis toxins, atropine, etc., which can be mass-produced domestically, are pure chemicals extracted from relevant plants by chemical methods. This type of work should be strengthened and expanded in the future. If the original plant is used for medicinal purposes, attention should be paid to its specifications. Although various plant medicines belong to the same species, due to climate, environment, cultivation methods, harvesting time, etc., the active ingredients they contain are very inconsistent. Even the same dose may not produce the same efficacy. I have already discussed how to strictly confirm the specifications of plant medicines. Finally, I will talk about the pharmacological and clinical research of plant medicines. Before various important drugs and new drugs are applied clinically, they must undergo systematic pharmacological research in order to understand their efficacy, toxicity, and side effects, and to draw preliminary conclusions. Taking Changshan as an example, it has significant efficacy in treating malaria. After chemical and pharmacological research, it was found to contain a variety of alkaloids, among which Dichroa febrifuga alkaloid has the highest efficacy. Using chickens and ducks for testing, it is 148 times more effective than the same dose of quinine. However, it is easy to cause vomiting after taking it and also has a destructive effect on the liver. Recently, in clinical observations at Shangyi Township, Meishan County, Sichuan, and Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, when Changshan and betel nut are used together to treat malaria, 87% of the observed people did not experience vomiting. Further research is needed on how to reduce Changshan's destructive effect on the liver. At present, medical colleges and universities in China have begun to vigorously develop the pharmacological and clinical work of traditional Chinese medicine. Shanghai Eleventh People's Hospital found that using domestically produced Clerodendron trichotomum to treat hypertension is more effective than using imported snake root preparations. However, strict regulations must be made on the variety and harvesting time of Clerodendron trichotomum, otherwise its efficacy will not be consistent. The above are the steps that must be taken to study traditional Chinese medicine and an effective method to carry forward the legacy of Chinese medicine. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope the delegates will correct and criticize it.

    发扬祖国医药学遗产
    赵承嘏代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政治报告，和李富春、李先念、彭真各位首长的工作报告，我现在对祖国医药学今后发展的趋势，提供一些意见如后。
    经过整风运动，在党的中医政策领导下，中医中药工作出现了空前未有的新面貌，普遍展开中医中药的群众运动，更好地发挥中医中药为生产服务的作用，使中西医合流，创造中国新医学，发扬我国几千年来中医中药的宝贵经验。在中医临床研究方面，已获得了很大成绩，如中医中药治疗高血压、肾炎、肝硬化、传染性肝炎、流行性感冒、乙型脑炎、硬皮症、柳枝接骨等，都取得了肯定的疗效。上海市第十一人民医院及华东医院用针灸治疗急性阑尾炎，疗效在百分之九十五以上，针灸对其他疾病如再生障碍性贫血、血栓闭塞性脉管炎、百日咳、矽肺、哮喘、十二指肠溃疡、胃下垂、子宫颈炎、催乳引产、痛经、聋哑等症，也都疗效很高。苏联也很重视我国医药传统，成立专门机构来进行针灸疗法和其他疗法的科学研究工作。在西医学习中医方面，我国各医疗卫生机构，目前已开始形成热潮，并已取得一定成绩，就安徽省来讲，各级卫生部门认真贯彻执行党的中医政策，几年来全省已吸收中医一千六百四十九人参加国家卫生机构。全省有十六个城市医院和六十二个县医院建立了中医科，开展中医业务。为了发扬祖国医学传统，培养中医人材，安徽省先后建立了五所中医进修学校和两所中医学校，经过进修学习的中医有三千四百多人，在农村训练了大批不脱产的针灸员，仅灵璧一县就有三千多人学习了针灸。各县市还普遍展开西医学习中医的工作，成立了十二个在职西医学习中医班。我是研究药物的，今就如何研究中国植物药提供一些意见，主要工作有三方面，即植物本身的研究、化学研究、药理和临床研究。关于植物本身的研究，主要工作有下列四项。
      （1）标准规格。一种植物药的疗效，视其所含有效成分的多少以为断，其含量常随种植地区、气候环境和采集时间等而发生很大的区别。以甘草为例，其有效成分为甘草皂甙，产我国华北、西南、西北等地，市上出售的甘草流浸膏，有些含皂甙不到百分之一，有些多至百分之十以上。中央卫生部于一九五六年二月规定甘草流浸膏所含皂甙不得少于百分之七，浸膏不得少于百分之二十。苏联药典上所收载的天然药用植物一百二十一种，都有一定的标准规格，如来源、外形、纯度（指有效成分）及储藏条件等。我国药学会中药整理委员会对于中药规格一方面，已做了不少工作。卫生部也将有“中药手册”的发行，以便于有关方面的参考，作为鉴别真伪优劣的依据。
      （2）栽培研究。主要工作为改良品种，如何增加各种有效质素的含量，使发生更大的疗效，同时也要注意到引种和驯化国内和国外的野生药用植物。近年来国内有关单位对于这类工作，已开始大力展开。以四川省国营南川药物种植场为例，今年生产的植物药有数十种，如薄荷、益母草、莨菪、白芷、大黄等，不断加以研究和扩大。在人工栽培药用植物时，既要考虑到栽培本国的植物药，也要考虑到栽培外国的植物药，并在农业技术上加以大力帮助，如在植物的采挖地区和时间加以严格的管理，去除杂草，防治病虫害等。治心脏病要药毛地黄，最初所用的品种是国外来的，现在国内已能自己大量生产了。
    （3）调查野生植物。一九五八年四月七日国务院发出指示，我们要尽量利用野生植物。根据初步调查，已发现两千多种经济作物和药用植物。近年来在西藏地区发现有经济及医疗价值的野生植物一百多种，海南岛发现野生药材三十八种，在医药界很重视的降低血压药物，如萝芙木、如臭梧桐，都可视为野生植物，不久将变为家种植物了。
    （4）引种和嫁接工作。我国地大物博，具有各式各样的气候和土壤条件，许多国外的热带和亚热带的药用植物，如金鸡纳树、番木必、番泻叶、桉树等，都可在国内试种，或进行嫁接试验，有些工作已在进行，有些工作还做得不够。根据中国医学科学院的初步调查，有三十七种重要药物，仍由国外进口，都可以在国内试种的。现在我再谈谈植物药的化学研究工作。中药以植物类为最多，其中所含各种有效成分，如生物碱、肥醣体、皂?、挥发油等，多寡不一，性质不同，因此疗效亦随之而异。在临床上应用的植物药，不外三种类型，或直接用原植物，或用植物中所含各种有效成分的混合体，或用单纯的有效质素，各有所长，都可采用，也可以同时采用。前两种的疗效，是各种有效成分互相配合后所发生出来的作用的总和，第三种是纯粹化学品，其疗效和剂量比较容易掌握。现在国内已能大量生产的麻黄素、毛地黄毒?、阿托品等，都是纯粹化学品，是从有关植物中用化学方法提取出来的。这类工作，今后当再加强和扩大。如将原植物供药用，即当注意其规格，因各种植物药虽属于同一品种，受了气候、环境、栽培方法、采集时间等关系，所含有效质素，极不一致，虽同一剂量，不易发生同等疗效，如何将植物药规格严格的肯定下来，前已谈及了。末了我再谈谈植物药的药理和临床研究工作。各种重要药物和新药物应用于临床以前，必须经过有系统的药理研究，以便了解其疗效如何，毒性如何，副作用如何，同时也就可得出初步结论。举常山为例，治疟疾有显著的疗效，经过化学和药理研究，发现含有多种生物碱，其中以常山碱丙的疗效为最高，用鸡鸭来做试验，大于同等剂量奎宁的疗效一百四十八倍，不过服后易发生呕吐，对肝脏也有破坏作用。最近在四川眉山县尚义乡和成都中医学院临床观察上，如用常山与槟榔为伍治疗疟疾时，未发生呕吐的占观察人数的百分之八十七。关于如何减少常山对肝脏的破坏作用，还要作进一步的研究。现在我国的医药院校对于中药的药理和临床等工作，已开始大力展开，上海第十一人民医院发现用国产臭梧桐治疗高血压症，其疗效比用国外进口的蛇根草制剂要好得多，不过对于臭梧桐的品种和采集时间等要加以严格的规定，否则其疗效也就不能一致。上述种种，是研究中药必须经过的步骤，也是发扬我国医药学遗产的有效方法，是否有当，希各代表们加以指正和批评。
