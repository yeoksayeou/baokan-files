Comrade Representatives:
    I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Premier Zhou and other national leaders, and will resolutely implement the tasks proposed in the reports in my future work. Now, I would like to express some opinions on vigorously launching mass movements in industrial and mining enterprises.
    Taiyuan is a city with rapid industrial development. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, with the support of brother cities and the vast countryside, and through the active efforts of all workers and the people of the city, industrial production and industrial construction have greatly developed, and an industrial base mainly based on smelting, machinery, coal, and chemical industries has been initially formed. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the working class and laboring people of the city gave even greater play to their soaring enthusiasm, increasing the city's total industrial output value by 85.34 percent compared to 1957. The total absolute value of the annual increase was equal to 1.24 times the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan period. The increased output of steel, iron, coal, and electricity in this year was equivalent to or exceeded the total increase in output during the First Five-Year Plan period. The annual production of complete sets of metallurgical, power, mining, and mechanical equipment increased by about ten times compared to 1957. The amount of investment completed in basic construction in this year was also equivalent to more than half of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. The total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 4.7 times compared to 1952 during the period of national economic recovery, and by 21 times compared to 1949. The proportion of the output value of means of production in the total industrial output value has rapidly increased from 59.6 percent in 1949 to 82 percent in 1958. Such a leap-forward development speed was simply unimaginable in the old society.
    Establish Models at All Levels, Establish Models by Type of Work, So That the Socialist Emulation Drive Develops More Broadly, More Deeply, and More Solidly
    The facts of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have made us more deeply aware of the necessity and correctness of vigorously launching mass movements on the industrial front. According to the unified arrangements of the state and the province, this year's industrial production and industrial construction in Taiyuan City will have a greater leap forward than in 1958, whether in terms of output value, output, or engineering projects. To complete and overfulfill such a plan, this year we must continue to advance victoriously under the leadership of the Party, launch a large-scale mass movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy, vigorously promote technological revolution and technological innovation, and rapidly increase labor productivity. Is it possible to realize the plan for a continued Great Leap Forward this year? Judging from the situation in the first quarter, it can already be affirmed that as long as we resolutely implement the Party's policy of increasing production and practicing economy and vigorously launch mass movements, we will surely move from victory to new victory. In the first quarter of this year, the city's total industrial output value increased by 1.11 times compared to the same period last year, and the number of new products successfully trial-produced also increased by 2.5 times compared to the same period last year. Currently, a vigorous and down-to-earth mass movement has emerged in the city's industrial and mining enterprises. Labor emulation campaigns in various forms, such as doubling output, "double thousands," and one-and-a-half quotas, with the goal of high output, high quality, and increased labor productivity, have been launched successively throughout the city. In particular, the emulation campaign has penetrated into the work teams, setting off a movement of learning from and catching up with advanced teams between work teams. With the development of the emulation campaign, the city has widely established models. Many enterprises and units have adopted the method of establishing models at all levels, establishing models by type of work, focusing on advanced teams, and establishing models for workshops, work sections, teams, individuals, and various types of work, so that the socialist emulation drive is developing in a more broad, deep, and solid direction. Based on the experience of the previous stage, we believe that to further develop the annual campaign to increase production and practice economy, the important key lies in continuing to do a good job in grasping the advanced, establishing models, focusing on team emulation, and vigorously launching mass movements on the industrial front.
    Grasping the Advanced, Establishing Models, and Planting Red Flags is an extremely important method for vigorously launching mass movements on the industrial front and encouraging the vast number of workers to strive for the top. It is also a good way to fully utilize the role of advanced individuals and advanced collectives to drive overall leap forward. Since the first quarter of this year, Taiyuan City has greatly promoted the development of mass emulation campaigns by widely establishing models, especially by adopting the method of establishing models at all levels, including city-wide models, as well as models for factories, mines, workshops (work sections), and teams. This facilitates the learning and promotion of advanced experiences from other factories, and also facilitates the summarization of advanced experiences within the unit, promoting each other internally and externally, so that the originally advanced become even more advanced, and the backward quickly catch up with the advanced, achieving the requirement of common improvement more quickly. Under the impetus of the "one-and-a-half quota" model emulation campaign, 61.7 percent of the workers in the Heavy Machinery Factory have reached the level of completing one-and-a-half hours of quota per hour, and 309 people have reached two quotas, and 50 people have reached two-and-a-half quotas. Not only should models be established at all levels, but also in terms of depth, models should be established according to the type of work, and various representative advanced banners should be established according to the production characteristics of different types of work. This can adjust the imbalance between various types of work, and can give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in various positions, further tapping the potential capacity of various types of work. Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory established models in different types of work such as machine repair, smelting, casting, and forging and riveting, and launched a red flag emulation campaign, which increased production efficiency by 11 to 19 times respectively. Thirty-five teams in the factory are able to achieve double quotas on average every day. Establishing models at all levels starts from the commonality in enterprise and team production, which can make the development of the movement more broad and is conducive to the promotion of common advanced experience; establishing models according to the type of work starts from the particularity of different types of work, which can promote the in-depth development of the movement, and greatly facilitates the summary and promotion of the special experience of different types of work. Combining these two methods can make the emulation campaign more widely and deeply developed.
    In establishing models and launching large-scale emulation, we should also focus on establishing models in the teams and extensively launching the emulation campaign of learning from and catching up with advanced teams between the teams. The reason for emphasizing the teams is that the national plan and various indicators of the enterprise are all realized through the teams. The production team is the most basic unit in enterprise production. If we grasp the teams well, the entire factory's leap forward will have a reliable guarantee, the factory's internal emulation can be better carried out, and the inter-factory emulation can have a broad mass base. Moreover, the team itself is a collective organization, and the team model is a collective model, which can not only develop the enthusiasm and initiative of every member of the team, but also better concentrate the wisdom of the masses and develop the collectivist spirit and communist style of close collaboration and mutual assistance and cooperation. The team is also an organization of the type of work, and the emulation of the same type of work can also be combined with the team emulation. Therefore, grasping the team is very important for promoting the widespread and in-depth development of the labor emulation. After the in-depth development of the labor emulation in Taiyuan City this year, it has grasped the team emulation, which quickly created a new situation of vigorous and down-to-earth emulation. In the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory emulation, the Zhao Qi team, which completed half a year's workload in two months, first emerged. The Municipal Party Committee timely summarized and seized this typical example, and established it as a "model" on the city's industrial front. As soon as the banner was established, the group responded, and hundreds of teams in the city immediately visited and studied, and set off a movement of "learning from Zhao Qi and catching up with Zhao Qi." Immediately afterwards, 36 teams completed half a year's workload in three months. The vigorous development of team emulation quickly formed a city-wide emulation climax of you chasing me and me catching up with you. One wave pushes another, and one wave covers another, and the mass movement is carried out vividly and lively. For example, in the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, the Hao Fu team improved the production management of the team in the process of learning from the Zhao Qi team, formulated measures to double production, and proposed 140 innovation suggestions within a few days, which doubled and tenfold increased production efficiency, and completed a year and fifteen days of workload in three months. The Huang Jinrong team of the Jinxi Machine Factory also set off an innovation climax of "improving every machine and doubling every process," which made the average production efficiency increase by 4.5 times. According to statistics as of early April, 92 teams in the city have completed half a year to a year's workload. Many teams in various enterprises have surpassed the level of the original advanced teams, and more teams are striving to catch up and advance to advanced indicators. The original advanced teams have formulated new leap forward plans and are heading for more advanced goals.
    Using the Form of the Industrial Five-Level Cadre Conference to Promote the Accelerated Development of the Mass Movement on the Industrial Front; At the Same Time, Better Organize Regional Collaboration
    In order to adapt to the arrival of the new high tide, we have recently used the form of the industrial five-level cadre conference (including city, district, factory-level leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, workshop cadres, production team leaders, as well as advanced elements and non-advanced elements from the masses) to promote the accelerated development of the mass movement on the industrial front. We also adopted the methods of combining inside and outside the conference, combining leadership and the masses, combining discussion and practical action, and propagandizing, implementing, discussing, and acting at the same time, so that the emulation of the vast number of masses closely revolves around the current production tasks, and quickly set off a continued great leap forward climax centered on revising quota indicators and technical measures, reforming tools, and reforming production design. Through such a conference, on the one hand, the principles, policies, production indicators, methods for completing tasks, and possible difficulties can be directly explained to grassroots cadres and the masses of workers, and on the other hand, the opinions of the masses can be quickly concentrated through the masses' airing of views, full expression of ideas, great debates, and big-character posters. In this way, the masses were quickly mobilized, which enriched the leadership's thinking and allowed for the faster discovery of new problems. Through such a conference, the city is seeing a broader and more profound production leap forward. For example, in the first two or three days of the conference, the coarse grinding workers in the manufacturing workshop of the Taiyuan Cement Factory increased the output of cement from an average of 24 tons per hour in the past to 32 tons.
    While widely organizing mass emulation campaigns, it is also extremely important to better organize regional collaboration. This work can ideologically and organizationally guarantee the implementation of the national chessboard policy and ensure that the mass emulation campaign develops in the right direction. Taiyuan City achieved good results in organizing regular collaboration between industrial and mining enterprises in the city, organizing urban-rural collaboration between industry and agriculture to support each other, and organizing large and medium-sized enterprises to jointly support the construction of new factories during the Great Leap Forward last year. However, since the beginning of this year, some people have had some doubts about organizing collaboration and production in the new situation. They believe that the national chessboard is unified, the plan is unified, or that this year's inventory has decreased, and collaboration is not possible, etc. They do not understand that it is precisely this new situation that makes this year's large-scale collaboration even more important. Because to ensure the national chessboard, to ensure the key points, in addition to relying on the unified arrangements and unified allocation of the state, we must also take measures of mutual collaboration and mutual exchange to adjust the balance of various aspects. Moreover, the more arduous the task of production and construction, and the more tense the raw materials and labor force, the more necessary it is to strengthen collaboration and use the limited human, material, and financial resources in the most urgent needs, the greatest role, and the fastest results. To meet this need, we have further organized regional collaboration of more than 230 units in the city's industrial and mining enterprises, basic construction, transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, and health systems this year, and the facts have further proved the importance of carrying out large-scale collaboration. Taking the machinery system as an example, under the premise of obeying the unified allocation of the state, adopting the method of checking the needs and deficiencies and supplementing the deficiencies with the surplus, more than 2,000 tons of steel and more than 300 tons of pig iron were mutually allocated, solving the needs of 420 key production links. On the issue of labor force, some units have also adopted the method of combining deep tapping of potential and extensive collaboration to transport the labor force to the most urgently needed departments. In the first quarter, the city has adjusted more than 10,000 people, including technicians, to support key units. All these measures have played an extremely important role in ensuring the completion of key projects and key products under the condition of tight raw materials and labor force.
    Through the above aspects of work, the mass movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation in the city is rapidly developing towards a new peak. We believe that as long as the city's workers continue to deeply carry out the mass emulation campaign of increasing production and practicing economy under the leadership of the Party, we will surely set off a new magnificent continued great leap forward climax and successfully complete and overfulfill the national plan for 1959.

　　树标兵　插红旗　大搞群众运动
    岳维藩代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理等国家领导人员向大会所作的各项报告，并将根据报告中所提出的任务在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在，仅就工矿企业中大搞群众运动的问题发表一些意见。
    太原市是一个工业发展较快的城市。几年来，在党的领导下，在兄弟城市和广大农村的支援下，经过全体职工和全市人民的积极努力，工业生产和工业建设都有了很大的发展，并且初步形成了以冶炼、机械、煤炭和化学工业为主的工业基地。在大跃进的一九五八年，全市的工人阶级和劳动人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，更加发挥了冲天的干劲，使全市工业总产值比一九五七年增加了百分之八十五点三四，全年增长的绝对值等于第一个五年计划期间增长总和的一点二四倍。钢、铁、煤、电四种产品在这一年增加的产量，都相当或者超过第一个五年计划期间产量增长的总和。全年生产成套的冶金、动力、矿山、机械等设备，比一九五七年增长了十倍左右。基本建设在这一年完成的投资额，也相当于第一个五年计划投资总和的一半以上。一九五八年的工业总产值，与国民经济恢复时期比较则比一九五二年增长四点七倍，比一九四九年增长二十一倍。在工业总产值中，生产资料的产值所占比重，已由一九四九年的百分之五十九点六迅速上升到一九五八年的百分之八十二。这种飞跃发展的速度，在旧社会是根本不能想像的。
    层层树立标兵，按工种树立标兵、使社会主义竞赛更广泛更深入更扎实地发展
    一九五八年大跃进的事实，使我们更加深刻地认识到在工业战线上大搞群众运动的必要性和正确性。根据国家和省的统一安排，太原市今年的工业生产和工业建设，无论在产值、产量和工程项目方面，都将比一九五八年有更大的跃进。要完成和超额完成这样的计划，今年就必须在党的领导下，继续乘胜前进，大规模地开展以增产节约为中心的群众运动，大闹技术革命和技术革新，迅速地提高劳动生产率。今年是否有可能实现继续大跃进的计划呢？从第一季度的情况看，已经可以肯定地说，只要坚决贯彻党的增产节约方针和大搞群众运动，我们就一定可以从胜利走向新的胜利。今年第一季度全市工业总产值较去年同期增长了一点一一倍，试制成功的新产品也较去年同期增加了两倍半。目前全市工矿企业中，已经出现了一个轰轰烈烈的、踏踏实实的群众运动，以高产优质和提高劳动生产率为目标的产量翻番、“双千分”、个半定额等各种形式的劳动竞赛运动，已经在全市范围内先后开展起来。特别是竞赛运动深入到小组，掀起了小组与小组之间的学先进赶先进运动。随着竞赛运动的发展，全市广树标兵，许多企业单位采取了层层树立标兵，按工种树立标兵，以先进小组为重点，从车间、工段、小组、个人到各个不同的工种都树立了标兵，使社会主义竞赛朝着更广泛更深入更扎实的方面发展。根据前一阶段的体会，我们认为，要把全年的增产节约运动进一步开展起来，重要的关键在于继续做好抓先进，树标兵，以小组竞赛为重点，在工业战线上大搞群众运动。
    抓先进、树标兵、插红旗，是在工业战线上大搞群众运动，鼓舞广大职工力争上游的一个极其重要的方法。也是充分发挥先进人物和先进集体的作用，带动全面跃进的良好形式。太原市今年第一季度以来，由于广树标兵，大大促进了群众竞赛运动的发展，特别是采取了层层树立标兵的方法，既有全市的标兵，又有厂矿、车间（工段）、小组的标兵，这样，既便于学习、推广外厂的先进经验，又便于总结本单位的先进经验，内外互相促进，使原来先进的更先进，后进的迅速赶上先进，更快地实现了共同提高的要求。重型机器厂在“个半定额”标兵竞赛的推动下，全厂已有百分之六十一点七的工人达到了每小时完成一个半小时的定额水平，并有三百零九人达到两个定额，五十人达到两个半定额。不仅要层层树立标兵，而且在纵深方面，还要按工种树立标兵，根据不同工种的生产特点，分别树立各种有代表性的先进旗帜。这样，既可以调整各工种之间发生不平衡的现象，又能发挥各个不同岗位职工的积极性和创造性，进一步挖掘各工种的潜在能力。太原矿山机器厂在机修、熔铸、锻铆等不同工种中树立标兵，大搞红旗竞赛，使生产效率分别提高了十一倍到十九倍，全厂并有三十五个小组平均每天都能达到双定额。层层树立标兵，是从企业、小组生产中的共同性出发，可以使运动发展更加广阔，有利于推广共同性的先进经验；按工种树立标兵，则是从不同工种的特殊性出发，可以促进运动的纵深发展，大大便利于总结和推广不同工种的特殊经验。把这两种方法结合起来，就能使竞赛运动更加广泛深入地开展。
    在树立标兵大搞竞赛中，还应该着重在小组中树立标兵，广泛开展小组之间的学先进赶先进的竞赛运动。所以强调小组，是因为国家的计划，企业的各项指标，都是通过小组实现的，生产小组是企业生产中最基本的单位，抓好小组，全厂跃进才有可靠的保证，厂内竞赛才能更好地开展，厂际竞赛也才能有广泛的群众基础。而且，小组本身又是一个集体的组织，小组标兵是集体标兵，既能发扬小组每一个成员的积极性和主动性，又能更好地集中群众智慧，发扬密切协作和互助合作的集体主义精神和共产主义风格。小组并且也是工种的组织，开展同工种的竞赛也可以和小组竞赛相结合。因此，抓好小组一环，对于促进劳动竞赛的广泛深入开展，是非常重要的。太原市今年的劳动竞赛深入开展以后，便抓紧了小组竞赛这一环，使竞赛迅速出现了一个既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实的新局面。山西机床厂竞赛中首先涌现出两个月完成半年工作量的赵歧小组。市委及时总结和抓住这一典型，树立为全市工业战线上的“标兵”，旗帜一树，群起响应，全市立即有上百个小组经过参观、学习，掀起了“学赵歧、赶赵歧”运动，紧接着就有三十六个小组在三个月内完成了半年工作量。小组竞赛的蓬勃发展，迅速形成了一个全市性的你追我赶的竞赛高潮。一浪推一浪，一浪盖一浪，群众运动生动活泼地开展起来了。如山西机床厂的郝福小组在学习赵歧小组运动中，改进了小组的生产管理，制定了生产翻番的措施，几天之内便提出革新建议一百四十项，成倍、成十倍地提高了生产效率，三个月便完成了一年又十五天的工作量。晋西机器厂的黄金荣小组并掀起了“车车改进，道道（工序）翻番”的革新高潮，使生产效率平均翻了四番半。目前截至四月初的统计，全市已有九十二个小组完成了半年至一年的工作量。各企业有不少小组已经赶过了原来的先进小组的水平，更多的小组正在奋起直追，向先进的指标挺进，原来的先进小组又订出了新的跃进计划，奔向更先进的目标。
    运用工业五级干部会议的形式，推动工业战线群众运动的加速发展；同时更好地组织地区性的大协作
    为了适应新高潮形势的到来，最近，我们运用了工业五级干部会议（包括市、区、厂级领导干部、工程技术人员、车间干部、生产小组长以及群众中的先进分子和非先进分子）的形式，来推动工业战线群众运动的加速发展。我们并采取了会内和会外相结合、领导和群众相结合、讨论和实际行动相结合，以及边宣传、边贯彻、边讨论、边行动等方法，使广大群众的竞赛紧紧围绕当前的生产任务进行，迅速掀起了以修改定额指标和技术措施，改革工具，改革生产设计为内容的继续大跃进高潮。通过这样的会议，一方面可以把方针、政策、生产指标、完成任务的方法以及可能出现的困难，直接向基层干部和职工群众交代清楚，另一方面通过群众的大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报，又可以迅速把群众意见集中上来。这样，就迅速地发动了群众，从而丰富了领导思想，可以更快地发现新问题。通过这样的会议，全市正在涌现一个更广阔更深刻的生产大跃进。如太原水泥厂制造车间粗磨工人在大会召开的第二、第三两天内，即将水泥的产量由过去平均每小时生产二十四吨提高到三十二吨。
    在广泛组织群众竞赛运动的同时，更好地组织地区性的大协作也是极为重要的。这一工作可以从思想上、组织上保证全国一盘棋的方针的贯彻，保证群众竞赛运动沿着正确的方向发展。太原市在去年大跃进中，在组织全市工矿企业之间的经常性协作，组织工业和农业之间相互支援的城乡协作，组织大中型企业共同支援新厂建设的协作方面，曾经发生了良好的成效。但是，今年以来，有些人在新形势下对组织协作生产了某些怀疑，他们认为全国一盘棋，计划统一了，或者说今年库存减少了，不能协作等等。他们不了解，正是这种新形势，才使得今年的大协作更加具有重要的意义。因为要保证全国一盘棋，要保证重点，除了依靠国家统一安排、统一调拨外，还必须采取互相协作、互通有无的办法，来调剂各方面的平衡。而且，生产建设任务越繁重，原材料和劳动力越紧张，就更要通过加强协作，把有限的人力、物力、财力用到最迫切需要、作用最大和收效最快的地方。适应这种需要，我们今年又进一步组织了全市工矿企业、基本建设、交通运输、财经贸易、文教卫生等系统二百三十多个单位的地区性协作，事实更加证明了开展大协作的重要性。以机械系统为例，在服从国家统一调拨的前提下，采取核算需缺，以余补缺的办法，便相互调剂了二千多吨钢材、三百多吨生铁，解决了四百二十项生产关键的需要。在劳动力的问题上，有些单位也采取深挖潜力和广泛协作相结合的办法，把劳动力输送到最迫切需要的部门。全市第一季度已经调整了包括技工在内的一万多人支援了重点单位。所有这些措施，对于保证重点工程和重点产品在原材料和劳动力紧张的情况下完成任务起了极重大的作用。
    经过以上各方面的工作，全市以技术革命和技术革新为中心的群众运动正在迅速向新的高峰发展。我们相信，只要全市职工在党的领导下，继续深入开展增产节约的群众竞赛运动，就一定能够掀起一个新的波澜壮阔的继续大跃进高潮，胜利完成和超额完成一九五九年的国家计划。
