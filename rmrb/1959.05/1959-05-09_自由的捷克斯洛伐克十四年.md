　　Fourteen Years of Free Czechoslovakia
　　Czechoslovakia　Z. Schuritz
    It has been fourteen years since the Soviet army entered Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, which rose up against the German fascist occupiers. The Soviet army liberated our country, which is a historically significant milestone in our country's development. Liberation enabled Czechoslovakia to carry out a national democratic revolution, hand over power to the people, and strike the most stubborn pillar of domestic capitalism, because the revolution nationalized 60% of industry, especially key industrial sectors, and returned the land to the working peasants. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia did not stop after achieving the goals of the national democratic revolution. The Party's policy was oriented towards a gradual transition to socialist revolution. This process was completed in February 1948, when the attempted rebellion by the bourgeois remnants was defeated. The working class, which held power, formed a close alliance with the working peasants and other working people and embarked on the road of building a socialist society.
    The fact that Czechoslovakia embarked on the path of socialism has profound international significance. This is because it was the first relatively industrialized country to embark on the road of building socialism. As everyone knows, when Western countries could not deny the great achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, they spread a theory that socialism was only suitable for economically backward countries and not for industrialized European countries. However, Czechoslovakia belonged to those economically more developed countries during the capitalist period. Although its land area was small and its population was small, it was among the ten most industrialized countries in the world.
    It has been fourteen years since Czechoslovakia was liberated. In the development of society, fourteen years is not a long time, but this period is enough for us to give a clear answer to the above argument. What achievements have we made in the past fourteen years?
    Capitalist Czechoslovakia spent a full nine years after the First World War to reach the pre-war industrial production level. But now it only took three years to restore the industrial production level before the Second World War, although the damage caused by the Second World War to industry was much greater.
    Socialist Czechoslovakia has created conditions for the rapid development of industry and the entire economy. The following figures for the annual increase in industrial production clearly illustrate this. (Each year's index is compared with the previous year, with the previous year being 100)
　　Year　1949　1950　1951　1952　1953　1954　1955　1956　1957　1958
　　Index　114　116　114　118　109　104　111　109　110　111.3
    In 1958, the level of industrial production exceeded more than twice the level of pre-war capitalist Czechoslovakia. Such a rate of development has never been seen in the pre-war republic or any capitalist country. During the capitalist period, Czechoslovakia's production only increased by 27% in total from 1934 to 1937. For comparison, we can take the UK and the US as examples. The United States, in its fastest period of growth—between 1880 and 1890—averaged 8.7% annual production growth, while the UK averaged between 3.5% and 4.5% annually between 1820 and 1840.
    The rapid development of production in certain backward regions of the republic, especially the Slovak region, is of particular significance for the correct solution of the Czechoslovak national question. During the capitalist period, Slovakia was an agricultural appendage of the industrialized Czech region. But now the situation has completely changed. In 1957, industrial production in the Czech region increased by 1.6 times the pre-war level, while Slovakia increased by 5.8 times during the same period. Slovakia has become an industrial and agricultural region with a developed and modern industry.
    The widespread upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement in recent years is of historical significance for Czechoslovakia's development towards socialism. Now, agricultural cooperatives have been established in 80% of the countryside. When we think of how deeply capitalism had penetrated agriculture in Czechoslovakia, and how people had been educated for generations that the private ownership of land was inviolable, the great significance of this change becomes even more apparent. The cooperativization movement has created conditions for Czechoslovakia to establish a highly mechanized and modern socialist agriculture.
    The living standards of our working people are constantly and rapidly improving. The living standards of the working people have far exceeded those of Czechoslovakia during the capitalist period. Lowering the prices of retail goods has become a regular phenomenon in our country. Since 1953, prices have been reduced seven times, saving the nation's residents 17.5 billion crowns (Czech currency) annually. At the same time, average incomes are also increasing year by year. For example, the average wage of workers in 1953 was 1,138 crowns, and in 1958 it reached 1,325 crowns. Therefore, the cost of living is constantly decreasing. The following table clearly demonstrates this situation:
    Development of the cost of living index
　　Year　1953　1954　1955　1956　1957　1958　1959 (March)
　　Employee families　100　88.8　86.5　84.2　82.5　82.4　79.7
　　Farmer families　100　85.6　82.0　79.6　78.5　79.1　76.2
    Today, workers can buy much more with their wages than they could during the capitalist period. The following table fully illustrates this point:
    What a worker can buy with a day's wage:
　　      1937    1959
    Sugar　　2.6 kg　　5.7 kg
    Butter　　1 kg　　1.5 kg
    Lard　　1.1 kg　　2 kg
    White flour　　5.7 kg　　14.5 kg
    Rice　　5.4 kg　　9.2 kg
    Soap　　3.3 kg　　7.6 kg
    Men's shirts (ten days' wages)　　6 shirts　　14 shirts
    Children's clothing for nine-year-olds (ten days' wages)　　1.8 items　　4.2 items
    The main issue now is to continue to improve the quality of food, so that it fully meets the needs of the harmonious physical and mental development of socialist people, and meets the requirements of modern nutritional science. Meeting the needs for durable consumer goods (televisions, motorcycles, automobiles, etc.), the development of service industries, and housing construction are becoming increasingly prominent. Now, the living standards of the Czechoslovak working people in this regard are already very high. We have all the necessary conditions to catch up with and surpass the most economically developed capitalist countries in terms of overall living standards in a relatively short period of time.
    Now, Czechoslovakia will build socialism in the next few years and embark on the road of gradually transitioning to communism alongside the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. What has enabled Czechoslovakia to achieve these achievements? Where does the source of these achievements lie?
    Undoubtedly, this lies first and foremost in the great superiority of the socialist system. The new socialist relations of production have opened up roads for the rapid development of productive forces. At the same time, the correct policy of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is the source of all these achievements. The Party creatively applies Marxism-Leninism in the formulation and practical implementation of its policy line, and is good at utilizing the superiority of the socialist system. The Party resolutely rejected the "theories" of the Yugoslav revisionists and actively exposed this hostile ideology of the working class. Creatively applying the historical conclusions of the 20th and 21st Congresses of the CPSU under our conditions is of particularly great significance for the further development of Czechoslovakia. This policy of the Party has won the unanimous support of all the working people of our country.
    The Party consistently relies on the masses of working people in its work, and constantly strives to expand the participation of the working people in the leadership and management of state affairs and the national economy. The Party's practice of submitting the most important issues concerning the further development of the country and the national economy to the entire working people for discussion before deciding on them has become a rule. For example, this is the case with the draft Second Five-Year Plan, the draft reform of the organization and management of industry and construction, the proposals for increasing agricultural production, and the measures for further improving living standards. The working people have put forward tens of thousands of opinions and suggestions that have made the measures to be taken even more perfect.
    These measures by the Party and the government have greatly encouraged the initiative of the people. This year, many factories have significantly increased their planned tasks, launched a widespread socialist competition from the beginning of the year, and, following the example of the Soviet communist labor teams, launched a competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team". The working people used the slogan "Work in a socialist way, live in a socialist way" to show the purpose of the competition. The Party and the trade unions have given great attention to this movement to promote the cultivation of new socialist people.
    It is unimaginable that socialist Czechoslovakia could have achieved these achievements if it were not a member of the fraternal family of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the guarantee of Czechoslovakia's freedom and independence. Without the help of the Soviet Union, without the closest cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, Czechoslovakia could not have advanced at such a speed. For example, the Soviet Union ensures the uninterrupted supply of many raw materials that our country lacks. The Soviet Union supplies us with millions of tons of iron ore, a large amount of petroleum, cotton, and other raw materials every year.
    Of course, Czechoslovakia cannot be compared with large countries like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in terms of area, population, or economic potential. But the people of Czechoslovakia clearly know that they have their own small contribution to make in the peaceful competition between the two social systems. Although we have not, like the people of the Soviet Union and China, set the goal of catching up with and surpassing the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of absolute production volume, we will not do so in the future, but we want to catch up with and surpass these countries in terms of per capita production, and Czechoslovakia has all the necessary conditions to achieve this goal in the next few years. The 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia formulated a concrete program for completing socialist construction in our country, and also put forward concrete guidelines for economic development by 1965. Upon completion of this guideline, the level of industrial production will reach six times that of Czechoslovakia during the capitalist period, and our many basic products will catch up with and surpass the existing levels of the most developed capitalist countries in the world, including the United States, in terms of per capita production. For example, by 1965, we will not only exceed the current per capita production of West Germany and France, but we will also exceed today's production of the United States, except for electricity.
    The task of building socialism in our country, put forward by the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, has become a concrete program for all workers, peasants, and intellectuals in Czechoslovakia, and they are working enthusiastically to realize this program. We are willing to use our cause to make all the working people of the world ultimately recognize the truth that is now understood by the majority of mankind, that is: all roads lead to communism.

　　自由的捷克斯洛伐克十四年
　　捷克斯洛伐克　兹·舒里茨
    自从苏军进入奋起反对德国法西斯占领者的捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格以来，已经过去十四年了。苏军解放了我国，是我国发展中具有历史意义的里程碑。解放使捷克斯洛伐克能够进行民族民主革命，把政权交到人民手中，并且打击了国内资本主义的最顽强的支柱，因为革命把60％的工业，特别是关键性的工业部门收归国有，把土地归还给了劳动农民。捷克斯洛伐克共产党在实现了民族民主革命的各项目标以后，并没有止步。党的政策是以逐步向社会主义革命过渡为方向的。1948年2月，当资产阶级残余分子发动叛乱的企图被击败以后，这一个过程就完成了。掌握了政权的工人阶级同劳动农民和其它阶层的劳动人民结成了紧密的联盟，走上了建设社会主义社会的道路。
    捷克斯洛伐克走上社会主义道路的事实，具有深远的国际意义。因为这是第一个工业相当发达的国家走上了建设社会主义的道路。大家知道，当西方国家无法否认苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就时，就散布一种论调，说社会主义仅仅适合于经济落后的国家，而对工业发达的欧洲国家则不适合。但捷克斯洛伐克在资本主义时期就已属于那些经济上比较发达的国家之列，虽然它的国土面积小，人口少，但已名列世界十个工业最发达的国家之中。
    捷克斯洛伐克解放以来，已经有十四年了。在社会的发展中，十四年并不算长，但这一时期已足以使我们给上述论调作出明确的回答。十四年来我们究竟有些什么成就呢？
    资本主义的捷克斯洛伐克在第一次世界大战后花了整整九年的时间才达到战前的工业生产水平。而现在只用了三年时间就恢复了第二次世界大战以前的工业生产水平，尽管第二次大战给工业造成的损害要大得多。
    社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克为工业和整个经济的高速发展创造了条件。下列工业生产每年增长的数字可以明显地说明这一点。（每年的指数都是与前一年作比较，前一年为100）
　　年份　1949　1950　1951　1952　1953　1954　1955　1956　1957　1958
　　指数　114　116　114　118　109　104　111　109　110　111.3
    1958年工业生产水平超过战前资本主义捷克斯洛伐克的水平两倍以上。这样的发展速度是战前的共和国和任何资本主义国家所没有过的。在资本主义时期，捷克斯洛伐克的生产从1934年到1937年总共才提高了27％。为比较起见，我们可举英美为例。美国在上升最快的时期——1880—1890年间，生产每年平均增长8.7％，而英国在1820—1840年，每年平均增长3.5％到4.5％。
    迅速发展共和国某些落后地区的生产，特别是斯洛伐克地区，对正确解决捷克斯洛伐克的民族问题，有着特殊的意义。在资本主义时期，斯洛伐克曾是工业发达的捷克地区的农业附属地区。但是现在的情况完全变了。1957年捷克地区的工业生产比战前的水平提高了一点六倍，斯洛伐克在同一时期却提高了五点八倍。斯洛伐克已变成一个拥有发达的现代化工业的工农业地区。
    最近几年来农业合作化运动的广泛高涨，对捷克斯洛伐克向社会主义的发展具有历史性的意义。现在，农业合作社已在80％的农村中建立起来。当我们想到资本主义在捷克斯洛伐克曾深深渗入农业，人们世世代代都受着土地私有关系不可侵犯的教育的时候，这个变化的伟大意义就更显著了。合作化运动为捷克斯洛伐克创造了条件，使它能建立起高度机械化的现代化的社会主义农业。
    我国劳动人民的生活水平不断地迅速提高。劳动人民的生活水平已远远超过资本主义时期的捷克斯洛伐克。降低零售商品的价格在我国已成为经常现象。自从1953年以来价格已降低七次，使全国居民每年节约一百七十五亿克朗（捷币）。与此同时，平均收入也在逐年提高。例如，1953年工人平均工资是一千一百三十八克朗，在1958年已达到一千三百二十五克朗。因此生活费用不断降低。下表明显地证明了这个情况：
    生活费用指数的发展
　　年份　1953　1954　1955　1956　1957　1958　1959（3月）
　　职工家庭　100　88.8　86.5　84.2　82.5　82.4　79.7
　　农民家庭　100　85.6　82.0　79.6　78.5　79.1　76.2
    今天工人用自己的工资可以买到的东西比资本主义时期多得多。下表可以充分说明这一点：
    一个工人用他一天的工资可以买：
　　      1937年    1959年
    糖　　2.6公斤　　5.7公斤
    黄油　　1公斤　　1.5公斤
    猪油　　1.1公斤　　2公斤
    白面　　5.7公斤　　14.5公斤
    大米　　5.4公斤　　9.2公斤
    肥皂　　3.3公斤　　7.6公斤
    男用衬衫（十日工资）　　6件　　14件
    九岁儿童服装（十日工资）　　1.8件　　4.2件
    现在主要的问题是继续改善食品质量，使它完全符合社会主义人们体力和脑力和谐发展的需要，符合现代营养科学的要求。满足长期消费品（电视机、摩托车、汽车等）的需要，服务业的发展以及房屋建筑问题，越来越显著地提到面前。现在，在这方面捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的生活水平已是很高的了。我们具备一切必要条件在比较短的时期内在总的生活水平方面赶上和超过经济最发达的资本主义国家。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克将在最近几年内建成社会主义，并同苏联和其它社会主义国家并肩踏上逐步过渡到共产主义的道路。是什么使捷克斯洛伐克获得这些成就呢？这些成就的泉源在哪里呢？
    无疑地，这首先在于社会主义制度的伟大优越性。新的社会主义的生产关系为生产力的快速发展开辟了道路。同时，捷克斯洛伐克共产党的正确政策是这一切成就的泉源。党在政策路线的制定和实际贯彻中创造性地运用马克思列宁主义，并善于利用社会主义制度的优越性。党坚决地拒绝了南斯拉夫修正主义者的“理论”，并积极地对这一工人阶级的敌对思想进行了揭露。创造性地在我们的条件下运用苏共第二十次和二十一次代表大会的历史性结论，对捷克斯洛伐克进一步发展有着特别巨大的意义。党的这种政策获得我国全体劳动人民的一致拥护。
    党在自己的工作中一贯依靠劳动人民群众，并不断努力扩大劳动人民参加国家事务和国民经济的领导和管理。党在决定国家和国家经济进一步发展的最重要问题以前，先将这些问题提交全体劳动人民讨论的作法，已经成为法则。例如，对第二个五年计划草案、工业和建筑业的组织管理的改革草案、提高农业生产的建议以及进一步提高生活水平的措施等都是如此。劳动人民提出了数万条使将要采取的措施得以更加完善的意见和建议。
    党和政府的这些措施大大地鼓舞了人民的积极性。今年许多工厂显著地提高了计划任务，从年初起就广泛展开了社会主义竞赛，并追随苏联共产主义劳动队的榜样，开展了争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛。劳动人民用“以社会主义方式劳动，以社会主义方式生活”的口号表明竞赛的目的。党和工会对这个促进培养社会主义新人的运动给予了很大的关怀。
    社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克如果不是以苏联为首的社会主义国家兄弟般的大家庭的成员，要获得这些成就是不可想像的。苏联是捷克斯洛伐克自由和独立的保障。没有苏联的帮助，没有同苏联、同中华人民共和国和其它社会主义国家的最紧密的合作，捷克斯洛伐克是不能以这样的速度前进的。例如，苏联确保我国所缺少的许多原料的供应不致间断，苏联每年供给我们数百万吨铁砂，大量石油、棉花和其它原料。
    当然，捷克斯洛伐克不论在面积、人口或在经济潜力方面，都不能与苏联和中华人民共和国这样的大国相比。但捷克斯洛伐克的人民清楚地知道，他们在两个社会制度的和平竞赛中有着自己微小的贡献。尽管我们没有像苏联和中国人民一样，提出在生产的绝对产量上赶上和超过最先进的资本主义国家的目标，我们将来也不会这样做，但我们想在按人口平均的生产上赶上并超过这些国家，而且捷克斯洛伐克有一切必要条件在最近几年达到这一目标。捷共第十一次代表大会制订了在我国完成社会主义建设的具体纲领，也提出了到1965年经济发展的具体方针。完成这一方针，工业生产的水平将达到资本主义时期的捷克斯洛伐克的六倍，我国的许多基本产品将在按人口计算的生产上赶上和超过包括美国在内的世界上最发达的资本主义国家现有的水平。例如，到1965年，我们不仅将超过西德和法国现在按人口计算的生产，而且除电力外我们也将超过美国今天的生产。
    捷共第十一次代表大会提出的在我国建成社会主义的任务，已成为捷克斯洛伐克全体工人、农民和知识分子的具体纲领，他们正为这一纲领的实现而热情地劳动着。我们愿以自己的事业促使全世界所有的劳动人民都最终地认识到今天已为人类大多数所理解的道理，那就是：一切道路都通向共产主义。
