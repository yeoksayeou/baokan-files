Comrades,

I fully agree with and resolutely support Premier Zhou's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. The reports point out our country's magnificent achievements in last year's all-round leap forward, taking steel as the key, and the development like ten thousand horses galloping ahead. People's communes have been universally established in the vast rural areas. Everywhere in our country is a scene of vigorous vitality, prosperity, and happiness. Building on the tremendous achievements already made last year, this year we will achieve an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

Our country's steel production increased from 5.35 million tons in 1958 to 11.08 million tons, an increase of 5.73 million tons. This is an unprecedented increase in history. In 1959, it will further increase to 18 million tons, a planned increase of 6.92 million tons. The total increase over two years is 12.65 million tons. At the same time, pig iron production increased from 5.94 million tons in 1958 to 13.69 million tons, an increase of 7.75 million tons. It is planned to reach 23 million tons in 1959, an increase of 9.31 million tons. The total increase over two years is 17.06 million tons. These figures, whether in percentage or in absolute terms, are extremely large. On the basis of the original not-very-high production level, continuous growth of such a large quantity fully demonstrates the superiority of our socialist system. We can hardly find suitable words to describe the amazing speed of the development of our country's steel industry. However, we can use a comparison with the steel growth of other countries to illustrate the magnificent spirit of our people's cause. In 1900, Britain's steel production was roughly 4.9 million tons, and it was not until 1953 that it reached 17.89 million tons. In 1896, West Germany's steel production was roughly 5 million tons, and it was not until 1943 that it reached 18.32 million tons. That is to say, on the road to steel production, it is conceivable that completing such a magnificent plan is not easy. Why can such a miracle be realized in our country? In addition to the conditions of our country having a large population, a large territory, and abundant resources, the most fundamental thing is that our country has a superior socialist system, the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the selfless assistance given to us by socialist brother countries, especially the Soviet Union. It is also the result of the Party Central Committee's proposal to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, as well as the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, foreign methods of production and indigenous methods of production, and the correct policies and principles of combining centralized leadership in industry with large-scale mass movements in industry. It is an achievement made under the correct leadership of the Party, with the people of the whole country filled with soaring enthusiasm for building socialism and developing a soaring spirit.

Now I will talk about the leap forward in black metallurgy design work and some of my experiences:

(1) First of all, through the rectification movement led by the Party, putting politics in command, and breaking down dogma and superstition, the thinking of the design personnel has been liberated. There has been a leap forward in design work. For example, in the past year, several design institutes have completed general designs for complete sets of iron and steel joint ventures ranging from 10,000, 30,000, 50,000... to 600,000 tons, and completed a series of designs for large and small steel rolling workshops and steel rolling mills (including section steel rolling mills, steel plate rolling mills, steel pipe rolling mills, and wire rod rolling mills, etc.). They have completed a series of designs for large and small blast furnaces (from 3 cubic meters, 8 cubic meters, 13 cubic meters, 28 cubic meters... to 1513 cubic meters blast furnaces) and a series of designs for converters (converters with a capacity of 1 ton, 3 tons, 6 tons, and 12 tons). This not only ensured the design of key large factories but also undertook the design of small and medium-sized iron and steel plants in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. In terms of coking and refractories, in addition to completing coking workshops and refractory workshops of different sizes, they also promoted the "Red Flag" coke ovens and "Red Flag" refractory kilns, combining foreign and indigenous methods.

(2) Under the leadership of the Party, the design work has launched large-scale mass movements, broken down conservative ideas, and greatly accelerated the design speed, basically reversing the passive situation where the drawings could not keep up with the construction requirements. The design of a joint venture that used to take a year to complete can now be done in about half a year or even less. Because of the serious implementation of the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift and the appropriate combination of our country's current specific conditions, combined with the different content of design projects, and differentiated treatment, it has now been achieved that the investment in a unit product of a joint venture can be reduced by about half compared with the past. This allows the same capital construction investment to achieve double the effect.

(3) Through the rectification movement, labor training, and production practice, the design personnel have made great progress in their thinking, and theory has been linked to practice. In the past year, in addition to cadres being sent down for training and participating in steel production, the design institutes have also organized design groups in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and sent a large number of design personnel to conduct on-site design in various places. Design personnel have more opportunities to go deep into reality to understand the actual local conditions, understand the intentions and special requirements of the locality, and facilitate the acquisition of basic design data, and can discuss with local production and construction units to obtain close contact and collaboration, and learn from the experience of production and construction. Through such practice, theory can be easily combined with practice, improving technical level, and bringing about significant changes in thinking. Under the leadership of local Party committees, a large number of our design work comrades, together with local work comrades, selflessly and tirelessly persisted in hard and happy labor in every corner of the motherland for the grand cause of the motherland's steel construction, in order to make their contributions to overfulfilling the target of 18 million tons of steel. With the frequent joint design work with local comrades, new design forces have grown up in various places.

(4) New achievements have also been made in the application of new technologies due to the Party's support and encouragement. For example, continuous casting facilities have been established in some factories. The unique snail-drum-shaped and straight-barrel-shaped side-blown alkaline converters in our country have been designed. These provide the conditions for the large-scale and rapid development of steelmaking in our country. The design of large converters and new steelmaking workshops has also been carried out.

(5) In the great leap forward work last year, combined with the path of developing the steel industry in our country and the policy of combining large, medium, and small, some design experiences of "small factories becoming large" and the arrangement of general layout under certain conditions were explored, so that the iron and steel plants built by some localities are not only easy to start, but also easy to expand into larger-scale iron and steel enterprises in the future. The significance of combining large, medium, and small and the relationship between the development and changes of small factories becoming large has been further realized. Because our country's current conditions cannot provide a large number of heavy equipment to build many huge joint ventures in a short period of time, we must build more decentralized small and medium-sized factories while building large backbone factories. These small and medium-sized factories are convenient for utilizing decentralized resources, convenient for obtaining equipment, convenient for shortening construction time, and can quickly cultivate new technical forces, laying the foundation and preparing for the construction of large factories.

(6) There have also been some new achievements in how to specifically implement the combination of foreign and indigenous methods. In last year's design work, the design institute learned and summarized the steel pipe rolling mill created by workers of the Shanghai Yongxin Steel Plant, and designed the 76 mm seamless steel pipe rolling mill combining foreign and indigenous methods. This kind of pipe rolling mill has few equipment, is easy to manufacture, and easy to master and operate. The construction time is about three months, and it can be put into production. Each set of such rolling mills can produce about 10,000 tons of steel pipes below 76 mm per year, and the unit investment per ton of product is only about one-third of that of a large rolling mill. It is suitable to build such workshops in small and medium-sized factories to produce steel pipes to solve the urgent needs of various constructions. Now this kind of rolling mill has been tested by production and is being manufactured and installed in a large number of factories. After these workshops are built, coupled with several large rolling mills, they can roughly meet the needs of rolling pipes of various specifications.

In addition, the design institute learned and summarized the operation of small blast furnaces created by Hunan, Sichuan and other provinces in our country. Combined with the characteristics of foreign blast furnaces and the specific conditions of our country, a series of small blast furnaces combining foreign and indigenous methods from 3 cubic meters, 8 cubic meters, 13 cubic meters to 55 cubic meters were designed. It requires less equipment, can be simplified, is quick to build, and is relatively easy to operate. It can be built in a decentralized manner near iron ore and coal mine resources, avoiding a large amount of ore and coke transportation, and rapidly increasing the output of pig iron in our country. Now some 8-cubic-meter blast furnaces can produce 12 to 13 tons of pig iron every day, and blast furnace staff across the country are advocating that the utilization coefficient of various small blast furnaces should reach more than one ton of output per cubic meter of effective volume per day. Under the condition of properly selecting raw materials, qualified pig iron can be produced completely. Now these small blast furnaces have been widely established in various parts of our country. In addition to the coastal and major provinces and regions, on Hainan Island, Changbai Mountain, and in the Tianshan Mountains of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, you can see this type of blast furnace releasing torrents of molten iron. Of even more far-reaching significance is that a large number of technical workers and technical personnel are being trained in front of these small blast furnaces. Once these small foreign groups are expanded, they will be able to master large blast furnaces and other smelting work. This year, a large number of small blast furnaces combining foreign and indigenous methods will bear the glorious task of completing the production of 23 million tons of pig iron together with new large blast furnaces with a high degree of mechanization. In addition to this, there are many other examples that I will not elaborate on. The above are all the great achievements created by the Party's leadership, the whole people running the steel industry, and the great mass movement of ten thousand horses galloping forward.

Although the design work has made great progress in the past short period of time, the strength of black metallurgy design in our country is, after all, a seedling that has grown up under the cultivation of the Party and the help and support of Soviet experts. It is still very young. The technical level is still very poor. The ideological level also cannot keep up with the requirements of the development of our country's situation. In addition to our own more efforts, we also need strong help from all aspects.

In order to better complete the task of 18 million tons of steel this year, and the even greater tasks in the future, we have the responsibility to learn more humbly from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries. We must be more vigilant in examining the shortcomings in the design work, and better improve the level of class consciousness and ideology, to undertake the greater, more glorious, and more arduous tasks that the Party will entrust to us.

In future work, we need to attach importance to research work, and rely on research work and the test of practice to gradually make more and better new designs. Through hard work, practical work, and clever work, we will strive to reach the internationally advanced level of black metallurgy factory design in a short period of time.

For the 18 million tons of steel, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute has sent a large number of technical personnel to manufacturing plants, construction sites, and production workshops to learn and summarize experience, and assist in the smooth installation and commissioning of new workshops this year.

We, the personnel of the black metallurgy design work, like the comrades on other fronts, are fortunate to live in the great era where one day in the motherland is equal to twenty years, and live in the era illuminated by the brilliance of the Party and Chairman Mao. We are excited and proud. We have unparalleled ambition and soaring spirit. We believe that our strength can move mountains and seas. We firmly believe that the hands of the six hundred million hardworking and brave people, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, will surely create a brilliant miracle in the history of steel; and in the near future, we will build our country into a brilliant and glorious communist paradise.

The imperialists and foreign reactionaries, colluding with the reactionary elements of the upper strata in Tibet, are attempting to interfere in our country's internal affairs, split our country, restore the imperialist aggressive forces in Tibet, and maintain the reactionary, dark, and cruel rule over the Tibetan people in the past. This attempt to turn the wheels of history backward is simply a daydreaming delusion. They have already suffered a shameful defeat. The Indian interventionist elements have condoned thugs to openly slander our country and our most beloved head of state, which is outrageous and has exceeded the limit that our people can tolerate. Our anger has reached the extreme. I solemnly warn the Indian interventionist elements to rein in their horses before it is too late, immediately put away their ambitions to interfere in our country's internal affairs and sever our country, and consider the friendship between China and India as soon as possible. The 600 million Chinese people have stood up. Regardless of region or ethnicity, we are united under the leadership of the Communist Party, and we are carrying out socialist construction with soaring energy. We love peace, but this is not weakness. We have the confidence to carry out magnificent economic construction. We have the determination to defend our construction achievements and the integrity of our national sovereignty. Six hundred million people are united like steel, and have the strength to crush any conspiracy. I resolutely support all the decisions and measures of our government on this issue, and I pay tribute to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army troops who quickly quelled the Tibetan rebellion.

　　黑色冶金设计工作的跃进
    孙德和代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并坚决拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理与彭真副委员长的报告。报告中指出了我国去年在各方面以钢为纲全面跃进的辉煌成就，万马奔腾般的发展。在广大农村普遍建立了人民公社。在我国到处是蓬蓬勃勃、繁荣幸福的景象。在去年已经取得的巨大成就上，今年我们将要取得更大更好更全面的跃进。
    我国钢产量一九五八年由五百三十五万吨提高到一千一百零八万吨，增长五百七十三万吨。这是历史上少有的增长。一九五九年进一步增长到一千八百万吨，计划增长量是六百九十二万吨。两年的总增长量是一千二百六十五万吨。与此同时生铁的生产量在一九五八年由五百九十四万吨增长到一千三百六十九万吨，增长了七百七十五万吨。一九五九年计划达到二千三百万吨，增长量是九百三十一万吨。两年总的增长量是一千七百零六万吨。这些数字无论在百分比上，或是在绝对数上看，都是极为巨大的。在原有生产水平不很高的基础上，连续增长这样大的数量，充分说明了我国社会主义制度的优越性。我们几乎找不到适当的字眼来形容我国钢铁事业发展的惊人速度。但是可以用与其他国家钢铁增长的情况的对比来说明我们人民事业的宏伟气概。英国一九○○年产钢大致为四百九十万吨，到一九五三年才达到一千七百八十九万吨。西德一八九六年产钢大致五百万吨，到一九四三年才达到一千八百三十二万吨。那就是说在钢铁生产的道路上，可以想像完成这样一个宏伟计划不是轻而易举的。为甚么能够在我国实现这样的奇迹呢？除去我国具有人口多，地方大与资源丰富的条件以外，最根本的是我国有优越的社会主义制度，共产党与毛主席的正确领导，以及社会主义兄弟国家，特别是苏联给予我们的无私援助。也就是党中央提出鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线和工业与农业、重工业与轻工业、中央工业与地方工业、大型企业与中小型企业、洋法生产与土法生产同时并举，以及工业方面的集中领导必须同在工业方面大搞群众运动相结合等一整套用两条腿走路的正确方针政策的结果。是在党的正确领导下全国人民充满了建设社会主义的高涨的热情，发扬了冲天干劲而取得的成就。
    现在我谈一谈黑色冶金设计工作方面的跃进情况与我的一些体会：
    （一）首先通过党领导的整风运动，政治挂帅，大破教条迷信，设计人员的思想得到了解放。在设计工作上有了飞跃的发展。例如去年一年中几个设计院完成了成套的从一万、三万、五万……到六十万吨的钢铁联合企业的通用设计，完成了一系列的大大小小轧钢车间与轧钢机的设计（包括型材轧机、钢板轧机、钢管轧机与线材轧机等）。完成了一系列的大小高炉的设计（从三立方公尺、八立方公尺、十三立方公尺、二十八立方公尺……到一千五百一十三立方公尺的高炉）一系列的转炉的设计（一吨、三吨、六吨、十二吨容量的转炉）。这样既保证了骨干大厂的设计，还承担了全国各省市自治区中小规模钢铁厂的设计。在焦化与耐火方面除去完成大小规模不同的炼焦车间，耐火车间以外，还推广了洋土结合的红旗焦炉和红旗耐火材料窑。
    （二）设计工作在党的领导下大搞群众运动，打破了保守思想，设计速度大大加快了，基本上扭转了图纸赶不上施工要求的被动情况。以往需一年做完的联合企业的设计，现在大约只须半年或更短一些的时间。因为认真的贯彻了勤俭建国的方针与适当的结合我国当前的具体条件，结合设计工程项目内容的不同，有区别的对待，现在已经作到一个联合企业单位产品的投资，大致可以比以往减少一半左右。这样便可以使同样的基建投资，达到双倍的效果。
    （三）通过整风运动，劳动锻炼和生产实践，设计人员在思想上有了巨大的进步，理论联系了实际，在去年一年中除了干部下放锻炼和参加钢铁生产以外，各设计院还组织了在各省市自治区的设计组，派出了大量的设计人员在各地就地进行设计，设计人员更有机会深入实际了解当地的实际条件，体会地方的意图与特殊要求，便于取得设计的基础资料，并能与地方上的生产基建单位进行商讨，取得密切的联系与协作，并学习生产与施工方面的经验。通过这样的实践，理论便容易与实际相结合，提高了技术水平，在思想上也起了重大的变化。我们的大量设计工作的同志在各地党委领导下，他们忘我的与当地工作同志们一起在祖国的各个角落，为着祖国钢铁建设的宏伟事业，夜以继日的坚持着辛勤而愉快的劳动，为的是超额完成一千八百万吨钢作出他们的贡献。随着与当地的同志们经常的共同进行设计工作，各地成长了新的设计力量。
    （四）在应用新技术方面也由于党的支持与鼓舞有了新的成就。例如在某些厂建立了连续铸锭的设施。设计了我国特有的蜗鼓形与直筒形侧吹碱性转炉。提供了我国大量与高速发展炼钢的条件。也进行了大型转炉与新的炼钢车间的设计。
    （五）在去年大跃进的工作里结合了我国发展钢铁工业的道路，大中小相结合的方针，摸索了一些在一定条件下“小厂化大”的设计经验与总图布置的安排，使一部分地方建设的钢铁厂，既便于上马，也便于将来扩建为更大规模的钢铁企业。进一步体会了大中小相结合的意义与小厂变大的发展变化的关系。因为我国目前条件在短期内还不能提供大数量的重型设备建设很多的巨大的联合企业，必须在建设大型骨干工厂的同时，多建一些分散的中小型厂，这些中小型厂便于利用分散的资源，便于取得设备，便于缩短建设时间，并可以很快培养出新生的技术力量，为大厂建设奠定基础，作好准备。
    （六）怎样具体贯彻执行洋土并举方面，也有了一些新的成就。在去年的设计工作里，设计院学习总结了上海永鑫钢铁厂工人创造的钢管轧机，设计了洋土结合的七十六公厘无缝钢管轧机。这种轧管机设备不多，易于制造，易于掌握操作。建设时间大约三个月，就能投入生产。每套这类轧机可以年产一万吨左右的七十六公厘以下的钢管，每吨产品的单位投资只相当于大型轧管机的三分之一左右。适宜于在中小型厂内建立这样的车间，生产钢管解决各种建设的迫切需要。现在这样的轧机已经经过生产的考验，并在大量制造安装在很多的厂里。这些车间建成以后再配合若干大型轧管机，便能大致满足各种不同规格轧管的需要。
    另外设计院学习总结了我国湖南四川等省创造的小高炉的操作。结合洋高炉的特点与我国的具体情况设计了一系列的从三立方公尺、八立方公尺、十三立方公尺到五十五立方公尺洋土结合的小高炉。它需要设备不多，可以因陋就简一些，建设快操作比较容易，可以分散建设在靠近铁矿煤矿资源附近，避免大量矿石与焦炭运输，并使我国生铁产量迅速得到增长。现在有的八立方公尺的高炉每天已能生产十二、三吨的生铁，各地高炉工作人员正在倡导在各类小高炉利用系数达到每天每立方公尺有效容积产量为一吨以上。在原料条件选择适当的情况下，完全可以生产出合格的生铁。现在这些小高炉已普遍的建立在我国各地。除去沿海及主要省区以外，在海南岛、长白山，在新疆维吾尔自治区的天山，都可以看到这一类型的高炉放出奔流的铁水来。具有更为深远意义的是这些小高炉的炉前正在培养出大量的技术工人与技术人员。一旦将这些小洋群扩大时，他们便能够掌握大高炉与其他冶炼工作。在今年我国大量的洋土结合的小高炉将与新型的机械化程度高的大型高炉一同负担起完成二千三百万吨生铁生产的光荣任务。除此以外还有很多例子不一一详述。以上都是党的领导，全民办钢铁事业，大搞群众运动万马奔腾所创造的丰功伟绩。
    虽然设计工作在过去短短的时间内有很大的发展，但是我国黑色冶金设计的力量到底还是在党的培植与苏联专家帮助扶持下生长出来的一枝幼苗。它还非常年青。技术水平还很差。思想水平也还赶不上我国形势发展的要求。除去我们本身更多努力以外，还需要各方面的大力帮助。
    为了今年更好的完成一千八百万吨钢的任务，与今后更为巨大的任务，我们有责任更虚心的学习苏联及其他国家的先进经验。更加警惕检查在设计工作中的缺点，更好的提高阶级觉悟思想水平，来承担党将交给我们的更大、更光荣也更艰巨的任务。
    在今后的工作里，我们需要重视研究工作，依靠研究工作与实践的考验来逐步作出更多更好的新的设计。通过苦干、实干、巧干争取短期内达到黑色冶金工厂设计国际先进水平。
    为了一千八百万吨钢，黑色冶金设计院已派出了大批技术人员到制造厂，到施工工地，到生产车间学习与总结经验，并协助今年新车间顺利安装投入生产。
    我们黑色冶金设计工作的人员与其他战线上的同志一样，幸运的生活在祖国一天等于二十年的伟大时代，生活在党和毛主席的光辉照耀着的时代，我们兴奋、自豪。我们有无比的雄心与冲天干劲。我们相信我们的力量能移山倒海。我们坚信六亿勤劳勇敢人民的双手在党和毛主席的正确领导下，一定会创造出钢铁历史上光辉的奇迹；并在今后不长的时间里，将我国建成为灿烂光辉的共产主义乐园。
    帝国主义者和外国反动派，同西藏上层反动分子勾结在一起，企图干涉我国内政，分裂我们国家，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，维护过去在西藏人民头上的反动、黑暗残酷的统治，这种使历史车轮倒转的企图简直是白日做梦的妄想。他们已经遭到可耻的失败。印度干涉主义分子放纵暴徒公开对我国及我们最敬爱的国家元首进行污蔑，实是令人发指，已经超过了我国人民能够容忍的限度。我们的愤怒达到极点，我严正警告印度干涉主义分子急早悬崖勒马，即时收起干涉我国内政与割裂我国的野心，早日为中印友谊着想。中国六亿人民已经站起来了，我们不分地区不分民族在共产党的领导之下，团结在一起，干劲冲天地在进行着社会主义建设。我们热爱和平，但这不是软弱，我们有信心进行宏伟的经济建设。我们有决心保卫我们的建设成果与祖国主权的完整。六亿人民团结如钢，有力量粉碎任何阴谋。我坚决拥护我国政府关于这一问题的一切决定与措施，我并向迅速平定西藏叛乱英勇的中国人民解放军部队致敬。
