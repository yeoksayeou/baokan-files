　　The Sino-Czech Friendship Flower on the Bohai Beach
　　——Remembering the Young Mechanics of the State-owned Sino-Czech Friendship Farm in the Spring Sowing Campaign
　　Yang Zhen
　　The spring plowing and sowing of the State-owned Sino-Czech Friendship Farm is about to end, and as people celebrate their victory, it is just before the eve of the 11th National Day of Czechoslovakia. The young mechanics who were trained by Czechoslovak experts happily recalled the days they spent with the experts two years ago, and excitedly saw the flowers of Sino-Czech friendship blooming on the Bohai beach. More than two years ago, just as the farm was being prepared for construction on the Bohai beach and there was a lack of agricultural machinery, our close friends, the Czechoslovak government and people, generously sent a complete set of modern agricultural machinery equipment and dispatched more than ten experts to train the first batch of mechanics for the farm. In this spring sowing, Jie Wanyu, who has won the mobile red flag five times in a row, was a young man who was taught hand-in-hand by experts at that time. Now, Jie Wanyu is a burly and energetic young man. He also serves as the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the second mechanical team. During the first days of deep plowing on the desolate Bohai beach, expert Novak patted Jie Wanyu on the shoulder and said, "You really understand the Czechoslovak locomotives. From very, very far away, I can hear your car's sound particularly loud." Today, not only is Jie Wanyu's car still sounding loud, but the cars driven by the new drivers he has trained also sound as majestic as all the Czechoslovak locomotives.
　　This year is the first year that the crystallization of Sino-Czech friendship, the State-owned Sino-Czech Friendship Farm, has been fully put into production. This farm has a planting area of nearly 130,000 mu. At the beginning of March, when the spring sunshine began to shine on the Bohai beach and the ground had just thawed, Jie Wanyu and many young drivers began spring plowing, working from dawn till dusk. In the first red flag competition, the 35K locomotive driven by Jie Wanyu and his co-driver Liu Hongjiang won the mobile red flag with a work efficiency of more than 50 mu of cultivated land per shift. However, when he heard that the No. 1 car, which was ten horsepower smaller than his car, also won the red flag with a shift efficiency of nearly 50 mu, he felt that there was still great potential for increasing production and saving! He and the captain mobilized the vehicles to learn from the No. 1 car. They also proposed: handovers and refueling should be done in the field, and meals and vehicle maintenance should be done without going home. From then on, the fields were filled with shuttle-like locomotives, and no one was willing to delay for a second. The team's work efficiency quickly increased. Jie Wanyu and his co-driver Liu Hongjiang successively created new records of cultivating 85 to 88 mu of land per shift. Gong Qiming, a driver at the experimental field, became anxious when he heard the news. His car was also a 35K, so why did he only cultivate 30 to 40 mu per shift? Was the team leader being conservative by not allowing him to drive faster than "second gear"? The captain saw what he was thinking and said: Czechoslovak experts have said that the speed of the car should be adjusted according to the weight of the car's load. These words suddenly liberated Gong Qiming's thinking. He then adjusted according to the car's load, sometimes "second gear" and sometimes "third gear," and, like Jie Wanyu, did his refueling, meals, and vehicle maintenance in the field. As a result, he broke the shift efficiency record of cultivating 100 mu of land for several consecutive days, reaching a maximum of 127 mu, with a depth of 24 centimeters, exceeding the quota by more than half.
　　Jie Wanyu and many red flag drivers, like Gong Qiming, created new records by carefully understanding the principles explained by the experts and flexibly applying them in their operations.
　　Wang Songli, a driver of the No. 8 locomotive and a classmate of Jie Wanyu, did not go home to see his wife, whom he had not seen for two or three years, during the Spring Festival. Instead, he used his holidays to review the notes taken by the Czech experts over and over again. As he read those clear, concise, and easy-to-understand sentences, it was as if experts such as V. Nadrazsky had come to his side. As he looked at the notes, he thought of the experts in his heart. At the beginning of spring plowing, he said to people: According to the notes, the potential of the car is still great! When harrowing, he broke the saying that a car can only hang one disc harrow, and instead hung two disc harrows and drove slowly. In this way, he harrowed dozens of acres more land per shift than with one disc harrow. At the same time, driving the car slower also reduced the wear and tear on the car. He created a miracle of harrowing nearly 500 mu of land per shift. It was as if a reservoir had opened its floodgates, and the mechanics' thinking became more enlightened. Many drivers tapped the potential of their cars, changing double-furrow plows to three-furrow plows and changing from one car carrying one seeder to carrying two. At this time, Wang Songli further calculated the load weight of the car and changed to using one car to carry three seeders, increasing the sowing shift efficiency from nearly 400 mu to nearly 800 mu, exceeding the quota by one time. Dong Weisheng, the driver of the No. 10 locomotive who was sowing in the same field as him, learned his method overnight and created an even more astonishing miracle—a sowing shift efficiency of 1,027 mu.
　　Wang Songli is not only good at studying the theories explained by experts, but he is also good at learning the communist style of the experts, like many mechanics. At the beginning of spring plowing, he had a small quarrel with his co-driver Xing Zhentang. For two days in a row, the two of them sulked, and neither of them clearly explained the subtle changes in the car during their shift handover. As a result, there was not enough understanding of the car, accidents increased, and work efficiency decreased. Wang Songli was so distressed that he couldn't sleep. He thought of the Czechoslovak experts, who were full of communist style, and couldn't help but feel ashamed. He immediately went to the field, took Xing Zhentang's hand, and said, "I was wrong the day before yesterday." The knot between the two was immediately untied. One day, Xing Zhentang's wife came, and Wang Songli, who had just finished the day shift, rushed to take Xing Zhentang's night shift. Xing Zhentang was very moved and returned to the field before his shift started.
　　During the intense battle of spring plowing and sowing, the repairmen who were personally trained by the Czechoslovak experts, like the experts, were thinking all day long: How can we reduce and promptly eliminate vehicle failures? One evening, a picture floated before the eyes of repairman Wei Jingyan: Expert Redchek, who was over fifty years old, was suffering from chronic back pain and braving the scorching sun on the Bohai beach, sweating profusely, and giving everyone a machinery lesson over and over again. What a moving memory! It suddenly gave member Wei Jingyan endless strength. He immediately went home to say goodbye to his young wife, carried some parts and tools, and took a broken overcoat with him, accompanying the locomotives in the field day and night. Wherever the car broke down, he would repair it there. The spring night was bitterly cold, but as he looked at the bright car lights and listened to the normal car sounds, his heart was always warm. Sometimes he was so tired that he would lie down on the newly cultivated black soil for a while. As long as a car stopped somewhere, he would suddenly wake up. Han Chunyan, a repairman in the fifth district, sat on the edge of the field one late night and suddenly stroked his hands again and again. He felt a warmth in his heart: Wasn't this pair of hands that can repair machines given to me by Czechoslovak experts? If I give this pair of hands to more people, wouldn't I be able to increase production and save even more? From that day on, whenever he found a car malfunction, he would not only teach everyone how to fix it, but also explain the principles of prevention and troubleshooting in conjunction with physical objects. Only thirty days into the spring sowing, the team's tractor drivers had already mastered dozens of techniques for preventing and troubleshooting faults. In this way, there was less work for Han Chunyan to do, so he made dozens of tools and parts for maintaining and repairing vehicles. In the past, to check the circuit, one had to go to the general farm's repair shop. Now, he has created a circuit check lamp, which can be checked anytime, anywhere.
　　When everyone sees the results of spring plowing and sowing, they cannot help but think of our close friends, the Czechoslovak experts. That unspeakable feeling of gratitude is growing day by day. Just like the sentiment expressed by V. Nadrazsky, the leader of the Czechoslovak machinery expert team, in a recent letter: "Although thousands of miles separate us, our hearts are always together; the flower of Sino-Czech friendship on the Bohai beach will bloom more and more luxuriantly and never wither!"

　　渤海滩上的中捷友谊之花
　　——记国营中捷友谊农场在春播战役中的青年机务人员
    杨振
    国营中捷友谊农场的春耕春播就要结束了，人们欢庆胜利的时候，正是捷克斯洛伐克第十一届国庆的前夕。受过捷克斯洛伐克专家培养的青年机务人员，愉快地回忆起两年前和专家们相处的日子，兴奋地看到中捷友谊的花朵正在渤海滩上开放。两年多以前，正当渤海滩上准备建设农场，缺乏农业机械的时候，我们亲密的友人——捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民，无偿地送来全套现代化的农业机械装备，并且派来十多名专家，为农场培养了第一批机务人员。在这次春播中，接连五次荣获流动红旗的解万瑜，就是当时专家搿着手教练的一个少年。现在，解万瑜已是一个身体魁梧、浑身是劲的壮实小伙子。他还担任第二机务队的共青团副支部书记。在渤海荒滩上，第一次深翻土地的日子里，诺瓦克专家曾经拍着解万瑜的肩膀说：“你真正了解捷克斯洛伐克的机车，从很远很远的地方，就听到你开的车声音特别洪亮。”今天，不但解万瑜开的车，声音仍然是那样洪亮，而且他带领出来的几个新驾驶员开的车，也都和所有的捷克斯洛伐克机车一样，台台声音雄壮。
    今年，是中捷人民友谊的结晶——国营中捷友谊农场全面投入生产的第一年，这个农场种植面积近十三万亩。3月初，春光开始照临渤海滩，地面刚刚化冻的时候，解万瑜就和许多青年驾驶员一块儿，起早贪黑地开始了春耕。头一次红旗竞赛，解万瑜和同车驾驶员刘洪江开的35K机车，就以每班耕地五十多亩的工效荣获流动红旗。但是，他听说比他的车小十个马力的一号车，也以近五十亩的班工效荣获红旗，就觉得增产节约的潜力还大着哩！他就和队长一起，发动车车向一号车学习。他们还提出：交班、添油在地头，吃饭、养车不回家。从此，地里日夜是穿梭般的机车，谁也不肯耽误一秒钟，全队工效迅速上升。解万瑜和同车的刘洪江都先后创造每班耕地八十五亩到八十八亩的新纪录。试验场的驾驶员龚其明一听发了急，自己的车也是35K，为什么一个班次只耕三十来亩或四十来亩呢？车长不准他开车超过“二速”是不是保守呢？队长看出了他的心思说：捷克斯洛伐克专家说过，车的速度是应当根据车负荷的重量来调整的。这话使龚其明的思想一下子解放了，他就根据车的负荷情况，时而“二速”，时而“三速”，添油、吃饭、保养车也像解万瑜一样在地里。于是，他一连几天突破了耕地班工效一百亩，最高达到一百二十七亩，深度二十四公分，超过定额一倍半以上。
    解万瑜和许多红旗驾驶员，都跟龚其明一样，都是在一面认真理解专家讲的原理、一面在操作中灵活运用才创造了新纪录。
    解万瑜的同窗学友，八号机车的驾驶员王松立，在春节期间，他没有回家去看看阔别了两三年的妻子，却利用假日一次又一次地温习捷克专家们所讲述的笔记，他念着那些清晰简短易懂的句子，就好像专家瓦·拿得拉斯基等同志来到了自己的身边。他边看笔记，边在心里想念着专家们。春耕一开始，他就对人说：从笔记里看，车的潜力还大着呢！耙地的时候，他就破除了一车只能挂一盘耙的说法，改挂两盘耙，开慢车。这样，一个班次就比挂一盘耙多耙地好几十亩。同时，车开慢了，还可减轻车的磨损。他一举创造了耙地班工效近五百亩的奇迹。这好像水库打开了闸门，机务人员的思想更加开窍了。许多驾驶员都挖开车的潜力了，把双铧犁改成三铧犁，把一车带一台播种机改为带两台。这时王松立又进一步计算了车的负荷重量，改用一车带三台播种机，把播种班工效由近四百亩提高到近八百亩，超过定额一倍。和他在一块地里播种的十号机车驾驶员董维生，连夜学他的样子，创造了一个更加惊人的奇闻——播种班工效达到一千零二十七亩。
    王松立不光善于钻研专家讲的学理，他还像很多机务人员一样，善于学习专家们的共产主义风格。春耕开始的时候，他曾和同车的邢振堂闹过一点小别扭，一连两天，两人都闷着气，交班时，谁也不把车子在本班驾驶时的细微变化讲清。这样，对车子的了解不够，事故多了，工效下降。王松立苦恼得睡不着觉。他想起了充满了共产主义风格的捷克斯洛伐克专家们，不觉惭愧起来。他立刻到地里去拉着邢振堂的手说：“我前天错了”。两人的疙瘩一下子解开了。有一天，邢振堂的爱人来了，王松立刚干了日班，就又抢着替邢振堂值夜班。邢振堂很感动，不到上班时间，就返回地里了。
    在春耕春播的紧张战斗中，捷克斯洛伐克专家们亲手培养的修理工们，也都像专家那样，成天在想：怎样才能减少和及时排除车辆的故障。一天傍晚，修理工韦京燕眼前浮起一幅图画：五十多岁的红查克专家，带着长期腰疼的病，正冒着渤海滩上的烈日，汗流浃背地，一遍又一遍地在给大家讲机务课。这是多么动人的回忆啊！它给团员韦京燕突然增加了无穷的力量。他立刻回家告别了年轻的妻子，背了一些零件和工具，挟了一件破大衣，到田野里日夜伴着机车。车在哪儿坏了，他就在哪儿修。春夜寒气逼人，可是，他望着明亮的车灯，听着正常的车声，心里总是暖呼呼的。有时候实在乏了，就倒在新耕的黑土上躺一会。只要哪里车一停，他就会突然惊起。五区修理工韩春彦，一天深夜里，坐在地头上，突然一次又一次地抚摸起自己的手来。他心里感到一阵阵的温暖：这双能修理机器的手不正是捷克斯洛伐克专家送给我的吗？把这双手再送给更多的人，不就能更多地增产节约吗？打这天起，他一发现车出故障，就一面教给大家怎样排除，一面结合实物讲解预防和排除的道理。春播才进行了三十来天，全队的拖拉机手，就已经掌握了数十种预防和排除故障的技术。这样，需要韩春彦动手修的活路少了，他就自制了几十种保养车辆和修理车辆的工具、零件。过去检查电路，要到总场修配厂去，现在，他创造了一种电路检查灯，随时随地都可以检查。
    当大家看到春耕春播的成绩的时候，更不能不想念起我们亲密的朋友——捷克斯洛伐克的专家们。那种说不尽的感激心情，正在与日俱增。正像捷克斯洛伐克机务专家组长瓦·拿得拉斯基同志在不久前的一封来信中说的心情一样：“虽然数千里路把我们隔开，但是我们的心永远是在一起；渤海滩上的中捷友谊之花，将越开越茂盛，永不雕谢！”
