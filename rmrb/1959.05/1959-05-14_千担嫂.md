    "Thousand-Load Sister-in-Law"
    Jiangxi Provincial Gan Opera Troupe Chun Hong
    In the past, when the term "sister-in-law" was mentioned, people often thought of stay-at-home housewives. However, in the first production upsurge after the people's communes were established, the sisters-in-law formed an inextricable bond with rice paddies and fertilizer; among them, heroes emerged, accumulating fertilizer, turning the fields, doing everything. In the past, they were weighed down by firewood, rice, oil, and salt, hardly able to breathe, but now, with thousands of pounds of fertilizer on their shoulders, they still move like the wind between the field ridges. On the day of the fertilizer accumulation high-yield campaign in the Chishan People's Commune of Pingxiang, Jiangxi, 357 sisters-in-law accumulated more than a thousand loads of fertilizer. Therefore, people called them "Thousand-Load Sisters-in-Law."
    The name "Thousand-Load Sister-in-Law" is very clear, accurate, vivid, and resounding. It has brought about a revolution in the old concept of a sister-in-law. Therefore, I think that the nicknames of our era also show a new style. If, in the past, only Li Kui could be called Black Whirlwind, then in this great historical era of surging tides, many heroic figures can strive for such titles. Moreover, it is "the more the merrier," like Han Xin commanding troops. The name of a hero is no longer the exclusive preserve of one person, but is available to those who are capable, which further demonstrates its popular character.
    "Thousand-Load Sister-in-Law" will also change in the future. For example, in another one, two, three, or five years, some of the current "Thousand-Load Sisters-in-Law" may become chemical fertilizer experts, and some may become livestock feed nutritionists. The loads will also be replaced by machinery. Wouldn't the name "Thousand-Load Sister-in-Law" then have to be replaced by a new one?

### “千担嫂”

    “千担嫂”
    江西省赣剧团  春红
    过去，一提大嫂这个名词，人们常常会想到婆婆妈妈的家庭妇女。但是，在人民公社化后的第一个生产高潮里，大嫂们和稻田、肥料结了不解之缘；她们之中，英雄辈出，积肥翻田，什么都干。过去是柴米油盐压得喘不过气来，如今千斤肥担压在肩上，却还在田塍间来往如飞。江西萍乡赤山人民公社在积肥高产日那一天，便有三百五十七位大嫂积肥数达到千担以上。于是，人们管她们叫“千担嫂”。
    “千担嫂”这名字，十分鲜明、准确、生动、响亮。它把旧的大嫂的概念，来了一个革新。因而，我就想到我们这一时代的绰号也表现了新的风格。如果说，过去只有李逵才能叫黑旋风，而在我们这个风起云涌的伟大历史时代，许多英雄人物都能争取到这样的称号。而且是“韩信将兵，多多益善”。英雄之名，再不是某个人所独占，而是能者有份，这就更大的显示了它的人民性。
    “千担嫂”将来也会要变的。比如再过一、二年或三、五年，现在的“千担嫂”那时有的也许成为化学肥料专家了，有的也许成为牲畜饲料的营养学家了，担子也会被机械代替，那么，“千担嫂”的名号，不是也就要有新的来代替了么？
