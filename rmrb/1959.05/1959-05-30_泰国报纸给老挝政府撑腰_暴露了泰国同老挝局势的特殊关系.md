Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch from Bangkok: The Thai newspaper "Seri Communication" published an editorial on the 20th concerning the Lao situation, portraying the Lao Phoui Sananikone government's actions of abandoning the Geneva Accords and attacking the former Lao Fighting Forces as it "having no choice but to suppress the rebellion by force."

The editorial also offered suggestions to the Lao government, saying, "We believe that the Lao situation has become so tense that the government cannot control it, and therefore this government has no choice but to declare a state of emergency." It also said, "This Lao war is not a common war, and Thailand cannot rest easy."

This editorial exposes the relationship between Thailand, as a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military group, and the Lao government's recent launch of a civil war that threatens peace in Indochina. For several years, Thailand has been used by the United States as a forward base for carrying out conspiracies against Laos and Cambodia. The United States has instigated Thailand to come forward and organize the so-called "Mekong Three-Country Military Alliance" and the "Buddhist Group," attempting to drag Laos and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc as well.

    泰国报纸给老挝政府撑腰
    暴露了泰国同老挝局势的特殊关系
    新华社28日讯　曼谷消息：泰国“自由通讯报”在20日就老挝局势发表的社论，把老挝培·萨纳尼空政府毁弃日内瓦协议、进攻前寮国战斗部队的行动说成是它“不得不以武力平叛”。
    社论还对老挝政府出主意说，“我们认为，老挝局势已经紧张到使政府无法控制的地步，因而这个政府不得不宣布非常时期法令。”它还说，“这次老挝战争，并非一般战争，泰国不能高枕无忧。”
    这篇社论暴露了作为东南亚条约军事集团成员国的泰国同老挝政府最近发动内战、威胁印度支那和平的行动的关系。几年来，泰国一直被美国利用来作为向老挝和柬埔寨进行阴谋活动的前进基地。美国曾经指使泰国出面组织所谓“湄公河三国军事联盟”和“佛教集团”，企图把老挝和柬埔寨也拉进东南亚侵略集团。
