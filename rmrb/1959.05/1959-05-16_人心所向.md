Popular Sentiment
Ma Tieding

    A news item concerning the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet reads as follows: "On April 17th, while crossing the Qilila Snow Mountain, two soldiers from a certain unit of our army, Zhou Shirong and Yan Yuyun, who had fallen behind due to foot pain, encountered the remnant troops of the rebel cavalry leader Buyao Xi near Luoxu. The two soldiers immediately opened fire with their submachine guns in three bursts, killing three rebels and wounding one. The rebel leader Buyao Xi, in a panic, led his remaining troops to surrender. The two soldiers captured ninety-six rebels, seizing twenty-nine rifles, one pistol, fourteen homemade guns, ninety-five horses, seventy-six knives, and six hundred and thirty-nine bullets."
    Indeed, wherever our great army goes, the enemy collapses, disintegrates, and crumbles at the mere sight of our forces, or even without being touched.
    Is it because their weapons are inferior? Yes, their weapons cannot be considered good.
    Is it because their command is incompetent? Yes, their command skills are indeed lacking.
    However, the invading army of British imperialism, which once had sophisticated weaponry and strong command, was beaten bloody against the iron walls of the Tibetan people.
    Two People's Liberation Army soldiers, with two submachine guns, were not necessarily superior compared to twenty-nine rifles and other large quantities of weapons. Nearly one hundred rebels, without any fighting spirit, surrendered. …
    Ultimately, this illustrates one thing: the inclination of the people's hearts is a constantly influential factor; all reactionaries isolated from the people, no matter how rampant they may be, are ultimately paper tigers. As long as the people are awakened and organized, the enemies of the people will sooner or later embark on a largely identical path: collapsing at the mere touch, or collapsing even without being touched...
    Whom do the Tibetan people's hearts lean towards? And whom do they turn their backs on? They turn their backs on the reactionaries, on the danger of having their eyes gouged out, their noses cut off, their tendons drawn, and their bodies torn into five pieces; they turn their backs on the horse fees, feed fees, grass fees, mattress fees, Lapu fees, and other extortionate demands under various pretexts. They turn their hearts towards the Communist Party, towards Chairman Mao, towards the Central People's Government, towards the People's Liberation Army, towards the broad road leading to freedom and happiness, towards the unity and unification of the socialist motherland, towards the singing of Najiuma! Do you know Najiuma's song? Najiuma was originally a slave girl from the Deqin Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan. She lost her husband early in life and begged for food far away, wandering twenty-five times in her life. After Yunnan was liberated, this slave girl was reborn, no longer oppressed and exploited, no longer having to wander around, and her life gradually improved. Feeling happy, she began to "sing eternally," "dancing with her hands and stomping with her feet." She sings:
            "Chairman Mao is a pure gold sun
            Warming the hearts of the Tibetans
            Smoothing the wrinkles on my face
            I, Najiuma, have also become a true young person."
    Najiuma's path is the path of all the Tibetan people, and it is also the path of the Tibetan people in the Tibet region. Her song is the song of all the Tibetan people, and it is also the song of the Tibetan people in the Tibet region. This song represents the direction of the development of the times!
    The bright sun shines brightly, with endless brilliance, everything is renewed, flourishing; suppressing the rebellion, democratic reform, the Tibet region has awakened. The hearts of the Tibetan people in the Tibet region are closely linked with the hearts of all ethnic groups in the country.
    Popular sentiment is where destiny lies, and the Tibetan people will inevitably rise up and use their own hands, and indeed use their own hands, to shatter the chains of slavery! The road to happiness ahead of the Tibetan people is vast and boundless!

    人心所向

    有关西藏平叛新闻一则如下：“我军某部在4月17日翻越启里拉雪山时，因为脚痛而掉队的战士周士荣、严玉运二人，在罗许附近和叛匪骑兵布交西残部遭遇，这两个战士当时端起冲锋枪只打了三个点射，打死叛匪三名，打伤一名。匪首布交西慌忙率领残部举手投降。两名战士俘掳九十六名叛匪，缴获步枪二十九支、手枪一支、土枪十四支、马九十五匹、刀七十六把、子弹六百三十九发。”
  真是大军所至、敌人土崩瓦解、望风披靡，或则一触即溃，或则不触即溃。
    是它们的武器不良吗？是的，武器不能算好；
    是它们的指挥无能吗？是的，指挥的才能也确实差劲。
    然而，英帝国主义的侵略军，曾是武器精良，曾是指挥坚强的，却在藏族人民的铜墙铁壁之下碰得头破血流。
    两名解放军战士，两支冲锋枪，比起二十九支步枪、还有其他大量武器来，也不见得占什么优势。近百名叛军，全无斗志，举手投降了。……
   归根到底说明了一件事：人心之向背是经常起作用的因素；在人民中孤立的一切反动派管你怎么横行霸道，终究是纸老虎。只要人民觉悟起来，组织起来，人民的敌人迟早会走上一条大体相同的道路：一触即溃，或不触即溃……
    藏族人民的心，向着谁？又背着谁？他们背着反动派，背着随时有挖眼睛、割鼻子、抽脚筋、五体分尸的危险；背着马费、料费、草费、垫子费、拉卜费以及其他巧立名目的敲诈勒索。他们向着共产党、向着毛主席、向着中央人民政府、向着人民解放军、向着走向自由幸福的康庄大道、向着社会主义祖国的团结和统一、向着娜觉玛的歌声！你知道娜觉玛的歌声吗？娜觉玛本是云南迪庆藏族自治州的奴女，早年丧夫，一生中曾在远方讨饭行乞，流浪过二十五次。云南解放了，这个奴女从此获得了新生，不再受人压榨了，再用不着四处流浪了，生活逐步改善了。心情舒畅，从而“永歌之”，“手之舞之足之蹈之”了。她唱着：
            “毛主席是纯金的太阳
            晒暖了藏民的心
            晒去了我脸上的皱纹
            我娜觉玛也成真正的青年人。”
    娜觉玛的道路是全体藏族人民的道路，也是西藏地区藏族人民的道路。她的歌声是全体藏族人民的歌声，也是西藏地区藏族人民的歌声，这歌声代表着时代发展的方向！
    皓日当天，光芒万丈，万物更新，欣欣向荣；平息叛乱，民主改革，西藏地区苏醒了。西藏地区藏族人民的心和全国各族人民的心紧紧地联结在一起。
    人心所向，大势所趋，藏族人民必然起来用自己的双手，而且果然用自己的双手粉碎奴隶的锁链！藏族人民前面的幸福之路，浩瀚无垠！
