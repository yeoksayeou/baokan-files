Xinhua News Agency, May 27th. Since the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued instructions in February this year on popularizing secondary and higher education among cadres, the cultural education work of cadres in the PLA has achieved remarkable results. Tens of thousands of cadres in the army with an educational level below senior primary school have completed senior primary and junior secondary school arithmetic, and tens of thousands of cadres have completed one or more secondary school courses. Hundreds of thousands of officers in the army have been organized into various teaching forms such as spare-time cultural remedial schools, cultural training courses, and self-study classes to carry out their studies. A cultural and educational army of more than 60,000 part-time and full-time teachers has organized a nationwide teaching network.

In cultural teaching, various methods such as individual self-study, running spare-time cultural remedial schools, and organizing short-term off-the-job training are adopted by various units. In addition, methods such as attending local night schools and running correspondence courses are used as supplements. For example, the Air Force Political Department and the Beijing Institute of Technology jointly run a higher professional correspondence school, with an attached night university. These practices have adapted to the complex needs of various types of troops and cadres due to different work tasks, making the teaching in various units suitable for local conditions, time, and people, and able to be large or small, concentrated or dispersed, and able to be a blitz or consolidated.

The vast number of cadres in the army have demonstrated a persevering and tenacious spirit in their studies, putting forward the slogan of "long-flowing water, continuous line, accumulation over time, and persistent perseverance."

Since being stationed on the front lines, a certain artillery unit of the Fujian Front has set up a cultural school in tents. The unit's leading cadres often personally call the roll in the classroom, and require cadres who go to the company to check on work to also attend classes, and those who miss classes must make up for them on time. Cadres who go home to visit relatives must bring homework, so most cadres have excellent academic performance. A certain flying unit of the People's Air Force scientifically arranges time under continuous flying conditions, so that pilots can persist in learning. Officers on a certain warship of the East Sea Fleet persist in cultural learning during arduous sea voyages, proposing: study in port, study at sea, and study whenever there is time. Many infantry units intersperse cultural classes during field training, resulting in a double harvest of military training and cultural education. Some construction units participating in national construction ensure the progress of cultural education while ensuring the completion of construction tasks. The methods they adopt are: study less in major construction sections and processes; study more in minor construction sections and processes; when working in shifts, study shift by shift. Many conscription cadres participate in local spare-time cultural schools, and some treat the work team as a study group when working in the countryside. Some units, whenever there are batches of people going out, organize classes before going out, designate special personnel to lead the study; some also send teachers to follow, teaching wherever they go. Some units adopt the method of two sessions of classes and self-study in the middle for scattered outgoing personnel, that is, a blitz before going out, completing homework during the outing, and giving time to make up lessons after returning to the team.

After the cultural education work of the vast number of cadres in the troops has been deepened step by step, it has played a significant role in improving the quality of troop training and consolidating military technology, as well as popularizing mass literary and artistic creation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 27th. In recent months, the Shanghai Garrison District of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has generally promoted the experience of small-scale cultural teaching classes, properly arranging the spare-time cultural learning of cadres, and achieving good results. In the past, the Shanghai Garrison District troops ran a number of cultural night schools or cultural remedial schools every year to organize cadres to study on the job. However, it was often impossible to persist from beginning to end. One of the important reasons is that the teaching methods and teaching organization forms are not adapted to the characteristics of on-the-job cadres who focus on work, have little time, and have high mobility. After the General Political Department's "Instructions on Popularizing Secondary Education and Higher Education among Cadres" was issued last year, many comrades put forward many suggestions on how to strengthen the organization and leadership of remedial schools and improve teaching methods. The more concentrated opinions were to reduce the size of the remedial school classes as much as possible so that the teaching organization is consistent with the administrative units. Open a small teaching class with a lean organization and concentrated courses.

This small cultural teaching class was first piloted in a certain organ of the Garrison District troops. This department divided people with a mathematics level below junior high school into an algebra class and a geometry class, taught by a comrade in the department who had just completed algebra and a graduate of a quick-success middle school, respectively, and the head of the department served as the class teacher. The leaders made unified arrangements for work and study based on daily work tasks and the learning requirements of the business departments. The leaders also formulated a learning system with everyone, stipulating that learning time should not be used for office work, meetings, or absenteeism without reason. If cadres go on a mission or go to the company as soldiers, they must also take their learning tasks with them. While arranging work tasks, the head of the department, together with the part-time teachers, explained the learning tasks to the students. For individuals going out alone, the teacher made key explanations and assigned homework questions; for those who went to the company to check work and those who went to the company as soldiers, they were required to study with the cadres of the company, and then make up for the review when they returned to the agency, ensuring that both work and study were not delayed. After a short period of experimentation with these methods, the cadres were very satisfied. The leaders summarized the experience in a timely manner and quickly promoted it throughout the district. Now, cadres below junior high school level in the entire district, except for individual departures from farther away or hospitalization due to illness and some conscription cadres, have all been organized to participate in cultural learning.

    采取多样形式因地因时因人制宜进行教学
    解放军干部文化学习步步深入
    对提高训练质量和巩固军事技术起了很大作用
    新华社27日讯  中国人民解放军部队的干部文化教育工作，自解放军总政治部在今年2月发布在干部中普及中等和高等教育的指示以后，已经获得了明显的成绩。全军有数万名高小程度以下的干部学完了高小和初中算术，数万名干部已学完了一门以上的中学课程。全军的数十万军官，已分别组织到业余文化补习学校、文化轮训班和自修班等多种教学形式中进行学习。一支有六万多名的兼职和专职教员的文教大军，把全军性的教学网组织起来了。
    各部队在文化教学方面，采取了个人自修、举办业余文化补习学校和组织短期离职轮训等多种方式。另外，还以进地方夜校、举办函授等方式，作为补充。如空军政治部和北京工业学院共同举办了高等专业函授学校，并附设夜大学。这一些作法，适应了各类部队和各类干部因为工作任务不同而产生的复杂需要，使各类部队在教学上做到了因地、因时、因人制宜，能大能小、能集中能分散，能突击能巩固。
    全军广大干部在学习上表现了坚毅顽强的精神，他们提出了“长流水，不断线，日积月累，坚持不懈”的口号。
    福建前线炮兵某部队自上阵地以后，便在帐篷中办起文化学校，部队的领导干部经常亲自到课堂里去点名，并要求下连队检查工作的干部也同时来听课，以及缺课的要按时补课、回家探亲的干部要带作业，因而大部分干部学习成绩优良。人民空军某飞行部队，在连续飞行的情况下，科学地安排时间，使飞行员坚持了学习。东海舰队某舰上的军官们，在艰苦的海上航行中坚持文化学习，他们提出：在港内学，出海也学，一有时间就学。许多步兵部队，在野营训练当中穿插上文化课，使得军事训练、文化教育双丰收。一些参加国家建设的施工部队，都在保证完成施工任务的情况下，保证了文化教育的进行。他们采取的办法是：在主要工段、工序中少学；在次要工段、工序中多学；分班作业时，就一班一班地学。不少兵役干部参加了地方业余文化学校，一些人下乡工作时，把工作组当成学习组。有的部队，凡有成批人员外出时，就在外出前编好班，指定专人领导学习；有的还派教员跟着去，走到那里教到那里。有的部队对零星外出人员，采取了两头上课、中间自学的方法，即外出前突击一下，外出期间完成作业，归队后给时间补课。
    部队广大干部的文化教育工作步步深入展开后，对提高部队训练质量和巩固军事技术以及普及群众性的文艺创作，都起了很大作用。
    新华社上海27日电  中国人民解放军上海警备区部队，近几月来普遍推行小型文化教学班的经验，妥善地安排干部的业余文化学习，收到了良好的效果。上海警备区部队过去每年都开办若干文化夜校或文化补习学校，组织干部在职学习。可是常常不能自始至终坚持下去。重要原因之一是教学方法、教学组织形式与在职干部以工作为主、时间少、流动性大的特点不相适应。去年总政“关于在干部中普及中等教育和高等教育的指示”下达以后，不少同志对如何加强补习学校的组织领导，改进教学方法等问题，提出了许多建议，比较集中的意见是要求把补习学校班次编小，使教学组织与行政单位尽可能相一致。开办一种组织精干、课程集中的小型教学班。
    这种小型文化教学班，首先在警备区部队某机关进行试办。这个部门把数学水平在初中以下的人，编成一个代数班和一个几何班，由本部门一个刚学完代数的同志和一个速成中学毕业的同志分别担任教员，部门首长担任班主任。领导上根据日常工作任务和业务部门的学习要求，将工作与学习统一作了安排。领导上还和大家一起制订了学习制度，规定学习时间不办公、不开会、不无故缺课。干部若出发、下连当兵，也要带着学习任务去。部门首长在布置工作任务的同时，与兼职教员一起，向学员交代学习任务。对单独外出人员，由教员作重点讲解、布置作业题；对下连队检查工作和下连当兵的人员要求他们随连队干部学习，回机关再作补课复习，保证工作学习两不误。这些办法经过短期试验，干部都很满意。领导上及时总结了这方面的经验并迅速在全区范围内普遍推行。现在全区初中程度以下的干部，除了个别出发较远或生病住院以及部分兵役干部外，其余都已组织起来，参加了文化学习。（附图片）
