    Xinhua News Agency report: People of all nationalities on the Inner Mongolian grasslands are now enthusiastically engaged in raising chickens, ducks, and geese. At present, various localities are vigorously transferring hatching eggs and carrying out spring incubation work. In the past two months or so, the number of poultry in many banners and counties has increased rapidly. The people's communes in Liangcheng County, Ulanqab League, have hatched more than 200,000 chickens, and the Huangqihai Duck Farm in Chahar Right Wing Front Banner has hatched more than 600,000 ducklings. Jining City has selected and purchased Leghorn, Australian Black, and Jiujin Yellow high-quality eggs from Shanghai, Beijing, and other places, and has hatched more than 10,000 chicks.
    Pastoral areas, which have never raised poultry, have become interested in eating eggs since raising a small number of poultry last year, so they have also begun to raise chickens and ducks in large numbers this year. On the Xilin Gol League grasslands, which are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, groups of chickens have recently appeared in the places where herdsmen live. Some communes have also established duck farms and rabbit farms. This league plans to raise 740,000 chickens this year.

    内蒙古草原鸡鸭鹅成群
    据新华社讯  内蒙古草原的各民族人民，现正兴致勃勃地忙着养鸡、养鸭、养鹅。目前，各地正大力调剂种蛋，进行春季孵育工作。最近两个多月来，许多旗县的家禽增加很快，乌兰察布盟凉城县各人民公社已孵育小鸡二十多万只，察哈尔右翼前旗黄旗海鸭场也孵出小鸭六十多万只，集宁市从上海、北京等地选购的来克亨、澳洲黑、九斤黄等良种鸡蛋，已孵出雏鸡一万多只。
    素来不饲养家禽的牧区，自从去年饲养少数家禽后，牧民们对吃鸡蛋产生了兴趣，所以今年也开始大量养鸡养鸭。以畜牧业为主的锡林郭勒盟草原上，在牧民定居的地方新近出现了一群群小鸡，有些公社还办起了养鸭场和养兔场。这个盟今年准备养鸡七十四万只。
