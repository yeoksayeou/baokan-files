    Guangzhou Seeks Raw Materials From Six Aspects
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, May 5th) Factories in Guangzhou have adopted six effective measures to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, ensuring the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan.
    Guangzhou's industrial production plan for this year has significant growth in both light and heavy industries. Therefore, the demand for raw materials has greatly increased. How to solve the supply of raw materials has become a key to realizing this year's Great Leap Forward. After discovering this problem, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately decided to address the raw materials issue as an important aspect of organizing the Great Leap Forward. Subsequently, a mass airing of views, full-scale debate, and big-character posters campaign was launched among cadres and workers to criticize the mentality of relying on external assistance and waiting for solutions, and to mobilize everyone to find ways to overcome the raw materials bottleneck.
    In the movement to mobilize the masses to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials, Guangzhou found six specific methods. These six methods are: 1. Clearing warehouses; 2. Using various forms to organize large-scale raw material collaboration; 3. Using substitutes to conserve raw materials; 4. Recycling waste products; 5. Establishing self-operated raw material industries; 6. Diversified operations. Among these, clearing warehouses, holding "Mule and Horse Exchange Conferences" (a form of collaboration), using substitutes, and recycling waste products have played a significant role in solving current production problems. The steel materials cleared from the warehouses alone were equivalent to about one-fifth of the steel allocated by higher authorities in the first quarter. In addition, a batch of mechanical equipment was cleared out, effectively supporting current production. For example, more than 70 electric motors, which were lacking in the production of six heavy industry factories such as Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant and Jiehe Iron and Steel Plant, were resolved through the city-wide steel clearing efforts. Through the "Mule and Horse Exchange Conferences" held separately by various districts and industrial bureaus, the vast majority of factories in the city contributed their surplus materials to support other factories and also obtained the materials they lacked from other factories. Jianguo and Nanfang Motor Factories manufactured dozens of motors, but they could not be shipped due to the lack of bearings. With the support of fraternal factories through the "Mule and Horse Exchange Conference," this batch of motors was quickly installed and shipped. Waste recycling stations, which are located in various streets, agencies, and schools throughout the city, provided valuable raw materials for various factories and enterprises. The Zhongqu Hardware Factory used scrap steel to make more than 10,000 dozen locks needed by the market; the Zhiqun Motor Factory used black iron sheets, round steel, antimony, etc., picked from waste products to make 40 electric motors. Factories have also made great efforts in technical revolution and used substitutes to conserve raw materials, achieving great results. Workers at Jianguo and other motor factories found ways to improve the design of their products, removing the outer shell of closed-type motors and changing them to open-magnetic-field type, which can save about two-thirds of the iron while maintaining the same quality. The glass industry factories under the Light Industry Bureau proposed the innovative suggestion of changing semi-gas generators to full-gas generators in the case of a shortage of bituminous coal. Now, not only can white coal be burned, but also 30% of coal is saved, and the quality is also very good.
    Focusing on both short-term and long-term needs is a major characteristic of Guangzhou's solution to the raw materials problem this year. In addition to using the above methods to solve the raw materials needed for current production, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various factories also adopted methods such as establishing self-operated raw material industries, helping rural areas develop raw material bases, and establishing permanent "supply and sales homes" for regular exchange of raw materials within industries, to solve the longer-term supply of raw materials. At present, many large, medium, and small factories throughout the city have adopted indigenous methods and comprehensive utilization methods to manufacture raw materials themselves. In March, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially organized rural visiting groups to go to Hainan, Zhanjiang, Shaoguan, Shantou, and Jiangmen to understand the situation and provide technical and equipment assistance to rural communes in establishing and developing raw material industries. In addition, hundreds of factories throughout the city have established "supply and sales homes" by industry to make the exchange of raw materials between factories in the same industry a regular practice.
    After adopting these measures, a new situation has emerged in production. The output value in February increased by 8%, and in March it increased by another 9%. (Zhao Yingcai)

　　既抓增产又抓节约  加强协作产销一家
    广州从六个方面寻找原材料
    本报广州5日电　广州市各工厂，采取六项有效措施解决原材料不足的困难，保证了跃进计划的实现。
    广州市今年的工业生产规划，轻重工业都有很大的增长。因此对原材料的需要就大大增加了。如何解决原材料的供应问题，就成为实现今年跃进的一个关键。中共广州市委发现了这个问题后，当即确定以解决原材料问题作为组织跃进的一个重要方面。接着就在广大干部和工人中展开了大鸣大放大辩论，批判伸手、等待思想，发动大家想办法攻破材料关。
    广州市在发动群众解决原材料不足的运动中找到了六项具体办法。这六项办法是：一、清理仓库；二、利用多种形式组织原材料大协作；三、利用代用品节约原材料；四、回收废品；五、自办原材料工业；六、多种经营。其中清仓、召开“骡马交流大会”（协作的一种形式）、利用代用品和回收废品等方法，对解决当前生产上的问题起到了很大作用。仅在钢铁清仓中，清出的钢材就相当于第一季度上级分配钢材的五分之一左右。此外，还清出一批机械设备，有效地支援了当前生产。如广州钢铁厂、捷和钢铁厂等六个重工业厂，生产中缺少的七十多台电动机，就是在全市钢铁清仓中得到解决的。通过各区和各工业局分别召开的“骡马交流大会”，全市绝大多数工厂都拿出了本厂多余的物资支援别厂，也从别厂拿到了本厂所缺乏的材料。建国和南方电机厂制造了好几十台马达，但都因缺轴承而无法出厂，通过“骡马交流大会”，在兄弟厂的支援下，这批马达很快就安装好出厂了。遍布全市各街道、机关、学校的废品收购站为各工厂企业提供了宝贵的原材料。中区五金厂用废钢材制成了一万多打市场需要的锁；志群电机厂用废品中拣出的黑铁皮、圆钢、锑等制成了四十台电动机。各工厂大搞技术革命，利用代用品来节约原材料也取得了很大的效果。建国等电机厂的职工想办法改进了产品的设计，把封闭式马达的外壳去掉，改为露磁式的，可节约铁三分之二左右，使用质量相同。轻工业局的玻璃行业工厂，在烟煤缺乏的情况下，提出把半煤气发生炉改为全煤气炉的革新建议，现在不仅可以用白煤燃烧，而且节约了30％的煤，质量也很好。
    远近兼施是今年广州市解决原材料问题的一大特色。除了用上述办法解决当前生产上所需的原材料外，中共广州市委和各工厂还采用自办原材料工业、帮助农村发展原材料基地和按行业建立了经常性互通原材料有无的“供销之家”等办法，来解决较长远的原材料供应。目前全市已有许多大中小型工厂采取土法上马、综合利用的办法自造原材料。中共广州市委在3月间专门组织了农村访问团。分赴海南、湛江、韶关、汕头和江门等地，一方面了解情况，一方面从技术上和设备上帮助农村公社建立和发展原材料工业。此外，全市还有几百家工厂按行业成立了“供销之家”，使同行业各厂之间的原材料互通有无工作能够经常化。
    采用上述这些措施以后，生产上出现了新的局面。2月份产值提高了8％，3月份又提高了9％。　（赵颖采）
