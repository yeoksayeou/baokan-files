Comrade Chairman, esteemed delegates, esteemed committee members:

I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. This report allows us to further profoundly understand the great significance of the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, on all fronts. In terms of international relations, the achievements of our country's peaceful foreign policy are also very significant. As far as foreign cultural work is concerned, as of now, our country has established and developed cultural exchange relations with 104 countries and regions, and our friends are all over the world.

Under the principle of consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we have carried out extensive and in-depth cultural exchanges with fraternal countries, supporting and learning from each other. This is of great importance and plays a huge role in enriching the cultural lives of the people of socialist countries, promoting the common upsurge of cultural undertakings in socialist countries, especially for our country to learn from the advanced culture, science, and construction experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and promoting our great socialist construction cause.

Our cultural exchanges with nationalist countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are conducted on a friendly basis. The Chinese people have always held sincere concern and respect for the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, for national independence, and for the defense of world peace, and have always given deep sympathy and warm support. In order to express the friendship of the Chinese people, Chinese cultural and art groups have been invited to visit many countries in these regions, and have been warmly welcomed by the government leaders and the broad masses of the people of these countries wherever they go. Especially in the past year, the visits of Chinese cultural and art groups to Cambodia, Ceylon, Afghanistan, Iraq, the United Arab Republic, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile have been met with friendly receptions and warm welcomes. At the same time, China has also received many cultural and art groups and famous figures from the cultural circles of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Chinese people and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have suffered the same fate and experienced the suffering and misfortune brought about by imperialists and colonialists. Therefore, the Chinese people and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, no matter whether they have stood up, got rid of imperialist control, and gained independence, or are still fighting heroically against imperialism for national independence and people's freedom, and no matter how far away they are from China geographically, their hearts are connected and their interests are closely related. The Chinese people and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must unite and cooperate, support and support each other in the movement to safeguard and strive for national independence, in the struggle against colonialism, and in the great cause of building their own countries according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. This is in line with the common interests of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and also reflects the common demands of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Therefore, our work has received the deep sympathy and assistance of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and has been warmly welcomed and supported by the people of these regions. We believe that this friendship will continue to be strengthened and developed with the awakening of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the upsurge of the national independence movement.

With regard to Western countries, we have carried out friendly exchanges and cultural ties with them in accordance with our country's peaceful foreign policy and the principle that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully and compete peacefully. The development of this cultural relationship is undoubtedly beneficial and necessary for enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Western countries (including the American people). Therefore, our cultural exchange work with Western capitalist countries has also made progress year by year.

In order to promote international cultural exchanges, we have established eighteen foreign friendship associations. There are as many as forty-six corresponding organizations established for me in foreign countries. These organizations are distributed in thirty-six countries. We have also seen important developments in the mutual dispatch of international students, the mutual exchange of cultural materials and books and magazines, translation and publication, the mutual screening of films, the mutual exhibition of exhibitions, as well as the commemoration of world cultural celebrities, participation in international academic organizations, and international academic conferences. The new face of our country after liberation, the new achievements in socialist construction, and the hard work of our people in peaceful construction have been well received by the people of various countries. Our people's support for the heroic struggles of the people of all countries against imperialism and colonialism has consolidated the friendship with them. Our people's lofty cause of safeguarding world peace and progress has gradually gained a deep understanding from the people of all countries and has been given deep sympathy and support. The Chinese people's call for peace, friendship, and justice often resounds in every corner of the world. This makes us more confident and encouraged in our work.

However, this is not to say that our work has no difficulties or will not encounter any sabotage and obstruction. Imperialist colonial forces will not automatically withdraw from the historical stage. In particular, the most ferocious enemy of the world's people, the U.S. imperialists, do not want to see our people's independence, liberation, and great construction achievements. They are doing everything possible to undermine our cause, occupy our territory of Taiwan, and continue to step up the conspiracy to create "two Chinas". The socialist forces headed by the Soviet Union and the increasingly powerful forces for peace have made U.S. imperialism extremely panic-stricken, and it is trying to use its dying struggle to reverse its doom. In addition to stepping up the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, piecing together military blocs, and instigating military coups and organizing subversion activities in nationalist countries, it is also painstakingly spreading discord and sowing dissension between Asian and African countries, between nationalist countries and the socialist camp. Imperialism has recently taken advantage of our country's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion to clamor wildly, attempting to stir up a reactionary countercurrent against China. Naturally, its conspiratorial activities, like all past conspiratorial efforts, are doomed to failure. People of justice all over the world have expressed warm support for our people's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and the safeguarding of the unity of the motherland and national unity, and have expressed indignation and condemnation of the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and all foreign reactionaries to split Tibet from China. But regrettably, some people in friendly countries, here referring to the expansionists of India and certain Indian politicians, are catering to the conspiracies of imperialism, inheriting the mantle of British imperialism, supporting the rebellion of Tibetan reactionaries, and blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs, indicating that they harbor ambitious ambitions for China's territory. These conspiratorial activities not only undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and non-interference in each other's internal affairs jointly advocated by China and India, and damage the deep friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples with a tradition of two thousand years, but will also equally ruin the reputation that India has won in international affairs over the years and weaken the solidarity of the people of Asian and African countries. But we believe that far-sighted politicians and enlightened people in various countries and India, as long as they have sufficient reason to correctly estimate the wishes and demands of their own people, and at the same time correctly understand the road to human peace, justice, and bright progress, they will not venture into the trap set by imperialists and colonialists. In the common struggle against the imperialist policy of aggression and the policy of war, and in the common efforts to initiate, launch, and safeguard the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, the Chinese people have extensively established deep friendship with the people of all countries, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is a friendship established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which is in line with the interests and demands of the people of all countries, and therefore can stand the test. Any conspiracy and sabotage by imperialists and a handful of revisionists and other reactionaries they hire will inevitably be shamefully defeated. The friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between our people and the people of all countries will inevitably continue to increase and continue to be strengthened. At present, the leaping progress of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, which are the bulwark of human peace and the pillar of cultural progress, the great achievements of our country's construction, and the ardent desire of our people to develop international friendly cooperation, the upsurge of nationalism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the growth of the forces for peace among the people of the world, have made the work of our country in carrying out peaceful, friendly, and cultural exchanges with the people of all countries more favorable and solid. Therefore, when we look back on our country's foreign cultural friendship work in recent years and look forward to its development prospects, we are even more full of infinite confidence and unparalleled courage. We will hold even higher the banner of peace, friendship, and cultural progress and stride forward towards a victorious, hopeful, and bright future!

    不许印度反动派破坏五项原则
    楚图南委员的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告。这个报告使我们进一步深刻地体会到，我们中国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在各个战线上取得的辉煌的成就的伟大意义。在国际关系方面，我国的和平外交政策所取得的成就也是很显著的。就对外文化工作来说，截至现在止，我国和一百零四个国家和地区建立和发展了文化交往的关系，我们的朋友遍于天下。
    我们在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结的方针下，同各兄弟国家进行了广泛深入的文化交流，相互支持，相互学习，这对于丰富社会主义各国人民的文化生活，促进社会主义各国的文化事业的共同高涨，特别是对于我国学习苏联和其他社会主义国家的先进的文化科学和建设经验，推进我国伟大的社会主义建设事业，是有着十分重要的意义和巨大的作用的。
    我们同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲地区的民族主义国家的文化交往，是在友好的基础上进行的。中国人民对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取、维护民族独立和保卫世界和平的斗争，从来就怀着衷心的关怀和敬意，并且一向给予深切的同情和热烈的支持。为了表达中国人民的友谊，中国的文化、艺术团体曾经应邀访问了这些地区的许多国家，每到一个国家都无不受到这些国家的政府领导人和广大人民的热烈欢迎。特别在最近一年以来，中国的文化、艺术团体在柬埔寨、锡兰、阿富汗、伊拉克、阿联、黎巴嫩、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳、阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭和智利的访问，受到了友好的接待和热烈的欢迎。同时，中国也接待了不少来自亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的文化、艺术团体和文化界的著名人士。中国人民同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民遭受过相同的命运，经历了帝国主义和殖民主义者所带来的苦难和不幸，因此，中国人民同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民，不论他们是已经站立了起来，摆脱了帝国主义的控制和获得了独立，或者还在为着民族独立、人民自由同帝国主义进行着英勇斗争，也不论地理上同中国距离的远近，他们的心是相连的，利益是休戚相关的。中国人民同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民必须在维护和争取民族独立运动中，在反殖民主义的斗争中，在建设自己的祖国的伟大事业中，根据和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的精神互相团结和合作、互相声援和支持。这是符合亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的共同利益的，也反映了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的共同的要求。所以我们的工作得到了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的深厚的同情和协助，受到了这些地区的各国人民的热烈的欢迎和支持。我们相信这种友谊将随着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的觉醒和民族独立运动的高涨而不断地加强，不断地发展。
    对于西方国家，我们根据我国的和平外交政策和根据不同政治制度可以和平共处和和平竞赛的原则，同他们开展了友好往来和文化联系。这种文化关系的发展对增进中国人民和西方各国人民（包括美国人民在内）的相互了解和友谊，无疑是有益的，必需的。因此，我们对西方资本主义国家的文化交往工作也逐年有所进展。
    为了相互推动国际间的文化交往，我们已成立了十八个对外友好协会。外国对我成立的相应的组织也有四十六个之多，这些组织分布在三十六个国家。我们同各国之间留学生的相互派遣、文化资料和书刊杂志的相互交换、翻译和出版，电影的相互放映，展览会的相互展出，以及纪念世界文化名人，参加国际学术组织和国际学术会议等多种多样的活动，也有了重要的发展。我国解放后的新面貌，社会主义建设的新成就，我国人民在和平建设中的辛勤劳动，已经在各国人民中得到良好的反应。我国人民对各国人民的反对帝国主义反对殖民主义的英勇斗争的支持，巩固了同他们之间的友谊。我国人民的维护世界和平、进步的崇高事业，已使各国人民逐渐有了深刻的认识和给予了深厚的同情和支持。中国人民的和平、友好和正义的呼声经常地响彻世界的每一角落。这使我们对于我们的工作更充满了信心，更得到了鼓舞。
    但是，这也不是说，我们的工作没有丝毫的困难，不会遇到任何的破坏和阻挠。帝国主义殖民势力是不会自动退出历史舞台的。特别是世界人民的最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义者，他不愿看到我国人民的独立、解放，和伟大的建设成就，他正在千方百计地破坏我们的事业，霸占了我国的领土台湾，并在继续加紧制造“两个中国”的阴谋。以苏联为首的社会主义力量、越来越强大的和平力量，使美帝国主义极端惶恐不安，它企图用垂死的挣扎来挽回它的厄运。除了加紧复活西德和日本的军国主义，拼凑军事集团，对民族主义国家策动军事政变和组织颠复活动外，更处心积虑地在亚、非各国之间、民族主义国家和社会主义阵营之间散布不和，挑拨离间。帝国主义最近利用我国平定西藏叛乱，大肆叫嚣，企图掀起一个反对中国的反动逆流。自然它的这种阴谋活动也和过去的种种阴谋努力一样，注定是要失败的。全世界主持正义的人民对我国人民平定西藏叛乱，维护祖国的统一和民族团结，都表示热烈的支持，对美帝国主义和一切外国反动派，企图把西藏从中国分裂出去的阴谋都表示了愤慨和谴责。但是遗憾的是有的友好国家的人，这里指的是印度的扩张主义分子和某些印度政治家，却迎合着帝国主义的阴谋，承继着英帝国主义的衣钵，支持西藏反动分子的叛乱，露骨地干涉中国的内政，说明他们对中国的领土存有勃勃的野心。他们的这些阴谋勾当不仅破坏了中印两国所共同倡议的和平共处、互不干涉内政的五项原则，损害有着两千年传统的中印两国人民的深厚友谊，也同样的会败坏了印度这些年来在国际事务中所赢得的声誉和削弱了亚非各国人民的团结。但我们相信各国和印度的有远见的政治家和社会上的开明人士，只要他们有着足够的理智，能够正确地估计到本国人民的意愿和要求，同时也正确地认识人类和平正义和光明进步的大道，他们必不会冒险走向帝国主义和殖民主义者所设下的陷阱。我们中国人民在反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的共同斗争中，在倡议发起和维护和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的共同努力中，曾经和各国人民，特别是和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民广泛地建立了深厚的友谊。这是在平等互利的基础上建立起来的友谊，它符合各国人民的利益和要求，因此是经得起考验的。任何帝国主义者及其所雇用的一小撮修正主义分子和其他反动分子的阴谋破坏，必然遭到可耻的失败。我国人民和各国人民的友好来往和文化交流必然会不断地增进和不断地加强。在当前作为人类和平堡垒和文化进步的支柱的以苏联为首的社会主义各国的飞跃进步，我国建设的伟大成就和我国人民发展国际友好合作的殷切愿望，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲民族主义的高涨和世界各国人民和平力量的壮大，使我国同各国人民进行和平友好和文化交流的工作更有了十分有利的条件和坚实巩固的基础。因此，当我们回顾近年来我国的对外文化友好工作，展望它的发展前途的时候，我们更充满了无限的信心和无比的勇气。我们将更高地举起和平、友好和文化进步的旗帜向着胜利、希望和光明的前途大踏步地前进！
