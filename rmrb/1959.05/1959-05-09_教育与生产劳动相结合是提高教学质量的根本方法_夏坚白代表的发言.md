Comrades,

I completely and sincerely support Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report and the reports of the leading comrades, and I will resolutely follow Premier Zhou’s instructions, absolutely listen to the Party, and use active actions to complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to me by the Party in 1959 to welcome the tenth anniversary of our great motherland – the People’s Republic of China.

The all-round Great Leap Forward of 1958 gave us bourgeois intellectuals the most profound education. After the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the education revolution movement, we affirmed the absolute leadership of the Party, clarified that education should serve proletarian politics, and deeply recognized that education must be combined with productive labor.

I am an educator engaged in surveying and mapping science and technology. Now, I would like to talk about a few points of personal experience regarding the implementation of the Party's education policy at Wuhan Technical College of Surveying and Mapping. Please criticize and correct any inaccuracies.

In order to turn the Great Northern Wilderness into a Great Granary, teachers and students overcame numerous difficulties and completed the surveying task of the heavy swamp area of the Great Northern Wilderness, which was originally scheduled to take two years, in just three months.

I. Party leadership and putting politics in command are the main guarantees for doing all work well. Here, I would like to illustrate this with an example. In the spring of 1958, in order to realize the great plan of the Party Central Committee to "open up an England" in the Heilongjiang Great Northern Wilderness during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the Wasteland Survey and Design Institute of the Central Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation commissioned our college to survey all the heavy swamp areas of the Great Northern Wilderness, an area of approximately 13,500 square kilometers, and produce 178 topographic maps at a scale of 1:25,000 between June and September 1958. Just as the college Party committee was considering this issue, the news spread to every corner of the college. Consequently, students from various departments and classes, along with some young teachers, beat drums and gongs to compete in sending big-character posters to the Party committee, requesting that this glorious and arduous task be entrusted to them, and guaranteeing that they would complete the task on schedule so that cultivation could begin in 1959. They knew that the survey area in the Great Northern Wilderness was connected with primeval forests and primeval shrub forests, and rivers and large floating raft meadows ran through it. A small portion of the flatter areas were grasslands, and the area was uninhabited, without any transportation routes. Boats and vehicles could not pass through at all, and there were many wild animals, with dense swarms of mosquitoes, gadflies, gnats, and ticks. The conditions were particularly harsh. However, they said, "The Red Army marched 25,000 li, and we only have to march 403 li (the survey area is about 400 li long). What's so difficult about that?" At the same time, they put forward the heroic slogan: "Turn the Great Northern Wilderness into a Great Granary" and "Fight for 45 billion catties of grain."

In this way, our college organized 266 teachers and students to participate in this difficult and glorious surveying and mapping work, mainly responsible for the overall technical work. In addition, there were 633 demobilized PLA officers and soldiers as surveyors, and 162 members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Land Management Bureau Surveying Team responsible for administrative work. A total of 1,061 people temporarily formed the Great Northern Wilderness Surveying Corps, and under the personal leadership of the directors of the Wasteland Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, they entered the Great Northern Wilderness of Heilongjiang.

After entering the survey area, the special difficulties of the natural conditions brought many unexpected difficulties to life and work. However, because they were ideologically clear about the significance of developing the Great Northern Wilderness for socialist construction, they ultimately overcame one difficulty after another, and the work continued to leap forward. For example, when a certain detachment advanced and encountered the Biera Hong River, the river was connected to large floating raft meadows, five li wide, and about two meters deep. There were no tools to cross the river, and crossing the river was very difficult and dangerous. In order to save time, the students put forward the slogan: "The Red Army seized the Dadu River, and we will seize the Biera Hong River." They brought into play the collective wisdom and strength, cut down trees on the spot to make wooden rafts, put instruments and food on the rafts, and people pushed them across the water. Thus, more than 150 people jumped and crossed the Biera Hong River! The invasion of mosquitoes and gadflies was significant in life. When mosquitoes bit the students' faces, blood flowed, but in order to maintain the accuracy of the surveying observations, they did not use their hands to swat them, and they ridiculed themselves, saying, "Mosquitoes and gadflies are here to scratch my itch." They often camped in the open in the wild. When strong winds and rain came, they held hands and danced and sang. When they got lost and did not have time to return to the team, in order to avoid the attack of mosquitoes and wild animals, they climbed to the forks of tall trees more than 20 meters high, tied their bodies with ropes, and slept soundly all night. They called it "International Hotel." After each meal was made, it turned black (because it was made with marsh humus water), and there were piles of mosquitoes, flies, and gadflies in the rice. Everyone called it "diced meat fried rice." The water in ordinary grasslands was generally waist-deep, so the lower body was always soaked in water all day long. As a result, some people's bodies swelled, and even some places cracked and bled. However, in order to rush the task, fearing that others would not let them work, they secretly covered the wounds with clothes, and then rushed forward carrying heavy instruments on their backs.

This courage to despise all difficulties, revolutionary optimism, and selfless communist style for all the needs of the people is truly moving! As the old folks in the Northeast reflected: "Only with Chairman Mao can we have you little tigers, and the Great Northern Wilderness, which has been sleeping for thousands of years, can also change its appearance."

Through the intense and arduous labor of more than 1,000 members of the surveying corps for more than three months, they achieved great and brilliant results. In general, this achievement embodies the spirit of the Party's general line of more, faster, better, and more economical. They completed a 1:25,000 aerial photogrammetry map on average every fifteen days, creating a record for surveying and mapping heavy swamp areas internationally.

Launching a large-scale surveying campaign in the heavy swamp area of the Great Northern Wilderness is also a pioneering undertaking in Chinese history. In a short period of more than three months, under very unfavorable geographical conditions and extremely difficult material conditions, they were able to overcome numerous difficulties and finally successfully complete the major and arduous task originally scheduled to take two years, and also achieved new records in the speed of mapping under the premise of ensuring quality. This is entirely due to the correct leadership of the Party; everyone putting politics in command; and the masses actively bringing into play collective wisdom and soaring energy.

Experience has proven that only by actively participating in productive labor can we improve teaching quality and enrich teaching content. There is not only no contradiction between them, but they complement each other.

II. The combination of education and productive labor has improved teaching quality and cultivated students' ability to work independently. In the past, because many teachers had long been divorced from production and reality, teaching was mostly focused on theoretical knowledge in books, and was not closely linked to China's current great socialist construction cause. Therefore, the cadres trained often could not work independently when they went to production posts, and had to go through a relatively long period before they could skillfully complete their tasks. Why are many teachers divorced from production and reality? This is caused by superstition of books, superstition of experts, and the love of putting on the airs of the bourgeoisie. Belittling the present in favor of the past; putting on airs and not going down to the laboratory; loving face and not being willing to ask the able for advice, they are completely unfamiliar with new instruments, so they dare not enter the laboratory, fearing to make a "fool of themselves" in front of young teachers and students. After the education revolution movement, the above situation was fundamentally changed. Young and old teachers and students work together in the laboratory and participate in professional productive labor together. From here, everyone has accumulated a certain amount of production experience and discovered many shortcomings in the past teaching content and teaching methods. Therefore, the Party committee, teachers, and students jointly compiled new teaching materials and engaged in the improvement of teaching methods. In the past, after several years of compiling teaching materials, because a few people were engaged in it behind closed doors, there was no achievement so far; now, because young and old teachers and students collectively do it under the leadership of the Party committee, they have initially compiled more than ten kinds in just a few months, and can complete more than sixty kinds before this year's "July 1st." Such a large amount of teaching material compilation work was impossible in the past. Only after implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, can the vast number of teachers and students break superstitions and liberate their minds. The characteristic of the new teaching materials is that they are closely combined with the actual needs of China's socialist construction. For example, in engineering construction surveying, the methods and technologies of engineering surveying work of China's Yangtze River Bridge, Qinling Tunnel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Sanmenxia, and other projects are systematically introduced. Secondly, it also absorbs the experience accumulated by our college in education combined with production and the scientific research achievements of teachers and students, and adds new content, such as blast furnace installation measurement, high-voltage transmission line measurement, etc. In aerial photogrammetry, the measurement experience of the heavy swamp area of the Great Northern Wilderness (photo interpretation and comprehensive mapping) is added. These all show that only by actively participating in production work can we improve teaching quality and enrich teaching content. There is not only no contradiction between them, but they complement each other. In addition, through production practice, students' ability to use theory to solve practical problems has been exercised. For example, when students were measuring at the Hubei Steel Plant, when they were installing the metal cylindrical shell of the blast furnace system, they derived a relatively simple formula for calculating eccentricity differences based on practical experience, which was later widely used in the installation projects of the Yangzi Steel Plant and the Hanyang Steel Plant, proving that this method is very convenient and plays a certain role in improving the installation speed of the blast furnace of the steel plant. When mapping in the Great Northern Wilderness, in the case of very few obvious feature points, they explored some methods of interpretation in special areas. These methods did not come from books, and the teachers also did not know them at all, but were obtained by students through independent thinking based on practical experience. From this, the students deeply realized that theory must be closely combined with practice to show the vitality of theory, and at the same time, the understanding of theory can only be more profound through practice.

The combination of education and productive labor, mobilizing the masses, breaking superstitions, and changing the bleak situation of scientific research

III. After the combination of education and productive labor, the development of scientific research can be accelerated. In the past, bourgeois intellectuals believed that only experts could conduct scientific research, and the field of scientific research was narrow and very difficult to enter. Therefore, the scientific research atmosphere in the college was always bleak. After this large-scale education combined with productive labor, the superstitions of the masses were broken, and they saw with their own eyes that the field of scientific research is infinitely broad, and everyone can march toward scientific research. In production practice, new problems in science and technology that urgently need to be solved can be found everywhere. Therefore, hundreds of research topics were collected in a few months, and a booming scene was formed. In the past, when our college held an academic discussion meeting every year, there were only a dozen reports from the five departments of the college; now, each department is holding its own academic discussion meeting or teaching method discussion meeting, and the content of each meeting is far richer than the previous college-wide discussion meeting.

Not only that, but also because they have liberated their minds and broken superstitions, teachers and students are also attacking the cutting-edge technology in surveying and mapping science. With the cooperation of teachers and students, a medium-sized optical velocity rangefinder has been initially trial-produced; a junior student of the Department of Astronomical and Geodetic Surveying has trial-produced a current network adjustment instrument, which can solve some adjustment problems and ensure the correctness of three digits; some teachers from the Physics and Geodesy Teaching and Research Group and some junior students from the Department of Astronomical and Geodetic Surveying are also preparing to complete the trial production of a microwave rangefinder this year. In the past, these cutting-edge technologies were not dared to be thought of or touched. Now, not only are they daring to propose to study these problems, but some have already achieved preliminary results. These facts illustrate a truth: through education combined with productive labor, mobilizing the masses, and breaking superstitions, we can find the correct road for scientific research, and we can accelerate the development of scientific research and technological revolution.

In short, in the year of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the ideological situation, teaching quality, and scientific research direction in colleges and universities, like other aspects, have undergone major changes, and it can also be said that they have undergone essential changes! Today's colleges and universities are developing along the new direction pointed out by the Party. However, there is still a considerable distance from the goal required by the Party to make the development of cultural and educational work adapt to the needs of the entire socialist construction. Therefore, I am determined to strengthen self-reform in work practice and strive to improve my level in all aspects. I believe that only in this way can I be with the broad masses of the people and contribute a tiny force to the socialist cause.

### 教育与生产劳动相结合是提高教学质量的根本方法  夏坚白代表的发言

　　教育与生产劳动相结合是提高教学质量的根本方法
    夏坚白代表的发言各位代表：
    周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告，我都完全衷心地拥护，并且坚决遵照周总理的指示，绝对听党的话，用完成和超额完成党交给本人的一九五九年任务的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年。
    一九五八年的全面大跃进，给我们资产阶级知识分子以最深刻的教育。经过整风、反右和教育革命运动以后，我们肯定了党的绝对领导，明确了教育应该为无产阶级政治服务，深刻地认识到教育必须与生产劳动相结合。
    我是一个搞测绘科学技术的教育工作者，现在就本人在武汉测绘学院所亲自感到的关于贯彻党的教育方针方面的几点体会来谈一谈，不正确的地方，请各位代表批评指正。
    为了把北大荒变成北大仓，教师和学生，克服了重重困难，用三个月的时间完成了预定要两年才能完成的北大荒重沼泽区的测量任务
    一、党的领导和政治挂帅是搞好一切工作的主要保证。这里，我想用一个例子来说明。一九五八年春季，中央农垦部荒地勘察设计院，为了要实现党中央在第二个五年计划期内，在黑龙江北大荒境内“开出一个英国来”的伟大计划，委托我们学院在一九五八年六月到九月间，为他们测量北大荒的全部重沼泽地区，面积约一万三千五百平方公里、比例尺为一比两万五千的地形图一百七十八幅。正当我们学院党委考虑这个问题时，消息就传遍了学院的各个角落，于是全院的各系各班同学和部分青年教师都敲锣打鼓地竞向党委争送大字报，要求把这个光荣而艰巨的任务交给他们，并且保证一定如期完成任务，使垦植可以在一九五九年开始。他们知道北大荒这个测区是原始森林与原始灌木林相连，河流与大的飘筏甸子贯穿其中，少部分较平坦地区则是草原地带，地区内荒无人烟，没有任何交通路线，舟车根本不能通行，而且野兽很多，蚊、虻、小咬、草爬子密麻成群，条件特别艰苦。但是他们说，“红军长征二万五，我们只征四百三（测区长约为四百余华里），算什么艰难。”同时提出了英雄豪迈的口号：“变北大荒为北大仓”，“为四百五十亿斤粮食而斗争”。
    这样，我们学院就组织了二百六十六位师生参加了这艰难而光荣的勘测工作，主要负责全面的技术工作，另外有转业解放军官兵六百三十三名为测工，黑龙江省土管局勘测队一百六十二名负责行政工作，总共一千零六十一人临时组成了北大荒测量总队，在农垦部荒地勘察设计院院长们亲自领导下，进入了黑龙江的北大荒。
    进入测区后，由于自然条件的特殊困难，给生活上和工作上带来了许多意想不到的困难，但是由于思想上已经明确开发北大荒对于建设社会主义的意义，终究胜利地克服了一个个困难，而且工作还不断的跃进。例如某一分队进军遇到一条别拉洪河，河与大的飘筏甸子相连，宽五华里，水深约两公尺左右，没有渡河的工具，而且过河很困难，情况也很危险，同学们为了抢时间，提出了这样的口号：“红军抢渡大渡河，我们抢渡别拉洪河。”他们发挥了集体的智慧和力量，就地砍树作木排，把仪器和粮食放在木排上面，而人则在水中推着横渡，于是一百五十余人一跃而渡过了别拉洪河！在生活上蚊虻的侵害是很大的，蚊子咬在同学们的脸上，鲜血直流，他们为了保持测量的观测精度，就不用手去打它们，并且嘲笑着说：“蚊子、牛虻又来给我抓痒了”。出工经常在野外打露宿，来了狂风暴雨就手拉着手跳舞唱歌。迷失了方向而来不及回队时，为了避免蚊虫野兽的袭扰，他们就爬到二十多公尺高的大树杈，用绳子捆着自己的身躯，彻夜甜睡，他们叫它做：“国际饭店”。每顿饭作出后就成黑色（因用沼泽腐质水），饭里蚊、蝇、牛虻成堆，大家叫它做“肉丁炒饭”。普通草地一般水深齐腰，所以下半身总是整天泡在水里，有的人因此身上就肿胀，甚至有的地方裂口出血，但是他们为了抢任务，怕别人不让他们工作，背着人暗暗地用衣服遮着伤处，然后抢背上沈重的仪器而前进。
    这种藐视一切困难的勇气，革命的乐观主义，和一切为了人民的需要而忘我的共产主义风格，真使人感动！正如东北老乡们的反映：“有了毛主席才能有你们这些小老虎，千年沉睡的北大荒也能面貌改观。”
    通过测量总队一千余人员三个多月的紧张而又艰苦的劳动，获得了巨大的辉煌的成绩，这个成绩总的来说，是体现了党的多、快、好、省总路线的精神。平均十五天测完一幅一比两万五千航测综合法图，创造了国际上勘测重沼泽地区的记录。
    向北大荒重沼泽地区展开大规模的测量进军，在我国历史上还是创举。在短短的三个多月内，在地理条件非常不利和物质条件极其困难的情况下，能够克服重重困难，终于胜利地完成了原定二年才能完成的重大而艰巨的任务，而且在保证质量的前提下，还在测图速度方面，取得了新的记录。这是完全由于党的正确领导；人人政治挂帅；群众积极地发挥了集体的智慧和冲天的干劲。
  经验证明，只有积极参加生产劳动，才能提高教学质量，丰富教学内容，它们之间不但没有矛盾，而且相得益彰
    二、教育与生产劳动相结合，提高了教学质量并培养了同学们的独立工作能力。过去由于许多教师长期脱离生产，脱离实际，教学大都是偏重于书本上的理论知识，没有与我国当前伟大的社会主义建设事业取得密切的联系，因此培养出来的干部，走到生产岗位上常常不能独立工作，必须经过一个较长的时期，才能熟练地完成任务。许多教师为什么会脱离生产和实际？这是由于迷信书本，迷信专家，爱摆资产阶级的面子和架子所造成的。厚古就薄今；摆架子就不下实验室；爱面子而不肯向能者请教，对新仪器就根本陌生，因此就愈不敢进实验室，深怕在青年教师和学生们面前出“洋相”。经过教育革命运动以后，根本改变了上述的情况。青老年教师和学生们一起在实验室里工作，一同参加专业生产劳动。从这里大家都积累了一定的生产经验，并发现了过去教学内容和教学方法上的许多缺点。于是由党委、教师、学生三结合编写新教材，并从事教学法的改进。从前闹了几年编写教材，由于少数人关起门来搞，所以至今毫无成就；现在由于青老年教师和同学们在党委领导下集体动手，在短短的几个月里，已经初步编写完成十余种，在今年“七一”以前可以完成六十余种。这样大量的教材编写工作在过去是无法做到的，只有在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针之后，广大师生破除了迷信，解放了思想，才能办得到。新教材的特点是密切结合着我国社会主义建设的实际需要。例如在工程建设测量学中，有系统地介绍了我国长江大桥，秦岭隧道、武钢、三门峡等工程测量工作的方法和技术。其次又吸取了我们学院在教育结合生产中所积累的经验和师生的科学研究成果，增加了新的内容，如高炉安装测量、高压输电线测量等，在航空摄影测量学中则增加了北大荒重沼泽地区的测量经验（像片调绘和综合测图部分）。这些都说明了，只有积极参加生产工作，才能提高教学质量，才能丰富教学内容，它们之间不但没有矛盾，而且是相得益彰的。此外，通过生产实践，又锻炼了同学们运用理论解决实际问题的本领。例如同学们在湖北钢厂测量时，他们在安装高炉系统金属圆柱壳体时，根据实际经验自己推导出比较简便的求偏心差的公式，后来在杨子钢厂和汉阳钢厂的安装工程中都普遍采用，证明这个方法非常便利，对于提高钢厂高炉安装速度，起着一定的作用。在北大荒测图时，在明显物点极少的情况下，他们摸索出了一些在特殊地区判读的方法。这些方法不是来自书本，老师们同样的也是完全不知道的，而是同学们根据实际经验运用独立思考得来的。由此同学们都深刻地体会到，理论必须与实践密切结合起来，才能显出理论的生命力，同时对于理论的理解，也只有通过实践才能更加深刻。
  教育与生产劳动相结合，发动群众，破除迷信，改变了科学研究冷冷清清的局面
    三、教育与生产劳动相结合以后可以加速科学研究的发展。过去资产阶级知识分子认为，只有专家才能进行科学研究，而科学研究的领域是狭小的，也是非常难于进入的。所以学院里的科学研究空气始终是冷冷清清的。经过这次大规模的教育结合生产劳动以后，群众的迷信打破了，并且亲眼看到，科学研究的领域是无限广阔的，而且人人都可以向科学研究进军。在生产实践中，到处都会发现科学技术上急待解决的新问题。所以几个月间就收集了几百个研究题目，于是形成了轰轰烈烈的场面。从前我们学院每年举行一次学术讨论会时，全院五系不过十来篇报告；现在则系系都在单独举行学术讨论会或教学法讨论会，而各个会的内容远远比从前全院性的讨论会更为丰富。
    不仅如此，由于解放了思想，破除了迷信，教师和同学们还在向测绘科学中的尖端技术进攻。在师生合作下，初步试制完成了一架中型光速测距仪；天文——大地测量系三年级学生试制完成了一架电流网络平差仪，它可以解算某些平差问题，保证三位数字的正确；物理和大地测量教研组的部分教师和天文——大地测量系三年级部分同学还准备在今年试制完成微波测距仪。这些尖端技术过去都是不敢想不敢碰的，现在不仅敢于提出研究这些问题，而且有些已经取得了初步的成果。这些事实说明了一个真理：通过教育结合生产劳动，发动群众，破除迷信以后，可以找到正确的科学研究道路，可以加速地推动科学研究和技术革命的发展。
    总之，在一九五八年大跃进的一年当中，高等学校里的思想情况，教学质量和科学研究方向，同其他各方面一样，都起了重大的变化，也可以说是起了本质上的变化！今天的高等学校已沿着党所指出的新方向发展。但是距离党所要求的目标，使文教工作的发展能够适应整个社会主义建设的需要，还有一段相当长的距离。因此，我坚决要在工作实践中加强自我改造，努力提高自己在各方面的水平。我相信，只有这样才能够同广大人民在一起，为社会主义事业尽一份微细的力量。
