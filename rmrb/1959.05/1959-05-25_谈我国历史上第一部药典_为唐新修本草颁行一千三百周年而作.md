On China's First Pharmacopoeia
Written to Commemorate the 1300th Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica
Zhu Yan, Ran Xiaofeng

In the 1950s of the seventh century AD, a major event occurred in the history of Chinese medicine: in the fourth year of the Xianqing reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang (659 AD), China's first pharmacopoeia, the Tang New Revised Materia Medica, was promulgated. This year marks the 1300th anniversary of the promulgation of this pharmacopoeia.

The earliest foreign pharmacopoeia was promulgated by the government of Nuremberg, Europe, in 1542 AD, which is 883 years later than the promulgation of China's Tang New Revised Materia Medica. As for the years when the United Kingdom and the United States began to promulgate pharmacopoeias, it was even later. Therefore, China's Tang New Revised Materia Medica is not only the first pharmacopoeia in Chinese history, but also can be said to be the earliest pharmacopoeia in world history.

The pharmacopoeia is one of the important legal codes for the state to protect people's health. It ensures the quality of drug production, making it conform to the requirements of clinical application, and also has the function of guiding teaching, application and research in academics. Therefore, the pharmacopoeia can often reflect the national level of medical and pharmaceutical science at that time. It is a major event in the history of Chinese pharmacy and also a major event in the history of world pharmacy that such a pharmacopoeia appeared in China 1,300 years ago.

The appearance of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica was not accidental, but an inevitable product of social development. Before this, as early as the fourth century AD, China already had a relatively complete pharmaceutical work, namely "Mingyi Bielu" which was added and revised by Tao Hongjing on the basis of "Shennong's Materia Medica" which had been handed down from earlier times. However, by the Tang Dynasty, this work gradually could not meet the requirements of the increasing number of drug varieties and the increasingly detailed division of medical subjects, and some shortcomings and errors were also found in the content, such as "confusing Yi Fanlu with Chicken Intestines, combining Tian Ba with Iris, falsely claiming that Fang Kui and Wolfsbane have the same root, leading Gouteng and Yellow Essence to be in the same category, not distinguishing lead and tin, not differentiating orange and grapefruit," etc. (see Zheng Lei Materia Medica citing Tang New Revised Materia Medica Kong Zhiyue Preface). Therefore, Su Gong (i.e. Su Jing), a famous medical scientist at that time, advocated correcting the errors in Tao Hongjing's works, clarifying the confusion in the use of drugs at that time, and initiated the revision of Materia Medica. After submitting a request to the court at that time and being approved, he and Li Ji and more than 20 others carefully examined and compiled it together. It can be seen that the compilation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica was an organized collective creation that concentrated the strength of many medical scientists and the wisdom of the masses.

The Tang New Revised Materia Medica was very serious and cautious in terms of writing principles and data collection. The book tries to preserve the characteristics of the cited literature content. The quotations from Ben Jing are in red characters, the quotations from Bie Lu are in black characters, and the newly added drugs are marked with the words "Newly Attached". Through the research and collation of ancient Materia Medica medical prescription literature, in the process of editing, drug specimens were also widely solicited from all over the country for physical verification. Supplements were added to those not recorded in Shennong's Materia Medica and Mingyi Bielu, corrections were made to those with problematic content, similarities and differences were examined, decisions were made on what to keep and what to discard, mass experience was summarized to draw conclusions, and the shape and properties of drugs were described to ensure that the names and realities of drugs matched and the content was rich and detailed.

Based on the experience of predecessors, the Tang New Revised Materia Medica widely summarized the medical achievements at that time, and had enough physical specimens for verification. Therefore, it has a high academic level and scientific value.

The Tang New Revised Materia Medica consists of 54 volumes and contains 844 kinds of drugs, 114 kinds more than "Mingyi Bielu". In the fourth century, Tao Hongjing divided drugs into seven categories; in the Tang Dynasty, the types of drugs increased greatly, especially animal drugs. Therefore, the Tang New Revised Materia Medica increased the past seven categories to nine categories, namely, Jade and Stone Section, Herb Section, Wood Section, Animal and Bird Section, Insect and Fish Section, Fruit Section, Vegetable Section, Rice and Grain Section, and Named but Useless Section. This classification according to the natural source of drugs became one of the classification rules of pharmacology in later generations. Li Shizhen, the great medical scientist of China, wrote the Compendium of Materia Medica (1596), which contains 1,892 kinds of drugs, divided into 16 sections and 60 categories, which were also developed according to this classification rule.

Medicine in the Tang Dynasty in China had greatly developed, and drug treatment was also becoming more and more complete, and clinical use of drugs was very rich, which can also be seen from the drugs contained in the Tang New Revised Materia Medica. For example, in addition to the 730 kinds of tonic drugs such as ginseng, diaphoretic and antiasthmatic drugs such as ephedra, cathartic drugs such as rhubarb, mirabilite, diuretic drugs such as poria cocos, plantago, and insecticidal drugs such as betel nut and leiwain recorded in Shennong's Materia Medica and Mingyi Bielu, 114 new varieties such as cathartic drugs such as castor seeds, insecticidal drugs such as helmswort, cooling drugs such as mint, and refreshing diuretic drugs such as tea were also added. This not only reflects the grand occasion of clinical drug use in the Tang Dynasty, but also shows that traditional Chinese medicine is constantly developing and becoming richer and richer.

Some of the drugs contained in the Tang New Revised Materia Medica are finished products manufactured using physical and chemical methods. For example, Mituoseng is lead monoxide, and Sal Ammoniac is ammonium chloride. The book describes the physical and chemical properties and clinical uses of these drugs in detail. For example, cane sugar is a crude product of sucrose. The book states that it is made by squeezing and frying sugarcane juice. This also shows that the sugar making technology at that time had a very high level.

In addition, the book also contains some medical supplies, the most prominent of which is the dental silver paste - synthesized with white tin, silver foil and mercury, which hardens like silver and is used to repair missing teeth. This shows that China had already created and used mercury amalgam to fill teeth in the Tang Dynasty, while some people in European and American countries only began to apply it in the early 19th century, more than 1,100 years later than China.

The Tang New Revised Materia Medica not only inherited and promoted the ancient Chinese pharmaceutical traditions and reflected the achievements of medicine at that time, but also absorbed some foreign drugs. For example, benzoin, borneol (borneol), kylin blood (dragon's blood), haritaki, pepper, etc., all came from foreign countries at that time, and after years of use, they have long become a part of traditional Chinese medicine. This is also the excellent tradition of the Chinese people in being good at absorbing foreign scientific achievements.

The compilation and promulgation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica, in addition to marking the great progress of medicine in China at that time, also had a good impact on international medical science, especially on Asian countries. According to the ancient Japanese history "Engi Shiki", "All doctors read Su Jing's New Revised Materia Medica"; "Those who read medical classics are limited to 460 days for Tai Su Jing and 310 days for New Revised Materia Medica". From this, it seems that at that time and for a long time afterwards, Japanese physicians used the Tang New Revised Materia Medica as a compulsory textbook and spent nearly a year studying it, which shows its great influence.

The content of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica has been preserved due to the quotation of later Materia Medica and prescription books, but the original book has long been lost. The extant ones are still Japanese handwritten scroll fragments, which were once photoprinted by Mr. Fu Yunlong of China. In the pre-liberation Dunhuang Stone Room, fragments of the Tang Materia Medica were found, but the Kuomintang reactionary government not only did not know how to properly preserve them, but also colluded with imperialist elements to steal and sell them, which caused this rare national treasure to be lost. It is now rumored to be collected in the British Royal Museum and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris.

Traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years and has rich and colorful content. The Tang New Revised Materia Medica records a part of this "great treasure house".

Traditional Chinese medicine is an important weapon for traditional Chinese medicine to fight against diseases. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are a closely linked whole. Traditional Chinese medicine is constantly developing in clinical practice, and the science of traditional Chinese medicine is also constantly improving. Since the promulgation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica, traditional Chinese medicine has made great progress in the past 1,300 years. In terms of pharmacy, the Materia Medica works alone are as vast as the ocean. To cite its more famous works, there are Tang Shenwei's Zheng Lei Materia Medica in the Song Dynasty, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty, and Zhao Xuemin's Compendium of Materia Medica Supplement in the Qing Dynasty. In particular, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty can be said to be a collection of the great achievements of pharmacy in China before the Ming Dynasty. In short, these works all show that traditional Chinese medicine has gradually developed and grown on the basis of its predecessors, becoming better and better. Until now, traditional Chinese medicine still occupies an extremely important position in the people's health care cause.

The Communist Party of China and the People's Government have always attached importance to their own national cultural heritage. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have long called for the unity and cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and better serving the people's health. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the People's Government more clearly formulated the policy of traditional Chinese medicine. In 1950, the Central Ministry of Health convened a National Health Administration Conference, and according to the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, clearly defined "unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine" as one of the guiding principles of medical and health work. In 1954, the Party Central Committee more clearly pointed out that the key to inheriting and carrying forward traditional Chinese medicine lies in Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine, and adopted the policy of "systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, and sorting out and improvement" in order to gradually improve its academic level through serious study and research of its theory and practical experience, and summarize it with modern scientific methods, so as to serve the people more effectively. In the ten years since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party, through the unity and cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine personnel, with the continuous victories of socialist construction, traditional Chinese medicine work has also achieved great achievements. For example, a large number of books and periodicals on traditional Chinese medicine have been published, verified prescriptions, single prescriptions and secret prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine have been collected and compiled, the management of traditional Chinese medicine has been strengthened, the production of traditional Chinese medicine has been developed, the varieties and resources of traditional Chinese medicine have been investigated and identified, the quality and clinical efficacy of drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions have been ensured, and various scientific research on traditional Chinese medicine has been carried out, and great achievements have been made. These facts prove that the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is indeed a "great treasure house". Today, as we commemorate the 1300th anniversary of the promulgation of China's first pharmacopoeia, we have a deeper understanding of the greatness and correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. We must resolutely follow the direction indicated by the Party, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, go all out, strive to explore this valuable heritage, and make it make greater contributions to people's health.
