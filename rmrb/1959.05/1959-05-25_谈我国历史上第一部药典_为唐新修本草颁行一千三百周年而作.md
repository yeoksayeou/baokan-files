On China's First Pharmacopoeia
Written to Commemorate the 1300th Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica
Zhu Yan, Ran Xiaofeng

In the 1950s of the seventh century AD, a major event occurred in the history of Chinese medicine: in the fourth year of the Xianqing reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang (659 AD), China's first pharmacopoeia, the Tang New Revised Materia Medica, was promulgated. This year marks the 1300th anniversary of the promulgation of this pharmacopoeia.

The earliest foreign pharmacopoeia was promulgated by the government of Nuremberg, Europe, in 1542 AD, which is 883 years later than the promulgation of China's Tang New Revised Materia Medica. As for the years when the United Kingdom and the United States began to promulgate pharmacopoeias, it was even later. Therefore, China's Tang New Revised Materia Medica is not only the first pharmacopoeia in Chinese history, but also can be said to be the earliest pharmacopoeia in world history.

The pharmacopoeia is one of the important legal codes for the state to protect people's health. It ensures the quality of drug production, making it conform to the requirements of clinical application, and also has the function of guiding teaching, application and research in academics. Therefore, the pharmacopoeia can often reflect the national level of medical and pharmaceutical science at that time. It is a major event in the history of Chinese pharmacy and also a major event in the history of world pharmacy that such a pharmacopoeia appeared in China 1,300 years ago.

The appearance of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica was not accidental, but an inevitable product of social development. Before this, as early as the fourth century AD, China already had a relatively complete pharmaceutical work, namely "Mingyi Bielu" which was added and revised by Tao Hongjing on the basis of "Shennong's Materia Medica" which had been handed down from earlier times. However, by the Tang Dynasty, this work gradually could not meet the requirements of the increasing number of drug varieties and the increasingly detailed division of medical subjects, and some shortcomings and errors were also found in the content, such as "confusing Yi Fanlu with Chicken Intestines, combining Tian Ba with Iris, falsely claiming that Fang Kui and Wolfsbane have the same root, leading Gouteng and Yellow Essence to be in the same category, not distinguishing lead and tin, not differentiating orange and grapefruit," etc. (see Zheng Lei Materia Medica citing Tang New Revised Materia Medica Kong Zhiyue Preface). Therefore, Su Gong (i.e. Su Jing), a famous medical scientist at that time, advocated correcting the errors in Tao Hongjing's works, clarifying the confusion in the use of drugs at that time, and initiated the revision of Materia Medica. After submitting a request to the court at that time and being approved, he and Li Ji and more than 20 others carefully examined and compiled it together. It can be seen that the compilation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica was an organized collective creation that concentrated the strength of many medical scientists and the wisdom of the masses.

The Tang New Revised Materia Medica was very serious and cautious in terms of writing principles and data collection. The book tries to preserve the characteristics of the cited literature content. The quotations from Ben Jing are in red characters, the quotations from Bie Lu are in black characters, and the newly added drugs are marked with the words "Newly Attached". Through the research and collation of ancient Materia Medica medical prescription literature, in the process of editing, drug specimens were also widely solicited from all over the country for physical verification. Supplements were added to those not recorded in Shennong's Materia Medica and Mingyi Bielu, corrections were made to those with problematic content, similarities and differences were examined, decisions were made on what to keep and what to discard, mass experience was summarized to draw conclusions, and the shape and properties of drugs were described to ensure that the names and realities of drugs matched and the content was rich and detailed.

Based on the experience of predecessors, the Tang New Revised Materia Medica widely summarized the medical achievements at that time, and had enough physical specimens for verification. Therefore, it has a high academic level and scientific value.

The Tang New Revised Materia Medica consists of 54 volumes and contains 844 kinds of drugs, 114 kinds more than "Mingyi Bielu". In the fourth century, Tao Hongjing divided drugs into seven categories; in the Tang Dynasty, the types of drugs increased greatly, especially animal drugs. Therefore, the Tang New Revised Materia Medica increased the past seven categories to nine categories, namely, Jade and Stone Section, Herb Section, Wood Section, Animal and Bird Section, Insect and Fish Section, Fruit Section, Vegetable Section, Rice and Grain Section, and Named but Useless Section. This classification according to the natural source of drugs became one of the classification rules of pharmacology in later generations. Li Shizhen, the great medical scientist of China, wrote the Compendium of Materia Medica (1596), which contains 1,892 kinds of drugs, divided into 16 sections and 60 categories, which were also developed according to this classification rule.

Medicine in the Tang Dynasty in China had greatly developed, and drug treatment was also becoming more and more complete, and clinical use of drugs was very rich, which can also be seen from the drugs contained in the Tang New Revised Materia Medica. For example, in addition to the 730 kinds of tonic drugs such as ginseng, diaphoretic and antiasthmatic drugs such as ephedra, cathartic drugs such as rhubarb, mirabilite, diuretic drugs such as poria cocos, plantago, and insecticidal drugs such as betel nut and leiwain recorded in Shennong's Materia Medica and Mingyi Bielu, 114 new varieties such as cathartic drugs such as castor seeds, insecticidal drugs such as helmswort, cooling drugs such as mint, and refreshing diuretic drugs such as tea were also added. This not only reflects the grand occasion of clinical drug use in the Tang Dynasty, but also shows that traditional Chinese medicine is constantly developing and becoming richer and richer.

Some of the drugs contained in the Tang New Revised Materia Medica are finished products manufactured using physical and chemical methods. For example, Mituoseng is lead monoxide, and Sal Ammoniac is ammonium chloride. The book describes the physical and chemical properties and clinical uses of these drugs in detail. For example, cane sugar is a crude product of sucrose. The book states that it is made by squeezing and frying sugarcane juice. This also shows that the sugar making technology at that time had a very high level.

In addition, the book also contains some medical supplies, the most prominent of which is the dental silver paste - synthesized with white tin, silver foil and mercury, which hardens like silver and is used to repair missing teeth. This shows that China had already created and used mercury amalgam to fill teeth in the Tang Dynasty, while some people in European and American countries only began to apply it in the early 19th century, more than 1,100 years later than China.

The Tang New Revised Materia Medica not only inherited and promoted the ancient Chinese pharmaceutical traditions and reflected the achievements of medicine at that time, but also absorbed some foreign drugs. For example, benzoin, borneol (borneol), kylin blood (dragon's blood), haritaki, pepper, etc., all came from foreign countries at that time, and after years of use, they have long become a part of traditional Chinese medicine. This is also the excellent tradition of the Chinese people in being good at absorbing foreign scientific achievements.

The compilation and promulgation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica, in addition to marking the great progress of medicine in China at that time, also had a good impact on international medical science, especially on Asian countries. According to the ancient Japanese history "Engi Shiki", "All doctors read Su Jing's New Revised Materia Medica"; "Those who read medical classics are limited to 460 days for Tai Su Jing and 310 days for New Revised Materia Medica". From this, it seems that at that time and for a long time afterwards, Japanese physicians used the Tang New Revised Materia Medica as a compulsory textbook and spent nearly a year studying it, which shows its great influence.

The content of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica has been preserved due to the quotation of later Materia Medica and prescription books, but the original book has long been lost. The extant ones are still Japanese handwritten scroll fragments, which were once photoprinted by Mr. Fu Yunlong of China. In the pre-liberation Dunhuang Stone Room, fragments of the Tang Materia Medica were found, but the Kuomintang reactionary government not only did not know how to properly preserve them, but also colluded with imperialist elements to steal and sell them, which caused this rare national treasure to be lost. It is now rumored to be collected in the British Royal Museum and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.

Traditional Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years and has rich and colorful content. The Tang New Revised Materia Medica records a part of this "great treasure house".

Traditional Chinese medicine is an important weapon for traditional Chinese medicine to fight against diseases. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are a closely linked whole. Traditional Chinese medicine is constantly developing in clinical practice, and the science of traditional Chinese medicine is also constantly improving. Since the promulgation of the Tang New Revised Materia Medica, traditional Chinese medicine has made great progress in the past 1,300 years. In terms of pharmacy, the Materia Medica works alone are as vast as the ocean. To cite its more famous works, there are Tang Shenwei's Zheng Lei Materia Medica in the Song Dynasty, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty, and Zhao Xuemin's Compendium of Materia Medica Supplement in the Qing Dynasty. In particular, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty can be said to be a collection of the great achievements of pharmacy in China before the Ming Dynasty. In short, these works all show that traditional Chinese medicine has gradually developed and grown on the basis of its predecessors, becoming better and better. Until now, traditional Chinese medicine still occupies an extremely important position in the people's health care cause.

The Communist Party of China and the People's Government have always attached importance to their own national cultural heritage. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have long called for the unity and cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, inheriting and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and better serving the people's health. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the People's Government more clearly formulated the policy of traditional Chinese medicine. In 1950, the Central Ministry of Health convened a National Health Administration Conference, and according to the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, clearly defined "unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine" as one of the guiding principles of medical and health work. In 1954, the Party Central Committee more clearly pointed out that the key to inheriting and carrying forward traditional Chinese medicine lies in Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine, and adopted the policy of "systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, and sorting out and improvement" in order to gradually improve its academic level through serious study and research of its theory and practical experience, and summarize it with modern scientific methods, so as to serve the people more effectively. In the ten years since the founding of the country, under the leadership of the Party, through the unity and cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine personnel, with the continuous victories of socialist construction, traditional Chinese medicine work has also achieved great achievements. For example, a large number of books and periodicals on traditional Chinese medicine have been published, verified prescriptions, single prescriptions and secret prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine have been collected and compiled, the management of traditional Chinese medicine has been strengthened, the production of traditional Chinese medicine has been developed, the varieties and resources of traditional Chinese medicine have been investigated and identified, the quality and clinical efficacy of drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions have been ensured, and various scientific research on traditional Chinese medicine has been carried out, and great achievements have been made. These facts prove that the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is indeed a "great treasure house". Today, as we commemorate the 1300th anniversary of the promulgation of China's first pharmacopoeia, we have a deeper understanding of the greatness and correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. We must resolutely follow the direction indicated by the Party, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, go all out, strive to explore this valuable heritage, and make it make greater contributions to people's health.

    谈我国历史上第一部药典
    为唐新修本草颁行一千三百周年而作
    朱颜　冉小峰
    公元七世纪五十年代，我国医学史上发生了一件大事：在唐高宗显庆四年（公元659年）颁行了我国历史上第一部药典——唐新修本草。今年是这部药典颁行的一千三百周年。
    外国最早的一部药典是欧洲纽伦堡政府于公元1542年颁布的，要比我国唐代新修本草的颁行晚八百八十三年；至于英美各国开始颁行药典的年代，更要晚得多。因此，我国唐代新修本草不但是我国历史上第一部药典，而且也可以说是世界历史上最早的一部药典。
    药典是国家保障人民健康的重要法典之一。它保证药物生产的质量，使其符合于临床应用的要求，并且在学术上有指导教学、应用和研究的作用。因此，药典常常可以反映国家当时的医药科学水平。我国远在一千三百年前出现这样一部药典，这是中国药学史上的一件大事，同时也是世界药学史上的一件大事。
    唐新修本草的出现不是偶然的，这是社会发展的必然产物。在此以前，即远在公元四世纪以前，我国就已有了比较完备的药学著作，即陶弘景在从更早年代流传下来的“神农本草经”基础上增订起来的“名医别录”。但是，这部著作到了唐代，渐渐不能适应药物品种日益增多和医学分科日趋细致的要求，而且在内容上也发现了一些缺点和错误，如“异蘩缕于鸡肠，合田跋于鸢尾，防葵狼毒妄曰同根，钩吻黄精引为连类，铅锡莫辨，橙柚不分”，等等（见证类本草引唐新修本草孔志约序）。因此，当时著名的医药学家苏恭（即苏敬）主张纠正陶弘景著作中的谬误，澄清当时用药的紊乱，创议修订本草。经表请当时朝廷批准后，他就和李绩等二十余人，一起详加考订，进行编纂。可见，唐新修本草的编纂是一个集中许多医药学家力量和广大群众智慧的有组织的集体创作。
    唐新修本草在编写原则上和在资料收集上，就是非常严肃谨慎的。书中尽量保存了引用文献内容的特点，本经的引文用红色的字，别录的引文用黑色的字，新加药物则注以“新附”字样。通过古来本草医方文献的研究整理，在编辑过程中，还广泛地向全国各地征求药物标本，进行实物对证，对神农本草经和名医别录未有记载的加以补充，对内容有问题的加以纠正，考证异同，决定去取，综合群众经验做出结论，并叙述和描绘药品的形态、性状，做到药品名实相符，内容丰富翔实。
    唐新修本草在前人经验基础上，广泛总结了当时的医药成就，又有足够的实物标本对证，因此，它是具有很高的学术水平和科学价值的。
    唐新修本草全书共五十四卷，收载药物八百四十四种，比“名医别录”增加了一百十四种。在四世纪时，陶弘景曾把药物分为七大类；到了唐代，药物种类大有增加，尤其是动物药增加更多。因此，唐新修本草把过去的七大类增为九大类，即玉石部、草部、木部、兽禽部、虫鱼部、果部、菜部、米谷部、有名无用部等。这种按药物自然来源的分类，成为后世的药物学分类法则之一。我国伟大的医药学家李时珍著本草纲目（1596年），收载药品一千八百九十二种，分为十六部六十类，也是按照这个分类法则而加以发展的。
    我国唐代医药学已有很大发展，在药物治疗方面也日臻完备，临床用药非常丰富，从唐新修本草所收载的药物中也可以看出这一点。例如，除了神农本草经和名医别录所收载的强壮药人参、发汗平喘药麻黄、泻下药大黄、芒硝、利尿药茯苓、车前子、杀虫药槟榔、雷丸等七百三十种以外，还增加了泻下药蓖麻子、杀虫药鹤虱、辛凉药薄荷、提神利尿药茶叶等一百十四种新品种。这就不但反映了唐代临床用药的盛况，而且还说明了祖国医药学是不断发展、越来越丰富的。
    唐新修本草所收载的药品中，有一部分是运用物理、化学方法制造的成品。如蜜陀僧是一氧化铅，?砂是氯化铵，书中对这些药品的物理和化学性质、临床用途等都作了详细的描述。又如砂糖就是蔗糖的粗制品，书中说明它系由甘蔗榨汁煎制而成。由此也可见当时制糖技术已有很高的水平。
    此外，书中还收载了一些医疗用品，其中最突出的就是牙科用的银膏——用白锡、银薄及水银合成，凝硬如银，用以补缀牙齿缺落。这说明我国唐代已经创用汞合金充填牙齿，而欧美各国到了十九世纪初叶才有人开始应用，要比我国晚一千一百多年。
    唐新修本草不但继承和发扬了我国古代的药学传统，反映了当时医药学的成就，而且还吸收了一些外来的药物。例如，安息香、龙脑香（冰片）、麒麟竭（血竭）、呵黎勒、胡椒等，在当时都来自外国，经过此后多年的沿用，早就成为中药的一部分了。这也是我国历代人民善于吸收外来科学成果的优良传统。
    唐新修本草的纂成和颁行，除了标志着我国当时医药学的巨大进步外，还对国际医药科学起了良好的影响，尤其是对亚洲各国的影响更为深刻。据日本古史“延喜式”记载，“凡医生皆读苏敬新修本草”；“凡读医经者，太素经限四百六十日，新修本草三百十日”。由此看来，当时和以后很长的一个时期内，日本医师曾以唐新修本草为必修课本，而且要用将近一年的时间来学习，可见其影响之大。
    唐新修本草的内容，因后世本草及方书转引而保留下来，而其原书则早已亡佚，现存的尚有日本传抄的卷子本残卷，曾经我国傅云龙氏影印。在解放前敦煌石室中曾发现了唐本草残本，但是，国民党反动政府不但不知妥为保藏，且和帝国主义分子勾结盗卖，竟使这一稀世国宝遭到丧失，现闻辗转收藏于英国皇家博物院和法国巴黎图书馆等处。
    祖国医药学已有几千年的历史，具有丰富多彩的内容，唐新修本草所记载的是这个“伟大的宝库”中的一部分。
    中药是中医用以和疾病作斗争的重要武器，因此中医中药是一个密切联系的整体；中医学在临床实践中不断地发展，中药学术也随着不断地提高。唐新修本草颁行以后，一千三百年以来，祖国医药学已经大有进展。在药学方面，单单本草著作就已浩如烟海。今举其较著者，在宋代有唐慎微的证类本草，在明代有李时珍的本草纲目，在清代有赵学敏的本草纲目拾遗，尤其是明代李时珍的本草纲目，可以说是集我国明代以前药学的大成。总之，这些著作都说明中医中药在前人基础上逐步发展光大，越来越好。直到现在，中医中药在人民保健事业上仍占有极其重要的地位。
    中国共产党和人民政府一向重视自己祖国文化遗产。党中央和毛主席早就号召中西医团结合作，继承和发扬祖国医药学遗产，更好地为人民健康服务。中华人民共和国成立以后，党和人民政府更明确地制定了中医政策。1950年中央卫生部召开了一次全国卫生行政会议，根据中央和毛主席的指示，明确地把“团结中西医”作为医药卫生工作方针之一。1954年党中央更明确指出继承和发扬祖国医药的关键在于西医学习中医，并采取了“系统学习、全面掌握、整理提高”的方针，以期通过认真学习和研究它的学理和实践经验，用现代科学方法加以整理和总结，以逐步提高它的学术水平，更有效地为人民服务。建国十年来，在党的领导下，通过中西医药人员的团结合作，随着社会主义建设的节节胜利，中药工作也获得了巨大的成就。例如，出版了大量中医中药的书籍和期刊，收集和汇编了中医中药验方、单方和秘方，加强了对中药的管理，发展了中药的生产，对中药的品种和资源进行了调查和鉴定，保证了中医处方用药的质量和临床疗效，并且进行了关于中医中药的各项科学研究，取得了巨大成绩。这些事实证明了祖国医药学遗产确是一个“伟大的宝库”。我们今天纪念我国历史上第一部药典颁行一千三百周年，更体会到党的中医政策的伟大和正确。我们要坚决按照党所指示的方向，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，鼓足干劲，努力发掘这份宝贵遗产，使它对人民健康作出更大的贡献。
