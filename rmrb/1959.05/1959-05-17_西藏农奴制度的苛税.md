The Harsh Taxes of the Tibetan Serf System
Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Chaoren

There is a Tibetan saying among farmers: "Harsh taxes are like cattle hair, levied from birth to death." The heaviness and cruelty of the Tibetan serf system's harsh taxes drove countless families to ruin and desperation! The working people of Tibet bitterly called the various harsh taxes imposed on them by the serf owners "Jia Ta" (iron chains).

Just how many types of harsh taxes were there in the Tibetan serf system? No one can answer this question. Tibetan serf owners (the former Tibetan local government, monasteries, nobles, and headmen) never used any rules or customs to restrict their right to levy taxes. In Tibetan society, the will of the serf owners was the law, and they levied the "taxes" they needed according to their desires and insatiable greed. In addition to bearing the triple burdens of taxes and levies from the Tibetan government, monasteries, and large estate owners, a serf also had to bear the arbitrary levies imposed by lower-level headmen, stewards, and serf owner henchmen. According to investigations in Gyantse, Bailang, and Lhatse Dzongs (equivalent to counties), it is generally estimated that "Chaba" (a higher-status serf) and "Duichung" (a lower-status serf than Chaba) paid from seventy to one hundred kinds of "taxes," both named and unnamed, each year in addition to bearing a large amount of "Ula" (corvée labor) and land rent.

Let's see how much blood and sweat a serf, as a "person," was squeezed out of from the first day they left their mother's womb until death!

When a little serf was born, the serf owner immediately recorded the name in the roster and immediately collected the little serf's first tax from the parents: a "birth tax" of 1.5 liang of Tibetan silver (at the 1956 exchange rate, about six fen in RMB per liang). From then on, 1.5 liang of "baby tax" continued to be paid every year. When the little serf reached the age of eighteen, they began to bear "head tax." The amount of "head tax" varied from five to fifty liang of Tibetan silver, depending on the area. If the little serf wanted to escape the "bitter sea" of the world and become a lama, in addition to sending gifts to beg the serf owner for approval, they also had to pay 19 liang of Tibetan silver as a "temple entry tax." When men and women married, they also had to present "Hada" (ceremonial scarves), butter, and Tibetan silver to the serf owner. Only with the serf owner's consent could the ceremony be held; this was actually a kind of harsh tax. If a serf violated the serf owner's laws and was sent to prison, they had to pay "imprisonment tax." Even more appalling, the former Tibetan local government stipulated a "ear tax" more than thirty years ago in order to raise military expenses for expanding the Tibetan army. Each person had to pay two liang of Tibetan silver per ear per year, for a total of four liang of Tibetan silver for both ears. The former Tibetan local government even explicitly ordered that if the "ear tax" was not paid, the "Lemo" (tax collector) had the right to cut off the ears of the tax debtor. Until the suppression of the rebellion, headmen in some areas were still collecting this tax. In some remote mountain villages, serf owners also stipulated that people with single eyelids had to pay taxes, as did people with braids. If one bought a new piece of clothing or a pair of leather boots, they also had to pay "new clothes tax" and "new boots tax." After the age of sixty, when people were weak and unable to pay "Ula" to the serf owner, they had to pay "exemption tax" every year. Homeless vagrants or disabled people had to pay three to fifteen liang of Tibetan silver annually for some unknown tax—perhaps a "begging tax" or "disability tax"! And even after death, the harsh taxes were not over: the family had to take the deceased's earrings (an ornament) to report to the serf owner. If there were no earrings (generally, earrings were worth hundreds of liang of Tibetan silver, and most serfs could not afford them during their lifetimes), the family had to pay a certain amount of "corpse disposal tax" to the serf owner.

However, the harsh taxes paid by serfs as "people" were far less burdensome than the harsh taxes they paid in production. According to a survey in Bailang Dzong near Gyantse (where the manor of Pala Thubten Woyede, one of the ringleaders of the rebellion, was located): In addition to paying 374 man-days and a large amount of land rent per "Kang" (one Kang refers to land that sows 18 "Ke" of seeds; one Ke is equivalent to 25 jin, and the size of a Kang varies from place to place) to the lord (landowner) each year, a "Chaba" had to pay nearly 20 kinds of "miscellaneous taxes" specifically to the former Tibetan local government: such as 10 Ke of barley as food expenses for the Dzongpon (county head), 32 Tibetan jin of mutton (equivalent to more than eight sheep), 3 Ke of butter (one Ke of butter is heavier than one Ke of grain), dozens of jin of firewood, two cloth pockets, a certain amount for the Dzong government's delivery fees, one Ke of barley for official entertainment expenses, five Ke of barley for post station repair fees, three qian of Tibetan silver for the Dzong government's paper expenses, two liang of Tibetan silver for the Dzong government's incense expenses for worshiping gods, a certain amount of horse fodder expenses for officials, a certain amount for the Tibetan government's freight transport expenses, three liang of Tibetan silver given to the Dzong government as expenses for alms to lamas, and several "holiday fees" for Tibetan government officials each year, etc. When the reporter interviewed in Gyantse in 1957, he specifically investigated the family of a "Chaba" named Zangda. Zangda's family of twelve rented 24 Ke of land from the Tibetan government. In the best year (calculated at five times the seeds sown), they earned 120 Ke of grain, paid 30 Ke of grain for land rent, and 40 Ke of grain for miscellaneous taxes, leaving 50 Ke of grain for the whole year (not including "tributes" to the Dzongpon and headmen). The minimum living standard for twelve people required a total of 180 Ke of grain for the whole year, resulting in a grain deficit of 130 Ke each year.

Moju Zedeng, a farmer from the western suburbs of Lhasa, told reporters a few days ago that his family was much poorer than when his father was alive decades ago, but he still had to pay many kinds of "trumped-up" taxes every year according to his father's family situation. When Moju Zedeng's father was alive, he rented two Ke of land from the lord. More than 50 years ago, he returned the land to the lord because he could not afford to cultivate it. However, Moju Zedeng still had to pay 35 Ke of zanba (roasted barley flour) as "land tax" every year. Moju Zedeng's grandfather had a cow, which died when his father was alive. Moju Zedeng has never seen a cow since he took charge of the family, but the serf owner still required Moju Zedeng to pay 10 liang of Tibetan silver as "hoof tax" every year, based on the record of a cow in his grandfather's roster. Wangqiu, a farmer from Dangba Village in the suburbs of Lhasa, said that his father had two chickens, but he himself did not even have a chicken feather. However, he still had to pay 10 eggs as "chicken tax" to the lord every year, calculated according to two chickens. People who plant trees on barren mountains have to pay a "tree tax" of one qian of Tibetan silver per tree per year, starting from the year the trees survive.

The former Tibetan local government's taxation on animal husbandry was even more brutal. Extremely poor people had to pay a "whip tax" when herding cattle and sheep for the serf owners. Cattle and sheep grazing on the grasslands had to pay one Ke of barley per cow per year (equivalent to the annual income of a herder), two Ke of butter for each calf born to a dairy cow, and one Ke of butter for each lamb born to a ewe. In addition, every fifty cattle had to give 25 loads of cow dung (the load of a mule is one load) to the Tibetan government every year, and no matter how many sheep there were, they had to "sleep overnight" on the lord's "self-operated land" for 15 days each year (using sheep manure as fertilizer). A horse paid a "horse tax" of eight cheng (400 liang) of Tibetan silver each year. If two families shared a horse, each paid four cheng of Tibetan silver, but the former Tibetan local government arbitrarily stipulated that both families had to arrive at the same time when paying taxes and both families had to have a horse to lead, which was of course impossible. The family that did not bring a horse had to pay an additional 100 eggs. People who have not been exposed to Tibetan serf society can hardly imagine that the lives of more than 1.1 million serfs here are so dark and miserable. The vast number of working people often had to exhaust their last bit of property for those absurd tax items, while living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. When the reporter interviewed in some areas of the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, he investigated the income and expenditure of some "Chaba" who lived relatively well among the serfs. These "Chaba" generally paid 65.3% of their total annual income to the serf owners as land rent and harsh taxes, and many people relied on wild vegetables and wild animals for food for several months of the year. As for the vast number of serfs and "Lang Sheng" (domestic slaves) living at the lowest level of society, their lives were even more miserable!

    西藏农奴制度的苛税
    新华社记者  郭超人
    西藏农民中有一句谚语：“苛税像牛毛，从生缴到死”。西藏农奴制度苛税的沉重和残酷，逼着多少人家破人亡，走投无路！西藏劳动人民把农奴主压在他们身上的种种苛税痛恨地叫做“夹踏”（铁链）。
    西藏农奴制度的苛税种类究竟有多少？没有人能够回答这个问题。西藏农奴主们（原西藏地方政府、寺庙、贵族和头人）从来不用什么规章和惯例来束缚自己征税的权利。在西藏社会中，农奴主的意志就是法律，他们根据自己的欲望，贪婪无厌地摊派他们所需要的“税款”。一个农奴除了负担藏政府、寺庙和大领主的三重差税外，还要负担基层小头人、管家和农奴主爪牙的随意摊派。据江孜、白朗、拉孜等宗（相当于县）的调查，一般地计算，“差巴”（农奴中地位较高的一种）和“堆穷”（地位比差巴低一等的农奴）每年除负担大量“乌拉”
  （差役）和地租外，有名目的和没有名目的“税”即有七十种到一百种之多。
    请看农奴作为一个“人”，从离开母体第一天直到死亡，要被农奴主榨取多少血汗吧！
    小农奴出世了，农奴主立即把名字记上花名册，随即向父母收缴小农奴的第一次税：“出生税”藏银一两五钱（按1956年比价，藏银一两约合人民币六分多），从此，每年继续上缴一两五钱的
  “娃娃税”。小农奴长到十八岁，就开始负担“人头税”，“人头税”数额从藏银五两到五十两，各地不同。如果小农奴想摆脱人间“苦海”去当喇嘛，除要送礼恳求农奴主批准外，还得交藏银十九两作为“进庙税”。男女婚嫁，也要向农奴主赠献
  “哈达”、酥油和藏银，只有农奴主同意了才能举行仪式，这实际上还是一种苛税。农奴如果触犯了农奴主的法令，被送进监狱时，得交“入狱税”。而更骇人听闻的是，原西藏地方政府为扩充藏军征集的军费，在三十多年前规定了一种“耳朵税”，每人每年每只耳朵上税藏银二两，两只耳朵共藏银四两，原西藏地方政府甚至明令：如果不交“耳朵税”，“勒莫”（收税官）就有权将欠税人的耳朵割掉。直到叛乱平息以前，有些地区的头人还在征收这种税。在一些偏僻的山村里，农奴主还规定单眼皮的人要上税，留辫子的人也要上税，新买了一件衣服、一双皮靴，也要上“新衣税”和“新靴税”。人到六十岁以后，体衰力弱无法向农奴主支付“乌拉”时，每年要交“免差税”。无家可归的流浪汉或残废人，每年得交纳藏银三两到十五两的不知什么名目的税——也许算是“乞讨税”或“残废税”吧！而在人死以后，苛税还没有结束：家属必须将死者的耳坠（一种装饰品）拿去向农奴主报告，如果没有耳坠（一般耳坠都值藏银数百两，大部分农奴生前根本买不起），必须向农奴主交“送尸税”若干。
    但是，农奴作为一个“人”所付出的苛税，远不如他们在生产方面所付出的苛税沉重。据江孜附近的白朗宗（叛匪首脑之一帕拉·土登为登的庄园就在那里）的调查：一个“差巴”每年除向领主（土地所有者）按每“岗”（一岗指种十八克种子的地，一克合二十五斤，各地岗的大小不一）地支付三百七十四个人工和大量地租外，还得专门向原西藏地方政府缴纳各种“杂税”近二十项：如给宗本（县长）伙食费十克青稞，羊肉三十二藏斤（合八只羊以上），酥油三克（一克酥油比一克粮食要重一些），烧柴数十斤，布口袋二条，宗政府送信费若干，官员应酬费一克青稞，驿站修缮费五克青稞，宗政府用纸费藏银三钱，宗政府敬神用的香费藏银二两，官员马草费若干，藏政府运送杂货费若干，给宗政府作为向喇嘛布施的费用藏银三两，还有给藏政府官员私人每年几次的“过节费”等等。记者1957年在江孜采访时，专门调查过一个名叫藏达的“差巴”家庭。藏达全家十二口人，租种藏政府二十四克地，最好年成（按种子的五倍计算）收入一百二十克粮食，地租付出粮食三十克，杂税付出粮食四十克，全年剩粮五十克（还不包括给宗本和头人的“孝敬”），而十二口人最低生活水平，全年共需粮食一百八十克，每年亏空粮食一百三十克之多。
    拉萨西郊农民莫珠泽登前几天告诉记者说，他的父亲死了几十年，他家已经比他父亲在时要贫困得多，但每年仍然按照他父亲时的家境交出许多种“莫须有”的税。莫珠泽登父亲时租种了领主两克地，后来因无力耕种将土地退给领主已五十多年了，可是，莫珠泽登每年还得交三十五克糌粑作为“地税”。莫珠泽登祖父时有一条牛，到他父亲时就死了，莫珠泽登当家以来从未见过牛，可是农奴主仍根据他祖父时花名册有一条牛的记载，每年要莫珠泽登缴“牛蹄税”藏银十两。拉萨郊区当巴村农民旺秋说他父亲时有两只鸡，到他自己手上连鸡毛都没有一根，可是每年仍向领主按两只鸡计算，缴“鸡税”十个鸡蛋。人们在荒山上种植树木，从树木成活的那一年开始，每棵树每年要缴“树税”藏银一钱。
    原西藏地方政府关于牧业方面的税收更是惨重无比。特别贫穷的人为农奴主放牧牛羊时，要向藏政府缴“鞭子税”。牛羊在草原上放牧，每年每牛要交一克青稞（相当于一个牧工的全年收入），奶牛生一牛犊上税二克酥油，母羊下一羊羔上税一克酥油。此外，每五十头牛每年要给藏政府牛粪二十五驮（一只毛驴的负重为一驮），羊子无论多少，每
  年要到领主的“自营地”上“卧夜”十五天（利用羊粪作肥料）。一匹马每年上“马税”藏银八秤（合四百两），如果两家共用一匹马，则各交藏银四秤，但原西藏地方政府蛮横地规定在交税时两家必须同时到达并且两家都有马可牵，这当然是不可能的。没有牵着马去的那家，就要再补缴鸡蛋一百个。没有接触过西藏农奴社会的人，很难想像这里一百一十多万农奴的生活是如此黑暗和悲惨，广大劳动人民往往不得不为那些荒诞的税目而倾尽最后一点家产，自己则过着牛马不如的生活。记者在雅鲁藏布江上游一些地方采访时，曾调查了一些在农奴中生活较好的“差巴”的收支情况。这些“差巴”一般都把全年总收入的65.3％作为地租和苛税交给了农奴主，许多人每年有好几个月靠野菜和野牲为食。至于广大农奴和生活在社会最低层的“朗生”（家奴），他们的生活更不用说是怎样的悲惨！
