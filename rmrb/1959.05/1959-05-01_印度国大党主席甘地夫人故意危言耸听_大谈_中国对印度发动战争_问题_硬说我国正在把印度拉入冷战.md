Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to reports from the Indian Press Trust, Indira Gandhi, Chairman of the Indian National Congress and daughter of Prime Minister Nehru, attacked China head-on in Kerala on the 29th while attacking the Indian Communist Party regarding the Tibetan rebellion. She insisted that China was pulling India into the "Cold War," and she even talked about the so-called "China launching a war against India" issue.

Indira Gandhi is currently on a three-day visit to Kerala. She told a public gathering in Kottayam in that state, "China is trying to pull India into the Cold War over the Tibet issue. But not a single communist opposes this, and not a single communist is heard saying: If China launches a war against India, the communists will fight for India."

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - San Francisco Dispatch: Indian Ambassador to the United States, Chagla, said at a press conference in San Francisco on the 28th that China's suppression of Tibetans makes Indians feel regret.

"Because we respect human rights and individual freedom." He said, "We are loyal to peace and democracy, but we will continue to be friendly with China."

He believes that India will not abandon its neutral policy because of events happening in neighboring Tibet. He said: "You will not change your principles because someone does not respect your principles."

The ambassador said that if India cannot manage to make enough progress economically, its people "will ask the government to experiment with Chinese methods." He said, "All of Asia is watching Red China's continuous progress and asking: What are the fruits of our freedom?"

In his speech, Chagla also groundlessly said that if India were to be attacked, so-called "from China, Russia or elsewhere," it would have to "defend itself."

    印度国大党主席甘地夫人故意危言耸听
    大谈“中国对印度发动战争”问题
    硬说我国正在把印度拉入冷战
    新华社30日讯　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度国大党主席、尼赫鲁总理的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人29日在喀拉拉邦就西藏叛乱事件攻击印度共产党的时候，正面地攻击了中国。她硬说中国正在把印度拉入“冷战”，她甚至还谈到所谓“中国对印度发动战争”的问题。
    英迪拉·甘地夫人正在喀拉拉邦作三天访问。她对这个邦的科塔延地方举行的一次公众集会上说，“中国正试图在西藏问题上把印度拉入冷战。但是没有一个共产党人反对这件事，听不到一个共产党人表示：如果中国对印度发动战争，共产党人将为印度而战。”
    新华社30日讯　旧金山消息：印度驻美国大使查格拉28日在旧金山举行的记者招待会上说，中国对西藏的镇压使印度人感到遗憾。
    “因为我们尊重人权和个人自由”。他说：“我们忠于和平和民主，但是我们将继续同中国友好。”
    他认为印度不会因为邻近的西藏发生的事件而放弃它的中立政策。他说：“你不会因为有人不尊重你的原则而改变你的原则。”
    这位大使说，如果印度不能设法使印度在经济上取得足够的进步的话，它的人民“将要求政府试行采用中国的办法”。他说：“全亚洲都在注视着红色中国的不断前进，并且问道：我们的自由成果是什么呢？”
    查格拉在谈话中还无中生有地说什么印度如果遭到所谓“来自中国、俄国或者其他地方”的进攻，就要“进行自卫”。
