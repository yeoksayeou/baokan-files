    Past Serfs Transformed into Workers Mastering Modern Technology
    Large Numbers of Factories Built in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

    (Our reporters Ma Lie and Zhang Tinggan report) Within a year of implementing democratic reform in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, many factories have been established and developed, forming a region with a rudimentary modern industrial base encompassing metallurgy, machinery, electricity, and light industry. In the past, the Diqing area was basically in a primitive state of "slash-and-burn" agriculture. Not only was there no industry, but even handicrafts had not yet separated from agriculture. It was not until after the democratic reform that the history of the Tibetan people having no industry officially ended.

    Since the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture carried out democratic reforms in 1958, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of Han people from the interior, the Tibetan people have traversed several historical periods, establishing their own iron smelting, steelmaking, lead smelting, electricity, machinery, wool spinning, leather, and other factories, and have begun to mine raw coal and burn bricks and tiles. The establishment and rapid development of these industries have already played a significant role in developing production and improving the lives of the Tibetan people. Currently, the autonomous prefecture can produce more than enough crude steel and pig iron to meet its own needs. For the first time, the autonomous prefecture's machinery factory has produced a large number of hoes, light walking plows, four-row seeders, oxcarts, and horse-drawn carts (with rubber tires supplied by the interior) for Tibetan farmers. In the first quarter of this year alone, they produced nearly a thousand walking plows. Using plows and hoes made by themselves, Tibetan farmers have transformed over 20 million mu of cultivated land from the past practice of plowing only two or three inches deep to a universal deep plowing of six inches to over a foot. In the plateau dam areas of Dazhongdian and Xiaozhongdian, horse-drawn carts, oxcarts, and handcarts are being used extensively to accumulate and transport fertilizer, so that the vast majority of cultivated land has developed from not being fertilized in the past to applying more than 20,000 jin of base fertilizer this year. Many Tibetan farmers' homes have been covered with felt made by their own factories, and Tibetan men and women are wearing long Tibetan boots produced by their own factories that are particularly suitable for walking in the snowy mountains. The Tibetan people are very proud that the autonomous prefecture has its own factories.

    In the past, the 100,000 Tibetan compatriots living on this plateau lived a cruel, dark, and backward serf life for generations. Many poor Tibetans had never even heard the word "factory"; even cotton cloth was rarely seen. The agricultural tools they commonly used were wooden hoes and wooden plows (the plowshares were also made of wood). The knives worn by Tibetan men on their waists were usually used to chop firewood and defend against wild animals in the mountains. In battle, they became weapons, and in production, they were sometimes used as hoes and plowshares, and were called all-purpose tools. This was almost the only iron tool or agricultural implement the Tibetan people had. Before the democratic reform, in order to help the Tibetan people develop production and improve their lives, the Party and the government transported batches of iron agricultural tools and Tibetan boots and other living materials from the interior after a journey of seven or eight days. However, due to inconvenient transportation, it was difficult to meet the demand. During the democratic reform, in order to gradually change the situation of relying on support from the interior, the Diqing Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee decided to gradually establish its own industry, starting with inviting several Han blacksmiths from the interior to establish the first two blacksmithing furnaces in the autonomous prefecture. Last year, a group of Tibetan workers who came to learn at the furnaces decided to use these two furnaces to make their own lathes. However, only Yu Zhongxiang, a Han electrician in the entire prefecture, had ever seen a lathe. Relying on his own impressions, he groped his way to draw a rough sketch of the lathe. Four Tibetan carpenters who only knew how to build houses followed this sketch and, after many failures, made a model of a wooden lathe. The Tibetan workers then used brown sugar water mixed with sand to solve the difficulty of not being able to make sand casting models. With the spirit of "grinding embroidery needles on steel beams," they polished the castings on stones, overcoming the difficulty of not having a planer, and finally made their own first lathe. Using these methods, they have now produced five lathes, eight vises, and two drilling machines, and have built the first small-scale agricultural tool machinery factory with an initial scale. With the establishment and development of industrial production, the autonomous prefecture now has the first generation of more than a thousand Tibetan workers, many of whom were slaves or serfs in the past. The first dozens of Tibetan workers who joined the workforce have now become the first batch of masters in these factories; Song Yumei, a Tibetan worker who had been a slave for generations, is now the director of the autonomous prefecture's machinery factory.

    过去的农奴变成了掌握现代技术的工人
    迪庆藏族自治州建起大批工厂
    本报讯  记者马烈、张廷干报道：云南省迪庆藏族自治州在实现民主改革后的一年间，许多工厂建立和发展起来，并已形成了一个具有冶金、机械、电力和轻工业的现代工业雏型的地区。过去，迪庆地区基本处于“刀耕火种”的原始状态，不仅没有工业，甚至连手工业都还没有从农业中分离出来，直到民主改革后，才正式结束了本民族没有工业的历史。
    迪庆藏族自治州从1958年进行民主改革后，藏族人民在党的领导和内地汉族支援下，已经跨越了几个历史时期，建立了自己的炼铁、炼钢、炼铅和电力、机械、毛纺、皮革等工厂，并开始开采原煤和烧制砖瓦。这些工业的建立和迅速发展，对藏族人民发展生产和改善生活已经发挥了显著作用。目前，自治州自己炼的土钢和生铁可以自给有余。自治州机械厂第一次为藏族农民大量生产了锄头、轻便步犁、四行播种机、牛车、马车（胶轮是内地支援的）等。仅今年第一季度，他们就生产了近一千部步犁。藏族农民使用自己造出的犁头、锄头和步犁，已经把二千万多亩耕地，由过去只耕二、三寸改变为普遍深翻六寸到一尺以上，大、小中甸等高原坝区已经大量使用马车、牛车和手推车积肥运肥，使绝大部分耕地由过去不施肥发展到今年的普遍施底肥两万斤以上。许多藏族农民的家里已经铺上了自己工厂制造的毛毡，男女藏民们穿上了自己工厂出产的特别适于雪山行路的长统藏靴。藏族人民对于自治州有了自己的工厂感到非常自豪。
    过去，居住在这个高原上的十万藏族同胞，世世代代过着残酷、黑暗、落后的农奴生活，许多贫苦的藏胞，从来没有听说过“工厂”这个字眼；就连棉布也很少有人见过。他们普遍使用的农具是木锄和木犁（犁尖也是木头做的）。藏族男子腰上挎着的刀，平时上山用来砍柴和防御野兽的袭击，战斗时又成为武器，在生产上有时又被当做锄头和犁头使用，被称为万能的工具。这几乎就是藏族人民唯一的铁制工具或农具。民主改革前，党和政府为了帮助这里的藏族人民发展生产、改善生活，曾经经过七八天的路程，成批地从内地运来了铁制农具和藏靴等生活资料。但终因交通不便，难于满足要求。在民主改革期间，中共自治州工委为了逐步改变依赖内地支援的状况，决定逐步建立自治州自己的工业，并首先从内地请来了几个汉族铁匠，建立了自治州最初的两盘铁匠炉。去年，一批到炉子上来学习的藏族工人决定就用这两盘炉子自己制造车床。但是，全州只有汉族电机工人余忠祥曾经看见过车床，他凭着自己的印象，摸索着绘制了一张车床的草图，四个只会盖房子的藏族木工照着这张草图，经历了多少次的失败，做出了木制车床的模型，藏族工人们又用红糖水拌砂土解决了不会做翻砂模型的困难，用“钢梁磨绣针”的精神，在石头上磨光铸件，克服了没有刨床的困难，终于制成了自己的第一台车床。用这些办法，现在他们已经制出了五台车床、八台老虎钳和两台钻床，建成了第一个初具规模的小型农具机械厂。随着工业生产的建立和发展，自治州现在已经有了藏族的第一代一千多个工人，他们许多都是过去的奴隶或农奴。最初参加工作的几十个藏族工人，现在已经成了这些厂里的第一批师傅；祖祖辈辈当奴隶的藏族工人松玉梅，现在是自治州机械厂的厂长。
