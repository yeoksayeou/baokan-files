Greetings to the Children on "June 1st"
Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Deng Yingchao

Dear Young Pioneers, dear children:

The "June 1st" International Children's Day is fast approaching. You must be happily preparing for the festival. I wish you a very happy holiday!

I like children very much, I like all children. When I see you growing up day by day and making progress day by day, my heart is full of joy. Especially from last year's "June 1st" to this year's "June 1st," our great motherland has made leaping progress in all aspects, and you have also made great progress. This makes me particularly happy, and it is also something worth particularly congratulating you on this year's "June 1st" festival.

"June 1st" Children's Day, as you all know, is not only a festival for Chinese children, but also for children from all over the world. Let's take a look at how children in various countries celebrate their own festivals!

In our China, the Soviet Union, and all socialist countries, children are like beautiful and lively flowers blooming in a garden bathed in bright sunshine, receiving care and love from everyone. The Party, the country, and society take meticulous care of the children, just like a gardener taking care of the young seedlings they cultivate. In our socialist countries, all children have infinitely bright and promising futures. On "June 1st" Children's Day, the Party, the country, schools, and all sectors of society arrange various interesting and meaningful activities for the children to celebrate their festival happily and joyfully.

However, in colonies and semi-colonies, as well as in imperialist and capitalist countries, children are like living in houses where they cannot see the light of day. In such countries, a minority exploits the majority, and a minority oppresses the majority. Many people are selfish and self-interested. How can children obtain true happiness in such a society? There, the future of the children is bleak. The lives of the children of the working people are even more miserable. They suffer from hunger and cold with their parents, and when diseases are prevalent, it is easy to take away their young lives. How can children living this kind of life even think about celebrating their own festivals?

Dear children: These are two very different scenarios. How happy the children are in our country and in socialist countries! How beautiful our socialist society is! When you are happily celebrating your own festival, you will surely love your motherland and love socialism even more; you will surely also think: "How should I be a good child of the motherland?"

Yes, you must be good children of the motherland. At school, you must study hard, learn all subjects well, and also read some beneficial extracurricular books appropriately, so as to lay a good foundation for culture and science from an early age. At school and at home, you should participate in some labor and social welfare activities suitable for you, so as to develop good qualities of loving labor and loving the collective from an early age, and aspire to be a person who has both knowledge and practical skills. You must respect teachers, parents, and elders, and listen to their teachings! You must unite and help each other with your classmates, and be good students and good children.

Children all over the world hope to live a good life and love peace. When you are celebrating your own festival, you must be of one heart with the millions of children all over the world, strengthen mutual friendship; learn from the children of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries; and sympathize with and care for the children in other countries who are being oppressed and suffering.

Dear children: I earnestly hope that you will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Study hard" and "Make progress every day." Let me shake your hands tightly and wish you health, liveliness, bravery, and progress day by day!

    “六一”寄孩子们
    全国妇女联合会副主席　邓颖超
    亲爱的少先队员们，亲爱的孩子们：
    “六一”国际儿童节快要来到了。你们一定在欢欢喜喜地准备过节。我祝你们节日过得非常愉快！
    我很喜欢孩子，喜欢所有的孩子们。当我看到你们一天天长大、一天天进步的时候，我心里充满着快乐。特别是从去年“六一”到今年“六一”这一年中，我们伟大的祖国在各方面都有了飞跃的发展，你们也有了很大的进步，这是使我感到特别高兴的；也是今年“六一”节值得特别向你们祝贺的。
    “六一”儿童节，正如你们都知道的，不单单是中国孩子们的节日，也是世界各国孩子们的节日。让我们来看一看，各国孩子们是怎样来度自己的节日吧！
    在我们中国和苏联以及所有社会主义国家里，孩子们就像开放在阳光灿烂的花园里的鲜花一样，又美好，又活泼，受到人们的关怀和爱护。党和国家、社会对孩子们照顾得无微不至，就像园丁照顾自己栽培的嫩芽一样。在我们社会主义国家，所有的孩子都有着无限光明、远大的前途。在“六一”儿童节这一天，党和国家、学校和社会各方面，更为孩子们安排了各种有趣而又有意义的活动，让孩子们欢欢喜喜、高高兴兴地来庆祝自己的节日。
    但是在殖民地和半殖民地以及帝国主义、资本主义国家里，孩子们就像生活在不见天日的房子里。在这样的国家里，少数人剥削多数人、压迫多数人，很多人都自私自利，在这样的社会里，孩子们又怎么能得到真正的幸福呢？在那里，孩子们的前途是黑暗的。劳动人民的孩子们的生活就更悲惨了。他们和父母一道挨饿受冻，疾病流行的时候，很容易夺去他们幼小的生命。过着这种生活的孩子们，那里还谈得到庆祝自己的节日呢？
    亲爱的孩子们：这是两种多么不同的情景。在我们国家和社会主义各国的孩子们是多么的幸福；我们的社会主义社会又是多么美好啊！当你们在快乐地庆祝自己的节日的时候，你们一定会更加热爱自己的祖国，热爱社会主义；你们一定也会想到：“我应该怎样来做一个祖国的好孩子呢？”
    是的，要做祖国的好孩子。在学校里要用功读书，把各门功课都学好，还要适当地读些课外有益的书，从小打好文化科学的基础；在学校和家里都要参加一些适合你们的劳动和社会公益活动，从小养成热爱劳动、热爱集体的好品质，立志做一个既有学问、又有实际本领的人。对老师和父母、长辈们要尊敬，要听他们的教导！对同学要团结、互助，做个好学生，好孩子。
    全世界的孩子们都希望能过美好的生活，都是热爱和平的，当你们在欢庆自己节日的时候，要和全世界千千万万的孩子们心连心，加强互相间的友谊；要向苏联和社会主义各国的小朋友学习；对其他国家正在受压迫受苦难的小朋友们，应该同情他们，关怀他们。
    亲爱的孩子们：我热切地希望你们永远记住毛主席的教导：“好好学习”“天天向上”。让我紧紧地握你们的手，祝你们健康、活泼、勇敢、一天比一天进步！
