Prevent Lodging by Starting in the Seedling Stage
    Hu Lei

Learning from the masses, summarizing the experiences of the masses, improving upon them, and promoting them universally—this is the leadership method of the mass line. The Pingyuan County Party Committee's promotion of the experience in preventing lodging is done in this way.

Every year, some crops in our country suffer yield reductions due to lodging. Especially in high-yield fields, where water and fertilizer are abundant, plants are tall, ears are large, and foliage is dense, lodging is more likely to occur in windy and rainy weather. In order to cope with lodging, people have spent a lot of effort and money, such as building frames and supports for crops like wheat and corn, pulling nets, tying bundles, and even manually supporting plants row by row. These tasks are both arduous and strenuous. Not to mention the reduced harvest due to lodging. This is a problem that must be properly solved.

Why do crops lodge? There are many reasons, and they vary for different crops. But no matter what crop, the most fundamental reason depends on two aspects: first, cultivation, such as tillage, application of base fertilizer, variety, density, row spacing, plant spacing, etc.; second, field management. Field management is further divided into three stages: seedling stage, mid-stage, and late stage. According to years of experience, farmers in many regions of our country regard the seedling stage as the key period for preventing lodging; the method is the so-called "suppressing seedlings." Using this method makes the roots of crops developed, the basal nodes strong, and the wind resistance strong, making it easier to avoid lodging in the middle and late stages. Therefore, preventing lodging must start in the seedling stage.

This method of paying attention to preventing lodging from the seedling stage has been effective among the masses in some areas for many years. Unfortunately, this experience has not received widespread attention. Some people even dismiss the "seedling suppression method" with a smile, saying it is a "well-known" "old method," as if it is only timely to mention lodging prevention in the later stage. In fact, if the old method is effective, what's wrong with it? If it is "well-known" but has not been widely adopted, it should still be advocated.

The "seedling suppression method" promoted by Pingyuan County is a fundamental method for preventing lodging. It is like laying a foundation for a tall building. This is a down-to-earth approach, and it is also in line with the spirit of acting early and striving for the initiative, and in line with the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The Pingyuan County Party Committee's early promotion of this experience this year reflects a work style of following the mass line and a down-to-earth work style, which is worthy of great promotion.

    防倒伏要从苗期下手
    胡雷
    向群众学习，总结群众经验，加以提高，普遍推广，这就是群众路线的领导方法。中共平原县委推广防倒伏的经验，就是这样做的。
    我国年年都有一些作物倒伏减产。尤其高额丰产田，水肥充足，棵高穗大，枝叶茂密，遇到风雨交加的天气，更容易倒伏。人们为了对付倒伏，曾经花费很多功夫和财物，如给小麦、玉米等作物扎架支杆，拉网绑把，甚至逐垅逐棵用手扶。这些工作既繁重，又吃力。因倒伏而减少收成，就更不必说了。这是一个必须妥善解决的问题。
    作物为什么会倒伏？原因很多，各种作物也不一样。但不管什么作物，最根本的决定于两个方面：一是耕种，如耕地、施基肥、品种、密度、行距、株距等；二是田间管理。田间管理又分为苗期、中期、后期三个阶段。我国许多地区的农民根据多年的经验，都把苗期作为防倒伏的关键时期；方法就是所谓“蹲苗”。运用这种方法使农作物的根系发达，基节粗壮，抗风力强，中、后期就容易避免倒伏。所以，防倒伏必须从苗期下手。
    这种从苗期注意防倒伏的方法，是一些地区群众中间多少年来行之有效的。可惜的是，这条经验并没有受到普遍重视。有些人一提“蹲苗法”，还一笑置之，说什么这是“人人皆知”的“旧办法”，好像非到后期再提防倒伏才算适时。其实，旧办法如果有效，有什么不好？“人人皆知”而还没有普遍采用，就仍然应该再提倡。
    平原县推广的这条“蹲苗法”，对防倒伏来讲，是一种治本的方法。它好比给高楼大厦铺石奠基一样。这是一种踏踏实实的作法，也合乎早动手争主动的精神，合乎多快好省的方针。平原县委今年及早地推广了这条经验，这是走群众路线的作风，也是踏踏实实的作风，值得大大提倡。
