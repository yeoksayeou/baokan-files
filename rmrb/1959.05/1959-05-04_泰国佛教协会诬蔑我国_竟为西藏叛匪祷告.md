Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Bangkok: The Thai Buddhist Association issued a statement on April 28 regarding the Tibetan rebellion, maliciously slandering China.

This Buddhist organization, sponsored by the royal family, stated that the Chinese Central Government's suppression of a small number of bandits who betrayed the motherland, committed murder, arson, rape, and pillage was "an event that causes deep concern and seriously affects the feelings of all Buddhists." The group was saddened by the failure of the Tibetan rebels, and therefore, in the statement, requested that all Buddhists "show concern for those who are suffering, and hope that they can get out of their predicament as soon as possible," and called on Buddhists around the world to pray for the small number of Tibetan rebels: "May the God of Mercy drive away all improper persecution and the use of force to destroy humanity." The president of this Buddhist association, Darmasakti, said that this statement should be included in the agenda of the All-Thailand Buddhist Association Congress to be held from May 12 to 15, and that copies of the statement should be sent to eleven other Buddhist organizations in other countries.

    泰国佛教协会诬蔑我国
    竟为西藏叛匪祷告
    新华社3日讯  曼谷消息：泰国佛教协会在4月28日就西藏叛乱事件发表声明，恶毒诬蔑中国。
    这个由皇家赞助的佛教团体在它发表的声明中认为中国中央人民政府对少数叛变祖国、杀人放火、奸淫掳掠的少数叛匪的讨伐是“引起人们深切忧虑的事件并且对所有佛教徒的感情产生严重的影响”。这个团体为西藏叛乱分子的失败而伤心，因此，在声明中要求所有的佛教徒“对遭受不幸的人表示关心，并且渴望他们能够尽快地摆脱困境”，并且呼吁全世界佛教徒为西藏一小撮叛乱分子祷告：“愿慈悲之神驱走一切不正当的迫害和使用武力来毁灭人类的作法”。这个佛教协会会长达尔马萨克迪说，要把这个声明列入订于5月12日到15日举行的全泰国佛教协会大会的议程里，并且要把这个声明的副本送给其他国家的十一个佛教团体。
