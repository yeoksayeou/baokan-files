Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 24th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report today, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission on May 20th, protesting that the United States has illegally shipped weapons and war materials into South Vietnam 375 times.

　　The letter states that from May 1955 to April 24, 1959, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army sent 125 letters to the International Commission, protesting the United States' shipment of the aforementioned weapons and war materials into South Vietnam, in violation of Article 17 of the Geneva Accords.

　　The letter points out that in the last four months of 1954, the United States shipped weapons and war materials into South Vietnam five times; in 1955, fifteen times; in 1956, eighty-two times; in 1957, one hundred and nine times; in 1958, one hundred and fourteen times; and in the first three months of 1959, according to incomplete statistics, fifty times. From the above, it can be seen that the United States' illegal shipment of weapons and war materials into South Vietnam is becoming increasingly intensified.

　　The letter states that, regrettably, in the above-mentioned 375 incidents, the International Commission has only concluded that the South Vietnamese authorities violated Article 17 of the Geneva Accords in five incidents to date.

　　The letter points out that the South Vietnamese authorities' illegal acts and non-cooperative attitude have caused enormous difficulties for the implementation of the Geneva Agreements. This situation is becoming increasingly serious, exacerbating the crisis that threatens peace and unity in Vietnam.

　　The letter concludes by stating that, based on the above, the People's Army Liaison Delegation hopes that the International Commission will pay attention to resolving the above-mentioned incidents in a timely and appropriate manner, and requests the International Commission to inform the delegation of the specific handling of each incident.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 24th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article today pointing out that U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are actively turning South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and are actively preparing for war.

　　The article said that the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) controls the formulation and execution of South Vietnam's military plans, becoming the supreme command of the South Vietnamese army. The number of personnel in this advisory group has increased from 200 at the time of the restoration of peace to 2,000, and has added military institutions and equipment renovation groups for the navy, army, air force, as well as staff, logistics, espionage, and inspection.

　　The article pointed out that from August 1954 to the end of 1958, forty-seven batches of U.S. military personnel, including the Deputy Secretaries of the U.S. Department of Defense, visited South Vietnam to inspect work or strengthen the U.S. MAAG.

　　The article said that under the direct direction of U.S. military advisors, South Vietnam had already established an army of 150,000 men, including the navy, army, and air force, by 1956. From August 1, 1957 to the present, the South Vietnamese authorities have established ten more divisions. In addition, South Vietnam's so-called "Security Corps" has increased to 60,000 men. The so-called "Civil Guard" has also increased to 100,000 men.

　　The article pointed out that before the restoration of peace, South Vietnam had only six military airfields, but now it has increased to sixteen. At the same time, they are accelerating the construction of ports such as Nha Trang, Tu Lon, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh, and Qui Nhon into modern military ports, and are preparing to establish a submarine base in Cam Ranh Bay. The U.S.-Ngo clique is opening up a series of strategic highways and their branches. They are also preparing to open a strategic highway from Qui Nhon to North Laos in order to connect South Vietnam and Thailand's strategic highways into a system through Laos. At the same time, the U.S.-Ngo clique is also stepping up the establishment of military bases called "Land Reclamation Zones."

    越南人民军总部联络代表团函国际委员会
    抗议美国不断非法往南越运军火
    新华社河内24日电  据越南通讯社今天报道：越南人民军总司令部联络代表团5月20日写信给国际委员会，抗议美国已三百七十五次把武器和作战物资非法运入南越。
    信里说，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团从1955年5月到1959年4月24日曾经写了一百二十五封信给国际委员会，抗议美国把上述武器和战争物资运入南越，违反了日内瓦协定第十七条。
    信里指出：1954年最后的四个月中，美国曾五次把武器和作战物资运入南越；1955年运进了十五次；1956年运进八十二次；1957年一百零九次；1958年一百一十四次；1959年最初三个月中，据不完全统计，已经有五十次。从上面的情况可以看出，美国把武器和作战物资非法运入南越的行为愈来愈加剧。
    信里说，遗憾的是，在上述三百七十五起事件中，国际委员会直到现在只对五起事件作出结论说是南越当局违反了日内瓦协定第十七条。
    信里指出，由于南越当局的违法行为和不合作态度，使日内瓦协议的履行碰到莫大的困难。这种情况愈来愈严重，加剧了威胁越南的和平和统一的危机。
    信里最后说，根据上述情况，人民军联络代表团希望国际委员会注意及时地、适当地解决上述事件，并要求国际委员会使代表团知道对每一起事件的具体处理情况。
    新华社河内24日电  越南“人民报”今天发表文章指出，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团正在积极地把南越变成美国的军事基地并且积极准备战争。
    文章说，美国军事顾问团操纵了南越军事计划的制订和执行，成为南越军队的最高指挥部。这个顾问团的人数已从和平恢复时的二百名增加到二千名，并增设了海、陆、空军以及参谋、后勤、间谍、检查等军事机构和装备翻新团。
    文章指出，从1954年8月到1958年底，有四十七批包括有美国国防部正副部长的美国军事人员到南越视察工作或加强美国军事顾问团。
    文章说，在美国军事顾问的直接指使下，南越在1956年就已经建立了包括海、陆、空军的十五万名军队。从1957年8月1日到现在，南越当局又成立了十个师。此外，南越的所谓“保安团”也增加到六万人。所谓“民卫队”也增加到十万人。
    文章指出，和平恢复以前，南越只有六个军用机场，现在已增加到十六个。同时，他们正在加紧把牙?、土伦、芽庄、甘宁、归仁等港口建成现代化军港，并准备在寒开湾设立潜水艇基地。美吴集团正在开辟一系列的战略公路和它的支线，他们还准备从归仁到老挝北车开辟一条战略公路以便通过老挝把南越和泰国的战略公路连接成一个系统。与此同时，美吴集团还正在加紧建立名为“垦荒区”的军事基地。
