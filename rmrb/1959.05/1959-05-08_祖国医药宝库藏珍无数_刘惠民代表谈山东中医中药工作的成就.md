The Treasure Trove of Traditional Chinese Medicine Holds Countless Gems
Representative Liu Huimin Discusses the Achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbal Medicine Work in Shandong

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports have given me great inspiration and education, and have made me even more aware of the correctness and greatness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Now I will report to the Congress on the implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine in Shandong Province in recent years.

In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine in Shandong Province has achieved great success due to the implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. The political and economic status of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has been improved and improved. In particular, after the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the political ideology of the majority of medical personnel has been universally improved, which has greatly enhanced their initiative and creativity in their work. In the past few years, they have played a role in rescuing and controlling climatic diseases and infectious diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, encephalitis, and infantile paralysis, which further illustrates that the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine is not only rich and colorful in content, but also catches up with or surpasses the world's medical science level in the treatment of some difficult diseases. For example, more than 30 kinds of diseases, such as appendicitis, bladder stones, and kidney stones, which were previously considered to require surgery, can now be cured by taking traditional Chinese medicine or acupuncture. This has greatly promoted the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Up to now, eight traditional Chinese medicine hospitals have been established in the province, with 333 beds. General hospitals at all levels have generally established traditional Chinese medicine departments or traditional Chinese medicine divisions. In particular, most of the people's commune hospitals and health stations in the province rely on traditional Chinese medicine personnel. They have played a great role in ensuring the health of commune members and completing industrial and agricultural production plans. There are now 1,889 traditional Chinese medicine personnel who have been absorbed into public medical institutions.

In terms of the training and education of traditional Chinese medicine personnel, there are already seven traditional Chinese medicine schools in the province, which have enrolled more than 520 new students, with a graduation period of four to six years. In teaching methods, the educational policy of combining education with productive labor has been resolutely implemented. In terms of curriculum, not only are there traditional Chinese medicine system courses, but also certain physiology, anatomy, pharmacology, physics, chemistry, classical literature, and related foreign language courses are arranged, which lays the foundation for cultivating new types of medical science talents in my country. In addition, more than 10 advanced study schools have been established in our province, training 349 teachers of traditional Chinese medicine and more than 6,600 traditional Chinese medicine personnel for advanced study, accounting for about a quarter of the total number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the province. At the same time, off-the-job classes for Western medicine practitioners to learn traditional Chinese medicine have been opened, and 138 senior Western medicine practitioners have formally participated in the study. In-service study by medical personnel is based on personal willingness to use spare time or combine it with clinical study. A learning upsurge has been set off throughout the province, and it is done as you learn and use. For example, many hospitals use acupuncture and massage methods instead of painkillers and local anesthetics. In terms of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking apprentices, according to incomplete statistics from the province, there are already 3,553. The learning method is based on self-study, collective research, supplemented by guidance, and combined with oral instruction, with a term of two to five years. There is also an amateur Red and Expert University of Traditional Chinese Medicine that is being planned.

In terms of research work, there are already 14 traditional Chinese medicine research institutes (groups) in the province, which have clinically cured more than 100 kinds of intractable diseases, including rheumatic heart disease, severe neurasthenia (including epilepsy), Brucella disease, typhoid fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver, infectious hepatitis in children, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (kidney atrophy), gynecological dysmenorrhea, infertility, infantile paralysis, sequelae of type B encephalitis, and various ophthalmic diseases, etc. In addition, the orthopedics department has also made great achievements in the treatment of fractures in factories and mines. In terms of drug research, a batch of health-care pills, brain-boosting juice, Fede Ning, Fuyou Dan, filarial pills, Xuede Ping and other more than 10 kinds of patent medicines with higher curative effects and other dosage form improvements have been created. However, caution has been taken in improving dosage forms. In terms of literature arrangement, more than 20 kinds of "Vernacular Explanation of the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine," "On Treatise on Febrile Diseases," "A Brief Explanation of 150 Flavors of Materia Medica," "Compilation of Medical Prescriptions of People's Communes," and "Prevention and Treatment Methods of Measles and Pneumonia" have been compiled and written, and there are also more than 10 kinds that are being planned to be written. In terms of technical innovation and invention, our province is testing the research work of "electronic pulse diagnostic instrument" and other scientific instruments that help clinical diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine.

The production and purchase of Chinese herbal medicines has also greatly developed. In 1958, the purchase volume of Chinese herbal medicines in the province increased by nearly 7.5 times compared with 1957.

In addition, in order to summarize experience, the Provincial Health Department, under the leadership of the Party, is preparing a "Shandong Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Exhibition Hall," which is divided into five halls, summarizing some of the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine in the province in recent years. The content is rich and colorful and will be exhibited soon.

In short, in recent years, the work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine has achieved certain results under the leadership of the Party, but these results are still far from the requirements of the Central Committee, and are still lagging behind compared with other provinces. However, we have the confidence and determination to go all out and strive for the top. In 1959, we will, in accordance with Premier Zhou's instructions on health work: "We should unite traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, organize them to jointly serve the people's health undertakings, jointly carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and develop medical science," vigorously carry out the mass movement to study the policies on traditional Chinese medicine and promote the policies on traditional Chinese medicine, mobilize all medical and health personnel, use their spare time, and combine clinical practice to universally study traditional Chinese medicine, and carry out a mass movement to collect folk prescriptions from talented people and sages, collect and excavate effective prescriptions and secret prescriptions circulating among the people, identify them and then promote their application. Vigorously carry out the research work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine. Organize traditional Chinese medicine review classes and train new forces of traditional Chinese medicine. This year, it is planned to systematically establish a traditional Chinese medicine research network throughout the province. The key research content in 1959 will focus on the central government's instructions to eliminate major diseases, focusing on filariasis, hookworm disease, leprosy, epidemic encephalitis B, goiter, tetanus, cancer, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, diabetes, nephritis, silicosis, lead and benzene poisoning and other diseases, and set up several special research groups. In the work of rescuing the experience of elderly traditional Chinese medicine personnel, widely carry out the work of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking apprentices, and in an organized way, transfer a group of young Western medicine practitioners to be apprentices to elderly traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. At the same time, elderly traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with special expertise are invited to relevant medical units to conduct short-term or long-term special research work according to their voluntary principles, so that their academic experience can be quickly inherited. For example, Mr. Liu Bairong, an elderly gentleman who is hired by the Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine to perform Jinzhen Boyi, and an old woman who is hired by the Laiyang County Health Hospital to treat tetanus, etc. In terms of Chinese herbal medicine, vigorously launch a mass movement for the production of Chinese herbal medicine, and strive to ensure that the output of medicinal materials this year does not run out of stock. The Shandong Provincial People's Committee has decided to plant 374,217 mu of various Chinese herbal medicines throughout the province this year, with an annual output of 3.48 million catties, an increase of 6.4 times compared with 1958. Medical colleges at all levels generally plant Chinese herbal medicine experimental fields, and cities, special districts, counties, pharmaceutical companies, and medical colleges at all levels with conditions generally establish Chinese medicine manufacturing plants, implementing a combination of large, medium, and small, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and solving the shortage of drug manufacturing and supply.

In order to do a good job in the work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine in 1959 and better serve industrial and agricultural production, we must absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, implement the principle of putting politics in command, continue ideological transformation, strengthen the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and implement the policy of walking on two legs, so that my country's medical treasure house can be further developed and a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in health work can be realized.

Finally, let us Chinese and Western medical workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the newly elected national leaders, under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, unite closely, cooperate with each other, mobilize all positive forces, jointly carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, raise our country's inherent medical science to the level of modern medical science, work hard for the new medicine of the motherland, and jointly strive to serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

I will make a joint statement with Representative Ding Lude and others on the Tibet issue, so I will not discuss it here. Please correct any inappropriate points in my speech.

I wish all leaders and representatives good health.
