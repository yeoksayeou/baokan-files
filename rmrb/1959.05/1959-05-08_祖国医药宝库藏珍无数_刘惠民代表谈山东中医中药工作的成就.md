The Treasure Trove of Traditional Chinese Medicine Holds Countless Gems
Representative Liu Huimin Discusses the Achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbal Medicine Work in Shandong

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports have given me great inspiration and education, and have made me even more aware of the correctness and greatness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Now I will report to the Congress on the implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine in Shandong Province in recent years.

In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, the work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine in Shandong Province has achieved great success due to the implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine. The political and economic status of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has been improved and improved. In particular, after the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the political ideology of the majority of medical personnel has been universally improved, which has greatly enhanced their initiative and creativity in their work. In the past few years, they have played a role in rescuing and controlling climatic diseases and infectious diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, encephalitis, and infantile paralysis, which further illustrates that the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine is not only rich and colorful in content, but also catches up with or surpasses the world's medical science level in the treatment of some difficult diseases. For example, more than 30 kinds of diseases, such as appendicitis, bladder stones, and kidney stones, which were previously considered to require surgery, can now be cured by taking traditional Chinese medicine or acupuncture. This has greatly promoted the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Up to now, eight traditional Chinese medicine hospitals have been established in the province, with 333 beds. General hospitals at all levels have generally established traditional Chinese medicine departments or traditional Chinese medicine divisions. In particular, most of the people's commune hospitals and health stations in the province rely on traditional Chinese medicine personnel. They have played a great role in ensuring the health of commune members and completing industrial and agricultural production plans. There are now 1,889 traditional Chinese medicine personnel who have been absorbed into public medical institutions.

In terms of the training and education of traditional Chinese medicine personnel, there are already seven traditional Chinese medicine schools in the province, which have enrolled more than 520 new students, with a graduation period of four to six years. In teaching methods, the educational policy of combining education with productive labor has been resolutely implemented. In terms of curriculum, not only are there traditional Chinese medicine system courses, but also certain physiology, anatomy, pharmacology, physics, chemistry, classical literature, and related foreign language courses are arranged, which lays the foundation for cultivating new types of medical science talents in my country. In addition, more than 10 advanced study schools have been established in our province, training 349 teachers of traditional Chinese medicine and more than 6,600 traditional Chinese medicine personnel for advanced study, accounting for about a quarter of the total number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the province. At the same time, off-the-job classes for Western medicine practitioners to learn traditional Chinese medicine have been opened, and 138 senior Western medicine practitioners have formally participated in the study. In-service study by medical personnel is based on personal willingness to use spare time or combine it with clinical study. A learning upsurge has been set off throughout the province, and it is done as you learn and use. For example, many hospitals use acupuncture and massage methods instead of painkillers and local anesthetics. In terms of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking apprentices, according to incomplete statistics from the province, there are already 3,553. The learning method is based on self-study, collective research, supplemented by guidance, and combined with oral instruction, with a term of two to five years. There is also an amateur Red and Expert University of Traditional Chinese Medicine that is being planned.

In terms of research work, there are already 14 traditional Chinese medicine research institutes (groups) in the province, which have clinically cured more than 100 kinds of intractable diseases, including rheumatic heart disease, severe neurasthenia (including epilepsy), Brucella disease, typhoid fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver, infectious hepatitis in children, Guillain-Barré syndrome (kidney atrophy), gynecological dysmenorrhea, infertility, infantile paralysis, sequelae of type B encephalitis, and various ophthalmic diseases, etc. In addition, the orthopedics department has also made great achievements in the treatment of fractures in factories and mines. In terms of drug research, a batch of health-care pills, brain-boosting juice, Fede Ning, Fuyou Dan, filarial pills, Xuede Ping and other more than 10 kinds of patent medicines with higher curative effects and other dosage form improvements have been created. However, caution has been taken in improving dosage forms. In terms of literature arrangement, more than 20 kinds of "Vernacular Explanation of the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine," "On Treatise on Febrile Diseases," "A Brief Explanation of 150 Flavors of Materia Medica," "Compilation of Medical Prescriptions of People's Communes," and "Prevention and Treatment Methods of Measles and Pneumonia" have been compiled and written, and there are also more than 10 kinds that are being planned to be written. In terms of technical innovation and invention, our province is testing the research work of "electronic pulse diagnostic instrument" and other scientific instruments that help clinical diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine.

The production and purchase of Chinese herbal medicines has also greatly developed. In 1958, the purchase volume of Chinese herbal medicines in the province increased by nearly 7.5 times compared with 1957.

In addition, in order to summarize experience, the Provincial Health Department, under the leadership of the Party, is preparing a "Shandong Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Exhibition Hall," which is divided into five halls, summarizing some of the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine in the province in recent years. The content is rich and colorful and will be exhibited soon.

In short, in recent years, the work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine has achieved certain results under the leadership of the Party, but these results are still far from the requirements of the Central Committee, and are still lagging behind compared with other provinces. However, we have the confidence and determination to go all out and strive for the top. In 1959, we will, in accordance with Premier Zhou's instructions on health work: "We should unite traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, organize them to jointly serve the people's health undertakings, jointly carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and develop medical science," vigorously carry out the mass movement to study the policies on traditional Chinese medicine and promote the policies on traditional Chinese medicine, mobilize all medical and health personnel, use their spare time, and combine clinical practice to universally study traditional Chinese medicine, and carry out a mass movement to collect folk prescriptions from talented people and sages, collect and excavate effective prescriptions and secret prescriptions circulating among the people, identify them and then promote their application. Vigorously carry out the research work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine. Organize traditional Chinese medicine review classes and train new forces of traditional Chinese medicine. This year, it is planned to systematically establish a traditional Chinese medicine research network throughout the province. The key research content in 1959 will focus on the central government's instructions to eliminate major diseases, focusing on filariasis, hookworm disease, leprosy, epidemic encephalitis B, goiter, tetanus, cancer, high blood pressure, cirrhosis, diabetes, nephritis, silicosis, lead and benzene poisoning and other diseases, and set up several special research groups. In the work of rescuing the experience of elderly traditional Chinese medicine personnel, widely carry out the work of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners taking apprentices, and in an organized way, transfer a group of young Western medicine practitioners to be apprentices to elderly traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. At the same time, elderly traditional Chinese medicine practitioners with special expertise are invited to relevant medical units to conduct short-term or long-term special research work according to their voluntary principles, so that their academic experience can be quickly inherited. For example, Mr. Liu Bairong, an elderly gentleman who is hired by the Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine to perform Jinzhen Boyi, and an old woman who is hired by the Laiyang County Health Hospital to treat tetanus, etc. In terms of Chinese herbal medicine, vigorously launch a mass movement for the production of Chinese herbal medicine, and strive to ensure that the output of medicinal materials this year does not run out of stock. The Shandong Provincial People's Committee has decided to plant 374,217 mu of various Chinese herbal medicines throughout the province this year, with an annual output of 3.48 million catties, an increase of 6.4 times compared with 1958. Medical colleges at all levels generally plant Chinese herbal medicine experimental fields, and cities, special districts, counties, pharmaceutical companies, and medical colleges at all levels with conditions generally establish Chinese medicine manufacturing plants, implementing a combination of large, medium, and small, combining foreign and indigenous methods, and solving the shortage of drug manufacturing and supply.

In order to do a good job in the work of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine in 1959 and better serve industrial and agricultural production, we must absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, implement the principle of putting politics in command, continue ideological transformation, strengthen the unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and implement the policy of walking on two legs, so that my country's medical treasure house can be further developed and a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in health work can be realized.

Finally, let us Chinese and Western medical workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the newly elected national leaders, under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, unite closely, cooperate with each other, mobilize all positive forces, jointly carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, raise our country's inherent medical science to the level of modern medical science, work hard for the new medicine of the motherland, and jointly strive to serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

I will make a joint statement with Representative Ding Lude and others on the Tibet issue, so I will not discuss it here. Please correct any inappropriate points in my speech.

I wish all leaders and representatives good health.

　　祖国医药宝库藏珍无数
    刘惠民代表谈山东中医中药工作的成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。这些报告，给了我极大的启发教育和鼓舞，更加体会到党中央和毛主席领导的正确和伟大。现在我把山东省几年来贯彻党的中医政策的情况，向代表大会汇报一下。
    几年来，山东省的中医中药工作，在党中央和毛主席及山东省委的正确领导下，由于贯彻了党的中医政策，因而获得了很大的成绩，中医的政治地位和经济地位，都得到了提高和改善，特别是经过整风反右派斗争，广大医务人员的政治思想，普遍的有了提高，这就大大发挥了他们在工作上的主动性和创造性，在几年来对气候病传染病如麻疹、伤寒、大脑炎、婴儿瘫等起到了抢救与控制的作用，这也进一步说明祖国医学遗产不仅在内容上丰富多彩，并且对某些疑难病的治疗上，赶上或超过了世界医学科学水平。例如过去一向认为必须用开刀手术治疗的阑尾炎，膀胱结石、肾结石等三十余种疾病，现在用服中药或针灸的办法即可治愈，这样就大大促进了中西医的团结合作。截止目前全省已建立中医院八处、病床三百三十三张。各级综合医院，普遍的建立了中医科或中医部，特别是全省人民公社医院和保健站，大部分力量依靠中医人员，他们对保证社员的身体健康，完成工农业生产计划，起到了很大的作用。现在被吸收到公立医疗机构的中医中药人员已有一千八百八十九名。
    在中医人员培养教育方面，全省已有中医院校七处，招收了新生五百二十余人，毕业年限是四年到六年。在教学方法上坚决贯彻了教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。在课程安排上，不仅有中医体系课程，并且也安排了一定的生理、解剖、药理、物理、化学、古典文学、和有关的外文等课程，这就为培养我国新型的医学科学人才打下了基础。另外，我省建立了进修学校十余处，培养中医师资三百四十九名，进修中医人员六千六百余人，约占全省中医总人数四分之一。同时开办了西医学习中医的脱产班，现已有一百三十八名高年级西医正式参加了学习。医务人员的在职学习，根据本人自愿利用业余或结合临床学习，已在全省掀起了学习热潮，并作到随学随用，例如有许多医院采用针灸和按摩等办法代替止痛和局部麻醉的药物。在中医带徒弟方面，全省不完全的统计，已有三千五百五十三名，在学习方法上，是以自学为主，集体研究，加以辅导，并和口传心授相结合，年限有两年到五年不等。还有中医业余红专大学正在筹办中。
    在研究工作方面，全省已有中医药研究所（组）十四处，在临床上治愈了一百余种疑难疾病，包括风湿性的心脏病、高度神经衰弱（包括癫痫症）、布氏杆菌病、肠伤寒、肺结核、高血压、肝硬变、小儿传染性肝炎、格林巴利二氏综合症（肾痿症）、妇科痛经、不孕症、婴儿瘫、乙型脑炎后遗症以及各种眼科病，等等。另外正骨科对工矿骨折症的治疗上，也有很大的成绩。在药物研究方面，创制一批疗效较高的保健丹、补脑汁、肺得宁、福幼丹、丝虫丸、血得平等十余种成药，和其他剂型改进。但在改进剂型当中注意了谨慎从事。文献整理方面，编译和编写了“黄帝内经白话解”、“论伤寒论”、“本草百五十味浅释”、“人民公社医方汇编”、“麻疹和肺炎防治法”等二十余种，还有正在计划编写的十几种。在技术革新和创造发明方面，我省正在试制“电子诊脉仪”和其他有助中医临床诊断的科学仪器的研究工作。
    中药材的生产和收购也有很大的发展，一九五八年全省中药材的收购量比一九五七年增加将近七倍半。
    另外，我们为了总结经验，最近省卫生厅在党的领导下，正筹备一个“山东省中医药展览馆”，内分五个馆，总结了全省祖国医药学上几年来的一些成就，内容是丰富多彩的，不日即要展出。
    总之几年来，中医中药工作在党的领导下取得了一定成绩，但这些成绩离中央对我们的要求还是很远的，与其他省比较还落在后面，但是我们有信心、有决心，鼓足干劲、力争上游。一九五九年我们将根据周总理关于卫生工作的指示精神：“应当团结中西医，组织他们共同为人民卫生事业服务，共同发扬祖国医学遗产和发展医学科学。”大力开展学习中医政策和宣传中医政策的群众运动，动员全体医药卫生人员，利用业余时间，结合临床业务，普遍的学习中医，开展群众性的采风访贤运动，把流传在民间的验方、秘方收集挖掘出来，经过鉴定再推广应用。大力开展中医药的研究工作。组织中医温课，培养中医的新生力量，今年拟在全省系统的建立中医研究网。一九五九年的重点研究内容围绕着中央消灭主要疾病的指示，以丝虫病、钩虫病、麻疯病、流行性乙型脑炎、甲状腺肿、破伤风、癌瘤、高血压、肝硬变、糖尿病、肾炎、矽肺、铅苯中毒等疾病，并成立若干专题研究小组。在抢救老年中医药人员的经验工作上，广泛的开展中医带徒弟，并有组织的调动一批青年西医给老年中医当徒弟，同时对有专科特长的老年中医，分别聘请到有关的医疗单位，根据其自愿的原则，作短时的或长时的专题研究工作，以便很快把他们的学术经验继承下来，例如目前省中医院聘请的金针拨翳的刘百荣老先生，掖县卫生院聘请祖传治破伤风的老大娘等。在中药方面大力开展一个群众性中药生产的运动，争取今年药材产量不脱销。山东省人民委员会，已决定今年全省种植各种中药材三十七万四千二百一十七亩，年产达到三百四十八万斤，比一九五八年增加产量六点四倍，各级医药院校，普遍的种植中药试验田，有条件的市、专、县、药材公司和各级医药院校，普遍建立中药制造厂，实行大、中、小结合，洋土并举，解决药品的制造和供应的不足。
    为了做好一九五九年中医中药工作，更好的为工农业生产服务，必须绝对服从党的领导，实行政治挂帅，继续进行思想改造，加强中西医的团结合作，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，使我国的医药宝库得到进一步发展，实现卫生工作更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    最后让我们中西医务工作者，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下和新选出的国家领导人领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多、快、好、省地建设社会主义总路线的指导下，亲密团结起来，相互协作，动员一切积极力量，共同发扬祖国医学遗产，把我国固有的医学科学，提高到现代医学科学水平，为祖国的新医学而努力，共同为祖国社会主义建设服务而奋斗。
    关于西藏问题我另和丁履德代表等联合发言，在这里就不谈了。我的发言如有不妥之处请各位代表予以指正。
    敬祝各位首长和各位代表身体健康。
