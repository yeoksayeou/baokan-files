Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: Religious figures from all over the country have unanimously condemned the actions of imperialist and Indian expansionist elements in interfering in China's internal affairs. They pointed out that Tibetan rebel elements, under the guise of religion, are engaged in treacherous activities against the motherland, and that imperialist and Indian expansionist elements are interfering in China's internal affairs under the guise of so-called "religious feelings." All patriotic believers in the country will never allow their conspiracy to succeed.

The famous Tibetan religious figure, Khejue Khenpo Jampel Tsering, said: The imperialist rumor that the Central People's Government is "destroying religion" in Tibet is something only devils would believe. Every lama with a conscience can testify that the People's Liberation Army and Han cadres protect temples and respect religion. The Central People's Government provides alms to the vast number of lamas every year and sends doctors to the temples to treat lamas free of charge. Poor lamas have also received relief. The Central People's Government has also allocated funds to help us renovate some dilapidated monasteries. The People's Liberation Army and Han personnel do not believe in religion, but when they enter the temples, they do not even smoke, and they respect our Buddhist rules very much. I ask the Indian expansionist elements, can these facts be called "destroying religion"? Jampel Tsering also said: "A small group of jackals in cassocks, who were engaged in rebellion, have now run away with their tails between their legs. Perhaps this is the basis for 'destroying religion'! But if you ask 99% of the lamas, they will all clap their hands and applaud. Shakyamuni repeatedly warned us to do more good deeds and not to kill. However, the rebel elements, wearing cassocks, raped, burned, killed, and harmed the people. They are not qualified to be called lamas. They are the enemies of the people and the scum of Lamaism. According to Buddhist rules, they should be punished."

Buddhist figures in other places also listed many facts to refute the rumors and slanders spread by imperialist and Indian expansionist elements against our country. Kuanlin, Vice President of the Chengdu Buddhist Association and Abbot of Wenshu Monastery, said: If the rumor-mongers are Buddhists, they have first committed the "groundless slander" in the Buddhist precepts. The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have always protected freedom of religious belief. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army sacrificed eight soldiers to help the monks of Guangsheng Temple in Zhaocheng County, Shanxi Province, rescue a "Tripitaka" from the Japanese army. Many Buddhists still admire and remember this. After liberation, the People's Government has done even more immeasurable good deeds in protecting religious beliefs. The Tang Dynasty stone carvings in Fangshan had never been printed before. Last year, the People's Government assisted the Buddhist Association of China in printing this precious scripture. These things have not only benefited religious figures in China, but also have been praised by many upright religious figures from foreign countries. Kuanlin said that after liberation, religious figures from India, Indonesia and other countries visited Wenshu Monastery and believed that our religious beliefs were protected. Kuanlin finally warned the imperialist and Indian expansionist elements that the Chinese people would never allow you to interfere in our internal affairs under the guise of religion. Lin Qing, a lama from Wusutu Zhao Monastery in Hohhot, said that our monastery was originally without windows and doors and in a dilapidated state before liberation. After liberation, the People's Government allocated funds to help us renovate it, and we lamas have also been taken care of by the government. These facts prove that the rumors of foreign interventionists are worthless. Wu Gula, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China and President of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Branch of the Buddhist Association, said that in 1956, after I returned to Yunnan from a meeting convened by the Buddhist Association of China in Beijing, I was alone on the road and could not speak Chinese well, but the People's Government was very concerned about me and called the relevant departments along the way from Beijing to take care of me. When I was anxious to transfer to a bus in Jinchengjiang to buy a bus ticket, several PLA soldiers saw me and hurried to greet me, enthusiastically buying tickets and arranging accommodation for me. He warned the Indian expansionist elements that your fabrication of rumors and slanders can only arouse our anger, and you will get nothing else. Mingzhen, President of the Changsha Buddhist Association, who is participating in the revision of the Hunan Provincial Chronicle in Changsha, denounced the foreign interventionists' shameless slander that "Communist China has no religious freedom." He said: "The sun cannot be covered, and the facts cannot be denied. Only in New China is there true religious freedom. Let this small group of reactionaries chant their incantations, one day, these incantations will turn into their own dirge." At a forum of religious figures in Chongqing, Shi Taikong, President of the Chongqing Buddhist Association, said: I lived in the Tibetan area for seventeen years and went to the Shannan area. I saw with my own eyes that the people in the rich Shannan area lived a very painful life under the rule of the upper-class reactionary elements. The People's Liberation Army quickly suppressed the bandits in the Shannan area, enabling the people there to be reborn. This should have been a happy thing for people. However, the Indian expansionist elements are sad about this. What are their intentions? It is a self-confession.

Buddhist figures in various places were extremely angry at the Indian expansionist elements' interference in China's internal affairs. Lin Zhen, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of Wutai Mountain, a Buddhist holy site in Shanxi Province, said: It is absurd for the Indian expansionist elements to describe Tibet as a country. I want to ask these ambitious people, if Tibet becomes another country because the Tibetan people are Tibetan, then there are more than forty ethnic groups in China. Can they become more than forty countries? There are also some ethnic minorities in India. If others call the ethnic minorities in your country countries, would you agree? Ciqing, President of the Chengdu Buddhist Association and Abbot of Zhaojue Temple, who had studied Buddhism in Tibet for six years, said that Tibet has always been a part of our country's territory. The so-called "Tibetan independence" is a trick played by British imperialism in an attempt to invade Tibet. Now the Indian expansionist elements have inherited the mantle of British imperialism and are clamoring for "Tibetan independence" in an attempt to split China. In front of the Chinese people who have already stood up, this kind of conspiracy is completely futile. Han Dazai, Vice President of the Wuhan Buddhist Association, said at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Political Consultative Conference that we, all Buddhist believers, cannot tolerate the provocative behavior of the Indian expansionist elements who insulted the statue of our country's leader. Wei Fang, Vice President of the Shanghai Buddhist Association and Abbot of Jade Buddha Temple, said that the Indian expansionist elements' blatant interference in our internal affairs by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion and attempting to undermine our country's unity is a conspiracy that is bound to be completely bankrupt. Shi Jiecheng, a 63-year-old director of the Buddhist Association of China, said at a forum of religious figures in Yinchuan that after seeing the photos of the Tibetan rebel elements raping, killing, looting, cutting open their bellies, and gouging out their hearts in the newspapers, any person with a conscience cannot help but feel outraged. A small group of reactionary elements in Tibet are using the guise of "protecting religion," but in reality, they are jackals in religious clothing who harm the people. The Indian expansionist elements support these people. They collude with these people and attempt to undermine our country's unity and ethnic solidarity. We will never allow it.

Islamic figures in various places also unanimously condemned the imperialist and Indian expansionist elements for interfering in China's internal affairs. Ma Zhendong, Director of the Islamic Association of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, said that the Indian expansionist elements have distorted the facts, reversed black and white, and openly interfered in our internal affairs. This behavior makes me very angry. The Chinese people have always loved peace and resolutely implemented a peaceful foreign policy. We never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, but we will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. I hope the Indian expansionist elements will calm down. Yang Peizhi, the 77-year-old Imam of the Chengdu Islamic Church, said: I have been a priest for more than 40 years and have suffered a lot from the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. They arbitrarily occupied churches and took things from mosques. After liberation, the People's Government truly protected freedom of religious belief. The shameless slanders of the Indian expansionist elements and the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet can only expose their sinister motives to split our country's unity and permanently enslave the Tibetan people. Islamic figures in Chongqing held a forum on the 28th. The people who attended the meeting unanimously angrily condemned the imperialist and Indian expansionist elements for interfering in our internal affairs and adopted a letter of protest, strongly protesting the provocative behavior of the Bombay police authorities in condoning thugs to insult the statue of Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country.

Christian, Catholic, and Taoist figures in many places also held forums. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Christian Churches in China and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Christian Churches in Shanghai held a forum on the 28th. The people who attended the meeting unanimously pointed out that in New China we enjoy complete freedom of religious belief, but the Tibetan rebel elements, under the guise of religion, are committing crimes that are absolutely contrary to religious doctrines, such as raping, looting, gouging out people's hearts, and skinning people. They are simply beasts. The imperialist and Indian expansionist elements say that our country has no freedom of religious belief, which is completely a fabrication and slander. Shanghai Catholics Zhang Shirang, Tang Lidao, Lu Weidu, Chen Fumin and others also unanimously opposed the despicable means of the Vatican, an imperialist tool, in interfering in our internal affairs under the guise of religion after the Tibetan rebellion. Xiong Zhenpei, Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Christian Churches in Guangdong Province, condemned the crimes of foreign interventionists at a forum and warned the Indian expansionist elements that the Chinese people would never allow anyone to undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. Han Renquan, Director of the Chinese Taoist Association and Supervisor of the Jintian Temple in Lanzhou, said: Our great leader will never allow anyone to insult him. The Indian expansionist elements' insult to our country's leader is to be enemies with 600 million Chinese people. (Attached picture)

In recent days, Buddhist figures in Chongqing have held meetings one after another to angrily condemn the imperialist and Indian expansionist elements for carrying out conspiracies to interfere in our internal affairs under the cover of religious cloaks.

    所谓“宗教感情”可以休矣
    各地宗教界人士严斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政
    新华社2日讯　全国各地的宗教界人士一致谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的行为。他们指出，西藏叛乱分子披着宗教外衣进行背叛祖国的勾当，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子在所谓“宗教感情”的幌子下干涉我国内政，全国所有爱国教徒决不容许他们的阴谋得逞。
    西藏著名宗教家结巴堪苏·坚白慈里说：帝国主义造谣说中央人民政府在西藏“破坏宗教”，这只有魔鬼才会相信。每个有良心的喇嘛都可以证明人民解放军和汉族干部是保护寺庙，尊重宗教的。中央人民政府每年给广大喇嘛发放布施，派医生到寺庙免费为喇嘛治病，穷苦喇嘛还得到了救济。中央人民政府还拨款帮助我们整修了一些破旧寺院。人民解放军和汉族工作人员并不信教，但当他们走进寺院时，连纸烟都不吸，非常尊重我们佛教教规。试问印度扩张主义分子，这些事实能说是“破坏宗教”吗？坚白慈里还说：“有一小撮披着袈裟进行叛乱的豺狼们，这次夹着尾巴逃跑了。也许这就是‘破坏宗教’的根据吧！可是你问问99％的喇嘛，他们一个个却拍掌称快。释迦佛一再告诫我们，要多行善事，不许杀生，叛乱分子却身披袈裟奸淫烧杀，残害人民。他们已经没有资格叫做喇嘛，他们是人民的敌人，是喇嘛教的败类。按照佛规，他们应该受到惩罚。”
    其他各地的佛教界人士也列举许多事实，驳斥帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子对我国的造谣诬蔑。成都市佛教协会副会长、文殊院方丈宽霖说：造谣的人如果是佛教徒，他首先就犯了佛诫中的“无根谤”。共产党和解放军一贯保护宗教信仰自由。抗日战争期间，八路军为帮助山西赵城县广胜寺和尚从日本军队手里抢救一部“大藏经”，牺牲了八个战士，许多佛教徒至今还感佩不忘。解放后，人民政府在保护宗教信仰方面更做了许多功德无量的事。房山唐代石刻经书是从没有印行过的，去年人民政府协助中国佛教协会把这部宝贵经卷印了出来。这些事不仅中国宗教界人士身受其惠，许多外国正直的宗教界人士也称道不置。宽霖说，解放后，印度、印度尼西亚等国宗教界人士曾到文殊院参观，都认为我们的宗教信仰是得到保护的。宽霖最后警告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子说，中国人民决不容许你们假借宗教名义来干涉我国内政。呼和浩特市乌素图召喇嘛林庆说，我们这个召庙，解放前原来少窗无门、破烂不堪。解放以后，人民政府拨款帮助我们修缮一新，我们喇嘛也受到政府的照顾。这些事实，都证明外国干涉者的造谣是一文不值的。中国佛教协会副会长、佛教协会德宏傣族景颇族自治州分会会长傣族大长老伍古腊说，1956年我从北京开完中国佛教协会召集的会议回云南，路上只我单身一人，汉话又讲不好，但是人民政府非常关怀我，从北京打电话给沿途有关部门照应我。在金城江要转车买汽车票，我正在焦急的时候，几位解放军战士见了赶忙主动招呼我，热情地给我买票和安排宿处。他警告印度扩张主义分子说，你们凭空造谣诬蔑，只能激起我们的愤怒，除此而外是什么也得不到的。正在长沙市参加修编湖南省志工作的长沙佛教协会会长明真法师痛斥外国干涉者污蔑“共产党中国没有宗教信仰自由”的无耻谰言。他说：“太阳是掩盖不住的，事实是抹煞不了的，只有在新中国，才有真正的宗教自由。让他们这一小撮反动派去喃喃地念咒语吧，总有一天，这些咒语会变成他们自己的挽歌。”在重庆市宗教界人士的座谈会上，重庆市佛教协会会长释太空说：我曾在西藏地区生活十七年，并到过山南地区，亲眼看到富饶的山南地区人民在上层反动分子统治下，过着非常痛苦的生活。人民解放军迅速剿平山南地区叛匪，使那里的人民得到了新生，这本是值得人们高兴的一件事。可是印度扩张主义分子却为此悲哀，其居心何在，真是不打自招。
    各地佛教界人士对印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的行为都极为愤怒。佛教圣地——山西省五台山佛教协会副会长林镇说：印度扩张主义分子把我国西藏说成是一个国家，真是荒谬绝伦。我要问问这些野心家们，如果说因为西藏人民是藏族就成了另一个国家的话，那么全中国有四十多个民族，还能成了四十多个国家？印度也有一些少数民族，如果别人把你们国家内的少数民族也称为国家，你们会同意吗？成都市佛教协会会长、曾在西藏研究佛学达六年之久的昭觉寺方丈慈青说，西藏历来就是我国领土的一部分。所谓“西藏独立”，是英帝国主义企图侵略西藏而耍出来的花招。现在印度扩张分子继承了英帝国主义的衣钵，又在叫嚷“西藏独立”，企图分裂中国。在已经站起来了的中国人民面前，这种阴谋诡计完全是枉费心机。武汉市佛教协会副会长韩大载在政协武汉市常委扩大会议上说，印度扩张主义分子污辱我国领袖像的挑衅行为，我们全体佛教教徒决不能容忍。上海市佛教协会副会长、玉佛寺主持苇舫法师说，印度扩张主义分子利用西藏叛乱事件粗暴地干涉我国内政，企图破坏我国的统一，这种阴谋是一定要彻底破产的。六十三岁的中国佛教协会理事释戒成在银川市宗教界人士座谈会上说，看了报上刊登的西藏叛乱分子奸淫、烧杀、抢劫、割腹、挖心等罪行的照片，任何有良心的人都不能不感到发指。西藏一小撮反动分子打着
  “保护宗教”的幌子，实际上是披着宗教外衣残害人民的豺狼。印度扩张主义分子所支持的就是这些人。他们和这些人狼狈为奸，妄图破坏我国统一和民族团结，我们绝不容许。
    各地伊斯兰教界人士也一致谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的行为。宁夏回族自治区伊斯兰教协会主任马振东说，印度扩张主义分子歪曲事实，颠倒黑白，公然干涉我国内政，这种行为使我非常愤怒。中国人民一贯热爱和平，坚决执行和平外交政策，从不干涉别国内政，但是也决不容许别人干涉我们的内政。我希望印度扩张主义分子把头脑放冷静一点。成都市伊斯兰教教长、七十七岁的阿訇杨培之说：我主教已有四十多年，受过帝国主义和国民党反动派很多气，他们随便占用教堂，拿走清真寺的东西。解放后，人民政府真正做到了保护宗教信仰自由。印度扩张主义分子和西藏上层反动集团的无耻谰言，只能暴露他们妄想分裂我国统一和永远奴役西藏人民的罪恶目的。重庆市伊斯兰教人士28日举行了座谈会。到会的人一致愤怒谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的行为，并通过了抗议书，强烈抗议孟买警察当局纵容暴徒侮辱我国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席像的挑衅行为。
    许多地方的基督教、天主教和道教界人士也纷纷举行座谈会。中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会和上海市基督教三自爱国运动委员会28日举行了座谈会。到会的人一致指出，在新中国我们享有完全的宗教信仰自由，但是西藏叛乱分子披着宗教外衣干着奸淫掳掠、挖人心、剥人皮等与宗教教义绝对相反的罪行，简直是禽兽。帝国主义、印度扩张主义分子说我国没有宗教信仰自由，完全是造谣诬蔑。上海天主教人士张士琅、汤履道、陆薇读、陈辅民等人并一致反对帝国主义的工具梵蒂冈在西藏叛乱事件发生后，假借宗教名义干涉我国内政的卑鄙手段。广东省基督教三自爱国运动委员会主席熊真沛在座谈会上谴责外国干涉者的罪行，并向印度扩张主义分子提出警告说，中国人民决不允许任何人破坏和平共处的五项原则和中印人民的友谊。中国道教协会理事、兰州金天观监院韩壬泉说：我国伟大领袖决不允许任何人侮辱。印度扩张主义分子侮辱我国领袖，这是与六亿中国人民为敌。（附图片）
