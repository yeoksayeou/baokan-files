    Categories of Doubt
    Zhuang Nong

    I've just talked about the level of seeing things, and I'd also like to talk about the categories of doubt. This is also inspired by "New Events at Mang River."

    The impression the "skeptics" give us is actually another name for the regressionists. They look at all new things with gray, conservative glasses. However, Zhou Beiyu, the furnace chief of the No. 6 furnace, originally held a skeptical attitude towards Guo Fayan's suggestion. But he is still a promoter after all. So I think "doubt" is not all bad. Doubters are not all "skeptics." It depends on what they doubt and why they doubt it. Therefore, doubt and doubters can be divided into several types.

    Like Guo Fayan, he is the initiator of new methods. Doesn't he have "doubts"? Yes, but what he doubts is not the new method, but the original old method. If he didn't doubt the old methods, such as the past ore grade, crushing particle size, etc., he would not be able to doubt the past output. Therefore, he couldn't discover new problems such as "the past ore grade was not high, and the crushing particle size was uneven," he couldn't find weak links, he couldn't propose improvement methods, and he couldn't propose the suggestion of "producing 10,000 catties per day." This is a positive doubt that constantly demands improvement and has a practical basis. It can be called active doubt, and should be strongly advocated. The doubter is an excellent promoter and should be respected.

    Like Zhou Beiyu, he didn't doubt the old things at that time at first, but doubted the new things. His doubt was mainly due to his lack of understanding of the new methods. Therefore, his doubt was without practical basis and cannot be said to be advanced; however, he had the active desire to increase production. The purpose of his visit was to break the doubt and grasp the truth. So he was able to correct his mistakes and obey the truth: once he saw it, he could "turn around and leave, and immediately go back to mobilize the masses to march towards the 10,000-catty output." As a result, he also became the most active supporter and executor of the new method. The motive of this kind of doubt should be said to come from the exploration of truth. This can be said to be the doubt of the backward. Backward is also progress, so the doubter is still a promoter. When people don't understand new things, this kind of doubt is inevitable. With this kind of doubt and the breaking of doubt, they can more firmly grasp the truth and more firmly support new things. I think the significance of typical experiments mainly lies in establishing new role models, dispelling public doubts, and promoting more people to move forward!

    Finally, there is a kind of person, the so-called skeptic, who deeply believes in the old things, even appreciates them, but always speculates and doubts about the new things. What they love is the old rules, and what they fear is the new changes. They are willing to coexist with the old things, but are unwilling to take half a step forward. This kind of doubt does not come from the exploration of truth, but from the preference for the old things and the disgust and fear of the new things. The root cause of this emotion lies in the fact that they are too closely connected with the old things and cannot be separated. This kind of doubt is negative and harmful. The doubter is a thorough regressionist.

    The result of doubt is affirmation or negation. The doubt of the advanced is always based on evidence, so they can make conditional negation or conditional affirmation; this affirmation or negation may be correct. People who cannot doubt are actually blind, and cannot have solid affirmation or solid negation. As for the unconditional doubt of the new and the unconditional affirmation of the old, that is just the skill of the skeptics, which comes from their subjective desire to violate objective development. Their negation and affirmation are both wrong and absurd.

    In short, by distinguishing people's different positions on the old and new things from the different objects of doubt, the different motives held by the doubters, and the different things they affirm or deny, this position is the boundary between the promoters and the regressionists. It also determines whether people do things correctly or wrongly, wisely or absurdly. Therefore, the important thing is not whether to doubt or not, whether to be able to doubt or not, but what to doubt, why to doubt, in a word, whether the doubter's position is correct.

    怀疑的类别
    庄农
    刚刚谈过看事的高低，还想谈谈怀疑的类别。这也是从“漭河新事”中得到的启发。
    “怀疑派”给我们的印象，实际上就是促退派的别名，他们是带着守旧的灰色的眼镜来看待一切新事物的。可是，那个六号炉炉长周备玉，原先也曾对郭法彦的建议，抱着怀疑态度。但他终究还是一个促进派。于是我觉得，“怀疑”并不都是坏的。怀疑者又不都是“怀疑派”。单看他怀疑什么，又为了什么怀疑。因此，怀疑和怀疑者又可以分为几种。
    像郭法彦，他是新办法的倡议者，难道他就没有“怀疑”吗？有的，不过他怀疑的并不是新办法，而是怀疑那原来的旧办法。他要不是对旧办法，比如过去的矿石品位，粉碎粒度等等发生怀疑，也就无法怀疑过去的产量。因此，他便发现不了“过去矿石品位不高，粉碎粒度不均匀”这些新问题，也就找不到薄弱环节，也就提不出改进办法，也就无法提出“日产万斤”的建议。这是不断要求改进而又有实际根据的怀疑。可以叫作积极的怀疑，应该大力提倡。怀疑者是出色的促进派，应该受到推崇。
    像周备玉，他开始并没有怀疑那时的旧事物，而是怀疑了新事物，他的怀疑，主要由于对新的办法不了解。因此，他的怀疑是没有实际根据的，不能说是先进的；但是，他有积极提高产量的愿望，他来参观的目的是为了打破怀疑，掌握真理。所以他能修正错误服从真理：当他一看之后，便能够“扭头就走，回去马上发动群众向万斤产量进军”。结果，他也成了新办法的最积极的支持者和执行者。这种怀疑的动机，应该说还是出自对真理的探讨，这可说是后进者的怀疑，后进也是进，所以怀疑者也还是促进派。当人们对新事物还不理解的时候，这种怀疑是不可免的，有了这种怀疑和怀疑的破除，就能使他们更牢固地掌握住真理，更坚实的支持新事物。我想，典型试验的意义，主要就在树立新的榜样，破除众疑，推动更多的人前进吧！
    最后有一种人，也就是所谓怀疑派，他们对旧的事物是深信不疑，甚而是备加欣赏，对新的事物却总是妄加揣测，怀疑多端。他们爱的是老规矩，怕的是新变动。愿同旧事物共存亡，而不愿舍此前进半步。这种怀疑，并非出自对真理的探讨，而是对旧事物的偏爱和对新事物的厌恶和恐惧。产生这种情绪的根本原因，却又在他们同旧事物粘连过紧，撕掳不开。这种怀疑是消极的，有害的。怀疑者是地地道道的促退派。
    怀疑的结果是肯定或者是否定。先进者的怀疑总是有根据的，因此能够作出有条件的否定或有条件的肯定来；这肯定或否定，都有可能作到正确。不会怀疑的人，实际上是盲目，既不能有坚实的肯定，也不可能有坚实的否定。至于无条件的怀疑新的而又无条件的肯定旧的那只是怀疑派的看家本领，是从他们违反客观发展的主观愿望出发的，他们的否定和肯定都是错误和荒谬的。
    总之，从怀疑对象的不同，怀疑者所持的动机的不同，他们所肯定或否定的东西的不同，区分出人们对新旧事物的不同立场来，这立场就是促进派和促退派的界线，它又决定着人们作事的正确和错误，明智和荒谬。因此，重要的不在于要不要怀疑，能不能怀疑，而在于怀疑的什么，为什么要怀疑，一句话在于怀疑者的立场是否正确。
