    "The Kite" and its French Director
    Zhen Gan
    "The Kite" is a color children's story film co-produced by Chinese and French filmmakers. It is also the first film co-produced by Chinese filmmakers and filmmakers from a capitalist country.
    The French director of "The Kite" is Roger Pigaut. He is a member of the Paris Peace Committee of France, a member of the Anti-Fascist Committee of the French theater community, and a member of the Film Committee of the France-China Friendship Association. He is a talented actor, and "The Kite" is his first directorial work. He had a long-held wish to co-produce a children's film with China. Initially, he only wanted to shoot a lyrical short film depicting the lives of children in China and France on the same day. However, in the process of writing the script, he felt that the original material could be developed into a feature film, so he abandoned his original plan and changed it to a story film using a kite to connect the friendship between Chinese and French children. However, the original kite was just an ordinary butterfly kite. It was not until his friend, the famous documentary director Joris Ivens, brought him a Sun Wukong kite from Beijing that he was inspired and decided to let the "Sun Wukong" that had caused a sensation in Paris also appear in the film. His wish was finally realized with the cooperation of Chinese and French filmmakers.
  The film "The Kite" participated in the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1958 and won the "Honorary Award". Later, it won the "Fraternity Award" awarded by the French literary and art circles and the "Youth Award" specially awarded by the French Youth Film Association, which has 450,000 members.
    "The Kite" was officially released in Paris as early as December 1958 and received favorable reviews. Georges Sadoul, a French progressive film critic and film historian, believes that "'The Kite' is a film full of fantasy and friendship. It not only attracts children, but also captures adults. It allows people to see the poetry of Beijing and Paris through the eyes of children." Another French film critic, Henri Magnan, specifically pointed out that the success of the film lies in "the novel subject matter and the beauty of the pictures." Film critic Armand Monjo is of the opinion that it is "a sweet film, a modern fairy tale." Even French bourgeois newspapers, such as "Le Monde," affirmed that "The Kite" is "a film that should be seen."
    "The Kite" not only demonstrates the friendship between the Chinese and French people, and the solidarity and cooperation between Chinese and French filmmakers, but also enhances the understanding and friendship between the Chinese and French people.

    “风筝”和它的法国编导
    振淦
    “风筝”，是我国和法国电影工作者合作摄制的彩色儿童故事片，也是我国电影工作者和资本主义国家的电影工作者合作的第一部影片。
    “风筝”的法国编导是罗奇·比果。他是法国巴黎和平委员会的委员、法国戏剧界反法西斯委员会的成员之一，还是法中友协电影委员会的委员。他是一位有才能的演员，“风筝”是他导演的第一部作品。他很早就有一个愿望：和中国合拍一部儿童片。最初，他只是想拍一部抒情的短片，表现在同一天内，中、法两国儿童的生活。但在编写剧本的过程中，他感到原题材可以发展成故事片，便放弃了原来的计划，改成用一架风筝联结中、法两国儿童的友谊的故事片。不过，最初的风筝只是一架普通的蝴蝶风筝，直到他的朋友、著名的纪录片导演伊文思由北京给他带去一架孙悟空风筝时，他才获得启发，决定让曾经轰动过巴黎的“孙悟空”也在影片中出现。他的愿望在中、法两国电影工作者的合作下，终于实现了。
  影片“风筝”，曾在1958年参加捷克斯洛伐克的卡罗维·发利电影节，获得了“荣誉奖”。以后，又获得法国文艺界颁发的“博爱奖”和拥有四十五万会员的法国青年电影协会特摄的“青年奖”。
    “风筝”早在1958年12月就在巴黎正式上映，获得了好评。法国进步影评家、电影史学家乔治·萨杜尔认为“‘风筝’是一部富于幻想，充满友情的影片，它不仅能吸引住儿童，也抓住了成人，它通过儿童的眼睛，让人们看到了北京和巴黎的诗意”。另一位法国影评家亨利·马?特别指出影片成功之处正在于“新颖的题材和画面的美”。影评家阿尔曼·蒙郁则认为是“一部甘美的影片，是一首现代童话”。即使是法国资产阶级报纸，例如“世界报”，也肯定“风筝”是“一部应当去看的影片”。
    “风筝”不但表现了中、法人民的友谊，表现了中、法两国电影工作者的团结合作，同时也增进了中、法两国人民的了解和友谊。
