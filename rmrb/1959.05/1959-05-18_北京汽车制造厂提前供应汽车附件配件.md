    The Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which is responsible for supplying automobile accessories and parts to factories such as the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing Plant, and many local automobile repair shops, has essentially delivered all of the automobile accessories and parts that were supposed to be supplied in the second quarter by April. Now, this plant is producing automobile accessories and parts for these automobile manufacturing plants, etc., for the third quarter.
    The Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant is the largest factory in the country manufacturing automobile accessories. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, this plant has begun manufacturing automobiles. In order to meet the needs of manufacturing and repairing automobiles accessories and parts nationwide this year, the factory held a general meeting of all employee representatives in February and passed a resolution to increase the production of automobile accessories and parts. Immediately afterward, the factory took measures such as strengthening the technical force in the automobile accessories and parts workshops, increasing the output of automobile accessories and parts this year by 61% compared to last year.
    In order to ensure product quality, the factory's Party committee mobilized all employees to formulate and improve the quality inspection system, ensuring that unqualified products do not leave the factory. Now, each workshop, section, and group in this factory has a three-level quality inspection system for first piece, intermediate, and finished product inspection. Quality inspectors also regularly patrol and rotate to check product quality. (Zhang Huixian)

    北京汽车制造厂提前供应汽车附件配件
    本报讯　担负着供应长春第一汽车制造厂、洛阳拖拉机制造厂等厂和许多地方修理汽车用的汽车附件和配件任务的北京汽车制造厂，已经把应该在第二季度供应的汽车附件和配件提前在4月份基本交清。现在这个厂正为这些汽车制造厂等生产第三季度的汽车附件和配件。
    北京汽车制造厂是全国最大的制造汽车附件的工厂，去年生产大跃进以来，这个厂开始制造汽车。为了满足今年全国各地制造和修理汽车的附件和配件的需要，工厂在2月间举行了全体职工代表大会，通过了增加汽车附件和配件产量的决议。紧接着工厂采取了加强汽车附件和配件车间的技术力量等措施，使今年的汽车附件和配件的产量比去年增加了61％。
    为了保证产品质量，这个厂的党委发动全体职工制订和健全了质量检查制度，保证不合格的产品不出厂。现在这个厂的各个车间、工段、小组都有首件、中间和成品检查的三级质量检验制度，质量检查员还要经常巡回轮流检查产品质量。　（张慧贤）
