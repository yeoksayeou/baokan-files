Taking Animal Husbandry as the Main Focus, Combining Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and Developing Industry According to Local Conditions
Hainan Tibetans Rapidly Catch Up with Advanced Nationalities

    (Our report) The Dengta People's Commune in Xinghai County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing industry according to local conditions, achieved a great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production last year, greatly changing the face of the grassland.

    The number of various livestock increased from 128,961 in 1957 to 163,854; 4,300 mu of wasteland were reclaimed, breaking the millennium taboo, 19 new irrigation canals were built, and more than 100 springs were dug, yielding a harvest of 510,000 jin of grain; and, for the first time on the grasslands, meat products, dairy products, soap, rayon, lime, bricks and tiles, sausage casings, agricultural and animal husbandry tool repair, bone meal, biological medicine, and more than a dozen other factories were established.

    The Dengta People's Commune has a total of 446 households, most of whom are Tibetan, with a small number of Hui and Han nationalities. The surrounding area has abundant pastures and rich resources, with large areas of arable land, making it possible to develop diversified operations. From ancient times, the herdsmen have lived a nomadic life, moving with the water and grass. In early 1956, two pastoral cooperatives were established here, gradually promoting settlement and breaking the convention of operating only animal husbandry. For a long time, the vast herdsmen were in deep distress under the oppression of reactionary herdowners, headmen, and religion. With the arrival of the high tide of cooperativization in 1957, a small handful of reactionary herdowners and headmen were unwilling to give up feudal exploitation and stubbornly resisted socialist transformation, seriously affecting socialist construction. Therefore, a large-scale anti-feudal struggle swept across the entire grassland. The feudal system and privileges of the herdowners' ownership of the means of production, tribes, religion, and other forms of oppression and exploitation of laboring herdsmen were all destroyed, further liberating the herdsmen politically and ideologically, and unprecedentedly raising their socialist and communist consciousness. Especially after the establishment of the people's commune, the development of diversified operations opened up broad prospects for a great leap forward in production. In the past, the vast herdsmen had to transport every grain of food and every backward iron tool from hundreds of miles away, and slaughter a large number of livestock every year, relying entirely on supplies from other places for all other production and living materials. After engaging in diversified operations of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, this situation was fundamentally changed.

    Reclaiming wasteland for farming and running factories were unfamiliar to the herdsmen. People adhered to the principle of self-reliance and made do with whatever was available. Commune members invested in the commune to solve the difficulties of tools and seeds. Not understanding technology, they learned from Han cadres and workers in the labor process. Now, more than 60 skilled Tibetan people have been trained as the first generation of workers, and some herdsmen have become all-rounders in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry technology.

    After the Dengta People's Commune developed diversified operations, all walks of life promoted each other and developed together. In the past, animal bones were discarded all over the ground, but now they are used by the bone meal factory; animal oil is made into soap, and intestines are made into sausage casings. Conversely, industry has supported agriculture and animal husbandry. The biological medicine factory has produced more than 800 jin of terramycin, and each lamb eats one or two each day, growing four more jin of meat in ten days, playing a certain role in helping livestock overcome the weakness barrier. The large quantities of products supplied by the agricultural and animal husbandry tool repair factory and the fertilizer factory basically meet the needs of agriculture and animal husbandry. Animal husbandry and agriculture also promote each other. In this year's spring plowing, animal husbandry supplied agriculture with 150 million jin of livestock manure fertilizer, and last year agriculture supplied livestock with more than 1 million jin of feed and fodder. Thanks to the guarantee of fertilizer, the plan to harvest 350 jin per mu on the 10,000 mu of newly reclaimed land this year will not only achieve self-sufficiency, but also sell a large amount of surplus grain to the state. It has also created conditions for the plan to increase livestock by more than 35%. And industry will hand over 150,000 yuan in profits to the commune this year.

    The simultaneous development of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry has greatly changed the face of the Heka grassland. The people who once moved with the water and grass, wandering on the grassland year after year, are rapidly catching up with advanced nationalities. At present, in animal husbandry production, they are developing ewe estrus synchronization and striving for two litters a year. This year's planned net increase in livestock, just in sheep alone, will be 15,000 more than in the great leap forward of 1958. Agricultural production is in tense preparation for plowing, busy transporting fertilizer and watering spring water on the newly reclaimed land. Soon, paper mills, power plants, and other factories will also be built on the grassland, and preparations are already being actively made.

    以牧为主农牧结合因地制宜发展工业
    海南藏族快步追赶先进民族
    本报讯　青海省海南藏族自治州兴海县灯塔人民公社，以牧为主、农牧结合、因地制宜地发展工业，去年工农牧业生产取得很大跃进，使草原面貌大为改观。
    各种牲畜由1957年的十二万八千九百六十一头，增加到十六万三千八百五十四头；开荒四千三百亩，打破千年禁忌新修水渠十九条，挖泉一百余个，收获粮食五十一万斤；并且破天荒在草原上办起了肉品、乳品、肥皂、人造棉、石灰、砖瓦、肠衣、农牧工具修配、骨粉、生物药品等十几所工厂。
    灯塔人民公社共四百四十六户，绝大部分是藏族，也有少数回汉民族，周围牧草丰盛、资源富饶，有大面积可垦荒地，开展多种经营大有可为。从久远的年代开始，牧民群众就逐水草而居，过着近似原始的游牧生活。1956年初，在这里建起两个牧业社，才逐步推行定居，打破了单一经营牧业的惯例。长期以来，广大牧民在反动牧主、头人、宗教的压迫下，处在水深火热之中。1957年合作化高潮到来，未经过系统民主改革的牧业区，一小撮反动牧主、头人不甘放弃封建剥削，顽固地抗拒社会主义改造，严重影响社会主义建设。于是，一个大张旗鼓的反封建斗争，席卷整个草原。牧主的生产资料所有制、部落、宗教等压迫剥削劳动牧民的封建制度、特权，全部被摧毁，使牧民在政治上、思想上得到进一步解放，社会主义、共产主义觉悟空前提高。特别是人民公社化以后，展开多种经营、为生产大跃进开辟了广阔的道路。过去，广大牧民吃一粒粮食，用一把落后的铁质工具都要从几百里以外运来，每年宰杀大量牲畜，其他生产、生活资料全部依靠外地供应。而从事工农牧多种经营之后，从根子上改变了这种情况。
    开荒种地、办工厂，对牧民来说是陌生的。人们本着自力更生，因陋就简的原则，社员向社投资，解决了工具和种子的困难。不懂技术，在劳动中向汉族干部和工人学习。现在已经培养出六十多名操作熟练的藏族人民第一代工人，有的牧民成了工农牧业技术上的多面手。
    灯塔人民公社在开展多种经营以后，各行各业互相促进、共同发展。过去抛掷满地的兽骨，现在被骨粉厂利用起来；动物油作成肥皂，肠子制成肠衣。反过来，工业又支援了农牧业，生物药品厂制成八百多斤土霉素，每只羊羔每天吃一两，十天即可多长四斤肉，对牲畜渡过瘦弱关起了一定作用。农牧工具修配厂和化肥厂供给的大批产品，基本上满足了农牧业的需要。畜牧业和农业也是相互促进的，在今年春耕中，牧业上供给农业一亿五千斤畜粪肥料，去年农业供给牲畜饲料、饲草一百多万斤。由于有了肥料的保证，今年一万亩新垦荒地计划亩打三百五十斤，不但可以自给自足，而且将有大批余粮卖给国家。也为牲畜净增35％以上的计划创造了条件。而工业今年将给公社上缴利润十五万元。
    工农牧并举，使河卡草原大大改变了面貌。曾经是逐水草而居，年年月月飘泊在草原上的人们，正快步追赶着先进民族。目前在畜牧业生产上，正展开绵羊催情复配，大搞一年两产。今年计划牲畜净增数，光绵羊一项将比大跃进的1958年多出一万五千只。农业生产，正在紧张备耕，在新垦的土地上忙着运肥、浇春水。草原上，不久还要建起造纸、发电等工厂，现已开始积极备料。
