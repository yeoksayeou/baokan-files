Planting Various Grains, Melons, and Vegetables on Idle Land
Lai'an County in Anhui and Chengguan Commune in Weinan Expand Planting Area, Striving for Greater Harvests

    (By Our Own Correspondent) Anhui Province's Lai'an County, in its spring planting, is not only focusing on high-yield crops and large-scale high-yield and high-production areas, but also increasing the planting area to ensure the realization of a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

    This year, the county's planting area for various spring crops, such as double-cropping early rice, spring corn, spring sweet potatoes, and cotton, has been expanded to varying degrees compared to last year. The planting area for double-cropping early rice has tripled compared to last year, and the original plan was to plant 30,000 mu of spring corn, but now more than 60,000 mu have been planted. After the people's communes conducted surveys and calculations, it was found that the county could utilize a total of 45,000 mu of land saved during water conservancy construction and temporarily unused land; 37,500 mu of embankment ridges and field ridges in ponds, dams, reservoirs, and weirs could be planted with crops; 15,200 mu of vacant land in front of and behind houses could also be utilized; and 12,300 mu of land that had been abandoned after being reclaimed in the past could be planted with a little plowing and tilling. They are utilizing all idle land to plant various grains and melons and vegetables, giving play to the role of auxiliary labor to meet the needs of commune members in regulating their lives.

    (By Our Own Correspondent) Shaanxi Province's Chengguan Commune in Weinan County, while vigorously promoting high-yield fields and carrying out large-scale high-yield movements, is making every effort to expand the planting area of grain crops from all aspects, ensuring that the grain planting area is equal to last year's under the conditions of reduced land area and expanded economic crop area.

    Chengguan Commune has a total of 160,000 mu of cultivated land. Due to the occupation of land by the Longhai Railway double-tracking project, highways, and other basic construction projects, together with the land washed away by the Wei River, there are more than 8,000 mu less. In addition, with the expansion of planting areas for economic crops such as cotton, vegetables, sugar materials, medicinal materials, and fodder (alfalfa) this year, the grain crop area has been reduced by more than 20,000 mu compared to last year. In order to ensure that grain and cotton production still increase despite the reduced cultivated land, the commune is not only vigorously promoting high-yield movements and striving for large-scale high-yield, but also making every effort to expand the planting area.

    Currently, the commune is making efforts from several aspects to expand the spring planting area for grain crops and is preparing to expand the summer planting area for grain crops. Each production team has planted early corn, beans, and other crops on all arable land that can be spring-planted, including river滩地land that was not planted with summer grains last year or is planned for rotation. So far, the entire commune has planted more than 3,000 mu of early corn. Each production team has also made full use of all small plots of vacant land in front of houses and courtyards to plant early corn, beans, and melons and vegetables. The entire commune has also tentatively planned to increase the replanting area of autumn fields after the summer harvest from 66% last year to more than 70% this year, striving to plant another crop after the wheat harvest. Each production team, based on local conditions, has made full use of vacant land such as in front of houses and courtyards and河滩to plant grain and other crops. Together with the expanded replanting area, the preliminary estimate is that the total area will be more than 20,000 mu, and the increased planting area can exceed twice the more than 8,000 mu of land reduced this year.

    利用空闲土地多种杂粮瓜菜
    安徽来安县和渭南城关公社扩大种植面积力争多收
    本报讯　安徽省来安县在春播中一面大抓高产作物、抓大面积高额丰产，同时增加播种面积，以保证实现今年农业大丰收。
    今年全县双季早稻、春玉米、春甘薯、棉花等各种春播作物的面积都比去年有不同程度的扩大，双季早稻种植面积比去年扩大了三倍，原来计划种春玉米三万亩，现在种了六万多亩。经各人民公社排队、算账后，发现全县可利用兴修水利时节约的用地和暂时未动工的土地共有四万五千亩；三万七千五百亩塘坝库圩的埂和田埂都可种庄稼；一万五千二百亩家前屋后的空隙地也可以利用起来，还有一万二千三百亩过去开荒后又丢弃的土地，稍加犁整就可播种。他们利用一切空闲地种植各种杂粮和瓜菜，发挥辅助劳动力的作用，满足社员调剂生活的需要。
    本报讯　陕西渭南县城关公社在大搞丰产方、开展大面积丰产运动的同时，千方百计从各方面扩大粮食作物的播种面积，在土地面积减少和经济作物面积扩大的条件下，作到粮食播种面积和去年相等。
    城关公社共有十六万亩耕地，因为陇海铁路复线及公路、其他基本建设占地，连同渭河冲塌的地共八千多亩，加上今年棉田、蔬菜、糖料、药材等经济作物和饲草（苜蓿）种植面积的扩大，粮食作物面积比去年减少了二万多亩。为了保证在耕地减少的情况下粮食棉花仍要增产。这个公社一方面大搞丰产运动，力争大面积丰产，同时千方百计扩大播种面积。
    目前，这个公社正从几个方面努力扩大春播粮食作物面积，并为扩大夏种粮食作物面积进行准备。各个生产队把凡是可以春播的耕地，包括去年没有种上夏粮或者准备轮作的河滩地等，都播上早玉米、豆类等作物。到现在全公社已播种的早玉米就有三千多亩。各个生产队还充分利用了庄前院后的所有小块空闲土地，播种了早玉米、豆类和瓜菜。全公社还初步计划把夏收后的秋田复种面积，由去年的66％提高到今年的70％以上，力争麦收后再种一季庄稼。各个生产队还根据当地情况，充分利用宅前院后和河滩等空闲土地播种粮食等作物，连同扩大的复种面积，初步估计总面积将有二万多亩，增加的播种面积可以超过今年减少的八千多亩土地的一倍。　（吴　钢）（附图片）
