    Jinan, This Newspaper, 20th Dispatch: After completing the sowing of 11 million mu of cotton, Shandong cotton-producing areas have immediately shifted to seedling management. In recent days, professional teams organized by nearly one million skilled cotton growers throughout the province have been in the cotton fields all day long, checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, thinning seedlings, cultivating and loosening the soil, weeding, eliminating insects, and applying fertilizer.
    In the past, cotton production in Shandong Province was greatly affected by early frost and the lack of early seedling management, resulting in few pre-summer bolls, late autumn bolls, and more post-frost flowers, which greatly affected the yield and quality of cotton. In organizing this year's cotton production, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry conducted several discussions and studies with cotton farmers on how to promote early and abundant boll formation. Based on the experience of large-scale high-yield cotton production in Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Linqing, Gaotang, and other counties last year, it formulated seedling management measures to promote the formation of more pre-summer bolls and mobilized cotton farmers in various places to start early, striving to present a scene of cotton harvest before the summer. The main measures to strengthen seedling management are: (1) Check and replant seedlings early to ensure full stands. After the cotton sowing is completed, immediately organize a specialized force combining cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to check and replant seedlings, ensuring that every plot is checked, every row is seen, broken rows are filled, and missing seedlings are moved to achieve full utilization of every inch of land and striving for every seedling. (2) Early, frequent, and deep hoeing to promote early emergence and robust growth of cotton seedlings. It is required to hoe the cotton fields once or twice before the cotton seeds germinate to shorten the cotton seedling emergence period; after emergence, hoe early, frequently, and deeply to ensure that the soil is always loose and free of weeds. (3) Thin seedlings early and set seedlings early to avoid seedling crowding and control internode development. Start thinning seedlings when 60% of the cotton seedlings have emerged, and complete the thinning after all seedlings have emerged, setting the seedlings after the cotton has grown two to three true leaves. To ensure full and strong seedlings, adopt equidistant selection of strong seedlings for setting, ensuring that the planting density meets the requirements. (4) Thoroughly control diseases and insect pests. First of all, do a good job of disease and insect pest detection, prepare various medicines and machinery, vigorously carry out weeding and insect elimination, and eliminate diseases and insect pests on hosts as early as possible, eliminating all diseases and insect pests outside the cotton fields. (5) Apply fertilizer skillfully and water late to prevent waterlogging. For cotton fields with insufficient base fertilizer, adopt the method of ditching and topdressing during the seedling stage to supplement the base fertilizer; apply more phosphate and potash fertilizer and less nitrogen fertilizer during the seedling stage to ensure that the cotton plants are squat and strong. On the premise of good moisture retention, postpone the first watering of cotton fields to the budding stage to avoid premature watering causing excessive seedling growth and affecting root development, and do a good job of flood prevention facilities to achieve dry land after rain and no standing water in the fields.
    This year, most cotton fields in the province have achieved one-time sowing with full and vigorous seedlings. In the cotton fields in Liaocheng and Zibo prefectures, which were sown early and strengthened management in advance, one or two true leaves have already grown, and cotton farmers are stepping up thinning and setting seedlings. More than 500,000 mu of cotton that has been transplanted early by using greenhouses, heated brick beds, and other methods have begun to bud, and it is estimated that each plant can set four to five old bolls before summer.

    According to Shanxi Daily, Xiliang Management Area of Xianfeng Commune, led by national cotton planting model Wu Chun'an, fully listens to the opinions of various people on cotton planting technology and formulates cotton planting technology programs in accordance with local conditions.
    This year, Xiliang Management Area's 1,260 mu of cotton, due to fine land preparation, sufficient fertilizer, and good seeds, coupled with a thorough rain, now has full stands of seedlings on every mu, and one to two true leaves have grown. Production teams have begun thinning and setting seedlings. In order to achieve rational seedling retention, the management area recently organized commune members to conduct a special debate on the issue of rational close planting of cotton. The answer everyone found from the facts of the past few years is: close planting can increase production, but it should not be too dense. After the cotton seedlings emerged, Comrade Wu Chun'an organized more than 250 experienced farmers, both male and female youths, to conduct field visits, from which everyone realized that over-density and over-sparseness were both unreasonable. In cultivating cotton, this management area has experimented with various dense plantings in recent years, such as retaining 10,000, 8,000, and 6,000 seedlings per mu. Facts have proved that 10,000 is too dense. Because it is not ventilated and lighted, there are very few fruit branches, and flowering is also late, and 40% are empty plants. Is sparseness okay? Everyone also found the answer from the debate: no. Commune member Yao Kejun said: In 1954, the 260 mu of cotton at the bottom of the river only produced more than 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which was 14 jin less than in 1953. The main reason was that there were only 1,800 to 2,500 cotton seedlings per mu. Since that year, we have accepted this lesson, and the number of cotton plants has been appropriately increased year after year, and the cotton yield has also increased year after year. Commune member Wang Dekui said: Don't say that sparseness is not okay, even being slightly sparse is not okay. In 1957, my team had an 11-mu cotton field, with the same land, the same cultivation, and the same management. Six and a half mu retained 5,500 seedlings per mu, producing 1,088 jin of seed cotton per mu; the remaining four and a half mu retained 4,800 seedlings per mu, a difference of 700 plants, resulting in 188 jin less seed cotton. How is rational close planting defined? After research, everyone unanimously agreed that how many seedlings should be retained per mu of cotton should be based on the different characteristics of climate, soil, variety, and management, and water land, dry land, slope land, ditch land, clay, sandy soil, and loamy soil should be differentiated, as well as the different characteristics of cotton seeds such as "517," Dai Zi cotton, "108 husband," and Si Zi cotton, and determined plot by plot. According to the local situation, everyone formulated a preliminary plan for rational close planting of cotton: the number of seedlings retained in dry land should be greater than that in water land, the number of seedlings retained for "517" varieties should be greater than that for Dai Zi cotton, and the number of seedlings retained in loamy soil should be greater than that in sandy soil. Waterlogged land should retain 5,500 to 6,500 seedlings per mu, with row spacing of 1.8 to 2.2 feet; dry land should retain 6,500 to 8,000 seedlings per mu, with row spacing of 1.3 to 1.5 feet. At the same time, seedlings should be thinned early and set early, thinned after the seedlings have fully emerged, and set when one to two true leaves appear. Seedling setting should be done with three things (ruler, basket, and medicine), equidistant and uniform, removing the weak and retaining the strong, ensuring standardization. Shallow cultivation and widespread pest control should be started after the seedlings have fully emerged. Water should be irrigated in small and appropriate amounts during the Xiaoshu, Liqiu, and Bailu periods; fertilizer should be topdressed at the seedling setting, budding, flowering, boll formation, and boll setting stages, using 350 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu.
    At present, the nine production teams of this management area have organized a professional cotton field management team of 460 people and投入了into the battle of thinning, setting, cultivating, and eliminating insects.
    The Yicheng County Party Committee believes that the experience of the Xiliang Management Area is very good and is organizing cadres and cotton farmers from eight cotton-producing communes in the county to conduct on-site visits and study.

    山东吸取去年丰产经验加强棉花幼苗管理
    力争棉花结桃又早又多又大
    山西翼城西梁管理区干部群众在棉花定苗前共商密植大计
    本报济南20日电　山东各产棉地区完成一千一百万亩棉花播种任务后，立即转向幼苗管理。近几天来，全省由近百万植棉能手组织的专业军，终日在棉田里查苗、补苗、疏苗、中耕松土、除草、灭虫和追肥。
    往年，山东省的棉花由于早霜侵袭和没有及早加强幼苗管理，伏前结桃少，秋桃晚，霜后花较多，大大影响了棉花的产量和质量。在组织今年的棉花生产中，山东省农林厅就如何促使棉花早结桃、多结桃，同棉农们进行了多次讨论研究，并根据山东省农业科学院和临清、高唐等县去年棉花大面积高额丰产的经验，制定了促使棉花多结伏前桃的幼苗管理措施，动员各地棉农及早动手，力争棉花丰收局面呈现在入伏以前。加强幼苗管理的主要措施是：（1）及早查苗补苗，确保全苗。在棉花播种结束后，立即组织干部、技术员和老农三结合的专门力量查苗补苗，作到块块查，垅垅看、断垅补足、缺苗移全，达到寸土不闲，棵苗必争。（2）早锄、勤锄、深锄，促使棉花早出苗和健壮生长。要求在棉种破土抽芽前普遍锄梦花一至两遍，缩短棉花出苗期；出苗后早锄、勤锄、深锄，作到土壤经常疏松，地无杂草。（3）早间苗，早定苗，避免幼苗拥挤，控制节间发长。在棉花出苗60％时即开始间苗，出齐间完，棉花长出二至三个真叶定完苗。为使苗全苗壮，采取等距选壮定苗，确保种植密度达到规格要求。（4）彻底除治病虫害。首先要作好病虫害侦查工作，准备好各种药械，大力进行除草灭虫，及早除治寄主上的病虫害，把所有病虫害消灭在棉田以外。（5）巧施肥，晚浇水，预防涝害。底肥不足的棉田，在幼苗期采取开沟追肥的办法，补足底肥；苗期多施磷钾肥，少施氮肥，保证棉株蹲实健壮。在保墒良好的前提下，棉田第一次浇水推迟到现蕾期进行，避免早水引起幼苗徒长，影响根部发育，并作好防涝设施，达到雨过地干，田无积水。
    今年全省大部分棉田都达到一次播种，苗全苗旺。聊城、淄博两个专区播种早又提前加强管理的棉田，已长出一两个真叶，棉农们正加紧间苗和定苗。各地利用温室、火炕等办法，提前育苗移栽的五十多万亩棉花，有的已开始现蕾，估计在入伏前每株可座四至五个老桃。
    据山西日报报道　全国植棉模范吴春安领导的先锋公社西梁管理区，在植棉技术上充分听取各种人的意见，因地制宜地制订出植棉技术方案。
    西梁管理区今年播种的一千二百六十亩棉花，由于整地细、粪饱、种好，加上一场透雨，现在亩亩出苗齐全，已长出一至两个真叶，各生产队已开始间苗、定苗。为了做到合理留苗，最近，管理区组织社员就棉花合理密植问题，开展了一次专题辩论。大家从几年来的事实中找到的答案是：密植能增产，但不可太密。棉苗出土后，吴春安同志组织了老农和男女青年二百五十多名，先后进行了田间参观，从活生生的事实中，大家认识了过密过稀都不合理。这个管理区在培植棉花中，近几年曾试验过每亩留苗万株、八千株、六千株等多种密植。事实证明，万株太密了。因为不通风透光，果枝极少，开花也迟，40％是空株。稀了行不行呢？大家从辩论中也找到了答案：不行。社员姚克俊说：1954年河底的二百六十亩棉花，每亩只产六十多斤皮棉，比1953年每亩少产十四斤，主要原因是每亩只有棉苗一千八百株至两千五百株。从那年以后，我们接受了这个教训，棉株连年适当增加，棉花产量也就连年上升。社员王德奎说：不要说过稀不行，就是稍微稀一点也不行。1957年我队有一块十一亩的棉花地，同样土地、同样耕作、同样管理，有六亩五分每亩留苗五千五百株，亩产一千零八十八斤籽棉；下余四亩五分每亩留苗四千八百株，相差七百株，就少产一百八十八斤籽棉。怎样才算合理密植呢？大家经过研究，一致认为，每亩棉花该留多少苗，这要根据气候、土壤、品种、管理的不同特点，分别水地、旱地、坡地、沟地、粘土、沙土、绵土等不同土质，分别“五一七”，岱字棉，“一○八夫”，斯字棉等棉籽的不同特性，分片逐块地来决定。根据当地的情况，大家制定了棉花合理密植的初步方案是：旱地留苗应多于水地，“五一七”品种留苗应多于岱字棉，绵土地留苗应多于沙土地。水坑地每亩应留苗五千五百株至六千五百株，行距一尺八至二尺二寸；旱地每亩六千五百至八千株，行距一尺三至一尺五寸。同时要早间苗，早定苗，苗出齐后间苗，一至二个真叶时定苗，定苗时要作到三带（带尺、带筐、带药剂），等距均匀，去弱留强，保证规格化。苗出齐后开始浅中耕和普遍治虫。要适时适量地在小暑、立秋、白露各浇一次水；在定苗、现蕾、开花、成铃、结桃时期各追肥一次，每亩要追化肥三百五十斤。
    目前，这个管理区的九个生产队已组织起棉田管理专业队伍四百六十人，投入了间苗、定苗、中耕、灭虫战斗。
    中共翼城县委认为西梁管理区的经验很好，正组织全县八个产棉公社的干部和棉农进行现场参观和学习。
