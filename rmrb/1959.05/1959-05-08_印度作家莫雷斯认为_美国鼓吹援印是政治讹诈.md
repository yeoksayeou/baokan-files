    Indian Writer Moraes Believes
    US Advocacy of Aid to India is Political Blackmail
    (Dispatch from Washington) Indian writer Frank Moraes believes that some American financial tycoons and politicians are using the Tibetan incident to advocate for the United States to greatly "aid" India, which is an act of political blackmail. Moraes made these remarks at a meeting held on the 4th by the "International Economic Development Committee," an organization of major American entrepreneurs. Before his speech, US Vice President Nixon advocated at the meeting that the United States should step up "aid" to India in order to carry out the so-called competition between India and China in economic development. The news said that Moraes pointed out in his speech: "Using China to oppose India is political blackmail. I don't see it that way, and I don't want to be helped based on these claims."

    印度作家莫雷斯认为
    美国鼓吹援印是政治讹诈
    本报讯　华盛顿消息：印度作家弗兰克·莫雷斯认为，美国一些财阀和政客利用西藏事件鼓吹美国应大力“援助”印度是政治讹诈行为。莫雷斯是在由美国大企业家组织的“国际经济发展委员会”4日举行的会议上说这番话的。在他发言之前，美国副总统尼克松在会议上鼓吹美国加紧“援助”印度，以进行所谓印度和中国在经济发展方面的竞争。消息说，莫雷斯在发言中指出：“拿中国来同印度对立是政治讹诈。我并不是这样看的，我不想根据这些说法得到帮助。”
