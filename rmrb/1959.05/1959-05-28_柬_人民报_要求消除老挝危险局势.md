Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 26th: Today's "People's News" said that the signatories of the Geneva Agreements and the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference should take urgent and effective measures to eliminate the dangerous situation in Laos and immediately restore the activities of the International Commission for Laos.

The newspaper pointed out that the tense situation in Laos was caused by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The blood-stained hands of this imperialist military bloc have reached into Laos, using its puppets in Laos in an attempt to launch a civil war in Laos and persecute Lao patriots. It pointed out that this is part of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's war plan.

The newspaper said that Cambodia is very disturbed by the tense situation in Laos and believes that this situation threatens Cambodia. The conspiracies carried out by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are aimed at encircling Cambodia and dragging it into this military bloc.

Today, "Homeland News" commented on the situation in Laos, saying that the core of the problem is whether the Geneva Agreements and the agreement between the Lao Fighting Forces and the Royal Lao Government are being observed. The newspaper expressed the hope that the tense situation in Laos can be resolved quickly.

    报纸指出，老挝的紧张局势是东南亚条约组织所造成的，这个帝国主义军事集团沾满鲜血的双手已经伸入老挝，利用它在老挝的傀儡，企图发动老挝的内战和迫害老挝的爱国者。它指出，这是东南亚条约组织战争计划的一部分。
    这家报纸说，柬埔寨对于老挝的紧张局势感到非常不安，并且认为，这种局势威胁到柬埔寨。东南亚条约组织所进行的阴谋活动是要包围柬埔寨并且把它拉入这个军事集团。
