Fellow Committee Members:

I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

In 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the people of our country achieved a great leap forward, with steel, coal, grain, and cotton production all doubling, and culture and art developing unprecedentedly. People's spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes as a result.

I am an actor who has performed Yue Opera for more than 40 years. I have performed abroad quite a bit. Although I have a little artistic reputation and live a decent life, I am often indignant to see my compatriots being insulted and discriminated against. Thinking about it carefully, it is inevitable that a country without morality is weak and incompetent, and people insult others and are insulted. And an artist, even if he has a grand aspiration to love the country and is unwilling to be a citizen of a weak country, how can he do anything? Over time, I developed a thought that I would never see the day when the country would become strong in my lifetime.

Fortunately, the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country to achieve liberation, and after liberation, they led us to realize various reforms and constructions. In just ten years, the motherland has reached such a prosperous and strong stage, and its international status has been raised unprecedentedly. Not only has the suffering of the people of a weak country gone forever, but I also deeply feel that just being a citizen of the great New China is infinitely excited and proud.

Along with the rapid development of the socialist national economy, the cultural and artistic undertakings of our country have also achieved amazing development. Where does such development come from? From the perspective of an actor like me, I deeply realize that the leadership of the Party is the most important key. The Party's care and guidance for our drama circles is truly meticulous. After liberation, the Party and the people gave us the glorious title of artistic workers, entrusted us with the important responsibility of educating the people, and also gave us a higher arrangement politically. I myself was appointed as the director of the Guangdong Yue Opera Academy due to the Party's cultivation and trust, and was also arranged as a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC. The Party also gave us great care and consideration in our lives, building dormitories, dining halls, and clubs for us, so that the old can live in peace, the young can be cared for, and also very concerned about our health, helping us to adjust the time of work and rest, so that I can live comfortably and happily, full of energy, and engage in artistic research and creation.

The Party is even more concerned about our artistic progress. For example, it helped us establish the Yue Opera Academy, theaters, and rehearsal halls, and helped us establish a rehearsal system and establish Red and Expert schools. It also invited several Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera teachers to teach us the basic knowledge of opera. The Central Ministry of Culture has held actor training courses for us. In addition, it also regularly organizes observation performances. All of this not only cultivates a large number of new forces quickly, but also greatly improves the acting skills of veteran Yue Opera artists. The achievements made by Yue Opera since liberation are entirely due to the Party's love and care. Therefore, every time I think of the contrast between the old and new societies, I sincerely feel the greatness of the Party and our infinitely bright future.

Last year, after the anti-Rightist struggle, in order to enable the Yue Opera circle to carry out self-education and self-transformation well, the Party adopted the method of going out to rectify the style of work. More than 30 major actors, playwrights, musicians, and stage designers from the Yue Opera circle were organized to visit and study in Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenyang, Anshan, Lushun, Dalian, Jinan, Hangzhou and other places, to promote us to go to the great socialist construction life practice, to further understand the soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the national workers, peasants, soldiers and working people, thus touched and encouraged us, prompting all comrades to eagerly and automatically propose to examine their own ideology and style of work during the journey, and urgently request self-transformation. Under the leadership of the Party, we conducted frank criticism and self-criticism on the way back. Through the education of the rectification movement, our political thoughts have greatly improved. I deeply realized that the Party's education for us is like a serious and kind father, earnestly teaching and never tired of teaching. Therefore, not only did I see my own path clearly, which is to follow the Party, but also strengthened my confidence in actively striving to be a working-class intellectual who is both red and expert.

After the rectification, the Yue Opera circle responded to the Party's call and resolutely implemented the policy of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers with art. Yue Opera adopted the method of "delivering opera to the door," going up the mountains, down to the countryside, to factories, construction sites, mines, and to the front line of Fujian to perform for the workers, peasants and soldiers. Wherever we went, the great masses' desire for art and their warm welcome to us deeply moved the actors' feelings. On the one hand, we felt that our emptiness failed to meet the needs of the masses; on the other hand, it gave us infinite encouragement and urging. Through such performance activities, we have been greatly educated and improved politically and artistically. Therefore, we further realized that only by resolutely implementing the Party's correct policy of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers with art, can the vitality of art be endless. This is a great gain of the rectification in the Yue Opera circle. Although I am relatively old, my heart is younger than before.

Because we have received the Party's cultivation and care, Yue Opera work has achieved great results in the past year. Please allow me to briefly talk about one or two here. First of all, Yue Opera relied on the Party's leadership, put politics in command, implemented the policy of walking on two legs, and in the situation of the Great Leap Forward, sorted out a batch of historical dramas, and at the same time, created and adapted a batch of modern dramas. This batch of historical dramas and modern dramas all have certain artistic quality, so they are welcomed by the broad masses. More outstanding historical dramas include: Guan Hanqing, Burning Incense Record, San Niang Teaches Her Son, Zhao Yun Urges His Return, Qu Yuan, Liang Tianlai, Five Marquis Banquet, Li Wenmao, Three Marshals Trapped in Yaoshan, A Flower, Smartly Seizing Jieyang City, etc. More excellent modern dramas include: Xiang Xiuli, Hongxia, Liu Hulan, Noble Occupation, Red Flag All Over Guangzhou, Three Liwan, Smartly Seizing Tiger Mountain, Honghuagang, Lost Address, Red Breeder and so on. The above-mentioned repertoire has a variety of themes and different styles, and implements the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom. Secondly, the Yue Opera School was established last year, which is the place to cultivate Yue Opera successors. The Yue Opera School currently has nearly 100 students (including music students). Many veteran Yue Opera seniors participated in the teaching of the school, such as Bai Jurong, Liang Shaomo, Zeng Sanduo, Liang Shaojia, Li Cuifang, Luo Jiashu and other comrades, and I myself also participated in contributing a share of my strength. In addition, Yue Opera can actively participate in every political movement and quickly and actively cooperate with the Party's propaganda work. What I said above are our bits and pieces of achievements and contributions, but the acquisition of these achievements is inseparable from the Party's care and leadership. Of course, for the needs of the broad masses of people, our work is still far from enough, and we still need to make greater efforts under the leadership of the Party in the future. I hope that the cultural and artistic workers and all members present here will give more advice.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Tibet issue. I express my infinite indignation at the shameful rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique against the motherland and undermining unity, and I fully support the measures taken by the Central People's Government to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. Quelling the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. However, Indian expansionists want to inherit the mantle of British imperialism's aggression against our Tibet. I want to solemnly warn Indian expansionists, you must clearly realize that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the 600 million people of China have united as strong as steel and are sacred and inviolable. The era when the Chinese people were bullied and slaughtered by others will never return. If anyone dares to deny this fact and attempts to interfere in our internal affairs, whether now or in the future, they are destined to fail.

### 粤剧进一步同工农结合  马师曾委员的发言

　　粤剧进一步同工农结合
    马师曾委员的发言各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理，彭真副委员长，李维汉副主席的报告。
    一九五八年我国人民在党的领导下，取得了大跃进的伟大胜利，钢、煤、粮、棉生产都成倍地增长，文化艺术空前蓬勃的发展，人们的精神面貌因而起了深刻的变化。
    我是一个演了四十多年粤剧的演员，在海外演戏较多，虽薄有艺名，生活也过得去，但看到自己同胞常被侮辱、歧视，未尝不愤慨于心。细想起来，邦无道，积弱无能，自侮人侮，原是必然，而一个艺人，爱国虽有宏愿，不甘于作一个弱国之民，岂能为力？久之，产生一种思想，以为我这一辈子休想看到国家强盛的一天了。
    天幸中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民取得了解放，而解放后，又领导我们实现各项改革和建设，仅仅十个年头，祖国就已达到这样繁荣昌盛的地步，国际地位空前提高，不仅弱国之民的苦痛一去不复返，而且我还深深感到仅仅是作为一个伟大的新中国的公民也已感到无限的兴奋和自豪。
    与社会主义国民经济飞速发展的同时，我国的文化艺术事业也得到惊人的发展。这样发展从何得来？从我这样一个演员的角度，深深体会到党的领导作用是最主要的关键。党对我们戏剧界的关怀和教导真是无微不至。解放后，党和人民给了我们光荣的艺术工作者的称号，付给我们教育人民的重大责任，在政治上还给我们以较高的安排，我本人就是由于党的培养和信任，担任了广东粤剧院院长，又安排为全国政协委员。在生活上党也给予极大的关怀和照顾，为我们修了宿舍、饭厅、俱乐部，做到老者安之，少者怀之，还非常关心我们的健康，帮助我们调节好工作和休息的时间，使我过得舒畅愉快，精神饱满，干劲十足地从事艺术上的钻研和创造。
    党对我们艺术上的进步更是关怀备至，如帮助我们建立了粤剧院、剧场、排练场，并帮助我们建立排演制度，成立红专学校，还为我们请来了几位昆剧和京剧老师傅教授戏曲的基本知识，中央文化部曾为我们举办了演员讲习会，此外，还经常组织观摩演出，凡此种种，不但大量迅速的培养新生力量，而且对粤剧老艺人的演技有了很大的提高。解放以来粤剧所取得的成绩完全是党的爱护和关怀。因此，每想到新旧社会的对比时，我就衷心地感到党的伟大和我们无限光明的前途。
    去年，在反右派斗争后，党为了使粤剧界能够很好地进行自我教育、自我改造，采取出门整风的办法。组织了粤剧界的主要演员、编剧家、音乐家和舞台装置工作者三十余人到北京、武汉、上海、沈阳、鞍山、旅顺、大连、济南、杭州等地参观学习，推动我们到伟大的社会主义建设生活实际中去，更深一步了解全国工农兵和劳动人民的冲天干劲与革命精神，因而感动了与鼓舞了我们，促使全体同志们在旅途中都迫不及待地自动提出检查自己的思想作风，迫切要求自我改造。在党的领导下，我们在归途中即进行了坦率的批评和自我批评。经过整风运动的教育，我们的政治思想都大大地提高了一步。我深深的体会到，党对我们的教育像个严肃又仁慈的父亲，谆谆善诱，诲人不倦。因此，不但看清了自己的道路，就是跟党走，而且加强了积极争取做个又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的信心。
    整风后，粤剧界响应了党的号召，坚决贯彻了艺术为工农兵服务的方针，粤剧即采取“送戏上门”的办法，上山、下乡，到工厂、工地、矿山，到福建前线为工农兵演出。我们所到的地方，广大群众对艺术的渴望爱好和对我们热烈的欢迎，无不深深地激动了演员的感情。一方面觉得我们空虚未能满足群众的要求；另外也给了我们无限的鼓舞和督促。通过这样的演出活动，在政治思想和艺术上都给了我们很大的教育提高。因此，我们进一步认识了，只有坚决的贯彻了艺术为工农兵服务的党的正确方针，艺术的生命力才是无穷无尽的，这是整风在粤剧界的一次伟大收获。我年纪虽然比较老了，但我的心比前更为年青了。
    由于我们得到了党的培养和关怀，粤剧工作在近一年来，获得了很大的成绩，请让我在这里略谈一二。首先，粤剧依靠了党的领导，政治挂了帅，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，在大跃进的形势中，整理出一批历史剧，同时，也创作和改编了一批现代剧。这一批历史剧和现代剧，都有一定的艺术质量，因此，受到了广大群众的欢迎。比较优秀的历史剧有：关汉卿、焚香记、三娘教子、赵云催归、屈原、梁天来、五侯宴、李文茂、三帅困肴山、一枝花、智取揭阳城等等。比较优秀的现代剧有：向秀丽、红霞、刘胡兰、崇高的职业、红旗插遍广州、三里湾、智取威虎山、红花岗、遗失了地址、红色饲养员等等。以上的剧目题材多种多样，风格各有不同，贯彻了党的百花齐放的方针。其次粤剧学校已于去年成立了，这是培养粤剧接班人的所在地。粤剧学校现有学员（包括音乐学员在内）将近一百人，参加该学校教学的有粤剧界许多老前辈，如白驹荣、靓少莫、曾三多、靓少佳、李翠芳、罗家树等同志，我本人也参加尽一分力量。还有粤剧在每次政治运动都能积极参加，迅速主动配合党的宣传工作。上面所说的，是我们的点点滴滴的成就和贡献，但这些成绩的获得都是与党的关怀和领导是分不开的。自然，对于广大人民的需求来说，我们的工作还是做得很不够，还有待于今后在党的领导下，作更大的努力。希望在座的文化艺术工作者和各位委员多多指教。
    最后，我想就西藏问题讲几句话。最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国，破坏统一的可耻叛乱行为，我表示无限的愤慨，并完全拥护中央人民政府对彻底平定西藏叛乱的措施。平定西藏叛乱是中国的内政，绝不能容许别人干涉。但印度扩张主义分子竟想继承英帝国主义侵略我们西藏的衣钵。要严正的警告印度扩张主义分子，你们要清醒的认识到，中国在共产党的正确领导下，六亿人民已经团结得像钢一样的坚强和神圣不可侵犯，中国人民任人欺侮、宰割的时代永远不复返了。如果谁敢否认这个事实，企图干涉我国内政，不管是现在或将来，都是注定要失败的。
