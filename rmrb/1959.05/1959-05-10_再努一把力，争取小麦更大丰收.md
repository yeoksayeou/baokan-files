　　Make Another Effort and Strive for an Even Greater Wheat Harvest

　　After a hard battle last winter and this spring, the nation's more than 330 million mu of wheat has victoriously passed the greening and jointing stages and is now heading and filling. From south to north, the wheat is growing well. The hard work of the vast number of farmers over the past six months has blossomed into brilliant flowers.

　　Judging from the current wheat growth, the conditions for a bumper harvest are in place. "Wheat harvest has three treasures: many heads, big ears, and full grains." This year's heads are more numerous than last year's, and the ears are also bigger than last year's. According to statistics from Shaanxi Province, first-class wheat accounts for more than 12 million mu, accounting for 52.2% of the total wheat fields, with 400,000 ears per mu. Second-class wheat accounts for 8 million mu, accounting for 34.8% of the total wheat fields, with about 300,000 ears per mu. Third-class wheat accounts for 3 million mu, accounting for 13% of the total wheat fields, with 200,000 ears per mu; while last year's general wheat fields had only about 200,000 ears per mu. This year's wheat is not only long and numerous in ears, but also has strong stalks, black leaves, and vigorous growth. From these circumstances, as long as there are no serious natural disasters in the next few dozen days, a bumper harvest is very promising.

　　However, the growth of wheat has not stopped, and the bumper harvest of wheat has not been finalized. Currently, wheat in the Yangtze River basin is filling, and wheat in the northern region is heading, which is a critical period for wheat growth and maturity. From heading, flowering, pollination to seed setting, the final harvest cannot be completely determined. Because the grains are full and thin, large and small, full grains weigh 13,000 to 14,000 grains per catty, while thin grains require 20,000 grains per catty, the difference is very significant. To ensure that every grain is full, sufficient nutrients and water must be provided during this critical period. Therefore, at this time, another effort should be made to strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields, striving for every ear to have many and full grains, so that the country can increase production by several billion catties or even hundreds of billions of catties of wheat. The idea that the wheat harvest has been finalized and that late-stage management can be relaxed is obviously passive and unacceptable.

　　From the perspective of this year's wheat growth, it is particularly necessary to strengthen late-stage management. This is because: First, all localities have engaged in large-area high-yield wheat fields this year, which is a new thing this year. We have no experience in how to manage large-area high-yield fields well. Therefore, how can we relax wheat field management in the later stages of wheat growth? Second, dense planting has been universally implemented this year. The density of wheat is high, which requires more water and more fertilizer. According to agricultural scientific experiments, from heading to maturity, although the time is short, the amount of water required is particularly large, accounting for about 40% of the total water requirement. This is because after wheat enters the filling period, the growth of all organs has ended, and the nutrients produced by photosynthesis in the stems and leaves are constantly transported to the grains, and the transportation must be carried out by water. Insufficient water will hinder transportation, so it is necessary to quickly strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields.

　　Some people also have such concerns: applying more fertilizer and irrigating may cause the wheat to grow too luxuriantly. This is an unnecessary worry. Wheat is different from rice. Rice that grows too luxuriantly will reduce production, while wheat that grows too luxuriantly does not affect yield. There is a Chinese proverb: "Rice turns green (i.e., grows too luxuriantly) and you won't see it, wheat turns green and you get a bag of flour." The fact is also the same. Last year, Ganggou Commune, Licheng County, Shandong Province, applied one more fertilizer and watered one more time at the end of April, and each mu produced more than 30 catties of wheat.

　　To strive for a greater wheat harvest, it is also necessary to be prepared to fight against natural disasters at all times. It often happens that the wheat is growing very well, but the attack of a disaster not only fails to increase production, but also reduces production. In 1956, wheat in the northern Anhui area was growing very well, and a bumper harvest was in sight, but it suffered from continuous rain, hot wind, and stem rust during the filling period, which reduced production by 30%-50%. Not long ago, Hua Yi Production Team of "July 1st" Commune in the suburbs of Shanghai also reduced wheat production by half due to a rainstorm. Conversely, by strengthening field management and disaster prevention work, even if severe disasters constantly threaten, it can still guarantee increased production. The bumper harvest of early rice in 1958 is an example. At that time, varying degrees of drought occurred in the early rice areas of the south, and the drought in Yunnan Province was unprecedented in sixty years. However, because various places built dams to block rivers, opened springs to divert water, and tried every means, they finally overcame the drought. This year, early rice not only did not reduce its harvest as in previous years, but also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This also shows that strengthening late-stage management and fully exerting subjective initiative still has great potential.

　　Of course, to strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields and strive for a greater harvest, it is also necessary to carry out a series of organizational work and mobilize the vast number of commune members to think of ways together. The West View Production Team of Yeshan Commune in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, mobilized commune members to discuss and come up with four methods: First, establish a technical research team to specialize in the late-stage management of wheat; second, further implement the production responsibility system, commend good ones and criticize bad ones; third, high-yield fields should do a good job in rust prevention and lodging prevention, and third-class wheat should be re-fertilized once; the fertilization method is to lightly step and sprinkle by hand along the ridges; fourth, organize special personnel to watch the weather, listen to the radio, and strictly prevent the attack of disasters. These are all positive and feasible methods.

　　Time is already very tight. In Jianghuai area, wheat will begin to be harvested in half a month or twenty days; in one month, the northern area will also be harvested. Leading comrades in various places should immediately work hard with the vast number of grassroots cadres and commune members for half a month or twenty days, do a good job in the late-stage management of wheat fields, and strive for a greater harvest on the existing basis.

### 再努一把力，争取小麦更大丰收

　　再努一把力，争取小麦更大丰收
    经过去冬今春的一场苦战，全国三亿三千多万亩的小麦已经胜利地通过了返青关和拔节关，现正抽穗灌浆。从南到北，小麦都生长良好。广大农民半年来的辛勤劳动，已经开出了灿烂的花朵。
    从当前小麦生长情况来看，丰收的条件是具备的。“麦收三个宝，头多、穗大、籽粒饱。”今年的头比去年的多，穗也比去年的大。据陕西省统计，一类麦有一千二百多万亩，占麦田总数的52.2％，每亩有四十万穗。二类麦有八百万亩，占麦田总数的34.8％，每亩有三十万穗左右。三类麦三百万亩，占麦田总数13％，每亩也有二十万穗左右；而去年一般的麦田每亩只有二十万穗左右。今年的小麦不但穗长穗多，而且秆子粗壮，叶子发黑，生长旺盛。从这些情形来看，只要今后几十天中没有严重的自然灾害，丰收是很有希望的。
    但是，小麦的生长还没有停止，小麦的丰收还没有定局。目前，长江流域的小麦正在灌浆，北方地区的小麦正在抽穗，正是小麦生长成熟的关键时期。小麦从抽穗、开花、授粉以至结籽，都还不能完全决定最后的收成。因为籽粒有饱有瘦，有大有小，长得饱满的籽粒，一万三、四千粒就有一斤重，而瘦小的籽粒，要两万粒才有一斤，相差是很悬殊的。而要粒粒饱满，就在于在此关键时期给以足够的养分和水分。因此，在这个时期，应当再努一把力，加强麦田后期管理，争取穗穗都是籽多粒饱，全国就可以增产几十亿斤甚至成百亿斤的小麦。认为小麦的丰收已经定局而放松后期管理，这种思想显然是消极的，要不得的。
    从今年小麦生长的情况来说，特别需要加强后期管理工作，这是因为：一、今年各地都搞了小麦大面积丰产田，这是今年的新事物。如何管好大面积丰产田，我们还没有经验。因此，在小麦的生长后期，怎能放松麦田管理呢？二、今年普遍实行了密植，麦子密度大，就需要更多的水和更多的肥。据农业科学试验，从抽穗到成熟这一阶段，时间虽然短，但需要的水量特别多，约占全部需水量的40％。这是因为小麦进入灌浆期以后，所有器官生长都已经结束，茎叶中由于光合作用所制造的养分，一直向籽粒中输送，而输送工作必须靠水分来进行，水分不足，运输就会不畅，因此也必须迅速加强麦田的后期管理。
    也有人有这样一种顾虑：再追肥、灌水，恐怕麦子要贪青徒长。这是不必要的忧虑。麦子同稻子不一样，稻子贪青要减产，麦子贪青不影响产量。中国有这样一句谚语：“谷返（即贪青）不见面，麦返一包面”。事实也是这样的。山东省历城港沟公社去年4月底给麦子多追了一次肥，多浇了一次水，每亩就多打了三十多斤小麦。
    要争取小麦更大的丰收，还要时刻准备着与自然灾害作斗争。常有这样的情形：明明麦子长的很好，但是一场灾害的袭击，不仅不能增产，还要减产。1956年皖北地区小麦本来长得很好，丰收在望，但在灌浆时期遭受了一场阴雨、热风和秆锈病的灾害，就减产30％—50％。不久以前，上海市郊“七一”公社华一生产队也因为遭到一场暴风雨，就使小麦减产一半。反之，加强了田间管理工作和防灾工作，即使严重的灾害不断威胁，也能保证增产。1958年早稻大丰收就是个例子。当时南方早稻地区一般都发生了不同程度的干旱，云南省的干旱更是六十年来没有过的。但因各地拦河打坝，开泉引水，千方百计，终于战胜了干旱。这一年，早稻不仅没有像往年一样减收，而且获得了空前的大丰收。这也说明，加强后期管理，充分发挥主观能动性，还大有可为。
    当然，要加强麦田后期管理，争取更大丰收，还需要作一系列的组织工作，发动广大社员一起想办法。陕西省大荔县业善公社西观生产队就发动社员讨论出了四点办法：一是成立一个技术研究小组，专门研究小麦后期管理问题；二是进一步贯彻生产责任制，对好的表扬，不好的批评；三是丰产田要做好防锈、防倒工作，三类麦全部再施一次追肥；施肥方法是用手顺垅轻踏轻撒；四是组织专人看天气，听广播，严防灾害的袭击。这些都是积极的可行的办法。
    时间已经非常紧迫，江淮地区再过半个月或二十天，就要开始收麦；还有一个月时间，北方地区的也要收割了。各地领导同志应该立即同广大基层干部和社员，大干半月或二十天，做好麦田后期管理工作，在现有的基础上，争取更大的丰收。
