New Developments at the Mang River
　　Our reporters Lu Xiaoping and Hao Jian

In late spring, April, at the Mang River Steel Plant nestled at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, rows of neat iron-smelting furnaces send plumes of thick smoke into the sky all day long. The deafening roar of machinery, accompanied by the whooshing of the furnace fires, echoes non-stop day and night. Near the furnaces, in the Kongshan and Dalingtang areas, the sound of blasting for mining is constant. The area holds approximately 25 million tons of hematite ore, with an iron content of 40％—60％. The coal mined from the Kejing Coal Mine around the furnaces piles up like mountains. On the several roads leading from the earthen furnaces to the coal and iron mines, cars and horse-drawn carts, trailing long tails of dust, shuttle back and forth ceaselessly.

The Best Method

Once the decision was made to establish this small, earthen-furnace-based steel production site, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party assigned Jiyuan County the task of producing 30,000 tons of iron in 1959. The Jiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after calculating the magnitude of the task, wondered how many furnaces would need to be built and how many laborers would be required to complete it. What to do? The best method was to mobilize the workers to reform the furnace designs.

One day, Shi Dexiang, a skilled iron smelter from the Mang River workshop known for his plow-surface furnaces, saw a water turbine driving six iron-smelting furnaces. He thought, "Doesn't this scatter the wind power? If the furnaces were made larger and a single water turbine was used for blowing air, wouldn't more iron be produced?"

While contemplating this, Shi Dexiang began sketching a furnace design on the ground. He thought: "If the belly of the plow-surface furnace were expanded, wouldn't it be able to 'eat more and pull more'?" Together with another veteran worker, he toiled for a day, building a furnace four feet high with a volume of 1.5 cubic meters out of mud and refractory clay. The next day, the furnace was ignited, and over 800 jin of iron were produced on the first day. Subsequently, the output rose to 1,700 jin, reaching a maximum of 7,200 jin, an increase of more than tenfold compared to the original plow-surface furnace. Everyone happily nicknamed it the "Big Belly Furnace." From then on, the output of the Mang River Steel Plant increased day by day.

Marching Towards High Output

Despite the high output of the Big Belly Furnace, the workers were not content to rest on their laurels. They continued to rack their brains, striving to increase the furnace utilization coefficient in order to achieve even higher output.

In February of this year, Guo Fayan, the furnace leader of Furnace No. 1 in the Xinzhuang workshop, took the lead in sounding the call to march towards high output. At a general meeting, he proposed that their 1.4-cubic-meter Big Furnace, powered by a 20-horsepower gas engine, could guarantee a daily output of 10,000 jin. This immediately caused a sensation throughout the workshop. What a huge number! In the past, an output of 6,000 or 7,000 jin was considered quite a lot, but now they were actually aiming for 10,000 jin a day! How could this not attract attention? Worker Kong Qingping asked him, "What's your basis for saying you can produce 10,000 jin a day?" Guo Fayan replied, "What's the basis? In the past, the ore grade was not high, it wasn't roasted, and the particle size after crushing wasn't uniform enough. If we overcome these weaknesses, producing 10,000 jin a day will definitely be no problem." His words served as a reminder, and the next day, many workers used their spare time to personally select ore at the mine. Guo Jin'e led the women in crushing the roasted ore to the size of walnuts, and then sifting it all. On the day they vowed to seize 10,000 jin of iron, the gas engine operator, Shang Xinfu, also went full throttle, increasing the operating speed from 290 revolutions per minute to 350 revolutions per minute, quickly shortening the tapping time from 40 minutes to 30 minutes, then to 20 minutes. This kept the workers extremely busy. The charging workers had barely finished charging the furnace when the furnace-front workers were already shouting that it was time to tap the iron, and they needed help dragging away the hot iron blocks. The mold makers were so busy that they had to ask for outside assistance. Twenty-four hours later, the inspectors from the factory arrived. They weighed piece after piece, and when the last piece of iron was carried away, the total was calculated to be 10,552 jin, with some of it being gray pig iron. Guo Fayan smiled happily because they had won the county's high-output red flag. While Furnace No. 1 in the Xinzhuang workshop was struggling to produce 10,000 jin of iron a day, workers from the surrounding workshops rushed to observe like watching a "foreign movie." Zhou Beiyu, the furnace leader of Furnace No. 6 in the Dayu workshop, who had come with a skeptical attitude, calculated the tapping time after seeing it and turned away. He immediately returned and mobilized the masses to march towards 10,000 jin. As a result, they achieved a daily output of 11,165 jin, truly a victory following victory.

Everyone Concerned About Costs

The quality of the iron they produced was so good, yet the cost was very low. In March, the average cost of iron per ton for the entire plant was 187.7 yuan, with the Xinzhuang workshop reaching 147 yuan. Their costs were so low because the plant implemented independent accounting at the workshop level and launched a campaign to increase production and practice thrift.

When implementing independent accounting, the Xinzhuang workshop formulated various quotas and overproduction reward methods, which stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for technical innovation. Mining, transportation, and crushing all broke the quotas daily. Although the number of personnel in March was one-third less than in February, the output increased by nearly one-half compared to February. In order to reduce raw material consumption, workers hung a material consumption card in front of each furnace, recording the amount of material used and the amount of iron produced in each shift. If the furnace leader saw that a shift used more material but produced less iron, they would investigate the root cause and try to find a solution. One day, the workshop Party Secretary discovered from the material consumption cards that Furnace No. 1 had an advanced experience of using only 1.3 tons of coal per ton of iron due to increasing the roasting temperature of the ore. He immediately promoted this experience, resulting in the entire workshop's coal consumption decreasing from four tons of coal per ton of iron to 1.6 tons. Here, you could see many workers carrying cloth bags on their backs, holding small hammers in their hands, turning over the tailings. What were they doing? They were the team picking out unburnt coal and collecting scrap iron. Now, the entire workshop has formed a upsurge in everyone managing finances and everyone controlling costs.

Now, the workers of the Mang River Steel Plant are advancing victoriously. They have absorbed the advantages of both foreign and domestic furnaces and have built a type of furnace that is "foreign-dressed" on the outside but still fundamentally an earthen furnace. They are producing more, better quality, and lower-cost pig iron for the country.

Here, the flowers, trees, and fruit trees planted along the workers' residences and roads have already blossomed and borne fruit. The Mang River Steel Plant is filled with a thriving scene everywhere.

    漭河新事
    本报记者　陆笑萍　郝健
    暮春4月，位于太行山下的漭河钢铁厂里，一排排整齐的炼铁炉，整天浓烟缭绕，遮蔽天空。震耳欲耸的机器声伴随着呼呼的炉火声，昼夜响个不停。在炉群附近的孔山、大岭堂一带，也不断传来了开矿的爆炸声，那里蕴藏的赤铁矿约有二千五百万吨，含铁量达到40％—60％。炉群周围的克井煤矿，开采出来的煤炭堆积如山。从土炉通往煤矿、铁矿的几条公路上，汽车、马车拖着长长的尘土尾巴，川流不息地奔跑着。
    最好的办法
    这个小土炉群的钢铁基地一确定下来，中共新乡地委就给了济源县1959年产三万吨铁的任务。中共济源县委一计算，完成这么大的任务，要建多少座炉子，要多少劳力才能完成啊！怎么办？最好的办法就是发动职工改革炉型。
    有一天，漭河车间的老犁面炉炼铁能手史德祥，看见一个水轮机带动六个炼铁炉，他心里想，这样不是分散了风力吗？假若把炉子改得大一些，用一个水轮机鼓风，一定会多出铁。
    史德祥一面想一面就动手在地上设计炉型，他想：假若把犁面炉的腹部扩大，不是可以“多吃多拉”吗？他同另一个老工人一起经过一天的苦战，用泥巴和耐火土建成了一座四尺高、容积一点五立方公尺的炉子。第二天，炉子点火了，头一天就出了八百多斤铁，接着产量上升到一千七百斤，最高达到七千二百斤，比原来犁面炉的产量提高了十几倍，大家都高兴地给他起了个名字叫做“大肚炉”。从此，漭河钢铁厂的产量就日日上升了。
    向高产进军
    大肚炉的产量虽这么高，工人们并没有以此为满足，接着他们又挖空心思，以提高炉子的利用系数，来夺取更高的产量。
    在今年2月间，辛庄车间一号炉炉长郭法彦首先吹起了向高产进军的号角。他在一次大会上提出，他们用二十马力煤气机带动的一点四立方公尺的大炉子，保证日产万斤，这一下子轰动了整个车间，好大的一个数字啊！在过去，日产六、七千斤就有人感到不少了，而现在居然要日产万斤，这怎能不使人注意呢！工人孔庆平问他：“日产万斤你有啥根据？”郭法彦说：“有啥根据？过去矿石品位不高，没有焙烧，粉碎粒度又不够均匀。如果把这些薄弱的环节克服了，日产万斤一定没问题。”经他这么一提醒，第二天，许多工人便利用工余时间亲自到矿山去精选矿石，郭金娥带领着妇女把焙烧的矿石破碎得像核桃一般大，并全部过了筛。在他们誓夺万斤铁的那天，煤气机手尚新福也开足了马力，使运转速度由原来一分钟二百九十转提高到三百五十转，出铁时间很快的由四十分缩短到三十分、二十分。这一下可把工人忙坏了，上料工刚刚把料上完，炉前工就在叫喊着，出铁时间到了，要他帮助把一块块热铁拖走；做砂模的因为忙不过来，还不得不向外求援。二十四个小时后，厂里验收的人来了，称过了一块又一块，当最后的一块铁被抬走时，一合算，是一万零五百五十二斤，并且有一部分是灰生铁。郭法彦高兴地笑了，因为他们夺取了全县的高产红旗。辛庄车间一号炉正为日产万斤铁艰苦奋斗的时候，周围车间的工人们，像看“西洋景”那样都纷纷赶来参观，原来带着怀疑心情前来参观的大峪车间六号炉炉长周备玉，看到他们出铁的时间，心里一计算，扭头就走。他回去马上发动群众向万斤进军。结果达到日产一万一千一百六十五斤，真是胜利一个接着一个。
    人人关心成本
    他们生产的铁，质量这样好，但成本却很低。3月份全厂每吨铁的成本平均一百八十七元七角，其中辛庄车间达到了一百四十七元，他的成本这么低，是因为这个厂以车间为单位实行了独立核算，开展了增产节约运动。
    辛庄车间在实行独立核算的时候，就制定了各种定额和超产奖励的办法鼓舞了群众改革技术的热情，采矿、运输、粉碎日日突破定额，3月份的人员虽比2月份减少了三分之一，而产量却比2月份增加近二分之一。工人们为了降低原材料消耗，在每个炉子的前面都挂上了一个用料卡片，把每班用料和出铁的数量记在上面，炉长看到那个班用料多，出铁少，就来追根究底，设法解决。有一天，车间党委书记从用料卡片上发现一号炉由于焙烧矿石提高了温度，一吨铁只用了一点三吨煤的先进经验后，立即进行推广，结果使全车间的煤耗，由一吨铁四吨煤炭下降到一比一点六。在这里，你可以看到不少工人，背着个布口袋，手里拿着小锤，在翻浆倒渣。他们在干什么哩？原来这就是拣乏炭，拾碎铁的队伍。现在整个车间已经形成了人人办财务，个个管成本的热潮了。
    现在，漭河钢铁厂的工人们正乘胜前进，他们吸取了洋炉和土炉的优点，已建成了一种土炉洋装的炉子。为国家生产出数量更多、质量更好、成本更低的生铁。
    这里，在工人住宅和道路两旁种植的花木和果树，已经开花结果了。漭河钢铁厂到处充满了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
