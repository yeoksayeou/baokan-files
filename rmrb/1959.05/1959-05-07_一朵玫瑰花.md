　　A Rose
　　Yang Guanghai
    I received a letter from the distant frontier, with a rose tucked inside. The Tibetan girl, Ciren Yongzhen, wrote in the letter: Uncle, do you remember this rose? We took a photo in front of its flowers...

    This happened five years ago.

    In the golden autumn, I rode a horse from Qamdo, crossed several snow-capped mountains, and arrived in Batang after traversing the vast grasslands, lodging at a Tibetan home.

    The head of the household consisted of an old woman and her granddaughter, who was not yet twelve years old. The old woman's hair was already gray, her back a bit hunched, and she walked with a trembling gait. She always liked to chat with me about her family affairs. The first sentence was always: "Today we live such a good life, all thanks to Chairman Mao." When she talked about the past, it was always a few sighs of "Ah, ah, ah," followed by tears falling like rain!

    This place is known as the "Jiangnan of the Kangzang Plateau," a beautiful and rich area. It abounds in various fruits. Every family has an orchard, every household a flower garden. Who would have thought that the home of snow and grasslands would have such a charming place.

    But despite the beautiful scenery, the fate of the Tibetan people in the past was very tragic!

    More than a decade ago, the old woman's son was conscripted to perform corvée labor, carrying loads of goods, crossing snowy mountains, and traversing endless grasslands, never to be heard from again, his fate unknown. The daughter-in-law was very beautiful, and was raped by the steward, then stabbed to death with a knife. The old woman endured hunger and cold, raising her granddaughter. When the highland barley ripened, basket after basket was carried into the Lama temple; when the apples ripened, crate after crate was sent into the Lama temple, and even the little bit of yak butter they had was used to light the Buddha lamps. They ate only boiled wild vegetables at home. That's how they survived the long years.

    In 1952, before the People's Liberation Army entered Batang, little Ciren Yongzhen contracted edema and was on the verge of death. This family was about to be wiped out! But the savior came; the doctors of the People's Liberation Army treated Ciren Yongzhen, gave her injections, and her illness slowly improved. When the old woman told me about this, she cried with emotion. At this time, Ciren Yongzhen came home from school, singing "The East is Red." She was already a third-grade student.

    The old woman said she looked just like her mother: dark eyes, long eyelashes, and a pretty face. When she saw her grandmother with tears in her eyes, she knew what her grandmother had told me. Perhaps to make her grandmother happy, she said: "Before the People's Liberation Army came, the roses in our flower garden withered and hadn't bloomed for many years. When the People's Liberation Army came to Batang, there was a sudden downpour, and the roses were saved just like us. The next year, they sprouted new buds, and the flowers bloomed more and more vividly, more and more vigorously." She said, "Let me and the People's Liberation Army uncle take a picture in front of the flowers." I happily agreed.

    After that, I lived among them for a long time. The old woman treated me like her own son. Once when I was sick, the old woman took care of me like a loving mother, afraid that I wouldn't be used to eating zanba, she specially borrowed some rice to cook thin porridge for me. She sat by my bed every day, muttering something. Little Ciren Yongzhen would put red and large apples by my pillow every day.

    The moonlight shone through the cracks in the door, illuminating the pillow. The evening breeze carried the fragrance of roses. All around was quiet, only the slender fruit tree branches swayed in the breeze; the purplish-red apples shimmered silver in the moonlight. I thought of the old woman's motherly love, thinking of their painful past life....

    Now, I look at the letter from afar, looking at this rose. I seem to smell its fragrance, see its bright colors.

    Now, Tibet has truly been reborn, and the Tibetan people have truly stood up! Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they will break free from their shackles, completely shake off the serf system, and build a socialist happy life together with all the ethnic groups of the motherland.

    Let the roses bloom all over the Himalayas, bloom along the banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, bloom all over the vast grasslands!

### 一朵玫瑰花

　　一朵玫瑰花
　　杨光海
    我接到从遥远的边疆寄来的一封信，信里还夹着一朵玫瑰花。藏族小姑娘慈仁雍珍在信上写着：叔叔，你还记得这玫瑰花么？我们曾在它的花丛前照过像哩……
    这是五年前的事了。
    在金黄色的秋天，我骑马从昌都出发，翻过几座雪山，走过辽阔无垠的草原来到巴塘，借宿在藏胞家里。
    这家的主人，只有一个老太太和一个不满十二岁的孙女。老太太头发已经斑白，背有点驼，走起路来颤巍巍的。有事没事，她总喜欢给我摆摆家常。开头一句，总是说：“今天过这样好的日子，全托毛主席的福。”一谈到过去，又总是“唉，唉，唉”的几声叹息，跟着眼泪就刷刷的落下来了！
    这里被称为“康藏高原的江南”，是个美丽富饶的地方。盛产各种水果。家家有果园，户户有花坛。谁能想到雪和草原的家乡，还有这样迷人的地方。
    但是景色虽美，藏族人民过去的命运却很悲惨！
    十多年前，老太太的儿子被拉去支差，背着一驮驮的货物，翻过重重雪山，走过漫无边际的草原，杳无音讯，不知死活。儿媳妇长得很有姿色，被管家奸污了，然后被用刀子戳死。老太太忍饥受冻地熬着，抚养着孙女。青稞成熟了，一箩箩背进喇嘛庙；苹果成熟了，一筐筐送进喇嘛庙，仅有的一点酥油也拿去点佛灯了。家里吃的只是清水野菜。就这样她们熬过了漫长的岁月。
    在1952年，解放军没有进驻巴塘之前，小慈仁雍珍得了肿病，命在旦夕。这家人眼看就要断根了！可是救命恩人来了，解放军的医生给慈仁雍珍看病，打了针，病就慢慢好了。老太太跟我说到这件事情时，激动得哭了。这时慈仁雍珍嘴里唱着“东方红”放学回来。她已是小学三年级的学生了。
    老奶奶说她和妈妈长的一个模样：乌黑的眼睛，长长的睫毛，俊俏的脸。她看到奶奶噙着泪花，就知道奶奶给我讲了什么。也许为了叫奶奶高兴些，她说：“解放军没有来到之前，我们花坛上的玫瑰枯死了，好几年都没有开花。解放军来到巴塘，突然下了一场大雨，玫瑰也像我们一样得救了。第二年就发出了嫩芽，花越开越艳，越开越旺。”她说：“让我和解放军叔叔在花前照个像吧。”我高兴地答应了。
    此后，我很长时间生活在她们中间。老太太把我当做自己的儿子一样看待。有一次我病了，老太太真像慈母般地照顾我，怕我吃不惯?粑，特地借了一点米给我煮稀粥吃。天天坐在我床边，念叨着什么。慈仁雍珍小妹妹则天天给我在枕头边放些又红又大的苹果。
    月光从门缝里透进来，照在枕头上。晚风送来了玫瑰花的清香。四周是一片静谧，只有亭亭玉立的果树的枝叶在微风中摇曳；紫红色的苹果在月下银光闪闪。我想着老太太慈母般的抚爱，想着她们过去痛苦的生活……。
    现在，我看着遥远的来信，看着这朵玫瑰花。我像是闻到了它的幽香，看到它鲜艳的色彩。
    现在，西藏已经真正新生了，藏族人民真正站起来了！他们要在共产党和毛主席的领导下，挣脱枷锁，彻底摆脱农奴制度，和祖国各族人民一起建设社会主义的幸福生活。
    让玫瑰花开遍喜马拉雅山，开遍雅鲁藏布江两岸，开遍辽阔的草原吧！
