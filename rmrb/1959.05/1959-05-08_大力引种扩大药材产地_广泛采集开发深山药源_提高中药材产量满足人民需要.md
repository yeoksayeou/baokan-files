Vigorously Introduce and Expand Medicinal Material Production Areas; Widely Collect and Develop Medicinal Resources in Deep Mountains
    Increase Chinese Herbal Medicine Output to Meet People's Needs

    (By Our Correspondent) Various agricultural and forestry, health, and commercial departments are collaborating to ensure that this year's output of Chinese herbal medicines meets the needs of the broad masses of the people. It is estimated that the national planting area of ​​medicinal materials this year will increase by more than two times compared with last year, and the amount of purchases will also increase by more than one time compared with last year.

    Since the State Council issued instructions on the production of Chinese herbal medicines in November last year, party committees in various regions have earnestly strengthened their leadership over the production of medicinal materials, incorporating medicinal material production into agricultural production plans. The national plan calls for a planting area of 7.2 million mu of medicinal materials this year. Many major varieties, such as Rehmannia glutinosa and Atractylodes macrocephala, which were previously concentrated in one or two provinces, have now been successfully introduced in Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Hubei provinces, and large-scale planting has begun. In terms of wild medicinal materials, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan have recently organized a large number of people to conduct investigations and collections in deep mountains and old forests. Last year, Sichuan Province organized the masses to collect more than one million dan of wild medicinal materials and found large new medicinal material mountains in Xichang and Ya'an special districts and the three ethnic autonomous prefectures of Ganzi, Aba, and Liangshan. Yunnan Province has discovered the most new medicinal resources, including Marsdenia tenacissima for eliminating the four pests, as well as Terminalia chebula, Polygonatum sibiricum, and Dioscorea polystachya, and other valuable medicines. In the past, the Agarwood used to treat qi pain and other diseases in our country was entirely dependent on imports from foreign countries. Recently, large reserves have been discovered in Guangdong and Guangxi. Because the production of Chinese herbal medicines still cannot keep up with market demand, especially with the collection and promotion of a large number of TCM effective prescriptions and the development of the mass movement of Western medicine practitioners learning Chinese medicine, the demand for Chinese medicine is increasing day by day. Chinese herbal medicine production throughout the country is actively implementing the policy of "walking on two legs," on the one hand, universally developing the introduction and cultivation of medicinal materials in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions with suitable conditions, and on the other hand, expanding the production bases of "authentic medicinal materials," both grasping the transformation of wild medicinal materials into domestic cultivation and paying attention to the continued collection and protection of wild medicinal resources. At present, various regions have adopted a method combining mobilizing the masses and organizing professional production teams to continue organizing the collection and general survey of wild medicinal materials. At the same time, the plans for the area, varieties, and quantity of medicinal materials to be planted have been implemented layer by layer from the province, special district, and county levels down to the people's communes to ensure the completion of this year's plan. The seeds, labor, and technical forces needed for planting medicinal materials are being comprehensively arranged in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. In terms of seeds, various regions have mutually adjusted more than 310 varieties, totaling 2.4 million jin. Regarding the technology and experience of planting medicinal materials, relevant commercial, health, agricultural, and forestry departments in various provinces have organized personnel to assist people's communes in summarizing and promoting them. Some places have also actively adopted measures such as running training courses or sending people to fraternal provinces to study, striving to master Chinese medicinal material cultivation techniques more quickly.

    大力引种扩大药材产地　广泛采集开发深山药源
    提高中药材产量满足人民需要
    本报讯　各地有关农林、卫生和商业部门协作，争取今年我国中药材的产量满足广大人民的需要。预计今年全国中药种植面积约比去年增加两倍以上，收购也将比去年增加一倍多。
    从去年11月国务院发出关于中药材生产问题的指示后，各地党委都认真加强对中药材生产的领导，把药材生产纳入农业生产计划。全国计划今年药材种植面积为七百二十万亩。过去集中在一两个省生产的生地、白术等许多主要品种，现在安徽、陕西、甘肃、四川、山西、湖北各省都已普遍引种成功，并且开始大面积种植。在野生药材方面，四川、云南、广东、广西、湖南最近几个月来，都组织了大批人力到深山老林进行调查和采集。四川省去年组织群众采集的野生药材共一百万担以上，并在西昌、雅安专区和甘孜、阿坝、凉山三个民族自治州，找到了大片新的药材山。云南省发现的新药源最多，其中有除四害用的马兹子，以及柯子、玉京、黄山药等贵重药物。过去我国治疗气痛病等常用的沉香，完全靠从国外进口，最近在广东、广西都发现有大量的蕴藏。由于目前中药材生产仍赶不上市场的需要，特别是大量中医验方的搜集、推广和西医学习中医的群众运动的开展，中药的需要量更日益增大。全国各地中药材生产都在积极贯彻两条腿走路的方针，一面在有条件的省、市、自治区普遍发展引种药材，一面又扩大“地道药材”的生产基地，既抓紧变野生药材为家种家养，又重视继续采集和保护野生药源。目前各地已采取发动群众与组织专业生产队相结合的办法，继续组织野生药材的采集和普查，同时将种植药材的面积、品种、数量计划，从省、专区、县到人民公社层层落实，确保今年计划的完成。当前种植药材所需要的种籽、劳动力以及技术力量，各省、市、自治区正在全面安排。在种籽方面，各地已互相调剂了三百一十多种品种，合计二百四十万斤；对于种植药材的技术和经验，已由各省经营药材的有关商业、卫生、农林部门组织人员，协助人民公社进行总结推广，有的地方还积极采取开办训练班或派人到兄弟省学习等措施，争取更快地掌握中药材的栽培技术。
