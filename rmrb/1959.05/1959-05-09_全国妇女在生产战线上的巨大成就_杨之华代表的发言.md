Comrades,
I fully endorse the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Rejoicing that Tibetan Sisters are Moving Towards a New Life

Our millions of female workers and ninety million workers' family members, like the vast majority of people across the country, are extremely indignant at the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique. Female workers across the country firmly support all the measures taken by the State Council to quell the Tibetan rebellion, and are delighted to see that the Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, and that Tibetan sisters and brothers will henceforth be liberated from the shackles of the most brutal and dark serf system, and move towards a bright, free, and happy new life at an early date.

Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory, as is known to all, both at home and abroad, throughout history. However, British imperialism and foreign reactionaries colluded with the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique to instigate rebellion and openly support it. Some reactionary newspapers and journals in India echoed and slanderously smeared our country in order to coordinate the rebellion, plotting to separate Tibet from our motherland and once again place our Tibetan people under the rule of imperialism and reactionary forces. This conspiracy is a naked exposure of expansionist ambitions, and a very base and arrogant criminal act.

However, what is particularly surprising is that some leading figures in the Indian government have also made statements that distort the facts. Mrs. Indira Gandhi, President of the Indian National Congress, openly referred to our Tibet as a "country." Mrs. Kripalani, General Secretary of the National Congress, has also repeatedly slandered our country by using the Tibetan rebellion incident, absurdly claiming the Tibetan rebellion as a "just cause." The Indian government has repeatedly stated that Tibet is part of Chinese territory and that India has no territorial or political ambitions in Tibet. But how can such absurd remarks made by ladies in the Indian government be described as ignorance? Besides saying that they are determined to undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, that they are harming the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, what other judgment can be made? They are wearing beautiful peacock feathers but making crowing sounds, which makes us suspect that they have ulterior motives. What is especially intolerable is that in Bombay, India, our friendly neighbor, in front of our consulate in India, so-called "demonstrators" are wantonly insulting the portrait of Chairman Mao, who is loved by our 600 million people. Insulting Chairman Mao is the greatest insult to the 600 million Chinese people. Under the connivance of the Indian police authorities, such criminal activities are carried out. Can this be explained in any way from the Indian government's repeated emphasis on Sino-Indian friendship? I want to express a serious protest on behalf of the national female workers regarding the responsibility for this incident! I want to warn all imperialists and foreign reactionaries: Tibet will always be Chinese Tibet, and the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will not allow you to undermine! The vast number of just people in China and India are watching you with sharp eyes. Quickly withdraw your dirty hands and feet! Any conspiracy to split China's territory and alienate the unity of the one billion Chinese and Indian people is bound to be abandoned and annihilated by the people. Anyone with ambition will inevitably bring about their own destruction and eventually suffer the destined failure.

Women's Movement Enters a New Historical Stage

Now, I would like to talk about some issues and opinions related to female workers and workers' family members participating in social labor.

Since 1958, under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction, the women's movement has also leaped forward to a new stage of historical development. The most significant fact is that, with the vast number of women on the agricultural front marching towards nature on a large scale, the number of female workers participating in the industrial front has more than doubled the total number of female workers in 1957. While urban street women are participating in social labor, workers' family members in industrial and mining enterprises have also universally and extensively set up processing factories and collective undertakings that serve the society. This is a major change. This change is a very gratifying phenomenon for us who have personally experienced the suffering of the old society. It is by no means simple that women can participate in production and construction on such an unprecedented scale. This is a great victory for the Party's leadership and the Party's women's movement policy, and it is the inevitable result of the development of socialist construction in our country. Chairman Mao said: "Chinese women are a great human resource. This resource must be developed and used to build a great socialist country." This important inspiration pointed out the direction for us and gave us unlimited encouragement and strength. The socialist system itself and the development of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture last year, and the realization of people's communes have opened up broad paths for our women to participate in labor production. The vast number of women originally had an urgent desire to devote themselves to the great socialist cause. After the nationwide rectification movement, they further liberated their minds and improved their political and ideological awareness. All of this has created extremely favorable conditions for women to participate in social labor.

What particularly moved us was that, in order to develop production and thoroughly liberate women, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his busy work, found leaders at all levels of the Party and heads of mass organizations to study the organization of life while organizing production. He attached great importance to women's issues and personally went deep among the masses, kindly inquiring about the situation of grassroots cadres and women. Comrade Shaoqi also specifically talked about many methods, asking women whether they could set up factories, shops, schools, and collective welfare undertakings, etc. Comrade Shaoqi's short remarks spoke the words in the hearts of women and illuminated the hearts of women. The women responded to the Party with a loud voice: We can do it! They participated in industrial and mining production and social service undertakings with joy. Under the Party's warm care and great appeal, the strength of the vast number of women poured out like water that has burst its banks.

Female Workers Displayed Intelligence and Creativity to Create Miracles

Female workers in enterprises have demonstrated their intelligence and creativity, and have continued to create miracles in the technical revolution movement. All the female workers in the Southwest Radio Equipment Factory in Sichuan proposed 200,000 suggestions for technical innovation last year, and overfulfilled the annual Leap Forward plan by 45.87% 64 days ahead of schedule. Like our representative here, Wei Fengying, successfully trial-produced more than 20 new products and led the entire group of 16 workers to achieve 105 technical transformations, creating 400,000 yuan of wealth for the country; improved a stamping die, saving four labor forces and increasing efficiency by 700 times; and completed the task of the second Five-Year Plan in four months last year. She said: "During the Great Leap Forward, my heart cannot be calm, my blood is boiling." This reflects the feelings of many female workers! Li Fengqin, a female worker at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, changed a part of the generator to mechanized manufacturing, increasing efficiency by 20 times. Thousands of advanced female workers have emerged in various places and have been warmly praised by the people. They are called "Iron Girls," "Mu Guiying," or "Liu Hulan" advanced collectives. The thirteen female salespersons in the Tianqiao Store are all advanced workers. During the Great Leap Forward, all the female workers worked with soaring energy and completed the national plan excellently together with the male workers.

Workers' Family Members Participating in Social Labor Have Been Tempered

The vast number of workers' family members participated in social labor and made important contributions to supporting production and construction. Under the slogan of "Not for fame, not for profit, but wholeheartedly for socialism," and "Whatever the factory needs, we will do," they pooled their efforts and started from scratch, using their hard work to set up many satellite factories and life service societies. They picked up bricks, pulled out nails, and used waste wood to build processing factories, workshops, dormitories, canteens, etc., creating a lot of wealth for the country.

Women have been tempered in labor, and their spirits have also undergone extremely profound changes. A newly employed female worker wrote a poem: "The Communist Party leads the overthrow of the three great mountains, women's bodies are liberated and see the blue sky, only housework binds the body, making the heart annoyed and frowning. The general line shines brightly, women are liberated for the second time and rejoice, eating rice and not forgetting those who grow the grain, working with soaring energy to engage in production." This fully expresses the joy of the vast number of women who have been liberated from housework, love the Party, and love socialist construction. In order to build socialism faster, better, and more economically, many female workers are in high spirits, high morale, working without conditions, and laboring without pay, showing a high degree of communist consciousness. Like Xiang Xiuli, a young female worker in Guangzhou, who gave her life to protect state property, is the most glorious image of women in New China.

The great achievements created by the vast number of women on the industrial front and the revolutionary energy they have demonstrated have increasingly shown their great role in socialist construction. In order to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959, ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the industrial production tasks in the 1959 national economic plan, we should consolidate and strengthen this labor army and give fuller play to their enthusiasm and creativity.

Help Women Engage in Labor Production Better

To enable women to stand firmly in their production positions and actively engage in labor, they need to be given necessary assistance in all aspects. It should be admitted that, due to historical and social reasons, some female workers have relatively low political awareness and technical and cultural levels. Among female workers, especially new female workers, housework and children often affect production and various spare-time studies. However, for the needs of production and socialist development, we must continue to work hard to cultivate and support this indispensable force. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, we must strengthen ideological education for female workers and improve their political awareness; mobilize experienced workers to help them quickly master technology; organize them to work hard to improve their cultural level; and especially help female workers solve special difficulties. In short, we must not only teach them knowledge about production and life but also help them solve specific problems. In production, we must encourage all female workers to learn from advanced workers through competition and appraisal, and raise them to the level of advanced producers. Wei Fengying said well, "In the new situation, to continue to leap forward, I deeply feel that it is limited to just ponder inventions and creations by myself, and everyone should be mobilized. The more people, the greater the power." Female workers account for one-third of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, and they organized a "Clever Girls Competition," and 1,181 "Clever Girls" emerged in the entire factory, creating a lot of wealth for the country in increasing production and practicing economy. This shows that there is a huge potential hidden among women. As long as we mobilize women and create the necessary conditions for them to work with peace of mind, they can not only consolidate their participation in production but will also make outstanding achievements together with all the workers.

Rely on the Masses to Run Collective Welfare Undertakings Well

To run collective welfare undertakings on a large scale, and to run them well, so that housework is socialized, the experience is to rely on the masses, in line with the principle of adapting to local conditions, making use of simple and crude materials, and running undertakings diligently and thriftily, and first run public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc. well. In the few years after the liberation of Tianjin, in order to solve the difficulties of female workers, the state invested in 542 nurseries and kindergartens, taking in 29,906 children, but it still could not meet the objective needs. However, last year, relying on the masses to run them themselves, there were 6,278, taking in 161,621 children. This is enough to prove that the benefits of relying on the masses to run collective welfare undertakings are great. Workers' family members have participated in social labor, and have also liberated themselves from housework, and their enthusiasm is very high, but they also urgently need help in many ways. Last summer, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company launched a movement in which everyone did a good thing to help women participate in production labor. With the support of enterprise leaders and the masses, more than 200 houses were built, and 15 canteens and 17 nursery stations were set up, liberating a large number of family members from housework and participating in various production activities, and also greatly solving the difficulties of female workers. Their experience proves that: from small to large, from few to many, using a variety of methods, to gradually organize housework into collective welfare undertakings in a planned and systematic way, is much better than doing it in a scattered way. The undertakings that are run must also be better than the original ones, showing their superiority, so that everyone is willing to come. In order to develop production and liberate women's labor force, we advocate that everyone should take responsibility and care about and support every work that is meaningful for women's liberation.

Now, the masses of workers across the country are carrying out labor competitions wave after wave to complete this year's grand plan, and are launching a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy. I fully believe that under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our people will surely continue to achieve a Great Leap Forward and move from victory to victory. The female workers and the vast number of workers' family members across the country must constantly improve their communist spirit, abandon their inferiority complex, set great ambitions, boost their energy, and demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of continuous revolution and overcoming difficulties, and contribute their strength to socialism. Let us, together with all the workers, dedicate our excellent achievements to the tenth anniversary of the National Day and welcome the Conference of Advanced Producers and Advanced Collective Representatives decided by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to be held in the fourth quarter.

　　全国妇女在生产战线上的巨大成就
    杨之华代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    庆幸藏族姊妹走向新生活
    我们全国几百万女职工和九千万职工家属同全国广大人民一样，对于西藏上层反动集团的叛国罪行极为愤慨。全国女职工坚决拥护国务院关于平定西藏叛乱的一切措施，高兴地看到西藏叛乱已被平息，并且庆幸藏族的姐妹和兄弟从此将解脱最残酷、最黑暗的农奴制度的束缚，而早日走向光明自由幸福的新生活。
    西藏历来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是古今中外人所共知的。但是英帝国主义和外国反动派，竟同西藏上层反动集团勾结起来策动叛乱，并公开支持叛乱；印度一些反动报刊摇唇鼓舌、血口喷人地诬蔑我国以为策应，阴谋把西藏从我们的祖国分裂出去，重新置我藏族人民于帝国主义和反动势力的宰割之下。这种阴谋，完全是扩张野心的赤裸裸的暴露，是十分卑鄙狂妄的罪恶行为。
    然而，使人特别惊讶的是，印度官方的一些领袖人物，也曾发表颠倒黑白的言论。印度国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人公然把我国西藏说成是个“国家”；国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人也一再借西藏叛乱事件诽谤我国，荒谬地把西藏叛乱说成是“正义的事业”。印度政府曾再三声明，西藏是中国领土的一部分；印度对西藏决没有领土的和政治的野心。但身为印度官方的女士们，竟发表如此荒谬的言论，能说成是无知吗？除了说她们硬要破坏五项原则，她们在损害着中印两国人民的友谊，还能作出什么判断来呢？她们披着美丽的孔雀羽毛，却发出乌鸦的叫声，使我们不能不怀疑她们存有不良居心。尤其令人无法容忍的是，在我们友邦印度的孟买，在我国驻印领事馆门前，竟有所谓“示威者”，猖狂地污辱我们六亿人民所爱戴的毛主席的像。污辱毛主席就是对六亿中国人民的最大污辱。在印度警察当局纵容下，如此罪恶地活动，难道这能够从印度政府多次的强调中印友好的声明中找到任何解释吗？我要代表全国女职工对这一事件的责任方面表示严正的抗议！我要警告一切帝国主义和外国反动派：西藏永远是中国的西藏，中印两国人民的友谊与和平共处的五项原则不容许你们破坏！中印广大的正义人士，正以雪亮的眼睛看着你们，快把你们那肮脏的手脚缩回去！任何分裂中国领土、离间中印十亿人民团结的阴谋，都必然为人们所唾弃而湮灭，一切具有野心的人，必然是自取灭亡，终于遭到注定的失败。
    妇女运动进到历史新阶段
    现在，我讲一些有关女职工和职工家属参加社会劳动的问题和意见。
    一九五八年以来，在我国社会主义建设事业大跃进的新形势下，妇女运动也跃进到一个新的历史发展阶段。最显著的事实是，与农业战线上广大妇女向自然界大进军的同时，参加到工业战线上的女职工，比一九五七年的女职工总数激增了一倍还多；与城市街道妇女参加社会劳动的同时，工矿企业中的职工家属也普遍大量的办起加工工厂，办起为社会服务的集体事业来。这是一个重大的变化，这个变化对亲身领略过旧社会痛苦的我们来说是何等可喜的现象，妇女们能够如此空前大量地参加到生产建设当中，决不简单。这是党的领导和党的妇女运动政策的伟大胜利，是我国社会主义建设发展的必然结果。毛主席说：“中国妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”这一重要启示，给我们指出了方向，使我们得到无限的鼓舞和力量。社会主义制度本身和社会主义建设的发展，去年的工农业大跃进和人民公社化的实现，为我们妇女参加劳动生产开辟了广阔的道路。广大的妇女本来就有着献身于伟大社会主义事业的迫切要求，经过全民整风运动，又进一步解放了思想，提高了政治思想觉悟。这一切为妇女参加社会劳动创造了极为有利的条件。
    使我们特别感动的是，为了发展生产，为了彻底解放妇女，刘少奇同志在繁忙的工作中，找各级党的领导干部和群众团体的负责人研究组织生产的同时组织生活，他很重视妇女问题，还亲自深入群众，亲切地询问基层的干部和妇女，少奇同志还具体地讲了许多办法，问妇女们能不能办工厂、商店、学校和集体福利事业等。少奇同志的简短的谈话，讲出了妇女们心里的话，照亮了妇女们的心。妇女群众响亮的声音回答了党：我们能行！她们充满了愉快的心情，参加到工矿生产方面和社会服务事业当中。广大妇女们的力量，在党的亲切关怀和伟大感召下，像决了拦的水那样地倾泻出来。
    女职工发挥聪明才智创造了奇迹
    企业中的女职工，发挥出自己的聪明才智，在技术革命运动中不断创造出奇迹。四川西南无线电器材厂的全体女职工，在去年提出技术革新建议二十万件，提前六十四天超额百分之四十五点八七完成了全年跃进计划。像我们在座的代表尉凤英，就试制成功二十多种新产品，并带动全组十六名工人，实现了一百零五项技术改造，为国家创造出四十万元的财富；改进了一种冲模，节省了四个劳动力，提高工效七百倍；在去年就以四个月时间完成了第二个五年计划的任务。她说：“在大跃进中，我的心不能平静，我的血在沸腾”。这反映了多少女职工们的心情！重庆建设机床厂的女工李凤琴，把发电机的一个零件改为机械化制造，提高了工效二十倍。各地涌现出成千上万的先进女工，受到了人们的热烈称赞。她们被称作“钢铁姑娘”、“穆桂英”或“刘胡兰”的先进集体。天桥商店的十三个女店员全是先进工作者。在大跃进中，所有的女职工都以冲天的干劲，和男工们在一起，出色地完成了国家计划。
    职工家属参加社会劳动得到锻炼
    广大的职工家属，参加了社会劳动，也为支援生产建设做出重要的贡献。她们在“不为名来不为利，一心只为社会主义”，“工厂需要什么就干什么”的口号下，群策群力，白手起家，以自己的辛勤劳动兴办了很多卫星工厂、生活服务社。她们拣砖头、起钉子，利用废木料盖起加工工厂、车间、宿舍、食堂，等等，为国家创造了许多财富。
    妇女群众在劳动中受到锻炼，精神方面也发生了极为深刻的变化。一个新参加工作的女工写了一首诗：“共产党领导推翻三座山，妇女身得解放见青天，唯独家务把身缠，弄得心烦琐眉眼。万丈光芒总路线，妇女二次解放欢，吃米不忘种谷人，干劲冲天搞生产。”这完全表达出广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来后，热爱党、热爱社会主义建设的喜悦心情。为了多快好省地建设社会主义，许多女职工精神焕发，斗志昂扬，工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，表现了高度的共产主义觉悟。像广州青年女工向秀丽，为保护国家财产而献出了自己的生命，更是新中国妇女最光辉的形象。
    工业战线上广大妇女们创造出来的巨大成就，和表现的革命干劲，已日益显示出她们在社会主义建设中具有的伟大作用。为了在一九五九年实现更大的跃进，保证完成和争取超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划中的工业生产任务，我们应该巩固和加强这支劳动大军，把她们的积极性和创造性更充分地发挥出来。
    要帮助妇女更好地从事劳动生产
    要使妇女能够巩固地站在生产岗位上积极从事于劳动，需要从各方面给予她们必要的帮助。应当承认，由于历史的和社会的种种原因，有的女工政治觉悟和技术文化水平是比较低的。在女工中，尤其是新女工，还常因家务和孩子的拖累影响到生产和各种业余学习。但是为了生产和社会主义发展的必需，我们还要继续努力培养和扶植这一必不可少的力量。因此，我们要在党的领导下，加强对女职工的思想教育，提高她们的政治觉悟；动员老师傅帮助她们迅速地掌握技术；组织她们努力提高文化水平；特别是要帮助女工解决特殊困难。总之，既要教给她们生产生活方面的知识，又要帮助她们解决具体问题。在生产中，我们要通过竞赛评比，鼓励所有的女工向先进者看齐，把她们提高到先进生产者的水平。尉凤英说的好，“在新的形势下继续跃进，我深感到单是个人琢磨发明创造是有一定限度的，应当把大家发动起来。人多了力量就大。”重庆建设机床厂女职工占三分之一，她们组织了“巧姑娘竞赛”，全厂即涌现出一千一百八十一名“巧姑娘”，在增产节约上为国家创造了很多的财富。这说明了在妇女当中蕴藏着巨大的潜力。只要我们把妇女发动起来，并为她们安心生产创造必要的条件，她们不但可以巩固地参加生产，而且必然会和全体职工在一起作出卓越的成绩。
　　依靠群众办好集体福利事业
    大办集体福利事业，并且要办得好，使家务劳动社会化，经验是，要依靠群众，本着因地制宜、因陋就简、勤俭办事业的方针，首先办好公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园，等等。天津市解放后几年当中，为解决女工困难，虽由国家投资举办了五百四十二个托儿所、幼儿园，收托了小孩二万九千九百零六名，但仍满足不了客观需要。可是去年依靠群众自办，就有了六千二百七十八个，收托小孩十六万一千六百二十一名。这就足以证明依靠群众办集体福利事业的好处很大。职工家属参加了社会劳动，也把自己从家务劳动中解放了出来，积极性是很高的，但也迫切需要多方面给予帮助。石景山钢铁公司在去年夏天发起了一个大家为帮助妇女参加生产劳动做一件好事的运动，在企业领导和群众支持下，盖起二百多间房子，办起了十五个食堂，十七个托儿站，使大批家属从家务劳动中解放出来，参加了各种生产活动，同时也大大地解决了女工的困难。她们的经验证明了：由小到大，由少到多，用多种多样的办法，把家务劳动有计划地、有系统地逐步地组织成为集体福利事业，要比分散的搞好的多。举办的事业，也一定要比原来搞的更好些，显示出它的优越性，才能使大家愿意来。为了发展生产，解放妇女的劳动力，我们提倡每个人都负起责任，关心和支持每一件对妇女解放有意义的工作。
    现在，全国职工群众正在为完成今年的宏伟计划而一浪高过一浪地开展着劳动竞赛，并掀起一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。我完全相信：在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国人民一定能够继续实现大跃进，从胜利走向胜利。全国女职工和广大职工家属，要不断提高自己的共产主义精神，抛弃掉自卑感，立大志，鼓干劲，拿出不断革命和克服困难的战斗精神，为社会主义贡献出自己的力量。让我们和全体工人在一起，以优异的成绩献给国庆十周年，迎接中共中央和国务院决定在第四季度召开的先进生产者和先进集体代表会议。
