Withdraw Your Hands!
Do Not Interfere in China!
Joint Statement by Members of the Literary and Art Circles of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

We come from all over the country, engaged in different work such as literature, fine arts, music, drama, dance, etc., representing different ethnic groups such as Han, Manchu, Mongol, Yi, Korean, Uyghur... This time we have the opportunity to participate in the conference and listen to the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders. We are delighted and encouraged by the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the motherland in 1958, and are fully prepared for an even greater leap forward in 1959. In the past few days, listening to the speeches at the conference, everyone is high-spirited and enthusiastic, fully demonstrating that this is a conference of unity and a conference of leap forward. The beautiful prospects of the motherland's future are so clearly presented before our eyes that, in our excitement, we are glad to be a member of this big family, and each of us is immensely proud and honored to be Chinese today.

Many of us have already spoken at the conference, resolutely expressing our determination to complete the tasks of our generation under the leadership of the Party. However, when we see the ugly farce performed by the imperialist elements and foreign reactionaries regarding the Tibetan event these days, their slander, rumors, and attacks on our great motherland, we are filled with righteous indignation and have decided to speak again.

Tibet has always been Chinese territory. This is universally recognized and has also been repeatedly acknowledged by Prime Minister Nehru. The Tibetan issue is China's internal affair and brooks no interference from any outsiders, just as the Naga issue is India's internal affair and we have never intended to interfere. But today, in India, some people are using the Tibetan event to spread rumors and slanders against our country, stirring up trouble, and attempting to realize their expansionist dreams! Is this tolerable? What exactly is the Tibetan event all about? When our various ethnic groups are already living increasingly happy lives in the big family of the motherland, in a corner of Tibet, under the monopolistic rule of the original Tibetan local government and a handful of upper-class reactionary groups, an extremely dark, backward, reactionary, and cruel serf system is still practiced, with inhuman tortures such as gouging out eyes, cutting off feet, cutting off noses, severing tendons, and removing kneecaps. Officials openly accept bribes, and the army rapes and plunders. A small number of nobles exploit the people through enslavement and usury. The reasonable suggestions of the Central People's Government are often obstructed by a small number of upper-class reactionary groups, and the government's loans and relief are often pocketed by a small number of upper-class reactionary groups. In order to uphold the policy of ethnic unity, the Party and the government have always adopted a tolerant attitude, waiting for the awakening of these upper-class elements. The 1.1 million Tibetan people are living in dire straits. For ten years, they have witnessed the rapid progress and universal improvement of social life in the motherland except for the Tibetan region. In order to get rid of poverty and backwardness, and to change their slave lives, they demand social reform and the path of socialism. Is such a demand unreasonable? Should such a reasonable demand not be supported? However, a small number of upper-class reactionary groups, instigated by imperialism, in order to maintain their vested interests and continue to oppress and exploit the broad masses of the Tibetan people, have actually carried out armed rebellion, openly betraying the motherland. This is intolerable, utterly intolerable! The wheel of history is merciless. Now, this small group of traitors has suffered a shameful defeat! The Chinese People's Liberation Army has not only swiftly quelled the rebellion in the Lhasa area, but also marched south, sweeping away the old nest of the rebel bandits headed by Enzhu Cangkunbu Zhaxi, and will soon be able to completely and cleanly crush the stumbling blocks that hinder the progress of Tibetan society and harm the happiness and prosperity of the Tibetan people. In such a short period of time, in this vast area north of the Himalayas, such a brilliant victory has been achieved, which is inseparable from the Tibetan people's desire for freedom and happiness and their heartfelt assistance. This fact itself demonstrates the 1.1 million Tibetan people's love for the Party and the government, and their enthusiastic support for ethnic and religious policies. Facts speak louder than words. Can the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama," fabricated with lies by a handful of imperialist elements, foreign reactionaries, and Tibetan traitors, withstand the great aspirations of the 1.1 million Tibetan people who love the motherland and strive for progress?

After the rain, the sky is clear. Today, the Tibetan people are gnashing their teeth to denounce the crimes of the upper-class reactionary groups, embracing their relatives, the People's Liberation Army, with tears of gratitude, and singing praises to the wisdom of the Party and the government. They are welcoming the new life of the nation with joyful hearts, drumming and dancing, and singing wildly. Anyone who really has a little sympathy for the Tibetan people cannot help but be moved by this. People will also see that in the near future, the Tibetan Plateau—the roof of the world—will, like any other region of our motherland, become a socialist paradise of happiness, prosperity, and democracy for the Tibetan people.

In fact, it is very simple. This is the essence of the so-called Tibetan event, that is all there is to it. When the people begin to awaken and demand to control their own destiny, there will always be a small number of reactionary forces who, in order to maintain their vested interests, rise up to obstruct them. Such things have been repeated countless times in modern history. But the final fate always ends in failure. This is the law of history. Now, for us, the Tibetan event has basically been resolved, and a small gust of wind has passed.

It is regrettable that in India, in the neighboring country of India, which has a long history of cultural relations and traditional friendship with us, some people are continuing to stir up trouble under the pretext of the Tibetan issue, and it seems to be getting "stronger" and stronger. The insulting Chinese idioms that imperialists shouted decades ago, years ago, and even now are being uttered verbatim by some Indians and published in some Indian newspapers. In Kalimpong, in Mussoorie, and even in New Delhi, conspiracies are being carried out openly. A current Indian diplomatic official is actually distributing English translations of the lying so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" with his own hands; some members of parliament are openly interfering in China's internal affairs, proposing the so-called "Tibetan independence" that the Dalai Lama himself has never said and still does not agree to; some Indian expansionists are even openly insulting portraits of our leaders with the tacit consent of the police. Who gives them the right to slander neighboring countries? Who entrusts them with the authority to plan so-called "independence" for the territory of neighboring countries? Does all this conform to the traditional spirit of India? No! The teachings of Mahatma Gandhi are being undermined by some people. Some Indian expansionists have inherited the mantle of imperialism and are ruining India; other Indian politicians who are following behind the expansionists are now also showing muddled minds and confused thinking, chanting Sino-Indian friendship on the one hand, while secretly reaching out their hands to rummage through their friend's pockets. There is an old Chinese saying, "Greed makes one lose one's mind." Is that perhaps the case?

Of course, we know that the vast majority of the Indian people will spurn this evil behavior. We have already seen fair public opinion in India condemn these evils. Justice will prevail! We deeply respect the traditional spirit of India. China and India have suffered from imperialist aggression in the past. In the past ten years, our friendship has made great progress. Many Indian friends have visited China, and some of us have also visited India, and have had profound cultural and emotional exchanges. We are as happy about any progress in India as we are about our own progress. We are very clear that it is the imperialist schemers and a small group of Indian expansionists who are undermining Sino-Indian friendship today. We must shout loudly to these people:

Withdraw your hands! Do not interfere in China!
Tibet is Chinese territory! The Chinese people and the Chinese government have enough power to handle their own problems!
The era when imperialists and foreign reactionaries manipulated China's internal affairs is long gone. China with 600 million people cannot be insulted!

### 缩回你们的手去！不要干涉中国！中国人民政治协商会议文学艺术界委员的联合发言

    缩回你们的手去！
    不要干涉中国！
    中国人民政治协商会议文学艺术界委员的联合发言
    我们来自全国各地，从事文学、美术、音乐、戏剧、舞蹈等不同的工作，代表了汉、满、蒙、彝、朝、维吾尔……等不同的民族，这次有机会参加大会，听了周总理和各位首长的报告，我们为一九五八年祖国各方面史无前例的大跃进而欢欣鼓舞，为一九五九年更大的跃进准备了充沛的干劲，几天来，听大会发言，一个个意气风发，热情洋溢，充分地证明这是个团结的大会，跃进的大会。祖国未来的美景如此鲜明地呈现在我们的眼前，兴奋之余，我们庆幸自己是这个大家庭里的一员，我们每个人都以自己能够是今天的中国人而感到无比的骄傲和自豪。
    我们中间许多人已经在大会上发了言，坚决地表示要在党的领导下完成我们这一代的任务，可是，当我们看到这几天帝国主义分子和外国反动派就西藏事件所表演的丑剧，对我们伟大祖国的诬蔑、造谣和中伤，激于义愤，我们决定再一次发言。
    西藏从来就是中国的领土，这是举世公认，也是尼赫鲁总理所一再承认的。西藏问题是中国的内政问题，不容任何外人干涉，正如那加族问题是印度的内政问题，我们从来不想加以干涉一样。可是今天在印度竟然有人利用西藏事件对我国造谣诬蔑，兴风作浪，企图借此实现其扩张的迷梦！这难道是能够容忍的吗？西藏事件究竟是怎么回事呢？当我们各民族在祖国的大家庭里已经过着日益幸福的生活的时候，在西藏一角，在原西藏地方政府和少数上层反动集团的包办统治下，还实行着极端黑暗、落后、反动、残酷的农奴制度，还实行着挖眼、刖足、割鼻、断脚筋、去膝盖骨等等非人的刑罚，官员贿赂公行，军队奸淫掳掠，一小撮贵族用奴役和高利贷来剥削人民。中央人民政府合理的建议，往往为少数上层反动集团所阻挠，政府的发放贷款和救济，往往为少数上层反动集团所中饱，党和政府为了维护民族团结政策，始终以容忍的态度，等待这些上层分子的觉悟，藏族一百一十几万人民处在水深火热的生活中，十年以来，目睹祖国除了西藏地区以外一日千里的进步，社会生活的普遍改善，为了摆脱贫穷和落后，为了改变奴隶生活，要求实行社会改革，走社会主义的道路，难道这样的要求是不合理的吗？难道这样合理的要求是不应该支持的吗？然而一小撮上层反动集团在帝国主义唆使下，为要维持其既得权利，继续压迫和剥削广大的藏族人民，竟实行武装叛乱，公然背叛祖国，是可忍，孰不可忍！历史的车轮是决不容情的，现在，这一小撮卖国贼已经遭到了可耻的失败！中国人民解放军不仅迅速地平定了拉萨地区的叛乱，而且挥师南下，扫荡了以恩珠仓·公布扎西为首的叛匪的老巢，不日就可以肃清山南地区，彻底干净地粉碎阻碍西藏社会前进、妨害藏族人民幸福繁荣的绊脚石。在这样短短的时间内，在喜马拉雅山以北这个广大的地区里，取得如此辉煌的胜利，这是与藏族人民渴望自由幸福的愿望和由衷的协助分不开的，这一事实本身，说明了一百一十几万藏族人民对党和政府的爱戴，对民族政策和宗教政策的热情拥护。事实是最雄辩的。由一小撮帝国主义分子、外国反动派和西藏叛国分子捏造出来、谎话连篇的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，难道抵得住一百一十几万藏族人民热爱祖国、力求进步的伟大的愿望吗？
    雨过天晴，今天，西藏人民正在咬牙切齿地控诉上层反动集团的罪行，热泪纵横地拥抱自己的亲人人民解放军，千恩万谢地歌颂党和政府的英明，他们以敲锣打鼓、狂歌曼舞的舒畅心情迎接着民族的新生。任何人对西藏人民真的还有一点点同情心的话，就不得不为此而感动。人们还会看到：不久的将来，在西藏高原——这个世界的屋脊上，将和我们祖国任何地区一样，成为藏族人民幸福、繁荣、民主的社会主义的乐园。
    说起来真是简单得很，这就是所谓西藏事件的实质，就是那么一回事。当人民开始觉醒，要求掌握自己命运的时候，总有一小撮反动势力为了维护其既得利益，起来阻挠，这样的事情在近代历史上不知已经重复过多少次了。而最后的命运却终归于失败，这是历史的规律。现在，对我们来说，西藏事件基本上已经解决了，一阵小小的歪风已经刮过去了。
    令人惋惜的是：在印度，在和我们有着悠久的文化关系与传统友谊的邻邦印度，有人却借口西藏问题继续在刮着歪风，而且看来是越刮越“有劲”了。帝国主义在几十年前、几年前、乃至现在还在叫嚣着的侮辱中国的习语，原封不动地出诸某些印度人之口，登上某些印度的报纸。在噶伦堡，在穆索里，甚至也在新德里，阴谋正在公开进行。一个印度的现任外交官员，竟然亲手散发谎话连篇的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的英译本；一些议员竟然公开干涉中国内政，提出达赖本人从来没有说过、至今也还不同意说的所谓“西藏独立”；一些印度扩张主义分子竟然在警察的默许下，公开侮辱我国领袖的画像。谁赋予他们这种污蔑邻邦的权利？谁委托他们越俎代庖地对邻国的领土策划所谓“独立”？难道这一切符合于印度的传统精神吗？不！圣雄甘地的遗教正在被有些人破坏着，一些印度扩张主义分子继承了帝国主义的衣钵，正在糟蹋印度；另一些跟在扩张主义分子屁股后面的印度政治家，现在也表现了头脑昏沉，思想混乱，一面叫着中印友好，一面却偷偷地伸出手来，掏摸着朋友的口袋。中国有句老话，叫做“利令智昏”。莫非事实就是这样吗？
    当然，我们知道绝大多数印度人民是会唾弃这种罪恶行为的，我们已经看到印度的公正舆论已经对这些罪恶提出谴责，正义必将伸张！我们非常尊重印度的传统精神，中印两国在过去年代里饱受过帝国主义的侵略，十年以来，我们的友谊有了很大的进展，许多印度朋友到过中国，我们中间，也有好些人到过印度，在文化上、在感情上有过深刻的交流。印度的任何一点进步，都像我们自己的进步一样使我们高兴。我们非常清楚：今天在破坏中印友谊的是帝国主义野心家，是一小撮印度的扩张主义分子，我们必须向这些人猛喝一声：
    缩回你们的手去！不要干涉中国！
    西藏是中国的领土！中国人民和中国政府有足够力量来处理自己的问题！
    帝国主义和外国反动派摆布中国内政的时代早已过去了，六亿人民的中国是不容轻侮的！
