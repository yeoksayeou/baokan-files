　　Mao Zedong told us: "The responsibility of a leader, in summary, mainly involves two things: generating ideas and using cadres." He also said: "All plans, resolutions, orders, instructions, and so on, belong to the category of 'generating ideas'." Generating ideas can be done with varying degrees of skill; there is a difference between being less resourceful and arbitrary, and being decisive and resourceful. Whether our Party's policies and plans are correct is related to the interests of hundreds of millions of people and the success or failure of our cause. Therefore, every cadre must constantly pay attention to improving their work methods, striving to be decisive and resourceful, and generating good ideas. How to achieve this is a topic we must constantly study.

　　Mao Zedong told us: "Determining the work direction according to the actual situation is the most basic working method that all communists must firmly remember." This is also the basic method for us to be decisive and resourceful. No matter who it is, if they do not understand that correct policies and plans can only be an objective reflection of actual things, and insist on acting according to their own subjective wishes, even if they have very good intentions, but do not pay attention to systematically conducting investigation and research, understanding the situation, and are unwilling to patiently consult with the masses in all aspects, but only rely on their own flash of inspiration and impulsive decision to make judgments and decide on problems, they will inevitably go against their wishes, run into obstacles everywhere in their work, and make various mistakes. It should be said that after the great rectification movement of the whole people and the whole Party, the subjective work style among cadres has been greatly reduced, and the atmosphere of investigation and research has been further enhanced. This is the basic aspect and mainstream of our cadres' work style. This is obvious to all. However, we must also see that there are also a few comrades who think that they can definitely achieve whatever they think of, and no longer pay attention to conducting investigation and research at any time and place, and are unwilling to humbly consider the opinions of the masses, often deciding on major issues only based on the one-sided materials they know or their subjective wishes. This work method of being less resourceful and arbitrary or not resourceful and acting recklessly is extremely harmful. It will seriously damage the interests of the people and cause setbacks to the cause of revolution and construction. Being less resourceful and arbitrary or not resourceful and acting recklessly is essentially a product of the subjective idealism, characterized by the separation of the subjective from the objective, which prevents us from comprehensively and correctly understanding objective things. To do a good job and generate good ideas, we must strive to avoid and overcome this shortcoming.

　　To be decisive and resourceful and correctly decide on problems, we must first, as Mao Zedong said, start from the objective realities existing at home and abroad, inside and outside the province, inside and outside the county, thoroughly occupy materials, conduct scientific analysis and comprehensive research, and derive from them inherent rather than fabricated laws as our guide to action. Investigation and research, and scientific analysis, are the basis of sound judgment. Only judgments made on the basis of systematic investigation and research can withstand the test of practice and be feasible. Therefore, in our work, we must consciously conduct systematic investigation and research on the current situation, the current trend, the laws of development of various movements, the contradictory struggle situation, and the constantly changing political and ideological situation and living conditions of the masses, and so on. The process of concept formation, the process of judgment formation, and the process of reasoning are all processes of investigation and research. People are capable of understanding the objective world, but to understand objective things more correctly and comprehensively, they must undergo repeated investigation and continuous research so that their subjective understanding, that is, our thoughts, opinions, work plans, etc., are roughly in line with the objective reality and are more correct and reasonable. To be decisive and resourceful and correctly decide on problems, we must always keep in mind Chairman Mao's words: "Studying the overall situation and its development of this movement is a major subject that we must always pay attention to. If anyone refuses to conduct serious and meticulous research on these, then he is not a Marxist." Objective things are constantly developing and changing, and our subjective understanding often only approximately reflects objective things. Therefore, we must constantly conduct investigation and research to test whether our original thoughts, plans, and measures are correct, and to discover new trends and new trends in the development of the movement in a timely manner, so as to make new judgments and take new measures; we must never be ideologically rigid and think that we can be worry-free after one or several investigations and researches.

　　Opportunities are not to be missed, and time never returns. Being decisive and resourceful and correctly deciding on problems is not only reflected in the correctness of thoughts and decisions, but also in being good at discovering the sprouts of new things that have just emerged on the horizon, seizing the opportunity, and guiding the movement in a timely manner. Here, timeliness and correctness are unified. Giving advice after the event, like Zhuge Liang after the fact, even if it is correct, will also miss the opportunity. To constantly seize opportunities, we need to frequently go deep into the workers, peasants, and activists, talk with them, discuss problems, and explore the key, direction, and future of the current movement from the practice of the masses, from typical investigations, and from the budding state of things, make scientifically predictive judgments, and make decisive decisions so that we can always stand at the forefront of the movement and guide the masses forward.

　　Since correct thoughts and plans can only be a more comprehensive reflection of objective things, then its raw materials can only come from the rich production and revolutionary struggles of the broad masses, and our minds can only play the role of processing and analyzing. This is the epistemological view of dialectical materialism. Therefore, to be decisive and resourceful, we must be good at widely concentrating the experience and wisdom of the masses. The process of investigation and research, the process of collecting materials and analyzing and researching them, is also the process of repeatedly concentrating the opinions of the masses. Investigation and research means seeking more advice, discussing more, and consulting more with the masses. Without the investigation and research of the experience and opinions of the masses, no genius can make correct judgments. Therefore, to be decisive, we must seek advice from the masses. For the decision of all major issues, there must be sufficient discussion in the appropriate collective, widely concentrate the opinions of the masses, pay special attention to listening to and considering various different opinions, be good at inspiring and guiding different opinions to be expressed, and allow various different viewpoints to be debated freely, in order to more comprehensively reflect the various opinions of the masses inside and outside the Party, that is, to more comprehensively reflect the various aspects of the development process of objective things. Only judgments made on this basis can make more complete and comprehensive decisions on some major issues, and avoid or reduce errors.

　　Various different and even opposing opinions are different reflections of the inherent contradictions of objective things in people's minds, and their existence is very natural. To seek more advice from the masses, we must be good at listening to different opinions, especially patiently listening to and calmly considering opposing opinions. The reason why this is necessary is, first of all, that all correct thoughts, opinions, and plans are always developed and improved in the process of struggling with wrong thoughts, opinions, and plans, which is the dialectics of the development of objective things. The objective situation is that even correct theories, thoughts, and opinions are often not very perfect when they are first formed. On the one hand, they need to be tested in practice to see if they are correct, and on the other hand, they need to be supplemented, revised, and developed. Being good at listening to different and even completely opposing opinions is consciously using dialectics, using the struggle of opposites, to examine and develop one's own thoughts, opinions, and plans, and to systematize and rationalize correct thoughts, opinions, and plans. Secondly, opinions that are opposed to one's own thoughts are not necessarily all wrong, and even if most of them are wrong, they may still contain some beneficial and reasonable parts. Being good at listening to different and even opposing opinions can also accept reasonable opposing opinions or the reasonable parts of opposing opinions, so that correct opinions can be supplemented and become more comprehensive. Finally, in most cases, the truth is always on the side of the majority, but sometimes the opinions of the majority may be incorrect, while those who hold opposing opinions may have grasped the truth. In the history of the CPSU, Lenin had such an experience. During the period when the dogmatic line ruled, Mao Zedong's correct line was also in a minority position, which is familiar to everyone. Therefore, it is very necessary to pay attention to the different opinions of a few people. As the saying goes, "Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened; listen to only one side and you will be benighted." Seeking more advice from the masses, and humbly considering various different opinions, having a comparison, having a choice, can better comprehensively reflect the various aspects of things, which is the basic condition for being decisive. Of course, to achieve this, we need to treat the masses with a humble attitude and the posture of ordinary laborers, take the initiative to talk with the masses cordially, and discuss problems and exchange opinions freely. We must listen patiently to the different opinions raised by others and consider them, and never retort as soon as we hear opinions that are different from our own. Being arrogant, arbitrary, only loving to listen to words that suit one's taste, unwilling to listen to words that do not suit one's taste, not consulting with the masses, or deciding on the selection of materials based on one's own subjective wishes and preferences, especially welcoming materials that are beneficial to the conclusions in one's mind, and refusing to consider or even obliterating materials that are unfavorable, are themselves violations of the mass line. "Principles are only correct when they are suitable for nature and history. This is the only materialistic view of things." (Engels) Forcing objective materials and other people's opinions to fit the framework in one's own mind, even at the cost of cutting one's feet to fit the shoes, is a completely idealistic way of thinking and working. It is impossible to help oneself make any correct judgments.

　　In real life, there are often such situations: some comrades live with the masses all day long, and they know very well which side of the room Zhang San's kang is on, and what kind of temper Li Si has. They have also gathered a lot of investigative materials, but they can't grasp the fundamental key of the current movement, they can't grasp it correctly, and they even come up with some wrong ideas. This shows that to be decisive and resourceful, it is also necessary to be good at using the Marxist method to analyze, criticize, and summarize various materials, reflections, and opinions in the process of concentrating the opinions of the masses and conducting investigation and research, to discard the dross and select the essence, eliminate the false and retain the true, and grasp the essence of things through the complicated phenomena. Only in this way can we truly form scientific foresight and use it to guide our actions. If we only list the materials and opinions as phenomena without analysis, or if the method of analysis is not correct, we cannot be decisive. Therefore, we must constantly study Marxism-Leninism, study the Party's policies and guidelines, especially study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, draw strength from Comrade Mao Zedong's model of leading the Chinese revolution and construction, and improve our theoretical level and analytical ability.

　　多谋善断
　　侯铁萍
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“领导者的责任，归结起来，主要地是出主意、用干部两件事”。他又说：“一切计划、决议、命令、指示等等，都属于‘出主意’之类”。出主意也有比较会出和不会出的，有少谋武断或多谋善断之分。我们党的方针政策、计划的是否正确，关系着亿万人民的利益，关系着我们事业的成败。因此，每个干部必须经常地注意改进自己的工作方法，力求做到多谋善断，出好主意。如何做到这一点，是我们必须经常研究的课题。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。”这也是我们做到多谋善断的基本方法。不管任何人，如果不懂得正确的方针政策、计划只能是对实际事物的客观反映，而坚持按照自己的主观愿望办事，即使自己有非常善良的愿望，但在行动中不注意系统地进行调查研究、了解情况，不肯耐心地同各方面群众商量，仅凭自己灵机一动，脑子一热，就做出判断，决定问题，也必然是事与愿违，在工作中到处碰钉子，犯这样或那样的错误。应该说，经过全民全党的伟大整风运动，干部中间的主观主义作风大大减少了，调查研究的空气进一步浓厚了，这是我们干部作风的基本方面和主流。这是有目共睹的。但是，我们还必须看到，也有少数同志以为自己想到哪里就一定能够做到哪里，不再注意随时随地进行调查研究，不肯虚心地考虑群众的意见，往往只凭自己知道的片面材料或主观愿望，决定重大问题。这种少谋武断或不谋乱断的工作方法，其危害性是十分明显的。它会使人民群众的利益受到严重的损害，会使革命和建设事业遭到挫折。少谋武断或不谋乱断，本质上是主观主义思想方法的产物，以主观同客观分离为特征，它妨碍我们全面地正确地认识客观事物。要想做好工作，出好主意，必须力求避免和克服这种毛病。
    要多谋善断，正确地决定问题，首先必须像毛泽东同志说的，从国内外、省内外、县内外客观存在的实际事物出发，详细地占有材料，加以科学的分析和综合研究，从其中引出固有的而不是臆造的规律，作为我们行动的向导。调查研究，科学分析，是善断的基础。也只有在系统地调查研究的基础上做出的判断，才可能经得起实践的检验，才能行得通。因此，我们在工作中，必须自觉地对于当前情况，当前的大势，对于各种运动发展的规律，对于充满矛盾的斗争形势，对于不断变化的群众政治思想状况、生活状况，等等，进行系统的调查研究。概念形成的过程，判断形成的过程，推理的过程，就是调查研究的过程。人是能够认识客观世界的，但是要比较正确地全面地认识客观事物，必须经过反复的考察、不断的研究，才可能使自己的主观认识，也就是我们的思想、意见、工作计划等，大体上符合客观实际情况，搞得比较正确，比较合理。要多谋善断，正确决定问题，必须时刻谨记着毛主席的话：“研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们时刻要注意的大课题。如果有人拒绝对于这些作认真过细的研究，那他就不是马克思主义者”。客观事物是不断发展变化的，我们的主观认识又往往只能是近似地反映客观事物，因此，我们必须经常地进行调查研究，以检验我们原来的思想、计划、措施是否正确，及时发现新的动态，发现运动发展的新趋势，以做出新的判断，采取新的措施；决不能思想僵化，认为经一次或几次调查研究就可以万事大吉，再不操心了。
    机不可失，时不再来。多谋善断，正确地决定问题，不仅仅表现在思想、决策的正确性，还表现在善于及时发现在地平线上刚刚露头的新事物的萌芽，抓住时机，及时指导运动。这里时效性和正确性是统一的。放马后炮，事后诸葛亮，即使正确，也会坐失良机。要经常抓住时机，就要求我们经常地深入到工人、农民、积极分子中，同他们谈心，商量问题，从群众实践中，从典型调查中，从事物的萌芽状态中，探索出当前运动的关键、方向和前途，做出有科学预见的判断，做到当机立断，才能永远站在运动的最前列，引导群众前进。
    既然正确的思想、计划只能是对客观事物比较全面的反映，那么它的原料，只能来于广大群众丰富的生产和革命斗争的实践，我们的头脑只能起加工分析的作用，这是辩证唯物主义的认识论。因此，要多谋善断，就必须善于广泛地集中群众的经验和智慧。所谓调查研究的过程，搜集材料、加以分析研究的过程，也就是反复集中群众意见的过程。调查研究，就是向群众多谋，多商量，多请教。离开群众的经验和意见的调查研究，任何天才也不可能做出正确的判断。因此，要善断，就必须同群众多谋。对于一切重大问题的决定，必须在适当的集体中经过充分的讨论，广泛地集中群众意见，特别注意听取和考虑各种不同的意见，善于启发和诱导不同的意见发表出来，并且容许各种不同的观点无拘束的争论，以便比较全面地反映党内外群众的各种意见，也就是比较全面地反映客观事物发展过程中的各个侧面。只有在这样的基础上做的判断，才可能对于一些重大问题做出比较完善和比较全面的决定，避免或减少错误。
    各种不同的甚至相互对立的意见，是客观事物内在矛盾在人们头脑中的不同的反映，它们的存在是很自然的。要多谋于群众，就必须善于听取不同的意见，特别是耐心地听取和从容地考虑反面意见。其所以必须这样，首先，是一切正确的思想意见和计划总是在同错误的思想、意见和计划作斗争的过程中获得发展和完善的，这是客观事物发展的辩证法。客观的情况是，即使是正确的理论、思想和意见，在刚刚形成的时候，也往往是不十分完善的，它一方面需要在实践中检验是否正确，同时也需要补充、修正和发展。善于听取不同的甚至完全对立的意见，正是自觉地运用辩证法，利用对立面的斗争，来检查和发展自己的思想、意见和计划，使正确的思想、意见和计划系统化和条理化。其次，和自己的思想对立的意见，不一定都是错误的意见，即或是其中大部分是错误，也还可能包含着若干有益的合理的部分。善于听取不同的甚至反面的意见，还可以接受合理的反对意见或者反对意见中的合理部分，以使正确的意见获得补充而更加全面。最后，在多数情况下，真理总是在多数人一边的，但是，多数人的意见有时也会是不正确的，而持反对意见的人反而掌握了真理。在苏共党史上，列宁就有过这样的经历。在教条主义路线统治时期，毛泽东同志的正确路线也曾经处于少数的地位，这是大家熟悉的。因此，重视少数人的不同意见，是十分必要的。古语说的好，“兼听则明，偏听则暗。”多谋于群众，虚心地考虑各种不同的意见，有个比较，有个选择，才能更好地全面反映事物的各个侧面，这是善断的基本条件。当然要做到这一点，就需要我们以谦虚的态度，以普通劳动者的姿态对待群众，主动地找群众倾心接谈，无拘束地商量问题，交换意见。对于别人提出的不同意见要耐心听，并且加以考虑，决不能一听到和自己不同的意见就顶回去。骄傲，武断，只爱听合自己口味的话，不愿听不合自己口味的话，不同群众商量，或者凭自己的主观愿望和好恶决定材料的取舍，对自己脑子里的结论有利的材料就特别欢迎，不利的就拒绝考虑甚至加以抹杀，这些本身就是违反群众路线的。“原则只有在其适合自然界和历史之时，才是正确的。这是对于事物的唯一的唯物主义观点。”（恩格斯）硬要客观材料、别人的意见适合自己脑子里的框子，甚至不惜削足适屦，这完全是唯心主义的思想方法和作风。决不可能帮助自己做出什么正确的判断。
    在实际生活中，也常常有这样的情况，有些同志整天和群众生活在一起，对张三的炕在屋哪边，李四有什么脾性，都摸得很清楚，调查材料也搞得不少，但是对当前运动中的根本关键总是摸不准，抓不对，甚至出一些错主意。这就说明，要多谋善断，还需要在集中群众意见，进行调查研究的过程中，善于把各种材料、反映和意见，用马克思主义的方法，加以分析、批判和概括，去粗取精，去伪存真，透过纷繁的现象抓住事物的本质。这样才能真正形成科学的预见，用来指导自己的行动。对材料、意见，只是现象罗列，不加分析，或分析的方法不对头，也不可能善断。因此，就必须经常学习马克思列宁主义，学习党的方针政策，特别是学习毛泽东同志的著作，从毛泽东同志领导中国革命和建设的典范中，吸取力量，提高理论水平和分析能力。
