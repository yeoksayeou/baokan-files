Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 29th. A large-scale and enthusiastic mass rally for the "Sino-Indian Friendship Day" was held in Calcutta, India's largest industrial city, on the evening of the 28th.

The rally was jointly organized by the Communist Party of India, the United Socialist Organization of India, and the Marxist Forward Bloc, and was enthusiastically supported by many trade union organizations and people from all walks of life.

Before sunset, columns of workers, employees, and students, holding aloft red banners and slogans, poured into the venue from all parts of the city. These slogans expressed opposition to interference in the Tibetan issue, which is China's internal affair. Other slogans read: Defeat the conspiracy of the enemies of Sino-Indian friendship, Down with the US-Pakistan military treaty, Long live Afro-Asian solidarity, etc.

In Calcutta, there are currently two completely opposing currents—one is a strong desire to strengthen Sino-Indian friendship, and the other is a frenzy of anti-China movements on the Tibetan issue. Some proponents of anti-China movements in India will hold a "All-India Tibet Conference" in Calcutta on May 30, attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs.

At the "Sino-Indian Friendship Day" mass rally, Communist leader Hiren Mukerjee said that the purpose of the anti-China movement is to strengthen the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the US-Pakistan military treaty. The purpose of the US-Pakistan military treaty is to undermine India's freedom. This conspiracy is designed to force India to change its foreign policy in favor of the imperialists.

Mukerjee asked, why have the leaders of the Praja Socialist Party never condemned the US-Pakistan military treaty?

Professor Das Gupta, leader of the United Socialist Organization of India, said that after the revolution, China advanced together with all nationalities, and Tibet was one of these nationalities. He also said that nationalities only prospered under the socialist system. He strongly refuted the notion that Tibet was a "separate country" and the so-called "national uprising" in Tibet.

Also speaking were Bhupesh Gupta, secretary of the National Council Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, who came specifically from Madras to attend the meeting, Amar Bose, leader of the Marxist Forward Bloc, and Dr. Ranan Sen, a well-known trade union leader who served as chairman of the meeting.

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution amid warm applause. The resolution stated, "Imperialist countries have never relaxed their activities endangering the freedom and security of India and other Asian and African countries. Only the united movement of Asian and African countries can defeat the conspiracy of imperialism. The main axis of Asian and African unity is the friendship between India and China."

The resolution pointed out, "Some people are trying to use the recent events in Tibet as a means to alienate India and China. At a time when the US-Pakistan bilateral agreement is threatening India's flank, any attempt to create tension between India and China will only benefit imperialism."

The meeting pointed out, "In fact, parties like the Praja Socialist Party, the Hindu Mahasabha, and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which are leading the anti-China movement, are serving the interests of imperialism. We urge the people to oppose this movement for the sake of our own national interests."

The meeting called on the Indian government to "stand firm on the basis of Sino-Indian friendship and stop all acts of interference in China's internal affairs."

Prior to this rally, the people of Calcutta responded to the Communist Party of India's resolution on strengthening Sino-Indian friendship by holding marches and street rallies.

On May 27, tens of thousands of people in Calcutta participated in more than fifty street rallies convened by the Communist Party and the Marxist Forward Bloc in various parts of the city, demanding the maintenance of Sino-Indian friendship and preparing for the "Sino-Indian Friendship Day" on May 28. The participants were full of enthusiasm. The meeting lasted until late at night.

Activists from the Communist Party, the Marxist Forward Bloc, and the United Socialist Organization of India plastered the city with slogans. At these street rallies, a large number of pamphlets on the Tibetan issue were sold.

These enthusiastic activities of the people of Calcutta constituted a strong prelude to the "Sino-Indian Friendship Day" held on the 28th.

    规模浩大  热情洋溢
    加尔各答举行印中友好群众大会
    决议强调印中友谊是亚洲国家团结的主要因素
    新华社新德里29日电　规模浩大、热情洋溢的“印中友好日”群众大会28日晚上在印度最大的工业城市加尔各答举行。
    这个大会是由印度共产党、印度统一社会主义组织和马克思主义者前进同盟联合举办的，许多工会组织和各界人民都热烈支持这个群众大会。
    在日落以前，工人、职员和学生的队伍高举着红色横幅标语，从城市各处涌向会场。这些标语表示反对干涉属于中国内政的西藏问题。还有些标语写着：击败印中友谊的敌人的阴谋，打倒美巴军事条约，亚非团结万岁等。
    在加尔各答，现在正激荡着两股完全相反的潮流——一股是要加强印中友谊的强烈愿望的潮流，另一股是在西藏问题上进行疯狂的反对中国运动的潮流。印度的一些反华运动的倡导者们将在5月30日在加尔各答举行企图干涉中国内政的“全印西藏会议”。
    在“印中友好日”群众大会上共产党领袖希伦·慕克吉说，反对中国的运动的目的是要加强东南亚条约组织和美巴军事条约。美巴军事条约的目的就是要破坏印度的自由。这个阴谋是想迫使印度把它的外交政策作有利于帝国主义者的改变。
    慕克吉问道，人民社会党的领袖们为什么从来不谴责美巴军事条约呢？
    印度统一社会主义组织领袖达斯·古普塔教授说，中国在革命以后同各民族一起前进，西藏就是这些民族之一。他又说，各民族只是在社会主义制度之下才得到了繁荣。他强烈地驳斥了所谓西藏是一个“单独的国家”和所谓西藏“民族起义”的说法。
    发言的还有，特地从马德拉斯赶来参加大会的印度共产党全国委员会书记处书记布佩希·古普塔、马克思主义者前进同盟领袖阿马尔·鲍斯和担任大会主席的知名工会领袖拉南·森博士。
    大会在热烈的掌声中一致通过了一项决议。决议说，“帝国主义国家从来就没有放松它们危害印度的自由和安全以及其它亚非国家的活动，只有亚非国家团结一致的运动才能击败帝国主义的阴谋，亚非国家团结的主要轴心就是印度和中国的友谊。”
  决议指出，“有人正在力图利用西藏最近发生的事件作为离间印度和中国的手段。在美巴双边协定正在威胁印度的侧翼的时候，任何制造印度和中国之间的紧张局势的努力只会有利于帝国主义。”
    大会指出，“事实上像人民社会党、印度人民同盟和印度教大会这些领导反华运动的政党正在为帝国主义的利益服务。我们吁请人民为了我们自己的国家利益反对这一运动。”
    大会呼吁印度政府“在印中友好的基础上站稳立场，制止一切干涉中国内政的行为”。
    这次大会以前，加尔各答人民就响应印度共产党关于加强印中友谊的决议，纷纷举行游行和街头集会。
    5月27日，成千上万的加尔各答人在城内各个地区参加了共产党和马克思主义者前进同盟所召开的五十多个街头大会，要求维护印中友好，并且为在5月28日举行的“印中友好日”作准备。与会者热情洋溢。大会一直开到深夜。
    共产党、马克思主义者前进同盟和印度统一社会主义组织的积极分子在全城贴满了标语。在这些街头大会上，出售了大批论西藏问题的小册子。
    加尔各答人民这些热情的活动构成了28日举行的“印中友好日”的强有力的前奏。
