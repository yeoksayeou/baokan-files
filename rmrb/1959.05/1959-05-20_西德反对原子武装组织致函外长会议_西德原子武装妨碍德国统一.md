Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 18th: According to TASS, the Presidium of the "Permanent Assembly of All People in the Federal Republic of Germany Against Atomic Armament" sent a letter to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the two Germanys participating in the Geneva Conference, strongly protesting West Germany's atomic armament.

The letter stated that equipping the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons and stationing foreign troops equipped with nuclear weapons on West German territory poses a fatal threat to the survival of the German people. The letter said that the German people long for the two Germanys to improve their mutual relations through negotiations and to discuss preliminary steps for reunification, while West Germany's atomic armament is an obstacle to this.

The letter calls on West German citizens to take joint action to fight against West German atomic armament and strive for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, thereby contributing to "the success of the Geneva Conference and the success of negotiations on a German peace treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 17th: According to TASS, the West German "Association of German Scientists for the Freedom of Research" sent an appeal to the participants of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, hoping that the conference participants would achieve beneficial results in the negotiations on a German peace treaty and the settlement of the West Berlin issue.

The appeal pointed out that "the Federal Republic of Germany's involvement in the atomic arms race has drastically worsened the international situation and greatly increased the risk of atomic war." (Attached picture)
