Title: Six-Character Verse in Praise of the Beijing Conference

    Beijing conference opens,
    Political Consultative Conference restarts.
    Economic construction like brocade,
    United leap forward, grand indeed!
    The general line of more, faster, better, and more economical results,
    Simultaneous development, multiple output.
    Promote science, technology, literature and philosophy,
    The future is broad and boundless.
    This year's tasks are arduous,
    Last year's foundation is very strong.
    Still need to work hard and fight again,
    Enter the room and ascend the hall [idiom for reaching a higher level of achievement].
    A hundred rivers surely flow to the sea,
    The path is winding and circuitous.
    How can there be perfection,
    Completely without any tailoring?
    Some people pay attention to quality,
    This is generally correct.
    If it turns into nitpicking,
    What is your quality like?
    Look at the rebels taking up arms,
    Destroying the unity of the motherland.
    Six hundred million people roar in anger,
    Opposing foreign interference.
    I have a word of advice,
    Don't sever your own path of return.
    The Central government has always been lenient,
    The Buddha said, repentance is salvation.
    Wheat harvest is approaching in the north,
    Summer planting is in full swing in the south.
    Construction is like the Long March,
    Treading through distant waters and high mountains.
    China has been weak for a hundred years,
    Now it has turned over in ten years.
    Having experienced wind, frost, rain, and snow,
    The foundation is laid as solid as a rock.
    The elderly are hale and hearty,
    The youth speak out with vigor.
    Everyone is full of enthusiasm,
    Everyone follows the leadership.

    Eve of May Day, 1959

    北京会议六言颂
    陈设人民会议启幕，政治协商三开。经济建设如锦，团结跃进大哉。路线多快好省，生产并举加番。推动科技文哲，前途广阔无边。今年任务固重，去岁基础很强。还须努力再战，入室通过升堂。百川东必至海，道途曲折迂回。那有天衣无缝，完全不费剪裁。有人注意质量，这有一般正确。如果变为挑剔，你的质量如何？你看叛逆称兵，破坏祖国团结。六亿人民怒吼，反对外来干涉。我有一言奉劝，归路不要自断。中央历来宽大，佛说回头是岸。北地麦收将至，南国夏种如潮。建设正如长征，踏破水远山遥。中国百年积弱，于今翻身十年。历尽风霜雨雪，奠定基础如磐。老年精神矍铄，青少吐气如虹。大家干劲十足，领导人人景从。
    一九五九年五一前夕
