Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 17th. In the first half of May, the quality of steel in Chongqing's steel plants has greatly improved, with the quality of converter steel increasing by 6.66% compared to April. The city's average daily steel production also increased by 19.44% compared to April.

The quality and output of steel at key steel plants in the city have improved particularly significantly in the past half-month. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's average daily steel production in the first half of May increased by 24% compared to April, and the ingot qualification rate increased by 6%. The average quality of converter steel at Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant in the first half of May increased by 33% compared to April, and the ingot qualification rate of open-hearth steel reached over 98%. While the quality significantly improved, the average daily steel production of the plant in the first half of May also increased by more than 19% compared to April. The steel plants have vigorously summarized and promoted advanced experiences in desulfurization, rapid steelmaking, etc., which has played an important role in the rapid increase in steel output and quality in the past half-month. In the first half of May, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company summarized and promoted a total of twenty-five advanced experiences in rapid steelmaking, rapid desulfurization, and rapid hoisting, solving the key problems of slow desulfurization speed and long smelting time in steelmaking production, ensuring the double leap forward in steel quality and output. On the basis of promoting the converter steelmaking experience of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, the converter steelmaking workshop of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant summarized the methods of multiple slag removal, multiple slag release, and increasing lime to increase alkalinity at the end of smelting, so that the average desulfurization effect reached 65%, the steel quality increased by 33% compared with the second half of April, and the output increased by 11.6%.

Since May, all steel plants in the city have focused on management work, which has also ensured the improvement of steel quality and output.

    快速脱硫　快速炼钢
    重庆各钢铁厂质量产量双双提高
    据新华社重庆17日电　5月上半月，重庆各钢铁厂钢的质量大有提高，其中，转炉钢的质量比4月份提高了6.66％；全市钢的平均日产量，也比4月份提高了19.44％。
    全市重点钢铁厂钢的质量、产量在这半个月里提高得尤其显著。重庆钢铁公司上半月钢的平均日产量比4月份提高了24％，钢锭合格率提高了6％。重庆第三钢铁厂转炉钢的平均质量，上半月比4月份提高了33％，平炉钢的钢锭合格率达到98％以上；在质量显著提高同时，全厂上半月钢的平均日产量也比4月份提高了19％以上。各钢铁厂大力总结和推广脱硫、快速炼钢等先进经验，对半个月来钢的产量、质量迅速上升起了重要作用。重庆钢铁公司5月上半月共总结推广了二十五项关于快速炼钢、快速脱硫和快速吊装等方面的先进经验，解决了炼钢生产中脱硫速度慢和冶炼时间长的关键，保证了钢的质量和产量双跃进。重庆第三钢铁厂转炉炼钢车间在推广上海第六钢铁厂转炉炼钢经验的基础上，总结出多扒渣、多放渣和熔炼末期增加石灰提高碱度的办法，使脱硫效果平均达到65％，钢的质量比4月下半月提高33％，产量提高11.6％。
    5月份以来，全市各钢厂都大抓管理工作，也保证了钢的质量和产量获得提高。
