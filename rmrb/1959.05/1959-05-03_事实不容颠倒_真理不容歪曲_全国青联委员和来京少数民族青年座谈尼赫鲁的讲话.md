Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The members of the Third Committee of the All-China Youth Federation discussed the speech made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on April 27 in the Indian House of the People regarding the situation in Tibet this afternoon. They pointed out that Nehru's speech distorted the truth of the Tibetan rebellion and, disregarding the facts, defended Indian expansionists and certain Indian newspapers who supported the Tibetan rebellion, interfered in China's internal affairs, and viciously attacked China. This is absolutely intolerable to Chinese youth and the Chinese people.

Participants in the discussion cited a large number of facts to refute Nehru's claim that the defamatory remarks and interference in China's internal affairs by some Indian politicians and newspapers were "not essentially political." Chen Mingshan said that the chairman of the ruling Indian National Congress party, Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi, had referred to Tibet as a "country," and India's High Commissioner in London, Nehru's sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, also said: "What I care about is whether Tibet, India, and other countries have the ability to resist countries (referring to China) that want to rule." Nehru himself even said that "Tibetans are not Chinese." Aren't these words political? Some Indian expansionists have falsely accused "China has always been an expansionist country," "China has threatened the Indian border," and even want to organize "volunteers" to Tibet to carry out the so-called "fight for freedom against the Chinese." Indian expansionists are not satisfied with using "Cold War" language and even clamor for "hot war." Doesn't this clearly show that they are interfering in China's internal affairs? What else is it if it is not "political"? Zhang Kaiyuan, a lecturer in the History Department of Central China Normal College, said that Narayan, the former leader of the Indian People's Socialist Party, openly declared at a meeting of the so-called "Indian Support Tibet Committee" in Mumbai that India should declare that "Tibet should be an independent country." He asked: Isn't this expansionism? Isn't this interference in China's internal affairs?

Wang Guangying said that some Indian newspapers even clamored for convening a "roundtable meeting between India, China, and Tibet," and Indian diplomatic officials distributed political so-called Dalai Lama statements. Aren't these political? Wang Guangying also refuted the notorious expansionist, the head of the Indian People's Socialist Party, Mehta's claim that India and Tibet have a "mother-child relationship." He asked: When did India have a mother-child relationship with Tibet, a territory of China, and when did it become a mother-child relationship? He said that if it is a "mother-child relationship," it is the "mother-child relationship" between Indian expansionists and the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet, and this is precisely the ignoble legacy of British imperialism. Since this is the case, it is no wonder that Indian expansionists were so saddened by the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as if they had lost their parents.

Nehru described a large number of defamatory remarks and acts of interference in China's internal affairs by some Indians as "mainly a sympathy based on emotional and humanitarian reasons" and "intimate feelings based on long-standing religious and cultural ties with the Tibetan people." Zhang Kaiyuan asked: Who exactly do you sympathize with? You have never expressed any real sympathy for the suffering of the more than 1.1 million Tibetans who have been under the darkest and most brutal serf owner exploitation for generations. What you sympathize with is only a small group of upper-class Tibetan reactionaries who have long tyrannically ruled the people and who inhumanly killed, set fires, raped, and plundered before and during the rebellion. Zhang Kaiyuan said: Nehru did not mention a word about the rebels' heinous crimes, but instead described China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as "killing." Nehru fully demonstrated here what his so-called "humanitarian sympathy" is all about. Liao Han, a student at the Chinese Buddhist Academy, said that the Tibetan rebels raped women, burned, killed, and looted everywhere, turning the Tibetan Plateau into a "hell on earth." Anyone with a humanitarian spirit must condemn these unscrupulous bandits, but Nehru was "saddened" by the failure of this small group of rebels.

Deng Yuzhi, General Secretary of the National Association of Chinese Christian Young Women, said that in Tibet, 5% of the serf owners owned all the land, and many kind Tibetan people lived in a hell on earth under the serf system. Serf owners could use inhumane methods such as whipping, gouging eyes, cutting off noses, gouging out hearts and livers, and skinning people alive to treat serfs. This system must be reformed, and this reform is the greatest humanitarianism for more than 1.1 million Tibetans. However, in order to maintain their dark rule and maintain the cruel serf system, the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries to launch an armed rebellion. What kind of "humanitarianism" is Nehru's so-called "humanitarian reason," and what kind of "religious feeling" is the so-called "religious feeling"?

The committee members also refuted Nehru's claim that the current situation in Tibet is a "tragedy" and that the basis of the Tibetan rebellion is "strong nationalistic sentiment."

The famous weightlifter Chen Jingkai said: The failure of the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet has made it possible for the Tibetan people to rise up and get rid of the shackles of the serf system. This is a great victory for the Tibetan people. Is this some kind of "tragedy"? Can a small group of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, that is, the most reactionary elements among the serf owners, represent the wishes of the Tibetan people? Why doesn't Nehru show "humanitarian spirit" to fully sympathize with the Tibetan people's desire for reform and progress? Yang Danzhu, a Tibetan youth from Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, said: "I grew up in a Tibetan area, and I deeply realize that the feudal serf system is the most cruel and dark social system, which seriously hinders social development and progress. If this system is not reformed, the Tibetan people cannot be liberated. Suppressing the Tibetan rebellion and carrying out democratic reforms in the Tibetan area are the urgent demands of the vast number of Tibetans and are a great happy event. It is difficult for me to understand where Nehru's sad emotions come from. The fact is very clear that Nehru and we have fundamentally different views on the Tibetan issue. What we sympathize with are the vast number of suffering people who have long suffered under the oppression of serf owners, while what Nehru sympathizes with are the few reactionary serf owners who ride on the people's heads and suck the people's blood. It is no wonder that Nehru wants to speak for the Tibetan rebels, grieve for them, and talk about "the rebellion is out of nationalistic sentiment."" Yang Danzhu also talked about the thriving new atmosphere in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture after the democratic reforms. He said, we believe that this great change will soon appear in Tibet. The young peasant Wang Zhiying said that peasants who have experienced the oppression and exploitation of the feudal landlord class deeply know the pain of that kind of life. The vast number of Tibetan people are under the oppression of the great serf owners who are more cruel than the landlord class, and we can understand their miserable lives, and it is natural for them to demand reforms. Why is Nehru so saddened by the failure of the reactionary serf owner rebellion?

Zhang Kaiyuan also mentioned that Nehru has repeatedly emphasized "courtesy" and "restraint." For more than a month, some people in India have violently interfered in China's internal affairs, using all kinds of vicious words to curse our country and leaders. We have always maintained calm and restraint, and only when it is unbearable have we made a solemn counterattack against these defamatory remarks and acts of interference. He said: Who is it that lacks "courtesy" and "restraint"? Isn't it obvious? In this speech, Nehru talked about the internal affairs of the Tibetan region of China as if he were talking about some problem in Bengal or Mumbai in India itself. Is this "courtesy" and "restraint"? Even the most reactionary "New York Herald Tribune" said that "Nehru asked Indian newspapers and Indian officials to use mild and precise language, but he himself chose unusually fierce words." Zhang Kaiyuan also said that Nehru once said that Premier Zhou told him in India in 1956 that communism cannot be imposed on a very backward country in this way.

Awang Cuocheng Living Buddha, Chairman of the Youth Federation of Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, pointed out sharply that the criminal activities of a small group of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet do not represent the interests of the Tibetan people at all. On the contrary, it is precisely what the Tibetan people firmly oppose. The fact that the vast number of monks and lay people in Tibet actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebellion is the most powerful proof. He said that if we talk about the nationalistic sentiments of the Tibetan people, then their sentiments have always been to love the motherland and to oppose the interference of imperialism and foreign reactionaries.

Li Zhun, Zhou Caiquan, Liao Yue, Aiyixian (Uyghur), Bai Wenda (Hui), Niu Zhifang and others also spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the Chinese people cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people very much and will continue to work to safeguard the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The conspiracy of Indian expansionists and all imperialists to undermine Sino-Indian friendship, interfere in China's internal affairs, and attempt to split China's unity will be completely crushed by the Chinese and Indian people.

The members of the All-China Youth Federation are discussing Nehru's speech at the second plenary meeting of the Third Committee, which opened on April 30. The meeting will discuss various issues related to youth work.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: A 140-member delegation of minority youth from Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces gathered in the capital today to study and discuss Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the situation in Tibet in the Indian House of the People on April 27.

At the meeting, youths of all ethnic groups unanimously agreed that Nehru's remarks on the issue of Tibet in China were not conducive to Sino-Indian friendship and only benefited imperialism. Yang Shengkui (Miao), head of the Guizhou Provincial Minority Youth Delegation, said: Prime Minister Nehru believes that suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is a "tragedy." We believe it is a great thing. Our rapid suppression of the rebellion has liberated the Tibetan people from the dark, backward, and brutal serf system as soon as possible. This is by no means a tragedy for all ethnic groups in our country or for the Tibetan people. It is only a tragedy for the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, imperialism, and the Indian expansionists who inherited the mantle of British imperialism. Nehru also said: "If the Tibetan rebellion is entirely the responsibility of some 'upper-class reactionary elements' in Tibet, it seems that this statement simplifies an unusually complex situation." I think Nehru's statement is a bit simple, because these traitors have a backstage, that is, imperialism and Indian expansionists.

Jiang Jiang, a young Tibetan farmer from Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, said angrily: Many of our Tibetan compatriots were killed by those inhumane rebels. Our Tibetan people have completely recognized the faces of this small group of jackals. They are the deadly enemies of our Tibetan people, but Nehru said that they have some strong "nationalistic sentiments." All they have is treasonous sentiments and the beastliness of slaughtering the Tibetan people. I read Nehru's speech carefully, and I think what he sympathizes with are only the Tibetan traitors, but he does not have a trace of sympathy for the vast number of Tibetan people who have suffered. Therefore, I firmly oppose what he said.

Li Hengsong, Vice Chairman of the Islamic Association of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Ahong, said: "I think Nehru's speech violates the spirit of the Five Principles. Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory, and suppressing the rebellion is our country's internal affairs. We will never allow any foreigners to interfere. From our personal experience, we minority youth understand that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the minority ethnic groups in our country be liberated and live a happy life. We will resolutely disagree with anyone who slanders our brotherly ethnic relations.

Qin Zhengxun, a Bouyei youth from Guizhou, said: Prime Minister Nehru not only did not stop the vicious attacks and slanders against our country and the arrogant acts of interference in our country's internal affairs by some Indian politicians and newspapers recently, but instead said that this "is not political." We want to ask Mr. Nehru: If a rebellion occurs in India, and someone crazily supports this rebellion, is it also "not political"?

Jia San Awei, a Yi girl from Ninglang County, Yunnan Province, said: I used to be a slave. I grazed sheep for the slave owner since I was a child. I was often hungry and beaten. At that time, slaves could only be enslaved by slave owners for the rest of their lives. Only the Party liberated us from the suffering of the slave system. This is something we can never forget for generations. However, Nehru's recent speech on the issue of Tibet is obviously defending the Tibetan rebels and preventing the Tibetan people from being liberated from the serf system. This is something we cannot agree to.

The minority youth delegations from Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces came to the capital to participate in the "May Day" National Day celebrations. They include 20 minority ethnic groups such as Tibetan, Hui, Miao, Zhuang, Bouyei, Yi, Hani, Lisu, Lahu, Kawa, Dai, Jingpo, and Mongolian. Among them are Ahongs, Buddhas, liberated slaves and serfs, as well as members of rural people's communes, production team leaders, nurses, teachers, actors, and canteen workers. They represent the vast number of minority youth in Ningxia, Yunnan, and Guizhou.

    事实不容颠倒　真理不容歪曲
    全国青联委员和来京少数民族青年座谈尼赫鲁的讲话
    新华社2日讯　中华全国青年联合会第三届委员会的委员们今天下午讨论了印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院就西藏局势发表的讲话。他们指出，尼赫鲁的讲话歪曲了西藏叛乱事件的真相，并且不顾事实，为印度扩张主义分子和某些印度报刊支持西藏叛乱、干涉中国内政、对中国进行恶毒攻击作辩解。这是为中国青年和中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    参加讨论的人举出大量事实，驳斥了尼赫鲁认为印度一些政界人士和报刊发表的对中国的诽谤性言论和干涉我国内政的行为“实质上不是政治性的”说法。陈铭珊说，印度执政党国大党的主席、尼赫鲁的女儿甘地夫人曾把西藏说成是一个
  “国家”，印度驻伦敦高级专员、尼赫鲁的妹妹潘迪特夫人也说：“我关心的是西藏、印度和其他国家是否有能力起来抵抗想进行统治的国家（指中国）”，尼赫鲁本人甚至说过“西藏人不是中国人”，这些话难道不是政治性的吗？某些印度扩张主义分子诬蔑“中国一直是一个扩张主义国家”“中国威胁了印度边境”，甚至要组织“志愿军”到西藏进行所谓“反对中国人的争取自由的战斗”，印度扩张主义分子用“冷战”语言还嫌不够，甚至叫嚣要搞“热战”，这还不明显地说明他们是干涉中国的内政吗？这不是“政治性”的又是什么呢？华中师范学院历史系讲师章开源说，印度前人民社会党领袖纳拉扬在孟买的所谓“印度支援西藏委员会”的一次集会上公然宣称印度应当宣布“西藏应该是个独立的国家”，他问道：这不是扩张主义是什么？这不是干涉中国内政是什么？
    王光英说，有的印度报纸甚至叫嚷要召开“印度、中国、西藏三方面的圆桌会议”，印度外交官员散发了政治性的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，这些都不是政治性的吗？王光英还驳斥了臭名昭著的扩张主义分子、印度人民社会党头子梅达所谓印度和西藏是“母子关系”的说法，他问道：印度在什么时候同中国的领土西藏有过母子关系，又在什么时候成了母子关系？他说，如果说是“母子关系”，那是印度扩张主义分子同西藏上层反动集团之间的
  “母子关系”，而这正是英帝国主义的不光荣的遗产。既然如此，就难怪印度扩张主义分子如丧考妣地对西藏叛乱的迅速平定感到悲哀难过了。
    尼赫鲁把某些印度人对中国内政的大量诽谤言论和干涉行为说成
  “主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情”，是“基于同西藏人民久远的宗教和文化联系所造成的亲密感情”。章开源问道：你们究竟同情谁呢？对一百一十多万世代处于最黑暗、最残酷的农奴主压榨之下的西藏人民的痛苦遭遇，你们从来没有表示过任何真正的同情，你们同情的，只是长期以来暴虐地统治人民而在叛乱前后灭绝人性地杀人放火、奸淫掳掠的一小撮西藏上层反动分子。章开源说：尼赫鲁对叛匪的滔天罪行只字未提，反而把我国平息西藏叛乱说成是“杀戮”，尼赫鲁在这里充分表明了他的所谓
  “人道同情”是怎么一回事。中国佛学院学员了瀚说，西藏叛乱分子到处奸淫妇女，烧杀抢掠，把西藏高原变为“人间地狱”，凡是具有人道主义精神的人，对这些无恶不作的匪徒莫不同声讨伐，而尼赫鲁却为这一小撮叛匪的失败而“难过”。
    中华基督教女青年会全国协会总干事邓裕志说，在西藏，5％的农奴主占有了全部土地，多少善良的西藏人民在农奴制度下过着人间地狱的生活。农奴主可以用鞭打、挖眼、割鼻、挖心肝、抽筋剥皮等惨绝人寰的手段，对待农奴。这种制度必须改革，这种改革对一百一十几万西藏人民说来是最大的人道主义。可是，西藏上层反动集团为了维持他们的黑暗统治，维持残酷的农奴制度，勾结帝国主义和外国反动派发动了武装叛乱。尼赫鲁的所谓“人道原因”是一种什么样的“人道”，所谓“宗教感情”又是一种什么样的“宗教感情”呢？
    委员们还驳斥了尼赫鲁把目前西藏局势说做是“悲剧”和西藏叛乱的基础是“强烈的民族主义情绪”的说法。
    著名的举重运动员陈镜开说：西藏上层反动分子叛乱的失败，使西藏人民有可能起来摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，这是西藏人民翻天复地的大胜利，难道这是什么“悲剧”吗？难道西藏一小撮上层反动分子，即农奴主中最反动的分子，能够代表西藏人民的愿望吗？西藏广大人民要求改革和进步的愿望，尼赫鲁为什么不拿出“人道精神”给以充分的同情呢？来自甘南藏族自治州的藏族青年杨丹珠说：“我生长在藏族地区，我深深体会到封建农奴制度是一种最残酷最黑暗的社会制度，严重地阻碍社会的发展和进步，这种制度如果不加以改革，藏族人民就不可能得到解放。平定西藏叛乱、在西藏地区进行民主改革是广大藏胞迫不及待的要求，是一件大喜事。我很难理解尼赫鲁的悲哀情绪是从何而来。事实很明显，尼赫鲁和我们对西藏问题的看法有着根本的不同点。我们所同情的是那些长期在农奴主压迫下受苦受难的广大劳苦人民，而尼赫鲁所同情的是那些骑在人民头上的吸吮人民血汗的少数反动农奴主。这难怪尼赫鲁要为西藏叛乱分子喊冤，为他们悲伤，大谈什么“叛乱是出于民族情绪。”杨丹珠还谈到了甘南藏族自治州在民主改革后所出现的一片欣欣向荣的新气象。他说，我们相信，这种伟大变革，不久也会出现在西藏。青年农民王志英说，经受过封建地主阶级压迫和剥削的农民，是深深知道那种生活的痛苦的。西藏广大人民是处在比地主阶级更加残酷的大农奴主的压迫之下，他们的悲惨生活是我们能够体会到的，他们要求改革也是很自然的。尼赫鲁对反动农奴主叛乱的失败为什么这样难过呢？
    章开源还谈到，尼赫鲁不止一次地强调“礼节”和“节制”。一个多月以来，印度的某些人狂暴地干涉我国内政，用尽一切恶毒的字眼来咒骂我们的国家和领袖，我们一直保持着冷静和克制，只在忍无可忍的时候才对这些诽谤言论和干涉行为进行了严正的反击。他说：究竟是谁没有“礼节”和“节制”，不是很明显吗？尼赫鲁在这篇讲话中谈论中国西藏地区的内部事务就像是谈印度本国孟加拉或孟买的什么问题一样，这难道是有“礼节”和“节制”的吗？甚至连最反动的
  “纽约先驱论坛报”都说，“尼赫鲁要求印度的报纸和印度的官员们使用温和确切的语言，可是他自己却选择了异乎寻常地激烈的措辞”。章开源还说，尼赫鲁曾说周总理1956年在印度时曾对他说，共产主义是不能以这种方式强加在一个非常落后的国家的。
    四川阿坝藏族自治州青年联谊会主席阿旺措成活佛一针见血地指出，西藏一小撮上层反动分子的罪恶活动绝不是代表西藏人民的利益，恰恰相反，正是西藏人民所坚决反对的。西藏广大僧俗人民积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱的事实，就是一个最有力不过的证明。他说，如果说到西藏人民的民族主义情绪的话，那末，他们的情绪就是一贯地爱护祖国，一贯地反对帝国主义和外国反动派的干涉。
    李准、周才全、廖越、阿衣先
  （维吾尔族）、白文达（回族）、钮志芳等都在会上发了言。他们指出，中国人民非常珍惜同印度人民之间的友谊，并且要继续为维护和平共处五项原则而努力。印度扩张主义分子和一切帝国主义分子破坏中印友谊、干涉我国内政、妄图分裂中国统一的阴谋，将为中印人民彻底粉碎。
    全国青联的委员们是在第三届委员会第二次全体会议上讨论尼赫鲁的讲话的，这次会议是4月30日开幕的，会议将要讨论有关青年工作的各项问题。
    新华社2日讯　宁夏回族自治区和云南、贵州两个省的少数民族青年参观团一百四十人，今天在首都集会，研究和讨论印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院关于西藏局势问题的讲话。
    会上，各族青年一致认为尼赫鲁关于我国西藏问题的一些言论，不利于中印友好，只有利于帝国主义。贵州省少数民族青年参观团团长（苗族）杨胜奎说：尼赫鲁总理认为平息西藏叛乱是个“悲剧”，我们认为是个大好事。我们迅速平定了叛乱，使西藏人民早日从黑暗、落后、残暴的农奴制度下解放出来，这对我国各兄弟民族来说，对西藏人民来说，决不是悲剧；只有对西藏上层反动分子、帝国主义和继承了英帝国主义衣钵的印度扩张主义分子来说，才是悲剧。尼赫鲁还说：“如果西藏叛乱完全要由西藏若干‘上层反动分子’负责，看来这种说法是把一种复杂情况异乎寻常地简单化了”。我认为，像尼赫鲁这样说法倒是简单了些，因为这些叛国分子是有后台的，那就是帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子。
    云南省迪庆藏族自治州的青年农民姜江气愤地说：我们许多藏族同胞就是被那些惨无人道的叛匪杀害的，我们藏族人民已经完全认清了这一小撮豺狼的面目，他们是我们藏族人民的死敌，而尼赫鲁却说他们有什么强烈的“民族主义情绪”。他们有的只是卖国情绪和残杀藏族人民的兽性。我细看了尼赫鲁的讲话，我认为他同情的只是西藏的叛国分子，而对西藏受苦受难的广大藏族人民却一丝也没有同情心。所以，我坚决反对他说的那些话。
    宁夏回族自治区伊斯兰教协会副主席、阿訇李恒松说：“我认为尼赫鲁的讲话是违反五项原则的精神的。西藏是我国不可分割的领土，平叛是我国的内政，我们决不允许任何外国人插手。我们少数民族青年从亲身的体会中，懂得只有在共产党的领导下，我国少数民族才能获得解放和幸福生活，任何人对我国兄弟般的民族关系进行污蔑，我们都是坚决不答应的。
    贵州布依族青年覃政勋说：尼赫鲁总理对最近印度某些政界人士和报刊恶毒攻击、污蔑我国的言论和狂妄干涉我国内政的行为，不但不加制止，反而说这“不是政治性的”，我们要问问尼赫鲁先生：如果印度发生了叛乱，有人疯狂支持这种叛乱，也“不是政治性”的吗？
    云南省宁蒗县的彝族女青年加三阿尾说：我过去是个奴隶，从小给奴隶主放羊，常常挨饿挨打，那时，奴隶只能一辈子被奴隶主奴役。只有党才把我们从奴隶制度的痛苦下面解放出来了，这是我们子孙万代也不能忘记的。但最近尼赫鲁关于西藏问题的讲话，却是明显地为西藏叛乱分子辩护，不让西藏人民从农奴制下解放出来，这是我们决不能同意的。
    宁夏回族自治区和云南、贵州两省的少数民族青年参观团是来首都参加“五一”节观礼的，他们包括藏、回、苗、僮、布依、彝、哈尼、傈僳、拉祜、佧佤、傣、景颇、蒙古等二十个少数民族。他们中间有阿訇、佛爷。解放了的奴隶和农奴，也有农村人民公社的社员、生产队长、护士、教师、演员、食堂工作者。他们代表着宁夏、云南、贵州地区广大的少数民族青年。
