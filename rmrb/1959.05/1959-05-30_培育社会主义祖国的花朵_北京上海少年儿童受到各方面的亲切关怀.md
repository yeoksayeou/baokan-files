Xinhua News Agency, 29th. In the capital, the children are receiving care from all sectors of society.
　　Many veteran revolutionaries, advanced workers, scientists, writers, and artists in the capital are educating children through various means. Wu Yunduo, the author of "Dedicate Everything to the Party," helped the Haidian District Children's Home establish a Young Pioneer factory last November, using his own royalties to purchase various production tools for the factory and making time to personally guide the young workers in their operations. Li Molin, a vegetable production expert and captain of the vegetable production team of the Sijiqing People's Commune, takes time to explain agricultural techniques to the children at Jingshan Park, personally guiding them in planting vegetables, and encouraging them to learn how to grow vegetables today and become agricultural production experts tomorrow. Zhi Shunyi, a close comrade-in-arms of the combat hero Dong Cunrui, often tells children battle stories and sometimes recites poems encouraging children to strive for progress. Children also often receive instruction from scientists such as Gao Shiqi, science workers such as Jiang Younong, and writers such as Chen Bochui, Ye Shengtao, and Ke Yan. Not long ago, Ye Shengtao met with children at the Beijing Municipal Children's Library, encouraging them to read more and pay attention to connecting reading with practice. Chen Bochui is a familiar big friend to the children of Haidian District, and he not only writes for children but also often works with them in small factories.
　　Before liberation, Beijing did not have a single after-school educational institution for children. Since liberation, the city has established 102 after-school educational institutions, including children's palaces, children's science and technology museums, children's homes, children's sports fields, libraries, and children's activity stations. Even most of the districts in the suburbs have established children's homes. The Children's Science and Technology Museum, built in Beihai Park, has a children's factory and more than a dozen activity groups such as chemistry, aviation, navigation, astronomy, telecommunications, internal combustion engines, and hydropower stations, where children learn a lot of common sense about science and technology. In order to give children a good education in their spare time, and to provide a place for a small number of preschool children who have not yet entered childcare organizations to receive education and play, street residents have also organized some children's activity points. For example, the Erlong Road Dashaguo Residents' Committee recently organized a "Children's Paradise" at the request of mothers, where children who have not yet entered school come to play games, listen to stories, and read children's books for two hours every day. The "Paradise" has no fixed location, sometimes in the courtyard, sometimes in the house, and is tutored by Communist Youth League members or female activists on the street.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. The more than three million children in Shanghai have received meticulous care from the Party, the government, and all sectors of society. At present, there are more than 1.5 million primary school students in the city, more than three times more than before liberation; the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced, and the infant mortality rate in 1958 was only 20% of that before liberation.
　　Shanghai's maternal and child health care network has been formed. There are now 15 obstetrical hospitals, more than 120 maternal and child health stations (centers), and five children's hospitals in the city. Health agencies generally provide free vaccinations such as BCG to infants, and acute infectious diseases that seriously threaten the health of young children have also been greatly reduced compared with before liberation. For example, smallpox has long been eradicated, and the incidence of diphtheria in 1958 was 97.1% lower than in 1950, the early period after liberation.
　　Shanghai now has more than 26,000 nurseries and kindergartens, in a variety of forms, including full-time, day-care, half-day, night-care, and temporary care, and mothers can decide when to send their children to care based on their own circumstances. The number of nurseries and kindergartens run by neighborhood residents was only 147 in 1955, but has now grown to more than 2,600, caring for more than 130,000 young children. The Ai Qun Nursery, a neighborhood nursery in Xuhui District, cares for 39 children aged two to four. In the first three months of this year, the children gained an average of 1 jin and 6 liang (approximately 0.8 kg) in weight per month, which has been unanimously praised by parents. In nurseries and kindergartens, children not only receive the greatest care for their health, but also receive a good education and develop diverse interests.
　　In order to comprehensively develop children's moral character, knowledge, and physical fitness, all sectors of Shanghai have also organized a large number of undertakings to serve children. The city and each district have children's libraries, children's palaces, and "children's homes," as well as a children's art theater. There are now a total of thirteen children's parks in the city, and more than ten other large parks also have children's playgrounds. In the sixteen children's natural science laboratories (stations), children can study more than a dozen science and technology projects such as radio, meteorology, or photography according to their preferences. Since its establishment on "June 1st" in 1957, the Shanghai Children's Science and Technology Guidance Station has had an average of more than 3,000 children engaged in various research activities every week. There are also many children's amateur sports schools in the city, which have increased the opportunities for children who love sports to learn and exercise.

    培育社会主义祖国的花朵
    北京上海少年儿童受到各方面的亲切关怀
    新华社29日讯　在首都，少年儿童受到了社会上各方面的关怀。
    首都的许多革命老前辈、先进工作者、科学家、文学家、艺术家，通过各种方式教育少年儿童。“把一切献给党”的作者吴运铎，去年11月帮助海淀区少年之家建立了一个红领巾工厂，用他自己的稿费给工厂购买各种生产工具，并且挤出时间亲自去指导小工人操作。蔬菜生产能手、四季青人民公社蔬菜生产队队长李墨林，抽出时间到景山公园给孩子们讲解农业技术，亲手指导孩子们种菜，他勉励孩子们今天学会种菜，明天成为农业生产上的能手。战斗英雄董存瑞生前亲密的战友郅顺义常常给孩子讲战斗故事，有时还朗诵勉励孩子努力进步的诗篇。孩子们还常常受到科学家高士其，科学工作者江幼农，作家陈伯吹、叶圣陶、柯岩等人的教益。不久前，叶圣陶在北京市少年儿童图书馆和孩子们见面，他勉励孩子们要多读书，并在读书时注意联系实际。陈伯吹是海淀区孩子们熟悉的大朋友，他不仅为孩子们写作，还常常在小工厂里和孩子一起劳动。
    北京市在解放前没有一所为孩子设立的校外教育机构，解放以来，全市已建立了校外教育机构一百零二所，其中包括少年宫、少年科学技术馆、少年之家、儿童体育场、图书馆、少年儿童活动站等，连郊区的大部分区也都建立了少年之家。建立在北海公园中的少年科学技术馆，设有一座少年工厂和化学、航空、航海、天文、电讯、内燃机、水电站等十多个活动小组，孩子们在这里学习到了许多科学技术常识。为了让儿童在课余受到良好教育，使一小部分还没进托儿组织的学龄前儿童也有受教育和玩耍的场所，街道居民们还举办了一些少年儿童活动点。如二龙路大沙果居民委员会最近就在妈妈们的要求下，举办了一个“儿童乐园”，未入学的孩子们每天有两小时到“乐园”里来做游戏、听故事、看儿童书。“乐园”没有固定地点，有时在院子里，有时在屋子里，由街道上的共青团员或妇女积极分子作辅导。
    新华社上海29日电　上海市的三百多万少年儿童，受到了党、政府和社会各方面无微不至的关怀。目前全市的小学生有一百五十多万，比解放前增加了三倍多；婴儿的死亡率则大为降低，1958年的婴儿死亡率仅为解放前的20％。
    上海市的妇幼保健网已经形成，现在全市共有十五所产科医院、一百二十多个妇幼保健站（所）和五所儿童医院。各卫生机关普遍对婴儿免费进行卡介苗等各种疫苗的接种，严重威胁幼儿健康的急性传染病也比解放前大为减少，例如天花早已绝迹，白喉的发病率1958年比解放初期的1950年减少了97.1％。
    上海市现在有二万六千多个托儿所、幼儿园，而且方式多样，有全托、日托、半托、夜托、临时托，母亲可以根据自己的情况决定孩子送托的时间。里弄居民办的托儿所和幼儿园，在1955年时还只有一百四十七个，目前已发展到二千六百多个，受托的幼儿有十三万多人。徐汇区一个里弄托儿所——爱群托儿所，受托三十九个二岁到四岁的孩子，今年头三个月内孩子们平均每人每月增加体重一斤六两，得到家长们的一致称赞。在托儿所和幼儿园里，孩子们不仅健康受到最大的关怀，而且还受到良好的教育，培养了多方面的兴趣。
    为了使儿童的道德品质、知识、和身体得到全面的发展，上海市各界还举办了大量为儿童服务的事业。市和各区都设有少年儿童图书馆、少年宫和“少年之家”，还设有儿童艺术剧场。全市现在一共有十三个儿童公园，其他十多个大公园中，也都设有儿童游戏场。在十六个少年儿童自然科学实验室（站）里，孩子们可以根据自己的喜爱研究无线电、气象或摄影等十多种科学技术项目。上海少年科学技术指导站从1957年“六一”成立以来，平均每星期有三千多个少年儿童在这里从事各种研究活动。全市还有许多少年儿童业余体育学校，为爱好体育的孩子们增加了学习和锻炼的机会。（附图片）
