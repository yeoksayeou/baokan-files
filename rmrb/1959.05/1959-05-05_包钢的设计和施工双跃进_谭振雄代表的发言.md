Comrades Chairman and Delegates:
    I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
    In 1958, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, with soaring energy and striving for the upper reaches, achieved unprecedented and comprehensive great harvests and great leaps forward on all fronts, writing heroic deeds of "one day equals twenty years." In this great year, all the workers of Baotou Steel, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, overfulfilled the various planned targets for production and construction. This is a victory for the general line of socialist construction and a victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the country.
    In 1958, design and construction at Baotou Steel promoted each other, achieving a double leap forward. The annual basic construction plan and the construction and installation workload plan leaped forward three times. As a result, the national investment plan was overfulfilled by 108.7%, and the construction and installation workload overfulfilled the national plan by 105.7%. The construction progress leapt forward again and again, and major engineering projects were completed ahead of schedule. Among the 57 projects actually completed throughout the year, 19 were completed one to four months ahead of the original plan. The industrial building area completed throughout the year exceeded more than twice the building area completed during the First Five-Year Plan. 7 million cubic meters of earthwork were excavated and filled, and 13,000 cubic meters of refractory bricks were laid, equivalent to building more than 160 blast furnaces each with a volume of 55 cubic meters. The engineering technology was complex and the quality requirements were high. For example, in the Yellow River water source project, various difficulties of underground quicksand and underwater blasting were overcome, and the quality met the requirements. In the construction of the No. 4 coke oven, the furnace body was built with refractory bricks, and there were more than 500 types of 12,000 tons of bricks. The people who built the coke oven created a new record of completing the construction in 37 days. The people who built the No. 1 blast furnace created a record of pouring the foundation of the blast furnace in 22.5 hours with excellent quality. The total length of the welding seams of the blast furnace body and the hot blast stove shell was more than 4,000 meters, and the steel plate was 36 mm thick. Not only was the project completed ahead of schedule, but the pass rate reached 99.9%. There are many other examples. The significance of these achievements is very great, proving that as long as the masses are mobilized, hard work, practical work, and ingenious work can master complex technologies and overcome difficulties, proving that "good" and "fast" are not contradictory, but unified, liberating thinking, and increasing confidence in accelerating the construction of Baotou Steel.
    The design work of Baotou Steel also made great improvements and progress in the great leap forward year of last year. In terms of design speed, it has basically changed the situation where the design could not keep up with the construction, and completed various construction drawings required for construction within the year for a modern iron and steel joint enterprise with international standards. For example, the large blast furnace system with an effective volume of 1,513 cubic meters, the large open-hearth steelmaking workshop, the rolling mill of 1,150 mm primary rolling mill, and the rolling mill of 800/650 mm rolling large steel. These projects are huge in scale, complex in technology, and advanced in equipment level.
    In 1958, 51 design projects proposed by the institute were said to be very tight, requiring an increase of 130 to 300 people. Later, a leap forward plan of 95 projects was proposed. As a result, by the end of the year, the original designers basically did not increase, but a total of 357 projects were completed, exceeding the quota by more than 600%. Originally, the design of Baotou Steel's 1,150 primary rolling mill was something they didn't even dare to think about. As a result, they vigorously carried out mass movements and were able to design it themselves, and completed it in only three months. In the past, it took two years to design a 820 cubic meter blast furnace, but the design institute handed over the ironmaking design of Baotou Steel in only two months, and also handed over the steelmaking design four months ahead of schedule. The design institute's change of the 3,600 cubic meter steel structure water tower to a reinforced concrete structure water tower is a bold initiative.
    From raw material mining to finished products, an iron and steel joint enterprise needs hundreds of various production workshops and auxiliary workshops. Nine different professional design institutes at home and abroad cooperate with each other to carry out this work together. In addition, many professional design institutes in the Soviet Union have given us a lot of multi-faceted help in the specific design and various design materials. Through domestic cooperation and Soviet assistance, the design of mines with an annual output of more than 10 million tons has been completed; the technically complex ore dressing and sintering plants and coal washing plant designs for processing raw materials; the refractory material plants, steel plants, concrete prefabricated parts plants, ferroalloy plants, and machine repair plants for repair and maintenance that supply materials for infrastructure construction and production; a series of laboratories for raw material and finished product inspection and scientific research in production; and a huge public utility system including a large gas generating station, thermal power station, water intake measures from the Yellow River, industrial oxygen supply, compressed air supply, and a modern transportation network mainly based on belt conveyors and supplemented by railway transportation. Around these major projects, there are hundreds of auxiliary buildings, welfare facilities, etc. The design department has successively made various construction designs and related technical documents for these constructions. While carrying out the design of large foreign joint enterprises, the policy of combining large, medium and small was implemented, and the design of medium-sized local iron and steel plants and small local plants in the four autonomous regions and provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu and Ningxia was carried out, and the design production capacity of more than 2 million tons per year was completed. Most of these designs are in the construction stage, and some have been successfully put into production. Practice shows that these workshops and factories meet the requirements of more, faster, better and more economical, and meet the needs of the great leap forward in the steel industry.
    The great leap forward in design work is the result of a great harvest and great leap forward in ideology and politics. Under the correct leadership of the Party, after the anti-Rightist struggle and the great rectification movement, heart-to-heart talks and the red and expert debate, the bourgeois ideology was discredited, and the bourgeois intellectuals recognized their own position. Most people actively and proactively demanded self-transformation, and the designers have greatly improved their thinking. In the double-anti and red-expert debates, ideological understanding was improved, which further laid the foundation for opposing dogmatism in design, carrying out technological innovation, designing in combination with reality, following the mass line, and implementing the three-in-one combination.
    In the design work, we began to learn to follow the mass line. Before 1958, many people believed that the mass line could be followed in industrial and mining enterprises, but such brain work and technically strong work as the design department could not carry out mass movements. After studying and practicing several movements, senior intellectuals also realized that to do a good job, they must follow the mass line. In the specific design work, the practice of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, combining production, construction, and design, and twisting three strands into one rope has gradually formed a trend and habit in the work.
    In 1959, the national plan listed the construction of Baotou Steel as one of the national key projects, requiring Baotou Steel to partially put into production and participate in the struggle to seize 18 million tons of steel. According to the above requirements, our design task is still very heavy, the technical requirements are complex, most of the projects must be completed in the first half of the year, the types of projects are many, and most of the drawings are issued for immediate construction. Temporary measures, rush tasks, material replacement, and equipment changes will also be many during construction. Therefore, the corresponding design supplementary and modification workload is also very large. Moreover, most of the projects have production tasks assigned this year, so the design must be meticulous and technically very reliable before construction and putting into production. Our task is arduous, and we must overcome difficulties and strive for victory on the basis of the Party's centralized leadership and following the mass line. We must take Baotou Steel as the center, and at the same time complete the design of local small and medium-sized factories, and promote the comprehensive completion of Baotou Steel construction and local construction. We must combine hard work and ingenious work, improve labor productivity, complete various leap forward targets, and promote the upsurge of production and construction. We must develop the results of the rectification movement, go deep into the masses, go deep into reality, and continue to implement the working method of combining cadres, technical personnel, and workers in the design work, so that the design is more in line with actual needs and improves the quality of design. Let us, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, strive to complete and over fulfill the plan to welcome our great 10th anniversary of the National Day!

    包钢的设计和施工双跃进
    谭振雄代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理和李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    一九五八年全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，鼓足干劲力争上游取得了各个战线空前的全面的大丰收大跃进，写下了“一天等于二十年”的英雄事迹。在这伟大的一年，包钢的全体职工在党的领导下，在全国人民的支援和苏联无私的帮助下，超额地完成生产建设的各项计划指标，这是社会主义建设总路线的胜利，这是全国各民族人民的胜利。
    一九五八年包钢设计和施工互相促进，双双跃进。年度基本建设计划和建筑安装工作量计划三次跃进，执行结果超额完成国家投资计划108.7％，建筑安装工作量超额完成国家计划105.7％。施工进度一跃再跃，重大工程项目纷纷提前竣工，全年实际竣工项目五十七项中，比原计划提前一至四个月的就有十九项，全年建成的工业建筑面积比第一个五年计划建成的建筑面积超过两倍还多，挖填土方完成七百万立公尺，砌筑耐火砖一点三万立方公尺，相当于砌五十五立公尺的高炉一百六十多座。工程的技术复杂，质量要求高，如黄河水源地工程中，战胜了地下流砂和水下爆破的种种困难，质量达到要求。四号焦炉炉体砌耐火砖，一点二万多吨砖的型号有五百多种，建设焦炉的人们创造了三十七天砌完的新纪录，建设一号高炉的人们以优等质量创造了二十二点五小时浇灌完高炉基础的纪录，高炉炉体和热风炉炉壳焊接缝总长达四千多公尺，钢板厚达三十六公厘，又是高空作业又是快速施工，不但提前完成，而且合格率达到百分之九十九点九，其他还有很多的事例。取得这些成绩的意义是非常大的，证明只要发动群众，苦干、实干、巧干是可以掌握复杂的技术，战胜难关，证明，“好”和“快”不是矛盾，而是统一的，解放了思想，增加了加速建设包钢的信心。
    包钢的设计工作在去年大跃进的一年中也有很大的提高和进展，在设计的速度方面已经基本上改变了设计赶不上施工的情况，为现代化的具有国际水平的钢铁联合企业完成年度内施工所需要的各项施工图。例如一千五百一十三立公尺有效容积的大高炉系统，规模巨大的平炉炼钢车间和一千一百五十公厘初轧机的轧钢厂，800／650公厘的轧制大型钢材的轧钢厂。这些项目在规模上是巨大的，在技术上是复杂的，在装备水平上是先进的。
    一九五八年提出的院设计计划项目五十一项，大家都说很紧张，需增加一百三十至三百人，后来提出跃进计划九十五项，结果到年底原有的设计人员基本上没有增加，却共完成了三百五十七项，超额百分之六百强。原来包钢的一千一百五十初轧厂设计，认为自己连想都不敢想，结果大搞群众运动，自己能设计了，而且仅仅用了三个月就完成了。过去一个八百二十立方公尺的高炉设计需两年，而设计院仅用了两个月就交出了包钢的炼铁设计，还提前四个月交出了炼钢设计。设计院把三千六百立方公尺的钢结构大水塔改为钢筋混凝土结构的水塔，是一个大胆的创举。
    钢铁联合企业从原料开采到制成成品需要上百个各种各样生产车间和辅助车间，前后国共内有九个不同专业的设计院相互配合协作来共同进行这项工作。另外苏联很多专业设计院在具体的设计上和各种设计资料方面，给了我们大量的多方面的帮助。通过国内协作和苏联的援助，完成了年产量超过一千万吨的矿山设计；技术复杂的处理原料的选矿烧结厂和洗煤厂设计；供给基建和生产的材料的耐火材料厂、钢材厂、混凝土预制品厂、铁合金厂以及为修理维护的机修厂；原料成品的检验、生产上科学研究的一系列的试验室；和庞大的公用系统包括很大的煤气发生站、热电站，自黄河取水措施，工业用的氧气供应、压缩空气供应和现代化的以皮带运输机为主、以铁路运输为辅助的运输网。围绕这些主要工程设有上百个辅助建筑物、福利设施等等。设计方面为这些建设陆续作了各种施工设计以及有关的各种技术文件。在搞大的洋的联合企业设计的同时，贯彻了大中小相结合的方针，作了内蒙、山西、甘肃、宁夏四个自治区、省的中型地方钢铁厂设计和小型地方厂的设计，完成了年产二百余万吨的设计生产能力。这些设计大部分在施工阶段，有的已经顺利投入生产，实践说明这些车间工厂是符合多快好省的要求，满足钢铁大跃进的形势需要的。
    设计工作的大跃进是思想上政治上大丰收大跃进的结果，在党的正确领导下，经过反右派斗争和伟大的整风运动、交心和红专辩论，搞臭了资产阶级思想，资产阶级知识分子认清了自己的立场，大多数人积极的、主动的要求自我改造，设计人员在思想上有很大的提高。在双反、红专辩论中思想认识提高了，进一步为反掉设计中的教条主义，搞技术革新，为结合实际设计，走群众路线，实行三结合打下基础。
    在设计工作中我们开始学会了走群众路线，在一九五八年以前，很多人认为工矿企业里可以走群众路线，而像设计部门这样脑力劳动、技术性强的工作就不能大搞群众运动，经过学习和几次运动的实践，高级知识分子，也认识到工作要作好就要走群众路线，在具体的设计工作中，实行领导干部、技术人员、工人三结合，生产方面、施工方面和设计方面三结合，三股劲拧成一股绳的作法在工作中逐步形成一种风气和习惯。
    一九五九年国家计划把包钢建设列为全国重点之一，要求包钢部分投入生产，参加到争夺一千八百万吨钢的斗争行列里去。根据以上要求，我们的设计任务还是很重的，技术要求复杂，大部分项目要在上半年完成，项目的种类较多，发出图纸大部分是立即施工，在施工中临时措施，突击任务，材料换用，设备变更亦会很多的。因此，相应的设计补充修改工作量也很大。而且大部分项目今年就分配有生产任务，因此在施工及投入生产前，设计必须作到一丝不苟，技术上要十分可靠。我们的任务是艰巨的，必须在党的集中领导与大走群众路线的基础上克服困难争取胜利。必须以包钢为重心，同时完成地方中小厂设计，促进包钢建设与地方建设全面完成。必须苦干与巧干相结合，提高劳动生产率，完成各项跃进指标，促进生产建设的高潮。必须发展整风成果，深入群众，深入实际，继续实行在设计工作中干部、技术人员、工人三结合的工作方法，设计更切合实际需要，提高设计质量。让我们在党和毛主席的领导下，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，努力完成和超额完成计划，来迎接我们伟大的国庆十周年！
