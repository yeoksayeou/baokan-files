We listened to Premier Zhou's report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan with extreme excitement. We, as traditional opera workers, wholeheartedly support these reports. At the same time, we unanimously express our great indignation at the treacherous behavior of the traitorous elements who kidnapped the Dalai Lama and betrayed the motherland. The unification of the motherland is the supreme interest of all nationalities, and we will never allow anyone to undermine the unity of our great motherland.

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 greatly advanced our country's great socialist construction. We have personally witnessed this and experienced it in our own posts, so we feel particularly close and happy when listening to the reports. We deeply realize that only the leadership of the Party can lead to such brilliant achievements. After the Party put forward the general line for building socialism, a galloping leap forward situation immediately appeared in industrial and agricultural production. The speed of steel production increased so rapidly that it exceeded Britain's fifty years in just six years, and agricultural output was even more astonishing. In our literary and artistic work, since the rectification campaign against rightists, following the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, a new face has emerged. Traditional opera troupes have broken with conservatism and superstition, striving to make traditional opera serve production, politics, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers in a timely manner, and have performed many good plays that are welcomed by the broad masses. The troupes go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, bringing plays to workshops, construction sites, and remote mountain gullies, so that the working people can hear our singing and see our performances. When we went to the mountains to perform, we often heard many old men and women say, "I've lived for seventy or eighty years and never seen what a play is like. Now it's being brought to our doorstep! If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we wouldn't expect to have such days!" Yes, we actors also have to thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. By going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, our thoughts have been transformed, and our art has gained new life.

In factories, rural areas, and military units, we eat, live, and labor with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their selfless enthusiasm for building socialism and their proletarian ideological qualities deeply educate us. In particular, many leading comrades also work diligently and tirelessly with the masses in the posture of ordinary workers, which makes us even more moved. Thanks to these inspirations and labor exercises, our thinking has also been improved. In the past, we thought that the actor's honor was only due to his own talent, because we directly met the audience, and the audience's praise and praise were also directed at us, and we were deceived by this phenomenon. After going to the countryside and up the mountains, we not only participated in labor with the peasants; we also carried props and moved scenery ourselves during performances. Therefore, we know that the performance of a play includes the labor of many people, that is to say, the actor's honor is also the honor of the entire troupe, both on and off the stage. After we understood this point, we realized that we are just ordinary workers. Therefore, a new atmosphere of unprecedented unity has emerged in the relationship between the front and the back of our troupe.

Due to the frequent contact with the working people, their thoughts and feelings constantly infect us, and their heroic deeds of creating the world and their fearless spirit often urge us to better express them on the stage and learn from them in our work. With this motivation, our artistic creation has gained brilliance and a strong vitality. However, all of this is only the beginning of our transformation. In the future, we must continue to carry out self-transformation, continue to participate in physical labor regularly, gradually become workers and peasants, and better shape the image of the working people on the stage.

Under the illumination of the Party's general line, our traditional opera work has taken a big step, but compared with the leap forward in industry and agriculture, we are far behind. Our performances, whether in quantity or quality, still cannot meet the needs of the people's cultural life. Therefore, in 1959, on the basis of 1958, we must not only perform more, but also improve the quality. Therefore, we must improve our acting skills. Some comrades are afraid to talk about technology, fearing that they will commit the error of "purely technical viewpoint." Of course, a purely technical viewpoint is wrong, but if we master advanced technology, we can better perform dramas with advanced ideology and better serve politics. Advanced technology is achieved through diligent study and hard practice, so we must study diligently, especially learn from veteran artists. Of course, we must also tell young actors and amateur actors from workers and peasants about our experience, and we must also learn from the advantages of young actors and amateur actors, such as their boldness and courage. In short, we must learn until we are old and teach until we are old.

In addition, we were all born poor in the past, and we were deprived of the right to study in the old society. Therefore, our culture is relatively low. Since liberation, we have learned some culture under the sunshine of the Party, but in order to better study Marxism-Leninism and learn various knowledge, we must redouble our efforts to study culture to meet the needs of our work and become outstanding intellectuals of the working class.

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 plunged us into a galloping climax, which drove us forward and improved us. This time, listening to Premier Zhou's report has given us even greater encouragement and confidence. We, like traditional opera workers across the country, must work hard with greater confidence and energy to strive to overfulfill the 1959 plan. We firmly believe that with the great development of industry and agriculture in the motherland, the flowers of traditional opera will also emit more beautiful brilliance in the great garden of the motherland.

    戏曲艺术有了新的生命
    沈佩华　张士勤　丁果仙　丁是娥　韩俊卿  周惠侬　严凤英　尹　羲　苏育民　吴天保韩世昌委员的联合发言
    我们以万分激动的心情听完了周总理的报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告，我们戏曲工作者衷心地拥护这些报告。同时我们一致表示，对叛国分子劫持达赖喇嘛背叛祖国的可耻行为，表示极大愤慨。祖国统一是各民族最高的利益，我们决不允许任何人破坏我们伟大祖国的统一。
    一九五八年的大跃进，把我国伟大的社会主义建设大大向前推进。这都是我们亲身看到，并在自己的岗位上经历了的，所以听报告时感到特别亲切和高兴。我们深深体会到只有党的领导才能有这样辉煌的成就。党提出了建设社会主义的总路线以后，工农业生产马上出现了万马奔腾的跃进形势。钢增产的速度，六年的时间就超过英国的五十年，农业产量更是惊人，我们文艺工作方面，自整风反右以后，随着工农业的大跃进，也出现了新的面貌，戏曲剧团打破了保守、迷信，努力使戏曲及时地为生产服务，为政治服务，为工农兵服务，演出了很多为广大群众所欢迎的好戏。剧团上山下乡，把戏送到车间里，送到工地上，送到穷乡僻壤的山沟沟里，使劳动人民都能听到我们的歌唱，看到我们的表演。我们到山里去演唱的时候，经常听到很多老大爷、老大娘说：“我活了七八十年啦，也没见过戏是怎样的，这会竟然送到咱们家门口来啦，要不是共产党、毛主席，咱们那能指望有这种日子啊！”是的，我们演员也要感谢毛主席和共产党，通过上山下乡，使我们的思想得到改造，艺术有了新的生命。
    我们在工厂、农村、部队和工人、农民、战士们同吃、同住、同劳动，他们那种建设社会主义的忘我的劳动热情，和无产阶级的思想品质深深地教育了我们，特别是许多领导同志也都以一个普通劳动者的姿态和群众一起，勤勤恳恳，废寝忘餐地工作着，使我们更为感动。由于这些启发和劳动的锻炼，我们的思想也有所提高。过去，我们认为演员的荣誉只是由于自己的才能得到的，因为我们是直接和观众见面的，观众称赞表扬的，也是直接对着我们，我们就被这种现象所迷惑。经过下乡上山，我们不仅和农民一起参加劳动；演出时也自己抬道具，搬布景，因此我们知道一出戏的演出，是包括了许多人的劳动的，也就是说，演员的荣誉，同时是台前台后的全团的荣誉。我们理解这点之后，才更懂得我们也不过是个普通的劳动者，因此我们团内的台前台后关系出现了空前团结的新气象。
    由于和劳动人民的经常相处，他们的思想感情时时感染着我们，他们创造世界的英雄事迹和大无畏的精神常常促使着我们在舞台上更好地表现他们，在工作中学习他们，有了这种动力，才使我们的艺术创作有了光彩，有了较强的生命力。不过所有这些，都是我们改造的开始，今后还须继续不断地进行自我改造，要继续定期参加体力劳动，逐步做到工农化，在舞台上更好地塑造劳动人民的形象。
    我们戏曲工作在党的总路线的照耀下，虽然跨了一大步，但比起工农业的跃进来，我们是远远的落在后面的。我们的演出不管在数量上，质量上都还不能满足人民的文化生活的需要。因此，一九五九年要在一九五八年的基础上不仅要演出多，而且要提高质量。所以我们要提高演技。有些同志怕谈技术，怕犯“单纯技术观点”的错误。当然，单纯技术观点是不对的，但是，如果我们掌握了高度的技术，便能更好地表演有高度思想的戏剧，才能更好地为政治服务。高度的技术是通过勤学苦练得来的，所以我们要刻苦钻研，特别应该向老艺人学习。当然，我们也要把经验告诉年轻的演员和工农群众中的业余演员，我们也要向年轻演员和业余演员的大胆勇敢等优点学习。总之，我们要学到老、教到老。
    另外，我们过去都出身贫苦，在旧社会被剥夺了念书的权利，因此我们文化都较低。自从解放后，在党的阳光普照下我们才学了些文化，但是，为了更好的学习马列主义，学习各种知识，我们要加倍努力学习文化，以适应工作的需要，成为优秀的工人阶级知识分子。
    一九五八年的大跃进，把我们卷进万马奔腾的高潮里，把我们带动了，也提高了。这一次，我们听了周总理的报告，更给我们莫大的鼓舞和信心。我们和全国的戏曲工作者一样，一定要以更大的信心和干劲努力工作，为超额完成一九五九年的计划而奋斗。我们坚信，随着祖国工农业的大发展，戏曲的花朵也将在祖国的大花园中放出更美丽的光彩。
