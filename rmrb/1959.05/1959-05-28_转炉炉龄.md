    Converter Furnace Life

    Converter furnace life is the service life of a converter. The inner furnace wall of a converter is made of refractory bricks pressed from magnesia and dolomite mixed with coal tar pitch. This furnace wall is called the "lining." During blowing, the lining is gradually eroded by the scouring of molten steel and slag. After a certain number of heats, the furnace must be dismantled and relined. Therefore, the longer the furnace life, the higher the equipment utilization rate and the greater the steel output. If the furnace life is too short, the non-production time for dismantling and relining the furnace increases, the equipment utilization rate decreases, and the steel output also decreases.

    Extending the furnace life can not only increase steel production but also save refractory materials and manpower and materials for bricklaying and furnace lining, thus reducing production costs.

    The length of the furnace life is related to the quality of the iron charge, the temperature of the molten iron, the quality of the lining, and the operating skills of the furnace workers. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 adopts the operating method of "steelmaking and furnace maintenance": when a new furnace is put into use, the first ten heats are loaded with less molten iron, and then the furnace output is gradually increased. This is a method of protecting the furnace. Because when a new furnace is baked, the temperature is generally only 1200 degrees Celsius, and the lining is not yet sintered. Loading less molten iron for the first ten heats can achieve the purpose of sintering the lining while making steel. After ten heats, increasing the furnace output will reduce the degree of lining erosion and extend the life of the furnace. The operating methods of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6 also stipulate that the furnace rocking angle should not exceed 20 degrees, slag making should generally not exceed twice, and post-blowing should be reduced as much as possible and eliminated. These operating methods also have a great impact on the furnace life.

    Adopting reasonable operating methods can not only extend the furnace life and increase steel production but also improve steel quality. For example, too many slag-making operations not only lengthen the blowing time and cause severe lining erosion but also lower the temperature of the molten steel, affecting the quality of the steel.

    转炉炉龄
    转炉炉龄是转炉的使用期限。转炉内部炉壁是由镁砂、白云石拌和焦油沥青压制的耐火砖砌成的，这个炉壁叫做“炉衬”。炉衬在吹炼的时候，因为钢水和钢渣的冲刷而逐渐被侵蚀，吹炼到一定的炉数，就得拆炉、重新砌炉。因此，炉龄愈长，设备利用率愈高，钢产量也就提高；炉龄太短，拆炉、砌炉等非生产时间增加，设备利用率降低，钢产量也就降低。
    炉龄延长，不仅可以提高钢产量，还能节约耐火材料和节省打砖、砌炉等工作的人力、物力，降低生产成本。
    炉龄的长短，同铁料质量的好坏、铁水温度的高低、炉衬质量的好坏以及炉前工人操作技术等，都有关系。上钢六厂采取的是“炼钢又炼炉”的操作方法：在新炉开始使用的时候，前十炉少装铁水，以后逐渐扩大炉产量，这是一种保护炉子的操作方法。因为新炉子在烘炉的时候，温度一般只有摄氏一千二百度，炉衬还没有烧结好。头十炉少装铁水，就能达到一边炼钢，一边烧结炉衬的目的；十炉以后再扩大炉产量，炉衬的侵蚀程度就会减轻，炉子寿命就可以延长。上钢六厂的操作方法，还规定摇炉角度不超过二十度，造渣一般不超过两次，尽可能减少后吹和消灭后吹等等。这些操作方法，对炉龄也有很大的影响。
    采用合理的操作方法，不仅可以延长炉龄，提高钢的产量，也能改善钢的质量。例如，造渣次数过多，不但吹炼时间长，炉衬侵蚀严重，而且会降低钢水的温度，影响钢的质量。
