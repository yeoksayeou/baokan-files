Warning to the Thai Reactionaries
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Thai authorities' long-standing conspiracy to instigate the Lao reactionaries to tear up the Geneva Accords, launch a civil war, and try to drag Laos into the Manila military bloc has recently developed to an open and brazen stage.

As early as February 1955, Thailand sent a military delegation to Laos to incite the Lao Royal Army to attack the former Lao Patriotic Forces, and colluded with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek army wandering in the Lao-Thai border area, plotting to harass our Yunnan border. At that time, Thailand wanted to drag Laos into the Manila Group in fact; the Thai delegation declared at that time that the relationship between Thailand and Laos in common defense must be discussed.

Subsequent facts have proved that Thailand is increasingly becoming the most active accomplice of the United States in its aggression against the people of Indochina. Everyone knows that the failed Cambodian treason case three or four months ago was carried out with Thailand and South Vietnam as its source. Almost none of the major conspiracies carried out by the United States in Laos is not closely related to Thailand, and many are carried out through Thailand. For example, the United States violated the Geneva Accords and transported a large amount of weapons and ammunition into Laos, which was transported through Thailand. U.S. International Cooperation Administration personnel have long admitted this; the United States engaged in separatist activities in Lower Laos, attempting to split Lower Laos from Laos and turn it into an "independent country" or an appendage of Thailand. This unsuccessful conspiracy was carried out by Thai agents colluding with Katay Don Sasorith of Laos; when the United States wanted to exert economic pressure on the Phouma cabinet, which advocated peace and neutrality, Thailand imposed a "border blockade" on Laos, detaining transit materials. Thailand's activities to drag Laos into the Manila Group have received active response and cooperation from the Thai reactionaries. In January of this year, shortly before Sananikone announced the abandonment of the Geneva Accords, the Thai authorities called for the Manila Group to intervene in the Lao situation; in April of this year, Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman called on the Manila Group in Wellington to give Laos more military assistance, believing that after the Sananikone government unilaterally abandoned the Geneva Accords, Laos could "freely" accept foreign "aid". Thanat Khoman also believed that Laos' political system was "weak" and said that a "blueprint" should be drawn up for Laos. What kind of blueprint is it? After the Wellington Conference, the Thai authorities actively held talks with the pro-American reactionaries in Laos, and they did not hide their conspiracy to plan a military coup in Laos. Sure enough, on May 11, the Lao authorities ordered the disbandment of the two battalions of the former Lao Patriotic Forces incorporated into the Royal Army, and monitored and placed under house arrest the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party and the former Lao Patriotic Forces. On May 20, Lao Foreign Minister Phagna Pheng Norindr went to South Vietnam to discuss the establishment of a military alliance and the construction of strategic highways and military bases. During this period, Phagna Pheng Norindr announced that he would soon declare the Lao Patriotic Party illegal. After Phagna Pheng Norindr met with South Vietnam, Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman rushed to Laos on the 28th to meet with Phagna Pheng Norindr to put the final touches on the trilateral military alliance between Thailand, Laos, and South Vietnam. At this point, people can clearly see the truth of the so-called Thanat Khoman "blueprint", that is, to completely tear up the Geneva Accords and the democratic agreements within Laos, launch a civil war internally, undermine national unity, abandon the policy of peace and neutrality externally, and form a military alliance between Thailand, Laos, and South Vietnam, becoming a quasi-member of the Manila war group, thereby facilitating U.S. imperialism to further occupy the entire Indochina and threaten peace in Southeast Asia and the Far East.

People cannot but also notice that Thailand, Laos, and South Vietnam (as well as the traitorous Sang Saly of Cambodia) are making frequent contacts and activities in Lower Laos. The strategic highway spanning the Indochina Peninsula, connecting Thailand, Laos, and South Vietnam, is under construction, and the plan to establish a large-scale U.S. military base in Lower Laos is also being accelerated.

The rapid deterioration of the situation in Laos, the U.S. activities of organizing military alliances, establishing military bases, and preparing for new aggression in Indochina have not only seriously undermined peace in Indochina and threatened the security of Thailand, Laos, South Vietnam, and neighboring countries, but will also bring serious consequences to peace in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Therefore, the governments and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries have repeatedly issued warnings about this situation, demanding the immediate cessation of the criminal activities of the United States and its accomplices, the Thai and South Vietnamese authorities, and the restoration of normalcy to the situation. At the same time, we must also warn the Thai authorities that their actions of undermining the Geneva Accords, organizing the Thai-Lao-South Vietnamese military alliance, and willingly acting as accomplices and pawns of U.S. imperialism's aggressive plans will not bring them the slightest benefit. Those who play with fire will surely be burned. If they are obsessed with their ways and insist on this behavior that violates the interests of peace and independence of their own people, acts as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and opposes the people of Indochina and Asia, they will eventually be subjected to the relentless judgment of history.

    警告泰国反动派
    本报评论员
    泰国当局在美帝国主义指使之下，策动老挝反动派撕毁日内瓦协议发动内战、力图把老挝拉进马尼拉军事集团的由来已久的阴谋，最近已发展到明目张胆的地步了。
    还在1955年2月，泰国就派出军事代表团到老挝，策动老挝王国军队向前寮国战斗部队进攻，并且同在老、泰边境流窜的蒋军残部相勾结，阴谋骚扰我云南边境。泰国在当时就想在事实上把老挝拉进马尼拉集团；泰国代表团当时就曾宣称，必须对泰国和老挝在共同防御中的关系问题进行讨论。
    以后的事实证明，泰国日益变为美国侵略印度支那人民的最积极的帮凶。谁都知道，三四个月以前失败了的柬埔寨叛国案就是以泰国和南越为策源地进行的。美国在老挝进行的许多重大阴谋，几乎没有一件不是同泰国密切相关的，而且不少是假手泰国进行的。例如美国违反日内瓦协议，把大量武器弹药运进老挝，就是经过泰国运去的，美国国际合作署人员对此早已直认不讳；美国在下寮搞分裂活动，要把下寮从老挝分裂出去，变成一个“独立国”，或泰国的附属国，这一未遂的阴谋是泰国的特务勾结老挝的卡代进行的；当美国要在经济上给主张和平中立的富马内阁施加压力时，泰国便对老挝实行“边境封锁”，扣留过境物资不放。美国把老挝拉入马尼拉集团的活动，更是得到泰国反动当局的积极响应与配合。今年1月，当萨纳尼空宣布废弃日内瓦协议之前不久，泰国当局即叫出了要马尼拉集团干预老挝局势；今年4月，泰国外长科曼在惠灵顿号召马尼拉集团给予老挝更多的军事援助，认为在萨纳尼空政府片面废弃日内瓦协议以后，老挝已经可以“自由地”接受外国“援助”了。科曼还认为老挝的政治制度“软弱无力”，说要为老挝制订一张“蓝图”。到底是一张怎样的蓝图呢？泰国当局在惠灵顿会议之后，就积极同老挝的亲美反动派会谈，他们并不隐瞒他们策划老挝军事政变的阴谋。果然，5月11日，老挝当局下令解除前寮国战斗部队并入王国军队的两营武装，并且监视和软禁了老挝爱国党和前寮国战斗部队领导人员。5月20日老挝外交大臣班雅到南越商讨关于确立军事同盟，修建战略公路和军事基地问题。在此期间，班雅宣布，他即将宣布老挝爱国党为非法。在班雅与南越会谈后，接着泰国外长科曼于28日赶到老挝同班雅见面，为泰国、老挝、南越三边军事同盟作最后的润色。至此，人们已经可以清楚的看到了所谓科曼“蓝图”的真相，这就是，彻底撕毁日内瓦协议和老挝国内的民主协议，对内发动内战、破坏民族团结，对外放弃和平中立政策，使泰国、老挝和南越结成军事同盟，成为马尼拉战争集团的准成员国，从而便于美帝国主义进一步霸占整个印度支那，威胁东南亚和远东和平。
    人们也不能不注意到，泰国、老挝、南越（还有柬埔寨的叛国分子桑·萨里）正在下寮作频繁的接触和活动。横贯印度支那半岛的，联系泰、老、南越三国的战略公路正在修建，在下寮建立一个大型的美国军事基地的计划也正在加紧进行。
    老挝局势的急剧恶化，美国在印度支那组织军事同盟、建立军事基地和准备新侵略的活动，不但严重地破坏了印度支那的和平，威胁了泰、老、南越各邻国的安全，而且将给东南亚和远东和平带来严重恶果。因此，越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和其它爱好和平国家的政府和人民，对这一局势一再发出警告，要求迅速制止美国及其帮凶泰国和南越当局的罪恶活动，使局势恢复正常。同时，我们也必须警告泰国当局，他们这一破坏日内瓦协议，组织泰、老、南越军事同盟，甘心充当美帝国主义侵略计划的帮凶和走卒的行径，绝不会给他们自己带来丝毫好处。玩火者必将自焚，他们如果执迷不悟，坚持这种违反本国人民的和平、独立的利益，充当美帝国主义帮凶，与印度支那和亚洲人民为敌的行为，终将使他们受到历史的无情的裁判。
