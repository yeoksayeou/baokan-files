Comrades,

I completely agree with and warmly support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng. I am an agricultural machinery worker. Under the correct leadership of the Party, China's agricultural implement industry has achieved rapid development during the First Five-Year Plan period, especially in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Last year alone, the masses improved and created tens of thousands of kinds of agricultural implements, with more than 350 million pieces being manufactured and promoted; the vast rural areas have realized cartization and ball bearingization, thereby greatly improving labor productivity. At the same time, due to breaking superstitions and emancipating the mind, many agricultural implement innovators have emerged across the country; due to the better combination of agricultural technology personnel with workers and farmers, China's agricultural machinery industry has begun to embark on the road of independent creation. We are encouraged and immensely excited to see our cause flourishing and thriving. Now I would like to say a few words about the task of combine harvesters.

Combine harvesters are one of the 32 major industrial products in this year's national plan and also one of the so-called "six guarantees" products of the machinery industry. According to the draft national plan, this year's output will increase by 102% compared to last year. The unit I work in is one of the factories specifically implementing this plan and is also the main force this year. From our perspective, this plan is a greater leap forward than last year's plan and is also a reliable plan that can be completed. Numerically, it may not seem that large. However, we understand that the entire year's task must be basically completed before the end of July, otherwise it will not catch up with this year's wheat harvest season and therefore cannot play a role in this year's agricultural production. Furthermore, the combine harvester we are producing this year is a relatively complex agricultural implement, much more complex than a double-wheeled double-shared plow. Each machine has more than 2,000 kinds of parts and more than 10,000 components, requiring more than 220 kinds of materials. Therefore, the production cycle is long, and the management and organization of production are relatively complex, which increases the difficulty of this task. Taking the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory as an example, the planned task for the second quarter is even more than what was completed in the entire last year. However, all the factory's employees deeply recognize the great significance of this task and believe that having the opportunity to undertake this task is a great honor. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party Committee, all the employees, adopting the method of combining leaders, technical personnel, and workers, rapidly implemented 375 technical measures in about a month around March, thereby ensuring the completion of the estimated plan for the first quarter, and since the first day of April, they have basically been able to assemble finished products evenly on a daily basis. Before I came to the meeting, the comrades of the employees repeatedly instructed me to say: "You go and tell our farmer brothers, tell the representatives of the whole country, we will definitely guarantee to complete the task of combine harvesters on time, in quantity, and with quality, not a single one less."

While completing the national plan, in order to adapt to the annually increasing unit area yield, this year we have also designed and trial-produced two new types of combine harvesters that can adapt to higher yields, so that next year we can supply farmer brothers with better, easier to use, and cheaper machines.

Finally, I would like to offer a personal opinion on the issue of agricultural machinery manufacturing and supply. We know that the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agriculture in our country will mainly rely on the mass-based large-scale improvement of agricultural implements this year and in the next few years. However, the number of modern agricultural machinery will also increase correspondingly year by year. However, agricultural machinery is a seasonal piece of equipment, especially harvesting machinery. For example, combine harvesters, if used in a fixed area, are only used for about half a month each year. Even if the state organizes professional harvesting teams to harvest from south to north, from south of the Yangtze River to the banks of the Heilongjiang River, it will only be used for about five months each year. Therefore, if production is balanced throughout the year, a large part of the production will inevitably be idle for half a year before it can be put into production. For example, those produced after August will not be used until April of the following year. This will inevitably tie up funds, occupy materials urgently needed by other departments, and increase storage space and storage costs. From this point of view, if production is balanced throughout the year, the cost is lower, which is worthwhile in the long run; but at present, when our country's construction funds are not yet abundant and raw materials are still very tight, it is necessary and more worthwhile to organize seasonal production, like this year's combine harvesters. However, in order to be able to manufacture and supply more, faster, better, and more economically, and to meet the needs in terms of supply quantity as much as possible, for some relatively precise and complex products, which are currently difficult for local areas and people's communes to manufacture, whether we can select some main forces from the existing agricultural implement factories with better foundations and certain conditions, and enrich and cultivate them, so as to manufacture several different products according to seasonal needs. For example, if the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory is enriched and cultivated, it can manufacture combine harvesters in the first half of the year and produce rural power machinery or tractor-like products in the second half of the year, because many parts of these products are interchangeable, and the equipment required for manufacturing is also interchangeable.

Comrades, during this conference, the upper-class Tibetan rebels who fled to India fabricated a so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" on April 18. After reading this statement, I felt extremely angry. Tibet is our country's territory, and quelling the rebellion in Tibet is our country's internal affair. Anyone who wants to interfere will definitely be made to suffer a bloody nose. I am determined to implement the spirit and resolutions of this conference well, turn anger into strength, and contribute all my strength to building a peaceful and happy new Tibet with greater, better, and more comprehensive leap-forward achievements; let the imperialists and Indian expansionists give up their black hearts to split our country!

### 联合收割机的生产一定能够加番  李克佐代表的发言

　　联合收割机的生产一定能够加番
    李克佐代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并热烈拥护周总理、李富春、李先念副总理、和彭副委员长的报告。我是一个农业机械工作者。我国的农具事业，在党的正确领导下，在第一个五年计划期间，特别是大跃进的一九五八年，获得了飞跃的发展。仅仅去年一年，群众改良创造的农具就上万种，制造推广的有三亿五千多万件；广大农村实现了车子化和滚珠轴承化。从而大大提高了劳动生产率。同时由于破除迷信，解放思想，全国涌现出来了很多农具革新家；由于农具技术人员更好地和工人农民结合，使我国的农业机械事业开始走上了独立创造的道路。我们看着我们的事业欣欣向荣、蓬蓬勃勃的发展，感到欢欣鼓舞，无比的兴奋。现在我仅就联合收割机的任务说几句话。
    联合收割机是今年国家计划中三十二种主要工业产品之一，也是机械工业的所谓“六保”产品之一。按照国家计划草案，今年的产量比去年提高百分之一百零二。我所在的单位是具体执行这项计划的工厂之一，也是今年的主要力量。从我们这个角度看，这个计划是比去年更大跃进的计划，也是个可靠的、能够完成的计划。从数字上看，好像不太大。但是我们体会：全年任务基本上必须在七月底以前完成才行，否则就赶不上今年的麦收季节，因而就不能在今年的农业生产中发挥作用了。又加上今年我们生产的联合收割机是一种比较复杂的农具，比双轮双铧犁复杂多了。每部机器有两千多种、一万多个零件，要用二百二十多种材料。因此生产周期较长，管理和组织生产比较复杂，这就增加了这一任务的艰巨性。就以北京农业机械厂为例，第二季度的计划任务，比去年全年完成的还多。但是厂的全体职工都深刻认识到这项任务的重大意义，都认为有机会承担这项任务是莫大的光荣。所以全体职工在党委的领导下，采用领导、技术人员和工人三结合的方式，在三月份前后一个月的时间内，迅速实现了三百七十五项技术措施，从而保证了第一季度预计计划的完成，并且从四月份第一天起，就基本上能够按日均衡地装出成品。当我来开会以前，职工同志们再三嘱咐我说：“你去告诉咱们的农民弟兄们，告诉全国的代表们，我们一定保证按时、按量、按质地完成联合收割机的任务，一部也不会少。”
    在完成国家计划的同时，为了适应逐年提高的单位面积产量，今年我们还设计试制了两种新型的能够适应较高产量的联合收割机，以便明年能供应农民弟兄们更好使、更便宜的机器。
    最后，我想就农业机械的制造供应问题，提一点个人的意见。我们知道：我国农业实行机械化和半机械化，在今年和最近几年内，主要还是靠群众性的大规模的改良农具。但是现代化农业机械的数量也会相应地一年比一年增大。可是农业机械是一种有季节性的装备，特别是收获机械。例如联合收割机，如果在固定地区使用，每年不过用半个月左右。即使由国家组织专业收割队，从南往北收割，从长江以南收割到黑龙江畔，每年也不过使用五个月左右。因此，如果长年均衡生产，势必有很大一部分生产出来以后，要闲置半年才能投入生产。例如八月份以后生产的就要到第二年四月才能用上。这就不可避免地要积压资金，占用其它部门急需的材料，并且加大了储备场所和保管费用。由此看来，如果全年均衡生产，成本较低，从长远说是合算的；但是在目前我国建设资金还不充裕，原材料还很紧张的情况下，像今年的联合收割机一样，组织季节性的生产是必要的，比较合算的。但是为了既能在制造供应上多、快、好、省，又能在供应数量上尽量满足需要，有些比较精密复杂的产品，而地方和人民公社制造目前又有困难的，是否可在现有基础较好的、已经具备了一定条件的农具厂中，选择一些主力，加以充实培养，以便按季节需要分季制造数种不同的产品。例如，北京农业机械厂，如果加以充实培养，就可以在上半年制造联合收割机，下半年生产农村动力机械或拖拉机之类的产品，因为这些产品有很多零部件是可以通用的，制造上所需要的设备也是可以通用的。
    各位代表，在这次大会期间，逃到印度去的西藏上层叛乱分子于四月十八日制造了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。看了这个声明，我感到无比的愤怒。西藏是我国的领土，平定西藏的叛乱是我国的内政，任何人要想横加干涉，就一定叫他碰得头破血流。我决心把这次大会的精神和决议很好地回去贯彻，把愤怒化为力量，用更大、更好、更全面的跃进成就，为建设和平幸福的新西藏贡献出一切力量；让帝国主义和印度扩张主义者企图分裂我国的这条黑心死了吧！
