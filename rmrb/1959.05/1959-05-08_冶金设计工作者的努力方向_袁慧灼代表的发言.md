　　The Direction of Efforts for Metallurgical Design Workers
    Speech by Representative Yuan Huizhuo

    After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, regarding the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the plan and budget for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959, I feel extremely excited and express my complete agreement and support.
    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our people have already achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction during the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. Furthermore, due to the victory on the political and ideological front of the anti-Rightist rectification campaign, in 1958, under the radiant light of the Party's general line for building socialism, our people realized the communization of the rural areas nationwide and saw a Great Leap Forward situation that surpassed all historical records of production increase. The plan for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959, with steel, coal, grain, and cotton as the four major indicators, is roughly equivalent to three times the actual output in 1957. This is a very grand plan, and also a very arduous plan. I firmly believe that the people of all nationalities in our country, closely united under the leadership of the Party, will go all out, aim high, and be able to overcome all difficulties in their work. With the active action of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan, they will respond to Premier Zhou's call and happily welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great motherland.
    As a metallurgical design worker, I would like to talk about my understanding and direction of efforts based on what I have encountered in my work and life.
    (1) Our metallurgical design and survey workers have been able to become a young and powerful team because of the Party's cultivation, support, and ideological education. Especially in 1958, after the rectification movement against conservatism and waste, our minds were liberated, superstitions were eliminated, and a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act was initially established. This enabled us to cooperate with the situation of the Great Leap Forward nationwide and create the achievement of "saving half of the investment, speeding up several times, and one person doing the work of three." Of course, there were also some shortcomings in the middle regarding the lack of comprehensive implementation of more, faster, better, and more economical results. However, this is only a ratio of nine fingers to one finger. In terms of saving a large amount of investment for the country and fundamentally reversing the passive situation of construction waiting for design and design waiting for surveying, the achievements are the main ones and also significant. In 1959, we must continue to oppose conservatism, liberate our minds, and, based on the spirit of soaring drive combined with scientific analysis, as well as the principle of walking on two legs, we will definitely be able to complete the design and survey tasks for the continued leap forward of construction in 1959 and beyond on time, in quantity, and with quality.
    (2) In order to cooperate with the continued Great Leap Forward with steel as the key, we must also do a good job in the design of mining, beneficiation, and smelting projects for alloy steel raw materials such as nickel, cobalt, vanadium, barium, and tungsten, important non-ferrous metal raw materials such as copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, and tin and their comprehensive utilization of by-products, as well as various rare metal projects that supply raw materials needed for cutting-edge science and technology, in addition to steel production itself. We must pay attention to cultivating strength, accumulating experience, strengthening the study of Soviet science and technology, improving our design thinking and business technology level, and expanding the scope of design product varieties.
    (3) We must also carry out mass movements on a large scale. In design work, putting politics in command ideologically will enable us to better utilize the wisdom of the masses and tap the potential in design. We must also do a good job in all aspects of collaboration and implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy in design work. Regarding the policy of large, medium, and small enterprises developing simultaneously, and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, we should currently focus on giving play to the characteristics of small and medium-sized enterprises that can start production early, and do a good job in the design of combining indigenous and foreign methods to improve the metal recovery rate of "indigenous" and "small" enterprises, save fuel and labor, and reduce costs. This will make "indigenous" and "small" mining and metallurgical enterprises more suitable for blooming everywhere, thereby mobilizing the production potential of all parts of the country, especially remote areas, and promoting the overall acceleration of the entire production and construction process.
    (4) Our designers enthusiastically respond to the arrangement of participating in production labor and physical labor for a certain amount of time each year. Because we realize that only by participating in physical labor can we effectively help us overcome shortcomings in our work style and thinking. Only by eating, living, and working with the workers and peasants can we help us establish and consolidate the feeling of sharing the same breath with the workers and peasants, and truly transform ourselves into intellectuals of the working class; it is also the best way to correct the disconnection between theory and practice, and therefore it will inevitably improve our design business and technical level.
    (5) Recently, the suppression of the rebellion by the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata has been pacified, and I deeply congratulate the Tibetan compatriots in Tibet. Because the stumbling block that hindered the autonomous development of Tibet, hindered the social reform of Tibet, and hindered the Great Leap Forward of production and construction in Tibet, has been kicked away, the Tibetan compatriots can obtain real liberation, and soon set off a climax of developing rich water resources and mineral resources to engage in the socialist construction of the motherland, and build the Tibetan plateau into a paradise on earth. I am willing to contribute a share of strength in the design and survey position, together with Tibetan compatriots.
    Finally, I express my indignation at the behavior of Indian expansionists, who have forgotten that India itself was once invaded by British imperialism, and instead want to inherit the legacy of British imperialism, and vainly attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine the friendship between China and India. We will never allow them to wantonly carry out rampant provocations!

　　冶金设计工作者的努力方向
    袁慧灼代表的发言
    我听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，以及李富春和李先念两位副总理，彭真副委员长的三个报告，对一九五八年的大跃进成绩和一九五九年继续大跃进的计划和预算，感到非常欣奋，表示完全同意和拥护。
    我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，已经在第一个五年计划执行中，获得在社会主义革命方面和社会主义建设方面，辉煌的成就。更由于反右整风政治思想战线的胜利，一九五八年我国人民在党的建设社会主义总路线光芒照耀下，实现了全国农村的人民公社化，出现了超出历史上增产速率纪录的大跃进局面。一九五九年继续大跃进的计划，以钢、煤、粮、棉为纲的四大指标，约相当一九五七年实际产量的三倍。这是非常宏伟的计划，也是非常艰巨的计划。我深信我国各族人民，紧密团结在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定能克服一切工作中的困难，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，响应周总理的号召，愉快地迎接伟大祖国建立的十周年纪念。
    作为一个冶金设计工作者，我愿就工作生活所接触到的，谈谈自己的领会，和努力的方向。
    （1）我们冶金设计勘察工作者，一直在党的培养扶植和思想教育下，才能成为一支年轻强大的队伍。特别在一九五八年经过了反保守、反浪费的整风运动，解放了思想，破除了迷信，初步树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，才能配合全国大跃进的形势，创造了“投资省一半，速度快几番，人力一顶三”的成绩。当然中间亦有一些对多快好省，不够全面贯彻的缺点。这不过是九个指头对一个指头的比数。对国家节约大量投资，和基上本扭转以往施工等设计，设计等勘察的被动局面来说，成绩是主要的亦是显著的。一九五九年仍当继续反对保守，解放思想，本着冲天干劲结合科学分析精神，以及两条腿走路方针，一定能按时，按量，按质地完成一九五九年及今后建设继续跃进的设计勘察任务。
    （2）为了配合以钢为纲的继续大跃进，我们一定还要做好，除了钢铁生产本身以外，合金钢原料的镍、钴、钒、钡、钨等项目，重要有色金属原料的铜、铝、铅、锌、锡等及其副产品综合利用的项目，以及供应尖端科学技术上需用原料的各种稀有金属项目，各项采矿、选矿、冶炼的设计。我们必须注意培养力量，累积经验，加强对苏联科学技术的学习，提高我们的设计思想和业务技术水平，扩大设计产品品种的范围。
    （3）我们还必须大搞群众运动。要在设计工作思想上政治挂帅，就能更好发挥群众智慧，挖掘设计中的潜力。我们还必须做好各方面的协作，在设计工作中，贯彻增产节约的精神。对大中小并举，和土洋并举的方针上，目前更当着力于发挥中小企业能提早生产的特点，做好土洋结合的设计，来提高“土”“小”企业的金属回收率，节约燃料和劳动力，减轻成本。使得“土”“小”的矿冶企业，更适于遍地开花，从而能动员全国各地，特别是偏僻地区的生产潜力，促进整个生产建设全面加速的发展过程。
    （4）我们设计人员，热烈地响应每年有一定时间下放参加生产劳动、体力劳动的安排。因为我们意识到，只有参加体力劳动，才能切实帮助我们克服工作作风和思想上的缺点。只有与工农群众同吃同住同劳动中，才能帮助我们树立和巩固与工农群众共呼吸的感情，把自己真确地改造成为工人阶级的知识分子；而且也是纠正理论与实际脱节的最好方法，因此必然也会提高我们的设计业务和技术水平。
    （5）最近原西藏地方政府与上层反动集团叛变的被平息，我深切地为西藏藏族同胞庆贺。因为妨碍西藏自治发展，妨碍西藏社会改革，妨碍西藏生产建设大跃进的绊脚石，既已一脚踢开，西藏同胞可获得切实解放，不久掀起开发丰富的水力资源和矿产资源从事祖国社会主义建设的高潮，把西藏高原建设为人间乐园。我愿在设计勘察岗位上，与藏族同胞一起，贡献一份力量。
    最后我对印度扩张主义分子，忘记了印度自己曾受英帝国主义的侵略，转想承继英帝国主义遗产，妄想干涉中国的内政，破坏中印两国的友谊的行为表示愤慨，我们是决不能允许他们任意猖狂挑衅的！
