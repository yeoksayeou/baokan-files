The friendship between Albania and its brother, the People's Republic of China, stretches across vast distances, but this has not prevented the Albanian people from better understanding the Chinese people, feeling as close as family to our Chinese brothers, and establishing a precious and eternal friendship between us. Nothing can hinder the close, solid friendly relations and fraternal sincere cooperation between the Chinese people, who have seized power under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party.

The foundation of our two countries' friendship is our shared ideology, the Marxist-Leninist thought that the Chinese Communist Party and the Albanian Labor Party faithfully follow in all their work. The Chinese and Albanian people labor and struggle for common goals. Their path is consistent, the path of socialism and communism. They are both active members of the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The people of our two countries struggle to defend the achievements of socialism and to defend peace against war. Our unbreakable unity is due to our shared experience of a great era filled with the struggle for freedom and independence, and therefore the friendship between our two countries is as solid as a rock, constantly strengthening and developing.

On November 29, 1944, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Party, achieved a historic victory. Our liberator and protector, our great common friend, the Soviet Union, gave us tremendous help. We drove out the foreign occupiers, overthrew the old ruling class, and joined the socialist family. Thus, the Albanian people no longer feel isolated and helpless; on the contrary, they clearly see that the era in which imperialists manipulated the fate of the Albanian people is gone forever. Today, the Albanian people not only hold power themselves, but also have great, loyal friends who wholeheartedly cherish and help them. When someone asks an ordinary Albanian farmer, "How many people do you have?", he will immediately answer: Albania is big, Albania is a member of the socialist camp family, we have a total of 950 million people, we have formed an eternal friendship with our liberator and protector – the great Soviet Union, 650 million Chinese people are our friends, and the people of all socialist countries are our friends. It is easy to understand why an ordinary farmer clearly understands this great truth. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We share our destiny and breathe the same air with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp." This friendship has brought new strength to our people, enabling the Albanian people to selflessly build a socialist motherland and deliver a well-deserved blow to enemies at home and abroad, especially the American imperialists and their running dogs, the lackeys of the "US aid" masters, the Belgrade group headed by Tito. This friendship is also the foundation of the victories that our people have achieved in the past and will continue to achieve in the future under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, we must cherish it as we cherish our most precious possessions.

All the relations between our country and people and the People's Republic of China and the brotherly Chinese people are based on this foundation of friendship. The economic and cultural mutual assistance between our two countries is a noble example of proletarian internationalism. The starting point of these relations is to support each other, learn from each other's work experience, further improve the economic and cultural living standards of our people, and build socialism faster. The relations between our two countries, like the relations between all socialist countries, have nothing in common with the "big fish eat small fish" relations between capitalist countries. Our loyal friendship and fraternal mutual cooperation guarantee the freedom and independence of the People's Republic of Albania and make it increasingly prosperous. The People's Republic of Albania has always received selfless assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries in all aspects. The assistance that the Chinese people have provided in the past and present to help the Albanian people realize the first and second five-year plans is extremely valuable. The Albanian people deeply thank the fraternal Chinese people for their unstinting help in building our motherland. Albania, once a backward country in Europe, has today become an advanced agricultural and industrial country, developing its economy, culture, and education at a high speed, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly prosperous. The total industrial output in 1958 increased seventeenfold compared to 1938. In the past, Albania needed to import many industrial products from abroad, but now it can be supplied by the new industries established with the selfless help of the Soviet Union. In 1957, per capita, Albania's output of textiles, sugar, chromium ore, iron ore, nickel, and copper all exceeded those of our neighboring countries Yugoslavia, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. In the fifteen years of the people's regime, the speed of industrial development in our country would have taken at least one hundred and twenty-nine years to achieve under the past reactionary regime. The total investment in economic and cultural development in 1958 was sixty-nine times that of 1950. With the development of industry, our agriculture and socialist transformation of the countryside have also developed accordingly. Thanks to the various measures taken by the people's regime, such as building water conservancy projects and turning swamps into fertile fields, our cultivated land area has expanded by 72% compared to before the war. The grain output in 1958 also increased by 125% compared to before the war. Agriculture is now increasingly mechanized. In the past, our farmers had never seen tractors, but today we have 3,000 tractors (each calculated at fifteen horsepower). The area of cooperatives accounts for 76.2% of the country's cultivated land. The farmers are firmly and enthusiastically advancing along the path of collectivization, which is the path pointed out by the Party. Farmers are building a new socialist countryside.

Under the constant care of the Party and the people's regime, our education and culture are also developing rapidly. The total number of schools in our country is now four and a half times greater than before the war, and the number of students has also increased four and a half times. Last year alone, the number of graduates from various colleges and universities was equivalent to the total number of cadres with higher qualifications under the reactionary regime. Today, on average, one in six people in Albania attends school. Illiteracy was eliminated in 1955, which was a huge scar left over from the old society. With the development of education, culture and art have also flourished accordingly. Many cities now have art troupes such as opera, drama, ballet, music, and acrobatics. Libraries, reading rooms, and cultural palaces built under the people's regime all serve the working people. Medical care is free. Everything the people's regime does is to achieve the lofty goal set by the Party of continuously improving and raising the material and cultural living standards of the people.

All this is the crystallization of fraternal relations and friendship between socialist countries. All the progress of the backward, oppressed, and exploited old Albania is a clear example. Today, Albania is advancing along the path of socialism, it is a member of the socialist family, its freedom and independence are guaranteed, and it receives selfless help and support from the Soviet Union. We are building our future and increasingly better life. The Belgrade revisionist group, which has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and the interests of the people and serves American imperialism, is unwilling to see this truth. They viciously slander the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries. They insist that the Soviet Union, the most reliable friend of human freedom and independence and the defender of peace, is dominating other countries. They say that the relations between socialist countries are those of big countries dominating small countries, and that the assistance the Soviet Union gives to other countries and the mutual assistance between socialist countries is a loss of independence. They even compare the powerful peaceful socialist camp with the war blocs that imperialist countries have established to push the world into a more brutal war. Their aim is to try to undermine our unity and our eternal friendship. This is no different from the imperialists' intention to undermine our unity and then defeat us one by one. Despite the various tricks played by the Yugoslav revisionist group to turn white into black, despite their vicious slander of socialist countries, their support of Tibetan rebels, their use of Dulles' language to slander the People's Republic of China and its great leader, and their various conspiracies against the People's Republic of Albania, they will never achieve their goals, just like their masters – the American imperialists who give Yugoslavia a lot of dollars. For forty years, imperialism has been attacking the great Soviet state like a mad dog. They have exhausted all means and constantly spread rumors and slanders, but each time they have ended in failure. Imperialism, especially American imperialism, is howling like a wild beast against the fraternal People's Republic of China and against little Albania, and their loyal running dogs, the Belgrade revisionists, have completely colluded with them. But as our proverb says:
"The more a dog barks, the less it bites." This is exactly how the imperialists are. They shout madly, but dare not touch us, because they know who they are dealing with. If they dare to attack us, it is tantamount to digging their own graves, because we are not isolated. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is united and incomparably powerful. And they, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, are a paper tiger. The Korean War, the Suez Canal incident, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots, and the Tibetan rebellion were all launched under the direct organization of imperialism, but they all failed. This is the fate of all those who dare to infringe upon the interests of our people.

The Albanian people are very pleased to see the great achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in the ten years of the people's regime. The Albanian people regard these achievements as their own. They further strengthen the economic and defense power of the People's Republic of China and are also the foundation for the fraternal Chinese people to stride forward on the road to socialism and communism. These achievements further consolidate the socialist camp.

The Albanian Labor Party delegation had the opportunity to see with their own eyes the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. China has become a large-scale construction site. While Chinese industry is developing by leaps and bounds, agriculture is also developing greatly, the people's cultural level is constantly improving, and the people's lives are improving day by day. We are very happy that our Party gave us such a good opportunity to personally see the fraternal People's Republic of China – the new China. We were deeply impressed by the warm, heartfelt, and cordial reception we received from the leaders to the workers in various factories and the members of the people's communes. Everywhere we went, we saw people with smiling faces and eyes shining with light, because they knew they were going to meet Albanian friends. Everywhere we felt at home, and people prepared very good conditions for us everywhere, which not only gave us the opportunity to meet many friends and express our friendship, but also enabled us to learn from them better, learn about their lives, their achievements, and their experiences, and understand their difficulties. We worked with them as brothers and friends in cities, enterprises, and people's communes. We learned a lot of work experience in China, especially the experience of leading agriculture. We felt infinite excitement when we saw the creative way in which the Chinese masses applied the Party's policies in practice. We saw that the general staff, in terms of heavy industry and light industry, correctly understood and implemented the policy of walking on two legs, and used everything that could be used, including indigenous methods, to build a modern industry and increase production. We saw the "ants gnawing at bones" method, where workers used simple machine tools made of small pieces of iron to produce large-scale machines. Ordinary commune members explained the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture to us, and we learned a lot from it. We also saw how they implemented this "Charter." The work enthusiasm of the commune members, their confidence in the future, and the economic achievements they have achieved in a short period of time all prove that the people's commune, pioneered by the Marxist-Leninist Chinese Communist Party, is the best form for China to build socialism and communism. The line of the people's commune is correct.

The May Day parade in Beijing left a deep impression on the members of our delegation. It showed the iron-like unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. It was an expression of the Chinese people's friendship and love for the Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries, and it was also an expression of the Chinese people's noble internationalist spirit.

Everything we have seen has convinced us that the Chinese people, with their skillful hands and wisdom, as well as their simplicity and purity of heart, are confidently and striding forward along the road of socialism and communism under the leadership of the Party.

We are about to leave China with unforgettable impressions. We will bring back to our country the valuable experience we have learned in China, the feelings of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party for the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party. For our Labor Party and our people, there is nothing more precious than the friendship built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist thought. Therefore, our Party and our people must cherish and develop the friendship with the great Soviet Union and the great Soviet Communist Party established by Lenin, with the fraternal People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, and with other socialist countries, and with all fraternal communist and labor parties in the world, as we protect our own eyes.

Our Party, which is forever loyal to Marxism-Leninism, is unwavering in its resolute struggle against all enemies who attempt to undermine our unity and weaken our friendship, especially the Belgrade revisionist group, which uses every means to undermine our relations and friendship.

Our people and the people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, and the people of other socialist countries are as closely united and friendly as one family. We will always advance together with them. The hearts of the Chinese and Albanian people beat together, our thoughts and goals are completely consistent, and the ideals that inspire us to move forward are also common. Therefore, our friendship is constantly consolidating and developing, and our friendship will last forever!

    中阿人民的友谊万古长青
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会书记  希斯尼·卡博
    阿尔巴尼亚和兄弟的中华人民共和国相隔万里，但是这并没有阻碍阿尔巴尼亚人民更好地了解中国人民，和兄弟的中国人民亲如一家，并在我们之间建立起宝贵的永恒的友谊。没有任何东西能够阻碍已经掌握政权的、在中国共产党领导下的中国人民和在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民之间建立起密切的、巩固的友好关系和兄弟般的真诚合作。
    我们两国友谊的基础是我们共同的意识形态，即中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在一切工作中忠实遵循的马克思列宁主义思想。中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民为共同的目标劳动和斗争。他们的道路是一致的，是社会主义和共产主义的道路。他们都是以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营中积极的一员。我们两国人民为保卫社会主义的成果，为保卫和平反对战争而斗争。我们之所以团结无间，是由于我们共同经历了充满着为自由独立而斗争的伟大时代，因而我们两国的友谊坚如磐石，日益巩固和日趋发展。
    1944年11月29日，阿尔巴尼亚人民在党的领导下获得了历史性的胜利，我们的解放者和保护者、我们共同的伟大朋友苏联给了我们巨大的帮助。我们赶走了外国占领者，推翻了旧的统治阶级并加入了社会主义国家的大家庭。因而阿尔巴尼亚人民不再感到孤立无援，相反地，它清楚地看到帝国主义者玩弄阿尔巴尼亚人民命运的时代已经一去不复返了。今天的阿尔巴尼亚人民，不但自己掌握了政权，而且有伟大的忠实的全心全意爱护和帮助他们的朋友。当有人问一个普通的阿尔巴尼亚农民说“你们有多少人口”的时候，他马上会回答：阿尔巴尼亚很大，阿尔巴尼亚是社会主义阵营大家庭的一员，我们共有九亿五千万人口，我们同我们的解放者和保护者——伟大的苏联结成了永恒的友谊，六亿五千万中国人民是我们的朋友，社会主义各国的人民也都是我们的朋友。一个普通农民都清楚地懂得这个伟大的真理，这是很容易理解的。毛泽东同志说过：“我们同苏联和整个社会主义阵营共命运，同呼吸。”这种友谊给我国人民带来了新的力量，它使阿尔巴尼亚人民忘我地建设社会主义的祖国，并给国内外敌人，特别是美帝国主义和他们的走狗、“美援”主人的奴才、以铁托为首的贝尔格莱德集团以应有的打击。这一友谊也是我们人民在党的领导下，过去和今后取得胜利的基础，因此，我们要像爱护最珍贵的东西一样爱护它。
    我们的国家和人民跟中华人民共和国和兄弟的中国人民的一切关系都是建立在这样的友谊基础上的。我们两国之间的经济和文化的互助关系是无产阶级国际主义精神的崇高榜样，这些关系的出发点是互相支援，互相学习工作经验，进一步提高我们人民的经济和文化生活水平，更快地建成社会主义。我们两国的关系，像一切社会主义国家之间的关系一样，和资本主义国家之间“大鱼吃小鱼”的关系毫无相同之处。我们之间忠实的友谊，兄弟般互助合作的关系，使阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国有了自由和独立的保证，并且日益繁荣。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一直从苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家得到各方面无私的帮助。中国人民过去和现在，为帮助阿尔巴尼亚人民实现第一个和第二个五年计划所提供的帮助是极为宝贵的。阿尔巴尼亚人民深切地感谢兄弟般的中国人民，因为他们毫不吝惜地帮助我们建设祖国。阿尔巴尼亚过去是欧洲一个落后的国家，今天已成为一个先进的农业工业国，它正在高速度地发展经济、文化和教育，人民的生活日益繁荣。1958年的工业总产量和1938年相比增加了十七倍。过去阿尔巴尼亚需要从外国进口很多工业品，现在则可以由那些在苏联无私帮助下建立起来的新工业来提供了。1957年，按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚的纺织品、糖、铬矿、铁矿、镍和铜的产量都超过我们的邻国南斯拉夫、意大利、希腊和土耳其。在人民政权的十五年内，我国工业发展的速度，在过去反动政权时代至少也要一百二十九年才能达到。1958年在发展经济和文化方面的投资总数相当于1950年的六十九倍。随着工业的发展，我国农业和农村社会主义改造也有着相应的发展。由于人民政权采取了多方面的措施，例如兴修水利，把沼泽变成良田，我国的耕地面积和战前相比扩大了72％。1958年的粮食产量也比战前增加了125％。现在农业正在日益走向机械化，过去我国农民根本没有见过拖拉机，今天我们已有三千台拖拉机
  （每台以十五马力计算），合作化的面积占全国耕地的76.2％。农民坚定不移地热情地沿着集体化的道路前进，这是党指明的道路。农民正在建设社会主义的新农村。
    在党和人民政权的不断关怀下，我国的教育和文化也日益发展。现在我国所有的学校总数比战前增加了四倍半，学生人数也增加了四倍半。仅在去年，各高等学校毕业的学生，就相等于反动政权下具有高等水平的全体干部的总和。今天阿尔巴尼亚平均每六个人有一个人上学，1955年扫除了文盲，这是旧社会遗留下来的一个巨大的创伤。随着教育的发展，文化和艺术也相应繁荣起来了，不少城市已拥有歌剧、话剧、芭蕾舞、音乐和杂技等艺术团体。在人民政权下建成的图书馆、阅览室和文化宫等都是为劳动人民服务的。医疗已免费。人民政权所做的一切都是为了达到党指定的不断改善和提高人民的物质文化生活水平这一崇高的目标。
    这一切都是社会主义国家之间兄弟般的关系和友谊的结晶，落后的、遭受压迫和剥削的旧阿尔巴尼亚的一切进步本身就是一个明显的例子。今天阿尔巴尼亚正沿着社会主义的道路迈进，它是社会主义大家庭的一员，它的自由和独立有了保证，它得到了苏联无私的帮助和支援。我们正在建设自己未来的日益美好的生活。叛变了马克思列宁主义和人民利益并为美帝国主义服务的贝尔格莱德修正主义集团，却不愿看到这一真理，他们恶毒地诬蔑苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家，他们硬说人类自由和独立的最可靠的朋友、和平的保卫者苏联在支配其他国家，社会主义国家之间的关系是大国支配小国，并且说苏联给予其他国家的帮助以及社会主义国家之间的互助是丧失独立，而且还把强大的和平社会主义阵营同帝国主义国家为了把世界推向更残酷的战争而建立的战争集团相提并论。他们的目的是企图要破坏我们的团结和我们永恒的友谊。这和帝国主义想破坏我们的团结然后各个击破的意图没有什么不同。尽管南斯拉夫修正主义集团施展种种伎俩把白的说成黑的，尽管他们恶毒地诬蔑社会主义国家，支持西藏叛乱分子，用杜勒斯的语言来诬蔑中华人民共和国及其伟大的领袖，并用种种阴谋反对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，但是像他们的主人——给南斯拉夫很多美元的美帝国主义一样，是永远也达不到自己的目的的。四十年来，帝国主义像疯狗一样不断地进攻伟大的苏维埃国家。他们用尽一切办法，不断造谣诽谤，但每一次都以失败告终。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，对兄弟的中华人民共和国以及对小小的阿尔巴尼亚也像一头野兽一样拼命嚎叫，而他们忠实的走狗贝尔格莱德修正主义者也完全和他们同流合污了。可是正如我国的谚语所说的：
  “狗叫得越多，咬得越少”，帝国主义者正是这样，他们疯狂地叫喊，但是不敢碰我们，因为他们知道他们是在跟谁打交道，如果他们敢于向我们进攻，那就等于自取灭亡，因为我们不是孤立的，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结一致，强大无比。而他们却正如毛泽东同志所说的是一只纸老虎。朝鲜战争、苏伊士运河事件、匈牙利反革命暴乱和西藏叛乱都是帝国主义直接组织下发动起来的，然而他们都失败了，这就是一切胆敢侵犯我们人民利益的人的命运。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民十分愉快地看到兄弟般的中国人民在人民政权十年内获得的伟大成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民把这些成就当作自己的一样，它进一步加强了中华人民共和国的经济和国防力量，同时也是兄弟的中国人民大踏步地向社会主义和共产主义道路前进的基础。这些成就进一步巩固了社会主义阵营。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团有机会亲眼看到中国人民在社会主义建设中获得的伟大成就。中国变成了一个大规模的建设工地。在中国工业大踏步发展的同时，农业也有很大的发展，人民的文化水平也在不断的提高，人民生活日益改善。我们感到非常高兴，我们党给我们这样好的机会，使我们能亲自看到兄弟的中华人民共和国——新的中国。从领导人到各工厂的工人、人民公社的社员对我们热情的、衷心的、亲切的招待，给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们在各地看到的人都是满面笑容，眼睛里闪耀着光芒，因为他们知道要和阿尔巴尼亚朋友见面了。我们到处都感到像在自己家里一样，人们处处给我们准备了很好的条件，这不仅让我们有机会认识不少朋友和表达我们之间的友谊，并且使我们能更好地向他们学习，学习他们的生活、他们的成就和经验，了解他们的困难。我们曾在城市、企业、人民公社，以兄弟和朋友的身份和他们一起劳动。我们在中国学到了很多工作经验，特别是领导农业的经验。当看到中国人民群众创造性地把党的政策运用在实际中的时候，我们感到无限的兴奋。我们看到了一般工作人员，在重工业和轻工业方面，正确地了解和贯彻两条腿走路的政策，为了建立现代化的工业和增加产品，利用了一切可以利用的东西，其中也包括了土办法。我们看到了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，工人用小块铁制成的简易机床生产规模巨大的机器。普通的公社社员给我们讲解农业“八字宪法”，我们从其中学了很多东西，同时也看到了他们如何贯彻这个“宪法”。社员的工作热情，他们对未来的信心以及在短短时期内获得的经济成就，这一切都证明了马克思列宁主义式的中国共产党首创的人民公社是中国建设社会主义和共产主义的最好形式。人民公社的路线是正确的。
    北京“五一”劳动节的游行给我们代表团团员留下了深刻的印象，它表示中国人民在党和伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下钢铁般的团结，它是中国人民对苏联人民及其他社会主义国家人民的友谊和热爱的表现，同时也是中国人民崇高的国际主义精神的表现。
    我们看到的一切使我们深信，中国人民正在以自己灵巧的双手和智慧以及他们的朴实和纯洁的心，在党的领导下，信心百倍地、大踏步地沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路迈进。
    我们将要带着难忘的印象离开中国，我们 要把在中国学到的宝贵的经验，把中国人民和中国共产党对阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的感情带回国去。对我们劳动党和人民来说，没有比在马克思列宁主义思想基础上建立起来的友谊更宝贵的了。因此我们党和我们人民要像保护自己的眼珠一样保护和发展同伟大的苏联和列宁建立的伟大的苏联共产党，同兄弟的中华人民共和国和中国共产党，以及同其他社会主义国家，同世界上一切兄弟共产党和劳动党之间的友谊。
    我们永远忠于马克思列宁主义的党，坚定不移地和一切企图破坏我们的团结、削弱我们的友谊的敌人，特别是用一切办法破坏我们的关系和友谊的贝尔格莱德修正主义集团作坚决的斗争。
    我国人民和苏联人民、中国人民以及其他社会主义国家的人民像一家人一样亲密团结，友好无间，我们永远和他们一起前进。中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民的心一起跳动，我们的思想和目标完全一致，鼓舞我们前进的理想也是共同的，因此我们的友谊日益巩固和发展，我们的友谊万古长青！
