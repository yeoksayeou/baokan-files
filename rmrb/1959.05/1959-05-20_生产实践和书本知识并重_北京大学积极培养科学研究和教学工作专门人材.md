Peking University has actively addressed the relationship between the following five aspects in its teaching and scientific research work, namely the relationship between direct and indirect experience, cutting-edge science and general science, theory and technology, current needs and long-term needs, basic courses and specialized courses, and the relationship between the ancient and the modern, thereby continuously improving the quality of teaching and scientific research.

Since last year, through the vigorous educational revolution movement and the implementation of the Party's educational policy, the tendency to belittle practice and direct experience has been reversed. To date, more than 3,500 teachers and students from thirteen departments of Peking University have gone to factories and rural areas to participate in production labor and conduct social investigations, and many teachers and students have also participated in the labor of trial-producing new products in factories run by the university.

Peking University emphasizes both production practice and book knowledge throughout the entire teaching process. To ensure that students have sufficient study time, the school recently stipulated that, in addition to production labor, students in each department should not spend less than sixteen to eighteen weeks of this semester on study. At present, all departments are actively engaged in the construction of teaching materials, re-compiling or revising various lecture notes and textbooks in accordance with the teaching requirements of further implementing the Party's educational policy. According to the teaching plan, students in each department spend no less than three years studying basic courses. This semester, 291 basic courses have been offered to students. The teaching content and methods of these basic courses are constantly being improved. For example, the chemistry department's Chemical Dynamics course has added content such as polymer chain reactions and nuclear chain reactions in atomic piles, striving to improve the teaching quality and theoretical level of this basic course. Basic science courses such as inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, general physics, and some basic liberal arts courses have achieved certain results through theoretical lectures to educate students in dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

Since last year, students' scientific research work has been formally included in the teaching plan. In the learning process, students participate in relevant scientific research under the guidance of teachers according to different grades and requirements. Lower-grade students mainly participate in some small-scale scientific activities, general technical work, some investigations and research, and data collection and organization. In addition to spending the first half of the year before graduation writing graduation theses, senior students also participate in some relatively systematic and theoretically strong research work in conjunction with the study of specialized courses in the fourth and fifth grades. For example, the semiconductor major requires third-year students to mainly participate in general production labor in factories to master the operating techniques of semiconductor devices and improve production skills; fourth and fifth-year students mainly conduct some exploratory theoretical research through the trial production of new products. In order to expand and deepen the specialized knowledge of senior students, Peking University has also added 23 new specialized courses this semester, including 12 courses that reflect the latest scientific achievements. The teaching methods of specialized courses have also been reformed in accordance with the spirit of combining teaching, scientific research, and production labor.

Peking University aims to cultivate specialized personnel with advanced scientific levels who are engaged in scientific research and teaching, attaching importance to the development of cutting-edge scientific parts in related disciplines, especially the development of major comprehensive cutting-edge science and technology. Since last year, in order to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in the national construction cause, Peking University has changed the unreasonable situation of the establishment of departments, majors, and specializations, and appropriately set up some necessary cutting-edge science departments, majors, and specializations, such as the Department of Atomic Energy, the Department of Radio Electronics, the major of Computer Technology and Automatic Control, the specialization of Radiation Biology, and so on. At the same time, it has vigorously carried out research work in semiconductors, radio electronics, computer technology, atomic energy, etc., and has achieved initial results. While developing cutting-edge science, Peking University pays considerable attention to the development of general science parts in various disciplines. One of the reasons why Peking University was able to make some achievements in semiconductors, computer technology, etc. last year is that it has a certain foundation in physics, mathematics, etc. When studying and developing comprehensive cutting-edge scientific theories, the science departments also carried out some necessary engineering and technical work, and manufactured many instruments, equipment and new products.

In the setting of disciplines and the selection of scientific research projects, Peking University not only attaches importance to cutting-edge science and technology and major theoretical problems that are more directly and closely related to current national production and construction and national defense construction, but also attaches importance to basic theories that are more indirectly related to current construction. Carrying out scientific research in these areas is for the needs of tomorrow and is also an important task undertaken by Peking University as a comprehensive university. At present, Peking University is conducting research in areas such as the theory of atmospheric circulation, the structure of atomic nuclei, and cybernetics.

Since last year, Peking University has criticized the bourgeois ideology in many teaching contents of the liberal arts, paid attention to implementing the spirit of "making the ancient serve the present" in curriculum settings and teaching contents, appropriately increased the weight of modern and contemporary content, and advocated teachers and students to go to factories and rural areas to investigate and study some practical and theoretical problems in the current class struggle and production struggle. At the same time, it also guides teachers and students to use the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to study and research the knowledge left over from history, summarize historical experiences and lessons, and serve socialist revolution and socialist construction.

In the process of striving to solve the above problems, the school has achieved new progress in improving teaching quality and scientific research. For example, third-year students of the Economics Department, on the one hand, studied five special topics related to the distribution of people's communes, and on the other hand, conducted investigations and research in Gaobeidian People's Commune in combination with production labor. They not only assisted the Party Committee of the People's Commune in formulating plans related to the distribution of the People's Commune, but also deepened their understanding of the theoretical problems of "the distribution problem under the socialist system" in political economics through learning and social investigation, and wrote papers on the distribution problem of the People's Commune. Various departments of foreign languages ​​and literature pay attention to strengthening the practical training of students' ability to listen, speak, write, and read. Some fifth-year students in the Department of Oriental Languages ​​quickly understood most of the Japanese broadcasts in Tokyo and could conduct conversations in Japanese for twenty to thirty minutes. The pulse course of the Department of Radio Electronics has added content such as "nanosecond" and "picosecond" and other latest scientific achievements this semester, while strengthening students' production practice exercises. Students have independently trial-produced new advanced instruments such as "nanosecond pulse generators" in combination with their learned theoretical knowledge. When teachers and students of the semiconductor specialization of the Physics Department put the transistors they had successfully trial-produced in the laboratory into production, they found that defective products often appeared. They used relevant theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge to conduct in-depth research and solved twenty-two problems in a short period of one month, and their scientific level was further improved.

    生产实践和书本知识并重
    北京大学积极培养科学研究和教学工作专门人材
    本报讯　北京大学在教学和科学研究工作中，积极地处理了以下五个方面的关系问题，即直接经验和间接经验的关系，尖端科学和一般科学、理论和技术的关系，当前需要和长远需要的关系，基础课和专门化课的关系，古和今的关系，使教学和科学研究工作质量不断的提高。
    去年以来，经过轰轰烈烈的教育革命运动，和党的教育方针的贯彻，扭转了轻视实践、轻视直接经验的倾向。到目前为止，北京大学已有十三个系的三千五百多名师生先后下厂下乡参加生产劳动，进行社会调查，还有许多师生在校内自办工厂参加试制新产品的劳动。
    北京大学在整个教学过程中，既重视生产实践，也重视书本知识。为了保证学生有足够的学习时间，最近学校规定，除生产劳动外，本学期各系学生的学习时间不得少于十六至十八周。目前各系都在积极进行教材的建设工作，按照进一步贯彻党的教育方针的教学要求，重新编写或修改各种讲义和教科书。按照教学计划的规定，各系学生用于学习基础课程的时间不少于三年。本学期为学生开设的各种基础课就有二百九十一门。这些基础课的教学内容和教学方法不断在进行改进。例如，化学系的化学动力学一课就增加了高分子聚合链锁反应、原子堆中原子核的链锁反应等内容，努力提高这门基础课的教学质量和理论水平。无机化学、有机化学、普通物理等理科基础课和文科的一些基础课，通过理论的讲授，对学生进行辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的教育，已取得了一定成绩。
    从去年开始，学生的科学研究工作已被正式列入教学计划之内。学生们在学习过程中，根据不同年级、不同要求，在教师指导下分别参加有关的科学研究。低年级学生主要是参加一些小型的科学活动，一般技术性工作，一些调查研究和资料搜集、整理等等。高年级学生除了应用毕业前半年的时间写作毕业论文外，还结合四、五年级专门化课程的学习，参加一部分比较系统的理论性较强的研究工作。例如半导体专业，要求三年级学生主要参加工厂一般生产劳动，掌握半导体器件的操作技术，改进生产技能；四、五年级则主要通过新产品的试制进行一些探索性的理论研究工作。为了扩大和加深高年级学生的专门知识，本学期北大还增开了二十三门新的专门化课程，其中包括十二门反映现代最新科学成就的课程。专门化课程的教学方法，也根据教学、科学研究和生产劳动三结合的精神进行了革新。
    北京大学要培养具有先进科学水平的、从事科学研究和教学工作的专门人材，重视有关学科中尖端科学部分的发展，特别是重大的综合性尖端科学技术的发展。去年起，北大为适应国家建设事业大跃进的新形势，改变系科、专业设置不够合理的情况，适当设置了一些必要的尖端科学方面的系、专业和专门化，如原子能系、无线电电子学系、计算技术与自动控制专业，放射生物学专门化，等等。同时大力开展了半导体、无线电电子学、计算技术、原子能等方面的研究工作，并取得了初步成绩。在发展尖端科学的同时，北京大学相当注意各门学科中一般科学部分的发展，去年北大所以能在半导体、计算技术等方面作出一些成绩，原因之一，正是在物理、数学等方面有一定的基础。理科各系在研究和发展综合性尖端科学理论时，还进行了一些必要的工程技术工作，制造出不少仪器设备与新产品。
    在学科的设置和科学研究项目的选择上，北京大学不但重视与当前国家生产建设和国防建设联系比较直接、比较密切的尖端科学技术和重大的理论问题，同时也重视与当前建设联系比较间接的基本理论。开展这些方面的科学研究，是为了明天的需要，也是作为综合性大学的北京大学担负的重要任务。目前北大正在进行着大气环流的理论、原子核结构、控制论等方面的研究。
    去年以来，北京大学批判了文科不少教学内容上的资产阶级思想，在课程设置和教学内容上注意了贯彻古为今用的精神，适当增加了近代现代的分量，并提倡师生到工厂农村去调查研究当前阶级斗争和生产斗争中的一些实际问题和理论问题。同时，还引导师生们用马克思列宁主义的观点，去学习研究历史上遗留下来的知识，总结历史上的经验教训，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。
    在努力解决以上问题当中，这个学校在提高教学质量和科学研究方面获得了新进展。如经济系三年级学生，一方面学习了有关人民公社的分配等五个专题，一方面在高碑店人民公社结合生产劳动进行调查研究，不但协助人民公社党委制定了有关人民公社分配的方案，并且通过学习和社会调查，加深了对于政治经济学中关于“社会主义制度下的分配问题”的理论问题的理解，写出了关于人民公社分配问题的论文。外国语言文学各系注意加强对学生听、说、写、读四会能力的实际训练，东语系五年级有的学生，较快地大部听懂了东京日语广播，而且能用日语进行二十到三十分钟的会话、无线电电子学系的脉冲课程，这学期增加了“毫微秒”、
  “微微秒”等最新科学成就的内容，同时加强了学生的生产实践锻炼。学生们已经结合所学理论知识，独立地试制成功“毫微秒脉冲发生器”等新的高级仪器。物理系半导体专门化的师生，将他们在实验室试制成功的三极管投入生产时，发现常出次品，他们运用有关理论知识和实践知识进行深入的钻研，在短短的一个月的时间内，就解决了二十二个难题，科学水平得到了进一步的提高。
