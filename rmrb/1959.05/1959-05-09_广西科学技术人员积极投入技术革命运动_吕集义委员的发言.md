    Guangxi Scientific and Technical Personnel Actively Participate in the Technological Revolution Movement
    Speech by Committee Member Lü Jiyi

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully agree with and resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

    Premier Zhou's report made important instructions regarding the self-transformation of old intellectuals through work practice; Vice Chairman Li's report proposed that the CPPCC's future work should promote the participation of various democratic parties and democratic figures in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, as well as self-transformation; Vice Premier Li Fuchun called for an immediate launch of a production increase and conservation movement centered on technological revolution on all fronts of the national economy, to ensure the completion and striving for overfulfillment of the 1959 plan. All these instructions and calls have extremely important guiding significance for our work.

    In order to fully leverage the potential strength of scientific and technical personnel, and to strengthen their self-transformation through work practice, the Guangxi CPPCC, under the leadership and assistance of the Regional Party Committee, began in December of last year to organize and promote more than 1,000 scientific and technical personnel from democratic party members and democratic figures in various agencies and units in the Autonomous Region and Nanning City to actively participate in the technological revolution and present gifts to the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Over the past few months, preliminary achievements have been made, and some experiences have been gained.

    1959 is a year to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, and it is also a crucial year for the three years of hard struggle. In order to ensure the victorious realization of the grand plan of the national economy in 1959, the Party calls on us to continue to struggle hard. The People's Daily editorial clearly pointed out that the road of hard struggle is the road of technological revolution. Only by continuously improving technology, improving tools, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization can we maximize labor productivity, carry out construction at high speed, and complete and overfulfill the tasks of the 1959 plan.

    Therefore, we considered that if we promote the active participation of a considerable number of scientific and technical personnel in our region in the technological revolution movement, explore potential, and vigorously engage in creation, invention, and technological innovation, we will certainly be able to make greater contributions to socialist construction. At the same time, they have undergone a series of socialist education through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and their political positions have been transformed to varying degrees, their ideological awareness has been enhanced to a certain extent, and they have established the idea of serving socialism. Under the circumstances of the compelling situation, everyone deeply felt the need to further dedicate their technology and strength, and to strive to transform themselves through such concrete content. Therefore, when the CPPCC proposed launching a technological revolution movement to present gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, the vast majority of scientific and technical personnel actively participated and were greatly encouraged.

    The situation in the past three months has been exciting. In the movement, most of them have revised their plans according to the requirements of serving production and construction, striving to be both advanced and practical; they have also gone deep into the grassroots, construction sites, and the masses to carry out scientific and technological research, combined with production to vigorously engage in technological innovation, and their enthusiasm has been increasing. In just two or three months, the staff of the Regional People's Hospital have completed more than 2,000 major and minor technological innovation projects; some engineering and technical personnel of the Regional Department of Transportation have also completed dozens of projects; other units have also made many achievements. This fully illustrates that the potential of scientific and technical personnel is very great, and they themselves have the desire to contribute to socialist construction. As long as leadership and assistance are strengthened and guidance is provided according to the situation, their active role can be brought into play. Premier Zhou pointed out: "We should... value their enthusiasm in work and help them make more achievements in their work." This is completely correct. We will definitely strive to do so according to the Premier's instructions in the future.

    At the beginning of the movement, some people still had various ideological obstacles: some believed that their technology had already been dedicated, so what else could be dedicated; others thought that the work was already very tense, and engaging in technological revolution would be too much to bear; some were afraid that setting plans and targets would be unsuccessful, but seeing that others were setting them, they felt it was not good not to set them, but they set them very conservatively; and many people did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the movement, and therefore did not pay enough attention to it. In response to these situations, we repeatedly provided enlightenment and assistance through various means, explaining the significance, principles, and requirements of the technological revolution, and carried out study and discussions. We held three conferences, each one larger than the previous one, and each step deeper than the previous one, gradually forming a vigorous mass movement, so that everyone was involved in the movement, promoting each other and promoting each other, becoming a conscious action, and many ideological problems were solved. Many people said with emotion: The Party is so concerned about our progress, what reason do we have not to dedicate everything we have? Thus, they criticized their past belief that there was nothing to dedicate, and the fear that plans could not be realized, mainly because their minds were not liberated, and they did not combine scientific and technological research with production. Now that they have clarified this, there are many more things to dedicate; at the same time, they also criticized the fear of tension and the fear of being unable to bear it, all of which were caused by the bourgeois exploitation ideology. Compared with the workers and peasants who work selflessly for the Party and the cause of socialism, we are too far behind, and we should learn from the workers and peasants. Some engineers in the Regional Department of Transportation did not dare to propose technological innovation targets in the past and had many concerns, but in the high tide of the movement, they posted big-character posters guaranteeing that they would complete 20 technological innovation projects before National Day.

    With the development of the movement, we have deeply realized that promoting the participation of scientific and technical personnel in the technological revolution movement is an important and concrete way of self-transformation. Because the process of a person's determination and efforts to contribute to the cause of socialism is also the process of continuous improvement of socialist consciousness. Obviously, when he actively participates in the technological revolution and presents gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, he will receive a profound and vivid education in patriotism and socialism. Transformation and service are consistent, good transformation leads to better service, and good service can promote transformation. It is useless to talk about transformation without service. Whether service is good or not is a concrete test of whether transformation is good or not. Premier Zhou said: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in future long-term work practice." This is a great education for us. Guangxi's scientific and technical personnel have achieved significant gains through this way of transformation: Generally, they have further approached the Party, and they believe that the Party's concern and supervision of them is their love and trust, and they feel very excited and happy, and feel that they would be sorry for the Party if they did not achieve anything. Moreover, due to the Party Committee's strengthened leadership, through concrete work, the relationship between scientific and technical personnel and the Party has also become closer than in the past. Some people who never went to the Party Committee's door in the past have now often gone to the office of the Party General Branch to ask for instructions and report on their work, and to confide in the Party. In this way, the fundamental issue of accepting the Party's leadership has been better resolved. At the same time, due to the active participation of scientific and technical personnel in the technological revolution movement, putting politics in command, increasing their love for the cause of socialism, establishing a sense of responsibility for work, and giving play to the initiative and enthusiasm of work, it shows that their political and ideological level has been greatly improved.

    The Party's leadership is the main key to promoting the victorious development of the movement and achieving results. However, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as a form of united front organization, has the responsibility to undertake this work under the leadership of the Party and actively play the role of organization and promotion. Facts have proved that as long as we do it seriously, we will definitely do it well and achieve results. At present, our work is still in the process of exploration and advancement, and we cannot talk about any successful experience, but we believe that this is an important task for the CPPCC at present and must be completed. We will certainly follow Premier Zhou's instructions: under the firm leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, unite closely, continue to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and use the active actions of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great motherland - the People's Republic of China!

    广西科学技术人员积极投入技术革命运动
    吕集义委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并坚决拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，以及李富春和李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    周总理报告对于旧知识分子通过工作实践进行自我改造作了重要的指示；李副主席报告提出政协今后的工作应推动各民主党派和民主人士参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业及进行自我改造；李富春副总理号召立即在国民经济的各个战线上开展一个以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，以保证一九五九年计划的完成和争取超额完成。所有这些指示和号召，对于我们的工作都有极其重大的指导意义。
    为了充分发挥科技人员的潜在力量，并从工作实践中加强其自我改造，广西区政协在区党委的领导和帮助下，从去年十二月开始组织推动自治区和南宁市各机关单位的民主党派成员和民主人士中科技人员一千多人开展了一个积极参加技术革命，向中华人民共和国建国十周年献礼的运动。几个月来，已取得了初步的成绩，亦有了一些体会。
    一九五九年是在一九五八年全国大跃进的基础上争取更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年，也是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年。为了保证一九五九年国民经济宏伟计划的胜利实现，党号召我们必须继续苦战。而苦战的道路，人民日报社论明确指出，是技术革命的道路。只有不断地改进技术、改进工具、改进操作方法、改进劳动组织，才能最大限度地提高劳动生产率，高速度地进行建设，才能完成和超额完成一九五九年的计划任务。
    因此，我们考虑到，在为数不少的我区科技人员中，如果推动他们积极投入技术革命运动，发掘潜力，大搞创造发明、技术革新，对于建设社会主义就一定能够作出较大的贡献。同时，他们经过了反右斗争、整风运动一系列的社会主义教育，政治立场有了不同程度的转变，思想觉悟获得一定的提高，树立了为社会主义服务的思想。在形势咄咄逼人的情况之下，大家都深深地感觉到有必要进一步地献出自己的技术和力量，并通过这么一个具体内容来努力改造自己。所以当政协提出开展技术革命运动，向国庆十周年献礼的号召后，绝大多数的科技人员都踊跃参加，欢欣鼓舞。
    三个月来的情况是令人兴奋的。在运动中，他们大都根据为生产建设服务的要求，修订了自己的规划，力求既先进又落实；并深入基层、工地和群众一道进行科技的研究工作，结合生产大搞技术革新，干劲越来越大。在短短的两三个月中，区人民医院职工已完成技术革新大小项目达二千多项；区交通厅部分工程技术人员亦已完成数十项；其他单位也有了不少的成就。充分地说明了科技人员的潜力是很大的，加以他们自己亦有了为社会主义建设贡献力量的愿望，只要加强领导和帮助，因势利导，就能够发挥他们的积极作用。周总理指出：“我们应当……重视他们在工作中的积极性，帮助他们在工作中作出更多的成绩来。”这是完全正确的。我们今后一定努力照着总理的指示去做。
    在运动开始时，也还有一些人存在各种思想障碍：有的认为自己的技术都已献出来了，还有什么可献；有的又认为现在工作已很紧张，再搞什么技术革命，可吃不消；有的怕订规划提指标落空，但看见人家都在订，自己不好不订，却订得很保守；而较多的人对于运动的意义认识不足，因而重视不够。针对这些情况，我们通过各种方式反复进行启发帮助，阐明技术革命的意义、方针和要求，开展学习讨论，先后举行过三次大会，一次比一次扩大，一步比一步深入，逐步形成一个声势浩大的群众运动，使大家都卷进运动中去，互相推动，互相促进，成为自觉的行动，许多思想问题也就得到解决。很多的人感动地说：党委这样的关怀我们的进步，我们有什么理由不献出自己的一切呢？从而批判了自己过去认为没有什么可献，怕计划不能实现，主要在于思想没有解放，而且没有把科学技术的研究工作和生产结合起来，现在明确了，可献的东西就多了；同时，他们又批判了怕紧张，怕吃不消，都是资产阶级剥削思想在作怪，比起为党和社会主义事业而忘我地劳动的工人、农民，我们实在相差太远，只有感到惭愧，我们应该向工农群众学习，区交通厅有个别工程师过去不敢提技术革新指标。顾虑重重，但在运动高潮中却贴出大字报保证在国庆前要完成二十项的技术革新项目。
    随着运动的发展，我们深刻体会到，推动科技人员参加技术革命运动是一条重要的具体的自我改造途径。因为，一个人决心并努力为社会主义事业作出贡献的过程，也就是社会主义觉悟不断提高的过程。很明显，当他在积极参加技术革命、向国庆十周年献礼的过程中，他就会受到深刻的、生动的爱国主义和社会主义的教育。改造与服务是一致的，改造得好，就服务得更好，服务得好也就能够促进改造。离开了服务而空谈改造是不会有什么效果的。服务得好不好是改造得好不好的具体考验。周总理说：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步实现自我改造。”对于我们是一个很大的教育。广西科技人员通过这条途径进行改造，已得到显著的收获：一般地都已进一步地靠拢了党，他们认为党关怀、督促自己，是对自己的爱护和信任，感到十分的兴奋和愉快，觉得如搞不出什么名堂就对不起党。并且，由于党委的加强领导，通过具体工作，科技人员跟党的关系也比过去密切了，过去有些人从来不上党委的门的，现在也已经常到党总支的办公室请示汇报工作并向党交心了。这么一来，对于接受党的领导这个根本问题就得到了较好的解决。同时，由于科技人员积极投入技术革命运动，政治挂帅，对社会主义事业的热爱有了增进，树立了工作的责任感，发挥了工作的主动性和积极性，也就说明了政治思想已有了很大的提高。
    党的领导是促使运动胜利开展取得成绩的主要关键。但是，作为统一战线组织形式的政治协商会议，它有责任在党的领导下把这一工作担负起来，积极地发挥组织推动的作用。事实证明，只要认真的做，就一定会做得好，做出成绩。目前，我们的工作还在摸索前进中，还谈不到有什么成功的经验，但我们认定，这是政协当前一次重要的工作任务，必须把它完成。我们一定遵照周总理的指示：坚决地在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，紧密地团结起来，继续贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年！
