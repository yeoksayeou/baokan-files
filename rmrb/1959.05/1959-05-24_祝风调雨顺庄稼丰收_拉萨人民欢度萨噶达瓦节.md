Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 23rd. Lhasa's Tibetan monks, nuns and lay people celebrated the first "Saga Dawa" festival after the rebellion was quelled on the 22nd, according to traditional ethnic customs.

The "Saga Dawa" festival is a festival for Tibetan Buddhists to commemorate the birth, enlightenment, and Nirvana of Sakyamuni, and to wish for a good harvest of crops. It is held every year on the 15th day of the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar.

Early in the morning on the 22nd, all the temples in Lhasa held prayer ceremonies, and the monks offered sacrifices and chanted scriptures in front of the Buddha statues. At noon, groups of Tibetan citizens, carrying food and tents, went to the beautiful Linka (i.e., gardens) to celebrate the festival. The Dragon King Pond behind the Potala Palace was the most popular place for tourists. There is a clear lake, and a five-story pavilion stands in the heart of the lake, surrounded by verdant weeping willows and poplars. The Lhasa Municipal Residents' Committee set up spacious tents under the trees, and the residents gathered together to sing and dance. The song and dance teams of the Lhasa Youth Federation and Women's Federation attracted a large crowd of spectators.

The groves of green trees in the Dragon King Pond Linka were filled with laughter. Folk artists were drumming on leather drums and playing iron harps. The blind woman, Xirao Wangmu, also came to the Dragon King Pond with her mother, holding a six-stringed lute. Before the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, Xirao Wangmu was still wandering the streets, without food or clothing. Her six-stringed lute always played sad tunes. Now, the Lhasa Military Control Commission has provided her with relief and arrangements for her life, and Xirao Wangmu's six-stringed lute plays joyful tunes.

Many Tibetans were cruising on the lake in yak-hide boats, and they happily planted bright red national flags on the bows of the boats. Tourists were particularly enthusiastic in the pavilion in the heart of the lake. In the past, only the Kalons of the former Tibetan local government could go there. Some poor citizens, although they had lived in Lhasa for decades, were visiting the pavilion for the first time. Now, on the Lhasa plain, crops such as highland barley, wheat, and rapeseed have grown lush green. Many elderly Tibetans, upon arriving at the Dragon King Pond, sprinkled zanba on the lake, wishing for favorable weather and a bumper harvest this year.

Many Han cadres, workers, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also came to the Dragon King Pond to enjoy the park with the Tibetan people. (See picture)

    祝风调雨顺庄稼丰收
    拉萨人民欢度萨噶达瓦节
    新华社拉萨23日电　拉萨市藏族僧俗人民22日按照传统的民族形式，欢乐地度过了叛乱平息后的第一个“萨噶达瓦”节。
    “萨噶达瓦”节是西藏佛教徒纪念释迦牟尼诞生、成道和圆寂，并预祝农作物丰收的节日，于每年藏历4月15日举行。
  22日清早，拉萨各寺庙都举行了祈祷法会，僧侣们在佛像前上供诵经。中午，成群结队的藏族市民带着酒食和帐篷到风景优美的林卡（即园林）里去欢度节日。布达拉宫后面的龙王塘是游人最多的地方，那里有一个清澈的小湖，湖心耸立着一幢五层殿阁，翠绿的垂柳和白杨环绕在湖的四周。拉萨市的居民委员会在树荫底下搭设了宽大的帐篷，居民们团聚在一起唱歌跳舞。拉萨市青联和妇联的歌舞队吸引了一大群观众。
    龙王塘的林卡里的丛丛绿树中到处洋溢着欢声笑语。民间艺人们在敲击皮鼓，弹奏铁琴。女盲人喜饶汪姆也抱着六弦琴和她母亲一起来到龙王塘。拉萨叛乱平息以前，喜饶汪姆还流浪街头，衣食无着，她的六弦琴一直奏着悲伤的曲调，如今，拉萨市军管会对她的生活作了救济和安排，喜饶汪姆的六弦琴奏出了欢乐的调子。
    很多藏胞乘坐牛皮船在湖中游荡，他们高兴地把鲜红的国旗插在船头上。湖心的殿阁里游人特别踊跃，过去，那里只有原西藏地方政府的噶伦才能去，有些贫苦市民虽然在拉萨住了几十年，这次也是第一次来到殿阁参观。现在，拉萨平原上，青稞、小麦和油菜等农作物已长得一片葱绿。许多藏族老人一来到龙王塘，就把?粑洒在湖面上，预祝今年风调雨顺，庄稼丰收。
    许多汉族干部、工人和人民解放军官兵也来到龙王塘和藏族人民一起游园。（附图片）
