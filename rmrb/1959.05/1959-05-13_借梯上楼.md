Borrowing a Ladder to Climb Upstairs

    Recently, a heart-warming story of "borrowing a ladder to climb upstairs" has been circulating in the Taiping Commune of Jintang County, Sichuan: The Third Production Team learned from the experience of the neighboring advanced production team to implement the production quota system, and the entire team is determined to win a large area of high yield.

    Originally, there were two unevenly irrigated and infertile mountain gullies in the Taiping Commune. One gully was the First Production Team. Last year, they fully mobilized the masses to implement the plan and vigorously developed diversified operations. "The poor mountain gully turned into a treasure pot." The other gully was the Third Production Team. Last year, when the production plan was formulated, it was not fully discussed and deliberated by the masses, and the increase in production was not significant, and the family fortune was still very meager. Recently, the Third Team seized the important opportunity of formulating a production quota plan, visited and studied the experience of the First Team in detail, and invited Yuan Yongfa, the captain of the First Team, to make a report. On this basis, they mobilized the commune members to come up with ideas and methods to implement the production quota plan.

    The First Team and the Third Team (formerly two small cooperatives) were both formed in 1956 by forty or fifty impoverished farmers. During individual operation, more than 80% of the farmers in the two mountain gullies lacked grain and had to rely on the state to supply 10,000 to 20,000 jin of food grain every year. At that time, they lacked cattle, seeds, and production funds... They only relied on the commune members to mix coarse grains, melons, and beans to save some grain for seeds, and the production funds were also pieced together by the commune members. In the autumn of 1957, the two mountain gullies had a "small turnaround" in economy. Each sold 40,000 to 50,000 jin of surplus grain, bought back cattle and farm tools, and saved some cash. In addition, after the expansion of the agricultural cooperative, many wealthy farmers joined, and the means of production were no longer felt to be so lacking. In 1958, when formulating the production quota plan, these two production teams had different attitudes towards relying on the masses. When the First Team formulated the production quota plan, they still relied on the masses as before, and the plan was formulated prudently. As a result, they overfulfilled the leap forward plan in the autumn. The Third Team was not like this. The plan was not realistic, and as a result, it fell through.

    When the First Team formulated the production target last year, it was initially a bit too high (increasing production by one and a half times compared with the previous year, and the average yield per mu was to reach more than 1,000 jin of grain). However, they paid attention to mobilizing the masses to discuss and analyze this target, and found that only a few lazy people agreed with this too high target. For example, some lazy people said: "If the target is set too high, no one can complete it, everyone will lose production, and no one will lose production." Most commune members criticized this target as "a play on the stage, just going through the motions" and demanded a revision. The cadres accepted the opinions of the commune members, mobilized everyone to carefully calculate and tap the potential for increased production. After discussion by the masses, an index of 80% increase in total grain output was proposed based on the actual situation. Therefore, everyone had the confidence to complete and strive to exceed the target. As a result, the total grain output increased by one time compared with the previous year. The Third Team failed to revise the original target of increasing production by one and a half times according to the opinions of the masses. The plan fell through, and the total output increased by only more than 30%. Recently, when formulating the production quota target for spring crops in 1959, the Third Team accepted the experience of the First Team, mobilized the masses to calculate the potential for increased production mountain by mountain and hill by hill, and revised the original production quota target of increasing total grain output by more than one time to an increase of 70%. The goal of the masses' struggle is to strive for double the production. The team members said: "This time, the target is set realistically. If we don't work hard, we will definitely lose production. If we put in a little effort, we will surely exceed it."

    When introducing the experience, the captain of the First Team also said: "Not only the target must be set just right, but also the measures must be appropriate, just like cooking, you must hold the heat steady. This can only be done by relying on the masses. Those who live near the mountains know the birds' songs, and those who live near the water know the nature of the fish. Which hill's production increase measures should first be expressed by the people of that hill, and then discussed and decided. In this way, the commune members will not be worried when implementing the measures, but will be convinced and implement them without compromise. In other words, the measures must be implemented in the hearts of the commune members." The cadres and commune members of the Third Team listened to these words and praised them repeatedly: "That's right, that's right!" They accepted this experience, and in the recent formulation of production increase measures, they changed the past perfunctory practices and democratically discussed and determined the technical specifications for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter." On the issue of close planting, they determined the amount of seeds and seedlings for each field based on the eight different types of soil in the team, as well as the depth of the soil layer, the degree of deep plowing, the crop varieties, and the fertilization status. The amount of seedlings used in paddy fields was changed from at least 50,000 nests per mu to 30,000, 35,000, 40,000, and 45,000 nests per mu, and the number of plants was also determined to be nine, seven respectively. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission after close planting, directional strip planting was also adopted (that is, according to different terrains, the strip planting method was determined for each field to be mainly sunny or leeward and downwind), and on the issue of fertilization, according to everyone's opinions, they tried their best to apply the soil fertilizer with little fertilizer effect to the thin land to thicken the soil layer. Other fertilizers of various properties are reasonably applied according to the soil, crops and growth conditions, and are well coordinated with irrigation. According to the calculations of the commune members, with such reasonable fertilization, coupled with attention to preserving fertilizer efficiency and composting fertilizer, one jin of existing fertilizer can be used as two jin.

    "Don't be afraid of negative opinions when setting plans. A good plan includes finding unfavorable conditions and turning them into favorable conditions, as well as acknowledging those difficulties that cannot be overcome temporarily." This is the third experience that the Third Team learned from the First Team. According to this experience, while talking about the favorable conditions, they also put forward difficulties such as 200 mu of dry land without water source, lack of pesticides, labor and fertilizer. Then, they mobilized the masses to analyze the difficulties and try to overcome them. As a result, a large part of the negative factors became positive factors. For example, in the process of discussing the plan, the commune members found three large springs in the mountains, which can solve the water use of 150 mu of dry land.

    They also adopted reasonable fertilization, collected poisonous weeds, and reasonably organized and deployed labor to overcome difficulties such as lack of fertilizer, pesticides, and labor. In order to effectively solve these problems, everyone selected commune member Zhou Ziyun to lead people to dig springs and build water diversion channels; old farmer Zhang Qiyun served as the commander of rational fertilization; and Communist Youth League branch secretary Luo Yuanshu led the collection of poisonous weeds.

    The Third Team's discussion on the production quota plan (including visits and field surveys) lasted a total of eight days. The vast majority of the 180 commune members in the team expressed their opinions in the general meeting and small meetings, and put forward more than 60 rationalization proposals. All the indicators, measures and technical specifications were discussed and approved by the masses, and a production quota contract was signed on this basis.

    借梯上楼
    四川金堂县太平公社在最近传出一段“借梯上楼”的佳话：第三生产队学习邻近先进生产队的经验，使包产计划落实，全队一心要赢得大面积高产。
    原来，太平公社有两条水旱不匀、土地瘦薄的山沟，一条山沟是第一生产队，去年这时充分发动群众，使计划落实，加上大搞多种经营，“穷山沟变成了聚宝盆”。另一条山沟是第三生产队，去年制定生产计划时没经群众充分讨论酝酿，增产不多，家底子仍然很薄。最近，三队抓住制定包产计划这一重要时机，详细访问研究了一队的经验，并把一队队长袁永发请来作了报告，在这个基础上发动社员出主意、想办法，使包产计划落实。
    一队和三队（过去是两个小社），都是1956年由四五十户贫苦农民组成的。个体经营时，两条山沟里80％以上的农户都缺粮，每年要靠国家供应一二万斤口粮。当时，他们缺少耕牛、种籽、生产资金……，只是依靠社员们掺吃粗粮、瓜豆才节省出一部分粮食做种，生产资金也全靠社员们东拼西凑。1957年秋天，两条山沟在经济上有了一个“小翻身”，各自卖出四五万斤余粮，买回了耕牛、农具，还存了一部分现金，再加上扩大农业社以后，有不少富裕农民参加，生产资料就不再感到那么缺了。在1958年制定包产计划时，这两个生产队对待依靠群众有了不同的态度。一队制定包产计划时，仍然像以往那样依靠群众，计划订的稳妥，结果秋后超额实现了跃进计划；三队却不是这样，计划订的不实在，结果落了空。
    一队在去年制定包产指标时，起初也有些偏高（比上年增产一倍半，平均亩产要达到一千多斤粮食），但是，他们注意发动群众讨论、分析这个指标，发觉只有个别懒汉才赞成这种偏高的指标。例如有的懒汉说：“指标订高了，谁也完不成，大家都赔产，也就都不赔产了。”多数社员则批评这种指标是
  “戏台上接婆娘，走走过场”，纷纷要求重新修订。干部接受了社员意见，发动大家仔细计算，挖掘增产潜力。经过群众讨论，根据实际情况提出了粮食总产量增长80％的指标，因此，大家都有信心完成并争取超产，结果，粮食总产量比上年增长一倍。三队因为没有根据群众的意见修改原订增产一倍半的指标，计划落了空，总产量只增长三成多。最近，三队在制定1959年大春作物的包产指标时，接受了一队的经验，发动群众逐山逐丘计算增产潜力，把原订粮食总产量增长一倍多的包产指标修改为增产70％，群众的奋斗目标是争取加番。队员们说：“这次，指标订的实在，如果不下功夫定要赔产，加上一把劲儿准能超过”。
    一队队长在介绍经验时还谈到：“不但指标要订的不高不低，措施也要订的恰到好处，就像做饭一样要拿稳火色。这只有依靠群众才能做到，近山识鸟音，近水知鱼性，哪一丘的增产措施首先要让哪一丘的人发表意见，然后再讨论决定。这样，社员在贯彻措施时就不会提心吊胆，而是心服口服不打折扣，换句话说，措施要落实在社员的心头”。三队的干部和社员听了这一些话乐呵呵地连声称赞：“对头，硬是对头！”他们接受了这一经验，在最近制定增产措施时，改变了过去的草率做法，民主讨论确定了贯彻“八字宪法”的技术规格‘在密植问题上，他们根据本队八种不同性质的土壤以及土层深浅、深耕程度、作物品种、施肥状况等分别为每一块田确定了多少不同的用种量和用秧量，稻田用秧由原订每亩至少栽插五万窝分别改为每亩三万、三万五、四万、四万五千窝，棵数也分别确定为九棵、七棵。同时为解决密植后的通风透光问题，还采取定向条栽（即根据不同地势，分别确定每块田以向阳为主或顺风、顺水为主的条栽方法），在施肥问题上，根据大家的意见，他们把肥效不大的土肥尽量施在薄地上，加厚土层。其它各种性质的肥料则根据土壤、作物和生长状况合理施用，而且和灌溉配合好。据社员们计算，像这样合理施肥，再加上注意保存肥效和沤制肥料，现有的肥料一斤能顶两斤用。
    “订计划不怕有反面意见，一份好的计划就包括找到不利条件和变不利为有利，也包括承认那些暂时无法克服的困难”，这是三队从一队学来的第三条经验。他们根据这一经验，在大讲有利条件的同时，摆出了二百亩旱地没有水源，没有农药、劳动力和肥料不足等困难。接着，便发动群众分析困难和设法克服困难。结果，使很大一部分消极因素变成了积极因素。例如，在讨论计划的过程中，社员们便在山上找到了三股较大的泉水，可以解决一百五十亩旱地的用水。
    他们还采取了合理施肥，采集毒草、合理组织调配劳动力等办法，击破了缺少肥料，农药、劳动力等困难。为了切实解决这些问题，大家又选定社员周子云带人挖泉水和修建引水渠道；老农张启云担任合理施肥指挥长；共青团支部书记罗远书领导采集毒草。
    三队这次讨论包产计划（包括访问和实地勘测研究）一共历时八天，全队一百八十名社员绝大多数分别在大会和小会上发表了意见，提出的合理化建议有六十多条，一切指标，措施和技术规格都经群众讨论通过，在此基础上签订了包产合同。
