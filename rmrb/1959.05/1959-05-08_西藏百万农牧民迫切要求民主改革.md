Destroy the reactionary, dark, and barbaric serf system. Build a democratic, happy, and socialist new Tibet.

Millions of Tibetan Farmers and Herdsmen Urgently Demand Democratic Reform

On the plateau, the serfs who have been oppressed for generations sing the praises of the victory of the suppression of the rebellion: "A happy sun rises in the sky, and a living Buddha—the Communist Party—has come to the earth. In our generation, a better life is about to begin!"

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th: Our reporter reports: More than 1.1 million farmers and herdsmen, accounting for 95% of Tibet's population, demand the destruction of the extremely barbaric, cruel, and dark serf system, the permanent end to the miserable life of oppression and enslavement they have suffered for many years, and to join hands with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country to move towards the most happy and fulfilling society.

The rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet has now been basically quelled, which makes the working people of Tibet even more eager to implement reforms. At mass rallies to quell the rebellion held recently in various places, farmers, while accusing the rebels of their crimes, have stated one after another: The upper-class reactionary clique has openly betrayed the motherland, and the serf system they insist on should no longer be preserved!

In Lhasa, Qamdo, Shannan, Gyantse, and other vast rural areas, the poor Chaba and Duiqiong (both are serfs) and Langsheng (house slaves) are anxiously asking the People's Liberation Army and staff: "When will liberation (reform) come?" "The Kashag and the reactionary nobles have harmed us miserably. When will the reform begin?" They have been crying to the PLA about the pain they have personally suffered, begging the Communist Party and the PLA to help them stand up immediately. Gesang Dawa, who fled to Lhasa to work as a temporary worker because he could not bear the heavy exploitation, complained: "My father died of exhaustion because of the heavy burden. I couldn't pay the rent and couldn't afford the corvée, so I had to run away to make a living. In the past, there were more than a dozen families in our village, but now there are only a few left because of fleeing. The old system forced our families to be broken up. I demand immediate reform so that we can return to our hometowns to produce.” Luosang Raodeng, a Chaba (serf) from Caizong, told the staff, "If the old system is not reformed, we farmers will not be able to survive." He recounted the tragic experiences of his grandfather, father, and himself. One year, his grandfather had to borrow fifty ke (one ke equals twenty-five city catties) of highland barley from the Tibetan government because his family was ill and his livestock died. He originally thought that he could pay off the debt as long as the whole family saved money and food. However, Luosang Raodeng's grandfather did not pay it off until his death. Luosang Raodeng's father continued to work for the rest of his life, but still did not pay it off. In Luosang Raodeng's generation, more than twenty years have passed, and three generations of grandfathers, fathers, and sons have handed over a large amount of grain. Until March of this year, when the former Tibetan local government launched a rebellion, not only was the fifty ke of grain debt not paid off, but the principal and interest turned into one thousand six hundred ke. Luosang Raodeng said: "Usury is like a bottomless black hole. Once you fall in, you can't climb out. We can't suffer this crime anymore."

Now in the rural areas of Tibet, the vast number of farmers are welcoming their first spring plowing after their rebirth with infinite excitement. When the bandits entrenched themselves and fled, they carried out frantic destruction of rural production, but the farmers are determined to respond to the Party's call: not to abandon one mu of land. The farmers of Caizong have also formulated patriotic production plans. With the help of the work team, they have established mutual aid organizations for production, and they have also decided to plant three or four mu of "high-yield experimental fields" this year to strive for a bumper harvest to welcome their future happy life. Xiangba, a farmer from Langru Creek, said with confidence: "A happy sun has risen in the sky, and a living Buddha—the Communist Party—has come to the earth. In our generation, a beautiful life is about to begin!"

As early as the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the working people of Tibet were very eager to carry out democratic reforms. Whether in the Himalayan Mountains, in the agricultural areas on both sides of the Yarlung Zangbo River, or in the vast rural areas west of the Jinsha River, wherever the work team of the People's Liberation Army went, Tibetan farmers complained to the work team about their painful lives that were worse than cattle and horses, behind the backs of the serf owners. They compared the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to "the sun in winter and the rain in summer," and asked about the policies and timing of the reform. In many places, serfs wrapped letters requesting reform in white hadas and sent them to local Party organizations of the Chinese Communist Party or the People's Liberation Army. The Jiangzi Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party received thirteen letters jointly written by farmers on the north bank of the Nianchu River. Many Tibetans compared usury, Ula (i.e., corvée), and personal tax to the three iron chains that lords and headmen used to bind their hands and feet. They said: If these iron chains are not cut off, our ancestors will not be able to stand up for generations. In Dongga Zong, near Lhasa, there is a folk song: "Aba Denzeng la! Please tell me, I have not seen a grain of food, how did it become a thousand dou of debt? Such suffering, such hatred, when will we see the light of day?" The origin of this folk song is as follows: In 1941, Denzeng, a serf in Dongga Zong, borrowed one ke of highland barley from the serf owner. When Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951, the serf owner insisted that he repay six hundred ke. Denzeng had no choice but to flee to other places. His wife was forced to death, and his seven-year-old orphan was even arrested by the serf owner to pay off the debt. After the orphan grew up, he secretly composed and sang this folk song, making a bloody accusation against the cannibalistic system. Many Tibetan farmers said a year ago: The People's Liberation Army has come, but only half of it has been liberated. Only with reform can it be truly liberated.

In April 1956, the words of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni to the Tibetan people at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region that Tibet must carry out democratic reforms and resolutely take the socialist road quickly spread throughout Tibet. People passed on the good news by riding horses, and various regions held meetings to warmly support it, believing that the good days they had yearned for generations were about to come. More than 100 farmers from Langzong and Dazong spontaneously gathered on July 18th and 19th. When a Tibetan farmer recounted his tragic life experience at the meeting, he said: "After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we enjoyed the rights of national equality, but we have not yet obtained true freedom. My family has six people, and we don't have a single piece of land. The whole family relies on me alone to maintain corvée. Despite working hard, we still can't eat enough or wear warm clothes. What is the reason for this? It's all because of the unreasonable old system." On July 25th, sixty-five farmers in the northern region of Lhasa jointly wrote a letter to the Dalai Lama. The letter stated: "We are all farmers who cultivate the land, and we are more anxiously looking forward to the implementation of reform than anyone else. When we heard that Tibet was going to implement reform, we really didn't know what words to use to describe the joy in our hearts. We support reform, and we demand that it be as soon as possible." These sixty-five farmers also pressed their handprints at the end of the letter.

However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique tried every possible means to obstruct and undermine this urgent desire for reform of the vast number of working people in Tibet. They adopted a hypocritical attitude towards the words of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni regarding the need to carry out democratic reforms and take the socialist road in the Tibetan region. The former Tibetan local government sent a large number of people to carry out deceptive propaganda to the masses, village by village and household by household. They said: "After the reform, the property will be confiscated by the Communist Party, and the grain will be taken away by the People's Liberation Army." They also threatened the farmers: "That person who demands reform and approaches the People's Liberation Army will have his nose cut off, his eyes gouged out, and his entire family will be wiped out."

In the eight years after the liberation of Tibet, when the serf system remained intact, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the staff members saw with their own eyes that the poor farmers in Tibet were in dire straits, and they had deep sympathy. When the soldiers and staff members went to the countryside to issue interest-free agricultural loans, they saw that the farmers had just received the white ocean (when Tibet issued interest-free agricultural loans, some silver dollars were issued), and then they were immediately snatched away by the serf owners. They saw the serfs being brutally tortured by the serf owners, and many farmers freezing and starving to death in the snow and at the village head. Many Han cadres and soldiers saved their own rations, took off the clothes on their bodies, and gave them to the poor Tibetans. At that time, the Central People's Government adopted a benevolent and righteous attitude towards these reactionary big serf owners, patiently waiting for their awakening, announced that reforms would not be carried out during the second five-year plan, and repeatedly explained and persuaded the masses. However, the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet remained stubborn, vainly attempting to maintain the darkest and most backward serf system forever and continue to ride on the heads of the people. On March 10th of this year, they colluded with foreign reactionaries and launched an armed rebellion that betrayed the motherland. This was the final struggle of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet. The outbreak and rapid suppression of this rebellion has opened up a new historical period for democratic reform in Tibet.

### 西藏百万农牧民迫切要求民主改革

　　摧毁反动的黑暗的野蛮的农奴制度　建设民主的幸福的社会主义新西藏
　　西藏百万农牧民迫切要求民主改革
　　高原上，世世代代受压迫的农奴歌颂着平叛的胜利：“天上升起了幸福的太阳，地上来了活菩萨——共产党，在我们这一代，美好的生活就要开始了！”
    新华社拉萨7日电　本社记者报道：西藏高原占西藏人口95％的一百一十多万农民、牧民，要求摧毁极其野蛮、残酷和黑暗的农奴制度，永远结束多年来受尽压迫奴役的悲惨生活，和全国各兄弟民族携手一道走向最幸福美满的社会。
    西藏上层反动集团发动的叛乱，目前基本上已经平定，这就使全西藏的劳动人民更加强烈地要求实行改革。最近在各地举行的群众平叛大会上，农民们在控诉叛乱分子的罪行的时候，纷纷提出：上层反动集团公开背叛了祖国，他们所坚持的农奴制度就不应该再继续保存下去！
    在拉萨、昌都、山南、江孜以及其他广大农村的贫苦的差巴、堆穷（都是农奴）和朗生（家奴），都向人民解放军和工作人员焦灼地打听：“什么时候解放（改革）？”、“噶厦和反动贵族把我们害苦了，什么时候开始改革？”他们纷纷向解放军哭诉亲身所受的痛苦，恳求共产党、解放军马上帮助他们翻身。因为忍受不了惨重压榨而逃到拉萨作临时短工的格桑达瓦控诉说：“我父亲因为负担太重而劳累死了，我交不起地租，支不起差，只得逃跑出来谋生。过去我们村子共有十几户人家，四处逃亡，现在只剩下几户了。旧制度逼得我们家破人亡。我要求赶快改革，使我们能够回到家乡去生产。”蔡宗的一个差巴（农奴）罗桑饶登对工作人员说：“旧制度不改革，我们农民活不下去了。”他诉说了自己祖孙三代的悲惨遭遇。他的祖父有一年因为家人患病，牲畜死亡，不得不向藏政府借了五十克（一克合二十五市斤）青稞。他原以为拼着全家人省吃俭用，总能还清债务。但是罗桑饶登的祖父到死也没有还清。罗桑饶登的父亲，接着干了一辈子，仍然没有还清。到罗桑饶登这一代，又过了二十多年，祖孙三代已经交出了大量粮食，直到今年三月原西藏地方政府发动叛乱时为止，五十克粮债不但没有还清，连本带利变成一千六百克了。罗桑饶登说：“高利贷就像无底的黑洞，掉进去就爬不出来，我们再也不能受这种罪了。”
    现在西藏的农村里，广大农民正怀着无限兴奋的心情来迎接他们新生后的第一次春耕。叛匪盘据和逃跑时，曾经对农村的生产进行了疯狂破坏，但农民们决心响应党的号召：不荒废一亩土地。蔡宗的农民们，还订出了爱国生产计划，他们在工作组的帮助下，建立了生产互助组织，并且还决定今年要种三、四亩“丰产试验田”，争取大丰收来迎接今后美满幸福的生活。朗如溪卡的农民向巴满怀信心地说：“天上升起了幸福的太阳，地上来了活菩萨——共产党，在我们这一代，美好的生活就要开始了！”
    早在西藏和平解放之日起，西藏劳动人民要求进行民主改革的心情就十分迫切。无论是在喜马拉雅山区，在雅鲁藏布江两岸的农业区，或是金沙江以西的广大农村，人民解放军工作队所到之处，藏族农民背着农奴主向工作队倾诉他们比牛马还不如的痛苦生活。他们把共产党、毛主席比做“冬天的太阳、夏天的雨”，奔走相问改革的政策和时间，许多地方的农奴用洁白的哈达卷着要求改革的信件送给中共地方党组织或人民解放军。中共江孜分工委就收到过十三封年楚河北岸农民联名写的信。许多藏民把高利贷、乌拉（即差役）和人役税，比做是领主和头人的三根铁链捆着他们的手脚。他们说：不把这几根铁链砍掉，祖祖辈辈都不能翻身。在拉萨附近的东噶宗，流传着一首歌谣：“阿爸登增啦！请你对我讲，我未见一粒粮，怎么变成千斗债，这样的苦，这样的恨，何日见青天？”这首歌谣的来历是这样的：1941年，东噶宗有个叫登增的农奴，向农奴主借了一克青稞，到1951年西藏和平解放时，农奴主硬要他还六百克，登增只得逃亡他乡，他的妻子被逼死了，七岁的孤儿竟被农奴主抓去抵债，这个孤儿长大以后，偷偷地编唱这首歌谣，对吃人制度作了血泪控诉。许多西藏农民在一年前还说：解放军来了，只解放了一半，只有改革了，才算真正解放。
    1956年4月，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上向西藏人民所讲的西藏必须进行民主改革和坚决走社会主义道路的话，很快传遍西藏各地，人们骑马传递喜讯，各个地区纷纷集会热烈拥护，以为世代向往的好日子就要到来了。朗宗和达宗的一百多个农民在这年7月18、19日分别自动集会，有个藏族农民在会上倾诉自己的悲苦身世时说：“西藏和平解放后，在共产党领导下，我们享受了民族平等的权利，但是我们还是没有得到真正的自由。我家六口人，没有一点土地，全家生活靠我一个人支差维持，尽管拼命劳动，结果还是吃不饱、穿不暖。这是什么原因？都是因为不合理的旧制度。”7月25日，拉萨北部地区有六十五个农民联名写信给达赖喇嘛。信上说：“我们都是种地的农民，比任何人都更焦急地盼望实行改革。我们听说西藏要实行改革，真不知用什么话来形容心里的高兴。我们拥护改革，并且要求越快越好。”这六十五个农民还在信末按下了手印。
    但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，对西藏广大劳苦群众的这种迫切期望改革的要求，千方百计地进行阻挠和破坏。他们对达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼关于在西藏地区必须进行民主改革、走社会主义道路的话，采取了阳奉阴违的态度。原西藏地方政府派出大批人员，逐村挨户对群众进行欺骗宣传，他们说：“改革以后财产都要被共产党没收，粮食就要被解放军抢走”。他们并且威吓农民群众说：“那个人要求改革、接近人民解放军，就要割鼻、挖眼，抄杀全家”。
    在西藏解放后八年来农奴制度原封未动的情况下，进藏人民解放军部队官兵和工作人员亲眼看到西藏贫苦农民处于水深火热之中，怀着深切的同情。战士们和工作人员下乡发放无息农贷时，看到农民一手刚接过白洋（西藏发放无息农贷时，一部分发银元），接着又被农奴主一把抢走。他们看到农奴们惨受农奴主的酷刑，不少农民在雪地和村头冻死、饿死的惨景。许多汉族干部和战士们省下自己的口粮，脱下自己身上的衣服，送给贫苦藏民。当时，中央人民政府对这些反动的大农奴主采取仁至义尽的态度，耐心等待他们的觉悟，宣布在第二个五年计划期间不进行改革，并且再三向群众进行解释说服。但是西藏上层反动集团却仍然执迷不悟，妄图永远保持最黑暗落后的农奴制度，继续骑在人民的头上。今年3月10日，他们竟然勾结外国反动派发动了背叛祖国的武装叛乱。这是西藏上层反动集团的最后的挣扎。这次叛乱的爆发和迅速平定，为西藏的民主改革开辟了一个新的历史时期。（附图片）
