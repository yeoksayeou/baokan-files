Xinhua News Agency, 30th - The delegation from the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, led by Johannes Dieckmann, President of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, and Hermann Matern, First Vice President, arrived in Beijing by plane from Hanoi this afternoon after visiting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed at the Capital Airport in the eastern suburbs by Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and other state leaders, as well as more than a thousand people.

Today, the eve of International Labor Day, a day when working people around the world review their strength, the distinguished guests from the homeland of Marx and Engels once again brought the fraternal friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic, who are at the Western front of the socialist camp, to the Chinese people, demonstrating the solid unity and great strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The national flags of China and Germany fluttered in the sky above the airport, and huge banners were hung on the buildings, with the words "Welcome the Delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic" written in Chinese and German. At 4 p.m., when President Dieckmann and First Vice President Matern stepped out of the cabin with smiles, the welcoming crowd burst into thunderous applause. Chairman Zhu De and other leaders stepped forward to shake hands with the distinguished guests one by one. A group of young women presented the distinguished guests with bouquets of colorful flowers.

Chairman Zhu De delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people (full text on page 2). He said that in the past few years, the relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Germany in the fields of politics, economy, culture, and science and technology have greatly developed. The visit of the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to our country this time will further enhance the close friendship between our two countries.

President Dieckmann delivered an enthusiastic speech amid applause (full text on page 2). In his speech, he first conveyed the greetings of the people of the German Democratic Republic to the Chinese people. He said that we are very happy to be able to gather with you. The visit of the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic to China is of great significance. This is the first time in the history of German-Chinese relations that a delegation of the People's Chamber has visited your country. This time, we will exchange views with the Chinese leaders on issues of common concern.

Those who welcomed the delegation at the airport today included: Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Saifudin, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation were Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Shutong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and others.

Also present to welcome the delegation were the heads of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, heads of various people's organizations, democratic parties, and the Sino-German Friendship Association.

Wang Daiel, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, and embassy staff went to the airport to greet the delegation. Diplomats and officials from the embassies of Vietnam, North Korea, Mongolia, India, and Ceylon in China also went to the airport to welcome the delegation today.

Chairman Zhu De accompanied President Dieckmann and First Vice President Matern around the airport to meet the welcoming crowd. More than three months ago, the people of the capital warmly welcomed Premier Grotewohl at this airport. Today, when they once again welcomed the envoys of the people of the German Democratic Republic, people were particularly excited. Bouquets of flowers waved in the crowd, and amid cheers, applause, and the sound of gongs and drums, people presented bunches of flowers to President Dieckmann and Vice President Matern, and shouted: "Long live Sino-German friendship!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live world peace!"

The distinguished guests passed through Wuhan today. NPC representative Qu Wu went to Wuhan to welcome them and accompanied them to Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, held a banquet at Ziguang Pavilion in Zhongnanhai this evening to warmly welcome Johannes Dieckmann, President of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, First Vice President Hermann Matern, and the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic led by them.

At the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to warmly congratulate the continuous development of the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany, the greater achievements in the socialist construction of the two countries, and the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Chairman Zhu De spoke first at the banquet (see page 2). In his speech, he praised the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction and its contributions to the cause of maintaining world peace.

Chairman Zhu De said that in order to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly put forward proposals conducive to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, promoting the rapprochement of the two Germanys, and the establishment of a confederation, and actively supported the Soviet Union's proposals on the peaceful settlement of the German question. Not long ago, the Soviet government, in line with its consistent position of maintaining peace, once again proposed ending the occupation of West Berlin, convening a peace conference, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and holding a summit meeting between the East and the West. The Chinese people warmly support and fully support these reasonable proposals of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. However, the imperialist group headed by the United States and the reactionary ruling group of West Germany are doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the peaceful settlement of the German question. We can be sure that the imperialist policy of splitting Germany and maintaining the occupation of West Berlin will eventually suffer a shameful defeat. Final victory must belong to the great German people.

In his speech, Chairman Zhu De expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the German Democratic Republic for its multifaceted assistance to our socialist construction.

First Vice President Matern then spoke. (see page 2) In his speech, he said enthusiastically that we, like you, are happy and proud of the great achievements you have made in the Great Leap Forward last year.

Matern said that concluding a peace treaty with Germany on the basis of the Soviet Union's proposal would restrain German militarism and create a decisive prerequisite for the peaceful and democratic reunification of the two Germanys. This would also greatly ease the tense situation in Europe. Therefore, the German people strongly demand that the upcoming Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, with representatives from the two Germanys participating, make such a decision: that is, to immediately convene a summit meeting and a peace conference to sign a peace treaty with Germany. Although all these proposals are reasonable and realistic and conform to the interests of all peace-loving people, they are still rejected by the Bonn militarists and Adenauer.

Matern said with full confidence that in today's international situation, where tremendous changes have taken place and the forces of peace are growing stronger, there is no doubt that the German people will be the victors in this struggle.

Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Saifudin, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the banquet.

Also attending the banquet were Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Shutong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and others.

Also attending the banquet were the heads of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, heads of various people's organizations, democratic parties, and the Sino-German Friendship Association.

Wang Daiel, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, was invited to attend the banquet. (Photo attached)

    在共同斗争中永远相互支持　中德友谊万古长青
    德人民议院代表团到京
    朱德委员长到机场迎接　晚间盛宴欢迎贵宾
    新华社30日讯　由德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼和第一副主席赫尔曼·马特恩率领的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团，在访问越南民主共和国以后，今天下午乘飞机由河内到达北京。贵宾们在东郊首都机场，受到全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德等国家领导人，以及一千多群众的热烈欢迎。
    今天——“五一”国际劳动节的前夕。在这个全世界劳动人民检阅自己力量的日子里，来自马克思、恩格斯故乡的贵宾们，向中国人民再一次带来了处在社会主义阵营西方前线的德意志民主共和国人民的兄弟情谊，显示了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚固团结和巨大的力量。
    机场上空，中德两国国旗迎风飘扬，建筑物上高悬巨大横幅，上面用中、德文写道：“欢迎德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团”。四时，当狄克曼主席和马特恩第一副主席含笑步出机舱时，欢迎队伍顿时发出春雷般的掌声。朱德委员长等领导人迎上前去同贵宾们一一亲切握手。一群女青年向贵宾们献了鲜艳的花束。
    朱德委员长代表人大常委会和中国人民致欢迎词。（全文登在第二版）他说，几年以来，中德两国在政治、经济、文化和科学技术等方面的互助合作关系有了很大的发展。德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团这次前来我国访问，将进一步增进我们两国之间的亲密友谊。
    狄克曼主席在一片掌声中发表了热情的讲话，（全文登在第二版）他在讲话中首先转达了德意志民主共和国人民对中国人民的问候。他说，我们能够和你们聚会感到很高兴。德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团这次来中国访问是有很重大的意义。人民议院代表团访问你们国家，这在德中关系的历史上还是第一次。这次我们将同中国的领导人就我们共同关心的问题交换意见。
    今天到机场欢迎的有：人大常委会副委员长林伯渠、李济深、黄炎培、赛福鼎、林枫。
    前往机场欢迎的还有国务院副总理聂荣臻，政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等。
    前往欢迎的，还有最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的负责人，各人民团体、各民主党派以及中德友好协会的负责人。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔和使馆人员前往机场迎接。越南、朝鲜、蒙古、印度、锡兰的驻华使节和大使馆的外交官员，今天也到机场欢迎。
    朱德委员长陪同狄克曼主席和马特恩第一副主席绕场一周，同欢迎群众见面。三个多月以前，首都群众在这个机场上曾经热烈欢迎过格罗提渥总理，今天当他们再次欢迎德意志民主共和国的人民使者的时候，人们心情格外兴奋。群众队伍中花束挥舞，在一片欢呼声、鼓掌声和锣鼓声中，人们把一束又一束的鲜花献给狄克曼主席和马特恩副主席，并且高呼：“中德友好万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    贵宾们今天曾经经过武汉，人大代表屈武前往武汉迎接，并且陪同贵宾们到达北京。
    新华社30日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德今天晚间在中南海紫光阁举行宴会，热烈欢迎德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、第一副主席马特恩以及由他们率领的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团。
    在充满一片友好气氛的宴会
  上，宾主一再举杯，为中德两国人民兄弟友谊的不断发展，为两国社会主义建设取得更加辉煌的成就，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的伟大团结，表示热烈的祝贺。
    朱德委员长在宴会上首先讲话，（见第二版）他在讲话中赞扬德意志民主共和国在社会主义建设中的成就和在维护世界和平事业中的贡献。
    朱德委员长说，为了争取实现祖国的和平统一，德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府一再提出有利于缔结对德和约、促进两个德国接近和建立邦联的建议，积极支持苏联关于和平解决德国问题的主张。不久前，苏联政府本着一贯维护和平的立场，再次提出结束西柏林占领状态、召开和会、缔结对德和约、举行东西方最高级会议等建议。中国人民热烈拥护并且全力支持德意志民主共和国和苏联这些合情合理的建议。但是以美国为首的帝国主义集团和西德反动统治集团却千方百计地阻挠和破坏德国问题的和平解决。我们可以肯定，帝国主义分裂德国和保持西柏林占领状态的政策最后必然会遭受可耻的失败。最后胜利一定属于伟大的德意志人民。
    朱德委员长在讲话中对德意志民主共和国给我国社会主义建设的多方面的援助，表示衷心的感谢。
    马特恩第一副主席接着讲话。
  （见第二版）他在讲话中热情地说，我们和你们一样，对你们去年大跃进中取得的伟大成就感到高兴和骄傲。
    马特恩说，在苏联的建议基础上签订对德和约，这样会约制德国军国主义并且为两个德国的和平和民主的重新统一创造决定性的前题。这样也会使欧洲紧张局势大大缓和。因此德国人民强烈要求即将召开的有两个德国派代表参加的日内瓦四大国外长会议作出这样的决议：即随即召开最高首脑会议和签订对德和约的和平会议。虽然所有这些建议是合理的现实的，并且符合一切爱好和平的人民的利益，可是这些建议仍旧被波恩军国主义分子和阿登纳拒绝了。
    马特恩满怀信心地说，在国际局势起了巨大的变化，和平力量日益强大的今天，毫无疑问，德国人民将会是这次斗争的胜利者。
    人大常委会副委员长林伯渠、李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、彭真、赛福鼎、林枫出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的有国务院副总理聂荣臻，政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等。
    出席宴会的，还有最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的负责人，各人民团体、各民主党派以及中德友好协会的负责人。
