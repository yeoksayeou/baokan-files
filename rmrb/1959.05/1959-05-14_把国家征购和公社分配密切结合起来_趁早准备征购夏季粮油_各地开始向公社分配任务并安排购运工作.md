Xinhua News Agency, 13th: This year, the nation's summer grain crops are generally growing well, and rapeseed is also laden with pods, promising a good harvest. In order to ensure the growing needs of urban and rural markets for grain and oil, various localities have begun actively preparing for the summer grain and oil procurement.

The characteristics of this year's summer grain procurement work are full preparation and early action. At present, major wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Sichuan, Anhui, and Shaanxi have all made arrangements for summer grain procurement. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of secretaries of the prefectural committees and directors of the special zone grain bureaus in mid-April to study the summer grain procurement work, and the summer grain procurement tasks have now been assigned to the production teams. In order to ensure that the summer grain procurement work is realistic and reasonable, the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau requires the grain bureaus of each county to conduct a pilot project to ascertain the yield of summer grain and to verify the yield by means of inter-commune and inter-team joint assessment during the summer grain harvest. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee has also convened meetings in various areas to arrange for summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer grain procurement. At present, the procurement tasks have been assigned to the counties and have begun to be distributed to the communes. Major rapeseed-producing areas such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi have also made arrangements for the purchase and processing of rapeseed.

When arranging this year's summer grain procurement work, all localities have emphasized the need to closely integrate the state's grain and oil procurement with the internal grain distribution of the communes, so as to both complete the state's procurement tasks and assist the people's communes and production teams in doing a good job in grain distribution. Regarding procurement methods, various localities have learned from last year's experience and are prepared to concentrate sufficient labor after the summer grain and rapeseed are mature, arrange a certain amount of time to carry out a concentrated effort for purchase, procurement, and transportation.

Local grain departments have also made a series of preparations in terms of personnel allocation, establishment of purchasing stations, and packaging and processing. According to the requirements of "zoning, fixed-point, and on-site pressing and purchasing," Wenjiang Special Zone in Sichuan Province has arranged more than 420 rapeseed purchasing stations, formed a purchasing team of more than 2,000 people, and set up the purchasing stations near oil pressing factories (workshops) or warehouses to save transportation power and time. Grain departments in many regions have prepared warehouses for the storage of summer grain and rapeseed. The oil procurement department of Jintang County, Sichuan Province, has prepared warehouses that can hold 6 million jin of rapeseed, with a capacity equivalent to more than 90% of the total amount of rapeseed to be purchased in the province this year. These warehouses have been sorted out, cleaned, and disinfected. Many oil pressing factories and workshops are vigorously carrying out technical innovation campaigns, deciding to greatly increase the daily output of each oil press in the second quarter to complete the rapeseed processing task faster and better.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 13th: The small spring harvest season in Sichuan Province has arrived, and the local grain and commercial departments are working intensively to start the purchase of wheat and rapeseed in accordance with the spirit of "grasping early, grasping tightly, and grasping carefully." As of early May, the province has purchased more than 9,760,000 jin of rapeseed.

In order to do a good job in the purchase of small spring crops this year, the relevant departments in Sichuan Province have successively held three telephone conferences since April to check and arrange the purchase work. Party committees in many areas have strengthened their leadership over the procurement of agricultural products. Commissioners and county heads have personally taken command, taking the completion of the small spring agricultural product procurement task as the main content of the red flag movement currently being carried out by the commercial departments. In early April, the Longchang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a financial and trade work conference attended by cadres at all levels of the communes and commercial departments, made specific arrangements for the rapeseed procurement work, and distributed it level by level to the management areas and production teams, while the commercial departments also distributed the plans to the supply and marketing cooperatives and distribution stores of the people's communes and production brigades so that the tasks were implemented to the grassroots units. Before the procurement, the staff of the commercial department of this county also went deep into the management areas and production teams to help with production while carrying out publicity and education on the procurement policy. Therefore, in just ten days, 30.6% of the annual rapeseed procurement task was completed.

While seizing the procurement work, various localities have also made a series of preparations for warehousing, storage and processing. Nanchong, Wenjiang, Neijiang, and other places have adjusted and disinfected the granaries. Many granaries scattered in various communes have also been renovated and inspected, preparing to welcome the new grain into the warehouses.

    把国家征购和公社分配密切结合起来
    趁早准备征购夏季粮油
    各地开始向公社分配任务并安排购运工作
    新华社13日讯  今年全国夏收粮食作物一般都生长良好，油菜也已结荚累累，丰收在望。各地为了保证城乡市场对粮食和油脂日益增长的需要，已经开始积极进行夏季粮、油征购的准备工作。
  准备充分、动手早，是今年夏粮征购工作的特点。目前，河南、山东、河北、四川、安徽、陕西等小麦主要产区都对夏粮征购工作作了布置。中共安徽省委早在4月中旬就召开了地委书记和专区粮食局长会议，研究夏粮征购工作，现在已经把夏粮征购任务分配到生产队了。河北省粮食厅为了使夏粮征购工作做到实事求是、征购合理，要求各县粮食局都搞一个试点，摸清夏季粮食的产量，并在夏粮收割时，采取社与社、队与队之间联评的方法，核实产量。陕西省人民委员会也已分片召开会议，布置了夏收夏种和夏粮征购工作，目前征购任务已下达到县，并开始向公社分配。四川、云南、贵州、湖南、江西等主要油菜产区对油菜籽的收购、加工也分别作了部署。
    各地在布置今年夏粮征购工作的时候，都强调要把国家的粮油征购和公社内部的粮食分配密切结合起来，既要完成国家的征购任务，又要协助人民公社和生产队做好粮食分配工作。对于征购方法，各地吸取去年的经验，准备在夏粮和油菜成熟以后，集中足够的劳动力，安排一定的时间，进行突击收购、征购和运送工作。
    各地粮食部门在人员配备、收购点的设置以及包装、加工等方面也进行了一系列准备工作。四川温江专区根据“分片定点、就榨收购”的要求，安排了四百二十多个油菜籽的收购点，组成了二千多人的收购队伍，并将收购点设在榨油厂（坊）或仓库附近，以节省运输力量和时间。许多地区粮食部门已经为夏粮和菜籽入库准备好了仓库。四川省金堂县油脂收购部门已经准备好可容纳六百万斤菜籽的仓库，容纳量相当全省今年将收购的菜籽总量90％以上，这些仓房都进行了整理、清扫和消毒工作。不少地区的榨油厂和榨坊，正在大力开展技术革新运动，决定在第二季度把每台榨机的日产量大大提高一步，更快更好地完成油菜籽加工任务。
    新华社成都13日电  四川省小春收获季节已经到来，各地粮食、商业部门按照“抓早、抓紧、抓细”的精神，紧张地展开了小麦、菜籽的收购工作。截至5月上旬，全省收购的菜籽已达九百七十六万多斤。
    为了做好今年小春作物的收购工作，四川省有关部门4月份以来曾先后召开了三次电话会议，检查布置收购工作。许多地区的党委都加强了农产品采购工作的领导，各地专员、县长都亲自挂帅，把完成小春农产品收购任务作为当前商业部门开展红旗运动的主要内容。中共隆昌县委在4月初就召开了公社、商业部门各级干部参加的财贸工作会议，对菜籽收购工作作了具体部署，并逐级下达到各管理区、生产队。同时，商业部门也把计划下达到人民公社和生产大队的供销部和分销店。使任务落实到基层单位。收购之前，这个县的商业部门工作人员还深入到管理区、生产队，一边帮助生产，一边展开收购政策的宣传教育，因此在短短的十天内，就完成了全年菜籽收购任务的30.6％。
    各地在抓紧收购工作的同时，对仓储保管和加工工作也作了一系列的准备。南充、温江、内江等地，都对粮仓进行了调整、消毒；许多分散在各公社的粮仓也进行了整修、检查，准备迎接新粮入仓。
