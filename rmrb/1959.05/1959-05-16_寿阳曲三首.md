    Three Songs of Shouchun Melody
    Zhao Puchu
    --Attempted to imitate a Yuan Dynasty short verse during the flight from Beijing to Moscow on May 5th.

      With wings touching the sky, bearing the morning sun, at 9,000 meters above the ground.
      Snow-like white clouds resemble an ocean, once again riding the wind and waves.
      Reporting sub-zero, fifty degrees, glad that we overcome the cold at high altitude①.
      Watching the scales of ice melt on Lake Baikal, knowing that spring has come to Mongolia.
      A good rest, a new world, frequent encouragement to eat more with earnest intentions.
      Fifteen hundred miles per hour, even flying to the end is still within one family②.

  ①The outside temperature of the aircraft cabin is minus fifty degrees, while inside the cabin it is twenty degrees above zero.
  ②Landed at Omsk Airport for a short break, and the comrades at the airport station were warmly treated with a sumptuous meal by the Soviet Peace Committee.

    寿阳曲三首
    赵朴初
    ——五月五日由北京飞莫斯科途
      中试拟元人小令
      中试拟元人小令垂天翼，负朝阳，九千公尺高空上。雪一般白云儿似海洋，又一次乘风破浪。报零下，五十度，喜我辈胜寒高处①。看鳞鳞冰解贝加尔湖，知春意已来蒙古。好歇息，新天地，加餐频劝殷勤意。一小时一千五百里，飞到头还在一家里②。
  ①机舱外高空气温零下五十度，舱内零上二十度。
  ②降鄂木斯克机场小憩，航空站工作同志受苏联和平委员会备盛馔殷勤款待。
