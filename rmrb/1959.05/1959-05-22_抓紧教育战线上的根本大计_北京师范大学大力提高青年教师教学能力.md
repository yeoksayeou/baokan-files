Grasp the Fundamental Plan on the Education Front
Beijing Normal University Vigorously Improves the Teaching Ability of Young Teachers

(Our report) Beijing Normal University has adopted active measures and is systematically improving the political and professional level of young teachers, achieving good results.

Since the beginning of this semester, Beijing Normal University has been actively leveraging the academic expertise of older teachers while vigorously training and improving young teachers, helping them to lecture in class. A large number of young teachers have improved their teaching abilities through teaching practice and planned advanced studies. Currently, more than 130 of the school's 400-plus young teachers are teaching courses. Young teachers are teaching more than 50 courses, including new courses this semester such as "Probability Theory" in the Mathematics Department. A large number of young teachers are also working in cooperation with older teachers, taking on the tasks of guiding student experiments, teaching, tutoring, and scientific research. Young teachers who have already begun teaching prepare their lessons very carefully. They are able to humbly learn from older teachers, delve into the student body, and continuously improve their teaching methods and absorb new scientific knowledge to enrich the teaching content according to the students' situation and needs. As a result, most young teachers' lectures are welcomed by students. For example, Huang Zhen, a young teacher in the Physics Department, revised her lecture notes repeatedly after she started teaching Astronomy this semester, and often sought advice and trial lectures from older teachers and some students. Her teaching level has continuously improved, and now she teaches astronomy courses not only to the Physics Department but also to the Geography Department.

In order to adapt to the new situation of continuous revolution in education and truly improve teaching quality, the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University regards cultivating and improving teachers and building a team of teachers who are both red and expert as a fundamental plan. In particular, young teachers have relatively poor knowledge and insufficient teaching experience, so it is urgent to train them in a planned way. However, given the heavy teaching tasks currently, the main contradiction between teaching and training is insufficient time. To solve this problem, the university has adopted the principle of combining improved current teaching quality with training and improvement, arranging a certain amount of time for young teachers to pursue advanced studies, based on the different circumstances of each major. In addition, they have a certain amount of time each week to study political theory and current affairs policies, and participate in labor training.

In terms of specific methods, young teachers are assigned to teach part or all of a course, depending on their individual circumstances. Leading cadres from the Party Committee, general branches, and branches also frequently attend young teachers' lectures to help them study and improve their teaching. Special attention is also paid to combining teaching with a variety of ways to exchange and summarize teaching experiences to improve the level of young teachers. The Chinese Department also frequently holds observation classes, with the general branch secretary and older teachers attending. Evaluation meetings are held after class, and young teachers are helped to summarize their teaching work, which has been very effective in improving their teaching level. In order to adapt to the future development of teaching, the Mathematics Department has also established "discussion classes" on probability theory, advanced algebra, etc. These are led by teachers who have already started teaching and guide young teachers to discuss and study, with three activities each week, which is of great help to the improvement of young teachers.

Leveraging the academic expertise of older teachers and organizing older and experienced teachers to guide new teachers is an important method for rapidly improving the teaching level of young teachers. Some departments also use the "one ring within another" method, with older teachers and those with expertise helping one another, layer by layer. Zhang Herui, an older teacher in the Mathematics Department, led a group of young teachers in studying advanced algebra, with discussions three times a week, which greatly helped the young teachers. The older teachers also help the new teachers prepare lessons in a deep and detailed manner, review lecture notes, and take time to attend their classes to help them improve their current teaching work. To help young teachers lay a broad foundation of knowledge, older teachers also provide them with basic courses and foreign languages. In order to help young teachers and students improve their ability to read classical literature and enrich their knowledge, the Chinese Department has offered two courses this semester taught by older teachers: "Selections of Literary Criticism from Past Dynasties" and "How to Use Reference Books," and many young teachers have participated in the study.

In addition to generally paying attention to organizing young teachers to pursue advanced studies in their spare time, some departments with more abundant teaching staff, starting from the needs of future teaching development, also plan to temporarily reduce the teaching tasks of a small number of young teachers, giving them more time to steadily read more books and conduct scientific research, and rotating them with other young teachers after a certain period. They also generally organize young teachers to conduct scientific research work in conjunction with teaching in order to improve their academic level. Some departments also plan to select a small number of young teachers to participate in the practical work of scientific or production departments for a short period of time, entrusting these departments to teach these young people urgently needed professional knowledge in a certain area so that it can be applied in future teaching.

    抓紧教育战线上的根本大计
    北京师范大学大力提高青年教师教学能力
    本报讯　北京师范大学采取了积极措施，有计划地提高青年教师的政治和业务水平，收到良好的成效。
    这学期来，北京师范大学一面积极发挥老教师的学术专长，一面大力培养和提高青年教师，帮助他们上台讲课。大批青年教师通过教学实践和有计划的进修，教学工作能力有了提高。现在，这个学校的四百多名青年教师中，已有一百三十多人开了课。青年教师所开的课程有五十多门，其中如数学系“概率论”等，还是这学期来新开的课程。还有大批青年教师和老教师团结合作，担任指导学生实验、教学、辅导和科学研究的工作。已经开了课的青年教师备课都非常认真，他们能虚心向老教师学习，能深入学生中去，并能根据学生的情况和需要，不断改进教学方法和吸收新的科学知识来充实教学内容，因而，多数青年教师讲课都受到学生们欢迎。如物理系青年教师黄桢，这学期开了天文学课后，她每次的讲稿都经过反复修改，并经常找老教师和一些学生研究和试讲，教学水平不断提高，现在她除了担任物理系的天文学课外，还担任了地理系的天文学课。
    为了适应教育工作不断革命的新形势，真正地提高教学质量，北京师范大学党委把培养提高师资，建设一支又红又专的教师队伍作为根本大计。特别是青年教师，知识水平较差，教学经验不足，有计划地进行培养就成为迫切的问题。但是，在当前教学任务繁重的情况下，教学和培养提高的主要矛盾是时间不足。为了解决这个问题，根据各专业的不同情况，采取既提高当前教学质量又能培养提高相结合的原则，安排青年教师一定的进修时间。此外，每周有一定的时间学习政治理论和时事政策，参加劳动锻炼。
    在具体作法上，根据青年教师的不同情况让他们担任一门课的部分或全部教学任务。党委、各总支、支部领导干部还常去听青年教师讲课，帮助他们研究改进教学。并特别注意结合教学，采取多种多样交流和总结教学经验的办法，提高青年教师的水平。中文系还经常举行观摩教学，总支书记、老教师都去听课，课后开评议会，以及帮助青年教师总结教学工作，对提高青年教师的教学水平都收到很好的效果。为了适应今后教学的发展，数学系还成立概率论、高等代数等“讨论班”。由已开课的教师主持讲解，带动青年教师讨论学习，每周有三次活动，对青年教师的提高也有很大帮助。
    发挥老教师的学术专长，组织老教师和有经验的教师带新教师，是迅速提高青年教师教学水平的重要方法。有的系还以“一环套一环”的办法，由老教师、能者一个带一个，一层带一层进行帮助。数学系老教师张禾瑞带领一批青年教师研究高等代数，每周讨论三次，对青年教师帮助很大。老教师们还深入、细致地帮助新教师备课、审阅讲稿，抽空去听他们的课，帮助他们改进当前教学工作。为了帮助青年教师打下广泛的知识基础，老教师们还为他们补基础课和外文等。中文系为了帮助青年教师和学生提高对古典文学的阅读能力，丰富知识，这学期，由老教师们开了“历代文学批评论文选”和“工具备书使用法”两门课，许多青年教师都参加了学习。
    各系除普遍注意组织青年教师利用业余时间进修外，从今后教学发展需要出发，一些师资力量较充足的系，还有计划地让少数青年教师暂时少担任教学任务，给他更多时间踏踏实实地多读些书和进行科学研究，一定时期后与其他青年教师轮换。他们还普遍组织青年教师结合教学进行科学研究工作，以提高他们的学术水平。有的系还有计划地抽出少数青年教师短期参加科学部门或生产部门的实际工作，委托这些部门教给这些青年某一方面急需的专业知识，以便在今后教学中应用。（附图片）
