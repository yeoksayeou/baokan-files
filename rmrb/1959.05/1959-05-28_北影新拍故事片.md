    The Beijing Film Studio is currently shooting color feature films adapted from the novels "Red Flag Ballad," "Song of Youth," "My Family," and the drama "Red Storm."

    The Beijing Film Studio is currently producing a total of nine feature films, one more than the total number of feature films produced by the studio last year. In addition to "Red Flag Ballad," "Song of Youth," "My Family," and "Red Storm," there is also the wide-screen film "Long Live the Red Army," co-produced with the August First Film Studio, as well as "Miner's Lamp," produced solely by this studio, reflecting the different lives of coal miners before and after liberation; "Nameless Island," with the theme of the People's Liberation Army Navy sinking Chiang Kai-shek's military vessels on the Fujian front; "Flying Over the Natural Barrier," depicting the People's Air Force breaking the Kangzang "airspace exclusion zone" and opening the Beijing-Lhasa air route; and "The Lin Family Shop," a feature film adapted from Mao Dun's novel of the same name. Except for "Miner's Lamp," which is both black and white and color, the rest are all color films.

    北影新拍故事片
    北京电影制片厂正拍摄由“红旗谱”、“青春之歌”、“我的一家”这几部小说和话剧“红色风暴”改编的彩色故事影片。
    北京电影制片厂正在拍摄的故事片共有九部，比去年这个厂全年生产的故事片还多一部。其中除“红旗谱”、“青春之歌”、“我的一家”、“红色风暴”外，还有同八一电影制片厂合拍的宽银幕片“红军万岁”，以及这个厂单独拍制的反映解放前后煤矿工人不同生活的“矿灯”；以人民解放军海军在福建前线击沉蒋军军舰为主题的“无名岛”和描写人民空军打破康藏“空中禁区”开辟北京——拉萨航线的“飞越天险”、根据茅盾同名小说改拍的故事片“林家铺子”等。其中除“矿灯”是黑白兼彩色片外，其余都是彩色片。
