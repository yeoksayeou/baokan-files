Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: Capital's cultural and scientific circles held commemorative meetings today to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of world cultural figure Robert Burns and the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin. Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, delivered the opening speech, saying: The works of Burns, the famous Scottish peasant poet, and the Darwinian theory of the great British natural scientist, were introduced to China decades ago, and more Chinese translations of their works have appeared in recent years. Burns used poetry as a sharp weapon to satirize the ruling class of the time, becoming the bugler for the working people of Scotland. Darwin's theory shook the dominance of the idealistic world view over people's minds and established a historical and materialistic viewpoint in biological theories. They have made very valuable contributions to human culture and are therefore respected by the Chinese people.
    Wang Zuoliang, Director of the English Department of Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, Bing Zhi, President of the Chinese Zoological Society, and Zheng Zuoxin, Secretary-General, introduced Burns' and Darwin's life stories and achievements at the meeting, respectively. Wang Zuoliang said that Robert Burns is one of the greatest poets in British and world literary history. He wrote about topics of concern to the working people in forms that were popular with them. Most of his works were written in the Scottish dialect, and he compiled and rewrote about three hundred folk songs, preserving many folk songs that were about to be lost. Wang Zuoliang analyzed and introduced Burns' famous poems "Scots Wha Hae," "A Man's a Man for A' That," "The Tree of Liberty," and "Auld Lang Syne."
    Zheng Zuoxin and Bing Zhi introduced Darwin's achievements, saying: Darwin's theory of biological evolution is the foundation of Michurin's biology and a symbol of progressive biology. It has become a valuable asset of the working people of the world. We must learn from Darwin's tireless work ethic and scientific attitude, and even more so, learn from Soviet scientists to creatively apply Darwin's theory to agricultural production and medical practice.
    The commemorative meeting was jointly organized by The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, The China Association for Science and Technology, The Chinese Writers Association, and The Beijing Association for Science and Technology. Among those who attended today's commemorative meeting were well-known figures from cultural and scientific circles, including Hu Yuzhi, Tian Han, Ding Ying, Zang Kejia, and Qian Chongshu. Cultural officials from various embassies in China were also invited to attend the meeting. Works by Burns and Chinese folk songs were recited and sung at the meeting, and the film "The Origin of Life," based on Darwin's theory, was also screened.
    To commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns and the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin, the Beijing Library is holding an exhibition starting today, displaying more than 200 Chinese and foreign language versions of the works of the two world cultural figures.

    纪念世界文化名人彭斯和达尔文
    首都文化科学界举行纪念会
    新华社27日讯  首都文化科学界，今天举行了世界文化名人罗伯特·彭斯诞生二百周年、查理·达尔文诞生一百五十周年纪念会。中国人民对外文化协会副会长、中华人民共和国科学技术协会副主席丁西林致开幕词说：数十年前苏格兰著名农民诗人彭斯的作品和英国伟大自然科学家达尔文学说就被介绍到中国，近年来他们的作品的中译本更多了。彭斯运用了诗歌这一锐利武器讽刺当时的统治阶级，成为当时苏格兰劳动人民的号手。达尔文的学说震撼了唯心主义世界观对人民思想的统治地位，在生物学说中建立了历史观点和唯物观点。他们对人类文化都有着十分宝贵的贡献，因而得到中国人民的敬重。
    北京外国语学院英文系主任王佐良、中国动物学会理事长秉志和秘书长郑作新在会上分别介绍了彭斯和达尔文的生平与成就。王佐良说，罗伯特·彭斯是英国和世界文学史上最伟大的诗人之一，他用劳动人民喜闻乐见的形式写出劳动人民所关心的题材，他的大部分作品都是用苏格兰乡土方言写成的，并整理改写了约三百首民间口头传诵的歌谣，把许多将要失传的民歌保存了下来。王佐良分析介绍了彭斯的名诗“苏格兰人”、“不管那一套”、“自由树”、“大好年华”等。
    郑作新、秉志先后介绍达尔文的成就说：达尔文创立的生物进化学说是米丘林生物学的基础，是进步生物学的标志，它已成为世界劳动人民的宝贵财富。我们要学习达尔文孜孜不倦的工作精神和科学态度，更要向苏联科学家学习，把达尔文学说创造性地运用到农业生产和医学实践中去。
    纪念会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中华人民共和国科学技术协会、中国作家协会、北京市科学技术协会联合举办的。参加今天纪念会的还有文化科学界著名人士胡愈之、田汉、丁颖、臧克家、钱崇澍等。各国驻华使馆文化官员也应邀出席了纪念会。会上朗诵和演唱了彭斯的作品和中国民歌，还放映了根据达尔文学说拍摄的电影“生物的起源”。
    北京图书馆为纪念罗伯特·彭斯诞生二百周年和查理·达尔文诞生一百五十周年，今天起举办展览会，展出两位世界文化名人著作的中外文版本二百多种。
