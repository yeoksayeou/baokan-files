Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: According to the Indian Information Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking at a mass meeting attended by 100,000 people at the Gandhi Maidan in Patna on April 30th, said regarding domestic construction issues, "The wheel of progress is moving forward, and no matter what happens, that movement will not stop. We will continue on our path forward."

Nehru said that, clearly, India has not yet eliminated poverty. The need today is to increase the production of wealth. Gold and silver are not wealth. Wealth is produced in factories and fields. Nehru said that the lessons of other countries' achievements should be learned, while also considering India's specific conditions. Only by producing more and more wealth can poverty be eliminated. When discussing how to eradicate poverty, he said that people might say that the rich should not exist, but the problem is that people cannot benefit simply from eliminating the rich. Some differences will exist, and the goal is not to distribute poverty but to distribute wealth. Those who help produce wealth should receive their due labor compensation. Only through hard work, utilizing the power of nature and scientific knowledge, can wealth be produced. This goal cannot be achieved solely by shouting slogans.

Nehru said that India is moving towards progress. Some things have been completed, some are in progress, and future plans are also being formulated. The fact is that India's limbs are actively moving. However, he believes that some things that are in progress are not proceeding at the desired high speed.

He believes that steel plants and heavy machinery manufacturing plants are very necessary for the progress of the country, even though the profits that investment can immediately generate do not appear to be as much as the profits generated by investing funds in smaller industries.

Nehru also said that India can only progress if the villages become strong and prosperous. He believes that more power should be given to village councils.

Nehru said that farmers with very little land cannot hope to produce more. If they voluntarily unite for cooperative farming, they would be much better off. He emphasized that the suggestion of cooperative farming was never intended to abolish their ownership of land. Nor will people be forced to engage in cooperative farming.

　　尼赫鲁谈印度国内建设问题
    新华社8日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁4月30日在巴特那的甘地迈丹有十万人参加的一次大会上谈到国内建设问题时说，“进步的车轮正在向前移动，不管发生什么事情，那个运动是不会停止的。我们将继续我们前进的路程。”
    尼赫鲁说，显然，印度还没有消除贫穷。今天的需要就是增加生产财富。黄金和白银不是财富。财富是在工厂和田野里生产出来的。尼赫鲁说，应该学习其他国家取得成就的经验教训，同时又要考虑印度的具体条件。只有生产更多更多的财富才能消除贫困。他在谈到如何消灭贫穷时说，人们很可以说，富人不应该存在，但是问题是，人们不可能单单从消除富人中得到好处。某些差别将要存在，目的不是分配贫穷而是分配财富。帮助生产财富的人应该得到他应有的劳动报酬。只有努力工作，利用自然的力量和科学知识，才能生产财富。这个目的是不可单靠喊口号来达到的。
    尼赫鲁说，印度正在向进步前进，有些事情已经完成，有些事情正在进行，将来的计划也正在制订。事实是，印度的四肢正在积极地运动。但是，他认为某些正在进行的事情并不是以所希望的高速度在进行。
    他认为，钢铁厂和重型机械制造厂对国家的进步是非常必要的，虽然，投资所能立即产生的利润，看上去没有资金投在较小的工业方面所产生的利润那么多。
    尼赫鲁还说，只有乡村变得强大和繁荣，印度才能进步。他认为，应该给乡评议会以更多的权力。
    尼赫鲁说，拥有的土地很少的农民不可能希望生产得更多。假如他们自愿联合起来进行合作耕种，他们就会好得多。他强调说，合作耕种的建议从来也不是为了取消他们对土地的所有权。也不会强迫人民来进行合作耕种。
