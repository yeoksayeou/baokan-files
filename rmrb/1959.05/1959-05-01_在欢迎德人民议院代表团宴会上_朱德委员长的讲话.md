Esteemed Chairman Dieckmann, Vice-Chairman Matern, esteemed comrades of the delegation:

Today, we are very pleased to receive the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to you and pay our highest respect to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

The German Democratic Republic is a peace-loving country that truly represents the interests of the German nation and the glorious future of all German people. Over the past decade, under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic, the people of the German Democratic Republic have made tremendous achievements in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and science and technology, and in creating their own peaceful and happy life. They are now confidently and victoriously implementing the 1959 national economic development plan and striving to accelerate the completion of socialist construction tasks. We wish them continued new and great achievements.

The German Democratic Republic has always been committed to strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the cause of world peace. The German Socialist Unity Party has waged a resolute struggle against modern revisionism to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic have made outstanding contributions to achieving European collective security, easing international tensions, and developing friendly and cooperative relations with the people of all countries.

In order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the People's Chamber and government of the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly put forward proposals conducive to the conclusion of a German peace treaty, promoting rapprochement between the two Germanys, and establishing a confederation, and have actively supported the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful solution to the German question. Not long ago, the Soviet government, in its consistent position of upholding peace, once again proposed ending the occupation status of West Berlin, convening a peace conference, concluding a German peace treaty, and holding a summit meeting between the East and the West. The Chinese people warmly support and fully support these reasonable proposals of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. However, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and the reactionary ruling clique of West Germany are doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the peaceful settlement of the German question. We can be sure that the imperialist policy of dividing Germany and maintaining the occupation status of West Berlin will eventually suffer a shameful defeat. Final victory will surely belong to the great German people.

In recent years, the German Democratic Republic has supplied us with many industrial equipments and has sent many experts to help our country in its construction. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese people.

Comrades, friends, I propose a toast:

	To the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people,
	To the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,
	To world peace,
	To the health of Chairman Dieckmann, Vice-Chairman Matern, and all the comrades of the delegation,
	To the health of President Wilhelm Pieck, the beloved friend of the Chinese people and the respected leader of the German people!

    在欢迎德人民议院代表团宴会上
    朱德委员长的讲话亲爱的狄克曼主席，马特恩副主席，亲爱的代表团全体同志们：
    今天，我们非常愉快地接待德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团。我谨代表全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎，并向德意志民主共和国政府和人民致以崇高的敬意。
    德意志民主共和国是真正代表德意志民族利益和全德国人民的光荣前途的爱好和平的国家。十年来，德意志民主共和国人民，在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，在政治、经济、文化和科学技术各方面，在创造着自己的和平幸福生活方面，都取得了巨大的成就。现在正在满怀信心地胜利地执行着1959年发展国民经济计划，为加速完成社会主义建设的任务而奋斗。我们祝他们继续获得新的巨大成就。
    德意志民主共和国一向致力于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结和维护世界和平的事业。德国统一社会党为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，同现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。德意志民主共和国政府和人民，在争取实现欧洲集体安全、缓和国际紧张局势、发展同各国人民的友好合作关系方面，作出了卓越的贡献。
    为了争取实现祖国的和平统一，德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府一再提出有利于缔结对德和约、促进两个德国接近和建立邦联的建议，积极支持苏联关于和平解决德国问题的主张。不久前，苏联政府本着一贯维护和平的立场，再次提出结束西柏林占领状态、召开和会、缔结对德和约、举行东西方最高级会议等建议。中国人民热烈拥护并且全力支持德意志民主共和国和苏联这些合情合理的建议。但是以美国为首的帝国主义集团和西德反动统治集团却千方百计地阻挠和破坏德国问题的和平解决。我们可以肯定，帝国主义分裂德国和保持西柏林占领状态的政策最后必然会遭受可耻的失败。最后胜利一定属于伟大的德意志人民。
    几年来，德意志民主共和国供应了我们许多工业装备，并且派遣了许多专家帮助我国进行建设。我愿意借此机会代表中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    同志们、朋友们，我提议：
    为中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为狄克曼主席、马特恩副主席和代表团全体同志的健康，
    为中国人民敬爱的朋友、德意志人民敬爱的领袖威廉·皮克总统的健康，干杯！
