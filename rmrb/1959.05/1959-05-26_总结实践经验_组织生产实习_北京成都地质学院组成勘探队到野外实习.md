    Summarize Practical Experience and Organize Production Internships
    Beijing and Chengdu Geological Colleges Form Exploration Teams for Field Internships
    (Our reporter, Yu Huiyin, reports) Teachers and students of Beijing Geological College wrote a large number of papers and reports during last year's field production. The school is preparing to sort out the more mature parts, improve them, and start compiling teaching materials on this basis. For projects that are not mature enough but have important significance, they have been included in the college's scientific and technological research plan, and manpower will be organized to carry out in-depth special research in conjunction with this year's fieldwork. From May 10th, most of the teachers and all the students of the first, second, third, and fourth grades of this college have left the school one after another to start this year's production internship. The more than 4,000 teachers and students participating in this production internship have formed twelve geological survey teams and several "insertion teams" (working in the exploration teams of various provinces) or special scientific research teams. The survey teams will go to twelve provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Beijing, to carry out regional measurement work. Each insertion team will also undertake certain production tasks in conjunction with their major, and collect relevant data for scientific research. Each team will also actively conduct on-site theoretical teaching in combination with the practical problems encountered in production labor.
    In the process of implementing the Party's education policy, Beijing Geological College has determined that running "geological teams" is a major way for all teachers and students to combine teaching and participate in production labor. From June to December last year, 6,000 teachers and students participated in field geological work. They traveled across 25 provinces and cities, and learned a lot of valuable direct knowledge in the colorful classroom of nature. In half a year, teachers and students discovered many iron, coal, and copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, and rare metal resources in various places, completed the task of filling geological maps in an area of more than 400,000 square kilometers. At the same time, they carried out mass scientific research in combination with these field works, and wrote more than 10,600 scientific papers and materials.
    At the beginning of this year, after the teachers and students of the Geological College returned to school with a comprehensive harvest of political ideology, teaching, production, and scientific research, the college party committee took a series of measures to organize them to sort out and improve these papers. There were two main methods: one was to first select the best papers through the layers of recommendation by each team, medium team, and large team, and the review of teachers in each relevant teaching and research group; the other was under the unified leadership of the school's Science and Technology Committee, with teachers in each relevant teaching and research section as the main body, and twelve professional groups such as mineral products, coalfield geology, and prospecting and exploration were established to classify and concentrate the papers according to discipline and problem, and process and sort them out into more complete and material-rich papers. Using these methods, the first batch of sorted out papers has reached 126. Among them are new discussions on geological theoretical laws; summaries, predictions, and planning of regional geological structures, minerals, and water conservancy resources; research on mineral deposit industrial types, especially their genetic laws; research on field geological work methods and new prospecting methods, and improvement and trial production of new precision drilling tools, etc. Lu Xiang, a lecturer in the Exploration and Prospecting Teaching and Research Section of the Exploration Department, compiled the paper "Important Experience of the Laboring People in Prospecting." Some parts have been arranged into courses such as "Prospecting and Exploration Methods" and become new components of the teaching content of these courses. Professor Zhang Bingxi, director of the Exploration Department, and others, based on a large number of papers and investigation reports, comprehensively wrote the article "Some New Understandings of Chinese Iron Deposits," which put forward new insights in academics and production on the genesis, distribution laws, prospecting, direction, and evaluation of the main types of iron ore in our country. This part of the material has been arranged into the "Mineral Deposits and Industrial Types" course. In the "Structural Geology" course of the Survey Department, for the structure of metamorphic rocks, which are widely distributed in our country, in the past, due to the lack of material, it could only be generally explained for one and a half hours at most. After enriching the materials obtained in the fieldwork, this chapter can be talked about for four hours, and the content is vivid and easy for students to understand.
    (Our reporter, Zhou Zuyou, reports) Chengdu Geological College, according to the characteristics of geological majors, establishes production labor bases mainly by organizing field teams, and makes in-depth and detailed arrangements for teaching, production labor, and scientific research work.
    Since last year, Chengdu Geological College has successively sent more than 1,000 teachers and students to 240 counties in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces to participate in field geological work. In more than half a year, they trekked through mountains and ridges, searching for more than 7,000 new mineral points for the country, and discovered 38 kinds of various mineral deposits such as ferrous, non-ferrous, rare metals and radioactive elements. At the same time, they also trained more than 27,000 prospectors for the local areas and assisted the local areas in organizing 254 geological teams. In practice, they have gained extremely rich practical knowledge of field work, and learned a series of technical operation methods from topographic and geological surveying to compiling geological summary reports. Most students have the ability to work independently. In addition, the majority of teachers and students also conducted more than 200 scientific research projects according to production needs, which effectively promoted production.
    After carefully summarizing last year's experience, this college has made specific plans for this year according to teaching needs. First, the college will form its own field team to contract geological work tasks in a certain area; second, cooperate with the exploration team of the production unit, accept its leadership, and undertake a part of the tasks; third, teachers and students will be inserted into relevant organizations of the production team separately. Under the premise of considering teaching needs, this year they will focus on self-organized teams, and appropriately organize a small number of teachers and students to participate in cooperative teams and insertion teams, so that they can learn knowledge more systematically and comprehensively. In addition, it also appropriately adopts the method of mixing students of different majors or different grades to form teams, which can better undertake comprehensive production tasks, and also facilitates senior students to help junior students.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of scientific research combined with teaching and production labor, a batch of research topics was formulated in advance, and various preparations such as data collection were done on campus. At present, the more important research topics determined by each major include more than a dozen items such as the distribution law of sedimentary iron ore in the Sichuan Basin, the research on Emeishan basalt, and the research on alkaline rocks and rare element problems, some of which have been included in the Sichuan Provincial Scientific Research Work Plan.
    The field exploration teams organized by teachers and students of the Geological College are going to the field bases in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi and other provinces and autonomous regions in batches.

    总结实践经验  组织生产实习
    北京成都地质学院组成勘探队到野外实习
    本报讯  记者余辉音报道：北京地质学院师生在去年野外生产中写出了大批论文和报告，学校正准备把其中比较成熟的部分整理出来，加以提高，并在此基础上着手编写教材。对于内容不够成熟，但有重要意义的一些项目，已列入全院科学技术研究规划，结合今年的野外工作，组织人力深入进行专题的研究。从5月10日起，这个学院大部分教师和一、二、三、四年级全体学生已陆续离校，开始进行今年度的生产实习。参加这次生产实习的四千多名师生，组成了十二个地质普查大队和若干“插入队”（插到各省勘探队中工作）或专题科学研究队。普查大队将到山西、湖南、广东、贵州、北京等十二个省市，进行区域测量工作。各插入队也将结合专业承担一定的生产任务，并搜集有关资料进行科学研究。各个队还要结合生产劳动中遇到的实际问题，积极进行现场理论教学。
    北京地质学院在执行党的教育方针的过程中，确定以办“地质队”作为全院师生结合教学参加生产劳动的一种主要方式。去年6月至12月，有六千师生先后参加了野外地质工作。他们踏遍二十五省、市，在丰富多彩的大自然课堂里学到许多宝贵的直接知识。半年内，师生们在各地发现了很多铁矿、煤矿和铜、铝、铅、锌、稀有金属资源，完成了四十多万平方公里地区的填地质图任务，同时，结合这些野外工作开展了群众性的科学研究，写出了各种科学论文和资料一万零六百多篇。
    今年年初，地质学院师生带着政治思想、教学、生产、科学研究的全面丰收回校后，学院党委就采取了一系列的措施组织他们对这些论文进行整理和提高。主要办法有二，一个是经各小队、中队、大队层层推荐和各有关教研组教师们的审阅，首先把最好的论文推选出来；一个是在全校科学技术委员会统一领导下，以各有关教研室教师为主，另成立矿产、煤田地质、找矿勘探等十二个专业组，将论文按学科、按问题分类集中，加工整理，成为内容比较完整、材料比较充实的论文。采取这些办法，第一批整理出来的论文已有一百二十六篇。其中有对地质理论规律的新探讨；对一个区域地质构造、矿产、水利资源的总结、预测和规划；对矿床工业类地型，特别是它们的成因规律的研究；对野外地质工作方法和新的找矿方法的研究，对新的精密钻探工具的改进和试制等等。勘探系勘探找矿教研室讲师卢祥整理的论文“劳动人民找矿重要经验”，一些部分已分别安排到“找矿勘探方法”等课程中，成为这些课程教学内容中新的组成部分。勘探系系主任张炳熹教授等根据大量的论文和调查报告，综合写成的“对于中国铁矿床的一些新认识”一文，对我国主要类型的铁矿的成因、分布规律、找矿、方向和评价等方面，在学术上、生产上提出了新的见解。这部分材料已安排到“矿床及工业类型”课中。普查系的“构造地质学”课中，对于在我国分布很广的变质岩石的构造，过去由于掌握材料较少，最多只能笼统地讲一个半小时。充实了野外工作中获得的材料后，这一章讲四小时还讲不完，内容生动，学生容易理解。
    本报讯  记者周祖佑报道：成都地质学院根据地质专业的特点，以组织野外队为主要形式，建立生产劳动基地，对教学、生产劳动和科学研究工作进行深入细致的安排。
    去年以来，成都地质学院先后有一千多名教师、学生到四川、云南、贵州等省的二百四十多个县参加野外地质工作。他们在半年多时间，跋涉丛山峻岭，为国家找寻到七千多个新矿点，发现黑色、有色、稀有金属和放射性元素等各种矿藏三十八种。同时，他们还为地方培养了二万七千多名找矿员，协助地方组织了二百五十四支地质队。在实践中，他们获得了极为丰富的野外工作的实际知识，学会了从地形、地质测量直到编写地质总结报告等一系列技术操作方法，大部分学生具备了独立工作的能力。此外，广大师生还根据生产需要，进行了二百多个项目的科学研究工作，有力地推动了生产。
    在认真细致地总结去年的经验后，这个学院根据教学需要，又作出了今年的具体计划。一、学院自组野外队，承包一定地区的地质工作任务；二、与生产单位的勘探队协作，接受其领导，分工承担一部分任务；三、将师生分别插入生产队有关组织中。在考虑教学需要的前提下，今年他们以自组队为主，并适当组织少数师生参加协作队和插入队，使学得知识更加系统和全面。此外，还适当地采用了把不同专业或不同年级学生混合编队，这样能够更好地承担综合性的生产任务，也便于高年级学生帮助低年级学生。
    为了保证科学研究结合教学和生产劳动顺利进行，事先拟订出一批研究题目，在校内就作好资料搜集等各种准备工作。现在，各专业确定的较重要的研究题目，已有关于四川盆地沉积铁矿的分布规律，峨嵋山玄武岩的研究、碱性岩石与稀有元素问题研究等十几项，其中一部分并已列入四川省科学研究工作计划内。
    地质学院师生组织的野外勘探队，是分批到四川、云南、贵州、广西等省、自治区野外基地去的。
