    Do a Good Job in Seed Selection and Retention of Summer Harvest Crops
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The winter wheat in the Yangtze River basin is about to ripen, and the winter wheat in the Yellow River and Huai River basins is also heading or filling. How to arrange this year's summer harvest crops, especially the seed selection and retention of winter wheat, is an important task in current agricultural production that should be grasped immediately.
    "One good seed yields a thousand grains of good harvest," is an experienced saying. Using fine seeds is an economical and effective measure to increase production; combining summer harvesting with seed selection and retention is precisely to prepare conditions for increasing production of summer crops next year. In the past few years, with the vigorous promotion by the state and the leadership of party committees at all levels, seed selection and breeding work has been greatly developed, and many places have achieved self-sufficiency in fine seeds. However, there are also a few places that regard the work of cultivating and promoting fine seeds as only a matter for the state, and have not conscientiously implemented the policy of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use," and even simply rely on the state's supply of seeds. The state's competent departments, in order to support agricultural production, have supplied many seeds to areas in need of seeds over the years, but the seeds temporarily transferred and supplied by the state are mostly selected from commercial grain depots, with uneven varieties and different regional adaptability. It should be said that this is not the best way. Some people also have this view on seed selection and retention work, believing that the seeds planted this year are all fine seeds, so there is no need to carry out seed selection and retention work anymore. The popularization of fine seeds has created more favorable conditions for seed selection and retention work, but it cannot make us no longer pay attention to seed selection and retention work. Because, crops growing in the field will continue to mutate due to the influence of surrounding conditions and natural hybridization. The seeds of crops are most likely to be mixed during the process of harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing. Therefore, no matter what kind of fine seeds, if they are allowed to develop naturally in continuous cultivation, their purity will be reduced, and their excellent characteristics will be weakened or even disappear. Only through repeated selection and constant elimination can we achieve perfection. Therefore, in areas where fine seeds have been popularized, we should still select seeds with higher yields, better quality, and stronger resistance to diseases and insect pests for use as seeds.
    What issues should be paid attention to in doing a good job in this year's summer harvest crop seed selection and retention work?
    Summer harvest and summer planting is the most intense season for agricultural activities. If you want to do a solid job in seed selection and retention, you must prepare in advance. For example, what methods should be used to select and retain seeds, there should be a plan in advance. Communes with conditions can select and retain seeds by the whole ear, or after field inspection in the seed field, carry out necessary weeding and inferior removal work, and harvest all of them for seed. The labor force required for selecting and retaining fine seeds should also be properly arranged. This year, most people's communes have set up fine seed breeding farms or seed fields, and have professional teams to take charge of breeding work. They have considerable experience. This is an extremely favorable condition for launching seed selection and retention work this year. Taking these professional farms and teams as the core, strengthening leadership, and at the same time providing some necessary labor assistance as much as possible, they can complete this year's seed selection and retention tasks. In communes that do not yet have these professional organizations, if experienced old farmers are organized to impart technology in a planned way, and lead some semi-laborers to participate, this work can also be done well. In terms of equipment, there are also many things that can be done in advance, don't grab them temporarily.
    Seed selection and retention is to supply this year's autumn planting, and to prepare conditions for a bumper harvest next summer from the seed aspect. Therefore, the seeds selected and retained should be excellent varieties suitable for local cultivation conditions. We must select seeds with pure varieties, uniform and strong crop growth, and full grains for seed retention, and harvest and thresh them separately, dry and winnow them clean. Pay attention to preventing mixing in all processes, and try to achieve "pure, full, dry, clean, free from disease and insect infection and weeds", because only such seeds are easy to store, and after sowing, they can produce uniform, strong and disease-free seedlings, laying the foundation for future harvests. At the same time, it should also be retained in accordance with this year's autumn crop planting plan area and the amount of sowing required for reasonable close planting, and appropriately retain more reserve seeds for temporary needs to replant or change the planting plan. In the past, many agricultural cooperatives often caused the seeds to be mixed, moldy, and infested with insects due to poor storage after seed selection and retention, and all previous efforts were wasted. This year, when selecting and retaining fine seeds, all communes should set up special fields and special warehouses, and designate special personnel to be responsible for storage.
    In order to adapt to the changes in agricultural production conditions after the Great Leap Forward and communization, this year's summer harvest should also prepare conditions for further improving agricultural production and cultivating better varieties. Therefore, when selecting and retaining fine seeds, we should select as many different varieties as possible in order to adapt to the different requirements of different land conditions, different water conservancy conditions, and tight labor in large-scale production after communization. And we can make comparisons in future production, select and eliminate them. At the same time, in the people's communes, some experienced old farmers who have experience in seed selection can also be recommended to combine seed selection and retention work, and use the variations that occur in the crops themselves to select single ears or single plants with particularly large ears, many grains, strong resistance to diseases and insect pests, strong high-yield performance, and outstanding performance, and collect them separately for future cultivation and comparison, and cultivate new fine seeds from them.
    Wheat is the most important crop in the summer harvest, and of course we must first select good wheat varieties for seed selection and retention. Summer harvest crops also include barley, broad beans, peas, and purple cloud clover, golden flower vegetables, and vetch, which also need to pay attention to selecting and retaining fine seeds to meet the needs of agricultural production development and prepare conditions for a comprehensive bumper harvest of various summer crops in the future.

    作好夏收作物选种留种工作
    本报评论员
    长江流域的冬麦即将黄熟，黄河、淮河流域的冬麦也在抽穗或灌浆。如何安排今年的夏熟作物特别是冬麦的选种留种工作，是当前农业生产上应当立即抓紧的一个重要环节。
    “一颗良种，千粒好粮”，这是一句经验谈。选用良种是一项经济有效的增产措施；结合夏收工作选留良种，正是为了给明年夏季作物的增产准备条件。几年来，在国家大力提倡和各级党委的领导下，选种育种工作有了很大的开展，很多地方已经作到了良种自给。但是也有少数地方，把培育和推广良种的工作，看成只是国家的事情，没有认真贯彻“自繁、自选、自留、自用”的方针，甚至单纯地依赖国家供应种子。国家的主管部门为了支援农业生产，历年都对需要种子的地区供应了不少种子，但是国家临时调运、供应的种子，多数是由商品粮库里选出来的，其中品种不齐，地区适应性各异，应该说，这并不是一个最好的办法。也有人对选种留种工作存在着这样一种看法，认为今年种的都是良种了，因此不必再进行选种留种工作。良种已经普及，给选种留种工作造成了更有利的条件，却不能使我们从此不再重视选种留种工作。因为，生长在田里的作物，由于周围条件和自然杂交的影响，会不断发生变异。作物的籽实在收、打、晒、藏过程中，又最容易发生混杂。因此不论任何良种，如果在连年栽培中听其自流，纯度都会降低，优良特性都会减弱甚至消失。只有反复选择、不断淘汰，才能精益求精。因此，在已普及良种的地区仍然应当选择产量更高、质量更好、抗病虫害力强的种子作种。
    作好今年的夏收作物选种留种工作，应该注意解决一些什么问题呢？
    夏收夏种是农事活动最紧张的季节，要想切实做好选种留种工作，事先要做好准备。比如应该采用什么办法选留种子，要在事先有个规划。有条件的公社可以全部穗选留种，也可以在种子田里经过田间检验，进行必要的去杂去劣工作后，全部收获作种。对选留良种所需的劳动力，更要妥善加以安排。今年各人民公社大多已设有良种繁殖场或种子田，并设有专业队担任繁殖工作，他们有相当经验，这是今年展开选种留种工作极为有利的条件。以这些专业场、队为核心，加强领导，同时尽量补助一些必要的劳动力，就可以由他们完成今年的选种留种任务。在还没有这些专业组织的公社，如有计划地组织有经验的老农传授技术，带领一些半劳动力参加，也可以把这项工作搞好。在设备方面，也有许多事情可以事先做好，不要临时现抓。
    选种留种是为了供应今年的秋种，是为了从种子方面给明年夏季大丰收准备条件，因此，选留的种子应该是适于当地栽培条件的优良品种，要选品种纯洁、作物生长整齐健壮、籽粒饱满的留种，并且单收单打，晒干扬净。在一切过程中注意防止混杂，尽量做到“纯、饱、干、净、无病虫感染和杂草”，因为只有这样的种子才便于保管，播种后才能生出整齐健壮和病虫害很少的幼苗，为将来的丰收奠定基础。同时，还应该根据今年秋季作物种植计划面积和合理密植所需的播种量留足，并酌量多留一些后备种子，以备临时需要补种或改变种植计划的情况发生时需用。以往不少农业社在选种留种以后，由于没有保管好，往往使种子混杂霉坏生虫，前功尽弃，今年各公社在选留良种时就应当设专场专仓，指定专人负责保管。
    为了适应大跃进和公社化后在农业生产条件上所发生的变化，在今年夏收中，还应该为进一步提高农业生产和为培育更好的品种准备条件。因此，在选留良种时，要尽可能多选留几种不同的品种，以便适应公社化后大规模生产中土地条件不同，水利条件不同以及劳力紧张等不同情况的不同要求。并可在今后生产中得出比较，加以选择和淘汰。同时，在人民公社里有的还可以推举几个对于选种有经验的老农，结合选种留种工作，利用作物本身发生的变异，选择穗特别大，粒特别多，抗病虫力大、丰产性能强，表现很突出的单穗或单株，单独收藏，将来分别培育比较，从中培育出新的良种来。
    小麦是夏收中最主要的作物，选种留种当然要先把小麦品种选好。夏收作物中还有大麦、蚕豆、豌豆和紫云英、金花菜、苕子等，也需注意选留良种，以满足农业生产发展的需要，为今后夏季各种作物全面大丰收准备条件。
