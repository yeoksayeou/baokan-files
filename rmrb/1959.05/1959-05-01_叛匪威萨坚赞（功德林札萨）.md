    Rebel Weisa Jiantan (Gongdelin Zhaza)
    Weisa Jiantan was born a lama and is a loyal lackey cultivated by imperialism in Tibet. He is also a staunch defender of the Tibetan serf system. After the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in 1956, he firmly opposed any reforms in Tibet. In the winter of 1956, he accompanied the Dalai Lama to India, where he colluded with traitors such as Xia Geba, advocating "Tibetan independence." After returning to China in 1957, he organized the reactionary "Officials' Representative Conference" with reactionary elements such as Pala and Langselin. In this armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan local government, he served as the commander-in-chief of the rebel army in Lhasa.
