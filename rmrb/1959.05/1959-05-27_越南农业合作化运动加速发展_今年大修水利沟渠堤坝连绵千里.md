Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 26th – The agricultural cooperativization movement in North Vietnam has developed even more rapidly in the past two months. In the villages of the plains provinces, on the basis of vigorously consolidating and developing year-round mutual aid teams, a large number of elementary agricultural production cooperatives have been newly established. Some other elementary cooperatives are preparing to transition to advanced cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, as of now, there are more than 10,360 agricultural production cooperatives in North Vietnam, including 300,000 farm households, accounting for 11.4% of the farm households in North Vietnam.

More than 5,600 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the past two months. For example, Xing'an Province had 231 cooperatives at the end of March, and now it has developed to 860. Taiping Province has grown from 221 to the current 1,310. In particular, Yongning District, which is close to the 17th parallel, has now basically achieved district-wide cooperativization, with cooperative members accounting for more than 80% of the total number of households in the district.

Currently, the provinces in the North Vietnamese plains are combining the summer harvest with the large-scale establishment of new cooperatives and the consolidation and expansion of existing cooperatives. In many villages in Xing'an, Beining, and Taiping provinces, farmers have recently been celebrating the unprecedented bumper harvest of early summer rice and the establishment of hundreds of new cooperatives with gongs and drums.

The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives established before this year have fully demonstrated the superiority of collective farming in the production of last autumn and this summer, causing more and more individual farmers to request to join the old agricultural production cooperatives. The agricultural cooperatives established in Shanxi Province last year have absorbed 1,280 households in the past month or so; in Xing'an Province, more than 2,900 farm households are applying to join 92 agricultural cooperatives.

The strengthening of the leadership of the local labor party organizations over the cooperativization movement and the strengthening of socialist education for farmers are the main reasons for the rapid development of the cooperativization movement. Since the second quarter, many provincial and county party secretaries have personally taken charge and gone deep into the leadership of the cooperativization movement. The number of training classes for cooperativization cadres newly established in various provinces and counties is also increasing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 26th - Since the beginning of this year, the "digging ditches, building dikes, and engaging in water conservancy" campaign in North Vietnam has achieved great results. Provinces have dug various small irrigation ditches stretching for thousands of miles; provinces along the Red River have built hundreds of kilometers of "flood control Great Walls."

According to preliminary statistics from the Vietnamese Ministry of Water Conservancy, North Vietnam has already built more than 12.3 million cubic meters of earthwork for dikes, which is three times more than the total earthwork built for dikes in the whole of last year.

Yongfu, Beijiang, Hedong, Jian'an provinces, and Hongguang and Haiphong have completed and exceeded their annual dike construction plans by the end of April and early May. Of the 93 stone revetment projects included in this year's plan throughout North Vietnam, 57 have been completed and 18 have started construction; of the 92 sluice gates planned to be built this year, 42 have been completed.

Thousands of villages have formulated village-level water conservancy plans. According to specific conditions, the plans of the plains villages focus on digging ditches, while the mountain villages focus on both digging ditches and drilling wells. And the overall water conservancy policy of Vietnam is: "Water storage is the main priority, small-scale projects are the main focus, and people-run projects are the main method."

In Xing'an Province, where the achievements in water conservancy work are the most remarkable, the province launched a mass movement of "vigorously engaging in water conservancy" in the past four months, digging and filling a total of 4.8 million cubic meters of earth for various water conservancy irrigation systems. This number is equal to the sum of the earthwork dug by various water conservancy irrigation systems in the province in the past four years.

The great development of water conservancy work in Xing'an Province has brought great benefits to agricultural production. Xing'an Province used to suffer from droughts affecting more than 5,000 hectares every year, but this year the area of dry land has been greatly reduced. At the same time, the farmers of this province have expanded the irrigated area, so that the planting area of early rice this summer has increased by 10,000 hectares compared with last year, and thus recently won the Red Flag award from the Vietnamese government.

    越南农业合作化运动加速发展
    今年大修水利沟渠堤坝连绵千里
    本报河内26日电  越南北方农业合作化运动两个月来发展得更加迅速。平原各省乡村在大力巩固和发展常年变工组的基础上，新建了一大批初级农业生产合作社。另一些初级合作社正准备转为高级社。据不完全的统计，到目前为止，全北越已经有农业生产合作社一万零三百六十多个，包括三十万农户，占北越农户的11.4％。
    两个月来新建了五千六百多个农业生产合作社，如兴安省3月底共有二百三十一个社，现在发展到八百六十个，太平省从二百二十一个发展到目前的一千三百一十个。特别是靠近十七度纬线的永宁区，目前已经基本上实现全区合作化，入社农户占全区农户总数的80％以上。
    目前北越平原各省正在结合着夏收大批成立新的合作社、巩固和扩大原有的合作社。在兴安、北宁、太平各省许多乡村的农民近日来敲锣打鼓，庆祝夏季早稻的空前丰收和庆祝成百个新的合作社的成立。
    绝大部分今年以前成立的农业合作社由于在去秋和今夏的生产中充分显示了集体耕作的优越性，使得越来越多的单干农民要求加入老的农业生产合作社。山西省各个去年成立的农业社在最近一个多月中已经吸收了一千二百八十户入社；在兴安省有二千九百多农户正在分别申请加入九十二个农业社。
    各地劳动党组织加强了对合作化运动的领导和加强对农民的社会主义教育是促使合作化运动迅速发展的主要原因。第二季度以来，许多省、县委书记都先后亲自挂帅，深入领导合作化运动。各省、县新办的合作化干部训练班也越来越多。
    新华社河内26日电  今年以来，越南北方各地的“挖渠、筑堤、搞水利”的运动取得了巨大成绩。各省都已经挖了连绵千里的各种小灌溉沟；红河沿岸各省已经筑起成百公里的“防洪长城”。
    据越南水利部的初步统计，目前，全北越已经筑堤达一千二百三十多万土方，比去年全年筑堤的土方数多三倍。
    永福、北江、河东、建安等省和鸿广、海防已经在4月底和5月初完成和超额完成全年的筑堤计划。在全北越各地列入今年计划的九十三个石头护堤工程中，有五十七个已经完工，十八个已经开工修建；计划在今年修建的九十二个水闸中，有四十二个已经完工。
    成千个乡已经制订了乡的水利规划。根据具体条件，平原各乡的规划着重于挖沟，山区各乡挖沟和掘井并重。而越南总的水利工作方针是：“蓄水为主、小型为主、民办为主”。
    在水利工作成绩最显著的兴安省，四个月来全省发动了“大搞水利”的群众运动，共为各种水利灌溉系统挖土和填土四百八十万土方。这个数目等于这个省过去四年内各种水利灌溉系统挖土量的总和。
    兴安省水利工作的大发展给农业生产带来了巨大的利益。兴安省过去每年受旱面积达五千公顷以上，今年则旱田大大减少。同时，这个省的农民扩大了灌溉面积，使今夏的早稻种植面积比去年增加了一万公顷，因而在最近获得越南政府奖给的红旗。
