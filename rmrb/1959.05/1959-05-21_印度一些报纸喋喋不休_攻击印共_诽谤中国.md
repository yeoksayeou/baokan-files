Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, New Delhi Dispatch: Some Indian newspapers are attacking the Indian Communist Party. They are annoyed by the just stance taken by the Indian Communist Party in its resolution on the Tibet issue.

　　The Urdu "Glory Daily" in today's editorial used all the vocabulary of anti-communist propaganda, calling the Indian Communist Party's resolution on the Tibet issue a "tedious copy of the Chinese government spokesman's statement," a "living proof of its allegiance to a foreign country."

　　"Free Press" in its May 16th editorial adopted the same trick, saying that the Indian Communist Party "has become Beijing's mouthpiece in this country."

　　The "Hindu" published an editorial on May 15th saying, "We cannot treat the Tibetan incident as China's internal affair as required by the Indian Communist Party's resolution."

　　This Indian newspaper emphasized the necessity of the kind of "Tibetan autonomy" it was hoping for, even though Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs. It said, "India's main concern at present is to resolve the Tibetan issue peacefully and amicably." It said in a threatening tone, "If they (referring to China) fail to do so, they not only risk losing India's friendship, but will also gradually lose the sympathy of all non-committed Asian countries."

　　The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on May 15th, posing as a representative of the Indian people, saying that the Indian Communist Party's resolution "completely ignores the feelings and anxieties of the Indian people." It also accused the Indian Communist Party of using the "convenient 'Tibet region of the People's Republic of China' fabricated by China" in the resolution to replace the name "historically significant Tibet," saying, "Geographically and culturally, Tibet is as old as China," and imposing a new name on it will make people "worry about the future of the guaranteed autonomy."

　　The "Assam Tribune" published an editorial on May 16th, attacking the Indian Communist Party for "not saying a word in the resolution to express sympathy for the Tibetan people, whose autonomy is being militarily suppressed by the suzerain state of China." The "Indian Nation" published an editorial on May 16th, attempting to take the opportunity to stir up an anti-communist movement. It called on India to be vigilant against communists and China, because "Sino-Indian friendship has been overemphasized." It said, "In India, the task is more urgent because it is geographically close to communism and because there is a communist party within the country."

　　The Urdu "Glory Daily" clamored in its May 17th editorial in an alarmist manner that "the communist occupation of Tibet puts our country in danger of a communist revolution." It criticized the Indian government for not asking the Tibetans to "resist China" and for not raising the issue in the United Nations in 1950. It called on the Indian government to take a tough stance against China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th: The "Indian Nation," which has consistently undermined Sino-Indian friendship, published another short commentary on the 18th, slandering the Indian Communist Party and provoking relations between China and India.

　　This newspaper, published in Patna, the capital of Bihar, by feudal landlords, said in a short commentary: "India is in a delicate situation, a formerly friendly great power is now carrying out all kinds of threats. There is a political party, namely the Indian Communist Party, which is defending China and showing no respect for Indian feelings. The Indian people are shocked by China's imposition of its way of life on Tibet. They have probably begun to feel that if the Communists in India could do as they please, their actions would be the same."

　　This newspaper even said that "Sino-Indian relations themselves are not the goal." It said, "If India has to give up its own opinions and freedom of thought in front of China in order to maintain friendship, then this opinion must be carefully considered." This newspaper had previously provoked by saying that India's respect and friendship for China was "due to the vast majority of Indian people's misunderstanding of the essence of communism."

　　The Urdu Indian "Daily Telegraph" also published a short commentary on the 19th distorting China's religious policy, saying that in China, Islam and Christianity "have been eliminated," and it also spread rumors that in China "temples have been controlled by the state."

### 印度一些报纸喋喋不休  攻击印共　诽谤中国

    印度一些报纸喋喋不休
    攻击印共　诽谤中国
    新华社18日讯　新德里消息：印度一些报纸攻击印度共产党。它们对于印度共产党在关于西藏问题的决议中采取的正当立场感到恼怒。
    乌尔都文“光荣报”在今天的社论中使用了一切反共宣传的词汇，把印度共产党关于西藏问题的决议说成是“中国政府发言人的声明的乏味的抄本”，是“它效忠外国的一个活生生的证据”。
      “自由新闻”在16日社论中采取同样的伎俩，说印度共产党“已成为北京在这个国家的喉舌”。
    “印度教徒报”5月15日发表社论说，“我们不能把西藏事件像印度共产党的决议所要求的那样当作中国的内部事务来看待。”
    这家印度报纸强调它所指望的那种“西藏自治”的必要性，尽管西藏事务是中国的内政。它说，“印度目前主要关心的是，和平而友好地解决西藏问题。”它用要挟的口气说，“如果他们（指中国）做不到这一点，他们不只要冒失去印度友谊的危险，而且还会逐渐失去所有不承担义务的亚洲国家的同情”。
    “甘露市场报”5月15日发表社论，俨然以印度人民代表身份自居，说什么印度共产党的决议“完全忽视了印度人民的感情和不安心情。”它还指责印度共产党在决议中用“中国捏造的方便的‘中华人民共和国西藏地方’”来代替“具有历史意义的西藏”这个名字，它说，“在地理上和文化上，西藏是和中国一样古老的”，强加于它一个新名字会使人们“对于所保证的自治的前途感到担心”。
  “阿萨姆论坛报”16日发表社论，攻击印度共产党在“决议中没有说一句表示出同情西藏人民的话，而他们的自治正在受到宗主国中国的军事镇压”。“印度民族日报”16日发表社论，企图趁机煽起反共运动。它要求印度对共产党人和中国保持警惕，因为“印中友谊受到过分的强调”。它说，“在印度，任务更为迫切，因为它在地理上靠近共产主义，而且因为这个国家内有一个共产党。”
    乌尔都文“荣耀报”在17日的社论中耸人听闻地叫嚷说“共产党占领西藏，使我国面临共产党革命的危险”。它批评印度政府没有要求西藏人“抵抗中国”，1950年没有在联合国提出这个问题。它要求印度政府对中国采取强硬的态度。
    新华社新德里19日电　一贯破坏印中友谊的“印度民族日报”在18日又发表短评，诬蔑印度共产党并挑拨中印关系。
    这家在比哈尔邦首府巴特拿出版的封建土王的报纸在短评中说：“印度处于微妙的情况中，一个过去是友好的大国现在正在进行着各种各样的威胁。有一个政党即印度共产党，它正在为中国辩护，而对印度的感情一点也不尊重。印度人民对于中国把自己的生活方式强加在西藏身上的这种做法感到震惊。他们大概已经开始觉得：如果共产党人在印度可以为所欲为的话，他们的作为将是同样的。”
    这家报纸竟然说，“印中关系本身并不是目的”。它说，“如果为了保持友谊，印度不得不在中国面前放弃自己的意见和自由的思想，那么，对这个意见就不得不仔细地加以考虑。”这家报纸过去就曾经挑拨说，印度对中国的尊重和友谊是“由于绝大多数印度人民对共产主义的本质了解错误的结果”。
    乌尔都文印度“文汇报”19日也发表短评歪曲中国的宗教政策，它说在中国，伊斯兰教和基督教“被消灭了”，它还造谣说，在中国“寺院已经由国家控制”。
