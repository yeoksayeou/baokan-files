According to a report in the Shanxi Daily, the Hao Fu production team of the fourth workshop of the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory has improved its management, resulting in an orderly production process and a rapid increase in product quality and output.

The Hao Fu team consists of ninety-six workers, including forty-six new apprentices who joined the factory after September of last year. The team encompasses five types of work: lathe, fitter, milling, drilling, and stamping. The production tasks they undertake are three to four times greater than last year, involving more than 1,600 product codes and over 6,000 processes. The proportion of trial production tasks is significant. Among the products, the largest diameter is two meters, while the smallest is only five to six millimeters. The production situation is very complex.

In early January, when the team was first established, the production order was somewhat chaotic due to Hao Fu's lack of leadership experience. With the specific assistance of the Party branch, the team's management work was gradually improved.

First, the management structure was improved. In the past, the team's workers participated in management through the "Eight Great Officers" (planning statistician, dispatcher, process engineer, quota setter, tool and material officer, safety officer, attendance accountant, quality inspector), working separately, which was inefficient. Team leader Hao Fu, based on everyone's opinions, decided to change the Eight Great Officers into two offices managed by workers: one is the Planning and Dispatching Office, responsible for managing planning, statistics, dispatching, attendance, accounting, and other tasks; the other is the Technical Preparation Office, responsible for managing processes, quotas, quality inspection of general products, mechanical maintenance, technological innovation, and other tasks. Each office has a worker in overall charge, with four to five management personnel under them. They utilize their spare time to assist each other in their work, which not only makes it easier for the team leader to manage but also overcomes the shortcomings of the past where one person was in charge of one task, resulting in very low work efficiency. At the same time, because the two offices are directly linked to the workshop's technical office and planning office, they are more effective in implementing the workshop's instructions. The workers in the Planning and Dispatching Office can calculate the production results of each worker for the previous day and publicize them to the entire team through forms such as "Labor Competition Platform, Technological Innovation Statistics Table," "Apprentice Evaluation Platform," and "Quota Completion Statistics Table." The Technical Preparation Office can prepare drawings, data, materials, time quotas, and process equipment for each product in advance (sometimes suggesting opinions on reforming processes). After doing this, the workers have clear ideas and are confident, and everyone can understand their production results for the previous day, how large the task is for the day, how many work hours are required, and how much efficiency can be increased by reforming certain tools. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm is even higher. Everyone reflects that these two offices solve problems better than the Eight Great Officers.

Next, the team formulated a series of new team management systems. 1. Machine Tool Responsibility System. The Hao Fu team has ten machine tools, and they assigned a specific person to use each machine tool. Whoever uses it is fully responsible for the machine tool. The machine safety officer gives them a card indicating the machine tool number, performance, and depreciation value, so that each worker understands the "temperament" and value of the machine tool they are using. Therefore, it is easier for them to engage in technological innovation on the machine tool, improve machine tool efficiency, and frequently pay attention to inspection and maintenance.

2. Quality Inspection System. The main products of the Hao Fu team are inspected by the workshop inspectors. The team's inspectors fill out rejection notices every day based on the results of the workshop inspection, stating how many pieces were rejected and the value of the loss, and then send it to the producer himself, so that he can understand how much loss he has caused to the country due to negligence or simply rushing for work hours. It also educates others. Previously, the team's rejection rate reached about one hundred pieces per day at most. After establishing this system, rejection has been basically eliminated.

3. Cost Accounting System. The Hao Fu team decided to hold an economic activity analysis meeting on the 2nd of each month. In April, the cost per man-hour was 32 cents, which was the lowest cost team in the entire workshop. Since establishing this system, workers have been trying every means to reduce costs.

While strengthening production management, Hao Fu also paid special attention to the management of people. This year, the team's characteristic is that there are many new apprentices. Hao Fu often heard the leaders say: Quickly training apprentices is a key to improving labor productivity this year. Therefore, he and the leaders of the team's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League studied and found a way to quickly train apprentices. They sent people to the Jinxi Machine Factory to learn apprentice training experience and then adopted measures such as assigning masters, assigning machine tools, signing contracts, and one master with multiple apprentices. In terms of training methods, they adopted a method combining lectures and practice. Many veteran workers wholeheartedly impart their skills. First, the master does it, and the apprentice watches; then the apprentice does it, and the master guides. The master and apprentice respect and love each other. Therefore, among the forty-six apprentices, twenty-five can already operate independently, and the remaining apprentices can also operate under the guidance of the master. Twenty-five apprentices have also carried out technological innovations, the highest of which has increased efficiency by one hundred times.

A saying is circulating in the Hao Fu team: "If everyone is of one mind, yellow soil can be turned into gold." This is Hao Fu's thought, and it is also the thought of all the workers in the team.

    明确责任　健全制度　生产秩序有条不紊
    郝福小组人人对产品负责
    据山西日报消息　山西机床厂四车间综合生产小组郝福小组改进了管理工作，生产秩序有条不紊，产品质量和产量迅速提高。
    郝福小组共有九十六名工人，其中，去年9月以后入厂的新徒工就有四十六名。小组里包括车、钳、铣、钻、冲压五个工种。担负的生产任务，比去年大三至四倍，产品有一千六百多种代号，六千多道工序。试制任务比重很大。产品当中，最大的直径为二公尺，最小的不过五至六粍。生产情况十分复杂。
    1月初，小组刚刚成立，由于郝福缺乏领导经验，生产秩序一度比较混乱。在党支部具体帮助下，逐步改善了小组管理工作。
    首先，改进管理机构。过去组里工人参加管理，采用的是“八大员”（计划统计员、调度员、工艺员、定额员、工具材料员、安全员、考勤核算员、质量检验员）分头工作，效率不高。小组长郝福根据大家的意见，确定将八大员改成两个由工人参加管理的室：一个是计划调度室，负责管理计划、统计、调度、考勤、核算等工作；另一个是技术准备室，负责管理工艺、定额、一般产品的质量检验、机械维修、技术革新等工作。每室都有一名工人负总责，下有四至五名管理人员。他们利用业余时间，互相协助，进行工作，既便于组长掌握，又克服了过去一个人管一种，工作效率很低的缺点。同时，由于两室与车间的技术室、计划室直接挂钩，在贯彻车间指示时，也更为得力。计划调度室的工人，每天都能计算出前一天每个工人的生产效果，通过“劳动竞赛台，技术革新统计表”，“徒工评比台”，
  “完成定额统计表”等形式，向全组公布；技术准备室，每天都能提前准备好图纸、资料、材料，工时定额以及每种产品的工艺装置（有时是提出改革工艺的意见）。这样作以后，工人们思想明确，心中有底，每天每个人都能了解自己前一天的生产效果，当天的任务有多大，需要多少工时，改革什么工具就能翻多少番。于是工人们的干劲更高了。大家反映：这两个室比八大员解决问题。
    接着，这个小组又制订了一系列新的小组管理制度。一、机床责任制。郝福小组共有十部机床，他们在每部机床上，固定专人使用。谁使用，谁对机床负全责，机安员发给他一张注明机床号码、性能、磨损价值的卡片，使每个工人都了解自己使用这部机床的“脾气”和价值。因此，更便于他们在机床上闹技术革新，提高机床效率，并且经常注意检修、维护。
    二、质量检验制度。郝福小组的主要产品，是车间检验员负责检验，小组的检验员，每天都根据车间检验的结果，填写废品通知单，写明废多少件，损失价值有多大，然后送给生产者本人，使本人了解自己由于疏忽大意，或者单纯抢工时，给国家造成的损失有多大。同时也教育了别人。以前这个小组废品最多时一天曾达到一百件左右，建立这种制度以后，已基本上消灭了废品。
    三、成本核算制度。郝福小组确定每月2日，开经济活动分析会议。4月份每个工时的成本为三角二分钱，是全车间成本最低的小组。自从建立这项制度以后，工人们便千方百计降低成本。
    在加强生产管理的同时，郝福还特别注意了对人的管理工作。今年小组的特点是新徒工多，郝福常听领导上说：迅速培养徒工，是今年提高劳动生产率的一个关键。因此，他和小组党、政、工、团领导人研究找到了快速培养徒工的途径。他们派人到晋西机器厂去学习培养徒工经验，然后，采取定师傅，定机床，定合同，一师多徒等措施。在培养方法上，采取讲课和实践相结合的方法，许多老师傅都全心全意地传授技术。先是师傅干，徒弟看，后是徒弟干，师傅指导，师徒互敬互爱。因此，现在四十六名徒工中，已有二十五名能够单独操作，其余徒工在师傅指导下也都能进行操作。并有二十五名徒工进行了技术革新，最高的提高效率一百倍。
    郝福小组流传着一句话“大家一条心，黄土变成金”。这是郝福的思想，也是全组工人的思想。
