Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 30th: Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company completed its May production plan on the 29th, ahead of schedule. The qualification rate of pig iron reached 90%, an increase of more than 10% compared to April.

At the beginning of May, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's various iron smelting plants, coking plants, sintering plants, mines, and transportation departments earnestly implemented the nine major measures of the Ma'anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company regarding improving the quality and output of pig iron. These included: storing ore and fixing the materials used; increasing the output and quality of sintered ore; improving the quality of coke and reducing the coke ratio; using quicklime instead of limestone as a flux; increasing the wind temperature and appropriately increasing the air volume; improving operating techniques and charging systems, unifying three-shift operations; cadres following shifts to work; trying out the system of fixed output per furnace and bonuses for exceeding quotas; and establishing technical research groups and raw material allocation groups to concentrate efforts on solving the weak links in blast furnace production and transportation.

Before fixing the materials used, the No. 12 blast furnace of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant had a maximum daily output of 300 tons of pig iron. After fixing the materials used, the daily output of pig iron increased to 373 tons, with a qualification rate of 100%. After the No. 8 blast furnace used quicklime as a flux, its daily output increased to 93.9 tons, an average increase of 14.6% compared to the past; the qualification rate averaged over 93%, an increase of 15% compared to the past. After the No. 9 blast furnace increased wind temperature and air volume and reduced the coke ratio, the daily output of pig iron increased by 30% to 40% compared to the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 30th: The workers of the No. 1 electric furnace of Daye Steel Plant, after continuously overfulfilling the steel production task in the first four months of this year, have reported another victory in high quality and high output. In May, they completed the monthly production plan four days and seven hours ahead of schedule; the average daily output increased by 21.16% compared to April, the product qualification rate reached 99.8%, and safe production was achieved.

After entering Red May, the workers of the No. 1 electric furnace of Daye Steel Plant first focused on improving product quality. In April, this furnace only produced one furnace of steel that was scrapped due to non-compliant chemical composition. However, they were not satisfied and were determined to eliminate defective products in May. In response to the high sulfur content in pig iron, the three shifts of workers researched a method of "adding ore during the melting period and desulfurizing by early slagging," which doubled the desulfurization efficiency in the furnace. When encountering excessive sulfur content during tapping, they adopted a "desulfurization by mixing furnace slag and steel" method for secondary desulfurization. The workers managing raw materials improved the method of baking raw materials, reducing the phenomenon of "subcutaneous bubbles" in steel ingots. The ingot casting workers carefully brushed and wiped the steel ingot molds and bottom plates to keep them clean and smooth, eliminating the phenomenon of ash and sand inclusion in the steel ingots. Workers in each process also established a supervision system for implementing operating procedures and a pre-furnace quality inspection system, thereby improving product quality.

    措施多　方法妙
    马钢提前完成五月份计划
    大冶电炉又传优质高产捷报
    新华社合肥30日电　马鞍山钢铁公司29日提前完成5月份生产计划。生铁合格率达到90％，比4月份提高10％以上。
    5月初，马鞍山钢铁公司各炼铁厂、炼焦厂、烧结厂、矿山以及运输等部门，就认真地执行了中共马鞍山市委和马鞍山钢铁公司关于提高生铁质量和产量的九大措施，即：储备矿石，固定用料；提高烧结矿的产量和质量；改进焦炭质量，降低焦比；用生石灰代替石灰石做焙剂；提高风温适当加大风量；改进操作技术和装料制度，统一三班操作；干部跟班劳动；试行定产到炉和超额奖励制度；成立技术研究小组和原料调运小组，集中力量解决高炉生产和交通运输的薄弱环节。
    炼铁一厂十二号高炉在没有固定的用料以前，生铁日产量最高达到三百吨，固定用料之后，生铁日产量提高到三百七十三吨，合格率达到百分之百。八号高炉在全部用生石灰作焙剂后，日产量提高到九十三点九吨，比过去平均增长14.6％；合格率平均达到93％以上，比过去增长15％。九号高炉加大风温、风量、降低焦比后，生铁日产量比过去提高了30％到40％。
    新华社武汉30日电　大冶钢厂一号电炉的工人们继今年头四个月连续超额完成产钢任务之后，又传出优质高产捷报。5月份，他们提前四天零七个小时完成了全月生产计划；平均日产量比4月份提高了21.16％，产品合格率达到99.8％，并且做到安全生产。
    大冶钢厂一号电炉工人在进入红5月之后，首先注意提高产品质量。4月份，这个炉子只出了一炉因化学成分不合而报废的钢，但是，他们并不满足，决心在5月消灭废品。三班工人针对生铁中含硫高的问题，研究出“熔化期加矿石，提前造渣脱硫”的方法，使炉内脱硫效率提高了一倍。在出钢时碰到含硫过高的时候，又采用“同炉渣混合炼钢脱硫”的方法进行二次脱硫。管理原材料的工人改进了烘烤原材料的方法，钢锭发生“皮下气泡”的现象减少。铸锭工人认真刷擦钢锭模和底板，使它们保持清洁和光滑，消灭了钢锭中夹灰夹砂的现象。各工序工人还建立了执行操作规程的监督制度和炉前质量检查制度，从而提高了产品质量。
