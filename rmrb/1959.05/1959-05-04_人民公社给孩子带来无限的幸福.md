Comrades Lu Xiu and Guan Ruiwu's Speeches:

Esteemed members of the committee:

We wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of leading comrades such as Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Peng Zhen, and Li Weihan. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, our country's industrial and agricultural production and other construction endeavors have achieved unprecedented and enormous victories, which fills us with boundless joy and encouragement.

Recently, we conducted inspections in different regions of our motherland – Sichuan and Jiangsu provinces respectively. We witnessed that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and to meet the needs of production development, the work of nurseries and kindergartens has greatly developed. Now, basically every production team within each people's commune has nurseries and kindergartens, greatly liberating the female workforce. For example, in Hutang Commune, Bieqiao Township, Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, women's attendance rate used to be around 40% due to the burden of childcare. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the establishment of nurseries and kindergartens, women's attendance rate has reached 100%. With nurseries and kindergartens, and due to specialized care, children's safety is guaranteed, eliminating drowning and other casualties caused by lack of care, and adults can concentrate on production. We will now briefly report on what we saw during our inspections regarding the educational work in kindergartens:

I. Caring for the healthy growth of children. The kindergarten children we saw were all lively and happy, with rosy, chubby cheeks, and full of energy. This is because they eat better and live better in the kindergartens than at home. When the people's communes slaughter pigs, the Party committees and commune members first think of the children, giving the pork, lard, and pig liver to the kindergartens first. Fresh vegetables from the countryside are given to the children to eat as much as they like. Some kindergartens have children's canteens, and some children in kindergartens eat with adults in the people's commune canteens. The canteen cooks always try their best to make delicious meals for the children. The children's lives in kindergartens are regular. They eat on time, play and have classes on time, and rest on time. This kind of regular life is naturally very beneficial to their health. Furthermore, the people's communes all have medical and health stations, and the doctors and nurses from these stations regularly check the children's health and treat illnesses in the kindergartens. Parents gratefully say, "In the past, when we worked in the fields, our hearts were always at home. The children at home had cold or hot food as it came, and were sometimes hungry and sometimes full, and there was nowhere to go when they were sick. Now that we have kindergartens, we can rest assured about everything. Truly, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are good, the people's communes are good, and we will never forget it in our lives."

II. Paying attention to children's education. The Party committees of the people's communes are extremely concerned about the education of the next generation. First of all, they are very careful in selecting kindergarten teachers. Generally, kindergarten teachers are recommended by the masses and reviewed by the branch. The selection criteria are: politically reliable, loving children, patient with children, having a junior or senior primary school education, being between twenty and thirty years old, healthy, and lively. Because these teachers still lack professional knowledge of early childhood education, the Party committees organize various training classes for them, giving them opportunities to learn. They all study actively and diligently, trying to make the children's lives rich, polite, loving labor, and willing to help others. Secondly, the commune Party committees pay great attention to children's education. Some commune kindergartens have special vegetable gardens, raising cattle, sheep, pigs, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, etc. Every day, teachers lead the children to pull grass and feed these animals, and weed the gardens. The daily labor time is limited to only twenty minutes. These activities greatly interest the children. They not only gain preliminary knowledge about the growth of animals and plants, but also develop a preliminary habit of labor. Some commune Party committees personally compose nursery rhymes for the children. The kindergarten teachers use stories about the deeds of model figures from their hometowns. Because these stories are about things the children encounter in their lives, and they have heard their families talk about them, they are more likely to have an educational effect on them. To enrich the children's lives, the Party committees and teachers actively prepare toys and teaching aids for the children. Some Party committees personally create toys. The Party committees take the lead in mobilizing the masses, primary school teachers, and primary school students to make toys for the kindergarten children. At some people's commune member congresses, the Party committees mobilized all commune members to make a toy for the kindergarten each. The teachers try their best to use waste materials and local products such as bamboo, loofah, wood, shells, etc. to make toys for the children. The masses collect matchboxes, spools, and scraps of leather from their homes and send them to the kindergartens to make toys. The children have things to play with, so they like the kindergartens even more, and they also get educated by playing various games with the toys.

III. Promoting the communist spirit of cooperation, everyone cares about the children. In the people's communes, under the leadership of the Party committees, everyone cares about the children. With the support of the masses, kindergartens can be established with very little money. Because public housing or private housing can be used, the masses help with repairs and cleaning, and kindergarten equipment can be borrowed from the masses. Everyone eats in the canteen, so some kitchen utensils and dining tables can be lent to the kindergartens. Some commune members even take down their doors to make beds for the kindergarten children. In Hekou Township, Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, 49 out of the 52 kindergartens in the township used less than one yuan in their construction. Cadres and the masses actively support this method of running kindergartens in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. After the kindergartens are built, female cadres often care about the needs of the kindergartens. Primary school teachers are even more concerned about guiding the kindergarten teachers in their professional work. In some places, there are public kindergartens, and the teachers in these public kindergartens have higher professional levels. They all actively provide concrete help to the people's commune-run kindergartens. For example, in Anyue County, Sichuan Province, public kindergartens and private kindergartens conduct teaching in the same classes, which drives the teachers of the private kindergartens and fully promotes the spirit of cooperation.

The happiness that people's communes bring to children is something that China has not had for thousands of years, and it is also impossible in capitalist countries today. Because of the people's communes, the productive forces have developed to a high degree, making it possible to develop kindergartens on a large scale and to give children such rich nutrition and healthcare. Because the people's communes can uniformly allocate labor, it is possible to select and assign many qualified early childhood teachers to care for children's education. The people's commune also changed people's mental outlook, everyone promoted the communist spirit of cooperation, and gave children infinite care.

Although we conducted inspections in different work positions and in different regions, we deeply realized that our country's early childhood education, under the care of the Party and under the requirements of social development, has become an indispensable link in the people's welfare undertakings. Under the leadership of the Party, there must be a great deal of valuable experience in early childhood education work all over the country. We hope that relevant departments will collect and organize these experiences so that early childhood educators can learn from each other. We ourselves should also seriously study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies, constantly learn from excellent early childhood educators, transform our thinking, and work together with early childhood educators across the country, under the leadership of the Party, to do a good job in early childhood education.

Now, we would like to express our views on the Tibetan rebellion. The crimes of the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper class, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland are extremely shameful. The so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" recently distributed by Indian diplomatic officials is an extremely absurd and shameless fabrication, is an act of interfering in our country's internal affairs, and is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. Tibet is a part of our country, and suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is the wish of all ethnic groups in the country. We fully believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the help of all ethnic groups in the country, and through the efforts of the Tibetan people, Tibet will surely be built into a paradise on earth. The conspiracy of the Indian interventionists will surely meet with shameful failure.

### 人民公社给孩子带来无限的幸福

    人民公社给孩子带来无限的幸福
    陆秀、关瑞梧委员的发言各位委员：
    我们衷心拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念、彭真、李维汉等首长们的报告。在党的总路线光辉照耀下和毛主席的英明领导下，我国工农业生产和其它各项建设事业，取得了空前巨大的胜利，使我们感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。
    最近我们在祖国的不同地区——四川、江苏两省分别进行了视察，看到在各级党委领导下，为了生产发展的需要，托儿所、幼儿园的工作得到大大地发展。现在基本上每个人民公社内每个生产队都有托儿所和幼儿园，妇女劳动力得到很大的解放。例如江苏省溧阳县别桥乡湖塘社的妇女，过去因孩子牵累，出勤率一般在百分之四十左右，自从大跃进以来，办了托儿所、幼儿园，妇女出勤率达到百分之百。有了托儿所、幼儿园，由于有专人管理，也保证了孩子的安全，消灭了由于没人照顾而造成淹死孩子或其他伤亡事故，大人也就安心生产了。现将我们在视察中所看到的，有关幼儿园教养工作方面，扼要汇报如下：
    一、关心孩子们的健康成长。我们所看到的幼儿园小朋友，都是活泼愉快，小脸红红胖胖，十分精神。这是因为他们在幼儿园里比在家里吃得好，生活得好。当人民公社宰猪的时候，党委和社员们首先想到的是孩子，他们把猪肉、猪油、猪肝先送给幼儿园。农村里新鲜的蔬菜，尽孩子们吃。有些幼儿园设有幼儿食堂，还有些幼儿园的孩子是在人民公社的食堂同大人一起吃饭的。食堂的炊事员们总是千方百计地给孩子做些可口的饭食。孩子们在幼儿园的生活是有规律的。他们按时进餐，按时游戏上课，按时休息。这种有规律的生活，对他们的健康，自然有很大的好处。还有，人民公社都有医疗保健站，保健站的医生护士经常到幼儿园检查孩子们的健康和进行疾病治疗。父母们都感激地说：“过去我们在田里劳动，真是人在田头心在家，孩子在家里，冷一口热一口，饥一顿饿一顿，病了也没处去看。今天有了幼儿园，我们甚么都放心了，真是毛主席共产党好，人民公社好，我们一辈子也忘不了。”
    二、注意孩子的教育。人民公社的党委极关心第二代的教育。首先，他们对幼儿园师资的挑选是很慎重的。一般的幼儿园教师，都是经过群众推荐，社支部审查。挑选的条件是：政治可靠，热爱孩子，对孩子耐心，有初小或高小的文化程度，年龄在二十至三十岁之间，身体健康，性情活泼。由于这些教师还缺乏幼儿教育的专业知识，党委为她们组织各种训练班，使她们有学习的机会。她们都积极学习，认真钻研，想办法使孩子的生活丰富，有礼貌、爱劳动、会帮助别人。其次，公社党委对孩子的教育是极为注意的。有些公社的幼儿园还特辟菜园，饲养牛、羊、猪、兔、鸡、鸭、鹅等，每天由教师领着孩子拔草喂养这些动物，在园地里除野草。每天劳动的时间仅限于二十分钟。这些活动使孩子们感到很大的兴趣，他们不但初步获得有关动植物生长的知识，而且初步养成了劳动的习惯。有些公社的党委，亲自为孩子们编歌谣。幼儿园的教师们更用本乡的模范人物的事迹编成故事。这些故事由于是孩子生活里接触到的，他们也听到家里人谈论过的，就更易于对他们起教育的作用。为了使孩子们的生活丰富，党委和教师们都积极为孩子们准备玩具教具。有些党委自己亲手创作玩具。党委带头发动了群众、小学教师和小学生也为幼儿园的孩子们制造玩具。有些人民公社的社员大会上，党委发动全体社员，每人为幼儿园做一件玩具。教师们更想尽办法利用废物和当地生产的一些竹子、丝瓜络、木头、贝壳等等给孩子们做玩具。群众把家里的火柴盒、线轴、碎皮也积攒起来送给幼儿园做玩具。孩子们有得可玩，就更喜欢幼儿园，并且用玩具做各种游戏，也得到了教育。
    三、发扬了共产主义的协作精神，人人都关心孩子。人民公社里，在党委的领导下，人人都关心孩子。在群众的支持下，幼儿园可以花极少的钱就办起来了。因为可以利用公房或民房，群众帮助修理打扫，幼儿园的用具，可以向群众借，大家都到食堂吃饭了，一些厨房用具和饭桌都可以借给幼儿园。有些社员甚至把门板都卸下来给幼儿园的孩子们做床。江苏省溧阳县的河口乡，全乡五十二个幼儿园，在建园中用了不到一元钱的就有四十九个，干部群众都积极拥护这种多快好省的办园方法。在幼儿园建成之后，妇女干部经常关心幼儿园的需要。小学教师更关心辅导幼儿园教师的业务。有些地方有公立的幼儿园，这些公立幼儿园的教师的业务水平较高，她们都主动地对人民公社的民办幼儿园，进行具体的帮助。如四川省安岳县的公立幼儿园与民办幼儿园并班进行教学，带动了民办幼儿园的教师，充分发扬了协作的精神。
    人民公社给孩子们带来的幸福，是几千年来中国所没有的，也是目前资本主义国家所不可能有的。由于有了人民公社，生产力高度地发展起来，才可能大量地发展幼儿园，才可能给孩子那么丰富的营养和保健。由于人民公社能够统一调配劳动力，这才可能选配许多合格的幼儿教师关心孩子的教育。人民公社化也改变了人们的精神面貌，大家发扬了共产主义协作的精神，给幼儿以无限的关怀。
    我们虽然在不同的工作岗位，在不同的地区进行视察，但我们深深体会到我国的幼儿教育事业，在党的关怀下，在社会发展的要求下，已成为人民福利事业不可缺少的环节。在党的领导下，全国各地一定还有极多的幼儿教育工作的宝贵经验，我们希望有关部门将这些经验收集整理，使幼儿教育工作者互相学习。我们自己更应当认真学习毛主席的著作和党的方针政策，不断向优秀的幼儿教育工作者学习，改造思想，同全国的幼儿教育工作者一起，在党的领导下，为办好幼儿教育工作而努力。
    现在，我们对西藏叛乱事件发表一点意见。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的背叛祖国的罪行是十分可耻的。最近印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，是极为谎谬无耻的捏造，是干涉我国内政的行为，是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。西藏是我国的一部分，平息西藏叛乱是全国各族人民的意愿。我们完全相信在中国共产党的领导下，在全国各族人民的帮助下，经过西藏人民的努力，一定可以把西藏建设成人间乐园。印度干涉者的阴谋，一定遭到可耻的失败。
