Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:
    I fully agree with and warmly support the various reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. I would now like to give a brief report to the assembly on the socialist transformation of handicrafts in our country, and I welcome criticism and corrections.
    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, our country has achieved decisive victories in the socialist revolution on all fronts. In terms of the socialist transformation of handicrafts, the collective ownership of the means of production has replaced the individual ownership of handicraftsmen, thus resolving the contradictions within handicraftsmen arising from individual ownership and the contradictions between the individual handicraft economy and the socialist planned economy.
    Our country is a country with very developed handicrafts. Handicraft production has a long history and a broad mass base. The handicraft industry is complex, with a wide variety of products; there are both manufacturing and repair service industries; there are both means of production and means of subsistence; there are both general daily necessities and exquisite and beautiful arts and crafts; it plays a significant role in serving agricultural production, national industrial construction, the needs of urban and rural people's lives, and export needs.
    Since the national liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, while actively supporting handicraft production and giving full play to its role in the national economy, have also actively and systematically guided the scattered and backward individual handicrafts to gradually develop in the direction of collectivization and modernization. After the pilot projects, universal development, and the all-round cooperativization upsurge in 1956, more than 90 percent of the country's handicraftsmen have been organized, basically completing the task of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production in handicrafts. The rectification, consolidation, and socialist education movement from 1957 to the first half of 1958 also enabled the national handicraft cooperatives to achieve great victories in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, greatly enhancing the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of members. The national handicraft output value in 1957, the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, reached 13.3 billion yuan, an increase of 83 percent over 1952, exceeding the First Five-Year Plan by 13.6 percent. At the same time, the quality of handicraft products has greatly improved, the variety of designs and colors has increased, and production costs have also been reduced considerably.
    In the ten years of socialist transformation of handicrafts, we have deeply realized that we must pay attention to both large and advanced things, as well as small and backward things. The great achievements in the socialist transformation of handicrafts have shattered the erroneous ideas of those who advocated only modern large-scale industry and believed that handicrafts were scattered, backward, and would be eliminated sooner or later. It fully proves the correctness of the policy of "walking on two legs" put forward by the CPC Central Committee, which is based on giving priority to the development of heavy industry, while implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the simultaneous development of heavy and light industries, the simultaneous development of central and local industries, the simultaneous development of large and small enterprises, and the simultaneous development of indigenous and foreign methods of production. Our country's handicrafts are an important component of local industry. It accounts for a considerable proportion of light industry. It is a small and medium-sized enterprise mainly based on indigenous production methods. It is rooted in the masses of the people and in turn serves the masses of the people, and therefore has great vitality. After the cooperativization of handicrafts, in general, after three to five years of development, as long as they are diligent and thrifty, self-reliant, they can develop from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, from low-level to high-level, and develop into a modernized industrial enterprise of considerable scale. Practice has proved that handicraft cooperatives and factories are a good foundation for developing local industry. Using their existing manpower, material resources, and financial resources to develop local state-owned enterprises can achieve "less investment, faster construction, and greater results." This can not only avoid the difficulties of starting from scratch, but also achieve twice the result with half the effort. After the rural handicraft cooperatives were merged into the people's communes, they have also naturally become the backbone of the development of commune industry, because doing so is much easier than starting from scratch and starting from the beginning.
    After the handicraft organizations are organized, the labor productivity is greatly improved compared with individual households, but it is far lower than that of modern industrial enterprises. For example, taking the average annual output value per person in 1957, the handicraft cooperative was 2,194 yuan, equivalent to 202 percent of the 1,086 yuan of individual handicrafts, but only 18.2 percent of the 12,049 yuan of large state-owned industries. It can be seen that collective handicrafts must develop towards semi-mechanization and mechanization under possible conditions, and labor productivity must evolve. Otherwise, it will not be able to meet the requirements of the development of the entire national economy. In 1958, the national handicraft cooperatives and factories, on the basis of the victory of anti-waste and anti-conservatism in the later period of rectification, launched a technical revolution movement centered on improving tools and equipment, mainly relying on self-reliance. The enthusiasm of the masses was inspired, and the momentum was soaring, so that the output value of semi-mechanized and mechanized products in handicraft cooperatives and factories increased from less than 9 percent in 1957 to more than 30 percent. Experience has proved that this is completely necessary and completely possible.
    1958 was a year of comprehensive, national, and great leap forward in China's socialist construction. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the national handicraft cooperatives played an active role in serving agricultural production, national industrial construction, urban and rural people's lives, and export trade. In this year, handicraft cooperatives not only made a leap forward in production, but also greatly accelerated the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. By the end of 1958, of the 5.3 million members of the 104,000 handicraft cooperatives in the country, about 85 percent of the total number of people had been transferred to factories for transition, of which those directly transferred to local state-owned factories accounted for 48 percent of the total number of people transferred to factories, those transferred through cooperative factories accounted for 22 percent, and those transferred to people's commune factories accounted for 30 percent. In this way, the historical task of the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people has been basically completed in the national handicraft cooperatives. This is another victory of decisive significance in the socialist transformation of handicrafts in our country.
    The transition of handicraft cooperatives to ownership by the whole people in our country has taken two or three years, starting with pilot projects in the autumn of 1956. "The melon is ripe, and the water flows into the ditch," there must be a development process, otherwise haste makes waste. The reason why the transition of handicraft cooperatives from collective to the whole people can be so smoothly developed is by no means accidental. It is the inevitable result of the maturity of the internal and external conditions of handicraft cooperatives, and it is determined by the law that the relations of production must be suitable for the development of productive forces.
    Once handicraft laborers are organized, after a development process from small to large and from low to high, the collective ownership of the relations of production is constantly consolidated and improved, thus powerfully promoting the development of productive forces. Because handicrafts are a part of industry, and the modern state-owned enterprises owned by the whole people account for an absolute advantage in China's industry. Although the production and cooperation relationship between handicraft cooperatives and state-owned industry is very close, the handicraft cooperatives are limited by collective ownership, and some new problems have arisen in the unified arrangement of the socialist economic plan in terms of the unified arrangement of supply, production, and sales and basic construction, and in the unified deployment and rational use of funds, equipment, labor, and technical forces. After the full cooperativization of handicrafts, some cooperatives that have been established for a long time, are larger in scale, have more accumulation, and have a higher degree of mechanization, have appeared with the situation that the relations of production are somewhat unsuitable for the productive forces. Especially after the formation of the situation of the comprehensive great leap forward in 1958, in order to implement the "five simultaneous developments" and a whole set of "walking on two legs" policies of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the state needs handicraft cooperatives to expand and rebuild, as the basis for developing local industry; rural people's communes also need handicraft cooperatives to rapidly develop as the backbone of commune industrialization. Under this new situation, the phenomenon that the two ownership systems of socialist industry in our country are not adapted to each other in terms of production, exchange, and distribution has become increasingly obvious. If it is not resolved in time, it will affect the overall arrangement of the state planned economy to a certain extent, and it will also affect the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. In this way, the transition of handicraft cooperatives from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people has become an inevitable development trend of the socialist economic system.
    There are two kinds of ownership in socialism, namely ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Socialist collective ownership is good, but socialist ownership by the whole people is even better. It is incorrect to mechanically oppose the two kinds of socialist ownership, thinking that they are irreconcilable contradictions; similarly, it is also extremely wrong to only take care of the local, not the whole, and one-sidedly emphasize the interests of collective ownership, while not paying attention to the expansion and strengthening of the factors of ownership by the whole people. Things are always developing. The collective ownership economy has grown stronger, and it will inevitably develop towards ownership by the whole people. This is the transformation of contradictions. After several years of development, handicraft cooperatives have created a certain material basis for the transition to ownership by the whole people. In 1958, due to diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, the national handicraft cooperative system accumulated its own funds of about 2.5 billion yuan; it owned about 120,000 sets of various machines and power equipment, and the speed of mechanization was also accelerating; and it also accumulated a lot of experience in production management, and cultivated more than 300,000 management cadres with a certain political and professional level. With the development of production, the degree of public ownership is constantly improving. In 1958, the proportion of member shares in the total own funds of the cooperative was less than 4 percent, and the distribution ratio of labor dividends in the surplus was gradually reduced from 35 percent to about 10 percent.
    In terms of the political ideology and mental outlook of the vast number of members, significant changes have also taken place after socialist and communist education. The handicraftsmen in our country were poor and blank, had little means of production, had high revolutionary enthusiasm, and the original small private owner's thinking was constantly transformed after cooperativization, overcoming conservative and backward thinking in the collective training; the capitalist management thinking and style were eradicated under the management system of socialist enterprises. Especially after the rectification and consolidation movement in 1957, the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of members soared to an unprecedented level, the sense of honor of the working class was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and they were no longer satisfied with the "small world" of collective ownership, and demanded to "go to a higher level" and transition to ownership by the whole people. Under the guidance of the unified thinking of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on continuous revolution and the theory of the stage of revolutionary development, according to the improvement of the production development level and the mass consciousness level of the cooperative, grasping the opportunity, guiding according to the situation, and transitioning to ownership by the whole people in a timely manner not only conforms to the wishes of millions of handicraft laborers, but also fully conforms to the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    After the handicraft cooperatives were transferred to factories for transition, the relations of production were completely changed. Because the new relations of production were more suitable for the development of productive forces, ownership by the whole people was superior to collective ownership in all aspects. This is mainly:
    (1) The original funds, equipment, labor force, and technical force can be uniformly adjusted and rationally used in a larger range, which is more conducive to tapping production potential;
    (2) The supply of raw materials and the sale of products are directly incorporated into the state plan, which is conducive to breaking the limitations of economic types or ownership, making overall arrangements according to industry, rationally adjusting the division of labor of products, and closely cooperating and coordinating the various industrial sectors;
    (3) The state can fully utilize the original foundation of the handicraft cooperatives, conduct economic reorganization and investment expansion in a planned way, and develop local industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results;
    (4) After some handicraft cooperatives are transferred to people's commune factories, the original production and sales contradictions between rural handicrafts and agricultural and sideline industries are fundamentally eliminated, which is conducive to the combination of industry and agriculture, developing self-sufficiency and commodity production, and realizing the industrialization of the commune;
    (5) After more than 4 million people were transferred to factories for transition, labor dividends were abolished and all were changed to the wage system, making the income of the vast number of members more guaranteed; it encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm and spirit of research, accelerated the process of the technical revolution, that is, accelerated the speed of national industrialization.
    (6) Replenished the leading backbone, implemented the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, and improved the original rules and regulations, so that leadership and management are more adapted to the needs of production development.
    All of these, in the final analysis, have promoted the leap-forward development of productive forces. In 1958, the national handicraft output value increased by more than 70 percent compared with 1957, and the speed of growth far exceeded any year after liberation, approaching the sum of the first five-year plan. On the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, it is completely guaranteed to complete and overfulfill the national plan indicators for 1959.
    Our country is a multi-ethnic country. The unity and prosperity of the motherland is the highest interest of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. In the development process of the socialist transformation of handicrafts in our country, the National Handicraft Cooperative General Association has always paid attention to and cared about the development of handicraft production and the

### 手工业合作社向全民所有制过渡的历史任务已经基本完成  邓洁委员的发言

　　手工业合作社向全民所有制过渡的历史任务已经基本完成
    邓洁委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并热烈地拥护周恩来总理，李富春、李先念副总理，彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的各项报告。现在就我国手工业社会主义改造工作向大会作一简要汇报，请予批评指正。
    在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，我国在各个战线上的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。在手工业社会主义改造方面，已经用生产资料的集体所有制代替了手工业者的个体所有制，从而解决了由于个体所有制而产生的手工业者内部的矛盾和手工业个体经济同社会主义计划经济之间的矛盾。
    我国是一个手工业非常发达的国家，手工业生产有悠久的历史和广泛的群众基础。手工业行业复杂，品种多种多样；既有制造性的行业又有修理服务性的行业；既有生产资料，又有生活资料；既有一般的日常生活用品，又有精致美观的工艺美术品；在为农业生产、国家工业建设、城乡人民生活需要和出口需要服务等方面起着重大的作用。
    全国解放以来，中国共产党和人民政府在积极扶持手工业生产、充分发挥它在国民经济中的作用的同时，又积极地、有步骤地引导分散、落后的个体手工业，逐步向集体化、现代化的方向发展。经过典型试办、普遍发展和一九五六年的全面合作化高潮，全国有百分之九十以上的手工业者已经组织起来，基本上完成了手工业生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命的任务。一九五七年至一九五八年上半年的整风、整社和社会主义教育运动，又使全国手工业合作社，在政治战线和思想战线的社会主义革命方面取得了伟大胜利，大大地提高了广大社员的政治觉悟和生产积极性。第一个五年计划最后一年——一九五七年的全国手工业产值达到一百三十三亿元，比一九五二年增长百分之八十三，超额百分之十三点六完成了第一个五年计划。与此同时，手工业产品的质量有很大提高，增加了许多花色品种，生产成本也降低不少。
    在十年的手工业社会主义改造工作中，我们深深体会到：既要重视大的、先进的事物，也要重视小的、落后的事物。手工业社会主义改造所取得的伟大成就，打破了那些主张只搞现代化的大工业，而认为手工业分散落后，迟早要淘汰的错误思想，充分证明了中共中央所提出的在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工业与农业并举、重工业与轻工业并举、中央工业与地方工业并举、大型企业与中小型企业并举、土法生产与洋法生产并举的两条腿走路的方针的正确性。我国手工业是地方工业的一个重要组成部分，它在轻工业中占有相当大的比重，它是以土法生产为主的中小型企业，它生根在人民群众当中，反过来又为人民群众服务，因而具有伟大的生命力。手工业合作化以后，一般经过三年、五载的发展，只要克勤克俭，自力更生，就可以由小到大、由土到洋、由低级到高级，发展成为一个具有相当规模的近代化工业企业。实践证明，手工业合作社、厂是发展地方工业的良好基础。利用它们现有的人力、物力和财力来发展地方国营企业，可以作到“投资少、建设快、收效大”，这样，不仅可以免除另起炉灶的困难，而且可以收到事半功倍的效果。农村的手工业合作社并入人民公社以后，也已很自然地成为发展公社工业的骨干力量，因为这样做要比白手起家、从头干起容易得多。
    手工业组织起来后，劳动生产率虽比个体户大为提高，但远远低于现代化的工业企业。如拿一九五七年每人平均年产值来说，手工业合作社是二千一百九十四元，相当于个体手工业一千零八十六元的百分之二百零二，但只及国营大工业一万二千零四十九元的百分之一十八点二。由此可见，集体化的手工业要在可能的条件下向半机械化、机械化方向发展，劳动生产率必须进化。否则，就不能适应整个国民经济发展的要求。一九五八年全国手工业合作社、厂，在整风后期反浪费、反保守胜利的基础上，以自力更生为主，开展了一个以改进工具设备为中心的技术革命运动，群情振奋，干劲冲天，使手工业合作社、厂中半机械化、机械化的产值由一九五七年的不足百分之九上升到百分之三十以上。经验证明，这样作是完全必要的，也是完全可能的。
    一九五八年，是我国社会主义建设全面的全民的大跃进的一年。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，全国手工业合作社在为农业生产、国家工业建设、城乡人民生活和出口贸易服务等方面发挥了积极作用。在这一年中，手工业合作社不仅在生产上有了飞跃发展，而且大大地加速了由集体所有制向全民所有制的过渡。到一九五八年底，全国十万零四千多个手工业合作社的五百三十多万社员，已经转厂过渡的约占总人数的百分之八十五左右，其中直接过渡为地方国营工厂的占转厂过渡总人数的百分之四十八，经过合作工厂再过渡的占百分之二十二，转为人民公社工厂的占百分之三十。这样，全国手工业合作社由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡的历史任务已经基本完成。这是我国手工业社会主义改造又一次具有决定性意义的胜利。
    我国手工业合作社向全民所有制过渡，从一九五六年秋季开始试点算起，已经有两三年的时间。“瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”，必须要有一个发展过程，否则欲速则不达。手工业合作社从集体向全民过渡，其所以能够获得如此顺利地发展，绝对不是偶然的。它是手工业合作社内部和外部条件成熟的必然结果，是生产关系一定要适合生产力发展的规律所决定的。
    手工业劳动者一经组织起来，经过由小到大、由低到高的发展过程，集体所有制的生产关系不断地得到巩固和提高，因而有力地推动了生产力的发展。由于手工业是工业的一部分，在我国工业中占绝对优势的是现代化的全民所有制的国营企业。手工业合作社与国营工业之间的生产协作关系虽然非常密切；但是，手工业合作社为集体所有制所局限，社会主义经济计划在供产销和基本建设的统一安排方面，在资金、设备、劳动力和技术力量的统一调配和合理使用方面，都发生了一些新的问题。在手工业实现全面合作化以后，已经有一部分成立较久、规模较大、积累较多、机械化程度较高的合作社，出现了生产关系同生产力某些不相适应的情况。尤其是一九五八年全面大跃进的局势形成以后，为了贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的“五个并举”等一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，国家需要手工业合作社进行扩建与改建，作为发展地方工业的基础；农村人民公社也需要手工业合作社迅速发展作为公社工业化的骨干。在这一新的形势下，我国社会主义工业两种所有制在生产、交换、分配方面不相适应的现象就日益明显了。如果不及时解决，将会在一定程度上影响国家计划经济的全面安排，也就会影响工农业生产大跃进。这样，手工业合作社从集体所有制向全民所有制过渡就成为社会主义经济制度必然的发展趋势。
    社会主义有两种所有制，即全民所有制和集体所有制。社会主义集体所有制好，但社会主义全民所有制更好。机械地把社会主义两种所有制对立起来，认为是不可调和的矛盾，是不正确的；同样，只顾局部，不顾整体，片面的强调集体所有制的利益，而不重视全民所有制因素的扩大和加强，也是极端错误的。事物总是不断发展的。集体所有制经济壮大了，必然会要向全民所有制发展。这就是矛盾的转化。手工业合作社经过几年来的发展，已经为向全民所有制过渡创造了一定的物质基础。一九五八年，全国手工业合作系统由于勤俭办社，积累了自有资金达二十五亿元左右；拥有各种机器和动力设备约十二万台，机械化的速度也日益加快；并且积累了不少生产管理的经验，培养了具有一定政治水平和业务水平的管理干部三十余万人。随着生产的发展，公有化程度不断提高。一九五八年，社员股金在合作社全部自有资金中的比重已经不足百分之四，劳动分红在盈余中的分配比例也从百分之三十五逐步降低到百分之十上下了。
    在广大社员的政治思想和精神面貌方面，经过社会主义和共产主义的教育，也起了显著的变化。我国手工业者一穷二白，占有生产资料少，革命积极性高，合作化后原有小私有者的思想不断得到改造，在集体主义锻炼中克服了保守落后思想；在社会主义企业的经营制度下根绝了资本主义经营思想和作风。特别是经过一九五七年的整风、整社运动，广大社员的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性空前高涨，工人阶级的光荣感深入人心，已经不满足于集体所有制的“小天地”，要求“更上一层楼”，向全民所有制过渡。在党中央和毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相统一的思想指导下，根据合作社生产发展水平和群众觉悟水平的提高，掌握时机，因势利导，适时地向全民所有制过渡，这不仅符合千百万手工业劳动者的愿望，也完全符合多快好省地建设社会主义的方针。
    手工业合作社转厂过渡以后，彻底改变了生产关系，由于新的生产关系更加适合生产力的发展，在各方面显示出全民所有制比集体所有制更为优越，这主要是：
    （一）原有的资金、设备、劳动力和技术力量，可以在更大的范围内进行统一调剂和合理使用，更便于挖掘生产潜力；
    （二）原料供应和产品销售直接纳入国家计划，便于打破经济类型或所有制的局限，按行业统筹安排，合理调整产品分工，密切各工业部门的协作和配合；
    （三）国家可以充分利用手工业合作社的原有基础，有计划地进行经济改组和投资扩建，多快好省地发展地方工业；
    （四）一部分手工业合作社转为人民公社工厂后，从根本上消除了原来农村手工业和农副业之间的产销矛盾，有利于工农业结合，发展自给性和商品性生产，实现公社工业化；
    （五）四百多万人转厂过渡以后，取消了劳动分红，全部改为工资制，广大社员成为工人阶级，使劳动者的收入更有保证；鼓舞了革命干劲和钻劲，加速了技术革命的进程，也就是加速了国家工业化的速度。
    （六）充实了领导骨干，实行了党委领导下的厂长负责制，改进了原有的规章制度，使领导和管理更加适应生产发展的需要。
    所有这些，归根到底都促进了生产力的飞跃发展。一九五八年全国手工业产值比一九五七年增长百分之七十以上，增长的速度远远超过解放后的任何一年，接近第一个五年计划的总和。在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，完成和超额完成一九五九年国家的计划指标，是完全有保证的。
    我国是一个多民族的国家。祖国的统一和繁荣是全国各民族人民的最高利益。在我国的手工业社会主义改造的发展过程中，全国手工业合作总社一贯地注意和关怀少数民族地区的手工业生产和手工业社会主义改造事业的发展。这些地区，如内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区、广西僮族自治区、宁夏回族自治区等，在当地党委和政府的领导下，都已经基本上完成了手工业社会主义改造任务。
    最近，西藏反动集团竟在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派的阴谋指示下，公开发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，破坏民族团结，妄想在西藏恢复帝国主义侵略势力，使西藏成为永远暗无天日的人间地狱。我们全体社员和手工业工作者，对西藏上层反动集团所干的这种滔天罪行表示极大愤慨，并完全拥护政府在西藏迅速平定叛乱和逐步实现改革任务的一切政策和措施。为了帮助西藏手工业的逐步改造，全国手工业合作总社已决定在人力、物力、财力等方面尽力予以支援。我们相信，在彻底消灭叛匪之后，西藏的全体手工业者，将在中国共产党西藏工委和西藏自治区筹备委员会的领导下，同西藏全体人民一道，进入一个新的历史发展阶段，为共同把西藏高原建设成为一个民主的、进步的、繁荣的社会主义乐园而贡献自己的力量。
