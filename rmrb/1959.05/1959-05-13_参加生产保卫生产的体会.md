Experiences in Participating in Production to Protect Production
Sun Jiaxing, Adjudicator, People's Court of Lishu County, Jilin Province

    1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in national political and legal work. During the high tide of the Great Steel Campaign, I responded to the Party's call, taking on the task assigned by the leadership to protect steel production and plunged into the battle of steel production. At that time, although the production tasks were very heavy, I always paid attention to combining production with judicial work to protect the smooth progress of steel production. The steel plant where I was located was the only steel base in the county, and the steel workers came from all corners of the county. Some were temporarily recruited from other places, and the composition of personnel was also relatively complex. Therefore, the task of protecting steel production seemed even more arduous. After discussing with the steel plant's Party committee and the security department, we established security sections in each team and added security officers to each group.
    On October 30th last year, just as the factory was launching a "satellite," a thief, Luo Yujiang, took the opportunity to steal the oil pipe from a diesel engine. Seeing that the furnace was about to be lit for production, I discovered that the oil pipe was stolen. I hurriedly called the relevant departments and sent people to intercept him. That day, the criminal was captured at the railway crossing in Guojiadian Street. With the approval of the Party committee, a meeting of more than a hundred people was organized at the scene of the theft, with representatives selected from each team. I publicly tried the case and sentenced the defendant to three years in prison. In order to widely educate the masses and prevent such cases from happening again, in addition to the representatives of each team conveying the sentencing situation, more than 300 large-character posters of the judgment were printed and distributed to each team, and workers were organized to hold discussions.
    During this period, I handled a total of eight cases of corruption, theft, and counter-revolutionary rumor-mongering, thereby protecting the smooth progress of steel production. In handling these cases, I used my lunch break to conclude four cases. Because legal education was carried out in connection with the problems that occurred in production, after publicly handling several cases, no more theft incidents occurred. From then on, the workers were able to concentrate on production.
    In terms of production, when I first arrived, I knew nothing about building furnaces, smelting iron, and other production-related issues. At that time, the Party committee required that six blast furnaces be built and put into production within ten days. Although the task was very heavy, I thought that nothing is impossible to a willing mind. If you don't understand, learn; this is the only way to solve the problem. So I went to units that had built furnaces earlier to visit and learn. After building and learning at the same time, I finally mastered the basic knowledge of building furnaces. The first furnace was finally completed, and then six blast furnaces were built one after another and put into production on time. Later, I was assigned to do material supply and transportation work. Because there were few vehicles at that time, and coke was urgently needed for coal, the supply could not keep up, and the number of vehicles could not be increased. Under such urgent circumstances, after learning that some drivers had ideological problems, I organized the drivers to have discussions and further researched with the workers, creating the safe box coal transportation method and the live-car plank unloading method. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of coal transportation speed at night, four lanterns were made, one for each team. This not only accelerated the driving speed but also avoided driving risks. After this improvement, the transportation efficiency increased from the original five trips per vehicle per day to eight trips; each vehicle originally loaded half a ton, increasing to one ton to one and a half tons, doubling the transportation volume, and saving the country more than 16 tons of coal. Because coal was supplied in a timely manner, the production efficiency of coke was also improved accordingly, which directly ensured the completion of the iron-smelting production task. As a result, it was commended by the Steel Headquarters.
    Through this participation in steel production labor, I realized that participating in production labor on the one hand, and protecting production on the other, promoting the smooth progress of production, is a very important working method for our judicial cadres. Participating in physical labor is also a way to cultivate and exercise our thinking, to be both red and expert. After returning to work at the court, I always wanted to do some physical labor. When I saw that the desks and benches in the court were broken, or other tools were damaged, if I could fix them, I would do it myself. When the court building leaked rain, I would go to the roof to repair the tiles myself. I think that repairing things myself can save the country expenses on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can cultivate my labor habits. Once, I was building a partition in the outer room of the office, and a party involved in a case came in and asked if the "judge" was in. I asked him what was the matter and he could talk to me about it. The party saw that I was doing carpentry work and didn't look like an adjudicator, so he ignored me and went straight to the office. After the assessor received him, he felt that he was not sure about the problem and came to ask me. At this time, the party involved realized that I was the adjudicator of the court. He said in surprise: "The current judges can still do this kind of work, it's really amazing!"
    Since the Great Leap Forward, I have deeply realized that if an adjudicator wants to complete his task well and handle cases correctly, he must establish a mass viewpoint, care about the production and suffering of the masses, and contact the masses as an ordinary worker; only in this way can he be welcomed by the masses and understand the real situation. When I worked in the countryside, I handled cases when there were cases, and participated in production labor when there were no cases. During the busy farming season, I worked with the farmers, while working and understanding the situation. I feel in my actual work that participating in labor is an important working method for contacting the masses, investigating cases, and ensuring the correct handling of cases.

    参加生产保卫生产的体会
    吉林省梨树县人民法院审判员  孙家兴
    1958年是全国政法工作大跃进的一年。在大搞钢铁运动高潮期间，我响应了党的号召，带着领导上交给我的保卫钢铁生产的任务，投入了钢铁生产战斗。在当时，生产任务虽然很重，但我时刻注意结合生产进行审判业务工作，保卫钢铁生产的顺利进行。我所在的钢铁厂是全县的唯一钢铁基地，钢铁工人来自全县各个角落，其中有的是从外地临时招来的，人员成分也比较复杂。因此，保卫钢铁生产的任务就更显得繁重了。我和钢铁厂党委和保卫处研究后，就在各队建立了保卫科，各组增设了保卫员。
    去年10月30日，正当厂里放“卫星”时，盗窃分子骆玉江乘机将柴油机上的输油管盗走了。眼看就要点炉生产，发现输油管被盗走，我急忙打电话与有关部门联系并派人截堵。当天就在郭家店街铁道口将罪犯捉回。经过党委批准，在被盗现场，由各队选派了代表，组织了百余人的大会，我公开审理了这个案件，当庭判处被告三年徒刑。为了广泛教育群众，杜绝这类案件的发生，除了各队代表传达宣判情况外，事后又印发了三百多张大字判决书发给各队，组织民工进行座谈。
    在这段期间，我一共处理了八起贪污、盗窃和反革命造谣煽动的案件，从而保卫了钢铁生产的顺利进行。在处理这些案件中，我利用中午休息时间，审结了四起。由于结合生产上发生的问题，进行了守法教育，所以在公开处理了几件案件后，再也没有发生盗窃事件。从此，民工也就安心生产了。
    在生产方面，刚去的时候，我对建炉、炼铁等生产方面的问题，什么都不懂。当时党委要求十天内必须建立起六座高炉并投入生产。任务虽然很重，可是我想天下无难事，就怕有心人，不懂就学，这是解决问题的唯一办法。于是我就到建炉早的单位去拜访学习。经过边建边学，终于掌握了建炉的基本知识。第一座炉终于落成，接着六座高炉都相继建设起来，按时投入了生产。以后分配我做物资供应和运输工作，因当时车少，炼焦又急需用煤，供应不上，车又不能增加，在这样紧迫的情况下，经了解发现个别司机思想上还有些问题，我就组织司机进行座谈，并和工人们进一步研究，创造了安全箱运煤法和活车铺板卸煤法。同时为了解决夜间运煤速度问题，制作四个灯笼，每小队一个。这不但加快了行车速度，也避免了行车危险。经过这段改进，使运输效率由原来每台车每日拉五车提高到八车；每车原装半吨提高到一吨至一吨半，使运输量翻了一番，同时给国家节省煤十六吨多。由于煤炭得到了及时供应，焦炭生产效率也随之提高了，这样就直接保证了炼铁生产任务的完成。由此受到了钢铁司令部的表扬。
    通过这次参加钢铁生产劳动，我体会到：一面参加生产劳动，一面保卫生产，促进生产的顺利进行，是我们司法干部一个很重要的工作方法。参加体力劳动，也是培养和锻炼自己思想、又红又专的一个途径。回到法院工作后，我还总想要干些体力活。我看到法院的办公桌凳坏了，或者其他工具破了，能干的，就自己动手修理一下。法院房子漏了雨，我就自己上房串瓦修补。我想，自己动手修理，一方面能给国家节省开支，另一方面也能使自己养成劳动习惯。有一次，我正在办公室外屋打间壁，有一位当事人进屋就问“法官”在屋没有。我问他有啥事可以和我说说。这位当事人看我正在做木匠活，不像个审判员的样子，没理我，就直奔办公室去了。陪审员接待后，感到对问题没有把握，即来问我。这时，当事人才知道我是法庭的审判员，他惊奇地说：“现在的法官还能干这活，可真了不起！”
    大跃进以来，我深深地体会到：一个审判员要想很好地完成自己的任务，正确处理案件，就必须树立群众观点，关心群众的生产和疾苦，以一个普通劳动者的身份去接触群众；这样才能为群众所欢迎，才能了解到真实情况。我在乡下工作的时候，有案就办案件，没案就参加生产劳动，在农忙的时候就和农民一起干活，一边干活一边了解情况。我在实际工作中感觉到参加劳动是联系群众，调查案情，保证正确处理案件的重要工作方法。
