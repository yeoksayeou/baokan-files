Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th - Cultural relics and historic sites in Lhasa are now well protected, and the lamas in the monasteries are also living normal religious lives.

During the suppression of the rebellion under orders, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa made the greatest effort to protect cultural relics and historic sites everywhere. As soon as the rebellion was quelled, the Lhasa Military Control Commission issued an order in its first proclamation to protect cultural relics and historic sites, and established a Historical Relics Management Committee to be responsible for the protection and management of cultural relics and historic sites throughout the city.

At present, the antiquities in the Jokhang Temple, such as King Gesar's armor, the ancient zither from the Tang Dynasty, and the gold-boxed wine vessel used by Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo, are all well preserved. The twenty-odd gold lamps that Princess Wencheng brought from Chang'an and placed in front of the statue of Sakyamuni are now brightly lit, and the lamas chant scriptures in prayer morning and evening. Under the Tang willow tree at the gate of the Jokhang Temple, many Lamaist believers turn prayer wheels and worship every day.

The antiquities, Buddha statues, and the stupas of successive Dalai Lamas in the Potala Palace are all well preserved in their original state. No one has touched the four large locks on the door of the "Lang Kangze" treasury, where the Dalai Lama stores jewels and jade. The lamas in the palace still offer sacrifices and prayers in front of the Buddha statues according to traditional religious rituals.

The eighty-three precious colored scroll paintings of animals, plants, minerals, and human anatomy stored in the Tibetan Medicine College of Mount Yakwang are also completely intact.

The three major monasteries of Lhasa are still magnificent. The "Gadan Phodrang" of Drepung Monastery is where the Dalai Lama resides when he goes to worship Buddha, and there are still yellow curtains and Dharma seats there.

The lawns, canals, and flower beds in Norbulingka have been renovated. The Dalai Lama's new palace is still under the care of the original "Shengga" (guards) Pema Qunpei and Awang Renzha. Sutras and Buddhist instruments are also stored in their original state. The "Tse-nyi Baika" (the classic for research and debate), which the Dalai Lama often read in the past year or two, has been carefully wrapped in silk and placed in a glass bookcase.

　　拉萨文物古迹保护妥善  喇嘛过着正常宗教生活
    新华社拉萨8日电　拉萨市的文物古迹现在保护得很好，寺庙里的喇嘛也在过着正常的宗教生活。
    驻拉萨人民解放军在奉令讨平叛乱过程中，都尽最大力量保护各处的文物古迹。叛乱一平息，拉萨市军管会就在第一号布告里下达了保护文物古迹的命令，并成立了历史文物管理委员会，负责保护和管理全市的文物古迹。
    现在，大昭寺中的古物，如格萨王的盔甲、唐代的古琴和藏王松赞干布使用过的装在金盒里的酒樽等，都保存得很好。文成公主当年从长安带来的放在释迦牟尼像前的二十多盏金灯，现在灯火通明，喇嘛们早晚祈祷诵经。大昭寺大门口的唐柳树下，每天有许多喇嘛教徒在转经朝拜。
    布达拉宫里的古物、佛像和历世达赖喇嘛的灵塔，都很好地保持原来的样子。达赖喇嘛贮藏珠宝玉器的“朗更泽”内库门上的四把大锁，没有人去动过它。宫内的喇嘛们仍按传统的宗教仪式在佛像前上供祝愿。
    存放在药王山藏医学院的八十三幅珍贵的动植物、矿物和人体解剖的彩色卷轴画，也都完整无缺。
    拉萨三大寺依然金碧辉煌。哲蚌寺“噶丹颇章”是达赖喇嘛去朝佛时居住的地方，现在那里仍陈设着黄幔和法座。
    罗布林卡里的草坪、水渠和花坛都被整理一新。达赖喇嘛的新宫，还是由原来的“圣噶”（侍卫官）白玛群佩和阿旺仁扎在看管。经书、佛器也是按原来的样子存放着。达赖喇嘛近一两年来经常阅读的“泽尼白卡”（研究辩论的经典）被妥善地用绸缎包裹起来，放入了玻璃书橱内。
