Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 27th: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto today condemned Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama's remarks about revising the US-Japan "Security Treaty" as a "lie to deceive the Japanese people."

Fujiyama, while explaining the issue of revising the "Security Treaty" at a meeting of the Security Treaty Issue Roundtable on the 25th, said, "This treaty will be revised within the scope of the United Nations Charter and the Japanese Constitution."

Miyamoto Kenji pointed out that the United States' interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon, China, and South American countries has proven that it does not respect the United Nations Charter.

Miyamoto also said that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's statement that "Japan possessing nuclear weapons and attacking foreign military bases is constitutional" is a complete disregard for the national constitution. U.S. troops stationed in Japan are already equipped with nuclear weapons.

Miyamoto also accused Fujiyama of attempting to gloss over the fact that the Kishi Nobusuke group is acting as an American partner with pleasant-sounding words such as "economic and political cooperation with the United States."

Miyamoto revealed that Fujiyama is trying to make the Japanese public believe that the entire treaty revision is as if Japan has greater "independence" from the United States. He pointed out that the purpose of Fujiyama's speech is to beautify the current negotiations on revising the treaty, thereby placing the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in an advantageous position.

Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki issued a statement pointing out that although Fujiyama said that the US-Japan "Security Treaty" would be revised within the scope of the Constitution, the stationing of foreign troops in Japan based on the "Security Treaty" is a violation of the Constitution, so this phenomenon should be eliminated as soon as possible.

Suzuki also said that the Japanese people cannot tolerate being bound by the US military in any way.

    宫本和铃木斥日外相美化日美谈判
    岸内阁充当美国走卒无法粉饰
    新华社27日讯  东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治今天谴责日本外务相藤山爱一郎关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈话是“欺骗日本人民的谎言”。
    藤山25日在安全条约问题恳谈会会议上解释修改“安全条约”问题时曾说，“这个条约将在联合国宪章和日本宪法的范围内修改”。
    宫本显治指出，美国干涉黎巴嫩、中国和南美国家内政的行为已经证明它不尊重联合国宪章。
    宫本还说，岸信介内阁说，“日本拥有核武器和进攻外国军事基地是合乎宪法的”，这是完全蔑视国家宪法的行为。美国驻日本的军队已经装备着核武器。
    宫本并且指责藤山企图以“同美国进行经济、政治合作”这种好听话来粉饰岸信介集团充当美国小伙伴的事实。
    宫本揭露藤山企图使日本公众认为整个修改条约的事仿佛是日本对美国有了更大的“独立”。他指出，藤山演说的目的在于美化目前关于修改条约的谈判，从而使执政的自由民主党处于有利地位。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎发表谈话指出，藤山虽然说要在宪法范围内修改日美“安全条约”，但是根据“安全条约”而在日本驻扎外国军队是违反宪法的，所以应该早日消除这种现象。
    铃木并且说，由美军来束缚日本是日本人民无论如何也不能忍受的。
