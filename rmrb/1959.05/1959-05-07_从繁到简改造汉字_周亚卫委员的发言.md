Committee Member Zhou Yawei's Speech: Transforming Chinese Characters from Complex to Simple

I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee presented by Vice Chairman Li Weihan. I support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft."

In the past six years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country has achieved brilliant successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction; we have victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and we are continuing the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of 1958 and the first quarter of this year; the social and natural landscape of the entire country has been completely renewed, with people's communes, land greening, water conservancy, garden-style fields, and industrialization of urban and rural areas everywhere, mechanization of production, everyone laboring, everyone learning, united and loving each other, and working with great enthusiasm; eating without paying, and the living standards of the masses have greatly improved. During this inspection, I heard and saw new products, new indicators, new inventions, new records, new constructions, new equipment, new atmospheres, and new people and new things. I am receiving new education from the Party, and I am also excited by the above-mentioned environment of universal renewal. Therefore, I am speaking at this conference of great unity and great leap forward to offer two issues for your guidance: one is the analysis and arrangement of characters for literacy work, and the other is the fundamental transformation of Chinese characters!

Literacy work and Chinese character reform are both work projects in the socialist cultural revolution of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Premier Zhou's government work report also pointed out that "mass literacy work should be actively promoted."

Currently, some places across the country are actively carrying out literacy work and have not yet completed it; most places have basically completed literacy work and are now in the final stage. In the final stage, many difficulties are generally felt, and the masses who had previously shed the title of illiterate are experiencing re-illiteracy. Therefore, we must pay attention to the issue of literacy and study and improve it from various aspects. Here, I will only talk about the analysis and arrangement of characters.

"Analysis and arrangement" is a general basic method for scientifically, dialectically, and systematically handling all people, places, things, and events in revolutionary undertakings, construction undertakings, and various work and social life. Literacy education—literacy work—is no exception; whether using reading books or character lessons, the new characters used should be prepared in advance for analysis and arrangement, establishing an order of "from simple to complex, from division to combination" for gradual progress.

The analysis and arrangement of Chinese characters begins with grading. Single-component characters are level one, and compound characters are divided into levels two, three, and even seven according to their construction process.

The analysis and arrangement of single-component characters can be done according to meaning classification, or by the number of strokes in order, or by dividing the sounds (initials, finals), or by the form of the starting stroke; appropriate application is needed.

First simple then complex, first division then combination, gradual progress, it is easy to teach, easy to learn, easy to recognize, easy to remember, and relatively able to consolidate. The ancients had said and done this, but it was not universal and there were no established rules. In practice, we are roughly moving in this direction now. However, we must clarify and complete this principle and method; we must adhere to it and promote it.

However, in the current Chinese characters, a large proportion of characters have various problems, not just complexity, but also hindering analysis and arrangement, difficult to distinguish, and impossible to explain. That is to say, the current Chinese characters cannot enter the path of science, cannot adapt to the learning, work, and life applications of the working people, and do not meet the requirements of socialist construction that is more, faster, better, and more economical. Therefore, Chinese characters must be fundamentally transformed. This is the second question.

The ideal goal of the fundamental transformation of Chinese characters should be "scientific organization and thorough simplification."

The problems of current Chinese characters and the requirements for transformation:

(1) The main problem—complexity

(1) Single-component characters have too many strokes, some with more than ten strokes, such as "鱼 (fish), 鸟 (bird), 龟 (turtle)," etc. On the one hand, they are too complex in themselves, and more seriously, they affect the compound characters formed by combining them, which have even more strokes. Therefore, the number of strokes in single-component characters must first be simplified as much as possible.

(2) Compound characters have too many construction levels. There are a large number of five- and six-level characters among commonly used characters. It is required to comprehensively reduce the number of levels of compound characters. (See the "Overview Table of Several Compound Characters" below, the same below.)

(3) Some compound characters contain too many components. Unnecessary components should be removed.

(2) Various miscellaneous problems, mostly existing in compound characters. It is required to reform, correct, or remedy them separately.

(1) "Meaning indication or phonetic indication are" missing and incomplete, hidden and not obvious.

(2) Several components are interwoven and interspersed.

(3) Variant forms. Such as "???" etc.

(4) Cooling characters, radicals, and even components in the components, such as "亠冖宀," etc.

(5) Some components have been disrupted by "Li Script change" and "Regular Script change."

(3) Some characters that reflect slave society and feudal society, and are seriously outdated in modern times, should be selectively changed. The most serious is that many bad people and bad things are from the female radical 女, such as "奸 (treacherous), 佞 (flattering), 嫉 (jealous), 妒 (envious)," etc., which are absolutely intolerable.

Chinese characters must be comprehensively and fundamentally transformed, and it is also possible to comprehensively and fundamentally transform them. It is estimated that by simplifying the strokes of single-component characters, reducing the levels of compound characters, and removing unnecessary components, the overall simplification can be reduced to less than half, or even more. The average number of strokes per character in the old commonly used characters was about eleven, which was only reduced slightly after the release of the three batches of simplified characters. After thorough simplification in the future, it is estimated that the average can be below six strokes, and the maximum number of strokes can be within ten strokes. In this way, the burden of learning and use will be reduced by half.

In addition, with scientific organization, each compound character is clearly divided and combined; in teaching, there is a gradual step of "first simple then complex, first division then combination," then recognition is easier and memory is more consolidated.

Only after Chinese characters have undergone fundamental transformation can they coexist with phonetic alphabets for a long time. Walking on two legs, combining native and foreign methods. Phonetic alphabets are based on hearing and supplemented by vision; they are simple and easy, convenient for mechanization, and most suitable for international circulation. Chinese characters are based on vision and supplemented by hearing; they have a long history of common development with the Chinese language, are rich in artistry, and are particularly able to fully undertake the task of inheriting the traditional cultural heritage.

The above two issues are closely related. However, the fundamental transformation of Chinese characters, from ideological preparation to concrete success, takes a considerable amount of time. For literacy work, in the current situation, it is beneficial to flexibly apply the principle of "from simple to complex, from division to combination" within the possible scope of the current situation.

The above opinions are all immature. Please give your guidance!

Regarding Tibet: I fully support the Party's policies and all the measures of the State Council. I pay tribute to the comrades of the Tibet Military Region and the People's Liberation Army in Tibet. I wish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and all Tibetan compatriots a victorious and successful democratic reform and the early realization of socialist construction. I advise the kind friends of India to adhere to the Panchsheel—the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—not to interfere in our internal affairs, and to take care of the Dalai Lama's early and safe return to our country. I warn the imperialist elements and expansionist elements: what you have done and said is all evil and reckless; you should get out of this situation as soon as possible! I warn the rebels and all reactionaries, do not continue to walk the dead end, turn back quickly! (Attached chart)

### 从繁到简改造汉字  周亚卫委员的发言

　　从繁到简改造汉字
    周亚卫委员的发言
    我完全同意李维汉副主席所作第二届常务委员会工作报告。我拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”。
    最近六年来，我们国家在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，社会主义革命和社会主义建设得到了辉煌的成就；胜利地提前超额完成了第一个五年计划，又继续着一九五八年和今年第一季度的全面大跃进；整个国家的社会面貌和自然面貌都焕然一新，处处人民公社化、土地绿化、水利化、园田化、城乡工业化、生产机械化，人人劳动、人人学习，团结友爱、干劲冲天；吃饭不要钱，群众的生活水平大大提高。在这次视察工作中，耳闻目见，都是新产品、新指标、新发明、新纪录、新建设、新装备、新风气、新气象、新人新事。我正在受党的新的教育之后，又受了以上这样万象皆新的环境激动，所以在这一个大团结的大会、大跃进的大会上发言，来向各位提供两个问题：一个是扫盲用字的分析排队问题，又一个是汉字的根本改造问题，请指教！
    扫盲工作和汉字改革，都是党的社会主义建设总路线社会主义文化革命中的工作项目。周总理的政府工作报告中，又指出“群众性的扫盲工作应该积极推行。”
    目前全国扫盲工作，有些地方正在积极进行，还没有完成；大部分的地方，基本上完成扫盲工作，现在是扫尾阶段。在扫尾工作中，普遍地感到有许多困难，并且，先前已经摘掉了文盲帽子的群众又发生有复盲现象。因此，我们对于扫盲问题还要加以注重，要从多方面来研究改进。我这里只就用字的分析排队方面来谈一谈。
    “分析、排队”这是在革命事业、建设事业和各种工作、各种社会生活中，科学地、辩证地、有组织有步骤地处理一切人地物事的一般基本方法。识字教育——扫盲工作，没有例外；不论用读本方式或字课方式，所用生字都应该先准备好分析排队，建立起“由简而繁、由分而合”循序渐进的秩序。
    汉字的分析排队，首先是分级。单体字是一级，复体字按照它构造的程序，分为二级、三级乃至七级。
    单体字的分析排队，可以按照意义分类、或是按笔画多少顺序，或是分音（纽、韵），或是依起头笔画形式；适当运用。
    先简后繁，先分后合，循序渐进，就容易教、容易学、容易认识、容易记忆、比较能够巩固。古人曾经说过做过，但是不普遍，没有成规。我们现在实际上大致也向着这个方向。只是，要把这一原则方法明确起来、完整起来；要坚持、要推广。
    可是，现在的汉字中，有很大部分的字存在着各种各样的毛病，不只是繁复而已，并且阻碍着分析排队，难分难辨，无从解释。也就是说，现在的汉字走不进科学的道路，不能适应劳动人民的学习、工作和生活应用，不符合于多快好省的社会主义建设要求。因此，汉字必须根本改造。这是第二个问题。
    汉字根本改造的理想目标，应该是“科学整理、彻底简化”。
    现在汉字的毛病和改造的要求：
    （第一）主要毛病——繁复
    （一）单体字笔画太多，有一些在十画以上，如“鱼鸟龟”等等。一面是它本身太繁，更严重的是影响到用它所结合成的复体字笔画更多。所以，单体字的笔画数，必须首先尽量精简。
    （二）复体字的构造级次太多。常用字中就有大量的五六级字。要求对复体字全面缩减级数。（参看后“几个复体字概见表”，下同。）
    （三）有一些复体字中所含的成分太多。其中不必要的，应该清除。
    （第二）各种杂病，多存在于复体字中。要求分别改革纠正或补救。
    （一）“某省”“某省声”，缺而不全，隐而不显。
    （二）几个成分交错穿插。
    （三）异体异形。如“????”等等。
    （四）成分中的冷却字，偏旁，甚至部首，如“亠冖宀”等等。
    （五）有些成分，被“隶变”“楷变”所变乱了。
    （第三）有些反映奴隶社会、封建社会的字，在现代为严重背时的字，要择要改作。最严重的是把许多坏人坏事都从女，如“奸佞嫉妒”等等是绝对不能容忍的。
    汉字必须全面根本改造，也可能全面根本改造。照估计，把单体字精简笔画，把复体字缩减级次，清除不必要的成分之后，总起来可以简到一半以下，或是简得更多。旧有的常用字每字平均约十一画，三批简化字发布之后，才降低了一些。将来彻底简化之后，估计平均可在六画以下，最多笔画数可在十画以内。这样，学习和使用的负担都减轻一半。
    再加上科学整理，每一个复体字都是分合鲜明；教学时有“先简后繁、先分后合”循序渐进的步骤，那就认识更容易，记忆更巩固了。
    汉字要经过根本改造之后，才能够和拼音字长期共存。两条腿走路，土洋并举。拼音字以听觉为主，视觉为辅；简单容易，便于机械化，最适于国际通行。汉字以视觉为主，听觉为辅；和汉语有共同发展的悠久历史，富于美艺，特别能充分担当继承传统文化遗产的任务。
    以上两个问题，是密切相关联的。但是，汉字的根本改造，从思想酝酿到具体成功，要相当的时间。扫盲工作，在目前先把“由简而繁、由分而合”循序渐进这一原则，就现状可能范围内，灵活地运用起来，是有好处的。
    以上的意见，都是不成熟的。请各位指教！
    关于西藏方面：我完全拥护党的方针政策和国务院的一切措施。我向西藏军区和在西藏的解放军同志们致敬。我为西藏自治区筹备委员会和西藏全体同胞预祝民主改革胜利成功和社会主义建设早日实现。我奉劝印度的善良朋友们坚持奉行潘查希拉——和平共处五项原则，不要干涉我们的内政，并且照顾达赖喇嘛早日安全回到我国。我正告帝国主义分子和扩张主义分子们：你们所做所说，都是罪恶、都是冒失的；你们还是趁早来一个脱身政策了事吧！我警告叛乱分子和一切反动派，你们不要一直走死路，你们赶紧回头吧！（附图表）
