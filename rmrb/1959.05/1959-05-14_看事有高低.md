Seeing Things at Different Levels
Zhuang Nong

Dear reader, have you read the communication "New Things in Manghe" in the May 12th People's Daily? There is a vivid record in it that is very enlightening.

In the Manghe Steel Plant, there is a No. 1 furnace foreman named Guo Fayan. In February, he proposed at a conference that their large furnace should produce 10,000 catties of iron per day. Some people didn't believe it, saying that 6,000 to 7,000 catties a day was already a lot, what was his basis for wanting to produce 10,000 catties a day? Guo Fayan smiled and said the basis: "In the past, the ore grade was not high, it was not roasted, and the particle size of the crushing was not uniform enough. If these weak links are overcome, there will be no problem in producing 10,000 catties a day." After he reminded everyone, they started working like this. As a result, the iron tapping time was shortened from 40 minutes per furnace to 20 minutes. A total of 10,552 catties of iron were produced in 24 hours.

The day they produced 10,000 catties of iron was very lively. Workers from other workshops came to visit as if they were watching a "foreign show". One of them was Zhou Beiyu, the foreman of the No. 6 furnace in the Dayu workshop. He was originally skeptical of these new methods, but after seeing it, he calculated in his mind, turned around and left. He immediately mobilized the masses to march towards a production of 10,000 catties, resulting in a daily output of 11,165 catties.

Comrade, now that you know this story, you must have valuable opinions to express; but wait, let me first say a few shallow opinions.

I think that although everyone (I only mean those within our people) is born with a pair of eyes, there are several different levels in how they see problems:

Like Guo Fayan, being able to see problems in daily production, find the key, and propose solutions, thus being able to "first sound the horn to march towards high yield," is a first-class way of seeing things. Originally, the problems he pointed out should have existed on the same furnace, and there were many people on each furnace, but others did not discover these problems first, but only "after he reminded them," they all suddenly realized. This is precisely because everyone's eyes are the same, but there are different levels in seeing things.

Like Zhou Beiyu, the foreman of the No. 6 furnace, although he did not discover the problem first, and was initially skeptical of Guo Fayan's proposal, so it cannot be counted as a first-class way of seeing things; however, look at him during the visit: he looks with his eyes, calculates in his mind, understands immediately, goes back immediately, quickly catches up, and "as a result, the daily output reached 11,165 catties," which is more than 500 catties more than Guo Fayan and the others. This is what is called "an expert sees the trick," and changes immediately upon understanding. Foreman Zhou is worthy of being a person with heart, which can be regarded as a second-class way of seeing things.

There is also a type of person who is also enthusiastic about new things, happy to hear and see that others have made new discoveries, and they also go to visit and applaud, but they are careless, and after reading, they gain little, and even the impression left is not deep. Therefore, they neither discovered the problem before others like Guo Fayan, nor did they understand it after seeing it like Zhou Beiyu. Compared with people like Zhou Beiyu, this kind of person suffers from not using their heart enough. Facing the dazzling new things, they end up only watching the "excitement" and did not find the "trick". Therefore, from the aspect of "seeing," they can only be listed as third-class.

The above three types of people are all enthusiastic. However, the size of their efforts is different. We often encounter such phenomena: a person with heart can gain inspiration even from watching a variety show; while a person without heart, even if he goes to see a technical demonstration, ends up just watching it as a play. There is an ancient saying: "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who put their heart into it." This shows that the level of seeing and the depth of what is gained are indeed greatly related to the size of the viewer's efforts!

Dear reader with heart, maybe you can find something useful for yourself from these different levels of seeing things!

    看事有高低
    庄农
    亲爱的读者，你读过5月12日人民日报上的通讯“漭河新事”吗？那里面有一段生动的记载，对人很有启发。
    漭河钢铁厂里，有个一号炉炉长叫郭法彦，2月间，他在一个大会上提出要使他们的大炉子日产一万斤铁，有人不相信，说一炉日产六、七千斤就不少了，现在你要日产一万斤有什么根据？郭法彦笑着说出了根据：“过去矿石品位不高，没有焙烧，粉碎粒度又不够均匀。如果把这些薄弱的环节克服了，日产万斤一定没问题。”经他这么一提醒，大家就这样作起来。结果，出铁时间从每炉四十分钟，缩短到了二十分钟。二十四个小时炼出的铁，总共有一万零五百五十二斤。
    出万斤铁的这天，好不热闹。别的车间的工人们，都像看“西洋景”一样前来参观。其中有一个是大峪车间六号炉炉长周备玉，他原先是怀疑这些新办法的，等到看后，心里一计算，扭头就走。回去马上发动群众向万斤产量进军，结果达到日产一万一千一百六十五斤。
    同志，你知道了这段故事，一定会有宝贵意见要发表；不过且慢，还是先让我说一说浅见吧。
    我觉得，虽然人人（我只是指我们人民内部）都生有一双眼，但看起问题来，却又有几等不同：
    像郭法彦那样，能在日常生产中看出问题，找出关键，提出办法，因而能够“首先吹起了向高产进军的号角”，这是头等看法。本来，在同样的炉子上，像他指出的问题，应该都是存在的，每个炉子上又各有许多人，但别人没有首先发现这些问题，只是“经他这么一提醒”，才都恍然大悟。这正是人眼都一样，看事有高低。
    像六号炉炉长周备玉那样，虽然没有首先发现问题，而且，起初还对郭法彦的提议有怀疑，所以，算不得头等看法了；但是，你看他参观的时候：眼里看，心里算，一点就透，立即回去，快马加鞭，急起直追，“结果达到日产一万一千一百六十五斤”，比郭法彦他们还多产了五百多斤。这正是所谓“行家看门道”，一通即变，周炉长不愧为有心人，这可算作二等看法。
    还有一种人，他们对新事物也还热心，听到和看到别人有了新发现也高兴，他们同样也去参观，也鼓掌，但是，他们粗枝大叶，看完之后，所得无多，甚至留下的印象也不深。因此，他们既没有像郭法彦那样发现问题于别人之先，也没有像周备玉这样悟透于一看之后。这种人比起周备玉那样的人来，吃亏在用心不够。面对着眼花缭乱的新事物，结果只落得看了“热闹”，并没有寻到“门道”。所以，从“看”的方面来说，只能列为三等。
    以上三种人都是热心人。但是用心大小各有不同。我们常常碰到这样的现象：一个有心人，即使在看杂技表演，他也能从中获得启发；而一个无心的人，即使去看技术表演，结果也只是当戏看。有句古语：“天下无难事，只怕有心人”。这说明看法的高低和所得的深浅，实在是同看者用心的大小有很大的关系啊！
    有心的读者，你也许能从几等不同的看法中，找到一点对自己有用的东西吧！
