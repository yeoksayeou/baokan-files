Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 24th: Laboring people in various parts of North Korea have been holding rallies in recent days to condemn the Syngman Rhee clique's "immigration" plot to sell South Korean people to foreign countries as slaves, and to support the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the 22nd regarding this matter.

　　Li Yongshan, a lathe operator at the Qingjin Railway Factory, demanded that the Syngman Rhee clique immediately cease its "immigration" plot when speaking at a rally held at the factory on the 23rd. He said that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, poverty and unemployment have been permanently eliminated in North Korea, and all working people are living happy lives. We demand that the South Korean authorities immediately send the South Korean brothers who are to be sold to foreign countries to the embrace of the Republic of the North.

　　Zheng Xiyong, a worker at the Pyongyang Electrical Machinery Plant, said at a rally held at the plant that we have made all preparations to accept South Korean unemployed, starving farmers, and orphans, so that they can come and live a happy life with us. We will never allow the U.S.-Rhee clique to sell our compatriots to foreign countries.

　　Residents of Dongyan-ri, Hamju County, South Hamgyong Province, also held a residents' meeting on the 23rd. Agricultural cooperative member Li Guishi said at the meeting that if the U.S.-Rhee clique disregards the wishes of the North Korean people to save their South Korean compatriots and continues to pursue their evil plot, they will be strongly condemned by the entire Korean people and world opinion.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd: Our correspondent reports: Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Syngman Rhee clique is stepping up its plot to sell South Korean people as slaves to Latin American countries.

　　On May 11th, the Syngman Rhee clique announced the so-called "Overseas Immigration Committee Order" and formed an "Overseas Immigration Committee" headed by the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" to carry out the heinous plan of large-scale human trafficking to foreign countries. Several months ago, Syngman Rhee's ambassador to the United States went to some Latin American countries to engage in slave trading. News has it that Brazil, Paraguay and other countries have recently formally notified the South Korean authorities, expressing their willingness to receive South Korean "immigrants." Thus, the large-scale "immigration" plot that the Syngman Rhee clique began planning in January of this year is about to be implemented. Hundreds of thousands of South Korean unemployed, veterans, and North Korean residents who were kidnapped to South Korea, after being drained of their blood and sweat by the Syngman Rhee clique, are now facing the fate of being trafficked to foreign countries like African Americans in the United States.

　　In order to conceal the evil consequences of their criminal rule in South Korea and to create a basis for their human trafficking plot, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are spreading the fallacy of South Korea's "overpopulation" and claiming that their "immigration" plot is a "solution to unemployment."

　　In fact, the population growth rate in South Korea is gradually declining. According to South Korea's "Dong-A Ilbo," the population growth rate in South Korea in 1958 was only 16 per thousand. As is well known, the extreme poverty of the South Korean people is due to the U.S. occupation of South Korea and the criminal rule of the Syngman Rhee clique. In the fourteen years of their rule in South Korea, the U.S.-Rhee clique has reduced South Korea's industrial production by half and its grain output by one-third. This has created the tragic situation of six million six hundred thousand unemployed and millions of farmers without food every year.

　　The Syngman Rhee clique's "immigration" plot to sell South Korean people to foreign countries as lifelong slaves has aroused immense anger among the Korean people.

　　After the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on January 22nd of this year condemning the Syngman Rhee clique's "immigration" plot, it issued another statement on May 22nd, demanding that the Syngman Rhee clique immediately cease this plot and send the South Koreans who are to be sold to foreign countries to North Korea.

　　The Republic's government's statement demonstrates the fraternal affection of all the people in North Korea for the South Korean people. If the Syngman Rhee clique rejects the Republic's government's demands and suggestions and continues to pursue its "immigration" plot, it will further expose its traitorous stance and will be condemned by all the good people of the world.

### 朝鲜各地人民集会支持政府声明  不许李承晚集团贩卖南部同胞  在美李阴谋下千万南朝鲜居民面临奴隶命运

    朝鲜各地人民集会支持政府声明
    不许李承晚集团贩卖南部同胞
    在美李阴谋下千万南朝鲜居民面临奴隶命运
    新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜北部各地劳动人民连日纷纷举行集会，谴责李承晚集团要把南朝鲜人民卖给外国当奴隶的“移民”阴谋，并且支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在22日就此发表的声明。
    清津铁路工厂镟工李用善在23日这个厂举行的集会上发言时要求李承晚集团立即停止“移民”阴谋。他说，在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，朝鲜北部已经永远消灭了贫困和失业，所有的劳动人民都过着幸福的生活。我们要求南朝鲜当局立即把要卖往外国的南朝鲜兄弟送到共和国北部的怀抱中来。
    平壤电机厂的工人郑锡永在这个厂举行的集会上说，我们已经作好了接受南朝鲜失业者、饥饿农民和孤儿的一切准备，让他们来同我们一起过幸福生活，我们决不容许美李集团把我们的同胞卖给外国。
    咸镜南道咸州郡东岩里的居民也在23日举行居民大会。农业社社员李桂石在会上说，如果美李集团无视朝鲜北部人民拯救南朝鲜同胞的愿望，继续推行它们的罪恶阴谋的话，它们将受到全体朝鲜人民和全世界舆论的强烈谴责。
    新华社平壤23日电　本社记者报道：李承晚集团在美帝国主义的策动下，正在加紧推行把南朝鲜人民当做奴隶卖给拉丁美洲国家的阴谋。
    5月11日，李承晚集团公布了所谓“海外移民委员会令”，组成了以“外务部长官”为委员长的“海外移民委员会”，来执行大规模向外国贩卖人口的罪恶计划。几个月以前，李承晚的驻美大使曾经到一些拉丁美洲国家去进行贩卖奴隶的勾当。有消息说，最近巴西、巴拉圭等国已经正式通知南朝鲜当局，表示准备接收南朝鲜的“移民”。这样，李承晚集团从今年1月就开始策划的大规模“移民”阴谋即将付诸实施。成千上万的南朝鲜失业者、退伍军人、被劫往南朝鲜的朝鲜北部居民，在被李承晚集团榨干了血汗以后，正面临着被贩往美国的黑人的命运。
    美国和李承晚集团为了掩饰它们在南朝鲜的罪恶统治的恶果，为它们的贩卖人口的阴谋制造根据，正在散布所谓南朝鲜“人口过剩”的滥调，并且把它们的“移民”阴谋说成是“救济失业的办法”。
    实际上，南朝鲜的人口增殖率正在逐渐下降。据南朝鲜“东亚日报”说，1958年南朝鲜的人口增殖率只有千分之十六。如所周知，目前南朝鲜人民生活极度贫困的原因，正是美国对南朝鲜的占领和李承晚集团的罪恶统治。美李集团在统治南朝鲜的十四年来，使南朝鲜的工业生产减少了一半，粮食产量减少了三分之一。这才造成了失业人口达六百六十万、断粮农民年年有数百万的悲惨局面。
    李承晚集团要把南朝鲜人民卖往异国去做终身奴隶的“移民”阴谋已经引起了朝鲜人民的无比愤怒。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在今年1月22日发表声明谴责了李承晚集团的“移民”阴谋以后，在5月22日再次发表声明，要求李承晚集团立即停止这一阴谋，并且把将被卖往外国的南朝鲜人送到朝鲜北部。
    共和国政府的声明显示了朝鲜北部全体人民对南朝鲜人民的手足之情。如果李承晚集团拒绝共和国政府的要求和建议，继续推行它的“移民”阴谋，就将进一步暴露它的卖国立场，并将受到全世界善良人民的谴责。
