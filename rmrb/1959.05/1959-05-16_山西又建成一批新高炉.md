Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanxi Province has recently put another batch of newly built blast furnaces into production. At present, more than 200 large, medium, and small blast furnaces are being constructed successively throughout the province.

Shanxi Province's pig iron production task this year is nearly double that of last year. Among this, half of the task will be accomplished by existing equipment, and the other half will be undertaken by newly added blast furnace equipment. In response to this situation, in addition to taking measures to tap the potential of existing equipment, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting at the beginning of this year to deploy the construction of new blast furnaces.

    山西又建成一批新高炉
    据新华社讯　山西省最近又有一批新建高炉投入生产。目前，全省还有二百多座大、中、小型高炉陆续开工兴建。
    山西省今年的生铁生产任务比去年增加近一倍，其中，一半任务靠现有设备生产，另一半任务需要新增加的高炉设备担负。针对这一情况，中共山西省委除了采取措施发挥原有设备的潜力以外，在今年年初就召开会议部署了新高炉的建设工作。
