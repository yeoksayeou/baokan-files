    Old Experiences Play a New Role
    Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant "Turns Over Boxes and Cabinets" to Promote Effective Advanced Experiences
    (Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, 4th) In the process of carrying out a mass technical revolution and technical innovation movement, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant mobilized the masses to summarize, discuss, and appraise some advanced experiences that had been effective in the past but were interrupted midway, and applied them to current production. This approach has powerfully promoted production.
    From 1950 to 1958, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant successively promoted nearly a hundred advanced experiences in technical design, technology, cutting tools, tools, operation methods, and economic management from both domestic and foreign sources. These advanced experiences played a significant role in ensuring the completion of production plans for each period and improving technical levels and enterprise management. However, in the past, the promotion of advanced experiences mostly took the form of campaigns, rising and falling intermittently, and could not be fully incorporated into process regulations or sustained, resulting in many advanced experiences "blossoming in our plant but bearing fruit in other plants." Especially since the second half of last year, leaders and engineering technicians have been busy with current production, relaxing their leadership and guidance in promoting advanced experiences, resulting in no one organizing or inspecting. Workers also rarely studied how to apply advanced experiences. Therefore, by the beginning of this year, fewer than ten of the advanced experiences promoted in the past were truly widely grasped by the masses and applied to production. Most of the cadres responsible for promoting advanced experiences had taken on other jobs.
    In March of this year, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant launched a vigorous double-output innovation competition. Technical innovations sprung up like mushrooms after rain, production doubled repeatedly, and groups of advanced producers emerged one after another. Some workers created outstanding achievements by using advanced experiences that had been used in the past. Chen Yunfu and Shi Youqing, lathe operators in the machining workshop, used the previous rapid thread-chasing operation method when chasing screw threads. In one shift, Shi Youqing reached 510 pieces, and Chen Yunfu reached 520 pieces, both setting the highest records in the plant. The mud-type casting, a traditional Chinese casting technology promoted in the casting workshop, greatly improved production efficiency. The plant's Party committee studied this situation, seized on this trend, and immediately called on all workers in the plant to "bring out all their skills" and "turn over boxes and cabinets" of advanced experiences to apply them to current production. At the beginning of April, in arranging the work for the second quarter and April, the Party committee regarded the promotion of advanced experiences of decisive significance (including new and old ones) as one of the main contents and measures for launching the technical revolution, technical innovation, and completing key products. Based on the Party committee's instructions and the plant's actual situation, the plant department, after appraisal and selection, proposed a draft plan for promoting thirty-six important advanced experiences, such as quick-drying molding sand, mud-type casting, pressure magnesium addition, and electrolytic slag desulfurization, and submitted this draft plan to the workers for discussion. After discussion and supplementation, a specific plan will be made and resolutely implemented. In the discussion, casting workers proposed that this year's promotion of mud-type casting should reach 60%-80% on batches of products, and the promotion of quick-drying molding sand should reach over 80% if materials permit. Forging and riveting workshop steam hammer workers proposed to further promote advanced experiences such as rapid forging and die forging. Within two days, April 10th and 11th, the unit hourly output of a three-ton steam casting had reached 560 kilograms. Workers in other workshops are also studying the content and measures for promoting advanced experiences based on product objects.
    After discussion, appraisal, and supplementation by the masses, some old advanced experiences have undergone new developments. Lathe operator Su Tianhe improved the tool post based on everyone's opinions, changing the original "rapid thread-chasing method" from one tool to two tools simultaneously, creating a record of chasing six hundred screws in one shift. The Yuan'en forging team changed the "steam hammer double-sided operation method" to the "three-sided operation method," increasing production efficiency by three to four times compared to the double-sided operation method. The casting workshop workers successfully tested the use of mud-type steel casting on March 19th, increasing production efficiency by eight times and reducing costs by 80%. (Li Benmo)

    老经验发挥新作用
    太原矿山机器厂“翻箱倒柜”推广行之有效的先进经验
    本报太原4日电　太原矿山机器厂在开展群众性技术革命和技术革新运动中，发动群众总结、讨论和鉴定一些过去曾经用之有效、但中途间断的先进经验，用之于当前生产。这种作法对生产起了有力的推动作用。
    太原矿山机器厂从1950年到1958年，先后推广了国内外的技术设计、工艺、刃具、工具、操作方法，以及经济管理等方面的先进经验近百项。这些先进经验对保证完成各个时期的生产计划和提高技术水平，改进企业管理起了重大作用。但是以往推广先进经验大都采取运动的方式，时起时伏，不能完全纳入工艺规程，坚持下去，形成很多先进经验在“本厂开花，外厂结果”。特别是去年下半年以来，领导和工程技术人员忙于当前生产，放松了对推广先进经验的领导和指导，形成无人组织，无人检查。工人也很少研究如何运用先进经验。因此，到今年年初，以往推行过的先进经验，真正比较普遍被群众掌握，并用之于生产的，剩有不到十种。负责推广先进经验的干部大都做了别的工作。
    今年3月份，太原矿山机器厂掀起了轰轰烈烈的翻番革新竞赛运动。技术革新如雨后春笋般出现，生产一再翻番，先进生产者一群又一群地出现。其中有的工人就是用了以往用过的先进经验创造了出色的成绩。加工车间车工陈云福、史有庆，在挑螺丝扣时，用以往的快速挑扣操作方法，在一个班内，史有庆达到了五百一十件，陈云福达到了五百二十件，都创造了全厂最高纪录。熔铸车间推广的我国传统铸造技术——坭型铸造，大大提高了生产效率。厂党委研究了这个情况，抓住了这个苗头，立即号召全厂工人“把十八般武艺都拿出来”，把先进经验来个“翻箱倒柜”，用之于当前生产。4月初，党委在安排二季度和4月份的工作中，就把推广具有决定意义的先进经验（有新的、有旧的）作为展开技术革命、技术革新和完成重点产品的主要内容和措施之一。厂部根据党委的指示，并根据厂的实际情况，经过鉴定选择，提出了推广快干型砂、坭型铸造、压力加镁、电解溶渣去硫等三十六项重要先进经验的草案，并把这一草案交给工人进行讨论；经过讨论补充之后，将再作出具体计划，坚决贯彻执行。在讨论中，熔铸工人提出，今年推广坭型铸造在成批的产品上要达到60％—80％，快干型砂在材料许可的情况下，推广到80％以上。锻铆车间汽锤工人提出，要进一步推广快速锻造、胎模锻等先进经验。在4月10日和11日两天内，三吨汽铸的单位台时产量已达到五百六十公斤。其他各车间工人，也都在根据产品对象，研究推广先进经验的内容和措施。
    一些旧有的先进经验经过群众的讨论、鉴定和补充后，有了新的发展，车工宿天和根据大家的意见，改进了车刀架，将原有的“快速挑扣法”由一个刀改成两个刀同时挑，创造了一个班挑六百个螺丝的最高纪录。原恩和锻工小组把“汽锤双边作业法”改为“三边作业法”，生产效率比用双边作业法提高三、四倍。熔铸车间工人在3月19日试验用坭型铸钢成功，生产效率提高八倍，成本降低80％。（李本末）
