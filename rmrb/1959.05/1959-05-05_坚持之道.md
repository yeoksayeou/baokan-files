The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant mobilized the masses to "rummage through boxes and cabinets," and reintroduced and promoted advanced experiences that had been effective in the past but were interrupted midway. This approach is very interesting.

In recent years, in the vigorous mass movements, and with the help of the Soviet Union and many other brotherly countries, the "treasury" of advanced experiences in industrial enterprises has contained countless "gems"! Almost every industry can cite several or dozens of the most important advanced technologies and experiences. The management experience, leadership experience, and experiences applicable to a factory, a workshop, a work section, or a type of work, which are of more universal significance, are even countless. Have all these experiences been promoted? Have they all been maintained? After checking, many enterprises will probably be surprised: "Ah, so much potential has been forgotten!"

The practice of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant reminds us that we should also "walk on two legs" when it comes to technological innovation and revolution, creating new things on the one hand and promoting old things on the other. In fact, for those places where it has not been promoted or has not been adhered to, how can the so-called old advanced experience be old? Didn't the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant bring a new look to production after organizing the masses to appraise, supplement, and use old experiences? Moreover, these "old" experiences have been tested by practice and are trusted and familiar to the masses, making them easier to "restore." Further innovation on such an "old" foundation will undoubtedly be much more effective and faster than starting completely from scratch.

There is another point in the news from the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant that is also worth considering. Why did many advanced experiences in this factory stop midway and could not be maintained? According to their inspection, the basic reason is that they were not combined with the improvement of enterprise management, and the advanced experiences were not incorporated into the process regulations and various management systems, and there was no one specifically responsible for promoting the work of advanced experience. This lesson is very important. People often say that vigorously carrying out mass movements must be combined with improving enterprise management. The necessity of this combination has been proved once again by the promotion of advanced experience in the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant.

We recommend the experience of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant and put forward two wishes:

First, we hope that all enterprises will try "rummaging through boxes and cabinets" to let all the old treasures shine with new brilliance;

Second, we hope that while vigorously carrying out mass movements, we will also seize the opportunity to improve enterprise management, and consolidate every gain of the mass movement with management work and new and good rules and regulations.

    坚持之道
    孔桑
    太原矿山机器厂发动群众“翻箱倒柜”，把过去曾经行之有效但中途间断的先进经验，重新拿出来推广使用。这种做法很有意思。
    这几年来，在蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动中，在苏联等许多兄弟国家的帮助下，工业企业的先进经验“宝库”里，所藏的“瑰宝”何止千千万万！几乎每个行业都可以举出几项、几十项最重要的先进技术经验来。那些具有更普遍意义的管理经验、领导经验，以及适用于一个工厂、一个车间、一个工段、一个工种的经验，更无从计数。这些经验都推广了吗？都坚持下来了吗？检查一下，恐怕不少企业都会惊奇：“啊，竟还有这样多的潜力被忘掉了！”
    太原矿山机器厂的做法提示我们：对待技术革新和技术革命，也应当“两条腿走路”，一方面创造新的，一方面推广旧的。其实，对那些并未推广或没有坚持的地方说来，所谓旧的先进经验何尝是旧的呢？太原矿山机器厂不就是组织群众鉴定、补充、使用了旧经验之后，给生产带来了新的面貌吗？而且，这些“旧”经验经过实践的考验，是群众所信服、所熟悉的东西，“恢复”起来比较容易。在这样的“旧”基础上再进一步革新，无疑一定比完全从新的搞起，效果要大得多、快得多。
    太原矿山机器厂的消息里，还有一点也很值得思考。为什么这个厂有不少先进经验中途间断，不能坚持呢？根据他们的检查，基本原因是没有同改进企业管理结合起来，没有把先进经验订到工艺规程和各种管理制度当中去，没有专人负责推广先进经验的工作。这个教训很重要。人们常说，大搞群众运动必须同改善企业管理结合起来。这种结合的必要性，从太原矿山机器厂推广先进经验这件事上再一次得到了证明。
    我们推荐太原矿山机器厂的经验，并提出两点愿望：
    一愿各个企业都来试试“翻箱倒柜”，让一切旧宝贝放出新的光辉；
    二愿大家在大搞群众运动当中，也抓紧改进企业管理，把群众运动的每一点收获，都用管理工作和新的好的规章制度巩固起来。
