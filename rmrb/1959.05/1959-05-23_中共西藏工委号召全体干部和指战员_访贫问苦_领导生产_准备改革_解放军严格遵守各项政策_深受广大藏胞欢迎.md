Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 22nd: The CCP Tibet Work Committee recently issued instructions to Party committees at all levels throughout the region, calling on all cadres and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to not only be combat teams to quell the rebellion, but also work teams to deeply mobilize the masses and lead mass production, to prepare for democratic reform in Tibet. Currently, Party committees and military control commissions at all levels in Tibet have formed work teams to go deep into the countryside, visit the poor and ask about their hardships, help the masses with production, and carry out mass work.

The CCP Tibet Work Committee pointed out in its instructions that while thoroughly suppressing the rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group, it is necessary to actively lead mass production and conscientiously implement the policy of "whoever cultivates the land owns the harvest and pays no rent" for the land of rebels this year, to prevent land from being abandoned and strive for a bumper harvest in the first year after the suppression of the rebellion. Because Tibet has long been under the rule of a dark, backward, cruel, and reactionary serf system, grain yields are very low and there is a lot of wasteland. The CCP Tibet Work Committee required Party committees at all levels to lead the masses to increase yields per unit area and call on the masses to reclaim wasteland for production and expand the area of cultivated land in the coming years. At present, Party committees at all levels should focus on the following main aspects of production: building small-scale water conservancy projects, digging canals for irrigation; protecting livestock and prohibiting the indiscriminate slaughter of draught cattle; improving the existing farm tools of Tibetans, etc. At the same time, the masses are called upon to change their habits of not accumulating manure, not applying fertilizer, not cultivating, and not weeding, and to strive to accumulate and apply fertilizer and improve field management.

The CCP Tibet Work Committee believes that it is necessary to meet the urgent demands of the broad masses of the Tibetan people for democratic reform, actively lead and organize the masses to prepare for the implementation of democratic reform, thoroughly overthrow the cruel serf system, and gradually lead the Tibetan people onto the path of democracy and socialism. To this end, the CCP Tibet Work Committee requires cadres at all levels to actively visit the poor and ask about their hardships, earnestly go deep among the poor working masses, eat, live, and work with the masses, and firmly establish the revolutionary style of closely contacting the masses and working hard for the liberation of the million serfs in Tibet.

Zhang Guohua and Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretaries of the CCP Tibet Work Committee, recently led responsible cadres from some departments of the Work Committee and the Military Region to visit the living conditions of Chaba (those who pay corvee labor, pay rent and tribute to the serf owners, and obtain a piece of land to cultivate, a kind of fixed serf registered in the household register), Duiquiong (meaning small households, most of whom are refugees from bankrupt Chaba, re-attached to new lords or large Chaba, renting small pieces of land by renting or performing corvee labor, some of whom are employed as laborers), and Langsheng (house slaves who serve the serf owners for life) in Caizong and Donggazong near Lhasa. Zhang Guohua also participated in the labor of repairing water canals with poor farmers. Work teams from Party committees and military control commissions at all levels also went deep into the countryside. Work team members talked with the masses in dilapidated huts and tents, helped the masses labor in the fields, and widely publicized the Party's policies. The Nagdong County People's Government in Shannan, which was established after the suppression of the rebellion, issued agricultural loans and led the masses to spring plowing and sowing. Deputy County Chief Zashi Jianzan went to Duopozhang to inspect the spring sowing and visit the poor and ask about their hardships. The masses said with emotion: In the past, we only saw landlords and Zongben (county heads) exploiting and oppressing us, and today is the first time we have seen a county head caring about our production like this. The staff of the Najin Hydropower Station Construction Headquarters of the Tibet Military Region, carrying water pumps and tractors, helped poor farmers irrigate and sow day and night. Fu Tingxiu, the commander of the construction headquarters, and Hong Liu, the deputy director of the political department of the military region, both watered the fields with the masses. The old farmers in this village brought boiled water to the soldiers and insisted that the soldiers drink it. Some asked the soldiers to come to their homes for a reunion meal. They said: The Kashag that was riding on our heads has been overthrown, and happy days have arrived!

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 22nd: Our agency's accompanying military reporter Jing Jiadong reported: The People's Liberation Army's exemplary observance of various policies and its actions of cherishing the people have been praised and extolled by the broad masses of Tibetan compatriots.

During the advance to wipe out scattered bandits in the remote areas of Shannan, a unit of the People's Liberation Army, in order not to disturb the Tibetan people, often camped in the open, did not live in civilian houses, and collected grass and cow dung for fuel by themselves, and did not buy firewood from the masses. A certain artillery unit rushed to Longxue Xika late at night to pursue and suppress the remaining bandits. The local people had fled into the mountains to avoid the bandits. The officers and soldiers spent the night in a civilian house. The next day, before leaving, they found that they had accidentally broken an egg belonging to the landlord. They decided to leave compensation money and wrote a letter to apologize to the landlord. The letter said: "Dear Landlord, we are very sorry for breaking one of your eggs. We are leaving compensation money, please accept it." The troops advanced, but this story was spread among the local Tibetans like a myth.

In the Shannan area, where the rebels were entrenched, the rebels had almost robbed many families of their belongings and livestock. After seeing this situation, the rebellion-quelling troops provided timely relief. A certain unit captured a large number of cattle, sheep, and horses from the rebels near Cuona Zong. Hearing that these livestock had been snatched from the people by the rebels, they immediately notified the masses to come and claim them. When the Tibetan compatriots got their livestock back, they often held the hands of the People's Liberation Army and were so grateful that they could not speak.

The rebellion-quelling troops also carried out the tasks of work teams. Wherever they went, they actively led and helped the masses carry out spring plowing and production, provided seed loans to poor farmers, helped the masses transport manure and repair ditches, dispatched military horses to plow the land for the masses, and medical personnel treated the people day and night. The troops stationed in Zedang, Naidong, and other places had treated more than 3,000 people and helped the masses with spring plowing and production for more than 2,300 workdays.

The Tibetan people warmly celebrated their new life and sang praises of the People's Liberation Army with unrestrained joy. While milking cows, they sang: "One day has passed, and another day has come, but only today has the sun appeared; the Tibetan army's Ula Zhi passed by, and the 'Defenders of the Faith' came to rob again, only the People's Liberation Army is the benefactor of the Tibetan compatriots!"

    中共西藏工委号召全体干部和指战员
    访贫问苦  领导生产  准备改革
    解放军严格遵守各项政策  深受广大藏胞欢迎
    新华社拉萨22日电　中共西藏工委最近向全区各级党委发出指示，号召全体干部和人民解放军驻藏部队的全体指挥员、战斗员，既要做平叛的战斗队，又要做深入发动群众、领导群众生产的工作队，为在西藏进行民主改革作好准备工作。现在，西藏全区的各级党委和军事管制委员会已经纷纷组成工作队深入农村，访贫问苦，帮助群众生产，开展群众工作。
    中共西藏工委在指示中指出，在彻底平定西藏上层反动集团发动的叛乱的同时，必须积极领导群众生产，认真贯彻今年对叛乱分子的土地实行谁种谁收、不缴地租的政策，不荒废土地，在平叛后的第一年争取农业丰收。由于西藏长期处在黑暗、落后、残酷、反动的农奴制度统治下，粮食产量很低，荒地很多。中共西藏工委在指示中要求各级党委今明年内一面要领导群众提高单位面积产量，一面要号召群众开荒生产，扩大耕地面积。当前各级党委在生产上应抓住以下主要环节：兴修小型水利，开渠灌溉；保护牲畜，不准乱杀耕牛；改进藏民现有农具等。同时号召群众改变不积肥、不施肥、不中耕、不锄草的习惯，努力积肥施肥，改进田间管理。
    中共西藏工委认为，必须满足西藏广大人民对民主改革的迫切要求，积极领导和组织群众准备实行民主改革，彻底推翻残酷的农奴制度，使西藏人民逐步走上民主和社会主义的道路。为此，中共西藏工委要求各级干部要积极地访贫问苦，认真深入到穷苦的劳动群众中去，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，坚定地树立起为解放西藏百万农奴而紧密联系群众、艰苦工作的革命作风。
    中共西藏工委副书记张国华、周仁山最近曾率领工委和军区一些部门的负责干部，分别到拉萨附近的蔡宗和东噶宗，访问了差巴（就是支差的人，他们向农奴主缴纳租贡和服徭役，取得一份差地耕种，是一种在户籍的固定农奴）、堆穷（即小户的意思，他们绝大多数是由差巴破产后逃亡出来的，重新依附新的领主或大差巴，用出租或出差役租种小块土地，有的是当雇工）、朗生（即家奴，终身为农奴主服劳役）的生活情况，张国华并和贫苦农民们一起参加了修水渠的劳动。各级党委和军管会的工作队也纷纷深入农村，工作队员们在破烂的矮屋里和帐篷里同群众谈心，在田野上帮助群众劳动，并广泛宣传党的政策。平叛后成立起来的山南乃东县人民政府，发放了农贷，并领导群众春耕、播下了种子。副县长扎希坚赞又到多颇章地方检查春播情况，访贫问苦。群众感动地说：过去只见地主、宗本（县长）剥削压榨我们，今天才第一次看到县长这样关心我们生产。西藏军区纳金水电站修建指挥部的工作人员，带着抽水机、拖拉机，不分日夜帮助贫苦农民灌溉、播种。修建指挥部指挥员扶廷修大校和军区政治部副主任洪流大校都和群众一起进行浇水。这个村的老农民给战士们送来开水，一定要战士们喝下。有的要求战士到他们家里吃顿团圆饭。他们说：骑在头上的噶厦被打倒了，幸福的日子来到了！
    新华社拉萨22日电　本社随军记者景家栋报道：人民解放军平叛大军模范地遵守各项政策和爱民的行为，受到广大藏胞的赞扬和歌颂。
    在扫荡山南边远地区散匪的进军中，解放军某部为了不打扰藏族人民，经常露宿野外，不住民房，并且自己打草和拾牛粪作燃料，不向群众买柴草。某炮兵部队为追剿残匪深夜赶到陇学溪卡，当地群众为躲避叛匪，都跑到山里去了，官兵们便在一处民房过夜，第二天临行时，他们发现由于不慎打破了房东一个鸡蛋，决定留下赔偿钱，并且写了一封信向房主道歉，信中说：“亲爱的房东，很对不起，碰破了你的一个鸡蛋，现在留下赔偿钱，请你收下。”部队前进了，这个故事却像神话一样在当地藏胞中传颂着。
    在叛匪盘踞的山南地区，许多人家里的东西和牲畜差不多被叛匪抢光了。平叛部队看到这种情况后，及时地进行救济。某部在措那宗附近掳获了叛匪的大批牛、羊和马匹，听说这些牲畜是叛匪从老百姓手中抢来的，立即通知群众前来认领。当藏胞再次得到自己的牲畜时，他们往往拉着解放军的手感激得说不出话来。
    平叛大军还执行了工作队的任务，每到一地，就积极领导和帮助群众进行春耕生产，给贫苦农民贷放种子，帮助群众送粪修渠，抽出军用马匹给群众耕地，医务人员日夜为人民治病。进驻泽当、乃东等地的部队，曾经给群众治病三千多人次，帮助群众春耕生产共做了二千三百多个劳动日。
    藏族人民热烈欢庆自己的新生和纵情歌颂人民解放军。他们边挤着牛奶边歌唱道：“一天过去了，第二天又来了，只有今天才出现了太阳；藏军的乌拉支过了，‘卫教军’又来抢劫，只有解放军是藏胞的恩人！”（附图片）
