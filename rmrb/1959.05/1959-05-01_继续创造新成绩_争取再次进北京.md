Comrades of the presidium, fellow delegates:

I completely agree with and support the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports have deeply educated and greatly encouraged me. I will definitely carry out my work in accordance with the spirit of the reports and guarantee that my work will be even more outstanding.

This year, the task has doubled, and large transformers account for 70%. However, all employees of the factory have full confidence in completing this task.

In the past few years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Like our worker brothers and other working people across the country, the employees of our Shenyang Transformer Factory, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, have broken down superstitions, emancipated our minds, earnestly studied advanced Soviet experience, and vigorously carried out technical revolution and technical innovation with a daring, bold, and practical communist style. In 1958, the number of technical innovation projects increased by 22 times compared to 1957, with the highest efficiency improvement reaching 720 times. As a result, we have made significant achievements in production technology. The output of our main product, transformers, increased by 123% in 1958 compared to 1957, reaching and exceeding the design level two years ahead of schedule. We trial-produced 36 new products, an increase of eight times compared to 1957. Among these, 24 types were independently designed, such as 40,000 kVA 220 kV, 60,000 kVA 110 kV giant transformers, 1.8 million volt impulse voltage generators, 220 kV new current transformers, and small-volume switch cabinets. The Great Leap Forward in production technology last year has greatly advanced our factory on the road of independent design. This is a victory for the communist ideological emancipation movement, a victory for the Party's mass line, and a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism.

This year, our factory undertakes the glorious task of providing complete sets of equipment for six major areas directly related to ensuring the four major targets: steel rolling, mining, coal washing and coking, irrigation and drainage, rolling stock, and power stations. The state has assigned our factory the production task of transformers, our main product, which not only doubles the output compared to last year, but also sees large transformers accounting for more than 70% of the total output. Although we face certain difficulties in completing this leap forward plan, with the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the Party's general line illuminating our path forward, any difficulties will be overcome by us. When I was leaving, all the employees of the factory asked me to assure the Party and all the delegates: wherever the Party and Chairman Mao point, we will charge there. We will "jump and pick the fruit." On the basis of completing and overfulfilling the first quarter plan, we will continue to carry out the "Eight Comparisons and Three Highs" red flag competition, ensuring a full house in April, and successfully trial-produce a 75,000 kVA 66,000 volt giant transformer to present to the Party, Chairman Mao, and the conference as a gift.

In order to gradually transform the manual operations of the insulation workshop into machine operations, we have overcome numerous difficulties and carried out technological reforms.

In the past few years, under the Party's constant care and guidance, and with the enthusiastic help of comrades, I have continuously grown. I work in the insulation workshop, where there is relatively little production equipment and manual operations account for more than 70%. In order to gradually change manual operations to mechanical operations, improve labor productivity, and improve working conditions, I have worked with the workshop's employees to carry out technological reforms. Over the past seven years, with the Party's continuous training and everyone's direct help, I have completed 221 technical innovations (with one year of cultural studies in between), averaging one innovation every 12 days. In 1958, I helped other comrades implement 48 technical innovations. In the process of carrying out these technical innovations, although we encountered many difficulties, they were all overcome one by one under the correct leadership of the Party and with the help of comrades. For example, when we were manufacturing rolled cylinders, because the blanking process was done manually, we had to use 12 people working in three shifts every day, but we still couldn't keep up with the needs of the rolling machine. At the same time, because the material used was phenolic resin paper, when blanking, the dust flew everywhere and landed on the body, causing the skin to itch. This caused some comrades in the blanking group to develop skin diseases and be unable to work, thus becoming a key issue in the Great Leap Forward. I thought: the Party teaches us to do a good job in production and also to care for the masses. How can this make people feel at ease? So, I worked with my comrades day and night to study and finally came up with a plan: to create our own paper cutting and blanking machine. We reported this to the Party branch, which gave us great support and encouragement. So, we followed the plan and worked hard for ten days, finally creating a blanking machine. When we tested the machine, although it turned, it couldn't cut the paper. As soon as the paper entered the knife, it broke. Later, we continued to study and find problems, and found that the ratio between the main shaft wheel and the driven wheel was incorrect, so we carried out another modification. After the test, it still didn't work well. At this time, some people said some discouraging words, saying that we were so busy with tasks that we didn't have time to work on it, so we might as well just throw it aside. It would be better to add more people than to work on this machine. But the Party pointed out a very clear direction for us, that we must be clever on the basis of hard work. So, I continued to study with my comrades, not eating well or sleeping well, constantly thinking about it, even dreaming about it. Although we experienced more than ten failures, we finally successfully created this paper cutting and blanking machine, which not only saved seven laborers and ensured personal health, but also increased work efficiency by more than ten times. After this, under the specific leadership of the Party branch, we further organized a three-way combination team and established an amateur processing factory specifically to solve the weak links in the workshop's production. As a result, we successively created more than ten sets of indigenous equipment, such as automated trimming machines, wood flour tube processing circular saws, and large-scale folding machines, and completed more than 70 technical innovations in tools and processes, thereby turning most of the manual operations in the entire workshop into mechanized production. For example, the "circular saw" alone solved the manual operation of more than 20 kinds of wood flour pipes and insulating parts, turning them into mechanized production. After these technical revolutions and technical innovations, the production capacity of the entire workshop was tripled. Not only did the old workers engage in technical revolution, but the apprentices also engaged in improvements. For example, Ma Xiufen, a 17-year-old female apprentice who had just joined the factory, created a set of standard scribing templates, increasing efficiency by more than ten times. This year, the state's task for our factory is very arduous and also very glorious, accounting for a large proportion in our workshop. Although there are certain difficulties, I am determined to overcome them. I will definitely follow Premier Zhou's instructions in his report: "As long as we are prepared and strive to overcome them, then no difficulties can stop us from achieving victory."

Humbly learn and never be arrogant, strive to make more contributions

To this end, we must continue to work hard, overcome all difficulties in our progress, and work hard, practically, and cleverly. We must vigorously carry out technical revolution and technical innovation, and create another punching and shearing combined machine to replace five foreign sets of equipment in accordance with production needs, breaking through the bottleneck of insufficient equipment capacity. In addition, we must also successfully develop a corner ring winding machine and a curve shearing machine for high-voltage transformers, as well as automatic spacer block equipment and more than 40 other technical revolution and technical innovation projects. We must ensure that everyone is a versatile worker and is determined to turn the insulation workshop from a manual operation workshop into a mechanized production workshop before the "Eleventh" National Day, as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. After I did this work under the Party's education and care, the Party and the state gave me lofty honors. The working people of Shenyang City have elected me as a labor model for seven consecutive years. Last year, the leaders promoted me, an ordinary worker, to the position of engineer, and the Northeast Institute of Technology also hired me as a part-time professor. The Party and the state have given me such high honors, which makes me feel that my contributions are too small. The reason why I was able to become an engineer from an ordinary worker, and improve from someone who knew only a few hundred words to the cultural level of junior high school, is all the result of the Party's training and education for me. I sincerely thank the Party for its training and education. Under the Party's leadership and with everyone's help, although I have achieved some small results, it is still far from the Party's requirements for me. I must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one fall behind." I will always be a good servant of the people, humbly learn from others' advanced experience, strive to improve my political, cultural, and technical level, continue to muster soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, guarantee the outstanding completion of all the tasks the Party has given me, create new achievements, and strive to enter Beijing again in the fourth quarter of this year to report the good news to the Party and Chairman Mao.

    继续创造新成绩　争取再次进北京
    王凤恩代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长所作的几项报告，这些报告使我受到了深刻的教育和极大的鼓舞，我一定根据报告的精神去进行工作，并且保证工作作的更出色。
    今年任务增加一倍，大型变压器又占了百分之七十，但是全厂职工具有完成这一任务的充分信心
    过去几年来，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。我们沈阳变压器厂职工和全国工人弟兄及其他劳动人民一样，在过去的几年里，特别是一九五八年大跃进以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，破除迷信，解放思想，认真的学习苏联先进经验，以敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格大闹技术革命和技术革新，一九五八年技术革新项目比一九五七年增了二十二倍，其中提高效率最高的达七百二十倍。因而在生产技术上取得了巨大的成绩。主要产品变压器产量一九五八年比一九五七年增长百分之一百二十三，提前二年达到并超过了设计水平。新产品试制三十六种，比一九五七增长了八倍。其中自行设计的，像四万仟伏安二十二万伏，六万仟伏安一百一十万伏巨型变压器，一百八十万冲击电压发生器，二十二万伏新型电流互感器，小体积开关柜等达二十四种。去年生产技术上出现的大跃进，使我厂在自行设计的道路上大大地跨进了一步，这是共产主义思想解放运动的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利，也是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利。
    今年我们工厂承担着为保证四大指标直接有关的轧钢、采矿、洗煤炼焦、排灌、机车车辆、电站等六大设备配套的光荣任务。国家给我厂主要产品变压器的生产任务，不仅产量比去年翻了一番，而且大型变压器占总产量的百分之七十以上。我们完成这一跃进计划虽然有一定的困难，但是有党中央、毛主席的英明领导，有党的总路线照耀着我们前进的道路，任何困难都会被我们战胜的。我临来的时候，全厂职工要我向党和全体代表们保证：党和毛主席指向那里，我们就冲到那里。我们“要跳一跳把果子摘下来”。在完成和超额完成第一季度计划的基础上，继续开展“八比三高”红旗竞赛。保证四月满堂红。并试制成功七万五千仟伏安六万六千伏巨型变压器，向党向毛主席和大会献礼。
    为了把绝缘车间的手工操作逐步变为机器操作，克服重重困难，进行了技术改革
    几年来，在党时时刻刻关怀和教导下，在同志们热心帮助下，使我不断地成长起来。我是在绝缘车间工作，这个车间的生产设备比较少，手工操作占百分之七十以上。为了使手工操作逐渐的改变为机械操作，提高劳动生产率和改善劳动条件，我和车间的职工同志们共同努力，进行了技术改革。七年来在党不断的培养和大家的直接帮助下，使我完成了二百二十一项技术革新（中间学习文化一年）平均十二天完成一项。一九五八年帮助其他同志实现技术革新四十八项。在进行这些技术革新过程中，虽然遇到了许多困难，但是在党的正确领导和同志们的帮助下，都一一的被克服了。如我们在制造卷压筒时，由于下料工序是手工操作，每天不得不用十二个人三班倒，还是供不上卷压机的需要，同时由于使用的料是酚醛胶纸，在下料时粉沫飞扬落到身上而使皮肤发痒，这就使下料组有些同志得了皮肤病而不能工作，因而就成了大跃进中的关键，我想：党教育我们要搞好生产，又要关心群众，这件事怎能使人安心下去呢？于是便和同志们一道日夜的研究，最后终于研究出了一个方案，要自己创造一台裁纸下料机，汇报给党支部，支部给了我们很大的支持和鼓励，于是我们就按着计划苦战了十天，终于搞出了一台下料机，一试车，下料机虽然转动了，但是裁不了胶纸，胶纸一进刀就断头。后来又继续研究找毛病，发现主轴轮与被动轮比数不对，于是又进行了一次改装，经试车仍然不好用，这时有个别人就说些松劲的话，任务这么忙那有时间搞它，干脆扔一边去吧。任可再多加一些人，也不搞这个机器。但是党给我们指出了很明确的方向，要我们在苦干的基础上一定还得巧干。于是我又和同志们钻研下去，饭也吃不好，觉也睡不好，经常在琢磨它，作梦也在梦着它，虽然经过了十多次的失败，但最后终于将这台裁纸下料机创造成功了，不但节省了七个劳动力，保证了人身的健康，而且还提高了工作效率十倍以上。在这以后，我们在党支部的具体领导下，又进一步的组织了三结合大队，并建立了业余的加工工厂，专门来解决车间在生产上的薄弱环节，从而我们先后创制成功了自动化的剪口机、电木筒加工的元锯床以及大型折板机等十多台土设备，和完成了七十多项工具、工艺等技术革新，从而使全车间大部分手工操作变为机械化的生产，如其中的“元锯床”仅这一台土设备就解决了二十多种的电木管和绝缘零部件的手工操作，变成了机械化生产。经过这些技术革命和技术革新以后，就促使了全车间的生产能力提高了三倍。不但老工人闹技术革命，徒工也在搞改进。如入厂不久的十七岁的女徒工马秀芬搞出了一套标准划线样板，提高效率十多倍。今年国家给我厂的任务是很艰巨的，也是非常光荣的，在我们车间占有很大的比例，虽然有着一定的困难，但是我有决心来战胜困难，一定按着周总理在报告中所指示的：“只要我们有准备，并且努力去克服，那末，任何困难都不能阻挡我们取得胜利。”
    虚心学习决不骄傲，争取作出更多的贡献
    为此，我们要继续努力，克服前进当中的一切困难，我们要苦干、实干、巧干，大闹技术革命和技术革新，根据生产需要，再创制一台冲剪联合机，以代替五台洋设备，突破设备能力不足这一关。此外还要研究成功高电压变压器用的角环绕制机和曲线剪床，以及自动串垫块设备等四十多项技术革命和技术革新项目。作到人人都当多面手，决心在“十一”以前把绝缘车间由手工操作变成机械化的生产车间，给国庆十周年献礼。当我在党的教育和关怀下，做了这些工作以后，党和国家却给了我崇高的荣誉。沈阳市的劳动人民连续七年选我劳动模范，去年领导上把我这样一个普通工人提升为工程师，东北工学院还聘请我做兼职教授，党和国家给了我这么高的荣誉，更使我感到我的贡献太少了。我所以能从一个普通工人当了工程师，从一个认识不到几百字的人，提高到初中文化水平，这都是党对我培养和教育的结果。我衷心感谢党对我的培养教育，在党的领导和大家帮助下，虽然取得了点滴成绩，但是和党对我的要求还差的很远。我一定牢牢记住毛主席教导我们的话“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，我要永远的当好人民群众的勤务员，虚心学习别人的先进经验，努力的提高政治、文化、技术水平，继续鼓足冲天的革命干劲，保证出色的完成党给我的一切任务，创造新成绩，争取今年第四季度再次进北京，向党向毛主席报捷。
