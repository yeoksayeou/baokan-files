Nanchang, May 20th (From Our Newspaper) – Nankang County, Jiangxi Province, is launching a mass movement to create a high tide of fertilizer accumulation and production centered on the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers. The aim is to prepare sufficient quick-acting fertilizers to promote early-stage tillering of early rice, prevent ineffective late-stage tillering, and ensure a bumper harvest of early rice.

After the completion of early rice transplanting, the Nankang County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a county-wide inspection and appraisal. During the inspection, it was discovered that some cadres and masses believed that this year's early rice was transplanted early, the base fertilizer was sufficient, and the recovery was rapid, so fertilization was unnecessary to promote early tillering and achieve a bumper harvest. Therefore, some production teams applied very little topdressing during weeding and were reluctant to apply the fertilizer they had in stock. The fertilizer was particularly insufficient in some remote fields and marginal areas, resulting in weak growth of rice seedlings. In response to this situation, the County Committee required all localities to immediately launch a field management campaign centered on fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and topdressing, and to apply fertilizer according to the growth of the rice seedlings. Now, indigenous chemical fertilizer plants have been restored in various places, and large quantities of wall soil, crab shells, shellfish shells, bone meal and other raw materials are exchanged to produce indigenous chemical fertilizers. Production teams throughout the county have established specialized fertilizer accumulation and production teams, adopting various methods such as picking up, sweeping, digging,沤[retting],铲[shoveling], burning, 造[making], and exchanging to comprehensively carry out the fertilizer accumulation and production movement. Jishneg Commune mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and find fertilizer sources widely, and came up with and adopted the methods of "four cleanings" (sweeping the inside of the house clean, digging the outside of the house clean, carrying ditch water clean, sweeping ditch paths clean), "five creations" (creating indigenous chemical fertilizers, creating indigenous pesticides, creating granular fertilizers, creating artificial cattle manure, creating artificial urine), "three cuttings" (cutting green grass, reeds, and leaves), and "ten exchanges (diggings)" (digging the bottom of the manure tank, digging the bottom of the ash room, exchanging old wall soil, exchanging stove soil, exchanging chicken coops, exchanging duck coops, digging the mud from under the urine bucket, exchanging surface soil, digging the mud from under the cattle resting area, digging the corner of thatch). After five days of hard work, more than 34 million dan of various fertilizers were accumulated and produced. Many communes also mobilized the elderly and children to collect manure, adopting the method of cash purchase, which greatly stimulated their enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer.

In order to improve fertilizer efficiency, more than 1,100 granular fertilizer plants have also been established in various places, and 337,100 dan of granular fertilizer have been produced so far.

At present, most of the fertilizers accumulated and produced in various places have been applied to the fields. During the process of topdressing, various places have paid special attention to applying fertilizer according to the rice seedlings. For example, Longhua, Tangjiang and other communes applied more nitrogen fertilizer to the fields where the rice seedlings were slow to develop and the base fertilizer was less, while grass ash and indigenous chemical fertilizers were applied to other first and second class seedlings.

    促使早稻增加前期分蘖
    南康县积造速效肥料
    本报南昌20日电　江西南康县大搞群众运动，掀起以制造土化肥为中心的积肥造肥高潮，以准备充足的速效肥料，促进早稻前期分蘖，防止后期无效分蘖，确保早稻丰收。
    早稻插秧完毕后，中共南康县委组织了一次全县性的检查评比。在检查中，发现有部分干部和群众认为今年早稻插秧早，基肥比较足，返青快，不要下肥也可促使前期分蘖，赢得丰收。因此，个别生产队在耘田中，追肥很少，存有肥料也不愿施下田去。特别是在一些远田和边沿地区肥料更不够，以致禾苗生长不旺盛。针对这一情况，县委要求各地立即开展以积肥、造肥、追肥为中心的田间管理运动，按禾苗生长情况，看苗追肥。现在，各地都恢复了土制化肥厂，大量换取壁土和搜集螃壳、蚌壳、骨粉等原料制造土化肥。全县各地生产队都成立了积肥造肥专业队，采取拾、扫、挖、沤、铲、烧、造、换等各种办法，全面地开展了积肥造肥运动。积胜公社发动群众献计策，广找肥源，想出和采取了“四净”（屋内扫净、屋外刨净、沟水担净、沟道扫净）“五造”（造土化肥、造土农药、造颗粒肥、人造牛栏粪、人造尿）“三割”（割青草、芦苇、树叶）“十换（挖）”（挖粪缸底、挖灰间底、换老壁土、换灶土、换鸡栏、换鸭栏、挖尿桶地脚泥、换地皮泥、挖牛休息地底泥、挖茅草角）的办法，苦战五天，积、造各种肥料三千四百多万担。许多公社还发动老年人和小孩拾粪，采取现金收购的办法，大大地激发了他们的积肥积极性。
    为了提高肥效，各地还办起了一千一百多座颗粒肥料厂，目前已生产颗粒肥三十三万七千一百担。
    现在，各地所积、造的肥料，大部分已追下了田。在追施肥料的过程中，各地特别注意了看禾苗追肥，如龙华、唐江等公社对禾苗发兜较慢，底肥较少的田便多施氮肥，其他的一、二类苗便施草木灰、土化肥等。
