From our Jinan correspondent, May 19th: As soon as you enter the Beima Commune in Penglai County, Shandong Province, you can hear the sounds of waterwheels turning and pumps chugging day and night, as the people are engaged in a decisive battle to win a bumper wheat harvest.

The commune's 47,100+ mu of wheat has already been universally watered twice and fertilized three times. The wheat is growing strongly and mostly in the heading and flowering stages. However, at this very moment, some cadres and commune members are developing a sense of complacency: Some believe that as long as the wheat has headed, it will be guaranteed a harvest even without further management; others believe that there is no need to water heavily once the wheat has headed. After discovering these two kinds of thinking, the Commune Party Committee immediately convened a field meeting of cadres above the production team leader level in the Zhongjia Brigade. They observed the growth of wheat that had been watered and wheat that had not been watered, and summarized the lessons learned from last year when the southwest wind blew for a few days during the heading and flowering period. Those who watered increased production, while those who did not water suffered reduced yields because the grains did not fully mature. For example, last year, under the same conditions, the 11th Production Team of the Zhongjia Brigade watered in a timely manner during the heading stage, resulting in a yield of 20 jin per mu more than the 10th Team. Through factual education and open discussions, the cadres at the meeting clarified their thinking and recognized that strengthening late-stage management is the decisive key to a bumper wheat harvest. They criticized complacency and other slack attitudes, and launched a "Six Comparisons Red Flag Competition" campaign, comparing attendance, drive, progressiveness, and quality. After the meeting, a vigorous high tide of late-stage wheat management was formed throughout the commune. Truly, people, animals, and tools are all busy, determined to fight for large ears, numerous grains, and plump kernels of wheat. The production conditions of the 8th Production Team of the Zhongjia Brigade are poorer than those of other teams, and most of the wheat fields are located on high ground. Now the water level in the wells has gradually decreased, and the water source is insufficient. The team leader, Sun Youtai, and Comrade Ma Huaili, in order to shake off the label of poor production conditions, took the lead in digging wells to increase the amount of water. As a result, the heading and flowering water of this team's wheat has almost been completed.

Currently, the commune has watered 80% of its wheat during the heading and flowering stage, and they plan to water it again before the wheat harvest.

    蓬莱北马公社
    辘轳抽水机齐唱歌
    要叫亩产量更加多
    本报济南19日电　一踏进山东蓬莱县的北马公社，到处可以听见哗啦哗啦挽水的辘轳声，风力水车迎风嘟嘟地转动，抽水机昼夜咚咚的叫个不停，人们正为夺取小麦丰收进行决战。
    这个公社的四万七千一百多亩小麦已普遍浇了二次水，追了三遍肥，现在块块长得茁壮，并大部分抽穗扬花。可是，就在这个时候，有一部分干部和社员产生了麻痹思想：一部分人认为只要小麦抽了穗不管理也保收；另一部分人则认为小麦抽穗了就用不着浇大水。公社党委发现上述两种思想之后，立即在仲家大队召开了生产队长以上的干部现场会议，参观了浇水与不浇水小麦的生长情况，总结了去年正在抽穗扬花时期刮了几天西南风，浇了水的增了产，没浇水的，籽粒没攻满而减了产的经验教训。如去年仲家大队第十生产队和十一生产队，在同样条件下，十一生产队适时浇了抽穗水，结果每亩比十队多收二十斤。会议通过事实教育和鸣放辩论，到会干部思想明确了，认识了加强后期管理是小麦丰收的决定关键，纷纷批判了定局论等松劲情绪，开展了比出勤、比干劲、比先进、比质量等六比红旗竞赛运动。会后一个轰轰烈烈的小麦后期管理高潮在全社形成了。真是人、畜、工具一齐忙，决心为小麦穗大、粒多、粒饱而战。仲家大队第八生产队的生产条件比其他队较差，麦田多系高地，现在井的水位已逐渐下降，水源不足。这个队的队长孙友太和马怀利同志为了摘掉生产条件差的帽子，就带头掏井，以增加水量。因此，这个队的小麦抽穗扬花水已接近浇完。
    目前这个社小麦抽穗扬花水已浇到80％，他们计划麦收之前还要浇一水。
