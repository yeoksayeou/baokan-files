Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 27th: The Soviet Party and Government delegation headed by Khrushchev, accompanied by Albanian Party and state leaders such as Hoxha and Shehu, visited the Stalin Textile Factory in Tirana on the 26th.

After the visit, the delegation attended a grand welcoming rally held by the workers. Khrushchev delivered a long speech at the meeting. He said that yesterday, we held the first talks with the Party and Government leaders of the People's Republic of Albania. We have never had any issues to argue about, and we have no issues that need arguing now. It can be said that this is the best kind of comradely and fraternal meeting. We exchanged opinions on the situation in your country and our country. Things are going well in both of our countries. However, both you and we have much work to do in order to move towards the sacred goal pointed out by Marx and Lenin—building a communist society—together with all socialist countries. We must achieve this goal.

Then, he talked about the current international situation. He said, we believe that the current international situation is not bad, and it can even be said that the situation is good. The Soviet Union, the Soviet government, is fully confident that as long as the correct policy is implemented, military conflicts can be avoided.

As everyone knows, a foreign ministers' conference is being held in Geneva to discuss important international issues. We hope that the conference can find solutions to international problems that will help eliminate the "Cold War" situation and consolidate world peace.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Western countries have expounded their positions at the Geneva conference. However, their positions are essentially no different from their past proposals and do not provide a basis for reaching an agreement. They verbally agree to reach an agreement, but in action, they do not try to reach an agreement. The Western countries’ proposals are entangled in a mess, and proposals in this form are unacceptable.

Khrushchev then talked about the prospects for a summit conference. He said that there are now many important and mature issues that urgently need to be agreed upon. We advocate holding meetings with heads of government of various countries, and we advocate reaching agreements with them on a sensible basis. Where, in which country, to hold such a meeting is not important to us. For us, the main thing is that such a meeting is beneficial and that world peace is consolidated.

In his speech, Khrushchev expressed sincere condolences to the American government on the death of Dulles, who had served as the US Secretary of State for many years. He said, some people may say: does this condolence correspond with my repeated opposition to Dulles and the policies he pursued? Yes, it does. On fundamental, principled issues, we were Dulles’s enemies. Dulles pursued his own policies. When A. I. Mikoyan visited the United States, he talked with Dulles. From this conversation, it can be understood that Dulles abandoned his previous practice, which was: ignoring the will of the people of Eastern European countries, and some people in the United States stubbornly tried to restore the outdated old order in these countries, attempting to rely on the so-called "policy of strength" to push these countries back to the past capitalist era. Khrushchev said that it seems that Dulles finally understood that this policy was completely untenable.

Khrushchev continued, Mr. Dulles’s remarks on the German question are also noteworthy. He said that the path to German reunification is not only through "free elections," but there can also be other paths. As the head of the Soviet government, I value these good words of Mr. Dulles.

Khrushchev said that Dulles was a great politician. He was certainly safeguarding the interests of his own class. His anti-communist patent was so high that as long as he made any decision, even if this decision did not seem to conform to the dogma of imperialism, no one would say that he sympathized with communism. Others, seeing that socialist countries have put forward sensible proposals, will tremble and be afraid to accept these proposals, for fear that someone will suspect him of sympathizing with communism. But Dulles was not afraid of this; in the last few months of his life, he showed a more sober understanding of the current international situation.

However, the government's policy mainly does not depend on individuals; it depends on the position of the ruling class.

Khrushchev then talked about Albania's neighbors, Italy and Greece. He said that the Soviet Union has concluded a peace treaty with Italy, and now we hope to have friendly relations with it. We have good feelings towards the hardworking Italian people. However, regrettably, the Italian ruling group is pursuing a policy that does not conform to the interests of the Italian people.

The Italian government, against the will of the Italian people, recently agreed to establish American rocket bases on Italian territory. Now, the United States is negotiating with the Greek government on the establishment of rocket bases on its territory. It is obvious that the purpose of establishing these bases is to oppose the Soviet Union, Albania, and other socialist countries.

The Soviet government has drawn the attention of the Italian and Greek governments to the fact that this policy harbors serious consequences and threatens the security of the people of all countries. We propose to make the Balkan Peninsula a peninsula of peace, where there are neither rockets nor atomic weapons. This is beneficial to the Greek people, to the Italian people, and to the people of all countries living in the Balkan Peninsula and living in the Mediterranean region.

Efforts should be made to ensure that the whole world abandons nuclear weapons. This would make the people of all countries in the world feel relieved.

Khrushchev emphasized that if the Italian and Greek governments allow the Americans to establish rocket bases on their territories, then we may have to reach an agreement with the government of the People's Republic of Albania to think of a way to deal with them here.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Americans have set up intermediate-range rockets in Italy. However, if intermediate-range rockets or even short-range rockets are set up in Albania, then the whole of Italy will be within range. Therefore, short-range rockets are enough here.

Khrushchev continued, the same can be said for Greece. If, as the saying goes, the devil entangles the Greek government and it makes an irrational decision to allow the Americans to set up rocket bases on its territory, then it is forcing us to strengthen our forces to give due response. Where to deploy our rocket facilities—here, in Albania, or launch rockets from Bulgaria or other countries to hit the Greek rocket bases, we are going to talk about this and reach an agreement with each other, the problem is not here. Now there are rockets that do not fly hundreds of kilometers, but thousands of kilometers, accurately to their destination, and where to install such rockets, we have huge possibilities here.

Khrushchev emphasized that we have said in the past and now say: The Soviet Union and all socialist countries hope to defend world peace. Therefore, it is wise not to build rocket bases around the Soviet Union and socialist countries, but to dismantle these bases, so as to help consolidate peace. However, if the Italian and Greek governments establish American rocket bases on their territories, then these countries will attract our rockets like magnets.

Khrushchev then talked about the growing strength of the socialist camp, which the imperialists have to take into account. He said that we long for peace and will never start a war. However, if the imperialists attempt to attack us, we will give them the response they deserve, and they will suffer.

Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, also delivered an enthusiastic speech at the welcoming rally.

    赫鲁晓夫在地拉那发表演说
    希望日内瓦会议有助于消除“冷战”
    警告意大利和希腊政府不要在国土上建立美国火箭基地
    据新华社地拉那27日电  以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联党政代表团26日由霍查、谢胡等阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人陪同，参观了地拉那的斯大林纺织工厂。
    参观后，代表团参加了工人们举行的盛大欢迎会。赫鲁晓夫在会上发表了长篇演说。他说，昨天，我们同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的党政领导人举行了第一次会谈。我们之间从来没有过任何争论的问题，我们现在也没有任何需要争论的问题。可以说，这是最好的同志式的兄弟会谈。我们就你们国家和我们国家的情况交换了意见。我们两个国家的事情办得都很好。但是，无论是你们还是我们，都要做许多工作，以便同所有社会主义国家一道走向马克思和列宁所指出的神圣目标——建成共产主义社会。我们一定要达到这个目标。
    接着，他谈到了当前的国际局势问题。他说，我们认为，当前的国际局势是不坏的，甚至可以说，局势是好的。苏联、苏联政府完全相信，只要执行正确的政策，就可以排除军事冲突。
    大家知道，现在，在日内瓦正举行着外长会议，商讨重要的国际问题。我们希望，会议能求得这样的解决国际问题的办法，这种办法有助于消除“冷战”状况和巩固世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，西方国家在日内瓦会议上阐述了自己的立场。可是，它们的立场实质上同它们过去的建议没有区别，并没有提供达成协议的基础。它们在口头上赞成达成协议，但是，在行动上却不设法达成协议。西方国家的建议纠缠不清地捆成一团，这种形式的建议是无法接受的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了政府首脑会议的前景。他说，现在有许多成熟了的重要问题迫切需要达成协议。我们主张同各国政府首脑举行会议，主张同他们在明智的基础上达成协议。在什么地方，在哪个国家举行这种会议，对我们来说是不关紧要的。对我们来说，主要的是使这种会议有好处，使世界和平得到巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲演中，对多年担任美国国务卿的杜勒斯的逝世，向美国政府表示诚挚的哀悼。他说，某些人可能说：这种哀悼同我多次反对杜勒斯和他所执行的政策，相符合吗？是的，相符合的。在根本的、原则性的问题上，我们是杜勒斯的敌人。杜勒斯奉行了自己的政策。阿·伊·米高扬访问美国的时候，曾和杜勒斯谈过话。从这次谈话中可以理解到，杜勒斯放弃了以前的做法，这种做法就是：忽视东欧各国人民的意志，美国的某些人士顽固地企图使这些国家中已过时的旧秩序复辟，企图依靠所谓“实力政策”来把这些国家推回过去的资本主义时代。赫鲁晓夫说，看来，杜勒斯终于也明白了这种政策是完全站不住脚的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，杜勒斯先生关于德国问题的谈话也是值得注意的。他说过，德国重新统一的途径不只是通过“自由选举”，而且也可以有其他的途径。作为苏联政府的首脑，我重视杜勒斯先生这些很好的话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，杜勒斯是一个大政治家。他当然是维护本阶级的利益的。他的反共的专利权高到这种程度：只要他作出什么决定，即使这个决定看来并不符合帝国主义的教旨，也不致于会有人说他同情共产主义。别的人看到社会主义国家提出了明智的建议，就会发抖，就害怕接受这些建议，因为唯恐有人怀疑他同情共产主义。而杜勒斯却不怕这个；他在生前最后几个月中，曾经表现出对目前的国际局势有了比较冷静的理解。
    但是，政府的政策主要的不是取决于个别的人；它取决于统治阶级的立场。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了阿尔巴尼亚的邻国意大利和希腊。他说，苏联已经同意大利缔结了和约，现在，我们希望同它有友好关系。我们对勤劳的意大利人民抱着好感。但是，遗憾的是，意大利统治集团奉行的是一种不符合意大利人民利益的政策。
    意大利政府违反意大利人民的意志，不久前同意在意大利领土上建立美国火箭基地。现在，美国又同希腊政府进行关于在它的领土上建立火箭基地的谈判。很明显，建立这些基地目的在于反对苏联、反对阿尔巴尼亚和其他社会主义国家。
    苏联政府曾经提请意大利和希腊政府注意，这种政策孕育着严重的后果，它威胁着各国人民的安全。我们建议使巴尔干半岛成为和平的半岛，在这里既没有火箭，也没有原子武器。这对希腊人民、对意大利人民、对居住在巴尔干半岛和居住在地中海区域的各国人民都是有利的。
    应当争取使全世界都放弃核武器。这样会使世界各国人民感到如释重负。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，如果意大利和希腊政府允许美国人在自己的领土上建立火箭基地，那末，可能我们不得不同阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府达成协议，在这里想个什么办法来对付它们。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国人在意大利设置了中程火箭。但是，如果在阿尔巴尼亚设置中程火箭或甚至近程火箭，那么整个意大利就都会处在射击范围以内。因此，这里只要近程火箭就够了。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，对希腊也可以这样说。如果像俗话所说的那样，恶魔缠住了希腊政府，它要作出不理智的决定，允许美国人在自己的领土上设立火箭基地，那么，它就是迫使我们加强力量来给予应有的回答。在哪里配置我们的火箭设施——在这里，在阿尔巴尼亚，还是从保加利亚或其他国家发射火箭来打希腊的火箭基地，关于这一点，我们是要谈的，彼此之间要达成协议的，问题不在这里。现在有这样的火箭，它们不是飞过数百公里，而是飞过数千公里，准确地飞向目的地，而在哪里安装这样的火箭呢，在我们这里有巨大的可能性。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，我们过去和现在都说：苏联和所有社会主义国家都希望保卫世界和平。因此，不是在苏联和社会主义国家周围建立火箭基地，而是撤除这些基地，才是明智的，这样才能有助于巩固和平。但是，如果意大利和希腊政府在本国领土上建立美国火箭基地，那么，这样一来，这些国家就将会像磁石一样吸引我们的火箭。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到，社会主义阵营的力量日益增长，帝国主义者也不得不考虑到这一点。他说，我们渴望和平，永远不发动战争。但是，如果帝国主义竟然企图进攻我们，我们就将给他们以应有的回击，他们是会尝到苦头的。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查也在欢迎会上发表了热情的讲话。
