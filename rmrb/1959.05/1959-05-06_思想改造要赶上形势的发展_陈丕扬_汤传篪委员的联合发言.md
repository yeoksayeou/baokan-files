Chairman, fellow commissioners:

We fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the work reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and others. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our motherland has made great achievements on all fronts in the past decade. In particular, since the unveiling of the all-round Great Leap Forward in 1958, it is developing at an even faster pace, fully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of our social system and encouraging the people of the whole country to resolutely follow the path of socialism. China's national economic plan for 1959 is a rather grand plan, based on our country's practical experience in recent years. It takes into account both the objective possibilities of our country's material and technical conditions and the subjective initiative of the people's revolutionary enthusiasm. As long as we adhere to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and advance along the lighthouse of the general line of socialist construction, this grand plan can not only be realized but also be overfulfilled. Let us continue to exert our utmost efforts and strive for excellence, to achieve and overfulfill the grand plan for 1959 in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Our country is leaping forward at an incredible pace. As our motherland strides forward, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "to build a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals," "this contingent must be produced by cultivating new intellectuals and transforming old intellectuals." Over the past few years, under the education and cultivation of the Party, and in the process of continuous remolding, some of us old intellectuals have begun to transform into working-class intellectuals, but there are still some old intellectuals whose ideological remolding has not kept up with the development of the situation. In order to rapidly transform the bourgeois world outlook of old intellectuals, we, as old intellectuals, should continue to work hard to remold ourselves. We must unswervingly accept the leadership of the Party, contribute all our strength in our different work posts, participate in the great construction of the motherland, and transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals through work practice, theoretical study, and participation in labor training with the broad masses.

Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper-class group launched an armed rebellion and abducted the Dalai Lama. Their crimes of colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland are attempts to undermine the unity of the motherland, restore the imperialist aggressive forces in Tibet, and preserve the reactionary and cruel serf system in Tibet. The State Council's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and completely quell the rebellion has been warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, and especially warmly welcomed by the broad patriotic monks and laypeople in Tibet. With their active support, the People's Liberation Army troops and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region have completely controlled the situation in Tibet and wiped out the rebel bandits in the Shannan area of Tibet in one fell swoop, causing the conspiracies of the Tibetan reactionary upper class, imperialism, and foreign reactionaries to suffer a shameful defeat; enabling the Tibetan people to get rid of the shackles of the serf system and realize the great desire for democratic autonomy. We are very indignant that some interventionists in India are taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble; and the Indian diplomatic officials distributed the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" on April 18, which is a ridiculous and shameless fabrication! The open interference in our country's internal affairs by Indian ambitious people is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. We firmly oppose any foreign reactionaries interfering in our country's internal affairs. The people of all ethnic groups in the motherland are firmly united around the Party, loyal to the cause of the Party, and marching towards a prosperous and happy socialist and communist society.

I wish the conference a successful conclusion and good health to all commissioners.

　　思想改造要赶上形势的发展
    陈丕扬　汤传篪委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念两位副总理、李维汉副主席等有关工作报告。祖国十年来在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在各个战线上均已取得了伟大成就，特别是一九五八年在揭开了全面大跃进的序幕后，正以更高速度向前发展，充分说明了我国社会制度的无比优越性，也鼓舞了全国人民坚决走社会主义的道路。一九五九年我国国民经济计划是一个相当宏伟的计划，它是根据我国几年来实践经验，既考虑到我国物质技术条件的客观可能性，也考虑了人民群众革命干劲的主观能动性，只要我们坚持在党和毛主席的领导下，沿着社会主义建设总路线的灯塔前进，这个宏伟计划不但能够实现，而且是能够超额完成的。让我们继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地为实现和超额完成一九五九年的宏伟计划而奋斗。
    我们国家正在一日千里的向前飞跃。在祖国大踏步向前迈进的时候，正如周总理在报告里指出的，“建立一支成千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍”，“这支队伍要依靠培养新知识分子和改造旧知识分子而产生”。我们旧知识分子几年来在党的教育和培养下，在不断改造的过程中，有些已经开始转变为工人阶级的知识分子，但仍有一部分旧知识分子在思想改造方面，还赶不上形势的发展。为了迅速的转变旧知识分子的资产阶级世界观，我们作为一个旧知识分子，应当继续努力改造自己，必须坚定不移地接受党的领导，在各个不同的工作岗位上贡献出一切力量，参加到祖国伟大的建设行列中去，并且通过工作实践、理论学习、和广大群众一起参加劳动锻炼，把自己改造为工人阶级知识分子。
    最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团发动了武装叛乱，并劫走达赖喇嘛。他们勾结帝国主义和外国反动派背叛祖国的罪行，是企图破坏祖国的统一，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，和保存西藏反动残酷的农奴制度。国务院关于解散西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令，得到了全国各族人民的热烈拥护和支持，特别是受到西藏广大爱国僧俗人民的热烈欢迎。在他们的积极支持下，人民解放军部队和西藏自治区筹委会，已完全控制了西藏的局势，并一举荡平了西藏山南地区的叛匪，使西藏上层反动分子、帝国主义和外国反动派的阴谋遭到可耻失败；使西藏人民将摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治的伟大愿望。我们非常愤慨的是，印度某些干涉主义分子利用西藏的叛乱事件，兴风作浪；而印度的外交官员于四月十八日散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这个声明是荒谬无耻的捏造！印度野心家又公开干涉我国内政，是我国人民绝对不能容忍。我们坚决反对任何外国反动派干涉我国内政。祖国各族人民坚定的团结在党的周围，忠于党的事业，走向繁荣幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会。
    祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。
