Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 16th: Czechoslovak President and First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, Novotný, said at a mass rally held in Pilsen this morning, "Our participation in the Geneva conference is our moral and political right, and the representatives of the West should respect this right." He also said, "We hope to contribute to a peaceful understanding in the world. Our primary concern is to obtain a foolproof guarantee against West German militarists and revanchists once and for all."

Referring to the Western countries' rejection of the Soviet proposal to allow Czechoslovakia and Poland to participate in the Geneva conference, Novotný said, "We believe that the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France should reconsider whether Czechoslovakia and Poland should not participate in such serious negotiations between foreign ministers as the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the settlement of the West Berlin issue."

This morning, more than 50,000 working people in the Pilsen region held a mass rally to commemorate the centenary of the V. I. Lenin factory in Pilsen. The party and government delegation headed by Novotný inspected the factory this morning and presented the factory with the Order of Klement Gottwald for Socialist Homeland Construction at the commemorative ceremony.

    诺沃提尼发表演说
    捷有权参加外长会议
    新华社布拉格16日电　捷克斯洛伐克总统、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼今天上午在比尔森举行的群众大会上说：“我国参加日内瓦会议是我国在道义上、政治上的权利，西方的代表应当尊重这个权利。”他还说：“我们希望对世界的和平谅解有所贡献。我们最关心的是要一劳永逸地对防止西德军国主义者和复仇主义者一事获得保障。”
    诺沃提尼在提到西方国家拒绝苏联提出的关于让捷克斯洛伐克和波兰参加这次日内瓦会议的建议时说，“我们认为，美国、英国和法国的代表应当重新考虑一下，捷克斯洛伐克和波兰是否不应当参加像缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题这样严肃的外长谈判。”
    今天上午比尔森地区的五万多名劳动人民举行了群众大会，纪念比尔森符·伊·列宁工厂成立一百周年。以诺沃提尼为首的党和政府代表团在这一天早上视察了这个工厂，并在纪念仪式上把社会主义祖国建设克利门特·哥特瓦尔德勋章授予这个工厂。
