    Rebel Lhalu Tsewang Dorje was originally the son of the imperialist running dog Lungshar. During the time of the 13th Dalai Lama, he married into the Lhalu family. He was insidious and vicious, a well-known careerist among the Tibetan nobles. In 1945, he bribed his way into the position of Kalon with 250,000 taels of Tibetan silver. Because his father, Lungshar, was executed by Reting, he actively participated in the heinous crimes of murdering Reting and the father of the current Dalai Lama in order to avenge his personal feud and expand his power.

    During his tenure as General Manager of Qamdo, Lhalu's oppression and exploitation of the masses were extremely cruel, arousing strong opposition from the local people. On the eve of liberation, he colluded with British imperialist spies to murder Geda Living Buddha. When our People's Liberation Army approached Qamdo, the Tibetan local government transferred him back to Lhasa to serve as Kalon.

    After the liberation of Tibet, Lhalu and Lukhangwa joined together, spreading reactionary remarks and undermining the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities. In 1952, the Dalai Lama, on the grounds that he had cruelly oppressed and exploited the local masses during his tenure as General Manager of Qamdo, ordered his dismissal from the position of Kalon. He is one of the masterminds behind this rebellion.

    叛匪拉鲁·泽旺仁曾
    拉鲁·泽旺仁曾本系帝国主义走狗龙厦之子，十三世达赖时，入赘于拉鲁家。他为人阴险恶毒，是西藏贵族当中有名的野心家，他于1945年以二十五万两藏银贿得噶伦的职位。由于他的父亲龙厦是被热振处死的，他为了报复私仇和发展权势，积极参与谋杀热振及本世达赖喇嘛的父亲的罪恶勾当。
    拉鲁在任昌都总管期间，对群众的压榨和搜刮极为苛暴，引起当地人民的强烈反对。解放前夕，他勾结英帝国主义特务谋杀格达活佛。当我人民解放军逼近昌都时，西藏地方政府将他调回拉萨任噶伦。
    西藏解放后，拉鲁和鲁康娃结合在一起，散布反动言论，破坏汉藏民族团结，1952年，达赖下令以其在昌都总管任内残酷地压榨剥削当地群众等为理由，宣布撤去他的噶伦的职务。他是这次叛乱的策动者之一。
