Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 15th. Calcutta's "Liberty" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "Let Interference Cease," welcoming the "People's Daily" editorial of May 6th, considering it a "major event." The newspaper published the full text of the article in a special supplement on May 13th.

The editorial stated, "The anti-China smear campaign has subsided. Those who interfere in China's internal affairs on the Tibet issue not only fail to receive the support of our compatriots but are opposed by them. How much longer can these interference activities, which spread hatred and tension, continue? Such practices only expose their own reactionary nature."

The editorial also praised Nehru's advice to members of the Congress Party not to take irresponsible actions on the Tibet issue. It pointed out that this is a good sign conducive to Sino-Indian friendship, Panchsheel, and the Bandung principles.

The newspaper called on the Indian people to carefully read the "People's Daily" article, saying, "It contains detailed facts explaining when and under what circumstances" certain people in India "interfered in Chinese affairs on the Tibet issue."

It said, "Although the facts are unpleasant, this document states these facts without hesitation." It said, "This document issues a sincere call for strengthening Sino-Indian friendship because the article shows an urgent need to strengthen the struggle against imperialism to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of both countries." It added that this document is helpful in recognizing the enemies of Sino-Indian friendship.

The editorial pointed out that leaders of the People's League have not abandoned their rhetoric of recruiting "volunteers" for Tibetan rebels, and Kripalani and other leaders of the Praja Socialist Party are still talking about Tibet's "independence."

The newspaper said, "If the leaders of the Praja Socialist Party and the People's League were not encouraged by the government's actions, they would not delay canceling their 'movement' upon seeing the sound wisdom of our compatriots. Therefore, our compatriots will demand that the government quickly fulfill its unfinished obligations to completely eliminate activities interfering in China's internal affairs."

    印度“自由报”欢迎“人民日报”编辑部文章
    呼吁停止干涉中国内政的活动
    新华社新德里15日电　加尔各答“自由报”14日发表了一篇题为“让干涉停止”的社论，欢迎5月6日“人民日报”编辑部的文章，认为这是一个“重大事件”。报纸在5月13日的特别增刊中刊载了这篇文章的全文。
    社论说，“反华污蔑运动已经缓和下来了。在西藏问题上干涉中国内政的人不但得不到我国同胞的支持，反而遭到他们的反对。这些干涉者散布仇恨和紧张毒素的这种做法倒底还能继续多久呢？这种做法只会暴露他们自己的反动性质。”
    社论还赞扬尼赫鲁对国大党人的劝告，即不要在西藏问题上采取不负责任的行动。它指出，这是有利于印中友好、潘查希拉和万隆原则的好现象。
    报纸号召印度人民仔细阅读“人民日报”的文章，并且说，“它包含着详细的事实，说明在什么时候，在什么情况下”，印度某些人“在西藏问题上对中国事务进行了干涉。”
    它说，“尽管事实是令人不愉快的，但是这个文件还是毫不犹豫地说明了这些事实”。它说，“这个文件发出了要求加强印中友谊的真诚呼声。因为文章表明迫切需要加强反对帝国主义的斗争来维护两国的独立和主权”。它又说，这个文件对于认清印中友谊的敌人是很有帮助的。
    社论指出，人民同盟领导人还没有放弃他们要为西藏叛乱分子招募“志愿军”的言论，克里帕拉尼和人民社会党的其他领导人还在继续谈论西藏的“独立”。
    这家报纸说，“如果人民社会党人和人民同盟的领导人不是从政府的行动中得到鼓励，那末看到我国同胞的健全的智慧，他们将不能迟迟不取消他们的‘运动’。因此，我国同胞将要求政府迅速履行尚未完成的义务，以便彻底摆脱干涉中国内部事务的活动”。
