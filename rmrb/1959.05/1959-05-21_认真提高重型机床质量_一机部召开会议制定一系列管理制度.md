Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 26th. The National Heavy Machine Tool Professional Conference recently convened in Wuhan by the First Ministry of Machine Building earnestly discussed issues related to ensuring the quality of heavy machine tools. The conference believed that heavy machine tools are important production tools for the machinery industry, and poor quality has a huge impact on the development of the machinery manufacturing industry. To ensure the quality of heavy machine tools, it is necessary to strengthen technical inspections and earnestly rectify and consolidate technical management systems such as product design and technology.

In order to ensure the design and manufacturing quality of new products, the conference stipulated that in the future, heavy, large, precision, and advanced machine tools, as well as machine tools produced in large batches, must undergo a comprehensive appraisal by the relevant higher-level acceptance organizations after the trial production is completed. After discussion, the conference formulated a series of management systems related to ensuring product quality, such as the design review system and the new product appraisal system.

At the meeting, detailed discussions were also held on two issues closely related to product quality: the use of reinforced concrete structural parts in machine tools and the simplification of machine tool structures.

The conference also discussed issues such as the product range of heavy machine tools and the division of labor among factories, and formulated draft product ranges for six major categories of heavy machine tools suitable for China's conditions: vertical lathes, horizontal lathes, boring machines, gear hobbing machines, gantry planers, and gantry milling machines. This will not only facilitate the maximum use of standard parts and components in future design and manufacturing, making machine tool manufacturing economical and rational; but it will also help unify the pace of various manufacturing plants and concentrate efforts to meet the needs of the national economy. The compilation of product ranges for special heavy machine tools required by various industries will also be carried out by relevant factories responsible for investigation and research.

The conference made specific arrangements for the division of labor among various heavy machine tool factories. The principle of the division of labor is mainly based on the spirit of the national unified plan, the existing production conditions of each factory, and the prospects for future development. The conference believes that it is necessary to ensure the supply and to clearly divide the series of machine tools produced by each factory, avoiding duplication of production. This will save technical strength, and the employees of each factory will also be able to quickly master the production of professional products, thereby ensuring improved product quality and reduced costs.

    认真提高重型机床质量
    一机部召开会议制定一系列管理制度
    新华社武汉26日电　第一机械工业部最近在武汉市召开的全国重型机床专业会议，认真讨论了保证重型机床质量的有关问题。会议认为，重型机床是机械工业的重要生产工具，质量不好对发展机械制造业有着巨大的影响。保证重型机床的质量，必须加强技术检查，切实整顿与巩固产品设计、工艺等技术管理制度。
    为了保证新产品的设计和制造质量，会议规定，今后对重、大、精、尖机床和成批生产数量较大的机床，在试制完成后，必须由上级有关验收机构作出全面鉴定。会议经过讨论，制订了一系列有关保证产品质量的管理制度，如设计审查制度、新产品鉴定制度等。
    会上对与产品质量有密切关系的两个问题——在机床上采用钢筋水泥结构零件和精简机床结构问题，也都进行了详细的讨论。
    会议还就重型机床的型谱、各厂的产品分工等问题作了讨论，并且制定了立车、卧车、镗床、滚齿机、龙门刨床和龙门铣床等六大类适合我国情况的重型机床型谱草案。这样，不仅便于今后在设计制造中最大限度地采用标准零件和部件，使机床制造经济合理；而且也将有利于统一各制造厂的步调，集中力量满足国民经济的需要。至于各行业所需要的专用重型机床的型谱编制工作，也将由有关厂负责进行调查研究。
    会议对各重型机床厂之间的产品分工作出了具体安排。分工的原则主要是根据全国一盘棋的精神、各厂的现有生产条件和今后发展远景来决定。会议认为必须在保证供应的情况下，对各厂生产机床的系列品种做到明确分工，避免重复生产。这样将节约技术力量，各厂职工也将能迅速掌握专业产品的生产，从而保证提高产品质量和降低成本。
