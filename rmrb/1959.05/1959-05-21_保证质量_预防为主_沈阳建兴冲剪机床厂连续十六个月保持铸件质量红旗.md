    Ensure Quality, Prevention First
    Shenyang Jianxing Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory Maintains Casting Quality Red Flag for Sixteen Consecutive Months
    This newspaper Shenyang, 20th dispatch. The Shenyang Jianxing Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory has earnestly implemented the principle of "prevention first" and the method of combining inspection by full-time personnel with mass inspection, creating a set of management systems and operating methods to prevent defective products and improve quality, and has maintained the Shenyang City Casting Red Flag for sixteen consecutive months.
    The castings produced by the Shenyang Jianxing Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory account for more than 80% of the factory's total product output. The casting qualification rate has consistently remained above 99%. The casting qualification rate in April of this year even reached 99.983%, with a defect rate of only 0.017%, setting a new record for high-quality sand casting. Because of the excellent sand casting quality, it ensures that all kinds of punching and shearing machine tools in the factory can complete the state plan with guaranteed quality and quantity.
    How does the Jianxing Machine Tool Factory improve the quality of castings? The main thing is that they have a correct guiding ideology. Over the past year, according to the principle of "prevention first, prevention is more important than cure," the factory has unswervingly implemented the method of combining inspection by full-time personnel and mass inspection. On the one hand, they mobilize the masses to participate in the quality inspection of products. At the same time, full-time inspectors strictly implement the inspection system, paying attention not only to the inspection of finished products, but also to the inspection of the entire operation process. If a defective product is found, a "on-site appraisal meeting" is immediately held in the team that produced the defective product, inviting representatives from other teams to participate, to find the cause and think of solutions. In order to prevent quality accidents, production teams have also established a system of "three meetings" (post-shift meeting, quality analysis meeting, and technical research meeting). The team's post-shift meeting focuses on summarizing the day's work experience and lessons learned, and arranges the tasks for the next day. The quality analysis meeting mainly studies the experience of not producing defective products and the causes of defective products. Through quality analysis, workers improve their overall production perspective. The content of technical research is mainly for new products and technically complex work. The person in charge of production technology, technicians, and veteran workers, as well as relevant personnel from the team accepting the task, participate in the discussion to discuss what problems may occur and how to prevent them, in order to strengthen technical foresight and prevent quality accidents to the greatest extent.
    In addition, they also studied the "three checks, five goods, and turnover" casting operation method of the Dalian No. 3 Machine Factory. According to the specific conditions of small operating area and poor equipment conditions in their factory, they found the eight major defects such as sand holes and air holes that often occur in the factory's castings and solutions, and creatively formulated the "four checks, four cleans, and eight goods turnover" operating method, which was conscientiously implemented in the teams. The model team—Sun Maolin's team—has to undertake more than 130 tons of casting tasks every month, but they have not produced a single defective product for sixteen consecutive months from 1958 to the present.

    保证质量  预防为主
    沈阳建兴冲剪机床厂连续十六个月保持铸件质量红旗
    本报沈阳20日电　沈阳建兴冲剪机床厂切实贯彻了“预防为主”的方针和专职人员检查和群众检查相结合的方法，创造了一套防止废品、提高质量的管理制度和操作方法，连续十六个月保持了沈阳市铸件红旗。
    沈阳建兴冲剪机床厂生产的铸件占全厂产品产量的80％以上，铸件合格率始终保持在99％以上，今年4月份的铸件合格率更高达99.983％，废品率仅有0.017％，创造了翻砂优质的新纪录。由于翻砂质量优良，就保证了全厂各种冲剪机床都能按质按量地完成国家计划。
    建兴机床厂是怎样提高铸件质量的呢？主要是有着正确的指导思想。一年多来，这个厂根据“预防为主，防重于治”的方针，坚定不移地执行了专职人员检查和群众检查相结合的方法。一方面发动群众参加产品的质量检查，同时专职检查人员严格执行检验制度，不仅注意成品的检查，还注意整个操作过程的检查，发现那里有废品，就立即在出废品的小组召开“现场鉴定会”，吸收其他小组代表参加，大家找原因，想办法。为了预防质量事故，生产小组还建立“三个会”（班后会，质量分析会，技术研究会）的制度。小组班后会以总结当天工作经验教训为中心，并布置第二天的任务。质量分析会主要研究不出废品的经验和产生废品的原因。通过质量分析，提高工人全面生产的观点。技术研究的内容，主要是针对新产品和技术复杂的活，由生产技术负责人、技术员和老工人，并吸收接受任务小组的有关人员参加，讨论可能发生什么问题，怎样防止，以加强技术预见性，最大限度地防止质量事故的发生。
    此外，他们还学习了大连机械三厂“三查五好倒”的铸造操作方法，根据本厂作业面积小，设备条件差的具体情况，找出了本厂铸件经常出废品的砂眼、气孔等八大毛病和解决办法，创造性地制订了“四检四净八好倒”的操作方法，认真在小组里贯彻。模范小组——孙茂林小组每月都要担负着一百三十多吨的铸造任务，但他们从1958年到现在连续十六个月没有出过一件废品。
