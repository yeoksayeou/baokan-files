Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I have been greatly enlightened and encouraged by the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders. I fully agree with and support these reports.

I am very pleased to see that the rebellion in Tibet has been quickly quelled. The Tibetan people will gradually be freed from their backward and dark lives and embark on the bright path of happiness and prosperity of socialism, just like all the other ethnic groups in the country. This armed rebellion by a section of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, betraying the motherland, was instigated and planned by Indian expansionists. We want to solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists: The Chinese people do not want an inch of foreign land, but we will never allow a single inch of Chinese land to be taken away by foreigners. If they do not pull back from the brink, the six hundred million Chinese people who have stood up are not so easy to bully.

Now I will talk about how our factory, driven by the principle of "taking steel as the key link," has vigorously developed local methods for generating electricity. Our factory is a textile and dyeing factory. In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant light of the General Line, all aspects of our factory's work have made great achievements. While overfulfilling the textile production plan, we resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of "taking steel as the key link" and the instruction of the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously produce steel. We not only vigorously produced steel (producing a total of 2,437 tons of iron in the second half of last year, completing 190% of the state plan), but also vigorously developed local methods for generating electricity, solving the difficulty of insufficient power. Due to the increased textile tasks, the power supply was originally insufficient, and sometimes shifts were rotated to stop work. After the all-people steel production campaign, taking steel as the key link, drove the overall leap forward in industrial production, the problem of insufficient power in our factory became even more serious. Solving the power problem became the central link in ensuring a comprehensive leap forward. At this time, the Party put forward the call for all the people to generate electricity, asking us to adopt the "small, local, and mass" approach to solve the difficulty of insufficient power through self-reliance. We believe that this instruction from the Party is very wise and timely. At that time, our factory regarded this work as a political task, put it forward to all employees, and called on everyone to offer suggestions and ideas to solve this problem. At the same time, the factory established a core leadership team led by the secretary of the factory Party committee, with the participation of workers and technicians, to specifically lead this work.

At the beginning, the employees had many doubts in their minds, and there was a relatively widespread fear of difficulty. Some talked about "conditionalism," some said "there is no way to get involved," and "how can those who engage in textiles generate electricity?" Some also held "mysterious" views on generating electricity, believing that "generating electricity is technically complex and equipment is difficult," and so on. In response to these ideological situations, we first carried out ideological mobilization among all employees, explaining that the cotton harvest provides increased production tasks for the textile industry, and that the power shortage is not only related to the factory's leap forward plan, but also to the overall leap forward of the city's industry. We summarized the experience of the large-scale steel production campaign and used vivid examples for education. On this basis, with the theme of "power shortage, is it passive waiting? Or actively generating electricity to solve the problem?" we launched a mass debate among all factory employees. Through the debate, we improved the understanding of all employees, broke down superstitions, liberated thinking, everyone started working, and everyone offered suggestions. The mass movement to generate electricity using local methods was launched enthusiastically. In the most intense few days, some workers, in order to generate electricity as soon as possible, worked continuously for thirty or forty hours without rest. The leaders repeatedly mobilized them, but they said: "We will not leave the front line until we see the electricity generated."

After the ideological mobilization, the factory's employees put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals. Based on these suggestions, we sorted out the key points, identified the characteristics of the boiler's potential and the collective transmission of production equipment, and determined to focus on the power workshop, manufacturing local steam turbines and modifying motor generators and steam engines in three areas. Three teams were established, and leading cadres went to the workshops with tasks, worked with the workers to study and work together. From collecting materials to installation, after a day and night of hard work, the modified motor generator was successfully generated. After six days and nights of efforts, the first local steam turbine was successfully manufactured. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the employees and strengthened everyone's confidence. We immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the power workshop, laying the foundation for everyone in the factory to start working and vigorously developing local methods for generating electricity. In more than a month, we created the following five methods for generating electricity and power: First, using local steam turbines to drive motor generators; second, using local steam turbines to directly drive machines; third, using the gas from iron smelting furnaces to generate electricity (installing five locomotive boilers); fourth, using hydropower, using water turbines to drive generators; fifth, using wind power, using suction fans to generate electricity. In addition, non-production electricity consumption such as lighting was reduced. Through the above methods, a total of 537 kilowatts of electricity can be generated. Currently, we are repairing an old locomotive, preparing to use it to generate electricity. After the repair, it can generate 1,000 kilowatts. In this way, we can achieve self-sufficiency in electricity.

We have personally experienced from the great leap forward in industrial production last year that as long as we listen to the Party, rely on the employees, and follow the mass line, there is no task that cannot be completed and no difficulty that cannot be overcome. We not only vigorously produced steel and vigorously generated electricity, but also drove a great leap forward in textile production. Last year, the value, output, and quality plans of our factory all achieved "monthly red." The output value in the fourth quarter doubled compared to the first quarter, and the total output value completed the state plan forty days ahead of schedule.

Currently, the factory is deeply carrying out the mass movement of "four highs" and "four savings" centered on high output and high quality. We guarantee that we will work hard, practically, and skillfully, and launch a new production upsurge to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the production tasks assigned to us by the state, in order to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

　　济南仁丰纺织染厂大搞土法办电
    王美恭代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我听了周总理和各位首长的报告，受到了很大启发和鼓舞，我完全同意和拥护这些报告。
    我很高兴的看到西藏的叛乱迅速平息了，西藏人民从此将逐步摆脱落后的黑暗的生活，和全国各族人民一样走上幸福繁荣的社会主义光明大道。这次西藏一部分上层反动分子武装叛乱背叛祖国就是印度扩张主义分子唆使和策动的。我们要正告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子：中国人民不要任何外国一寸土地，但是中国一寸土地也绝不让外国抢走，如不悬崖勒马，站起来了的六亿中国人民不是那么好欺的。
    我现在讲一下我们厂是怎样在以钢为纲的带动下大搞土法办电的。我们厂是一个纺织染厂。在去年一年当中在党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，我们厂的各项工作都取得了很大成绩。在超额完成纺织生产计划的同时，坚决执行了党中央提出的以钢为纲的方针和全党全民大办钢铁的指示，我们不仅大搞了钢铁（去年下半年共生产铁二千四百三十七吨，完成国家计划的百分之一百九十），而且也大搞了土法办电，解决了电力不足的困难。由于纺织任务增加，电力原来就不够用，有时轮流停班停车，在以钢为纲全民大办钢铁，带动工业生产全面大跃进后，我们厂电力不足的情况就更加严重，解决动力问题成为当时能不能保证全面跃进的中心环节。就在这时，党提出了全民办电的号召，要我们采取“小土群”的方针，自力更生解决动力不足的困难。我们认为党的这一指示是十分英明和适时的。当时我们厂就把这一工作当作一项政治任务，向全体职工提出，号召大家献策献计，设法解决这一问题。同时，厂里由厂党委书记挂帅，工人、技术人员参加，成立了核心领导小组，来具体领导这一工作。
    事情开始时，职工同志在思想上存在着很多疑问，较为普遍的存在畏难情绪，有的大谈“条件论”，有的说“无法插手”，“搞纺织的那能办电”？也有的对办电存在着“神秘化”的观点，认为“办电技术复杂，设备困难”等等。针对这些思想情况，首先在全体职工同志中进行思想发动，说明棉花丰收，为纺织工业提供了增产任务，电力紧张不仅关系到本厂的跃进计划，而且关系到全市工业全面跃进的问题。总结了大办钢铁的经验，以生动实例进行教育，在这个基础上以“电力紧张，是消极等待？还是积极的办电解决”为题，发动全厂职工大鸣、大放、大辩论，通过鸣放辩论，提高了全体职工的认识，破除了迷信，解放了思想，人人动手，个个献计，土法办电的群众运动就热火朝天的行动起来。在最紧张的几天，有的工人为了争取早日发电，曾连续工作三、四十个小时不休息，领导再三动员，但他们说：  “不见发电不下火线”。
    思想发动起来之后，全厂职工提出合理化建议一百多条，根据这些建议，进行窍门排队，排出锅炉有潜力、生产设备集体传动多的特点，确定以动力车间为重点，制造土汽轮机和改制马达发电及蒸汽机三个方面，成立了三个小组，领导干部随任务下车间，与工人共同研究，一齐干。从搜集材料到安装，经过了一昼夜的奋战，改制马达发电成功，经过六昼夜的努力，制造成功了第一台土汽轮机。这就大大鼓舞了职工的干劲，更加坚定了大家的信心。我们紧跟上召开了现场会议，推广了动力车间的经验，为在全厂人人动手，大搞土法办电打下了基础。在一个多月的时间内我们共创造了以下五种办电、办动力的办法：一、是用土汽轮机带动马达发电；二、是用土汽轮机直接带动机器；三、是利用炼铁炉的煤气发电（安装五部锅驼机）；四、是水力，利用水轮机带动发电机；五、是风力，利用吸风机发电。另外还压缩了照明等非生产用电。通过以上办法，共可发电五百三十七瓩。目前，我们正在修理一个旧机车，准备利用它来发电，修理好后，能发电一千瓩。这样我们就可以做到用电自给。
    我们从去年工业生产大跃进中亲身体会到，只要听党的话，依靠职工，走群众路线，没有完成不了的任务，没有克服不了的困难。我们不但大办了钢铁，大办了电力，同时还带动了纺织生产的大跃进。去年一年我厂的产值、产量和质量计划都达到了“月月红”。第四季度的产值比第一季度翻了一番，生产总值提前四十天完成了国家计划。
    现在全厂正在深入开展以高产高质为中心的“四高”“四省”的群众运动，我们保证一定要苦干、实干、巧干，掀起一个新的生产高潮，保证完成和超额完成国家给予我们的生产任务，来迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
