Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The joint statement of the All-China Youth Federation and the Japanese Youth and Women Delegation. The full text is as follows:

At the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation, the Japan-China Youth and Women Exchange Implementation Committee sent the second Japanese Youth and Women Delegation to China for a visit to the People's Republic of China in April 1959.

Since the first Japanese Youth and Women Delegation visited China in November 1956 and signed an agreement with the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the friendly relations between the youth and women of the two countries have made great progress. However, since May 1958, due to the Kishida Nobusuke government's disregard for the will of the Japanese people and its adoption of a blatant policy of antagonizing China, the exchange between the youth and women of the two countries has faced major obstacles.

The second Japanese Youth and Women Delegation visited China when Japan was vigorously carrying out a national movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations and abolish the Japan-US "Security Treaty". The purpose of the visit was to further deepen the friendship between the youth and women of China and Japan; to further promote the struggle of Japanese youth and women against the Kishida Cabinet's policy of antagonizing China and its war policy; to promote mutual support between the people and youth and women of the two countries in the struggle, and to contribute to the cause of peace.

The Japanese Youth and Women Delegation, led by Head of Delegation Sadao Utsunomiya, and others, held friendly talks with Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and others, and reached complete agreement on the following issues.

1.  US imperialism still occupies Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, and still occupies China's territory of Taiwan, and establishes military bases in Taiwan.

After discussing these facts, both sides confirmed that US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, the people of Asia, and the people of the world. The struggle of the people of the two countries against US imperialism is a common struggle against a common enemy.

2.  Both sides agreed that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China and opposed the Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" by following US imperialism. In the friendly exchanges between Japanese youth and women and Chinese youth and women, any conspiracy to create "two Chinas" should also be opposed.

3.  Both sides confirmed that the reason hindering the friendship and connection between the youth, women, and people of China and Japan lies in the Kishida Nobusuke Cabinet's policy of antagonizing China.

Both sides believe that no matter what obstruction the Kishida Cabinet carries out, the deep friendship already established between the youth and women of the two countries cannot be severed. Both sides support the joint statement of Zhang Xiruo and Inejiro Asanuma in March of this year.

4.  Both sides believe that in order to ensure peace in Asia and the world, it is extremely necessary to achieve the following points. To this end, the youth and women of the two countries must carry out struggles from their respective positions and support each other:

    1.  Realize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of Bandung.
    2.  Unconditional and comprehensive cessation of the testing, manufacturing, and stockpiling of all nuclear weapons;
    3.  Establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia and the Pacific region;
    4.  Countries in the Asian and Pacific region should conclude a collective security treaty.

5.  The Japanese Youth and Women Delegation pointed out that the Kishida Cabinet's policy of reviving Japanese militarism, revising the Japan-US "Security Treaty," and endangering peace in Asia and the world has been strongly opposed by the broad masses of the Japanese people and youth and women. Youth and women are standing at the forefront of this struggle. The All-China Youth Federation stated that the Chinese youth wholeheartedly support the just struggle carried out by the Japanese youth to abolish and oppose the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty."

Both sides believe that the forces opposing war and defending peace are growing day by day. Through this delegation's visit, the friendship between the youth and women of the two countries has been deepened. Both sides are convinced that the struggle of the people of the two countries, the youth and women of the two countries to defend peace will be further developed and victorious.

    我青联和日本青年与妇女代表团发表共同声明
    反对岸政府追随美国敌视中国
    两国青年与妇女在斗争中相互支持
    新华社4日讯　中华全国青年联合会和日本青年与妇女访华代表团的共同声明。全文如下：
    应中华全国青年联合会的邀请，日中青年与妇女交流实行委员会派出第二次日本青年与妇女访华代表团，于1959年4月访问了中华人民共和国。
    自从1956年11月第一次日本青年与妇女访华代表团访问中国、和中华全国民主青年联合会签订协议以来，两国青年与妇女之间的友好联系有了很大进展。但自1958年5月以后，由于岸信介政府不顾日本人民的意志，采取露骨地敌视中国的政策，使两国青年与妇女的交流面临着重大的障碍。
    当日本有力地开展恢复日中邦交、废除日美“安全条约”的国民运动的时候，第二次日本青年与妇女代表团到中国访问。访问的目的是为了进一步加深中日两国青年与妇女的友谊；进一步开展日本青年与妇女反对岸内阁采取敌视中国的政策和战争政策的斗争；促进两国人民和青年与妇女在斗争中的相互支持，为和平事业作出贡献。
    日本青年与妇女访华代表团宇都宫贞夫团长等十五人和中华全国青年联合会刘西元主席等人进行了友好的会谈，对下列问题取得完全一致的意见。
    一、美帝国主义现在还占领着冲绳、小笠原群岛，还霸占着中国领土台湾，并在台湾设立军事基地。
    双方讨论了这些事实后确认：美帝国主义是中日两国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民的共同敌人，两国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争是反对共同敌人的共同斗争。
    二、双方一致认为台湾是中华人民共和国的一部分，反对岸信介内阁追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。在日本青年与妇女对中国青年与妇女的友好往来中也要反对任何搞“两个中国”的阴谋。
    三、双方确认：阻碍中日两国青年、妇女和人民之间友好和联系的原因是在于岸信介内阁敌视中国的政策。
    双方认为：无论岸内阁进行任何阻挠，两国青年与妇女之间已结成的深厚的友谊是割不断的。双方都支持今年3月张奚若、浅沼稻次郎的共同声明。
    四、双方认为：为了确保亚洲和世界和平，实现下列各点是极其必要的。为此，两国青年与妇女要从各自的立场开展斗争，并且相互支持：
    1、实现和平共处五项原则及万隆十项原则。
    2、无条件的、全面的停止试验、制造，贮藏一切核武器；
    3、在亚洲和太平洋区域建立非核武器地区；
    4、亚洲及太平洋地区各国之间缔结集体安全条约。
    五、日本青年与妇女访华代表团指出：日本岸内阁复活日本军国主义、修改日美“安全条约”、危害亚洲和世界的和平的政策，已受到日本广大人民和青年、妇女的强烈反对，青年和妇女站在这个斗争的前列。中华全国青年联合会表明：中国青年衷心支持日本青年所开展的为废除和反对修改日美“安全条约”的正义斗争。
    双方认为：反对战争、保卫和平的力量在日益增长，通过这次代表团的访问，加深了两国青年与妇女的友谊；双方确信：两国人民、两国青年和妇女保卫和平的斗争将会得到进一步的发展和胜利。
