    Chongqing Machine Factory Rationally Arranges Time, Adopts Various Forms
    Combines Production Organization with Old Workers Learning Culture
    (Our Newspaper News) How to enable old workers who are very busy with production to regularly participate in learning and maintain their vigorous learning enthusiasm? The Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory has created a variety of effective teaching methods. More and more old workers are participating in regular learning, and their improvement is also quite rapid. Among the old workers under the age of 45 who can participate in learning throughout the factory, except for special circumstances, 95% have reached the level of senior elementary school or above.
    Some people in this factory originally believed that it was more difficult to organize old workers to study, and it was even more difficult to transfer old workers who master key processes or key technologies for the production of complex products to participate in learning. The factory party committee organized old workers to study in a planned way during the Great Leap Forward in production last year, and mobilized old workers to find many ways to create learning conditions. It further established a comprehensive responsibility system from the factory to the workshop, section, and production team that "grasps both production and education"; it held on-site meetings to introduce and promote the experiences of some workshops that organized employee learning better. Since the beginning of this year, it has further made comprehensive and rational arrangements for the learning of old workers. According to the characteristics of production, each workshop has adopted methods such as "less learning when busy, more learning when idle", "adjusting the middle shift (rotating old workers to work the middle shift and using the morning time to organize them to study)" and "learning after the shift" to arrange learning time for old workers. In terms of teaching forms, a variety of methods are adopted, such as combining centralized learning with decentralized learning, combining lectures with tutoring, combining classroom teaching with door-to-door teaching, and for mobile employees, taking books to the site for teaching. In this way, not only do general workers have better learning conditions, but every old worker also has the opportunity to learn. The tool workshop, because of the diversity and complexity of the products produced, some sections of the old workers must follow the shift to guide new workers in production, making learning difficult. The workshop arranges the learning of old workers in the relatively loose beginning of the month according to the production rules, and conducts collective classes in shifts; in the middle of the month, when production starts to become tight, they are dispersed for review. At the same time, this workshop also mobilizes cooperation based on the characteristics that sections are sometimes busy and sometimes idle, and mobilizes old masters to support each other, and draws out some old workers to concentrate on learning.
    In some workshops, door-to-door methods are used to help old workers solve difficulties in learning. The power workshop has few old workers, and production cannot be separated from the workshop. In the past, old workers were blank spots every time literacy campaigns or cultural studies were organized. Now, the workshop organizes teachers to the side of the boiler to teach during the short breaks after adding coal. After perseverance, the old workers in this workshop have also reached the level of senior elementary school. The blanking section of the tool workshop also adopted this method to teach old workers who could not participate in the workshop's spare-time school. This method is very popular among old workers.
    The workers in the supply and marketing section have greater mobility and often go to other places to purchase materials. They form the workers on ships or wooden boat teams into learning groups, equip each group with a worker with a higher level of education as a tutor, bring blackboards and chalk, and conduct teaching during ship rest or mooring. For workers logging in forest areas, they also use branches as pens and the ground as paper for teaching. When all these workers return to the factory, they are further guided by teachers of the spare-time school to improve. Many old workers in the supply and marketing section not only got rid of illiteracy using this method but also reached the level of senior elementary school.
    In order to closely integrate teaching with production, many teachers of the employee spare-time school and the workshop cultural school went to visit old workers and technicians to understand the learning requirements of old workers and collect the innovations and creations of advanced producers to supplement the teaching content. The geometry teacher learned that advanced producer Lin Qingfu and others used the principle of concentric circles to improve the "semi-automatic hinge grinding tap back angle fixture", and collected this innovation example into the geometry textbook to explain the principle of concentric circles, which the workers understood as soon as they heard it. Each workshop also enriched some calculation problems and application texts that are often used in production in the senior elementary school language, arithmetic and other teaching materials according to the needs of the workshop.
    The improvement of the cultural level of old workers has begun to play a role in promoting technological innovation and improving production. After fifty-five old workers in the Seventh Workshop got rid of illiteracy, they have put forward more than seventy technological innovations and rationalization proposals. Old worker Zou Yucheng used arithmetic division to improve the method of cutting lead wire after learning it, increasing work efficiency by more than 170 times. More and more workers are subscribing to newspapers and magazines, from which they have learned many good experiences and technologies. Zhao Changlin, an old worker in the machine tool workshop, saw in a foundry magazine that the model made of pebbles and dolomite crushed and mixed can withstand high temperatures, so he and another worker tried this method. As a result, the service life of the sand mold was extended. In the past, one sand mold could only be used once. Now, it can be used ten times.
    The old workers in this factory are becoming more and more enthusiastic about learning. A senior worker class was tried out last year, and another class has been added this year. (Attached picture)

    重庆机器厂合理安排时间采取多种形式
    结合生产组织老工人学文化
    本报讯　如何使生产很繁忙的老工人也能经常参加学习，保持旺盛的学习热情？重庆江陵机器厂创造了多种多样的有效教学办法。老工人参加经常学习的越来越多，提高得也相当快。全厂四十五岁以下能参加学习的老工人，除特殊情况外，95％都达到了高小水平或高小以上水平。
    这个厂原来有一些人认为组织老工人学习比较困难，抽调掌握关键工序或复杂产品生产关键技术的老工人参加学习更难。工厂党委在去年生产大跃进中同时有计划地组织老工人学习，发动老工人自己找出许多办法来创造学习条件，又进一步从工厂到车间、工段、生产小组，建立一竿子到底的“既抓生产、又抓教育”的全面负责制；召开现场会议，介绍和推广了组织职工学习较好的一些车间的经验。今年以来，又进一步对老工人的学习作了全面的合理安排。根据生产特点，各车间分别采取“忙时少学，闲时多学”，“调中班（把老工人轮流调作中班，利用上午时间组织他们学习）”及“班后学”等方法，为老工人安排学习时间。在教学形式上，采取了集中学与分散学相结合，讲课与辅导学习相结合，课堂上课与送上门教学相结合，流动职工采取带书到现场去教学等多种方法。这样，不仅使一般工人有了更好的学习条件，每一个老工人也都有机会学习了。工具车间，因为生产产品多样复杂，有些工段的老工人必须跟班指导新工人生产，学习有困难。车间就根据生产规律，把老工人学习安排在生产较松的月初，分班集体上课；到月中生产开始紧了就分散复习。同时，这个车间还根据工段与工段之间，有时忙闲也不一样的特点，发动协作，调动老师傅互相支援，抽出一部分老工人来集中学习。
    在一些车间，用送上门的办法帮助老工人解决学习上的困难。动力车间因为老工人少，生产不能离开车间，过去每次扫盲或组织文化学习，老工人都是空白点。现在，车间组织教师到锅炉旁，抽加煤以后的短暂休息时间进行教学，经过坚持，目前这个车间的老工人也都达到了高小水平。工具车间下料工段也采取这种办法，对不能参加车间业余学校学习的老工人进行教学。这种办法很受老工人的欢迎。
    供销科的工人流动性较大，经常到外地购料。他们就把轮船或木船队上的工人分别组成学习组，在每个组配备一个文化程度较高的工人作辅导员，带上黑板和粉笔，利用行船休息或停泊的时候，进行教学。对林区伐木的工人，也以树枝当笔、地皮当纸进行教学。所有这些工人回到厂里时，都由业余学校教师进一步指导他们提高。供销科许多老工人用这种办法不仅摘掉了文盲帽子，还达到了高小水平。
    为了使教学紧密结合生产，职工业余学校和车间文化学校的许多教员深入访问老工人和技术人员，了解老工人对学习要求，收集先进生产者的革新创造，补充教学内容。几何教师了解到先进生产者林庆福等运用同心圆原理改进“半自动铰磨丝攻后角夹具”，就把这个革新实例，收集到几何教材中，用来讲同心圆原理，工人一听就懂了。各车间还根据本车间的需要，在高小语文、算术等教材中充实了一些生产上经常要用的计算题和应用文等材料。
    老工人文化水平提高，对促进技术革新，提高生产，已开始发挥作用。七车间五十五个老工人摆脱文盲状态后，已提出七十多项技术革新和合理化建议。老工人邹玉成学习算术除法以后，用来改进剪铅丝的方法，提高工作效率一百七十多倍。工人们订阅报纸、杂志的人越来越多，从中学到了许多好经验和好技术。机床车间老工人赵昌林，看到翻砂杂志上介绍用鹅卵石和白云石捣碎混合做成的模型能耐高温，他就和另一个工人一道试用了这个方法。结果，使砂型的使用寿命延长了，做一个砂型，过去只用一次。现在，能用十次。
    这个工厂的老工人学习劲头越来越大，去年试办了一个老工人班，今年又增加了一个班。（附图片）
