    Sichuan Carefully Selects Fine Summer Harvest Crop Seeds
    Chengdu, May 20th (This newspaper) – While rushing to harvest and plant, various regions in Sichuan Province have launched a mass campaign to select and save seeds of wheat, rapeseed, peas, and broad beans in the fields. In addition to selecting and retaining existing fine varieties, regions are also selecting new and superior varieties. Besides selecting entire plots and blocks, they are especially mobilizing each commune member to select superior seeds from single plants and single ears.

    This year, in the summer harvest, Sichuan Province discovered some exceptionally well-growing wheat ears and rapeseed pods. For example, some wheat ears are more than four or five inches long; some wheat grains have fourteen or fifteen rows, with each ear reaching seventy or eighty grains, or even more than one hundred grains. Some also have particularly numerous branches, with strong stalks and long ears. These excellent and unique seeds are the result of the painstaking cultivation of the peasants, and people especially cherish them. However, some fine varieties are also deformed and degenerate during the growing process. Therefore, it is particularly important to seize the opportunity to do a good job in seed selection as early as possible. The Anyue County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting as early as mid-April to study and arrange the work of seed selection and retention. The production team leaders of each commune are responsible, and a seed selection work team was established to organize the elderly, women, and children to carry out the seed selection work. All selected seeds are required to be harvested separately, threshed separately, dried separately, and stored separately.

    In order to accelerate the speed of seed selection, many communes have also promoted the method of plot selection in the guidance fields and high-yield fields of wheat and rapeseed. The wheat and rapeseed with long ears, full grains, many pods, and high yields are retained as seeds in entire plots and blocks, and harvested and stored separately.

    In order to carefully select fine varieties, various regions have stipulated relatively strict quality and technical specifications. Wenjiang, Luzhou, Jiangjin and other special districts, in order to ensure the quality of varieties, have formulated a seed selection system of "five wants and five don'ts, three fixings and three prohibitions." The five wants are: want fine varieties, want main ears and large ears, want uniform growth, want full grains, want dense back seeds; the five don'ts are: don't want those near the edge of the field, don't want those with soil on their heads, don't want diseased and insect-infested plants, don't want those that are lodged, don't want small ears, etc. The three fixings and three prohibitions are: fix varieties, fix personnel for selection, fix threshing and drying grounds; prohibit mixing, prohibit mildew, prohibit insect infestation. These areas have also successively convened mass on-site seed selection meetings to impart seed selection techniques.

    At present, the masses in various regions have put forward the slogan "Seeds selected every year, yields increase year by year." They said that in addition to retaining sufficient fine seeds for their own use, they will also overfulfill the state-allocated fine seed task in order to support other regions. Now, fine varieties of wheat and rapeseed in Luzhou, Fushun and other places have been selected and put into storage. (Fan Qi)

    四川精选夏收作物良种
    本报成都20日电　四川省各地在抢收抢种的同时，展开了群众性的小麦、油菜和豌豆、葫豆的田间选种留种工作。各地除选留原有良种外，还选留新的优良品种；除成片成块选外，还特别发动每个社员选留单株单穗的优异种子。
    今年，四川省在夏收中，发现了一些生长特别好的麦穗和油菜荚，如有些麦穗长达四、五寸以上；有的麦粒有十四、五排，每穗达到七、八十粒甚至百粒以上，也有些是分枝特多，秆硬穗长。这些优良奇异的种子，都是农民千辛万苦精心培育的结果，人们对它们特别珍视。但是，也有一些良种在生长过程中变形变种，逐渐退化。因此，趁早抓紧选种工作就特别重要。中共安岳县委早在4月中旬就开会研究布置了选种留种工作，由各公社耕作区队长负责，成立了选种工作组，组织老年、妇女、儿童进行选种工作。对经过选留的各种种子，要求做到专收、专打、专晒、专贮。
    为加速选种速度，不少公社在小麦、油菜的指导田、高产田中还推行了片选的办法。把穗长、粒饱、荚多、产量高的小麦、油菜成片成块留种，单独收割打藏。
    为精选良种，各地都规定了比较严格的质量和技术规格。温江、泸州、江津等专区为了保证品种质量和他们制订了“五要五不要，三定三不准”的选种制度。五要是：要良种，要主穗、大穗，要生长整齐，要颗粒饱满，要背籽密；五不要是：不要地边的，不要土当头的、不要病虫株，不要倒伏的，不要小穗等。三定三不准是：定品种、定人选、定打晒场，不准混杂、不准霉变、不准生虫。这些地区并先后召开了群众性的选种现场会，传授了选种技术。
    目前，各地群众提出“种子年年选，产量节节高”的口号。他们表示除了留足自用的良种外，并且要超额完成国家分配的良种任务，以便支援外地。现在，泸州、富顺等地的良种小麦、油菜已经选好入仓。　（范畦）
