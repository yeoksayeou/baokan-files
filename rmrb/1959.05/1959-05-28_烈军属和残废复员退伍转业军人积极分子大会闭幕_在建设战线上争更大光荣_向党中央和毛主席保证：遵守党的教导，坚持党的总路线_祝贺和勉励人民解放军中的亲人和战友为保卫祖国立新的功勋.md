    Five Initiatives

    Dear Comrades, Revolutionary Martyrs' Dependents, Military Dependents, and Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel Across the Country:

    We are honored to be entrusted by you to come to Beijing and attend the National Conference of Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs' Dependents, Military Dependents, and Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel in Socialist Construction. At the conference, we reported on our work achievements, learned advanced experiences from each other, and more importantly, heard very valuable instructions from many central leaders. All of this has greatly educated and encouraged us. We deeply feel how eagerly the Party and the country expect from us, and how meticulously they care for us. Comrades! We must not fail the expectations of the Party and the country, and we must make more and greater contributions to the motherland in the future. To this end, we hereby put forward the following five initiatives to the comrades:

    1. Continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and become the most active and vigorous force in the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice thrift. In order to successfully complete the magnificent plan for national economic construction in 1959, the people of the whole country have launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice thrift. All of us, revolutionary martyrs' dependents, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel comrades, should fully devote ourselves to this movement and further play an active leading role in the movement. We must always maintain high morale and revolutionary drive on all fronts of socialist construction, strengthen our confidence in victory, and not bow to difficulties. We must not only be willing to work hard and practically, but also be good at working skillfully. We must use our brains, find tricks, study diligently, advance towards science and culture, and make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution in our different work positions, and do our best to improve labor productivity and work efficiency. We must be both heroes of hard work and practical work, and experts of skillful work.

    2. Love the people's communes and actively participate in the consolidation and construction of the people's communes. Revolutionary martyrs' dependents, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel in the people's communes should modelly implement the Party's principles and policies on the people's communes, actively work, care for the collective, cherish public property, and everyone become excellent commune members. Comrades who hold leadership positions in communes, teams, and groups should also implement the spirit of running communes diligently and thriftily, and democratically, and strive to run the people's communes well under the leadership of the Party.

    3. Be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and rashness, unite the masses, and advance together. "Modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." We must always remember this teaching of Chairman Mao. We should cherish the honor given to us by the Party and the people, not take credit, not be arrogant, not exaggerate the shortcomings of others, and not emphasize personal achievements. All things are done well, and achievements are the result of everyone's joint efforts. Without the masses, nothing can be done. We should humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, learn from the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and become one with the masses. We must strive to make achievements in production and work, and also do our best to help others make achievements.

    4. Continuously improve ideological awareness and carry forward the communist style. Prevent the intrusion of bourgeois ideology, and continue to carry forward the communist style of selflessness, benefiting the group, caring for the collective, and caring for the masses. Listen to the Party in everything, go wherever the Party points, and do whatever the Party tells us to do. Work selflessly and work meticulously and conscientiously. Tell the truth. Pay attention to current affairs and strive to learn the Party's policies. Always hold high the red flag of proletarian ideology and forge ahead courageously.

    5. Boost morale and defend the socialist construction of the motherland. We should continue to contribute our strength to consolidating national defense and safeguarding the unity of the motherland. Be vigilant and prevent the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage. Demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel comrades should actively participate in militia construction work and become the backbone of the militia. Revolutionary martyrs' dependents, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel comrades should maintain constant contact with relatives and comrades-in-arms in the army. Communicate with each other, encourage each other, and encourage them to make greater contributions in the glorious cause of defending the motherland.

    Dear comrades! We revolutionary martyrs' dependents, military dependents, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred military personnel resolutely guarantee to the Party: We will always listen to the Party, and together with the broad masses, muster greater effort, and use more brilliant achievements to present a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will continue to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and always stand at the forefront of the cause of revolution and national construction!

    All representatives of the National Conference of Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs' Dependents, Military Dependents, and Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel in Socialist Construction

    五项倡议
    亲爱的全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人同志们：
    我们光荣地受到你们的委托，来到北京，出席了全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会。在大会上汇报了我们的工作成绩，互相学习了先进经验，更重要的是听到了中央许多首长非常宝贵的指示。这一切都使我们受到很大的教育和鼓舞。我们深深地感觉到党和国家对我们的期望是多么殷切，对我们的关怀是多么无微不至。同志们！我们一定不要辜负党和国家对我们的期望，今后一定要为祖国做出更多更大的贡献。为此，我们特向同志们提出如下五条倡议：
    一、继续发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神，在全民增产节约运动中，成为最积极最活跃的力量。为了胜利地完成1959年国民经济建设的宏伟计划，全国人民已经掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。我们全体烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人同志，应当全力投入到这个运动中去，在运动中进一步发挥积极带头作用。我们要在社会主义建设的各个战线上永远保持昂扬的斗志和革命的干劲，坚定胜利信心，不向困难低头。我们不但要肯于苦干、实干，还要善于巧干，我们要在不同的劳动岗位上好好地动脑筋，找窍门，刻苦钻研，向科学文化进军，大闹技术革新和技术革命，为提高劳动生产率和工作效率而尽自己最大的努力。我们既要作苦干、实干的英雄，又要作巧干的能手。
    二、要热爱人民公社，积极地参加人民公社的巩固和建设工作。在人民公社内的烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人应当模范地执行党的关于人民公社的方针和政策，积极劳动，关心集体，爱护公共财产，人人成为优秀社员。担任社、队、组的领导职务的同志，还应当贯彻勤俭办社，民主办社的精神，在党的领导下努力把人民公社办好。
    三、谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，团结群众，共同前进。“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，我们要永远记住毛主席的这一教导。我们应当珍爱党和人民给予自己的荣誉，不居功，不骄傲，不夸大别人的缺点，不强调个人的成绩。一切事情办好了，有了成绩，都是大家共同努力的结果，离开了群众，任何事情也办不成。我们应当虚心听取群众的意见，向群众学习，和群众同甘共苦，打成一片。我们自己要在生产和工作中努力作出成绩，也要竭力帮助别人作出成绩。
    四、不断提高思想觉悟，发扬共产主义风格。防止资产阶级思想的侵袭，继续发扬大公无私、舍己为群、关心集体、关心群众的共产主义风格。处处听党的话，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，党叫干什么，就干什么。要忘我地劳动，细致踏实地工作。要说老实话。要关心时事，努力学习党的政策。永远高举无产阶级思想的红旗，奋勇前进。
    五、鼓舞士气，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。我们应当继续为巩固国防、维护祖国的统一贡献自己的力量。要提高警惕，防止敌人的阴谋破坏。复员、退伍、转业军人同志们应当积极参加民兵建设工作，成为民兵中的骨干分子。烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人同志应当和部队里的亲人和战友，保持经常不断的联系。互相通信，互相鼓舞，勉励他们在保卫祖国的光荣事业中作出更大的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们！我们烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人坚决向党保证：永远听党的话，和广大群众一起，鼓足更大的干劲，用更为辉煌的成就，向国庆十周年献礼。我们要在党和毛主席的领导下，继续发扬革命传统，永远站在革命和祖国建设事业的最前线！
    全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会全体代表
              1959年5月27日于北京
