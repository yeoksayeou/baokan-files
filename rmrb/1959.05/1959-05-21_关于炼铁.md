	About Iron Smelting
	Jiang Shenxiu
	In an iron and steel complex, there are three main metallurgical processes: iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling. Iron is smelted to make steel, and steel is made into steel products. Since iron smelting is the starting point of these three major metallurgical processes, the quantity and quality of iron production directly affect steelmaking and steel rolling. Therefore, in an iron and steel complex, iron smelting production occupies a very important position.
	The most easily seen thing when entering a steel factory is the towering iron smelting furnace. Because it is very tall, it is usually called a blast furnace; and because the blast furnace relies on blowing air (wind) into the furnace for smelting, it is also called a blast furnace. The smelting capacity of a blast furnace is indicated by the size of the furnace volume. Small blast furnaces have only a few cubic meters or tens of cubic meters, while large blast furnaces have hundreds of cubic meters or even more than a thousand cubic meters. Currently, it is generally believed that blast furnaces below 55 cubic meters are small blast furnaces, blast furnaces from 55 cubic meters to 200-300 cubic meters are medium-sized blast furnaces, and those above 200-300 cubic meters are large blast furnaces. The largest blast furnace in China is at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, with 1,513 cubic meters.
	Iron smelting is the process of smelting pig iron from iron ore. The main raw materials for iron smelting are iron ore, coke (or white coal), semi-coke, among which coke is most suitable for iron smelting, limestone (very small blast furnaces can use quicklime instead of limestone), and air. Iron ore usually contains iron oxides, and the process of turning iron oxides into iron is a reduction process. Reduction requires high temperature and reducing agents. Most of the coke is carbon, which can burn and generate heat to produce high temperatures, and the carbon itself and the carbon monoxide produced by the combustion of carbon are reducing agents, so they are essential for reduction. Carbon combustion requires a large amount of air. Usually, smelting one ton of pig iron requires two tons of iron ore, one ton of coke, more than half a ton of limestone, and about four tons of air. Therefore, air should be regarded as an important raw material. In addition to iron oxides, iron ore also contains impurities (waste rock), and coke also contains impurities (such as ash). Some flux (limestone) needs to be added to melt these impurities into slag and separate them from pig iron.
	A blast furnace is a cylindrical furnace that is smaller at both ends and larger in the middle. Its outer shell is usually surrounded by steel plates, and the inner wall is made of refractory bricks. The lower part of the furnace has several tuyere devices for blowing air into the furnace, and the bottom has an iron outlet and a slag outlet. The iron smelting process takes place inside the furnace. For blowing air, there must be a blower; in order to make the air blown into the furnace have a higher temperature, so as to increase the temperature inside the furnace and save coke, the blast furnace is also equipped with a hot blast stove.
	When the blast furnace is smelting, the amount of iron ore, coke, and limestone loaded into the furnace at one time is called a batch. The proportion of several raw materials in a batch should be calculated and determined according to the composition of the raw materials, the type of pig iron to be smelted, and the type of slag to be produced: this is called batching. The batched raw materials are loaded into the blast furnace batch by batch. At this time, the coke at the bottom of the furnace burns vigorously due to the air blown in, generating a large amount of gas. The gas comes into contact with the raw materials from top to bottom from the bottom up. This creates a series of changes in the furnace such as combustion, reduction, and slag formation. The smelted pig iron and the produced slag turn into liquid at the high temperature at the bottom of the furnace and flow to the bottom of the furnace. Since the specific gravity of the slag is much smaller than that of pig iron, the slag floats on top of the pig iron, naturally separating from the pig iron, and flowing out from the iron outlet and slag outlet at the bottom of the furnace, respectively. Iron smelting is a continuous production metallurgical process. Once production starts, it must continue to produce, blowing air and loading materials into the furnace day and night, and tapping iron and slag day and night.
	The product of the blast furnace—pig iron—is mostly iron, but some other elements, mainly carbon, silicon, manganese, sulfur, and phosphorus, enter the pig iron during smelting. There are two types of ordinary pig iron: one is used for the casting of machines and parts, called foundry pig iron. The other is used for steelmaking, called steelmaking pig iron. Because steelmaking furnaces include open-hearth furnaces, acidic converters, and alkaline converters, they have different requirements for the composition of pig iron.
	In addition, the blast furnace can also smelt some ferroalloys such as ferrosilicon and ferromanganese for the needs of steelmaking. These ferroalloys have very high silicon and manganese content. In order to smelt these pig irons with different compositions, the blast furnace must have corresponding batching and operating methods.
	Sulfur and phosphorus are harmful impurities in the composition of pig iron, especially sulfur is the most harmful. It can make the cast parts and the refined steel brittle. Therefore, when smelting in a blast furnace, raw materials with less sulfur are used as much as possible, and sulfur is driven into the slag when mastering the operation. However, sometimes it is still necessary to perform "external desulfurization" after the pig iron flows out of the blast furnace.
	How to evaluate the quality of blast furnace iron smelting? There are several main indicators of the blast furnace that can be used as the basis for evaluation. The most important are the utilization coefficient and the coke ratio. The utilization coefficient is a production indicator, referring to how many tons of pig iron are produced per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night. At present, the blast furnace of the No. 1 Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has the highest utilization coefficient among large and medium-sized blast furnaces in China, averaging 2.305 in April, which means that each cubic meter of blast furnace volume can produce 2.305 tons of pig iron per day and night. The coke ratio is mainly an economic indicator, referring to the amount of coke consumed to smelt one ton of pig iron. Generally, a blast furnace needs to consume 600 to 1,000 kilograms of coke to smelt one ton of pig iron. Blast furnace iron smelting has a quality inspection indicator—the pig iron qualification rate. The pig iron qualification rate of large and medium-sized blast furnaces is very high, generally reaching more than 99%. In addition, there is an important indicator in iron smelting—smelting intensity. The ways to increase the production of blast furnaces can be summarized into three: increasing the operating rate and extending the life of the furnace (increasing the actual production time), reducing the coke ratio, and increasing the smelting intensity. Increasing the smelting intensity is an important way to increase the production of blast furnaces. In fact, increasing the smelting intensity and increasing the air volume are the same meaning, because the smelting intensity is the number of tons of coke burned per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night, and in order to burn more coke, the air volume must be increased. The smelting intensity of large and medium-sized blast furnaces can reach 1.2 to 1.4, which means that each cubic meter of blast furnace volume can burn 1.2 to 1.4 tons of coke per day and night, while the smelting intensity of small blast furnaces can generally be higher. If more air is blown, more coke is burned, and more ore is smelted, more iron can be produced. However, this cannot be achieved by simply blowing more air. A series of measures must be taken in terms of raw materials and operation before the blast furnace can accept a larger air volume.

    关于炼铁
    蒋慎修
    钢铁联合企业中有三个主要冶金过程，即炼铁、炼钢和轧钢。炼出铁来炼钢，炼出钢来轧成钢材。由于炼铁是这三个主要冶金过程的起点，炼铁的产量大小和质量好坏直接影响着炼钢和轧钢，因此，在钢铁联合企业中炼铁生产占有很重要的地位。
    走进钢铁工厂最容易看到高高矗立着的炼铁炉。由于它很高，因此通常把它叫做高炉；又由于高炉是靠鼓风（空气）入炉进行冶炼的，因此又叫鼓风炉。高炉冶炼能力的大小是以炉子容积大小来表示。小型高炉只有几立方公尺或者几十立方公尺，大型高炉有几百立方公尺甚至一千多立方公尺。目前，一般认为，五十五立方公尺以下的高炉算小高炉，五十五立方公尺以上到二、三百立方公尺的高炉算中型高炉，二、三百立方公尺以上的就算大型高炉了。我国最大的高炉在鞍山钢铁公司，有一千五百一十三立方公尺。
    炼铁，就是从铁矿石中炼出生铁。炼铁原料主要是铁矿石、焦炭
  （或白煤）半焦，其中焦炭最适宜于炼铁、石灰石（很小的高炉可以用生石灰代替石灰石）和空气。铁矿石中通常含有铁的氧化物，把铁的氧化物变成铁的过程是还原过程。还原需要很高的温度和还原剂。焦炭中绝大部分是碳素，碳素能燃烧发热而产生高温，而碳素本身以及由碳素燃烧所产的一氧化碳又是还原剂，因此正是还原所必需的。碳素燃烧需要大量空气，通常炼一吨生铁需要二吨铁矿石、一吨焦炭、半吨多石灰石，而需要空气却达四吨左右，因此，应该把空气看成一种重要原料。铁矿石中除了铁的氧化物以外还有杂质（废石），焦炭中除了碳素以外也有杂质（如灰分）须要加入一些熔剂（石灰石），把这些杂质熔合成炉渣，与生铁分离。
    高炉是一个两头较小、中间较大的圆柱形炉子。它的外壳通常围以钢板，内壁由耐火砖砌成。炉子下部有几个鼓风入炉用的风口装置，底部有出铁口和出渣口。炼铁过程就在炉内进行。为了鼓风，要有鼓风机；为了使鼓入炉内的空气有较高的温度，以提高炉内温度，节省焦炭，高炉还配有热风炉。
    高炉进行冶炼时，一次装入炉内的铁矿石、焦炭、石灰石的数量称作一批料。一批料里面的几种原料的比例，要根据原料的成份、炼什么样的生铁和造成什么样的炉渣加以计算决定：这就是配料。配好的原料一批一批地装入高炉。这时炉子下部的焦炭由于鼓入空气而旺盛燃烧起来，发生大量煤气。煤气自下而上与自上而下的原料互相接触。这样便在炉内产生燃烧、还原、造渣等一系列变化。炼出的生铁和造成的炉渣在炉内高温下部变成液体流到炉子底部。由于炉渣的比重比生铁小得多，所以炉渣浮在生铁上面，自然与生铁分开，分别从炉子底部的出铁口、出渣口流出来。炼铁是个连续生产的冶金过程，一旦开始生产以后，就要继续不断地生产下去，日夜不断地鼓风、装料入炉，日夜不断地出铁、出渣。
    高炉的产品——生铁中绝大部分是铁，但在冶炼中还有一些其他元素，主要是碳、矽、锰、硫、磷等进入生铁。普通生铁有两种，一种生铁用于机器、零件的铸造，叫铸造生铁。另一种用于炼钢，叫炼钢生铁。由于炼钢炉有平炉、酸性转炉、碱性转炉等，它们对于生铁的成份有不同的要求。
    此外，高炉还能为炼钢的需要冶炼一部分铁合金如矽铁、锰铁。这些铁合金中矽、锰的含量很高。高炉为了冶炼这些成份不相同的生铁，就要有相应的配料和操作方法。
    生铁的成份中硫、磷是有害杂质，特别是硫为害最大，它能使铸成的机件和炼成的钢发脆，因此在高炉冶炼时，尽量用含硫较少的原料，并在掌握操作时把硫赶到炉渣中去，但有时还不得不在生铁流出高炉后再进行“炉外脱硫”。
    如何评价高炉炼铁情况的好坏呢？高炉有几项主要指标可以作为评价的依据。其中最主要的是利用系数和焦比。利用系数是个产量指标，指高炉容积每一立方公尺每昼夜出多少吨生铁。目前我国大中型高炉中以本溪钢铁公司第一钢铁厂的高炉的利用系数最高，4月份平均达到2.305，就是高炉容积每一立方公尺每昼夜能出2.305吨生铁。焦比主要是经济指标，指冶炼每一吨生铁所消耗焦炭的数量。一般高炉每炼一吨生铁需消耗焦炭六百到一千公斤。高炉炼铁有一个检验质量的指标——生铁合格率。大中型高炉的生铁合格率很高，一般都能达到99％以上。此外，在炼铁中还有一个重要的指标——冶炼强度。高炉增产的途径概括起来不外乎三个：即提高作业率和延长炉子寿命（增加实际生产时间）、降低焦比、提高冶炼强度。而提高冶炼强度是高炉增产的重要途径。实际上，提高冶炼强度和鼓足风量的意义是相同的，因为冶炼强度就是高炉容积每一立方公尺每昼夜燃烧焦炭的吨数，而为了多烧焦炭，必须鼓足风量。大中型高炉冶炼强度可以达到一点二到一点四，这就是说，高炉容积每立方公尺每昼夜能燃烧一点二到一点四吨焦炭，而小高炉的冶炼强度一般还可以高一些。鼓风鼓得多，焦炭烧得多，矿石熔炼得多，就可以多出铁。但这不是单靠多鼓风就能达到目的的，必须在原料和操作上采取一系列措施，高炉才能接受较大的风量。
