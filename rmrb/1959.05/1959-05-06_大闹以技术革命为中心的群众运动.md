　　I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. We will certainly mobilize the people of Nanjing to continuously strive for progress and struggle to fulfill the tasks assigned to Nanjing by the state.
　　1958 was a year of overall great leap forward in China's national economy. In this year, Nanjing, like other fraternal cities, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government at higher levels, resolutely implemented the general line of socialist construction and a whole set of policies of walking on two legs, breaking down superstitions, emancipating the mind, vigorously engaging in technical revolution, and launching a vigorous mass movement for high industrial output, achieving a great victory in the great leap forward of industrial production. The city's total industrial output value reached 1.93 billion yuan, an increase of 141 percent over 1957, accounting for 70 percent of the total output value during the first five-year plan period, and 38 times higher than the early days of liberation. The basic construction investment completed was 217 million yuan, an increase of 67.3 percent over 1957, exceeding half of the total investment during the first five-year plan period. More than 2,000 new products were successfully trial-produced, and labor productivity increased by 55 percent. Cost reductions and profit remittances also overfulfilled the state plan. The metallurgical industry has been established from scratch, laying a preliminary foundation. Now the city has seven small-scale iron and steel bases, and the medium-sized iron and steel complex—Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant—is also under construction and will be partially put into production in the first half of the year. Industries such as telecommunications instruments, chemical industry, light industry, and food industry have all developed exponentially. In particular, the manufacturing capacity of the machinery industry has been greatly strengthened, and it has begun to develop from small parts to large-scale complete sets. It is now capable of manufacturing important and complex products such as heavy-duty trucks, steam turbine generators, large motors, and complete sets of bearing equipment. These have provided very favorable conditions for achieving a greater leap forward this year. The high-speed development of industry has brought about fundamental changes in Nanjing's economic outlook, transforming it from a consumer city into a production city with a considerable level.
　　Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of the rectification movement, the city's workers have launched a vigorous mass movement centered on technical revolution. At the beginning of the movement, the focus was on improving process equipment, improving operating methods, breaking through production quotas, and creating new records. Then, focusing on the current production needs, they fiercely attacked technical bottlenecks, and then carried out a full-scale revolution from process methods, machinery and equipment, and product structure. Over the past year, the technical revolution movement has achieved remarkable results, mainly in the following aspects:

　　Improving old equipment, breaking old design quotas, and increasing the production capacity of existing equipment
　　This is one of the main contents of the technical revolution since last year. According to the situation of more than 50 major factories and enterprises in the city, after improving old equipment and breaking design quotas, the production capacity has generally increased by 30% to 50%. In particular, automated and continuous production factories have benefited more from this. For example, Yongli Ning Factory, without basically increasing equipment, has taken technical measures to greatly increase the production capacity of major products such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and synthetic ammonia. Sulfuric acid has achieved "four becomes five" (that is, the design capacity of four systems has reached the production capacity of five systems), increasing from the highest daily output of 750 tons (design capacity of 650 tons) in the past to 1,020 tons. Dilute nitric acid reached a daily output of 147 tons, doubling the average daily output at the beginning of the year. China Cement Plant's No. 2 rotary kiln promoted the advanced experience of "three big and one fast" (big coal, big material, big wind and fast rotation speed), creating a new record of 25.5 tons per hour (design capacity of 6 tons per hour). In automated and continuous production factories, it is often more difficult to improve old equipment and break old design quotas than in other factories, and there are also more ideological obstacles. Some people always emphasize the characteristics of high pressure and high temperature, and regard the prescribed design quotas as sacred and inviolable. Now people's minds are liberated, and they boldly conduct experiments, not only digging out great potential, but also making new achievements in technology.

　　Implementing the policy of comprehensive utilization and expanding the production of raw materials
　　According to the statistics of 16 municipal factories, a total of 236 satellite factories have been established. Producing steel, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, three acids and two bases, bricks, tiles, cement, chemical fertilizers, etc. Many of these products are made from waste gas, waste materials, and waste residue. Such as using slag to make cement, extracting alcohol from sawdust, and extracting certain rare metals from waste residue. Using carbon monoxide to process and manufacture methanol, formaldehyde, plastics, etc. Nanjing Meat United Processing Factory has made great efforts in poultry and livestock. In the first quarter of this year, it has used the skin, bones, hair, and internal organs of pigs and ducks to make more than 100 kinds of medicines and chemical raw materials, including cephalin, insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, liver injection, oxytocin, bilirubin, injection gelatin, and other more than 50 kinds of advanced medicines. Strive to achieve the leap forward target of "by-products exceeding cost, white meat net profit" within the year. Vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization can more fully and rationally use human, material and financial resources. At the same time, due to the implementation of one factory with multiple functions, one thing with multiple uses, and one person with multiple skills, the variety has greatly increased, and the technology has greatly improved.

　　Self-reliance, vigorously engaging in mechanical equipment to arm oneself
　　Last year, the city produced more than 5,000 metal cutting machine tools of various models. In addition, nearly 3,000 indigenous machine tools were designed and manufactured by themselves. Due to the addition of these indigenous equipment, especially the addition of some large-scale equipment, the production capacity of the machinery manufacturing industry has been significantly improved. It is estimated that in 1959, the cutting capacity and forging and casting capacity will increase by three to four times compared with 1958. Some of the indigenous machine tools produced are also high-grade products that are better than foreign ones. For example, the combined gantry milling machine designed and manufactured by the First Machinery Factory itself can process twenty-one processes on the machine tool bed surface at the same time. In the second half of the year, some factories used indigenous methods to manufacture complete sets of equipment. For example, Jinling Machinery Factory independently designed and manufactured a complete set of equipment for producing ball bearings in less than a month. This set of equipment has an annual output of one million bearings. Nanjing Wood Factory, through vigorously engaging in technical revolution, created 149 wooden machines, including sawing machines, planers, filing machines, grinders, scribing machines, automatic conveyors, etc., increasing production efficiency by ten to a hundred times. In 1958, without increasing labor, the total output increased fifteen times compared with 1957. Through the movement to arm ourselves, we have opened up a broad road for the development of the machinery industry.

　　Trial production of new products, promotion of new technologies, increasing product varieties and improving product quality
　　Among the more than 2,000 new products successfully trial-produced in the city, more than 300 are technically more advanced. Such as heavy-duty trucks, tractors, 800-kilowatt motors, 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine generators, 3,200-kilovolt-ampere transformers, 400 mm rolling mills, 60-channel carrier machines, 60 cm astronomical telescopes, aviation spark plugs, 1,200 high-grade cement, advanced electronic tubes, optical glass, etc., which had not been manufactured in the past, were successfully trial-produced in a short period of time. Due to the successful trial production of a large number of new products, the design and process level has been rapidly improved, and the technical force has been strengthened.

　　Improving tools, improving operations, and increasing labor productivity
　　The number of people participating in this type of technical innovation is the largest, and the economic effect is also the most significant, making technical revolution truly a broad mass movement. Since last year, the city's workers have successively contributed tens of millions of suggestions, and the total number adopted far exceeds the total number of rationalization proposals in the past nine years, sweeping away the cold and deserted situation of technical innovation. Through technical innovation, production efficiency has been significantly improved, more than 90% of production workers have broken through quotas, and a large number of production experts have emerged, including driller Yang Houfa, who completed 40 years of work in one year, and lathe operators Feng A'jin and Ni Yougen, who improved work efficiency by thousands of times. The mass technical revolution movement and the workers' ascent to the design stage have greatly improved the technical level of the workers, and a new and powerful technical force is growing and growing.
　　Launching a vigorous mass movement centered on technical revolution illustrates the following issues:
　　(1) Technical revolution is first and foremost an ideological revolution. Only by constantly fighting against various right-leaning conservative ideas and dogmatism and empiricism can we ensure that the technical revolution movement continues to move forward; and every achievement in the technical revolution movement promotes workers to further emancipate their minds and break down superstitions. For example, in the mass movement of vigorously engaging in indigenous equipment to arm ourselves, some people had great ideological resistance at the beginning and looked down on "small indigenous groups." Some said: "This is a regression to primitive society," and some said: "Indigenous machines can only be used for display and as exhibits," but after the vigorous mass movement, the vast number of workers adopted methods such as using small to attack big, using indigenous to attack foreign, "ants gnawing bones" and "teapots cooking pig heads" to design and manufacture many large and precise mechanical equipment, they were convinced and vigorously engaged in indigenous equipment. Workers' participation in design is a process of blooming flowers and bringing forth new ideas in the machinery industry. It not only manufactures many urgently needed equipment in production quickly, economically and efficiently, but also designs many "two highs and one simple" machines with simple structure, high precision and high efficiency, breaking the superstition that "precision equipment must be complex in structure" in machine manufacturing theory. In the past, some people thought that workers could only make improvements in technology, but now they believe that workers also have rich knowledge and unique insights in design work. After the workers participated in the design, they became more and more courageous, had more and more tricks, and even did things that they did not dare to think of in the past, and were more confident and determined to be the masters of technology. Leading cadres have also found specific ways to implement the mass line in leading technology and technical work. These will undoubtedly make the combination of theory and practice, technology and labor, and leadership and the masses have a more solid ideological foundation.
　　(2) Technical revolution must follow the mass line and vigorously engage in mass movements. It is the fundamental way to improve labor productivity and accelerate industrial development. However, some people still do not fully understand this issue. Their arguments are: "The movement disrupts the normal procedure and disrupts the balanced production," "The movement will affect product quality and safety," "Mass movements can be carried out in production management, but not in technical work," and so on. On the one hand, we carried out a great blooming, great contending, and great debate from top to bottom and from inside to outside, and adopted the method of presenting facts and reasoning to criticize these erroneous understandings. On the other hand, we organized high-yield movements and used practical examples to carry out education. Now, more and more people have realized the benefits of vigorously engaging in mass movements.
　　A large number of facts prove that to carry out technical revolution, we must vigorously engage in mass movements. To vigorously engage in mass movements, we must promote the methods of "one handover and four greats", "two participations, one reform, and three combinations". This is the most effective and powerful organizational measure to further improve the work style of cadres, strengthen enterprise management, and carry out technical revolution, and it is also a fundamental system for us to manage socialist enterprises. Implementing "one handover and four greats" means handing over tasks, difficulties, policies, and measures to the masses from beginning to end. We must listen to the opinions of the masses anytime and anywhere during the work process and consult with the masses in case of trouble. Through great blooming, great contending, and great debates, posting big-character posters, fully exposing contradictions, unifying understanding, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, mobilizing all positive factors, coming up with methods, and overcoming difficulties. Cadres' participation in labor should not only be institutionalized and regularized, and integrate with the masses, but also closely integrate participation in labor with leading mass movements and solving problems in enterprise management, and truly go deep into the masses to lead the masses, and go deep into production to lead production. Workers' participation in management should gradually achieve comprehensive participation in production, technology, and administrative management, and fully exert the infinite wisdom of the staff and workers, and strengthen their sense of honor and responsibility as masters in all aspects.
　　(3) Technical revolution must implement the combination of popularization and improvement, and the combination of indigenous methods and foreign methods, so that production technology can be developed comprehensively and at high speed, and technical innovation and technical revolution can truly become a mass movement. Many factories have achieved good results in implementing the combination of popularization and improvement, and the combination of indigenous methods and foreign methods in the technical revolution. Although indigenous production is generally more backward than foreign production, there are also some very advanced technologies in indigenous production, and it is not uncommon for indigenous to be better than foreign. For example, the automatic scale machine independently designed and manufactured by the workers of the First Machinery Factory has a simple structure and high precision. Li Jinzhang, an old worker of Jinling Machinery Factory, also designed and manufactured a ball rubbing machine using the principle of "rubbing yuanxiao", which also has good performance. It can be seen that all technologies are summarized from production practice. As long as we adhere to proceeding from reality and adhering to the mass line, a large number of small and ordinary creations will gradually converge into huge and amazing miracles. The problem is that the leadership must promptly discover the advanced sprouts in the masses, encourage, cultivate, and exchange them, and continuously improve and improve them. The masses have a good summary of the experience in this regard: "Poor doors are not afraid of being small, finding it is a treasure", "Use your brain, engage in innovation, the more you engage, the smarter you become".
　　(4) Technical revolution must be comprehensively planned and strengthened leadership. After the rectification movement, the communist consciousness of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly improved, and the revolutionary enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. Wherever the Party points, the masses will go there. This is a favorable condition for carrying out the technical revolution. However, the enthusiasm of the masses must also be well organized and guided in the right direction. This requires comprehensive planning and strengthened leadership. Our approach is: through the combination of leadership and the masses, repeatedly discussing production plans, in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the actual situation in production, formulating technical revolution outlines, as a period of struggle goals. Doing so can not only point out the direction and clarify the key points for the technical revolution, but also further strengthen management and make economic work more and more detailed. Establish a three-way combination of scientific and technological committees or similar organizations from top to bottom as an assistant to leading the technical revolution. Strengthen collaboration and exchange, factories, schools and research institutions cooperate closely with each other under a unified plan, learn from each other's strengths, and support each other to complete some major technical revolution projects and rapidly improve the technical level.
　　(5) The combination of technical revolution and cultural revolution, the cultural revolution in factories is carried out according to the requirements of the technical revolution and revolves around the great leap forward in production. With the development of the technical revolution movement, the cultural life of workers will inevitably become active. Technical innovations, especially the participation of workers in design, further increase workers' requirements for learning scientific and cultural knowledge. If the scientific and cultural knowledge of the vast number of workers, especially the old workers, cannot be improved, the further development of the technical revolution, especially the development towards scientific research and cutting-edge technology, will be very difficult. Some comrades oppose the two, thinking that it is currently only necessary to carry out the technical revolution, and the view that the cultural revolution can not be carried out is wrong. According to the statistics of 306 factories in the city, 107,000 workers participated in various schools and training classes, accounting for 47% of the total number of workers in these factories. However, because the study time for workers was not well arranged in the previous period, the spare time schools were not able to fully persist, and the number of students enrolled did not reach the due level. Recently, this situation has attracted the attention of the leadership, the study time has been guaranteed, and the number of students enrolled has also greatly increased.
　　The form of Red and Expert Schools created by the staff and workers is very popular. This school is a spare-time learning organization that unifies politics, culture, and technology, combines cadres, workers, and technicians, and revolves around production and closely serves production. The courses are compiled or adapted by themselves according to production needs and the order of learning. The teachers are in-service scientific and technical personnel and workers themselves. The teaching process is also a process of exchanging advanced experiences. The workers are very satisfied. They say: "In the past, blindly memorizing theoretical dogmas was boring. Now, theory is linked to practice, and it is easy to remember and understand."
　　Since the beginning of this year, because we have the experience of the great leap forward last year, we have been more consciously grasping it earlier and tighter, and the situation of the great leap forward in production has appeared earlier than last year by vigorously engaging in mass movements centered on technical revolution. The production tasks in the first quarter have been overfulfilled, and the total industrial output value has increased by 1.5 times compared with the same period last year, breaking the usual practice of low production in the first quarter. Facts have proved that as long as we follow the mass line, the production potential is still very large and can be explored endlessly. However, there are still many difficulties in fully completing the state plan this year, and there are many shortcomings in our work. We must continue to resolutely implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, implement a whole set of policies of "walking on two legs", vigorously carry out the nationwide movement of increasing production and practicing economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Combine vigorously engaging in mass movements with grasping production in a down-to-earth manner, continue to strive for progress, strive for upstream, do not let go of one move, do not relax one step, and push the mass technical revolution movement that has been formed to a new upsurge.

　　大闹以技术革命为中心的群众运动
　　彭冲代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。我们一定动员南京全市人民，不断鼓足干劲，为实现国家交给南京的任务而奋斗。
    一九五八年是我国国民经济全面大跃进的一年。这一年，南京市和各兄弟城市一样，在上级党和人民政府的领导下，坚决贯彻社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路的一整套方针，破除迷信，解放思想，大搞技术革命，开展轰轰烈烈的工业高产运动，取得了工业生产大跃进的很大胜利，全市工业总产值达到十九点三亿元，比一九五七年增长百分之一百四十一，为第一个五年计划期间产值总和的百分之七十，比解放初期增长三十八倍，基本建设投资完成二点一七亿元，比一九五七年增长百分之六十七点三，超过第一个五年计划期间投资总数的一半。试制成功的新产品二千余种，劳动生产率提高百分之五十五。成本降低和利润上缴也都超额地完成了国家计划。冶金工业从无到有，建立了初步基础。现在全市有七个小型钢铁基地，中型的钢铁联合企业——南京钢铁厂也正在加紧建设中，上半年即可部分投入生产。电讯仪表、化工、轻工、食品等工业，都有成倍地发展，特别是机械工业的制造能力已经大大加强，开始由小型配件向大型成套发展。现在已经能够负担起制造像载重汽车、汽轮发电机、大型电动机、全套轴承设备等重要而又复杂的产品。这些都为实现今年更大的跃进提供了十分有利的条件。工业的高速度发展，使南京的经济面貌发生了根本变化，已经由一个消费的城市转化为具有相当水平的生产城市。
    一年来，全市职工在党的领导下，在整风运动的基础上，开展了轰轰烈烈的以技术革命为中心的群众运动。运动开始时是着重改进工艺装置，改进操作方法，突破生产定额，创造新纪录。接着是围绕当前的生产需要，猛攻技术关键，进而从工艺方法、机器设备、产品结构等方面开展全线革命。一年来技术革命运动取得显著的成绩，主要有下列几方面：
　　改进旧设备，打破旧的设计定额，提高原有设备的生产能力
    这是去年以来开展技术革命的主要内容之一。从全市五十多个主要工厂企业单位的情况来看，经过改进旧设备，打破设计定额，生产能力一般都提高百分之三十至五十。特别是一些自动化、连续性生产的工厂在这方面的收效更大。例如永利宁厂，在基本上不增加设备的情况下，采取技术措施就使硫酸、硝酸、合成氨等主要产品的生产能力大大提高。硫酸实现了“四变五”（即四个系统的设计能力达到五个系统的生产能力），由过去最高日产量七百五十吨（设计能力六百五十吨）提高到一千零二十吨。稀硝酸达到了日产一百四十七吨，比年初平均日产量提高一倍。中国水泥厂二号旋窑推广了“三大一快”（煤大、料大、风大和加快转速）的先进经验，创造了台时产量二十五点五吨（设计能力台时产量六吨）的新纪录。在自动化、连续性生产的工厂中，要改进旧设备，打破旧的设计定额，往往比其他工厂有更多的困难，思想障碍也更大一些。有些人总是强调高压、高温的特点，把规定的设计定额看成是神圣不可侵犯的。现在人们的思想解放了，大胆进行试验，不仅挖掘出很大的潜力，也使技术上有了新的成就。
    贯彻综合利用的方针，扩大原材料的生产
    根据十六个市属工厂的统计，共办卫星厂二百三十六个。生产钢铁、有色金属、稀有金属、三酸二碱、砖瓦、水泥、化学肥料等。这些产品有许多是利用废气、废料、废渣制造出来的。如利用矿渣制造水泥，从木屑中提炼酒精，废渣中提炼某些稀有金属。利用一氧化碳加工制造甲醇、甲醛、塑料等等。南京肉类联合加工厂在禽畜身上大做文章，在今年第一季度内，已经利用猪、鸭的皮、骨、毛、内脏等制成医药、化工原料等一百余种，其中包括脑磷脂、胰岛素、促肾上腺皮质激素、肝注射液、催生素、胆红素、注射明胶等高级药品五十余种。争取在年内实现“副产超成本，白肉净利润”的跃进指标。大搞综合利用可以更加充分地、合理地使用人力、物力和财力。同时由于实行了一厂多能，一物多用，一人多艺，品种大大增加，技术大大提高。
　　自力更生，大搞机械设备武装自己
    去年全市生产各类有型号的金属切削机床五千多台。此外，又自行设计制造土机床近三千台。由于补充了这些土设备，特别是补充了一些大型的设备以后，机器制造业的生产能力有了显著提高。估计一九五九年的切削能力和锻铸能力都比一九五八年增加三倍至四倍。生产的土机床中有一些还是土中出洋而胜于洋的高级产品。例如第一机械厂自己设计制造的组合龙门铣，可以同时加工机床床面上的二十一道工序。下半年出现了一些厂用土办法上马制造成套设备。例如金陵机器厂在不到一个月的时间内，自行设计和制造生产滚珠轴承的全套设备，这套设备年产轴承一百万只。南京木器厂通过大闹技术革命，创制了一百四十九部木制机器，有锯床、刨床、锉床、磨床、划线机、自动传送带等，提高生产效率十倍到百倍以上。一九五八年在不增加劳动力的情况下，总产量比一九五七年增长十五倍。通过武装自己的运动，为机械工业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
　　试制新产品，推广新技术，增加产品品种和提高产品质量
    全市试制成功的二千余种新产品中，有三百多种是技术上比较高级的。例如载重汽车、拖拉机、八百瓩的电动机、一千五百瓩汽轮发电机、三千二百千伏安变压器、四百公厘轧钢机、六十路载波机、六十公分天文望远镜、航空火花塞、一千二百号高标水泥、高级的电子管、光学玻璃等，过去都没有制造过，是在短时期内试制成功的。由于大量新产品的试制成功，迅速地提高了设计和工艺水平，壮大了技术力量。
    改进工具、改进操作、提高劳动生产率
    参加这类技术革新的人数最多，经济效果也最显著，使技术革命真正成为广泛的群众运动。去年以来全市职工先后献计数千万条，采用的总数远远超过九年来合理化建议的总和，一扫技术革新冷冷清清的局面。通过技术革新，生产效率显著提高，百分之九十以上的生产工人突破定额，生产能手大批出现，其中有一年完成四十年工作量的钻工杨后发，提高工效几千倍的车工冯阿金、倪有根等。群众性的技术革命运动和工人登上设计舞台，大大提高了工人的技术水平，一支新的强大的技术队伍正在壮大和成长起来。
    开展以技术革命为中心的轰轰烈烈的群众运动说明下面几个问题：
    （一）技术革命首先是思想革命。只有不断和各种右倾保守思想和教条主义、经验主义作斗争，才能保证技术革命运动不断向前推进；而技术革命运动中的每一项成就，又推动职工进一步解放思想，破除迷信。例如在大搞土设备武装自己的群众运动中，开始有些人思想抵触很大，看不起“小土群”。有的说：“这是向原始社会倒退”，有的说：“土机器只能摆摆样子，当展览品”，但经过轰轰烈烈的群众运动，广大职工采取以小攻大，以土攻洋，“蚂蚁啃骨头”“茶壶煮猪头”等等办法设计和制造出许多大型的、精密的机械设备以后，他们才心悦诚服，大搞土设备。工人参加设计是机械工业中百花齐放、推陈出新的过程，它不仅多快好省地制造出许多生产中急用的设备，而且设计出不少结构简单而精度很高、效率很高的“两高一简”的机器，在机器制造理论上打破了“精密设备必然是结构复杂”的迷信。过去有些人以为工人只能在工艺上有改进，现在才相信在设计工作上工人也有丰富的知识和独到的见解。工人在参加设计以后，胆子越来越大，窍门越来越多，甚至做出连自己过去不敢想的事情，更有信心和决心去作技术的主人。领导干部也摸到了领导技术和技术工作中贯彻群众路线的具体办法。这些，无疑的会使理论和实践、技术和劳动、领导和群众的结合具有更坚实的思想基础。
    （二）技术革命要走群众路线，大搞群众运动，是提高劳动生产率加速工业发展的根本道路。但有些人对这一问题还认识不足。他们的论点是：“运动打乱了正常程序，打乱了均衡生产”、“运动会影响产品质量和安全”、“在生产管理方面能搞群众运动，技术工作方面不能搞”等等。我们一方面由上而下、由内而外，开展大鸣大放大辩论，采取摆事实、讲道理的办法，批判这些错误认识，一方面组织高产运动，以实际事例进行教育，现在已经有越来越多的人认识到大搞群众运动的好处。
    大量事实证明，开展技术革命，必须大搞群众运动。而大搞群众运动，必须推行“一交四大”“两参一改三结合”的方法，这是进一步改进干部作风、加强企业管理、开展技术革命的最有效、最有力的组织措施，也是我们管理社会主义企业的一项根本制度。贯彻“一交四大”，就是要把任务、困难、政策、措施一竿子到底地交给群众。要在工作过程中，随时随地倾听群众意见，遇事同群众商量。通过大鸣大放大辩论，贴大字报，充分暴露矛盾，统一认识，集中群众的智慧，调动一切积极因素，想出办法，克服困难。干部参加劳动，不仅要求做到制度化、经常化，和群众打成一片，而且应该把参加劳动与领导群众运动和解决企业管理上的问题紧密结合起来，真正做到深入到群众中去领导群众，深入到生产中去领导生产。工人参加管理，要逐步做到全面的参加生产、技术、行政管理，充分发挥职工群众的无限智慧，从各方面加强他们主人翁的光荣感和责任感。
    （三）技术革命必须贯彻普及与提高相结合、土法与洋法相结合，这样才能使生产技术得到全面和高速度的发展，也才能使技术革新、技术革命真正成为群众运动。不少厂在技术革命中贯彻普及与提高相结合，土法与洋法相结合的效果很好。尽管土法生产在一般情况下比洋法生产要落后一些，但是土法生产中也有一些很先进的技术，土中出洋或胜于洋不是罕见的。例如第一机械厂工人自行设计制造的自动刻度机，结构简单而精密度很高。金陵机器厂老工人李锦章利用“搓元宵”的原理设计制造滚珠的搓板机，也具有很好的性能。可见一切技术都是从生产实践中总结出来的，只要坚持从实际出发，坚持群众路线，大量的、细小的、平凡的创造就逐步汇合成为巨大的、惊人的奇迹。问题在于领导上要及时发现群众中先进的萌芽加以鼓励，培养，交流，不断改进，不断提高。群众总结这方面的经验说得好：“穷门不怕小，找到就是宝”，“动脑筋，搞革新，越搞越聪明”。
    （四）技术革命必须全面规划，加强领导。经过整风运动，广大群众的共产主义觉悟空前提高，革命积极性空前高涨，党指向那里，群众就奔向那里，这是开展技术革命的有利条件。但是群众的积极性还必须很好的组织起来，把它引导到正确的方向去。这就必须全面规划，加强领导。我们的做法是：通过领导和群众相结合，反复讨论生产规划，深入地、全面地了解生产中的实际情况，制订技术革命纲要，作为一个时期的奋斗目标。这样做，不仅可以为技术革命指出方向和明确关键，而且也可以进一步加强管理工作，使经济工作越做越细。建立从上而下的三结合形式的科学技术委员会或类似的组织，作为领导技术革命的助手。加强协作和交流，工厂、学校和研究机关相互之间在统一计划下密切配合，取长补短，互相支援，完成一些重大的技术革命的项目，把技术水平迅速的提高一步。
    （五）技术革命和文化革命相结合，工厂中的文化革命是根据技术革命的要求，围绕生产跃进开展起来的。随着技术革命运动的开展，职工中的文化生活也必然会活跃起来。技术上的革新，特别是工人参加设计，更进一步提高职工对学习科学文化知识的要求。如果广大职工，尤其是老工人的科学文化知识不能提高，技术革命的进一步发展，特别是向科学研究和尖端技术方面发展就有很大困难。有些同志把二者对立起来，以为目前只要开展技术革命，可以不开展文化革命的看法是错误的。据本市三百零六个厂统计，有十万七千工人参加各种学校和训练班学习，占这些厂职工总数的百分之四十七。但由于前一时期对于职工的学习时间没有安排好，业余学校没有能够完全坚持下来，入学的人数也没有达到应有的程度，最近这种状况已引起领导重视，学习时间有了保证，入学人数也大有增加。
    职工群众创造的红专学校的形式很受欢迎。这种学校是政治、文化、技术统一，干部、工人、技术人员三结合，围绕生产、紧密为生产服务的业余学习组织。课程是根据生产需要，和学习的顺序自行编订或改编的，教师是在职科技人员和工人自己担任的，教学的过程也是交流先进经验的过程。工人很满意，他们说：“过去死背理论教条，枯燥无味，现在理论联系实际，易记易懂。”
    今年以来，由于我们有了去年大跃进的经验，比较有意识地抓得早、抓得紧，大闹以技术革命为中心的群众运动，生产大跃进的形势比去年出现得更早。一季度的生产任务，已经超额完成，工业总产值比去年同期增长一点五倍，打破了历年来一季度低产的常规。事实证明，只要大走群众路线，生产潜力还是很大的，也是挖掘不完的。但是，要全面完成今年的国家计划，还是有不少困难的，在我们的工作中也存在不少缺点，我们一定要继续坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，贯彻“用两条腿走路”的一整套方针，大力开展全民的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。把轰轰烈烈搞运动和扎扎实实抓生产结合起来，不断鼓足干劲，力争上游，一着不让，一步不松，把已经形成的群众性的技术革命运动推向新的高涨。
