Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 24th. (Our Correspondent Zong Zidu) The Ula system (meaning corvée) in Tibetan serf society is like a bloodsucking viper coiled around the necks of Tibetan peasants and herdsmen, savagely draining the people's blood and sweat. Tibetan farmers and herdsmen have tasted the bitterness of the Ula system generation after generation.

The Tibetan feudal serf owners (namely, the government, monasteries, and nobles) imposed various complicated corvée labors and taxes on the serfs, which together are summarized in four characters: "Gang Zhuo Na Deng." "Gang Zhuo" literally means "walking with feet," figuratively meaning human and animal labor service; "Na Deng" literally means "offering with hands," figuratively meaning the food and property paid, and human and animal labor service, which is commonly referred to as Ula. There are many types of Ula, the main corvées being the free transportation of personnel and goods holding official "horse cards" (corvée requisition tokens) and providing food and lodging; undertaking all construction projects for the government and lords; and cultivating land and performing other odd jobs for the lords without compensation.

The Tibetan Kashag, Keqiao (equivalent to a commissioner's office), and Zong government (equivalent to a county government) and other power structures could issue "horse cards" for dispatching corvée. "Horse cards" are divided into long-term and short-term types, specifying the number of cattle and horses required and the number of people performing miscellaneous duties. Large serf owners, large government officials, and high-ranking monks all have long-term "horse cards" and can dispatch corvée at any time and place. Many official merchants also hold "horse cards" obtained through bribery, demanding that the people provide cattle and horses to transport their goods.

In the past, in Tibetan post stations and villages, one could often see scenes like this: as soon as officials holding "horse cards" arrived, the villagers had to quickly drop their work and busily clear rooms and move tables. The walls of the rooms for the officials were lined with cloth, and officials of medium rank or higher also had to install fringed canopies. Young women had to fetch water and boil tea to serve the officials. Each villager had to bring butter, beef, mutton, and eggs as gifts to the officials. Early the next morning, the villagers had to prepare horses for the officials. When the officials mounted their horses, because there were no mounting stones in the countryside, a serf would bend over and lie on the ground, allowing the official to step on his shoulder to mount the horse. Some officials asked farmers and herdsmen to use tea bricks as mounting stools, and after they mounted, the tea bricks would be looted by their attendants. If there was any slight negligence, the officials would scold, beat, and fine them.

Every year, Tibetan farmers and herdsmen had to expend enormous animal and human power to transport public grain, firewood, and grass for the former Tibetan local government, and those without livestock had to carry it on their backs. When large feudal nobles, high-ranking officials, and high-ranking monks traveled, they often required hundreds or thousands of people for corvée. Such corvée was called "Da Ula" (Great Ula). One such corvée often impoverished some corvée laborers, and some even died on the way.

The Tibetan army had the special privilege of dispatching corvée. Each person below the rank of Zubon (squad leader) could requisition one to three head of cattle; Xie-Ao (platoon leader) could requisition three horses and four head of cattle; Rubin (battalion commander) could requisition eight horses and twelve head of cattle; Daiben (regimental commander) could requisition twelve horses and twenty head of cattle. Each time the Tibetan army rotated or transferred, it was followed by a huge corvée team. When Tibetan soldiers with their own horses did not need that many corvée laborers, they would force the farmers and herdsmen to convert the prescribed number of corvée into cash payments and force the farmers and herdsmen to provide butter and highland barley to feed their own horses.

"Cattle and horse corvée" was a heavy chain on the poor Tibetan farmers and herdsmen. Families without horses also had to hire them with money to perform corvée. Officials always wrote more livestock on the "horse card" than they actually needed, for example, if only five horses and three cattle were actually needed, the "horse card" would state ten horses and ten cattle, and the surplus five horses and seven cattle would be given to the officials in exchange for cash. Officials rode the serfs' horses on the post roads, and the serfs who followed the horses had to follow closely behind, whether in freezing snow or high mountains and rapids, otherwise, they would never find their horses again. Farmers and herdsmen described this heavy burden as "no hair on the back of the cattle, no soles on the boots." Meaning, the heavy hauling wore out the hair on the backs of the cattle, and those who followed the cattle and horse corvée ran year after year, wearing through the soles of their leather boots.

The corvée that serfs performed for lords in the manors was also as numerous as hairs on an ox. Every spring, the serfs had to bring their plowing cattle and farm tools to cultivate the land for the lords without compensation first. At harvest time, the serfs could not harvest the crops on their "share land" until the lords' fields had been harvested. When serfs cultivated for the lords, some lords only gave them a small handful of rough, hard-to-swallow pea tsampa as food, and some did not even give them this. During the rainy season, the serfs had to repair the houses for the lords. There were no explicit regulations for performing corvée for feudal lords; whenever the lords had something to do, the serfs had to be at their beck and call. According to surveys in Qamdo, Lhasa, Bomi, Shannan, and other areas, the serfs spent more than one-half of their labor time in a year performing corvée for feudal lords. Generally, renting about ten Ke (one Ke of land is the land for sowing twenty-five Jin of seeds) of "share land" required one labor force to work in the lord's house all year round. In the suburbs of Lhasa, renting three or four Ke of "share land" required one year-round labor force.

Most of the labor services provided to the lords were non-productive, which greatly damaged the productivity of the rural and pastoral areas of Tibet and caused great hardship to the lives of the people. For example, Peng Cuo, a corvée laborer in Dengba Village, Bomi, had a family of two adults and four children, and originally cultivated six Ke of "share land." Peng Cuo's wife suffered from madness due to torture and could only be counted as half a labor force, and Peng Cuo had to perform corvée frequently and could not farm at home, so they mostly relied on borrowing to survive, and their debts accumulated to more than 500 Ke. Peng Cuo was forced to flee to Lhasa, and later his wife starved to death, and his four children became beggars.

When the serfs showed slight resistance or dissatisfaction with the dispatch of corvée, the serf owners would glare and scold, "Where there is a fire, won't the ground be scorched?" (Meaning, you cultivate my land, so you must listen to my orders).

In Tibet, serfs engaged in handicrafts also had to perform corvée for the lords, producing handicraft products without compensation. Zedang in the Shannan area is the best place in Tibet for weaving pulu fabrics. Under the Ula system, the people of Zedang, who possessed this good skill, were burdened with extra responsibilities. The former Tibetan local government, in the name of the Dalai Lama needing clothes, ordered them to weave dozens of rolls of "Zite" clothing material specially for the Dalai Lama every year. The old weaver Duo Ji Peng Cuo said: "How could the Dalai Lama wear so many clothes in a year? It's just that those reactionary officials secretly divided them up. The dyeing cost alone for one roll of 'Zite' clothing material is seven bottles of silver (one bottle is fifty taels), but the Kashag only gives two taels of silver for dyeing expenses, and they often nitpick about the color being bad and demand that it be reworked."

The Ula system was particularly painful for poor women. When the daughters of serfs reached the age of sixteen or seventeen, the lords would send their stewards to inspect them, and call the beautiful girls to the manor to perform corvée and serve the lords in miscellaneous duties. The lords would rape them at will, and after a few years, they would replace them with new ones.

The serfs were so squeezed by the Ula system that they could no longer live, and the only way out was to flee. There were many runaway households in the rural areas of Tibet. But the fleeing farmers and herdsmen only moved from one place to another, and no matter how they fled, they could not escape the clutches of the feudal serf owners. Farmers who fled from the government's corvée land fell into the hands of the nobles, and those who fled from the noble's manor fell into the hands of the government, or they became vagrants and beggars.

Now that the Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen are firmly demanding the abolition of the cruel Ula system. They say: We no longer want our shoulders to be used as mounting stools.

    铲除缠在脖子上吸血的毒蛇
    西藏农牧民要求废除乌拉制度
    新华社拉萨24日电　本社记者宗子度报道：西藏农奴社会的乌拉（意即差役）制度，就像缠在西藏农民和牧民脖子上的毒蛇，它凶残地吮吸着人民的血汗。西藏农牧民一代又一代地备尝乌拉制度的痛苦。
    西藏封建农奴主（即官家、寺院和贵族）把种种繁杂的差役和租税加在农奴身上，这些差役和租税总起来有四个字，叫做“岗捉纳登”。所谓“岗捉”，直译是“用脚走的”，意译是人畜的劳役；所谓“纳登”，直译是“用手奉献的”，意译是缴纳的食粮财物、人畜的劳役，就是通常说的乌拉。乌拉名目繁多，主要的差役是无偿地运送持有官府“马牌”（支差的牌子）的人员和货物并供给食宿；为官府和领主作一切修建工程；为领主无代价地耕种土地和干其他杂活等。
    西藏噶厦、基巧（相当专员公署）和宗政府（相当县政府）等一套政权机构，都可以发出派差役的“马牌”。“马牌”分长期和短期两种，上面写着所需牛马的头数及服杂役的人数。大农奴主、大官家和高级僧侣都有长期的“马牌”，可以随时随地任意派差役。许多官商也拿着贿赂来的“马牌”，要人民出牛出马给他驮运货物。
    过去在西藏的驿站和乡村里，经常可以看到这样的情景：持有“马牌”的官吏一到，村民们就得赶快丢下手中的活计，忙着腾房屋，搬桌子。给官吏住的房间墙壁用布匹围起来，中等以上的官吏还要安装带花边的篷顶。年轻的妇女就得去背水烧茶，侍候官吏。各家村民都必须拿着酥油、牛羊肉和鸡蛋来给官吏送礼。第二天一早，村民就得给官吏备好马。官吏上马时，因乡下没有上马的石蹬，就由一个农奴弯下腰，伏在地上，让官吏用脚踩着他的肩膀上马。有的官吏叫农牧民用茶叶包给他当上马蹬，上马之后，茶叶包就被他的随从们掠走了。稍有不周，官吏就要打骂和罚款。
    西藏农牧民每年都要付出巨大的畜力和人力，为原西藏地方政府运送公粮、柴草等，没有牲畜就自己背着走。大封建贵族、大官家和高级僧侣外出时，常要成百上千的人支差。这样的差役，名叫“大乌拉”。派一次这样的差役，常常弄得有的差民倾家荡产，有的甚至累死途中。
    藏军都有派差役的特权。足本（班长）以下的每人支一至三头牛；协敖（排长）支三匹马、四头牛；如本（营长）支八匹马、十二头牛；代本（团长）支十二匹马、二十头牛。藏军每次换防或调动时，后面都跟随着一支庞大的差役队伍。自己带有马匹的藏军不需要那样多的差役时，他们就按规定的差役数目强迫农牧民折成现金偿付，并强迫农牧民拿酥油和青稞来喂养他们自带的马匹。
    “牛马差”是西藏贫苦农牧民的沉重锁链。没有马的人家，也得另外用钱去雇来当差。官吏外出总是在“马牌”上多写些牲畜，比如实际上只需要五匹马和三头牛，“马牌”上却写十匹马和十头牛，多余的五匹马和七头牛就要折价送给官吏。官吏们骑着农奴的马在驿道上奔驰，跟马的农奴无论是在冰天雪地里或高山激流间，都得紧紧跟在后面追赶，不然，就会再也找不着自己的马匹。农牧民形容这种沉重负担为“牛背无毛，靴子无底”。意思是说，繁重的驮运把牛背上的毛都磨光了，跟牛马差的人成年累月的奔跑，把皮靴的底也磨穿了。
    农奴在庄园里为领主支的差役也是多如牛毛。每年春耕季节，农奴们就得带上耕牛和农具，先给领主无代价地耕种土地。秋收时，领主的田里未开镰，农奴不能先收获“份地”上的庄稼。农奴给领主耕作，有的领主只给他们一小把粗糙难咽的豌豆?粑作为食物，有的连这样一点吃食也不给。到了雨季，农奴又得去给领主修整房屋。给封建领主支差役，没有明文的规定，只要领主有事，农奴必须随呼随到。据昌都、拉萨、波密、山南等地区调查，农奴为封建领主支差役，一年中要占去二分之一以上的劳动时间。一般租种十克（一克地就是播种二十五斤种子的土地）左右的“份地”，就要出一个劳动力，长年在领主家劳动。在拉萨郊区，租种三、四克“份地”就得出一个长年劳动力。
    给领主服劳役，大部分是从事非生产性的劳动，大大破坏了西藏农村和牧场的生产力，给人民的生活造成了极大的困苦。例如波密登巴村差民彭错全家是夫妇两人和四个孩子，原来种了六克“份地”。彭错的妻子因受折磨得了疯病，只能算半个劳动力，彭错又要经常服劳役，不能在家种地，因此他们大半靠借债度日，债务日积月累，达五百多克。彭错被迫无奈逃亡拉萨，后来妻子饿死，四个孩子当了乞丐。
    农奴们对于派差役稍有反抗和表示不满时，农奴主就会瞪着眼喝斥道：“烧火的地方，地皮难道不烧焦吗？”（意即你种我的地就得听我支配）
    在西藏，从事手工业的农奴也要为领主支差役，无偿地制作手工业产品。山南地区的泽当是全西藏织氆氇织得最好的地方，泽当人民具有这种好手艺，在乌拉制度下反而使他们增加了额外负担。原西藏地方政府以达赖喇嘛要穿衣服为名，勒令他们每年要织几十匹专给达赖喇嘛穿的“滋特”衣料。负责这件事的老织匠多吉彭错说：“达赖喇嘛一年那能穿这许多衣料，还不是那些反动官员私下瓜分了。一匹‘滋特’衣料光是染费就要七瓶银子（一瓶为五十两），而噶厦却只给二两银子的染费，还常常挑剔颜色不好，要重新翻工。”
    乌拉制度对贫苦妇女特别痛苦。农奴的姑娘长到十六七岁时，领主就派管家去察看，把漂亮的姑娘叫到庄园上去支差，为领主服杂役。领主任意奸污她们，过几年又另换新人。
    农奴们被乌拉制度压榨得实在生活不下去了，唯一的办法只有逃亡。西藏农村的逃亡户很多。但逃跑的农牧民只是从一个地方转到了另一个地方，逃来逃去总逃不出封建农奴主的统治的魔手。从官府的差地上逃走的农民落入了贵族的手中，从贵族庄园上逃走的又会落入官府的手里，要不就是流浪和乞讨。
    现在，西藏叛乱已经基本平息，广大农牧民坚决要求废除残酷的乌拉制度。他们说：我们的肩头再不愿当马蹬了。
