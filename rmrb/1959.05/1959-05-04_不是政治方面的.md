    “Not Political”
    Shu Nan
    "India's concern for Tibet is historical, emotional, and religious, and fundamentally not political." This is what Indian Prime Minister Nehru repeatedly stated at a press conference before arriving in Mussoorie on the 24th to meet with the Dalai Lama, who had been abducted by rebels. On April 27, he repeated these words in the Indian Lok Sabha.
    But what are the facts? In the past month or two, some Indian politicians, through many newspapers and news reports, have made a great fuss about our Tibet, starting with "sympathy" and "concern," and then "Tibetan independence" and "India and Tibet are mother and child," in lengthy articles, even openly insulting our head of state. Please, how much of this is "historical" and "religious"? What is this blatant clamor if not the most reactionary political conspiracy?
    Even from the report by the Press Trust of India about the meeting between Prime Minister Nehru and the Dalai Lama, what we see is not concern on "historical, emotional, and religious" grounds. What the Prime Minister cared about was whether the letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan were real or fake, and whether the Dalai Lama wanted to implement reforms in Tibet, issues like these. Please tell me, isn't this also politics?
    Mr. Nehru is a politician, and he certainly knows what politics is. If these many anti-China clamors and aggressive ambitions of these Indian politicians are "fundamentally not political," does he take the Chinese people for idiots?
    The Panchen Lama answered well. He said: "Recently, some arrogant people in India, taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion and the so-called Dalai Lama's statements, have attacked and slandered our great motherland, undermined the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, interfered in our internal affairs, advocated so-called 'Tibetan independence,' and incited anti-China sentiment. How can it be said that the words and deeds of these people do not belong to the political sphere?"
    He also said: "Some people who are so unconcerned about Buddhism in their own country are constantly talking about caring for Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan cultural relics. Isn't this very strange? We sincerely believe in religion, but we resolutely oppose anyone using the guise of religion to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Whether Tibetan or Indian, we should be vigilant against such people and not be fooled!"
    Let us see, between the two of them, whose words are more "just"!

    “不是政治方面的”
    舒楠
    “印度对西藏的关心是历史方面的、感情方面的和宗教方面的，而基本上不是政治方面的。”这是印度总理尼赫鲁24日到达穆索里同叛乱分子劫持下的达赖喇嘛会面以前，在记者招待会上一次再次讲到的。4月27日，他在印度人民院又讲到了这些话。
    但是事实是怎么样的呢？最近一、两个月来，印度一些政治家通过许多报纸和消息，对我国西藏大做其文章，始而是“同情”、“关心”，继而又是什么“西藏独立”、“印度和西藏是母子关系”，连篇累牍，甚至公然侮辱我国元首，请问，这里面又有多少是“历史”和“宗教”？这样赤裸裸的叫嚣，不是最反动的政治阴谋是什么？
    就从印度报业托辣斯关于尼赫鲁总理和达赖喇嘛会见的报道中，我们看到的也并不是什么“历史方面、感情方面和宗教方面”的关心，这位总理关心的也还是达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的几封信到底是真还是假，关心的是达赖喇嘛是否希望在西藏实行改革，诸如此类的问题。请问，难道这也不是政治么？
    尼赫鲁先生是一位政治家，他当然懂得政治是什么。如果说印度这些政治家的这许许多多的反华叫嚣和侵略野心，都“基本上不是政治方面的”，莫非他把中国人民都当成白痴了么？
    班禅大师回答的好。他说：“最近，印度有一些狂妄的人，利用西藏叛乱和所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，对我们伟大祖国进行攻击毁谤，破坏五项原则，干涉我国内政，鼓吹所谓‘西藏独立’，煽动反华情绪。像这些人的这些言行，怎么能说并不属于政治方面呢？”
    他又说：“有一些对自己国家的佛教如此不关心的人，偏偏口口声声关心西藏佛教和西藏文物，这不是很奇怪吗？我们虔诚地信仰宗教，但是坚决反对任何人借着宗教的幌子进行干涉别国内政的活动。无论西藏人或者印度人，都应该对于这种人提高警惕，不要上当！”
    让我们看看，他们两人的话，究竟是谁的更“公正”一些！
