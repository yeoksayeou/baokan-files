    Laying a Good Foundation for Further Development of Mass Military Sports Activities
    The People's Liberation Army Games Concludes with All Events Completed
    Shooting and Radio Communication Competitions Set 18 International Records
    All Competitions Set 50 National Records, 38 Athletes Reach Master of Sport Standard
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th – The Second Sports Games of the Chinese People's Liberation Army concluded today with the completion of all forty-four events. Preliminary statistics show that this year's Games saw a total of 18 international best performances achieved in shooting and radio communications competitions, involving 44 athletes/times and 2 team/times; in all competitions, 50 national best performances were achieved, involving 101 athletes/times and 6 team/times. The competition results of 38 athletes reached the Master of Sport standard, and 345 athletes reached the First-Class Athlete standard.

    The nearly 10,000 athletes participating in this Games improved their skills through competition, mutual learning, and exchange of experience, laying a good foundation for the further development of military sports training and mass sports activities in the future.

    This Games began on March 23, with competitions held in Wuhan, Nanjing, Pingliang, Wuxi, Kaifeng, Beijing and other places in phases and regions. As a result of the competition, a large number of athletes broke several international and national records and achieved good results. In the individual championship of the Games, Zhang Hong, a competitor from the General Headquarters, broke the world record of 566 rings set by Soviet shooter Yasinsky in the 1955 Bucharest European Shooting Championship with a score of 567 rings in the slow-fire pistol competition with a small-bore free pistol. In the military practical events, sixteen athletes broke the highest records of the military practical events at the 1st International Friendly Army Games held in Leipzig in 1958. Among them, Ren Cijian, a 21-year-old artillery squad leader from the Kunming troops, had the best score, with a total score of 2,648, exceeding the total score of 2,326 (converted according to the scoring method of this Games) created by Han Guishan, a Chinese athlete who won the first place in the first International Friendly Army Games, by 322 points. More than 630 male and female athletes from sixteen delegations participated in the eighteen shooting events. They not only broke the national records in the men's military rifle 300-meter 60-shot prone, kneeling, and standing shooting, large-caliber rifle 300-meter 40-shot kneeling shooting, small-bore free rifle 50-meter 40-shot standing shooting, and women's small-bore free rifle 50-meter and 100-meter 30-shot prone shooting with scores of 533 rings, 370 rings, 349 rings, and 580 rings respectively. Zhu Jiaxin of the Shenyang troops and Bai Aijin of the Nanjing troops also created the best national scores in the men's military pistol 25-meter 60-shot rapid-fire and women's military pistol 50-meter 60-shot slow-fire competitions with 564 rings and 468 rings respectively (these two events originally had no national records). The naval team, known as the "Sea Dragons," won first place in the armed swimming relay race. They swam the entire course with rifles on their backs in six minutes and 19.4 seconds, which was 46.2 seconds faster than the time of the Soviet athletes who won the first place in this event at the first International Friendly Army Games in Leipzig in 1958.

    The radio communication competition yielded even greater results. The final result of the competition was that out of the sixteen international competition records that appeared in the two International Radio Fast Receiving and Sending Friendship Competitions held in Czechoslovakia in 1956 and in China in 1958, all fourteen items were broken except for the women's handwritten code receiving and women's manual key code sending; among the eighteen national records, all sixteen items were refreshed except for the women's handwritten code receiving and women's code sending. A total of seventy-nine people broke the above records.

    Equestrian competitions, water sports events, and parachute jumping performances also created excellent results. All equestrian events broke the records of the first People's Liberation Army Games. Liu Yuhua, Shen Meizhen, Xu Guoan, Peng Guangyu and others broke national records in parachuting and gliding.

    The glorious achievements of these events directly related to military training show that the People's Liberation Army has made great progress in sports training since the first military games, and the troops' physical fitness, combat skills and combat effectiveness have been significantly enhanced.

    The competition in other sports events also achieved good results in this Games. Long-distance runner Huang Zhiyong broke the national records held by Su Wenren of 31 minutes 22.4 seconds for 10,000 meters and 15 minutes 0.2 seconds for 5,000 meters with times of 31 minutes 12.6 seconds, 14 minutes 57.2 seconds, and 8 minutes 41.2 seconds in the three long-distance races of 10,000 meters, 5,000 meters, and 3,000 meters respectively, and tied the national record of 8 minutes 41.2 seconds for 3,000 meters created by Fu Shenghai. Huang Zhiyong breaking two and tying one national records in three events in four consecutive days has become a popular story of the Games. In the weightlifting competition, Yang Zhaoquan, a 21-year-old flyweight athlete from the Lanzhou troops, broke the national record of 98.5 kg for the flyweight push held by Tao Lianlu with a push of 100.5 kg, and exceeded the new national record of 100 kg created by Chen Yongbo in March this year. Li Jiyuan, a 23-year-old athlete from the Kunming troops, broke his own national record of 96 kg for the flyweight snatch for the third time this year with a snatch of 98 kg. Peng Guofu, an athlete from the Wuhan troops, also broke the national record of 113 kg with a snatch of 115.5 kg. In the archery demonstration, eight male and female athletes broke the national records in various events of this sport in 1958.

    Other sports events such as track and field, cycling, gymnastics, swimming, acrobatics, aviation model, motorcycle cross-country, chess, fencing, etc., also mostly achieved good results.

    The six ball games that have been held since the opening of the Games have also been very exciting and intense, indicating that the level of ball games in the troops has greatly improved. The results of the competition are as follows: the football champion is the Shenyang troops team, and the runner-up is the Nanjing troops team. The Shenyang troops men's basketball team won the championship with seven wins in seven games. The young national men's basketball second-tier team, the Air Force team, defeated Nanjing and Beijing, two first-tier teams, and lost to Shenyang by only five points to win the runner-up. The General Headquarters women's basketball team won the championship with seven wins in seven games, and the runner-up was the Guangzhou troops team. The Guangzhou troops men's volleyball team won the championship with seven wins in seven games, and the runner-up was the Air Force. The General Headquarters women's volleyball team won the championship with seven wins in seven games, and the runner-up was the Nanjing troops team. The baseball champion was the Beijing troops, and the runner-up was the Navy team. The Navy won the championship in women's softball, and the Kunming troops finished second. The Navy team was the champion in water polo, and the Fuzhou troops were the runner-up.
