Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch from Taipei: Anti-American sentiment is growing among the people of Taiwan. In Taipei, Kaohsiung, and other places, incidents of the Taiwanese people resisting or punishing American aggressors, who have committed many evils, have been occurring frequently recently.

According to Taiwan newspapers, American soldiers often commit acts of violence and assault people, and molest women in various parts of Taiwan, causing great indignation among the Taiwanese residents. On the evening of April 26th, an American soldier named Styler broke into the Fa Yueh Ice Cream Parlor in Kaohsiung City, acting drunk and causing trouble, and molested two female customers in the store. Two male customers in the store immediately grabbed him and punched him hard several times. This American soldier then destroyed the store's utensils and merchandise. Hundreds of citizens passing by immediately surrounded the American soldier, who was trying to escape, and shouts of killing arose, making the situation very tense. Later, a large number of American military police and Chiang Kai-shek group police arrived and rescued the American soldier, who had been beaten bloody. The several citizens who beat the American soldier were quickly picked up by a patriotic taxi driver before the arrival of the American and Chiang military police and driven away from the scene, thus avoiding arrest.

The report said that an American military officer named Langeler in Taipei City abducted a young woman named Chen Xiuhua to Dagangpu in Kaohsiung City and took her to the Gao Rong Hostel where he raped her. Chen Xiuhua's husband, Zhang, is a student at the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Political University." On May 11th, he received a message from Chen Xiuhua asking for help. He went to the address to find her and was intimidated by this American military officer, who forcefully took another man's wife, with a gun. This aroused the indignation of many travelers, who surrounded Langeler, preventing him from committing violence and firing the gun. Later, the matter was brought to the Foreign Affairs Office of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Kaohsiung City Police Department. However, the Chiang gang police personnel did not dare to deal with the matter because the American military enjoyed "extraterritoriality" in Taiwan, allowing Langeler to go unpunished. Chen Xiuhua's husband, whose family happiness was destroyed by the American military officer, became mentally deranged due to severe mental stimulation. This incident has become widely circulated news in Taiwan recently. Taiwanese residents are indignant at the repeated crimes of American aggressors who seize other people's wives and drive people crazy. A few days after the Chen Xiuhua case, a body of an American soldier was found near Buoy No. 1 in Kaohsiung Harbor, having been killed and thrown into the sea. All American military institutions in Kaohsiung have since tightened security. The US military authorities in Taiwan have also demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek group arrest the Taiwanese patriot who killed the American soldier.

The report said that anti-American leaflets have appeared several times recently in Taipei and other places. On May 4th, an American military vehicle was driving in Taipei City when Taiwanese patriots, at some point, affixed a banner written in Chinese and English with the words "Americans Get Out" to the vehicle. As the American military vehicle passed by, citizens who saw the banner told each other about it and cheered. Later, American military police discovered the banner, intercepted the vehicle, and notified the American military personnel on board. They then tore off the banner in a state of panic amidst the laughter of the citizens.

The growing anti-American sentiment among the Taiwanese people has frightened the American aggressors. Recently, Smott, the commander of the US military in Taiwan, in order to ensure "security in military deployment," coerced the Chiang Kai-shek group into ordering the demolition of all civilian houses at the intersection of Zhongshan North Road Section 3 and Xinsheng North Road in Taipei City, claiming that these civilian houses were close to the headquarters of the US military in Taiwan and threatened the security of the US military headquarters in Taiwan. This evil act by the American aggressors, which created a no-man's land and forced thousands of people to become displaced, has caused great indignation among the citizens of Taipei. At present, the call for driving out the American aggressors and returning Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people of Taiwan.

### 痛惩美国侵略者  台湾发生多起反美事件

    痛惩美国侵略者
    台湾发生多起反美事件
    新华社23日讯　台北消息：台湾人民反美情绪日益高涨。在台北、高雄等地，最近不断发生台湾人民反抗或痛惩作恶多端的美国侵略人员的事件。
　　据台湾报纸透露，美国兽兵常常在台湾各地行凶打人，调戏妇女，引起台湾居民的极大愤慨。4月26日黄昏，有一个名叫斯泰莱的美国兵闯进高雄市发月冰果店装醉撒野，调戏店内两个女顾客，店内两个男顾客立刻抓着他狠狠地揍了几拳。这个美国兵竟把店中的器物商品捣毁。过路的几百名市民倾刻间就把这个企图逃走的美国兵包围起来，喊杀之声四起，情势十分紧张。后来大批美国宪兵和蒋介石集团的警察赶到，才把这个被打得鲜血淋淋的美国兵抢救回去。动手痛打美国兵的几个市民在美蒋军警到达前刻，有一个爱国的汽车司机赶忙把他们载上汽车逃离现场，因此没有被捕。
    消息说，美军军官郎格勒在台北市把年青妇女陈秀花拐骗到高雄市大港埔，带往高荣旅舍加以奸污。陈秀花的丈夫张某是蒋介石集团“政治大学”的学生。他在5月11日接到陈秀花求救的讯息，按址前往找寻，竟被这个强霸人妻的美军军官持枪恫吓，激起许多旅客的义愤，把郎格勒包围，他才不敢行凶开枪。后来双方闹上了蒋介石集团高雄市警察局外事室，蒋帮警察人员因美军在台湾享有“治外法权”，不敢加以处理，使郎格勒逍遥法外。被美国军官破坏了家庭幸福的陈秀花的丈夫因精神深受刺激而失常。这一事件已经成为台湾最近时期广泛流传的新闻。台湾居民对美国侵略人员屡次出现的这种占人妻子，迫人疯狂的罪行都愤愤不平。陈秀花案件发生几天以后，在高雄港一号浮筒附近发现一具美军士兵的尸体，是被人杀死后抛到海里去的。高雄各个美国军事机关因此加紧戒备。侵台美军当局还要求蒋介石集团缉捕杀死这个美国兵的台湾爱国者。
    消息说，在台北等地最近曾好几次出现反美传单。5月4日，一辆美国军车在台北市区内行驶，不知何时被台湾爱国者在车身贴上一幅用中英文书写的“美国人滚蛋”的标语。这部美军车辆驶过之处，市民看见了标语都奔走相告，纷纷叫好。后来被美国宪兵发觉截车通知车上美军人员，他们才狼狈地在市民哗笑声中把标语撕去。
    台湾人民反美绪情的日益增长，使美国侵略者感到惧怕。最近，侵台美军司令斯摩特为了“军事部署上的安全”，竟要挟逼迫蒋介石集团下令把台北市中山北路三段与新生北路交叉处的全部民房加以拆除，理由是这些民房接近侵台美军司令部，威胁了这个侵台美军总部的安全。美国侵略者这宗制造无人地带迫使几千人流离失所的罪恶勾当，使台北市民十分愤慨，目前要求赶走美国侵略者使台湾回到祖国怀抱的呼声，在台湾已经深入人心。
