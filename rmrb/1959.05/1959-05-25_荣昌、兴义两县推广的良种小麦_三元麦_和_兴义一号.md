Rongchang, Xingyi Counties Promote Improved Wheat Varieties
"Sanyuan Wheat" and "Xingyi No. 1"

    This newspaper reports A high-yielding, improved wheat variety, "Sanyuan Wheat," which can adapt to deep plowing, close planting, and other yield-increasing measures without lodging, has been successfully cultivated in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province. Currently, the people of the county are engaged in a rush harvest, and are carrying out a campaign to select and retain superior improved seeds.
    The improved wheat variety named "Sanyuan Wheat" was first discovered in the Nanda 2419 wheat field of Sanyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Wucheng Township, hence the name "Sanyuan Wheat." Its advantages are large ears, early maturity, and full grains. In 1955, Yu Zizhang, the head of Hongqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Wucheng Township, led cooperative members to use this seed to plant 6.5 mu for testing. That year, Nanda 2419 wheat was harmed by aphids, while Sanyuan Wheat grew particularly well. After maturity, Yu Zizhang carefully selected seeds. In 1957, 88 mu were planted, with an average yield of 427 jin per mu, an increase of 27.5% compared to Nanda 2419 wheat. The Rongchang County Party Committee immediately decided to adopt a method of multi-point testing and centralized breeding to gradually promote it. This year, all 3,800 mu of Sanyuan Wheat planted throughout the county have not lodged under the conditions of deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, and close planting. It is predicted that the average yield per mu will be 32.4% higher than ordinary improved wheat varieties. Hongqiao Brigade (formerly Hongqiao Cooperative) of Wucheng Management District, Anfu Commune, used Sanyuan Wheat seeds for 97% of its wheat this year, and the predicted yield will be more than double that of last year.
    According to the introduction, Sanyuan Wheat has the following characteristics: 1. The plant is short and strong, with large ears and many grains: generally 85 to 100 cm tall, with thick stems and dense internodes, ear length of 7 to 10 cm, 17 to 22 spikelets per ear, and an average of 3 to 5 grains per spikelet, with wheat grains 5 to 6 mm long; 2. Strong stalk, fertilizer-resistant, and strong lodging resistance. According to several years of testing, no lodging occurred with deep plowing and heavy fertilization; 3. Early maturity and strong resistance to black rust and aphids: Sanyuan Wheat has a growing period of generally more than 170 days, belonging to early-maturing varieties, sown between frost and the beginning of winter; due to its strong resistance, it is not easily affected by pests and diseases; 4. Thin husk, no awn: the wheat husk can be used as livestock feed after fermentation.
    At present, Rongchang has organized special seed selection teams, adopting a method of selecting before harvesting, setting off a high tide of rushing to select and harvest.

    This newspaper reports: In Pengzha People's Commune, Xingyi County, Guizhou, a type of wheat rarely seen in other places grows everywhere: long drooping ears, tall stalks, and no awns on top of the wheat ears, drooping down like heavy grain ears. In addition to high yield, this variety also has many advantages that other improved wheat varieties do not have: cold resistance, drought resistance, strong resistance to pests and diseases, and no lodging. It has now been named "Xingyi No. 1" wheat by the Xingyi County Party Committee.
    This new wheat variety was cultivated and propagated by peasant Yang Qifu from three wheat plants. In 1952, Yang Qifu planted a plot of wheat in his garden, and when it was budding and heading, he discovered three peculiar wheat plants growing in this plot: the stalks were more than a foot taller than other wheat, each wheat ear was more than five inches long, drooping heavily like grain ears. These three wheat plants matured more than ten days earlier than other wheat under his careful care, yielding a total of more than 270 grains.
    Yang Qifu stored these more than 270 wheat grains like pearls and jade. When sowing the following year, he mixed the seeds with tung oil, yang dust, and gunpowder, and selected a small plot of the best land to sow the seeds. After harvesting, he still stored and placed them separately. By 1955, he had received more than 120 jin of wheat.
    Since the district party committee decided to vigorously propagate this variety in 1955, it has bloomed and borne fruit throughout the commune this year. After several years of comparative tests, the use of this improved variety can increase the harvest by about two times compared to other improved wheat varieties.
    Why can this seed be high-yielding and have many excellent characteristics? Last year, the Xingyi County Party Committee sent technicians to help Yang Qifu find the reason: It turned out that the plot of wheat Yang Qifu planted in 1952 was mixed with two varieties, Xiaoyumai and Daduhuangmai. Xiaoyumai wheat ears have no awns, are long and drooping, but are not cold-resistant, and the grains are not full; Daduhuangmai wheat ears have awns, the grains are full, and are cold-resistant and drought-resistant, but the drooping ears are not long or large. After these two types of wheat are mixed and planted, natural hybridization combines the advantages and characteristics of the two varieties into a new variety. This new variety is adapted to the climate, soil, and other conditions of Pengzha Commune, this remote, cold, and high mountain area.
    With the help of technicians, as well as receiving praise from superiors and love from the masses, Yang Qifu's confidence and determination to advance towards agricultural science have been even more encouraged. Now, Yang Qifu has engaged in seed test fields for various crops, and is researching and cultivating other improved varieties.

    荣昌、兴义两县推广的良种小麦
    “三元麦”和“兴义一号”
    本报讯　一种能适应深耕、密植等增产措施、又不倒伏的小麦高产良种——“三元麦”，已在四川荣昌县培育成功。目前全县人民在抢收中，正开展选留优异良种的运动。
    命名为“三元麦”的小麦良种，最早是武城乡三元农业社在南大二四一九小麦田里发现的，所以叫做“三元麦”。它的优点是穗大、早熟、子粒饱满。1955年，武城乡虹桥农业社社长喻子章领导社员用这种种子种植了六点五亩作试验。这年，南大二四一九小麦受到蚜虫危害，而三元麦生长特别良好。成熟后，喻子章便精心地进行选种。1957年种植了八十八亩，平均亩产四百二十七斤，比南大二四一九小麦增产27.5％。中共荣昌县委当即决定，采取多点试验、集中繁殖的方法，逐步推广。今年全县种植的三千八百亩三元麦，在深耕、肥足、密植的条件下，全部没有倒伏，预测产量平均亩产比一般良种小麦能多产32.4％。安富公社武城管理区虹桥大队（即原虹桥社），今年97％的小麦都采用了三元麦种，预测将比去年增产一倍以上。
    根据介绍，三元麦有以下几个特点：一、植株矮壮，穗大、粒多：一般株高八十五至一百公分，茎粗壮，节间密，穗长七至十公分，每吊有十七至二十二个小穗，每小穗平均三至五粒，麦粒长五至六毫米；二、秆硬、耐肥、抗倒伏性强。据几年试验，实行深耕和多施肥料，均未倒伏；三、成熟早、抗黑穗病、蚜虫的能力强：三元麦生长期一般为一百七十多天，属于早熟品种，在霜降至立冬期间播种；由于抵抗力强，不易受病虫危害；四、麦壳薄、无芒：麦壳经过发酵，可以作牲畜饲料。
    目前，荣昌各地已组织了选种专业队，采取了先选后收的方法，掀起抢选抢收高潮。
    本报讯　贵州兴义县捧鲊人民公社，到处长着一种其他地方少见的小麦：吊吊长，秆秆高，麦穗顶上无芒，像谷穗一样沉甸甸的往下垂。这个品种除了产量高以外，还具有很多其他小麦良种所不及的优点：耐寒、抗旱、抗病虫害力强，不倒伏。现已被中共兴义县委命名为“兴义一号”小麦。
    这种小麦新品种，是庄稼汉杨启富由三株小麦培育繁殖起来的。1952年，杨启富在他家园子地里种了一块小麦，到含苞抽穗的时候，他发现这块地里长着三株奇特的小麦：麦秆比别的小麦高一尺多，每个麦穗足有五寸多长，像谷穗一样沉甸甸地低着头。这三株小麦在他精心护理下，比其他小麦提前十多天成熟，一共收得二百七十多粒。
    杨启富把这二百七十多粒小麦，像珍珠宝玉一样地贮藏起来。第二年下种时，他用桐油、阳尘和火药拌种，并选了一小块最好的土地把种播下去。收了以后，他仍然是单藏单放。到1955年他已收到一百二十多斤小麦。
    从1955年区委决定大力繁殖这个品种以来，今年已在全公社普遍开花结果。经过这几年的对比试验，使用这种良种，比其他小麦良种的收获量能增产二倍左右。
    为甚么这个种子能够高产和具有很多优良特性呢？去年，中共兴义县委曾派了技术人员，帮助杨启富找到了原因：原来，1952年杨启富种的那块小麦，混杂着小玉麦和大肚黄麦两个品种，小玉麦麦穗无芒，吊吊长，但不耐寒，子粒不饱满；大肚黄麦麦穗有芒，子粒饱满，耐寒、耐旱，但吊吊不长不大。这两种小麦混合种植，天然杂交后，综合了两个品种的优点和特性，成了一个新品种。这个新品种，适应于捧鲊公社这个边远高寒山区的气候、土质等条件。
    杨启富经过技术人员的帮助，以及受到上级的表扬和群众的爱戴，更加鼓舞了他向农业科学进军的信心和决心。现在，杨启富搞了各种作物的种子试验田，正研究和培育其他良种。
