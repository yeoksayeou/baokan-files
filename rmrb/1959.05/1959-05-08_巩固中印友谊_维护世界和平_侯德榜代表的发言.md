Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report; I also agree with the various reports made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

Recently, Tibetan rebels, supported by imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, openly launched an armed rebellion. The State Council of our country issued a clear order to quell the rebellion, which has now been quickly suppressed. This is something that people of all nationalities across the country unanimously support and are happy about. This is entirely our country's internal affair, but some expansionist elements in India, like the imperialists, are unhappy about it and are clamoring loudly, slandering and defaming our country, which is truly surprising and infuriating.

I am a Witness to Sino-Indian Friendship

I am a witness to Sino-Indian friendship and would like to express some opinions on this matter.

From 1942 to 1948, for six years, at the invitation of Indian industrialists, I went to India almost every year to help design alkali plants and modify technological processes. The alkali industry is an absolutely confidential industry in imperialist countries. Capitalists are extremely conservative about the alkali industry. They not only monopolize the market but also monopolize the technology. Industrial backward countries that want to develop their own alkali industry are subjected to their economic and technical obstruction in an attempt to prevent them from establishing their own alkali industry. In this way, imperialists can dump their goods, seize the market, and carry out economic aggression at will. I personally engaged in this alkali industry in old China for more than 30 years and deeply experienced the difficulties. Therefore, when assisting India in establishing its soda ash plant, I unreservedly did my best to support India in establishing this chemical industry with all my knowledge. Last year, a group of young engineers from a large Indian enterprise came to our country through the introduction of the Indian government to visit the Dalian and Tanggu alkali plants and requested to stay in the factory for a longer period of time for study. Our central government readily agreed. They not only got to visit the two plants but also stayed in the two alkali plants for two or three months each to study. This is absolutely impossible in imperialist countries, but we did this because we hope that India can also get rid of the colonial shackles economically and become a prosperous and happy country in Asia with a modern alkali industry. I use these facts to prove who is a friend of the Indian people.

From 1946 to 1948, the Indian people shouted the slogan "British Get Out of India!" When India gained independence, I, like all the Chinese people, felt very happy. In 1949, the new China was founded, and the imperialist forces were also driven out of China by us. Since then, the people of China and India have shattered the shackles of imperialism and become close and friendly. The prime ministers of the two countries jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These facts are not reconciled by the imperialists. The imperialists have been painstakingly trying to seize the opportunity to undermine the friendly unity of the billion people of China and India. This is something that people with insight have long understood and are strictly guarding against. However, the expansionist elements in India have brazenly interfered in our issue of quelling the Tibetan rebellion, saying "Tibetan independence," which is really infuriating!

The Indian expansionist elements clamor: "Tibet is an independent country." This statement is actually picking up the dregs left by British imperialists. Since the establishment of the "East India Company," British imperialists gradually invaded India, then used India as a springboard to invade Tibet, and fabricated this "Tibetan independence" statement as an excuse. The Tibetan ethnic group is only one of the ethnic groups in China, just as there are Persians in India. The Tibetan ethnic group is one ethnic group in China, just as the Persian or Hui ethnic group is one ethnic group in India, not an independent country. Many people in Tibet believe in Buddhism, just as many people in India believe in Brahmanism, and a small number of people (about 500,000) believe in Buddhism, and some people believe in Islam. Therefore, religious belief cannot be used as a basis for politically dividing different countries. Imperialists and Indian expansionist elements attempt to insist that "Tibet is an independent country" from the perspective of ethnicity or religion, which is completely unreasonable.

All Countries in the World Recognize that Tibet is Part of Chinese Territory

Tibet has a long history within the Chinese territory. As early as the Tang Dynasty, Tibet had close relations with China. Emperor Taizong of Tang married Princess Wencheng to Tubo King Songtsen Gampo. During the reign of Emperor Xianzong of the Yuan Dynasty, Tibet was already included in the Chinese territory. The "Da Qing Hui Dian" of the Qing Dynasty also stated that Tibet is Chinese territory. Today's Lhasa is the "Potala" in the Hui Dian, and Shigatse is the "Tashilhunpo" in the Hui Dian. The Fifth Dalai Lama was canonized by the central government at that time. Since then, each Dalai Lama has been "determined" by the central government at that time. The "Kasha" of the Tibetan local government was established under the decree of the Qing court. These historical facts all show that Tibet has been a part of China for more than 700 years. Therefore, all countries in the world cannot but recognize that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory.

Since the establishment of the "East India Company," British imperialism gradually occupied India as its colony. I now want to expose the ugly history of Britain's coveting Tibet after invading India. After occupying India, Britain infiltrated Tibet from the northwestern border of India. As early as the late nineteenth century, British imperialists invaded Tibet. In 1889, Britain used the excuse that the King of Sikkim fled to Tibet to send troops to Tibet. In 1890 and 1893, Britain twice forced Tibet to sign agreements. In 1904, because Tibet was unwilling to sign an agreement, the British army attacked Tibet and arrived in Lhasa. China (the Qing court) protested and demanded that Britain withdraw its troops; Britain then extorted 2.5 million rupees from the Qing court before it was willing to withdraw from Lhasa. Since then, British imperialists have continued to press on. In 1908, Britain threatened the Qing court again, demanding the signing of a trade treaty between Tibet and India, in an attempt to control the Tibetan economy through India. In 1911, Britain took advantage of China's Xinhai Revolution to instigate Tibetan reactionaries to rebel. In 1912, British imperialism attempted to send troops from India in an attempt to seize Tibet's sovereignty. The Chinese people shared the same hatred, but after the Xinhai Revolution, civil wars occurred frequently, and they were unable to resist the enemy, and only protested to Britain. During this period, British imperialists did everything possible to provoke relations between the Tibetan and Han people and between monks and laypeople, and sent exploration teams and special agents to penetrate Tibet, and sent Englishmen as English teachers for the Dalai Lama. Britain also used the excuse of protecting trade to station troops along the route from the Indian border to Lhasa, called "guards." Since then, British imperialism has used the colonial tactics of "divide and rule" from India to invade Tibet. Today, the liberated Chinese people will never allow imperialists to gain a foothold in Tibet, nor will they allow anyone to seize the remnants of imperialist aggression and interfere in China's internal affairs.

After the liberation of Tibet, although a small number of reactionaries continued to obstruct in various ways, thanks to the party's correct ethnic and religious policies, the vast number of Tibetan monks and laypeople were united. The people's awareness has been generally improved, and the remaining forces and influences of the imperialists have been gradually eliminated. Indian expansionist elements still harbor ulterior motives and vainly attempt to inherit the colonial policies of British imperialism, which must be abandoned by the people of China and India, because these residual colonialist concepts are incompatible with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between the two major Asian countries.

The Tibetan People are About to Embark on the Road to Happiness and Well-being

After the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, the Tibetan people will gradually get rid of serfdom and embark on the road to happiness and well-being. As a great neighboring country, the Indian people must also be very happy. Some interventionists sympathize with a small number of Tibetan reactionaries who rebel against the motherland and undermine unity. I believe that fair-minded people in India will uphold justice, refute the "Tibetan independence" fallacy, consolidate the friendly unity of the Chinese and Indian people, and jointly guard against the conspiracies of imperialists.

As for the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" in India, which was hijacked by rebels, the so-called "second statement" stated that it was "authorized" to be written by others. However, Indian foreign official Menon still argued that: "There is no doubt that the statement was written by the Dalai Lama." The contradiction in the statement is so obvious that it is difficult to conceal the truth, and it is not difficult to see the inside story. Moreover, the wording of the "Dalai Lama's statement" does not conform to the Tibetan customary writing style. Even according to English and American writing, using the third person's grammar is equivalent to the report of a third party. This also aptly illustrates that the "Dalai Lama's statement" was not written by the Dalai Lama himself.

Consolidate the Deep Friendship Between the People of China and India

I have worked in India for many years and know that the friendship between the people of China and India is profound, but the destruction of this friendship by a few interventionist elements in India is intolerable to the Chinese people and is not allowed by every fair-minded person in India. Today, Asian and African countries have awakened, and the interventionist elements' attempt to inherit the wrongdoings of British imperialists must be corrected; the imperialists' conspiracy to use this incident to provoke friendship between China and India must be exposed. The friendly unity of the Chinese and Indian people and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are important cornerstones for maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and must not be undermined. Our solemn refutation of foreign reactionaries is precisely to consolidate Sino-Indian friendship and safeguard peace. We believe that fair-minded people in India will also agree to do so.

### 巩固中印友谊  维护世界和平  侯德榜代表的发言

　　巩固中印友谊  维护世界和平
    侯德榜代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理所做的政府工作报告；也同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席所做的各项报告。
    最近西藏叛乱分子在帝国主义者与蒋介石匪帮的支持下，公然武装叛乱。经我国务院明令戡乱，现已很快平息。这是全国各民族人民一致拥护和感到高兴的事。这完全是我国的内政，但竟有印度一些扩张主义分子，也和帝国主义者一样，感到不高兴，而且大肆叫嚣，对我国进行诬蔑和诽谤，实在令人诧异和愤慨。
    我是中印友好的一个见证人
    我是中印友好的一个见证人，愿对此发表一些意见。
    我于一九四二至一九四八年的六年中，应印度工业家的邀请，几乎每年都去印度一次，帮助印度设计碱厂、修改工艺流程等技术工作。制碱工业在帝国主义国家中是个绝对保密的工业。资本家对制碱工业极端保守。他们不但垄断市场，并且垄断技术。工业落后的国家要发展自己的制碱工业，都遭受到他们从经济上和技术上的多方阻挠，企图使工业落后的国家不能建立自己的制碱工业。这样，帝国主义者便可倾销其商品，霸占市场，肆意经济侵略。我个人在旧中国从事这制碱工业三十余年，深深体验到此中困难。所以在协助印度建立其纯碱厂时，毫无保留地尽我所知，支援印度建立这化学工业。去年，有一批印度某大企业的青年工程师经印度政府介绍到我国来，要参观大连及塘沽两碱厂，并要求比较长期留厂学习。我中央政府慨然允许。他们不但得到两厂参观，并且留两个碱厂学习各二、三个月。这是在帝国主义国家中绝对办不到的事，而我们这样做，目的就是希望印度能在经济上也摆脱殖民地枷锁，成为一个亚洲富强康乐的有现代碱业的国家。我拿这些事实来证明谁是印度人民的朋友。
    在一九四六至一九四八年，印度人民高呼着“英国人由印度滚出去！”的口号。在印度取得独立时，我和全中国人民一样，感到非常高兴。一九四九年新中国成立了，帝国主义势力也被我们赶出中国。从此中印两国人民都粉碎了帝国主义枷锁，亲密友好。两国总理共同倡议了“和平共处”五项原则。这些事实对帝国主义者来讲，是他们所不甘心的。帝国主义者处心积虑要伺机来破坏这十亿的中印人民的友好团结。这是有识之士都早已洞悉而严加防范的。但印度的扩张主义分子竟在我平息西藏叛乱的问题上，蛮横干涉，说什么“西藏独立”，真是令人愤慨！
    印度扩张主义分子所叫嚷的：“西藏是个独立国家”。这种说法实是拾英帝国主义者的唾余。溯自“东印度公司”成立，英帝国主义者步步侵略印度后，即以印度为跳板，侵略西藏，就捏造这“西藏独立”说法为借口。藏族只是中国各民族中的一个民族，这正如印度国内有波斯族一样。藏族是中国的一民族，正如波斯族或回族是印度的一个民族，不是一个独立国家。西藏人民有很多人信仰佛教，这正如印度有很多人信仰婆罗门教，其中也有小部分人（约五十万人）信仰佛教，更有一部分人信仰伊斯兰教。故宗教信仰不能作为政治上划分为不同国家的依据。帝国主义者与印度扩张主义分子企图从民族上或宗教上来硬说“西藏是独立国家”，是毫无理由的。
    世界各国都承认西藏是中国领土的一部分
    西藏在中国版图内已有悠久历史。远在唐朝，西藏就与中国有密切关系。唐太宗以文成公主下嫁土鲁蕃王松赞干布。元朝宪宗时，西藏即已列在中国版图以内。清朝的“大清会典”也载明西藏是中国的领土。今日之拉萨即会典中的“布达拉”，日喀则即会典中的“札什伦布”。第五世达赖喇嘛系由当时的中央政府册封。以后每世“达赖”都由当时的中央政府“拈定”。西藏地方政府的“噶厦”就是奉清廷之旨设置的。这些历史事实都说明了西藏是中国版图的一部分已有七百年以上的历史。所以世界各国都不能不承认西藏是中国领土的一部分。
    英帝国主义自成立“东印度公司”开始，逐渐霸占了印度为其殖民地。我现要揭穿英国在侵占印度后，窥伺西藏的丑史。英国占印度后，就由印度西北边境渗入西藏。早在十九世纪后期，英帝国主义者即对西藏侵略。一八八九年英国借口哲孟雄王逃入西藏，就向西藏进兵。一八九○年及一八九三年英国两次来迫西藏签订协定。到了一九○四年，因西藏不愿再签协定，英军即进攻西藏，到达拉萨。中国（清廷）提出抗议要英国退兵；英国乃向清廷勒索二百五十万卢比，始肯退出拉萨。此后英帝国主义者咄咄继续进迫。一九○八年英国又威胁清廷，要求签定西藏与印度间的通商条约，妄图由印度控制西藏经济。一九一一年英国更乘中国辛亥革命之际，唆使西藏反动分子叛变。一九一二年英帝国主义更图由印度进军，妄图侵夺西藏主权。中国人民同深敌忾，但在辛亥革命以后，内战频仍，无力拒敌，仅仅向英国提出抗议。英帝国主义者在此期间，百般挑拨藏汉人民及僧俗间关系，并派遣探险队和特务分子深入西藏，又派英人为达赖喇嘛英文教员。英国更借保护通商为名，由印度边境至拉萨沿途驻扎军队，名曰“卫队”。从此英帝国主义从印度大肆“分而治之”的殖民伎俩，侵略西藏。今天解放了的中国人民决不容许帝国主义者在西藏立足，也决不容许任何人袭取帝国主义者的侵略唾余，干涉中国内政。
    西藏解放之后，虽然有小撮反动分子仍在多方阻挠，但由于党的正确的民族政策和宗教政策，团结了广大的西藏僧俗人民。人民的觉悟已普遍提高，帝国主义者的残余势力与其影响已逐被清除。印度扩张主义分子竟仍怀着不可告人的企图，妄想继承英帝国主义的殖民政策，那必为中印两国人民所唾弃，因为这些残余的殖民主义观念是与亚洲两大国间的“和平共处”五项原则不相容的。
    西藏人民即将走向康乐大道
    西藏叛乱平息后，西藏人民即将逐渐摆脱农奴生活，走向康乐的大道了。作为伟大邻邦的印度人民一定也是十分高兴的，乃有一些干涉主义者同情西藏一小撮叛乱祖国、破坏统一的反动分子。我相信公正的印度人士一定会伸张正义，驳斥“西藏独立”谰言，巩固中印人民友好团结，共同警惕帝国主义者的阴谋诡计。
    至于达赖喇嘛在印度被叛乱分子劫持中的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，既由所谓“第二次声明”，说是“授权”给他人写的。而印度外交官员梅农仍申辩说：“毫无疑问，声明是达赖喇嘛写的。”发言矛盾如此，真是欲盖弥彰，不难看出其中内幕。况且“达赖喇嘛的声明”的措词不符合藏人习惯的文体。即按英美文字，用第三人称的语法，也是等于第三者的报道。这也恰可说明，“达赖喇嘛的声明”不是由达赖喇嘛自己写的。
    巩固中印两国人民的深厚友情
    我曾在印度工作多年，深知中印两国人民友情深厚，而印度少数干涉主义分子破坏这种友谊，这是中国人民所不能容忍的，也是每一个印度的公正人士所不允许的。今日亚非国家都已觉醒了，干涉主义分子妄图继承英帝国主义者的错误行径必须纠正；帝国主义借这次事件来挑拨中印间友好的阴谋必须揭破。中印人民的友好团结和“和平共处”五项原则是维护亚洲和世界和平的重要基石，决不允许破坏。我们对外国反动派严正的驳斥，正是巩固中印友谊，维护和平。我们相信印度公正人士一定也会同意这样做的。
