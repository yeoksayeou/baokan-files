Comrades, Representatives:
    I fully endorse the reports by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am a forestry worker from Heilongjiang Province. I would like to briefly report to the congress on the tool reform situation in timber production in our province in 1958 and the first quarter of 1959, and I hope that the representatives will offer criticisms and suggestions.

    Heilongjiang Province has relatively abundant forest resources and is the largest timber production base in our country. Therefore, it undertakes a major task in supplying timber for the country's socialist construction. In recent years, the amount of timber produced in our province has accounted for about one-third of the total national timber output. In 1958 and 1959, with the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in national industrial and agricultural production and various socialist constructions, timber production tasks greatly increased. In 1958, timber production in our province increased by 50 percent compared to 1957, and the timber production task in 1959 increased by about 40 percent compared to the output in 1958. At first glance, the timber production tasks in these two years did not double, and it seems that it is not a significant leap forward. However, it should be known that timber production is different from other industrial and mining enterprises. Its production sites are in remote mountainous areas, and the products are very bulky, subject to the growth conditions of natural forests and seasonal restrictions. To increase timber production by so much in a year is a very big leap forward. In particular, due to the overall Great Leap Forward in the national economy, there is a tense situation of insufficient labor, equipment, and materials; the proportion of mechanized production in the original timber production enterprises is very low, and a large part of the timber task has to rely on a large number of people going up the mountain to complete it manually. This has brought great difficulties in completing the timber production task. This is also a key issue that must be resolved in the Great Leap Forward of timber production.

    There are two ways to solve this problem. One way is to vigorously carry out a technical revolution on the basis of existing and potentially obtainable mechanical equipment, launch a mass movement, and, according to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods and self-reliance, manufacture and promote various effective indigenous equipment and new tools in large quantities; at the same time, fully tap the potential of existing mechanical equipment and improve equipment utilization. The other way is to be pessimistic and negative in the face of difficulties, be a "hand-raiser" and "mouth-opener," completely relying on asking superiors for machinery and labor. If it cannot be obtained, then "it is difficult to complete the national task." This method is obviously not good. The former method is the way to exert all efforts, strive for the upstream, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We have adopted this method in production.

    Vigorously carrying out tool reform, reducing heavy physical labor, and realizing year-round operation have greatly increased timber production.

    In 1958 and the first quarter of 1959, under the attention and leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, we launched a mass movement centered on technical revolution and vigorously carried out the tool reform movement in timber production, achieving remarkable results. The over-fulfillment of the task of 10.04 million cubic meters of timber production in our province in 1958 and the great achievements in timber production in the first quarter of this year are inseparable from our achievements in this area. Many timber production enterprises have carried out the tool reform movement vigorously and dramatically, greatly changing the production outlook. The Tonghe Forestry Bureau is a relatively prominent example. Last year, in terms of technological innovation, this bureau adhered to the principles of indigenous first, then foreign; combining indigenous and foreign methods; self-reliance; and equipping themselves, vigorously mobilized the masses, and launched a large-scale mass movement for tool reform. After a year of hard work, it created and promoted more than 20 new timber extraction tools, such as wooden rail flatcars, wooden flatcars, wooden rail skidding, lightweight skidders, wooden chutes, earthen chutes, ice chutes, small-wheeled skidding carts, and simple aerial cableways, making almost all timber extraction processes use new tools; and eliminating "bone grinding" (relying entirely on physical strength to lift wood) in the storage yards. As a result, the proportion of year-round operation production in the bureau increased from 10 percent in 1957 to 72 percent, greatly changing the production outlook. In the second half of the year alone, 136 days were used to complete a timber extraction task of 237,000 cubic meters, and the average daily output increased from 1,150 cubic meters using horse-drawn slings in the past to 1,644 cubic meters, increasing efficiency by 30 percent. Especially in winter production, the masses created eight new tools suitable for winter timber extraction and laid more than 150 various slides, which showed even greater power, increasing the daily output of timber extraction to 2,300 cubic meters to 3,500 cubic meters. Due to the increased proportion of year-round operation, timber production has basically freed itself from seasonal restrictions, and can be carried out rhythmically throughout the year. The production cycle has also been shortened from 200 days in the past to 20 days. It has greatly reduced the heavy physical labor of workers, improved labor productivity, and reduced production costs. Therefore, the bureau not only completed the national timber production plan two months ahead of schedule in 1958, but also solved the difficulties of insufficient labor and machinery. Last winter, the bureau used 5,453 fewer farmers and more than 4,000 fewer livestock, not only resolving the contradiction of competing with agricultural production for time, labor, and livestock, but also saving more than 310,000 yuan in material reserves and transportation costs for grain, grass, and other materials. The workers of the Tonghe Forestry Bureau once used a poem to evaluate the achievements of the tool reform. They said: "New tools, really good, flying in the air, running on the ground, year-round operation is realized, timber production is greatly improved, new tools, really wonderful, light and convenient, economical, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, heavy labor is liberated." This fully demonstrates the workers' happy mood after eliminating "bone grinding" labor in production, and also shows that tool reform is not only a good way to achieve timber production plans, but also an urgent requirement of the majority of workers.

    Practice has proved that these new timber extraction tools have great advantages, mainly: taking materials locally, simple to manufacture, easy to operate, conducive to safety, making full use of natural conditions, conducive to forest renewal, suitable for high mountains and plains, suitable for all seasons, high efficiency, and low cost. Some new tools can also complete the work that existing machinery cannot currently do under certain conditions, and some new tools (such as lightweight skidders, small-wheeled skidding carts, etc.), after further development and improvement, and adding mechanical power, will become modern tools and machinery for forestry production. Vigorously developing new tools is indeed a good direction for the current tool reform of timber production. It should continue to develop and strive to improve. At present, the timber extraction with new tools has been greatly developed in our province's timber production. In the first quarter, 39 percent of the total timber extraction was completed by new tools. It is estimated that if 4.25 million cubic meters of timber are extracted with new tools throughout the year, 28,610 fewer laborers and 55,846 fewer livestock can be used in a year, and the total cost can be reduced by 3.78 million yuan.

    Fully tap the potential of existing mechanical equipment and increase the proportion of mechanized production

    In addition to vigorously carrying out tool reform and vigorously developing the proportion of year-round operation, fully tapping the potential of existing mechanical equipment is also a realistic and reliable way to solve the shortage of labor and equipment. All timber production enterprises in our province have universally attached importance to this work in the mass movement of technical innovation. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the Shangganling Forestry Bureau increased the proportion of mechanized production from 66 percent at the beginning of the year to 87 percent by fully tapping the potential of existing equipment, greatly improving the efficiency of timber extraction and transportation. By mobilizing tractor drivers to actively learn mechanical principles, improve operating skills, strengthen maintenance, implement three inspections, nighttime maintenance, and amateur joint maintenance systems, etc. In maintenance, the method of "factories going up the mountain and doctors going down to the company" was adopted to strengthen maintenance and minor repairs, greatly reducing downtime, and ensuring that general repairs do not take up working days. By the end of March, the global tractor attendance rate increased from 77.3 percent at the beginning of the year to 86.3 percent; since entering April, it has further increased to more than 90 percent. Therefore, in the five forest farms in the global area that use tractors for timber extraction, although 14 tractors were transferred and 15 tractors were equipped for seasonal production forest farms, the output continued to rise. One forest farm used 10 tractors to extract 8,148 cubic meters of timber in January, and only 5 tractors extracted 9,018 cubic meters in March. The motorcade implemented a train-like operation of timber transportation, increasing the utilization rate of automobiles from 79 percent at the beginning of the year to 97.6 percent. Sen Tie's employees strengthened maintenance in the case of old locomotives and few flatcars, implemented the maintenance of 10,000 locomotives without full inspections and the wheel inspection of flatcars without taking up working days, and improved the attendance rate. In addition, the tool reform of the six seasonal production forest farms under its jurisdiction increased the proportion of mechanization from 66 percent to 87 percent, greatly improving the efficiency of timber production.

    All these achievements are a great victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the result of our vigorously carrying out mass movements under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and adhering to the implementation of the two-legged walking policy. However, although great achievements have been made in the first quarter of last year and this year, not all units have carried out the work very well. At the same time, the proportion of year-round operation in the province's timber production is still very low. This year, our province's timber production task has greatly increased, and the shortage of labor and the lack of machinery appear more prominent in the national all-people Great Leap Forward. Therefore, it is even more necessary to seize the key and weak links in production, carry out effective reforms, tap potential, improve labor productivity, continue to exert all efforts, and further deepen and broaden the tool reform movement. We must focus on the main processes of felling, timber extraction, and timber transportation, and the processes of loading, unloading, and sorting that use the most labor. On the one hand, we must fully tap the production potential of existing mechanical equipment and increase the proportion of mechanized operations; on the other hand, we must vigorously carry out tool reforms, develop small, indigenous, simple, and easy-to-implement semi-mechanization and new-style tools to replace heavy labor, and strive to reduce heavy physical labor to a minimum as soon as possible, greatly reduce cattle and horse slings, and realize year-round operation, so that old equipment, indigenous methods, semi-mechanization, and modern machinery can each show their magical powers, and timber production can achieve a better leap forward in 1959.

    木材采伐必须实行技术革命
    马永顺代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。我是黑龙江省的林业工人，现在仅就我省一九五八年和一九五九年第一季度木材生产方面工具改革的情况向大会作一简要汇报，希望各位代表批评指教。
    黑龙江省林区森林资源较为丰富，是我国最大的木材生产基地。因此，在供应国家社会主义建设所用木材方面担负着重大的任务。几年来我省木材生产数量都占全国木材总产量的三分之一左右。一九五八年和一九五九年，随着国家工农业生产和各项社会主义建设全面大跃进，木材生产任务更大大增加。一九五八年我省木材产量就比一九五七年增加了百分之五十，一九五九年的木材生产任务又比一九五八年的产量增长约百分之四十左右。乍看起来，这两年的木材生产任务都没有翻番，好像算不了什么跃进。但是要知道，木材生产和其他工矿企业不同，它的生产场地都在偏远的深山地区，产品十分笨重，受着天然林木生长情况和季节性的限制。一年要增加这样多的木材产量就是一个很大的跃进了。特别是由于国民经济的全面大跃进带来了劳动力、设备、材料不足的紧张形势；原有的木材生产企业机械化生产比重又很低，很大部分木材任务要依靠大批人马上山用手工作业方式来完成。这就给完成木材生产任务带来了很大困难。这也是木材生产大跃进中一个必须解决的关键性的问题。
    解决这个问题可以有两种方法。一种方法是在现有和可能争取到的机械设备基础上大闹技术革命，大搞群众运动，根据土洋结合、自力更生的方针，大量制造与推广各种行之有效的土设备和新工具；同时，充分挖掘现有机械设备潜力，提高设备利用率。另一种方法是，在困难面前消极悲观，当“伸手派”、“张口派”，完全依靠向上级要机械、要劳力，要不到只好“碍难完成国家任务”，这种方法显然是不好的，前一种方法才是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的方法，我们在生产中正是采取的这一种方法。
    大搞工具改革，减轻繁重的体力劳动，实现了常年作业，木材生产大大提高。
    在一九五八年和一九五九年第一季度，我们在省委的重视与领导下，展开的以技术革命为中心的群众运动，大力开展了木材生产的工具改革运动，获得了显著成绩。我省一九五八年木材生产超额完成了一千零四十万立方公尺的任务，今年第一季度又在木材生产方面取得了巨大成绩，都是和我们在这方面的成就分不开的。不少木材生产企业工具改革运动都搞得有声有色，气象万千，使生产面貌大为改观，通河林业局就是其中一个比较突出的典型。这个局去年在技术革新方面坚持了先土后洋、土洋结合、自力更生、自己装备自己的原则，大力发动群众，开展了规模壮阔的工具改革群众运动。经过一年的苦战，创造与推广了木轨平车、木平车、木轨滑杠、轻便集材器、木滑道、土滑道、冰滑道、小轮集材车、简易架空索道等二十多种集材新工具，使集材工序几乎全部用新工具；使贮木场消灭了“磨骨头”（全靠体力抬木头）。因而，全局常年作业生产比重由一九五七年的百分之十提高到百分之七十二，大大改变了生产面貌。仅下半年一百三十六天就完成集材任务二十三万七千立方公尺，平均日产量由过去马拉套子的一千一百五十立方公尺提高到一千六百四十四立方公尺，提高效率百分之三十。特别是在冬季生产中，群众创造八种适于冬季集材的新工具和铺设的一百五十多条各种滑道，更大显威力，集材日产量提高到二千三百立方公尺到三千五百立方公尺。由于提高了常年作业比重，使木材生产基本上摆脱了季节性的限制，一年四季都可以有节奏的进行了，生产周期也相应地由过去的二百天缩短为二十天。大大减轻了工人重体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，降低了生产成本。因此，该局一九五八年不仅提前两个月完成国家木材生产计划，而且解决了劳力和机械不足的困难。去年冬季全局就少上山农民五千四百五十三名、牲畜四千多头，不仅解决了与农业生产争时间、争劳力、争畜力的矛盾，还节约了大批粮、草等物资储备和运输费用三十一万余元。通河林业局的工人同志曾以这样一首诗歌来评价工具改革的成果，他们说：“新工具，实在好，空中飞，地上跑，常年作业实现了，木材生产大提高，新工具，实在妙，又轻便，又节约，多快好省效率高，笨重劳动解放了。”这充分表现了职工群众在生产上消灭了“磨骨头”的劳动后的愉快心情，也说明了工具改革不仅是实现木材生产计划的一个好办法，也是广大职工的迫切要求。
    实践证明，这些集材新工具有很大的优越性，主要的是：就地取材，制作简单，易于操纵，利于安全，充分利用自然条件，有利于森林更新，适于高山平地，四季皆宜，效率高，成本低。有些新工具在一定条件下还可以完成现有机械目前所不能作的工作，也有些新工具（如轻便集材器，小轮集材车等），再加以发展提高，加上机械动力，就会成为林业生产的现代化工具和机械，大搞新工具实在是当前木材生产工具改革的一个好方向。应该继续发展，努力提高。目前我省木材生产中新工具集材已有很大发展，在第一季度集材总量中，已有百分之三十九是由新工具来完成的，预计全年如果用新工具集材四百二十五万立方米，一年就可少用劳力二万八千六百一十人，牲畜五万五千八百四十六头，总成本可以降低三百七十八万元。
    充分挖掘现有机械设备潜力，提高机械化生产比重
    除了大搞工具改革，大力发展常年作业比重外，充分挖掘现有机械设备的潜力，也是解决劳力设备不足的一个现实可靠的办法。我省各木材生产企业，在技术革新的群众运动中，都普遍重视了这方面的工作。譬如上甘岭林业局今年第一季度由于全面挖掘现有设备潜力，就使机械化生产比重，由年初百分之六十六提高到百分之八十七，大大提高了集运材效率。由于发动拖拉机手，积极学习机械原理，提高操纵技术，并加强保养，实行三检，夜间保养和业余联合保养等制度。在检修中采取“工厂上山，医生下连队”的办法，加强了维修和小修，大大压缩了停修时间，做到一般检修不占工作日。到三月末全局拖拉机出勤率就由年初百分之七十七点三提高到百分之八十六点三；进入四月以来，更进一步提高到百分之九十以上。因此，全局五个用拖拉机集材的林场，虽上调十四台拖拉机，并抽出十五台装备了季节性生产的林场，产量仍然不断上升，一场一月份十台拖拉机集材八千一百四十八立方公尺，三月份只五台就集材九千零一十八立方公尺。汽车队实行了运材列车化，使汽车利用率由年初百分之七十九提高到百分之九十七点六。森铁职工在机车旧、台车少的情况下，加强检修，实行了机车一万台全不检修和台车轮检不占工作日，提高了出勤率。再加上所属六个季节性生产林场的工具改革，就使机械化比重由百分之六十六提高到百分之八十七，大大提高了木材生产效率。
    所有这些成绩都是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是我们在各级党委领导下，大搞群众运动，坚持贯彻执行两条腿走路方针的结果。但是，虽然在去年和今年第一季度取得很大成绩，并不是所有单位都开展的很好的。同时就全省木材生产常年作业比重来说还是很低的。今年我省木材生产任务又大大增加，在国家全民大跃进中，劳力不足和机械缺乏的情况显得更为突出。因此，就更加需要抓住生产中的关键和薄弱环节，进行有效的改革，挖掘潜力，提高劳动生产率，继续鼓足干劲，进一步深入广泛地开展工具改革运动。我们要在采伐、集材运材主要工序和装、卸、归楞等使用劳动量最多的工序上，一方面要充分挖掘现有机械设备的生产潜力，提高机械化作业比重；另一方面大搞工具改革，搞小的、土的、简而易行的半机械化和新式工具来代替笨重劳动，争取尽快把笨重体力劳动减到最低限度，大量减少牛马套子，实现常年作业，使旧设备、土办法、半机械化和现代化机械各显神通，使木材生产在一九五九年取得更好的跃进。
