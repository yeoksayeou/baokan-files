Grasp Ironmaking Raw Material Production Tightly

    To fulfill this year's steel production plan, it is essential to vigorously promote pig iron production. However, to guarantee the increase in pig iron production, it is also crucial to vigorously promote the production of ironmaking raw materials, ensuring ironmaking has sufficient quantity and high-quality materials. Otherwise, ironmaking production will not keep up, and steel production will be affected, which is a very obvious principle.

    For the nation's key iron and steel enterprises, in addition to increasing the output of ironmaking raw materials, efforts should also be made to improve the quality of raw materials. Taking sintered ore, which is needed in large quantities for ironmaking, as an example, every 1% increase in iron content can increase pig iron production in the blast furnace by 2%. A 1% reduction in the ash content of metallurgical coke can increase blast furnace production by 1%. An important reason why some ironmaking enterprises have been able to continuously improve production is the continuous improvement of raw material conditions and the quality of raw materials. This is the case with Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which has maintained the national ironmaking champion title for thirteen consecutive months, and it is also the case with the production improvement of Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, as reported in today's newspaper.

    Currently, there is great potential for improving the conditions of ironmaking raw materials. For example, the iron content of sintered ore is as high as 54% or more in some enterprises, while it is only around 49% in others; the ash content of coke is below 13% in some, while it is above 14% in others. The strength of sintered ore and coke also varies among enterprises. Obviously, if enterprises with lower levels take measures to quickly catch up with advanced enterprises, it will have a tremendous effect on ensuring the increase in pig iron production.

    In order to supply more and better raw materials for ironmaking, so that blast furnaces can eat their fill and eat well, the leadership must vigorously grasp the production links before ironmaking, such as mining, beneficiation, sintering, and coking units. It is necessary to educate the workers in raw material production units, so that they fully understand the importance of their positions; to achieve this, it is necessary to understand each other's production situations and frequently exchange opinions. Establish the concept of "the whole country as a chessboard," so that all production links before ironmaking strive to meet the needs of ironmaking.

    Currently, the nationwide movement to increase production and practice thrift is vigorously unfolding on the iron and steel front. It is hoped that all enterprises, while grasping iron and steel production, will also seize the production of ironmaking raw materials, creating more favorable conditions for ironmaking production.

### 抓紧炼铁原料生产

    抓紧炼铁原料生产
    为了完成今年钢产量计划，必须大抓生铁的生产；但是要保证生铁的增产，还必须大抓炼铁原料的生产，使炼铁有足够数量和高质量的原料。不这样，炼铁生产就跟不上来，钢的生产也会受到影响，这是非常明显的道理。
    就全国重点钢铁企业来说，当前除了要增加炼铁原料的产量以外，还要努力提高原料的质量。以炼铁大量需要的烧结矿为例，含铁量每增加1％，就可以使高炉增产生铁2％；冶金焦炭灰分降低1％，就可以使高炉增产1％。有些炼铁企业生产所以能够不断提高，一个重要原因，就是不断地改善原料条件，提高了原料质量。连续十三个月保持全国炼铁冠军称号的本溪第一钢铁厂的情况是这样，今天本报发表的鞍钢炼铁厂生产提高的情况也是这样。
    目前改善炼铁原料条件的潜力是很大的。例如，烧结矿的含铁量，有的企业高达54％以上，而有的企业只在49％左右；焦炭灰分，有的在13％以下，而有的在14％以上。烧结矿和焦炭的强度，各企业之间也有高低之分。很显然，如果水平较低的企业，采取措施，很快地赶上先进企业，对保证生铁的增产，就会产生极大的效果。
    为了更多更好地供应炼铁的原料，使高炉吃得饱吃得好，领导方面必须大力抓炼铁以前的生产环节，如采矿、选矿、烧结、炼焦等单位的生产。要对原料生产单位的职工进行教育，使他们充分认识到自己所在岗位的重要性；而做到这一点，必须相互了解生产的情况和经常交换意见。树立“一盘棋”的思想，使炼铁以前的一切生产环节都围绕着满足炼铁的需要而努力。
    现在全国钢铁战线上的增产节约运动正在轰轰烈烈地展开，希望各企业在抓钢铁生产的同时，也抓紧炼铁原料的生产，给炼铁生产创造更为有利的条件。
