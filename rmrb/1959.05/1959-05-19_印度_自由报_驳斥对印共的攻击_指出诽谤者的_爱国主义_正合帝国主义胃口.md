Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 18th: Yesterday's "Freedom News," in an editorial entitled "Who is the Traitor?", powerfully answered the Bengali daily "Ananda Bazar Patrika's" defamation of the Indian Communist Party.

The newspaper said that "Ananda Bazar Patrika" accuses the Indian Communist Party of "being loyal to Moscow and Beijing," but this accusation has no originality. "Imperialist agents and representatives of vested interests have been saying this year after year."

"Freedom News" said, "In 'Ananda Bazar Patrika's' view, patriotism means blindly supporting unjust actions, if such actions are committed by our country against another country. This is the kind of patriotism that imperialists promote in order to serve their own interests by creating conflicts between countries."

It exposed "Ananda Bazar Patrika" for using the "Tibet issue" as a smokescreen to cover up the US-Pakistan military agreement.

In response to the accusation that the Indian Communist Party supports China's position and the Chinese government's claims on the Tibet issue, the newspaper said, "Yes, it is doing so because China's position is correct, and China's claims are completely true; Nehru cannot refute China's position, which has proved the truth is beyond doubt. 'Ananda Bazar Patrika' cannot do so either, so 'Ananda Bazar Patrika' does not mention it at all. But if a liar is stupid, then he never stops arguing." The newspaper also asked why "Ananda Bazar Patrika" has not published the "People's Daily" article.

"Freedom News" concluded by saying that it seems its foreign and domestic patrons cannot last long. Therefore, "Ananda Bazar Patrika" - an open enemy of Panchsheel and Sino-Indian friendship, a secret supporter of the imperialist plot to undermine India's independence - is desperately spitting on the Communist Party under the guise of Panchsheel and Sino-Indian friendship, fearing being exposed on the spot. People indeed feel sorry for "Ananda Bazar Patrika."

"Ananda Bazar Patrika's" May 16th editorial went to great lengths to slander the Indian Communist Party, accusing the Indian Communist Party's resolution on the Tibet issue of "being made under Beijing's instructions." It said that the Indian Communist Party is a "traitor" and a "danger to India."

### 印度“自由报”驳斥对印共的攻击  指出诽谤者的“爱国主义”正合帝国主义胃口

    印度“自由报”驳斥对印共的攻击
    指出诽谤者的“爱国主义”正合帝国主义胃口
    新华社新德里18日电　昨天的“自由报”在一篇题为“谁是卖国贼”的社论中，有力地回答了孟加拉文日报“欢喜市场报”对印度共产党的诽谤。
    这家报纸说，“欢喜市场报”指责印度共产党
  “效忠莫斯科和北京”，这种指责并没有什么独创之处。“帝国主义代理人和既得利益集团的代表就是一年又一年地说这种话的。”
      “自由报”说，“在‘欢喜市场报’看来，爱国主义的意思就是盲目地支持不正义的行为，如果这种行为是我国对另一个国家所犯下的话。帝国主义者宣扬的正是这种爱国主义，以便通过制造国家之间的冲突来为它们自己的利益服务。”
    它揭露“欢喜市场报”在利用“西藏问题”作为掩盖美巴军事协定的烟幕。
    在答复所谓印度共产党在西藏问题上支持中国的立场和中国政府的说法这种指责时，这家报纸说，“是的，它正在这样做，因为中国的立场是正确的，中国的说法是完全确实的；尼赫鲁不能对中国的立场提出任何不服，这一点已经证实真实情况是无可怀疑的。‘欢喜市场报’也无法这样做，因此，‘欢喜市场报’对这根本不提。但是如果一个撒谎者是愚蠢的，那么他纠缠起来就老没个完。”这家报纸并且问，“欢喜市场报”为什么没有发表“人民日报”的文章。
     “自由报”最后说，看来，它的外国和本国的恩主不能够长期坚持下去。所以，“欢喜市场报”——潘查希拉和中印友谊的公然的敌人，帝国主义破坏印度独立的阴谋的秘密的支持者——由于害怕给当场识破，正在拼命地以潘查希拉和印中友好为掩护，向共产党吐唾沫。人们的确觉得“欢喜市场报”很可怜。
    “欢喜市场报”5月16日的社论对印度共产党极尽辱骂之能事，它指责印度共产党关于西藏问题的决议“是在北京指示下作出的”。它说，印度共产党是“卖国贼”，是“印度的危险”。
