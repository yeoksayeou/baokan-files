Measures Should Be Taken Immediately Regarding the Laotian Situation
Commentator of this Newspaper

The situation in Laos continues to deteriorate. Instigated by U.S. imperialism, the Royal Lao Government, disregarding the condemnation of world opinion, is further violating the Geneva Accords and the various agreements between the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao combat forces, thereby undermining peace in the Indochina region.

Currently, the Royal Lao Government has not only failed to cease its persecution of the former Pathet Lao combat forces, but has also launched large-scale armed offensives. Leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party and former Pathet Lao combat forces remain under the close surveillance of the Royal Lao military and police. Lao authorities are arresting Patriotic Party members throughout the country and have openly stated that they will declare the Lao Patriotic Party illegal. This shows that the Royal Lao Government is deliberately provoking a bloody war in Laos that ended nearly five years ago. Such actions by the Royal Lao Government, which flagrantly trample on international agreements, violate the interests of the Lao nation, and undermine peace in Indochina, cannot but arouse serious concern and anxiety among countries responsible for safeguarding peace in Indochina and peace-loving people around the world.

In order to stop the United States and the Royal Lao Government from plunging Laos into the abyss of war, and to ease the current tense situation in Indochina, Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has formally requested the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference to take urgent and effective measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and implemented in Laos. The Chinese government and people express their full support for this. Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi reiterated this request in a letter sent to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 25.

The representative of the Royal Lao Government signed the 1954 Geneva Accords and solemnly guaranteed that the Geneva Accords would be fully implemented in Laos. However, now the United States and the Royal Lao Government are saying that the serious actions of the Lao authorities in undermining the Geneva Accords are "internal affairs of Laos," and they describe the just actions of the relevant countries in maintaining the Geneva Accords as "interference in internal affairs." They are attempting to achieve their goal of undermining international agreements and peace in Indochina through this kind of reversal of right and wrong and confusing black and white. Article 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulates: "The Conference takes note of the declaration of the Government of Laos according to which it will take the necessary measures to integrate all citizens into the national community." Article 15 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos also stipulates that the Royal Lao Government "undertakes not to take any reprisals or discriminatory measures against any persons or organizations by reason of their activities during the hostilities; and guarantees their democratic freedoms." The agreements reached between the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao combat forces in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords on December 24, 1956, and November 2, 1957, more clearly stipulated: "Guarantee the civil rights of 'Laotians' and former resistance personnel without discrimination"; guarantee that the Lao Patriotic Party, composed of Lao combat forces and other patriots, can carry out legitimate political activities in the Kingdom of Laos like other political parties. However, now the Royal Lao Government, colluding with U.S. imperialism, goes back on its word, violates the solemn guarantees made internationally, and slanderously accuses the countries concerned in the Geneva Conference of their efforts for peace in Laos and Indochina. This kind of blatant tearing up of all relevant agreements, ignoring international credibility, cannot be tolerated. Like all signatory countries to the Geneva Accords, the Royal Lao Government bears an inescapable responsibility for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

China is a participating country in the Geneva Conference and a guarantor of the Geneva Accords, and is also a close neighbor of Laos. We cannot sit idly by and watch the Royal Lao Government completely abandon the Geneva Accords and endanger peace in Indochina. We believe that the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference, especially the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom as chairmen of the Geneva Conference, as well as the member states participating in the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Indochina, have a responsibility to take immediate action and take urgent measures to stop the conspiracies of the United States and the Royal Lao Government to re-launch a civil war and escalate tensions. The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos should convene a meeting immediately, resume its activities, and prevent further deterioration of the situation in Laos. At this critical juncture, all those concerned about peace in Indochina and the situation in Southeast Asia should make corresponding efforts.

    应立即对老挝局势采取措施
    本报评论员
    老挝的局势仍在不断恶化。老挝王国政府在美帝国主义的唆使下，不顾世界舆论的谴责，进一步毁弃日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间的各项协议，破坏印度支那地区的和平。
    目前老挝王国政府非但没有停止对前寮国战斗部队的迫害，而且发动了规模很大的武装进攻；老挝爱国党和前寮国战斗部队领导人，仍然处在老挝王国军警的严密监视之下；老挝当局在全国各地逮捕爱国党人，并公然表示将宣布老挝爱国党为非法。这表明老挝王国政府蓄意在老挝挑起已经结束了将近五年的流血战争。老挝王国政府这种公然践踏国际协议、违反老挝民族利益和破坏印度支那和平的行为，不能不引起对保障印度支那和平负有责任的国家以及世界各国爱好和平人民的严重关切和焦虑。
    为了制止美国和老挝王国政府把老挝推入战争的深渊，为了和缓目前印度支那地区的紧张局势，越南民主共和国外交部长范文同，已经正式要求1954年日内瓦会议两主席采取紧急和有效的措施，以保证日内瓦协议在老挝得到尊重和贯彻。中国政府和人民对此表示完全的支持。中华人民共和国外交部长陈毅5月25日送致日内瓦会议两主席的信件中，重申了这个要求。
    老挝王国政府代表在1954年日内瓦协议上签了字，曾庄严地保证日内瓦协议在老挝彻底实现。可是，现在美国和老挝王国政府竟说什么老挝当局破坏日内瓦协议的严重行为是“老挝内部的事件”，而把各有关国家维护日内瓦协议的正义行动，说成是什么“干涉内政”。它们企图以这种颠倒是非、混淆黑白的说法，来达到它们破坏国际协议和印度支那和平的目的。日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条明文规定：“会议注意到老挝政府的声明，即它愿意采取使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活的措施。”日内瓦会议关于老挝停止敌对行动协定第十五条也规定，老挝王国政府“保证不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而采取任何报复或歧视，并保证他们的民主自由”。老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队根据日内瓦协议的规定进行谈判，在1956年12月24日和1957年11月2日达成的协议，更明确规定：“保障‘寮国’和前抗战人员的公民权利，而不予以歧视”；保证由寮国战斗部队和其他爱国人士所组成的老挝爱国党在老挝王国同其他政党一样，进行合法的政治活动。可是，现在老挝王国政府勾结美帝国主义，自食诺言，破坏在国际上所作的庄严保证，反口诬蔑日内瓦会议有关国家为老挝和印度支那和平所作的努力。这种明目张胆地撕毁一切有关协议，不知国际信义为何物的行为，是决不能受到宽容的。老挝王国政府像所有日内瓦协议的签字国一样，对日内瓦协议在老挝的彻底实施，负有不可逃避的责任。
    中国是日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的保证国，又是老挝的紧邻，决不能坐视老挝王国政府彻底毁弃日内瓦协议，危及印度支那和平。我们认为，1954年日内瓦会议的参加国、特别是作为日内瓦会议主席国的苏联和英国以及参加印度支那国际委员会的成员国，有责任立即行动起来，采取紧急措施，制止美国和老挝王国政府重新发动内战、加剧紧张局势的阴谋活动。老挝国际委员会应当立即召开会议，恢复活动，阻止老挝局势的进一步恶化。在此严重关头，一切关心印度支那和平和东南亚局势的人们都应作出相应的努力。
