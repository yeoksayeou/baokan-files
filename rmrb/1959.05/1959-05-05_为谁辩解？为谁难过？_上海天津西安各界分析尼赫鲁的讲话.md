Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 4th. Workers, students, government cadres, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai have been holding discussions and writing letters to newspapers for several days to express their opinions on the speech made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on April 27 in the Indian People's Chamber regarding the situation in Tibet, China. People questioned Nehru: In this speech, he defended Indian interventionists and Tibetan rebels, disregarding the truth, what was his purpose?

People focused on three main issues in their discussions and articles: First, what is the truth about the Tibetan rebellion? Second, are the large amounts of slanderous remarks and interventionist actions towards China's internal affairs made by some Indian politicians and newspapers over the past month essentially political? Third, who disregarded the facts and etiquette, and who used cold war language?

Regarding the truth of the Tibetan rebellion, teachers from the Shanghai Municipal Nanshi High School, employees of the Grand Cinema, and residents of Xuhui District pointed out in their discussions and articles that Tibet has a population of 1.2 million, and only 20,000 people participated in the rebellion, most of whom were deceived or coerced. A small number of reactionary elements in the upper echelons of Tibet colluded with foreign countries to undermine the unity and solidarity of the motherland. This has long been clearly recognized by fair world opinion. However, Nehru insisted that the foundation of the Tibetan rebellion was "strong nationalist sentiment"; and said, "To say that this is entirely the responsibility of some 'reactionary elements in the upper echelons' of Tibet seems to be an extraordinary simplification of a complex situation." Nehru's distortion of the truth about the Tibetan rebellion in his speech cannot but draw attention.

When the rebellion in Lhasa and the Shannan area had been quelled, and the Tibetan people were celebrating their new life, Nehru said that a "tragedy" had occurred and was occurring in Tibet, and that "we sympathize very much with the Tibetan people, and we feel very sorry for their situation." People asked: Where does Mr. Nehru's so-called "tragedy" come from, and what is he "sorry" about?

Nehru described the slanderous remarks and interventionist actions towards China's internal affairs made by some Indian politicians and newspapers as "not essentially political." Cao Weifeng, a director of the Shanghai branch of the Writers Association, commented on this in an article, saying, "Mr. Nehru, may I ask, does the Indian People's Chamber discussing China's internal affairs, certain Indian politicians and newspapers viciously attacking our government and the leaders loved by our people, Indian diplomatic officials arranging to distribute the so-called 'Dalai Lama's statement,' the chairman of the Congress Party, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, slandering that China is dragging India into the Cold War, and even talking about a Sino-Indian war, are these not political issues?"

In his speech, Nehru described the Chinese people's counterattack against foreign interventionists as "disregarding facts and etiquette and using cold war language." Xian Wen, a staff member of the Yangpu District government, commented on this, saying that before and after the Tibetan rebellion, many Indian newspapers published lengthy and unfriendly remarks towards China. Among them, 29 newspapers published more than 310,000 words in 42 days, cursing China as "pure imperialism" and saying that "China is invading Tibet." Is this "etiquette"? When the Chinese people could no longer tolerate these arrogant slanders and made solemn condemnations, it was considered not to be "etiquette." Is this fair?

People from all walks of life in Shanghai are still widely discussing Nehru's speech. People believe that Prime Minister Nehru is one of the founders of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but his speech violates these principles. We hope for Sino-Indian friendship, but Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the People's Chamber can hardly be considered friendly.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 4th. People from all walks of life in Tianjin have been seriously discussing the speech made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on April 27 in the Indian People's Chamber. People unanimously believe in their speeches that Nehru's speech distorted the truth.

Some industrial labor models and veteran workers in Tianjin held a forum on the 3rd at the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions. Zhu Guangzhi, a worker at the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Li Jichun, a worker at the Seventh Tool Factory, and Sun Guizhen, a worker at the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, all mentioned in their speeches that Nehru repeatedly stated that he "deeply sympathized" with the Tibetan people. But everyone knows that among the 1.2 million people in Tibet, only about 20,000 participated in the rebellion, and most of them were coerced; those who truly colluded with foreign countries and conspired to betray the motherland were only a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper echelons and the most reactionary serf owners. Nehru should be very clear about this, so why did he warmly receive the Tibetan rebels who fled to India and harmed the people with heinous crimes? Doesn't this clearly expose the truth of the so-called "sympathy for the Tibetan people"? Nehru said that he felt "very sorry" for the "difficult situation" of the Tibetan people, which makes us have to ask: The Tibetan people have gained a new life because the reactionary elements in the upper echelons have been eliminated. This is a great joy for the Tibetan people. Why is Nehru sad instead? Liu Jingying, an old worker at the Renli Woolen Textile Factory, Shan Shu, a worker at the Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant, and Feng Chunli, a railway labor model, unanimously pointed out that Nehru repeatedly said that he would not interfere in China's internal affairs and was willing to maintain Sino-Indian friendship, which is of course very good, but Nehru's words and deeds are inconsistent. Shan Shu said that Nehru said he would not interfere in China's internal affairs, but described Tibet as a "country" and talked about the Tibetan issue in the People's Chamber. Isn't this interfering in China's internal affairs? Feng Chunli said that after reading Nehru's speech, we can't help but ask: What is the basis on which Mr. Nehru hopes to maintain Sino-Indian friendship? Can this friendship be built on the basis of interference in internal affairs?

Cui Yinnian, an engineer and labor model at the Daxin Enamelled Wire Factory, said that Nehru asserted that our accusations against Indian interventionists were "inappropriate and completely unfounded" and "disregarded the facts and etiquette." In fact, our accusations against Indian interventionists are completely justified. Aren't those saying that India and Tibet have a "mother-child relationship," that Tibet is an "independent country," and even wanting to send "volunteer troops" to Tibet all facts that happened in India? Nehru himself said that "Tibetans are not Chinese" and described Tibet as a "country"; Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Gandhi, and Nehru's sister, Mrs. Pandit, both described Tibet as an "independent country." Aren't these based on evidence and facts? The incident of publicly insulting the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao happened in India under the connivance of the Mumbai police authorities. Who is disregarding etiquette?

The workers unanimously stated in their speeches that the Chinese people love peace, and consolidating and developing Sino-Indian friendship is in line with the wishes and interests of the people of both countries. But since imperialists and Indian interventionists come to provoke us, we have the right to fight back. We cannot ignore any acts and conspiracies that interfere in our internal affairs.

Members of the Xinli Village People's Commune have also been holding discussions on Nehru's speech for several days. Lu Xiaoyou said that Tibetan compatriots have long suffered from the oppression of serf owners. We, the peasants who have suffered from the oppression of feudal landlords, deeply sympathize with the Tibetan compatriots' urgent desire for reform. Now, due to the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, the Tibetan people may be able to realize reform as soon as possible, which is a great joy for the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. Why does Nehru say this is a "tragedy"?

At the forum held by the Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipal Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Fan Shaohan, deputy director of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that Nehru once said that "Tibetans are not Chinese" and described Tibet as a "country." But everyone knows that Tibet is an inseparable part of our country's territory. Since the 13th century, Tibet's political system, religious system, and the titles, status, and powers of the Dalai Lama have been successively stipulated by the central governments of our past dynasties. China's sovereignty over Tibet is recognized by the world, and even imperialism cannot deny it. What is Nehru doing by issuing such remarks and openly shielding Tibetan rebels and Indian interventionists?

When the cadres of the Tianjin Municipal Women's Federation held a forum, many people spoke out to refute Nehru's assertion that the slanderous remarks and interventionist actions of some Indian politicians and newspapers against China were "not essentially political." They pointed out: Are those remarks that attempt to split China and describe Tibet as an "independent country" not political? Is it not a political issue that Indian expansionists use all kinds of vicious words to curse China and the leaders of the Chinese people? Are not a series of issues such as sheltering and warmly welcoming the rebels who went to India all political? Residents and housewives in Hongshunli, Hebei District, also expressed their indignation at some of Nehru's fallacies that distorted the facts during the forum. They said that Nehru himself is one of the initiators of the Five Principles. However, he is now openly defending the Indian interventionists who are undermining the Five Principles, which is difficult for the Chinese people to understand.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 4th. People from all walks of life in Xi'an have been holding forums for several days to study the speech made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru on April 27 in the Indian People's Chamber regarding the situation in Tibet.

This morning, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference convened various democratic parties and people's organizations to hold a forum. The participants expressed their regret that Mr. Nehru, the Prime Minister of the great neighboring country of India and the initiator of the Five Principles, should distort the truth and defend Indian interventionists. Many factories, schools, government agencies, shops, troops, street residents, and suburban farmers also held forums. Fei Zhongxian, an advanced producer and veteran worker at the Xi'an Coal Mine Machinery Manufacturing Plant, said at the meeting: "We in the working class have tasted the pain of oppression and exploitation in the old society and express our deep sympathy for the past hellish life of our Tibetan compatriots. We are even more delighted that the Tibetan working people are beginning to gain a free and happy life. But Nehru believes that the People's Liberation Army's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is a 'tragedy.' May I ask Mr. Nehru: Do you think that letting the serf owners of Tibet rule for thousands of generations and using various cruel means to deal with more than 1.1 million Tibetan working people is a comedy?" The Dongfeng and other four people's communes in the suburbs are jointly holding a congress of commune members, and the delegates to the congress discussed Nehru's speech. Li Qingxiu, a delegate to the Dongfeng People's Commune and an activist in socialist construction for women in Shaanxi Province, said in her speech: "When we farmers heard that the People's Liberation Army had won the victory in suppressing the rebellion and that our Tibetan peasant brothers and sisters had gained a new life, we were very happy. But why is Mr. Nehru, who has repeatedly stated that he wants to maintain Sino-Indian friendship, so sad about the situation in Tibet? Who does he have feelings for?"

Tens of thousands of big-character posters have been put up in universities and middle schools, unanimously expressing their disagreement with many of the views in Nehru's speech. Zhala Qiujin, a Tibetan student at Xi'an Medical College, wrote: "When I was only three years old, my father was beheaded and his heart was dug out by reactionary elements in the upper echelons of Tibet, and I was left helpless and suffering. It was only when Chairman Mao sent the 'Bodhisattva soldiers' that I was transformed from a serf into a student and lived a happy life. We will never oppose the motherland. Only a small handful of running dogs of imperialism and reactionary elements in the upper echelons betray the motherland. The situation is that simple, but it is the imperialist elements and Indian expansionists who have made the situation 'extraordinarily' complicated!"

The local organizations of various democratic parties in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City also held forums. On the morning of the 4th, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang convened more than 30 branch leaders in Xi'an to discuss Nehru's speech. The participants pointed out that Mr. Nehru, who initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, violated the Five Principles in his speech and received cheers from British and American imperialism. This is something that Mr. Nehru should think deeply about.

    为谁辩解？为谁难过？
    上海天津西安各界分析尼赫鲁的讲话
    据新华社上海4日电　上海的工人、学生、机关干部和社会各阶层人士，连日来座谈，并且写信给报纸，对印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院就我国西藏局势发表的讲话发表意见。人们质问尼赫鲁：在这篇讲话中为印度干涉者和西藏叛乱分子辩解，竟这样不顾事实真象，究竟是为了什么？
    人们在谈论和文章中，主要集中在三个问题上：一、什么是西藏叛乱事件的真象？二、一个多月来印度的一些政界人士和报刊发表的对中国内政的大量诽谤性言论和干涉性行为，实质上是不是政治性的？三、谁不顾事实真象和礼节，谁使用了冷战的语言？
    关于西藏叛乱事件的真象问题，市南中学教师、大光明电影院职工和徐汇区居民等都在讨论发言和文章中指出，西藏有一百二十万人口，参加叛乱的只有两万人，其中大多数还是被欺骗裹胁参加的。少数西藏上层反动分子里通外国，阴谋破坏祖国的统一和团结，这也是世界的公正舆论早已清楚认识到的。可是尼赫鲁却硬说西藏叛乱的基础是“强烈的民族主义情绪”；又说，“如果说这完全要由西藏若干‘上层反动分子’负责，看来这种说法是把一种复杂的情况异乎寻常地简单化了”。尼赫鲁为什么在讲话中这样歪曲西藏叛乱真象，不能不令人注意。
    当拉萨和山南地区的叛乱已经平息，西藏人民欢庆新生的时候，尼赫鲁却说什么西藏发生了而且正在发生着“悲剧”，又说什么“我们非常同情西藏人民，我们对于他们的处境感到非常难过”。人们问：尼赫鲁先生所谓的“悲剧”究竟从何而来，“难过”的又是什么？
    尼赫鲁把印度一些政界人士和报刊发表的对中国内政的诽谤性言论和干涉性行为说成是“实质上不是政治性的”。作家协会上海分会理事曹未风在文章中对此发表意见说，请问尼赫鲁先生，难道印度人民院讨论中国内政问题，某些印度政界人士和报刊恶毒攻击我国政府和我们全国人民所爱戴的领袖，印度外交官员为散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”进行安排，国大党主席、尼赫鲁的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人诬蔑我国正在把印度拉入冷战，甚至谈到中印战争，难道这不是政治性的问题吗？
    尼赫鲁在讲话中把中国人民对外国干涉者进行的反击说成是“不顾事实和礼节，并且使用了冷战的语言”。杨浦区机关工作人员宪文对此发表意见说，西藏叛乱事件发生的前后，印度的许多报刊连篇累牍地发出了对中国不友好的言论，其中仅二十九家报刊，在四十二天之内就发表了三十一万多字，咒骂中国“是纯粹的帝国主义”，说什么“中国侵略西藏”。难道这是讲“礼节”吗？中国人民在忍无可忍的情况下对这些蛮横的诬蔑进行严正的谴责，反而是不讲“礼节”，这难道是公正的吗？
    对尼赫鲁的讲话，上海各界人民还在广泛地进行讨论。人们认为：尼赫鲁总理是和平共处五项原则的创始人之一，可是他的讲话却违反了这个原则。我们希望中印友好，但是尼赫鲁总理在人民院的讲话却很难使人认为是友好的。
    据新华社天津4日电　天津市各界人民连日来认真讨论了印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院的讲话。人们在发言中一致认为，尼赫鲁的讲话歪曲了事实的真象。
    天津市的一些工业劳动模范和老工人，3日在天津市工会联合会举行了座谈。天津市内燃机厂工人朱广志、第七工具厂工人李继春、天津第二棉纺织厂工人孙桂珍在发言中都讲到，尼赫鲁一再表示他“深切同情”西藏人民。可是谁都知道，在西藏的一百二十万人口中，参加叛乱的只有两万人左右，而且其中多数是被胁迫参加的；真正里通外国蓄谋背叛祖国的不过是一小撮上层反动分子和最反动的大农奴主。这一点，尼赫鲁是应该非常清楚的，那么又为什么对逃到印度去的残害人民、罪大恶极的西藏叛乱分子热情接待呢？这不正明显地暴露了所谓“同情西藏人民”的真象吗？尼赫鲁说对西藏人民的“困难处境”感到“非常难过”，这就使我们不能不问：西藏人民由于清除了上层反动分子而获得了新生，这是西藏人民的一件大喜事，尼赫鲁为什么反而要难过呢？仁立公司毛呢纺织厂老工人刘景英、天津轧钢一厂工人单书、铁路劳动模范冯春立一致指出，尼赫鲁口口声声说不干涉中国内政，愿意保持中印友谊，这当然很好，可是尼赫鲁的言行不一致。单书说，尼赫鲁嘴说不干涉中国内政，却把西藏说成是一个“国家”，并且在人民院大谈西藏问题，这难道不是干涉中国内政吗？冯春立说，看了尼赫鲁的讲话以后，我们不禁要问：尼赫鲁先生所希望保持的中印友谊是建筑在什么基础上的呢？难道说这种友谊能够建筑在干涉内政的基础上吗？
    大新漆包线厂工程师、劳动模范崔荫年说，尼赫鲁断言我们对印度干涉者的指责是“不适当又完全没有根据的”，是“不顾事实真相和礼节”。事实上，我们对印度干涉者的指责是完全有根据的，那些说什么印度和西藏是“母子关系”、西藏是“独立国家”，甚至要派遣“志愿军”来西藏，这些不都是发生在印度的事实吗？尼赫鲁自己就说“西藏人不是中国人”，又把西藏说成是“国家”；尼赫鲁的女儿甘地夫人、尼赫鲁的妹妹潘迪特夫人都把西藏说成是“独立国”，难道这也不是根据和事实吗？公开侮辱我国伟大领袖毛主席像的事情是在印度孟买警察当局的纵容下发生的，这又是谁不顾礼节呢？
    工人们在发言中一致表示，中国人民是爱好和平的，巩固并且发展中印友谊是符合两国人民愿望和利益的。但是既然帝国主义者和印度干涉者来挑衅，我们就有权来回击他，我们对干涉我国内政的任何行为和阴谋都不能置之不理。
    新立村人民公社的社员们连日来也分别就尼赫鲁的讲话进行了座谈。卢效有说，西藏同胞长期受着农奴主的压迫。我们曾经遭受封建地主压迫的农民对于西藏同胞迫切要求改革的心情是十分同情的。现在由于西藏叛乱的平息，西藏人民就有可能尽快实现改革，这是西藏人民和全国人民的大喜事。尼赫鲁为什么说这是“悲剧”呢？
    在政协河北省和天津市委员会举行的座谈会上，中国国民党革命委员会天津市委员会副主任委员范绍韩说，尼赫鲁曾经说“西藏人不是中国人”，又把西藏说成是“国家”。可是大家都知道，西藏是我国领土不可分割的一部分，自从十三世纪以来，西藏的政治制度、宗教制度以及达赖喇嘛的封号、地位和职权等都是由我国历代的中央政府陆续规定的，中国对西藏的主权为全世界所公认，连帝国主义也否认不了。尼赫鲁发出这样一些言论，并且公开袒护西藏叛乱分子和印度干涉者，到底是为了什么？
    天津市妇女联合会的干部在座谈时，许多人发言驳斥了尼赫鲁所谓印度一些政界人士和报刊对中国的诽谤和干涉行为“实质上不是政治性”的说法，他们指出：那些企图分裂中国、把西藏说成是“独立国”的言论不是政治性的吗？难道印度扩张主义分子用尽一切恶毒的字眼来咒骂中国和中国人民的领袖不是政治性问题吗？难道收容并且热情款待到印度去的叛乱分子等等一系列的问题都不是政治性的吗？河北区鸿顺里的居民和家庭妇女们在座谈时也对尼赫鲁歪曲事实的若干谬论表示愤慨，她们说，尼赫鲁本人是五项原则的倡导人之一，可是他现在公然为破坏五项原则的印度干涉者辩解，这是中国人民很难理解的。
    新华社西安4日电　西安市各阶层人民连日来纷纷举行座谈会，研究印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院就西藏局势问题发表的讲话。
    今天上午，政协西安市委员会召集各民主党派、人民团体举行了座谈。与会者在发言中对于作为伟大邻邦印度的总理、五项原则发起人的尼赫鲁先生，竟然颠倒黑白歪曲事实真相，来为印度干涉者辩护，感到十分遗憾。许多工厂、学校、机关、商店和部队、街道市民以及郊区农民也都举行了座谈会。西安煤矿机械制造厂先进生产者、老工人费仲先在会上说：“我们工人阶级在旧社会饱尝被压迫和剥削的痛苦，对藏族同胞过去的人间地狱的生活表示万分同情，我们更为藏族劳动人民开始获得自由幸福的生活感到欢欣鼓舞。而尼赫鲁却认为人民解放军平息西藏叛乱是“悲剧”。试问尼赫鲁先生：你是不是认为让西藏的农奴主们千年万代地统治下去，用各种残酷手段对付一百一十多万西藏劳动人民，这样才算是喜剧呢？市郊东风等四个人民公社正联合举行社员代表大会，大会代表们对尼赫鲁的讲话进行了讨论。东风人民公社社员代表、陕西省妇女建设社会主义积极分子李清秀发言说：我们农民在听到人民解放军平叛胜利，西藏的农民兄弟姐妹从此获得新生，都高兴万分。而口口声声表示要保持中印友谊的尼赫鲁先生，为什么却对西藏局势那么伤感，他究竟是对谁有感情？
    在大、中学校里贴出了千万张大字报，一致表示不能同意尼赫鲁讲话中的很多意见。西安医学院藏族学生扎拉求进写道，当我只有三岁的时候，父亲就被西藏上层反动分子砍掉头，挖了心，从此我便无依无靠受苦受难。到了毛主席派来了“菩萨兵”，才使我从农奴变学生，过着幸福的生活。我们绝不会反对祖国。背叛祖国的只是那一小撮帝国主义的走狗上层反动分子，情况就是这样简单，而是帝国主义分子和印度扩张主义分子使情况“异乎寻常”地复杂化啦！
    各民主党派陕西省和西安市的地方组织也都分别举行了座谈。中国国民党革命委员会陕西省委员会在4日上午，召集西安市三十多个支部负责人座谈尼赫鲁的讲话，与会者指出，倡议和平共处五项原则的尼赫鲁先生，他的讲话违反了五项原则，并且受到英美帝国主义喝彩。这是很值得尼赫鲁先生深思的。
