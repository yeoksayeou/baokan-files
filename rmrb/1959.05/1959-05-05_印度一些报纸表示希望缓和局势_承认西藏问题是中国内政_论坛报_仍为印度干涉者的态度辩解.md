Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 3rd. The latest issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly published an editorial calling for easing the situation caused by the recent developments in Tibet, and saying that any deterioration of the situation "will only cause damage to the major parties involved."

The editorial acknowledged that backward Tibet urgently needs social reforms, and said, "Let us admit that what China wants to do in Tibet is just to implement some urgently needed social and economic reforms, so that Tibet's administration is at least somewhat similar to China and other modern administrations. The reactionary vested interest groups will always hinder progress and the happiness of the people. In the rebellion in Tibet, internal reactionaries were aided and abetted by external reactionary forces to complicate matters." The weekly newspaper hoped that the Dalai Lama could return to Tibet and accept reforms.

The "National Herald" recently published an editorial on the resolution of the National People's Congress on the Tibet issue. The editorial said that this resolution "will be widely welcomed in this country (India)." It said, "People will agree that the Tibet issue is a matter for China and Tibet; and hope that the situation in Tibet will return to normal soon."

At the same time, the newspaper expressed the hope that the Chinese people would stop accusing Indians of having expansionist ambitions.

"The Tribune" recently published an editorial which, on the one hand, admitted that the Chinese people's resentment towards India was understandable, but at the same time said that China's counterattack against Indian expansionists seemed unrestrained, and that India's anger was also justified. The newspaper further argued that China seemed to have more expansionist purposes than India, and that the accusation of expansionism could be turned back on Beijing itself.

The recently published editorial of the monthly magazine "Forum" called for "not letting a Cold War happen in Tibet," comparing India to Don Quixote, saying, "The West may want to see India rush to attack China's windmills in Tibet. But the West's Sancho Panza (Don Quixote's servant - editor) must wait for India's Don Quixote to imitate such heroic behavior." The newspaper emphasized India's goodwill towards China and supported Nehru's attitude on the Tibet issue.

    印度一些报纸表示希望缓和局势
    承认西藏问题是中国内政
    “论坛报”仍为印度干涉者的态度辩解
    新华社新德里3日电　最近一期的“德里时代”周报发表社论，要求缓和由于西藏最近事态发展所造成的局势，并且说局势的任何恶化“只会对主要的有关各方造成损害”。
    社论承认，落后的西藏迫切需要进行社会改革，并且说，“让我们承认，中国在西藏想做的只是要实行某些迫切需要的社会和经济改革，以便使西藏的行政管理至少同中国和其它的现代行政管理多少有点相同。反动的既得利益集团将永远妨碍进步和人民的幸福，在西藏发生的叛乱中，内部反动分子受到外部反动势力的援助和怂恿来使事情复杂化”。这家周报希望达赖能回西藏，并且接受改革。
    “国民先驱报”最近就中国人民代表大会关于西藏问题的决议发表了社论。社论说，这个决议“将在这个国家（印度）受到广泛的欢迎”。它说，“人们将同意，西藏问题是中国和西藏的事务；并且希望，西藏的情况不久将恢复正常。”
    同时，这家报纸表示希望中国人民停止指责印度人有扩张主义野心。
    “论坛报”最近发表社论，它一方面承认中国人对印度的愤懑情绪是可以理解的，但同时又说中国反击印度扩张主义分子显得没有节制，说印度感到愤怒也是正当的。这家报纸还进一步辩解说什么较之印度，中国更像有扩张主义的目的，关于扩张主义的指责可以反过来指责北京自己。
    最近出版的“论坛”月刊的社论要求“不让西藏发生冷战”，它把印度比喻为唐吉呵德说，“西方可能希望看到印度冲去攻击中国在西藏的风车。但是西方的桑可·潘泽（唐吉呵德的仆人——编者）必须等待印度的唐吉呵德来表现模仿这种英雄气概的行为”。这家报纸强调印度对中国的善意，并且支持尼赫鲁在西藏问题上的态度。
