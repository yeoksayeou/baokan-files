Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 22nd: Heilongjiang Province recently held a province-wide material collaboration conference, mobilizing various units to contribute surplus and unsuitable materials for mutual allocation, solving the difficulties faced by many factories and enterprises due to a lack of raw materials.

    The representatives of over 200 factories, enterprises, and other units participating in the conference, based on the principle of ensuring key projects while considering general needs, mutually allocated 8,277 tons of steel, 52 tons of non-ferrous metal materials, 775 tons of pig iron, 75 tons of tin, manganese, iron, and other materials, over 12,500 sets of bearings, over 80 tons of bare copper wire and yarn-covered wire, as well as large quantities of various electrical wires, mechanical equipment, and other materials, enabling many factories and enterprises to obtain the materials they originally lacked.

    Harbin Power Machinery Plant, responsible for manufacturing coal washing equipment, faced difficulties in production due to a shortage of materials such as chrome steel, round steel, flat steel, carbon steel, steel plates, and many accessories (such as transformers, chain gears, chain plates, rollers, etc.). Eight factories and units, including Jianhua, Boiler, Dong'an, and Longjiang Electric, jointly allocated 134 tons of various steel materials, ensuring that the plant's coal washing equipment could be manufactured and delivered quickly. In the past, the main parts of many factories' products had already been produced, but the products could not be completed and delivered due to a shortage of individual materials or accessories. At this conference, these factories' short-term materials or accessories were resolved due to the support of other factories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 22nd: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is vigorously carrying out material inventory work, which has yielded good results. As of May 8th, according to statistics from 335 units that have initially completed inventory work, the materials inventoried include: over 6,800 tons of various steel materials, over 11,900 tons of pig iron, over 800 tons of coke, over 4,300 tons of cement, over 74,000 cubic meters of wood, and 955 units of mechanical and electrical equipment.

    According to the analysis of the Autonomous Region Material Inventory Office, as long as the inventoried materials are properly arranged, some materials can ensure the completion of production and capital construction tasks for the second quarter and the whole year; the materials that are still insufficient after inventory are also much fewer in variety.

    Nanning City, which conducted an inventory in March, this time, led by the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, paid special attention to conducting ideological education work for the employees of various units, focusing on the situation where ideological education work was not deep enough last time. As a result, another 4,000 tons of steel and 2,190 tons of pig iron were inventoried. After ideological education this time, Nanning Motor Factory reported the copper, alcohol, galvanized iron sheet, cotton yarn, and other equipment and materials stored in the factory's warehouse.

    The results of this material inventory in Guangxi prove that many counties and prefectures stored some materials when they established industries last year. There are a large number of raw materials and materials in the warehouses of these counties and prefectures that can be allocated. Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County had never reported any inventory of pig iron in the past, but this time it cleared out more than 110 tons of pig iron. The Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous County, which has the weakest industrial base, this time cleared out 2,500 kilograms of pig iron, 3,340 kilograms of steel, 6,150 kilograms of cement, and 9,000 kilograms of gasoline and diesel in only three units.

    黑龙江广西有组织地调剂物资支援重点
    据新华社哈尔滨22日电  黑龙江省最近通过全省物资协作会议，发动各个单位拿出多余物资和不适用的物资，相互调剂，解决了许多工厂企业缺乏原料和材料的困难。
    参加这次会议的二百多个工厂企业等单位的代表，根据保证重点、照顾一般的精神，相互调剂了钢材八千二百七十七吨，有色金属材料五十二吨，生铁七百七十五吨，锡、锰、铁等七十五吨，轴承一万二千五百多套，裸铜线和纱包线八十余吨，以及各种电线、机电设备等大量物资，使不少工厂企业原来缺少的物资得到了供应。
    哈尔滨动力机械厂担负着制造洗煤设备的任务，因为缺少铬钢、元钢、扁钢、炭素钢、钢板材料，以及许多配件（如变压器、链子齿轮、链子板、滚轴等），在生产中发生了困难，建华、锅炉、东安、龙江电工等八个工厂单位就共同调剂出各种钢材一百三十四吨，保证这个厂的洗煤设备能很快制造出厂。过去，许多工厂产品的主要部分已经生产出来，因为缺少个别材料或配件使产品全部制成不能出厂。在这次会议上，这些工厂短缺的材料或配件，都因其他工厂的支援而得到解决。
    据新华社南宁22日电　广西僮族自治区大张旗鼓地开展物资清理工作，已经收到了很好的效果。截止5月8日，据三百三十五个初步结束清理工作的单位统计，已经清理出的物资计有：各种钢材六千八百多吨，生铁一万一千九百多吨，焦炭八百多吨，水泥四千三百多吨，木材七万四千多立方公尺，机电设备九百五十五台。
    据自治区物资清理办公室分析，只要妥善安排清理出的物资，有些物资就可以保证完成第二季度以及全年的生产、基建任务；有些经过清理仍然不足的物资，所缺品种也少得多了。
    曾经在3月份进行过清理的南宁市，这次由市委第一书记挂帅，针对前次思想教育工作做得不够深透的情况，特别注意对各单位职工进行“全国一盘棋”的思想教育工作，结果又清理出钢材四千多吨，生铁二千一百九十多吨。南宁市电机厂这次经过思想教育后，报出了厂内仓库里贮存的紫铜、酒精、镀锌铁皮、棉纱等器材物资。
    广西这次清理物资的结果证明，许多县和专区去年办工业时，都贮藏了一部分物资，这些县和专区的仓库里，有大量原料和材料可供调剂。三江侗族自治县过去从来没有报过生铁有库存，这次却清出生铁一百一十多吨。工业基础最薄弱的大瑶山瑶族自治县，这次仅在三个单位里就清理出生铁二千五百公斤，钢材三千三百四十公斤，水泥六千一百五十公斤，汽油柴油九千公斤。
