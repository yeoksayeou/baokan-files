Mother Huang Visits Soldiers in the Army
Zhao Xu

These days, the temperature has risen to twenty-three or twenty-four degrees Celsius, but the thirty-eight new soldiers from the heroic Huang Jiguang's hometown in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army are even more excited, because they have met Mother Huang, the mother of the hero Huang Jiguang, whom they have been longing to meet, in the remote northeast.

Mother Huang's visit to the army was not accidental. In March of this year, at the send-off meeting for young people of conscription age in Jiguang's hometown, Mother Huang said: "Children, study hard in the army, and I will come to see you if I have the opportunity." Last month, Mother Huang went to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress. She learned that the young soldiers from Huang Jiguang's hometown were all assigned to a unit in the Northeast and were doing very well in their studies, which made her very happy. During a break in the meeting, she wrote a letter to the leaders of the unit, thanking them for their education of the young people from her hometown and expressing her wish to visit the unit. The unit leaders and all the soldiers welcomed Mother Huang very much, and the soldiers from Huang Jiguang's hometown specially sent two representatives to Beijing to greet her.

On May 14, shortly after Mother Huang arrived at the barracks, she asked to visit the soldiers' dormitories. When Mother Huang arrived at the soldiers' dormitories, the soldiers surrounded her, greeting Mother Huang as if they were meeting a mother they had been separated from for a long time. Five-good soldiers Gu Shunjian, Chen Yingfu, Yuan Anjian, and Gu Daiwen, and sharpshooters Gu Daiyong and Yuan Anzhi, took out their beloved merit certificates and honorary certificates from their pockets and handed them to Mother Huang one by one. They told Mother Huang that these were their initial achievements in learning from their brother Jiguang, and asked her to take them back to the people of their hometown, and that they would continue to work hard and ensure that they create even greater honors. Sun Jiazhi, the leader of the veteran Third Squad, came over and said to Mother Huang: "Huang Jiguang is a role model for all our soldiers. I will work hard to lead the new soldiers so that they can quickly master their weapons and defend our country." Mother Huang smiled contentedly and took the squad leader's hand, saying: "I will go back and tell the people of my hometown that the children are living well in the army, and with the help of you veteran comrades and the education of the leaders, they are making rapid progress and don't need to be worried about."

The lush green branches rustled in the wind, and gusts of sand swirled across the parade ground. At this moment, the soldiers, with excitement, demonstrated their various military skills to Mother Huang.

Signalman Gu Daiwen, who used to be a member of Mother Huang's Red Flag Production Team, put on his headphones and quickly tapped the key, and then quickly copied the code onto paper. He told Mother Huang that with the help of veteran comrades, after a month of hard work and practice, he had initially mastered the key points of connecting dots and dashes in sending messages, and could copy twenty groups per minute when receiving messages, completing the year-end target ahead of schedule. Chen Yingfu, a machine gunner and a militia captain from the Jiguang People's Commune, demonstrated shooting actions to Mother Huang. He said to Mother Huang very excitedly: "This thing can not only kill large groups of enemies, but also stand up and shoot enemy planes. I have fallen deeply in love with it!" Mother Huang encouraged him, saying: "Good! Practice hard, and use it to avenge your brother Jiguang in the future!"

After the demonstration of the four types of infantry weapons, the soldiers lined up in two rows and performed physical exercises for Mother Huang. Mother Huang was very happy to see that these children with childish faces, some of whom only knew how to use hoes two months ago, and some of whom were still in primary school in the commune, had now learned a lot of military skills. She repeatedly thanked the leaders of the unit for their education and the veteran comrades for their help on behalf of the people of her hometown.

In a bright and clean Leap Forward room, the thirty-eight new soldiers from Huang Jiguang's hometown had a cordial conversation with Mother Huang.

Mother Huang told the soldiers that after the hard work in February and March, the production in her hometown was very good this year, the spring harvest was abundant, and the summer grain output was expected to double and cotton to triple. The people of her hometown are now proposing to work hard to increase production and support national construction. She asked everyone: Didn't you say that you want to learn from your brother Jiguang? Then, show it with practical actions!

At this moment, the soldier Hu Denglin suddenly stood up from his seat and answered. He said: "The new soldiers from our Huang Jiguang's hometown have not disappointed you. Among our thirty-eight people, four were named five-good soldiers in April, and two were named sharpshooters." The soldier Huang Xianbi said: "I didn't do well in the first practice, but I got excellent in the second practice. This time, I will consolidate my excellent results in the third practice." The soldiers' firm determination made Mother Huang very happy. She reminded the soldiers in a gentle tone, caring for them like a mother caring for her children: "You must always learn with an open mind and never be proud." The soldier Gu Daiyong replied on behalf of everyone: "We will definitely remember Mother Huang's words, continue to move forward, never be complacent, and ask the people of our hometown to wait and see the new achievements we create!"

    黄妈妈到部队看望战士
    赵徐
    这几天，气温升到二十三、四度，可是，解放军某部来自英雄黄继光乡的三十八名新战士，心情比天气不知还要热多少倍，因为他们和盼望已久的英雄黄继光的母亲，在远离家乡的东北地区会面了。
    黄妈妈来到部队不是偶然的。今年3月，在继光家乡欢送适龄青年入伍大会上，黄妈妈就说过：“孩子们到部队好好学习吧，有机会我要来看你们的。”上月，黄妈妈到北京参加全国人民代表大会，她得知黄继光乡的青年战士，全分配在东北地区的一个部队里，学习成绩很好，心里非常愉快。在开会空隙，她就给部队领导上写了一封信，一面感谢部队对家乡青年的教育，一面希望来部队看一看。部队首长和全体战士都非常欢迎黄妈妈到来，黄继光乡的战士们，还特别派出两名代表到北京去迎接她老人家。
    5月14日，黄妈妈来到营房不久，就要求到战士宿舍去参观。当黄妈妈来到战士宿舍，战士们围上来了，他们像会见久别的母亲一样，争着向黄妈妈问好。五好战士顾顺建、陈英富、袁安建、顾代稳，射击标兵顾代勇、袁安志，他们从衣袋里掏出自己心爱的喜报和荣誉证，一个一个地送到黄妈妈手里。他们告诉黄妈妈，这是向继光哥哥学习的初步成绩，请你老带给家乡人民吧，我们还要继续努力，保证创造更大的荣誉。老战士三班长孙家志走过来向黄妈妈说：“黄继光是我们全体战士学习的榜样，我一定努力带好新战士，使他们早日熟练手中武器，保卫我们的祖国。”黄妈妈满意地笑了，她拉着班长的手讲：“我回去要告诉家乡的人民，孩子们在部队生活很好，有你们老同志的帮助，上级的教育，进步很快，用不着惦念了。”
    葱绿树枝，被大风刮得呜呜响，操场上，不时扬起了一阵阵迷眼沙土。就在这个时候，战士们怀着激动的心情，向黄妈妈表演着自己学得的各种军事技术。
    通信兵顾代稳，原来是黄妈妈红旗生产队的队员，他戴上耳机，一会敏捷地按着电键，一会迅速地在纸上抄着电码。他告诉黄妈妈，在老同志的帮助下，经过一个月的苦学苦练，现在发报已初步掌握点划连结要领；收报每分钟能抄二十组，提前完成了年终指标。重机枪手陈英富，继光人民公社的一个民兵队长，他给黄妈妈表演了射击动作。他很兴奋地对黄妈妈说：“这家伙不但能杀伤大群敌人，还能竖起来打敌人飞机，我已经深深爱上它了！”黄妈妈鼓励他说：“好哇！加劲练吧，将来用它给你继光哥哥报仇！”
    四种步兵武器表演完了，战士们又排成两行，给黄妈妈表演体育动作。黄妈妈看见这群脸上带着稚气的孩子，两个多月前，有的只会使锄头，有的还在公社小学里念书，现在，都学得了不少军事本领，表示非常高兴，她再三代表家乡人民，感谢部队首长的教养，感谢老同志们的帮助。
    在一间窗明几净的跃进室里，来自黄继光乡的三十八名新战士，和黄妈妈进行着亲切的交谈。
    黄妈妈告诉战士们，经过2、3月份的苦战，今年家乡生产很好，小春已丰收，夏季粮食产量争取翻一番，棉花增两倍，家乡人民现在都提出要努力增加生产，支援祖国建设。她问大家：您们不是说要向继光哥哥学习吗？那么，拿出实际行动来看吧！
    这时候，战士胡登林忽然从座位上站起来回答。他说：“我们黄继光乡的新战士，没有辜负您的希望。我们三十八个人中，4月份有四个人评为五好战士，有两个人评为射击标兵。”战士黄贤壁说：“第一练习我没打好，第二练习打了优秀，这回打第三练习，我保证巩固优秀成绩。”战士们的坚强决心，使黄妈妈感到很高兴。她用老年人关心孩子的温和口吻提醒战士们：“要永远虚心学习，千万不能骄傲。”战士顾代勇代替大家回答：“我们一定记住黄妈妈的话，继续前进，永不自满，请家乡人民等着看我们创造的新成绩吧！”（附图片）
