Spurred by the bumper harvests of summer grain and oilseed crops, the broad masses of peasants in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces are working closely with the state commercial departments to implement rapid harvesting, rapid threshing, rapid delivery, rapid selling, and rapid transportation in one continuous process, sending the harvested grain and oilseeds steadily into state warehouses. As of May 25th, Sichuan Province had already purchased 52.6 million jin of wheat and beans and 142.442 million jin of rapeseed. As of May 20th, the amount of rapeseed, rapeseed oil, and wheat stored in Hunan Province had increased by about 40% compared to the same period last year. Hubei Province had purchased and stored a total of 10 million jin of rapeseed as of May 25th. As of May 20th, Fujian Province had purchased and stored 14.72 million jin of barley and wheat. Jiangxi Province has already purchased and stored 230,000 jin of new grain and 5.5 million jin of rapeseed. Currently, the summer grain and oilseed harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting work in these five provinces is continuing intensively.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 28th: Riding the wave of bumper harvests, various areas in Sichuan Province are comprehensively and forcefully carrying out the requisition and purchase of grain and oilseeds, and the requisition and purchase work is progressing rapidly. Commercial cadres at all levels throughout the province have gone deep into the communes and teams to specifically assist the communes in arranging labor, rushing to thresh and dry the grain, and selling the bumper harvests of grain and rapeseed to the state. As of May 25th, the province had requisitioned and purchased 52.6 million jin of wheat and beans, and 142.442 million jin of rapeseed.

This year, Sichuan's summer grain and oilseed crops have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. As early as April, relevant departments convened meetings to allocate this year's summer grain and oilseed requisition and purchase tasks to various regions, and instructed all regions to transfer cadres to strengthen financial and trade organizations at all levels, and to fully prepare for the summer grain and oilseed requisition and purchase work. In order to make the distribution of requisition and purchase tasks reasonable, taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members, and to ensure the timely and complete fulfillment of the state's requisition and purchase tasks, the grain departments in many regions conducted pilot requisition and purchase work in the communes, and convened symposiums with the participation of commune cadres to study this year's summer grain and rapeseed requisition, purchase, and distribution issues, and unified ideological understanding. For example, before the rapeseed harvest, the Party Committee of the Hujia People's Commune in Longchang County convened a meeting of cadres from the commercial departments and production teams and above, so that everyone realized that selling agricultural products to the state is the glorious task and important responsibility of the People's Commune's management areas, thus laying the ideological foundation for rapid harvesting, rapid threshing, rapid selling, and rapid warehousing. Then, the commune Party committee distributed the tasks to the basic-level Party branches in the management areas, and the supply and marketing cooperative directly signed contracts with the management areas or production teams; on the other hand, the supply and marketing cooperative also distributed the tasks to various distribution stores and purchasing points, so that the tasks were implemented at every level and took root at every level. Now, this commune has delivered more than 642,000 jin of rapeseed in just twenty days, exceeding the state's unified purchase task.

At the same time, in the purchasing work, all regions have regarded putting politics in command, publicizing policies, and mobilizing the masses as the main key to the requisition and purchase tasks. Luzhou, Neijiang, Jiangjin and other special districts have successively launched publicity work among commune members. While assigning the summer grain requisition and purchase figures and varieties to the commune, the Qiuxi District of Zizhong County mobilized commune members to calculate four accounts, namely: (1) the account of increased production of small spring grain; (2) the account of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance by completing the requisition and purchase tasks; (3) the account of increased commune retention and expanded reproduction; (4) the account of increased grain consumption and increased cash income for commune members. Through calculation, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for selling grain was stimulated. When purchasing rapeseed, Longchang County also used various meetings, big-character posters, blackboards, and wired broadcast meetings to carry out publicity, so that the purchasing policy was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household.

Because of the large quantity of summer grain and oilseeds purchased this year and the concentrated time, the commercial departments paid special attention to starting from many aspects, properly arranging labor, and organizing warehousing in a timely manner. The commercial department of Meishan County transferred 17 leading cadres to form five working groups, which went deep into the grassroots to organize farmers to sell rapeseed. They organized commune members to sell rapeseed in batches in the early morning and evening or during market days. In twenty days, they completed 51% of the county's purchase task. In the summer grain requisition and purchase in Leshan County, in addition to adopting the method of fixing personnel, time, quantity, and quality, they also helped the commune to arrange grain sources and prepare storage capacity. The communes adopted the method of combining seed grain with cultivated areas, combining food grain with mills and canteens, and combining requisitioned grain with the flow of state granaries, so as to rationally arrange grain sources and save labor. According to the experience of carrying out direct transportation in previous years, the county also planned a total of 26 grain collection points according to the principle of reasonable flow direction, so that more than 84% of the requisitioned summer grain in the county could be directly transported to the water and land transportation lines at one time, reducing the work of re-collection and transportation, and saving more than 100 million yuan in transportation costs and more than 12,000 laborers.

In the purchase of grain and rapeseed, all regions followed the spirit of pricing according to quality and implemented the price policy of more and higher grades. Yongchuan County's districts and communes adopted the method of joint consultation between leaders and the masses to implement the principle of high quality and high price. All purchasing points were equipped with "fair scales" and sample tables, which made the masses very satisfied. In order to facilitate the masses, many regions also set up medical stations, tea water buckets, benches, etc., which encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to sell grain and oilseeds.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient summer grain processing tools and labor this year, the grain departments in various regions took the initiative to help the communes vigorously carry out tool reforms with the utilization of water and animal power as the main content. The grain department of Leshan County helped Angu Commune repair three water mills and thirteen water grinders, and sent cadres to assist the commune in establishing three animal-powered grinding machines, and also reasonably adjusted the processing productivity between the commune management areas, thus basically overcoming the difficulties of wheat processing and labor shortage.

At present, various areas in Sichuan are continuing to strengthen the leadership of the summer grain and rapeseed purchasing work, using methods such as newsletters, telephone conferences, coordination meetings, and inspections and comparisons to commend the good and urge the poor. Suining, Longchang, Zhongxian and other places also regularly issue progress reports on the delivery of grain and rapeseed by various units, so that the delivering units can timely understand the situation of completing tasks, so as to constantly improve their work and promote the early completion of the requisition and purchase tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 28th: In order to adapt to the new situation of the unprecedented bumper summer harvest after the communization of the whole province, the commercial departments in various parts of Sichuan have organized more materials to go to the countryside than in previous years, vigorously supporting the summer harvest and summer planting, and meeting the growing multi-faceted needs of the countryside in production and life. According to incomplete statistics, the province has supplied more than 100 million pieces of summer harvest tools and millions of tons of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, daily necessities, etc. At present, a large number of materials are being rushed to the countryside.

In order to organize materials, especially production materials, to supply the needs of the countryside this summer, the commercial departments in various regions began to arrange forces, count warehouses, collect raw materials, and carry out large-scale production as early as the end of last year. Therefore, by the eve of the wheat harvest, the commercial production reserve in general areas exceeded the plan by more than 50%, which was nearly doubled compared with the same period last year. While manufacturing new summer harvest and summer planting tools, various regions also organized workers to go deep into the communes to carry out the repair work of small farm tools. The commercial supply and marketing departments of only five counties, Nanchong, Zhongxian, Longchang, Fushun, and Zhongjiang, organized more than 7,000 employees to go deep into the countryside to repair and assemble more than 2 million pieces of various farm tools for commune members.

In the process of organizing the supply of goods to the countryside, various regions also paid attention to mutual cooperation between regions. Many special districts and counties convened internal material exchange and adjustment meetings of commercial departments. Some districts also conducted adjustments between townships and townships, and teams and teams. Through internal adjustment, Jiangjin County extracted 500,000 pieces of large and small farm tools to support other districts.

In the spirit of facilitating the masses everywhere and fully supporting the summer harvest and summer planting production, the commercial departments in various regions have vigorously strengthened the purchase and sale business. In addition to strengthening the leadership of rural service stores, the commercial department of Longchang County also set up 108 fixed night business outlets in the market towns. In the current upsurge of summer harvest and summer planting, the county has organized more than 500 mobile purchase and sale peddlers; and extracted more than 1,000 commercial personnel, compiled into production assault teams, carrying production tools and goods, went to the countryside to set up camps, went to the towns on market days to do business, and returned to the countryside in the fields to produce and purchase and sell.

    夏粮油料收打购运要一气呵成
    四川湖南湖北福建江西粮食菜籽源源入库
    四川商业部门发挥高度积极性协同公社收打购运，大量供应物资
    四川、湖南、湖北、福建、江西五省广大农民，在夏季粮食和油料作物丰收的鼓舞下，和国家商业部门通力协作，实行快收、快打、快交、快售、快运，一气呵成，把收获的粮食油料源源送进国家仓库。四川省到5月25日止，已经收购小麦、豆类五千二百六十万斤和油菜籽一亿四千二百四十二万斤；湖南省至5月20日止，菜籽、菜油和小麦入库量，比去年同期增加40％左右；湖北省到5月25日征购入库的菜籽共达一千万斤；福建省到5月20日止，收购入库的大麦小麦达一千四百七十二万斤；江西省已有二十三万斤新粮和五百五十万斤油菜籽征购入库。目前，这五个省的夏粮油料收打购运工作继续在紧张地进行。
    本报成都28日电　四川省各地乘丰收之浪，全面突征收购粮食和油料，征购工作进展很快。全省各级商业干部已经深入社、队，具体协助公社安排劳动力，突击脱粒晒干，把丰收的粮食、菜籽卖给国家。截至5月25日，全省征购的小麦和豆类已达五千二百六十万斤，油菜籽一亿四千二百四十二万斤。
    今年，四川夏粮和油料作物都获得空前大丰收。早在4月份，有关部门便召开了会议，把今年夏粮、油料征购任务分配到各地，并且指示各地抽调干部充实各级财贸机构，充分作好夏粮和油料征购的准备工作。为了使征购任务分配合理，统筹兼顾国家、集体、社员三方面的利益，保证如期如数完成国家征购任务，许多地区的粮食部门都在公社进行了征购的试点工作，并且召开了有公社干部参加的座谈会，就今年夏粮、油菜征购和分配等问题进行了研究，统一了思想认识。如隆昌县胡家人民公社的党委在油菜收割前，就召开了商业部门和生产队以上的干部会议，使大家认识到向国家交售农产品是人民公社各管理区的光荣任务和重大职责，从而奠定了快收、快打、快交售、快入仓的思想基础。然后，公社党委将任务分配到管理区各基层党支部，由供销部与管理区或生产队直接签订合同；另一方面，供销部也将任务分到各分销店和收购点，使任务层层落实，级级生根。现在，这个公社在短短二十天内，就交售了六十四万二千多斤油菜籽，超额完成了国家统购任务。
    同时，各地在收购工作中，都把政治挂帅、政策宣传、发动群众，作为征购任务的主要关键之一。泸州、内江、江津等专区先后在社员群众中展开了宣传工作。资中县球溪区把夏粮征购数字和品种安排到公社的同时，发动社员算了四笔账，即：（1）小春粮食增产账；（2）完成征购任务，巩固工农联盟账；（3）公社提留增加，扩大再生产账；（4）社员吃粮增加，现金收入增加账。通过算账，激发了干部和群众的售粮积极性。隆昌县在收购油菜籽时，还利用各种会议、大字报、黑板报和召开有线广播会等形式进行宣传，使收购政策深入人心，家喻户晓。
    由于今年夏粮、油料的收购的数量大、时间集中，商业部门特别注意从多方面动手，妥善安排劳力，及时组织入库。眉山县商业部门抽调十七个领导干部，组成五个工作组，深入基层组织农民出售菜籽。他们组织社员利用早晚或赶场时间成批出售油菜籽，在二十天里，便完成全县收购任务的51％。乐山县在夏粮征购中，除了采取定人员、定时间、定量、定质的办法外，还帮助公社进行粮源摆布和仓容的准备工作。各公社采取了种子粮与耕作区相结合、口粮与磨坊食堂相结合、征购粮与国家粮库流向相结合的办法，合理摆布粮源，节省劳力。这个县还根据历年来开展直线运输的经验，按照合理流向的原则，共规划了二十六个收粮点，使全县84％以上的征购夏粮，都能一次集运到水陆交通沿线，减少了再度集运的工作，可节约运费一亿多元和劳动力一万二千多个。
    各地在粮食、油菜收购中，本着按质论价的精神，贯彻执行了多等多级的价格政策。永川县各区、社采取了领导和群众共同协商的办法，贯彻执行了优质优价的原则，各收购点都设了“公平秤”、样品台，使群众十分满意。许多地区为了方便群众，还设置了医药站、茶水桶、板凳等，鼓舞了群众出售粮食和油料的积极性。
    为了解决今年夏粮加工工具和劳力不足的问题，各地粮食部门主动地帮助公社大搞以利用水力和畜力为主要内容的工具改革。乐山县粮食部门帮助安谷公社修整了水磨三部、水碾十三部，并派出干部协助公社建立了三部畜力拉磨机，对公社管理区之间的加工生产力也进行了合理调整，这样就基本上克服了小麦加工和劳力不足的困难。
    现在，四川各地正在继续加强对夏粮、油菜收购工作的领导，利用简报、电话会、碰头会、检查评比等办法，表扬好的，督促差的。遂宁、隆昌、忠县等地还定期发出各单位交售粮食、油菜的进度战报，使交售单位及时了解完成任务的情况，以便经常改进工作，促使提前完成征购任务。
    本报成都28日电　四川各地商业部门为适应全省公社化后第一个夏季农业空前丰收的新形势，组织了比往年更多的物资下乡，大力支援夏收夏种，满足农村中在生产和生活上日益增长的多方面需要。据不完全统计，全省已供应了一亿多件夏收工具以及上百万吨的化肥、农药、生活日用品等。目前，大批物资正在源源不断地向农村赶运中。
    各地商业部门为了组织物资，特别是生产资料，供应今夏农村中的需要，早在去年年底就陆续开始安排力量，清点仓库，搜集原料，大量进行生产。因此，到麦收前夕为止，一般地区的商业生产储备量都超出计划50％以上，比去年同期增大近一倍。各地在新造夏收夏种工具的同时，还组织工人深入公社，开展小农具的整修工作。仅南充、忠县、隆昌、富顺、中江等五个县的商业供销部门，就组织了七千多个职工深入农村，为公社社员修配了各种农具两百多万件。
    在组织货源下乡中，各地还注意了地区间的互相协作。许多专区和县召开了商业部门的内部物资交流调剂会。有的区还进行了乡与乡、队与队之间的调剂。江津县通过内部调剂，就抽出了五十万件大小农具支援外区。
    各地商业部门本着处处便利群众，全力支援夏收夏种生产的精神，大力加强了购销业务。隆昌县商业部门除加强对农村服务商店的领导外，在场镇上还设立了一百零八个固定性的夜间营业门市部。在目前夏收夏种高潮中，全县共组织了流动部购销货郎担五百多个；并抽出一千多个商业人员，编成生产突击队，随带生产工具和商品，开赴农村安营扎寨，逢场子到镇上经营业务，闲天回转农村，在田间边生产边购销。（附图片）
