    Every Morning (Short Story)
    Hu Yixiao
    Every morning, I take the No. 16 bus to the blind people's hardware factory to work. Because my wife works in the west of the city and I work in the east, he can't take me to work. After getting off the bus, I have to feel my way to the hardware factory. In the evening, my colleague's family comes to pick him up and gives me a ride, so it's not a problem.
    One morning last autumn, just as someone was helping me off the bus, I suddenly heard a boy's voice: "Auntie Liu, good morning!" Then, a small hand took my arm and wanted to take me to the factory. I was surprised and said, "Little friend, you've mistaken me for someone else, I am...", he interrupted, "Auntie, isn't your surname Liu? Don't you work at the blind people's factory? I'm here to take you to work."
    What was going on? It turned out that the children in his school had launched a "Do a good deed for the people" campaign. Yesterday, when he was going to school, he saw an uncle with poor eyesight on the road, tapping the road with a cane. It was just getting light at the time, and there were almost no people on the road. He went over and took the uncle's arm and asked, "Uncle, where are you going?" The uncle told him that he was going to the blind people's hardware factory. He said, "Uncle, our school is not far from the blind people's factory, I can take you to work, every day." The uncle was very grateful to him and said, "You are a good boy! My family sends me every day, but they had something to do today. You better take our factory's Auntie Liu in the future, she comes on the No. 16 bus every day and gets off at the station ahead." Then, he described my appearance to him, so he came to take me today.
    Of course, I was very moved, and said, "You are a good boy! What's your name? I'll tell your school, so everyone will know your good deeds and learn from you." This child usually loves to talk, but this time he didn't say anything. I asked him again and again, and he said, "Auntie Liu, helping others is what Young Pioneers should do, there's no need for others to know. We have a classmate in our school who saved the lives of two little children from the water, but he never said anything, and people only found out two years later."
    One winter morning, my husband told me that it was snowing heavily outside, and I had a bit of a headache, so he told me not to go to work.
    After my husband left, I felt uneasy. I thought, that little friend must be at the bus stop to pick me up, but I didn't go!... Then I thought, if the little friend doesn't wait for me, he will go to school himself...
    I was thinking, when I suddenly heard a familiar, mellow voice calling me: "Auntie Liu! Is Auntie Liu at home?" Ah! It was that little friend! He found my house! I quickly said, "I'm home. Come in." As soon as he came in, he said breathlessly: "Auntie, I didn't wait for you at the station, I just thought I was late and you had gone to the factory. I ran to the factory to ask, and the people at the factory said you hadn't gone. I thought, it's snowing so heavily today, could something have happened to Auntie Liu on the road? So I asked for your address and came here..."
    I quickly put on my clothes, grabbed a few steamed buns, put them in a bag, and went out with him.
    The day before yesterday, when I got off the bus, I suddenly heard a little girl's voice: "Auntie Liu, good morning!" Then, a little hand took my arm and wanted to take me to the blind people's factory. At first I felt strange, but after the little girl explained, I learned that she was the little friend's sister! She told me that her brother had gone to middle school, so the task of taking me to work was handed over to her. Her brother told her that it was her turn to take me now, and if she went to middle school, the task of taking me would be handed over to their younger brother.
    I don't know what words to use to express my inner excitement. I am determined to write this matter down, to tell everyone I know or don't know, to write a hymn, to praise our lovely children, to praise the great mother who educates them to grow - our Party!

    每天早晨（小小说）　
    胡忆肖
    每天早晨，我搭十六路汽车到盲人五金工厂去上班。因为我爱人在城西工作，我在城东工作，所以他不能送我上班。下车后，到五金工厂的一段路，就靠我摸着走了。晚上，同事的家里人来接他，顺便带我上车，所以还不碍事。
    去年秋天的一个早晨，正当别人扶着我下车的时候，忽然听到一个男孩子的声音：“刘阿姨，您早！”接着，就有只小手挽住我，要送我到工厂去。我感到奇怪，就说：“小朋友，你别认错了人，我是……”，他抢着说：“阿姨，您不是姓刘吗？你不是到盲人工厂去工作吗？我正是要送您去上班。”
    这是怎么回事呢？原来这孩子他们学校展开了“为人民做一件好事”运动。昨天他上学的时候，在马路上看到一个眼睛不好的叔叔，用拐棍在马路上点来点去地走着。这时候天刚麻亮，路上几乎没有什么人。他就走过去挽着那个叔叔问：“叔叔，您上那儿去？”那个叔叔告诉他上盲人五金工厂去。他就说：“叔叔，我们学校离盲人工厂不远，我可以送您去上班，每天都送。”那个叔叔很感激他，说：“你真是个好孩子！我家天天有人送我，只是今天有事没来。你以后最好去送我们厂里的刘阿姨吧，她每天搭十六路车来，就在前面那个站下车。”接着，又把我的模样告诉了他，所以他今天就来送我了。
    我当然很感动，就说：“你是个好孩子！你叫什么名字？我好告诉你们学校，让大家都知道你的好行为，向你学习。”这孩子本来很爱讲话的，这他可不开口了。我又追问了两遍，他说：“刘阿姨，帮助别人是少先队员应该做的事，用不着让人家知道。我们学校有个同学，他从水里救了两个小娃娃的性命，可是他从来不说，过了两年人家才知道。”
    有个冬天的早上，我爱人告诉我，外面下了很大的雪，我又有点头疼，叫我不要去上班。
    我的爱人走了以后，我心里一直感到不安。我想，那个小朋友一定要到汽车站去接我，可是我没去！……又一想，小朋友要是等不到我，他会自己上学的……
    我正想着，猛听到一个熟悉的、圆润的嗓子叫我：“刘阿姨！刘阿姨在家吗？”呵！原来是那个小朋友！他找到我家来了！我连忙说：“在家。你进房来吧。”他一进房，就气喘喘地说：“阿姨，我在站上没等到您，只当我来得晚，您到工厂去了。我又跑到工厂去问，工厂的人说您没去。我就想，今天下这么大雪，刘阿姨该不会在路上出事吧？所以我问清了您的地址，就上这儿来了……”
    我连忙穿好衣服，摸了几个馍馍装在袋里，就同他出去了。
    前天我下汽车的时候，忽然听到一个小姑娘的声音：“刘阿姨，您早！”接着，就有一只小手挽着我要送我到盲人工厂去。开始时我感到奇怪，经小姑娘一说，才知道她是那个小朋友的妹妹！她告诉我，她的哥哥升了中学，所以送我上班的任务，就交给她了。她哥哥告诉她，现在该她送我，要是她升了中学，送我的任务就交给他们的弟弟。
    我不知道用什么言语来表示我内心的激动。我一心要把这件事写出来，告诉我认识或不认识的每一个人，要写一支赞歌，赞美我们的可爱的孩子，赞美教育他们成长的伟大的母亲——我们的党！
