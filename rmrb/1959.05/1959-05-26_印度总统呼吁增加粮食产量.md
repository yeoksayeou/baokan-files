    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st. Indian President Prasad delivered a radio address to the nation on the evening of the 21st, calling on the entire country to work together to increase summer crop production, just as they did during the winter crop production increase campaign last year.

    India's summer crops, called "Kharif," are mainly rice, which occupies the largest area of the country's food crop regions. The increase campaign launched last winter was limited to provinces planting wheat.

    In order to deal with the food shortage problem and prevent rising grain prices, the government is also trying to increase grain reserves.

    According to the "Hindustan Times" on the 22nd, India needs to import a total of four million tons of grain this year to make up for the deficiency in its own grain production. It has suggested that three million tons of this be imported from the United States.

    印度总统呼吁增加粮食产量
    新华社新德里电  印度总统普拉沙德21日晚向全国发表广播演说，呼吁全国像在去年冬季农作物增产运动中那样，协力增加夏季作物产量。
    印度叫做“哈里夫”的夏季作物主要是水稻，它在这个国家的粮食作物地区所占面积最大。去冬展开的增产运动限于种植小麦的各邦。
    政府为了对付缺粮问题，防止粮价上涨，也在设法增加粮食储备。
    据22日的“印度斯坦时报”报道，印度今年总共需要进口四百万吨粮食以弥补本国粮食生产的不足。它已建议其中的三百万吨粮食从美国进口。
