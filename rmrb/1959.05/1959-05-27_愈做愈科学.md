　　“Boldly mobilize the masses, and go through experimentation in everything,” this is an extremely important experience in promoting new agricultural science and technology during last year’s Great Leap Forward. Now, the Xianhe Cultivation Area of the Hongqi People's Commune in Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, is vigorously carrying out comparative tests of different cultivation methods for various crops, and exploring the rules of how to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" according to local conditions. This is a relatively conscious application and development of the experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward. Using realistic and scientific methods, applying advanced technical measures in line with actual conditions, and effectively guiding and promoting current production, many places have already done so. This marks that our agricultural production work is not only becoming more meticulous, but also more scientific.
　　The task of China's agricultural front is to rapidly increase production in a relatively short period of time, and gradually shift the past thousands of years of backward manual production methods to production equipped with modern science and technology. Under such circumstances, the role of science and technology in agricultural production is becoming more and more important and prominent.
　　However, any new science and technology cannot be promoted and applied on a large scale at the beginning, and needs to go through a process of experimentation and exploration first. Comparison is a good method of scientific experimentation and the most basic method for people to understand objective things. The "Eight-Character Charter" must be applied according to local conditions and time conditions in order to achieve practical results. There are different requirements and results for applying the "Eight-Character Charter" at different times, places, and conditions. For example, different soils have different requirements for deep plowing, and different crop varieties also have different reasonable plant numbers for dense planting. It is necessary to act in accordance with the general laws of the "Eight-Character Charter" and to master the special laws of different crops under different conditions. Delineating small pieces of land to conduct a variety of comparative experiments can yield technical measures that are more in line with local conditions. Then, promoting these advanced measures will naturally be easier to fit with reality.
　　Doing so can also effectively mobilize and educate the masses to understand and believe in science. It is undeniable that, due to the influence of old farming habits for thousands of years, some farmers hold skeptical or even opposing attitudes towards accepting new agricultural technologies to varying degrees. Here, taking a patient persuasive attitude is necessary, and more importantly, making an example for them to see. The broad masses are most trusting of facts and respect truth. The members of the Hongqi Commune in Lezhi County observe and evaluate various comparative tests with great interest. When they see the specific results, their thinking undergoes significant changes. Last year, many members did not believe in the benefits of dense planting, but this year the overwhelming majority of members advocate increasing planting density compared to last year. It can be seen that through purposeful practice, coupled with the necessary improvement of cultural level, the peasant masses can gradually understand science and consciously master science. When the peasant masses consciously master science, agricultural production will bear even more fruitful results.

    愈做愈科学
    苏宜
    “放手发动群众，一切通过试验”，这是去年大跃进中推广新的农业科学技术的极其重要的一条经验。现在四川省乐至县红旗人民公社仙鹤耕作区大搞各种作物不同栽培方法的对比试验，从中摸索如何因地制宜地实行“八字宪法”的规律。这就比较自觉地运用和发展了去年大跃进的经验。用实事求是的科学方法，切合实际地运用先进的技术措施，有效地指导和推动当前的生产，不少地方都已经这样做了。这标志着我们的农业生产工作不仅愈做愈细致，而且愈做愈科学了。
    我国农业战线的任务，是要在比较短的时期内，迅速提高生产，把过去几千年落后的手工方式的生产，逐步转移到用现代科学技术装备起来的生产方面来。在这样的形势下，科学技术在农业生产中的作用愈来愈重要，愈来愈突出了。
    但是，任何新的科学技术，一开始总不能大规模地推广应用，需要先经过试验摸索的过程。对比，是科学试验的好方法，是人们认识客观事物的最基本的方法。“八字宪法”必须因地制宜、因时制宜地运用，才能取得实效。在不同的时间、地点、条件下运用“八字宪法”有不同的要求和结果。譬如不同的土壤有不同的深耕要求，不同的作物品种密植的合理株数也不一样。既要按照“八字宪法”的一般规律办事，又要掌握不同作物不同条件下的特殊规律。划出小块土地，进行多种多样的对比试验，就能得到比较合乎当地条件的技术措施。然后再来推行这些先进措施，自然容易切合实际。
    这样做，还能够有效地动员群众，教育群众来认识科学，相信科学。不可否认，由于几千年来旧的耕作习惯的影响，一部分农民对接受新的农业技术时或多或少地抱着怀疑以至反对的态度。在这里，采取耐心说服的态度是必要的，更重要的是做出样子来给他们看。广大群众是最相信事实、尊重真理的。乐至县红旗公社的社员，就怀着浓厚的兴趣来观察、评比各种对比试验。当他们看到具体结果的时候，思想就起了显著的变化。去年许多社员还不大相信密植的好处，今年占压倒多数的社员主张比去年提高种植密度了。由此可见，通过目的明确的实践，再加上必要的文化水平的提高，农民群众能够逐步地认识科学，自觉地掌握科学。农民群众自觉地掌握了科学，农业生产就会结出更丰硕的果实。
