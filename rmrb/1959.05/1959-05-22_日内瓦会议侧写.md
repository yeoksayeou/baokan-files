Geneva Conference Sketches
    The Importance of Accurate Naming
    A Western reporter at a press conference held by the Soviet delegation asked if this conference was a four-power foreign ministers' meeting. The Soviet spokesperson replied: The name of the meeting is the 1959 Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    Behind this Western reporter's question was an attempt to diminish the significance of the two Germanys' participation in the conference and to block the participation of representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia.
    Fighting for Every Inch
    The tense struggle before the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference resolved the issue of the form of the conference table: The United States originally insisted on a square table, with the delegations of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France each occupying one side, and the delegation of the German Democratic Republic sitting behind the Soviet delegation. This attempt by the United States failed, and the Soviet proposal to use a round table prevailed.
    The U.S. delegation then insisted on adding two rectangular tables, with the representatives of the two Germanys each occupying one, in order to separate the German delegations from the round table. The United States also argued that the distance between the square tables and the round table should be two feet, later retreating to ten inches. Due to strong Soviet opposition, the United States finally had to agree to leave only a very small distance between the round table and the square tables. In reality, it can be said that they were sitting in a circle.
    Was this a struggle over form or a struggle over distance? No, this was a substantive struggle against diminishing the significance of the two Germanys' participation in the conference!
    "Pensioner" in Power
    The current West German Foreign Minister, Heinrich von Brentano, is the head of the West German delegation attending the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    The West German government repeatedly claims to represent Germany, but at this important conference concerning Germany's future, Brentano was not present, and the photographers covering the meeting could not find this gentleman's distinguished appearance at the venue.
    According to reporters familiar with the situation, this minister is conducting "hotel diplomacy," running between the villas and hotels of the Western delegations, engaging in activities to sabotage the conference.
    It is reported that the West German delegation's spokesperson has as many as thirty-five assistants. Those unfamiliar with the situation cannot help but be surprised: What are they here for?
    Business Acumen
    According to Western newspapers, the United States will use the Soviet Union's desire to hold a summit meeting at the Foreign Ministers' Conference as a "bargaining chip," attempting to use this as capital to force the Soviet Union to accept some unreasonable demands from the West.
    To actually be able to use the other party's peaceful desire to resolve international disputes and ease international tensions as one's own bargaining capital!
    Such business acumen!
    "Overproduction"
    Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's speeches are always in short supply, and latecomers often miss out.
    U.S. Secretary of State Herter's speeches are always more than enough, and later they have to lie on the document table, unattended.
    The laws of capitalist economics are also at work here: "Overproduction."
    Living in Yesterday
    A reporter from an American-Hungarian newspaper asked at the Soviet delegation's press conference, "During the Foreign Ministers' Conference, will those refugees who were exiled to Siberia after the Hungarian Incident be able to return home?"
    Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin replied that this gentleman is still living in yesterday. Because when the whole world ignores the slander about the Hungarian Incident, he is still talking nonsense here.

### 日内瓦会议侧写

    日内瓦会议侧写
    必也正名乎
    西方某记者在苏联代表团一个记者招待会上问这次会议是不是四国外长会议。苏联发言人回答说：会议的名字是1959年日内瓦外交部长会议。
    这个西方记者提出这个问题的背后隐藏着这样的企图：贬低两个德国参加会议的意义，并且封闭波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国代表参加会议的大门。
    分寸必争
    在外长会议开幕前的紧张斗争解决了会议桌的形式问题：美国原来坚持用方桌，苏、美、英、法四国代表团各据一方，德意志民主共和国的代表团坐在苏联代表团背后。美国这个企图失败了，苏联关于采用圆桌的主张获胜。
    美国代表团接着又坚持要增加两张长方桌，两个德国的代表各占一张，以便把德国代表团和圆桌隔开。美国并且主张方桌同圆桌的距离为两英尺，后来退让到十英寸。由于苏联坚决反对，美国最后不得不同意圆桌和方桌只留一段极微的距离。实际上可以说坐成了一圈。
  这是形式之争还是距离之争？不，这是反对贬低两个德国参加会议的意义的实质性斗争！
    执政“寓公”
    现任西德外交部长勃伦塔诺是西德出席日内瓦外长会议代表团团长。
    西德政府口口声声自称代表德国，但是在这个关系德国前途的重要会议上，勃伦塔诺却没有出席，采访会议的摄影记者们在会场照不到这位先生的尊容。
    据熟悉内情的记者说，这位部长正在进行“旅馆外交”，奔走于西方代表团的别墅、旅馆之间，进行破坏会议的勾当。
    据悉，西德代表团的发言人竟拥有助手三十五人之多。不明内情的人不胜惊讶：他们所为何来？
    生意经
    据西方报纸报道，美国将在外长会议上利用苏联要求召开首脑会议的愿望作为“讨价还价的杠杆”，企图以此为资本要苏联接受西方的一些无理要求。
    居然能把对方争取解决国际争端以缓和国际紧张局势的和平愿望作为自己讨价还价的资本！
    如此生意经！
    “生产过剩”
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的发言稿总是供不应求，后来者经常向隅。
    美国国务卿赫脱的发言稿却总是绰绰有余，到后来只得躺在文件桌上，无人问津。
    资本主义经济的法则在这里也起着作用：“生产过剩”。
    生活在昨天的人
    美国—匈牙利文报纸的记者在苏联代表团的记者招待会上问，“在外长会议期间，那些在匈牙利事件后被流放到西伯利亚去的难民能不能回家？”
    苏联外交部副部长佐林回答说，这位先生还生活在昨天。因为当全世界都不理会关于匈牙利事件的诬蔑的时候，他还在这里胡说八道。
