Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry issued instructions on the 21st, requiring metallurgical bureaus (departments) of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to take emergency measures to do a good job in the "four protections" work and workers' welfare work, to ensure the smooth passage of small blast furnace production through the rainy season.

The "four protections" work mentioned in the instructions refers to protection against rain, floods, lightning, and heatstroke. Regarding rain protection, the instructions require:

	(1) Do a good job of raw material reserves. It is best to have enough reserves for one month of use, and at least not less than half a month's reserves. (2) Units without raw material warehouses must build simple raw material warehouses or rain shelters. (3) Repair transportation roads to strive for uninterrupted transportation during the rainy season. (4) Units without rain protection facilities at the iron tapping area, furnace top, and worker operating areas should immediately add simple rain protection facilities.

Regarding flood protection, the instructions require: (1) Small blast furnaces near rivers and lakes must build flood control embankments to prevent flooding. (2) Small blast furnaces near mountainous areas must have facilities to prevent mountain floods from impacting them. (3) Small blast furnaces near low-lying areas must do a good job of dredging waterways and drainage to prevent water accumulation from causing harm. (4) All open-pit mines must have drainage facilities (such as establishing drainage ditches, adding necessary water pumps, etc.).

Regarding lightning protection, the instructions require: Small blast furnace power equipment in areas with frequent thunderstorms, such as power transformers, should be equipped with lightning protection equipment to prevent lightning strikes.

Regarding heatstroke prevention, the instructions require: The power equipment used by small blast furnaces, such as transformers and motors, should be strengthened with cooling and ventilation to prevent these devices from being forced to stop production or burn out due to rising temperatures.

The instructions concluded by saying that workers' welfare must be properly arranged, such as resting rooms, rain gear, heatstroke prevention gear, and cooling agents must all be appropriately resolved.

    保证小高炉顺利度过雨季
    冶金部通知各地及早做好四防工作关心职工福利
    新华社22日讯　冶金工业部21日发出指示，要求各省、市、自治区冶金局（厅）采取紧急措施作好四防工作和工人生活福利工作，保证小高炉生产顺利度过雨季。
    指示中提出的“四防”工作是指防雨、防洪、防雷、防暑。在防雨方面，指示要求：
    （1）作好原料储备工作。最好能作到够一个月使用的储备量，最少不能低于半个月的储备量。（2）没有原料仓库的单位，必须建筑简单的原料仓库或原料防雨棚。（3）要修整运输道路，力争在雨季交通不中断。（4）出铁场、炉顶和工人操作地方没有防雨设施的单位，应马上添置简易的防雨设施。
    在防洪方面，指示要求：（1）靠近江河湖泊附近的小高炉，必须修好防洪堤坝，防止水淹。（2）靠近山区的小高炉，必须有防止山洪冲击的设施。（3）靠近地势低洼地区的小高炉，必须作好疏通水道和排水等工作，以防积水为害。（4）凡是露天开采的矿山，必须有排水设施（如建立排水沟、增加必要的水泵等）。
    在防暑方面，指示要求：对雷雨较多地区的小高炉电源设备，如电源变压器等安装避雷设备以防雷击。
    在防暑方面，指示要求：小高炉所用动力设备，如变压器、电动机等需加强冷却通风工作，以防这些设备由于温度升高而被迫停产或烧坏。
    指示最后说，对工人的生活福利，必须安置妥当，如休息室、防雨用具、防暑用具、清冷剂等都必须适当解决。
