    Bengbu Prefecture transplants spring tobacco
    Hefei, May 16th (Our Dispatch) - Bengbu Prefecture, which accounts for more than 90% of Anhui Province's flue-cured tobacco production area, in order to further increase flue-cured tobacco production on the basis of achieving an average yield of more than 220 jin per mu last year, in addition to appropriately expanding the planting area, will continue to vigorously improve the yield per unit area.
    This prefecture plans to plant more than 500,000 mu of tobacco this year, which will be an expansion of more than 100,000 mu compared to last year. According to past experience proving that earlier planting results in higher yields, in more than 200,000 mu of spring tobacco land throughout the prefecture, most areas carried out deep plowing one to three times last winter, to a depth of about one chi. Due to the widespread selection of improved varieties, warm bed seedling cultivation, and deep plowing with sufficient base fertilizer in the seedbeds, the seedlings are now growing stout and strong, with early-cultivated spring tobacco seedlings already having more than eight true leaves. Currently, the transplanting of spring tobacco seedlings has generally begun. (Li Xiangren)

    蚌埠专区移栽春烟
    本报合肥16日电　占安徽省烤烟生产面积90％以上的蚌埠专区，为了在去年获得全专区平均亩产二百二十多斤的丰产基础上进一步增加烤烟产量，除适当扩大播种面积外，将继续大力提高单位面积产量。
    这个专区今年计划植烟五十多万亩，将比去年扩大十多万亩。根据往年证明栽得早产量高的经验，全区二十多万亩春烟地，大部分在去冬就普遍深耕一至三次，深度在一尺左右。由于普遍选用良种，温床育苗，苗床地耕的深基肥足，现在幼苗都长得又肥又壮，早育的春烟苗已有八片以上真叶。目前，春烟苗已普遍开始移栽。　（李祥仁）
