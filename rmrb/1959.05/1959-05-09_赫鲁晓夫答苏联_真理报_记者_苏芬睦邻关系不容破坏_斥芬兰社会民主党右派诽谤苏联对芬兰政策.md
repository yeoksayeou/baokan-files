Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. TASS reports: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, regarding the recent statements of the Finnish Social Democratic right wing, said to a "Pravda" reporter: Soviet-Finnish relations are a clear example of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries with different social systems. He believes that the statements of Donner, Leskinen, Pietinen, and other Social Democratic right-wing figures who attempt to slander Soviet policy toward Finland are malicious fabrications motivated by a desire to worsen Soviet-Finnish relations.

Khrushchev made these remarks in response to questions posed by a "Pravda" reporter. His answers were published in the May 8th edition of "Pravda."

Khrushchev said that the good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland are not to the liking of certain imperialist groups outside Finland, who are constantly thinking of using the country, as in the past, to achieve their aggressive goals. Everyone is well aware that the likes of Donner do not reflect the interests of the Finnish people. They serve primarily the West, especially those across the ocean, who desperately want Soviet-Finnish relations to deteriorate, hoping to drag Finland into their military-political alliances and force it to implement policies that are completely contrary to its national interests.

Khrushchev pointed out that although the likes of Donner want to speak in the name of the Social Democrats, the Soviets are well aware that these people are far from representing the Finnish Social Democratic Party. He said that we know that the majority of the Finnish Social Democratic Party supports a policy of friendship with the Soviet Union.

    赫鲁晓夫答苏联“真理报”记者
    苏芬睦邻关系不容破坏
    斥芬兰社会民主党右派诽谤苏联对芬兰政策
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫就芬兰社会民主党右派不久以前发表的言论对“真理报”记者说：苏芬关系是社会制度不同的国家实行平等互利合作的鲜明范例。他认为，唐纳、勒斯基宁、皮特辛基和其他企图诽谤苏联对芬兰政策的社会民主党右派人士的言论，是一些恶意的捏造，其动机是想恶化芬苏关系。
    赫鲁晓夫是在回答“真理报”记者所提出的问题时说这番话的。他的回答刊载在8日的“真理报”上。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏芬两国的睦邻关系不合芬兰国外的某些帝国主义集团的心意，而这些人念念不忘地想要像过去一样利用这个国家来实现自己的侵略目的。每个人都很清楚，唐纳之流并不反映芬兰人民的利益。他们首先是为西方、特别是为大洋彼岸的这样一些人服务：这些人巴不得芬苏关系恶化，指望把芬兰拖入自己的军事政治联盟，迫使它执行完全同它的民族利益背道而驰的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，尽管唐纳之流想用社会民主党的名义讲话，但是苏联人很清楚，这些人远不能代表芬兰社会民主党。他说，我们知道，芬兰社会民主党的大多数人是支持同苏联友好的政策的。
