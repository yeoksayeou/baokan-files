Reflections on the 40th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement
Xiao San

Forty years ago today, I came to Tiananmen Square. The Tiananmen of that time, ah,
	Old, gloomy, and gray, with two great mountains weighing down its shoulders… But that day was unlike any other, people's hearts stirred like waves on a vast sea. Five thousand small white flags—an endless expanse. Five thousand people shouted slogans that shook the heavens: Oppose the shameless division of spoils at Versailles! We must break the twenty-one chains! The entire Shandong is Chinese territory, and we will never allow foreigners to invade!

Forty years later, today, I stand again in Tiananmen Square. Today's Tiananmen, ah,
	Glorious, brilliant, and solemn, standing firmly on the front lines of defending peace. Five hundred thousand people stride past, ten thousand red flags caressing the blue sky. Five hundred thousand people sing aloud: Six hundred and fifty million people celebrate a great reunion. In the cheers, a roar erupts: Tibet is a part of China! The Chinese people will manage Chinese affairs, and we will never allow foreigners to interfere in our internal affairs!

British imperialism and Indian expansionism—this is the true “mother-child relationship.” As for us and the Tibetan people, we have always been brothers. We will build a true paradise on earth on the roof of the world. The two great mountains of Tibet must also be moved away, even if it is as difficult as moving the Himalayas!

Listen, all imperialists and expansionists: We have a tradition and experience in opposing imperialism and feudalism.
 “If you throw dust at the sun, you will only blind your own eyes!”
(Note) The last sentence is an Indian proverb

    “五四”四十周年有感
    萧三四十年前的今天，我来到了天安门前。那时的天安门呵，
        古老、阴森、灰暗，两座大山压住了它的双肩……但是那一天不比平常，人心激动似大海起了波浪。五千杆小白旗——一片汪洋。五千人喊口号震天价响：反对凡尔赛的无耻分赃！我们要打断二十一条锁链！整个山东是中国的疆土，决不容许外国人侵占！四十年后的今天我又站在天安门前。今天的天安门呵，
        光辉、灿烂、庄严，屹立在保卫和平的最前线。五十万人大踏步走过，万树红旗抚拭着蓝天。五十万人高声歌唱：六亿五千万人民庆大团圆。欢呼声中发出了怒吼：西藏是中国的一部分！中国人的事中国人来管，决不许外国人干涉我内政！英帝国主义和印度扩张主义——这才是真正的“母子关系”。至于我们和藏族人民历来就是骨肉兄弟。我们要在世界屋脊上面建设真正的人间乐园。西藏的两座大山也要搬开，哪怕像搬喜马拉雅那样困难！一切帝国主义和扩张主义者听吧：反帝反封建我们有传统，有经验。
  “你们要向太阳扔掷尘土，只有弄瞎自己的双眼！”
