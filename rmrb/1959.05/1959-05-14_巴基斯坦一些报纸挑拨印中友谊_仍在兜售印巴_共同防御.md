Xinhua News Agency, 13th Karachi dispatch: Some Pakistani newspapers published editorials on the 12th, exaggerating President Ayub Khan's so-called "joint defense" proposal to India again in his speech in Quetta on May 10, and inciting discord in Sino-Indian friendship.

According to a report in today's "Karachi Times," Pakistani Minister of Commerce, Bhutto, explained Ayub Khan's so-called "joint defense" proposal in Quetta on the 12th. Bhutto said that Ayub Khan believed that "if India feels it must join the treaty organization to establish a joint defense system, he (Ayub Khan) is willing to relieve their (India's) worries and reassure them (India)." Bhutto further explained that Pakistan "can consider cooperating with each other without the form of a convention or treaty," and that "there is no need to enter into some kind of formal written agreement."

The "Achievement" newspaper published an editorial on Ayub Khan's proposal, clamoring that "the threat of China" is looming over India's head. The newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Nehru's rejection of Ayub Khan's proposal for "joint defense." In a complaining tone, it said, "Because the Indian authorities' hearts are burning with hatred and hostility towards Pakistan, they cannot tolerate Pakistan's cooperation, even for India's defense."

The newspaper attempted to use euphemistic words to entice India into aggressive military blocs. It said that after India and Pakistan decide on a "joint defense policy," if Pakistan is "involved in a war due to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, India is free to pursue a policy of neutrality." "But if India is attacked by any foreign country, Pakistan will use all its military strength to help India."

The "Battle" newspaper even more viciously distorted the facts and incited discord, saying that the Chinese government's pacification of the Tibetan rebellion was a "red storm aimed at India."

The "Comment" evening newspaper, because the so-called "joint defense" proposal was rejected by the Indian government, turned its hopes to the Indian People's Socialist Party and other socialists. The newspaper complained in its editorial on the 12th that Prime Minister Nehru "has no intention of amicably resolving the Kashmir and canal water issues," and it attacked Prime Minister Nehru, saying with dissatisfaction, "There is reason to believe that as long as Mr. Nehru is in power, Pakistan cannot expect India to act fairly."

The newspaper believes that "if the socialists come to power in India, then—and only then—can the era of establishing harmonious relations between India and Pakistan begin."

### 巴基斯坦一些报纸挑拨印中友谊  仍在兜售印巴“共同防御”

    巴基斯坦一些报纸挑拨印中友谊
    仍在兜售印巴“共同防御”
    新华社13日讯  卡拉奇消息：巴基斯坦一些报纸在12日发表社论，渲染阿尤布汗总统5月10日在基达的讲话中再次向印度提出的所谓“共同防御”建议，并且挑拨印中友谊。
    据“卡拉奇时报”今天报道，巴基斯坦商业部长巴托12日在基达解释了阿尤布汗这个所谓“共同防御”的建议。巴托说，阿尤布汗认为，“如果印度认为它必须加入条约组织以建立共同防御体系，他（阿尤布汗）愿意解除他们（印度）的忧虑和使他们（印度）安心”。巴托又解释说，巴基斯坦“可以考虑不用订立公约或条约的形式而互相进行合作”，而且“不必订立某种正式的书面协定”。
    “成就报”就阿尤布汗的建议发表社论叫嚷说，“中国的威胁”正笼罩在印度的头顶。这家报纸对尼赫鲁总理拒绝阿尤布汗关于“共同防御”的建议表示不满。它以抱怨的语调说，“由于印度当局的心中燃烧着憎恨和敌视巴基斯坦的火焰，他们不能忍受巴基斯坦的合作，即使是为了印度的防务。”
    这家报纸企图用委婉动听的言词来诱使印度卷入侵略性的军事集团。它说，在印度和巴基斯坦决定“共同防御的政策”以后，如果巴基斯坦由于东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约“而卷入战争，印度可自由奉行中立政策”。“但是如果印度受到任何一个外国的进攻，巴基斯坦将用它的全部军事力量来帮助印度。”
      “战斗报”更恶毒地歪曲事实并进行挑拨，它说，中国政府平息西藏叛乱是“针对印度的红色风暴”。
      “评论”晚报由于所谓“共同防御”的建议遭到印度政府的拒绝，便把希望转到印度人民社会党人和其他社会党人的身上。这家报纸在12日的社论中埋怨尼赫鲁总理“没有意思友好地解决克什米尔和运河河水问题”，它并且攻击尼赫鲁总理，它不满意地说，“可以有理由认为，只要尼赫鲁先生当政，巴基斯坦不能指望印度能够公平行事。”
    这家报纸认为，“如果社会党人在印度上了台，到那时候——也只有到那时候——印度同巴基斯坦建立融洽关系的时代才能开始。”
