The southern rivers are about to enter the flood season, and the 1959 flood control work should be intensified. Recently, the Central Flood Control Headquarters held this year's National Flood Control Conference in Beijing. The conference called on all localities to take active action and make all preparations before the flood season as soon as possible to ensure that water conservancy projects safely pass the flood season, and to maximize the role of all completed projects in resisting floods and droughts, and to overcome floods. More than 100 people, including directors, directors, bureau chiefs, engineers of water conservancy departments of provinces (cities), regions, river basins and relevant departments of the central government, attended the meeting.

During the meeting, Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, summoned the Military Commission, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Interior, the Fifth and Seventh Offices of the State Council, the Planning Commission, the Economic Commission and other relevant central departments and representatives attending the meeting, made speeches to them, and studied and solved some specific problems in the preparation of flood control.

The Flood Control Conference pointed out that the flood control situation this year is unprecedentedly favorable. In the past years, especially since the great leap forward in water conservancy, a large number of water conservancy projects have been built in various places, and the flood control capacity of the embankments of major rivers has been enhanced. Many small and medium-sized rivers that have been seriously harmful have also been improved to varying degrees. These projects, coupled with the rich experience accumulated in flood control struggles over the years, and the improvement of mass awareness after the people's communeization, have formed an unprecedentedly favorable new situation for this year's flood control struggle. However, the new situation also puts forward new tasks: in order to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the standards for flood control and drainage must be raised this year, and the scope of flood control must also be expanded.

The meeting examined the problems in the flood control preparation work in various places. Due to the tight labor force last winter and this spring, many old projects have not been repaired annually; the newly built projects have not been tested by floods; some of the projects started last winter cannot be completed before the flood season this year; in areas suffering from drought, there are cases of blocking rivers and building dams, and digging embankments to release water. At the same time, after the people's communeization, the old grassroots flood control organizations in many areas were disrupted, and new organizations have not been established in time. Many of the flood control materials accumulated over the years in various places were transferred last year. These problems urgently need to be resolved before the flood season.

The rainy season in the south has arrived earlier this spring, and the flood season tends to be earlier. The meeting called on all localities to be vigilant and make all preparations before the flood season as soon as possible: immediately check water conservancy projects, and repair old projects that have not been repaired annually; pay special attention to the quality of new projects; if the unfinished projects can be completed before the flood season according to needs and possibilities, they should be stepped up and resolutely guaranteed to be completed; for projects that cannot be completed before the flood season, if it is dangerous to continue repairing them and should be stopped, they should be stopped as soon as possible. Some rivers that have been blocked to build dams during drought relief must be dismantled before the flood season, and the breaches dug on the embankments should also be plugged in time. At the same time, all localities must continue to implement the principle of "emphasizing storage, overall arrangement, and comprehensive utilization", make unified arrangements for floods, combine disaster elimination and benefit in ensuring the safety of projects, and consider the issue of flood control and water storage in a unified manner. The meeting also called on all localities to strengthen hydrological forecasting work, and flood control agencies should be quickly restored. On the principle of taking local materials and self-reliance, quickly raise sufficient flood control and rescue materials, and make arrangements for the manpower required for repairing work, flood control, and rescue.

    全国防汛会议要求各地
    加紧作好汛前准备工作
    本报讯　南方江河即将进入汛期，1959年的防汛工作，应加紧进行。最近中央防汛总指挥部在北京召开了今年的全国防汛会议，会议要求各地积极行动起来，及早作好汛前的一切准备工作，保证水利工程安度汛期，并且使各项已完工程在抗御水旱灾害方面发挥最大的作用，战胜洪水。参加会议的有各省（市）区、流域水利部门的主任、厅、局长、工程师及中央各有关部门等共一百多人。
    会议期间，国务院副总理、中央防汛总指挥部主任邓子恢召集了军委、交通部、铁道部、农业部、林业部、商业部、粮食部、内务部、国务院五办、七办、计委、经委等中央有关部门和参加会议的代表，向他们作了讲话，并研究解决防汛准备工作中的一些具体问题。
    防汛会议指出：今年防汛的形势空前有利。历年来特别自从水利大跃进以来，各地兴修了大量水利工程，大江大河方面的堤防防洪能力增强了，许多为害严重的中小河流，也都有不同程度的改善。这些工程，加上历年来在防汛斗争中积累的丰富经验，再加上人民公社化后群众觉悟的提高，形成了今年防汛斗争的空前有利的新形势。但是，新的情况也提出了新的任务：为了适应工农业大跃进的需要，今年防洪除涝的标准必须提高，防汛的范围也扩大了。
    会议检查了各地防汛准备工作中的问题。由于去冬今春劳力紧张，许多老工程没有进行岁修；新建的工程未经过洪水考验；去年冬天开工的工程在今年汛前有的不能完成；在闹旱的地方，有拦河打坝、扒堤放水的情况。同时，人民公社化后，不少地区旧的基层防汛组织被打乱，新的组织还未及时建立起来，各地历年积存的防汛物料，去年有很多被调用。这些问题都迫切需要在汛前得到解决。
    今春南方雨季提前，汛期有提早的趋势。会议要求各地提高警惕，及早作好汛前的一切准备工作：立即检查水利工程，对于未经岁修的老工程要加以补修；对于新工程特别要注意质量；未完工程按需要和可能可以在汛前完成的，要抓紧进行，坚决保证完成；对于汛前不能完成的工程，如果继续修下去有危险而应当停下来的，要及早停下来。有些河道在抗旱时拦河打坝的，汛前必须拆除的一定要拆除，堤上扒的口子也应当按时堵好。同时，各地必须继续贯彻“以蓄为主，全面安排，综合利用”的方针，对于洪水作统一的安排，在确保工程安全的条件下，使除害与兴利结合起来，统一考虑拦洪与蓄水问题。会议还要求各地加强水文预报工作，应迅速恢复办起防汛机构。按就地取材、自力更生的原则迅速筹足防汛抢险物资，并对修工、防汛、抢险所需要的人力做好安排。（附图片）
