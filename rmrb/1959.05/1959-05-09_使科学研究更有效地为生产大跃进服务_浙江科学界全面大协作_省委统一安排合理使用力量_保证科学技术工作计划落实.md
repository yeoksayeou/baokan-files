To make scientific research serve the Great Leap Forward in production more effectively
Comprehensive collaboration in Zhejiang's scientific community
Provincial Party Committee Unified Arrangements for Rational Use of Forces to Ensure the Implementation of Scientific and Technological Work Plans

(Our reporter Tu Zhengfeng reports) Since the beginning of this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has strengthened its leadership over scientific and technological research work. It has organized province-wide collaboration in scientific and technological research. For important research projects, it has adopted the "six fixed" method (namely, fixing the department responsible for researching each project, the time, the personnel, collaborators, as well as measures and quality for completing the plan) to ensure that the province's scientific and technological work plan for this year is implemented on a reliable basis, and to strive to make greater contributions to the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

In 1958, after rectification, scientific and technological workers throughout Zhejiang Province liberated their thinking, and their enthusiasm was unprecedentedly brought into play. The number of projects proposed for research and completion greatly increased compared with 1957. However, in some places, some scientific and technological units and individuals did not do a good job of collaboration among themselves and with relevant industrial departments. Key issues in production that needed to be solved urgently were either missed and no one went to study them, or the effectiveness was not great because the research force was not well organized and brought into play. According to the investigation by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the twenty-one key research projects proposed in the plans of various units at the end of last year, a total of twenty-nine main research units participated in these projects. Among them, some projects could not be completed by one unit alone, and units chose the same project without prior consultation and without communicating with each other. The minimum number of units researching a single project was two to three, the general number was five to six, and the maximum number was ten. Because they did not collaborate, the work progressed slowly. In order to improve this year's scientific and technological work, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has, since January this year, while formulating this year's scientific and technological work plan, seized the opportunity to mobilize scientific and technological research departments, institutions of higher learning, and relevant industrial departments to carry out extensive collaboration. It first convened a meeting of leading personnel from relevant provincial departments, bureaus, institutions of higher learning, and larger research institutes, factories, and mines to review the Zhejiang Province's 1959 Scientific and Technological Development Plan (draft). Then, the various specialized departments, bureaus, and research institutions convened expanded party committee meetings and scientific and technological work meetings according to their specialties to discuss and divide specific research projects and technical measures. After item-by-item and topic-by-topic discussions and reviews, research projects were categorized into three types based on unified understanding: immediate action, preparation for action, and postponement of action, according to the specific circumstances. At the same time, the sponsoring unit, person in charge, completion time, collaborating units, specific measures, and quality requirements for each research project were affirmed at the collaboration contract meeting. At present, 238 topics have been implemented through this "six fixed" research plan. The implementation of these projects has played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the four major indicators. For example, at the collaboration meeting, the Metallurgical Department pointed out that the technical key to steel production is to rapidly improve the quality and quantity of smelting, and the main problem in quality is the high sulfur content. Therefore, it is urgent to solve the "desulfurization" problem technically. In terms of raw materials, it is necessary to ensure the supply of iron ore, coke, and limestone, and the urgent need is to solve the supply of coke. It is required that the coke has low ash content, low sulfur content, and good mechanical properties. Zhejiang University had stopped the hot-pressed coke experiment due to the lack of coal for testing. Through mutual introductions, collaboration was immediately agreed upon. In this way, not only can Zhejiang University's research work proceed smoothly, but also the technical problem of pressing coal with poor coking performance into good coke, increasing the source of coke, and the technical research plan for coal blending, coal washing, and crushing particle size, which the Metallurgical Department urgently requested, have also been implemented. For example, the Zhejiang Chemical Industry Research Institute completed more than 400 research problems last year, but it did not pay enough attention to the current key to production in Zhejiang's chemical industry, which is to increase the output and quality of three acids and two alkalis. At this collaboration meeting, the research plan for this year was revised, and it was further clarified that the key to breaking through the three acids and two alkalis is to solve the indigenous method of sulfur solidification technology, reduce the amount of nitric acid used, and increase the concentration. The Chemical Industry Research Institute listed this project as the first of the immediate action category. In order to obtain research results as soon as possible for the Chemical Department to organize and promote, the Department of Chemical Engineering of Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Chemical Industry College were invited to collaborate in research. Through the meeting, the Agricultural Science Research Institute clarified the research direction of this year's technical research and the innovation of agricultural tools to improve productivity, focusing on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." On the one hand, it collaborated with the Department of Agriculture to actively organize forces to summarize and promote the agricultural high-yield experience created by the masses in 1958. On the other hand, it organized agricultural technical forces in various professional areas and counties to conduct research on yield-increasing measures centered on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."

Through the organization of comprehensive collaboration, this year's scientific and technological research work in Zhejiang Province has not only achieved comprehensive development in industry, agriculture, medicine, and science, but also made key arrangements around the four major indicators; it has not only emphasized solving the key production problems that need to be solved urgently in current production, but also paid attention to the research work on scientific theories that can open up new avenues for production. These can be seen in the main tasks put forward by Zhejiang Province for revising this year's scientific and technological development plan: In industry, it is first emphasized that it is necessary to break through the smelting technology of steel, iron, copper, etc. in the iron and steel industry; break through the keys of machinery manufacturing, coal, and chemical industry production to drive the greater leap forward of industries such as electricity, transportation, and construction. In agriculture, it is emphasized that it is necessary to systematically summarize new agricultural high-yield technologies and the experience of fast-growing and high-yield timber forests, oil tea, bamboo, tea, and mulberry; the application of artificial rainfall in production and the high-energy food substitute—small ball algae culture experiment, marine resource survey, artificial breeding of freshwater fish fry, and the research on expanding resource comprehensive utilization to promote production development. In terms of medicine and health, it is required to conscientiously summarize the research of traditional Chinese medicine, develop the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, promote the cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine, control and eliminate diseases that seriously endanger the health of the people, actively carry out research on factory and mine hygiene and commune hygiene, and carry out mass health campaigns. In addition, in order to lay the foundation for the development of modern cutting-edge science and technology, the main tasks also emphasize the need to carry out cutting-edge scientific research and key trial manufacturing; under the continued implementation of the policy of combining theory with practice, actively carry out the research of basic theory.

After being organized for collaboration, the scientific and technological workers of the province have made remarkable achievements in the research of desulfurization to improve steel quality because the forces have been rationally used and the enthusiasm and creativity have been better brought into play.

　　使科学研究更有效地为生产大跃进服务
    浙江科学界全面大协作
    省委统一安排合理使用力量　保证科学技术工作计划落实
    本报讯　记者屠正峰报道：今年以来，中共浙江省委加强了对科学技术研究工作的领导。组织全省科学技术研究大协作，对于重要的研究项目，采取“六定”的办法（即定负责研究各项目的部门、时间、人、协作者，以及完成计划的措施、质量），保证今年全省科学技术工作的计划落实在可靠的基础上，力争为工农业生产大跃进作出更大的贡献。
    在1958年，浙江全省科学技术工作者经过整风，解放了思想，积极性获得空前的发挥，提出研究以及完成的项目，比1957年大大增加。但是，有的地方有些科学技术单位和个人相互之间，以及他们与各有关产业部门之间，没有搞好协作，对生产中迫待解决的关键性问题，不是漏掉了没人去研究，就是因为研究的力量没很好组织和发挥作用，成效不大。据中共浙江省委对去年年底各单位所提出今年规划中二十一个重点研究项目的调查，参加这些项目研究的共二十九个主要研究单位，其中不是一个单位所能完成、不约而同选择同一项目、而又互不通气的，一个项目最少的有二个到三个单位去研究它，一般的是五个到六个单位，最多的有十个单位，他们因没有协作，工作进展缓慢。中共浙江省委为了改进今年的科学技术工作，从今年1月份以来，在制订今年科学技术工作规划的同时，就抓紧发动各科学技术研究部门、高等院校，以及各有关产业部门大协作。先召开了省属有关厅、局、高等院校和较大的研究所、厂矿企业等领导人员会议，审查了浙江省1959年的科学技术发展计划（草案）。然后各专业厅、局和研究机构等又根据专业分别召开了党委扩大会和科学技术工作会议，进行具体研究项目与技术措施的商讨与分工。经过逐项、逐题的讨论和审查后，对生产中一般性的问题，研究条件不具备的项目，或者有许多单位不约而同选择了同一研究题的，在统一认识的基础上，将研究项目排队，分为马上行动、准备行动和暂缓行动三类，依照具体情况进行研究工作。同时将每一项研究项目的主办单位、负责人、完成的时间、协作单位、具体措施和质量要求都在协作合同会上肯定下来。目前，通过这样“六定”落实的研究计划已有二百三十八个课题。这些项目的落实，对保证完成四大指标起了很大作用。如在协作会上，冶金厅提出在钢铁生产方面的技术关键是必须迅速提高冶炼中的质量和数量，而在质量上主要的问题是含硫量太高，因此在技术上迅速要求解决“脱硫”问题。在原料上要求保证铁矿石、焦、石灰石的供应，而其中急需解决的是焦的供应。要求焦内含灰分少、含硫量低、机械性能好。而浙江大学正因为缺乏试验用煤，停止了热压焦的试验，通过双方介绍，立即约定了协作。这样，不仅浙大的研究工作可以顺利进行，冶金厅迫切要求要结焦性能差的煤压成好焦，增加焦的来源的技术问题和配煤、洗煤、粉碎颗粒等技术研究计划也落实了。又如浙江化学工业研究所去年完成了四百多项研究问题，但针对浙江化工当前生产关键，提高三酸两碱的产量与质量问题却注意得不够，这次协作会上修订了今年的研究计划，进一步明确了突破三酸两碱关键中的关键是解决土法结硫技术，降低硝酸用量，提高浓度。化学工业研究所就将这个项目列入马上行动的第一类。为了尽快得出研究成果，以供化工厅组织推广，并邀请浙江大学化工系和浙江化工专科学校协作一起研究。农业科学研究所通过会议对今年以农业“八字宪法”为中心的技术研究和革新农具提高生产率的研究方向更明确了，一面与农业厅协作积极组织力量总结与推广1958年群众创造的农业丰产经验。一面组织各专业区及各县农业技术力量以农业“八字宪法”为中心分头进行增产措施的研究。
    通过组织全面大协作的安排，今年浙江省的科学技术研究工作既有工、农、医、理全面的发展，也围绕四大指标作了重点的安排；既强调了解决当前生产中急需解决的生产关键问题，也注意了能够为生产开辟新途径的科学理论的研究工作。这些在浙江省对修订今年科学技术发展计划提出的主要任务中就可以看出：在工业中，首先强调了要突破钢铁工业中提高钢、铁、铜等的冶炼技术；突破机械制造、煤炭和化学工业生产的关键来带动电力、交通和建筑等方面的工业更大地跃进。在农业上，强调了要系统地总结农业丰产新技术和用材林、油茶、毛竹、茶、桑的速生丰产经验；人工降雨在生产上的应用和高能量食粮代用品——小球藻培养试验、海洋资源调查、人工繁殖淡水鱼苗以及扩大资源综合利用促进生产发展的研究。医药卫生方面要求认真总结祖国医药的研究，发展祖国医药遗产，促进中西医合作，控制和消灭严重危害人民健康的疾病，积极开展厂矿卫生和公社卫生的研究工作，开展群众性的卫生运动。此外，为发展现代最新科学技术打下基础，在主要任务中也强调了要求开展尖端科学研究和重点试制工作；在继续贯彻执行理论与实际相结合的方针下，积极开展基本理论的研究工作。
    全省科学技术工作者经过组织协作以后，因为力量获得了合理的使用，积极性和创造性获得了更好的发挥，如在脱硫以提高钢质量方面的研究，已经取得显著的成就。
