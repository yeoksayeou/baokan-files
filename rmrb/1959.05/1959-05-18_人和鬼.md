    People and Ghosts
    Wu Han
    In the past, people were superstitious and believed in ghosts.

    It is said that ghosts are like people, with good ghosts and evil ghosts. There are big ghosts, small ghosts, male ghosts, female ghosts, good-looking ghosts, ugly ghosts, refined ghosts, martial ghosts, and even big-headed ghosts, hanged ghosts, and so on. In short, everything that exists in the human world also exists in the ghost world.

    With ghost stories, there are naturally books about ghosts. From the *Ling Gui Zhi* quoted in the *Taiping Guangji*, to the *Taiping Yulan*, the *Taiping Guangji* both have several volumes specifically about ghosts. During the Qing Dynasty, there were several people who particularly liked telling ghost stories, one was Pu Songling, who wrote *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*, another was Ji Xiaolan, who wrote *Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations*, and there was also Yuan Zicai, who also liked telling ghost stories.

    The ghosts in the writings of Pu Songling and Ji Xiaolan come in all shapes and sizes, with all kinds of temperaments. Some of the ghosts are written so well that they are very likable. They use ghost stories to satirize and educate the living, speaking ghost language, but actually speaking human language. They also write about some living people who look like living people, but speak ghost language and do ghost things.

    Generally speaking, although ghosts are transformed from people, and people become ghosts after death, people are still afraid of ghosts. On the other hand, although people are afraid of ghosts, they also like to listen to ghost stories.

    The reason for fear is that ghosts are said to want to be reborn as people. Before a ghost who died unjustly is reborn, they must find a substitute to turn a person into a ghost. Because of this, people are afraid when talking about ghosts, let alone seeing them. Conversely, it is said that people become ghosts after death, and people and ghosts are ultimately related. Having no personal experience of being a ghost, it is good to hear about it from others, so people like to listen to ghost stories, probably for reference.

    Since the advent of scientific knowledge, since the advent of materialism, people who understand science and materialism no longer believe in ghosts. However, studying some past ghost stories to understand the social aspects of that era is still somewhat beneficial.

    Moreover, while dead ghosts do not exist, living ghosts certainly do! They bare their fangs and claws to eat people all day long, frighten people with their green faces and sharp teeth, manipulate people with their ghostly minds, ghostly ideas, ghostly behaviors, and ghostly companions. In short, a small group of living ghosts are making waves, creating rumors, spreading gossip, creating tension, and putting on a ghostly front with ghostly authority. The more you fear them, the more ruthless they become, determined to devour you.

    The way to deal with living ghosts is to shout loudly, "You are a ghost!" Expose them, let everyone know that this is a ghost. Drag the ghost into the sunlight, expose their tricks and schemes, let people recognize the ghost's appearance, name, relatives, and friends. When the ghost is isolated among the people, they will not be able to do ghostly things, or they will become human, or they will really become ghosts, which is fine as far as we are concerned.

    To deal with living ghosts, you must first not be afraid of ghosts. The principle is that if you are not afraid, they will be afraid. Here are a few ghost stories that are very interesting.

    The first is *Qing Feng* written by Pu Songling. It tells the story of a wild scholar named Geng Qubing, who heard that there was a haunted mansion in ruins, where the hall doors would open and close by themselves, and sometimes there would be sounds of laughter, singing, and music. He moved his bedding in to live there and studied downstairs. One night, while he was studying hard, a disheveled ghost came in, his face as black as lacquer, smiling at him with wide eyes. Geng Qubing also smiled at him and casually smeared his face with ink from the inkstone, staring at him face to face. The ghost saw that something was wrong, and slipped away with a face full of shame.

    The second is the *Hanged Ghost* written by Ji Xiaolan. It says that there was a man named Cao who lived in a house. In the middle of the night, something came in through the crack in the door, like a piece of paper, and turned into a human shape, a woman. He was not afraid at all. The ghost then let down her hair and stuck out her tongue, making the appearance of a hanged ghost. He laughed and said, "Hair is still hair, just a little messy, and the tongue is still a tongue, just a little longer, what's so scary?" The ghost then took off her head and put it on the table. He laughed and said, "I'm not even afraid of a head, let alone no head?" The ghost had no choice and disappeared. Later, he lived in this house again, and the door crack sounded again in the middle of the night. As soon as it poked its head in, he shouted, "It's this annoying thing again!" As soon as the ghost heard this, it had no choice but to not come in.

    Another is about a big ghost. It is said that a certain ancestor of Dai Dongyuan was bold and not afraid of ghosts. He moved into an empty house. At night, the wind was cold and miserable, and a big ghost came out and said, "Are you really not afraid?" He answered, "Not afraid." The big ghost made many evil faces and asked again, "Still not afraid?" He answered, "Of course." The big ghost had no choice but to say politely, "I don't necessarily have to drive you away, as long as you say you are afraid, I will leave." He said, "That's absurd, I'm really not afraid, how can I tell a lie. Do what you want." The ghost pleaded again and again, but he ignored it. The ghost had no choice but to sigh and say, "I have been here for more than thirty years and have never seen a stubborn person like you. How can such a fool live together? I have no choice but to leave."

    Another is about a big-eyed ghost. Xu Nanjin from Nanpi was very brave and studied in a monastery. In the middle of the night, two lights suddenly appeared on the wall. Upon closer inspection, it was a large face, and the two lights were a pair of big eyes. He said, "Perfect, I need light to study, and my candles are gone." He leaned a book against the wall, sat down, and began to recite aloud. After reciting a few pages, the lights disappeared. He knocked on the wall and called out, but it didn't come out. One night, he went to the toilet, and a child was holding a candle for him. Unexpectedly, the big-eyed ghost came out again, smiling at him. The child was so frightened that he fell to the ground. He picked up the candle and put it on the big-eyed ghost's head, saying, "There is no candlestick, you're just right." The big-eyed ghost looked up, unmoving. He also said, "Where else could you go, why did you have to come here! I heard that there are people who specialize in driving away bad places, you must be one of them. I can't let you down." He casually grabbed a used piece of toilet paper and wiped the ghost's mouth. The big-eyed ghost vomited violently, roared a few times, and disappeared. It never came again.

    These few stories are very good, showing contempt, disdain, and hatred for all kinds of ghosts, which is completely reasonable. When human spirit is strong, ghostly spirit declines; when people are not afraid of ghosts, ghosts are afraid of people.

    Not only should we treat dead ghosts this way, but we should also treat living ghosts this way.

    People should not be superstitious, but should believe in science and respect science. However, it is also worthwhile to study ghost stories and learn from them. We should read more books that speak human language, and I think it is also worthwhile to read books that speak ghost language.

    人和鬼
    吴晗
    在过去的时代里，人们讲迷信，相信有鬼。
    据说鬼也和人一样，有好鬼，有恶鬼。有大鬼，小鬼，男鬼，女鬼，好看的鬼，难看的鬼，文鬼，武鬼，以至大头鬼，吊死鬼等等。总之，人世间有的事，鬼世界里也都有。
    有了鬼的故事，自然也有说鬼话的书。从太平广记所引的灵鬼志，到太平御览，太平广记都专门有几卷讲鬼的。清朝有几个人特别喜欢讲鬼故事，一个是蒲松龄，他写了聊斋志异，一个是纪晓岚，他写了阅微草堂笔记，还有一个是袁子才，也喜欢讲鬼。
    蒲松龄和纪晓岚笔下的鬼，形形色色，什么样子脾气的都有，其中有些鬼写得实在好，很使人喜欢。他们通过鬼的故事来讽刺，教育活着的人，说的是鬼话，其实是人话。也写有一些活人，看着是活人，说的却是鬼话，做的是鬼事。
    大体上说来，虽然鬼是从人变的，人死后是鬼，但是人却又怕鬼。另一面，人虽然怕鬼，却又喜欢听鬼故事。
    怕的原因是，据说鬼又要投生变人，屈死鬼投生之前，总得要找一个替身，将人变鬼。以此人们谈鬼就怕，更不用说见鬼了。倒过来，据说人死了就成鬼，人和鬼到底有关系。自己没有作鬼的经验，听听别人的也好，以此又喜欢听鬼故事，大概也是借鉴的意思吧。
    自从有了科学知识，自从有了唯物主义，懂得科学和唯物主义的人们不再相信有鬼了，但是，研究一下过去的若干鬼故事，从中了解这一时代的社会相，也毕竟有些好处。
    何况，死鬼虽然不存在，活鬼却确实有之呢！他们成天张牙舞爪要吃人，青面獠牙吓唬人，鬼头鬼脑摆弄人，鬼心思，鬼主意，鬼行当，鬼伙伴，总之有那末一小撮活鬼在兴风作浪，造谣生事，播弄是非，造成紧张局势，摆出鬼架子，鬼威风。你愈怕，他就愈狠，非把你吃掉不可。
    对付活鬼的办法是大喝一声，你是鬼！揭穿他，让人人都知道这是鬼。把鬼揪到阳光底下，戳穿鬼把戏，鬼伎俩，让人们认识鬼样子，鬼姓名，鬼亲眷，鬼朋友。鬼在人们中间孤立了，也就搞不成鬼玩意了，或者变人，或者真的变鬼，这倒不妨随他的便。
    要对付活鬼，首先要不怕鬼。道理是你不怕，他就怕。这里有几个鬼故事是很有意思的。
    第一个是蒲松龄写的青凤。说有一个狂生叫耿去病，听说有一个荒废的大宅子闹鬼，堂门自己会开关，有时还有笑语歌吹声。他搬了铺盖去住，在楼下读书。晚上正在用功时，一个披发鬼进来了，脸黑得像漆一样，张着眼对他笑。耿去病也对着笑，顺手把砚台的墨汁涂上一脸，面对面瞪着眼睛看。鬼看着不对头，满脸羞惭溜走了。
    第二个是纪晓岚写的吊死鬼。说是有一个姓曹的，住在一个人家。半夜里有一个东西从门缝进来，像一张纸，变成人形，是个女人。他一点也不怕。鬼又披发吐舌，作吊死鬼模样，他笑说，头发还是头发，只是乱一些，舌头还是舌头，只是长一些，有什么可怕。鬼又把头摘下来，放在桌上，他笑说：有头都不怕，何况没头？鬼没有办法，一下不见了。后来又住这房子，半夜门缝又响了，刚一露头，他就嚷，又是这个讨厌东西！鬼一听只好不进来了。
    另一个是大鬼。说戴东原的族祖某人胆大不怕鬼。住进一个空宅子，到晚上，阴风惨惨，出来一个大鬼，说，你真不怕？答：不怕。大鬼做了许多恶样子，又问，还不怕？答：当然。大鬼只好客气地说：我也不一定赶你走，只要你说一声怕，我就走了。他说，真是岂有此理，我实在不怕，怎能说假话。你要怎样就怎样吧。鬼再三央告，还是不理。鬼只好叹一口气说，我在这儿三十多年了，从来没见过你这号顽固的人，这样蠢才，怎能住在一起。只好走了。
    还有一个大眼鬼。南皮许南金胆很大，在和尚庙里读书。夜半忽然墙上出来两个灯，一看是一个大脸孔，两个灯是一双大眼睛。他说：正好，要读书，蜡烛完了。拿一册书背着墙，坐下就朗诵，念不了几页，灯光没有了，扣壁叫唤，也不出来。又一个晚上上厕所，一个小孩给拿蜡烛，不料这个大眼鬼又出来了，对着人笑，小孩吓倒在地下，他捡起蜡烛，就放在大眼鬼头上，说没有灯台，你来得正好。大眼鬼仰着头看，一动也不动。他又说：你哪里不好去，偏要到这里来！听说海上专有人赶臭地方走的，大概就是你了。万不可以对不起你，随手拿一张用过的手纸抹鬼的嘴巴，大眼鬼大呕大吐，狂吼几声，就不见了。从此再也不来了。
    这几个故事很不错，蔑视，鄙视，仇视种种形色的鬼，完全合理。人气盛了，鬼气就衰了；人不怕鬼，鬼就怕人了。
    不但对死鬼该这样，对活鬼也该这样。
    人不可以迷信，要相信科学，尊重科学，但也不妨研究研究鬼话，鬼故事，从中得到益处。讲人话的书要多读，讲鬼话的书，我以为也不妨读读。
