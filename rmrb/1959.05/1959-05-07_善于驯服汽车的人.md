In the Shanghai Sixty-Fourth Route Bus Team, there is a young driver named Wang Guoxin who, after several years of study and exploration, has accumulated a set of driving techniques for saving gasoline. While other drivers in the team consume eighteen or nineteen liters of gasoline per hundred kilometers, he only uses about sixteen liters, and sometimes even less than fifteen liters. Wang Guoxin exceeds his fuel-saving targets every month. Last year alone, he saved three thousand eight hundred liters of gasoline. People call him "a man skilled at taming automobiles." His vehicle has also become the team's red flag car for saving gasoline.

The Sixty-Fourth Route bus runs between the factory district in the northern end of Shanghai and the Huangpu River in the south, with twenty-one stops along the way. Starting after a bus stop consumes a lot of fuel, and Wang Guoxin seized this weak link and adopted a method of rapid gear shifting. As soon as the wheels move, he deftly shifts gears and controls the accelerator. The gear shifting time is only about ten seconds, so fuel consumption is lower. While the bus is running, he always maintains a medium speed. He knows that if the speed is too fast, the resistance is high and more fuel is consumed; if it is too slow, it affects punctuality, and if one stop is late, the number of passengers waiting at the next stop will inevitably increase, and the bus's increased weight will increase fuel consumption.

Wang Guoxin is very familiar with the route conditions. He uses the driving method of coasting with the engine off. When the car reaches a certain roadside tree or telephone pole, he turns off the engine and allows the car to coast for a distance without using gasoline. He also accelerates or coasts according to the traffic and the traffic lights at intersections to avoid fuel-intensive hard braking as much as possible.

Although Wang Guoxin drives an old car that is more than ten years old, the parts are still in good condition because he pays attention to maintenance. Every day before the car leaves the garage, he always carefully checks it for faults; and he adds some hot water to the water tank, so the engine is hot and easier to start, saving fuel.

　　善于驯服汽车的人
    上海第六十四路公共汽车队有个青年司机叫王国新，这人经过几年的钻研、摸索，积累了一套节约汽油的驾驶技术。同队别的司机每一百公里耗油十八、十九公升，他只有十六公升左右，最少的时候甚至不到十五公升。王国新月月超额完成节油指标，仅是去年一年就节省了汽油三千八百公升。人们都称他是“善于驯服汽车的人。”他的那辆车也成了全队节约汽油的红旗车。
    六十四路公共汽车行驶在上海北端工厂区到南面黄浦江边之间，其中有二十一个车站。汽车停站后起步耗油很多，王国新抓住这个薄弱环节，采取迅速换档的办法。汽车轮子一动，就敏捷地调换排档，控制油门。换档时间只有十秒钟左右，因而耗油较少。在汽车行驶中，他始终保持中等的速度。他知道，车速过快，阻力大，耗油就多；过慢又影响正点，一个车站晚了点，以后站上等车的乘客必然增多，汽车负重增加，耗油也就多了。
    王国新非常熟悉路线的情况。他运用了熄火滑行的驾驶方法，汽车开到某棵行道树或某根电线杆的时候就关停引擎，让车子不用汽油滑行一段路程。他还根据车辆来往和十字路口的红绿灯情况来加速或滑行，尽量避免耗油多的急刹车。
    尽管王国新驾驶的是辆十多年的老汽车，但是由于他重视保养，机件仍然很好。每天汽车出场，他总要仔细检查一下，看看有无故障；并且在水箱里加些热水，引擎热了，发动比较容易，用油也就节省。
