Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 6th. The Indian Federal Council actually began debating the Tibet issue, which is purely China's internal affair, on the afternoon of the 4th. The topic was a so-called motion that "the situation arising from the recent events in Tibet should be considered."

A non-party councilor, Raja, expressed his opposition to discussing this motion. He said that Tibet is "part of another country," and he believed that such a discussion would "violate the provisions of Panchsheel" and also violate the Indian Constitution.

Gupta, the Communist leader of the Federal Council, also opposed this motion to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. He said, "I can understand mentioning the Tibet issue in the course of a foreign policy debate. But proposing a separate motion to discuss the Tibet issue would create a bad precedent." He said that the Indian Constitution does not even allow the Indian Parliament to discuss matters in West Bengal or Punjab. He asked Chairman Radhakrishnan to consider whether such a discussion would affect Sino-Indian relations.

Gupta later asked the Chairman once again to oppose this discussion, which "would create a bad precedent."

However, the Chairman refused to accept this objection. He said that we are only discussing the "impact" of the developments in Tibet, and he asked the councilors to "be restrained, considerate, and patient" in their speeches.

After the formal debate began, the non-party councilor Kunzru, who proposed the motion, spoke first. He believed that the Tibetan rebellion "is a nationalistic wave," and that India criticizing China's policy toward Tibet does not constitute interference in China's internal affairs. Kunzru defended himself against accusations of "supporting reactionary elements," saying, "We understand the importance of implementing social and economic reforms. The measures taken in our country can also be promoted by other countries. All colonial countries claim to have implemented social and economic reforms in their colonies. But for these reforms to be lasting, they should be carried out with the goodwill of the people concerned and their leaders."

Referring to the so-called Tibetan "refugees," Kunzru said, "We would be happy if conditions were created to enable them to return." He also said, "I also hope that they will be given reasonable freedom to carry out the peaceful activities they are interested in, including expressing their political opinions."

Congress Party councilor Rao emphasized in his speech Nehru's statement regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's "guarantees" concerning Tibet made in 1956. He said, "In November of that year (1950), when Chinese troops were advancing towards Lhasa, a member of the Indian delegation to the United Nations suggested placing Tibet on the United Nations agenda." However, the head of the Indian delegation "assured the United Nations that Chinese troops had stopped in Qamdo. It was because of this assurance that the suggestion to discuss the Tibet issue at that stage was abandoned."

Rao said that he "sincerely hopes that the recent events in Tibet will not hinder the Indian government from continuing to work for (China's) seat in the United Nations." Because after participating in the United Nations, "at least" it will know that "where human dignity is appreciated, its actions in Tibet are opposed."

Non-party councilor K. Singh said that the Indian people want to maintain friendship with China, but, "How long can this friendship be maintained when the Chinese want to destroy unarmed people?"

People's Socialist Party councilor De. Pa. Singh said, "Our hearts sympathize with the Tibetan people in struggle," because "our peaceful neighbor has suffered misfortune." He also said that "Tibet has never accepted Chinese rule, except under duress."

Congress Party councilor Mrs. Mayadevi Chatri defended the treasonous activities of the Tibetan rebels in Kalimpong, saying, "We belong to that area, but we have not seen any organized anti-China activities."

She even put forward her view: She recognizes the difficulties China faces due to its increasing population, "but this does not mean that they should oppress Tibet."

Gupta, the Communist leader of the Federal Council, pointed out in his speech that in India, some people believe that "Panchsheel was wrongly formulated, so they defame it whenever they have the opportunity." He said that their activities "are an attempt to undermine the foundation of Panchsheel."

He strongly opposed the view expressed earlier that the Tibetan rebellion was a "national uprising." He cited many examples and said, "The Tibetan events were an armed rebellion of reactionary, obscurantist, and dark superstitious forces."

Gupta pointed out that when a small group of people are dominated by communalists, communal riots also occur in India. He asked, "Do we all call all these things national uprisings?"

Gupta quoted newspaper reports to illustrate that the first to welcome this rebellion was Chiang Kai-shek, followed by the U.S. State Department, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

He pointed out that "most people want to handle these issues correctly and develop friendship with China, but another small group is demanding a change in this country's foreign policy." Gupta's speech was repeatedly interrupted by members of the People's Socialist Party. His speech was not yet finished, because the speaking time was up, and the Chairman let Chaman Lall speak.

Congress Party councilor Chaman Lall called for a comprehensive judgment on the Tibet issue. Regarding the insult to Chairman Mao Zedong's portrait in Mumbai, he said, "We all regret this."

He called for considering two factors in the Tibet issue, "The Chinese government retains sovereignty, while Tibet exercises autonomy. These two main features are due to the historical relationship between Tibet and China." He mentioned the so-called "Sino-British-Tibetan Conference" held in Simla, India, and said that the autonomy of Tibet had been stipulated in the agreement reached between Britain and China.

He said, "Our Prime Minister has a responsibility to point out where the problem lies to the Chinese people." He called on India not to abandon its policy of non-alignment.

After this, Nehru delivered a speech.

### 印度联邦院公然辩论我国西藏问题  议员拉贾和古普塔反对讨论其他国家的事务  指出这种讨论违反和平共处原则和印度宪法

　　印度联邦院公然辩论我国西藏问题
    议员拉贾和古普塔反对讨论其他国家的事务
    指出这种讨论违反和平共处原则和印度宪法
    新华社新德里6日电　印度联邦院4日下午竟然开始辩论纯属中国内政的西藏问题，即一项所谓“最近西藏的事件所产生的局势应该予以考虑”的动议。
    一位无党派议员拉贾曾表示反对讨论这项动议。他说：西藏是“另一个国家的一部分”，他认为这种讨论将“违背潘查希拉的规定”，并且也违反印度宪法。
    联邦院共产党领袖古普塔也反对这项干涉别国内政的动议，他说：“我可以理解在外交辩论的过程中提到西藏问题。但是提出讨论西藏问题的单独动议将开创不良的先例。”他说，印度的宪法甚至不允许印度议会讨论西孟加拉邦或旁遮普邦的事情。他要求议长拉达克里希南考虑，这种讨论是否会不影响印中关系。
    古普塔后来又一次要求议长反对这种“将会开创不良的先例的”讨论。
    但是议长拒绝接受这种反对意见。他说，我们只是讨论西藏事态发展的“影响”，他要求议员们在发言时“要自制、体谅人和有耐心”。
    在开始正式辩论后，提出这项动议的无党派议员孔兹鲁首先发言。他认为西藏叛乱“是民族性的浪潮”，印度批评中国对西藏的政策并不等于干涉中国的内政。孔兹鲁为被指责是“支持反动分子”而辩白说，“我们了解实行社会与经济改革的重要性。在我国所采取的措施也可以由其他国家推行。一切殖民国家都声称在它们的殖民地里实行了社会与经济的改革。但是这些改革为了持久，应当在取得有关的人和他们领袖的善意的情况下进行。”
    在谈到所谓西藏“难民”时，孔兹鲁说：“如果创造条件使他们能够回去的话，我们将会感到高兴”。他还说，“我还希望他们将得到合理的自由以便进行他们感到兴趣的和平的活动，包括表示政治上的意见。”
    国大党议员拉奥在发言中强调了尼赫鲁声明中关于周恩来总理在1956年所提出的有关西藏的“保证”的那一节话。他说：“在那一年（1950年）的11月，当中国军队正在向拉萨推进的时候，印度驻联合国代表团的一个成员曾经建议把西藏列入联合国的议程”。但是印度代表团团长“向联合国保证说，中国军队已经在昌都停下来了。正是由于这个保证，关于在那个阶段讨论西藏问题的建议才放弃了。”
    拉奥说他“真诚地希望最近在西藏发生的事件不会妨碍印度政府继续为（中国）在联合国组织内的席位而努力”。因为它在参加联合国组织以后“至少”会知道，“在人类尊严受到赞许的地方，它在西藏的行动是受到反对的。”
    无党派议员克·辛格说，印度人民希望同中国保持友谊，但是，“当中国人想摧毁没有武装的人民时，这种友谊能保持多久呢？”
    人民社会党议员德·帕·辛格说，“我们的心是同情斗争中的西藏人民的”，因为“我们的和平的邻邦遭到了恶运。”他还说“西藏从来没有接受过中国的统治权，除非是在强迫的情况下”。
    国大党的马亚德维·恰特里夫人为西藏叛匪在噶伦堡进行的叛国活动辩护说，我们是属于那个地区的，但是我们没有看到过任何有组织的反对中国的活动。
    她还竟然提出了她的这种看法：她认识到中国由于人口不断增加所面临的困难，“但是这并不意味着，他们应该对西藏进行压迫”。
    联邦院共产党领袖古普塔在发言时指出，在印度，有些人认为，“潘查希拉是错误地制定的，因此只要有机会他们就加以诽谤”。他说，他们的这种活动“是企图打击潘查希拉的基础”。
    他强烈反对早些时候有人表示的这种看法：西藏叛乱是“民族起义”。他举出了许多例子，并且说，“西藏事件是反动的、蒙昧主义的和黑暗迷信势力的武装叛乱。”
    古普塔指出，当一小批人受到教族主义者支配的时候，在印度也发生过教族暴动，他问道，“难道我们大家也把所有这些事情叫做民族起义吗？”
    古普塔引述报纸的消息来说明，首先欢迎这次叛乱的是蒋介石，其次是美国国务院、东南亚条约组织和巴基斯坦总理。
    他指出，“大多数人民希望正确处理这些问题和发展同中国的友谊，但是另外一小撮人却要求改变这个国家的外交政策”。古普塔的发言一再为人民社会党议员所打断，他的发言还没有结束，因为发言时间已经完了，议长就让恰曼拉尔发言。
    国大党议员恰曼拉尔要求对西藏问题作出全面的判断。关于在孟买对毛泽东主席画像的侮辱，他说，“我们大家对此都感到遗憾”。
    他要求在西藏问题方面考虑两个因素，“中国政府保有宗主权，同时西藏实行自治。这两个主要特点是由于西藏和中国之间的历史关系而产生的”。他提到在印度的西姆拉城召开的所谓“中英藏会议”，并且说，在英国和中国达成的协定中，已经规定了西藏的自治。
    他说，“我们的总理有责任向中国人民指出毛病在哪里”。他要求印度不要放弃不结盟政策。
    在这以后，尼赫鲁发表了讲话。
