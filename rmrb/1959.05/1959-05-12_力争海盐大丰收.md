Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Sea Salt
*People's Daily* Commentator

Seize a decisive victory in the decisive quarter. This sentence has special significance for sea salt production. Sea salt is a seasonal product. During the spring drying season each year, the four major sea salt producing areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning experience little rainfall, and their output generally accounts for about 70% of the annual output. This year, the objective situation of the Great Leap Forward requires these areas to achieve more than 90% of their annual production targets in the second quarter. Time is short, the task is heavy, and every minute and second is extremely precious.

How can we seize the opportunity to ensure a complete victory in the spring drying task? The fundamental key lies in carrying out the socialist red flag emulation movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation under the strong leadership of the Party. Maximize the use of natural conditions, try every possible means to increase yield per unit area, improve labor productivity, and fulfill the state plan in a faster, better, and more economical way. According to the current production situation in the sea salt areas, technological revolution and technological innovation must focus on brine-making, water sources, crystallization, tool reform, and mastering meteorology. "Brine is the mother of salt." To produce more salt, we must fully utilize the potential of water lifting equipment, dredge tidal channels, strengthen water source scheduling, store enough seawater with high salinity, promote the experience of deep brine crystallization and various three-dimensional evaporation methods, and discard old brine and other advanced experiences, and maximize the effectiveness of crystallization equipment. In terms of tool reform, the processes that require the most labor and have the heaviest labor burden should be semi-mechanized or mechanized first. In meteorological work, we must also improve our ability to fight against the weather, correctly grasp the trend of weather changes, and determine technical measures based on meteorological conditions. Before rain, we must "five grab": grab stripping, grab transportation, grab covering, grab protection, and grab covering with straw mats; during rain, we must "four diligently": diligently drain fresh water, diligently check sluice gates, diligently check brine concentration, and diligently study post-rain measures; after rain, we must "five timely": timely skim off the fresh brine and leave the concentrated brine, timely remove the mixed brine, timely discharge the fresh brine and introduce saturated brine (moderate rain), timely arrange the upper brine according to the rainfall situation, and timely repair the salt pan (heavy rain). Maximize the use of natural conditions to avoid or reduce losses caused by natural conditions.

Some people have concerns about the meteorological conditions during the spring drying season. If the weather is rainy, there is a risk that production targets will not be met. We believe that meteorological conditions do have an impact on sea salt production, but the main factor determining the success or failure of production is still people's subjective efforts. Experience has proven that under the same conditions of salt field, weather, and equipment, the yield per unit area of one production team often varies greatly from that of another. For example, the average yield per hectare of Lushun Salt Field in Liaoning is 118 tons, while the Sun Huaxi team of the same field reached 219 tons. In the first quarter of this year, especially in February and March, rainfall in the seven coastal provinces was greater than in the same period last year, but the output of the entire sea salt area increased by 29% compared with the same period last year. Some provinces even exceeded one and a half times.

Some people are worried that the supply of materials and equipment will be difficult to solve. In fact, the difficulties of materials and equipment must also be solved by relying on the masses. As long as we mobilize the masses, we can adapt to local conditions and make use of local materials. In order to reform tools, the Huiyang and Liangyang salt areas in Guangdong Province mobilized the masses to contribute ideas and materials, and in a short period of time, they solved the materials needed for 30 windmills, 20 ox carts, 340 branch racks and sprayers, and 2,400 brine tank covers. This year, Tangda Salt Field originally needed to add more than 400,000 reed mats to cover the salt piles. After discussion by the masses, the method of covering was improved, and the covering materials for more than 360,000 tons of crude salt were solved on the premise of ensuring no leakage. From this, it can be seen that as long as we carry out mass movements on a large scale, make great efforts in technological revolution and technological innovation, we can obtain equipment and materials and overcome natural disasters.

At present, the socialist red flag emulation campaign in the salt industry system has already begun, and the morale of the masses is very high. In order to make the movement hotter, more detailed, and more in-depth, we must first earnestly reverse the phenomenon that the leadership of some units lags behind the masses, and resolutely implement the experience of "one handover, four great freedoms, two participations, and three combinations"; protect the hard work spirit of the masses, and inspire and support the masses to work skillfully. The innovative projects proposed by the masses must be carefully studied and evaluated in accordance with the principle of "combining foreign and local methods", focusing on projects that are of great significance to the current production, and promptly promoting them.

Because sea salt enterprises are widespread, have long production lines, and are scattered, the command organization must strengthen the leadership of the front line of production, grasp the situation, and handle problems. Timely exchange advanced experiences. The production teams should be appropriately given more power, especially the power to handle salt collection and brine preservation in the event of weather changes should be given to the team leaders so that they can take measures according to local conditions and time. Give play to an independent combat role.

At present, the "Huaihai Campaign" in the salt industry is in a very tense stage. All salt industry workers should overcome all difficulties and make persistent efforts with unparalleled political enthusiasm and earth-shattering heroic spirit, and resolutely fight this decisive battle well.

    力争海盐大丰收
    本报评论员
    在决定性的季度里夺取决定性的胜利。这句话对于海盐生产有着特殊重要的意义。海盐是带有季节性的产品，每年春晒季节，江苏、山东、河北、辽宁四个主要海盐区，降雨量小、产量一般占年产量70％左右。今年，大跃进的客观形势要求这些地区在二季度内生产指标达到全年任务的90％以上。时间短，任务大，一分一秒都是十分宝贵的。
    怎样抓紧时机保证春晒任务大获全胜呢？根本关键是在党的坚强领导下，大搞以技术革命和技术革新为中心的社会主义红旗竞赛运动。最大限度地利用自然条件千方百计地增加单位面积产量，提高劳动生产率，多快好省地完成国家计划。根据海盐区当前的生产情况，技术革命和技术革新又必须以制卤、水源、结晶、改革工具、掌握气象作为主攻方向。“卤是盐的娘”，要做到多出盐，必须充分发挥扬水设备潜力、挖掘引潮沟、加强水源调度，储足含盐度较高的海水，推广深卤结晶和各种立体蒸发的经验和甩撤老卤等先进经验，发挥结晶设备的效能。在工具改革方面，首先要把用工最多、劳动负荷最重的工序，实现半机械化或机械化。在气象工作上，还必须提高与天时作斗争的能力，正确掌握天气变化趋势，根据气象条件决定技术措施，雨前做到“五抢”：抢扒、抢运、抢苫、抢保、抢蒙；雨中做到“四勤”：勤排淡水，勤检查闸门，勤检查卤水浓度，勤研究雨后措施；雨后做到“五及时”：及时撇去淡卤留下浓卤，及时勾除混卤，及时放出淡卤放入饱和卤（中雨），及时根据降雨情况安排上部卤水，及时修正滩池（大雨）。最大限度地利用自然条件，避免或减少自然条件所造成的损失。
    有些人对于春晒中的气象情况是有顾虑的。万一天气多雨，生产就有完不成的危险。我们认为气象条件对于海盐生产确有影响，但是决定生产好坏的主要因素，还是人的主观努力。经验证明：在同一个场、同样气象、设备条件下，一个小组与另一个小组的单位面积产量常常非常悬殊，如辽宁旅顺盐场平均单产每公顷为一百一十八吨，而该场孙华喜小组则达二百十九吨。今年第一季度，特别是2、3月份，沿海七省的降雨量都大于去年同期，但整个海盐区的产量较去年同期增加了29％。有的省还超过一倍半以上。
    有人担心材料设备不好解决。其实，材料设备的困难，也要依靠群众去解决。只要发动群众，就可以因地制宜，就地取材。广东省的惠阳和两阳盐区，为了革新工具，发动群众献计、献材，短期内就解决了三十架风车、二十架牛车、三百四十座枝条架和喷雾器、二千四百个卤缸盖所需的材料。塘大盐场今年原需要增加封盖盐堆的苇席四十多万张，经过群众讨论，改进了封苫方法，并在保证不漏水的前提下，便解决了三十六万多吨原盐的封苫材料。由此可见，只要大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和技术革新，就可以得到设备材料，战胜自然祸害。
    目前，制盐工业系统社会主义红旗竞赛的阵势已经摆开，群众情绪很高，为了把运动愈搞愈热，愈搞愈细，愈搞愈深入，首先必须认真扭转某些单位领导落后于群众的现象，坚决贯彻一交、四大、两参、三结合的经验；保护群众的苦干精神，启发和支持群众巧干。对群众提出的革新项目，必须根据“洋土结合”的方针，抓紧对目前生产具有重大意义的项目，认真研究鉴定，及时推广。
    由于海盐企业面广、线长，生长分散，指挥机构必须加强生产第一线的领导，掌握情况，处理问题。及时交流先进经验。对于生产小组要适当地增加他们的权力，特别天气变化时关于收盐、保卤的处理权相应地交给小组长，使其因地因时地采取措施。发挥独立的战斗作用。
    目前，制盐工业上的“淮海大战”正处在十分紧张的阶段，全体盐业职工，都应该以无比高涨的政治热情，移山倒海的英雄气概，破除万难，再接再厉，坚决打好这具有决定意义的一仗。
