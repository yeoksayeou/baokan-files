Why Poland and Czechoslovakia
Should Fully Participate in the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference

On May 12th, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko once again stated with full justification at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference that Poland and Czechoslovakia should participate in this Foreign Ministers' Conference. On March 2nd of this year, the Soviet government pointed out in its note to Western countries regarding the convening of a summit meeting: Poland and Czechoslovakia should participate in the summit meeting. It also believed that if Western countries were not prepared to participate in the summit meeting, then, in order to discuss the German peace treaty issue and the West Berlin issue, a foreign ministers' conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia could be convened. Subsequently, the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia successively declared their full support for the Soviet proposal and agreed to participate in the summit meeting and the foreign ministers' conference. The communique of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Warsaw Treaty member states and China, held at the end of April this year, also pointed out: "Full participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and the summit meeting should be guaranteed, because these two countries are neighbors of Germany, they were the earliest victims of Hitler's aggression, and they made significant contributions with their armed forces to crushing the common enemy."

Poland and Czechoslovakia were the first victims of Hitler's aggression in World War II. They suffered the various harms of war and Hitler's occupation for a longer time than other countries, and their sacrifices were extremely great.

As everyone knows, in September 1938, Western countries betrayed Czechoslovakia at the Munich Conference, and in 1939, fascist Hitler officially occupied the entire territory of Czechoslovakia. With the betrayal of Czechoslovakia, peace was buried. The period of Hitler's rule in Czechoslovakia was filled with terrible plunder and horrific massacres. Prisons and concentration camps were filled with patriotic people, and many outstanding sons and daughters of Czechoslovakia were brutally murdered. People around the world cannot forget the name "Lidice." This village in the suburbs of Prague was suddenly surrounded by Nazi occupiers on a certain night in June 1942. Men over the age of fifteen were shot, and women and children were driven to concentration camps; almost all of the village's one hundred and five children were tortured to death, with only sixteen children surviving. The entire village was burned down by Nazi bandits. This is a vivid testimony to the profound suffering inflicted on the Czechoslovak people by the Nazi bandits.

In September 1939, German fascist troops invaded and occupied Poland, and the Polish people suffered severe sacrifices under the occupation of the fascist Hitler's army. More than six million Poles were slaughtered by fascist executioners, and one million six hundred thousand Poles completely or partially lost their labor power under Nazi devastation. During the six years of fascist army occupation, Poland had more than 25,000 buildings razed and destroyed, about 20,000 industrial enterprises destroyed or damaged, and about 467,000 farm households. According to statistics, not a single Polish family was spared from the persecution of the fascists during the Nazi occupation. The Polish capital Warsaw was turned into ruins under the frenzied destruction of Hitler's bandits, with more than 80% of the city destroyed. Before the war, Warsaw had a population of 1.2 million, but after the war only 150,000 remained. Dozens of Polish cities such as Gdansk and Wroclaw, and thousands of villages were completely or almost completely leveled or burned down.

In the anti-fascist war, the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia waged a heroic struggle and made significant contributions. The Polish Workers' Party formed the People's Guard, which carried out anti-fascist armed guerrilla warfare throughout the country. In May 1943, with the help of the Soviet Union, the first Polish army was formed on Soviet territory. The Polish army fought side by side with the Soviet army. It participated with the Soviet army in the liberation of Poland and fought with the Soviet army to the capital of Hitler's Germany, Berlin. The people of Slovakia successfully launched an uprising in August 1944, inflicting a series of heavy blows on the fascist bandit army. The uprising expanded into widespread guerrilla warfare, and the Soviet Union provided great support to this struggle. The heroic achievements of the Polish and Czechoslovak people in the arduous years of resisting Hitler's invaders will forever be recorded in the immortal history of the world's people.

In the years after the war, because Western countries have been actively arming West Germany, the correct resolution of the German issue is directly related to the vital interests of the Polish and Czechoslovak people. West German militarists make no secret of their revanchist intentions towards Poland and Czechoslovakia. Adenauer once openly clamored: "West German rearmament is to prepare for a new order in Eastern Europe." The Bonn government has repeatedly expressed West Germany's ambitions for the so-called "eastern territories," which include parts of Czechoslovakia and western Poland.

All aspects of the situation show that in order to ensure the peaceful and democratic development of Germany and to safeguard the peace and security of European countries, Poland and Czechoslovakia have every right to participate in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on the German issue, and this is absolutely necessary.

### 为什么波兰和捷克斯洛伐克  应当全面参加日内瓦外长会议

    为什么波兰和捷克斯洛伐克
    应当全面参加日内瓦外长会议
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯12日在日内瓦东西方外长会议上再一次以充分的理由说明了波兰和捷克斯洛伐克应参加这次外长会议。今年3月2日，苏联政府在给西方国家关于召开最高级会议的照会中曾指出：波兰和捷克斯洛伐克应参加最高级会议。并认为，如果西方国家不准备参加最高级会议，那么，为了讨论对德和约问题和西柏林问题，可以召开苏联、美国、英国、法国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的外长会议。以后，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克政府先后声明，完全支持苏联的建议，同意参加最高级会议和外长会议。今年4月底召开的华沙条约缔约国和中国外交部长会议公报也指出：“应当保障波兰和捷克斯洛伐克全面地参加日内瓦外长会议和最高级会议，因为这两个国家是德国的邻国，它们是希特勒侵略的最早的受害者，并以它们的武装力量对粉碎共同的敌人作出了重大贡献。”
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克在第二次世界大战中首先成为希特勒侵略的受害者。它们遭受战争和希特勒占领的种种祸害的时间比别国要长，它们的牺牲是极为巨大的。
    大家知道，1938年9月，西方国家在慕尼黑会议上出卖了捷克斯洛伐克，1939年法西斯希特勒正式占领捷克斯洛伐克全境。随着捷克斯洛伐克的被出卖，和平就被葬送了。希特勒统治捷克斯洛伐克的时期，充满了可怕的掠夺和恐怖的屠杀，监狱和集中营里关满了爱国志士，许多优秀的捷克斯洛伐克的儿女被残杀了。全世界人民不能忘记“利迪泽”这个名字，这个在布拉格市郊的村庄，在1942年6月的一个深夜里突然被纳粹占领者包围了，十五岁以上的男子都被枪杀了，妇女儿童都被赶往集中营；全村一百零五个儿童，几乎都被虐杀，只有十六个孩子活了下来。整个村庄被纳粹匪徒放火烧光。这就是纳粹匪徒给捷克斯洛伐克人民造成的深重苦难的活生生的见证。
    1939年9月，德国法西斯军队侵占了波兰，波兰人民在法西斯希特勒军队占领下遭受了严重的牺牲。六百多万波兰人被法西斯刽子手屠杀了，一百六十万波兰人在纳粹摧残中完全或部分丧失了劳动力。在法西斯军队占领的六年中，波兰被夷平和被毁坏的建筑物有二万五千余栋，被毁坏或被损害的工业企业约有二万个，农户则达四十六万七千个左右。据统计，没一个波兰家庭在纳粹占领期间未受到法西斯的残害。波兰首都华沙在希特勒匪徒的疯狂破坏下竟变成了一片废墟，全城的破坏达80％以上，战前华沙有一百二十万人口，战后只剩下十五万人，波兰的革但斯克、弗罗茨拉夫等数十座城市和几千个乡村都完全或几乎被铲平或烧光了。
    在反法西斯战争中，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的人民进行了英勇的斗争，作出了重大的贡献。波兰工人党组成了人民近卫军，在全国范围内进行反法西斯的武装游击战争。1943年5月，在苏联的帮助下在苏联境内组成了第一支波兰军队。波兰军队和苏联军队并肩杀敌，它和苏联军队一起参加了解放波兰的战役，并和苏联军队一起打到了希特勒德国的首都柏林。斯洛伐克的人民在1944年8月成功地发动起义，给法西斯匪军一连串沉重的打击。起义扩展为广泛的游击战争，苏联给予这一斗争以极大的支援。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克人民在抵抗希特勒侵略者的艰苦岁月里的英雄业绩，将永远载入世界人民的不朽史册。
    在大战以后的年代里，由于西方国家一直积极武装西德，德国问题的正确解决，和波兰和捷克斯洛伐克人民有着直接的利害关系。西德军国主义分子毫不掩饰地对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克怀有复仇意图。阿登纳就曾经公开叫嚣：“西德重新武装是为东欧的新秩序作好准备。”波恩政府不止一次地表示了西德对所谓“东部地区”的野心，这个“东部地区”就包括捷克斯洛伐克的部分地区和波兰的西部地区。
    各方面的情况表明，为了保证德国的和平民主发展，保障欧洲各国的和平与安全，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克完全有权利参加这次就有关德国问题进行的日内瓦外长会议，而且这也是完全必要的。（新华社）
