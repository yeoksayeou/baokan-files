Xinhua News Agency, May 9th. At the reception held tonight by Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Bužniak, to celebrate the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic, hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests celebrated the great achievements of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia, a powerful member of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, and celebrated the growing development of the profound friendship and close cooperation between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples.
    In their speeches at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Ambassador Bužniak stated that the Chinese and Czechoslovak governments and peoples fully support the Soviet Union's position on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the ending of the occupation system in West Berlin.
    Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders were invited to attend the reception.
    In his speech at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, warmly congratulated the Czechoslovak people on the brilliant achievements they have made in the cause of building socialism under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the Republic's government over the past fourteen years. He said: "The Chinese people are extremely pleased with the achievements made by the fraternal Czechoslovak people and their continued spirit of courageous advancement. Because our socialist camp is a whole, the achievements of every country in this camp are our common achievements, which help to consolidate and strengthen the entire socialist camp."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The Czechoslovak Republic is a powerful member of the socialist camp family headed by the Soviet Union. It has always been faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism and has insisted on implementing a peaceful foreign policy. Czechoslovakia has been making unremitting efforts in safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism, opposing modern revisionism, in maintaining European security and world peace, and in the noble cause of supporting the liberation movements of oppressed nations. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the position of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries in Europe on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the ending of the occupation system in West Berlin."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized: "The broad friendly and cooperative relations established between our two countries over the years will be increasingly consolidated with the continuous development of the socialist construction of the two countries. The Czechoslovak government and people have given us much help in our socialist construction; they have given us resolute support in our people's struggle against the U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan and the creation of 'two Chinas.' For this, I express my sincere gratitude on behalf of the Chinese government and people."
    Ambassador Bužniak spoke first at the beginning of the reception. In his speech, he introduced to the hundreds of guests the rapid development of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction, thanked the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance to Czechoslovakia's liberation and construction, and excitedly talked about the growing development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia and the increasing strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. He said: "The socialist system will also defeat capitalism in the economic field in the shortest historical period."
    When talking about Czechoslovakia's foreign policy in his speech, the Ambassador said: "The Czechoslovak people resolutely protest against the U.S. imperialism's arming of West Germany with atomic weapons and rocket weapons," "Czechoslovakia fully supports the Soviet Union's position on the German issue, supports the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the West Berlin issue. Our people and government completely stand on the side of the German Democratic Republic and fully support its just struggle for the establishment of a democratic and peace-loving Germany." He said: "We welcome the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that will begin the day after tomorrow in Geneva and expect that this conference will promote the easing of international tensions."
    In his speech, the Ambassador also sternly condemned the U.S. imperialism's criminal activities of accelerating the establishment of aggressive rocket weapon and atomic weapon bases in Asia and other regions, which exacerbate international tensions, and expressed that the Czechoslovak people resolutely support the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions.
    Warm applause rang out in the banquet hall from time to time during the speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yi and Ambassador Bužniak.
    Also invited to attend the reception were Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Bainqen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, heads of various departments of state organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as diplomatic envoys to China from various countries.
