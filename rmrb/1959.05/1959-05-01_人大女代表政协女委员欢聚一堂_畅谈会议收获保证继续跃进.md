Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Women deputies to the National People's Congress and women members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference gathered joyously today at a reception held by the All-China Women's Federation to discuss their gains from attending the meetings and enthusiastically respond to the call of the Second National People's Congress's First Session to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national economic plan.

There are 150 women deputies to the National People's Congress, and 17 women members and 10 specially invited representatives to the CPPCC. They are mostly outstanding cadres among women of all ethnic groups and social strata, as well as model workers, famous writers, and actors. Cai Chang, President of the All-China Women's Federation, said at the meeting: You are about to return to your work posts, and I believe that you will respond to the call of the conference with greater confidence and determination, and with even more outstanding achievements, to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day. She also hoped that the deputies and members would more broadly mobilize women to unite and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

National People's Congress deputies Wei Fengying (worker), Shen Jilan (commune director), and Zhang Qiuxiang (cotton planting expert) spoke at the meeting, all expressing their determination to respond to the call of the conference with practical actions. Before coming to Beijing for the meeting, Wei Fengying and her fellow workers had already saved the state 470,000 yuan by tapping potential and finding shortcuts. She plans to save the state another 1 million yuan this year. Shen Jilan said that she guarantees to lead all the women and men of her commune to actively strive to complete their commune's task of doubling grain production.

The reception took place in a joyous atmosphere for three hours. Many actors and singers also gave wonderful performances at the meeting.
