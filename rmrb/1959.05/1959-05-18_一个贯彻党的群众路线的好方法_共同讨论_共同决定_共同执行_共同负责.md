A Good Method for Implementing the Party's Mass Line
Joint Discussion, Joint Decision, Joint Implementation, Joint Responsibility
Wang Kuang

This spring, a new slogan emerged in the rural areas of Guangdong – "Four Jointlys": jointly discuss, jointly decide, jointly implement, jointly be responsible. This was proposed by rural work cadres in Guangdong during the spring plowing production, and it is a concrete method for implementing the Party's mass line, closely connecting cadres and the masses, and giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. By adopting this method, the early rice planting and transplanting plan was completed ten to fifteen days earlier than last year, and the planting density was doubled compared to last year. The production enthusiasm of the masses is high, and a new revolutionary atmosphere is beginning to form among the cadres.

A Concrete Creation of Following the Mass Line

The mass line is the fundamental line of the Party. We not only relied on it to achieve victory in the revolutionary struggle, but also relied on it to achieve brilliant achievements in the construction period, and will continue to achieve greater victories in the future. Comrade Mao Zedong is the brilliant advocate of our Party's mass line. He often told us that the people are truly great, and the creativity of the masses is endless. We can only be invincible by relying on the people, and only the people are the true creators of history; true history is the history of the people. Starting from this basic viewpoint of historical materialism, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to us the mass line, the only correct line that leads the revolution to victory, and also pointed out to us various specific methods for following the mass line. As early as during the domestic revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the relationship between the revolutionary army and the people is like that of fish and water; the army is the fish, and the masses are the water. Fish cannot live without water. Therefore, he personally formulated the famous "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." Later, Comrade Mao Zedong told us that we must care about the people's lives, pay attention to working methods, and consult with the masses when encountering problems. All these instructions are very important. The victory of the Chinese revolution is precisely the result of consistently implementing the mass line advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong. After the national liberation, our Party became the ruling party. In order to prevent the dangerous tendency of becoming detached from the masses due to possible arrogance and complacency, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly warned us that we must adopt the mass line in all our work. In recent years, Comrade Mao Zedong has particularly emphasized to us that, as Lenin said, our Party members and cadres should appear among the people as ordinary laborers; and when carrying out work, we should "deliberate carefully and make decisive judgments." For many years, all our Party members and cadres have faithfully implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. During the land reform struggle, we put forward the slogan of "Three Togethers," eating, living, and working together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The "Four Jointlys" now proposed are a concrete creation of resolutely implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching of following the mass line.

The reason why the slogan of "Four Jointlys" is good and is a creation of implementing the mass line is because it well embodies the spirit of the Party's mass line and is a good form of following the mass line found in revolutionary practice. Implementing the "Four Jointlys" has many benefits. It can concentrate and develop the wisdom of the masses; it can strengthen the masses' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and give play to the masses' high degree of enthusiasm and creativity; and it can prevent bureaucracy and commandism.

An Effective Method of Deliberating Carefully and Making Decisive Judgments

The consideration and decision of problems by an individual or a small number of people is always less comprehensive, thorough, and correct than that of the majority. "Three cobblers combined are equal to Zhuge Liang." Being able to consult with the masses and make joint decisions when carrying out work means asking for advice from thousands of "Zhuge Liangs" among the masses. In this way, we can make up for the deficiencies of the leadership and make our subjective understanding more in line with objective reality, thereby making various guidelines, policies, indicators, plans, and measures more practical and feasible. Comrade Mao Zedong told us that we must deliberate carefully and make decisive judgments when doing things. In our work, we often hold various discussion meetings and heart-to-heart talks, carefully listen to various opinions of the masses (including subordinates), and jointly discuss with the masses. This is "deliberating carefully." In the discussion process, we absorb many useful suggestions and correct opinions from the masses and jointly make decisions with the masses. This is "making decisive judgments." "Making decisive judgments" and "deliberating carefully" are inseparable. To make good decisions, we must have good discussions. And to have good discussions, we must believe that the wisdom of the masses is endless. In fact, the masses have many concrete experiences and practical knowledge that many of our cadres do not have. In this year's spring plowing production, because the vast number of cadres were able to jointly discuss with the masses, the masses put forward many good opinions, such as what kind of seeds should be used in which fields, how dense should the planting be in which plots of land, and what kind of fertilizer should be applied to what kind of soil. At present, the masses continue to put forward many useful opinions in the field management work. It can be affirmed that if we did not jointly discuss with the masses, but only relied on the cadres, no matter how hard we racked our brains, we would not be able to come up with some of these opinions. No wonder many commune members said with satisfaction: "The cadres are so humble and discuss with us jointly. This year will surely be another bumper harvest." Of course, not every opinion of the masses is necessarily correct; moreover, in the discussion, there are often different or even completely opposite opinions. If erroneous opinions appear among the masses, it is not a big deal, but at least has two advantages: one is to give the cadres a reference for comprehensively considering the problem, that is, what should you do when you encounter such opposing opinions? In this way, the consideration of the problem will be more thorough and more mature; the other is to give the cadres the basis for mobilizing and persuading the masses. If we want the masses to consciously carry out various work tasks, we must first make the masses understand why these tasks must be done and how to do them; since we have learned in advance what opposing opinions the masses have, we can carry out ideological education work for the masses in a targeted manner, so that the masses can consciously invest in various tasks. Truth is not afraid of discussion, and the more it is debated, the clearer it becomes. This process of having both approving opinions and opposing opinions, and making them tend towards unity (the unity of opposites, not reconciliation) through debate, analysis, and research, and drawing correct or relatively correct conclusions, is the so-called dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Therefore, it is unreasonable to be afraid of consulting with the masses and not daring or willing to jointly discuss and jointly decide with the masses.

Strengthening the Masses' Sense of Responsibility as Masters of Their Own Affairs

Our Party and the various undertakings led by our Party are all undertakings of the people, and they can only be done well through the conscious actions of the people. Therefore, highly giving play to the people's democratic spirit of being masters of their own affairs is the most fundamental characteristic of our revolutionary cause. How to turn the Party's slogans into the masses' own slogans, and how to turn the tasks put forward by the Party into the masses' own tasks, has become the most decisive thing for whether the work is successful or not, and whether it is done well or badly. The "Four Jointlys" are precisely a good method for strengthening the people's sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and mobilizing the masses to consciously fight for the completion of the tasks put forward by the Party. If the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses has not been fully发挥出来 in some past work, one of the reasons is that some of them still regard revolutionary work as only the Party's business, the government's business, and the cadres' business, and not as their own business. Therefore, for various tasks, they often hold the attitude of knowing but not speaking, and speaking but not speaking exhaustively. This can only be blamed on us for not seriously implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction to consult with the masses when encountering problems and not jointly discussing problems with the masses. There is also a situation where some comrades also solicit the opinions of the masses when carrying out work, but they have not well adopted the correct opinions of the masses, especially have not achieved joint decisions with the masses, and put forward concrete and feasible measures based on the correct opinions of the masses. If the correct opinions and reasonable suggestions of the masses are not adopted and implemented, they will naturally feel that it is almost the same whether they make suggestions or not, and their proactive spirit as masters of their own affairs will naturally be damaged. Obviously, carrying out work in this way is not appropriate, either in attitude or method. Therefore, it is not enough to have joint discussions, but also joint decisions. It is not enough to have joint implementation of eating, living, and working together, but also the spirit of joint responsibility. The reason why the working method of jointly discussing, jointly deciding, jointly implementing, and jointly being responsible is worthy of attention and promotion is because it conforms to the basic principle of Marxism that the people are the masters of history and is the correct application of the Party's mass line. As long as we earnestly implement it, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, the broad masses will surely support us and regard the revolutionary cause as their life and as their supremely glorious cause.

Overcoming and Preventing Cadres' Bureaucracy and Commandism

Implementing the "Four Jointlys" can also effectively overcome and prevent cadres' bureaucracy and commandism. Because it truly embodies the Party's traditional style of consulting with the masses when encountering problems and closely linking with the masses; and to practically implement the "Four Jointlys," cadres must appear as ordinary laborers and truly achieve breathing together and sharing the fate with the masses, which also eliminates the root causes of bureaucracy and commandism. Bureaucracy and commandism are historical relics of the rule of the past exploiting classes and are opposed to our Party's fine traditions. They seriously violate the Party's fundamental principle that we must "come from the masses and go to the masses" and that all revolutionary work must be participated in by the masses consciously and voluntarily. Implementing joint discussion, joint decision, joint implementation, and joint responsibility can make cadres not stand high above the masses, but go deep into the masses; not ignore the opinions of the masses, but carefully listen to the voices of the masses; not only make joint decisions on the basis of joint discussions with the masses to ensure that the decisions are as correct as possible, but also, in joint implementation, on the one hand, make the masses further understand the correctness of the Party's slogans from personal experience, and on the other hand, draw lessons from experience and revise some incorrect parts of the original decisions in a timely manner based on the implementation situation and newly generated problems; not force the masses to accept the Party's slogans and tasks with simple, rigid, and commanding methods, but enlighten and improve the masses' awareness according to the masses' degree of awareness, and lead them to fight under the principle of the masses' inner willingness. Therefore, once the "Four Jointlys" are formed into a system, they can effectively prevent the occurrence and growth of cadres' bureaucracy and commandism, and can rely on the supervision of the masses to force some cadres who do not implement the Party's mass line well to seriously follow the mass line; at the same time, the "Four Jointlys" themselves specifically indicate to the cadres how they should follow the mass line.

Conducive to Strengthening the Party's Leadership

Regarding the implementation of the "Four Jointlys," some people have also raised questions. They believe that: "Isn't doing this abandoning leadership?" We say that implementing the "Four Jointlys" will not only not abandon leadership, but on the contrary, can strengthen the Party's leadership. Adhering to the Party's leadership and implementing the "Four Jointlys" are not contradictory, but consistent. The various policies of our Party represent the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people, not the interests of a few people. Therefore, correct leadership must represent the interests of the masses, otherwise it is not called leadership, or it can only be called wrong leadership. Since the "Four Jointlys" can enable us to deliberate carefully and make decisive judgments, prevent bureaucracy and commandism, give play to the masses' spirit of being masters of their own affairs, and perfectly realize the Party's propositions, that is, to enable the broad masses of the people to obtain the greatest benefits, how can this be said to be abandoning leadership? If the proposals we put forward are not accepted by the masses at all, this is not because the "Four Jointlys" make it impossible for us to carry out leadership, but because our ideas do not conform to the interests of the masses and are not correct, then we must revise them, which can make us as far as possible not to make or make fewer mistakes, and ensure the correctness of the leadership. Comrade Mao Zedong told us:

"All correct tasks, policies, and work styles are in line with the demands of the masses at that time and place and are connected with the masses; all wrong tasks, policies, and work styles are not in line with the demands of the masses at that time and place and are detached from the masses." People who are afraid that implementing the "Four Jointlys" will abandon leadership probably equate so-called leadership with simply issuing orders to the masses, and do not understand that leadership must be combined with the masses. This understanding is obviously wrong. Of course, implementing the "Four Jointlys" does not mean that cadres can not use their brains, can not consider and study problems in advance, and put forward plans, but let the masses discuss as they wish and decide as they wish; if this is the case, it is letting things go and tailism. The "Four Jointlys" we are talking about are carried out under the active leadership of the Party, so cadres must think about problems more seriously, enlighten the masses more carefully, and help the masses organize and devote themselves to the struggle, rather than advocating spontaneity. Marxists have always opposed the theory of spontaneity of mass movements.

Some people also say: "Work is so busy and tasks are so urgent, where can we get so much time to implement the 'Four Jointlys'?" This statement actually denies that all work must follow the mass line and provides an excuse for bureaucracy and forced command style. Since we admit that the revolutionary cause is the people's own cause and must be done by the people themselves, and not by a few cadres, then we should also admit that no matter how busy the work is and how urgent the tasks are, we can only do the work more, faster, better, and more economically by following the mass line, jointly consulting with the masses, jointly deciding problems, and jointly implementing them and jointly bearing the responsibility. Facts have proved that the shorter the time and the heavier the task, the more important it is to follow the mass line. We should believe in the revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the masses. As long as we mobilize the masses, sincerely implement the "Four Jointlys," and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, the contradiction between time and tasks will naturally be solved easily. Although on the surface, forced commands seem to be effective, the effect is actually very bad. It will make us detached from the masses. May I ask, for communists, what is more dangerous than being detached from the masses?

The "Four Jointlys," as a specific working method, are a new creation for implementing the Party's mass line and need to be continuously enriched and perfected according to practical experience; however, it should be affirmed that this approach is correct. At present, it has become a good form for us to follow the mass line in leading the production and construction movement, and it is very necessary to promote it.

    一个贯彻党的群众路线的好方法
    共同讨论  共同决定  共同执行  共同负责
    王匡
    今年春天，在广东农村中出现一个新的口号——“四共同”：共同讨论、共同决定、共同执行、共同负责。这是广东的农村工作干部在春耕生产中提出来的，是贯彻执行党的群众路线，密切干部和群众的关系，发挥群众的积极性和创造性的具体方法。由于采取这个方法，今年早造的播种和插秧计划，比去年提早了十天至十五天完成，而且，插秧的密度比去年增加了一倍，群众的生产情绪高涨，干部中开始形成一种新的革命风气。
    走群众路线的一种具体创造
    群众路线是党的根本路线。我们不仅在革命斗争时期靠它取得了革命的胜利，而且在建设时期也靠它取得了辉煌的成就，并在今后将继续取得更大的胜利。毛泽东同志是我们党的群众路线的英明倡导者。他经常告诉我们：人民群众是真正伟大的，群众的创造力，是无穷无尽的，我们只有依靠了人民群众，才是不可战胜的，只有人民群众，才是历史的真正创造者，真正的历史是人民群众的历史。从历史唯物主义的这一基本观点出发，毛泽东同志给我们指出了群众路线这一使革命走向胜利的唯一正确的路线，同时也给我们指出了各种走群众路线的具体方法。早在国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志就指出革命军队同人民群众的关系是鱼水关系，军队是鱼，群众是水，鱼没有水是不能活的。因此，他亲手制订了有名的“三大纪律，八项注意”。以后，毛泽东同志又告诉我们必须关心群众生活，注意工作方法，遇事同群众商量，所有这些指示，都是十分重要的。中国革命的胜利，正是由于贯彻始终地实行了毛泽东同志所倡导的群众路线的结果。全国解放以后，我们的党成了执政的党，为了防止可能由于骄傲自满而脱离群众的危险倾向，党中央和毛泽东同志更是谆谆告诫我们，必须在一切工作中采取群众路线。近几年来，毛泽东同志特别强调地向我们提出要像列宁所说的那样，在人民群众中，我们的党员和干部要以普通劳动者的姿态出现；在进行工作时要“多谋善断”。多少年来，我们全体党员和干部都是忠实地执行毛泽东同志的指示的。在土地改革斗争中，我们提出了“三同”的口号，与贫雇农群众同吃、同住、同劳动。现在提出的“四共同”，就是坚决执行毛泽东同志所教导的走群众路线的一种具体创造。
    “四共同”的口号所以提得好，所以是实行群众路线的一种创造，乃是因为它很好地体现了党的群众路线的精神，是在革命的实践中找到的走群众路线的很好的形式。实行“四共同”，有很多好处。它可以集中和发扬群众的智慧；它可以加强群众主人翁的责任感，发挥群众的高度的积极性和创造性；它可以防止官僚主义和命令主义。
    多谋善断的有效方法
    个人或少数人考虑问题，决定问题，总是不如多数人那样全面、周到和正确。“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”。进行工作能够和群众共同商量，共同决定，就是向群众中成千成万的“诸葛亮”请教，这样就可以补领导之不足，使我们的主观认识更加合乎客观实际，从而使得各项方针、政策、指标、计划和措施，更加切实可行。毛泽东同志告诉我们，做事要多谋善断。在我们的工作中，经常召开各种各样的讨论会、谈心会，细心倾听群众（包括下级）的各种各样的意见，与群众共同讨论，这就是“多谋”。在讨论过程中，吸取群众许多有益的建议和正确的意见，和群众共同作出决定，这就是“善断”。“善断”和“多谋”，是不可分的。要决定得好，一定要讨论得好。而要讨论得好，就必须相信群众的智慧是无穷的。事实上，群众中有很多具体的经验，有许多实际的知识，是我们许多干部所没有的。在今年的春耕生产中，由于广大干部能够做到与群众共同讨论，因而群众提出了许多很好的意见，例如那里的田该用什么样的种子，那一块地该插多密，什么样的土质该施什么样的肥料等等。目前在田间管理工作中，群众也继续提出了不少有益的意见。可以肯定，如果不是与群众共同讨论，只是靠干部，不管如何绞尽脑汁，有些意见也是想不出来的。难怪许多社员都满意地说：“干部这样虚心和我们共同讨论，今年一定又是大丰收”。当然，群众的意见，未必每一项都是正确的；而且，在讨论中，往往会存在着不同的以至完全相反的意见。假如群众中出现了错误的意见，也不是什么大不了的坏事，而至少有两个方面的好处：其一是给干部作为全面考虑问题的参考，即当你碰到这样的反对意见时，应该怎么办？这样，对问题的考虑就会更周密，更成熟；其二是给干部作为动员、说服群众的依据。如要使群众自觉地执行各项工作任务，就必须先要使群众明白这些工作为什么要做，以及如何去做；既然事前了解了群众中有那些反对意见，我们就能够有的放矢地做好对群众的思想教育工作，从而使群众自觉地投入各项工作中去。真理是不怕讨论的，并且愈辩则愈明。这种既有赞成意见，又有反对意见，经过争辩、分析、研究，使之趋于统一（对立面的统一，而不是调和），得出正确或比较正确的结论，就是所谓正反合的辩证的过程。所以，害怕跟群众商量，不敢或不愿与群众共同讨论，共同决定，是没有道理的。
    加强群众主人翁的责任感
    我们党的及我们党所领导的各种事业，都是人民群众的事业，并且只有通过人民群众自觉的行动，才能够做好。因此，高度地发挥人民群众当家作主的民主精神，是我们的革命事业的最根本的特点。如何把党的口号变为群众自己的口号，如何把党所提出的任务变为群众自己的任务，也就成为工作是成功还是失败、是做好还是做坏的最有决定意义的东西。“四共同”正是加强人民群众主人翁的责任感，动员群众自觉地为完成党所提出的任务而斗争的好方法。如果说，在过去的一些工作中，群众的革命积极性还没有充分地发挥出来的话，原因之一就是因为他们中有一些人还把革命工作只当作是党的事情、政府的事情、干部的事情，而不认为是自己切身的事情。因此，对于各种工作，他们往往抱着知而不言，言而不尽的态度。这当然只能怪我们没有认真执行毛泽东同志的遇事同群众商量的指示，没有与群众共同讨论问题。还有一种情况，有些同志虽然在进行工作时也征询了群众的意见，但是他们没有很好地采纳群众的正确意见，特别是没有做到和群众共同决定，依据群众的正确意见提出具体可行的措施。群众正确的意见和合理的建议没有得到采纳和执行，自然就会觉得意见提了与不提差不多，他们的主人翁的积极主动精神自然就要受到损伤。很明显，这样地进行工作，无论在态度上或者方法上，都是不够妥当的。因此，光是有共同讨论是不够的，还要有共同决定，光是有同吃同住同劳动的共同执行是不够的，还要有共同负责的精神。与群众共同讨论，共同决定，共同执行，共同负责的工作方法之所以值得重视和提倡，就是因为它符合马克思主义的人民群众是历史的主人的基本原则，是党的群众路线的正确运用。只要我们认真加以执行，就会如毛泽东同志所说的，广大群众必定拥护我们，把革命事业当作他们的生命，当作他们无上光荣的事业。
    克服和防止干部的官僚主义、命令主义
    实行“四共同”，还可以有效地克服和防止干部的官僚主义和命令主义。因为它真正体现了党的遇事同群众商量，密切联系群众的传统作风；而要切实地执行“四共同”，干部就必须以普通劳动者的姿态出现，真正做到和群众同呼吸、共命运，这也就杜绝了产生官僚主义和命令主义的根源。官僚主义和命令主义是过去剥削阶级统治的历史遗物，是和我们党的优良传统相对立的，它严重地违反党所主张的必须“从群众中来，到群众中去”，一切革命工作都必须由群众自觉自愿地参加的根本原则。实行共同讨论，共同决定，共同执行，共同负责，就可以使干部不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中，不是漠视群众的意见，而是细心地倾听群众的呼声；不仅是在与群众共同讨论的基础上，共同作出决定，以保证决定的尽可能正确，而且能在共同执行中，一方面使群众从亲身经验中进一步体会党的口号的正确，另一方面也可以同群众一道，根据执行的情况和新产生的问题得出经验教训，及时修正原来决定中的某些不够正确的部分；不是用简单的、生硬的、命令的办法强制群众接受党的口号和任务，而是根据群众的觉悟程度，去启发和提高群众的觉悟，在群众出于内心自愿的原则之下，带动他们进行斗争。所以，“四共同”一经形成为制度，就可以有效地防止干部官僚主义和命令主义的发生和滋长，并且可以依靠群众的监督，迫使某些对党的群众路线执行得不好的干部，不得不认真地走群众路线；同时“四共同”本身，也具体地为干部指明了应当如何走群众路线。
    有利于加强党的领导
    对于实行“四共同”，也有人提出了疑问，他们认为：“这样做，不是放弃领导吗？”我们说，实行“四共同”，不仅不会放弃领导，相反可以加强党的领导。坚持党的领导，和实行“四共同”并不矛盾，而是一致的。我们党的各项政策，都是代表最广大人民群众的最大利益，而不是代表少数人的利益的。因此，正确的领导，必须是代表群众的利益，否则就不叫领导，或者只能叫做错误的领导。既然“四共同”可以使得我们做到多谋善断，防止官僚主义和命令主义，可以发挥群众当家作主的精神，完满地实现党的主张，也就是使广大人民群众得到最大的利益，这怎么能说是放弃领导呢？如果我们提出的主张，根本不为群众所接受，这并不是由于“四共同”使得我们无法进行领导，而是说明我们的想法不符合群众的利益，不正确，那就要加以修正，这正可以使我们尽可能做到不犯或少犯错误，保证领导的正确。毛泽东同志告诉我们：
  “凡属正确的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的；凡属错误的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求不相适合，都是脱离群众的。”害怕实行“四共同”会放弃领导的人，大概是把所谓领导同单纯的对群众发号施令等同起来，而不懂得领导必须与群众相结合，这种认识显然是不对的。当然，实行“四共同”，并非干部就可以不动脑筋，可以不事先考虑和研究问题，提出方案，而听任群众愿意怎样讨论就怎样讨论，愿意怎么决定就怎么决定；要是这样，就是放任自流，尾巴主义。我们所说的“四共同”，是在党的积极领导下进行的，因此干部必须更加认真地思考问题，更细心地启发群众，帮助群众组织起来，投入斗争，而不是提倡自发性。马克思主义者从来都是反对群众运动自发论的。
    也有人说：“工作这样忙，任务这么急，哪来这么多时间实行‘四共同’？”这种说法，实际上是否认一切工作都要走群众路线，为官僚主义、强迫命令作风提供借口。既然我们承认革命事业是人民群众自己的事业，必须由群众自己动手才能做好，而不是少数干部所能包办得了的，那末，我们也就应当承认，不管工作多忙，任务多急，也只有走群众路线，与群众共同商量，共同决定问题，并且共同付诸执行，共同担负责任，才能把工作做得多、快、好、省。事实证明，越是时间短、任务重，越是要走群众路线。我们应当相信群众的革命积极性和无穷智慧。只要发动群众，诚心诚意地实行“四共同”，把群众的积极性和创造性调动起来，时间与任务之间的矛盾，自然迎刃而解。虽然从表面看来，强迫命令似乎也能收到效果，但其实效果很坏，它会使得我们脱离群众；试问对于共产党人来说，还有什么比脱离群众更加危险的呢？
    “四共同”，作为具体的工作方法，它是贯彻执行党的群众路线的一种新的创造，需要根据实践的经验继续加以充实和使之完善起来；但是，应当肯定，这一做法是对头的，目前它已成为我们领导生产建设运动中走群众路线的一种好的形式，很有加以提倡的必要。
