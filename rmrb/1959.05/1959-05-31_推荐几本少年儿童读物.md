“The Secret of Black Dragon Lake”

This is an interesting scientific adventure story.

Black Dragon Lake churns incessantly year-round. Legend says that a kind little black dragon is locked at the bottom of the lake, and the little black dragon refuses to submit, wagging its tail year-round in protest.

A group of children, not believing this, are determined to find out why Black Dragon Lake churns incessantly. During the summer vacation, they take dry rations and quietly embark on a rugged, steep, and unfamiliar mountain road. Along the way, they encounter terrible mountain floods, cross rivers without bridges, fall into a badger's home, and pass through extremely magnificent caves. They run out of food and even encounter wolves. In short, they encounter difficulties and dangers, experience many interesting things, overcome hardships, share joy, and finally find Black Dragon Lake and uncover its secret.

It turns out that they have found an extremely rich oil deposit for the motherland!

“A Youth on the Border”

This is a long poem written by the poet Li Ji, and it is an enthusiastic ode to a young hero.

The story takes place in the spring of 1947. At that time, the reactionaries attacked Yan'an, and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao withdrew from Yan'an and came to the border area, living in a small village. One day, a shepherd boy from the village saw Chairman Mao by a small river. Later, on a stormy night, due to the enemy situation, this boy led the People's Liberation Army, and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao moved to another place from here. On the way back to the village after completing his mission, the boy was captured by the enemy. In front of the enemy, he demonstrated an indomitable spirit of fearlessness, answering the enemy's torture with only the three words "don't know." Finally, he escaped from the tiger's den.

The image of the young man in the poem is very clear and vivid. The poet profoundly describes this young hero's loyalty and love for the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as his hatred for the enemy.

This is a simple and beautiful long narrative poem, and also a good book for conducting revolutionary tradition education for children and young people.

“They Are Creating Miracles”

This is a work that sings the praises of the creative spirit of children and young people. They are small in stature but have great ambitions. With their own hands, and after painstaking efforts, the members of the "Michurin Group" have achieved one victory after another in the battle to transform nature. The sunflowers they grow are as big as washbasins, and the chayotes they grow are as big as gourds. They have grown a strange crop that bears Jerusalem artichokes below and sunflowers above; they have grown multi-eared corn. Not only that, they have also cultivated rare fourteen-eared wheat and grown garlic heads from garlic cloves. These sound like fairy tales, but they are miracles created by the children of our time. Who can say they are not "skilled little farmers"! However, all these achievements are seen by the children as only the beginning of the battle. They will create even greater miracles in the future!

The miracles they create do not come from the children's curiosity; they have a clear purpose. They want to create new varieties not only for the cooperative, but also for the entire township, county, and even the country's agricultural production. They rely on the infinite power of the collective and oppose all individualistic plans: "No matter what, the light released by the 'Michurin Group' is shared by every little star, and every member's mind is a small spark of wisdom." All of this is carried out under the leadership of the Party and the Communist Youth League. (Qiao Liwen)

“Under the Team Flag”

This is a collection of essays and features that record the activities and lives of Young Pioneers. It truthfully depicts the mental outlook of our new generation as they grow up. Its content is quite broad, including the learning, labor, social public welfare work, and joyful team activities of the members. The whole book clearly and prominently writes about the Party's cordial care for the Young Pioneers. At the garden party celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, marshals sat intimately with the Young Pioneers, talking about some far-reaching things and encouraging the Young Pioneers to strive for the cause of socialism; excellent worker comrades, in their busy work, still care about the members, and take the members to visit the mine during their busy schedule to conduct education and help; volunteer army combat heroes also care for the growth of the members in every possible way and establish a deep friendship with the members; naughty "wild children" become excellent Young Pioneers under the teacher's careful education; and so on. This content can give readers infection and education, and make young readers love the Party and our new society even more.

From the book, we can also see that the organization of the Young Pioneers is so vibrant, guiding the members to move forward every day through various activities. For example, "Study Hard for the Motherland" introduces the various methods used by the Young Pioneers to help members study well; "Red Scarf Toothbrush Factory" and "'June 1st' Fish Pond" write about how the Young Pioneers have learned rich knowledge from labor; "Brother Li An Lives Forever in Our Hearts" and "Learn from the Good Example of the Children's Corps" write about how the Young Pioneers are learning the excellent qualities of revolutionary martyrs and former Children's Corps members; and in articles such as "Six 'Little Detectives'," "Red Scarf Health Supervision Post," and "Young Pioneers Who Respect the Old and Love the Young," the article introduces how the Young Pioneers participate in the struggle for the whole people and care about social public welfare. All these activities are suitable for the physical and mental conditions and interests of children and young people, and are vivid teaching materials. (Lin Yiding)

    推荐几本少年儿童读物
    “黑龙湖的秘密”
    这是一个有趣的科学探险故事。
    黑龙湖终年翻滚不息，传说是在湖底锁了一条好心的小黑龙，小黑龙不甘屈服，终年甩动着尾巴表示反抗。
    有一群孩子，他们不相信这样的事情，一定要查清黑龙湖终年翻滚的原因。在暑期里，他们带着干粮，悄悄地走上了崎岖险峻而又陌生的山路。一路上，他们遇到了可怕的山洪，度过了没有桥的小河，掉进猪獾的家里，还穿过了极其瑰丽的山洞。他们没有了粮食，还遇到过狼。总之，他们遇到过困难和危险，经历过许多有趣的事情，他们战胜了艰险，分享了快乐，最后，终于找到了黑龙湖，揭开了黑龙湖的秘密。
    原来，他们给祖国找到了一处极其丰富的石油矿！
    “三边一少年”
    这是诗人李季写的一首长诗，这是一首热情的少年英雄赞歌。
    故事发生在1947年春天。当时反动派进攻延安，党中央和毛主席撤离延安来到了三边，住在一个小村子里。村里一个放羊少年，有一天，在小河边上见到了毛主席。以后，在一个暴风雨的夜晚，由于有了敌情，这个少年为解放军带路，党中央和毛主席从这里转移到别处。在完成任务回村的路上，少年被敌军抓住了，在敌人面前，他表现了英勇不屈的大无畏精神，他只用“不知道”三个字来回答敌人的酷刑拷打，最后他逃出了虎口。
    诗中少年的形象非常鲜明、生动。诗人深刻地描写了这个少年英雄对党和毛主席的忠诚和热爱，以及对敌人的仇恨。
    这是一首朴素、优美的长篇叙事诗，也是一本对少年儿童进行革命传统教育的好书。
     “他们在创造奇迹”
    这是一本歌颂少年儿童创造精神的作品。他们人小志气大，用自己的双手，经过苦心经营，“米丘林小组”的组员们在改造自然的战斗中取得接二连三的胜利。他们种的向日葵有脸盆那样大，他们种的笋瓜像冬瓜一样大；他们种出了一种下面结洋姜上面结向日葵的奇异作物；他们种出了一种多穗玉米。不仅如此，他们还培育出罕有的十四个穗的小麦。用蒜子种出了大蒜头。这些听起来像童话，但却是我们时代的儿童创造出来的奇迹。谁能说他们不是“有本领的小农民”呢！然而所有这些成就在孩子们看来还仅仅是战斗的开头。他们今后还要创造更大的奇迹哩！
    他们创造的奇迹，并非出自孩子们的好奇心理，他们有着明确的目的，他们不但为合作社，还要为全乡、全县，甚至为全国的农业生产创造新的品种。他们依靠的是集体的无穷无尽的力量，反对一切个人主义的打算：“不管怎么样，‘米丘林小组’放出来的光芒是每一颗小星都有份的，每一个组员的头脑就是一颗智慧的小火星”。这一切都是在党、团的领导下进行的。　（乔立文）
    “在队旗下”
    这是一本纪录少先队员的活动和生活的散文特写集。它真实地描绘了我们新生一代正在成长中的精神面貌。它的内容相当广泛，有队员的学习、劳动、社会公益工作、愉快的队活动等。全书鲜明、突出地写出了党对少先队的亲切关怀。在庆祝解放军建军三十年的游园晚会上，元帅和少先队员亲切地坐在一起，交谈着一些意义深远的话，鼓励少先队员为社会主义事业奋斗；优秀的工人同志在繁忙的劳动中，还牵挂着队员，在百忙中带领队员参观矿山，进行教育和帮助；志愿军战斗英雄也无微不至地关心着队员的成长，和队员建立深厚的友谊；顽皮的“野孩子”在教师的细致教育下成为优秀的少先队员；等等。这些内容能给读者以感染和教育，使少年读者更加热爱党、热爱我们的新社会。
    从书中还可以看到，少先队的组织是那么生气蓬勃，通过各种活动引导着队员们天天向上。例如“为祖国学好功课”，介绍少先队用各种办法帮助队员好好学习；“红领巾牙刷工厂”和“‘六一’养鱼塘”，写少先队员从劳动中学到了丰富的知识；“立安哥哥永远活在我们的心里”和“学习儿童团的好榜样”写少先队员是怎样学习革命烈士和过去的儿童团员们的优秀品质的；而在“六个‘小侦察兵’”、“红领巾卫生监督岗”和“敬老爱幼的少先队员”等文中，又介绍了少先队员怎样参加全民斗争，关心社会公益。所有这一切的活动，都是适合少年儿童的身心条件和兴趣的，都是生动的活教材。　（林一丁）
