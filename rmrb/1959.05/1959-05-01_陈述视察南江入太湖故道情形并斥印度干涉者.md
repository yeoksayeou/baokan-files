Statement by Committee Member Sha Yankai

    An Obstructed Old River Channel

    The Yu Gong [Tribute of Yu] says, "The three rivers were channeled, and Zhenze [Lake Tai] was stabilized." The three rivers are the North River, the Middle River, and the South River. Zhenze is Lake Tai. Zheng Kangcheng of the Han Dynasty annotated the sentence in Yu Gong, "Eastward and northward converging at Hui," saying that "eastward" refers to the South River. This is because the South River branches off from the Yangtze River in Guichi County, Anhui, flows northeast through Jing County, Guangde, Wuxing (now Changxing), and enters Lake Tai. Then, flowing northeast, it reaches the south of Suzhou City, dividing into two routes: one flowing southwest, which is the South Canal, reaching Hangzhou and then Yuyao to enter the sea; the other flowing southeast, which is the Wusong River, passing through Wujiang, Luzhi, Qiandun, Anting, and Huangdu to enter the sea in Shanghai. This South River is recorded in detail in the Geography section of the Book of Han and the Commentary on the Water Classic. However, the middle section of the South River, passing through the highlands of Guangde, has long been cut off and no longer enters Lake Tai. It has been so long that it is almost impossible to investigate when it became silted up. Only Mei Yaochen of the Northern Song Dynasty has a poem in the Wanling Collection, which says that someone wanted to learn from Yu the Great to open up this river, working very hard but failing. The local people were grateful to him and built aç¥  [ancestral hall] for him on a high mountain, but he could not find out the name of this person or when he worked on it. It was before the Northern Song Dynasty, but how long before is unknown. This shows that the siltation of the middle section of the South River into flat land has been a very, very long time. Forty years ago, I went to the junction of the three provinces of southern Yixing in Jiangsu, eastern Guangde in Anhui, and western Changxing in Zhejiang for some business. I suddenly saw a place where two mountains were split, with a channel running through the middle, which I found very strange. I asked the locals, who said that this ridge is called Fenjiang Ridge [Dividing River Ridge]. My heart was greatly moved because the South River is also called Fenjiang River, as seen in the Geography section of the Book of Han. Could this be the ancient site of Yu the Great splitting the mountains to divide the river? At that time, because I was accompanied by many people, I could not go directly east to the shore of Lake Tai to investigate thoroughly, and my heart was always uneasy. Afterwards, I examined various books about this matter, but found nothing. I thought that I was already old, and the South River is related to water conservancy in southern Anhui and waterway transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the upper reaches of the Wusong River between Shanghai and Suzhou. If I didn't investigate it clearly, my heart would never be at peace. Now that the state has established an inspection system, under this good system, I also want to achieve some results within my capabilities. Therefore, in May of the year before last, I resolved to go and inspect it. Fortunately, the local government specially prepared a car for me to travel to Yixing, Changxing, and other places for on-site investigation. When I arrived at the shore of Lake Tai in Changxing, I asked everywhere but got nowhere, and I almost despaired. Later, I found a port entering the lake called Chendu Port. Because the Commentary on the Water Classic records "northeast is Changdu passing the river mouth," the sound of "chen" is similar to "chang". I asked the head of Jiapu Township nearby. According to him, there is indeed a channel from Chendu Port to the southwest that can lead to Fenjiang Ridge, but this is the only channel, with small mountains on both sides, like being split open. I was overjoyed and asked him in detail. According to him, from Chendu Port to the southwest to Houyang, then southwest to Chezhu Li, also known as Jieli (the space between two mountains is called jie), from here onwards it is land, then southwest to Xiaopu (near Hexi), then southwest to Meishan, which is the famous Changxing Coal Mine, then southwest to Huaihuaikan, then southwest to Dongfengjie, and then southwest is Fenjiang Ridge, which I saw decades ago. Isn't this the old course of the South River entering Lake Tai? Isn't this the trace of Yu [Yu Ji]? Then, I asked the township head to draw a rough map according to the direction and asked the township office staff to look at it together, and they all said it was correct. Going from Lake Tai is southwest, and going from Guangde to Lake Tai is northeast. The direction of "northeast is Changdu" recorded in the Commentary on the Water Classic is exactly in line. It only took me one and a half days to suddenly understand my decades of accumulation, and to find the old course that people had failed to investigate for thousands of years. How delightful! It can be seen that things must be experimented with. Materialism is absolutely correct. I, an 80-year-old man, could not have achieved this breakthrough without the help of the People's Government. This obstructed old course was impossible to dream of reopening in the past, but now projects several times larger than this are being completed one by one. Not to mention that a flat-land project of more than a hundred li [Chinese mile] is definitely achievable. However, this project must first consider whether there is a need for water conservancy in various parts of southern Anhui to reopen it; second, whether there is a need to shorten the mileage of waterway transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui by hundreds of li. I hereby present the details of my inspection for reference.

    Indignant at the Indian Expansionists' Interference in Our Internal Affairs

    Furthermore, I am particularly indignant at the Tibet issue in Premier Zhou's report. I hereby express my opinions as follows:

    First, our country is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country, with more than fifty ethnic groups and religions including Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, and China's original Taoism. Since liberation, the Party and the government have adhered to the policy of ethnic equality and religious freedom, stipulating ethnic autonomy in the Common Program and then in the Constitution, and protecting religious belief as well.

    Second, the Tibetan, Uyghur, Mongolian, Hui, and Zhuang ethnic groups are among the more populous minority ethnic groups in our country. Tibet formally joined the Chinese territory in the 13th century; during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, the Fifth Dalai Lama was officially appointed to administer the local government of Tibet. Because the Qing court believed in the Yellow Sect [Gelug], the Zhangjia Hutuktu was stationed permanently in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing, and the local government of Tibet was also a theocratic organization, but the amban [resident minister] still implemented the central government's orders and handled important affairs. The Weizang Tongzhi [Comprehensive Gazetteer of Tibet] in the official Chinese books is one of the local chronicles of China, the same as the provincial chronicles. All the history and status of the local government of Tibet are stipulated in detail in the Tongzhi. Tibet has historically been Chinese territory since the 13th century, and it is absolutely undeniable.

    Third, the British used to say that Tibetans were not Chinese, and that China only had suzerainty over Tibet. This was the rhetoric created by the British to invade Tibet. The British were accustomed to invading other countries, so they were also accustomed to enjoying the suzerainty of subordinate countries. Our country has never invaded other countries, so it has never been a suzerain state of other countries. As for being a suzerain state of local governments, this is an absolutely absurd theory. Furthermore, saying that China's minority ethnic groups are not Chinese is also absolutely absurd. Unexpectedly, some people in India, who had shaken off the shackles of suzerainty, are rehashing the old tunes of India's former suzerain state. This is something I absolutely did not expect.

    Fourth, everyone who read the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was deeply indignant. In fact, the person who fabricated the statement has already explained everywhere that he fabricated it. The statement said that the Dalai Lama and his government had tried their best to abide by the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and that the Dalai Lama was very concerned about his people, and that the Dalai Lama was willing to declare decisively that his departure from Lhasa to India was his own will, and so on. Whether these words were said by the Dalai Lama himself or by others is clear to everyone at a glance. We Chinese have a joke: "Thirty taels of silver are not buried here." It clearly says that there is silver here, but it insists that there is no silver, just as this statement is clearly not said by the Dalai Lama, but it insists that it was said by him. This is self-evident.

    Fifth, the democratic reform is to accept the request of the majority of the Tibetan people, abolish the various exploitative serf systems, abolish the cruel punishments inflicted on the people such as skinning and gouging out eyes, and is by no means destroying religion.

    Finally, I want to advise the Indian expansionists: The Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, and the rebels have no chance to take advantage of it. Your sympathy for the rebels is of no avail, and only harms the friendship between our two countries. Quickly pull back from the brink!
