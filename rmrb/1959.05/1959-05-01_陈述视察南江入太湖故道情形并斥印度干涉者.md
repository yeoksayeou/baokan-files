Statement by Committee Member Sha Yankai

    An Obstructed Old River Channel

    The Yu Gong [Tribute of Yu] says, "The three rivers were channeled, and Zhenze [Lake Tai] was stabilized." The three rivers are the North River, the Middle River, and the South River. Zhenze is Lake Tai. Zheng Kangcheng of the Han Dynasty annotated the sentence in Yu Gong, "Eastward and northward converging at Hui," saying that "eastward" refers to the South River. This is because the South River branches off from the Yangtze River in Guichi County, Anhui, flows northeast through Jing County, Guangde, Wuxing (now Changxing), and enters Lake Tai. Then, flowing northeast, it reaches the south of Suzhou City, dividing into two routes: one flowing southwest, which is the South Canal, reaching Hangzhou and then Yuyao to enter the sea; the other flowing southeast, which is the Wusong River, passing through Wujiang, Luzhi, Qiandun, Anting, and Huangdu to enter the sea in Shanghai. This South River is recorded in detail in the Geography section of the Book of Han and the Commentary on the Water Classic. However, the middle section of the South River, passing through the highlands of Guangde, has long been cut off and no longer enters Lake Tai. It has been so long that it is almost impossible to investigate when it became silted up. Only Mei Yaochen of the Northern Song Dynasty has a poem in the Wanling Collection, which says that someone wanted to learn from Yu the Great to open up this river, working very hard but failing. The local people were grateful to him and built a祠 [ancestral hall] for him on a high mountain, but he could not find out the name of this person or when he worked on it. It was before the Northern Song Dynasty, but how long before is unknown. This shows that the siltation of the middle section of the South River into flat land has been a very, very long time. Forty years ago, I went to the junction of the three provinces of southern Yixing in Jiangsu, eastern Guangde in Anhui, and western Changxing in Zhejiang for some business. I suddenly saw a place where two mountains were split, with a channel running through the middle, which I found very strange. I asked the locals, who said that this ridge is called Fenjiang Ridge [Dividing River Ridge]. My heart was greatly moved because the South River is also called Fenjiang River, as seen in the Geography section of the Book of Han. Could this be the ancient site of Yu the Great splitting the mountains to divide the river? At that time, because I was accompanied by many people, I could not go directly east to the shore of Lake Tai to investigate thoroughly, and my heart was always uneasy. Afterwards, I examined various books about this matter, but found nothing. I thought that I was already old, and the South River is related to water conservancy in southern Anhui and waterway transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the upper reaches of the Wusong River between Shanghai and Suzhou. If I didn't investigate it clearly, my heart would never be at peace. Now that the state has established an inspection system, under this good system, I also want to achieve some results within my capabilities. Therefore, in May of the year before last, I resolved to go and inspect it. Fortunately, the local government specially prepared a car for me to travel to Yixing, Changxing, and other places for on-site investigation. When I arrived at the shore of Lake Tai in Changxing, I asked everywhere but got nowhere, and I almost despaired. Later, I found a port entering the lake called Chendu Port. Because the Commentary on the Water Classic records "northeast is Changdu passing the river mouth," the sound of "chen" is similar to "chang". I asked the head of Jiapu Township nearby. According to him, there is indeed a channel from Chendu Port to the southwest that can lead to Fenjiang Ridge, but this is the only channel, with small mountains on both sides, like being split open. I was overjoyed and asked him in detail. According to him, from Chendu Port to the southwest to Houyang, then southwest to Chezhu Li, also known as Jieli (the space between two mountains is called jie), from here onwards it is land, then southwest to Xiaopu (near Hexi), then southwest to Meishan, which is the famous Changxing Coal Mine, then southwest to Huaihuaikan, then southwest to Dongfengjie, and then southwest is Fenjiang Ridge, which I saw decades ago. Isn't this the old course of the South River entering Lake Tai? Isn't this the trace of Yu [Yu Ji]? Then, I asked the township head to draw a rough map according to the direction and asked the township office staff to look at it together, and they all said it was correct. Going from Lake Tai is southwest, and going from Guangde to Lake Tai is northeast. The direction of "northeast is Changdu" recorded in the Commentary on the Water Classic is exactly in line. It only took me one and a half days to suddenly understand my decades of accumulation, and to find the old course that people had failed to investigate for thousands of years. How delightful! It can be seen that things must be experimented with. Materialism is absolutely correct. I, an 80-year-old man, could not have achieved this breakthrough without the help of the People's Government. This obstructed old course was impossible to dream of reopening in the past, but now projects several times larger than this are being completed one by one. Not to mention that a flat-land project of more than a hundred li [Chinese mile] is definitely achievable. However, this project must first consider whether there is a need for water conservancy in various parts of southern Anhui to reopen it; second, whether there is a need to shorten the mileage of waterway transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui by hundreds of li. I hereby present the details of my inspection for reference.

    Indignant at the Indian Expansionists' Interference in Our Internal Affairs

    Furthermore, I am particularly indignant at the Tibet issue in Premier Zhou's report. I hereby express my opinions as follows:

    First, our country is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country, with more than fifty ethnic groups and religions including Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, and China's original Taoism. Since liberation, the Party and the government have adhered to the policy of ethnic equality and religious freedom, stipulating ethnic autonomy in the Common Program and then in the Constitution, and protecting religious belief as well.

    Second, the Tibetan, Uyghur, Mongolian, Hui, and Zhuang ethnic groups are among the more populous minority ethnic groups in our country. Tibet formally joined the Chinese territory in the 13th century; during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, the Fifth Dalai Lama was officially appointed to administer the local government of Tibet. Because the Qing court believed in the Yellow Sect [Gelug], the Zhangjia Hutuktu was stationed permanently in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing, and the local government of Tibet was also a theocratic organization, but the amban [resident minister] still implemented the central government's orders and handled important affairs. The Weizang Tongzhi [Comprehensive Gazetteer of Tibet] in the official Chinese books is one of the local chronicles of China, the same as the provincial chronicles. All the history and status of the local government of Tibet are stipulated in detail in the Tongzhi. Tibet has historically been Chinese territory since the 13th century, and it is absolutely undeniable.

    Third, the British used to say that Tibetans were not Chinese, and that China only had suzerainty over Tibet. This was the rhetoric created by the British to invade Tibet. The British were accustomed to invading other countries, so they were also accustomed to enjoying the suzerainty of subordinate countries. Our country has never invaded other countries, so it has never been a suzerain state of other countries. As for being a suzerain state of local governments, this is an absolutely absurd theory. Furthermore, saying that China's minority ethnic groups are not Chinese is also absolutely absurd. Unexpectedly, some people in India, who had shaken off the shackles of suzerainty, are rehashing the old tunes of India's former suzerain state. This is something I absolutely did not expect.

    Fourth, everyone who read the so-called Dalai Lama's statement was deeply indignant. In fact, the person who fabricated the statement has already explained everywhere that he fabricated it. The statement said that the Dalai Lama and his government had tried their best to abide by the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and that the Dalai Lama was very concerned about his people, and that the Dalai Lama was willing to declare decisively that his departure from Lhasa to India was his own will, and so on. Whether these words were said by the Dalai Lama himself or by others is clear to everyone at a glance. We Chinese have a joke: "Thirty taels of silver are not buried here." It clearly says that there is silver here, but it insists that there is no silver, just as this statement is clearly not said by the Dalai Lama, but it insists that it was said by him. This is self-evident.

    Fifth, the democratic reform is to accept the request of the majority of the Tibetan people, abolish the various exploitative serf systems, abolish the cruel punishments inflicted on the people such as skinning and gouging out eyes, and is by no means destroying religion.

    Finally, I want to advise the Indian expansionists: The Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, and the rebels have no chance to take advantage of it. Your sympathy for the rebels is of no avail, and only harms the friendship between our two countries. Quickly pull back from the brink!

    陈述视察南江入太湖故道情形并斥印度干涉者
    沙彦楷委员的发言
    一条堙塞的故河道
    禹贡云：“三江既入，震泽底定”。三江就是北江、中江、南江，震泽就是太湖。汉朝郑康成注禹贡东迤北会于汇一句说，东迤者为南江。因为南江在安徽贵池县从大江分出，东北流经过泾县，广德、吴兴（今为长兴）等处，而入太湖。再东北流就到苏州城南，分两道：一道西南流，就是南运河，到杭州再到余姚入海；一道东南流，就是吴淞江，经过吴江甪直千墩安亭黄渡到上海入海。这条南江在汉书地理志及水经注都有详细的记载，可是南江中段经过广德高地，早已绝流，不复入太湖，为时很久，几乎无从考查是何时淤塞的，只有北宋梅尧臣有一首诗载宛陵集，诗中说，有人要学夏禹开通此江，用力甚勤而不能通，当地人民感激他，为立祠高山之上，可是他也没有考得此人的姓名，在什么时候用力开过的，是在北宋之前又不知隔了多少时候，可见南江中段之淤塞为平地，是很久很久的了。本人在四十年前，因事到江苏宜兴之南，安徽广德之东，浙江长兴之西三省交界处，忽见一处两山劈分，中通一道，深为奇怪。问之土人，这个岭叫分江岭。心大动。因为南江又名分江水，见于地理志，莫非这就是夏禹劈山分江的古迹么？当时因有多人牵缀，未能向东直行到太湖滨以穷究竟，心常耿耿。嗣后为此事遍考各书，一无所得，因念我年已笃老，而南江关系皖南水利及苏浙皖水道运输，又为上海苏州间的吴淞江上游，若不考究一个明白，心终不安。现值国家定立视察制度，在这种好制度下，也想就各人能力所及，得出一些成绩，遂于前年五月发奋前往视察，幸承地方政府为我特备小汽车代步往宜兴、长兴等处，实地考察。到达长兴湖滨，到处访问，不得要领，几乎绝望。后来访到一个入湖港口，叫沉渎港。因为水经注内有东北为长渎历河口的记载，沉与长声相近，去问就近的夹浦乡乡长，据他说，从沉渎港往西南，确有一条通道可以通到分江岭，但是也只有这一条通道，两旁都是小山，像劈开的样子。心大喜，就详细问他，据他说，从沉渎港往西南到后漾，再西南到车渚里，又名岕里（两山之间曰岕），自此以上就是陆路，又西南到筱浦（附近为合溪），又西南为煤山，就是著名的长兴煤矿，又西南为槐花磡，又西南为东峰岕，再西南就是我数十年前所见的分江岭了。这不是南江入太湖的故道么，这不是禹迹么？再请乡长按方向为略图邀合乡办事人同看，都称不错。从太湖上去是西南，从广德下太湖正是东北，水经注所载东北为长渎的方向，正是相符。仅费一天半的工夫，居然能使我四十年的积想，一旦明白，并将古人数千年考查不出故道，一旦觅得，岂不大快。可见事要实验。唯物主义是绝对不错的。我八十余岁的人，非依赖人民政府的帮助，绝对不能有此创获。这段堙塞的故道，从前是梦想也不能再开的，现在是比这个大好几倍的工程，一一依次成就，不要说是百余里的平地工程一定是可以做到的。但是这一段工程第一要看皖南各地在水利上是否有要求重开的必要；第二是苏浙皖水道运输缩短数百里的里程，是否有此必要。谨将视察所得情形详细陈述以备参考。
    为印度野心家干涉我内政而愤慨
    再，我听到周总理报告中的西藏事件，特别愤慨，特陈述意见如下：
    第一，我国为多民族多宗教的国家，民族共有五十多个，宗教有佛教、天主、基督、伊斯兰各教和中国原有的道教等。自解放以来，党和政府坚持了民族平等和宗教自由政策，将民族自治规定于共同纲领，复规定于宪法，保护宗教信仰亦同。
    第二，藏族与维吾尔族、蒙古族、回族、僮族同为我国少数民族中人数较多的民族。而西藏在十三世纪时就正式加入了中国版图；在清代康熙年间便册封第五世达赖喇嘛主管西藏地方政府。因为清廷信奉黄教，所以北京的雍和宫有章佳呼图克图长驻，而西藏的地方政府亦为政教合一的组织，但仍由驻藏大臣执行中央政令和办理要政。中国官书卫藏通志为中国地方志之一，与各省通志相同，所有西藏地方政府的历史及地位通志内，都有详细规定。西藏地方自十三世纪以来历来为中国领土，绝对不容否认。
    第三，英国人从前说西藏人不是中国人，又说中国对西藏只有宗主权，这是英国人想侵略西藏造出这种不合历史不合法学的言论。英国人惯于侵略他国，所以也惯于享有附属国的宗主权。我国向来不侵略他国，所以也向来不做他国的宗主国。至于做地方政府的宗主国这是绝对不通的奇论。又说中国的少数民族不是中国人，这也是绝对不通的话。不料曾经摆脱宗主枷锁的印度的一些人。又把印度过去的宗主国的滥调来一个旧调重弹，这是我绝对想不到的事情。
    第四，所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，大家看了深为愤慨。其实假造声明的人已经处处说明是他假造的了。声明中说达赖喇嘛和他的政府曾经想尽方法来遵守十七条协议，又说达赖喇嘛很关心他的人民，又说，达赖喇嘛愿意断然声明离开拉萨到印度，是他自己意志等等。这许多话到底是达赖喇嘛自己说的，还是别人说的？是大家一看就明白的。我们中国有一个笑话：“此地无银三十两”，明明说此处有银，偏说无银，犹之，这种声明明明不是达赖喇嘛说的，而偏说是他说的。这可以不辩自明了。
    第五，民主改革是接受西藏人民大多数的请求，取消种种剥削的农奴制度，取消剥皮挖眼等加于人民的残酷刑罚，而绝不是摧残宗教。
    最后，我要忠告印度扩张主义分子：西藏的叛乱已经平息了，叛乱分子已无机可乘了，你们对叛乱分子的同情，无济于事，徒伤友邦感情，赶紧悬崖勒马吧！
