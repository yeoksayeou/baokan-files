Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 12th: Some Indian newspapers have recently published readers' letters emphasizing the necessity of maintaining friendship between China and India.

    The "Leader" newspaper published a long letter from Brage Bihari Lal on the 11th, saying that India could not afford to lose China's sympathy and goodwill. The letter advised Indians not to participate in the debate on the Tibet issue.

    The letter pointed out that some Indian newspapers fiercely attacked China, describing it as "imperialist" and as "crushing Tibet's freedom." Some writers and cartoonists have丑化Chinese leaders. The letter said: "We can and must avoid all these practices for the sake of continuing to develop friendship between India and China."

    The letter also said, "With Pakistan hostile to us for many years on the eastern and western borders, and with their unquestionable acceptance of aid and support from Western imperialism such as the United States and Britain, it would be utter madness for us to oppose our great friend China to the north." The letter incisively pointed out that when the United States and Britain attempted to get India to support the Tibetan rebellion and expressed "support" for India, "Let us not be deceived by their hypocritical praise."

    "Free Press" published a letter from F. M. Muktibodh on May 3rd. He said in the letter: "Some Indian political parties are clamoring about Tibetan affairs, attacking China's actions based on lofty moral standards. This demonstrates their political naivety." He said, "These rash remarks of theirs are damaging the Sino-Indian friendship, which is the pillar of Asian and world peace, a friendship we have all guaranteed."
    Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: New Delhi News: The Indian "Blitz" weekly published an article by its reporter A. Raghavan on May 2nd, condemning Western newspapers and pro-American factions in India for attempting to use the Tibetan rebellion to undermine Sino-Indian friendship and India's neutral foreign policy.

    The article said, "Western newspapers are unanimously determined to break India with China, instigate Mr. Nehru to tear up the Panchsheel, and finally force him to sign a joint defense treaty with the Pakistani dictator Ayub Khan."

    The article said, "One cannot ignore the conclusion reached by the 'Manchester Guardian,' the calm spokesman representing the interests of British imperialism, which said, 'A major power like India, with a leader respected by most of the world (especially Asian countries), need not be timid in front of China. If only India's position is considered, it may be the best policy for Nehru to take the lead in non-Communist Asia to launch a debate with the Chinese government and file a complaint with the United Nations.'"

    The article went on to point out, "This is not an occasional claim made by an occasional newspaper. Almost all the newspapers in the so-called free world are talking a lot about India's proposal to bring the Tibetan issue to the United Nations. A large number of newspaper commentaries are sent to reporters in Delhi through these newspapers' foreign propaganda departments."

    The article also said, "India's pro-American factions are using this opportunity to undermine India's independent foreign policy. Some important Indian newspapers have begun to advocate talks between Ayub Khan and Nehru." The article pointed out that Pakistan's proposal for a joint Indo-Pakistani defense is "nothing new" because "for some time now, American diplomats in India and Pakistan have been secretly discussing this malicious proposal in private living rooms." "People are dragging India into the Cold War through the back door."

    The article said, "The main purpose of the anti-China movement, with the active participation of members of the Indian People's Alliance and the People's Socialist Party, is to undermine Sino-Indian friendship—the shield of the Asian-African colonial people."

    The article revealed, "Some strange actions have already begun in Mussoorie." It said, "The former Tibetan King Lukhangwa, who has been active in Indian territory, has moved his headquarters from Kalimpong to Mussoorie. He has held a series of talks with the Dalai Lama."

    After pointing out that the Dalai Lama's brother, Gyalo Thondup, has also taken up residence in the Birla Building, the article said, "Recently, in Tezpur, a reporter abruptly asked Mr. Thondup what he ostensibly relied on for a living. Mr. Thondup was taken aback and dared not answer the question. It is believed that for several years, he has established extensive connections with the West—especially the Americans."

    However, the article also said, "China should understand the instinctive sense of insecurity aroused in India by the undermining of Tibetan autonomy."

    The author of the article said, "The Chinese would not want India and China to hold talks on the Tibetan issue" because China "does not consider Tibet an independent country," but the author said, "There is every urgent reason to demand that India and China hold a meeting."

### 印度报纸刊登的一些读者来信说  维护印中两国友谊非常必要  “闪电”周报谴责西方报刊和印亲美派的破坏活动

    印度报纸刊登的一些读者来信说
    维护印中两国友谊非常必要
    “闪电”周报谴责西方报刊和印亲美派的破坏活动
    新华社新德里12日电  印度的一些报刊最近刊载的一些读者来信强调指出维护中印两国友谊的必要性。
    “领袖报”在11日刊载布腊季·比哈里·拉尔写的一封长信说，失去中国的同情和好意，印度是受不了的。这封信劝告印度人绝不要参预西藏事件的争论。
    这封信指出，印度的一些报纸猛烈攻击中国，把中国说成是“帝国主义”，说成是在“粉碎西藏的自由”。有一些作家和漫画家丑化中国的领导人，信中说：“我们能够而且必须为了印中两国继续发展友谊的利益而避免采取所有这些做法”。
    信中又说，“在巴基斯坦多年来一直在东部和西部边境敌视我们的情况下，在他们无庸置疑地接受美英等西方帝国主义的援助和支持的情况下，我们去反对我们北面的伟大朋友中国，那完全是发疯了”。这封信一针见血地指出：在美英两国企图使印度支持西藏叛乱而表示“支持”印度的时候，“让我们不要受它们这种虚伪的赞扬的欺骗”。
    “自由新闻”5月3日发表了符·姆·穆克提博德的来信。他在信中说：“印度一些政党就西藏事务发出叫嚣，攻击中国根据崇高的道德标准而采取的行动。这表现了它们政治上的幼稚。”他说，“它们这些轻率的言论正在损害着作为亚洲和世界和平的支柱的印中友谊，这种友谊是我们大家都作了保证的”
    新华社13日讯  新德里消息：印度“闪电”周报5月2日刊载了该报记者阿·拉加凡写的一篇文章，谴责西方报纸和印度亲美派企图利用西藏叛乱事件破坏印中友谊和印度的中立外交政策。
    这篇文章说，“西方报纸一致决心使印度同中国破裂，唆使尼赫鲁先生撕毁潘查希拉，并最后迫使他同巴基斯坦的独裁者阿尤布汗签订共同防御条约。”
    文章说，“人们却不能不理会代表英帝国主义利益的沉着的代言人‘曼彻斯特卫报’所下的结论，它说，‘像印度这样一个有着一个受到世界大部分国家（特别是亚洲国家）尊敬的领袖的大国，在中国面前没有必要胆怯。如果只考虑印度的地位，尼赫鲁在非共产党亚洲带头向中国政府发起论战并且向联合国提出控告，这样做可能是上策。’”
    文章接着指出，“这并不是偶尔一家报纸偶然提出的主张。几乎所谓自由世界的所有报纸都在大事谈论印度向联合国提出西藏问题的建议。大量的报纸评论经由这些报纸的对外宣传部寄给德里的记者们”。
    这篇文章还说，“印度的亲美派利用这次机会破坏印度的独立外交政策。某些重要的印度报纸已经开始主张由阿尤布汗和尼赫鲁举行会谈”。文章指出，巴基斯坦提出的印巴共同防御的建议“并不是什么新的主张”因为“好些时候以来，在印度和巴基斯坦的美国外交家们，一直在私人客厅里秘密讨论这个恶毒的主张”。“人们正在从后门把印度拖入冷战中去”。
    文章说，“有印度人民同盟盟员和人民社会党人积极参加的反华运动的主要目的是破坏中印友谊——亚非殖民地人民的盾牌。”
    这篇文章透露，“已经在穆索里开始采取一些奇怪的行动。”它说，“一直在印度领土活动的前藏王鲁康娃已经把他的总部从噶伦堡迁往穆索里。他已经同达赖喇嘛举行了一系列会谈。”
    这篇文章在指出达赖喇嘛的哥哥嘉乐登珠也已经在比拉大厦居住下来这一事实以后说，“最近，在提斯浦尔，有一个记者唐突地问登珠先生他表面上依靠什么为生。登珠先生大吃一惊，不敢回答这个问题。据信，若干年来，他已同西方——特别是美国人——建立了广泛的联系。”
    但是，这篇文章又说，“中国应该了解，由于西藏自治受到破坏而在印度引起的本能的不安全感”。
    这篇文章的作者说，“中国人不会希望印度和中国就西藏问题举行会谈”，因为中国“认为西藏不是一个独立的国家”，但是作者却又说，“有一切迫切的理由要求印度和中国举行一次会谈。”
