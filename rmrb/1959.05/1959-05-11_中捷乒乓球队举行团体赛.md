Xinhua News Agency, 10th – The Czechoslovakian national men's and women's table tennis teams held two friendly team matches with the Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams in Beijing tonight. The Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams won with scores of 5-0 and 3-0 respectively.

The visiting and home teams demonstrated two distinctly different playing styles tonight. The Czechoslovakian players all use a shakehand grip, specializing in chopping near the table, defensive strokes, and coordinated sharp, fast counter-attacks. The Chinese players all use a penhold grip, employing tactics of aggressive forehand smashes and drives, combined with backhand blocking.

In the fourth match of the men's team event, the contest between Czechoslovakian player Vinařovský and Rong Guotuan was fierce. Rong Guotuan won the first game 21-11. In the second game, Vinařovský's counter-attacks were particularly outstanding, with speed so fast that Rong Guotuan often couldn't react in time, resulting in Vinařovský winning the game 21-10. The third game was even more intense. Rong Guotuan adopted a tactic of serving and attacking, and aggressively smashing to the left and right corners of his opponent, finally winning with a score of 21-18.

The specific results of the other four matches in the men's team event tonight were:
　　Yang Ruihua won against Vinařovský 2-0
　　Rong Guotuan won against Polakovič 2-0
　　Xu Yinsheng won against Štípek 2-1
