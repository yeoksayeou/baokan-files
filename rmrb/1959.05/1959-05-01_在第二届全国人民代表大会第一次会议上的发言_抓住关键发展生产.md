Speech at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress
Grasp the Key to Developing Production
Speech by Delegate Chen Yu
Fellow Delegates, Comrades:

Premier Zhou's report is an epic of the Great Leap Forward and a bugle call to encourage another leap forward. We, the Guangdong delegation, fully endorse it, and we also fully agree with the other reports. Now, I will report to the Congress on the work situation in Guangdong Province.

1958 was a glorious and brilliant year. Under the illumination of the General Line, and encouraged by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, Guangdong Province also achieved unprecedentedly great victories.

The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in Guangdong Province, like that in other parts of the country, started with agriculture. Thanks to the guidance of the Party's General Line for building socialism, agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output for the year more than doubled compared with 1957, and the growth rate of other agricultural and sideline products was also very large. The total agricultural output value in 1958 was 6.1 billion yuan, an increase of 80 percent over 1957.

The agricultural Great Leap Forward in 1958 not only created huge material wealth but also initially learned a set of methods for organizing and leading the Great Leap Forward, and gained a series of experiences in carrying out mass movements. It enriched and supplemented the content of agricultural technological innovation in implementing the eight-point charter for agriculture summarized by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. This is of extremely significant importance for guiding the future development of agricultural production.

The most important achievement in industry is that a certain heavy industrial base was established after the mass movement of the whole people making steel. Guangdong Province basically did not produce steel in the past, coal production was also very small, and in terms of machinery, it was previously unable to produce large-scale and complete sets of equipment. After the efforts of last year, this backward situation has begun to change. Last year, the total industrial output value reached 6.7 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 100 percent over the previous year. The annual steel production reached 200,500 tons (including 160,000 tons of native steel), an increase of 81 times. Coal was more than 3.39 million tons, an increase of nearly 3 times. 1,500 metal cutting machine tools were produced, an increase of more than 19 times. Although the absolute figures for these products are still very small compared to the advanced industrial areas of the country, they represent a major change for Guangdong. The experience of mobilizing the masses gained in industrial production last year is extremely important for guiding future industrial production. The total amount of investment in capital construction completed last year was about 1 billion yuan (including commune investment), an increase of 1.66 times. More than 1,000 new and expanded enterprises were built, some of which were projects above the quota. Light industry, especially sugar and salt, has also developed greatly.

The Party's leadership over cultural, educational, scientific, and health work has been greatly strengthened. Last year, 45 new colleges and universities and 1,388 middle schools were built. The number of students in colleges and universities and primary and secondary schools has increased greatly, and the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached 92 percent. The number of full-time researchers in provincial scientific institutions has doubled. The number of medical and preventive institutions has increased by more than two times, and a medical and health network has been basically established throughout the province. Other work has also achieved great success. Therefore, we say that 1958 was a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward.

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, people's mental outlook has been completely renewed, they are full of energy and high spirits.

The most important reason for achieving such great success in 1958 is that we have the Party's General Line for building socialism as our guide. Workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, patriotic overseas Chinese, and all democratic parties have all given play to their initiative under the encouragement of the General Line, and have played their respective roles in various positions. The people of the province have become more united.

Since last year, people's mental outlook has also undergone profound changes. The people of Guangdong have a strong desire to quickly change the state of "poverty and blankness," and because Guangdong was invaded and oppressed by imperialism the earliest, and is still adjacent to the capitalist world, this desire is particularly strong. Therefore, once people have mastered the ideological weapon of the General Line, they become high-spirited and full of energy, creating countless miracles. More than a year ago, no one dared to imagine that the target for increasing grain production for 1967 would be overfulfilled in 1958; no one dared to imagine that some heavy industrial bases would be laid in Guangdong, a province with no heavy industrial base, within a year; no one dared to imagine that a comprehensive Great Leap Forward would be achieved while taking grain and steel as the key links. However, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of Guangdong not only thought so, but also did it, and did it well. This has made people's mental outlook completely new. No superstition, no conservatism, wholeheartedly, by all means, struggling hard to complete socialist construction in all aspects more, faster, better, and more economically, this is the common will of the broad masses.

What is particularly important is that on the basis of the great development of industrial and agricultural production and the great improvement of people's ideological awareness, the province has realized the people's communeization. The province's 35 million rural population has been organized into more than 770 people's communes. Once the people's commune was established, it immediately showed unparalleled superiority and strong vitality. The scope of socialist collective ownership is wider and the degree is higher, labor and means of production can be more rationally deployed and used, the content of production is richer than before, the speed of production development is faster, and public canteens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly are being established everywhere. This has created a completely new scene in the countryside. In particular, after the implementation of the "eating without money, paying wages monthly" distribution system in the rural areas of the province, the peasants who have been worried about food and clothing all day long for thousands of years have ended the days of no basic living security and have obtained the most reliable social insurance. This is the best thing that has never happened since the beginning of the world. Therefore, the broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, generally warmly support the people's commune. They put all their hopes and future on the people's commune.

Great development of production, great leap forward in ideology, and people's communeization, combined together, have created an extremely favorable situation in Guangdong, which is a situation that can realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Our task is to consolidate and develop this situation and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

At present, the province is engaged in a new battle. The main task of the people of the province this year is to actively strive to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan centered on the four major targets.

Under this guideline, we must first grasp grain production, which is still the central task of the province at present. Only in this way can we better develop industry, gradually meet the people's need for grain and store sufficient grain, and let go of developing diversified operations in agriculture and gradually realize the cultivation system of less planting, high yield, more harvest, and gardenization of cultivation. While vigorously grasping grain production, we must also implement the policy of combining grain with diversified operations. Guangdong Province has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, which is particularly suitable for the growth of cash crops. We are seizing this favorable condition to greatly develop cash crops and other sideline production. The Central Committee has determined that Guangdong is a key area for the development of the sugar industry, which is a great encouragement to the people of Guangdong. We have decided to vigorously develop sugarcane production this year, with a planting area of 2.5 million mu, requiring an average yield of 15,000 jin per mu. Second, vigorously develop fruit and silk and hemp production. This year, we require all fruits to have a bumper harvest, and at the same time appropriately expand the planting area, and develop another 3 million mu of fruit. Mulberry silkworms are set at 400,000 mu. Hemp is 1.2 million mu, and other things like oil crops and animal husbandry are also actively developing. Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula are extremely suitable for the development of tropical crops such as rubber, lemongrass, pineapple, sisal hemp, coffee, and cocoa. These areas have already achieved self-sufficiency in grain, which creates the necessary prerequisites for vigorously developing tropical crops. For this reason, it has been decided that Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula will implement the policy of combining grain and tropical crops. We deeply know that vigorously developing cash crops can not only increase the wealth of the people of Guangdong and enrich people's lives, but also is a glorious responsibility to the whole country. We should supply the country with more rubber, sugar, fruits, fish, other cash crops, and silk fabrics. In terms of industry, Guangdong's heavy industry base was very weak in the past, and without a certain heavy industry base, it is impossible to better develop light industry and agriculture. For this reason, we are actively developing steel, coal, and transportation in order to strive to build Guangdong into an industrial province in two or three years. Guangdong Province has particularly good conditions for developing light industry. First, it has abundant resources. Sugarcane can be planted everywhere, and mulberry silkworms can be harvested more than eight times a year; the conditions for sea salt production are also extremely good; second, transportation is very convenient; third, Guangdong has a traditional habit of engaging in light industry and handicrafts. Therefore, Guangdong has special conditions for developing light industry, especially sugar making, silk reeling, canning, paper making, salt making, and other industries. Actively developing sugar making and silk and other industries can not only improve people's lives, but also accumulate a large amount of funds for the country. Based on this, we believe that on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, under the policy of developing heavy industry and light industry at the same time, Guangdong Province should devote more effort to developing light industry in the future. This year, it has been decided to produce 600,000 to 700,000 tons of sugar, 1.4 million tons of crude salt, and 1,300 tons of silk. Other work also has more ambitious plans this year than last year. At present, all fronts have happily and nervously entered a new battle.

Launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy and oppose waste, implement the "eight-character constitution" for agriculture, and victoriously complete this year's industrial and agricultural production tasks.

In order to victoriously complete this year's tasks, we believe that we must immediately launch a province-wide mass movement to increase production and practice economy in order to ideologically and politically mobilize the enthusiasm of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and every patriotic citizen to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan. The central link of this movement, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, should be to improve labor productivity, increase production, practice strict economy, and oppose waste. In order to victoriously carry out this movement, we must conscientiously mobilize the masses and do a good job in the second quarter, seizing the key opportunity to complete the annual plan. According to the situation in Guangdong Province, in terms of industry, under the principle of centralized leadership and overall arrangement, we should conscientiously grasp various organizational tasks, overcome the fuel barrier, the transportation barrier, and the technical barrier, so that production and capital construction work can be completed on time, in quantity, and with quality; in factories and mines, we must continue to implement the working method of combining centralized leadership with vigorously carrying out mass movements, and conscientiously carry out the technical revolution and technical innovation movement. In terms of agriculture, according to the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, the speed and magnitude of increased production directly depend on the degree of implementation of the "eight-character constitution" for agriculture. The "eight-character constitution" is a comprehensive basic measure. It is necessary to comprehensively apply and fully implement it, and to have different priorities according to the center of each period. At present, we are focusing on field management and topdressing, so that we can plant one piece well and manage one piece well. In order to ensure that crops have sufficient fertilizer, in addition to mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop local miscellaneous fertilizer, we also mobilized sugar factories, chemical factories, and salt factories to vigorously develop local chemical fertilizer, striving to produce about 1.5 million tons this year. Second, mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform, requiring labor productivity to double this year compared with last year. In terms of agricultural transportation, in addition to mobilizing the masses to actively improve existing transportation tools, the province has also decided to produce 500,000 better hand-pushed rubber-wheeled vehicles this year, which can replace about 1.5 million laborers. We believe that the series of methods for mobilizing the masses that were effective in industrial and agricultural production last year, such as leading cadres planting "experimental fields," cadres eating, living, and laboring with the masses, visiting and evaluating, and holding on-site meetings, must be adhered to in all work and improved.

Delegates, of course we will have difficulties in our work, but with the Party's General Line for building socialism, with a series of experiences in mobilizing the masses, and with such an advanced social base organization as the people's commune, any difficulties can be overcome. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the help of fraternal regions, relying on the people's commune, and giving play to the enthusiasm of all the people, Guangdong's work will surely achieve greater success this year.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Tibet issue. The former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, in order to maintain their serf-owner-style dark rule, did not hesitate to collude with imperialism and launched an armed rebellion that betrayed the motherland and undermined unity. This conspiracy has been shamefully defeated. However, recently a very strong wrong wind has blown in India, our neighboring country. Indian expansionists have long had territorial ambitions for Tibet and have carried out some unspeakable activities. After the failure of the Tibetan rebellion, they openly expressed "sympathy" for the Tibetan rebel group and slandered our government. We express our extreme indignation at this. We are especially indignant that some Indian officials and leaders of the Congress Party have even issued calls denying our country's sovereignty over Tibet and sympathizing with the rebels. I want to warn Indian expansionists that your attempt to undermine China's unity and interfere in China's internal affairs is absolutely impossible to succeed. If you insist on inheriting the mantle of British imperialism, you will surely be battered and bloodied.

All reactionaries at home and abroad are destined to fail. Similarly, on the Tibet issue, the victory will inevitably belong to the people of all ethnic groups in China. Let us make greater efforts for the victory of a democratic socialist new Tibet!

    在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的发言
    抓住关键发展生产
    陈郁代表的发言代表们、同志们：
    周总理的报告是总结大跃进的史诗，是鼓舞再跃进的号角。我们广东代表表示完全拥护、对其他几个报告也完全同意。现在我就广东省的工作情况向大会作如下汇报。
    一九五八年是光辉灿烂的一年。在总路线的照耀下，在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，广东省也同样取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    广东省的全面大跃进和全国各地一样，是从农业开始的。由于有了党的建设社会主义总路线的指引，使农业生产获得了空前的大丰收，全年粮食总产量比一九五七年翻了一番多，其他农副业产品的增长幅度也很大。一九五八年的农业总产值为六十一亿元，比一九五七年增长百分之八十。
    一九五八年农业大跃进不仅创造了巨大的物质财富，而且还初步学会了组织、领导大跃进的一套方法，取得了大搞群众运动的一系列的经验；在贯彻执行党中央和毛主席总结的农业八项增产措施中，丰富和充实了农业技术革新的内容。这对于指导今后农业生产的发展有极其重大的意义。
    工业方面最主要的成绩，是经过全民炼钢铁的群众运动后打下了一定的重工业基础。广东省过去基本上不产钢铁，煤的产量也很少，机械方面以往不能生产大型和全套的设备，经过去年的努力，这种落后面貌已经开始改变。去年工业总产值达到六十七亿元，比前年增长近一倍。钢的年产量达到二十万零五千吨（其中土钢十六万吨），增长了八十一倍。煤三百三十九万多吨，增长了近三倍。金属切削机床生产了一千五百台，增长了十九倍多。这些产品的绝对数字比起全国工业先进地区来虽然还很小，但是，对广东来说却是一个重大的变化。去年在工业生产中获得的发动群众的经验，对于指导今后工业生产有极其重要的作用。去年基本建设投资总额完成约十亿元（包括公社投资），增长了一点六六倍。新建扩建了一千多个企业，其中有些是限额以上的项目。轻工业特别是糖和盐也有很大的发展。
    党对文教科学卫生工作的领导已经大大加强，去年新建大专学校四十五所，中学一千三百八十八所。大专学校学生和中小学生都增加了很多，学龄儿童入学率已达百分之九十二。省级科学机构的专职研究人员增加了一倍。医疗预防机构增长了二倍多，全省已基本上建立了医药卫生网。其他工作也同样取得了很大成绩，因此，我们说，一九五八年是全面大跃进的一年。
    在党和毛主席的领导下，人们精神面貌焕然一新，干劲冲天，意气风发。
    一九五八年工作上能够获得这样伟大的胜利，最重要的原因在于有了党的建设社会主义总路线作指针。工人、农民、革命知识分子、爱国华侨、各民主党派都在总路线的鼓舞下发挥了积极性，在各种不同岗位上起了各自的作用，全省人民已经更加团结起来了。
    去年以来，人们的精神面貌也起了深刻的变化，广东人民对于迅速改变“一穷二白”的状况具有强烈的愿望，而且由于广东受帝国主义的侵略压迫最早，至今还和资本主义世界相接壤，这种愿望就显得特别强烈。因此，一旦人们掌握到了总路线的思想武器，就意气风发，干劲冲天，创造出无数奇迹。一年多以前，谁也不敢想像要在一九五八年超额完成一九六七年的粮食增产指标；谁也不敢想像要在一年之内，在广东这个毫无重工业基础的省份打下某些重工业基础；谁也不敢想像要在以粮为纲，以钢为纲的同时实现全面大跃进。但是，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，广东人民不仅这样想，而且做到了，做好了。这就使得人们的精神面貌焕然一新。不迷信，不保守，一心一意，千方百计，为更多更快更好更省地完成社会主义各个方面的建设事业而苦战，这就是广大群众的共同意志。
    特别重要的是在工农业生产大发展，人民思想觉悟大提高的基础上，全省实现了人民公社化。全省三千五百万农村人口，已经组织到七百七十多个人民公社之中。人民公社一经建立，就立即显示了无比的优越性和强大的生命力。社会主义集体所有制的范围更广、程度更高了，劳动力和生产资料可以更合理地调度和使用了，生产内容比以前更丰富了，生产发展的速度更快了，公共食堂、托儿所和敬老院到处兴办起来。这就使农村出现了一种全新的景象。特别是全省农村实行了“吃饭不要钱，按月发工资”的分配制度以后，几千年来终日为吃穿耽忧的农民，已经结束了基本生活无保障的日子，得到了最可靠的社会保险。这是盘古开天地以来从未有过的好事情。因此，广大群众特别是贫农和下中农普遍热烈拥护人民公社。他们把自己的希望和未来全部寄托到人民公社上面。
    生产大发展，思想大跃进，人民公社化，三者结合起来，就在广东造成了一种极为有利的形势，这就是可以实现更大、更好、更全面跃进的形势。我们的任务是要巩固和发展这个形势，实现今年更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    目前，全省正在进行着新的战斗，全省人民今年的主要任务，就是积极努力，为完成和超额完成以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    在这个方针下首先要抓好粮食生产，这仍然是当前全省的中心任务。因为只有这样，才能更好的发展工业，才能逐步满足人民的粮食需要和储备充足的粮食，才能放手地发展农业的多种经营和逐步实现少种、高产、多收和耕作园林化的耕作制度。在大力抓好粮食生产的同时，还要实行粮食与多种经营并举的方针。广东省气候温和，雨量充沛，特别适宜于经济作物的生长，我们正在抓住这个有利条件，大量发展经济作物和其他副业生产。中央已经确定广东为发展制糖工业的重点地区，这对广东人民是一个极大的鼓舞。我们决定今年大力发展甘蔗生产，种植面积确定为二百五十万亩，要求平均亩产一万五千斤。再次，大力发展水果和丝麻生产。今年要求所有水果都来一个丰收，同时适当扩大种植面积，再发展水果三百万亩。蚕桑确定为四十万亩。麻类一百二十万亩，其他像油料与畜牧业等也积极发展。海南岛和雷州半岛极适宜于发展橡胶、香茅草、菠萝、剑麻、咖啡、可可等热带作物。这些地区的粮食已经可以自给自足，这就为大搞热带作物创造了必要的前提。为此，决定海南岛和雷州半岛执行粮食和热带作物并举的方针。我们深深知道，大力发展经济作物不仅可以增加广东人民的财富，丰富人民的生活，而且也是对全国一项光荣的责任，我们应该向全国供应更多的橡胶、食糖、水果、鱼类，其他经济作物和丝织品。工业方面，广东省重工业基础过去十分薄弱，而要更好地发展轻工业和农业，没有一定的重工业基础是不成的，为此，我们正在积极发展钢铁、煤炭和交通运输业，以便争取在两三年内把广东省建设成为一个工业省份。广东省发展轻工业有特别好的条件，首先是资源丰富，甘蔗到处可以种植，蚕桑一年可收八次以上；海盐生产的条件也极其良好；其次，交通运输很方便；再次，广东历来有搞轻工业与工艺品的传统习惯。因之，在广东发展轻工业特别是制糖、缫丝、罐头、造纸、制盐等工业是有特殊条件的。积极发展制糖与蚕丝等工业，不仅可以提高人民的生活，而且还可以为国家积累大量的资金。据此，我们认为，在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行重工业和轻工业同时并举的方针下，广东省今后应该以更大的力量来发展轻工业。今年决定生产糖六十万到七十万吨，原盐一百四十万吨，蚕丝一千三百吨。其他工作，今年也有比去年更加宏伟的计划。目前，各个战线都已经愉快而又紧张地投入新的战斗中了。
    发动群众开展增产节约反对浪费，贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，胜利地完成今年工农业生产任务。
    为了胜利地完成今年的任务，我们认为，必须立即在全省开展一个增产节约的全民运动，以便从思想上政治上动员工人、农民、知识分子和每一个爱国公民的积极性，为完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划而奋斗。这个运动的中心环节，正如周总理报告中指出的，应当是提高劳动生产率，增加生产，厉行节约，反对浪费。为胜利地开展这个运动，必须认真发动群众，做好第二季度工作，紧紧抓住这个完成年度计划的关键时机。根据广东省的情况，工业方面应该在集中领导、全面安排的原则下，认真抓紧各项组织工作，过好燃料关、运输关和技术关，使生产和基本建设工作都能按时、按量、按质地完成任务；在厂矿企业里，必须继续贯彻集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的工作方法，认真开展技术革命和技术革新运动。在农业方面，根据去年大跃进的经验，增产的快慢、大小直接取决于贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的程度。“八字宪法”是综合性的基本措施，既要综合运用、全面贯彻，又要根据每个时期的中心有不同的重点。目前正在着重抓好田间管理和追肥，做到种好一块管好一块。为保证农作物有充足的肥料，除发动群众大搞土杂肥外，还动员糖厂、化工厂、盐厂大搞土化肥，争取今年生产一百五十万吨左右。其次，发动群众大搞工具改革，要求今年劳动生产率比去年提高一倍。在农业运输方面，除了发动群众积极改进现有运输工具之外，省还决定今年生产较好的手推胶轮车五十万部，这将可以代替一百五十万左右的劳动力。我们认为，去年在工农业生产中行之有效的领导干部种“试验田”干部同群众同吃同住同劳动，参观评比、召开现场会议等一系列发动群众的方法，必须在各项工作中坚持下去，并且加以提高。
    代表们，我们在工作中当然不会没有困难，但是，有了党的建设社会主义总路线，有了发动群众一系列的经验，有了人民公社这样先进的社会基础组织，是可以克服任何困难的。我们深信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在兄弟地区的帮助下，依靠人民公社，发挥全体人民的积极性，广东省的工作今年一定能够取得更大的胜利。
    最后，我就西藏问题说几句话，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团为了维护他们农奴主式的黑暗统治，不惜勾结帝国主义，发动了背叛祖国，破坏统一的武装暴乱，这个阴谋已经遭到可耻的失败。但是，最近在我国的邻邦印度却刮起了一阵很大的歪风，印度扩张主义者早就对西藏有扩张领土的野心，进行过一些不可告人的活动，他们在西藏叛乱事件失败之后，又公开表示“同情”西藏叛乱集团，污蔑我国政府，我们对此表示极大的愤慨。尤其愤慨的是印度某些官方人士和国大党领导人竟也发出了否认我国对西藏主权和同情叛乱分子的叫嚣，我要警告印度扩张主义者，你们想破坏中国的统一和干涉中国的内政，这是绝然不能得逞的。如果你们硬要继承英帝国主义的衣钵，那么就一定会碰得头破血流。
    一切国内外的反动派都注定要失败，同样，在西藏问题上，胜利的必然是中国的各族人民，让我们为民主的社会主义的新西藏的胜利而作更大的努力！
