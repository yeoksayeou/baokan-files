Comrades Chairman, Fellow Committee Members:

　　We listened to the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan at the plenary session of the committee, and attended the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and listened to the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and the Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959 made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian. We were greatly encouraged and felt extremely excited. We unanimously express our heartfelt support and are determined to implement them resolutely.

　　Since the liberation of our country in 1949, it will soon be the tenth anniversary. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the unremitting efforts of the people of the whole country, our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved brilliant victories. Especially in 1958, under the brilliant light of the General Line, our country has witnessed an unprecedented great leap forward in industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, education, health, and other aspects, and has achieved great accomplishments, greatly changing our country's "poor and blank" face. This thriving atmosphere shows the infinitely bright future of our country and makes our people feel excited! Feel proud!

　　Taking the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as an example, no one can doubt our country's Great Leap Forward in 1958. In Guangxi, under the brilliant light of the General Line, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and the unity and cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups, an unprecedented great leap forward has also emerged in all aspects of industrial and agricultural production, and brilliant achievements have been made, fundamentally changing the past impression that "Guangxi is backward."

　　The situation of the Great Leap Forward in Guangxi in 1958 is very exciting. In terms of grain, the total output reached 22.9 billion catties, doubling the output of 1957, achieving a yield of 800 catties per mu, and completing the ten-year target stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" in one year; in terms of water conservancy, from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, more than 120,000 large and small water conservancy projects were built in the region, increasing the irrigated area by 12 million mu; the total output of steel was more than 150,000 tons, equivalent to about 50 times the average annual output during the First Five-Year Plan period, ending the history of Guangxi not producing steel; the completed amount of investment in steel industry infrastructure was more than 34 times that of 1957; the completed amount of investment in the machinery industry was more than eight times that of 1957; the power generation was more than 175 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of seven times compared with the early days of liberation; more than 300 new highways were built in the region, with a total length of about 7,000 kilometers, more than five times the newly added mileage in 1957. In addition, more than 15,000 kilometers of cart roads have been built throughout the region.

　　Due to the great leap forward in production, the communization of the entire region has been realized, and people do not need to pay for food and also receive wages. The lives of the people of Guangxi have also been greatly improved. Judging from the above figures alone, the socialist construction of Guangxi in 1958, like other provinces and regions in the country, has also witnessed an unprecedented great leap forward. The Great Leap Forward in Guangxi is also a powerful proof of the national Great Leap Forward.

　　In the situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi fully demonstrated an unprecedented spirit of unity and cooperation, and stirred up soaring enthusiasm. Now let me cite two folk songs for everyone to see:

　　"The Yao and Zhuang ethnic groups are one family, everyone is a farmer; everything is for the Great Leap Forward, not afraid of high mountains and deep waters." "When the news of 'Double Rush' arrives in my village, every Yao family thinks carefully; support the Zhuang people to engage in production, unite to produce 10,000 catties of grain per mu."

　　In the mass iron smelting campaign last year, the mutual cooperation and support between counties also exerted tremendous power. At that time, the people's enthusiasm was so great that it could be seen in the following folk song: "To say that the biggest is the sky, our enthusiasm must soar to the sky; to say that the most capable is the god, our intelligence is better than the gods. Heroes of the past have become the past, the real heroes are seen today!"

　　The reason why Guangxi has achieved such great achievements is very obvious. First of all, it is due to the wise leadership of the Party, and the greatness and correctness of the Party's policies. Secondly, it is because the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, under the leadership of the Party, united and cooperated, and implemented the Party's guidelines and policies. We deeply realize that only by uniting under the leadership of the Party and taking the road of socialism can the people of the whole country have a prosperous and happy day, otherwise it is impossible.

　　Therefore, we express our utmost indignation at the armed rebellion launched by a handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet to betray the motherland and undermine the unity of the motherland. Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times. The Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Hui ethnic groups, as well as the Zhuang in Guangxi, and even the Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnic groups, are all one family. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a unified multi-ethnic country." "All ethnic autonomous regions are inseparable parts of the People's Republic of China." Therefore, when this rebellion broke out, the 1.2 million people of Tibet, except for a very small number of traitors, united unanimously, united around the Party, and assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. We believe that in the future, Tibetan compatriots will, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, rapidly develop production and embark on the road to prosperity and happiness together; and the new construction of Tibet will surely advance by leaps and bounds, just like the provinces (regions).

　　We resolutely support the Party's General Line, and we must work together with the people of the whole country, based on the victory of 1958, strive for the upper reaches of socialism with soaring enthusiasm, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!

　　Wish the conference a complete success!
　　Wish all committee members good health!

### 广西僮族自治区的大跃进  林虎、雷沛鸿、丘辰委员的联合发言

　　广西僮族自治区的大跃进
    林虎、雷沛鸿、丘辰委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们在全体委员会议上听了李维汉副主席所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告，以及列席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议听了周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，受到很大的鼓舞，感到无比的兴奋。我们一致表示衷心拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我国自从一九四九年解放以来，至今将满十周年。由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，全国人民的不懈努力，我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设已经取得了辉煌的胜利。特别是一九五八年在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国在工业、农业、交通、运输、文化、教育、卫生等各个方面都出现了史无前例的巨大跃进，取得了伟大的成就，大大地改变了我国“一穷二白”的面貌。这种欣欣向荣的气象显示了我国无限光明的前途，使我国人民感到兴奋！感到自豪！
    以广西僮族自治区的情况来说，我国一九五八年的大跃进是任何人都不能怀疑的。广西在总路线的光辉照耀下，由于党的英明领导，各族人民的团结协作，在工农业生产各个方面也出现了空前的大跃进，取得了辉煌的成绩，基本上改变了过去一般人所认为“广西落后”的面貌。
    一九五八年，广西各个方面的大跃进情况是令人十分兴奋的。以粮食来说，总产量达到二百二十九亿斤，比一九五七年的产量增加了一倍，实现了亩产八百斤，一年完成了“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”规定的十年完成的指标；在水利方面，自一九五七年冬到一九五八年春，全区共修建了大小水利工程十二万多处，增加灌溉面积达一千二百万亩；钢铁的总产量在十五万吨以上，相当于第一个五年计划期间平均年产量约五十倍左右，结束广西不产钢的历史；钢铁工业基建投资的完成额为一九五七年的三十四倍多；机械工业投资的完成额为一九五七年的八倍多；发电量为一亿七千五百多万度，比解放初期增加七倍；全区新建公路三百多条，总长度约七千公里，为一九五七年新增里程的五倍多。此外，全区各地还修建大车路一万五千多公里。
    由于生产大跃进，实现了全区公社化，吃饭不要钱还领工资，广西人民的生活也得到很大的改善。仅就上述几个数字看，一九五八年广西社会主义建设事业也和全国各省、区一样，出现了空前的大跃进。广西的大跃进也就是全国大跃进的一个有力的明证。
    在一九五八年的大跃进形势下，广西各族人民充分表现了空前的团结协作精神，鼓起了冲天的干劲。现在先举两首民歌给大家看看：
    “瑶僮民族一家亲，大家都是种田人；一切为了大跃进，不怕山高水又深。”“双抢消息到我乡，瑶家个个细思量；支援僮族搞生产，团结亩产万斤粮。”
    在去年全民炼铁运动中，各县互相协作支援，也发挥了巨大的力量。当时人民干劲之大，可于下列一首民歌中见到：“要说大来天最大，我们干劲要冲天；要说能来神最能，我们智能赛神仙。历代豪杰成过去，真正英雄看今天！”
    广西之所以取得这样伟大成就，非常明显，首先是由于党的英明领导，党的政策伟大和正确。其次是广西各族人民在党的领导下，团结协作，贯彻了党的方针政策。我们深深体会到，全国人民只有团结在党的领导下，走社会主义的道路，才有繁荣幸福的一日，否则是不可能的。
    因此，我们对于西藏一小撮上层反动分子所发动的背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一的武装叛乱表示无比的愤慨。西藏自古以来就是中国的领土，汉族、藏族、蒙古族、回族，同在广西的僮族以至苗族、瑶族、侗族等五十多个民族，都是一家亲。中华人民共和国宪法规定：“中华人民共和国是统一的多民族的国家。”“各民族自治地方都是中华人民共和国不可分离的部分。”所以当这个叛乱一爆发，西藏一百二十万人民，除却极少数叛徒外，都一致团结起来，团结在党的周围，协助人民解放军，平定叛乱。我们相信，今后西藏同胞，将同全国各族人民一道，迅速地发展生产，一齐走上繁荣、幸福的道路；而西藏的新建设，必定能够同各省（区）一样，飞跃地前进。
    我们坚决地拥护党的总路线，一定要同全国人民一起，在一九五八年的胜利基础上，共同努力，鼓足冲天的干劲，力争社会主义的上游，为一九五九年的更大、更好、更全面的跃进而奋斗！
    祝大会胜利成功！
    祝各位委员身体健康！
