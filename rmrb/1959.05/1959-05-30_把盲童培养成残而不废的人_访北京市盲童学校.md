    Cultivating Blind Children to be Disabled but Not Useless People
    —A Visit to the Beijing Blind Children's School
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Shikai
    Before visiting the blind children's school, I had this idea in my mind: "Adult blind people have difficulty moving around, so blind children must have even more difficulties!" However, when I stepped into the Beijing Blind Children's School, surrounded by green trees in the western suburbs, I saw a completely different scene: groups of children were happily exercising on the sports field; some children were running in neat little teams, while others were learning gymnastics; two naughty children quietly climbed onto the horizontal bars under the poplar trees, reaching out to pick leaves, holding the lush green leaves and shouting with laughter, "These leaves are so big!"
    At this moment, a school official who came to greet me, seeing my gaze, said with a smile: "Before you came to the blind children's school, you must have thought that all the children here would be using crutches! Our school's mission is to cultivate visually impaired children into people who are disabled but not useless. The first lesson for these children after enrollment is to learn how to live independently." In the principal's office, Principal Huang Xiuying pointed to the photos on the wall and said: Last year, our students participated in the National Youth Blind Athletics Meet in Wuhan and won first place in both the 60-meter sprint and the standing long jump. Recently, at the Haidian District sports meet, a blind child competed with ordinary children and won first place in the 100-meter race. Blind children are generally not allowed to move around at home for fear of falling and getting injured, so their physical fitness is relatively poor. The school pays special attention to physical activities to improve the children's physical fitness.
    The class bell rang, and the noisy campus immediately quieted down. The young female teacher Xu Hailiang went to teach the fifth-grade class B. Unlike ordinary elementary school teachers who bring chalk, she brought many small square, triangular, and rhomboid wooden boards and blocks into the classroom. When she taught the "Preliminary Knowledge of Geometry" section of the arithmetic class, covering mathematical concepts such as area and volume, she handed those small wooden boards and blocks to the students who were listening attentively. When these blind children felt the shape of the small wooden boards and blocks exactly matched the concepts the teacher was explaining, smiles appeared on everyone's faces. Xu Hailiang has been teaching blind children for two years and has carefully studied the characteristics of blind children who mainly receive knowledge through hearing and touch, improved teaching methods, and created many arithmetic models to strengthen visual teaching, helping blind children to understand the teaching content more deeply. The sixth-grade classroom was having a nature class. A male teacher, continuing from the previous lesson on the structure and function of winches and cranes, let the students go to the podium to touch the models of the winches and cranes. A chubby boy smoothly answered the teacher's questions. In other classrooms, blind children were skillfully using small hammer-shaped pens to punch various raised dot symbols of Braille on thick paper, carefully recording language, history, and other courses with the same content as ordinary elementary schools. A classroom was having a geography test, and the blind children were lying on their desks answering the teacher's oral questions in Braille, including questions about the terrain of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and why the Yellow River frequently flooded and breached its banks before liberation. Many teachers told me that these blind children rely on their sensitive hearing and touch to attend classes and read Braille, and their visual impairment does not affect their learning. Most of their grades in all subjects are excellent.
    These blind children's extracurricular activities are also very active. They write wall newspapers in Braille and also correspond with students from blind children's schools in Moscow, Uzbekistan, and other places in the Soviet Union, establishing deep friendships with each other. The Young Pioneers of the blind children have established a small printing factory, and more than twenty children voluntarily take turns practicing using raised-dot lead type to print Braille reading materials. In the process of working in this small factory, they expand their knowledge and also learn production techniques. Other children, under the guidance of teachers, open up a small farm in the open space on the campus to grow peanuts and vegetables. In the handicraft room, often after class, some children still weave straw baskets only by touching them with their hands. The styles are not only beautiful, but the patterns are also very unique.
    Although the idiom "Musicians are often blind" reveals the musical talent of blind people, it can only be fully developed in our era. In this blind children's school, moving music and singing can often be heard. Blind children practice playing musical instruments in the classroom and sing on the road. A group of blind children, accompanied by a teacher, practice singing "Sing the Red May" while touching the music scores written in Braille. Lyu Shaoyong, a fourth-grade student, loved to play the flute from a young age. He continued to study hard in school and learned dozens of tunes. He also organized a Chinese music group with his classmates, and the school specially purchased some national musical instruments for them. The radio station also recorded their performances of "Fengyang Flower Drum" and "Our Hometown" and introduced them to a wide audience. Liu Huansheng, a fifth-grade student, leads a choir of more than forty blind children. They not only learn to read music and practice themselves, but also compose songs and music. This school has a small theater troupe, which is composed of more than ten sixth-grade students. They performed the drama "Burning Zhao's Mansion" on the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement this year, and are now rushing to rehearse programs for the "June 1st" Children's Day performance.
    In the same place as this blind children's school, blind children suffered another unfortunate fate before liberation. At that time, a British missionary ran a "Blind Asylum" here, recruiting blind children under the guise of "charity," working and preaching. Many blind children suffered exploitation and persecution, working for long hours every day, eating coarse rice mixed with sand, and corn with worms, and often suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Some blind children were tortured to death. The People's Government took over this "Blind Asylum" and turned it into a blind children's school, expanding the school buildings, beautifying the campus, and adding teaching aids and sports and music equipment. Many new teachers are shouldering the educational work of blind children with full enthusiasm. After introducing the teaching and life of blind children, Principal Huang said meaningfully: "All the staff of our school have the confidence to cultivate these children into socialist builders who are disabled but not useless under the leadership of the Party.

### 把盲童培养成残而不废的人——访北京市盲童学校

    把盲童培养成残而不废的人
    ——访北京市盲童学校
    新华社记者　孙世恺
    在访问盲童学校以前，我思想上有这样一个概念：“成年的盲人行动都不方便，盲童会更困难吧！”可是，当我踏进北京西郊一片绿树环绕的盲童学校，看到的却是另一番景象：成群的孩子在体育场上欢天喜地的进行锻炼，有些孩子排成整齐的小队跑步，有些孩子学体操；两个淘气的孩子悄悄地爬上安在杨树下的肋木，探身去摘树叶，他们拿着翠绿的树叶笑着喊叫：“这树叶多大呀！”
    这时，迎面过来的一位学校负责同志，见到我凝眸注视的神态，笑着说：“你们来盲童学校以前一定会认为这里都是手扶拐棍的孩子吧！我们学校的任务就是要把双目失明的孩子培养成残而不废的人。这些孩子入学后的第一课就是学会如何独立生活。”在校长办公室，校长黄秀英指着墙上的照片说：我们的学生去年到武汉参加全国青年盲人田径运动会，曾获得六十公尺短跑和急行跳远两项第一。最近在海淀区的运动会上，有个盲童和普通孩子比赛又取得百公尺赛跑第一。盲童在家里怕跌倒摔伤一般不让活动，体质都较差，学校根据这种情况就格外注意体育活动，增强孩子的体质。
    上课铃响了，喧闹的校园立刻安静下来。年轻的女教师徐海亮到五年级乙班去上课。她不像普通小学的教员带几根粉笔，而是拿许多正方形、三角形和棱形的小木板、小木块走进教室。她讲到算术课“几何初步知识”一节的面积、体积等数学概念时，便把那些小木板和小木块交给聚精会神听课的学生。当这群盲童摸出小木板和小木块的形状正是老师所讲的概念时，每个人的脸上都浮现出笑容。徐海亮担任盲童教学两年，细心地研究盲童主要靠听觉和触觉接受知识的特点，改进教学，制造了许多算术模型加强直观教学，帮助盲童更深刻地理解教学内容。六年级教室正上自然课。有位男教师继上一堂讲过的绞车和起重机的构造及其作用，让学生到讲台旁摸绞车和起重机的模型，一个胖胖的男孩子顺利地回答着老师的提问。在另一些教室里，盲童都很熟练地用小铁锤形的笔在厚纸上扎出各种凸点符号的盲字，用心记录老师讲授和普通小学一样内容的语文、历史等课程。有个教室正在进行地理测验，盲童们伏在桌上用盲字解答教师口述的题目，其中有黄河中下游区的地形和解放前黄河为什么经常泛滥决口等问题。许多教师都告诉我说：这些盲童依靠灵敏的听觉和触觉上课，摸盲字读书，并没因为双目失明而影响学习，各门功课考试的成绩多数是优良。
    这些盲童的课余生活也十分活跃。他们用盲字写壁报，还和苏联莫斯科、乌兹别克等地盲童学校的学生通信，彼此建立起深厚的友谊。盲童的少先队建立一个小印刷厂，有二十多个孩子自愿轮流练习用凸点铅字排印盲文读物。他们在这个小工厂里的劳动过程中，扩大知识领域，也学到了生产技术。另外一些孩子则在校园内的空地上，由教师指导开辟一个小农场，种花生和蔬菜。在手工室里，往往在下课后，还有些孩子仅凭手的抚摸编织草篮，不仅样式美观，花纹也很别致。
    “瞽者善乐”这句成语虽然道出盲人富有音乐的天资，但是只有在我们这个时代才能得到充分的发挥。在这所盲童学校里，经常都可听到动人的乐声和歌声。盲童们在教室里练习弹奏，走在路上也歌唱。一群盲童在教员的伴奏下，手摸盲字写的乐谱练唱“歌唱红色的五月”。四年级学生吕绍永从幼小就爱吹笛子，在学校里继续勤学苦练，学会了几十支曲子。他还和同学们组织一个国乐组，学校特意为他们购置一些民族乐器，广播电台还将他们演奏的“凤阳花鼓”、“我们的家乡”等乐曲录音，介绍给广大的听众。五年级学生刘环生领导一个有四十多盲童参加的合唱团，他们不仅自己识谱练习，还动手编歌作曲。这个学校有个小剧团，是六年级的十多个学生组成的。他们在今年“五四”四十周年纪念日演出了话剧“火烧赵家楼”，现在又赶排“六一”儿童节的演出节目。
    就在这个盲童学校的地方，解放前的盲童却受到了另一种不幸的遭遇。那时，有个英国传教士在这里办了一个“瞽目院”，打着“慈善”的招牌招收一些盲童，一边劳动一边传教，许多盲童受尽了剥削和迫害，每天劳动的时间很长，吃的粗米里夹砂子，玉米里面长虫子，经常患肠胃病。有的盲童被折磨死，人民政府接管了这个“瞽目院”，改为盲童学校，扩建校舍，美化校园，增添教具和体育、音乐设备。许多新来的教师，都怀着满腔热情肩负起对盲童的教育工作。黄校长介绍了盲童的教学和生活后，意味深长地说：“我们学校所有的工作人员都有信心在党的领导下，把这些孩子培养成残而不废的社会主义建设者。
