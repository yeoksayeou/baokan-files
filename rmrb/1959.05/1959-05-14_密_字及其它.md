    The Character "Dense" and Other Matters

    The character "dense" is one of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." How dense is good? Answer: "Reasonable close planting."

    What is considered "reasonable"?

    "The sparser, the better" - historical experience has proven this to be unreasonable.

    "The denser, the better" - is this "reasonable"? It should be said that it is also not "reasonable." However, some people think so, and do so. In one mu of wheat field, a thousand jin of seeds were sown. When the wheat seedlings emerged, they were as thin as hair, and "lodged" during the seedling stage.

    "Density" to such an extent is almost absurd.

    Indeed, taking one step beyond the truth is utterly absurd. There are objective standards for what constitutes "reasonable."

    What is the objective standard for "reasonable close planting"?

    Zhao Ansheng, a labor model from the Guoguang Production Team of the Huancheng Commune in ZaoYang County, used facts to illustrate that too dense or too sparse cotton is not good. There are a few examples from their team: two mu of upland, with 5,500 plants per mu, yielded 500 jin of seed cotton per mu; an adjacent 1.5 mu of land, with 3,200 plants per mu, yielded 80 jin of seed cotton per mu (in addition to the yield reduction due to sparse planting, poor management was also a reason). There were also two mu of riverside land, with 8,300 plants per mu, with tall seedlings and few bolls, yielding 300 jin of seed cotton per mu; another plot of riverside land, with 4,500 plants per mu, yielded 700 jin of seed cotton per mu. The soil and fertilizer were roughly the same; the yields differed greatly solely because the density was comparatively "reasonable" versus comparatively "unreasonable."

    As mentioned above, the character "dense" has its objective standards. The other seven characters of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" also each have their objective standards. Each character of the "Eight-Point Charter" is a measure. Whether a certain measure is good or not is not up to anyone's whims; it depends on whether the result of implementing the measure is increased production. That's one aspect. Another important aspect is that even the best measure for increasing production will not achieve the goal of increasing production if cadres take over and issue mandatory orders. Only when the commune members personally experience the benefits of this production-increasing measure and are willing to work hard to realize it can the goal of increasing production be achieved. Therefore, we advocate that in the process of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter," we must boldly mobilize the masses, and everything must be tested.

    For some comrades, the most important thing is still to recognize the objective laws of the "Eight-Point Charter" and the objective laws of crop growth. The objective standards of the "Eight-Point Charter" are determined by the objective laws of crop growth. Since the growth of crops has its objective laws, whether you recognize them or not, they will always take effect. That is to say, if you recognize it, understand it, and grasp it, it can have a good effect, and the result is increased production. Conversely, if you do not recognize it, do not understand it, do not grasp it, or even violate it, the result is reduced production. Objective laws are scientific things, things that "do not consider feelings," and things that do not depend on people's subjective wishes. It will never make you avoid running into snags just because your subjective wish is "increased production" while you violate it. No, it's not like that. As long as you violate it -- this "objective law" -- it will unceremoniously make you break your head and bleed.

    Can objective laws be found? Is it like finding something in a pocket, finding it all at once? Objective laws are not mysterious and unpredictable; they can be found. However, it takes effort, it takes brains, it takes boldly mobilizing the masses, it takes experimentation, and it takes summarization. Wasn't the labor model mentioned above already found the objective standard for close planting of cotton? The cotton close planting standards for upland and riverside land that he mentioned were found only after putting in effort, using his brain, mobilizing the masses, experimenting, and summarizing. If the leaders of this team can apply the most fundamental thing from the experiences and lessons of cotton close planting in 1958 -- acting in accordance with objective laws -- to leading the entire team's production, then not only will the team's production achieve an all-round bumper harvest, but also the team's leadership level will be greatly improved.

    "Learn wisdom through experience." Seriously summarizing the experience of 1958 will greatly benefit the entire party, the entire people, and each individual. What is said here about "reasonable close planting" is only a drop in the ocean of experience.

### “密”字及其它

    “密”字及其它
    “密”字，是农业“八字宪法”之一字。密到什么程度才好？曰：“合理密植。”
    怎样才算“合理”？
    “越稀越好”，历史经验证明这是不合理的。
    “越密越好”，是不是“合理”？应当说，也不“合理”。可是，有一些人是这样想的，而且是这样做的。一亩麦子地，下了一千斤种子，麦苗出土，细得像头发一样，在苗期就“倒伏”了。
    “密”到这样的程度，就近乎荒谬了。
    的确是这样，超过真理一步，就荒谬绝伦。怎样才算“合理”是有它的客观标准的。
    什么是“合理密植”的客观标准？
    枣阳县环城公社国光生产队劳动模范赵安生，用事实说明了棉花过密或者过稀都不好。他们队里有这样几个例子：二亩岗地，每亩五千五百株，单产籽棉五百斤；紧挨着的一亩五分地，每亩三千二百株，单产籽棉八十斤（除了因为稀植减产以外，管理不好也是一个原因）。还有二亩河地，每亩八千三百株，苗高桃少，单产籽棉三百斤；另一块河地，每亩四千五百株，单产籽棉七百斤。土质、肥料大体相同，就是因为密度比较“合理”和比较“不合理”，产量相差很大。
    如上所说，“密”字有它的客观标准，农业“八字宪法”的其他七个字，也都各有它的客观标准。“八字宪法”的每一个字，都是一项措施。到底某项措施好不好，不是任何人想怎么样就怎么样，而是要看实行这项措施的结果是不是增产，这是一个方面；还有一个重要方面，即使是最好的增产措施，如果是干部包办代替，强迫命令，一定达不到增产的目的。只有社员群众亲身体验了这项增产措施的好处，并且愿为实现它而努力，才能达到增产的目的。因此我们主张，在执行“八字宪法”的过程中，要放手发动群众，一切经过试验。
    对于某些同志来说，最重要的还是应当承认“八字宪法”的客观规律，承认农作物生长的客观规律。“八字宪法”的客观标准，是农作物生长的客观规律所决定的。既然农作物的生长有它的客观规律，不管你承认也好，不承认也好，它总是要发生作用的。这就是说，你承认它，认识它，掌握它，它就能发生好的作用，其结果，就是增加生产；反之，如果你不承认它，不认识它，不掌握它，甚至违犯它，其结果，就是减少生产。客观规律是科学的东西，是“不顾情面”的东西，是不以人的主观愿望为转移的东西。它决不因为你的主观愿望是“增产”，而当你违背它的时候，也不使你碰钉子。不，不是的。只要你违背了它——这位“客观规律”，它就毫不客气地叫你碰的头破血流。
    能不能找到客观规律呢？是不是像在口袋里找东西一样一下子就找到了它呢？客观规律并不是神机莫测的，是能够找到的；但是，要花工夫，要动脑筋，要放手发动群众，要做试验，要做总结。上面说的那位劳动模范不是已经找到了棉花密植的客观标准了吗？他所说的岗地和河地的棉花密植的标准，就是花了工夫，动了脑筋，发动了群众，做了试验，做了总结才找到的。如果这个队的领导上，能够把1958年棉花密植方面的经验教训中最根本的东西，——照客观规律办事这一条，运用到领导全队生产上，那么，不仅这个队的生产要获得全面丰收，而且这个队的领导水平将要大大地提高一步。
    “经一事，长一智”。认真地总结1958年的经验，对全党全民和每一个人本身都会得到很大的好处。这里说的“合理密植”，不过是经验大海当中的点滴而已。
