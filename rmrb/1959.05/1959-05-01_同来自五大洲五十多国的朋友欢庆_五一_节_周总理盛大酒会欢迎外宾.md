Xinhua News Agency, April 30th Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a grand reception this evening, gathering with foreign guests from over fifty countries to celebrate the international workers' holiday—"May Day." In his speech at the reception, he solemnly declared that the Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of oppressed and invaded countries and peoples, and fully support the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Premier Zhou Enlai also stated that the Chinese people will continue to work with the people of all countries in the world to jointly safeguard world peace and promote friendly cooperation among nations.

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was met with thunderous and prolonged applause from over 1,400 Chinese and foreign attendees.

Present at this grand reception were over seven hundred foreign guests from five continents and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China. As the guests arrived, Premier Zhou Enlai, along with Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Tan Zhenlin, Luo Ruiqing, and Xi Zhongxun, greeted the distinguished guests at the entrance, shaking hands with each one.

The banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was filled with festive joy this evening. Although the people came from different countries, with different skin colors, occupations, and religious beliefs, and spoke different languages, they expressed a common desire in their cordial conversations—to jointly struggle for the defense of world peace.

At 6:15 PM, the grand reception began. Premier Zhou Enlai spoke amidst a storm of applause. He said:

Respected distinguished guests,

The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Münnich Ferenc,

The People's Chamber Delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Comrade Johannes Dieckmann and Comrade Hermann Matern,

The Polish United Workers' Party Delegation headed by Comrade Jerzy Morawski,

The Albanian Labor Party Delegation headed by Comrade Hysni Kapo,

The Indonesian Communist Party Delegation headed by Comrade Lukman,

The Italian Communist Party Delegation headed by Comrade Antonio Roasio,

The Australian Communist Party Delegation headed by Comrade Sam Aarons,

The Algerian Military Delegation headed by Secretary of State Omar Ouamrane,

Dear Comrades and Friends:

On the eve of the 1959 "May Day" International Labor Day, we are very pleased to gather with over seven hundred respected foreign guests from more than fifty countries to celebrate this holiday of the working people of the world. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to you.

In the past year, under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, our people have achieved a tremendous and comprehensive leap forward in the national economy and a great victory in the people's commune movement through their own creative labor. However, the tasks facing the Chinese people are still very arduous, because measured by the standards of an advanced industrial country, our production level and living standards are clearly still very low; our country still faces external aggression and interference. In order to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country, and in order to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland, the Chinese people still need to make long-term efforts and unyielding struggles. In the cause of building socialism and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese people have consistently received strong support from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and the sympathy and support of all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the friends from all countries, and please convey to the people of your respective countries this deep gratitude and friendship of the Chinese people.

The peace-loving Chinese people are pleased to see that the international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the forces of peace and progress, and unfavorable to the forces of war and reaction. The imperialist bloc is increasingly heading towards disintegration, and their days are getting harder and harder. Under the pressure of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the United States, Britain, and France have now had to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference and a summit conference. We fully support the Soviet Union's proposal and hope that the convening of these conferences can help resolve the issues of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, ending the occupation system in West Berlin, and other mature international issues, thereby contributing to the elimination of threats to European security and the easing of international tensions.

However, the people of all countries striving for peace cannot but maintain a high degree of vigilance against the new aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. In addition to stubbornly adhering to the policies of arms expansion, war preparation, and the Cold War, U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to undermine the unity of anti-imperialist forces, especially the unity of socialist countries and nationalist countries.

It attempts to use this method to isolate nationalist countries, deprive them of the support of socialist countries, so that it can arbitrarily manipulate and control these countries. However, the increasingly awakened peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will not fall into its trap. On the contrary, the more U.S. imperialism tries to undermine our unity, the more we must consolidate this unity. The Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of oppressed and invaded countries and peoples, and fully support the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In the past year, U.S. imperialism has carried out blatant interference and subversive activities against Indonesia and Cambodia, especially recently against Iraq and Cuba. The Chinese people have consistently strived to support the struggle of the Indonesian people and the Cambodian people against foreign interference and to safeguard national sovereignty through friendly cooperation in various fields. In recent times, the Chinese people have also strengthened and developed friendly relations with the Iraqi people. We are willing to establish and develop economic and cultural ties with the Cuban people in the same way. The Chinese people will continue to work with the people of all countries in the world to jointly safeguard world peace and promote friendly cooperation among nations.

Let us:

For peaceful labor,

For world peace and the friendship and solidarity of the people of all countries,

For the health of the friends from all countries attending this reception,

Cheers!

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech aroused wave after wave of sustained and thunderous applause in the hall. At the end of his speech, all the guests and hosts stood up and drank a toast to peace and friendship.

Tonight, Vice Chairmen Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyi Gyaltsen, Lin Feng, President Xie Juezai, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC Burhan and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, as well as responsible persons of various departments of state organs and well-known figures from all walks of life, attended the reception. They drank and chatted with the guests from various countries.

Amidst bursts of warm applause, and in a hall filled with peaceful and friendly conversations, Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass and walked to the seats of the distinguished guests from five continents, warmly toasting the distinguished guests and congratulating them on the holiday. When Premier Zhou Enlai toasted the distinguished guests from the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, he thanked them for their sincere help in our country's construction. He expressed to the distinguished guests from Asia, Africa, and Latin America the Chinese people's sympathy and support for their anti-colonialist struggles, and wished them new victories. Wherever Premier Zhou Enlai went, it became the center of joy.

At 7:50 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai announced the end of the reception and once again raised his glass to wish all the guests good health and good night. At this time, the hosts and guests once again stood up, and the thunderous applause reverberated through the banquet hall for a long time.

    同来自五大洲五十多国的朋友欢庆“五一”节
    周总理盛大酒会欢迎外宾
    他在宴会上庄严宣告：中国人民坚决地站在被压迫、被侵略的国家和人民一边，全力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动；中国人民将继续同世界各国人民一起，为维护世界和平和促进各国友好合作做出共同的努力。
    新华社30日讯　周恩来总理今天晚间举行盛大酒会，同来自五十多个国家的外宾欢聚一堂，共庆世界劳动人民的节日——“五一”节。他在酒会上讲话中庄严地宣告：中国人民坚决地站在被压迫、被侵略的国家和人民一边，全力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动。
    周恩来总理还说：中国人民将继续同世界各国人民一起，为维护世界和平和促进各国友好合作做出共同的努力。
    周恩来总理的讲话，博得了一千四百多位中外人士经久不息的热烈掌声。
    出席这个盛大酒会的，有来自世界五大洲的七百多位外宾和各国驻中国的使节。当各国来宾们到达的时候，周恩来总理和陈云、邓小平、贺龙、陈毅、乌兰夫、李富春、李先念、聂荣臻、薄一波、谭震林、罗瑞卿、习仲勋副总理等在门口迎接贵宾，同他们一一握手。
    北京饭店的宴会大厅今晚一片节日的欢乐。人们虽然来自不同的国度，有着不同的肤色、职业和宗教信仰，说着不同的语言，但是，人们在亲切的交谈中，却表达了一个共同的意愿——为保卫世界和平而共同斗争。　六时十五分，盛大的酒会开始。周恩来总理在暴风雨般的掌声中讲话。他说：尊敬的各国贵宾们，
    以明尼赫·费伦茨同志为首的匈牙利党政代表团，
    以约翰尼斯·狄克曼同志和赫尔曼·马特恩同志为首的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团，
    以耶日·莫拉夫斯基同志为首的波兰统一工人党代表团，
    以希斯尼·卡博同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团，
    以鲁克曼同志为首的印度尼西亚共产党代表团，
    以安东尼奥·罗西欧同志为首的意大利共产党代表团，
    以萨姆·阿伦斯同志为首的澳大利亚共产党代表团，
    以奥马尔·乌西迪克国务秘书为首的阿尔及利亚军事代表团，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    在1959年“五一”国际劳动节的前夕，我们能够同来自五十多个国家的七百多位尊敬的外宾欢聚一堂，庆祝这个世界劳动人民的节日，感到十分高兴。我代表中国政府和中国人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    过去一年中，在中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，我国人民用自己创造性的劳动，取得了国民经济的巨大的全面的跃进和人民公社化运动的伟大胜利。但是，摆在中国人民面前的任务还是十分艰巨的，因为拿一个先进工业国的标准来衡量，我国的生产水平和生活水平显然还是很低的；我国至今还面临着外来的侵略和干涉。为了把我国建设成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义国家，为了实现祖国的完全统一，中国人民还需要进行长期的努力和不屈不挠的斗争。中国人民在建设社会主义和维护国家主权和领土完整的事业中，一贯地得到苏联和其他社会主义国家的大力支援，得到世界上一切爱好和平和维护正义的人民的同情和支持。我愿借此机会向各国的朋友们表示衷心的感谢，并且请你们把中国人民这种深切的谢意和友谊带给你们本国的人民。
    热爱和平的中国人民高兴地看到，国际形势空前有利于和平力量和进步力量，而不利于战争力量和反动力量。帝国主义集团日益走向四分五裂，他们的日子越来越不好过。在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的压力下，现在美、英、法三国已经不得不接受苏联关于召开外长会议和政府首脑会议的建议。我们全力支持苏联的建议，并且希望这些会议的召开能够有助于解决缔结对德和约、结束西柏林占领制度以及其他一些成熟了的国际问题，从而对消除欧洲安全的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势做出贡献。
    但是，争取和平的各国人民不能不对美帝国主义新的侵略阴谋保持高度的警惕。美帝国主义除了顽固地坚持扩军备战和冷战政策以外，正在千方百计地破坏反帝力量的团结、特别是社会主义国家同民族主义国家的团结。
    它妄图用这种办法，孤立民族主义国家，使它们失去社会主义国家的支持，以便自己任意摆布和控制这些国家。但是，日益觉醒的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民是不会上它的圈套的。相反的，美帝国主义愈是要破坏我们之间的团结，我们就愈是要巩固这种团结。中国人民坚决地站在被压迫、被侵略的国家和人民一边，全力支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动。一年来，美帝国主义对印度尼西亚和柬埔寨，特别是最近对伊拉克和古巴，进行露骨的干涉和颠覆活动。中国人民一贯通过各方面的友好合作，尽力支持印度尼西亚人民和柬埔寨人民反对外来干涉和维护国家主权的斗争。最近一个时期以来，中国人民也加强和发展了同伊拉克人民的友好关系。我们愿意同样地同古巴人民建立和发展经济上和文化上的联系。中国人民将继续同世界各国人民一起，为维护世界和平和促进各国友好合作做出共同的努力。
    让我们：
    为和平的劳动，
    为世界和平和各国人民的友谊和团结，
    为参加这个招待会的各国朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
    周恩来总理的讲话引起了会场上一阵又一阵持久不息的雷动掌声。在他讲话结束的时候，宾主全体起立，为和平和友谊干了一杯酒。
    今晚，林伯渠、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫副委员长，谢觉哉院长，张鼎丞检察长，政协全国委员会包尔汉、阿沛·阿旺晋美副主席，以及国家机关各部门的负责人和各方面的著名人士，都出席了酒会，他们分别同各国来宾们一起饮酒交谈。
    在一阵阵热烈的掌声中，在满堂和平和友谊的谈笑声中，周恩来总理举杯走到来自五大洲的贵宾们的席位前面，热情地同贵宾们碰杯，祝贺节日。周恩来总理在向苏联和各兄弟国家的贵宾们祝酒时，感谢他们对我国建设的热诚帮助。他向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的贵宾们表达了中国人民对他们的反殖民主义斗争的同情和支持，并且祝他们取得新的胜利。周恩来总理走到那里，那里就成为欢乐的中心。
    七时五十分，周恩来总理宣布酒会结束，并再一次举杯祝全体来宾的身体健康和晚安。这时候，宾主又一次全体起立，春雷般的掌声长时间地震荡着宴会大厅。
