Hydrology—Eyes and Ears of Water Conservancy Construction and Agricultural Production
Ye Yongyi, Deputy Director of the Hydrology Research Institute of the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute

Water and people have a close relationship. Without water, people cannot live and produce; too much water will bring disasters to people's lives and property. How to control water and keep it at a proper amount is a desire that people have held since ancient times.

To Control Water, First Understand Water

In order to utilize and control water, we must first understand it. For example, how many millimeters of rainfall there are, how much flow there is in the river (i.e., how many cubic meters of water flow per second), how many meters high the flood level will rise, how much sediment and mineral salts the water contains, and so on. In addition to understanding the water in the sky (rain, snow, dew, hail) and surface water (rivers, lakes, swamps), we must also understand groundwater and glacier water.

Understanding the different characteristics of various water bodies and using their laws of change to serve people's lives and production is the research content of hydrology.

In combat, we send out sentries to scout and monitor the enemy. In the struggle against water, various types of hydrological stations are our sentries for scouting and monitoring water conditions. Since the founding of the country, under the care of the Party, hydrological work has developed by leaps and bounds. By the end of 1958, there were 5,257 rain gauge stations set up by the state in various places, as well as 1,233 water level stations and 2,746 flow stations set up on large and small rivers and lakes. There are nearly 20,000 hydrological workers in these stations. They brave wind, frost, rain and dew all year round, and observe the local rainfall, evaporation and water level in the river every day. Whether in the cold winter or the turbulent flood season, they have to go to the river to measure the river's water depth, flow velocity, flow rate and sediment content.

Recording these measurement results becomes "hydrological records." The "hydrological records" of each year are systematically sorted out and then published as "hydrological yearbooks." In these, we can see the values of water level, flow, sediment content, rainfall, and evaporation for each day of the 365 days of the year. After several years, the data of past years are statistically analyzed and printed into "hydrological statistics," so that people can quickly find the average annual water volume, maximum water volume, and minimum water volume of each river. The same is true for other items such as rainstorms, floods, and sediment. With these records, yearbooks, and statistics, it is like having a person's historical file, and we can conduct detailed understanding and comprehensive analysis of the river's characteristics.

When we build a reservoir on a river, we need to calculate the maximum flood that may occur within the service life of the building, so as to determine the size of the reservoir and avoid danger. The construction of bridges and culverts for railways and highways also requires this design data. For hydropower stations or irrigation projects, in addition to floods, we must also estimate possible dry water conditions, so as not to fail to guarantee water or electricity supply at that time. When building a reservoir on a sandy river, it is necessary to calculate the amount of sediment deposited in the reservoir; when designing the water supply project of a factory, it is necessary to estimate the water quality at various periods; and so on, all of which are inseparable from hydrological calculations.

In order to carry out these hydrological calculations, we must first statistically analyze the data observed in previous years, and apply mathematical methods to estimate the values of various frequencies that may occur in the future. For example, for important projects like the Guanting Reservoir, a relatively rare once-in-a-millennium flood should be used for design; for small-scale projects, a lower once-in-a-century or once-in-fifty-year flood can be used as the design standard.

Since the observation period of most rivers in our country is not very long, in order to make the calculation results more reliable, on-site investigation is needed to understand the historical situation. For example, when designing the Sanmenxia Reservoir, we learned from the residents along the Yellow River in Shan County the legend of "In the 23rd year of Daoguang, the Yellow River rose to the sky, washed away the Taiyangdu ferry, and took away Wanjintan" (Taiyangdu and Wanjintan are place names along the Yellow River near Shan County). The elderly pointed out the flood traces they had heard of that year, and calculated the flood flow in 1843 AD. China's rich historical records are also of great use to us. For example, regarding the flood in the 23rd year of Daoguang, the book "Zai Xu Xing Shui Jin Jian" recorded the memorial of the river minister that year, "...According to the report from Shanzhou, from Chenshi on the 14th to Yinshi on the 15th, the water rose again by one zhang, three chi, and three cun. The previous water had not yet receded, and the subsequent water followed. It is estimated that in one day and ten hours, the water rose by more than two zhang and eight cun. The waves were like overturning mountains, and there was no such rapid rise in the past cases." There are also many materials recording the rainfall and water conditions in various places in the archives of the Qing Palace. These materials are currently being sorted out.

Since the Great Leap Forward, water conservancy construction has been advancing by leaps and bounds, and a county has to build hundreds of reservoirs. Railways and highways are also being built more and faster, and there are usually 3,000 culverts for every 1,000 kilometers of lines. Facing these thousands upon thousands of reservoirs and culverts, how can we carry out detailed hydrological calculations one by one? The compilation of the hydrological calculation manual creatively solved this difficulty. People can find out how many tens of thousands of cubic meters of water are produced on average per year per square kilometer in any location by looking up the charts in these manuals. The hydrological design data such as rainstorms, floods, and sediment are also readily available. In this way, we can calculate the size of a culvert in two or three minutes and determine the storage capacity of a reservoir in half an hour. These manuals are now being compiled in many provinces, prefectures, and counties. It has become a powerful tool for water conservancy construction.

Hydrological Forecast is the Eye of Flood Control and Drought Resistance

During the great flood of the Yangtze River in 1954 and the great flood of the Songhua River in 1956, Hankou and Harbin were severely threatened. The whole country was concerned about the safety of these cities and the vast countryside along the river. The leading comrades in charge of flood control most urgently needed to foresee the changes in water conditions: Would the flood continue to rise? How high would it rise? At this time, hydrological workers were working day and night to receive and translate flood situation telegrams from flood reporting stations across the country. Based on the water level and flow of the upstream station on that day, they predicted the height of the flood level at various locations along the river at various times tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and even the day after the day after tomorrow. This enabled the leading comrades to make timely decisions to take necessary measures, allocate manpower and materials, and overcome the fierce flood.

In order to extend the forecast period, it is also necessary to forecast floods from rainstorm forecasts.

Last year, a total of 290 rivers with a total length of 35,300 kilometers in various places carried out flood forecasts.

For small rivers where there are not yet conditions for flood forecasting, flood information and warning work also play a great role. For example, in Fuping County, Hebei Province, in the past, when the Shahe River rose, some people and livestock were washed away every year due to the wide river and the fierce water. Last year, with the flood warning system here, as soon as they heard the news of the upstream water rising, they immediately sent people to guard the ferry and drove cattle and sheep down the mountain, ensuring that no one or animal was injured or killed. Another example is the Baoan Commune in Yexian County, Henan Province. In July last year, there was a rainfall of 250 millimeters. After the hydrological station reported to the Party Committee, it immediately mobilized forces to strengthen the reservoir flood control. As soon as the personnel arrived, the water had already reached the top of the dam. Fortunately, they were rescued in time, and there was no danger.

Winter ice prevention on the Yellow River requires forecasting of ice floods; navigation on the Songhua River also requires knowing the date of river opening and freezing. The scheduling of irrigation reservoirs and the operation of hydropower stations all require knowing the amount of dry water.

These hydrological forecasting works are being carried out on many rivers in our country. In recent years, hydrological forecasting has played a great role in flood control and drought resistance, and has become the eye of the command organs.

Agricultural Hydrology Ensures Agricultural Harvests

The word "water" in the Eight-Character Constitution has two meanings: one is to eliminate floods and waterlogging disasters, and the other is to ensure timely and appropriate irrigation and drainage to maintain favorable soil moisture. For the former, hydrological calculations are needed to design reservoirs, and flood forecasts are needed to prepare for flood control as early as possible. For the latter, it is necessary to observe soil moisture (soil moisture content), control the amount of water in canals, and master the changes in groundwater level to carry out reasonable irrigation and drainage. The knowledge of studying these later problems can be called agricultural hydrology.

In recent years, the masses themselves have made many creations in this regard. For example, in Yexian County, Henan Province, which was mentioned earlier, in 1957, each commune set up soil moisture inspectors, who regularly observed soil moisture and used it to guide irrigation; which piece of land should be watered first, and which piece of land should be watered later. The masses are very satisfied with this. In 1958, Xinjiang Province put forward the slogan of scientific management of irrigation areas, installed water measuring weirs on many canals, and controlled the water allocation according to the cultivated land area and crop types. This avoided the past problems of uneven water allocation, where some were flooded and some were drought-stricken; it also saved water. For example, in the Xiaomogou irrigation area, 49,000 mu of land were irrigated in 1957, and 63,000 mu of land were irrigated in 1958. Another example is the Yulin Commune in Xuchang County, Henan Province. During the flood season, peasant observers reported to the higher authorities the situation of rising groundwater levels and excessive soil moisture content. The township Party Committee immediately decided to dig ditches for drainage, ensuring a bumper harvest of tobacco leaves.

When using urban sewage, industrial wastewater, and return water from irrigation areas for irrigation, pay attention to the chemical composition of the water to avoid killing crops. For rice irrigation, it is necessary to master the water temperature in order to achieve high yields.

In addition, the water and fertilizer retention effects of agricultural technical improvement measures such as deep plowing of land and horizontal tillage, the water storage and sediment interception effects of various soil and water conservation measures, and the yield-increasing effects of various irrigation systems can all be studied through experiments.

Although these agricultural hydrological works are currently only being carried out in a few areas, it is believed that with the advancement of the rural technical revolution and cultural revolution, they will be widely carried out and become an indispensable measure for agricultural bumper harvests.

Mass-Run Hydrology Has Many Advantages

It can be seen from the above that the planning, design, management and use of thousands upon thousands of mass-run water conservancy projects, and the lives and production of people in vast areas, all require hydrological observation as eyes and ears. Although the number of hydrological station networks established by the state is not small, it is still limited compared with the needs of vast areas, and it is impossible to serve all areas thoughtfully. Therefore, taking two legs to walk, that is, in addition to the state's investment in running hydrological station networks as the backbone, it is a good way to build some small and simple hydrological station networks by the masses themselves to serve the local area, in order to meet the needs of all aspects in a more, faster, better and more economical way and in a comprehensive way. Article 22 of the Central Government's Agricultural Development Program stipulates that "within twelve years, a network of meteorological stations and hydrological stations will be basically built...in order to prevent natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and freezing." At the Shahe River management work symposium in the winter of 1957, Secretary Tan Zhenlin also hoped that all agricultural cooperatives would have simple rainfall equipment, with special personnel responsible for recording rainfall and observing water conservancy projects.

Last year, many provinces have set up mass hydrological stations. Many counties have also set up dozens of rain gauge stations, some groundwater level stations, and soil moisture content measuring points. These mass-run hydrological stations, with the technical assistance of the state station network, have equipped some simple observation tools by using local materials and adapting to local conditions, and have achieved the goal of using the measurements as they are taken to serve the current production of the local area, and are therefore highly valued by the Party and government leaders in various places.

At present, mass hydrological work has not been well developed in some areas, and those that have been developed need to be further consolidated and improved. To promote mass hydrological work, it is first necessary to break through the ideological barrier and make leaders and the masses realize the role of hydrological work. And eliminate the superstitious idea that "hydrological work is a matter for technicians and experts, and farmers cannot do it, it costs money and delays work." Secondly, it is necessary to pass the technical barrier. The national hydrological station network should play a backbone role and help the masses technically. The third is the service barrier, and it is necessary to achieve measurement for use, use as it is measured, and see results at that time. In this way, the leaders will attach importance to it, the masses will be satisfied, and the work will be easily consolidated.

More than 2,000 years ago, the hardworking and brave people of our country engraved stones as rulers on the Baopingkou (place name) of Dujiangyan in Sichuan to observe the height of the water level and use it to control the diversion situation. In the Ming and Qing dynasties three or four hundred years ago, there was already a flood reporting system in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. When the water rose, the imperial horse was used to report, and it could also run in front of the flood. We believe that in the new China, the hardworking farmers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have much higher technical equipment and scientific knowledge than they did hundreds of years ago, and they will surely be able to run hydrological work in a big way.

    水文科学——水利建设和农业生产的耳目
    水利科学研究院水文研究所副所长　叶永毅
    水和人有着密切的关系。缺少水人们无法生活和生产；太多了又会给人们的生命财产带来灾害。怎样控制水，使它保持一个恰好数量，是人们自古以来就抱有的愿望。
    要想控制水，先要了解水
    为了利用和控制水，我们先要了解水。例如降雨量有多少公厘，河里有多少流量即每秒钟流过多少公方的水，洪水的水位会涨几公尺高，水里所含的泥沙和矿物盐分有多少，等等。除了了解天上水（雨、雪、露、雹）和地面水（江、河、湖、沼）以外，还要了解地下水和冰川水。
    了解各种水体的不同性格，利用它们的变化规律，来为人民的生活和生产服务，便是水文科学的研究内容。
    在作战的时候，我们要派出哨兵去侦察和监视敌人。在同水作斗争的时候，各种类型的水文测站，便是我们侦察和监视水情的哨兵。建国以来，在党的关怀下，水文工作有着飞跃的发展。到1958年底，由国家投资设在各地的雨量站有五千二百五十七个，设在大小河流和湖泊上的，还有一千二百三十三个水位站和二千七百四十六个流量站。在这些站上，有着将近二万个水文工作者。他们经年累月冒着风霜雨露，天天观测当地的雨量、蒸发量和河里的水位。不管在天寒地冻的严冬还是波涛汹涌的汛期，他们都要到河里测量河流的水深、流速、流量和含沙量。
    把这些测量的结果记载下来，便成为“水文记录”。各年的“水文记录”，要加以系统的整理，然后刊印成“水文年鉴”。在这里面我们可以看到一年三百六十五天，各天的水位、流量、含沙量、雨量和蒸发量等数值。经过了若干年，又把历年的资料加以统计，印成“水文统计”，使人们很快的便可查出各条河流的历年平均水量、最大水量和最小水量。对暴雨、洪水、泥沙等其他项目，也是如此。有了这些记录、年鉴和统计，就好比有了一个人的历史档案似的，对于河流的性格，我们便可以进行详细的了解和全面的分析了。
    当我们在河流上修建一座水库时，便需要算出在建筑物使用年限内，所可能碰到的最大洪水，从而确定水库的大小，以避免发生危险。修建铁路和公路的桥涵，也需要这种设计资料。对于水电站或灌溉工程，除了洪水之外，我们还要估计到可能的枯水情况，以免在那时不能保证供水或供电。在多沙河流上修建水库时，要计算水库的泥沙淤积量；在设计工厂的给水工程时，要估计各个时期的水质；如此等等，都离不开水文计算。
    为了进行这些水文计算，我们先要统计过去各年观测的资料，并应用数学的方法，推算在未来岁月中所可能发生的各种频率的数值。例如对像官厅水库这样重要的工程，要采用较罕见的千年一遇的洪水进行设计；而对于小型工程，则可采用较低的百年一遇或五十年一遇的洪水，作为设计标准。
    由于我国大多数河流，观测的年限都不太长，为了使计算成果较为可靠，需要进行实地调查，以了解历史上发生过的情况。例如，在设计三门峡水库时，就从陕县黄河沿岸的居民中，了解到“道光二十三，黄河涨上天，冲走太阳渡，捎带万锦滩”（太阳渡、万锦滩均为陕县附近黄河沿岸地名）的传说。并由老年人指出了他们所听说的当年洪水痕迹，并从而测算出公元1843年的洪水流量。中国的丰富史籍，对我们也有很大的用处。例如对道光二十三年的洪水，“再续行水金鉴”一书中便记载着当年河臣的奏折，“……据陕州呈报，十四日辰时至十五日寅刻，复涨水一丈三尺三寸，前水尚未见消而后水踵至。计一日十时之间，涨水至二丈八寸之多，浪若排山，历考成案未有涨水如此猛骤”。清故宫档案中，还有不少记载各地雨情水情的材料。这些材料，现在正在清理中。
    大跃进以来，水利建设突飞猛进，一个县就要修建成百个的水库。铁路和公路也修得又多又快，而每一千公里的线路，通常就有三千个涵洞。对着这些千千万万的水库和涵洞，我们怎能一一地进行详细的水文计算呢？水文计算手册的编制，便创造性地解决了这个困难。人们一查这些手册中的图表，便可知道任何一个地点在每平方公里面积上，每年平均产水多少万方。那里的暴雨、洪水、泥沙等等水文设计数据，也都一查便得。这样，我们便可以在二三分钟中算出一个涵洞的大小，半小时内可以决定一个水库的库容。这些手册，现在很多省和专、县都在着手编制。它已成为水利建设的一个有力工具。
    水文预报是防汛抗旱的眼睛
    当1954年长江大水和1956年松花江大水时，汉口和哈尔滨都受到严重的威胁。全国都关心着这些城市和沿江广大乡村的安全。负责防汛的领导同志们，最迫切需要的是预见水情的变化：洪水是否继续上涨？还会涨多高？这时水文工作者们，便昼夜不息地收译从各地报汛站拍来的汛情电报。他们根据上游站当天的水位和流量，预报出明天、后天甚至大后天各个时刻沿河各地洪水位的高低。使领导同志能够及时决定采取必要措施，调拨人力器材，战胜凶猛的洪水。
    为了增长预见期，还要从暴雨预报洪水。
    去年各地共有二百九十条河流，总长为三万五千三百公里的河段进行了洪水预报。
    对于还没有条件进行洪水预报工作的小河流，洪水情报和警报工作，也有很大的作用。例如，河北省的阜平县，过去沙河涨水，由于河宽水猛，年年都要冲走一些人和牲口。去年这里有了洪水警报制度，一听到上游涨水的消息，立即派人把住渡口，并赶牛羊下山，做到没有一人一畜伤亡。又如河南叶县保安公社，去年7月一次降雨二百五十公厘，水文站向党委汇报后，马上调动力量加强水库防汛。人员刚到，水已没到坝顶，幸亏及时抢救，没有出险。
    黄河冬天的防凌，需要凌汛的预报；松花江的航行，也要预知开河和封冻的日期。灌溉水库的调度，水电站的运转，都要预知枯水的来量。
    这些水文预报工作，都在我国的许多河流上进行着。几年来，水文预报对防汛抗旱起了很大的作用，成为指挥机关的眼睛。
    农业水文保证农业丰收
    八字宪法中的“水”字有两方面的意义，一是免除洪涝灾害，二是保证适时适量的灌溉排水，保持有利的土壤水分。为了前者，需要进行水文计算来设计水库，进行洪水预报以便及早准备防洪。为了后者，需要观测土壤的水分（墒情），控制渠道的水量，掌握地下水位的变化，来进行合理的排灌。研究后面这些问题的学问，可以称为农业水文。
    几年来群众自己在这方面，有了很多创造。例如，前面说过的河南省叶县，在1957年时就在各社设了查墒员，经常观测土壤水分，并据以指导灌溉；哪块地先浇，哪块地后浇。群众对此很满意。新疆省于1958年提出灌区管理科学化的口号，在许多渠道上安了量水堰，根据耕地面积和作物种类，掌握配水量。避免了过去配水不匀，有的受淹，有的受旱的毛病；也节省了水量。例如小磨沟灌区，1957年浇地四万九千亩，1958年浇了六万三千亩。又如河南省许昌县榆林社，农民观测员在汛期将地下水位升高、土壤含水量过大的情况，向上级汇报，乡党委当即决定挖沟排水，保证了烟叶丰收。
    在利用城市污水，工业废水和灌区回归水进行灌溉时，要注意水的化学成分，以免浇死庄稼。对水稻的灌溉，需要掌握水的温度，以求丰产。
    此外对深翻土地、横耕垅作等农业技术改良措施的保水保肥作用，各种水土保持措施的蓄水拦泥作用，各种灌溉制度的增产作用等，都可以通过试验，进行研究。
    这些农业水文工作，目前虽然还只在不多的地区进行，相信随着农村技术革命和文化革命的推进，一定会普遍开展起来，成为农业丰产不可缺少的一项措施。
    群众自办水文好处多
    从上面可以看到，千千万万的群众性水利工程的规划设计和管理运用，广大地区人民的生活和生产，都要以水文观测作为耳目。国家设立的水文测站网的数量虽然不少，但和广大地区的需要比较究竟有限，不可能周到地为所有的地区服务。因此，用两条腿走路，即除国家投资举办水文站网作为骨干以外，由群众自办一些小型的简易的水文站网为当地服务，是多快好省和全面地满足各方面需要的好办法。中央提出的农业发展纲要第二十二条里，便规定了“在十二年内，基本上建成气象台站网和水文测站网，……以便预防水、旱、风、冻等自然灾害”。谭震林书记在1957年冬的沙颖河治理工作座谈会上，也提出希望所有农业社都有一个简易的雨量设备，由专人负责记录雨量，并对水利工程进行观测工作。
    去年有好些省份已办起群众水文站了。有许多县，还设了几十个雨量站，若干地下水位站和查墒点。这些群众自办的水文站点，在国家站网的技术帮助下，因陋就简、就地取材地置备了一些简单的观测用具，并做到随测随用为当地当前的生产服务，因而很受各地党政领导的重视。
    现在群众水文工作有的地区还没有很好开展起来，已开展的也需要进一步巩固和提高。推行群众水文工作，首先要突破思想关，使领导和群众都认识到水文工作的作用。并破除“水文工作是技术员专家的事，庄稼汉干不了，赔钱耽误工”的迷信思想。其次，要过技术关。国家水文站网要起骨干作用，技术上门帮助群众。第三是服务关，要做到测而为用，随测随用，当时见效。这样，领导重视，群众满意，工作也就容易巩固了。
    两千多年以前，勤劳勇敢的我国人民就曾在四川都江堰的宝瓶口（地名）上，刻石为尺，观测水位高低，用以控制分流情况。三、四百年前的明、清时代，在黄河中下游就已有报汛制度。涨水的时候，用驿马飞报，也能跑在洪水的前面。我们相信在新中国，干劲冲天的农民，在中国共产党的领导下，有着比千百年前高得多的技术装备和科学知识，一定可以大办水文工作。
