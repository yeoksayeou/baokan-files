Between Mother and Son
Lu Hong

Mom is usually busy with work and doesn't have time to think about Xiao Pang (Little Fatty). Last night, she was a bit more free and missed her son so much that she couldn't sleep. Xiao Pang didn't come home because of school activities. It's been a week since they last met, and Mom misses her son terribly! Has he grown taller? Is his little face still so round? How are his grades? These questions kept spinning in Mom's mind. Although it was Sunday, and it was snowing heavily outside with the northwest wind howling, Mom got up even earlier than usual. She picked up her small bag and went out of the city to see her son.

Mom walked into the Dean's office. The counselor greeted her and warmly invited her to sit down on a chair, while sending a young student to find her son on the playground. After a while, a little boy shouted loudly outside the door, "Report!" Following that, a little boy wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers pushed the door open, raising his right hand in a Young Pioneer salute to the counselor. The counselor smiled and said to the child, "Your mother has come to see you." The son quickly turned around and gave his mother a salute as well, as serious as a little soldier. Mom couldn't help but grin and called out her son's nickname, "Xiao Pang," happily pulling her son into her arms and kissing him. The little student standing next to them couldn't help but laugh. Xiao Pang quickly broke free from his mother's embrace, his little face flushed with embarrassment. He took his mother's hand and said, "Mom, let's go to my dorm."

Going to the dorm required crossing the wide playground. On the playground, children were playing in groups: some were making snowmen, some were having snowball fights, and some stopped to look at Xiao Pang and his mother with envious eyes. Mother and son walked hand in hand, chatting intimately. The son answered Mom's concerns endlessly. Mom nodded and smiled contentedly. Sometimes, when Xiao Pang was happy, he would bump his little head into his mother like a little lamb. At this time, Mom deliberately asked her son, "Why did you blush just now? Don't you like Mom kissing you?" Xiao Pang tilted his head and glanced at Mom with his bright, sparkling eyes, mischievously smiling and saying, "No, I want Mom to kiss me, I want Mom to kiss me, but I just can't let my classmates see, otherwise they will laugh at me." Mom understood and smiled. Yes, her son was already a Young Pioneer wearing a red scarf, not a child living in kindergarten anymore. But in Mom's heart, her son was always a child, even if her son grew a beard, he would still be a child in Mom's eyes, let alone the current Xiao Pang!

A spacious and clean bedroom with a row of large windows facing south. The sunshine shone through the glass onto every little bed in the room. Outside the windows, ancient trees stood tall. At this time, the dormitory was empty, with only a dozen small beds arranged on both sides. The beds were all covered with white sheets, and the colorful quilts were folded into squares and neatly arranged. Mom praised, "Xiao Pang, your room is so clean, I think it can compare with the housekeeping of the People's Liberation Army soldiers!" Xiao Pang was extremely proud to hear his mother's praise. He took his mother's hand and walked to his bed, pointing to the bed and saying to his mother, "Mom, this is my bed, please sit down." Mom sat on the bed and suddenly exclaimed to her son, "Oh! Why are you only laying one white sheet? Are you sleeping on this wooden bed like this? Where is the mattress? Did you lose it?" Seeing his mother's expression, the son was really surprised. He thought to himself, did he do something wrong? He replied timidly:
"The mattress wasn't lost. A classmate of ours is washing his quilt and doesn't have anything to cover himself with. I originally had a cotton quilt folded in half to use as a mattress. But I thought that on such a cold day, he would freeze if he didn't have a quilt. So, I lent him the quilt that I was using as a mattress." Listening to her son's words, Mom looked out the window at the swirling snow, and subconsciously touched the hard bed that her son slept on. With a frown, she felt sorry that her son might be cold, and couldn't help but ask, "Aren't you cold sleeping on the bare board?" Xiao Pang replied enthusiastically and affirmatively, "No, not cold at all. My quilt is big, I cover half of myself with it, and use the other half as a mattress, then I put my cotton-padded jacket and trousers on top of the quilt, so I don't get cold." Mom was touched by her son's "putting others before himself" behavior, and repeatedly said, "That's right, you did the right thing. You should take care of your classmates, they are young and easily get cold." Hearing these words from his mother, Xiao Pang's little face showed a smile, shining with a red glow, feeling extremely happy!

On the way back, what had just happened kept replaying in Mom's mind. She couldn't help but mutter to herself, "Oh! That was close! Out of love for my son, I almost unintentionally spread the selfish idea of 'putting oneself before others' to him. A child's pure heart is so lovely! I really didn't expect that what I usually tell him about respecting teachers and caring for classmates has been firmly remembered in his little heart and put into action. What good qualities!" The son's behavior deeply educated Mom, making her increasingly aware of how to consolidate and cultivate her child's selfless good qualities with her motherly love in every detail of daily life, allowing the great communist ideology to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in her child's heart. What a glorious and important responsibility it is to be a mother! Mom's mind was filled with the image of the Young Pioneer in a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers, wearing a red scarf, raising his right hand to salute her. A happy and proud smile appeared on Mom's face, and she murmured, "Good lad, truly our good son! He is only eleven years old this year!"

    母子之间
    陆红
    妈妈平时工作忙，没工夫想到小胖，昨夜清闲了一些，想儿子想得睡不着。小胖因为学校有活动，没有回家。已经一个星期不见面了，妈妈多么想念儿子呀！长高了没有？小脸蛋还是那么圆吗？学习成绩怎样？这些问题老在妈妈脑中转。这天虽然是星期日，窗外还下着大雪，西北风呼呼地吼着。妈妈反而比平日起得更早。她提起小包要出城去看儿子。
    妈妈走进了教导处，辅导员同志迎着她，热情地请她在一把椅子上坐下，一边打发一位小同学去操场找她的儿子。一会，一个小男孩高声在门外喊：“报告！”跟着，一个穿蓝布棉袄裤的小男孩推门进来了，举起右手朝着辅导员行了个少年先锋队的队礼。辅导员含笑对孩子说：“妈妈来看你了。”儿子急转身向妈妈也行了个队礼，严肃得像个小兵，妈妈却忍不住咧嘴笑了，还叫着儿子的乳名“小胖”，高兴得一把将儿子拉到怀里就亲。站在旁边的小同学看着都笑出声来了。小胖赶快从妈妈怀里挣脱出来，羞红了小脸。拉着妈妈的手说：“妈妈，到我宿舍去坐吧。”
    去宿舍要经过广阔的操场。操场上小朋友成群结队地在玩：有的做雪人，有的打雪仗，也有的停下来用羡慕的眼光看看小胖和他的妈妈。母子俩手拉手亲切地边走边谈着。儿子滔滔不息地回答妈妈关心的问题。妈妈点头满意地笑着。有时小胖高兴了，像小羊羔似的用小脑袋撞到妈妈身上。这时妈妈故意问儿子：“刚才你为什么脸红了？你不喜欢妈妈吻你吗？”小胖歪着头用亮晶晶的小眼瞅妈妈一眼，顽皮地笑着说：“不，要妈妈亲，要妈妈亲，可就是不能叫同学们看见，不然他们会笑话我的。”妈妈会意地笑了。是呀，儿子已是个戴红领巾的少先队员，而不是住在幼儿园的幼儿了。但是在妈妈的心中，儿子永远是个幼儿，即使儿子长了胡子，在妈妈心目中还是个孩子，何况现在的小胖呢！
    一间宽敞整洁的卧室，一排朝南开着的大窗户，晴天的阳光透过玻璃照射到房里每张小床上。窗外一棵棵古老的大树矗立着。这时，宿舍空无一人，只有十几张小床排列在两旁，床上都铺着白色的床单，彩色的棉被折叠成四方形一顺溜摆着。妈妈赞赏地说：“小胖，你们的房间真是整洁，我看可以和解放军叔叔的内务比美了！”小胖听妈妈称赞，得意极啦，拉着妈妈的手就往自己床边走，指着床对妈妈说：“妈妈，这是我的床，你坐吧。”妈妈往床上一坐，突然对着儿子惊叫起来：“呀！怎么你只铺一床白床单？你就这样睡在这木板床上吗？床上的垫被那去了？丢了吗？”儿子看妈妈这种神气，真使他大吃一惊，心里想，难道自己做的事错了吗？他胆怯地回答说：
  “垫被没有丢，我们有一个小同学拆洗被子了，没有盖的。我本来就是一条棉被双折着垫的，我想这样冷的天，他不盖棉被会冻坏的，于是我就把这床垫在床上的棉被借给他了。”妈妈听着儿子的话，眼望着窗外纷飞的大雪，下意识地又用手摸摸儿子睡的硬板床，紧皱着眉头，心痛儿子会挨冷，情不自禁地问儿子：“睡在光板上你不冷吗？”小胖热情肯定地回答：“不，一点也不冷，我的棉被大，盖一半，垫一半，再把棉袄裤盖在棉被上，冻不着。”妈妈被儿子这种“先人后己”的行为感动了，连连说：“对，你做得对，应当爱护小同学，他们年幼，容易冻坏。”小胖听了妈妈这番话，小脸露出了微笑，闪着红光，感到无比的幸福！
  在归途中，刚才发生的事老在妈妈脑中盘旋。她不禁自言自语道：“呀！好悬呀！为了爱儿子，无意中差一点把‘先己后人’这种自私的思想传播给他了。赤子之心多么可爱呀！真没有想到，平时我告诉他要尊敬老师爱护同学的话已牢牢记在他小小的心灵中，并贯彻到行动中了。多么好的品质呀！”儿子的行为深深教育了妈妈，使妈妈越来越感到应如何在点点滴滴的日常生活中，用自己的母爱来巩固和培育孩子这种大公无私的好品质，让伟大的共产主义思想在孩子的心灵里生根、开花、结果。作为一个母亲的责任是何等光荣又重大呀！妈妈的脑海里又浮现出那个穿蓝布棉袄裤带红领巾的少先队员，高举着右手向她行队礼的样子。妈妈脸上流露出幸福自豪的微笑，喃喃地说：“好小伙子，真是我们的好儿子！他今年才满十一岁呀！”
