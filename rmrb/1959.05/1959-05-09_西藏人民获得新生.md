Fellow Representatives:
	We fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

	Now, we will make a joint statement on the Tibet issue.

	The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, conspiring with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion, attempting to split Tibet from the motherland and place it under the reactionary rule of imperialism again, to perpetually maintain the extremely dark and backward serf system. This rebellion aroused unanimous condemnation from the Tibetan clergy and laity and the people of all ethnic groups across the country. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the order of the State Council and at the request of the Tibetan clergy and laity, quickly quelled the rebellion, consolidated and safeguarded the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups, and accelerated the democratization of Tibet and the new life of the Tibetan people. People across the country and the world have expressed their joy and encouragement at this, while imperialists and foreign reactionaries openly supported the Tibetan rebel groups, stirred up hostility towards our country, clamored for Tibet's "independence," crudely interfered in our internal affairs, and attempted to split Tibet from the unified family of all ethnic groups in our country to establish a so-called "independent state," which would actually become a foreign colony and protectorate. We, along with all the representatives present and the people of the whole country, express our boundless indignation at this.

	As everyone knows, Tibet has been a part of China since ancient times, and the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique is a heinous act of treason. However, foreign reactionaries have actually referred to our Tibet region as an "independent country," inheriting the mantle of British imperialism's aggression against Tibet. They have ceaselessly linked Tibet with "independence." The purpose of foreign reactionaries' fanning the flames is to undermine the unity and solidarity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and realize their political ambitions.

	The Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in our country understand that the "independence" or "autonomy" clamored for by foreign reactionaries is another name for splitting the Chinese nation, dividing Chinese territory, and undermining Chinese unity. In the past, British imperialism wanted to invade and occupy Tibet, and it used "Tibetan independence" as a guise. The Chinese people have fresh memories of this. When Japanese imperialism wanted to annex Northeast China, it also used the banner of "independence" to create a so-called "Manchukuo." On the eve of the "July 7th" Resistance War, Japanese imperialism used the same trick to create a "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Government" not far from Beijing. The foreign reactionaries' loud cries for "independence" for Tibet cannot but remind people of the conspiracies and intrigues of British and Japanese imperialism in those years. "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future." We Chinese people cannot forget these historical lessons.

	Some people say that Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, was an Indian, and Tibetans believe in Buddhism, so Tibet is a branch of India in terms of culture. Using this as a "reason" to express so-called "feelings" for Tibet and separate it from China is clearly untenable. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, which belongs to Israel, so do all countries and nations that believe in Christianity become a branch of Israel today? This "cultural branch" argument cannot cover up the true purpose of the "sympathy" for the rebel elements that cannot be confessed. Is it only a minority of rebel elements in Tibet who believe in Buddhism, and not the one million and several hundred thousand Tibetans who live and work in peace and contentment in Tibet who also believe in Buddhism? Why is there such deep-rooted affection only for the rebel elements who ride on the heads of the Tibetan people, while the one million and several hundred thousand Tibetan people who have been exploited to the bone by these rebel elements for generations are "left to die," and their suffering is "overlooked"? Obviously, the real reason for sympathizing with the rebel elements while not caring about the Tibetan people has nothing to do with Buddhism. What dominates here is not a religious issue, not religious piety, but political ulterior motives.

	Foreign reactionaries say that our suppression of the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique is an "atrocity" and so-called "elimination of freedom." This is slander against China. Such words cannot deceive people. Facts have proved that after the rebellion was quelled, the broad masses of the Tibetan clergy and laity truly had the freedom to be masters of their own affairs. The "three great mountains" (seals, army, and whips) weighing on the heads of the Tibetan people collapsed, and the Tibetan people truly embarked on the bright road of freedom and democracy.

	If one insists on saying that the Chinese people have "eliminated" the freedom of Tibet, then what kind of freedom has been "eliminated"? First of all, the "freedom" to betray the motherland and undermine the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country; in addition, there is also the "freedom" to exploit millions of serfs to the bone, the "freedom" to kill people, and the "freedom" to use human kneecaps as wooden fish and leg bones as flutes. Shouldn't such "freedoms" be "eliminated"? It is no accident that Indian interventionist elements expressed regret over the failure of the rebel elements who possessed these so-called "freedoms." They have come forward one after another to speak for the rebel elements, accusing the Tibetan people of not being able to stand up, saying that the Chinese people have "eliminated" the "freedom" of Tibet. All this thoroughly exposes the true colors of these interventionists.

	There are also some people who say that China has undermined the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." This statement is particularly absurd and ridiculous. The Chinese people have always cherished Sino-Indian friendship and adhered to the Five Principles. Even when imperialists and foreign reactionaries were fanning the flames, they still prioritized Sino-Indian friendship and the Five Principles. If people think calmly, it is not difficult to find that there are indeed people undermining the "Five Principles," supporting the Tibetan rebel group, and interfering in China's internal affairs, and these people are precisely foreign reactionaries.

	Imperialists and foreign reactionaries portray the Tibetan rebellion as an "uprising" or a "revolution." In fact, this Tibetan rebellion is, without a doubt, a genuine case of treason instigated by imperialists and foreign reactionaries. It is not a religious issue, nor is it a national issue. Facts have proved that some rebel elements have fled to India, but they have not taken religion away with them. The people in Tibet still believe in religion as usual. The people of Tibet helped the People's Liberation Army quell the rebellion and helped eliminate the remnants of the rebellion. Right here in our People's Congress, Tibetan people's representatives and representatives of all ethnic groups are gathered together to discuss national affairs, and the Tibetan people's representatives support the measures taken by the Central People's Government to quell the rebellion, expressing boundless anger at the rebel elements and conducting a solemn condemnation. All of this proves that the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country are united as one. There is no "national issue" in China as some people with ulterior motives have said.

	We want to warn imperialists and foreign reactionaries that the Tibetan people, with the support of the people of the whole country, have stood up and are marching towards the bright road of democracy. Imperialists and any reactionaries who want to reverse the wheels of history will not succeed. Tibet will always be a part of China, and Tibet will always be the Tibet of the Chinese people, and it will never be Tibet that a few rebel elements can freely manipulate, freely sell out, or freely give away as a gift to others. This is an unshakable fact, like the Himalayas. If imperialists and foreign reactionaries continue to be enemies of the people of all ethnic groups in China and insist on splitting Tibet from China, they will inevitably suffer even greater and more shameful defeats.

　　西藏人民获得新生

　鲍鼎　饶兴礼代表的联合发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告和彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在我们就西藏问题作联合发言。
    西藏上层反动集团，阴谋勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，发动了武装叛乱，妄图把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，把西藏重新置于帝国主义反动统治之下，长远保持极端黑暗落后的农奴制度。这一叛乱引起西藏僧俗人民和全国各族人民的一致声讨，中国人民解放军根据国务院的命令和西藏僧俗人民的要求，迅速平定了叛乱，巩固和保卫了祖国的统一和民族的团结，加速了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。全国和全世界人民对此莫不表示欢欣鼓舞，而帝国主义者和外国反动派公开支持西藏叛乱集团，大肆煽动敌视我国的情绪，叫嚣西藏“独立”，粗暴地干涉我国内政，企图从我国各民族统一的大家庭中把西藏分裂出去，成立所谓“独立国”，实际上成为外国的殖民地和保护国。我们跟到会的全体代表和全国人民一样，对此表示无比的愤怒。
    大家都知道，自古以来，西藏就是中国的一部分，西藏上层反动集团的叛乱乃是罪大恶极的叛国事件。但是，外国反动派却居然指着我国的西藏地方，说成是一个“独立国家”，这是继承了英帝国主义侵略我国西藏的衣钵。他们把西藏和“独立”联到一起，叫嚣不休。外国反动派煽风点火的目的在于破坏我国各族人民的统一和团结，实现其政治上的野心。
    西藏人民和我国各族人民都懂得，外国反动派所叫嚣的“独立”或“自治”，是分裂中国民族、分割中国领土、破坏中国统一的别名。过去，英帝国主义要侵占西藏，就是以“西藏独立”作幌子的。我国人民记忆犹新。日本帝国主义要吞并我国的东北，也打着“独立”的招牌，搞出一个所谓“满洲国”。在“七七”抗战的前夕，日本帝国主义又用同样的手法，在离北京不远的地方，搞出个“冀东防共自治政府”。外国反动派对西藏的大喊“独立”，不能不使人联想起当年英、日帝国主义的阴谋诡计。“前事不忘，后事之师”，我们中国人民是忘不了这些历史教训的。
    有人说，创立佛教的释迦牟尼是印度人，西藏人是信仰佛教的，因此西藏在文化方面是印度的分枝。用这个作“理由”来说明对西藏的所谓“感情”，把西藏从中国分裂出去，这显然是站不住脚的。耶稣出生在属于以色列的伯利恒，难道今天一切信奉耶稣教的国家和民族，都成了以色列的什么分枝吗？这种“文化分枝”的说法，掩盖不了“同情”叛乱分子的那个无法告人的真正目的。难道西藏的少数叛乱分子信仰佛教，现在西藏安居乐业的一百几十万西藏人，就不是信仰佛教的吗？为什么只对骑在西藏人民头上的叛乱分子，有根深蒂固的感情，而对受这批叛乱分子世世代代敲骨吸髓的一百十几万西藏人民，却“见死不救”，对他们的痛苦，却“熟视无睹”呢？显然可见，同情叛乱分子，而毫不关心西藏人民的真实原因，是与佛教毫无关系的。在这里起支配作用的，不是什么宗教方面的问题，不是宗教的虔诚心，而是政治上的别有用心。
    外国反动派说我国平息西藏上层反动集团的叛乱是“暴行”，是所谓“消灭自由”。这是对中国的诽谤。这种话是欺骗不了人的。事实证明，在叛乱平息后，西藏广大僧俗人民真正有了当家作主的自由，压在西藏人民头上的“三座大山”（印玺、军队、法鞭）崩溃了，西藏人民真正走上了自由民主的光明大道。
    如果硬要说中国人民“消灭”了西藏的自由，那么，是什么样的自由遭到了“消灭”呢？首先是背叛祖国的“自由”，破坏全国各民族大团结的“自由”；此外，还有对千百万农奴进行敲骨吸髓的剥削的“自由”，杀人的“自由”，用人的膝盖骨作木鱼、用腿骨作笛子的“自由”。这类“自由”，难道不应遭到“消灭”吗？印度干涉主义分子对据有这些所谓“自由”权力的叛乱分子的失败表示惋惜，那绝不是偶然的。他们纷纷挺身而出，为叛乱分子讲话，指责西藏老百姓不该翻身，说中国人民“消灭”了西藏的“自由”，这一切彻底暴露了这些干涉者的真面目。
    还有一些人说中国破坏了“和平共处五项原则”，这种说法特别显得荒唐可笑。中国人民一向珍贵中印友谊，遵守五项原则，即使在帝国主义和外国反动派煽风点火之时，也是以中印友谊和五项原则为重的。人们如果冷静地想一想，那就不难发现确实有人在破坏“五项原则”，支持西藏叛乱集团，干涉中国内政，而这些人恰恰就是外国反动分子。
    帝国主义和外国反动派把西藏的叛乱事件说成是“起义”、是“革命”。其实，这次西藏叛乱事件，不折不扣，是一个货真价实的由帝国主义和外国反动派策动的叛国案。它不是一个宗教问题，它不是一个民族问题。事实证明，有些叛乱分子逃到印度去了，他们并没有把宗教带跑，西藏地方的人民，还照样在信教。西藏地方的人民帮助人民解放军，平息叛乱，帮助肃清叛乱的残匪；就在我们人民代表大会上，西藏人民代表和各族人民代表，济济一堂，共同商议国家大事，以及西藏人民代表，拥护中央人民政府平息叛乱的措施，对叛乱分子无比愤怒，进行严正的声讨。这一些都证明藏族人民和国内各族人民，是团结一致的。我们中国并没有发生别有用心的人所说的：“民族问题”。
    我们要警告帝国主义和外国反动派，西藏人民在全国人民支持下，已经站起来了，正在向着民主光明的大道迈进，帝国主义和任何反动派要想扭转历史的车轮是办不到的，西藏永远是中国的一部分，西藏永远是中国人民的西藏，而决不是少数叛乱分子可以自由摆布，可以自由出卖，可以当成礼物自由送给别人的西藏。这是像喜马拉雅山一样，不可动摇的事实。帝国主义和外国反动派如果继续与中国各族人民为敌，硬要把西藏从中国分裂出去，必然要遭到更大、更可耻的失败。
