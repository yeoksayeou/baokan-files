    About Sports Films
    Yuan Dan
    People who live in the countryside and far away from big cities often regret that they cannot see many wonderful ball games and sports performances. Even people who live in big cities often sigh in vain at the "field" because they can't buy tickets, wishing they could feast their eyes. So, I thought of movies. If more sports documentaries could be made to present those wonderful shots to the audience, how great that would be.
    However, there don't seem to be many such documentaries at present. Therefore, I think it still seems necessary to strengthen the shooting of sports documentaries.
    People like to watch sports documentaries, and sports feature films are even more popular. In the few years since the founding of the country, our sports undertakings have developed greatly, new talents have emerged, and technical levels have greatly improved. Compiling and producing the growth process of these new talents into movies will undoubtedly have great educational significance. Of course, making sports feature films has its special difficulties, the main one being that it is not easy to train actors. But I think nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind on it, and the problem can still be solved. Besides, we do have some successful experiences, such as "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" for example.

    关于体育片
    沅单
    长住乡下和远离大城市的人，有很多精彩的球类比赛和体育表演都无法看到，常常引为憾事。即使是住在大城市的人吧，也常常因为买不到票而望“场”兴叹，恨不能一饱眼福。于是，我想起了电影。假如能多拍一些体育纪录片，让那些精彩的镜头呈现于观众面前，那该多么好。
    可是，像这样的纪录片目前似乎还不太多。因此我认为加强体育纪录片的拍摄工作，似乎还是有必要的。
    体育纪录片人们喜欢看，体育故事片那就更不用说。建国几年来，我们的体育事业有很大发展，新人辈出，技术水平有很大提高，把这些新人的成长过程等等，编写和摄制成电影，无疑会有很大的教育意义。当然，摄制体育故事片有它的特殊的困难，主要的是培养演员不容易。但是我想天下无难事，只怕有心人，问题还是可以解决的。何况我们确实已经有了一些成功的经验，比如“女篮五号”就是一个例子。
