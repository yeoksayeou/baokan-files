Comrade Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959. Now I would like to offer some opinions on water conservancy work in Shaanxi Province and my personal experiences:

In 1958, water conservancy construction in our province, like in other parts of the country, took a great leap forward unprecedentedly. Through a year of effort, the people of the entire province, wave after wave, expanded the irrigated area by 21.43 million mu, which is more than six times the irrigated area accumulated over thousands of years before liberation, and three and a half times the area developed before 1957 after liberation, reaching a total of 31.16 million mu. This increased the proportion of irrigated land from 17.7 percent to 56.7 percent. We also controlled soil erosion over an area of 30,437 square kilometers, reaching a total of 51,768 square kilometers, which is one and a half times the area improved before 1957. This raised the proportion of controlled soil erosion area out of the total area with soil erosion from 15.5 percent to 37.3 percent. These are the main achievements. Secondly, we have also built a number of flood control and drainage projects, and completed 33 small hydropower stations and 630 hydraulic stations. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward have transformed harmful rivers in many areas into beneficial rivers, taming them to flow onto high plateaus and mountains. Boulder-strewn cellars have become granaries, desert land has become golden and silver beaches, and low-yielding ridges and slopes have been transformed into high-yielding terraced fields, creating important material conditions for bumper harvests of grain and cotton. The achievements in water conservancy construction over the past year have been tremendous. This is a great victory for the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and a great victory for the Party's leadership in the mass water conservancy movement. I would like to share some of my experiences on the following issues.

Strengthen centralized leadership, continue to mobilize the masses, work hard and painstakingly, and overcome the water conservancy hurdle.

(1) Our province is a region with many mountains, plateaus, and loess soils. Rainfall is uneven, and drought is the main threat. However, the climate is mild and the soil is fertile. As long as water and fertilizer are sufficient, crops can achieve very high yields. The existing irrigated land accounts for 56.7 percent of the cultivated land, which is a significant increase compared to the past. However, a considerable portion of the cultivated land is still not guaranteed irrigation, and one-third of the existing irrigated land has a low water supply guarantee capacity due to a lack of reliable sources. Another third can generally be guaranteed water in normal years, but in drier years, the water supply is reduced and irrigation is insufficient. The loess hilly area in northern Shaanxi Province is the most severely affected area by soil erosion in the Yellow River basin. The area that has been initially controlled is still less than half of the total area with soil erosion. Therefore, I believe that our province has not yet overcome the water conservancy hurdle. We must strengthen centralized leadership, continue to mobilize the masses, and work hard and painstakingly to build water conservancy projects to ensure continuous increases in agricultural production.

Focus on the water conservancy development of mountains and plateaus, combining storage, diversion, and pumping, and combining large, medium, and small projects.

(2) In 1958, we thoroughly implemented the "three-main" guiding principle for water management and achieved great success. Based on the characteristics of our province, we must further implement the policy of emphasizing storage, combining storage, diversion, and pumping; and emphasizing small-scale projects, combining large, medium, and small-scale projects. Only in this way can we comprehensively solve the problem, because our mountain and plateau farmland accounts for 75 percent of the total cultivated land area. Most of these areas are high in elevation, low in water availability, and have scarce water resources. The existing proportion of irrigated land is mostly in river valleys and mountain streams. Water conservancy facilities in mountainous and plateau areas are weak and lacking. In response to the characteristics of mountains and plateaus, we have implemented the above-mentioned policies, and a new situation emerged in 1958. Medium and small-sized reservoirs have been greatly developed. The water storage irrigation projects built can store a total of more than 1.7 billion cubic meters of water, which is more than 27 times the total storage capacity of over 60 million cubic meters before 1957. Long-distance water diversion projects to mountains and plateaus have also been greatly developed. "Mountain-encircling canals," "long vines bearing gourds," and "canal-dam combinations" were built to bring water to high mountains and plateaus. For example, the Wuzhangyuan in Mei County and the Changshouyuan in Weinan have been irrigated. In particular, large-scale pumping irrigation projects have been developed. The Weihui Canal highland irrigation project was completed in just over half a year. This project has a total of 17 pumping stations, equipped with 51 electric pumps with a total capacity of 12,701 kilowatts, diverting a flow of 22 cubic meters per second, with a maximum head of 73.7 meters, enabling a large portion of the fertile land in the northern Weibei highlands to be irrigated. The masses reflected that these places, where even drinking water for people and livestock was difficult in the past, are now irrigated, which they never dreamed of before. In the spring of last year, 12,000 people in Hu County went up the mountain and worked hard for 50 days, focusing on the comprehensive management of a large mountainous area in the Qinling Mountains, controlling soil erosion over an area of 425 square kilometers, and expanding irrigation by 14,870 mu, creating a model for soil and water conservation in rocky high mountains. Based on the characteristics of our province, in the future, we must focus on the water conservancy development of mountains and plateaus, and use a combination of storage, diversion, and pumping, and a combination of large, medium, and small-scale projects, comprehensively manage and centrally manage them in order to solve the problems of water conservancy and soil and water conservation, and ensure continuous increases in agricultural production.

The focus of water conservancy development is on the Weibei highlands and the Wuding River hilly areas along the Wei, Jing, and Luo Rivers and their tributaries.

(3) Overall planning and basin planning are important and indispensable. The focus of our province's major advance towards water conservancy development of mountains and plateaus is on the Weibei highlands, which are the Wei, Jing, and Luo Rivers and their tributaries, and the Wuding River hilly areas. The Wei, Jing, and Luo Rivers flow through the central part of our province, and the soil is fertile, making it a major base for wheat and cotton. It has a cultivated area of 37 million mu, of which about 20 million mu are irrigated, but some have insufficient water sources and low guarantee capacity. In order to solve the water conservancy problems in this vast heartland area, water conservancy planning and design work has been repeatedly carried out last year, and engineering institutions have been established. Some projects have already started construction.

The Wei, Jing, Luo, and Wuding Rivers have a total of 19 major projects, including (1) the Baojixia irrigation and power generation project on the Wei River, diverting 50 cubic meters per second of water, which can irrigate 1.76 million mu, with an installed capacity of 30,000 kilowatts; (2) the Dafosi Reservoir on the Jing River, with a dam height of 62 meters, storing 990 million cubic meters of water, irrigating 3.12 million mu (including the original 1.02 million mu), with an installed capacity of 80,000 kilowatts (including the hub and drop structures); (3) the Nanchengli Reservoir on the Luo River, with a dam height of 67 meters, storing 140 million cubic meters of water, irrigating 2.4 million mu; (4) the Wuding River has six reservoirs, including Xinqiao, Jiucheng in Jingbian, and Hekoumiao, and the Yuxi River water diversion project, which can irrigate a total of 2.5 million mu. Among the above-planned projects, the Baojixia irrigation and power generation project on the Wei River and the Dafosi Reservoir project on the Jing River have already started construction, and the Xinqiao Reservoir and Jiucheng Reservoir have been completed. The Wei, Jing, Luo, Wuding, and other rivers are major tributaries of the Yellow River. I believe that the management and utilization of these rivers will not only have a great impact on the development of industry and agriculture in our province, but also have a significant impact on the management of the Yellow River and ensuring the function of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. These projects can be completed in stages within two to four years.

Scientific experiments and research must be combined with the practice of water conservancy construction to create a scientific basis for the water conservancy development of mountainous and plateau areas.

(4) Combining scientific experiments and research with current production is very important. In the development of water conservancy construction, we have encountered many new problems that must be solved through scientific experiments and research. For example, the main canal of the Baojixia water diversion project passes along the edge of the loess plateau terrace, with a very large flow (50 cubic meters per second), and the canal is very high (some are 100 meters above the river valley) and must pass through important urban industrial areas, etc. There is a series of scientific research and design issues related to the subsidence and stability of loess canals; another example is the Dafosi Reservoir on the Jing River, which is a high loess homogeneous earth dam with a height of 62 meters and a dam body volume of 11 million cubic meters, which also has many complex technical problems. For this reason, we have obtained the cooperation of universities and scientific research institutions to carry out comprehensive scientific experiments and research work. From design to construction to management, we will be able to obtain systematic scientific data on water conservancy construction projects in loess areas, creating a scientific basis for water conservancy development in mountainous and plateau areas that is abundant, fast, good, and economical. The large-scale construction of soil and water conservation movement is an unprecedented initiative and a superior manifestation of the socialist system. This will bring about revolutionary changes in the transformation of nature and the impact on runoff changes. Its favorable trend is obvious, but quantitative data is incomplete. There is a lot of experimental data on small areas, but the data on the effects of large-scale and comprehensive effects are insufficient. For this reason, we have adopted a two-pronged approach that combines scientific units with mass scientific observation and research to carry out large-scale scientific research work in this area. We believe that this research work will yield preliminary results this year and complete scientific arguments in a few years.

Ensuring excellent project quality is the biggest saving in construction work.

(5) Ensuring excellent project quality is the biggest saving in construction work. In the Great Leap Forward last year, some water conservancy construction projects also had deviations that neglected quality. For example, some backfill in the Weihui Canal highland irrigation project was not compacted, local cracks occurred in the inverted siphon pipeline, and some medium-sized reservoirs had leakage in the foundation. These issues were immediately noticed and corrected. I believe that the design and construction methods of being plentiful, fast, good, and economical are consistent, interconnected, and must be a comprehensive leap forward; it is wrong to simply pursue speed and greed without paying attention to quality or saving materials and labor.

Finally, I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country's socialist construction cause will leap forward again and again and continue to achieve greater victories. We must solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian ambitious elements that your conspiracy to support a small number of rebellious elements in Tibet in an attempt to undermine the unity of all ethnic groups in China will never be realized. The torrent of the Chinese people's socialist construction cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. The Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and we will absolutely not allow any foreign aggressors to interfere. The water conservancy construction cause in Shaanxi Province will continue to leap forward in 1959, just like in other parts of the country. I myself must study more humbly, transform myself, go deep among the masses, and contribute my own strength to the people's water conservancy cause.

　　变害河为利河  变穷山为富山
    张寿荫代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告。现在我就陕西水利工作和个人体会讲一点意见：
    一九五八年我省水利建设同全国各地一样，向前大大的迈进了一步，是空前的大跃进。全省人民经过一年的努力，一个浪潮接一个浪潮的，共扩大灌溉面积二千一百四十三万亩，等于解放前几千年灌溉面积的六倍多，等于解放后一九五七年以前发展了的三倍半，连前达到了三千一百一十六万亩，使水地（田）面积的比重由百分之十七点七跃进到百分之五十六点七；控制水土流失面积三万零四百三十七平方公里，连前达到五万一千七百六十八平方公里，为一九五七年以前兴修的一倍半，占总水土流失面积的比重由百分之十五点五跃进到百分之三十七点三，这是主要的成绩。其次还修了不少的防洪、排涝工程并建成小型水电站三十三处，水力站六百三十处。大跃进的成就使不少地区的害河变成了利河，驯服的奔上了高塬、大山，乱石窖变成了米粮仓，沙漠地变成了金银滩，低产的梁峁变成了高产的梯田，为粮棉大丰收创造了重要的物质条件。一年来的水利建设成就是巨大的，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，是党领导群众大搞水利运动的伟大胜利。兹就以下几个问题讲一点体会。
    加强集中领导，继续发动群众，大干、苦干，闯过水利关
    （一）我省是一个山多、塬多、黄土多的地区，雨量不够均匀，旱灾威胁是主要的灾害，但气候温和，土壤肥沃，只要水、肥充足，农作物就能够获得很高的产量。现有水地（田）面积占耕地面积的百分之五十六点七，比过去有了很大的增加，但还有相当部分的耕地得不到灌溉的保证，而且现有的灌溉地中有三分之一是水源缺乏保证能力较低的水地（田），也还有近三分之一在一般年成水源可以保证，但较旱的年度则因水源减少而得不到充分的灌溉。我省的陕北黄土丘陵区是黄河流域水土流失最严重的地区，已经初步控制的面积还不到全部水土流失地区的一半。因此我认为我省的水利关还没有过，我们必须加强集中领导，继续发动群众，大干、苦干兴修水利，保证农业不断的增产。
    以山、塬水利化为中心，蓄、引、提相结合，大、中、小相结合
　　（二）一九五八年深入的贯彻了“三主”治水方针，获得了很大的成就。根据我省的特点也必须进一步贯彻以蓄为主，蓄、引、提相结合；以小型为主，大、中、小相结合的方针，才能够全面的解决问题，因为我们的山、塬耕地占到总耕地面积的百分之七十五，这些地区大部分是地高、水低、水少。已有的水地比重多在川地和山溪沟道之中，山地塬地的水利设施是薄弱的，缺乏的。针对山、塬的特点，我们贯彻执行了上述方针，一九五八年出现了新的局面。中小型水库有了很大的发展，所修蓄水灌溉工程共可蓄水十七亿余公方，等于一九五七年前共有蓄水能力六千余万公方的二十七倍多。长距离引水上山、上塬工程也有很大的发展，修“环山渠”“长藤结瓜”“渠坝结合”把水引上了高山、高塬，如郿县的五丈塬，渭南的长寿塬等都得到了灌溉化。特别是发展了大型抽水灌溉工程，在半年多的时间内完成了渭惠渠高塬灌溉工程。这项工程共有抽水机站十七处，装电动抽水机五十一台共一万二千七百零一瓩，引用流量二十二秒公方，最高扬程七十三点七公尺，使一大部分渭北高塬肥沃的土地得到灌溉化。群众反映：这些过去人畜饮水都困难的地方，现在地都浇上了水，真是以前做梦也梦不到的。鄠县人民在去年春季一万二千人上山，大干五十天，集中治理了秦岭一大块山区，控制水土流失面积四百二十五平方公里，扩灌一万四千八百七十亩，创造了治理土石高山的水土保持典型。根据我省特点，今后必须以山、塬水利化为中心，用蓄、引、提相结合，大、中、小相结合，全面治理，集中治理的方式才能够解决水利、水土保持问题，保证农业不断的增产。
    水利化的重心在渭、泾、洛河及其支流的渭北高塬和无定河丘陵山区
    （三）全面规划，流域规划是重要的，不可缺少的。我省向山、塬水利化大进军重心在渭北高塬，也就是渭、泾、洛河及其支流和无定河丘陵山区。渭、泾、洛三河流经我省中部，土壤肥沃是麦棉主要基地，有耕地面积三千七百万亩，现有灌溉地约二千万亩且有些水源不足保证能力不高，为了解决这一广大心脏地区水利问题，去年曾反复的进行了水利规划和设计工作，并成立了工程机构，部分工程已经开工。
    渭、泾、洛和无定河共有主要工程十九处，其中（1）渭河宝鸡峡灌溉发电工程，引水五十秒公方，可以灌溉一百七十六万亩，装机三万瓩；（2）泾河大佛寺水库，坝高六十二公尺，蓄水九点九亿公方，灌溉三百一十二万亩（包括原有一百零二万亩），装机八万瓩（包括枢纽及跌水等）；（3）洛河南城里水库，坝高六十七公尺，蓄水一点四亿公方，灌溉二百四十万亩；（4）无定河有新桥、靖边旧城、河口庙等六个水库及榆溪河引水工程共可灌溉二百五十万亩。在以上计划的工程中，渭河宝鸡峡灌溉发电工程、泾河大佛寺水库工程已经开工，新桥水库、旧城水库已经竣工。渭、泾、洛、无定等河是黄河主要支流，我认为这些河流的治理利用，不仅对我省工农业生产大发展作用很大，而且也对治理黄河，保证三门峡水库的作用有重大意义。这些工程可以在二至四年内次第完成。
    科学试验研究必须与水利建设的实践相结合，为山、塬地区的水利化创造科学依据
    （四）科学试验研究与当前生产相结合是十分重要的。我们在水利建设发展中，遇到了很多的新问题，必须进行科学试验研究来解决。如宝鸡峡输水干渠沿黄土高塬台地边沿通过，流量很大（五十秒公方），渠道很高（有的高出川地一百公尺）且须穿过重要城市工业区等对黄土渠道的沉陷稳定有一系列的科学研究和设计问题；又如泾河大佛寺水库为高达六十二公尺的黄土均质土坝，坝体土量一千一百万公方，也有不少复杂技术问题；为此我们取得了大专学校、科学研究单位的合作展开了综合的科学试验研究工作，从设计到施工，到管理，我们将能取得对黄土地区水利建筑工程系统的科学资料，为山塬地区水利化创造多、快、好、省的科学依据。大规模的兴修水土保持运动是空前未有的创举，是社会主义制度的优越表现。这将在改造自然，影响迳流变化上带来革命性的变化，它的有利趋势是明显的，但定量的数据是不完全的，小面积上的试验资料是不少的，但大面积的，综合的效果数据是不够的，为此我们采取科学单位与群众科学观测研究相结合的，两条腿走路的办法，大规模的开展了这方面的科学研究工作。我们相信，这一研究工作，在今年将得到初步的结果，在几年内可以得到完整的科学论据。
    保证优良的工程质量，是建设工作中的最大节约
    （五）保证优良的工程质量，就是建设工作中最大的节约，我们在去年大跃进中，在有的水利建设工程中，也产生过忽视质量的偏差，如在渭惠渠高塬灌溉工程上有的填土不实，倒虹管道发生局部裂缝和有的中型水库地基漏水等，立即引起了注意并得到了纠正。我认为多快好省的设计、施工方法是一致的，互相关联的，必须全面跃进；任何不重视质量，不节约材料、劳力，单纯的图快贪多，都是不对的。
    最后，我坚决相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我国的社会主义建设事业，一定会跃进再跃进，继续取得更大的胜利。我们要严正警告帝国主义和印度野心分子，你们支持西藏一小撮叛乱分子企图破坏中国各民族团结的阴谋，是永远不能实现的。中国人民奔向社会主义的建设洪流是任何反动力量都阻挡不住的。西藏问题是中国的内政，任何外国侵略者想来干涉，我们都是绝对不能容许的。陕西的水利建设事业，将同全国各地一样，在一九五九年将继续向前跃进。我自己要更加虚心的努力学习，改造自己，深入群众，为人民水利事业贡献自己的力量。
