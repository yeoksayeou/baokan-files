    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 18th: The number of minority cadres in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is growing rapidly. At present, the total number of minority cadres in the entire autonomous region has reached 47,061, almost double the number in 1954. A total of 13,245 minority cadres in the autonomous region have honorably joined the Communist Party of China, and 8,254 have joined the Communist Youth League. The number of ethnic minority cadres at or above the county level holding leadership positions has increased to 1,164.

    The vast majority of these ethnic minority cadres are activists who emerged during the various social movements after liberation. The Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the training of ethnic minority cadres. In addition to paying attention to helping them in their daily work, they have also established various colleges, schools, and training classes to select ethnic minority cadres in batches for rotational training or to organize them to visit, so as to improve their political level and professional ability in all aspects. Guangxi Nationalities Institute alone has trained 3,179 students from Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, Hui, Mulao, and Maonan ethnic groups since it was established in 1952.

    Most of the ethnic minority cadres at all levels in the autonomous region can set an example in their work and actively lead the masses of their own ethnic groups to carry out socialist construction. In Du'an Yao Autonomous County, more than 98% of the more than 240 district-level cadres were commended during the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture last year. Jia Laofang, a Miao deputy director of the Shanying Commune in the Da Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County, actively organized the masses to reclaim wasteland and plant trees in order to thoroughly change the backwardness of the alpine mountainous areas, and tried every means to lead the commune members to develop production, so that the local masses generally increased their income. The Da Miao Mountain County Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision calling on cadres of all ethnic groups to earnestly learn from Jia Laofang's fine qualities of consistently caring about the hardships of the masses. As a result, 986 cadres with these fine qualities emerged throughout the county, which greatly promoted various tasks.

    Ethnic minority cadres often receive cordial care from Han cadres in their work and study. Many Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres are united and help each other like brothers. Gen Jian, the current Miao secretary of the Secretariat of the Longsheng Autonomous County Committee of the Communist Party of China, was an ordinary soldier in the Guibei Revolutionary Guerrilla before liberation. After liberation, with the help of the previous three Han secretaries of the county, he learned to study the Party's policies and work methods of contacting the masses and mobilizing the masses. Over time, this Miao guerrilla fighter from a peasant background gradually grew up and finally took charge of leading the work of the entire county.

    团结各族人民建设社会主义
    广西少数民族干部成倍增长
    据新华社南宁18日电　广西僮族自治区少数民族干部迅速成长壮大。现在，全自治区少数民族干部总数已达四万七千零六十一人，比1954年几乎增长了一倍。全自治区已有一万三千二百四十五名少数民族干部光荣地参加了中国共产党，有八千二百五十四人参加了共青团。担任领导职务的县级以上的民族干部，已增加到一千一百六十四人。
    这批民族干部绝大多数是解放后在历次社会运动中涌现出来的积极分子。中共各级党委对培养民族干部极其重视，除在日常工作中注意多帮助他们外，还专门设立各种院、校和训练班，分次抽调民族干部轮流学习，或组织他们参观访问，从各方面提高他们的政治水平和业务能力。仅广西民族学院从1952年开办到现在，即训练了僮、瑶、苗、侗、回、仫佬、毛难等族学员三千一百七十九人。
    自治区各级少数民族干部在工作中大都能以身作则，积极带动本民族群众进行社会主义建设。都安瑶族自治县二百四十多名区级干部，在去年工农业大跃进中，有98％的人受到表扬。大苗山苗族自治县山鹰公社苗族副社长贾老芳为了彻底改变高寒山区的落后面貌，积极组织群众开荒、造林，千方百计地领导社员发展生产，使当地群众普遍增加了收入。中共大苗山县委曾作出决定，号召各族干部认真学习贾老芳一贯关心群众疾苦的优良品质，结果全县出现了具有这种优良品质的干部九百八十六名，大大推动了各项工作。
    少数民族干部在工作和学习中，经常得到汉族干部亲切关怀。许多汉族干部和少数民族干部像亲兄弟一般地团结互助。中共龙胜各族自治县委员会书记处现任苗族书记艮剑，在解放前夕是桂北革命游击队的一名普通战士，解放后，在这个县以前的三任汉族书记的帮助下，学会了钻研党的方针政策，以及联系群众、发动群众的工作方法，日长月久，这位农民出身的苗族游击队员，逐渐成长起来，终于担任了领导全县的工作。
