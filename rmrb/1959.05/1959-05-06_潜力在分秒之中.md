　　Potential Lies in Every Second
　　Zhang Jing
    A missed opportunity will not come again, time lost cannot be recovered, even by a team of horses.
    Time is invisible and intangible. In everyday life, the quiet passing of a minute or a second may seem insignificant. However, in modern factories and enterprises, as the degree of mechanization increases and the division of labor becomes more detailed, the concept of time becomes increasingly concrete. The efficiency of every process, every type of work, every machine, and even every worker's production activity is calculated in minutes and seconds. If each link can save a little time and correspondingly improve efficiency, then, by mutually promoting each other and accumulating small gains, the utilization rate of work hours can be greatly improved. Conversely, wasting a few minutes in one process can often affect the subsequent process, sometimes even affecting the overall situation and hindering the rhythmic progress of the entire production. To tap the potential of time from every minute and second, and to ensure the high-speed development of socialist construction, is a major undertaking and should not be taken lightly.
    How can we fully realize the potential of time? On this point, many factories have already made great achievements and accumulated a lot of experience, such as saving auxiliary labor time, carrying out technological innovation, changing process flows, and improving labor efficiency per unit of time. These are all good methods. In addition to this, there is another very important but often overlooked aspect, which is how to reasonably adjust labor organization and strictly organize production, to find the potential of work hours from labor organization without adding equipment or personnel. The practice of Wu Xiulun's team in the Quantai work area proves that the rational arrangement of labor organization has great potential. Wu Xiulun's team has a total of more than sixty people. The average daily progress of the team's tunneling in March increased three times compared to February. In April, they again overfulfilled their plan, not because their technical conditions and equipment conditions had changed, but simply because they strictly organized labor and made full use of every minute and second. This shows how important a source of work hours scientific organization of labor production can be!
    Some people believe that time is limited, and even if it is mined from labor organization, it will eventually be exhausted. This statement is only half correct. In terms of the prescribed working time, time is indeed limited. An hour has only sixty minutes, and a minute has only sixty seconds. A certain amount of work can only be completed in a certain amount of time, and the progress of any work is inevitably constrained by time. However, the potential of time changes with the changes in objective conditions. When conditions change, the limits of time will be broken. For example, under manual operation conditions, not much work can be done in a minute; under semi-mechanized conditions, the labor efficiency of one minute is much greater; and when fully mechanized, one minute can create great value. With the continuous improvement of technical level, the continuous development of technological revolution, and the continuous emergence of new conditions, the potential of time becomes greater and greater. In this sense, tapping the potential of time is endless. The question is whether leaders are good at grasping objective conditions and giving play to subjective initiative, and are good at discovering new potential under new conditions, so as to continuously revolutionize and continuously improve labor productivity.
    Of course, finding the potential of work hours from labor organization is not an easy task. Because labor organization is a complex whole of collective labor, it includes the work activities of each process, each type of work, and everyone participating in this labor organization. The potential of time is hidden in these specific work activities. If leading cadres do not go to the site in person and become familiar with the work of each process and type of work through working alongside the workers, they cannot understand the activities of the workers in every minute and second. Tapping the inherent potential of time is an extremely thorough and meticulous working process. Enterprise leaders must have the determination to seize every minute and second and a serious and meticulous working style. The approach of the Quantai area is worth learning.
    More than a month has passed in the second quarter, time is very precious, and we must firmly grasp time and make full use of every minute and second.

　　潜力在分秒之中
　　张竞
    机不可失，时不再来，分秒失误，驷马难追。
    时间，看不见，摸不到。在平常生活里，轻轻溜过一分一秒钟，也许很难觉察到有什么意义。可是，在现代化的工厂企业里，机械化程度越高，劳动的分工越细致，时间的概念就愈来愈具体每一道工序、每一种工种、每一部机器以至每一个工人的生产活动，都要从一分一秒的时间计算效率。如果各个环节都能节省一点时间，相应地提高效率，那末，相互推动，聚零为整，工时的利用率就可以大大提高。相反，一道工序上浪费了几分钟，往往就会使后一道工序受到影响，有时甚至牵动全局，妨碍整个生产的有节奏地进行。从一分一秒之中来发掘时间的潜力，来保证社会主义建设的高速度发展，这是一件大事，决不可等闲视之。
    怎样才能充分发挥时间的潜力呢？关于这一点，许多工厂已经做出了很大的成绩，积累了不少经验，如节省辅助劳动时间，开展技术革新，改变工艺过程，提高单位时间的劳动效率等等，这些都是很好的办法。除此以外，还有一个非常重要然而却容易被忽视的方面，就是如何合理地调整劳动组织，严密地组织生产，在不加设备不加人的情况下，从劳动组织中寻找工时的潜力。权台工区吴修伦大班的实践证明：劳动组织的合理安排，潜力很大。吴修伦大班一共六十多人，3月份全班掘进日进度比2月份平均提高了三倍。4月份又超额完成计划，并不是因为他们的技术条件和设备条件有什么改变，只是由于严密地组织劳动，充分利用一分一秒钟的时间。这说明科学的组织劳动生产该是一个多么重要的工时源泉！？
    有人认为，时间是有限的，即使从劳动组织中来挖掘，也有一天要挖光了的。这句话，只说对了一半。从规定的作业时间来说，时间确是有限的，一小时只有六十分，一分钟只有六十秒，在一定时间里只能完成一定数量的工作量，任何工作的进展都免不了要受时间的约束。但时间的潜力会随着客观条件的变化而变化，条件变了，时间的限度就会被冲破。譬如在手工操作的条件下，一分钟干不了多少活；在半机械化的条件下，一分钟的劳动效率就大得多，到了全部机械化的时候，一分钟就可以创造很大的价值。随着技术水平的不断提高，技术革命不断发展，新的条件不断出现，时间的潜力也就越来越大。从这个意义上来说，挖掘时间的潜力是永无止境的。问题是领导者要善于掌握客观的条件和发挥主观能动性，善于在新的条件下去发现新的潜力，从而不断革命，不断提高劳动生产率。
    当然，从劳动组织中寻找工时的潜力，并不是轻而易举的事情。因为劳动组织是一个复杂的集体劳动的整体，它包括各道工序各工种以及参加这个劳动组织的每个人的作业活动，时间的潜力就隐藏在这些具体的作业活动中，如果领导干部不亲自到现场去，从跟班劳动中熟悉各工序工种的作业情况，就不能了解工人在每分每秒钟里的活动。挖掘时间的内在潜力，是一个极其深入细致的工作过程。企业的领导人员必须具有分秒必争的决心和认真细致的工作作风。权台区的做法是值得学习的。
    二季度已经又过去一个多月了，时间十分宝贵，我们必须紧紧掌握时间，把一分一秒的时间充分利用起来。
