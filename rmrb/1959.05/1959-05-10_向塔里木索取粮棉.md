Requesting Grain and Cotton from the Tarim

Lin Haiqing, Commander of the First Agricultural Construction Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang

The Tarim River is the largest inland river in western China. Due to continuous river sedimentation, a vast alluvial plain has been created in the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River. It is located on the northern edge of the Southern Xinjiang Basin, west of the confluence of the Aksu River and the Yarkand River, and east to the Qunke area of Yuli County. According to reliable surveys, there are 16 million mu of arable land on both banks of the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River, of which approximately 6 million mu can be utilized with slight improvement. Water and soil resources are quite abundant. Moreover, the climate is mild, with an annual average temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, and an absolute frost-free period of up to 185 days, with an average frost-free period of 245 days. It is very suitable for growing various cotton and grain crops, and is an ideal base for developing a cotton and grain warehouse in the northwest of the motherland.

For many years, the Tarim River has always flowed leisurely and willfully. According to records, no one ever dared to approach it, and no one could understand it. The Uyghur people call it a "wild horse," which shows that our predecessors considered the ancient Tarim River to be mysterious and unpredictable. This was indeed the case: there were desolate forests and deserts, boundless and endless, with drought, sandstorms, birds and animals. In the dark past, the sinful reactionary rulers could not do anything about the Tarim River. Therefore, this "wild horse" could only wait for a heroic rider.

Where the red flag flies, the standard-bearer has arrived. The production troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, under the order of Chairman Mao, have shouldered the dual revolutionary task of defending and building the motherland since the first day of entering Xinjiang, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding a gun in one hand and a hoe (production tool) in the other. Through arduous struggle and fighting against the earth, they have created enormous wealth for the motherland and the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas. Therefore, the glorious task of resolutely subduing the Tarim and bravely mounting this magical "wild horse" fell on the shoulders of our production soldiers.

The First Agricultural Construction Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a heroic unit, was formerly the iron-willed 359th Brigade. It fought bravely in the north and south, and made immortal contributions to the people of the motherland. The Nanniwan Great Production Movement during the war years was even more famous at home and abroad. After entering Xinjiang, in order to develop and prosper the economic and cultural construction of all ethnic groups, they have been persisting in the Southern Xinjiang region, carrying out large-scale production activities, fighting against nature, and extracting wealth from nature. Over the past nine years, they have reclaimed more than one million mu of wasteland, harvested a large amount of grain and cotton, trained cadres, and gained experience, laying a solid foundation for the large-scale development of the Tarim River.

The formal development of the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River began in November 1957. The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Committee of the Communist Party of China all attached great importance to the development of the Tarim River Basin. After the development work began, strong support was given from the central to the local levels. Therefore, a tense situation of fighting against nature rapidly unfolded on both banks of the Tarim River, which had been desolate since ancient times. According to the plan, we must reclaim 10 million mu of land in the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River at the fastest speed, and then immediately develop the beautiful Yarkand River Basin.

Our troops entered the Tarim in the severe winter and immediately began the North Bank Canal water conservancy project and wasteland reclamation work. Due to difficult transportation and remote location, the development work at that time was very difficult. The living conditions of the troops were also very hard. They lived in tents and dug dugouts, and the food was not good. None of these difficulties overwhelmed the soldiers. The soldiers were all full of energy, overcoming wind, sand, and severe cold, clearing the way through thorns and brambles, and building their own green home on the Tarim banks of the ancient wilderness.

The proposal of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the encouragement of the national all-round Great Leap Forward situation have added new and tremendous strength to our development of the Tarim. The soldiers combined the glorious tradition of heroism, tenacity, and arduous struggle with the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. This quickly launched a vigorous wasteland reclamation competition movement centered on technological innovation. The result of large-scale mechanized wasteland reclamation by various units greatly accelerated the construction speed of the Tarim. For example, Victory No. 16 Farm reclaimed an average of 136 mu of wasteland per person in 1958, exceeding the target of 100 mu of wasteland per person called for by the Party Committee of the Division. Some people, with the cooperation of a small amount of machinery, reclaimed as much as 235 mu of wasteland per day.

The Tarim is rapidly changing its original appearance. In 1958, a total of 470,000 mu of wasteland were reclaimed on both banks of the upper reaches of the Tarim River, and three main canal projects with a total length of more than 150 kilometers and a water conveyance capacity of 88.9 cubic meters per second were completed. According to the principle of "building farms diligently and thriftily," "reclaiming wasteland, producing, building, accumulating, and expanding at the same time," seven large state-owned farms and an agricultural university were built on the vast newly reclaimed land. In order to adapt to the leap-forward development of the Tarim, a wide and flat Aksu-Aral highway with a length of 135 kilometers and the first north-south bridge across the Tarim River with a length of 325 meters were also built in the desert covered with thorns. On the north bank of this bridge, a new town of Aral has also appeared. At present, new houses are being built batch after batch in this emerging town, and tall buildings are also being built. The newly established tractor repair and assembly plant has begun to produce locomotive parts and repair locomotives that have broken down. The Tarim Agricultural University and the farm's children's schools have also started classes here, and a hospital with a capacity of 400 beds is also under intense construction. Seeing people's ideals become reality and the desert turn into an oasis in the hands of soldiers, who can fail to be encouraged and excited by these? The changes in the leaping Tarim are indeed very amazing. Commander Tao Zhiyue of the Production Corps has a poem of climbing the building, which outlines this rapid change:

There are tall buildings by the Tarim River,
Today, I climb up to take it all in at a glance.
The scenery is completely different in just a few days,
The boundless desert is full of fields.

In 1958, we used the land reclaimed that year to plant some cotton, grain, and vegetables, and obtained a bumper harvest. Through these production practices, it has been proven that the conditions for growing grain and cotton crops on both banks of the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River are good. A Soviet friend said after visiting the Tarim: "The Tarim River is the Nile River of China." Yes, our Tarim River is not only like the ancient African Nile River, but will greatly surpass the Nile River. We must build it more beautiful than the Nile River and build it into the best cotton and grain base in our motherland. The underground resources in the Tarim region are also quite abundant, with large reserves of oil, which may become a petroleum industry base. The future of the Tarim is very broad.

Of course, the current construction work is only the beginning, and it has only just opened the prelude to a serious battle to develop the Tarim. To build the Tarim well, to make it hand over huge amounts of cotton and grain to the country every year, much more construction work will be needed in the future. Such as building reservoirs, using water rationally, improving soil, stabilizing riverbeds, comprehensively greening, especially building economic forest belts on a large scale, and truly building the Tarim into a Jiangnan outside the Great Wall in the west of the motherland, requires us to continue to work hard, skillfully, and make great efforts. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the iron-willed soldiers who participated in the Nanniwan production will surely realize their promise.

At present, spring is just beginning on both banks of the Tarim River, and a tense large-scale spring plowing and sowing is underway. The land reclaimed by the soldiers last year is being sown again in the early season. The soldiers want to produce mountains and seas of grain and cotton for the motherland!

　　向塔里木索取粮棉
　　中国人民解放军新疆农业建设第一师师长　林海清
    塔里木河是我国西部地区最大的一条内陆河流，由于河流的不断沉积，在塔里木河上中游造成了一个广大的冲积平原。它位于南疆盆地的北部边缘，西越阿克苏河和业尔羌河的交会点，东抵尉犁县境兵的群克。根据确实的调查，塔里木河上中游两岸有可耕土地一千六百万亩，其中稍加改良即可利用的土地约达六百万亩。水土资源是相当丰富的。而且气候温和，年平均温度为摄氏十度，绝对无霜期长达一百八十五天，平均无霜期为二百四十五天，非常适合种植各种棉花和各种粮食作物，是开辟祖国西北部棉粮仓库的理想基地。
    多少年来，塔里木河总是悠闲、任性的流着。据资料记载，从来谁也不敢近它，谁也不能了解它。维吾尔人民称它为一匹“无羁之马”，从语意上可以看出，我们的前人对于古老的塔里木河认为是神奇莫测的。事实也是这样：那里荒林漠土，无边无际，干旱风沙，飞禽走兽。在过去黑暗时代里，罪恶的反动统治者是不能对塔里木河有所作为的。因而这匹“无羁之马”只能等待着英雄的骑手。
    红旗飘处，旗手来了。奉毛主席命令进驻新疆的中国人民解放军生产部队，自进入新疆第一天起，就遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，一手拿枪，一手拿坎土镘（生产工具），担负起了保卫祖国、建设祖国的双重革命任务。艰苦奋斗，向地球开战，为祖国和边疆各族人民创造了巨量的财富。因此，坚决制服塔里木，勇敢跨上这匹神奇的无羁之马的光辉任务，也就落在我们生产战士的肩上了。
    解放军新疆农业建设第一师这支英雄部队，其前身就是铁打的三五九旅，南征北战，奋勇前进，为祖国人民立下了不朽的功劳。战争年代的南泥湾大生产运动，更是誉满中外。进驻新疆后，为了各族人民的经济文化建设事业的发展和繁荣，他们一直坚持在南疆地区，进行大规模的生产活动，同大自然搏斗，向大自然索取财富。九年来，共开垦荒地一百余万亩，收获了大量粮食和棉花，培养了干部，取得了经验，为大规模的开发塔里木河，奠定了有力的基础。
    正式开发塔里木河的上中游，是从1957年11月开始的。中央农垦部、中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会、中共新疆生产建设兵团委员会，对于塔里木河流域的开发，都非常重视。开发工作开始后，从中央到地方，又都给予了大力支持，因而在自古荒凉的塔里木河两岸，便迅速地展开了紧张的向自然开战的局面。根据规划，我们要在塔里木河的上中游，用最快的速度开垦出一千万亩土地，然后紧接着就要开发美丽的叶尔羌河流域。
    我们部队在严冬季节进入塔里木，随即开始了北岸大渠的水利工程及开荒造田工作。由于交通艰难，地处荒僻，当时的开发工作是非常困难的。部队生活条件也非常艰苦。搭帐蓬，挖地窝子，饮食也不好，所有这些都没有难倒战士。战士们个个干劲冲天，战胜风沙严寒，披荆斩棘，要在万古荒原的塔里木两岸建设起自己的绿色家园。
    党的社会主义建设总路线的提出，和全国全面大跃进形势的鼓舞，更给我们开发塔里木增加了新的巨大力量。战士们把英勇顽强、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统和敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格结合起来了。这样便迅速地开展了轰轰烈烈的以技术革新为中心的开荒大竞赛运动，各单位大搞机械化开荒的结果，大大加快了塔里木的建设速度。如胜利十六场1958年全年每人平均开荒达一百三十六亩，超出了师党委号召的个人开荒一百亩的指标。有的人在少量的机械配合下，日开荒竟达二百三十五亩。
    塔里木迅速的改变着自己的原始面貌。1958年在塔里木河上游两岸共开垦了荒地四十七万亩，并完成了长一百五十余公里、输水能力为八十八点九秒公方的三条干渠工程。根据“勤俭建场”、“边开荒、边生产、边建设、边积累、边扩大”的方针，在广阔的新垦土地上，共建起了七个大型国营农场和一个农业大学。为适应塔里木的飞跃发展，同时还在荆棘遍地的荒漠上，修建了一条长达一百三十五公里的宽阔平坦的阿克苏—阿拉尔公路，以及长达三百二十五公尺、横跨塔里木河的第一座南北大桥。在这座大桥的北岸，还出现了一座阿拉尔新市镇，目前，在这个新兴的市镇里，崭新的房屋一批又一批地盖起来了，高楼大厦也盖起来了，新建立的拖拉机修配厂，已开始生产机车零件和医治着出了毛病的机车。塔里木农业大学和农场的子弟学校，也都在这里开学上课，能容纳四百张病床的一个医院，也正在紧张施工。眼看着人们的理想变成了现实，荒漠在战士手下变成了绿洲，谁能不为这些欢欣鼓舞呢？跃进中的塔里木的变化，的确是十分惊人的。生产兵团陶峙岳司令员有登楼诗一首，划出了这个急遽的变化：
    塔里木河边有高楼，
    今日登临一榄收。
    景物全非曾几日，
    无边漠野尽田畴。
    1958年我们利用当年开荒的土地，还种植了部分棉花、粮食和蔬菜，并获得了丰收。通过这些生产的实践，证明塔里木河上中游两岸种植粮棉作物的情况是良好的。一位苏联朋友参观了塔里木之后说：“塔里木河是中国的尼罗河”。是的，我们的塔里木河不仅像古老的非洲尼罗河，而且会大大的超过尼罗河。我们一定要把它建设得比尼罗河更美丽，建设成我们祖国的一个最好的棉粮基地。塔里木地区的地下资源也相当丰富，蕴藏有大量石油，有可能成为石油工业基地。塔里木的前途是很广阔的。
    当然，目前的建设工作，还只是开始，还只是刚刚揭开了开发塔里木的一场严重战斗的序幕。要把塔里木建设得很好，要叫它每年都向国家缴出巨量的棉花和粮食，今后还需做很多很大的建设工作。如修建水库，合理用水，改良土壤，稳定河床，全面绿化，特别是大搞经济林带，把塔里木真正建设成为一个祖国西边的塞外江南，是需要我们继续大干、巧干和付出巨大努力的。我们坚信，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，参加过南泥湾生产的钢铁战士，一定会实现自己的诺言。
    目前，塔里木河两岸春意初浓，紧张的大规模的春耕春播正在进行。去年战士开出的土地，今年又在赶早季节播种，战士们要为祖国生产出如山如海的粮食和棉花！
