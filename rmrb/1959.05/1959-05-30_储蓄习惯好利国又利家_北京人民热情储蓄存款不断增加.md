Xinhua News Agency, May 29th. The people of Beijing are continuously increasing their deposits in banks. According to statistics from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, as of May 20th, the city's total savings deposits reached 244,240,000 yuan, an increase of more than 19,980,000 yuan compared to the end of last year.

Urban and rural working people are the basic savers in the banks. They live diligently and thriftily, saving the surplus money from their daily lives. Shen Lingqin, a worker's family member in Donghuashi, Chongwen District, has a monthly income of more than 100 yuan for a family of six. After buying coal, rice, oil, salt, and other necessary living supplies each month, she deposits the remaining money in the bank. She now has 250 yuan in fixed deposits. Shen Lingqin said that regular deposits not only prevent waste but also allow temporarily unused money to be used by the state for regulation, supporting the country's socialist construction. Wang Huarong, a worker's family member in Nanchizi, Dongcheng District, does not have a small income, but before participating in savings, the money was often spent casually when it was in hand. More than two years ago, she changed this way of managing the household, saving 15 yuan per month in the bank as a fixed deposit, and keeping the rest as a current deposit, also in the bank, to be withdrawn whenever needed. Her family now has more than 200 yuan in savings. Duan Shufang, a resident of Jiaodaokou, has a monthly income of more than 220 yuan, and although the money is sufficient, she never spends it extravagantly. In order to save expenses, one of the family rules they have established is to deposit the remaining money in the bank. Now her family has monthly savings.

The number of farmers in suburban (counties) who deposit money is also increasing. As of May 10th, the balance of farmers' deposits reached 5.4 million yuan, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared to the end of April.

    储蓄习惯好利国又利家
    北京人民热情储蓄存款不断增加
    新华社29日讯　北京市人民在银行存款不断增加。据中国人民银行北京分行统计，截止5月20日，全市人民储蓄存款达到两亿四千四百二十四万元，比去年年底增加一千九百九十八万多元。
    城乡劳动人民是银行的基本储户，他们克勤克俭地过日子，把日常节省下来的余钱储存起来。崇文区东花市职工家属沈玲琴一家六口人，每月收入一百多元。每个月，她把煤米油盐和其他必要的生活用品买齐以后，就把余款存到银行里去，现在她已有二百五十元的定期存款。沈玲琴说，这样经常存款，不但能防止浪费，而且可以把暂时不用的钱供国家调剂使用，支援了国家的社会主义建设。东城区南池子职工家属王华荣一家收入不算少，但是在没有参加储蓄以前，钱在手头，常常顺手花掉。两年多以前，她改变了这种治家方法，每月储蓄十五元在银行作为定期存款，其余的作为活期，也存在银行，什么时候用什么时候取。现在她家已有二百多元存款。交道口居民段淑芳一家每月收入二百二十多元，虽然钱够用，但是她从不大手大脚乱花钱。为了节约开支，她们制定的家庭公约中有一条就是把剩余的钱存在银行里，现在她家月月有存款。
    郊区（县）农民存款的人也不断增多。到5月10日，农民的存款余额达到五百四十万元，比4月底增加十万多元。
