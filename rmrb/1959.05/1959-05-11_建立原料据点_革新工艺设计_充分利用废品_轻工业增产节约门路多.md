Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: Workers in the national light industry departments are adopting various measures to increase the sources of raw materials in many ways and promote the increased production of light industrial products in the increase production and conservation campaign.

Many light industrial enterprises, according to their own conditions, are using indigenous methods or a combination of foreign and indigenous methods to produce the raw materials they need. After more than three months of hard work, the workers of the Shanghai Huafeng Paper Mill used scrap steel, stone, cement, and wood to build an acid-alkali plant on a barren land, which can produce 2,000 tons of soda ash, 310 tons of carbon disulfide, and 1.5 tons of sulfuric acid per day for the paper mill's use. There are now quite a few paper mills that produce their own acid and alkali in this way. Some enterprises have established raw material production bases in contact with relevant departments or people's communes. The Shanghai paper industry is linked to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai suburban areas to establish 87 raw material supply bases, which are expected to obtain more than 10,000 tons of grass pulp and other raw materials per month. Many breweries and canneries in Liaoning Province are linked to people's communes to establish raw material production bases, increasing the production of barley for beer, various fruits for fruit wine, and meat for canned food.

Many light industrial industries have adopted methods such as innovating technology, improving product design, and adjusting formulas to save a lot of raw materials. The daily-use metal products industry uses precision casting to cast some parts, eliminating processing losses and saving a lot of metal materials. For example, the Qingdao Bicycle Factory precisely casts eleven parts on bicycles, and the steel saved in one year can be used to manufacture 15,000 bicycles. The Tianjin Leather Factory innovated its technology and added a "stretching board" process, which allowed each cowhide to produce two more square meters of leather. The factory originally had difficulty completing its plan due to insufficient raw materials, but now it is confident of overfulfilling its plan. After the rubber shoe industry generally adopted sponge soles, carbon black soles, and microporous soles, the raw rubber saved in one year can increase the production of more than 10 million pairs of rubber shoes.

All localities and industries have also put forward the slogan of "turning waste into gold, turning useless into useful, and turning less use into more use," sending people out to find substitutes, organizing waste recycling, and tapping the potential of local resources to "raise grain" for light industrial production. More than 30 kinds of grass fibers that can be used to make paper pulp and 31 kinds of substitutes that can be used to make wine have now been found. It has become quite common for the glass industry to replace soda ash with mirabilite, the leather-making industry to promote pigskin leather making, and the paper-making industry to replace copper mesh with bamboo curtains. Many paper mills also use waste account books and vouchers sorted out by the People's Bank of China, remittance slips sorted out by the postal and telecommunications bureaus, and waste magazines as pulp. The Shanghai Paper Company adopted this method. Although the supply of wood pulp, reed pulp, and bamboo pulp in the first quarter was much lower than the same period last year, the output of paper increased by 27.5% compared with the same period last year. In the past, miscellaneous wood, miscellaneous bamboo, rags, hemp rope ends, waste rubber, waste plastics, and scrap copper and iron were all regarded as waste materials, but now they are all recycled as light industrial raw materials. Some factories also turned over their warehouses and cleared dead corners, making use of all available materials.

Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard," all localities, industries, and enterprises are vigorously carrying out collaboration, comprehensively utilizing raw materials, and exchanging what they have for what they need, and regulating surpluses and shortages. For example, sugar factories in many regions supply sugarcane dregs after sugar extraction to paper mills for making pulp and to wineries for making alcohol. Light industrial departments in many regions have signed raw material product ordering agreements with commercial departments, and commercial departments assist in purchasing and allocating raw materials.

### 建立原料据点  革新工艺设计　充分利用废品  轻工业增产节约门路多

    建立原料据点  革新工艺设计　充分利用废品
    轻工业增产节约门路多
    新华社10日讯　全国轻工业部门的职工，在增产节约运动中，采取各种措施多方增加原料和材料的来源，促进轻工业品增产。
    许多轻工业企业根据本身条件，用土法上马或洋土结合的办法，生产自己所需要的原料材料。上海华丰造纸厂职工经过三个多月的辛勤劳动，用废旧钢铁材料、石料、水泥和木材等，在一块荒地上建起一座酸碱厂，可以年产二千吨纯碱、三百一十吨二硫化碳、日产一吨半硫酸，供本厂造纸用。像这样自己搞酸碱生产的造纸厂，现在已经不在少数。有的企业与有关部门或人民公社联系，建立了原料生产基地。上海造纸工业同浙江、江苏及上海市郊区挂钩，建立八十七个原料供应据点，预计每月可以得到草浆等原料一万余吨。辽宁省许多酿酒厂、罐头厂和人民公社联系，建立原料生产基地，增产造啤酒用的大麦，造果酒用的各种水果和造罐头用的肉类。
    许多轻工业行业采用革新工艺、改进产品设计、调整配方等方法，节约了大量原料材料。日用金属制品工业用精密铸造的方法铸造部分零件，免除了加工损耗，能节省大量金属材料。如青岛自行车厂，精密铸造自行车上的十一种零件，一年节约下来的钢材可以制造自行车一万五千辆。天津制革厂革新工艺，增加了“绷板”工序，使每张牛皮能多出二平方公尺皮革。这个厂原来因为原料不足，完成计划有困难，现在有把握超额完成计划了。胶鞋工业普遍采用海绵底、炭黑大底、微孔大底以后，一年节约的生胶能增产一千余万双胶鞋。
    各地各行业还提出“变废物为黄金，化无用为有用，化少用为多用”的口号，派人四出寻找代用品，组织废品回收，挖掘地方资源潜力，为轻工业生产“筹粮”。现在已经寻找到可以制纸浆的草类纤维三十多种，可以制酒的代用品三十一种。玻璃工业以芒硝代替纯碱，制革工业推广猪皮制革，造纸工业以竹帘代替铜网，已经相当普遍。许多造纸厂还利用人民银行整理出来的废旧帐册、单据，邮电局整理出的汇票存根以及废旧杂志等作纸浆。上海造纸公司采取这种办法，一季度虽然木浆、苇浆、竹浆的供应量比去年同期减少很多，但是纸张产量却比去年同期增长了27.5％。过去一向当作废料的杂木、杂竹、破布、麻绳头、废橡胶、废塑料、破铜烂铁等，现在都回收起来作为轻工业原料。有的工厂还翻仓倒库，清理死角，把凡是能够利用的物资都利用起来。
    在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，各地、各行业、各企业大搞协作，综合利用原料，并且互通有无，调剂余缺。如许多地区的糖厂把榨糖后的蔗渣供造纸厂制纸浆，供酒厂制酒精。不少地区的轻工业部门与商业部门签订了原料产品订货协议书，由商业部门协助收购和调配原料。
