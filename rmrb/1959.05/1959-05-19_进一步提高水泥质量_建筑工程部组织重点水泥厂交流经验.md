Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Many key cement plants across the country, while vigorously increasing cement production, have improved product quality. This is a major achievement in the quality and high-yield competition movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution on the construction materials production front. In April of this year, national cement production increased by 21.1% compared to the same period last year, and more than a dozen key enterprises have steadily increased their product qualification rates while maintaining high production.

From January to April, Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant overfulfilled its production quotas every month, and the cement it produced was generally higher than the national standards. Huaxin Cement Plant has consistently produced cement that is 100% qualified for a long time.

One of the important reasons why more than a dozen key cement plants have been able to improve product quality is that leading cadres personally take action, frequently go deep into the field, and promptly discover and solve quality-related problems. For example, in order to solve the quality problem of limestone, the Party Committee of Datong Cement Plant, leading cadres went deep into the mines to understand the situation and, together with the workers, quickly researched a solution, creating favorable conditions for ensuring cement quality. In early January this year, with the help of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, leading cadres and technical personnel of Qingdao Cement Plant went deep into the workshops, mobilized the workers, and conducted more than ten days of inspection and research. After formulating a series of measures and management systems, all of the more than 6,000 tons of cement produced from January to April this year met the standards.

Strengthening employee education and establishing an atmosphere where everyone values quality and strictly abides by technical operating procedures is an important guarantee for these key enterprises to improve product quality. For example, Tangshan Cement Plant, in view of the large number of new workers, low technical level, and poor labor discipline, repeatedly conducted education among the masses on abiding by operating procedures and ensuring quality, and mobilized veteran workers and technical personnel to use their spare time to explain operating procedures to new workers. This not only strengthened the new workers' discipline in strictly abiding by operating procedures, but also improved product quality.

Strengthening technical management and establishing necessary inspection systems are important measures for these key enterprises to ensure quality.

In order to further improve the quality of cement, the Ministry of Construction Engineering recently held a telephone conference to organize key cement plants across the country to exchange experiences in improving product quality and to further carry out the red flag competition centered on high quality and high yield.

    进一步提高水泥质量
    建筑工程部组织重点水泥厂交流经验
    据新华社17日讯　全国许多重点水泥厂在大力增产水泥的同时，提高了产品质量，这是建筑材料生产战线上开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的优质高产竞赛运动的重大成果。今年4月份全国水泥产量比去年同期提高21.1％，有十多个重点企业在保持高产的情况下，产品合格率在稳步上升。
    北京琉璃河水泥厂1月至4月份，月月超产，出厂水泥一般都高于国家规定的标准。华新水泥厂长期以来出厂水泥全部合格。
    十多个重点水泥厂能够提高产品质量的重要原因之一，就是领导干部亲自动手，经常深入现场，及时发现和解决了有关质量的问题。如大同水泥厂党委为了解决石灰石的质量问题，领导干部深入矿山，了解情况，和工人一起很快研究出了解决办法，为保证水泥质量创造了有利条件。青岛水泥厂今年1月上旬，在山东省建筑工程局的帮助下，领导干部和技术人员深入车间，发动工人，进行了十多天的检查研究，制定出一系列的措施和管理制度以后，今年1至4月份生产的六千多吨水泥，全部合乎标准。
    加强职工教育，树立起人人重视质量和严格遵守技术规程的风气，是这些重点企业提高产品质量的重要保证。如唐山水泥厂针对新工人多，技术水平低，劳动纪律性差的情况，在群众中反复地进行了遵守操作规程、保证质量的教育，并且发动老工人、技术人员利用业余时间，给新工人讲解操作规程。这样，既加强了新工人严守操作规程的纪律性，又提高了产品的质量。
    加强技术管理，建立必要的检验制度，是这些重点企业保证质量的一项重要措施。
    为了进一步提高水泥的质量，建筑工程部最近召开了一次电话会议，组织全国重点水泥厂交流提高产品质量的经验，并进一步深入开展以优质高产为中心的红旗竞赛。（附图片）
