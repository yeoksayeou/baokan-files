Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 8th: Prime Minister Castro returned to Havana today after visiting the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, and was warmly welcomed by approximately 100,000 people.

    Castro spoke to the welcoming crowd in the Civic Square. He said that he went abroad to defend the revolution and oppose slander and lies, because any just cause has enemies, but it has more friends than enemies. He pointed out, "The enemies of the revolution hope that we will make mistakes and try everything possible to oppose our revolution. But we have gained the support of public opinion throughout the continent." Castro said that the Cuban revolution will continue to advance, and no one can stop it. The crowd listening to his speech interrupted him with cheers, shouting: "Unite! Unite!"

    Castro went to the United States for a visit on April 16 at the invitation of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. On the day he began his visit, he announced that the purpose of the visit was "to establish good relations, promote understanding, and establish good economic relations."

    According to Western newspapers, U.S. officials, in their contacts and talks with Castro, attempted to make him abandon his nationalist stance and succumb to U.S. policy, demanding that the Cuban government "must encourage a 'better atmosphere' conducive to" investment by American monopoly capital.

    Castro later emphasized at a reception at the American Press Club that he did not visit the United States to "beg," and Cuba would never "sell its soul" to obtain American "aid."

    卡斯特罗访问南北美洲后返国说
    古巴革命将继续前进
    据新华社哈瓦那8日电　卡斯特罗总理在访问美国、加拿大、阿根廷、巴西和乌拉圭之后今天回到哈瓦那，受到约十万人的热情欢迎。
    卡斯特罗在西维卡广场上向欢迎的群众讲了话。他说，他到外国去是为了保卫革命，反对诬蔑和谎言，因为任何正义事业都有敌人，但是它的朋友比敌人更多。他指出，“革命的敌人希望我们犯错误，并千方百计地反对我们的革命。但是我们已经得到整个大陆舆论的支持。”卡斯特罗说，古巴革命将继续前进，任何人都阻止不了它的前进。听他演讲的群众以欢呼声打断他的话，高呼：“团结起来！团结！”
    卡斯特罗是应美国报纸编辑协会的邀请在4月16日前往美国访问的。他在开始访问的当天曾宣布，这次访问的目的是“为了建立良好的关系、促进了解和建立良好的经济关系”。
    据西方报纸报道，美国官方人士在跟卡斯特罗的接触和会谈中，曾经企图使他放弃民族主义的立场，屈从于美国的政策，要求古巴政府“必须鼓励一种有利于”美国垄断资本投资的“比较好的气氛”。
    卡斯特罗后来在美国新闻俱乐部的欢迎会上曾经强调指出，他访问美国不是为了“乞求”，古巴决不为了取得美国“援助”而“出卖自己的灵魂”。
