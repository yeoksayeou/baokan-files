Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　At this meeting of the Great Leap Forward and Great Unity, after listening to Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the reports of other national leaders, I feel extremely happy and inspired, and express my complete support.

　　The 1959 National Economic Leap Forward Plan is a magnificent plan for the continued Great Leap Forward of the national economy, and it is achievable. I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the glorious illumination of the general line of socialism, and on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, as long as we continue to put politics in command, unite closely, resolutely implement the policies and guidelines decided by the Party, continue to exert all our energy, promote the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, mobilize all positive factors, tap the potential of all aspects, and launch a production increase and economy drive centered on the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, we will definitely be able to complete and overfulfill the 1959 National Economic Plan.
Our Achievements in Foreign Relations
　　The progress our country has made in foreign relations is exciting. There are now thirty-three countries that have established diplomatic or semi-diplomatic relations with our country, ninety-three countries and regions that have established economic relations with our country, and one hundred and four countries and regions that have established cultural ties and friendly exchanges with our country. More importantly, our country has made tremendous efforts for the cause of world peace. In the struggle to defend world peace and enhance the friendly relations between the people of all countries, our friends are all over the world. The imperialists' attempt to isolate New China is futile. We do not crave the recognition of any imperialists, but we cherish the ever-growing friendship with the people of all countries. The progress of our country's foreign relations shows that the peaceful diplomatic policy consistently pursued by our country and the brotherly countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is correct and successful, and it is making a great contribution to safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress.

　　Our achievements in foreign relations are a victory for peace. This achievement is inseparable from the joint efforts of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union for peace. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that consolidating solidarity with the Soviet Union and consolidating solidarity with all socialist countries is our country's fundamental policy, and expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries for their great assistance to our country. This fully expresses the common will and heartfelt feelings of the Chinese people. Every patriotic Chinese person must resolutely support this great policy, closely integrate patriotism with proletarian internationalism under the leadership of the Party and the state, and work tirelessly to consolidate and develop the solidarity between China and the Soviet Union and the solidarity of the entire socialist camp. This great unity is a steel fortress most hated by imperialism headed by the United States and all reactionaries, but it can never be broken through. At the same time, it is the most reliable guarantee for the cause of peace, progress, and happiness of mankind. It is of utmost importance to unite more people around the world around this great fortress and move forward hand in hand.

　　Premier Zhou emphatically expounded in his report our country's consistent policy of sympathy and support for nationally independent countries and national independence movements. This is a powerful encouragement for us and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to support each other in the just struggle against imperialism, colonialism, aggression, and intervention, and to strive for common victory. The countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are reliable friends of all people in the world who are fighting for and safeguarding national independence. They always stand firmly on their side and give them sympathy and support. Facts have proved that the sympathy and support of the socialist forces for the national independence movement has greatly facilitated the development and victory of the national independence movement. Since the emergence of the powerful socialist camp in the world, the struggles of all oppressed nations have had a backing, and the development of the national independence movement has formed an irresistible historical trend. Therefore, only by adhering to solidarity with socialist countries, resolutely relying on the masses of the people, and thoroughly carrying out the anti-imperialist struggle can we achieve the victory of the national independence movement. China was not long ago a semi-colony that suffered greatly from imperialist aggression. Now, our country's territory of Taiwan is still occupied by the forces of American imperialism. Taiwan must be liberated. Any attempt to divide China's territory and create "two Chinas" is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people and is doomed to failure. We always share weal and woe with all countries and people striving for national independence in the anti-imperialist struggle. Therefore, it is only natural that the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported all national liberation movements in the world, and it can never be shaken by the imperialists' attempts to sow discord, spread rumors, and slander.

　　Our country's peaceful and friendly policy is fully embodied in its relations with Asian and African countries. As Premier Zhou pointed out, our country is developing good diplomatic relations with many nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa, establishing and developing economic and cultural ties, and expanding friendly exchanges. This is not only because we share a common desire for peace and friendship with Asian and African countries, but also because we adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and actively promote the Bandung Spirit. However, our efforts are detrimental to the imperialists' policies of aggression and war. Therefore, the imperialists headed by the United States and the Yugoslav revisionist group that has taken refuge in imperialism hate our country's friendly relations with nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa, and are determined to undermine them. They sow discord and commit all kinds of evil. They have even fabricated the slander that China's strength is a "threat" to its Southeast Asian neighbors. The fact is that the Chinese people have always loved peace, and China's development will not only never threaten anyone, but as our country's peaceful construction achieves victory, we will become even more friendly with all countries that are willing to develop peaceful and friendly relations with us. Premier Zhou said very clearly: "Our country has never invaded the territory of any neighboring country, nor has it interfered in the internal affairs of any neighboring country, and it will always be the same in the future." He also pointed out: "Our country has always strictly guarded its borders and patiently waited for our friendly neighbor, the Burmese government, to handle the Kuomintang remnants who fled to Burma and have been constantly harassing our border and threatening our security for ten years, even under these circumstances." Could a country that does not love peace do this? In the face of ironclad facts, the imperialists' shameless lies that China "threatens" other countries are self-defeating and not worth refuting.

　　In Asia, as in other parts of the world, the threat to the people of all countries comes from the common enemy of mankind—imperialism. "The imperialist colonial forces are trying to maintain or restore control over newly independent countries. In addition to direct military threats and armed suppression, they are also piecing together military blocs, concluding military treaties, establishing military bases, intensifying economic aggression, plotting military coups, and organizing subversive activities." This is already a well-known fact. The purpose of the imperialists' wanton slander of China and their attempts to sow discord between Asian nationally independent countries is to undermine our solidarity so that they can carry out the policy of defeating these nationally independent countries one by one, dividing them, and ruling them, thereby restoring their colonial rule in Asia. In today's situation where the people of Asia have awakened, the imperialists' conspiracies are doomed to failure; but it is also worth noting that the authorities of a few countries, against the will of the people, have thrown themselves into the arms of imperialism, acting as accomplices for the paper tiger, and bringing disaster to the people of their countries.

　　In his report, Premier Zhou expressed our country's willingness to establish and develop friendly and good-neighborly relations with all neighboring countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and advocated the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and collective security systems in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific region. Our country and many Southeast Asian countries that are adjacent to or close to each other have common interests and no disputes that cannot be resolved peacefully. In fact, a zone of peace has already been formed in Asia. If it can be made permanent and expanded to the entire Asia-Pacific region, it is completely in line with the fundamental interests of the people of all countries in this vast region. This proposal is a call of great significance issued by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries to maintain peace. It is a powerful blow to the imperialists' aggressive ambitions and war policies, a test for some foreign figures who are insincere, and a huge support for the forces of world peace. I believe that the peace-loving people of all countries will support this proposal and work to realize it.
Those Who Interfere in Our Internal Affairs Are Bound to Fail
　　The closer imperialism and all reactionaries get to their demise, the more they will make a dying struggle, showing desperate madness. Recently, imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries colluded and instigated the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet to launch an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and the nation. I feel extremely angry about this. The rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion once again vividly proved that imperialism and reactionaries are paper tigers who are unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history, brandishing their teeth and claws, and bringing destruction upon themselves. The victory in suppressing the rebellion has made the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of the nation even more consolidated, enabled the Tibetan people to embark on a new life of democracy and moving towards the great road of socialism, and shattered the conspiracies and fantasies of imperialists and foreign reactionary elements. But what is infuriating and regrettable is that a group of interventionist elements have appeared in the neighboring country of India. Of course, they cannot represent the Indian people, but they violate the Five Principles and the Bandung Spirit, interfere in our internal affairs, support the Tibetan rebellion, covet our country's territory of Tibet, and are no different from the imperialists. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Kalimpong has long been a base for Tibetan reactionary elements to carry out treasonous activities abroad. Now, certain Indian ambitious people are still taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble against the friendly country of China, and their actions are becoming more and more excessive. Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory. This is an undeniable fact to anyone. The Indian interventionist elements dare to inherit the mantle of British imperialism, plotting to create so-called "Tibetan independence" in order to separate Tibet from China and place it under foreign control. In order to cover up their unspeakable activities, deceive the people, evade condemnation, and continue to interfere in China's internal affairs, Indian diplomats even distributed the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." This absurd document, full of lies and loopholes, which was obviously imposed on the Dalai Lama, has been solemnly refuted and unanimously opposed by the Tibetan people, Buddhist leaders, and fair-minded people all over the world, and its true colors have been exposed. However, the ambitious people in India are still using the name of the Dalai Lama to engage in sophistry, showing that their ambitions have not died. These foreign schemers have obviously forgotten that the Chinese people are no longer weak and easily bullied. The Chinese people have always adhered to the Five Principles and cherish Sino-Indian friendship, but they will never allow foreign reactionaries to interfere in our internal affairs, undermine our national unity, and divide our territory. The days of imperialism running rampant are gone forever. Anyone who wants to follow in the footsteps of British imperialism and provoke New China is destined to fail completely. The Indian ambitious people's conspiracy against China has already aroused strong condemnation and opposition from all sides. Recently, fair-minded public opinion in India has also repeatedly pointed out that using the Tibetan rebellion to plot against Chinese territory is acting as an agent of imperialism, and the result will only be to damage India's interests. Such sincere words are worth remembering by Indian interventionists. Recognizing the situation, changing their minds, quickly stopping all conspiratorial activities to interfere in China's internal affairs, returning to the Five Principles, respecting Sino-Indian friendship, and turning the spearhead against the common enemy of world peace—imperialism—that is where India's true interests lie, and it is also the sincere hope of peace-loving and friendly people for India.

　　Today, people are already living in a brand-new era—the great era of "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind." Socialism is surging in the world with the force of an avalanche and the power of thunder. The construction of countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is developing rapidly, and the international communist ranks are closely united and becoming increasingly strong. The national revolutionary movement of the oppressed nations of the world is surging forward, and the disintegration of the colonial system has caused imperialism to lose its past warehouses and rears. The imperialist countries have fallen into serious economic and political crises, and there are more and more disputes among the aggressive blocs, which are heading towards disintegration. Imperialism is decadent and declining, and the forces of peace are unprecedentedly strong and have the power to stop imperialist war provocations. "The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day." Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, while carrying out the Great Leap Forward at home, are working together with the Soviet Union and other socialist brotherly countries, as well as all peace-loving people in the world, to defend the cause of world peace and human progress with even more confidence, moving from victory to victory.

### 希望印度朋友尊重中印友谊  程希孟委员的发言

　　希望印度朋友尊重中印友谊
    程希孟委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    在这个大跃进、大团结的会上，听了周总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和其他的国家领导人的报告，我感到无比的欢欣鼓舞，表示完全拥护。
    一九五九年的国民经济跃进计划是一个能够实现的国民经济继续大跃进的宏伟计划。我坚决相信在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，只要我们继续政治挂帅，紧密团结起来，坚决贯彻执行党所决定的方针政策，继续鼓足干劲，发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神，调动一切积极因素，发挥各方面的潜力，开展一个以技术革命、文化革命为中心的增产节约运动，就一定能完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划。我国对外关系上的成就
    我国在对外关系方面所取得的进展是令人兴奋的。现在同我国建交和半建交的国家已有三十三个，同我国建立经济关系的国家和地区有九十三个，建立文化联系和进行友好往来的国家和地区已达一百零四个。更重要的是我国对世界和平的事业作了巨大努力，在保卫世界和平、增进各国人民的友好关系的斗争中，我们的朋友是遍于天下。帝国主义妄想孤立新中国的企图是无济于事的。我们并不希罕什么帝国主义对我国的承认，但非常珍视同各国人民日益发展的友谊，我国对外关系的进展说明了我国和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营兄弟国家所一致奉行的和平外交政策是正确的，成功的，对于保卫世界和平，促进人类进步是有巨大贡献的。
    我国对外关系上的成就是和平的胜利。这种成就是和以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营对和平的共同努力分不开的。周总理在报告中指出了巩固同苏联的团结、巩固同所有社会主义国家的团结是我国的根本方针，并向苏联和其他兄弟国家给我国的巨大援助表示深切感谢。这完全表达了我国人民的共同意志和衷情。每一个爱国的中国人都要坚决拥护这一伟大方针，在党和国家的领导下把爱国主义和无产阶级的国际主义密切结合起来，为巩固和发展中苏团结和整个社会主义阵营的团结而不懈地努力。这个伟大的团结是以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派所最仇视但永远冲不破的钢铁堡垒，同时也是人类和平事业和进步、幸福的最可靠保证，把全世界更多的人民团结在这伟大堡垒的周围，携手前进，是有极重要的意义的。
    周总理在报告中着重阐明了我国一贯坚持对民族独立国家和民族独立运动的同情和支持的方针。这对于我们和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民在反帝国主义、反殖民主义、反侵略、反干涉的正义斗争中相互支援，争取共同胜利是一个有力的鼓舞。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家是世界上一切争取和维护民族独立的人民的可靠朋友，始终坚决站在他们一边，并予以同情和支援。事实证明，社会主义力量对于民族独立运动的同情和支持，大大便利了民族独立运动的发展和胜利。自从世界上出现了强大的社会主义阵营，一切被压迫民族的斗争才有了靠山，民族独立运动的发展才形成了不可抗拒的历史潮流。因此，只有坚持同社会主义国家的团结，坚决依靠人民群众，彻底进行反帝斗争，才是民族独立运动的胜利道路。中国不久以前还是一个饱受帝国主义侵略的半殖民地，现在我国的领土台湾还在美帝国主义的势力侵占之下，台湾是一定要解放的，任何企图割裂中国领土，制造“两个中国”，都是中国人民绝对不能容许的，注定要失败的。我们同一切争取民族独立的国家和人民在反帝斗争中总是休戚相关、甘苦与共的。因此，中国人民一向同情、支持世界上一切民族解放运动，是很自然的，也决非帝国主义的挑拨离间、造谣中伤所能动摇的。
    我国的和平友好政策充分体现在对亚非国家的关系中。正如周总理指出的，我国同亚非许多民族独立国家发展着良好的外交关系，建立和发展着经济和文化联系，扩大着友好往来。这不仅是因为我们同亚非各国具有和平友好的共同愿望，也因为我们坚持和平共处的五项原则，积极发挥万隆精神，但是我们这种的努力对帝国主义的侵略和战争政策是不利的，因此，以美国为首的帝国主义及投靠帝国主义的南斯拉夫修正主义集团就仇视我国同亚非民族独立国家的友好关系，必欲加以破坏而后甘心。他们挑拨离间，无恶不作。他们竟无中生有地诬蔑说，中国的强大是对东南亚邻国的“威胁”。事实是中国人民从来就是热爱和平的，中国的发展不仅决不会威胁任何人，而且随着我国进行和平建设的胜利，我们和一切愿意同我们发展和平友好关系的国家是更加友好了。周总理说得非常明确：“我国从来没有侵犯过任何邻国的领土，没有干涉过任何邻国的内政，今后也永远是这样。”他还指出：我国对于“逃窜缅甸的国民党残匪十年来不断骚扰我国边境，威胁我国安全，即使在这种情况下，我国也只是严守边防，仍然耐心地等待我国的友好邻邦缅甸政府自行处理。”不是热爱和平的国家能这样做吗？在铁的事实面前，帝国主义诬蔑中国“威胁”别国的无耻谰言是不攻自破，不值一驳的。
    在亚洲，也像在世界其他地区一样，对各国人民的威胁却是来自人类的共同敌人——帝国主义。“帝国主义殖民势力力求继续保持或者恢复对于新近获得独立的国家的控制。他们在直接进行武力威胁和武装镇压以外，还在拼凑军事集团，缔结军事条约，建立军事基地，加紧经济侵略，策动军事政变，组织颠覆活动。”这已经是尽人皆知的事实。帝国主义肆意诬蔑中国，并挑拨亚洲民族独立国之间的关系，其目的正在于破坏我们的团结，以便对这些民族独立国家实行各个击破、分而治之，从而恢复它在亚洲的殖民统治。在今天亚洲人民已经觉醒了的形势下，帝国主义这种阴谋诡计注定是要失败的；但是也有少数国家的当局违反人民的意愿，投入帝国主义的怀抱，为纸老虎作伥，给自己国家的人民带来了灾难，这也是值得警惕的。
    周总理在报告中表示我国愿意根据和平共处的五项原则，同所有邻邦建立和发展友好的睦邻关系，并主张建立欧洲的和亚洲及太平洋区域的无原子区和集体安全体系。我国同东南亚许多接壤或靠近的国家有共同的利益而没有不能和平解决的争端，事实上已经形成为亚洲的和平地区，如果把它加以持久化，并扩大到整个亚洲和太平洋区域，是完全符合于这个广大地区各国人民的根本利益的。这个建议是苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家为维护和平而发出的有重大意义的号召。它是对帝国主义的侵略野心和战争政策的一个有力打击，对一些心口不一的外国人士的一种考验，对世界和平力量的一个巨大支持，我相信各国爱好和平的人民一定会赞成这建议，并为其实现而努力。
　　干涉我国内政者必败
    帝国主义和一切反动派愈接近灭亡，就愈要作垂死的挣扎，表现绝望的疯狂。最近帝国主义者、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派勾结并策动了西藏上层反动集团发动背叛祖国、背叛民族的武装叛乱。我对此感到无比的愤怒。西藏叛乱的迅速平息又一次生动地证明了帝国主义和反动派是纸老虎，不甘退出历史舞台，张牙舞爪，自取灭亡。平乱的胜利使祖国的统一和民族的团结更加巩固了，使西藏人民开始了一个民主的走向社会主义大道的新生，使帝国主义和外国反动分子的阴谋幻想一齐破灭。但是不能不令人愤慨和遗憾的是在邻邦印度出现了一班干涉张义分子，他们当然不能代表印度人民，但是他们违背五项原则和万隆精神，干涉我国内政，支持西藏叛乱，觊觎我国的领土西藏，同帝国主义者如出一辙。这是中国人民所决不能容忍的。噶伦堡成为西藏反动分子在国外进行叛国活动的基地，已非一日。现在，印度某些野心家仍然利用西藏叛乱事件对友邦中国兴风作浪，有加无已。西藏是中国不可分割的领土。这是任何人无法否认的事实。印度的干涉主义分子竟敢承袭英帝国主义的衣钵，阴谋创造所谓“西藏独立”，以便把西藏从中国分裂出去而置于外国宰割之下。为了掩饰其不可告人的勾当，欺蒙人民，逃避谴责，并继续干涉中国内政，还由印度外交人员散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这个谎话连篇，漏洞百出，显然是强加于达赖喇嘛的荒谬文件，遭到西藏人民、佛教领袖和全世界公正人士的严正驳斥和一致反对，已经原形毕露。但印度的野心家还在假借达赖喇嘛名义，进行狡赖，可见他们野心未死。这些外国阴谋家显然忘记了中国人民现在不是软弱可欺。中国人民一向遵守五项原则，珍视中印友谊，但决不能让外国的反动派干涉我国内政，破坏我国的民族团结，分裂我国领土。帝国主义横行的日子已经一去不复返了。任何人要步英帝国主义的后尘，向新中国挑衅，是注定要完全失败的。印度野心家对中国的阴谋已经引起各方面的严厉谴责和反对。最近印度的公正舆论也一再指出利用西藏叛乱事件向中国领土打主意，那是作帝国主义的代理人，结果只有使印度利益遭到损害。这种忠言是值得印度干涉主义者记取的。认清局势，憣然改计，迅速停止一切干涉中国内政的阴谋活动，回到五项原则，尊重中印友谊，把矛头转向世界和平的共同敌人——帝国主义，那才是印度的真正利益所在，也是爱好和平友好的人对印度的诚恳希望。
    今天，人们已经生活在一个崭新的时代——“东风压倒西风”的伟大时代里。社会主义正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力磅礴于世界。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的建设飞跃发展，国际共产主义队伍紧密团结，日趋强大。世界被压迫民族的民族革命运动风起云涌，殖民体系的土崩瓦解，使帝国主义已经失去了过去的仓库和后方，帝国主义各国已经陷入严重的经济和政治危机，侵略集团之间争吵日多，正在走向四分五裂。帝国主义已腐朽衰败，日薄西山，和平力量空前强大，有力量制止帝国主义的战争挑衅。“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。中国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，在国内进行大跃进的同时，同苏联与其他社会主义兄弟国家，以及世界上一切爱好和平的人民一起更加满怀信心地保卫世界和平事业和人类进步，从胜利走向胜利。
