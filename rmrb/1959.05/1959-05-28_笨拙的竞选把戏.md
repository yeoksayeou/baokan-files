    Clumsy Election Tricks
    Editor's Note: The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial essay on May 19, exposing the false claim by Nobusuke Kishi that "Japan-China relations are a problem that must be solved" during the House of Councillors election, aimed at deceiving voters. The following is an excerpt translation:
    Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in his travel speeches supporting Liberal Democratic Party candidates for the House of Councillors, said that he would break the deadlock in Japan-China relations during his term. The problem lies in how to "break" the deadlock, but as soon as he touched on this point, Prime Minister Kishi shifted the focus to other aspects.
    It is said that according to Prime Minister Kishi's thinking, the condition for breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations is to "actually demonstrate that the government is stable and supported by the people." It is said that in this way, "China cannot ignore the Liberal Democratic Party government." This is a prerequisite.
    If these words are translated once again, they would become like this: "If the Liberal Democratic Party wins the House of Councillors election, 'Communist China' will not be able to remain silent. The other side will definitely express to Japan: 'Let's take some measures!' At that time, we can slowly deal with them!" It seems that he has completely forgotten the clumsy failures and obvious lack of understanding that the Kishi Cabinet has encountered in its diplomatic work with China over the past year.
    Let's assume that the Liberal Democratic Party wins the House of Councillors election, and that Nobusuke Kishi's permanent shogunate is formed. If the Kishi government is prepared to start all over again, from political negotiations to even considering the issue of recognizing China, then that can be discussed separately. Otherwise, if it still doesn't take down the sign that "politics and economics are two separate matters," then in that case, what can it possibly accomplish?
  Prime Minister Kishi also said that the prerequisite for breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations is a "domestic system centered on public opinion." However, when it comes to the China issue, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party hold their own opinions, sharply opposing each other, and public opinion is divided into two, practically forming two Japans.
    Perhaps the authorities are planning this: if they win the election, they will carry out activities with conservative, anti-China public opinion as the axis. However, if such an axis is used, there will be no progress in Japan-China relations.
    The government is currently not making any efforts to make progress in breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations. (The government) takes no action, but only verbally expresses its intention to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations, which, in the end, is nothing more than an election tactic.

### 笨拙的竞选把戏

    笨拙的竞选把戏
    编者按  日本“读卖新闻”5月19日发表一篇编辑随笔，暴露岸信介在参议员选举时一再强调“日中关系是一个必须加以解决的问题”的虚伪说法，是为了骗取选票。现摘译如下：
    岸信介首相曾经在声援自由民主党人竞选参议员时发表的旅行演说中说：关于日中问题，他要在他的任期内打开日中关系僵局。问题在于怎样“打开”日中关系僵局这一点，但是，一接触到这一点，岸信介首相就把重点转移到别的方面去了。
    据说，按照岸信介首相的想法，使日中关系僵局能够打开的条件是，“实际上显示出，政权已经稳定并且受到国民的支持。”据说，这样一来，“中国就不能不理自由民主党政府。”这是一个先决问题。
    如果再一次把这些话翻译一下，它们就会变成这样：“如果自由民主党在参议院选举中获胜，‘共产党中国’也无法保持缄默。对方一定会向日本方面表示：‘让我们采取某种措施吧！’到那个时候，我们慢慢地去同他们应酬应酬也就可以啦！”看来，他好像已经完全忘记了这一年来岸信介内阁在对中国外交工作上遭到的笨拙的失败和显出的认识不足。
    就假定自由民主党在参议院选举中获胜，假定岸信介永久幕府组成了吧。到时，如果岸信介政府准备重头做起，从政治谈判起，一直到承认中国问题也考虑，那可以暂作别论，不然的话，到时它还不拆下“政治和经济是两回事”那块招牌，那么，在那种情况下，究竟它能够干出什么事情呢？
  岸信介首相还说，打开日中关系僵局的先决条件是“以国民舆论为轴心的国内体制。”但是，一提到中国问题，自由民主党和社会党就各持己见，针锋相对，国民舆论也分而为二，简直形成了两个日本。
    也许当局是作这样打算的：如果在选举中获胜，就以保守的反中国的舆论为轴心展开活动。但是，如果用那样的一种轴心，日中关系是不会有什么进展的。
    政府目前没有作出什么努力，去使打开日中关系僵局的工作有所进展。（政府）不采取什么行动，而只在口头上表示要打开日中关系僵局，说来说去，这无非是一种竞选策略。
