Heroic City
Shan Chao

Gyantse City is one of the major cities in Tibet, located in the southwest of Tibet, on the banks of the fertile Nyang Chu River, and is a necessary passage from Yatung to Lhasa. Since the Tibetan people heroically resisted the British army in Gyantse in 1904, Gyantse City has been commonly known as the Heroic City.

To the east of Gyantse City, there is a prominent small hill with some collapsed houses on it. This is the remains of the famous Gyantse Fort.

In 1904, the British imperialist army invaded Tibet, and the Tibetan people launched a climax of defending the motherland and resisting aggression. Zhabuxi Daiben, who was stationed in Gyantse, led a team of Tibetan soldiers of that time, and together with the people of Gyantse, defended this hill (the then Zong government), using gunpowder cannons, muskets, boulders, "Wuduo" (note) and other weapons to severely attack the British imperialist invading army.

Although the heroic Gyantse Fort has been weathered for more than fifty years, the broken walls and ruins there are still clearly visible. One of the gunpowder cannons used in those years was still stored in the Jiangluo Linka in Gyantse after the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

After the British soldiers approached Gyantse, they attacked for several days without entering the city. The Tibetan compatriots used muskets, bows and arrows, and broadswords to block the foreign devils outside the city.

The British soldiers could not enter the city, and they could not go without eating. If they went out to find firewood, they were afraid that they would not be able to return to the barracks. They came up with a solution: they posted a notice saying that they were willing to buy cow dung and firewood with rice and silver, and let them be delivered to the gate of the barracks. When the Tibetan compatriots heard this news, they thought that they could take this opportunity to kill the foreign devils again.

Seven or eight of the Tibetan compatriots who were best at archery were selected to disguise themselves as firewood sellers and go to the barracks to sell firewood. They loaded arrows in the firewood bundles and hid sharp knives in their boot tubes, preparing to use knives to chop at close range and arrows to shoot at long range when they had the opportunity.

When the foreign devil soldiers saw someone coming to sell firewood, they shouted and made noise happily, wishing they could take the firewood away all at once, but the Tibetan compatriots who sold the firewood were not in a hurry, always clamoring that the price was unfair and refusing to sell; only after the reinforcements had been deployed did they slowly open the firewood bundles and cow dung bags. The foreign devil soldiers never dreamed that the firewood sellers would take out sharp knives and bows and arrows one after another, and like tigers, they began to kill and shoot. The foreign devil soldiers who bought the firewood were immediately killed in front of the barracks, and the remaining British soldiers wanted to resist stubbornly, but they had already been ambushed by the Tibetan compatriots and gained the upper hand.

When the reinforcements saw the fighting, they feigned an attack on the foreign devil barracks from behind. The foreign devil soldiers did not know which side to defend under the two-sided attack, and immediately panicked.

The Tibetan compatriots sang triumphant songs and returned to the city happily, and the citizens rushed to express their condolences and congratulations.

The most famous place in Gyantse City is Brown Mountain. If the foreign devil soldiers wanted to attack the city, they had to take Brown Mountain first. One day, more than two hundred foreign devil soldiers desperately charged up Brown Mountain. The Tibetan compatriots did not have time to load gunpowder, so they threw stones and wood down. When the foreign devil soldiers heard the rumbling sound, they did not know what kind of weapon it was. When they looked up, it was too late to hide, and many people were immediately smashed to pieces, and the stinking blood stained Brown Mountain red.

When the British soldiers arrived at night, they were so scared that they did not even dare to go out. Even if they did not go out, they could not escape their destined fate, because the Tibetan compatriots always took advantage of the darkness to sneak into their barracks.

One day, the British soldiers were sleeping soundly when they heard footsteps everywhere. Before they had time to open their eyes, with a snap, their heads had already moved.

After killing and slashing, the Tibetan compatriots who went to sneak into the camp took advantage of the darkness and chaos in the barracks to slip away without anyone knowing.

Later, after the British soldiers entered Gyantse City, they scrambled to rob the gold Buddha statues and treasures in the Gyantse Great Temple—Bajiao Qudeng Temple. They robbed all the things they could take away, and burned the things they could not take away. They could not move the large Buddha statue in the main hall, so the British soldiers used machetes to destroy the Buddha statue. Even now, the knife marks are still clearly visible. The Tibetan compatriots cover the knife marks with Hada, unable to bear to look at the traces of the British soldiers' crimes.

Two of the Buddha statue pictures "Guo Gu" in Bajiao Qudeng Temple were also robbed by them. Now, on the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of the Tibetan calendar every year, Bajiao Qudeng Temple will hold the "Guo Gu" Festival. When people walk into the Buddha Hall in the northeast corner and see that only one of the original three silk paintings of gods—"Guo Gu"—is left, they are extremely angry at the British imperialist robbers.

At that time, the people of Gyantse sang such folk songs:

Inside the house of Mimi Guta,
Lives a group of foreign bad eggs;
Bad eggs, don't be anxious to clamor:
"Twenty-ninth" will let you leave the world together! ("Twenty-ninth" is the Tibetan calendar December 29th, the Ghost Festival.)

(Note) "Wuduo" is a kind of rope made of wool, round at both ends and flat in the middle, usually used to throw stones to hit cattle and sheep. (Attached picture)

This is the remains of Gyantse Fort, where the Tibetan people heroically resisted the British invading army in 1904.

    英雄城

    江孜城是西藏的大城市之一，位于西藏的西南部，在富饶的年楚河岸上，是亚东到拉萨的必经之地。自从1904年藏族人民在江孜英勇的抗击了英国军队后，江孜城普遍被人称为英雄城。
    在江孜城的东面，有座突出的小山头，上面有些倒塌的房子，这就是有名的江孜炮台的遗迹。
    1904年，英帝国主义军队侵入西藏，藏族人民掀起了一个保卫祖国、抗击侵略的高潮。驻扎在江孜的扎布西代本，率领着一队当年的藏军，和江孜人民一起，据守在这个山头上（当时的宗政府），用火药土炮、鸟枪、巨石、“乌多”（注）等武器，痛击英帝侵略军。
    英勇的江孜炮台，虽然经过了五十多年的风吹雨打，但是那里的断垣残壁仍然清晰可见。当年使用的火药土炮，直到西藏和平解放以后，还有一门存放在江孜的降老林卡里面。
    英国兵逼近江孜以后，攻了好几天都没攻到城里去，藏族同胞用土枪、弓箭、大刀把鬼子兵挡在城外。
    英国兵进不了城，总不能不吃饭呵，出门去找烧柴吧，又怕回不了兵营，他们想出了一个办法，贴出告示说，愿意用大米和银子买牛粪和柴，让送到兵营门口来。藏胞听了这个消息，便想到又可以借此机会来杀鬼子了。
    藏胞中选了七、八个最会射箭的人，扮成卖柴的样子，往兵营去卖柴。他们在柴捆里装上了箭，又在靴筒里藏上尖刀，准备得到机会以后，近的用刀子砍，远的用箭射。
    鬼子兵见有人来卖柴，高兴的乱叫乱闹，恨不得一下子把烧柴拿走，可是卖柴的藏胞不慌不忙，总是嚷着价钱不公平，不肯卖；直到援兵已布置好了以后，才慢慢的打开柴捆和牛粪口袋，鬼子兵做梦也没想到，卖柴人纷纷拿出了尖刀和弓箭，像老虎一样杀射起来，买柴的鬼子兵，立刻被杀死在兵营门前，其余的英国兵，还想进行顽抗，但早被埋伏下的藏胞占了上风。
    援兵看见打起来了，就在背后去佯攻鬼子兵营，鬼子兵在两面进攻的情况下，不知道守哪一边好，立刻慌作一团。
    藏胞唱着得胜歌，高高兴兴的回到了城里，市民们纷纷赶来慰问和庆贺。
    江孜城最有名的地方是棕山。鬼子兵要想攻进城去，必须先打下棕山。一天，二百多鬼子兵死命往棕山上冲锋，藏胞来不及装火药了，就把石块和木头扔下来，鬼子兵听到轰隆的声音，正不知是什么武器，抬头一看，躲也来不及了，立刻有不少的人被打得粉碎，臭血把棕山都染红了。
    英国兵一到天黑，吓得连门也不敢出，不出门也躲不开该死的命运，因为藏胞们总是趁黑夜去摸他们的兵营。
    一天，英国兵正在熟睡，只听四处都有脚步声，他们还没来得及把眼睁开的时候，咔嚓一下子，脑袋早已搬家了。
    去摸营的藏胞大杀大砍之后，趁着兵营漆黑一团，还乱糟糟的时候，神不知鬼不晓地又溜走了。
    后来英国兵打进了江孜城以后，争着去抢江孜大寺庙——八角取灯寺里的金佛像和宝物，他们把能拿走的东西都抢了一空，拿不走的就放火烧毁，大殿上的大佛像，他们搬不动，英国兵就用马刀把佛像砍毁。直到现在，刀痕仍清楚可见，藏胞用哈达把刀痕遮住，不忍看英国兵的罪恶的痕迹。
    八角取灯寺里的佛像图“郭古”，也被他们抢走了两幅。现在每年的藏历五月十三、四、五三天，八角取灯寺就要举行“郭古”节。当人们走进东北角的佛殿里，看见原有的三个用绸缎作的神的画像——“郭古”，如今只剩下了一个的时候，对英帝强盗就无比愤恨。
    当时江孜的人民曾唱着这样的民歌：
    米米古宅的房子里面，
    住着一群外国的坏蛋；
    坏蛋们，你们不要着急叫嚣：
    “二十九日”让你们一起离开人间！（“二十九日”系藏历12月29日赶鬼节。）
      （注）“乌多”是种用羊毛打的两头圆中间扁的绳子，通常用来抛石块打牛羊。（附图片）
    这是1904年藏族人民英勇抗击英国侵略军的江孜炮台遗迹。
