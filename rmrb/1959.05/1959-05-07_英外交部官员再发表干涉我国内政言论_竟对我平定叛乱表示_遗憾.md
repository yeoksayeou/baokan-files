Xinhua News Agency, London, May 5th: British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Lansdowne, during a debate in the House of Lords on the 4th, actually expressed "regret" over the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. This is another instance, following British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's blatant slander on April 29th accusing the Chinese government of "depriving Tibet of its autonomy," of British officials openly making remarks interfering in China's internal affairs.

Lansdowne said, "We regret any actions the Chinese government may take that prevent Tibet from enjoying autonomy, and we particularly regret the use of force."

Lansdowne made these remarks in response to questions from Labour MP Henderson regarding the rebellion in Tibet. Henderson also expressed clear hostility towards China in his speech. He said: "I regret that it has not been possible to have the Chinese condemned by the United Nations General Assembly for its policy in Tibet. It would undoubtedly have faced fierce criticism."

He also said: "This is another example of the foolish act of excluding Communist China from the international community."

Henderson also said during the foreign policy debate that it was wrong for India to bear the cost of providing relief to Tibetan refugees. He said: "I hope this government has already asked Mr. Nehru whether he would welcome foreign relief aid." "If such aid is welcomed, I believe the British government will act quickly to make a contribution in the name of the British people."

　  英外交部官员再发表干涉我国内政言论
    竟对我平定叛乱表示“遗憾”
    新华社5日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部政务次官兰斯当尼4日在上议院答复辩论时竟然对中国政府平定西藏叛乱表示“遗憾”。这是继英国外交大臣劳埃德在上月29日公然诬蔑中国政府“剥夺西藏自治”之后，英国官方人士又一次公然发表干涉中国内政的言论。
    兰斯当尼说，“对于中国政府可能采取的任何使西藏不能享受自治的行动，我们都感到遗憾，我们特别对于使用武力感到遗憾。”
    兰斯当尼是在答复工党议员汉德逊就中国西藏叛乱事件的询问时发表这番话的。汉德逊在讲话中也表露了明显的对中国的敌意。他说：没有能够使中国由于它对西藏的政策而受到联合国大会的谴责，这使我感到遗憾。它本来无疑会面对猛烈的批评。
    他还说：“这是把共产党中国排斥在国际大家庭以外这一愚蠢行动的又一例子。”
    汉德逊在辩论外交政策时还说，由印度来负担救济西藏难民的费用是不对的。他说：“我希望这个政府已经在询问尼赫鲁先生，他是否欢迎外来的救济援助”。“如果欢迎这种援助的话，我相信英国政府会迅速采取行动，以英国人民的名义作出捐献。”
