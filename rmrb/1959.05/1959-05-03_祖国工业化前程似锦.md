We fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and all other reports.

Premier Zhou's report comprehensively and correctly summarizes the brilliant achievements and experiences since the first National People's Congress, especially the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and puts forward a grand plan for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959. This report will undoubtedly further inspire the people of the whole country to strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

Recently, several of us inspected Shanghai for seven days. The main projects and units inspected were: the Steam Turbine Plant, the Motor Factory, the Jiangnan Shipyard, the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, the Printing and Dyeing Factory, the Pioneer People's Commune, and other specialized inspections.

During the inspection process, we received a profound socialist and communist education, which strengthened our understanding and confidence in the future of socialist construction in our motherland. The gains were significant.

Shanghai is an old industrial base and occupies a very important position in China's industrialization. In the comprehensive production Great Leap Forward of 1958, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the implementation of the socialist general line, the implementation of the whole set of policies of walking on two legs, the resolute reliance on and mobilization of the broad masses, and the implementation of the three-way combination of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, a great technical revolution was launched on the industrial front, resulting in tremendous achievements: total industrial output value increased by 50.3 percent compared to 1957, and the labor productivity of employees increased by 38 percent compared to 1957. The labor productivity of production workers increased by two thousand six hundred and ninety, which fully illustrates that Shanghai's production landscape underwent profound changes in last year's Great Leap Forward! And it will continue to undergo even greater and more profound changes!

Situation of Several Important Factories in Shanghai

Now let us briefly report on the situation of several important factories we inspected:

I. Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant: This plant was established in 1953 with the help of Czechoslovak experts. At that time, it could only manufacture power generation equipment of 6,000 kilowatts. However, after several years of efforts and continuous summing up of experience, they can now design and produce on their own. The number of employees has grown from 380 to 6,500, and the production capacity has gradually expanded from producing 1,000 kilowatts, 5,000 kilowatts, and 10,000 kilowatts to 25,000 kilowatts. Especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, thanks to the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act established by the workers, and the great technical revolution, they completed a production task of 540,000 kilowatts throughout the year. The total output value reached 86.41 million yuan, which was 245 percent of 1957.

This year, they continue to exert their efforts and strive for a greater and better leap forward, implement the "policy of both increasing output and developing towards high, large, precise, and cutting-edge" products, and ensure the successful trial production of 21 new products. The most prominent of these are several large and cutting-edge new products such as 50,000-kilowatt and 100,000-kilowatt steam turbines, 4250M3/minute blowers, and 5,000-horsepower marine engines, and ensure that the annual leap forward reaches 2.4 million kilowatts. The annual output value reaches 190 million yuan. These are inspiring production targets!

II. Shanghai Motor Factory: This factory was taken over from the Kuomintang reactionaries. The foundation was very weak and the technology was low. At that time, it could only produce 200-horsepower motors. However, after several years of transformation and creation after liberation, it has developed into a comprehensive motor factory of considerable scale. Especially in the Great Leap Forward, it made outstanding contributions to the country. It successfully trial-produced 25 new products, including the 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator successfully trial-produced at the same time as the Harbin Motor Factory, the 60-kilowatt 10,000-ampere high-current DC generator, and the 12,000-kilowatt new type steam turbine generator, a world-class cutting-edge product.

The total output value of the factory in 1958 reached more than 110 million yuan, which was 2.78 times that of 1957. The labor productivity increased by 78.3 percent compared to 1957, and the product cost decreased by 17.4 percent compared to 1957. This year, they proposed to increase the total output value by 1.26 times compared to last year, and strive to increase labor productivity by 50 percent compared to last year, and reduce costs by 10.82 percent.

III. Jiangnan Shipyard: This factory was established during the Qing government and has a history of 94 years. At that time, the average annual output was 4,000 tons. During the Kuomintang reactionary era, not only did it not develop, but it also declined to 2,000 tons. After liberation, through rectification and innovation, production has continuously developed. The number of employees has grown from more than 2,000 to 12,000. Especially in the Great Leap Forward, they implemented the slogan "Take steel as the key link, everything for steel, with steel there are ships," and not only completed the task of 6,400 tons of steel, but also excellently manufactured the "Peace No. 28" ship with a deadweight of 6,500 tons and a displacement of 8,600 tons. The total output value in 1958 reached 110.063 million yuan, an increase of 52 percent compared to 1957, the labor productivity increased by 37 percent compared to 1957, and the cost decreased by 14.2 percent. This year, the total output value is to be completed at more than 180 million yuan, an increase of 88 percent compared to 1958, and two main tasks are proposed: (1) To complete the production task of a 12,000-ton hydraulic press. The completion of this task will play a major role in heavy machinery. (2) To complete the tasks of the Jiangsu and Jinling train ferries before National Day this year.

IV. Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant: This plant has established a blast furnace workshop, two converter workshops, and a rolling mill workshop. This year, it plans to build a third converter workshop, a seamless steel pipe workshop, an oil refinery, and a machine repair workshop.

During the Great Leap Forward, thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the workers, the capacity equipment of the open hearth furnace was increased from 60 tons to 80 tons (the previous foundation was 15 tons). For example, in the past, it took 20 to 30 minutes to produce a furnace of steel in the converter, but later it leapt to 16 minutes. Therefore, the plant overfulfilled the task assigned to them by the state, leaping from a task of 240,000 tons of steel to 450,000 tons of steel! And this year, they will bravely advance towards 550,000 tons, or even higher targets!

During the inspection process, we realized that, except for the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, the other three plants were taken over from the reactionaries. The foundation was very weak and production was very depressed. However, in the past few years after liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the workers have worked selflessly with the attitude of masters, and not only restored production in a short period of time, but also gradually developed. Some of their production has doubled, and some have doubled several times. Its development process can be said to have gone from small to large, from general to complex, from backward to advanced, and in some products it has reached or exceeded international standards. For example, the Jiangnan Shipyard manufactured a Peace No. 28 ship, which was not only unimaginable in the old society, but even after liberation, if the workers were not politically in command and their minds were not liberated, it would be difficult to imagine. However, as a result of the rectification movement, the workers broke superstitions, promoted the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and combined it with the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, it quickly turned into a material force. Therefore, they only spent five months and twenty days (it used to take eighteen months) to manufacture a ship with a deadweight of 6,500 tons. For example, the Shanghai Motor Factory only spent 100 days to successfully trial-produce the first 12,000-kilowatt new type steam turbine generator. For example, the output of motors from the Motor Factory in one and a half months approached the output of the entire year of 1957. These are unprecedented and amazing feats!

At the same time, we realized that the power of the working masses is infinite. As long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, boldly mobilize the masses, and are good at following the mass line, we can break through all difficulties and develop according to the principle of socialist high speed. For example, in the Great Leap Forward in production, the workers of the Shanghai Motor Factory put forward the slogan "Everyone has brilliant ideas, every aspect has transformation, and there is realization every day" "Where there is difficulty, look for brilliant ideas"... A total of 12,400 brilliant ideas were put forward throughout the year, and 6,427 were realized, saving the country 8.51 million yuan. Some of these projects have reached the level of advanced world technology. For example, the cutting-edge technology of casting aluminum for large rotors broke through the "limit" of rotor aluminum casting that was considered by foreign countries and climbed to the peak of the world's scientific level. These examples fully illustrate how significant it is to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign centered on technical innovation and technical revolution on the production front!

In summary, although we only took a cursory look during our few days of inspection, the impression it gave us was extremely profound: the enthusiasm of the Shanghai workers for labor and production is high, their morale is high, their energy is soaring, and all factories are leaping forward. At the same time, from the development prospects of these factories, we can also see that the motherland's industrialization development prospects are very magnificent and splendid, truly a bright future with boundless happiness! Let us resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, ride the wind and waves, and fight heroically to build our great socialist motherland!

Three suggestions

I. We suggest that the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant change the impulse steam turbine to a reaction steam turbine. The manufacture of reaction steam turbines can not only save steel, but more importantly, save fuel. For example, an impulse steam turbine requires six kilograms of steam to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity, while a reaction steam turbine only requires about four kilograms of steam to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity. In this way, one-third of the fuel can be saved per kilowatt-hour of electricity, which will play a major role in our current technological innovation.

II. When we inspected the Steam Turbine Plant, we saw that individual workers were operating next to the electric furnace without wearing work clothes. This is prone to accidents. Therefore, it is recommended that the plant must strengthen production safety education to ensure production safety.

III. When we inspected the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, all the places where workers repaired the converter close to the molten steel were made of magnesia bricks. We believe that the material cost is too high if all magnesia bricks are used. Is it possible to combine magnesia sand and dolomite for use? We believe that the effect is the same, and the cost can be reduced.

Except for the second point, the other two points are immature opinions and are for reference only.

专栏：

    祖国工业化前程似锦
    林克明　王生保　梅日新　陈秋安　张汉明代表、方少逸　陈伊林委员的联合发言
    我们完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告和其他各项报告。
    周总理的报告是全面地、正确地总结了首届人民代表大会会议以来，特别是一九五八年大跃进的辉煌成就和经验，并提出一九五九年继续大跃进的宏伟计划。这个报告，无疑的将会进一步鼓舞全国人民，为完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划而奋斗。
    最近，我们几个人到上海视察了七天，视察的主要项目和单位是：汽轮机厂、电机厂、江南造船厂、上海一钢厂、印染厂和先锋人民公社及其他专业性视察。
    在视察的过程中，我们受到一次深刻的社会主义、共产主义教育，加强了我们对祖国社会主义建设前途认识和信心。收获是很大的。
    上海是个老工业基地，在我国工业化上是占很重要的地位。在一九五八年全面生产大跃进中，由于在党正确领导下，贯彻了社会主义总路线，贯彻了两条腿走路一整套的方针，坚决依靠和发动广大群众，实行领导干部、工人、技术人员三结合，在工业战线上大闹技术革命，因而取得了巨大的成就：工业总产值比一九五七年增长百分之五十点三，职工劳动生产率比一九五七年增长百分之三十八，生产工人劳动生产率增长了二千六百九十，这充分说明，在去年大跃进中，上海生产面貌起了深刻的变化！而且将会继续起更大更深刻的变化！
    上海几个重要工厂情况
    现在让我们把视察过的几个重要工厂的情况，简要的汇报如下：
    一、上海汽轮机厂：这个厂是在一九五三年由捷克斯洛伐克专家帮助下建立的，当时只能制造六千瓩的发电量设备，但经过几年的努力，不断的总结经验，他们完全可以由自己边设计、边生产，职工由三百八十人发展到六千五百人，而且生产能力逐步扩大，由生产一千瓩、五千瓩、一万瓩，而至二万五千瓩。特别是在一九五八年大跃进中，由于工人群众，树立敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，大闹技术革命，全年完成了五十四万瓩的生产任务。生产总值达八千六百四十一万元，为一九五七年的百分之二百四十五。
    今年他们继续鼓足干劲，争取更大更好的跃进，贯彻执行“既提高产量，又向高、大、精、尖发展的方针”，要确保二十一种新产品试制成功。其中最突出的如五万、十万瓩的汽轮机，4250M3／分的鼓风机和五千船机等几项大型尖端新产品，并确保全年跃进到二百四十万瓩。年产值达一亿九千万元。这是令人振奋的生产指标！
    二、上海电机厂：这个厂是从国民党反动派手里接管过来的，底子非常薄弱，技术又低，当时只能生产二百匹的马力，但经过解放后几年来的变革、创造，已发展成为有相当规模的综合性的电机厂。特别是在大跃进中，对国家作出了出色的贡献。试制成功的有二十五种的新产品，其中有与哈尔滨电机厂同时试制成功的二点五万瓩的汽轮发电机，六十瓩一万安高电流直流机和世界尖端产品的一点二万瓩新型汽轮发电机。
    该厂一九五八年全年总产值达一亿一千多万元，为一九五七年的二点七八倍，劳动生产率比一九五七年提高百分之七十八点三，产品成本比一九五七年降低百分之十七点四，今年总产值他们提出要比去年增加一点二六倍，劳动生产率要比去年提高百分之五十，成本降低百分之十点八二而努力。
    三、江南造船厂：这个厂在清政府时候已建立，已有九十四年的历史，当时年产量平均四千吨。在国民党反动派时代，不仅没有发展，而且下降到二千吨。解放后，经过整顿、革新，生产不断地发展，职工由二千多人发展到一万二千人，特别是大跃进中，他们贯彻了
  “以钢为纲，一切为了钢，有钢才有船”的口号，不但完成了六千四百吨钢的任务，而且出色的制造了一艘载重六千五百吨，排水量八千六百吨的“和平二十八号”轮船。一九五八年总产值达一亿一千零六十三万元，比一九五七年增长百分之五十二，劳动生产率比一九五七年提高百分之三十七，成本降低百分之十四点二，而今年生产总值要完成一亿八千万多元，比一九五八年增长百分之八十八，并提出两项的主要任务：（1）要完成一万二千吨的水压机的生产任务，这一项任务完成，在重型机器方面将起重大的作用。（2）要在今年国庆节前完成江苏号、金陵号两艘火车渡轮的任务。
    四、上海第一钢铁厂：这个厂建立了一个高炉车间，二个转炉车间和一个轧钢车间，今年计划要建立第三个转炉车间，一个无缝钢管车间，一个炼油厂，和一个机器修配车间。
    在大跃进当中，由于工人群众发挥了冲天干劲，把平炉的容量设备由六十吨提高到八十吨（过去的底子是十五吨）又如转炉过去炼一炉钢需要二十至三十分钟，后来跃进到十六分钟，因此，该厂超额完成了国家给他们的任务，由二十四万吨钢的任务，跃进到四十五万吨钢！而今年要向五十五万吨，或更高的指标，英勇前进！
    在视察过程中，我们体会到：这几个厂，除了上海汽轮机厂外，其他三个厂都是从反动派手里接管过来的，底子是非常薄弱，生产非常萎缩。但解放后几年来，由于党的正确领导，工人群众以主人翁的姿态，忘我地劳动，不但在短期内恢复了生产，而且逐步的发展起来，他们的生产有的翻了一番，有的翻了几番，它的发展过程可以说由小到大，由一般到复杂，由落后到先进，并且在某些产品方面已达到或超过国际水平。例如江南厂制造出一艘和平二十八号轮船，不但在旧社会是梦想不到的，即使在解放后，如果工人群众政治不挂帅，思想不解放，也很难设想的。但由于整风的结果，工人群众破除迷信，发扬敢想、敢说、敢为的共产主义风格，与生产大跃进形势结合起来，很快就变成物质力量。因此，他们仅仅化了五个月零二十天的时间（过去要化十八个月）就制造出来载重六千五百吨的轮船。又如上海电机厂仅仅用一百天时间，就试制成功了第一台一点二万瓩新型汽轮发电机。又如电机厂的电动机，在一个半月的产量，就接近了一九五七年一年的产量，这都是史无前例惊人事迹！
    同时，我们体会到工人群众的力量是无穷无尽，只要坚决依靠党的领导放手发动群众，善于走群众路线，就能冲破一切困难，按照社会主义高速度原则发展。例如上海电机厂在生产大跃进中，工人群众提出要“人人有妙计，道道有改造，天天有实现”“那里有困难，那里找妙计”……的口号。全年共提出妙计一万二千四百条，实现了六千四百二十七条，为国家节约了八百五十一万元。其中有些项目已达到世界先进技术的水平。例如大型转子浇铝的尖端技术，就冲破了被国外认为转子铸铝的“极限”而攀登了世界科学水平的高峰。从这些事例充分说明在生产战线展开以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，是有多么重大意义！
    总括来说，我们虽然是走马看花的视察了几天，但给我们的印象是极其深刻的：上海工人群众劳动生产热情高涨，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，各个厂都在飞跃前进。同时，从这几个厂的发展前途也可以看到祖国工业化发展前途是非常雄伟、壮丽，真是前程似锦，幸福无边！让我们坚决的依靠党的领导，乘风破浪，为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而英勇斗争吧！
    三点建议
    一、我们建议上海汽轮机厂，把冲击式的汽轮机改为反击式。反击式汽轮机的制造，不但可节约钢材，而更重要的是节约燃料。例如冲击式的汽轮机需要六公斤的蒸汽才能发出一度电，而反击式的汽轮机只需要四公斤左右的蒸汽就可以发出一度电。这样，一度电可以节约三分之一的燃料，这对我们当前的技术革新，会起很大的作用。
    二、我们在汽轮机厂视察时，看到有个别工人没有穿工作服就在电炉旁操作，这是容易发生事故的，因此建议该厂必须加强生产安全教育，以确保生产安全。
    三、我们在上钢一厂视察时，工人修理转炉接近钢水的地方，全部都是用镁砖，我们认为全部用镁砖，材料成本是太高，是否可用镁沙和白云石结合来用，我们认为效果是一样，而成本可以减低。
    以上三点意见除第二点外，其他二点都是不成熟的意见，仅供参考。
