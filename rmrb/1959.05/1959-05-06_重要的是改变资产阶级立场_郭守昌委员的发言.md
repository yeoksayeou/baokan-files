Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice-Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, and the reports of Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen.

　　From the leaders' reports, I am excited to see that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have victoriously completed the first Five-Year Plan; and have achieved great achievements in the first year of the second Five-Year Plan. The 1959 national economic plan is an even more ambitious plan, which is truly a great joy that makes people excited and ecstatic. I will definitely further participate in this heroic and great cause, and under the leadership of the Party, complete all the tasks assigned to me by the Party, fulfilling a responsibility and sharing a glory. The armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group has suffered a shameful defeat. Indian expansionists will inevitably suffer the same, even more disastrous, defeat. The Chinese people will not allow themselves to be bullied again.

　　Premier Zhou and Vice-Chairman Li's reports also mentioned the issue of reforming bourgeois elements, and I would like to talk about my own experience in this regard.

　　In the autumn of 1956, the Party sent me to study at the Socialist Academy. Through learning, I improved my awareness to a certain extent. In the future, I must continue to work hard to transform myself to continue to improve. Looking back on the past, I am truly ashamed and extremely grateful to the Party!

　　I was born into a landlord family and later became an agent for capitalists. The bourgeois selfish, profit-seeking ideology occupied my entire mind. Looking at problems from the bourgeois standpoint, I always started from personal interests, only wanted to get rich, and thought that with money, everything could be solved. I did not hesitate to use various vicious and deceptive means to exploit and oppress the working people, walking on the decadent and declining capitalist road. After liberation, under the control of the ugly bourgeois ideology, I always felt that the Party's policies and guidelines were wrong, and I had varying degrees of suspicion and resistance. Although the Party explained and persuaded in various occasions, I was always obedient in words but not in my heart. Even if I did things according to the Party's policies, it was out of helplessness, and such a mood was completely opposite to that of the working people. How could it be because of "not being careful"?

　　My thinking changed a little bit from 1951. In 1953, after studying the Party's "General Line for the Transition Period," my thinking advanced a little more. But when faced with practical problems, I still often started from personal interests, and that selfish, profit-seeking nature would emerge again. When someone criticized this kind of thinking and behavior, I would think in my heart: "I wasn't careful, and I got criticized again"; "My memory is not good, I forget easily, I will pay attention next time." But the next time, I relapsed. I couldn't find the reason myself, and I thought it was because I was "not careful."

　　After my factory became a joint state-private enterprise in 1954, under the leadership of the state representative, the work went very smoothly, and a new atmosphere appeared in the factory's production. I thought that since the enterprise had become a joint state-private enterprise and I got along well with the state representative, I was almost transformed. Sometimes, when I introduced my experience in accepting socialist transformation to others, I would just recite a section from the editorials in the newspapers or the leaders' reports, thinking that this was a safe way to avoid making mistakes. It sounded like I had figured everything out. In fact, I didn't understand the true meaning of transformation. I thought in my heart, "The Party says transformation, and I also say transformation. If I don't say I accept transformation, I will be criticized. There is nothing wrong with talking more about transformation." But I couldn't explain what to transform or how to transform myself. In the autumn of 1956, when the Party sent me to study at the Socialist Academy, I was very happy, thinking: What exactly is Marxism-Leninism? This time I can finally learn it. When I first entered the school, I memorized nouns and definitions, preparing to show off my abilities to others after I left the school; I didn't think about how to connect with myself, combine with reality, and strengthen my own transformation at all.

　　Cannot Deceive Oneself

　　In the summer of 1957, the Party launched a rectification campaign. The rightists in the Socialist Academy took the opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, slandering the constitution, the people's democratic dictatorship system, the five major movements, and the three major transformations. When I heard these rightist remarks, I couldn't distinguish between right and wrong. Although I felt that some of the words were a bit wrong, I also felt that they made some sense. When the Party exposed the ugly face of the rightists who were anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist, and called on the people of the whole country to carry out the anti-rightist struggle, our Socialist Academy also launched a struggle against the rightists among the students, using the method of presenting facts and reasoning to defeat the rightists' frenzied attack. Combined with the struggle, we studied relevant documents. We studied after a period of struggle, which not only forcefully attacked the rightists, but also improved the students' political and theoretical levels, and gradually made everyone accustomed to conducting mutual criticism and self-criticism. I participated in this extremely sharp struggle between the enemy and ourselves and received a profound education. I only began to realize that the content of socialist transformation is not only to transform capitalist enterprises, but more importantly, it is also necessary to seriously transform people's world outlook, political stand, and ideology. I only began to realize the true meaning of social existence determining ideology. The reason why I had suspicions and resistance towards the Party's policies, was obedient in words but not in my heart, and other ideological situations in the past was that my past political interests, economic interests, and living environment determined such an ideology, and my capitalist class stand and class nature were constantly controlling my actions, which was by no means a matter of being careful or not, nor a matter of having a good or bad memory. For example, I had some understanding of the nature and tasks of the Party, its guidelines and policies, and the great achievements of the five major movements and the three major transformations, through listening to reports and studying documents and theories. Why was it that when the rightists reversed black and white and launched a large-scale attack on the Party, I was indifferent and did not rise up to defend the Party, and even echoed them? This is a matter of class stand. If we only study bookish theoretical knowledge without combining it with stand transformation, and do not change our political stand and ideology from the bottom of our hearts, even if we memorize the books and talk about them logically, it is useless. Therefore, I realized that studying Marxism-Leninism, and only reaching the point of being able to write and speak on the surface, cannot be considered a solution to the problem. We must link it with reality, link it with our thinking, and at the same time combine it with social practice and labor training to strengthen self-transformation in order to master this weapon, both to transform the world and to transform ourselves, and to change our world outlook, political stand, and ideology. This is the truth. Only relying on being tough-mouthed and saying that we have transformed ourselves almost is deceiving ourselves.

　　Labor is Pleasant and Glorious

　　I also participated in physical labor at the Socialist Academy, helping farmers in the people's communes to pick peanuts, dig corn stalks, accumulate manure, and so on. I had lived a life of not working for a long time, oppressing others to work for me, and always thought that physical labor was very hard. Through learning, I realized that society is created by labor, without labor there can be no society, and there would be no such development of mankind today; labor is pleasant. Therefore, in my mind, "labor is very hard" and "labor is pleasant" were fighting fiercely.

　　Our academy called on students to participate in labor on a voluntary basis. The elderly, the weak, and those who are sick can choose not to participate, or they can visit the labor, with complete freedom of choice. I volunteered to participate in labor. Through my own labor practice and theoretical study, I deeply realized that labor is originally a noble activity and a fundamental element of human life, but in the old society, because the fruits of the labor of the working people were all exploited by the exploiting classes, they could not eat enough, could not dress warmly, and lived an extremely poor life. At the same time, the exploiting classes deliberately slandered labor as a "lowly" thing and discriminated against the working people everywhere. This exactly shows the crimes of the exploiting classes in oppressing the working people. I mistakenly regarded labor and exploitation and oppression as the same thing, and actually thought that labor was very hard, which was entirely from the bourgeois ideology.

　　Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the working people are not subjected to exploitation and oppression, and use their own hands and their own hard work to build their own socialism and communism. They are engaged in a very heroic cause with conscious labor, which is a different nature from the forced labor in the old society, so it is pleasant, it is to create happiness for mankind, and it is respected everywhere. Labor may be tiring, but tiring is definitely not bitter. Therefore, being able to participate in such a heroic labor cause as a member is very glorious. This dispelled my long-held mistaken belief that labor is very hard, and further increased my interest in participating in physical labor and strengthened my determination to transform myself.

　　No More Barriers

　　I studied at the Socialist Academy for more than two years, studied theory, and participated in the anti-rightist struggle movement and labor training. After graduation, I returned to my original work post. When I saw the Party branch secretary and the state representative of my factory, I felt very close and there were no barriers. They were also more concerned about me. Sometimes I also participated in the enlarged meeting of the Party branch, and I felt very honored. Working and living with the workers also felt very natural. The workers were more affectionate to me than before. They were willing to talk to me about any problems, and the relationship was further harmonized. In my work, I always remembered the teachings of the academy. I established a belief in the depths of my mind that I must resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party and the working class, and humbly learn from the workers and masses, and I dare not think that they are inferior to me anymore. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the workers and the masses, after two months of work, I also solved some specific production problems for the factory, and I received verbal praise from the Party branch, which gave me great encouragement. In general, the Party's cultivation and education are meticulous. If I can really say that there have been some changes, it should be attributed to the Party and to the direct education of the Socialist Academy. I should continue to work hard in the future, break the capitalist stand, establish the socialist stand, resolutely guard against arrogance and complacency, and strive to learn in the era of the Great Leap Forward. Strengthen transformation and actively serve, so that I can become a self-reliant laborer as soon as possible to answer the Party's care and cultivation of me.

### 重要的是改变资产阶级立场  郭守昌委员的发言

专栏：

　　重要的是改变资产阶级立场
    郭守昌委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席的政协全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告及李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    从首长们的报告，我兴奋地看到我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，胜利地完成了第一个五年计划；在第二个五年计划的第一年取得了伟大的成就。一九五九年的国民经济的计划更是一个宏伟的计划，真是使人欢欣鼓舞、心花怒放的大喜事。我一定进一步地参加这一豪迈的、伟大的事业，在党的领导下，完成党所交给我的一切任务，尽一份责任，分一份光荣。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱，已经遭到了可耻的失败。印度的扩张主义分子也必然同样的遭到更惨重的失败，中国人民是不容再欺负的了。
    周总理和李副主席的报告也都提到了对资产阶级分子的改造问题，我想就这个方面谈一谈自己的体会。
  一九五六年秋党送我到社会主义学院学习，通过学习，在一定程度上提高了觉悟，今后我仍须继续努力改造自己，以求继续提高。回想过去，真是惭愧万分，对党更是感激不尽！
    我是地主家庭出身，以后又当了资方代理人。资产阶级自私自利、唯利是图的思想意识，盘据了我整个头脑，在资产阶级立场上看问题，凡事从个人利益出发，只想发财，认为有了钱，什么事都解决了，不惜使用各种恶毒、欺骗的手段，剥削、压迫劳动人民，走在腐朽的、没落的资本主义道路上。解放后，在资产阶级的丑恶思想意识支配下，对党的政策、方针，我总看着不对，怀有不同程度的怀疑、抵触。党虽在各种场合讲解、说服，但我总是口服心不服，有的事即便是按照党的政策作了，也是无可奈何，不得不作，这样的心情，与劳动人民完全相反。岂是“不加小心”的缘故？
    一九五一年起我的思想有一点转变。一九五三年学习了党的“过渡时期总路线”，思想又前进了一点儿。但是遇到实际问题，仍然常常从个人利益出发，那个自私自利、唯利是图的本质就又冒了出来。有人批评这种思想行为，我心里就想：“不加小心，又叫人家批评了”；“记性不好，好忘，下次注意”。但到下一次，依然故态复发，原因何在，自己找不着，还认为这是“不加小心”的缘故。
    一九五四年我厂公私合营后，在公方代表的领导下，工作是很顺利的，工厂的生产出现了新气象。我以为将企业公私合营了，与公方代表处的也很好，这就是改造得差不多了。有时我给别人介绍接受社会主义改造的经验，也都是将报纸上的社论或首长报告背出一段来，以为这样保险不会出差错。别人听起来，好像我什么都搞通了。其实，我对改造的真正意义并不了解，我心中想“党说改造，我也说改造。我如不说接受改造，挨批评。多谈改造没有错”，究竟改造什么，怎样改造，自己也说不清。一九五六年秋，当党送我到社会主义学院学习时，我非常高兴，心想：马列主义究竟是啥样，这回到底可以学习到了。初入学，我死记名词、定义，准备出校后，向别人炫耀一番，好显显自己的能耐；对于怎样联系自己，结合实际，加强改造自己，一点也没有想到。
    不可自己欺蒙自己
    一九五七年夏，党进行整风，社会主义学院的右派分子，乘机猖狂向党进攻，污蔑宪法，污蔑人民民主专政制度，污蔑五大运动、三大改造。我听了这些右派言论，分不清是非，虽也觉着话有些儿不对头，但又觉着有点儿道理。当党揭穿了右派分子的反共、反人民、反社会主义的丑恶面貌，号召全国人民进行反右派斗争的时候，我们社会主义学院也展开了对学员中的右派分子的斗争，用摆事实，讲道理的方法，打垮了右派分子的猖狂进攻，结合斗争，我们学习了有关文件。斗争一段，学习一段，既有力地打击了右派，又提高了学员的政治水平、理论水平，并使大家逐渐习惯了进行互相批评与自我批评。我参加了这个极为尖锐的敌我斗争的运动，受到了深刻的教育。我才初步认识到，社会主义改造的内容，不仅仅是改造资本主义企业，更主要的，还须认真地进行对人的世界观、政治立场和思想意识的改造。我才初步认识到社会存在决定思想意识的真正意义。我过去之所以对于党的政策有怀疑、抵触、口服心不服等等思想情况，是我的过去的政治利益、经济利益及生活环境决定了我这样的思想意识，是我的资本主义的阶级立场和阶级本质时刻支配着我的行动，绝不是什么加不加小心的问题，也不是什么记性好不好的问题。例如，我对于党的性质、任务，及其方针政策和五大运动、三大改造的伟大成就，通过听报告和学习文件、学习理论，不是没有一些儿了解的，为什么右派分子颠倒黑白，大肆向党进攻，而自己无动于衷，不起而捍卫党，竟致随声附和呢？这就是阶级立场问题。如只学习书本理论知识而不结合立场改造，不从骨子里改变政治立场思想意识，即便将书本背出来，讲起来头头是道，也是没有用的。因此我认识到学习马列主义，仅从表面上达到会写、会讲，这都不能算是解决问题。必须联系实际，联系思想，同时结合社会实践，劳动锻炼，加强自我改造，才能把这个武器掌握起来，既改造世界，也改造自己，改变自己的世界观、政治立场和思想意识。这是真理。只凭嘴硬，说自己改造的差不多了，是自己欺蒙自己。
    劳动是愉快的、光荣的
    我在社会主义学院也参加了体力劳动，到人民公社帮助农民摘花生、挖玉米秆子、积肥等等工作。我长期过着不劳而获的生活，压迫别人为我劳动，一向认为体力劳动是很苦的。通过学习，我认识到：社会是劳动创造的，没有劳动就不能有社会，也没有人类今天的这样发展；劳动是愉快的。因此，在我的思想中，“劳动是很苦的”与“劳动是愉快的”激烈地斗争着。
    我们学院号召学员在自愿的基础上参加劳动。年老、体弱、有病可不参加，也可以参观劳动，完全自由选择。我是自愿参加劳动的。通过自己的劳动实践与理论学习，我深刻地体会到劳动本来是一个崇高的活动，是人类生活的根本要素，但在旧社会由于劳动人民的劳动果实都被剥削阶级剥削去了，使他们吃不饱，穿不暖，过着极为贫困的生活，同时剥削阶级故意把劳动污蔑为“下贱”的事情，处处歧视劳动人民，这正好说明剥削阶级压迫劳动人民的罪恶。我错误地把劳动与剥削、压迫看成一个东西，竟认为劳动是很苦的，完全是从资产阶级的思想意识出发的。
    今天的劳动人民在中国共产党的领导下，不受剥削与压迫，用自己的双手，用自己的辛勤劳动，建设自己的社会主义、共产主义，是以自觉的劳动从事非常豪迈的事业，这就与旧社会的被迫劳动是不同的性质，所以是愉快的，是为人类创造幸福的，是到处受人尊敬的。劳动可能累，但累绝不是苦。因此，能参加到这样豪迈的劳动事业中作为一员，是非常光荣的。这样就打消了我一向以为劳动是很苦的错误认识，也更进一步地提高了我参加体力劳动的兴趣，和加强自我改造的决心。
    没有隔膜了
    我在社会主义学院学习了二年多，学习了理论，参加了反右派斗争运动和劳动锻炼。结业后，回到了原来工作岗位，看见了我厂的党支部书记、公方代表，我觉得非常亲热，没有隔膜。他们对我也更关怀。党的支部扩大会议，有时我也参加，我感到非常光荣。跟职工们一起劳动、一起生活，也觉得很自然。职工们对我比前更加亲热，有什么问题愿意和我谈，关系更进一步地融洽了。我在工作中时刻怀念学院对我的教导。我从思想深处树立起信念，一定坚决依靠党和工人阶级的领导，虚心向工人群众学习，再也不敢认为他们不如我了。在党的领导下，职工群众的支持下，经过两个月的工作，也给工厂解决了一部分生产上的具体问题，得到了党支部口头表扬，给我极大的鼓舞。总的来说，党的培养教导是无微不至的。如自己真的说有某些转变的话，应归功于党，归功于社会主义学院的直接教育。自己应在今后继续努力，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，坚决戒骄戒傲，在大跃进的年代里，努力学习。加强改造，积极服务，使自己早日成为一个自食其力的劳动者，来回答党对我的关怀与培养。
