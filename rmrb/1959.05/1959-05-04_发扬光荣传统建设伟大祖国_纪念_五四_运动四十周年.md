    Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition and Build a Great Motherland
    —Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement
    Today is the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. On this glorious festival of Chinese youth, which holds great historical significance, we extend warm congratulations to young people across the country on all fronts.
    Forty years ago, the Chinese people, under the heavy oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and reactionary rule, could no longer endure and rose up to resist aggression and oppression, launching a great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement that opened a new historical chapter in the Chinese people's democratic revolution. Under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after a long period of arduous struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice, overthrew the three great mountains weighing down on the Chinese people, completed the great people's democratic revolution, and achieved tremendous victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Chinese people have stood up, and the era of being bullied is gone forever. The ideals that the Chinese people dreamed of in the "May Fourth" era have become the magnificent and brilliant reality displayed before us.
    However, the struggle is not over. Today, imperialists and foreign reactionaries are taking advantage of the so-called Tibet issue to frantically interfere in our country's internal affairs, plotting to split the unity and unification of our great motherland. Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and quelling the rebellion in Tibet is China's internal affair, which absolutely does not allow any foreign interference. Commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, young people across the country should inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of opposing imperialism, unite with the people of the whole country, thoroughly quell the rebellion of the reactionary upper class group in Tibet, and smash the conspiracy of imperialists and Indian reactionaries to interfere in our country's internal affairs, support the rebels, and undermine our country's unity.
    This year is also the second year of the great Second Five-Year Plan, a decisive year for the "three years of hard struggle," and the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. Under the radiant light of the General Line, the people of the whole country are accelerating the construction of our great motherland with vigorous strides and soaring enthusiasm. Recently, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress adopted the 1959 National Economic Development Plan and called on the people of the whole country to launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and to continue to strive for new great leaps forward on all fronts of socialist construction. The main task of young people across the country at present is to combine the surging patriotic enthusiasm with the vigorous production drive, bravely throw themselves into this movement, continuously innovate, study diligently, and strive to be a "shock force" in socialist construction.
    The experience of the past forty years proves that whether it is the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, or the socialist transformation and socialist construction, young people—especially intellectual youth—must closely integrate with workers and peasants, and arm their minds with Marxism-Leninism, in order to carry out a firm struggle and achieve great victories. As Comrade Mao Zedong said when commemorating the 20th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement: "If intellectuals do not integrate with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." "True revolutionaries must be willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants."
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, intellectuals have worked hard to transform their ideology and have achieved considerable success. After the anti-Rightist struggle and the all-people rectification movement, intellectuals universally participated in production practice and physical labor, greatly advancing the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in the "Government Work Report": "Building a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals is a great historical task on the cultural and educational front. This contingent should be created by cultivating new intellectuals and transforming old intellectuals." In the ten years since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, this contingent of working-class intellectuals has been gradually forming, new intellectuals are gradually growing up, and old intellectuals are gradually progressing to varying degrees through self-transformation. However, implementing the policy of integrating intellectuals with the working people and combining education with productive labor is a long and arduous task. To build a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals, it is necessary to continue to work hard, thoroughly break with all kinds of bourgeois viewpoints, and truly arm new intellectuals and transform old intellectuals with the world outlook of the working class.
    To establish a proletarian world outlook, it is necessary to study Marxism-Leninism conscientiously. Forty years ago, when the Chinese people did not know Marxism-Leninism, the people's revolutionary struggle took many detours. The October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China, and when they were combined with Chinese reality, they gave rise to the May Fourth Movement and a series of great historical changes since the May Fourth Movement. Forty years of history prove that as long as we have Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people have a way, and the revolutionary and construction undertakings have a key. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the world, including China, to reconsider their own problems by using the proletarian world outlook as a tool for observing the destiny of the country. Following the path of the Russians—that is the conclusion." In the past, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, we achieved victory in the people's democratic and socialist revolutions. Now, we must achieve victory in socialist construction under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. To study Marxism-Leninism, we must first study the great works of Comrade Mao Zedong, who mastered and applied Marxism-Leninism to guide the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. We must earnestly study Comrade Mao Zedong's stand, viewpoints, and methods of mastering and applying Marxism-Leninism to guide the practice of the Chinese revolution, enhance our understanding, and do our work well.
    Commemorating the 40th anniversary of the great May Fourth Revolutionary Movement, we must hold high the anti-imperialist banner of the May Fourth Movement, carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the May Fourth Movement against imperialism, and smash aggression and resist interference. Commemorating the 40th anniversary of the great May Fourth Revolutionary Movement, we must hold high the banner of the cultural revolution of the May Fourth Movement, firmly use Marxism-Leninism to transform our thinking, further develop the vigorous mass movement of technological revolution and cultural revolution, and build our great socialist motherland into a more prosperous, stronger, more beautiful and happier country.

    发扬光荣传统建设伟大祖国
    ——纪念“五四”运动四十周年
    今天是“五四”运动的四十周年。在这个具有伟大历史意义的中国青年的光辉节日，我们谨向全国各个岗位上的青年致以热烈的祝贺。
    四十年前，中国人民在帝国主义、封建主义和反动统治的重重压迫剥削之下，忍无可忍，奋起反抗侵略，反对压迫，爆发了彻底的反帝反封建的伟大革命运动，揭开了中国人民民主主义革命新的历史一页。中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，经过长期的艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，完成了伟大的人民民主主义革命，并且取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大胜利。中国人民已经站立起来了，任人欺侮的时代已经一去不复返了。“五四”时代中国人民梦寐以求的理想，已经变成了展示在我们面前的辉煌灿烂的现实。
    但是，斗争并没有结束。今天，帝国主义和外国反动派，正在借口所谓的西藏问题，疯狂地干涉我国内政，阴谋分裂我们伟大祖国的团结和统一。西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，平定西藏叛乱是中国的内政，绝对不容许任何外国人的干涉。纪念“五四”运动四十周年，全国青年应当继承和发扬反对帝国主义的光荣传统，同全国人民团结一致，彻底平息西藏上层反动集团的叛乱，粉碎帝国主义和印度反动派干涉我国内政、支持叛乱分子、破坏我国统一的阴谋。
    今年，也是伟大的第二个五年计划的第二年，是“苦战三年”具有决定意义的一年，是伟大的中华人民共和国建国的十周年，全国人民正在总路线的万丈光芒照耀下，以雄健的步伐，冲天的干劲，加速建设我们的伟大祖国。最近，第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过了1959年国民经济发展计划，并号召全国人民掀起增产节约的群众运动，继续在社会主义建设的各个战线上努力实现新的大跃进。全国青年当前的主要任务，就是要使汹涌澎湃的爱国主义热情，结合轰轰烈烈的生产干劲，奋勇地投入到这个运动中去，不断革新，努力学习，争取做一个社会主义建设的“突击手”。
    四十年来的经验证明，无论是反帝反封建斗争，也无论是进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，青年——特别是知识分子的青年，必须紧密地同工人农民相结合，用马克思列宁主义来武装自己的思想，才能进行坚强的斗争，取得伟大的胜利。正如毛泽东同志在纪念“五四”运动二十周年时说过的：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”“真正的革命者必定是愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合的。”
    解放以来，知识分子在党和毛泽东同志领导下，努力进行思想改造，已经取得了相当巨大的成绩。在反右派斗争和全民整风运动以后，知识分子又普遍地参加了生产实践，参加了体力劳动，使知识分子同工农群众的结合大大地向前进了一步。周恩来总理在“政府工作报告”中指出：“建立一支成千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍，是文教战线的一项伟大的历史任务。这支队伍要依靠培养新知识分子和改造旧知识分子而产生。”伟大的中华人民共和国建国十年来，这支工人阶级知识分子队伍正在逐渐形成，新知识分子在逐渐成长起来，旧知识分子也在逐渐自我改造之中得到不同程度的进步。但是，贯彻知识分子和劳动人民相结合、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，是相当长期而艰巨的。要建立一支千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍，更须要继续努力，彻底同各式各样的资产阶级观点决裂，真正用工人阶级的世界观武装新的知识分子和改造旧的知识分子。
    要确立无产阶级的世界观，就要认真学习马克思列宁主义。四十年前，当中国人民不知道马克思列宁主义的时候，人民革命斗争曾经走过不少弯路。十月革命给中国送来了马克思列宁主义，他们同中国实际相结合，就产生了五四运动和五四以来的一系列伟大的历史变革。四十年的历史证明，只要有了马克思列宁主义，中国人民就有了办法，革命事业和建设事业就有了钥匙。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”过去，在马克思列宁主义指导下，我们取得了人民民主主义和社会主义革命的胜利，现在，我们必须在马克思列宁主义指导下，取得社会主义建设事业的胜利。我们要学习马克思列宁主义，首先要学习马克思列宁主义的理论同中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东同志的伟大著作。我们要认真学习毛泽东同志掌握和运用马克思列宁主义指导中国革命实践的立场、观点和方法，提高认识，做好工作。
    纪念伟大的五四革命运动四十周年，我们一定要高举五四运动的反对帝国主义的旗帜，发扬五四运动的反对帝国主义的革命传统，粉碎侵略，反击干涉。纪念伟大的五四革命运动四十周年，我们一定要高举五四运动的文化革命的旗帜，坚定地用马克思列宁主义来改造我们的思想，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的技术革命和文化革命的群众运动，把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建设得更加繁荣富强、更加美丽幸福。
