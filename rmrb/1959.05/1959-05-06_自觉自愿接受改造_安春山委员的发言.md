Comrades Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I firmly support Premier Zhou’s government work report and the various reports by the leading comrades.

　　This is the first time in my life that I have attended such a glorious and grand National People's Political Consultative Conference and attended the National People's Congress as a non-voting delegate, listened to the reports of our national leaders, and seen Chairman Mao. This is the glory that the Party and the people have given me, which makes me even more grateful to the Party and the people!

　　Just as the various socialist construction undertakings of our great motherland are developing by leaps and bounds, and the peaceful and happy lives of people of all ethnic groups are advancing on the broad road, a small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet, instigated and supported by British imperialists and Indian expansionists, openly launched an armed rebellion, betrayed the motherland, and committed heinous crimes. This small handful of rebellious elements also kidnapped the Dalai Lama and took him to India. Recently, Indian officials have distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's Statement," which is full of sophistry and full of loopholes. This fully exposes the ugly faces and sinister intentions of the Indian ambitious elements. We warn the Indian interventionists that the Chinese people love peace, but are by no means weak and easily bullied. The Chinese people, who have already stood up, will never allow others to infringe upon our sovereignty, interfere in our internal affairs, or attempt to lay hands on our sacred territory. The conspiracies and attempts of the Indian interventionists are doomed to failure.

　　I am an old soldier who revolted in Beijing peacefully. After the uprising, the Party patiently united, educated, and cared for my progress. In 1956, I was given the opportunity to leave my post and study in the Socialist Academy in Beijing, and I returned to work in Inner Mongolia after graduating in February this year. I would like to report to the conference on my study experience and ask the committee members for guidance.

　　First, more than two years of study have enabled me to consciously and voluntarily accept self-transformation. When I first entered school, I thought that I had participated in the revolution for seven or eight years, experienced various political movements, and made some progress, so there was nothing to transform. I hated the word "transformation" and liked the word "cultivation," and I opposed transformation to cultivation, thinking that "transformation" was a punishment for those who made mistakes. This wrong view seriously affected my progress.

　　In 1957, when the right-wing elements took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and the people, I could not distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. I even resonated with the right-wingers on the so-called "having a title but no power!" I had vague ideas on certain issues. For example, I also thought that the so-called "walls are built on both sides" was correct. In essence, this was a manifestation of being two-faced. I wavered in the anti-rightist struggle. In my work, I was also seriously detached from reality and the masses. If I want to do a good job in revolutionary work, I must combine it with work practice and labor practice, and consciously and voluntarily carry out fundamental self-transformation.

　　Second, how to carry out fundamental self-transformation? At first, I only kept the study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works in books. Therefore, when studying dialectical materialism, political economy, and the history of the Chinese revolution, I held the attitude of teachers lecturing and students listening, and did not properly connect with reality, correctly understand the Party's policies and guidelines, and communicate policy ideas. I did not use the arrows of Marxism-Leninism to attack my own political and ideological problems. Although I studied a lot of theory, I did not use it well. There was a change in the rectification and anti-rightist struggles. We used the absurd arguments of the right-wing elements as negative teaching materials. Aiming at the reactionary arguments of the right-wing elements, we studied documents and used Marxist-Leninist weapons to reason and fight with the right-wing elements. At the same time, in the struggle against the right-wing attack, I also unearthed my own wrong ideas and muddled views. For example, when criticizing the crimes of certain right-wing elements, it was like criticizing me. I was educated and raised my political consciousness. The most profound education for me was the movement of opening up my heart to the Party. In the movement of opening up my heart, I confessed more than 400 black thoughts to the Party. With the help and guidance of the president and teachers, and my own efforts, I analyzed and criticized them and found the guiding ideology. By confessing a large number of black materials, I was shocked. I was originally a person who climbed from the class of poor peasants and hired laborers to the reactionary ruling class, and served as a reactionary military commander, becoming a tool of the reactionary ruling class. The main problems in my political thinking were: I thought that I "had a title but no power." This was a manifestation of the reactionary warlord's "holding all power in one's hands," "acting arbitrarily," and "special concepts" in the revolutionary ranks. What I called "having a title but no power" was, in essence, the "no power" to hold all power in one's own hands and the "no power" to act arbitrarily under the system of democratic centralism. Only under the Party's patient education and sincere help did I initially realize this problem. In the past, I sometimes admitted my own shortcomings and mistakes, but I failed to completely remove the set of bourgeois anti-people and counter-revolutionary ideas from my position, viewpoint, and ideology, which inevitably contradicted the fundamental system of our country and attacked and slandered the Party's leadership and policies. These understandings were gained in the great rectification movement, through opening up my heart to the Party and the guidance of the college leadership. On this basis, I formulated a self-transformation plan and will conscientiously implement it in the future. Of course, this is only the beginning of self-transformation.

　　Third, self-criticism is a powerful weapon for fundamental self-transformation. Since recognizing the source of my mistakes, I have felt guilty and strongly demanded to correct them, and only then did I begin to consciously carry out self-criticism. In the mutual aid group, the students analyzed and criticized my reactionary thoughts, and I gained a lot. In the past, I did not treat people equally, and I criticized and taught people with the attitude of a "master," making it difficult for people to accept. When others criticized me, I had very high demands on them, and I was unwilling to accept anyone's criticism ideologically. I deeply realized that people who stand on a special reactionary position cannot use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, cannot criticize themselves, and cannot accept criticism from others. Of course, they cannot extricate themselves from the mire of mistakes and cannot make progress. The process from entering the Socialist Academy to graduation is the process of my self-transformation from unconscious to conscious and from unwilling to willing. It is also the process of my transformation from not being able to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to being able to use it.

　　Fourth, through study, I have further understood the Party, the revolution, and Marxism-Leninism, and eliminated my superstitious view of fate.

　　(1) In the past, I did not admit that there were classes in society. I climbed from the position of a poor peasant and hired laborer to the reactionary ruling class. I thought this was my good fate, so I used reactionary arguments such as "fate is determined by heaven," "great people have many difficulties," and "wealth and honor can be obtained through power" to confuse myself and confuse others, and then mistakenly thought that "the poor are all lazy people and stupid bugs, destined by fate." This is a great deception of the reactionary ruling class, and I also became a prisoner, betrayed the working people, and became an accomplice of the reactionary rulers.

　　(2) In the past, I did not admit that there was class exploitation, oppression, and class rule. I always thought that rule and oppression were not caused by classes, but by the good or bad character of certain executors. Therefore, I fantasized about "good people politics." Chiang Kai-shek was bad, but someone was not bad. I did not realize that they were "birds of a feather" of the reactionary ruling class. Although their forms of exploitation, oppression, and rule were different, the essence was no different. I used to be a reactionary military commander, a bodyguard of the reactionary ruling class. Of course, what I did was counter-revolutionary. In the past, I also mistakenly thought that the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were both parties fighting for power and profit. "The winners are kings and lords, the losers are bandits," and the victors can say whatever they want anyway. After the uprising, through study and long-term observation, and the recollection of countless facts of the reactionaries, I deeply realized my serious mistakes. Classes are objectively existing, and the reactionary ruling class must be eliminated before the working people can be liberated. The Soviet Union is like this, China is like this, and every country in the world must be like this. This is the law of social development.

　　Through studying at the Socialist Academy, I have further recognized my mistakes, and then have a new understanding of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution led by the Party. Under the wise leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have successfully completed the democratic revolution and established a new China of people's democracy. On this basis, a socialist transformation movement and an unprecedented large-scale socialist construction have been carried out throughout the country. Our country will be built into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time. This great historical mission can only be undertaken by the party of the working class, the glorious, great, and correct Chinese Communist Party, and no bourgeois party can undertake it. This can never be swayed by any subjective wishes.

　　I was born into a reactionary military officer's family. Before the uprising, I had always been an enemy of the Party and the people and had committed serious crimes. After the uprising, under the Party's unity, transformation and patient education, I have made some progress in the past few years, regretted my crimes, and recognized the truth, but I have not fundamentally transformed my thinking, changed my position, or established a working-class outlook on life. My transformation task is still long-term and arduous. Premier Zhou once again pointed out to us in the government work report: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in the long-term work practice in the future." I will resolutely follow the Premier's instructions, work hard for a long time on the road of fundamental self-transformation, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, spend more time approaching the masses, participate in physical labor, and realize fundamental self-transformation. Always go all out, aim high, and, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, contribute all my strength to the great cause of socialist construction together with the working people.

　　自觉自愿接受改造
    安春山委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我坚决地拥护周总理的政府工作报告和各位领导同志的各项报告。
    我是有生以来第一次，参加这样光荣盛大的全国人民政治协商会议和列席全国人民代表大会，亲聆我们国家领导人的报告，看见了毛主席，这是党和人民给我的光荣，使我对党和人民更加无限的感激！
    正当我们伟大祖国各项社会主义建设事业飞跃发展，各族人民的和平幸福生活在康庄大道上前进的时候，西藏一小撮上层反动分子在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的唆使和支持下，公然发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，犯下了滔天罪行。这一小撮叛乱分子，又劫走达赖喇嘛进入印度。最近，印度官员又散发了理屈词穷、破绽百出的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这就充分暴露了印度野心分子的丑恶嘴脸和阴险企图。我们正告印度干涉者，中国人民热爱和平，但是绝不是弱软可欺的。已经站立起来的中国人民，决不容许他人侵犯我们的主权，干涉我们内政，企图染指我国神圣领土，印度干涉者的阴谋企图，注定要以失败而告终。
    我是北京和平起义的旧军人。起义后党十分耐心地团结我，教育我，关怀我的进步。一九五六年并给我脱职来北京在社会主义学院学习的机会，今年二月结业回内蒙工作。我想向大会汇报一下我的学习体会，请各位委员指导。
    一，二年多的学习，使我从不自觉自愿到自觉自愿的接受自我改造。刚入学时，认为自己参加革命七、八年了，经历过历次政治运动，有了一定的进步，没有什么可改造的了，讨厌“改造”二字，高兴“培养”的字眼，把改造与培养对立起来，认为“改造”是对犯错误的人的一种惩处。这种错误看法，严重地影响了自己的进步。
    一九五七年当右派分子利用党整风的机会，向党和人民猖狂进攻的时候，我辨不清香花毒草，对所谓“有职无权”竟与右派起了共鸣！对某些问题则思想模糊，如所谓“墙是两面造的”我也认为：说的对，实质上，这是两面派的表现。在反右斗争中，摇摇摆摆。在工作当中也严重的脱离现实，脱离群众。如果愿做好革命工作，就必须结合工作实践和劳动实践，自觉自愿地进行根本的自我改造。
    二，如何进行根本的自我改造？开始时我把学习马列主义、毛主席的著作仅仅停留在书本上，所以在学习辩证唯物主义、政治经济学、中国革命史时，抱着先生讲学生听的态度，没有很好地联系实际，正确理解党的方针政策，沟通政策思想。没有用马列主义的矢，攻自己政治思想问题之的，虽学习了不少理论，但没有很好地使用。在整风和反右派斗争中，有了改变，我们以右派分子的荒谬论点，作为反面教材，针对右派分子的反动论点，学文件，以马列主义武器，同右派分子说理斗争。同时在反击右派的进攻中，也挖掘出自己的错误思想和糊涂观点。如批判某些右派分子的罪行时，就如同批判了我，受到了教育，提高了政治觉悟。对我教育最深刻的是向党交心运动。在交心运动中，向党交出了黑心四百多条，在院长、老师们的帮助指导和自己的努力下，进行分析批判，找到了主导思想。通过交出大量黑心材料，使我怵目惊心。我原来是一个从贫雇农阶级爬上反动统治阶级，并充当了反动军长，成为反动统治阶级的工具。在我政治思想上存在的主要问题是：认为自己“有职无权”。这是反动军阀的“大权独揽”、“独断独行”、“特殊观念”在革命队伍中的流露。我所谓的“有职无权”，其实质是在民主集中制度下，不允许的大权独揽，一人当家的“无权”，不能独断专行、为所欲为的“无权”。这种极大的错误和危险在党的耐心教育和真诚帮助下，才初步认识了这个问题。过去有时也承认自己的某些缺点、错误，但未能从立场、观点和思想方法上彻底去掉资产阶级反人民反革命的那一套，必然与我们国家的根本制度发生矛盾，攻击和诬蔑党的领导和方针政策。这些认识是在伟大的整风运动当中，经过向党交心和学院领导上的指导所取得的。在这个基础上制定自我改造规划，并在今后认真贯彻执行。当然，这仅仅是自我改造的开始。
    三，自我批评是自我根本改造的有力武器。自从认识了错误的所在以后，内心发生自疚，强烈地要求改正错误，才开始自觉地进行自我批判。在互助小组，同学们对我的反动思想进行了分析、批判，收获很大。在过去我是不以平等待人的，以“老爷”的态度批评人教训人，使人难于接受；而别人批评我的时候，则对人家的要求非常多，从思想上就不愿接受任何人的批评。我深深认识到：站在特殊的反动立场上的人，就不能使用批评与自我批评的武器，不能自我批判，也不能接受别人批评，当然也就不能从错误的泥坑中自拔出来，就不可能进步。从入社会主义学院到结业的过程，是我由不自觉到自觉、不自愿到自愿的自我改造的过程，也是我由不能使用批评与自我批评武器到能使用的过程。
    四，通过学习，使我进一步认识了党，认识了革命，认识了马克思列宁主义，破除了我的迷信命运观点。
    （一）过去我不承认社会上有阶级。我是由贫雇农放牛的地位爬上了反动统治阶级，认为这是我的命运好，所以就以“命由天定”、“贵人多磨难”、“富贵是可以经过势力得到”等等反动论点，迷混自己也去迷混别人，进而错误地认为“穷人都是懒汉，是笨虫，命中注定”。这是反动统治阶级的大骗局，我也成了俘虏，背叛了劳动人民，成为反动统治者的帮凶。
    （二）过去我不承认有阶级剥削、压迫和阶级统治。我一直认为统治和压迫不是因为有阶级所造成的，而是由于某些执行者人格的好坏。所以幻想过“好人政治，”蒋介石坏，但某某人还不错，没有认识到这是反动统治阶级的“一丘之貉”，他们的剥削、压迫和统治的形式尽管各有不同，本质是没有不同的。我过去是反动军长，是反动统治阶级的保镖，所做所为当然是反革命的。我过去还错误地认为中国共产党和国民党同是个争权夺利的党。“兴者王侯、败者贼”，胜利者反正是咋说咋有理。起义后，通过学习和长时期以来的观察，并对反动派无数事实的回忆，才深刻认识到我的严重错误。阶级是客观存在的，必须消灭反动统治阶级，劳动人民才能得解放。苏联如此，中国如此，世界上任何一个国家都必须如此，这是社会发展规律。
    通过在社会主义学院的学习，使我进一步认识了错误，进而对党领导的民主革命和社会主义革命有了新认识。我国各族人民在党的英明领导下，已经胜利完成了民主革命，建立了人民民主的新中国，在这个基础上在全国范围内进行了社会主义改造运动和史无前例的大规模的社会主义建设，我国将在不太长的时期内建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。这一伟大的历史使命，只有工人阶级的政党，光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党才能担当起来，而任何资产阶级政党就不可能担当。这绝不是任何主观愿望所能左右的。
    我出身于反动军官，起义前一直与党与人民为敌，罪恶甚重。起义后，在党的团结改造和耐心教育下，几年来有了一定的进步，悔悟到罪恶，认识了真理，但还没有从根本上改造思想，改变立场，还没有建立起工人阶级人生观，我的改造任务，还是长期的、艰巨的。周总理在政府工作报告中又一次给我们指出：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。”我坚决遵照总理的指示，在自我根本改造的道路上，长期努力，认真学习马列主义和毛主席著作，拿出更多的时间接近群众，参加体力劳动，实现自我根本改造。永远鼓足干劲、力争上游，在党和毛主席的正确领导下，同劳动人民一起，在社会主义建设的伟大事业中贡献出一切力量。
