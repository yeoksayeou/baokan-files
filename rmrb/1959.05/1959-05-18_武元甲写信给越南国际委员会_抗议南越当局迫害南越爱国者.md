Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 16th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote a letter to Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, on May 14th regarding the recent issuance of "Decree No. 10/59" (formerly known as "Decree No. 91") by the South Vietnamese authorities. In his letter, General Vo Nguyen Giap requested the International Commission to instruct the South Vietnamese authorities to abolish this decree and the "Special Military Tribunal" established under it.

The letter from General Vo Nguyen Giap was released by Nguyen Van Vinh, Deputy Minister of National Defense of Vietnam, at a press conference held this afternoon.

In his letter, General Vo Nguyen Giap requested the International Commission of Vietnam to pay special attention to the fact that this decree seriously violates the Geneva Accords. He pointed out that the provisions of this decree infringe upon the most basic human rights. It is formulated against former resistance personnel and patriots in South Vietnam. General Vo Nguyen Giap said that the "Final Declaration" of the Geneva Conference and the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam stipulated that the democratic freedoms of those who had cooperated with the other side must be guaranteed, and that they must not be discriminated against. However, the aforementioned decree grossly violates these provisions.

In his letter, General Vo Nguyen Giap listed the large number of facts of past killings of South Vietnamese patriots by the South Vietnamese authorities. He pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is currently using this decree to kill patriots and peace-loving people on a larger scale.

General Vo Nguyen Giap concluded by saying that the atrocities committed by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique can never frustrate the will of the South Vietnamese people to fight. For the sake of peace, independence, democracy, and unity, the entire Vietnamese people will strengthen their unity and resolutely struggle until victory.

    武元甲写信给越南国际委员会
    抗议南越当局迫害南越爱国者
    新华社河内16日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲大将5月14日就南越当局最近发布“第10／59号法令”（前称“第九十一号法令”）这件事写信给越南国际监察和监督委员会主席安萨里。武元甲大将在信里要求国际委员会责成南越当局取消这项法令和根据这项法令而设立的“特别军事法庭”。
    武元甲大将的信件是由越南国防部副部长阮文荣在今天下午举行的记者招待会上公布的。
    武元甲大将在信中要求越南国际委员会特别注意这项法令严重违反日内瓦协议的事实。他指出，这项法令规定的条款侵犯了最起码的人权。它是针对南越的前抗战人员和爱国者而制订的。武元甲大将说，日内瓦会议“最后宣言”和关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定都规定必须保障曾经同对方合作的人的民主自由，并且不能对他们加以歧视。但是上述法令却粗暴地违反了这些规定。
    武元甲大将在信中列举了南越当局过去大量杀害南越爱国者的事实。他指出，目前，吴庭艳集团则在利用这项法令更大规模地杀害爱国者和爱好和平的人民。
    武元甲大将最后说，吴庭艳集团干出的暴行是绝不能挫折南越人民的斗争意志的。为了和平、独立、民主和统一，全体越南人民必将日益加强团结，坚决进行斗争，直到胜利为止。
