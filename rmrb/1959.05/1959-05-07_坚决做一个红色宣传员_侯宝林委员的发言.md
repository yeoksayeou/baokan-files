Resolutely Be a Red Propagandist
Speech by Committee Member Hou Baolin

I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. After listening to Premier’s Government Work Report, we have an even clearer understanding of the achievements of our country's economic construction during the First Five-Year Plan, and the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958; we have a better understanding of the main tasks of developing the national economy this year, 1959. The clearer and more we understand, the greater our enthusiasm. I think this is the common idea of the people of the whole country. The headline of the People's Daily on April 20th said that the Premier's report is "A poem summarizing the Great Leap Forward, a bugle call encouraging another leap forward." I love these two sentences from the bottom of my heart. Quyi is known as the vanguard of literature and art, and our Quyi circles must not fail the glorious title given to us by the Party and the people. The bugle call for continuing the leap forward and another leap forward has resounded into the clouds. We must immediately mount our horses, spur our whips, hold high the red flag, and actively publicize and propagate the economic construction tasks centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and enthusiastically sing the praises of model heroes on all fronts, playing the role of a propaganda vanguard for socialism.

Quyi is just talking and singing, singing快板 [kuaiban], telling stories, singing drum songs, and performing相声 [xiangsheng]. What to sing? What to say? Sing about socialism, talk about socialism, and serve socialist construction. In the past ten years, under the leadership and care of the Party, and with the love and support of the working people, the Quyi circles have made some achievements. However, compared to the magnificent reality of our country, our achievements are really far from enough. Can we do our work more, faster, better, and more ideally? We must achieve this, and we will definitely be able to do it. There is a full basis for saying this.

Follow the Road Pointed Out by the Party

Through the great rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, and having personally seen or participated in the Great Leap Forward in production, the Quyi circles have a more concrete and profound understanding of the beloved Party and its great leading role. If we want to walk the right path, we must listen to the Party, follow the road pointed out by the Party, and not leave the leadership of the Party for a single step. Otherwise, we will definitely take detours, slanted roads, or even impassable dead ends. Taking the Quyi circles as an example, there have been many vivid facts in the past ten years that prove this truth. Whether it is a Quyi troupe or a Quyi performer, including myself, as long as they sincerely listen to the Party, they can do good work and make achievements. Whenever or in whatever work they forget the Party's instructions and teachings, there will be problems, big or small; if they are always unwilling to listen to the Party and are self-righteous, they will definitely make mistakes and cause losses. Our Quyi circles have universally recognized this truth after the rectification movement, not just verbally, but truly from the depths of our thoughts and feelings. Having such an understanding and sincerely listening to the Party is the main basis for us to be able to do our work more, faster, better, and more ideally in the future.

After the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, with the upsurge of the cultural revolution, amateur Quyi activities have become unprecedentedly active, and more and more Quyi enthusiasts have emerged among workers, peasants, and soldiers. The continuous emergence of excellent amateur Quyi authors and performers is a very gratifying phenomenon. But some professional performers do not think so. They are always worried that the amateur enthusiasts are all good, and the new forces are growing stronger and stronger, and the professionals will not be able to make a living. This is really ridiculous. After working in the countryside and undergoing labor training last year, and after touring performances in factories and mines in the Northeast, I had emotional connections with the working people, and I had closer contact with Quyi enthusiasts among them. I have a more profound understanding of the new Quyi of socialism. The more the masses love Quyi, the greater the propaganda power of Quyi, the better the conditions for professional actors to learn from the masses, and the more opportunities for tutoring. Professional Quyi actors will progress faster. This has incalculable benefits for promoting socialist construction, promoting communist ideology, and improving the level of Quyi art. The extensive love of workers, peasants, and soldiers for Quyi and their strict demands are another basis for us to do our work well in the future.

The Support of the Literary and Art Circles for Quyi

Another good situation is that comrades in the literary and art circles are more concerned about Quyi than before and have given a lot of support. In previous years, writers and artists also loved Quyi, liked to listen, but did not like to write much. Recently, the situation has changed. From the perspective of publications and literary criticism, this change can be seen. Our Quyi colleagues sincerely ask writers and artists to take care of Quyi more, not only love to listen, but also love to write. If every writer writes stories and相声 [xiangsheng] for us, and every poet writes lyrics and快板 [kuaiban] for us, then we can say that we will definitely be able to do our propaganda work better in the future.

Our Party's leadership in Quyi work has been established, strengthened, and consolidated. A large number of Quyi enthusiasts among workers, peasants, and soldiers have increased. Comrades in the literary and art circles are concerned and supportive of Quyi. It can be said that everything is ready.

Everything is ready, let's see how strong the enthusiasm is. Since the Great Leap Forward, the Quyi circles have responded to the Party's call and launched a vigorous "five-pronged movement" of "propagating, working, creating, tutoring, and studying." The enthusiasm of our team is great. I would like to talk about my own experience and opinions. Comparing enthusiasm and boosting enthusiasm depends on the work. To see how enthusiastic a Quyi actor is, we must see whether he truly plays the role of a vanguard in promoting socialism. To speak and sing about socialism well, we must never forget socialism at all times. In a word, you must first be a socialist person before you can make a socialist voice. Only then can your art truly serve socialist construction. Only then is enthusiasm true enthusiasm.

Thanks to the Party's Cultivation

I am also grateful to the Party for its day-to-day cultivation and patient education over the past ten years for being able to have such an understanding. After liberation, I carried several big burdens on my back: the burden of being a famous actor with an audience, the burden of having a high level of artistic skill, and even the burden of thinking that I was progressing. The more I carried, the heavier it became. After the National Staff and Workers Amateur Quyi Performance in 1956, I began to find problems. My art was going to fall behind the trend. The problem became more and more serious, and I felt more and more that my reputation did not match the reality. I was depressed for more than two years. Not only was the problem of improving artistic skill not solved, but I had many negative ideas. Bourgeois individualism had pushed me onto a terrible road. Thanks to the Party, which gave me the opportunity to cure my ideological problems in the rectification movement. After participating in the struggle to counterattack the Rightists in the Quyi circles, I went to Zilai Village, Cang County, for labor training. When I first arrived there, I participated in the socialist debate. In the struggle, I can say that I received a profound class education for the first time. The poor peasants' resolute struggle against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements made me suddenly realize and understand the fundamental reason why I had stagnated in art for a long time. It turned out to be a political and ideological problem, a standpoint problem. An actor cannot thoroughly transform his thinking, and he cannot truly understand what the working people love, hate, support, and oppose. Is it enough to just say that I understand it verbally? No! Literature and art cannot be faked, and相声 [xiangsheng] is no exception. I used to write相声 [xiangsheng] reflecting the life of peasants, but I could not write it well, revise it well, or even say it well myself. Only then did I find the root cause of the problem.

During the labor training period, the peasants' soaring enthusiasm and selfless labor enthusiasm gave me a great education. I only stayed in Zilai Village for a few months, and I saw the greatness of collective strength and mass wisdom. Repairing water gates, diverting water from the Yellow River to wash alkali land and plant rice fields; installing power generation equipment and generating electricity; establishing small factories and producing chemical fertilizers and cement. At this time, I thought, how small a person is in the great cause. I realized that the obstacle that prevented me from recognizing and arranging the relationship between politics and art, preventing my thinking from progressing, and thus preventing my art from improving was the stinking bag of pride and complacency, individualistic baggage.

I returned to my work post with the ideological gains from labor training and was fortunate to participate in the fourth stage of the rectification movement. The organization and comrades helped me kindly and meticulously, and I also had the determination to strike while the iron was hot. I shed all the big and small burdens, felt refreshed, got closer to the Party, and united with the comrades. I realized that the road of being both red and expert, and the road of being red through and through and deeply professional, is the only broad road. Only by making up my mind to take this road can I truly listen to the Party, rejoice and share weal and woe with the 600 million people, and naturally feel comfortable and invigorated. Then I can talk about boosting my enthusiasm.

When people are happy, they talk a lot. The vast majority of our Quyi comrades have already boosted their enthusiasm fully. Perhaps some comrades are like me, boosting their enthusiasm and striving to be the best. I hope we encourage each other and strive to be red propagandists. In this year of continuing to leap forward and leap forward again, we will do more, faster, and better work for the Party, for the people, and for socialist construction! We will respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to continue to mobilize all positive factors on the cultural and educational fronts and advance the cause of cultural revolution with practical actions, and support the Premier's Government Work Report with practical actions.

Finally, I would like to express the opinions of our Quyi circles on the Tibet issue: We fully agree with the statements made by the above representatives on the Tibet issue. Tibet is an inalienable part of China's territory. This fact cannot be denied by anyone who is still awake, unless he insists on reversing black and white and deceiving himself. But any conspiracy of the reactionaries is futile. The quelling of the rebellion in Tibet is purely China's internal affair, and any attempt by any foreigner to interfere in our internal affairs will be beaten black and blue. Here, I want to shout: Indian expansionists, wake up! Tibet has opened a new page in history, and the Tibetan people, like the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, will make significant contributions to the glorious cause of building our great motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Our Quyi circles will sing loudly for the rebirth of Tibet: sing that she is moving towards a democratic and socialist new Tibet!

### 坚决做一个红色宣传员  侯宝林委员的发言

专栏：

　　坚决做一个红色宣传员
    侯宝林委员的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的各项报告。听了总理的政府工作报告，我们对我国第一个五年计划期间的经济建设成就，对一九五八年工农业生产大跃进的伟大成就，心里头更清楚了；对今年，一九五九年发展国民经济的主要任务，心里头更明白了。越清楚，越明白，干劲就越大。我想这是全国人民的共同想法。四月二十日人民日报头条消息的标题说总理的报告是：“总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角”，我从心里头爱这两句话。曲艺号称文艺尖兵，我们曲艺界不能辜负党和人民给我们的光荣称号。继续跃进，再跃进的号角已经响入云霄，我们要立刻扳鞍上马，快马加鞭，高举红旗，积极宣传，宣传以钢煤粮棉四大指标为中心的经济建设任务，热烈地歌颂各个战线上的模范英雄，起到宣传社会主义的尖兵作用。
    曲艺就是说说唱唱，唱快板，说评书，唱大鼓，说相声。唱什么？说什么？唱社会主义，说社会主义，为社会主义建设服务。十年来，在党的领导和关怀下，在劳动人民的爱护与支持下，曲艺界做出了一些成绩。可是和我们国家的宏伟现实生活一对照，一比，我们这点成绩实实在在还差得很。我们能够不能够把工作搞得更多更快更好更理想呢？这一点，我们必须做到，也一定能够做到。这样说，是有充分根据的。
    走党指出的道路
    经过伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，又亲眼看见了或是亲身参加了生产大跃进，曲艺界对亲爱的党，和党的伟大领导作用，有了更具体更深刻的认识。要想把路走正走好，就要听党的话，走党指出的道路，一步也不能离开党的领导。否则就一定会走弯路走斜路甚至走上走不通的死路。拿曲艺界来说，十年来有许许多多活生生的事实证明了这个真理。一个曲艺班社也好，一个曲艺演员也好，当然包括我自己在内，只要真诚地听党的话，就能做得好工作，做出成绩；哪一阵，哪件工作里忘了党的指示和教导，就大小得出毛病；如果老是不愿意听党的话，自以为是，就一定得出错误，造成损失。我们曲艺界在整风运动以后普遍地认识到这个真理，不是口头上说，真是从思想感情上，从心里头有了认识。有了这样的认识，真心诚意地听党的话，这是我们今后能够把工作做得更多更快更好更理想的主要根据。
    去年工农业生产大跃进以后，随着文化革命的高潮，业余曲艺活动空前活跃，工农兵当中的曲艺爱好者越来越多了。优秀的业余曲艺作者和演员的不断涌现，是十分可喜的现象。可是有的专业演员就不这样想。他们老是担心业余爱好者里尽出好样的，新生力量越来越壮大，专业的就要吃不开了，这真是可笑之极。经过去年下放劳动锻炼，经过到东北厂矿的巡回演出，和劳动人民在感情上有了联系，和他们中间的曲艺爱好者有了更密切的交往，我才对社会主义的新曲艺有了更深刻的认识。群众越爱好曲艺，曲艺的宣传力量越大，专业演员拜群众为师的条件越好，做辅导工作的机会越多。专业曲艺演员才会进步得越快。这对宣传社会主义建设、宣传共产主义思想，对提高曲艺艺术的水平，都有说不尽的好处。工农兵对曲艺的广泛爱好，要求严格，是我们今后做好工作的又一个根据。
    文艺界对曲艺的支持
    还有一个好情况，文艺界的同志们对曲艺比以前关心得多了，给了不少支持。前些年，文学家艺术家们也很爱曲艺，爱听，却不大爱动手写。近来情况有变化，从刊物来看，从文艺评论工作来看，都可以看到这个变化。我们曲艺界的同行都诚恳地要求文学家艺术家多管曲艺的事，不仅爱听，而且爱写。如果每位作家都给我们写评书、相声，每位诗人都给我们写唱词，快板，那我们说今后一定能够把宣传工作做得更好。
    我们党在曲艺工作中的领导确立了，加强了，巩固了。工农兵中的曲艺爱好者大量增多了。文艺界的同志对曲艺关心和支持了。可以说是万事俱备。
    万事俱备，且看干劲如何。大跃进以来，曲艺界响应党的号召，开展了蓬蓬勃勃的“边宣传、边劳动、边创作、边辅导、边学习”的五边运动。我们这个队伍的干劲是大的，我想谈谈自己的体会和看法。比干劲，鼓足干劲，是要看工作的。一个曲艺演员的干劲如何，就要看他是不是真正起到宣传社会主义的尖兵作用，说社会主义，唱社会主义，要说得好，唱得好，就要时刻不忘念念不忘社会主义。一句话，你得先是一个社会主义的人，才能够发出社会主义的声音。你的艺术才能够真正地为社会主义建设服务。干劲才是真正的干劲。
    感谢党的培养
    我能够有这样一点认识，也要感谢党对自己十年如一日的培养和耐心的教育。解放以后，自己背了好几个大包袱，名演员有听众的包袱，艺术水平高的包袱，甚至自以为进步的包袱，越背越沉。一九五六年全国职工业余曲艺会演以后，开始发现有问题了。自己的艺术要跟不上大流。越来问题越严重，越觉得自己名实不符。苦闷了两年多，提高艺术水平的问题不仅得不到解决，反而有了很多消极想法。资产阶级个人主义已经把我推上了可怕的道路。感谢党，在整风运动中给了我治好思想毛病的机会。参加了反击曲艺界右派分子的斗争以后，我到沧县自来屯劳动锻炼。刚到那里，就参加了社会主义大辩论会，在斗争中我可以说第一次受到深刻的阶级教育。贫农对地、富、反、坏分子的坚决斗争，使我恍然大悟，知道了自己长时期在艺术上停滞不前的根本原因，原来是个政治思想问题，立场问题。一个演员不能彻底改造思想，就不能真正理解劳动人民爱什么，恨什么，拥护什么，反对什么。光是口头上说我理解了行不行？不行！文学艺术做不得假，说相声也不例外。以前自己写过反映农民生活的相声，写不好，改不好，连自己也说不好。我这才找到了病根儿。
    在劳动锻炼期间，农民弟兄的冲天干劲儿，忘我的劳动热情，给了我很大的教育。在自来屯呆了才几个月，我看到了集体力量和群众智慧的伟大。修水闸，引黄河的水冲洗碱地种稻田；安装发电设备，发了电；建立小型工厂，造出了化肥，造出了水泥。我这时就想，在伟大的事业当中，一个人是多么渺小。我认识到自己所以认不清、摆不好政治和艺术的关系，思想不进步，以致艺术提不高的障碍物，是骄傲自满的个人主义臭包袱。
    我带着劳动锻炼中的思想收获回到工作岗位，幸运地参加了整风运动的第四阶段。组织上和同志们亲切地细致地帮助自己，我也有个趁热打铁的决心。甩掉了大大小小的包袱，心情舒畅了，和党靠近了，和同志们团结了。认识到又红又专的道路，红透专深的道路，是唯一的康庄大道。只有下定决心走这条道路，才能做到真心听党的话，和六亿人民同欢乐共甘苦，自然而然心情舒畅了，才谈得上鼓足干劲。
    人要高兴了话就多。我们曲艺界绝大多数同志早就把干劲鼓得足足的了。也许有的同志和我一样，正在鼓足干劲，力争上游。我愿意我们互相勉励，努力做一个红色的宣传员。在今年，继续跃进再跃进的一年里，为党为人民为社会主义建设更多更快更好地做工作！用实际行动来响应党中央继续调动文教战线一切积极因素，向前推进文化革命事业的号召，用实际行动来拥护总理的政府工作报告。
    最后，我想就西藏问题表达一下我们曲艺界的意见：我们完全同意以上各位代表关于西藏问题的发言。西藏是我国领土不可分割的一部分，这个事实是任何还醒着的人所不能否认的，除非他一定要颠倒黑白，自欺欺人。但是反动派的任何阴谋都是枉费心机的。平定西藏的叛乱纯属中国内政，任何外国人的任何干涉我国内政的尝试，都将碰得鼻青脸肿。在这里，我要大喊一声：印度的扩张主义分子们，你们醒醒吧！西藏已经揭开了历史上新的一页，西藏人民也将像祖国各兄弟民族的人民一样，在中国共产党的领导下对建设我们伟大祖国的光荣事业作出重大的贡献。我们曲艺界要为西藏的新生而大声歌唱：歌唱她向着民主的社会主义的新西藏前进！
