Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 24th: The Soviet Union and Great Britain today signed a five-year trade agreement, which came into effect immediately.

The Soviet-British trade agreement communiqué pointed out that the further development of trade between the Soviet Union and Great Britain is in the interests of both parties. The two governments decided to create a foundation on which, if both parties are willing, the volume of trade can be increased year by year.

The main contents of the agreement are as follows:

The two governments hope to greatly increase the volume of trade between the two sides in the first year of the agreement's entry into force (from July 1, 1959, to June 30, 1960).

It is hoped to further increase the sale of traditional and other commodities from the Soviet Union to Great Britain (including grain, timber, non-ferrous metals, flax, etc.). Soviet foreign trade organizations will place large orders for British goods (including equipment for the chemical, paper-making and other industries).

The agreement stipulates that negotiations between the two governments on the conclusion of a trade and navigation treaty will be held no later than the first half of 1960, and this treaty will replace the provisional trade agreement of 1934.
