The great debate shattered the "finality" theory.
Licheng aggressively attacks the flowering and grain-filling stages.

    (Our report) Shandong Licheng County's people's communes have greatly broken the "finality" theory and are vigorously attacking the wheat's heading, flowering, and grain-filling stages. After the previous stage of management, the county's 350,000 mu of wheat are generally growing well. However, a "finality" argument has emerged among some cadres and the masses. Some say that the first and second-class wheat will soon head, and it is unnecessary to water or topdress, which is sufficient; others say that it doesn't matter whether the third-class seedlings are managed or not, they will be like this anyway. Therefore, the field management of wheat has been relaxed relatively universally. The county party committee analyzed this situation and believed that if this ideology is not resolved, it will inevitably affect the wheat harvest. Immediately, a telephone conference was held, and group meetings were held with the heads of the county party committee's spring production inspection groups and the commune party committee secretaries, emphasizing the strengthening of wheat field management in the later stage and including wheat field management as an important part of the inspection. Subsequently, each commune and team organized cadres and the masses to conduct debates on the topic of "Is the wheat finalized?" During the debate, each commune calculated the wheat production time, pointing out that it is a fact that the first two stages have passed well, but whether the goals of even ears, many grains, and heavy grains can be achieved depends on how well the heading, flowering, and grain-filling stages are managed.
    In order to break the "finality" theory, the members of the third team of the Dongwu Production Brigade in Ganggou Commune recalled the situation at the end of April last year. At that time, some people believed that the wheat was "finalized," but some wheat was fertilized and watered again, resulting in an increase of more than 30 catties per mu compared with those that were not fertilized or watered. Faced with these facts, some cadres and members criticized their conservative thinking. Liu Changtai, a member who originally thought that the third-class seedlings had no "hope," said: "Now it seems that the third-class seedlings get up late, and the ears and grains have not yet grown. As long as the measures are followed, production can still be increased." After breaking the "finality" theory, each commune and team generally formulated plans to continue strengthening wheat field management, rectified professional teams, and launched a battle to vigorously attack the wheat heading and flowering stage.
    At present, a campaign for late-stage wheat field management has been launched throughout the county. While ensuring that spring sowing is done well, a large army of more than 80,000 people has been put into wheat field management. According to the wheat growth in the county, watering and topdressing are generally required during the heading and flowering stage; for high-yield wheat fields, the focus should be on preventing lodging; third-class seedlings should be given more water and fertilizer to force them to upgrade; and various diseases and insect pests should be eliminated. In order to achieve this requirement, all professional teams have demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. The daily progress of topdressing in the county has increased from 3,800 mu to 10,000 mu, and wheat watering has increased from 380 mu to 7,000 mu. All 47,000 mu of third-class seedlings and 28,800 mu of spring wheat have been topdressed.

### 大辩论打破“定局论”  历城猛攻扬花灌浆关

    大辩论打破“定局论”
    历城猛攻扬花灌浆关
    本报讯　山东历城县各人民公社大破“定局论”，猛攻小麦、抽穗扬花和灌浆关。全县三十五万亩小麦经过前段管理，一般生长良好。但在部分干部、群众中产生了一种“定局”论调。有的说，一、二类小麦已将抽穗，不用浇水、追肥满可以了；有的说，三类苗管不管也就是这个样了。因此，较普遍地放松了麦田管理。县委分析了这种情况，认为这种思想不解决，必将影响小麦丰收。随即召开电话会，分片召开县委春季生产检查团团长、公社党委书记会议，强调加强麦田后期管理，并将麦田管理作为检查的重要内容。随后，各社、队以“小麦是否已定局？”为题，组织干部、群众开展了辩论。辩论中，各公社都计算了小麦生产时间，指出前两关过的很好是事实，但能不能达到穗齐、粒多、粒重，还要看抽穗扬花、灌浆关过的如何。
    为了打破“定局论”，港沟公社东梧生产大队第三队的社员们，回忆了去年4月底时的情况，当时有些人认为小麦“定局”了，但有的小麦又追了一次肥，浇了一次水，结果比未追肥、浇水的每亩增产三十多斤。在这些事实面前，有的干部、社员批判了自己的保守思想。原来认为三类苗没有“希望”的社员刘长太说：“现在看来，三类苗起身晚，穗、粒都还没长成，只要措施跟上，还是能够增产的。”在打破“定局论”之后，各社、队普遍制定了继续加强麦田管理的计划，整顿专业队伍，投入了猛攻小麦抽穗扬花关的战斗。
    目前，在全县范围内已掀起了麦田后期管理运动。在保证搞好春播的同时，八万余人的大军投入了麦田管理工作。根据该县小麦生长情况，在抽穗扬花关中一般要求进行浇水、追肥；对丰产麦田重点要作好防倒伏工作；对三类苗要偏水偏肥，迫使升级；要消灭各种病虫害。为了实现这一要求，各专业队都发挥了冲天干劲。全县追肥日进度由三千八百亩上升到一万亩，浇麦由三百八十亩上升到七千亩。四万七千亩三类苗和两万八千八百亩春麦，已全部追完肥。
