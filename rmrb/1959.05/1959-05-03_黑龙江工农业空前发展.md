Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports by Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Fuchun and Xiannian, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to strive to implement the various guidelines, policies, and work tasks proposed in the reports. I will now report on the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction in Heilongjiang Province.

	**Unprecedented High Speed of Economic Development in 1958**

In 1958, like all other parts of the country, our province achieved an unprecedented high speed of economic development. The total value of industrial and agricultural output reached 10.59 billion yuan, an increase of 73% compared to 1957. Among them, the industrial output value was 6.84 billion yuan, an increase of 88% compared to 1957, accounting for 64.6% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The annual growth rate of total industrial and agricultural output value was 7.3 times the average annual growth rate of the First Five-Year Plan.

In terms of industrial production and construction, many key projects have been put into or partially put into production with capabilities exceeding the design level, greatly strengthening the industrial production capacity and technical foundation of our province. The level of industrial technology has greatly improved, and a large number of important new products such as large generator sets, large smelting and steel rolling equipment, large machine tools, tractors, locomotives, and vehicles have been produced.

After the experience of “two participations, one reform, and three combinations” was implemented, not only the management of enterprises has been significantly improved, but also a wide and profound impact has been made on the development of productive forces and other aspects. Due to the implementation of the policy of "taking steel as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," more than 79,000 tons of iron and more than 357,000 tons of steel were produced in 1958. Since then, our province, which was "bare-handed," has begun to establish the foundation of the iron and steel industry. Our province is one of the country's important forestry bases. In 1958, 10.71 million cubic meters of timber were produced, an increase of more than 5.95 million cubic meters compared to 1957. The production of raw coal was 21.5 million tons, an increase of more than 8.23 million tons compared to 1957. Geology, transportation, electricity, light industry, chemical industry, and rural industries have also developed greatly.

In agriculture, an unprecedented bumper harvest was also achieved in 1958. The total output of grain and soybeans reached 24 billion catties, an increase of 53% compared to 1957. More than a dozen counties and cities, and more than 10 million mu of land, achieved an average yield per mu that met the 400-catties target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. The "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture" began to be systematically implemented. The amount of water conservancy construction reached 480 million cubic meters of earthwork. The amount of fertilizer applied increased by 2.7 times compared to 1957. The level of field management has been greatly improved. Considerable achievements have been made in breeding improved varieties, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, mechanized farming, and improving agricultural implements. In the autumn of 1958, a vigorous and large-scale deep plowing campaign was launched, with more than half of the sown area plowed.

The most profound and historically significant social change in 1958 was the realization of the communization of the rural people throughout the province. The past tens of thousands of agricultural cooperatives have been reorganized into 628 township-communes. The realization of people's communes in the rural areas of our province has a relatively mature ideological and organizational foundation. Counting from the time of mutual aid teams, it has been more than ten years, and from the time of running primary cooperatives in relatively large quantities, it has been five years, and after advanced cooperativization, it has been nearly three years. After the people's commune was established, it immediately demonstrated its powerful vitality in promoting the development of industry, large-scale steel production, autumn harvest, a campaign of deep plowing, water conservancy construction, and grain purchase. Due to this change in production relations, we not only saw the prospect of rural production developing on a larger scale and at a higher speed, but also saw the broad masses of peasants smiling because their lives were more secure, the broad masses of women were liberated from tedious housework, and the old, weak, and disabled laborers had a happy home; and we also saw the beautiful future of the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people and from socialism to communism.

Last winter and this spring, in accordance with the spirit of the Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we universally carried out the work of rectifying, consolidating, and improving people's communes in the vast rural areas. After several months of education, rectification, and consolidation, the people's communes in the rural areas of our province are now more consolidated.

On the basis of the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, and after a year of great leap forward, our province has been built into one of the country's important industrial bases centered on heavy industry and with modern large-scale enterprises as the backbone. The economic and cultural outlook of our province has fundamentally changed, and the old title of "Great Northern Wilderness" has disappeared forever.

1959 is a decisive year for three years of hard work, and it is also a year for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of last year's victory.

	**Fully Tap Potential, Vigorously Support the Whole Country, and Realize the 1959 Leap Forward Plan**

In order to realize the new leap forward plan, we first further publicized and implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, the principle of walking on two legs, the principle of the whole country acting as a coordinated chess game, and the principle of fully tapping potential and vigorously supporting the whole country among cadres and the masses. We grasped the leadership of the machinery industry, especially modern large factories. According to the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of generalities, we first arranged the production of key products such as rolling mills, power station equipment, mining, washing and selection equipment, and locomotives, vehicles, irrigation and drainage equipment, and forestry machinery, and mobilized the masses to overcome many difficulties in raw materials, equipment, labor shortages, and technology. At the same time, we also strengthened the leadership of steel, coal, timber, and transportation.

Secondly, we implemented the idea of seizing time, seizing initiative, ensuring quality, ensuring quantity, and ensuring safety, criticized negative and conservative ideas, and launched an in-depth red flag emulation campaign centered on technological revolution. In the first quarter, cities and counties in our province launched a red flag emulation campaign to ensure the completion of the leap forward plan this year. In the movement, the staff and workers were mobilized to carry out technological revolution and technological innovation extensively in view of the current difficulties of insufficient raw materials and equipment. According to incomplete statistics, in the first two months, employees in major cities such as Harbin, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, and Qiqihar alone put forward more than 920,000 rationalization proposals and many major inventions and creations. A prominent example is that the staff and workers of Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory in Harbin, without large sandboxes, large cranes, cupola furnaces, hanging bags, and large factories, gave full play to their infinite wisdom and soaring revolutionary spirit, adopted the combined modeling method of multiple mud cores and pits and the method of melting multiple times and casting once in a small furnace, and successfully cast a machine base weighing 18 tons, creating a "small doing big" casting method.

At present, most of the employees in the province have enthusiastically engaged in the red flag unit and red flag hand competition campaign. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the booming Great Leap Forward is overflowing everywhere. In order to make the red flag competition more extensive and in-depth, we will continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit on the current basis, and carry out a red flag competition movement between regions, factories, workshops, groups, and individuals, with the aim of realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan, and focusing on technological revolution, improving labor productivity, increasing production, practicing strict economy, and opposing waste. At the same time, we will strengthen enterprise management, further consolidate and develop the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," adhere to the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee and the system of employee representative congresses, mobilize the masses to make inventions and creations, and, on the principle of all passing through experiments and scientific identification, mobilize cadres, technicians, and employees to boldly carry out technological innovation.

	**Storing Peach Blossom Water, Digging Self-Flowing Springs, Thousands of Troops and Horses Fighting Drought**

In terms of agricultural production, according to the practice of the agricultural Great Leap Forward in 1958, it has been proven that the central link to ensuring the completion and over-completion of the agricultural production tasks in 1959 is to consistently implement the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture instructed by Chairman Mao throughout the year, strengthen farmland basic construction, and increase yield per unit area, especially since our province has a large area and a small population, and there are extensive farming, shallow plowing, rough work, and wide ridges and sparse planting habits and methods, which seriously affect the rapid increase of yield per unit area, resolutely implementing the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture is of special significance to ensuring the agricultural Great Leap Forward and fully tapping agricultural production potential. In 1959, our province made the following plans for several major indicators and basic requirements for implementing the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture: In water conservancy construction, it is required to develop to about 40% of the sown area on the basis of the existing irrigated area; increase organic fertilizer and build more soil fertilizer to realize a full fertilizer province; the deep plowing in the autumn should be carefully leveled, and efforts should be made to deeply plow the entire arable land area of the province once this year and next year; while making full use of the existing tractors, we should vigorously carry out tool reform; other seeds, close planting, plant protection, and field management will be listed as key points in different seasons and fully implemented. According to the practical experience of implementing the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture last year, in order to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, it is necessary to further strengthen political and ideological leadership and constantly carry out the struggle between two ideologies and two lines.

Another important issue to be solved to ensure the completion and over-completion of this year's agricultural production tasks is to plan and arrange rural labor forces and appropriately concentrate the focus of labor use on the agricultural front. Our province has more than 100 million mu of arable land, and only 3.5 million rural laborers, with each laborer bearing an average of more than 30 mu of land. With the increase in agricultural production targets, the amount of labor used per unit has doubled, so the serious shortage of labor is even more felt. In this regard, in addition to deciding to concentrate 85% of the existing labor force in rural areas for agricultural production, we also plan to do a good job in mobilizing women and running nurseries and canteens to mobilize more women to participate in labor and increase working days. At the same time, we mobilize surplus employees and some residents from cities to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and strive to increase the proportion of agricultural mechanization and electrification as soon as possible under possible conditions to improve agricultural labor productivity.

This year, we also encountered spring droughts that have not been seen in previous years during spring plowing and sowing. From October last year to March this year, the average precipitation in the province was 44 mm, which was 21 mm less than the same period in previous years. The temperature in all parts of the province from September last year to this year was also generally higher than in previous years, so the evaporation of water also increased accordingly. Although there have been two light rains recently, the drought has been temporarily eased in some areas, but in the western part of our province, the depth of soil moisture drought is still 5 to 10 mm. With the increase in production targets and the implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," the water demand has increased more than in previous years, which has caused the phenomenon of spring drought threatening spring sowing. In order to overcome the spring drought, we launched a mass anti-drought campaign throughout the province after the Spring Festival. Among cadres and the masses, through the methods of great contending, great blooming, and great debate, we strengthened our determination and confidence in fighting drought, and timely criticized and overcame the erroneous thoughts of some cadres and the masses who relied on the sky to wait for rain, were paralyzed and lucky, and lacked confidence, established the idea that man will conquer nature, and aroused the enthusiasm of the masses to fight drought. On the basis of the water conservancy projects that have been built, all localities have further organized the masses to find sources, intercept flows, and store all the peach blossom water that can be stored, actively dig self-flowing springs, and build water conservancy projects, especially strengthening the work of land preparation and moisture preservation. The province invested labor in land preparation and moisture preservation, pulling ice and transporting snow, and carrying out spring irrigation, which once reached more than 600,000 people. The area of land preparation completed in the province has reached more than 42.6 million mu. From last winter to now, the cumulative completion of earth and stone work has reached more than 276 million cubic meters, and the area of water conservancy projects has increased by 6.73 million mu. Due to the development of a mass anti-drought campaign, it has not only had a certain effect on overcoming the spring drought, but also promoted the development of water conservancy construction.

	**Actively Develop Diversified Agricultural Operations, Develop Light Industry and Chemical Industry, Produce Agricultural Production Materials, Catch Up with the Needs of Heavy Industrial Urban Development and Improve People's Lives**

Heilongjiang Province is a heavy industrial base centered on machinery, steel, coal, and timber. The urban population has reached about 6 million. Due to the rich resources, convenient transportation, and the needs of the country, these heavy industries will continue to develop in large quantities, and the urban population will inevitably continue to increase. This brings a new and major problem: the development of agriculture and light industry must keep up, otherwise there will be a situation where the proportional relationship between the development of industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry is not adapted. This situation has already emerged in Heilongjiang Province: Because there is very little light industry in the province, and in the past, light industrial products mainly relied on the supply of Shanghai and Tianjin, the supply of daily necessities in the market is now very tight due to the reduction of goods coming in, and even production is affected in forest areas and mining areas due to the lack of rubber shoes. In agriculture, although our province has had surplus grain for several years, it cannot guarantee harvests regardless of drought or flood due to the lack of water conservancy and farmland basic construction; and it cannot further refine and cultivate due to the lack of labor and mechanization. If this situation can be tolerated before the urban population has not increased significantly and the rural population has not decreased significantly (because industrial labor mainly comes from rural areas), then when the situation changes, it will cause great difficulties in the development of heavy industry and people's lives. It is said that the urban population in the United Kingdom accounts for 87.9% of the national population, and all food and non-staple food rely on foreign imports. If the business is done well, there is food to eat, and if it is not done well, there is no food to eat. This kind of abnormal development is not surprising in capitalist countries, but it can be completely avoided in socialist countries. Therefore, we are now taking the spirit of planning ahead, and in accordance with the central government's policy of several simultaneous development, in addition to continuing to step up farmland basic construction and water conservancy projects and accelerate agricultural mechanization, we are taking the following measures: First, actively develop diversified agricultural operations. First of all, in terms of planning arrangements, we have made overall arrangements for the contradictions in labor, funds, and arable land that exist between the development of food crop production and the development of diversified operations and the expansion of non-staple food production, stipulated a certain ratio, and signed production and sales contracts with rural people's communes to establish a base for expanding diversified operations. Secondly, in terms of state-owned farms, we have expanded the proportion of diversified operations, stipulated the task of handing in non-staple food, and launched a campaign to vigorously produce non-staple food in government agencies, enterprises, troops, and schools. Many enterprises have established small farms and breeding farms in the suburbs and nearby rural areas, mainly to produce non-staple food. At the same time, we have also taken measures to encourage members of agricultural cooperatives to raise some pigs, chickens, ducks, and other small livestock at home, and left a small amount of garden land for members of rural people's communes.

Secondly, we have grasped the production and construction of light industry and chemical industry. According to the principle of "adapting to local conditions and everyone doing it" and the situation of funds, raw materials, and consumption needs, we have arranged the production of light and chemical industries, especially daily industrial products. This year, in addition to planning to build and expand a number of new light industrial factories and organizing some transferred light industrial factories to return to the team, the province also plans to help people's communes develop light industrial production through contracts, so that some daily industrial products will gradually shift from mainly relying on the supply of large and medium-sized cities to obtaining materials locally, producing locally, and supplying locally.

Third, through the method of cooperation between industry and commerce, we actively promote the production of agricultural production materials and create conditions for gradually realizing the industrialization, mechanization, and electrification of people's communes.

At the same time, we have also strengthened the procurement work within and outside the province, arranged the market, and guided the leadership of consumption and market management.

The industrial and agricultural production of Heilongjiang Province bears the great task of supporting the whole country. In 1959, we will support the whole country with 85% of the power generation equipment, 65% of the coal washing equipment, 84.6% of the timber, as well as a large amount of coal, steel, various machinery, machine-made paper, sugar, flax, etc. Every year, we also take out a large amount of grain, meat, and eggs to support the whole country. In the past, our vegetables were supported by others. Last year, we can not only be self-sufficient in vegetables, but also began to support others. We deeply know that our task of supporting the whole country is glorious and arduous. We must conscientiously do a better job in all aspects of production in 1959 and use more things to support the whole country.

	**We Warn Indian Expansionists That Today's China Is Not the China of the Past. Whoever Wants to Reach Out and Bully China Will Have His Fingers Cut Off**

Finally, on behalf of the 16 million people of Heilongjiang Province, I express my great indignation at the traitorous incident of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet and the collusion between British imperialism and Indian expansionists to conspire to split our Tibet and interfere in China's internal affairs. We want to warn Indian expansionists to make it clear that today's China is not the China of the past. Whoever wants to reach out and bully China will have his fingers cut off. Didn't the United States have its fingers cut off when it reached out in Korea? To tell the truth, India should only prevent American and British imperialism from reaching out to itself today, and should not reach out to others. China and India have been bullied by imperialism in the past. We should unite well to jointly deal with various conspiracies, sabotage, and aggression by imperialism. Don't fall for the old tricks of American and British imperialism and turn the spearhead of struggle towards the inside of the national independence movement, because doing so can only benefit imperialism, and it is not beneficial to the national independence movement against imperialist oppression, and it is not beneficial to India. I hope that Indian expansionists will clear their heads and take back your hand that interferes in China's internal affairs. It is best to extradite the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet who are frantically carrying out reactionary activities in India to the Chinese government for handling, and stop all activities that interfere in China's internal affairs, to show your cherishing of Sino-Indian friendship and your determination to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. What you choose is up to you. Please think again and again!

### 黑龙江工农业空前发展

    黑龙江工农业空前发展
    李范五代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理和富春、先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并坚决为贯彻执行报告中所提出的各项方针政策和工作任务而努力奋斗。现在我就黑龙江省工、农业生产建设发展的情况，作如下汇报。
      一九五八年在经济发展上创造了空前的高速度
    一九五八年，我省也同全国各地一样，在经济发展上创造了空前的高速度。工农业总产值达到一百零五点九亿元，比一九五七年提高了百分之七十三。其中工业产值六十八点四亿元，比一九五七年提高了百分之八十八，占工农业总产值的百分之六十四点六。一年的工农业总产值的增长速度为第一个五年计划每年平均增长速度的七点三倍。
    在工业生产建设方面，许多重点项目，都以超过设计水平的能力投入或部分投入了生产，大大壮大了我省工业生产的能力和技术基础。工业技术水平有很大提高，生产了各种大型发电机组、大型冶炼和轧钢设备、大型机床、拖拉机、机车车辆、汽车等大量的重要新产品。
  “两参一改三结合”的经验推行后，不仅使企业的管理面貌有了显著改观，而且对生产力的发展和其他方面也发生了广泛深刻的影响。由于贯彻执行了“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，一九五八年生产铁七万九千多吨，钢三十五万七千多吨。从此使我们这个“手无寸铁”的省份开始建立了钢铁工业的基础。我省是国家重要林业基地之一，一九五八年生产了一千零七十一万立方公尺木材，比一九五七年增产了五百九十五万余立方公尺。生产原煤二千一百五十万吨，较一九五七年增产了八百二十三万多吨。地质、交通、电力、轻工、化工以及农村工业等也都有很大的发展。
    在农业方面，一九五八年也取得了空前的大丰收。粮食和大豆总产量达到了二百四十亿斤，比一九五七年增长了百分之五十三。并有十多个县、市，一千多万亩土地，平均亩产达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的四百斤指标。“农业八字宪法”开始系统推行，水利建设工程量达四亿八千万土方，施肥量比一九五七年提高了二点七倍，田间管理的水平有很大提高，繁育良种、防治病虫害、机耕和改良农具等都取得了不少的成绩。一九五八年秋又空前地开展了轰轰烈烈的深翻地运动，翻地超过了播种面积的半数以上。
    一九五八年最深刻的、有历史意义的社会变化是全省农村人民公社化的实现。过去上万个农业社已组成为六百二十八个乡社合一的人民公社。我省农村实现人民公社化有比较成熟的思想基础和组织基础。从互助组时算起，已有十多年历史，从比较大量的办初级社时算起，已有五年的历史，高级合作化后，已有将近三年的历史。人民公社建成以后，立即在推动发展工业、大搞钢铁、秋收、突击深翻地、兴修水利、征购粮等运动中，显示了它强大的生命力。由于生产关系的这种变革，使我们既看到了农村生产以更大规模和更高速度向前发展的前景；看到了广大农民因为生活更有保障，广大妇女因为从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，老弱残疾劳动者因为得到了幸福归宿，而笑逐颜开；而且看到了由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制和由社会主义过渡到共产主义的美好未来。
    去冬今春，我们根据党中央八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议精神，在广大农村中普遍开展了整顿巩固提高人民公社的工作。经过几个月的教育、整顿和巩固过程，现在我省农村人民公社更加巩固了。
    在第一个五年计划建设基础上，又经过一年来的大跃进，我省已经建成为国家的以重工业为中心，以现代化大型企业为骨干的重要工业基地之一，我省经济、文化面貌已根本改观，“北大荒”这个旧有的称号已经一去不复返了。
    一九五九年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，也是在去年胜利的基础上，实现更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年。
    充分挖潜力，大力支援全国，实现一九五九年跃进计划
    为了实现新的跃进计划，我们首先在干部与群众中进一步宣传、贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线、一套两条腿走路、全国一盘棋和充分挖掘潜力、大力支援全国的方针。抓紧了对机械工业特别是现代化大厂的领导，依据保证重点、照顾一般的原则，首先安排了轧钢机、电站设备、矿山、洗选设备和机车车辆、排灌设备及森工机械等重点产品的生产，发动群众克服了许多原材料、设备、劳力不足和技术上的难关。与此同时还加强了钢铁、煤炭、木材与交通运输工作的领导。
    其次，贯彻了争时间、争主动、保质、保量、保安全的思想，批判了消极保守思想，深入开展了以技术革命为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动。在第一季度内我省各市、县，为了保证今年跃进计划的完成，都开展了实现首季满堂红的红旗竞赛运动。在运动中发动职工针对当前原材料、设备不足的困难，广泛的进行了技术革命与技术革新。据不完全统计，仅在哈尔滨、牡丹江、佳木斯、齐齐哈尔等几个大城市，在一、二月份职工即提出九十二万多条合理化建议和许多重大的发明创造。较突出的如哈尔滨市祥太内燃机厂职工在没有大型砂箱、大型吊车、冲天炉、吊包、大型厂房的条件下，发挥了无穷的智慧和冲天的革命干劲，采用多泥芯块和池坑联合造型法和小炉多次熔化一次浇铸的方法，成功地铸造了重达十八吨的机底座，创造了“小干大”铸造法。
    目前全省职工大部分已热火朝天地投入了红旗单位和红旗手的竞赛运动。蓬蓬勃勃的大跃进的革命干劲，到处洋溢着。为了使红旗竞赛更加广泛深入地开展起来，我们将在现在的基础上，继续发扬革命干劲，在地区与地区、厂与厂、车间与车间、小组与小组以及个人之间开展一个以实现更大、更好、更全面跃进计划为目的，以技术革命、提高劳动生产率、增加生产、厉行节约、反对浪费为中心环节的红旗竞赛运动。同时加强企业管理，进一步巩固发展“两参一改三结合”的经验，坚持党委领导下的厂长负责制和职工代表大会制，发动群众进行发明创造，在一切经过试验和科学鉴定的原则下，发动干部、技术人员、职工大胆的进行技术革新。
    蓄下桃花水、挖掘自流泉，千军万马抗干旱
    在农业生产方面，根据一九五八年农业大跃进的实践，证明了保证完成和超额完成一九五九年的农业生产任务的中心环节，就是要全年一贯地贯彻执行毛主席指示的农业八字宪法，加强农田基本建设工作，提高单位面积产量，特别是由于我省地多人少和存在着广种薄收、浅耕粗作、宽垅稀植的耕作习惯和方法，严重的影响单位面积产量迅速提高的情况下，坚决贯彻农业八字宪法，对保证农业大跃进、充分挖掘农业生产潜力，就更有重要的特殊意义。一九五九年我省对贯彻执行农业八字宪法的几项主要指标和基本要求作了如下规划：在水利建设上，要求在已有灌溉面积的基础上，发展到占播种面积百分之四十左右；增多有机肥料、大造土化肥，实现满肥省；要把去秋深翻地认真进行平整，并争取在今年和明年内把全省耕地面积全部深翻一遍；要在充分使用好现有拖拉机的同时，大力进行工具改革；其他种籽、密植、植物保护和田间管理等将在不同季节里，分别列为重点，全面加以贯彻。根据去年贯彻农业八字宪法的实际经验，为要保证农业八字宪法的全面贯彻，必须进一步加强政治思想领导不断地进行两种思想两条路线的斗争。
    保证完成和超额完成今年农业生产任务，要解决的另一个重要问题，就是要把农村劳动力进行规划、安排，把劳动力使用的重点适当地集中到农业战线上来。我省耕地达一亿多亩，农村劳动力只有三百五十万个，每个劳动力平均负担三十多亩土地。随着农业生产指标的增长，单位用工量倍增，因此更感劳动力严重不足。对此，我们除决定把农村现有的劳动力的百分之八十五集中进行农业生产外，还计划做好发动妇女、办好托儿所、食堂等工作，以便动员更多的妇女参加劳动，增加工作日，同时从城市中动员企业多余的职工及一部分居民下乡参加农业生产，并在可能条件下，争取尽快的增长农业机械化、电气化的比重，以提高农业劳动生产率。
    今年我们在备耕春播中，还遇到了历年所没有的春旱现象。从去年十月到今年三月统计，全省平均降水量为四十四公厘，比历年同时期减少二十一公厘。而全省各地气温从去年九月到今年又普遍高于历年，因之水分蒸发也随之增大。最近虽然连降两次小雨，旱象在部分地区暂时有所缓和，但我省西部地区，土壤水分干旱深度仍达五至十公厘。而随着生产指标的增加、“八字宪法”的贯彻，需水量又较历年都增多，这就造成了春旱威胁春播的现象。为战胜春旱，我们在春节以后，就在全省范围内掀起了群众性的抗旱运动。在干部和群众中，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法，坚定了对抗旱的决心和信心，及时批判和克服了某些干部和群众的靠天等雨、麻痹侥幸和信心不足等错误思想，树立了人定胜天的思想，鼓起了群众的抗旱劲头。各地在已兴修的水利基础上，进一步组织群众千方百计地找源截流，拦蓄了一切可蓄的桃花水，积极地挖掘了自流泉和兴修了水利，特别是加强了整地保墒工作。全省投入整地保墒、拉冰运雪、进行春灌的劳力，曾经达到六十多万人。全省整地面积已完成四千二百六十余万亩。从去冬到现在累计已完成土石方二亿七千六百余万公方，增加水利工程面积六百七十三万亩。由于开展了群众性的抗旱运动，不仅对于战胜春旱有了一定效果，而且促进了水利建设事业的发展。
    积极发展农业多种经营，发展轻工业和化学工业，生产农业生产资料，赶上重工业城市发展和提高人民生活的需要
    黑龙江省是一个以机械、钢铁、煤炭、木材为中心的重工业基地，城市人口已达六百万左右，由于这里的资源丰富、交通便利和国家的需要，这些重工业将继续大量发展，城市人口也必将继续增加。这就带来一个新的重大问题，就是农业和轻工业的发展必须跟上来，否则就会发生工业与农业、重工业与轻工业发展比例关系不相适应的情况。现在这种情况，在黑龙江省已经露头了：由于本省轻工业很少，过去轻工业品主要靠上海、天津供应，现在来货减少，使市场日用百货供应很紧，在林区、矿区甚至因缺胶鞋等而影响生产。在农业方面，虽然我省几年来粮食都有多余，但因缺乏水利及农田基本建设，而不能旱涝保收；因缺乏劳力又未机械化而不能进一步精耕细作。这种情况如果说在城市人口未大量增加、乡村人口未大量减少（因工业劳力主要是从农村来的）之前，还可以过得去的话，那么当情况变化之后，就会使重工业的发展和人民生活发生极大困难。据说英国城市人口占全国人口百分之八十七点九，粮食、副食品全靠外国进口，生意做好了就有饭吃，做不好就没饭吃。这种畸形发展在资本主义国家不足为怪，在社会主义国家是完全可以避免的。因此，我们现在正本着未雨绸缪的精神，本着中央关于几个并举的方针，我们除继续加紧进行农田基本建设和水利工程以及加速农业机械化以外，正在采取如下措施：第一，积极的发展农业的多种经营。首先在计划安排上，我们对发展粮食作物的生产和发展多种经营、扩大副食品生产之间存在的劳力、资金、耕地等方面争嘴的矛盾，做了统筹安排，规定了一定比例，并与农村人民公社签订了产销合同，建立了扩大多种经营的基地。其次在国营农场方面，扩大了多种经营的比例，规定了上缴副食品任务，并在机关、企业、部队、学校中开展了大搞副食品生产的运动，不少企业已在郊区和附近的农村举办了以生产副食品为主的小型农场和饲养场。与此同时还采取了鼓励农业社员家庭饲养一部分猪、鸡、鸭等小家畜的措施，给农村人民公社社员每人留了少量的园田地。
    第二，抓紧了轻工业和化学工业的生产建设。依据“因地制宜，大家动手”的方针和资金、原材料、消费需要的情况，安排了轻、化工业特别是日用工业品的生产。全省今年除计划新建和扩建一批轻工业工厂、组织一部分转业的轻工业工厂归队外，还计划通过合同形式帮助人民公社发展轻工业生产，使一部分日用工业品逐步由过去的主要依靠大中城市供给转向就地取材，就地生产，就地供应。
    第三，通过工商协作的办法，积极促进农业生产资料的生产，并为逐步实现人民公社工业化，农业机械化，电气化创造条件。
    与此同时还加强了省内、省外的采购工作，安排市场，指导消费与市场管理工作的领导。
    黑龙江省的工业和农业生产，是担负着支援全国的巨大任务的，一九五九年我们将以占产量的百分之八十五的发电设备、百分之六十五的洗煤设备、百分之八十四点六的木材，以及大量的煤炭、钢材、各种机械、机制纸、食糖、亚麻布等支援全国，我们每年也拿出大量粮食、肉、蛋支援全国，过去我们的菜蔬是靠人支援的，去年我们在菜蔬方面不仅可以自给，而且开始支援别人了。我们深深知道我们支援全国任务是光荣而繁重的，我们一定要兢兢业业把一九五九年各项生产搞得更好，用更多的东西来支援全国。
    我们警告印度扩张主义者，今日的中国已不是过去的中国了，谁想伸手欺负中国，谁的手指头就会被打掉
    最后，我代表黑龙江省一千六百万人民对西藏上层反动分子举行叛国事件，对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义者狼狈为奸，阴谋分裂我国西藏，干涉中国内政的行为表示极大愤慨。我们要警告印度扩张主义者，要弄清楚：今日的中国已不是过去的中国了，谁想伸手欺负中国，谁的手指头就会被打掉，美国不是在朝鲜一伸手就被打掉了手指头吗？说老实话，印度今天只应防止美英帝国主义向自己伸手而不应向别人伸手。中国和印度过去都是受帝国主义欺负的，我们应该好好团结起来共同对付帝国主义的各种阴谋破坏和侵略行为，不要上美英帝国主义的老当，把斗争的矛头转向民族独立运动的内部，因为那样做只能对帝国主义有利，而对反帝国主义压迫的民族独立运动不利，对印度不利。希望印度扩张主义者把头脑清醒一下吧，把你那干涉中国内政的手拿回去吧。最好把正在印度疯狂进行反动活动的西藏上层反动分子引渡给中国政府处理，并且停止一切干涉中国内政的活动，以表示你们珍视中印友好，和执行和平共处五项原则的决心。究何自取，望再三思！
