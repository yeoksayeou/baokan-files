Self-Remolding of Democratic Party Members
Speech by Representative Zhang Tianfang

　　Chairman, fellow representatives:

　　After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I received a profoundly deep and realistic education in socialism and communism. I feel boundless excitement and emotion in my heart, and I express my complete support and resolute implementation in my work.

　　In order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward and successfully complete the 1959 National Economic Plan, it is essential that the democratic parties, as the political representatives of the bourgeoisie, undergo a comprehensive socialist transformation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Now I would like to express some personal understandings on this issue:

　　Further recognize the repetitiveness, arduousness, and long-term nature of self-remolding, honestly accept remolding, and strengthen remolding through active service.

　　The Yunnan Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (Minge), one of the democratic parties, after experiencing the anti-Rightist struggle and the general rectification movement, on the one hand, defeated and isolated the Rightists, and on the other hand, provided a profound education for the vast majority of centrists. Everyone unanimously recognized that they were bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals and that they had two sides. They also understood what Premier Zhou said in his Government Work Report at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress: "What the broad masses of the people expect from the democratic parties is to firmly stand on the socialist position, pay attention to ideological remolding, and give full play to their positive role in national life." They expressed their willingness to accept remolding. Through the practice of going to the countryside for rectification, labor service, and three-way combination last year, they earnestly learned from the working people, recognized the glory of labor and the shame of exploitation, and initially established ideological feelings with the working people. Most people are able to accept remolding more consciously, which is a great progress. However, one should have a realistic assessment of one's own degree of progress. Overestimating or underestimating is inappropriate. Overestimation will lead to blind complacency and hinder ideological remolding. Some might think, "The issue of standpoint has been basically resolved, and there is no need for remolding," or "At most, another six months or a year of remolding will be enough to meet the six political criteria." If one cannot see progress, one will also lose confidence in remolding. Naturally, one will not be able to play a positive role in the socialist cause. Therefore, it is necessary to further recognize the repetitiveness, arduousness, and long-term nature of self-remolding, this objective law, in order to truly understand that not only is remolding necessary, but long-term remolding is also required. Because people's ideology is constantly changing under the influence of external objective things, and objective things are constantly developing. When one problem is clarified, another problem arises. New things are constantly emerging, and new problems are constantly arising. In each problem, there is the issue of standpoint, and therefore it is necessary to remold oneself through repeated practice. Chairman Mao explained this principle very clearly in "On Practice." Once we recognize that we have two sides and grasp the laws of self-remolding, we will honestly accept remolding. Now, the international situation is that the East wind is gradually prevailing over the West wind, the economic foundation of the domestic bourgeoisie has been eliminated, and there is a powerful people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, as well as the Party's correct united front policy. These are the most favorable objective conditions. The only question is whether we can consciously and earnestly carry out remolding. Therefore, in light of the current situation, we should make a realistic assessment of our political standpoint and constantly improve our awareness of self-remolding. This is very necessary.

　　In the current great leap forward in socialist construction, every member of the Minge must strive to serve socialism; in actively serving, strengthen remolding; and on the basis of strengthening remolding, better serve socialism. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to resolutely implement the policy of taking political and ideological education as the commander, the work post as the base, and labor practice and professional practice as the foundation, and closely combine the three. Combining remolding with service, and remolding oneself in service, this is a dialectical relationship that is complementary and mutually reinforcing. This is the only correct policy for us to carry out self-remolding. A person's political standpoint is reflected through specific problems; the improvement of one's understanding cannot be solved solely by studying theory, but must be achieved through repeated practice. Chairman Mao explained this principle very clearly in "On Practice." Lenin also said: "Bourgeois scientists accept Marxism through their professional practice." This is the issue of combining theory with practice, politics with profession. We must closely combine politics and profession, remolding and service. Through professional practice, we should carry out the struggle between two roads, two methods, and two worldviews, and constantly correct our standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of observing and handling problems. Only by working hard and doing more work can we discover more problems in our standpoint and thinking in the practice of transforming the objective world. Through the help and education of the Party and the masses, we can solve them. Only in this way can we practice with a correct standpoint and viewpoint, exert great effort, strive for the top, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and contribute more to the cause of socialist construction. Since the anti-Rightist rectification movement, our Yunnan Minge and other democratic parties have responded to the Party's call and actively engaged in the agricultural labor front and the great steelmaking campaign, achieving certain results. Everyone has been tempered and improved to varying degrees. However, there are also some incorrect ideas. For example, some people think that once they participate in physical labor, they no longer need to carry out political standpoint and ideological remolding. Physical labor is the fundamental way for us to remold ourselves, but participating in labor does not mean that our ideological standpoint has been fundamentally remolded. In labor, we must take political and ideological education as the commander in order to consciously elevate our experiences in labor practice to the level of reason through political study and consolidate our understanding. At the same time, through political study, we can master the correct ideological weapons to criticize the bourgeois standpoint and ideology manifested in labor, and further promote the remolding of political ideology. Therefore, in labor practice, only by implementing the policy of taking political and ideological education as the commander can we effectively remold ourselves. Professional practice is the same. Without attaching importance to the study of political theory and mastering ideological weapons, it is unimaginable to hope to do a good job with the correct standpoint, viewpoint, and method. This shows that bourgeois elements and their intellectuals must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, and use correct theory to guide practice in order to correctly remold their standpoint and thinking, and to do a good job and actively serve socialism.

　　Yunnan Minge members, like Minge members in other regions, must continue to carry out the fundamental remolding of their political standpoint and strive to serve socialism. This is a definite and unchangeable policy. The question now is how to more effectively implement this policy. After the anti-Rightist rectification movement, we should further use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to improve ourselves. Here are two points to discuss:

　　Two points of opinion on carrying out criticism:

　　(1) The combination of encouragement and criticism. It is necessary to use encouragement and criticism in ideological remolding, because the characteristics of bourgeois elements and their intellectuals are two-sided. In the process of carrying out standpoint and ideological remolding, we should encourage its positive aspects and criticize its negative aspects. In order to overcome shortcomings, transform negativity into positivity, and give play to its positive forces, we must go through ideological struggle, and criticism and self-criticism are the weapons of ideological struggle. Abandoning this weapon means not engaging in ideological remolding. Of course, it is wrong to only see the negative aspects and not see the positive aspects; but if the encouragement for a person exceeds the proper limits, it will make the other party produce blind complacency and hinder progress. In our conduct, we must especially prevent this tendency of being unable to carry out criticism. We must have an appropriate assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of a comrade in order to correctly implement the policy of encouragement and criticism.

　　(2) The method of criticism and self-criticism is needed with gentle breezes and fine rain, but it is certain that there will be wind and rain. The purpose of doing this is to make everyone willing to open up their minds and truly solve problems through debate. After the anti-Rightist rectification movement, most members are able to open up their minds; but a few people are afraid of making mistakes and are not open-minded enough. There are many reasons for this phenomenon: some are due to not distinguishing the different nature of the two types of contradictions, not recognizing that Rightists are an objective reality, and mistakenly believing that some people become Rightists because of talking too much, "too many words lead to mistakes," and it is better to "keep one's mouth shut" so as not to make mistakes; others are afraid of being criticized after talking about their true thoughts. The latter situation shows that some people still lack a correct understanding of self-remolding. Our method of using the weapon of criticism has always been to patiently present the facts and reason things out, so that the other party is convinced both in mind and in words, and to prevent adopting a simplified method that is not persuasion but coercion; but some people even use "gentle breezes and fine rain" as an excuse to try to escape remolding, which is seriously wrong. In short, we should be good at distinguishing problems and treating them differently, so that they can go from being unconscious to completely conscious. The progress of remolding will also be accelerated accordingly, and the enthusiasm for serving socialism will also be increased accordingly.

　　Fellow representatives: After the anti-Rightist rectification movement, the ideological understanding of the Yunnan Minge members has been improved to varying degrees. In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we must further unite our members and the masses we are connected with to actively serve socialism. We must thoroughly abandon the capitalist standpoint, firmly stand on the socialist standpoint, strengthen self-remolding, continue to consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front, and contribute all our strength to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the 1959 National Economic Plan.

　　In addition, a handful of reactionary upper-class elements in Tibet, colluding with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, sabotaged the unity of the motherland and launched an armed rebellion. Our government sternly condemned them and wiped them out in one fell swoop, allowing the Tibetan monks, nuns and lay people to embark on a new stage of building a happy life. The people of the whole country are jubilant. However, the interventionist elements in India dared to take the opportunity to incite and provoke, even calling Tibet a "country," encouraging Tibetans to drive away the Han people, and even organizing demonstrations and conspiracies to insult the statue of our great leader Chairman Mao. This is tolerable, but what is intolerable! Tibet is an inalienable and sacred part of China's territory, and we will never allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs. We warn the interventionist elements in India to quickly rein in their horses and turn back to the shore, otherwise they will surely suffer a bloody end.

　　There are many errors in the above speech, please give criticisms.

### 民主党派成员的自我改造  张天放代表的发言

专栏：

　　民主党派成员的自我改造
    张天放代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，使我受到一次极为深刻而现实的社会主义和共产主义的教育，内心感到无限的兴奋和激动，我表示完全拥护并在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    为了更大更好更全面的跃进，胜利完成一九五九年的国民经济计划，作为资产阶级的政治代表的民主党派，在中国共产党的领导下，全面接受社会主义的根本改造，是首要的问题。现在我就这个问题发表一些个人的认识：
    进一步认识自我改造的反复性、艰巨性、长期性，老老实实地接受改造，在积极服务中加强改造
    民主党派成员之一的云南民革，经历了反右派斗争和一般整风运动以后，一方面打垮和孤立了右派，另一方面使占绝大多数的中间派受到了一次深刻的教育，大家一致认识了自己是资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，认识了自己有两面性；也体会了周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上所作的政府工作报告中说的：“广大人民所希望于各民主党派的就是坚定地站在社会主义立场上，注意进行思想改造，以充分发挥他们在国家生活中的积极作用。”表示愿意接受改造。通过去年下乡整风劳动服务三结合的实践，认真向劳动人民学习，认识了劳动的光荣，剥削的可耻，与劳动人民初步建立了思想感情，多数的人是能够较自觉的接受改造了，这是一个很大的进步；但对自己的进步程度，应有实事求是的估计。估计过高或过低，都是不恰当的。估计过高，就会产生盲目自满，不利于思想改造。有些就会这样想：“立场问题已基本上解决，不需要改造了。”或“最多再改造半年一年，就可以符合六项政治标准了。”如果看不到进步，也会对改造丧失信心，自然对社会主义事业，就不能发挥积极服务的作用。所以必须进一步认识自我改造的反复性、艰巨性、长期性，这一客观规律，才能真正理解不仅需要改造，而且需要长期的改造。因为人的思想意识，不断受外界客观事物的影响而起变化，而客观事物是不断发展的。这个问题弄清楚了，那个问题又出来了。新事物不断出现，新的问题不断产生。每个问题当中，都有立场问题，因而也就需要通过反复不断的实践，来改造自己，这就是我们思想改造的反复性、艰巨性和长期性，立场问题是客观存在的，认识了自己还有两面性，掌握了自我改造的规律，才会老老实实接受改造。现在国际形势是东风步步压倒西风，国内资产阶级的经济基础已经消灭，有了强大的工人阶级领导的人民民主专政，有党的正确的统一战线政策，这些都是最有利的客观条件，问题只在我们是否能自觉的认真进行改造。因此针对当前情况，我们应当对自己的政治立场，作一番实事求是的估计，不断提高自我改造的自觉性，这是非常必要的。
    在当前社会主义建设的大跃进中，每一个民革成员，都必须努力为社会主义服务；在积极服务中，加强改造，在加强改造的基础上，更好的为社会主义服务。为了达到这个目的，必须在中国共产党的领导下，坚决贯彻以政治思想教育为统帅，以工作岗位为基地，以劳动实践和业务实践为基础，三者紧密结合起来的方针。改造与服务相结合，在服务中改造自己，这是相辅相成，互相推动的辩证关系，是我们进行自我改造唯一正确的方针。一个人的政治立场，是通过具体问题反映出来；人的认识的提高，也不是单靠学理论就可以解决问题，必须通过反复的实践。这个道理，毛主席在“实践论”中说得很清楚。列宁也说过：“资产阶级的科学家，是通过他的业务实践，来接受马克思主义的。”这就是理论与实践，政治与业务结合的问题。必须把政治与业务，改造与服务，紧密结合起来。通过业务实践，开展两条道路两种方法两种世界观的斗争，不断端正观察和处理问题的立场观点和方法，只有努力服务，多做工作，才能在改造客观世界的实践过程中，发现自己立场和思想上的更多的问题。通过党和群众的帮助教育，加以解决。从而也才能以正确的立场和观点，从事实践，鼓足干劲，力争上游，敢想敢说敢做，为社会主义建设事业贡献出更多的力量。自反右整风以来，我们云南民革和各民主党派一道，响应党的号召，积极投入农业劳动战线，大炼钢铁，做出了一定的成绩，每个人都得到不同程度的锻炼提高；但也有一些不正确的想法，如有的人以为参加了体力劳动，就不必再进行政治立场和思想改造了。体力劳动，是我们自我改造的根本途径；但参加了劳动，并不等于自己的思想立场已经得到根本改造。在劳动中，必须以政治思想教育为统帅，才能有意识的把我们在劳动实践中的体会，通过政治学习，提高到理性上来，巩固认识；同时通过政治学习，使我们掌握正确的思想武器，来批判在劳动中所表现出来的资产阶级的立场思想，进一步推动政治思想的改造。因此在劳动实践中，只有贯彻政治思想教育为统帅的方针，才能有效的改造自己。业务实践也是一样的道理，不重视政治理论学习，掌握思想武器，要希望用正确的立场观点方法，做好工作，那是不可想像的。这说明资产阶级分子及其知识分子，须认真学习马列主义，学习毛主席著作，用正确的理论，指导实践，才能正确的改造立场和思想，也才能做好工作，积极的为社会主义服务。
    云南民革成员和各地民革成员一样，必须继续进行政治立场的根本改造，努力为社会主义服务，这是肯定不变的方针。今后的问题，是如何更有效的贯彻这一方针。在反右整风以后，我们更应运用“团结——批评——团结”的公式，来提高自己。这里有两个问题谈一谈：
    关于开展批评的两点意见
    （一）鼓励与批评的结合问题。搞思想改造运用鼓励与批评是必要的，因为资产阶级分子及其知识分子的特点，是有两面性的。我们在进行立场和思想改造的过程中，应鼓励它的积极面，批评它的消极面。为了克服缺点，化消极为积极，并发挥其积极力量，必须经过思想斗争，批评与自我批评，就是思想斗争的武器。抛弃了这种武器，便不能说思想改造。当然单只看见消极面，不看见积极面，是不对的；但是如果对一个人鼓励超过了应有的分寸，就会使对方产生盲目自满情绪，阻碍了进步。我们在进行当中，特别要防止这种批评展不开的偏向。对一个同志的优点和缺点，必须有适当的估计，才能正确的贯彻鼓励与批评的方针。
    （二）批评与自我批评的方法和风细雨是需要的，但有风有雨是肯定的。这样做的目的，是为了使每一个人愿意敞开思想，通过辩论，真正解决问题。反右整风以后，成员中的多数人是能敞开思想的；但有少数人怕犯错误，思想不够敞开。产生这种现象的原因，是多方面的：有的是由于没有分清两类矛盾的不同性质，不认识右派分子是客观存在，错误的认为有些人成为右派，就因为乱说话，“言多必失”，不如“守口如瓶”，就不会犯错误；有的是怕谈出真实思想后，受到批评。后一种情况，说明有些人对待自我改造，还缺乏正确的认识。我们运用批评武器的方式，一向是耐心的摆事实讲道理，使对方口服心服，防止采取简单化的办法，不是说服而是压服；但是有些人竟借口运用“和风细雨”，企图逃避改造，这是严重错误的。总之，我们应该是要善于分辨问题，区别对待，使其由不自觉到完全自觉。改造的进度也将随之加快，为社会主义服务的积极性，也将随之提高。
    各位代表：云南民革成员经过反右整风以后，思想认识，均有不同程度的提高。今后更要在中国共产党的领导下，进一步团结我们的成员和所联系的群众，来积极的为社会主义服务。彻底抛弃资本主义立场，坚决站稳社会主义立场，加强自我改造，继续巩固和发展人民民主统一战线，为保证完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而贡献出自己的一切力量。
    另外是西藏一撮上层的反动集团，勾结帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，破坏祖国的统一团结，发动武装叛乱，我政府严令声讨，一举荡平，使藏族僧俗人民从此走上建设幸福生活的新阶段，全国人民皆为之欢欣鼓舞，而印度的干涉主义分子竟敢趁此煽动挑拨，竟称西藏为“国家”，怂恿藏人赶走汉人，甚至组织侮辱我国伟大的领袖毛主席像的示威阴谋活动，是可忍孰不可忍！西藏是我国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，决不容许任何人干涉我国的内政，警告印度的干涉主义分子赶快悬崖勒马回头是岸，否则一定要遭到头破血流的结果。
    以上发言错误很多，请大家给予批评。
