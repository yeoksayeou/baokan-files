　　广西德保县人民公社生产大队建立购销店
    据新华社南宁6日电　广西德保县4月份在各公社的生产大队建立了二百零二个购销店，以适应各人民公社、生产队发展商品生产的需要。
    这些购销店是公社供销部的分支机构，由公社直接领导。它的任务是：收购和调运本大队出产的小宗土产、药材、废品和小宗工业品；帮助大队发展商品生产，代表公社供销部督促、帮助大队履行购销合同；积极组织日用必需品的供应；参与生产，了解群众的购销需要，当好公社供销部和生产大队的助手和参谋。
    各生产大队的社员们对建立购销店都很欢迎。燕洞乡人民公社各大队普遍建立购销店以后，除大宗的产品如茴油、八角、生猪以外，其他小宗土特产品已由购销店就地收购，群众很满意。这个乡的念乐大队、新排大队的购销员还帮助大队组织加工大批箩筐、扁担、木耙等竹木农具，和别的大队进行等价交换，增加了大队的收入。
