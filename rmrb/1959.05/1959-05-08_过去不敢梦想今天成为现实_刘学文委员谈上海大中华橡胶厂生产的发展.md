I was honored to participate in the First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC and attended the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. I listened to the government work report by Premier Zhou Enlai, and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and other leaders. I felt very excited, moved, and encouraged. I wholeheartedly support them and will earnestly implement them in my work.

The great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan and the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 have enabled China's national economy to take a significant leap forward. This speed of development has never existed and is impossible under the capitalist system. It can be said to be unprecedented in world history. Our rubber industry is no exception. Like other national economic sectors across the country, it has experienced rapid development since liberation. In particular, production increased exponentially during the Great Leap Forward movement in 1958. China's annual consumption of raw rubber grew year by year during the First Five-Year Plan, exceeding three times the highest amount before liberation by 1957. In 1958, it increased by more than double on the basis of 1957. If calculated according to social needs this year, raw rubber consumption will exceed the level of the United Kingdom. The UK's raw rubber consumption has only grown by 25% in the last ten years, while we increased it by more than six times in the nine years up to the end of 1958, a development speed 24 times greater than that of the UK. In 1958, not only did national rubber product output increase exponentially, but there was also a significant increase in variety. Before liberation, there were fewer than 5,000 types of rubber products nationwide. After liberation, they gradually increased, estimated to be over 16,000 types by 1957. In 1958 alone, about 4,000 new products were added, and the total number has now reached over 20,000. Such rapid development is also rare in the world. The variety and specifications of tires were less than 40 in 1957, while in 1958 they reached about 110. In addition, scientific research and the trial production of advanced products also achieved great successes in 1958. Products that could not be produced in the past are now being produced in large quantities, thus strongly supporting the needs of China's industry, agriculture, transportation, defense industry, and advanced science and technology for the Great Leap Forward.

A Few Experiences

Taking my work unit, the Shanghai Great China Rubber Factory, as an example, like other brother factories across the country, production is developing year by year. Before liberation, our factory's maximum annual output of automobile tires was less than 10,000 sets, and the largest we could produce was a medium-sized 34×7 tire with a load capacity of 1,200 kilograms, with most being smaller sizes. By 1957, our annual output reached 85,000 sets, with more large-sized tires. The largest we could produce was a heavy-duty 14.00-20 tire with a load capacity of 3,800 kilograms. In 1958, production reached 196,000 sets, including various tractor tires in addition to large tires, more than double that of 1957 and 20 times more than the highest output before liberation. Such rapid development was not only unimaginable in the past private-owned period, but it was something we never even dreamed of. Why was there such rapid development in just a few years? Why was the Great Leap Forward possible? I believe there are the following aspects:

1.	The correct leadership and policies of the Party.

Since liberation, the political and ideological awareness of all our factory workers has greatly improved through various great movements. In particular, after the great victory of the whole-people rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the sense of ownership as masters of our own affairs has been further developed among all the workers in the factory after the joint venture. Especially in 1958, after the Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with and surpass the industrial production level of the United Kingdom in fifteen years, under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, every one of our workers was immensely encouraged, truly filled with enthusiasm and soaring energy, unanimously responding to the Party's call to complete and overfulfill the glorious tasks assigned by the state ahead of schedule. Therefore, magnificent and colorful achievements were made in production, creating unprecedented results.

2.	Implementing the Party's mass line and fully utilizing the wisdom and strength of the masses.

Through the "Two Antis" movement, leaders and cadres at all levels in our factory improved their work style, went deep into the workshops, went deep among the masses, workers participated in management, cadres participated in labor, and leaders and workers became one. All reasonable suggestions put forward by the masses were promptly handled, and the production tasks for each month were explained to the masses, who also engaged in full discussions and made strong guarantees. Key production issues were jointly studied by workers, cadres, and technical personnel, thus fully utilizing the wisdom and strength of the working masses. Everyone thought of ways to propose measures, overcome difficulties, and break through production bottlenecks. For example, our factory's original rubber mixing capacity was insufficient, and we outsourced processing every day in the first quarter. Due to mobilizing the masses, this situation was reversed in the second quarter, and the Great Leap Forward task was completed. Originally, each operation time for vulcanizing tires required sixty minutes, which was gradually shortened to ten minutes. Originally, each tire-forming machine could only produce more than thirty medium-sized tires per day, now it has been increased to more than fifty. Therefore, the output of tires increased month by month, and the annual output was completed more than doubled.

3.	Promoting the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and carrying out the technical revolution movement, thereby improving technical levels and increasing labor productivity.

Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and march toward the technical revolution, the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has been promoted in every work position. Because everyone broke superstitions and emancipated their minds, countless technical innovation and technical revolution measures were proposed. For example, the rubber mixing workshop improved the operating methods, thereby increasing the rubber mixing capacity. The vulcanizing workshop improved the process and shortened the vulcanizing time, which increased the vulcanizing efficiency of tires. Each workshop also improved equipment, such as increasing the speed of certain semi-finished product preparation machinery, increasing the degree of mechanization of the tire-forming machines, and using linkage devices for certain processes. At the same time, the spirit of combining foreign and indigenous methods was applied to manufacture and utilize local equipment, such as using rubber shoe vulcanizing tanks to vulcanize tires. Because the degree of mechanization and linkage was greatly increased, labor was saved, and manual operation was greatly reduced. On the one hand, the potential of the equipment was utilized, and on the other hand, labor productivity was improved. Through a series of technical innovations and technical revolutions, output was increased, quality was improved, labor productivity was increased, raw materials were saved, and the huge leap forward achievement of doubling output was obtained.

I am a technical staff member from the old intellectuals. The tremendous changes in production in the past year in my work position have given me another further socialist education. In addition to deeply feeling that the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is wise and great, and that the Party's policies are absolutely correct, it has given me a deeper and more firm understanding of the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. In particular, the workers' enthusiastic labor, selfless spirit, and the communist spirit of breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act have deeply moved me. This is a concrete reflection of the working class worldview and is the standard that our old intellectuals must achieve in ideological transformation. I also feel very ashamed that I have made few contributions in the past year's vigorous Great Leap Forward movement. The influence of the bourgeoisie of the old intellectuals has not been eliminated, and there are still many superstitions. The work is still conservative, such as hesitating and being afraid to boldly innovate in shortening the vulcanizing time of tires, which has caused certain losses in the work. I feel that I am far behind the workers. Premier Zhou said in his report that all old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in future long-term work practice, and pointed out the direction of self-transformation, saying that old intellectuals should further and thoroughly break with the bourgeois worldview and truly master the worldview of the working class. These instructions are completely correct. I will definitely take these instructions as my motto. I will strengthen my self-transformation for a long time, study Marxism-Leninism, get close to the masses, participate in physical labor, and strive to actively transform myself into a working-class intellectual to repay the Party for my training and education.

The 1959 national economic plan is indeed a magnificent plan for continuing the Great Leap Forward, and it is gratifying and encouraging. We are fully confident in this plan. Under the leadership of the Party, we will implement Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Li Fuchun's instructions to "strengthen centralized leadership, make overall arrangements, seize various organizational measures, and vigorously carry out mass movements on various economic fronts," immediately launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy, and we will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and complete and overfulfill this Great Leap Forward national economic plan on the basis of the victory in 1958, and present a gift to the upcoming 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

A Few Suggestions on Giving Full Play to the Role of Tires

I am a staff member of the rubber industry. The raw materials of the rubber industry are still not able to meet the needs at present, so increasing production and practicing economy is especially significant. In addition to implementing measures to increase production and practice economy to complete the production plan of the rubber industry, I think it is also necessary to give full play to the role of certain major rubber products in use to meet the needs of various departments of the national economy to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic leap forward plan. Below I would like to put forward some opinions on giving full play to the role of tires. Please criticize and correct me if they are appropriate.

Give full play to the role of tires, strengthen the tire retreading industry to adapt to the leap forward development of the rubber industry, meet the needs of the transportation industry, thereby ensuring the realization of the four major indicators.

In the 1959 national economic plan, the leap forward indicator for transportation enterprises is 35 million tons, which is a huge leap forward, an increase of 25% compared to 28 million tons in 1958. Although the national output of automobile tires more than doubled in 1958, the supply of raw materials is still difficult at present, so a plan to leap forward by more than 40% in 1959 compared to 1958 is still far from meeting the needs of the transportation sector. To solve this contradiction, I think it is necessary to quickly strengthen the tire retreading industry to give full play to the due role of tires, and it is also in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. According to the tire usage of the transportation enterprise sector, due to the improvement of management level and tire usage technology in the past few years (tire production technology has also made a leap forward), the situation of early damage to general tires, except for surface wear, has basically decreased. Therefore, the mileage of tire use has increased, and the possibility of retreading old tires is also increasing, creating favorable conditions for giving full play to the due role of tires. According to the Soviet magazine "Rubber and Rubber" in the eighth issue of 1957, the average number of tire retreads in the United States exceeds 30% of the number of new tires produced (that is, 130% of new tires), and the service life of retreaded tires is equivalent to 70% of new tires. According to British magazine data, the United Kingdom needs 6 million tires per year, of which retreaded tires account for 40% (that is, 66% of new tires). China's tire retreading industry has made great progress since liberation, and there was also a great leap forward in 1958, but according to understanding, the production capacity is only about 200,000 tires per year, which not only cannot meet the needs of the transportation industry, but also is not adapted to the rapid development of rubber industry production, far behind, less than one-tenth. If it does not keep up in time, most of the new tires will inevitably miss the opportunity to retread and be used until scrapped, not only failing to give full play to the due role of tires, greatly reducing the total mileage, causing waste of raw materials, but also affecting the leap forward of the transportation industry. The tire retreading industry requires simpler equipment, less investment, only about one-twentieth, and less use of raw materials compared to the new tire manufacturing industry, consuming about 20% of raw rubber for new tires, which is completely in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy with small investment and great results, and is suitable for blooming everywhere. In order to save raw materials, save foreign exchange, quickly meet the needs of the transportation sector, and give full play to the due role of tires, I think the following measures need to be taken:

(1) Tire manufacturers should actively take measures to improve formulas, improve designs, improve the fatigue resistance of tires, overcome the phenomenon of delamination of the tire body fabric, and increase the retreading rate of tires.

(2) The transportation sector should strengthen the development of the tire retreading industry to adapt to the development of new tire production, so as to give full play to the role of tires. According to current estimates, at least a level of 1.5 million to 2 million tires per year should be reached to adapt and meet the needs of the transportation Great Leap Forward.

(3) Exchange domestic retreading experience, improve retreading technology, improve retreading quality, especially some retreading factories with poor equipment and low technology should strengthen technical innovation, learn from advanced experience, and quickly improve, so that the average mileage of retreaded tires reaches the international level, give full play to the role of tires, and accumulate wealth for the country.

(4) It is recommended that carbon black manufacturers, in addition to vigorously increasing production, should also control raw materials, improve technology, and further improve the quality of carbon black, improve wear resistance, thereby increasing the mileage of tires. According to our factory's experimental results, high wear-resistant carbon black has more than 20% higher wear resistance than ordinary hard carbon black. If the tread wear resistance is increased by more than 20%, the mileage of new tires can be greatly increased, which has a great effect on saving raw materials and meeting the needs of transportation.

(5) It is recommended that the textile sector quickly complete the production and supply of high-strength rayon to improve the strength and fatigue resistance of the tire body fabric, thereby increasing the number of tire retreads, so as to give full play to the role of tires, save raw materials, and meet the needs of transportation. According to the trial use of a batch of high-strength rayon tires made by our factory in Guangzhou, although it has not yet ended, after overload, towing, and acceleration tests, it is estimated that the minimum mileage is about 70,000 kilometers, and the maximum can reach about 99,000 kilometers, which is close to the British Dunlop tires used in the same place, with a minimum of 67,000 kilometers and a maximum of 107,000 kilometers, and they all have retreading conditions, which is a great improvement compared to cotton fiber tires. Because rayon has high strength and good heat resistance, it can reduce the number of tire body fabric layers and save raw rubber, and the number of retreads is also high, laying a favorable foundation for improving the mileage of tires, further giving full play to the role of tires, and increasing the retreading rate in the future.

The above immature opinions are personal onesided views. If there are any inappropriateness please feel free to criticize and correct them.

I wish the conference a complete success!

　　过去不敢梦想今天成为现实
    刘学文委员谈上海大中华橡胶厂生产的发展
    我光荣地参加了政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议，和列席了第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席等各位首长的报告，感到非常兴奋、激动和鼓舞。我完全衷心的拥护，并将认真地在工作中加以贯彻。
    第一个五年计划的伟大成就，和一九五八年的全面大跃进，使我国的国民经济大大地跨跃了一步。这种发展的速度在资本主义制度下是从来没有的，亦是不可能有的，可以说在世界历史上是空前的。我们橡胶工业亦不例外，和全国其他国民经济部门一样，解放以来，有着飞速的发展，特别是一九五八年的大跃进运动中，生产亦成倍地增加。我国生胶的年消耗量，在第一个五年计划期内逐年增长，到一九五七年超过了解放前最高额的三倍多，而一九五八年又在一九五七年的基础上增长了一倍多，今年如果根据社会需要量来计算，生胶消耗量就要超过英国的水平。英国最近十年间生胶的消耗不过增长了百分之二十五，我们到一九五八年末的九年间，却增加六倍多，发展速度比英国大二十四倍。一九五八年全国橡胶制品不但在产量上有了成倍的增加，在品种上亦有了飞跃的增长。解放前全国橡胶制品不满五千种，解放后逐年增加，到一九五七年估计在一万六千种以上，而一九五八年一年就增加了新产品四千种左右，现在总数已达到二万种以上，这样的快速发展亦是世界上所罕有的，轮胎的品种规格，一九五七年不到四十种，而一九五八年达到了一百一十种左右。此外科学研究和尖端产品的试制，在一九五八年亦取得了巨大的成就。过去不能生产的产品，现在大量地生产了，因此有力地支援了我国工业、农业、交通运输业、国防工业和尖端科学技术等大跃进的需要。
    几点体会
    以我的工作单位上海大中华橡胶厂来说，与全国其他兄弟厂一样，生产在逐年发展中。解放前我厂汽车轮胎最高年产量不足一万套，最大只能生产负荷一千二百公斤的34×7的中型轮胎，而大部分为小型的。到一九五七年我们年产量达到八万五千套，其中大型的较多，最大的我们已能生产负荷三千八百公斤的14.00—20重型轮胎，一九五八年生产却达到了十九万六千套，除大型胎外，其中还包括了多种拖拉机轮胎，比一九五七年翻了一番多，比解放前最高产量增加了二十倍。这样飞速的发展，在过去私营时期不要说没有想过，就是连梦亦没有做过。为什么在短短的几年中能够有这样快的发展呢？为什么能够大跃进呢？我体会有下列几方面：
    1、党的领导与方针政策的正确。
    解放以来我们全厂职工通过各项伟大的运动，政治思想觉悟有了很大的提高，特别在合营后当家做主的主人翁思想在全厂职工中更发挥了。尤其是在全民整风、反右斗争取得伟大胜利后，一九五八年党中央提出了十五年赶上和超过英国工业生产水平的号召，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀之下，我们每一个职工得到了无比的鼓舞，真是热情沸腾，干劲冲天，一致响应党的号召，要提前完成和超额完成国家交下来的光荣任务。因此在生产上放出了光芒万丈的异彩，而创出了空前成绩。
    2、贯彻了党的群众路线，充分发挥了群众的智慧与力量。
    通过了双反运动，我厂各级领导与干部改进了风作，深入车间，深入群众，工人参加了管理，干部参加了劳动，领导与工人打成了一片。凡群众提出的合理化建议都及时作了处理，每一个月的生产任务都向群众作了交代，而群众亦作了充分的讨论，提出了有力的保证。生产上的关键问题都组织了工人、干部和技术人员一起共同研究，因此工人群众的智慧与力量充分得到了发挥，大家想办法提措施，纷纷克服困难，突破生产关键。例如我厂原来炼胶能力不足，一季度时每天向外委托加工，由于发动了群众，二季度就扭转了这个局面，并完成了大跃进任务，原来硫化轮胎的每一次操作时间需要六十分钟，逐步缩短到十分钟。原来中型轮胎的成型每台成型机每天只三十多条，现在提高到五十多条。因此轮胎的产量逐月提高，年产量完成了一倍以上。
    3、发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，开展了技术革命运动，从而提高了技术水平，提高了劳动生产率。
    从党中央提出了破除迷信、解放思想、向技术革命进军的号召后，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格在各个工作岗位上发扬了起来。由于大家破除了迷信，解放了思想，遂提出了无数的技术革新和技术革命措施，例如炼胶车间改进了操作法，因此提高了炼胶能力，硫化车间改进了工艺，缩短了硫化时间，就增加了轮胎的硫化效率。各车间并且改进了设备，如提高了某些半制品准备机械的车速，增加了成型机的机械化程度，某些工序采用了联动装置，同时又应用了洋土结合的精神，制造和利用了土设备，例如利用胶鞋的硫化罐来硫化轮胎等，由于机械化联动化的程度大大增加，因此节约了劳动力，大大减少了手工操作，一方面发挥了设备的潜力，一方面提高了劳动生产率。通过一连串的技术革新和技术革命，提高了产量，提高了质量，提高了劳动生产率，节约了原材料，并且获得了产量翻一番的巨大的跃进成果。
    我是一个旧知识分子的技术人员，在工作岗位上经过了一年来生产中巨大的变化，使我又受了一次进一步的社会主义的教育。我除了深切感到党和毛主席的领导英明伟大，党的方针政策绝对正确外，使我对社会主义制度的无比优越性有了更深刻更坚定的认识，特别是工人们的干劲冲天的劳动、忘我无私的精神和破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，使我深深的感动，这完全是工人阶级世界观的具体反映，是我们旧知识分子思想改造所必须做到的标准。我亦感到很惭愧，在一年来轰轰烈烈的大跃进运动中，很少有贡献，旧知识分子的资产阶级的影响还没有消除，还存在不少的迷信，工作还保守，像对轮胎的缩短硫化时间，还是畏畏缩缩不敢大胆革新，使工作上造成一定的损失。我觉得我还是远远落在工人们的后面。周总理报告中说，一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造，并指出了自我改造的方向说，旧知识分子要进一步彻底地同资产阶级的世界观决裂，真正掌握工人阶级的世界观，这些指示完全是正确的，我一定把这些指示作为我的座右铭，我要长期加强我的自我改造，学习马列主义，靠近群众，参加体力劳动，努力积极地把自己改造成为一个工人阶级的知识分子，来报答党对我的培养与教育。
    一九五九年的国民经济计划的确是一个继续大跃进的宏伟的计划，是令人欢欣鼓舞的，这个计划我们完全有信心，在党的领导下，贯彻周恩来总理和李富春副总理的指示“加强集中领导，全面安排，抓紧各项组织措施，大力开展各个经济战线上的群众运动”的方针，立即开展一个增产节约的全民运动，一定能够克服一切困难，在一九五八年的胜利基础上，来完成和超额完成这个大跃进的国民经济计划，向即将到来的建国十周年纪念献礼。
   发挥轮胎作用的几点建议
    我是橡胶工业的工作人员，橡胶工业在目前原料还是不能满足需要的，所以增产节约尤其有重大的意义。除了贯彻增产节约的措施来完成橡胶工业的生产计划外，我认为还应该充分发挥某些主要橡胶产品在使用中的作用，以满足国民经济各个部门的需要，来完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济跃进计划，亦是必要的。下面我就发挥轮胎的作用方面提出一点意见，是否确当，请各位批评指正。
    充分发挥轮胎的作用，加强轮胎的翻新工业来适应橡胶工业的飞跃发展，满足交通运输事业的需要，从而保证四大指标的实现。
    一九五九年国民经济计划中交通运输企业的跃进指标为三千五百万吨，比一九五八年的二千八百万吨要增长百分之二十五，这是一个巨大的跃进。汽车轮胎生产一九五八年全国虽然跃进了一倍多，但是目前原材料供应还有困难，所以一九五九年的计划比一九五八年再跃进百分之四十以上，还是远远不能满足交通运输部门的需要的。要解决这一个矛盾，我认为应当迅速加强轮胎的翻新工业来充分发挥轮胎的应有的作用是必要的，亦是符合增产节约的精神的。根据运输企业部门轮胎使用情况来看，由于几年来管理水平和轮胎使用技术的提高（轮胎生产技术亦有飞跃的提高），一般轮胎，除了表面磨耗外，早期损坏的情况基本上减少了，因此轮胎的使用里程增加，而旧轮胎翻新的可能亦越来越大了，对发挥轮胎应有的作用，创造了有利条件。据苏联“橡胶与橡皮”杂志一九五七年第八期载美国轮胎翻新数量，平均超过生产新胎数量的百分之三十（即新胎的百分之一百三十），翻新轮胎使用寿命相当于新胎的百分之七十。据英国杂志资料英国每年需要轮胎六百万条，其中翻新轮胎占百分之四十（即新胎的百分之六十六）。我国轮胎翻新工业，解放后有很大的发展，一九五八年亦有很大的跃进，但据了解生产能力全年约仅二十万条左右，不但不能满足交通运输业的需要，且与橡胶工业生产的飞速发展亦不相适应，远为落后，犹不足十分之一，倘不及时跟上，则大部分新胎势必错失翻新机会，使用到报废为止，不独没有发挥轮胎应有的作用，使总的行驶里程大大减少，造成原材料的浪费，而且亦影响交通运输事业的跃进。轮胎翻新工业，比之新胎制造工业，需要的设备简单，投资少，只约二十分之一左右，使用原料亦少，耗用生胶为新胎百分之二十左右，完全符合投资小效果大的增产节约精神，并且宜于遍地开花。为了节约原材料，节约外汇，迅速满足交通运输部门的需要，充分发挥轮胎的应有作用，我认为需要采取下列措施：
    （1）轮胎制造厂要积极采取措施，改进配方改进设计，提高轮胎耐疲劳性能，克服胎身布层脱空现象，而提高轮胎的翻新率。
    （2）交通运输部门要加强发展轮胎翻新工业，使与新胎生产的发展相适应，从而充分发挥轮胎的作用，根据目前估计至少应当达到年产一百五十万到二百万条的水平，才能适应，才能满足交通运输大跃进的需要。
    （3）交流国内翻新经验，提高翻新技术，提高翻新质量，特别是设备较差，技术较低的一些翻新工厂尤宜加强技术革新，学习先进，迅速提高，使翻新胎的平均里程达到国际水平，充分发挥轮胎的作用，而为国家积累财富。
    （4）建议炭黑制造厂除大力增产外，并要控制原料改进技术，进一步提高炭黑质量，提高耐磨性能，从而提高轮胎行驶里程。根据我厂试验结果，高耐磨炭黑比一般硬质炭黑的耐磨性能高百分之二十以上，如果胎面耐磨性能提高百分之二十以上，新胎的行驶里程即可大大提高，对节约原材料与满足交通运输的需要有很大的作用。
    （5）建议纺织部门迅速完成强力人造丝的生产供应，以提高轮胎胎身布层的强力与耐疲劳性能，从而提高轮胎的翻新次数，以充分发挥轮胎的作用而节约原材料，满足交通运输的需要。根据我厂所制一批强力人造丝轮胎在广州试用情况，现在虽未结束，经过超载加拖加速等考验，估计最低行驶里程约七万公里，最高约可达九万九千公里，与在同地使用的英国邓禄普的轮胎最低六万七千公里最高十万七千公里相接近，还都具有翻新条件，比棉纤维的轮胎有了很大的提高，由于人造丝强力大，耐热性能好，可减少胎身布层，又可节约生胶，而翻新次数亦高，并对今后提高轮胎行驶里程，进一步发挥轮胎的作用，提高翻新率，打下有利的基础。
    以上几点不成熟的意见，是个人片面的看法，如有不当，请大家批评指正。
    祝大会胜利成功！
