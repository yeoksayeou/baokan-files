Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 26th: Workers at the Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant of the Huainan Coal Mine are continuously improving operational techniques and strengthening equipment maintenance, leading to a significant increase in coal washing output and quality. From May 1st to 20th, 82,245 tons of raw coal were washed, an increase of 18.2% compared to the same period in April. The ash content of refined coal decreased from 13.18% in April to 11.4%.

The Wangfenggang Coal Washing Plant was put into production at the end of last year. With the continuous improvement of workers' operational skills, the output of refined coal has increased month by month. From January to April this year, the plant overfulfilled the plan by washing more than 31,000 tons of refined coal for the state. However, the problem at the time was the high ash content of the refined coal. In order to improve the quality of refined coal, the plant strengthened ideological education for the workers, making them realize the importance of improving the quality of refined coal for ensuring steel production. On the other hand, it actively mobilized the masses to improve operational techniques. Originally, the coarse coal powder mixed into the refined coal was not washed. Now, the workers wash it through a jigging machine, reducing the ash content from the original 18.74% to 15.46%.

To ensure the quality of refined coal, workers have also strengthened equipment maintenance, enabling the equipment to operate safely.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 26th: The Jiulonggang Coal Mine in Huainan has strengthened coal quality management, and the ash content of coal has been continuously decreasing. From January to April this year, the ash content of raw coal was reduced by 0.27% compared to the plan, and the ash content of coal prepared for shipment after screening was reduced by 0.52% compared to the plan. From May 1st to 20th, the ash content of shipped coal was reduced by another 0.14% compared to the plan. Currently, the mine is further taking measures to ensure that the ash content of raw coal and shipped coal will be reduced by 0.43% and 0.45% respectively this year compared to last year.

    淮南望峰岗洗选厂九龙岗煤矿
    管理工作加强  原煤灰分降低
    新华社合肥26日电  淮南煤矿望峰岗洗选厂职工，不断改进操作技术和加强设备维护检修工作，使洗煤产量和质量有了显著提高。5月1日至20日入洗原煤八万二千二百四十五吨，比4月份同期增加18.2％；精煤的灰分，由4月份的13.18％下降到11.4％。
    望峰岗洗选厂是去年底投入生产的厂。随着职工操作技术水平的不断提高，精煤的产量逐月增加。今年1至4月份，全厂超计划为国家多洗精煤三万一千多吨。但当时的问题是精煤的灰分高。为了提高精煤的质量，这个厂一方面加强职工的思想教育，使职工们认识到提高精煤质量，对保证钢铁生产的重要意义；另一方面，积极发动群众改进操作技术。原来掺入精煤中去的粗煤粉，是不经过洗选的，现在工人们把它通过跳汰机进行洗选后，使灰分由原来的18.74％下降到15.46％。
    为保证精煤质量，职工们还加强了设备的维护检修，使设备能够安全运转。
    据新华社合肥26日电  淮南九龙岗煤矿加强煤质管理工作，煤的灰分不断下降。今年1月到4月，原煤的灰分较计划降低了0.27％，经过筛选准备外运的煤灰分较计划降低了0.52％。5月1日至20日，外运的煤灰分又比计划降低了0.14％。目前，这个矿正在进一步采取措施，保证今年原煤和外运煤的灰分分别比去年降低0.43％和0.45％。
