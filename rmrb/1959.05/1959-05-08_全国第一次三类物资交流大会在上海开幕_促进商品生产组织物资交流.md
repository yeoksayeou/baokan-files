Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. The first National Three Categories of Materials Exchange Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Light Industry, opened in Shanghai on the 6th.

More than 4,000 people attended the conference, comprising thirty delegations from industrial and commercial departments of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Representatives from the State Council's Fifth Office, the State Economic Commission, the State Planning Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the Ministry of Health, and the two economic cooperation zones of East China and Northeast China also participated.

This conference was convened in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's approval and transmission of the Ministry of Commerce's "Report on Holding Materials Exchange Conferences at All Levels to Further Improve Urban and Rural Materials Exchange." The tasks of the conference are to use the form of materials exchange meetings to ascertain the production and demand situation of the third category of commodities that cannot yet be directly incorporated into the national plan on a national scale, to better organize commodity circulation and arrange production, to further strengthen cooperation between urban and rural areas, regions, and industry and commerce, to promote the development of diversified economies in people's communes, to find raw materials for industry, and to find commodities for markets and exports, in order to meet the needs of national construction and the people's lives.

At the meeting on the 6th, Cheng Zihua, Minister of Commerce, spoke. He said that this conference should conduct the exchange and distribution of the third category of commodities in a planned and organized manner, which is a form of planned distribution of the entire commodity under the socialist system. He requested representatives from all regions to implement the principle of "the whole country as a single chessboard," to promote the spirit of communist mutual assistance and cooperation, to actively organize production in producing areas to meet the needs of marketing areas as much as possible, and to realistically propose procurement plans in marketing areas, so that the meeting can truly play a role in promoting production and organizing commodity circulation in a planned manner.

The conference established six exchange and trade halls: native products and handicrafts, waste products and mineral products, non-staple foods, traditional Chinese and Western medicine, hardware, transportation, electrical equipment and chemical raw materials, and daily-use industrial products. Representatives from all regions will trade commodities by industry.

Prior to the convening of this conference, many provinces, special zones, counties, and people's communes had already held materials exchange meetings separately. The Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Light Industry had successively held two preparatory meetings in Shanghai to prepare conditions for the success of this exchange conference.

　　全国第一次三类物资交流大会在上海开幕
    促进商品生产组织物资交流
    新华社上海7日电　商业部和轻工业部联合召开的全国第一次三类物资交流大会，6日在上海开幕。
    出席这次会议的有全国各省市自治区工业、商业等部门代表组成的三十个代表团，共四千多人。国务院第五办公室、国家经济委员会、国家计划委员会、第一机械工业部、林业部、水产部、卫生部和华东、东北两个经济协作区，也派有代表参加。
    这次大会是根据国务院批转商业部“关于逐级召开物资交流会进一步做好城乡物资交流的报告”的精神召开的。大会的任务是：通过物资交流会的形式，在全国范围内摸清楚还不可能直接纳入国家计划的第三类商品的生产和需要情况，更好地组织商品流通和安排生产，进一步加强城乡、地区、工商之间的协作，促进人民公社发展多种经济，为工业找原料，为市场和出口找商品，以满足国家建设和人民生活的需要。
    在6日的会议上，商业部部长程子华讲了话。他说，这一次大会要把第三类商品有计划、有组织地进行交流分配，这是社会主义制度下整个商品有计划分配的一种形式。他要求各地代表贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，发扬共产主义互助协作精神，产区要积极组织生产，尽量满足销区的需要，销区要实事求是地提出要货计划，使会议真正起到促进生产和有计划地组织商品流通的作用。
    大会设立了土产和手工业品、废品和矿产品、副食品、中西医药、五金交通电工器材和化工原料、日用工业品六个交流贸易馆。各地代表将按行业分商品成交。
    在这次大会召开以前，许多省、专区、县、人民公社已经分别举行了物资交流会，商业部和轻工业部先后在上海举行过两次预备会议，为开好这次交流大会准备了条件。（附图片）
