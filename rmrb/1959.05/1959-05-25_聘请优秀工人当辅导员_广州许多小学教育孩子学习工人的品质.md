Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 24th: Many primary schools' Young Pioneer organizations in Guangzhou have, since the beginning of this semester, hired a large number of outstanding young workers as Young Pioneer mentors, which has already achieved good results.

The worker mentors hired by these school's Young Pioneer organizations are all outstanding members of the Communist Youth League or young Communist Party members from factories near the schools. They actively assist the schools in mentoring the Young Pioneers politically, ideologically, and in production labor, using the excellent qualities and labor perspectives of the working class to educate the children. These worker mentors and the school mentors jointly develop Young Pioneer activity plans each month, closely integrating Young Pioneer activities with social reality and production labor. For example, when the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee called for clearing warehouses to find raw materials to support industrial construction, the worker mentors introduced the situation of the factory's raw material supply to the Young Pioneers and organized them to carry out waste collection activities, which not only strengthened the members' labor production education but also supported industrial production. In the city-wide movement to learn from Xiang Xiuli's noble qualities and protect state property, the worker mentors led the Young Pioneers to visit factories and organized them to participate in appropriate production labor, giving them the opportunity to have extensive contact with the working class. Whenever factories held commendation meetings for advanced producers, production leap forward mobilization rallies, and other activities, the worker mentors also led the Young Pioneers to participate and organized them to hold forums with veteran workers and advanced producers, making the Young Pioneer activities rich and colorful. Some Young Pioneers at Xianhu Road Primary School were previously reluctant to participate in labor, and also didn't study hard. After a series of education programs including mentoring by worker mentors and organizing factory visits, they all strove to do more work during labor, and their enthusiasm for learning was greatly improved, with significant progress in their academic performance.

    聘请优秀工人当辅导员
    广州许多小学教育孩子学习工人的品质
    新华社广州24日电　广州市许多小学的少先队组织，从本学期起聘请大批优秀青年工人当少先队辅导员，已经收到良好的效果。
    这些学校少先队组织聘请的工人辅导员，都是学校附近工厂里的优秀共青团员或青年共产党员。他们积极地协助学校从政治上、思想上和生产劳动上辅导少先队员，以工人阶级的优秀品质、劳动观点来教育少年儿童。这些工人辅导员和学校里的辅导员每月在一起制订出少先队的活动计划，使少先队活动和社会实际，劳动生产密切地结合起来。如当中共广州市委号召清理仓库寻找原料和材料支援工业建设时，工人辅导员就向少先队员介绍工厂原料、材料供应的情况，组织少先队员开展拾废品的活动，既加强了队员的劳动生产教育，又支援了工业生产。在全市学习向秀丽高贵品质、保护国家财产的运动中，工人辅导员们就带领少先队员参观工厂，并且组织他们参加适当的生产劳动，使他们有机会和工人阶级广泛地接触。每当工厂举行表扬先进生产者大会、生产跃进誓师大会等活动时，工人辅导员也都带领少先队员参加，并且组织少先队员和老工人、先进生产者举行座谈会，使少先队的活动丰富多彩。仙湖路小学有的少先队员过去不大愿意参加劳动，学习也不用功。经过工人辅导员辅导、组织参观工厂等一系列教育之后，他们在劳动时都争着多干，学习的积极性也大大提高，学习成绩有了显著的进步。（附图片）
