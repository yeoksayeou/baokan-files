Huang Zhiyong, a long-distance runner from the People's Liberation Army Air Force, broke or equaled three national records in four days at the Second National Games of the People's Liberation Army, drawing widespread praise and attention from sports enthusiasts in the capital. On May 7th, in the men's 10,000-meter final, Huang Zhiyong completed the race in 31 minutes and 12.6 seconds, breaking the national record of 31 minutes and 22.4 seconds set by Su Wenren last November. On the 9th, he again finished first in the 5,000-meter final with a time of 14 minutes and 57.2 seconds, breaking the national record of 15 minutes and 0.2 seconds set by Su Wenren last year, becoming the first 5,000-meter runner in China to break the 15-minute barrier. This shattered the belief that Chinese athletes would find it difficult to break the 15-minute barrier in the 5,000-meter race. On May 10th, Huang Zhiyong continued to exert great effort, running the 3,000 meters in 8 minutes and 41.2 seconds despite the drizzle, equaling the national record set by Fu Shenghai in July 1956.

Huang Zhiyong is a soldier from a farmhand family in Chen County, Hunan. He joined the People's Liberation Army in 1950 and is 25 years old this year. He first began to show promise on the track and field in 1957. At the National Track and Field Games that year, he won the Group B 5,000-meter championship and the 10,000-meter runner-up with times of 15 minutes and 21.8 seconds and 32 minutes and 8 seconds, respectively. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Huang Zhiyong also took a leap forward, repeatedly breaking national records and entering the ranks of China's outstanding long-distance runners. On January 19th of that year, Huang Zhiyong broke the national 5,000-meter record held by long-distance running star Fu Shenghai for more than two years with a time of 15 minutes and 7.7 seconds. Subsequently, in February and May of that year, he broke his own record twice with times of 15 minutes and 6.8 seconds and 15 minutes and 3.4 seconds. It wasn't until October 1958 that his 5,000-meter time was broken by Zhao Baorong of Tianjin. In November, Su Wenren of Yunnan created China's best 5,000-meter and 10,000-meter records for 1958 with times of 15 minutes and 0.2 seconds and 31 minutes and 22.4 seconds. Now, only about half a year later, Huang Zhiyong has surpassed Su Wenren and created the best national results, which can be described as a great leap forward.

Huang Zhiyong's rapid progress in a short period of just over two years is a victory for the Party's policy of sports serving labor production and national defense construction. It is also the result of Huang Zhiyong's own hard work and his display of a highly tenacious spirit. Before joining the army, Huang Zhiyong was a cowherd and was not in very good health. However, after joining the army, under the care and education of the Party, he realized that "it is difficult to complete the task of defending the motherland without a strong body." From 1954, he actively participated in mass sports activities in the company. Not only did he get up half an hour early every day to run and jump rope, and often ran and jumped with sandbags tied to his legs, but he also closely combined sports activities with his work. When he was a communication and telephone operator, he would run as fast as possible, whether delivering orders, sending documents, or checking telephone lines. Even when walking or helping the people carry water and firewood, he would walk quickly. Sometimes, he could spend an average of ten hours a week running six or seven kilometers on the road. He never stopped exercising, regardless of severe winter or hot summer. At the same time, he constantly received guidance from long-distance running stars. This gave him wings and allowed him to take flight.

Now, Huang Zhiyong has jumped to the top spot in the national 10,000-meter and 5,000-meter long-distance running events. His goal is now set on even higher achievements. (Attached picture)

    黄志勇连破全国纪录
    新华社记者　冶峰
    解放军空军部队长跑选手黄志勇，在解放军第二届体育运动大会上四天连续二破一平三项国家纪录，引起首都广大体育爱好者的普遍赞扬和注意。5月7日，黄志勇在男子一万公尺长跑决赛中，以三十一分十二秒六的时间跑完全程，打破了苏文仁去年11月创造的三十一分二十二秒四的全国纪录。9日，他又在五千公尺长跑决赛中，以十四分五十七秒二的时间首先跑到终点，打破了苏文仁去年创造的十五分零秒二的全国纪录，成为我国第一个突破了十五分钟“大关”的五千公尺长跑选手，从而打破了有人认为我国运动员在五千公尺赛跑中难破十五分大关的观念。5月10日，黄志勇继续鼓足干劲，冒着霏霏细雨，又以八分四十一秒二的时间跑完三千公尺，同傅生海1956年七月创造的全国纪录相平。
    黄志勇是湖南郴县一个雇农家庭出身的战士，1950年参加人民解放军，今年二十五岁。1957年他才开始在田径场上初露锋芒。他在这年的全国田径运动会上，分别以十五分二十一秒八和三十二分八秒的成绩，获得乙组五千公尺冠军和一万公尺亚军。大跃进的1958年，黄志勇也迈开了跃进的步伐，连续多次打破全国纪录，进入我国优秀长跑选手的行列。这年1月19日，黄志勇以十五分七秒七的成绩首破长跑名将傅生海保持了两年多的五千公尺全国纪录。接着，他又在这年的2月和5月间，又先后以十五分六秒八和十五分三秒四的成绩两次打破自己的纪录。直到1958年10月间，他的五千公尺成绩才被天津选手赵宝荣突破，11月间，云南选手苏文仁又以十五分零秒二和三十一分二十二秒四的成绩，创造了我国1958年五千公尺和一万公尺的最高纪录。现在，时间不过半年左右，黄志勇又超过了苏文仁，创造了全国最好成绩，可以称得是大步跃进了。
    黄志勇在不长的两年多的时间内成绩突飞猛进，是党的体育运动为劳动生产，为国防建设服务的方针的胜利，也是黄志勇本人刻苦努力、发挥了高度顽强精神的结果。黄志勇入伍前是一个放牛娃，身体并不十分好。可是，他入伍之后，在党的关怀和教育下，体会到了“没有强健的身体就难完成保卫祖国的任务”，从1954年起，积极地参加了连队群众性体育活动。他不但每天早起半小时作跑步和跳绳，时常在腿上绑上沙袋跑跳，而且还把体育活动和自己的工作紧密结合起来。他当通信员和电话员时，无论传达命令、递送文件或检查电话线路，都尽量飞步急跑，甚至平时走路或帮助人民群众挑水担柴也快步如飞。有时候，他每个星期平均可抽上十个小时的休息时间在公路上跑上六、七万公尺。无论严冬或盛夏，从未停止过锻炼，同时，他还不断得到长跑名将的指点。这就使他如虎添翼，展翅飞翔起来。
    现在，黄志勇已经跃居一万公尺和五千公尺长跑的全国第一把交椅。他的目标又对准了更高的成绩。（附图片）
