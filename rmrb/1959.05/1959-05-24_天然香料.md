Have you heard of machines that eat flowers? At the Baihua Fragrance Factory near Huadi in the suburbs of Guangzhou, there are machines specifically designed to devour fresh flowers. Beautiful and fragrant jasmine, roses, white orchids, Arabian jasmine, and bitter orange flowers, after being processed by these machines, become natural fragrance extracts.

Natural fragrances include flowers, leaves, fruits, and resins from plants, as well as secretions from male musk deer, civets, beavers, and sperm whales in the animal kingdom.

China is one of the countries with the richest natural fragrance resources. The Guangzhou Baihua Fragrance Factory, the only one of its kind in the country, has already produced more than eighty kinds of high-grade fragrances, including various fresh flower concretes and natural fragrance oils. These products are supplied to chemical plants all over the country, and a portion is sold abroad.

    天然香料
    你听说过吃花的机器吗？在广州市郊花地附近的百花香料厂里，就有专门吞食鲜花的机器。美丽芬芳的茉莉花、玫瑰花、白兰花、素馨花、玳玳花等，经过机器的处理，就成为天然香精。
    天然香精，包括植物的花、叶、果、树脂，动物中雄麝鹿、灵猫、海狸、抹香鲸鱼的分泌物等。
    我国是天然香料资源最丰富的国家。国内唯一的广州百花香料厂已经生产了八十多种高级香料，包括各种鲜花浸膏和天然香料油。这些产品供应全国各地的化学厂，一部分销售国外。
