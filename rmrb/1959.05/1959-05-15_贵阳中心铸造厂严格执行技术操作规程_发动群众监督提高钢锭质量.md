Guiyang Central Foundry Strictly Implements Technical Operating Procedures
Mobilizes the Masses to Supervise and Improve Steel Ingot Quality

(According to the Guizhou Daily) The steelmaking workshop of Guiyang Central Foundry closely integrates the vigorous mass movement with strict production technical management, and has established a mass-based quality supervision system where everyone guards their post and everyone abides by technical procedures. Initial results have been achieved in the past two months: more than 90% of the steel ingots have met the quality standards set by the province; 70% have met the central standards; the steel ingot yield has remained above 95%, and all can be rolled into steel.

In order to ensure that every heat of steel from the small converters is of good quality, the Central Foundry launched a mass campaign at the beginning of this year to promote and explore a set of advanced technical experiences and organizational measures. They adopted the following measures: strengthening batching management; adding manganese sand to the pig iron furnace to remove sulfur; adding salt to the molten iron ladle to remove sulfur; strictly removing slag and prohibiting slag from entering the converter; promoting bottom-pouring casting methods; and promoting the operational experience of using cold water to seal the top during casting. These technical and organizational measures have ensured the quality of steel ingots. However, in the beginning, due to lax management, especially the lack of a responsibility system, and the factory having many new workers, technical measures often could not be conscientiously implemented, which affected the quality of the steel.

In order to transform quality control into a conscious mass movement, the Guiyang Central Foundry has conducted a series of ideological and organizational efforts in the past two months. On the one hand, they repeatedly conducted ideological education among employees on the principle of "quality first," explaining the rationale that without quality, there is no quantity in current steelmaking production. In the evaluation and inspection work, quality has been listed as an important component. On the other hand, they have also taken some practical organizational measures to attract and organize the masses to care about and supervise quality. In the past, their laboratory reports were only sent to the factory director or workshop director and were not seen by the masses. Now, they have established a system for delivering laboratory reports to the site, ensuring that inspections are conducted every three heats of steel, and that results are obtained within half an hour each time and communicated to the operators of each process. This enables all employees to pay attention to production quality at all times.

On the basis of the masses caring about quality, they further focused on on-site technical and quality education. For example, one worker did not believe in the effect of adding manganese sand. The workshop leaders presented two different approaches and two different results, providing different test results for everyone to discuss and conduct comparative analysis. Through these methods, employees have gained a deeper understanding of the significance of each technical measure. Implementation has also become more conscious. At the same time, the workshop has also established a system of cadre follow-up and gatekeeping and a mass-based mutual supervision system to ensure the implementation of technical experience organizationally. The Party Secretary and Factory Director in charge of steelmaking, as well as the Steelmaking Workshop Director and technicians, insist on taking turns working shifts to strictly guard the gates. On the other hand, they earnestly establish a responsibility system and mobilize the masses to supervise the implementation of technical measures.

    贵阳中心铸造厂严格执行技术操作规程
    发动群众监督提高钢锭质量
    据贵州日报消息　贵阳中心铸造厂炼钢车间把轰轰烈烈的群众运动和严格的生产技术管理紧密结合起来，建立了一个群众性的质量监督制度，人人把守关口，个个遵守技术规程。两个月来已初奏成效：90％以上的钢锭均达到省定的质量标准；70％达到了中央标准；钢的成锭率一直保持在95％以上，而且都能轧成钢材。
    为了保证小转炉炉炉炼好钢，中心铸造厂从今年初就发动群众推广和摸索了一套先进技术经验和组织措施。他们采取了：加强配料管理；化铁炉加锰砂去硫；铁水包内加食盐去硫；严格扒渣，禁止渣子入转炉；推广底浇的浇注方法；推广冷水封顶的浇注操作经验等等。这些技术组织措施都保证了钢锭的质量。但是，开始时，由于管理不严，特别是没有责任制度，厂里新工人多，技术措施常常不能认真贯彻，影响了钢的质量。
    为了使攻质量变成群众性的自觉运动，贵阳中心铸造厂近两月来进行了一系列的思想工作和组织工作。他们一方面向职工反复进行质量第一的思想教育，说明目前炼钢生产中如果没有质量就没有数量的道理；并在评比检查工作中，把质量都列为重要内容。另一方面，他们还采取了一些切实的组织措施来吸引和组织群众关心质量和监督质量。过去，他们的化验单只送给厂长或车间主任，没有和群众见面。现在他们建立了化验单下达现场的制度，保证炼三炉钢就检查一次，每次检查必须在半小时内得出结果，通知各工序的操作工人。这样就使全体职工时时刻刻注视着生产质量。
    在群众关心质量的基础上，他们进一步抓紧进行现场技术和质量教育。如有个工人不相信加锰砂的作用。车间领导就以两种做法、两种结果，拿出不同的化验结果交给大家讨论，进行对比分析。通过这些办法，职工们对每一项技术措施的意义有了比较深切的了解。执行起来也就自觉了。同时，车间还建立干部跟班把关制度和群众性的互相监督制度，从组织上保证了技术经验的贯彻执行。这个厂分工管炼钢的党委书记、厂长和炼钢车间主任、技术员坚持轮流跟班劳动，严格把守关口。另方面认真建立责任制，发动群众监督技术措施的执行。
