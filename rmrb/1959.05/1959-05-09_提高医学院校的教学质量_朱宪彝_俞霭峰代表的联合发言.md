Comrade Representatives:
	We fully agree with and warmly support Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

	Now, regarding how to improve the quality of higher medical education and how to cultivate higher-quality medical talents for the country, I would like to share our understanding and experiences.

	With the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, higher medical education has also greatly developed under the correct leadership of the Party. Especially after the great rectification movement, the implementation of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor; the establishment and consolidation of the Party's leadership in higher medical education; the development of the study and scientific research of traditional Chinese medicine; and the criticism of bourgeois educational thought and academic viewpoints, a thriving new atmosphere has emerged in the field of higher medical education. In order to adapt to the development of the current socialist cause, especially the needs of the health services of the vast people's communes, our Hebei Province followed the instruction of "running undertakings diligently and thriftily" and used the method of "walking on two legs" to expand the enrollment of the original two medical colleges and add new majors. In addition, six new medical colleges and medical vocational schools and two colleges of traditional Chinese medicine were built. In this way, each special zone in our province can have a higher medical college. This is the achievement of the great development of higher medical education in our province last year, and it is expected that it will be able to meet the needs of the people's health services in our province in terms of quantity. However, from a long-term perspective, in order to rapidly promote the level of medical science in our country, it is still necessary to cultivate higher-quality medical talents. Therefore, we very much agree with Premier Zhou's instruction to "pay special attention to improving the quality of various schools." We believe that higher medical education also "needs to be rectified, consolidated and improved on the basis of great development." Every medical college should also "take improving teaching quality as a regular and basic task, because only after the teaching quality is improved can the country cultivate medical cadres who not only master medical technology but also possess communist style, as well as teachers and scientific research talents who have a high theoretical level and are both red and expert." This is undoubtedly the common wish of comrades who are loyal to the Party's medical education cause, and they are willing to make the greatest efforts in this work.

	**Too Many Total Teaching Hours, Consider Extending the School System**

	I. The excessive burden on students caused by too many total teaching hours and a short school system is an important problem currently existing in higher medical education. The school system of the medical major in medical colleges is only five years, of which the last year is graduation internship. In four years, 38 required courses with 4,600 to 4,800 class hours have to be completed. This is obviously more than other types of higher education institutions. The total class hours of a four-year comprehensive university are generally 2,400 to 2,800. The five-year engineering major is generally 3,200 to 3,600 class hours.

	In terms of weekly class hours, engineering colleges generally have between 18 and 24, while medical colleges have between 30 and 36, which means that the average class hours per day are 5 to 6. Under such circumstances, students not only feel overburdened, but also lack time for self-study and independent thinking. In the basic medical study stage, there is not enough time and practice for experimental classes. In the clinical internship stage, there is not enough time to contact patients and participate in diagnostic and treatment work. When busy, there is no time to review lecture notes, let alone read reference books; when even busier, even the time for political class review and political and social activities is squeezed out. Few students can stick to physical exercise or recreational activities. It must be affirmed that the vast majority of medical students now are working hard to study and delve into their subjects, and teachers are also making great efforts to tutor students in their review work. However, these efforts have not been able to solve the problem of excessive burden on students. The main reason is that there are too many class hours and the school system is too short.

	In the past two years, the Central Ministry of Health has held several symposiums on the school system of higher medical colleges, and has made various considerations, but because there were only a little more than 30 higher medical colleges in the country at that time, and only 6,000 to 7,000 students graduated each year, it could not meet the urgent and large needs of the rapid development of national health services. However, since 1958, many newly built medical colleges, vocational schools, part-time medical schools, and colleges of traditional Chinese medicine with different school systems have emerged in various provinces and cities like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, which can cultivate a large number of medical cadres for the country. This has created favorable conditions for concentrating efforts on running a number of key schools well in order to improve the quality of higher medical education. Under today's new situation, in order to cultivate higher-quality medical talents for the country, extending the school system of a certain number of higher medical colleges to six years should be practical. On the premise of not increasing the total class hours, the teaching plan should be readjusted to ensure that the weekly class hours are within 25, giving students sufficient time for self-study and independent thinking.

	**Open Attached High Schools or Pre-Medical Courses**

	II. At the same time, can we consider higher medical colleges to run attached high schools or pre-medical courses? According to the teaching plan of medical colleges, adjust the curriculum of attached high schools or pre-medical courses, so that students can learn seven courses such as politics, Chinese, foreign languages, mathematics, biology, physics, and chemistry well in three years. Ensure that students can read foreign language professional reference books after one and a half years of professional study after entering medical colleges. Biology is the foundation of medicine, and the proportion it occupies in the teaching plan should be higher than that required by general high schools. Although the class hours of mathematics, physics, and chemistry can be a little less than those of engineering and science, they should not be reduced too much. In terms of teaching equipment, arrangements should also be made according to the above requirements, so that students can get full training opportunities in the laboratory.

	**Strengthen the Faculty of Basic Medicine, Cultivate Teachers of Basic Medicine**

	III. Strengthening the faculty of basic medicine and vigorously cultivating teachers of basic medicine is another important measure to improve the quality of medical education. In the past, we were relatively weak in this regard. This is a problem left to us by the historical conditions of the old society. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, the Ministry of Health has run several training courses for teachers of basic medicine, which has initially solved the needs of some colleges, but the quantity and quality cannot meet the current needs. In the future, we still need to vigorously cultivate them, first enrich the basic medical teaching and research groups of key medical colleges. Select excellent lecturers or senior teaching assistants to study and further their studies in domestic and foreign colleges with better conditions. Colleges with conditions should still run training courses for teachers of basic medicine. And vigorously carry out relevant scientific research work and academic activities. We hope that senior researchers in medical scientific research institutions can spare some time to guide or participate in the basic medical teaching work of medical colleges in or near their location.

	**Strengthen the Affiliated Hospitals of Medical Colleges**

	IV. Strengthening the affiliated hospitals of medical colleges and improving their medical quality is also an important link in improving the quality of higher medical education. The work of affiliated hospitals is relatively heavy and complex, because it is not only a clinical internship base, with the task of clinical teaching, but also undertakes medical business and scientific research work. Clinical teachers must take into account all three aspects of work at the same time. As long as these three types of work are arranged properly and combined well, there will be no contradictions, and they can play a mutually complementary and mutually promoting role, which is of great benefit to medical treatment, teaching, and scientific research, and is welcomed by the majority of teachers and students. However, if the arrangement is not appropriate, especially if the amount of medical business is too heavy, it will form a deviation of only focusing on medical treatment and failing to complete the teaching plan and adhere to teaching activities. This will increase the burden on teachers and students, thereby affecting the quality of teaching. As some teachers have reflected, "It doesn't matter if the work is a little busy, as long as there is time for lesson preparation and tutoring without delaying teaching." We believe that this statement is true and correct. To realize the wish that medical treatment, teaching, and scientific research are not neglected, first of all, of course, the hard work, practical work, and skillful work of the majority of teachers and students are required, but also the health leadership departments at all levels need to regularly care about the characteristics of affiliated hospitals and make reasonable adjustments to their work and staffing, and pay more attention to the improvement of medical quality. In terms of quantity, whether it can be moderate; so that its medical business, in nature and quantity, can meet the requirements of teaching; its teaching can be closely integrated with medical treatment and serve medical treatment; so that it can not only complete the teaching plan, but also play a role in medical treatment, prevention, and technical guidance. In this way, the current medical tasks are solved, and the long-term interests of cultivating higher-quality medical talents are taken into account.

	**Find Internship Bases for Preventive Medicine Courses**

	V. The teaching of preventive medicine courses also requires a certain teaching internship base, that is, to closely combine with the work of the epidemic prevention station in the location. According to the teaching plan, the urban and district epidemic prevention station designates a certain area, factories, mines, schools, and rural people's communes as internship places. Teachers and interns of relevant teaching and research groups jointly undertake the prevention and patriotic health movement work in each area. This not only embodies the spirit of prevention first, combining teaching with production, and combining teaching with mass movements in teaching, but also improves the quality of preventive medicine education.

	**Improve Teaching and Learning Methods**

	VI. Improving teaching and learning methods is also an important step in improving teaching quality. Under the leadership of the Party, teachers playing a leading role, strengthening tutoring and remedial classes (especially for worker-peasant students), as well as students' hard study and independent thinking, are equally important. Strictly implement the examination, assessment system, and promotion and graduation system, so that middle-level students can be transformed into excellent ones, and the number of failures is greatly reduced, which is the effort that the majority of teachers and students should make. It should be considered that it is wrong to accommodate failing students and give them all three points, and it is even more irresponsible to let failing students muddle through promotion or graduation.

	**Improve Enrollment Standards**

	VII. Improving enrollment standards is also an important thing in promoting the quality of higher medical education. First of all, attention should be paid to the political ideology of candidates and the large-scale recruitment of worker-peasant students (including attached high schools or preparatory courses). In terms of business, foreign languages should be listed as a compulsory subject, in addition, courses such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology must each be above 60 points, and the average score must not be less than 75. Students who fail in one subject should also be considered for remedial opportunities, and can be admitted after passing the re-examination. Worker-peasant students can be given special training classes to carry out specialized training, appropriately relax the time limit, and ensure that the examination results are passing. Medical colleges have heavy learning tasks, long learning periods, and the work they undertake after graduation is relatively heavy, and they cannot persist without a healthy physique, so the health status of candidates should also be strictly assessed. It is said that some people think that candidates who are not in good health cannot enter engineering colleges, but can enter medical colleges to study and treat diseases at the same time, which kills two birds with one stone. This view is obviously incorrect.

	**Correct the View of Teaching and Learning**

	VIII. Correcting the view of teaching and learning, and clarifying the purpose of teaching and learning is the fundamental issue in improving teaching quality. Under the guidance of the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, when arranging teaching, internships, and graduation internships, we should always pay attention to the equal importance of medical treatment and prevention, so that our students can learn modern medical technology in urban hospitals, and can also go to factories and rural areas to solve general medical and preventive problems for the vast people. So that they can become medical cadres with multiple skills and all-round development.

	**Adjust the Curriculum of Key Medical Colleges**

	IX. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of medical scientific research in our country, it is necessary to adjust the curriculum of key medical colleges and add courses such as biophysics, radiological medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine, so as to lay a favorable foundation for future attacks on cutting-edge medical science.

	Please correct the above opinions if they are appropriate.

	We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, this desire to improve higher medical education for the purpose of cultivating higher quality can be realized. As medical education workers, we must exert greater strength in this work.

	Finally, we want to warn British imperialism and foreign reactionaries to immediately stop the evil act of splitting Tibet from China. Tibet will always be the people of China.

### 提高医学院校的教学质量  朱宪彝　俞霭峰代表的联合发言

专栏：

　　提高医学院校的教学质量
    朱宪彝　俞霭峰代表的联合发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意并热烈拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理，李先念副总理及彭真副委员长的报告。
    现就如何提高高等医学教育质量，如何为国家培养出更高质量的医学人才，谈谈我们的认识和体会。
    随着一九五八年工农业大跃进的形势，高等医学教育事业，在党的正确领导下，也有了很大的发展。特别是经过伟大的整风运动，贯彻执行了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针；树立并巩固了党在高等医学教育中的领导；开展了祖国医学的学习和科学研究；批判了资产阶级教育思想和学术观点之后，在高等医学教育领域中出现了一片欣欣向荣的新气象。为适应当前社会主义事业的发展，特别是广大人民公社的保健事业的需要，我们河北省遵照了“勤俭办事业”的指示，运用了“两条腿走路”的方法，使原有的两所医学院校扩大招生并增设了专业，此外还新建了六所医学院和医学专科学校和两所中医学院。这样，我省每一个专区就能有一所高等医学院校。这是我省去年一年高等医学教育大发展中的成绩，预计在数量上将能满足我省人民保健事业的需要。但是从长远的利益看来，为迅速促进我国医学科学水平着想，还需要培养更高质量的医学人才。因此我们非常同意周总理所作“特别注意提高各类学校质量”的指示。我们认为高等医学教育也“需要在大发展的基础上进行整顿，巩固和提高”。每个医学院校也应该“把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务，因为只有在教学质量提高后，才能为国家培养出既掌握医疗技术又具备共产主义风格的德才兼备的医务干部，以及有较高理论水平的又红又专的教师和科学研究人才。这无疑的是忠于党的医学教育事业的同志们的共同的愿望，并愿意在这工作上尽最大的努力。
    教学总时数过多，可考虑延长学制
    一、因教学总时数过多，学制较短而形成的学生负担过重是目前存在高等医学教育中的一个重要问题。医学院校医疗系的学制仅五年，其中最末一年是毕业实习。在四年期间，所要学完的是三十八门必修课程的四千六百至四千八百学时。这显见是比其他类型的高等学校多。四年制综合性大学总学时数一般为二千四百至二千八百。五年制理工专业一般为三千二百至三千六百学时。
    在周学时数上，理工学院一般在十八至二十四之间，而医学院校却在三十至三十六之间，那就是说每天平均学时数为五至六。在这样情况下，学生不但感到负担过重，且缺乏自学及独立思考的时间。在基础医学学习阶段，实验课的时间和锻炼不够。在临床实习阶段，接触病人及参加诊疗工作实践的时间不够。忙时连复习讲义的时间都没有，更谈不上看参考书了；再忙一点，连政治课复习及政治社会活动时间都被挤掉了。很少学生能坚持体育锻炼或文娱活动。必须肯定的是现在医学院的学生绝大多数都是努力学习，刻苦钻研的，教师们也在辅导学生复习的工作上尽很大的努力。但是这些努力并未能解决学生负担过重问题。主要是因为学时多了一些，学制短了一些。
    在过去两年中，中央卫生部曾为高等医学院校学制问题召开过几次座谈会，作过多方面的考虑，但是因为当时全国仅有高等医学院校三十几所，每年毕业学生不过六、七千人，不能满足全国保健事业飞跃发展的迫切而大量的需要。但自一九五八年起，许多不同学制的新建医学院校，专科学校，业余医学校，中医学院，如雨后春笋在各省市出现，可以为国家培养出大量的医务干部。这就为提高高等医学教育质量而集中力量办好一批重点学校创造了有利条件。在今天的新形势下，为了为国家培养更高质量的医学人才而使一定数量的高等医学院校延长学制为六年应该是切合实际的。在不增加总学时数的前提下，重新调整教学计划，保证周学时数在二十五以内，给学生以足够的自习及独立思考的时间。
    开办附属高中或医预科
    二、与此同时，是否可以考虑高等医学院校办理附属高中或医预科。根据医学院校的教学计划，调整附中或医预科的课程，便能在三年内学好政治，国文，外文，数学，生物学，物理，化学等七门课程。保证学生在入医学院后，经一年半载的专业学习，就可以阅读外文专业参考书。生物学是医学的基础，在教学计划中所占的比重应比一般高中所要求的高。数学、物理、化学的时数虽然可以比理工科少一点但也不宜削减太多。在教学设备方面也应按上述要求进行安排，使学生能在实验室中得到充分培养锻炼的机会。
  加强基础医学阵容、培养基础医学师资
    三、加强基础医学阵容，大力培养基础医学师资是提高医学教育质量的另一个重要措施。过去，我们在这方面是比较薄弱的。是旧社会历史条件给我们留下的问题。解放后，在党的正确领导下，卫生部曾经办过几期基础医学师资训练班，初步解决了一些院校的需要，但是在数量及质量上还不能满足目前的需要。今后还需要大力培养，首先充实各重点医学院校基础医学教研组。选拔优秀讲师或高级助教到国内、外条件较好的院校进修深造。有条件的院校仍应开办基础医学师资训练班。并大力开展有关的科学研究工作及学术活动，我们希望医学科学研究机构的高级研究人员能匀出一部分时间指导或参加所在地或附近的医学院校的基础医学教学工作。
    加强医学院校的附属医院
    四、加强医学院校的附属医院，提高它的医疗质量也是提高高等医学教育质量的重要环节。附属医院的工作是比较繁重，复杂的，因为它不仅是临床实习基地，有临床教学的任务，而且还担任着医疗业务，及科学研究工作。临床教师必须同时兼顾三方面的工作。这三种工作，只要安排的合适，结合的好，是不会有矛盾的，而且还能起到相辅相成，相互促进作用，对医疗、教学及科研都有很大的好处，向为广大师生所欢迎。但如安排的不合适，特别是医疗业务量过重，就会形成只顾医疗而未能完成教学计划，坚持教学活动的偏差。这样就会增加师生负担，从而影响教学质量。正如有些教师反映的一样，“工作忙一点，没有关系，只要有备课、辅导的时间而不耽误教学就行。”我们认为这种说法还是真实，还是正确的。要实现医疗、教学、科研三不误的愿望，首先当然需要广大师生的苦干、实干、巧干，但也需要各级卫生领导部门经常关怀附属医院的特点，对它的工作及人员编制进行合理的调整，多注意到医疗质量的提高。在数量上是否可以适可而止；使它的医疗业务，在性质上，在数量上，都能适应教学的要求；它的教学能密切结合医疗，为医疗服务；使它既能完成教学计划，又能在医疗、预防及技术指导上起到应起的作用。这样既解决了目前的医疗任务，又照顾到了培养较高质量的医学人才的长远利益。
    给预防医学课程找实习基地
    五、预防医学课程的教学也需要一定的教学实习的基地，那就是和所在地的防疫站的工作密切结合起来，根据教学计划，由市区防疫站指定一定的地段，厂矿、学校和农村人民公社作为实习的场所。有关教研组的教师和实习生共同担负起各该地的预防和爱国卫生运动工作。这样不仅在教学中体现了预防为主，教学与生产相结合，教学与群众运动相结合的精神，同时也提高了预防医学教育的质量。
    改进教与学的方法
    六、改进教与学的方法也是提高教学质量的重要步骤。在党的领导下，教师起主导作用，加强辅导及补习，（特别是对工农学生）以及学生的刻苦钻研、独立思考，有着同等的重要性，严格执行考试，考查制度及升级和毕业制度，以便中流学生能转化为优秀，不及格的大大减少，是广大师生应尽的努力，应该认为迁就不及格的学生，一律给予三分是不对头的，而让不及格的学生凑合升级或毕业，更是不负责任的。
    提高招生标准
    七、提高招生标准在促进高等医学教育质量中也是一项重要的事情。首先应该注意到的是考生的政治思想，大量招收工农学生（包括附中或预科在内）。在业务方面，外文应列为必考科目，此外数学，物理，化学，生物学等课程必须各在六十分以上，平均分数不得少于七十五。对一门不及格应考学生也要考虑补习机会，经复试及格后可以入学。对工农学生可以设补习班进行专科培养，适当放宽期限，保证考试成绩及格。医学院校学习任务繁重，学习期限较长，毕业后所担任的工作又比较繁重，如果没有健全的体格是不能坚持的，因此考生的健康情况也应给予严格的考核。听说有些人认为身体不太好的考生入理工学院不行，入医学院后可以一面学习，一面治病，一举两得，这种看法显见是不正确的。
    端正教与学的观点
    八、端正教与学的观点，明确教与学的目的是提高教学质量的根本问题。在教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合方针的指导下，在安排教学，实习及毕业实习的时候，时刻注意到医疗预防并重，使我们的同学既能在城市医院学到现代化的医疗技术，又能下厂，下乡，为广大人民解决一般医疗预防问题。使他们能成为一专多能全面发展的医务干部。
    调整重点医学院校的课程
    九、为了满足我国医学科学研究飞跃发展的需要，就有必要对重点医学院校的课程进行调整，增设生物物理，放射医学及祖国医学等课程，这样才能为今后向尖端医学科学进攻奠定有利的基础。
    以上意见，是否恰当，请各位代表指正。
    我们深信，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，这个为培养更高质量而提高高等医学教育的愿望是可以实现的。作为医学教育工作者的我们一定要在这项工作上发挥更大的力量。
    最后，我们要在这里警告英帝国主义和外国反动派，立即停止那种把西藏从中国分裂出去的罪恶行动，西藏永远是中国人民的。
