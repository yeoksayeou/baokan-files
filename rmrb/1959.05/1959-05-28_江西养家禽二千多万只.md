Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi's poultry production has greatly developed. Currently, the province has over 23 million chickens, ducks, geese and other poultry. Among these, 90% are raised by commune members privately or by production teams.

Since the spring of this year, Jiangxi has launched a mass movement to hatch poultry in thousands of households. From the Gan Nan Administrative Region to the Shangrao and Jiujiang Special Districts, committees from the regional to the commune level have established offices to lead livestock and poultry production or non-staple food production. Each production team has a cadre specifically in charge of this work. Yugan County has adopted the measure of "everyone pitching in, one chicken coop per household," and now the county has hatched more than 170,000 chicks.

With the great development of poultry production, the broad masses of commune members in various places are doing everything possible to find feed. Generally, they are adopting methods such as digging earthworms, collecting snails, utilizing wild plants and processing green leaves, and digging pits to cultivate insects, opening up sources of feed. Some communes in some areas have also allocated small plots of land for commune members to grow feed. Local grain departments have also successively allocated more than 100,000 jin of various feeds to solve the problem of insufficient concentrated feed for young poultry in some areas.

    江西养家禽二千多万只
    据新华社讯  江西家禽生产有很大发展。目前全省已有鸡、鸭、鹅等家禽二千三百多万只。其中90％是社员私人或生产小队饲养的。
    今年春季以来，江西各地开展了千家万户的孵禽运动。赣南行政区和上饶、九江等专区从地委到公社，都成立了领导家畜家禽生产或副食品生产的办公机构，各生产队都有一个干部专管这个工作。余干县采取了“人人动手，每户一窝鸡”的措施，现在全县已孵了小鸡十七万多只。
    家禽生产大大发展后，各地广大社员千方百计地寻找饲料。一般采取挖蚯蚓、捞田螺、利用野生植物和青叶加工制造以及挖坑沤虫的办法，开辟了饲料来源。有些地区的公社还拨出了小块土地给社员种植饲料。各地粮食部门也先后拨出了各种饲料十万余斤，解决部分地区雏禽精料不足的问题。
