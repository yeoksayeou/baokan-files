Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, May 12th (TASS dispatch): The domestic situation in the Soviet Union is excellent, and the international situation facing our country is now better than ever. This was stated by Khrushchev on May 11th at the ceremony in Kiev awarding the Ukrainian Republic the Order of Lenin. The Ukrainian Republic was awarded the Order of Lenin for its significant achievements in increasing agricultural production.

In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union's prestige in all matters has increased immensely. The powerful socialist camp is strengthening year by year.

Referring to the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Khrushchev said that we have made all preparations to enable our Foreign Minister Gromyko to achieve positive results in Geneva.

Khrushchev said that the people of all countries expect a thaw and a relaxation of international tensions. The Foreign Ministers' Meeting will be the first step in this effort. He added, "I believe that as long as we work together, we can improve the situation."

Khrushchev continued, if the Foreign Ministers' Meeting does not achieve significant positive results, the next step will be to look forward to a summit meeting of heads of government. Khrushchev pointed out that it appears that this meeting will take place.

Khrushchev said that Mr. Macmillan has become an advocate of meetings between heads of government. According to the information we have, Mr. Eisenhower also leans towards the view that such a meeting must be held. We have been told that President de Gaulle has also concluded that a high-level meeting is appropriate, because a series of matured problems might be solved at a high-level meeting. Khrushchev added, "But all these people are cautious when talking about this issue, because each of them wants to leave himself an out."

Khrushchev said that, of course, it is impossible to solve all problems in one meeting. We hope that all disputed or unresolved issues will be resolved without war.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's achievements in peaceful development are what the imperialists are particularly afraid of now. However, they are powerless to stop our progress.

Khrushchev said, "We want to tell those who are keen on war adventures: do not offend us, and we will never offend you. We will do everything possible to develop peaceful cooperation with other countries, thereby creating conditions conducive to ensuring lasting peace for the Soviet Union and lasting peace for all countries."

Khrushchev pointed out that Soviet scientists, in cooperation with engineers and the working class, have created excellent military technical equipment. "We have good rockets, and we have enough of them. But, we see that we don't need that many rockets. Perhaps, before long, we will start reducing rocket production." Speaking about the domestic situation, Khrushchev said that the Soviet state has taken a big step forward in these years.

    赫鲁晓夫在乌克兰授勋典礼上讲话
    人们期待国际气候转暖
    外长会议应当有所成就
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社基辅12日讯：苏联的国内情况很好，我国所面临的国际形势现在比过去任何时候都好，这是赫鲁晓夫11日在基辅举行的授给乌克兰共和国以列宁勋章的典礼上所说的。乌克兰共和国由于在农业增产方面取得重大成就而荣获列宁勋章。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出，苏联在一切事务上的威信无比提高了。强大的社会主义阵营一年比一年加强。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到日内瓦外长会议时说，我们已作好一切准备来使我们的外交部长葛罗米柯能够在日内瓦取得积极的结果。
    赫鲁晓夫说，各国人民期待转暖，期待国际紧张局势缓和。外长会议将是这方面努力的第一步。他补充说，我认为，只要我们共同努力，就能够改善局势。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，如果外长会议没有取得很大的积极结果，下一步就要期待举行政府首脑会议了。赫鲁晓夫指出，看来，这个会议是会举行的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，麦克米伦先生成了政府首脑会见的拥护者。根据我们掌握的材料，艾森豪威尔先生也倾向于必须举行这种会见的主张。有人转告我们说，戴高乐总统也得出结论，认为举行高级会议是适宜的，因为在高级会议上可能会解决一系列成熟了的问题。赫鲁晓夫补充说，但是所有这些人士在谈这个问题时都是小心翼翼的，因为他们每一个人都想为自己留后路。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当然，在一次会见中不可能解决所有的问题。我们希望一切争端问题或悬而未决的问题都在不发生战争的情况下得到解决。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联在和平发展方面的成就，是现在帝国主义者特别害怕的事。可是，他们无力阻止我们前进。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们要告诉那些热衷于战争冒险的人：不要触犯我们，而我们也永远不触犯你们。我们尽一切努力发展同其他国家的和平合作，从而创造有助于保证苏联的持久和平和一切国家的持久和平的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联科学家在同工程技术人员和工人阶级协作下创造了优良的军事技术装备。我们有很好的火箭，并且有足够的数量。但是，我们看到，我们并不需要那么多的火箭。也许，再过不久，我们将开始缩减火箭的生产。赫鲁晓夫在谈到国内情况时说，苏维埃国家在这些年中前进了一大步。
