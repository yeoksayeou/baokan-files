Xinhua News Agency, 9th – Ambassador Li Yong-ho of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China stated at a press conference held today for Chinese and foreign journalists that the Japanese authorities cannot evade their inescapable responsibility for enabling the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, no matter what excuses they use. The ambassador briefed the Chinese and foreign journalists on the negotiations taking place in Geneva between the Red Cross delegations of both North Korea and Japan regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, and sternly condemned the various conspiracies of the Japanese authorities to unreasonably obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho refuted the absurd argument recently put forward by the Japanese side that the issue of repatriation of Korean residents in Japan is a "domestic matter" belonging to Japan's internal affairs. He said: The Japanese authorities have the obligation to give Korean residents the freedom to choose their place of residence and to allow Korean citizens who wish to return home to do so; and we have the obligation to protect their human rights. Is it the case that the occurrence of events that disregard human rights and suppress the will of Korean residents in Japan to return home is also a domestic matter of Japan, and is not allowed to be interfered with or questioned? He pointed out that the issue of repatriation of Korean residents in Japan should always be resolved by North Korea and Japan through consultation.

The ambassador pointed out that at the beginning of the Geneva talks, the Japanese side stubbornly insisted on the so-called "confirmation of will," attempting to conduct insulting so-called "screening" of returnees gathered at the port of departure based on their firm will to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a practice not even applied to prisoners of war. Due to repeated reasoned rebuttals from the Korean side, the Japanese side had to withdraw its proposals regarding "confirmation of will" and "screening" during the fourth and fifth meetings. However, disregarding the agreements already reached, the Japanese side even claimed that the International Committee of the Red Cross should have "adjudication rights," attempting to abuse the rights and status of the International Committee of the Red Cross to further thoroughly conduct the so-called "confirmation of will" and "screening." In this way, the repatriation work of Korean residents in Japan will face chaos and be sabotaged.

The ambassador said that the talks between the Red Cross delegations of North Korea and Japan began on April 13 this year, and twelve meetings have been held so far, but due to the Japanese side's stubborn insistence on incorrect positions, the talks have not made due progress to date.

He pointed out that the vast majority of Korean citizens remaining in Japan were forced to go to Japan by the Japanese aggressors during World War II through barbaric means such as forced conscription and forced labor. Now, 80% of them are unemployed and live in great suffering. He said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will never remain indifferent to the Japanese authorities' trampling on the human rights of Korean residents in Japan and their conspiracies to obstruct their repatriation.

The ambassador concluded by saying that the Japanese side's various incorrect stances that obstruct the early progress of the talks and complicate the issue will inevitably be opposed by the Korean people and condemned by fair-minded public opinion around the world.

### 李永镐大使举行记者招待会  谴责日政府阻挠朝鲜侨民归国

　　李永镐大使举行记者招待会
    谴责日政府阻挠朝鲜侨民归国
    新华社9日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐在今天举行的中外记者招待会上说，日本当局利用任何借口也无法逃避应该使旅日朝鲜侨民回国的不可推卸的责任。大使向中外记者介绍了朝日双方红十字会代表团正在日内瓦就旅日朝鲜侨民回国问题进行谈判的情况，严厉地谴责日本当局企图无理阻挠旅日朝鲜侨民回国的种种阴谋。
    李永镐大使驳斥了日本方面最近提出的旅日朝鲜侨民回国问题是属于日本内政的“国内问题”的荒谬论点。他说：日本当局有义务给朝鲜侨民选择居住地的自由，使希望归国的朝鲜公民归国；而我们则有义务维护他们的人权。难道发生无视人权，镇压旅日朝鲜侨民归国意志的事，也是日本的国内问题，不许干涉，不许过问吗？他指出，旅日朝鲜侨民的归国问题，任何时候都应该由朝日两国通过协商解决。
    大使指出，日本方面在日内瓦会谈开始的初期就固执地坚持所谓“确认意志”这一不正确的主张，企图对以坚决返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的意志为基础而集结到启程港口的归国人员，进行甚至不适用于战争俘虏的侮辱性的所谓“甄别”。由于朝鲜方面一再地据理反驳，日方不得不在第四次和第五次会谈中撤回了有关“确认意志”和“甄别”的提案。但是，日本方面不顾已经达成的协议，竟然又声称红十字国际委员会应该具有“裁决权”，企图滥用红十字国际委员会的权利和地位，进一步彻底进行所谓“确认意志”和“甄别”。这样，旅日朝鲜侨民的归国工作就将面临混乱，遭到破坏。
    大使说，朝日两国红十字会代表团的会谈从今年4月13日开始，到目前已进行了十二次，但是由于日本方面固执地坚持不正确的立场，会谈至今没有取得应有的进展。
    他指出，留在日本的朝鲜公民绝大部分都是在第二次世界大战中被日本侵略者以强制征兵、强迫拉伕等野蛮手段迫使到日本去的。现在他们当中80％的人都没有职业，生活十分痛苦。他说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国对于日本当局蹂躏旅日朝鲜侨民的人权和阻挠他们回国的阴谋，决不会置若罔闻。
    大使最后说，日本方面阻挠会谈早日进展和使问题复杂化的种种不正确立场，不仅不可避免地会遭到朝鲜人民的反对，而且也会遭到世界公正舆论的谴责。
