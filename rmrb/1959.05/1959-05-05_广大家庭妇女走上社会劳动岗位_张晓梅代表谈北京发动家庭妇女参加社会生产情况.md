I warmly support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

I would like to express some opinions on the mobilization of housewives in Beijing to participate in social production and the establishment of collective welfare undertakings.

	More Than 190,000 Housewives Directly Participate in Socialist Construction
	I. More than 190,000 housewives have taken up social production and labor positions, playing an active role in socialist construction. During the Great Leap Forward last year, on the ideological foundation of unprecedented improvement in the people's rectification and socialist consciousness, the broad masses of housewives urgently requested to participate in social labor. As of March this year, 200,000 street residents had participated in various socialist construction undertakings, of which housewives accounted for more than 190,000. Among these 190,000 people, about a quarter went to factories, basic construction, and commercial departments as apprentices, laborers, and salespersons, and three-quarters participated in production and service undertakings organized on the streets.

	Under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the support of relevant departments, after a vigorous mass movement, more than 400 street factories and more than 2,900 street production groups were established in a short period of time. These productions included dozens of industries and more than 200 kinds of products. The productions with a larger number of people involved are special handicrafts such as drawnwork, embroidery, gold lacquer inlay, cloisonné, sewing, shoemaking, bookbinding, cardboard boxes, toys, spinning yarn, spinning wool, and glass products.

	Housewives are a huge human resource. Organizing this part of the force to participate in various social labor activities has played an active role in solving the shortage of labor force that emerged after the Great Leap Forward, helping factories and communes to complete their production leap plans, increasing national wealth, and accelerating socialist construction. For example, more than 6,000 family members of employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were organized to participate in auxiliary labor within the plant, solving the problem of partial labor shortage of the plant. The Beijing Hat Factory, by handing over relatively simple processes to more than 1,500 street women for off-site processing and putting the plant's workforce on important processes, continuously improved production efficiency, and the output value in the first quarter of this year increased more than threefold compared with the same period last year. More than 10,000 women in the city participated in the production of special handicrafts such as drawnwork, embroidery, cloisonné, and gold lacquer inlay. Last year alone, the output value of drawnwork and embroidery reached more than 9.6 million yuan, which played a certain role in completing the national plan. At the same time, many products were made using factory scraps and various waste materials. For example, making flexible belts from scrap leather, making calcium carbonate from lime residue, and making collar hooks, trouser hooks, shoe eyelets, springs, and keys from scrap materials. These are all products that are urgently needed in current industrial and agricultural production and people's daily lives. Especially since the second half of last year, after some state-owned factories and handicraft cooperatives that produced the above-mentioned products switched to producing other more important products, street production organizations replaced part of the production tasks of factories and communes in this area, timely supplying the needs of the market and playing a significant role.

	Through production practice, their ideological awareness has been further improved. Under the encouragement of the all-round work Great Leap Forward, and like workers, peasants, and employees fighting on various fronts, they fully demonstrated the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, being tenacious and hardworking, and are full of vigor and high morale. In the absence of factory buildings, equipment, and funds, many women built their own factory buildings, built their own equipment, and started many factories from scratch. In production, they diligently studied and practiced, quickly mastered the technology, and initially learned to manage production. They have also made contributions to technical innovation, improved tools, and improved labor efficiency. For example, the Tianqiao Red Flag Leather Shoe Factory has realized semi-mechanization of more than half of its processes within just half a year of starting operations.

	Now most of these street-run production organizations have gradually been consolidated, production efficiency is constantly improving, the people participating in production also have relatively stable incomes, and most production units have a certain amount of accumulation.

	After more than half a year of practice, although we have gained some experience in organizing street production, there are still many problems. The task in the future is to further consolidate and improve. The direction of production should focus on processing, serving industrial production and the needs of urban people's lives. At present, some street production organizations are linking up with state-owned factories, handicraft cooperatives, and commercial departments according to their requirements, and signing processing contracts in order to consolidate production tasks, incorporate them into the national plan, and properly solve the problems of technical equipment and raw material supply. Production units should strengthen management, establish and improve some necessary systems, and continuously educate production personnel to improve technology and production efficiency, and ensure quality. In terms of labor arrangement, we believe that it is necessary to take into account the characteristics of housewives, and adopt flexible and diverse methods such as centralized production and decentralized production, full-day labor and half-day labor, so that some women with heavy household burdens and weak bodies can also participate. Special attention should be paid to the special problems of pregnancy, maternity leave, and breastfeeding.

	Vigorously Develop Collective Welfare Undertakings
	II. With the development of production and the needs of the masses, collective welfare undertakings are vigorously developed. After the broad masses of housewives actively invested in production during the Great Leap Forward, they urgently demanded to solve household problems such as childcare and cooking. Therefore, while developing production, collective welfare undertakings have also been established in large numbers. At present, there are more than 1,250 street kindergartens and nurseries in the city, accommodating more than 60,000 children, an increase of two times compared with 1957. Six hundred and seventy street canteens have been set up, with more than 46,000 people participating. In addition, more than 230 neighborhood service stations and service organizations such as dismantling, washing, sewing, and mending have been established. With their own efforts, under the care of the Party and the government, and with the support of the society, these collective welfare undertakings have been gradually consolidated and improved, playing a great role in relieving the tedious housework of the broad masses of women and consolidating and developing production. With the advance of production and needs, welfare undertakings will inevitably continue to expand and develop.

	According to our experience, to run these collective welfare undertakings well, we must rely on the strength of the masses and let the masses run them themselves, and be both active and based on the needs of the masses and the specific conditions of the local area. We must adopt a variety of forms that are convenient for the masses, such as childcare organizations with full-day, half-day, and full-time care, and stipulate the time for care according to the time parents participate in production. In terms of regional distribution, we should ensure that most women can send their children to care nearby. Only in this way can we promote the development of production, arrange life well, and enable the broad masses of women to play a greater role in the future socialist construction.

	Changed Spiritual Outlook, Improved Living Standards and Social Status
	III. After housewives participate in production, they change their spiritual outlook, improve their living standards and social status. The broad masses of housewives participate in social labor and production, which has caused a series of huge changes in their own spiritual outlook, material life, and social status, as well as the face of the entire society.

	The social ethos of "Labor is glorious, not laboring is shameful" and "Everything is for socialist construction" has begun to be established. In April and May of last year, more than 50,000 women from urban streets volunteered to support agricultural production. In September and October, they actively went to the countryside to support the autumn harvest, reaching more than 81,000 person-times. At the same time, more than 4,000 housewives went to the suburbs to dig sand and gravel to support the capital's basic construction. The housewives who participated in social labor are in a good mood and full of enthusiasm. Because they have made contributions to the country and the people, they are increasingly and universally respected. Many people have been promoted to factory directors and heads of production groups. Some advanced elements have also been admitted to the Party and become glorious Communist Party members. For example, in the 20 street factories and 150 production groups of the Beixinqiao Office, except for two units, all are led by housewives as factory directors and group leaders. Six women have been admitted as Communist Party members after being trained and educated by the Party.

	After housewives participate in production, they have labor income and improve their family life. The general family relationship is more intimate and harmonious than before, and there is mutual care and consideration between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, establishing a democratic, harmonious, joyful, and happy family life. Imperialist elements slander us for destroying the family. The fact is just the opposite. Our family life is happier and more harmonious. What has been destroyed is only the feudal patriarchal system left over from the old society, and what has been abolished is only the unequal status of men and women for thousands of years. The phenomenon of quarreling due to daily trivial matters between neighbors has been greatly reduced. In particular, many large courtyards, because there are many households living together, often quarreled and were not united due to small things in life in the past. Today, because of common labor and mutual assistance, they have become united courtyards and become a big family. This reflects that in our society, the relationship between people is changing, and communist morality is growing.

	In just a few months, more than 190,000 housewives have been organized to participate in production and social labor, and collective welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, canteens, and neighborhood service stations have been established in large numbers, which is a great initiative. This not only creates favorable conditions for the complete liberation of women, but also has an extremely important impact on the change of social atmosphere, and plays a certain role in changing Beijing from a consumer city to a production city.

    广大家庭妇女走上社会劳动岗位
    张晓梅代表谈北京发动家庭妇女参加社会生产情况
    我热烈拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    我现在就北京市发动家庭妇女参加社会生产和举办集体福利事业问题发表一些意见。
    十九万多家庭妇女直接
    参加了社会主义建设事业
    一、十九万多家庭妇女，走上社会生产劳动的岗位，在社会主义建设中发挥了积极作用。在去年的大跃进当中，在全民整风、社会主义觉悟空前提高的思想基础上，广大家庭妇女迫切要求参加社会劳动。截至今年三月，街道居民有二十万人参加了各种社会主义建设事业，其中家庭妇女就占十九万多人。在这十九万多人当中，约有四分之一到工厂、基本建设和商业部门作学徒工、壮工和售货员，有四分之三参加了街道上组织的生产事业和服务事业。
    在党和政府的领导下，在各有关部门的支持下，经过轰轰烈烈的群众运动，在短短几个月的时间就办起了四百多个街道工厂，两千九百多个街道生产组。这些生产包括了几十种行业，二百多种产品。生产人数较多的有挑补绣花、金漆镶嵌、景泰蓝等特种工艺品、缝纫、制鞋、装订、纸盒、玩具、纺线、纺毛、玻璃制品等。
    家庭妇女是一个巨大的人力资源，把这部分力量组织起来参加各种社会劳动，对于解决全民大跃进以后出现的劳动力不足的现象，帮助厂、社完成生产跃进计划，增加国家财富，加速社会主义建设都起了积极作用。如石景山钢铁厂有六千多职工家属组织起来参加厂内的辅助劳动，解决了该厂部分劳动力不足的问题。北京制帽厂，由于把比较简单的工序交给街道妇女一千五百余人进行厂外加工，把厂内工人的力量放到重要的工序上，生产效率不断提高，今年第一季度比去年同期产值增加了三倍多。全市有一万多妇女参加挑补绣花、景泰蓝、金漆镶嵌等特种手工艺生产，去年一年仅挑补绣花一项产值即达九百六十余万元，对于完成国家计划，起了一定的作用。同时还有不少产品是利用工厂的下脚料和各种废旧物品制成的。例如利用碎皮子，做活络带，用石灰渣做碳酸钙，以及用碎料做的领钩、裤钩、鞋芊子、弹簧、钥匙等，这些都是当前工、农业生产和人民日常生活上迫切需要的产品。特别是从去年下半年，有些生产上述产品的国营工厂、手工业合作社，转为生产其他更重要的产品以后，街道生产组织在这方面代替了厂、社的部分生产任务，及时供应了市场的需要，起了显著的作用。
    通过生产的实践，她们的思想觉悟进一步提高了，在全面工作大跃进的鼓舞下，和工人、农民以及战斗在各个战线上的职工一样，充分发挥了敢想、敢干、顽强刻苦的精神，意气奋发、斗志昂扬。在没有厂房、设备、资金的条件下，不少妇女自盖厂房，自搞设备、白手起家办起不少工厂。在生产中她们勤学苦练，很快掌握了技术，并初步学会了管理生产。在技术革新、改进工具、提高劳动效率方面，她们也作出了贡献，如天桥红旗皮鞋厂，在开工刚半年的期间内，就已经有半数以上的工序实现了半机械化。
    现在这些街道举办的生产组织多数逐渐巩固了，生产效率正在不断的提高，参加生产的人也有了比较稳定的收入，并且多数生产单位都有了一定的积累。
    经过半年多的实践，我们对于组织街道生产，虽然取得了一些经验，但是问题也还不少。今后的任务是进一步巩固和提高。生产的方向应当以加工为主，为工业生产和为城市人民生活的需要服务。目前有些街道生产组织正在根据国营工厂、手工业合作社和商业部门的要求，和他们挂钩，订立加工合同，以便把生产任务巩固下来，纳入国家计划，妥善的解决技术设备和原材料供应问题。生产单位要加强管理，建立和健全一些必要的制度，不断的教育生产人员提高技术和生产效率，保证质量。在劳动力安排方面，我们认为必须照顾家庭妇女的特点，分别采取集中生产和分散生产，整日劳动和半日劳动等灵活多样的方式，使一些家务负担较重、身体较弱的妇女也能参加。对于怀孕、产期、喂奶等特殊问题，更要注意照顾。大力举办集体生活福利事业
    二、随着生产的发展和群众的需要，大力举办集体生活福利事业。广大家庭妇女在大跃进中积极投入了生产以后，迫切地要求解决托儿、做饭等家务问题。因此在发展生产的同时，集体福利事业也大量的兴办起来，目前全市有街道幼儿园、托儿所一千二百五十多个，收托了六万多名儿童，比一九五七年增加两倍。办起了六百七十个街道食堂，入伙的有四万六千多人。另外还举办了二百三十多个邻里服务所、拆洗缝补等服务性组织。在她们自己的努力下，在党和政府的关怀和社会的支持下，这些集体福利事业已经逐步地巩固和健全起来，对解除多少年来广大妇女的繁琐家务劳动和巩固、发展生产起了很大的作用。随着生产的前进和需要，福利事业也必将继续扩大和发展。
    根据我们的经验，要办好这些集体生活福利事业必须依靠群众力量，由群众自办，既要积极，又要根据群众需要和当地的具体条件。要采取多种多样便利群众的形式，如托儿组织有整日制、半日制、全托，根据家长参加生产时间规定收托时间。在地区的分布上做到多数妇女都能就近送托孩子。这样才能促进生产的发展、安排好生活，使广大妇女在今后的社会主义建设事业中发挥出更大的力量。
    改变了精神面貌，提高了生活水平和社会地位
    三、家庭妇女参加生产后改变了精神面貌，提高了生活水平和社会地位。广大的家庭妇女参加了社会的劳动生产，不管对于她们自己的精神面貌、物质生活、社会地位来说或者整个社会的面貌来说，都引起了一系列的巨大的变化。
    “劳动光荣，不劳动可耻”和“一切为了社会主义建设”的社会风尚已经开始树立。去年四、五月间，城区街道妇女有五万多人义务劳动支援农业生产。九、十月间，又积极地到农村支援秋收，达八万一千多人次。同时又有四千多家庭妇女到郊区去挖砂石，支援首都的基本建设。参加了社会劳动的家庭妇女，心情舒畅，热情洋溢。由于她们为国家、为人民作出了贡献，日益普遍地受到了人们的尊重。有不少人已经被提升为工厂的厂长、生产组的负责人。有些先进分子还被吸收入党，成了光荣的共产党员。例如北新桥办事处的二十个街道工厂，一百五十个生产组中除两个单位外，都是由家庭妇女担任厂长、组长等领导职务的；有六个妇女经过党的培养教育，被吸收为共产党员。
    家庭妇女在参加生产后，有了劳动收入，改善了家庭生活。一般的家庭关系比以前更为亲密、和睦了，夫妻之间、婆媳之间互相关心、互相体贴，建立起民主、和睦、欢乐幸福的家庭生活。帝国主义分子胡说我们破坏了家庭，事实刚刚相反，我们的家庭生活是更加幸福、更加和睦了。被破坏了的只是旧社会遗留下来的封建家长制度，被取消了的只是几千年来男女的不平等的地位。在邻里之间过去的因日常琐事而争吵的现象已经大为减少。特别是许多大杂院因为同住的户数多，过去常因生活小事吵架闹不团结，今天由于共同劳动、相互帮助，变成了团结的大院，变成了一个大家庭。这反映了在我们的社会里，人与人的关系正在改变，共产主义道德正在生长。
    在短短的几个月中，十九万多家庭妇女组织起来参加生产，参加社会劳动，依靠群众大量举办托儿所、幼儿园、食堂、邻里服务所等集体福利事业，是一个伟大的创举，这不但为妇女的彻底解放创造了有利的条件，而且对社会风气的改变也有极其重大的影响，对于把北京从一个消费城市改变为生产城市也起了一定的作用。
