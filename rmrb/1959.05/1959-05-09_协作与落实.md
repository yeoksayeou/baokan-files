    Since the beginning of this year, with the strengthening of leadership over science and technology work by Party committees at all levels, science and technology departments in various regions, under the spirit of "the whole nation as a single chess game," in addition to undertaking some nationally important and key tasks based on their local capabilities and strengths, have also vigorously established and developed regional science and technology work based on the current requirements of local production and construction, as well as the foundation of science and technology work, arranging this year's tasks with emphasis while taking overall consideration. It can be seen that this type of regional science and technology work will gain rapid development throughout the country, and it will become a major feature of the continued great leap forward in the entire science and technology work this year. Now, the important issue in science and technology work is to properly solve the problem of collaboration. Organizing collaboration can arrange forces, adjust projects, create conditions, and make the indicators of various tasks fall on a reliable foundation, ensuring their realization, so as to promote the smooth development of regional science and technology work. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, in the process of specifically formulating this year's research projects, mobilized various scientific and technological research departments, institutions of higher learning, and relevant industrial departments to adopt the "six fixings" method for comprehensive collaboration. Such an approach can effectively solve problems and is worth referring to by other regions.
    At present, emphasizing collaboration in science and technology work has new significance compared to last year. This is primarily to meet the requirements of the current science and technology work tasks. In the great leap forward of science and technology work in 1958, although the ranks of science and technology were unprecedentedly strengthened and received training and improvement, and experimental equipment and instruments also greatly increased, the strength still seems insufficient for the current heavy tasks. In particular, some key research projects with systematic and comprehensive nature require the concerted cooperation of relevant scientific research units to carry out joint operations in order to solve problems. If the relevant scientific research units do not collaborate well in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, it will be difficult to ensure the realization of these key research project tasks, which will directly affect the speed of development of local production and construction undertakings.
    However, in the science and technology community, not everyone clearly sees this obvious truth. Some people worry that concentrating forces on key project research will affect the comprehensive leap forward of science and technology work. Others say that concentrating forces on studying the key issues in current production and construction is only concerned with the present and abandoning the long term, which has an impact on the development of science and technology, and so on. The existence of these thoughts hinders the development of collaboration.
    Although the above statements and ideas are different, the essence of the problem is the same. They still have insufficient understanding of the policy of science and technology serving production and the integration of scientific and technological research work with practice, and they are not implementing it firmly. Under the current circumstances of limited scientific and technological forces, the many projects proposed by various regions, even if they are all needed for production and construction, cannot all advance simultaneously. We must distinguish between priorities and urgencies, first grasp the key projects, and then arrange for the research of general projects, concentrating the main forces to first complete the key research projects. In order to ensure the realization of key project research tasks, it is inevitable to weaken the research strength of some general projects. Even some projects that are not urgently needed for research should be delayed. In this way, science and technology work can make a greater contribution to production and construction. The experience of many places last year proved that as long as collaboration is done well, key research projects are grasped, and the research work of non-key projects is rationally arranged, it is possible to both complete the key project tasks well and complete the general project tasks well. At the same time, it meets the current production requirements and accelerates the development of science and technology, opening up avenues for further development of production. For example, Zhejiang Province has done a good job in this year's collaboration, grasping the key projects around the realization of the four major indicators of industrial and agricultural production, and also paying attention to research in various aspects such as medicine and science that can pave the way for production and are closely related to production, and has already made significant achievements. On the contrary, in places where collaboration has not been done well or there is no collaboration, not only the key research projects cannot be well guaranteed because the forces are weak or have not played a role, but also the non-key projects proposed by various units and individuals, although their subjective wishes are very good and they are working hard, and the plan also proposes the time, quality, and measures to complete the task, but due to the lack of collaborative conditions from relevant units, they cannot be well realized.
    More than four months have passed this year. Is the collaboration of scientific and technological workers in various regions well organized? Are the leap forward indicators proposed by everyone this year truly implemented on a reliable basis? This is a problem that deserves attention and must be solved.

　　协作与落实
　　樊柯
    今年以来，随着各级党委加强对科学技术工作的领导，各地科学技术部门在“全国一盘棋”的精神下，除根据本地的能力、特长，担任部分全国重要的关键性任务以外，又根据当前本地生产建设的要求以及科学技术工作的基础，大力建立和发展地区性的科学技术工作，有重点而又照顾全面地安排今年的任务。可以看出，这种地区性的科学技术工作，在全国各地将获得迅速的发展，并且，它将成为今年整个科学技术工作继续大跃进的一大特色。现在，科学技术工作中的重要问题，就是要很好解决协作问题。组织协作，就能安排力量，调整项目，创造条件，使各项任务的指标落实在可靠的基础上，保证其实现，以促进地区科学技术工作顺利地发展。中共浙江省委在具体制定今年各项研究项目的过程中，发动各科学技术研究部门、高等院校以及有关各产业部门采取“六定”的办法全面协作，这样的做法就能有效地解决问题，值得各地参考。
    目前，在科学技术工作方面强调协作，比起去年有它新的意义。这首先是适应当前科学技术工作任务的要求。1958年科学技术工作的大跃进，科学技术的队伍虽然有了空前的壮大，并且得到了锻炼和提高，试验设备和仪器也有了大量的增加，但是，对当前繁重的任务来说，力量还显得不足。特别是一些带有系统性和综合性的重点研究项目，需要各有关科学研究单位通力合作，进行联合作业，才能解决问题。假如各有关科学研究单位，在人力、物力和财力方面不很好进行协作，就很难保证这些重点研究项目任务的实现，也将直接影响各地生产建设事业发展的速度。
    但是，在科学技术界，对于这个显而易见的道理，并不是人人都看得清楚的。有的人就耽心把力量集中起来搞重点项目的研究，会影响科学技术工作的全面跃进。也有的人说，集中力量研究当前生产建设中的关键性问题，是只顾了眼前，舍了长远，对科学技术的发展有影响，等等。这些思想的存在，妨碍着协作的开展。
    以上的一些说法和想法虽然不同，问题的实质则是相同的。他们对于科学技术为生产服务，科学技术研究工作结合实际的方针还认识不足，执行得不坚决。在当前科学技术力量有限的情况下，各地所提出来的许许多多项目，即使它们都是为生产建设所需要的，也不能项项齐头并进，必须分清轻重缓急，首先抓住重点项目，然后安排对一般项目的研究，集中主要力量首先完成重点研究项目。而为了保证重点项目研究任务的实现，也必然要削弱一些一般项目的研究力量，甚至，有些不是迫切需要研究的项目，还要缓一下。这样，才能使科学技术工作为生产建设作出更大的贡献。去年许多地方的经验证明，只要搞好协作，抓住重点研究项目，又合理安排了非重点项目的研究工作，就能既很好完成重点项目任务，又很好完成一般项目的任务，同时，既满足了当前生产的要求，又加速发展了科学技术，为进一步发展生产开辟了途径。如浙江省搞好了今年的协作，既抓住了围绕实现工农业生产四大指标的重点项目，也注意了能够为生产开路，以及与生产密切有关的医、理等各方面项目的研究，并且已经做出了明显成绩。相反的，凡是没很好进行协作或是不协作的地方，不但是重点研究项目因为力量单薄或是没有发挥作用，不能很好保证它实现，就是各单位、个人所提出的非重点项目，虽则他们的主观愿望很好，干的劲头也大，计划中也提出了完成任务的时间、质量以及措施，但是由于缺少有关单位协作的条件，也不能很好实现。
    今年已经过去四个多月了。各地科学技术工作者的协作是不是组织好了？大家所提出今年的跃进指标，是不是真正落实到可靠的基础上了？这是值得重视和必须求得解决的问题。
