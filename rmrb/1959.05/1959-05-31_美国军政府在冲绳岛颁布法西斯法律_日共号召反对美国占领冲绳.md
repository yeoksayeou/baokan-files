Xinhua News Agency Report: The fascist decrees recently formulated by the US military government occupying Okinawa to suppress the Okinawan people are being fiercely opposed by the people of Okinawa and throughout Japan.

The US military government occupying Okinawa promulgated a decree on criminal law and litigation procedures on the 18th, attempting to intensify the suppression of the Okinawan people's movement against US rule and demanding peace, democracy, and freedom. This decree will take effect on June 5th. The decree stipulates that those who "defame" the US government, the US military government of Okinawa, and the US-manipulated Ryukyu government through public speeches, publications, and broadcasts will be sentenced to imprisonment, a fine of $1,250, or both. According to this decree, the US military government can impose the death penalty on the Okinawan people for "sabotage" or "disturbing the peace" "for the benefit of foreign governments and foreigners." After this decree comes into effect, the Okinawan people's just struggles, such as demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan, will be suppressed. The Japanese people indignantly denounce these decrees as "death penalty laws."

Since its promulgation, this reactionary decree has been fiercely opposed by the people of Okinawa and all of Japan. On May 21st, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) sent a telegram to the US President and US High Commissioner to Okinawa, Booth, severely protesting the promulgation of the reactionary law and opposing the US military government's deprivation of the Okinawan people's freedom and rights to demand the return of Okinawa to Japan, etc., through the death penalty. On the same day, the Central Committee of the JCP issued a statement calling on all Japanese patriotic and democratic forces to launch a protest movement against this barbaric law. The statement pointed out that the reason the US is implementing such a barbaric law in Okinawa is that the US is attempting to openly drag Japan into a military alliance with the Soviet Union and China as its hypothetical enemies through the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and to strengthen its military control over Okinawa and the entire Japan.

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the afternoon of May 22nd, saying that the purpose of the new law is to suppress the democratic movement demanding the return of Okinawa's administrative rights to Japan, opposing the conversion of Okinawa into a base for atomic and hydrogen bombs, and defending the lives and rights of workers. The Socialist Party demanded that the US authorities immediately revoke this law.

The Japan Peace Committee issued a protest letter on the 22nd, demanding that the US authorities in Okinawa abolish this law and abolish all laws that violate the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Peace Committee also demanded that the United States return Okinawa's administrative rights to Japan.

On May 22nd, the Okinawa People's Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, expressing its determination to jointly fight against this reactionary decree.

A short commentary published by the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" on May 22nd pointed out that due to the implementation of this law, the Okinawan people's freedom of speech will be completely deprived.

    美国军政府在冲绳岛颁布法西斯法律
    日共号召反对美国占领冲绳
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：占领冲绳的美国军政府最近为镇压冲绳岛人民而制定的法西斯法令，正在遭到冲绳和日本全国人民的激烈反对。
    占领冲绳岛的美国军政府于18日颁布了一项关于刑法和诉讼手续法的法令，企图借以加紧镇压冲绳岛人民反对美国统治和要求和平、民主与自由的运动。这项法令将于6月5日起生效。这项法令规定，对于通过发表公开演讲、出版印刷物和广播等办法来“诽谤”美国政府、美国冲绳岛军政府和由美国操纵的琉球政府的人将处以徒刑、一千二百五十美元的罚款或双重的刑罚。根据这项法令，美国军政府可以在“为了外国政府和外国人的利益”进行“怠工”或者“妨碍治安”的罪名下，对冲绳人民处以死刑。这项法令生效后，冲绳人民要求把冲绳归还日本等正义斗争，都将遭到镇压。日本人民愤慨地把这些法令指责为“死刑法”。
    这一反动法令自从颁布后，立即遭到冲绳和日本全体人民的激烈反对。日共中央于5月21日打电报给美国总统和美国驻冲绳高级专员布斯，严重抗议反动法律的颁布，反对美国军政府以死刑来剥夺冲绳人民要求把冲绳岛归还日本等的一切自由和权利。同一天，日共中央发表声明，号召全体日本爱国民主力量展开抗议运动，反对这一野蛮的法律。声明指出，美国所以要在冲绳实行这种野蛮法律，是因为美国企图通过修改美日“安全条约”公开地把日本拉进以苏联和中国为假想敌国的军事同盟中去，并且要加强对冲绳及整个日本军事控制。
    日本社会党于5月22日下午发表声明说，新法律的目的是要镇压要求把冲绳岛的行政权归还日本、反对把冲绳变成原子弹和氢弹基地、维护工人的生活和权利的民主运动。社会党要求美国当局立即撤销这项法律。
    日本和平委员会22日发表一项抗议书，要求冲绳岛美国当局取消这项法律，并且废除违反联合国宪章和世界人权宣言的一切法律。和平委员会还要求美国把冲绳岛的行政权还给日本。
      5月22日冲绳人民党打电报给日本共产党中央委员会，表示了共同为反对这一反动法令而斗争的决心。
      5月22日日本资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”发表的短评指出，由于实行这项法律，冲绳岛人民的言论自由将被完全剥夺。
