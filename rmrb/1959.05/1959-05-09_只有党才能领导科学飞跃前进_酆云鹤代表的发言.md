　　I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I suggest that the congress approve them.

　　Premier Zhou's report is a report of the Great Leap Forward. It summarizes the great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan, poetically describes the unprecedented Great Leap Forward of 1958, and also hints at the beautiful picture of a further and greater leap forward in 1959. These magnificent facts and plans inspire everyone. Especially as an old intellectual engaged in scientific work, I deeply thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for formulating the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, which has pointed out a bright and magnificent path forward for us. We can bravely advance under the brilliant illumination of this general line, looking forward to the infinite beauty of the future on the basis of the existing great achievements. It really makes people feel how happy it is to be born in the Mao Zedong era!

　　Representatives from various leap forward fronts have introduced the leap forward in various aspects with practical and vivid examples and figures. Don't those skeptics still not believe it?!

　　These achievements show that: with politics in command, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Especially in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, facing production, combining theory with practice, and combining old experts with young people, China's scientific research also saw an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. The iron-like facts prove that only the Party can lead science to leap forward!

　　During the Great Leap Forward last year, I personally saw in the Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau that each factory changed its books every few days, and each book had a great leap forward. Under the leadership of the Party, the masses were mobilized, and everyone showed soaring enthusiasm, disregarding fatigue and rest. The strength of that force was unimaginable.

　　In October 1958, I started working with a group of young people and engineers in the newly established Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In the absence of chemical reagents, instruments, equipment, and laboratories, everyone went all out, unafraid of difficulties, and carried out our work under the Party's policy of "research must serve production." For example, when Western methods were not yet available, we first started with indigenous methods. After several months of effort, our fiber group extracted 0.5% to 0.8% pine needle oil, 10% pine needle resin, and more than 20% fiber from the abundant Masson pine needles in China using self-made barrel-type distillers. This set of indigenous equipment is simple and easy to operate, and can extract both oil and pine needle resin, which can be fully adopted in the communes. Preliminary tests have shown that refined pine needle oil can completely replace gasoline for driving cars, and can also be used to make perfumes and as a paint solvent. Pine needle resin can be used to make leather and pesticides. Its fiber can be used as raw material for high-grade paper. At a time when gasoline and paper are in short supply, it is of great significance to use pine needle oil as a substitute fuel and its fiber as raw material for papermaking. More than a dozen provinces in China are rich in Masson pine, and its needles have been discarded and unused for many years. Guangdong Province alone produces about 1.4 million tons of pine needles annually, which can produce about 140,000 tons of pine resin, 280,000 tons of pulp, and 2.4 million gallons of substitute gasoline. If calculated by using half of it, it can create 100 million yuan of wealth for the country in one year. Assuming it is promoted nationwide, its economic benefits will be even greater. The preliminary achievements made by the fiber group of our research institute are just a small example of the many achievements of the people mobilized by the Party's general line of building socialism.

　　During this period of the Great Leap Forward, under the correct leadership of the Party, Shandong Province has harvested more than 5 million jin of hemp stalks from wild tea trees (i.e., Apocynum venetum), and the manufacturing of hemp peeling machines has also made a preliminary foundation, preparing conditions for the future development and utilization of Apocynum venetum. In 1952, the Ministry of Textile Industry had already appraised Apocynum venetum and proved that it is a high-grade textile raw material. In 1954, Apocynum venetum was blended with fine wool, man-made wool, man-made cotton, silk, etc. to make a variety of textiles. Therefore, this wild plant has attracted the attention of all parties. The comprehensive utilization of Apocynum venetum, after various experimental studies (including the Lanzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), is summarized in the following five aspects: (1) Its roots can be used to make cardiac drugs; (2) Its leaves can be used as a substitute for tea; (3) Its stalks can be used to make high-grade pulp; (4) The waste liquid from degumming raw hemp can be used to extract tannin; (5) Its bark fiber can be spun. One plant has five uses, and its economic value is very high. Apocynum venetum is suitable for growing on saline-alkali land or desert land, so it can turn waste land into fertile fields. In order to increase the production of more textile raw materials and industrial raw materials, it is hoped that relevant departments and Shandong and Northwest regions will not only make full use of the existing wild Apocynum venetum, but also appropriately expand planting to utilize saline-alkali land or desert wasteland, and create more wealth for the country.

　　Ramie textile industry also had a great leap forward in 1958. In addition to Shanghai's increased production on the original basis, new ramie factories in Guangdong and Hunan have also started manufacturing various new products. These products have been welcomed at home and abroad, and provinces such as Sichuan and Anhui are also preparing to build such factories. China's traditional ramie textile industry for thousands of years has only been developed today under the leadership of the Party. The current problem is that the raw hemp is insufficient, so that the ramie products are far from meeting the needs of the people. In the past few years, the planting of ramie has increased somewhat, but it requires a lot of fertilizer and must be harvested in time. A slight delay in the harvesting time will affect the annual harvest. Sufficient attention must be paid to these two points in order to increase the yield per unit area of ramie. The need for ramie is increasing with the leap forward of various industries. For example, with the leap forward of steel, the amount of special ramie textiles required by steel plants has also increased; the agricultural Great Leap Forward also requires a large number of water hoses; and with the improvement of people's lives, more people wear leather shoes, and the demand for shoe sewing thread has also greatly increased. It is said that the demand for shoe sewing thread and water hoses in Shanghai alone is 400,000 jin, while Shanghai's current manufacturing capacity is only more than 100,000 jin, and with the shortage of raw materials, it can only produce 40,000 to 50,000 jin. Therefore, it will also affect the leap forward of other industries (such as water hose factories, leather shoe factories, etc.). In addition, the ever-developing transportation industry will greatly increase the demand for canvas, and the amount of fishing net line used in the fishery industry is also very large. In view of the various increasing needs for ramie, it is suggested that in addition to increasing the planting area for ramie production, attention should also be paid to and solved the problems of fertilization and timely harvesting, and the manufacturing of hemp peeling machines.

　　The 1959 national economic plan proposed on the basis of the 1958 leap forward, under the correct leadership of the Party, we have the confidence to resolutely complete it. As a scientific worker, I assure the Party that I will resolutely do my best to complete the scientific research tasks assigned to me by the superiors.

　　Now, I would like to say a few words about the Tibet issue: I fully support all the wise measures taken by the central government to quell the rebellion in Tibet! Just as the people of the whole country are in high spirits and continuing to leap forward, the reactionary group of the former Tibetan local government armed itself and betrayed the country, and after the failure of the rebellion, kidnapped the Dalai Lama and fled to India. Indian diplomatic officials distributed the so-called Dalai Lama's statement. This statement slanders and fabricates rumors, reverses black and white, and anyone can see that it was imposed on the Dalai Lama by others. Tibet is an indivisible part of China, it was so in the past, it is so now, and it will always be so in the future. The Tibetan people, like many other ethnic groups in China, will always be a member of the Chinese national family. The actions of imperialism and foreign reactionaries are completely interfering in China's internal affairs, which cannot be tolerated by the 650 million people of China. The awakened Tibetan people have long recognized who their enemies are. They urgently demand to get rid of the cruel exploitation of the serf system as soon as possible and move towards a prosperous, happy, and peaceful paradise on earth. China, this giant, has stood up. Wake up, schemers! We will always resolutely defend the motherland and safeguard world peace, and will not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, but we will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs.

　　只有党才能领导科学飞跃前进
    酆云鹤代表的发言
    我完全同意和衷心地拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并建议大会予以通过。
    周总理的报告是个大跃进的报告，总结了第一个五年计划的伟大成就，诗歌般地描述了一九五八年史无前例的大跃进，也提示出一九五九年进一步更大跃进的美丽的图景。这些宏伟的事实与规划，鼓舞了每一个人。尤其是像我这样作科学工作的旧知识分子，我深深地感谢共产党和毛主席制定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，给我们指出了光明壮阔的前进道路。我们能够在这个总路线的光辉照耀下奋勇前进，在已有的巨大成就的基础上，瞻望着未来的无限美景，确实令人感到生长在毛泽东时代是多么幸福！
    来自各个跃进战线上的代表们都用实际而生动的例子和数字介绍了各方面的跃进情况，那些怀疑论者还不相信吗？！
    这些成就说明了：政治挂了帅，没有不能克服的困难。特别是一九五八年的科学研究工作在党领导下，面向生产，理论与实践相结合，老专家同青年人相结合，我国科学研究也出现了史无前例的大跃进，铁一般的事实证明了只有党才能领导科学飞跃的前进！
    去年大跃进的时候，我在上海纺织工业局亲眼看到各厂每几天就换一本账，每本账都有很大的跃进。在党的领导下，群众发动起来了，每个人都拿出冲天的干劲，一个个不顾疲劳和休息，那种力量之大是令人估计不到的。
    一九五八年十月间，我在广州科学分院新筹建的应用化学所里开始同一批青年和工程师们一起工作。在缺乏化学药品、仪器设备及化验室等的情况下，大家鼓足了干劲，不怕困难，在党的“研究要为生产服务”的方针下，开展了我们的工作。例如我们在洋法还没有条件的时候，就先以土法上马。经过几个月的努力，我所纤维组从我国丰富的资源马尾松针中，用自制的套桶式蒸馏器，提出了百分之零点五到百分之零点八的松针油、百分之十的松针胶和百分之二十以上的纤维，这套土设备简单而易操作，既能提油又能提松针胶，完全可以在公社里采用。精制的松针油经初步试验完全可以代替汽油开车使用，也可用以制香精及做油漆溶剂。松针胶既能制皮革又能作农药。其纤维可以做高级纸的原料。在目前汽油和纸张不足的时候，利用松针油作为代用燃料和以其纤维供作造纸的原料，均有很大的意义。我国有十几省盛产马尾松，其针叶多年来废弃未用。仅广东一省松针年产量约有一百四十万吨，约可制十四万吨松胶、二十八万吨纸浆和二百四十万加仑代用汽油。若以利用一半计算，一年即可为国家创造一亿元的财富。假设推广全国，其经济收益将更不是一个小数。我们研究所纤维组作出这个初步成果，也不过是为党的建设社会主义的总路线所动员起来的人民的许许多多成就中的一个小小事例而已。
    在这一段大跃进的时间里，在党的正确领导下，山东省已经从野生的茶棵子（即罗布麻）上收割了五百多万斤麻杆，剥麻机的制造也有了初步基础，对于今后发展利用罗布麻准备了条件。一九五二年纺织工业部对于罗布麻已做了鉴定，证明它是高级的纺织原料。一九五四年又用罗布麻同细羊毛、人造毛、人造棉、绢丝等混纺制成了多样的纺织品。因此，这种野生植物引起了各方面的重视。对于罗布麻的综合利用，经各方面的试验研究（包括中国科学院兰州分院），归纳为以下五个方面：（1）它的根可以制强心药；（2）它的叶子可以代茶叶用；（3）它的杆可以做高级纸浆；（4）用生麻脱胶时的废液可以提取单宁；（5）它的皮纤维可以纺纱。一植五用，其经济价值是很大的。罗布麻适宜在盐碱地或沙漠地上生长，故可变废土为良田。为了增产更多的纺织原料和工业原料，希望有关部门及山东、西北各地除充分利用已有的野生罗布麻外，并适当地扩大种植，以利用盐碱地或沙漠荒地，为国家创造更多的财富。
    苎麻纺织工业在一九五八年亦有很大的跃进，除上海在原有基础上增产外，广东、湖南的新苎麻厂也已开工制造各种新产品，这些产品已受到国内外欢迎，正在筹建这类厂的还有四川、安徽等省。我国几千年来传统的苎麻纺织事业，也是只有今天在党的领导下，才获得了发展。目前存在的问题是原麻不足，以致苎麻制成品还远远赶不上人民的需要。几年来苎麻的种植是有所增加的，但是它需要的肥料多，要及时收割，在收割时间上稍有推迟，就会影响全年的收获量。对于这两点必须予以足够的注意，才能增加苎麻的单位面积产量。苎麻的需要是随着各项工业的跃进而增加的。如钢铁跃进，炼钢厂所需的特制苎麻纺织品的用量也就增加；农业大跃进，也就需要大量水龙带；又如人民生活提高，穿皮鞋的人多了，鞋缝线的需要量也就大为增加。仅上海一地，据说鞋缝线及水龙带的需要量就是四十万斤，而上海目前制造能力不过十几万斤，加以原料不足，现仅能生产四万到五万斤。因此，也会影响其他工业的跃进（如水龙带厂、皮鞋厂等）。此外，日益发展的交通运输业对帆布的需要量也将大为增加，水产业中鱼网线的用量也是很大。鉴于对苎麻的各种不断增长的需要，建议对于苎麻的增产，除增加种植面积外，对于施肥和及时收割、剥麻机制造等问题，也应予以重视和解决。
    在一九五八年跃进基础上所提出的一九五九年国民经济计划，在党的正确领导下，我们有信心来坚决完成它。我以一个科学工作者向党保证，我坚决尽最大的努力完成上级交给我的科学研究任务。
    现在，我想就西藏问题讲几句话：我完全拥护中央政府平息西藏叛乱的各项英明措施！正当全国人民都在意气奋发，继续跃进的时候，原西藏地方政府反动集团武装叛国，并在叛变失败后劫持达赖喇嘛逃往印度。印度外交官员散发了所谓达赖喇嘛的声明。这个声明污蔑造谣，颠倒黑白，任何人都看得出是别人强加于达赖喇嘛的。西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，过去如此，现在如此，将来永远如此，藏族同中国的许多其他民族一样，永远是中国民族大家庭的一个成员，帝国主义与外国反动派的行为完全是干涉中国内政，这是中国六亿五千万人民所不能容忍的。已经觉悟的藏族人民早已认清谁是他们的敌人，他们迫切要求早日摆脱残酷压榨的农奴制度，而走向繁荣幸福和平的人间乐园。中国这个巨人已经站起来了，野心家们清醒点吧！我们永远是坚决保卫祖国维护世界和平，不干涉任何国家的内政，但也决不容许别人干涉我国内政。
