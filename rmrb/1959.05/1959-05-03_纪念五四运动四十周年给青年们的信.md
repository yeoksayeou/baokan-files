Dear young friends and comrades:

    The 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement is here. On this anniversary of great revolutionary historical significance, on this glorious festival for Chinese youth, I extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the youth in all positions across the country.

    Forty years is a very short historical period. However, during this period, what earth-shaking and exciting changes have taken place in our motherland! I personally participated in the May Fourth Movement, and today, forty years later, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, I cannot express my excitement and happiness in words. At this moment, I naturally think of you first. Therefore, I am writing this letter to talk to you.

    Forty years ago, our country suffered from imperialist aggression from abroad and the scourge of warlords' constant infighting at home. The feudal comprador reactionary government sold out the country for glory, oppressing and enslaving the people. The vast numbers of workers, peasants, and youth lived in the dark abyss of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, often suffering from unemployment, lack of education, poverty, hunger, disease, and death. Women were in a particularly tragic situation. They were not only in an unequal position in all aspects, but were often treated as commodities for buying and selling. All of these situations at that time are difficult for your generation of young people to imagine.

    The serious national crisis and the unbearable suffering aroused the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle. The victory of the Great October Revolution further encouraged this struggle. In 1919, the imperialist countries that had won the First World War, such as the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, held a so-called "peace conference" in Paris to divide the spoils. This conference not only rejected the legitimate demands of the Chinese people to abolish the Twenty-One Demands, but also openly decided that Japan should inherit all of Germany's special privileges in Shandong. The Beijing warlord government, which had always humiliated the country and forfeited its sovereignty, was even preparing to compromise and sign the treaty. This aroused the unparalleled anger of the people across the country, especially the young students. The May Fourth Movement, which shook the whole country, broke out vigorously.

    The students in Beijing first raised the torch of striving for national independence and democratic freedom, and students in major and medium-sized cities and more than 20 provinces across the country responded one after another. Although the昏庸横暴 reactionary government used various cruel and criminal means to suppress it, the more severe the oppression, the greater the resistance. The patriotic youth at that time closely linked their personal destiny with the destiny of the country and the nation. In order to save the country, they ran around calling for action, forgetting to eat and sleep, disregarding all sacrifices, and unyieldingly persisted in carrying out heroic struggles. Personal life and death issues, gains and losses issues, and even family, marriage, and love, etc., were all put aside, and the patriotic enthusiasm of being selfless and forgetting the family for the sake of the country was developed. They continued their efforts and continued to struggle. When the movement developed to "June 3rd," the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie also joined the ranks of the struggle. First, the Shanghai workers announced a strike, followed by merchants closing their shops, quickly setting off an unprecedented anti-imperialist and anti-feudal patriotic democratic movement across the country.

    The May Fourth Movement has great revolutionary historical significance. Just as Chairman Mao Zedong said in his article "The May Fourth Movement," this movement "shows that China's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal bourgeois democratic revolution has developed to a new stage." However, due to the development of social forces at that time, especially because there was no leadership from a working-class party, the May Fourth Movement was not able to free China from the rule of imperialism and feudalism. The establishment of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 erected a guiding light on the road of the Chinese revolution. For more than thirty years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have gone through arduous and tortuous struggles, and on the land of the motherland, which has been sprinkled with the blood and sweat of revolutionaries, they have reaped the great fruits of victory, completed the task of the New Democratic Revolution, and achieved brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    From the very beginning of our Party's establishment, it has taken the leadership of the youth revolution and the women's liberation movement as its own responsibility. Chinese youth and women, united around the Party, correctly played their role and made great contributions to the Chinese revolution and socialist construction. With the continuous victory of the Chinese revolution and the development of construction, the ideals of national independence, democratic freedom, gender equality, and women's liberation, which the youth of the May Fourth era yearned for and strived for, have long been realized. Now, we are fighting heroically to build a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    The victorious development of the Chinese people's revolution over the past forty years has eloquently proved that the leadership of the Party and the leadership of Chairman Mao are the guarantee for us to achieve such great victories today, and also the guarantee for us to achieve even greater victories in the future. Therefore, I earnestly hope that you, this generation of young people, will always listen to the Party, always follow the Party, and go wherever the Party points. I also hope that you will study Marxism-Leninism hard, study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's various policies and instructions hard, and constantly improve your ideological awareness and theoretical level. At the same time, I also hope that you will continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle. Persistently engage in labor, especially intellectual youth, to continue to actively and consciously adhere to the promotion of labor training, establish the thoughts and feelings of the working people through eating, living, and working with the working people, and thoroughly transform their own positions and viewpoints. In 1939, Chairman Mao said at the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement in Yan'an: "To see whether a young person is revolutionary or not... there is only one standard, that is, to see whether he is willing to, and does, unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing to and do unite with the workers and peasants are revolutionary, otherwise they are not revolutionary, or are counter-revolutionary." Every young person should often use this standard put forward by Chairman Mao to measure himself. Some people say verbally that they listen to the Party, follow the Party, and recognize the Party's leadership, but in their thoughts and actions, they still adhere to the bourgeois individualistic standpoint. Such people will ultimately fall into the quagmire of anti-Party and anti-socialist without exception. Isn't this worthy of everyone's deep thought and vigilance?

    I hope that the youth of this era have such a lofty aspiration: under the leadership of the Party, set lofty goals, strive for advancement, and persistently, through efforts in both labor and reading, closely integrate labor and reading, attach importance to both labor and serious reading, and rely closely on the strength of the collective, gradually making oneself able to engage in both mental and physical labor, becoming a new communist who serves the people wholeheartedly, and striving to realize the great communist cause. Today's era is far greater than the May Fourth era, and the tasks you shoulder are far more arduous than those at that time. Therefore, you must not only have ideals and ambitions like the youth of the May Fourth era, but also stand higher, see farther, and surpass them in all aspects. The later generation inherits the previous generation, and surpasses the previous generation, becoming stronger generation after generation. The revolutionary cause is constantly developing forward. No matter when, you must not be content with the status quo, but strive for progress, resolutely shoulder the great task of rapidly building a strong socialist country, and make yourselves reliable successors to the communist cause.

    Of course, the ideals and ambitions that young people should have can only be communist ideals and ambitions, and there should never be any individualistic "ideals" and "ambitions." Bourgeois individualism is the source of all evils. The greater the individualistic "ideals" and "ambitions," the greater the danger, and even the destruction of oneself. Therefore, I hope that you will always be vigilant against it, and consciously strengthen ideological transformation, thoroughly breaking bourgeois ideology and resolutely establishing proletarian ideology.

    Communist ideals and ambitions must be implemented step by step in a down-to-earth manner. This requires you to advance bravely on the road of being both red and expert, as the Party often teaches, and strive to be both thoroughly red and deeply expert. Where do thorough redness and deep expertise come from? Only by persistently carrying out ideological transformation and labor training under the leadership of the Party, and by studying diligently, can we gradually achieve it. Learning scientific knowledge and mastering new culture was the ardent hope of the youth of the May Fourth era. Although the conditions at that time were very difficult, they still held high the banner of cultural revolution, powerfully impacting the ideology and culture of imperialism and feudalism, and setting off a new democratic cultural movement. Today's situation is completely different. The Party and the state have not only created superior conditions for you to learn science and culture, but also opened up vast "arenas" for you. Your wisdom and talents can be more fully developed. Our socialist construction has entered a new historical period centered on the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. The task of cultural revolution that you face is even more magnificent and arduous, and cannot be compared with the new cultural revolution movement of the May Fourth era. Whether from the aspect of need or from the aspect of possibility, you should raise the banner of cultural revolution even higher, and strive to climb the highest peak of scientific knowledge. The great socialist construction cause of the motherland requires you to always stand at the forefront of technological innovation and technological revolution, overcome numerous difficulties, combine hard work with skillful work, and combine soaring enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. On the basis of diligent study, further improve and carry forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to charge for the truth. It requires you to be not complacent or arrogant when you achieve success, and to strive for perfection and be even more skillful; when you encounter difficulties, do not be discouraged or inferior, and be warriors who overcome difficulties; always be humble and cautious, and constantly move forward.

    Dear young friends and comrades: The Party and the state have very high expectations for you: You are our hope and the future of the motherland. Whether you produce, work, and study well or not is not only related to the current socialist construction cause of the motherland, but also related to your own future happiness and the happiness of future generations. In the past, especially in last year's Great Leap Forward, you proved with outstanding achievements that you are worthy of being shock troops in socialist construction.

    I heartily wish you continued new achievements in labor, reading, ideological transformation, and physical exercise. Commemorate the 40th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement with greater and better achievements, and greet our glorious and brilliant 10th National Day with practical actions to realize the magnificent national construction plan of continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959.

    纪念五四运动四十周年给青年们的信
    邓颖超亲爱的青年朋友们、同志们：
    五四运动的四十周年纪念日到来了。在这个具有重大革命历史意义的纪念日，在中国青年的这个光荣的节日，我向全国各个岗位上的青年们表示衷心的、热烈的祝贺。
    四十年是一个很短的历史时期。但是，在这个期间，我们的祖国出现了多么惊天动地、多么令人兴奋鼓舞的变化；我曾经亲身参加过五四运动，四十年后的今天，回顾过去，瞻望将来，我无法用语言文字来表达我的激动的心情和幸福的感觉。在这个时刻，我很自然地首先想到你们。因此，我写这封信同你们谈谈。
    四十年前，我们的国家，外受帝国主义的侵略，内遭军阀连年混战的祸害，封建买办的反动政府卖国求荣，压迫和奴役人民。广大的工人农民和青年，生活在半殖民地、半封建社会的黑暗深渊，经常受着失业、失学、贫穷饥饿、疾病死亡的侵袭。妇女的处境特别悲惨，她们不仅在各方面处于不平等的地位，甚至常常被当作商品买卖。当时的这一切情况，是你们这一代青年难以想像的。
    严重的民族危机，无法忍受的苦难生活，激起了中国人民反帝反封建的革命斗争，伟大十月革命的胜利更鼓舞了这一斗争。一九一九年，美、英、法、日等在第一次世界大战中得胜的帝国主义国家，为了分赃，在巴黎举行所谓“和平会议”。这个会议不仅否决了中国人民提出的废除二十一条的正当要求，而且公然决定由日本继承德国在山东的一切特权，一贯丧权辱国的北京军阀政府竟准备妥协签字。这引起了全国人民、首先是青年学生的无比愤怒，震动全国的五四运动轰轰烈烈地爆发了起来。
    北京的学生首先举起争取民族独立、争取民主自由的火炬，全国各大、中城市和二十几个省区的学生纷起响应。虽然昏庸横暴的反动政府，用各种残酷罪恶的手段进行镇压，但是压迫得越狠，反抗性也越大。那时的爱国青年，把个人的命运和国家、民族的命运紧紧地联系在一起。为了救国，他们奔走呼号，废寝忘食，不顾一切牺牲，不屈不挠地坚持进行英勇的斗争，个人的生死问题，得失问题，以至家庭、婚姻恋爱等等，都置之度外，发扬了公而忘私、国而忘家的爱国热情，再接再厉，继续斗争。运动发展到“六三”的时候，无产阶级、小资产阶级和资产阶级也参加了斗争的行列。首先是上海工人宣布罢工，接着商人罢市，在全国范围内很快地就掀起了一个规模空前的反帝反封建的爱国民主运动。
    五四运动具有伟大的革命历史意义。正像毛泽东主席在“五四运动”一文中所说的那样，这个运动“表现中国反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命已经发展到了一个新阶段”。但是，由于当时社会力量的发展情况，特别是由于还没有工人阶级政党的领导，因此，五四运动并没有能够使中国摆脱帝国主义和封建主义的统治。1921年中国共产党的成立，在中国革命的道路上，竖起了指路的明灯。三十多年来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，经过了艰苦、曲折的斗争，在洒遍了革命者的血和汗的祖国大地上，结出了伟大胜利的果实，完成了新民主主义革命的任务，并且在社会主义革命方面和社会主义建设方面，获得了辉煌的成就。
    从我们党成立的一开始，就把领导青年革命和妇女解放运动引为自己的责任。中国青年和妇女，团结在党的周围，正确地发挥了他们的作用，对中国革命和社会主义建设作出了巨大的贡献。随着中国革命的不断胜利和建设的发展，使五四时代的青年所向往并为之奋斗的民族独立、民主自由、男女平等、妇女解放等理想，早已经实现了。现在，我们正为着建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大社会主义国家而英勇奋斗。
    四十年来，中国人民革命胜利地发展，雄辩地证明了：党的领导、毛主席的领导，是我们能够获得今天这样伟大胜利的保证，也是我们今后获得更伟大的胜利的保证。因此，我热切地希望你们这一代的青年，永远听党的话，永远跟着党走，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里。我还希望你们努力学习马克思列宁主义，努力学习毛主席的著作和党的各项政策、指示，不断提高思想觉悟和理论水平。同时，我也希望你们继续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神。顽强地进行劳动，特别是知识青年要继续积极地、自觉地坚持推行劳动锻炼，通过同劳动人民同吃同住同劳动，树立劳动人民的思想感情，彻底改造自己的立场和观点。1939年，毛主席在延安庆祝五四运动二十周年的纪念会上说过：“看一个青年是不是革命的，……只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”每一个青年都应当经常拿毛主席提出的这个标准来衡量自己。有些人在口头上说听党的话、跟着党走、承认党的领导，而在思想上、行动上照旧坚持资产阶级个人主义的立场，这种人最后会毫无例外地掉到反党反社会主义的泥坑里去。这难道不值得大家深思警惕吗？
    我希望，这个时代的青年都有这样一个崇高的志向：在党的领导下，立大志，争上游，坚持不懈地通过在劳动和读书两方面的努力，把劳动和读书紧密地结合起来，既重视劳动，又认真读书，两不偏废，紧紧地依靠集体的力量，逐步使自己既能从事脑力劳动，又能从事体力劳动，成为一个全心全意为人民服务的共产主义新人，为实现伟大的共产主义事业努力奋斗。今天的时代远比五四时代更伟大，你们肩负的任务也远比那个时候更艰巨，因此，你们不仅要像五四时代的青年那样，有理想，有抱负，而且要比他们站得更高，看得更远，在各个方面都远远地超过他们。后一代人继承前一代人，又超过前一代人，一代比一代更强。革命事业是永远不断向前发展的。无论什么时候，你们都不要安于现状，要力求进取，坚决地担负起迅速建成社会主义强国的伟大任务，并使自己成为可靠的共产主义接班人。
    当然，青年们所应当有的理想和抱负，只能是共产主义的理想和抱负，决不应有什么个人主义的“理想”和“抱负”。资产阶级个人主义是万恶之源，个人主义的“理想”和“抱负”越大，危险也越大，甚至会毁灭自己。因此，希望你们随时随刻都要对它提高警惕，并且要自觉地加强思想改造，彻底破资产阶级思想，坚决立无产阶级思想。
    共产主义的理想和抱负是要脚踏实地一点一滴去付诸实现的。这就要求你们像党所经常教导的那样。在又红又专的道路上奋勇前进，努力做到红透专深。红透和专深从哪里来？只有在党的领导下，坚持不懈地进行思想改造、劳动锻炼，刻苦钻研，才能逐步达到。学习科学知识，掌握新文化，本是五四时代青年的热望，尽管当时的条件十分困难，他们还是高举文化革命的大旗，有力地冲击了帝国主义和封建主义的思想、文化，掀起了新民主主义的文化运动。今天的情况已经完全不同了。党和国家不但为你们创造了学习科学和文化的优越条件，而且为你们开辟了广阔的“用武之地”。你们的智慧才能，能够得到更充分的发展了。我们的社会主义建设，已经进入了以技术革命和文化革命为中心的新的历史时期。你们所面临的文化革命的任务更加宏伟艰巨，是五四时代的新文化革命运动所不能比拟的。无论从需要方面来讲，或者从可能方面来讲，你们都应当把文化革命的旗帜更高地举起，努力攀登科学知识的最高峰。祖国的伟大社会主义建设事业，要求你们始终站在技术革新和技术革命的最前列，克服重重困难，把苦干和巧干结合起来，把冲天干劲和实事求是的精神结合起来，在刻苦钻研的基础上，进一步提高和发扬敢想、敢说、敢做、敢于为真理冲锋陷阵的共产主义风格。要求你们在得到成就的时候，不自满，不骄傲，精益求精，巧上加巧；在遇到困难的时候，不灰心，不自卑，要做战胜困难的勇士；永远谦虚谨慎，不断前进。
    亲爱的青年朋友们、同志们：党和国家对你们的期望是非常殷切的：你们是我们的希望，是祖国的未来。你们生产、工作、学习得好或不好，不仅关系到祖国当前的社会主义建设事业，而且关系到你们自己的前途幸福，以及子孙万代的幸福。在过去，特别是在去年的大跃进中，你们用出色的成绩证明你们不愧为社会主义建设的突击手。
    我热忱地祝你们在劳动、读书、改造思想、锻炼身体等方面，都不断取得新的成就。用更大更好的成绩来纪念五四运动的四十周年，用实现1959年继续跃进的宏伟的国家建设计划的实际行动，来迎接我们光辉灿烂的国庆十周年。
