    Introduction to Several Types of Rapid Rice Harvesters
    Agricultural Tool Reform Office, Ministry of Agriculture
    The several types of rapid rice harvesters introduced here are based on modifications of the rapid rice harvester from Hengnan County, Hunan Province. Although these rapid rice harvesters have been proven to be relatively good through multiple tests, local areas should still improve them according to their local conditions before promoting them.
    
    Shandong Rice-Wheat Dual-Purpose Rapid Harvester
    Features:
    (1) Easy to operate; a full-time worker can harvest two to three mu of wheat per day.
    (2) Simple structure, uses few materials, and can be imitated by general iron and woodworking factories.
    (3) Can harvest wheat, rice, sweet potato vines, etc., and can be used in paddy fields, dry fields, plains, hills, and fields of all sizes, especially suitable for harvesting densely planted, high-yield wheat.
    
    Construction and Function of Each Part:
    The "人" (person) shaped and wave-shaped rapid harvesters have the same structure except for the blade shape. They are all composed of five parts: handle, knife holder, base, straw support frame, and blade (as shown in Figure 1).
    
    Handle: Made of ordinary wood. It is 1,500 mm long, with the upper two-thirds being round with a diameter of 35 mm, and the lower part being flat. The bottom end has a mortise that fits into the inclined mortise of the base. The operator holds it to perform the harvesting.
    
    Knife Holder: Made of better hardwood. At a distance of 70 to 80 mm from the front end, it is made into an upward sloping angle to prevent soil from accumulating during work.
    
    Base: Made of hardwood, 220 mm long, 95 mm wide at the front, 70 mm wide at the back, and 20 mm thick.
    
    Straw Support Frame: Consists of four wooden vertical supports, four horizontal supports, one horizontal beam, and four bamboo strips. The function of the straw support frame is to hold the wheat stalks to be harvested in the middle of the knife holder for cutting, and to gather the cut wheat neatly together so that it can be bundled when enough for a bundle.
    
    Blade (as shown in Figure 2): Each harvester is equipped with two blades, made of steel plate or clad steel, with the cutting edge quenched and fine teeth inclined forward at 25 to 30 degrees.
    
    Jiangxi Boyang Rapid Harvester
    Construction and Specifications:
    The main materials are fir wood, zhamu wood, thatch bamboo, and iron blades. It consists of three parts: a wooden handle, a straw-holding frame, and a blade. The wooden handle is installed on the straw-holding frame through a support rod, and the bottom is connected to the blade. The top forms a trapezoidal frame that is low in the front and high in the back. The two small wooden strips at the bottom are boat-shaped. The blade is made of steel. There is a one-millimeter gap in the middle where the blades meet, and a small square hole at the end where they meet so that residual weeds can leak down through the hole to prevent the blade from becoming blocked and affecting harvesting.
    
    Operating Method:
    Hold the handle with both hands and push forward. When the straw-holding frame is full, tilt it to the right and lay it down. Then use your foot to slightly stir the stalks.
    
    Uses and Efficiency:
    Mainly used for harvesting rice, but can also be used for wheat. Each person can harvest five to six mu per day, increasing efficiency by three to four times compared to the old-fashioned sickle.
    
    Advantages:
    Simple structure, low cost, with each unit costing only about three yuan. The handle forms a 40-degree angle with the ground, making it easy and labor-saving to operate. The end of the handle has a curved grip suitable for operation.
    
    Guangdong Kaiping Style Rice Harvester
    Features:
    (1) High efficiency, good cutting. One person can harvest six to seven mu per day, working ten hours.
    (2) Can harvest rice, wheat, and lodged crops.
    (3) Easy to operate, suitable for use by general laborers and women.
    (4) Simple structure, low cost, and easy to obtain materials and manufacture.
    
    Construction, Specifications, and Quality:
    Roughly divided into two parts: blade and wooden frame (see figure).
    
    (1) Blade: Divided into left and right blades, each 37 cm long and 5 cm wide. The cutting edge has fine-grained teeth and is arc-shaped. Generally made of wrought iron and carburized, it is better to use low carbon steel. A semi-circular notch is opened near the base of the right blade so that residual grass and waste can leak down through the notch during harvesting. The blade tip is tilted upwards to avoid inserting into the soil during use.
    
    (2) Wooden Frame: Consists of a base plate, wooden wheels, handle, and straw-pushing device. The base plate is used to install the blades; the wooden wheels mainly help reduce the friction of the base plate on the ground during harvesting; the handle is for the operator to hold; and the straw-pushing device is to prevent the cut crops from falling to both sides and to arrange them neatly on the ground.
    
    (3) Issues to be Noted in Manufacturing and Installation: (1) The two blades must be firmly fixed to the base plate with screws, without any movement or shaking; (2) The two blades must be level with each other during installation, without one being higher than the other; (3) At the cutting position of the blade edges, the two blades must not be completely aligned, and a gap of 1 to 1.5 mm must be left. At the same time, the length of the cutting position is best at 3 to 5 cm, not too short, to avoid a portion of the crop not being cut; (4) The handle should not be installed too straight. Generally, the inclination angle should be 33 degrees to the horizontal plane.
    
    Hunan Chicken Coop Style Rapid Rice Harvester
    Features:
    1. Cuts quickly and is highly efficient. Working ten hours a day, each person can generally harvest four to six mu, increasing efficiency by more than five times compared to the old-fashioned sickle.
    2. Suitable for use in paddy, dry, and lodged fields.
    3. Easy to master and use.
    4. Easy to operate, even women and semi-able-bodied workers can use it.
    5. Cuts neatly and cleanly.
    6. Simple structure and low cost. Manufacturing a harvester requires only a small amount of iron, wood, and bamboo materials.
    
    Construction:
    Consists of a wooden handle, a straw-holding frame, and a sickle. The wooden handle is installed on the straw-holding frame through a support rod, and the bottom is connected to the sickle; the straw-holding frame is made of bamboo strips and small wooden strips, forming a trapezoidal frame that is low in the front and high in the back. The two small wooden strips at the bottom are boat-shaped, with the tips slightly upward, and the bottom should be higher than the sickle.
    
    The straw-holding frame has three functions: first, to separate the crops; second, to support lodged crops; and third, to enclose the stalks. The sickle consists of two blades, with fine-grained teeth on the cutting edge. A one-millimeter gap must be left in the middle where the two blades meet, and a small square hole is left at the end to facilitate the passage of weeds through the gap, which can avoid blocking the blade and affecting the speed. Three holes are drilled in the tail of each blade, and iron nails are passed through the holes to nail the blades to the bottom of the wooden handle. The tips of the blades are fixed inside the boat-shaped wooden strips on both sides to prevent the sickle from shaking (see figure for details).
    
    The straw-holding frame and handle of the rice harvester must be adapted to the size of the blade. Therefore, attention should be paid to the following during installation: (1) The joints of each component must be firm and reliable; (2) It is best to use screws when installing the blade; (3) The two blades must be fixed on the same horizontal line.

    介绍几种快速割禾器
    农业部工具改革办公室
    这里介绍的几种快速割禾器，是以湖南衡南县快速割禾器为基础改造而成的。尽管这几种快速割禾器是经过多次试验证明比较优良的，各地选用时仍需根据本地的情况加以改进，然后再推广。
    山东稻麦两用快速收割器
    特点：
    （1）操作轻便，一个整劳力一天可收割小麦二至三亩。
    （2）构造简单，用料少，一般铁木工厂都能仿制。
    （3）可以收割小麦、水稻、地瓜秧等，不论水田、旱田、平原、丘陵、大小地块都可使用，特别适用于收割密植高产的小麦。各部构造和作用：
    “人”字型和波浪型两种快速收割器的构造，除刀片形式不同外，其他各部结构完全一样。都是由手把、刀架、底座、扶禾架、刀片等五部分组成的（如图1）。
    手把：用一般木料制成。长一千五百公厘，上端三分之二是圆的，直径三十五公厘，下部是扁方的，底端有斜榫，嵌在底座斜卯里，操作手就掌握它，进行收割。
    刀架：用较好的硬木制成。距前端七十到八十公厘处，制成向上倾斜的斜角，以防止工作时拥土。
    底座：用长二百二十公厘、前宽九十五公厘、后宽七十公厘、厚二十公厘的硬木制成。
    扶禾架：由木制的四根竖撑、四根横撑、一根横梁和四根竹片构成。扶禾架的作用是把要收割的小麦蔸揽在刀架中间进行切割，并将切割后的小麦整齐的集拢在一起，以便够打一捆时，倒出来打捆。
    刀片（如图2）：每一部收割器上装有两片，用钢板或夹钢锻成，刃口并经淬火处理，上面并开有向前斜二十五至三十度的细齿。
    江西波阳快速收割器
    构造和规格：
    主要材料以杉木、扎木、茅竹、铁制刀片为主。是由木手柄、装禾架、刀片等三个部分组成的，木手柄通过一根支杆安装在禾架上，底部与刀片相接，上面形成一个前低后高梯形架子，底部两根小木条船形底，刀片掺钢，刀片相合的中部留有一公厘空隙，尾部相合处有一小方孔，以便残杂草由小孔漏下，以免刀片阻塞影响收割。操作方法：
    用二只手握住柄把向前推动，装满禾架向右边立顺倒下，再用脚稍拨搅禾蔸。用途与效率：
    主要收割水稻，也可以割麦类。每人每天能收割五至六亩，比旧式镰刀割禾提高工效三至四倍。优点：
    构造简单，成本低，每部只需成本三元左右，把柄与地面成四十度角，操作方便省力，柄末端有弯把适于操作。
    东广开平式割禾器
    特点：
    （1）效率高，割得好。一人操作每日以十小时工作计算，可以收割六至七亩。
    （2）可以收割水稻、小麦、倒伏禾。
    （3）操作容易，一般劳动力和妇女均能操作使用。
    （4）构造简单，成本低廉，取材和制造都很容易。构造规格和质量：
    大体上分成刀片和木架两个部分（见图）。
    （1）刀片：分为左右两把刀片，长各为三十七公分、阔为五公分。刃部开有细纹刀牙，呈弧形。一般用锻铁并经过渗炭处理制成，用低炭钢制成更好。在右刀片接近基部处开一个半圆形缺口，以便收割时，残草废物通过缺口漏下，刀尖向上翘起，可避免使用时插入土中。
    （2）木架：是由底板、木轮、手柄和搒禾器四部分组成。底板是用来安装刀片的；木轮主要是帮助减少底板在收割时对地面的摩擦力；手柄是操作时把手用的；搒禾器是为了使割断的禾不致向两边倒，而齐整地摆在地下。
    （3）在制造和安装上应注意的问题：（一）两把刀片要牢牢地用螺丝固定在底板上，不能有一点移动和晃动；（二）两把刀片在安装时一定要互相平整，不能一高一低；（三）在两刀片刃部切断位置，不能完全吻合，必须留有一至一点五公厘的缝。同时切断位置长度最好在三至五公分，不可过短，这样可以避免有一部分禾割不断；（四）手柄不能安装太直，一般斜度以与水平面成三十三度角为宜。
    湖南鸡笼式快速割禾器
    特点：
    1、割得快、工效高。每天以十小时工作计算，每人一般可收割四至六亩，比旧式镰刀提高工效五倍以上。
    2、适合水、旱、倒伏禾三种田使用。
    3、容易掌握使用。
    4、操作轻松，妇女半劳力都能使用。
  　5、割得整齐干净。
    6、结构简单，成本低。制造一部收割器，只需少量铁、木、竹材料。构造：
  　由木手柄、装禾架、镰刀三部分构成。木手柄通过一根支条安装在装禾架上，底部与镰刀相接；装禾架是由竹片与小木条制成，上面形成一个前低后高的梯形架子，底部的两根小木条成船底形，尖端稍向上翘，底部要高出镰刀。
    装禾架的作用有三：一是将禾分开，二是扶起倒伏禾，三是围装禾秆。镰刀是由两块刀片组成，刀口部分有细纹刀牙，两块刀片相合的中间，必须留出一公厘的缝，尾部留一小方孔，便于杂草经过隙孔漏下，能避免刀口堵塞而影响速度。刀片尾部各钻有三个孔，铁钉从孔中穿过钉在木手柄的底部，刀片尖端固定在两边的船形木条内，以免镰刀晃动。（详见图）
    割禾器的装禾架和手柄，一定要与刀片的大小相适应，因此在安装时需要注意：（1）各部件相接处要坚实牢靠。（2）安装刀片时最好采用螺丝钉。（3）两块刀片要固定在一个水平线上。（附图片）
