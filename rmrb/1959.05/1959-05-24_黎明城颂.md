    Ode to Dawn City
    Bai Nationality Zhang Chang
    The <i>Ju</i> Tree

    On the banks of the Lancang River, on the edge of Dawn City, grow <i>ju</i> trees, one after another. I think nothing else can represent the character of Dawn City like it.

    Its lushness reminds me of the vigorous development and great construction of this border town.

    Its uprightness and handsomeness make me think of the border builders full of energy...

    Here, we only call the most upright young man "Little <i>Ju</i> Tree"; and the most beautiful poems are recorded on <i>ju</i> leaves—like the ancient "Zhaoshutun" (a famous Dai narrative poem).

    How many <i>ju</i> trees grow on both sides of the Lancang River? I don't know. How many leaves does each <i>ju</i> tree have? I don't know even more.

    But I know that among the people I know, there are many young men as upright as the little <i>ju</i> tree; and in the great leap forward of socialism, there are also many poems that can rival "Zhaoshutun."

    Often, when I see groups of young people from the Dai, Hani, and Lahu ethnic groups boarding cars to go to Beijing for the National Day celebrations; or when I see boats of steel and cement crossing the Lancang River and heading towards Yunjinghong, I stare blankly at the tall <i>ju</i> trees in a daze: can picking all the <i>ju</i> leaves in the twelve <i>banna</i> (the Dai word "Xishuang" is translated as "twelve") record such a great epic—"The Glorious Decade of the Twelve <i>Banna</i>"?

    Roads

    This is a winding post road. It comes down from the distant hillside, crosses the dam, and then lonely drills into the dark old forest in the distance. Whenever it is a misty morning or a hazy moonlit night, in the dam, on the winding post road, the bells of the ancient caravans always ring: ding-ling, ding-ling, ding-ling, slowly dissolving into the milky night mist or the silvery moonlight. This winding post road, ah, has it passed through which places, experienced how many eras, how many horses and how many people have walked on it, who knows! Only the originally flat road surface has now been trampled into deep and narrow grooves.

    This is a flat, wide highway, it also passes through our dam, like a bolt of homespun cloth woven by Ama, rolling down from the hillside opposite, all the way to Yunjinghong. Day and night, cars come and go like ants hurrying on the trunk of a large banyan tree... Five years, how many cars and how many people have passed on this road, who knows! I only know that the first people's representative of the Dai family took a car to Beijing on this road. And when the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee was established, the first bundle of steel was also pulled from here.

    Now, between that winding post road and the wide highway, a third road will appear—a new, steel road. One end of it is our Dawn City, and the other end is tightly connected to Beijing.

    Look, still on that hillside opposite, a railway surveyor is waving a small red flag, and in front of him is a tall pole, like a coconut tree.

    Soon, under the hillside where the pole is erected, a long steel dragon spitting black smoke will drill out...

    Manfeitong Reservoir

    Legend has it that a ferocious dragon lives in this deep valley. In the past, in that dark age, it bared its fangs and claws and committed all kinds of evil.

    When it was dry, our ancestors prayed sincerely: "Dragon, give us a few drops of clear water!" But it instead scorched the rocks until they smoked.

    When there was too much rain, our ancestors prayed: "Dragon, take some back!" But it instead poured all the flash floods into our village.

    In that painful era, our ancestors could only cry and crawl away from it.

    Now, we listen to Chairman Mao's words, we have caught this ferocious dragon and locked it in our reservoir!

    When it rains, we say: "Dragon, quickly eat all the mountain water into your belly!" And it obediently drinks all the flash floods into its belly.

    When we plant double-cropping rice, we say: "Now, we need water, quickly spit it out, spit it out from one nostril!" So it obediently spits out the water, not daring to use both nostrils.

    Next, we will also use hydropower to generate electricity to light up the lights, and then our young men will ride on its back, grab its horns, and order it:

    "Turn this turbine! Dragon, quickly stretch out your claws!"

    The repaired Manfeitong Reservoir is a large mirror, from which you can see small fish gliding above the clouds and the yellow mangoes hanging on the trees, the red Romaine flowers, and the small deer running to drink water.

    You will also see the overhanging eaves of the palace-like sanatorium and the golden spire; you will also see a small milk-colored building, which is the commune's small hydropower station.

    Also, the "Peacock Princess" ① from Meng'ao Dongban will definitely fly to our large reservoir to bathe. Let her see the scenery of this reservoir!

    Of course—I guarantee—our young men will never steal other people's feather clothes like the absurd Zhaoshutun ②!

    ① Dai narrative poem: "Zhaoshutun" refers to the Peacock Princess Nanno Na.
    ② Refers to the prince in the same poem. It was he who stole the peacock princess's feather clothes when she was bathing.

    黎明城颂
    白族　张长
    椇树
    在澜沧江畔，在黎明城边，长着一棵一棵的椇树。我想，再没有什么东西能像它一样代表黎明城的性格了。
    它的葳蕤茂盛，使我想起这边城的蓬勃发展的大建设。
    它的挺拔俊秀，又叫我想起浑身是劲的边疆建设者……
    在我们这儿，最挺最挺的小伙子，我们才管他叫“小椇树”；最美最美的诗篇，才把它记录在椇叶上——譬如古老的“召树屯”（傣族著名的叙事长诗）。
    澜沧江两岸，到底长着多少棵椇树？我不知道。每一棵椇树又有多少叶子？我更不知道。
    可是我知道，在我认识的人当中，有好些好些和小椇树一样挺的小伙子；而在社会主义大跃进当中，能和“召树屯”媲美的诗篇也有的是。
    常常，当我看到一群群的傣族、哈尼族、拉祜族的年青人登上到北京观礼的汽车；或者，看见一船船的钢筋、水泥渡过澜沧江，向着允景洪开来的时候，我会呆呆地望着高高的椇树出神：摘尽十二版纳（傣语“西双”意译即“十二”）所有的椇叶，是否能记完这样一部伟大的史诗——“十二版纳光辉的十年”？
    道路
    这是一条弯弯曲曲的驿道。它从远处的山坡上下来，穿过坝子，又寂寞地钻进远处黝黑的老林。每当晓雾迷离的早晨，或是月色蒙胧的夜晚，在坝子里，在弯弯曲曲的驿道上，总会响起古老的马帮的铃铛：叮铃，叮铃，叮铃，慢慢地溶化在乳色的夜雾或银色的月色里。这弯弯曲曲的驿道呵，经过了哪些地方，经历了多少年代，在它上面走过了多少匹马，多少个人，谁知道呢！只见原是平平的路面，现在已踩成一道道又深又窄的槽槽了。
    这是一条平平的、宽宽的公路，它也通过我们的坝子，像阿妈织的一轴土布，从对面的山坡上一滚而下，一直到了允景洪。不论白天黑夜，一辆辆的汽车，像大榕树干上匆忙地来往着的蚂蚁……五年了，这条路上过去了多少辆汽车，多少个人，谁又知道呢！我只晓得傣家的第一个人民代表，就是从这条路上坐汽车到北京的。而自治州人委会建立时，第一束钢筋也是从这儿拉来的。
    现在，在那弯弯曲曲的驿道和宽宽的公路中间，又将出现第三条路——一条新的、钢铁的路。它的一头是我们的黎明城，另一头紧结着北京。
    看啊，还是在对面的那个山坡上，一个铁路测量队员正挥动着一面小红旗，他的前面是高高的，像椰子树一样的标杆。
    不久，就在那竖着标杆的山坡下面，将钻出一条吐着黑烟的钢铁的长龙……
    曼菲童水库
    传说，在这深深的谷底，住着一头凶恶的龙。在过去，那黑暗的年代里，它张牙舞爪，为非作恶。
    天旱时，我们的祖先虔诚祈祷：“龙啊，赐与我们几滴清水吧！”它倒反把岩石都晒得冒烟。
    雨水太多的时候，我们的祖先祈祷：“龙啊，你吸回去一些吧！”它倒反把所有的山洪倾入我们的寨子。
    在那痛苦的年代里，我们的祖先只有哭着、爬着让开它。
    现在，我们听毛主席的话，我们捉住了这条凶龙，把它关在我们的水库里啦！
    雨天，我们说：“龙，快把所有的山水吃到你的肚里！”它就乖乖地把所有的山洪喝到肚里。
    种双季稻了，我们说：“现在，我们需要水，快吐出来，从一个鼻孔里吐出来！”于是它就乖乖地把水吐出来，不敢从两个鼻孔里。
    接着，我们还要用水力发电点灯，那时，我们的小伙子会骑在它的背上，扳着它的角，命令它：
    “转动这涡轮机！龙，快伸出你的脚爪！”
    修好的曼菲童水库，是一面大的镜子，从里面可以看见小鱼在云彩上面滑翔以及挂在树上的黄黄的芒果，红红的萝卖亮花，和跑来喝水的小麂子。
    还会看到宫殿似的疗养院的飞檐和金色的塔尖；也会看到一小幢乳色的小楼，那是公社的小型水力发电站。
    还有，勐奥东版的“孔雀公主”①一定会飞到我们这大水库里来洗澡。让她看看这水库的风光！
    当然——我保证——我们的小伙子绝不会像荒唐的召树屯②又去把人家的羽衣偷走！
    ①傣族叙事长诗：“召树屯”中的孔雀公主喃诺娜。
    ②同诗中的王子。就是他在孔雀公主入浴时偷去了她的羽衣。
