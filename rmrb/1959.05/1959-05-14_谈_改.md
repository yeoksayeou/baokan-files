Talking About "Reform"
Liu Zijiu

This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China. Everyone is busy completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan targets for continued great leaps forward, and summarizing the work achievements and experiences of this great decade to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day. In the history of our country, this decade has indeed been great, and brilliant achievements have been made on all fronts, including politics, military affairs, economy, ideology, culture, and education. Regarding this great decade, I thought about it over and over again and came up with such a question, that is, in this great decade, the various tasks undertaken, the various movements carried out, and the various achievements and experiences obtained by the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao are almost all related to the word "reform". Such as "Land Reform," "Democratic Reform," "Socialist Transformation," "Ideological Remolding," "Labor Reform," "Teaching Reform," "Drama Reform," "Writing Reform," "Judicial Reform," "Wage System Reform," "Improvement of Soil," "Improvement of Varieties," "Single (Season) Double Change," "Slope (Field) to Terrace (Field)," "Dry (Field) to Paddy (Field)," "Tool Reform," "System Reform," "Improvement of Labor Organization," "Improvement of Ideological Style," "Major Rectification and Major Reform," and so on, and so forth. That is to say, the various tasks we have done in the past few years are almost all "reform" work, the various movements carried out are almost all "reform" movements, and the various achievements and experiences obtained are almost all "reform" achievements and experiences.

Why is it that in this period, our work and movements and the achievements and experiences obtained are almost all "reform" work, "reform" movements, and "reform" achievements and experiences? This is because the transformation from a bourgeois democratic revolution to a socialist revolution has brought about two major changes that have never happened before: one is the change in the relations of production, that is, in the ownership of the means of production. This is a fundamental change in the various social system changes that have occurred since human society entered class society. This change did not occur when slave society was transformed into feudal society or when feudal society was transformed into capitalist society. Another change is in the state power, which has produced a people's democratic dictatorship (in essence, a proletarian dictatorship). This is also something that has never happened in the history of class society. Due to this fundamental change in the relations of production and state power, a series of changes will inevitably be caused in the superstructure, such as policies, laws, regulations, systems, moral ideas, and cultural education, so that the latter adapts to the former and serves the former. At the same time, because of this great change in the relations of production and state power, the shackles that bound the rapid development of productive forces have been broken, thereby promoting the rapid development of social productive forces. The various reforms we have carried out in industrial and agricultural production, such as tool reform, soil improvement, and variety improvement, are all specific signs of the rapid development of social productive forces. Since "reform" is a characteristic of the various tasks and movements we have carried out throughout the socialist transition period, then, in carrying out various "reform" tasks and launching various "reform" movements, what things are worth paying special attention to and learning from? I think:

First of all, it is necessary to understand and clarify the object and purpose of "reform" so that the various "reform" tasks we carry out and the various "reform" movements we launch have a high degree of consciousness and minimize their blindness. For example, the object of land reform is the landlord class, especially those big landlords and despotic landlords. If the object of "reform" is wrong, it will be a line error. The objects of "reform," specifically speaking, are too numerous to count, but generally speaking, they are nothing more than transforming the objective world (nature and society) and transforming people's subjective world, transforming people's cognitive abilities. The purpose of "reform" is nothing more than transforming one's own subjective world to make it adapt to and conform to the objective world, overcoming the one-sidedness and limitations of people's subjective world; transforming the objective world so that the objective world (including the social and natural) can gradually meet the growing material and cultural needs of members of society. If the purpose of the change is wrong, it will become a reversal.

Secondly, it is necessary to stand firm on the position of "reform". People have used their best efforts to transform the objective world and transform their own subjective world. Is there a standard of right and wrong, good or bad, for this "reform" work and movement? Yes, anything that is "reformed" in accordance with the interests of the vast majority of the people is right and good; anything that is "reformed" not in accordance with the interests of the vast majority of the people is wrong and bad. The interests of the vast majority of the people are the criterion of truth and the guarantee for the final victory of the "reform" work and movement. The reason why the State Council was able to quickly quell the armed rebellion launched by the original Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group recently is because the State Council's resolute and thorough policy and measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion, that is, the struggle against the original Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group, is completely in line with the interests of the people of the whole country, first of all, in complete agreement with the interests of the vast majority of Tibetans.

Third, it is necessary to pay attention to the method of "reform". Every "reform" work or movement has its own characteristics and its own laws of development. For example, the characteristics and laws of development of land reform are different from ideological remolding, and the characteristics and laws of development of tool reform are also different from writing reform. Even reforms of things of the same nature have different characteristics and laws of development due to different conditions, times, and places. That is to say, when we carry out various "reform" tasks and launch various "reform" movements, in terms of the "reform" method (method), we should adapt to the circumstances, people, time, and place, and we must not and cannot be uniform. This is what Chairman Mao said: "Use different methods to solve different contradictions" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, page 299). This refers to the difference in the method of "reform". How do we discover this difference in the method of "reform"? The only correct method is the method of "seeking truth from facts" repeatedly pointed out by Chairman Mao, that is, the method of conducting specific analysis of specific things. Then, in terms of the method of "reform", is there any commonality? Yes, that is the method of putting politics in command and the mass line that we often say and use. These two methods must be used whether it is to transform society, transform nature, or transform people's minds, and it is impossible to "reform" well without them.

Fourth, it is necessary to choose the timing of "reform". Whether it is to transform society, transform nature, or transform ideas, in order to achieve good results, it is necessary to pay attention to timing. The so-called timing means that not only is there a need for "reform" subjectively, but also the possibility of "reform" objectively, especially the possibility of large-scale mass "reform". Otherwise, it will be a subjective error, and not only will it not be "reformed" well, but it will also "reform" out problems. For example, land reform can only be carried out on a large scale after the military victory has been consolidated, the people's regime has been established, and the struggle to suppress bandits, oppose bullies, and even reduce rent and interest has achieved victory. For example, the "three major transformations" movement could only form such a magnificent high tide of mass movement on a national scale under the specific political and economic conditions in China in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956. Not only is the transformation of society like this, but the transformation of nature is also the same. Like the large-scale mass movement to build water conservancy projects and deeply plow the land in 1958, which transformed nature, it would have been impossible without the conditions of advanced agricultural cooperation and people's communization.

Fifth, it is necessary to be good at organizing and mobilizing the power of "reform". Whether it is to transform society, transform nature, or transform people's thoughts (habits), it is a struggle between new and old forces. In this struggle, the newly emerging forces will inevitably encounter stubborn resistance from all kinds of old forces. Therefore, our slogan is: "Dare to change, resolutely change, thoroughly change." In order to realize this slogan, in order to carry out any decent "reform", there must be a strong force, and this strong force today is the workers, peasants and the broad revolutionary intellectuals. In order to give full play to their strength and wisdom, it is necessary to thoroughly implement the mass line and carry out mass movements on a large scale.

Finally, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of "reform". Since any decent "reform" work and "reform" movement require large-scale mass movements, and any decent mass movement cannot be launched without correct, strong, and experienced leadership, even if it is launched, it is impossible to achieve final victory. So, who are the leaders of the various "reform" works and "reform" movements in the historical era of socialist revolution? That is the working class, first of all, the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party. Historical facts prove that the correct, strong, and long-tested leadership of the Communist Party is the guarantee that the various "reform" works and "reform" movements can be carried out healthily and can achieve final victory.

### 谈“改”

    谈“改”
    刘子久
    今年是伟大的中华人民共和国建国的十周年。大家都在忙着完成和超额完成1959年继续大跃进的计划指标，并且总结这个伟大的十年来的工作成绩和经验，来迎接国庆十周年。在我国的历史上，这个十年确实是伟大的，在政治、军事、经济、思想、文教等各个战线上都取得了辉煌的成就。对于这个伟大的十年，我反来复去地想了一下，想到了这样一个问题，即在这个伟大的十年中，全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，所作的各种工作，开展的各种运动，获得的各种成绩和经验，几乎没有一样不和“改”这个字有关。如“土地制度改革”“民主改革”“社会主义改造”“思想改造”“劳动改造”“教学改革”“戏剧改革”“文字改革”“司法改革”“工资制度改革”“改良土壤”“改良品种”“单（季）双改”“坡（田）改梯（田）”“旱（田）改水（田）”“工具改革”“制度改革”“改善劳动组织”“改进思想作风”“大整大改”等等，不一而足。这就是说，几年来我们所作的各种工作，几乎都是一些“改”的工作，开展的各种运动，几乎都是一些“改”的运动，取得的各种成绩和经验也几乎都是一些“改”的成绩和经验。
    为什么在这个时期，我们的工作和运动及其所获得的成绩和经验，几乎都是一些“改”的工作、“改”的运动和“改”的成绩和经验呢？这是因为由资产阶级性质的民主革命转变为社会主义革命，发生了前所未有的两个大变化：一是在生产关系方面，即在生产资料的所有制方面所发生的变革，这是自从人类社会进入阶级社会之后所发生的历次社会制度的变革中一次带有根本性质的变革。这种变革在由奴隶社会转变为封建社会或由封建社会转变为资本主义社会的时候都未曾发生过。另一变革是在国家政权方面，产生了人民民主专政（实质上是无产阶级专政），这也是阶级社会的历史上从来未有过的事情。由于在生产关系方面和国家政权方面发生了这种根本性质的变革，从而在上层建筑，如政策、法令、规章、制度、道德思想、文化教育等方面，必然要引起一系列的变革，使后者和前者相适应，并为前者服务。同时，又由于生产关系方面和国家政权方面发生了这种大变革，打破了束缚生产力迅速向前发展的枷锁，从而推动了社会生产力迅速地向前发展。在工农业生产方面，我们所进行的各种改革，如工具改革、改良土壤、改良品种等等，都是社会生产力迅速向前发展的具体标志。既然“改”是在整个社会主义的过渡时期我们所进行的各种工作和各种运动的一种特征，那么，我们在进行各种“改”的工作，开展各种“改”的运动方面，有些什么东西值得特别加以注意和学习的呢？我认为：
    首先，就是要了解并且明确“改”的对象和目的。使我们所进行的各种“改”的工作，开展的各种“改”的运动，都具有高度的自觉性，尽可能地减少它的盲目性。譬如说，土地制度改革的对象是地主阶级，特别是那些大地主和恶霸地主。“改”的对象如果搞错了，就会犯路线错误。“改”的对象，具体地讲起来，虽然多得不可胜数，但是概括地讲起来，却不外是改造客观世界（自然与社会）和改造人的主观世界，改造人们的认识能力。“改”的目的，不外是改造自己的主观世界，使它和客观世界相适应，相符合，克服人们的主观世界的片面性、局限性；改造客观世界，使客观世界（包括社会的和自然的）能够逐步地满足社会成员不断增长的物质和文化生活的需要。如果改的目的错了，就会变成开倒车。
    其次，就是要站稳“改”的立场。人们用了最大的努力去改造客观世界、改造自己的主观世界，而这种“改”的工作和运动，有没有一个是非、好坏的标准呢？有，凡是“改”得合乎绝大多数人民的利益的，就是对的、好的，“改”得不合乎绝大多数人民的利益的，就是不对的、不好的。绝大多数人的利益就是真理的标准，也是“改”的工作和运动能够取得最后胜利的保证。最近国务院对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱之所以能够迅速地平定，就是因为国务院所采取的坚决彻底平定西藏叛乱的方针和措施，也就是对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所进行的斗争，是完全符合全国人民的利益，首先是完全符合西藏绝大多数人的利益的缘故。
    第三，就是要讲求“改”的方法。每一种“改”的工作或运动，都有它自己的特点和它自己的发展规律，比如说，土地制度改革的特点和发展规律与思想改造不同，工具改革的特点和发展规律也同文字改革不一样。就是同类性质的事物的改革，由于条件、时间、地点的不同，它们的特点和发展规律，也不完全相同。这就是说，在我们进行各种“改”的工作、开展各种“改”的运动的时候，在“改”的方法（方式）方面要因事、因人、因时、因地制宜，千万不可也不能千篇一律。这就是毛主席所说的：“用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾”（毛泽东选集，二九九页）。这是说的“改”的方法的差别性。我们怎样去发现“改”的方法的这种差别性呢？唯一的正确的方法，就是毛主席一再指出的“实事求是”的方法，就是对于具体事物进行具体分析的方法。那么，在“改”的方法方面，有没有共同性呢？有，那就是我们所常说常用的政治挂帅和群众路线的方法。这两种方法，无论改造社会也好，改造自然和改造人的思想也好，都非用不可，不用就不可能“改”好。
    第四，就是要选择“改”的时机。无论是改造社会，改造自然，还是改造思想，要想得到良好的效果，就非注意时机不可。所谓时机，就是不但在主观上有“改”的需要，而且在客观上也具备了“改”的可能，特别是那种大规模地群众性的“改”的可能。否则，就要犯主观主义的错误，不但“改”不好，而且还会“改”出毛病来。例如土地制度的改革，只有在军事胜利已经稳固，人民政权已经建立，剿匪反霸以至减租减息的斗争已经取得了胜利之后，才能够大规模地进行。又如，“三大改造”运动，只有在我国1955年冬和1956年春那种具体的政治条件和经济条件下，才有可能在全国范围内形成那样一种波澜壮阔的群众运动的高潮。不但改造社会是如此，改造自然也是一样。像1958年大修水利运动和深翻土地这种改造自然的大规模的群众运动，如果没有高级农业合作化和人民公社化这些条件，是根本不可能的。
    第五，就是善于组织和动员“改”的力量。无论改造社会、改造自然和改造人的思想（习惯），都是一种新与旧的势力的斗争。在这种斗争中，新生的势力必然会遇到形形色色的旧的势力的顽强地抵抗。所以我们的口号是：“大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改”。要想实现这个口号，要想进行任何一种像样的
  “改”，就非有一种强大的力量不可，这种强大的力量，在今天说来就是工人、农民和广大的革命知识分子。为了把他们的力量和智慧充分地发挥出来，就非贯彻执行群众路线，大搞群众运动不可。
    最后，就是要加强“改”的领导。既然任何一种像样的“改”的工作和“改”的运动，都需要大搞群众运动，而任何一种像样的群众运动，如果没有正确的坚强的有经验的领导是搞不起来的，即便搞起来也不可能得到最后的胜利。那么，在社会主义革命的历史时代，各种“改”的工作和“改”的运动的领导者是谁呢？那就是工人阶级，首先是工人阶级的先锋队——共产党。历史的事实证明，正确的坚强的久经斗争考验的共产党的领导，是使各种“改”的工作和“改”的运动能够健康的进行并且能够获得最后胜利的保证。
