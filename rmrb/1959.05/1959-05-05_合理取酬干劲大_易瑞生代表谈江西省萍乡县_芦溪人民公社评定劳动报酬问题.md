Comrades Chairman and Representatives:
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am Yi Ruisheng, the director of the Luxi People's Commune in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province. Now, I will give a brief report to the congress on the agricultural production situation last year and the rectification of labor organization to improve labor efficiency.
    In 1958, like all other people's communes in the province, our commune achieved great results in industrial and agricultural production. The total grain output of the commune reached 44,230,000 jin, an increase of 137 percent compared to 1957. The production of various economic crops also increased significantly. The total value of industrial and agricultural output reached 5,180,000 yuan, an increase of 117 percent compared to 1957. The income of each of the 35,640 members of the commune averaged 145 yuan. Commune members universally increased their income, and everyone was beaming with joy. The elderly were living younger and younger, and the young were living happier and happier.
    In 1958, in our area, for more than 100 days from late May to late September, there was very little rain, and the sky was scorching. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we put forward the battle cry of "Demanding water from rivers, demanding grain from the fields, and driving the Dragon King to his death!" All commune members demonstrated soaring enthusiasm in the fight against drought, working day and night, and finally overcame the drought, ensuring a bumper harvest of early rice, late rice, and other crops. Commune members said: "Golden roads and silver bridges are not as good as the happy road of the commune. Production is leaping forward, life is sweet, and it's getting better and better as we move forward." These words show that the masses have realized the great superiority of the people's commune from the bottom of their hearts.
    However, since the commune was established for a short time, our experience was still insufficient, and some shortcomings appeared in our work. After we established the commune in September last year, we adopted an eight-grade wage system that used wages to match grades, fixed grades, and fixed wages. We divided the total estimated wage amount for the year by the number of people participating in the grading to calculate the average wage per person, and then determined the wage difference between each grade based on the number of people in each grade. This grading method did not involve a wide enough range of commune members and could not mobilize all the labor force. According to past experience, the full labor force and semi-labor force should account for 50 percent of the total population, and the auxiliary labor force should account for 25 percent, totaling about 75 percent of the total population. However, the grading result only accounted for 45 percent. In order to mobilize the full labor force, semi-labor force, and auxiliary labor force to actively participate in production, to realize a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and to implement the principle of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work, the commune decided that the production brigade would implement the "four fixes" (fix land, fix cattle, fix farm tools, fix labor force) and "three guarantees" (guarantee work, guarantee output, guarantee cost) for the production team. At the same time, we implemented quota management with flexible assessment for commune members. The wage grades were changed from the original eight grades to ten grades, that is, one grade for each point of basic labor score. Those whose work quantity and quality exceed the quota can increase work points, and those who do not complete the quota will be deducted points. The original fixed monthly wage was changed to monthly or seasonal advance payments, with a final settlement at the end of the year. In this way, the commune cadres and members are very familiar with it, and everyone is satisfied. For example, after the Nianfeng Brigade implemented flexible assessment, to transport grain from the Da'anling mountain, which is 130 li away, normally takes two days for a round trip. Therefore, the quota stipulates that 20 points are recorded for transporting 100 jin of grain. Five of them went and used carts to push the grain, left early, and returned before dark that afternoon. They pushed a total of 990 jin of grain, averaging 198 jin per person. This fully shows that the method of grading according to basic points and implementing flexible assessment can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of the full labor force, semi-labor force, and auxiliary labor force, but also more effectively implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work, more pay for more work." Commune members believe that "this method is really fair and reasonable." They said, "Distribute according to labor, more pay for more work, everyone will work harder."
    Our commune has already done this, and now not only has the labor attendance rate reached more than 95 percent, but also the labor efficiency is very high. Everyone is striving to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959.
    If there are any improper aspects in the above speech, please criticize and correct them.

    合理取酬干劲大
    易瑞生代表谈江西省萍乡县
    芦溪人民公社评定劳动报酬问题主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。我是江西省萍乡县芦溪人民公社的社主任，现在我就关于去年农业生产情况和整顿劳动组织，提高劳动效率问题，向大会作一简要汇报：
    一九五八年，我社同全省各人民公社一样，在工农业生产上都取得了很大的成绩。全社粮食总产量达到四千四百二十三万斤，较一九五七年增长百分之一百三十七，各种经济作物的生产，也有很大增长。工农业总产值达到五百一十八万元，较一九五七年增长百分之一百一十七，全社三万五千六百四十人，每人平均收入达到一百四十五元。社员都普遍的增加了收入，个个喜笑颜开，真是老年人越活越年轻，青年人越活越高兴。
    一九五八年，在我们那里，从五月下旬到九月下旬有一百多天，下雨很少，天都晴起火来了。在共产党和人民政府的领导下，我们提出了“向河川要水，向田地要粮，活活气死老龙王”的战斗口号，全体社员在抗旱生产中，都发挥了冲天的干劲，日夜苦战，终于战胜了旱灾，保证了早稻、晚稻和其他农作物的大丰收。社员说：“黄金路来白银桥，那抵公社幸福道，生产飞跃生活甜，越往前走越美好。”这几句话说明了群众从心坎里认识了人民公社的巨大优越性。
    但是，由于公社建立时间很短，我们的经验还不足，在工作中也出现了一些缺点。我们自去年九月间成立公社以后，采取以工资套级别，死级别、死工资的八级工资制，用全年预计工资总额除参加评级的人数，算出每人的平均工资，再根据各级人数多少，定出各级工资的差额。这种评级的办法，使参加评级的社员不够广泛，也不能把全部劳动力都调动起来。根据过去的情况，全劳动力和半劳动力要占总人口的百分之五十，附带劳动力占百分之二十五，合起来要占总人口的百分之七十五左右。但是评级结果，只占百分之四十五。为了将全劳动力、半劳动力和附带劳动力全部调动起来，积极参加生产，实现工农业生产的更大跃进，贯彻按劳分配，多劳多得的原则，公社确定由生产大队对生产队实行“四定”（定土地、定耕牛、定农具、定劳动力）、“三包”（包工、包产、包成本）的办法，同时对社员实行死级活评的定额管理。在工资级别上由原来八级改为十级，即按劳动底分一分为一级。凡工作数量与质量超过定额的，可以增加工分，没有完成定额的要扣分。在工资上由原来的每月固定工资改为按月或季节预支，年终结算。这样作，社干部和社员都很熟悉，大家满意。如年丰大队实行了死级活评以后，到来回距离一百三十华里的大安岭挑谷，在正常情况下，往返需两天，因此，定额规定如挑一百斤谷记二十分，他们去了五个人用车子推，起早去，当天下午天没黑就回来了，共推谷九百九十斤，每人平均推一百九十八斤。这就充分说明了按底分评级和实行死级活评的办法，既能把全劳动力、半劳动力和附带劳动力的积极性全部调动起来，并能更切实地贯彻各尽所能，按劳分配，多劳多得的原则。社员们认为：“这种办法真是公平合理”，他们说：“按劳分配，多劳多得，人人都会加劲干。”
    我们社已经按照这样办法作了，现在不但劳动出勤率达到了百分之九十五以上，而且劳动效率也很高，大家正为实现一九五九年的更大跃进而奋斗。
    以上发言，如有不妥之处，请代表们批评指正。
