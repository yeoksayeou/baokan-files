Xinhua News Agency, London, May 15th: Even British bourgeois newspapers do not conceal the fact that the "package plan" proposed by the Western three countries at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 14th is a manifestation of the Western countries' lack of sincerity towards this meeting.

    The "News Chronicle" published an editorial today stating that "Under the current package plan, it is impossible for the Russians to accept it under any circumstances" and "If we insist on the package, a deadlock will definitely be formed."

    The newspaper also pointed out that the West's proposal of this plan, which fundamentally ignores the main agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, is aimed at making exorbitant demands and obstructing the normal progress of the meeting. It hopes that the West will be more "flexible" and make temporary solutions on issues where progress is possible.

    The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also revealed the essence of the Western plan in one sentence. The newspaper said in an editorial today, "What the West has already done is to express its willingness to negotiate without fundamentally changing its previous position."

    The newspaper rehashed the so-called "plundering threat" of the Soviet Union to West Berlin. On the other hand, it had to admit that the Western plan aimed to create difficulties for the meeting. It compared the Foreign Ministers' Conference to a business deal, and also openly stated that what the West was peddling did not contain the issues that the other party hoped to resolve. It said that the Western "package plan" is an arrangement in which "the seller tries to make the buyer pay for a bag of stamps, of which only one is needed, and the others are not wanted. From this point of view, the bag that the Western foreign ministers promoted to the Soviet Union yesterday did not contain that important component." The editorial also said, "None of these (Western) proposals are in line with the words and spirit of the Soviet Union's demands," and they "cleanly bypassed" the issues raised by the Soviet Union for discussion at the conference, namely the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue.

    "Daily Express" reporter Clark wrote in a dispatch from Geneva that if the West insists that its "package plan" cannot be拆开拆开拆开apart, "all serious delegations in Geneva might as well leave their round or square tables immediately and go home."

    Xinhua News Agency, London, May 15th: The London "Times," which usually reflects government viewpoints, commented on the "package plan" proposed by the Western three countries at the Geneva Conference in an editorial on the 15th: "It must be pointed out that the current plan, by putting such a wide range of things together, raises the danger that nothing may progress. Even the Berlin issue, which urgently needs to be resolved, is also listed as part of a comprehensive, all-encompassing disarmament plan."

    The editorial said, "Although everyone (in the West) admits that a temporary solution to the Berlin issue is necessary, acceptance of this solution currently seems to depend on acceptance of the entire plan."

    The "Times" expressed concern about Britain's departure from its original position under the pressure of its allies. The newspaper said: "It is particularly surprising that Mr. Macmillan's proposal in Moscow regarding the adjustment of armaments and armed forces in Central Europe has not been given enough attention. Admittedly, the Moscow communique only mentioned 'limiting' armaments and armed forces and establishing 'appropriate inspection systems.' It did not immediately mention 'reduction,' but this proposal was generally regarded as an experimental plan for supervised disarmament. It is difficult to imagine what supervision and inspection can be talked about without some reductions."

    The newspaper listed three points, believing that they are "the most promising way forward." These three points are: "Continuing efforts to reach a solid agreement on the Berlin issue, clearly defining the status of Berlin; arranging technical contacts between the two parts of Germany; and resolving the issue of stopping nuclear tests now." It said: "Mr. Khrushchev has made it clear that if an agreement is not reached or negotiations to reach an agreement are not conducted seriously, he will quickly conclude a peace treaty with East Germany (German Democratic Republic) and transfer traffic lines to Berlin."

    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Bonn dispatch: West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said in a speech that the package plan proposed by Western countries at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference "cannot constitute the basis for reunification (of Germany) and European security."

    Ollenhauer said that he would make a final judgment after carefully studying the details of the Western plan, but he said that, unfortunately, after reading it for the first time, he got this impression. (Attached picture)

### 英国报纸道破西方“一揽子计划”的实质  绕过主要议题　阻挠会议进展

    英国报纸道破西方“一揽子计划”的实质
    绕过主要议题　阻挠会议进展
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：连英国的资产阶级报纸也不隐讳这样一点：西方三国14日在日内瓦外长会议上提出的“一揽子计划”，是西方国家对待这次会议缺乏诚意的表现。
      “新闻纪事报”今天发表社论说，“照目下的一揽子计划，俄国人是无论如何不可能接受的”，“如果我们坚持一揽子，肯定将形成僵局”。
    这家报纸还指出，西方提出这项根本无视外长会议主要议题的计划，其目的是漫天要价，阻挠会议的正常进展。它希望西方“灵活”一些，在凡是可能获得进展的问题上作出临时解决的办法。
    保守党的“每日电讯报”也一语道破西方计划的实质。这家报纸今天在社论中说，“西方所已经做的，是在根本上不改变它以前的立场而又表示它愿意谈判”。
    这家报纸一方面重弹什么苏联对西柏林的“掠夺的威胁”，但是另方面也不得不承认，西方的计划旨在给会议制造困难。它把外长会议比喻为一宗买卖，同时也公开说，西方兜售的东西里没有对方所希望解决的问题。它说，西方的“一揽子计划”是这样一种安排，“卖主力图使买主出钱买一袋邮票，其中只有一张是他需要的，其他都是他不要的。从这个意义出发，西方外长们昨天向苏联推销的口袋里，却没有那一个重要的成分”。社论还说，“这些（西方）建议中没有一点是符合苏联的要求的文字和精神的”，它们“干干净净地绕过了”苏联所提出的、在这次会议上讨论对德和约问题和西柏林问题。
      “每日快报”记者克拉克从日内瓦发回的消息写道，如果西方坚持它的“一揽子计划”不能拆开的话，“所有在日内瓦的严肃的代表团不如立即离开他们的圆桌或方桌而回家去吧”。
    新华社伦敦15日电　通常反映政府观点的伦敦“泰晤士报”15日在社论中评西方三国在日内瓦会议上提出的“一揽子计划”说：“必须指出，目前的计划由于把这么广泛的事情凑到一起，就引起这样的危险：任何事情都可能无所进展。甚至迫待解决的柏林问题也被列为全盘的、无所不包的整个裁军计划的一部分。”
    社论说，“虽然（西方）大家都承认，柏林问题的临时解决办法是必要的，但是，对这个解决办法的接受看来目前还取决于对整个计划的接受。”
    “泰晤士报”对英国在它的盟国的压力下离开原先的立场这一点表示不安。报纸说：“尤其令人惊异的是：对麦克米伦先生在莫斯科提出的关于调整中欧的军备和武装力量的主张太不重视了。诚然，莫斯科公报仅仅谈到‘限制’军备和武装力量，并建立‘适当的检查制度’。它没有马上谈到‘裁减’，但是，这个主张被普遍认为是一个进行有监督的裁军的试验性计划。很难设想：没有某些裁减，谈得上什么监督和检查。”
    这家报纸列举三点，认为它们是“最有希望的前进道路”。这三点是：“继续努力达成一个关于柏林问题的牢靠的协议，明白确定柏林的地位；安排德国两部分的技术性接触；以及现在就解决停止核试验问题。”它说：“赫鲁晓夫先生已经讲明：如果未能达成协议或者不认真进行达成协议的谈判，他将迅速同东德（德意志民主共和国）缔结和约并移交通向柏林的交通线。”
    新华社15日讯　波恩消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在一次讲话中说，西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上所提出的一揽子计划“不能构成重新统一（德国）和欧洲安全的基础”。
    奥伦豪尔说，他要在仔细研究西方计划的细节以后才能作出最后论断，但是他说，不幸，在读了第一遍以后，他得到这样的印象。（附图片）
