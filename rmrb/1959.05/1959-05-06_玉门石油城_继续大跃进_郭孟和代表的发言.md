Yumen Oil City Continues the Great Leap Forward
Speech by Delegate Guo Menghe

Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Those imperialists and Indian interventionists who, in the name of "sympathizing with Tibetans," are scheming to seize Tibet, your conspiracies will never succeed.

Recently, the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique, under the instigation and condoning of imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, launched a shameful rebellion to undermine the unification of the motherland, which aroused great indignation among the vast number of oil workers in our Yumen City. We resolutely support the State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government, to have the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region exercise the functions and powers of the local government, and to task the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion. A few days ago, a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" appeared on Indian territory, clamoring for "Tibetan independence" and wantonly slandering our government's ethnic and religious policies, which is truly infuriating and intolerable. On behalf of all oil industry workers in Yumen City, I solemnly warn those imperialists and some expansionist elements in India, as well as some absurd politicians, who, in the name of "sympathizing with Tibetans," are scheming to seize Tibet, your conspiracies will never succeed! You must immediately cease all activities interfering in our internal affairs. In the face of the liberated Chinese people, trying to make speculative deals with the so-called "Tibet issue" will not yield any benefits. It would be beneficial for you to revisit the history of the Chinese people's struggle for national liberation and national unity and integrity.

Yumen Oil Industry Workers Engage in Vigorous Technical Innovation and Self-Reliance, Leading to a Leap Forward in Production

Now, I would like to report to the congress on the Great Leap Forward of Yumen oil industry workers last year and the continued Great Leap Forward this year. Last year, under the leadership of the Party, tens of thousands of oil workers in Yumen put politics in command, liberated their minds, engaged in vigorous technical revolution, and practiced self-reliance, resulting in an all-round leap forward. Crude oil production exceeded the state plan by 41 percent; drilling footage exceeded the quota by 52.2 percent; crude oil processing volume increased by 35.8 percent compared to the original plan; and capital construction was also completed very well, fulfilling 104.8 percent of the state investment plan; labor productivity increased by 26.8 percent compared to 1957. In this year, many previously rare miracles occurred: crude oil production repeatedly leaped forward, increasing by 40 percent compared to 1957; drilling footage was thirteen times that of 1957, and the national drilling record of 6,009 meters drilled per month and 28,050 meters drilled per year by a medium-sized drilling rig was created. This created the possibility of drilling more wells and producing more oil in the future with less manpower and equipment. At the same time, we learned a set of experiences for developing and building oilfields quickly, well, and economically, and learned how to develop natural petroleum enterprises by walking on two legs. For example, last year, without using state investment, we built a refinery with an annual processing capacity of 200,000 tons of crude oil in just 27 days, combining foreign and indigenous methods. All 176 tons of steel used were processed from waste materials found by the masses, and the funds were accumulated from sideline production. More importantly, all employees achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in political and ideological terms. Due to the victory of the rectification campaign, the Party's general line for socialist construction illuminated everyone's heart. Over the past year, the socialist consciousness of the vast number of employees has greatly improved. They do not consider remuneration in their work, actively cooperate in production, and strive for advancement in all aspects. Throughout the year, the vast number of employees put forward more than 2 million technical revolution and technical innovation proposals, large and small, in geological exploration, drilling, oil extraction, refining, transportation, capital construction, and enterprise management, adopted more than 940,000, and created and saved a value of more than 58 million yuan for the country. The achievement of these achievements should be attributed to the wise leadership of our great Party and Chairman Mao, to our incomparably superior socialist system, to the strong support of the people of the whole country, and to the heroic struggle of the vast number of oil workers. This is the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction!

This year, Yumen, as the first completed petroleum industrial base in the country, has started a larger and better Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year's victory. Crude oil production will increase by 80 to 100 percent compared to last year, providing more and better oil and petroleum products for the country's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and national defense construction. We not only have the determination and confidence to complete the state's petroleum production tasks, but we also resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," making way for the "four major indicators," and we will ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward through our own efforts under the conditions of making way.

A red banner emulation campaign to strive for high yield and high quality has leaped out of Yumen Pass

Of course, the tasks before us are arduous, and there are still many difficulties. It is not easy to complete this task, but difficulties cannot scare our vast number of oil workers who have been tempered for a long time. Difficulties must be overcome, and tasks must be completed.

Since the beginning of spring, a large-scale mass movement centered on technical revolution has been launched in our oil mine and has achieved great results. In the first quarter of this year, crude oil production increased by more than 98 percent compared to the same period last year, and it will continue to increase in the following quarters. Since the beginning of April, this movement has further developed into a red banner competition movement to strive for high yield and high quality, and the scope of our competition has already crossed Yumen Pass and become a part of the national petroleum industry production competition. The vast number of employees are full of energy and high spirits, and a large number of technical innovation proposals and production increase and savings measures have emerged from the masses. We must turn low-yield oil wells into high-yield oil wells and stabilize the high yield of high-yield oil wells; strive to put new oil wells into production more and faster, and make old oil wells "rejuvenate." And rationally develop oilfields, ensuring this year's output and taking care of long-term exploitation.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has given us important weapons. Following the instructions of the Party, and according to the principle of prioritizing what is important and urgent, we have already used our main strength to increase crude oil production and transferred our crack troops to the Ya'erxia high-yield oilfield. We must make our utmost efforts to do our work solidly and meticulously, strive for the largest output and the best quality with the least financial and material resources, and ensure the victorious completion of the state plan.

In order to actively make way and simultaneously achieve the Great Leap Forward, develop production and simultaneously improve the lives of employees, we are tapping potential to vigorously develop self-reliance under the condition of ensuring the completion of crude oil production tasks, manufacturing some simple equipment and accessories by combining foreign and indigenous methods to ensure part of the needs of production and reduce the burden on the country. At the same time, we also build simple houses, grow vegetables, and raise pigs ourselves to increase employee welfare in order to better stimulate the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of employees to increase production.

Fellow delegates, the people of the whole country call Yumen the "Oil City," which is an honor given to us by the people. We will never fail the expectations of the Party and the people!

　　玉门石油城　继续大跃进
    郭孟和代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和衷心拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    那些以“同情西藏人”为名，野心攫取西藏为实的帝国主义和印度干涉者，你们的阴谋诡计永远不能得逞
    最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派指使和纵容下所发动的破坏祖国统一的可耻叛乱，引起了我们玉门市广大石油工人的极大愤怒。我们坚决拥护国务院所发布的解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，责成人民解放军西藏军区部队彻底平息叛乱的命令。前几天，在印度的领土上，又出现了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，叫嚷什么“西藏独立”，并且肆意污蔑我国政府的民族政策和宗教政策，实在令人愤慨和难以容忍。我代表玉门市全体石油工业职工，严正警告那些以“同情西藏人”为名、野心攫取西藏为实的帝国主义者和印度的某些扩张主义分子，以及一些荒唐的政治家，你们的阴谋诡计万难得逞！必须立即停止一切干涉我国内政的活动。在解放了的中国人民面前，用所谓“西藏问题”作投机生意，是一点油水也不会捞到的，重温一下中国人民争取民族解放和国家统一完整的斗争历史，对你们是有益的。
    玉门石油工业职工大闹技术革新自力更生，生产上出现了一个跃进局面
    现在，我向大会汇报一下玉门石油工业职工去年大跃进和今年继续大跃进的情况。去年，玉门的几万名石油职工，在党的领导下，政治挂帅，思想解放，大闹技术革命，大搞自力更生，出现了一个全面的跃进局面。原油生产超过了国家计划的百分之四十一；钻井进尺超额百分之五十二点二；原油处理量比原计划提高了百分之三十五点八；基本建设也完成得很好，完成了国家投资计划的百分之一百零四点八；劳动生产率比一九五七年提高了百分之二十六点八。在这一年中，出现了许多以往少见的奇迹：原油产量一再跃进，比一九五七年增长百分之四十；钻井进尺为一九五七年的十三倍，并且创造了中型钻机月钻六千零九公尺、年钻二万八千零五十公尺的全国钻井最高纪录，这样，就为今后用较少的人力、设备，打更多的井，产更多的油创造了可能性。同时，摸到了一套多快好省地开发和建设油田的经验，学会了用两条腿走路来发展天然石油企业的办法。例如，去年我们没有用国家投资，仅以二十七天的时间，就建成了一座年处理二十万吨原油的洋土结合的炼油厂，所用的一百七十六吨钢材，都是群众从废材料中找出来加工制成的，资金也是由搞副业生产积累的。更重要的是，全体职工在政治思想上获得了空前的大丰收。由于整风运动的胜利，党的社会主义建设总路线照亮了每个人的心，一年来，广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，在劳动中不计报酬，生产上主动协作，各个方面力争上游。全年广大职工在地质勘探、钻井、采油、炼油、运输、基本建设和企业管理等方面，提出了大小二百多万件技术革命和技术革新的建议，采纳了九十四万多件，为国家创造和节约的价值达五千八百多万元。这些成就的取得，应归功于我们伟大的党和毛主席的英明领导，归功于我们无比优越的社会主义制度，归功于全国人民的大力支援和广大石油职工的英勇奋斗。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利！
    今年，作为全国第一个建成的石油工业基地的玉门，在去年胜利的基础上，又开始了一个更大、更好的大跃进。原油产量将比去年增长百分之八十到一倍，为国家工农业大跃进和国防建设提供更多、更好的石油和石油产品。我们不仅有决心、有信心完成国家给我们的石油生产任务，而且我们坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，为“四大指标”让路，一定在让路的条件下，通过自己的努力，确保大跃进的实现。
    一个争取高产优质的红旗竞赛运动已经跃出了玉门关
    当然，摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨的，困难也还不少，完成这个任务并不是轻易的，但是，困难吓不倒我们经过长期锻炼的广大石油职工。困难一定要克服，任务一定要完成。
    入春以来，一个大规模的、以技术革命为中心的群众运动，就在我们油矿里开展起来了，并且获得了很大成绩。今年第一季度原油产量比去年同期增加了百分之九十八以上，而且在以后的几个季度里还将继续向上增加。自从四月初以来，这个运动更发展成为一个争取高产、优质的红旗竞赛运动，而且我们竞赛的范围，已经跨出了玉门关，成为全国石油工业生产大竞赛的一部分。广大职工群众干劲十足，意气风发，大量的技术革新建议和增产节约措施，从群众中涌现出来。我们一定要做到把低产油井变成高产油井，使高产油井稳定的高产；力争新油井更多、更快地投入生产，老油井“返老还童”。并且合理地开发油田，既保证今年产量，又照顾长远开采。
    党的八届七中全会给了我们重要武器，我们遵循着党的指示，根据重其所重，急其所急的原则，已经把主要力量用到增产原油上来，把精兵良将调到鸭儿峡高产油田上去了。我们一定尽最大的努力，把工作做得扎扎实实，细细致致，力争用最少的财力物力，求得最大的产量、最好的质量，确保国家计划胜利地完成。
    为了主动让路又同时实现大跃进，发展生产又同时改善职工生活，我们在确保完成原油生产任务的条件下，正在挖掘潜力大搞自力更生，以洋土结合的办法，制造一些简单设备和配件，以保证生产的部分需要，减轻国家的负担。同时，还自己动手修建简易住宅，种菜、养猪，增长职工福利，以更好地激发广大职工群众增加生产的冲天干劲。
    各位代表，全国人民称呼玉门为“石油城”，这是人民给我们的荣誉。我们绝不辜负党和人民对我们的期望！
