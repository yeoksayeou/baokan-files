Ode to the Stockman
By our reporter Zhang Guoning

	One after another, carts loaded with manure pulled away. The drivers waved their whips, and the oxen and draught cattle ran as if the carts were empty. Seeing such energetic livestock, people praised, "Wow! Look how strong the cattle are fed, and how good their condition is!" These dragon-like and tiger-like draught cattle are raised by the stockmen of the Qinjiacun Production Team in the Xinhua Commune.

	Speaking of Qinjiacun, people within a radius of dozens of miles of the Xinhua Commune in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, all agree that their livestock are well-fed. When the reporter arrived here, he saw that the cave dwellings where the livestock were kept were very clean. The dry soil in the paddocks was almost as fine as powder, and even walnut-sized clods of earth could not be found. Stockman Yin Dongfu explained that such padded paddocks are flat and soft, so the livestock can lie down comfortably, and the female animals will not get urinary worms. In the storage area for hay, wheat straw and dried alfalfa were chopped into half-inch lengths; the water in the tanks was so clear that people could see their reflections. Stockman Yin Shouchong was sifting wheat bran. He first sifted it with a coarse sieve, then sifted it again with a fine sieve, and finally added it to the trough. After the livestock had eaten their fill, he used a small broom to scrub the trough clean. I couldn't help but say, "How meticulous!" The stockman replied, "How can we not be meticulous! The person who cooks for the cattle must make the ‘food’ and ‘dishes’ delicious and palatable so that the cattle can eat their fill!" In another cave dwelling, old man Song Delu was bending over and using a small bamboo comb to comb the cow's abdomen over and over again. He said that combing like this will prevent the cows from getting ringworm and lice.

	This team has nine stockmen, most of whom are veterans who have been raising livestock for many years. When they talk about livestock, they are like reciting treasures, so familiar with the livestock they raise. From the small spotted cows to the large draught oxen, they talked about which female animal was about to give birth to a calf, and which cow had learned to pull a plow. Their enthusiasm made people deeply feel that they were full of pride and affection for their work. Stockman Yin Guangjin never harshly beat or scolded the cattle he raised. When a cow kicked (wasn't obedient), he would just kindly say a few words, and the cow would listen. Last autumn, a female animal had a difficult labor when giving birth to a calf at night. The cow tossed and turned violently, lying down and getting up, getting up and lying down, and only one leg of the calf was showing, while the other leg was stuck and couldn't come out. Yin Guangjin, in his urgency, quickly washed his arm with boiling water and helped the cow deliver, finally bringing the calf safely into the world. Afterwards, he busied himself tying off the calf's umbilical cord, cleaning the dirty things from the calf's mouth, coaxing it to nurse, and boiling thin soup for the mother animal to drink. He stayed by her side for two full days and nights.

	Of course, such a conscientious work attitude is not unique to Yin Guangjin. For example, every time Yin Rongguang led the livestock to the trough, he would first stroke the nose of each animal with his palm. If the animal's nose was moist, he would be very happy; if the nose was dry and the ears were cold, it was a sign of illness, then, even in the dark night or on a muddy rainy day, he would go and ask the veterinarian to come and take a look. "Night grazing can fatten a thousand-mile horse," is an experience that people have summarized for many years. Therefore, he is more attentive when feeding livestock at night. Sometimes, even though he is very sleepy, he still sits beside the trough, taking care of each animal to eat well. He knows very well which cow eats well, what it likes to eat, and how much it eats. He often says to others that livestock have problems, whether they can eat their fill, they can't say it, how can we know without carefully figuring it out?

	Speaking of the experience of raising livestock, Qin Zhende and Song Delu almost endlessly said: To raise livestock well, wheat bran and wheat straw must be mixed; feed them well in slack months so they can eat their fill in busy months (indicating the importance of feeding livestock well at ordinary times); add more water to the grass in summer to avoid dry mouths and tongues in livestock; add less water when mixing grass in winter, otherwise the feed will freeze; after the green grass is chopped in summer, it should be spread out to let the heat dissipate before feeding, and it is best to give the cattle a little egg white to prevent heatstroke. They can recite fluently how to take care of cows during estrus and pregnancy, and so on.

	They have also accumulated a lot of experience in the use of livestock: such as quantifying labor and rest according to the workload; and pairing fast and slow cattle to pull carts separately. They also attach importance to carrying out publicity work on loving and protecting livestock to the commune members who use livestock.

	The stockmen's hard work, day after day, year after year, has enabled Qinjiacun to increase its livestock from few to many, and achieve a double harvest of grain and livestock. When the commune was first established in 1956, there were only fifty livestock in the village, most of which were old and short. Now the village has seventy-six cattle and donkeys, all of which are well-fed and strong. Two or three years ago, each draught animal was burdened with more than thirty mu of land, now it is only burdened with twenty-one mu of land. With more livestock, there is enough manure, and grain production has increased year by year. How can these be separated from the outstanding work of the stockmen?

    饲养员赞
    本报记者  张国宁
    一辆又一辆装得满满的粪车拉走了。赶车的挥舞一下鞭子，辕牛和拉捎牛就跑了起来，好像是拉空车似的。人们看见这样得劲的牲畜，都称赞地说：“嗬！看那牛喂得多壮，膘色多好！”这些如龙似虎的耕牛就是由新华公社秦家庄生产小队饲养员们喂养的。
    提起秦家庄，陕西乾县新华公社方圆数十里的人都公认他们的牲畜喂的好。当记者来到这里时，只见那一孔孔喂牲畜的窑洞打扫得真干净；垫圈的干土几乎和粉末一样细碎，连核桃大的土圪瘩都挑不出来。饲养员殷东富解释说，这样垫的圈平整、松软，牲口卧下舒适，母畜也不会生尿蛐子。在储草处，麦草和干＠蓿成半寸多长；缸里的水清彻得能照见人影。饲养员殷寿忠正在筛麦糠，他先用粗筛筛了一遍，又用细筛去筛，最后才添到槽里去。牲畜吃饱了，他又用小扫帚把槽刷洗得干干净净。我不禁说道：“好细呀！”饲养员回答说：“怎能不细！给牛当厨子的人，就是要把
  ‘饭’、‘菜’做得美味可口，让牛吃饱吃好呀！”在另一孔窑洞里，宋德禄老汉正弯着腰用小竹篦在牛的腹部一遍又一遍地梳刮。他说，这样梳刮，牛身上就不会生癣生虱子。
    这个队有九个饲养员，他们大多是喂了好几年牲口的老手。谈起牲畜来，都如数家珍似的，是那么熟悉自己喂养的牲畜。他们从小花牛谈到驾辕的大犍牛，又谈哪条母畜又快要生牛犊，谈哪条牛又学会拉犁了。那股津津乐道的兴头使人深深感到，他们对自己的工作充满了自豪和感情。饲养员殷光金对自己喂养的牛从来不狠打狠骂，当哪头牛一踢腾（不老实），他只是亲＠地数说上几句，牛就听话了。去年秋天，一头母畜在夜间生犊时难产，母牛翻腾的很厉害，卧倒又起来，起来又卧下，牛犊的腿只露出一条来，另一条腿卡住硬是出不来。殷光金急中生智，赶紧用开水洗了自己的臂膊，给牛助产，终于使牛犊安全地生了下来。以后，他又忙着为牛犊扎包脐带，将牛犊口里的脏东西掏洗干净，诱导它吃奶，又熬稀汤给母畜喝。他守在跟前，整整两天两夜。
    这样兢兢业业的工作态度，当然不止殷光金一个人有。像殷荣光在每一次把牲畜牵上槽后，先要用手掌在每一条牲畜的鼻子上抚摸一下，如果牲畜的鼻子湿漉漉的，他就很高兴；如果鼻子干燥，耳朵发凉，这是有病的象征，那么，即使是漆黑的夜间或泥泞的雨天，他也要去请兽医来看看。“夜草能肥千里马”，这是多少年来人们总结的经验。所以在夜间喂牲畜时他更加经心，有时虽然很困，但他也照例要坐在槽头旁边，照料每一头牲口吃好料。那一头牛吃的好，爱吃什么，食量大小，他都摸得很清楚。他常对别人说，牲畜那里有毛病，能不能吃饱，它又不会说出来，不凭咱仔细捉摸又怎样能行呢？
    要说起喂牲畜的经验来，秦振德、宋德禄几乎是滔滔不绝地说了起来：牲畜要喂好，麦糠麦草两样搅；闲月吃到腿，忙月吃到嘴（说明平时要喂好牲畜的重要）；夏天多用水拌草，避免牲畜口干舌燥；冬天拌草时水要少些，否则饲料就会结成冰；夏天青草铡好后要摊开让热气散掉再喂，最好给牛灌一点鸡蛋清防止中暑。掌握牛的发情、怀孕期间怎样照料，等等，他们都能说得滚瓜烂熟。
    在牲畜使用上，他们也积累了许多经验：如劳逸作息按活路定量；快慢牛分别套车。他们还重视对使用牲畜的社员进行爱畜保畜的宣传工作。
    饲养员们几年如一日的辛勤劳动，使得秦家庄的牲畜由少变多，粮、畜双丰收。1956年刚建社时，全村只有五十头牲畜，大多是口齿老、个子矮的。现在全村有牛、驴七十六条，条条喂养得壮壮实实的。两三年前，每头耕畜负担三十多亩，现在只负担二十一亩地，牲畜多了，粪土也够用了，粮食产量也年年增加了。这些，又怎么能和饲养员们出色的工作分得开呢？
