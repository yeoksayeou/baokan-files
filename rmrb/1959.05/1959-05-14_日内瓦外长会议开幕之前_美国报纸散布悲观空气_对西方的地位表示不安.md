Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 11th: According to TASS, American newspapers have published many commentaries and dispatches on the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opened on the 11th. The tone of most newspapers is that "not much result" should be expected from the Geneva conference. Some commentators simply say that the conference will not have "any practical results." At the same time, these commentators are linking the convocation of a summit conference with the success of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, intending to block the path to a summit meeting. Other commentators believe that the convocation of a high-level meeting is inevitable.

American newspapers expressed unease about the Western countries' position at the Geneva conference. The "New York Times" supported the West's so-called "package plan" for resolving the German issue, demanding that the United States' allies maintain "firmness" and, in any case, not take "separate diplomatic steps."

"New York Herald Tribune" reporter Cooke, in explaining the reason for the anxiety of American officials about the Geneva negotiations, wrote that since the last few meetings, the balance of power between East and West on the world stage has greatly changed.

He said: "This time, Europe is at a crossroads, and no diplomat here is unaware of this situation or fails to take it into consideration. The extent to which questions are being raised and debates are being conducted within the alliance regarding the alliance's established policies is unprecedented. In short, the atmosphere is uneasy because, since the last foreign ministers' conference, the Soviet Union's strength has grown incomparably."

Cooke pointed out that "in the past, the Western allies were able to attend conferences with confidence and even great certainty." Cooke continued, "This year, the situation is completely different."

Cooke concluded: "The Soviet Union's diplomatic position in Geneva this time is perhaps the strongest it has been since World War II, compared to the Western countries. This change in the balance of diplomatic power has caused profound and significant divisions within the Western alliance regarding the attitude towards this historical juncture."

    日内瓦外长会议开幕之前
    美国报纸散布悲观空气
    对西方的地位表示不安
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社纽约11日讯：美国报纸就11日开幕的日内瓦外长会议发表了许多评论和通讯。多数报纸的调子是，“不必期望”日内瓦会议能取得多大的结果。一些评论员干脆说，会议不会“有什么实际结果”。同时，这些评论员把政府首脑会议的召开同日内瓦外长会议是否成功拉扯在一起，打算以此来堵塞召开最高级会议的道路。另一些评论员认为，高级会议的召开是不可避免的。
    美国报纸对西方国家在日内瓦会议的地位表示了不安。“纽约时报”支持西方解决德国问题的所谓“一揽子计划”，要求美国的盟国保持“坚定”，并且无论如何不要采取“单独的外交步骤”。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”记者库克在解释美国官方人士对日内瓦谈判惶惶不安的原因时写道，最近几次会议以来，东西方之间在世界舞台上的力量对比大大改变了。
    他说：“这一次，欧洲处在十字路口，这里任何一位外交家都没有不注意、没有不考虑这种情况的。盟国内部目前就盟国既定政策的立场提出疑问和进行辩论的程度，是以前从来没有过的。总之，气氛是不安的，因为在上次外长会议以后，苏联的力量是不可比拟的壮大了”。
    库克指出，“过去，西方盟国还能够满怀信心甚至是非常有把握地去参加会议”。库克接着写道，“今年，局面就完全不同了”。
    库克最后写道：“苏联这次到日内瓦来的外交地位，与西方国家相比，或许是自从二次世界大战以来最强有力的。这种外交力量对比的变化在西方联盟内部引起了对待这个历史关头的态度问题的深刻而重大的分歧。”
