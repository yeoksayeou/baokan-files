    Overcoming Disasters and Ensuring a Bumper Harvest
    After reading the newsletter about how the cadres and masses of the Sanmao Commune in Yangzhong County protected all the wheat seedlings from damage during a wind and rainstorm, I was very excited. It eloquently proves to people that human power can definitely overcome natural disasters.
    China has a vast territory, and natural disasters occur every year, sometimes in this area, sometimes in that area; sometimes this kind of disaster occurs, sometimes that kind of disaster occurs. The idea of ​​getting a good harvest peacefully is unrealistic. The only correct attitude is to face up to natural disasters, fight them and overcome them. Over the years, people have accumulated a lot of experience in fighting natural disasters, which can be summarized into two types: prevention and resistance. Prevention means estimating the possibility of various natural disasters occurring, and taking various effective measures to actively prevent them before natural disasters occur. Resistance means using human will, human strength, and human wisdom to overcome it once a natural disaster occurs. Therefore, when we deal with natural disasters, we must strive to prevent them from happening and prepare to deal with their occurrence.
    When natural disasters occur, people usually have two thoughts and two attitudes. One is low mood, depression, lack of confidence, and failure to take active measures to overcome disasters; the other is full of emotions, high morale, determination to conquer nature, and taking active and effective measures to overcome disasters. The cadres and masses of the Sanmao Commune adopted the latter attitude. When they were attacked by strong winds and heavy rains, the whole party and the whole people were mobilized, going all out, fighting stubbornly against the strong winds and heavy rains with firm determination, iron will and specific and effective measures, draining the accumulated water from more than 11,000 mu of wheat fields in two days and two nights, and rescuing more than 1,000 mu of lodged wheat. This fact once again tells us that when natural disasters occur in some areas, the cadres and masses with the greatest determination, the most enthusiasm, and the most effective measures will inevitably have the best effect in resisting natural disasters, and it is possible to prevent or reduce damage to crops.
    We say that the wheat harvest is not yet settled, which has two meanings: one is that strengthening management can increase production even more; the other is that it is still possible to encounter natural disasters. The period from now until the wheat harvest is a decisive moment for striving for large-scale, high-yield wheat production. During this period, an important measure to ensure a bumper harvest is to use the greatest strength to prevent and overcome various possible natural disasters such as wind, rain, flooding, and diseases and insect pests.

### 战胜灾害　确保丰收

    战胜灾害　确保丰收
    读了扬中县三茅公社干部群众在大风暴雨的袭击中保住了全部麦苗未受损失的通讯，十分兴奋。它雄辩地向人们证明：人力一定能够战胜天灾。
    我国幅员广阔，自然灾害每年都是有的，只是有时发生在这个地区，有时发生在那个地区；有时发生这种灾害，有时发生那种灾害。那种想太太平平地获得丰收的思想是不现实的。唯一正确的态度是正视自然灾害，与灾害作斗争并战胜它。多少年来，人们在和自然灾害作斗争中，积累了许多经验，概括起来不外乎两种：一是防，一是抗。防，就是要估计到各种自然灾害发生的可能性，在自然灾害发生以前，采取各种有效措施，积极预防。抗，就是一旦发生了自然灾害，以人的意志、人的力量、人的智慧去战胜它。因此，我们对待自然灾害，既要力求使它不发生，又要准备对付它的发生。
    在发生自然灾害时，人们通常有两种思想、两种态度。一种是情绪低落，思想消沉，信心不足，不积极采取措施战胜灾害；一种是情绪饱满，斗志昂扬，抱定人定胜天的决心，采取积极有效的措施，去战胜灾害。三茅公社的干部群众正是采取了后一种态度，他们在受到大风大雨袭击时，全党全民动员，全力以赴，以坚强的决心，钢铁的意志和具体有效的措施向大风大雨顽强搏斗，两天两夜就全部排尽了一万一千多亩麦田的积水，救起了一千多亩倒伏的麦子。这个事实又一次告诉我们：当一些地区发生自然灾害时，哪里的干部群众决心最大，干劲最足，措施最得力，哪里的抗击自然灾害的效果就必然最好，就可能使农作物不受损失或者少受损失。
    我们说麦类收成还没有定局，有两方面的意义：其一是加强管理还能更多增产；其二就是还有可能碰到自然灾害。从现在到麦收这段时间，是力争麦类大面积高额丰产的决定性时刻。在这段时间内，确保丰收的一项重要措施就是用最大的力量预防和战胜各种可能发生的风、雨、涝和病虫等自然灾害。
