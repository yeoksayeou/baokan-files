The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference was originally scheduled to begin on May 11 in Geneva, Switzerland. The mission of this conference is to study the most important and mature issues in current international relations—the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin. The convening of this conference is due to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and peace-loving forces worldwide.

The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have consistently advocated adhering to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, eradicating German militarism and Nazism, and peacefully resolving the German question. Starting with the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference in July 1946, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed discussing a German peace treaty and put forward the basic principles of a draft German peace treaty in March 1952. However, Western countries not only repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's proposals but also accelerated the pace of arming West Germany. At the end of May 1952, Western countries directed Adenauer to sign the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty, which linked West Germany to the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. In May 1955, West Germany was formally pulled into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, since then it has intensified the construction of the "Bundeswehr," and on March 25, 1958, the West German parliament openly passed a resolution on equipping the West German army with nuclear weapons.

Because Western countries incited revanchist sentiments in West Germany, promoted the revival of fascist reactionary organizations and reactionary forces, and West Berlin became a malignant tumor, the situation in Europe became increasingly tense, and peace was increasingly endangered. In view of this situation, the Soviet Union raised the issue of the status of West Berlin in November 1958, pointing out that due to the West's undermining of relevant international agreements, it was necessary to consider ending the occupation regime in Berlin, and suggested that Western countries withdraw their occupying forces from West Berlin. The Soviet Union expressed its readiness to transfer all its powers in Berlin to the German Democratic Republic. On November 27, 1958, the Soviet Union further sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, formally proposing to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city, and pointed out that if no agreement could be reached within a six-month period, the Soviet Union would implement the established measures by reaching an agreement with the German Democratic Republic. This proposal of the Soviet Union was supported by the German Democratic Republic and other peace-loving countries. However, the U.S. State Department hastily issued a memorandum on the Berlin issue, stating that it would stubbornly remain in West Berlin. On December 31, 1958, the United States, Britain, and France replied to the Soviet Union, rejecting the Soviet proposal, and expressed their willingness to hold a four-power foreign ministers' conference for negotiations, but proposed to discuss the issues of holding so-called "free elections" in all of Germany to form an all-German government and the issue of European security, intending to use these issues to obstruct the resolution of the West Berlin issue.

On January 10 this year, the Soviet Union put forward another major measure in resolving the German question, proposing the conclusion of a German peace treaty and submitting a draft German peace treaty. The Soviet Union suggested convening a peace conference within two months to discuss the draft German peace treaty, draft and sign mutually agreed treaty provisions, and reiterated its hope to resolve the West Berlin issue through negotiations between relevant countries. In their reply to the Soviet Union on February 16, the Western countries did not provide any concrete answers, but only engaged in empty talk about their willingness to hold a foreign ministers' conference, provided that the "German question in all its aspects and implications" be discussed, attempting to introduce the German question into endless discussion.

On March 2 this year, the Soviet Union again replied to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, proposing: to convene a summit conference to discuss the German peace treaty, the West Berlin issue, and issues related to safeguarding European security and disarmament, but not including the issue of German reunification, because this issue is a matter for the Germans themselves and can only be resolved by themselves. At the same time, the Soviet Union also proposed that if Western countries were not yet prepared to participate in the summit conference, a foreign ministers' conference could be held, but this conference could only discuss the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. Both conferences should invite representatives from both German states to participate, and it was also necessary for Germany's neighbors, Poland and Czechoslovakia, to participate.

The communiqué of Khrushchev's visit to the German Democratic Republic, published on March 11 this year, proposed that, under the current conditions of the existence of two German states, the German peace treaty could be signed by the two German states; on the issue of eliminating the occupation status of West Berlin, the Soviet Union was willing to jointly guarantee the status of the free city of West Berlin with the United States, Britain, and France, to ensure that West Berlin's internal affairs would not be interfered with, and agreed to have the United Nations guarantee it. If Western countries are genuinely willing to negotiate, the Soviet Union can appropriately postpone the deadline for the transfer of management rights over the transportation lines from West Germany to West Berlin.

The Soviet Union's proposal won popular support. Under the pressure of world public opinion, Western countries had to move from initially completely rejecting the Soviet Union's proposals to ease the tension in Europe to agreeing to sit down and negotiate the Soviet Union's proposals. On March 26, Western countries replied to the Soviet Union, agreeing to hold an East-West foreign ministers' conference in Geneva on May 11 to discuss the German question, including the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue.

### 日内瓦外长会议召开经过

    日内瓦外长会议召开经过
    东西方外长会议原订11日在瑞士日内瓦开始举行。这次会议的使命是，研究目前国际关系中最重要的和已经成熟了的议题——缔结对德和约和消除西柏林占领制度的问题。这次会议之所以能够召开，是由于苏联、德意志民主共和国和全世界爱好和平力量的努力。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国一贯主张恪守波茨坦协定的原则，根绝德国军国主义及纳粹主义以及和平解决德国问题。苏联从1946年7月的巴黎外长会议开始，多次建议讨论对德和约，并于1952年3月提出了对德和约草案的基本原则。但是西方国家不但屡次拒绝了苏联的建议，反而加速了武装西德的步伐。1952年5月底，西方国家指使阿登纳签署了使西德与北大西洋侵略集团相联系的“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团”条约。1955年5月，西德被正式拉进了北大西洋侵略集团，从此它就更加加紧建设“国防军”，到了1958年3月25日，西德议会更公然通过了一项关于以核武器装备西德军队的决议。
    由于西方国家在西德煽动复仇主义的情绪，促使法西斯反动组织和反动势力复活，西柏林变成了一个毒瘤，使得欧洲的局势日趋紧张，和平日益受到危害。鉴于这种情况，苏联在1958年11月提出了西柏林地位问题，指出由于西方的破坏有关国际协定，有必要考虑结束对柏林的占领制度，并建议西方国家从西柏林撤退占领军。苏联表示准备将它在柏林的一切职权移交给德意志民主共和国。1958年11月27日，苏联更进一步照会美、英、法三国政府，正式提出使西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议，并指出，在半年期限之内，如不能达成协议，苏联即将通过与德意志民主共和国达成协议的方式实现既定措施。苏联这个建议得到德意志民主共和国和其他爱好和平国家的支持。但是，美国国务院慌忙发表柏林问题的备忘录，表示要硬赖在西柏林。1958年12月31日，美、英、法复照苏联，拒绝苏联的建议，表示愿意举行四大国外长会议进行谈判，但提出讨论的问题是：举行所谓全德“自由选举”成立全德政府以及欧洲安全问题，它们想用这些问题来阻挠西柏林问题的解决。
    今年1月10日，苏联在解决德国问题方面又提出一个重大措施，提出了缔结对德和约的建议，并提出了对德和约草案。苏联建议在两个月内召开和会来讨论对德和约草案，草拟和签订一致同意的条约条文，并再次表示希望通过有关国家的谈判来解决西柏林问题。西方在2月16日给苏联的复照中没有提出任何具体回答，只是空谈什么愿意举行外长会议，条件是要讨论“德国问题的一切方面和含义”，企图把德国问题引入无休止的讨论。
    今年3月2日苏联又复照美英法三国，提出：召开政府首脑会议，讨论对德和约、西柏林问题及同保障欧洲安全和裁军有关的问题，但不包括德国统一问题，因为这个问题是德国人自己的事，只能由他们自己解决。同时苏联又提出，如果西方国家还不准备参加政府首脑会议，那么可以举行各国外长会议，但这会议只能是讨论对德和约和西柏林问题，两个会议都应邀请两个德国代表参加，德国的邻国波兰和捷克斯洛伐克也有必要参加。
    今年3月11日发表的赫鲁晓夫访问德意志民主共和国的公报提出，在目前两个德国存在的条件下，对德和约可由两个德国来签署；在消除西柏林占领状态的问题上，苏联愿意与美、英、法一道共同保障西柏林自由城市的地位，保证西柏林的内政不受干涉，并同意由联合国来保证。如西方国家真正愿意进行谈判，苏联可以适当地推迟从西德到西柏林的交通线管理权的移交期限。
    苏联的建议深得人心。在世界舆论的压力下，西方国家不得不从一开始完全拒绝苏联的缓和欧洲紧张局势的建议到同意坐下来谈判苏联的建议。3月26日，西方国家复照苏联，同意于5月11日在日内瓦举行东西方外长会议，讨论包括对德和约和西柏林问题在内的德国问题。
