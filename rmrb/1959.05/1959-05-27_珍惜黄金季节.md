    Cherish the Golden Season
    Today we are publishing several news items about summer harvesting and planting, field management, summer grain procurement and transportation from various localities. The purpose is to illustrate that summer is a golden season, and also a particularly busy and intense season for agricultural work. Many tasks are concentrated in a short period of time. This requires us, like ZaoYang County in Hubei Province, to consider and comprehensively arrange the current tasks in a unified manner. For example, scheduling time, allocating labor, adjusting tools, assigning cadres, organizing transportation, etc., must be prioritized according to their importance and urgency, one step at a time, from start to finish, to properly arrange this series of tasks.
    Here, seizing the opportunity is extremely important. Especially during the busy season of summer harvesting and planting, missing one day of farm work will cause a day's loss. Therefore, we must cherish time as we cherish gold. What can be done today should not be delayed until tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Tasks that must be completed in the first half of the month should not be postponed to the second half of the month. Time and tide wait for no man. With the concept of cherishing the opportune moment, we will value the arrangement of these tasks, and we will be able to do these tasks in a tense but orderly manner.

    珍惜黄金季节
    今天我们发表几个地方夏收夏种、田间管理、夏粮征购和调运的新闻，目的是想说明：夏季是个黄金季节，又是个农事特别繁忙、工作特别紧张的季节，许多事情挤在一起，时间又短促。这就要求我们像湖北枣阳县那样，统一考虑和全面安排当前各项工作。例如安排时间、调配劳力、调整工具、配备干部、组织运输力量，等等，必须分别轻重先后，一环扣一环，从头到尾，妥善布置这一系列工作。
    这里，抓时机是极端重要的。尤其是夏收夏种繁忙的季节，错过一天的农活，就会造成一天的损失，因此，必须像爱黄金一样爱惜时间。今天能干完的事，不要拖到明天后天，上半月必须完成的任务，不能挪到下半月去完成。时不再来，机不可失。有了珍惜时机的观念，我们才会重视去安排这些工作，才会紧张地然而有条不紊地作好这些工作。
