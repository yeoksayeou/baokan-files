Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Central Flood Control Headquarters held a telephone conference on the evening of the 16th to inspect and urge various regions to conscientiously carry out flood prevention preparations.

    Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Central Flood Control Headquarters, pointed out in his speech: The South has now entered the flood season, and the North will soon enter the flood season as well. In order to overcome this year's floods, flood prevention preparations are now imminent. He requested that Party and government organs at all levels, relevant departments, and flood control command organizations at all levels immediately take action. In addition to carefully inspecting and making necessary reinforcements to various projects, it is also necessary to earnestly mobilize the masses, strengthen ideological leadership, improve and strengthen flood control organizations, organize flood control teams, fully prepare flood control materials, organize regional cooperation, and do a good job in hydrological forecasting.

    According to reports at the meeting, flood control command organizations have been successively established in various provinces, and inspections of water conservancy projects and river dikes are underway. Most regions are stepping up annual dike maintenance and are seizing the time to prepare materials and supplies for flood prevention. Among them, Zhejiang has established flood control organizations in four special districts and fifty-one counties. Guangdong has held flood prevention meetings in four special districts, and flood prevention exercises have also been held on the North River dike. Half of the Yellow River's annual maintenance has been completed. Shandong Province has discovered more than 1,000 hidden dangers on the Yellow River dikes and is stepping up repairs.

    Various regions are also paying close attention to the flood prevention work of newly built water conservancy projects. Hubei Province has proposed that reservoir projects must first ensure safety and then ensure benefits. Baoding Special District in Hebei Province is training water conservancy project management personnel in the People's Communes.

    According to the inspection, there are still many special districts and counties in various regions whose flood control organizations have not been established quickly, and flood prevention preparations, especially flood prevention materials, have not yet been implemented. The meeting therefore requested that various regions strengthen ideological education on flood prevention, overcome the complacency of the masses and cadres, especially among cadres, and quickly implement flood prevention preparations to the end.

    The meeting pointed out that flood prevention organizations must go deep into production teams, and flood prevention technology must be handed over to the masses. This year, all small and medium-sized water conservancy projects are required to have hydrological forecasts, and various regions must do a good job in mass hydrological forecasting. The important task at present is to seize the time to inspect and reinforce various projects and step up the preparation of flood prevention materials.

    组织要深入生产队　技术要交给群众
    今年防汛准备必须落实到底
    中央防汛总指挥部召开电话会议进行检查督促
    新华社18日讯　中央防汛总指挥部16日晚召开电话会议，检查并督促各地认真作好防汛准备工作。
    国务院副总理、中央防汛总指挥部主任邓子恢在讲话中指出：目前南方已进入汛期，北方也将很快进入汛期。为战胜今年的洪水，防汛准备工作已刻不容缓，他要求各级党政机关、各有关部门、各级防汛指挥机构，立即行动起来，除对各项工程进行仔细检查和必要的加固工作外，还必须认真发动群众，加强思想领导，健全和充实防汛机构，组织好防汛队伍，充分准备防汛器材，组织好地区协作和作好水情预报等方面的工作。
    根据会上的汇报，现在各省防汛指挥机构都已陆续建立，对水利工程和江河堤防正在进行检查，大多数地方正加紧堤防岁修，抓紧准备防汛用的器材和物料。其中，浙江已有四个专区、五十一个县成立了防汛机构。广东已有四个专区开过防汛会议，北江堤上还举行了防汛的演习。黄河岁修已完成一半。山东省在黄河河堤上发现了一千多处隐患，正在加紧修补。
    各地对新修水利工程的防汛工作也很注意。湖北省提出水库工程先要确保安全，然后确保受益。河北省保定专区正在训练人民公社的水利工程管理人员。
    根据检查，各地还有很多专区、县的防汛机构没有迅速成立起来，防汛准备工作特别是防汛器材还未落实。会议为此要求各地加强防汛的思想教育工作，克服群众和干部特别是干部中存在的麻痹大意思想，迅速把防汛准备工作落实到底。
    会议指出：防汛组织必须深入到生产队，防汛的技术一定要交给群众。今年要求中小型水利工程都要有水文预报，各地必须作好群众性的水文预报工作。目前的重要工作是抓紧对各项工程进行检查和加固，加紧防汛物料的准备。
