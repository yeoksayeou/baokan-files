Fellow Representatives:

    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I would now like to offer some suggestions on the issue of improving the quality of teaching in universities and colleges.

    1958 was a year of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the deepening of the cultural and technological revolutions, higher education has not only experienced a leap in quantity but also a significant improvement in quality.

    Like Nanjing University and other brother universities, under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward and under the guidance of the Party's education policy, all aspects of the school's work have achieved great results over the past year. The main task now is to consolidate and improve the achievements already made and further improve the quality of teaching.

    Three Fundamental Achievements Were Made After Implementing the Party's Education Policy

    Implementing the Party's education policy of "education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor" is a great revolution in Chinese education, and it must go through long-term, complex practical work and ideological struggle. When the Party's education policy was first announced, some people were skeptical and waited to see, while others argued against it, proposing that "the separation of mental and manual labor is a reasonable social division of labor" and that "the infiltration of labor into teaching will inevitably reduce the quality of teaching." After repeated debates, especially after nearly a year of practical work, the opponents were silenced in the face of the facts, and some people who held skeptical and wait-and-see attitudes also began to change and join the ranks of the education revolution. At present, the vast majority of people support the Party's education policy, and it has become the mainstream.

    The above-mentioned transformation of ideological understanding is not accidental; it is determined by two factors: one is the development of people's ability to reflect, and the other is the degree to which objective things are exposed. Therefore, when talking about the transformation of people's ideological understanding, we cannot but briefly outline the tremendous achievements our school has made in implementing the Party's education policy over the past year.

    The fundamental achievements can be summarized in three points: the establishment and strengthening of the Party's leadership, the inclusion of productive labor in the education plan, and the successful adoption of the mass line method in teaching. Here, I will only briefly introduce a series of new changes brought about by the combination of education and labor in education work.

    Combining Education and Productive Labor Promotes Ideological Transformation of Teachers and Students, Promotes Teaching, Corrects the Direction of Scientific Research, and Creates Valuable Wealth

    Combining education and productive labor has promoted the ideological transformation of the vast number of teachers and students. After nearly a year of productive practice and labor training, the school has begun to change the past bourgeois ideological style of being fond of ease and aversion to labor, being undisciplined and lax, and despising workers and peasants. What has emerged is a new type of person with a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, a communist labor attitude that does not count time or conditions, and a communist spirit of cooperation of "I for everyone, everyone for me." This rapid growth of socialist and communist ideology is the main driving force for doing a good job in teaching.

    Combining education and productive labor has promoted the improvement of teaching and the improvement of teaching quality. Practice is the source of knowledge and the foundation of theory. In the practice of productive labor, students not only increase their perceptual knowledge but also supplement and deepen the deficiencies in book knowledge, creating the necessary conditions for further understanding, mastering, and applying scientific theories. In the past, some college students, after finishing zoology and botany, could not distinguish between buffaloes and cattle, barley and wheat; some, although they answered physics and geology test questions very well, could not combine them with production to find mineral deposits. Now, this deformed situation has been fundamentally changed. Students not only have a high level of theoretical knowledge but also have a certain amount of practical experience. This comprehensive development of education quality meets the state's requirements for training construction talents.

    Combining education and productive labor has corrected the direction of scientific research in universities and colleges. In the past, scientific research was only a matter for a few people. Many people believed that studying production problems was "unpromising," and the further away the research topic was from production and practice, the more it was praised as "amazing" and "talented." Now, scientific research has become a mass activity for the vast number of teachers and students, and research topics have focused on combining current needs with the long-term interests of the country. In one year, because 54% of the students and 82% of the young teachers participated in research work, not only did the cold and desolate situation in scientific research change, but also many exciting research results were obtained. The number of topics completed last year far exceeded the total number of projects completed by our school in the eight years since liberation. This is very beneficial for developing production and improving theoretical teaching.

    Combining education and productive labor has also created valuable wealth for the country and made beneficial contributions to the development of socialist construction. In the second half of last year, in field work, teachers and students of the Department of Geology found more than 40 kinds of minerals and more than 500 mineral locations for the country. The reserves of major minerals alone reached more than 8.7 billion tons; and nearly 20,000 square kilometers of geological mapping was completed, and 612 geological personnel were trained. Teachers and students of the Department of Geography completed 120,000 mu of farmland surveying, 120 kilometers of river and channel surveying, and 650,000 square kilometers of geomorphological and natural geographical surveys. Teachers and students of other departments have produced certain products in productive labor, including some cutting-edge products. These have practical significance for promoting the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    Of course, our work still has many shortcomings. These shortcomings are shortcomings in progress. As long as we dare to face up to shortcomings and correct them, we will continue to move forward.

    Several Arrangements for Implementing the Education Policy in the Future

    In order to further implement the Party's education policy and adapt to the ever-leaping national situation, this semester, we have comprehensively summarized the work of the past year, and according to the instructions of higher authorities and the specific situation of our school, we have carefully studied and arranged the following tasks:

    First, we have strengthened the teaching of political courses and basic theory courses, and paid attention to systematic specialization training. Strengthening the teaching of political courses and basic theory courses is the foundation for cultivating both red and expert cadres. Last year, the characteristic of political courses was to closely integrate with the rectification movement, and significant achievements were made in cooperating with the national Great Leap Forward situation and transforming the thinking of all teachers, students, and staff. The shortcoming was that systematic political theory education was insufficient. This year, the political course teaching in our school has adopted a two-pronged approach. We have opened two political courses, one is Socialism and Communism, and the other is Marxist Philosophy. In the spirit of the secretary taking the lead and the whole party participating, the lecturers are mainly full-time political teachers, and responsible comrades from the provincial and municipal party committees, school principals, party committee members, and general branch secretaries are also invited to teach political courses. In terms of teaching time, political courses have increased from about 10% of the total study hours in the past to 15% to 20%. In terms of teaching methods, on the one hand, theory is systematically taught, and on the other hand, practical problems are solved in light of the current situation, so political and ideological education has been greatly strengthened.

    While strengthening the teaching of political courses, we have also strengthened the teaching of basic theory courses and professional theory courses. The first is to correctly understand the important significance of the principle of "theory linked with practice" in teaching. Whether basic theory courses can be combined with production and linked with practice is a matter of debate in our school. Some people emphasize the systematicness and logicality of theory and deny the necessity and possibility of combining with production and practice; others mechanically view the relationship between theory and practice, advocating that everything should start from practice and that practical knowledge should be mastered first and then summarized as theoretical knowledge. These are two different manifestations of the separation of theory and practice. We have criticized these one-sided understandings and some tendencies to weaken basic theory courses, insisted on the systematic teaching of basic theory courses, and at the same time paid attention to closely combining them with production practice, thereby improving the quality of basic courses and professional courses. Secondly, the content of basic theory courses and professional theory courses has been adjusted. In the past, because teachers emphasized the systematicness of their own courses, they often ignored the connection between theory and practice and the mutual affiliation between courses, which invisibly increased the difficulty and burden of students' learning. This semester, we have made necessary adjustments to the content of each course, not only paying attention to the sequential arrangement and the proportion of study hours of each course, but also paying attention to their internal connection, removing some unnecessary repetitions, adding mutual explanatory materials, reducing overly outdated content, and adding the latest scientific achievements. This has created favorable conditions for students' learning. Finally, the proportion of study hours for basic courses and professional courses has been increased. In the previous teaching plan, the study hours for basic courses and professional courses only accounted for 40% to 60% of the total study hours. After adjustment, they have been increased to 50% to 65% of the total study hours. This increase is appropriate. Without a relatively deep theoretical foundation, the knowledge scope of the talents trained will be too narrow. Within the prescribed study hours, we emphasize the systematic teaching of theory and arrange experiments and production internships in a planned way. We believe that productive labor can replace part of experiments and production internships, but it cannot completely replace them.

    Political courses have been strengthened, and the study hours for basic courses and professional courses have been increased, so the study hours for specialized courses will inevitably be reduced accordingly. However, this does not mean that the time for specialization should be arbitrarily reduced. On the contrary, the study hours for specialized courses must be appropriately adjusted according to different majors. Since the beginning of this semester, various departments have added a number of specialized courses that reflect the latest scientific achievements and political ideological struggles, so that students have both a broad foundation of theoretical knowledge and certain specialized skills. This is conducive to cultivating them into socialist construction talents with independent working ability.

    Second, comprehensive arrangements have been made for teaching, productive labor, and scientific research work. Comprehensive arrangements are necessary because teaching has new content—productive labor—since the implementation of the Party's education policy. At present, although productive labor and scientific research have been included in the education plan, their position is still very unstable. If not handled well, there is still a risk of them being squeezed out or squeezing out teaching. In the arrangement, we cannot only be satisfied with the amount of time they occupy; more important is their organic combination; we must not only pay attention to today's arrangement but also pay attention to tomorrow's arrangement. This requires paying attention to the fact that education combined with productive labor, and productive labor enriches and deepens the content of education; teaching drives scientific research, and the development of scientific research promotes the improvement of teaching quality. This is a meticulous arrangement process and also an arduous practice process. To go deep into teaching work and further improve teaching quality, we must start here and gradually find new teaching laws.

    The task of teaching is to impart and learn knowledge, so the time for classroom teaching must be guaranteed. We believe that the teaching time for general departments should be about eight months a year, and the teaching time for majors with more production internships (such as geography and geology) should not be less than seven months a year. New teaching materials should be built up actively and steadily. New teaching methods should also be tested in a focused manner. There should be a certain ratio between classroom teaching time and students' self-study time. In short, it is necessary to combine lecturing and self-study, combine independent thinking and collective discussion, and combine comprehensive development and teaching students according to their aptitude.

    Combining labor with profession is an important measure to improve teaching quality. Since last year, we have established 17 small factories and 1 comprehensive experimental farm in conjunction with our majors, which is very beneficial for arranging teaching and scientific research. However, it is not enough to limit ourselves here. We also need to organize teachers and students to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor in rural areas and factories in a planned way, and participate in social public welfare labor regularly to enrich production knowledge and cultivate feelings for workers and peasants from labor. We believe that the important significance of labor is to transform people's thinking and use this as a driving force to improve the quality of education.

    Scientific research work should be combined with teaching and productive labor, and at the same time, we should focus on cutting-edge research. We should pay attention to the research of current practical problems and also pay attention to the research of basic theoretical problems. Research work should be mainly carried out by teachers, with senior students participating more and junior students participating to a limited extent. The selection of scientific research topics should be combined with national tasks as much as possible, but the important thing is to combine with teaching and use the results of scientific research to continuously enrich the content of teaching.

    While focusing on teaching and labor, we must also focus on life. We stipulate that students study for nine hours a day (including self-study), sleep for eight hours, have three hours of party and league activities per week, and three to five hours of physical exercise and military training. The rest of the time is freely allocated by students, and we try our best to improve students' lives and the school's teaching environment to create the necessary conditions for the teaching, learning, labor, and rest of all teachers, students, and staff.

    All these arrangements are for the continued progress of higher education, for further implementing the Party's education policy. It is a positive measure and has nothing in common with some negative views.

    Third, establish democratic and united teacher-student relations, and further exert the leading role of teachers in teaching. Last year, our school implemented the mass line method of combining teachers and students under the leadership of the Party committee, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of teachers and students. We have achieved significant results in all aspects of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. However, even now, some people do not recognize the possibility and necessity of taking the mass line in education; and some people do not have sufficient understanding of the leading role of teachers in the teaching process. These one-sided understandings are very unfavorable to going deep into teaching work. Facts have proved that only by letting teachers and the vast number of young students combine can they better exert their leading role in teaching; at the same time, only under the leadership of the Party committee and the guidance of teachers can the enthusiasm and creativity of young students be more fully developed. The important issue in improving teacher-student relations is to strengthen ideological and political education, continuously improve the level of Marxism-Leninism thinking of the vast number of teachers and students, and at the same time carefully summarize the work of the previous period, study the practical problems existing in teaching work, and solve them realistically through democratic discussion. At present, a new teacher-student relationship of sincere cooperation, mutual teaching and learning, respecting teachers and loving students, and democratic unity has emerged in our school, as well as a democratic and active academic discussion atmosphere of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. This has laid an extremely favorable ideological and working foundation for further implementing the Party's education policy.

    Democratic and united teacher-student relations are not only conducive to doing a good job in current teaching work but also conducive to promoting "intellectualizing workers" and "making peasants knowledgeable." With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, national construction needs a large number of socialist construction talents who have both socialist consciousness and modern knowledge. Universities and colleges are important fronts for cultivating such construction talents. How to effectively transform old intellectuals and cultivate new intellectuals so that they can grow up rapidly to meet the needs of national socialist construction is an urgent task for universities and colleges. To accomplish this task, the important issue at present lies in vigorously training and improving the political and professional levels of young and old teachers. If their political and professional levels are improved, they will be able to competently and happily do a good job in teaching under the leadership of the Party committee and better exert their leading role in teaching. We believe that cultivating a contingent of teachers who are both red and expert is an important link in consolidating the Party's leadership, continuously improving the quality of teaching, and gradually eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor. The school party committee must regard it as its own important task.

    Fellow Representatives, the education cause is an important part of the entire socialist construction cause. The victory we have achieved in higher education work over the past year is the victory of the general line of socialist construction and the great victory of the Party's education policy. The continuous leap forward in socialist construction has put forward higher requirements for higher education work. We firmly believe that as long as we follow the instructions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, combine soaring revolutionary enthusiasm with a realistic and scientific spirit, and resolutely advance along the road pointed out by the Party's education policy, our work will surely achieve greater, better, and more comprehensive victories.

    Fellow Representatives: 1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in China's socialist construction. With the ideological foundation of the rectification movement and the work experience of the past year, higher education will surely achieve greater development and improvement under the new situation. All teachers, students, and staff of Nanjing University are delighted and encouraged by the grand national construction plan of the Great Leap Forward; and they have deep feelings for the southwestern border of our great motherland and the hardworking and brave Tibetan people. We will support national construction and support the Tibetan people in completely putting down the rebellion and gradually realizing social reform and socialist construction with our own efforts and achievements in teaching and scientific research. We warn a small handful of expansionist elements in India that you should learn some history and not go to the arsenal of British imperialism to find weapons to deal with Tibet in China. You know, the Chinese people have long been familiar with the tricks of British imperialism in invading China. If you do not recognize the times and vainly attempt to collude to engage in some activities that interfere in China's internal affairs, the Chinese people who have stood up will surely give you a sufficient amount of counterattack. We also hope that higher education workers, scientific workers, and college students in India cherish the traditional friendship of Sino-Indian cultural exchanges and condemn with just public opinion those expansionist elements who undermine Sino-Indian friendship, so that they can be sober and not get like what a Chinese idiom says: "Trying to steal a chicken only to lose the bait."

专栏：

    做好全面安排，进一步提高教学质量
    郭影秋代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。现在仅就高等学校提高教学质量的问题，提出一点意见。
    一九五八年是我国社会主义建设全面大跃进的一年。随着工农业生产的大跃进，随着文化革命和技术革命的深入开展，高等教育事业，不仅在数量上有了飞跃的发展，同时在质量方面也有显著的提高。
    南京大学和其他兄弟高等学校一样，在大跃进形势的推动下，在党的教育方针的指引下，一年来，学校工作的各个方面都获得了很大成绩。当前的主要问题是巩固、提高既得成绩，进一步提高教学质量。
    贯彻执行党的教育方针后取得了三点带有根本性的成绩
    贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针，是中国教育的大革命，必须经过长期、复杂的工作实践和思想斗争。当党的教育方针公布之初，有些人在怀疑、观望，还有人提出：“劳心与劳力分离是合理的社会分工”，“劳动渗入教学必然会降低教学质量”等等论调来反对它。经过反复辩论，特别是经过近一年来的工作实践，反对论者才在事实面前哑口无言，一些抱有怀疑、观望态度的人，也开始转变过来投入教育革命的行列。目前，拥护党的教育方针的人已经占了绝大多数，成为主流。
    上述思想认识的转变不是偶然的，它决定于两种因素：一是人的反映能力的发展，再是客观事物暴露的程度。所以，当谈到人们思想认识转变的时候，不能不概述一下我校一年来在贯彻执行党的教育方针方面所取得的巨大成绩。
    带有根本性的成绩可以概括为三点，那就是：确立和加强了党的领导，生产劳动列入了教育计划，教学工作中成功地采用了群众路线的方法。在这里，我只简单介绍一下由于教育与劳动结合在教育工作中所引起的一系列的新的变化。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，促进了师生的思想改造，推动了教学工作，端正了科学研究方向，创造了宝贵财富
    教育与生产劳动相结合，促进了广大师生的思想改造。经过近一年的生产实践与劳动锻炼，学校中，开始改变了过去好逸恶劳、自由散漫、轻视工农群众的资产阶级思想作风，不断涌现出来的是具有敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，不计时间、不计条件的共产主义劳动态度，和我为人人、人人为我的共产主义协作精神的新型人物。这种社会主义、共产主义思想的迅速成长，是搞好教学工作的主要动力。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，推动了教学工作的改进和教学质量的提高。实践是知识的源泉和理论的基础，学生在生产劳动的实践中，不仅增加了感性知识，而且还补充和加深了书本知识之不足，为进一步领会和掌握、运用科学理论创造了必要条件。在过去，有的大学生读完动物学、植物学，还分不清水牛与黄牛，大麦与小麦；有的对物理学、地质学的试题尽管答得很好，但是他们并不会结合生产，寻找矿藏。现在，这种畸形的情况已有了根本的改变，学生不仅具有了较高的理论知识，而且也具有一定的实践经验。这种全面发展的教育质量，符合国家培养建设人材的要求。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，端正了高等学校中科学研究的方向。在过去，科学研究工作只是少数人的事情，不少人认为研究生产问题是
  “没有出息”，研究题目离开生产和实际越远，就越被誉为“了不起”，“有才能”。现在，科学研究工作已成为广大师生群众性的活动，研究选题已注意把当前需要和国家长远利益结合起来。一年间，由于有百分之五十四的学生和百分之八十二的青年教师参加了研究工作，不只改变了科学研究工作中冷冷清清的局面，而且也获得了许多令人兴奋的研究成果。去年一年完成的题目远远超过解放八年来我校完成项目的总和。对于发展生产和提高理论教学，都有很大好处。
    教育与生产劳动相结合，也为国家创造了宝贵财富，对社会主义建设事业的发展作出有益贡献。去年下半年，我校在野外工作中，地质系的师生为国家找到了矿物四十余种，矿点五百余处，仅主要矿藏的储量就达到八十七亿吨以上；并完成了地质填图近二万平方公里，培养地质人员六百一十二人。地理系师生完成了农田测量十二万亩，河渠道测量一百二十公里，地貌、自然地理调查六十五万平方公里。其他各系的师生在生产劳动中都生产了一定产品，其中包括一些尖端性的产品。这些，对于促进工农业生产的继续跃进，具有现实的意义。
    当然，我们的工作也还有很多缺点。这些缺点是前进中的缺点。只要敢于正视缺点，改正缺点，就会不断前进。
    今后贯彻教育方针的几项安排
    为了进一步贯彻党的教育方针，以适应不断跃进的全国形势，本学期，我们全面地总结了去年一年的工作，并根据上级指示和我校具体情况，细致地研究和安排了下列几项工作：
    第一、加强了政治课和基础理论课的教学，注意了系统的专门化训练。加强政治课和基础理论课的教学，是培养红专干部的根基。去年一年，政治课的特点是密切结合整风运动，在配合全国大跃进的形势、改造全校师生员工的思想等方面，取得了显著的成绩。其缺点是系统的政治理论教育不够。今年，我校的政治课教学采取了两条腿走路的方法，我们开设了两门政治课，一门是社会主义和共产主义，一门是马克思主义哲学。本着书记挂帅，全党动手的精神，讲课的人以专职的政治教员为主，同时并聘请省市委的负责同志、学校校长、党委委员、总支书记等分别担任政治课的讲授。在教学时间方面，政治课从过去占总学时的百分之十左右增加为百分之十五至百分之二十。在教学方法上，一方面系统的讲授理论，另方面又联系当前实际解决思想问题，政治思想教育因而大大加强。
    在加强政治课教学的同时，我们也加强了基础理论课与专业理论课的教学。首先是正确理解“理论联系实际”这个原则在教学中的重要意义。基础理论课能否结合生产，联系实际，在我校是有争论的。有人强调理论的系统性，逻辑性，否认结合生产、实际的必要性与可能性；有人则机械地看待理论与实际的关系，主张一切从实践入手，事事都要先掌握了实践知识然后再总结为理论知识。这是理论与实际脱节的两种不同的表现形式。我们批判了这些片面的认识和某些削弱基础理论课的倾向，坚持了基础理论课的系统讲授，同时又注意把它跟生产实际紧密地结合起来，从而提高了基础课、专业课教学的质量。其次，调整了基础理论课与专业理论课的内容：过去，由于教师强调本门课程的系统性，往往忽略理论跟实际的联系以及各门课程之间的相互联属，无形中增加了学生学习的困难和负担。本学期，我们对各门课程的内容作了必要的调整，不只注意了各门课程的先后安排与学时比重，而且还注意了它们之间的内在联系，去掉了某些不必要的重复，增加了相互阐述的资料，削减了过分陈旧的内容，增添了最新科学的成就。从而为学生的学习创造了有利的条件。最后增加基础课的专业课的学时比重。在以前的教学计划中，基础课和专业课的学时只占总学时的百分之四十至百分之六十，经过调整，增加为占总学时的百分之五十至百分之六十五。这样增加是合适的，没有较为深厚的理论基础，培养出来的人材其知识面将过于狭窄。在规定的学时以内，强调系统理论的讲授，并有计划地安排实验与生产实习。我们认为生产劳动能代替一部分实验与生产实习，但不能完全代替。
    政治课加强了，基础课与专业课的学时增加了，专门化课程的学时势必相应减少。但是，这并不是说要任意地减少专门化的时间，相反，必须根据不同专业对专门化课程的学时加以适当调整。本学期来，各系都增设了若干反映最新科学成就和政治思想斗争的专门化课程，使得学生既有较广阔的基础理论知识，又具有一定的专门特长，这样，有利于把他们培养成为有独立工作能力的社会主义建设人材。
    第二、对教学、生产劳动、科学研究工作做了全面的安排　全面安排之所以有必要，是因为贯彻执行党的教育方针以来，教学有了新的内容——生产劳动。目前，生产劳动和科学研究虽已列入了教育计划，但是，它们的地位还很不稳固，处理不善，还有被挤掉或者挤掉教学的危险。在安排中，不能只满足于它们所占时间的多少，更重要的还是它们之间的有机结合；不只要注意到今天的安排，而且还要注意到明天的安排。这就要注意到：教育结合生产劳动，生产劳动又丰富、加深教育的内容；教学带动科学研究，科学研究的开展又推动着教学质量的提高。这是一个细致的安排过程，也是一个艰苦的实践过程。要深入教学工作，进一步提高教学质量，必须从这里开始，逐步摸到新的教学规律。
    教学的任务在于传授和学习知识，因之，课堂教学的时间必须得到保证。我们认为一般系科的教学时间，全年以八个月左右为宜，生产实习较多的专业（如地理、地质），全年的教学时间也不能少于七个月。新的教材要积极稳步地建设起来。新的教学方法还应有重点地进行试验。课堂讲授时间与学生自习时间应有一定的比例。总之要做到讲授与自学相结合，独立思考与集体讨论相结合，全面发展与因材施教相结合。
    劳动与专业相结合，是提高教学质量的重要措施。去年以来，我们结合专业自办小型工厂十七所，综合性试验农场一所，对于安排教学与科学研究有很大好处。但是局限在这里也还不够，还需要组织师生有计划地下乡下厂参加工农业生产劳动，定期地参加社会公益劳动，从劳动中丰富生产知识，培养工农感情。我们认为劳动的重要意义是改造人的思想，以此为动力来提高教育质量。
    科学研究工作，结合教学与生产劳动进行，同时还要抓尖端，既要注意当前实际问题的研究，也要注意基础理论问题的研究。研究工作以教师为主，高年级的学生多参加，低年级的学生有限度的参加。科学研究选题应该尽可能的结合国家任务，但是重要的是要结合教学，并用科学研究的成果不断丰富教学的内容。
    抓教学抓劳动同时还要抓生活。我们规定学生每日学习九小时（包括自习），睡眠八小时，每周有三小时的党团活动，三至五小时的体育锻炼与军事训练，其余时间均由学生自由支配，并尽可能的改善学生生活与学校的教学环境，为全校师生员工的教学、学习、劳动、休息创造必要的条件。
    这一切安排，都是为了高等教育工作的继续前进，为了进一步贯彻党的教育方针，它是一种积极的措施，和某些消极的看法毫无共同之点。
    第三、建立民主团结的师生关系，进一步发挥教师在教学中的主导作用　去年，我校贯彻执行了在党委领导下教师与学生相结合的群众路线的方法，充分发挥了广大教师、学生的积极性、创造性，在教学、生产劳动和科学研究等各个方面，获得了重大的成绩。但是，至今还有一些人，并不认识教育工作走群众路线的可能性和必要性；也还有一些人，对教师在教学过程中的主导作用认识不足。这些片面性的认识，对于深入教学工作甚为不利。事实证明，只有让教师与广大青年学生结合起来，才能更好的发挥他们在教学中的主导作用；同时，也只有在党委的领导、教师的指导下青年学生的积极性、创造性才能得到更充分的发挥。搞好师生关系的重要问题是加强思想政治教育、不断提高广大师生的马列主义思想水平，同时还要细致地总结前一时期的工作，研究教学工作中存在的实际问题，经过民主讨论，实事求是的加以解决。目前，我校已经出现了一种推诚协作、教学相长、尊师爱生、民主团结的新的师生关系，和百花齐放、百家争鸣的民主活跃的学术讨论气氛，为进一步贯彻党的教育方针，打下了极为有利的思想基础和工作基础。
    民主团结的师生关系，不只有利于做好当前的教学工作，而且有利于促进“知识分子劳动化”和“工农群众知识化”。随着工农业生产的大跃进，国家建设事业需要大量的既有社会主义觉悟又有现代知识的社会主义建设人材。高等学校是培养这种建设人材的重要阵地，如何有效的改造旧知识分子，培养新知识分子，使他们迅速的成长起来，以适应国家社会主义建设的需要，这是高等学校的迫切任务。要完成这个任务，当前的重要问题又在于大力培养、提高青老教师的政治水平和业务水平，他们的政治、业务水平提高了，就能够在党委的领导下胜任愉快地做好教学工作，更好地发挥在教学中的主导作用。我们认为，培养出一支又红又专的教师队伍，是巩固党的领导，不断提高教学质量，逐步消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别的重要环节，学校党委必须把它作为自身的重要任务。
    各位代表，教育事业是整个社会主义建设事业的重要组成部分，一年来，我们在高等教育工作中所取得的胜利，是社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是党的教育方针的伟大胜利。社会主义建设的不断跃进，向高等教育工作提出了更高的要求，我们坚信：只要遵循着党的八届六中全会的指示，把冲天的革命干劲和实事求是的科学精神结合起来，坚决地沿着党的教育方针所指引的道路前进，我们的工作一定会取得更大更好更全面的胜利。
    各位代表：一九五九年，是我国社会主义建设更大更好更全面地跃进的一年。高等教育事业，有了整风运动的思想基础，有了去年一年的工作经验，在新的形势下，必将得到更大的发展与提高。南京大学的全体师生员工，对于宏伟的跃进的国家建设计划，感到欢欣鼓舞；对于伟大祖国的西南边疆及勤劳勇敢的西藏人民，怀着深厚的感情。我们将以自身的努力与教学、科学研究中的成就，支持国家建设，支援西藏人民彻底平息叛乱并逐步实现社会改革和社会主义建设。我们警告印度的一小撮扩张主义分子，你们应当学点历史，不要到英帝国主义侵略印度的武库中去寻找对付中国西藏的武器。你们知道，英帝国主义侵略中国的一套伎俩，中国人民老早就领教过了，如果你们不认清时代，妄想勾结起来，再来干些干涉中国内政的勾当，站起来了的中国人民必将给予你们以足够分量的回击。我们也希望印度的高等教育工作者、科学工作者以及大学生们，珍视中印文化交流的传统友谊，用正义的舆论谴责那些破坏中印友谊的扩张主义分子，要他们清醒一些，不要弄得像中国的一句成语所说的：“偷鸡不着反蚀一把米”。
