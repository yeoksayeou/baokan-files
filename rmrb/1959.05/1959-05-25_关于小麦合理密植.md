This year, the seeding rate of winter wheat in the fields of northern provinces has increased by about double compared to last year. Generally, the seeding rate is between 25 and 35 catties per mu in the fields, and between 30 and 40 catties per mu in high-yield plots. Combined with improved fertilizer and water conditions and cultivation management, the number of ears per mu has also increased significantly compared to last year. Generally, there are about 300,000 to 400,000 ears in the fields, and more than 400,000 to 500,000 ears in high-yield plots. The number of grains per ear has also increased compared to previous years, and a bumper harvest is expected.

In Yanshi County, Henan Province, the wheat ears in the 10,000-mu high-yield plot are neat, uniform, and dense. According to the county's inspection results, based on a seeding rate of 30 to 40 catties, and after a series of meticulous processing and cultivation, there are currently 400,000 to 600,000 ears per mu, averaging about 480,000 ears, with about 25 grains per ear. Although there was a major wind and rain in early May, only some wheat fields experienced lodging, and the lodged wheat still has the possibility of recovery, with little impact on yield. In the high-yield fields around Beijing and Tianjin, the seeding rate has been increased to more than 40 catties per mu, and currently 800,000 to 1,100,000 larger ears have emerged, making it highly likely to achieve high yields.

This year, there are many small-area experimental fields where, due to lack of experience, the seeding rate was too high, and the seedlings grew too densely in the seedling stage. After timely remedial measures such as thinning and leaf pruning, it is still possible to obtain relatively high yields.

Based on these facts, it can be seen that the density of wheat fields this year is within a reasonable range. With good coordination of water and fertilizer conditions and cultivation management, close planting has played a significant role in increasing production.

**Considering the Density Range Based on Late-Stage Growth**

Based on the current growth of wheat fields in various regions and the results of investigation and research, a seeding rate of 20 to 40 catties of seeds per mu, ensuring 250,000 to 600,000 basic seedlings, and striving for 300,000 to 800,000 larger ears is a relatively reasonable close planting range for winter wheat areas in the North. Within this range, various regions should further determine the specific planting density based on different conditions. First, the climatic characteristics of different regions must be considered. For example, the temperature and humidity in the South are higher in winter and spring, and wheat seedlings grow and develop faster, while the opposite is true in the North. Therefore, from South to North, the planting density can be gradually increased appropriately. Secondly, the differences in terrain, soil quality, cultivation, and other conditions in the same area must also be considered. For example: plains, hills, and mountains, paddy fields and dry lands, fallow and stubble rotations, early and late planting, etc., all have different fertilizer and water conditions. Generally speaking, the density should be higher in areas with better conditions and lower in areas with poorer conditions; the density should be higher in cold regions and lower in plains; the density should be higher for late planting and lower for early planting; the density should be higher for poor soil preparation and lower for good soil preparation. In short, it should be specifically determined according to the characteristics of each wheat field. In addition, different varieties have different tillering abilities and seed sizes; the germination rate and vigor of seeds also vary, all of which need to be considered when determining the seeding rate.

**Corresponding Planting Methods**

Various regions report that narrow-row drilling is the best planting method for close planting in the fields. The wheat seedlings are distributed more evenly, the density is easier to control, which is conducive to light penetration and convenient field management. A row spacing of between 2.5 and 4 inches is appropriate. Broadcasting has a greater impact on concealment, shallow soil covering, uneven germination, and inconvenient field management; narrow-row cross-sowing results in uneven density and uneven development of wheat seedlings, so it is generally not advisable to adopt. High-yield plots, due to the large seeding rate and good fertilizer and water conditions, generally use wide-strip drilling rather than narrow-row drilling to prevent early closure and affect the firmness of the stems. However, the width should not be too wide, and the row spacing should not be too narrow, about 4 inches each is appropriate. Narrow broadcasting is basically not suitable for close planting in the fields.

**The Relationship Between Individuals and Groups**

Close planting is not the denser the better. Under certain cultivation conditions, there is a certain range for planting density, and it is by no means the denser the better. This year's general increase in wheat production due to the increased number of ears confirms that rational close planting is the main guarantee for increasing the number of effective ears per unit area. However, according to observations from several experimental fields, after the density is too high, the growth and development of individual wheat seedlings are significantly inhibited, resulting in no tillering, weak roots, and thin stems, leading to a large number of dead seedlings in the later stage, severe lodging, and reduced production.

Rational close planting is to rationally arrange the relationship between the growth and development of individuals and groups, to maintain the healthy growth and development of individual plants on the basis of increasing the number of plants, and to ensure that the most and largest ears and large and full grains are obtained in a certain unit area, so as to constitute a high yield per unit area. Therefore, the density must be proportional to the increase in production with the coordination of other conditions. Density that does not increase production is unreasonable close planting, which is not what we need.

**The Relationship Between Main Stems and Tillers**

In order to strive for more and larger ears, should we rely on the main stem ears or the tiller ears? That is, should we increase the number of main stems with a larger seeding rate, or promote full tillering with a smaller seeding rate? The experience of previous years and this year proves that the main stems have a high ear-forming rate, develop quite consistently, mature uniformly, have large ears and grains, and the cultivation technology is relatively easy to master. If the number of basic seedlings is small and the tillering period is excessively prolonged, the ears often vary in size and maturity. Under the current cultivation conditions, tillering begins to die after the jointing stage, especially the late tillers. Therefore, although the number of tillers is large, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient number of ears due to the low ear-forming rate, and the certainty of high yield is very small. This year, after improving fertilizer and water conditions and cultivation management levels, the wheat fields in various regions with appropriate increases in seeding rates generally obtained more and more uniform ears than those with lower seeding rates. According to the results of inspections in the suburbs of Beijing, Xingtai in Hebei, Yanshi in Henan, Suining in Jiangsu, and the suburbs of Nanjing, etc., this year, the number of ears per plant in wheat fields with a seeding rate of 25 to 40 catties is between 1.3 and 1.6, of which one is the main stem ear and 0.3 to 0.6 are tiller ears. In the past, when the seeding rate was lower than this year, the number of tillers per plant was similar to this year. The more tillers there are, the greater the fluctuation range of the effective tillering rate. It is very limited to strive for more tiller ears under field cultivation conditions, and high yield is not reliable. However, tillering is a characteristic of wheat. Under normal growth conditions, seedlings generally grow several tillers, which can promote good root development and strong seedlings; although most tillers gradually die after the jointing stage, in the early stage, these tillers have accumulated organic matter and improved the growth of the main stem through photosynthesis. Striving for early tillering is still for the healthy growth of the main stem. In the case of excessive close planting, the seedlings are crowded and cannot grow early tillers, resulting in weak plant growth, and the goal of high yield is not achieved.

If we want to reliably obtain high yields, relying on the main stem is better than relying on tillers. Therefore, to achieve the yield-increasing effect of rational close planting and achieve the goal of more and larger ears, we must first have a sufficient seeding rate and basic seedling count. At the same time, the basic seedlings must be able to grow a certain number of tillers to make the seedlings strong.

**More Materials Need to be Collected for Analysis and Research**

In order to further exert the yield-increasing effect of rational close planting, the central link of yield-increasing technology, it is also necessary to grasp the last period of the wheat growing season, based on materials from all aspects, and do a good job of analyzing and summarizing local high-yield fields around the following five issues: ① Reasonable density under different regions and different natural conditions; ② The mutual coordination of reasonable density with soil, fertilizer, and water conditions; ③ Suitable planting methods for reasonable density; ④ The relationship between close planting and lodging; ⑤ The relationship between close planting and varieties.

    关于小麦合理密植
    今年北方各省冬小麦的大田播种量较去年提高了一倍左右，一般大田每亩在二十五——三十五斤之间，丰产方在三十——四十斤之间，结合肥水条件和耕作管理水平的提高，每亩穗数也比去年增加了很多。一般大田约有三十——四十万穗，丰产方约有四十——五十万穗以上，每穗粒数也比往年有所增加，丰收有望。
    河南偃师县万亩丰产方麦穗整齐茂密，据县里检查结果，在播种量三十——四十斤的基础上，经过一系列精细加工培植，目前每亩有四十——六十万穗，平均约四十八万穗，每穗约二十五粒，5月上旬虽遭遇过一次大风雨，只有部分麦田发生倒伏现象，倒伏麦仍有恢复可能，影响产量不大。北京、天津一带的丰产田，每亩播种量提高到四十斤以上，目前已抽出八十——一百一十万较大的穗子，获得高额丰产的可能性很大。
    今年有不少小面积试验田，于由经验不足，播种用量过大，苗期生长过密；经过及时采用疏苗剪叶等补救措施之后，仍可能得到相当高的产量。
    根据这些事实可以看出，今年一般麦田的密度是在合理范围之内的。加以水肥条件和耕作管理配合得好，密植对增产发挥了显著的作用。
    从后期生长情况看密植范围
    根据目前各地大田小麦生长情况及调查研究的结果，北方冬麦区的大田以每亩播种二十——四十斤种子，保证二十五——六十万基本麦苗、争取三十——八十万较大穗子为比较合理的密植范围。在这个范围之内，各地还要根据不同条件进一步确定具体播种密度。首先要考虑不同地区的气候特点，如南部冬春气温和湿度较高，麦苗生长发育较快，北部地区相反，因之，由南到北，种植密度可以逐渐适当加大一些。其次，也要考虑到同一地区存在着地形、土质、耕作、栽培等条件的差异。例如：平原、丘陵和山地，水地和旱地，歇茬和回茬，早茬和晚茬等，肥料和水分等条件都不相同。一般地讲，条件好的密度应较大，差的密度应较小；高寒地区密度应较大，平原地区密度应较小；晚播的密度应较大，早播的密度应较小；整地质量差的密度应较大，好的密度应较小。总之，要根据每一块麦田的特点，具体规定。此外，品种不同，分蘖力强弱、种子大小有差别；种子的发芽率和发芽势也有高低，都需要在确定播种量时加以考虑。
    相适应的播种方式
    各地反映：窄行条播是大田密植播种的最好方式，麦苗分布比较均匀，密度容易掌握，有利于透光和便于田间管理。行距以在二寸半——四寸之间为适当。撒播的隐蔽影响较大，复土较浅，发芽不齐，田间管理也不方便；窄行交叉播种稀密不匀，麦苗发育不齐，所以一般不宜采用。丰产方由于播种量较大，肥水条件较好，为防止早期封垅，影响茎秆坚实，一般以宽幅条播较窄行条播为更好。但幅度不宜过宽，行距不宜太窄，约各以四寸左右为宜。窄播基本不适用于大田密植。
    个体和群体的关系
    密植并不是越密越好。在一定栽培条件下，播种密度是有一定范围的，决不是越密越好。今年小麦普遍由于增加穗数而获得丰产，肯定了合理密植是增加单位面积内有效穗数的主要保证。但是，根据若干试验田的观察结果，在密度过大之后，麦苗单株生长发育受到明显的抑制，出现了无分蘖、根子弱、茎秆细的现象，以致后期大量死苗，严重倒伏减产。
    合理密植就是要合理安排个体和群体间生长发育的关系，要在增加植株数量的基础上保持单株的生长发育健壮，保证在一定单位面积内获得最多最大的穗子、大而饱满的粒子，以构成单位面积上的高额产量。因此，密度必须在其他条件的配合下，和增产成正比例，密到不增产的程度，就是不合理的密植，不是我们所需要的。
    主穗和分蘖的关系
    为了争取穗多穗大，究竟依靠主茎穗、还是依靠分蘖穗呢？也就是用较大的播种量而增加主茎数量，还是用较小的播种量促使充分分蘖呢？往年和今年的经验证明，主茎成穗率高，发育相当一致，成熟整齐，穗大粒大，栽培技术比较容易掌握。如果基本苗数少，分蘖时期过分延长，往往穗子大小和成熟早迟不一。在目前栽培情况下，一过拔节时期，分蘖即开始死亡，特别是后生分蘖死亡很多。因此，分蘖数目虽多，但由于成穗率低，很难得到足够的穗数，高产的把握很小。今年在提高了肥水条件和栽培管理水平之后，各地适当增加播种量的麦田一般都比播种量低的得到较多而比较整齐的穗子。根据今年北京郊区、河北的邢台、河南的偃师、江苏的睢宁、南京郊区等地检查的结果，在播种量二十五至四十斤的麦田内，单株结穗数都在一点三至一点六之间，其中，一个是主茎穗，零点三至零点六个是分蘖穗；以往在播种量比今年少的情况下，单株分蘖数也与今年相似。分蘖越多，有效分蘖率变动幅度越大，在大田栽培情况下争取较多的分蘖穗有很大的局限性，丰产没有依靠。但分蘖是小麦的特性，在正常的生育情况下，苗期一般生长出若干分蘖，可促使根系发育良好，幼苗健壮；虽然在拔节之后，大部分蘖逐渐死亡，但在初期，这些分蘖通过光合作用，已经起了积累有机物质、健全主茎生长的作用。争取早期分蘖，还是为了主穗的健全生长。在过度密植的情况下，幼苗拥挤，不能生长初期分蘖，以致植株生长纤弱，反而达不到高产的目的。
    我们要想可靠地获得高产，依靠分蘖不如依靠主茎。因此要取得合理密植的增产效果，达到穗多穗大的目的，首先要有足够的播种量与基本苗数。同时，也必须使基本苗能够生长一定数目的分蘖，使幼苗健壮。
    还需搜集更多材料分析研究
    为了进一步发挥合理密植这一增产技术中心环节的增产作用，还需要根据各方面的材料，抓紧小麦生长季节最后一段时期，环绕以下五个问题做好当地丰产田的分析总结。①不同地区、不同自然条件下的合理密度；②合理密度与土、肥、水条件的相互配合；③合理密度的适宜播种方式；④密植与倒伏的关系；⑤密植与品种的关系。
