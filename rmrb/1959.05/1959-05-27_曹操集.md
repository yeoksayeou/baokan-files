	"Collected Works of Cao Cao"
	Currently, academic circles are discussing the evaluation of Cao Cao, and everyone hopes to read Cao Cao's own works. However, Cao Cao's poems and prose were previously collected in some general collections or selections, and no special collection has been reprinted in recent years. In order to cooperate with this academic discussion and facilitate research by researchers and the general public, Zhonghua Book Company has recently collated and proofread Cao Cao's poems, prose, and his grandson's annotations, and compiled them into a collection for publication, entitled "Collected Works of Cao Cao." In addition to more than 20 poems and 3 volumes of prose by Cao Cao, and 13 articles of Sun Tzu's annotations, this book also includes "Records of the Three Kingdoms," "Biography of Emperor Wu," and Pei Songzhi's annotations, as well as an article "Chronology of Cao Cao" originally published in the third issue of "Historical Research" this year.

    “曹操集”
    目前学术界正在讨论有关曹操评价的问题，大家都希望能读到曹操本人的作品。但是，曹操的诗文从前都收辑在一些总集或选集中，近年来尚无专集重印。中华书局为配合这次学术讨论，便利研究者和广大读者查考，最近已将曹操的诗、文及其孙子注加以整理校点，编定成集出版，书名“曹操集”。这本书除曹操诗二十多首、文三卷和孙子注十三篇外，还附录了“三国志”、“武帝纪”和裴松之注和原来发表在今年“历史研究”第三期上的一篇“曹操年表”。
