One of the important trends in the current international workers' movement is the continuous strengthening of the international solidarity of the working class.

The great unity between the working classes of socialist countries, headed by the Soviet Union, is becoming more consolidated and stronger. In recent years, the friendly cooperation between our country and the trade unions of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has been further enhanced. The vigorous development of the socialist camp's construction undertakings is increasingly attracting hundreds of millions of working people in the capitalist world, who regard it as the most powerful support and encouragement for their struggles. In recent years, the exchange of delegations between trade unions of socialist countries and between trade unions of socialist and capitalist countries has greatly increased. From 1949 to 1958, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the national committees of various industrial trade unions received a total of 470 trade union delegations from various countries, totaling 2,632 people. Among them, 142 delegations with 777 people came from fraternal countries; 257 trade union delegations with 1,559 people came from Asian, African, and Latin American countries; and 71 trade union delegations with 296 people came from Western Europe, North America, and Australia. During the same period, Chinese trade unions were invited to visit foreign countries on 253 occasions, totaling 1,359 people. Among them, there were 167 visits with 988 people to fraternal countries; 29 visits with 130 people to Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and 57 visits with 241 people to Western capitalist countries. These visits by delegations have greatly enhanced unity and friendship. For this year's "May Day," we are pleased to receive trade union representatives from more than 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Australia, many of whom are visiting our country for the first time. Distinguished guests will meet cordially with the working people of our country. Our friends are all over the world, and we are very grateful for their support for our cause.

The unity of the working classes of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has made spectacular progress in the years since the Bandung Conference. The rapid development of the national liberation movement has greatly promoted the international unity of workers in this vast region, and the unification movement of trade unions has also made great progress. The workers of our country are particularly pleased to see the victory of the Iraqi revolution and the upsurge of the workers' movement after the victory of the revolution. We also rejoice at the achievements of the Cuban national liberation movement. African workers, under the common goal of opposing imperialism and colonialism, are joining hands and moving forward side by side. The establishment of the General Union of Black African Workers in January this year is a major event in the African workers' movement. The resolution of the founding conference stated that "there is an urgent need to unite all trade union organizations on the African continent" and prepare to "take all necessary measures to convene a pan-African conference with the participation of all African trade union organizations." The General Confederation of Labor of Cameroon held a national trade union conference in February. In addition to the Workers' Strength Union, representatives from the Cameroon Teachers' Union Federation, the Civil Servants' Union, and the Catholic Trade Union also participated. The meeting decided to hold a congress in November this year to formally establish the unified General Confederation of Labor of Cameroon, which will join the General Union of Black African Workers after its establishment. This is an important transformation in the strengthening of unity by Cameroonian trade unions in recent years. In March of this year, the Nigerian Trade Union Federation and the Nigerian Trade Union Council held a merger conference and established the unified Nigerian Labor Congress to welcome the upcoming independence of Nigeria. The unity of the Latin American working class in the anti-American struggle has been further enhanced. It is possible that a Latin American trade union conference including representatives from trade unions throughout Latin America will be held in the coming months to discuss common issues in the struggle against colonialism and dictatorial regimes. The trend of domestic trade union unification in several Latin American countries is also increasing. These factors provide new prospects for the further development of the Latin American workers' movement. In Southeast Asian countries, the unity of trade unions in various countries in the anti-colonial struggle has also been strengthened. For example, the joint statement signed by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on October 3, 1958, is a good example. The joint statement severely condemned the serious threat of US imperialism to peace in Asia and the world, and emphasized that all trade union organizations in Asia and Africa should immediately launch mutual support and joint actions to oppose war and defend peace, thereby strengthening the unity of workers and trade union organizations in Asia and Africa. The close unity of the working classes of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is a very important factor for further promoting the national liberation movement and completely defeating the colonialist system.

The unity of the working classes of the world in the struggle to defend world peace has been further enhanced. Almost all trade unions in the world, despite differences in political views, advocate opposing the testing and use of atomic weapons. In recent years, Japanese trade union organizations and other social groups have organized world conferences every year to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and strive for disarmament, contributing to the struggle to defend peace. Workers have played a huge supporting role in the struggle against armed intervention by imperialist countries in the national liberation movement and have strengthened unity. In September last year, the founding meeting of the International Trade Union Support Algeria Committee was held in Cairo, attended by eighteen trade union organizations including the General Confederation of Labor of Algeria, the Moroccan Labor Federation, the Arab Trade Union International Federation, and the Ceylon Democratic Workers' Congress. The meeting adopted an action program to support the struggle of Algerian workers and people. In May of this year, the committee will hold its second meeting in Sofia to discuss further support for the struggles of workers in Algeria and Africa. In terms of regional joint action to defend peace, the convening of the Workers' Representatives Conference of Baltic Sea Countries should be mentioned. More than 300 representatives from trade unions in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, West Germany, East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union attended the conference, which exposed the danger of West Germany's atomic armament. The meeting wrote letters to the general trade unions of various countries participating in the meeting and to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions, requesting them to take joint action to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone. In order to peacefully resolve the German issue, a European Trade Union and Labor People's Representatives Conference will be held in Görlitz, on the Oder-Neisse border, from May 8 to 10, at the initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The working classes of Western Europe are strengthening unified worker action to oppose the disastrous consequences of the "Coal and Steel Community" and the "Common Market." On January 21-22 this year, representatives of the General Confederation of Labor of France and the General Confederation of Labor of Italy held talks in Rome to study the problems arising from the implementation of the "Common Market" treaty. The general trade unions of the two countries decided to send letters to all general trade unions in France, Italy, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, suggesting a meeting to jointly study these issues. The communist parties of the six Western European countries participating in the "Common Market" called on the people to take concerted action to oppose the policies of monopoly capital in a communiqué issued at a representatives meeting on April 7.

The World Federation of Trade Unions is the banner of the unity of the international working class. Since its establishment nearly fourteen years ago, it has consistently fought tirelessly to safeguard the vital interests of the working class, strive for the democratic freedoms of workers, and defend world peace. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, as a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, strives to fulfill its greatest responsibility to continuously promote the unity of the international working class, as advocated by the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The 19th session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Warsaw in early April, discussed the tasks of trade unions in the struggle to win peace, satisfy the social and economic demands of the working people, and other demands. The resolution adopted by the meeting is of great significance for mobilizing the working people to participate in the struggle against the "Cold War" and the arms race and to strive for the easing of international tensions. The resolution pointed out that "although great achievements have been made in the struggle for peace, the international situation is still tense, and the cause of peace is being seriously threatened; the main source of this threat is the aggressive policies of the imperialists of the United States and some other countries."

This year is the 70th anniversary of the "May Day" International Labor Day. The international workers' movement has achieved immeasurable great victories in these 70 years. Socialism and communism are advancing with overwhelming momentum, the national revolutionary forces are developing rapidly, and the workers' movement in Western capitalist countries is also constantly strengthening. This year's "May Day" is another great demonstration by the working people of the world against imperialism, against colonialism, to defend peace, and to defend the vital interests of the working people.

The workers and people of our country are striving with soaring enthusiasm to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and are strengthening the forces for defending world peace with this practical action to commemorate this year's "May Day." The workers of our country will do their utmost to strengthen solidarity with the working classes of socialist countries, strengthen solidarity with the working classes of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and strengthen solidarity with the working classes of Western capitalist countries. No force in the world can stop the advance of the great torrent of the unity of the international working class. (Attached pictures)

    国际工人阶级统一团结的加强
    刘长胜
    当前国际工人运动的一个重要趋势之一，是工人阶级的国际团结正在不断得到加强。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家工人阶级之间的伟大团结更加巩固和坚强。我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家工会之间的友好合作，近年来进一步增强了。社会主义阵营建设事业的蓬勃发展，越来越吸引着资本主义世界亿万劳动人民，他们把这当作对他们的斗争的一种最有力的支持和鼓舞。最近几年来，社会主义国家工会之间与社会主义国家和资本主义国家工会之间交换代表团的活动大大增强了。从1949年到1958年止，中华全国总工会和各产业工会全国委员会接待了各国工会代表团共达四百七十起，二千六百三十二人。其中来自兄弟国家的代表团达一百四十二起，七百七十七人；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家工会代表团二百五十七起，一千五百五十九人；西欧、北美洲和澳洲工会代表团七十一起，二百九十六人。同一时期，我国工会应邀访问外国的共有二百五十三起，一千三百五十九人。其中去兄弟国家的有一百六十七起，九百八十八人；去亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的有二十九起，一百三十人；去西方资本主义国家的有五十七起，二百四十一人。通过这些代表团的访问，大大增进了团结和友谊。今年“五一”节，我们愉快地接待来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲和澳洲四十多个国家工会代表，其中有不少工会是第一次派代表访问我国。贵宾们将和我国劳动人民亲切会面。我们的朋友遍于全世界，我们十分感谢朋友们对我们事业的支持。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲工人阶级的团结，自从万隆会议召开以来的几年中有了壮阔的发展。民族解放运动势如破竹的发展，大大促进了这一广大地区工人的国际团结，工会的统一运动也有很大的发展。我国工人特别高兴看到伊拉克革命的胜利和革命胜利后工人运动的高涨。我们也为古巴民族解放运动的成就而欢欣。非洲工人在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同目标下，正在携起手来并肩前进。今年1月黑非洲工人总联合会的成立，是非洲工人运动的一件大事，在成立大会的决议中说“迫切需要统一非洲大陆上所有的工会组织”，准备“进行一切必要措施来召开一次非洲所有工会组织参加的全非会议”。喀麦隆总工会2月份举行了全国工会会议，除工人力量工会外，喀麦隆教师工会联合会、公务员工会和天主教工会都派代表参加。会议决定今年11月举行一次代表大会正式成立统一的喀麦隆工人总工会，成立后即参加黑非洲工人总联合会。这是几年来喀麦隆工会加强团结的一个重要转变。今年3月，尼日利亚工会联合会和尼日利亚工会理事会举行了合并大会，并成立了统一的尼日利亚工会大会，迎接尼日利亚即将实现的独立。拉丁美洲工人阶级在反美斗争中的团结有了进一步的增强。最近几个月内有可能召开一次包括整个拉丁美洲工会代表参加的拉丁美洲工会会议，讨论反对殖民主义和独裁政权斗争中的共同问题。拉丁美洲好几个国家国内工会统一的趋势也在增强中。这些因素为拉丁美洲工人运动的进一步开展提供了新的前景。在东南亚国家，各国工会在反殖民主义斗争中的团结也加强了，譬如1958年10月3日中华全国总工会同日本工会总评议会签订的联合声明就是一个很好的例子。联合声明严厉谴责美帝国主义对亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁，强调亚非一切工会组织立即展开相互支援和联合行动，反对战争，保卫和平，从而加强亚非工人和工会组织的团结。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲工人阶级的紧密团结，对于进一步推进民族解放运动、彻底击败殖民主义体系，是一个十分重要的因素。
    全世界工人阶级在保卫世界和平斗争中的团结有了进一步的增强。几乎全世界所有工会，尽管政治见解不同，都主张反对试验和使用原子武器。日本工会组织和其他社会团体最近几年来每年都组织禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，对保卫和平的斗争作出了贡献。工人们在反对帝国主义国家武装干涉民族解放运动的斗争中起了巨大的支援作用，并加强了团结。去年9月，在开罗召开了国际工会支援阿尔及利亚委员会成立会议，十八个工会组织包括阿尔及利亚总工会、摩洛哥劳工联合会、阿拉伯工会国际联合会和锡兰民主工人大会，参加了这次会议。会议通过了支援阿尔及利亚工人和人民斗争的行动纲领。今年5月该委员会将在索非亚召开第二次会议，讨论对阿尔及利亚和非洲工人斗争的进一步支持的问题。在保卫和平斗争的区域性共同行动方面，应该提一下波罗的海国家工人代表会议的召开。丹麦、瑞典、挪威、芬兰、西德、民主德国、波兰和苏联工会三百多名代表出席了这次会议，会议揭露了西德进行原子武装的危险性。会议写信给参加会议的各国总工会和世界工会联合会、国际自由工会联合会、国际基督教工会联合会，要求他们共同行动来建立一个无原子武器地区。为了和平解决德国问题，在世界工联的倡议下，5月8日至10日将在奥得和尼斯国界线上的格利茨城举行欧洲工会和劳动人民代表会议。
    西欧工人阶级正在加强工人的统一行动，反对“煤钢联营”和“共同市场”的灾难性后果。今年1月21—22日，法国总工会和意大利总工会的代表在罗马举行会谈，研究“共同市场”条约实施后所产生的问题。两国总工会决定向法国、意大利、西德、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡的所有总工会发出信件，建议举行会晤，共同研究这些问题。参加“共同市场”的西欧六国的共产党在4月7日发表的代表会议公报中，号召人民一致行动起来反对垄断资本的政策。
    世界工联是国际工人阶级统一团结的旗帜。自从它成立将近十四年以来，一贯为维护工人阶级的切身利益、争取工人的民主自由和保卫世界和平而作着不懈的斗争。中华全国总工会作为世界工联的会员之一，努力为贯彻世界工联所倡导的不断促进国际工人阶级的团结尽自己的最大责任。
  4月初在华沙召开的世界工联执行委员会第十九次会议，讨论了工会在争取和平、争取满足劳动人民的社会经济要求和其他要求的斗争中的任务问题。会议所通过的决议对动员劳动人民参加反对“冷战”和军备竞赛、争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争具有重要意义。决议指出，“尽管争取和平的斗争已经取得了很大的成就，可是国际局势仍然是紧张的，和平事业正受到严重的威胁；这个威胁的主要根源就是美国和一些其他国家的帝国主义者的侵略政策。”
    今年是“五一”国际劳动节的七十周年。国际工人运动在这七十年中取得了难以估量的伟大胜利。社会主义和共产主义以排山倒海之势浩荡前进，民族革命力量正在摧枯拉朽地向前发展，西方资本主义国家工人运动也在不断加强。今年的“五一”节是全世界劳动人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、保卫和平和劳动人民切身利益的又一次大示威。
    我国工人和人民正以冲天干劲，努力实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进，用这个实际行动加强保卫世界和平的力量，纪念今年的“五一”节。我国工人将尽最大努力加强和社会主义国家工人阶级的团结，加强和亚洲、非洲以及拉丁美洲国家工人阶级的团结，加强和西方资本主义国家工人阶级的团结。世界上没有任何力量可以阻挡得住国际工人阶级统一团结这个巨流的前进。（附图片）
