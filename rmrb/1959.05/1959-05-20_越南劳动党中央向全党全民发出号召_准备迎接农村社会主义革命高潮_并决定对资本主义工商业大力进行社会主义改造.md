Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 19th: The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party recently held its Sixteenth (Enlarged) Meeting to discuss the issues of agricultural collectivization and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

The communique of the meeting issued today by the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party stated that after listening to the report on the agricultural collectivization movement in recent years, the meeting believed that since the end of 1958, significant changes have occurred in the rural areas of North Vietnam in terms of embarking on the socialist road. Under the education and leadership of the Party, and influenced by the great victories of Soviet communist construction and the great achievements of socialist construction in China and other socialist countries, and based on their own personal experiences, the laboring farmers have realized that only through collective production can they solve the difficulties in their production and daily lives. Therefore, a large proportion of the laboring farmers have actively embarked on the road of agricultural collectivization. The agricultural collectivization movement has formed a mass movement.

The communique said that we are currently carrying out a socialist revolution in North Vietnam. To build socialism, we must rely on the two solid legs of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Agricultural collectivization will create conditions for the socialist industrialization of North Vietnam. The Sixteenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party put forward the current urgent task of the Party in the rural areas of the North: when there is a new increase in the socialist trend in the countryside, efforts should be made to consolidate the existing mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and preparations should be made in terms of principles, policies, ideology, organization, cadres, and plans, in order to actively and steadily develop the agricultural collectivization movement, usher in the high tide of the socialist revolution in the countryside, and strive to victoriously complete the socialist revolution in agriculture.

The meeting also put forward guidelines, lines, principles, and some specific policies on agricultural collectivization. The meeting particularly emphasized that in the agricultural collectivization movement, it is necessary to strengthen leadership in ideology, policy, organization, and planning to ensure the sound development of the agricultural collectivization movement.

Regarding the socialist transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce, the meeting believed that since the restoration of peace, thanks to the education and assistance of the Party and the government, capitalists in North Vietnam have shown varying degrees of progress in accepting socialist transformation and have played a certain role in the cause of restoring and initially developing the national economy. In recent years, in the process of implementing the policies of the Party and the government, private industry and commerce have undergone preliminary transformation through lower and intermediate forms of state capitalism. Therefore, the negative and backward aspects of capitalist industry and commerce have been restricted, while the positive aspects that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been promoted. At the same time, the increasing development of the state-owned economy and cooperative components has created favorable conditions for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

The communique said that the meeting put forward the task of vigorously implementing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and believed that it is necessary to strengthen unity and education for capitalists within the Fatherland Front. While transforming capitalist enterprises, appropriate arrangements should be made for the capitalists' lives and work, utilizing their technical and enterprise management experience, creating conditions for them to carry out self-transformation, and transforming them into laborers who serve the motherland and the people.

Finally, the communique called on the entire Party and people to further unite closely, give full play to their high revolutionary enthusiasm, and strive to overcome difficulties so as to victoriously implement the resolutions adopted by the Sixteenth Meeting of the Central Committee of the Party, complete the socialist transformation of agriculture and private capitalist industry and commerce in North Vietnam, make the North move towards socialism, and become a solid foundation for the struggle for national reunification.

    越南劳动党中央向全党全民发出号召
    准备迎接农村社会主义革命高潮
    并决定对资本主义工商业大力进行社会主义改造
    新华社河内19日电　越南劳动党中央委员会最近举行了第十六次（扩大）会议，讨论农业合作化和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题。
    越南劳动党中央委员会今天发表的会议公报说，会议在听取了关于近几年来农业合作化运动的报告后认为：自1958年年底以来，越南北方农村已经出现了走社会主义道路的重要变化。劳动农民在党的教育和领导下，在苏联共产主义建设的伟大胜利和在中国以及其它社会主义国家的社会主义建设的伟大成就的影响下，同时根据自己的切身经验，已经认识到只有进行集体生产，才能解决他们在生产和日常生活中的困难。因此，劳动农民中的一大部分已经积极地走上农业合作化道路。农业合作化运动已经形成一个群众性的运动。
    公报说，我们目前正在越南北方进行社会主义革命。要建设社会主义，就要依靠社会主义工业化和农业合作化的两条稳健的腿走路。农业合作化将为越南北方的社会主义工业化创造条件。党的第十六次中央全会提出了党在北方农村中当前的迫切任务是：当农村社会主义趋势有了新的增长的时候，要努力巩固现有的变工组和合作社，并在方针、政策、思想、组织、干部和计划各方面做好准备，以便积极地和稳步地发展农业合作化运动，迎接农村社会主义革命高潮的到来，为胜利地完成农业的社会主义革命而奋斗。
  会议还提出了关于农业合作化的方针、路线、原则和一些具体政策。会议特别强调在农业合作化运动中，要加强思想、政策、组织和计划各方面的领导，保证农业合作化运动良好地发展。
    关于私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题，会议认为：自从和平恢复以来，由于党和政府的教育和帮助，越南北方的资本家在接受社会主义改造方面表现了不同程度的进步，并且在恢复和初步发展国民经济的事业中起了一定的作用。最近几年来，在执行党和政府的政策的过程中，私营工商业通过低级和中级的国家资本主义形式，进行了初步的改造，因此，资本主义工商业的消极和落后面受到了限制，而有利于国计民生的积极方面得到了发扬。同时，国营经济和合作社成分的日益发展，已经为资本主义工商业的社会主义改造创造了有利的条件。
    公报说，会议提出了大力执行对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的任务，并且认为，应当在祖国战线内加强对资本家的团结和教育，在改造资本主义企业的同时，应当对资本家的生活和工作给予适当的安排，利用他们的技术和管理企业的经验，为他们进行自我改造创造条件，把他们改造成为为祖国和人民服务的劳动者。
    公报最后号召全党、全民进一步紧密团结，发挥高度的革命热情，努力克服困难，以便胜利地实现党中央委员会第十六次会议所通过的各项决议，在越南北方完成农业和私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，使北方走向社会主义，成为争取国家统一的巩固基础。
