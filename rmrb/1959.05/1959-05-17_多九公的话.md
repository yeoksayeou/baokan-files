Old Man Duo Jiu's Words
\tLiu Di

"Flowers in the Mirror" tells a story: Lin Zhiyang asked his brother-in-law Tang Ao to pick a fruit called "Ten-Thousand Flavor Nut." He was convinced that Tang Ao, after eating "Sky-Treading Grass," could jump five or six zhang high. Even though the fruit tree was over ten zhang tall, a jump or two would be enough to get the fruit. The result was the opposite; after Tang Ao leaped into the air, he fell back down on the second jump. Old Man Duo Jiu saw the problem and said, "When you jump upward in the air, your feet must exert force, but since they are not on solid ground, how can you not fall?" Old Man Duo Jiu's words explained a principle: doing things requires being grounded. Tang Ao's entire lesson in falling was due to "not being grounded."

In real life, there are many people like Tang Ao who stumble because they are not grounded. Currently, people are continuing the Great Leap Forward, striving to complete or exceed this year's production plan. To pick the fruit is everyone's common desire, but there are different views and approaches on how to get the fruit. Some people are grounded, exert their full energy, and with a powerful leap, the fruit is within reach; others have their feet in the air, and although they have energy, they cannot apply it effectively, resulting in missing the target.

Recently, I participated in a month of labor at the Miyun Reservoir, where the labor competition was in full swing. There was a thought-provoking episode in the competition: a team of strong young men and another team with weaker bodies and more female comrades engaged in a challenge to see who could excavate and transport more earthwork and complete the task better. It seemed that the victory in this competition would inevitably fall into the hands of the team of strong young men, but the opposite was true. The winning red flag was captured by the team with weaker physical strength. Why? Because the latter team conducted in-depth ideological mobilization during the competition, fully assessed their own favorable and unfavorable conditions, formulated achievable and realistic planned targets and reliable measures, and came up with many clever methods to work steadily and diligently. As their enthusiasm grew, their production achievements increased. The team of strong young men, however, ignored all of this. Relying on the idea that "one person is stronger than two of you," they assumed victory was in hand and worked hard solely on brute force, without studying how to ensure the realization of the planned targets. As a result, the targets they set were too high, and they failed to complete the plan from the start. This unfavorable start damaged their vitality, and their subsequent results fluctuated. By the time they realized that this approach would not work, they had already fallen behind. Here, one victory and one defeat illustrate the importance of being grounded!

To be "grounded," one must first have an honest attitude. We all remember Chairman Mao's words: "We should be honest in our work; it is fundamentally impossible to accomplish anything in the world without an honest attitude." Without an honest attitude, jumping around haphazardly, one cannot be grounded. "Ground" also refers to the existing work foundation, objective reality, and objective possibilities. When we do things and set targets, we must proceed from reality. We must do what can be achieved through effort, and do as much as we can. We should talk less and do more, leaving room for maneuver. We should not make absolute statements or rigidly define things, saying more than we do, exaggerating and being unrealistic. Consistency between subjective understanding and objective circumstances is a prerequisite for doing a good job. If our feet are not on the ground, detached from reality, and based solely on subjective desires, we will naturally fall from mid-air like Tang Ao picking fruit.

Those who are good at being grounded always work step by step, becoming more and more detailed. They analyze matters specifically, plan carefully, consider comprehensively, arrange everything, ensure everything is implemented, do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles without certainty of victory, set practical targets, and implement effective measures. If a target is set at ten points, they use twelve points of measures to ensure its implementation. This is a valuable scientific attitude and a spirit of responsibility. Once anything is investigated, researched, and carefully calculated, it becomes real. Walking step by step, implementing things one by one, this is the only way to advance without retreating and remain invincible forever.

Being grounded is a matter of attitude towards things, as well as a matter of working methods and work style. If some comrades misunderstand being grounded as standing still, being conservative, that is a big mistake. Being grounded is inseparable from revolutionary enthusiasm; "implementation" is not "lagging behind." On the revolutionary journey, we must be grounded, yet also have foresight and courage to move forward, keeping our eyes on the future and advancing step by step towards victory.

    多九公的话
    柳笛
    “镜花缘”中讲过一个故事：林之洋要他的妹夫唐敖去摘名叫“万味核”的果子，他满以为唐敖吃了“蹑空草”能够一跳五六丈高，虽然果树高达十几丈，一跳再跳就可以把果子摘到手了。结果相反，唐敖向空中一窜之后，再一窜就跌下来了。多九公在一旁看出了问题，他说：“你在空中要朝上窜，两脚势必用力，又非脚踏实地，焉有不坠？”多九公的话讲明了一个道理：办事情要脚踏实地，唐敖栽跟斗的全部教训就在于“非脚踏实地”。
    在现实生活中，像唐敖一样因为没有脚踏实地而栽跟斗的人是不少的。现在，人们正在继续大跃进，力争完成或超额完成今年的生产计划。要摘果子，是大家的共同愿望，可是怎样才能把果子摘到手，看法和作法却各有不同。有些人脚踏实地，鼓足干劲，猛力一跳，果子举手可得；也有些人脚在半空，虽有干劲，却用不到得力的地方，结果扑空。
    最近，我到密云水库参加了一个月的劳动，那里的劳动竞赛搞得热火朝天。竞赛中有段发人深思的插曲：一个棒小伙子队和另一个身体较弱、女同志较多的小队展开了挑战应战，比赛谁挖运的土方数多，完成任务好。看来，这场竞赛的胜利必然会落在棒小伙子队的手里，可是事实相反，优胜红旗却被那个体力较差的小队夺了去。为什么呢？因为后者在竞赛中做了深入的思想动员，充分估计了自己的有利条件和不利条件，制定了可望而又可即的计划指标和切实可靠的措施，想出了许多巧干的办法，稳扎稳打，干劲越鼓越足，生产成绩越来越大。那棒小伙子队却不管这些，他们凭着“一人能顶你两个人力气大”，自以为胜利在握，单凭一股子劲头猛干，并不研究如何保证计划指标的实现。结果他们订的指标过高，一开始就没有完成计划；出师不利，伤了元气，以后的成绩忽高忽低，等认识到这样干下去不行的时候，早已名落孙山了。这里，一胜一败，说明讲究脚踏实地是何等重要！
    要“脚踏实地”，首先要有老实的态度。我们都记得毛主席的一句话：“我们应该是老老实实地办事；在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”态度不老实，胡蹦乱跳，自然不能脚踏实地。“实地”也就是指的现有的工作基础、客观实际和客观可能性。我们做事情、订指标，都要从实际出发，经过努力可以做到的事情，一定去做，能做多少就是多少，要少说多做，留有余地；不要把话说得太绝，把事情规定得太死，说多做少，浮夸不实。主观认识和客观情况一致，是做好工作的一个先决条件。脚不沾地，脱离实际，只从主观愿望出发，自然要像唐敖摘果子一样从半空中掉下来。
    善于脚踏实地的人，做起工作来总是步步深入，越做越细。他们遇事具体分析，计划周到，考虑全面，办事情件件有安排，事事有着落，不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗，指标切实，措施有效；是十分指标就用十二分措施保证它落实。这是一种可贵的科学态度，是一种认真负责的精神。任何事情一经调查研究、算细账，就变得实在起来了。走路步步落地，办事情件件落实，这样，才能有进无退，永远立于不败之地。
    脚踏实地，这是个对待事物的态度问题，也是个工作方法和工作作风的问题。如果有些同志把脚踏实地误解为踏步不前、因循保守，那就大错了。脚踏实地永远离不开革命干劲，“落实”并不是“落后”。在革命的里程中，我们既要脚踏实地，又要高瞻远瞩、勇往直前，眼睛看着前方，一步一步地向胜利走去。
