Speeches by Delegates Yu Hongzheng and Yue Jieheng

Comrades Chairman and fellow delegates:

We fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan, and other reports presented at the conference. We will resolutely implement all the instructions concerning scientific undertakings in Premier Zhou's report in our work. Here, based on what we have heard and seen, we will give a brief report to the conference on the new situation of the great leap forward in scientific undertakings in the Shaanxi region over the past year, and share our understanding of the Party's various guidelines and policies on scientific undertakings, hoping for criticism and correction.

The original foundation of scientific undertakings in the Shaanxi region was very weak. In the past few years, thanks to the correct leadership of party and government at all levels and the strong support of the broad masses, significant improvements have been made. Since 1958, under the new situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, tremendous changes have taken place, forming a magnificent and prosperous scene, and a new situation has emerged.

The Scientific Research Work in Shaanxi Region Has Achieved Good Results, Completing More Than 200 Research Projects Last Year

Before 1958, there were only four scientific research institutions in the Shaanxi region: the Northwest Institute of Biology and Pedology, the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute, the Archaeological Research Office, and the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory. Scientific research in institutions of higher learning had not yet been widely carried out. After 1958, a total of five science academies were established (Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Building Sciences, Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Posts and Telecommunications Sciences, and Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Medical Sciences), along with research institutes and offices led by various departments and bureaus, totaling 66 institutions. Some cities and counties have established research institutions in agriculture and local resources based on the needs of local production. In addition, research institutions are established in institutions of higher learning in conjunction with teaching; research institutions are established in industrial and mining enterprises in conjunction with production; and research institutions are established in people's communes in conjunction with cultivating improved varieties and improving farming techniques. Scientific undertakings in the province are progressing vigorously, and the call for the whole people to run science and the whole party to run science has been universally responded to. The Provincial Science Work Committee was established in August 1958 to make comprehensive plans for scientific undertakings throughout the province. The preparatory work for the Provincial Science and Technology Association began in October 1958, launching mass scientific and technological activities. Forty-six cities and counties in the province have established science association organizations, and the various specialized societies affiliated with the science association have a total of more than 3,000 members. The establishment of these institutions has played a significant role in promoting scientific undertakings in the Shaanxi region in terms of both improvement and popularization.

Under the correct leadership of party and government at all levels, scientific work in the Shaanxi region has achieved good results in the past year. First of all, scientific undertakings throughout the province have been comprehensively planned, and scientific work can be carried out in an organized and planned manner. Last year, the Provincial Science Committee organized forces to formulate a scientific work plan for the Shaanxi region from 1958 to 1962, and specially arranged the work plan for 1958. This year, in conjunction with the new situation of the great leap forward in production, it formulated the scientific work plan for 1959. At the same time, the Provincial Science and Technology Association also formulated a work plan for 1959, mobilizing scientific and technological personnel and the broad masses of workers and peasants throughout the province to actively participate in the current technical innovation movement, improve labor productivity, and strive to realize the 1959 national economic plan and scientific and technological development plan. In the implementation of the research plan, a total of 206 research projects were completed last year. These projects basically meet the needs of current production and construction, while improving the level of scientific and technological research and strengthening the ranks of scientific workers. In the latest scientific and technological fields, such as radio technology, electronic computers, semiconductors, ultrasonics, and radioactive isotopes, research has been initially carried out. In the field of industrial technology, a large number of research topics that were not available or were considered impossible in the past have been carried out, transitioning from small-scale research to large-scale research, and from learning advanced foreign technologies to exploring originality. For example, the machinery industry has solved the technical problems of general machinery manufacturing and is moving towards large-scale and precision, and is vigorously carrying out independent design work. In the chemical industry, several advanced plastics have been trial-produced. In the textile industry, electrostatic spinning and air-jet shuttleless weaving have been successfully tested. In the field of agricultural science, the broad masses of farmers, in combination with scientific and technological personnel, have conducted research on high-yield production, and have initially summarized several basic principles and key technical measures to ensure agricultural high-yield, improved and created several new agricultural machinery, and carried out soil census work throughout the province, achieving certain results. In the field of medical treatment, several advanced technologies at home and abroad have been mastered, and some originality can be achieved; a large number of traditional Chinese medicine heritages have been excavated, and the special effects of some traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions have been initially summarized; in terms of endemic diseases and infectious diseases that seriously affect people's health, investigations and research have been carried out, and preliminary results have been obtained in some aspects, preparing conditions for controlling and eliminating these diseases. In terms of resource investigation and mineral exploration, like other parts of the country, a great harvest has been achieved, and the experience of the masses in finding mines has been initially summarized. Not only have considerable quantities of iron, copper, coal, and oil shale been found, but also rare elements such as lithium, molybdenum, and beryllium have been found. Important investigation and research work has also been carried out in terms of water energy utilization and soil and water conservation.

Scientific Research Undertakings Are Gradually Mastered by the Masses, and Inventions and Creations by Workers and Peasants Appear in Large Numbers

In the development of scientific undertakings in the Shaanxi region over the past year, we have first deeply recognized the correctness of the Party's policy of scientific research serving production and construction. Due to the leap forward in production and construction, scientific undertakings have also made a leap forward. Most of the 206 research projects completed in 1958 were about problems in production and construction. The work set by various specialized research institutes has become more clear and achieved greater results due to the combination with production and construction. The scientific research work of various institutions of higher learning has become unprecedentedly active due to the combination with production and construction, changing the cold and deserted situation in the past. As for industrial and mining enterprises and the vast rural areas, scientific research has been universally carried out due to solving problems in production and farming. Secondly, we deeply recognize the correctness of the mass line proposed by the Party. The solution of technical problems in industrial and mining enterprises mainly relies on the cooperation of the broad masses of workers and technicians. For example, the new oil production equipment installed in the Xi'an Oil and Grease Chemical Plant was imported from Western European countries and has a rather complex structure. The blueprint is incomplete, and many difficulties were encountered in the installation work. The comrades in the factory, under the call of the general line, decided to install it by themselves. Technicians and workers studied and pondered together, and it is now nearing completion. In terms of agricultural high-yield research, experiments on close planting, fertilization, tillering, irrigation, and ventilation have been universally promoted due to the mobilization of the masses. Experimental fields are everywhere, conducting work under different conditions and environments, greatly enriching the content of the experiments, and accumulating valuable materials for scientific research. In terms of resource investigation and mineral exploration, the participation and assistance of the masses have played an extremely important role. Moreover, workers and peasants, due to the liberation of their minds and the upsurge of their enthusiasm, are determined to overcome difficulties in accepting scientific and technological knowledge. During the great steelmaking campaign last year, many workers and peasants, after short-term training, were basically able to master techniques such as ore identification and testing. In the soil survey work, the peasants transferred from various places were also able to master soil identification work and technology after short-term training. Science can exert its power only when it is mastered by the masses. The importance of following the mass line in scientific work has been fully confirmed. Thirdly, we have deeply recognized that the style of liberating thought, working hard, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, advocated by the Party, plays an extremely important role in scientific and technological work. Under this call, inventions and creations made by workers and peasants have continued to emerge. For example, young worker Xu Chuangen created the nine-coordinate point and fifteen-coordinate point forming lathe processing method, which greatly improved work efficiency. Farmer "Living Luban" Liu Hengjie cooperated with experts to create a small animal-powered wheat harvester, which won a special award at the National Agricultural Tool Evaluation Conference. National famous agricultural labor model Wang Baojing has cultivated many new varieties of wheat, corn and other crops. National cotton-growing expert Zhang Qiuxiang has summarized the experience of high-yield cotton production of 3,000 catties of seed cotton per mu, which has been valued and supported by the broad masses of farmers. Everywhere, a cotton-growing movement of "learning from Qiuxiang, catching up with Qiuxiang, and surpassing Qiuxiang" has been set off, pushing the cotton high-yield movement to a new climax. During our inspection work this year, we saw that the staff of the Xi'an Geophysical Instrument Factory were able to independently design and manufacture a multi-line automatic downhole electrical measuring instrument that reached international standards, and also manufactured quartz fiber gravimeters and metal fiber gravimeters, while the factory's senior technicians were only graduates of general polytechnic institutes. For example, the Xi'an Optical Instrument Factory has manufactured a variety of precision measuring instruments, all of which have reached international standards. These examples all show that the broad masses and scientific and technological personnel after ideological liberation have infinite wisdom and power, and there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of them.

Of course, there are still some shortcomings and problems in scientific undertakings in the Shaanxi region. Scientific and technological work throughout the province has not been carried out comprehensively and in-depth, and scientific and technological forces have not been fully organized and mobilized. Currently, these shortcomings and problems are being gradually overcome and resolved in the work.

Combining Workers and Peasants with Scientific and Technological Workers, Combining Young People with Old Scientists, and Improving the Quality of Scientific Research Work

According to the spirit of the instructions in Premier Zhou's report, scientific work in the Shaanxi region must focus on completing the tasks in production and construction, driving all aspects of work, and at the same time grasping cutting-edge science and technology and basic theories. There should be a correct understanding of cutting-edge science. Every scientific and technological field has its cutting-edge. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and a high tower rises from the ground." As a preparation for attacking the cutting edge, basic scientific knowledge plays an extremely important role. The basic courses in universities, the basic operations in laboratories, and the theoretical research in science and technology should all be given full attention. We must continue to implement the mass line, combine the broad masses of workers and peasants with specialized scientific and technological workers, and combine young people with old scientists to learn from each other and help each other. The quality of scientific and technological work must be paid attention to, and technical issues should also be considered from an economic point of view. The research results must be strictly appraised, and revolutionary enthusiasm and realistic spirit must be combined in the work. We must also further strengthen the ranks of scientific workers. On the one hand, it is cultivated by schools at all levels, and on the other hand, it is cultivated by industrial and mining enterprises, which is a more rapid and effective way of cultivation. The Party's policy of schools running factories and factories running schools will play an extremely important role in expanding the ranks of scientific and technological personnel.

We believe that under the correct leadership of the central and local party and government, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and scientific and technological workers in Shaanxi region will work selflessly and work actively, and will make greater leaps forward on the basis of the leap forward in 1958, greatly promoting the technical revolution that has already begun, thereby accelerating our country's socialist construction.

The above report is extremely incomplete, and the opinions put forward are also extremely immature. I hope that the delegates will give criticism and correction.

    陕西科学园地中鲜花朵朵果实累累
    虞宏正、岳劼恒代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们对周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，及大会中其他报告，表示完全赞同和拥护。周总理报告中，对于科学事业的各项指示，我们一定在工作中坚决贯彻。我们在这里把一年来陕西地区科学事业跃进的新形势，根据我们所听到看到的，向大会作出简要的汇报，并谈一下对党在科学事业上各项方针政策的体会，希望予以批评指正。
    陕西地区的科学事业，原有基础非常薄弱。几年来，由于各级党政的正确领导和广大群众的大力支持，已有显著的改进。从一九五八年起在工农业大跃进的新形势下，更发生了巨大的变化，形成了一幅波澜壮阔的繁荣景象，出现了新的局面。
    陕西地区的科学研究工作已经取得良好成绩，去年完成了二百多个研究项目
    在一九五八年前，陕西地区的科学研究机构，只有西北生物土壤研究所，西北农业科学研究所考古研究室，水工实验所等四个单位，高等校院的科学研究，还没有广泛开展。一九五八年后，共设立了五个科学分院（中国科学院陕西分院，农业科学院陕西分院，建筑科学院陕西分院，邮电科学院陕西分院，医学科学院陕西分院），连同各厅局所领导的研究所、室，已有六十六所。部分市、县根据当地生产的需要，建立了农业和地方资源方面的研究机构。此外在高等校院中结合教学建立研究机构；在工矿企业中结合生产建立研究机构；在人民公社中，结合培育良种改进耕作技术建立研究机构。全省科学事业蓬勃地向前进展，全民办科学全党办科学的号召，得到普遍的响应。省的科学工作委员会在一九五八年八月成立，对全省的科学事业作出全面的规划，省的科学技术协会筹备工作，在一九五八年十月开始，展开群众性的科学技术活动。全省有四十六个市县建立了科协组织，科协所隶属的各专门学会，共有会员三千余人。这些机构的设立，对陕西地区科学事业在提高和普及两方面，都起着显著的推动作用。
    在各级党政的正确领导下，一年来陕西地区的科学工作，已取得良好的成绩。首先，全省科学事业有了全面的规划，科学工作得以有组织有计划的进行。省科委去年组织力量，制订了陕西地区从一九五八年到一九六二年的科学工作规划，又特别安排了一九五八年度的工作规划，今年又结合生产大跃进的新形势，制订了一九五九年的科学工作规划。同时省科协也制订了一九五九年的工作规划，发动全省科学技术人员和广大工人农民积极投入当前的技术革新运动，提高劳动生产率，为实现一九五九年国民经济计划和科学技术发展计划而奋斗。在研究规划执行上，去年共完成了二百零六个研究项目。这些项目基本上适应当前生产建设的需要，同时提高了科学技术的研究水平，壮大了科学工作者的队伍。在最新科学技术方面，如无线电技术、电子计算机、半导体、超声波、放射性同位素等的研究已初步开展。在工业技术方面，大量开展了过去没有或认为不能进行的研究课题，从少量小型的研究开始过渡到大量大型的研究，从学习外地先进技术开始过渡到摸索独创。例如机械工业已解决一般机械制造的技术问题，正向大型的和精密的方向迈进，并大力开展自行设计的工作。化工方面试制成几种高级塑料。纺织方面试验成功静电纺纱和喷气无梭织布。在农业科学方面，广大农民群众与科学技术人员相结合，进行了高额丰产的研究，初步总结了若干保证农业丰产的基本原理和关键性的技术措施，改良和创制了若干新式农业机械，并开展了全省的土壤普查工作，取得一定的成绩。在医药治疗方面，掌握了国内外若干先进技术，而且能有一些独创；大量发掘中医遗产，初步总结了一些中医药方的特殊疗效；在严重影响人们身体健康的地方病和传染病方面，进行了调查研究，在某些方面获得了初步成果，为控制消灭这些疾病准备了条件。在资源调查矿产勘探方面，和全国其他各地一样，得到大丰收，初步总结了群众找矿经验，不但找出了相当数量的铁、铜、煤、油页岩的矿藏，并且找出了锂、钼、铍，等等稀有元素的矿藏。水能利用和水土保持方面，也进行了重要的调查研究工作。
    科学研究事业逐步为群众所掌握，工人农民的发明创造大批出现
    在一年来陕西地区科学事业的发展中，我们首先深深地认识到党所提出科学研究为生产建设服务这一方针的正确。由于生产建设的跃进，科学事业随着作出跃进，在一九五八年所完成的二百零六个研究项目，绝大部分是关于生产建设中的问题，各专门研究所定的工作，由于结合生产建设而任务更为明确，取得更大的成绩。各高等校院的科研工作，由于结合生产建设而空前活跃，改变了过去冷冷清清的情况，至于工矿企业和广大农村，则由于解决生产耕作中的问题，科学研究得到普遍的开展。其次，我们深深地认识到党所提出的群众路线的正确，在工矿企业中技术问题的解决，主要依靠广大职工和技术人员的协力合作。例如，西安油脂化工厂安装新式制油设备，是从西欧国家进口的，结构相当复杂，蓝图不完备，安装工作中遇到不少的困难，而厂内工作同志，在总路线的号召下，决定自行安装，技术人员和工人一起研究琢磨，现已将近完成。在农业丰产研究方面，密植、施肥、分蘖、灌溉、通风等试验工作，由于发动群众而得到普遍的推广，到处都有试验田，在不同的条件和环境下进行工作，大大地丰富了试验的内容，给科学研究积累了宝贵的材料。在资源调查、矿产勘探方面，群众的参加和协助，更起着极为重要的作用。而且工人农民由于思想的解放和干劲的高涨，接受科学技术知识上有决心克服困难。去年大炼钢铁时，不少的工人农民经过短期训练之后，对认矿、化验等技术，基本上都能掌握。在土壤调查工作中，从各地调来的农民，经过短期训练也都能掌握土壤鉴别工作和技术。科学为群众所掌握，才能发挥它的威力。科学工作中走群众路线的重要性，得到完全的证实。再其次，我们又深深地认识到党所号召解放思想，鼓足干劲，敢想敢说敢做的风格，在科学技术工作中有极为重要的作用。在这一号召之下，由工人农民做出的发明创造不断出现。如青年工人徐传根，创造了九个座标点和十五个座标点型面车床加工法，大大地提高了工作效率。农民“活鲁班”刘恒杰和专家合作，创造了小型畜力割麦机，在全国农具评比会议上获得了特种奖。全国著名农业劳动模范王保京培育出不少的小麦、玉米等农作物的新品种，全国植棉能手张秋香总结出棉花亩产籽棉三千斤的高额丰产经验，受到广大农民的重视与支持，到处掀起了“学秋香，赶秋香，超秋香”的务棉运动，将棉花丰产运动推向新的高潮。我们今年在视察工作中看见西安地球物理仪器厂的工作人员，能自行设计，制成多线式自动井下电测仪，达到国际水平，又制成石英丝重力仪和金属丝重力仪，而厂中高级技术人员，也不过是一般理工学院的毕业生。又例如西安光学仪器厂制成多种精密测量仪器，都达到国际水平。这些事例都说明思想解放后的广大群众和科学技术人员，有无穷的智慧和力量，在他们面前没有不能克服的困难。
    当然，陕西地区科学事业中还有一些缺点和问题，全省科学技术工作还没有全面深入的开展，科学技术力量还没有全面组织调动起来，目前这些缺点和问题，正在工作中逐步克服和解决。
    工人农民和科技工作者结合，青年人和老科学家结合，提高科学研究工作质量
    根据周总理报告中指示的精神，对陕西地区的科学工作，必须以完成生产建设中的任务为纲，带动各方面工作，同时还要抓尖端科学技术和基础理论，对尖端应有正确的理解，每门科学技术皆有其尖端，“行远自迩，登高自卑”，作为攻尖端的准备，基础科学知识，有极为重要的作用，高等学校的基础课程，实验室的基本操作，以及科学技术中的理论研究，都应当予以充分重视。必须继续贯彻群众路线，把广大工人农民与专门科技工作者结合起来，把青年人和老科学家结合起来，互相学习，互相帮助。科学技术工作的质量，必须加以注意，也应当从经济观点考虑技术问题。研究的成果，必须经过严格的鉴定，在工作中把革命干劲与求实精神结合起来。还必须进一步壮大科学工作者的队伍。一方面由各级学校来培养，另一方面由工矿企业来培养，这是更为迅速有效的培养方式。党所提出学校办工厂、工厂办学校的方针，对于扩大科学技术队伍将起着极为重要的作用。
    我们相信，陕西地区的科学事业，在中央和地方党政的正确领导下，全省广大群众工人农民和科学技术工作者忘我劳动，积极工作，将在五八年跃进的基础上，作出更大的跃进，把已经开始的技术革命，大大地向前促进，从而加速我国的社会主义建设事业。
    以上情况汇报极不全面，提出意见也极不成熟，希望代表们予以批评指正。
