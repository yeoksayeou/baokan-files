Good drama needs good skills
    ——Review of the Yangju Opera "Storm on the Huangpu River"
                           Dai Bufan
    The Yangju Opera "Storm on the Huangpu River" (published in the "Drama Script Monthly," May of this year) is one of the outstanding plays that appeared in the first stage of the Shanghai Municipal Drama Festival of 1959. The same subject matter can produce many different good plays. This play, like the wonderful and moving Huju Operas "Spark" and "Shi Hongmei," depicts the heroic struggle of the Chinese working class against imperialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party on the eve of the May Thirtieth Movement. "Spark" writes about the awakening of Yang Guiei, a female textile worker who flowed from the bankrupt countryside into the city's yarn factory; "Shi Hongmei" writes about the growth of yarn factory female worker Shi Hongmei in the strike struggle; "Storm on the Huangpu River" focuses on portraying two Communist Party members—Old Sun and Lu Zhiying—who lead the workers of their yarn factory in the struggle against Japanese capitalists. The three plays have their own different styles. Relatively speaking, "Spark" has a stronger lyrical flavor and has achievements in the innovation of the Huju Opera form; "Shi Hongmei" wins with the completeness of the characters and the strictness of the structure; while "Storm on the Huangpu River" leaves a memorable impression with the prominence and clarity of the positive images, and the surging momentum.
    The story of "Storm on the Huangpu River" takes place in a certain Japanese yarn factory in western Shanghai in May 1925. The development of the plot is clearly layered and progresses step by step. It describes how Si Sao, an ordinary female worker in the fine yarn workshop, was beaten to death by a Japanese foreman, arousing the workers' indignation, and, at the suggestion of Communist Party member Old Sun, a strike was held in the entire workshop. The strike went through a tortuous and complex struggle process, and finally, linked with the anti-imperialist struggle, merged into the torrent of the vigorous May Thirtieth Movement. The entire play always focuses on the activities of several workers in the fine yarn workshop, but from the development of the increasingly expanded strike struggle, it writes about how the Chinese working class, under the leadership of its vanguard, held higher and higher the torch of anti-imperialist struggle under the increasingly ferocious suppression of imperialism and domestic reactionaries.
    This play not only reflects the truth of the Shanghai workers' anti-imperialist struggle in May 1925 in the entire incident, but also the many dramatic plots it chooses also reflect the true face of life on the eve of the "May Thirtieth," and thus it looks particularly touching. Taking the first scene as an example, it begins with the bonded worker Wang Xiaomei running out of the workshop shouting for help. Then, the smug bonded worker head comes out fiercely, slapping her in the face and scolding her for being lazy; even disregarding her pleas, he picks up a broom handle and beats this thin, weak, hungry, and exhausted child laborer. With just a few strokes, the script exposes the crimes of the inhuman bonded labor system to us. Then, Si Sao, who is pregnant, is about to be fired because she doesn't go to work, and she dies from exhaustion after giving birth to her child in the toilet; and the Japanese foreman comes over and says she is "mooching" and lazy, and wants to fire her; and believes that the workers who come out of the workshop to visit Si Sao are "mooching," and each person is fined two days' wages. Finally, he even commits violence and kicks Si Sao to death. From the fact that the Japanese yarn factory does not allow workers a minute of rest and arbitrarily fines workers' wages, it exposes the cruel oppression of Chinese workers by imperialism; the fact that Japanese ruffians can kill people at will further exposes the inhuman life that Chinese workers lived at that time. These plots, which are almost entirely based on the depiction of the truth of life at that time, cannot but arouse a series of spasms in the audience's hearts and ignite a series of anger. The script completely attracts the audience's sympathy to the side of the striking workers from the beginning. This clear-cut treatment of love and hatred not only has the effect of getting straight to the point when traditional operas report their origins, but is also more vivid and lively than reporting their origins. This powerful beginning makes the audience not only rationally, but also deep in their emotions, urgently demand the overthrow of Japanese imperialism and hope that the striking workers will achieve victory.
    In the increasingly sharp struggle and the increasingly expanded strike movement, this play has well shaped two exciting images of Communist Party members—Old Sun and Lu Zhiying. The young playwrights and directors who are familiar with opera techniques, with their intentions preceding their pens, have very prominently arranged Old Sun's first meeting with the audience. Si Sao has been beaten unconscious, and the workers are discussing what to do?——The playwrights and directors did not arrange for Old Sun to come on stage earlier, or to run over at this moment by chance, but instead, when everyone is racking their brains for a solution, they let a middle-aged female worker say: "I think Master Sun usually has a lot of ideas, let's ask him to discuss it." With a light stroke, the audience is not only focused on waiting to see Old Sun come on stage, but also knows Old Sun's prestige among the workers. Si Sao finally dies, and the worker nicknamed Peng Dapao wants to find an axe to kill Okada. The workers present all agree with Peng Dapao's approach. However, at this moment of public outrage, Old Sun is desperately trying to stop them, shouting: "Brothers! Sisters! We can't go and kill Okada!" He pulls Peng Dapao back with force, saying: "If we kill Okada today, won't the Japanese big boss just send a second foreman to beat and scold our workers?" He says to the workers who are unwilling to be bullied by the Japanese: "If we want to turn over, we can only all go on strike together!" Old Sun, who always speaks concisely and is good at grasping the essentials, guides the workers who are simply starting from revenge to the path of anti-imperialist struggle with a few words. "A second Okada," this is such a vivid language that makes people shudder and awaken, this should be the view of the workers who are beaten and scolded all day long, now it is suddenly pointed out by Old Sun, which shows that Old Sun is an ordinary worker, and also shows that he is a calm, analytical, thoughtful, and higher than ordinary workers. The script does not first introduce Old Sun as the party branch secretary, nor does it let him speak long-winded principles, but, in this decisive moment, in Old Sun's strong blocking action and simple and concise lines that have the greatest persuasiveness for the workers, the image of this party branch secretary is introduced to the audience.
    Old Sun is the main leader of this strike, and he always shows his great role in many key events. We see that the workers have been on strike for a long time, and their lives cannot be maintained, thus causing internal ideological fluctuations, but Old Sun has excellently united the workers together and persisted in the struggle; when a fire suddenly breaks out in the coarse yarn room and everyone is in chaos, Old Sun calmly judges: "It must be the Japanese's conspiracy," and sends someone to guard the aisle, and finally catches the foreman who set the fire, becoming strong evidence to expose the Japanese big boss. The script always pushes this Communist Party member to the front of the stage in such tense and complex situations, showing his leadership ability and judgment in the masses.
  Lu Zhiying is written even better. Since the script initially reveals the arbitrary mistreatment of workers by the Japanese yarn factory, when we see Zhiying protecting the newly delivered Si Sao with her body from the Japanese foreman's whip, and when Si Sao is beaten unconscious, Zhiying shouting "The Japanese have beaten someone to death!" we feel that she is a selfless person, full of class feelings. Old Sun suggests a strike, and the first to raise her hand in favor is Lu Zhiying; it is also Lu Zhiying who successfully completes the task assigned by Old Sun, going to the factory gate to win over new workers in a difficult and dangerous struggle; it is also Lu Zhiying who suddenly gets up to expose the enemy's tricks when the Japanese big boss smugly believes that the arson conspiracy has succeeded and is proudly persuading the workers to resume work. Lu Zhiying is always standing at the forefront of the struggling workers.
    The script writes about the leadership and leading role of these two party members in the strike struggle. At the same time, it also writes about these two characters as ordinary workers. Their experiences are exactly the same as those of all the workers in the factory. For example, in the initial strike, many workers were hungry, and Old Sun was no exception. He had no money in his pockets, and he even took off the worn-out coat he was wearing and gave it to a worker to "pawn"; in the first scene, the Japanese foreman said that those who came out of the workshop to see Si Sao were "mooching" and wanted to fine them two days' wages, and the first to be fined was Zhiying. It is precisely because Old Sun and Zhiying "enjoy" the same "treatment" as ordinary workers in the factory that when they launch a strike and persist in and expand the struggle under the instructions of the higher-level party, the audience feels that this is by no means a matter for the two of them alone; at the same time, this also reflects how correctly the strike and anti-imperialist struggle launched by the party through these two party members at that time represented the unanimous interests of the working class. Through the description of Old Sun and Zhiying, we see the inseparable relationship between the party and the masses of workers.
    Except for the scenes with the enemy, almost every scene in this play has vivid crowd scenes. The authors did not adopt the method of portraying traitors in the masses or belittling the masses to highlight the positive characters. The authors are good at describing the words and deeds of people with different personalities at every critical moment, but without detracting from the loveliness of these characters, while highlighting the positive characters in a series of non-repetitive crowd scenes. Like the example mentioned above, isn't Peng Dapao going to kill Okada very sympathetic and lovable? However, with Old Sun's obstruction, we feel that Old Sun is indeed higher than Peng Dapao. The description of Old Sun "mending the gruel bucket," which is now well-known in Shanghai, just illustrates this point. The hungry striking workers gather at Xiao Zhao's house. Worker A can't stand the hunger anymore and insists on going to work, saying, "I alone won't spoil everyone's affairs"; Peng Dapao gets angry after hearing this and smashes an empty gruel bucket on Xiao Zhao's table. Old Sun, who cherishes things, picks it up and mends it again. Finally, he sees that a piece of wood is missing, searches carefully, and finds that this piece of wood is just being stepped on by worker A. Old Sun picks up the wood and says to worker A earnestly: "If you are missing this piece, the bucket can't be mended!" With one sentence, worker A is finally awakened. In the midst of fierce debate, even if you say a hundred reasons, worker A may not accept them; the bucket can't be mended without a piece, and one metaphor gives him room for contemplation and time to consider changing his mind. When writing a play, it is always easy to fall into reasoning and dryness when writing about leading comrades getting through other people's thoughts. However, the handling of mending the gruel bucket not only makes the reasoning vivid, but more importantly, it shows that Old Sun has not forgotten to carry out ideological education on the masses and strive for the final victory of the strike even at the moment of mending the gruel bucket at hand. And this ingenious metaphor of situational feeling shows how clever and humorous Old Sun is! The script here writes about Peng Dapao's impulsiveness in smashing the bucket, and worker A's support for everyone's strike but his insistence on returning to work because he can't stand the hunger. Although these characters have shortcomings or mistakes, they are still lovable after all. And in such a crowd scene, Old Sun's character is clearly floating in front of us.
    This play writes about the climax of the struggle between the enemy and us, without letting the Japanese big boss come on stage; instead, it lets the new workers recruited by the factory to replace the strikers come on stage. Winning over the new workers not to go to work becomes the key to the success or failure of the strike struggle. If all the new workers go to work, then the factory's plan to fire all the striking workers will be realized, and the strike will not be able to continue. This makes the contradictions and conflicts in the drama increasingly sharp and complex. And the person who is in this place at this time is the positive character Lu Zhiying. This is a very difficult scene to write: Lu Zhiying does not know the new workers who are crowded at the factory gate in the early morning, preparing to go to work, whose families are crying for food. To persuade them not to go to work, of course, she can only desperately reason with them. But once she reasons with them, then the climax of this play will be "flat." However, our talented opera playwrights and directors have solved this problem very well and achieved a thrilling effect. At the beginning of the scene, Lu Zhiying only sings simple but powerful lyrics to the new workers: "We are all bitter workers, bitter gourds grow on the same vine"; the hungry workers don't listen to her and want to enter the factory; she anxiously steps forward to block them, letting the abused Wang Xiaomei come out, showing everyone the bloody scars on her arm; some of the new workers therefore begin to consider their own future. However, after being provoked by foreman Lao San, who is mixed in the crowd: "At this time, the frog wants to live and the snake wants to eat its fill, taking care of yourself is all you can do!" The new workers want to enter the factory again. However, Lu Zhiying, who has sharp eyes and pays attention to the situation in the crowd at all times, finally sees through who is speaking. She finally steps forward and exposes Lao San's disguise. At this time, the new workers suddenly realize. Lao San becomes angry and uses an iron ruler to knock Zhiying down, and uses this to coerce the new workers to enter the factory to work. At this time, Zhiying wakes up, jumps up, stands on the gas lamp tower, hugs the lamp post, and in one breath uses more than twenty lines of lyrics to accuse everyone of the reasons for the strike (the actress Gu Yujun has a wonderful performance here); and lets Si Sao's son bring his mother's bloody clothes for everyone to see. . . . Xiaomei's scars, Si Sao's bloody clothes, and the recruiter's iron ruler finally awaken the new workers, who join the vast strike team one after another. These "real objects" are not only very persuasive to the people on stage, but also have unparalleled persuasiveness to the audience off stage; just like "mending the gruel bucket," these are not abstract or conceptual, but concrete and specific things; these things can fully explain the whole picture of the incident without much additional words. At the same time, they are used to better describe the characters. You see, Xiaomei was originally a very timid person who had been tortured, but now she dares to expose her arms and loudly accuse everyone in front of everyone, and this is because Zhiying has implemented the party's instructions to educate and enlighten Xiaomei well; bringing Si Sao's son and bloody clothes proves that Zhiying has carefully planned when accepting the party's task; she ignores the hole opened in her forehead by the iron ruler, but jumps up and continues the struggle, which shows her tenacious fighting spirit even more. The script here convincingly describes that the new workers have been won over, telling the audience that the Japanese big boss has completely failed, and prominently describes the character of the Communist Party member Lu Zhiying.
    Just like many excellent traditional opera repertoires, the Yangju Opera "Storm on the Huangpu River" has several particularly prominent and wonderful places in the entire play and in each scene that can be savored carefully. If this play is really like a torrent, then there are many amazing floods in this torrent. Taking Lu Zhiying as an example, there are several descriptions that will always be unforgettable. Like exposing the Japanese big boss's buying people to commit arson, it is originally a very gratifying thing: the Japanese big boss said to the masses that it has now been found out that the arsonist is a representative of the striking workers, who has been arrested, and hopes that the "good" workers will resume work together; but he did not expect that although they arrested Old Sun and others, the foreman he bought to commit arson was also caught by the workers. Lu Zhiying steps forward to expose the truth about the fire at this time. This was originally a very dramatic scene. But the clever directors are not satisfied with this, they first let the Japanese big boss stand on a long bench in the workshop, smugly believing that his trick has succeeded, and proudly persuading the workers to resume work. The workers ask him if there is evidence that Old Sun set the fire, and he says there is evidence. At this time, the excited Lu Zhiying suddenly jumps onto the table behind the big boss, loudly pointing at the big boss's nose as he turns around and says: "I don't think you'll ever be able to produce any evidence!" Finally, she orders the foreman who set the fire to be dragged out, and the big boss has to leave in a panic. The big boss stands on the bench triumphantly, but Lu Zhiying jumps on the table to expose him. This scene, contrary to the saying, really makes people feel that "the devil is one foot tall, and the Tao is ten feet tall!" Lu Zhiying's winning over of the new workers and her face-to-face struggle with the Japanese big boss are both very sharp; but if there were no "odd peaks" like hugging the lamp post and getting on the table, the positive image in this sharp conflict would not be as radiant as it is now. This treatment is found according to the character's passion at the time, and it in turn adds to the description of the character's passion.
    This opera repertoire, which is full of the bold style of Yangju Opera, can often create exciting good plays where there is no play. Like after Si Sao's death in the first scene, everyone decides to strike. Here, the playwrights and directors finally abandoned their initial treatment: letting the characters on the scene express their determination to strike in a chorus to end the scene. The current treatment is this: the workers decide to strike and silently surround Si Sao's corpse; at the same time, the scene uses the suona to blow the "6" of the small worker tune from low to high, playing a long mourning sound, matching the drums from light to heavy and from slow to fast, as if blowing and beating all the grief and indignation in people's hearts to the sky. In this mourning music, Lu Zhiying, who was the first to raise her hand in favor of the strike, lowers her head and finds that she is still wearing a white work apron, immediately takes it off and throws it to the ground fiercely. When the other workers see this, they also take off and throw their aprons one after another. And Old Sun,——Old Sun, to whom Si Sao entrusted her orphan before her death, goes to pick up the corpse and walks out of the workshop, and the workers who have taken off their aprons also follow him out slowly. Throwing the apron, what a great determination! Carrying the corpse out, what deep feelings! Throwing the apron and following Old Sun out of the workshop shows that everyone is officially on strike under the leadership of the party. It looks like this is the "exit" technique of opera, but, in such a sad and indignant percussion, such an "exit" can explain the problem better than using a thousand sentences of chorus to express the workers' determination. Because, this is a play performed through the actions of the characters that are coordinated with the music. And in this place, which is most easily handled by people using non-opera techniques to make it have no play, this play has made a moving effect. Another example is the last scene: Xu Hua, the person in charge of the higher-level party, brings the news that Gu Zhenghong has been brutally killed, and calls on the workers to participate in the May Thirtieth Movement. Here, if they were playwrights and directors who like to use non-opera techniques, they might end the entire play with a chorus, or let the workers raise their hands in favor and line up to exit the scene. However, this play does not handle it this way. It does not forget to show the main character Old Sun again in the end. It lets Old Sun take off his black coat after hearing the news, tear it into black gauze, and distribute it to everyone. Tearing clothes and wearing gauze takes one or two minutes, but the opera directors do not let the audience quietly "watch" the wrapping of gauze, but also let the audience "listen": the scene uses the suona to play the Yangju Opera [Feng Ru Song] tune, still matching the increasingly urgent "rolling drums," so that the stage is not deserted; the gongs and drums beat out the irrepressible angry emotions of the people in the play who are wrapping the gauze, so that when they wrap the black gauze and follow Xu Hua through the high slope to participate in the city-wide demonstration, the mass emotions that are truly like the angry tide of the Huangpu River are conveyed to the audience under the stage in the strongest and most urgent sound of the rolling drums.
    The Yangju Opera "Storm on the Huangpu River" is not only good in its subject matter, good in its thought, and good in its characters; at the same time, these advantages are expressed in the bold style of Yangju Opera. When it uses opera forms to reflect modern life, it is not limited to bureaucratically, fragmentarily, and trivially transplanting certain ready-made and suitable things from old plays into the play. Its method of dealing with this brand-new and major subject matter is to "transform" it based on the expression methods and techniques of opera, after a period of painstaking management and comprehensive understanding. It not only reasonably arranges singing and actions according to the laws of opera, but also is good at using the composition methods of traditional opera choreography and directing to prominently express the characters.
    When a vigorous modern subject matter is truly expressed using traditional laws, it is truly like a fish in water, and will show a lively and vigorous posture!

    好戏需要好技巧
    ——评扬剧“黄浦江激流”
                           戴不凡
    扬剧“黄浦江激流”（载剧本月刊本年5月号）是上海市1959年戏剧会演（第一阶段）中出现的优秀剧目之一。同一个题材可以写出许多不同的好戏。这个戏和精彩动人的沪剧“星星之火”“史红梅”一样，都是描写五卅运动前夕，中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下反对帝国主义的英勇斗争。“星星之火”写一个从破产的农村流入城市的纱厂女工杨桂英的觉醒；“史红梅”写纱厂女工史红梅在罢工斗争中的成长；“黄浦江激流”则正面描写两个共产党员——老孙和卢志英，如何领导着他们纱厂的工人群众向日本资本家斗争。三个戏有各自不同的风格。比较起来，“星星之火”抒情的味道更浓，在沪剧形式的革新上有成绩；“史红梅”以人物的完整和结构谨严取胜；而“黄浦江激流”则以正面形象的突出鲜明，气势汹涌澎湃，给人留下难忘的印象。
    “黄浦江激流”的故事发生在1925年5月沪西某日本纱厂。剧情的发展层次分明，步步开展。它写一个普通的细纱车间女工四嫂，被日本领班打死，激起了工人们的愤慨，在共产党员老孙的建议下，举行了全车间的罢工。罢工经过了曲折而复杂的斗争过程，最后并且和反帝斗争联结起来，汇入了轰轰烈烈的五卅运动的洪流。整个戏始终以细纱车间的几个工人的活动为中心，但从越来越扩大的罢工斗争的发展中，却写出了在帝国主义和国内反动派越来越凶恶的镇压下，中国工人阶级在自己先锋队的领导下，越擎越高的反帝斗争的火炬。
    这个戏不仅在整个事件上反映了1925年5月的上海工人反帝斗争的真相，而且它所选择的许多戏剧情节，也反映了“五卅”前夜的生活真实面貌，因而看起来分外使人感动。以第一场来说，一开始就是包身工王小妹从车间里逃出来大喊救命，随着，神气十足的包身工头恶狠狠赶出来，打她耳光，骂她偷懒；甚至不顾哀求，顺手拿起扫帚柄，痛打这个皮黄骨瘦、四肢无力、饥饿难当、疲倦不堪的童工。剧本聊聊数笔，就把当时惨无人道的包身工制度的罪恶，揭露在我们面前。接着，怀孕的四嫂，因为不上工就要被开除，劳累过度，竟将孩子生在厕所里淹死了；而东洋领班跑过来反说她“揩油”偷懒，要将她开除；并认为出车间来探望四嫂的工人都是“揩油”，各人罚两天工资。最后竟至行凶，将四嫂踢死。从东洋纱厂不让工人有一分钟的休息，任意罚人工资，暴露了帝国主义对中国工人的残酷压榨；从东洋浪人可以随便打死人，更揭露了当时中国工人过的非人生活。这些几乎完全是按照着当时生活真相描写入剧的情节，不能不引起观众心中一阵阵的痉孪，燃起一阵阵的怒火。剧本在一开始就把观众的同情完全吸引到罢工工人一方面。这种爱憎分明的处理，既有传统戏曲自报家门时开门见山的那种效果，而且较自报家门更形象生动。这个有力的开端，使观众不仅在理智上，而且在感情深处迫切要求打倒日本帝国主义，希望罢工工人取得胜利。
    这个戏在越来越尖锐的斗争中，在越来越扩大的罢工运动中，很好地塑造了两个激动人心的共产党员形象——老孙和卢志英。熟悉戏曲技巧的年青编导们，意在笔先，非常突出地安排了老孙第一次和观众的见面。四嫂被打晕过去了，工人们在议论着怎么办？——编导们没有安排老孙早就上场，或此刻正巧跑过来，而是在大家苦思设法的时候，让一位中年女工说：“我看孙师傅平时的办法很多，还是请他来商量商量吧。”轻轻一笔，就使观众不仅集中注意力等看老孙上场，而且还知道了老孙平时在工人中间的威信。四嫂终于断气了，绰号叫彭大炮的工人，要找把斧头去砍死岗田。在场的工人都赞成彭大炮的做法。但是，就在这群情愤慨的时刻，老孙却拼命在阻拦着，高叫着：“弟兄们！姐妹们！我们不能去砍死岗田！”他用劲拉回彭大炮说：“今天砍死了岗田，东洋大板他就不会再派第二个领班的来打骂我们工人吗？”他对不甘心受东洋人欺侮的工人们说：“我们要翻身，只有大家一齐罢工！”说话总是要言不烦，善于抓住要害的老孙，几句话一点，就把单纯从报复出发的工人们，引导到反帝斗争的道路上来。“第二个岗田”，这是多么形象化，使人怵然警悟的语言，这应当是终日里挨打受骂的工人的看法，现在由老孙突然给指出来，既说明老孙是一个普通工人，又表明了他是个冷静、有分析能力，考虑周密，高于一般工人的人。剧本没有先介绍老孙是党支书，也没有让他讲长篇的大道理，可是，就在这具有决定性的片刻，在老孙强烈的阻拦动作和简单扼要但对工人却具有最大说服力的台词中，把这位党支书的形象介绍给观众了。
    老孙是这次罢工的主要领导人，在许多关键性的事件上，总显示出了他的巨大作用。我们看到，工人罢工日久，生活不能维持，因此引起内部思想动摇，老孙却出色地把工人团结在一起，坚持斗争；在粗纱间忽然起火，大家乱成一团的时候，老孙却冷静地判断：“一定是东洋人的阴谋”，派人去守住过道口，终于捉住放火的工头，成为揭露东洋大板的有力证据。剧本总是在这样紧张、复杂的情况下，把这位共产党员推到舞台前面，在群众中显示出他的领导才能和判断能力。
  卢志英写得更好。由于剧本一开始就把东洋纱厂任意虐待工人的情况先揭示出来，于是，当我们看到志英用身体挡着东洋领班的皮鞭保护刚生产的四嫂，以及当四嫂被打得晕过去，志英高呼“东洋人打死人啦”的时候，我们感到她是一个忘我的人，充满阶级感情的人。老孙建议罢工，首先举手赞成的是卢志英；执行老孙交予的任务，到工厂门口去争取新工人，在艰巨危险的斗争中，获得胜利的也是卢志英；东洋大板自以为放火阴谋得逞，得意洋洋在劝工人复工的时候，突然起来揭穿敌人诡计的，也是卢志英。卢志英，总是站在斗争中的工人群众的最前面。
    剧本写出了这两个党员在罢工斗争中的领导和带头作用。同时，也写出了这两个人物是普通的工人。他们的遭遇，和厂里一切工人的遭遇完全一样，例如，在初期罢工中，许多工人饿肚子了，老孙也不例外，囊无分文的他，竟将身上穿着的一件破外衣也拿给一个工人去“当”了；在第一场，东洋领班说出车间看四嫂的人是“揩油”，要罚两天工资，而首先被罚的就是志英。正因为老孙和志英在厂里“享受”着和普通工人一样的“待遇”，所以，他们发动罢工，在上级党指示下坚持和扩大斗争，就使观众感到，这绝不是他们两个人的事；同时，这又体现了当时党通过这两位党员所发动的罢工反帝斗争，是如何正确地代表了工人阶级的一致利益。通过对老孙和志英的描写，我们看到了党和工人群众水乳交融不可分割的关系。
    这个戏除了写敌人的专场以外，几乎每一场都有有声有色的群众场面。作者们没有采取描写群众中的叛徒或用贬低群众的手法来突出正面人物。作者们善于描写性格不同的群众在每个紧要关口的言行，但并无损于这些人物的可爱，同时却在一系列毫不重复的群众场面中，突出了正面人物。像上面所举的，彭大炮要去砍杀岗田，这不是很令人同情可爱么？然而，由老孙一阻拦，我们又感到老孙的确是高于彭大炮的。目前在上海已经脍炙人口的老孙“箍粥桶”的描写，也正好说明这个问题。饿着肚子的罢工工人们聚集在小赵家里，工人甲饿不过去了，坚持要上工去，他说“我一个人又不会坏了大家的事”；彭大炮听罢，发了脾气，竟将小赵桌上的一只空粥桶给摔在地下。爱惜物事的老孙却随手去拣起来重新箍好，最后看看缺了一块木头，细找，发现这块木头正好被工人甲踩在脚下。老孙拣起木头，对工人甲语重心长地说：“要是少你这块，桶就箍不起来啦！”一句话，终于把工人甲惊醒过来了。在争论激烈的时候，你说一百个道理，工人甲也未见得就会接受；箍桶缺一块都不行，一个譬喻，就使得他有沉思的余地，有改变主张的考虑时间了。写戏，每当写领导同志打通别人思想的时候，总是容易流于说理，干巴。然而，箍粥桶的处理，不仅使说理形象化，更重要的是表现了老孙即使在随手箍粥桶的时刻，也没有忘了对群众进行思想教育，争取罢工的最后胜利。而这种即景生情的巧喻，又表明了老孙是个多么机灵风趣的人！剧本在这里写了彭大炮摔桶的冒燥，写了工人甲既赞成大家罢工但自己又因饿不过而要坚持去复工，这样的人物虽然有缺点或错误，但是，毕竟都还不失其可爱。而就在这样的群众场面中，老孙的性格却很鲜明地浮在我们面前。
    这个戏写敌我斗争的高潮，没有让日本大板出场；而是让厂方新招来代替罢工的工人们上场。争取新工人不上工，于是成为罢工斗争胜败的关键。如果新工人都上工去，那么，厂方开除全体罢工工人的计划就实现了，罢工也就无法继续了。这就使得戏剧的矛盾冲突愈益尖锐复杂。而置身于此时此地的却是正面人物卢志英。这是非常难写的一场戏：卢志英和清晨拥挤在厂门口准备上工的那些全家嗷嗷待哺的新工人们陌不相识。要劝阻他们不上工，当然只有拼命说理。而一说理，那么，这个戏的高潮也就“平”了。可是，我们有才能的戏曲编导们，却把这个难题解决得很好，取得了惊心动魄的效果。一开幕，卢志英只是用简单的，但却有力的唱词向新工人唱道：“我们都是苦工人，苦瓜结在一根藤”；饥饿的工人们不听她的，要进厂；她焦急地上前挡住，让被虐害的王小妹出来，露出臂上血淋淋的条条伤痕给大家看；新工人有的因此开始考虑自己的前途了。可是，经混在群众中的工头老三一挑拨：“这时候田鸡要命蛇要饱，顾了自己别人顾不了！”新工人又要进厂了。但是，目光犀利时刻注意人群中情况的卢志英，毕竟瞧破了这是谁在说话。她终于一步上前，揭去老三的伪装。这时，新工人们恍然大悟了。而老三恼羞成怒，竟用铁尺将志英击倒，并以此胁迫新工人进厂上工。这时，志英醒来，一跃而起，站到煤气灯塔上，抱着灯杆，一口气用二十几句唱词向大家控诉（演员顾玉君在这里有精彩的表演）罢工的原因；并且让四嫂的儿子把他母亲的血衣拿出来给大家看。……小妹的伤痕、四嫂的血衣、招工头的铁尺，终于使新工人觉悟过来，纷纷走入浩荡而来的罢工队伍中。这些“实物”，不仅对于台上人有很大的说服力，而且对台下的观众也有无比的说服力；正像“箍粥桶”一样，这既不是抽象的、概念的，而是形象的、具体的事物；这些事物不须多赘一言就能充分说明事件的全貌。而同时，通过他们却又更好地描写了人物。你看，小妹原是被折磨得很胆怯的人物，这时却敢于在大家面前露出胳膀大声控诉，而这是由于志英执行了党的指示，要很好教育、启发小妹的结果；把四嫂的儿子和血衣带来，又证明志英在接受党的任务时，是经过周密计划的；她不顾铁尺在额上打开了窟窿，反而一跃而起，继续斗争，更显示了她的顽强斗志。剧本在这里既令人信服地描写了新工人被争取过来了，告诉观众东洋大板完全失败了，又突出地描写了共产党员卢志英的性格。
    正像许多优秀的戏曲传统剧目一样，扬剧“黄浦江激流”在全剧中，在各个场子中，都有几处分外突出、精彩，可以令人细细回味的地方。如果说这个戏真像一条激流，那么，这条激流中还有许多个惊人的洪峰。以卢志英来说，就有好几处永远使人难忘的描写。像揭穿东洋大板买人纵火的描写，本来就是大快人心的一件事：东洋大板向群众说，现已查明纵火的是罢工工人代表，已经逮捕，希望“好”工人一起复工；但他却没料到，他们虽然逮捕了老孙等人，可是他收买纵火的工头却也被工人捉住了。卢志英这时上前去揭穿起火真相。这原是很有戏剧性的场面。但聪明的导演们却不满足于此，他们先让东洋大板站在车间的一条长凳上自以为奸计得逞，洋洋得意地劝工人复工，工人问他老孙放火可有证据，他说有证据。这时，激动的卢志英突然一下子跳到大板背后的桌子上，大声指着回身过来的大板鼻子说：“我看你一辈子也拿不出证据！”最后，她命令把放火的工头拉出来，大板只得狼狈而走。大板站在条凳上得意，而卢志英却跳上桌子去揭穿他，这个情景，一反俗语所说，真使人有“魔高一尺，道高一丈”的感觉！卢志英争取新工人以及跟东洋大板面对面的斗争，都是很尖锐的；但是，如果没有抱灯杆、上桌子等等“奇峰突起”般的处理，这个处于尖锐冲突中的正面形象，毕竟不会像现在这样富有光彩。这种处理是根据人物当时的激情寻找出来的，它反过来更增添了对人物激情的描写。
    这个充满扬剧粗犷风格的戏曲剧目，往往能在无戏之处，搞出激动人的好戏来。像第一场四嫂死后，大家决定罢工了。在这里，编导们终于扬弃了他们最初的处理：让在场人物以大合唱表示罢工决心而落幕。现在的处理是这样的：工人们决定罢工了，围着四嫂的尸身静默；同时场面用唢呐由低而高吹小工调的“6”，奏出长声的哀音，配合上大鼓由轻而重由缓而急的咚咚“滚鼓”，唢呐和大鼓越来越高越重越急，仿佛把人们心里的悲愤全都震天动地般地吹打出来。就在这哀乐声中，原先第一个举手赞成罢工的卢志英，低头发现身上还穿着白色的工作围裙，立刻解下来，狠狠往地下一扔，其余的工人见状，也纷纷解扔了围裙。而老孙，——四嫂临终前执手向他“托孤”的老孙，去抱起尸身往车间外走，解了围裙的工人们也跟着缓步而出。扔围裙，这是多大的决心！抱尸而出，这是多深厚的感情！扔围裙随老孙走出车间，表明了大家在党领导下正式罢工了。看起来这是戏曲的“下场”手法，但是，在这样悲愤的打击乐中如此的“下场”，比用一千句合唱来表示工人决心都能说明问题。因为，这是通过配合着音乐的人物行动演出来的戏。而像这种最容易被人搬用非戏曲手法处理得没有戏的地方，这个戏却偏偏作出了动人的效果。又如最后一场：上级党的负责人徐华带来顾正红被惨杀的消息，号召工人们去参加五卅运动。这里，如果是爱用非戏曲手法的编导们，也可能以大合唱结束全剧，或让工人举手赞成，排队浩荡下场。但是，这个戏并不这样处理。它在最后也没忘记再表现一下主要人物老孙，它让老孙闻讯后脱下自己的黑色外衣，撕成黑纱，分发给大家。撕衣、戴纱得要一两分钟时间，但是戏曲的导演们没让观众静静地“看”缠纱而且还让观众“听”：场面用唢呐奏扬剧〔风入松〕曲牌，仍配合上越打越急的“滚鼓”，这样一来，台上就不是冷清清地了；锣鼓敲打出了正在缠纱的剧中人不可压制的愤怒感情，于是，当他们缠好黑纱整队随着徐华穿过高坡而去参加全市示威的时候，真正像黄浦怒潮一样的群众情绪，就在滚鼓最强最急的声音中，传达给台下的观众们了。
    扬剧“黄浦江激流”不仅仅是题材好，思想好，人物好；同时，它的这些好处是用扬剧这种风格粗犷的戏曲形式表达出来的。它在运用戏曲形式反映现代生活的时候，不限于事务主义地，枝节地，琐碎地搬用老戏中某些现成的、合用的东西入剧，它处理这个崭新的重大题材的方法，是根据戏曲的表现方法和技巧，经过一番惨淡经营，融会贯通，“化”出来的。它不仅仅根据戏曲的规律合理地安排了唱和动作，而且它善于运用传统戏曲编、导的构思方法，突出地表现了人物。
    生气勃勃的现代题材，一旦真正运用传统规律来表现的时候，那真是如鱼得水，会现出生龙活虎的姿态！
