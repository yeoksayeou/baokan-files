Impressions of Southern Jiangsu
Guo Yingqiu

Eastward on the Shanghai-Nanjing train, the speeding car flies,
　　Who can match its swiftness!
Furnaces glow with extraordinary brilliance,
　　Canal networks are full of red flags,
Bamboo flourishes, the village appearance changes,
　　Long canals reflect low-hanging sails.
The present always surpasses the past,
　　Don't speak of the Washing Gauze Stream.

In the countryside, late spring, last night the cuckoo cried urgently,
　　Rice seedlings first show a hint of yellow,
Light plowing, spring rain plentiful,
　　Soft wind, rape flowers fragrant.
Silkworm farming is so busy,
　　Pear blossoms riot, wanting to go crazy.
Homes deep in the trees,
　　New walls are rising everywhere.

    苏南纪见
    郭影秋
    沪宁车上东去车如飞，奔驰孰与齐！炉群焕异彩，河网满红旗，竹秀村容改，渠长桅影低。从来今胜昔，莫道浣纱溪。
    农村春暮昨夜鹃啼急，秧针初泛黄，犁轻春雨足，风软菜花香。蚕事忙如许，梨云闹欲狂。人家深树里，处处起新墙。
