Xinhua News Agency, Kishinev, May 15th (TASS): The Soviet government firmly stands on the position of safeguarding peace and consolidating the cause of world peace, Khrushchev said on May 14th at the ceremony of awarding the Order of Lenin to the Moldavian Soviet Republic, held in Kishinev. The Moldavian Republic was awarded the Order of Lenin for its achievements in developing agriculture.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that in recent years, the Soviet Union's prestige on the international stage has unprecedentedly increased.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries are making rapid progress. Khrushchev said that the socialist camp has always been and will always be consolidated, and cannot be breached by the enemy. He expressed confidence that the fraternal relations between socialist countries will develop and strengthen day by day. Khrushchev emphasized that the unity of these countries is one of the powerful sources of the great strength of communism.

　　Khrushchev said that we will do everything possible to make the Geneva conference a success. At the same time, Khrushchev emphasized that the most urgent issue must be resolved first - guaranteeing peace and concluding peace treaties with the two actually existing Germanys.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that it seems that the first meeting may not be able to reach an agreement on many outstanding issues, because both sides insist on different attitudes.

　　When talking about the issue of a unified Germany, Khrushchev once again emphasized that this is a matter for the Germans themselves. The Germans themselves, the government of the German Democratic Republic, and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany should meet and work together to solve these problems.

　　Khrushchev said that the Western countries' governments do not recognize the German Democratic Republic now, but as the saying goes, people will become wiser as time goes by. Without the recognition of Western countries, the German Democratic Republic is still developing smoothly. Some countries that do not yet recognize the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic will eventually come to recognize them sooner or later. Speaking of this, Khrushchev said that it is difficult to imagine what the purpose is of the fact that the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, Brentano, is unwilling to meet with the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Dr. Bolz, in the same hall.

　　Khrushchev added that I think Brentano will have to meet with representatives of the German Democratic Republic sooner or later; there is no escaping it.

　　Khrushchev stressed that if the Western countries do not sign a peace treaty with Germany, then the Soviet Union will sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. He pointed out that I think not only us, but also other socialist countries that once fought against Germany will sign a peace treaty, and possibly some non-socialist countries will also sign a peace treaty.

　　Khrushchev pointed out that the eastern border of the German Democratic Republic borders Poland and Czechoslovakia. After the German Democratic Republic signs treaties with these countries, and obviously with other countries, lasting peace will be guaranteed on this border. Khrushchev said, and this is a big deal.

　　When talking about the West Berlin issue, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's proposal on this issue is the only reasonable path. West Berlin should become a free city. Khrushchev once again reminded that the Soviet Union does not want to interfere in the lives of West Berlin residents. He pointed out that the German Democratic Republic guarantees that the free city can maintain contact with all countries that are willing to interact with its residents.

　　Khrushchev said that we did not allow in the past, and we will not allow now, any ambitions of the Adenauer side towards West Berlin. Adenauer has nothing to do with West Berlin, because Berlin is located in the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

　　Khrushchev once again pointed out that the Soviet Union is willing to maintain good relations with all countries and hopes to develop business contacts and trade. When talking about the visit to Moscow by the British trade delegation led by Trade Minister Eccles, Khrushchev said: "We now have not bad trade contacts, but we hope it will be better. We also hope to expand trade with all countries and expand business contacts."

　　Khrushchev told the leaders of Western countries that the Soviet Union can place large orders to help these countries' industries operate more fully. However, the Soviet Union does not need loans for this reason.

　　Khrushchev added that the Soviet Union will definitely complete and overfulfill its seven-year plan and does not need loans, because this plan is based on its own strength and potential. Khrushchev said that we do not ask for loans, but suggest that Western activists sign mutually beneficial trade agreements.

　　Khrushchev went on to say that we have transformed our country from an economically backward country into the second strongest country in the world, and we have solemnly declared that in the near future we will make our country the most economically prosperous country and the number one strongest country in the world. This means that the Soviet people will have the highest living standards and will live the best life with guarantees in material and spiritual aspects. Khrushchev said that our people, the people of the new society, will be the most secure people.

    赫鲁晓夫谈日内瓦外长会议
    缔结对德和约是最迫切的问题
    绝不允许阿登纳对西柏林的任何野心
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社基什尼奥夫14日讯：苏联政府坚决站在维护和平和巩固世界和平事业的立场上，这是赫鲁晓夫14日在基什尼奥夫举行的授给摩尔达维亚苏维埃共和国列宁勋章的典礼上说的。摩尔达维亚共和国由于在发展农业方面取得成就而荣获列宁勋章。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，最近几年，苏联在国际舞台上的威望空前地提高了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联和社会主义阵营各国正在突飞猛进。赫鲁晓夫说，社会主义阵营过去和将来一直是巩固的，是敌人所无法攻破的。他表示确信，社会主义各国的兄弟关系将日益发展加强。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，这些国家的团结一致是共产主义伟大力量的强大源泉之一。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们要竭尽一切努力使日内瓦会议取得良好结果。同时，赫鲁晓夫强调指出，首先必须解决最迫切的问题——保障和平、同两个实际存在的德国缔结和约。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，看来，第一次会晤未必能就许多悬而未决的问题达成协议，因为一方和另一方都坚持不同的态度。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到统一德国的问题时再次强调指出，这是德国人自己的问题。德国人自己、德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国政府应当会见并共同努力解决这些问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方国家政府现在不承认德意志民主共和国，但是，俗话说得好，随着时间的消逝，人们会变得聪明一些。没有西方国家的承认，德意志民主共和国照样顺利地发展。某些现在还不承认中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的国家迟早总会找上门去承认它们的。谈到这里，赫鲁晓夫说，很难想像，德意志联邦共和国外交部长勃伦塔诺不愿意同德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨博士在一个厅里相见，其目的究竟是什么。
    赫鲁晓夫补充说道，我想，勃伦塔诺早晚总要同德意志民主共和国的代表相见，这是逃避不了的。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，如果西方国家不签署对德和约，那末苏联就将同德意志民主共和国签署和约。他指出，我想，不仅我们，而且其他曾经对德作战的社会主义国家也将签署和约，并且，可能某些非社会主义国家也将签署和约。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，德意志民主共和国的东部边境与波兰和捷克斯洛伐克接壤，德意志民主共和国同这些国家，显然还会同其他国家签署条约之后，在这个边境上将保证持久和平。赫鲁晓夫说，而这是一件大事。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到西柏林问题时说，苏联关于这一问题的建议是唯一合理的道路。西柏林应当成为自由城市。赫鲁晓夫再一次提醒说，苏联不想干涉西柏林居民的生活。他指出，德意志民主共和国保证自由城市可以同愿意与它的居民来往的一切国家保持联系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们过去不允许，现在也不允许阿登纳方面对西柏林的任何野心。阿登纳对西柏林没有任何关系，因为柏林位在德意志民主共和国的领土上。
    赫鲁晓夫再一次指出，苏联愿意同一切国家保持良好关系，希望发展事务联系和进行贸易。赫鲁晓夫谈到以贸易大臣埃克尔斯为首的英国贸易代表团访问莫斯科时说：“我们现在有不坏的贸易联系，但是，我们希望它更好一些。我们还希望扩大同一切国家的贸易，扩大事务联系。”
    赫鲁晓夫对西方国家领导人说，苏联可以大批地订货，以便帮助这些国家工业能更多地开工。不过苏联并不因此而需要贷款。
    赫鲁晓夫补充说，苏联一定能完成和超额完成自己的七年计划，而且不需要贷款，因为这个计划是以本国的力量和潜力为依据的。赫鲁晓夫说，我们不要求贷款，而是建议西方国家活动家签订互利的贸易协定。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们已经把自己的国家由一个经济上落后的国家变成了世界第二强国，而且我们已经庄严声明，在不久的将来要使我国成为经济上最富强的国家，成为世界第一强国。这就是说，苏联人民将有最高的生活水平，将过着在物质和精神方面有保障的最美好的生活。赫鲁晓夫说，我们的人、新社会的人将是最有保障的人。
