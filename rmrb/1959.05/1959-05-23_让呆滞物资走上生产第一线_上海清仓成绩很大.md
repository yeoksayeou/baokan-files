Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 22nd: The mass movement to clear warehouses, recently launched in Shanghai, has achieved great results. Since the movement began on April 19th, all factories, commercial enterprises, basic construction units, and transportation departments in the city have mobilized their workers to inspect warehouses. Currently, relevant leading departments are, in accordance with the principle of clearing while adjusting, rapidly allocating surplus and idle materials to key production and key construction posts.

The results of this inventory clearance show that the potential of materials scattered in various corners is not small, but has great potential. As of the 19th, the city had already transferred approximately 12,000 tons of various ordinary and high-quality steel products and more than 600 tons of non-ferrous metals, meeting the urgent needs of key units manufacturing rolling mills, mining, power stations, coal washing and coking, irrigation and drainage equipment, etc.

The Xiesheng Electric Motor Factory cleared out more than 2,000 electricity meters, while the Zhongnan Electric Motor Factory in the same district and industry was affected in its production due to a shortage of these meters. The electricity meters from Xiesheng Factory solved Zhongnan Factory's urgent need. Huatong Switch Factory, which produces switches for power stations, mines, and iron and steel enterprises across the country, transferred 300 tons of various ferrous and non-ferrous metals in two days. Their 110,000-volt multi-oil circuit breakers are important equipment urgently needed for the construction of large-scale power stations, and they urgently needed channel steel in production, which was basically met through this adjustment. While transferring in large quantities, this factory also transferred out many of its surplus materials to support others in overcoming difficulties.

Many factories not only supported others, but also discovered many materials that were currently urgently needed for their own production through inventory clearance.

The inventory clearance movement is also a profound ideological education movement. Through the movement, the communist spirit of considering the overall situation and subordinating oneself to the whole was greatly promoted among the vast number of cadres and workers. They carefully investigated, reported, and actively obeyed allocation. Initially, some leading personnel and supply and marketing personnel of some enterprises had the idea of ​​"fear of being transferred away," feeling that "it is really reluctant to transfer away the materials that I worked so hard to get." After repeated ideological education on the concept of "the whole country as one chessboard" by party organizations at all levels and the organization of mass airing of views and debates, this idea was quickly overcome. The China Electric Factory cleared out two electric motors, which were important equipment that the supply and marketing personnel had painstakingly purchased. Because they would not be needed temporarily in the second quarter, some advocated transferring them out, while others were reluctant. Just when the two sides were arguing, the factory director stated that he must report them as "adjustment materials" to support the key needs of the country.

Through this inventory clearance, the staff of each enterprise have a better understanding of the raw material situation of their own enterprise, and have also discovered many problems in raw material management, and are preparing to further organize the masses to fully air their views and improve and establish management systems.

### 让呆滞物资走上生产第一线  上海清仓成绩很大

    让呆滞物资走上生产第一线
    上海清仓成绩很大
    据新华社上海22日电　上海最近在全市范围内掀起的清理仓库的群众运动，已经取得了很大成绩。这一运动从4月19日展开以后，全市所有的工厂、商业、基本建设、交通运输部门，都发动职工清查了仓库。目前，各有关领导部门正根据边清理边调剂的精神，把清出的多余和呆滞物资，迅速调配到重点生产和重点建设岗位上去。
    从这次清仓的成绩来看，分散在各个角落的物资潜力不是很小，而是大有可为。到十九日为止，全市已经调剂了各种普通钢材的优质钢材约一万二千吨，有色金属六百多吨，满足了很多制造轧钢、采矿、电站、洗煤炼焦、排灌等设备的重点单位的紧急需要。
    协成电机厂清出了二千多只电度表，而在同一个区同一个行业中的中南电机厂，却因为缺少这种电度表影响了生产。协成厂的电度表就解决了中南厂的急需。为各地电站、矿山、钢铁企业生产开关的华通开关厂，在两天之中就调进了各种黑色金属和有色金属三百吨。他们制造的十一万伏多油式油开关，是建设大型电站迫切需要的重要设备，生产中急需槽钢，这次通过调剂就基本上满足了需要。这个厂在大量调入的同时，也调出不少自己多余的材料，支援别人克服困难。
    许多厂不仅支援了别人，通过清仓也发现了很多本企业生产中当前急需的材料。
    清仓运动也是一个深刻的思想教育运动。通过运动广大干部和职工群众照顾大局、服从整体的共产主义风格大大发扬了。他们认真的清查、上报，积极服从调配。开始，有一部分企业的领导人员和供销人员，存在“怕调走”的思想，觉得“自己千辛万苦搞来的材料，调走了真舍不得”。经过各级党组织反复进行“全国一盘棋”的思想教育和组织群众鸣放辩论以后，这种思想很快得到了克服。中国电工厂清查出两台电动机，是供销人员好不容易采购来的重要设备。由于他们第二季度还暂时用不到，有人就主张调出，有人舍不得。正当双方争论不休的时候，厂长表示一定要上报为“调剂物资”，支援国家重点需要。
    通过这次清仓，各个企业的工作人员对本企业的原料材料情况心中更为有数，并且发现了很多原料材料管理上的问题，准备进一步组织群众大鸣大放，健全和建立管理制度。
