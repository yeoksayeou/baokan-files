Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at Beijing Airport to bid farewell to the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation.
　　Dear Comrade Münnich Ferenc, dear comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation:
　　Now Comrade Münnich Ferenc and the comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation are about to leave our country. We bid farewell to you with infinite reluctance.
　　Dear comrades, although you have only stayed in our country for a short eleven days, your warm visit has made the flowers of friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people, growing in the fertile soil of internationalism, bloom even more vividly. Yesterday, our two governments signed the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which is a symbol of a new development in the friendly unity and mutual assistance between the two peoples. The Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation will not only encourage the Chinese and Hungarian peoples who are marching on the road to socialism, but will also help strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and safeguard the struggle for world peace.
　　Dear Comrade Münnich Ferenc and all the comrades of the delegation, at this moment of parting, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, to express our deep gratitude to you once again, thank you for bringing the brotherly friendship of the Hungarian people to the Chinese people, and also please convey the love and respect of the Chinese people for the fraternal Hungarian people to them. We sincerely congratulate the Hungarian people on their continuous and greater victories in the cause of socialist construction and safeguarding world peace in their motherland.
　　Wish you a safe journey!
　　Goodbye!

　　在北京机场欢送匈牙利党政代表团
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社7日讯　中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来在北京机场欢送匈牙利党政代表团的讲话。亲爱的明尼赫·费伦茨同志，亲爱的匈牙利党政代表团的全体同志们：
    现在明尼赫·费伦茨同志和匈牙利党政代表团的同志们就要离开我国了，我们怀着无限惜别的心情来欢送你们。
    亲爱的同志们，你们在我国虽然只停留了短短的十一天，但是通过你们的盛情访问，使生长在国际主义肥沃土壤上的中匈人民友谊的花朵开得更为鲜艳了。昨天我们两国政府签订了中匈友好合作条约，这是两国人民友好团结和互助关系新的发展的标志。中匈友好合作条约不仅将鼓舞在社会主义大道上迈进的中匈两国人民，并且将有助于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和维护世界和平的斗争。
    亲爱的明尼赫·费伦茨同志和代表团全体同志们，在这临别的时刻请允许我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，再一次向你们表示深切的谢意，感谢你们远道带来了匈牙利人民对中国人民的兄弟友情，同时也请你们把中国人民对兄弟般的匈牙利人民的热爱和敬意带给他们。我们衷心地祝贺匈牙利人民在祖国的社会主义建设和维护世界和平的事业中不断地获得更大的胜利。
    祝你们一路平安！
    再见！
