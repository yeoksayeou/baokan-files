　　Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 30th – Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant achieved a double leap in output and quality during Red May. As of the 28th, the utilization coefficient of the plant's high furnaces reached a high level of 2.442, exceeding the 2.3 competition target they proposed to high furnace workers across the country. Due to the increased utilization coefficient, the plant completed its May pig iron production plan on the 28th, with an average daily output increase of over 8% compared to April. All pig iron met quality standards, creating the best pig iron quality performance this year.
　　In May, Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant mobilized the masses to discuss production plans and various measures, and further launched a high-quality, high-yield competition. At the beginning of the month, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, they further improved the raw material conditions of the high furnaces, changing the method of using coke in the high furnaces from mixed large and small pieces to using it in separate furnaces and grades, greatly increasing the output of the high furnaces. The workers also enlarged the tuyeres of the high furnaces into a trumpet shape, thereby improving the gas distribution inside the furnace and further promoting the smelting intensity. In order to ensure quality, they established a quality management system at the beginning of the month, with the factory and workshops setting up quality inspection work groups, and the work sections and teams setting up quality inspectors. They also conducted quality awareness education among all employees, so a quality-conscious atmosphere emerged throughout the plant. (Attached picture)
　　Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant completed its monthly pig iron task three days and four hours ahead of schedule on the 28th of this month. The average utilization coefficient reached 2.443. The average daily output increased by 8% compared to April. The qualification rate was 100%. This is the youth high furnace tapping iron.

    本钢一厂高炉创生产新纪录
    利用系数达到二·四四二生铁质量全部合乎标准
    新华社本溪30日电　本溪第一钢铁厂在红五月里产量质量双双跃进。到28日止，全厂高炉利用系数达到了二点四四二的高水平，超过了他们向全国高炉职工提出的二点三的竞赛指标。由于利用系数提高，全厂在28日就完成了5月份的生铁产量计划，日产量平均比4月份提高8％以上。全部生铁都合乎质量标准，创造了今年以来生铁质量的最好成绩。
    本溪第一钢铁厂在5月份发动群众讨论了生产计划和各种措施，更加深入地开展了优质高产竞赛。他们在月初根据苏联专家的建议，进一步改善了高炉原料条件，将高炉使用焦炭的办法，由原来的大小块混合改为分炉分级使用，大大提高了高炉产量。职工们又把高炉的风口改大为喇叭形，从而改善了炉内瓦斯分布状况，促使冶炼强度进一步提高。为了保证质量，他们在月初健全了质量管理制度，厂和车间设立质量检查工作组，工段和小组设立质量检查员，并在全体职工中进行了重视质量的教育，因此全厂出现了重视质量的风气。（附图片）
    本溪第一钢铁厂于本月28日提前三天零四小时完成全月生铁任务。利用系数平均达到2.443。日产量平均比4月份提高8％。合格率为100％。这是青年高炉在出铁。
