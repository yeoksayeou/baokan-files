Contract Output Quotas Must Be Implemented
Lin Yizhou

Leading agricultural production and organizing the continued great leap forward in agricultural production this year requires grasping many aspects; a very important one is contract output quotas.

Contract output quota is a kind of agreement, a kind of contract, between the commune and the production team, and its members; it is also an important method for promoting agricultural production development. The commune formulates the agricultural income distribution plan according to the contract output quota figures. Accounting units below the commune level (production brigades or production teams) use the contract output quota figures to control various income and expenditure items under their management. Most or almost all of the portion exceeding the contract output quota belongs to the commune members of the contract output quota unit. The contract output quota figures are also an important basis for the state to assign agricultural product purchase tasks. The formulation of the contract output quota figures makes the outline of the year's production and distribution clearer, more directly links the increase in production and the increase in producers' income, and better combines the interests of the state, the collective interests of the commune, and the individual interests of the commune members. This clear and understandable production and distribution relationship, as reflected through the contract output quota, is familiar to the peasants and known to every household. According to past experience, as long as it is handled well, it will greatly promote production.

Whether the contract output quota problem is solved well depends on whether the contract output quota target is implemented. The contract output quota target should not be conjured up by a few people sitting in a room. When determining the contract output quota target, one must not use wishes as a basis or replace reality with feelings; one must not think that the higher the target, the better; one cannot set the target at 1,000 jin, 1,500 jin, or even more for a per-mu yield that can only actually reach 500 jin, which is actually impossible to achieve. A realistic investigation and analysis must be carried out on the actual situation of how much the yield was on various lands in the local area last year, how much the yield increased last year compared with the previous year, how much the yield can increase this year, what reliable measures are in place to increase production, and so on. On the basis of realistically estimating the objective possibilities of local manpower, material resources, and financial resources, the subjective initiative of people should be fully utilized; both favorable conditions and actually existing difficult conditions must be seen, and ways to overcome the difficulties must be studied so that the planned targets are as consistent as possible with reality or close to reality. To achieve this, there must be full discussion with the masses to make a joint decision. Because the general public's understanding of the actual conditions of the local land and production is clearer than that of the cadres. Of course, there are also some people with conservative views among them, but, in general, the peasants' estimates of what measures to take for the various types of land they cultivate and the yield that may be achieved as a result are more practical and reliable. Moreover, to overcome some of the conservative views among the masses, it is only possible to rely on practical experience, first of all, on the results of a batch of experiments.

Only through discussion with the masses can the demands of the masses be reflected and collective wisdom be concentrated, so that the contract output quota target becomes a target jointly decided by the leadership and the masses. In this way, the contract output quota target can be truly grasped by the masses, truly become the goal of the actual actions of the masses, and can encourage their drive and stimulate their production enthusiasm. Whether the contract output quota target can be achieved depends entirely on the hands of the commune members, and entirely on the size of their drive and the level of their enthusiasm. Experience has proved that plans and targets that the masses do not agree with or accept, and are forcibly implemented, are often unworkable and unachievable.

Some people worry that in this way, the masses will lower the target too much. Of course, this possibility also exists. The contradiction between the small collective and the large collective is a problem that will take a considerable amount of time to gradually resolve. This contradiction is sometimes manifested as parochialism in the small collective and sometimes as excessive centralization in the large collective. In the current situation, attention must be paid to the fact that some higher-level cadres are adding layers to the production targets, making excessive demands, and at the same time, not taking enough care of the interests of the small collective, and excessively centralizing the leadership of production. Therefore, it must be stated that a contract output quota target cannot be considered valid if the masses do not agree with it. The small collective and the large collective are consistent in their fundamental interests, and this consistency of interests is the basis for them to discuss problems together, and on this basis, it is possible to reach an agreement that everyone is relatively satisfied with.

There is a problem of leaving room for maneuver in the contract output quota. Now, in many places, when setting the contract output quota, the contract output quota target is set lower than the actual possible yield (for example, 10% to 20% lower), leaving room for overproduction for the contract output quota production team or production team, so that they have a real possibility of overproduction, and therefore have a reward to gain, and gain greater benefits from increased production. We believe that this method is completely correct, because doing so can greatly encourage and stimulate the enthusiasm of the peasant masses to increase production. Sincerely caring about the interests of the masses, and always thinking about making our policies and measures suitable to the needs of the masses, is a principle that our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always adhered to; we must conscientiously implement this principle when determining contract output quota targets and similar issues. As for the unreasonable, parochial ideas that a few or individual people among the masses may have, such as the lower the target, the better, and the more room left, the better, these can be overcome through common consultation and discussion, on the basis of the masses' ideological understanding of the consistency of the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. The tendency to underestimate the actual possibility of increasing production and to set the target too low, thereby relaxing production measures, must also be prevented and corrected as much as possible.

We emphasize that the contract output quota target should be realistic in order to put our feet on solid ground and build the production leap forward on a solid and reliable foundation. Only in this way can our work be guaranteed, and can grassroots cadres and commune members truly be determined and confident to complete and overfulfill the set targets. The more realistic the target, the stronger their determination and confidence will be, and the greater the enthusiasm for the leap forward will be. Conversely, if it exceeds actual possibilities, and they have no confidence at all, and the masses do not believe it at all, this has nothing to do with a real leap forward. Targets that are too high and divorced from reality will not only fail to encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses, but will also frustrate the production enthusiasm of the masses. Because if the target is set too high, no one can achieve it, it is just talk; if it is set realistically, it can be achieved through effort, and the masses will take it seriously and strive to achieve it.

After the contract output quota target is implemented, we will have a reliable minimum guarantee for the yield, and the absolute figures for state purchase, commune accumulation, commune member distribution, etc., can be estimated more realistically. In this way, cadres have a clear idea and work proactively; the masses have clear goals to strive for, work hard, and many things will be much easier to handle. In this way, the realization of our entire planned target will be more guaranteed.

    包产一定要落实
    林一舟
    领导农业生产，组织今年农业生产的继续跃进，要抓许多环节；其中很重要的一环，是包产。
    包产，是公社和生产队、社员之间的一种协议，一种合同；也是促进农业生产发展的一个重要方法。公社根据包产数字拟定农业方面的收益分配方案。公社以下的核算单位（生产大队或者生产队）根据包产数字来支配由自己管理的各种收支。超过包产的部分，绝大部分或几乎全部归包产单位的社员群众所有。包产数字又是国家分派农产品征购任务的一个重要依据。通过包产数字的拟定，就使一年的生产和分配的轮廓更加明朗化，使生产的增加和生产者收入的增加更直接地联系起来，使国家利益、公社集体利益和社员个人利益更好地结合起来。通过包产体现出来的这种清楚明白的生产和分配的关系，农民熟悉、妇孺皆知。根据过去的经验，只要处理得好，就会对生产起重大的推动作用。
    包产问题解决得好不好，关键在于包产指标是否落实。包产指标不应当是少数人坐在房子里空想出来的。在确定包产指标的时候，决不能以愿望作为根据，以感想代替实际；不能以为指标定得愈高愈好，不能把亩产在实际上只能达到五百斤的，定成一千斤，一千五百斤，甚至更多，实际上做不到。必须对去年当地各种土地上的产量多少，去年比前年增产多少，今年能够增产多少，有什么可靠的增产措施，等等方面的实际情况，进行实事求是的调查和分析。在切实估计到当地人力、物力、财力的客观可能性的基础上，充分发挥人的主观能动作用；既要看到各种有利条件，又要看到实际存在的困难条件，并要研究克服困难的办法，使计划指标尽可能地符合实际或接近实际。要做到这一点，就必须同群众进行充分的讨论，共同作出决定。因为一般群众对当地土地和生产上各种实际条件的了解，比干部是会要清楚些。当然，其中也有某些有保守观点的人，但是，一般说来，农民群众对自己耕种的各类土地要采取什么措施以及因此可能达到的产量的估计，是比较实际，比较可靠的。而且，要克服群众中的某些保守观点，也只有依靠实际的经验，首先是依靠一批试验的结果。
    经过群众讨论，才能反映群众要求，集中集体智慧，使包产指标成为领导与群众共同决定的指标。这样，包产指标才能真正为群众所掌握，真正成为群众实际行动的奋斗目标，才能鼓舞他们的干劲，激励他们的生产积极性。包产指标能否达到，全靠社员的双手，全在于他们干劲的大小和积极性的高低。经验证明：凡是群众不同意、不接受的计划和指标，勉强实行，硬着来做，往往是行不通、办不到的。
    有人担心，这样一来，群众会把指标压得很低。当然，这种可能也是存在的。小集体和大集体的矛盾，这是需要相当时间才能逐步解决的问题。这种矛盾，有时表现为小集体的本位主义，有时表现为大集体的过分集中。当前情况必须注意的，是某些上级的干部对生产指标层层加码，要求过高，同时，对小集体的利益照顾不够，对生产的领导过分集中。因此，必须说明：包产指标如群众不同意就不能算数。小集体和大集体在根本利益上是一致的，这种利益的一致性是它们共同商量问题的基础，在这个基础上是能够达成一个大家都比较满意的协定的。
    包产中有一个留有余地的问题。现在很多地方在包产的时候，把包产指标定得比实际可能达到的产量低一些（例如低10％到20％），给包产的生产小队或者生产队留下超产的余地，使他们真正有可能超产，因而有奖可得，从增产中得到较大的实惠。我们认为这种办法是完全对的，因为这样做，可以大大鼓励和刺激农民群众的增产积极性。切实关心群众的利益，时刻想到使我们的政策措施适合群众的要求，这是我们党和毛泽东同志所一贯坚持的原则；我们必须在确定包产指标这一类的问题上，认真贯彻执行这个原则。至于群众当中有少数或个别的人可能产生的指标愈低愈好、留的余地愈大愈好的、不尽合理的、本位主义的想法，通过共同商量讨论，在群众对国家、集体和个人的利益一致性认识的思想基础上，是可以克服的。对增产的实际可能性估计不足，把指标定得太低，因而使生产措施松懈下来，这种偏向也是要尽可能地防止和纠正的。
    我们强调包产指标要切合实际，也就是为了使自己的两脚踏在实地上，使生产跃进建立在切实可靠的基础上。只有这样，我们的工作才有把握，基层干部和社员群众才会真正下决心、有信心去完成和超额完成所定的指标。指标愈切合实际，他们这种决心和信心也就愈强，跃进的劲头就会更大。相反地，如果超过实际可能，自己根本无把握，群众根本不相信，这同真正的跃进是毫不相干的。过高的指标，脱离实际的指标，不但不能鼓励群众的生产积极性，反而会挫折群众的生产积极性。因为指标定得过高，谁也达不到，只是说说而已；如果定得切合实际，是经过努力可以达到的，群众就会认真对待，争取实现。
    包产指标落实以后，我们对产量就有个最低限度的可靠的把握，国家征购、公社积累、社员分配等等的绝对数字，就可以比较实际地预定下来。这样，干部心中有底，工作主动；群众有明确的奋斗目标，干活有劲，许多事情都会好办得多。这样，我们整个计划指标的实现，就会更有保证。
