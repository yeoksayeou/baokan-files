Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, Stockholm Dispatch: A commentary on the Tibet issue by commentator K. Andersson published in the Swedish "Forest Worker" magazine on April 29th emphasized that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair.

The author said: Hundreds of years ago, Tibet's sovereignty belonged to China. Foreign aggressors took advantage of the weakness of China's central government to invade Tibet, but this does not change the fact that Tibet's sovereignty belongs to China. But the Chinese people have never given up their claim to sovereignty over Tibet. No country has ever recognized an independent Tibet.

The author pointed out: "In 1954, India recognized China's sovereignty over Tibet. In the agreement, the two countries determined to base their relations on the so-called Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As is well known, one of these principles is non-interference in internal affairs. In the Tibetan crisis, those who loudly criticized Nehru's attitude as being too cautious seem to have forgotten that India has no right to interfere in Tibetan affairs."

The author pointed out the darkness and reaction of the Tibetan serf system. He wrote to those who clamored for Tibet's "freedom": "Don't forget, when talking about freedom, people must ask: What kind of freedom and whose freedom?"

### 瑞典“林业工人”杂志指出  西藏主权自古属于中国

　　瑞典“林业工人”杂志指出
    西藏主权自古属于中国
    新华社5日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：瑞典“林业工人”杂志4月29日发表的评论员卡·安德逊评论西藏问题的文章着重指出，西藏问题是中国的内政问题。
    作者说：在几百年前，西藏主权就已隶属中国。外国侵略者乘中国中央政权之虚而侵入西藏，但这并不能改变西藏主权属于中国这一事实。但是中国人从未放弃过对西藏的主权要求。也未曾有任何一个国家承认一个独立的西藏。
    作者指出：“1954年印度承认了中国对西藏的主权。在协定中，两国确定以所谓五项原则作为它们之间的关系基础。如众所知，这些原则之一是互不干涉内政。在西藏危机中，（西方国家）高声批评尼赫鲁的态度过于谨慎的人们，看来是忘记了印度无权干预西藏事务这一点。”
    作者指出了西藏农奴制度的黑暗、反动。它针对那些大嚷西藏“自由”的人们写道：不要忘记，在谈及自由的时候，人们必须要问：什么样的自由和谁的自由？”
