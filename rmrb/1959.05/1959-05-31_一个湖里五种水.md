    A Lake with Five Kinds of Water
    On Kilgin Island in the Barents Sea in northern Soviet Union, there is a small lake. The composition of the lake water is the most peculiar in the world. The lake water is divided into five layers: the first layer is fresh water, formed by melting ice and rain and snow, in which ordinary freshwater fish live; the second layer of water contains trace amounts of salt, containing jellyfish and arthropod crustaceans; the third layer is saltwater, inhabited by small sea fish, anemones, and starfish; the fourth layer of water is red in color, containing many purple bacteria; the fifth layer of water is full of hydrogen sulfide.

    一个湖里五种水
    苏联北部巴伦支海中基利金岛上有一个小湖，湖水的组成是世界上最奇妙的。湖水分五层：第一层是淡水，由融冰和雨雪形成，其中生存着普通的淡水鱼；第二层水中含有微量的盐，内有水母、节肢动物的甲壳纲类动物；第三层是咸海水，生存着小的海鱼、海葵和海星；第四层的水呈红色，内有许多紫细菌；第五层水里充满了硫化氢。
