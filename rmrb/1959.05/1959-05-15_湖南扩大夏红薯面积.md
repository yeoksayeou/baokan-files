Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: While striving for a bumper harvest of rice, Hunan is seizing the season to actively expand the planting of summer sweet potatoes. According to preliminary statistics, the province's summer sweet potato planting area has increased from the original plan of more than 3.77 million mu to more than 4.8 million mu. More than 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been planted throughout the province. Shaoyang Prefecture, which has made rapid progress in sweet potato planting, has completed more than half of its planting plan. At present, various places are actively organizing labor to prepare the soil, apply fertilizer, force seedlings, and seize the opportunity to plant on overcast days.

This year, on the basis of summarizing last year's sweet potato bumper harvest experience, all parts of Hunan have tried every means to use all available land to expand the planting of summer sweet potatoes, and have conscientiously implemented yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing, applying more fertilizer, early planting, and close planting.

The sweet potato planting work in various places is not only progressing quickly, but also the quality is very good. It is understood that more than 40,000 mu already planted in Dongkou County have been inspected in the field, and the survival rate has reached more than 90%. The planting quality of other counties and people's communes is also up to standard, and the survival rate is also very high.

    湖南扩大夏红薯面积
    新华社长沙电　湖南各地在力争水稻丰产的同时，正抓住季节，积极扩种夏红薯。据初步统计，全省夏红薯种植面积已由原计划三百七十七万多亩增加到四百八十多万亩。全省已栽下红薯五十多万亩。红薯栽种进度较快的邵阳专区已完成种植计划一半以上。目前各地正积极组织劳动力整土、施肥、催苗和乘阴天抢种。
    今年湖南各地在总结去年红薯丰产经验的基础上，都千方百计地利用一切空隙土地，扩种夏红薯，并认真贯彻了深耕、多施肥、早插、密植等增产措施。
    各地红薯栽种工作不仅进行得快，而且质量也很好。据了解洞口县已栽下的四万多亩，经过田间检查，成活率达到90％以上。其他各个县和人民公社栽种的质量也都合乎规格，成活率也很高。
