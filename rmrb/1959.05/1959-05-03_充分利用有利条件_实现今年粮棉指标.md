Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

I fully support the central government's policy towards the Tibetan rebel group. We express our great joy at the swift suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and the beginning of a new historical period for the Tibetan people. We express our extreme indignation at the blatant support of the Tibetan rebel group by British imperialism and Indian expansionists, and their arrogant interference in our country's internal affairs. We solemnly warn British imperialism, which is dreaming of aggression, and the Indian expansionists, who are undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples: Tibet has always been an inseparable part of China, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. Your conspiracy to support and exploit the Tibetan rebellion to realize your expansionist ambitions will inevitably be met with a firm rebuff and will never succeed.

Here, on behalf of the 43 million people of Hebei Province, I extend my cordial greetings to the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, who put down the Tibetan rebellion, and to the Tibetan people who assisted in putting down the Tibetan rebellion.

Now, I would like to talk about the issue of continuing to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production in Hebei Province in 1959, based on the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958.

Like all parts of the country, the people of our province, inspired by the general line for building socialism, and after a year of hard work in 1958, achieved a great leap forward in agricultural production. The total grain output of the province increased from 20 billion catties in 1957 to 40 billion catties; cotton increased from 620 million catties to 1.18 billion catties. Calculated on the basis of the total value of agricultural and sideline production, it increased by 83 percent compared with 1957. This has not only greatly changed the serious grain shortage in Hebei Province, but also strongly supported the development of industry and enhanced the material strength for carrying out agricultural capital construction and further improving agricultural conditions.

Last year's great leap forward in agricultural production revealed to us the objective possibility of achieving agricultural production increases before the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification in our country. The facts of the great leap forward shattered the view that agricultural production could not grow at a large rate, which many people had always held, broke superstitions, and liberated thinking. Intensive cultivation based on the comprehensive application of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture (soil, fertilizer, water, seed, close planting, protection, management, and tools), is the basic experience and basic law of current agricultural production. Many cadres and the masses have deeply realized that our experience is extremely valuable. The correct application and development of these experiences will bring a new leap forward in agricultural production this year and create more conditions for the further development of the entire economic construction cause.

What is particularly worth pointing out is that, driven by last year's great leap forward movement in agriculture, and on the basis of the increased socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, the people's commune movement was realized. In turn, it promoted the development of the great leap forward movement in production. The mass steel production campaign and the deep plowing campaign in the second half of last year were inseparable from the establishment of the people's communes. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Under the conditions of our country, it is not only the best form to promote the continued development of productive forces and accelerate socialist construction, but also the best form for the future transition of the entire rural area from socialist collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialist society to communist society."

On the basis of the great victory we achieved in 1958, and after a concrete analysis of various conditions, we have formulated a plan for increasing agricultural production in 1959. According to this plan, the total grain output of our province should strive to reach 60 billion catties this year, and cotton should strive to reach 1.8 billion catties. Compared with last year, grain will increase by 50 percent and cotton by 52.5 percent. This year's total value of agricultural and sideline production will reach 11.29 billion yuan, an increase of 66.7 percent over last year. This planned target is obviously still a great leap forward target. To achieve this target is certainly not easy and requires great effort.

After such a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, is it possible to achieve another great leap forward this year? We have conducted multiple studies and analyses on this issue, and believe that as long as no irresistible natural disasters occur, it is entirely possible to achieve this year's grain and cotton production increase targets, and that there are objective conditions for it.

Soil, Fertilizer, and Water Conditions Are Better Than Last Year

First of all, let's analyze the three conditions of soil, fertilizer, and water, which are of decisive significance for increasing agricultural production.

Looking at the situation of deep plowing of the land, this is fundamentally incomparable to last year. Last year, it was only started as a key task, and only a few advanced counties had cultivated more than 2 million mu. How much was cultivated last winter and this spring? The province has deeply plowed more than 50 million mu of cultivated land, of which more than 18 million mu are wheat fields and more than 32 million mu are spring-sown crop fields, and the rest will also be plowed once. The growth of crops on deeply plowed land is generally good.

Looking at the fertilizer situation, last year, there was generally more topdressing and less base fertilizer, and soil-made fertilizers were just starting to be tested. This year, not only is the quantity of fertilizer no less than last year, but the quality is much better than last year. The amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields throughout the province (including base fertilizer and topdressing) is generally around 10,000 catties per mu, and the amount of fertilizer applied to spring-sown crops can reach around 5,000 catties per mu, of which better pen manure and human waste account for about half, and soil-made fertilizers have greatly increased. This is also incomparable to last year.

Looking at the water conservancy situation, the spring plowing and sowing in our province in 1958 was carried out under the driest conditions in nearly 30 years. At that time, the area of ​​irrigated land in the province was only 26 million mu, and most of the spring-sown crops were planted by carrying water and using residual moisture. However, the drought promoted the development of a large-scale water conservancy construction movement. Within a year, through the construction of reservoirs, the opening of canals, and the drilling of machine wells, the irrigated area has increased from 26 million mu to more than 90 million mu. The large-scale water conservancy movement last year not only increased the irrigated area a lot, but also enhanced the ability to prevent waterlogging. Although some water conservancy projects still need to be further processed and improved to fully exert their benefits, currently more than 60 million mu of land can be irrigated, which means that the water conservancy conditions during the sowing season this year are more than twice as good as last year. Water conservancy projects that have not yet exerted their benefits are being renovated, and new water conservancy projects are still being carried out intensively. If it is said that a great leap forward was achieved under the drought conditions of last year, then under the greatly improved water conservancy conditions this year, this cannot be said to be one of the fundamental favorable conditions for realizing this year's great leap forward in agriculture.

Cultivation Technology Has Also Improved Compared to Last Year

Secondly, in terms of cultivation technology, there was a wealth of successful experience last year, and this experience has been further promoted and adopted this year. Among them, what has a significant effect on increasing production is the conversion of farmland into gardens. The so-called "gardenization" is the comprehensive application of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture to the fields, from land preparation and sowing to management and harvesting, implementing a complete set of intensive cultivation. This was created by a few counties with more advanced cultivation technology, such as Anguo, Gaocheng, and Zhengding. Due to the conversion of farmland into gardens, compared with land with the same soil conditions, the yield is one to several times higher. This year, gardenization has spread beyond the scope of a few advanced counties and some advanced communes, from more than 2 million mu to more than 30 million mu. We are specifically summarizing the experience of gardenization in order to further improve its quality and make it more scientific.

The Area of ​​High-Yield Fields Has Increased Greatly

Thirdly, the area of ​​high-yield fields has greatly increased, which is an extremely important condition for realizing this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. Last year, the province had about 5 million mu of experimental fields and high-yield fields, mostly scattered and small. This year, it has developed to more than 30 million mu, mostly contiguous and large. There are more than 10 million mu of wheat high-yield fields throughout the province. Due to the use of last year's high-yield field experience, wheat seedlings generally grow well, further demonstrating the superiority of high-yield fields. Other high-yield fields such as cotton, oil crops, and vegetable crops cover 20 million mu, and corresponding measures are being taken. Based on last year's experience, it is estimated that it is possible to obtain 40 to 50 percent of the total output on the 30 percent of the arable land for food crops that is high-yield fields.

While systematically promoting and expanding high-yield fields, the work of strengthening the management of ordinary fields cannot be ignored. It is necessary to fully exploit the potential for increasing production in ordinary fields and strive to increase yields. Generally speaking, this year's efforts in ordinary fields are much greater and better than last year.

The Planting, Management, and Growth of Wheat Are Also Better Than Last Year

When we analyzed whether we could leap forward this year, we also compared the planting, management, and growth of wheat this year with last year. The wheat in 1958 was planted more roughly than this year and suffered from drought, but it achieved a great harvest after strengthening management, and the total output reached 4.88 billion catties, an increase of 40 percent over 1957. This year's wheat was planted after the collectivization of the communes. In the 35 million mu of wheat fields, more than half were planted on land that had been deeply plowed by more than one foot; the rest were also deepened compared to previous years. The base fertilizer for 80 percent of the wheat fields this year is doubled compared to last year's wheat, generally at 6,000 to 7,000 catties. The management work is also much stronger than last year. The people's communes in various wheat-producing areas have organized wheat professional teams to be responsible for management, providing water when needed and fertilizer when needed. For example, Cang County, although close to the Grand Canal, had never watered wheat in the past, but this year 400,000 mu of wheat have been generally watered two to three times. Judging from the current growth of wheat, the seedlings are strong, taller than in previous years, and all are green. In many areas, this year's third-class seedlings are no less than last year's medium wheat.

When comparing this year's and last year's leap forward conditions, it is also necessary to specifically point out two points: First, due to the great development of industry last year, industrial support for commune production will be greatly strengthened; at the same time, the state's economic support for production units with backward production conditions will also greatly exceed last year. More importantly, the people's communes in our province are undergoing rectification in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Not only have various systems and the relationship between cadres and the masses in terms of management and operation been greatly improved, but also the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the masses have been greatly improved. The poor organization and management of labor, certain egalitarian tendencies, and wasteful phenomena that once occurred in some areas when the people's communes were first established last fall have been corrected. After rectification, the people's communes will further exert their advantages. This is a condition that was not fully met last year. Commune members said: With the commune's rectification, our production enthusiasm is even greater and higher. The reason why we have a strong confidence in realizing this year's great leap forward is precisely because the members of the people's communes have such confidence.

Grasp Various Measures and Promote the Great Leap Forward Movement

It can be seen from the above situation that the conditions for this year's great leap forward in agricultural production are much better than last year. As long as we fully utilize these favorable conditions, correctly apply the existing experience, adhere to putting politics in command, and strengthen ideological work, it is entirely possible to realize this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. Are there any difficulties? There are still many difficulties, such as the shortage of rural labor, especially the fact that we cannot effectively control natural disasters, which requires us to redouble our efforts and continue to take various necessary measures. Currently, we are tightly grasping the following points to lead and promote the great leap forward movement: 1. Grasp production and the masses' lives. In terms of production, the current focus is on strengthening wheat management, adding fertilizer and water, striving to eliminate third-class wheat, and preventing first-class wheat from lodging. Make full preparations for disasters such as drought, flood, wind, hail, and pests, and take measures to minimize the degree of production reduction caused by disasters. Currently, some areas in our province have shown signs of drought, and we are using existing water conservancy conditions to carry out the fight against drought. Spring sowing is being intensified, not only to complete it in a timely manner, but also to ensure quality; especially for various spring-sown crops, it is necessary to carry out close planting in accordance with local conditions, actively promote successful experience, and not rush to promote those experiments that have not yet been successful. In arranging the lives of the masses, the current main task is to do a good job in grain supply in areas where production was reduced due to disasters last year, and implement a system of work and rest to ensure the commune members' vigorous combat effectiveness. 2. Grasp tool reform, manufacturing, and improvement of labor organization. On the one hand, it is necessary to intensify the manufacture of various urgently needed agricultural tools and ordinary agricultural tools, rush to manufacture power-driven water-lifting machinery, and on the other hand, continue to promote the successful experience of tool reform to improve labor efficiency. For the arrangement of rural labor, we have determined that no less than 80 percent should be used for agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries). At the same time, in the process of rectification, we strive to further improve the labor organization, and pay special attention to establishing and improving the production responsibility system. 3. Carry out a democratic movement to improve agricultural technology and fully implement the Eight-Point Charter. The reform of agricultural technology should be closely integrated with the existing experience of the local masses and should be promoted only after successful experiments. Therefore, it is necessary to further promote the experience of the "three-in-one combination of local and foreign experts, cadres, and the masses." Important technical measures cannot be decided only by a few people, and special attention should be paid to listening to the opinions of experienced old farmers and decided upon by everyone's consultation. 4. Carry out a high-yield competition movement to ensure high yields and good harvests. In the competition movement, fully utilize last year's experience, implement the spirit of continuous revolution, wave after wave, one climax after another. Here, special attention should be paid to preventing the occurrence of formalism; timely evaluation and inspection should be carried out, and vigorous assistance should be given to backward production units to catch up with advanced production units. In the distribution of benefits, implement the principle of distribution according to work and exchange at equal value, combine strengthening political and ideological work with caring for the material interests of commune members, so as to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

Implementing the mass line method of work is our basic guarantee for achieving last year's great leap forward. In last year's large-scale mass movement, the broad masses of cadres, including commune cadres, gained rich experience in implementing the mass line in various tasks. This year, they will better correctly combine centralized leadership with the large-scale mass movement. They will better carry forward the style of the mass line, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work to realize the glorious task of this year's great leap forward in agriculture.

Under the leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of people and cadres in our province are determined to hold high the red flag of the general line and strive to be at the forefront in the struggle to complete and overfulfill the 1959 agricultural production plan.

    充分利用有利条件　实现今年粮棉指标
    刘子厚代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理所作的“政府工作报告”，以及李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    我完全拥护中央对西藏叛国集团所采取的方针。我们对于迅速粉碎西藏叛乱，对于西藏人民新的历史时期的开始，表示极大的高兴；对于英帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子，明目张胆地支持西藏叛乱集团，狂妄地干涉我国内政，表示极大的愤慨。我们严正地警告做着侵略好梦的英帝国主义和破坏中印两国人民友谊的印度扩张主义分子：西藏从来就是中国不可分割的一部分，平息西藏叛乱完全是中国的内政，绝不容许任何外人的干涉。你们支持和利用西藏叛乱实现扩张野心的阴谋，必然要遭到坚决的回击，是永远不能得逞的。
    这里，我代表河北省四千三百多万人民，谨向平定西藏叛乱的人民解放军西藏军区部队，和协助平定西藏叛乱的西藏人民，致以亲切的慰问。
    下面我想谈一下河北省在一九五八年农业生产大跃进的基础上，继续争取一九五九年农业生产大跃进的问题。
    和全国各地一样，我省人民在建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，经过一九五八年一年的奋战，取得了农业生产的大跃进。全省粮食总产量由一九五七年的二百亿斤增到四百亿斤；棉花由六点二亿斤增到十一点八亿斤。以农副业总产值计算，比一九五七年增长了百分之八十三。这样一来，不仅大大改变了河北省严重缺粮的状况，而且有力地支持了工业的发展，增强了进行农业基本建设、进一步改善农业状况的物质力量。
    去年农业生产的大跃进，给我们揭示出了我国在农业机械化、电气化以前实现农业增产的客观可能性。大跃进的事实，打破了许多人一直认为农业生产不可能以较大比例增长的观点，破除了迷信，解放了思想。以土、肥、水种、密、保、管、工农业“八字宪法”综合运用为基础的精耕细作，是当前农业生产的基本经验和基本规律。许多干部和群众已深刻体会到我们所取得的经验是极可贵的。对这些经验的正确运用和发展，将给今年的农业生产带来新的跃进，并为整个经济建设事业的进一步发展创造更多的条件。
    尤其值得指出的，是在去年农业大跃进运动的推动下，在广大农民社会主义觉悟提高的基础上，实现了人民公社化。它反过来又推动了生产大跃进运动的发展。去年后半年出现的大搞钢铁运动，大搞深翻地运动等等，是和人民公社的建立分不开的。正如周总理在报告中指出的：“在我国条件下，它不仅是推动生产力继续向前发展、加速社会主义建设的最好形式，而且是将来全国农村从社会主义集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，从社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式。”
    我们在一九五八年取得的巨大胜利的基础上，经过对各方面条件的具体分析，制定了一九五九年农业增产的计划。根据这个计划，我省今年粮食总产量要争取达到六百亿斤，棉花争取达到十八亿斤。和去年相比，粮食增长百分之五十，棉花增长百分之五十二点五。今年农副业总产值将达到一百一十二点九亿元，比去年增长百分之六十六点七。这个计划指标显然仍是一个大跃进的指标。实现这个指标，当然不是轻而易举的，必须付出极大的努力。
    在一九五八年农业生产那样的大跃进之后，今年是不是可能又实现这样一个大跃进呢？对于这个问题，我们曾经进行了多次的研究和分析，认为只要不发生不可抗拒的自然灾害，实现今年的粮棉增产指标是完全可能的，是有它的客观条件的。
    土、肥、水的条件比去年好
    首先，从土、肥、水这三个对农业增产具有决定意义的条件来分析一下。
    从土地的深翻情况看，这是去年根本比不上的。去年才开始重点进行，只是少数先进县份搞了二百多万亩。去冬今春搞了多少呢？全省深翻的耕地就有五千多万亩，其中小麦地深翻了一千八百多万亩，春播作物地深翻了三千二百多万亩，其余也都要普耕一遍。经过深翻的土地，农作物的生长情况，一般都是良好的。
    从肥料情况看，去年，一般是追肥多，底肥少，土化肥也才开始试制；今年不仅肥料的数量比去年不少，而且质量要比去年好的多。全省麦田施肥量（包括底肥和追肥）一般的每亩在万斤左右，春播作物施肥量每亩可达五千斤左右，其中较好的圈肥和人粪尿约占一半，土化肥大大增多。这也是去年比不上的。
    从水利情况看，一九五八年我省的春耕播种，是在近三十年来所没有的干旱情况下进行的。那个时候，全省水浇地面积不过二千六百万亩，春播作物大部分是担水点种、借墒抢种的。但干旱却推动了大规模的水利建设运动的开展。一年内，经过修水库、开渠道、打机井，灌溉面积已由二千六百万亩增至九千多万亩。去年大规模的水利运动的开展，不但灌溉面积增加了很多，而且也增强了防涝的能力。虽然有些水利工程还需要进一步加工、提高，才能全部发挥效益，但目前已有六千多万亩地可实行浇灌，这就是说，今年播种期的水利条件比去年好了一倍以上。对尚未发挥效益的水利工程正在整修，新的水利工程还在加紧进行。如果说在去年那种干旱情况下，还实现了大跃进，那么在今年水利条件已经有很大改善的情况下，这对实现今年的农业大跃进，不能说不是带有根本性的有利条件之一。
    耕作技术也比去年提高
    其次，在耕作技术方面，去年有大量成功的经验，对于这些经验，今年已经在进一步推广和采用。其中对增产有显著效果的是耕作的园田化。所谓“园田化”，就是把农业“八字宪法”综合利用于田间，从整地、播种到管理、收获，实行一整套的精耕细作。这是由安国、藁城、正定等耕作技术比较先进的几个县创造的。由于耕作园田化，和同样土质条件的土地比较起来，产量要高一倍到几倍。今年，园田化已经越出少数几个先进县和一些先进公社的范围普遍地推广了，由二百多万亩增到了三千多万亩。我们正在具体总结园田化的经验，以便进一步提高它的质量，使它更加科学化。
    丰产田面积大大增加
    再其次，丰产田的面积大大增加了，这对实现今年的农业生产大跃进，是一个极重要的条件。去年的试验田、丰产田，全省约有五百万亩，多是零星的，小片的，今年已发展到三千多万亩，多是连片的，大面积的。小麦丰产田全省就有一千多万亩，由于运用了去年的丰产田的经验，麦苗生长一般良好，进一步显示了丰产田的优越性。其他如棉花、油料、蔬菜作物等丰产田二千万亩，正在采取相应的措施。根据去年的经验，估计在占粮食作物耕地百分之三十的丰产田面积上，拿到总产量的百分之四十至五十是有可能的。
    在有计划地推广与扩大丰产田的同时，加强对一般田的经营管理工作，也不能忽视。要充分发挥一般田的增产潜力，争取增加产量。一般地说，今年对一般田下的力量，比去年也大得多，好得多。
    小麦的种植、管理、生长情况也比去年好
    我们在分析今年能不能跃进的时候，也曾把今年小麦的种植、管理、生长情况和去年比较了一下。一九五八年的小麦，种的比今年粗糙，又遭受了干旱的打击，但经过加强管理获得了大丰收，总产量达到四十八点八亿斤，比一九五七年增长百分之四十。今年的小麦是在公社化以后种的，在三千五百万亩麦田中，有半数以上种在了深翻一尺以上的土地上；其余的也都比往年加深了耕层。今年百分之八十的麦田的底肥比去年的小麦增多一倍，一般在六、七千斤。管理工作也比去年强的多。各产麦区人民公社，都组织了小麦专业队负责进行管理，需水给水，需肥给肥。例如沧县，虽然紧靠运河，但过去种麦没有浇过水，今年四十万亩小麦则已普遍浇水二次到三次。从现在小麦生长的情况看，苗株茁壮，比往年高一头，青一色。许多地区今年的三类苗不亚于去年的中等麦。
    对今年和去年的跃进条件在作比较的时候，还需要特别指出两点：一是，由于去年工业的大发展，工业对于公社生产的支持，将有很大的加强；同时，国家对于生产条件落后的生产单位的经济支持，也将大大超过去年。更重要的是，我省人民公社根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神，正在进行整顿，不仅经营管理方面的各项制度和干群关系有很大改善，而且群众的社会主义觉悟和生产的积极性也大大提高了。在去年秋季人民公社刚刚建立的时候，曾经在部分地区一度发生的劳动力的组织管理不善，某些平均主义的倾向，以及铺张浪费现象，已经得到纠正。人民公社经过整顿后，将进一步发挥它的优越性。这是去年所没有完全具备的条件。社员群众说：公社这样一整顿，我们生产的劲头更大更高了。我们对实现今年的大跃进所以抱有坚强的信心，正是由于人民公社的社员们抱有这样的信心。
    抓紧各项措施，推动大跃进运动
    从上面所说的情况看出，今年农业生产大跃进的条件，比去年优越得多。只要我们充分利用这些有利条件，正确运用已有的经验，坚持政治挂帅，加强思想工作，实现今年农业生产大跃进，是完全可能的。有没有困难呢？困难还是很多的，如农村劳力不足，特别是对自然灾害，我们还不能很有效的控制等等，这就需要我们加倍努力，继续采取各种必要的措施。当前，我们正在紧紧抓住以下几点，领导和推动大跃进运动：一、大抓生产和群众生活。在生产上，当前，重点是加强小麦管理，加肥加水，力争消灭三类麦，并防止一类麦的倒伏。对水旱风雹病虫等灾害，要作充分的准备，采取措施，以尽量缩小因灾减产的程度。目前我省有些地区，已呈旱象，我们正在利用已有的水利条件，开展抗旱斗争。春播工作，正在加紧进行，不但要及时完成，并要保证质量；特别是对各种不同的春播作物，要因地制宜的进行密植，积极推广成功的经验，对那些试验还没有成功的，一定不能忙于推广。在安排群众生活上，当前主要的是对去年因灾减产地区作好粮食供应工作，贯彻执行有劳有逸的制度，以保证社员的旺盛的战斗力。二、抓工具改革、制造和改善劳动组织的工作。一方面要加紧制造各种急需的农具和普通农具，赶制动力提水机械，一方面要继续推广成功的工具改革的经验，以提高劳动效率。对农村劳动力的安排，我们确定用于农业方面（包括林、牧、副、渔）的不少于百分之八十。同时在整社当中，力求对劳动组织作进一步改善，特别要注意建立和健全生产责任制。三、开展改进农业技术的民主运动，全面贯彻八字宪法。进行农业技术改革要和当地群众已有的经验密切结合起来，要先经过试验成功，而后推广。因此，必须进一步推广实行“土洋专家、干部和群众”三结合的经验。重要的技术措施，不能只是由少数人决定，特别要注意听取有经验的老农的意见，由大家商量决定。四、开展丰产竞赛运动，保证丰产又丰收。在竞赛运动中，充分运用去年的经验，贯彻不断革命精神，一浪赶一浪，一个高潮接一个高潮，这里要特别注意防止形式主义的发生；要及时评比检查，大力帮助落后的生产单位赶上先进的生产单位。在收益分配上，贯彻执行按劳分配、等价交换的原则，把加强政治思想工作和关心社员物质利益结合起来，以充分调动广大社员的生产积极性。
    贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法，是我们取得去年巨大跃进的基本保证。在去年大搞群众运动中，广大干部，包括公社干部，取得了在各项工作中贯彻执行群众路线的丰富经验。今年他们将会更好地把集中领导和大搞群众运动正确结合起来。他们将会更好地发扬群众路线的作风，发动群众，依靠群众，调动广大群众的积极性，发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神，实现今年农业大跃进的光荣任务。
    在中央和毛主席的领导下，我省广大人民和广大干部，决心高举总路线的红旗，在完成和超额完成一九五九年的农业生产计划的斗争中，争得上游。
