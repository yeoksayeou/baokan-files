Comrade Li Lin Yu's Speech:

Chairman, Fellow Committee Members:

	I fully support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I would like to share some of my experiences with the Party's education policies.

	After studying during last year's Great Leap Forward and now studying Premier Zhou's clear instructions on education, I realize that my past views on the meaning of education, though changed several times, have now been preliminarily clarified.

	Regarding the Party's Education Policy

	I recently read "Mao Zedong on Education," published by the People's Education Publishing House, which collects Mao Zedong's statements on education. I also read Comrade Lu Dingyi's article "Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor," published in the seventh issue of "Red Flag" magazine on September 1, 1958. I have come to understand three points that I had not deeply grasped theoretically before liberation, or even in the first few years after liberation.

	First, education has a class character, while I used to think it was above class. This is the most important point: the question of who education serves. Chairman Mao said: "In the world today, all culture or literature and art belongs to a certain class and a certain political line" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," May 1942). In the early days of liberation, when I first heard the Party's slogan of "serving the people wholeheartedly," it certainly applied to educators as well. However, at that time, I knew nothing about Marxist theory and did not appreciate the profound meaning of this slogan, thinking it was just a general slogan.

	How did this error occur? Originally, when I first studied Marxism, I thought science had a class character. Later, I learned that science itself does not have a class character, so I carelessly assumed that education could be compared to science and did not have a class character. Later, I investigated further and realized that education is not a natural science but a social science, so of course it has a class character. However, I hesitated again, feeling that everyone has the opportunity to receive education and can learn any profession, skill, or art as long as they put in enough effort. Therefore, I thought education was "impartial," not divided by class or above class. Now, this point has been clarified in my thinking. Education under different systems is based on the interests of different classes.

	Second, education should follow politics. I used to think that education could be carried out independently and did not need to be concerned with politics. Chairman Mao's quote above refutes this view. Originally, the saying "for what" and "what for" – what we are talking about now is "education for education's sake" – was a formula created by bourgeois scholars. It doesn't seem like our past feudal era saying. At that time, the saying was "mastering the classics for practical use," which also talked about how to "be a person" and how to "handle affairs," but that was feudal moral education, designed to consolidate the feudal system.

	On this point, I didn't realize it before liberation, and I didn't pay attention to it in the first few years after liberation. Although the purely technical viewpoint has also been criticized, and although it is also believed that education cannot be done well if politics is bad. But politically and educationally, I never felt that they were inseparable. It wasn't until last year's Great Leap Forward, when the Party put forward the clear slogan "politics in command," that I more deeply realized that without serving politics, education would become empty talk, useless, and completely contrary to the truth of Marxism, severing everything that is internally connected, making the big mistake of looking at problems in isolation, which is completely untenable. Before liberation, I often warned students: in school, make good use of your time to learn skills, and after graduation, when you go out into society to work, you can join whatever political faction you want, the school doesn't care. At that time, I spoke plausibly and even received praise, but now it seems like a complete mess of words, laughable and pathetic!

	Third, education and productive labor should be combined, and mental labor and physical labor should not be neglected. I used to think that mental and physical labor could be divided. Of course, the feudal saying that "those who labor with their minds govern others" was negated by the slogan "labor is sacred" during the May Fourth Movement, but the idea of division of labor still seemed reasonable in consciousness. In fact, it is a disguised lie, defending the bourgeoisie.

	Regarding this point, I believe it is a long-term, rational, perfect, and good point. Whether it is a socialist society or a communist society, this point is always needed for mankind to expect a happy life, and it is also something that people are willing to implement. Comrade Lu Dingyi said in his article: "'The 18th-century utopian socialists Fourier and Owen began to put forward the idea of combining education with productive labor.' Marx, Engels, and Lenin all agreed with this idea." He also said: "The Party had already put forward this policy in 1934." In 1954... when the first Five-Year Plan had already begun, the Party Central Committee once again proposed the issue of adding productive labor courses in schools, but it encountered some obstacles and could not be implemented. The National Propaganda Work Conference in March 1957, the "People's Daily" editorial on April 8 of the same year, and the Nanning Conference in January 1958, the Party Central Committee repeatedly emphasized the proposition that education must be combined with productive labor. It was not until now that the Party's proposition was realized nationwide. Premier Zhou also said in this report that "in our schools, productive labor has already begun to be formally included in the education plan," which shows the Party's importance to this matter. Premier Zhou also said: "Those who hold the views of the exploiting classes in the old society on running education will of course oppose our policy." He also said: "Our education policy is fundamentally opposed to this policy of the bourgeoisie." Premier Zhou said "oppose" and then said "opposed," which shows that in our consciousness, the view of education that is divorced from productive labor must be completely eradicated, with no room for reservation. We must always keep this matter in mind, under the leadership of the Party, in our own positions, do everything possible and all we can, and do everything possible to complete this thorough revolutionary task.

	Regarding the Tibet Issue

	Regarding the Tibet issue, I would like to share my thoughts. Tibet has always been a part of Chinese territory, which is recognized by the whole world and is not in any way a problem. After liberation, our central government announced the policy of treating ethnic minorities. In areas with more ethnic minorities, autonomous rights are granted under the leadership of the central government. This is written in the Constitution and known to the world.

	The "Five Principles" jointly proposed by China and India have been approved by all except a few imperialist countries with aggressive tendencies. Recently, reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet launched a rebellion, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, and fled to India, claiming "asylum" and "seeking help." Some Indian expansionist elements colluded with British imperialist elements, both plotting this rebellion in advance and, after the rebellion was basically quelled, making a big fuss and doing everything possible to slander our government, even insulting the portrait of our Chairman Mao. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

	There have never been conflicts between China and India. Therefore, when our Premier Zhou visited India and issued a joint statement with Prime Minister Nehru, our people were all overjoyed and rejoiced that Sino-Indian friendship would be increasingly consolidated and developed. However, in this Tibetan rebellion, some powerful politicians in India have not remained aloof, allowing expansionist elements to interfere in our internal affairs and undermine Sino-Indian friendship. We Chinese people are sincerely puzzled.

	We fully support our government's attitude and policy. We hope that the Dalai Lama will resolutely break with the Tibetan counter-revolutionary elements and return to the embrace of the motherland. We hope that wise politicians in India will cherish the friendship between China and India and not damage it due to the Tibetan rebellion, so that the imperialists' conspiracy will succeed.

    对于党的教育方针的几点体会
    并斥印度扩张主义分子
    李麟玉委员的发言主席、各位委员：
   我完全拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告。我谈一谈我对于党的教育方针政策的一点体会。
    经过去年大跃进的学习，现在又学习了周总理的报告中关于教育工作的明确的指示，我认识到我过去对于教育的意义的看法，虽然也有过几次的改变，现在得到一个初步的澄清。
    关于党的教育方针
    我在最近读了人民教育出版社出版的“毛泽东同志论教育工作”，它把毛主席的著作里有关教育的言论都收集在一起。又读了陆定一同志在一九五八年九月一日在第七号“红旗”杂志上发表的“教育必须与生产劳动相结合”一文。我所能体会到的综合起来有三点，是我在解放前，甚至在解放后头几年，在理论上还没有能深刻地领略到的。
    第一，教育是有阶级性的，而我过去以为教育是超阶级的。这是最重要的一条；教育为谁服务的问题。毛主席说过：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的”（在“延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”一九四二年五月）。解放初期，我第一次听见党的“全心全意为人民服务”的口号，这当然对于教育工作者也是适用的。不过当时我对于马克思的理论一窍不通，体会不到这个口号的深刻意义，以为不过是一个一般的口号罢了。
    这个错误是怎样发生的呢？原来在刚一学习马克思主义的时候，认为科学是有阶级性的。后来知道科学本身是没有阶级性的，因此就粗心大意地认为教育可以同科学比拟，没有阶级性。后来又加深究，教育不是一种自然科学而是一种社会科学，当然有阶级性，不过又有犹豫，觉得任何人都有受教育的机会，也都可能学到无论哪一门业务，哪一种技术或艺术，只要尽了相当的努力。因此又认为教育是“一秉大公”的，不分阶级、超阶级的。现在对于这一点在我的思想上加以澄清了。不同制度下的教育是以不同阶级的利益为前提的。
    第二，教育是要跟着政治走的。我过去以为教育可以单独进行，不必过问政治。上面引用的毛主席的那句话正是否定这个看法的。本来这个为“什么”而“什么”的说法，现在我们所谈的是“为教育而教育”——是由资产阶级学者创出来的公式。好像不是我们过去的封建时代的说法。那个时候的说法是“通经致用”，也讲怎样“做人”也讲怎样“办事”，不过那是封建道德教育，是为巩固封建制度设想的。
    关于这一点，不单在解放前我没有认识到，就是在解放后头几年也还没有注意到。虽然纯技术观点也被批判过，虽然也认为政治不良教育是办不好的。但是政治与教育在意识上总没有感觉到分不开。直到去年大跃进，党提出了明确的口号“政治挂帅”，这才更深刻地体会到离开为政治服务，教育将变为空谈，无济于事，而且是完全违背了马克思主义的真理，割裂了有内在联系的一切，犯了孤立看问题的大毛病，是完全说不通的。我在解放前时常对学生告诫：在学校里，好好地利用时间，学本事，毕业以后到社会上做事，你愿意参加什么样政治派别都随你的便，学校是不管这回事的。当时振振有词，还得到人家的赞许，现在看起来完全是一片糊涂话，可笑也复可怜！
    第三，教育与生产劳动应当是相结合的，脑力劳动与体力劳动是不应该偏废的。而我过去以为劳心、劳力可以分工的。固然封建时代的“劳力者治于人”的说法，早在“五四”运动期间被“劳工神圣”的口号给否定了，但是分工的说法在意识上还觉得言之成理。其实是一句变相的假话，为资产阶级辩护的。
    关于这一点我认为它是一个长期的，合理的，尽美尽善的一点，无论是社会主义社会，还是共产主义社会，这一点总是为人类期望美满的生活所需要的，也是人所乐意实行的。陆定一同志在他的文章里说：“‘十八世纪空想社会主义者傅利叶和欧文，开始提出教育与生产劳动相结合的思想’马克思、恩格斯、列宁都赞成这个思想”，又说：“党在一九三四年就已经提出这个方针。”一九五四年……第一个五年计划已经开始的时候，党中央又曾经提出过在学校里增设生产劳动课程的问题，但是遇到一些阻碍，没有能够贯彻，一九五七年三月的全国宣传工作会议，同年四月八日“人民日报”的社论，一九五八年一月的南宁会议，党中央屡次强调了教育必须与生产劳动相结合的主张。直到现在，党的主张才在全国范围内实现了。周总理在这次的报告中也说到“在我们的学校中，已经开始把生产劳动正式列入教育计划”，可见党对于这件事的重视。周总理还说：“抱着旧社会中剥削阶级办教育的观点的人，当然要反对我们的方针。”又说：“我们的教育方针，是和资产阶级的这种方针根本对立的”，周总理又说“反对”再说“对立”可见在我们的意识中脱离生产劳动的教育观点必须根除净尽，丝毫不许保留。我们一定要把这件事经常放在脑子里，在党的领导下，在自己的岗位上，尽一切可能尽的力量，千方百计地完成这个彻底的革命的任务。
    关于西藏问题
    关于西藏问题，我谈一谈我的感想。西藏从来就是中国领土的一部分，这是全世界所公认，丝毫没有问题的。解放以后，我国中央政府宣布了对待少数民族的政策。少数民族较多的地方，在中央政府领导下，予以自治权利。载在宪法，举世皆知。
    我国和印度共同倡议的“五项原则”，除少数侵略成性的帝国主义国家以外，莫不赞同。最近西藏上层反动分子发动叛乱，劫持达赖喇嘛，口称“避难”逃往印境“求救”。若干印度扩张主义分子勾结英帝国主义分子，既在事先策动这次叛乱事件，又在叛乱基本平息以后大肆借题发挥，竭尽诬蔑我政府之能事，甚至侮辱我毛主席像，这是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    中印两国之间，向来没有过冲突。所以我们的周总理访印期间同尼赫鲁总理发表共同声明，我国人民莫不欢欣鼓舞，庆幸中印友好将日益巩固和发展。乃此次西藏叛乱，印度的一些当权的政治家，迄未置身事外，听任扩张主义分子干涉我国内政，破坏中印友好。我们中国人民诚百思不得其解。
    我们完全拥护我国政府的态度和政策。我们希望达赖喇嘛毅然决然与西藏反革命分子一刀两断，回到祖国的怀抱。我们希望印度明智的政治家珍惜中印两国的友谊，勿因西藏叛乱事件而有所伤损，致使帝国主义者阴谋得逞。
