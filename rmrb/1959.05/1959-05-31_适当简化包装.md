    Appropriately Simplify Packaging
    Packaging is an important component of a commodity, and it is absolutely necessary to value the quality of packaging materials. However, I feel that the packaging of some commodities is currently too elaborate, which is not in line with the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy. For example, one type of milk shortcake candy has three layers of packaging: the first layer is a three-color trademark paper, the second layer is a cardboard layer, and the third layer is cellophane. Such a small piece of candy is wrapped in so many layers of paper, which will not only increase the cost of the candy, but also waste valuable paper, which is a real pity. I believe that under the principle of not affecting the quality, specifications, transportation, storage, and use of commodities, the packaging of some commodities can be appropriately simplified, or replaced with other things. For example, some hard candies can be wrapped with fewer layers of paper, or packaged in bags or boxes. Some canned goods can be considered to be packaged in earthenware jars or glass bottles. In this way, the cost of commodities can be reduced, and materials with greater and more uses can be used in direct production to play a greater role. Of course, the packaging quality of export commodities should be higher, and sometimes it should be as exquisite as possible, because it represents our great motherland.

    适当简化包装
    包装是商品的重要组成部分，重视包装用品的质量是十分必要的。不过，我觉得目前有些商品的包装过于讲究，不符合增产节约要求。如有一种牛奶酥软糖包装三层：第一层是三色商标纸，第二层是硬纸层，第三层是玻璃纸，小小一块糖，包了这么多层纸，不但会提高糖的成本，浪费了贵重纸张也实在可惜。我认为在不影响商品质量、规格、运输、保管、使用的原则下，有些商品的包装可以适当简化一下，或者用其他东西代用。如有些水果糖可以少包几层纸，或者用袋装、盒装。有些罐头可考虑用陶罐或玻璃瓶装。这样，商品的成本可以降低，又可以使那些用途较大较多的物资用到直接生产中去，发挥更大的作用。当然，出口的商品包装质量应当高一些，有时还应尽可能搞得精美，因为它代表我们伟大的祖国。
