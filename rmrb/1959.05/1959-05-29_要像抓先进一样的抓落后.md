    Objective things are always in motion and developing, from balance to imbalance, and then to a new balance; imbalance is constant and absolute; balance is temporary and relative. Any thing undergoes this spiral repetition of "balance - imbalance - new balance," and thus constantly develops. In all our work, we must adopt a positive attitude, guide the situation, consciously cultivate and promote advanced things, and effectively help backward units catch up with the advanced and achieve balance on a new basis. After achieving a rough balance on a new basis, we must not be content with the status quo, but must still discover and promote the growth of new things, which will lead to a new imbalance, and then seek balance on the basis of the new imbalance. This cycle continues, advancing in waves, which will continuously increase production and promote the socialist construction cause to leap forward again and again.

    It is based on this understanding that we have always adopted the working method of grasping the key points to drive the general in rural production work, grasping the advanced and leading the backward, which is only one aspect of this working method. There are also two other aspects, namely, grasping the backward to catch up with the advanced, and grasping the middle to lead both ends. Their common purpose is to turn the backward into the advanced and achieve balance on the basis of the advanced. In the past, for a relatively long period, although there were imbalances in the development of production movements, these imbalances were mainly caused by differences in natural conditions, and everyone was basically in a state of relative poverty and low production levels. In order to change this state of poverty and backwardness, in terms of leadership methods, the focus was generally on grasping the advanced, so as to set an example, lead the backward with the advanced, and promote the general, which was of course necessary. The situation is different now. After several years of large-scale production movement on the basis of agricultural cooperation, especially after the great leap forward in production in 1958 and the people's commune movement, the imbalance in production development has become more prominent. This imbalance is not only manifested in differences in natural conditions, but also in the emergence of new imbalances under the same natural conditions. That is to say, some communes, management areas, and production teams have made rapid leaps forward, or have achieved higher yields, more advanced, or have leapt from low yields to high yields, and from backward to advanced; some communes, management areas, and production teams have made slower leaps forward, and although they have also achieved varying degrees of growth compared with the past, they are far behind the advanced. Since this new imbalance generated on the basis of the new leap forward is so prominently manifested, then it is necessary for us to focus on grasping the backward and poor communes, management areas, and production teams in the coming period, and first break through these weak links in order to promote the entire production movement to continue to develop. The experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 proves that the poorer and more backward the communes, management areas, and production teams are, the greater their production potential. As long as they are raised to the advanced level, the leaping speed of the entire production will be greatly accelerated. The masses in these areas, having seen many advanced examples in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, have broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and realized that there is no insurmountable gap between turning from poor to rich and from backward to advanced, and urgently demand to strengthen leadership, change the backward face of production, and improve their living standards. This is a very favorable situation. As long as the leadership catches up, the competition movement of the poor catching up with the rich and the backward catching up with the advanced will be carried out enthusiastically.

### 要像抓先进一样的抓落后

    要像抓先进一样的抓落后
    客观事物总是在运动着，发展着，从平衡到不平衡，再到新的平衡；不平衡是经常的，绝对的；平衡是暂时的，相对的。任何事物经过“平衡——不平衡——新的平衡”这种螺旋式的反复，也就不断地得到发展。我们在各项工作中，必须采取积极的态度，因势利导，自觉地培养、发扬先进事物，切实地帮助落后单位，赶上先进，在新的基础上求得平衡。而在新的基础上求得大体平衡以后，我们也不能安于现状，仍然要从中发现和促进新生事物的生长，这又会出现一个新的不平衡，然后再在新的不平衡的基础上再求得平衡。如此反复不已，波浪式前进，就会使生产不断提高，促进社会主义建设事业跃进再跃进。
    正是基于这种认识，我们在农村生产工作中，一直采取了抓住重点，带动一般的工作方法，抓先进、带落后，只是这种工作方法的一个方面。还有另外两个方面，即抓落后、赶先进，和抓中间、带两头。其共同目的都是为了使落后变先进，在先进的基础上求得平衡。在过去较长的一个时期，生产运动的发展虽然也有不平衡现象，这种不平衡主要是由于自然条件的差异所造成的，大家基本上都处于比较贫穷和生产水平不高的状态。为了改变这种贫穷和落后的状态，在领导方法上，一般是把重点放在抓先进方面，以便树立榜样，以先进带落后，推动一般，这当然是必要的。现在的情况不同了，经过几年来在农业合作化基础上的大生产运动，特别是经过1958年生产大跃进运动，和人民公社化运动，生产发展上的不平衡的状况，更为突出地暴露出来了。这种不平衡，不仅表现在自然条件的差异上，而是在同样自然条件下出现了新的不平衡。这就是：有的社、管理区和生产队，跃进速度很快，或者是高产更高产，先进更先进，或者是由低产一跃而为高产，落后一跃而为先进；有的社、管理区和生产队，跃进速度则较慢，和过去比较，他们虽也有不同程度的增长，但和先进比较，却相差很大。这种在新的跃进基础上所产生的新的不平衡，既然突出地表现出来，那末，我们就有必要在今后一定时期内，把抓落后和贫穷的社、管理区和生产队当作重点，首先突破这些薄弱环节，以推动整个生产运动，继续向前发展。1958年大跃进的经验证明，越是穷的、工作落后的公社、管理区和生产队，生产上的潜力越大。只要把他们提高到先进的水平，就会大大加快整个生产的跃进速度。而这些地方的群众，由于从1958年的大跃进中，看到了许多先进的事例，破除了迷信，解放了思想，认识到由穷变富、由落后变先进，这中间并没有什么不可逾越的鸿沟，迫切要求加强领导，改变落后的生产面貌，提高生活水平。这是一个很有利的形势。只要领导赶上去，那末，穷赶富、落后赶先进的竞赛运动就会热火朝天地开展起来。
