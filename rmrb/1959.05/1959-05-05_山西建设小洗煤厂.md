    Shanxi Builds Small Coal Washing Plants
    Following the commencement of construction of twenty-one large and medium-sized simple coal washing plants, Shanxi Province has also newly built twenty-eight small-scale, indigenous coal washing plants near small-scale steel bases. The production capacity of this batch of small coal washing plants is 1.5 million tons per year.
    These small coal washing plants will use "wooden piston jigging machines" to wash coal. This machine requires less investment, can be built quickly, is easy to operate, and can guarantee the quality of coal washing.

    山西建设小洗煤厂
    山西省继二十一个大中型简易洗选厂开工建设之后，又在小型钢铁基地附近新建二十八个小型土法洗煤厂。这批小型洗煤厂的生产能力是年产一百五十万吨。
    这批小型洗煤厂将采用“木制活塞跳汰机”洗煤。这种机器投资少，建设快，操作方便，能保证洗煤质量。
