Six Years of University Life
Lin Weinan, graduating student of the Department of Architecture, Tsinghua University

	In Tsinghua Garden, we have experienced six springs!
	For six years, under the cultivation of the Party, the eighty-five graduating students of our architecture major have grown up in all aspects of political thought and professional knowledge.
	There was a younger classmate in the class, everyone called him "Old Eight". When he first came to university, he was not even old enough to vote. He would blush for a long time when he made a speech at a class meeting. Now, he has become a member of the Communist Youth League and is the leader of a small group designing a reservoir power station in the graduation design. Another classmate we call "Big Sister," Zhou Yuhua, transferred from the army to take the university entrance examination. She hadn't studied for seven years before going to university (she studied at a secondary normal school seven years ago). After arriving at university, she could only use a triangle ruler to draw straight lines when learning to draw in art class, and she lacked the foundation of higher algebra in higher mathematics. She often couldn't grasp the teacher's main points during lectures. However, difficulties did not defeat her. She said, "If there are difficulties, overcome them. Like climbing stairs, step by step, you will eventually be able to go up!" Indeed, due to her diligent and down-to-earth efforts, she finally became a good student who was both red and expert in the class. She joined the Communist Party of China and now serves as the secretary of the Party branch in the class. In the graduation design, she independently undertakes the architectural design of an important project. ... Like these things, now every classmate in our class can say a lot!
	Six years ago, we came to Tsinghua from all over the country with the ideals of young people, holding the ambition to build tall buildings for the people of the motherland. Many students felt that the Party had allowed them to come here to study, with a good learning environment, excellent teachers, and teaching equipment. They were determined to work hard and aspire to be red architects. However, the profound understanding of being a red architect involved a process of struggle. Some students, influenced by bourgeois individualism and bourgeois architectural thought, held the goal of erecting "monuments" for themselves, and desperately pursued strange and bizarre bourgeois architectural forms, advocating that professional work should be separated from politics, and taking the road of being "expert but not red."
	In a series of political movements and teaching debates such as rectification, anti-rightist, and anti-"three evils" and "five evils," we severely criticized bourgeois ideology. Following this, the school implemented the policy of "education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor." Starting from August last year, we accepted national production tasks and joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. Through extensive social contact and education from workers and peasants, we further realized that we must take the road of being both red and expert.
	In the past, some students in the class would frown and hold their noses even when visiting workers' residences. Now, the students eat, live, and work with the members of the people's commune, help the commune with planning and design, and participate in construction. From ramming the foundation, laying bricks, and tiling to interior painting, they work together with the commune members, and also take on some technical leadership work on the construction site. In the design, without original data, the students conducted door-to-door surveys and visited, climbed mountains and waded through rivers to survey the terrain, and drew the topographic map. When the commune members talked about our students, they affectionately called us their own college students.
	Indeed, the ideological outlook of every student has undergone profound changes: When talking about the past, everyone excitedly says: The Party has guided us on the right path, we must be determined to become intellectuals of the working class, determined to "build mansions of a billion rooms, making 600 million people smile," and be a true red architect!
	Six years, this is the process of our political and ideological growth, and also the process of professional knowledge growth!
	Under the diligent guidance of teachers, we have completed more than forty courses (including more than thirty basic courses, professional courses, and four political theory courses), and participated in several internships on construction sites. This has enabled us to initially possess the basic knowledge that an architect should have.
	Since August of last year, combined with national production tasks, we have carried out graduation design. Under the guidance of experienced teachers and experts from production departments, students have participated in the planning and design of nearly thirty counties and cities. Among them are the Beijing East Suburb Residential Area Planning, Changxindian Workers' Area Planning, and Hebei Chengde Sanatorium Area Planning. In addition, we participated in the design of nearly 200,000 square meters of industrial factory buildings and civil buildings, including a technically complex theater design. Many students and experienced teachers from civil engineering, machinery, electrical automation control, engineering mathematics, and mechanics also participated in the design.
	From these practical exercises, we felt that we had indeed mastered certain knowledge. However, encountering many complex technical or production problems in practice made us feel that our knowledge was still lacking and we needed to study harder.
	The theater design is an example. In the past, we had learned the principles of theater design, done theater course design, and studied professional basic courses such as fine arts, Chinese and foreign architectural history, preliminary architectural design, engineering structure, and construction technology. We had mastered certain design capabilities, painting skills, and had a certain artistic accomplishment. However, it was not easy for us to truly achieve high quality, high art, and economic cost in the entire design. Under the guidance of senior teachers, we sought advice from books, learned from existing experiences at home and abroad, and learned from workers and all those who were able. We conducted many investigations and visits. Students searched for a large amount of information for theater design from the department library, school library, teachers' private collections, the Beijing Library, and the Academy of Sciences Library, and cooperated with relevant units outside the school to translate nearly two hundred theater design materials in nine languages ​​including Russian, English, German, French, Japanese, Spanish, Greek, Hungarian, and Czech. Everything useful in the books was used by us. We carefully analyzed the architectural art of theaters from ancient Egypt to the Renaissance, from Western classical to modern, as well as Soviet and Chinese. On the basis of in-depth analysis and research of these materials, we went deep into reality, investigated some theaters in eighteen cities including Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, and interviewed many theater managers, management personnel, directors, actors, and audiences, as well as many experienced old workers and architectural experts. Through these investigations and visits, we expanded and consolidated our knowledge; helped our design, and also cultivated our excellent style of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses.
	Now, our graduation design is continuing, and every student is determined to complete the graduation design excellently. The future of the great motherland is always in our minds: yesterday was a desolate wilderness, today it is a building; last night was a dark valley, tomorrow night it will be a light. And our life, there is always an endless wilderness in front of us, and behind us are tall buildings and brand new factories. In this way, we will always fight and rush forward.

    大学生活的六年
    清华大学建筑系应届毕业生  林维南
    在清华园，我们经历了六个春天！
    六年，在党的培养下，我们建筑学专业应届毕业的八十五个同学，在政治思想和业务知识各方面都成长起来了。
    班上有一个年龄较小的同学，大家叫他“老八”，刚来大学时，还不到选民的年岁，班上开会发一次言都要脸红半天。现在，他已经成了一个共青团员，在毕业设计中，担任了一个水库电站建筑设计的小组长。另一个我们叫她“大姐”的周玉华，她是从部队转业考到大学来的。上大学前，已经七年没有念书了（七年前念过中等师范）。到大学后，上美术课学画画只会用三角板画直线，念高等数学缺少大代数的基础，听课常捉不住教师讲的要领，但是，困难并没有难倒她。她说：“有困难就克服，像上台阶一样，一步一步，总有一天能上去！”的确，由于她刻苦踏实的努力，终于成了班上一个又红又专的好学生。她参加了中国共产党，现在又担任了班上党支部书记的工作。在毕业设计中，她独立担负着一项重要工程的建筑设计。……像这些事，现在我们班上的每个同学都能说好多！
    六年前，我们带着年青人的理想，抱着为祖国人民建造高楼大厦的志向，从祖国的四面八方来到了清华。许多同学都感到党让自己来这里学习，有良好的学习环境，又有很好的教师和教学设备，决心好好下苦功，立志做一个红色的建筑师。但是，对于做一个红色建筑师的深刻理解，却有一段斗争的过程。有些同学，受了资产阶级个人主义和资产阶级建筑思想的影响，抱着为个人树立“纪念碑”的目的，极力追求新奇怪异的资产阶级建筑形式，提倡业务脱离政治，走“只专不红”的道路。
    在整风、反右派以及双反等一系列政治运动和教学辩论中，我们狠狠地批判了资产阶级思想。紧接着，学校贯彻执行“教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，从去年8月开始，我们接受了国家的生产任务，投入了工农
  业大跃进的行列。在广泛的社会接触和工农群众教育下，我们进一步认识到必须走
  又红又专的道路。
    过去班上有些同学，连参观工人住宅都要皱眉头、捂鼻子，现在，同学们和人民公社的社员们同吃、同住、同劳动，帮公社搞规划、做设计，并参加施工，从夯基础、砌砖、铺瓦到室内粉刷，都和社员们一起干，同时还担任了工地上的一些技术领导工作。在设计中，没有原始资料，同学们挨家挨户进行调查访问，爬山涉水踏勘地形，把地形图画下来。社员们一谈起我们同学，都亲切地称我们是他们自己的大学生。
    的确，现在每一个同学的思想面貌都起了深刻的变化：在谈起过去的时候，大家都激动地说：党给我们指引了正确的道路，我们一定要立志作工人阶级知识分子，立志要“盖得广厦亿万间，六亿人民俱开颜”，做一个真正的红色建筑师！
    六年，这是我们政治思想成长的过程，同时又是业务知识成长的过程！
    在教师辛勤教导下，我们学完了四十多门功课（包括三十多门基础课、专业课和四门政治理论课），在工地参加过几次实习，这使得我们初步具备了一个建筑师应有的基本知识。
    从去年8月以来，结合国家生产任务，我们进行了毕业设计。在一些有经验的教师和生产部门的专家指导下，同学先后参加了近三十个县、市的规划设计工作。其中像北京市东郊居住区规划，长辛店工人区规划及河北承德市休养区规划等。另外，参加了将近二十万平方公尺的工业厂房及民用建筑设计，其中包括一个技术要求较复杂的剧院设计。参加一起设计的还有土木、机械、电机自动控制、工程数学力学等专业的许多同学和有经验的教师。
    从这些实际的锻炼中，我们感到自己的确掌握了一定的知识，但是，在实际中碰到许多复杂的技术或生产问题，又使我们感到知识还很少，需要更努力去学习。
    剧院设计就是一个例子。过去，我们学过剧院设计的原理，做过剧院的课程设计，并且，学过美术、中外建筑史、建筑设计初步工程结构和施工技术等专业基础课，掌握了一定的设计能力、绘画技巧，也有了一定的艺术修养。但是，要使整个设计真正做到高质量、高艺术，而又造价经济，对我们来说不是容易的事，在年长教师指导下，我们向书本求教，学习国内外已有的经验，我们更向工人和一切能者学习，进行了许多调查和访问。同学们从系图书馆、学校图书馆，教师私人藏书室、北京图书馆和科学院图书馆等各处，为剧院设计搜罗了大批资料，并和校外各有关单位合作，翻译了俄、英、德、法、
  日、西、希、匈、捷等九国文字将近二百个剧院的设计资料。书本上一切有用的东西，都拿来为我们所用，我们仔细地分析了从古埃及到文艺复兴时代，从西洋古典到摩登以及苏联和我国的剧院建筑艺术。在对这些资料深入分析和研究的基础上，我们又深入实际，调查了北京、南京、上海、重庆等十八个城市的一些剧院，访问了许多剧院的经理、管理人员、导演、演员和观众，以及许多有经验的老工人和建筑专家。通过这些调查访问，扩大和巩固了我们的知识；帮助了我们的设计，而且，也培养了我们联系实际、联系群众的优良作风。
    现在，我们的毕业设计正在继续进行，每一个同学都决心要出色地完成毕业设计。伟大的祖国的未来，时刻在我们脑海中憧憬着：昨天还是荒凉的旷野，今天就是一片楼房；昨夜还是漆黑的山谷，明晚就是一片灯光。而我们的一生，前面总是无尽的原野，身后总是高楼大厦和崭新的厂房，就这样，永远战斗着奔向前方。
