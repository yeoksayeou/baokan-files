Fellow Deputies:

We warmly support Premier Zhou’s report on the work of the government. This report has given us tremendous excitement and encouragement.

The four of us come from the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia, construction sites in the Northwest, the magnificent iron and steel base of Anshan, and Shanghai, the largest industrial city on the coast. Like the working people all over the country, the working people in these places, on the basis of the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, are fighting bravely with more abundant work enthusiasm to complete the grand national economic plan of the motherland in 1959. We, who are engaged in literary work, have been inspired by the soaring enthusiasm and moved by the infinite wisdom in the process of living and working with workers, commune members, and herdsmen; our thoughts and feelings have been continuously enlightened and continue to change. All this has made us further realize the profound significance of Chairman Mao's teaching that we should devote ourselves wholeheartedly to the fiery struggle for a long time. Literature and art are important ideological work. Facing such a vivid, colorful, and rich real life, we feel that even if we write non-stop, we are still overwhelmed, and we often feel uneasy that our works cannot deeply reflect this life and summarize the spirit of the times. However, we firmly believe that as long as we persist in being with the broad masses of working people, sharing labor and breathing the same air, working hard to reform ourselves, working hard, and studying tirelessly, we will gradually mature our thoughts, further grasp the laws of life, and produce vigorous and fresh works.

Now, the working people are changing the poor and blank face of our country and building a socialist society with the spirit of overwhelming mountains and rivers. This situation not only requires the existing literary and art workers to grow more solidly, but also requires the entire literary and art team to grow more rapidly. In 1958, an extremely gratifying phenomenon appeared, that is, mass literary and artistic activities developed vigorously. Talented authors from among workers, peasants, and soldiers are constantly emerging. They shook readers with their initial new voices, and on the other hand, they are in great need of in-depth support and cultivation. We believe that the literary leadership organs in various places should vigorously support them, the editorial departments of publications should patiently guide them, and the professional literary and art workers working at the grassroots level should devote some of their time and labor to enthusiastically helping them. According to our experience, the combination of professional and amateur literary workers is not only conducive to the development of mass literature and art and the emergence of new authors, but also a great education for professional literary and art workers.

After the rectification and anti-rightist campaign in the past two years, erroneous literary thoughts have lost their ground. The urgent task at present is how to further improve the quality of our works. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, professional literary workers and amateur authors of the masses, going deep into life, intensifying study, concentrating on one goal, and diligently cultivating their skills, our literary undertaking will be fundamentally changed. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 has greatly promoted the cause of literary creation, and the greater leap forward in 1959 will inevitably lead our literary creation cause to a wider and more comprehensive development. Premier Zhou pointed out in his government work report: "Before long, our scientific and cultural undertakings will surely enter a prosperous era and achieve great achievements." This is completely correct and can be achieved with everyone's efforts. Let us work hard to realize this call!

Finally, we read the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" issued in Tezpur, India, on April 18 and express our great indignation and severe condemnation. Tibet has always been Chinese territory. The Tibet issue is purely an internal affair of China, and no one is allowed to interfere. A small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet, instigated by imperialism, kidnapped the Dalai Lama, betrayed the motherland, and fled to India after the failure of the armed rebellion. They were not only greeted by Indian officials, but also distributed an English translation of this document filled with lies and openly slandering our country through Indian diplomatic officials. Indian expansionist elements, with the tacit consent of the police, dared to clamor threats and insult the portraits of our national leaders, which we absolutely cannot tolerate.

The Tibetan rebellion has been quelled, the remaining bandits can be wiped out immediately, and the Tibetan people will soon destroy the feudal serf system and gradually carry out socialist reforms. The illusion of imperialists and Indian expansionists to use the Tibetan plateau as a means to undermine China's unity and socialist construction has been forever shattered. The Tibetan plateau will surely stand proudly, like other regions of our country, as a large socialist garden, and be presented before the Asian people who love peace and uphold the Five Principles.

### 专业文艺工作者和群众文艺工作者结合  纳·赛音朝克图、杜鹏程、草明、唐弢委员的联合发言

    专业文艺工作者和群众文艺工作者结合
    纳·赛音朝克图、杜鹏程、草明、唐弢委员的联合发言各位委员：
    我们热烈地拥护周总理关于政府工作的报告，这个报告给了我们极大的兴奋和鼓舞。
    我们四个，来自辽阔的内蒙古草原，西北的建设工地，雄伟的钢铁基地鞍山，和沿海最大的工业城市上海。这些地方的劳动人民，和全国各地的劳动人民一样，在一九五八年大跃进的胜利基础上，正以更充沛的工作热情，为完成一九五九年祖国宏大的国民经济计划而奋勇战斗着。我们这些从事文学工作的人，在和工人、社员、牧民一道生活和工作的过程中，被那种冲天的干劲所鼓舞，被那种无穷的智慧所感动；我们的思想感情不断地受到启发，继续起着变化。这一切，使我们进一步体会到毛主席教导我们的长期的全身心的投到火热的斗争中去的深刻意义。文学艺术是一个重要的思想工作，面临着如此生动，如此多彩，如此丰富的现实生活，我们觉得即使笔不停挥，也仍有应接不暇之势，而且常常要为在自己的作品里不能深刻地反映这些生活和概括时代的精神面貌而感到惴惴不安。但是，我们坚信，只要坚持和广大劳动人民一道，同劳动，共呼吸，努力的改造，艰苦的工作，不懈的学习，便会逐渐地使自己的思想成熟，进一步掌握生活的规律，产生出刚健清新的作品来。
    现在，劳动人民正以气吞山河的气概，改变着我国一穷二白的面貌，建设社会主义社会。这种形势，不仅要求已有的文艺工作者更坚实地成长，而且也要求整个文艺队伍更迅速地壮大。一九五八年出现一个极为可喜的现象，这就是，群众文艺活动蓬勃地发展起来了。工农兵中间有才能的作者不断地涌现。他们以初试的新声震动了读者，另一方面，也极需深入的扶植和培养。我们认为，各地文艺领导机关固然要大力支持他们，刊物编辑部也应耐心指导他们，而在基层工作的专业文艺工作者，更应付出一部分时间和劳力，热心地帮助他们。根据我们的经验，专业文艺工作者和群众文艺工作者相结合，不仅有助于群众文艺的发展，有助于新的作者的涌现，而且对专业文艺工作者来说，也是一个很大的教育。
    经过两年来的整风反右，错误的文艺思想已站不住脚了。目前的迫切的课题是：如何来进一步提高我们作品的质量。我们相信：在党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的正确方针领导下，专业文艺工作者和群众业余作者一起，深入生活，加紧学习，专心一志，勤修苦炼，我们的文学事业将会根本改观。一九五八年的大跃进，已经大大地推动了文艺创作事业，一九五九年更大的跃进，势必使我们的文艺创作事业走向更广泛更全面的发展。周总理在政府工作报告中指出：“不要很久，我们的科学文化事业一定能够进入一个昌盛的时代，并且获得伟大的成就。”这是完全正确的，可以在大家努力下达到的，让我们为实现这一号召而奋力地工作吧！
    最后，我们读了四月十八日在印度提斯浦尔发表的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，表示极大的愤慨和严厉的谴责。西藏从来就是中国的领土。西藏问题纯粹是中国的内政问题，任何人都不得干涉。西藏一小撮上层反动集团在帝国主义唆使下，劫持达赖，背叛祖国，在武装叛乱失败后逃入印度，不但得到印度官员的迎接，而且还经由印度外交官员之手，散发了这个谎话连篇、公然诬蔑我国的文件英译本。印度扩张主义分子并在警察的默许下，胆敢叫嚣威胁，污辱我国家领导人的画像，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。
    西藏叛乱业经平定，残匪马上可以肃清，西藏人民即将摧毁封建农奴制度，逐步地进行社会主义改革。帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子想利用西藏高原作为破坏我国的统一和社会主义建设的幻想永远破灭了。西藏高原必将同我国其他地区一样成为社会主义的大花园，而傲然矗立，呈现在酷爱和平、维护五项原则的亚洲人民眼前。
