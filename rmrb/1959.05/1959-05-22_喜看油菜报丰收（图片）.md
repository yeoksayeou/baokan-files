    Joyfully Watching Rapeseed Announce a Bumper Harvest
    1. Yu Jiajun, First Secretary of the CPC Fushun County Committee in Sichuan Province, cultivated a "Rapeseed King" with abundant pods, requiring five people to hold hands to encircle it.
    2. This is a comparison of rapeseed plants from two different fields in Fushun County. The rapeseed in the "command field" has been topped three times, resulting in particularly numerous branches.
    3. The West Sichuan Plain, which is rich in rapeseed production, has seen particularly good rapeseed growth this year, joyfully reporting a bumper harvest. This shows members of the Jinniu People's Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu harvesting rapeseed. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter You Yungu

    喜看油菜报丰收
    1、中共四川省富顺县县委第一书记于家俊培植的一株“油菜王”，结荚累累，五个人手拉手才圈得住。
    2、这是富顺县两种田里的油菜植株比较。“指挥田”的油菜经过了三次打尖，分枝特别多。
    3、盛产油菜的川西平原，今年油菜长得特别好，喜报丰收。这是成都郊区金牛人民公社的社员们在收油菜。新华社记者　游云谷摄
