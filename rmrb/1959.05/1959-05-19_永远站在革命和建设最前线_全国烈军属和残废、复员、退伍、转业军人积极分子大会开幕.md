Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Disabled Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers, Retired Soldiers, and Transferred Soldiers opened today.

This congress is jointly convened by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The congress issued a call to the nation's martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, retired soldiers, and transferred soldiers: to carry forward the revolutionary tradition, exert greater efforts, and always stand at the forefront of revolution and construction; to further play an active role in this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan centered on the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

Attending the congress are one thousand and eighty-eight socialist construction activists, seventy-one representatives of advanced units in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, as well as representatives of the People's Liberation Army. Among the socialist construction activists, there are veteran Red Army soldiers who once climbed snow-capped mountains and crossed grasslands and are now renowned in their hometowns, demobilized soldiers, retired soldiers, and transferred soldiers who have carried forward the revolutionary tradition and continuously created new achievements on various fronts, revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary military families who are wholeheartedly devoted to the Party, and disabled soldiers full of revolutionary optimism.

At 3:00 p.m., Gan Siqi, Vice-Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and chairman of the congress, announced the opening of the meeting. A group of Young Pioneers from Beijing, representing the children of the capital, presented flowers to the congress and read out congratulatory messages.

Then, Qian Ying, Minister of Internal Affairs, delivered a report to the congress. In her report, she focused on the tremendous achievements made by the nation's martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, retired soldiers, and transferred soldiers on various fronts of the motherland since the Great Leap Forward last year. She said that in the winter of 1957 and the spring of 1958, after Party committees at all levels put forward the fighting task of farmland water conservancy and ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture, demobilized soldiers, retired soldiers, transferred soldiers, and able-bodied martyrs' families, military families, and disabled soldiers across the country were all spirited and invested in the high tide of farmland water conservancy construction. They were active, brave, unafraid of hardship, and undaunted by difficulties, and were a vital force whether in arduous projects or in dangerous areas. In addition, they have made considerable contributions in a series of agricultural bumper harvest movements such as improving soil, accumulating and producing fertilizer, rational close planting, field management, and planting high-yield experimental fields. They also showed high enthusiasm in the mass campaign to run industries. In many regions, almost all demobilized soldiers participated in this movement. In most parts of the country, there are factories named "August 1st" run by martyrs' families, military families, and demobilized soldiers. According to statistics from seven provinces, there are 63,819 small and medium-sized factories mainly established by martyrs' families, military families, and demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers. They have also made significant contributions to the technical revolution and technical innovation. According to statistics from Shanxi Province, in 1958, martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, and retired soldiers in the province created, improved, and imitated more than 800,000 pieces of various agricultural tools. In 1958, martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, and retired soldiers in Sichuan Province created and trial-produced more than 1.15 million agricultural tools.

She emphasized that their contribution to the country and the people cannot be estimated solely by the value and labor results created in production labor. More importantly, their consistent and unwavering loyalty to the revolutionary cause, the strong revolutionary will they have shown in building and defending the motherland, and their active role in various political movements have great educational significance for the broad masses and the People's Army, and are a political force that will always inspire people to move forward.

She said that at present, the people of the whole country have launched a vigorous and mass campaign to increase production and practice economy. The nation's martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, retired soldiers, and transferred soldiers should, in this movement, exert their efforts, strive for advancement, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. She hoped that the representatives attending the meeting would continue to hold high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction and forge ahead bravely; to be modest and prudent, unite the masses, and move forward together; to further enhance their political and ideological awareness, and carry forward the communist style; to listen to the Party, go wherever the Party points, and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with better and more brilliant achievements, and contribute more to the socialist construction of the motherland.

In her report, Qian Ying also praised the achievements made by the advanced units in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families who participated in the conference. On behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and comrades engaged in preferential treatment and demobilization work across the country, she assured all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army: We must further improve the work of preferential treatment and demobilization under the correct leadership of Party and government at all levels, and further support the nation's martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers to make greater contributions in the great cause of socialist construction.

Today's meeting adjourned at 4:30 p.m., and the conference will continue on the 19th.

    永远站在革命和建设最前线
    全国烈军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人积极分子大会开幕
    新华社18日讯　全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人、退伍军人、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会今天开幕。
    这次大会是内务部和中国人民解放军总政治部联合召开的。大会向全国烈属、军属和残废军人、复员军人、退伍军人、转业军人发出号召：要发扬革命传统，鼓足更大干劲，永远站在革命和建设的最前线；要在今年的增产节约运动中，进一步发挥积极作用，为完成和超额完成以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的1959年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    出席大会的有一千零八十八名社会主义建设积极分子，七十一名拥军优属工作先进单位的代表，还有解放军的代表等。在社会主义建设积极分子中，有曾经爬雪山、过草地、现在又誉满乡里的老红军战士，有在各个战线上发扬革命传统不断创造新成绩的复员军人、退伍军人和转业军人，有一心向着党的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，有充满革命乐观主义精神的残废军人。
    下午三时，大会主席、中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇宣布开会，北京市一群少先队员，代表首都儿童向大会献花，并朗读了贺词。
    接着，内务部部长钱瑛向大会作报告。她在报告中着重地谈到了全国烈属、军属和残废军人、复员军人、退伍军人、转业军人去年大跃进以来在祖国各个战线上作出的巨大成绩。她说，在1957年冬季和1958年春天，各级党委提出了农田水利化、确保农业大丰收的战斗任务以后，全国各地的复员、退伍、转业军人和有劳动能力的烈属、军属、残废军人，个个精神奋发，投入了农田水利建设的高潮。他们积极勇敢，不怕艰险，不畏困难，无论在艰巨的工程中，或在险要的地段上，都是一支生力军。另外，他们在改良土壤、积肥造肥、合理密植、田间管理和种植高产试验田等一系列的农业丰产运动中，也都作出了不少的贡献，在全民大办工业的运动中，他们的热情也是很高的。很多地区的复员军人几乎全部参加了这个运动。全国大部分地区，都有烈属、军属和复员军人兴办的以“八一”命名的工厂。根据七个省的统计，以烈属、军属和复员、退伍、转业军人为主而兴办的中小型工厂，就有六万三千八百一十九个。在技术革命和技术革新中，他们也同样作出了不小的贡献。据山西省的统计，全省烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍军人，在1958年中，就创造、改良和仿制了各种农具八十多万件。四川省的烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍军人，在1958年创造和试制了各种农具一百一十五万多件。
    她强调指出，他们对于国家和人民所作出的贡献，是不能单单用在生产劳动中所创造的价值和劳动成果来加以估计的，更重要的是，他们对于革命事业那种始终如一的无限忠诚，在建设和保卫祖国方面所表现出的那种坚强的革命意志，在各项政治运动中的积极作用，对广大群众和人民军队有着极大的教育意义，是永远鼓舞人们前进的政治力量。
    她说，目前全国人民已经掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的全民性的增产节约运动，全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人，应当在这个运动中，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划而奋斗。她希望到会代表今后要继续高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗，奋勇前进；要谦虚谨慎，团结群众，共同前进，要进一步提高政治思想觉悟，发扬共产主义风格；要听党的话，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，用更好更辉煌的成绩迎接国庆十周年，为祖国的社会主义建设贡献出更大的力量。
    钱瑛在报告中还赞扬了参加大会的拥军优属工作先进单位所做出的成绩。她代表内务部和全国从事优抚、复员工作的同志，向人民解放军全体官兵保证：我们一定要在各级党政的正确领导下，进一步做好优抚、复员工作，进一步支持全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人在伟大的社会主义建设事业中作出更大的贡献。
    今天的会议在下午四时半休会，大会将在19日继续举行。
