Unearthing Potential from Steel, Coal, Grain, Cotton, and Oil: Shandong Determines Main Direction for Increased Production and Thrift

(Our Dispatch from Jinan, May 26th) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a broadcast conference, mobilizing cadres and people throughout the province to immediately take action and launch a mass movement for increased production and thrift.

Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee, delivered a mobilization report at the conference. He said, "After the Great Leap Forward last year, have we reached the peak of increased production and exhausted all potential? Is there still production to be increased, materials to be conserved, and potential to be tapped? It should be acknowledged that there is still significant potential for increased production and thrift in all areas. For example, in steel production, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces is still not very high, averaging only about 0.8 in the province. If the average utilization coefficient is universally raised to 1.5, the annual increase in production can be about 1.2 million tons, which is almost equivalent to 80% of the province's production this year. If the oil yield of vegetable oil can be increased by 1%, the province can increase oil production by 15,800 tons. If coal can be comprehensively utilized, based on the calculation of 9.35 million tons of coal for smelting 5.5 million tons of iron, the value of recovering only three items—crude tar, ammonium sulfate, and benzene—can reach 63.34 million yuan. If industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province can reduce costs by 1%, the annual increase in income can be more than 20 million yuan. If the province can focus on doing a good job in the later stages of management of wheat, carefully harvesting and threshing, and returning the grains to the home, achieving an increase of ten to twenty catties per mu, it can increase grain production by 500 million to 1 billion catties. If everyone in the province saves one liang of grain per day, the annual saving can be more than 1.2 billion catties. This shows that, from whatever aspect we look at it, the potential is very great. As long as we are good at fully tapping these potentials, there is much we can do."

Next, Comrade Shu Tong put forward the general requirements for the current increased production and thrift movement in Shandong Province, which is to universally and effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, further boost morale, fully tap all potential forces that can be tapped, rationally allocate and use all manpower, materials, and financial resources, improve labor productivity, increase production, increase income, improve quality, reduce costs, overcome all extravagance and waste, and better fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan. In particular, the major indicators of steel, iron, coal, grain, cotton, and oil must be taken as the main direction of this movement, and all effective measures must be taken to ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of these targets.

    从钢铁煤粮棉油中大挖潜力
    山东确定增产节约主攻方向
    本报济南26日电  中共山东省委最近举行广播大会，动员全省干部和人民，立即行动起来，开展一个全民性的增产节约运动。
    山东省委第一书记舒同同志在会上做了动员报告。他说：“经过去年的大跃进，是不是已经到了增产到顶、潜力挖尽的程度呢？我们是不是还有产可增、有物可节、有潜力可挖呢？应该承认，目前各方面的增产节约的潜力还是很大的。例如，在钢铁生产中，高炉的利用系数还不很高，全省平均只达到零点八左右，如将平均利用系数普遍提高到一点五的水平，全年可增产一百二十万吨左右，几乎相当于全省今年产量的80％。植物油的出油率如能提高1％，全省即可增产油一万五千八百吨。煤炭如能采取综合利用，按炼五百五十万吨铁用煤九百三十五万吨计算，仅回收焦油、硫酸铵、粗苯三项的价值，即可达六千三百三十四万元。全省工矿企业如能降低成本1％，全年就可增加收入二千余万元。全省的小麦，如能抓紧做好后期管理工作，精收细打，颗粒还家，做到每亩多收十斤到二十斤，就可以增产五亿到十亿斤粮食。全省每人每日节约一两粮食，全年就可以节约粮食十二亿多斤。这就说明：无论从哪一方面来看，潜力都是很大的。只要我们善于将这些潜力充分挖掘出来，是大有可为的”。
    接着，舒同同志提出了当前山东省增产节约运动的总要求，就是要普遍而有效地调动广大群众的积极性，进一步鼓足干劲，充分挖掘一切可挖掘的潜在力量，合理调度和使用一切人力、物力、财力，提高劳动生产率，增加生产，增加收入，提高质量，降低成本，克服一切铺张浪费现象，更好地完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划。特别是钢、铁、煤、粮、棉、油几大指标，必须作为这个运动的主攻方向，采取一切有效措施，确保完成和超额完成。
