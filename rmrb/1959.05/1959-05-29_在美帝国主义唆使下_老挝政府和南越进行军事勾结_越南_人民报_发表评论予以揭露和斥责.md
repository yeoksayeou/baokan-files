Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 28th: Vietnam’s "People's Daily" today published a commentary entitled "The Illegal Alliance Must Be Immediately Cancelled," condemning the recent collusion between the Lao government and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique, further instigated by U.S. imperialism.

The commentary said: Recently, representatives of the Phoui Sananikone government and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique secretly negotiated in Saigon and concluded many "agreements." According to foreign news agencies, the most noteworthy of these agreements is the "cooperation of military forces" between South Vietnam and Laos. The collusion between the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities and the Phoui Sananikone government has become a military alliance aimed at opposing the people of Vietnam and Laos and undermining peace in Indochina.

The commentary said that with the encouragement of U.S. imperialism, the collusion between the South Vietnamese and Lao authorities has a long history. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique openly supported the Lao Royal Army in invading the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam – the Huong Lap area. The Phoui Sananikone government also allowed the U.S.-Ngo clique's spy organization to conduct sabotage activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Lao territory close to the North Vietnamese border.

The commentary pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had long accepted the scheme of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, preparing to engage in a military alliance with Laos. In January 1959, when the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in coordination with pro-American forces in Laos, created a tense situation on the Vietnam-Laos border, it demanded "a strong increase in forces near the central and lower Laos regions," and demanded that all possible means be used to draw the strength of South Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "to fill the blank area from the coast of central Vietnam to the Mekong River" (according to Saigon's "National Revolution Daily" on January 15th this year). They also openly clamored to strengthen the intervention forces of the Southeast Asia Group, and announced that "other alliance forms besides the Southeast Asia alliance form are necessary and should be approved" (see Saigon's "National Revolution Daily" on January 10th). Recently, the "agreements" concluded by the representatives of Ngo Dinh Diem and Phoui Sananikone are one of these so-called "other alliance forms." The conclusion of these "agreements" is clearly a new step in the conspiracy of civil war planned by U.S. imperialism and its pawns.

The commentary pointed out that, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government provoked a civil war in Laos, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique carried out large-scale "mopping-up operations" in South Vietnam, and the "military alliance" between South Vietnam and Laos has made the situation in Indochina even more serious. U.S. imperialism will use this "alliance" to strengthen military intervention in Laos from South Vietnam, strengthen new provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and harass the borders of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese people resolutely oppose any form of military collusion between the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities and the Phoui Sananikone government, and resolutely oppose their actions that violate the Geneva Accords and undermine peace.

    在美帝国主义唆使下
    老挝政府和南越进行军事勾结
    越南“人民报”发表评论予以揭露和斥责
    新华社河内28日电　越南“人民报”今天发表题为“必须立刻取消非法的联盟”的评论，谴责老挝政府和南越吴庭艳集团最近在美帝国主义唆使下进一步进行勾结。
    评论说：最近，培·萨纳尼空政府和吴庭艳集团的代表在西贡秘密谈判，缔结了许多“协定”。据外国通讯社透露，这些协定中最值得注意的是南越同老挝之间的“军事力量的合作”，吴庭艳当局同培·萨纳尼空政府的勾结已变成一种军事联盟，目的在于反对越南和老挝人民，破坏印度支那的和平。
    评论说，在美帝国主义的怂恿下，南越和老挝当局的勾结由来已久。吴庭艳集团曾经明目张胆地支持老挝王国军队侵犯越南民主共和国领土——向立地区。而培·萨纳尼空政府也让美吴集团的间谍组织在紧靠着北越边境一带的老挝领土上，对越南民主共和国进行破坏活动。
    评论指出，吴庭艳集团很久以前就接受了东南亚条约集团的计谋，准备同老挝搞军事联盟。1959年1月间，吴庭艳集团在同老挝亲美势力配合制造越老边境的紧张局势的时候，它就曾经要求“大力增强靠近中、下寮地区的力量”，要求尽一切可能设法把南越和东南亚条约组织的力量抽调“来填满从中越海岸到湄公河沿岸的空白地区”（据西贡“国家革命报”今年1月15日报道）。它们还公开叫嚣加强东南亚集团的干涉力量，并宣布“除东南亚联盟形式以外的其他联盟形式都有必要而且应该赞成”（见西贡1月10日“国家革命报”）。最近，吴庭艳和培·萨纳尼空的代表所缔结的“协定”就是这种所谓“其他联盟形式”之一。这些“协定”的缔结，显然是美帝国主义及其爪牙所策划的内战阴谋中新的一步。
    评论指出，在美帝国主义的唆使下，培·萨纳尼空政府在老挝挑起内战，吴庭艳集团在南越进行大规模“扫荡”，南越同老挝的“军事联盟”已使印度支那的局势变得更加严重。美帝国主义将利用这种“联盟”来加强从南越对老挝进行军事干涉，加强对越南民主共和国进行新的挑衅和骚扰柬埔寨王国的边境。
    评论说，越南人民坚决反对吴庭艳当局同培·萨纳尼空政府之间在任何形式下的军事勾结，坚决反对他们违反日内瓦协议和破坏和平的行为。
