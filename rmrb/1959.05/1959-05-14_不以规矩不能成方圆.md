    Without rules, there can be no squares or circles.

    In doing anything, there must be certain rules. Rules and regulations, to put it simply, are the rules for doing things. Following bad "rules" will not lead to good results; following "old rules" will not accomplish new things; "rules" must also change according to the needs of changing objective circumstances. But no matter how they change, there must be "rules" in any situation, and this point is unchangeable. The same is true of rules and regulations in factories and enterprises.

    However, rules and regulations must be adapted to the needs of the economic base and the development of productive forces. Whether they have a good or bad effect on production depends on whether they correctly reflect the objective laws of the production process in the enterprise, as well as the relationships between people in labor within the enterprise. Because the production situation of an enterprise is constantly changing and developing, and people's practical experience in production is constantly being improved and enriched, the rules and regulations of the enterprise are often in a state of being both adapted and unadapted to the actual situation of production development. In dealing with the rules and regulations in an enterprise, one must grasp the principle of "destroying and establishing, seeking establishment in destruction," neither regarding the rules and regulations as solidified, unchanging things, nor ignoring the indispensable and important role that reasonable rules and regulations play in organizing production and promoting production.

    Last year's massive destruction of unreasonable rules and regulations became an important factor in promoting the great leap forward in production. This reflected the objective requirements of production development. Since the rectification movement, the productive forces of enterprises have developed rapidly, the mass production movement has flourished, and the democratization of enterprise management has been further expanded. These new situations have led to increasingly sharp contradictions with some backward and outdated aspects of the original enterprise rules and regulations. Without a major destruction, the contradiction between the rules and regulations lagging behind the development of production cannot be resolved, which would hinder the development of production and restrain the enthusiasm of the masses. The main problem at present is: after the major destruction, we must emphasize major establishment. Because abolishing and modifying unreasonable or not completely reasonable rules and regulations does not mean that we do not need any rules and regulations, nor does it mean that after breaking the old, we will not establish the new. From the perspective of the enterprise, although some enterprises paid attention to establishing while destroying during the major destruction last year, and established many reasonable rules and regulations necessary for production; in other enterprises, in some specific production links, there was a situation of more destruction and less establishment, or relaxation of establishment after destruction. Although this was difficult to completely avoid in the situation of major destruction, it is not good, and if we do not pay attention to improving it in time, it will be detrimental to the progress of production.

### 不以规矩不能成方圆

    不以规矩不能成方圆
    办任何事情，总得有一定的规矩。规章制度，通俗点讲，也就是办事的规矩。按坏“规矩”办事，办不成好事；按“老规矩”办事，办不了新事；根据客观情况变化的需要，“规矩”也得有变动。但不管怎么变，在任何情况下都得有“规矩”，这一点是变不了的。工厂企业中的规章制度同样也是如此。
    但是，规章制度一定要适合经济基础和生产力发展的需要。它对生产起好作用还是起坏作用，却要看它是否正确地反映了企业生产过程中的客观规律，以及企业内部人与人之间在劳动中的相互关系。由于企业生产情况是在不断地变化和发展着的，人们生产实践的经验也是不断地完善和丰富起来的，企业规章制度与生产发展的实际情况之间，就经常地处于又适应、又不适应的状况中。对待企业中的规章制度，就得掌握
  “有破有立、破中求立”的原则，既不能把规章制度看成是凝固不化、一成不变的东西，又不能忽视合理的规章制度对于组织生产、推动生产所起的必不可少的重要作用。
    去年大破不合理的规章制度，成为推动生产大跃进的一个重要因素。这样做，正是反映着生产发展的客观要求。由于整风运动以后，企业生产力迅速发展，群众生产运动蓬勃展开，企业管理民主化进一步扩大，这些新的情况与原来企业规章制度中某些落后了的、过时了的环节，发生了愈来愈尖锐的矛盾，不经过大破，就不能解决规章制度落后于生产发展的矛盾，就会妨碍生产的发展与束缚群众的积极性。当前的主要问题是：经过大破之后，必须强调大立。因为，废除和修改不合理的、不完全合理的规章制度，绝不等于不要一切规章制度，也不等于破旧之后，不再立新。从企业的情况来看，固然有一部分企业在去年大破的同时，就注意到边破边立，建立起不少为生产所必需的合理的规章制度；而在另一部分企业中，在某些具体的生产环节上，也有破得多、立得少，或是破了之后放松立的状况，这在大破的形势下虽是难于完全避免的，但这是不好的，如果不及时注意改进，就会不利于生产的进行。
