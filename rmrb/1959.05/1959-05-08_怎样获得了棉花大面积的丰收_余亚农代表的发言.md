How We Achieved a Large-Scale Bumper Harvest of Cotton
Speech by Representative Yu Yanong

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, agree with the reports of the Vice Premiers, and agree with the report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I will give a brief report to the congress on the situation of cotton yield and improved living standards in the Fuxing People's Commune of Chaoxian County, Anhui Province.

Tens of Millions of Dan of "White Snow" Harvested, Cotton Piles Higher Than the Ninth Heaven

The Fuxing People's Commune is a cotton-producing area. It has a total of 11,168 households and 41,501 people. Since the planting of Daizi cotton began in 1954, although cotton production has increased year by year, the average yield per mu has not been very high. In 1957, the average yield per mu here was less than 70 jin of ginned cotton. However, in 1958, when the People's Commune was established, an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton was achieved. The entire commune planted 21,965 mu of cotton (accounting for 51 percent of the cultivated land area), and harvested a total of 13,398,650 jin of ginned cotton. The average yield per mu was 610 jin of ginned cotton. This was an increase of nearly eight times compared to the average yield per mu in 1957, and an increase of more than fourteen times compared to the average yield per mu in 1954 and 1955. Among them, 2,100 mu of cotton fields yielded 1,500 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and 139 mu yielded 2,352 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Ten production teams with 1,100 jin of ginned cotton per mu emerged. The commune members happily sang self-composed folk songs to celebrate the bumper cotton harvest. They sang: "Clear streams and blue skies, green cotton fields stretching as far as the eye can see; tens of millions of dan of 'white snow' harvested, cotton piles higher than the ninth heaven."

The large cotton harvest greatly increased the income of commune members and significantly improved their lives. Not counting the income from sideline occupations of commune members' families, each household in the entire commune received an average of 621.4 yuan, each labor force member received an average of 389.9 yuan, and each person received an average of 167.2 yuan, more than double the amount in 1957. In other words, the income of one commune member in 1958 was more than the income of two commune members in 1957. The Liucun Village of the Liuding Brigade, which had the largest increase in production in this commune, had more than 200 households, with an average income of more than 1,000 yuan per household (excluding welfare and family sideline income), and many households with more labor forces had an income of more than 1,500 yuan. For example, the family of poor peasant Liu Honggui had seven people. Before 1956, they were overspending every year. In 1958, the whole family received 1,277.6 yuan, transforming from an overspending household to a surplus household. When Liu Shi'an, an upper-middle peasant, was working individually, his family of eight had an income of only about 60 yuan per person per year. In 1958, his family's income was 1,622 yuan, or 202.75 yuan per person, which was more than twice as much as his income when he worked individually. With increased income, purchasing power also greatly improved. Almost every household in the commune purchased new quilts, new clothes, rubber shoes, thermos bottles, underwear, and other daily necessities. The business volume of the commune's supply and marketing cooperative and the Tongyin Town department store within the commune alone reached 704,200 yuan from October 1958 to February 1959. This was more than double the business volume of the same period last year. Many commune members also deposited unused money or temporarily unused money in banks, commune credit cooperatives, or invested in the commune. According to statistics, commune members deposited more than 492,000 yuan in banks and credit cooperatives, and invested 418,700 yuan in the commune.

The establishment of the People's Commune not only won a bumper harvest of cotton, increased the income of commune members, and improved their living standards, but also enabled cultural and educational undertakings and collective welfare undertakings to develop rapidly.

In terms of cultural and educational undertakings: in addition to establishing 29 primary schools, 3 junior high schools, and 1 agricultural high school, the commune and brigades have also established spare-time literacy schools and red-and-expert schools. The number of students enrolled increased sharply from 4,691 before the establishment of the commune to 6,650. All school-age children were enrolled, and some over-age children were also enrolled. All commune members and children have the opportunity to attend school. While learning culture, commune members also combined their learning with cotton planting techniques. Now, commune members throughout the commune have generally learned general cotton planting techniques, and many cadres and commune members have reached or are approaching the level of technicians. In terms of collective welfare: public canteens, homes for the elderly, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, laundry teams, barber shops, sewing teams, and shoe-making teams are located in every production team of the commune. In addition, the commune has also established a health hospital with five outpatient departments. The benefits brought to the commune members by these collective welfare undertakings are truly endless. For example, the establishment of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens freed more than 10,000 women in the commune from household chores such as taking care of children and cooking, enabling them to participate in productive labor like men, allowing women who had been subjugated to the stove for thousands of years to be completely liberated and smile with joy. At the same time, commune members no longer have to worry about eating, and they can eat hot dishes and hot meals every meal. They generally said: "Now we eat with oil and salt every day, and we eat hot meals every meal. Life is getting sweeter and sweeter." For example, in the past, if commune members got sick, they had to take a train to Hefei or Chaoxian to get treatment. Now, if they get a common illness, they can go to the commune health hospital for treatment, and if they get a minor illness, they can go to the outpatient department nearby. In particular, the establishment of maternity hospitals and homes for the elderly has greatly guaranteed the health of mothers and infants, and the lives of the elderly have been properly taken care of.

In the first year of the establishment of the commune, so many benefits have been brought to the commune members in terms of production and life. As a result, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members has increased a hundredfold, and their confidence in the Great Leap Forward has become even stronger. They believe that the great achievements made in various undertakings in 1958 are only the prelude to "three years of hard work to change the face of the countryside." Therefore, they are unanimously determined to raise the red flag of large-scale cotton production even higher this year, and to achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery than last year. They have formulated an ambitious production plan to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, a large-scale bumper harvest of 2,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and a high-yield harvest of 10,000 jin of seed cotton per mu; an average grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu; a net income of more than 10 million yuan from industry and sideline occupations; 50,000 collectively raised pigs, 50 pigs raised in each canteen, and 1 pig, 10 to 15 chickens, geese, and ducks raised by each commune member household, and other specific indicators. Now, the commune members of this commune have aroused soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and are launching a massive and vigorous production upsurge to realize this leap forward plan.

Why can the Fuxing People's Commune make such a great leap forward in one year? The main experiences are two:

First, adhering to putting politics in command and combining politics with technology is the key to winning a bumper harvest in production.

When the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, the commune party committee, in accordance with the instructions of the higher party committee, repeatedly educated the vast number of commune members on the general line of socialist construction. In the process of cotton planting, it also successively criticized and eliminated right-leaning conservative ideas such as "silted land cannot be planted with cotton," "cotton cannot be densely planted," and "cotton is set in stone after the Beginning of Autumn," as well as the mystical views held by some people on cotton planting techniques. On the basis of the general improvement of the political and ideological awareness of the masses and the enhancement of their confidence in the Great Leap Forward, they also timely organized the masses to launch an upsurge in learning advanced cotton planting techniques, and successively promoted "square-block seedling raising," "rational close planting," "staggered side pruning," "delayed topping," "pushing plants together and merging ridges," "separating plants to see the sun," "pouring flower water after rain," "picking residual flowers," "artificial pollination," "hanging fruit branches to prevent boll shedding and rotten peaches," "smoking to prevent frost," and other technical measures. From cotton sowing to harvesting, they suffered from thirteen serious natural disasters and pests and diseases, such as continuous rain in spring, 103 days of severe drought in summer, continuous rain and waterlogging in autumn, and cotton cutworms. They all adopted mutual support and collective cooperation to overcome them.

Second, the People's Commune was established.

As soon as the People's Commune was established, it immediately demonstrated its unparalleled superiority. There are two relatively clear examples in the Fuxing People's Commune that can illustrate this point:

1.  The contradiction between heavy workload and insufficient labor force was resolved.

In the autumn of 1958, when the cotton entered the harvesting season, it was also a relatively tense period for large-scale steelmaking and autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing. Several urgent tasks had to be completed within a certain period of time, and the labor force was felt to be very tight at the time. At this time, the Fuxing People's Commune was established, and collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens were also established with the establishment of the commune. The commune party committee made reasonable, unified arrangements and deployments for the labor force of the entire commune, and a large number of female laborers were liberated from household labor and fully invested in production, adding a large labor force to the commune, and the contradiction of insufficient labor force was readily solved. At that time, the commune party committee drew 40 percent of the labor force to make steel in large quantities and left 60 percent of the labor force to engage in agricultural production. The result was that steel production was able to proceed smoothly; late-stage management of cotton fields was strengthened in a timely manner and meticulous harvesting was achieved; and production tasks such as autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing were successfully completed in a timely manner, achieving a double bumper harvest of steel and cotton, and laying a good foundation for this year's grain and cotton production.

2.  Construction projects that could not be carried out before the establishment of the commune could be carried out quickly after the establishment of the commune.

The Jianlu Brigade and the Mingxing Brigade of the Fuxing People's Commune were two agricultural cooperatives in the past. They had long wanted to build two reservoirs near Tuanshan and Moshan to irrigate more than 20,000 mu of farmland and eliminate the threat of drought. However, due to the need for about 20,000 yuan in construction costs for these two reservoirs, more than 2.6 million cubic meters of earthwork, a large scale of the project, and their own insufficient strength, they were delayed. Not long after the establishment of the commune, due to the large number of people in the commune, strong strength, and abundant funds, these two reservoirs officially started construction last winter. Now, more than 4,000 commune members are working on the reservoir construction site. For example, the output value of the commune-run industry in the fourth quarter of 1958 reached 826,110 yuan, accounting for more than 71 percent of the total industrial output value in 1958. In just a few months after communization, 75 factories and mines such as cement factories, farm tool factories, textile factories, knitting factories, rayon factories, and dolomite mines were established, and most of them have been put into production. Among them, the mechanized textile factory with 1,500 spindles under construction needs 190,000 yuan for infrastructure and production equipment, and more than 1 million yuan for raw materials and other aspects of investment. It was unimaginable for agricultural cooperatives to run factories of this scale in the past.

The great achievements made by the Fuxing People's Commune in just a few months fully demonstrate the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune. In the future, as long as we earnestly implement the "Resolution on Certain Issues Concerning the People's Communes" of the Party Central Committee and other instructions concerning the People's Communes, continue to improve our work, and give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, its development prospects are unlimited. As the commune members said, "Land reform turned us over, collectivization dug out the roots of poverty, the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, and the establishment of the People's Commune, we will step by step ascend to paradise!"

　　怎样获得了棉花大面积的丰收
    余亚农代表的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，同意几位副总理的报告，同意彭真副委员长的报告。现在我将安徽省巢县复兴人民公社棉花丰产和生活改善的情况向大会作一简要的汇报。
    丰收“白雪”千万担  棉堆高过九重天
    复兴人民公社是个产棉区。共有一万一千一百六十八户，四万一千五百零一人。自一九五四年开始种植岱字棉以来，棉花产量虽然年年有所增长，但是平均亩产量还不是很高的。一九五七年，这里的平均亩产量不到七十斤皮棉。然而在建立人民公社的一九五八年，就赢得了棉花空前大丰收。全公社种植的二万一千九百六十五亩棉花（占耕地面积百分之五十一），一共收获了一千三百三十九万八千六百五十斤皮棉。平均每亩产皮棉六百一十斤。比一九五七年平均亩产量增长了近八倍，比一九五四、一九五五年的平均亩产量增长了十四倍以上。其中有两千一百亩棉田亩产皮棉一千五百斤，有一百三十九亩亩产皮棉二千三百五十二斤，并涌现出了十个一千一百斤皮棉的生产队。社员们欢乐地唱着自编的歌谣，来庆贺棉花大丰收。他们唱道：“清清的流水蓝蓝的天，绿油油的棉海望不到边；丰收‘白雪’千万担，棉堆高过九重天”。
    棉花大丰收，使社员们收入大大增加，生活得到了显著改善。除去社员家庭副业收入不算，全公社平均每户分到了六百二十一元四角，平均每个劳力分到三百八十九元九角，平均每人分到一百六十七元二角，比一九五七年增加一倍以上。也就是说一九五八年一个社员的收入比一九五七年两个社员的收入还多。这个公社增产最多的刘町大队的刘町村，共有二百多户，平均每户收入在一千元以上（还未包括福利事业和家庭副业的收入），有不少劳力较多的户收入在一千五百元以上。譬如，贫农刘宏贵家共有七口人，一九五六年以前年年是超支户，一九五八年全家分到一千二百七十七元六角，由超支户一变为余款户。上中农刘士安在单干时，全家八口人每人每年收入只有六十元左右，一九五八年全家收入一千六百二十二元，每人合二百零二元七角五分，比单干时的收入多出两倍以上。收入多了，购买力也较前大为提高。全公社几乎家家都购置了新被、新衣、胶鞋、热水瓶、卫生衣等日用品。仅公社供销部和公社范围内的桐荫镇百货营业所两处在一九五八年十月到一九五九年二月五个月的营业额，就达七十万四千二百多元。比上一年同期的营业额增长了两倍多。很多社员还将用不完的钱或暂时不用的钱，存入银行、公社信用部或向公社投资。据统计，社员们存入银行和信用部的款子有四十九万二千多元，向公社投资达四十一万八千七百多元。
    成立了人民公社，不仅赢得了棉花大丰收，增加了社员收入，改善了社员生活，而且使文化教育事业和集体福利事业也跟着迅速地发展起来。
    在文教事业方面：全公社除办起了二十九所小学、三所初级中学和一所农业中学外，公社和大队还都设有业余民校和红专学校。入学人数由成立公社前的四千六百九十一人，陡增到六千六百五十人，学龄儿童全部入了学，还有一部分超龄儿童也入了学。所有社员和儿童都有入校学习的机会。社员们在学习文化的同时，还结合学习了植棉技术。现在全社社员普遍学会了一般植棉技术，有不少干部和社员已达到或接近技术员的水平。在集体福利事业方面：公共食堂、敬老院、托儿所、幼儿园、妇产院、洗衣组、理发室、缝纫组、做鞋组遍布全公社各个生产队。此外，公社还建立了一所健康医院，设有五个门诊部。这些集体福利事业的兴办，给社员们带来的好处真是说不尽。譬如，办起了公共食堂和托儿所、幼儿园，就使得全社有一万多个妇女摆脱了带孩子、做饭等家务劳动，能和男子一样参加生产劳动，使得几千年屈伏在锅灶旁边的妇女得到了彻底的解放而笑逐颜开。同时，社员们可以不再在吃饭问题上操心，餐餐吃到热菜热饭。他们普遍这样说：“如今天天有油有盐吃，餐餐有热气腾腾的饭菜吃，真是越过越甜。”又如，过去社员们生了病要搭火车到合肥、巢县才能治疗，如今，生一般病可进公社健康医院治疗，生小病则就近到门诊部就能治好。特别是妇产院和敬老院的建立，使妇婴健康有了很大保障，使老人们的生活都得到了妥善的照顾。
    建立公社的第一年，就给社员们在生产上生活上带来这许许多多好处，因而，社员们的革命干劲百倍增长，跃进信心愈加坚定。他们认为：一九五八年各项事业所取得的巨大成绩，只不过是“苦战三年，改变农村面貌”的序幕，所以，他们万众一心地决心在今年内把棉花大面积丰产红旗举得更高，使农、林、副、渔业来个比去年更大更全面的跃进。他们已制订出了一个宏伟的生产规划，要在今年内实现平均亩产皮棉一千斤，大面积丰产皮棉双千斤，高额丰产籽棉一万斤；粮食平均亩产两千斤；工业和副业纯收入达到一千万元以上；集体养猪五万头，每个食堂养猪五十头，每户社员养猪一头、鸡鹅鸭十至十五只等具体指标。现在，这个公社的社员们已鼓起了冲天的革命干劲，为实现这个跃进规划而掀起了一个声势浩大、轰轰烈烈的生产热潮。
    为什么复兴人民公社一年就能这样大跃进呢？主要的经验有两条：
    第一、坚持政治挂帅，政治与技术相结合，是赢得生产大丰收的关键。
    当一九五八年大跃进开始时，公社党委就根据上级党委的指示，反复地向广大社员进行了社会主义建设总路线的教育。在植棉过程中，又先后批判、破除了“淤土地不能种植棉花”、“棉花不能密植”、“棉花立秋后便成定局”等右倾保守思想和部分群众对植棉技术所持的神秘观点。在群众政治思想觉悟普遍提高、跃进信心增强的基础上，又及时地组织群众掀起一个学先进植棉技术的热潮，并先后推行了“方块育苗”、“合理密植”、“分期打边心”、“推迟打顶心”、“推株并垅”、“分株见阳”、“雨后倒花水”、“摘残花”、“人工授粉”、“吊果枝防脱铃烂桃”、“熏烟防霜冻”等等一系列技术措施。从棉花播种到收获，遭受了春季连天阴雨、夏季一百零三天大旱、秋季连雨阴涝和斜纹夜盗娥等十三种严重的自然灾害和病虫害，都是采取互相支援、集体协作的办法战胜了。
    第二、建立了人民公社。
    人民公社已经建立，就立即显示出它的无比优越性。在复兴人民公社有这样两件比较显明的事例可说明这一点：
    一、解决了活多与劳力不足的矛盾。
    一九五八年秋季，当棉花进入收摘季时，正是大办钢铁和秋收、秋耕、秋种比较紧张的时期，几件迫不及待的任务都要在一个时期内完成，当时劳力感到很紧张。就在这个时候，复兴人民公社建立起来了，公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业随着公社的建立也都兴办起来了。公社党委对全公社的劳力进行了合理的统一的安排和调度，加上大批的妇女劳力从家务劳动中解放出来，全力投入生产，给公社增添了一支劳动大军，劳力不足的矛盾也就迎刃而解。当时，公社党委抽了百分之四十的劳力大炼钢铁，留下了百分之六十的劳力从事农业生产。结果是：钢铁生产得以顺利进行；棉田后期管理得到了及时加强并做到了细收细摘；秋收、秋耕、秋种等生产任务都胜利地及时完成，既获得了钢铁、棉花双丰收，又为今年的粮、棉生产奠定了良好的基础。
    二、成立公社前不能举办的建设事业，在成立公社后能很快地举办起来。
    复兴人民公社的建麓大队和明星大队过去是两个农业社，它们很早就想在附近的团山、摩山等地兴建两座能灌溉两万多亩农田的水库，以解除干旱的威胁。但由于这两座水库需两万元左右建设费用，二百六十多万土方，工程规模大，自身力量又不足，因而拖延未办。公社建立后不久，由于公社人多、力量大、资金雄厚，这两座水库在去冬就正式动工了。现在，水库工地上有四千多名社员正在施工。又如，这个公社一九五八年第四季度社办工业的产值，达八十二万六千一百一十元，占一九五八年全年工业产值的百分之七十一强。在公社化以后短短的几个月里就办起了水泥厂、农具厂、纺织厂、针织厂、人造纤维厂、白云石矿等七十五个厂矿，大部分已投入生产。其中，正在兴建的拥有一千五百纱锭的机械化纺织厂，需要基建费和生产设备费十九万元，原材料等方面投资一百多万元，办这样规模的工厂，过去农业社是不能设想的。
    复兴人民公社在短短几个月内所取得的巨大成绩，充分显示了人民公社的强大生命力和无比的优越性。今后，只要认真贯彻党中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”以及其他有关人民公社的指示，不断改进工作，充分发挥广大群众的革命积极性，它的发展前途是不可限量的。正如社员所说的那样：“土地改革翻了身，合作化挖掉穷根，一九五八年生产大跃进，又办起了人民公社，我们就要一步一步地登上天堂了！”
