    The Deep Pain of British Youth
    Li Yichuan
    Currently, British youth are generally worried and uneasy about employment problems. Unemployment haunts them like a persistent ghost.
    Across Britain, approximately two hundred thousand young people are currently without work, lingering in front of labor exchanges. In Liverpool alone, over seven thousand young people aged fifteen to twenty-four were registered at the labor exchange in February, some of whom have been unemployed for over a year. The situation is similar in other cities. As for students just graduating from school, finding employment is even more difficult. This year, seven hundred and seventy thousand people will be leaving school, and a considerable portion of them will go directly to the labor exchange to stand in line. In High Bradford, Yorkshire, Youth Employment Officer Walter said: This summer, 906 students will graduate in the area, but only 80 boys and 200 girls will be able to find work. Because, go to the coal mines? The coal mines are closing. Go to the textile mills? The government only announced a plan on April 23 to "help the cotton industry," but in reality, this is a plan to subsidize the dismantling of "surplus production capacity." Existing workers will still lose their jobs, and young people have even less hope of finding work in this industry. Go to the shipbuilding industry? The entire capitalist world's shipping industry is in a slump, and Britain's shipping industry is no exception. In the steel and machinery industries, operations are generally insufficient, and existing workers can only work four days a week. They face a bleak prospect.
    University graduates have also encountered the so-called "excess" and "tight market" problems. According to statistics from four institutions that introduce science and engineering students to jobs: Last year, they needed 431 university students, but this year they only need 279. Even the demand for engineering and technical students at Oxford University has decreased by one-third. The person in charge of job placement at Oxford University said:
  “It is expected that this trend will continue. If science students continue to increase, we will definitely bring trouble upon ourselves.” But in reality, even when calculated proportionally, Britain has far fewer university students than the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, one in every 160 people is a university student; in Britain, only one in every 600 people is.
    Capitalism brings young people not only worries about work and a sense of insecurity about their future, but also makes them direct victims of this decaying and declining society. The bourgeoisie's rotten lifestyle constantly tempts innocent young people to embark on the path of crime and depravity. From childhood, the bourgeoisie shows them comic strips of murder and robbery; when they are older, they watch obscene and thieving movies and television; newspapers are filled with sensational crime news - all of this cannot but leave indelible bad influences on the pure minds of young people, making them think that "murder and crime are an integral part of life." In addition, coupled with instability in life and the threat of imperialist atomic war propaganda, young people see no future in capitalist society. The "Reynold News" said: Today's young generation's motto is: "To hell with everything, eat, drink, and be merry, tomorrow we die." In this way, crime becomes their inevitable way out, thus giving rise to the so-called "crime wave." Indeed, the number of juvenile delinquents has been rising. In 1957, there were more than 530,000 offenders, and 77% of the offenders were young people under the age of 30; in 1958, there were more than 626,000 offenders, an increase of 14.8% compared to 1957. Although there are no detailed statistics on crime at present, "the figures for the first three quarters of 1958 show that the number of crimes committed by young people aged 14 to 21 has increased the most" (Butler's parliamentary speech). In 1957, the number of violent crimes committed by young people aged 17 to 21 was eleven times that of 1938. Moral depravity can also be seen from the following figure: According to the "Daily Express," "one in six girls is pregnant before marriage."
    In order to eliminate the dissatisfaction of young people with the capitalist system, the British ruling class, in addition to ideologically corrupting them and guiding young people not to consider serious political issues, also uses various organizations to win over young people. There are about 400 youth organizations in the UK, with large organizations having millions of members and small organizations having only dozens of members. Except for six youth organizations that say they are political organizations, the rest claim not to be involved in politics, "politics is a dirty business." The largest of these is the church youth organization, which is also the largest youth organization in the UK. But it is this church organization, which believes that "politics is a dirty business," that demands that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization be armed with nuclear weapons and carry out anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda. In order to prevent young people from stepping out of "the norm," many churches even allow young people to dance rock and roll in "holy" chapels.
    However, pornographic films, rock and roll, and the daydream of "not asking about politics" - after all, it is impossible to eliminate the dissatisfaction of young people with reality. Life itself forces them to think about various issues and draw their own conclusions. Now, more young people are participating in the struggle to defend peace and defend their vital interests. For example, in the largest march against the hydrogen bomb from Aldermaston to London at the end of March, 70% were young people. Recently, young students have also held demonstrations against the colonialists' white terror in South Africa and against racial discrimination. It is obviously not easy for the British ruling class to quell their dissatisfaction with the capitalist system and block the path of young people's progress.

    英国青年的深沉痛苦
    李一川
    目前英国青年普遍为工作问题而忧虑不安。失业像不散的幽灵一样缠扰着他们。
    全英国目前大约有二十余万青年没有工作可作，徘徊在劳动介绍所门前。只利物浦一个城市，2月份十五岁到二十四岁的青年在劳动介绍所登记的已达七千余人，有些人已失业一年多了。其他城市也差不多。至于刚从学校出来的学生，就业就更困难。今年有七十七万人要走出学校，而其中相当大部分人会直接走到劳动介绍所去排队。在约克郡的希腊佛富德，青年就业介绍人沃特尔说：该地今年夏季有九百零六名学生毕业，只有八十个男孩和二百个女孩可以找到工作。因为，到煤矿去吗？煤井要关闭了。到纺织厂吗？4月23日政府才公布了一个关于“帮助棉纺业”计划，而实际上这是一个津贴拆除“剩余生产能力”的计划，现在的工人还要失业，青年到这个工业去找工作更没有希望了。到造船业吗？资本主义世界整个的航运业都处于萧条中，英国的航运业更不能例外。在钢铁、机械工业中，开工普遍不足，现有的工人一星期只能工作四天。他们面临的是一幅黯淡的前景。
    大学毕业生也发生了所谓“过剩”、“市场太紧”问题。根据对四个介绍理工大学生工作的机构的统计：去年它们需求的大学生是四百三十一名，今年只有二百七十九名；甚至对牛津大学工程技术学生的需求也减少了三分之一。牛津大学负责介绍工作的人说：
  “预计这种倾向还会继续下去。假如理科学生继续增加的话，我们肯定会给自己带来麻烦”。但是实际上，即使按人口比例算，英国的大学生也比苏联的大学生要少得多。苏联一百六十人中，就有一名大学生；英国六百人中才有一名。
    资本主义给青年带来的不仅是对工作的忧虑，对前途的不安之感，而且还使他们成为这个腐朽和没落的社会的直接牺牲品。资产阶级的腐烂的生活方式，时时在诱惑着天真的青年走上犯罪堕落的道路。从儿童时候起，资产阶级就给他们看那些谋杀、抢劫的连环漫画；再大一点，看的是诲淫诲盗的电影和电视；报纸上连篇累牍地登载着耸人听闻的犯罪消息——这一切不能不在纯洁的少年的心灵上留下难以消逝的坏影响，使他们认为“谋杀和犯罪是生活中不可分割的一部分”。此外，再加上生活上的不稳定，帝国主义原子战争宣传的威胁，青年们在资本主义社会中看不到任何前途。“雷诺新闻”说：今天青年一代的座右铭是：“管它三七二十一，吃了、喝了、作乐，到明天我们去死”。这样犯罪就成了他们必然的出路，因而出现了所谓“犯罪潮”。的确，青少年的犯罪数字一直在上升中，1957年犯罪者达五十三万余人，77％的犯罪者都是三十岁以下的青年；1958年犯罪者达到六十二万六千余人，比1957年增加14.8％。目前虽还没有犯罪情况的详细统计，但是“1958年前三季度的数字表明：十四岁至二十一岁青年犯罪数增长最大”（巴特勒议会发言）。1957年十七岁到二十一岁青年犯暴行罪的数字是1938年的十一倍。道德的败坏还可以从这样一个数字中看出来：根据“每日快报”说，“六分之一的姑娘在结婚以前就已怀孕”。
    为了消除青年对资本主义制度的不满，英国的统治阶级除了从思想上腐蚀他们并且引导青年不去考虑严肃的政治问题以外，还以各种组织来笼络青年。全英国有四百左右青年组织，大的组织会员有几百万，小的组织会员只有几十个。除过六个青年组织说自己是一种政治组织外，其余的都标榜不过问政治，“政治是脏事情”。其中最大的是教会青年组织，也是全英国最大的一个青年组织。但是也就是这个认为“政治是脏事情”的教会组织，却要求北大西洋公约组织用核武器武装起来，并进行反苏反共的宣传。为了防止青年越出“常规”，好多教会甚至让青年到“圣洁的”礼拜堂里去跳摇摆舞。
    但是，黄色电影、摇摆舞、“不问政治”的梦呓——毕竟不可能消除青年对现实的不满。生活的本身迫使他们去思索各种问题，并得出自己的结论。现在，有更多的青年参加到保卫和平和保卫切身利益的斗争中去。例如，3月底从阿得马斯顿到伦敦的最大的一次反对氢弹游行中，70％是青年。最近青年学生又举行了反对殖民主义者在南非的白色恐怖、反对种族歧视的游行示威。英国统治阶级要想平息他们对资本主义制度的不满，堵塞青年前进的道路，显然不是很容易的。
