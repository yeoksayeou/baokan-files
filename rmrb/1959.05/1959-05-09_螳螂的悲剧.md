　　The Tragedy of the Mantis
　　Lin Mohan

　　In a few months, the People's Republic of China will be ten years old. Ten years, from the perspective of the entire history of mankind, is an almost insignificant instant. However, the Chinese people, who have taken control of their own destiny, have completed in this short decade brilliant achievements that could not have been accomplished in the past few centuries. Our brothers and friends are sincerely happy for our achievements; but there are also a small handful of fellows who are hostile to us, and the greater our achievements, the more uncomfortable they become.

　　What can be done? The development of real life always goes against their evil wishes. Looking at the attitude they have adopted towards the People's Republic of China is very interesting. They originally spent tens of billions of dollars to support a corrupt group that the Chinese people deeply hated, fully expecting that this would extinguish the Chinese revolution. However, the result was contrary to their expectations. The Chinese people were victorious, and the new China rose like the sun in the morning on the eastern horizon. Initially, they were in a panic, followed by mutual recriminations, and later they adopted the method they have always used to deal with revolutionary countries, called "non-recognition." Of course, their sinister activities aimed at strangling the People's Republic of China have been going on overtly and covertly all along.

　　"Non-recognition" is the most stupid way for all stubborn old forces to deal with truth and new things. They think that as long as they don't recognize it, the fact will cease to exist. However, the unlucky ones are not others, but precisely those who do not recognize the facts. They will eventually have their heads broken by the facts, while truth and new things will continue to advance by overcoming all obstacles.

　　As everyone knows, the Vatican once refused to recognize that the earth revolves around the sun. They regarded this truth as heresy, and even burned alive those who promoted this truth. But what was the use? The earth still revolves around the sun. As everyone also knows, British Emperor George III once refused to recognize a newly emerging country—the United States of America. In his mind, there was no United States in the world at all; there was only a colony of his in America. But what was the use of that? Regardless of whether George III recognized it or not, the United States was still an objective existence.

　　It is said that even monkeys know to avoid repeating the same mistake when they see other monkeys fall into a mud pit. The minds of American political leaders seem to be inferior to those of monkeys. Not only have they not learned useful lessons from George III's foolish behavior, but they have inherited George III's mantle, learning George III's way of dealing with the United States to deal with other newly born countries. They once refused to recognize the great Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union not only exists, but has become the most powerful country in the world. They stubbornly refuse to recognize the great People's Republic of China, and have been racking their brains to undermine this country. But what is the result? The People's Republic of China not only stands still, but is becoming increasingly powerful.

　　This has put the American masters in a very ridiculous and embarrassing situation. They do not recognize the new China, but they insist on provoking it and clashing with it, and as a result, they are beaten black and blue by the object they do not recognize, and they even have to hold negotiations with the object they do not recognize again and again. The Spanish "Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance" regarded windmills as giants, making a joke of fighting windmills, and finally suffering a great deal; but the madmen of Wall Street do not recognize the real giants—the irresistible revolutionary forces. They stretch out their arms like mantises, dreaming of blocking the advance of the wheels of history. What can the result be other than becoming a laughingstock? The motives and purposes of the Spanish "Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance" and the Wall Street madmen are completely different, but the problem is the same, due to derangement.

　　It seems that even within the American ruling group, there are some people who feel that this policy is foolish and ridiculous. Not long ago, Senator Fulbright, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, complained: "Our foreign policy is inadequate, outdated, and misdirected. Part of the basis of this policy is a misestimation of the situation in the world we live in. Worse, it reflects a dangerous apathy and an incomprehensible reluctance to face facts." (February 13, "U.S. News & World Report")

　　Even though they are "reluctant to face the facts," the facts are forcing them to open their eyes. Just like facing the radiant sun, even if you close your eyes and refuse to acknowledge its existence, you cannot help but feel its brilliance. The brilliance of the new China has alarmed those who are determined to keep China in darkness forever, and they have to step up their research on the new China. It is said that Dulles, who recently stepped down, personally presided over this research. Among these researchers, there are a group of language officers trained by the US government, who were originally prepared by the US government to go to various places to implement the occupation policy; there are also some so-called scholars, such as Wittfogel of Washington University and others, who are active supporters of the US reactionary diplomatic line. These people are studying the new China with the aim of opposing it, and they will only become more confused the more they study it. However, there are also some more clear-headed researchers of China who are trying to clarify the historical basis for the emergence of the new China and its undeniable real strength, in order to promote the US government to re-formulate its China policy. These people cannot but be noticed and attacked by McCarthy and others, some of whom were beaten, and some had to give up their research on the new China and instead study ancient China.

　　This is the unsolvable contradiction of the American ruling group: they do not recognize the new China, but they cannot help but study the new China, but the truth of the new China's prosperity and strength makes them distressed and anxious, and they dare not face it squarely. They would rather seek comfort from rumors and lies. Throwing dust at the sun, trying to block the sun's brilliance, the result is that the dust falls into their own eyes. It seems that madmen will not disappear quickly. From the Pope to the King of England, and then to the President of the United States, although hundreds of years have passed, a ridiculous farce of refusing to recognize the facts continues to be staged, the only difference is that the roles have changed.

　　Truth and new things that conform to the laws of history are irresistible. Those who do not recognize them will eventually have to admit their own stupidity and failure, which has been proven by history, whether you like it or not.

　　螳螂的悲剧
　　林默涵
    再过几个月，中华人民共和国就将满十周岁了。十年，这从整个人类的历史说来，几乎是不值得提起的短暂的一瞬。但是，掌握了自己的命运的中国人民，却在这短短的十年中，完成了过去几百年也不能完成的辉煌的业迹。我们的兄弟和朋友们为我们的成就而衷心喜悦；可是也有一小撮敌视我们的家伙，他们看到我们成就越大就越不舒服。
    有什么办法呢？现实生活的发展总是违背他们的邪恶的愿望。看看他们对中华人民共和国所采取的态度，是很有趣的。他们原先花了几十亿美元来支持一个中国人民所深恶痛绝的腐烂集团，满以为这样就可以把中国革命扑灭了。可是，结果却出乎他们的意料，中国人民胜利了，新中国就像早晨的太阳一样在东方的地平线上升起来了。他们最初是一阵惊慌，接着是互相埋怨，后来就采取了他们对待革命的国家一向惯用的办法，叫做“不承认”。当然，他们的企图扼杀中华人民共和国的罪恶活动，是一直在明明暗暗地进行着的。
    “不承认”，这是一切顽固的旧势力对待真理和新事物的最愚蠢的办法。他们以为只要他们不承认，事实也就不存在了。但是，倒霉的不是别人，正是那些不承认事实的人们，他们终究要被事实碰破脑袋，而真理和新事物却会排除一切障碍继续前进。
    大家知道，梵蒂冈教廷曾经不承认地球是绕着太阳转的，他们把这个真理当作异端邪说，甚至把宣传这种真理的人用烈火活活烧死。可是有什么用呢？地球仍然是在绕着太阳转。大家也知道，英国皇帝乔治三世曾经不承认一个新出现的国家——美利坚合众国。在他的心目中，世界上根本没有美国，有的只是他在美洲的一块殖民地。可是，这又有什么用呢？不管乔治三世承认不承认，美国毕竟是一个客观的存在。
    听说，就是猴子看到前面的猴子掉进了泥坑，也知道避免重蹈复辙的。美国政治领袖们的脑筋似乎还不及猴子。他们不但没有从乔治三世的愚蠢行为接受有益的教训，却继承了乔治三世的衣钵，学了乔治三世对付美国的办法来对付别的新生的国家。他们曾经不承认伟大的苏维埃联邦，但是苏联却不仅存在着，而且成了世界上最强盛的国家。他们又死不承认伟大的中华人民共和国，并且处心积虑要搞垮这个国家。可是结果如何呢？中华人民共和国不但屹然不动，而且越来越强大了。
    这就使美国老爷们陷进了非常可笑的尴尬境地。他们不承认新中国，可又偏要向它挑衅，同它交锋，结果是被自己所不承认的对象打得头破血流，而且还不得不同自己所不承认的对象一次又一次地举行谈判。西班牙的“愁容骑士”把风车看成巨人，闹出了同风车搏斗的笑话，终于吃一顿苦头；华尔街的疯子们却不承认真正的巨人——不可阻挡的革命势力，他们像螳螂一样伸着两臂梦想阻拦历史车轮的前进，其结果除了成为笑柄之外还能有什么呢？西班牙“愁容骑士”和华尔街疯子们的动机和目的是截然不同的，但毛病却是一样，由于神经失了常。
    看来就是美国统治集团里面，也有一些人感到这种政策的愚蠢可笑了。不久前，美国参议院外委会主席富布赖特就抱怨地说：“我们的外交政策是不充分的、过时的和方向错误的。这种政策的基础的一部分是对我们所生活的这个世界的情况的错误估计。更糟的是，它反映了一种危险的冷漠情绪和不愿意正视事实的很难理解的情绪。”（2月13日“美国新闻与世界报道”）
    尽管他们“不愿意正视事实，”而事实却逼得他们不能不睁开眼睛。正像对着光芒万丈的太阳，尽管你闭着眼睛不承认它的存在，你还是不能不感觉到它的光辉。新中国的光芒，使那些一心要把中国永远沉到黑暗中去的人们着了慌，他们也不得不来加紧研究新中国了。据说前不久下台的杜勒斯就曾亲自主持这个研究。这些研究者里面，有一批是美国政府训练出来的语文军官，他们原是美国政府准备派到各地去执行占领政策的；还有一些所谓学者，比如华盛顿大学的维特福格耳之流，他们是美国反动的外交路线的积极支持者，这些人是抱着反对新中国的目的而研究新中国的，他们只会越研究越糊涂。但是，也有一些头脑比较清醒的对中国的研究者，他们试图阐明产生新中国的历史根据和它的不可抹煞的现实力量，以便促使美国政府重新制订对华政策。这些人就不能不遭到麦卡锡之流的注意和攻击了，其中有的还挨了打，有的只好放弃对新中国的研究，而改为研究古代中国。
    这就是美国统治集团的无法解救的矛盾：他们不承认新中国，可又不能不研究新中国，但是新中国的繁荣昌盛的真相又使他们苦恼烦躁，不敢正视，他们宁愿从谣言和谎话中去寻找安慰。把尘土扔向太阳，妄想遮住太阳的光辉，结果是尘土掉进了他们自己的眼睛。看起来疯子还不会很快绝迹。由罗马教皇到英国国王，再到美国总统，时间虽然过了几百年，一出愚不可及的不承认事实的滑稽戏却还在继续演出，所不同的只是换了角色。
    真理和符合历史规律的新事物，是无法抗拒的。不承认它们的人，最后只好承认自己的愚蠢和失败，这已经由历史所证明，不管你愿意不愿意。
