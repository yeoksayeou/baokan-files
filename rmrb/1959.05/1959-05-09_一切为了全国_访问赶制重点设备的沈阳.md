　　Everything for the Whole Country
　　——Visiting Shenyang, Rushing to Produce Key Equipment
    By Our Correspondents Zhao Chunlie, Jin Yuanqing, Hu Bing
    Large Base, Heavy Task
    If this is your first visit to Shenyang, even before the train enters the city, you will see numerous chimneys and sprawling factories from the window, immediately giving you the feeling of arriving in a large industrial city. After visiting this city, you will feel proud and delighted: Shenyang has become a strong center of our great motherland's machinery manufacturing industry.
    Shenyang has thousands of factories, large and small. Their core is the machinery manufacturing plants that produce various kinds of equipment. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant is one of the few large plants in our country that manufactures heavy equipment. Large equipment, large castings, and forgings that many cities cannot produce are transported to this factory for processing and manufacturing. There are also China's largest transformer factory, cable factory, and high-voltage switch factory. The tens of thousands of kilovolt-amperes large transformers and hundreds of thousands of volts of ultra-high-voltage cables and high-voltage switches needed for the construction of large power stations are all manufactured here. They, together with the three major power equipment manufacturing plants in Harbin that produce generators, steam turbines, and boilers, form a strong pillar for the construction of China's power industry. There are also several machine tool factories specializing in the manufacture of various large precision boring machines, drilling machines, and lathes, forming a base for China's modern machine tool production.
    Shenyang has not disappointed the expectations of the people of the whole country. During the First Five-Year Plan period, it began to play a powerful base role, supporting the national industry with more than 385,000 sets of machinery and equipment, and more than 32,000 technicians, engineers, and factory directors. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, it manufactured tens of thousands of equipment for smelting, steel rolling, forging, machine tools, and large transformers for all parts of the country. It has made great contributions to the industrial leap forward with steel as the key link.
    This year, the state eagerly expects Shenyang to exert greater power in realizing the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, and requires it to complete the complete sets and important supporting tasks of six major equipment, including more than 80,000 sets of mining, coal washing and coking, irrigation and drainage, large rolling steel, power generation, and locomotive vehicles in the first half of the year.
    Thousands Singing, Ten Thousands Echoing
  　The most intense battle in Shenyang's industrial development history has begun. The Six Major Equipment Production Committee established by the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has become a powerful "headquarters" for commanding hundreds of thousands of production troops to carry out arduous struggles. This "headquarters" is headed by Jiao Ruoyu, the first secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. Secretaries, mayors, and ministers led thousands of large and small machinery factories throughout the city to organize six routes of troops to launch attacks on the six major equipment.
    The first urgent task was to "provide food and grass before the army arrives." In the face of a serious shortage of materials, the secretaries personally sat in the warehouse, held five material adjustment meetings, and adopted effective measures such as mobilizing employees to manufacture, substitute, and clear out inventory, and gave priority to allocating various "calibers" of materials to the most urgently needed units. Immediately afterwards, they arranged schedules, organized battles, organically united thousands of factories, and turned the entire city into a large cooperative factory.
    On the wall of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant Party Committee Secretary's office, we saw progress charts of rolling mill parts. This unit, which undertakes the task of manufacturing three sets of 650 rolling mill mainframes, has 50,000 to 60,000 parts to produce for the rolling mill alone. Excluding electrical parts, there are 20 factories providing supporting production for it. Taking the herringbone gear on the rolling equipment reducer as an example, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, which has the largest capacity for producing large castings and forgings in Shenyang, had to send this kind of blank to steel plants in distant places for tempering in the past, and then send it to Anshan to mill the gears. The round trip would take four months. However, this year, with the expansion of the Shenyang cooperation network, the city's production potential is like a spring gushing out endlessly. After Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant made the wooden mold sand box for the herringbone gear, it was sent to Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant for casting, then sent to Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant for tempering, and then sent to Shenyang Cement Machinery Plant for milling the gears. Finally, it was returned to Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant for assembly. The parts that originally took four months to complete can now be completed in one month.
    Some people describe Shenyang's cooperation as a large chorus, with one group of factories leading the singing and another group of factories accompanying the singing. In this large chorus, some nationally renowned large factories are also engaged in supporting production and making parts. The three modern machine tool manufacturing plants in Shenyang are also willing to engage in supporting production for irrigation and drainage equipment this time, producing diesel engines. When these supporting factories encounter difficulties, a large number of factories immediately cooperate with them.
    High Efficiency and High Speed
    The starting point of this battle was March 1st, when thousands of employees held a broadcasting competition meeting at the Municipal People's Cultural Palace, focusing on winning the six major equipment. This meeting was like a pebble thrown into the water, splashing everywhere, and dozens of industrial employees in the city were boiling.
    Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant is the largest heavy machinery manufacturing plant in the country that has already started production, and it is responsible for the main attack task of large rolling mills. When we arrived at this factory, the workers were carrying out the "Thousand-Hour Red Flag Competition," which means completing three days' worth of work in two days while ensuring quality.
    Walking into Workshop No. 1, a giant gantry planer blocked our view. Its gantry frame was as high as the city gate of Beijing. We measured its length and it was more than thirty steps long. This planer is the largest planer in Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, and also the largest gantry planer in existing production factories in the country. It is processing a 750 rolling mill frame, which weighs more than 30 tons and is surprisingly large. However, the workers told us that the four-roll cold rolling mill frame they processed was much larger than this. One frame weighs more than 100 tons, and in order to plane that big guy, they had to divide it into two halves. However, because large frames are not only heavy, but also require high precision, the original large tools seemed large and clumsy during processing! At that time, an old worker named Huang Huanxi, who had more than 20 years of experience, led four young workers to make a long, thin tool bar to plane the small square grooves on the frame. They increased the speed from 10 meters per minute to 20 meters per minute, and also doubled the depth of cut, completing the work in just two days. This high efficiency has already surprised us, but when we saw them processing the jaw crusher for mining that day, we only saw piles of iron filings sliding down the body. No! It would be more appropriate to call these iron blocks. We picked up a piece from the ground in surprise and looked at it carefully. It was more than half an inch thick. Wang Xishu, the section chief who manages this machine tool, told us that the operators of this machine tool boldly implemented various powerful cutting methods to improve efficiency, increased the depth of cut, and increased efficiency several times. More than one ton of iron filings are planed off every day.
    When we arrived at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, they had already completed the coal washing machine task 40 days ahead of schedule. Now they are working non-stop to complete the battle for three sets of 650 rolling mills. We had a pleasant conversation with some cadres of this factory about the manufacturing situation of 80 coal washing machines. According to normal production, this batch of coal washing machines would have to be completed by mid-June at the earliest, but the state required them to be completed by the end of April, and no later than the beginning of May, for the urgent need of coking coal in the steel industry. This was a serious test. Cadres, technicians, and workers closely combined, held meetings overnight, and discussed brilliant strategies. If there were not enough milling machines, they used lathes to do the work; if the riveting and welding operation area was not enough, they opened up open-air venues; if the main workshop lacked strength, the auxiliary workshops also participated in the main attack task. The entire factory set off a great coal washing machine craze, everyone offered brilliant ideas, everyone thought of ways, and launched a fierce attack on the key to coal washing machine production. Many technical innovation projects were proposed and immediately tested, and achieved results on the same day. More innovation projects were realized in one month than in the entire previous year, and production efficiency doubled. This battle was fought beautifully. Before the end of March, all 80 coal washing machine tasks were completed. People once again embodied the power of the mass movement from this amazing achievement.
    In the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, each workshop is equipped with "scouts" and "pilgrimage teams." Wherever there is experience, they go to learn. Workshop No. 3 took the lead and first created the highest record of completing 255% of the quota for daily output. Two days later, Workshop No. 2 quickly caught up, reaching 262% of the quota. Then Workshop No. 3 caught up with Workshop No. 2 again, and Workshop No. 2 caught up with Workshop No. 3 again. Workshop No. 4 was not to be outdone either. The workers put forward the battle slogan of "Surpassing No. 2 (workshop) and catching up with No. 3 (workshop)," and the production efficiency reached 500%, creating the highest record in the factory.
    There are countless similar examples.
    The City is Full of Gongs and Drums Announcing Good News
    In the past, it seemed that gongs and drums and firecrackers could only be heard during festivals, but today's Shenyang is full of this festive atmosphere every day. The workshops reported good news to the factory, and the factories reported good news to the Municipal Party Committee. The reporting teams followed one after another, reaching a climax on the eve of "May Day." Irrigation and drainage equipment completed 102,800 horsepower and more than 8,000 water pumps; coal washing equipment completed 1,291 units, rolling steel equipment completed two large rolling mills and one four-roll cold rolling mill, mining equipment completed 13,403 units, and power station equipment completed 2,500 units. This battle was not only fought quickly, but also well. All the equipment loaded for transportation was of the first class in terms of quality. All factories strictly controlled the quality checkpoints and did not let go of any defects.
    Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant made a set of large primary rolling mills for Tianjin and it was already packed and waiting to be shipped. Suddenly, someone felt that there seemed to be some quality problems with a component on the frame, so they disassembled the wooden box and re-examined it until every component was perfect.
    On this "May Day," the machinery workers walked at the forefront of the parade. They strode forward with majestic steps, holding high the production leap forward charts, passing through the rostrum and through the crowds cheering on both sides of the road.
    The people of the city rejoiced and were encouraged by the great victory of the mechanical industry workers. (Attached picture)

　　一切为了全国
　　——访问赶制重点设备的沈阳
    本报记者　赵春烈　金源清　胡丙
    基地大　任务重
    如果你是第一次访问沈阳，当火车还没有驶入市区的时候，远远地，林立的烟囱，绵延的厂房，从车窗映入你的眼帘，你会马上感觉到来到了一个工业大城。当你对这个城市访问了一番以后，你就会感觉自豪和欣喜：沈阳已经成为我们伟大祖国的机械制造业的一个强大的中心。
    沈阳，拥有大大小小几千个工厂。它们的核心，是生产各种不同设备的机械制造厂。沈阳重型机器厂，是目前我国制造重型设备的有数的大厂之一，许多城市不能做的大型设备，大型铸件和锻件，都要运到这个工厂加工制造。这里还有我国规模最大的变压器厂、电缆厂、高压开关厂，建设大型电站所需要的几万千伏安的大变压器，几十万伏超高压电缆、高压开关，都是由这里制造。它们和哈尔滨的发电机、汽轮机和锅炉等三大发电设备制造厂结合在一起，成为我国电力工业建设的坚强支柱。这里还有专门制造各种大型精密镗床、钻床、车床的好几个机床工厂，构成了我国现代化的机床生产的基地。
    沈阳，没有辜负全国人民的期望。在第一个五年计划期间，它就开始发挥了强大的基地作用，曾经以三十八万五千多台机器设备，和三万二千多名技术工人、工程师、厂长支援了全国工业。在大跃进的1958年，更为全国各地制造出数以万计的冶炼、轧钢、锻压、机床和大型变压器等设备。在以钢为纲的工业跃进中，立下了汗马功劳。
    今年国家热切期望沈阳市，为实现钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标发挥更大威力，要求它在上半年完成八万多台采矿、洗煤炼焦、排灌、大型轧钢、发电、机车车辆等六大设备的成套和重要配套任务。
    千人唱　万人和
  　沈阳工业发展史上最猛烈的一场战斗开始了。中共沈阳市委建立的六大设备生产委员会，成了指挥几十万生产大军进行艰苦奋战的一个强有力的“司令部”。这个“司令部”由市委第一书记焦若愚挂帅。书记、市长和部长们，分头率领全市上千座大小机械工厂，组织六路大军向六大设备展开进攻。
    第一件紧张的工作，便是做到“大军未到，粮草先行”。书记们在材料严重不足的形势下，亲自坐镇仓库，开了五次物资调剂会议，和发动职工群众制造、代用，和开仓清查等行之有效的措施，把各种不同“口径”的材料，尽先调给最急需的单位。紧接着，便是安排进度，组织战斗，把上千个工厂有机地联合起来，把整个城市变成了一个大协作的工厂。
    在沈阳矿山机器厂党委书记办公室的墙壁上，我们看到一张张轧钢机部件进展图表。这个承担三套650轧钢机主机制造任务的单位，它要生产的轧钢机光配件就有五、六万件，不算电器配件，就有二十个工厂为它搞配套生产。单拿轧钢设备减速机上的人字齿轮来说，沈阳市生产大铸件、大锻件能力最大的沈阳重型机器厂，以前生产这种毛坯，也得送到遥远的外地钢厂去闷火调质，然后还要送到鞍山去铣齿轮。来回总得四个月。可是，今年沈阳协作网一扩大，全城生产潜力宛如泉水一样滔滔不绝地喷发出来。沈阳矿山机器厂做出人字齿轮木模砂箱后，送到沈阳机车车辆厂去铸造，然后送沈阳重型机器厂闷火调质，接着再送到沈阳水泥机械厂去铣齿。最后再返回沈阳矿山机器厂装配成套。本来得用四个月完成的部件，现在，一个月就可以完成了。
    有人描述沈阳市的协作，就好像一场大合唱，一批工厂领唱，一批工厂在伴唱。在这种大合唱中，有些全国闻名的大工厂也在搞配套、做配件。沈阳三个现代化机床制造厂，这次也甘愿为排灌设备搞配套，生产柴油机。当这些搞配套的工厂遇有困难时，也立刻有大批工厂为它们打配合战。
    高效率高速度
    这次战斗的起点是3月1日，几千名职工在市人民文化宫举行了以夺取六大设备为中心的广播竞赛大会。这个大会，好似一块顽石投在水中，浪花四溅，全市几十多名工业职工沸腾起来了。
    沈阳重型机器厂是全国已经开工生产最大的重型机器制造厂，它担负了大型轧钢机的主攻任务。我们来到这个工厂的时候，职工们正在开展千台时红旗竞赛，这就是说，要在保证质量的前提下，两天完成三天的工时任务。
    走进一号车间，迎面一台巨型龙门刨床挡住了我们的视线，它的龙门架，有北京城门那样高，我们量了量它的长度，足有三十多步。这台刨床，是沈阳重型机器厂最大的一台刨床，也是全国现有生产工厂中最大的一台龙门刨床。它正在加工750轧钢机架体，这个机架有三十多吨重，大得惊人。但是，工人们却向我们说，他们加工的四辊冷轧机架体，比这个还要大得多。一个机架有一百多吨重，为了刨那个大家伙，不得不把它分成两半来干。但因大型机架不仅分量重，而且精度也要求较高，原有的大刀具在加工时竟也显得又大又笨哩！当时，由一个具有二十多年工龄的老工人黄焕喜带四个青年工人，动手做出了一个长长的细刀杆，来刨机架上的小方槽。他们加大速度，从每分钟十公尺增加到二十公尺，吃刀量也加大一倍，只用两天时间就干完了。这种高效率已经使我们吃了一惊，可是我们那天见到他们加工矿山用的颚式破碎机时，只见一堆堆的铁屑，顺着机身滑到地上。不！这不是铁屑，应该称作铁块似乎更恰当些。我们惊奇的从地上拾起一块，细细看了看，足有半寸多厚。管理这台机床的工段长王希树告诉我们说，这台机床操作工人，为了提高效率，大胆实行了各种强力切削方法，加大了吃刀量，效率提高好几倍，每天刨下的铁屑有一吨多重。
    我们来到沈阳矿山机器厂时，这里已经提前四十天完成了洗煤机任务，现在他们又马不停蹄地投入为完成三套650轧钢机的战斗中。我们和这个厂的一些干部愉快的谈起八十台洗煤机制造情况。按照正常生产进行，这批洗煤机最快也得6月中旬完成，而国家为了钢铁工业急需的焦炭，要求他们要在4月底完成，最迟不得超过5月上旬。这是一个严重的考验，干部、技术人员、工人紧密结合一起，连夜开会、商讨妙策。铣床不足，就用车床来干；铆焊作业面积不够，就开辟露天场所；主要车间力量缺乏，辅助车间也参加主攻任务。全厂掀起大战洗煤机热潮，人人献妙计，个个想办法，向洗煤机生产关键展开猛攻。很多技术革新项目提出后，立即试验，当天就收到了成效。一个月中实现的革新项目比去年全年还多，生产效能成倍增长。这一仗干得好漂亮，不到3月底，八十台洗煤机任务全部完成了，人们从这件惊人的成绩中，再一次体现了群众运动的威力。
    在沈阳水泵厂里，各个车间都设有“侦察员”、“取经队”，哪里有经验，就到哪里学习。三车间一马当先，日产量首先创造完成定额255％最高纪录。两日后，二车间马上赶了过去，达到定额的262％。接着三车间又赶过二车间，二车间再赶过三车间。四车间也不示弱，工人们提出“超二（车间）、赶三（车间）”的战斗口号，生产效率达到500％，创造全厂最高纪录。
    类似这样的例子是数不胜数的。
    满城锣鼓报佳音
    过去似乎只有节日才能听到锣鼓鞭炮声响，而今天的沈阳城，每天都充满着这种节日的气氛。车间向厂部报喜，工厂向市委报喜，报喜队伍，一队跟着一队，在“五一”前夕，达到了高潮。排灌设备完成十万二千八百马力和八千多台水泵；洗煤设备完成一千二百九十一台，轧钢设备完成大型轧钢两套、四辊冷轧机一台，矿山设备完成一万三千四百零三台，电站设备完成二千五百台。这一仗不仅打得快，而且好，所有装车外运的设备，论起质量，都是第一流的。各厂都严格的把住了质量关口，哪怕有半点毛病也不放过。
    沈阳重型机器厂为天津制作一套大型初轧机，已经装箱待运了。突然有个人感到机架上的一个部件似乎质量有些问题，于是他们又把木箱拆了，重新检查，直到每个部件都完美无缺，才算了事。
    在“五一”节这天，机械工人走在游行队伍的最前列。他们迈着雄壮的步伐，高举着生产跃进图表，经过主席台，穿过夹道欢呼的人群。
    全市人民为机械工业职工巨大胜利欢腾鼓舞。（附图片）
