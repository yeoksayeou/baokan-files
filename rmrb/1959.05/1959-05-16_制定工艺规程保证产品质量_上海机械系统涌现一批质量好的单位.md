Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 15th: Shanghai's machinery industry, in the manufacturing of the six major equipment sets, not only pays attention to completing the output plan on time but also focuses on product quality, resulting in a number of high-quality and high-yield factories and workshops. Many groups, production teams, and workers have not produced a single defective product for several months.

　　In early May, among the irrigation and drainage equipment completed by dozens of factories in Shanghai, capable of irrigating four to five million mu of farmland, the water pumps all underwent water pressure testing and pumping tests to prevent substandard products from leaving the factory. The mine hoists produced by various factories all underwent trial installation and trial operation before leaving the factory. The parts and components of rolling mills are produced collaboratively by dozens of factories. To ensure quality, these parts and components are first concentrated at the factory manufacturing the main engine for trial assembly before being shipped out of the province, and only delivered to the user units after the assembly is deemed suitable.

　　Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Machinery Industry System has again focused on the critical point of high quality and high yield, clearly stating that production must be increased under the premise of ensuring quality, and has established some necessary rules and regulations.

　　Many machinery factories in Shanghai undertaking the task of manufacturing the six major equipment sets have conducted ideological education among workers on the inseparability of high yield and high quality in the "High Quality and High Yield" red flag emulation campaign, and have mobilized workers to launch open discussions to establish the concept of ensuring quality for everyone. Factory leaders, administrative, and technical personnel go deep into the workshops, participate in labor, and improve management work. For example, the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory is scheduled to produce 1,900 diesel engines in the second quarter, which is the highest quarterly output target for the entire factory since the Great Leap Forward last year. Whether the castings in the blank workshop can achieve high quality and high yield is the key to the entire factory's production. In early April, this factory mobilized the masses to speak out freely, strengthened the concept of quality, and adopted a method combining workers, technicians, and administrative management cadres to supplement and formulate process regulations. As a result, the output and quality of castings increased rapidly, with crankshaft production increasing from 40 pieces per day in the past to 118 pieces, and the scrap rate dropping to 1.67%. The May 1st Motor Factory, which undertakes the task of manufacturing motor accessories for the six major equipment sets, regularly educates employees and inspectors on quality assurance, and establishes and improves the responsibility system, inspection system, and other management systems. New products that have been trial-produced are only put into production after being approved by higher authorities. In this way, the quality of all products in the factory has remained stable. From January to April this year, not only was the production task overfulfilled every month, but in the quality competition of small and medium-sized motors held by the First Ministry of Machine Building in mid-April, the quality was rated as the first in the Shanghai area. The electric furnace youth team of the casting workshop of the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory has not produced a single defective product since the beginning of this year, and the quality of the castings poured with their steel is also excellent, becoming a high-quality and high-yield red flag team in the entire factory.

### 制定工艺规程保证产品质量  上海机械系统涌现一批质量好的单位

    制定工艺规程保证产品质量
    上海机械系统涌现一批质量好的单位
    新华社上海15日电　上海市机械工业在制造六大设备中，不仅注意按时完成产量计划，同时注意抓产品质量，出现了不少优质高产的工厂和车间；有许多小组、生产班和工人，几个月没有出过一次废品。
    5月初，上海市几十家工厂完成的可以灌溉四、五百万亩农田的排灌设备中，水泵都经过水压检验和抽水试验，防止不符合规格的产品出厂。各厂生产的矿山用卷扬机，在出厂之前都经过了试安装、试运转。轧钢机的零件部件，是由几十家工厂协作生产的。为了保证质量，这些零件和部件在运往外地以前，也先集中到制造主机的工厂进行试装配，装配合用才交给使用单位。
    最近，上海市机械工业系统又抓住优质高产这一关，明确提出必须在保证质量的前提下提高产量，并建立了一些必要的规章制度。
    上海市许多担负六大设备制造任务的机械工厂，在“优质高产”红旗竞赛运动中，向职工进行了高产和优质不可偏废的思想教育，发动职工展开鸣放辩论，使人人树立保证质量的观念。工厂的领导、行政、技术人员深入车间，参加劳动，改进管理工作。如上海柴油机厂第二季度要生产一千九百台柴油机，这是全厂从去年大跃进以来的最高季度产量指标。毛坯车间的铸件能否达到优质高产，是全厂生产的关键。4月初，这个厂发动群众大鸣大放，加强了质量观念，又采用工人、技术人员和行政管理干部三结合的办法，补充制定了工艺规程，结果，铸件产量质量都迅速提高，曲轴从过去日产四十根提高到一百一十八根，废品率下降到1.67％。担负六大设备电机配套制造任务的五一电机厂，经常对职工和检验人员进行保证质量的教育，建立和健全责任制度、检验制度和其他管理制度；试制成功的新产品，一定等待上级鉴定同意以后才投入生产。这样，全厂产品质量始终保持稳定，今年1月到4月，不但月月超额完成了生产任务；4月中旬在第一机械工业部召开的中小型电机质量评比会上，质量被评为上海地区第一名。上海矿山机器厂铸造车间电炉青年班今年以来从未出过一次废品，用他们的钢水浇铸出来的铸件，质量也是优良的，成为全厂的优质高产红旗班。
