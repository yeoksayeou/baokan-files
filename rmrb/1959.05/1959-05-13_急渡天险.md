    Braving Perilous Rapids
    "Comrade Duo Fu, the Party trusts you. This package of important documents must be delivered by the evening of the 6th."
    "No problem." Ding Duo Fu returned from the captain after receiving the task. The next day was May 6th. Before dawn, he shouldered the thirty-odd-jin package of documents the captain had given him, fully armed, and set off.
    In May, the Xiangxi area of Hunan is in the rainy season. It had already rained continuously for two days on May 4th and 5th, and it was pouring rain on the day Comrade Ding Duo Fu departed.
    Streams and gullies separated the passages; collapsed mountain soil blocked the way; the already difficult mountain roads were now even more muddy and impassable. Ding Duo Fu crossed more than a dozen small streams and climbed more than a dozen steep ridges. He was soaked to the bone, but the documents wrapped in oilcloth were dry. When he reached Longbi Mouth, where Guzhang County and Jishou County meet, he felt that the real difficulty had appeared. A river more than ten zhang wide flowed horizontally in front of him. The wooden bridge had been washed away by the river, leaving only two thumb-thick iron ropes, trembling and hanging high above the river. The river was rushing and the waves were surging. The masses, blocked by the river, gathered on the riverbank, discussing the situation. Comrade Ding Duo Fu went to the riverbank to take a look. What to do? Wade across the river? That wouldn't work. He thought: If I am washed away, that's a small matter, but if the documents are lost, it will cause significant losses to the revolution. He wanted to climb across the iron ropes, but the masses stopped him, saying it was too dangerous and he should wait for the water to recede before crossing. But how long would that take? The task was so urgent, he couldn't delay. This Tujia young man had never bowed his head in the face of difficulties. At this moment, the image of the Long March heroes who flew across the Luding Bridge and the sense of honor of the people's police flashed in his mind. He firmly gripped the iron ropes with both hands and moved his feet forward. The river was so wide, the water so deep, and he was carrying a package of documents weighing more than thirty jin and a full set of weapons and ammunition. If he relaxed even slightly, everything would be over. The masses stared at him nervously, holding their breath, afraid that something unexpected would happen. The flood rolled below, the gale howled in his ears, and the rain poured down on him, but the brave and careful Comrade Duo Fu resolutely climbed steadily along the iron ropes. When he had gone more than a zhang, the iron rope suddenly sagged, swaying and creaking in the air. Looking down, Comrade Ding Duo Fu suddenly felt dizzy and the world spinning. At this critical moment, he seemed to hear the voice again: "The Party trusts you, you must complete the task no matter how great the difficulties." He immediately calmed down and continued forward. He finally reached the other side and completed the urgent task entrusted to him by the Party.

    急渡天险
    “多福同志，党信任你。这包重要文件一定要在6日晚上送到。”
    “没有问题。”丁多福由队长那里接受任务回来。第二天就是5月6日，天还不亮，他就背上队长交给他的三十多斤重的文件包，全副武装出发了。
    5月，在湖南湘西一带，是多雨的季节。5月4、5两日，已经下了两天连阴雨，丁多福同志出发这一天，还正下着倾盆大雨。
    一条条溪沟，隔开了通道；崩塌下来的山土，压断了去路；本来就难走的山路，现在更加泥泞难行了。丁多福越过十几条小溪，爬过了十多座峻岭，他浑身上下全湿透了，只有油纸包着的文件是干的。当他走到古丈县和吉首县交界的龙鼻嘴的时候，他感到真正的困难出现了。十多丈宽的河水横流在前面，木桥被河水冲坏了，只剩下两根大姆指粗的铁绳，颤巍巍地高悬在河面上。河水湍急，浪涛汹涌。被河水拦阻的群众，集聚在河边，议论纷纷。丁多福同志走到河边一看，怎么办，淌河过去吗？不行。他想：人冲走了倒是小事，文件丢失了就会给革命带来重大的损失。他要攀着铁绳过去，群众阻拦说，这样太危险，等水落了再走。但是，要等到什么时候呢？任务这样紧急，不能耽搁时间。这个土家族的小伙子，从来没有在困难面前低过头。这时，飞渡沪定桥的长征英雄的形象和人民警察的荣誉感，在他心里闪亮起来。他坚定地两手攀住铁绳，双脚就向前移动。河这样宽，水这样深，身背着三十多斤重的文件包和全套武器弹药，只要稍一松劲，就会什么都完的。群众十分紧张地盯着他，为他紧捏着一把冷汗，生怕他发生意外。洪水在下面翻滚，狂风在耳边呼啸，雨水在他身上浇淋，胆大心细的多福同志毅然沿着铁绳稳步攀行。当他走出一丈多远的时候，铁绳猛然下垂，在空中，飘摇晃荡，发出吱吱的惊人的响声。一低头，丁多福同志突然感到头昏眼花，天旋地转。在这千钧一发的时刻，耳边似乎又响起了“党信任你，无论多大的困难也要完成任务”的声音。他立即镇静下来，继续前进。他终于到达了彼岸，完成了党所交给他的紧急任务。
