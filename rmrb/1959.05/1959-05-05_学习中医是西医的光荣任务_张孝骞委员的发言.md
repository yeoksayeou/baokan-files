Learning Traditional Chinese Medicine is a Glorious Task for Western Medicine
Speech by Committee Member Zhang Xiaoqian

    I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of other leading comrades, as well as Vice-Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee. I fully agree with the solemn statements made by the delegates and committee members regarding the Tibet issue, and their severe condemnation and warning against the interference conspiracies of imperialism and foreign reactionaries. Now, I would like to say a few words about learning traditional Chinese medicine.

    Traditional Chinese medicine has accumulated the valuable experience of the working people in their struggle against diseases over thousands of years. It is a part of our country's rich cultural heritage and a great treasure house. The Party has always attached great importance to this national medical heritage and put forward the policy of uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine very early on. However, in the past, bourgeois intellectuals, influenced by slavish education, blindly worshipped foreign countries and looked down on and rejected traditional Chinese medicine. The great rectification movement deeply criticized national nihilism and the sectarian ideas of many Western medicine practitioners, raising the ideological awareness of the vast number of medical and health workers. As a result, the policy on traditional Chinese medicine was further implemented, leading to a great leap forward in traditional Chinese medicine work in 1958. Now, a nationwide upsurge in Western medicine practitioners learning traditional Chinese medicine has emerged, creating an unprecedented great unity between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. After the Party proposed breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and launching a vigorous technical revolution, traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine shone brilliantly, and many experiences and theories of traditional Chinese medicine have been creatively applied and developed. The large number of facts demonstrating the outstanding curative effects of traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine has powerfully educated bourgeois intellectuals and pointed out the correct direction for future medical scientific research. This is a major event in China's medical and health circles.

    Because I was influenced by imperialist slavish education, I also had the wrong idea of looking down on traditional Chinese medicine and thinking that it was unscientific. After liberation, I received the Party's education, and my understanding of the policy on traditional Chinese medicine gradually deepened, and my ideological understanding has improved to a certain extent. Encouraged by the brilliant achievements of traditional Chinese medicine work across the country and with the encouragement and support of the leadership, I finally entered the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine's research class last autumn. Although the learning progress is still shallow, the ideological enlightenment I have gained is quite profound.

    Learning traditional Chinese medicine has made me further realize that traditional Chinese medicine has a broad and long-term practical foundation and a simple dialectical materialist viewpoint, and has made extremely brilliant achievements over thousands of years. The Nei Jing, a work from more than two thousand years ago, describes the physiology of digestion, respiration, and circulation in a way that is roughly the same as modern physiology. In particular, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, which explains the opposition and unity of things and the correlation between internal functional activities and the external environment, has many similarities with the most advanced medical ideas of modern times. In terms of inventions, the method of nasal inoculation for smallpox was popular in Chinese folk medicine as early as the sixteenth century. This method not only controlled the disease of smallpox but also opened up a broad path for modern clinical immunology. After it was introduced to the West, the British invented the cowpox vaccination method eighty years later based on it. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, traditional Chinese medicine has continuously enriched world medicine, and there are many such examples. At present, there are still some major problems in medicine, especially many chronic diseases that lack effective prevention and treatment methods. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, we now have much more favorable conditions than ever before to explore and summarize more of the essence from the great treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine to solve the unresolved problems of modern medicine. This can serve the health needs of more than 600 million people and, at the same time, make greater contributions to world medicine. From this point of view, we can more deeply understand the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine.

    Now, a vigorous mass movement to learn traditional Chinese medicine has been launched across the country. The opportunity for off-the-job learning is very valuable, but the number of people obviously cannot be too large. Therefore, the vast number of medical workers still rely on learning traditional Chinese medicine while on the job. Regarding on-the-job learning, I think the learning methods can be diverse. In addition to systematic theoretical learning, there should also be sufficient practical work, which requires close cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine to achieve. Taking the treatment of appendicitis with traditional Chinese medicine as an example, because many hospitals have carried out such cooperation, we Western medicine practitioners have already mastered this treatment, and traditional Chinese and Western medicine are further studying its mechanism of action. If we use the same spirit to learn and study the treatment of each disease with traditional Chinese medicine, the overall achievement will inevitably be huge. As long as we truly understand the Party's instructions on unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, seize every opportunity to humbly learn from traditional Chinese medicine, and learn and apply at the same time, we will inevitably be able to achieve universal mastery, focus on improvement, and finally achieve the lofty goal of inheriting and carrying forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine in the near future.

    Western medicine practitioners learning traditional Chinese medicine can greatly improve the professional level of Western medicine. This is not only because learning traditional Chinese medicine allows one to walk on two legs, but also because mastering traditional Chinese medicine can make up for the shortcomings of Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has very detailed and accurate clinical observations, especially the principles of four diagnoses and eight principles, syndrome differentiation and treatment, and flexible and rigorous treatment methods, which can all be used as references for engaging in Western medicine. After Western medicine learns these principles, it will be able to better use its original Western medicine knowledge. Taking the study of prescriptions as an example, there is great logic in the compatibility of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. For example, Coptis chinensis is a very good antibiotic, but it is prone to drug resistance. Traditional Chinese medicine has already solved this problem, because in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, Coptis chinensis is generally used in combination with other drugs of the same taste, such as Phellodendron amurense and Scutellaria baicalensis. Recent experiments have shown that such compound usage can reduce the production of drug resistance. This principle also applies to the treatment of many other drugs, and anti-tuberculosis drugs are a significant example. If we had been able to carefully learn from traditional Chinese medicine in the past, this clinically significant rule should have been mastered by Western medicine practitioners long ago.

    Learning traditional Chinese medicine is a glorious task for Western medicine practitioners at present, and more Western medicine practitioners will surely respond to the Party's call and actively devote themselves to this study, preparing to make contributions to the implementation of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine.

### 学习中医是西医的光荣任务  张孝骞委员的发言

    学习中医是西医的光荣任务
    张孝骞委员的发言
    我衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他各位首长的报告，以及李维汉副主席关于政协常务委员会的工作报告。我完全同意各位代表、委员的关于西藏问题的严正发言和对帝国主义、外国反动派的干涉阴谋的严厉谴责与警告。我现在想对学习祖国医学说几句话。
    祖国医学积累了劳动人民几千年来同疾病作斗争的宝贵经验，是我国丰富文化遗产的一部分，是一个伟大的宝库。党对这份民族医药遗产从来就十分重视，很早就提出了团结中西医的政策。但是，过去资产阶级知识分子受了奴化教育的影响，盲目崇拜外国，轻视和排斥中医。伟大的整风运动，深入批判了民族虚无主义思想和许多西医的宗派思想，提高了广大医务卫生工作者的思想觉悟，中医政策因而得到了进一步的贯彻，出现了一九五八年中医工作大跃进的局面。现在，全国掀起了一个西医学习中医热潮，出现了中西医之间的空前大团结。在党提出破除迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革命以后，中医中药大放异彩，许多中医经验和理论得到了创造性的运用和发挥。中医中药获得突出疗效的大量事实，有力地教育了资产阶级知识分子，为今后医学科学研究指出了正确的方向，这是我国医药卫生界的一件大事。
    我因为受了帝国主义奴化教育的影响，也曾经有过看不起中医、认为中医不科学的错误思想。解放后，受了党的教育，中医政策的学习逐步深入，思想认识有一定的提高。在全国中医工作的辉煌成就的鼓舞下，在领导的鼓励与支持下，我终于去年秋天进了北京中医学院研究班。虽然学习进度还很浅，得到的思想启发却是比较深刻的。
    学习中医使我进一步体会到祖国医学具有广大长远的实践基础和朴素的辩证唯物主义观点，几千年来有着极为光辉的成就。两千多年前的内经著作，所叙述关于消化、呼吸、循环的生理，已经同现代生理学大致不差，特别是说明事物对立与统一、内在机能活动和外在环境相关的阴阳五行学说，同现代最先进医学思想有许多相同之处。在创造发明方面，如鼻苗种痘法，十六世纪即已通行于我国民间。这个方法不仅控制了天花这一个病，而且为现代临床免疫学开辟了广阔的道路，传入西方以后，在它的基础上，八十年后英国人才发明牛痘苗接种法。自汉唐以来，祖国医学不断丰富了世界医学，这样的例子是不少的。目前，医学上还存在若干重大问题，特别是许多慢性病还缺乏有效的防治方法。在党的中医政策的光辉照耀下，我们现在有着比以往任何时期优越得多的条件，可以从祖国医学的伟大宝库里面发掘和总结出更多的精华，用来解决现代医学悬而未决的问题。这一方面可为六亿多人民的保健需要服务，同时可为世界医学作出更多更大的贡献。从这个观点出发，我们就能够更深切地认识党的中医政策了。
    现在全国已经掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的学习中医的群众运动。离职学习的机会是非常可贵的，但人数显然不能太多，因此，广大的医务工作者仍然靠在职学习中医。关于在职学习，我认为学习的方法可以多种多样，除了系统的理论学习外，还应当配以足够的工作实践，这就需要中西医的密切合作来实现。以阑尾炎的中医治疗为例，由于许多医院进行了这样的合作，我们西医已经掌握了这个治疗，现中西医正在进一步地研究它的作用机制。如果用同一精神进行每一个疾病的中医治疗的学习和研究，总的成绩必然是巨大的。只要我们切实体会党的中西医团结合作的指示，抓住一切机会虚心向中医学习，并且边学习、边应用，必然能够在不久的将来做到普遍掌握，重点提高，最后达成继承、发扬祖国医学遗产的崇高目的。
    西医学习中医，而且可以大大提高西医的业务水平，这不只是因为学会中医以后有了两条腿走路，同样重要的是，通过掌握中医可以补西医之短。祖国医学有很细致准确的临证观察，特别是四诊八纲、辩证论治等法则，以及灵活而又严谨的治疗方法，这都可以作为从事西医业务的参考。西医学会了这些原则以后，会能够更好地运用原有的西医知识。以方剂学为例，中医的方剂配伍有很大的道理。如黄连是一味很好的抗生药物，但容易发生抗药性。这个问题中医早已得到了解决，因为中医处方，黄连一般和其他同性味的药物如黄柏、黄岑等合用。最近的实验证明，这样的复合用法可以减少抗药性的产生。这一原则同样适用于许多其他药物治疗，抗结核药物就是一个显著的例子。若是我们过去能够精心从祖国医学学习，这个富有临床意义的规律应当很早就被西医们掌握了。
    学习中医，是目前西医的一个光荣任务，一定会有更多的西医响应党的号召积极投入这个学习，准备为贯彻党的中医政策而作出贡献。
