    Vegetables in Tibet
    Geng Yu Fang

    During my process of learning the Tibetan language, I was particularly struck by the fact that the names of vegetables were almost all borrowed from Chinese. For example, cabbage, cucumber, eggplant, scallion, leek, radish, and so on.

    Although the exact date when Han Chinese vegetable growing techniques were introduced to Tibet is not documented, according to Tibetan comrades, as early as the seventh century, when King Songtsen Gampo sent young people to the mainland to study agricultural technology, they brought back various vegetable seeds and were the first to grow radishes on the plateau.

    Because of the large difference between day and night temperatures on the plateau, some vegetables are not easy to cultivate. Before the liberation of Tibet, except for Lhasa and some warmer areas where some cabbage and radishes were grown, other areas, such as the high and cold areas of Ali and northern Tibet, had very few vegetables.

    Vegetables are very important in people's lives and cannot be replaced by meat, fish, chicken, duck, or delicacies. After the People's Liberation Army and central government personnel entered Tibet, they made vegetable growing an important and regular production task in their spare time. Whether in the windy, dry, and cold Nagqu (Black River), or in Ali, the "roof of the world's roof," whether in remote villages or in factories, offices, and towns along transportation routes, they reclaimed wasteland, sowed seeds, and grew fresh and delicious vegetables to ensure their own non-staple food supply and to supply our Tibetan brothers. They also taught vegetable growing techniques to the masses, sparking the interest of Tibetans in growing vegetables. Now, more and more Tibetans in various regions are growing vegetables, the variety of vegetables is becoming more diverse, and the methods of cooking are gradually becoming more refined.

    In Lhasa, Xigaze (Shigatse), and other places, large-scale planting experiment farms have also been established. The headed cabbage grown there weighs more than fifty jin per head, and there are also red radishes weighing nearly forty jin each. In addition, leeks, scallions, and spinach also grow very well.

    西藏的蔬菜
    耿予方
    我在学习藏语的过程中，有一个特别突出的印象，就是蔬菜的名字，几乎全是从汉语中借去的。例如白菜、黄瓜、茄子、葱、韭菜、萝卜等等。
    汉族的种菜技术传到西藏的确切年代虽然没有文献可查。据藏族同志谈：早在七世纪藏王松赞干布派青年来内地学习农业技术时，就带去了各种菜种，并且首先在高原上长起萝卜来。
    由于高原的昼夜气温相差很大，所以有些蔬菜不容易栽培。在西藏解放以前，除了拉萨和一些比较暖和的地区，种些白菜、萝卜之外，其他大部分地区如阿里和藏北等高寒地带，就很少有蔬菜。
    蔬菜在人的生活中是非常重要的，并非肉鱼鸡鸭山珍海味所可代替。人民解放军和中央工作人员进藏以后，在工作之余，就把种菜作为一项重要的经常的生产任务。不管在风大干燥寒冷的黑河，还是在世界屋脊的屋脊——阿里；无论是在偏僻的乡村，还是在工厂、机关和交通要冲的城镇，都开垦了荒地，播下了种子，长出了鲜美可口的青菜，保证自己的副食品，也供应藏族的兄弟。并且把种菜技术传授给广大群众，引起了藏胞们种菜的兴趣。现在，各个地区种菜的藏胞日益加多，菜的花样更加翻新，做菜的方法也逐渐精致。
    在拉萨、日喀则等地，还设立了规模较大的种植试验场。种出来的莲花白菜一棵有五十多斤，还有近四十斤一个的红萝卜。此外韭菜、葱、菠菜，也生长得很好。
