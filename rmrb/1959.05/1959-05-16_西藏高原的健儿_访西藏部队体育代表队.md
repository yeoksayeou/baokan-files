The Athletes of the Tibetan Plateau
—A Visit to the Sports Delegation of the Tibet Military Region

At the Second Sports Games of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the sports delegation of the Tibet Military Region received special love and respect. On the eve of the games, General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and General Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of General Staff, cordially met with them. Athletes from various fraternal military delegations presented them with numerous gifts and letters of appreciation. On the opening ceremony day, when they appeared before the audience in blue uniforms, holding the team flag high, and marching in neat steps, the people of the capital greeted the representatives of the heroic troops with thunderous applause and cheers, expressing warm welcome and the greatest respect.

The sports delegation of the Tibet Military Region consists of 154 people from Han, Tibetan, Hui, and other ethnic groups. Among them are 43 Tibetan young men and women. At this sports games, they not only participated in ball games but also in 14 events such as weightlifting, track and field, and gymnastics, winning the all-army championships in the men's horizontal bar, men's vaulting horse, and light heavyweight weightlifting, as well as second place in the men's gymnastics team total score, third place in the men's 110-meter hurdles, and second place in the rings, among many other excellent achievements.

This is the result of the People's Liberation Army's Tibet troops' long-term adherence to carrying out mass sports activities under the harsh climate of the plateau. To adapt to the plateau environment, wherever the Tibet garrison is stationed, no matter how harsh the climate or how dangerous the terrain, they will open up sports fields and engage in sports activities. They often practice climbing snow-capped mountains, armed rapid marching, climbing suspension bridges, rafting, overcoming obstacles, and close combat. Li Yuhuai, the vice-captain of the handball team, told the reporter a story: In 1953, their unit was responsible for the task of building the Kangzang Highway. During the project to conquer the famous dangerous U-Ran Gulch, the troops still insisted on physical exercise as usual. The altitude there was more than 4,000 meters, and both sides were cliffs. The basketball court was set up on top of this cliff, surrounded by tree branches to prevent the basketball from rolling down into the ditch. The troops went up to play ball, climbing up while holding the ropes used for cliff operations, and having a great time playing a game.

Many Tibetan male and female athletes told reporters that the People's Liberation Army not only helped the Tibetan people liberate but also brought new cultural and sports life to the Tibetan people. Before liberation, the vast Tibetan people struggled on the line of starvation, without any cultural or sports life, let alone famous athletes. This time, more than 40 young Tibetan male and female athletes were able to travel long distances to Beijing to participate in the all-army sports games, which was a first in Tibetan history. The Tibetan athletes told reporters that they were all trained by the People's Liberation Army. To promote sports exercise among Tibetan compatriots, the Tibet garrison holds sports games every year, organizes Tibetans to visit, often plays ball games with school students, and helps Tibetan youths with training or organizes Tibetan male and female teams to visit the mainland. The women's basketball team that came to Beijing this time was composed of nine Tibetan girls and two Hui girls. Previously, some of these girls were herders on the grasslands, some were poor people in Lhasa, some were serfs in mountain villages, and some were servants in aristocratic families. These people, who had never seen a basketball before, have become a women's basketball team that plays bravely and has relatively skilled techniques after several months of hard training under the guidance of sports instructor Liu Laimin.

The sports delegation of the Tibet Military Region received enthusiastic care and assistance from the people of the capital and various fraternal military units when they came to Beijing to participate in the competition. Many delegations selected the best coaches and outstanding athletes to help the athletes of this fraternal ethnic group and fraternal unit improve their skills. Zhang Kuizheng, an outstanding athlete from the Fuzhou Military Region delegation, helped Tibetan soldier Banba practice throwing the javelin, quickly improving from 38 meters to 42 meters. The Fuzhou Military Region delegation also took the initiative to send female athlete Huang Yuehua to help Tibetan female athlete Zhuoga Qunzong practice throwing grenades. (Attached picture)

    西藏高原的健儿
    ——访西藏部队体育代表队
    新华社记者　姜文品
    在中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会上，西藏部队体育代表队，特别受到人们的热爱和尊敬。大会前夕，中国人民解放军总政治部主任谭政大将和副总参谋长张爱萍上将亲切地接见了他们。各兄弟部队代表队的运动员送给他们大批礼品和慰问信。开幕式那天，他们穿着蓝色的服装、高举着队旗、迈着整齐的步伐一出现在观众眼前，首都人民以暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声，向英雄部队的代表表示热烈的欢迎和最大的敬意。
    西藏部队体育代表队由汉、藏、回等民族一百五十四人组成。其中有藏族男、女青年四十三人。这次运动会上，他们不仅参加了球类比赛，而且还参加了举重、田径、体操等十四个项目的比赛，获得了男子单杠、男子纵跳马和轻重量级举重三个项目的全军冠军和男子体操团体总分第二名，男子一百一十公尺高栏第三名、吊环第二名等许多优异成绩。
    这是人民解放军西藏部队在高原恶劣气候下长期坚持开展群众性体育活动的结果。为适应高原的环境，西藏驻军每到一地不管气候怎样恶劣、地势如何险要，也要开辟运动场，搞起体育活动。他们经常练习爬雪山、武装快速行军、攀行溜索桥、垒木泅渡、超越障碍和短兵搏斗。手球队副队长李玉怀向记者讲述了这样一个故事：1953年，他们部队担负修建康藏公路的任务。在征服有名的天险乌然沟的工程中，部队还照常坚持体育锻炼。那里拔海四千多公尺，两旁都是绝壁，篮球场就设在这绝壁的顶上，周围用树条围起防备篮球滚下陷沟。部队上去打球，都是握着悬崖作业的绳索攀登上去，痛快地干上一场。
    许多藏族男、女运动员告诉记者，人民解放军不仅帮助西藏人民解放，而且还给西藏人民带去了新的文化体育生活。解放前，广大西藏人民在饥饿线上挣扎，没有什么文化体育生活，更没有什么体育运动的著名选手。这次四十多个男、女藏族青年运动员能远途跋涉来北京参加全军运动会，这在西藏历史上还是第一次。藏族运动员告诉记者，他们都是解放军培养出来的。西藏驻军为推动藏族同胞的体育锻炼，每年都要召开体育运动大会，组织藏胞参观；经常和学校的学生打球比赛，并且帮助藏族青年进行训练或组织藏族男、女球队到内地参观。这次来北京的女子篮球队，就是由九个藏族姑娘和两个回族姑娘组成的。以前这些姑娘有的是草原上的牧女、有的是拉萨市的贫民、有的是山村的农奴、有的是贵族家的佣人。这些自小未见过篮球的人，在体育指导刘来民的指导下，经过几个月的刻苦锻炼，已成了一支打得勇猛、技术比较熟练的女篮球队了。
    西藏部队体育代表队这次来北京参加比赛，也得到首都人民和各兄弟部队的热情关怀和多方面的帮助。许多代表都挑出了最好的教练员和优秀的运动员去帮助这个兄弟民族和兄弟部队的选手提高技术。福州部队代表队的优秀运动员张奎政帮助藏族战士班巴练习扔标枪，很快由三十八公尺提高到四十二公尺。福州部队代表队还主动派出女运动员黄月华帮助藏族女队员卓嘎群宗练习投手榴弹。（附图片）
