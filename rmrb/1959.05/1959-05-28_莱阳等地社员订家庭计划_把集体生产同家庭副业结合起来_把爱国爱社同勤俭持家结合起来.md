    People's communes in Laiyang, Tancheng, Chiping and other counties in Shandong Province, on the basis of the commune and team's annual production plans, are helping commune members to formulate family plans, so that the production plans of the commune and production team are closely integrated with the family plans of commune members, and are established on a more reliable basis.
    Helping commune members formulate family plans, on the one hand, is to enable the production plans of the commune and team to take root; on the other hand, it is to enable commune members to better arrange their labor, housework and household sideline production, understand income and expenditure, and implement the spirit of thrift and frugality. This approach is welcomed by the majority of commune members. In Fenggezhuang People's Commune in Laiyang County, there are more than 8,600 commune member households. After the commune put forward this call, more than 8,100 households formulated family plans within a few days. Most of the commune members in Chengguan Commune in Tancheng County have also formulated plans. The main contents of the family plan are: how many workdays each member of the family will do throughout the year; how much fertilizer will be delivered to the commune; how many pigs will be raised, and how many chickens and ducks will be fed; the family's annual income and expenditure budget, and how to arrange the family's income and expenditure according to the spirit of thrift and frugality. Xu Mingui, a commune member of Cao Village Production Team in Chengguan Commune, Tancheng County, has a family of six, with four able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers. Previously, two semi-able-bodied laborers did not work much. This time, when formulating the family plan, the whole family was very motivated. In order to realize the team's grain production plan this year, the whole family decided that all four able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers should participate in labor. Their specific plan is: to work 846 workdays throughout the year; to accumulate 65,000 jin of fertilizer; to raise five pigs and ten chickens; according to the team's plan, the family's total annual wages and sideline income is 1,083 yuan. In addition to the family's living expenses, there is still a surplus of 700 to 800 yuan. After this calculation, adults and children are all overjoyed.
    In the process of formulating family plans, commune members have held family meetings to carefully study the family's production and living conditions, so that they can more actively solve the specific problems in the family. Sun Fang, a commune member of Fenggezhuang Commune in Laiyang County, is disabled and cannot work. A family of four relies solely on his wife to earn wages. This time, when formulating the family plan, the couple came up with ways to raise bees and rabbits. The husband is responsible for raising bees and rabbits, and the wife participates in labor in the commune. According to the calculation, the annual income is enough to use. His wife said happily: "I used to worry that my salary alone was not enough for the family to use. Now that a plan has been formulated, there are more ways to earn income. I am really happy with the plan."
    By helping commune members formulate family plans, not only has it educated commune members in thrift and household management, but it has also been an education in patriotism and love for the commune, which has played a significant role in inspiring commune members to work hard and stimulating their enthusiasm for production. In Cao Village Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Tancheng County, after 83 commune member households formulated family plans, they added 36 pigs and more than 100 chickens within seven days. After the people's communes in Laiyang, Chiping and other counties formulated family plans, the number of labor attendance has generally increased compared to the past. In order to ensure the realization of the plans of the commune, the team and the family, many commune members have also formulated commune love covenants or family covenants to ensure active participation in labor, compliance with discipline, obedience to commands, and care for public property. At the same time, it also further facilitates the commune and the team to arrange production and rationally organize the use of labor. Some team cadres reflected: In the past, they were not very clear about how many people attended work, how many workdays they worked, and how much fertilizer they accumulated in a year, a season, or a short period of time; now they know the bottom line, and it is easier to plan the work.

    莱阳等地社员订家庭计划
    把集体生产同家庭副业结合起来
    把爱国爱社同勤俭持家结合起来
    本报济南27日电  山东省莱阳、郯城、茌平等县的人民公社，在社、队订出全年生产计划的基础上，帮助社员户户制订家庭计划，使公社、生产队的生产计划同社员家庭计划密切结合起来，建立在更可靠的基础上。
    帮助社员制订家庭计划，一方面是使社、队的生产计划扎下根；另一方面是使社员很好地安排自己的劳动、家务和家庭副业生产，了解收支情况，贯彻执行勤俭持家的精神，这种作法受到广大社员的欢迎。莱阳县冯格庄人民公社共有八千六百多户社员，当公社提出这一号召后，几天之内就有八千一百多户订出了家庭计划。郯城县城关公社多数社员也都已订出了计划。家庭计划的主要内容是：全家每人全年干多少劳动日；向社投多少肥；养多少猪，喂多少鸡、鸭；全家全年收入、开支概算以及如何根据勤俭持家的精神安排全家的收支等。郯城县城关公社曹村生产大队的社员徐敏桂，全家六口人，四个整半劳力，从前有两个半劳动力是不大干活的，这次订家庭计划，全家人的积极性都很高。为了实现全队今年粮食生产计划，全家决定四个整半劳力全部参加劳动。他们的具体计划是：全年干八百四十六个劳动日；积肥六万五千斤；养五头猪、十只鸡；根据队内的计划，全家全年工资和副业收入共计一千零八十三元，除了全家生活开支外，还剩余七、八百元。这样一算，大人小孩都欢天喜地。
    社员们在制订家庭计划中，都开了家庭会，仔细地研究了全家的生产、生活状况，使他们更能主动地解决家中的具体问题。莱阳县冯格庄公社社员孙芳身体残废，不能干活，一家四口人，只靠他妻子挣工资。这次订家庭计划时，夫妻二人想出了养蜂、养兔的门路，丈夫负责养蜂、养兔，妻子参加社内劳动，计算起来，全年收入满够用的。他妻子高兴地说：“以前俺愁着光我一人挣工资不够家里用的，现在一订出计划，收入门路多了，真是做了计划喜在心。”
    通过帮助社员制订家庭计划，不仅是对社员进行了一次勤俭理家的教育，而且也是一次爱国爱社的教育，这对鼓舞社员干劲、激发社员生产积极性起到了显著的作用。郯城县城关公社曹村生产队的八十三户社员，户户订出家庭计划后，七天内就添猪三十六头，添鸡一百多只。莱阳、茌平等县的人民公社订出家庭计划后，劳动出勤数比过去普遍增加。很多社员为保证实现社、队和家庭的计划，还订出了爱社公约或家庭公约，保证积极参加劳动、遵守纪律、听从指挥、爱护公共财物。同时，也进一步地便利了社、队安排生产、合理组织使用劳力。有些队干部反映：过去对一年、一季或一小段究竟有多少人出勤，干多少劳动日，积多少肥等情况，总是不大摸底；现在可摸着底了，活路也好打算了。  （宋杰）
