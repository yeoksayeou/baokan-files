Xinhua News Agency report:

    Shandong Province is accelerating the construction of twenty-one simple coal washeries in the Zibo, Zaozhuang, and other coal mining areas. Among these washeries, seven have already completed their civil engineering work and are expected to begin coal washing by the end of the month; the rest will be handed over for production in stages over the next two months.

    Shandong Province bears the arduous task of supporting key enterprises in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places with pig iron and high-quality coal. However, the province currently has only one coal washery with an annual output of 600,000 tons, which is far from meeting the needs of the objective situation. The batch of simple coal washeries currently under construction requires less investment and has a fast construction speed. Once fully completed, they can wash 9.3 million tons of coal annually. This will play a significant role in improving the quality of pig iron in the province and supporting key enterprises with more high-quality coal. (Picture attached)

    The Matou Coal Washery (also known as the Fengfeng Central Coal Washery), a large-scale highly mechanized and automated coal washery being built with Soviet assistance, is under intensive construction. Once completed, this coal washery will be able to produce 1.2 million tons of high-quality coal annually to supply the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

    山东兴建21座简易洗选厂
    据新华社讯　山东省正在淄博、枣庄等煤矿区加紧兴建二十一座简易洗选厂。在这些洗选厂中，目前已有七座完成了土建工程，预计月底即可开始洗煤；其余将在今后两个月内分期移交生产。
    山东省担负着支援上海、武汉等地重点企业生铁、精煤的艰巨任务，但是全省目前只有一座年产六十万吨的洗选厂，远远不能适应客观形势的需要。正在兴建的这批简易洗选厂，投资少，建设速度快，全部建成后，每年可以洗选煤九百三十万吨。这对提高全省的生铁质量和支援重点企业更多的精煤，将起重大的作用。（附图片）
    苏联帮助我国建设的一座高度机械化、自动化的大型洗选厂——马头洗选厂（又名峰峰中央洗选厂）正加紧建设。这座洗选厂建成后，每年能产一百二十万吨精煤供应武钢和石景山钢铁厂。
