    Redouble Efforts to Safeguard World Peace
    ——Written for the Tenth Anniversary of the World Peace Movement
    Li Dequan

    Peace-loving people all over the world are warmly celebrating the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement. Over the past decade, countless vivid facts have demonstrated the strength of the world's peace forces and have also proven that the socialist countries, together with all peace-loving countries and peoples, cherish peace and their desire for unity and friendship, which cannot be obstructed by any force.

    Since the founding of the new China, the peace-loving Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have been diligently and bravely building their own country. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, everyone was in high spirits and full of energy, highly developing the spirit of selfless labor and hard work. With the great spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, they vigorously carried out the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, so that in a short period of time, the development of China's industry, agriculture, culture, education, health and other undertakings has seen some unprecedented miracles, presenting a new and inspiring look. What is particularly gratifying is that the relationship between people in our country has been further changed, moving towards mutual help, unity and fraternity.

    On the occasion of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement, the Chinese people are even more determined to unite with the socialist peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and peoples, and redouble their efforts to strive for the maintenance of lasting world peace!

    加倍努力维护世界和平
    ——为世界和平运动十周年而作
    李德全
    全世界爱好和平的人民都热烈纪念世界和平运动十周年。十年来，无数生动的事实显示了世界和平力量的强大，也证明了社会主义国家与世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民爱好和平和他们之间团结友好的愿望，是任何力量也阻挠不了的。
    热爱和平的中国人民自从新中国成立以来，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，勤劳勇敢地建设着自己的国家，特别是在1958年的大跃进中，人人意气风发，干劲冲天，高度地发挥了忘我劳动和刻苦钻研的精神，以敢想、敢说、敢做的伟大气魄，大搞技术革命和文化革命，以致在短短的时间中，使我国的工业、农业和文教卫生种种事业的发展，出现了若干史无前例的奇迹，呈现出令人欢欣鼓舞的崭新面貌。尤其令人高兴的是在我国人与人之间的关系进一步地得到了改变，走向着互相帮助、团结友爱的方向。
    在庆祝世界和平运动十周年的今天，中国人民更加坚决地和以苏联为首的社会主义和平阵营以及一切爱好和平的国家与人民团结一致，加倍努力地为维护世界持久和平而奋斗！
