Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th -- According to the "Havana Post," all circles in Cuba recently erected a monument to commemorate the Chinese workers who heroically died in the Cuban wars against Spanish colonial rule in 1868 and 1895.

The monument's body is carved from a large piece of granite, and a bronze plaque is embedded on the base, inscribed with the words of Gonzalo de Quesada y Aróstegui, the national hero who led the struggle at that time, praising the Chinese martyrs: "In Cuba's struggle for independence, not a single Chinese became a traitor, nor did a single Chinese become a deserter." It is reported that in that era of resistance against colonial rule, hundreds of Chinese workers who had been abducted by the Spanish to work in Cuban sugarcane fields joined the Cuban Liberation Army, and their bravery and loyalty won people's praise.

    新华社6日讯　哈瓦那消息：据“哈瓦那邮报”报道，古巴各界最近建立了一个纪念碑，以悼念在1868年和1895年古巴反西班牙殖民统治战争中壮烈殉难的中国工人。
    纪念碑的碑身是用一块高大的花岗岩琢成的，底座上嵌有一块铜牌，上面铭刻着领导当时斗争的民族英雄冈萨洛·德克萨达—阿罗斯特吉赞扬中国烈士的话：“在古巴的独立斗争中，没有一个中国人成为叛徒，也没有一个中国人成为逃兵”。据报道说，在那个反抗殖民统治的年代里，被西班牙人劫至古巴甘蔗园里工作的中国工人成百地参加了古巴解放军，他们的英勇和忠节博到了人们的赞颂。
