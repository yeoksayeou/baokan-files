Committee member Cun Shusheng talks about the implementation of the Party's education policy at Yunnan University

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

The State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and quell the Tibetan rebellion is a wise measure that strengthens the unity of all nationalities in the country, consolidates the unification of the motherland, and is in the interests of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. I express my firm support for it.

Now I will speak about the implementation of the Party and government's education policy at Yunnan University.

Our education policy is: education serves the politics of the proletariat, and education is combined with productive labor. We deeply realize that the process of implementing this policy is also a process of struggle between two roads in education. The vast majority of teachers in schools are bourgeois intellectuals. Generally speaking, they lack the working class worldview, their socialist and communist ideological awareness is not high, and they have bourgeois ideas of varying degrees that are divorced from reality, politics, and productive labor. These ideas directly become obstacles in the implementation of the Party and government's education policy. During the rampant attack on the Party and socialism by bourgeois rightists in the summer of 1957, the rightists even openly demanded that the Party withdraw from schools and negated the proletariat's leadership over education. After the victory of the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification campaign, followed by the participation of teachers and students in labor and the establishment of factories and farms by schools last year, most teachers have made varying degrees of improvement in politics and ideology. They have made great progress in implementing the principle of education serving proletarian politics and the combination of education and productive labor, and have achieved considerable success. The Party's leadership over education has been strengthened and consolidated. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "The achievements of our education are not only reflected in the quantitative development. More importantly, under the greatly strengthened leadership of the Party over education, we have implemented the principle of education serving the politics of the working class and the combination of education and productive labor in accordance with the working class worldview and socialist and communist education principles, thereby unfolding a huge and profound revolution in education."

The Harvest of Downward Transfer for Tempering

Last year, under the impetus of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, we followed the Central Committee's instructions on the downward transfer of cadres for labor tempering, and successively sent 226 teachers and staff members (50.2% of the total number of teachers and staff) to rural areas or factories for labor tempering (for periods ranging from one month to one year). In terms of students: we implemented the "one, three, eight" school system, ran factories on campus in combination with study and labor, and successively had 921 students (43.8% of the total number of students) participate in and support the major battles for steel, iron, copper and autumn harvesting and planting in factories, mines and rural areas. Through labor practice, teachers and students have improved to varying degrees in labor and ideological style. In terms of ideology and emotion, they have begun to criticize and overcome the erroneous ideas of despising workers and peasants as uncultured, considering workers and peasants backward, and "manual labor as base." They ideologically acknowledged that the working people are the creators of history and social wealth, and humbly learned from the workers and peasants, so some teachers posted the couplet "Today I am willing to be a primary school student, tomorrow I am willing to be a willing ox." Some students said: "In the past, what I was most interested in was a good movie, a pair of good leather shoes, now what I am most interested in is a good carrying pole." They began to change the situation of "not working with their limbs and not knowing the five grains", and initially learned some basic skills and practical knowledge of industrial and agricultural labor. The vast majority of teachers and students are no longer averse to labor, and generally learn the style of hard work and simplicity of workers and peasants in their lifestyle. Ideologically, they acknowledged the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, recognized the great significance of the Great Leap Forward, and overcame doubts about the Great Leap Forward. They said: "In the past, when I saw the news of the Great Leap Forward in the newspapers, I was half-convinced, but now I feel that the reports are not enough...". In the practice of labor, they gradually realized the necessity and importance of bourgeois intellectuals transforming their thinking through labor, and realized that "what is really dirty is not the workers and peasants but our own thinking." Therefore, many teachers and students proposed "to use the excellent qualities of the working class as a mirror to criticize their own bourgeois ideas", and changed the misconception that labor tempering was "rectifying intellectuals". The working masses gave their support and encouragement to this transformation. Some peasants wrote poems saying: "In the spring, the peach blossoms are red, Yunnan University comrades come to 'three togethers', eating, living, and working together, guaranteeing to be both specialized and red." Teachers and students, through collective labor in schools, especially after the "three togethers" with workers and peasants, began to understand the feelings of the working people and the greatness of collective strength. Teachers and students, in actively participating in compiling teaching materials and conducting scientific research, realized that the wisdom of the masses is endless. All of these helped to strengthen the mass viewpoint and collective viewpoint of teachers and students. Because teachers and students participated in the practice of productive labor, they had a better understanding of the study of Marxism-Leninism theory. For example, 1,954 students participated in 158 Mao Zedong's works study groups, combining theory with practice, understanding that problems should be viewed from reality and comprehensively; subjectivism decreased, and materialism increased; one-sided viewpoints decreased, and dialectical viewpoints increased. They have achieved great gains in both theory and ideology. In general, due to the establishment and strengthening of labor viewpoints, mass viewpoints, and dialectical materialist viewpoints among the vast majority of teachers and students, the working class ideology in schools has been strengthened, and they love the Party and socialist cause more. The number of people who have formulated plans to join the Party has reached 438, accounting for 16.4% of the total number of students. The above situation shows that Yunnan University, in implementing the Party's "education serves the political interests of the working class, and education is combined with productive labor" policy, is moving in the direction pointed out in Premier Zhou's report, "In our schools, we must earnestly carry out socialist and communist ideological and political education to raise students' socialist consciousness;... to combine mental labor and physical labor," "so that schools will increasingly develop into a new type of school that cultivates communist new people."

The Improvement of Teaching Quality

The changes in the improvement of teaching quality after the implementation of the education policy are also very significant. Because students have enriched their practical knowledge from productive labor, they have changed from "reading dead books" to "reading live books." Science students have combined their majors with labor, not only starting to use the knowledge they have learned, but also being able to install machines, instruments, and analyze various materials. Liberal arts students have compiled factory history and commune history after working in factories and rural areas. Chinese language students have begun to understand "what is the real source of creation". History students have begun to understand what history is, who is the creator of history, who is the master of history, and realized that historical science can serve socialism, overcoming the one-sided views such as "history cannot produce grain or steel." After criticizing the academic authority ideas of the bourgeoisie, students broke away from superstition, liberated their minds, and compiled more than 6 million words of teaching materials for 62 courses. Although the teaching materials are relatively rough, the direction is correct. For example, in the literary history of the Chinese language department, the literature of the working people was neglected in the past. After students participated in the compilation, they attached importance to the position of people's literature. In the process of compiling teaching materials, a vigorous reading movement and writing movement were formed, which increased a lot of knowledge and clarified many arguments. After listening to lectures and discussing and revising teaching materials, they were able to master knowledge more firmly. At the same time, due to the improvement of students' political awareness, their learning goals and learning attitudes were more correct than in the past, their professional ideas were consolidated, most of them established the spirit of hard work, and their ability to work independently was enhanced. Compared with 1957, the examination results of this semester show that "excellent" accounted for 45.3%, "good" accounted for 34.05%, passing accounted for 15.57%, and failing accounted for 3.09%, while in 1957, "excellent" only accounted for 32.61%, "good" accounted for 31.29%, passing accounted for 24.24%, and failing accounted for 8.6%.

The Progress of Scientific Research

The publication of the general line and the promotion of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, combined with the study of education policy, made us clear the direction of scientific research serving production and socialist construction, thereby making the scientific research of Yunnan University develop vigorously. What we didn't dare to do or even think about in the past, we dare to do and think about now. For example, the science department has completed the extraction of several rare elements, completed the trial production of small electrostatic accelerators, small electron induction accelerators, small cyclotron accelerators, etc., trial-produced a general-purpose analog electronic computer that can solve fourth-order differential equations, synthesized bitter almond acid, violet copper, corpus luteum copper, and extracted tannic acid chemicals, etc. Teachers and students of the history department compiled more than 300,000 words of mine history, sorted out 70,000 words of miners' memoirs, 180,000 words of data compilation, and 25,000 words of Red Army memoirs. Teachers and students of the Chinese language department participated in the national folk literature survey and national survey team work led by the provincial party committee, and investigated and compiled more than 300,000 pieces of national literature and works.

In order to implement the principle of combining education with productive labor and establish production bases, Yunnan University has been running many factories since July 1958, reaching more than 70 at the most, producing iron ore, native iron, refractory bricks, bacterial fertilizer, chemical medicines, anhydrous alcohol, ether, interferometers, and other organic acids, with a total output value of 700,000 yuan and a net profit of 280,000 yuan. Although these achievements are still very small, they are in line with the spirit of Premier Zhou's statement that "our children and youth must systematically master cultural knowledge and modern scientific achievements step by step", that education "serves the socialist cause", "through the practice of productive labor;... strongly promoted scientific research work", "in full-time formal schools at all levels, improving teaching quality should be taken as a regular and basic task,... in order to train specialized personnel of higher quality for the country and rapidly promote the improvement of our country's scientific and cultural level".

In general, Yunnan University, like other universities across the country, has undergone important changes in the political and ideological outlook of teachers and students, in teaching quality, and in the service of scientific research and socialist construction due to the implementation of the Party's education policy and the education revolution. This change means the victory of the proletarian education policy over the bourgeois education policy in China's education cause, the bright future of bourgeois intellectuals transforming themselves under the leadership of the Party, and the consolidation of the Party's leadership in cultural and educational undertakings.

Although we still have many shortcomings and problems in implementing the Party and government's education policy, mainly the time arrangement for teaching and labor, teaching and scientific research, the appropriate distribution of practical courses and basic courses, and theoretical courses are not perfect, and we do not give enough play to the leading role of teachers in teaching, etc., but these are inevitable shortcomings in the process of progress. As Chairman Mao said, it is a matter of nine fingers and one finger. They are not only able to be overcome, but also have been and are being gradually overcome and resolved. We believe that on the basis of summing up the experience of the past year, the education policy formulated by the Party will surely exert its tremendous revolutionary power on a broader and deeper scale, and a greater and higher socialist cultural and educational upsurge will come with the greater leap forward in the country's economic construction.

专栏：

    思想、知识、生产齐丰收
    寸树声委员谈云南大学执行党的教育方针的情况主席团、各位委员：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    国务院所发布的解散原西藏地方政府和平定西藏叛乱的命令，是加强全国各民族的团结，巩固祖国的统一符合于西藏人民利益和符合于全国人民利益的英明措施，我表示坚决拥护。
    现在我就云南大学执行党和政府的教育方针的情况作如下发言。
    我国的教育方针是：教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合。我们深刻地体会到，执行这个方针的过程，也是在教育事业中进行两条道路的斗争的过程。学校中绝大多数的教师是资产阶级知识分子。一般地说，他们缺乏工人阶级的世界观，社会主义、共产主义的思想觉悟不高，存在着程度不同的脱离实际、脱离政治、脱离生产劳动的资产阶级思想。这些思想直接成为在贯彻执行党和政府的教育方针的障碍。一九五七年夏季资产阶级右派分子向党向社会主义猖狂进攻时，右派甚至公然要求党退出学校，否定无产阶级对教育事业的领导。经过反右派斗争和整风的胜利，接着去年一年师生参加劳动和学校办工厂、农场等生产实践，多数教师在政治、思想上有了不同程度的提高，在贯彻执行教育为无产阶级政治服务和教育与生产劳动相结合的方针上，大大的前进了一步，取得不小的成绩。党对教育工作的领导加强了，巩固了，正如周总理在报告中指出，“我国教育事业的成就不只是表现在数量的发展上。更重要的是，在党对教育工作的领导大大加强的条件下，我们按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命。”
    下放锻炼的收获
    去年在工农业生产大跃进形势的推动下，我们遵照中央关于干部下放劳动锻炼的指示，曾先后下放教师、职员二百二十六人（占教职员总数的百分之五十点二），到农村或工厂劳动锻炼（时间由一个月到一年）；在学生方面：实行了“一、三、八”的学制，在校内大办工厂结合学习进行劳动，并先后有九百二十一人（占学生总数的百分之四十三点八）到厂矿、农村参加和支援大战钢、铁、铜和秋收秋种。通过劳动实践，师生在劳动上和思想作风上都有不同程度的提高，在思想感情上，开始批判和克服了轻视工农没有文化、认为工农落后、“体力劳动卑贱”等错误思想，从思想上承认劳动人民是历史和社会财富的创造者，放下架子虚心向工农群众学习，因而有的教师贴出了“今日甘当小学生，明日甘当孺子牛”的对联。有的学生说：“过去我最感兴趣的是一场好电影，一双好皮鞋，现在最感兴趣的是一付好挑子。”开始改变了“四体不勤，五谷不分”的情况，初步学会了一些工农业劳动的基本技能和实际知识。绝大多数教师学生已不厌弃劳动，生活作风上一般都学习到工农的艰苦朴素的作风。在思想上，他们承认了工农的冲天干劲，认识到大跃进的伟大意义，克服了对大跃进的怀疑，他们说：“过去看见报纸上登的大跃进消息是半信半疑，现在反觉得报导得不够……”。在劳动实践中，他们也逐渐认识到资产阶级知识分子通过劳动去改造思想的必要性和重要性，认识到“真正脏的不是工农而是我们自己的思想”。因而不少师生提出“要用工人阶级的优良品质作为一面镜子来批判自己的资产阶级思想”，改变了认为劳动锻炼是“整知识分子”的错误看法。工农劳动群众对他们这种转变，给予了支持和鼓励。有的农民做了诗歌说：“春季里，桃花红，云大同志来三同，同吃同住同劳动，保证做到专又红。”师生通过校内集体劳动，特别是与工农三同后，开始体会了劳动人民的感情和集体力量的伟大。教师学生在积极参加编写讲义、大搞科学研究中，认识到群众智慧无穷无尽。这些都有助于加强师生的群众观点及集体观点。由于师生参加了生产劳动的实践，对马克思列宁主义理论的学习就有了较好的理解。如在学生中有一千九百五十四人参加组成了一百五十八个毛泽东著作学习小组，结合实际进行学习，懂得了看问题要从实际出发，要全面；主观主义减少了，唯物主义增多了；片面观点减少了，辩证观点增多了。在理论上和思想上都取得了较大的收获。总起来说，由于在广大师生中树立和加强了劳动观点、群众观点和辩证唯物主义观点，使学校内工人阶级思想有所增强，更热爱党，热爱社会主义事业。制定入党计划的人达到四百三十八人，占全校人数百分之十六点四。以上这些情况，说明云南大学在贯彻执行党的“教育为工人阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针”之中，正向着周总理的报告中所指出的“在我们的学校里必须认真地进行社会主义、共产主义的思想政治教育，提高学生的社会主义觉悟；……使脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合”，“使得学校日益发展成为培养共产主义新人的新型学校”的方向前进。
    教学质量的提高
    在教学质量的提高方面，贯彻教育方针之后的变化也是很显著的。由于学生从生产劳动中丰富了实际知识，由“读死书”变成了“读活书”。理科学生结合专业进行了劳动，不但开始运用已学的知识，而且能够安装机器、仪表，分析各种物质。文科的学生下厂下乡劳动后，编写了工厂史、公社史。中文系学生开始懂得了“什么是创作的真正源泉”。历史系学生开始懂得了什么是历史，谁是历史的创造者，谁是历史的主人，认识到历史科学是能够为社会主义服务的，克服了“历史既不能生产粮食，又不能生产钢铁”等片面看法。批判资产阶级的学术权威思想后，学生破除了迷信，解放了思想，编写了六十二门课程的六百多万字的讲义。讲义编的虽然比较粗糙，但方向是对的。如中文系的文学史，过去忽视劳动人民的文学，学生参加编写以后，则重视了人民文学的地位。在编写讲义的过程中形成了轰轰烈烈的读书运动和写作运动，这样就增长了很多知识，明确了很多论点，再经过听讲，又进行讨论修改讲义，就能够比较牢固的掌握知识。同时，由于学生政治觉悟的提高，学习目的和学习态度比过去端正了，巩固了专业思想，多数树立了刻苦钻研的精神，增强了独立工作的能力。本学期考试成绩和一九五七年相比，本学期“优”占百分之四十五点三，“良”占百分之三十四点零五，及格占百分之十五点五七，不及格占百分之三点零九，而一九五七年“优”只占百分之三十二点六一，“良”占百分之三十一点二九，及格占百分之二十四点二四，不及格占百分之八点六。
    科学研究的进步
    总路线的公布和工农业大跃进的推动，结合着教育方针的学习，使我们明确了科学研究为生产服务、为社会主义建设服务的方向，从而使云南大学的科学研究也有了蓬勃的开展。过去不敢做也不敢想的，现在敢做敢想了。如理科到目前为止完成了若干稀有原素的提取，完成了小型静电加速器、小型电子感应加速器、小型旋回加速器等试制工作，试制了一台能解四级微分方程的通用模拟式电子计算机，合成了苦香仁酸、紫罗兰铜、黄体铜，提取了丹宁素化学药品等。历史系师生编写三十多万字的矿厂史，整理出七万字的矿工回忆录，十八万字的资料汇编，二万五千字的红军回忆录。中文系的师生参加省委领导的民族民间文学调查及民族调查队工作，调查编写了民族文学及作品共三十余万件等。
    为了贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，建立生产基地，云南大学从一九五八年七月以来，办了许多工厂，最多时曾达七十余个，生产了铁矿石、土铁、耐火砖、细菌肥料、化学药品、无水酒精、乙醚、干涉仪以及其他机酸，总产值达七十万元，纯利润二十八万元。这些成绩虽然还很小，但符合周总理所说的“必须使我们的儿童和青年有系统地一步步地掌握文化知识和现代科学成就”，要使教育“为社会主义事业服务”，“通过生产劳动的实践；……有力地推动了科学研究工作”，“在各级全日制的正规学校中，应当把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务，……以便为国家培养更高质量的专门人才，迅速促进我国科学文化水平的提高”的精神的。
    总的说来，云南大学和全国其他大学一样，由于贯彻执行了党的教育方针，进行了教育革命，因而在师生的政治思想面貌上，在教学质量上，在科学研究与社会主义建设的服务上，都发生了重要的变化。这种变化是意味着我国教育事业中无产阶级教育方针对资产阶级教育方针进行斗争的胜利，意味着资产阶级知识分子在党的领导下，进行自我改造的光明前途，意味着党在文教事业上的领导的巩固。
    虽然我们在执行党和政府的教育方针中还存在许多缺点和问题，主要是教学与劳动、教学与科学研究的时间安排，实用课与基础课、理论课的适当分配等还不尽恰当，对发挥教师在教学中的主导作用不够等，但这些都是前进中不可免的缺点。正如毛主席所说，是九个指头和一个指头的问题。它们不仅是可以克服的，而且已经和正在逐步得到克服和解决。我们相信，在总结过去一年经验的基础上，党所制定的教育方针，必将在更广阔更深远的规模上发挥它的巨大的革命力量，一个更大更高的社会主义文化教育高潮，将随着祖国经济建设的更大跃进而来到。
