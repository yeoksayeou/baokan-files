Comrades, Chairman, and fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou's report provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of our great achievements and rich experiences in carrying out socialist transformation and socialist construction. Every word in the report profoundly reflects the thoughts and feelings of the broad masses of the people. As a coal miner myself, I feel especially close to and satisfied with this report.

As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "The development of the national economy in 1958 was not just ordinary progress, but a huge and comprehensive leap forward." Our Pingxiang Coal Mine also experienced a huge and comprehensive leap forward last year. The total output value increased by 158.6 percent compared to 1957, raw coal production increased by 60.2 percent, labor efficiency increased by 28.1 percent, and other economic and technical indicators, with the exception of a few items, also showed significant improvements compared to 1957.

We are not satisfied with the achievements we have already made. This year, we will continue to exert even greater effort, working hard and cleverly, and resolutely achieve an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than last year. The planned raw coal production is to increase by 70 percent compared to last year. To accomplish such a great leap forward, we must overcome many difficulties. But no matter how great the difficulties may be, they cannot intimidate us. For example, with the current shortage of pit props, under the leadership of the Party, we have tried every means to produce more coal with fewer pit props. In the first quarter of this year alone, the pit props saved enabled the country to extract more than 100,000 tons of coal, while also saving more than 730,000 yuan in funds.

Our methods for reducing pit prop consumption, in addition to vigorously promoting the already successful experience of last year, include the widespread use of hydraulic mining; increasing the recovery and reuse rate of pit props; and actively seeking substitute materials, such as bamboo supports, cement supports, ceramic supports, and cinder supports. Recently, we have also preliminarily succeeded in experimenting with the "longwall mining method in roadways," the "shortwall mining method along the strike," and the "combined mining method," which basically do not require pit props and can still ensure safe mining. Workers collectively refer to these three mining methods as pit prop-free mining methods. The first two methods are developed and created by learning from the advanced experience of Hunan, based on the characteristics of the ore-bearing coal seam. The latter method is developed from the Soviet advanced experience of "horizontal slicing mining method." Now, I will briefly introduce each of them below:

    I. Longwall Mining Method in Roadways: This method has been tested in the Qingshan Mine since December of last year and has now been successful. In the second half of March of this year, more than 5,000 tons of coal were mined using this method, and no "safety accidents" have occurred in the past few months. The mine has a steeply inclined coal seam, with a slope of 65 to 80 degrees, a very rotten roof, and a coal seam thickness of 1.6 to 4 meters, with relatively loose coal quality. Coal mining uses a small-step method. During tunneling, the strike coal pillar is made to be six meters high. After the shed returns, the top coal falls under its own weight, or long boreholes are drilled and blasted, causing the coal to fall into the strike trough. The working face is not supported, and workers operate in the strike trough, never entering the working face.

    II. Shortwall Mining Method Along the Strike: This method began to be tested in the Hujiafang mining area in February of this year and has now been basically successful. The mine has a coal seam thickness of 1.8 to 3 meters, a dip of 35 to 45 degrees, a solid roof, and medium-hard coal quality. The mining method also uses a small-step method. The strike coal pillar is six meters high, and the working face is gradually shortened along the strike. The working face is not supported, and long boreholes are used to blast and drop the coal.

    III. Combined Mining Method: This method has also been basically successfully tested in the Qingshan Mine, and preparations are being made to begin testing in the thick coal seam of the Gaokeng Mine in May. The mining method also uses a shortwall method along the strike. The strike coal pillar is 10.8 meters high. After the shed returns, the coal from the previous small stage falls under its own weight, or long boreholes are used to blast and drop the coal. If it can be combined with hydraulic mining, the effect will be even greater.

These three mining methods have the following advantages:

      (1) Safety. Because workers operate in strike troughs with good supports, they do not enter the working face.
      (2) High Efficiency. According to the summary of Qingshan Mine, under the same conditions, the working face using the combined mining method can improve efficiency by 157 percent compared to the old method, and the working face using the longwall mining method in roadways can improve efficiency by 37 percent compared to the old method.
      (3) Saving Pit Props. According to the statistics of Qingshan Mine, the national quota for pit prop consumption per thousand tons of coal is 14 cubic meters. The working face using the combined mining method has reduced the actual consumption from 14.39 cubic meters to 3.13 cubic meters, a reduction of 28.3 percent. The working face using the longwall mining method in roadways has reduced the actual pit prop consumption per thousand tons of coal from an average of 10.89 cubic meters to 2.1 cubic meters, a reduction of 80 percent.
      (4) Less roadway tunneling, thus speeding up the tunneling speed. The distance between strike troughs in the old mining method is 27 meters, while the new mining method is 6 meters and 10.8 meters. For the same amount of production, the footage of roadway tunneling is only one-half or one-third of the original.
      (5) Greatly Reduced Costs. Reduced pit prop consumption. Reducing the footage of roadway tunneling also reduces investment and lowers costs. According to the statistics of Qingshan Mine in March, the working face using the longwall mining method in roadways reduced costs by 5 percent in March. This was still in the experimental stage in the past, and will be greatly reduced in the future.

The disadvantage of the new mining method is that the coal recovery rate is slightly lower than the old method, but it can still basically meet the standards stipulated by the state. Because this is a new method, our experience is not enough, and we need to continue to improve and increase the coal recovery rate in the future. In the current situation of pit prop shortage, our mine has decided to vigorously promote it based on coal seam conditions.

Recently, some Chinese and foreign experts have conducted research and appraisal, and unanimously believe that pit prop-free mining should be the direction of future development. They have given high praise and great encouragement to our Pingxiang Coal Mine for the successful or basically successful experiments.

We, together with coal miners across the country, are working to overfulfill the state's target of 380 million tons of coal this year. The mine Party committee has proposed to complete 80 percent of the annual plan before October 1st, producing 4 million tons of coal as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. This call has been enthusiastically responded to by all employees of the mine. Just a few days before I came to attend the meeting, the famous advanced producer and pneumatic drill operator, Liu Benkun, made a proposal to all employees of the mine, that one person should do the work of four people. He himself immediately created a new record of 577 tons of coal mined by pneumatic drill in one shift, which is equivalent to one person doing the work of six people. A high-efficiency red flag competition movement of comparing with Liu Benkun, learning from Liu Benkun, and catching up with Liu Benkun has quickly been launched throughout the mine. I firmly believe that under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, and under the correct leadership of the Party, with the experience of the great leap forward last year, all our employees will definitely be able to victoriously realize the glorious and great task of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

### 用更少的坑木生产更多的煤  郭清泗代表的发言

    用更少的坑木生产更多的煤
    郭清泗代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告、李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。周总理的报告全面的、正确的总结了我国进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大成就和丰富经验，报告中的每一句话都极其深刻地反映了广大人民群众的思想感情，我自己是个煤矿工人，对这个报告感到格外亲切和满意。
    正如周总理在报告中所指出的，“一九五八年国民经济的发展，不是一般的前进，而是一个巨大的、全面的跃进。”我们萍乡煤矿去年也是巨大的、全面的跃进。总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之一百五十八点六，原煤产量增长了百分之六十点二，劳动效率提高了百分之二十八点一，其他经济技术指标除个别项目外，都比一九五七年有很大的提高。
    我们并不满足于已取得的成绩，今年要继续鼓足更大的干劲，苦干加巧干，坚决实现比去年更大更好更全面的跃进。计划原煤产量要比去年增加百分之七十。要完成这样一个大跃进的任务，是要克服许多困难的。但是无论有多大的困难也不能吓倒我们。比如当前坑木供应不足，我们在党的领导下，千方百计，用更少的坑木生产出了更多的煤。今年第一季度所节省的坑木，就多为国家采出了十万多吨煤，同时还节约资金七十三万多元。
    我们降低坑木消耗的办法，除大力推广去年已经成功的经验，广泛运用水力采煤；提高坑木回收复用率；积极寻找代用材料，如竹子支架，水泥支架，陶瓷支架，炉渣支架等，最近又初步试验成功基本上不用坑木又可保证安全采煤的“巷道长壁法”，“走向短壁法”，“联合采煤法”，工人们把这三种采煤法总称之为无坑木采煤法。前两种方法是学习湖南的先进经验，根据找矿煤层的特点发展创造出来的，后一种方法是根据苏联的先进经验“水平分层采煤法”发展而成。现分别简单介绍于下：
    一、巷道长壁法：从去年十二月起即开始在青山矿试验，现已成功。今年三月下半月用这个方法采出了五千多吨煤，几个月来从未发生“安全事故”。该矿是急倾斜煤层，坡度是六十五度到八十度，顶板很烂，煤层厚度一点六到四公尺，煤质较松软。采煤是采用小阶段的方式，在掘进时把顺槽煤柱做成高六公尺，回棚后，顶煤借助自重下落，或打长炮眼放炮，使煤落到顺槽内，工作面不支架，工人在顺槽内操作，根本不进入工作面。
    二、走向短壁法：今年二月开始在胡家坊矿区试验，现已基本成功。该矿煤层厚度一点八到三公尺，倾斜为三十五到四十五度，顶板结实，煤质硬度中等。采煤方式也是采用小阶段，顺槽煤柱高六公尺，沿走向把工作面逐步缩短，工作面不支架，用长炮眼放炮落煤。
    三、联合采煤法：也已在青山矿基本试验成功，并准备五月份在高坑矿的厚煤层中开始试验。采煤方式也是采用走向短壁的方式，顺槽煤柱高十点八公尺，回棚后，上一小阶段之煤借助自重下落，或用长炮眼放炮落煤，如能和水力采煤结合，效果将会更高。
    这三种采煤方法有这样几个优点：
      （1）安全。因为工人操作都是在有良好支架的顺槽内进行，不进入工作面。
      （2）效率高。据青山矿总结，在同等条件下，用联合采煤法的工作面比用老方法可提高效率百分之一百五十七，用巷道长壁法的工作面比老方法提高百分之三十七。
      （3）节省坑木。根据青山矿统计，每千吨煤坑木消耗量国家定额为十四立方公尺，用联合采煤法的工作面由原来实际消耗十四点三九立方公尺降低到三点一三立方公尺，降低了百分之二十八点三，用巷道长壁法采煤的工作面，由平均每千吨煤实际消耗坑木十点八九立方公尺降低到二点一立方公尺，降低了百分之八十。
      （4）掘进巷道少，因而加快了掘进速度。老采煤方法顺槽之间的距离是二十七公尺，新采煤方法是六公尺和十点八公尺，在相等的获得量内，掘进巷道的进尺数量只有原来的二分之一或三分之一。
      （5）成本大大降低。降低了坑木消耗。减少了掘进巷道进尺，也就减少了投资，降低了成本。据青山矿三月份统计，用巷道长壁法采煤的工作面三月份降低成本百分之五。过去还是试验阶段，今后还将大大降低。
    新采煤方法的缺点是煤的回收率比老方法低一点，但还是能基本上达到国家规定的标准，因为这是新的方法，我们的经验还不够，需要在今后继续不断地改进，提高煤的回收率。在当前坑木缺乏的情况下，我矿决定根据煤层条件大力推广。
    近据一些中外专家研究鉴定，一致认为无坑木采煤法，应作为今后发展的方向，对我们萍矿已经试验成功或基本成功，给予了很高的评价和很大的鼓励。
    我们同全国煤矿工人一道，为超额完成国家今年三亿八千万吨煤的任务，矿党委提出要在十月一日以前完成年计划的百分之八十，生产出四百万吨煤向国庆十周年献礼。这个号召已经得到了全矿职工的热烈响应，就在我来出席会议的前几天，著名先进生产者、风镐手刘本坤，向全矿职工提出了一项倡议，一个人做四个人的工作，他自己随即创造了一班风镐采煤五百七十七吨的新纪录，等于一个人干了六个人的活。全矿迅速掀起了一个比刘本坤、学刘本坤、赶刘本坤的高工效红旗竞赛运动。我坚决相信，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在党的正确领导下，有去年大跃进的经验，我们全矿职工一定能够胜利地实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的光荣伟大任务。
