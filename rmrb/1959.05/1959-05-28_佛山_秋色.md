Foshan's "Autumn Colors" are famous throughout the country.

Foshan City was formerly one of China's four major towns (Hankou, Zhuxian, Jingde, Foshan). Legend has it that during the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, when someone was reclaiming a barren hill called Tapo, they unearthed a stone tablet and three bronze Buddhas. From the inscription on the tablet, it was learned that as early as the Long'an period of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the Indian monk Dapi Yeshe尊者 had lectured here and built a Tapo Temple scripture hall at the foot of Tapo Hill. After the Tapo Temple scripture hall collapsed, later generations rebuilt Tapo Temple on the original site and called this Tapo Hill Foshan (Buddha Mountain).

Because Foshan is located at the junction of the West River and the North River, merchants gathered, and it gradually prospered, becoming a famous town. By the Ming Dynasty, industry and commerce were even more developed, especially handicrafts, with cast iron, pigments, and pottery being the most prominent and enjoying a high reputation.

In the past, ordinary manual workers in Foshan generally believed in deities and ancestral masters. Every spring and autumn festival and on the birthday of the ancestral master, the wise working people used their ingenuity to create various lanterns and lifelike works of art to add to the lively atmosphere. This is the popular "Autumn Colors."

The creation of "Autumn Colors" can be traced back to the Zhengtong period of the Ming Dynasty (1636-1649). At that time, a monk skilled in handicrafts lived in the Lingying Temple (commonly known as the Ancestral Temple) in Foshan. In addition to ringing the bell and chanting Buddhist scriptures, he gathered three or four people with similar interests, divided the work, and displayed the finished products in the temple for mutual appreciation. The news gradually spread, and people gathered their works in the cool autumn and paraded them in the town for exhibition. Later, it was further enhanced, and each parade was accompanied by gongs and drums, hence the name "Autumn Colors"; villagers also called it "Chu Qiujing" (Parading Autumn Scenery).

Each time "Chu Qiuse" was held, the tradition was to have shops initiate it. In the past, the Foshan area was divided into shop communities, with the entire town divided into several shops, such as Fen Shui Shop, Fu Wen Shop, and Xizhu Zhiyi Shop. All public activities were initiated by the shops separately. Small-scale "Chu Qiuse" activities were mostly organized by one shop. After a shop initiated it, other shops were unwilling to be left out and followed suit one after another. If it was a large-scale Qiuse, it would be jointly organized by several shops.

"Chu Qiuse" activities were held at night. Under the illumination of torches and lanterns, the procession was lively, resembling a游龙(dragon). The essence of the entire "Autumn Colors" team was handicrafts. These were made by artists using common waste materials and inexpensive things—shaved firewood, fish scales, peanut shells, sweet potatoes, taro, papayas, jelly, flour, clay, paper pulp, silkworm cocoons, and pigments—as raw materials to imitate various equipment. The method can be roughly divided into three types. One type is sculpture: such as sculpting bronze and pottery tripods, cauldrons, antiques, and playthings, with an antique flavor, resembling treasures. Another type is needlework: using needles to prick out calligraphy and painting patterns on paper or silk, or using thin shavings of wood and waste materials such as fish scales and fruit shells, delicately assembling umbrellas, fans, lanterns, and stories, which are exquisite and delicate. One type is lifelike creations: using clay powder and pigments to knead flying birds and running animals. Under the ingenious hands of the artists, these finished products are lifelike and almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

Therefore, "Chu Qiuse" is not only a kind of folk entertainment, but also an art creation. Unfortunately, the artists lived a hard life under reactionary rule, and the art of Qiuse had been submerged for a long time! After liberation, with the care of the Party and the government, it was discovered and the "Foshan Qiuse Craft Cooperative" was established to better lead, research, and organize this folk art. It is conceivable that this folk art will be further developed in the future.

    佛山“秋色”
    李星孙
    佛山的“秋色”是驰名全国的。
    佛山市原是中国四大镇（汉口、朱仙、景德、佛山）之一。相传在唐朝贞观二年的时候，有人在这里开垦一个名叫塔坡的荒岗时，发掘出一块石碑和三尊铜佛。从碑文上知道，远在东晋隆安二年就曾有过印度僧人达毗耶舍尊者在此地讲经，并在塔坡岗下建设过一间塔坡寺经堂。塔坡寺经堂倒塌以后，后人就在原址重建塔坡寺，并把这个塔坡岗称为佛山。
    由于佛山地处西江和北江两江的要冲，商旅云集，逐渐繁盛起来，成为名镇。到了明代，工商业更为发达，尤其是手工业，最突出的铸铁、颜料和陶器等，都享有盛名。
    从前，佛山的一般手作工人，都普遍信仰神道和祖师。每逢春秋佳节以及祖师诞辰，智慧的劳动人民便各运匠心，创作各种灯彩和像生艺术品来增加热闹气氛，这就是脍炙人口的“秋色”。
    “秋色”的创始，要溯源于明朝的正统年间（1636年——1649年）。当时佛山灵应祠（俗称祖庙）住着一个精于手工艺术的和尚，他在敲钟念佛之余，集合三几个有同好的人，分工制作并将成品陈列庙里，互相观摩。消息渐渐向外传播，人们在秋凉时候，便汇集作品，到镇上游行展出。以后更踵事增华，每届游行，还加以鼓乐助兴，所以有“秋色”之名；乡人又称作“出秋景”。
    每一次出秋色，向例以铺发起。从前佛山地面，划分铺社，全镇分为若干铺，如：汾水铺、富文铺和西竺直义铺之类，一切公众活动，都分别由各铺发动。小规模的出秋色，多以一铺为单位，某铺发起之后，他铺不甘寂寞，也闻风而起，接踵举行。若是大规模的秋色，则由好几铺联合举行。
    出秋色是在晚上活动。火炬繁灯照耀之下，队伍活跃，有似游龙。整队“秋色”里的精华，以手工艺品为主体。这些是艺人们利用一般废料和不值钱的东西——刨柴、鱼鳞、花生壳、薯、芋、木瓜、凉粉、面粉、坭头、纸扑、蚕茧和颜料之类为原料，仿制成各种各样的器材。作法大概可分为三种。一种是雕塑类：如塑制铜陶鼎鼐骨董玩器的塑形，古色古香，仿若瑰宝。一种是针砌类：用针在纸帛上刺出字画图案，或用轻薄刨口柴和鱼鳞果壳等废料，精砌伞扇明灯故事，玲珑透剔，纤细工致。一种是像生类：利用坭粉颜料，捏造飞禽、走兽。在艺人们的匠心巧手下，这些制作出来的成品，形态毕肖，几乎可以乱真。
    所以出秋色不单是一种民间娱乐，而且是有艺术创造的。可惜在反动统治下的艺人们生活艰苦，秋色艺术已经淹没多时！解放后，在党和政府的关怀下，才被发掘出来，并成立了“佛山秋色工艺社”，以便更好地领导，研究和整理这项民间艺术。可以想见，今后这种民间艺术将会得到更大的发展。
