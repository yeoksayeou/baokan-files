The October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement
Peng Ming

"When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and you doubt there is no road, suddenly a village appears, bright flowers and thick willows." This is a good portrayal of the Chinese people's search for a way out for Chinese society before and after the great October Socialist Revolution. After the Opium War, China gradually became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Imperialism and feudalism were like two great mountains weighing down on the Chinese people. After the Xinhai Revolution, Yuan Shikai stole the fruits of the revolution, carrying out brutal rule internally and completely relying on imperialism externally, auctioning off China's sovereignty. After Yuan Shikai's death, Duan Qirui inherited his mantle, and his methods and results of betraying the country and harming the people were even worse than Yuan Shikai's. In order to achieve the so-called military unification, Duan Qirui actively borrowed huge sums from Japan under various names to use as funds for civil war. Japan used this to control China's economic and political power.

On the one hand, under the crazy aggression of imperialism, especially Japanese imperialism, China was facing the danger of national subjugation; on the other hand, under the reactionary rule of the feudal warlords, wars continued year after year, and the people were living in misery. Where was the way out for China? This was a question that urgently needed to be answered at the time.

Since the Opium War, the Chinese people had waged many struggles for the independence and prosperity of their nation, advancing wave upon wave, undaunted by setbacks. However, these struggles failed time and time again.

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, led by Hong Xiuquan, lasted for fourteen years, striking at the domestic Qing Dynasty feudal rulers and foreign invaders. However, this revolution ultimately failed under the suppression of internal and external reactionaries. The Reform Movement led by Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and others reflected the desire of upper-class intellectuals who did not want to see the country perish to "strengthen the country through reform," which had its progressive effect at the time. However, the "reform" only lasted for one hundred and three days, and the result was also a failure. The Xinhai Revolution, led by Sun Yat-sen, once overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established a bourgeois democratic republic, which was a great achievement. However, this revolution was soon usurped by Yuan Shikai, the leader of the feudal warlords. Although Sun Yat-sen was still persistently continuing the revolution, he did not achieve any results due to the lack of correct direction and methods.

The peasant revolution failed, reformism did not work, and the bourgeois revolution did not succeed. Where was the way out for China? The Chinese people had not yet found the answer, and the great pioneer of the Chinese democratic revolution, Sun Yat-sen, was at a crossroads of hesitation.

It must be pointed out that on the eve of the October Revolution, a new class force had already formed. Due to changes in China's economic situation during World War I, the Chinese working class grew stronger and stronger and carried out heroic struggles. It must also be pointed out that the New Culture Movement, which promoted the awakening of the people, marked by the founding of the "Youth" ("New Youth") magazine in 1915, was also gradually unfolding.

However, the struggle of the working class on the eve of the October Revolution was still in a spontaneous state. They only participated in the revolution as followers of the bourgeoisie. The working class in the Xinhai Revolution was like this. In November 1916, the political strike of workers in the French Concession of Tianjin against French imperialism's occupation of Laoxikai showed the noble qualities and fighting power of the Chinese working class, but that struggle still did not get rid of the leadership and influence of the bourgeoisie, and the working class still did not step onto the political stage as a conscious and independent class force. At that time, the workers' mass organizations that appeared in Chinese society still had feudal or bourgeois characteristics. The "Chinese Labor Party," which once appeared in 1912 and was revived in 1916, openly revealed its purpose as: "to connect the feelings of the labor circles throughout the country and to cooperate with capitalists to increase the welfare of workers." ("Republic of China Daily," Shanghai, February 20, 1917)

The New Culture Movement at that time was still bourgeois democratic in nature. "New Youth" repeatedly called for learning from the French Revolution. "New Youth" raised the two banners of "democracy" and "science" and made a powerful impact on feudal culture and ideology, establishing great achievements, but they did very little in actual political struggles. The magazine openly declared in its inaugural issue: "Criticizing current politics is not its purpose." ("Youth" magazine, Volume 1, Issue 1) Cultural struggle without combining with political struggle could not exert its due combat effectiveness.

It can be seen that on the eve of the October Revolution, the Chinese revolution was under the leadership and influence of the bourgeoisie and was still of the nature of the old democratic revolution. As everyone knows, the times had already presented an immutable historical law: the old democratic revolution was not feasible in China. The old road was impassable, what should the new one be? Everyone was still ignorant. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to describe Chinese society on the eve of the October Revolution as being in a situation of "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and you doubt there is no road." However, it was at this time that the great October Socialist Revolution broke out in a neighboring country in northern China that occupied one-sixth of the world's land. This revolution opened a new era in world history and had great and immeasurable world significance. It was this revolution that brought the Chinese revolution from the point of "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted" to the realm of "suddenly a village appears, bright flowers and thick willows."

The news of the October Revolution quickly spread to China. On November 10, 1917, the "Republic of China Daily" reported the news of this revolution under the title "Sudden Russian Coup." Although the news of the October Revolution quickly spread to China, the Chinese people's understanding of the October Revolution went through a process:

From not understanding to understanding, from a few people understanding to most people understanding, from a one-sided understanding to a comprehensive understanding. The following three different views on the October Revolution roughly reflect this process.

First, looking at the October Revolution from the standpoint of the ruling class. At that time, most of the news came from the news agencies of imperialism, and the imperialists slandered the October Revolution. The Chinese ruling class at that time agreed with the views of the imperialists, and they viewed the October Revolution with hostility and fear. In the early days of the October Revolution, the Chinese democratic class was also influenced by this view of the ruling class. For example, the "Republic of China Daily" at that time also called the Bolsheviks "extremists," and directly described the Russian political situation, which was unclear in its judgment, as "a chaotic mess." ("Republic of China Daily," November 21, 1917).

Second, the truth cannot be covered up. Even from the intricate and chaotic news from foreign news agencies, the righteous nature of the Russian Revolution could not be denied. On New Year's Day in 1918, the "Republic of China Daily" editorial took a sympathetic view of the Russian Revolution. The editorial said: "We cannot help but hope for this great reform of our neighbor." The editorial further said: "What are the demands of the Russian Revolution? It is human rights; it is civil rights. Because we are fighting for human rights, we must improve the lives of peasants and workers; because we are fighting for civil rights, we must abolish the tyrannical royal family and aristocracy and build a democratic government. The revolutionary demands of our country are also the same... It is to build a democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People, so that all ethnic groups and classes in the country are equal, and the legal personality of individuals is respected. In other words, to seek the expansion of human rights and civil rights, to seek the realization of the spirit of equality and freedom, and to seek the permanent peace of our country." This kind of statement expressed a sympathetic attitude towards the October Revolution, which was commendable at the time. However, this kind of statement obviously viewed the October Revolution from the democratic point of view of Sun Yat-sen; it failed to recognize the profound essence of the October Revolution. Therefore, in the first few years after the October Revolution, although Sun Yat-sen expressed an extremely friendly attitude towards the October Revolution, he still failed to find the correct path for the development of the Chinese revolution from the October Revolution. In other words, the revolutionary forces he led and the struggles he carried out still did not get rid of the predicament of being at a crossroads.

Third, things are further developing. By July 1918, Li Dazhao's article "A Comparative View of the French and Russian Revolutions" was better able to see the profound essence of the October Revolution from the chaotic phenomena. This article pointed out in response to the chaotic views at the time: "We can only look forward to the dawn of a new world civilization in Russia today, and listen to the news of a new Russia built on the basis of free humanity, and seek to adapt to this new trend in the world. Do not simply take its current temporary chaos as a pessimistic view." In November 1918, Li Dazhao also published "The Victory of the Common People" (his speech at the mass rally celebrating the victory of the European War in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing) and "The Victory of Bolshevism." With full enthusiasm, he praised the October Revolution and said: "The Russian Revolution is just a paulownia leaf that startles the world to autumn. Although the word Bolshevism was created by the Russians, its spirit is the spirit of common awakening in the hearts of all mankind in the twentieth century. Therefore, the victory of Bolshevism is the victory of the new spirit of common awakening in the hearts of all mankind in the twentieth century!" ("New Youth," Volume 5, Issue 5). He also said: "From now on, everywhere we see the flag of Bolshevism's victory. Everywhere we hear the sound of Bolshevism's triumphal song. The alarm bell of humanity has sounded! The dawn of freedom has appeared! Look at the future world, it must be a world of red flags!" (Ibid.). He also called on the Chinese people to advance along the road of the October Revolution. In January 1919, he said in his article "The New Era": "This dark China, this dead Beijing, also seems to have gained a line of dawn, like a small star in the deep night, illuminating the path of new life. We should take advantage of this line of light and strive to make a little contribution to human activity." ("Weekly Review," Issue 3). The above view of the October Revolution spread among advanced revolutionary intellectuals by the eve of the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919. This point can be fully proved from the reflections of progressive newspapers and magazines at that time and from the memories of advanced elements of the Chinese revolution. At that time, "Labor is Sacred" became a popular slogan, and various groups studying labor issues and social reform issues emerged one after another. Although the ideological schools accepted by these groups were extremely complex, the differentiation of the groups was not obvious at that time, and they were consistent in their tendency towards the October Revolution.

While Chinese revolutionary intellectuals cheered for the October Revolution, their illusions about Western imperialism also shattered. At that time, Chinese intellectual circles had a visceral pain about Japanese imperialism, which directly invaded China, but they did not clearly understand Western imperialism, especially American imperialism. When the Paris Peace Conference was held in January 1919, many people had illusions about the United States, hoping that it could uphold justice and give China support. However, the process of the Paris Peace Conference exposed the hypocrisy of American imperialism one by one. China not only failed to recover any rights from the conference, but instead made the shackles on its body even heavier. Facts speak louder than words, and Chinese revolutionary intellectuals who had illusions gradually woke up from the facts.

On the one hand, the Russian October Revolution illuminated the road for the Chinese people to move forward and gave new hope to China's national liberation; on the other hand, the face of imperialism was clearly exposed in front of the Chinese people. In this way, Chinese revolutionary intellectuals gradually and clearly realized that the Chinese revolution must take the road of the Russian October Revolution, and the road of Western bourgeois countries was no longer feasible.

The May Fourth Movement took place under these circumstances.

When we say the May Fourth Movement, we are by no means referring only to the movement on May 4th. The May Fourth Movement was a patriotic anti-imperialist movement and also a new cultural movement. It includes a long process before and after. If we divide it strictly by historical period, it is from the occurrence of the May 4th Movement in 1919 to the establishment of the Communist Party of China in July 1921. Looking at the content of the May Fourth Movement during this period, its most essential thing, or its greatest achievement, lies in promoting the combination of Marxism and the Chinese workers' movement. This combination was only formed under the call of the October Revolution.

As mentioned earlier, before the October Revolution, the Chinese people had not found the truth of saving the country and the people, nor had they found the correct path for the development of the Chinese revolution. The October Revolution brought Marxism, a universal truth applicable everywhere, to China, which enabled the advanced elements of China to observe the fate of their country with the proletarian worldview, and thus came to the correct conclusion of taking the road of the Russians.

The October Revolution sent Marxism to China, which at first only circulated among a very small number of advanced elements. With the outbreak of the May Fourth Patriotic Movement, the conclusion that the Chinese revolution must take the road of the Russians became more and more understood by a wider range of revolutionary intellectuals, and a Marxist ideological movement was formed in China. At the time of the outbreak of the May Fourth Patriotic Movement, "New Youth" published a special issue on Marxist research (Volume 6, Issue 5, May 1919). After that, "New Youth" gradually became a publication promoting Marxism. In addition to "New Youth," among the hundreds of newspapers and magazines that appeared in various places at that time, most of them were discussing the October Revolution and Marxism to varying degrees. The May Fourth Movement formed the first Marxist ideological movement in China, which is its most meaningful and meritorious achievement. To repeat, this ideological movement was only formed under the call of the October Revolution.

The spread of Marxism in China, like in other countries, also went through serious struggles. At that time, the struggle between Marxism and anti-Marxism was concentrated in three debates: (1) the struggle between Marxists and the Hu Shi faction on issues and doctrines; (2) the debate between Marxists and the politicians of the Research Department on the issue of socialism; (3) the struggle between Marxists and anarchists. These three struggles all ended with the victory of Marxism. The three struggles focused on solving three issues: First, do we need a doctrine? That is, do we need Marxism? The result of the debate was that it was necessary, and Marxism was indispensable to solving the problem; Second, do we need a political party? That is, do we need a political party of the working class? The result of the debate was that it was necessary, and China fully possessed the conditions for establishing a political party of the working class; Third, what kind of party do we need? Is it a Marxist party or an anarchist party? The result of the debate was that it was necessary to establish a Marxist party, and the political party of the Chinese working class must be established according to the example of the Russian Bolshevik Party.

After the above struggles, the Chinese workers' movement gradually combined with Marxism. In July 1921, the Communist Party of China was formally established. The establishment of the Communist Party of China made the face of the Chinese revolution焕然一新.

The influence of the Russian October Revolution on the Chinese revolution was extremely great and extremely profound. To sum it up, it promoted the birth of the Communist Party of China. Since then, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, under the shining light of the October Revolution and with the help of the Soviet Union, the Chinese revolution has achieved one great victory after another - not only the great victory of the new democratic revolution, but also the great victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The above is specifically about the call and great significance of the October Revolution to the May Fourth Movement and the Chinese revolution. However, the relationship of internationalist friendship is not only a one-sided relationship of support, but also a close and inseparable relationship of mutual support. The characteristics of this relationship began to be reflected in the May Fourth Movement. Here, only one fact of the joint struggle of Chinese and Russian workers can show how close the relationship between the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement was.

In July 1919, shortly after the "June 3rd" Movement, a general strike began on the entire Chinese Eastern Railway. Russian workers and Chinese workers working on this railway participated in this struggle together. Russian workers called on Chinese workers and said: "You should, like us, elect strike committees and take joint action with us on all issues of this strike... In short, forget that we are different nationalities, let us unite completely and act together firmly and unswervingly for our common cause and our common interests!" (Archives of the Soviet State Central Archives of the October Revolution and Socialist Construction, Chinese excerpt "The Great October and the People of Eastern Countries," Sanlian Bookstore, December 1958, p. 58). A leaflet circulating in the Chinese workers' struggle said: "Our country has been almost completely occupied by the Japanese. The Peace Conference has decided to completely cede the entire Shandong Province to Japan. Millions of Shandong people will be reduced to Japanese slaves. If we Chinese people cannot rise up to defend ourselves and avoid becoming Japanese slaves, then what face do we have to see our brothers." This leaflet called on Chinese workers to actively participate in the strike of Russian workers, and at the end of the leaflet shouted "Long live the great unity of Chinese workers and Russian workers! Oppose Japanese aggression!" (Ibid., p. 59).

The above two documents show that the strike on the Chinese Eastern Railway, from the strike of Russian workers, was a struggle to directly defend the October Revolution and also a support for the Chinese May Fourth Movement; from the Chinese workers, it was a part of the May Fourth Movement and also a support for the October Revolution. This strike was very effective, and it strongly supported the Red Army's attack on the White Bandit Army.

In summary, the May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the October Revolution. From the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, the people of China and the Soviet Union have formed a close and inseparable friendship. Over the past forty years, the great victories achieved by the Chinese revolution and the great achievements achieved by Chinese construction have been inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union. From the beginning of the October Revolution, the Chinese revolution has become a part of the world proletarian revolution; with the continuous development of the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese revolution has gradually become a great part of the world revolution. On the occasion of commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, looking back on the past and facing today, we naturally think of: we must continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, strengthen the great and unbreakable unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and wage a resolute struggle against all divisive conspiracies and destructive activities of imperialists and revisionists.

    十月革命和五四运动
    彭明
      “山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”，这是伟大的十月社会主义革命前后中国人民寻找中国社会出路情况的很好的写照。鸦片战争后，中国逐步变成了半殖民地半封建社会。帝国主义和封建主义像两座大山压在中国人民的身上。辛亥革命后，袁世凯窃国，对内进行残暴统治，积极恢复帝制；对外彻底投靠帝国主义，拍卖中国主权。袁世凯死后，段祺瑞承继其衣钵，其卖国残民的手段和结果，和袁世凯相较，有过之而无不及。段祺瑞为了实现所谓武力统一，用各种名义积极向日本大借款，以此作为内战经费，日本则借此掌握了中国经济政治的支配权。
    一方面，在帝国主义、特别是日本帝国主义的疯狂侵略下，中国已面临着亡国的危险；另一方面，在封建军阀的反动统治下，战祸连年，民不聊生。中国的出路在哪里？这是当时迫切需要回答的问题。
    从鸦片战争以来，中国人民为了自己民族的独立和富强，曾经进行了许多斗争，前仆后继，百折不挠。但是，这些斗争一次次地都失败了。
    洪秀全领导的太平天国运动，坚持了十四年之久，打击了国内清朝封建统治者和外国侵略者。但是，这个革命最后还是在内外反动派的镇压下失败了。康有为、梁启超等领导的维新运动，反映了不愿亡国的上层知识分子的
  “变法图强”的要求，在当时有着它的进步作用。但是，“变法”仅仅实行了一百零三天，结果也失败了。孙中山领导的辛亥革命，曾经推翻了清王朝，建立了资产阶级的民主共和国，有着很大的功绩。但是，不久这个革命就为封建军阀的首领袁世凯所篡夺。孙中山虽然仍在坚持不懈地继续革命，但是由于缺乏正确的方向和方法，并没有收到什么效果。
    农民革命失败了，改良主义走不通，资产阶级革命也没有成功。中国的出路在哪里？中国人民还没有找到答案，伟大的中国民主革命先行者——孙中山正处在彷徨的歧途中。
    必须指出，在十月革命前夕，新的阶级力量已经形成了。由于第一次世界大战期间中国经济状况的变化，中国工人阶级日益成长起来并且进行了英勇的斗争。也必须指出，促使人民觉醒的新文化运动，以1915年“青年”（“新青年”）杂志的创办为标志，也逐步开展起来了。
    但是，工人阶级的斗争在十月革命前夕仍处在自发的状态中，他们只是作为资产阶级的追随者参加了革命。如辛亥革命中的工人阶级，就是这样。1916年11月间，天津法租界工人为反对法帝国主义侵占老西开的政治大罢工，显示了中国工人阶级的高贵品质和战斗力量，但是那次斗争仍然没有摆脱资产阶级的领导和影响，工人阶级仍然没有作为一个觉悟了的独立的阶级力量登上政治舞台。当时在中国社会上出现的工人群众的组织，仍然是带有封建色彩或者是资产阶级性质的。1912年一度出现、1916年再度复活的“中华工党”，公开揭示自己的宗旨是：“为全国工界联络感情，并与资本家相提携，以增进工人之福利。”（上海
  “民国日报”，1917年2月20日）
    当时的新文化运动也仍然是资产阶级民主主义性质的，“新青年”曾一再号召向法兰西革命学习。“新青年”举起“民主”和“科学”两面大旗，向封建文化思想做了有力的冲击，建立了很大的功绩，但是他们在实际政治斗争中却做得很少。这个杂志在创刊号上竟然公开宣称：“批评时政，非其旨也。”（“青年”杂志第一卷第一号）文化斗争不和政治斗争相结合，也就不能发挥出应有的战斗力。
    由此可见，在十月革命前夕，中国革命是处在资产阶级的领导和影响下，仍是旧民主主义革命的性质。如大家所知，时代已经呈现了不可更移的历史规律：旧民主主义革命在中国是行不通的。旧的道路走不通，新的应该是什么？大家还茫然无知。因此，把十月革命前夕的中国社会，描述为“山穷水尽疑无路”的情况，是不过分的。但是，也正是在这时，在中国北方的一个占有世界六分之一土地的邻国中，爆发了伟大的十月社会主义革命。这个革命开辟了世界历史的新纪元，有着伟大的无可估量的世界意义。就是这个革命，把中国革命由“山穷水尽”的地步，带入了“柳暗花明又一村”的境界。
    十月革命的消息很快就传到了中国。1917年11月10日，“民国日报”即以“突如其来的俄国政变”为题报道了这一革命的消息。十月革命的消息虽然很快就传到中国来了，但是中
  国人民对十月革命的理解却经过了一个过程：
  从不认识到认识，从少数人认识到多数人认识，从片面的认识到全面的认识。下面三种对十月革命的不同看法，大致反映了这一过程。
    第一，站在统治阶级的立场去看十月革命。当时的消息大都来自帝国主义的通讯社，帝国主义者则对十月革命进行诬蔑。当时的中国统治阶级是和帝国主义的看法一致的，他们以敌对和恐惧的心情来看十月革命。在十月革命的最初的日子里，中国的民主阶级也曾受到这种统治阶级看法的影响。如当时的“民国日报”也称布尔什维克为“极端派”，对于判断不清之俄国政局则直书之为“一塌糊涂之乱状”（“民国日报”1917年11月21日）。
    第二，真相是掩盖不了的，即使从外国通讯社的错综纷乱的消息中，也不能不透露出俄国革命的正义性质。1918年元旦，“民国日报”的社论便对俄国革命抱有了同情的看法，这篇社论说：“吾人对于此近邻之大改革，不胜其希望也。”社论进一步说：“俄国革命之要求惟何？曰人权；曰民权。惟争人权也，故非达农民工民生活之改善不可；惟争民权也，故非革除专横之王家及贵族而建设民主政治不可。吾国之革命要求亦然也……曰建设以三民主义为基础之民主国家，使国内之各民族各阶级举为平等，而个人之法律上人格皆为尊重。换言之，求人权及民权之伸张也，求平等自由精神之实现也，求吾国之永久和平也。”这种言论对十月革命表示了同情的态度，在当时是难能可贵的。但是，这种言论显然是以孙中山的民主主义观点来看十月革命的；它对十月革命的深刻本质，还未能有所认识。因此，在十月革命后的最初几年里，虽然孙中山对十月革命表示了极其友好的态度，但是他还未能从十月革命中找出中国革命正确发展的道路。也就是说，他所领导的革命力量及其进行的斗争，仍然没有摆脱处于歧途中的困境。
    第三，事物是进一步发展的，到了1918年7月李大钊发表的“法俄革命之比较观”一文，就比较能够从纷乱的现象中看出十月革命的深刻本质了。这篇文章针对当时的混乱看法指出：“吾人对于俄罗斯今日之事变，惟有翘首以迎其世界的新文明之曙光，倾耳以迎其建于自由人道上之新俄罗斯之消息，而求所以适应此世界的新潮流，勿徒以其目前一时之乱象遂遽为之抱悲观也。”1918年11月，李大钊又同时发表了“庶民的胜利”（他在北京天安门前庆祝欧战胜利的群众纪念会上的演说）、“布尔什维主义的胜利”等文。他以满腔的热情歌颂十月革命说：“俄国的革命，不过是使天下惊秋的一片桐叶罢了。布尔什维主义这个字，虽为俄人所创造；但是他的精神，可是二十世纪全世界人类人人心中共同觉悟的精神。所以布尔什维主义的胜利，就是二十世纪世界人类人人心中共同觉悟的新精神的胜利！”（“新青年”第五卷第五号）又说：“由今以后，到处所见的，都是布尔什维主义战胜的旗。到处所闻的，都是布尔什维主义的凯歌的声。人道的警钟响了！自由的曙光现了！试看将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界！”（同上）他还号召中国人民沿着十月革命的道路前进。1919年1月，他在“新纪元”一文中说：“这黑暗的中国，死寂的北京，也仿佛分得那曙光的一线，如比在沉沉深夜中得一个小小的明星，照见新人生的道路。我们应该趁着这一线的光明，努力前去为人类活动作出一点有益人类工作。”（“每周评论”第三号）上述这种对十月革命的看法，到1919年“五四”前夕，在先进的革命知识分子中就传播开来了。这一点，从当时进步报刊的反映中，从中国革命先进分子的回忆中，都可以得到充分的证明。当时，“劳工神圣”成为风行一时的口号，研究劳工问题和社会改造问题的各种团体也纷纷出现。这些团体接受的思想流派虽然极其复杂，但是那时各团体的分化尚不明显，倾向十月革命是一致的。
    和中国革命知识分子欢呼十月革命的同时，他们对西方帝国主义的幻想也破灭了。当时中国知识界对直接侵略中国的日本帝国主义是有切肤之痛的，但是他们对西方帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义则认识不清。1919年1月巴黎和会召开，不少人对美国抱有幻想，希图它能主持公道，给中国以支持。但是，巴黎和会的过程，把美帝国主义的伪善面目一一揭穿了，中国从和会中不仅未收回任何权益，反而使自己身上的枷锁更加沉重了。事实胜于雄辩，抱有幻想的中国革命知识分子从事实中逐步清醒了。
    一方面，俄国十月革命照耀着中国人民前进的道路，给了中国民族解放以新希望；另一方面，帝国主义的面目在中国人民面前暴露得已很明显。这样，中国革命知识分子就逐步明确地认识到：中国革命非走俄国十月革命的道路不可，而西方资产阶级国家的道路已是行不通了。
    五四运动就是在这种情况下发生的。
    我们说五四运动，绝不是仅仅指5月4日这一天的运动而言的。五四运动是一个爱国反帝运动，又是一个新文化运动。它的前后包括着一个长期的过程。如果以严格的历史分期来说，它是从1919年5月运动的发生到1921年7月中国共产党的成立。就这一段时期的五四运动的内容来看，它的最本质的东西，或者说它的最大的功绩，就在于促成了马克思主义和中国工人运动的结合。这一结合也只是在十月革命的号召下才形成的。
    如前所述，在十月革命以前，中国人并没有找到救国救民的真理，没有找到中国革命正确发展的道路。十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思主义这一放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，才使中国的先进分子用无产阶级的宇宙观观察自己国家的命运，从而得出走俄国人的路的正确结论。
    十月革命送来了马克思主义，在开始时只是在极少数的先进分子中流传着。随着五四爱国运动的爆发，中国革命必须走俄国人的路这一结论愈来愈为更广大的革命知识分子所了解，一次马克思主义的思想运动就在中国形成了。在五四爱国运动爆发的时候，“新青年”出版了马克思研究专号（第六卷第五号，1919年5月）。此后，“新青年”便逐步成为一个宣传马克思主义的刊物。除“新青年”外，当时在各地出现的数百种报刊中，大都在不同程度上对十月革命和马克思主义进行着讨论。五四运动形成为在中国的第一次马克思主义的思想运动，这也就是它的最有意义和最有功绩的所在。再重复一句，这一思想运动只是在十月革命的号召下才形成的。
    马克思主义在中国的传播，和在其他国家一样，也是经过了严重的斗争的。当时，马克思主义和反马克思主义的斗争，曾集中在这样三次论战上：（一）马克思主义者和胡适派关于问题和主义的斗争；（二）马克思主义者和研究系政客关于社会主义问题的论争；（三）马克思主义者和无政府主义者的斗争。这三次斗争都是以马克思主义的胜利而告终的，三次斗争集中地解决了这样三个问题：第一，要不要主义？即要不要马克思主义？论争的结果是，必需要，解决问题离不开马克思主义；第二，要不要政党？即要不要工人阶级的政党？论争的结果是，必需要，中国完全具备成立工人阶级政党的条件；第三，要什么样的党？是马克思主义的党，还是无政府主义的党？论争的结果是，必需建立马克思主义的党，中国工人阶级的政党必需按照俄国布尔什维克党的榜样建立起来。
    经过上述各项斗争后，中国工人运动就和马克思主义逐步结合起来了。1921年7月，中国共产党正式成立。中国共产党的成立，就使中国革命的面貌焕然一新。
    俄国十月革命对中国革命的影响是极其伟大和极其深刻的，集中到一点来说，这就是促成了中国共产党的诞生。从此以后，中国革命在中国共产党的领导下，在十月革命的光辉照耀和苏联的帮助下，取得了一次又一次的伟大胜利，——不仅取得了新民主主义革命的伟大胜利，而且取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。
    以上是专就十月革命对五四运动和中国革命的号召及其伟大意义而谈的。但是，国际主义的友谊关系，不仅是单方面的支援关系，而且是密切不可分割的相互支援的关系，这种关系的特点在五四运动中也开始反映出来了。在这里只举一件中俄工人联合斗争的事实，即可看出十月革命和五四运动的关系是多么地密切。
    1919年7月间，即在“六三”运动刚刚发生后不久，中东路全线也开始了总罢工，在这个铁路上工作的俄国工人和中国工人一致参加
  了这一斗争。俄国工人号召中国工人说：“你们应当像我们一样，选举罢工委员会，在这次罢工的一切问题上同我们采取共同行动。……总之，忘掉我们是不同的民族，咱们完全团结无间，协力同心坚定不移地为我们的共同事业，为我们的共同利益而行动吧！”（苏联国立中央十月革命与社会主义建设档案馆档案，中文引见“伟大十月和东方各国人民”，三联书店1958年12月版，第58页）在中国工人斗争中流行的一张传单中说：“我们的国土几乎全部被日本人侵占。和会已经决定把整个山东省完全割让给日本。几百万的山东人将沦为日本人的奴隶。如果我们中国人自己不能起而自卫免作日本人的奴隶，那末我们还有何面目见我们的兄弟们。”这张传单号召中国工人积极参加俄国工人的罢工，并在传单的结尾高呼
  “中国工人和俄国工人的大联合万岁！反对日本侵略！”（同上书，第59页）
    以上两个文件表明：这次中东路的罢工，从俄国工人的罢工说来，它是直接保卫十月革命的斗争，同时也是对中国五四运动的支援；从中国工人说来，它是五四运动的一部分，同时也是对十月革命的一种支援。这次罢工极有成效，它有力地支援了红军对白匪军的进攻。
    综上所述，五四运动是在十月革命的号召下发生的。从十月革命和五四运动开始，中苏两国人民便结成了密切的不可分割的友谊关系。四十年来，中国革命所取得的伟大胜利和中国建设所取得的伟大成就，也都是和苏联的援助分不开的。从十月革命开始，中国革命就已经成为无产阶级世界革命的一部分；随着中国革命胜利的不断发展，中国革命又逐步成为世界革命的伟大的一部分。值此纪念五四运动四十周年之际，回顾已往，面对今天，我们就很自然地想到：必须继续发扬十月革命和五四运动的光辉传统，加强中苏两国人民的伟大的牢不可破的团结，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，和帝国主义者及修正主义者的一切分裂阴谋和破坏活动进行坚决的斗争。
