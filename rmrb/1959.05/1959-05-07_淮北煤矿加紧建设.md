　　Huaibei Coal Mine Speeds Up Construction

　　(Our report) A new coal industry base, the Huaibei Coal Mine, is being rapidly built on the Zhahe Plain in Huaibei, covering 250 square kilometers.

　　This vast coalfield is estimated by exploration to have coal reserves of approximately 1.2 billion tons, with recoverable reserves of about 800 million tons. Since the second half of last year, the Huaibei Coal Mine has launched a large-scale construction program. This year, a total of thirteen pairs of new and continuing mine shafts are under construction, with an annual designed production capacity of six million tons. The vast number of construction workers are vigorously engaged in technical innovations, doing everything possible to quickly pass through the topsoil layer, quickly sink the shafts, quickly open the roadways, quickly install the equipment, quickly hand over to production, and quickly produce coal. They are striving to have five pairs of mine shafts handed over for production this year, and to guarantee a coal output of 500,000 tons this year. Currently, the Lieshan Mine incline shaft, with a designed annual production capacity of 210,000 tons, has been officially put into production for extraction.

　　淮北煤矿加紧建设
    本报讯　在二百五十平方里的淮北闸河平原上，一个新的煤炭工业基地——淮北煤矿，正在飞快地兴建。
    这块广阔的煤田，经勘探估计储煤量约十二亿吨，可采量约八亿吨。从去年下半年起，淮北煤矿就揭开了大规模建设的序幕。今年续建和新建矿井共十三对，年设计产量六百万吨。建井的广大职工正在大搞技术革命，想尽一切办法，快过表土层，快打井筒，快开巷道，快安装设备，快移交生产，快出煤炭。他们力争五对矿井在今年内移交生产；保证今年出煤五十万吨。现在，设计年产量二十一万吨的烈山矿斜井已正式投入回采。
