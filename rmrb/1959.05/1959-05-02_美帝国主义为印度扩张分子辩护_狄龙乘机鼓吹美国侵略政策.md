Xinhua News Agency, May 1st, Washington: Some figures in the American ruling group continue to exploit the failed Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble.

    Yesterday, at a gathering of the International Economic and Social Development Association, Dillon, the US Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, again clamored about the so-called "threat of communist aggression," saying that "the crimes committed by the imperialist rulers of Communist China in Tibet clearly illustrate the reality of this communist threat." He falsely accused the Chinese government of "destroying" the Bandung Principles by suppressing a rebellion on its own territory, and slandered: "The Chinese Communists have destroyed the assurances they gave to the brave and deeply religious people of that remote and surrounded land (referring to Tibet) with such savage shamelessness."

    Dillon seized the opportunity to advocate for America's aggressive policies, saying that the Tibetan rebellion increased the "strategic value" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, this aggressive military bloc, and vigorously promoted the use of massive US "aid" to support this aggressive policy.

    The notorious schemer, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, also took advantage of the Tibetan rebellion yesterday to make wild remarks, saying that China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion was "irrational and misjudged," and a "suppression of Tibetan freedom." He also took the opportunity to sow discord between the Chinese and Indian people, saying that China's "talk about the situation in Tibet reveals a lack of concern for India's feelings."

    Yesterday, Mrs. Roosevelt published an article in the "Washington Post," falsely accusing China of not allowing the "Tibetan people" to have "freedom." She denied the facts of the collusion between imperialists and foreign reactionaries with Tibetan rebels, defended the Indian expansionists' interference in China's internal affairs, but could not produce any facts, and only insisted that neither India nor other countries had "interfered in China's internal affairs," and no one had "incited rebellion." She even talked nonsense, saying that the rebellion was caused by Tibet not getting "freedom."

    Mrs. Roosevelt also attempted to use the Tibetan rebellion to provoke relations between China and Asian and African countries, and tried to stir up an anti-communist wave. She said that the Tibet incident could "warn" Asia and Africa about the "true goals" of communist parties everywhere. She also said: "Unless the communists abandon their avowed intention of conquering the world by any means, there is not much chance of resolving the issues of disarmament and peaceful coexistence."

    美帝国主义为印度扩张分子辩护
    狄龙乘机鼓吹美国侵略政策
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团中的一些人物继续利用失败了的西藏叛乱事件兴风作浪。
    美国负责经济事务的副国务卿狄龙昨天在国际经济与社会发展协会的一次集会上又大叫所谓“共产主义侵略的威胁”，说什么“共产党中国的帝国主义统治者对西藏所犯的罪十分清楚地说明了这种共产主义威胁的现实性”。他诬蔑中国政府在自己国土上平定叛乱是“破坏”了万隆原则，并且污蔑说：“中国共产党人竟以那样野蛮的无耻态度破坏了他们向那个僻远而被包围的国土（指西藏）的英勇的、宗教信仰很深的人民所作出的保证。”
    狄龙乘机鼓吹美国的侵略政策，说什么西藏叛乱提高了东南亚条约组织这一侵略性军事集团的“战略价值”，并且竭力鼓吹用大量美“援”支持这种侵略政策。
    臭名远扬的阴谋家美国副国务卿帮办墨菲昨天也借西藏叛乱大放厥词，说什么中国平定西藏叛乱是
  “没有理性的和判断错误”，是“对西藏的自由的镇压”。他还乘机挑拨中印两国人民之间的友谊，说什么中国“关于西藏局势的谈话透露了对印度的感情缺乏关心”。
    罗斯福夫人昨天在“华盛顿邮报”上发表文章，诬蔑中国不允许“西藏人民”有“自由”。她抵赖帝国主义和外国反动派和西藏叛乱分子相勾结的事实，为印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政辩解，却举不出任何事实，只是一味强辩说，不论是印度还是其他国家都没有“插手中国的内政”，没有人“煽动叛乱”。她甚至信口雌黄，说叛乱是由于西藏得不到“自由”而引起的。
    罗斯福夫人还企图利用西藏叛乱挑拨中国同亚洲和非洲国家的关系，力图煽起反共浪潮。她说，西藏事件可以“警告”亚洲和非洲关于各地共产党的“真正目的”。她还说：“除非共产党人放弃他们所宣称的要不择手段地征服全世界的意图，否则就没有多大机会来解决裁军和和平共处的问题。”
