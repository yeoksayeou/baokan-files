Xinhua News Agency, May 9th. The documentary film "Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion" has been completed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and will be screened in twelve cinemas in Beijing starting from May 10th, and will be gradually released throughout the country.

The film mostly records the course of the Tibetan rebellion. Among them is the chaotic situation in Lhasa during the first few days of the rebellion on March 10th: a group of thieving and sinister rebel leaders posted so-called "Tibetan Independence Country" "recruitment orders" and other reactionary proclamations on the streets. The rebels used the Potala Palace and Chakpori Hill as positions to attack the people. Machine gun nests and shooting bunkers were everywhere. Even the Norbulingka, where the Dalai Lama resided, was surrounded by trenches and bunkers.

The cameramen recorded the rebels' heinous crimes. The Lhasa Mosque and many institutions were burned by the rebels, leaving only the bare walls, not a single tile remained; many houses were looted; national defense highways and bridges were cut off; the rebels beat to death and wounded People's Liberation Army soldiers and Tibetan compatriots and Tibetan officials who refused to participate in the rebellion; Gedar, a Tibetan youth who reported the rebels' situation to the People's Liberation Army, had his eyes gouged out by the rebels. The rebels even brazenly surrounded the CPC Tibet Work Committee and the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region. Only some defensive barbed wire was set up in front of the solemn CPC Tibet Work Committee Building, and no one retaliated against the rebels' crazy provocations. The cameramen sometimes had to risk their lives to film many scenes in the film. Cameraman Li Zhenyu said that the fairy tale that the People's Liberation Army fired two or three shots at the Norbulingka or the pond first on March 17th was a complete fabrication.

On the night of March 19th, the rebels finally ignited the flames of war throughout Lhasa. On the morning of March 20th, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack. Smoke filled the screen as the soldiers bravely charged towards these man-eating "jackals". The once arrogant rebels quickly turned into prisoners kneeling on the ground. Those "Daibens" and "Deputy Commanders" with fierce eyes also had to raise their blood-stained hands. Some prisoners were even wearing British uniforms, and various foreign weapons were seized.

The film also exposes many long-planned secret telegrams and other evidence seized in the counter-insurgency battles, many documents of conspiracy and rebellion, and a large number of guns, ammunition, and plain clothes prepared by reactionary lamas to wear during the war, which were searched from under the Buddha statues in Drepung Monastery and Muru Monastery.

The screen finally showed a peaceful scene after the rebellion was quelled: monks and laypeople quickly repaired the corners of the Jokhang Temple that had been damaged by the war; farmers in the suburbs of Lhasa cultivated for themselves for the first time in thousands of years; and the people of the city held a grand meeting to celebrate the victory of the suppression of the rebellion and held demonstrations against foreign interventionists.

### 看，西藏叛匪祸国殃民的罪行！纪录影片“平息西藏叛乱”今起在北京上映

　　看，西藏叛匪祸国殃民的罪行！
　　纪录影片“平息西藏叛乱”今起在北京上映
    新华社9日讯　纪录影片“平息西藏叛乱”已经由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制完成，从5月10日起在北京十二家影院上映，并将陆续在全国各地上映。
    影片大部分纪录了西藏叛乱经过。其中有3月10日叛乱发动头几天拉萨的混乱局面：一批贼头鬼脑的叛匪在街头张贴所谓“西藏独立国”的“征兵令”和其他反动文告。叛匪们把布达拉宫和药王山当作进攻人民的阵地，机关枪眼和射击掩体触目皆是。连达赖喇嘛居住的罗布林卡周围也布满了战壕和地堡。
    摄影师纪录下了叛匪们令人发指的罪行。拉萨清真寺和许多机关被叛匪烧得仅存四壁、片瓦不留，许多民房被打劫一空，国防公路和桥梁被切断，叛匪打死打伤了人民解放军战士和不肯参加叛乱的藏胞和藏族官员，向人民解放军报告叛匪情况的藏族青年格达被叛匪挖去了双眼。叛匪甚至悍然包围了中共西藏工作委员会和人民解放军西藏军区，庄严的中共西藏工委大厦前仅仅设有一些防御性的铁丝网，没有人对叛匪的疯狂挑衅给以还击。摄影师们有时不得不冒着生命危险去拍摄影片中的许多现场情景。摄影师李振羽说，所谓人民解放军在3月17日先向罗布林卡或池塘打了两三炮的童话根本是捏造。
    3月19日夜叛匪终于在拉萨全城燃起了战火。3月20日上午人民解放军出击了。银幕上硝烟弥漫，战士们英勇冲向这些吃人的“豺狼”，嚣张一时的叛匪很快地变成了跪在地上的俘虏，那些满眼凶光的“代本”、“副司令”也都不得不举起他们沾满血污的双手，有些俘虏还穿着英国军装，各式各样的外国武器被缴了下来。
    影片中还揭露了在平叛战斗中缴获的许多蓄谋已久的密电和其他罪证，许多阴谋叛乱的证件，以及从哲蚌寺和墨汝寺的佛像下搜查出的大量枪枝、弹药和反动喇嘛准备在打仗时穿的便衣。
    银幕上最后出现了叛乱平定后的一派和平景象：僧俗人民迅速修缮被战火毁损了的大昭寺楼角；拉萨市郊农民千百年来第一次为自己而耕种；全城人民举行大会庆祝平叛胜利，游行示威反对外国干涉者。
