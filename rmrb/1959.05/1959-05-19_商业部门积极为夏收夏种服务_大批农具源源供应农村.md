Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Commercial departments are actively organizing farm tools for the summer harvest and planting, which are steadily being supplied to people's communes in various regions.

This year, commercial departments in various regions have arranged the production of tools for the summer harvest and planting earlier than in previous years. Since the beginning of spring, while ensuring the supply of production materials for spring plowing, commercial departments in various regions have begun to prepare tools for the summer harvest and planting. In many areas, industrial, agricultural, and commercial departments, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, held coordination meetings, signed contracts, and arranged for the production of small farm tools. Commercial departments in various areas of Henan Province organized manpower to investigate the production, supply, and demand of small farm tools for the summer harvest and planting, and then organized the source of goods. Now, more than 33.6 million pieces have been prepared, accounting for 74% of the required amount. Currently, 85% of the farm tools needed for the summer harvest and planting in rural areas of Shaanxi Province have been prepared. The newly added summer harvest tools such as sickles in Jiangsu Province are equivalent to half of the total number of original summer harvest tools.

This year, wheat is generally growing strongly with dense stalks, and the workload of harvesting and threshing during the summer harvest will be very large. Commercial departments in various regions are working with relevant departments to actively help people's communes reform farm tools and summarize and promote some advanced tools that are easy to use and highly efficient. As of May 5, more than 1.96 million various advanced harvesting tools and more than 1.71 million threshing tools have been promoted nationwide. Shanxi Province recently held an on-site evaluation meeting for summer harvest tools, selecting 15 pieces from 150 summer harvest tools for promotion in the province according to local conditions. The main wheat-producing areas of this province—Wenxi, Jishan, Pinglu, Houma and other counties and cities in southern Shanxi—have recently reformed and promoted more than 500,000 various summer harvest tools. Various new-style harvesting farm tools manufactured in the Linyi Special Zone of Shandong Province, such as hand-cranked harvesters, threshing harvesters, new-style sickles, power harvesters, and threshers, have been tested and identified multiple times, and their working efficiency is one to ten times higher than that of old-fashioned tools.

There are still a large number of old farm tools in rural areas that can be used with slight repairs. Commercial departments actively assist people's communes in establishing fixed repair factories or mobile repair stations to repair these farm tools. Now, many places have basically achieved that every commune has a repair factory and every team has a repair station, so that major repairs of farm tools are done within the commune and minor repairs are done within the team. Commercial departments in some areas hold technical training classes to train maintenance personnel for the communes.

In the past month or so, many material exchange meetings held in various regions have organized the adjustment of small farm tools. For example, in addition to holding internal material exchange meetings within the commercial system, the Xuchang Special Zone of Henan Province also organized material exchanges between communes and communes, and between production brigades and production brigades. The entire region adjusted more than 180,000 pieces of farm tools such as scythes, sickles, and wheat shovels, basically achieving a balance of supply between regions.

### 商业部门积极为夏收夏种服务  大批农具源源供应农村

    商业部门积极为夏收夏种服务
    大批农具源源供应农村
    新华社17日讯　商业部门组织的夏收夏种农具，正在源源供应给各地人民公社。
    各地商业部门今年对夏收夏种工具的生产，安排得比往年都早。入春以来，各地商业部门在做好春耕生产资料供应的同时，就开始准备夏收夏种工具。许多地区的工业、农业、商业部门在党委统一领导下，召开了平衡协作会议，签订合同，安排小件农具的生产。河南省各地商业部门组织人力调查了夏收夏种小农具的产、供、需情况，然后组织货源，现在已准备好三千三百六十多万件，占需要量的74％。陕西省农村需要的夏收夏种农具，目前已准备好85％。江苏省新增加的镰刀等夏收工具，相当于原有夏收工具总数的一半。
    今年的小麦普遍长得苗壮株密，夏收期间收割和脱粒的工作量很大。各地商业部门正在同有关部门一起，积极帮助人民公社改革农具，总结与推广一些使用方便、效率高的先进工具。到5月5日为止，全国已推广各种较先进的收割工具一百九十六万多件、脱粒工具一百七十一万多件。山西省最近召开了夏收工具现场评比会议，从一百五十件夏收工具中评选出十五件，在本省因地制宜地推广。这个省的主要产麦区——晋南的闻喜、稷山、平陆、侯马等县、市，最近已改革推广各种夏收工具五十多万件。山东省临沂专区制造的各种新式收割农具如手摇收割机、脱粒收割机、新式镰刀、动力收割机和脱粒机等，经过多次试验鉴定，工作效率比旧式工具提高一倍到十倍。
    各地农村还有大量只要稍加修理就可以使用的旧农具。商业部门主动协助人民公社建立固定的修配厂或流动修配站，修理这些农具。现在，许多地方基本上做到了社社有修配厂，队队有修配站，农具大修不出社，小修不出队。有些地区的商业部门举办技术训练班，为公社培养检修人员。
    最近一个多月来，许多地区召开的物资交流会，都组织调剂了小农具。如河南许昌专区除召开商业系统内部的物资交流会以外，还组织公社与公社、生产大队与生产大队进行物资交流，全区共调剂了钐刀、镰刀、麦铲等农具十八万多件，基本上做到了地区之间供应平衡。
