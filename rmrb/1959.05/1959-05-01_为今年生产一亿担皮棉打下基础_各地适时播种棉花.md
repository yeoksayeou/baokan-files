To lay the foundation for producing 100 million dan of ginned cotton this year, various regions are sowing cotton in a timely manner.

(Reported by our newspaper) This year, cotton sowing is being carried out quickly and well. Most areas south of the Yellow River have basically completed cotton sowing, and over 60 million mu of cotton have been sown nationwide. Provinces such as Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Yunnan have basically completed their sowing plans. Cotton fields sown around the Qingming Festival have generally sprouted.

Seizing work efficiency and catching up with the season, grasping technology, and ensuring quality are prominent features of this year's cotton sowing work. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, strip seeding machines are commonly used for cotton sowing, resulting in uniform seed distribution and consistent depth, greatly improving sowing efficiency and quality compared to previous years. In areas with tractors, tractors are used to pull strip seeding machines to accelerate the sowing speed. In order to rapidly sow cotton, Turpan County in Xinjiang created and improved more than ten kinds of agricultural implements, including rope-drawn machines, subsoilers, and seeders. More than 80,000 mu of cotton fields throughout the county have been meticulously leveled, and more than 90% of the cotton fields have been applied with sufficient base fertilizer. According to the characteristics of cotton's need for light and wind, and the summer wind direction, Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province adopted cotton planting methods such as high ridges, north-south rows, wide-narrow rows, and "three incense sticks" (three small ridges and one large ridge). This allows the cotton seedlings to have a large sun exposure area and good ventilation, which is very beneficial to the growth and development of the cotton seedlings.

Some cotton-growing areas encountered rain or drought during the sowing period, which brought difficulties to sowing. However, the commune members demonstrated their enthusiasm, overcame difficulties, and successfully completed the sowing plan. Since entering April, Hubei Province has experienced continuous spring rain. In addition to seizing the gaps between rainfalls to rush-sow, various places also held forums with veteran farmers and technicians to summarize past rainy-day sowing experiences and experiment with rainy-day sowing. Some people's communes have also established "Three Guarantees" (guaranteeing full seedlings, guaranteeing complete seedlings, guaranteeing strong seedlings) command posts, and production teams have formed "Three Guarantees" combat groups. They adopted methods such as frequent soil loosening, deep ditching, adding covering materials, and applying warm fertilizer to prevent the cotton fields from crusting, waterlogging, and freezing due to rain.

In order to ensure full, complete, and strong seedlings, various places have focused on field management as soon as sowing ended. After cotton sowing, Renshou County in Sichuan Province launched a mass inspection and appraisal campaign throughout the county, checking whether the sowing plan was completed, how the technical specifications were implemented, and whether enough fertilizer was applied. After inspection and appraisal, it was confirmed that this year's sowing quality was better than any previous year, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and strengthened their confidence in winning high yields. At the same time, cotton fields that did not meet the technical specifications for sowing were also promptly remedied.

In order to ensure the realization of the production task of 100 million dan of ginned cotton, various places have not only paid attention to improving the yield per unit area this year, but also paid attention to appropriately expanding the cotton planting area. The cotton planting area in Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces will be about double that of last year. (Attached picture)

### 为今年生产一亿担皮棉打下基础  各地适时播种棉花

    为今年生产一亿担皮棉打下基础
    各地适时播种棉花
    本报讯　今年棉花种得又快又好，黄河以南大部地区已基本上完成种棉工作，全国已经种棉六千多万亩。河南、陕西、山西、云南等省都已基本完成播种计划。清明前后播种的棉田都已普遍出苗。
    抓工效、赶季节；抓技术，保质量，是今年棉花播种工作中的显著特点。陕西省关中地区普遍使用条播机种棉，下种均匀，深浅一致，播种效率和质量比往年大大提高。有拖拉机的地区，都用拖拉机牵引条播机播种，加快了播种速度。新疆的吐鲁番县为了迅速播种，全县共创造、改良了十几种农具，其中有绳索牵引机具、深耕器、播种机等。全县八万多亩棉田都经过精细平整，90％以上的棉田都施上了足够的底肥。河北省邯郸专区根据棉花生长需要光和风的特性和夏季的风向，采用了高垄、南北行、宽窄行和三柱香（三小垄一大垄）等种棉办法，这样，可使棉苗日照面大，通风好，十分有利于棉苗生长发育。
    有些棉区在播种期中碰上阴雨或干旱，给播种带来了困难，但是社员们发挥干劲，克服困难，都出色地完成了播种计划。湖北省进入4月以来，春雨连绵，各地除抓紧雨停间隙突击抢种外，又召开老农、技术员座谈会，总结过去雨天播种经验，试行雨天播种。有些人民公社还建立了“三保”（保齐苗、保全苗、保壮苗）指挥部，生产队成立“三保”战斗小组。他们采取勤松土、深开沟，加复盖物和追保温肥等办法，防止棉田因雨板结，受渍和受冻。
    为了保证苗全、苗齐、苗壮，各地在播种一结束就抓起了田间管理。四川省仁寿县在棉田下种后就在全县范围内掀起了群众性的检查评比运动，即查播种计划是否完成，查技术规格贯彻得怎样，查肥料施得够不够。经过检查评比，肯定了今年播种质量比任何一年都好，更加鼓舞了群众的干劲，坚定了夺取高产的信心；同时，对部分播种不够技术规格的棉田，也及时加以弥补。
    为了保证实现一亿担皮棉的生产任务，各地今年既注意了提高单位面积产量，也注意了适当扩大棉田面积。安徽、四川、云南、江西、浙江等省今年的植棉面积将比去年扩大一倍左右。（附图片）
