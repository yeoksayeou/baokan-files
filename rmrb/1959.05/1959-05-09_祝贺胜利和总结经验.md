　　Congratulations on Victory and Summarizing Experience
    Shenyang and Dalian, two industrial cities in Liaoning Province, have achieved new victories in manufacturing six key equipment projects in the first month of the decisive second quarter. Many sets of equipment have been delivered ahead of schedule, and many have completed or are undergoing assembly work ahead of schedule. Of the six equipment tasks undertaken by Shenyang, except for some parts of four rolling mills, power stations, and mines, other equipment has been completed ahead of schedule. For many factories, manufacturing six key equipment items is equivalent to manufacturing new products, and these equipment items, such as heavy rolling mills and power generation equipment, are very complex products. However, cadres, workers, and technicians in Shenyang and Dalian have overcome various difficulties and completed the manufacturing tasks of many equipment items in a shorter time than originally expected. We warmly congratulate the hundreds of thousands of workers in Shenyang and Dalian, together with the worker comrades in other cities across the country, for their outstanding contributions to the crash production of the six key equipment items urgently needed by the country. We also hope that you will continue to make further progress, give full play to your great wisdom and courage, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, and strive to create greater achievements in increasing production and practicing economy, so as to complete the six key equipment items ahead of schedule.
    We congratulate on victory, but we are not intoxicated by victory. We must summarize the experience of victory to create conditions for new victories.
    One common experience of Shenyang and Dalian in accelerating the progress of the recent crash production of six equipment items is: organizing city-wide large-scale cooperation and strengthening the organization of production. Other cities have had the same experience. This is an important experience, which is not only applicable to the manufacture of six key equipment items, but also to the entire industrial production, especially the production of the processing industry.
    Our industrial production has entered a new stage: we must not only manufacture various complex, large-scale, and precision single equipment items, but also manufacture complete sets of equipment. Producing complete sets of advanced, large-scale, and precision equipment is a sign of the increasing level of industrialization in our country. However, making equipment complete in a timely manner is not easy. Take a heavy rolling mill for example: it weighs more than a thousand tons, and has 60,000 different parts. Many other equipment items also have tens of thousands of parts and components. Therefore, no factory can independently complete all the matching tasks for each set of equipment within the specified production cycle. This requires collaboration. Therefore, one item of equipment is often produced in collaboration by dozens or hundreds of factories, and finally assembled into a complete set by the main manufacturing plant.
    If we only manufacture one rolling mill or one power generation equipment, and if there are no time restrictions on production, then collaboration may not be difficult. But we are engaged in large-scale industrial production, which is planned and proportional production. All products must complete plans in terms of quantity, quality, time, and sets. This is the advantage and characteristic of modern industrial production. Therefore, to collaborate well, we must carry out meticulous production organization work based on the combination of revolutionary drive and scientific analysis. From the perspective of a city, there should be strong command and scheduling to ensure that production proceeds in a planned and coordinated manner. From the perspective of a factory, while fully developing the creativity and initiative of the masses, we should constantly strengthen production management and technical management in accordance with the requirements of matching, and there should be various necessary and reasonable rules and regulations to ensure that production proceeds in an orderly and high-speed manner. Only in this way can we collaborate well, so that the equipment can be completed in a timely manner, delivered in a timely manner, installed well, and put into production, quickly increasing new production capacity.
    Shenyang and Dalian adopted the measures of city-wide large-scale collaboration and strengthening production organization in the production of six key equipment items, and as a result, the progress was greatly accelerated. The six equipment items are of a crash nature, but strengthening collaboration and strengthening production organization are necessary at any time in industrial production, and should be actively and proactively formulated in accordance with the objective laws of planned and proportional production, giving full play to the masses. Specific and effective measures. In this way, it is not only conducive to deepening the development of the increase production and practice economy movement, but also enables enterprise production to proceed in a planned and orderly manner, providing favorable conditions for completing the plan in terms of quantity, quality, time, and sets.
    We congratulate Shenyang and Dalian on their victory in manufacturing six key equipment items. We hope even more that all localities can further strengthen collaboration and strengthen the organization of industrial production in the increase production and practice economy movement, combine the enthusiasm of the broad masses with meticulous production organization work, and strive to create greater victories in the second quarter!

### 祝贺胜利和总结经验

　　祝贺胜利和总结经验
    辽宁省的沈阳和旅大两个工业城市，在决定性的第二季度的第一个月里，取得了制造六项重点设备的新胜利。许多设备已提前成套交货，许多设备已提前完成或提前进行组装工作。沈阳市担负的六项设备的任务，除四套轧钢机的部分部件、电站和矿山等部分设备外，其它都提前完成计划。对于许多工厂来说，制造六项重点设备，等于是制造新产品，而这些设备，如重型轧钢机、发电设备等，又都是很复杂的产品，可是沈阳和旅大的企业干部、工人和技术人员，征服了各种困难，并且在比原来预期还要短的时间内完成了许多设备的制造任务。我们热烈祝贺沈阳和旅大的几十万职工和全国其它城市的职工同志们一起，为突击制造国家急需的六项重点设备作了出色的贡献。并且希望你们百尺竿头，更进一步，继续发挥大智大勇，苦干实干巧干，为提前全部完成六项重点设备，创造更大的增产节约的成绩而奋斗。
    我们祝贺胜利，但我们并不沉醉在胜利中。我们要总结胜利的经验，为争取新的胜利创造条件。
    沈阳和旅大最近在突击制造六项设备中所以能加快进度，有一条共同的经验：组织全市的大协作和加强生产的组织工作。其它城市也有同样的经验。这是一个重要的经验，它不仅适用于六项重点设备的制造，而且适用于整个工业生产，特别是加工工业的生产。
    我们的工业生产，已经迈入一个新的阶段：不仅要制造各种复杂的、大型的、精密的单项设备，而且要制造成套的设备。成套地生产各种高级的、大型的、精密的成套设备，这是我国工业水平日益提高的标志。可是使设备及时地成套，并不是轻而易举的。以一台重型轧钢机来说，重量达一千多吨，各种部件有六万个。其它许多设备也都有成千上万的部件、零件。因此任何一个工厂都不可能单独地在规定的生产周期中来完成每套设备的全部配套任务。这就必须协作。因此一项设备，往往有几十个成百个工厂来协作生产，最后由主制厂配成套。
    如果我们只制造一台轧钢机或者一台发电设备，如果生产没有任何时间上的限制，那末，协作可能不是什么难事。而我们进行的是大规模的工业生产，是有计划的按比例的生产，各项产品都必须按量、按质、按期、按套完成计划。这是近代工业生产的优点和特点。因此，要协作得好，就必须进行细密的、建立在革命干劲和科学分析相结合的基础上的生产组织工作。从一个城市来说，应当有强有力的指挥和调度，使生产有计划地协调地进行。从一个工厂来说，应当在充分发扬群众的创造性积极性的同时，按照配套的要求不断加强生产管理、技术管理，并且要有各种必要的、合理的规章制度，来保证生产有秩序地高速度地进行。这样，才能协作得好，使设备及时成套、及时交货、及时安装好投入生产，迅速增加新的生产能力。
    沈阳和旅大在六项重点设备的生产中，采取了全市大协作和加强生产组织工作的措施，结果进度大为加快。六项设备是带有突击性的，但是加强协作和加强生产组织却是工业生产任何时候都必需的，而且应当按照有计划按比例的客观规律，充分发动群众，积极地、主动地订出具体的有效的措施。这样，既有利于深入开展增产节约运动，又能使企业生产有计划有秩序地进行，为按量、按质、按期、按套完成计划提供有利的条件。
    我们祝贺沈阳、旅大取得制造六项重点设备的胜利。我们更希望各地在增产节约运动中，都能进一步加强协作和加强工业生产的组织工作，把广大群众的积极性和细致的生产组织工作结合起来，争取在第二季度中创造更大的胜利！
