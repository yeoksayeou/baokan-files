Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Washington Dispatch: Some American bourgeois newspapers and political commentators have recently, in their commentaries on the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, admitted that the initiative at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is in the hands of the Soviet Union and that Western countries are passive everywhere. On the other hand, they advocate adhering to the West's stubborn policies.

    "New York Times" diplomatic correspondent Sulzberger, in a commentary from Geneva on the 12th, admitted that Western countries were forced to participate in the talks. He wrote: "We have finally been lured into a meeting. ... Even before this serious debate begins, we are in an uncomfortable situation." Sulzberger, referring to the participation of delegations from the two Germanys, wrote, "Diplomats may say that we are not dealing with East Germany, but in fact we are already dealing with East Germany."

    Sulzberger believes that what the West is seeking at the Geneva Conference is "the hope that the military and political status quo in Western Europe will be recognized, and that it will enjoy the right to change the status quo in Eastern Europe when it is in our (the West's) favor." He also said that the West does not want to give up "the only bridgehead inside socialist countries - West Berlin." Sulzberger also said, "In order to strengthen our negotiating position, we hope to maintain our three-to-one numerical advantage at the negotiating table, and not allow Soviet friends like Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate."

    Joseph Alsop, in an article published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 14th, spoke about the West Berlin issue in the tone of a "strength" policy advocate, saying: "On the one hand, ... maintaining the West's position in (West) Berlin is related to the West's vital interests. However, on the other hand, there is no way in the world to defend the West's important position in (West) Berlin unless it is prepared to fight for it." He advocated that the West use the threat of war at the Geneva Conference, saying that "only the clearest, most unequivocal and decisive expression of the West's will to fight for Berlin will lead to a compromise acceptable to the West." But he also worried that some of America's allies were unwilling to "fight for Berlin" and pointed out that the United States had lost its "nuclear leadership."

    David Lawrence wrote in an article published in the latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report": The Soviet Union "is dealing with the governments of Britain, the United States and France, but they are not a single whole. There are divisive influences at work in their own ranks."

### 在日内瓦会议上  西方处处被动步步为营  美国资产阶级政论家承认西方处境尴尬

    在日内瓦会议上
    西方处处被动步步为营
    美国资产阶级政论家承认西方处境尴尬
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国某些资产阶级报刊政论家最近在他们的关于日内瓦外长会议的评论中一方面承认，日内瓦外长会议上的主动权掌握在苏联手里，西方国家处处被动，另一方面又鼓吹坚持西方的顽固政策。
      “纽约时报”外交记者苏兹贝格在12日从日内瓦发出的一篇评论中承认西方国家是被迫参加这次会谈的，他写道：“我们终于被诱入一次会议。……甚至在这场认真的争论开始之前，我们就处于不舒服的境地”。苏兹贝格在谈到两个德国的代表团参加了会议时写道，“外交家们也许说我们并没有同东德打交道，但是事实上我们已经在同东德打交道了”。
    苏兹贝格认为，西方在日内瓦会议上所谋求的是“希望西欧的军事和政治现状得到承认，并且享有这样的权利：在有利于我们（西方）的情况下改变东欧现状”。他还说，西方不想放弃在社会主义国家“内部唯一的桥头堡——西柏林”。苏兹贝格还说，“为了加强我们的谈判地位，我们希望保持我们在谈判桌上三对一数量上的优势，而不让像波兰和捷克斯洛伐克那些苏联的朋友参加”。
    约瑟夫·艾尔索普在14日发表在“纽约先驱论坛报”上的一篇文章中谈到西柏林问题时以“实力”政策拥护者的语调说：“一方面，……保持西方在（西）柏林的地位是同西方切身利益有关的。然而，另一方面，世界上又没有任何办法能保卫西方在（西）柏林的这个重要地位，除非准备为它而战”。他主张西方在日内瓦会议上进行战争威胁，说什么“只有最清楚明白地、最明确果断地表示出西方为柏林而战的意志，才会促成西方可以接受的那种妥协办法”。但是他又担心美国的某些盟国不愿意“为柏林而战”，并且指出美国已经丧失了
  “核领导地位”。
    戴维·劳伦斯在发表在最新一期“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊上的一篇文章中写道：苏联“正在同英美法三国政府打交道，而它们却不是单一的整体。在它们自己的队伍里都有分裂性的影响在起作用。”
