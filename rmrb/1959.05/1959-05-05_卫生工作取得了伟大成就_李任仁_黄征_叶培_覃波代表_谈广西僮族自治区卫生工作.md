Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Premier Zhou summarized the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and pointed out the tasks for 1959, which greatly inspired us. We are fully confident in completing or overfulfilling this task. Now, I will present the development of health work in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, driven by the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, as follows:

Through rectification and anti-rightist struggles, under the glorious illumination of the socialist general line, our region's health work has achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in all aspects, including the establishment of health institutions, pest elimination and disease control, traditional Chinese medicine, technological innovation, hospital work, cadre training, people's commune health, and maternal and child health. This has safeguarded the health of the working people and vigorously supported and promoted production.

Since the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party put forward the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution, our region's health departments, like other regions in the country, have been focusing on pest elimination and disease control, working with soaring enthusiasm, breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and establishing a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. This has set off a high tide of technological revolution throughout the region, with new technological innovation projects emerging every day. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, and implementing the principles of combining mass movements with science and technology, integrating indigenous and foreign methods, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, integrating large, medium, and small scale approaches, and combining theory with practice and production, our region has achieved great achievements in science and technology and improving the quality of medical care. Under the call of "everyone contributes ideas, everyone thinks of solutions," the region has initially discovered more than 150 kinds of wild plants with good effects in killing mosquitoes, flies, and snails, such as camphor leaves and stemona leaves, which have played a significant role in pest elimination and disease control. *Rauwolfia verticillata*, used for treating hypertension, is estimated to be available in every county in our region, with abundant output. Recent clinical and pharmacological tests have initially proven that it has good effects. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has initially proven that it contains pure alkaloid "reserpine." If it can be put into production in the future, it can save a large amount of foreign exchange. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners treat leprosy in various ways in each county. According to the traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions from Cenxi, Pingnan, and Donglan counties alone, short-term application has initially found that most of the clinical symptoms disappear quickly, the leprosy reaction is very mild, and the leprosy bacilli begin to show fragmentation, and pathological sections have greatly improved. To draw conclusions, observations are still continuing. Guangxi has many poisonous snakes, and folk medicine has rich experience in treating poisonous snake bites. For example, herbal medicines like *Ophiorrhiza* have high efficacy. Fracture treatment is the specialty of folk herbal doctors, with various methods. Generally, they have a rapid effect on reducing swelling and relieving pain, and also have a certain effect on shortening the treatment time. Recently, the application of sugar cane instead of willow branches for bone setting has initially achieved success in animal experiments. Making full use of traditional Chinese and herbal medicine to treat diarrhea, dysentery, and influenza, materials were obtained locally, refined locally, and applied locally on construction, water conservancy, and steel construction sites, which played a certain role in prevention and treatment, and powerfully guaranteed the large-scale construction and the production of steel. Using acupuncture for pain relief instead of anesthesia to treat appendicitis and other diseases has been effective and widely welcomed by the masses. Before liberation, county-level hospitals in our region had few personnel, low technical levels, and simple equipment. Although there have been great improvements over the years since liberation, they generally could only perform minor surgeries. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, medical personnel liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and vigorously studied technology. Now, most can perform more complex major surgeries. The improvement of technical level has reduced the pain and economic burden of patients, accelerated the recovery of diseases, and promoted production, which is welcomed by the masses.

    **Extensive Visits to Talents to Collect Medicine, More Than 200,000 Prescriptions Offered by Traditional Chinese Medicine and Herbal Medicine Practitioners Throughout the Region**

In implementing the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, our region has also achieved great achievements in Western medicine practitioners learning traditional Chinese medicine, offering prescriptions and treasures, and developing the research of traditional Chinese and herbal medicine. Eighty percent of the region's health personnel have learned acupuncture. Teachers and students of medical and health schools at all levels throughout the region have generally gone to the countryside to conduct visits to talents to collect medicine in conjunction with pest elimination and disease control. For example, 18 teachers and more than 600 students from Guangxi Medical College traveled to five regions and twelve counties, visited traditional Chinese and herbal medicine practitioners, collected more than 60,000 single prescriptions, secret prescriptions, and effective prescriptions, and collected more than 1,700 kinds of medicinal materials, totaling more than 20,000 kilograms. Traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine practitioners throughout the region have offered more than 280,000 prescriptions. Now, using acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, and herbal medicine to treat diseases has become a trend among medical personnel. Western medicine practitioners are learning traditional Chinese medicine while using it. To adapt to the large-scale use of Chinese medicine and reverse the phenomenon of Chinese medicine shortages, and to implement the State Council's directive to vigorously develop the production of Chinese medicinal materials, people's communes, farms, and forest farms have generally planted Chinese medicinal materials. Many counties and communes have established specialized institutions to organize professional teams to transplant and plant in large quantities. Last year, the region planted more than 140,000 mu, and this year it is required to plant up to 250,000 mu, with 150 to 200 varieties. The Health Department has also organized the planting of more than 4,700 mu. Rongxian County had planted 41,570 mu by the end of March this year, and one commune in Liujiang County planted 1,040 mu, and also closed mountains to raise geckos and prepared to raise musk deer and other animals. The planting of Guangxi's special medicinal materials such as *Panax notoginseng*, cinnamon, star anise, *Siraitia grosvenorii*, amomum, and dendrobium has also been greatly developed. Because the people's communes have universally arranged for traditional Chinese and herbal medicine practitioners, their enthusiasm has been fully exploited. They go to the mountains to collect medicine, make medicine, and plant medicine. According to incomplete statistics last year, 574 pharmaceutical factories have been established, collecting more than 1.5 million kilograms of medicine and producing 656 kinds of finished products. Because the source of medicines has been solved, many counties in the region now have all communes providing free medicine. Because the commune's medical network has been formed, commune members generally do not leave the production team for minor illnesses and do not leave the commune for mild illnesses. The masses sing praises, which powerfully promotes the Great Leap Forward in production. These are all the results of vigorously implementing the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy.

    **Medical Workers Go Deep into the Masses, Saving Lives and Healing the Wounded, Deeply Loved by the Masses**

The great achievements we have achieved above should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party, the glorious illumination of the general line, resolutely relying on the masses, following the mass line, and inseparable from the unprecedented improvement of the ideological awareness of health personnel in last year's rectification and anti-rightist struggles. The ideological leap forward of health personnel last year was manifested in fundamentally reversing the past three-separations phenomenon of being separated from politics, separated from the masses, and separated from reality. They established the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, clarified that the leadership of the Party is the first priority, thereby improving medical style and service attitude, giving full play to the high enthusiasm for work, improving the sense of responsibility for work, revising a series of unreasonable medical systems, greatly facilitating patients, and actively participating in physical labor to exercise themselves. Therefore, the Party's guidelines and policies have been victoriously implemented. Health personnel actively responded to the Party's call, fearing no hardship, going to the mountains and countryside, rushing to water conservancy and steel construction sites. Wherever there are people, there is medicine and treatment, taking the initiative to go to streets, factories, and mines, reversing the past phenomenon of medicine not leaving the door. Thanks to the leadership of the Party committee and the selfless labor of health personnel, working hard day and night, and going deep into the workers' sheds, the 100,000 troops on the Nandan steel construction site sent away the plague god and rarely had absenteeism due to illness or injury, ensuring the production of steel. On the steel construction site, four people including Li Wenzhao risked their lives and rushed into the smoky kiln to rescue steel warriors who had fallen in; nurse Hu Qihua, in order to rescue critically ill patients, urgently sucked out the phlegm blocking the patient's throat with her mouth; in order to rescue scalded workers, eight medical personnel from Guilin City competed to donate their precious blood and skin. These touching examples, highly promoting the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism, the communist style of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me," have established a red banner in the health team and are a powerful guarantee for the Great Leap Forward in health work. Not only in high and intermediate health personnel, but also in the vast number of primary health personnel in rural areas, politics is put in command and enthusiasm soars. Since the people's communes were formed, rural maternal and child care hospitals have been universally established. In order to further liberate women's labor and ensure the safety of mothers and infants, and to implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running maternity hospitals, many midwives became carpenters and plasterers, building maternity hospitals by themselves from cowsheds and oil-frying rooms, building houses, making delivery beds and furniture, and using old clothes to make infant clothes and bedding. In order to better care for mothers and improve their nutrition, they grow their own vegetables, raise chickens, raise pigs, go to the mountains to collect firewood, burn charcoal, and plant Chinese medicine for mothers to eat, use, and keep warm. They are responsible for picking up, delivering, cooking, delivering babies, washing bloody pants, taking care of the mother's older children, providing health knowledge to mothers, conducting painless childbirth, and also organizing cultural and recreational activities for mothers. When mothers go home, each person is given ten kilograms of vegetables and charcoal. Afterwards, they also regularly go to the mothers' homes to bathe the babies, and sometimes help with carrying water, cooking, and washing clothes. The enthusiasm of midwives has won the enthusiastic love of the masses, who everywhere call the midwives "grandmothers." Some areas have strictly implemented prenatal checkups, and all mothers are hospitalized for delivery, significantly reducing difficult births and completely eliminating neonatal tetanus and puerperal fever in mothers. The skills of the midwives have been improved. They perform painless childbirths, rarely causing perineal tears, and are able to handle some difficult births themselves. The masses reflected: In the past, "if you have the fate, you can eat ginger soup, if you don't have the fate, you will see King Yama," but now that is a thing of the past.

Although our region's health work has achieved great achievements, compared with advanced fraternal provinces and autonomous regions, our work is still far from adequate and there are still many problems. The summary of experience is not enough and far from meeting the requirements of the development of the situation. 1959 is a decisive year for three years of hard struggle. This year, there will be a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. As a health care undertaking that guarantees production, the task will be more arduous and difficult. We have no reason to be complacent. We must muster greater efforts, strive for the upstream, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully. We must complete and overfulfill the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1959 for our health work. Combining the specific situation of our region, implement Premier Zhou's instructions to "carry out the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests and eliminating major diseases, unite traditional Chinese and Western medicine, promote the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine and develop medical science," mobilize all the health forces in the region to make greater achievements and dedicate them to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    卫生工作取得了伟大成就
    李任仁　黄征　叶培  覃波代表
    谈广西僮族自治区卫生工作主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。周总理总结了一九五八年全国大跃进的成就，指出了一九五九年的任务，对我们的鼓舞很大，我们完全有信心完成或超额完成这一任务。现将广西僮族自治区卫生工作随着工农业大跃进的推动而发展的情况，作如下的发言。
    我区卫生工作通过了整风反右，在社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，关于卫生机构的建立，除害灭病，中医中药，技术革新，医院工作，培养干部，人民公社卫生，妇幼卫生等各方面，都取得了前所未有的辉煌成就，保障了劳动人民的身体健康，大力支援和促进了生产。
    自从党的八大二次会议提出了技术革命和文化革命的任务以后，我区卫生部门，和全国其他地区一样，以除害灭病为中心，干劲冲天，破除迷信，解放思想，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，在全区掀起了一个技术革命的高潮，每天都有新的技术革新项目出现。由于有党的正确领导，充分发动群众，依靠群众，贯彻了群众运动与科学技术相结合，洋土并举，中西医结合，大、中、小相结合，结合实际，结合生产的方针，使我区在科学技术，提高医疗质量等方面，都取得了巨大的成就。在人人献计，个个想办法的号召下，全区初步发现了樟树叶、百部叶等一百五十余种效果良好的杀灭蚊、蝇，钉螺的野生植物，对于除害灭病，起到了很大的作用。治疗高血压的萝芙木。我区估计每县都有野生，产量丰富，最近经临床和药理试验，初步证明确有良好疗效，中国医学科学院初步证明其中含有纯生物碱“利血平”。今后如能投入生产，可以节约大量外汇。中、草医治疗麻风，各县方法很多，仅仅根据岑溪、平南、东兰三个县的中医单方，经短期应用即初步发现临床症状大部分消失较快，麻风反应出现很轻，麻风杆菌开始出现断裂现象，病理切片有很大改善，为了做出结论，现仍在继续观察中。广西毒蛇多，民间治疗毒蛇咬伤，经验丰富，如草药蛇总管等，都有很高疗效。骨折治疗，是民间草医的专长，方法繁多，一般对于消肿，止痛效果迅速，对于缩短治疗时间，亦有一定作用。最近应用甘蔗代替柳枝接骨，在动物试验已经初步获得了成功。发挥中、草医药治疗腹泻、痢疾、流感等病，在基建、水利、钢铁工地上，就地取材，就地炼制，就地应用，起到了一定的防治作用，有力地保证了大规模施工的进行和钢铁元帅的升帐。采用针灸止痛，代替麻醉，治疗阑尾炎等病，收效迅速，普遍受到群众的欢迎。我区县级医院解放前人员少，技术水平低，设备简陋。解放后历年虽经很大改进，但一般仍只能做小型手术。经过一九五八年的大跃进，医务人员思想解放，破除迷信，大力钻研技术，现在多数已能做较复杂的大手术。技术水平的提高，减轻了病人的痛苦和经济负担，加速了疾病的康复，促进了生产，受到群众的欢迎。
    广泛访贤采药，全区中医、草医献方献宝二十余万条
    在贯彻中医政策方面，我区在西医学习中医，献方献宝，开展中、草医药的研究等方面，也取得了巨大的成就。全区卫生人员，百分之八十已经学会了针灸。全区各级医药卫生学校的师生，普遍下乡结合除害灭病进行访贤采药工作。如广西医学院十八位老师和六百余学生，走遍了五个专区，十二个县，拜访中、草医，收集六万余单方、秘方、验方，采集药材一千七百余种，二万余斤。全区中医、草医献方献宝共二十八万余条。现在用针灸、中、草医药治病，已经在医务人员中形成了风气，西医学习中医，边学边用。为了适应中药的大量使用，扭转中药脱销的现象，贯彻国务院大力发展中药材生产的指示，人民公社、农场、林场普遍种植了中药材，许多县和公社，成立了专门机构，组织专业队伍，大量移植和栽种，去年全区已种十四万余亩，今年更要求种至二十五万亩，品种一百五十至二百种，卫生厅亦组织种植四千七百余亩。容县至今年三月底已种四万一千五百七十余亩，柳江县一个公社种了一千零四十亩，还封山养蛤蚧并准备养麝等动物。广西的特产药材如田七、肉桂、八角、罗汉果、砂仁、石斛等的种植，亦有大量发展。由于人民公社普遍安排了中草医，他们的积极性得到了充分的发挥，上山采药，制药，种药，去年据不完全统计，已建立了五百七十四个制药厂，采药一百五十万余斤，制出成品六百五十六种。由于药品来源解决，现在全区有好些县的全部公社作到吃药不要钱。由于公社的医疗网已经形成，社员一般小病不出生产大队，轻病不出公社，群众歌诵，有力地促进了生产的大跃进，这些都是大力贯彻了党的中医政策的结果。
    医务工作者深入群众，救死扶伤，深受群众爱戴
    我们取得以上的巨大成就，应当归功于党的英明领导，总路线的光辉照耀，坚决依靠群众，走群众路线，并和去年的整风反右，卫生人员思想觉悟的空前提高分不开的。去年卫生人员思想大跃进，表现在基本扭转了过去脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离实际的三脱离现象，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，明确了千条万条，党的领导是第一条，从而改善了医疗作风和服务态度，发挥了工作的高度积极性，提高了工作的责任心，修改了一系列的不合理的医疗制度，大大方便病人，还积极参加体力劳动，锻炼自己。因此党的方针政策得到胜利的贯彻，党的号召，卫生人员积极响应，不畏辛苦，上山下乡，奔赴水利、钢铁工地，哪里有人，哪里就有医有药，主动下街道、厂矿，一反过去医药不出门的现象。由于党委挂帅，卫生人员的忘我劳动，日夜苦干，深入工棚，使得南丹钢铁工地十万大军，送走瘟神，绝少因病因伤缺勤，保障了钢铁元帅升帐。在钢铁工地上，更出现了李文昭等四人，冒着生命危险，冲入浓烟窑炉中，抢出跌进去的钢铁战士；护士胡启华，为了抢救危重病人，临急用口吸出堵塞在病人喉咙的痰液；为了抢救被烫伤的工人，桂林市八个医务人员争先献出自己珍贵的血液与皮肤。这些可歌可泣的事例，高度发扬革命人道主义的精神，我为人人，人人为我的共产主义风格，已在卫生队伍中树立起了红旗，是卫生工作大跃进的有力保证。不但在高中级卫生人员，即在广大农村的初级卫生人员中，也莫不政治挂帅，干劲冲天。自从人民公社化以后，农村妇产院普遍建立了起来。为了更多地解放妇女劳动力，保障产妇婴儿的安全，贯彻勤俭办产院的精神，许多接生员当木匠、泥水匠，自己动手把牛栏、油炸房改成产院，修建房屋，制产床、家俱，用旧衣服改为婴儿衣服、被褥。为了更好地照顾产妇，改善产妇的营养，自己种菜，养鸡，养猪，上山打柴，烧炭，种中药，供产妇吃、用、取暖，对产妇包接、送、煮饭、接生、洗血裤、带产妇的大孩子、给产妇宣传卫生知识、进行无痛分娩、还给产妇搞文娱活动。当产妇回家时，每人赠送菜和炭各十斤。以后还定期到产妇家中给婴儿洗澡，有时帮挑水、煮饭、洗衣服。接生员的干劲冲天，赢得了群众对她们的热情爱戴，到处称接生员为外婆。有些地区严格执行了产前检查，产妇生产全部住院化，显著减少了难产，彻底消灭了新生儿破伤风和产妇产褥热。接生员的技术提高了，进行无痛分娩，很少发生会阴破裂，自己能够解决了一部分难产的处理。群众反映：以前“有命吃姜汤，无命见阎王”，如今已经一去不复返了。
    我区卫生工作虽然取得了很大成就，但比之先进兄弟省和自治区，我们的工作还做得很不够，存在问题也还不少，总结经验不够，远远不能适应形势发展的要求。一九五九年是苦战三年具有决定性的一年，今年工农业将要出现一个更大、更好、更全面的大跃进。作为保障生产的卫生保健事业，任务将要更加繁重与艰巨，我们没有任何理由自满，我们必须鼓足更大的干劲，力争上游，苦干、实干、巧干，一定要完成和超额完成一九五九年工农业大跃进对我们卫生工作的要求，结合我区的具体情况，贯彻周总理所指示的“以除四害，消灭主要疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，团结中、西医，发扬祖国医学遗产和发展医药科学”，动员全区所有卫生力量做出更大的成绩，向国庆十周年献礼。
