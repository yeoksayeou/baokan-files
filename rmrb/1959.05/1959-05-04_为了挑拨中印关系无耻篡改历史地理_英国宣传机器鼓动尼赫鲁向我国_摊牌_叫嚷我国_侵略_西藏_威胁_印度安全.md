Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from London: The British propaganda machine continues to use the methods they have employed since the Tibetan rebellion to alienate relations between Asian countries, and spare no effort to instigate India and other Asian and African countries to oppose Communism and China.

An article published by the British Information Service on April 30 entitled "The Significance of Tibet" is dedicated to undermining the enormous prestige that China and the Soviet Union have gained in the eyes of the people of nationalist countries due to their consistent and firm support for national independence movements. At the beginning of the article, echoing the Indian expansionists, it quoted the Indian People's Socialist Party leader Narayan's slander against China. Narayan said:
  "In Tibet, we have seen the activities of a new imperialism far more dangerous than the old imperialism."
    The article went on to say: "This shock is understandable. However, it should not have been surprising that the Communist regime would take such action against small countries that its armed forces can reach."
    The article then made every effort to attack China and the Soviet Union for their so-called "two-faced" attitude towards the nationalist movement. It shamelessly manipulated such methods as completely distorting and disregarding the true situation of ethnic minorities in China and the Soviet Union, and trying to confuse a country's internal affairs with international relations. The article said that the Soviet Union and China have made a gesture of being friends and sponsors of weak nations, "However, this support for nationalism has been strictly limited to nationalism outside the borders of the communist empire. Within the borders, all nationalist movements, all demands for autonomy and self-determination have been ruthlessly suppressed."

    The article smeared that in China, "under the Communist 'banner', the Han Chinese are still oppressing the ethnic minorities of the empire they inherited."

    The article said, "What is happening in Tibet is not an isolated and special event. For any unfortunate small country within the sphere of influence of either of these two great communist countries, this has happened in the past and is happening now."

    "News Chronicle" has spared no effort in its comments and reports on Tibet in recent days to provoke Sino-Indian relations. In a report on April 29, it tried to create the impression that China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion constituted a so-called "threat" to Indian security. It also deliberately made alarming statements to intimidate people of all countries, saying that Asia "will suffer the most tragic disaster in two months," "the whole process of co-existence will be re-adjusted," and so on.

    This newspaper maliciously provoked, saying that Nehru has been "very cautiously eager to keep India away from the Cold War conspiracy," but now India is facing "some very cold material threats." According to this newspaper, this "threat" is the "dangerous border of 1,800 miles that has never existed between China and India in the past."
    People cannot help but notice that in order to achieve the purpose of provocation, this newspaper actually rewrites history and geography, completely ignoring the fact that China and India have long been neighboring countries, and blindly saying that "throughout history, the two countries of India and China have never been geographically adjacent," but were sandwiched by Tibet, this "huge buffer zone". Obviously, it attempts to achieve the purpose of denying that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory by this despicable method.

    An article from New Delhi published in this newspaper on April 30 again provoked Sino-Indian relations based on Nehru's speech in the Indian People's House on April 27. It said that there is no longer a "mutually tolerant no man's land" between China and India, "the challenge has been made", and now it is time for a "showdown". This article also praised Nehru's speech, saying that this speech was "one of the most outstanding statements Nehru has ever made. It is refined, clear, exquisitely worded, and what it expresses is exactly between anger and defense, between blame and understanding." It also said, "People will realize after a while that this is a challenge. The two major Asian countries (the most populous in the world) have since walked away from the umbrella of mutual tolerance, no longer standing hand in hand, but facing each other." The article also said, "For Nehru, this is an unavoidable moment of annoyance."

    The article also clamored: "No matter what kind of sophistry is made about the actions in Tibet, in the eyes of 200 million non-aligned Asians, this action is not just aggression, but the first large-scale Asian imperialist aggression since Genghis Khan." The article finally issued a desperate wail: "Now Tibet itself is finished. What really matters now is that all Asians see the truth at the same time it is finished."

    为了挑拨中印关系无耻篡改历史地理
    英国宣传机器鼓动尼赫鲁向我国“摊牌”
    叫嚷我国“侵略”西藏“威胁”印度安全
    新华社2日讯　伦敦消息：英国宣传机器继续采用它们在西藏叛乱发生以后一直采用的手法，离间亚洲国家的关系，竭力唆使印度和其他亚非国家来反共、反中国。
    英国新闻处4月30日以“西藏的意义”为题发表的一篇文章，致力于破坏中苏两国由于一贯坚决支持民族独立运动而在民族主义国家人民心目中获得的巨大威望。文章一开头就同印度扩张主义分子相呼应，引用了印度人民社会党首领纳拉扬对中国的诬蔑。纳拉扬说：
  “在西藏，我们看到了比旧帝国主义远为危险的新帝国主义的种种活动。”
    文章接着说：“这种震动是可以理解的。可是，对于这种情况就是共产党政权对它的武装力量能够达到的小国竟然采取这种做法，本来确实不应该感到意外。”
    文章接着竭力攻击中国和苏联对民族主义运动采取所谓“两面”态度，它无耻地玩弄了这样的手法，就是彻头彻尾地歪曲和不顾中苏两国国内少数民族的地位的真实情况，并且力图把一个国家的内政问题和国际关系混淆起来。文章说，苏联和中国作出了弱小民族的朋友和赞助者的姿态，“但是，对民族主义的这种支持一直严格地限于共产主义帝国边界以外的民族主义。在边界以内，一切民族主义运动，一切要求自治和自决的愿望都受到了无情的镇压。”
    文章污蔑说，在中国，“在共产主义的
  ‘旗帜’下，汉族还在压迫他们所继承的帝国的少数民族。”
    文章说，“正在西藏发生的事件并不是什么孤立的和特殊的事情。对任何不幸处在这两大共产主义国家中任何一个国家的势力范围之内的小国来说，这种事情在过去发生过，现在正在发生。”
    “新闻纪事报”连日来在它的有关西藏的评论和报道中不遗余力地挑拨中印关系。在4月29日的一篇报道中，它力图造成这样一种印象，似乎中国平定西藏叛乱构成了所谓对印度安全的“威胁”。它还故作危言来恫吓各国人民，说什么亚洲“在两个月后将遭到最惨重的灾难”，“共处的整个过程将重新调整”等等。
    这家报纸恶毒地挑拨说，尼赫鲁一直“很审慎地渴望使印度远离冷战阴谋”，但是现在印度已经面临着“某种十分冷酷的物质上的威胁”。据这家报纸说，这一“威胁”就是中、印两国之间“过去从来没有存在过的一千八百英里的危险的边界”。
    人们不能不注意到：为了达到挑拨的目的，这家报纸竟然改写历史和地理，一笔抹煞中、印两国长久以来一直是接境的邻国这一事实，瞎说什么“在整个历史上，印度和中国这两个国家在地理上从来没有接过壤”，而是夹着西藏这个“巨大的缓冲区”。显然，它妄图通过这种卑劣手法来达到否认西藏是中国领土的不可分割的一部分的目的。
    这家报纸4月30日登载的一篇从新德里发回的文章又就尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院的讲话挑拨中印关系，它说，中印两国之间已不再有一个“相互容忍的无人地带”，“挑战已经提出了”，现在是要“摊牌”了。这篇文章还为尼赫鲁的讲话捧场，说这个讲话是尼赫鲁所发表的“最卓越的声明之一，它精炼、明确、用词极妙，它所表达的东西恰好介乎愤怒和辩解之间，责备与谅解之间”。它还说，“人们要过一会工夫最后才意识到这就是挑战，两大亚洲国家（全世界人口最众多的）从此从互相容忍的伞下走开了，不再是手挽着手站在一起了，而是面对着面”。文章还说，“对尼赫鲁来说，这是无法逃避的懊恼的时刻”。
    文章还叫嚣说：“无论对西藏行动提出怎样的诡辩，在两亿不参加集团的亚洲人看来，这种行动不仅仅是侵略，而且是自从成吉思汗以后第一次规模较大的亚洲的帝国主义的侵略”。文章最后发出了绝望的哀鸣：“现在西藏自身是完了。目前真正要紧的是在它完了的同时使所有的亚洲人看到真相”。
