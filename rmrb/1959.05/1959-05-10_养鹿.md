The Agricultural Second Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps plans to capture and raise 800 young deer in the Tarim area this year in order to prepare for the large-scale development of deer farming in the area in the future.

The lower reaches of the Tarim River are a relatively concentrated area for deer herds. According to local farmers, herdsmen, and wasteland surveyors, deer are active everywhere in the grassy lake areas and among the red willow bushes near the water. Deer herds are particularly concentrated in some areas with lush water and grass and secluded environments. For example, around Lake Luohuluoke, there are more than 2,000 deer of various sizes. If people enclose it with barbed wire, it would be a very good natural deer farm. In the Tieganli and Wuluke areas, there are often three to four thousand deer active. In order to capture and raise these precious deer, some farms here began capturing and raising young deer in the autumn of last year. Tarim Third Farm captured more than 40 young deer in just a few days. These young deer have been carefully raised by the people, most of them have survived, and they have grown very fat and strong, and are very obedient to the breeders. Now, when people walk into the deer herd, as long as they call the deer's name or number, the deer will immediately run to the person; the seven young deer raised by Tarim Fourth Farm now automatically return every evening after being released in the morning. These situations show that the lower reaches of the Tarim River are not only a place rich in deer and with prospects for developing deer farming, but also that these existing deer, as long as someone manages them, have the potential to be transformed from wild animals into livestock.

Now, in order to complete the plan to capture and raise 800 young deer and to prepare for the large-scale development of deer farming in the future, all farms are preparing to organize a special group of people to carry out the capture of young deer during the doe's calving period. In order to facilitate future capture work, some farms have conducted reconnaissance of areas where deer herds are frequently active and where does are likely to calve; some farms, in order to train specialized personnel in this area, have sent people to the Northeast to learn deer farming experience.

　　养鹿
    新疆生产建设兵团农业第二师在塔里木地区的各农场，今年计划在当地捕捉八百只幼鹿进行饲养，以便为这个地区今后大量发展养鹿业作好准备。
    塔里木河下游地区，是个鹿群比较集中的地方。据当地的农牧民和荒地勘测人员说，这里的草湖地带和靠近水的红柳丛中，到处都有鹿群活动。在一些水草丰美、环境僻静的地方，鹿群特别集中。如罗乎罗克湖的周围，有大小鹿约两千只以上，人们如用铁丝把它圈起来，就是一个很好的天然鹿场。在铁干里和乌鲁克一带，经常也有三、四千只鹿在活动。为了把这些珍贵的鹿只捕捉起来进行饲养，这里有些农场，从去年的秋天起，就开始了幼鹿的捕捉和饲养工作。塔里木三场在短短的几天，就捕捉了四十多只幼鹿，这些幼鹿经人们的精心饲养，大部分都成活了，并长得很肥壮，很听饲养人员的话，现在当人们走进鹿群之后，只要叫一声那个鹿的名字或号数，这只鹿就会立即跑到人跟前来；塔里木四场饲养的七只幼鹿，现在每天早晨放出去后，晚上就自动都回来了。这些情况表明，塔里木河下游地区不仅是个盛产鹿和发展养鹿业有前途的地方，而且现有的这些鹿只要有人去管它，完全有可能由野生动物变为家畜的。
    现在，各农场为了完成捕捉和饲养八百只幼鹿的计划，并给今后大量发展养鹿业作好准备，他们都准备在母鹿产仔期间，专门组织一批人进行幼鹿的捕捉工作。有些农场为了将来便于进行捕捉工作，对一些鹿群经常活动的地方和母鹿可能产仔的地方都进行了侦察；有些农场为了培养这方面的专门人材，已派人到东北学习养鹿经验。（附图片）
