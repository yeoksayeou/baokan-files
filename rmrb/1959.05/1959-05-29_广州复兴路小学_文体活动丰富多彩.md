Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th - While vigorously strengthening teaching work, Fuxing Road Primary School in the Shameen district of Guangzhou actively carries out rich and colorful extracurricular recreational and sports activities, based on the characteristics of children. This promotes the all-round development of children's intelligence, physical strength, and communist morality, and also plays a certain role in enhancing students' interest in learning.

Fuxing Road Primary School began to pay attention to organizing children's extracurricular activities in the second half of last year. While teachers focused on classroom teaching, they actively organized students to participate in extracurricular recreational and sports activities. At present, the school has carried out dozens of extracurricular recreational and sports activities, including singing, dancing, drama, piano, storytelling, playing ball, playing chess, and gymnastics. When carrying out extracurricular recreational and sports activities, each grade has chosen different focuses based on the different ages of the children. Children in lower grades generally focus on sports games, singing, dancing, and storytelling; children in higher grades focus on more complex and diverse activities such as playing ball, drama, playing the piano, and playing chess. After these activities were carried out, many excellent young athletes and young artists emerged in the school. The students' interest in learning has been continuously improved. At the same time, the children's character has also been cultivated. One student used to be undisciplined and had poor academic performance. Teachers and parents felt that she was a difficult case. After the school carried out extracurricular activities, she participated in the violin group and the choir. Because these activities brought her talents into play, she is now a well-known violinist in the school; her enthusiasm for learning has also increased, and she now often gets a score of five.

    广州复兴路小学
    文体活动丰富多彩
    据新华社广州28日电　广州市中区沙面复兴路小学在大力加强教学工作的同时，根据儿童的特点开展丰富多彩的课余文娱体育活动，促进了儿童智力、体力和共产主义品德全面成长，对提高学生们的学习兴趣也起了一定的作用。
    复兴路小学是从去年下半年开始注意组织儿童课外活动的。教师们在抓紧课堂教学的同时，积极组织学生们参加课外文娱体育活动。现在，全校已经开展的课外文娱体育活动，有歌咏、舞蹈、戏剧、钢琴、说书、打球、下棋、体操等几十种。在开展课余文娱体育活动的时候，各个年级都根据儿童年龄不同，选择了不同的重点。低年级的儿童一般以体育游戏、唱歌、舞蹈和讲故事等为主；高年级儿童则以打球、戏剧、弹琴、下棋等比较复杂多样的活动为主。这些活动开展后，学校里出现了许多优秀的少年运动员和小艺术家。学生们的学习兴趣不断提高。同时也陶冶了儿童的性格。有一个学生过去不守纪律，学习成绩很差，教师和家长对她都感到棘手。学校开展课外活动后，她参加了小提琴组和歌咏队，由于这些活动发挥了她的才能，现在她已成为全校著名的小提琴手；学习积极性也提高了，现在经常得到五分。
