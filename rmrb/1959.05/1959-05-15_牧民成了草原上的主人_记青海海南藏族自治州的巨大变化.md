Herdsmen Become Masters of the Grassland
——A Record of the Tremendous Changes in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai
By Our Correspondent Zhao Huaiqing

The Yellow River flows from the Bayan Har Mountains to the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai, where a vast grassland stretches out on its southern bank. Mountains form a green barrier for the grassland, and the Qingkang Highway, like a python, winds across the chest of the grassland. Nearly two thousand Tibetan people of the Dengta People's Commune in Xinghai County live happily here.

When I arrived at the grassland, the grass and wheat seedlings had already sprouted. Tibetan men and women in colorful costumes were busy walking beside the shimmering canals, watering the newly reclaimed land. Flocks of sheep, like white clouds, were clustered together, wriggling on the distant slopes. The fish-scale-like tents in the settlements, like mushrooms after the rain, suddenly emerged. Next to the tents stand newly built factories, making the grassland even more beautiful.

Saying Goodbye to a Poor and Dark Era

Looking at the thriving grassland, who would have thought that its past was so tragic! From ancient times, the herdsmen lived a nomadic life, moving with the water and grass, engaged in a single animal husbandry, living a wandering life, and their population declining day by day. Under the exploitation and oppression of reactionary headmen and herdowners, the herdsmen were in deep water. In those dark years, how many elderly people, inadequately clothed, suffered from cold and hunger, exposing their icy bodies to the grassland! How many people lived in constant fear, worrying about surprise raids and robberies by bandits (Ma Bufang bandits)! And how many people were bent over by life, snatching food to fill their stomachs from the mouths of the herdowners' fat dogs! The ancient grassland was full of blood and tears! The reporter once heard a heartbreaking accusation from a "Nie Shipi" (vagrant) who had his hands cut off and his wife taken away by a herdowner:

It was the winter of 1948. The reactionary herdowner Hua Rang seized the wife of the working herdsman Cai Hengsong, who was nine months pregnant. Cai Hengsong secretly discussed with his wife about escaping the bitter sea together. One night, when they escaped to a place called Woneihai, Hua Rang arrived with his dozen or so lackeys, hacking at Cai Hengsong's head with a broadsword, and shouted fiercely, "You have such guts! How did you come, now get back the same way!" The knife wound caused Cai Hengsong to faint. Hua Rang then cut off both of his hands. After committing the crime, the executioners determined that his life could not be saved and carried him to an uninhabited meadow. The next morning, when the brutal Hua Rang returned with his men, Cai Hengsong was groaning weakly. When Hua Rang saw that he had not died, he came up with an even more vicious method: Cai Hengsong's two bleeding arms were put into a pot of boiling oil. Cai Hengsong screamed and lost consciousness. When he woke up again, he saw the lackeys holding red-hot shovels and burning him all over. He shouted and cursed these man-eating jackals, demanding that they kill him quickly. In order to make Cai Hengsong's wife forget her husband forever, the brutal Hua Rang ordered them to slash his face randomly. From then on, Cai Hengsong was deprived of all rights to life. For many nights and days, he had pondered a question: "What is the purpose of living?" He had thought of death a thousand times, but each time he was met with the kind concern of poor friends, and the fiery hearts encouraged him to continue living. He spent his days wandering and begging, waiting for that day....

Liberation! The day he was waiting for finally arrived! The Party wiped away the shadows and despair in his heart, took care of his life, and the strong belief in living on burned in Cai Hengsong's heart again. He installed two iron rings on his armless limbs, studied hard, and learned to slaughter sheep and hunt. He once again gained the ability to make a living. After the communalization of the grassland, Cai Hengsong became a herdsman in the commune. He never dreamed that he could live such a happy life today. Unable to suppress the joy in his heart, he sang loudly about the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to the valley.

The crimes of the herdowner class are too numerous to record. Before liberation, they used cruel methods such as exploiting hired herders, lending at usurious rates, extorting, defrauding, and imposing exorbitant taxes. Politically, they had shocking privileges such as setting up private courts, seizing women, and commanding tribal armed forces. After liberation, although most of the political privileges were abolished, economic exploitation was still retained. The Party and the People's Government waited for their awakening. By 1957, when the upsurge of grassland cooperation arrived, a small handful of extremely reactionary headmen and herdowners not only did not want to abandon feudal exploitation, but intensified their efforts, stubbornly resisted socialist transformation, and undermined cooperation. They occupied large areas of grassland, while the cooperative's cattle and sheep had nowhere to graze. They spread rumors, wooed and threatened members, and undermined the cooperative. Enough is enough, the liberated working herdsmen cannot be deceived! In 1958, a large-scale anti-feudal struggle finally swept the grassland. At the grievance meetings, people poured out their deep-seated hatreds, word by word, tear by tear. Cai Hengsong, a poor herdsman who had his hands cut off and his wife taken away, also accused the rapacious herdowner Hua Rang along with everyone else. The power of the masses was like a mountain torrent, like a thunderbolt, overthrowing the feudal mountain that was pressing down on them. The ownership of the means of production by the herdowner class, as well as the countless rules and privileges that oppressed and exploited the herdsmen, were destroyed, and the people declared the eternal demise of the serf system! The slaves turned over, and the herdsmen became the true masters of the grassland.

A Leap Over the Dragon Gate into Communalization

Defeating feudalism opened the way for building socialism on the grassland. In September last year, the grassland was communalized, and the enthusiasm of the herdsmen was boiling. The grassland seemed to have wings and was rapidly catching up with the advanced areas. People changed the nomadic life of wandering for thousands of years and settled down. Last winter and this spring, they changed the backward animal husbandry production methods of the past and enabled livestock to survive the lean season. The Party also trained more than 100 folk veterinarians among the herdsmen, effectively controlling the epidemic of livestock diseases. The commune's livestock has increased nearly twofold compared to before liberation. This year, people also proposed "breeding livestock without relying on the sky," breaking the convention of sheep producing only once a year, and carrying out estrus re-mating on ewes that had already given birth. In those days, in order not to delay grazing during the day, people used the night to administer estrus injections. Lanterns shone on the grassland, and beams of electric light intertwined in every sheepfold, regardless of the howling northwest wind! The elderly in the nursing home also came, and the production captain could not persuade them to go back. The re-mating of ewes reached 50% of all productive ewes, and the lambing rate this year can reach more than 100%.

In the past, herdsmen had to drive yaks across mountains and ridges for hundreds of miles to transport a grain of food. Since the defeat of feudal rule and the call for a great leap forward in production, 19 canals have been built on the grassland. One canal, which people had hoped to build for more than ten years but failed to, was finally completed in seven days under the leadership of the Party, and the water was brought to the mountain. Wheat and highland barley were sown on the newly reclaimed 4,000-plus mu of land. A female commune member named Re Lu told reporters: "In the past, I thought that grain grew on trees, or was dug from the mountains. I never dreamed that we could grow our own crops. When the wheat was about to ripen, the commune was afraid that livestock would trample it, so they asked me to guard it. At night, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. Under the moonlight, I don't know how many times I touched it." When there were no tools for planting crops, the masses came up with their own methods. Herdsman Ren Qian volunteered to go to the mountains to cut willow branches in the severe cold and snow, and wove more than 50 baskets. In working with Han cadres, he also learned agricultural techniques. Last year, they harvested more than 500,000 jin of grain, solving most of the food problem. This year, they want to achieve self-sufficiency and more in grain.

The newly built factories of the Dengta People's Commune, which serve agriculture, animal husbandry, and the lives of the commune members, shine with a different kind of light on the grassland. People use the chlortetracycline produced by their own factories to feed livestock. One sheep eats one or two a day, and can grow four more jin of meat in ten days. Some commune members held the soap produced by their own factories like treasures and compared it with that of the trading company. More than ten factories, from construction to production, have been carried out with the help of Han cadres and workers, who taught Tibetan workers some industrial knowledge and operating methods as if they were guiding them to trace flowers. They are proud to be the first generation of Tibetan workers.

In the settled grassland, the reporter also saw three newly established primary schools and a veterinary school.

The grassland, which used to be full of difficulties, has become young and radiant this year. Whether it is the elderly or the children, their lives have been most reliably guaranteed. The socialist spirit and enthusiasm are stirring in people.

Relationships Between People

After the democratic reform, the reporter saw the new relationships between people on the grassland. In the past, the A'quhu and Shenwu tribes often caused disturbances due to disputes over grassland. The headmen and herdowners used all kinds of vicious and despicable tricks to provoke disputes and seize profits. For example, Cai Gai, the headman of the Shenwu tribe, deliberately encouraged herdsmen from the A'quhu tribe to move to his grassland. When they moved, he led people to say that others were encroaching on his grassland. After these bad guys were overthrown by the masses, the herdsmen of the two tribes quickly removed the boundary stones of the grassland, joined the commune, and became a harmonious family. Yin Meiji, a nursing home worker who grew up in the A'quhu tribe, said to Jie Mujia, an old herdsman from the Shenwu tribe: "Old man, don't treat me like an outsider. I will serve you like my own parents." Yin Meiji said so, and she did so. The old man had diarrhea at night and his legs were not good. She carried him out several times a night. On weekdays, she mixed fried noodles and brought them to the old man with both hands.

I saw that on a snowy night, a Han doctor heard that someone in the settlement was seriously ill, jumped out of bed, and without putting on a coat, rode his horse and disappeared into the dark grassland. I saw that in the grassland nurseries, each black and fat child always had a sweet smile on their lips. Mothers trust the nursery workers as much as they trust themselves. I saw that the old people with white hair, because they had forgotten the worries and pains of the past and had a reliable life, had become younger. Grassland, grassland! Let me sing a hymn for your new life! (Picture attached)

During the Great Leap Forward last year, the Sujitan People's Commune was established on the grassland of Hai Bei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province. Commune members implemented settled grazing, which led to a leap forward in animal husbandry production. This is a picture of commune members grazing on the grassland.

An agricultural machinery tractor station has been established at the foot of Xiliang Mountain in Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, a high and cold mountain area in northwestern Guizhou Province. This was donated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, so it was named "August 1st Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station."

    牧民成了草原上的主人
    ——记青海海南藏族自治州的巨大变化
    本报记者　赵淮青
    黄河顺着巴颜喀拉山，奔流到青海海南藏族自治州，在它的南岸，伸展开一片辽阔的草原。群山为草原结成青色的屏障，宛如蟒蛇的青康公路，从草原的胸膛上蜿蜒爬过。兴海县灯塔人民公社将近两千名藏族人民，在这里过着愉快幸福的生活。
    我到草原时，绿草和麦苗已经抽芽了。身着五光十色服装的藏族男女，正忙碌地走在银波鳞鳞的水渠旁，为新垦的土地浇水。白云似的羊群，簇簇堆堆的，蠕动在远处的山坡。定居点上鱼鳞般的帐房，就像雨后的蘑菇，突然涌现了出来。帐房旁边矗立着新建的工厂，把草原打扮得更加美丽。
    和贫穷黑暗的时代告别
    面对着欣欣向荣的草原，谁能想到它的过去竟是那样的悲惨！从久远的年代开始，牧民群众就过着逐水草而居、近似原始的游牧生活，经营着单一的畜牧业，颠沛流离、人丁日衰。在反动头人、牧主的压榨剥削下，牧民处在水深火热中。在那些黑暗的年代里，多少衣不蔽体的老人，挨冻受饿，把自己冰冷的身体暴露在草原！多少人日夜怀着战战兢兢的心，担心着马匪（马步芳匪徒）突袭抢劫！又有多少人被生活压弯了腰，从牧主的肥狗嘴中抢夺充饥的食物！古老的草原，充满了血泪！记者曾听到一个被牧主割去双手、夺走妻子的“聂拾匹”（流浪汉）的惨不忍闻的控诉：
    那是1948年的冬天，反动牧主华让霸占了劳动牧民才亨松的妻子，她已经怀孕九个月了。才亨松暗暗和妻子商量着一起逃出苦海，一天晚上，当他们逃到一个叫窝乃亥的地方时，华让带着他十几个狗腿子赶来，用大刀劈头向才亨松砍去，并恶狠狠地喝道：“你好大的狗胆！怎么来，再给我怎么滚回去！”刀伤使才亨松昏过去了，华让又砍去了他两只手。刽子手们行凶之后，断定他的命保不住，就把他抬到无人的草滩上去。第二天早上，当残暴的华让带着人又赶来时，才亨松正在微弱地呻吟着。华让一看还他没有死，就又想出了更恶毒的办法：才亨松的两只流血的臂膀，又被放进烧开的滚油锅里，才亨松惨叫一声，不省人事。等他又一次醒来，却看见狗腿子们正拿着烧红的铁铲在他身上乱烫，他叫喊，他咒骂这些吃人的豺狼，要求他们赶快把他处死。残暴的华让为了使才亨松的妻子永远忘记自己的丈夫，又吩咐在他脸上乱砍。从那时，才亨松被剥夺了一切生活的权利，多少个夜晚和白天，他曾长久地思索着一个问题：“活着究竟为了什么？”他曾千百次地想到死，而每一次都受到穷朋友的亲切的关怀，一颗颗火热的心鼓舞着他继续活下来。他在流浪、行乞中打发日子，他在等待着那么一天……。
    解放了，他等待的那一天终于到来了！党为他拂去心灵上的阴影和绝望，照顾了他的生活，坚强的活下去的信念又在才亨松的心中燃烧起来。他在两只没有手的臂膀上，安上两个铁圈，勤学苦练，学会了宰羊和打猎，他又一次取得了谋生的能力。在草原公社化以后，才亨松担任了公社的放牧员，他作梦也没想到自己今天还能过着这样愉快的日子，压抑不住心中的欢乐，对着山谷，放声歌唱着共产党和毛主席。
    牧主阶级的罪恶是罄竹难书的。解放前，他们用剥削牧工、放高利贷、敲诈勒索、诈骗、苛捐杂税等残酷的办法进行剥削；在政治上，他们有私设公堂、霸占女人、指挥部落武装等骇人听闻的特权。解放后，虽然政治上的特权大部取消了，经济上的剥削则仍然保留着。党和人民政府等待他们的觉悟，到1957年，当草原合作化的高潮到来时，一小撮极端反动的头人牧主，非但不想放弃封建剥削，却变本加厉，顽固地抗拒社会主义改造，破坏合作化。他们霸占着大面积的草山，合作社的牛羊却无处放牧；他们造谣拉拢、威胁社员，拆合作社的台。是可忍、孰不可忍，解放了的劳动牧民是不可欺侮的！1958年，一个大张旗鼓地反封建的斗争终于席卷了草原。人们在诉苦会上，一字一泪地倾诉了他们的血海深仇，失掉双手、被抢去妻子的贫苦牧民才亨松也和大家一起控诉了狼子野心的牧主华让。群众的力量有如山洪暴发、雷霆万钧，推倒了压在他们头上的封建大山。牧主阶级的生产资料所有制，以及压迫剥削牧民的数不清的清规戒律和特权被摧毁了，人民宣布了农奴制度的永远灭亡！奴隶翻了身，牧民群众成了草原上真正的主人。
    一跃龙门公社化
    打垮了封建，为草原建设社会主义开辟了道路。去年9月，草原公社化，牧民群众干劲沸腾，草原像插上了翅膀，在神速地追赶先进地区。人们改变千百年来飘泊流浪的游牧生活，定居下来。去冬今春，他们一改过去落后的畜牧业生产方法，使牲畜渡过了瘦弱关。党在牧民群众中，还培养了一百多名民间兽医，有力地控制了畜病流行。公社的牲畜比解放前增长将近两倍。今年，人们又提出“繁殖牲畜不靠天”，打破了绵羊一年一产的惯例，对已经产过的母绵羊进行催情复配。在那些日子里，为了不耽误白天放牧，人们利用晚上作催情注射，一盏盏马灯在草原上闪耀，一道道干电光柱交织着每个羊圈，哪管西北风呼呼叫唤！敬老院的老人也赶来了，生产队长劝也劝不回去。复配母羊达到全部生产母羊的50％，今年羊的繁殖率可以达到100％以上。
    以前，牧民吃一粒粮食都要赶着牦牛翻山越岭，从几百里以外运来。自从打垮封建统治，吹起了生产大跃进的号角，草原上修起水渠十九条，有一条水渠，人们盼望了十多年没修成，这次在党的领导下，群众的智慧闪亮了，七天就把水引上了山。在新垦的四千多亩土地上播上了小麦和青稞。一个叫热鲁的女社员告诉记者说：“以前我想粮食是树上结的，要不就是山上挖的，作梦也没想到我们自己也能种庄稼。麦子快成熟的时候，公社怕牲畜踏坏，叫我去守着，夜晚，我兴奋得睡不着，月光下，不知道去摸了它多少次。”种庄稼没工具，群众就自己想办法，牧民仁谦冒着严寒风雪，自报奋勇上山割柳条，编了五十多个筐子。在和汉族干部一起劳动中，又学会了农业技术。去年打了五十多万斤粮食，解决了大部分口粮，今年他们要作到粮食自给有余。
    灯塔人民公社新建的为农牧业和社员生活服务的工厂，在草原上闪耀着异样的光彩。人们用自己厂出产的土黴素喂牲畜，一只羊每天吃一两，十天可以多长四斤肉。有的社员像捧宝贝似的，拿着自己厂出产的肥皂去跟贸易公司的比。十多个工厂，从建厂到投入生产，一直是在汉族干部、工人的帮助下进行的，他们像把着手描花似的教藏族工人一些工业知识和操作方法。他们为自己成为藏族人民第一代工人而自豪。
    在定居后的草原，记者还看到了新办起的三所小学和一所畜牧兽医学校。
    曾经是困难重重的草原，今年变得年轻焕发了，不管是老年人，还是小孩子，生活都得到了最可靠的保证。社会主义精神和干劲在人们身上激荡着。
    人和人之间
    经过民主改革以后，记者看到了草原上人和人之间的新关系。过去，阿曲乎和申吾两个部落，经常因争夺草原引起风波，头人牧主为了挑起纠纷，从中攫取渔利，耍尽了恶毒卑劣的伎俩。如申吾部落头人采盖，故意怂恿阿曲乎部落牧民搬上他的草山，等到搬去了，他却领着人来了，硬说别人要侵占他的草山。这些坏家伙被群众斗倒后，两个部落的牧民很快搬掉了草山的界石，参加了公社，成为融洽无间的一家人。在阿曲乎部落长大的、敬老院服务员茵梅吉对申吾部落的一位老牧民杰木加说：“老阿爷呵，你别拿我当外人，我一定侍候您像对待我的亲爷娘一样。”茵梅吉这样说，也这样作了。老人晚上泻肚子，腿不好，她一夜背他出去几次。平日，她把炒面拌好，双手捧着碗送到老人面前。
    我看见，在一个风雪交加的夜晚，一位汉族医生听见定居点上有人患了重病，从被窝里一跃而起，没顾披大衣，骑上马消逝在漆黑的草原；我看见，草原托儿所里一个个黑胖黑胖的孩子，嘴角上永远挂着甜蜜的微笑，母亲们相信保育员，就像相信她们自己一样；我看见，雪鬓华发的老人，因为忘掉了过去的忧患和痛苦，生活有了依托，变得更加年轻了。草原呵，草原！让我为你的新生，放声唱一支颂歌！（附图片）
