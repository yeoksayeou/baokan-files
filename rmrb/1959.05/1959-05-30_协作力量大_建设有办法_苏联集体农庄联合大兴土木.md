Working together produces great strength, construction has its methods
Soviet Collective Farms Jointly Undertake Large-Scale Construction

    The construction of a huge medical city has begun a few kilometers from the center of the Zaqatala District of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. Four buildings, including a hospital, clinic, maternity hospital, and staff residences, will be built here.
    The construction of the medical city was initiated by the joint construction committee of four neighboring collective farms, which was established not long ago. The collective farms have allocated a total of approximately 1.5 million rubles for the construction of this medical city. In addition to the medical city, these collective farms will soon begin building a joint sanatorium. Relying on the strength of four comprehensive production teams, they will also jointly build kindergartens, nurseries, and housing for farm members. Laying water pipes and other projects are also included in the future work plan. In order to expand the production base, the joint construction committee of the collective farms decided to build a huge brick factory and open open-pit mines for the extraction of local building materials...
    What is happening in the rural areas of Azerbaijan is typical of the current construction in the rural areas of the Soviet Union. Large-scale production and housing construction are underway everywhere in the Soviet countryside. In the next seven years, basic construction investment in agriculture will reach approximately 500 billion rubles, of which collective farms will invest 250 billion rubles of their own funds in village construction and public welfare facilities. In order to use this huge amount of funds as masters of their own affairs and reduce construction costs, collective farms have joined forces to establish joint construction enterprises and joint construction committees.
    For example, in the villages of Belarus, more than 100 joint construction organizations of collective farms have been established. Collective farms allocate funds according to shares to equip sideline enterprises and workshops, and purchase automobiles and other machinery and equipment. The joint organizations of collective farms own 237 brick factories. This year, the collective farms will jointly build 110 new brick factories. After these brick factories are completed, together with the existing brick factories, they will produce 300 million bricks annually. Now, the joint committee of the collective farms has added 220 automobiles and 4,500 sets of various equipment.
    In the Stalin Oblast of Ukraine, 20 joint construction organizations of collective farms have been established. They have already begun construction of 13 joint cement, cinder, and brick factories. This year, the output of walling and roofing materials will increase by 50% to 100%. New quarries are being opened. The collectively run enterprises have training classes dedicated to training various construction personnel.
    Collective farms not only build houses and buildings necessary for their own production, but also build public buildings: schools, hospitals, kindergartens, nurseries, etc. For example, the Altai Territory has a widespread school network. The wasteland conquerors have made great contributions in this regard. Local collective farms have built more than 200 schools with their own funds, of which about half were completed in the autumn of 1958.
    Large-scale construction of school buildings is still underway this year in the Kulunda Steppe and the Altai Mountains. This year, collective farms will build more than 100 new schools, studios, and boarding schools with their own funds. The farms have allocated millions of rubles to build rural youth night schools, workshops, etc.
    In 1958, the collective farms in the Penza Oblast in the southeast of the Russian Federal Republic built approximately 100 clubs, dozens of rural reading rooms, libraries, red corners, etc. This year, they will build more new cultural bases. (Yige) (with picture)

    协作力量大　建设有办法
    苏联集体农庄联合大兴土木
    离阿塞拜疆苏维埃社会主义共和国查卡塔雷区中心数公里的地方，一座巨大的医疗城的建设开始了。这儿，将兴建医院、诊疗所、产院、服务人员住宅等四座楼房。
    医疗城的建设是根据不久前成立的四个相邻近的集体农庄联合建设委员会的倡议进行的。各集体农庄共拨了约一百五十万卢布用于建设这座医疗城。除了医疗城的建设以外，最近这几个集体农庄将开始兴建合用的疗养院。它们依靠四个综合生产队的力量还将共同建设幼儿园、托儿所和庄员住宅。敷设自来水管和其他工程也规定在今后的工作计划中。为了扩建生产基地，集体农庄联合建设委员会决定兴建巨大的砖瓦工厂，开辟为了开采当地建筑材料的露天采掘坑……
    阿塞拜疆农村所发生的情况是目前苏联农村建设的典型。在苏联农村里，到处在进行着大规模的生产建设和住宅建设。今后七年内，用于农业的基本建设投资将达五千亿卢布左右，其中集体农庄用自己的资金投入村庄建设和公共福利设施的数目达二千五百亿卢布。为了以主人翁的态度使用这笔巨大的资金，降低建筑成本，集体农庄联合自己的力量，成立了集体农庄的联合建筑企业和集体农庄的联合建设委员会。
    例如，在白俄罗斯的村庄里，成立了一百多个集体农庄的联合建筑组织。各集体农庄按股份拨出资金装备了副业企业、作坊，购买了汽车以及其他机械和设备。集体农庄的联合机构拥有二百三十七座制砖厂。今年，集体农庄还将合力新建一百一十座制砖厂，待这些制砖厂建成后，加上现有的制砖厂每年将产砖三亿块。现在，集体农庄的联合委员会又增添汽车二百二十辆和各种设备四千五百套。
    在乌克兰的斯大林州，成立了二十个集体农庄的联合建筑机构。它们已开始兴建十三座集体农庄合用的水泥、矿渣、砖瓦厂。今年，砌墙材料和屋面材料的产量将增加50％至100％。新的采石场正在开采中。在集体农庄合办的企业里，设有专为培养各种建设人员的训练班。
    集体农庄不仅建设住宅和本农庄生产所必需的建筑物，而且也兴建公用的建筑物：学校、医院、幼儿园、托儿所等。例如阿尔泰边区有分布广阔的学校网。荒地征服者在这方面作出了巨大的贡献。当地集体农庄用自己的资金兴建了二百多所学校，其中约半数已于1958年秋天建成。
    在库隆达草原和阿尔泰山区今年仍然大规模兴建校舍。集体农庄今年用自己的资金新建一百多所学校、工作室和寄宿学校。农庄拨出数百万卢布用来建筑农村青年夜校、作坊等。
    在俄罗斯联邦共和国东南部的奔隆州的集体农庄于1958年建筑了约一百座俱乐部，数十座农村阅览室、图书馆、红角等。今年，他们将兴建更多的新的文化基地。　（伊格）（附图片）
