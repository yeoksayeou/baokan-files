Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report delivered at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and guided by the general line of socialist construction, our country's various ethnic groups have achieved a series of great accomplishments. All nationalities throughout the country are united around the Communist Party, advancing vigorously on the socialist path, and various undertakings have achieved rapid development. Our people have fundamentally changed the face of the old society, and the material and cultural life of the people has been significantly improved on the basis of developing production. I would like to report on my observations during my visit to the Honghe Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province:

The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province is located on the border of Yunnan. It is a multi-ethnic area (fourteen ethnic groups, forty branches), with good climate conditions and complex terrain (altitude ranging from eighty meters to two thousand six hundred meters). It is rich in resources. In addition to producing tin, it also produces coal, lead, copper, iron, and other rare metals, totaling forty-odd kinds. The prefecture governs eight counties, including Jianchuan, Shiping, Mile, Honghe, Luchun, Hekou, Jinping, and Yuanyang, as well as Gejiu City, totaling over 1.88 million people (approximately 900,000 Han people, 340,000 Yi people, 280,000 Hani people, and approximately 360,000 people from the other eleven ethnic groups). There are over 3.5 million mu of cultivated land.

During this inspection, after listening to the introductions of the local Party and government leaders, and visiting some factories, mines and people's communes in the "Tin Capital" Gejiu, it became clear that since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the state has completed a series of social reforms and construction work. It has achieved significant success in all aspects of ethnic work, industrial and agricultural production, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, fundamentally changing the extremely poor and backward state of the past, and the people's lives have greatly improved. At present, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire state continue to exert revolutionary energy, and are confidently striving to continue the great leap forward and complete or over fulfill various tasks for 1959.

In terms of ethnic work

In accordance with the Party's ethnic policy and the provisions of the National Constitution, and under the principle of ensuring national unity and achieving ethnic equality, the ethnic work in the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture has also made great progress. It has successfully completed democratic reform and socialist transformation, and on this basis, it has realized the people's commune system. An unprecedented unity and cooperation have emerged among all ethnic groups, with sincere mutual assistance, mutual love, mutual encouragement, mutual learning, and unity of purpose, enabling the smooth completion of democratic reform, socialist transformation, and various construction tasks. The Datun Rocket People's Commune in Gejiu City has two poems:

One poem:

	What a Datun dam, the Miao people dare not come down,
	Firstly, they fear the insatiable landlords who eat people,
	Secondly, they fear the ruling class tearing apart their homes,
	They can only hide in the mountain ravines day and night for generations.

Another poem:

	What a Datun dam, every ethnicity is one family,
	Men and women, young and old, work together, joyfully planting flowers of happiness.

These two poems contrastingly depict the Miao people's lives in the old and new societies, describe the victory of the Communist Party's ethnic policy, and showcase the bright and beautiful prospects.

The following are two specific and vivid reflections from two farmers:

Yi ethnic old farmer Li Changjiu said: "Before liberation, I owed more than 200,000 yuan in high-interest loans for a long time. My clothes were ragged, I had no bedding, and I was always short of food. I often dared not come down from the mountains. After liberation, I was emancipated. My family of seven now has two sets of new clothes each, a clock, and a bicycle. We also have more than 400 yuan in the bank." Miao ethnic woman Li Baoying said: "Life now is hundreds of times better than before. Before liberation, I had no money to make shoes. They even said that the Miao people were not supposed to wear shoes. In the past, the reactionaries said that 'when the peach blossoms bloom, the Miao people move,' meaning that when spring came, the good places were to be given to them. Now that we have Chairman Mao, the Miao people will never move again. In the past, the Miao people cut firewood in the mountains to sell to maintain their lives. Now that we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to establish our own people's commune, life is getting better day by day. Now, not only can we afford to wear shoes, but we also have money to buy our favorite shoes. We have made new clothes, built new houses, made furniture, and also saved money in the bank."

In the Yuanyang area, it was recently discovered that there are still "Kucong" people living a primitive life, wearing clothes made of leaves, and cultivating land in a very rudimentary way. This ethnic group has more than 3,000 people. Under the care and attention of the Party and the government, some have already settled down the mountain and learned to cultivate and live a new life. This ethnic group will directly transition from a primitive society to a socialist society in the big family of the motherland, under the leadership of the Party.

These vivid facts concretely reflect the victory of the Party's ethnic policy, reflect the love and support of the people of all ethnic groups for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the People's Government, and the Party's ethnic policy, and reflect that they are truly developing rapidly.

In terms of industrial production

In 1957, the state had 350 industrial factories and mines including tin mines, electric power, machinery, textiles, coal, food, and chemicals (excluding the figures of Yunnan Tin Corporation, same below). In 1958, this number increased to 1,764, and the number of employees also increased from 23,507 to 113,257. The industrial output value increased from 57.2 million yuan in 1957 to 229.45 million yuan. The 17 factories and mines affiliated with Yunnan Tin Corporation (39,400 employees) overfulfilled the state plan for tin production in 1958 by 11.77 percent, an increase of 24.2 percent compared to 1957. The industrial output value increased by 30.1 percent compared to 1957. The industrial output value of the Mengzi United Society also increased from 4.17 million yuan in 1957 to 7.73 million yuan, an increase of 85.3 percent. There has also been a great leap forward in basic construction. For example, Yunnan Tin Corporation overfulfilled the leap forward plan approved by the state for 1958 by 15.77 percent. In 1958, a certain amount of manpower and material resources were also organized and invested in the movement to produce steel, iron, and copper on a large scale, with more than 20,000 tons of steel and iron smelted. In order to continue the great leap forward, the production plan for tin in 1959 is to increase by 17.2 percent compared to 1958; steel, steel materials, lead, tungsten, fuel, etc. will also have corresponding development.

In terms of agricultural production

In 1958, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the people of the entire state relied on the strength of the masses to overcome the major drought that had not occurred in the state for more than 40 years, lasting more than nine months, as well as natural disasters such as floods and insects, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. This would have been unimaginable in the old society.

In terms of grain, more than 3.92 million mu of major and minor spring grain crops were planted (some areas were replanted), producing 1.6691 billion jin of grain, an increase of 60 percent compared to 1957. From the perspective of Jianchuan County, the state supplied the county with 3 million jin of grain in 1957. In 1958, in addition to achieving self-sufficiency, it also transferred 6 million jin to support industrial construction. However, from the perspective of the entire state, the border areas grew more, the inland areas grew less, and individual areas experienced a decline in production. In terms of cash crops, there has also been great development. Taking sugarcane as an example, 80,000 mu were planted in 1958, doubling the planting area compared to 1957, with a yield of more than 8,000 jin per mu, an increase of two times compared to 1957.

In 1959, measures such as improving cultivation techniques, improving soil, applying more fertilizer, and carefully selecting seeds are planned to increase the yield per unit area, and it is planned to produce 3 billion jin of grain. According to the statistics of March 25, 9,344 mu of early rice, 512,399 mu of early-maturing crops such as corn and potatoes have been planted. It is planned to plant 100,000 mu of sugarcane, an increase of 25 percent compared to 1958, and to increase the planting of cotton by 80,000 mu. There will also be increases in flue-cured tobacco, peanuts, etc.

In terms of water conservancy construction, great achievements were also made in 1958. According to statistics from last October to this February, the state built 19,660 large, medium, and small water conservancy projects, dug 8,008 ponds, dug 13,180 wells, spent 7.38 million labor workdays, completed 13,184,200 cubic meters of earthwork, completed 189,439,800 cubic meters of waterwork, and added 97,958,800 cubic meters of water, an increase of 165.9 percent compared to the same period last year. Many of the projects are huge and exciting. For example, Jianchuan County overcame many difficulties and built a 130-kilometer long leap forward canal (not yet completed), which can irrigate about 70 percent of the cultivated area in the county. The Mengzi United Society in Gejiu City opened up countless cliffs and steep walls, and passed through 34 tunnels (3,769 meters long), and built a labor-peasant canal that was more than 80 kilometers long, which had never been seen in the county before. It has been basically completed, benefiting an area of ​​about 200,000 mu. After the project is fully completed, it can not only basically solve the water problem in this area, but also support industrial and mining water, and it can also build three small power stations (totaling 2,200 kW). The construction of these canals played a decisive role in combating drought, preventing floods, and ensuring a bumper harvest in the major drought that had not seen a drop of rain for more than nine consecutive months in 1958 and the major floods that had not occurred for decades. This year, even if it does not rain, the state can guarantee the planting of about 300,000 mu of cultivated land in addition to the original paddy fields. According to incomplete statistics, this year, 800,000 mu of minor spring crops can still be irrigated one to five times, which strongly guarantees the growth of minor spring crops and lays a solid foundation for the great leap forward in agriculture in 1959.

In 1959, it is planned to mobilize 628,915 laborers to build 49,662 large and small water conservancy projects. After completion, it can irrigate an additional 900,295 mu of cultivated land, which can basically change the situation in these areas where production has been affected by natural disasters such as drought, insects, and floods over the years, and make agricultural crops achieve a greater harvest.

In terms of sideline production: It is also necessary to develop at a high speed in 1959. The state plans to raise 1.5 million pigs (currently 600,000), striving for one per person. The production of other chickens, ducks, and vegetables will also be vigorously developed to achieve self-raising, self-planting, and self-eating, and to support industrial and mining areas. This will not only change the past situation of relying on external allocation, but also have a great effect on consolidating the worker-peasant alliance politically and economically.

In terms of cultural, educational and health undertakings

Before liberation, this area was called an uncivilized and unhealthy area. The Hani people have an old saying: "Ants don't cross the river, partridges don't climb trees, Hani people don't read books, there are flowers but no pots to plant them," which shows that ethnic minorities are eager to learn, but they don't have the opportunity to learn. In the past few years since liberation, they have also turned over in culture, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings have greatly developed. According to understanding, in 1951, the state had only 1,008 middle (one normal school) and primary schools, with 70,524 students, and only a small number of students were children of ethnic minorities and workers and peasants of various ethnic groups. As of 1958, the number of public schools in the state has doubled, increasing to 2,017, and the number of students has increased more than threefold, to 211,740. In 1958, four schools including Yunnan Southern Workers and Peasants University (including teacher training college), Industrial Technical School, Agricultural School, and Health School were also established, with a total of 1,693 students. Since the Great Leap Forward, 37 private middle schools have been established, with an enrollment of 1,858 students. Among the students in middle and primary schools, the children of workers and peasants account for about 80 to 90 percent; the number of students of ethnic minorities has also greatly increased. For example, in Jinping County, ethnic minority students only accounted for 33 percent of the total number of students at the time of liberation. Last year, it increased to 71 percent. In Yuanyang County, the number of ethnic minority students also increased from 9 percent before liberation to 41 percent in 1958. The number of teachers of all ethnic groups in the state also increased to 3,638 by 1958.

The establishment of these schools has not only popularized culture and education in the brotherly ethnic regions, but will also cultivate more construction talents for the country and serve socialist construction.

Health and healthcare undertakings have also greatly developed, which has played a great role in preventing and treating diseases and reducing mortality. At present, the state has 16 state-run hospitals at the state and county levels, 224 commune-run hospitals (clinics), and 99 state-run hospitals in industrial and mining enterprises. These hospitals have 1,409 medical personnel on staff and 2,530 rural health workers; the state has 171 doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, 3,461 folk "herbal doctors" (local name for doctors who specialize in treating one or several diseases), 18,018 childcare workers, and 1,205 midwives.

In terms of collective welfare: It has developed at a high speed since the Great Leap Forward and the realization of the people's commune system. According to understanding, the state established 6,850 public canteens in 1958; 6,330 nurseries and kindergartens, with 130,835 children enrolled; 172 homes for the elderly, with 2,144 elderly people living in them. This has not only improved the lives of the people, but also greatly liberated the productive forces, especially the labor force of the vast number of women, freeing them from the shackles of housework for thousands of years, allowing all people with labor to actively participate in labor within their capabilities, making the best use of their talents, giving full play to their enthusiasm for labor, and contributing to socialist construction. For example, after 2,223 members of the Yangjiazhai Production Management District of the Datun Rocket People's Commune participated in the collective canteen, only 183 people were needed to cook, saving 2,040 labor forces. Originally, more than 290 women often stayed at home to take care of their children. After the establishment of nurseries, 48 people solved the problem, saving more than 240 people. The people's communes sent the helpless, unsupported, elderly and disabled people to the homes for the elderly. This is the meticulous care and attention of the Party and the government to them, which they could not have dreamed of during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

Improved lives, even greater enthusiasm

With the development of production, the income of laborers has increased, their lives have greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production has become even higher. For example, the average monthly income of employees in Yunnan Tin Corporation is more than 60 yuan, and the average income of members of the Datun Rocket People's Commune in 1958 was 115 yuan, which greatly improved their living standards. In addition to living expenses, many members (employees) also have savings, with some depositing more than 400 yuan in the bank. They reflected: "After liberation, we not only turned over and were allocated land, but we also established cooperatives and people's communes. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao also led us to build so many water conservancy projects, overcome the major drought that had not occurred in 40 years and natural disasters such as floods and insects, and achieved a bumper harvest. In the old society, we ordinary people would not only not be able to eat grain under such circumstances, but we would not even be able to find grass roots to eat, and we would not know how many people would starve to death." An Yi commune member from the Rocket Commune said, "Before liberation, we lived a very miserable life. We worked for landlords, never had enough to eat or wear, and eventually the whole family scattered and fled. After liberation, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we not only turned over and had food and clothing, but we also lived a very good life. Now we are working harder and harder, and we want to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with practical actions to improve production." Due to the improvement of living standards, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been further enhanced. More than 97 percent of the labor force in the Rocket People's Commune actively participate in production. The workers of the Yunnan Tin Corporation Machinery Factory are unwilling to rest for several weeks. Fearing that they are too tired, the leaders repeatedly mobilize them, but they still refuse and secretly go to work behind the leaders' backs. On the water conservancy project, they are working hard, practically and cleverly with a hundred times more confidence, with a selfless spirit, working day and night on the front line. Especially after implementing the spirit of the six-level meeting, their energy has been further boosted. Some proposed: "We must listen to the Party's words, and do whatever we are asked to do, and ensure the completion of the task." Some commune members proposed: One person must plant 12 mu of land, and guarantee a yield of 600 jin per mu. Some want to start their own experimental fields, and want to challenge other regions, and guarantee to complete the 1959 production tasks to answer the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership and care for them. The members of the Rocket Commune also said, "The worker elder brothers helped us build water pumps and repair ditches, so that our production is guaranteed. We must use the practical actions of raising more pigs and growing more vegetables to support them." Their slogan is: "Raise more, plant more, eat less, and support more." In the discussion, the farmers all said: "We will not eat vegetables for a month, and we will not eat meat for three months, but we must guarantee the supply to the worker elder brothers."

In short, the achievements made by the state in all aspects in 1958 are remarkable and great. Not only has there been great improvement in the economic and cultural aspects, but also a new situation has emerged in the political aspect. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups are more closely united. The relationship between the Party and the masses and the relationship between workers and peasants has become closer, and the communist consciousness of the people has also greatly improved. All of these are the political foundation for realizing the great leap forward in 1958 and striving for a continued leap forward in 1959.

How to continue to move forward

Although the Honghe Autonomous Prefecture has made the above-mentioned great achievements in the Great Leap Forward, there is still greater potential to be tapped after the people are fully mobilized and the labor force is well organized, and there are more complex natural disasters that need to be prevented and controlled. I would like to offer the following immature opinions:

1. Continue to vigorously build water conservancy projects, complete all possible reservoirs, canals, and pond projects, gradually eliminate droughts and floods, turn floods into water conservancy, turn droughts into harvests, and use water conservancy to build large and small hydropower stations.

2. Strengthen the tool reform movement. The places where more labor and labor intensity are used for harvesting, sowing, watering, transportation, and deep plowing should continue to mobilize the masses to reform tools, so that farmland cultivation methods gradually move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization, and make transportation vehicle-based and vehicle ball-bearing based.

3. Strengthen ore dressing and smelting technology, improve equipment, and gradually prevent the loss of all accompanying rare metal minerals.

4. In order to develop the industrial and mining areas of the autonomous prefecture, the railway in the Mile coal mining area should be quickly built to Kaiyuan, so as to connect the tin mines in the "Tin Capital" Gejiu, the iron mines in Shiping, and the coal mines in Mile. The existing railways in Shiping and Gejiu should also be rebuilt to speed up the operation and meet the needs of mass transportation.

5. Strengthen safety measures at construction sites to protect the health of workers. In particular, the safety protection of mining tunnels, cableways, blasting operations, and workshop lathes in mining areas must be further strengthened. The water used in the washing and selection workshop must be further organized, and the light must be further enhanced.

6. Continue to eliminate the eight pests, pay attention to hygiene, and strictly prevent and control diseases. Yunnan is located on the border, with a mild climate and poor natural disinfection and sterilization power. Therefore, diseases continue to occur, often causing long-term spread of epidemics, which poses a great threat to people's life safety and the deployment and coordination of labor. This requires launching a mass hygiene movement to eliminate disease sources, prevent diseases, and the Datun Rocket People's Commune needs fly swatters. After the suggestion, the masses were called upon to rush to make more than 3,000 of them overnight. This positive spirit is commendable.

7. The Honghe Autonomous Prefecture not only has many barren mountains that can be afforested, but also has not enough trees in the wide dams, along the long roads, around many villages and towns, and in front of and behind houses. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to plant trees and afforest on a large scale. In 1958 and previous years, although many trees have been planted, the survival rate of trees was extremely low last year due to the severe drought in this area. This year, Jianchuan County planted 2.5 million garden fruit trees, and plans to plant an average of 100 various trees per person, which is commendable.

8. After the tempering of the rectification movement and the practice of economic and cultural construction, the political awareness of the various ethnic minorities is constantly improving. They have now fully realized that the unity of the motherland and the unity among the various ethnic groups are the highest interests of the various ethnic groups, and they realize that only by taking the socialist road can ethnic equality and the common development of the various ethnic groups be fully realized. But don't forget the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek gang and secret agents. They will not be willing to fail. They are trying every possible means to sabotage and to provoke unity among ethnic groups. Therefore, in the border areas with many ethnic groups, we should continuously strengthen ethnic work, correctly implement the Party's ethnic policy, resolutely crack down on the instigation and alienation of bad elements, and achieve the sincere unity of all ethnic groups.

The above reported situation and my personal views are inevitably one-sided and erroneous. Please criticize and correct me, Chairman and fellow delegates.

I wish the conference success! I wish all delegates good health!

### 红河自治州日新月异  赵熔委员的发言

1959-05-07
第14版()
专栏：

　　红河自治州日新月异
    赵熔委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告以及李维汉副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的指导下，取得了一系列的伟大成就。全国各民族团结在共产党的周围，正以豪迈的步伐在社会主义大道上生气勃勃地前进着，各项事业获得了日新月异的发展。我国人民已从根本上改变了旧社会的面貌，在发展生产的基础上，人民的物质文化生活有了显著的改善。现仅就视察云南红河自治州工作情况作如下汇报：
    云南省红河哈尼族、彝族自治州，地处云南边疆，为多民族地区（十四种民族，四十个支系），气候条件良好，地形复杂（拔海八十公尺到二千六百公尺），物产丰富，除产大锡外，还产煤、铅、铜、铁及其它稀有金属四十来种。全州辖建水、石屏、弥勒、红河、绿春、河口、金平、元阳等八个县和个旧市，计一百八十八万余人（汉族约九十万人，彝族三十四万人，哈尼族二十八万余人，其它十一个民族共约三十六万余人），共有耕地三百五十多万亩。
    在这次视察中，听了当地党政领导同志的介绍，参观访问了“锡都”个旧的部分厂矿及某些人民公社，情况表明，该州自解放以来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下完成了一系列的社会改革和建设工作，在民族工作、工农业生产和文教卫生事业等各方面都取得了显著的成绩，基本上改变了已往极度贫困、落后的状态，人民生活有了很大的改善。目前全州人民在党的领导下，继续鼓足革命干劲，正信心百倍地为继续的跃进，完成或超额完成一九五九年的各项任务而奋斗。
    民族工作方面
    根据党的民族政策和国家宪法的规定，在保证国家统一，实现民族平等的原则下，红河哈尼族、彝族自治州的民族工作，也有很大发展。已经顺利完成了民主改革和社会主义改造，并且在这个基础上实现了人民公社化。各民族之间出现了空前未有的团结与协作，真诚的互助互爱、互相鼓励、互相学习、团结一致，从而能够顺利地完成民主改革和社会主义改造及各项建设任务。个旧市大屯火箭人民公社有两首诗：
    一首：
    好个大屯坝，苗家不敢下，
    一怕吃人无厌的地主，
    二怕统治阶级拆散我的家，
    只好日日夜夜永辈躲在山凹凹。
    又一首：
    好个大屯坝，各个民族是一家，
    男女老幼齐动手，欢乐同栽幸福花。
    这两首诗对照地描述了旧社会和新社会的苗家生活，描述了共产党的民族政策的胜利，并展示了光明美好的前景。
    下面是两个农民的具体的生动的反映：
    彝族老农李长久说：“解放前长期欠高利贷二十多万元，衣服褴褛、被褥无着，终年粮食缺少，经常不敢下山来；解放后翻了身，一家七口，现都有了两套新衣、一个大钟、一辆自行车，银行还存了四百多元”。苗族妇女李宝英说：“现在生活比以前好了几百倍，解放前没钱作鞋穿，还说苗家不兴穿鞋，过去反动派说我们‘桃子开花，苗子搬家’，这说明春天到了，好的地方要让给他们。现在有了毛主席，苗家永世不搬了。过去苗家在山上砍柴卖，以维持生活，现在有了共产党、毛主席领导我们建立了自己的人民公社，生活是一天天好起来了，现在不仅兴穿鞋，而且也有钱买自己心爱的鞋，我们作了新衣，盖了新房，制了家具，还在银行里存了钱。”
    在元阳地区，近年发现还有过着原始生活的“苦聪”族人民，穿着树叶衣服，耕种极为简陋。这个民族约有三千多人，在党和政府的关怀照顾下，已有部分下山定居，并已学会耕作和过着新的生活。这个民族将在祖国大家庭里，在党的领导下，由原始社会直接过渡到社会主义社会。
    这些生动的事实，具体地反映了党的民族政策的胜利，反映了各族人民对共产党、毛主席和人民政府及党的民族政策的爱戴和拥护，反映了他们真正是在一日千里地向前发展。
    工业生产方面
    一九五七年全州计有锡矿、电业、机械、纺织、煤炭、食品、化学等工业厂矿三百五十个（未包括云锡数字下同），一九五八年增加到一千七百六十四个，职工人数也有二万三千五百零七人增加到十一万三千二百五十七人。工业产值，由一九五七年的五千七百二十万元增长到二亿二千九百四十五万元。云锡所属十七个厂矿（职工三万九千四百人），大锡生产在一九五八年超额百分之十一点七七完成国家计划，比一九五七年增长百分之二十四点二。工业产值比一九五七年增长百分之三十点一。蒙自联社的工业产值也由一九五七年的四百一十七万元增长到七百七十三万元，增长了百分之八十五点三。基本建设方面，也有很大的跃进，如云南锡业公司超额百分之十五点七七完成了一九五八年国家批准的跃进计划。一九五八年还组织了一定数量的人力、物力投入了大炼钢、铁、铜的运动，计炼出钢铁二万余吨。为了继续跃进，一九五九年计划大锡生产比一九五八年增长百分之十七点二；钢、钢材及铅、钨、燃料等也有相应的发展。
    农业生产方面
    一九五八年全州人民在中央和省委的正确领导下，依靠群众力量，战胜了该州四十余年来从未有过的持续九个多月的大旱灾和洪、虫等自然灾害，获得了史无前例的大丰收。这假若在旧社会是不可能想像的。
    在粮食方面，种下大小春粮食作物三百九十二万余亩（有部分面积是复种的），产粮十六亿六千九百一十万斤，比一九五七年增长百分之六十。从建水县情况来看，一九五七年国家供应该县三百万斤粮食，一九五八年除达到自给外，还外调六百万斤支援工业建设。但从全州情况来看，边疆地区增长较多，内地增长较少，个别地区还有减产的情况。在经济作物方面，也有很大的发展，以甘蔗为例，一九五八年种了八万亩，比一九五七年扩大种植面积一倍，每亩产量八千多斤，比一九五七年增长二倍。
    一九五九年计划采取改进耕作技术，改良土壤，多施肥料，精选种子等措施来提高单位面积产量，计划生产粮食三十亿斤；根据三月二十五日的统计，全州已种下早稻九千三百四十四亩，包谷、洋芋等早熟作物五十一万二千三百九十九亩。计划种甘蔗十万亩，比一九五八年增长百分之二十五，增种棉花八万亩。烤烟、花生等也都有所增长。
    水利建设，一九五八年也取得了很大成绩。据去年十月至今年二月统计，全州修建了大中小型各种水利工程一万九千六百六十件，挖塘八千零八个，打井一万三千一百八十眼，出劳动工日七百三十八万个，完成土石方一千三百一十八点四二万立公方，完成水方一亿八千九百四十三点九八万立公方，新增水量九千七百九十五点八八万立公方，比去年同时期增加水量百分之一百六十五点九。有许多工程是巨大的、令人兴奋的，如建水县战胜了重重困难，修建了一条长达一百三十公里的跃进大渠（尚未完工），可灌溉该县百分之七十左右的耕种面积。个旧市蒙自联社打开了无数悬岩绝壁，穿过三十四个隧道（长达三千七百六十九公尺），修通了该县从来未有的长达八十多公里的一条工农大渠，已基本完工，受益面积在二十万亩左右，全部完工后，不仅可基本上解决这个地方的用水，而且可以支援工矿用水，同时还可建立三个小型的发电站（计二千二百瓩）。这些水渠的修建，对一九五八年连续九个多月未下一滴雨的大旱灾和几十年没有过的大洪灾起到了抗旱、防洪和保证丰收的决定作用。今年全州不下雨也可保证除原有水田外三十万亩左右的耕地栽插。据不完全统计，今年有八十万亩小春作物还可得到一至五次的灌溉，有力地保证了小春作物的成长，为一九五九年的农业大跃进打下了稳固的基础。
    一九五九年计划抽调六十二万八千九百一十五个劳动力，修建四万九千六百六十二件大小水利工程，待完工后，可增灌九十万零二千二百九十五亩耕地，基本上可改变这些地区历年因干旱、虫、洪等自然灾害而影响生产的情况，使农作物获得更大的丰收。
    副业生产方面：一九五九年也要高速度的发展，全州计划养猪一百五十万头（现有六十万头），争取每人一头，其它鸡、鸭及蔬菜等生产也要大力发展，达到自养、自种、自食并支援工矿区，这样不仅改变过去依靠外地调拨的情况，更从政治上、经济上对巩固工农联盟有很大的作用。
    文教卫生事业方面
    解放前，这个地区被称为不文明的和烟瘴地区。哈尼族有句古话：“蚂蚁不过河，鹧鸪不上树，哈尼族不读书，有花无盆栽”，这说明少数民族是好学的，但得不到学习的机会。解放几年来，他们在文化方面也来了一个翻身，文教卫生事业，有很大发展。据了解一九五一年全州仅有中、（一个师范）小学校一千零八所，学生七万零五百二十四人，且少数民族子弟和各族的工农子弟的学生为极少数。截至一九五八年公办学校已在全州翻了一番，增加到二千零一十七所，学生增长三倍多，为二十一万一千七百四十人。一九五八年还举办了滇南工农大学（内含师专）、工业技术学校、农校、卫校等四个学校，计学生一千六百九十三人。大跃进以来，又办了三十七个民办中学，入学人数达一千八百五十八名。在中、小学校学生中，工农子弟占百分之八十至九十左右；少数民族子弟学生人数也有很大增加，如金平县在解放时少数民族子弟学生仅占学生总数百分之三十三，去年已增至百分之七十一，元阳县的少数民族子弟学生，亦由解放前的百分之九，增加到一九五八年的百分之四十一。各民族教师至一九五八年全州也增长到三千六百三十八人。
    这些学校的建立，不仅在兄弟民族地区普及了文化教育，并将为国家培养出更多的建设人材，为社会主义建设服务。
    卫生保健事业也有很大发展，对防治疾病，减少死亡都起到了很大的作用。目前全州计有州、县一级公办医院十六个，公社民办医院（所）二百二十四个，工矿企业公办医院九十九个。这些医院计有在职医务人员一千四百零九人，农村保健人员二千五百三十人；全州有中医一百七十一人，民间“草医”（当地对专治一种或数种疾病的医生的称呼）三千四百六十一人，保育员一万八千零一十八人，接生员一千二百零五人。
    集体福利事业方面：大跃进以来和人民公社化实现以后，有了高速度的发展。据了解全州一九五八年办起了公共食堂六千八百五十个；托儿所、幼儿园六千三百三十个，入托
  （园）十三万零八百三十五个儿童；敬老院一百七十二个，入院养老者二千一百四十四人。这不仅改善了人民的生活，并且大大地解放了生产力，特别是解放了广大妇女的劳动力，使她们摆脱了几千年来家务劳动的束缚，使所有有劳动力的人都积极地参加了力所能及的劳动，做到了人尽其才，发挥了劳动积极性，在社会主义建设中，贡献了力量。如大屯火箭人民公社杨家寨生产管理区二千二百二十三户社员参加集体食堂后，只需一百八十三人做饭菜，节省了劳动力二千零四十个。原来经常有二百九十多个妇女在家领小孩，托儿化后，有四十八人就解决了，节省了二百四十多人。对那些无依无靠，无人抚养的老年人和残废者，公社化后，把他们送进了敬老院，这是党和政府对他们无微不至的关怀与照顾，是他们在国民党反动统治时期所梦想不到的。
    生活改善，干劲更高
    随着生产的发展，劳动者的收入增加了，生活有了很大的改善，生产积极性更加高涨了。如云锡这个厂矿，职工收入平均每人每月在六十元以上，大屯火箭人民公社社员一九五八年每人平均收入一百一十五元，大大地提高了他们的生活水平。不少社员（职工）除生活用费外，还有节余，有的在银行存款四百元以上。他们反映说：“解放后，我们不仅翻了身，分得了土地，而且还建立了合作社和人民公社，共产党和毛主席又领导我们修了这么多的水利，战胜了四十年来未有过的大旱灾和洪、虫等自然灾害，获得了丰收，要是在旧社会，我们老百姓在这种情况下不但吃不到粮食，就是草根也找不到吃，不知要饿死多少人哩”。火箭公社彝族社员说：“解放前，我们过着十分悲惨的生活，给地主干活，终日吃不饱穿不暖，最后搞得一家大小东逃西散。解放后，有了共产党、毛主席的领导，我们不仅翻了身，有吃有穿，而且生活过得很好。现在生产越干越有劲，要用搞好生产的实际行动来感谢共产党和毛主席。”由于生活提高了，群众的生产积极性更加提高，火箭人民公社的社员百分之九十七以上的劳动力都积极参加了生产，云锡机械厂的工人几个礼拜都不愿休息，恐他们过于疲劳，领导上再三动员，他们仍是不肯，却背着领导去工作。在水利工程上他们正以百倍信心，苦干、实干、巧干，以忘我的精神，夜以继日的不下火线。尤其是贯彻六级会议精神后，更加鼓足了干劲。有的提出说：“一定要听党的话，叫干那样就干那样，保证完成任务。”有的社员提出：自己一个人要种十二亩地，保证亩产六百斤。有的要自搞试验田，并且要向其他地区挑战，保证完成一九五九年的生产任务来回答党和毛主席对他们的领导与关怀。火箭公社的社员还说：“工人老大哥帮助我们建水泵、修水沟，使我们生产有保障，我们要用多养猪，多种菜的实际行动去支援他们。他们的口号是：“多养、多种、少吃、大支援。”在座谈中，农民们俱说：“一个月不吃菜，三个月不吃肉，也要保证供应工人老大哥。”
    总之，一九五八年该州在各方面所取得的成绩是显著的、伟大的。不仅在经济、文化方面有了很大的改进，在政治方面也出现了新的局面，各族人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下更加亲密团结了。党群关系、工农关系，更加密切了，人民群众的共产主义觉悟也有了很大的提高，所有这些又都是实现一九五八年大跃进争取一九五九年继续跃进的政治基础。
    怎样继续前进
    虽然在大跃进中红河自治州有了上述伟大的成绩，但在人民充分动员起来，劳动力很好地加以组织后，还有较大的潜力可挖，还有更复杂的自然灾害需要防治。特提出如下几点不成熟的意见：
    1．继续大力兴修水利，完成一切可以修建的水库、沟渠、池塘工程，逐渐杜绝旱灾与洪灾，变洪灾为水利，变旱灾为丰收，并利用水利建设大小水电站。
    2．加强改革工具运动，收获、播种、浇水、运输以及深翻土地等使用劳动力多、劳动力强度大的地方，都应继续发动群众改革工具，使农田耕作方法逐渐走向半机械化、机械化，并使运输车子化，车子滚珠轴承化。
    3．加强选矿和冶炼技术，改善设备，逐渐做到防止一切附带稀有金属矿的丢失。
    4．为了发展自治州的矿区工业，应迅速把弥勒煤矿区的铁路修到开远，以便把“锡都”个旧的锡矿、石屏的铁矿和弥勒的煤矿连接起来，石屏、个旧的现有铁道，亦应加以改建，以加速运转速度，适应大量运输的需要。
    5．加强工地的安全措施，保障工人的健康，尤其矿区的坑道、索道、爆破作业和车间的车床等须进一步的加强安全防护，洗选车间的用水须加以进一步的整理，光线须进一步加以增强。
    6．继续消灭八害、讲求卫生、严格防治病患，云南地处边疆，气候温和，大自然的消毒灭菌力较差，因此病症不断发生，往往引起流行病长期蔓延，对人的生命安全和劳动力的调配协作威胁很大，这就更需要发动群众性的卫生运动以消灭病源、预防病患，大屯火箭人民公社需要蝇拍，经建议后即号召群众一个夜间赶制出三千多个，这种积极精神是可贵的。
    7．红河自治州，不仅还有许多荒山可以造林，即在广阔的坝子里，漫长的公路两旁，很多的村镇周围，住宅前后，树木也不够多，应该发动群众，大量植树、造林。一九五八年及其以前的年代里，虽已栽树不少，但由于这个地区，去年因大旱成灾，树木的成活率极低。今年建水县所栽植林园果树二百五十万株外，每人平均还栽各种树木一百株的计划，是值得赞扬的。
    8．各少数民族，经过整风运动的锻炼和经济文化建设的实践，政治觉悟程度正在不断提高，现已充分认识到祖国的统一和各民族间的团结，是各民族的最高利益，认识到只有走社会主义的道路，才能彻底实现民族平等和各民族共同发展。但是不要忘记帝国主义者和蒋匪帮、特务分子，他们是不会甘心失败的。他们正在千方百计的进行破坏，来挑拨民族间的团结，因此在多民族的边疆，应不断加强民族工作，正确的贯彻党的民族政策，坚决打击坏分子的挑拨离间，作到各民族的真诚团结。
    以上汇报的情况及我个人的看法，难免有片面的、错误的地方，请主席、各位委员批评指正。
    祝大会成功！祝全体委员健康！
