To meet the needs of the great development of fruit trees, our farm, under the leadership of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, relied on the masses to innovate technology, and the work of raising fruit tree seedlings in 1958 has greatly developed. Among them, 145 jin of spring-sown crabapple produced 1,540,000 seedlings, with an average of 10,600 seedlings per jin of seeds (a portion of the seedlings died after transplanting). Currently, the average thickness of crabapple seedlings is 0.8-1.5 cm, and the average height is 2-2.5 chi. The grafting rate of direct-seeded seedlings in the same year reached 95%, the transplanted seedlings reached 70%, the grafting survival rate was 92%, and more than 95% could be released from the nursery in two years. Now, we will introduce the measures we have taken as follows:

    1. First, Let the Roots Grow Well

    To grow good seedlings, you must first have good roots. Deep plowing in the nursery can promote root development and improve seedling quality. Our farm's nursery land is generally plowed three times and harrowed six times before sowing; the first shallow plowing is to eliminate stubble, the second time is to use a double-wheeled double-furrow plow to deep plow seven to nine cun, and apply 5,000 to 8,000 jin of compost per mu (containing 20%-30% stable manure), and then plow a third time. Ensure that the plowing is not repeated or missed and is deep, and that the edges and corners of the field are plowed. To ensure that the nursery land has a good soil structure, increase fertility, and reduce pests and diseases, most of our farm's nursery land implements crop rotation. The previous crops of crabapple land are sweet potatoes, soybeans, green manure, and other crops.

    2. Let the Seedlings Not Be Waterlogged or Droughted

    Ninety percent of the nursery land for cultivating crabapple is transformed from paddy fields. According to the calculation of the maximum rainfall, a drainage system combining large and small ditches was dug and built, which can prevent floods, drain waterlogging, and lower the groundwater level to below 2 meters. The seedbeds are six to eight cun high and the ditches are 1.8 chi wide, achieving deep ditches and high ridges, so that the fields are dry after rain. When the seedlings encountered drought for the second time in late July, in order to ensure the normal growth of the seedlings, the masses were immediately mobilized, forces were organized, and irrigation and watering were carried out day and night to ensure the growth of the seedlings.

    3. The Seeds Should Be Good and the Sowing Should Be Early

    After the crabapple seeds were transported to the farm in November 1957, sand storage was immediately adopted to prevent drying and freezing, and to promote full after-ripening of the seeds (one part seeds, one part sand mixed storage, the sand is kept at a certain humidity); at the same time, samples were taken for germination tests to determine the sowing amount, and all crabapple seeds were soaked in 0.3-0.5% potassium permanganate solution for disinfection for two hours before sowing, and then the seeds were taken out and dried before sowing. The soaked seeds germinate quickly, grow vigorously, and generally develop healthily, and no diseases have been found.

    Sowing is carried out in two phases, both using winter sowing. The first phase is from December 9th to 10th, and the second phase is from 18th to 19th. A total of 45.5 mu were sown, and the sowing amount per mu was 3 jin or 3.5 jin depending on the seed germination rate. Four rows of strip sowing are adopted, the bed is four chi wide, and the length is not fixed, about three to five zhang. In order to facilitate grafting management, the row spacing is five cun - eight cun - fourteen cun - eight cun - five cun. Cover with grass immediately after sowing to keep moisture and prevent cold, cover with grass while sowing, using 400 to 500 jin of grass per mu.

    4. Transplant Seedlings in a Timely Manner and Topdress in Stages

    The winter-sown crabapple seeds began to sprout on February 1st, emerged on the 20th, and 80% emerged by March 11th. The first transplanting was carried out on April 15th when the seedlings were 1.5 to 2 cun high, and the seedlings were finalized by late May. Seedlings are fixed at a plant spacing of 3.5 to 4 cun, leaving more than 10,000 plants per mu. The transplanting period is best when the seedlings have grown two or three true leaves, and the survival rate can reach up to 90%. The survival rate of transplants in mid-to-late May is only 50%. It is best to transplant seedlings on cloudy or rainy days. If it is sunny or a long-distance transplant, pay attention to watering first, not hurting the roots, bringing more soil, and watering and shading after planting.

    According to observations, from May to September, crabapple seedlings have three growth peaks and two stops in growth. Therefore, this farm combined with the growth law of crabapple to carry out multiple topdressing in stages to accelerate the growth of seedlings. The first fertilizer for promoting seedlings was applied in mid-May, with 5 to 8 dan of human manure per mu, the second time in mid-June, with 8 to 10 dan per mu, and another 10 dan in mid-to-late September. 15 to 20 jin of powdered ammonium sulfate was applied in August, mastering thin application and frequent application to make the seedlings reach a certain height early. From mid-July, seedlings above 1.5 chi were successively topped to promote thickening growth, improve the number of budding, and make 95% of the seedlings sown in the same year reach the budding standard (above 1.5 chi in height and above 0.5 cm in thickness).

    5. Prevent and Control Diseases and Insect Pests in a Timely Manner

    Throughout the entire growth period of crabapple, according to the spirit of "prevention is more important than cure, and prevention and cure are equally emphasized", vigorously prevent and control diseases and insect pests. For example, capturing ground tigers from late April to early May, and continuously killing scarab beetles for 40 days from mid-June to early September. Using 160 to 200 times of 6% wettable "666" and other agents to control leaf rollers and wax moths has a good effect. After finding damping-off, use ferrous sulfate to water the roots (concentration 1-3%), and the disease is quickly stopped.

　　一斤海棠种　生产万株苗
　　南京农场
    为了适应果树大发展对果苗的需要，我场在中共南京市委领导下，依靠群众革新技术，1958年的果树育苗工作有了很大发展。其中春播海棠一百四十五斤，成苗一百五十四万株，平均每斤种子出苗一万零六百株（移植后有一部分苗木死亡），目前海棠苗一般粗度为零点八——一点五公分，平均高度为二——二点五度。直播苗当年嫁接率达95％，移植苗达70％，嫁接成活率92％，95％以上能两年出圃。现将我们所采取的措施介绍如后：
    一、先要让根生长好
    要长好苗，必先要有好根。苗圃深耕可以促进根系发育，提高苗木质量。我场苗圃地一般在播种前耕三次，耙六次；第一次浅耕灭茬，第二次利用双轮双铧犁深耕七到九寸，每亩施堆肥五千到八千斤（含20％—30％厩肥）然后耕第三遍。做到耕翻不重不漏翻得深，田边地角都耕到。为了保证苗圃地有良好的土壤结构，增加肥力，并减少病虫为害，我场苗圃地大部分实行轮作。海棠地的前茬为山芋、黄豆、绿肥等作物。
    二、让苗不受涝不受旱
    培育海棠的苗圃地，90％都是利用水田改造的，根据最大一次降雨量计算，挖建了大沟小沟相结合的排水系统，可以防洪、排涝，降低地下水位到2公尺以下。苗床高六到八寸，沟宽一点八尺，做到深沟高畦，雨过田干。当7月下旬苗木二次遭遇干旱时，为了保证幼苗正常生长，当即发动群众，组织力量，日夜进行灌溉、浇水，保证了苗木生长。
    三、种子要好播种要早
    1957年11月海棠种子运到场后，即采用沙藏以防干防冻，促进种子充分后熟（一分种子，一分沙混合贮存，沙子保持一定的湿度）；同时抽样进行发芽试验，以确定播种量，并把全部海棠种子于播种前用0.3—0.5％的过锰酸钾溶液浸种，消毒二小时后，将种子取出晾干，即行播种。浸过的种子，发芽快，生长旺，普遍发育健壮，未发现任何病害。
    播种分两期进行，都采取冬播，第一期12月9日至10日，第二期为18—19日。共播种四十五点五亩，每亩播种量，根据种子发芽率不同为三斤或三点五斤。采用四行条播，床宽四尺，长度不拘，约三到五丈。为了便利嫁接管理，行距为五寸—八寸—十四寸—八寸—五寸。播后即盖草，以保潮防寒，边播边盖草，每亩用草四百到五百斤。
    四、移苗适时分期追肥
    冬播的海棠种子于2月1日即开始绽芽，20日出土，3月11日则80％已出齐。4月15日苗高一点五到二寸时进行第一次移苗，至5月下旬定苗。以株距三点五到四寸定苗，每亩留一万余株。移苗期以幼苗生出二三片真叶时为宜，成活率最高可达90％。5月中下旬移的成活率仅占50％。移苗最好利用阴雨天进行，如果晴天或长途移苗，就要注意先泼水，不伤根，多带土，栽后浇水遮荫。
    根据观察，自5月至9月间，海棠苗生长有三次高峰，两度停止生长。因此，本场结合海棠生长规律，进行分期多次追肥，以加速幼苗生长。5月中旬施第一次提苗肥，每亩施人粪尿五到八担，6月中旬第二次，每亩八到十担，9月中下旬再施十担，8月间又施粉状硫酸錏十五到二十斤，掌握薄施、勤施，使苗木提早达到一定高度。自7月中旬开始陆续将一点五尺以上的苗木进行摘心，以促进加粗生长，提高芽接数，使当年播种苗95％达到芽接标准（一点五尺以上高度，及零点五公分以上粗度）。
    五、及时防治病虫害
    在海棠整个生长期内，根据防重于治、防治兼顾的精神，大力防治病虫害。如4月下旬至5月上旬捕捉地老虎，6月中旬至9月上旬连续四十天捕杀金龟子。卷叶虫、毛蜡子用一百六十到二百倍的6％可湿性“六六六”等药剂防治，都有很好效果。发现立枯病后用硫酸亚铁浇根（浓度1—3％），病害迅速制止。
