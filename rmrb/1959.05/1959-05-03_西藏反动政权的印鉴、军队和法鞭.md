    For a long time, the former Tibetan local government cruelly murdered Tibetan people using seals, armies, and law whips. The Tibetan people compared these three things to the three great mountains weighing them down.

    What exactly were the seals, armies, and law whips used by the Tibetan reactionary regime to oppress and harm the Tibetan people for so long? And how did they harm the Tibetan people?

    Let's first talk about the seals of the Tibetan reactionary regime. The Kashag (former Tibetan local government) and its subordinate departments, as well as the old regime institutions of various Dzongs, all had many seals of various sizes. These were the tools of class rule used by the most reactionary big serf owners and senior monks in Tibet to maintain their interests. They controlled the lives and property of the Tibetan people. A popular Tibetan proverb says, "The official seal is as big as a dipper, and the people's blood and sweat flow." One can imagine how much the working people hated the seals of the reactionary regime!

    The Kashag had three seals, the main one engraved with ancient Tibetan characters "Sese Deji," which translates to "May it bring happiness in this world and the next." The Kashag, this reactionary regime, relied on violence and religious pretexts to carry out extremely reactionary and dark rule over the Tibetan people for a long time. Just the Kashag's use of this "Sese Deji" seal brought endless disasters to the Tibetan people!

    As long as one held an official document with a seal, the Tibetan people felt as if "Mount Tai was pressing down on them." Those holding "horse cards" (cards for requisitioning corvée labor) could requisition "Ula" (corvée labor); those holding orders from the Dzong government could apportion taxes. The exorbitant taxes and levies borne by the Tibetan people are hard to believe, said to be more than two hundred kinds. The working people described their painful lives of oppression and enslavement as "shoulders as stirrups, clear water floating at the bottom of the bowl!"

    On the eve of the rebellion plotted by the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, they used these seals of the reactionary regime to issue treasonous orders to various regions and monasteries, brazenly conscripting soldiers and storing grain. Among the upper-class reactionary groups in Tibet, the saying "A-lu-rang-mei" (old system never declines) has been popular for thousands of years. These reactionary and stubborn fellows emphasized following the old rules in everything,妄想 (wangxiang, wild wish) to forever maintain their bloody feudal rule over the vast working people of Tibet. But they were wrong in their calculations. During the suppression of the rebellion in Lhasa, "Sese Deji" and many other criminal seals fell into the hands of the people, waiting to be sent to the historical museum.

    In the past, almost every morning in Lhasa, a military band would appear, banging on dilapidated instruments, followed by some people carrying the drooping "Snow Mountain Lion Flag," staggering along the street. This was the Tibetan army. When the Tibetan army is mentioned, all the people of Tibet grind their teeth in hatred. Their crimes of acting as accomplices to the tiger and oppressing the people are countless.

    The Tibetan army was a group cultivated single-handedly by imperialism. The high and middle-ranking officers of the Tibetan army were almost all trained by the "Zhongzha Maga" (nobility training team) and "Military Training Corps" run by foreigners in Tibet. Some officers had also "studied" at the military school in Darjeeling run by the British. The training and weapons of the Tibetan army were all in a foreign style. The Tibetan army used foreign languages to shout commands, and the band played foreign national anthems and yellow songs popular during the Kuomintang period, such as "Peach Blossom River" and "When Will You Return."

    Under the rule of the former Tibetan local government, this Tibetan army never resisted foreign aggression, nor protected the interests of its own people, but was loyal to its masters—imperialism and the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet. They harmed the Tibetan people, strangled the patriotic and progressive forces in Tibet, and hindered the progress of Tibetan society. For example, they once murdered Living Buddha Reting, attacked patriotic monks in Sera Monastery, prevented the People's Liberation Army from advancing into Qamdo in 1950, and participated in the armed rebellion in Lhasa this time.

    The corruption and depravity of the Tibetan army's military discipline and life are also rarely paralleled. They arbitrarily dispatched "Ula," forcibly occupied civilian houses, drank, fought, gambled, and enjoyed themselves all day long. All food, drink, and expenses were entirely provided by the local people, and they often beat and scolded people if they were slightly dissatisfied. Relying on their evil power, the Tibetan army would also arbitrarily hang a whip in front of the house of a Tibetan woman they fancied. The head of the household had to send his daughter or daughter-in-law, along with the whip, to the Tibetan army's residence. Otherwise, the Tibetan army would send someone to deliver a bullet, meaning that if the woman was not sent, the head of the household would be shot dead with the bullet.

    It was precisely because the Tibetan army was so reactionary and corrupt that when the People's Liberation Army put down the rebellion and eliminated the bandits, the Tibetan people cheered that a great mountain had been removed from their heads.

    Speaking of the law whips of the Tibetan reactionary regime, one cannot help but recall the various terrifying instruments of torture in this feudal fortress. These instruments of torture included various fetters, handcuffs, long cangues, standing cages, eye gouging, and heart-cutting hooks and blades. A stone hat weighing 43.5 jin was one of the instruments of torture for gouging out eyes; the stone hat was placed on a person's head, and then a black cobblestone was used to knock on the stone hat, the eyeballs were pressed out, and then a sharp hook was used to gouge out the eyeballs. Mixed in with the instruments of torture were also dried human hands, human skin, scattered bones, and hair. Anyone who saw these instruments of torture was shocked and furious! In addition to these instruments of torture, there were also so-called law whips. A large pile of law whips was found in Lhasa alone. These law whips were made of cowhide, some twisted together from four strands of cowhide. The leather whips were still stained with blood, and some had been worn smooth, and one did not know how many people had been beaten with them! The former Lhasa Municipal Government (Langzi Xia) specifically employed a group of thugs to beat people with leather whips. The unit composed of these thugs was called "Guo Jiba." These thugs were not only trained, but also held hereditary positions.

    The whips for beating people were often hung in rows in the official government offices and the homes of the great nobles of the former Tibetan local government. As long as commoners, ordinary lamas, servants, and serfs did something that the noble masters considered wrong, they would be beaten. During my years in Tibet, I encountered many Tibetans groaning under the whip.

    Under the dark rule of the former Tibetan local government, demons danced wildly, and the law whips were raised high. People were treated like livestock. There was no justice, let alone truth. Many kind and loyal people were deprived of their lives by the law whips and prisons, enduring great pain! Why shouldn't such an inhuman old system and reactionary regime like poisonous snakes and beasts be destroyed? Why should those who say they "sympathize" with the Tibetan people protect such a regime and reactionary rulers? Are they really "based on emotion and humanitarian reasons"? Anyone who respects the facts a little knows how shameless this lie is. Now, the heroic People's Liberation Army has put down the rebellion in Tibet, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan people will take great strides towards the happy road of socialism, which no one can stop.

    西藏反动政权的印鉴、军队和法鞭
    新华社记者　宗子度
    原西藏地方政府长期以来，利用印鉴、军队和法鞭残酷地杀害藏族人民，藏族人民把这三种东西比作压在他们身上的三座大山。
    西藏反动政权长期压迫残害藏族人民的印鉴、军队和法鞭究竟是些什么玩意？它又是怎样的在残害着西藏人民？
    先谈谈西藏反动政权的印鉴。噶厦（原西藏地方政府）及其所属各部门、各宗溪的旧政权机构都有许多大小印鉴。这些都是西藏最反动的大农奴主和高级僧侣用来保持其利益的阶级统治工具。它掌握着西藏人民的生命财产，西藏流行的谚语说：“官印大如斗，人民血汗流。”可以想见劳动人民对反动政权的印鉴是如何的痛恨！
    噶厦有三颗印鉴，主要的一颗刻着“色细德吉”几个古老的藏文，译意为“在世间和出世间都迪福”。噶厦这个反动政权，凭借暴力和宗教幌子长时期来对西藏人民进行了极为反动的黑暗统治。光是噶厦使用“色细德吉”这颗印鉴就给西藏人民带来了无穷的灾难！
    只要拿着官府的印件，西藏人民就感到有如“泰山压顶”一般。拿着“马牌”（支差役的牌子）的人就可以支取“乌拉”（差役）；拿着宗政府命令的人就可以摊派税款。西藏人民负担的苛捐杂税，说起来令人难以相信，据说有两百多种。劳动人民形容他们被压迫被奴役的痛苦生活是“肩头当马蹬，碗底漂清水！”
    西藏地方政府和上层反动集团图谋叛乱前夕，他们就是使用了这些反动政权的印鉴向各地区，各寺庙下达了叛国命令，悍然征兵屯粮，在西藏上层反动集团中，千百年来一直流行着“阿鲁嚷昧”（旧制不衰）的说法。这些反动、顽固的家伙们事事强调要按照旧规矩，妄想永远保持其对西藏广大劳动人民血腥的封建统治。可是他们打算错了，在拉萨平叛中，“色细德吉”和其他许多罪恶的印鉴都已落入人民手中，等待着送进历史博物馆。
    过去，几乎每天早上，在拉萨城里都要出现一行军乐队敲打着破旧的乐器、后面跟着一些人、撑着低垂的“雪山狮子旗”，蹒蹒跚跚走过大街，这就是藏军。提起藏军，全西藏人民没有不切齿痛恨的，他们为虎作伥，鱼肉人民的罪行已经无法数清。
    藏军是帝国主义一手培养起来的班子，藏军的高级和中级军官差不多全部是由外国人在西藏境内开办的“仲扎马噶”（贵族教练队）和“军事训练团”训练出来的，一部分军官还曾在大吉岭英国人办的军事学校“深造”过。藏军的训练和武器全是一套外国式。藏军用外国语喊口令，乐队奏演的是外国国歌和国民党时期流行的什么“桃花江”、“何日君再来”等黄色歌曲。
    这支藏军在原西藏地方政府统治下，从来不抗御外侮，不保护本民族的利益，而是效忠于豢养他们的主子——帝国主义和西藏上层反动集团。他们残害西藏人民，扼杀西藏爱国进步力量，阻挡西藏社会前进。如他们曾经谋杀热振活佛，攻打色拉寺爱国僧众，1950年阻止人民解放军进军昌都，此次又参加拉萨的武装叛乱等。
    藏军的军纪败坏、生活堕落情况，也是很少比伦的。他们随意支派
  “乌拉”，强占民房，整天酗酒打闹，嫖赌玩乐，一切吃喝用度，完全由当地人民供给，稍不如意，还经常打骂人。藏军还靠着恶势力，随意把马鞭挂在他看中了的藏族妇女的家门前，这户人家的家长就得把自己的女儿或媳妇连同马鞭一起送到藏军的住处去。不然，藏军就会再派人送来一粒子弹，意思是说再不把女人送去，就要用这子弹打死家长。
    正是因为藏军这样反动腐败，所以当解放军平定叛乱，消灭叛乱的匪徒后，西藏人民都欢呼是去掉了他们头上的一座大山。
    谈到西藏反动政权的法鞭，不能不令人想起这个封建堡垒里的各种可怖的刑具。这些刑具有各种脚镣、手铐、长枷、站笼、剜眼、剜心的利钩利刃等。一顶重四十三斤半的石头帽子是剜眼的刑具之一；把石帽子戴在人头上，再用一块乌黑的鹅卵石在石帽子上一敲，眼珠就被压得凸出来，再用锋利的勾子一剜，眼珠就被剜掉了。混在刑具堆里的还有干枯的人手、人皮、杂乱的骨胳和头发，看到这些刑具的人莫不触目惊心，无比愤怒！除这些刑具以外，还有所谓法鞭，仅拉萨城里找到的法鞭就堆了一大堆。这些法鞭是用牛皮做成的，有的是四股牛皮拧在一起，皮鞭上还血迹斑斑，有的已经磨光了，也不知打过多少人！原拉萨市政府
  （郎子辖）专门养了一批用皮鞭打人的打手，打手组成的单位名叫“郭吉巴”，这些打手不但经过训练，而且还是世袭的职业。
    打人的皮鞭，在原西藏地方政府的官府衙门、大贵族家里常常是一排一排地挂着，平民、普通喇嘛、佣人和农奴们只要做了一点在贵族老爷们看来是不对的事情，就要挨一顿鞭子。我在西藏的几年间就曾遇见过不少藏人呻吟在皮鞭下。
    在原西藏地方政府的黑暗统治下，群魔乱舞，法鞭高举，人被当成牲畜一样，没有正义，更谈不上真理。许多善良忠实的人们被法鞭和监狱夺去了生命，忍受着极大的痛苦！这样如毒蛇猛兽一样惨无人道的旧制度和反动政权为什么不应该摧毁呢？那些口口声声说“同情”西藏人民的人，为什么要庇护这样的政权和反动统治者？他们当真是“基于感情和人道原因”吗？只要稍微尊重一点事实的人，就知道这种谎言是如何的无耻。现在，英勇的人民解放军平定了西藏的叛乱，西藏人民在中国共产党的领导下，将迈开大步走向社会主义的幸福道路，这是谁也阻挡不了的。
