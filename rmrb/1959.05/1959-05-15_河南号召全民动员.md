Zhengzhou, May 14th (People's Daily) – Henan Province has comprehensively arranged for the wheat harvest and summer planting, calling on the entire province, the entire Party, and all the people to mobilize, work hard and skillfully for thirty days, conscientiously prepare for the wheat harvest and summer planting, ensure a good wheat harvest, good planting of late autumn crops, and good management of spring-sown crops, laying a solid foundation for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

To ensure the victorious completion of these tasks, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Committee recently studied and formulated a summer harvest and summer planting plan, requiring Party and government leaders at all levels to seize the opportunity, start early, prepare fully, and ensure the victorious completion of the summer harvest and summer planting work.

Regarding preparations for the wheat harvest and summer planting, the plan points out: While continuing to strengthen field management of wheat in the later stages, striving for large ears, many grains, and full grains, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of local material utilization, local production, tapping potential, and self-reliance in tool reform, and quickly launch a tool reform movement centered on reforming summer harvesting tools, and vigorously increase and repair agricultural tools. It is necessary to conscientiously strengthen livestock breeding and management, effectively prevent and control livestock diseases, and strive to fatten and strengthen all weak livestock before the wheat harvest begins. It is required that 5,000 to 7,000 jin of base fertilizer be prepared per mu for summer-sown land before the harvest, and that the opportunity be seized to transport all the base fertilizer for summer-sown crops to the fields and field edges before "Xiaoman" (Lesser Fullness). In addition, the repair work of canals and water lifting tools should be stepped up to give full play to the drainage and irrigation benefits of existing water conservancy projects in the summer harvest and summer planting.

To ensure that there is no loss or spoilage, careful harvesting and threshing, and every grain is returned to the granary during the summer harvest, the plan especially emphasizes the need to conscientiously summarize and promote the experience of local old farmers in quickly threshing and fighting natural disasters such as wind and rain to rush-harvest and rush-thresh in the past. During the wheat harvest, the ripening of wheat should be grasped at any time, harvesting one side as it ripens, and harvesting one piece as it ripens, so as to achieve front cutting and back gleaning, harvesting cleanly; fields should be made on the spot, threshing and storing immediately after harvesting; those that cannot be threshed immediately should be dried and stacked in time to prevent wind and rain from causing mildew and losses.

Regarding summer planting, the plan emphasizes that all localities should ensure the timely completion of the sowing tasks of various crops in accordance with the state plan, striving to plant sufficiently and well. While carrying out the wheat harvest intensively, all localities should rationally organize the labor force to ensure that sowing is done immediately after the harvest, and that the sowing quality is conscientiously improved under the premise of ensuring early sowing. For areas where the spring sowing plan for cash crops such as cotton, oil crops, and flue-cured tobacco has not been completed, efforts should be made to use early stubble land such as fine vegetable stubble, pea stubble, and barley stubble to make up for the shortage. The plan emphasizes that Party and government leaders at all levels must take the summer harvest and summer planting as the overriding central task, with the secretary taking the lead, conscientiously strengthening leadership, fully mobilizing the masses, and quickly launching a high tide of summer harvest and summer planting.

    河南号召全民动员
    本报郑州14日电　河南省全面安排麦收夏种，号召全省全党全民总动员，苦干、巧干三十天，认真搞好麦收夏种准备，保证小麦收好，晚秋作物种好、春播作物管理好，为今年农业全面大丰收打下坚实的基础。
    为保证胜利完成这些任务，中共河南省委、河南省人民委员会在最近研究制定了夏收夏种方案，要求各级党政领导，要抓紧时机，及早动手，充分准备，保证夏收夏种工作胜利完成。
    关于麦收夏种准备，方案指出：要在继续加强小麦后期田间管理，力争穗大、籽多、粒饱的同时，坚决贯彻就地取材、就地生产，挖掘潜力，自力更生的工具改革方针，迅速掀起以改制夏收工具为中心的工具改革运动，大力增修农具。要认真加强牲畜饲养管理，切实防治牲畜疫病，力争在麦收开镰前，把所有瘦弱的牲畜喂肥、喂壮。要求在开镰前，要为夏播土地每亩准备底肥五千至七千斤，并要抓紧时机，力争在“小满”以前把夏播作物的底肥全部运到地头、地边；此外，还要加紧渠道和提水工具的整修工作，充分发挥现有水利工程在夏收夏种中的排灌效益。
    为保证在夏收中，确实作到不损耗、不霉烂，细收细打，颗粒还仓，方案特别强调要认真总结推广过去当地老农快速打场和战胜风雨等自然灾害抢收抢打的经验，在麦收中，要随时掌握麦熟情况，熟一方收一方，熟一块收一块，做到前割后拾，收净拾净；要就地造场，随收随打随入仓，对马上打不了的，要及时晒干垛好，防止风雨袭击发生霉烂损失。
    关于夏种，方案强调指出：各地都要保证按照国家计划及时完成各种作物的播种任务，力争种足种好。在紧张进行麦收的同时，各地都要合理组织劳动力，保证做到随收随种，并且在保证种早的前提下，认真提高播种质量。对于棉花、油料、烤烟等经济作物没有完成春播计划的地方，要尽力利用细菜茬、豌豆茬、大麦茬等早茬土地补足。方案强调要求各级党政领导都必须以夏收夏种为压倒一切的中心任务，书记挂帅，认真加强领导，充分发动群众，迅速掀起夏收夏种高潮。　（阚枫）
