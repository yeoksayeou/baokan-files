    Reading at Night
    The nights are short in the third month in Jiangnan,
    Who is willing to go to bed early?
    Hanging up the hoe, putting down the sickle,
    Whispers fill the small lanes.
    Walking over stone bridges, passing through willow smoke,
    Where the peach branches move, the lamplight flickers,
    The people's school opens its doors wide,
    Welcoming the commune members.
    The river tide roars outside the village,
    The sound of reading is loud at the village entrance,
    Hearts dive into the books,
    Like plows deeply turning the soil.
    To finish reading the new lesson,
    Who complains that the third month nights are too short?
    Not noticing that the peach blossoms are blooming in front of the door,
    The bright moon quietly shifts to the west.
    Wheat Ripening

    The peach fuzz on the branches shed their flower caps,
    The lotus leaves on the water are as large as copper coins,
    The season of wheat ripening has arrived,
    Songs and laughter fill the fields.
    The girls carry sprayers on their backs,
    The young men carry water buckets,
    Red clothes, purple skirts, blue cloth shirts,
    Float amidst the waves of wheat.
    Chasing fertilizer into the roots,
    Spraying medicine powder on the leaves,
    Sweatdrops falling among dewdrops,
    The red sun has just risen halfway.
    The motherland is fertile and the climate is warm,
    The seedlings grow so happily,
    Looking back at the field where sweat was shed,
    Jade-like ears are already full.

    江南曲
　　严阵
    夜读
    江南三月夜短，
    谁肯舍得早眠？
    挂起锄，放下镰，
    小巷里细语呢喃。
    走过石桥，穿过柳烟，
    桃枝动处灯光闪，
    民校敞开了大门，
    迎接公社的社员。
    村外江潮在响，
    村头读书声喧，
    一颗颗心儿钻进了书卷，
    像犁儿把泥土深翻。
    为了读完新的一课，
    谁不嫌三月夜短？
    不觉得门前桃花开了一树，
    明月也悄悄西偏。
    麦秀歌枝头的毛桃脱去了花蒂，
    水上的荷叶大似铜钱，
    麦秀季节来到了，
    歌声笑语满田。
    姑娘们背着喷雾器，
    小伙们挑着水担，
    红衣紫裙青布衫，
    浮动在麦浪中间。
    把肥料追进根须，
    把药粉撒上叶尖，
    汗珠儿滴在露珠儿间，
    红日刚升起一半。
    祖国土肥气候暖，
    禾苗儿长的真欢，
    回头再看洒汗的田里，
    碧玉般的穗子已经抽满。
