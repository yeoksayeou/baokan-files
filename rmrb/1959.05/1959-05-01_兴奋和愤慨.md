Excitement and Indignation
Statement by Engineer Sun Weizhong, a member of the CPPCC, who is of worker origin

Chairman, fellow members:

After listening to the reports of the leading comrades, I fully support them and have been greatly encouraged. These reports have given me a deeper understanding of the great achievements made in all aspects of the motherland's construction and the grand plans for a greater leap forward in 1959. I feel extremely excited and indescribably happy. Now I would like to talk to you about the development of our factory.

Dagu Chemical Plant has grown from a small alkali plant producing over 100 kilograms per day before liberation to a large plant producing nearly 80 tons per day. The products have increased from two to more than thirty.

In the past few years, our factory – Tianjin Dagu Chemical Plant – has been developing rapidly, just like other factories across the country. Before liberation, our factory was only a small alkali plant producing over 100 kilograms per day, with only two products. But now? It has developed to a point where the daily output of caustic soda is nearly 80 tons, and the types of products have increased from the past two to more than thirty. In addition to the main production of caustic soda and the pesticide 666, there are some new products, such as polyvinyl chloride, butadiene rubber, glacial acetic acid, bromine, metallic sodium, plant growth hormones, 2,4-D sodium salt, etc. In the comprehensive utilization of the non-toxic components of 666, many products such as high-gamma 666 pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, sodium pentachlorophenate, and hydrochloric acid have been produced. The output of products has increased rapidly, and the output value in 1958 more than doubled that of 1957, strongly supporting industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production. Furthermore, in terms of cost reduction, several products such as metallic sodium and 2,4-D sodium salt have reached the first place in the country.

The achievement of these results has been through many difficulties. However, under the leadership of the Party, the factory's employees did not succumb to difficulties, but instead mustered their energy to find ways to complete the tasks assigned to us by higher authorities. For example, there was a shortage of DC equipment, specifically "mercury rectifiers." Chemical plants were originally not capable of manufacturing such advanced electromechanical equipment, but all the employees displayed the spirit of daring to think and daring to act. With the help of higher authorities and the cooperation of brother factories, a "large mercury rectifier" was manufactured by the end of 1958. After the caustic soda production task increased, by tapping the potential of existing equipment and increasing the current density, the difficulty of insufficient electrolytic cell equipment was overcome. Then, the difficulty encountered was the caustic soda solution evaporation equipment, with insufficient evaporators. There was no steel available to make new ones, and time was tight. After the employees' research, the result was to use old equipment that had been discarded for many years, and it only took fifteen days to install a set of evaporators (if newly installed, it would take half a year). In this way, without adding new equipment in 1958, the caustic soda production increased by more than 30% compared with 1957, which greatly improved the production of other products in the factory as well.

In terms of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, we also used old factory buildings and old equipment to build new product workshops. The machine repair department only used fifty days to build a large metallic sodium workshop and put it into production, supplying the urgent needs of relevant departments.

In November 1958, Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected the chemical factory in Tanggu, which greatly encouraged the employees. All the employees expressed their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Zhu De's concern with practical actions. Therefore, in a short period of time, many key production problems were solved. At the same time, products such as "calcium carbide" and coke were also produced using indigenous methods.

While production has developed rapidly, the material and cultural life of employees has also greatly improved. Many workers were illiterate in the past. In 1958, illiteracy was completely eliminated in all workshops of the factory, and the factory's workers' spare-time Red and Expert School and the workshops' Red and Expert Schools were established. I also did not attend school in the past, and started working in the factory at a young age. After liberation, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I gradually attended the workers' spare-time Red and Expert School from being an illiterate. With the help of the Party and comrades in the trade union, etc., after more than a year, I have compiled my decades of chemical operation experience into more than 100,000 words of materials. Currently, I am compiling the second volume. The Party's concern for us is not limited to this. Many engineers and technicians of worker origin have also been promoted from among the veteran workers. I am one of them, an engineer of worker origin. What great strength and glory the Party has given us workers!

Before liberation, it was unthinkable to dream that workers could attend spare-time Red and Expert Schools, or that workers themselves could compile their valuable practical experience into books; it was even more unthinkable that workers could become engineers. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have we been cultivated and improved.

I can only do a good job to repay the Party's concern. After I go back, I will, under the leadership of the Party, rely on the employees, do a good job in the Red Flag competition, vigorously carry out the technological revolution, further tap the potential of existing equipment, and better complete the production tasks.

Indian expansionists, be sober! If you do not understand the general situation and insist on interfering in our internal affairs, you will only be hitting a stone with an egg.

Finally, I want to say a few words about the rebellion in Tibet. The former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata, in order to maintain their cruel exploitation of the Tibetan people and maintain the dark serf system, have refused to fulfill the seventeen-article agreement signed on the peaceful liberation of Tibet for several years. They have frantically undermined the unity of the motherland and national unity, shamelessly colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, openly carried out armed rebellion, committed all kinds of evil deeds such as rape, arson and murder, and abducted the Dalai Lama to India. This heinous crime has aroused great anger among the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, in order to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the Tibetan people, and in accordance with the order of the State Council, quickly quelled the rebellion in Tibet, which is fully in line with the wishes of the people of the whole country, especially the Tibetan people.

What particularly surprised and angered us is that the Indian expansionists, attempting to inherit the legacy of British imperialism, openly support the Tibetan rebellion, and describe our Tibet as a "country," and the Tibetan rebellion as a "just cause." They condone thugs to hold "demonstrations" in front of our consulate in Bombay, India, and insult the portraits of our leaders. This is intolerable. Imperialists and Indian expansionists, be sober! The Chinese people love peace, advocate peaceful coexistence, and adhere to the Five Principles, but this is by no means a sign of weakness.

The Chinese people, who have already stood up, have defeated Japanese imperialism, driven away American imperialism, and also defeated the domestic reactionary Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Today's China is no longer the China that imperialism can manipulate at will. The era when imperialism manipulated China's internal affairs has long passed. If you do not understand the general situation and insist on interfering in our internal affairs, it is nothing more than hitting a stone with an egg.

If there is anything wrong with my speech, please criticize and correct me, fellow members.

    兴奋和愤慨
    工人出身的工程师孙维忠委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了各位领导同志的报告，完全拥护并且受到了很大的鼓舞。这些报告使我对于祖国建设事业在各方面取得的巨大成绩和一九五九年更大跃进的宏伟计划得到了进一步的认识。我感到异常振奋，心里有说不出的高兴。现在我仅向大家谈一谈我们工厂的发展情况。
    大沽化工厂由解放前日产一百多公斤的小碱厂发展成日产近八十吨的大厂，产品由两种增加到三十多种
    几年来，我们工厂——天津市大沽化工厂和全国其他的工厂一样，也正在突飞猛进地发展着。我们厂在解放前只是日产一百多公斤的小碱厂，产品只有两种；而现在呢？已经发展到烧碱日产量将近八十吨，产品种类由过去的两种达到了三十多种，除主要生产烧碱、农药六六六外，还有一些新产品，如聚氯乙烯、丁钠橡胶、冰醋酸、溴素、金属钠、植物刺激素、二四D钠盐等等。在六六六无毒体综合利用方面，产出了高丙体农药六六六、六氯苯、五氯酚钠以及盐酸等很多产品。在产品产量上迅速增加，产值一九五八年比一九五七年增加了一倍以上，有力的支援了工农业生产特别是农业生产。并且在降低成本方面，金属钠及二四D钠盐等几种产品已经达到全国第一。
    这些成绩的取得是经过了很多困难的。但是厂里的职工在党的领导下，没有向困难低头，而是鼓足干劲想方设法完成了上级交给我们的任务。例如直流电设备“水银整流器”不足，化工厂本来不能制造这种尖端机电设备，但是全体职工发挥了敢想、敢干的精神，在上级帮助和兄弟厂协作之下，在一九五八年底就制造成了一台“大型水银整流器”。在烧碱任务增加以后，经过挖掘现有设备的潜力，提高电流密度，克服了电解槽设备不足的困难。接着又遇到的困难是蒸碱液设备，蒸发罐不足，做新的没有钢材，时间又紧，经过职工的钻研，结果用多年的废旧设备，只用了十五天就装起来一套蒸发罐（如果新安装需要半年的时间）。这样，在一九五八年内没有增加新设备，烧碱产量比一九五七年增加百分之三十以上，使全厂其他产品也都有很大提高。
    在勤俭办企业方面我们还利用了旧厂房及旧设备盖了新产品车间，机修部门只用了五十天就建成了大型金属钠车间并投入了生产，供应了有关部门的迫切需要。
    在一九五八年十一月朱副主席到塘沽视察了化学工厂，对职工的鼓舞很大，全体职工都表示要用实际行动回答朱副主席的关怀。因此，在短短的时间内，解决了不少生产上的关键问题。同时，还用土法生产了“电石”和焦炭等产品。
  在生产飞跃发展的同时，职工的物质文化生活也有很大的提高。许多工人过去都不识字，在一九五八年全厂各车间完全扫除了文盲，并且成立了厂的职工业余红专学校和车间的红专学校。我过去也未上过学，从小就入厂做工，解放后在党的培养教育下，由一个文盲逐步地上了职工业余红专学校；在党和工会等同志的帮助下，经过一年多的时间，把自己十几年的化工操作经验已经整理成了十几万字的资料。目前又在整理第二部。党对我们的关怀不只这一点，还从老工人中提拔了不少工人出身的工程师和技术人员。我就是其中的一个工人出身的工程师，党给我们工人多么大的力量和光荣啊。
    解放前，做梦也想不到工人能上业余红专学校，工人自己能把宝贵的实际操作经验整理成书；更想不到工人能够当工程师。只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下我们才得到了培养和提高。
    我只有做好工作来回答党的关怀。我回去以后，一定在党的领导下，依靠职工，搞好红旗竞赛，大力开展技术革命，进一步挖掘现有设备的潜力，更好地完成生产任务。
    印度扩张主义者清醒点！如果不识大体，硬要干涉我国内政，只能是以卵击石
    最后，我要说一说西藏发生的叛乱事件。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，为了维护他们对藏族人民的残酷压榨，保持黑暗的农奴制度，他们几年来拒不履行和平解放西藏所签定的十七条协议，丧心病狂地破坏祖国的统一和民族团结，无耻地勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，公开进行武装叛乱，到处奸淫烧杀，无恶不作，并且将达赖喇嘛劫往印度。这种滔天罪行，引起了藏族人民和全国人民的极大愤怒。我人民解放军驻西藏部队，为了保障藏族人民生命财产的安全，根据国务院的命令，迅速地平息了西藏的叛乱，这是完全符合全国人民、特别是西藏人民意愿的。
    特别使我们惊异愤慨的是，印度的扩张主义分子，妄图继承英帝国主义的遗产，公开支持西藏叛乱，并且把我国西藏说成是个“国家”，把西藏叛乱说成是“正义事业”，纵容暴徒到我国驻印度孟买领事馆前举行“示威”，并污辱我领袖像片，是可忍孰不可忍。帝国主义和印度扩张主义者清醒一点吧！中国人民是爱好和平，主张和平共处，坚持五项原则的，但这决不是软弱的表现。
    已经站起来的中国人民，曾经打败了日本帝国主义，赶走了美国帝国主义，也打垮了本国的反动派蒋介石匪帮，现在的中国早已不是帝国主义随意摆布的中国了。帝国主义摆布中国内政的时代早已过去了。如果不识大体硬要干涉我国内政，那不过是以卵击石罢了。
    我的发言有不对的地方，请各位委员批评指正。
