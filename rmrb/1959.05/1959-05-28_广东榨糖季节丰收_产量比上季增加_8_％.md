Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 27th. Guangdong Province's 1958-1959 sugar pressing season has basically concluded. The province produced over 450,000 tons of sugar this season, an 8% increase compared to the 1957-1958 season, with machine-made sugar increasing by 40%.

This season, Guangdong Province's sugarcane output increased by approximately 1.2 million tons compared to the previous season. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and leading groups in key sugar-producing areas established sugar production leading groups, which gradually resolved issues such as coal, diesel, transportation, and sugarcane cutting labor for the sugar industry. Many people's communes also found ways to allocate significant manpower to organize professional teams, cutting and transporting sugarcane to the sugar factories day and night. The transportation departments made every effort to tap transportation potential and improve efficiency, achieving higher loading and faster transport. In areas with less labor and poorer transportation conditions, such as Hainan and Zhanjiang, the local People's Liberation Army also organized personnel and vehicles to support the sugar factories in cutting and transporting raw materials and fuel.

The sugar factory workers enthusiastically responded to the provincial committee's call for "fast pressing, more pressing, and more sugar production," launching a "three highs" movement—high output, high quality, and high labor efficiency—which significantly increased daily pressing volume. Old sugar factories in Shunde, Dongguan, Jieyang, Mianhu, and Chengyue strengthened the Party's leadership within the enterprises, implemented the "two participations and three combinations" system, and mobilized workers to engage in technological innovation, increasing the daily pressing volume by 15% to 50% over the historical peak. Newly built or recently built sugar factories in Zhongshan, Nanhai, and Jiangmen exceeded their original designed daily pressing capacity. Sugar factories in Zhongshan, Jieyang, Shunde, and Mianhu all overfulfilled their production tasks for this season, with Mianhu Sugar Factory's output increasing by over 51% compared to the previous season, and Jieyang Sugar Factory's output increasing by over 42% compared to the previous season.

    广东榨糖季节丰收
    产量比上季增加8％
    新华社广州27日电  广东省1958到1959年的榨糖季节已基本结束。全省在这一榨季共产糖四十五万多吨，比1957年到1958年榨季增长8％，其中机制糖增长40％。
    这一榨季、广东省甘蔗产量比上一榨季大约增加一百二十万吨。中共广东省委、广东省人委和各重点产糖地区都成立了食糖生产领导小组，使制糖工业的燃煤、柴油、运输工具及斩蔗劳动力等问题都逐步得到解决。许多人民公社还想办法抽出大量人力组织专业队伍，日日夜夜为糖厂斩蔗运蔗。交通运输部门千方百计挖运输潜力，提高运输效率，做到多装快运。在海南、湛江等劳动力少、运输条件较差的地区，驻在当地的解放军也组织了人员和汽车支援糖厂斩蔗和运送原料燃料。
    各糖厂职工热烈响应省委提出的“快榨、多榨、多产糖”的号召，开展了产量高、质量高和劳动效率高的“三高”运动，使日榨量显著增加，顺德、东莞、揭阳、棉湖、城月等老糖厂都加强了企业中党的领导，贯彻了两参三结合制度，并且发动职工大闹技术革新，使日榨量比历史最高纪录还提高15％至50％。中山、南海、江门等新建或新建不久的糖厂都超过了原设计的日榨能力。中山、揭阳、顺德、棉湖等糖厂，都超额完成了这个榨季的生产任务，其中棉湖糖厂产量比上一榨季增长了51％以上，揭阳糖厂的产量比上一榨季增长42％以上。
