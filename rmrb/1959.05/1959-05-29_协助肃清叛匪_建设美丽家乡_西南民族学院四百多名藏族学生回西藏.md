Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 28th - Recently, over 400 Tibetan graduates from the Southwest Nationalities Institute in Chengdu set off to return to Tibet to participate in construction.

This group of Tibetan students came to study at the Southwest Nationalities Institute from Tibet in 1955, most of whom were from serf and impoverished families, while some were herders and handicraft workers. In the past, they suffered the cruel oppression and enslavement of Tibetan serf owners. Many had their families destroyed and perished. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, many of them participated in studies or work. In order to cultivate Tibetan cadres, the Central People's Government accepted their requests and sent them to the mainland to study.

Over the past few years, they have studied Tibetan, Chinese, mathematics, and ethnic policies, and have received socialist and communist ideological education. After the Tibetan rebellion, they expressed immense hatred for the crimes of the Tibetan traitorous clique in betraying the motherland and undermining national unity. They requested to return home to assist the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the bandits and building a new Tibet.

    协助肃清叛匪　建设美丽家乡
    西南民族学院四百多名藏族学生回西藏
    新华社成都28日电　成都西南民族学院最近有四百多名藏族毕业生，启程回西藏参加建设。
    这批藏族学生是1955年先后从西藏来西南民族学院学习的，其中绝大部分是农奴和贫苦家庭出身的子弟，有的是牧民和手工业者。他们过去受尽西藏农奴主的残酷压迫和奴役，许多人被害得家破人亡。西藏和平解放后，他们中间不少人参加了学习或工作。中央人民政府为了培养藏族干部，接受了他们的请求，把他们送来内地学习。
    几年来，他们分别学习了藏文、汉文和数学、民族政策，受到了社会主义和共产主义思想教育。西藏叛乱事件发生后，他们对西藏叛国集团背叛祖国、破坏民族团结的罪行表示无比愤恨，纷纷要求回乡协助人民解放军彻底肃清叛匪和建设新西藏。
