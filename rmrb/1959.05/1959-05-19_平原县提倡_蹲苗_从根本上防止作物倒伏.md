Pingyuan County Advocates "Nurturing Strong Seedlings"
From the Root Up to Prevent Crop Lodging
Jinan, 18th - The Pingyuan County Party Committee in Shandong Province is vigorously advocating the "nurturing strong seedlings method" to strengthen field management during the early stages of crop growth. "Nurturing seedlings" means controlling the excessive growth of young plants, encouraging deep roots, lush foliage, robust development, and strong wind resistance. This is an experience farmers have summarized from years of production practice to fundamentally prevent the lodging of tall-stalked crops later in the season.

According to investigations in the Deling and Wanggaopu Communes of Pingyuan County, corn and millet that lodged last year generally yielded about one-third less, with some severely affected yielding more than half less. While there are many reasons for lodging, the main ones are the lack of "nurturing seedlings" during the seedling stage and the blind application of fertilizer and irrigation, which leads to excessive stem growth, underdeveloped roots, and a top-heavy structure, making them vulnerable to wind and rain. Therefore, the fundamental way to prevent lodging is to strengthen management during the seedling stage.

From the beginning of sowing this spring, the Pingyuan County Party Committee emphasized the importance of the "nurturing seedlings" experience. Taking corn as an example, the seedling stage is roughly forty days. During this period, four methods should be used to "nurture seedlings": ① Apply sufficient base fertilizer and avoid topdressing as much as possible during the seedling stage. If the base fertilizer is insufficient, immediately apply a mixed nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer after thinning the seedlings, mainly to promote seedling growth and root development. ② Avoid watering as much as possible during the seedling stage. It is best to apply ample base water before sowing to meet the needs of the seedling stage. If drought occurs during the seedling stage and the soil moisture content is lower than about 15%, small furrows can be opened for irrigation. If there is continuous rain and excessive water, seize the opportunity to cultivate and loosen the soil, open ditches for drainage, or apply dry topsoil or kang soil to absorb moisture and prevent the seedlings from being waterlogged. This control of water and fertilizer will deepen the roots and thicken the base of the stems. When the corn enters the jointing stage, large amounts of water and fertilizer must be applied immediately to rapidly grow the stalks. Failure to accurately grasp this link may lead to the danger of so-called "old seedlings" (seedlings that do not grow and become old). ③ Thin and set seedlings early (thinning and setting seedlings can be done when they have two or three leaves) so that the seedlings can get rid of crowding as soon as possible, grow independently, and facilitate thickening and rooting. ④ Master the weeding techniques. When hoeing for the first time after setting the seedlings, hoe shallowly and far away to prevent burying the root nodes and hindering the development of air roots, resulting in a weak base; the second hoeing should be deep and close to loosen the soil, decompose fertilizer, and increase soil temperature. When the seedlings are one foot tall, hoe three to five times in a row. In addition, when planting, orient along the wind direction, with wide rows and dense plants, or intercrop or interplant tall and short stalk crops to facilitate ventilation and light. Hilling and earthing up should be done as early as possible to prevent stalk borer damage, etc. The experience of "nurturing seedlings" in corn to prevent lodging also applies to millet, cotton, and other crops.

Now, the Pingyuan County Party Committee is leading the masses to carry out a large-scale debate to widely and deeply absorb the effective spring seedling management experiences of the masses. The County Party Committee believes that although these experiences are ordinary, most of those responsible for managing spring seedlings now are young people and women who are not yet very familiar with this experience. Therefore, the county generally adopts a method combining grassroots cadres, young technicians, farmers, and agricultural scientific workers to summarize experience, train technical teams, and carry out a mass technical learning movement.

### 平原县提倡“蹲苗”  从根本上防止作物倒伏

    平原县提倡“蹲苗”
    从根本上防止作物倒伏
    本报济南18日电　山东平原县委大力提倡“蹲苗法”加强禾苗幼期田间管理。“蹲苗”，就是控制幼苗狂长，使它的秸棵根深叶茂、发育粗壮、抗风力强。这是农民多少年来从生产实践中总结出来的，从根本上防止高秆作物后期倒伏的经验。
    据平原县德陵、王杲铺等公社调查，去年凡是倒伏的玉米、谷子，一般少收三分之一左右，个别严重少收二分之一以上。倒伏的原因固然很多，但主要的是苗期没有“蹲苗”，以及盲目施肥浇水，使秸秆徒长，根部未发育好，头重脚轻，经不起风雨袭击。因此，防止倒伏的根本方法是加强苗期管理。
    平原县委今春一开始播种，就强调要重视“蹲苗”这项经验。以玉米来说，幼苗期大致是四十天。在这个期间内要采取四种方法“蹲苗”：①施足底肥，苗期尽量不追肥。如果底肥不足，则在定苗以后马上追氮磷钾混合肥料，主要起催苗发根的作用。②苗期尽量不浇水。最好是播种前放大底水，满足苗期需要。如苗期遇旱，土地含水分低于大约15％，可以开沟浇小水。要是阴雨连绵，雨水过大，则要抓紧中耕松土，开沟排水，或追施落房土、炕土，吸取水分，不使幼苗被水渍浸。这样从水、肥上控制，根就会加深，茎基部发粗。当玉米进入拔节期，就必须马上施以大水大肥，一气把秸秆攻成。如果掌握不准这一环节，可能有所谓“老苗”（苗长不大就变老）的危险。③早间苗、早定苗（有两三片叶子的时候就可以间苗定苗），使幼苗早日摆脱拥挤状态，独立生长，便于发粗生根。④掌握锄苗技术。定苗以后锄第一遍的时候，要浅锄远锄，以防埋住根节，不发气根，基部细弱；第二遍要深锄、近锄，以便疏松土质，分解肥料，增加地温。在苗一尺高的时候，要连锄三、五遍。此外，在种植的时候要顺风向，宽行密株，或高、矮秆作物间作、套种，以利通风透光。要及早培土封垅，防治钻心虫害，等等。玉米“蹲苗”防倒伏的经验，大体上也适用于谷子、棉花等作物。
    现在平原县委正在领导群众开展大辩论，广泛地深入地吸取群众中行之有效的春苗管理经验。县委认为：这些经验虽然是平凡的经验，但是现在负责管理春苗的多是一些青年和妇女，他们还不十分熟悉这项经验。因此，这个县普遍采取基层干部、青年技术员、农民和农业科学工作人员四结合的办法，总结经验，训练技术队伍，开展了群众性的技术学习运动。（附图片）
