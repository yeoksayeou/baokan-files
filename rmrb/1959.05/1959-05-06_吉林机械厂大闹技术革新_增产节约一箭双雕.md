    Jilin Machinery Plant Carries out Technical Innovation
    Achieving Both Increased Production and Savings
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Jilin, May 5th) The Jilin Provincial Machinery Plant, through a mass technical innovation campaign, has achieved the goal of both increasing production and saving resources. In the first quarter of this year, the plant's production efficiency increased by nearly 100% compared to the average level of last year, product costs decreased by 9%, and raw materials savings were around 10%.
    This year, the plant is responsible for manufacturing and processing a total amount of smelting, rolling steel, coal washing, and irrigation equipment that is 1.2 times greater than last year. Originally, it was planned that corresponding increases in equipment, tools, and manpower would be required; as a result of carrying out the technical innovation movement, not only can the original team complete the tasks, but more than 300 skilled workers have been transferred to support new factories.
    The goal of the plant's technical innovation movement is "three highs and two lows," that is, to achieve high output, high quality, high efficiency, and to reduce costs and raw material consumption. Focusing closely on the central task of increasing the output per unit area of machinery and equipment, workers throughout the plant have put forward more than 3,000 innovation proposals since mid-March, and more than 600 have already been implemented. The forging workshop has widely adopted die tooling, completing fifteen months' worth of work in three months. The machining workshops have generally improved fixtures, gauges, and cutting tools, and have used methods such as "one machine for multiple tasks" and "stringing sugar gourds" to string together the parts being processed, processing ten to dozens of products at a time. In terms of saving raw materials, the workers formulated a target of reducing raw material consumption quotas by 10%. On the premise of ensuring quality, the plant saved nearly 300 tons of steel in the first quarter alone. The workers in the plant's forging and riveting workshop collectively formulated the material cutting principle of "unified cutting, large sets covering small, small sets covering minutiae, and no materials taken for small jobs," so that the utilization rate of each steel plate reached more than 97%.

### 吉林机械厂大闹技术革新  增产节约一箭双雕

    吉林机械厂大闹技术革新
    增产节约一箭双雕
    本报吉林5日电　吉林省机械厂通过群众性的技术革新运动，达到既增产又节约的目的。这个厂今年第一季度生产效率比去年平均水平提高近一倍，产品成本降低9％，原材料节约10％左右。
    这个厂今年所担负的冶炼、轧钢、洗煤、排灌等设备的制造加工总量比去年增长一点二倍。原来计划需要相应增加设备、工具和人力；开展技术革新运动的结果，不仅原班人马可以完成任务，而且抽出了三百多名技术工人支援新厂。
    这个厂技术革新运动的目标是“三高两低”，即要求作到产量高、质量高、效率高，并降低成本和原材料消耗。全厂工人紧紧围绕提高机械设备单位面积产量这一中心课题，从3月中旬以来已提出三千多项革新建议，目前已实现六百余项。锻造车间广泛采用胎具化，三个月完成了十五个月的工作量。机械加工车间普遍改进卡具、量具、刃具，并用“一床多活”、“串糖葫芦”的办法，把被加工的部件连串起来，一次加工十个到几十个产品。在节约原材料方面，工人们制定了降低原材料消耗定额10％的指标，在保证质量的前提下，第一季度全厂就节约了近三百吨钢材。这个厂的锻造铆焊车间工人集体制定了“统一下料，大套小，小套了，小活不领料”的下料原则，使每块钢板的利用率达到97％以上。
