　　Najue Ma and Gelam
　　Stories of Two Tibetan Women in Diqing
　　By Our Correspondents　Zhang Tinggan　Ma Lie
　　Anyone who has been to the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan knows how painful the lives of the poor Tibetans here used to be. Eating their fill and having warm clothes were things they dared not imagine. Among them, the women suffered the most. At that time, almost half of the babies were born in the fields or mountains. They washed the babies with snow water from the creeks and used stones to cut the umbilical cords. If the mother was a slave, she had to go back to work for the slave owner the next day. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, this painful life for Tibetan women has ended. They are now more actively engaged in production and labor, creating a happier life for themselves.

　　Najue Ma's Songs
　　If a stranger were to walk into Dala Village in the Plateau People's Commune, he would hear one person singing particularly loudly among the many women's mountain songs. This is Grandma Najue Ma, a 63-year-old poor peasant. Najue Ma's singing will never stop. She turns many of the new changes happening around her into beautiful and moving mountain songs, singing from the start of work to the end, from dawn to dusk. But just a year ago, Najue Ma hadn't even sung one mountain song.
　　She was a female slave. In the past, she had parents, a husband, a younger sister, and a daughter. At most, they could only harvest half a year's worth of food. When the grain ran out, the family had to climb over layers of snow-capped mountains to beg for food in distant places. Najue Ma had wandered away to beg no less than twenty-five times. One year, there was a severe drought, and they couldn't find anything to eat even when they reached the Jinsha River. While climbing the snow mountains, her parents both died in the snowdrifts. She and her younger sister also lost their young husbands early. When the neighbors sang mournful mountain songs to express their pain, Najue Ma never sang mountain songs, and rarely even cried in front of people when her relatives died. People said: Najue Ma's tears had been dried by the snow wind, Najue Ma's pain was swallowed into her stomach.
　　After liberation, the government sent Najue Ma relief grain and relief money, and Najue Ma showed a smile for the first time. But she still didn't sing any mountain songs. Later, the government lent her seeds and food every year. Sometimes, they even gave her farm tools and clothes. Year after year... The grain her family harvested gradually increased. Her daughter grew to eighteen years old, and no one dragged her away to be a slave anymore. The sheep were well-fed and no longer taken away by the landlord to pay debts. Najue Ma gradually realized that only by following the Communist Party could she achieve complete liberation. So, she finally poured out her life's suffering to the work team and to the masses in the village. Last year, Najue Ma joined the People's Commune. She saw with her own eyes that the women sent their children to the nurseries, no longer tying them up with ropes and locking them in the house like she used to do when she went to work in the fields. The helpless old people went to the homes of happiness, no longer starving or freezing to death in the snow mountains like her parents did. In the canteen, everyone ate buttered zanba; no one had to go begging like she used to do every year. At this time, Najue Ma couldn't help but sing her first mountain song: "Chairman Mao is the pure gold sun, warming the hearts of the Tibetans, smoothing out the wrinkles on my face, I, Najue Ma, have become a real young person..." From then on, she composed more and more mountain songs, singing them endlessly. The more she sang, the more energetic she became in production. The young people got up the earliest in the morning, and she got up even earlier than the young people. She sang: "When I was young, my heart grew old. At that time, today my sheep is mine, tomorrow it will be taken away by others; today my daughter is mine, tomorrow she will be snatched away to be a slave. Now that I am old, Chairman Mao's sun has turned me into a young person again..." The commune mobilized her to enter the home of happiness, and she replied in song: "In the past, even if people were old, they had to beg for food, suffering from cold and hunger in the snow mountains, and who cared? In the past, I couldn't even think about working for myself, but now I work for myself. Basking in the sun of Chairman Mao, everywhere is like a home of happiness."

　　Liberated Gelam
　　Due to being unable to repay debts, Gelam was snatched away from a young age and sold to a slave owner's house in Xinjian Township, Nishi District, to be a slave. This middle-aged woman in her thirties experienced the most hardship, beatings, hunger, and scolding. It wasn't until April 1958 that Gelam ended this dark life of slavery. During the democratic reforms, she gained freedom, was allocated land, and built her own home. From this point on, Gelam was determined to follow the Communist Party even if the sky fell. From then on, whether it was production or meetings, she always took the lead, and soon she was elected as the vice-director of the township women's federation.
　　Last year, the plateau encountered a severe drought that hadn't been seen in decades. It was already May, but it hadn't rained yet, and the newly emerged highland barley was about to die from drought. At this time, a fierce debate broke out in the township. Some people advocated inviting monks to lead everyone in reciting scriptures. They said: how much grain is harvested each year is determined by the gods, and there is no other way except to recite scriptures and pray to the gods...; another group of people advocated finding water sources and building water conservancy projects. Gelam was the most active one in this group. She said: Labor creates the world, only digging ditches to divert water can make the highland barley grow well! There were more than two hundred people who supported reciting scriptures and those who supported building water conservancy projects, and they couldn't come to a conclusion after arguing for a long time. So, the people who advocated reciting scriptures invited monks to recite scriptures, praying day and night to the mountain gods to bring water and praying to the heavens to bring rain; the people who advocated building water conservancy projects, led by Gelam and Township Chief Chuiping, dug ditches and built water conservancy projects. The people who advocated reciting scriptures recited scriptures for three whole days, but not a drop of rain fell from the sky, and not a drop of water flowed from the mountain. Some people wavered. After a few more days, no one recited scriptures anymore; the people who built water conservancy projects became more and more energetic. They persisted in digging for more than ten days and finally found a water source inside the mountain. A column of water as thick as a bucket burst out and quickly flowed into the highland barley fields. People laughed, jumped, and reported this great news to the people of the whole township with tears in their eyes. Even the old people in their seventies and eighties said: "We have been praying to the gods all our lives, and today we know that human abilities are greater than the gods." In this way, Xinjian Township overcame the extraordinary drought for the first time in its history. In 1958, grain not only did not decrease in production, but also increased by more than 30%. Because Gelam consistently listened to the Party's words and consistently played an exemplary role in production, she was selected as a socialist activist in Yunnan.

　　娜觉玛和格拉姆
    记迪庆两个藏族妇女的故事
　　本报记者　张廷干　马烈
    凡是来过云南迪庆藏族自治州的人都知道，这里的贫苦藏胞们从前过着多么痛苦的生活。吃饱穿暖，对于他们曾经是不敢想象的事，而在他们中间，最苦的要算是妇女了。那时，差不多有半数以上的婴儿，是生在田间或山上的，他们用小溪里的雪水给婴儿洗身子，用石头断脐带。如果母亲是个奴隶，第二天还得给奴隶主去干活。解放后，在共产党的领导下，藏族妇女们这种痛苦的生活已经结束了，她们更加积极生产劳动，为自己创造更幸福的生活。
    娜觉玛的歌声
    如果一个陌生的人刚走进高原人民公社的达拉村，他会听到，在许多妇女的山歌声中，有一个人特别唱得高昂，这是一位六十三岁的贫农娜觉玛老大妈。娜觉玛的歌声是永远也不会停止的，她把周围发生的许多新变化编成美妙动听的山歌，从出工唱到收工，从天亮唱到天黑。可是，娜觉玛在一年前，却连一支山歌也没唱过。
    她是个奴女。早先，家里有父母、爱人、妹子和女儿。每年最多也收不到半年的口粮。粮食吃完了，一家人就只有爬过层层雪山，到远方去讨饭行乞。娜觉玛就曾出去流浪过二十五次之多。有一年，赶上了大旱灾，她们一直走到金沙江边，还是找不到吃的东西。在爬雪山的时候，父母都死在大雪堆中。她和她的妹妹，也都是这样早早地失去了年轻的丈夫。当邻人们用凄凉的山歌倾诉自己的痛苦的时候，娜觉玛从来也没有唱过山歌，甚至当她的亲人们死去的时候，她也很少在人面前流泪哭泣。人们都说：娜觉玛的眼泪被雪风吹干了，娜觉玛的痛苦咽到肚子里去了。
    解放了，政府给娜觉玛送来了救济粮，发来了救济款，娜觉玛第一次露出了笑脸。但是，她还是没有唱过山歌。后来，政府每年都贷给她种籽、口粮。有时候，还发给她农具和衣裳。如此一年、两年、三年……。她家打的粮食渐渐多起来了。女儿长到十八岁，再没有人拉去当奴隶了，羊儿养得肥肥的，也没有被地主牵去抵债。娜觉玛慢慢地看清了，只有跟着共产党，才能得到彻底解放。于是，她终于向工作队、向全村群众倾诉了自己一生的苦痛。去年，娜觉玛参加了人民公社，她亲眼看到，妇女们把孩子送进了托儿所，再不像她从前下地干活时，把孩子用绳子拴起来锁在屋里了；无依无靠的老年人进了幸福院，再不会像她的父母，饿死冻死在雪山上了；在食堂里，人人都吃上了酥油糌粑；再也不会像她从前年年出去要饭了。这时，娜觉玛耐不住唱出了第一支山歌：“毛主席是纯金的太阳，晒暖了藏民的心，晒去了我脸上的绉纹，我娜觉玛也成真正的青年人……。”从此，她的山歌越编越多，越来越唱不完。她越唱，生产就越有劲，青年人早晨起得最早，她比青年人还早。她唱着：“年纪青青的时候，我的心就老掉了，那时候，今天是我的羊，明天就会被别人牵走；今天是我的女儿，明天就会被别人抢去当奴隶。如今我老了，毛主席的太阳，又使我变成了青年人……。”公社里动员她进幸福院，她唱着答道：“从前人再老，也得去讨饭，在雪山挨冷受饿，又有谁来管？从前想为自己干活想不着，如今干活为自己。晒着毛主席的太阳，到处都像幸福院。”
    解放了的格拉姆
    由于还不起债，格拉姆从小就被抢去，卖给尼西区新建乡一个奴隶主家当奴隶，这位三十多岁的中年妇女，经历最多的就是干苦工、挨打、挨饿和挨骂。1958年4月，格拉姆才结束了这种黑暗的奴隶生活。在民主改革中，她得到了自由，分得了土地，建起了自己的家园。从这时起，格拉姆下定决心，就是天塌下来，也要跟着共产党走。从此，不论生产、开会，她总是走在前面，不久，被选为乡妇联的副主任。
    去年，高原上遇到了几十年没有过的大旱灾，已经是5月了，天还没有下雨，刚出土的青稞，眼看着就要旱死了。这时，乡里发生了一场激烈的争论。一部分人主张请和尚来带着大家念经。他们说：一年收多少粮食是由神决定的，除了念经求神以外，没有别的办法……；另一派人却主张找水源、修水利。格拉姆就是这派中的最积极的一个。她说：劳动创造世界，只有开沟引水才能让青稞长得好！赞成念经的和赞成修水利的各有二百多人，始终争论不出一个结果来。于是，主张念经的人们，就请了和尚念起经来，日夜祈祷山神给引水，祈祷上天给下雨；主张修水利的人们，也由格拉姆和乡长吹平带头挖沟修水利。主张念经的人们整整念了三天经，天上既没有下一滴雨，山上也没有流出一滴水来，有的人动摇了，又过几天，再也没有人念经了；修水利的人们越来越有劲，坚持挖了十几天，终于在山肚子里找到了水源，水桶那么粗的一股水柱突突地冲了出来，很快流到了青稞地里。人们笑着、跳着，含着泪珠向全乡人民报告这件大新闻。连七、八十岁的老人也都说：“求了一辈子神，今天才知道，人的本领比神还大。”就这样，新建乡有史以来第一次战胜了特大旱灾。1958年粮食不但没有减产，还增产了三成多。由于格拉姆一贯听党的话，生产上一直起着模范作用，她被选为云南的社会主义积极分子。
