The situation in Laos is developing in an extremely dangerous direction, and the three million peaceful Lao people are facing a serious threat of civil war. According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio, the Royal Lao Government announced on May 16 that it had ordered two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units on May 11 to surrender their weapons within 24 hours, or be charged with rebellion. Currently, the Lao government authorities have dispatched large numbers of troops to surround the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, plotting to disarm them; the leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, including Prince Souphanouvong, are under the strict surveillance and house arrest of the Lao military police; and a large number of Patriotic Party members have been arrested by the Lao local authorities. News has revealed that the measures taken by the Lao government against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units are only part of a conspiracy to launch a large-scale military coup; after eliminating the two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, the Lao authorities will launch a full-scale offensive against the Lao Patriotic Party, close down the "Patriotic Newspaper," declare the Patriotic Party illegal, and carry out mass arrests and killings.

The Royal Lao Government has completely torn up the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos, as well as the two agreements reached with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units in 1956 and 1957. It is, in effect, rekindling the civil war in Laos and undermining the peace and security of Indochina. In its statement at the Geneva Conference on July 21, 1954, the Royal Lao Government guaranteed: "To take effective measures to unite all Lao citizens in the common life of the nation without any discrimination, and to guarantee that they enjoy the rights and freedoms stipulated in the Kingdom's Constitution." The agreement between the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the political delegation of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units on December 24, 1956, also clearly stipulated: "To guarantee the civil rights of 'Laotians' and former resistance personnel without discrimination," and stipulated that discriminatory, retaliatory, and prohibitive actions against them "will be prosecuted in court as acts of dividing the country, undermining the unity of the motherland, violating democratic freedoms and the civil rights of the people." On November 2, 1957, the joint statement by the then Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the leader of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, Prince Souphanouvong, further stipulated that both parties agreed to establish a coalition government with representatives from the Pathet Lao Fighting Units; the Lao Patriotic Party, composed of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units and other patriotic people, would conduct legitimate political activities in the Kingdom of Laos like other political parties; the Pathet Lao Fighting Units would hand over the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua, where they were stationed in northern Laos, to the Royal Lao Government, and the Royal Lao Government guaranteed to incorporate the Pathet Lao Fighting Units into the national army. However, today the Lao authorities have completely reneged on their obligations and solemn guarantees.

The Lao authorities' brazen launch of large-scale armed persecution against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units is by no means accidental. This is the result of a long-term plan by the United States behind the scenes, and is part of the entire conspiracy of the United States to create tension in Southeast Asia and seize Indochina. At the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" Council meeting held in Wellington in early April this year, the participants, led by the schemers in Washington, blatantly listed Laos as the so-called "front line" of this aggressive organization. In order to turn Laos into its base for seizing the entire Indochina, the Wellington Conference also secretly discussed the issue of "Laos' political and economic situation and the need for greater military strength." They even drew up a "blueprint" for the invasion of Laos. Before and after this, on the one hand, the United States instigated the Sananikone government of Laos to undermine the Geneva Accords, oppose the Lao International Commission's continued implementation of its mission, abandon its agreements with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and constantly persecute and attempt to eliminate the personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units; on the other hand, it transported a large number of American military personnel and weapons and ammunition into Laos to establish military bases in Laos. The United States also incited the Royal Lao Government to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant armed forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique hiding in Laos to carry out military provocations against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Geneva Accords, which form the basis for peace and security in Indochina, have been completely abandoned in Laos. The peace of Indochina is also seriously threatened by the current situation in Laos. The People's Republic of China, as a participating country in the Geneva Conference on Indochina and a guarantor of the Geneva Accords, and as a close neighbor of Laos, cannot sit idly by and watch the Royal Lao Government tear up the Geneva Accords and endanger the peace of Indochina. The statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 18 solemnly pointed out that the Geneva Accords must be observed, and the Royal Lao Government's actions of undermining the Geneva Accords and persecuting the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units to provoke civil war in Laos must be stopped immediately, otherwise it will bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom. This expresses the unanimous demand of the entire Chinese people who love peace and resolutely uphold the Geneva Accords.

The Chinese people call on all countries and peoples who are concerned about and safeguard peace in Southeast Asia to unite and oppose and stop the Royal Lao Government's abandonment of the Geneva Accords and the creation of civil war in Laos under the instigation of the United States. We cannot but express our deep regret that the Lao International Commission, which is responsible for supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, has failed to fulfill its due responsibilities. As early as February this year, shortly after the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Sananikone, publicly declared that Laos was not bound by the Geneva Accords, the Government of the People's Republic of China pointed out that in order to monitor and stop the conspiracy of the United States and the Lao government to undermine the Geneva Accords, and to ease the serious situation in Laos, the Lao International Commission should immediately resume its activities. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as a signatory to the Geneva Accords and a close neighbor of Laos, has also made the same request several times. Poland, a member state of the Lao International Commission, has strongly advocated the immediate resumption of the International Commission's activities, and India has also expressed its agreement with the Soviet Chairman of the Geneva Conference's note to the British Chairman regarding the resumption of the Lao International Commission's activities. However, these efforts have been obstructed due to pressure exerted by the United States behind the scenes, which has delayed the Lao International Commission's action. This has, in effect, emboldened the Royal Lao Government to further undermine the Geneva Accords and openly incite civil war. In order to stop the United States and the Royal Lao Government from continuing to aggravate the current tense situation in the Indochina region, it is imperative that the Lao International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission immediately resume its activities in Laos, and the Lao International Commission must reassume the tasks and responsibilities stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

We believe that the solemn statement of the Chinese government and the just call of the Chinese people should be taken seriously by the Royal Lao Government. Now is an important moment for the Royal Lao Government to pull back from the brink.

### 老挝王国政府应当悬崖勒马

    老挝王国政府应当悬崖勒马
    老挝的局势正朝着极危险的方向发展，三百万和平的老挝人民面临着内战的严重威胁。据万象电台广播，老挝王国政府5月16日声称，它已于5月11日下令前寮国战斗部队的两个营在二十四小时内交出武器，否则即按叛乱论罪。目前，老挝政府当局已调遣大批军队包围前寮国战斗部队，阴谋解除他们的武装；前寮国战斗部队的领导人，包括苏发努冯亲王在内，已处于老挝军警的严密监视和软禁之下；大批的爱国党党员遭到老挝地方当局的逮捕。有消息透露说，老挝政府现在对前寮国战斗部队所采取的措施，还只是它企图发动一个大规模军事政变的阴谋的一部分；老挝当局在消灭前寮国战斗部队的两个营以后，将进一步对老挝爱国党发动全面进攻，封闭“爱国报”、宣布爱国党为非法，进行大捕大杀。
    老挝王国政府已彻底撕毁了1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议，也彻底撕毁了1956、1957年同寮国战斗部队两次达成的协议，实际上就是在老挝境内重新挑起内战，破坏印度支那的和平安全。老挝王国政府1954年7月21日在日内瓦会议的声明中保证：“决心采取有效措施俾使老挝全体公民不受任何歧视地团结在全国共同生活中，并保证他们享受王国宪法所规定的权利和自由。”1956年12月24日，老挝王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团的协议中，也明确规定：“保障‘寮国’和前抗战人员的公民权利，而不予歧视”，而且规定对他们的歧视、报复和禁止性质的行为“将交法庭作为分裂国家、破坏祖国的统一、侵犯民主自由和人民的公民权利而加以通缉”。1957年11月2日，老挝王国政府当时的首相富马亲王和寮国战斗部队领导人苏发努冯亲王的联合声明中，更进一步确定：双方同意成立有寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府；由寮国战斗部队和其他爱国人士所组成的老挝爱国党在老挝王国同其他政党一样，进行合法的政治活动；寮国战斗部队把它在老挝北部的驻扎地方丰沙里和桑怒两省交给老挝王国政府，老挝王国政府保证把寮国战斗部队并入国家军队。但是，今天老挝当局竟对它所承担的义务和所作的庄严保证，一笔加以勾销。
    老挝当局这次悍然对前寮国战斗部队发动大规模的武装迫害，绝非出于偶然。这是美国在幕后长期策划的结果，是美国在东南亚制造紧张局势和侵占印度支那的整个阴谋的一部分。今年4月初在惠灵顿举行的“东南亚条约组织”理事会会议上，以华盛顿的阴谋家为首的会议参加者，就曾明目张胆地把老挝列为这个侵略组织的所谓“前线”。美帝国主义者为了把老挝变成它夺取整个印度支那的基地，惠灵顿会议还曾秘密地讨论过“老挝的政治和经济以及所需要有更大的军事力量”的问题。他们甚至拟订了侵略老挝的“蓝图”。在此前后，美国一方面唆使老挝的萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议，反对老挝国际委员会继续执行任务，废弃它同寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议，不断地迫害和企图消灭前寮国战斗部队人员；一方面将美国军事人员和武器弹药大批运进老挝，在老挝建立军事基地。美国还嗾使老挝王国政府同隐藏在老挝境内的蒋介石残余武装和吴庭艳集团相勾结，向中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国进行军事挑衅。
    作为印度支那和平和安全的基础的日内瓦协议，在老挝已经遭到彻底的毁弃。印度支那的和平也由于老挝当前的局势受到严重的威胁。中华人民共和国，作为有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的保证国，作为老挝的紧邻，不能坐视老挝王国政府撕毁日内瓦协议、危害印度支那和平的严重行为。我国外交部在5月18日发表的声明中严正指出，日内瓦协议必须得到遵守，老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议和迫害前寮国战斗部队以挑起老挝内战的行为必须立即停止，否则它就要承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。这表达了爱好和平和坚决维护日内瓦协议的全中国人民的一致要求。
    中国人民呼吁一切关心和维护东南亚和平的国家和人民，共同起来反对和制止老挝王国政府在美国策动下毁弃日内瓦协议和在老挝制造内战。我们对于监督和监察日内瓦协议在老挝实施的老挝国际委员会未能履行其应尽的职责，不能不表示深深的遗憾。早在今年2月，老挝王国政府首相萨纳尼空公开声称老挝不受日内瓦协议约束以后不久，中华人民共和国政府就曾指出，为了监察和制止美国和老挝政府破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动，为了和缓老挝的严重局势，老挝国际委员会应该立即恢复活动。作为日内瓦协议的签订国和老挝紧邻的越南民主共和国也曾几次发出同样的要求。老挝国际委员会的成员国波兰曾极力主张立即恢复国际委员会活动，印度也曾表示赞同日内瓦会议苏联主席照会英国主席的关于恢复老挝国际委员会活动的意见。但是，这些努力都由于美国在幕后施加压力而遭到了阻挠，使得老挝国际委员会迟迟没有行动。这就实际上怂恿了老挝王国政府敢于进一步破坏日内瓦协议，公然挑动内战。为了制止美国和老挝王国政府继续加剧目前印度支那地区的紧张局势，老挝国际监察和监督委员会立即恢复在老挝的活动已刻不容缓，老挝国际委员会必须重新担负起日内瓦协议所规定的任务和职责。
    我们认为，中国政府的严正声明和中国人民的正义呼声，应当得到老挝王国政府的重视。现在是老挝王国政府悬崖勒马的重要关头了。
