Comrade Chairman and Representatives of the Guizhou Province Industrial and Agricultural Spare-Time Education:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Now, I will discuss the progress of our Guizhou's literacy campaign and ask for your corrections.

Culture in Backward Mountain Areas: A Surge in Learning

Pre-liberation Guizhou was a poor, blank, and culturally backward mountainous region inhabited by multiple ethnic groups. Under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the broad masses of working people were deprived of the right to education, unable to learn, resulting in illiteracy among nearly 90% of young and middle-aged people in the province. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, from 1950 to 1957, we eliminated illiteracy among approximately 700,000 young and middle-aged people in the province and promptly organized them to enter spare-time schools to continue their studies. In 1958, after the great victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, under the radiant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, and propelled by the all-round Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the people of our province launched another high tide in the literacy movement. In less than three months, we eliminated illiteracy among more than four million young and middle-aged people of various ethnic groups, exceeding six times the total number of people made literate from 1950 to 1957. This reduced the percentage of illiterate young and middle-aged workers and peasants from nearly 90% before liberation to about 15%. The working people, having initially grasped culture, were overjoyed, singing about culture returning home and thanking the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Chen Deyou, a farmer from Qingzhen County who became literate, sang: "The General Line is a beacon, illuminating so many blind people. In the past, culture belonged to landlords and rich peasants, but now culture has returned home." Many people also sang mountain songs like this: "The ground is our paper, firewood our pens, working hard to read and write, now we can write letters and books, a thousand thanks to Chairman Mao."

In our province, there are many illiterate people, few teachers, long distances, high mountains, scattered populations, economic hardship, and a multitude of ethnic groups. Eliminating illiteracy indeed encountered many difficulties. However, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of working people liberated their minds. In the face of the Great Leap Forward in production, they deeply felt that without improving production technology, they could not develop production and build socialism, and thus urgently demanded to learn culture. Under these circumstances, they finally overcame all difficulties and achieved a great victory in cultural learning.

The Wisdom of the Masses is Infinite: Difficulties are Easily Solved

With millions of people learning simultaneously, where did the teachers come from? The masses proposed the methods of "ten-character teachers," "hundred-character teachers," and "those who can, teach." From this emerged a surge of "ten thousand teach, the whole people learn," mutual teaching and learning, and teaching and learning from each other, where everyone was a teacher and everyone was a student. The broad masses of intellectuals also recognized that helping the working people become knowledgeable was their glorious task. They expressed their willingness to "give their hearts to the Party and their knowledge to the working people" and actively participated in this movement. Thus, the problem of literacy teachers was solved: first, all intellectuals in rural areas were comprehensively utilized; second, all levels of organizations adopted active and effective training methods to improve the quality of teachers. During the literacy movement, last year the province mobilized more than 1.5 million people to serve as spare-time literacy teachers, with more than one million teachers trained through various methods.

How were the kerosene, paper, equipment, and funds needed for the literacy campaign obtained? The masses, based on the principle of diligence and thrift in running schools, did not ask the government or the people's communes for a single cent. They solved the problem by reclaiming wasteland, collecting medicinal herbs, mining, transporting goods, engaging in sideline occupations, and developing high-yield fields. The farmers' spare-time school in Jiuba Township, Meitan County, used the funds obtained through the above methods. In addition to the expenses for kerosene, student textbooks, paper, and chalk, there was also a surplus used for recreational activities and the purchase of newspapers.

The wisdom of the working people is infinite. Do you say they are illiterate? They created flexible, diverse, practical, and feasible learning methods, such as learning while walking, learning during work breaks, learning by seeing objects, learning during meetings, learning in the dining hall, attending cultural fairs, viewing cultural walls, and using homophone teaching, homograph teaching, and mountain song teaching. Various textbooks compiled locally numbered in the tens of millions. An illiterate man in his sixties from Hantun Township, Bijie County, even composed a "clapper talk" and had someone copy it out as a literacy textbook. "A thousand difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, are not difficult if you rely on the masses." As long as you are under the leadership of the Party and launch a mass movement, many difficulties can be solved.

We deeply realize that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental key to the comprehensive development and great achievement of the literacy movement in our province. Chairman Mao instructed us long ago: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." The Party committees and governments at all levels in Guizhou recognize that the workers and peasants have two initiatives: to work hard in production and to love learning. These two initiatives are combined and promote each other, developing into a high tide of socialist construction. Whoever ignores this will be divorced from the masses and affect production. Some rural production teams, because the leaders did not arrange for learning, the masses in the team asked to "jump team." Last year, in the literacy movement in our province, cultural revolution headquarters were established at all levels from top to bottom, with the Party secretary personally taking charge. The literacy work and production work were "uniformly arranged, uniformly checked, and uniformly evaluated," and the slogan "Unify production and learning, separate the organizational leadership" was put forward. Even during the most intense period of steel smelting last year, many areas still insisted on cultural learning for the masses. In the literacy movement, Party committees at all levels also paid special attention to cultivating typical examples and deeply mobilizing ideological work, in order to continuously boost morale and set off high tides, so that the movement would continue to develop and become increasingly widespread and in-depth. For example, in July last year, the province held an on-site meeting, comparing the work of various places. The vivid facts of eliminating illiteracy in the Great Leap Forward in production refuted all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, and specifically learned the advanced experience of "rapid literacy with homophones," which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses in the cultural revolution and further promoted the development of the literacy movement. By September of last year, although illiterate people in the province had not been completely eliminated, there were not many left. Following this, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, a high tide of review, consolidation, and large-scale establishment of Red and Expert schools was launched throughout the province, making the number of Red and Expert schools in the province reach more than 90,000, with three million people enrolled.

Persist in Spare-Time Education: Promote Technological Innovation

We also deeply realize that implementing the Party's education policy is the fundamental key to running and maintaining good industrial and agricultural spare-time education. During the first Five-Year Plan period, under the leadership of the Party, various political, cultural, and technological "three-in-one" night schools were established in various parts of our province. In many places, these night schools were used as a base for promoting work and production. Last year, after the Party Central Committee clearly put forward the policy of "education serving the politics of the working class, and education combined with productive labor," it greatly promoted the development of industrial and agricultural spare-time education, enabling various spare-time schools in our province to enter a new stage of close integration with production and promotion of technological reform. For example, the sweet potato slicer researched and trial-produced by the Zhenjiang Red and Expert School in Tongren County can slice 13,000 catties of sweet potatoes per day, increasing work efficiency by 47 times. The Red and Expert School of Zunyi Transportation Company successfully trial-produced automobiles. There are such examples everywhere. The Party's education policy makes the content of mass spare-time education consistent with the Party's central tasks and production tasks, the organizational leadership consistent with production organization, and corrects the rigid form confined to the classroom in terms of learning time and form. It combines meetings and discussions with political classes, and combines productive labor with technical classes. This approach is called by the masses "books follow people, what is taught follows production, and teachers follow students." In this way, the contradiction between learning and production is resolved. In many areas, Red and Expert schools have persisted in learning even when production tasks are most urgent.

Education and Production are Closely Integrated and Promote Each Other

Judging from the literacy movement in our province over the past few years, we believe that the high tide of production is the most favorable time to develop industrial and agricultural education. Education and production have contradictions in terms of time, but in essence, they are closely integrated and promote each other. The higher the tide of production, the more urgently the masses demand to learn culture, and the more political and technical learning is needed. Of course, this does not mean that industrial and agricultural education should not give way to production. Education serves production, and should give way when production is tight, but it does not mean that learning should be stopped. On the issue of time, the two are unified and properly arranged. If the arrangements are appropriate, the facts prove that it is entirely possible to persist in learning during the high tide of production. From our province's work in developing industrial and agricultural education, we believe that it should be: insist on learning during the busy season of production, and engage in movements during the less busy season of production. In this way, we can give full play to the two initiatives of the workers and peasants in production and learning, closely integrate production and learning, promote each other, and carry it out in an in-depth and sustained manner.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, our province made tremendous achievements in literacy work. However, in our work, there are still some shortcomings and problems. During the steel smelting campaign last year, some Red and Expert schools stopped learning and have not yet recovered, resulting in about 30% of those who became literate becoming illiterate again because they failed to continue their studies. At the same time, individual areas also had crude and boastful phenomena in their literacy work last year. At present, the broad rural people's communes in our province have been rectified, and an even greater leap forward in production has emerged, which has brought extremely favorable conditions for the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural education. Now we are fully developing industrial and agricultural education in conjunction with spring plowing production, preparing to launch a large-scale movement in June, July, and August, and strive to eliminate all young and middle-aged illiterates in our province this year, and organize them to enter spare-time senior primary schools, in order to lay a solid foundation for popularizing adult senior primary education next year and popularizing adult secondary education during the second Five-Year Plan period.

    文化回了家　不当睁眼瞎
    田君亮代表谈贵州省工农业余教育主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，和彭真副委员长所作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告。现在我谈一谈我们贵州扫除文盲工作进行的情况，请各位指正。
    文化落后山区　掀起学习高潮
    解放前的贵州，是一个又穷又白、文化落后的多民族的山区。在国民党反动派的长期统治下，广大的劳动人民被剥夺了受教育的权利，想学习文化而不可能，以致全省文盲在青壮年中几乎占了百分之九十。解放以后，我们在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，从一九五○年到一九五七年，便在全省青壮年中扫除了文盲七十万人左右，并且及时地组织他们进入了业余学校，去继续学习。一九五八年，在全民整风运动和反右派斗争取得了伟大的胜利以后，在党的建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产全面大跃进的推动下，我省人民又掀起了一个扫盲运动的高潮，不到三个月就扫除了各族青壮年文盲四百多万人，超过一九五○年到一九五七年扫盲总数的六倍，使工农群众中的青壮年文盲，由解放前的将近百分之九十，下降为百分之十五左右。工农劳动人民初步掌握了文化，莫不欢欣鼓舞，歌唱文化回家，感谢共产党和毛主席。清镇县脱盲农民陈德友唱道：“总路线，是灯塔，照亮好多睁眼瞎，从前文化归地富，如今文化回了家。”很多人还唱着这样的山歌：“地当纸来柴当笔，读书识字下苦力，如今会写书和信，千谢万谢毛主席。”
    在我们省里，文盲多，师资少，路远山高，人烟分散，再加上经济贫困，又是多民族的地区，要扫除文盲，确实碰到了很多的困难。但是，在党的领导下，广大劳动人民解放了思想；他们在生产大跃进的面前，深深地感到再不改进生产技术，就不能发展生产和建设社会主义，因而迫切地要求学习文化。在这种情况下，他们终于克服了一切困难，在文化学习上取得了巨大的胜利。
    群众智慧无穷　困难迎刃而解
    几百万人同时学习，师资从何而来呢？群众提出了“十字先生”，“百字先生”，“能者为师”的办法。从这里便出现了一个人人是先生、人人是学生的互教互学和教学相长的“万人教、全民学”的热潮。而广大的知识分子，也认识了帮助劳动人民知识化是自己的光荣任务，他们纷纷表示要“把心交给党，把知识交给劳动人民”，并且都积极地投入了这一运动。这样，扫盲的师资问题便解决了：一是综合利用了农村的一切知识分子；一是各级组织都采取了积极有效的培训办法，提高师资。在扫盲运动中，去年全省曾动员一百五十多万人担任了业余扫盲的教师，经过各种方式培训的教师在一百万人以上。
    扫盲工作所需的灯油、纸张、设备和经费怎样办呢？群众本着勤俭办学的原则，不向政府、人民公社要一文钱，他们用开荒、采药、挖矿、搬运、搞副业、搞高额丰产田的办法解决了。湄潭县久坝乡的农民业余学校，它用以上办法所得的经费，除了灯油、学员书本、纸张及粉笔等开支外，还有剩余用于文娱活动以及购买报纸等等。
    劳动人民的智慧是无穷的。你说他们是文盲吗？他们却创造了灵活多样、切实可行的学习方法，如走路学、工间学、见物学、开会学、食堂学、赶文化场、看文化墙以及同音字教学、同形字教学和山歌教学等等。各地自编的各种课本，数以千万计。毕节县汉屯乡一个六十多岁的文盲，还编出“快板”，请人抄出作扫盲课本。“千难万难，依靠群众就不难”。只要在党的领导下，大搞群众运动，许多困难都是可以解决的。
    我们深深地体会到：党的领导是我省扫盲运动能够全面开展并取得了巨大的成就的根本关键。毛主席早就指示我们：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”贵州的各级党委和政府都认识到工农群众具有努力生产和热爱学习的两个积极性。这两个积极性互相结合，互相推动，便发展成为建设社会主义的高潮。谁要忽视这点，谁就会脱离群众，使生产受到影响。有的农村生产队，由于领导上不安排学习，队内群众就要求“跳队”。去年我省在扫盲运动中，从上到下，都层层建立了文化革命指挥部，党委书记亲自挂帅，把扫盲工作与生产工作做了“统一布置、统一检查、统一评比”，提出了“生产学习统一抓，组织领导不分家”的口号。即使是在去年大炼钢铁最紧张的时候，不少地区仍然坚持了群众的文化学习。在扫盲运动中，各级党委还特别重视了培养典型、深入发动思想的工作，用以不断地鼓干劲，掀高潮，使运动不断发展，日愈广泛而深入。如在去年七月，全省召开了原场、现场会议，把各地的工作进行了评比，拿生产大跃进中扫除文盲的生动事实驳倒了各种各样的右倾保守思想，并且具体学习了“同音字快速扫盲”的先进经验，大大地鼓舞了群众文化革命的干劲，进一步推动了扫盲运动的发展。到了去年的九月，全省文盲虽然还没有扫除净尽，但已经不多了。继此之后，在各级党委领导之下，全省各地又掀起了一个复习、巩固运动和大办红专学校的高潮，使红专学校在全省达到九万多所，有三百万人入校学习。
    坚持业余教育　推动技术革新
    我们也深深地体会到，贯彻党的教育方针是办好和坚持工农业余教育的根本关键。在第一个五年计划期间，在党的领导下，我省各地创办了一些政治、文化、技术“三合一”的夜校，不少地方把这种夜校作为推动工作、推动生产的阵地。去年党中央明确地提出了“教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针以后，大大地推动了工农业余教育的发展，使我省的各种业余学校进入了紧密结合生产、推动技术改革的新阶段。如铜仁县镇江红专学校研究试制的红苕切片机，日切红苕一万三千斤，提高了工效四十七倍；遵义运输公司的红专学校试制成功了汽车；这样的例子各地都有。党的教育方针使群众的业余教育在内容上同党的中心任务、生产任务一致起来，在组织领导上同生产组织一致起来，在学习时间和形式上纠正了那种拘于课堂的死板的形式，并且把开会讨论和政治课结合起来，把生产劳动和技术课结合起来。这样做法群众叫做“书跟人走，教的东西跟生产走，教师跟着学生走”。这样一来，学习和生产的矛盾就解决了。有不少地区的红专学校，即便是在生产任务最紧迫的时候，也都坚持了学习。
    教育生产紧密结合相互推动
    从几年来我省的扫盲运动来看，我们认为：在生产高潮中，正是开展工农教育的最有利的时机。教育与生产在时间上是有矛盾的，但在实质上又是密切结合、相互推动的。越是生产的高潮，群众越是迫切要求学习文化，越是需要政治、技术学习。当然这决不是说，工农教育不应当为生产让路。教育是为生产服务的，生产紧张时就应该让路，但也不是说应当停止学习。在时间的问题上是把两者作统一适当的安排；如果安排适当，事实证明，是完全可以在生产高潮中坚持学习的。从我省开展工农教育的工作中，我们认为应当是：生产大忙坚持学，生产小忙搞运动。这样就可以充分发挥工农群众生产与学习的两种积极性，使生产与学习紧密结合，互相推动，深入、持久地开展下去。
    在一九五八年的大跃进中，我省在扫盲工作上取得的成绩是巨大的。但是，在我们的这一工作中，也还存在着一些缺点和问题。在去年大炼钢铁时，有些红专学校停止了学习，至今尚未恢复，以致有百分之三十左右的脱盲者，由于未能继续学习，又成文盲。同时，去年个别地区在扫盲工作中，也还有粗糙和浮夸的现象。当前我省广大的农村人民公社已经得到了整顿，一个更大跃进的生产高潮已经出现，这给工农教育的继续跃进带来了极为有利的条件。现在我们正在结合春耕生产，全面地开展了工农教育工作，准备在六、七、八月份大搞运动，力争在今年内将我省的青壮年文盲全部扫清，并组织他们进入业余高小，为在明年内普及成人高小教育、在第二个五年计划期内普及成人中学教育打下坚实的基础。
