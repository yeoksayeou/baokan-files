Comrades of the Presidium and fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and support the government work report made by Premier Zhou, which is an inspiring report and one that encourages the people of the whole country to continue the Great Leap Forward. Similarly, I also fully agree with the report on the draft national economic plan for 1959 by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, the report on the final state accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959 by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Like all fraternal factories across the country, our Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has undergone a series of tremendous and profound changes on the political and ideological front in recent years, along with the rapid development of production. The year 1958 was a year of overall Great Leap Forward, and the changes in that year were even more earth-shaking and inspiring. Now, I would like to give a brief report on some of the changes and developments in our factory.

Under the leadership of the Party, through the great rectification movement and the struggle against the rightists, the communist ideology of the broad masses of workers and staff has been unprecedentedly enhanced. They have broken down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and established a communist style of daring to think and daring to act, thereby changing the face of production in our factory. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the total output value of our factory increased by 1.02 times compared with 1957. A total of 27 new products were successfully trial-manufactured throughout the year, equivalent to five times that of 1957, and 14 more than the total of the first five-year plan, five of which have reached advanced levels at home and abroad. Labor productivity increased by 74.7 percent, and the profits created for the country also increased by 12.8 times. In order to adapt to a greater leap forward, the focus of the movement was directed towards simplifying the structure of machine tools. Based on the needs of China's production development, the workers improved the structure of the machine tools, following the principles of simplification where appropriate, complexity where necessary, precision where needed, and roughness where suitable. This not only saved raw materials, but more importantly, it opened the prelude to machine tool design, daring to propose the design of new machine tools. In order to ensure the implementation of the 1959 leap forward plan, the entire factory launched a movement of arming ourselves and a product design revolution. From November of last year to the end of February of this year, the entire factory manufactured 152 sets of indigenous equipment. The characteristics of these indigenous equipment are: simple structure, material saving, high specialization, and high efficiency. The tool workshop of our factory successfully trial-produced the high-precision C868 type first-grade precision lead screw lathe, mastering the technical cutting edge of the machine tool manufacturing industry. The birth of this machine tool will create conditions for China's machine manufacturing industry to advance from the ordinary machine tool manufacturing level to the advanced precision manufacturing level. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our No. 1 workshop, like all fraternal workshops in the factory, achieved great results under the leadership of the Party. The output of lathes increased by nearly one time compared with 1957, and the output in more than three years of production increased by 1.25 times compared with the designed output. The workshop cost of unit products decreased by 147.8 percent compared with 1957, thereby realizing the workers' promise of "doubling the output and halving the cost." In the process of arming ourselves and building indigenous equipment on a large scale, under the direct leadership of the Party, all the workers in the workshop worked hard, practically, and cleverly to overcome the key equipment bottlenecks and build indigenous equipment on a large scale. In about one month, more than 20 sets of indigenous equipment appeared, and 21 sets have now been put into production. Among them, the bed head group of workers used only more than 30 hours to transform a C63 lathe into a deep hole drilling machine. The efficiency is the same as that of a foreign deep hole drilling machine, but the cost is only one-thirtieth of that of a foreign machine tool, thus solving the key and increasing efficiency by more than one time. According to the needs of the state, at the end of last year, the Party committee instructed to vigorously carry out a mass product design revolution. According to the direction of the Party committee's instructions, under the encouragement of the slogan of greeting "May Day" and offering gifts to Labor Day, a mass design upsurge was formed. Leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers closely combined and adopted the parallel continuous operation method of designing, compiling technology, making wooden molds, and preparing tools at the same time, which not only greatly shortened the design cycle (only more than 50 days to complete all design tasks), but also cultivated the ability of workers to engage in design work, so that design workers and practical work were closely combined.

The new ordinary screw lathe that we designed ourselves has the following characteristics:

1.  The performance is more extensive, increasing the lead screw turning thread and turning end face thread.
2.  The speed is high (2,500 revolutions/minute), and the power is large, which is suitable for various high-speed cutting, creating conditions for the widespread use of ceramic tools.
3.  The feed amount for turning is increased. The tailstock can be driven by the saddle. During drilling, it can automatically feed and control the drilling depth. Both forward and reverse gears and brakes use electromagnetic clutches, so the operation is light, flexible, and safe. The multi-position handle is changed to a single handle operation, which not only reduces physical labor, but also reduces auxiliary time.
4.  The materials used are all our own national material specifications and try to save materials as much as possible. Substitute materials such as plastic are used for the handle, and ductile iron is used for the spindle.

The birth of this new product marks that our machine tool workers have initially broken through the circle of imitation and are gradually moving towards a new stage of independent design and manufacturing. At present, all the workers and staff are conducting trial production with soaring enthusiasm and a hundredfold confidence, determined to successfully trial-produce it before "May Day" and offer gifts to Labor Day.

In short, the reason why our factory and our workshop have been able to achieve certain results in terms of output, economic benefits, and technological revolution is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the assistance of the Soviet Union to us, and the vigorous support of fraternal units across the country.

In order to better realize the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward plan for 1959, first of all, we must continue to oppose conservative thinking, break down superstitions, emancipate our minds, advocate daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, advocate hard work, practical work, and clever work, further boost revolutionary energy, and launch a vigorous technical revolution and high-yield, high-quality red flag competition centered on realizing this year's greater leap forward plan. The action slogan of our factory is: politics in command, red and expert, red flag competition extensively launched, daily output level exceeds 50 (units), one person is worth one and a half people. Under the guidance of the overall national and factory policy, our workshop plans to increase the daily output level of 1 A62 lathes to 35 units, which is 3.3 times higher than the original design. In order to achieve this level, in addition to continuing to consolidate the experience of 1958, we must also focus on solving the weak links of large parts to drive all machine tools and all production processes to fully pass the test. That is, one piece of equipment is worth one and a half pieces, to realize the Party committee's instruction that one person is worth one and a half people, consolidate the methods of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management, the methods of mutual combination of leading personnel, technical personnel, and the masses of workers, improve the level of enterprise management, do a good job in the mass economic accounting system, strive to improve labor productivity, deeply carry out the high-yield, high-quality red flag competition movement, improve labor organization, mobilize all positive factors, and work even more brilliantly with the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work to complete this year's magnificent leap forward plan!

The issuance of the notice by the Party Central Committee and the State Council on convening a national meeting of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the industrial and other systems in the fourth quarter of this year has further stimulated our labor enthusiasm. All workshops and all workers and staff of our factory have formulated plans to come to Beijing, expressing their determination to complete this year's leap forward plan. Now, let me represent all the workers and staff of our factory and express to the conference that we are determined to complete the national leap forward plan ahead of schedule, create greater achievements, and strive to win glory at the Beijing gathering of heroes in the fourth quarter. Finally, let us better unite, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, further boost our energy, strive to realize the conference resolutions, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!

I wish the conference a successful conclusion, all the delegates good health, and new victories in the Great Leap Forward!

　　一人顶他一人半
    王文山代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告，这是一个振奋人心的报告，也是鼓舞全国人民继续大跃进的报告。同样的，对于李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告及彭真副委员长所作的关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，我亦完全同意。
    我们沈阳第一机床厂和全国各兄弟厂一样，几年来在生产飞跃发展的同时，在政治思想战线上发生了一系列巨大而深刻的变化。一九五八年是全面大跃进的一年，这一年的变化更是惊天动地，振奋人心。现在就把我们厂的一些变化和发展情况，作一简短地汇报。
    在党的领导下，经过伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，广大职工的共产主义思想空前提高，破除了迷信，解放了思想，树立了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，从而改变了我们厂的生产面貌。一九五八年大跃进中，我们厂总产值比一九五七年增长了一点零二倍，全年共试制成功了二十七种新产品，相当一九五七年的五倍，比第一个五年计划总和还多十四种，其中有五种已经达到了国内外先进水平。劳动生产率增长了百分之七十四点七，为国家创造的利润也增长了十二点八倍。为了适应更大的跃进，运动的锋芒指向精减机床结构，职工们本着不影响性能与使用精度的原则，根据我国生产发展的需要，当简则简，当繁则繁，当精则精，当粗则粗的原则，改进了机床结构。这样，不仅节约了原材料，而更重要的是揭开了机床设计的序幕，敢于提出设计新的机床。为了确保一九五九年跃进计划的落实，全厂掀起以自己武装自己和产品设计革命运动，从去年十一月到今年二月底全厂制造出一百五十二台土设备，这些土设备的特点是：结构简单、节省材料、专用性大、效率高。我厂工具车间试制成功了高精度C868型一级精度丝杠车床，掌握了机床制造业的技术尖端，这台机床的诞生将为我国机器制造业由普通机床制造水平迈进到高级精度制造水平创造了条件。在一九五八年大跃进中我们一号车间也和全厂各兄弟车间一样，在党的领导下取得了很大成绩，车床产量比一九五七年增长将近一倍，投入生产三年多的时间比设计产量增长了一点二五倍，单位产品的车间成本比一九五七年降低了百分之十四七点八。从而实现了职工们的“产量翻一番，成本砍一半”的诺言。在武装自己大造土设备过程中，车间全体职工在党的直接领导下，为突破设备关键，以苦干、实干、巧干的精神大造土设备，在一个月左右的时间就出现了二十多台土设备，现已有二十一台投入生产，其中床头三组职工仅用三十多个小时就用C63车床改装成深孔钻床，效率和洋深孔钻一样，但造价只用洋机床的三十分之一，从而解决了关键，提高效率一倍多。根据国家需要，去年年底，党委指示大力开展群众性的产品设计革命，根据党委指示的方向，职工在迎接“五一”向劳动节献礼的口号鼓舞下，形成了群众性的设计高潮，领导干部、技术人员和工人密切结合起来采取了边设计边编工艺，边制木型，边准备工具的平行连续作业办法，不仅使设计周期大为缩短（只用五十多天全部完成了设计任务），而且培养了工人从事设计工作的能力，使设计工作者和实际工作密切的结合起来。
    我们自行设计的新产品普通螺丝车床有以下特点：
    1、使用性能更广泛，增加了光杠车削螺纹和车削端面螺纹。
    2、转数高（二千五百转／分），功率大，适应于各种高速切削，为广泛采用陶瓷刀创造条件。
    3、增大了进刀量车削，台尾可用床鞍带动，钻孔时可以自动进刀，可以控制钻孔深度，反正车与刹车都采用了电磁离合器，因而操作轻便、灵活、安全，将多位手柄改为单一手柄操作，不仅减轻体力劳动，同时也减少了辅助时间等。
    4、所用的材料都是我们国家自己的材料规格和尽量节约材料，用代用材料如手柄采用塑料，主轴用球墨铸铁等。
    这台新产品的诞生标志着我们机床工人已经初步冲破了仿造的圈子，逐渐走向独立设计制造的新阶段。目前全体职工正以冲天的干劲，百倍的信心进行试制，决心在“五一”节前试制成功，向劳动节献礼。
    总之，我们厂和我们车间所以能够在产量和经济效果上以及技术革命中取得一定的成绩，是党中央和毛主席的英明领导，苏联对我们的帮助和全国各兄弟单位大力支援分不开的。
    为了更好的实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进计划，首先我们要继续反对保守思想、破除迷信、解放思想、提倡敢想、敢说、敢干，提倡苦干实干巧干，进一步鼓足革命干劲，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的以实现今年更大跃进计划为中心的技术革命、高产优质红旗竞赛。我们厂的行动口号是：政治挂帅红又专、红旗竞赛大开展、日产水平超五十（台），一人顶他一人半。我们车间在全国和全厂一盘棋的方针指导下，1 A62车床日产水平计划提高到日产三十五台，即比原设计增长三点三倍。我们为达到这个水平，除继续巩固一九五八年的经验外，还要以解决大型零件的薄弱环节为中心的带动各个机床，各个生产工序全面过关。也就是一台设备顶他一台半，实现党委指示的一人顶他一人半，巩固干部参加劳动，工人参加管理的方法，领导人员、技术人员、工人群众互相结合的方法，提高企业管理水平，搞好群众性的经济核算制，努力提高劳动生产率，深入开展高产优质红旗竞赛运动，改善劳动组织，调动一切积极因素，更出色地用苦干实干巧干的精神为完成今年的宏伟跃进计划而奋斗！
    党中央和国务院发出关于在今年第四季度召开全国工业等系统先进集体和先进生产者代表会议通知后，更加激发了我们的劳动热情，我们厂各个车间和全体职工，都纷纷制定进京规划，表示决心以完成今年跃进计划。现在，让我代表我厂全体职工，向大会表示我们有决心提前完成国家跃进计划，创造更大的成绩，争取第四季度来北京群英会上争光荣。最后，让我们更好的团结起来，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，进一步鼓足干劲，为实现大会决议，为一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗！
    预祝大会胜利成功，全体代表身体健康，并在大跃进中取得新的胜利！
