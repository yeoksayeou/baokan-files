Collective Learning and Individual Study
Lu Ge

The great leap forward in national construction, and the demand to rapidly catch up with the world's advanced levels in science and culture, inspire the hearts of every young person. Knowledgeable young people studying in schools, after the rectification campaign, the double-anti movement, the Red and Expert debate, and the debate on educational policy, have clarified the purpose of learning, and their enthusiasm for learning is even higher, and their energy for learning is even greater. Rapidly mastering knowledge and learning skills in order to serve the socialist construction of the motherland has become the unanimous aspiration of the vast number of knowledgeable young people in schools.

A major feature of the emerging learning atmosphere in schools is the widespread adoption of collective learning forms. Many students have organized study groups on the basis of self-study, helping each other in learning and discussing together. This is the result of implementing the mass line in school teaching and fully mobilizing students' learning enthusiasm. This collective learning method does promote students' learning. It can integrate everyone's strengths, exchange everyone's learning experiences and insights, concentrate everyone's wisdom, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, inspire each other, and solve difficult problems in a timely manner, so that everyone can improve together. Everyone can supervise each other between groups or within the same group, and check each other, overcome the slack and favoritism that may occur in individual learning; it is also convenient for teachers to understand the learning situation and progress, and for teachers and students to carry out cooperation. Many school study groups are not limited to mutual assistance in learning, but also care for each other in political thought and take care of each other in life, so they can also strengthen the relationship between classmates and increase mutual understanding. The ancients often regarded "good teachers and helpful friends" as important conditions for learning progress, so the love and mutual assistance between classmates is indispensable in learning.

However, we must not conclude that we only need to emphasize collective learning in schools and do not need individual study. On the contrary, while emphasizing collective learning, we must also emphasize individual hard work. Collective learning and individual study are two aspects of learning. "Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang," one person's wisdom is never as rich as collective wisdom. However, learning also has the characteristics of individual labor, and everyone must work hard to get real gains. There is a relationship of unity of opposites between the two, and it must be handled correctly.

First of all, collective learning must be carried out on the basis of individual hard work. Only when everyone has worked hard to study, digest and consolidate the knowledge and skills learned, and turn them into their own, can they be mutually improved through collective mutual assistance. Otherwise, everyone will stay on a superficial understanding, and no one will go deeper, so it will be difficult for anyone to help anyone, and collective learning will easily become a formality. Secondly, organizing collective learning must pay attention to the differences in everyone's learning. In learning each subject, the gains and understanding obtained by each person vary from person to person. Due to the differences in everyone's foundation, hobbies, expertise, etc., although the courses studied in the same department or class in the school are the same, and everyone is required to learn each course well, the learning focus and progress requirements in everyone's self-study time cannot be the same, and the time and energy spent on each subject cannot be the same, and everyone's attainments can never be equal. If we overemphasize learning in the collective, and even let collective learning replace individual study, the result will inevitably lead to mutual accommodation, forced uniformity, and the phenomenon of leveling off in the learning of each subject, which is obviously contrary to improving the quality of learning. Therefore, just as teachers in teaching must be responsible for the collective of a class and teach each student according to their aptitude, students' learning should also accept knowledge in the collective and improve in mutual assistance, and must also carry out individual independent study on the existing basis.

Especially in universities, in order to be able to work independently and conduct scientific research independently after graduation, students' learning should be more of a creative activity, and individual independent study should become the main way for students to study on their own.

In fact, to learn any subject well, you must put in hard work yourself. Your own efforts are the main thing, and the help of others can only be secondary. Everyone remembers Marx's famous saying: "There is no smooth road to science, and only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing the rugged path can hope to reach the brilliant summit." This famous saying should become the motto of every young person engaged in learning. As the old Chinese saying goes: "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch tiger cubs?" Without serious and in-depth study, it is impossible to get true understanding. Therefore, if students studying in the same collective group do not study hard themselves, although they can learn what they should learn through the help of the collective, they can never learn it thoroughly, nor can they consolidate it, let alone achieve the point of drawing inferences from one instance. Some people have not studied hard themselves, but due to the help of the collective, they also got five points in the exam, and they said: "Listen to this, listen to that, and it's almost the same when you take the exam." Although such learning has achieved immediate results, it has not actually gained real gains.

The great revolutionary teachers Marx and Engels can serve as a model for our young students in correctly combining collective mutual assistance and individual study in learning, with their deeds of close cooperation in scientific undertakings and their own diligent research. From the memories written by Lafargue and Liebknecht in the book "Recollections of Marx and Engels", we can see how the two of them carried out joint mental labor in scientific undertakings, how they were accustomed to working together, but at the same time how they each studied the science they needed and loved with great perseverance. Even Marx's diligence in mathematics and Engels' diligence in military science have achieved high attainments. Moreover, although they worked together, they did not completely rely on each other's strengths without making their own efforts. For example, when Marx wrote newsletters for the New York Daily Tribune in his early years, he was not yet proficient in English, so Engels helped him translate, but later Marx became proficient in English himself and could write in English. Engels' Russian was very good, but in order to study some Russian agricultural materials, Marx did not completely rely on Engels, but began to learn Russian at the age of fifty, and achieved excellent results in half a year. Their spirit of close mutual assistance and hard work is always worthy of our admiration and learning.

Some comrades associate collective learning with collectivism and individual study with individualism, and therefore believe that participating in collective learning is taking the road of cooperation and taking the road of Red and Expert, while individual study is "going it alone" and taking the road of White and Expert. This understanding is not entirely correct. In the rectification movement, we criticized some people who only focused on studying their profession, did not care about politics, and were only experts but not Red, but their mistake was not that they should not be experts, should not study hard, but that they were unwilling to be Red and did not seek progress in politics. They started from individualism and一心想成名成家, which is not right, but socialist society also needs engineers, scientists, writers, artists, etc.; we oppose young people's ideas of fame and profit, but we should never oppose young people's legitimate efforts to become engineers, scientists, etc. in the future. The hard work of young students now is to prepare for future construction or scientific careers. The more people who study hard in schools, the faster and better our future construction and scientific level can develop and improve.

The motherland's economic construction is advancing at a high speed, and the cause of science and culture is flourishing. We need a large number of engineers, scientists, writers, artists, and various construction cadres who are both Red and Expert. This requires young students to study hard in schools, study hard, and break through the scientific and technological fortresses. In the learning process, it is absolutely necessary to help each other and improve together, but individual independent study should also not be neglected at all. Any idea or practice that emphasizes one aspect and neglects the other is detrimental to improving the level of learning. Only by appropriately combining collective learning and individual study according to the specific circumstances of different courses and different grades is the correct way to improve the level of learning. This is what every young student must understand, and it is also what every comrade engaged in education should pay attention to.

    集体学习和个人钻研
    鲁歌
    国家建设事业大跃进，在科学文化上迅速赶上世界先进水平的要求，激励着每一个青年的心。在学校里学习的知识青年，经过整风、双反运动、红专辩论、教育方针辩论，明确了学习的目的性以后，学习的热情更高了，学习的劲头更大了。迅速掌握知识，学好本领，以便为祖国的社会主义建设服务，成为学校广大知识青年一致的愿望。
    在学校里新兴起来的学习风气有一个很大的特点，就是集体学习形式的普遍采用。许多同学都在自学的基础上组织了学习小组，在学习上互相帮助，共同讨论。这是在学校教学上贯彻群众路线，充分发挥学生的学习积极性的结果。这种集体学习的方式，确实对同学们的学习起了促进作用。它可以融合各人的特长，交流各人的学习经验和心得，集中大家的智慧，取长补短，相互启发，及时解决疑难问题，使大家得到共同的提高。在组与组间或同组之间大家可以相互督促，相互检查，克服个人学习时可能出现的散漫和偏废现象；也便于教师了解学习情况和学习进度，便于师生间开展合作。有许多学校的学习小组，不仅限于学习上的互助，还在政治思想上互相关心，生活上互相照顾，因此还可以密切同学之间的关系，增加相互间的了解。古人常把“良师益友”当作学习进步的重要条件，可见同学间的友爱互助是学习上不可缺少的。
    但是，我们决不能就此得出结论，认为在学校中只要强调集体学习而用不着个人钻研了。正相反，我们在强调集体学习的同时，还必须更加强调个人的刻苦钻研。集体学习和个人钻研是学习的两个方面。“三个臭皮匠，胜似诸葛亮”，一个人的智慧总不如集体智慧的丰富。但是学习又具有个体劳动的特点，每个人的学习又必须自己努力才能有真正的收获。二者之间有着对立的统一的关系，必须正确地加以处理。
    首先，集体学习必须在个人刻苦钻研的基础上进行，只有每个人都下了刻苦钻研的工夫，把学习到的知识技能加以消化、巩固，变成各人自己的东西，才能通过集体互助，得到相互提高。否则，大家都停留在浮光掠影的了解上，谁也没有深入，也就谁也难于对谁帮助，集体学习也就容易流于形式。其次，组织集体学习必须注意各人在学习上的差异性。在学习每一门学问中，各人所得到的收获和领会是因人而异的，由于各人的基础、爱好、特长等等的不同，尽管在学校相同的系科或班次中所学的课程是一样的，而且也要求每个人对每一门功课都要学好，但是各人在自学时间内的学习重点和进度要求既不可能相同，对每门学科所花的时间所费的精力也不可能一样，各人的造诣也决不可能相等。如果过分强调在集体中学习，甚至使集体学习代替了个人钻研，其结果必然造成互相迁就，勉强一律，在各科学习上彼此拉平的现象，这显然对提高学习质量是背道而驰的。因此，正如同教师在教学中既要对一个班级的集体负责又要对各个同学因材施教一样，同学们的学习也应该既在集体中接受知识，在互助中得到提高，也必须在已有的基础上进行个人的独立钻研。
    特别是在高等学校，为了毕业后能够独立进行工作和独立进行科学研究，同学们的学习就更应该是具有独创性的活动，个人独立钻研应该成为同学们自学的主要方式。
    其实，任何学问，如果要学习得好，都必须自己下刻苦钻研的工夫。自己的努力是主要的，别人的帮助只能是次要的。大家都记得马克思的名言：“在科学上面是没有平坦的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点”，这句名言，应该成为每个从事学习的青年的座右铭。中国老话说：“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，没有认真深入的钻研，就不可能得到真正的领悟。因此，同在一个集体小组学习的同学，如果自己不刻苦钻研，虽然通过集体的帮助，也可以学到应该学的东西，但决不可能学得透彻，也不可能巩固，更不可能达到触类旁通，举一反三的地步。有的人自己没有认真钻研，但由于集体的帮助，考试也得了五分，自己说：“东听听，西听听，考起来也就差不多了”，这样的学习尽管也收到了眼前的成效，但实际上并没有得到真正的收获。
    伟大的革命导师马克思和恩格斯，他们在科学事业上共同亲密合作而又各自尽心钻研的事迹，可以作为我们青年同学在学习上把集体互助和个人钻研正确结合起来的范例。我们从“回忆马克思恩格斯”一书拉法格和李卜克内西所写的回忆中，可以看出他们两人在科学事业上如何进行共同的脑力劳动，如何习惯于共同工作，但同时他们又如何各自以很大的毅力钻研自己所需要和喜爱的科学。甚至马克思对数学，恩格斯对军事学都那样勤恳钻研而达到高度的造诣。而且他们虽然共同工作，相互间也并不完全依赖对方的特长而自己不加努力。例如马克思早年在纽约每日论坛报写通讯稿时，还没有精通英文，恩格斯就帮他翻译，但是后来马克思自己就精通英文，能用英文写作了。恩格斯的俄文是非常好的，但是马克思为了研究一些俄文农业资料，并没有完全依赖恩格斯，五十岁的时候还开始学俄文，在半年内就获得优异的成绩。他们亲密的互助合作而又各人刻苦钻研的精神，永远值得我们景仰和学习。
    有一些同志把集体学习和集体主义、个人钻研和个人主义联系起来，因而认为参加集体学习是走合作化是走红专的道路，而个人钻研则是“单干”，是走白专道路。这个认识是不完全正确的。我们在整风运动中曾经批判过一些只顾钻研业务，不过问政治，只专不红的人，但他们的错误并不在于不应该专，不应该刻苦钻研，而在于不愿意红，在政治上不求上进。他们从个人主义出发，一心想成名成家，这是不对的，但社会主义社会也需要工程师、科学家、文学家、艺术家等等；我们反对青年们的名利思想，但决不应反对青年们为将来成为工程师、科学家等等而作的正当的努力。青年学生们现在的刻苦钻研就是为未来从事建设事业或科学事业作准备，在学校中刻苦钻研所学的人愈多，我们未来的建设事业和科学水平就能够发展和提高得更快更好。
    祖国的经济建设正在高速度前进，科学文化事业正在蓬勃开展，我们需要大批又红又专的工程师、科学家、文学家、艺术家和各项建设干部，这就要求青年同学们在学校中刻苦钻研，顽强学习，攻破科学技术堡垒。在学习过程中，彼此互相帮助，共同提高，是完全必要的，但是个人的独立钻研，也是完全不应该忽视的。任何强调一方面而忽视另一方面的想法和做法都是对提高学习水平不利的。只有根据不同课程不同年级的具体情况把集体学习和个人钻研恰当地结合起来，才是提高学习水平的正确道路。这是每个青年同学所必须认识，也是每个从事教育工作的同志们所应该注意的。
