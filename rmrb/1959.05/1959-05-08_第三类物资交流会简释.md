Brief Explanation of the Third Category of Materials Exchange Fair

　　In our country, commodities are currently managed in three categories. The first and second categories of commodities have all been directly included in the national plan, and are allocated by the state according to the plan and by the state according to the plan for differential allocation. Among them, there are thirty-eight kinds belonging to the first category, such as grain, cotton, and cotton cloth, and two hundred and ninety-three kinds belonging to the second category, such as round nails, iron wire, and live pigs. In addition to the first and second categories, materials under unified allocation managed by relevant departments, and certain commodities for which the state has other explicit regulations, other commodities such as carrying poles, baskets, native pesticides, minor fruits, minor medicinal materials, vegetables with small yields, small handicrafts, etc., all belong to the third category of commodities. These commodities are numerous in variety, generally produced in a decentralized manner, and highly variable, making it impossible for the state to implement direct planned management of all of them.

　　Holding third-category materials exchange conferences at each level is to organize the circulation and distribution of third-category commodities in a planned way. It is held after the completion of the comprehensive socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, agriculture, and handicrafts, the disappearance of the free market, and the direct inclusion of the distribution of first and second categories of materials between urban and rural areas into the national plan. Therefore, it is different from the materials exchange conferences during the period of national economic recovery. The current exchange conference mainly aims to properly allocate third-category commodities by signing spot contracts, futures contracts, and agreements for supply and demand, and to promote the circulation of such commodities. Therefore, this kind of exchange conference is one of the important forms of planned commodity distribution under the socialist system.

　　第三类物资交流会简释
    我们国家的商品目前分为三类进行管理。第一、二类商品已全部直接列入国家计划，分别由国家按计划分配和由国家按计划实行差额调拨。其中属于第一类的有粮食、棉花、棉布等三十八种，属于第二类的有元钉、铁丝、生猪等二百九十三种。除了一、二类和统一分配由有关部门管理的物资以及国家另有明文规定的某些商品以外，其他的商品如扁担、箩筐、土农药、小宗水果、小药材、产量不大的蔬菜、小手工艺品等等，都属于第三类商品。这类商品品种繁多，一般又是生产分散，变动性大，不可能全部由国家实行直接的计划管理。
    逐级召开第三类物资交流大会，是为了有计划地组织第三类商品的流通和分配。它是在国家对资本主义工商业、农业和手工业全面的社会主义改造已经完成，自由市场已经消失，城乡间第一、二类物资的分配全部已直接纳入国家计划的条件下召开的，因此与国民经济恢复时期的那种物资交流会不同。现在的这种交流会，主要是通过签订供需现货合同、期货合同和协议，对第三类商品加以适当的分配，促进这类商品的流通。因此，这种交流会是社会主义制度下整个商品有计划分配的重要形式之一。
