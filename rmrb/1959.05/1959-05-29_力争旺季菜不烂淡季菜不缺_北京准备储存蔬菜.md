    Strive to Prevent Vegetable Rot During Peak Season and Shortages During Off-Season
    Beijing Prepares to Store Vegetables

    (Our Dispatch) With the peak vegetable season approaching, Beijing's vegetable supply departments, in the spirit of "urban and rural areas working together," are vigorously carrying out various preparations for vegetable storage, processing, and pickling to regulate vegetable supply during peak and off-peak seasons.

    To meet the growing needs of urban people's lives, Beijing has expanded its vegetable planting area this year. It is estimated that the market supply of commercial vegetables around July this year may increase by more than 40% compared with the same period last year. Judging from the current vegetable growth, if there are no special disasters, the output of commercial vegetables during the peak season will exceed market sales. To prevent vegetable rot during the peak season and ensure vegetables are available during the off-season, Beijing's vegetable supply departments are actively planning to mobilize the masses who grow and eat vegetables to store, process, and pickle vegetables while vigorously storing and processing them themselves.

    Currently, in addition to repairing more than 2,000 vegetable storage cellars, 500 pickling ponds, and a vegetable processing plant near the vegetable production areas, commercial departments will also make full use of existing equipment. Renovation of the original 200-plus pickling cellars has begun, and more than 10,000 pickling vats have been emptied. More than 20 vegetable stations across the city have also vacated dozens of rooms to be used as drying rooms, ready to dry leafy vegetables. Some vegetable stations have also prepared large pots, bottles, and other utensils for processing tomato sauce and tomato juice during the peak season.

    According to surveys, agencies, organizations, and urban and rural residents also have great potential for storing and processing pickled vegetables. Relevant units recently conducted surveys in 13 units, including the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, Beijing No. 2 Boys' Middle School, Beijing Normal University, and Xinhua Printing Factory. Among them, eight units have pickling vats with a pickling capacity of about 60,000 jin. Among 82 households in Baizhifang in Xuanwu District, Jiutiao in Dongcheng District, and No. 5 Branch Factory in Xicheng District, 40 households have vegetable vats that can pickle more than 3,000 jin of vegetables. Suburban farmers have traditionally pickled vegetables. Each canteen of the Dong Sheng People's Commune in Haidian District has more than 3,000 pickling vats, and almost every household in this commune has one vat. The Dahongmen Station of the Nanyuan People's Commune has prepared more than 4,000 pickling vats, each of which can pickle dozens to hundreds of jin of vegetables. According to statistics from seven districts in urban and suburban areas, more than 40,000 pickling vats and more than 40 pickling ponds have been prepared, as well as some drying equipment. After these existing facilities are fully utilized, more than 26.6 million jin of vegetables can be pickled. The Sijiqing, Huangtugang, and other people's communes with relatively high vegetable production have made preliminary arrangements for the storage of autumn cabbage, radishes, and potatoes, in addition to making full preparations for the storage of summer vegetables.

    In order to assist agencies, organizations, and street residents in doing a good job in this year's vegetable storage and processing work, and to ensure the quality of vegetable storage, processing, and pickling, vegetable supply departments in various districts of Beijing are now holding small-scale symposiums, sample exhibitions, and organizing technical personnel with experience in storing, processing, and pickling vegetables to exchange experiences. They have also printed written materials introducing methods for processing and pickling eight kinds of vegetables such as cucumbers, string beans, and tomatoes, and introducing them to the masses. This year, if the various vegetables processed and pickled by people's communes and urban and rural residents are surplus to their own needs and they wish to sell them, the state will be responsible for purchasing them.

### 力争旺季菜不烂淡季菜不缺  北京准备储存蔬菜

    力争旺季菜不烂淡季菜不缺
    北京准备储存蔬菜
    本报讯　蔬菜旺季即将到来，北京市蔬菜供应部门本着“城乡齐动手”的精神，正在大搞蔬菜储存加工腌制的各项准备工作，以调节淡旺季节蔬菜供应。
    为适应城市人民生活日益增长的需要，今年北京市扩大了蔬菜种植面积，预计今年商品蔬菜7月前后上市量可能比去年同期增加40％以上。从目前蔬菜生长情况来看，如无特殊灾害，旺季商品菜的产量将超过市场销量。为了作到旺季蔬菜不烂，淡季有菜吃，北京市蔬菜供应部门在大力贮存加工的同时，正在积极筹划发动种菜、吃菜的广大群众贮存和加工腌制蔬菜。
    现在，商业部门，除在产菜区就近整修好两千多间贮菜土窖、五百个腌菜池和一个蔬菜加工厂以外，还将充分利用旧有设备。现在对原有的二百多间腌窖已开始整修，并腾出了一万多口腌菜缸。全市二十多个菜站也腾出了几十个房间作烘干室，准备烘干叶菜。有的菜站还准备了旺季加工西红柿酱、西红柿汁用的大锅、瓶子等用具。
    据调查，机关、团体和城乡居民贮存加工腌制的设备潜力也很大。有关单位最近在北京第三棉纺织厂、北京男子第二中学、北京师范大学、新华印刷厂等十三个单位进行了调查，其中有八个单位就拥有腌菜能力达六万斤左右的腌菜缸。宣武区的白纸坊、东城区九条和西城区五分厂的八十二户居民中，四十户有菜缸，能腌制蔬菜三千多斤。郊区农民以往多有腌菜习惯，海淀区东升人民公社各个食堂有腌菜缸三千多口，这个公社差不多每户有一口缸。南苑人民公社大红门站已准备好了四千多口腌菜缸，每口缸可腌制蔬菜几十斤到一百斤。城郊七个区统计，已经准备好了腌菜缸四万多口，腌菜池四十多个，还有一部分烘干设备。这些旧有设备充分利用后，可腌制二千六百多万斤蔬菜。四季青、黄土岗等产菜较多的人民公社，除对夏季蔬菜贮存作了充分准备以外，对秋后大白菜、大罗卜、土豆贮存工作也作了初步安排。
    北京市各区蔬菜供应部门为了协助机关、团体和街道居民作好今年蔬菜贮存加工工作，保证蔬菜贮存加工腌制的质量，现在除了分别举行小型座谈、样品展览以及组织贮存加工腌制蔬菜有技术的人员交流经验外，还印制了加工腌制黄瓜、豆角、西红柿等八种蔬菜方法的书面材料，向群众介绍。今年人民公社和城乡居民加工腌制的各种蔬菜，自用有余如愿意出售时，国家将负责收购。　（张志清）
