Xinhua News Agency, 30th, New York Dispatch: American monopoly capitalist newspapers applaud Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the Indian Parliament on the Tibet issue on the 27th. The "New York Herald Tribune" on the 29th wrote, "It is very likely that people will not forget Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the Indian Parliament on Monday, regarding it as one of the most important events in his career."

This newspaper believes that Nehru's attitude "has always seemed annoying" to the United States and its allies, "but signs of a change in attitude can be clearly seen in Monday's speech. Nehru asked Indian newspapers and Indian officials to use 'moderate and precise' language, but he himself chose unusually harsh wording."

The newspaper continued: "Nehru's rebuttal of various accusations was civilized and rational. He emphasized that he would continue to work for Sino-Indian friendship, but his words that 'a tragedy occurred in Tibet' have obviously shaken his original views." The newspaper said, "Perhaps this is what he (Nehru) meant when he told Parliament that China's words and deeds 'may have far-reaching consequences.'"

The newspaper also said with great interest that now, "a wave of anger against Beijing has suddenly swept across Asia, and if Nehru is moving with this wave, no matter how subtle, that is big news."

The "New York Times" also greatly praised Nehru's speech on the 29th, and even said that Nehru's speech had refuted the so-called "Communist China's lies thoroughly."

The newspaper then vilified China, saying that "the Tibet incident has shown a new type of imperialism in the modern world." The newspaper took the opportunity to instigate, "Is it too much to hope that Mr. Nehru and other responsible figures in neutralist countries can learn full lessons from the Tibet incident and thus revise their policies?"

The "Christian Science Monitor" published in Boston on the 29th described Nehru's speech as "astute and effective." According to this newspaper, Nehru's approach was to "first draw people's attention to the fact that Beijing chose bayonets as its weapons, and then presumptuously choose pillows as its own weapons." The newspaper said, "In circumstances where a full-scale battle is determined to be impossible, pillows can be very effective against bayonets." But this newspaper did not explain how China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion would become a "bayonet" that India needed to "effectively deal with."

    美国报纸大捧尼赫鲁的讲话
    夸奖他对我国采取了异常激烈的措辞
    满意他正在随着反对中国的浪潮前进
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：美国垄断资产阶级报纸为印度总理尼赫鲁27日在印度人民院关于西藏问题的讲话拍手叫好。29日的“纽约先驱论坛报”写道，“十分可能，人们将不会忘记尼赫鲁总理星期一在印度议会里的讲话，把它看作是他的生涯中最重要的事件之一。”
    这家报纸认为，对于美国和美国的盟国来说，尼赫鲁的态度“一直似乎是令人恼火的”，“但是在星期一的谈话中可以清楚地看到态度改变的迹象。尼赫鲁要求印度的报纸和印度的官员们使用‘温和确切的’语言，可是他自己却选择了异乎寻常地激烈的措辞”。
    这家报纸接着说：“尼赫鲁对各种指责的驳斥是斯文识理的。他强调表示他将继续为印中友谊而努力，但是他所说的‘西藏发生了悲剧’的话显然已经动摇了他原来的观点。”报纸说，“也许，这就是他（尼赫鲁）对议会说中国的言行‘可能有深远后果’的时候的意思。”
    这家报纸还兴致勃勃地说，现在，“整个亚洲突然掀起了一股反对北平的愤怒的浪潮，如果说尼赫鲁正在随着这一浪潮前进，不论是在多么细微的程度上，那都是一则大消息。”
    “纽约时报”29日也对尼赫鲁的讲话大为捧场，它竟然说，尼赫鲁的讲话已经把所谓“共产党中国的谎话驳得体无完肤”。
    这家报纸接着对中国进行谩骂，说什么“西藏事件已经说明现代世界上出现了一种新的帝国主义”，报纸乘机煽惑说，“人们希望尼赫鲁先生和其他中立主义国家的负责人物能够从西藏事件中取得充分的教训，以及从而修正他们的政策，难道这种希望过高了吗？”
    在波士顿出版的“基督教科学箴言报”29日把尼赫鲁的讲话说成是“精明而灵验的”。照这家报纸看来，尼赫鲁的作法是“先请人家注意北京选了刺刀做它的武器，然后就自负地选择枕头作自己的武器。”报纸说：“在环境决定不可能发生全面战斗的情况下，枕头是能够非常有效地对付刺刀的。”但是这家报纸没有说明中国平息西藏叛乱这件事怎么竟会成为需要印度“非常有效地对付”的“刺刀”。
