Heroes Conquer Wind and Rain
    —On the Fight Against Disaster and for Seedling Protection in Sanmao Commune, Yangzhong County
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Weicai
    The Sanmao Commune in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, has more than 11,000 mu of three wheat crops (Yu Mai, wheat, and barley). After careful processing and management by the masses of the entire commune throughout the winter and spring, most of them were growing very well. Not long ago, just as the Yu Mai was heading, they suddenly encountered two consecutive days and nights of torrential rain (interspersed with light rain), and the low-lying polder fields accumulated a lot of water, and the high polder fields also had four or five inches of water in the drainage ditches. At the same time, an eighth-grade gale swept through, and the area of wheat seedlings that were flattened increased from more than 100 mu before the rain to more than 1,000 mu.

    The attack of wind and rain did not frighten or shake the ambition of the people of Sanmao Commune to strive for a bumper harvest of three wheat crops. Even when it was raining and the wind was blowing, the Party organizations of the commune and various management districts led the masses in an intense struggle to fight disaster, save seedlings, and seize grain from nature. The commune Party committee promptly studied and adopted emergency measures to fight disaster and save seedlings. The entire commune invested 70% of its labor force in drainage and 30% of its labor force in making preparations for rescuing flattened wheat seedlings. The Party convened mobilization rallies to declare war on strong winds and heavy rains, from within the Party to outside the Party, in each management district. Cadres and the masses braved the rain to engage in waterlogging drainage. The slogans they raised were: "The wind is strong, the rain is heavy, but our determination is even greater, and our lofty aspirations soar to the sky!" "Persist to the last second, don't relax until the water is completely drained!" Suddenly, the fields were filled with people draining water, and the sounds of waterwheels, work songs, and wind and rain were intertwined.

    In order to drain the water from the wheat fields in time, the entire commune was divided into three areas, with the Party secretary and committee members directing the battle separately. Brigade cadres were assigned to production teams, production team cadres were assigned to lead commune members, and commune members were assigned to specific plots of land. At the same time, the commune adopted a four-pronged approach, using more than 1,500 people to operate waterwheels to drain water; using more than 1,300 people to dredge river channels and reinforce river dikes; using more than 800 people to improve the drainage system; and using more than 300 people to manage water outlets, responsible for releasing water, ensuring that each water outlet had a dedicated person to manage it, on duty day and night.

    In this intense battle against disaster and for seedling protection, cadres and the masses overcame the many difficulties caused by strong winds and heavy rains with a tenacious revolutionary will. They continued to work even when their clothes were soaked, and they got up and continued to work even when they were blown over by the wind, with no one leaving the "front line." They said heroically, "The rain cannot wash away our determination, and the wind cannot blow down our energy!" Shu Shanhai, a member of the commune Party committee and secretary of the Hero Management District branch, led more than 100 male and female commune members to the fields early in the morning, braving the pea-sized raindrops and eighth-grade winds. He personally worked with the commune members to set up 28 waterwheels, dredged 16 dam heads, and drained water along with the commune members. At night, he went to various places to check the drainage situation and drain water with the masses, not closing his eyes all night. Under his leadership, the cadres and the masses worked harder and harder. After only a day and a night of fighting, the water in all 1,660 mu of wheat fields was drained. Fang Maolin, secretary of the Chuidong Management District branch, dug more than 60 openings one morning while organizing commune members to drain water. The entire management district set up 21 waterwheels, draining water day and night. After the heavy rain stopped, the water in the fields was basically drained. Shi Guanglan, Yuan Youdi, Yuan Lingdi, Xiao Lanbao and other four young female commune members from the sixth production team of this management district fell into the river when the waterwheel's collapse pillow was blown down by a gust of wind while they were operating the waterwheel in the rain. They immediately climbed out of the river and continued to fight the wind and rain, re-erecting the waterwheel to drain water. They said heroically, "We will not leave until all the water in the fields is drained!" The axle turned faster than before, and the water splashed even higher.

    After two days and two nights of fighting, the water in all 11,000 mu of wheat fields was drained, and there was no waterlogging damage.

    After the strong winds and heavy rains stopped, each production team took different rescue measures according to the different lodging situations. All the lodged wheat in the entire commune was straightened up in just a few days.

    Now the commune is carrying out a "four prevention movement" to prevent wind, prevent waterlogging, prevent late frost, and prevent pests and diseases to ensure a bumper harvest of three wheat crops.

    英雄们战胜了狂风暴雨
    ——记扬中县三茅公社抗灾救苗的斗争
    本报记者　姜伟才
    江苏扬中县三茅公社共有一万一千多亩三麦（元麦、小麦、大麦），经过全公社群众一冬一春精细加工管理，大都生长得很好。不久前，正当元麦抽穗时，突然遇到连续两昼夜的暴雨（间有小雨）袭击，低洼圩田积水很多，高圩田墒沟的积水也有四、五寸深。同时，还刮起了八级大风，倒伏的麦苗由雨前的一百多亩增加到一千多亩。
    狂风暴雨的袭击，丝毫没有吓住或是动摇三茅公社人民力争三麦丰产的雄心大志。就在下大雨刮大风的时候，公社和各个管理区的党组织领导群众进行了一场激烈的抗灾救苗、与天争粮的斗争。公社党委及时研究和采取了抗灾救苗的紧急措施，全公社以70％的劳力投入排水，以30％的劳力做好抢救倒伏麦苗的各项准备工作，各个管理区都由党内到党外召开了向大风大雨宣战的誓师大会，干部群众都冒雨投入排涝。他们提出的口号是：“风大雨大没有决心大，壮志凌云冲九霄！”“坚持到最后一秒钟，水不排尽不放松！”顿时，田野里到处是排水的人群，水车声、号子声和风雨声交织在一起。
    为了及时排除麦田积水，全公社划分三个片，由党委书记、委员分头指挥战斗，大队的干部都分工包生产队，生产队的干部分工领导社员，社员分块包田。同时，公社采取分兵四路的办法，以一千五百多人车水排涝；以一千三百多人疏通河港和加固江堤；以八百多人整理排水系统；以三百多人管理水洞，负责放水，做到每个水洞都有专人管理，日夜轮班看守。
    在这场抗灾救苗的紧张战斗中，干部群众都以顽强的革命意志，克服了风大雨大的重重困难。他们衣服淋湿了照常干，被风刮倒了爬起来继续干，没一个人下“火线”。他们豪迈地说：“雨淋不掉决心，风吹不倒干劲！”公社党委委员、英雄管理区支部书记束善海，一大早冒着豆大的雨珠和八级大风，带领一百多个男女社员赶赴田间，亲自和社员们一起架起二十八部水车，疏通了十六个坝头，并和社员一起车水排涝。夜里，他去各处检查排水情况，和群众一起排水，整整一夜没有合眼。在他的带动下，干部群众越干越有劲，只经过一天一夜的战斗，全部排尽了一千六百六十多亩麦田的积水。圌东管理区支部书记方茂林在组织社员排水时，一个早上就挖了六十多个缺口，全管理区架起二十一部水车，日夜不停地排水。大雨一停，田里的积水也基本排尽。这个管理区第六生产队的施光兰、袁友弟、袁领弟、小兰保等四个青年女社员，在冒雨车水时，一阵大风把水车的塌枕吹倒，四个人都跌倒在河里，她们立即从河里爬起来，继续和风雨交战，重新架起水车车水。她们豪迈地说：“不排尽田里水，坚决不走！”车轴比原来转得更快，水也溅得更高。
    经过两天两夜战斗，一万一千多亩麦田的积水全部排尽了，未受一点涝害。
    在大风大雨停息以后，各个生产队都根据不同的倒伏情况，采取不同的抢救措施。全公社所有的倒伏麦子，只几天时间就立直起来。
    现在这个公社又开展防风、防涝、防晚霜、防病虫害的“四防运动”，确保三麦丰收。
