Ten Thousand People in the Capital Watch Military Sports Performance

(Our report) The Second Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a brilliant military sports performance at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan on the 10th. This performance consisted of three parts: motorcycle stunts, military relay, and air force rollers. The performers' courageous and fearless spirit, skillful and superb combat skills, fully demonstrated the PLA's strong combat qualities and powerful military strength, leaving an unforgettable impression on more than 10,000 spectators in the capital.

Yesterday afternoon, the weather in Beijing was gloomy, with drizzling rain. At 3:30 PM, a green signal flare soared into the sky. Then, the sound of engines rang out from a corner of the performance field. A motorcycle light cavalry team composed of ten officers and seventeen soldiers, led by Yang Zhenwu, who had participated in the Jinan, Crossing-the-Yangtze, and other campaigns and had been awarded five meritorious services, sped into the performance field. Nine two-wheeled motorcycles and nine three-wheeled motorcycles were arranged in the shape of "August 1," circling the entire field. This showed that the excellent soldiers will forever inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army and forever hold high the "August 1" military flag to advance from victory to even greater victories.

Then, the team performed a thrilling ambush battle. From the discovery of the enemy's concealed driving to the annihilation of the enemy, it only took two or three minutes. The riders sometimes lay down on the vehicle; sometimes squatted to the left of the vehicle to hide; sometimes accelerated forward; sometimes turned sharply backward in place; sometimes took off their hands from the handlebars and put on gas masks, passing through the contaminated area. The field was filled with gunshots and dust, like thousands of troops fighting on the battlefield.

The battle ended. The brave men, filled with the joy of victory, performed various stunts such as "Yan Style Balance" and "Flying Wheel Tire Change" on the vehicles, and drove over obstacles more than one meter high, crossed single-plank bridges, and flew over broken bridges more than two meters high and four meters two long, and fire barriers with flames soaring into the sky. These thrilling performances received warm applause from the audience.

Then, four more colored signal flares flew into the sky above the west field of Xian Nong Tan, and the military obstacle performance began. Two teams of fully armed soldiers gathered at the starting point of the attack. Four engineers in two groups quickly and nimbly approached the "enemy's" forward positions, performing various actions such as cutting barbed wire and sweeping mines. Chemical soldiers followed closely behind, crawling forward, and conducting chemical reconnaissance in the "enemy's" poison zone. With two loud "boom" sounds, the explosives bravely destroyed the two bunkers at the "enemy's" forward positions. Immediately, flame throwers conducted destructive fire on two deep bunkers of the "enemy," and the long flames were like two fire dragons.

In a moment, the infantry unit began to charge under the fire cover of light and heavy machine guns. They passed through the dangerous single-plank bridge and the high plank barrier, then jumped over the wooden fence, and engaged in a bayonet fight with the simulated enemy. The audience watched this performance with bated breath, as if they saw the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the battlefield in those years. When the red flag fluttered in the sky above the occupied position, the whole field cheered and roared, and everyone felt proud that we had such brave and powerful defenders of the motherland.

The gunshots stopped, and the smoke dissipated. A team of two hundred soldiers from various air force units, wearing white pants and blue shirts, led by a large red flag, carrying the red characters "Develop Sports, Strengthen People's Physique" and "Congratulations on the Victory of the Second Military Sports Meet" composed of rollers, marched from the east of the square towards the rostrum in the west, stepping on the "People's Liberation Army March." The roller performance began. The roller performance showed various patterns such as turbines, harvesters, plum blossoms, and surging waves, making the audience feel as if they were standing next to a huge turbine, hearing its roaring sound; as if they were standing on the coast, seeing the滔滔 surging waves; and as if they had walked into an orchard in early spring, smelling the fragrance of blooming plum blossoms. Finally, two hundred soldiers rolled more than fifty rollers into a huge and beautiful five-pointed star in the center of the square, and the announcer's voice came from the loudspeaker: "The five-pointed star, it is a shining golden star, ... it symbolizes the wisdom of the Party's leadership! ... Let our great motherland ... forever shine like a golden star!" At this time, pairs of colored balloons rose from the center of the performance field and soared into the sky. The balloons carried slogans written on various colored silks, such as "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The whole field cheered and roared, and the performance ended.

    首都万人观看军事体育表演
    本报讯　中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会10日在北京先农坛举行了一场精采的军事体育表演。这场表演由摩托车特技、军事接力和空军滚轮三个部分组成。表演者勇猛无畏的精神，熟练高超的战斗技能，充分体现了解放军战斗素质的强健和军事威力的强大，给首都一万多观众留下了难忘的印象。
    昨天下午，北京天气阴霾，细雨霏霏。三时三十分，一颗绿色信号弹腾空而起。接着，在表演场的一角响起了马达声。一支由十名军官和十七名士兵组成的摩托轻骑队在参加过济南、渡江等战役，荣立过五次战功的杨振武的率领下驰进表演场，九辆两轮摩托车和九辆三轮摩托车排列成“八一”字形绕行全场。它显示：优秀的战士们将永远继承和发扬人民解放军的光荣传统，永远高举“八一”军旗从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    接着，车队表演了一场惊险的遭遇战。从发现敌人隐蔽驾驶开始到消灭敌人，只有两、三分钟。只见骑手们忽而卧倒车上；忽而蹲向车左藏身；忽而加油急驰；忽而原地急向后转；忽而双手脱把带上防毒面具，通过染毒地带。场上枪声鼎沸，灰尘滚滚，宛如千军万马鏖战沙场。
    战斗结束了。勇士们怀着胜利的喜悦，在车上作了“燕式平衡”、“飞轮换胎”等各种特技表演，并驶过一公尺多高的障碍，驰过独木桥，飞越了两公尺多高四公尺二长的断桥和烈焰冲天的火障。这些惊心动魄的表演，获得观众热烈掌声。
    接着，先农坛西场上空又飞起了四颗彩色信号弹，军事障碍表演开始了。两队全副武装的战士齐集在进攻出发地。只见四个工兵分两路迅速敏捷地接近了“敌人”的前沿阵地，表演了剪铁丝网、扫雷等各种动作。化学兵紧跟在后面匍匐前进，在“敌人”放毒区进行化学侦察。随着“轰”“轰”两声巨响，炸破手勇敢地将“敌人”前沿的两座地堡炸毁。随即火焰喷射器“向敌人”纵深两个地堡进行摧毁射击，长长的火苗，犹如两条火龙。
    一会儿，步兵分队在轻重机枪的火力掩护下开始冲锋。他们通过险要的独木桥和高高的板障，再跳过木栅，并且和假设敌人进行了白刃战。观众们屏声静气地观看着这场表演，仿佛看到了当年人民解放军奋战疆场的英雄形象。当红旗飞扬在占领阵地的上空时，全场欢声雷动，人人都为我们有这样英勇强大的祖国捍卫者感到骄傲。
    枪声停止，硝烟飞散。一队来自空军各部队的二百名战士，穿着白裤蓝衣，在一面红色大旗的响导下，抬着用滚轮组成的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”“祝全军第二届运动大会胜利”的红色大字，踏着“解放军进行曲”，迈步从广场的东面向西面的主席台走来。滚轮表演开始了。滚轮表演出涡轮机、收割机、梅花、涌浪等各种图案，使观众好似站在巨大的涡轮机旁，听到了它那轰隆的吼声；好似伫立大海之滨，看到了滔滔涌浪；又好似走进了早春的果园，闻到了盛开的梅花芳香。最后二百名战士滚着五十多个滚轮在广场中央叠成一个巨大美观的五角星，扩音器内传来解说员的声音：“五角星，它是一颗光辉四射的金星，……它标志着党领导的英明！……让我们伟大的祖国……永远像金星一样四射光芒！”这时，成双成对的彩色气球从表演场中央腾空而起，直冲云霄。气球下带着各种彩绸写的“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等标语。全场欢声雷动，表演结束。
