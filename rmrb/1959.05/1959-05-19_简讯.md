    Shaanxi Expedites Highway Construction
    Shaanxi Province is accelerating the construction of four major highways.

    This year, Shaanxi Province plans to build more than 400 kilometers of major highways. The four currently under construction are: the Xi'an-Wanyuan (Sichuan) Highway, the Zhouzhi-Foping Highway, the Hua County-Jinchengdui Highway, and the Daning-Dalin (Ningqiang Da'an - Lueyang Heimulin) Highway. Among them, the Hua-Jin, Xi-Wan, and Zhou-Fo highways are being built in the eastern, central, and western parts of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province, respectively, connecting the Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi regions. They will play an important role in promoting economic development in southern Shaanxi and the Qinling mountain areas.

    Guangdong Coal Mines Build Narrow-Gauge Railways
    Nine key coal-producing areas in Guangdong Province, including Lianyang, are building narrow-gauge railways for coal mines.

    Key coal mining areas in Lianyang, Nanling, Luojiadu, Quren, Hua County, Sanshui, Ma'an, Shigu, and Yangchun in Guangdong Province were all newly opened last year. Due to inadequate transportation, more than one million tons of coal have been stockpiled, waiting to be shipped out. To address this, relevant leading departments in Guangdong Province have been actively organizing resources since January this year to construct narrow-gauge railways.

    Wuhan Produces Aureomycin
    The Wuhan Antibiotic Factory officially started production on the 13th.

    The factory began preparations for construction in April last year.

    Antibiotics are a new achievement in global medical science and technology, and they are scarce and valuable medicines. In the past, most of the antibiotics used for medical treatment in Wuhan were imported. After this factory's five-ton aureomycin equipment is put into production, it can produce aureomycin in batches, a special drug for treating typhoid fever, pertussis, pneumonia, meningitis, and other diseases. This equipment can also be used to produce chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and other antibiotic drugs with even better efficacy than aureomycin.

    广东煤矿修轻便铁路
    广东省连阳等九个重点产煤区正在兴建煤矿专用轻便铁路。
    广东省连阳、南岭、罗家渡、曲仁、花县、三水、马鞍、石鼓、阳春等重点煤矿产区都是去年新开辟的，由于交通运输条件还没有跟上，到现在为止，已积存煤炭一百多万吨，等待外运。为此，广东省有关领导部门从今年1月份起，就积极组织力量，建设轻便铁路。
    武汉生产金霉素
    武汉抗菌素厂已于13日正式开工生产。
    这个厂是去年4月开始筹建的。
    抗菌素是目前世界医药科学技术上一项新的成就，它是一种稀缺的贵重药品。以往武汉市医疗上所用的抗菌素大多依靠进口，这个厂五吨金霉素设备投入生产后，即可成批地生产治疗伤寒、百日咳、肺炎、脑膜炎等的特效药——金霉素，利用这个设备还可生产比金霉素疗效更高的土霉素、四圜素等抗菌素类药品。
