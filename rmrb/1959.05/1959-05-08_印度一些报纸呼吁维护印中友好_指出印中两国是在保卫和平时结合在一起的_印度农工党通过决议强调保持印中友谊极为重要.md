Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th - The Tamil newspaper "New India" (published in Madras) of the Indian National Congress published an editorial on the 6th, saying that the rapid deterioration of relations between India and China should arouse deep concern among people of correct thinking all over the world.

The newspaper said that, as Nehru rightly warned, India should be careful not to let the Tibetan dispute be used by the pro-American faction in the Indian Parliament who oppose China.

The newspaper emphasized that "to continue to maintain good-neighborly relations with the great Chinese people is a historical necessity. Do not let our anger blind our eyes, leading us to break with our traditional friends. Nehru is right to reiterate his belief in Panchsheel."

The newspaper believes that the Chinese are "angered by [India] giving refuge to the God-King (referring to the Dalai Lama) and other lamas. One should hope that with the passage of time, this anger will subside, and normal friendly relations between the two countries will be restored."

The Indian Tamil newspaper "People's Power" published an editorial on the 6th, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai is intentionally avoiding making unfriendly remarks about India, even though China is rightfully indignant at the anti-China accusations published in the Indian press and forums.

The newspaper said, "Especially at a time when China is quelling the upper-class reactionary armed rebellion that is undermining its national sovereignty, such criticism should provoke a natural reaction in China, which is not beyond human comprehension. But fundamentally, China has friendship towards India. Historically, India and China have been united in defending world peace."

The newspaper said that the Indian constitution does not allow any rights that hinder friendly relations. Any discussion of China's internal affairs will incur the same interference from other countries. For example, the US Senate could make India extremely embarrassed. The newspaper said, "But, one can believe that China will not do this, just as it will not tolerate any interference in its own internal affairs."

The newspaper called for attention to the pressure from domestic and international reactionaries who want to set India and China against each other. It said, "President Eisenhower's praise of Nehru's position is merely an attempt to divide China and India."

The newspaper said that the Chinese should recognize that, apart from a few people, the Indian masses hope to maintain friendly relations with China. It said: "Nehru is the most unwilling to do anything that would hinder this friendship. A moderate attitude will help everyone thwart the imperialist conspiracy to economically—and of course, if possible, politically—divide and rule Asia.”

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th - According to a PTI (Press Trust of India) Bombay report, the Central Committee of the Indian Peasants and Workers Party, meeting in Bombay on May 4th, passed a resolution emphasizing that maintaining friendship between India and China is extremely important.

The resolution said that the friendship between India and China is not only a powerful bulwark for peace in Asia, but also a powerful bulwark for peace in the world.

The resolution believes that the current accusations and counter-accusations between India and China have endangered relations between the two countries.

The resolution said that the task facing Tibet is to eliminate backwardness and establish democracy and socialism.

The resolution believes that cooperation between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama, who is currently in "voluntary exile" in India, is in the interest of the Tibetan people.

　　印度一些报纸呼吁维护印中友好
    指出印中两国是在保卫和平时结合在一起的
    印度农工党通过决议强调保持印中友谊极为重要
    新华社新德里7日电　印度国大党的泰米尔文报纸“新印度报”（在马德拉斯出版）6日发表社论说，印度和中国之间关系的迅速恶化，应该引起全世界具有正确思想的人们的深切忧虑。
    这家报纸说，正如尼赫鲁所正确警告的那样，印度应当小心谨慎，以免西藏纠纷被印度议会反对中国的亲美派所利用。
    这家报纸强调说，“同伟大的中国人民继续保持睦邻关系，这是历史必然性。不要让我们的怒气蒙蔽了我们的眼睛，以致于同我们传统的朋友决裂。尼赫鲁重申，信仰潘查希拉，这做得对”。
    这家报纸认为，中国人，“由于（印度）让神王（指达赖喇嘛）和其他的喇嘛避难而发怒了。人们应该希望，随着时间的消逝，这种愤怒情绪将会平息下去，两国正常的友好关系将再度恢复”。
    印度泰米尔文报纸“人民力量”6日发表社论说，周恩来总理有意避免发表对印度不友好的言论，尽管中国对印度报刊和讲坛上发表的反对中国的指责正当地感到愤慨。
    这家报纸说，“特别是在中国正在平定破坏它的国家主权的上层反动武装叛乱的时候，这种批评应当在中国引起自然的反应，这一点也不超出人的理解力。但是从基本上来说，中国对印度存在着友谊。从历史上来说，印度和中国是在保卫全世界和平时结合在一起的。”
    这家报纸说，印度宪法并不容许任何妨碍友好关系的权利。对中国内政问题的任何讨论，将遭致来自其他国家的同样的干涉。例如，美国参议院就可以使印度极其难堪。这家报纸说，“但是，人们可以相信，中国不会这样做，正像它不会容忍对它自己的内政进行任何干涉一样。”
    这家报纸要求注意那些要想使印度和中国对立的国内和国际反动派的压力。它说，“艾森豪威尔总统赞扬尼赫鲁的立场，只不过是要想分化中国和印度罢了。”
    这家报纸说，中国人应该认识到，除了少数人以外，印度群众希望同中国保持友好关系。它说：“尼赫鲁是最不愿意作出任何会妨碍这种友谊的人。节制态度将帮助大家挫败帝国主义在经济上——当然，如果可能，在政治上——要想把亚洲分而治之的阴谋。”
    新华社新德里7日电　据印度报业托辣斯孟买消息，5月4日在孟买开会的印度农工党中央委员会通过决议强调指出，保持印度和中国之间的友谊是极为重要的。
    决议说，印度和中国的友谊不仅是亚洲和平的强大堡垒，而且是全世界和平的强大堡垒。
    决议认为，目前印度和中国之间的指责和反指责已经危及印中两国之间的关系。
    决议说，西藏所面临的任务是消除落后状态和建立民主与社会主义。
    决议认为中国政府同目前“自动流亡”在印度的达赖喇嘛之间的合作是符合西藏人民的利益的。
