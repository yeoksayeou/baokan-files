The Direction of Efforts for Young Intellectuals
Speech by Committee Member Zhou Li

I completely agree with and enthusiastically support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. Now, I would like to share my understanding of the direction of efforts for young intellectuals as indicated in Premier Zhou's report.

I am a scientific research worker. During the Great Leap Forward last year, our research institute, like other scientific research units across the country, basically completed within a relatively short period topics that were originally expected to take several years or more than a decade. Currently, we are trying to further cooperate with the national construction tasks and apply the research results from the laboratory to industrial production.

In terms of personnel composition, the vast majority of our institute, except for a few older and experienced technical personnel, are young people. When we young people accept the tasks assigned by the Party, on the one hand, we feel happy because the Party trusts us, leads us, and supports us to complete some arduous and glorious tasks; on the other hand, we feel worried because, in terms of our technical level and work experience, we are not yet confident of completing the tasks assigned by the Party on time. After a year of effort, we have made some achievements and initially met the first step requirements put forward by the Party. We deeply feel that the fundamental reason why we were able to achieve such results last year is first and foremost due to the correct leadership of the Party.

After the start of the Rectification Campaign, especially after the anti-Rightist struggle and the debate on the two roads, our young comrades clarified how to distinguish between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and began to grasp the corresponding relationship between being Red and expert, politics and technology, and theory and practice; thus, great changes have taken place in our ideological state and mental outlook. The general line put forward by the Party further spurred our enthusiasm, and we put all our energy into the cause of socialist construction to attack the scientific fortresses. When we encountered some difficulties after starting our work, the Party pointed out that we should despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically, which further boosted our fighting spirit. We also put forward pledge indicators and battle slogans, strengthened work deployment, and formulated phased battle plans and specific measures. After we obtained initial victories, the Party taught us that our work must become more and more meticulous, advocating practical calculation, arrangement, and inspection; and opposing exaggeration and concealment of shortcomings. In short, the Party is constantly teaching us, so that we can avoid detours in our work.

The Party often teaches us to follow the mass line in our work and to carry out mass movements. In the past, some people always believed that scientific research work could only be done by a few people behind closed doors and could not follow the mass line and carry out mass movements. The experience of the past year has proved that this view is wrong. During the Great Leap Forward last year, our research institute, based on its work tasks, organized young technical personnel and workers into many shock brigades, going wherever there were difficulties, and not retreating from the front line until the tasks were completed. We used collective wisdom and collective strength to attack the fortresses. Because everyone was involved in the battle and deeply involved in the work, we were able to discover the problems in the work; although our technical level was not high, we were able to discover problems because we were more deeply involved in practice, and everyone gathered their thoughts and ideas after discovering the problems. Workers can also play a role in scientific research because, in their actual work, they can put forward suggestions for improvement based on their understanding of the processes and equipment. In general, the central issue in this regard is that everyone discovers problems, concentrates them for research, and divides the responsibilities to solve them separately.

Our young people have great drive, and their enthusiasm is generally very high. They are willing to do their work well quickly; but our technical level is not high, and our experience is limited, so it is easy to have one-sidedness in our work. At this time, the older technical personnel working with us give us some tips and work with us to do the work well. This is because they have more practical experience and a higher level of scientific and technical expertise. I feel that the reason why young technical personnel and older technical personnel can carry out scientific research work together so well is not only because we young people can learn from the older technical personnel, but more importantly, we all have a common ideal: to strive to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. I fully agree with Premier Zhou's instructions in his report that young intellectuals should learn modestly from learned seniors, and all patriotic intellectuals should unite under the banner of socialism and work together to build our great motherland.

We are still very young, and the Party's cause has a great future. Our work last year was just the beginning. Based on last year's work experience, we deeply feel that we must adhere to the road of being both Red and expert. We will certainly follow the instructions in Premier Zhou's report, not be arrogant or complacent, constantly carry out self-transformation, diligently improve our professional level, and at the same time, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, participate in the practice of mass production and struggle, participate in physical labor, strictly demand ourselves politically and ideologically and in our work, learn modestly from learned seniors, and always move forward in the direction guided by the Party and Chairman Mao!

Finally, I also express my heartfelt support for the issue of Tibet mentioned in Premier Zhou's report. The complete failure of the armed rebellion launched by the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in betraying the motherland and undermining unity is a victory for the Tibetan people and a victory for all ethnic groups in the country. Any conspiracy to use the rebellion of Tibetan reactionaries to achieve ulterior motives is doomed to failure. The people of all ethnic groups in China will certainly unite more closely and, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, enter the great socialist and communist society together!

I wish the conference a successful victory! I wish all the committee members good health!

### 青年知识分子努力的方向  周立委员的发言

　　青年知识分子努力的方向
    周立委员的发言
    我完全同意并热烈拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长及李维汉副主席的报告。现在仅就周总理报告中所指示的青年知识分子今后努力方向问题，谈谈我的体会。
    我是一个科学研究工作者，在去年大跃进的过程中，我们研究院和全国其他科学研究单位一样，把原来预计要经过几年或十几年时间才能完成的题目，在比较短的时间内基本完成了。目前我们正在设法进一步的配合国家建设任务，把试验室内的研究成果，用之于工业生产上去。
    从人员的组成来说，我院除少数年长有经验的技术人员外，绝大多数是青年人；我们这些青年人由于从事科学研究工作的时间不久，所以在接受党交给的任务时，一方面感到高兴，因为党信任我们、领导我们并支持我们去完成一些艰巨的、光荣的任务；另一方面又感到担心，因为从我们的技术水平和工作经验来说，还没有把握按时完成党所交付的任务。经过了一年的努力，我们做出了一些成果，初步地达到了党所提出的第一步要求。我们深深地感到，去年所以能够达到这样结果的根本原因，首先归功于党的正确领导。
    整风运动开始之后，特别是经过反右斗争和两条道路的辩论后，使我们青年同志明确了如何划分敌我矛盾、人民内部矛盾，开始掌握了红与专，政治与技术，理论与实践的相应关系；从而在思想状况和精神面貌方面起了很大的变化。党所提出的总路线进一步鼓起了我们的积极性，把我们的全部精力投之于社会主义建设事业中，去攻打科学堡垒。当我们工作开展之后遇到一些困难时，党又指出应该在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，这样又进一步鼓起我们的斗志，并提出了献礼指标和战斗口号，加强了工作布署，制订了分段战斗的规划和具体措施。当我们获得了初步战果之后，党又教导我们工作一定要愈做愈细致，提倡切实的计算、安排和检查；反对浮夸及隐瞒缺点。总之，党是时时刻刻的教导着我们，使我们在工作中少走弯路。
    党经常教导我们工作中要走群众路线，要开展群众运动。过去有些人总认为科学研究工作只能少数人关起门来作，不能走群众路线和开展群众运动。一年来的经验证明，这种看法是错误的。在去年大跃进的过程中，我们研究院根据工作任务，把青年技术人员和工人同志们组织成许多突击队，那里有困难就到那里去，不完成任务就不下火线。我们用集体智慧集体力量去攻打堡垒。由于每人都投入到战斗中并深入到工作里去，所以能够发现工作中问题所在；我们技术水平虽然不高，但由于比较深入了实际，能够发现问题，发现了问题大家集思广义。工人在科学研究中也能发挥作用，因为在他所接触的实际工作中，可以根据所掌握的流程、设备提出改进意见。总的说来，这方面的中心问题是大家发现问题，集中起来进行研究，分工负责分头去解决。
    我们青年人干劲是大的，一般的积极性都很高，愿意很快的把工作干好；但我们的技术水平不高，经验也少，这样就容易在工作中发生片面性。这时和我们在一起工作的年长的技术人员给我们一些提示，并和我们一起把工作做好。这是因为他们有较多的实际经验，有较高的科学技术水平。我感到年青的技术人员与年长的技术人员所以能很好的共同进行科学研究工作，不只在于我们青年人可以向年长的技术人员学习，更重要的是我们大家有共同的理想，为完成党所交给的任务而奋斗。我完全同意周总理在报告中所指示的年青的知识分子要虚心地向有学问的前辈学习，一切爱国的知识分子都应当在社会主义的旗帜下面团结起来，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。
    我们年岁还很轻，党的事业有伟大的前途。我们去年的工作还只是刚刚开始，根据去年的工作经验，深深感到必须坚持走又红又专的道路。我们一定按照周总理报告中所指示的，不骄傲自满，经常进行自我改造，在努力提高自己业务水平的同时，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，参加群众的生产和斗争的实践，参加体力劳动，在政治思想上和在工作中严格地要求自己，虚心地向有学问的前辈学习，永远按照党和毛主席指引的方向前进！
    最后，对周总理报告中讲到的西藏问题，也表示衷心的拥护，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱的彻底失败，是西藏人民的胜利，是全国各族人民的胜利。任何想利用西藏反动分子叛乱来达到不可告人的目的的阴谋，都注定是要失败的。中国各族人民一定会更加紧密团结，在党和毛主席的领导下共同进入伟大的社会主义和共产主义社会！
    祝大会胜利成功！祝各位委员健康！
