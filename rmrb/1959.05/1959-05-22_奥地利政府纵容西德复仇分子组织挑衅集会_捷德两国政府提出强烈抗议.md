Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 20th: The Czechoslovak government today, in another note to the Austrian government regarding the so-called "Sudeten German Day" held in Vienna, expressed its regret over Austria's participation in this provocative activity organized by West German revanchist elements.

    The note pointed out that the Austrian government's active participation in this provocative activity indicates its approval of the political aims of West German revanchist elements. The Austrian government must bear full responsibility for the consequences arising from this attitude.

    The so-called "Sudeten German Day," organized by West German revanchist elements, was held in Vienna, the Austrian capital, on May 16th and 17th. The purpose of organizing this provocative activity was to oppose Czechoslovakia and the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. To this end, the Czechoslovak government had already sent a note to the Austrian government on April 16th, protesting against this provocative activity being prepared in Austria.

    The Czechoslovak government's note of May 20th pointed out that one of the aims of organizing "Sudeten German Day" is to exacerbate the tension in Europe, thereby threatening the smooth progress of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. Organizing this provocative activity in Austria is a gross violation of the Austrian State Treaty and contradicts Austria's neutrality.

    Newspapers here also published commentaries today on "Sudeten German Day." The editorial in "Rude Pravo" said that the "Sudeten German Day" held in Vienna has become a demonstration attempting to change the current map of Europe according to the borders of 1939, and a subversive activity by the Bonn government aimed at opposing the relaxation of tension in Europe and opposing the security of Germany's neighbors.

    The commentary in "People's Defence Daily" emphasized that the purpose of organizing this provocative activity of "Sudeten German Day" clearly shows that Czechoslovakia and Poland should be represented at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 21st: The Press Office of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement saying that the government of the German Democratic Republic strongly protested the Austrian government's support for West German militarists and revanchists in organizing the so-called "Sudeten German Congress" (i.e., "Sudeten German Day") in Austria.

    The statement pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the so-called "Sudeten German Congress" held in Vienna is openly directed against Germany's neighbors. One of its aims is to undermine the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and to hinder any attempt to ease tension in Europe. This "congress" held in Vienna is a threat to European peace and is against the interests of peace-loving Germans.

    The statement pointed out that the Austrian government's permission and encouragement for holding this meeting in Vienna, as well as the participation of Austrian Chancellor Raab and Interior Minister Helmer in this congress, not only provides assistance to West German militarists, but also violates the neutrality guaranteed in the Austrian State Treaty.

    奥地利政府纵容西德复仇分子组织挑衅集会
    捷德两国政府提出强烈抗议
    新华社布拉格20日电　捷克斯洛伐克政府20日就在维也纳举行的所谓“苏台德区德国人日”一事再次照会奥地利政府，对它参与西德复仇主义分子组织的这次挑衅活动表示遗憾。
    照会指出，奥地利政府积极参加了这次挑衅活动表明，它赞成西德复仇主义分子的政治目的。奥地利政府应对它的这一态度所引起的后果负完全责任。
    西德复仇主义分子组织的所谓“苏台德区德国人日”，于5月16日和17日在奥地利首都维也纳举行。组织这次挑衅活动的目的是为了反对捷克斯洛伐克和反对日内瓦外长会议。为此，捷克斯洛伐克政府曾经于4月16日照会奥地利政府，对准备在奥地利进行的这次挑衅活动提出了抗议。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府20日的照会指出，组织“苏台德区德国人日”的目的之一是要加剧欧洲的紧张局势，从而威胁日内瓦外长会议的顺利进展。在奥地利组织这一挑衅活动是对奥地利国家条约的粗暴破坏，而且是同奥地利的中立相矛盾的。
    此间报纸今天还就“苏台德区德国人日”发表了评论。“红色权利报”的社论说，在维也纳举行的“苏台德区德国人日”已经成为企图根据1939年的边境改变目前欧洲地图的示威，成为波恩政府旨在反对缓和欧洲紧张局势和反对德国邻国安全的颠覆活动的一部分。
    “人民防线报”的评论强调指出，组织“苏台德区德国人日”这一挑衅活动的目的正好表明，捷克斯洛伐克和波兰应该有代表参加日内瓦外长会议。
    新华社柏林21日电　德意志民主共和国总理新闻处发表声明说，德意志民主共和国政府强烈抗议奥地利政府对西德军国主义分子和复仇主义分子在奥地利组织所谓“苏台德区德国人大会”（即“苏台德区德国人日”）的支持。
    声明指出，德意志民主共和国政府认为，在维也纳举行的所谓“苏台德区德国人大会”是公开对着德国的邻国的。其目的之一是为了破坏日内瓦外长会议以及阻挠任何想缓和欧洲紧张局势的尝试。在维也纳举行的这一“大会”是对欧洲和平的威胁，是违反爱好和平的德国人的利益的。
    声明指出，奥地利政府容许和鼓励在维也纳举行这次会议以及奥地利总理拉布和内政部长赫尔麦的参加这次大会，不仅是对西德军国主义者的帮助，而且破坏了奥地利国家条约中所保证的中立。
