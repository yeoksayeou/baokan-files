We fully agree with the Government Work Report presented by Premier Zhou Enlai, the reports "Draft National Economic Plan for 1959" and "Draft State Final Accounts for 1958 and State Budget for 1959" presented by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by Vice Chairman Li Weihan. These reports comprehensively reflect the unprecedented vigorous development and the magnificent picture of rapid advancement in our country, which has greatly inspired us.

We firmly support the government's consistent and correct policy towards Tibet. The rapid suppression of the armed rebellion instigated by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique in collusion with imperialist aggressors and foreign reactionaries is in accordance with the wishes of the Tibetan people and the common interests of the people of all nationalities. The so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama," which reverses black and white and is full of lies, aroused our great anger. Between the lines, we can clearly smell the stench of a despicable conspiracy. This is not unfamiliar to the long-tested Chinese people. In the face of our unprecedentedly strong and united 600 million people, all traitors of the motherland are bound to meet a shameful end. At the same time, we must also warn certain ill-intentioned people: any conspiracy to split our country and interfere in our internal affairs will be ruthlessly crushed!

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's literary and artistic line, our film industry has achieved great development and brilliant victories in the past ten years. In 1958, inspired and driven by the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, film workers were even more high-spirited and determined to go all out, truly implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical in film production. They brought into play the enthusiasm of all departments of film, this comprehensive art, broke many long-standing conventions in film studios since the beginning of Chinese cinema, and tapped potential, used their brains, found tricks, and carried out various innovations in the production process and technical operations. This has greatly accelerated our film production speed, greatly increased the quantity, and thus greatly reduced the cost. Because of the emphasis on politics in creative thinking, the quality has also improved. The fact that not a single film with erroneous ideological tendencies was produced last year specifically illustrates this point.

Among the experiences gained last year, two points are particularly worth mentioning.

First, the gains from implementing the mass line in film creation. Film is a comprehensive art, requiring the close cooperation of all creative departments. However, in the past, some directors and writers were only accustomed to pondering behind closed doors, not accustomed to bringing into play the wisdom and enthusiasm of the entire production crew, and even not accustomed to listening to the opinions of co-creators. Last year's experience proved that the mass line can and should be followed in film production. Mobilizing the creative staff of each department of the production crew to jointly study and discuss and put forward creative opinions not only reduces the aimlessness or pointless disputes on the spot, which can improve the speed of filming, but also, under the common goal of highlighting the theme of the work, with the director's centralized leadership and democratic discussion, can achieve the effect of mutual inspiration, mutual supplementation, and mutual correction, thereby greatly enriching the content of the work and improving its quality.

The second is the production of documentary art films. This new style of film arose from the urgent need to quickly reflect the face of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland. The production of such films enabled our creative staff to come into contact with the reality of today's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and to receive the leadership of local Party committees or enterprise Party committees and the warm help of workers and peasants, initially experiencing the benefits of the "three combinations" [of leaders, experts, and masses]. All these benefits are not only directly and clearly reflected in specific works, but also have far-reaching significance for our future creations, to say the least.

On the basis of the leap forward in 1958, our film creators are preparing to continue to go all out, to better complete the film production tasks for 1959, and to produce more and better films to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

We realize that to make the film industry flourish and develop, we must earnestly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" on the basis of serving socialism, and advocate different styles of film creation. At the same time, we deeply realize that truly opening up fragrant flowers with relatively high ideological and artistic quality cannot be achieved without hard work. The quality of the film inevitably depends on the level of the creative staff in terms of ideology, life, and professional skills. We must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's works, in order to improve our ideological and theoretical level, and we must also conscientiously study our profession and become truly proficient in film business. What we feel more urgent at present is to go deep into life and transform ourselves through labor training. Our ideal is to have a period of time every year or every two years, after completing certain production tasks, to go to factories and the countryside in turn, and gradually become familiar with their thoughts and feelings by living and working with workers and peasants, thereby transforming ourselves. We believe that only in this way can our works be truly improved and undergo fundamental changes in quality. If the main creative staff are only busy coping with production tasks, and do not have time to sum up their creative experiences and lessons, and do not have enough opportunities to go deep into life and engage in labor training, then over time, the tendency to be divorced from life and divorced from reality will inevitably become more serious. Therefore, when considering the quantity of production, the time for the creative staff to live and train should be included in the plan.

To improve the quality of films, especially to look forward and see the future development of the film industry, it is not enough to rely solely on the improvement of the existing staff. To adapt to the development of our country's industry and agriculture and the cultural needs of the people, our film production will always increase day by day. Therefore, we must quickly expand our ranks and train new forces. We have not done enough in this regard in the past. As far as the current situation is concerned, we are already deeply aware of the shortage of manpower. The above-mentioned situation of being too busy with production to go deep into life is also partly due to the lack of reserve forces. We do have a sense of "no successors." Taking the Shanghai Film Studio and Tianma Film Studio as examples, the average age of our actors is already close to forty! Even if a few actors with special talents can play young roles "big or small," we cannot but see the problem in a few years; and it takes several years to train an actor. Now, we plan to train new film creators through running schools and cultivating reserve forces in the amateur drama groups of various enterprises and people's communes. This will inevitably require strong support and understanding from all parties. We ask that talented young people be selected from industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, and schools at all levels to enrich the film team, and we also ask to be allowed to maintain special contact with amateur drama activists in various enterprises and communes, and finally draw out the most talented to become professional film workers through the steps of participating in film work part-time and semi-professionally. In order to meet the cultural needs of 600 million people, and to have film works that can match our country's political status internationally, we must enrich the film creation team with the most talented people, which is very easy to understand.

Of course, improving film quality also requires the support and cooperation of all aspects of literature and art. Film is a comprehensive art, and it is difficult to imagine that it can improve independently without the progress and development of literature, drama, fine arts, music, and so on. Taking the inheritance of national traditions as an example, film must inherit the national traditions of literature, the national traditions of fine arts, the national traditions of music, and finally, the national traditions of performance. It is difficult to rely on a few film workers to do this alone. Conversely, writers, artists, musicians, and performing artists can often use film practice to exert their roles and blaze new trails. Because film has a large audience and is the most mass-based art. Nie Er's development of his musical combat role and the opening up of a new path of music due to writing film music is a well-known example. Specialization is necessary; however, should we promote greater and better cooperative relations between various literary and art departments? We believe it is necessary.

Here, we would like to specifically raise the issue of cooperation between film and drama. Over the past many years, film has continuously received support from drama, and many stage directors and actors have participated in film work. Many film directors and actors have also participated in stage performances. However, we believe that we should explore more possibilities to enable film and drama groups in various places to truly exchange what they have and form a unified whole. We believe that this will not only improve the quality of films, but also promote the prosperity of the drama industry.

We are all film workers from Shanghai and can only speak based on the situation in Shanghai's film production. Please correct us if the opinions mentioned above are incorrect.

　　提高电影质量需要各方面的协作
    白杨、赵丹、黄佐临、沈浮、陈鲤庭、郑君里、秦怡、张瑞芳、张骏祥、柯灵委员的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理提出的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理提出的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案”和“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案”的报告，彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，以及李维汉副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。这些报告全面地反映了我国史无前例的蓬勃发展情况和飞跃前进中的宏伟图景，使我们受到了极大的鼓舞。
    我们坚决拥护政府对西藏地方所采取的一贯的正确方针。西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义侵略者、外国反动派所策动的武装叛乱迅速平定，是符合西藏人民的愿望的，也是符合民族人民的共同利益的。颠倒黑白、满纸谎话的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，引起我们极大的愤怒。我们从字里行间，可以分明地嗅出卑鄙的阴谋的气味。对久经考验的中国人民来说，这并不是生疏的。在我们空前强大和空前团结一致的六亿人民面前，一切祖国的叛徒，必然要得到可耻的失败的下场。同时我们也要正告某些心怀不善的人们：任何企图分裂我们国家，干涉我国内政的阴谋诡计，都将被无情地粉碎！
    我们的电影事业，在毛泽东思想和党的文艺方针的指引之下，十年来取得了巨大的发展和光辉的胜利。一九五八年，在全国工农业一日千里的大跃进的鼓舞和推动之下，电影工作者更是意气风发、斗志昂扬地鼓足了干劲，真正地在电影生产中贯彻了多、快、好、省的方针，在创作上发挥了电影这个综合艺术的各部门的积极性，打破了多少从中国有电影以来一直打不破的摄影场里的陈规，在生产过程和技术操作上，发掘了潜力，动了脑筋，找了窍门，进行了各种各样的革新。这样，就使我们的电影生产速度大大地加快了，数量大大地增加了，因之成本也大大地降低了。而由于创作思想上政治挂了帅，在质量上也有了提高，有不少影片是成绩优异深受观众欢迎的，去年没有拍出一部有错误思想倾向的影片，更是具体的说明了这一点。
    在去年所获得的经验中，有两点是特别值得提出的。
    一是在电影创作中贯彻群众路线的收获。电影是综合艺术，需要各个创作部门的通力协作。但是过去总有些编导，只习惯于个人闭门苦思，不习惯于发挥全摄制组创作人员的智慧和积极性，甚至不习惯于倾听共同创作人员的意见。去年的经验证明：在电影生产中同样可以而且应该走群众路线。发动摄制组各部门创作人员共同研究讨论，提出创作上的见解，不仅减少临场时的盲无头绪或无谓争执，可以提高摄制进度；而且在突出作品的主题思想的共同目的之下，由导演集中领导，民主讨论，更可以收到互相启发、互相补充、互相纠正的效果，从而大大地丰富作品的内容，提高作品的质量。
    其次是纪录性艺术片的摄制。这种新的电影样式产生于迅速反映祖国大跃进面貌的迫切要求。这种影片的摄制，使我们的创作人员能够接触到今天工农业大跃进的实际，又能够得到当地党委或企业党委的领导和工人农民群众的亲切的帮助，初步体会到了三结合的好处。这一切好处不但直接地在具体作品上显而易见地反映了出来，对于我们今后的创作，不用说，更有着深远的意义。
    在一九五八年的跃进的基础上，我们电影创作人员，正准备继续鼓足干劲，来更好地完成一九五九年的电影生产任务，拍出又多又好的影片，来向祖国国庆十周年献礼。
    我们认识到：要使电影事业繁荣发展就必须认真贯彻在为社会主义服务的基础上“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，提倡不同样式不同风格的电影创作。同时我们又深切地体会到：要真正开放出思想性艺术性比较高的香花，不经过艰苦的努力，是做不到的。影片的质量，不能不决定于创作人员的思想、生活、业务三方面的水平。我们必须努力学习马列主义，特别是毛主席的著作，以求提高自己的思想理论水平，也必须认真钻研业务，做真正精通电影业务的人。而目前我们感觉得更迫切的，则是深入生活，通过劳动锻炼，改造自己的问题。我们的理想是每年或每两年在完成一定生产任务之后，能有一段时间，轮番到工厂去到农村去，通过与工人农民一起生活一起劳动，逐步熟悉他们的思想感情，从而改造自己。我们认为只有这样，才能使我们的作品真正得到提高，在质量上起根本的变化。如果主要的创作人员只忙于应付生产任务，没有时间总结自己的创作中的经验和教训，没有足够的机会深入生活从事劳动锻炼。日子长了，就必然会更加重脱离生活脱离实际的倾向。因此，在考虑生产数量的时候，就应该把创作人员的生活锻炼的时间规划在内。
    为了提高影片质量，特别是向前看，看到今后电影事业的发展，单靠原有人员的提高也还是不够的。要同我国工农业的发展，人民的文化需要相适应，我们的影片生产量总是日益提高的。因此，我们就必须迅速扩大我们的队伍，培养新生力量。这一点我们过去也还是做得不够的。就目前而论，我们也已经深切地感到人手的不足。上面所说的只忙于生产不能深入生活，也多少是由于没有后备力量所致。我们的确有些“后继无人”之感。以上海的海燕和天马两个故事片厂来说，我们的演员的平均年龄已经近四十岁了！即使少数有特殊才能的演员，能够“小大由之”地扮演年青角色，我们也不能不看到若干年后的问题；而培养一个演员是需要几年工夫的。现在，我们打算通过办学校和在各企业单位各人民公社的业余戏剧团体中培植后备力量这两种方法，来培养电影创作的新兵。这就不得不要求各方面的大力支持和谅解。我们要求能在工矿企业、人民公社和各级学校中，选拔有才华的青年来充实电影的队伍，更要求允许我们和各企业、公社里业余的戏剧活动分子保持特殊联系，通过业余、半业余地参加电影工作的步骤，最后抽调最有才华的出来成为专业的电影工作者。为了满足六亿人民的文化需要，为了在国际上有能和我国的政治地位相称的电影作品，我们必须以最有才华的人来充实电影的创作队伍，这一点是极易了解的。
    当然，提高电影质量，还需要文学艺术各个方面的支持和协作。电影是个综合艺术，很难设想它能够离开文学、戏剧、美术、音乐等等方面的进步和发展而单独提高。就以继承民族传统而言，电影既要继承文学的民族传统，又要继承美术的民族传统，又要继承音乐的民族传统，最后，还要继承表演上的民族传统。这是很难依靠少数电影工作者来单独做到的。反过来说，文学家美术家音乐家表演艺术家又常常可以通过电影实践来发挥他们的作用，闯出新的道路。因为电影拥有极大的观众，是群众性最大的艺术。聂耳由于写电影音乐而发挥了他的音乐的战斗作用，打开了新音乐的道路，这个例子是谁都知道的。专业化是必要的；但是，是否应该在各文艺部门之间发扬更大更好的协作关系呢？我们认为是有必要的。
    这里，我们想特别提出电影和话剧的协作问题。过去多少年来，电影曾不断地得到话剧方面的支援，很多舞台上的导演演员参加了电影工作。也有不少的电影导演演员参加了舞台剧的演出。但是，我们认为还应该挖掘更多的可能，使各地电影话剧团体，真正做到互通有无，打成一片。我们相信这样不但可以使电影的质量得到提高，也可以促进话剧事业的繁荣。
    我们都是来自上海的电影工作者，只能根据上海电影生产中的情况发言。上面所谈到的意见是否正确，还请各位代表各位委员指正。
