Guo Moruo's new work, the five-act historical drama "Cai Wenji," has premiered in the capital by the Beijing People's Art Theater. The play depicts the joys and sorrows of Cai Wenji, a talented female writer from the Han Dynasty (author of "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute"). The play focuses on her experiences during the turmoil at the end of the Han Dynasty—her exile among the Xiongnu, and her subsequent redemption by Cao Cao, the Han Chancellor. During this period, she wrote the soul-stirring "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute," lamenting her own fate. The play possesses profound emotional power in depicting her tragic feelings. Zhu Lin, who plays Cai Wenji, through the process of Cai Wenji composing "Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute," as well as her righteous actions of seeking an audience with Cao Cao after returning to the Han to defend the unjustly accused Dong Si, relatively perfectly shapes the image of this female poet. In addition, the entire performance has made new attempts in learning from the traditions of opera. The creation of the stage image and the coordination of the music are also excellent. Recently, the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles invited cultural and artistic circles in the capital to discuss the drama "Cai Wenji." Everyone believes that the performance of "Cai Wenji" is very exciting, but some comrades also believe that the reasons for Wenji's return to the Han Dynasty are not sufficiently substantiated in the play.

    郭沫若的新作“蔡文姬”
    郭沫若同志的新作、五幕历史剧“蔡文姬”，已由北京人民艺术剧院在首都公演。剧的内容是描写汉代一个有才华的女文学家（“胡笳十八拍”的作者）蔡文姬的悲欢离合的故事。剧中着重描写了她在汉末战乱中的遭遇——她流落匈奴，后来又被汉丞相曹操赎回。在这个期间，她写出了震撼人心的“胡笳十八拍”，哀痛自己的身世。剧本在描写她的悲剧感情上，有着深刻的感人力量。扮演蔡文姬的朱琳，通过蔡文姬所作“胡笳十八拍”的经过，以及她归汉后求见曹操维护被陷害的董祀的正义行动，比较完美地塑造了这个女诗人的形象。此外，整个演出，在向戏曲传统 学习上作了新的尝试。舞台形象的创造，和音乐的配合，也都是优美的。最近中国戏剧家协会和北京市文联邀请首都文艺界座谈话剧“蔡文姬”，大家认为“蔡文姬”的演出，非常激动人心，但也有些同志认为，剧本写文姬归汉的理由还不够充分。　（黎西）
