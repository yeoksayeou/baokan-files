I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the various reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

After listening to Premier Zhou's report, I felt extremely inspired and encouraged. This report is an epic summary of China's Great Leap Forward in 1958, and also a clarion call to inspire a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. I deeply understand that Premier Zhou's report is full of the spirit of unity, construction, and peace. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country will certainly be able to correctly implement this spirit, unite as one, work hard, work practically, work cleverly, and fight heroically to victoriously complete and overfulfill the tasks set in the magnificent 1959 national economic plan.

Now, I will make a speech on the issue of the remolding of industrialists and businessmen.

Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that industrialists and businessmen should continue to conduct self-education and self-remolding in the work of participating in socialist construction. Vice Chairman Li Weihan also put forward actively promoting and assisting democratic figures from all walks of life to carry out self-remolding as an important aspect of the CPPCC's work in his report on the CPPCC's work. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, we industrialists and businessmen have made considerable progress in self-remolding and in participating in socialist construction; however, if we compare the current political and ideological situation of most of us with the broad masses of working people, and then measure it against the six political criteria, we can clearly see that the issue of the two roads of capitalism and socialism has not been resolved, and the political stance must continue to be fundamentally transformed. In the past, the Party and the government have consistently educated us to accept socialist transformation, encouraged our slightest progress, and continuously pointed out our class nature and ideas and behaviors that are not conducive to socialism, helping us to recognize and correct them. This time, Premier Zhou once again pointed out the path of self-remolding for us, and I deeply feel the Party and government's heartfelt concern and warmth for us.

Chairman Mao once taught us, "The thorough remolding of industrialists and businessmen must be carried out in the course of work. They should labor together with the workers in the enterprise and take the enterprise as a base for self-remolding. However, it is also important to change some of their old views through study." Chairman Mao's instruction and Premier Zhou's instruction this time are both what we must follow in carrying out self-remolding. Let me focus here on my personal fragmentary experiences and superficial understanding of the path of remolding "with the enterprise or work post as the base."

I am a private sector employee of the Tianjin Joint Public-Private Renli Woolen Textile Factory. Although I have done very little work in the enterprise in the past few years, being in a lively and vigorous production unit and coming into contact with constantly emerging new things has given me a profound education.

First of all, the leap-forward development of the enterprise after the joint venture made me realize the truth that the relations of production must adapt to the development of the productive forces. When our factory was changed to a joint public-private enterprise in December 1954, there were only 653 employees, and the annual total output value was only 6 million yuan, with small output, poor quality, high consumption, high cost, and low labor productivity. And now? In just four years after the joint venture, the number of employees has increased to 2,120. The total output value in 1958 has exceeded 35 million yuan (this year's total output value target will increase by 50 percent compared with last year), the enthusiasm of the employees is soaring, the output and quality have greatly improved, the labor productivity has greatly increased, and the consumption and costs have been greatly reduced. The quality of the roasted flower overcoat produced has surpassed that of the British, who are old brands of wool fabric production. The production task for 1958 was completed 15 days ahead of schedule. Afterwards, our factory won the glorious title of municipal model factory.

Regarding such amazing changes, I wondered how exactly it was changed? It was the same factory before, and after the joint venture, some machines were added, but not many; although the number of employees has increased by more than two times, the output value has increased five-fold; the cost has been reduced, and the multiple of output increase is even more than five times. After analysis, I realized that after the enterprise joint venture, the relations of production changed, exploitation was basically eliminated, the workers became the masters, and the productive forces greatly developed. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system and the unparalleled correctness of the Party's leadership.

The superiority of the socialist system is also reflected in the business management of the enterprise. After the joint venture, the production management and technical management have been thoroughly reformed. Last year, through the "two participations, one change, and three combinations" and the "double anti" movement, many rules and regulations have been further improved. For example, the financial accounting work was originally handled by 17 cadres, but after last year's reform, the ledgers, reports, and procedures have been greatly simplified. Now, although this department's work is only done by four people, the monthly closing and reporting are completed better and faster than in the past. I used to specialize in accounting and statistics, and I have also managed private enterprises for more than 30 years. Why couldn't I think of such a simplified financial system? The reason is that what I learned and did were all the old sets of capitalism, and until now I have not been able to discard or transform these things. At the same time, I also realized that the wisdom of the masses is infinite, and I must learn from the workers and continue to strengthen self-remolding so that I can make useful contributions in the work of participating in socialist construction.

Also, the close and selfless cooperation between factories often reflects the superiority of the socialist system. For several months, our factory has cultivated and trained more than 700 workers for the newly built wool factories in Qinghai and Inner Mongolia. Regardless of any inventions and technical innovations, they are always exchanged with each other, and professional meetings and on-site meetings are often held to discuss, study, and solve various problems in production technology and management. At the same time, competitions are also launched to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and surpass each other in order to make progress together. I deeply feel that such cooperation can only be realized in a socialist society.

What gives me the greatest feeling and the most profound education is the revolutionary enthusiasm and soaring drive of the workers. After the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, through the "two participations, one change, and three combinations," our factory, under the leadership of the Party and the public factory director, set off a wave of production competition, and many moving deeds emerged. In the industrial wool plug workshop, because the quota was too low, the wages earned by workers on a piece-rate basis could exceed 50 percent of the graded wage each month. In the Great Blooming and Great Contending, the workers disregarded personal interests and voluntarily requested to change this unreasonable regulation. Since the change from piece-rate to time-rate wages, the workers have become even more motivated. Soon, the daily output jumped from 72,000 heads in the past to about 100,000 heads, and it even reached more than 140,000 heads when launching satellites. One day, the factory's largest boiler suddenly malfunctioned, and repairs required a shutdown for more than 30 hours. The worker Zhang Xiyuan braved the high temperature and drilled into the 100-degree furnace to inspect and repair it. Although his hair was scorched, he insisted on rushing to repair it. Under his leadership, the repair task was completed 12 hours ahead of schedule. Compared with the bourgeois self-interested nature, such a selfless spirit for socialism is a clear contrast. Looking back on myself, I can't help but feel ashamed. The electrician Han Changhe has been studying for a long time and created a low water level alarm automatic water supply device for boilers. The worker Yang Zhi used a combination of foreign and local methods to make a ten-foot-long gantry planer. These examples not only made me realize once again that the masses are an inexhaustible source of wisdom, but also the workers' spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties gave me a lot of emotion and inspiration. Let me give another example. Two or three months ago, our factory held an exhibition of the factory's history of the workers' movement, using many pictures and explanations to describe an epic of nearly 30 years of struggle. Before the exhibition, the public factory director said to me that many of the exhibited events were related to me. In the private period, I have always been the person in charge of the factory, so I did not think it was strange when I heard it. I followed and said, "Now I should hate the old self who did bad things before." Although the words were good, when I entered the exhibition site and saw this and that picture and explanation, I felt a little resistant in my heart, secretly thinking of some objective reasons at the time to forgive myself, fully illustrating that I am still maintaining the old and decadent things. I have a bit of vague or completely forgotten about many things that persecuted the workers, but I clearly remember the incident that workers surrounded me by closing the factory gate to demand a year-end bonus before liberation, and I have not forgotten who closed the door. This shows that I originally did not care about things that harmed others, but I was concerned about things that harmed me. If such a nature is not transformed, can it still work?

Let's talk about the education given to me by the workers in our factory learning philosophy. The workers' learning of philosophy began by closely integrating learning with production. First start from the actual situation, raise to the level of theoretical principles to analyze and understand, and then return to the actual situation to promote production. For example, in the production battle, there was a disconnection between workshops or between work sections, and this situation was analyzed in terms of theoretical principles, so that they realized that "balance is a temporary phenomenon, and imbalance is a normal phenomenon," and "unfavorable factors can be transformed into favorable factors under certain conditions." Understanding these, and then returning to reality, they fully exerted their subjective initiative to break through the weak links in production. Therefore, through learning philosophy, the employees can specifically understand the dialectical relationship between "subjective and objective," "balance and imbalance," "contradiction and development," and "hard work and clever work" from their actual work. However, many people, including myself, once thought that it was difficult or strange for workers to learn philosophy; subjectively thinking that they are more educated and still not easy to understand the theory of Marxism-Leninism, let alone workers with lower education? A worker said well: "Philosophy is to serve production and the working class. It is our workers' weapon of struggle. Although your culture is now higher than ours, you do not participate in production labor and your ass is sitting on the side of the bourgeoisie, how can you understand our philosophy?" This is a one-shot deal for me, because I only consider culture in the philosophy learning issue, and did not consider the class nature. I sincerely want to learn from the working class and from the workers in our factory.

Our factory is continuing to launch a vigorous campaign to make contributions to socialist construction and a red flag competition. Under the leadership of the Party and the public, and with the encouragement and promotion of the worker comrades, the private sector personnel have also invested in the movement, beating gongs and drums to put forward specific guarantees to the enterprise Party committee, determined to strengthen the transformation and ensure that they make specific contributions. For example, in February this year, our private sector personnel successfully trial-produced a small centrifugal spindle spinning machine, successfully tested shock dyeing, and formulated a set of methods and systems for managing yarn frames and yarn tubes. In addition, the work of the salespersons in the small department store in the factory is taken over by us in shifts every Sunday, which also enables us to have more opportunities to contact the worker comrades and shorten the distance between us. It must be pointed out that our existing achievements are insignificant compared with the employees. We must continue to redouble our efforts and make greater achievements.

Fellow members, we industrialists and businessmen must recognize that we still need to strengthen our transformation. The main way to transform is to immerse ourselves in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in the enterprise or work post, actively contribute all our talents and strength, and continue to conduct self-education and self-remolding in the work of participating in socialist construction. The moving deeds of the employees are living forces that drive us to constantly move forward towards socialism. We must closely rely on the Party, faithfully accept the leadership of the public, take the transformation of political thought as the commander, strive to learn the spirit of the employees' hard work, overcoming difficulties, selfless labor, and love for the factory as their home, give full play to our subjective initiative, and closely combine transformation with service, and take practical actions to support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and work with the people of the whole country to realize China's magnificent 1959 Great Leap Forward plan.

Finally, I firmly support all the measures taken by the State Council to maintain the unity of the motherland and national unity in response to the rebellion in Tibet, and firmly demand that the Tibetan rebels who betrayed the motherland be severely punished. I express my utmost indignation at the conspiracies of the imperialists and foreign reactionaries against Tibet. The 650 million Chinese people who have stood up will never allow any foreign interference in our internal affairs. No foreign reactionary force can split Tibet from China, nor can it prevent the Tibetan people from advancing along the bright road of socialism and building the Tibetan Plateau into a democratic, free, prosperous, and happy paradise on earth.

　　认清资产阶级本质  彻底进行自我改造
    朱继圣委员谈自己在天津市公私合营仁立毛呢纺织厂职工推动下进行自我改造的体会
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的各项报告。
    听了周总理的报告，使我感到万分振奋和鼓舞。这个报告是总结我国一九五八年大跃进的史诗，也是鼓舞一九五九年更大、更好、更全面的跃进的号角。我深深体会到周总理的报告充满着团结、建设、和平的精神。全国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，一定能够正确地贯彻这个精神，团结一致，苦干、实干、巧干，为胜利地完成和超额完成宏伟的一九五九年国民经济计划所提出的任务而英勇奋斗。
    现在，我就工商业者的改造问题作一次发言。
    周总理在报告中指出工商业者要在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。李维汉副主席也在政协工作报告中把积极推动和协助各界民主人士进行自我改造提出作为政协工作的一个重要方面。这几年来，我们工商业者，在党的领导下，通过反右派斗争和整风运动，虽然在自我改造方面以及在参加社会主义建设方面，有了不少的进展；但是，如果把我们多数人的当前的政治、思想情况和广大劳动人民来比较，再以六项政治标准来衡量，可以明显地看出，资本主义和社会主义两条道路的问题并没有解决，政治立场还必须继续加强根本改造。党和政府在过去一贯教育我们必须接受社会主义改造，对我们点滴的进步都加以鼓励，对我们的阶级本质和不利于社会主义的思想、行为不断地给我们指出，帮助我们认识和改正。这次周总理又一次给我们指出，自我改造的途径，我深深感到党和政府对我们的亲切关怀和温暖。
    毛主席曾经教导我们，“工商业者的彻底改造必须是在工作中间，他们应当在企业内同职工一起劳动，把企业作为自我改造的基地。但是经过学习改变自己的某些旧观点，也是重要的。”毛主席这个指示和这次周总理的指示都是我们在进行自我改造中所必须遵循的。让我在这里着重地对“以企业或工作岗位为基地”的改造途径谈一谈我个人的片断经验和粗浅体会。
    我是天津市公私合营仁立毛呢纺织厂的一个私方人员。这几年来，我虽然在企业里工作做得很少，但是在一个生产单位的轰轰烈烈、生动活泼的场合里，和不断出现的新鲜事物相接触就使我受到深刻的教育。
    首先，企业在合营以后的飞跃发展，使我体会到生产关系必须适应生产力的发展的真理。当我们厂在一九五四年十二月改为公私合营的时候，职工只六百五十三人，年总产值不过六百万元，产量小、质量次、消耗大、成本高、劳动生产率低。而现在呢？合营仅仅四年，职工已经增加到二千一百二十人。一九五八年的总产值已经超过三千五百万元（今年总产值指标还要比去年增加百分之五十），职工的干劲、热火朝天，产量、质量、劳动生产率都大大提高了，消耗和成本都大大降低了。出品烤花大衣呢的质量已经超过了老牌出产呢绒的英国。一九五八年的生产任务提前十五天完成了。以后，我们厂获得了市级模范厂的光荣称号。
    对这样惊人的变化，我就想这究竟是怎样变过来的呢？从前也是这个厂，合营后，机器添了一些，但是不多；职工虽然增加了两倍多，可是产值骤增了五倍；成本降低了，产量增加的倍数就还要比五倍为多。经过分析，我认识到企业合营以后，生产关系改变了，剥削基本消灭了，工人当家作主了，生产力所以大大发展了。这充分说明社会主义制度的优越性和党的领导的无比正确。
    社会主义制度的优越性还反映到企业的经营管理方面。合营以后，生产管理和技术管理都进行了彻底改革。去年又通过“两参一改三结合”，和“双反”运动，好些规章制度进一步得到了改进。例如，财务会计工作原来由十七个干部担任，经过去年的改革，账本、表报和手续都大大地简化了。现在，这部门的工作虽然仅仅由四个人来做，可是，月终的结账造表还比过去更好更快地完成。我从前是专修会计学和统计学的，管理私营企业也有了三十多年，为什么我没能想出像那样的简化财会制度呢？原因是，我所学所做的都是资本主义的老一套，而到现在我还没能把这些东西抛弃或者改造过来。同时，我还认识到群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，我必须向职工学习，继续加强自我改造，使在参加社会主义建设的工作中能够作出有益的贡献。
    还有，厂与厂之间经常进行紧密的无私的协作，也体现了社会主义制度的优越性。我们厂，几个月来，为青海、内蒙古新建的毛厂培养训练了七百多个工人。不论有什么创造发明和技术革新，总在互相交流，经常还召开专业会议和现场会议，来讨论、研究、解决生产技术和管理上的种种问题。同时还开展竞赛，互相学、比、赶、超，以求共同前进。我深深感到，这样的协作只有在社会主义社会里才能实现。
    给我最大感受和最深刻教育的是职工们的革命热忱和冲天干劲。反右派斗争和整风运动以后，通过“两参一改三结合”，我们厂在党和公方厂长领导下掀起了生产竞赛的热潮，出现了许许多多动人的事迹。工业用呢插头工段，因为定额太低，工人按计件所得的工资每月可以超过评级工资百分之五十，在大鸣大放中，工人们不计较个人利益自动要求改变这个不合理的规定。自从计件改为计时工资之后，工人的干劲反而更大了，不久，每日产量从过去的七万二千头飞跃到十万头左右，放卫星时候还达到了十四万头以上。有一天，厂里的最大锅炉突然发生故障，进行修理须停炉三十多小时，工人张喜元冒着高温钻进一百多度的炉膛里去检修，虽然头发都被烤焦仍坚持抢修，在他的带动下，修理任务提前十二小时完成了。这样一切为社会主义的忘我精神和资产阶级自私自利的本质相比，正是显明的对照。反躬自问，不禁惭愧万分。电工韩长和长期钻研，创造了锅炉低水位报警自动上水器，工人杨志用洋土结合的办法制作了一台丈二的龙门刨。这些事例不仅使我又一次认识到群众是无穷尽的智慧泉源，而且工人们的刻苦钻研和克服困难的精神也给了我很大的感动和启示。让我再举一个例子，两三个月前我们厂举行了一次本厂工运史的展览，用许多画片和说明来描写出将近三十年的斗争的史诗。展出之前，公方厂长对我说，好些展出的事件都和我有关联。在私营时期，我一直是厂的负责人，所以，我听了不以为奇。我跟着说：“现在我应当痛恨以前做过坏事的旧我。”话虽然说得不错，但是当我一进展览场所，看到这个那个的画片和说明，心中就有些抵触，暗地里在想一些当时的客观理由来原谅自己，充分说明我还在维护旧的腐朽东西。对好些迫害工人的事情我都有点模糊或完全忘了，而对远在解放以前工人为了要求年奖关守厂门包围我这件事则记得清清楚楚，连门是谁关的也没有忘掉。这说明我对损人的事原是毫不在意，对我有损的事则切切在心。这样的本质如果不加以改造还能行吗？
    再谈谈我厂工人学哲学的事所给我的教育。工人学哲学开始就是把学习和生产紧密结合起来。先从实际出发，提高到理论原则上来分析认识，再回到实际中来，推动生产。例如，在生产战斗中出现了车间与车间或工段与工段之间的脱节现象，就把这种情况加以理论原则性的分析，使认识到“平衡是暂时的现象，不平衡的是正常的现象”，“不利因素在一定条件下可以转化为有利因素”。懂得了这些，再回到实际中来，充分发挥主观能动性来突破生产上存在的薄弱环节。所以通过学哲学，职工们能够从实际工作中具体地体会到“主观与客观”，“平衡与不平衡”，“矛盾与发展”，“苦干与巧干”的辩证关系。可是，好些人，包括我个人在内，曾经以为工人学哲学是个难事或奇事；主观地想，自己是文化较高的尚且不易学懂马克思列宁主义的理论，何况文化较低的工人呢？一个工人说得好：“哲学是为生产服务、为工人阶级服务的。它是咱们工人的斗争武器。你们的文化虽然现在比咱们高些，但是你们既不参加生产劳动而屁股又坐在资产阶级那一边，怎能学懂咱们的哲学呢？”这对我正是一针见血，因为我对学哲学问题只考虑文化，没有考虑阶级本质，我心悦诚服地要向工人阶级学习，要向本厂工人学习。
    我们厂正在继续开展一个轰轰烈烈的为社会主义建设立功运动和红旗竞赛。私方人员在党和公方的领导和职工同志们的鼓励和推动下也投入到运动当中，敲锣打鼓向企业党委提出具体保证条件，决心加强改造，保证做出具体贡献。例如，在今年二月里，我们私方人员试制一台小型的离心锭纺纱机成功，试验震荡染色成功，制订出一套管理纱筐纱管的办法和制度，另外，还把厂内小百货商店售货员的工作每到星期日都由我们包下来轮流值班来做，同时也使我们能够有更多的机会和职工同志相接触缩短彼此之间的距离。必须指出，我们已有的成就，如和职工们相比，乃是微不足道的。我们还必须继续加倍努力，作出更大的成绩。
    各位委员，我们工商业者必须认识自己还需要加强改造。改造的途径主要是在企业或工作岗位里把自己投入到大跃进的行列中来，积极贡献一切才能和力量，在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。职工们的动人事迹都是活生生的动力推动我们向社会主义不断地前进。我们必须紧密靠拢党，忠诚接受公方的领导，以政治思想改造为统帅，努力学习职工的刻苦钻研、克服困难、忘我劳动、爱厂如家的精神，发挥自己的主观能动性，把改造与服务紧密地结合起来，以实际行动来拥护周总理的政府工作报告，和全国人民一道，为实现我国宏伟的一九五九年大跃进计划而努力。
    最后，我坚决拥护国务院为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，对西藏的叛乱事件所采取的一切措施并坚决要求严厉地惩罚背叛祖国的西藏叛乱分子。对帝国主义者和外国反动派对西藏的阴谋活动，表示万分愤慨。站起来了的六亿五千万中国人民决不允许任何外国干涉我国的内政。任何外国反动力量都不能把西藏从中国分裂出去，都不能阻止西藏人民沿着社会主义光明大道前进，把西藏高原建设成为一个民主自由，繁荣幸福的人间乐园。
