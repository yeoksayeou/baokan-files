Committee member Ding Zuocheng said: In this great era, it is the best opportunity for technical personnel to serve the country. Even if I am only in my sixties, even if I am in my seventies or eighties, I will do my best to fulfill my glorious responsibility for building socialism.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully support Premier Zhou's government work report, the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the report of Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

Vice Premier Li Fuchun instructed in his report: "The 1959 industrial production plan will first focus on the development of raw material industries and fuel and power industries." As a technical personnel, I am particularly excited about this point. Because the quantity and quality of raw materials are the issues that we technical personnel pay most attention to in production on a daily basis. In fact, the issue of raw materials is a key issue in industrial production. Vice Premier Li said in his report: "Only with more raw materials can we manufacture more machines; with more raw materials, fuel, power, and machines, can all industrial sectors and even all sectors of the national economy develop more rapidly." This is completely correct. I believe that with the completion of the 1959 economic construction plan, the tight supply of raw materials in China's industrial production will gradually change. This makes me very excited. However, we should also see that with the development of production, the demand for raw materials will also be greater. In a certain period, the tight supply of raw materials cannot be completely avoided. Therefore, we still need to do everything possible to overcome difficulties and vigorously conserve the use of raw materials.

I am a private technical personnel at the Shanghai Dahua Instrument Factory. In the past, there was a period when I did not fully understand the significance of the Great Leap Forward. I was afraid of being stressed and unable to handle it. I thought that I was already over sixty years old anyway, and I had some savings, so there would be no problem with my livelihood. Therefore, I once had the idea of retiring.

Through the actual education of the Great Leap Forward last year, I saw that the public sector and the masses of workers were really enthusiastic. Every time I called the factory late at night, the public factory director was always there working hard. After the workers got off work, the leaders repeatedly advised them to go back to rest, but they would secretly come back to work after a while. I couldn't help but ask myself, what are they doing all this for? And what am I doing for?

Later, when I went to the workshop and often came into contact with the workers, I also realized their warm feelings and their sincere love for the cause of socialism. My technical suggestions and opinions were very welcomed and valued by them; and many of the problems and opinions they raised were often things that I had not thought of, which gave me a lot of inspiration. From this, I not only realized the wisdom of the working masses, that technical personnel must be combined with the working masses to better play their role; but also made me realize that as a private technical personnel, at a time when the country needs it so much, how can I be at ease if I don't contribute my little technical talent?

In February and March this year, after listening to the reports from the central meetings of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I had a deeper understanding of the Party's "five unchanged" policy, "even more gentle and considerate," and "labor within one's ability," etc. I sincerely felt that the Party's care for us bourgeois elements was truly meticulous. How could we not actively serve socialism? At this time, I analyzed my original retirement thoughts, which were completely based on individualism, and I felt that it was completely wrong.

After listening to the reports from the central leaders this time, I gained a clear understanding of the significance of the Great Leap Forward in our country in 1958. The socialist construction of our country has leapt forward, and the economic face of the entire country has rapidly changed. It is truly unprecedented! How can it not make people feel infinitely excited! Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "The main task of the people of the whole country this year is to actively strive to complete and over fulfill this national economic plan centered on the four major indicators." Therefore, I feel that being in this great era is the best opportunity for us technical personnel to use our expertise to serve the country. Even if I am only in my sixties, even if I am in my seventies or eighties, I will do my best to fulfill my glorious responsibility for building socialism. At the same time, Premier Zhou also pointed out to us: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in the long-term practice of work in the future." I must strive to transform myself in the practice of actively serving socialism.

Our Dahua Instrument Factory's production task this year is to provide automated equipment for the boiler units of large and medium-sized power plants, and at the same time, to provide automated recording electronic instruments for thermal equipment such as smelting, rolling, and coking. Recently, the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Central People's Broadcasting Station held a radio competition conference. Our public factory director proposed in a broadcast at the conference: "The main engine leaves the factory, and the instrument follows," guaranteeing the completion of 220 sets of automated equipment for boiler units of large and medium-sized power plants, and providing 4,500 automated recording electronic instruments for thermal equipment such as smelting, rolling, coking, and heavy machinery. I feel that such a huge task was unimaginable in the past. Although the task is very arduous, it is also very glorious. With the leadership of the Party and the enthusiasm of the workers, I also have full confidence that I will be able to complete this task. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "Whether it is heavy industrial products or light industrial products, it is necessary to ensure excellent quality." As a private technical personnel, I must do my best in this glorious task!

Finally, in the past few days, I listened to the speeches of Bainqen Erdini, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Xirao Gyatso, and several other representatives at the conference, which made me clearer about the facts of the Tibetan rebels, and made me feel more hatred for the crimes of the rebels. I firmly support all measures taken by the government to quell the Tibetan rebellion. Tibet is an inseparable part of our country, and any foreign interference is absolutely not allowed by us. I feel无比的愤慨 at the extremely unfriendly and despicable actions of Indian interventionists who want to use the Tibetan issue. All their actions will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat!

### 我不愿退休了

　　我不愿退休了
    丁佐成委员说：在这个伟大的时代，正是技术人员为国家效力的最好机会，不要说我还只有六十几岁，就是七十几岁，八十几岁，也要尽我最大努力为建设社会主义尽一分光荣的责任主席、各位委员：
    我这次听到周总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，以及李维汉副主席的报告，表示完全拥护。
    李富春副总理报告中指示：“一九五九年的工业生产计划，首先注意了原材料工业和燃料、动力工业的发展。”我作为一个技术人员对于这一点特别感到兴奋。因为原料、材料数量和质量的问题，是我们技术人员在生产上日常所最注意的问题。实际上原料、材料问题是工业生产上的一个关键性问题。李副总理在报告中说：“只有有了更多的原料、材料，才能制造更多的机器，有了更多的原料、材料、燃料、动力和机器，才能使工业各部门以至国民经济各部门得到更快的发展。”这是完全正确的。我相信：随着一九五九年经济建设计划的完成，我国在工业生产上，原材料供应紧张状况，将会得到逐步的改变。这是使我感到非常兴奋的。但是我们还应当看到，随着生产的发展，原材料的需要也将更大，在一定时期内，原材料的紧张状况，也是不可能完全避免的，因此我们还是要千方百计克服困难和大力节约原材料的使用。
    我是上海大华仪表厂私方技术人员，在过去有一个时期由于我对于大跃进的意义认识不足，怕紧张，吃不消，想想自己年龄也已六十多岁了，反正有些储蓄，生活不成问题，因而曾经产生退休思想。
    通过去年大跃进的实际教育，使我看到公方和职工群众干劲真大，我每次深夜打电话到厂里去，公方厂长总是还在那里紧张地工作，工人同志下班以后，领导上一再劝他们回去休息，但是他们等一会偷偷地又回来工作了。不由得不使我扪心自问，他们究竟是为了什么呢？而我又是为了什么呢？
    后来，我下车间，时常与工人同志接触，又使我体会到他们的亲切感情，和对社会主义事业的真诚热爱。我在技术上的一些建议、意见，受到他们十分的欢迎和重视；而他们所提出来的许多问题和意见，却又往往是我所没有想得到的，使我得到许多启发。从这里不仅使我体会到工人群众的智慧，技术人员一定要与工人群众结合在一起，才能更好地发挥他的作用；同时更使我体会到，作为一个私方技术人员，在国家这样需要的时候，不把自己的一点点技术才能贡献出来，怎么能够安心呢？
    今年二三月间，我听了民建、工商联两会中央会议的传达后，我对党的“五不变”，“更为和风细雨”和“力所能及的劳动”等等政策精神的贯彻，尤有深切的感受，使我衷心感到党对我们资产阶级分子，真是无微不至的关怀，我们还不积极为社会主义服务，怎么对得起党呢？就在这个时候，我分析了自己原来的退休思想，是完全从个人主义出发，感到是十分错误的了。
    这一次我听到中央领导同志几个报告以后，对我们国家一九五八年的大跃进的意义，得到明确的认识。我们国家的社会主义建设飞跃前进，整个国家的经济面貌迅速改观，真是史无前例，怎么不使人无限感奋！周总理在报告中指出：“今年全国人民的主要任务，就是积极努力，为完成和超额完成这个以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗。”因此，我感觉到置身在这个伟大的时代，正是我们技术人员发挥一技之长为国家效力的最好机会，不要说我还只有六十几岁，就是我七十几岁、八十几岁，我也要尽我最大努力为建设社会主义尽我一分光荣的责任。同时周总理又给我们指出：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中，逐步地实现自我改造。”我一定要在积极为社会主义服务的实践中，努力来改造自己。
    我们大华仪表厂，今年的生产任务是为大中型发电站的锅炉机组提供自动化的装备，同时为冶炼、轧钢、炼焦等热力设备，提供自动化记录的电子仪表。最近第一机械工业部同中央广播电台举行广播竞赛大会，我们公方厂长在出席大会的广播中提出：“主机出厂，仪表跟上”的保证，保证完成大中型发电站锅炉机组自动化装备二百二十套及为冶炼、轧钢、炼焦、重型机械等热力设备提供自动记录的电子仪表四千五百台。我感觉到这样巨大的任务，在过去是不能想像的，虽然任务是十分艰巨的，但也是非常光荣的，有了党的领导和职工群众的干劲，我也有充分信心，一定能完成这个任务。李富春副总理在报告中说：“无论是重工业产品或者轻工业产品，都必需保证优良的质量。”我作一个私方技术人员，一定要在这个光荣的任务中尽我最大的努力！
    最后，我在前几天大会上听了班禅额尔德尼、阿沛·阿旺晋美、喜饶嘉错和其他几位代表的发言，使我对西藏叛乱分子的事实真相，更加清楚了，使我对叛乱分子的罪恶更加感到痛恨。我坚决拥护政府平息西藏叛乱的一切措施。西藏是我国不可分割的一部分，任何外国的干涉是我们决不容许的。对于印度的干涉主义分子要想利用西藏问题进行极不友好的鄙劣的举动，感到无比的愤慨。他们的一切举动，必然遭到可耻的失败！
