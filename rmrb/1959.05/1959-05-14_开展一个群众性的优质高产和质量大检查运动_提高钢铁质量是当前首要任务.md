    Launch a Mass Movement for High Quality, High Yield, and Quality Inspection
    Improving Steel Quality is the Current Top Priority
    Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Holds Telephone Conference, Points Out the Central Link is Reducing Sulfur Content in Pig Iron
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a telephone conference on the 11th, attended by metallurgical departments of various provinces and cities and key iron and steel enterprises, to specifically deploy the work of improving steel quality. The conference pointed out that improving the quality of steel is currently the central issue for the iron and steel industry, and all iron and steel enterprises should put improving product quality in the primary position of production work in May and June.

  In the first four months of this year, all regions have made achievements in ensuring and improving the quality of steel while increasing steel production. However, some of the steel produced by some enterprises still does not fully meet the requirements of national construction and machinery manufacturing. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry believes that to improve the quality of steel, the cadres of the iron and steel departments must first fully recognize the great significance of this issue. If there are many defective steel products, or if they do not meet the requirements of national construction or machinery manufacturing, it will cause huge waste to the iron and steel industry or other industries.

    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry pointed out that the central link in improving steel quality is improving the quality of pig iron, especially the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces. Grasping the central link of pig iron quality can promote the improvement of the quality of raw materials, fuels, and steel products, as well as the entire iron and steel industry.

    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry put forward specific goals and measures for improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces and steel from converters.

    To ensure the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, the fundamental problem is how to reduce the sulfur content. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry proposed that from now on, after two months of efforts, the qualification rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces in Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Hunan, Yunnan, and other provinces should be increased to more than 85% on the existing basis, and Sichuan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces should be increased to more than 70%; the national qualification rate of pig iron from small blast furnaces should strive to reach 90% in the third quarter. To achieve the above goals, according to the existing production experience of small blast furnaces across the country, the following measures must be taken: resolutely strive to ensure that all coking coal is washed and screened in the short term. This is the fundamental way to ensure the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, because 70% to 80% of the sulfur in pig iron comes from coal. The solution to the coal washing problem is to accelerate the construction of simple coal washing plants. Before the simple coal washing plants are put into production, soil methods should be used to wash coal immediately. Secondly, improve the grade of iron ore and reduce the particle size of the ore; high-sulfur iron ore and ore powder should be roasted and sintered by soil methods. In terms of improving the operation of small blast furnaces, methods such as using multi-nozzle combustion to increase wind temperature, using parallel blowers to increase air volume, and using quicklime instead of limestone as a solvent should be adopted to improve the output and quality of small blast furnaces. At the same time, strictly establish technical management systems, quality inspection systems, and operating procedures; workers who master the basic operation of blast furnaces should be fixed. In terms of production management, it is necessary to open more furnaces with good equipment and good iron output.

    The fundamental way to improve the quality of converter steel is for small blast furnaces to supply good iron to the converters. However, improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces requires a process, and converter production must also take measures at the same time to rapidly improve the quality of converter steel. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry proposed that the small blast furnaces in various provinces and cities that supply iron for converters should have fixed targets, so that the personnel working on the converters can better grasp the performance of the iron. Steel plants should implement classified management and treatment of pig iron; pig iron with a sulfur content of less than 0.2% can be used for converters, pig iron with a sulfur content of 0.3% to 0.5% should be desulfurized with alkaline iron melting furnaces, and pig iron with a higher sulfur content should be resolutely returned to the furnace. At the same time, improve the operation of converters, etc.

    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also put forward measures to improve the quality of open-hearth furnace and electric furnace steel.

    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry requires all iron and steel enterprises to launch a mass quality inspection movement to establish and improve various systems for improving product quality, and at the same time conduct ideological education for employees to improve quality.

### 开展一个群众性的优质高产和质量大检查运动  提高钢铁质量是当前首要任务

    开展一个群众性的优质高产和质量大检查运动
    提高钢铁质量是当前首要任务
    冶金部召开电话会议指出中心环节是降低生铁含硫量
    新华社13日讯  冶金工业部在11日召开了由各省市冶金部门和重点钢铁企业参加的电话会议，具体布置了提高钢铁质量的工作。会议指出，提高钢铁的质量是目前钢铁工业的中心问题，各钢铁企业5、6月份都应该把提高产品质量提到生产工作的首要地位。
  今年前四个月各地在提高钢铁产量的同时，保证和提高钢铁的质量是有成绩的。但是，仍有一些企业生产的钢铁，不能全部合乎国家建设和机械制造的要求。冶金工业部认为，要提高钢铁的质量，首先需要钢铁部门的干部充分地认识这一问题的重大意义。如果钢铁的废品多，或者不合乎国家建设或制造机械的要求，对于钢铁工业或其它工业，都会造成巨大的浪费。
    冶金工业部指出，提高钢铁质量的中心环节是提高生铁的质量，尤其是小高炉的生铁质量。抓住生铁质量这个中心环节，就可以促使炼铁的原料和燃料以及钢材等整个钢铁工业产品质量的提高。
    冶金工业部对于提高小高炉的生铁和转炉钢的质量，提出了具体目标和措施。
    保证小高炉的生铁质量，根本问题是如何降低含硫量。冶金工业部提出，从现在起，经过两个月的努力，山东、安徽、江苏、广东、湖南、云南等省小高炉的生铁的合格率，要在现有的基础上提高到85％以上，四川、湖北、河南、河北、山西以及其他各省要提高到70％以上；全国小高炉的生铁的合格率，争取在第三季度达到90％。要达到上述目标，根据全国小高炉已有的生产经验，必须采取以下的措施：坚决争取在短期内作到全部炼焦用煤都经过洗选。这是小高炉生铁质量过关的根本之道。因为生铁里面的硫有百分之七、八十来自煤炭。解决洗煤问题的办法是加快简易洗煤厂的建设，在简易洗煤厂未投入生产以前，应立即采用土办法洗煤。其次是提高铁矿石的品位，缩小矿石的粒度；高硫铁矿石和矿粉要进行焙烧和用土法烧结。在改进小高炉的操作方面，要采用多嘴燃烧提高风温，并联鼓风机加大风量，以及用生石灰代替石灰石作溶剂等方法，来提高小高炉的产量和质量。同时，严格建立技术管理制度，质量检验制度，操作规程；掌握高炉基本操作的工人要固定下来。在生产管理方面，目前要多开设备好、能出好铁的炉子。
    提高转炉钢的质量，根本的办法是小高炉要供应转炉好铁。但是，提高小高炉的生铁质量需要一个过程，而且转炉生产方面也必须同时采取措施才能迅速提高转炉钢的质量。冶金工业部提出，各省市供应转炉用铁的小高炉要固定对象，使在转炉上工作的人员能够更好地掌握铁的性能。炼钢厂对于生铁要实行分级管理和处理，含硫0.2％以下的可以供转炉用，含硫0.3％到0.5％的用碱性化铁炉脱硫，含硫再多的生铁坚决回炉。同时要改进转炉的操作等。
    冶金工业部还提出了提高平炉和电炉钢质量的措施。
    冶金工业部要求各钢铁企业，开展一次群众性的质量大检查运动，来建立和健全提高产品质量的各种制度，同时对职工进行提高质量的思想教育。
