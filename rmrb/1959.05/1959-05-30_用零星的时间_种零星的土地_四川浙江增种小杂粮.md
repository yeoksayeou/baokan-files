Use Spare Time to Cultivate Scattered Land
Sichuan and Zhejiang Increase Planting of Minor Grains

    Chengdu, May 29 (from our newspaper) Sichuan Province, while actively completing its major spring planting plan, is adopting various methods to expand the area under multiple cropping.
    Sichuan Province's experience of consecutive years of agricultural bumper harvests proves that expanding the area under multiple cropping, increasing land utilization, and implementing the policy of large-scale high yields and multiple harvests are the main paths to agricultural growth. In 1958, Sichuan Province, simply by increasing the multiple cropping index, fully utilizing non-cultivated land, implementing "planting wherever there's space," and actively increasing planting, produced an additional eighty billion catties of grain, accounting for approximately 20% of the total grain increase in the province last year. In order to ensure a greater increase in grain production this year, Sichuan Province is summarizing last year's experience of increased production and adopting several measures to guarantee abundant harvests.
    First, increase the multiple cropping index, fully utilize land, and plant late rice on a large scale. The areas along the Yangtze River, Tuo River, Jialing River, Qu River, and Fu River in Sichuan Province have high temperatures and long summers and autumns, making them suitable for double-cropping rice. These areas are now accelerating the sowing of late rice.
    Second, plant wherever there's space, not letting an inch of land go to waste, and increase planting of various minor grains and vegetables according to local conditions. Currently, people's communes in various places are generally using field ridges and corners, as well as land in front of and behind houses, to plant kudzu vine, scattered miscellaneous grains, melons, beans, vegetables, or other cash crops on a large scale. Mianyang Prefecture has planted an average of over 120 melon seedlings and over 500 bean seedlings per household.
    Third, vigorously promote intercropping and relay cropping. Xuyong County has formulated eleven intercropping and relay cropping methods, such as intercropping beans in cornfields and relay planting sorghum in beanfields, to expand the multiple cropping area. Shuiwei District of this county has also adopted the method of assigning tasks to work teams and individual commune members based on person, quota, and output to ensure the implementation of increased planting.
    During this period, all parts of the province also summarized last year's experience and strengthened ideological education for cadres and the masses, resolving some incorrect ideological issues regarding increased planting. At the same time, all localities are paying attention to strengthening leadership, conscientiously implementing agricultural production increase technologies, ensuring that there is planting and harvesting, and striving for high yields and multiple harvests.

    用零星的时间  种零星的土地
    四川浙江增种小杂粮
    本报成都29日电　四川省在积极完成大春播种计划的同时，采取多种方法扩大复种面积。
    四川省农业连年丰收的经验证明，扩大复种面积，提高土地利用率，实行大面积高产和多种多收方针，是农业增长的主要途径。1958年，四川省仅由于提高复种指数，充分利用非耕地，实行“见缝插针”，积极增种的结果，全省就多产了八十多亿斤粮食，约占去年全省粮食增产总数的20％左右。为了保证今年粮食的更大增产，四川省正在总结去年增产经验的基础上，采取几项措施，保证粮食多收。
    第一，提高复种指数，充分利用土地，大种晚稻。四川省长江、沱江、嘉陵江、渠江、涪江沿岸的地区，气温高，夏秋两季的时间长，适宜种双季稻。这些地区现在正在加速播种晚稻。
    第二，见缝插针，寸土不放，因地制宜，增种各种小杂粮、蔬菜等。目前，各地公社普遍利用田坎地角以及屋前房后的土地，大种堆堆苕、零星杂粮、瓜豆、蔬菜或其它经济作物。绵阳专区平均每户已种瓜一百二十多窝，种豆五百多窝。
    第三，大搞间种、套种。叙永县订出了玉米地内间种豆子，豆子地内套栽高粱等十一项间种套种的作法，扩大复种面积。这个县的水尾区还采取按人定等、定数、定产的办法，把增种落实到作业组和社员个人。
    在这期间全省各地还总结了去年的经验，加强了对干部和群众的思想教育工作，解决了增种问题上的一些不正确的思想问题。同时各地还注意加强领导，认真贯彻农业增产技术，保证有种有收，力争高产多收。　（朱实）
