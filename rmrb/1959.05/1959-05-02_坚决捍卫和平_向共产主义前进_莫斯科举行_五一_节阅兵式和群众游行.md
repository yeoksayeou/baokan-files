Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 1st: A grand military parade and mass procession celebrating the "May 1st" International Labor Day was held today on Red Square in Moscow, under a sea of red flags.

Representatives of Soviet working people from various production posts and guests from various countries stood on the viewing stands on both sides of the reviewing platform and the newly built viewing platform opposite the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum.

When Soviet Party and government leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and Polyansky ascended the reviewing platform on the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum, warm applause resounded in Red Square.

At exactly 10 o'clock, the military band played music, and the parade began. Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Malinovsky, accompanied by Marshal Moskalenko, commander of the Moscow Military District, inspected the spirited Soviet armed forces lined up in Red Square and nearby streets in open-top cars and extended festive greetings to the Soviet officers and soldiers under review. Then, Marshal Malinovsky ascended the reviewing platform and delivered a festive speech to the Soviet army and all Soviet working people.

Malinovsky said that the Soviet people resolutely defend peace and are always loyal to Lenin's peaceful foreign policy. In the recent period alone, the Soviet government has put forward a series of proposals aimed at easing international tensions, such as resolving the German issue and the Berlin issue, stopping nuclear weapons testing, and disarmament. However, the ruling groups of Western countries have tried every possible way to oppose the Soviet Union's peace initiatives and to oppose easing international tensions. They have put a lot of effort into hindering the creation of a favorable atmosphere for the upcoming East-West negotiations. Marshal Malinovsky emphasized in his speech that the United States' conclusion of bilateral military agreements with Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, the establishment of many new military bases around the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and West Germany's intensified militarization are all aimed at sharpening international relations and stirring up war hysteria.

Marshal Malinovsky emphasized that there is no force in the world that can defeat the socialist camp. If the aggressors dare to disrupt the peaceful labor of the Soviet people, the Soviet armed forces are ready at any moment to give them a fatal blow.

Marshal Malinovsky said that the Soviet people are celebrating "May 1st" as the motherland enters a period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society. After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, building communism has become the practical activity of hundreds of millions of Soviet people. Currently, a socialist labor competition to achieve the Seven-Year Plan victoriously has been launched nationwide. Judging from the completion of the production plan in the first quarter of this year, it is entirely believable that the Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed but also overfulfilled.

Marshal Malinovsky pointed out that the people of great China and all People's Democratic countries are advancing towards the bright future of all mankind—communism—like a harmonious and united family.

Next, the parade's march-past began amidst majestic military music. Leading the way were students from Soviet military academies, who marched neatly past the reviewing stand to the rhythm of the music. Following them were mechanized corps, tank teams, paratrooper units, self-propelled artillery units, and rocket artillery units that had repeatedly performed meritorious deeds in the Great Patriotic War against German fascism. They are representatives of the invincible and powerful Soviet armed forces.

The parade lasted for forty minutes. Then, the laboring people's festive procession began. A team of colorful motorcades led the way, with young men and women dressed in the costumes of various Soviet nationalities, symbolizing the friendship of all nationalities, standing on the cars. They held high large and clear banners with the slogan "Communism Will Surely Triumph" and huge portraits of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. They showed the heroic posture of the Soviet people heading towards communism with full confidence of victory.

Following them was a vibrant team of athletes. They performed graceful rhythmic gymnastics and various formations as they marched.

The teams of workers from Moscow's factories and collective farms participated in the procession with particularly warm emotions this year. They held high red flags, carried placards with the words "We Must Fulfill the Seven-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule" and "We Must Implement the Resolutions of the 21st Congress," and charts showing their determination to overfulfill the production plan. This high political enthusiasm for resolutely striving to victoriously complete the Seven-Year Plan inspired everyone.

Teams of workers, peasants, students, and scientists passed the reviewing stand one after another, enthusiastically cheering their Party and government leaders and foreign guests.

The mass procession continued for more than two hours.

    坚决捍卫和平　向共产主义前进
    莫斯科举行“五一”节阅兵式和群众游行
    新华社莫斯科1日电　今天，莫斯科在红旗招展的红场上举行了盛大的庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的阅兵式和群众游行。
    来自各生产岗位上的苏联劳动人民的代表们和各国来宾们站在检阅台两旁的观礼台和列宁斯大林陵墓对面的新建成的观礼台上。
    当苏联党和政府领导人阿里斯托夫、勃列日涅夫、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、和波利扬斯基登上列宁斯大林陵墓上的检阅台的时候，红场上响起了热烈的掌声。
  十时正，军乐队奏起乐曲，阅兵式开始了。苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在莫斯科军区司令莫斯卡连科元帅陪同下，分乘敞篷汽车检阅了英姿勃勃的排列在红场和附近街道上的苏联武装部队，并向接受检阅的苏军官兵致以节日的祝贺。接着，马利诺夫斯基元帅登上检阅台，向苏联军队和苏联全体劳动人民发表了节日演说。
    马利诺夫斯基说，苏联人民坚决捍卫和平，始终忠于列宁的和平外交政策。仅在最近一个时期，苏联政府就提出了关于解决德国问题和柏林问题，关于停止核武器试验和裁减军备等一系列旨在缓和国际紧张局势的建议，但是，西方国家统治集团千方百计地反对苏联的和平倡议，反对缓和国际紧张局势，它们花了不少力气阻挠为即将举行的东西方谈判创造良好的气氛。马利诺夫斯基元帅在讲话中强调指出，美国同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦缔结双边军事协定、在苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的四周建立许多新的军事基地，使西德加紧军国主义化，所有这一切都是为了使国际关系尖锐化和煽起战争歇斯底里。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅强调指出，世界上没有能够击败社会主义阵营的力量，如果侵略者胆敢破坏苏联人民的和平劳动，苏联的武装部队随时随刻都准备给予他们以致命的打击。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，苏联人民是在祖国进入了全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期来庆祝“五一”节的。在苏共第二十一次代表大会之后，建设共产主义成为亿万苏联人民的实际活动。目前全国已经展开了为胜利实现七年计划的社会主义劳动竞赛。从今年第一季度生产计划的完成情况看来，完全可以相信，七年计划不仅能够完成，而且能够超额完成。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅指出，伟大的中国和所有人民民主国家的人民像一个和睦团结的家庭一样，朝着全人类的光辉未来——共产主义前进。
    接着，阅兵的分列式在雄壮的军乐声中开始了。走在前面的是苏联各军事学院的学员，他们按着军乐节奏，整齐地通过检阅台前，随后是在抗击德国法西斯的卫国战争中屡建功勋的机械化兵团、战车队、伞兵部队、自动推进炮队和火箭炮队。它们是战无不胜的强大的苏联武装力量的代表。
    阅兵式进行了四十分钟。接着，劳动人民节日游行开始了。一队装饰得五彩缤纷的汽车队为前导，车上站着穿着苏联各民族服装、象征各族人民友谊的青年男女，他们高举着“共产主义一定要胜利”的大幅鲜明标语和马克思、恩格斯、列宁的巨幅画像，他们表现了苏联人民满怀胜利的信心走向共产主义的英雄姿态。
    随后，是朝气勃勃的运动员队伍。他们在行进时表演着优美的艺术体操和各种队形。
    莫斯科各工厂和农庄的劳动者代表的队伍今年以特别热烈的情绪参加了游行。他们高举着红旗，抬着写着“一定要提前完成七年计划”、“一定要实现二十一大决议”的标语牌和他们坚决要超额完成生产计划的指标图表。他们这种坚决争取胜利完成七年计划的高涨的政治热情鼓舞着每一个人。
    工人、农民、学生和科学家的队伍陆续走过检阅台前，向自己的党和政府领导人和外国来宾热情地欢呼。
    群众游行继续了两个多小时。
