    At Anshan Iron and Steel No. 9 Blast Furnace
    By our reporter Wang Dianxue and Sun Minghui
    A year ago, among the ten large blast furnaces towering in Anshan Iron and Steel, No. 9 blast furnace was the most backward in production. At that time, people used big-character posters to criticize this No. 9 brother for “not being ambitious,” questioning it, “The equipment is advanced and the conditions are good, why is the production the last?” and advising it to “speed up and catch up.” A year later, its utilization coefficient is far ahead among the ten brothers, and everyone is learning from it, using big-character posters to praise it again. Not long ago, it won the honorary title of "Advanced Collective" from Anshan City and Liaoning Province.
    In the past year, the changes in this steel giant have indeed been amazing. Its utilization coefficient has increased from 1.348 in March of last year to 2.051 in April of this year, and even reached 2.173 in the first half of May, entering the ranks of the world's advanced blast furnaces. Now, the molten iron it spits out every day is more than 51% higher than a year ago. Its achievement lies not only in increasing pig iron production for the country, but more importantly, it has opened the eyes of Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking workers, dispelled the superstition that the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces cannot break through the two-ton mark, and encouraged people's confidence in marching towards the peak of ironmaking technology.
    	People and Furnace in Harmony
    The young furnace chief, Pei Wei, always emphasized the leadership of the Party branch when introducing the achievements of the blast furnace, saying that the Party branch twisted all the workers in the furnace into one rope.
    Originally, the several foremen of No. 9 blast furnace were not united before. They were not convinced by each other and led their shifts according to their own technical viewpoints and habits. This problem was reflected in production, and the furnace condition often became abnormal. The furnace belly of a blast furnace is similar to a person's intestines and stomach. It has to "digest" several thousand tons of ore and coke every day and turn it into molten iron. If the three shift foremen operate inconsistently, feeding it too much or too little, making it cold for a while and hot for a while, disrupting its normal "life" rhythm, it will suffer from "indigestion." In order to solve this problem, the Party branch mobilized workers to conduct debates, criticized erroneous ideas, and established a production meeting system to regularly discuss operational policies and continuously unify operational thinking. The unification of operational thinking has made the relationship between the three shifts, foremen, and workers more and more harmonious, and the production of the blast furnace has been improving day by day.
    Foreman and Party branch secretary Jie Minggui, who came from a worker's background, is an active figure in No. 9 blast furnace. He often leads by example and improves the relationship between workers. When he is on duty, he not only operates with the workers, but also takes the lead in creating conditions for those leaving work and takes the lead in maintaining good relations with other foremen. Once, he and Pei Wei were on duty together. According to the division of labor, he was responsible for mastering the furnace conditions in the instrument room, and Pei Wei was in charge of the operation in front of the furnace. But soon the workers could not tell who was in charge of the furnace and who was in charge of the front of the furnace. Jie Minggui ran to the front of the furnace to observe the operation for a while, and furnace chief Pei Wei went to the instrument room to analyze the furnace conditions for a while, helping each other. After some time, due to the unfavorable furnace conditions, the blast furnace was in danger of slagging, and it needed to run slag. Jie Minggui thought of the dangerous situation of the slag flying around when the slag was running, and immediately ran to the front of the furnace to help Pei Wei direct, and personally operated, which made Pei Wei very moved. They also had disputes, but after the disputes, they always implemented unified operational policies.
    Teamwork among the shifts, foremen, furnace chiefs, and workers has formed a fashion in No. 9 blast furnace. One night not long ago, only twenty minutes were left before the shift workers of Team A got off work. Due to insufficient molten iron ladles, there were still three ladles of molten iron stuck in the furnace. According to the previous situation, they could get off work without tapping the iron again. But the foreman and the workers discussed and believed that if the iron was not tapped immediately, it would cause difficulties for the next shift, so they sent someone to contact the dispatching room, brought in the molten iron ladles, and decided to tap the iron again. Tapping the iron one more time is not simple, which means that the workers will sweat more. But none of the workers hesitated. They laid the tap hole, and opened the tap hole with a steel bar. The golden molten iron roared and flowed out. It was more than twenty minutes past the time to get off work, but they were still working hard with the workers who had just started work, until the workers who got off work repeatedly urged them to leave their posts.
    There is a saying circulating among the workers of No. 9 blast furnace: "People and furnaces are in harmony." Indeed, since the Party branch strengthened political and ideological work and production leadership of the blast furnace, all the workers in the furnace are as united as one person, and the blast furnace seems to have no weird temper and obediently spits out more and more molten iron.
    	Be the Master of the Blast Furnace
    People who come to visit No. 9 blast furnace cannot help but admire the workers' full revolutionary spirit and realistic spirit of studying science and technology. It is precisely because the workers closely combine revolutionary spirit with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts in their daily production activities that they have truly become the masters of controlling the blast furnace, making the blast furnace obedient, and pushing ironmaking technology to a new peak.
    The twenty-four-year-old furnace chief, Pei Wei, is one of these people who love new things and have an unremitting spirit of research. He has only been working on the blast furnace for more than three years. Judging from his age, he seems incompatible with the modern large blast furnace of No. 9, but he is now indeed a knowledgeable and proficient furnace chief. A year ago, when he was still the furnace chief of No. 8 blast furnace, he boldly opposed the theory of maintaining medium smelting intensity that was popular in the whole factory at that time, based on the experience of other factories, and actively advocated adopting innovative measures to improve smelting intensity, and took the lead in implementing this new measure on No. 8 blast furnace. As a result, No. 8 blast furnace became the most advanced blast furnace in the factory. Soon after, he was transferred to No. 9 blast furnace. Together with other foremen, he actively promoted the production-increasing measures of increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio simultaneously. After his day and night research, he successively tested and successfully increased the diameter of the tuyere to blow more air, and added more steam to solve the problem of insufficient blower capacity. New methods such as these allowed the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace to rise rapidly. However, making various innovative measures truly conform to the objective conditions of the blast furnace is not easy, and requires a huge price of labor.
    The operation of a modern large blast furnace that can swallow thousands of tons of ore and coke every day is extremely complex. Unlike other production, workers can only see cans of raw materials and tap iron time and time again. The situation inside the blast furnace is simply invisible and untouchable. They can only rely on dozens of complex instruments to know the changes in the furnace. What is even more difficult to grasp is that there are many objective factors that affect the production of the blast furnace, and the blast furnace is particularly sensitive to the changes of these factors. For example, if there are more small pieces of coke, the strength is poor, or the iron content of the sinter fluctuates, it will have difficulty in "breathing" and suffer from "indigestion." However, although the technology on the blast furnace is complex, the production of the blast furnace always has its own laws. The workers of No. 9 blast furnace have made many arduous efforts to master these laws.
    Continuously researching and innovating technology, and establishing new technology on the basis of objective possibilities, is a prominent feature of the production of No. 9 blast furnace. Early on, they established a system for conducting technical analysis on a shift, ten-day, and monthly basis, so that they can often grasp the changes in objective conditions, and take corresponding measures according to objective conditions at any time. This is also the operational secret of "attack, defend, retreat" that they have summarized, that is, implementing an attack when conditions are good, and adopting defense or retreat when conditions are bad. This secret has kept their production steadily rising.
      Skillfully  Break  Through  Difficulties
    During the Great Leap Forward, No. 9 blast furnace encountered many difficulties. But in the face of the wisdom and perseverance of the heroes, these difficulties were conquered one by one, and the production of the blast furnace continued to leap forward on this basis.
    Not long ago, with the increase of smelting intensity, the air volume seemed to be very insufficient, which posed a great threat to the continued increase of production. Xu Zhenye, an old front-line worker and advanced producer who has been working on blast furnaces for nearly twenty years, has been paying attention to this matter for a long time. He saw that sometimes when tapping iron, because the tap hole was shallow, the molten iron would spray coke while flowing, and he had to temporarily reduce the air volume, and a reduction in air volume would be dozens of cubic meters. In order to find the root cause, he not only carefully observed the situation of blocking the tap hole in his own shift, but also often observed the situation of blocking the tap hole in other shifts during his days off or before and after shifts. After continuous observation and research, Xu Zhenye finally discovered that if he hit the mud ball blocking the tap hole less, the tap hole would be deeper, and he could avoid reducing the air volume when tapping iron. Sure enough, after he suggested hitting less mud balls, the depth of the tap hole often remained at 1.8 meters, and the loss of air volume has been greatly reduced since then. While reducing the loss of air volume, the ironmaking workers also took the method of adding more water to the hot air to supplement the limitations of insufficient blower capacity and solve the difficulty of insufficient air volume.
    At the same time as the problem of insufficient air volume appeared, the problem of low hot air temperature was also discovered. Chen Quan, a hot blast stove worker, was very anxious about this matter, and kept turning around the three round and tall hot blast stoves every day, always thinking about how to increase the temperature of the hot air. After repeated research, he added more gas and air to the hot blast stove according to various ratios, trying to find the law of increasing the temperature of the hot blast stove. In this way, after more than 30 experiments, he improved the combustion system of the hot blast stove, increasing the hot air temperature from more than 800 degrees to 900 degrees, ensuring the needs of reducing the coke ratio.
    In No. 9 blast furnace, many people like this who use their wisdom and perseverance to overcome difficulties can be found.
             ×  ×  ×
    Through the joint efforts of all the workers in the furnace, No. 9 blast furnace has made great progress in production and become a red flag for large blast furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel. But the workers are not satisfied at all. Not long ago, they put forward a new combat goal, determined to increase the blast furnace utilization coefficient from the current 2.1 or more to 2.4 or more, and seize the national large blast furnace high-quality and high-yield red flag from Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant. Recently, the red flag bearers fighting in No. 9 blast furnace have launched a vigorous competition upsurge, striving to realize their lofty ambitions in a not too long time, and let the national high-quality and high-yield red flag of large and medium-sized blast furnaces fly over the sky of Anshan Iron and Steel.

    在鞍钢九高炉
    本报记者  王殿学  孙铭惠
    一年前，在鞍钢巍峨耸立的十座大型高炉中，要算九号高炉的生产最落后。那时候，人们用大字报批评这位九弟“不争气”，质问它“设备先进条件好，为啥生产倒数第一”？劝它“快马加鞭赶上来。”一年后，它的利用系数在十兄弟中遥遥领先，大家向它学习，又用大字报来表扬它。不久以前，它获得了鞍山市和辽宁省“先进集体”的光荣称号。
    一年来，这个钢铁巨人的变化的确惊人，它的利用系数已经从去年3月份的一点三四八，提高到今年4月份的二点零五一，5月上半月更达到了二点一七三，跨进了世界先进高炉的行列。现在，每天从它嘴里吐出的铁水，比一年前提高了51％以上。它的成就，不仅在于自己给国家增产了生铁，更重要的还在于它打开了鞍钢炼铁职工的眼界，破除了大型高炉利用系数不能突破两吨大关的迷信，鼓舞了人们向炼铁技术高峰进军的信心。
        人和炉子顺
    年青的炉长裴伟，每当向人家介绍高炉的成绩时，总是滔滔不绝地强调党支部的领导，说党支部把全炉职工扭成了一股绳。
    原来，九高炉的几个工长之间，在以前并不团结，他们互不服气，各自按照自己的一套技术观点和习惯领导本班进行操作。这问题反应在生产上，就是炉况常常失常。高炉的炉腹同人的肠胃相似，它每天要把吞进去的几千吨矿石和焦炭，经过“消化”变成铁水吐出来，如果三班工长操作不一致，给它吃的多一口，少一口，叫它冷一阵，热一阵，破坏它的正常“生活”规律，它就要闹“消化不良”症。为了解决这个问题，党支部发动职工进行辩论，批判了错误思想，并建立了生产会议制度，定期讨论操作方针，不断地统一操作思想。操作思想的统一，使三班之间，工长和工人之间的关系，也越来越融洽，高炉的生产也就随着一天天好起来。
      工人出身的工长兼支部书记解明贵，是九高炉活跃的人物，他经常以身作则，搞好职工之间的关系。他值班的时候，不但同工人一起操作，而且还带头给下班创造条件，带头同其他工长搞好关系。有一次他同裴伟共同值班，按照分工，他负责在仪表室掌握炉况，裴伟在炉前掌握操作，但是不久工人们就分不清他俩究竟谁掌握炉内谁掌握炉前了。一会儿解明贵跑到炉前观察操作，一会儿炉长裴伟又去仪表室里分析炉内情况，两人互相帮助。过了一些时候，由于炉况不顺，高炉有发生灌渣事故的危险，需要跑渣。解明贵想到跑渣时渣子乱飞的危险情况，马上跑到炉前帮助裴伟进行指挥，并且亲自动手操作，使裴伟十分感动。他俩也曾有过争论，但是经过争论后，总是执行统一的操作方针。
    各班之间、工长、炉长和工人之间团结协作，在九高炉已经形成了一种风尚。不久前的一个夜晚，离甲班工人下班只有二十分钟，高炉由于铁水罐不足，还有三罐铁水蹩在炉子里，按照以前的情况，他们不用再出铁就可以下班了。但是工长和工人们一商量，认为如果不马上出铁，就要给下一班造成困难，于是派人与调度室联系，调来了铁水罐，决定再出一次铁。多出一次铁并不简单，这意味着工人们要流出更多的汗。但工人们谁也没有迟疑，他们铺好出铁沟，用钢钎打开了出铁口，金光灿烂的铁水咆哮着滚滚流了出来。下班时间已过了二十多分钟，可是他们还同刚上班的工人一起紧张地劳动着，直到下班工人一再催促，他们才离开了岗位。
    九高炉的职工们中间，流传着一句话：“人和炉子顺”。的确，自从党支部加强了政治思想工作和对高炉的生产领导后，全炉职工团结得像一个人一样，而高炉也像没有了怪脾气，顺从地吐着越来越多的铁水。
        作高炉的主人
    来九高炉访问的人，对职工们那种充沛的革命干劲和钻研科学技术的求实精神，无不表示赞佩。正是职工们在日常生产活动中，把革命干劲同科学的求实精神紧密结合起来，他们才真正成为控制高炉的主人，使高炉听话，并把炼铁技术推向新的高峰。
    二十四岁的炉长裴伟，就是这些热爱新事物，有着孜孜不倦钻研精神的人们当中的一个。他在高炉上工作，还只有三年多的时间，从他的年岁上看，似乎同九高炉这座现代化大型高炉不相称，但他现在确确实实是一位内行的精通业务的炉长。在一年前，当他还是八高炉炉长的时候，他就根据别的工厂的经验大胆地反对当时在全厂里流行的维持中等冶炼强度的理论，积极提倡采用提高冶炼强度的革新措施，并且带头在八高炉上实行这一新的措施。结果八高炉成了全厂最先进的高炉。不久以后他调到九高炉，他同其他工长们一起，积极推行提高冶炼强度、降低焦比双管齐下的增产措施，并且经过他日夜不息的钻研，先后试验成功加大风口直径多吹风，多加蒸汽解决鼓风机能力不足等等新办法，使高炉的利用系数扶摇直上，但是使各种革新措施，真正符合高炉的客观情况，并不是容易的事，而且需要付出巨大的劳动代价。
    一座每天能吞进几千吨矿石和焦炭的现代化大高炉，操作极为复杂，它同其他的生产不同，工人们只能看见一罐罐装原料，一次次出铁，高炉内部的情况，简直是看也看不见，摸也摸不着，只能凭借着几十种复杂的仪表，才能知道炉内的变化。更难掌握的是影响高炉生产的客观因素很多，而高炉对这些因素的变化又特别敏感。比如焦炭小块多些，强度差些，或烧结矿铁分波动，它就“呼吸”困难，闹“消化不良”症。不过尽管高炉上的技术是复杂的，但高炉生产总还有它自己的规律。九高炉的职工们，为了掌握这些规律，曾经作了许多艰苦的努力。
    不断地钻研和革新技术，把新技术建立在客观可能的基础上，这是九高炉生产的一个显著特点。很早，他们就已建立了按班、按旬、按月进行技术分析的制度，从而能够经常掌握住客观条件的变化，并根据客观条件随时采取相应的措施，这也就是他们总结出来的在条件好时实行进攻，条件不好时采取防守或退却的“攻、守、退”的操作秘诀。这个秘诀使他们的生产一直稳步上升。
      巧  破  难  关
    在大跃进中，九高炉曾经遇到了许许多多的困难。但是在英雄们的智慧和毅力面前，这些困难都一个个被征服了，高炉的生产也就在这个基础上不断向前跃进。
    不久前，随着冶炼强度的提高，风量显得很不足，这对继续提高生产是个很大的威胁。在高炉上干了将近二十年的炉前老工人、先进生产者徐振业，很早就留心这件事了，他看到有时出铁，因为出铁口浅，铁水流着流着，就乱喷焦炭，不得不临时减风，一减风就是几十立方公尺。为了找到病根，他不但在本班仔细观察堵铁口的情况，还常常在公休时或交接班前后，观察别的班堵出铁口的情况。经过不断的观察研究，徐振业终于发现堵出铁口的泥球少打一些，出铁口就深，就可以避免出铁时减风。果然，他建议少打泥球后，出铁口的深度，常常保持在一点八公尺，从此风量的损失大大减少了。在减少风量损失的同时，炼铁职工们还采取了往热风里多加水的办法，补充了鼓风机能力不足的限制，解决了风量不足的困难。
    在出现风量不足的同时，还发现了热风温度低的问题。热风炉工人陈权，为这件事很发急，每天围着三个浑圆高大的热风炉直转转，老在琢磨怎么提高热风的温度。经过反复研究，他按照各种比例，往热风炉里多加瓦斯和空气，试图找到提高热风炉温度的规律。就这样，经过三十多次试验，他改进了热风炉燃烧制度，把热风温度从八百多度提高到九百度，保证了降低焦比的需要。
    在九高炉，像这种用自己的智慧和毅力战胜困难的人物，可以找到很多。
             ×  ×  ×
    九高炉经过全炉职工的共同努力，生产突飞猛进，成为鞍钢大型高炉的红旗。但是职工们一点也不满足。不久前，他们提出了新的战斗目标，决心把高炉利用系数从现在的二点一以上提高到二点四以上，把全国大型高炉优质高产红旗从本溪第一钢铁厂夺过来。最近一个时期，战斗在九高炉上的红旗手们，已经掀起一个轰轰烈烈的竞赛热潮，争取在不太长的时间内，实现自己的雄心壮志，让全国大中型高炉优质高产红旗在鞍钢的上空飘扬。
