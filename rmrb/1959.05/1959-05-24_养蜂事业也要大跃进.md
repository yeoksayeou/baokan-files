Beekeeping Should Also Leap Forward
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Under the guidance of the Party's correct policies, China's beekeeping production has greatly developed in recent years. In 1958, the number of bee colonies increased to three million, more than double the 1.4 million in 1957. The plan for 1959 is to increase it to six million colonies.

Beekeeping is a productive enterprise beneficial to the national economy, and it is also a good sideline for people's communes to develop diversified operations with little investment, high returns, and quick results. It does not occupy cultivated land, and it is a production that can be undertaken by women and semi-laborers. According to statistics from Conghua County, Guangdong Province, a beekeeper can create wealth of more than 2,000 yuan per year. This year, the Jiangpu People's Commune in the county can achieve an income of 246,000 yuan from beekeeping, which can be used as several months' wages for all commune members. In addition to producing honey, wax, and other valuable products, beekeeping has an even greater benefit: while collecting nectar, bees also help crops to fully pollinate, which has a very significant effect on increasing crop yields.

At the National Beekeeping On-site Conference jointly held by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce in Conghua County, Guangdong Province, a proposal was adopted advocating that the number of bee colonies in the country should reach six million in 1959 and the annual honey production should reach 80 million catties. This task is very arduous. To complete the above targets, it is necessary to vigorously raise native bees while developing foreign bees. Of the current three million bee colonies in the country, more than two-thirds are native bee species. Native bees are native to our country and have the characteristics of diligence, cold and heat resistance, and good at collecting scattered honey sources, making them an excellent bee species. However, in the past, it was always thought that native bees produced less honey and were not as good as foreign bees. In fact, the low honey production is not its nature, mainly due to poor management. Local experiences have proven that as long as the bee colonies in old-fashioned nests are transferred to movable-frame beehives and properly managed, the reproduction of bee colonies can be effectively controlled, and the honey collection can be greatly increased.

To complete the task of increasing the number of bee colonies by three million in 1959, plus the transfer of 1.2 million to 1.6 million native bee colonies to new hives, a large amount of materials such as beehives, beeswax foundation and thin lead wires will be required, and some difficulties will be encountered in supply. However, as long as the masses are fully mobilized and various substitutes are used, these difficulties can be solved. Conghua County in Guangdong Province has built bee houses with adobe bricks, and Beijing, Shanghai and other places have used artificial beeswax to manufacture beeswax foundation, which have achieved results and overcome the current shortage of raw materials for manufacturing beehives and beeswax foundation. These experiences should be summarized and promoted.

The honey source is the foundation of beekeeping production. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the types, distribution area, and flowering period of honey source plants is one of the basic constructions for the development of beekeeping production in our country. In order to develop beekeeping production in a planned way and rationally allocate bee colonies, Heilongjiang Province has initially completed the survey of honey source plants in the province. According to the survey, the province can accommodate about five million bee colonies, while there are currently only 100,000 bee colonies, which has great potential for development. This approach is of positive significance for the rapid and large-scale development of beekeeping production.

While doubling the development of beekeeping production, it is also necessary to train beekeeping technicians. If each beekeeper manages 30 bee colonies, 200,000 beekeepers will be needed for six million bee colonies. The experience of many advanced beekeeping areas has proven that holding short-term training courses, teaching while doing, and the method of masters teaching apprentices are effective ways to cultivate new forces in a fast, efficient and economical way.

Our country has a vast territory, from Hainan Island in the south to Heilongjiang in the north, everywhere is suitable for the development of beekeeping production. All localities should make proper arrangements according to specific conditions, so that beekeeping production in 1959 will have a greater leap forward.

    养蜂事业也要大跃进
    本报评论员
    在党的正确方针指导下，近年来我国的养蜂生产有了很大的发展。1958年蜜蜂发展到三百万群，比1957年的一百四十万群增加了一倍多，1959年计划增加到六百万群。
    养蜂是有利于国民经济的一种生产事业，也是人民公社在开展多种经营中一项投资少、收益多、收效快的好副业。它既不占用耕地，又是妇女和半劳动力可以从事的一种生产。根据广东省从化县的统计，一个养蜂员每年可以创造两千元以上的财富。该县江埔人民公社，今年在养蜂方面的收入，可以达到二十四万六千元，这笔现金收入，能作为全社社员几个月的工资。养蜂除了生产蜜、蜡以及其他有价值的产品外，还有更大的好处是：蜜蜂在采集花蜜的同时，又帮助了农作物进行充分的授粉，对提高农作物产量有着极其显著的效果。
    农业部和商业部在广东省从化县联合召开的全国养蜂现场会议上通过了一个倡议书，倡议1959年全国蜂群数量要达到六百万群和全年产蜜八千万斤。这个任务是很艰巨的。完成上述指标，必须在发展洋蜂的同时，大力饲养本国蜂。全国现有的三百万群蜜蜂当中，有三分之二以上是本国蜂种。本国蜂是我国土生土长的蜂种，具有勤劳、耐寒耐热、善于采集分散蜜源的特点，是一种优良蜂种。但是，过去总是认为本国蜂产蜜低，不如洋蜂好，其实产蜜少并不是它的本性，主要在于饲养管理不好。各地经验证明，只要把旧式巢里的蜂群，过到活框蜂箱里饲养，再加以适当的管理，就能有效地控制蜂群的繁殖，采蜜量就可以大大的提高。
    要完成1959年增殖三百万群蜜蜂的任务，再加上本国蜂过箱一百二十到一百六十万窝，就需要大量的蜂箱、巢础和细铅丝等物资，在供应上会遇到一些困难，但只要充分发动群众，利用各种代用品，这些困难是能够解决的。广东省从化县用土坯砌成蜂室，北京、上海等地用人工黄蜡制造巢础等，都已取得了成效，克服了目前制造蜂箱、巢础原料不足的困难。这些经验应该加以总结和推广。
    蜜源是养蜂生产的基础，因此，全面的了解蜜源植物的种类、分布面积、花期等情况，是发展我国养蜂生产的基本建设之一。黑龙江省为了有计划地发展养蜂生产，合理配置蜂群，初步完成了全省蜜源植物的调查工作，根据调查计算，全省约可容纳五百万群蜜蜂，而目前仅有蜂十万群，还大有发展的潜力。这种作法，对迅速大量的发展养蜂生产，是有积极意义的。
    在加倍发展养蜂生产的同时，还必须培养养蜂技术人员。如果按每个养蜂员管理三十群蜜蜂计算，六百万群蜂就需要二十万个养蜂员。许多先进养蜂地区的经验证明，举办短期训练班、边讲边作和以师傅带徒弟的办法是培养新生力量多快好省的有效方法。
    我国幅员广大，南自海南岛，北至黑龙江，到处适宜发展养蜂生产，各地应根据具体条件，妥善安排，使1959年养蜂生产来一个更大的跃进。
