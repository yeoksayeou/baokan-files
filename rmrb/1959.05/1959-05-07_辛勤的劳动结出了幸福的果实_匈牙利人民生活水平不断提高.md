　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 4th: Recent statistical materials show that the monetary income of residents throughout Hungary last year increased by 34% compared to 1955, approximately 22 billion forints. The entire nation is currently striving to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. This has created conditions that make it possible to achieve the living standards this year that were originally planned for 1960: to increase the actual income of workers by about 6% compared to 1957, and the income of farmers will also be further improved. According to statistics for the first quarter of this year, residents' income has already increased by 5% compared to the same period last year.

　　Since the beginning of spring this year, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government decided to increase preferential pensions by 25%, subsidies for families with many children by one to two times, and used 350 million forints to adjust and increase the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers and health workers. From January 1st this year, the retail prices of consumer goods such as lard, bacon, textiles, and clothing were also reduced, which allows residents to benefit by approximately 650 million forints annually.

　　With the increase in monetary income, residents' purchasing power is also growing. In 1958, the retail sales of socialist commerce (calculated at constant prices) increased by 23% compared to 1955. In the first quarter of this year, the retail sales of goods increased by another 7% compared to the same period last year. According to statistics, 75% of the increase in residents' purchasing power over the past three years has been used to exchange for industrial products, such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, televisions, and building materials. In the past year alone, the sales of washing machines and televisions have increased by more than two times compared to 1957. The sales volume of food last year increased by 12% compared to 1955. The sales volume of clothing last year increased by 28% compared to 1955.

　　The number of people owning personal transportation has also increased in the past three years. Last year, nearly 25,000 motorcycles and nearly 150,000 bicycles were sold. The number of people buying cars is also increasing day by day.

　　The sales volume of building materials has tripled in the past three years. In 1958, residents built 10,000 houses themselves.

　　辛勤的劳动结出了幸福的果实
    匈牙利人民生活水平不断提高
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　最近的统计材料表明，去年匈牙利全国居民的货币收入比1955年增加了34％，即二百二十亿福林左右。现在全国人民正在为提前一年完成三年计划的主要指标而奋斗。这样就创造了条件，使有可能在今年达到按原计划到1960年才能达到的生活水平：使职工的实际收入比1957年提高6％左右，农民的收入也将得到进一步的提高。根据今年第一季度的统计，居民的收入已经比去年同一时期增加了5％。
    今年开春以来匈牙利工农革命政府决定把优抚金提高25％，多子女家庭的补助金提高一倍到两倍，并用三亿五千万福林调整和提高中小学教员和卫生工作者的工资。从今年1月1日起又降低了猪油、咸肉、纺织品、服装等消费品的零售价格，这就使得居民每年可以得到约六亿五千万福林的好处。
    随着货币收入的增加，居民的购买力也日益增长。1958年，社会主义商业的零售额（以不变价格计算）比1955年增加了23％。今年第一季度商品的零售额又比去年同时期增加了7％。据统计，三年以来，居民购买力所增长的75％是被用来换取工业产品，如洗衣机、吸尘器、电视机及建筑材料等。单在去年一年，洗衣机和电视机的出售量就比1957年增加了两倍以上。食品的销售量去年比1955年增加了12％。服装的销售量去年比1955年增加了28％。
    过去三年中拥有自备交通工具的人数也增加。去年共卖出了将近两万五千辆摩托车和将近十五万辆自行车。购买小汽车的人也一天比一天增多。
    建筑材料的出售量三年来增加了三倍。1958年居民自己建筑的住宅达一万套。
