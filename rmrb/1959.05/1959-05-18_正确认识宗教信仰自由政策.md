    Correctly Understand the Policy of Religious Freedom
    Du Hua'an

    Everyone is completely free to believe in any religion or not to believe in any religion. This is the consistent proposition of Marxists. We are materialists, so we do not believe in any religion; at the same time, we are historical materialists and understand the reasons for the emergence and development of religion and its long-term existence, so we advocate religious freedom. It is from this principle that our Party has adopted a policy of long-term respect for the people's freedom of religious belief.
    People's religious concepts and religious beliefs have their roots. Simple religious concepts arose at a certain stage of development in primitive society, and in class society, systematic religions were formed. Due to the exploitation of the exploiting classes, religion greatly developed. The emergence, existence, and development of religion show us two fundamentally different situations in religious issues: on the one hand, the oppressed and exploited working people have a devout belief in God and Buddhas due to their lack of understanding of natural and social forces; on the other hand, the exploiters and oppressors use religion to numb the people and use it as a tool of class rule. This situation is very evident in Qinghai. In our province's democratic reforms, socialist transformation, and socialist construction, a small handful of reactionary elements in religion have consistently and actively carried out counter-reform and counter-revolutionary activities. They also use religious activities as a means to extremely and cruelly oppress, exploit, and humiliate the masses. The reactionary elements in religion use religious activities to confront the Party and the state's policies and decrees everywhere. Last year, these people openly opposed socialism and the Communist Party, murdered revolutionary cadres, and especially cruelly persecuted activists among their own ethnic groups. Their oppression of the masses was also extremely ruthless.
    From the above situation, we can see that there are two types of issues with different natures in religious temples and monasteries: one is the general belief issue of the masses; the other is the anti-people, counter-revolutionary issue of the reactionary elements. From this, we can see that in religious work, we encounter two fundamentally different situations: one is the contradiction among the people; the other is the contradiction between the enemy and us. For contradictions among the people, we must adhere to the policy of religious freedom; for contradictions between the enemy and us, we must resolutely eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements in religious garb, and resolutely abolish the feudal privileges and the system of oppression and exploitation of religious temples and monasteries. Adhering to religious freedom and eliminating counter-revolutionaries are two absolutely distinct matters that cannot be confused.
    What is religious freedom? It means: it is free to believe in religion or not to believe in religion; it is free to believe in this religion or that religion; it is also free to believe in religion now and not to believe in religion in the future, or not to believe in religion now and to believe in religion in the future. Religious freedom means that belief or non-belief is entirely determined by oneself, and no one else may interfere. There should be such a comprehensive understanding of religious freedom.
    First, Communists believe that religion is an inevitable phenomenon of social development and a historical category. It has its inevitable laws of emergence, development, and demise. Therefore, people can only free themselves from the state of being enslaved spiritually when they have the power to get rid of the political and economic rule of the exploiting classes; only when people have the power to control their own destiny can they get rid of the supernatural special forces that dominate them, such as God, Buddhas, Allah, etc. The Party and the People's Government do not use administrative orders or hasty and simplistic methods to interfere or restrict, but mainly rely on the development of political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings and the practice of social production struggles to naturally enable the masses to gradually understand the essence of religion.
    Second, we believe that religious belief is a matter of personal belief, a matter of thought. Belief is free. We say that religion is idealistic and anti-scientific, referring to the essence and role of this social ideology, which belongs to the category of thought and consciousness. We say that religion plays an anti-people role in class struggle, referring to the control and use of religion by the exploiting classes. However, we have always strictly distinguished between the religious beliefs of the masses and the activities of the reactionary classes using religion to carry out anti-people and counter-revolutionary activities. As a matter of thought, the change of this ideology, the problem of thought and belief, cannot be solved by administrative orders and interference or prohibition. Therefore, how to treat the religious issue is related to how to treat the thought problems of the masses.
    Third, the religious issue is related to the national issue, and to some extent, it is a component of the national issue. Islam and Lamaism have historically played a role in hindering the awakening of the working people of the Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups and hindering the progress of these ethnic groups. On the other hand, they have also played a role in uniting the people of these ethnic groups against foreign oppression. At the same time, some religious customs have become national customs in the long-term development. However, the bonding role of religion has lost its social foundation today, while the situation in which religious customs and national customs are indistinguishable in some aspects still exists today. Due to these situations, the religious issue still needs to be handled with caution. At the same time, imperialists and all reactionaries are also trying their best to use the religious issue to sow discord among the various ethnic groups in our country, and we must be highly vigilant against this. In addition, some people equate religion with ethnicity, believing that religion is ethnicity, which is incorrect. Although religion and ethnicity are related, they are two different things. Religion is an ideology, while ethnicity is a community of people; a religion can have several ethnic groups believing in it, and there can be people of different religious beliefs in an ethnicity; religion arose in primitive society, while the formation of ethnicity is a modern matter. Therefore, the view that equates religion with ethnicity is obviously wrong.
    Based on this understanding of religion, Communists have adopted a long-term policy of protecting the people's freedom of religious belief, while advocating that the feudal privileges and feudal exploitation of religion must be abolished, because these things are the most serious obstacles to the thorough liberation of the people and the development of the nation, which is different from religious belief. It also requires that religious believers must love the country and abide by the law, and does not allow anyone to use religion to engage in activities that violate the country's constitution and are counter-revolutionary, damaging the interests of all ethnic groups. Moreover, it is also necessary to publicize materialism, atheism, natural science, and social science knowledge in society. Publicizing these things is not contradictory to advocating religious freedom. Because only in this way can different viewpoints be presented for the people to freely choose, and can religious freedom be fully implemented.

### 正确认识宗教信仰自由政策

    正确认识宗教信仰自由政策
    杜华安
    任何人都可以完全自由地信仰任何宗教，或不信仰任何宗教。这是马克思主义者一贯的主张。我们是唯物主义者，所以不信仰任何宗教；同时我们又是历史唯物主义者，懂得宗教的产生和发展以至长期存在的原因，所以主张宗教信仰自由。正是从这个原则出发，我们党采取了长期尊重人民宗教信仰自由的政策。
    人们的宗教观念和宗教信仰是有它的根源的。朴素的宗教观念在原始社会发展的一定阶段上就产生了，而在阶级社会里形成了系统的宗教，并且由于剥削阶级的利用大大地发展了宗教。宗教产生、存在和发展的情况，使我们从宗教问题中看到两种根本不同的情形：一方面是被压迫、被剥削的劳动人民由于对自然力量和社会力量的不理解而产生的对上帝、对神佛的虔诚的信仰；一方面是剥削者、压迫者利用宗教麻醉人民并利用宗教作为阶级统治的工具。这种情形，在青海看得非常明显。我省在民主改革、社会主义改造和社会主义建设中，宗教中的一小撮反动分子一贯积极进行着反改造的反革命活动，他们并以宗教活动为手段，极力的残酷的压迫、剥削与侮辱群众。宗教中的反动分子利用宗教活动，处处对抗党和国家的政策法令，到去年，这些人公开反对社会主义、反对共产党，杀害革命干部，特别是残害本民族中的积极分子，他们对群众的压迫也是无所不用其极。
    从上述情况，我们可以看出宗教寺院中有两类不同性质的问题：一类是群众的一般信仰问题；一类是反动分子的反人民、反革命的问题。由此我们可以看出，在宗教工作上，遇到两种根本不同的情况：一种是人民内部矛盾；一种是敌我矛盾。对于人民内部矛盾，我们必须坚持宗教信仰自由政策；对于敌我矛盾，我们必须坚决肃清披着宗教外衣的反革命分子，坚决废除宗教寺院的封建特权和压迫剥削制度。坚持宗教信仰自由和肃清反革命，是绝不能混同的两件事。
    什么叫宗教信仰自由呢？这就是：信教或者不信教是自由的；信仰这种教或者那种教，是自由的；现在信教，将来不信教，或者现在不信教，将来又信教，也是自由的。宗教信仰自由，就是信仰与不信仰完全由自己决定，别人不得干涉。对宗教信仰自由应该有这样的全面的认识。
    第一，共产党人认为宗教是社会发展的必然现象，宗教是一个历史范畴，它有它的产生、发展和消亡的必然规律。因此，人们只有当他们有力量摆脱剥削阶级在政治上和经济上的统治的时候，才可能摆脱自身精神上的被奴役的状态；当人们自己有力量掌握自己命运的时候，才能摆脱支配人们的超自然的特殊力量，即上帝、神佛、真主等。现在事实上还有人信教，党和人民政府，不是用行政命令、急躁简单的办法去干涉、限制，而主要地是依靠政治、经济、文化教育事业的发展和社会生产斗争的实践，自然地使群众逐步认识宗教的实质。
    第二，我们认为宗教信仰是一个人的个人信仰问题，是思想问题。信仰是可以自由的。我们说宗教是唯心的，是反科学的，是指宗教的这种社会意识形态的本质及其作用而说的，而这是属于思想意识的范畴。我们说宗教在阶级斗争中起着反人民的作用，是指宗教被剥削阶级控制和利用而说的。但是，我们从来就严格区别群众的宗教信仰问题和反动阶级利用宗教进行反人民、反革命的活动的界限的。宗教作为思想问题来说，这种意识形态的改变，思想、信仰问题，不是用行政命令和干涉禁止的办法能够解决的。因此，如何对待宗教问题，是关系如何对待群众的思想问题的。
    第三，宗教问题和民族问题有关系，在某种程度上说，它是民族问题的组成部分。伊斯兰教、喇嘛教在历史上一方面起过阻碍回、藏等民族劳动人民的觉悟，阻碍这些民族的进步的作用，另一方面也还起过团结这些民族人民反对外来压迫的纽带作用，同时，一些宗教习惯在长期的发展中也变成了民族的习惯。但是宗教的纽带作用，在今天已失去其社会基础了，而宗教习惯和民族习惯在某些方面不分的情况，今天依然存在。由于这些情况，对于宗教问题仍然要慎重处理。同时，帝国主义和一切反动派，也都在竭力利用宗教问题挑拨我国各民族之间的关系，对此我们必须提高警惕。另外，有人把宗教和民族等同起来，认为宗教就是民族，这是不对的。宗教和民族虽然有关系，但是，却是两回事。宗教是一种意识形态，而民族却是一个人们的共同体；一个宗教可以有几个民族信仰，一个民族中也可以有不同的宗教信仰的人；宗教是在原始社会就产生了，而民族的形成却是近代的事。因此，把宗教和民族等同起来的看法，显然是错误的。
    根据对宗教的这种认识，共产党人就采取了长期保护人民宗教信仰自由的政策，同时主张宗教的封建特权和封建剥削必须废除，因为这些东西是妨害人民彻底解放和民族发展的最严重的障碍，它同宗教信仰是两回事。并且要求宗教徒必须爱国守法，并且不允许任何人利用宗教进行违背国家宪法和反革命的活动，破坏各族人民的利益。而且在社会上还要宣传唯物主义、无神论、自然科学和社会科学知识。宣传这些东西和主张宗教信仰自由是不矛盾的。因为只有这样，才能摆出不同的观点来让人民自由选择，才是全面的实行了宗教信仰自由。
