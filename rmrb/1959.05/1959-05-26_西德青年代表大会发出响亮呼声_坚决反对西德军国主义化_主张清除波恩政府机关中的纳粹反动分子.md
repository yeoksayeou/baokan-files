Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 25th: A youth congress initiated by the West German Socialist Student League, aimed at fighting for democracy and opposing revanchism and militarism, was held in Frankfurt am Main on the 23rd and 24th. Approximately 350 representatives from West German youth organizations such as the West German Socialist Student League, the "Falcon Troop," "Friends of Nature," and the "Young Socialists" participated in this congress. About 100 guests from Britain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and the German Democratic Republic also attended.

    Participants in the congress issued a joint statement from British, West German, and West Berlin student organizations to the Geneva foreign ministers. The statement expressed opposition to the deployment of nuclear weapons on German territory and advocated for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two Germanys.

    The congress also passed a resolution demanding that the West German government immediately cease its arms expansion, immediately ban and eliminate all weapons of mass destruction, abolish universal conscription, expel the old officer corps from the Federal Armed Forces, immediately ban all old veterans' associations, immediately negotiate a peace treaty with Germany that includes these demands, negotiate between the two German governments on the gradual rapprochement of the two Germanys, and have the West German government abandon its attempts to revise existing German borders and recognize the Oder-Neisse line.

    Another resolution passed by the congress called for the purge of Nazi officials and anti-democratic elements from the West German government and judiciary, as well as democratic supervision of these institutions. The resolution also demanded the release of all patriots imprisoned for opposing the Adenauer regime's atomic war preparations.

    Schüller, the first chairman of the Socialist Student League, delivered a report at the congress. He pointed out that West Germany has become an active executor of the "Cold War," and that West Germany is employing war criminals in key positions in state organs. West Germany has recently particularly strengthened revanchist propaganda. This clearly shows that German fascism is reviving. This is a threat to world peace.

    British Labour MP Zilliacus, West German Social Democratic MP Bölling, and renowned West German pastor Mochalski also spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the revival of militarism and the revival of reactionary forces in West Germany pose a great danger to the people. The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League wrote a letter to the congress, guaranteeing that it would do its utmost to support the West German youth in their struggle against reactionaries and for peace and democracy.

    新华社柏林25日电  由西德社会主义者学生联盟发起的争取民主、反对复仇主义和军国主义的青年代表大会23日和24日在美因河畔法兰克福举行。参加这次代表大会的有西德社会主义者学生联盟和“鹰团”、“自然之友”以及“青年社会党人”等西德青年组织的代表约三百五十人。出席这次大会的还有来自英国、意大利、瑞典、丹麦和德意志民主共和国的约一百名来宾。
    参加这次大会的人发表了一项英国、西德和西柏林的学生组织给日内瓦外长们的共同声明。这项声明表示反对在德国领土上设置核武器，主张两个德国建立外交关系。
    大会还通过了一项决议，要求西德政府立即停止扩军、立即禁止和消除一切大规模毁灭性武器，取消普遍兵役制、把旧军官团从联邦国防军中赶出去和立即禁止所有的旧军人联合会、立即进行包括了这些要求在内的对德和约的谈判，在两个德国政府之间就两个德国逐步接近的问题进行谈判、西德政府就两个德国放弃修改现有的德国疆界的企图并承认奥得——尼斯河线。
    大会通过的另一项决议要求肃清西德政府和司法机构中的纳粹官吏和反民主分子以及对这些机构进行民主监督。决议还要求释放所有由于反对阿登纳政权的原子战争准备而被关进监狱的爱国人士。
    社会主义者学生联盟第一主席许勒在大会上作了报告。他指出，西德已经成为“冷战”的积极执行者，西德正在起用战犯在国家机关中担任要职。西德最近特别加强了复仇主义宣传。这明显地表明，德国法西斯主义正在复活。这是对世界和平的威胁。
    英国工党议员齐里亚库斯、西德社会民主党议员贝里希和西德著名牧师莫哈尔斯基等人也在会上发了言，他们指出，复活军国主义和复活西德的反动势力给人民带来了巨大的危险。自由德国青年联盟中央委员会给这个代表大会写了一封信，保证将尽力支持西德青年反对反动派、争取和平与民主的斗争。
