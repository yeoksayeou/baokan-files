I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and other reports. At the same time, I fully agree with the stern denunciation by the members of the crimes of the former Tibet local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to betray the motherland, and the righteous condemnation of the despicable schemes of the Indian expansionists. I feel extremely angry as well! Now, I would like to express some opinions on the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture.

The "Eight-Character Constitution" was proposed by Chairman Mao, summarizing the experiences of the peasants in increasing production. The practice of 1958 proved that wherever this "Constitution" was conscientiously implemented, the increase in agricultural production was relatively large; wherever this "Constitution" was poorly implemented, the increase was small or non-existent. Therefore, conscientiously implementing the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" is a fundamental experience in the great leap forward of agricultural production in 1958.

Every word of the "Eight-Character Constitution" can increase production, and every word has its unique role. However, the measures in the eight characters are interconnected and interdependent. If they are used in isolation, their production-increasing effect will not be great, and it will also limit the application of other measures. For example, as everyone knows, manure and diligent watering can increase production. However, without deep plowing, the manure and water cannot be absorbed. If there is sufficient manure and water, but there are no corresponding high-quality varieties and a series of technical management measures to cooperate, the role of water and fertilizer cannot be fully utilized to achieve a high level of production increase. At the same time, if there is too much water but not enough manure, the crops will be yellow and thin; if there is too much manure but not enough water, the crops will wither. On the other hand, each word of the "Eight-Character Constitution" itself must be used appropriately. For example, after water conservancy was implemented in Xiangyuan Township People's Commune in Qin County, Shanxi Province in 1958, the Dahuangzhuang Production Team of the commune, due to lack of experience and improper use of water, had an average corn yield of only over 260 jin, while the experienced Xiwangqiao Production Team, due to mastering the irrigation technology of timely and appropriate watering, achieved an average corn yield of 940 jin. Their experience is "Do not water if the soil is dry to three fingers deep. Water small seedlings when dry, water large seedlings constantly, and keep watering during tasseling and flowering." Therefore, the deeper the understanding of the "Eight-Character Constitution," the better the connection, and the more skillfully it is used, the greater the production increase effect.

During my inspection in Qin County, Shanxi, I felt that they had done a relatively comprehensive and detailed job in implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution." Qin County reaped a comprehensive bumper harvest last year due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," with the total grain output increasing by 66% compared to 1957. However, they themselves examined that there were still shortcomings in the comprehensive and specific implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution," such as superficiality, crudeness, and the failure to well combine scientific technology with the experience of old farmers and local conditions, resulting in the various production-increasing factors not being fully utilized. This year, the county plans to achieve a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu and a total output of 847 million jin, more than doubling that of 1958. To complete this grand target, it is necessary to implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" more comprehensively and to make the "Eight-Character Constitution" specific, localized, and popularized, so that each word of the Constitution yields more grain.

According to this spirit, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the method of "inviting in" (inviting old farmers, production team leaders, and scientific and technical cadres to hold discussions) was adopted to systematically summarize the successful experiences and lessons learned in implementing the agricultural production increase "Eight-Character Constitution" in 1958, analyze the local natural conditions and cultivation conditions, and, based on the principle of grasping both local methods and modern methods and combining scientific principles with the experience of old farmers, re-specified and localized the "Eight-Character Constitution." They formulated the "Qin County Crop Cultivation Early Knowledge for the Year," which explained in detail how to specifically apply the eight characters of water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management in the growth process of various crops (various knowledge tables were formulated separately). According to the characteristics of each word of the agricultural production increase "Constitution" and the needs of crop growth, each word was further specified, and "small eight characters" were formulated. For example: In terms of the water character, based on how much water should be given to crops, when to water, how much to water, and how to water, the following seven characters were formulated: use (water), connect (canals, ditches), level (land), conserve (store cold water), good (use well), timely (appropriate time), amount (appropriate amount). In terms of the fertilizer character, based on crops wanting to eat when they want to eat, having as much as they want, and having what they want, the following ten characters were formulated: open up (fertilizer sources), create (fertilizer), manage (conserve fertilizer), deliver (deliver fertilizer), due to (due to land, due to time), divide (apply in layers and batches), mix (apply mixed fertilizer), concentrate (concentrated application), amount (sufficient amount), quality (good quality).

Other characters such as soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management were also formulated with six, seven, three or four characters respectively. In short, more specific measures were formulated for each character. They called this "eight characters in eight characters, each character finding measures, one link interlocking another, each link digging potential."

After the "Qin County Crop Cultivation Early Knowledge for the Year" was compiled, it played a great role in guiding agricultural production in 1959. However, due to the rich content, although relatively simple methods were used in the compilation, it was still felt to be somewhat cumbersome. The "Eight-Character Constitution" is to be implemented by various production units and the masses who actually operate, so it is necessary to make it easy for the masses to accept, everyone can understand, and everyone can use it to truly exert its effect. Therefore, the "Qin County Agricultural Almanac for a Thousand Jin per Mu in 1959" was formulated on the basis of the "Qin County Crop Cultivation Early Knowledge for the Year" in the manner of an "almanac." Focusing on the characteristics and requirements of the twelve months and twenty-four solar terms throughout the year, as well as the laws of crop growth and development, the central tasks of each period were clearly stipulated. The specific arrangements are: In January, sow the seed; in February, fertilizer takes command; in March, soil is the key; in April, density comes first; in May, protect the seedlings; in June, harvesting is important; in July, management takes over; in August, fertilizer is promoted; in September, rush to harvest and sow; in October, soil is the key; in November, water and fertilizer are put into action; and in December, tool reform takes the lead.

While stipulating the central tasks of each season, it also clarified the central links of each character that should be grasped and the other measures to be combined, grasping each central link to drive the comprehensive implementation of other measures. For example: Under the center of fertilizer taking command in February, it is proposed: "Actively transporting fertilizer is the center, repairing and preparing agricultural tools should be grasped tightly, exchanging, turning and drying to prepare high-quality seeds, vigorously carrying out medicine and machinery to eliminate diseases and insect pests, and comprehensively preparing for farming." At the same time, it also puts forward the quality, standards, time, specific measures, and precautions for completing various tasks in each season.

In order to comprehensively and thoroughly implement the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" and to revise and supplement the already formulated agricultural "almanac" in a timely manner, they adopted the working method of "sending out." The county party secretary took the lead by characters, contracted and was responsible; professional institutions for the "Eight-Character Constitution" were established from the county to the management area, and a professional team of 2,576 people including cadres, technicians, old farmers, and the masses was organized to engage in the research and guidance of the "Eight-Character" technology, studying, experimenting, guiding, and promoting simultaneously. On-site meetings were held for each character, and key points were set up for each character experiment. The county party committee had key points for each item, and each commune and management area had typical examples, creating models, on-site teaching, training cadres, and comprehensively promoting.

After this agricultural "almanac" was formulated and promoted, it greatly enhanced the authority of the "Eight-Character Constitution" and exerted the effectiveness of the "Eight-Character Constitution." It specifically reflected the scientific nature of the "Eight-Character Constitution" and further enhanced the confidence of the broad cadres and masses in achieving a thousand jin per mu this year. It helped grassroots cadres improve their working methods, clarified the central tasks and overall work of each season, month, and solar term, so that they were clear in their minds, arranged early, and proceeded in an orderly manner. At the same time, it also opened the door of science for all cadres and the broad masses. Therefore, it was warmly welcomed by the broad cadres and masses of the county, who unanimously praised: "The Eight-Character Constitution is a treasure, the agricultural almanac is well-written, every measure is detailed and ingenious, and a thousand jin per mu is still too little."

At present, Qin County is vigorously publicizing and implementing this specific "Eight-Character Constitution" by season and stage. I believe and wish them success in blooming flowers and reaping fruits.

In his Government Work Report, Premier Zhou pointed out regarding the measures of the "Eight-Character Constitution": "...Different measures should be adopted to suit different natural conditions and different crops, and should not be the same in every case; various measures are interconnected and interdependent, and it is not enough to only take one or several measures. We must sum up these experiences well, so that each commune and each production team can determine various appropriate production increase technical measures according to their specific conditions and conscientiously implement them." I think this instruction is very important, so I have briefly introduced Qin County's experience, hoping that other regions will use it as a reference and also specify, localize, and popularize the agricultural production increase "Eight-Character Constitution," so that the "Eight-Character Constitution" can truly take root and be further improved and developed, ensuring the victorious and over-fulfilled completion of the agricultural production task in 1959.

　　更细更巧地运用农业“八字宪法”
    刘定安委员就在山西沁县视察所见谈农业“八字宪法”如何进一步具体化、地方化、群众化
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和其它各项报告。同时，我也完全同意各位委员对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮背叛祖国罪行的严正申讨，和对于印度扩张主义分子卑鄙阴谋的正义责斥。我同样感到十分愤怒！现在，我就农业“八字宪法”发表一点意见。
    “八字宪法”是毛主席总结了农民群众增产措施的经验而提出的。一九五八年的实践证明：哪里认真贯彻执行这个“宪法”，哪里的农业生产增长幅度就比较大，哪里贯彻执行这个“宪法”比较差，哪里的增产比例就小，或者没有增产。因此，认真执行农业“八字宪法”是一九五八年农业生产大跃进增产措施方面的一条根本经验。
    “八字宪法”的每一个字都能增产，每一个字都有它的独特作用。但是，八字的措施，又是互相关连、互相依靠的，如果孤立地运用，它的增产作用就不大，而且也会限制了其他措施的运用。比如大家知道的，粪大、水勤，能够增产，但是，不深耕，粪和水就吃不进去；粪大水足了，而没有相适应的优良品种和一系列的技术管理相配合，也不能充分发挥水、肥的作用，达到高度增产效果。同时，水大了，粪不足，庄稼就会黄瘦，粪大了，水不足，庄稼又会干枯。另一方面“八字宪法”每个字的本身又必须恰当地运用，如山西省沁县襄垣镇人民公社一九五八年水利化以后，该社大黄庄生产队由于缺乏经验，用水不当，玉米产量平均只有二百六十多斤，而有经验的西王桥生产队，由于掌握了适时适量的灌溉技术，玉米平均产量达到九百四十斤，他们的经验是“三指土不干，不用浇水灌，小苗干、大苗灌，秀穗开花水不断”。因此对“八字宪法”理解得愈深，联系得愈好，运用的愈巧，增产效果也就愈大。
    这次我到山西沁县视察，感到他们对“八字宪法”的贯彻执行做得比较全面细致。沁县去年由于认真贯彻执行了“八字宪法”获得了全面大丰收，粮食总产量比一九五七年提高百分之六十六；但是，他们自己检查，在全面的具体的执行“八字宪法”上还存在着浮浅、粗糙、科学技术与老农经验和当地情况没有很好结合的缺点，致使各种增产因素还没有得到充分的发挥。今年该县计划每亩粮食产量要达到一千斤，总产量要达到八点四七亿斤，比一九五八年翻一番半还多，要完成这个宏伟的指标，就需要使“八字宪法”更全面地贯彻，使“八字宪法”具体化、地方化、群众化，让宪法八个字，字字多出粮食。
    根据这个精神，在党委的领导下，采取了“请进来”（把老农、生产队长、科学技术干部请来座谈）的方式，系统地总结了一九五八年执行农业增产“八字宪法”的成功经验和失败教训，分析了当地自然条件，耕作条件，根据一手抓土，一手抓洋，科学原理和老农经验相结合的原则，把“八字宪法”再具体化，地方化，制定了“沁县农作物一年栽培早知道”，分别将水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管这八个字在各项作物生育过程中如何具体运用，作了比较详细的说明（分别订定各项须知表）；并根据农业增产“宪法”八个字每字的特点和作物生长的需要，将每个字进一步具体化，订出了“小八字”。如：水字方面，根据应给庄稼多少水？什么时候浇，浇多少？如何浇等，订出：用（水）、通（渠、沟）、平（地）、养（将冷水储蓄）、好（用好）、时（适时）、量（适量）七个字。肥字方面，根据庄稼甚时想吃甚时有，想吃多少有多少，想吃什么有什么，订出：开（开辟肥源）、造（造肥）、管（保肥）、送（送肥）、因（因地、因时）、分（分层分次施）、混（混合施）、集（集中施）、量（足量）、质（质好）十个字。
    其他土、种、密、保、工、管几字也都分别订出有六字的、七字的，也有三字或四字的。总之，把每个字都订出了更具体的措施。他们把这叫做“八字套八字，字字找措施，一环扣一环，环环挖潜力”。
    “沁具农作物一年栽培早知道”编成后，对指导一九五九年的农业生产起了很大的作用。但是由于内容丰富，虽然在编订中尽量采用了比较简单的方式，仍然觉得有些繁多，而
  “八字宪法”是要各个生产单位和实际操作的群众来执行，就需要使群众容易接受，人人能懂、个个会用，才能真正发挥其效果。因此，又在“沁县农作物一年栽培早知道”的基础上再群众化，按照“历书”的方式，制订了“沁县一九五九年亩产千斤农事皇历”，围绕全年十二个月、二十四个节令的特点和要求，以及农作物的生长发育规律，明确地规定了每个时期的中心工作，具体安排是：一月种上阵，二月肥挂帅，三月土为纲，四月密当先，五月保苗成，六月收为重，七月管掌印，八月肥升帐，九月闹收种，十月土为纲，十一月水肥上阵，十二月工改先行。
    在规定各个季节中心工作的同时，还明确了应抓的每个字的中心环节和结合的其他措施，抓住每个中心环节带动其他各项措施的全面贯彻。例如：在二月肥挂帅的中心下，提出：“积极运肥是中心，修置农具要抓紧，调换、翻晒备优种，大搞药械灭病虫，全面备耕齐奔腾”。同时也提出了各个季节应完成各项工作的质量、标准、时间，具体措施和注意事项。
    为了全面彻底贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，使已制订的农业“皇历”及时修正补充，他们又采取“派出去”的工作方法，县委书记分字挂帅，包干负责；从县到管理区建立“八字宪法”专业机构，组织干部、技术员、老农、群众共二千五百七十六人的专业队伍，从事“八字”技术的研究，指导工作，边研究，边实验，边指导，边推广；字字召开现场会，字字试验搞重点，县委项项有重点，公社、管理区个个有典型，搞出样子，现场教学，训练干部，全面推广。
    这个农事“皇历”制订推广后，大大地提高了“八字宪法”的威信，发挥了“八字宪法”的效力，具体体现了“八字宪法”的科学性，进一步增强了广大干部和群众实现今年亩产千斤的信心。帮助基层干部改进了工作方法，明确了各季、各月、各节令的中心任务和全面工作，做到心中有数，及早安排、有条不紊。同时，也为全体干部和广大群众打开了科学之门。因而受到全县广大干部和群众的热烈欢迎，一致赞扬：“八字宪法是个宝，农事皇历订得好，样样措施细又巧，亩产千斤还嫌少。”
    目前沁县正在分季、分段大力宣传贯彻这个具体化的“八字宪法”，我相信也预祝他们会盛开鲜花获得硕果。
    周总理在政府工作报告中对“八字宪法”措施指出：“……适应于不同的自然条件和不同的作物，应当采取不同的措施，而不应当千篇一律；各种措施又是互相关连互相依靠的，不能够满足于仅仅采取某一种或某几种措施。我们必须很好地总结这些经验，使各个公社、各个生产队根据自己的具体条件，确定各种适当的增产技术措施，认真执行。”我觉得这个指示十分重要，所以将沁县的经验特作简要介绍，希望其他地区作为参考，也能把农业增产“八字宪法”具体化、地方化、群众化，使“八字宪法”踏踏实实扎下根，并得到进一步的提高和发展，保证一九五九年农业生产任务的胜利和超额完成。
