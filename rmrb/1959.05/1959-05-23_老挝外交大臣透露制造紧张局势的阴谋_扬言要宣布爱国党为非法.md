Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya, who is currently active in South Vietnam, openly declared yesterday in an exclusive interview with an Associated Press reporter that the Royal Lao Government is considering formally declaring the Lao Patriotic Party illegal in the near future. He threatened, "The Royal Government is determined to eliminate them if they refuse to surrender."

Panya also said that the nine most important leaders of the Lao Patriotic Party, including Prince Souphanouvong, are now under house arrest.

Panya's above remarks confirm that the Lao authorities' current armed persecution of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units is merely part of its conspiracy to launch a full-scale attack on the Lao Patriotic Party, incite civil war in Laos, and create tensions in Indochina.

The Lao Patriotic Party was established in November 1957, and its predecessor was the Lao Patriotic Front. According to the joint communique signed on December 28, 1956, by former Lao Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma and former Pathet Lao Fighting Units leader Prince Souphanouvong, and the joint statement issued on November 2, 1957, after the establishment of a coalition government with representatives from the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, the Lao Patriotic Front (later renamed the Patriotic Party) became a political organization, enjoying the same rights and bearing the same obligations as other legally established political parties. The Lao Royal Government, at the instigation of the United States, is attempting to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the Lao Patriotic Party. This action not only violates the Geneva Accords on Laos but is also a blatant violation of the aforementioned agreement between the two Lao sides.

    老挝外交大臣透露制造紧张局势的阴谋
    扬言要宣布爱国党为非法
    新华社河内22日电　正在南越进行活动的老挝外交大臣坎番·班雅昨天在单独接见美联社记者时公然宣称，老挝王国政府正在考虑在最近的将来正式宣布老挝爱国党为非法的问题。他威胁说，“王国政府决定消灭他们，如果他们拒绝投降的话。”
    班雅还说，老挝爱国党的九位最重要的领袖，包括苏发努冯亲王在内，现在已经被软禁起来。　　班雅的上述谈话证实，老挝当局目前对前寮国战斗部队发动的武装迫害，不过是它对老挝爱国党发动全面进攻，在老挝发动内战并制造印度支那紧张局势的阴谋的一部分。
    老挝爱国党是在1957年11月成立的，它的前身是老挝爱国战线。根据前老挝王国首相富马亲王和前寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王在1956年12月28日签订的联合公报和1957年11月2日发表的联合声明，在有寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府成立以后，老挝爱国战线（后改名为爱国党）便成为一个政治性的组织，同依法建立的其他政党一样，享有同样的权利和负有同等的义务。老挝王国政府在美国唆使下，企图消灭前寮国战斗部队和老挝爱国党的行动，不仅违反有关老挝问题的日内瓦协议，而且也是公然破坏上述老挝双方之间的协议的行动。
