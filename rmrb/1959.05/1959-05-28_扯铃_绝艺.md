    "Diabolo" Masterpiece
    As the old artist Tian Shuangliang tightened the rope in his hand, the single-headed diabolo, spinning on the diabolo rope, suddenly soared into the sky several feet away. In an instant, this diabolo, emitting a melodious and pleasant lark whistle, returned from the high altitude precisely onto the diabolo rope, and was exactly clasped onto the half-inch-long shaft at the end of the diabolo, where it continued to spin. The audience couldn't help but admire the old man's superb skill. This old man is Tian Shuangliang, an actor from the Shanghai People's Acrobatic Troupe who is over sixty years old, and who recently performed in the first Shanghai Puppet and Acrobatic Performance.
    Tian Shuangliang lost his parents at a young age and learned the "diabolo" masterpiece entirely on his own. From the age of twelve or thirteen, he wandered around dozens of countries in China, Europe, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Unable to endure the cruel exploitation and oppression of the capitalists, the old man painfully stopped performing his two diabolo programs: the wine gourd and the single-headed diabolo. After this old artist returned to China in 1952 and joined the Shanghai People's Acrobatic Troupe, he re-practiced these two programs that had been suspended for a long time. Finally, in this puppet and acrobatic performance, which was the first time he had ever participated in one, he met with the audience.
    Over the past few years, the apprentices diligently cultivated by Tian Shuangliang have spread throughout acrobatic troupes in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Dalian, and other places.

    “扯铃”绝艺
    老艺人田双亮把手里的绳子一拉紧，那只飞旋着在扯铃绳上的单头铃“半个空竹”猛然钻入几丈远的高空，弹指间这只发出悠扬悦耳的鸰哨声的铃儿又从高空不偏不倚地回到扯铃绳上面，而且恰好扣在铃端长不过半寸的轴上旋转。全场观众不禁为老人的演技赞叹不已。这个老人就是最近在上海首次举行的木偶、杂技会演中，年逾六旬的上海人民杂技团演员田双亮。
    田双亮自幼失去双亲，完全靠自学练得一身“扯铃”绝艺。他从十二、三岁起就在国内和欧洲、澳洲、南洋等地数十个国家颠沛流离，由于不堪忍受资本家的残酷剥削和压榨，那时老人痛心地把酒葫芦和单头铃两个扯铃节目停演了。这位老艺人从1952年回国参加上海人民杂技团后，才重新练习这两个停演已久的节目，终于在这次他一生中第一次参加的木偶、杂技会演中与广大观众见面。
    几年来，田双亮辛勤培育出来的徒弟已遍布北京、重庆、广州、武汉、旅大等地杂技团。
