Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Various regions across the country are vigorously developing the production of medicinal herbs. According to statistics from twenty-one provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, by the end of April, the country had planted more than 2.8 million mu of various medicinal herbs, an increase of more than 800,000 mu compared to the actual planting area in 1958. The sowing work is still continuing.

This year, all regions have paid close attention to the development of medicinal herb production. Many places have adopted the method of "large-scale movements combined with small-scale movements." For medicinal herbs that are produced year-round, small-scale efforts are made during the busy farming season, and large-scale efforts are made during the slack season. For medicinal herbs that are produced seasonally, the masses are organized for intensive harvesting. Cili County in Hunan Province established nineteen medicinal herb farms, achieving "every commune has a farm." In Qixia County, Shandong Province, offices or committees for medicinal herb production were established at the county, township, and commune levels, operated by specialized teams, and more than 200 people planted experimental plots.

In Shandong, Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan and other provinces, county Party secretaries and county heads personally took charge, establishing management organizations for medicinal herb production.

In terms of varieties, in addition to expanding the production of "authentic medicinal herbs" (i.e., the main medicinal herb varieties originally supplied by the local area to the whole country), various regions actively introduced and trial-planted wild and foreign medicinal herbs in accordance with the principle of "local production, local supply" and "transforming wild medicinal herbs into domestic cultivation and breeding." In 1958, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region cultivated only three types of medicinal herbs: Tianqi, Wu Yu, and Cassia. This year, the number has increased to more than two hundred. Sichuan Province has trial-planted more than sixty kinds of wild medicinal herbs and established musk deer farms, turning wild musk deer into domestic musk deer. The method of extracting musk from live musk deer has also achieved preliminary success.

In order to solve the technical problems of medicinal herb production, various regions have sent people to old medicinal herb areas to learn production techniques or invited experienced medicinal herb farmers from old medicinal herb areas to provide technical guidance. Some regions have also held training courses or traditional Chinese medicine secondary schools to cultivate technical talents for medicinal herb production.

Commercial and health departments in many places have signed medicinal herb production and procurement contracts with the people's communes in medicinal herb producing areas, and have issued advance payments and loans to support medicinal herb production. (Attached picture)

### 野生变为家种  突击结合经常  各地种药材二百八十多万亩

    野生变为家种  突击结合经常
    各地种药材二百八十多万亩
    据新华社25日讯  全国各地大力发展药材生产。据二十一个省、市、自治区统计，到4月底，全国已经种植各种药材二百八十多万亩，比1958年实际种植面积增加了八十多万亩。目前播种工作还在继续进行中。
    今年各地对发展药材生产都抓得比较紧。许多地方采取了大运动套小运动的办法，对常年生产的药材，农忙小搞，农闲大搞；季节性生产的药材，组织群众突击采集。湖南省慈利县成立了十九个药场，实现了社社有场。山东栖霞县、乡、社都成立了药材生产办公室或委员会，由专业队伍专门经营，并有二百多人种了试验田。
    山东、湖南、云南、四川等省不少药材产区的县委书记、县长都亲自挂帅，成立了药材生产管理机构。
    在品种方面，各地除了扩大地道药材（即原来当地供应全国各地的主要药材品种）的生产以外，还根据“就地生产，就地供应”和“变野生药材为家种家养”的方针，积极引种和试种野生和外地药材。广西僮族自治区1958年栽培的药材只有田七、吴芋、桂类三种，今年增加到二百多种。四川省试种了野生药材六十多种，并建立了麝鹿饲养场，使野獐变家獐，从活獐身上取麝香的方法也获得初步成效。
    为解决药材生产的技术问题，各地都派人到老药区学习生产技术或请老药区药农来进行技术指导。有些地区还举办了训练班或中药中学，培养药材生产的技术人才。
    许多地方的商业和卫生部门与药材产区的人民公社签订了药材生产、收购合同，并发放了预购金和贷款，扶植药材生产。（附图片）
