    Clock and Watch Stethoscope
    The Tianjin Hengdeli Clock and Watch Store recently created an "Electronic Watch Tester." When customers bring watches in for repair, they don't need to open the mechanism. They simply place the "problematic" watch on this instrument, turn on the power, and they can hear the location of the watch's problem from the two rubber listening tubes. This both improves work efficiency and makes things easier for customers. The youth group in this store has also used discarded parts to make approximately two hundred large and small innovative tools. (Wang Shouheng)

    钟表听诊器
    天津市亨得利钟表店新近制出一种“电子检表仪”。顾客们将表送来修理时，不用打开机器，只要将有“毛病”的表，放在这个仪器上，开动电门，从两个胶皮听管中，就能听出表的毛病所在。这既提高了工作效率，也便利了顾客。这个门市部的青年小组目前还利用废旧零件制成大小革新工具约二百项。（王守衡）
