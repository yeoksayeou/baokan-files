Two Folk Songs

    Happy Wheat Harvest
    Xiong Da
    Thousands of miles of wheat waves greet the wind with laughter, laughter drowning the Xiangyang road,
    Villages and trees are half-hidden, with scattered green hills like islands.
    The breeze is gentle, the waves surge, and the laughter is even higher than Mount Wudang.
    I wish to stand on the summit of Mount Wudang and shout, "The people's commune is good!"
    Repair Farm Tools, Train Well
    Zhang Qianju
    People shout, horses neigh, the earth shakes, lights shine bright before and behind the mountains;
    Repair farm tools, train well, and show heroism on the summer harvest front.

    民歌二首
    喜小麦丰收
    熊达
    千里麦浪迎风笑，笑声淹没襄阳道，
    村庄树木半遮掩，点点青山如海岛。
    风袅袅，浪滔滔，笑声更比武当高。
    愿立武当山顶上，高呼“人民公社好”。
    修好农具练好兵
    张千驹
    人喊马叫天地动，山前山后灯火明；
    修好农具练好兵，夏收战线逞英雄。
