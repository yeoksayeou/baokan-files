Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 17th: The Daye Iron Mine has mobilized the masses to vigorously improve the quality of iron ore, supplying Wuhan Iron and Steel with high-quality ore to meet its ironmaking needs. From May 1st to 13th, the iron content of the ore supplied by this mine to Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace was above 50%, and the sulfur content was 0.02%, meeting the prescribed standards. While ensuring quality, it overfulfilled the task of supplying ore in the first ten days of May by 60%.

The beneficiation section of the Daye Iron Mine's concentrator has not yet been completed. Without beneficiation equipment to process the ore, it is difficult to improve the quality of the ore. Based on this situation, the mine's Party committee, on the basis of mobilizing the masses, has taken a series of technical measures to strengthen quality management. In mining, they have improved the ore sampling and testing system, compiled ore grade distribution maps based on accurate geological data, strictly implemented the ore separation system, and prevented waste rock from going down the mountain with the ore. The ore from the mine's Shizishan mining area has a high iron and sulfur content, while the ore from the Jianshan mining area has a lower iron and sulfur content. They have adopted the method of mixing the ore from the two locations to solve the problems of low iron and high sulfur. Relevant departments have also strengthened quality analysis and inspection, and publish the quality completion status to the workers every day, which has also played a role in improving the quality of the ore.

    决不让废石随矿下山
    大冶用好矿石供应武钢
    新华社武汉17日电　大冶铁矿发动群众大力提高铁矿石质量，以优质矿石供应武钢炼铁需要。5月1日至13日，这个矿供应武钢一号高炉的矿石含铁量都在50％以上，含硫0.02％，达到了规定指标；在保证质量的前提下，超额60％完成了5月上旬供应矿石的任务。
    大冶铁矿选矿厂的精选部分，现在还没有建成。没有精选设备来选矿，要提高矿石质量就有不少困难。矿的党委根据这一情况，在发动群众的基础上，采取了一系列的技术措施，来加强质量管理。在采矿方面健全了矿石取样化验制度，根据精确的地质资料编制矿石品级分布图，严格执行矿石分采制度，不让废石随矿下山。这个矿的狮子山矿场的矿石含铁含硫高，尖山矿场的矿石含铁含硫较低，他们就采取将两地矿石混合配矿的作法，解决了铁低和硫高的问题。有关部门还加强了质量分析检查，每天向职工公布质量完成情况，对提高矿石质量也起了作用。
