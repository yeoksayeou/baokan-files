　　Rich and Diverse Sichuan Chinese Medicinal Herbs

　　Sichuan Province is one of the major bases for the production of Chinese medicinal herbs in our country. It boasts large yields and many varieties of medicinal materials. In 1958, the total harvest of wild-collected and cultivated medicinal materials in the province was approximately 1.45 million dan, with about 1,300 varieties, accounting for about one-third of the total national output of medicinal materials.

　　From the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in western Sichuan to the Daba Mountains in the east, from the Minshan Mountains in the north to the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains in the south, medicinal material production areas are distributed in more than 180 counties. Alpine and cold mountainous areas and ethnic minority regions are rich in fritillary bulbs, musk, and deer antlers. The Coptis chinensis (huanglian) and Gastrodia elata (tianma) of Mount Emei, the Ligusticum chuanxiong (chuanxiong) of Guanxian County, the Ophiopogon japonicus (maidong) of Mianyang, the Aconitum carmichaelii (fuzi) of Jiangzhang, and the Paeonia lactiflora (baishao) of Quxian County are all famous at home and abroad. Last year, the output of twenty-one kinds of precious medicinal materials, such as Ophiopogon japonicus, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Paeonia lactiflora, rhubarb, and fritillary bulbs, generally accounted for 70%-80% of the national total.

　　Wild animals and plants are one of the main sources of Chinese medicinal materials in Sichuan, with their annual output accounting for more than 80% of the province's total output of medicinal materials. Each year, local Party committees mobilize the masses to traverse the deep mountains and old forests, collect wild medicines in barren mountains and wild lands, capture wild animals, and search for and investigate wild medicinal material resources. In addition to collecting medicinal materials to meet market needs, abundant new varieties have been discovered since last year. In the Xichang Special District and the three ethnic autonomous prefectures of Ganzi, Aba, and Liangshan, Codonopsis pilosula (dangshen) and Aucklandia lappa (muxiang) were discovered. Almost every county in Xichang Special District has a large amount of precious medicinal materials such as Codonopsis pilosula, rhubarb, fritillary bulbs, musk, and bear bile. It is estimated that the reserves of Codonopsis pilosula are about 500,000 dan, rhubarb 200,000 dan, and wild Paeonia lactiflora, which can replace cultivated Paeonia lactiflora, 1 million dan. More than 1,000 kinds of medicinal materials have been discovered in the Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas, and the reserves are also very abundant.

　　Large-scale cultivation is another important feature of Sichuan Province's development of Chinese medicinal material production. This year, the planned planting area in the province has increased from 200,000 mu last year to 1.2 million mu, with 63 varieties. According to statistics on only 22 of these varieties, the annual output can reach 1.4 million dan. In addition to continuing to produce the original varieties, wild Gastrodia elata, fritillary bulbs, and Pinellia ternata (banxia) and other commonly used medicinal materials have been domesticated, and Rehmannia glutinosa (shengdi), ginseng, Atractylodes macrocephala (baizhu), Tussilago farfara (donghua), and Panax notoginseng (sanqi) from other regions have been introduced to Sichuan. The province's approach to developing the cultivation of medicinal materials is to consolidate and expand old bases and actively open up new production areas. In addition to the general development in various regions, emphasis is placed on the original areas with better natural conditions and higher medicinal material output, such as Emei, Wushan, Dazu, Nanchuan, and Guanxian, to gradually establish a batch of production bases, and to incorporate medicinal material production into agricultural production plans. In terms of animal medicinal materials, a man-made musk deer farm has been established in the Maerkang area of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and wild musk deer and deer have been successfully raised. In the past, musk could only be extracted once from a captured musk deer, and antlers could only be taken once from a deer, but now it is possible to take them once a year.

　　In order to improve the production technology of cultivated medicinal materials, increase the yield per unit area, and shorten the harvest years of medicinal materials, the province's health, commercial, and other relevant departments and scientific research institutions have organized forces to assist people's communes in summarizing the experiences of medicinal farmers, running training courses, and carrying out scientific research work. The Institute of Chinese Medicine and Materia Medica of the Sichuan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has expanded the planting area of the drug experimental planting farm opened in Nanchuan County to 10,000 mu this year, and has currently planted 700 to 800 kinds of medicinal plants; it has also made many important achievements in domestication of wild medicinal materials, introduction of medicinal materials from other places, shortening the harvest years, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Emei County, which is rich in medicinal materials, also opened a Chinese medicine middle school on Mount Emei last year, specializing in training technical cadres for Chinese medicine production.

　　丰富多彩的四川中药材
    四川省是我国中药材生产的主要基地之一。药材的产量大，品种多。1958年全省采集野生药材和种植药材总收获量约一百四十五万担，品种有一千三百种左右，约占全国药材总产量的三分之一。
    四川从西部的甘孜藏族自治州到东部的大巴山，北起岷山山脉，南到大小凉山，药材产区分布有一百八十多个县。高寒山区和少数民族地区盛产贝母、麝香、鹿茸，峨眉山的黄连、天麻，灌县的川芎，绵阳的麦冬，江彰的附子，渠县的白芍等都驰名国内外。去年全省麦冬、川芎、白芍、大黄、贝母等二十一种名贵药材的产量，一般都占全国70％—80％。
    野生动、植物是四川中药材的主要来源之一，历年产量占全省中药材产量的80％以上。各地党委每年发动群众踏遍深山老林，向荒山野地采集野生药物，捕捉野兽，寻找和调查野生药材资源。除了采集药材供应市场需要外，去年以来又发现了蕴藏量十分丰富的新品种。西昌专区和甘孜、阿坝、凉山三个民族自治州，发现了党参、木香，西昌专区几乎每个县都有大量的党参、大黄、贝母、麝香、熊胆等名贵药材。据估计，党参蕴藏量约有五十万担，大黄二十万担，可代替家白芍用的野白芍一百万担。大小凉山地区调查发现药材品种在一千种以上，藏量也很丰富。
    大面积的种植，是四川省发展中药材生产的另一个重要特色。今年全省计划种植面积从去年的二十万亩增加到一百二十万亩，品种六十三种。仅据其中二十二种统计，年产量就可以达到一百四十万担。种植药材除了继续生产原有品种外，已将野生的天麻、贝母、半夏等常用药材变为家种，外区的生地、人参、白术、冬花、三七等引进四川。全省发展种植药材的办法是巩固扩大老基地，积极开辟新产区，除了各地普遍发展外，以原来自然条件较好、出产药材较多的峨眉、巫山、大足、南川、灌县等十几个产区为重点，逐步建立一批生产基地，并且把药材生产纳入农业生产计划。在动物药材方面，阿坝藏族自治州的马尔康地区已建立了一个人工养獐场，已把野生獐、鹿饲养成功，过去捕获一只獐只能取一次麝香，一只鹿取一次鹿角，现在可以做到每年取一次。
    为了改进种植药材生产技术，提高单位面积产量和缩短药材的收获年限，全省卫生、商业等各有关部门和科学研究机关，已组织力量协助人民公社总结药农经验，开办训练班，开展科学研究工作。中国科学院四川分院中医中药研究所，在南川县开辟的药物试验种植场，今年计划将种植面积扩大到一万亩，目前已种植七、八百种药用植物；并在野生药材变家种、引种外地药材、缩短收获年限、防治病虫害等方面，取得了许多重要成就。盛产药材的峨眉县，去年还在峨眉山开办了一所中药中学，专门培养中药生产技术干部。
