Sun Fuling's Speech

　　Chairman, fellow delegates, fellow committee members:

　　I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference reports, and express my firm determination to implement them.

　　Premier Zhou's report eloquently demonstrates that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country have been inspired with revolutionary vigor, and an unprecedented Great Leap Forward has emerged in 1958. This Great Leap Forward not only achieved significant developments in politics, economy, culture, and science in 1958, but more importantly, it provided an important foundation for future Great Leap Forwards. The development of the national economy in 1959 will be carried out on this basis with a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, further encouraging the courage and confidence of the people of the whole country to build a beautiful socialist and communist society.

　　In our country, all ethnic groups are engaged in selfless labor, building their beautiful homeland. However, a small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet openly undermine national unity, collude with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland. We are extremely indignant and firmly support the State Council's order to quell the rebellion in Tibet and disband the original Tibetan local government. With the strong assistance of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, the People's Liberation Army has basically quelled the rebellion. From now on, the Tibetan people will remove the mountain pressing down on their heads and, like other ethnic groups in the country, gradually undergo reforms and embark on the road to prosperity and happiness of socialism.

　　Religious Garb Cannot Conceal the True Form of Wolves

　　The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have consistently and resolutely implemented the policy of ethnic regional autonomy and freedom of religious belief for all ethnic groups. In the autumn and winter of 1956, I followed the Central Youth Delegation to Tibet to participate in the celebration of the Tibetan Youth Congress. Although we did not spend a long time in Tibet, we deeply felt the Party's great policy. Before entering Tibet, we began to learn about the customs and habits of the Tibetan people and respected some of the issues that should be noted in the religious beliefs of the Tibetan people. After arriving in Lhasa, we saw people all over the streets holding prayer wheels and chanting scriptures, and we often saw people worshiping Buddha in the Jokhang Temple. During our stay in Tibet, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China held a meeting, and the "Tibet Daily" published everyone's speeches, the content of which was related to religious scriptures and issues. Isn't this enough to show how the Central Government respects religious beliefs? On the contrary, those who truly destroy religion are the rebels who wave the banner of protecting religion and wear the cloak of religion. When we were in Tibet, we already knew that some monasteries were hiding weapons. Although I am not a religious believer, I believe that there is no such provision in Buddhist teachings. We wanted to visit Drepung Monastery and others in Lhasa, but in order to avoid some unexpected incidents caused by a few reactionary elements in the monastery, we abandoned our original plan. Later, when we arrived in Shigatse, we visited Tashilhunpo Monastery. The cadres of the Central Government stationed in Tibet and the troops of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet respected the Dalai Lama very much. All our activities there were carried out in accordance with the Party's policies, and we respected the Dalai Lama very much. Before we left Lhasa to visit other places in Tibet, we paid a special visit to the Dalai Lama and asked him to give us instructions on our work. On the contrary, let's see how the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet treated the Dalai Lama? On the day of the Tibetan Youth Congress, the Dalai Lama was originally scheduled to attend the conference and prepare to speak, but because of the obstruction of a few upper-class reactionary elements, he could not attend and participate. In the end, he could only meet with the Dalai Lama in the form of worshiping the Dalai Lama. Only ten minutes after the closing of the conference did all the representatives meet with the Dalai Lama. As for the situation mentioned by some representatives at this National People's Congress, such as poisoning Living Buddha Reting, poisoning Living Buddha Geda, and shelling the Sera Monastery, these are well known in Tibet. All this fully illustrates who truly protects and respects religion, and who are national traitors and religious traitors in religious disguise.

　　What Do Reactionary Elements Want to Maintain in Tibet?

　　During the Tang Dynasty, Princess Wencheng, a member of the Tang Dynasty Emperor Taizong's clan, married Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo. When she entered Tibet, she brought in many craftsmen and spread Han culture to Tibet, which is depicted in the murals of the Potala Palace. Tibetan culture has also been passed on to the interior through exchanges, and has been of great help to the people of all ethnic groups. However, until now, Tibet's social system is still the feudal serf system of more than a thousand years ago; the people still live in extreme poverty; the mode of production is very backward, and people can still be seen on the streets twisting wool ropes by hand; industry is fundamentally out of the question. It was not until after liberation that Lhasa had electric lights. Agricultural production is also extremely backward. However, a few nobles lived a luxurious and extravagant life, cruelly exploiting serfs. Serfs were not only unable to eat enough and dress warmly, but also had to provide their own means of transportation and even bring their own food when they went to work or perform corvée labor at the serf owner's home, and they could not even protect their own lives. From this, it can be seen that the reactionary rule of the past and imperialism brought infinite disasters and suffering to the Tibetan people. This small group of rebels and imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and Indian expansionists talk about "national autonomy," but in fact they want to maintain their illegal privileges and maintain such a backward and dark feudal serf system.

　　We clearly know that implementing ethnic autonomy is the Party's consistent policy. When we were in Tibet, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region had already been established. Ninety percent of the committee members and staff were Tibetan, and upper-level personnel were arranged for appropriate work positions such as committee members. However, these upper-level elements, in order to maintain their feudal serf exploitation system, refused to implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, obstructed the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, and repeatedly opposed reform, opposed the progress and development of the Tibetan ethnic group. Not only did they not reorganize the Tibetan army into the people's army, but they expanded the Tibetan army and deliberately rebelled. Back in 1956, the bandits in Xikang were directed by these reactionary upper-level elements in Lhasa. In Lhasa, we saw that the broad masses fully expressed their love for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army, and were very kind and enthusiastic to the Central Youth Delegation. But at the same time, we also saw the destructive activities of a few reactionary elements against the Party and the Central Government. One night, when we were having a party with the youth in Lhasa, the reactionary elements fired shots outside the venue to provoke us. As for the incidents of harming cadres entering Tibet, they were often heard. Even progressive figures among the upper-level elements in Tibet had to be constantly vigilant to avoid being poisoned by these reactionary elements. Logically speaking, these criminal activities of the reactionary elements should have been judged by the people long ago, but in order to promote their awakening, the Central Government repeatedly waited patiently and announced at the end of 1956 that reforms would not be carried out during the second five-year plan period. The broad masses of the people, including progressive upper and middle-level figures, warmly supported the democratic reforms. At the Youth Congress, some young laborers said: "You have to pay for land to grow crops, and you have to pay for water to drink," and urgently demanded immediate reforms. Even the upper-level youth expressed the unreasonableness of the serf system at the conference and actively supported the reforms. However, those reactionary elements stubbornly persisted to the end. They regarded the Central Government's peaceful consultation and patient waiting policy as weak and deceptive, and turned a blind eye to the legitimate demands of the broad masses of people, including upper-level progressive elements. On March 10, they openly rebelled, tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement, abducted the Dalai Lama, and sought refuge with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and Indian expansionists, cutting themselves off from the people. In the end, they will inevitably move towards destruction. The broad masses of the Tibetan people will be reborn from now on, and the unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland will be increasingly consolidated.

　　Indian Expansionists Will Inevitably Suffer a Shameful Defeat

　　Imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have been clamoring about our quelling of the Tibetan rebellion, while Indian expansionists, like imperialists, have openly expressed their expansionist ambitions, saying unfriendly things such as Tibet is not our territory, and openly discussing our country's problems in the Indian People's Assembly. A group of People's Socialist Party members, with the connivance of the Bombay police, openly made trouble at our consulate there and insulted the image of our leader Chairman Mao. All these actions were not at all what a friendly country should have, but were thoroughgoing imperialist practices of hostility towards our country. We express our utmost indignation and firm protest against this! We believe that any clamor, provocation, and practice cannot change the ironclad fact that Tibet has been an inseparable and sacred part of our country's territory since ancient times, nor can it push Tibet back to the era of the original reactionary upper-level rule, let alone hinder the vigorous construction of our socialist cause by the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The result can only expose the mask of peaceful coexistence of Indian expansionists to the people of the world. Many people have now righteously pointed out that the quelling of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair, and no other country can interfere. We are very happy to say that there are many people who say this not only in other countries, but also in India. The frenzied clamor of those expansionist elements will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat.

　　The great motherland is rising like the rising sun, becoming more and more prosperous and powerful every day, and the unity of all ethnic groups is becoming more and more consolidated every day. Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, move from victory to greater victory!

    真正破坏宗教的是那些叛乱分子
    孙孚凌委员的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长及政协全国委员会李维汉副主席的报告，并表示坚决贯彻执行。
    周总理的报告，雄辩地说明了在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，全国人民鼓起了革命的干劲，在一九五八年出现了史无前例的大跃进。这个大跃进，不仅是一九五八年在政治、经济、文化、科学等方面取得了重大的发展，而更重要的是为今后的大跃进提供了重要的基础。一九五九年的国家经济的发展，将在这个基础上进行更大、更好、更全面的跃进，更鼓舞了全国人民为建设美好的社会主义、共产主义的勇气和信心。
    在我们国家，各个民族都在进行着忘我的劳动，建设自己美好的家园的时候，西藏的一小撮上层反动分子竟公然破坏民族团结，勾结帝国主义和蒋匪帮及国外反动分子，叛变祖国，我们万分愤慨，我们坚决拥护国务院所发布的平息西藏叛乱及解散原西藏地方政府的命令。在西藏僧俗人民大力协助下，人民解放军已经基本上平息了叛乱，从此西藏人民就要搬掉压在自己头上的大山，将要和全国其他各族人民一样，逐步地经过改革，走到繁荣幸福的社会主义大道上来。
    宗教外衣掩盖不了豺狼真形
    中国共产党和中央人民政府一贯是坚决地执行着民族区域自治和各民族的宗教信仰自由的政策。我在一九五六年的秋冬之际，随着中央青年代表团到西藏去参加祝贺西藏的青年代表大会，虽然我们在西藏的时间不长，但已经深深地体会到党的这个伟大政策。我们在没有进入西藏以前，就开始学习藏族人民的风俗习惯，及尊重藏族人民宗教信仰上的一些应该注意的问题。我们到拉萨以后，看到满街上的人手里拿着转经筒在转经，经常可以看到有人在大昭寺朝佛礼拜。我们在西藏期间，正值中国佛教协会西藏分会开会，“西藏日报”把大家的发言都一律刊登，内容都是有关宗教的一些经义和问题。难道这不足以说明中央是如何尊重宗教信仰吗？而相反的真正破坏宗教的，却是那些打着保护宗教幌子和披着宗教外衣的叛乱分子。我们在西藏的时候，就已经知道有的寺院藏有武器，我虽然不是一个宗教的信徒，但是我相信在佛教的教义上不会有这么一条的。我们很想在拉萨参观哲蚌寺等，但是为了避免由寺中少数的反动分子引起的一些意外事件，所以我们就放弃了原来的打算。后来到了日喀则，才参观了扎什伦布寺。中央驻西藏的机关干部及人民解放军入藏部队对于达赖喇嘛都非常尊重的。我们在那里一切活动都是遵照党的政策来进行，对达赖喇嘛非常尊重。在我们离开拉萨到西藏的其他地方去访问以前，特别拜访了达赖喇嘛，并且请他对我们的工作加以指示。而相反地我们看看西藏的上层反动分子对达赖喇嘛是怎么样呢？在西藏青年代表大会开会的那一天，达赖喇嘛原来要出席大会，并准备讲话，但是因为少数上层反动分子的阻挠，不能出席参加，最后只好以朝拜达赖喇嘛的方式，在大会闭会后仅仅用了十分钟，全体代表才和达赖喇嘛见了面。至于在这次全国人民代表大会上，有的代表谈到的毒死热振活佛、毒死格达活佛、炮轰色拉寺等情况，在西藏那是尽人皆知的。这一切都充分地说明了谁是真正保护宗教、尊重宗教的，而谁是披着宗教外衣的民族叛徒和宗教叛徒。
    反动分子要在西藏维护的是什么？
    在唐朝的时候，唐太宗的宗室女文成公主，嫁给了藏王松赞干布，入藏的时候，带进去了许多工匠，把汉族的文化传播到了西藏，这在布达拉宫的壁画上都有所描绘。西藏的文化，也经过交流传到了内地，对于各族人民都有过不少的帮助。但是直到现在，西藏的社会制度仍旧是一千多年前的封建农奴制度；人民依旧过着极其贫困的生活；生产方式非常落后，在街上随时可以看到老百姓还在用手搓毛绳；工业是根本谈不到的。直到解放后拉萨才有了电灯。农业生产也同样是极为落后的。而少数贵族却过着奴役农奴的残酷剥削，豪华奢侈的生活。农奴不但吃不饱，穿不暖，而且到农奴主家里去做工或者应差役，不但要自备运输工具，同时连吃的也要自带，甚至连生命都不能自保。从这里可以看出历来的反动统治及帝国主义给西藏人民带来的是无限的灾难和痛苦。这一小撮叛乱分子和帝国主义、蒋匪帮以及印度扩张主义分子，口口声声讲些什么“民族自治”，实际上是要维护他们的非法特权，维护这样的一个落后的黑暗的封建农奴制度。
    我们清楚地知道实行民族自治是党的一贯的政策。我们在西藏的时候，西藏就已经成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，委员及工作人员中百分之九十都是藏族，上层人员都安排为委员等适当的工作岗位。但这些上层分子为了维护他们的封建农奴剥削制度，拒绝执行和平解放西藏的十七条协议，阻挠自治区筹委会工作的进行，一再反对改革，反对西藏民族的进步和发展，不但没有把藏军改编成为人民的军队，反而扩大藏军，蓄意叛变。在一九五六年那时，西康地方的叛匪，就是得到拉萨这些反动上层分子的指挥。我们在拉萨看到了广大的群众充分的表露出热爱毛主席、共产党及人民解放军的心情，对于中央青年代表团也非常的亲切热情，但同时我们也看到了少数反动分子反党反中央的破坏活动，有一天夜晚我们正在和拉萨青年联欢的时候，反动分子就在会场外面鸣枪挑衅。至于伤害入藏干部的事情，那就时有所闻。就是西藏上层分子中的进步人士，也要时刻警惕，以免遭受这些反动分子的毒手。反动分子的这些罪恶活动，论理早应遭受人民的审判，但是中央为了促使其觉悟，一再耐心等待，并在一九五六年底宣布在第二个五年计划期内不进行改革。广大的人民，包括进步的上中层人士，对于进行民主改革，是热烈的拥护，在青年代表大会上，有的劳动人民青年说道：种地要地钱，喝水要水钱，迫切要求立即进行改革。就是上层青年也在大会表示了农奴制度的不合理，积极的拥护改革。但是那些反动分子顽固到底，他们对中央的和平协商以及耐心等待的政策，看成软弱可欺，对广大人民包括上层进步分子的正当要求视若无睹，竟于三月十日公开叛变，撕毁十七条协议，劫持达赖喇嘛，投靠帝国主义、蒋匪帮及印度扩张主义者，自绝于人民，最后必定趋向于灭亡。而广大的西藏人民将从此得到新生，祖国各民族的团结将日益巩固。
    印度扩张主义者必遭可耻失败
    帝国主义及蒋匪帮对于我们平息西藏叛变，大肆叫嚣，而印度的扩张主义分子也和帝国主义一样，公然地表达了他们扩张主义的野心，说什么西藏不是我们的领土等等不友好的言论，公开地在印度的人民院讨论我们国家的问题。一群人民社会党徒，在孟买警察的纵容下，在该地我国领事馆公开的胡闹，并侮辱我国领袖毛主席的像。这一切行动丝毫没有像一个友好国家所应该有的，而彻头彻尾是敌视我国的帝国主义做法，我们对此表示万分的愤慨和坚决抗议！我们认为任何的叫嚣、挑衅和做法，改变不了西藏自古以来就是我国神圣领土不可分割的一部分这样铁一般的事实，也不可能把西藏再推回到原有的反动上层统治的时代里去，更不能阻挠我国各族人民大力地建设我们的社会主义事业，其结果只能使印度的扩张主义者向全世界人民暴露了他们伪装和平共处的假面具。现在已经有许多的人士正义地指出平息西藏叛乱完全是中国的内政，别的国家绝不能加以干涉。我们很高兴的是说这种话的人不仅在其他国家有，就是在印度也有不少。而那些扩张主义分子的疯狂叫嚣，必将遭受更加可耻的失败。
    伟大的祖国正在旭日东升地一天比一天的繁荣富强，各民族的团结也一天比一天的更加巩固，让我们在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，从胜利走向更大的胜利！
