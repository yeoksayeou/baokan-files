    The Pine Tree Family
  　Tài Rán
    The pine tree we usually talk about refers to the general term for various pine trees in the "Pinus" genus in plant taxonomy. In fact, there are many kinds of pine trees, making it quite a large family.

    There are nearly one hundred species of pine trees worldwide, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Some grow on the edge of the Arctic Circle, while others are distributed in the West Indies, North Africa, Asia Minor, and the Indochina Peninsula. Their distribution is patterned and not haphazard, which is the law of plant distribution according to geographical and climatic conditions.

    More than twenty species of pine trees grow on the vast land of our motherland, accounting for about a quarter of the total number of pine tree species in the world. The main ones are as follows: Scots pine grows in the Greater Khingan Mountains, and is a representative tree species in the permafrost area. It is also the most precious tree species there, and its needles are in bundles of two. The only shrubby small tree in the Pinus genus is the dwarf Siberian pine, distributed on the high mountains from the Greater Khingan Mountains to the Changbai Mountains. Some grow on mountain ridges, and some grow under forests, creeping densely. Other plants can hardly invade its clusters, and its seeds are raw materials in the food industry. Speaking of red pine, many people know that its wood is very good. It is a precious tree species famous in the world for its excellent material. It is mainly distributed on the southern slope of the Lesser Khingan Mountains all the way to the Changbai Mountains, and its leaves are in bundles of five. The fruit of the red pine is very large, and the seeds are fragrant and delicious, and people love to eat it. On the coast of the Bohai Sea, the Liaodong Peninsula, and the Shandong Peninsula, red pine is the landmark tree species in this area, and its needles are in bundles of two. The native home of Chinese red pine is North China, and its northern boundary of distribution reaches the Ural Mountains in Inner Mongolia, no further south than the Qinling Mountains, west to the Qilian Mountains, and east to central Shandong where it meets red pine. Within this area, it grows from the plains all the way to high mountains at an altitude of three thousand meters. Whitebark pine is loved by people for its smooth and beautiful trunk. Although its hometown is mainly in the mountainous areas of Hebei and Shanxi, people have been transplanting it everywhere for a long time. Now, cities such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuhan have all planted it, and its leaves are in bundles of three. Speaking of Armand pine, it does not only grow in Mount Hua, but is named because it was first discovered there. In fact, it is the most widely and sporadically distributed pine tree. In the Qinling Mountains, in the Funiu Mountains in Henan, in western Hubei, northeastern Guizhou, southern Gansu, southwestern Sichuan, and central Yunnan, there are traces of its scattered distribution. The material is good, and the seeds are large and edible. The pine tree with the largest distribution area is Masson's pine. It is settled in fourteen provinces (regions) from the Yangtze River basin to the south, with a clear boundary with Chinese red pine in the north, and adjacent to the distribution area of ​​Yunnan pine in the west. Yunnan pine grows into very dense forests, and is the highest in resin content in China. Huangshan pine is distributed in East China, living on the top of the high mountains here. On the high mountains where Masson's pine cannot grow, it develops and reproduces. In addition, in the Altai Mountains of Xinjiang, Siberian pine is distributed. In Taiwan, there are Taiwan red pine and Taiwan white pine. In the Wuling Mountains, there is Guangdong pine with very beautiful tree shapes. Hainan Island grows Hainan red pine and Hainan white pine, etc.

    Various pine trees in various places are being widely planted and nurtured by us. Many pine trees have played their due role in the great socialist construction cause. Not only the trunk and roots, but also the tree sap, leaves, and bark are useful. Even the fruits and pollen are not wasted. With the development of science, the growing range of pine trees will be further expanded, the growth rate of pine trees will be accelerated, and the uses of pine trees will be further expanded.

    松树这个家族
  　太然
    我们平常所讲的松树，是指植物分类学上“松属”各种松树的统称。其实，松树有很多种，算得是一个大家族。
    全世界约有将近一百种松树，普遍的分布在北半球，有的生长在北极圈的边缘，有的分布到西印度群岛、北非洲、小亚细亚、印度支那半岛等地。它们的分布情况，是有规律可寻的，不是杂乱无章的，这就是植物按地理、气候条件分布的规律。
    在祖国广大的土地上生长着二十多种松树，约占全世界松树种类总数的四分之一，主要的有以下各种：樟子松生长在大兴安岭山区，是这里恒冻层地区的代表树种，也是那里最珍贵的树种，它的针叶两针为一束。在松属之中唯一的灌木性的小乔木是偃松，分布在大兴安岭一直至长白山一带的高山上，有的长在山脊上，有的长在树林下面，密密丛丛匍匐的生长着，别的植物几乎无法侵入它的丛团里去，它的种子是食品工业中的原料。提起红松，很多人都知道它的木材很好，它是以材质优良而闻名于世界的珍贵树种，主要分布在小兴安岭南坡直到长白山一带，它的叶子是五个针叶为一束。红松的果实很大，种子香甜可口，人们很爱吃它。在渤海沿岸、辽东半岛和山东半岛，赤松是这个地区的标志树种，它是两根针叶一束。油松以华北为故乡，分布的北界到内蒙古乌拉尔山，南不过秦岭，西到祁连山，东到山东中部和赤松相接。在这个地区内，它从平原一直生长到海拔三千公尺的高山上。白皮松以树干光洁美丽为人们所爱好，虽然它的故乡主要是在河北、山西的山区，但是人们很久以来就向各处移栽，现在上海、苏州、杭州、武汉等城市都已栽植了，它的叶子是三根针叶一束。谈到华山松，它并不只生长于华山，而是因为最初在那里发现而订名的原故，其实它倒是分布最广最零星的一种松树。在秦岭，在河南伏牛山，在湖北西部、贵州东北部、甘肃南部、四川西南部、云南中部，都有它零星分布的踪迹。材质也好，种子粒儿大，可以吃。在松树中分布面最大的要算是马尾松了，它定居在长江流域至以南共十四个省（区），北边与油松有明显的分界，西边和云南松的分布区相衔接。云南松以云南为分布中心，东边在四川大渡河、贵州西部、广西西部和马尾松分界。它生长成林非常密茂，在中国来说是松脂含量最高的一种。黄山松分布在华东，居住在这里的高山顶上，在马尾松不能生长的高山，就由它发展繁育。此外，像新疆的阿尔泰山，分布着西伯利亚松。在台湾有台湾二叶松和台湾五叶松。五岭山脉一带有树形很漂亮的广东松。海南岛生长着海南二叶松和海南五叶松等。
    各地的各种松树，都正在为我们广泛的栽植和抚育着。很多的松树在伟大的社会主义建设事业中起了应有的作用，不但树干、树根，树液、树叶和树皮都是有用的，就连果实、花粉也都没有浪费。随着科学的发展，松树的生长范围将更加扩大，松树的生长速度将更加增快，松树的用途也将更加扩展。
