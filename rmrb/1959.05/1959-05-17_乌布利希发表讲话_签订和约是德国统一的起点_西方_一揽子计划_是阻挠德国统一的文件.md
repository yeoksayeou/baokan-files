Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 15th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, stated this afternoon at the Sixth National Congress of the Free German Youth League in Rostock that "People can regard the 'package plan' proposed by Western countries at the Geneva Conference, which suits Adenauer's wishes, as a document obstructing German reunification."

Ulbricht said that the Western countries' plan makes the conclusion of a peace treaty the last measure, which means that all steps serving the so-called "reunification" will be carried out under the conditions of West German atomic armament, militarism in West German rule, and preparations for civil war. This also means holding elections in West Germany under the pressure of atomic armament and militarism; and in the name of "democracy," allowing revanchist and militarist propaganda in the German Democratic Republic as well. After doing so, the Western countries believe they will have a decisive majority to drive the entire Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is clear that this proposal, which suits Adenauer, is nothing but organizing a civil war and developing it into a war.

Ulbricht said that the "package plan" proposed by Western countries will disappear into the archives. He said: "We hope that the foreign ministers participating in the Foreign Ministers Conference will now transition to realistically discussing the main issues, namely, discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the normalization of the situation in West Berlin."

Ulbricht said that the Foreign Ministers Conference was able to be convened in Geneva due to the Soviet Union's peaceful efforts and changes in the global balance of power. The Foreign Ministers Conference has the task of preparing for a summit meeting, and the central topic of its discussion is to eliminate the hotbed of war danger in Germany.

When talking about the issue of German reunification, Ulbricht said that at present, there is no other way than to start with the signing of a peace treaty to bring the two Germanys closer and achieve peaceful cooperation. He also said that German reunification can only be a matter for the German people themselves and between the two Germanys.

Ulbricht condemned the Bonn government's rejection of the German Democratic Republic's proposal and its unwillingness to negotiate on preparing a peace treaty and organizing a confederation of the two Germanys before the Geneva Conference. He said that since the delegations of the two Germanys participated in the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference with equal rights, the ruling class in West Germany may slowly understand that as long as they continue to refuse equal negotiations between the two German governments, they are in the wrong position.

Ulbricht said that rejecting a peace treaty is a policy that violates the peaceful national interests of the German people. If the Bonn government continues to refuse to conclude a peace treaty, then, as Khrushchev said, the Soviet Union and other countries will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

Ulbricht added that even in this case, we will simultaneously do everything possible to achieve a change in the political situation in West Germany as quickly as possible, so that West Germany can conclude a peace treaty and realize a confederation of the two German states. It is just that this path has become longer due to the responsibility of the Bonn government.

    乌布利希发表讲话
    签订和约是德国统一的起点
    西方“一揽子计划”是阻挠德国统一的文件
    新华社柏林15日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希今天下午在罗斯托克举行的自由德国青年联盟第六次全国代表大会上说，“人们可以把西方国家在日内瓦会议上提出的适合阿登纳心意的‘一揽子计划’看作是阻挠德国重新统一的文件。”
    乌布利希说，西方国家的计划把缔结和约作为最后一项措施，这意味着为所谓“重新统一”服务的一切步骤都将在西德原子武装、军国主义在西德统治和准备内战的条件下进行。这还意味着在原子武装和军国主义的压力下在西德进行选举；并在“民主”的名义下也在德意志民主共和国准许复仇主义和军国主义的宣传。这样做之后，西方国家认为就能拥有一个决定的多数，把整个德国驱入北大西洋集团。可见，这个适合阿登纳的方案的建议不是别的，而只是意味着组织内战并由此发展为战争而已。
    乌布利希说，西方国家提出的“一揽子计划”就要消失在档案馆里。他说：“我们希望参加外长会议的外长们现在将过渡到现实地讨论主要问题，即讨论对德和约和西柏林局势正常化问题。”
    乌布利希说，由于苏联的和平努力以及世界力量对比发生了变化，使得外长会议得以在日内瓦召开。外长会议有任务准备召开最高级会议，它讨论的中心题目是消除德国的战争危险温床。
    在谈到德国统一问题时，乌布利希说，现在，除了通过以签订和约为起点，使两个德国接近和和平合作以外，没有其他道路。他还说，德国统一只能是德国人民自己的和两个德国之间的事情。
    乌布利希谴责波恩政府拒绝德意志民主共和国的建议，不愿意在日内瓦会议之前就准备和约和就组织两个德国的邦联进行谈判。他说，自从两个德国的代表团在日内瓦外长会议上以同等权利参加以后，西德的统治阶层或许会慢慢懂得，只要他们继续拒绝在两个德国政府之间进行平等的谈判，他们就是处在错误的位置之中。
    乌布利希说，拒绝和约是一个与德国人民的和平的民族利益相违背的政策。如果波恩政府继续拒绝缔结和约，那么就像赫鲁晓夫所说，苏联和其他国家就将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
    乌布利希又说，即使在这种情况下，我们也将同时尽一切力量达到使西德的政治情况尽可能快地发生改变，以便使西德缔结和约和实现两个德国国家的邦联。只是这条路由于波恩政府的责任变得长了一些。
