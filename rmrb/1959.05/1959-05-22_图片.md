    The title of this painting is "Comrade Georgi Dimitrov at the Leipzig Court in 1933," and the artist is Bulgarian painter Mikhailov Peter. It is an exhibit from the recently opened "Bulgarian Modern Plastic Arts Exhibition" in Beijing.

    This is an epic oil painting. The content depicts the scene in March 1933, when Comrade Dimitrov was arrested by the German fascists on the fabricated charge of "burning the Reichstag," and fought against the fascists in the dock of the Leipzig court. During the interrogation, Comrade Dimitrov thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of the Hitler fascists to create the Reichstag fire, turning the court into a platform for propagating communism. With skillful techniques, the painter vividly and realistically shaped the glorious image of a communist fighting heroically in the face of the enemy. The composition arrangement and color processing of the picture also strengthened the expression of this theme.

    这幅画题目叫“1933年在莱比锡法庭上的格奥尔基·季米特洛夫同志”，作者是保加利亚画家米哈伊洛夫·彼特尔。这是最近在北京开幕的“保加利亚现代造型艺术展览会”的展品。
    这是一幅史诗性的油画。内容是描绘1933年3月，季米特洛夫同志被德国法西斯捏造“焚烧国会”的罪名被捕后，在莱比锡法庭的被告席上与法西斯进行斗争的情景。季米特洛夫同志在审讯的过程中，彻底揭发了希特勒法西斯制造国会纵火案的阴谋，把法庭变成了宣传共产主义的讲台。画家以熟练的技巧，生动而逼真地塑造出了一个共产党人在敌人面前英勇斗争的光辉的形象。画面的构图安排和色彩处理，也都加强了这一主题的表达。
