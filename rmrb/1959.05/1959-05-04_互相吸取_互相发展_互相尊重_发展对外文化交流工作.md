Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the other reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I would like to briefly report to the congress on some aspects of our country's foreign cultural work.

**Countries and Regions Establishing Cultural Ties and Friendly Exchanges with China Span the Globe**

In the past decade, our foreign cultural and friendly work has greatly developed. As of now, 104 countries and regions have established cultural ties and friendly exchanges with us. We have established friendship associations with all socialist countries and some countries in Asia and Africa. Forty-six friendship organizations toward China have been established in thirty-eight countries, with their more than five hundred branches spread across five continents.

Cultural cooperation between China and various socialist countries began earliest and developed fastest in our entire foreign cultural work. The Soviet Union was the first to send a delegation of cultural and artistic workers to China to participate in the founding ceremony. Since then, cultural and friendly exchanges between China and various socialist countries have become increasingly frequent. Up to now, China has successively signed cultural cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries. In addition to the well-known mutual visits and exchange of information, more planned, systematic, and comprehensive cultural cooperation is being developed recently. We have signed a scientific cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union, cooperation agreements between the academies of sciences of both sides with many socialist countries, health cooperation agreements, broadcasting cooperation agreements, and agreements on sports exchange activities. China's cultural exchanges and cooperation with socialist countries, whether in terms of the increase in quantity, the expansion of scale, or the richness and diversity of methods and content of cooperation, deeply reflect the rapid development of the economic and cultural life of socialist countries, as well as the internationalist spirit of fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation and the increasingly consolidated unity between them. In particular, in the great leap forward of China's socialist construction, and in the development of cultural and technical revolutions, we have also obtained valuable knowledge, experience, and professional talents from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries through cultural cooperation.

China has also widely developed and is developing cultural exchanges, cooperation, and friendly interactions with many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Especially from the Bandung Conference to the present, in these regions, just in terms of countries with personnel exchanges in culture and art with China, the number has increased from more than ten to more than forty. In the past year alone, Iraq, Yemen, Oman, Morocco, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, Somaliland, Uganda, Angola, Venezuela, Paraguay, and many other countries have newly established cultural exchanges with China. Last year, after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, during the nationwide celebration of the great victory of the Iraqi people and the movement against imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and interference in the Iraqi revolution, we warmly welcomed the first visiting Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation, Cultural Delegation, and Social Activist Representatives. They had extensive contact with Chinese cultural figures and exchanged knowledge in various fields. In recent years, especially in the past year, our cultural delegations sent to many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been countless. Chinese figures from the cultural, educational, and scientific circles, with the spirit of respecting the national traditional culture of the other party and humbly learning from their strengths and exchanging knowledge, have paid friendly visits to these countries or have been invited to participate in scientific and cultural gatherings held by them. China has begun to exchange students with many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and has carried out exchange activities in many aspects such as exchanging films and holding exhibitions. In terms of mutual translation and publication, in the past year, we translated and published more than 500 kinds of foreign works, with more than 4.4 million copies, many of which belong to countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Chinese people attach great importance to the works and collections of speeches of leaders and famous figures of these countries. The modern and classical literary and artistic creations of these countries are often sold out as soon as they are published. The translation and publication of Chinese works in these countries is also increasing. Chairman Mao's works and literary and academic creations, as well as other works, are increasingly loved by the vast number of people in various countries. China and many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have similarly suffered the disastrous consequences of imperialist aggression. In order to defend and develop national culture, and in order to overcome the state of cultural backwardness, our mutual learning and mutual assistance in cultural exchanges with these countries should be said to have very broad fields and great prospects.

We also have had and are still having many, mainly non-governmental, cultural ties and friendly exchanges with some Western countries, from Northern Europe and Western Europe to Australia. Last year, the president of Canadian universities and other friends also visited China. Only with the United States, due to the lack of diplomatic relations between us, and due to the very bad relationship between the two countries caused by the United States' policy of hostility toward China, there is not much cultural contact between us. Just to make a simple calculation, I remember that in 1955, the U.S. government once obstructed the implementation of the exchange performance agreement signed by the Chinese art troupe and the U.S. Everyman Theatre, and once prevented famous American cultural figures who were invited to China to participate in the centennial celebration of the publication of American poet Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" from going abroad. In 1956, when we held the Franklin Memorial Meeting, we invited more than a dozen well-known figures in the American cultural and scientific circles, but none of them came due to the obstruction of the U.S. government. In 1957, when twenty-six American newspaper agencies requested to send reporters to China for interviews, the U.S. government again adopted the unreasonable measure of only allowing American reporters to come to China and not allowing Chinese reporters to go to the United States, preventing mutual visits between Chinese and American reporters. I can also mention a joke in passing: The American people very much hope to get China's special product, the giant panda, but their government prohibits the import of giant pandas on the pretext of not having contact with "Red China." The American imperialists are so afraid of even China's giant pandas. Isn't this exposing its panic and timidity? The Chinese people are friendly to the American people. American writer Anna Louise Strong is visiting China, and the famous black scholar W.E.B. Du Bois and his wife also left China not long ago. They have all been warmly welcomed and received by the Chinese people, and we believe that they will bring our friendship back to the American people.

**Our Foreign Cultural Exchange Work Implements the Principles of Equality, Mutual Benefit, and Mutual Respect; In contrast, Imperialism is Cultural Aggression, Forcibly Bringing the so-called "Western Civilization" into all Oppressed Countries**

Now I would like to take this opportunity to talk about one of our experiences in the practice of foreign cultural work, that is, the issue of our foreign cultural work must continue to adhere to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect.

As early as 1940, Chairman Mao Zedong stated in "On New Democracy" that Chinese culture should unite with the progressive cultures of all other nations to establish a relationship of mutual absorption and mutual development. This clearly points out a general guideline and goal for our cultural ties with the people of all countries, and it also marks an important feature of the entire foreign cultural work of our People's China. According to written records, the cultural ties between China and foreign countries have a history of more than two thousand years. However, the spirit of the foreign cultural ties conducted by liberated China in the past decade is very different from the past. We advocate free and equal cultural ties and are willing to establish cultural ties and cooperation with any country on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. In cultural exchanges, we advocate enthusiastic mutual assistance and oppose imposing on others. On the one hand, we must follow what Chairman Mao once instructed: "China should absorb a large amount of foreign progressive culture as raw materials for its own cultural food... Anything that we can use today should be absorbed." On the other hand, we should also do our best to introduce and help enthusiastically when others need to understand or draw materials from us, but we never ask people to copy or implement our set of guidelines and methods. For example, when others welcome our books and periodicals, movies, etc., we send them; when others do not welcome them, we never force them to send them. The same is true for personnel exchanges; we never force people if they are unwilling to interact with us. We believe that the spirit of mutual respect must be implemented in cultural ties. We ourselves must oppose both the national inferiority complex of belittling ourselves and the great-power chauvinism of arrogant self-aggrandizement, especially the ideological style of conceit, pride, and exaggeration must be resolutely overcome and prevented. Therefore, in our contacts and interactions with foreign friends, we have always insisted on the policy of introducing achievements and not concealing shortcomings. The honest and down-to-earth, scientific attitude that the Party and Chairman Mao often teach us must also be adhered to unswervingly in our foreign cultural work.

Imperialist cultural aggression is exactly the opposite of the free and equal cultural ties that we advocate, and of course, we firmly oppose it. The Chinese people have suffered deeply from its oppression and poisoning for more than a hundred years before liberation, and our generation should have a deep understanding of this situation. The set of "cultural ties" advocated and carried out by the monopoly ruling groups of imperialist countries fundamentally does not mention any equality, mutual benefit, or mutual respect. No matter how skillfully it is disguised, it will eventually not be able to conceal its true face of aggression. The imperialists want to forcibly bring their so-called "Western civilization" into all oppressed countries, to have the schools in these countries use their textbooks and languages, to have the people of these countries live the so-called American way of life with them, to send a large number of obscene and poisonous books and periodicals and movies to these countries to flood and spread, etc., in a word, to try to make the local national culture unable to raise its head, wither away, and then tend to extinction, so that the local people can not raise their heads, or even forget their national traditions at all, so that the imperialists can manipulate them at will. This set of cultural aggression activities carried out by the imperialists is precisely to cover up their acts of aggression and occupation and to serve the cold war policy of opposing socialist countries and creating international tension. The "two Chinas" conspiracy that they are planning and playing with in many ways is a clear example. As Premier Zhou said in the government work report, "We are willing to establish ties and cooperate with other countries in international organizations and international conferences, but we will never participate in international activities where the so-called 'two Chinas' situation may occur." Our basic attitude towards international cultural activities is exactly the same, without exception. Our sports organizations resolutely withdrew from some international sports organizations last year in order to expose and counter the "two Chinas" conspiracy arranged by the imperialist elements. These elements say that they only talk about sports and not about politics. This is very ridiculous. It is precisely them who are playing political tricks to serve the imperialist conspiracy, especially the U.S. imperialism's attempt to split China and continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan. It is also very stupid and pitiful for some people to think that they can push China out of some international activities and feel complacent about it. Frankly speaking, the Chinese people have already seen the problem clearly, and we fundamentally despise the overall planning and arrangement of the ideological and cultural aggression carried out by imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism. Because the foreign cultural and friendly work of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect advocated and implemented by the Chinese people is in line with the five principles of peaceful coexistence, it will inevitably be welcomed and supported by the people of all countries. On the contrary, what accompanies imperialist cultural aggression is poisoning and enslavement, which will inevitably be met with increasingly strong disgust and resistance from the people of all regions.

The free and equal cultural ties that we advocate are in line with the common wishes of the people of all countries and the just people of all countries, and are a general trend of human cultural exchange, so they cannot be resisted by any force.

**Further Strengthen Cultural Exchange Work**

Western capitalist culture is declining day by day, and socialist culture is advancing by leaps and bounds; the national cultures of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also thriving and heading for rebirth in the struggle against imperialist cultural aggression. This is a very favorable situation for us. Fellow representatives, at the glorious moment of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, warm and touching cheers and encouraging voices from friends from all over the world have been heard. They have put forward to us the beautiful wish of strengthening cultural exchanges and friendly interactions. We are completely willing and completely necessary to further develop cultural ties and friendly interactions with various friendly countries and the people of all countries in accordance with the spirit and principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect, because this will be conducive to the socialist construction of our country and conducive to maintaining the international peace cause.

The Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee was established last year in accordance with the decision of the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress on adjusting the organizational structure under the State Council. In the past year, it has undertaken quite heavy tasks, but we lack experience, and there are inevitably many shortcomings in our work. In the future, foreign cultural work must also be carried out jointly by further organizing domestic human and material resources under the premise of contributing to the country's socialist construction and following our country's peaceful diplomatic policy. We believe that relying on the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, relying on the support and assistance of the broad masses of the people and people from all walks of life in the country, and the joint efforts of various fraternal departments and groups, foreign cultural ties and friendly interactions can be further developed. Regarding our work and my speech today, I sincerely hope that all representatives will give criticisms and suggestions.

    互相吸取　互相发展　互相尊重
    发展对外文化交流工作
    张奚若代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的其他各项报告。现在我谨就我国对外文化工作的一些情况向大会作一简略汇报。
    同我国建立文化联系和友好往来的国家和地区遍及全球
    将近十年来，我们的对外文化友好工作有了很大的发展。截至目前为止，和我们建立文化联系和友好往来的国家和地区，已经有一百零四个。我国对所有社会主义国家和亚洲、非洲一些国家成立了友好协会：有三十八个国家成立了四十六个对我国的友好团体，它们的五百多个分会，遍及全球五大洲。
    我国同各社会主义国家之间的文化合作，在我们整个对外文化工作中开展得最早，发展得最快。苏联第一个派遣了文化艺术工作者代表团来我国参加开国大典；以后，我国同各社会主义国家之间的文化友好往来也就日趋频繁。到现在我国已先后与苏联及其他所有社会主义国家签订了文化合作协定。合作的内容除了大家所熟知的互相访问、交换资料等等以外，最近一个时期正在开展更有计划、更有系统的全面的文化合作。我们已经同苏联签订了科学合作协定，与许多社会主义国家签订了双方科学院的合作协议，保健合作协定，广播合作协定，和体育来往活动的协议。我国同社会主义国家的文化交流和合作，无论从数量的增长、规模的扩大上说，或是从方式方法和合作内容的丰富多彩上说，都深深地体现出社会主义国家经济和文化生活一日千里的发展，以及彼此间兄弟般互助合作的国际主义精神和日益巩固的团结。特别是我国在社会主义建设事业大跃进中，在文化革命和技术革命的开展中，通过文化合作，也取得了苏联和其他社会主义国家的各种宝贵的知识、经验和专业人材的支援。
    我国同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家，也普遍地开展了并正在开展着文化交流、合作和友好往来。特别是从万隆会议以来到目前，在这几个地区、单就和我国有文化艺术方面人员往来的国家，就已经从十余国增加到四十余国。仅在过去的一年里，开始同我国有了文化往来的、就又增加了伊拉克、也门、阿曼、摩洛哥、加纳、塞内加尔、尼日利亚、索马里兰、乌干达、安哥拉、委内瑞拉、巴拉圭等许多国家。去年伊拉克共和国成立以后，我们在全国人民热烈庆祝伊拉克人民的伟大胜利和反对帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩、约旦、干涉伊拉克革命的运动，热烈欢迎了初次来访的伊拉克人民友好访华团、文化代表团和社会活动家代表。他们和我国文化界人士广泛接触，彼此交流了各方面的知识。这些年来，特别是过去一年中，我们派遣到亚、非和拉丁美洲许多国家的文化代表团，可说是络绎不绝。我国的文、教、科学各界人士抱着尊敬对方的民族传统文化和虚心学习他们的长处并交换知识的心情和意愿，前往这些国家进行了友好访问，或是应邀参加了他们所举行的科学、文化集会。我国同亚、非、拉丁美洲的许多国家已经开始交换留学生，开展了交换电影、互办展览等多方面的活动。在互相翻译出版方面，过去一年内我们翻译出版外国著作五百余种、四百余万册中，有不少是属于亚、非、拉丁美洲国家的。我国人民十分重视这些国家的领导人和著名人士的著作和言论集。这些国家的现代和古典文艺创作往往刚一出版就销售一空。这些国家翻译出版我国著作也在增长，毛主席的著作和文艺学术创作，以及其他方面的著作，也越来越多地受到各国广大人民的喜爱。我国和亚、非、拉丁美洲许多国家同样承受了帝国主义侵略的灾难性的后果。为了保卫和发展民族文化，为了克服文化落后的状态，我们和这些国家在文化交流中的互相学习和互相帮助应该说是有着十分广阔的园地和远大的前途。
    我们和西方一些国家，从北欧、西欧到澳洲，也有过并且还正在有着许多的主要是民间的文化联系和友好往来。去年加拿大的大学校长和其他方面的朋友也曾访问过中国。只有和美国，由于我们之间没有外交关系，而且由于美国所采取的与中国为敌的政策所造成的两国关系十分恶劣的情况，我们之间也就没有甚么文化联系。随便算一笔账，记得是一九五五年，美国政府曾经阻挠了我国艺术团同美国人人剧团所订交换演出协议的执行，曾经阻止应邀来我国参加纪念美国诗人惠特曼的“草叶集”出版一百周年大会的美国文化界著名人士出国；一九五六年，我们举行富兰克林纪念会，邀请了十几位美国文化科学界知名人士，也由于美国政府的阻挠，一个也没有来成；一九五七年，美国二十六家报社要求派记者来华访问时，美国政府又采取只许美国记者来华、不许我国记者赴美的无理手段，阻止中美记者的互相访问。还可以顺便提到一个笑话：美国人民非常希望得到我国特产的大熊猫，他们的政府却借口不与“红色中国”往来而禁止大熊猫进口。美国帝国主义者连对我国的大熊猫都如此害怕，这不正是暴露它的惶恐和心虚吗？中国人民对美国人民是友好的；美国作家斯特朗女士正在中国访问，著名的黑人学者杜波伊斯和他的夫人也在不久以前才离开中国，他们都受到了中国人民的热诚欢迎和接待，我们相信他们是会把我们的友情带回给美国人民的。
    我们对外文化交流工作是执行了平等互利互相尊重的原则；与此相反的，帝国主义是文化侵略，把所谓“西方文明”强行带入一切被压迫国家
    现在我借这个机会谈一点我们在对外文化工作实践中的体会，就是关于我们的对外文化工作必须继续坚持平等互利、互相尊重的原则这样一个问题。
    毛泽东主席早在一九四○年发表的“新民主主义论”中就曾经谈到中国的文化要同一切别的民族的进步文化相联合，建立互相吸收和互相发展的关系。这正是十分明确地指出了我们和各国人民进行文化联系的一项总的方针和目标，也正是标志了我们人民中国整个对外文化工作的一个重要特征。中国和外国的文化联系，按文字记载，也总有两千多年的历史了。但是解放了的中国，将近十年以来所进行的对外文化联系，其精神面貌是与过去大不相同的。我们主张自由平等的文化联系，愿意在平等互利、互相尊重的基础上同任何一个国家建立文化上的联系和合作。我们在文化往来中，提倡热诚互助，而反对强加于人。一方面一定要遵照毛主席曾经指示过的：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料……凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收”；另一方面，别人需要向我们了解或取材的，我们也应该尽力之所及热诚地介绍和帮助，但是我们绝不要求人家照搬或实行我们的一套方针和办法。譬如我们的书刊、电影等，别人欢迎时，我们送去；别人不欢迎，我们绝不勉强发送。在人员来往上，也是一个道理；人家不愿意和我们来往，我们绝不强求。我们认为，在文化联系中，一定要贯彻互相尊重的精神。我们自己既要反对妄自菲薄的民族自卑思想，也要反对妄自尊大的大国主义，特别是矜骄浮夸的思想作风必须坚决加以克服和防止。因此我们在和外国朋友的联系和接触中，一向坚持既要介绍成就、也不隐讳缺点的方针。党和毛主席时常教导我们的老老实实的、科学的态度，我们在对外文化工作中一定也要信守不渝。
    帝国主义的文化侵略，是与我们所提倡的自由平等的文化联系恰恰相反的，当然是我们坚决反对的。中国人民在解放前的一百多年中曾经深受其压迫和毒害，我们这一辈的人对此中梗概应该是深刻了然的。帝国主义国家垄断统治集团所主张和进行的一套“文化联系”，是根本谈不到甚么平等互利、互相尊重的。无论它怎样巧于装扮，也终将掩盖不住它的侵略的真面目。帝国主义者要把他们一套所谓的“西方文明”强行带入一切被压迫的国家，要这些国家的学校使用他们的课本和语言，要这些国家的人民跟他们一起过甚么美国生活方式，要把大量的诲淫诲盗的书刊和电影送到这些国家去泛滥流行等等，一句话，企图使当地的民族文化抬不起头来，枯萎下去，进而趋于消灭，使当地的人民抬不起头来，乃至根本遗忘自己的民族传统，以便于帝国主义者随心所欲地去摆布他们。帝国主义者所搞的这一套文化侵略活动，正是为他们的侵略霸占行为打掩护，为反对社会主义国家、制造国际紧张局势的冷战政策服务的。他们正在多方面策划玩弄的“两个中国”的阴谋，就是一个明显的例证。正如周总理在政府工作报告中所说，“我们愿意在国际组织和国际会议中同其他国家建立联系和进行合作，但是，凡是有可能出现所谓‘两个中国’局面的国际活动，我们决不参加。”我们对于国际文化活动的一项基本态度也正是如此，毫不例外。我们的体育组织去年为了揭露和反击帝国主义分子所布置的“两个中国”的阴谋而坚决退出了一些国际体育组织；这些分子说甚么他们只谈体育，不谈政治。这是十分可笑的。玩弄政治把戏，为帝国主义的阴谋、特别是为美帝国主义妄图分裂中国、继续霸占我国的领土台湾的侵略行为服务的，正是他们。有些人以为借此可以把中国从一些国际活动的场合中排挤出去而自以为得计，也是十分愚蠢可怜的。老实说，中国人民早已把问题看得清清楚楚，对于帝国主义主要是美帝国主义所搞的一套思想文化侵略的策划和安排，就其全局来说，我们是根本加以蔑视的。因为中国人民所主张和实行的平等互利、互相尊重的对外文化友好工作，是符合和平共处的五项原则的，因而也必然会受到各国人民的欢迎和支持；相反，随着帝国主义文化侵略伴随而来的是毒害和奴役，就必然会受到各地人民愈来愈强烈的厌恶和反抗。
    我们所主张的自由平等的文化联系，符合于各国人民和各国公正人士的共同愿望，是人类文化交流的一个总的趋向，因此是任何势力所不能抗阻的。
    进一步加强文化交流工作
    西方资本主义的文化正在日趋没落，社会主义的文化正在一日千里地前进；亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多国家的民族文化在反抗帝国主义文化侵略的斗争中也正在欣欣向荣，走向新生。这是一个对我们十分有利的形势。各位代表，在行将庆祝中华人民共和国建国十周年的光荣时刻，四面八方已经传来了各国朋友们热情可感的欢呼和鼓励的声音；他们向我们提出了加强文化交流和友好往来的美好愿望。我们完全情愿、也完全有必要按照平等互利、互相尊重的精神和原则、进一步开展同各个友好国家和各国人民的文化联系和友好往来，因为这将有利于我们国家的社会主义建设事业，有利于维护国际和平事业。
    对外文化联络委员会，是去年根据第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议关于调整国务院所属组织机构的决定设立的。一年以来，担负着相当繁重的任务，而我们又缺乏经验，工作中不免有许多缺点。今后的对外文化工作，还必须在有助于国家社会主义建设的前提下，遵循我国的和平外交政策，进一步组织国内各方面的人力物力去共同进行。我们相信，依靠中国共产党和国务院的领导，依靠国内广大人民、社会各界人士的支持和帮助，以及各个兄弟部门和团体的共同努力，对外文化联系和友好往来是可以得到进一步的开展的。关于我们的工作和我今天的发言，我诚恳地希望各位代表予以批评和指正。
