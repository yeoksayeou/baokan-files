How the Former Tibetan Local Government Sabotaged the Agreement on Reorganizing the Tibetan Army
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Guo Chaoren

May 23rd marks the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet between the Central People's Government and the former Tibetan local government. Since the signing of this agreement in 1951, the reactionary clique of the Tibetan upper class and the reactionaries in the former Tibetan local government have tried every possible means to obstruct and sabotage it, so that many important clauses of this agreement have not been realized. For example, Article 8 of the agreement stipulates that "the Tibetan army shall be reorganized step by step into the People's Liberation Army and become a part of the national defense armed forces of the People's Republic of China." However, in the past eight years, not only has this army not been reorganized at all, but the former Tibetan local government has also illegally expanded it in terms of manpower and equipment, using this army as a tool to oppose the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army.

The overall person in charge of the old Tibetan army was called "Maji" (Commander-in-Chief), and the "Maji" office was called "Maji Kang" (Headquarters), which was divided into six "Daiben" (each Daiben varied in size, generally equivalent to a regiment). In 1951, when Tibet was peacefully liberated, the total number of officers and soldiers in the six Daiben was only over 1,400. However, in the past eight years, the former Tibetan local government has expanded this army by more than double. It is now verified that in June 1952, according to incomplete statistics, the former Tibetan local government conscripted 500 people in one go to restore the Third Daiben, which had been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Qamdo Campaign. After the democratic reforms in the former Xikang region in 1956, a small number of serf owners launched an armed rebellion, and the former Tibetan local government also conscripted troops on a large scale at this time. From the second half of 1956, the First Daiben increased by more than 250 people, the Second Daiben increased by more than 250 people, and the Third Daiben increased by 240 people, totaling more than 740 people. In 1957, the First Daiben increased by another 200 people, the Second and Third Daiben each increased by 300 people, and the Fourth Daiben increased by 100 people, totaling about 900 people. In 1958, the Fifth Daiben increased by more than 250 people. Excluding the soldiers who fled, the total number of Tibetan troops exceeded 3,000 until before March 10th this year.

At the same time, the former Tibetan local government also continuously imported military supplies from abroad, most of which were automatic weapons and heavy weapons. If we compare the equipment of the Tibetan army in 1954 with the equipment in 1958, the First Daiben increased by 8 mortars, 44 light machine guns, 200 submachine guns, and 300 rifles; the Second Daiben increased by 6 mortars, 8 mountain guns, 8 other guns, 48 light machine guns, 50 submachine guns, and 200 rifles; the Third Daiben increased by 14 other guns, 4 heavy machine guns, 20 light machine guns, and 32 submachine guns; the Fourth Daiben increased by 1 heavy machine gun, 6 light machine guns, 15 submachine guns, and 100 rifles; the Fifth Daiben increased by 25 rifles; and the Sixth Daiben increased by 2 mortars, 6 light machine guns, and 1 submachine gun. In total, they increased by 16 mortars, 8 mountain guns, 22 other guns, 5 heavy machine guns, 124 light machine guns, 298 submachine guns, and 625 rifles. The equipment has more than doubled in the past four years.

In order to refuse to reorganize the Tibetan army, the former Tibetan local government convened a "representative meeting" of middle and senior officers of the six Daiben in 1956, specifically to discuss concrete measures to resist the Central People's Government. The "representative meeting," under the auspices of the former Tibetan local government, also passed a "declaration" to prepare and incite rebellion. This "declaration" stated, "Recently, under the pretext of so-called agreements and benefits to Tibet, many reforms are to be carried out in Tibet (Note: refers to the request for democratic reforms put forward by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni at the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region in April 1956)," with the aim of "destroying all the good old systems," "Therefore, the Ruben (equivalent to battalion commander) and Jiaben (equivalent to company commander) of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Daiben were convened to conduct detailed discussions over several days, with politics and religion as the priority." The "declaration" then proposed: "There should be no division among our officers and soldiers. If necessary, entrust the destiny of previous lives. All barracks should not leak information. Regardless of internal or external matters, we must disregard sacrifice, be single-minded, share weal and woe, and never violate the oath."

Under the manipulation of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, the Tibetan army has always been at the forefront of attacks against the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. Last year, the Tibetan army had already organized several times to block and rob the People's Liberation Army, attack PLA sentry posts, illegally arrest Han Chinese workers, and fire shots at the central government's organizations in Tibet in protest. During gatherings and drills, the Tibetan army even arrogantly raised the reactionary so-called "Snow Lion Flag" of "Independent Tibet" and shouted reactionary slogans such as "Tibet independence, drive out the Han people."

When a small number of rebels in the former Xikang region and Qinghai began armed riots within Tibet, in addition to planning for the rebels' food and accommodation and arranging territory, the former Tibetan local government also continuously transferred artillerymen, machine gunners, buglers, and some junior officers from the Tibetan army, carrying weapons to replenish the rebel ranks, most of whom later became the backbone of the rebels. According to incomplete statistics, in the latter half of last year, the Second Daiben stationed in the Lhasa area transferred 258 people to the rebels, the Fourth Daiben transferred 37 people, the First Daiben transferred 9 people, and the Sixth Daiben transferred 8 people, totaling 312 people replenished for the rebels.

The Tibetan army is also a thoroughly corrupt army, consistently oppressing the people and committing all kinds of evil. The Tibetan people compare the Tibetan army to a large mountain pressing down on them, and they all hate them with gnashing teeth. Under the rule of the former Tibetan local government, this army never resisted foreign aggression but loyally protected the interests of the serf owners and harmed the Tibetan people. They spent their days drinking, fighting, gambling, and engaging in prostitution, with all food, drink, and expenses entirely supplied by the people in the garrison area. If they were slightly dissatisfied, they would beat and scold people. The Tibetan people also had to bear the extremely heavy "Ula" (corvée labor) dispatched by the Tibetan army. Each person below the Zubon (squad leader) could receive one to three head of cattle, the "Xieao" (platoon leader) received three horses and four head of cattle, the "Ruben" (battalion commander) received eight horses and twelve head of cattle, and the "Daiben" (regiment commander) received twelve horses and twenty head of cattle. Every time the Tibetan army rotated its defense, it was followed by a huge Ula team. Although the Tibetan army with its own horses did not actually need Ula, it always converted the prescribed number of Ula into cash paid by the farmers. The Tibetan army could even casually hang a horsewhip in front of the house of a Tibetan woman they had taken a fancy to, and the head of that household would have to send the young woman in the family, along with the horsewhip, to the Tibetan army's residence, to be raped by the Tibetan army.

The Tibetan army has close ties with imperialism. The Tibetan army's full equipment was supplied by British imperialism and other imperialists. The Tibetan army's regulations and tactics were British-style, and even officers issued various commands in English. The senior officers who ruled the Tibetan army were mostly trained by British imperialism and other foreign reactionaries. They were wholeheartedly willing to act as pawns for imperialism. The "Maji" of the Tibetan army, Keimo Soan Wangdui (rebel leader), was a running dog cultivated by British imperialism. He was the uncle of Soikang Wangqing Gele, the main planner of the rebellion, and one of the great serf owners in Tibet. He received British military training at a young age, served as a receptionist for the British imperialist office in Tibet after 1938, and led the so-called "Goodwill Mission" to India in 1945 to conduct traitorous activities. In 1950, when the People's Liberation Army was ordered to march into Tibet, Keimo Soan Wangdui also tried his best to force the Dalai Lama to flee to India. In early 1955, Keimo Soan Wangdui appointed more than 20 trusted Tibetan soldiers to form a secret organization to specifically monitor the actions of patriotic progressives and officials who had visited the mainland for study.

From January of this year, under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, the Tibetan army more rampantly carried out activities to betray the motherland. On February 14th, the Tibetan army arrested two employees of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureau and put them in shackles and handcuffs for seven days and nights, attempting to create an excuse to launch a full-scale rebellion in the name of protecting the Dalai Lama's safety. They were only released after strict reprimands and repeated negotiations by the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tibet Military Region. After February 21st, the Tibetan army repeatedly set up machine guns at the entrance and surrounding areas of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the central government's organizations in Lhasa to provoke.

Under the command and planning of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, the reactionary nature of this army, which has consistently oppressed the people, has not changed in the past eight years, and it finally launched a full-scale attack on our People's Liberation Army and the central government's organizations in Lhasa on the night of March 19th, openly embarking on the criminal path of betraying the motherland.

    原西藏地方政府是怎样破坏改编藏军的协议的
    新华社记者　郭超人
    5月23日是中央人民政府和原西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议签订八周年。这一协议从1951年签订以来，西藏上层反动集团和原西藏地方政府中的反动分子就百般进行阻挠和破坏，使这一协议中的许多重要条款，没有能够实现。例如，协议第八条规定“西藏军队逐步改编为人民解放军，成为中华人民共和国国防武装的一部分”，但是八年来这支军队不仅根本没有改编，而且原西藏地方政府还在兵员和装备上非法地进行了扩充，把这一支军队用来作为反对中央人民政府和人民解放军的工具。
    旧藏军的总负责人称作“马基”（总司令），“马基”办公处称作“马基康”（司令部），下分六个“代本”（每个代本大小不一，一般相当于团的建制）。1951年西藏和平解放时六个代本的官兵总共不过一千四百多人。但是原西藏地方政府八年来竟将这支军队扩充了一倍以上。现在查明，在1952年6月，据不完全统计，原西藏地方政府一次就征集了五百人，将在昌都战役中被人民解放军歼灭的三代本重新恢复。1956年，原西康地区进行民主改革以后，一小撮农奴主发动武装叛乱，原西藏地方政府也在这时候大肆征兵。从1956年下半年，一代本增加了二百五十多人，二代本增加了二百五十多人，三代本增加了二百四十人，共计增加七百四十多人，1957年，一代本又增加二百人，二代本和三代本各增加三百人，四代本增加一百人，共计增加九百人左右。1958年五代本又增加二百五十多人。除去逃亡的士兵外，直到今年3月10日前为止，藏军总数超过了三千人。
    与此同时，原西藏地方政府还不断从国外运进军火，其中大部分是自动武器和重型武器。如果以1954年藏军的装备和1958年的装备进行比较，则一代本增加迫击炮八门，增加轻机枪四十四挺，冲锋枪二百支，步枪三百支；二代本增加迫击炮六门，山炮八门，其他炮八门，轻机枪四十八挺，冲锋枪五十支，步枪二百支；三代本则增加了其他炮十四门，重机枪四挺，轻机枪二十挺，冲锋枪三十二支；四代本增加重机枪一挺，轻机枪六挺，冲锋枪十五支，步枪一百支；五代本增加步枪二十五支；六代本增加迫击炮二门，轻机枪六挺，冲锋枪一支。合计增加迫击炮十六门，山炮八门，其他炮二十二门，重机枪五挺，轻机枪一百二十四挺，冲锋枪二百九十八支，步枪六百二十五支。四年来共增加装备一倍多。
    为了拒绝改编藏军，原西藏地方政府在1956年竟召集了六个代本的中上级军官，秘密举行“代表会议”，专门讨论如何向中央人民政府进行顽抗的具体措施。“代表会议”在原西藏地方政府主持下还通过了一份准备和煽动叛乱的“宣誓书”。这份“宣誓书”说，“近来用所谓根据协议及对西藏有好处为借口，要对西藏进行很多的改革（注：指1956年4月达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在自治区筹备委员会成立大会上提出要求进行民主改革）”，其目的是要“毁灭旧有的一切良好制度”，“因而召集了一二三四五六代本的如本（按：相当于营长）和甲本（按：相当于连长），以政教为重，用数天时间，进行详细的讨论”。“宣誓书”接着提出：“我们官兵之间不应该有所分裂，必要时许诸前世的命定，各兵营不要走漏风声，不管对内对外，都要不顾牺牲，一心一意，同舟共难，永不违反誓言。”
    在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的操纵下，藏军一直是向中央人民政府和人民解放军进攻的急先锋。在去年，藏军已经有组织地几次拦路阻劫解放军，袭击解放军岗哨，非法逮捕汉族工作人员，向中央驻西藏机关鸣枪示威。在集会和出操时，藏军甚至狂妄地升挂反动的所谓“西藏独立国”的“雪山狮子旗”，呼喊“西藏独立，赶走汉人”等反动口号。
    当原西康地区和青海的少数叛乱分子在西藏境内开始武装暴乱以后，原西藏地方政府除为叛匪筹划粮草，安排地盘外，还不断从藏军中抽调炮手、机枪手、号手和一部分下级军官，携带武器充实叛匪队伍，这些人后来大都成为叛匪中的骨干分子。据不完全统计，在去年后半年中，驻扎在拉萨地区的二代本即为叛匪调去二百五十八人，四代本调去三十七人，一代本调去九人，六代本调去八人，共计为叛匪补充了三百一十二人。
    藏军又是一支腐败透顶、一贯欺压人民、无恶不作的军队，西藏人民把藏军比作压在他们身上的一座大山，无不切齿痛恨。这支军队在原西藏地方政府统治下，从不抗御外侮，却忠诚地保护农奴主的利益，残害西藏人民。他们整天酗酒打闹、嫖赌玩乐，一切吃喝用度，完全由驻地人民供应，稍不如意，就打人骂人。西藏人民还要负担藏军支派的极其沉重的“乌拉”（差役），足本（班长）以下的每人可以支一至三头牛，“协敖”（排长）支三匹马、四头牛，“如本”（营长）支八匹马、十二头牛，“代本”（团长）支十二匹马、二十头牛。每一次藏军换防时，后面都跟着一支庞大的乌拉队伍。自己带有马匹的藏军虽然实际上并不需要乌拉，但每次都把规定的乌拉数目由农民折成现金偿付。藏军甚至可以随意把马鞭挂在他看中的藏族妇女的家门前，这户人家的家长就得把家里的青年妇女连同马鞭一起送到藏军的住处，任凭藏军奸污。
    藏军和帝国主义有千丝万缕的联系。西藏军队的全副装备是英帝国主义及其他帝国主义供给的，藏军的操典和战术是英国式的，甚至军官发布各种口令都是用英语。统治西藏军队的高级军官，大都是英帝国主义和其他外国反动派训练出来的，他们忠心耿耿地甘愿为帝国主义充当走卒。藏军的“马基”凯墨·索安旺堆（叛匪首脑）便是英帝国主义一手培养起来的走狗，他是叛乱的主要策划者索康·旺清格勒的叔父，西藏大农奴主之一。年青时便受过英国的军事训练，1938年以后担任英帝驻西藏办事处的招待官，1945年又率领所谓的“亲善团”到印度进行叛国活动。1950年当人民解放军奉命进军西藏时，凯墨·索安旺堆又竭力强迫达赖喇嘛往印度逃跑。1955年初，凯墨·索安旺堆曾指派心腹藏兵二十多人组成秘密组织，专门监视爱国进步人士和曾去内地参观学习的官员们的行动。
    从今年1月起，原西藏地方政府在帝国主义和外国反动派的指使下，藏军更加猖狂地进行背叛祖国的活动。2月14日，藏军将我青藏公路局职工二人捉去，戴上脚镣手铐监押了七昼夜，企图以保卫达赖喇嘛的安全为名制造发动全面叛乱的借口，经中共西藏工委和西藏军区严格指责和反复交涉才放回。2月21日以后，藏军数次在中共西藏工委和中央驻拉萨机关的大门口和周围地带架设机枪进行挑衅。
    在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的指挥、策划下，这支一贯欺压人民的军队八年来反动的性质毫无改变，并且终于在3月19日夜间向我人民解放军和中央驻拉萨机关发动了全面进攻，公开走上了背叛祖国的罪恶道路。
