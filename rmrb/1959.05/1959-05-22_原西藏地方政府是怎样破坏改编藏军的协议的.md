How the Former Tibetan Local Government Sabotaged the Agreement on Reorganizing the Tibetan Army
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Guo Chaoren

May 23rd marks the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet between the Central People's Government and the former Tibetan local government. Since the signing of this agreement in 1951, the reactionary clique of the Tibetan upper class and the reactionaries in the former Tibetan local government have tried every possible means to obstruct and sabotage it, so that many important clauses of this agreement have not been realized. For example, Article 8 of the agreement stipulates that "the Tibetan army shall be reorganized step by step into the People's Liberation Army and become a part of the national defense armed forces of the People's Republic of China." However, in the past eight years, not only has this army not been reorganized at all, but the former Tibetan local government has also illegally expanded it in terms of manpower and equipment, using this army as a tool to oppose the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army.

The overall person in charge of the old Tibetan army was called "Maji" (Commander-in-Chief), and the "Maji" office was called "Maji Kang" (Headquarters), which was divided into six "Daiben" (each Daiben varied in size, generally equivalent to a regiment). In 1951, when Tibet was peacefully liberated, the total number of officers and soldiers in the six Daiben was only over 1,400. However, in the past eight years, the former Tibetan local government has expanded this army by more than double. It is now verified that in June 1952, according to incomplete statistics, the former Tibetan local government conscripted 500 people in one go to restore the Third Daiben, which had been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Qamdo Campaign. After the democratic reforms in the former Xikang region in 1956, a small number of serf owners launched an armed rebellion, and the former Tibetan local government also conscripted troops on a large scale at this time. From the second half of 1956, the First Daiben increased by more than 250 people, the Second Daiben increased by more than 250 people, and the Third Daiben increased by 240 people, totaling more than 740 people. In 1957, the First Daiben increased by another 200 people, the Second and Third Daiben each increased by 300 people, and the Fourth Daiben increased by 100 people, totaling about 900 people. In 1958, the Fifth Daiben increased by more than 250 people. Excluding the soldiers who fled, the total number of Tibetan troops exceeded 3,000 until before March 10th this year.

At the same time, the former Tibetan local government also continuously imported military supplies from abroad, most of which were automatic weapons and heavy weapons. If we compare the equipment of the Tibetan army in 1954 with the equipment in 1958, the First Daiben increased by 8 mortars, 44 light machine guns, 200 submachine guns, and 300 rifles; the Second Daiben increased by 6 mortars, 8 mountain guns, 8 other guns, 48 light machine guns, 50 submachine guns, and 200 rifles; the Third Daiben increased by 14 other guns, 4 heavy machine guns, 20 light machine guns, and 32 submachine guns; the Fourth Daiben increased by 1 heavy machine gun, 6 light machine guns, 15 submachine guns, and 100 rifles; the Fifth Daiben increased by 25 rifles; and the Sixth Daiben increased by 2 mortars, 6 light machine guns, and 1 submachine gun. In total, they increased by 16 mortars, 8 mountain guns, 22 other guns, 5 heavy machine guns, 124 light machine guns, 298 submachine guns, and 625 rifles. The equipment has more than doubled in the past four years.

In order to refuse to reorganize the Tibetan army, the former Tibetan local government convened a "representative meeting" of middle and senior officers of the six Daiben in 1956, specifically to discuss concrete measures to resist the Central People's Government. The "representative meeting," under the auspices of the former Tibetan local government, also passed a "declaration" to prepare and incite rebellion. This "declaration" stated, "Recently, under the pretext of so-called agreements and benefits to Tibet, many reforms are to be carried out in Tibet (Note: refers to the request for democratic reforms put forward by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni at the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region in April 1956)," with the aim of "destroying all the good old systems," "Therefore, the Ruben (equivalent to battalion commander) and Jiaben (equivalent to company commander) of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Daiben were convened to conduct detailed discussions over several days, with politics and religion as the priority." The "declaration" then proposed: "There should be no division among our officers and soldiers. If necessary, entrust the destiny of previous lives. All barracks should not leak information. Regardless of internal or external matters, we must disregard sacrifice, be single-minded, share weal and woe, and never violate the oath."

Under the manipulation of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, the Tibetan army has always been at the forefront of attacks against the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. Last year, the Tibetan army had already organized several times to block and rob the People's Liberation Army, attack PLA sentry posts, illegally arrest Han Chinese workers, and fire shots at the central government's organizations in Tibet in protest. During gatherings and drills, the Tibetan army even arrogantly raised the reactionary so-called "Snow Lion Flag" of "Independent Tibet" and shouted reactionary slogans such as "Tibet independence, drive out the Han people."

When a small number of rebels in the former Xikang region and Qinghai began armed riots within Tibet, in addition to planning for the rebels' food and accommodation and arranging territory, the former Tibetan local government also continuously transferred artillerymen, machine gunners, buglers, and some junior officers from the Tibetan army, carrying weapons to replenish the rebel ranks, most of whom later became the backbone of the rebels. According to incomplete statistics, in the latter half of last year, the Second Daiben stationed in the Lhasa area transferred 258 people to the rebels, the Fourth Daiben transferred 37 people, the First Daiben transferred 9 people, and the Sixth Daiben transferred 8 people, totaling 312 people replenished for the rebels.

The Tibetan army is also a thoroughly corrupt army, consistently oppressing the people and committing all kinds of evil. The Tibetan people compare the Tibetan army to a large mountain pressing down on them, and they all hate them with gnashing teeth. Under the rule of the former Tibetan local government, this army never resisted foreign aggression but loyally protected the interests of the serf owners and harmed the Tibetan people. They spent their days drinking, fighting, gambling, and engaging in prostitution, with all food, drink, and expenses entirely supplied by the people in the garrison area. If they were slightly dissatisfied, they would beat and scold people. The Tibetan people also had to bear the extremely heavy "Ula" (corv√©e labor) dispatched by the Tibetan army. Each person below the Zubon (squad leader) could receive one to three head of cattle, the "Xieao" (platoon leader) received three horses and four head of cattle, the "Ruben" (battalion commander) received eight horses and twelve head of cattle, and the "Daiben" (regiment commander) received twelve horses and twenty head of cattle. Every time the Tibetan army rotated its defense, it was followed by a huge Ula team. Although the Tibetan army with its own horses did not actually need Ula, it always converted the prescribed number of Ula into cash paid by the farmers. The Tibetan army could even casually hang a horsewhip in front of the house of a Tibetan woman they had taken a fancy to, and the head of that household would have to send the young woman in the family, along with the horsewhip, to the Tibetan army's residence, to be raped by the Tibetan army.

The Tibetan army has close ties with imperialism. The Tibetan army's full equipment was supplied by British imperialism and other imperialists. The Tibetan army's regulations and tactics were British-style, and even officers issued various commands in English. The senior officers who ruled the Tibetan army were mostly trained by British imperialism and other foreign reactionaries. They were wholeheartedly willing to act as pawns for imperialism. The "Maji" of the Tibetan army, Keimo Soan Wangdui (rebel leader), was a running dog cultivated by British imperialism. He was the uncle of Soikang Wangqing Gele, the main planner of the rebellion, and one of the great serf owners in Tibet. He received British military training at a young age, served as a receptionist for the British imperialist office in Tibet after 1938, and led the so-called "Goodwill Mission" to India in 1945 to conduct traitorous activities. In 1950, when the People's Liberation Army was ordered to march into Tibet, Keimo Soan Wangdui also tried his best to force the Dalai Lama to flee to India. In early 1955, Keimo Soan Wangdui appointed more than 20 trusted Tibetan soldiers to form a secret organization to specifically monitor the actions of patriotic progressives and officials who had visited the mainland for study.

From January of this year, under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, the Tibetan army more rampantly carried out activities to betray the motherland. On February 14th, the Tibetan army arrested two employees of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureau and put them in shackles and handcuffs for seven days and nights, attempting to create an excuse to launch a full-scale rebellion in the name of protecting the Dalai Lama's safety. They were only released after strict reprimands and repeated negotiations by the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tibet Military Region. After February 21st, the Tibetan army repeatedly set up machine guns at the entrance and surrounding areas of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the central government's organizations in Lhasa to provoke.

Under the command and planning of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, the reactionary nature of this army, which has consistently oppressed the people, has not changed in the past eight years, and it finally launched a full-scale attack on our People's Liberation Army and the central government's organizations in Lhasa on the night of March 19th, openly embarking on the criminal path of betraying the motherland.
