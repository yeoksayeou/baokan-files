Only in the Great Family of the Motherland Can We Be Reborn

Representative Ma Yong Speaks on the Changes in the Dongxiang Autonomous County

Fellow Representatives:

I fully agree with and support the Government Work Report by Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Our great motherland is a unified country composed of many ethnic groups. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups have embarked on a path of common prosperity and happiness, and have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements. From our own experiences, we, the Dongxiang people, deeply feel that only in the great family of the motherland, where all ethnic groups are equal, united, friendly, and mutually helpful, can we be reborn. However, just as the people of all ethnic groups were advancing with confidence and magnificent strides, the former local government of Tibet and the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, in defiance of the will of the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Tibetan people, colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to openly carry out a rebellion, undermine the unification of the motherland and the unity of the nationalities, and tear up the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, attempting to maintain their bloody rule over Tibet and keep the vast Tibetan people in a state of misery forever. This kind of criminal behavior is absolutely intolerable to the people of all ethnic groups. The unification of the motherland is the common highest interest of all ethnic groups, and safeguarding the unification of the motherland and the unity of the nationalities is the sacred duty of the people of all ethnic groups. We, the Dongxiang people, wholeheartedly support the central government's policy and measures to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. And together with all fraternal ethnic groups, we will closely unite around the Party and the People's Government, and dedicate all our strength to the bright future of the great family of the motherland.

We, the people of all ethnic groups, fully understand that the fate of our own ethnic group is closely related to the fate of all fraternal ethnic groups. Without the common and supreme interest of the unification of the motherland, there can be no talk of the interests of any one ethnic group. In the years when we suffered from imperialist aggression and reactionary rule, the people of all ethnic groups in our country, especially the people of the minority nationalities, lived a life of poverty and suffering and were subjected to all kinds of torture. Take our Dongxiang people as an example. We live in a barren mountainous area in Gansu Province, more than 2,600 meters above sea level, with bare mountains and ridges, and crisscrossing gullies, with only 300 millimeters of rainfall a year. Before liberation, out of more than 420,000 mu of cultivated land, there were only 6,000 mu of irrigated land, and we were threatened by drought year after year. "High mountains and deep gullies, bald hills, steep slopes and floods, hoping to get rich year after year, but nine out of ten crops fail," this was a true depiction of our Dongxiang area at that time. In such a harsh environment, what did the reactionary rulers give to our Dongxiang people? Besides exorbitant taxes and levies, there was national oppression and discrimination. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and with the help of all fraternal ethnic groups, especially the Han nationality, we diverted river water to the high mountains, built more than 120,000 mu of irrigated land, planted more than one million mu of trees, and controlled soil erosion over an area of more than 1,200 square kilometers, fundamentally changing the face of drought. In the past, we labored like cattle and horses all year round and could not get enough to eat; now, we not only have enough grain to eat and use, but also have a surplus. Not only that, but in the past, there were few literate people among the entire Dongxiang people. Now, we have more than 200 primary schools, as well as middle schools and normal schools. Ninety-six percent of school-age children are enrolled, and eighty percent of young and middle-aged people have become literate. In particular, more than 600 factories of various kinds have been set up in Dongxiang, which was once a wilderness. We have our own industry and our own working class. Hospitals, theaters, highways, cars, electric lights, and telephones, which we never dared to imagine in the past, are now all available. We, the Dongxiang nationality, have always been a ruled and oppressed nationality. Now, under the brilliant light of the Party's policy on nationalities, and under the unified leadership of the motherland, we have implemented national regional autonomy and established the Dongxiang Autonomous County. We have truly become masters of our own house. Although the population of our Dongxiang nationality is small, we are equally respected and loved by all fraternal nationalities, especially the Han people. A new relationship of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation has been established among all ethnic groups. Since then, we, the Dongxiang people, have been freed from darkness and suffering and have found light and happiness. Are all these facts not enough to show the warmth, loveliness, and preciousness of the unified family of the motherland? From the lessons of historical facts, we, the people of all ethnic groups, have clearly understood who is the true protector of national interests and who is the betrayer of national interests. The conspiracy of those who pretend to "protect national interests" and clamor for "Tibetan independence" has been completely bankrupt. True national regional autonomy is about to be realized in Tibet soon. This is the broad road to socialism chosen by the Tibetan people themselves, and no force can stop it.

The era in which the Chinese people were at the mercy of others has long passed. The common destiny of all ethnic groups has united us more closely. The rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion marks the great victory of the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups. If imperialism and all reactionaries dare to extend their claws to us, we will surely chop them off.

　　在祖国大家庭里才能得到新生
　　马泳代表谈东乡族自治县的变化各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    我们伟大的祖国，是一个多民族组成的统一的国家。各民族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，已经走上共同繁荣的幸福道路，取得了史无前例的辉煌成就。我们东乡族人民从亲身经历中，深切感到只有在各民族平等、团结、友爱、互助的祖国大家庭里才能得到新生。但是，正当各民族人民满怀信心，以雄伟的步伐向前迈进的时候，原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团，竟违背各民族人民首先是西藏人民的意志，勾结帝国主义、蒋匪帮和外国反动派公开进行叛乱，破坏祖国统一和民族团结，撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，企图保持他们对西藏的血腥统治，使西藏广大人民永远处于水深火热的境地。这种罪恶行为，是各民族人民断然不能容忍的。祖国的统一，是各民族共同的最高利益，维护祖国统一和民族团结，是各民族人民的神圣职责。我们东乡族人民衷心拥护中央人民政府彻底平息西藏叛乱的方针和措施。并且同各兄弟民族一起，紧密地团结在党和人民政府的周围，为祖国大家庭美好的未来献出一切力量。
    我们各民族人民完全懂得，自己民族的命运是与各兄弟民族的命运休戚相关、紧密相连的。离开祖国统一这个共同的最高的利益，就谈不到任何一个民族的利益。在遭受帝国主义侵略和反动派统治的岁月里，我国各民族人民特别是各少数民族人民，过着贫困痛苦的生活，受尽了折磨。就以我们东乡族人民来说，聚居在甘肃省的一个贫瘠山区，拔海两千六百多公尺，光山秃岭，沟壑纵横，一年只有三百公厘的降雨量。解放前，在四十二万多亩耕地中只有六千来亩水地，连年受着干旱的威胁。“山高沟深和尚头，崖高地陡洪水流，一年盼着一年富，十种九不收”，这就是当时我们东乡地区的写照。在这样艰苦的环境里，反动统治者给我们东乡人民的是什么呢？除了苛捐杂税，就是民族压迫和歧视。解放以后，在党和人民政府领导下，在各兄弟民族尤其是汉族的帮助下，我们把河水引上了高山，兴修水地十二万多亩，植树造林一百多万亩，控制水土流失面积一千二百多平方公里，从根本上改变了干旱面貌。过去，我们终年像牛马一样的劳动，得不到温饱；现在，我们的粮食不仅够吃够用，而且有了富余。不仅如此，过去全东乡人民没有几个识字的，现在，我们有了二百多所小学，还有中学和师范，百分之九十六的学龄儿童入了学，百分之八十的青壮年脱了盲。特别是在过去一片山野的东乡办起了六百多个各种工厂，有了自己的工业和本民族的工人阶级。过去想也想不到的医院、剧院、公路、汽车、电灯、电话，现在样样俱全了。我们东乡民族，一向是被统治被压迫的民族，现在，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，在祖国统一领导之下，我们实行了民族地方自治，建立了东乡族自治县，我们真正当了家、作了主人。虽然我们东乡族人口很少，但是我们同样受到各兄弟民族特别是汉族人民的尊重和爱戴，各民族之间建立了平等、团结、互助、合作的新关系。从此我们东乡人民摆脱了黑暗和痛苦，找到了光明和幸福。所有这些事实，还不足以说明统一的祖国大家庭的温暖可爱和难能可贵吗？我们各民族人民从历史事实的教训中，已经清楚地知道，谁是民族利益的真正保护者，谁是民族利益的出卖者。那些伪装“保护民族利益”，叫嚷“西藏独立”的阴谋，已经彻底破产了，真正的民族地方自治倒是很快地要在西藏实现。这是西藏人民自己选择的走向社会主义的康庄大道，任何力量都是挡不住的。
    我们中国人民任人宰割的时代早已过去了，各民族的共同命运更加紧密地把我们团结在一起。西藏叛乱的迅速平息，就标志着各民族人民大团结的伟大胜利。帝国主义和一切反动派如果胆敢向我们伸出魔爪，我们一定把它斩断。
