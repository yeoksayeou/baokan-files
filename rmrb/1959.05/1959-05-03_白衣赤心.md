    White Coat, Red Heart
    Bai Nationality, Nà Jiālún

    The morning sun shines on the hospital roof, painting the blue tiles with fiery red colors. The dawn in the ward is quiet, the patients still in their dreams.

    On this very morning, Little Yang, you come to the ward for the first time, with an excited and joyful heart, to realize your beautiful ideal.

    "An ideal, as long as it takes root and sprouts in one's heart, no one can pull it out!" You said this, and it shows your strong character. When you decided to apply to nursing school, your female companion pointed at your nose: "Look how silly you are, you should take the high school exam, so you can go to university in the future! Hmph, go to nursing school, to serve people your whole life!" Hearing these words, you felt wronged. But the words of your father, who had been a mailman for more than ten years, deeply moved your heart: "It is serving people. Serving people is a glorious career! Every day I deliver letters to people's hands, they thank me, love me, and see me as someone close to them. Who are we serving? We are serving the masters of socialist construction!" Thus, you firmly stepped into the gate of the nursing school. Two years passed in the blink of an eye. Now, you stand in the center of the ward with a grade report full of fives in your arms, wearing a slightly long white coat, with a heart full of trepidation, welcoming the surprised gazes from every bed. "Comrades, I am, I am a new intern nurse, please help me a lot!"

    The new life began like this. Pouring urine, washing bedpans, mopping floors, feeding, covering blankets, giving injections... you rushed to do everything, and if the patients liked it, you would even sing a passage out loud. You felt how right your father's words were, and like him: you received people's gratitude, love, and closeness.

    One day, a comatose lieutenant from the frontier guard was sent in. In order to defend the sacred motherland, he was injured in a fight with bandits, and blood flowed from his blood vessels like a spring. Rescuing him! Transfusing blood! Little Yang, you, who had just gotten off work, were the first to hold out your arm, standing by the bed and refusing to leave, your 700 CC of fresh blood flowing into the lieutenant's heart, allowing it to continue beating. 700 CC, how precious it is to you, a girl who is not very strong! But you did not hesitate, without even thinking an extra thought.

    You also had your troubles. The leader transferred you to the pediatric department, and you were extremely happy: "I want to be with the lovely successors of communism!" But realizing beautiful wishes is never easy. In the first week, you encountered difficulties: the children didn't like you, they were afraid of you, and when you walked into the ward, those little heads would shrink into the quilt and cry softly. Because your injections were always so painful. At the League branch meeting, you shed tears, not out of timidity, but because you hated yourself for not having learned injections well in school. The comrades' words became your determination: Study, difficult things are only feared by those who don't put their heart into it!

    It began! Day and night, holidays, you learned from and consulted with experienced nurses; sometimes you even used your own arms as experiments!

    Those who sow diligently always reap a good harvest. On a bright morning, many colleagues came to see your "painless injection" performance. Holding a toy to amuse the children in your hand, with an innocent smile on your face, you walked into the ward, first using the toy to arouse the children's interest, and then giving them each an imperceptible injection. A miracle, the children no longer cried, and the ward was filled with spring-like laughter.

    On that very morning, I asked you: "What are you thinking now?" "Thinking about being unemployed!" I couldn't understand your meaningful answer for a moment. You smiled, a smile as crisp as the sound of a pigeon whistle in the clear sky, "If there are no patients in the world, wouldn't we be unemployed? I think that day will definitely come. If it really could be like that, how good would that be!"

    白衣赤心
    白族　那家伦
    朝阳，照射着医院的屋顶，给一块块青瓦涂上了火红的颜色。病房的黎明是静静的，病人们还在梦乡。
    就在这个早晨，小杨，你初次来到病房，怀着一颗激动而又快活的心，来实现自己美丽的理想。
    “理想，只要在自己心里生根发芽，那就任谁也不能把它拔掉！”这句话是你说的，它也表明了你坚强的性格。当你决定投考护校时，你的女伴曾点着你的鼻子：“瞧你多傻，这会考高中，将来可以升大学嘛！哼，考护校，去侍候人一辈子！”听着这些话，你感到委屈。但那干了十几年邮递员的父亲的话深深地打动了你的心：“就是侍候人。侍候人是光荣的事业！我每天把信送到人们手里，他们感激我、爱戴我、把我看成亲近的人。我们是在侍候谁呢？是在侍候建设社会主义的主人！”就这样，你坚定地跨进了护校的大门。两年一眨眼就过去了。这会，你怀里揣着全是五分的成绩单，穿着一件稍觉长了点的白衣服，怀着一颗忐忑的心站在病房中央，用你那清澈的眼睛，迎接着从每张病床上投来的惊诧的目光。“同志们，我是，我是新来的实习护士，请你们多多帮助！”。
    新的生活就这样开始了。倒尿、洗大便盆、拖地板、喂饭、盖被、打针……你样样都抢着干，只要病人喜欢，你还要放开嗓子唱上一段。你感觉到父亲的话是多么正确，你像他一样：受到了人们的感激、爱戴和亲近。
    这天，送来一个昏迷的边防军少尉。为了保卫神圣的祖国，他在和匪徒搏斗时受了伤，鲜血从血管里像泉水般淌出来。要抢救！要输血！小杨，这时刚下班的你第一个伸出胳膊，站在病床旁死也不肯走，你那七百CC鲜血流进了少尉的心脏，让它没有停止跳动。七百CC，对你这个体质不算强壮的女孩子是多么宝贵啊！但你毫不犹豫，连多余的念头都没想一想。
    你也有过苦恼。领导调你到小儿科去，你高兴极了：“我要和可爱的共产主义接班人在一起了！”可是实现美好的愿望总不是容易的。第一个星期你就遭遇到困难：孩子们不喜欢你，怕你，当你一走进病房，那些小脑袋就缩到被里去，低声哭起来。因为你打针总是那样疼。在团小组会上，你流泪了，倒不是胆怯，而是恨自己在学校里为什么不把注射学好。同志们的话变成你的决心：学吧，难事就怕用心人！
    开始了！白天，深夜，假日，你向有经验的护士学习着、请教着；有时你甚至用自己的手臂作试验！
    勤于播种的人总是有好收获的。在一个灿烂的早晨，很多同行来参观你的“无痛注射”表演。你手里抱着逗引孩子的玩具，脸上带着天真的笑容走进病房，先用玩具逗起了孩子的兴趣，再给他们一个个进行不知不觉的注射。奇迹，孩子们不再哭泣，病房里是一片春天样的笑声。
    就在那天早晨，我问你：“你现在想什么？”“想失业！”我一时理解不了你这意味深长的回答。你笑了，笑得像晴空中传来的鸽哨一样轻脆，“如果世界上都没有病人，我们不是失业了吗？我想这一天一定会到来的。如果真能这样，该有多好呵！”
