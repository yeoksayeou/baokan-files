    Popular Inspectors
    Xie Gong
    The assembly inspection team of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory is an inspection team that is production-oriented and connects with the masses. They inspect and produce simultaneously, proactively cooperating with workshops to solve problems, and have been well received and welcomed by the workers. All eight members of the team have been praised by the workers, who commend them for "both conducting inspections and engaging in production; both completing tasks and training apprentices." Workers even call inspectors Wu Changhong and Wang Shouyi "Red Inspectors."
    Why are they able to receive such high praise?
    "Inspecting while producing" is a new working method they have adopted since the Great Leap Forward. They focus on inspection and participate in production while doing a good job of inspection. They inspect when there are inspection tasks, and produce when there are none. Workers welcome this approach, saying that "before, they just pointed fingers; now, they work hard and cleverly with us."
    By adopting the method of inspecting while producing, they have mastered and understood the internal structure of the machines, which facilitates inspection work and ensures product quality. For example, if a machine is missing parts, the inspectors proactively install them; if something is installed incorrectly, they proactively correct it; if there are any unqualified areas, they repair them themselves... In short, they do whatever they can, truly acting as both inspectors and producers.
    The characteristic of their inspection work is that they proactively discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, preventing the generation of defective products. There are two ways to find problems: one is to find problems in the drawings through data digestion; the other is to find practical problems through production. Before production, they digest the drawings, especially the drawings of new products, which they digest repeatedly. In this way, they not only master the performance and mechanism of the machine, but also can find errors in the drawings, which plays a significant role in preventing defective products. Inspectors Wang Shouyi and Wu Changhong discovered design errors in the drawings of the transfer machine reducer through data digestion, reported them to the design department, and the errors were immediately corrected. In production, they compare the drawings with the actual objects to find problems, and when they find problems such as inflexible mechanisms and improper fit, they try to solve them.
    They not only proactively find problems, but more importantly, they can solve them in a timely manner. For example, inspector Zhou Zizhen discovered that when the rock loading machine box was cast, the gas path was blocked due to the core joint being too large, so he immediately informed the casting workshop, preventing the production of a large number of defective products.
    When production encounters technical bottlenecks, especially the technical bottlenecks of new products, they proactively assist the workshop, try every means to improve tools, improve operations, and work hard and cleverly with the workers until the bottlenecks are overcome. Inspector He Changxing found that the sealing rings for lubrication equipment were cut with a small knife, resulting in poor quality and low efficiency, which became an obstacle to completing the task. He worked hard and researched, and finally converted a discarded saw blade into a toothless saw, increasing efficiency eight times. When encountering difficulties in the trial production of the friction press oil pump, he and the workers searched for problems day and night, personally repaired, personally assembled, and personally tested, and finally found the problem, enabling the oil pump to be trial-produced as soon as possible. Inspector Wu Zhen found that the 20-type drilling machine often had problems during trial operation, either this was wrong or that was wrong. Based on these problems, he found out the things that needed attention during assembly, ensuring the success of the trial operation.
    Most of the inspectors are senior craftsmen, and they have also digested the data beforehand, so they have a relatively good understanding of the structure and performance of the machines, which gives them the conditions for technical guidance. They often demonstrate and explain to junior craftsmen and apprentices what parts of the machine are precise, what parts are rough, what parts are the key, what parts are general, and the function of various parts and components... In addition to regularly guiding general apprentices, inspector He Changxing also specifically trained two apprentices, enabling them to learn how to assemble products such as reducers. Inspector Li Guiyuan specifically took four apprentices, and in addition to guiding them during work hours, he also often taught them to read drawings and operate in their spare time, enabling the apprentices to master a lot of technology.
    Because they have made achievements in improving quality and completing tasks, they were rated as an advanced team in the factory in the first quarter.

    受欢迎的检查员
    械工
    太原矿山机器厂装配检查组，是一个面向生产、联系群众的检查组。他们边检查、边生产，主动配合车间解决问题，受到了职工的好评和欢迎。全组八个人都受到过工人的表扬，称赞他们“既搞检查，又搞生产；既完成任务，又培养徒工”。工人们还称呼检查员吴长红和王守义是“红色检查员”。
    为什么他们能够获得这样的好评呢？
    “边检查、边生产”是他们在大跃进以来采取的新的工作方法。他们以检查为主，在搞好检查工作的基础上参加生产。有检查任务就检查，没有就生产。工人们很欢迎这样作法，说他们“以前是指手划脚，现在是和我们一起苦干巧干”。
    由于采取边检查边生产的方法，他们掌握和了解机器内部结构，从而便于进行检查工作，保证产品质量。如机器上漏装了零件，检查员主动装上；装错了就主动纠正过来；哪些地方不合格，就自己动手修理……。总之，只要他们能干就干，真正作到了既是检查者，又是生产者。
    他们进行检查工作的特点是，主动发现问题及时解决，防止产生废品。找问题有两种形式：一是通过资料消化，寻找图纸上的问题；一是通过生产，寻找实际中的问题。生产前，他们要消化图纸，尤其对新产品的图纸更是反复消化。这样，既掌握了机器的性能和机构，又可以找出图纸中的差错，对预防废品起了很大作用。检查员王守义和吴长红，通过资料消化发现移送机减速机图纸设计错误，反映给设计科后，立即进行了修改。在生产中他们将图纸和实物对照着找问题，发现机构不灵和配合不当等情况的时候，就设法加以解决。
    他们不仅主动地找问题，更重要的是能及时解决。如检查员周子珍发现装岩机机箱铸造时，因芯子对口皮缝太大，造成气路不通，就立即告诉铸造车间，防止了大批废品的产生。
    当生产上遇到技术关键，尤其是新产品技术关键的时候，他们就主动协助车间，想尽一切办法，改进工具，改进操作，和工人一道，苦干巧干，直到攻下关键为止。检查员何长兴，发现润滑设备密封圈用小刀下料质量太差、效率很低，成为完成任务的障碍。他便刻苦钻研，终于用废锯条改成了无齿锯，提高效率八倍。当试制摩擦压力机油泵遇到困难时，他又和工人一起，日夜寻找毛病，亲自修、亲自装、亲自试，终于找到了毛病，使油泵早日试制成功。检查员吴祯，发现20型打眼机在试车时经常发生毛病，不是这不对，就是那有问题。他就根据这些毛病，找出了装配需要注意的地方，保证了试车成功。
    检查人员多数是高级工匠，加之事先进行过资料消化，对机器的结构和性能比较了解，这就使他们具备了技术指导的条件。他们经常向低级工匠和徒工进行示范和讲解机器什么地方精密，什么地方粗糙，什么地方是重点，什么地方是一般，以及各种零件、部件的作用……。检查员何长兴除经常指导一般徒工外，还专门培养了两个徒工，使他们学会了装配减速机等产品。检查员李贵元专门带了四个徒工，除在工作时间指导外，还在业余时间经常教徒工看图和操作，使徒工掌握了很多技术。
    由于他们在提高质量和完成任务方面作出了成绩，因而在第一季被评为厂的先进小组。
