Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch from the 9th: Jiangxi Province’s Wanzai County Daqiao People’s Commune, while using its main strength to grasp grain production, is also reasonably arranging and developing diversified operations. Now, not only is the commune's grain production doing well, completing the early rice transplanting task on time, in quantity, and with quality; but also the animal husbandry and other industries that need to be grasped in a timely manner have also been taken up.

At the beginning of the spring plowing season, Daqiao Commune, due to the busy agricultural production, also concentrated its efforts solely on grasping early rice, neglecting the development of diversified operations. The commune's Party committee conducted multiple studies on this situation, believing that concentrating main efforts on grasping grain was correct, but if diversified operations were not grasped well at the beginning of the year, opportunities would be missed and losses would be incurred. Therefore, the commune's Party committee first organized all commune and team cadres to calculate the three benefits of developing diversified operations: increasing commune members' income, increasing accumulation, and supporting national industry and the market. This enabled everyone to further realize the important significance of developing diversified economies. Based on a unified understanding, from the commune to the production brigades and teams, specialized cadres were designated to strengthen leadership over diversified operations, and the plans for diversified operations were immediately handed over to the masses to mobilize discussion.

During the discussion and arrangement, based on the principle of not affecting grain production and not excessively dispersing labor, each production team classified and ranked diversified operations, first seizing the main projects that must be grasped currently. In terms of spring-sown cash crops: it was determined to plant 2,200 mu of ramie, 800 mu of jute, 40 mu of sugarcane, 67 mu of lilies, and use barren mountain slopes to plant 72 mu of medicinal herbs. In terms of economic forests: the main focus was on lacquer trees; originally, only one brigade had more than 100 trees, but now each team has newly planted 4,000 trees along fields and roadsides. In terms of animal husbandry: it was determined that this year's pig production should be doubled, averaging three pigs per household, chicken production should be quadrupled, averaging twenty chickens per household, and the production of sheep, rabbits, and other animals should be vigorously developed. In terms of fisheries: it was determined to make extensive use of reservoirs, ponds, and rice paddies in the spring to release fish fry, requiring an annual output of 1,500 dan of fresh fish.

In order to grasp these projects well, fully mobilize and utilize the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels and all commune members, the commune also, proceeding from the benefit of production, divided the scope of operations for different projects. It was determined that, except for cash crops, which, like grain production, would be contracted to the brigades for work, output, and costs, livestock, poultry, and fisheries would all be managed by the commune, brigade, team (or canteen), and commune members, with "four parties" raising them separately. After discussion by the masses, the distribution ratios and methods for the products were stipulated.

(Editor's note: Under the current circumstances, the vast majority of pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, etc., for example, 80% to 90%, should be raised by the team collective and commune members privately; in order to facilitate private raising by commune members, appropriate fodder land can be allocated to commune members to plant feed crops.)

After careful arrangements, the entire commune, from top to bottom, immediately took action. The small specialized shock teams for cash crops in each brigade completed the sowing tasks of ramie, jute, sugarcane, lilies, and medicinal herbs on time, with quality, in less than half a month. Animal husbandry and poultry farming have also developed rapidly due to the implementation of "four-party" separate raising and effective assistance to commune members in solving feed problems. Especially in the case of pigs, on the one hand, a specialized pig farm established by the commune increased the raising of more than 100 sows, breeding piglets to supply the production teams and commune members, and on the other hand, commune members successively purchased many piglets from other places. In less than three months, the number of pigs raised in the entire commune has increased by more than 1,000 heads compared to the beginning of the year. The development of fisheries has also been carried out in a timely manner, with 2 million silver carp and grass carp fry released into the eighteen reservoirs and one hundred and twenty fish ponds in each production team of the commune. More than 10,000 mu of early rice water-retaining fields also released carp fry before and after transplanting, averaging nearly 1,000 fry per mu.

Daqiao Commune, during the busy spring plowing season, not only seized the main projects of diversified operations that must be developed, but also made specific plans for diversified operations projects that are currently unable to be grasped and should be grasped in the future, such as papermaking, weaving summer cloth, logging, and some temporary small-scale sideline occupations, in accordance with the principle of "no work during agricultural busy season, small work during less busy season, big work during slack season." This ensures that cadres and commune members know what to grasp when the time comes, to ensure the completion of tasks.

    抓紧时机　具体规划　合理安排
    大抓粮食增产　大养猪羊鸡鱼
    大桥公社充分发挥群众积极性开展多种经营
    本报南昌9日电　江西省万载县大桥人民公社在以主要力量抓粮食生产的同时，合理安排和发展多种经营。现在，这个社不仅粮食生产搞得很好，按时、按量、按质地完成了早稻插秧任务；而且需要及时抓的畜牧等业，也都抓了起来。
    大桥公社在春耕开始的时候，也曾由于农业生产繁忙，只集中力量抓早稻，忽视了多种经营的发展。公社党委针对这个情况进行了多次研究，认为集中主要力量抓粮食是对的，但是，多种经营在一年开始时如果抓不好，就会错过时机，造成损失。因此，公社党委会首先组织全体社、队干部算了发展多种经营的三笔账：增加社员收入；增加积累；支援国家工业和市场。使大家进一步认识到了发展多种经济的重要意义。在统一认识的基础上，从公社到各生产大队、小队都指定专门干部加强了对多种经营的领导，并立即把多种经营的计划交给群众，发动群众讨论。
    在讨论和安排中，根据不影响粮食生产、不过分分散劳动力的原则，各生产队对多种经营进行了分类排队，首先抓住当前必须抓的主要项目。春播经济作物方面：确定种苎麻二千二百亩，黄麻八百亩，甘蔗四十亩，百合六十七亩，利用荒山土坡种植药材七十二亩。在经济林方面：主要抓漆树，原来只一个大队有一百多株，现在各队在田边、路旁又新植四千株。在畜牧业方面：确定今年生猪要增加两倍，平均每户达到三头，鸡增加四倍，平均每户达到二十只，并大力发展养羊、养兔等生产。渔业方面：确定春季大量利用水库、池塘和稻田放养鱼苗，要求年产鲜鱼一千五百担。
    为了抓好这些项目，充分调动和发挥各级组织和全体社员的积极性，公社还从有利生产出发，分别不同项目划分了经营范围，确定除经济作物同粮食生产一律由各大队实行包工包产包成本以外，家畜、家禽和渔业都实行公社、大队、小队（或食堂）、社员“四家”分养的办法，并经过群众讨论，规定了产品的分配比例和办法。
    （编者按：在目前情况下，猪鸡鸭鹅等的绝大部分，例如80％到90％，应由小队集体饲养和社员私人饲养；为了便于社员私人饲养，可以拨出适当的饲料地交给社员种植饲料作物。）
    通过细致地安排以后，全公社从上到下都立即行动起来了。各大队的经济作物小型专业突击队，以不到半个月的时间，即分别按时按质地完成了苎麻、黄麻、甘蔗、百合和药材的播种任务。家畜家禽由于实行“四家”分养，并切实帮助社员解决了饲料问题，也获得了迅速发展。特别是生猪，一方面，公社建立的一个专门种猪场增养了一百多头母猪，繁殖小猪供应各生产队和社员，一方面社员又从外地陆续购进了许多小猪，至今不到三个月的时间，全社饲养的生猪即比年初增加了一千多头。渔业的发展也作到了不误季节，全社各生产队的十八个水库和一百二十口可以养鱼的水塘，共放养了二百多万尾鲢鱼和草鱼，一万多亩早稻保水田在插秧前后也放养了鲤鱼苗，平均每亩近千尾。
    大桥公社在春耕大忙季节不仅抓住了必须发展的多种经营的主要项目，并且对于当前无力抓和今后应该抓的多种经营项目，如造纸、织夏布、采伐林木，以及一些临时性的小型副业，也分别按照“农业大忙不搞、小忙小搞、不忙大搞”的原则，进行了具体规划，使干部和社员心中有数，到时候该抓什么就抓什么，以确保任务的完成。
