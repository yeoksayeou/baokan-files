Promote More Cotton Bolls Before the Dog Days
Ding Changming

Cotton is a thermophilic and photophilic crop with indeterminate inflorescence. As long as the temperature is suitable and management is strengthened in a timely and reasonable manner, it can continue to flower and produce bolls. However, in the cotton-producing areas of North China, the frost-free period is only about 180 to 200 days, and the sowing, growth, and boll formation of cotton are greatly affected by the frost period. An important method to increase the yield of cotton per unit area is to strive for more plants and bolls per unit area. On the basis of reasonable close planting, striving for early and more bolls per cotton plant within the limited growth time of cotton is the most important link to ensure increased cotton production.

According to the experience of large-scale high-yield cotton production last year, strengthening seedling management early can promote early boll setting and more bolls before the "dog days". (Note: The beginning of the dog days this year is July 17th.)

The growth of cotton consists of two aspects: vegetative growth and reproductive growth. Promoting early boll setting and more bolls before the dog days not only directly increases the number of bolls on a single cotton plant, but also promotes the balanced development of reproductive and vegetative growth of cotton, so that the organic nutrients in the cotton plant are more evenly distributed. Even in the case of abundant water and fertilizer later, the growth of the cotton plant can be stable and not rapid, further ensuring the bolls that grow during the dog days and increasing the bolls that grow in the autumn, so that the plant is full of bolls from top to bottom, achieving a bumper harvest. If the bolls do not set before the dog days, the organic nutrients in the cotton plant will mainly be used for growing branches and leaves, and vegetative growth will be greater than reproductive growth, which will cause the growth and development to lose balance. The buds and bolls that are formed later will not receive the normal supply of nutrients, which will increase the difficulty of ensuring bolls that grow during the dog days and increasing the bolls that grow in the autumn. According to multiple experiments by the Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the boll shedding rate on the first to fifth fruit branches of the same cotton plant is about 40% lower than that on the eleventh to fifteenth fruit branches; on the same fruit branch, the boll shedding rate on the first fruit node is also about 30% lower than that on the fifth fruit node. Therefore, if the cotton bolls close to the lower part and close to the main stem cannot be preserved, it will be more difficult to preserve the subsequent cotton bolls. Furthermore, according to the facts of large-scale high-yield cotton production in Shandong Province last year, ensuring that each cotton plant has two or three mature bolls before the dog days can enable each mu of cotton land to obtain 124 to 180 jin or more of high-quality ginned cotton. At the same time, as long as each cotton plant can retain two or three mature bolls, it will be easier to retain five or six bolls that grow during the dog days and three or four bolls that grow in the autumn, thereby obtaining a high yield of 370 to 500 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Promoting more bolls before the dog days is of particular importance for achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest of cotton.

How to promote more bolls before the dog days? According to the experience of large-scale high-yield cotton production in Shandong Province last year, measures such as increasing soil temperature and strengthening early seedling management are taken. The central link to promote cotton growth and budding lies in increasing soil temperature. Years of scientific experiments have proven that cotton needs more than 200 degrees of effective cumulative temperature from emergence to budding. The cotton farmers in Shandong Province have had the habit of "hoeing for dreams" (shallow hoeing before cotton seeds germinate) for many years. They say: "Early cultivation warms the ground, frequent cultivation prevents the ground from hardening, and deep cultivation prevents both waterlogging and drought." These measures are to increase temperature and loosen the soil. Because after cultivation, especially deep cultivation, air can flow into the deep layers of the soil, increasing the soil temperature. According to experiments in various parts of Shandong, cultivation can generally increase the soil temperature by two to four degrees. When cultivating, earthing up between the rows increases the area of the land that absorbs sunlight, which can more quickly promote the development and growth of cotton seedlings, and earlier and more cotton bolls can form.

In the case of reasonable close planting and increased sowing volume of cotton, the cotton will inevitably be dense and crowded after breaking the soil. Timely thinning and setting seedlings will also promote the sturdy and healthy growth of cotton plants and avoid weak and slender internodes. According to experimental observations, cotton plants that have been crowded for a long time in the early stage of cotton growth and development will have their first fruit branches grow three to five days later than normally grown plants, creating unfavorable conditions for early boll setting. According to a survey in Linqing City, in the same cotton field, cotton plants that were thinned at the four true leaf stage produced 19% less cotton than those thinned at the two true leaf stage, and those thinned at the six true leaf stage produced 33% less cotton. In order to promote the healthy growth of cotton seedlings and the early and prolific formation of bolls before the dog days, the fertilization and watering of cotton should also be tailored to the field conditions and the seedlings, and various diseases and insect pests should be eliminated as early as possible. Within 10 to 20 days after cotton germination, the effective phosphorus contained in the seeds is generally exhausted, and it is extremely necessary to increase phosphate and potash fertilizers. At the same time, early fertilization and increased application of phosphate fertilizer can also stimulate the absorption of potash fertilizer by cotton seedlings, improve the utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer, and promote the healthy growth of cotton seedlings and early budding and boll formation. On the basis of winter irrigation and good moisture conservation in cotton fields, appropriately delaying watering during the seedling stage is conducive to the roots extending downwards and can also increase the buds and bolls in the lower part of the cotton plant.

At present, cotton sowing has basically ended in various places. On the basis of successfully passing the cotton sowing stage, immediately launching a high tide of seedling management to promote early boll formation, prolific boll formation, and the formation of large bolls is an important key to ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest of cotton. The opportunity must not be missed, and time waits for no one. Everyone must seize the opportunity.

    促使棉花伏前多结桃
    丁长明
    棉花是一种喜温好光的无限花序作物，只要温度适宜，及时合理地加强管理，就可以连续开花结铃。但在我国华北各产棉地区，无霜期仅有一百八十天至二百天左右，棉花的播种、生长和结桃，受霜期影响很大。提高棉花单位面积产量的一个重要方法是争取单位面积上多长株数和桃数。在合理密植的基础上，在棉花生长有限的时间内，争取单株棉桃早结多结棉桃又是保证棉花增产最重要的一环。
    根据去年许多棉花大面积高额丰产经验，提前加强幼苗管理，可以促使棉花早座桃，多座伏前桃。（按：今年初伏是7月17日。）
    棉花的生长是由营养生长和生殖生长两个方面组成。促使棉花早座桃，多座伏前桃不仅直接增加了棉花单株上的桃数，还能促使棉花生殖生长和营养生长均衡的发展，使棉株内的有机养料比较均衡地分配，即便在以后水大肥足的情况下，棉株的生长也能稳而不猛，进一步保住伏桃，增结秋桃，使上下满桃，达到丰收的目的。如果伏前座不住桃，棉株内的有机养分就主要用于生长枝叶，营养生长盛于生殖生长，使生长与发育失去均衡，以后结的蕾铃也得不到所需养料的正常供应，这对保住伏桃，增结秋桃增加了困难。根据山东省农业科学院的多次试验，在同一株棉花上第一到第五个果枝上的棉桃，要比十一到十五个果枝上的棉桃，减少脱落40％左右；在同一个果枝上，第一个果节上的棉桃，也要比第五个果节上的棉桃减少脱落30％左右。所以靠近下部和靠近主干的棉桃保不住，以后的棉桃要保住也就比较困难。另据山东省去年许多棉花大面积高额丰产的事实证明，保证在入伏前每株棉花座住两、三个老桃，每亩棉花首先就能获得一百二十四斤至一百八十多斤优级籽棉。同时只要每株棉花能保住两、三个老桃，也就容易保住五、六个伏桃和三、四个秋桃，因此获得亩产三百七十斤至五百斤籽棉的高额产量。促使棉花多座伏前桃，对实现棉花全面丰收有特别重要的意义。
    如何促使棉花伏前多座桃呢？山东省根据去年许多棉花大面积高额丰产的经验，是提高地温，及早加强幼苗管理等措施。促使棉花生长、现蕾的中心环节在于提高地温。多年的科学试验证明，棉花自出苗到现蕾，需要有二百多度的有效总积温。山东省的棉农多年来就有“锄梦花”（棉种抽芽前进行浅锄）的习惯。他们说：“早中耕地发暖，勤中耕地不板，深中耕防涝又防旱。”这些措施就是为了增温和松土。因为中耕后，特别是深耕可使空气流入土壤深层，增加土壤的温度。据山东各地试验，中耕后一般的可增加地温二至四度，中耕时随着在行间进行培土，增加土地吸收阳光的面积，就能更快地促使棉苗发育生长，早结和多结棉桃。
    在棉花合理密植增加播种量的情况下，棉花破土后必然稠密拥挤，及早进行间苗、定苗，也会促使棉株生长蹲实、健壮，避免间节瘦弱细长。据试验观察，在棉花生长发育初期，受过较长时间拥挤的棉株，生长第一个果枝的时间比正常生长的要推迟三天至五天，为早座棉桃造成不利条件。另据临清市的调查，在同样的棉田里，棉花长出四个真叶时间苗，比在两个真叶时间苗少产19％，在六个真叶时间苗更少产33％。为促使棉苗健壮生长，早结和多结伏前桃，对棉花的施肥和浇水也要作到田地因苗制宜，并及早消灭各种病虫害。棉花出芽后十至二十天内，种籽内含的有效磷素，一般都已消耗殆尽，极需增加磷钾肥。同时早施肥和增施磷肥，还可刺激棉苗对钾肥的吸收，提高氮肥的利用率，促使棉苗生长健壮，早结蕾铃。在棉田冬灌及作好保墒的基础上，适当推迟苗期浇水，有利于根系向下伸长，也可增加棉株下部的蕾铃。
    目前，各地棉花播种已基本结束，在胜利度过棉花播种关的基础上，立即开展一个促使棉花早结桃、多结桃和结大桃的幼苗管理高潮，是保证棉花全面丰收的重要关键。机不可失，时不再来，大家必须抓紧时机。
