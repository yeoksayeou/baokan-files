Jinan, May 11 (reporter of this newspaper). On the Jinan Iron and Steel front, the mass technical innovation movement of "breaking through four barriers (output, quality, cost, and coke ratio) and fiercely attacking high sulfur" has achieved brilliant results after more than 40 days of fighting. The average qualified rate of pig iron in the city reached 84.7%; the utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces averaged about one ton; the coke consumption per ton of pig iron was reduced to 967 kg to 1,136 kg for blast furnaces with a volume of 55 to 84 cubic meters, and to 1,266 kg to 1,375 kg for blast furnaces with a volume of 3 to 13 cubic meters; the cost of pig iron was also reduced from 398 yuan per ton in January to 172 yuan.

It was not easy for the Jinan Iron and Steel front to achieve this result. Their production conditions are not considered good. The iron ore content averages only about 40%, the coke is all made by indigenous methods, and 44.3% of the blast furnaces have a small volume of 3 to 13 cubic meters. The reason they achieved such results is mainly because the Municipal Party Committee strengthened its leadership over production and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses.

In mid-February, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally convened a forum with the Party Committee Secretaries, furnace chiefs, and technicians of various steel plants, and checked the production situation plant by plant and furnace by furnace. During the inspection process, "pace-setters" with high output, good quality, and low cost were found in various furnace types. For example, the 13-cubic-meter small blast furnace of the Iron Smelting Plant of the Provincial People's Committee organs produced an average of 17 tons of pig iron per day, and the cost per ton of pig iron was less than 190 yuan. Then, pace-setters were established, and the battle of "breaking through four barriers and fiercely attacking high sulfur" was launched.

In order to make the mass movement deep and thorough, each plant (workshop) established a technical innovation committee or "breaking four barriers" headquarters headed by the Party Committee Secretary. Many units' Party Committee Secretaries participated in labor with the workers, acting as both commanders and combatants. During the movement, the Municipal Party Committee and District Party Committee paid attention to giving play to the role of "pace-setters," holding on-site meetings and organizing visits and learning, summarizing and promoting their experience in a timely manner, breaking superstitions, and finding solutions, so that the mass movement developed vigorously, wave after wave.

Breaking through the three barriers of raw material processing, smelting, and external desulfurization is the main goal of "breaking through four barriers." Raw material processing adopts the method of "elaborate processing of coarse grains," removing impurities and controlling particle size. If the moisture content is high, it must be preheated to ensure that the small blast furnace eats "dry, clean, uniform, and cooked" materials. The blowers of the small blast furnaces adopt a parallel method to increase the air volume by about one time; the tubular hot blast furnace adopts a multi-burner method to increase the temperature to more than 700 degrees; quicklime is used instead of limestone in the furnace to increase the desulfurization capacity. For molten iron with a high sulfur content, quicklime and salt are added outside the furnace to reduce the sulfur content of the iron. In short, the three barriers are all about desulfurization.

In order to ensure quality, technical management was also strengthened. It is strictly stipulated that pig iron that does not meet the requirements will not be counted as a task and will not be allowed to be transferred externally. At the same time, the testing and inspection system was strengthened, stipulating that raw materials and pig iron should be tested in batches and furnaces; a factory label and iron classification management system was established.

First, according to the supply of coal and ore, the battle line was shortened to achieve fewer furnaces and more iron. The specific approach is to give full play to the role of blast furnaces with a volume of 13 cubic meters or more, and all those with complete equipment will be put into production; most of the 3-cubic-meter small blast furnaces will be moved to the mining area for production, with only a few good ones retained; and the 1.5-cubic-meter and smaller small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces in the urban area will be eliminated.

Second, labor organization was rectified, and personnel were streamlined. The establishment was determined separately for various furnace types. The number of iron smelting workers in the four districts of the city was reduced from the original 15,000 to 9,000.

Third, an economic accounting system was implemented. Systems for raw material management, financial management, and cost accounting were established and improved. The prices of ore and coke were reasonably adjusted, and prices were determined based on quality and quantity, which promoted the economic accounting work of iron smelting plants, as well as mines, coal mines, and coking units.

### 济南市加强对小高炉技术管理  关关脱硫确保质量

    济南市加强对小高炉技术管理
    关关脱硫确保质量
    本报讯　济南市钢铁战线上“大破四关（产量、质量、成本、焦比），猛攻高硫”的群众性技术革新运动，经过四十多天的战斗，已经获得了辉煌的成果。全市平均生铁合格率达到84.7％；小高炉的利用系数平均达到一吨左右；每吨生铁的焦炭消耗量，五十五到八十四立方公尺的高炉降低到九百六十七公斤至一千一百三十六公斤，三到十三立方公尺的高炉降低到一千二百六十六公斤至一千三百七十五公斤；生铁成本也由1月份的每吨三百九十八元，降低到一百七十二元。
    济南市钢铁战线上获得这个成绩是不容易的。他们的生产条件并不算好，铁矿石含铁量平均只有40％左右，焦炭全部是用土法炼制的，高炉中有44.3％的容积是三至十三立方公尺的小高炉。他们所以取得这样的成绩，主要是市委加强了对生产的领导，充分发动了群众积极性的结果。
    2月中旬，市委第一书记亲自召开了各钢铁厂党委书记、高炉炉长和技术员的座谈会，逐厂、逐炉地检查了生产情况。在检查过程中，找到了各种炉型中产量高、质量好、成本低的“标兵”。如省人民委员会机关炼铁厂十三立方公尺的小高炉，平均日产生铁十七吨，每吨生铁成本在一百九十元以下。接着，竖立标兵，开展了“大破四关，猛攻高硫”的战斗。
    为了把群众运动搞深、搞透，各厂（车间）都以党委书记为首成立了技术革新委员会或“破四关”指挥部，很多单位的党委书记和工人一起参加劳动，作到了既是指挥员又是战斗员。运动中，市委、区委都注意了发挥“标兵”的作用，召开现场会和组织参观、学习，及时总结和推广他们的经验，破除迷信，找出办法，使群众运动有声有色，一浪高于一浪地向前发展。
    突破原料加工、冶炼、炉外脱硫三关，是“大破四关”的主攻目标。原料加工采取“粗粮细作”的方法，去掉杂质，控制粒度，如果含水分大时，还要经过预热，以保证小高炉吃得“干、净、匀、熟”。小高炉的风机采取并联的方法，把风量提高一倍左右；管式热风炉采用多嘴燃烧的方法，将温度提高到七百多度；炉内用生石灰代替石灰石，加大了脱硫能力。对含硫较高的铁水，在炉外再加生石灰和食盐，以减低铁的含硫量。总之，三道关口，关关脱硫。
    为了保证质量，还加强了技术管理工作。严格规定：不合要求的生铁，不算任务，不准外调。同时，加强化验和检查制度，规定原料和生铁要分批、分炉化验；建立工厂标签和铁的分类管理制度。
    首先，根据煤炭、矿石供应情况，缩短战线，作到少开炉，多出铁。具体做法是：充分发挥十三立方公尺以上高炉的作用，凡设备完整的，全部开炉生产；三立方公尺的小高炉，大部分迁到矿区生产，只保留部分好的；淘汰市区的一点五立方公尺以下的小高炉和土高炉。
    其次，整顿劳动组织，精简人员。对各种不同炉型，分别确定了编制。市内四个区的炼铁职工，由原来的一万五千人减少到九千人。
    第三、实行经济核算制度。建立和健全原材料管理、财务管理和成本核算等制度。矿石、焦炭都合理调整了价格，按质、按量论价，既促进了各炼铁厂，也促进了矿山、煤矿、炼焦等单位的经济核算工作。（附图片）
    去年“七一”才动工兴建的济南钢铁厂，现在已初具规模，炼铁、炼钢及轧钢等重要工程都进入紧张施工阶段。郑　华摄（新华社稿）
