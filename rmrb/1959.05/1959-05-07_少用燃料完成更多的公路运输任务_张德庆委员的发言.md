Comrades Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members:

　　I fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report and wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's report. I will strive to resolutely implement them in my work and actions.

　　Regarding transportation, Premier Zhou clearly outlined the work that should be diligently carried out to achieve the 1959 plan, including effectively leveraging the potential of existing transportation equipment, conserving fuel consumption, completing more transportation tasks with existing equipment, and vigorously organizing vehicles and ships in rural people's communes to supplement the shortcomings of modern transportation equipment. Premier Zhou also mentioned reducing and eliminating excessively long-distance transportation. Vice Premier Li Fuchun also provided clear instructions on highway transportation in his report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, including the need to vigorously conserve fuel usage and adopt alternative fuels.

　　From these instructions, I realize that the 1959 national economic plan is a plan for continued great leaps forward. The transportation tasks are heavy, and transportation equipment is not abundant. To complete the transportation plan, we should fully leverage the potential of various transportation equipment. Transportation equipment that cannot be fully utilized due to insufficient liquid fuel should first adopt alternative fuels and be put into transportation. Regions too far from oil production areas should make the most of local fuels, freeing up long-distance transportation tools that use petroleum to support the timely transfer of important means of production and necessities of life. Measures should be taken to conserve fuel consumption, enabling existing transportation tools to complete more transportation tasks.

　　Three Ways to Save Fuel:
    Use diesel engines instead of gasoline engines; improve the Jiefang brand automobile engine; widely utilize various gaseous fuels

　　In order to implement the instructions of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li on highway transportation, the following three relatively effective measures are worth taking in terms of fuel conservation. First, where conditions permit, diesel engines should be used on trucks instead of gasoline engines. Although the thermal efficiency of gasoline engines is constantly improving, and the price difference between gasoline and diesel is gradually narrowing, the thermal efficiency of diesel engines is generally higher than that of gasoline engines, and the price of diesel is generally lower than that of gasoline. Therefore, using diesel vehicles instead of gasoline vehicles for transportation will always save fuel. In a situation where petroleum production cannot keep up with the great leap forward in the production of major industrial and agricultural products such as steel and grain, and the country needs to import some petroleum to supplement the shortfall, using some diesel vehicles instead of gasoline vehicles will definitely save foreign exchange. However, diesel vehicles also have shortcomings, such as the higher technical skills required for the repair and maintenance of the engine's fuel supply system, and the difficulty of starting diesel vehicles in cold regions. Therefore, diesel vehicles are more advantageous when used in larger transportation units.

　　Using diesel engines with spherical combustion chambers (located at the top of the piston) that do not require high fuel quality in diesel vehicles can expand the types of usable fuel, thereby saving on the relatively small output of light diesel.

　　Improving the engine of the Jiefang brand automobile can save a lot of gasoline. It is recommended that the First Automobile Factory and the Automobile Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, based on the experience already gained in our country's research on improving the Jiefang brand automobile engine, fully utilize the successful experience of the Soviet Union in improving the ZIS-120 engine and the achievements obtained in the research and improvement of the Jiefang brand automobile engine in the German Democratic Republic, and promptly study and improve the engine of the Jiefang brand automobile to reduce its gasoline consumption. In addition, the use of two-stage combustion engines in gasoline vehicles can save gasoline. This type of engine is designed based on the chain reaction principle during combustion. A small portion of the combustion chamber is separated near the spark plug for ignition, drawing in a relatively rich, easily ignitable fresh mixture from the carburetor, while the fresh mixture in the main combustion chamber is relatively lean and not easily combustible, but has higher economy. The two combustion chambers are connected. The richer fresh mixture in the ignition combustion chamber is ignited by the spark plug, and after combustion becomes active, the chain reaction effect causes the normal combustion of the originally difficult-to-ignite, lean fresh mixture in the main combustion chamber. Vehicles using this type of engine can save more than 20% of gasoline under favorable conditions, and more than 7% under average use conditions.

　　In terms of alternative fuels, various combustible gases with not-too-low calorific value can be compressed and bottled for use as a substitute for liquid fuels in automobiles, ferries, etc.

　　Natural gas in Sichuan has been used for many years in areas such as Chongqing, either by filling it into oilcloth bags or compressing it into bottles for use as a substitute for liquid fuels in automobiles and ferries. Natural gas can also be transported over longer distances through pipelines after being compressed to high pressure. Two hundred atmospheres is the common bottling pressure currently used in automobiles. After natural gas is liquefied at four hundred atmospheres, harmful impurities can be removed and the calorific value per unit volume (heat content) can be increased, making it an ideal fuel for trucks, especially refrigerated trucks. Relevant research institutions should cooperate in conducting research and use of liquefied methane.

　　Units that produce coke can compress coke oven gas into bottles for use as fuel for their own trucks. In accordance with the spirit of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li's instructions, these units should no longer use gasoline and diesel transported from remote areas in their trucks.

　　Large cities with illuminating gas can compress illuminating gas into bottles for use as fuel for buses. This can also reduce the harmful gases emitted by buses using liquid fuels in large cities.

　　Rural areas can use various excrement, fruit peels, vegetable roots, yellow leaves, and other residues and wastes from agricultural products, allowing them to ferment, thereby improving their effectiveness as fertilizers. The biogas produced as a byproduct can be compressed into bottles for use as fuel for rural simple vehicles, thereby expanding the fuel source for rural vehicles.

　　Propane, butane, propylene, and butylene compressed and liquefied from the petroleum industry are currently the most ideal alternative fuels for automobiles. The technology for their application in automobiles has been mastered by our technicians, making it easy to promote and apply. They should be fully utilized as soon as possible, primarily as fuel for buses, and should no longer be discarded as waste in some areas.

　　Wood, charcoal, and anthracite coal can be gasified in automobile gas generators and used as automobile fuel, which we already have experience in our country. However, these fuels are not produced everywhere in the country. The Automobile Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building has tested the gasification of bituminous coal in automobile gas generators, which has practical possibilities. After the widespread application of gas generator vehicles that burn bituminous coal, the source of alternative fuels for automobiles can be greatly expanded. Gas generator vehicles can burn suitable local fuels in various parts of the country, supplementing the shortfall of gasoline and diesel vehicles and undertaking transportation tasks.

　　In mountainous plateau areas, steam cars can more effectively leverage traction compared to automobiles using gasoline, diesel, or gas. Steam cars can use condensers, so their thermal efficiency is higher than that of steam locomotives on railways. The design can retain the characteristics of automobiles, so the self-weight is not very large. They can burn several types of local fuels that are not suitable for gas vehicles, making it easier to burn local fuels and undertake transportation tasks in plateau areas. Therefore, the possibility and economy of using steam cars on plateau highways in our country should also be seriously studied, striving to use local fuels and reduce the transportation costs of supplying important necessities of life to plateau areas. This is a politically significant task.

　　Is using alternative fuels economical? What is the power output? What is the lifespan of the vehicle? Will it disrupt the production order or prolong the total assembly time?

　　Is using alternative fuels economical? Diesel is the cheapest liquid fuel for automobiles, but after World War II, many capitalist countries used bottled gas instead of diesel as fuel for buses, including the United States. This shows that bottled gas is a more economical fuel than gasoline and diesel. The price of solid fuel used in gas generators is much lower than that of liquid fuels in terms of heat content. Although gas generator vehicles have higher repair and maintenance costs, the total transportation costs, including fuel, maintenance, repairs, and management, are roughly the same as those of gasoline vehicles. The price of coal in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is higher than in North China, but the transportation costs of gas generator vehicles in these two provinces were slightly lower than those of gasoline vehicles in the past, and slightly higher recently. This is because the anthracite coal used for automobiles is not treated as industrial coal, and the price is higher, and the quality cannot be guaranteed as it is for industrial coal. When we consider that using coal for trucks can save oil, and therefore treat automobile coal (including anthracite, semi-coke, and lignite) as industrial coal, we can reduce the transportation costs of gas vehicles and improve the power and economy of gas vehicles.

　　Will the power of trucks decrease after using alternative fuels? The power of automobiles can be increased after converting to liquefied gases such as propane and butane. The power will decrease after converting to generator gas, but automobiles rarely run at maximum power, so the transportation capacity of the automobile decreases less than the maximum power. Moreover, replacing it with a gas engine specially designed for generator gas can maintain the original power of the automobile. The octane numbers of combustible gases such as methane, propane, coke oven gas, and generator gas are different, but they are all higher than the octane number of gasoline used for trucks. These gases are also not easy to condense in the engine when the engine starts. Therefore, when converting to these gases, the cylinder head should be changed according to their performance in order to allow the engine to fully output power.

　　What is the lifespan of an automobile after using alternative fuels? Using natural gas, coke oven gas, illuminating gas, as well as propane, butane, propylene, and butylene can reduce cylinder wear and prolong the lifespan of the automobile. Using generator gas, if the filtration is not good, will reduce the lifespan of the automobile, but with appropriate filters, the lifespan of gas generator vehicles can be no lower than that of gasoline and diesel vehicles.

　　In order to quickly promote the use of alternative fuels, the modification of the engine can start with increasing the compression ratio, and then manufacturing cylinder heads suitable for gas engines, including the parts on the cylinder head. Only in the final stage will specially designed gas engines be produced. In each stage, attention should be paid to the maximum degree of interchangeability with gasoline engine parts.

　　Will producing gas vehicles in existing factories disrupt the production order or prolong the total assembly time? No. Even for gas generator vehicles, which have the greatest difference from gasoline vehicles, the assembly of the gas generator on the assembly line can be simplified to tightening three bolts. This task can also be performed simultaneously with other tasks. At the end of the assembly line, the car can be driven away simply by hanging a normally gasified gas generator on a trailer. Hanging the trailer and connecting the gas hose takes less than two minutes. Therefore, the total assembly time of a gas vehicle will not be longer than that of a gasoline vehicle. The trailer with the generator can also travel with the driver between the assembly line and the train station. The generator on the gas vehicle itself can be kept unlit. Therefore, there is no need to light the furnace on the assembly line, and there is no need to extinguish the furnace before loading the freight car at the train station. Therefore, assembling gas vehicles on the assembly line can be free of smoke and gasoline odor, and the air is better than when assembling gasoline vehicles.

　　The current problem is that the understanding of using alternative fuels is not consistent, and research needs to be strengthened

　　The current problems are: First of all, there is no consistent understanding of the need to vigorously save fuel and use alternative fuels in highway transportation. Therefore, research on alternative fuels is difficult to schedule, and people who originally researched this aspect are often transferred to other jobs and cannot complete the task of researching alternative fuels. No unit in the field of applied chemistry participates in the research on alternative fuels. Users have concerns about the compression and use of gas and lack 200 and 300 atmosphere gas cylinders and gas compressors. In a certain place, the original gas company's compressors, which can still be used after overhaul, cannot be scheduled for repair, so the compressed gas vehicles prepared by the research institution, which can be tested as long as they are charged with gas, cannot fulfill the requirement of charging gas for a long time. These are unavoidable phenomena in the great leap forward, but once the need for alternative fuels is clarified, all problems will not be difficult to solve.

　　In order to implement the instructions of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li on highway transportation, first of all, the relevant parties are required to have a unified understanding and realize the importance of saving fuel and using alternative fuels, which is not backwardness, but walking on two legs. The research on the use of alternative fuels in highway transportation is best organized by the Science and Technology Commission, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the public utilities bureaus of cities with gas to cooperate. The results obtained should be quickly promoted and applied. Key issues should be included in the 1959 research plan for research. The First Ministry of Machine Building is requested to produce 200 atmosphere gas cylinders and a small number of 300 atmosphere gas cylinders installed on charging vehicles to supply gas compressors. Gas companies, bus companies, and transportation companies are requested to negotiate the laying of pipelines. This can pave the way for the use of alternative fuels in land transportation.

　　I think this conference is a rally for our determination to complete and overfulfill the 1959 plan. I must strengthen the struggle for the leadership of the Party, especially the leadership of the grass-roots Party committee of my unit, unite the masses, unite the youth, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, regularly work in the factory, adhere to self-transformation, and boost greater enthusiasm to devote my heart and effort in completing and overfulfilling the plan for continued great leap forward in 1959.

　　Please criticize and correct any incorrect points in the above speech.

专栏：

　　少用燃料完成更多的公路运输任务
    张德庆委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意李维汉副主席的报告、衷心拥护周总理的报告，并将在我的工作与行动中力求坚决贯彻。
    在运输方面，周总理明确地指示了为了实现一九五九年的计划应当努力进行的工作，其中包括有效地发挥现有各种运输设备的潜力，节约燃料的消耗，以现有的运输设备完成更多的运输任务，大力组织农村人民公社中的车辆和船只，以补充现代运输设备的不足。周总理还提到了减少以至消除过远运输。李富春副总理在关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告中对公路运输也作了明确的指示，其中包括应当大力节约油料的使用，采用代用燃料。
    从这些指示中我体会到一九五九年国民经济计划是一个继续大跃进的计划，运输任务很重，运输设备并不充裕，要完成运输计划，应当充分发挥各种运输设备的潜力；因为液体燃料不足而不能充分利用的运输设备首先应当采用代用燃料，投入运输。距离石油产地过远的地区应当尽量利用当地燃料，让出石油占用的远程运输工具，支援重要生产资料和生活资料的及时调运；应当采取措施，节约燃料消耗，使现有的运输工具完成更多的运输任务。
    节约燃料的三个办法：
    采用柴油机代替汽油机；改进解放牌汽车发动机；广泛利用各种气体燃料
    为了贯彻周总理和李副总理关于公路运输方面的指示，在节约燃料方面，下列三个比较有效的措施，值得采取。首先是在有条件的情况下，在载重汽车上采用柴油机代替汽油机。虽是汽油机的热效率在不断提高、汽油和柴油的价格差别在逐渐缩小，但是柴油机的热效率总还比汽油机的热效率高，柴油的价格总还比汽油的低。所以用柴油车代替汽油车运输，总  以节省燃料。在石油生产暂时还跟不上钢铁、粮食等主要工农业产品的生产大跃进，国家需要进口一部分石油以资补充的情况下，用一部分柴油车代替汽油车肯定可以节省外汇。但是柴油车也有缺点，如发动机的燃料供给系统的修理、保养需要较高的技术，在寒冷地区早晨发动柴油车比较困难。所以柴油车用在规模较大的运输单位，比较有利。
    在柴油车上采用对燃料要求不高的具有球形燃烧室（位于活塞顶部）的柴油发动机可以扩大可用燃料的种类，因而节约产量比较少的轻柴油。
    改进解放牌汽车的发动机可以节约很多汽油。建议第一汽车厂和一机部汽车研究所，在我国研究改进解放牌汽车发动机工作中已经得到的经验的基础上，充分利用苏联改进吉斯一二○发动机的成功经验及德意志民主共和国研究、改进解放牌汽车发动机工作中所获得的成就，从速研究改进解放牌汽车的发动机，降低它的汽油消耗。此外在汽油车上采用两级燃烧发动机可以节约汽油。这种发动机是根据燃烧进行中的连锁反应原理设计的。燃烧室在火花塞的附近隔出一小部分，以便点火，由化油器吸入比较浓的、易于着火燃烧的新鲜混合气，主燃烧室内的新鲜混合气比较稀薄，不易燃烧，但经济性比较高。两个燃烧室相通。点火燃烧室内的较浓的新鲜混合气经火花塞点火，燃烧活跃后，由于连锁反应作用，引起原来不易着火的、主燃烧室内稀薄新鲜混合气的正常燃烧。采用这种发动机的汽车，在有利条件下可以节约汽油百分之二十以上，在平均使用条件下也可以节约汽油百分之七以上。
    在燃料代用方面，各种含热量不太低的可燃气体，可以压缩装瓶后在汽车、渡轮等上代替液体燃料。
    四川的天然煤气，多年以来，在重庆等地区，或装入油布袋内、或压缩装瓶后用在汽车和渡轮上代替液体燃料。天然煤气用高压压缩后还可以用管道输送到较远的地区去应用。二百大气压是目前在汽车上通用的装瓶压力。天然煤气在四百大气压下液化后，可以除去有害杂质、提高单位容积的热值（所含热量），是载重车，特别是冷藏车的很理想的燃料。有关的研究机构应当协作进行液化甲烷的研究、使用。
    生产焦炭的单位可以焦炉煤气压缩装瓶，作为本单位的载重汽车的燃料。根据周总理和李副总理指示的精神，这些单位不应当再在载重车上用从遥远地区运来的汽油和柴油。
    有照明煤气的大城市可以照明煤气压缩装瓶，用作公共汽车的燃料。这样，还可以减少大城市中用液体燃料的公共汽车排泄出来的、有害健康的气体。
    农村可以用各种粪便、果皮、菜根、黄叶等农产品的残余、废物，使它们发酵，从而提高它们作为肥料的功效，作为副产品的沼气可以压缩装瓶后用作农村简易汽车的燃料，从而扩大农村汽车的燃料来源。
    石油工业中的丙烷、丁烷、丙烯、丁烯压缩液化后是目前最理想的汽车代用燃料；它们在汽车上应用的技术已由我国技术员掌握，因而易于推广应用，应当从速充分利用，首先是用作公共汽车的燃料，不应再有若干部分作为废物放掉。
    木柴、木炭、无烟煤在汽车煤气发生炉中气化后用作汽车燃料，在我国已有经验。但是这些燃料也不是全国各地都产。一机部汽车研究所已经试验了在汽车用煤气发生炉内气化烟煤，有实用的可能。燃用烟煤的煤气发生炉汽车得到推广应用之后，可以大大扩大汽车代用燃料的来源。煤气发生炉汽车可以在全国各地燃用当地的适用燃料，补充汽油车、柴油车的不足，担承运输任务。
    在多山的高原地区蒸汽汽车比较用汽油、柴油或煤气的汽车可以更有利地发挥牵引力。蒸汽汽车可以用凝结器，所以热效率比铁路上的蒸汽机车高；设计上可以保留汽车的特点，所以自重不很大；可以燃烧不适用于煤气车的若干种当地燃料，所以更易于在高原地区燃用当地燃料，担承运输。因此还应当认真研究在我国高原公路上采用蒸汽汽车的可能性与经济性，力求利用当地燃料，降低供应高原地区重要生活资料的运输费。这是一个有政治意义的任务。
    采用代用燃料是否经济？功率如何？汽车寿命如何？会不会打乱生产秩序或延长总装配时间？
    采用代用燃料是否经济？柴油是最廉的汽车用液体燃料，但是第二次世界大战以后许多资本主义国家采用瓶装煤气代替柴油，作为公共汽车的燃料，美国亦不例外。可见瓶装煤气是比汽油、柴油更经济的燃料。煤气发生炉用的固体燃料的价格，以热量计，远比液体燃料低廉。发生炉煤气车虽是修理、保养费用较高，但包括燃料、保养、修理、管理等各种费用的总的运输费用，大致和汽油车的相同。江苏、浙江的煤价比华北高，但这两省的发生炉煤气车运输成本以往比汽油车略低，近来比汽油车略高。这是由于汽车用的无烟煤不作工业用煤看待，价格较高，质量不能如工业用煤一样得到保证所致。当我们考虑到载重汽车用了煤，就可以节省油，因而把汽车用煤（包括无烟煤、半焦、褐煤）也作工业用煤对待，那就可以降低煤气车的运输成本，提高煤气车的动力性和经济性。
    采用代用燃料后载重汽车的功率会不会降低？改用丙烷、丁烷等液化燃气后，汽车的功率可以提高；改用发生炉煤气后功率会降低，但汽车难得在最大功率下行驶，所以汽车的运输能力降低得比最大功率少，而且换用专为用发生炉煤气设计的煤气机后可以维持汽车的原有功率。甲烷、丙烷、焦炉煤气、发生炉煤气等可燃气体的辛烷数各不相同，但都比载重车用汽油的辛烷数高，这些气体在发动机始动时也不易在发动机内凝结。所以改用这些气体，应当按照它们的性能更改汽缸盖，才能使发动机充分发出功率。
    采用代用燃料后汽车的寿命如何？采用天然煤气、焦炉煤气、照明煤气以及丙烷、丁烷、丙烯、丁烯都可以减少汽缸的磨耗，延长汽车的寿命。采用发生炉煤气，如滤清不好，会降低汽车的寿命，但采用适当的滤清器后，发生炉煤气车的寿命可以不低于汽油车和柴油车。
    为了迅速推广代用燃料的采用，发动机的更改可以从提高压缩比开始，进而另制适用于煤气机的汽缸盖，包括汽缸盖上的零件。在最后阶段才生产专门设计的煤气机。在各个阶段都要注意和汽油机零件的最大程度的互换性。
    如在现生产厂生产煤气车会不会打乱生产秩序或延长总装配时间？不会。即使就和汽油车差别最大的发生炉煤气车来说，在总装配线上发生炉的装配可以简化到旋紧三只螺栓。这道工作还可以和其它工作同时进行。到了总装配线的末端，只要挂上一个装在拖斗上的气化正常的煤气发生炉，汽车就可以开走。挂上拖斗，接上通煤气的橡皮管，用不到两分钟。所以煤气车的总装配时间不会比汽油车长。装有发生炉的拖斗还可以随司机来往于总装配线和火车站之间。煤气车本身上的发生炉可以不生火。所以在总装配线不需生炉子，到了火车站装上货车前也不需熄炉子。因此在总装配线装配煤气车时可以没有烟、没有汽油味，空气比装配汽油车时好。
    目前的问题是，对采用代用燃料的认识还不一致，研究工作还需加强
    目前存在的问题：首先对于在公路运输方面应当大力节约油料、采用代用燃料，认识还不一致。因此代用燃料的研究难于排上队，原来研究这方面的人往往调做其它工作，不能完成研究代用燃料的任务。应用化学方面没有单位参加代用燃料的研究。使用单位对煤气的压缩，使用有顾虑，缺乏二百和三百大气压的煤气瓶，缺乏煤气压缩机。某处煤气公司原有的、大修后还可以用的压缩机修理排不上队，以至研究机构准备好的压缩煤气车，只要充上气，就可以进行试车，却长期不能实现充气的要求。这些都是大跃进中难免的现象，但明确了需要用代用燃料以后，一切问题就不难迎刃而解。
    为了贯彻周总理和李副总理对于公路运输方面所作的指示，首先要求有关方面有统一的认识，体会到节约油料、采用代用燃料的重要性，不是落后，而是用两条腿走路。在公路运输方面采用代用燃料的研究最好由科学技术委员会组织一机部、交通部、石油工业部、煤炭工业部和有煤气的城市的公用局协作进行，得到的成果从速推广应用，关键性的问题列入一九五九年的课题计划，进行研究，请一机部生产二百大气压的煤气瓶及少量装在充气车上的三百大气压的煤气瓶，供应煤气压缩机，请煤气公司、公共汽车公司和运输公司协商铺设管道。这样可以为陆路运输采用代用燃料铺平道路。
    这次大会我觉得是我们决心完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的誓师大会。我一定要加强争取党的领导，特别是本单位基层党委的领导，团结群众、团结青年，认真学习马克思列宁主义、定期下厂劳动、坚持自我改造、鼓起更大干劲，在完成和超额完成一九五九年继续大跃进的计划中尽我的心力。
    以上发言中不正确的地方请各位委员批评指正。
