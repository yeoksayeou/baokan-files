Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 12th. After two days of group discussions and regional activities, the special session of the World Peace Council continued its plenary speeches this afternoon. Six representatives spoke at the meeting. Representatives from Asian and African countries sharply criticized the West's brutal imperialist and colonialist policies towards the people of Asia and Africa in their speeches.

Han Xueye, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, pointed out that the continuous upsurge of the peace movement and the national independence movement in the past decade has foiled the imperialists' war attempts. He also condemned the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism in South Korea and some Southeast Asian countries at the meeting.

Asambi, the representative of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee, introduced the activities of the Asian-African Solidarity Committee at the meeting. He emphasized that the development of the national independence movement has strengthened the peace movement. Therefore, one of the main tasks of the peace movement is to support the growth of the national independence movement and counter the attacks of imperialism and colonialism.

Italian representative Mencaraglia pointed out at the meeting that it is necessary to unite all progressive forces and carry out extensive mass movements to oppose fascist war conspiracies and atomic armament. He also spoke about the struggle of the Italian public against the establishment of American missile bases.

Reverend Frichman, the U.S. representative, introduced the struggle for peace waged by the American church and the American people to the representatives. He pointed out that in the United States, due to large-scale war propaganda and the crazy persecution of peace fighters, it is difficult to carry out active struggles for peace on a large scale. But this does not mean that American peace fighters have laid down their arms. On the contrary, they are now working hard to unite the broad masses of Americans to fight for peace. He also presented gifts to the meeting on behalf of the U.S. delegation. His speech won warm applause from the representatives.

The meeting will close tomorrow, and the plenary session will continue tonight.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 12th. The World Peace Council meeting continued its plenary session tonight. Thirteen peace representatives from capitalist countries spoke at the meeting. They accused the aggression of U.S., British, and French imperialism and the reactionary policies of their governments of threatening the peaceful lives of the people, and vividly described the heroic struggles of the people of various countries to defend peace and strive for progress, democracy, and independence.

Brazilian representative, the famous physicist Shenberg, powerfully demonstrated the harm of American nuclear weapons tests to the peaceful life of the people.

French representative Soukier, when talking about the French colonial war against Algeria, pointed out that when the Algerian people are persecuted, the French people cannot be free either.

Israeli representative Dufic Dubi used the experience of the Israeli peace movement to illustrate that the struggle against imperialism and for national independence is an inseparable part of the peace movement.

As of tonight, a total of more than fifty representatives from various regions have spoken at the plenary session of this meeting, among whom representatives from Asia, Africa, and Latin America account for a large proportion. The representatives spoke about major issues related to peace in the current international situation, especially the German question. They unanimously believe that the current national independence movement and the peace movement have merged into one, and the root of the evil of war is imperialism and colonialism. Many people also spoke at the meeting about the importance of mobilizing the masses to strive for the participation of broad strata in the struggle to defend peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to TASS, Stockholm: Soviet Ambassador to Sweden Gusev held a reception on the 12th for the Soviet delegation attending the special session of the World Peace Council.

Those who attended the reception included Korneychuk, Tikhonov, Shostakovich, Kotov, Polevoi, and other members of the Soviet delegation, as well as members of other countries' delegations, as well as outstanding leaders of the world peace movement, including Lenin International Peace Prize winners Du Bois (United States), Madame Gordon (France), and Andrine (Sweden).
