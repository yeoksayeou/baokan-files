Xinhua News Agency, 13th May. TASS Moscow, 12th May. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko made a speech at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference on the 12th regarding the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the Foreign Ministers Conference. The full text of the speech is as follows:

    Before studying the issues on the agenda of this meeting, we should discuss the issue of the members participating in the meeting. I am referring to the participation of the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic in the meeting.

    You will recall that the Soviet government stated from the outset that Poland and Czechoslovakia must participate in these negotiations on matters relating to Germany, including a peace treaty with Germany and the situation in West Berlin. In the exchange of notes between the governments of our countries prior to the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, all parties have acknowledged that the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic have legitimate and direct interests in the issues to be discussed in Geneva. At the same time, it was agreed by all parties that the final decision on the participation of the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic in the meeting should be made by the meeting based on the direct relationship of these two countries to the resolution of the above-mentioned issues.

    The Soviet delegation wants to emphasize very definitely that the question of Poland and Czechoslovakia participating in our meeting is not a procedural question, but a question of great political significance. The correct solution to this question is an important prerequisite for guaranteeing the success of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and at the same time, it is the minimum fairness required for the people of these two European countries, because their vital interests are indeed inseparable from the resolution of issues related to Germany on a peaceful basis.

    Some may ask: Why exactly are Poland and Czechoslovakia being proposed to participate in this meeting? Are there no other countries that have a stake in making peace with Germany and improving the situation in West Berlin? Of course, the Soviet government has always believed that the failure to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and the abnormal situation in West Berlin affect the interests of many countries, not just European countries. It is from this point of view that the Soviet Union has proposed convening a peace conference to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, believing that the conference should invite all countries that sent armed forces to participate in the struggle against Hitler's Germany. However, if you ask which countries, in addition to the four major powers and the two Germanys, have the most right to participate in the preparatory work for resolving the German question at this stage, then without a doubt, Poland and Czechoslovakia can and should be proposed.

    It is enough to point out the following: these two countries were the first victims of aggression by Hitler's Germany in the last world war. They suffered the various scourges of war and Hitler's occupation for longer than other countries. The war machine of German militarism left particularly cruel marks on the land of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Majdanek, Auschwitz, and Lidice will forever be tragic symbols in human memory of the disaster of fascist barbarism, a disaster of the Second World War planned and provoked by the Hitlerite aggressors.

    Sometimes one hears the argument that it is not enough to let the representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia participate in the discussion of the German question not as equal members, but in some other capacity, such as observers. But, may I ask those who make these arguments: were the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia "observers" during the hard years of resisting the Hitlerite aggressors? Did they not actively participate in this struggle, but stood by and watched? We all know very well that this was not the case at all.

    From the beginning to the end of the war, the children of the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia fought heroically alongside our armies against the fascist aggressors at home and abroad, on the Eastern and Western fronts. Everyone knows that they contributed to the common cause of defeating Germany. Polish and Czechoslovak soldiers wrote more than just a glorious page in the history of fighting the Hitlerite bandits.

    No one can ignore the fact that the leaders of fascist Germany openly proposed the goal of physically exterminating the Polish nation, and they did so, resulting in the innocent sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Poles in the last war. The people of Poland and Czechoslovakia earned the right to actively participate in resolving issues related to Germany with their own blood. They cannot entrust anyone to resolve these issues, because it concerns the vital interests of Poland and Czechoslovakia, and their future.

    Poland and Czechoslovakia are not only direct neighbors of Germany. They have been the object of German militarist aggression more than once. Therefore, it is understandable that Poland and Czechoslovakia are particularly concerned about resolving the German question as soon as possible and on the basis of permanently preventing military conflicts in Europe. Poland and Czechoslovakia have repeatedly issued statements on this, including statements made as far back as the Potsdam Conference, when the leaders of the Allied countries gathered for the first international conference after the victory over Germany to summarize the war and point out ways to prevent Germany from launching another aggression.

    Poland and Czechoslovakia have repeatedly emphasized their interests in resolving the German question since then, and they fully adhere to this position now.

    It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of peace in Europe will depend to a great extent on the future relationship between Germany and Czechoslovakia and Poland. After the Second World War, the Polish government and the Czechoslovak government repeatedly proposed arranging friendly mutual relations with Germany. However, the hand of peaceful friendship extended by Poland and Czechoslovakia to its neighbor - Germany - was only accepted by one Germany - the German Democratic Republic. West Germany has so far refused to establish normal relations with these two countries.

    Of course, if the problem was merely that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany was unwilling to establish diplomatic relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern European countries, then there would be no need to talk about it at an international conference. Every country is free to establish mutual relations with other countries as long as it deems it necessary, but it must be frankly said that the attitude of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on this issue can hardly be considered wise.

    But in reality, we are talking about something much more important, talking about the vital interests and security of the two countries bordering Germany. We will never forget that in West Germany, the only country that advocates redrawing the political map of Europe, there are certain groups that make no secret of their vengeful intentions towards Poland and Czechoslovakia.

    This alone is enough to show that we have no right to reject the legitimate demands of Czechoslovakia and Poland to participate in the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany and the discussion of other related issues.

    Finally, I would like to point out one more situation, from which it can be seen that the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia is not only legitimate and justified in all aspects, but also indispensable for the success of our meeting. It does not take much time to prove that the entire foreign policy pursued by the Czechoslovak Republic and the Polish People's Republic, as well as all their words and deeds on major international issues, whether within the United Nations or in other occasions, convincingly prove that these two countries are very active and always unwaveringly defending the cause of peace, and warmly supporting the relaxation of international tension and ensuring the security of the people of all European countries.

    Some people may be worried that the participation of these countries in our meeting will change the ratio of the number of participating countries in favor of one side, and thus are prepared to sacrifice the legitimate interests of Poland and Czechoslovakia. However, this way of dealing with things cannot be agreed upon in any way. The task before us is extremely important, and we have no time to do this kind of arithmetic. Besides, everyone knows that in our meeting, as in other similar meetings, the problem is not solved by calculating the number of votes.

    From all the above, considering from all aspects of politics, law, and morality, it shows the necessity of allowing the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic to participate in this Foreign Ministers Conference with full rights. It would be very unfair to the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia if this issue is not resolved in this way.

    For the same reasons, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to resolve the issue of the participation of the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic in this meeting from the beginning of the meeting.

### 葛罗米柯在外长会议上作重要发言  波捷两国有充分理由参加外长会议

    葛罗米柯在外长会议上作重要发言
    波捷两国有充分理由参加外长会议
    波、捷受希特勒德国之害最久，对战胜法西斯贡献很大，同解决德国问题有切身利害关系。
    新华社13日讯  塔斯社莫斯科12日电：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯12日在日内瓦外长会议上就波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加外长会议问题作了发言。发言全文如下：
    在研究这次会议议程上的问题之前，我们应该讨论一下参加会议的成员问题。我指的是波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国参加会议的问题。
    你们记得，苏联政府从一开始就声明，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克必须参加这次就有关德国问题，其中包括对德和约和西柏林局势问题举行的谈判。在召开外长会议前，我们几个国家政府之间的照会来往中，各方已经承认，波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国对这次将在日内瓦讨论的问题有着合法的和直接的利益。同时，各方议定，关于波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国参加会议的问题，由会议从这两个国家对解决上述问题的直接关系出发来作出最后决定。
    苏联代表团要十分肯定地着重指出，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加我们这个会议的问题并不是一个程序问题，而是一个有重大政治意义的问题。这个问题的正确解决是保证外长会议成功的重要前提之一，同时也是对这两个欧洲国家人民的最起码的公正态度所要求的，因为他们的切身利益同在和平的基础上解决有关德国问题的确是分不开的。
    可能有人会问：为什么恰恰提出波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加这次会议的问题呢？不是还有其他国家也跟同德国媾和及改善西柏林局势有利害关系吗？当然如此，苏联政府一向认为，没有缔结对德和约以及西柏林局势的不正常影响到许多国家的利益，而且不仅仅是欧洲国家的利益。正是从这点出发，苏联才建议召开和会来缔结对德和约，认为和会应当邀请所有曾经派武装部队参加反希特勒德国斗争的国家出席。但是，如果要问，除了四大国和两个德国以外，有哪些国家最有权利在现阶段参加解决德国问题的准备工作，那末毫无疑问，可以而且应当提出的就是波兰和捷克斯洛伐克了。
    只要指出下面这一点就足够了：这两个国家在上次世界大战中首先成为希特勒德国侵略的受害者。它们遭受战争和希特勒占领的种种祸害的时间比别国要长。德国军国主义的战争机器在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的土地上留下了特别残酷的痕迹。麦丹尼克、奥斯威辛和利迪泽在人类的记忆中将永远是法西斯野蛮灾祸的悲惨象征，这场灾祸是希特勒侵略者所策划和挑起的第二次世界大战带给人民的。
    有时听到这样的说法：让波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表不作为平等的一员，而是以某种另外的身份，譬如以观察员的身份来参加德国问题的讨论，这还不够吗。但是，请问那些发出这类论调的人：难道在抵抗希特勒侵略者的艰苦岁月里，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的人民是“观察员”吗，难道他们没有积极参加这场斗争，而是在那里袖手旁观吗？我们大家都很清楚，当时的情况完全不是这样。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国人民的儿女从战争开始到战争结束，在国内外，在东方战线和西方战线曾经同我们的军队并肩跟法西斯侵略者英勇作战，他们对战胜德国的共同事业作出了贡献，这是大家都知道的。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的军人在对希特勒匪帮作战的历史上写下的不仅仅是光荣的一页。
    任何人都无法无视这样的事实：法西斯德国的领导人曾经明目张胆地提出在肉体上消灭波兰民族的目标，而且这样做了，结果，在上次大战中有成千上万的波兰人无辜地牺牲了。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国人民用自己的鲜血争得了积极参加解决有关德国问题的权利。它们不能转托任何人来解决这些问题，因为，这关系到波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的切身利益，关系到它们的未来。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克不仅仅是德国的直接邻国。它们曾经不止一次地成为德国军国主义侵略野心的对象。因此，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克特别关心尽快地、在永远杜绝在欧洲发生军事冲突的基础上，解决德国问题，这是可以理解的。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克曾一再就此发表声明，其中包括远在波茨坦会议期间就发表过的声明，当时，盟国的领导人聚首一堂召开战胜德国以后的第一次国际会议来总结战争和指出堵塞德国再次发动侵略的途径。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克后来曾再三强调它们在解决德国问题方面的利害关系，它们现在也完全坚持这样的主张。
    可以毫不夸张地说，欧洲和平的命运在不小的程度上将取决于德国同捷克斯洛伐克和波兰今后的关系如何。在第二次世界大战以后，波兰政府和捷克斯洛伐克政府曾多次建议同德国安排友好的相互关系。但是，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克向自己的邻国——德国伸出的和平友谊之手只被一个德国——德意志民主共和国所接受。西德直到现在甚至拒绝同这两个国家建立正常关系。
    当然，如果问题仅仅在于，德意志联邦共和国政府不愿意同波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及东欧其他国家建立外交关系，那就无须在国际会议上谈到这一点了。每个国家都可以自由地同别国建立相互关系，只要它认为必要，不过必须坦率地说，德意志联邦共和国政府在这个问题上的态度很难被认为是明智的。
    但是，在实际上，这里谈的是重要得多的事情，谈的是和德国毗邻的两个国家的切身利益和安全。我们一刻也不会忘记，在西德这个唯一主张重画欧洲政治地图的国家中，有某些集团毫不掩饰对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克怀着复仇意图。
    仅此一端就足以说明，我们没有权利拒绝捷克斯洛伐克和波兰提出的关于参加准备对德和约和讨论其他与此有关的问题的合法要求。
    最后，我想再指出一个情况，从这个情况看来，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的参加不仅在一切方面都是合法和有理由的，并且也是为了使我们的会议开得圆满所不可缺的。不需花很多时间就能证明，捷克斯洛伐克共和国和波兰人民共和国所奉行的整个外交政策以及它们在重大国际问题上的一切言行，无论是在联合国范围内或者在其他场合的言行，都令人信服地证明，这两个国家都非常积极和始终不渝地在捍卫和平事业，热烈拥护缓和国际紧张局势和确保欧洲各国人民的安全。
    可能有某些人耽心这些国家参加我们的会议会改变参加国的数量对比关系而有利于某一方，因而就准备牺牲波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的合法利益。但是，这种对待事情的态度无论如何都不能使人同意的。摆在我们面前的任务极其重大，我们无暇来做这种算术，何况，大家知道，在我们这次会议上，同其他类似的会议一样，问题不是用计算票数的办法来解决的。
    从上述一切看出，从政治、法律和道义的一切方面来考虑，都说明有必要让波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国有充分权利参加这次外长会议。这个问题不这样解决，对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国人民是非常不公平的。
    苏联政府根据同样的理由认为，必须解决波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国在这次会议一开始就参加会议的问题。
