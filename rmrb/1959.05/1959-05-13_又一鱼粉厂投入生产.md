    Another Fishmeal Factory Goes Into Production
    Following the completion of the Shanghai and Zhoushan fishmeal factories, another large fishmeal factory in China—the Qikou Fishmeal Factory in Huanghua County, Hebei Province—has been completed and put into production. This is a factory that uses mostly mechanized production. The entire factory has only sixty workers, and produces 12,000 jin of fishmeal per day. The workers stated that in addition to completing this year's fishmeal production tasks, they also plan to produce fish floss, fish soy sauce, fish sausage, fish canned goods and other non-staple foods, and will also use offal to make fish fertilizer to support agricultural production.

    又一鱼粉厂投入生产
    继上海、舟山鱼粉厂建成后，我国又一大鱼粉厂——歧口鱼粉厂在河北省黄骅县建成，并投入生产。这是一个大部分使用机械生产的工厂，全厂仅有六十名工人，每日生产鱼粉达一万二千斤。工人们表示，除了完成今年鱼粉生产任务以外，还准备生产鱼肉松、鱼酱油、鱼香肠、鱼罐头等副食品，还将利用下水制造鱼肥，支援农业生产。
