Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd dispatch from Moscow: TASS reported that the Soviet government held a grand reception in the Grand Kremlin Palace on the 21st for Afghan Prime Minister Daoud's visit to the Soviet Union.

    Attending the reception were Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Pospelov, Kosygin, Polyansky, as well as people from all walks of life.

    In his speech, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev, on behalf of the Soviet government, welcomed the Afghan Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union. He said that the beneficial talks we have had further strengthen our belief that your visit to the Soviet Union will take a step forward on the road to further developing the friendly and truly good-neighborly relations between our two countries.

    Khrushchev then said that we are pleased that the friendly direct contact between the leaders of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan will become increasingly close, and we will better understand each other, which will greatly strengthen mutual understanding and consolidate friendship between countries.

    Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government sincerely respects Afghanistan's peaceful and neutral policy. He emphasized that Soviet-Afghan cooperation has already brought good results to Afghanistan's economic development and progress. Khrushchev said that the Soviet government is still ready to work for this noble cause in the future.

    Khrushchev drew attention to the recent rumors spread by some foreigners, saying that Soviet troops had entered Afghan territory. He went on to say that it seems that these gentlemen are measuring the relationship between our two countries by their own standards. They are trying to use this slander to cover up their ugly deeds in the Middle East, the establishment of foreign military bases, and the piecing together of disintegrating military blocs.

    Khrushchev then pointed out that the Soviet Union is helping Afghanistan explore for oil in the northern regions of Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan government.

    Khrushchev said, may our relations continue to be an example of fraternal cooperation between countries with different political and social systems in the future.

    Next, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud delivered a reply speech. He said that the mutual understanding and friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union is a good example for the people of all countries in the world.

    Speaking of the rumors spread by certain British newspapers about the so-called entry of Soviet troops into Afghanistan, Prime Minister Daoud said that anyone who knows something about our people, or about our country and our history, knows very well how unfounded such rumors are.

    Prime Minister Daoud pointed out that, in short, the establishment of military bases or the gathering of armed forces on foreign territories is something that may happen to those countries that are negotiating military treaties and agreements.

    Prime Minister Daoud continued, "I clearly state that Afghanistan has neither wished nor does it now wish to participate in such activities and agreements, nor does it wish to turn its territory into military bases." He said, "Our Soviet friends have always been frank and sincere in their words and deeds in their relations with us. Their cooperation with us is not attached to any conditions, and they fully understand and respect our fundamental principles."

Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd dispatch: TASS reported that Afghan Prime Minister Daoud, after visiting the Soviet Union, left Moscow on the 22nd aboard a "Tu-104" aircraft and returned home via Tashkent.

    Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov and others went to the airport to see Prime Minister Daoud off.

    Also present at the airport were Afghan Ambassador to the Soviet Union Hakim Khan, members of the Afghan government delegation who are conducting economic negotiations with the Soviet Union, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union.

    In his speech at the airport, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev said that although Prime Minister Daoud's visit to the Soviet Union this time was short, it was of great benefit to further developing Soviet-Afghan relations and strengthening peace.

    In his speech, Afghan Prime Minister Daoud said that although my visit to the Soviet Union this time was very short, our contact will undoubtedly strengthen the cause of peace and the cooperation and friendship between our two countries.

    Prime Minister Daoud finally wished the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan to be eternal.

    苏联政府宴请阿富汗首相
    赫鲁晓夫表示将加强苏阿两国的合作
    达乌德严斥英报就苏阿关系捏造谣言
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府21日在大克里姆林宫为阿富汗首相达乌德访问苏联举行盛大招待会。
    出席招待会的有苏联共产党和政府领导人勃烈日涅夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、科兹洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、波斯别洛夫、柯西金、波利扬斯基以及各界人士。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在讲话中代表苏联政府表示欢迎阿富汗首相访问苏联。他说，我们大家进行的有益的会谈，更加巩固了我们的信念：你们访问苏联将在进一步发展我们两国友好和真正睦邻关系的道路上迈进一步。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们满意的是，苏联和阿富汗国家领导人友好的直接接触将日益密切，我们将更好地相互了解，而这会大大加强相互谅解和巩固国与国之间的友谊。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联政府真诚地尊重阿富汗的和平政策和中立政策。他强调指出，苏联和阿富汗的合作已经给阿富汗的经济发展和进步带来良好结果。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府今后仍准备为这一崇高事业而努力。
    赫鲁晓夫提醒注意，最近有些外国人士造谣，说什么苏军开入阿富汗境内。他接着说，看来，这些先生是用自己的尺度来衡量我们两国的关系。他们企图用这种谰言来掩饰他们在中东的丑恶勾当、建立外国军事基地和把分崩离析的军事集团拼凑在一起。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，苏联根据阿富汗政府的请求帮助阿富汗勘察阿富汗北部地区的石油。
    赫鲁晓夫说，愿我们的关系今后继续成为不同政治制度和社会制度国家兄弟合作的榜样。
    接着，阿富汗首相达乌德致答词。他说，阿富汗和苏联两国之间的相互谅解和友谊，是世界各国人民的好榜样。
    在谈到某些英国报纸散布的所谓苏联部队开入阿富汗境内的这种谣言时，达乌德首相说，凡是多少了解一些我国人民，或是了解我国和我国历史的人，都非常清楚地知道，这种谣言是多么没有根据。
    达乌德首相指出，总之，在别国领土上建立军事基地或集结武装部队，是那些正在就军事条约和协定进行谈判的国家可能发生的事情。
    达乌德首相接着说，我明确地声明，阿富汗过去和现在都不希望参与这种活动和协定，不希望把本国领土变成军事基地。他说，我们苏联朋友在同我们的关系中的言行一向是坦率和真诚的，他们同我们的合作并不附带任何条件，他们完全理解并且尊重我们的基本原则。
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社讯：阿富汗首相达乌德在苏联进行访问后，已于22日乘“图—104”飞机离开莫斯科，途经塔什干回国。
    到机场欢送达乌德首相的有苏联共产党和政府领导人赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫等。
    到机场送行的还有阿富汗驻苏联大使哈基姆汗和正在同苏联进行经济谈判的阿富汗政府代表团成员以及各国驻苏联的外交使节。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在机场讲话中说，达乌德首相这一次在苏联访问，时间虽然不长，但对进一步发展苏阿两国关系和加强和平有很大好处。
    阿富汗首相达乌德在讲话中说，我这次访问苏联的时间虽然很短，但是，我们之间的接触无疑地会加强和平事业以及我们两国之间的合作和友谊。
    达乌德首相最后祝苏联和阿富汗两国人民的友谊永恒。
