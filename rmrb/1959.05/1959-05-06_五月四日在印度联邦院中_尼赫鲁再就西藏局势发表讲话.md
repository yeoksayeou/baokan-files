Xinhua News Agency, May 5th. According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the Federal Council (the upper house of the Indian Parliament) on May 4th following a debate on the Tibetan situation.

In his speech, Nehru said, "Unfortunately, in some other countries, especially in China, there may not be a full understanding of our way of doing things here in our parliament or outside parliament; that is to say, they may not fully understand that here, everyone has the right to say—here in parliament, indeed even outside parliament and in newspapers—everyone has the right to say whatever he or she wants, some restrictions regarding not allowing slander or defamation are very, very broad, what he or she says may in fact be condemning the government, and it often is, it does not represent government policy. I say this because China has raised—has raised objections to the speeches made by members of parliament inside or outside parliament or in newspapers." He said, "The situation here is different from the situation in China."

Referring to the incident in Bombay where someone insulted a portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, Nehru said, "First, to express again my regret about this matter, and also to state the facts about this incident that we know and also correctly understand—we should understand these facts a little more clearly than those sitting in Beijing—however, it is very strange that in this small matter, our account of the facts has not been fully accepted by the Beijing government, which is surprising. We are here, we should know the things that happen in our country, the facts, more clearly than others, whatever other opinions there may be. However, this is a very regrettable incident, and the government obviously had nothing to do with it."

Nehru then spoke about his speech on the Tibetan situation in the People's House (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) on April 27th, saying, "As far as important facts are concerned, I have talked about them in that statement, and I really have nothing to add, although after that statement was issued, it was not accepted—I am referring to the facts, not even the facts were fully accepted by the Chinese authorities and the Chinese press, which is unfortunate, because I would like to say again that regarding what happens in India, I imagine that we can understand it more clearly than the Chinese authorities, who probably can only obtain information through their intelligence personnel who may be stationed in Kalimpong or elsewhere. But I do not want to argue about these minor issues, because the problem before us is much more serious and much deeper than the Tibetan issue—the entire Tibetan issue—although the Tibetan issue is important, and the events we are discussing cast a shadow on Tibet. This shows that they are indeed deeper than that, so our words and actions must be especially cautious. Now I think there must be limitations and responsibilities on what people say on such occasions."

He added, "First of all, we must recognize what our purpose is. I hope that our purpose is not simply to condemn someone or some government or some statement. I am very sorry to say that recently in China, there has been too much of this practice of condemnation and slogan-shouting, and some of the slogans are very unusual. But I think we should not be too sensitive, and get restless over a few slogans in a moment of excitement. We must never be led away from our main path, because this will have very great consequences in the future."

In response to the question of whether India has adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence since the Tibetan rebellion, Nehru said, "Sometimes I doubt whether the words we use contain the same meaning, or whether we have some different meanings in our minds, but—I am not saying that I am superior to others—as far as India is concerned, we sincerely strive to abide by these principles, and I think we have not violated any principle. It is not for me to stand up and criticize other countries or defend other countries." Nehru went on to say, "I hope to assure the honorable member on the opposite side that as far as the government is concerned—I cannot speak for every Indian citizen—we abide by these principles, and we will strive to abide by them, regardless of whether other countries do so. Some people definitely—as (Member) Gupta said—are using the clamor of these events in and related to Tibet to say that India will now have to consider to what extent it can adhere to its policy of non-alignment. All this shows a strange misunderstanding of our way of thinking in terms of policy. Non-alignment—although the word itself is a negative word—still has a positive meaning. No matter what happens, we do not intend to enter into a military alliance with any country. I want to make this very clear, because once we abandon the idea of non-alignment, we immediately lose every anchor we rely on, and we will drift with the tide. We can rely on someone or some country. But in this way we lose the self-respect of our own country. If a person loses his self-respect, that is losing something very precious. Therefore, this idea of always wanting to get something from this country to that country is undesirable. This may not be very relevant to the topic. In Pakistan, people often say, let us formulate a common defense policy. I am completely in favor of resolving our disputes with Pakistan and living a normal, friendly, neighborly life. We are working towards this. But when people say we have a common defense policy, I don't understand. Against whom? Immediately the question arises: 'Against whom is this common defense policy directed?' Are we to become members of the Baghdad Pact or the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or some organization? We do not want a common defense policy, which is almost another way of saying some kind of military alliance. Our entire policy has always been against this concept. We want to establish friendly relations with Pakistan. We hope we will get this relationship. But we do not want to link ourselves, our ideas, our policies with other countries, and get involved in military defense and offense and things like that." He also said, "Our policy towards the People's Republic of China's participation in the United Nations remains the same as in the past." He said, "We do not change our policy because we are angry about certain things that have happened in China. To do so would mean that we do not have a definite policy, and therefore the temporary events in the world would cause us to change."

He expressed the hope that the various difficulties we are currently facing due to the Tibetan incident will gradually disappear. However, he said, "What we have been striving for all these years, what can be said to be embodied—if you will—in the Panchsheel or Bandung (principles), has been greatly damaged in people's minds, which is not only a tragedy for Tibet, but also a greater tragedy for many of us." He said that these words, like all other words—Bandung, Panchsheel, whatever word you use, it doesn't matter—have begun to lose their luster and are beginning to be misused meaninglessly; in fact, even a word like "peace," as it is used now, is almost like thunder or a small-scale war. Sometimes, what is important is the way it is used—the way. I increasingly believe that means are even more important than ends. They tell us that the way a person does things is even more important than what he does. Therefore, I feel extremely sad about this recent development and those words now being said in China—the accusations against India." He said, "I really think that these are accusations that cannot withstand scrutiny at all. What have we done about the Tibetan issue besides making some speeches and things like that?"

He said, "We received the Dalai Lama and his entourage, and later we received thousands of refugees. We have granted them the right of asylum; as a sovereign state, we have every right to do so, and no one else can judge this except ourselves. This is recognized—I don't think anyone can deny this. Now, is someone saying that when the Dalai Lama asked for asylum, we should have refused? If someone outside of India said this, I can tell them—I don't know about the situation of a small group of the 400 million people in India; I doubt whether even only a few thousand people would agree with that policy—I can tell them this: If we refused to grant the Dalai Lama and his entourage asylum, hundreds of millions of Indians would be angry with our actions. Almost everyone in India—maybe a few don't—agrees with our policy. If we didn't do this, then from whatever point of view—political, humanitarian, or whatever—it would be impossible and completely wrong. Therefore, this is what we did. Of course, some people accuse us of being acquiescent in Kalimpong; Kalimpong is the command center of this Tibetan rebellion—I think this is the word they used. Now it is said that the command center has moved to Mussoorie—I know that words have lost their meaning, because I find it very difficult to deal with these accusations." He said, "This is a very serious accusation made against the leaders of a country. These accusations are made irresponsibly by the leaders of the people of a country that we not only respect and honor, but also consider to be particularly advanced in culture and etiquette and the elegant arts of civilization. This shocks me, because regardless of everything else, I have always respected the Chinese people, and I still respect them, because they have achieved great accomplishments, because they have a great culture and things like that. To say and do this kind of thing in a moment of impulse is extremely shocking to me. I hope this impulse will pass."

When recounting the events of the Tibetan rebellion as he knew them, Nehru emphasized that the Indian Consul-General in Lhasa did not want to interfere in the Tibetan situation. He said, "We drafted a telegram (to the Consul-General), this telegram was ready and could be sent at any time, the telegram said: 'Do not get involved in the events that have happened and are happening in Lhasa.' This was on the 14th (of March). This situation continued to develop. It was at that time, I think I said in the People's House, that there was a conflict of wills in Lhasa. Whether it is correct to say that, I do not know. The problem is that there was no real fighting at that time. The real fighting broke out a few days later. The fighting started on March 20th. How the fighting started, I do not know. Our Consul-General sitting in the consulate also does not know, and people cannot expect him to know when the fighting started. As we now know, he did not know at the time. On the evening of the 17th, the Dalai Lama and his entourage left Lhasa in considerable secrecy. According to them, at four o'clock in the afternoon on the 17th, two shells or bombs of some kind landed in a lake in the Summer Palace. Oh, this made them think 'now is the final moment, now the palace is going to be bombarded, war is going to break out everywhere', so they left Lhasa."

He added, "As far as I know—I am not sure—even at that time, he did not have a full plan to leave Tibet. But that plan must have been formed later when Lhasa was bombarded. In short, in that week from the 11th to the 20th or 21st, in that period of about ten days, this is the news we received. We could not do anything about it, and" before (March) 10th or 11th, apart from naturally knowing that various opposing forces were active in Lhasa and Tibet, we knew nothing about the situation. Then, we faced the question of the Dalai Lama possibly coming here, and we decided that we should receive him. He came. The House may know that I had refused, but people repeatedly asked me: 'Are you going to open the doors to however many refugees come from Tibet?' I refused to do so, although I knew in my heart that I could not seriously refuse to grant asylum to people in very difficult circumstances, I could not do this; but I was not willing to say this at that time, so as not to attract people to flock to India from all over the place. The simple situation of how things happened and what we did is like this. Now we are called expansionists and imperialists and all kinds of names, I think this will not have any real impact on what we are like; however, it does make us sad because these accusations come from the mouths of those we consider to be friends."

Nehru said, "Now I want to tell you only a few facts. Another unusual thing has appeared in the Beijing newspapers. They are now recalling the events of 1950, that is, recalling some of the memorandums we issued when the Chinese army entered Tibet. These were very polite memorandums. The replies to these memorandums were not very polite, but the problem now is that they mention these memorandums, saying that what we wrote to them at that time was written after consultation with the British government, saying that although we claimed to be independent, we were actually acting as stooges or tools of the British government. This is of course completely wrong and untrue. There was no consultation with the British government at all. Our views on Tibet were different from those of the British government."

Referring to Panchen Erdeni's speech at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on April 29th, Nehru said, "I felt quite sad when I read a speech by someone who had been our guest, a speech that was so lacking in poise and dignity. I did not know some of the small things he said, that his staff did not get proper accommodation somewhere. I cannot answer whether there was some difficulty in Aurangabad or somewhere like that, because the followers of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama were so many - there were hundreds of people. It is not so easy to make as many preparations as we wanted to make."

He said, "Now, as far as we are concerned, we have not interfered from Kalimpong, or from Mussoorie, or from anywhere else. We have exercised our unquestionable right to grant asylum. I have said that the Dalai Lama is a completely free man, who can go anywhere in India, or return to Tibet." He also said, "The Dalai Lama has not been hijacked here, he did not enter India under any hijacking, but only hijacked by circumstances, if you will - forced by the situation. After meeting and talking with him, I can definitely say, based on what I personally know, that he is staying in India, even staying in Mussoorie, of his own free will. I would respectfully say that anyone who denies this fact is completely unaware of the facts and is speaking casually without understanding the situation."

He said, "In addition, members of parliament may have seen in the newspaper headlines - because the headlines used some strange words - that I once said that I would be happy if the Dalai Lama returned to Tibet. I have said this. Someone asked me the question, and I said, 'I would naturally be happy if he returned in a dignified manner.' But this does not at all mean that I am going to push the Dalai Lama out, or put him in a difficult situation. It is entirely up to him to decide what to do and when to do it. When I was with him, the only suggestion I made to him was: You have had a very difficult journey and a very troubling experience. As someone who is much older than you, may I suggest that you rest for a few days, quietly think about what has happened, and then do what you want to do."

In his speech, Nehru once again talked about his views on the Tibetan rebellion, saying, "I do not know exactly what happened in Tibet. But, as I said in my previous statement, according to China, this is quite a serious matter, a very large-scale matter. If one looks at the past history of Tibet and also looks at the surrounding environment, then one can very well imagine that, in addition to the so-called people who represent vested interests - there will be these people - in fact, there are many Tibetans - I can say that, whether they are a majority or a minority, but undoubtedly many people - since they have taken this step that they have taken, it really means a very dangerous step. In any case, things have happened, and people have strong feelings about this."

Nehru said that regarding "refugees," the latest situation is that there are now close to six thousand five hundred "refugees" passing through the Kameng area of the "Northeast Frontier Agency," one thousand five hundred are crossing Bhutan, and seven hundred have arrived in Sikkim - a total of about nine thousand people. The Bhutanese government has asked us to accept Tibetan "refugees" passing through their territory, and we have agreed to do so. In this way, we have about nine thousand "refugees," and we have assumed the responsibility of making some arrangements for them. Some of the refugees entered India with weapons. They were disarmed as soon as they entered India. He said that some of these "refugees" are temporarily housed in the Misamari camp in Assam, and others will be housed in camps built by West Bengal. He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed special officials to deal with the refugee issue.

He said, "We will not let them stay in the camps like prisoners for a long time. In fact, our instructions to the border officials are to tell the refugees: We are not responsible for maintaining their lives indefinitely." He said, "Naturally, when these people come in, we are to some extent responsible. We cannot let them wander around in India. There is also the problem that they cannot live in any place for a long time except in the colder climate conditions of the mountains - we simply cannot send them to other parts of India."

### 五月四日在印度联邦院中  尼赫鲁再就西藏局势发表讲话

　　五月四日在印度联邦院中
    尼赫鲁再就西藏局势发表讲话
    新华社5日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁5月4日在联邦院（印度议会上议院）就西藏局势进行辩论以后发表了讲话。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中说，“不幸的是，在一些别的国家，特别是在中国，关于我们在我们的议会这里或议会以外的行事方式也许没有得到充分的了解；这就是说，他们可能不完全了解，在这里，每个人都有权利说——在议会这里、的确还在议会以外和在报纸上——每个人都有权利想说什么就说什么，一些关于不许中伤或诽谤的限制是非常非常之宽的，他或她所说的话，事实上可能是谴责政府的，而它常常是这样的，它并不代表政府的政策。我之所以这样说，是因为中国对议员先生们在议会中或议会外或报纸上所发表的言论提出——已经提出异议。”他说，“这里的情况与中国的情况是不同的。”
    谈到在孟买有人侮辱毛泽东主席的画像时，尼赫鲁说，“首先是要再次表示我对这件事感到遗憾，同时也是要说明，我们所了解的并且也是正确了解的关于这一事件的事实——我们对这些事实应该比呆在北京的人了解得稍为清楚一些——然而，十分奇怪，在这件小事上，我们关于事实的说明没有为北京政府所完全接受，这是令人惊奇的。我们呆在这里，我们对我们国内所发生的事情，对于事实，应该知道得更清楚一些，不论其他人可能有什么样的意见。然而，这是一个非常令人遗憾的事件，政府同它显然没有任何关系。”
    尼赫鲁接着谈到他4月27日在人民院（印度议会下院）就西藏局势发表的谈话，他说，“就重要事实而论，我在那篇声明中都谈到了，我的确没有什么可补充的了，虽然在那篇声明发表以后，它没有被接受——我指的是事实，甚至事实也没有为中国当局和中国报界完全接受，这种情况是不幸的，因为我愿意再次说，关于印度发生的事情，我设想，我们是可以比中国当局了解得更清楚的，中国当局大概只能通过他们在噶伦堡或其他地方可能派有的情报人员获得情报。但是，我并不希望就这些次要的问题进行争论，因为我们面前的问题比西藏问题——整个西藏问题——要严重得多，要深刻得多，虽然西藏问题是重要的，而我们所讨论的事件对西藏投下了阴影。这表明，它们的确比那更为深刻，因此我们的言行必须特别谨慎。现在我认为人们在这种场合讲什么话要有限制也要负责。”
    他又说，“首先，我们必须认清我们的目的何在。我希望，我们的目的不是单单谴责某个人或者某个政府或者某句话。我很遗憾地说，最近在中国，这种谴责和提口号的做法是太多了，而且有的口号是十分异乎寻常的。但是，我认为我们不该太敏感，而在一时激动的情况下被几句口号弄得坐立不安。我们绝不能被人从我们的主要道路上引开，因为这在将来是会引起很大的后果的。”
    在答复关于西藏叛乱事件发生以后，印度是否遵守和平共处五项原则时，尼赫鲁说，“有时候我怀疑，我们所使用的言词究竟是包含同样的意思呢，还是在我们心目中有着某种不同的含义，可是——我并不是说我比别人优越——就印度来说，我们真诚地努力遵守这些原则，并且我认为，我们并没有违反任何原则。站起来批评别的国家或者为别的国家辩护不是由我做的事情。”尼赫鲁接着说：“我希望向对面的议员先生保证，就政府来说——我不能够代表印度每个老百姓讲话——我们遵守这些原则，并且我们将努力遵守它们，不管别的国家是否会这样做。有些人肯定地——如（议员）古普塔所说的——利用西藏境内以及与西藏有关的这些事件的叫嚷说，印度现在将不得不考虑，它能在多大程度上遵守不结盟政策。所有这一切表明对于我们在政策方面的思想方法有着奇怪的误解。不结盟——虽然这个字眼本身是一种消极的字眼——仍然有着积极的意义，不管发生什么样的事情，我们不打算与任何国家订立军事同盟，我要非常清楚地说明这一点，因为一旦我们放弃了不结盟的主意，我们就马上失去我们所依靠的每一只锚，我们便将随波逐流。我们可以依靠某人或某个国家。但是这样我们便失去我们自己国家的自尊。如果一个人失去了他的自尊，那就是失去了某种非常可贵的东西。因此，这种总是想从这个国家到那个国家得到某种东西的想法是要不得的。这也许是与本题不很相干的事。在巴基斯坦有人常常说，我们制订一个共同的防御政策吧。我完全赞成解决我们同巴基斯坦的纠纷，过一种正常的友好的睦邻的生活。我们为此而努力。但是，当人们说我们有一项共同的防御政策时，我就不明白了。对付谁呢？立即产生这样的问题：‘这种共同的防御政策是对付谁的呢？’我们是否要成为巴格达条约或东南亚条约组织或某种组织的成员？我们不希望有一种共同的防御政策，这种政策几乎是某种军事联盟的另一个说法。我们一向奉行的整个政策是反对这种观念的。我们希望同巴基斯坦建立友好关系。我们希望我们将得到这种关系。但是，我们不想把我们自己、我们的观念、我们的政策同其他国家连在一起，卷入军事防御和进攻以及诸如此类的事情。”他还说，“我们对待中国人民政府参加联合国的政策仍然和过去一样”。他说，“我们并不由于对中国发生的某些事情感到气愤而改变我们的政策。那样做将意味着，我们没有肯定的政策，因此世界上暂时发生的事情就使我们改变了。”
    他表示希望：目前我们由于西藏事件而不得不面临的各种困难将能渐渐消除。但是，他说，“我们所有这些年来一直为之努力的、可以说是寄寓——如果你愿意这样说的话——于潘查希拉或万隆（原则）的东西，在人们的心目中已经受到了极大的损害，这不仅对西藏来说是一个悲剧，而且对我们中间的许多人来说是一个更大的悲剧。”他说，这些字眼像所有其他的字眼一样——万隆，潘查希拉，无论你用什么字眼都没有什么关系——已经开始失去它们的光泽，开始被人们毫无意义地滥用；事实上，就像甚至“和平”这样的字眼，照现在这样的用法，也差不多已经像霹雳或者小规模战争一样了。有时候，重要的是使用它的方式——是方式。我愈来愈认为，手段甚至比目的更重要。它们告诉我们，一个人做事情的方法甚至比他做的事情更其重要。因此，我对最近这种事态发展和中国国内现在所说的那些话——对印度的指责——感到极为难过。他说，“我的确认为，这是一些一点经不起深究的指责，除了发表一些讲话之类的东西以外，我们关于西藏这件事情到底做了什么呢？”
    他说，“我们接待了达赖喇嘛和他的一行人，后来我们又接待了数千难民。我们已经给予他们避难权；作为主权国家，我们完全有权利这样做，除了我们自己以外，任何别人都不能对此加以判断，这是公认的事——我认为任何人都不能否认这一点。现在，是不是有人说，当达赖喇嘛要求给予避难权的时候，我们本来是应当拒绝的？如果是印度以外的某人这样说，我可以告诉他们——我对于四亿印度人民中的一小撮人的情况是不了解的；我怀疑是否甚至只有几千人会同意那种政策——我可以告诉他们这一点：如果我们拒绝给予达赖喇嘛和他的一行人避难权，数以亿计的印度人是会对我们的那种行动感到气愤的。几乎印度的每一个人都——也许有少数人不——赞同我们的政策，我们要是不这样做，那么无论从什么观点——政治观点、人道观点或随便你从什么观点——来看，那都会是不可能的事，完全错误的事。因此，我们就是这样做的。当然，有人指责我们在噶伦堡采取默许态度；噶伦堡是这次西藏叛乱的指挥中心——我想这是他们使用的字眼。现在据说指挥中心已经移往穆索里——我知道，言语已经失去意义，因为我觉得非常难以对待这些指责”他说，“这是对一个国家的领袖们所作的非常严重的指责。这些指责是由这样一个国家的人民的领袖们这样不负责任地提出的，这个国家的人民我们不仅尊敬和尊重，而且我们认为他们在文化和礼仪以及文明的文雅艺术方面是特别先进的。这使我感到震惊，因为且不管别的一切，我一直尊敬中国人，而且我仍然尊敬他们，因为他们获得了巨大的成就，因为他们有着伟大的文化以及诸如此类的东西。竟然在一时冲动的情况下说出和做出这种事情，这使我感到极为震惊。我希望这种冲动将会过去。”
    尼赫鲁在讲话中叙述他所知道的西藏叛乱事件的经过时强调指出，印度在拉萨的总领事不想干预西藏的局势。他说，“（对这位总领事）我们草拟了电报，这个电报准备好了，可以随时发出，电报说：‘不要牵涉在拉萨过去发生和正在发生的事件里面’。这是在（3月）14日的事。这种情况继续发展下去。就是在那个时候，我想我在人民院发言时曾说过，在拉萨存在意志的冲突。这样说是否正确，我不知道。问题是，在那个时候没有真正的战斗。真正的战斗是在几天以后爆发的。在3月20日开始了战斗。战斗是怎么开始的，我不知道。我们坐在领事馆内的总领事也不知道，人们也不能够期望他知道战斗是在什么时候开始的。正如我们现在所知道的，他当时不知道。在17日晚上，达赖喇嘛和他的随行人员相当秘密地离开了拉萨。据他们说，在17日下午四点钟，两发炮弹或炸弹之类的东西落在夏宫的一个湖里。噢，这使得他们认为‘现在是最后的时刻，现在宫廷要遭到轰击，到处都要爆发战争’，于是他们就离开了拉萨。”
    他又说，“据我所知——我并不肯定——即使在那时，他还没有离开西藏的充分打算。但是，那个打算一定是在后来拉萨遭到炮弹轰击的时候形成的。总之，在从11日到20日或21日这一周内，在这十天左右时间内，这就是我们得到的消息。我们对此什么事也不能做，而且“在（3月）10日或11日以前，除了我们自然知道各种对立的力量在拉萨和西藏活动以外，我们对于局势毫无所知。然后，我们面临了达赖喇嘛可能到这里来的问题，我们决定，我们应当接待他。他来了。本院可能知道，我曾经拒绝过，可是人们一再向我询问：‘你打算对来自西藏的无论多少难民都开放门户吗？’我拒绝那样做，虽然我内心知道，我不能够认真拒绝给予陷于非常困难处境的人们以避难权，我不能这样做；但是我当时不愿意说出这一点，从而招致人们从各地蜂涌跑到印度来。事情的经过和我们的所作所为的简单情况就是如此。现在我们被称为扩张主义分子和帝国主义分子等等种种名目，我认为，这对我们究竟这是怎样的人不会有任何实际影响；然而，由于这些指责出之于我们认为是朋友的那些人之口，确实使我们难过。”
    尼赫鲁说，“现在我想只向你们谈几个事实。北京报纸上又出现了一件异乎寻常的事情。它们现在追述了1950年的事情，那就是追述了我们在中国军队进入西藏的时候发出的一些备忘录。这是一些非常客气的备忘录。对这些备忘录的回答不是很客气的，但是现在的问题是，他们提到这些备忘录，说我们当时写给他们的东西是在同英国政府磋商后写成的，说我们虽然自称是独立的，但实际上我们充当了英国政府的走卒或工具。这当然是完全错误的，不合事实的。根本不存在我们同英国政府磋商的事情。我们对西藏的看法是与英国政府不同的。”
    谈到班禅额尔德尼4月29日在中国人民政协全国委员会会议上的讲话时，尼赫鲁说，“当我读到一位曾是我们的贵宾的人士所发表的一篇如此缺乏气度和尊严的讲话时，我感到相当难过。我并不知道他所说的一些小事，不知道他的人员在某个地方没有得到适当的住处。我无法回答说在阿兰迦巴或某个这样的地方是否发生过某种困难，因为达赖喇嘛和班禅喇嘛的随从人员是如此之多——有数百人。要作我们所希望作的那么多的准备并不那么容易。”
    他说，“现在，就我们而论，我们既没有从噶伦堡，也没有从穆索里或任何其他地方进行干涉。我们运用了我们给予避难权的毫无疑问的权利。我已经说过，达赖喇嘛是完全自由的人，可以在印度随便到哪里去，或者回到西藏去。”他还说，“达赖喇嘛在这里并没有被劫持，他并不是在任何劫持下进入印度的，而只是受到环境的劫持，如果你愿意这样说的话——形势所迫。我在和他会面和谈话后，肯定可以根据我个人所了解的情况说，他耽在印度，甚至耽在穆索里，是出于他自己的自由意志。我愿意恭恭敬敬地说，任何否认这个事实的人是完全不了解事实，是不了解情况而随便讲话的。”
    他说，“此外，议员先生们也许在报纸的标题——因为标题用了一些奇特的说法——中看到我曾经说过，如果达赖喇嘛回到西藏，我会感到高兴。我曾经这样说过。有人曾向我提出问题，我就说，‘如果他体面地回去，我自然会感到高兴’。但是这完全不是说我要把达赖喇嘛推出去，或者是使他处于一种为难的境地。完全要由他来决定怎样做，什么时候做。当我同他在一起的时候，我向他提出的唯一的意见是：你经过了一段非常艰难的旅程和十分令人烦恼的经历。作为一个比你年纪大得多的人，我是否可以建议你休息几天，安安静静地考虑一下发生的事情，然后作你愿意作的事情。”
    尼赫鲁在讲话中再一次谈到他对西藏叛乱事件的看法，他说，“我并不确切知道西藏究竟发生了什么情况。但是，正如我在我以前的声明中所说的，根据中国的说法，这是相当重大的事情，规模非常大的事情。如果既看看西藏过去的历史，也看看周围的环境，那么人们就很可以设想，除了所谓代表既得利益的人——是会有这些人的——以外，事实上，有很多西藏人——我可以说，不管他们是多数还是少数，但是无疑是很多的人——既然采取了他们所采取的这种步骤，这的确意味着是一个非常危险的步骤。无论如何，事情是发生了，人们对此有着强烈的感受。”
    尼赫鲁说，关于“难民”，现在最新的情况是，现在有接近六千五百名左右的“难民”正在经过“东北边境特区”的卡门地区，有一千五百人正在穿过不丹，有七百人已经到达锡金——共约有九千人。不丹政府已经要求我们接受经过他们的领土的西藏“难民”，我们已经同意这样做。这样，我们有着大约九千名
  “难民”，我们已经负起为他们作某种安排的责任。少数难民进入印度时带有武器。他们一进入印度便被解除了武装。他说，这些“难民”中一部分暂时收容在阿萨姆邦米萨马里的营场里，还有一部分将由西孟加拉邦修建营场来收容。他说，外交部已经指定专门的官员去处理难民的问题。
    他说，“我们不会让他们像囚徒一样长久呆在营场里。事实上，我们给边境官员的指示就是要他们告诉难民们：我们并不负责无限期地维持他们的生活。”他说，“自然，当这些人进来的时候，我们在某种程度上是要负责的。我们不能让他们在印度流浪。这里又有一个问题，那就是他们除了在山区较冷的气候条件下以外，是不容易在任何地方长住下去的——我们根本不能把他们送到印度其他地区去。”
