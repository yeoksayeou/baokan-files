　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th—Under the affectionate care of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, the children of North Korea live happily.

　　Currently, all school-age children in North Korea receive free education. North Korea began implementing compulsory junior middle school education on November 1st last year; from April 1st this year, tuition fees have been completely abolished in all schools. North Korea now has more than 4,300 primary schools, three times the number during the Japanese rule, with an average of one junior middle school every 1.7 *li*.

　　Welfare facilities for children have also increased rapidly in recent years. Last year, 834 nurseries were added in cities and industrial and mining areas, all equipped with playrooms and breastfeeding rooms. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions have established more than 12,000 permanent or seasonal nurseries, where children of working mothers in both urban and rural areas can receive good care. With the increase in the number of employed women, North Korea is vigorously increasing the number of nurseries and kindergartens this year. Pyongyang alone will add 97 kindergartens and nurseries this year.

　　Every summer, an average of 150,000 children and students enjoy free summer camp in scenic spots across the country. This summer, 200,000 to 250,000 children will go to summer camps in various places for their summer vacation.

　　In addition, the Republic has built many children's parks, children's palaces, and children's theaters in various places.

　　Czechoslovakia Opens Special Schools for Disabled Children to Receive Education
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 29th—Czechoslovakia today has 374 schools specifically for children who cannot attend regular schools due to certain physical defects. These schools have 19,000 children.

　　The selfless work of well-trained teachers and their great care for children have produced good results. Many disabled children have returned to normal life and are engaged in useful work. Many intellectually disabled children are working well in agriculture and construction. They receive formal training, although their curriculum is tailored to their abilities.

　　With special care, blind and hearing-impaired children can receive secondary education and can study at universities. In addition, Czechoslovakia has a special music school that trains blind music teachers. There are now about 100 blind music teachers in the country.

　　Some children's hospitals and sanatoriums also have affiliated schools. Here, teachers provide individualized education for every child patient who needs long-term treatment or recuperation, so that these children do not fall behind in their studies after they recover. Before liberation, there were only three such schools, but now there are 116.

　　Due to the continuous improvement of the material living standards of the Czechoslovak people and the continuous improvement of social medical conditions, the number of disabled children is decreasing.

　　All School-Age Children in Northern Vietnam Will Be Able to Enroll This Year
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th—According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 29th: The General Education Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Education stated that in the 1959-1960 academic year, all school-age children in northern Vietnam will be enrolled.

　　Currently, nearly one million children in northern Vietnam have entered primary schools and nurseries.

　　In the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, children aged six to twelve have entered primary schools.

　　In addition to primary schools, people-run preschool classes are developing more and more in northern Vietnam. In preschool classes, children receive comprehensive education to become excellent primary school students when they enter primary school.

　　In Hanoi, more than 100 preschool classes have been established, enrolling 4,000 children.

　　Caring for Birth, Caring for Growth
　　Albania Provides Comprehensive Care for Children
　　This newspaper reports that in Albania, the Party and the government's care for children begins even before they are born. Currently, 99 consultation stations have been established across the country to help pregnant women prepare and provide free nutritional supplements. Before liberation, there was only one maternity hospital in the country, but now 74 have been established, and all women can enter maternity hospitals for free delivery.

　　Pediatric departments have been established in medical institutions across the country. According to state regulations, children under the age of four who require long-term medical care can receive free treatment. Infants under one year old are treated directly by general hospitals or mobile medical vehicles.

　　Primary education has been universally implemented throughout the country. Currently, every village has a school. The number of primary school students is now three times higher than in 1938. In 1938, there were only 11 seven-year schools, and they were all concentrated in cities; now there are 420, most of which are distributed in rural areas, and the number of students is ten times higher than in 1938. In order to facilitate the enrollment of children of workers and peasants, the state has established scholarships. Currently, 60.4% of middle school students receive state assistance.

　　In this year's budget, the state plans to allocate 1.42 billion *leks* (Albanian currency) for children's affairs, to subsidize mothers and families with multiple children, to offset losses caused by the low-priced sale of children's goods, to provide funds for Young Pioneer recreational facilities, and to subsidize kindergarten meals, etc.

　　In order to educate children well, schools, parents, youth organizations, women's organizations, and trade unions have carried out a variety of activities. In terms of extracurricular education for children, 15 children's centers have been established across the country, and there is also a Young Pioneer Palace in Tirana that can accommodate 3,000 Young Pioneers every day. There are six Young Pioneer parks across the country. Every summer, with the assistance of enterprises and youth organizations, summer camps are set up domestically, providing a lunch every day and organizing various recreational programs for the children. Young Pioneers can carry out activities here all day long. In addition, more than 9,000 children spend their summer vacation in summer camps in scenic and climatically suitable locations.

　　无限关怀社会主义接班人
    朝鲜北部学龄儿童全部享受免费教育
    新华社平壤30日电　在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的亲切关怀下，朝鲜北部的儿童过着愉快幸福的生活。
    目前，朝鲜北部的学龄儿童全部受着免费教育。朝鲜北部从去年11月1日开始实行了初中义务教育制；今年4月1日开始，各级学校又全面免收学费。朝鲜北部现在有四千三百多所小学，相当于日本统治时期的三倍，平均每一点七个里就有一所初中。
    为儿童们建立的福利设施近年来也有了飞速的增加。去年，在城市和工矿区增设了八百三十四所托儿所，这些托儿所都设有游戏室和哺乳室；各地农业社自办了一万二千多所常设的或季节性的托儿所，母亲参加工作或劳动的城乡儿童在这里可以得到很好的照顾。随着妇女就业人数的增加，今年，朝鲜北部各地还在大力增设托儿所和幼儿园，仅平壤市今年就要增办九十七所幼儿园和托儿所。
    每年夏天平均有十五万儿童、学生免费到国内各地风景区去愉快地度过夏令营的生活，今年夏天将有二十万到二十五万名儿童前往各地夏令营过暑假。
    此外，共和国还在各地建设了许多儿童公园、儿童宫、儿童剧场等。
    捷开办了专门学校让残废儿童受教育
    新华社布拉格29日电　捷克斯洛伐克今天设有三百七十四所专门为由于生理上的某些缺陷而不能上正规学校的儿童而设的学校。这些学校拥有一万九千名儿童。
    受过良好训练的教师们的忘我工作和对于儿童的巨大关怀产生了很好的成果，很多残废儿童恢复了正常的生活，并从事着有用的工作。不少智力上有缺陷的儿童在农业和建筑业方面工作得很好。他们受到正规的训练，尽管他们的课程是按照他们的能力来安排的。
    由于特别的照顾，盲童和听觉有缺陷的儿童可以受到中学教育，而且能够在大学中学习。此外，捷克斯洛伐克还设有特别的音乐学校，专门训练盲人音乐教师，现在全国有大约一百名盲人音乐教师。
    一些儿童医院和疗养院中还设有附属学校。在这里教师们对每一个需要长期治疗或休养的儿童病人，进行着个别的教育，以使这些儿童在病好之后不至于在学习上落后。解放以前只有三所这样的学校，而目前已发展到一百一十六所。
    由于捷克斯洛伐克人民的物质生活水平不断提高，以及社会医疗条件不断改善，残废儿童的数目正在日益减少。
    越南北部学龄儿童今年全部都能入学
    新华社河内30日电　据越南通讯社29日讯：越南教育部普通教育司发表声明说，在1959—1960年学年中，越南北方所有的学龄儿童都将入学。
    目前，越南北方差不多有一百万儿童入了小学和托儿所。
    在越北自治区，六岁到十二岁的儿童都进了小学。
    除了小学以外，人民自办的幼儿班在越南北方发展得越来越多。在幼儿班中，儿童受到全面的教育，以便使儿童们在进入小学时成为优秀的小学生。
    在河内，吸收了四千名儿童的一百多个幼儿班已经建立起来。
    关怀出生　关怀成长
    阿尔巴尼亚全面照顾儿童
    本报讯　在阿尔巴尼亚，党和政府对于儿童的关怀从他们出生以前就开始了。现在，全国各地建立了九十九处咨询站，帮助孕妇进行准备工作，并免费供给营养品。解放前，全国只有一所产院，现在已建立了七十四所，所有的妇女都可以免费进入产院生产。
    全国各地的医疗机构都设立了小儿科。按照国家规定，需要长期医药照顾的四岁以下的儿童都可以免费治疗。一周岁以下的婴儿，直接由综合医院或巡回病车治疗。
    初等普及教育已在全国普遍实行。目前每一个农村都有了学校。现在小学学生的人数比1938年增加了三倍。在1938年，七年制学校只有十一所，而且都集中在城市里面；现在已有四百二十所，大部分分布在农村，学生人数比1938年增加了十倍。为了便于工农子弟入学，国家设立了助学金。目前，60.4％的中学生得到国家的帮助。
    在今年的预算中，国家准备将十四亿二千万列克（阿币）拨作儿童事业的经费，用于补助多子女的母亲和家庭，平衡因低价出售儿童商品而产生的亏损，供给少先队休养机构的经费和补助幼儿园的伙食等等。
    为了把孩子教育好，学校、家长、青年组织、妇女组织和工会等进行了多种多样的工作。在儿童校外教育方面，全国已建立十五所少年之家，在地拉那还有一所每天可容三千少先队员活动的少先宫。全国共有六个少先公园，每到夏天，在企业和青年组织的协助下，国内设立起夏令营，每天供应一顿午饭，并为孩子们组织各种文娱节目，少先队员们可以整天在这里进行活动。另有九千多个儿童在风景优美、气候适宜的各地的夏令营内度过暑假。（附图片）
