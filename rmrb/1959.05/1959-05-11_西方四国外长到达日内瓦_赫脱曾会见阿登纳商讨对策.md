Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 10th: The foreign ministers of the United States, Herter; Britain, Lloyd; France, Couve de Murville; and West Germany, Brentano, have successively arrived in Geneva yesterday and today in preparation for the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference scheduled to open tomorrow.

    Lloyd, after arriving by plane at noon today, said at the airport that, in our view, the purpose of this (Foreign Ministers) Conference is threefold: "First, to see if agreement can be reached on certain points; second, to try to narrow the differences between the two sides; and third, to prepare some constructive proposals that can be submitted to the summit conference."

    French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville also made a statement when he arrived in Geneva last night. In his statement, he attacked the Soviet Union for "provoking" the current "very serious international crisis." On the one hand, he said that it is necessary to "spare no effort to seek a positive result in the negotiations," but on the other hand, he clamored that "the worst thing would be to make some concessions that are likely to cause a new crisis."

    U.S. Secretary of State Herter also arrived in Geneva on the 9th. On the way, he stopped in Bonn for several hours and held talks with West German Chancellor Adenauer. According to U.S. Ambassador to West Germany, Bruce, who was present at the talks, Herter and Adenauer "agreed" on their views on international issues and reached a "genuine agreement" on the proposals and strategies that the Western countries will put forward at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference. According to a U.S. spokesman, Adenauer's views have not changed.

    西方四国外长到达日内瓦
    赫脱曾会见阿登纳商讨对策
    新华社日内瓦10日电　美国国务卿赫脱、英国外交大臣劳埃德、法国外交部长德姆维尔和西德外交部长勃伦塔诺已经先后在昨天和今天到达日内瓦，准备参加即将于明天开幕的东西方外长会议。
    劳埃德今天中午乘飞机到达后在机场发表谈话说，在我们看来，这次（外长）会议的目的有三：“首先是看看是否能够在某些点上达成协议；其次是试着去缩小双方的分歧；第三是准备好某些能够提交给政府首脑会议的建设性建议”。
    法国外交部长德姆维尔在昨天晚上到达日内瓦时也发表了谈话。他在谈话中攻击苏联“挑起”了目前“非常严重的国际危机”。他一方面表示，必须“不遗余力地求得在谈判中获得一个积极的结果”，但是另一方面他又叫嚷什么“最坏的莫过于作出某种很可能引起新危机的让步”。
    美国国务卿赫脱也在9日到达日内瓦。他在途中曾经在波恩停留了数小时，同西德总理阿登纳进行了会谈。据会谈时在场的美国驻西德大使布鲁斯说，赫脱同阿登纳在对国际问题的看法上“意见一致”，并且对西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上将要提出的建议和使用的策略达成了“真正的协议”。而据一个美国发言人说，阿登纳的意见是没有什么改变的。
