Proceeding from the Worst-Case Scenario, Striving for the Best Possible Outcome
Jiangxi's Flood Control Army Bravely Repairs Dikes in the Rain

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 21st) Jiangxi's million-strong flood control army, "proceeding from the worst-case scenario and striving for the best possible outcome," is bravely repairing key dikes in the rain.

Continuous rain has persisted in Jiangxi for nearly twenty days. The water levels of the five major rivers—Gan, Fu, Xin, Rao, and Xiu—and Poyang Lake, as well as various internal rivers, have risen sharply. The Fu and Xin rivers have exceeded warning levels.

To prevent flooding, Jiangxi province has formed an 800,000-strong flood control and rescue commando team and a 120,000-strong permanent infrastructure team, which are inspecting dams and dikes day and night in the rain.

Jiangxi province has already collected millions of grass sacks and a large quantity of wood and bamboo reinforcing bars and has begun to transport them to various dangerous sections. To solve the problem of insufficient flood control materials, many areas are using substitutes extensively, such as reeds and tree branches instead of anti-erosion and anti-wave wooden piles, and dried thatch bamboo instead of torches and oil lamps. Effective methods such as mutual support, exchange at equal value, and local sourcing have been used to prioritize the needs for flood control materials. Mountainous counties such as Nancheng in Fuzhou Prefecture, following the principle of "exchange at equal value," are giving priority to supplying a large amount of timber and moso bamboo to the riverside and lakeside areas, to meet the urgent need for rescue. Departments such as posts and telecommunications, land reclamation, commerce, and transportation throughout the region have established close ties with flood control based on their own operations.

The more than 560,000 large and small flood control and irrigation projects completed in Jiangxi in recent years are favorable conditions for overcoming this year's floods. These projects can store a total of 20 billion cubic meters of water (2.5 billion cubic meters more than half the storage capacity of Poyang Lake). Under normal circumstances, with a relatively even distribution of rainfall, they can intercept 250 millimeters of surface runoff from a single rainfall. To ensure that these projects can fully play their role during the flood season, their capacity has been emptied, and a comprehensive inspection of key projects such as dams and spillways has been carried out to ensure safe water discharge. Some earth dams that are not high enough have been raised and had auxiliary dams added. Detailed inspections have also been carried out on soil dam seepage and deep cracks, and various effective defense measures have been taken.

Many places have also adopted methods such as raising field ridges and diverting water for storage in the fields to reduce surface runoff and the burden on rivers. The 800,000 mu of field ridges in Fuzhou Prefecture have now been raised, which can intercept one-half of the 500 millimeters of surface runoff from a single rainfall, greatly reducing the burden of water accumulation in rivers.

To protect low-lying, flood-prone areas from flooding, the excavation of 2,540 ditches has recently been completed, allowing accumulated water to be quickly drained through the ditches.

Storing water upstream and discharging water downstream, combining storage and discharge, and comprehensive cooperation and coordinated operations are the fundamental measures for maximizing flood control. To this end, Jiangxi has widely educated the masses, ensuring that when floods arrive, upstream and downstream, left and right banks, can act in the spirit of communist cooperation, so that the upstream can store as much as possible and the downstream can discharge as much as possible, achieving a combination of storage and discharge.

    从最坏情况出发　向最好方向努力
    江西防汛大军冒雨抢修堤坝
    本报南昌21日电　江西百万防汛大军“从最坏情况出发，向最好方向努力”，冒雨抢修险要堤段。
    江西全境持续阴雨已近二十天。赣、抚、信、饶、修五大江河和鄱阳湖，以及各内河水位骤涨，抚水、信江并超过警戒水位。
    为防止洪水出险，江西全省已组成八十万人防汛抢险突击队和十二万人的常年基建队，正冒雨日夜检修坝、堤。
    江西全省目前已筹集了数以百万计的草袋和大批木头、竹筋，并开始向各险段调运。为解决防汛器材不足的问题，许多地区大量采用代用品，如芦苇、树枝代替防冲防浪木桩，以干茅竹代替火把和油灯。并以彼此支援，等价交换，就地取材等有效办法，优先满足了防汛器材的需要。抚州专区南城等山区县份按照了“等价交换”的原则，将大批木料、毛竹等防汛器材优先供应沿江、滨湖地区，以济抢险急需。全区邮电、农垦、商业、交通等部门，都结合本身业务与防汛方面取得了密切联系。
    江西几年来所完成的五十六万多座大小型防洪和灌溉工程，是战胜今年洪水的有利条件。这些工程共可蓄水二百亿公方（比半个鄱阳湖的蓄水量还多二十五亿公方），在一般雨水分布较为均匀的情况下，可以拦蓄一次降雨二百五十公厘的地面径流量。为使这些工程能在防汛期中充分发挥作用，现已腾空肚腹，并对大坝、溢洪道等关键性工程进行了全面检查，以便安全泄水，一些不够高度的土坝，已加高和增修子坝。对于土坝渗漏、深隙情况，也都作了详细检查，作出多种有效防御措施。
    许多地方还采取了加高田埂，引用田间蓄水的办法，减少地面径流和河水负担。抚州专区八十万亩田埂，现都已加高，可以拦蓄地面一次降雨五百公厘径流量二分之一，大大减轻了河流积水负担。
    为使低洼易涝地区免除涝灾，最近还完成了二千五百四十条沟渠的开挖，积水可以迅速通过河沟排除。
    各河上蓄下泄、蓄泄兼施和全面配合、协同作战是最大限度控制洪水的根本措施。为此，江西各地已普遍对群众进行了宣传教育，保证洪水到来时，上下游左右岸能本着共产主义协作精神，使上游尽量蓄，下游尽量排，做到蓄泄兼施。
