    (Reported by our newspaper) On the Xiamen, Da Deng, and Xiao Deng frontline islands in Fujian, separated by a narrow strip of water from Jinmen Island, the spring-sown crops are growing lush and green in the fields, which were once riddled with shell craters but have now been leveled. Peanuts and soybeans have generally branched, flowered, and formed pods, and the early rice is already one to two feet tall. Currently, while continuing to do a good job of supporting the front and standing guard, the broad masses of commune members are stepping up their efforts to accumulate fertilizer and carry out field management tasks such as mid-cultivation weeding and pest and disease control. The People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers stationed on the islands are also making great efforts to support mass production during breaks from combat and combat readiness. Thanks to the joint efforts of the army and the people, all crops on the islands have now been cultivated and top-dressed once or twice, and a large amount of farm manure and sea fertilizer has been accumulated in the past twenty days, with an average of fifteen dan of fertilizer applied per mu of crops.
    The islands of Xiamen, Da Deng, and Xiao Deng are only five or six to more than ten *li* away from Da Jinmen and Xiao Jinmen, which are occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. During the artillery bombardment of Jinmen last year, the members of the Frontline Communes and War Zone Army-Civilian Communes on these islands actively supported the front while persisting in production, achieving a double harvest in support of the front and production, and were praised as communes that "are heroes in supporting the front and models in production." After the start of spring plowing and planting this year, the broad masses of commune members have once again enthusiastically launched a production competition movement to seize a large-scale bumper summer harvest with a fighting spirit. They use the shell craters made by enemy shells to repair water reservoirs and manure pits, accumulating a large amount of rainwater and compost for irrigation and fertilization, and leveling the fields and wasteland overturned by Chiang Kai-shek's shells to expand the planting area of grain and cash crops. This year, not only have these islands planted various crops faster and better than last year, but also because this year's rainfall is abundant and the island's water conservancy conditions have been further improved, the planting area of crops such as rice and vegetables has been expanded by about 10% compared with the original plan. He厝 Village, which stands on the forefront of Xiamen Island, has a total planting area of more than 1,300 *mu* of rice, vegetables, and sorghum, which is an expansion of 394 *mu* compared with the original planting plan.

    福建前线岛屿作物生长得一片葱绿
    前线公社和战地军民公社社员大搞生产竞赛
    本报讯　福建前线和金门岛一水之隔的厦门和大、小嶝等前哨岛屿，在原来那些弹坑累累经过平整的田野里，春种春播作物生长得一片葱绿。花生、大豆都已普遍分枝和开花结荚，早稻也有一、二尺高了。目前广大社员在继续作好支援前线、站岗放哨的同时，加紧赶积肥料和中耕除草、防治病虫害等田间管理工作。驻守岛屿的人民解放军官兵们也利用战斗和战备间隙，大力支援群众生产。在军民的共同努力下，目前岛上所有作物都已中耕追肥一遍到二遍，并在最近二十天中积了大量农家肥和海肥，平均每亩作物可增施肥料十五担。
    厦门和大、小嶝等岛屿和蒋军盘踞的大、小金门相距仅五、六华里到十多华里。在去年炮击金门战斗中，这些岛屿上的前线公社和战地军民公社的社员们，曾一面积极支前，一面坚持生产，获得了支前生产两丰收，被誉为“支前是英雄，生产称模范”的公社。今年春耕春种开始后，广大社员又以战斗的姿态热烈开展了夺取夏季大面积丰收的丰产竞赛运动。他们把敌人炮弹打成的弹坑用来修为水堀和粪坑，积贮大量雨水和沤肥用来灌溉和肥田，耙平了被蒋军炮弹打翻的田地和荒地，用来扩大粮食和经济作物种植面积。这些岛屿今年不但各种作物种得比去年又快又好，同时因为今年雨水充沛和岛上水利条件有了进一步改善，水稻、蔬菜等作物种植面积，比原订计划扩大了10％左右。屹立在厦门岛上最前沿的何厝村，水稻、蔬菜和高粱等种植面积共达一千三百多亩，比原订种植计划扩大了三百九十四亩。
