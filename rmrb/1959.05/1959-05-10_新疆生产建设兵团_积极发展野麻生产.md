Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps

Actively Develops Wild Hemp Production

(Our report) The Agricultural First Division and Agricultural Second Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have newly established more than ten farms in the upper and lower reaches of the Tarim River, all of which attach great importance to wild hemp production this year.

Wild hemp, also known as Luobuma, is a wild, high-grade fiber plant. After processing its bark, it can be woven into beautiful, soft, and strong fabrics such as valitin and worsted. Because of its long fiber and strong tensile strength, it can also be used to weave fishing nets and make high-grade ropes. The leaves of wild hemp contain 4% to 5% of colloids, which, if extracted, can also be used to make automobile tires.

In addition to establishing a wild hemp farm in the area where wild hemp grows most densely in the upper reaches of the Tarim River, the Agricultural First Division has also made wild hemp production one of the main sideline projects this year for other farms. When the Agricultural Second Division established farms in Yuli to Tieganli in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, each farm planned to reserve 2,000 to 5,000 mu of wild hemp land during land reclamation as a base for annual wild hemp production in the future. Now, many farms in the upper reaches of the Tarim River have purchased various hemp peeling machines, and some farms have also planned to build wild hemp degumming plants, preparing to process the peeled wild hemp bark locally.

Now is the season for cutting hemp. Most of the farms and wild hemp farms in the upper and lower reaches of the Tarim River have organized special personnel to harvest wild hemp. The wild hemp farm of the Agricultural First Division has currently harvested more than 1.6 million jin of wild hemp stalks, which can yield more than 320,000 jin of wild hemp bark after processing. On the highway line from Yuli to Tieganli in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, groups of soldiers can be seen everywhere harvesting wild hemp. On the highways near some farms, wild hemp stalks are laid out as far as the eye can see. This is a method used by the soldiers to save manpower, allowing passing cars to replace hemp peeling machines. The nine newly established farms of the Agricultural Second Division in the lower reaches of the Tarim River plan to produce 3.5 million to 4 million jin of pure wild hemp for the state this year. In this way, by the end of this year, about 5 million jin of pure wild hemp will be shipped out of the Tarim area to support the textile industry in the interior and various places in Xinjiang.

On both banks of the Tarim River, wild hemp grows everywhere, and in some places, it spreads for hundreds of kilometers. In order to make full use of these wild, high-grade fiber plants, the various farms newly established by the Agricultural First Division and Agricultural Second Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in the Tarim area, in addition to managing and removing weeds in areas where large areas of wild hemp grow, have also begun to collect wild hemp seeds, preparing to cultivate them artificially on land where crops are not easy to grow.

### 新疆生产建设兵团  积极发展野麻生产

    新疆生产建设兵团
    积极发展野麻生产
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团农业第一师和农业第二师在塔里木河上下游新建立的十多个农场，今年都非常重视野麻生产。
    野麻又名罗布麻，是一种野生高级纤维植物。它的皮经过加工处理后，可以织成漂亮、柔软、坚实的凡立丁、华达呢，由于它的纤维长、拉力强，还可织鱼网和制作高级绳索，野麻叶片中含的4％到5％的胶质，如果能够提炼出来，还可以制作汽车的轮胎。
    农一师除在塔里木河最上游野麻生长较集中的地方建立了一个野麻农场外，其他各农场也都把野麻生产作为今年副业的主要项目之一。农二师在塔里木河下游尉犁至铁干里建立农场时，各场在开荒造田过程中，有计划地留出了两千亩到五千亩野麻地，作为今后每年生产野麻的基地。现在，塔里木河上游的很多农场，都购置了各种剥麻机，有的农场还筹建了野麻脱胶厂，准备把剥出来的野麻皮就地加工。
    现在，正是割麻的季节，塔里木河上下游各农场和野麻农场，大部分都组织了专人收割野麻。农一师的野麻农场，目前已割回野麻杆一百六十多万斤，经过处理后，可获野麻皮三十二万多斤。在塔里木下游尉犁到铁干里的公路线上，到处都可以看到三五成群的战士在割野麻。有些农场附近的公路上，铺满了一眼望不到头的野麻杆，这是战士们为了节省人力，让来往的汽车代替剥麻机进行工作的一种方法。农二师在塔里木河下游新建立的九个农场，计划今年给国家生产出纯野麻三百五十万至四百万斤。这样，在今年年底以前，将有五百万斤左右的纯野麻从塔里木地区运出，支援内地的纺织工业和新疆各地的需要。
    塔里木河上下游两岸，到处野麻丛生，有些地方竟蔓延数百公里，为了充分利用这些野生高级纤维植物，新疆生产建设兵团农一师和农二师在塔里木地区新建立的各个农场，除对大片生长野麻的地方进行管理和铲除杂草外，还开始收集野麻种籽，准备在农作物不易生长的土地上进行人工培植。
