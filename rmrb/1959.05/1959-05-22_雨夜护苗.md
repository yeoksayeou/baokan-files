    Protecting Seedlings on a Rainy Night
　　Tan Shi
    It was a deep night, with strong wind and heavy rain. The wind howled through the trees; raindrops, like beans, pounded on the tiled roofs, making a continuous rattling sound. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew in through the crack in the window, and with a "crash," the two unlatched window panels were pushed open, waking Old Ding from his sweet sleep. He sat up from the warm quilt, blinked his old eyes, and looked at the sky through the window. The sky was dark and gloomy, and nothing could be seen clearly. A gust of cold wind blew in, making Old Ding shiver. He suddenly thought of the several mu of early rice seeds he had sown a few days ago, which were sprouting leaves, and unfortunately, they had encountered such bad weather...
    "No, we must find a way to protect the seedlings immediately. If the seedlings rot, it will delay the major affairs."
    He was about to wake up his son, who was sleeping in the next room, when he suddenly heard someone gently knocking on the window of the next room. At first, he thought it was the sound of the wind, but upon listening carefully, he heard someone talking softly.
    "Changjing, Changjing, are you up?"
    "Hmm, coming! What's the matter?"
    "Listen, it's raining so hard and the wind is so strong, a cold wave is here! The commune Party committee just issued a notice to immediately mobilize to protect the seedlings." After a pause, that person continued, "Did you hear? We must immediately cover the rice paddies with a layer of fire-soil ash. Hurry to the shed behind the canteen to move the fire-soil ash." "Okay, I'll go right away!"
    Changjing's voice suddenly rose, but was immediately stopped by the other person: "Keep it down, it's the middle of the night, don't wake your father. If the old man knows it's about protecting seedlings, he will want to go too."
    The sound of the conversation gradually lowered. Then, the door of the next room opened with a "creak" and closed again with a "creak." Obviously, his son had left. The one who called Changjing was, judging by the voice, the production team leader Xiang Mingsheng.
    Hearing that he was not allowed to go to protect the seedlings, Old Ding was very annoyed. He immediately put on his clothes, got out of bed, felt for the carrying basket in the corner of the room, put it on his back, and put on his straw hat, and walked out the door. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, a gust of wind blew, turning his straw hat over. Fortunately, his hands were quick enough to prevent the hat from being blown away.
    Old Ding calmed himself down and looked around: the sky was dark, and the opposite mountain was like a huge black barrier in front of him. The narrow path leading to the fields could not be seen at all. The rain continued to fall, and seemed to be getting heavier and heavier. Which way did the team members go? He couldn't see, but he could hear faint voices coming from the distant rice paddies. Just as he was groping forward, he suddenly thought of this: with such a strong wind, if windbreaks were not set up at the edge of the field, the fire-soil ash would surely be blown away. Thinking of this, he immediately turned around and walked towards the storage room. The team's large mats could now be used temporarily. At this time, he began to grumble: "Hmph, see, you young people, you didn't even think of this."
    The commune members carried baskets of fire-soil ash to the rice paddies. Just as everyone was going into the fields to spread the ash, a gust of strong wind blew up. The production team leader suddenly thought of the problem of setting up windbreaks:
    "Wait, everyone, it won't work without windbreaks, the fire-soil ash will be gone with the wind. Quick, let's go separately to carry mats and wood."
    "Team leader! Send someone to move the wood! I brought the mats." As soon as the team leader finished speaking, this loud voice came from the road not far away. People vaguely saw a figure carrying a bundle of long things, slowly getting closer and closer, and they recognized that it was Old Ding.

    雨夜护苗
　　谭实
    深夜，大风大雨。风，吹得树木呼呼作响；雨点儿，像豆子一样，打在瓦屋顶上，西里哗啦直响。忽然，一阵大风从窗缝里吹进来，“哗啦”一声，把没有上好闩的两扇窗子推开了，惊醒了甜睡着的丁老汉。他从暖烘烘的被窝里坐起来，眨巴了两下老花眼，透过窗子，瞧了瞧天。天，是黑沉沉的，什么也看不清楚。一阵冷风吹来，使丁老汉打了一个寒噤。他忽然想到早几天才播下的几亩早稻种，正在发叶，不巧就碰上了这样的坏天气……。
    “不行，得马上想办法，保护秧苗。烂了秧，就误了大事。”
    他正要去叫醒睡在隔壁房子里的儿子，忽然听到有人在轻轻地敲打着隔壁房间的窗子。原先，他还以为是风吹的响声呢，但是，仔细一听，却有人轻轻在谈话。
    “昌敬，昌敬，起来了吧？”
    “嗯，来了！什么事？”
    “你听，下这么大的雨，又刮这么大的风，寒潮来了呀！刚才公社党委发出通知，要马上动员护秧。”停了停，那人又说起来了，“听到吗？我们要马上把秧田普遍盖上一层火土灰。你快到食堂后面的棚子里去搬火土灰去。”“好，我马上就去！”
    昌敬的声音突然提高了，但马上被对方制止住：“轻点，深更半夜的，可别把你父亲吵醒了。老汉知道是护秧，他也会要去的。”
    谈话的声音渐渐低下去。接着，隔壁房间的门“呀”的一声打开，又“呀”的一声，关上了。很显然，儿子已经走了。来叫昌敬的，听声音就知道是生产队长向明生。
    听说不让他去护秧，丁老汉心里可恼火了。他马上穿起衣服，爬下床来，在屋角里摸到背篓往背上一套，又拿起斗笠往头上一戴，打开门儿，就往外走。他刚一跨出门槛，一阵大风吹来，把他的斗笠吹翻了，幸喜得两手来得快，没有把斗笠吹跑。
    丁老汉定了定神，又向四面看了看：天空是黑沉沉的，对面的大山，宛如一方巨大的黑屏障，挡在前面。伸向田野的羊肠小道，这时一线也看不到了。雨，继续不停地下着，而且似乎越下越大了。队上的人从哪条路走了？他看不见，只听到从远处秧田里传来的隐约可以听到的讲话声。正当他摸索着向前走去的时候，忽然想起这桩事来：这样大的风，如果不在田边搭好挡风棚，撒火土灰准会被风吹走。……想到这里，他马上转过身来，向保管室走去。队上的几张大垫子，现在可以拿来暂时用一用了。这时，他又唠叨起来了：“哼，看你们这些年青人，这件事你们就没想到吧。”
    社员们背着一篓篓的火土灰来到秧田了。正当大家下田撒灰的时候，刮起了一阵暴风。生产队长忽然想起了搭风棚的问题：
    “喂，大家等一等，不搭挡风棚可不行呀，风一吹，火土灰就完了。快，我们分头去背垫子和木料。”
    “队长！快派人去搬木料吧！垫子我带来了。”队长的话刚一落音，从不远的路上传来了这宏亮的声音。人们隐隐约约的看到一个背着一捆长长的东西的人影，慢慢地越来越近了，他们看出那正是丁老汉。
