Xinhua News Agency war correspondent Yu Fengyuan

In May, this reporter accompanied a People's Liberation Army (PLA) unit pacifying the rebellion, crossed the Yarlung Tsangpo River, bypassed Yamdrok Lake, traversed the U-yu mountain pass at an altitude of 5,800 meters, and went straight to Doilungdeqen near the border. The tragic scenes of each Dzong and valley along the way after being looted by the rebel bandits were vivid in my mind. While the Shannan Tibetan compatriots were, with the help of the PLA pacification forces, rushing to carry out summer farming and sowing, they tearfully denounced the towering crimes of the rebel bandits in burning, killing, raping, and plundering, and demanded that our army thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits to avenge them.

At noon on May 7, as soon as the pacification troops arrived at Baidi Dzong on the shore of Yamdrok Lake, local Tibetans Renze Suoduo, Zexi Duoji, Gabaduncuo and others bitterly denounced the crimes of the rebel bandits to the commanders and fighters. There were forty-four households in Baidi Dzong. Not long ago, more than thirty rebel bandits sneaked into this village, turning it into a ghostly place where passersby were robbed. From then on, the food and property carried by travelers were looted as soon as they arrived here. Two Tibetans were beaten to death on the spot with horse whips for resisting the bandits' robbery, and one was tied up and taken away, and his life and death are still unknown. At the same time, the rebel bandits also searched every household in Baidi Dzong, looting the residents' property and mules and horses, raping local women and nuns of Gsangkyim Choling Monastery, and forced all the residents of the village to send their only food, butter, etc. to the warehouse set up by the rebel bandits in front of Gsangkyim Choling Monastery. Any slight delay was met with severe beatings. Renze Suoduo, who was beaten by the rebel bandits, cried and said: "The rebel bandits robbed my family of highland barley and three mules, and then used guns to force me to send the tsampa and butter from my home. The rebel bandits didn't like the food, so they tied me and my father to the pillars in the stable and beat us severely, without giving us food or drink for a day." Zexi Duoji was captured to guard the things robbed by the rebel bandits. He refused to do such a thing, so he secretly escaped home. The rebel bandits caught him, beat him with the back of a knife, tied him up and threw him in the stable, and robbed him of a mule. The rebel bandits stayed here for two and a half months. Nine out of ten households in the village were looted, with no food left overnight and no clothes to keep out the cold. Many Tibetans were forced to flee into the mountains with the old and the young, enduring the wind and frost in the barren mountains where no grass or trees grew. After the little tsampa they carried was eaten, many people lived by catching birds and animals and digging wild grass. The sound of crying from hunger and cold was constantly heard in the mountains and fields. After the liberation of Baidi Dzong, the Tibetans who returned from the mountains were all skin and bones. Our army immediately distributed nearly 3,000 jin of grain to forty extremely poor Tibetan households, rescuing them from the brink of starvation.

The deeper we went into the hinterland of the Shannan area, the more outrageous the towering crimes of the rebel bandits became. Wherever our army went, Tibetan men and women, lamas and nuns, all poured out their irreconcilable hatred for the rebel bandits. The rebel bandits who disturbed Ruding Monastery robbed the temple of all its gold and silver, valuables, Buddha statues, sacrificial vessels, etc. The old lama guarding the temple was beaten half to death. The rebel bandits also committed sodomy on five young lamas in the temple. Some nuns in the temples could not bear the insults of the rebel bandits and fled to the mountains to hide.

On the third day after our army arrived in Doilungdeqen, we received a complaint letter written collectively by eleven households in Longru (village) near the border, represented by Tibetan compatriots Dazha Yi'a, Kenxia, and Yixi G登. The letter said that several remnants of the rebel bandits who were defeated by the People's Liberation Army, when passing through Longru to flee abroad, robbed one group after another, and all the livestock, food and clothing of the entire village were robbed by the rebel bandits.

A Tibetan youth named Baima Duoji from Lingxi near Daglung Dzong, who had studied at the Central University for Nationalities, was captured by the rebel bandits, tied up and tortured, and his legs and arms were injured. In Lalung, Doilungdeqen, Tibetan compatriot Zongzhou Xuesha had worked in the Doilungdeqen Dzong Office. In February this year, ten rebel bandits broke into his home, stripped him naked and hung him on the beam, whipping him until his skin was torn and bleeding, and raped his wife in front of him. Tibetan compatriots Jinmei Nianza and Wangza from Zemo, Doilungdeqen were captured by the rebel bandits and detained in the bandit den for several days, forcing each of them to hand over a gun and thirty bullets to the rebel bandits. If they could not hand them over, they would be shot. Wangza could not get a gun, and the rebel bandits tortured him severely and robbed all the things in his home.

The Shannan Tibetan women suffered the tragic insults of the depraved rebel bandits. As soon as our army arrived in Daglung Dzong, a Tibetan woman who did not want to reveal her name sobbed: The rebel bandits robbed all her things, raped her, and then gang-raped her teenage daughter in front of her. When a group of rebel bandits gang-raped the

    山南藏胞的血海深仇
    新华社随军记者　于逢源
    5月间，记者随同人民解放军一支平叛部队，渡过雅鲁藏布江，绕过羊卓雍湖，翻越海拔五千八百公尺的乌玉山口，直抵国境附近的多宗。沿途各宗、溪被叛匪洗劫后的凄惨景象，历历在目。山南藏胞一面在人民解放军平叛部队帮助下，突击进行夏耕播种，一面含着眼泪向指战员们控诉叛匪烧杀淫掠的滔天罪行，要求我军彻底肃清残余叛匪，为他们报仇雪恨。
    5月7日中午，平叛部队刚到达羊卓雍湖畔的白地宗，当地藏胞仁泽索多、泽西多吉、噶巴顿措等人便向部队指战员悲愤地控诉了叛匪的罪行。白地宗共有四十四户人家，不久前，三十多个叛匪窜进这个村庄，把这个村变成拦路打劫的鬼门关。从此，来往客旅行人所携带的粮食、财物，一到这里就被搜劫一空。有两个藏胞因为抗拒叛匪拦劫，一个当场被用马鞭活活打死，一个被捆绑而去，至今生死不明。与此同时，叛匪在白地宗还挨家逐户地翻箱倒柜，抢劫了居民的财物和骡马，奸淫了当地妇女和格桑曲林寺的尼姑，又强迫全村居民把仅有的粮食、酥油等送到叛匪设在格桑曲林寺前的仓库里，稍有怠慢，就遭到毒打。被叛匪打伤的仁泽索多哭诉说：“叛匪抢走了我家的青稞和三头骡子，又用枪押着我把家里的糌粑、酥油送去，叛匪嫌东西不好，便把我和我的父亲反绑在马棚里的柱子上痛打了一顿，一天没有给吃喝。”泽西多吉被捉去看管叛匪抢劫的东西，他不肯干这样的事情，便偷偷逃回家，叛匪把他捉回来后，用刀背乱打一顿，又反绑起来丢在马厩里，并抢走了他的一头骡子。叛匪在这里住了两个半月，全村被抢的十室九空，家无隔宿粮，身无御寒衣。许多藏胞被迫扶老携幼，弃家逃入深山，在光秃秃的草木不生的荒山里，备受风吹霜打之苦，携带的一点糌粑吃完了，许多人便靠捕捉鸟兽，挖掘野草为生，山野里不时传出啼饥号寒的悲泣声。白地宗解放后，从深山里回来的藏胞，个个骨瘦如柴。我军当即给四十户极端贫困的藏胞分发了将近三千斤粮食，从饥饿线上解救了他们。
    愈深入到山南地区腹地，叛匪的滔天罪行愈令人发指。我军所到之处，男女藏胞和喇嘛、尼姑，都纷纷倾诉他们和叛匪的不共戴天之仇。窜扰如武德经寺的叛匪，把寺内的金银财物、贵重佛像、祭器等抢劫一空，守寺的老喇嘛被吊打得半死半活，叛匪并鸡奸了寺里的五个小喇嘛。有些寺庙的尼姑不堪叛匪的凌辱，纷纷逃往深山藏匿。
    我军到达多宗的第三天，接到靠近国境的龙如（村）藏胞达扎伊阿、肯霞、益西格登代表全村十一户集体写的一份控诉书，书中说，被人民解放军击溃的几股残余叛匪，在经过龙如逃往外国时，过一伙、抢一遍，全村的牲口、粮食和衣物全部被叛匪抢光。
    打隆宗附近岭溪一个曾在中央民族学院学习的藏族青年白玛多吉，被叛匪捉去，捆绑拷打，他的腿和胳膊都被打伤。在多宗的拉隆地方，藏胞宗周雪厦曾在多宗宗办事处工作过，今年2月间，十个叛匪冲进他的家里，把他剥光衣服吊在梁上，鞭打得皮破血流，并且当着他的面，轮奸了他的妻子。多宗泽墨地方的藏胞金美年扎、旺扎等人被叛匪捉到匪巢捆绑扣押了好几天，强迫他们每人交给叛匪一支枪、三十发子弹，交不出，就要枪毙他们。旺扎弄不到枪，叛匪把他严刑拷打后，又把他家里的东西全部抢光。
    山南藏族妇女遭到丧尽人心的叛匪惨痛的凌辱。我军一到打隆宗，一位不愿公布名字的藏族妇女就泣诉道：叛匪抢光了她的东西，强奸了她以后，又当着她的面轮奸了她十几岁的女儿。一群叛匪在轮奸藏族妇女贵莎旺姆时，她挣扎不从，叛匪就残酷地扭坏了她的一条腿，强行轮奸。多宗二十岁的藏族姑娘白玛被叛匪强拉到兑如林寺奸污了一个月，直到平叛大军逼近多宗时才解救了她。
    叛匪在山南地区的滔天罪行是罄竹难书的。一位名叫索纳多吉的藏胞在向我军控诉叛匪的罪行时说：“叛匪像一群魔鬼，到了那里，那里就遭殃。连小孩一听说叛匪来了，都吓得直哭。”
    解放了的山南藏胞，正在揩干眼泪，发出“今生恨，今生消，血海深仇定要报”的誓言，奋起支援人民解放军彻底肃清残余叛匪，并且在人民解放军的帮助下重建家园。
