    Fang Wenhua is a twelve-year-old boy, a fourth-grade student at Xidajie Elementary School in Wuchang District, Wuhan.

    A year ago, Fang Wenhua didn't study hard, and he also liked to swear, fight, and disrupt classroom order. His conduct grades were D and C every semester. His father asked him, "Why do others get A, but you get D?" He would say, "They are cowards." The homeroom teacher, Wang Ehua, talked to him more than once, but he either argued with the teacher or sulked in silence. Teacher Wang, exasperated, said to him, "From today onwards, you are not to swear or fight anymore; if you continue to make mistakes, I will truly expel you." However, Fang Wenhua would behave for, at most, two days before causing trouble again. Wherever there was a fight, he was sure to be there. Finally, Fang Wenhua committed a serious offense. One day, after class, Fang Wenhua was playing with his stamp collection. His classmate, Liu Guanghui, saw that he had many stamps and jokingly said, "The stamps are stolen, right?" This sentence angered Fang Wenhua, and he suddenly stood up and punched Liu Guanghui so hard that blood streamed from his nose, and he lay on the ground unable to move. The principal and the students' parents came, and the injured classmate was sent to the hospital.

    Teacher Wang was so angry about this incident that she trembled all over. What should she do with Fang Wenhua in the future? She examined her own educational methods towards Fang Wenhua and, recalling that the school had repeatedly called on teachers to strengthen communist education for children and young people in the study of the Party's educational policy, she resolved to change her simple method of criticism and patiently educate Fang Wenhua to become a good child.

    Wang Ehua visited Fang Wenhua's home many times. Fang Wenhua received two different kinds of education at home: his mother had many children, was burdened with housework, and had a short temper, often pulling him over for a beating and scolding; his grandmother, however, doted on her eldest grandson, holding him in her arms all day, afraid he would be burned or scalded, and would not allow her daughter-in-law to discipline him. Thus, Fang Wenhua was not only unafraid of his mother's discipline but had also learned to hit and scold people. After Teacher Wang talked with the parents many times, Wenhua's parents stopped beating, scolding, and spoiling the child. They criticized him when he made mistakes and praised him when he showed merits and progress. In this way, family education was combined with school education.

    Wenhua also had some virtues that Teacher Wang loved. He was brave and energetic, and he could do well in anything he was willing to do. Although his homework was sloppy, he had a strong understanding, and with a little effort, he scored five points in arithmetic. Wang Ehua seized this characteristic of Wenhua and proactively assigned him some tasks in the class, giving play to his advantages and talents, and diverting his energy to serving the collective. Last summer vacation, Wang Ehua put him in charge of checking the students' holiday assignments. He was extremely happy and diligently checked and recorded the students' work situation from house to house, reporting to the teacher every three to five days. After the autumn semester started, Wang Ehua praised Fang Wenhua's serious and responsible spirit in front of all the students. The students then elected him as the first student to be on duty in the class. Fang Wenhua received the trust of the teachers and students for the first time, and he was very happy in his heart, silently telling himself: "Don't be naughty again."

    Wenhua has a strong sense of self-esteem, and direct criticism and accusations often do not work. Wang Ehua adopted the educational method of enlightenment and reasoning, making him consciously recognize and correct his mistakes. Once, when Wang Ehua was teaching a language lesson, she found that Fang Wenhua was not listening carefully and was constantly teasing his classmates and making noise. She didn't say anything at the time. After class, she called Wenhua to the teacher's room and said, "Today, I remembered the story of poor students studying, but I can't remember the plot details. Can you tell me about it?" After Fang Wenhua told the stories of two poor children, Cheng Gong and Qiu Yong, studying, Wang Ehua gently and patiently said to Wenhua, "Look, when they were young, they worked for landlords during the day, and they still tried to study at night. They didn't have lamps, so they caught fireflies to use as light, and they didn't have pens, so they used small sticks to draw in the sand. They still wanted to study despite being beaten and bullied. Now, Chairman Mao cares about children everywhere. If we don't study hard, how can we become successors to communism?" Wenhua said, "Teacher Wang, I am not as good as them. I made trouble again in class today, and I didn't listen carefully. I was wrong."

    Wang Ehua and Fang Wenhua spent many holidays and rest times together. She carefully cared for his life and study, and she used positive education methods whenever she had the opportunity to enlighten his awareness. After repeated and patient education, Fang Wenhua finally slowly changed. He no longer hit or scolded classmates, nor did he make noise in the classroom. He listened to lessons and did homework more carefully than before, and the phenomenon of failing grades had disappeared. Once, when he was the student on duty (responsible for checking students' homework), he found that Wei Hanmin and Luo Tianwei had not finished their homework, so he stayed with them after class until they finished their homework before going home.

    When working in the school's vegetable garden, Fang Wenhua always took the lead. The students elected him as the production team leader, and when they established a vegetable production cooperative, they also elected him as the president. After school, he no longer argued with his mother and grandmother, and he helped the family fetch water and sweep the floor whenever he had time.

    At the end of last year, Fang Wenhua applied to join the Young Pioneers for the fourth time. This time, when the Young Pioneers discussed it, they thought that he worked and studied very seriously, was willing to help others, and had made great progress, and they unanimously agreed to let him become a Young Pioneer. On New Year's Day this year, Fang Wenhua was approved to join the Young Pioneers. At the swearing-in ceremony, the counselor hung a brand-new red scarf around Fang Wenhua's neck and said to him, "Be prepared to fight for the realization of communism." Fang Wenhua solemnly replied, "Always ready!"

### 方文虎入队

    方文虎入队
    新华社记者　张碨
    方文虎是武汉市武昌区西大街小学四年级的学生，一个十二岁的男孩子。
    一年以前，方文虎学习不努力，还爱骂人、打架，扰乱课堂秩序。他每学期的品行都是丁等、丙等，他爸爸问他：“为什么人家得甲等，你得丁等？”他就说：“他们是怕事鬼。”班主任王萼华不止一次找他谈话，但他不是跟老师辩驳，就是鼓着嘴死不吭声。王老师气急了，对他说：“从今天起，你再不要打骂人了；如果再继续犯错误，那我当真要开除你。”但是，方文虎最多好上两天，又闹翻了天。哪里发生打架的事情，准有他在场。终于，方文虎闯下了大祸。这一天，下课之后，方文虎正在玩集邮，同学刘光辉看见他邮票多，跟他开玩笑说：“邮票是偷来的吧？”一句话激怒了方文虎，他猛地站起来，一拳头把刘光辉打得鼻孔里直淌血，躺在地上不能动弹。校长、学生家长都来了，被打伤的同学送到了医院里。
    王老师为这件事气得浑身发抖。今后对方文虎怎么办呢？她检查了自己对方文虎的教育方法，想到在学习党的教育方针中，学校一再号召教师要加强少年儿童的共产主义教育，于是她决心改变简单的批评方式，耐心教育方文虎成为一个好孩子。
    王萼华多次访问了方文虎的家庭。方文虎在家里受着两种不同方式的教育：妈妈孩子多，家务繁，火气很大，动不动把他拉来打一顿，骂一场；祖母对她这长孙却十分娇惯，整天把他捧在手心里，怕烧着烫着，不许儿媳妇管教。这样，就使方文虎对母亲的管教不但丝毫不怕，反而学会了去打人骂人。经过王老师多次和家长交谈，文虎的家长再不打骂和娇惯孩子了，孩子有了错误就批评，孩子有优点、有进步也表扬。这样一来，家庭教育便和学校教育结合在一起了。
    文虎也有些优点很使王萼华喜爱。他勇敢，活动力强，只要是他愿意作的事情，就能做得很好。他虽然作业草率，但他理解力强，稍用点功，算术便考了五分。王萼华抓住文虎这个特点，便主动把班上一些事情分配给他做，发挥他的优点和才能，把他的精力转移到为集体办事上来。去年暑假，王萼华让他负责检查同学的假期作业。他高兴极了，挨家挨户地认真去检查和记载同学对待作业的情况，每隔三、五天就向老师汇报一次。秋季开学后，王萼华在全体同学面前表扬了方文虎认真负责的精神，同学们都选他当班上的第一个值日生。方文虎第一次得到了老师和同学们的信任，心里很高兴，默默地嘱咐自己：“今后再不要顽皮。”
    文虎自尊心很强，单刀直入的批评、指责，往往不能收到效果。王萼华便采取了启发、说理的教育方法，使他自觉地认识和改正错误。有一次，王萼华上语文课时，发现方文虎不好好听讲，还不时逗引同学嘻闹。她当时没讲什么。下课后，她把文虎叫到教师的房子来，说：“我今天想起了苦学生读书的故事，可是，故事情节我记不清了，你给我讲讲好吗？”方文虎讲了承宫和丘永两个苦孩子读书的故事以后，王萼华温和而耐心地对文虎说：“你看，他们小时候白天给地主干活，晚上还想办法读书，没有灯，只好捉萤火虫当亮儿，没有笔就拿小棍子在沙土上划。挨打受气，他们还要读书。现在，毛主席处处关心儿童，再不好好读书，怎能当共产主义接班人呢？”文虎说：“王老师，我太不如他们了，今天在课堂上，我又捣乱，不好好听讲，我错了。”
    王萼华和方文虎一起度过了不少的假日和休息时间。她细心地关怀着他的生活和学习，一有机会便用正面教育的办法，启发他的觉悟。经过反复耐心的教育，方文虎终于慢慢地转变了。他不再打骂同学，也不在课堂上嘻闹，听课和作业都比过去认真，已经消灭了不及格的现象。有一次，他担任班值日生（责任是检查同学作业）时，发现魏汉民和罗天尉的作业没有作完，下课后就陪他们留下，一直等他们把作业作完才回家去。
    在学校菜园里劳动的时候，方文虎总是领先干。同学们选他担任生产队长，成立蔬菜生产合作社时，又选他当社长。放学回家后，他不再和妈妈、奶奶顶嘴，一有空就帮助家里挑水、扫地。
    去年年底，方文虎第四次申请加入少先队。这一次，少先队员们在讨论的时候，认为他工作、学习很认真，也肯帮助别人，进步很大，一致同意他成为一个少先队员。今年元旦那天，方文虎被批准入队了。在入队宣誓会上，辅导员把一条崭新的红领巾挂在方文虎的脖颈上，对他说：“要准备着，为实现共产主义而奋斗。”方文虎严肃地回答道：“时刻准备着！”
