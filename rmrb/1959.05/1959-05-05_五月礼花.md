May Fireworks

"High, Precision, Large" Grinding Machine
    On April 27th, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant produced a high-grade, precision, and large-sized roll grinding machine. This grinding machine weighs 45 tons and is 9 meters long. It can grind large rolls (important parts of rolling mills) with a diameter of 1 meter and a length of 5 meters, with a precision reaching an error of no more than one-third of a hair's breadth within one meter.

"Women's Leap Forward"
    A lighter built by female workers who had recently joined the factory was launched at the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard on the afternoon of April 27th. This lighter is 50 meters long and has a load capacity of 300 tons. It was proposed by the female workers in the shipbuilding workshop during "March 8th" International Women's Day, and its name is "Women's Leap Forward."

"Mud-Discharging Rubber Hose"
    The "special mud-discharging rubber hose" used for dredging the Grand Canal of China from north to south has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Rubber Factory.
    Ordinary rubber hoses are used for water intake and drainage, while this rubber hose can be used for mud discharge.

Waterproof Flashlight
    The Shanghai Huiming Flashlight Battery Factory has recently trial-produced a precise plastic waterproof flashlight that does not leak water even when placed in water. It is unbreakable and does not rust; the illumination distance can reach 300 meters. This flashlight is of great use to industry, forestry, fishery, and underwater work, and has now been put into production and will soon be available on the market.

"Plywood Tugboat"
    On the morning of April 27th, a 90-horsepower diesel engine tugboat with a plywood structure was launched at the Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1.
    This new tugboat does not use steel or whole pieces of wood. The entire ship, from the keel and ribs to the hull planks, masts, and hold planks, is glued together with thin pieces of wood, small materials, and thin boards. This type of tugboat saves steel and whole pieces of wood, and the hull is light, has a shallow draft, and has great buoyancy, enabling it to travel in shallow waterways. Because the adhesive itself is anti-corrosive, the service life of the ship is also longer. (Attached picture)
    The clock and watch machine tools produced by the Shanghai Clock and Watch Machine Tool Factory have a maximum speed of 6,000 revolutions per minute and weigh only 10 kilograms. The quality of the machine tools is very good.

    五月礼花
    “高、精、大”磨床
    上海机床厂4月27日制成了一台高级、精密、大型的轧辊磨床。这台磨床重四十五吨，长九公尺，可磨直径一公尺、长五公尺的大型轧辊（轧钢机的重要部件），精度达到一公尺内误差不超过一根头发丝的三分之一。
    “妇女跃进号”
    一艘由刚进厂不久的女工们建造的囤船4月27日下午在上海江南造船厂下水。这艘囤船长五十公尺，载重三百吨，是造船车间女工在“三八”节时提出要建造的，它的名字叫“妇女跃进号”。
    “排泥的胶管”
    疏浚我国南北大运河用的“排泥特殊胶管”，最近已在上海橡胶厂试制成功。
    一般胶管是吸水、排水用的，而这种胶管可以作排泥之用。
    不渗水的电筒
    上海汇明电筒电池厂最近试制成一种精密的塑胶防水电筒，放在水中也不渗水，既摔不坏，又不会生锈；照射距离可达三百公尺。这种电筒对工业、林业、渔业以及海底工作，都有很大用处，现已投入生产，不久即可供应市场。
    “胶合板拖轮”
    4月27日清晨，上海木材一厂有一艘胶合板结构的九十马力柴油机拖轮下水。
    这艘新拖轮，既不用钢，也不用整块木材，全船从龙筋、肋骨，船壳板到桅杆、仓板，都是用木材的薄片、小料、薄板等胶合而成。这种拖轮，既节省了钢材和整块木材，而且船体轻，吃水浅，浮力大，能在浅水河道中行驶。因为胶合剂本身就是防腐的，所以船的使用寿命也较长。（附图片）
    上海钟表机床厂生产的钟表机床，最高转速为六千转，重量只有十公斤，机床的质量很好。
