All enterprises should constantly pay attention to strengthening technical management, abide by technological regulations and operating procedures, eliminate defective products, reduce substandard products, strictly implement the inspection system from raw materials, materials, semi-finished products to finished products, and strive to ensure that every product leaving the factory meets the quality standards stipulated by the state.

    无论是重工业产品，或者是轻工业产品，都必须保证优良的质量。这是增产节约的一项重要任务。所有企业，都应当经常地注意加强技术管理，遵守工艺规程和操作规程，消灭废品，减少次品，严格执行从原料、材料、半成品直到成品的检验制度，努力争取每一件出厂的产品都符合国家规定的质量标准。
