Xinhua News Agency, 10th.  Guests of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, including Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, Mr. Dieckmann, First Deputy Chairman Mr. Matern, and the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic led by them, had a cordial meeting this morning with members of the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of the capital. In the meeting, First Deputy Chairman Matern praised the friendship between the people of Germany and China, which will continue to develop and always blossom like flowers.

The Sino-German Friendship People's Commune was named in January this year when Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic visited here. At the naming ceremony, Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out that the naming of the commune was sowing the seeds of deepening the friendship between Germany and China, and he hoped that this seed would sprout and grow. Today, when the envoys of the German people visited again, Fu Zongkun, the Party Secretary of the commune, once again stated that the members of the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune, like the entire Chinese people, will always cherish the friendship between China and Germany and strive to develop this friendship.

Dongba, where the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune is located, was today bathed in an atmosphere of internationalist fraternal friendship. More than a thousand male and female members of the commune, holding colorful flowers, lined both sides of the village road, joyfully waiting for the distinguished guests to visit them.

At around 8 a.m., amidst warm applause and cheers, Chairman Dieckmann and First Deputy Chairman Matern, Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China Mr. Wang Daer, and other distinguished guests, accompanied by Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Feng, Standing Committee member Xu Bing, Deputy Secretary-General Lian Guan, Vice Mayor of Beijing Feng Jiping, and others, arrived in Dongba by car.

In the commune's lounge, Fu Zongkun introduced to the distinguished guests the rapid development of production in the commune since it was named in January. He said that our commune being named the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune is the most glorious thing for all our members. Since the beginning of this year, the members have carried out good management of the overwintering wheat fields, the sowing period for spring crops was one week earlier than last year, and more than 700,000 jin of vegetables have been produced to meet the needs of the capital. Fu Zongkun said that these developments in the commune are inseparable from the enthusiastic help and encouragement of the people of the German Democratic Republic. After Fu Zongkun introduced the situation, Chairman Dieckmann, First Deputy Chairman Matern, and other distinguished guests had a cordial conversation with the hosts.

Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the guests and hosts exchanged gifts. Among the many precious gifts that the distinguished guests gave to the commune members were the national flag of the German Democratic Republic and a portrait of President Pieck. When Fu Zongkun took the national flag and portrait with both hands, the commune band played "Socialism is Good," and the members repeatedly applauded warmly to thank the German people for their care. The members of the commune gave the distinguished guests special handicrafts such as cloisonné vases and drawnwork tablecloths made by themselves. At this enthusiastic and friendly moment, First Deputy Chairman Matern spoke to the members, congratulating the commune on achieving greater success in production, wishing the members a happy life, and wishing the friendship between Germany and China to always blossom like flowers. Finally, Fu Zongkun also asked the distinguished guests to convey the members' respect and greetings to the esteemed President Pieck, Prime Minister Grotewohl, and the fraternal German people.

    中德友谊永远像花朵样盛开
    德国议院代表团访问中德人民公社
    新华社10日讯　德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、第一副主席马特恩以及由他们率领的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团的贵宾们，今天上午同首都郊区中德友好人民公社的社员们作了亲切的会见。马特恩第一副主席在会见中赞颂德中两国人民的友谊永远发展，永远像花朵盛开。
    中德友好人民公社是在今年1月间德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥访问这里时命名的。格罗提渥总理在命名仪式上指出公社的命名是播下了加深德中友谊的种子，他希望这颗种子发芽长大。今天，当德国人民的使者再次来访的时候，这个公社的党委书记傅宗昆再一次表示，中德友好人民公社的社员同全中国人民一样，将永远珍视中德友谊，并为发展这种友谊而努力。
    中德友好人民公社所在地的东坝今天沐浴在国际主义兄弟友谊的气氛中。一千多男女社员手执彩花，喜气洋洋，排列在村道两旁，迎候贵宾们到他们这里来作客。
    八时多，在一片热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，狄克曼主席和马特恩第一副主席，德意志民主共和国驻我国大使汪戴尔等贵宾们，在人大常委会副委员长林枫、常务委员徐冰、副秘书长连贯，北京市副市长冯基平等陪同，乘车到了东坝。
    在公社的休息室里，傅宗昆向贵宾们介绍了公社自1月份被命名后生产飞跃发展的情况。他说，我们的公社命名为中德友好人民公社，这是我们全体社员感到最光荣的事情。今年以来社员们对越冬麦田进行了很好的管理，春播作物的播种期比去年提前了一个星期，还生产了七十多万斤蔬菜，供应了首都的需要。傅宗昆说，公社的这些发展是和德意志民主共和国人民的热情帮助和鼓舞分不开的。在傅宗昆介绍情况之后，狄克曼主席、马特恩第一副主席和其他贵宾们同主人们进行了亲切的交谈。
    在一片锣鼓声中，宾主互相赠送了礼物。贵宾们赠给社员们的许多珍贵的礼物中有德意志民主共和国国旗和一幅皮克总统的画像。当傅宗昆双手接过国旗和画像的时候，公社乐队奏起“社会主义好”，社员们一再热烈鼓掌感谢德国人民的关怀。公社的社员们给贵宾们赠送了他们自己制造的景泰蓝花瓶、挑花桌布等特种手工艺品。在这热情洋溢、充满友情的时刻，马特恩第一副主席向社员们讲话，祝贺公社生产获得更大的成就，祝社员们生活幸福，祝德中友谊永远像花朵一样盛开。傅宗昆最后还请贵宾们把社员们的敬意和问候带给敬爱的皮克总统、格罗提渥总理和兄弟的德国人民。
