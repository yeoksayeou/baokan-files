Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th - Henan Province's finance, trade, and health departments have made various preparations to support the summer harvest.

Harvesting and threshing tools for the summer harvest are ready. As early as spring, commercial department staff, while supplying spring plowing production materials, began to prepare tools for the summer harvest and planting. They went deep into communes and production teams, combining the development of diversified economies, to conduct "four checks and four calculations" of production materials, namely, checking production and calculating needs, checking existing quantities and calculating surpluses and deficits, checking seasons and calculating time, and checking production equipment and calculating raw materials, helping people's communes and production brigades formulate production plans and sign purchase and supply contracts. By mid-May, the province had supplied 66.29 million pieces of various small farm tools. Coupled with farm tools produced and used by the people's communes themselves, they can already meet the needs of the summer harvest.

With the bumper harvest of summer crops, this summer's grain storage will be greater than in previous years, and the storage time will be longer. In addition to preparing sufficient granaries to welcome the entry of procured grain, the grain departments have also helped people's communes and production teams arrange grain storage plans, preparing more than 170,000 granaries and training more than 33,000 peasant grain keepers. This work is still being intensified.

The mobile repair groups and field stores organized by the commercial departments are preparing to enter the wheat harvesting sites to help farmers repair farm tools and supply daily necessities on the spot. Medical personnel supporting the summer harvest are ready to go. They have put forward the slogan "Carrying medicine kits on their shoulders and sickles in their hands, treating illnesses when there are illnesses, and engaging in production when there are no illnesses." Medical personnel in the Xuchang area have also proposed that after going to the countryside, they should achieve three samenesses (eating, living, and laboring with the peasants) and three arrivals (seeing patients in the fields, in the canteens, and in the homes of the sick).

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - Primary and secondary school teachers and students in various parts of Jiangsu Province have successively begun their agricultural busy season holiday from May 20th, actively supporting the summer harvest and planting.

All schools regard supporting the summer harvest and planting as an important task. Schools have established agricultural busy season work leading groups, formulated specific work plans, and conducted serious research and comprehensive arrangements for activities during the agricultural busy season. In order to adapt to the technical requirements of summer harvest and planting, many schools have conducted technical training for students in transplanting rice seedlings, etc. The Jingjiang County Industrial School, Yancheng County Xiyao Primary School, and others have sent some students to production teams for internships.

The broad masses of teachers and students are all jubilant, full of fighting spirit, and greet the bumper harvest with practical actions. In Yangzhou County, more than 15,000 teachers and students participating in the summer harvest and planting harvested more than 3,300 mu of wheat and picked up more than 35,000 jin of wheat ears in three days. In Gaochun County, Hejia Primary School and others, in supporting the summer harvest and planting, older students reaped wheat, treadled waterwheels, and transplanted rice seedlings; younger students picked up wheat and gathered mulberry leaves. While actively working, the students of various schools also helped commune members learn culture, record work points, and read newspapers, etc.

    人人鼓干劲　收好又种好
    城乡协作　丰产丰收
    河南财贸卫生部门作好各种准备
    江苏中小学师生下乡帮助收麦
    新华社郑州30日电　河南全省财贸、卫生部门已经作好各种准备，支援夏收。
    夏收用的收割打场工具已经备妥。早在春季，商业部门职工在供应春耕生产资料的同时，便开始准备夏收夏种工具。他们深入公社和生产队结合发展多种经济，进行生产资料的“四查四算”工作，即查生产算需要，查现有数量算余缺，查季节算时间，查生产设备算原材料，帮助人民公社和生产大队制定生产规划，签订收购供应合同。到5月中旬，全省供应了各种小件农具六千六百二十九万件，加上人民公社自产自用的农具，已经能够满足夏收的需要。
    随着夏收作物丰收，今年夏季的粮食储存量将比往年多，储存的时间也将比往年长。粮食部门除准备了足够的粮仓，迎接征购粮食入库以外，还帮助人民公社和生产队安排了贮粮计划，备好粮仓十七万多座，训练农民粮食保管员三万三千多人。这些工作目前还在加紧进行。
    商业部门组织的流动修配组、田间商店，正准备开入麦收现场，就地帮助农民修理农具和供应生活用品。支援夏收的医务人员正整装待发。他们提出“肩背药包手拿镰，有病就治病，无病搞生产”的口号。许昌专区的医务人员，还提出下乡后要做到三同（与农民同吃、同住、同劳动）、三到（看病到田间、到食堂、到病户）。
    据新华社南京30日电　江苏省各地中、小学师生，从5月20日起先后开始放农忙假，积极支援夏收夏种。
    各学校都把支援夏收夏种当作一项重要任务。学校里专门成立了农忙工作领导小组，订出具体的工作计划，对农忙期间的活动作了认真研究和全面安排。为了适应夏收夏种技术上的要求，不少学校对学生进行莳秧等技术训练。靖江县工业学校、盐城县西尧小学等都派出了一部分学生到生产队实习。
    广大师生个个欢欣鼓舞，斗志昂扬，以实际行动迎接大丰收。扬中县参加夏收夏种的一万五千多名师生，在三天中就割麦三千三百多亩，拾麦穗三万五千多斤。高淳县何家小学等在支援夏收夏种中，年龄大的学生割麦、车水、插秧；年龄小的拾麦、采桑。各学校学生在积极劳动的同时，还帮助社员学文化，记工分，读报纸等。
