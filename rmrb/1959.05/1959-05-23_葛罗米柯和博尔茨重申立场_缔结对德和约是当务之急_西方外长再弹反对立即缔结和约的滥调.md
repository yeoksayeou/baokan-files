Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 22nd -- TASS reports: The Foreign Ministers' Conference was chaired by Lloyd on the 21st, and the foreign ministers continued to exchange views on the issues under discussion at the conference.

French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville was the first to speak at the meeting. He said that the conference was at a stage where the delegations had explained their views to each other, so it was important not to leave any ambiguity in this regard. Therefore, he expressed his willingness to comment on Gromyko's speech yesterday.

The head of the French delegation said that the statement by our Soviet colleagues that their delegation would do everything possible to find common ground and bring our positions closer was a positive statement. Couve de Murville assured them that they would also strive to reach an agreement, but at the same time, he said that the conference did not seem to have reached the stage where it could begin discussing the proposals submitted to the conference for review, although at recent meetings, Herter, Lloyd and Couve de Murville himself had touched upon many specific issues in the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany.

Couve de Murville again attempted to make the "package plan" proposed by the three countries, which would indefinitely delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, more attractive. He said: I have never said that we do not raise the issue of a peace treaty. What I said was that as long as there are two Germanys and Berlin, concluding a peace treaty is impossible, unnecessary, and inappropriate.

Couve de Murville said that we do not think it is necessary to conclude a peace treaty with each of the two parts of Germany that currently exist separately. However, he avoided addressing the question raised by the Soviet delegation during the discussion: if so, why does the United States think it can conclude an agreement with the government of one of the two Germanys, namely the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, aimed at remilitarizing the latter?

In his speech, the head of the French delegation rehashed the unfounded old tune, insisting that concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys would solidify the divided status quo of Germany, although in fact, the peace treaty would create favorable conditions for developing contacts between the two Germanys and their rapprochement on this basis. However, Couve de Murville revealed a real reason why Western countries are unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. He bluntly said that the reason he holds this attitude is because the Western countries' governments abhor "the system of the German Democratic Republic," that is, abhor the social system established there according to the will of the people.

Lloyd spoke as the representative of the United Kingdom. He was pleased that the Soviet delegation had found some positive elements in the Western countries' "peace plan," and that Gromyko had expressed in his speech his willingness to explore the possibility of bringing the positions of the Soviet Union and the Western countries closer on the issues under discussion.

Lloyd said that he saw some positive elements in Gromyko's speech on the 20th regarding the reunification of Germany, namely: the Soviet government has no intention of permanently dividing Germany, and the Soviet government does not oppose holding free elections and plebiscites in Germany. However, he then repeated the well-known reasons of the three Western countries, according to which all issues such as restoring German unity, holding all-German elections, and organizing all-German joint committees for this purpose should not be resolved by the Germans themselves, not by the German people, but by the four major powers.

Like Couve de Murville, the head of the British delegation also used the fact that Western countries do not consider the German Democratic Republic "representative" as a "reason" for their unwillingness to sign a peace treaty with the two Germanys.

After Lloyd's speech, West German representative Grewe spoke. Although the representative of the Bonn government verbally advocated German unification, he opposed any attempts to bring the two Germanys closer. He tried to prove that the idea of ​​the two Germanys forming a confederation was difficult to realize due to the different social systems of the two Germanys. At the same time, Grewe made slanderous attacks on the German Democratic Republic. He said that he believed that the only constructive and practical way to eliminate the differences at this foreign ministers' meeting was to discuss the West's "peace plan" in detail.

German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz expressed at the meeting the German Democratic Republic government's views on the draft peace treaty with Germany. He said that the German Democratic Republic delegation believes that concluding a peace treaty with Germany is an important action, whether from a domestic or an international perspective. Bolz said that we welcome the situation that, although some delegations have reservations, the conference has after all begun to discuss the issue of a peace treaty.

After expressing his hope to continue discussing this issue, Bolz analyzed the basic issues of the peace treaty in detail and determined the German Democratic Republic's views on these issues. He pointed out that the draft peace treaty is in line with the German people's national aspirations. Without a peace treaty, the division of Germany will deepen; without a peace treaty, German militarists will not only accelerate general armament, but will also begin to arm themselves with rocket weapons and atomic weapons, which will aggravate the threat to peace.

Bolz finally said that it is absolutely necessary to insist on concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. The peace treaty will enable Germany to obtain full self-determination and will deprive German militarism of any possibility of development. He said that it is in this sense that the German Democratic Republic delegation will work together to seek an agreement on the peace treaty and the peace conference.

Gromyko then spoke at the meeting. When talking about on what basis the participants can bring each other's positions closer, he said that first, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and related proposals must be studied, but other irrelevant issues cannot be dragged in. He said that in order to bring positions closer, it must be guaranteed that a peace treaty is concluded that can prevent Germany from developing as a militarist country.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government firmly believes that in order to normalize the situation in Germany, to ease tensions between the two Germanys and in Europe, and to create favorable conditions for the rapprochement of the two Germanys, a peace treaty with Germany must be concluded, and under the current circumstances, a peace treaty must be concluded with the two Germanys. Gromyko emphasized that the people of all countries are concerned about this matter.

The last speaker was Herter. He expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that some people pointed out the danger of West German armament and the aggressiveness of the North Atlantic bloc during the meeting. He said that this hinders serious discussion of the issues facing the meeting.

The next meeting is scheduled for May 22.

### 葛罗米柯和博尔茨重申立场  缔结对德和约是当务之急  西方外长再弹反对立即缔结和约的滥调

    葛罗米柯和博尔茨重申立场
    缔结对德和约是当务之急
    西方外长再弹反对立即缔结和约的滥调
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：外长会议21日由劳埃德担任主席，外长们就会议讨论的问题继续交换意见。
    法国外交部长德姆维尔在会议上第一个发言。他说，目前会议处在这样一个阶段：各代表团彼此解释了自己的观点，因此，重要的是不要在这方面留下任何不明确的地方。于是，他表示愿意就葛罗米柯昨天的发言发表一些意见。
    法国代表团团长说，我们的苏联同行声明，他的代表团将尽一切力量，试图找到共同的观点，使我们的立场接近，这是一个积极的声明。德姆维尔一面保证他们这方面也力求达成协议，但同时却说，会议似乎还没有达到可以开始讨论提交给会议审查的建议的阶段，虽然在最近的会议上，赫脱、劳埃德和德姆维尔本人已经涉及到苏联的对德和约草案中的许多具体问题。
    德姆维尔又企图把三国提出的、无限期拖延缔结对德和约的“一揽子计划”说得更加诱人。他说：我从来没有说过，我们不提和约问题。我说的是，只要存在着有两个德国和柏林这种情况，缔结和约是不可能的、没有必要的、也是不适宜的。
    德姆维尔说，我们不认为必须同目前分别存在的德国两个部分中的每一部分缔结和约。可是他在这里避而不谈苏联代表团在讨论过程中所提出的问题：既然如此，为什么美国认为可以同两个德国中的一个德国的政府，也就是同德意志联邦共和国政府缔结旨在使后者重新军国主义化的协定呢？
    法国代表团团长在发言中重弹了毫无根据的老调，硬说同两个德国缔结和约会使德国分裂的现状固定下来，虽然实际上，和约会为发展两个德国之间的接触和它们在这个基础上的接近创造良好条件。不过，德姆维尔却吐露了西方国家不愿意同德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国缔结和约的一个真正原因。他直言不讳地说，他之所以抱这种态度，是因为西方国家政府憎恶“德意志民主共和国的制度”，也就是说，憎恶根据人民意志在那里确立起来的社会制度。
    劳埃德以英国代表的身分发言。他感到满意的是：苏联代表团从西方国家的“和平计划”中发现某些积极因素，葛罗米柯在发言中表示愿意就所讨论的问题探求苏联和西方国家态度接近的可能性。
    劳埃德说，他从葛罗米柯20日有关恢复德国统一问题的那一部分发言中看到某些积极因素，即：苏联政府无意永远分裂德国，苏联政府不反对在德国举行自由选举和全民投票。但是，他接着又重复了西方三国的人所共知的理由，根据这种理由，恢复德国统一、举行全德选举和为此而组织全德混合委员会等所有问题不应由德国人自己，不应由德国人民来解决，而应由四大国来解决。
    英国代表团团长也像德姆维尔一样，以西方国家不认为德意志民主共和国“具有代表性”作为它们不愿意同两个德国签订和约的“理由”。
    在劳埃德发言以后，西德代表格雷韦发言。这位波恩政府的代表虽然口头上主张德国统一，可是，他却反对两个德国接近的任何尝试。他力图证明，似乎由于两个德国的社会制度不同，两个德国成立邦联的主张是难以实现的。同时，格雷韦对德意志民主共和国进行了诬蔑性的攻击。他说，他认为，消除这次外长会议上的分歧的唯一建设性的和实际可行的道路便是只详细讨论西方的“和平计划”。
    德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨在会议上表示了德意志民主共和国政府对对德和约草案的看法。他说，德意志民主共和国代表团认为，缔结对德和约，不论从本国角度看来，或者从国际角度看来，都是一个重要行动。博尔茨说，我们对这种情况表示欢迎，即虽然某些代表团持有保留条件，但是，会议毕竟已经开始讨论和约问题。
    博尔茨在表示希望继续讨论这一问题之后，详细分析了和约的基本问题，并确定了德意志民主共和国对这些问题的看法。他指出，和约草案符合德国人民的民族愿望。没有和约，德国的分裂将加深；没有和约，德国军国主义者不仅将要加速一般武装，而且还将开始用火箭武器和原子武器来武装，这样一来，将加剧对和平的威胁。
    博尔茨最后说，完全必须坚持尽快缔结对德和约，和约将使德国获得充分的自决权，并且将使德国军国主义失去一切发展的可能。他说，正是在这个意义上，德意志民主共和国代表团将协力求得关于和约和和会的协议。
    接着在会上发言的是葛罗米柯。他在谈到与会者在怎样的基础上才能使彼此的立场互相接近时说，首先必须研究对德和约问题及与之有关的建议，但是，不能把其他不相干的问题拉扯在一起。他说，为了立场的接近，必须保证缔结这样一个和约，这个和约要能够制止德国作为一个军国主义国家发展。
    葛罗米柯表示，苏联政府坚信，为了使德国的局势正常化，为了缓和两个德国之间的紧张局势和欧洲紧张局势，以及为了给两个德国的接近创造良好条件，必须缔结对德和约，在当前情况下，必须同两个德国缔结和约。葛罗米柯强调指出，各国人民都关心这件事。
  　最后一个发言的是赫脱。他对在会议过程中有人指出西德武装的危险性和北大西洋集团的侵略性这一点表示不满。他说，这妨碍认真地讨论会议所面临的问题。
    下次会议定于5月22日举行。
