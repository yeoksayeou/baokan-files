Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th - The numbers of pigs and chickens in Liaoning Province are rising monthly. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of April, the number of hogs in the province had reached 3.5 million, an increase of 11% compared to the end of last year. The number of chickens has grown to 10 million, an increase of 43% compared to last year. Some advanced cities, counties, communes, and production teams in raising pigs and poultry have also emerged in various regions. The number of hogs raised in Kaiyuan County has increased by 61% compared to the end of last year. Fushun City had only 40,000 poultry at the end of last year, but by April, it had grown to over 400,000.
The reason for the above-mentioned achievements in the production of hogs and poultry in Liaoning Province is primarily due to the emphasis placed on it by leaders at all levels of the Party and government, with dedicated personnel responsible at each level, establishing a professional front and strengthening leadership. Currently, leadership organs at all levels above the county in the province have successively established specialized departments, bureaus, and sections to lead the production of non-staple foods. Arrangements have been made for the development plans for poultry and livestock production, the source of hatching eggs and breeding pigs, and feed. During critical periods of production, socialist labor competitions were launched, inspections and evaluations were conducted, and on-site meetings were held to promote advanced experiences.
In developing hog and poultry production, various localities have also earnestly implemented the principle of giving equal importance to collective and private raising, and have vigorously assisted commune members in solving various specific problems such as the source of pigs, incubation equipment, and arranging feed land, which has greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for raising pigs and poultry. Commercial departments at the provincial, county, and commune levels have also provided economic support to commune members in developing pig and chicken production, vigorously promoting the experience of transforming one commercial cadre into three (purchasing agent, epidemic prevention officer, and production instructor) among commercial cadres, and organizing them to assist communes in providing technical guidance for raising poultry and livestock.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th - Two production teams in Shen County, Hebei Province, have implemented the principle of combining collective pig raising by communes and production teams with family pig raising by commune members, and are actively helping commune member families raise pigs.
One of these two production teams is the Duanjiazuo Production Team of Tangfeng Commune, with a total of 884 people and 1,007 pigs. The other is the Nanwangzhuang Production Team of Jiaoqiu Commune, with a total of 1,465 people and 1,700 pigs. Both have reached an average of more than one pig per person. Because they raise many pigs, they also sell more pigs to the state. For example, the Duanjiazuo Production Team sold 220 fat pigs weighing more than 150 jin to the state in the first quarter of this year and plans to sell more than 800 to the state throughout the year. With more pigs, more fertilizer, and increased grain production in agricultural production. The Duanjiazuo Production Team cultivates 1,500 mu of land. In 1958, due to afforestation for sand prevention, water conservancy construction, and increased fertilization, the grain yield per mu reached 600 jin, and pig raising and fertilizer accumulation was an important reason. The average grain yield per mu of the Nanwangzhuang Production Team in 1958 also reached 444 jin, which is more than double the yield of another nearby production team with less pig raising.
These two teams have great potential to further develop pig raising, especially the potential of commune member families to raise pigs. Most commune members have pig pens, pig troughs, and other equipment at home. In order to tap these potentials, under the unified leadership of their respective communes, both teams are helping commune member families to further develop pig raising. The Duanjiazuo Production Team has decided to allocate a certain amount of feed land to commune member families for self-cultivation and self-use, and has arranged the pig raising time for commune members and made reasonable regulations on the price of purchasing pig manure from commune members. The Nanwangzhuang Production Team has also taken similar measures. In this way, the enthusiasm of the two teams of commune members for family pig raising has been improved. More than 140 households in the Duanjiazuo Production Team have reported that they are raising pigs, and plan to raise 154 pigs; in the Nanwangzhuang Production Team, only 27 out of 325 households (mostly five-guarantee households and single men) did not raise pigs. The masses said: "We were able to raise them in the past without feed land, how can we not raise more now?"

### 建立专业战线　层层有人负责  辽宁生猪家禽数量逐月上升  河北深县两个生产队大力帮助社员养猪

    建立专业战线　层层有人负责
    辽宁生猪家禽数量逐月上升
    河北深县两个生产队大力帮助社员养猪
    新华社沈阳30日电　辽宁省猪、鸡数量逐月上升。据不完全统计，到4月末止，全省生猪头数已达三百五十万头，比去年年底增加了11％，鸡已发展到一千万只，比去年增加了43％；各地还出现了一些养猪、养禽的先进市、县、公社和生产队。开原县现在饲养的生猪头数，已比去年年底增加了61％，抚顺市去年年底只有家禽四万只，4月份已发展到四十多万只。
    辽宁省的生猪和家禽生产取得上述成绩的原因，首先是由于各级党政领导部门重视，层层都有专人负责，建立了一条专业战线，加强了领导。现在，全省县以上的各级领导机关，都先后成立了领导副食品生产的专业部、局、科，对家禽、家畜生产的发展计划，种蛋、种猪和饲料的来源等，都作了安排。在生产关键时期，开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，进行了检查评比，并且召开现场会议，推广先进经验。
    在发展生猪和家禽生产中，各地还切实地贯彻了公养私养并重的方针，大力协助社员解决猪源、孵鸡设备和安排饲料地等各种具体问题，大大鼓舞了群众养猪养禽的积极性。省、县、公社商业部门还从经济方面支援社员们发展猪、鸡生产，在商业干部中大力推广一员变三员（采购员、防疫员、生产指导员）的经验，组织他们协助公社进行饲养家禽家畜的技术指导。
    新华社天津30日电　河北省深县两个生产队贯彻公社、生产队集体养猪和社员家庭养猪并举的方针，积极帮助社员家庭养猪。
    这两个生产队一个是唐奉公社的段家佐生产队，全队共有八百八十四人，养猪一千零七头；一个是角丘公社的南王庄生产队，共有一千四百六十五人，养猪一千七百头，平均都达到每人养猪一头以上。由于养猪多，它们卖给国家的猪也多。如段家佐生产队今年第一季度就卖给国家二百二十头一百五十斤以上的肥猪，全年计划卖给国家八百多头。这两个队猪养得多，肥料多，农业生产方面粮食也是增产的。段家佐生产队耕地一千五百亩，1958年由于造林防沙、修水利和多施肥，粮食亩产达六百斤，其中养猪积肥是一个重要的原因。南王庄生产队1958年的粮食平均亩产量也达四百四十四斤，比附近另一个养猪少的生产队的产量高出一倍以上。
    这两个队还有很大的潜力进一步发展养猪，特别是社员家庭养猪的潜力很大。大多数社员家里有猪圈、猪槽等设备。为了发挥这些潜力，两个队在各自的公社的统一领导下，都正在帮助社员家庭进一步发展养猪。段家佐生产队已决定给社员家庭拨一定的饲料地由社员自种自用，并对社员养猪时间作了安排，对收购社员猪粪的价格作了合理的规定。南王庄生产队也同样采取了类似的措施。这样，两队社员对家庭养猪的热情都提高了。段家佐生产队社员自报养猪的有一百四十多户，计划养猪一百五十四头；南王庄生产队三百二十五户只有二十七户（多半是五保户和单身汉）没有养猪。群众说：“过去没有饲料地都养了下来，现在还能不多养些？”
