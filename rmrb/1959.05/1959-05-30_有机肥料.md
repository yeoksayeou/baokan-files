    Increasing the Application of Organic Fertilizer is Key to Agricultural Production Increase

    Fertilizers include organic and inorganic fertilizers. Organic fertilizer is a self-sufficient fertilizer in rural areas, also known as farm fertilizer. Inorganic fertilizer is natural mineral and factory-made fertilizer, also known as chemical fertilizer. These two types of fertilizers differ greatly in properties, nutrient content, and fertilization effects. For thousands of years, the fertilizers used in rural China have mainly been organic fertilizers. This type of fertilizer has improved soil fertility and ensured agricultural production.

    Organic fertilizers include three main categories: human excrement and urine, livestock manure (mixed with weeds and straw called barnyard manure), and compost (or miscellaneous fertilizer). Green manure, cake fertilizer, bone fertilizer, soil fertilizers such as river and pond silt, old walls, kang soil, road soil, courtyard soil, smoked soil, etc., seafood waste such as inedible parts of fish, shrimp, clams, snails, etc., and slaughterhouse waste such as hides, hairs, hooves, and horns are all organic fertilizers. This article mainly discusses the three types of organic fertilizers: human excrement and urine, livestock manure, and compost (miscellaneous fertilizer).

    In 1958, the yields of grain and cash crops in China doubled. However, in that year, China's chemical fertilizer production was only 811,000 tons, which, calculated based on the country's 1.7 billion mu of farmland, was less than one jin per mu. In 1958, the fertilizers used were mainly organic fertilizers. The amount applied per mu of cultivated land increased from the previous three to two thousand jin to over ten thousand, fifty thousand, and one hundred thousand jin, resulting in an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    The biggest advantage of organic fertilizer is that the nutrient content is diverse, and although the effect is slower, it is long-lasting. Organic fertilizer contains a large amount of organic matter, which has the greatest advantage in maturing soil, improving soil properties, and preserving soil fertility. The experience of deep plowing and increased production in 1958 proved that applying more organic fertilizer is a key factor.

      Sources of Organic Fertilizer

    The sources of organic fertilizer are mainly human excrement and urine, livestock manure, and compost. Vegetable growing areas have the habit of applying human excrement and urine alone; in the past two or three years, rural areas in North China provinces have begun to apply urine to increase wheat production. The vast majority of rural areas use a mixture of the three fertilizers to make compost, such as soil manure in North China and pond manure in the southern paddy fields.

    Human excrement and urine are a complete fertilizer and also a quick-acting fertilizer. The nutrient utilization rate of human excrement and urine is equivalent to the effect of chemical fertilizer. China has 650 million people, with adults accounting for 300 million. The nitrogen content in the human excrement and urine excreted each year is 264.3 million jin, equivalent to 1,321,000 tons, which is equivalent to the nitrogen content in 6,605,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. Applying this amount of ammonium sulfate to the country's 1.7 billion mu of cultivated land would provide eight jin per mu, which is a huge figure. The phosphorus content is 408,000 tons, equivalent to the phosphorus content in 2,040,000 tons of superphosphate of lime. The potassium oxide content is 500,000 tons, equivalent to the potassium content in 1,040,000 tons of potassium sulfate. Although it is impossible to save all the feces and urine of everyone as fertilizer, if we attach importance to it with the same viewpoint as we do to chemical fertilizer, then the farm fertilizer with the greatest and fastest effect, human excrement and urine, can be greatly increased.

    Livestock manure is similar to human excrement and urine. It is also a complete fertilizer with a complete range of nutrients. The nutrient content (%) is generally listed in the table below.

    In China, the planned number of large livestock in 1958 was 88.27 million heads of cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules, and 150 million pigs. Based on this figure, the production and nutrient content of livestock manure, like human excrement and urine, is a huge source of fertilizer.

    In order to absorb urine and preserve nutrients, crushed soil is usually mixed into human excrement and urine, and weeds and straw are added to livestock manure to make barnyard manure, which greatly increases the amount of fertilizer and preserves the nutrients.

    Human excrement and urine contain a relatively large amount of nutrients and a relatively small amount of organic matter. It is best to mix it with materials that contain less nitrogen and more organic matter, such as crop stalks, weeds, and garbage, to make good compost. This can also greatly increase the amount of organic fertilizer and open up sources of fertilizer. Human and animal manure contain intestinal infectious disease germs, which accelerate the spread of these diseases when applied directly. Only through composting and fermentation can these pathogens be eliminated. Using human and animal manure mixed with crop stalks, weeds, and garbage to make compost is a valuable experience of Chinese farmers for many years and is the main method of fertilizer production in rural areas.

    Crop stalks are the residue after harvesting crops, and weeds, fallen leaves, garbage, etc. are waste products in rural areas. At present, although crop stalks in rural areas have their own specific uses, a large part can still be used to make fertilizer. Crop stalks are often places where various crop disease and insect pests reside. They must be composted and fermented to remove the diseases and pests before they can be used as fertilizer. The general nutrient content of crop stalks is listed in the table below (due to different sampling, the analysis results often vary):

    The nutrient content in crop stalks exists in extremely complex organic compounds. It cannot be absorbed and utilized by crops without decomposition and rotting. Therefore, it must be mixed with human excrement and urine and composted and fermented to be used as fertilizer. Adding 200 to 400 jin of human excrement and urine to 1,000 jin of dry crop stalks can make 2,000 to 2,500 jin of good compost. The nutrient content of this compost can be equivalent to 5,000 to 10,000 jin of ordinary soil manure. If 100 jin of crop stalks per mu of farmland are used to make fertilizer nationwide, approximately 340 to 425 million jin of good compost can be obtained, which contains nitrogen (assuming the average nitrogen content of crop stalks is 0.5%) of 85 million jin, equivalent to 2,125,000 tons of ammonium sulfate.

    The above is just an estimate of the three most important organic fertilizers. Even so, it can guarantee a bumper harvest in agricultural production. If various miscellaneous fertilizers are included, then the source of fertilizer is even more "inexhaustible."

  Properties and Effects of Organic Fertilizer

    Organic fertilizers contain various elements needed for crop nutrition, mainly nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The utilization rate of the three elements in human excrement and urine is very high, comparable to chemical fertilizers. In barnyard manure and compost, the utilization rate of phosphorus and potassium is also very high, except that the utilization rate of nitrogen is relatively low. In the first year, the utilization rate of the three elements in barnyard manure and compost can generally reach 20%-30% of the total amount of nitrogen, 30%-40% of phosphorus, and up to 60%-70% of potassium. Human excrement and urine contain a relatively large amount of quick-acting ammoniacal nitrogen, most of the rest is semi-decomposed amino acid nitrogen, and only a small part is complex organic nitrogen. The form of nitrogen in barnyard manure and compost is completely opposite. Therefore, their effect is slow and long-lasting. This is the characteristic of organic fertilizer and the main difference from chemical fertilizer.

    The effect of organic fertilizer depends on the degree of decomposition and rotting: the better the decomposition and rotting, the more quick-acting nutrients there are. Poorly decomposed or rotten barnyard manure or compost needs five or six months or even a year to take effect when applied to the soil.

    The effect of organic fertilizer also depends on the method of composting and preservation. During composting and preservation, special attention should be paid to the loss and volatilization of effective nutrients. Otherwise, the longer the composting and storage time, the more complete the decomposition and rotting, the more effective nutrient loss, and the lower the effect.

    Another characteristic of organic fertilizer is that it contains a large amount of organic matter. In well-decomposed and rotten fertilizers, this organic matter is transformed into humus. Humus is a complex and special compound that has a very close relationship with soil fertility. Humus plays two important roles in the soil: one is to continue to decompose and release the nutrients it contains, directly supplying the nutrition of crops; the other is to indirectly improve the soil structure and physical and chemical properties. Humus can increase the water retention, heat preservation, and fertilizer retention of sandy soil, and can also make heavy clay soil loose, improve ventilation, and strengthen water penetration. The increase and accumulation of humus in the soil is directly related to the application of organic fertilizer, thereby ensuring deep plowing and increased production.

    After organic fertilizer is applied to the soil, continuous decomposition by microorganisms produces a large amount of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a necessary substance for plant assimilation, which is the most basic substance constituting the plant body. Carbon dioxide can be absorbed from the leaf surface or from the plant roots; increasing the supply of carbon dioxide can increase crop production. In the process of decomposition of organic fertilizer in the soil, organic acids can be produced, which is of great significance for the transformation of soil mineral nutrients and the regulation of soil solution reactions.

    Organic fertilizer can be used as an intermediate buffer for soil nutrient supply and plant nutrition. This effect can preserve a large amount of soluble chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers, in the soil without loss. At the same time, it will not affect the concentration of the soil solution due to the addition of a large amount of soluble salts, which is detrimental to plant growth. This buffering effect of preserving fertilizer and regulating soil fertility supply is very important for ensuring high-yield increases in the current situation of large-scale application of chemical fertilizers.

    Application Methods of Organic Fertilizer

    Organic fertilizer is suitable for the application of various crops and various soils. Under normal circumstances, no matter how much is applied, it will not have adverse consequences for soil properties and crop growth. This excellent property is not possessed by any chemical fertilizer. Because organic fertilizer has a slow and long-lasting effect, special attention should be paid to the application time and method. The application of barnyard manure and compost is best used as base fertilizer, but it can also be used as seed fertilizer. Well-rotted organic fertilizer is suitable for use as top dressing. How the application period of organic fertilizer and the fertilizer effect adapt to the needs of each growth stage of crops is a question that must be studied.

    No matter how rotten the organic fertilizer is, it still contains a lot of undecomposed or semi-decomposed organic matter. Organic matter is the best source of energy for microbial life. Even well-rotted fertilizer will inevitably lead to a large number of microorganisms growing and multiplying in the soil in the initial stage of application. When microorganisms grow and multiply, in order to form the protein in their own cells, they will absorb available nitrogen in the soil. Applying organic fertilizer in combination with quick-acting chemical nitrogen fertilizer can fix the excess quick-acting nitrogen so that it will not be lost from the soil. The growth and death of microorganisms are both very fast. In the process of their death, they will transform complex organic nitrogen into available nitrogen, so that crops can often obtain nitrogen nutrition.

    Soluble phosphate fertilizer is easily fixed by soil particles and transformed into insoluble fertilizer when applied to acidic soil, reducing the fertilization effect. Granular superphosphate of lime is not only convenient to apply, but also reduces the surface area in contact with soil particles and improves fertilizer efficiency; applying organic fertilizer in combination with quick-acting phosphate fertilizer can also have the same effect.

    Using organic and inorganic fertilizers in combination can allow various crops to obtain the highest production. This fertilization method not only provides crops with sufficient nutrients in the early stages, but also continues to supply crops with nutrients in the future. But the best fertilization method is to apply organic and inorganic fertilizers in combination, and then apply chemical fertilizer as top dressing during the crop growing season.

    When organic fertilizer is stacked and stored, special attention should be paid to preserving the fertilizer so that effective nutrients are not lost or volatilized. When applying it in the field, attention should also be paid to the loss of nutrients. The main loss of nutrients during this period is available nitrogen. The general application method of soil manure in rural areas of North China is to first pile the fertilizer on the cultivated land, let it be blown by the wind and sun and washed by rain, and then spread it and plow it into the soil. This fertilization method will lose part or all of the quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer. Exposing barnyard manure on the ground for just two days can reduce the yield increase effect by 20%-30%, and after two weeks it can be reduced to half or more than half. The rational application method of organic fertilizer is to plow it into the soil immediately when it is transported to the cultivated land. (Attached table)

    有机肥料
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所
    多施有机肥料是农业
      增产的关键
    肥料中包括有机肥料和无机肥料。有机肥料是农村自给肥料，又叫作农家肥料。无机肥料是自然矿质和工厂制造的肥料，又叫作化学肥料。这两种肥料在性质、肥分含量与施肥效果上有很大的区别。几千年来我国农村中施用的肥料，主要是有机肥料。这种肥料提高了土壤肥力，保证了农业生产。
    有机肥料中包括人粪尿、家畜粪尿（混合耨草叫厩肥）、堆肥（或杂肥）三大类。绿肥、饼肥、骨肥，泥土肥料中的河塘泥、老墙、炕土、道土、院土、熏土等，海肥中鱼虾、海蛤、海螺等不能食用的部分，屠宰场的废物如皮毛蹄角等，都是有机肥料。本文主要谈谈人粪尿、家畜粪尿、堆肥（杂肥）三种有机肥料。
    1958年我国粮食和经济作物产量成倍增加。但是这一年我国的化学肥料生产量，只有八十一万一千吨，按全国十七亿亩农田计算，每亩不足一斤。1958年，施用的肥料主要是有机肥料。每亩耕地由已往的三、两千斤，提高到一万斤、五万斤、十万斤以上，因此得到了空前的丰收。
    有机肥料的最大优点，是肥分的含量多种多样，效果虽较迟缓但能持久。有机肥料中含有大量的有机物质，这种物质在熟化土壤改良土壤性质，保存土壤肥力上，具有最大的优越性。1958年深耕增产的经验证明，多施有机肥料是其重要关键。
      有机肥料的来源
    有机肥料的来源，以人粪尿、家畜粪尿、堆杂肥三种为最多。蔬菜栽培地区，有单独施用人粪尿的习惯；最近两三年中华北各省农村，开始施用尿液使小麦得到增产，一般农村中绝大多数，是应用三种肥料混合制成堆沤肥，例如华北农村中的土粪，南方水田的凼肥。
    人粪尿是一种完全肥料，也是一种速效性肥料。人粪尿中的肥分利用率，相当于化学肥料的效果。我国六亿五千万人，成年人以三亿计算，每年排泄的人粪尿中含有氮素为二十六万四千三百万斤，合一百三十二点一万吨，相当于硫酸铵六百六十点五万吨中氮素的含量。把这一数量的硫酸铵，施用到全国十七亿亩耕地中，每亩可得八斤，这是一个巨大的数字。磷酸的含量为四十点八万吨，相当于二百零四万吨过磷酸钙中磷酸的含量。氧化钾为五十万吨，相当于一百零四万吨硫酸钾中钾的含量。虽不可能使每个人的粪尿全部保存作为肥料，但是如果我们以重视化学肥料的观点来重视它，那么肥分最大效果最速的农家肥料人粪尿，就可大大增加。
    家畜粪尿与人粪尿相似，也是一种肥分完全的肥料，肥分含量（％）一般如下表所列。
    我国大家畜的数量，1958年计划要求的头数是，牛马驴骡的总数要达到八千八百二十七万头，猪达到一万五千万头。按照这个数字估计，家畜粪尿的生产量和肥分含量，同人粪尿一样是一个巨大的肥料来源。
    为了吸收尿液保存肥分，人粪尿中通常混入碎土，家畜粪尿加入耨草作成厩肥，这就大大的增加了肥料的数量，并且保存了肥分。
    人粪尿中含有较多量的肥分和较少量的有机质，最好配合含氮素较少而含有机质量较多的材料，如稿秆、杂草、垃圾等混合堆沤，制成良好的堆肥，这也可以大量的增加有机肥料的数量，开辟肥料的来源。人畜粪含有肠道传染性病虫害菌，直接施用，加速了这些病害的传播。只有通过堆积发酵，才能消灭这些病原体。应用人畜粪便混合稿秆、杂草、垃圾制成堆沤肥，是我国农民多少年来的宝贵经验，是农村中的主要制肥方法。
    稿秆是农作物收获后的残余物，杂草、落叶、垃圾等是农村中的废弃物。目前农村中的作物稿秆，虽然各有其一定的用途，但仍有很大的部分可以应用于制造肥料。稿秆中常为各种农作物病虫害菌寄居的场所，必须经过堆积发酵，除去了病虫害，才能作为肥料。一般稿秆的肥分含量，如下表所列（由于取样不同，分析结果常有差别）：
    稿秆中的肥分含量，以极复杂的有机化合态存在着，不经过分解腐烂，不能为作物所吸收利用。因此，必须混合人粪尿通过堆积发酵，才能作为肥料。一千斤干燥稿秆加入二百至四百斤人粪尿，即可制成二千至二千五百斤良好的堆肥。这种堆肥的肥分含量，可以相当于五千至一万斤普通土粪。全国十七亿亩农田，每亩抽用一百斤稿秆制成肥料，约可得到三点四至四点二五亿斤良好的堆肥，其中含有的氮素（稿秆含氮量平均以0.5％计算），应为八万五千万斤，合硫酸铵二百一十二点五万吨。
    以上只是就三种最主要的有机肥料作估计的。即使如此，也已可保证农业生产得到丰收。如果把各种杂肥计算在内，那末肥源就更是“取之不尽，用之不竭”的了。
  有机肥料的性质和效果
    有机肥料含有作物营养所需要的各种元素，其中以氮、磷、钾为主。人粪尿中三要素的利用率很高，可以比得上化学肥料。厩肥及堆肥中，除氮素的利用率较低外，磷及钾素的利用率也是很高的。在第一年，厩肥及堆肥的三要素利用率，一般氮素可达到总量的20％—30％，磷素30％—40％，钾最高可达到60％—70％。人粪尿中含有较多量的速效性氨态氮素，其余大部分为半分解状态氨基酸态氮素，少部分才为复杂的有机态。厩肥及堆肥中的氮素形态就完全相反，因此它们的效果是缓慢而持久，这是有机肥料的特点，也是与化学肥料的主要不同点。
    有机肥料的效果，决定于它们分解腐烂的程度：分解腐烂愈良好，速效性肥分愈多。分解腐烂不良的厩肥或堆肥，施用到土壤中，需五、六个月甚至一年以后才能发生效果。
    有机肥料的效果，还决定于堆积保存的方法。在堆积保存时，需要特别注意有效肥分的流失和挥发损失。否则堆积贮藏的时间愈长，分解腐烂愈完全，有效肥分的损失愈多，效果就愈低了。
    有机肥料的另一特点是含有多量的有机物质，在分解腐烂良好的肥料中，这种有机物质转变为腐殖质的形态。腐殖质是一种复杂的特殊的化合物，对土壤肥力具有极密切的关系。土壤中腐殖质起着两种重要的作用：一种是继续分解释出内含的肥分，直接供给作物的营养；一种是间接的改良土壤结构和理化性质。腐殖质可使沙土增加保水保温保肥的力量，也可使粘重土壤变为疏松，改良通气状况，加强水分的渗透。土壤中腐殖质的增加和积累，是和有机肥料的施用直接相关的，从而保证了深耕增产。
    有机肥料施用到土壤中后，因为微生物的继续分解，产生多量的二氧化碳。二氧化碳是植物同化作用必需的物质，也就是构成植物机体的最基本物质。二氧化碳可以从叶面吸收，也可由植物根部吸收；增加二氧化碳的供应量，就可增加作物的生产量。有机肥料在土壤内分解的过程中，能产生有机酸，对于土壤矿质养分的转化，和土壤溶液反应的调节，有很重要的意义。
    有机肥料可以作为土壤养分供应与植物营养的一种中间缓冲剂。这种作用，可使施用多量可溶性化学肥料之后，特别是氮素肥料，能够保存在土壤内不至损失。同时也不至因为多量可溶性盐类的加入，影响土壤溶液的浓度，对植物生长发生不利。这种保肥和调节土壤肥分供应的缓冲作用，在目前大量施用化学肥料的情况下，对保证高额增产，有很重要的关系。
    有机肥料的施用方法
    有机肥料适合于各种作物和各种土壤的施用。在一般的情况下，不管施用量的多少，对土壤性质和作物生长，不会产生不良后果，这种优良性质是任何种化学肥料所没有的。有机肥料因为它的效果缓慢而持久，施用时期和方法，需要特别加以注意。厩肥堆沤肥的施用，最好作为基肥，但也可以作为种肥。腐熟良好的有机肥料才适合于用作追肥。有机肥料的施用时期及其发生的肥效，如何适应作物各个生长阶段的需要，是必须研究的一个问题。
    有机肥料不管它的腐熟程度如何，其中还含有很多量的未分解或半分解的有机质。有机质是微生物生活能量的最好来源。即使腐熟良好的肥料，在施用初期，必然会导致土壤微生物的大量生长繁殖。微生物生长繁殖时，为了构成自身细胞中的蛋白质，会吸收土壤中有效性氮素。有机肥料配合速效性化学氮肥施用，可使多余的速效性氮素被固定，不至从土壤中损失。微生物的生长和死亡都是很快的，在它的死亡过程中，又会把复杂的有机态氮素转变为可给态，使作物可以经常得到氮素营养。
    可溶性磷肥施用到酸性土壤中，容易被土粒固定转变为不溶性，降低施肥效果。颗粒状过磷酸钙，不仅施用方便还可减低同土粒接触的表面，提高肥效；有机肥料配合速效磷肥施用，也可起到相同的作用。
    有机肥料和无机肥料配合使用，可使各种作物得到最高的生产量，这样施肥法不仅使作物初期有充足的营养物质，还可在以后继续供给作物养分。但是最良好的施肥方法，是有机无机肥料配合施用后，同时在作物生长季节，再施用化学肥料作为追肥。
    有机肥料在堆积保存的时候，要特别注意保肥，使有效养分不至流失或挥发损失。在田间施用的时候，也要注意肥分的损失，这时期的肥分损失，主要是有效性的氮素。华北农村中土粪的一般施用方法，先把肥料堆放在耕地上面，任其风吹日晒雨水淋涮，然后撒开耕入土内，这种施肥法，会损失速效氮肥的一部或全部。厩肥在地上短短两天的暴露，就可减低增产效果20％—30％，两个星期后减低达到一半或者超过一半。有机肥料的合理施用方法是，在运到耕地时立即翻入土内。（附图表）
