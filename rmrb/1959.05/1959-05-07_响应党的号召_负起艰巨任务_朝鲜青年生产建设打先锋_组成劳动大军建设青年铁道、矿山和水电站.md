Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Dispatch: Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, Korean youth are organizing youth shock brigades in factories and rural areas to spearhead the implementation of the various production and construction tasks proposed by the Labor Party. A youth labor army, composed entirely of young volunteers from all over the country, is developing and constructing the Youth Railway, the Youth Mine, the Youth Hydropower Station, and the Youth Reservoir.

Since the Korean Workers' Party put forward the slogan "Steel and machinery are the kings of industry" and vigorously developed the production of steel and machinery industries, more than 12,000 young people have poured into the steel front since last winter and this spring. They are undertaking the arduous tasks of building blast furnaces, converters, and various rolling mill equipment. Some young people have also gone deep into the mountains of North Hamgyong Province to develop the Heochuan Youth Iron Mine, and will mine 400,000 tons of iron ore for the country this year.

In order to quickly restore the severely damaged coal mines, during the post-war period, Korean youth volunteered to go to the mines, and now young people account for about 60%-70% of the coal miners. Young people from all over the country have also formed a labor army of several thousand people to develop a youth coal mining area in South Pyongan Province with an annual output of 3.5 million tons of coal.

The Songnam Youth Coal Mine, one of the coal mines in this area, used to be a desolate mountain valley infested with tigers and wolves. After 420 young people came here in July 1957, in just over a year, two coal shafts and a small youth city have appeared. The roadways built in the two coal shafts are already 1,700 meters long, and coal will be produced in July this year, with an output of 400,000 tons next year.

The Park Tae-geun integrated tunneling team of this coal mine recently broke the Republic's high-speed tunneling record twice, with a tunneling speed of 104 and 107 meters per month. The young people have also created a high-speed integrated tunneling machine, which can be operated by only four people and can tunnel 600 meters per month.

The Pyeongsan-Jihari Railway is also a gift from the youth to the motherland. This 52-kilometer-long project, with more than 3 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, was basically completed before this year's "May Day" after the brave labor of 7,500 young people in just four months.

In rural areas, young people are taking the lead in fighting for the realization of irrigation, electrification, and mechanization put forward by the Labor Party. Among the 10,000 water conservancy projects built in rural areas last winter and this spring, young people are a strong shock force. They are also actively building the Jiangjie Youth Power Station with a power generation capacity of 230,000 kilowatts, as well as many small power stations in rural areas. According to statistics up to the end of last year, rural youth have built 240 power stations on their own.

　　响应党的号召  负起艰巨任务
    朝鲜青年生产建设打先锋
    组成劳动大军建设青年铁道、矿山和水电站
    新华社平壤电　朝鲜青年在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在工厂、农村纷纷组织青年突击队，为实现劳动党提出的各项生产建设任务而打先锋。完全由各地青年志愿参加组成的青年劳动大军正在开发和建设着青年铁道、青年矿山、青年水电站和青年水库。
    自从朝鲜劳动党提出“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的口号，大力发展钢铁和机械工业生产以来，去冬今春涌入钢铁战线的就有一万二千多名青年。他们担任着建设高炉、转炉和各种轧钢设备的艰巨任务。一部分青年还深入咸镜北道的深山去开发虚川青年铁矿，在今年内就要为国家采出四十万吨铁矿石。
    为了迅速恢复遭受严重破坏的煤矿，战后期间朝鲜青年纷纷自愿走向矿山，现在煤矿工人中青年约占60％—70％。各地青年还组成了一支数千人的劳动大军正在平安南道开发一个年产三百五十万吨煤的青年煤矿区。
    这个煤矿区中的一个煤矿—松南青年煤矿以前是个虎狼出没的荒野山谷，1957年7月有四百二十名青年来到这里以后，仅仅一年多的时间，就已经出现了两个煤井和一个小小的青年城。两个煤井中建设起来的巷道已有一千七百公尺，今年7月将开始出煤，明年的产量就要达到四十万吨。
    这个煤矿的朴泰根综合掘进小组，不久前以每月掘进一百零四和一百零七公尺的速度，两次打破了共和国的高速掘进纪录。青年们还自己创造了一种高速综合掘进机，这种机器只用四个人操纵，每月就可掘进六百公尺。
    平山——支下里铁路，也是青年们向祖国的献礼。这条长五十二公里、土石方达三百多万的工程，经过七千五百个青年的奋勇劳动，仅仅四个月的时间就在今年“五一”前基本上建成。
    在农村中，青年们带头为实现劳动党提出的水利化、电气化、机械化而斗争。在去冬今春农村中兴修的一万项水利工程中，青年们是一支坚强的突击队。他们还正在积极建设着发电能力为二十三万瓩的江界青年发电站，以及农村中的许许多多小型发电站。根据到去年年底为止的统计，农村青年自建的发电站已有二百四十个。
