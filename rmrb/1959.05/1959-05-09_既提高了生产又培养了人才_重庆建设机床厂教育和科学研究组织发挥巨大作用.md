　　Both Improved Production and Cultivated Talent: Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory's Education and Scientific Research Organizations Play a Huge Role
    (Our report) Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory has successively established mass-based scientific and technological research and education networks, forming a three-way combination base throughout the factory that centers on production and where education and scientific and technological research serve production.
    This factory has built a complete mass-based scientific and technological research network. Below the factory-run Scientific and Technological Research Institute, fifteen workshop-level scientific and technological research sub-institutes have been established, ensuring that each district (work area) has research groups, and each group (production team) has scientific and technological researchers. This year, various workshops and departments have also established twenty-two spare-time schools combining political, cultural, and production technology education, along with thirty-nine Party schools and Communist Youth League schools, initially forming a comprehensive education network. In addition to participating in political studies, workers also participate in cultural or technical classes according to their individual needs. Currently, over 90% of the factory's employees are participating in studies. Because the factory's Party committee and workshop Party organizations have made unified arrangements for production, scientific and technological research, and study time, workers, after finishing work each day, either gather in groups to study how to solve key problems in improving production and discuss the realization of innovation projects, or sit in open spaces or empty rooms near the workshop, or go to the factory-run workers' school to study language, arithmetic, philosophy, or mechanical principles, drafting, etc.
    In the past, the Construction Machine Tool Factory produced relatively simple products. In recent years, with the rapid development of national construction, the variety of products has increased to more than one hundred types, and production technology has become increasingly complex. Some products are also sold abroad, requiring workers to master these more complex and newer production technologies, demanding deeper and broader scientific and cultural knowledge. At the same time, as the factory's technical revolution movement deepens, more detailed and in-depth scientific and technological research work is required. All workers urgently need faster and more effective ways to improve their scientific, cultural, and technical levels. Moreover, since the factory implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system, workers encounter many specific problems in participating in management, requiring a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge to do well. In addition, this factory is an old factory, not only responsible for producing products but also for training a large number of technicians and workers every year to support new factories. To enable a large number of new workers to quickly master production technology and scientific culture and replace older workers. These situations indicate the necessity of establishing a mass-based education network to meet the needs of development and employees.
    After the Construction Machine Tool Factory took hold of both the scientific and technological research network and the education network, it tightly linked the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, promoting and driving each other forward. Through these two organizations, workers improved their scientific and cultural knowledge and brought collective wisdom to bear on research and technological innovation, more powerfully promoting the technological revolution and improving production. Workers described the benefits of these two organizations being built as being "like a fast horse growing wings." Tu Gengfu, a technician from the 21st Workshop with a working-class background, has very rich practical experience and often has some innovations. But every time he innovates, he encounters many difficulties: he can't understand the data he needs to find, and he can't figure out how to calculate numbers after the decimal point. After graduating from the spare-time senior elementary class run in the workshop this year, he understood what decimals are, and his calculations are more precise when designing. He can now basically read the data himself. In just two months, he and several workers completed scientific and technological research on five projects, improving product processing methods. Many workers, after participating in scientific and technological research, can more flexibly apply the scientific and technological theoretical knowledge they learned in their studies.

　　既提高了生产又培养了人才
    重庆建设机床厂教育和科学研究组织发挥巨大作用
    本报讯　重庆建设机床厂先后建成群众性的科学技术研究网和教育网，全厂已形成一个以生产为中心的、教育和科学技术研究为生产服务的三结合基地。
    这个工厂已经建成了一套群众性的科学技术研究网。在厂办的科学技术研究院以下，又成立了十五个车间科学技术研究分院，做到了区份（工区）有研究组，组组（生产区组）有科学技术研究员。今年各车间、科室又办起了政治、文化、生产技术教育三结合的业余学校二十二所，党校、团校共三十九所，初步形成一套教育网。工人们除人人参加了政治学习以外，同时还根据本身的需要分别参加了文化班或技术班学习。目前，全厂参加学习的职工已占职工总人数的90％以上。因为工厂党委和车间党组织对生产、科学技术研究和学习的时间作了统一的安排，现在，工人们每天一下班，不是成群成组地在一起研究如何解决提高生产关键问题、讨论革新项目的实现，就是坐在车间附近的空地里、空房里或到厂办的职工学校学习语文、算术、学习哲学或机械原理、制图学……等等。
    建设机床厂过去生产的产品比较单一，最近几年来，国家建设迅速发展，产品品种增加到一百多种，生产技术越来越复杂；有些产品还要运销国外；所以，要求工人掌握这些更复杂的、更新的生产技术，科学文化知识也就要求越深越广。同时，由于厂里技术革命运动开展得越来越深入，对科学技术研究工作要求也就更细致、更深入，所有的工人都迫切地要求用更迅速、更有效的办法来提高科学文化和技术水平。同时，工厂实行“两参一改三结合”以后，工人参加管理工作中遇到许多具体问题，都需要具有一定的科学文化知识水平，才能做得好。另外，这个工厂是老厂，不仅只是要担负生产产品的任务，而且每年都要培养大批技术人员和工人去支援新厂。要使大量的新工人迅速掌握生产技术和科学文化，代替老工人。这些情况说明，必需建立群众性的教育网，以满足形势的发展和职工们的需要。
    建设机床厂把科学技术研究网和教育网两套组织都抓起来以后，把文化革命和技术革命紧紧地捏成了一股绳，互相促进、互相推动。通过这两套组织，工人们提高了科学文化知识，又发挥了集体的智慧来研究和革新技术，更有力地推动了技术革命和提高了生产。工人们形容这两套组织建成以后的好处说：就像快马长了翅膀一样。二十一车间老工人出身的技师屠耕福，实际经验十分丰富，经常都有些革新。但是每次革新，他都要遇到许多困难，要找资料看不懂，要计算小数点以下的数目就弄不清……，今年他在车间办的业余高小班学习毕业以后，懂得了小数是什么，设计时计算就更精密了，资料也基本上自己会看了，短短两个月内，就和几个工人一道完成了五个项目的科学技术研究，改进了产品的加工方法。许多工人在参加科学技术研究以后，更能灵活运用在学习中得来的科学技术理论知识。
