    Improved Tools Will Show Their Skills in the Summer Harvest
    Bengbu Special District's Summer Harvest Crops Can Be Reaped and Threshed in Seven Days

    Hefei, May 23rd (from this newspaper) - Bengbu Special District, Anhui Province, has comprehensively innovated and promptly manufactured and promoted a large number of new-style harvesting, transporting, and threshing tools for the summer harvest. This will enable the entire special district's 15 million mu of summer harvest crops to be basically reaped and threshed within seven days, and labor efficiency will be doubled compared to last year.

    The Bengbu Special District has rushed to produce nearly four million new-style summer harvest tools of various types. The main ones include more than 600,000 improved sickles, about 2,000 simple harvesters and quick harvesters, more than 50,000 large swing knives, more than 146,000 vehicles of various types, more than 1,000 wooden boats, and more than 16,000 improved stone rollers. Due to their high work efficiency, these new-style summer harvest tools can enable the basic reaping and threshing of 15 million mu of summer harvest crops within seven days. In terms of harvesting, the newly-made simple harvester promoted in this special district can harvest more than 20 mu per day, equivalent to the total harvest of 16 people using old-style sickles in one day, increasing work efficiency by eight times. The newly-made large swing knife can harvest 5 mu per day, which is two times faster than using old-style sickles manually. The newly-made quick harvester can harvest 3 mu per day, increasing work efficiency by one time compared to using old-style sickles manually. Changing the original old-style sickle from short to long, and from a single blade to multiple blades, can increase work efficiency by 10%. After all these newly-made and modified summer harvest tools are put into use, they can save a total of more than 2.6 million workdays in seven days, accounting for more than 80% of the total summer harvest workdays needed. In addition, by mobilizing organizations, troops, schools, and urban personnel to support the summer harvest, the summer harvest crops can be basically reaped within seven days. In terms of transportation, the newly-made and modified vehicles and boats have a total daily transportation loading capacity of more than 200 million jin in the entire special district, an increase of 50% compared to last year, basically achieving the goal of reaping and transporting simultaneously within seven days. In terms of threshing, the work efficiency of all modified and newly-made improved stone rollers, small winnowing machines, and threshing forks is generally doubled compared to before. The newly-made threshing machine can also thresh indoors without being restricted by cloudy and rainy weather, which can also greatly shorten the threshing time.

    The CPC Bengbu Prefectural Committee is organizing Party committees at all levels to conduct a large-scale quality inspection of the various newly-made summer harvest tools that have been manufactured, and is also combining the harvesting of early-maturing crops with the training of technical personnel to ensure that the entire special district's 15 million mu of summer harvest crops are basically reaped and threshed completely within seven days, without delaying the summer planting.

    改良工具将在夏收中大显身手
    蚌埠专区夏收作物七天内可以收打完毕
    本报合肥23日电　安徽省蚌埠专区全面革新并及时制造推广大批收割、运输和脱粒的夏收新式工具，使全专区一千五百万亩夏收作物可在七天中基本收打完毕，劳动效率将比去年提高一倍。
    蚌埠专区已经赶制了各种夏收新式工具近四百万件，其中主要的有改良镰刀六十多万把，简易收割机和快速收割器约二千部，大鐥刀五万多把，各种车辆十四万六千多部，木船一千多只，改良石滚一万六千多条。这些新式夏收工具由于工效高，可以使一千五百万亩夏收作物在七天中基本收打完毕。在收割上，这个专区推广的新制简易收割机，每部每天可收割二十亩以上，等于十六人用旧式镰刀一天收割的总和，工效提高八倍。新制的大鐥刀，每把每天可收五亩，较人工用旧式镰刀快两倍。新制快速收割器每天每把可收三亩，较人工用旧式镰刀提高工效一倍。将原来的旧式镰刀，由短改长，由一页刃改为多页刃可提高工效10％。所有这些新制和改制的夏收工具投入使用后，在七天中共可节省工作日二百六十多万个，占所缺夏收工作日总额80％以上，再加上动员机关、部队、学校，城镇人员支援夏收，就可在七天内基本收完夏收作物。在运输上，新制和改制的各种车辆和船只，全专区每天运输装载量达二亿斤以上，比去年提高50％，在七天内基本上做到收一块运一块。在脱粒上，所有改制和新制的各种改良石滚，小型扬场机和跑场杈，工效一般都比以前提高一倍上下。新制的脱粒机还可不受阴雨限制在室内进行脱粒，也可大大缩短脱粒时间。
    中共蚌埠地委正组织各级党委对已制成的各种夏收新式工具进行质量大检查，并结合收割早熟作物培训技术力量，以保证在七天内基本收打完全专区一千五百万亩夏收作物，不误夏种。
