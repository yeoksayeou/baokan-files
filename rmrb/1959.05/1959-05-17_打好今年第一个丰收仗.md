Fight Well the First Bumper Harvest Battle of the Year

The summer harvest is about to begin in full swing, and this is an extremely important and arduous battle.

The national summer harvest grain crop area accounts for about a quarter of the total annual grain crop area; adding early rice, it accounts for more than one-third. The area of rapeseed also accounts for about one-third of the total oil crop area. Achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops is of great significance for achieving the annual grain and oil production targets. Moreover, a bumper harvest of summer crops will have an inestimable promoting effect on the whole year's agricultural production, industrial production, and cultural construction. A bumper harvest of summer crops can promote a bumper harvest of autumn crops; a bumper harvest in agricultural production can promote a "bumper harvest" in industry, commerce, and cultural education. This was the case last year, and it will be the case this year.

As the saying goes, "Harvesting wheat is like snatching food from a dragon's mouth." This means that harvesting wheat is very urgent. Because the best time to harvest wheat is during the waxy ripe stage (fully mature stage), and the waxy ripe stage is only five to eight days. After this period, the wheat stalks become dry and easily shed grains. Therefore, once wheat enters the waxy ripe stage, it must be harvested immediately. According to past survey data: delaying the harvest by five days will reduce production by about 4%; delaying it by ten days will reduce production by about 20%. The longer the delay, the greater the reduction in production. During the same period, it is also necessary to do three tasks: summer harvest, summer planting, and field management of early rice and cotton. This makes the arrangement of agricultural labor even more tense. Recently, the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi calculated a labor account: this area has a total of 15.8 million mu of wheat. Calculated at three workdays per mu of wheat for harvesting, threshing, and storage, a total of 47.4 million workdays are required. In addition, more than 4.4 million mu of summer coarse grains need to be harvested, more than 7 million mu of summer crops need to be planted, and more than 4.3 million mu of cotton fields need to be managed, requiring a total of more than 60 million workdays. However, this area has a total labor force of 3.71 million, of which 80% is used for agriculture, with a daily attendance of 2.97 million people. In the fifteen days of summer harvest and summer planting, 44.55 million workdays can be provided, still lacking more than 16.4 million workdays, or 27% of the labor force. This example represents the general situation of labor shortage during the summer harvest season in wheat-producing areas this year. This situation shows that the key to fighting well the first bumper harvest battle of the year is to greatly strengthen organizational leadership, seize the opportunity, and effectively adjust and organize the rural labor force.

We firmly believe that after the rectification of the people's communes, the labor organization and management system are more complete than before; the vast number of cadres and members also have the experience and lessons of last year's bumper harvest, especially the high production enthusiasm of the vast number of members. On this basis, as long as the organizational leadership work is done well, it is entirely possible to successfully complete the summer campaign on the agricultural front. Organizational leadership often ultimately determines the success or failure of a matter. Leading the summer harvest, although not as complicated as war, is not simple either. Taking the varieties of summer crops as an example, different varieties have different characteristics, and the maturity and harvest period varies. Looking at the climate conditions, the climate varies from east to west and south to north in a province, and there are also differences between the south and north, east and west of a larger county. Different climates mean different maturity and harvest periods. Therefore, to lead the summer harvest well, it is necessary to specifically analyze and grasp all aspects of the situation, and organize forces and arrange work according to the situation, just like a military commander.

Another issue of organizational leadership is to properly arrange labor and solve the problem of labor shortage. There are two methods here: one is to rationally arrange the existing labor force; the other is to reform tools and improve labor efficiency. The first question in arranging labor is whether to concentrate forces to make a rush for the summer harvest, or to disperse forces to advance simultaneously in summer harvest, summer planting, and field management of early rice and cotton, etc.? There must be a correct understanding of this question. Although summer harvest, summer planting, and field management are all important, there are still primary and secondary tasks in each stage. In the few days when summer crops are fully mature, summer harvest is the primary task. This is not only because wheat must be harvested quickly after it is ripe, but also because land can only be freed up for summer planting after the summer harvest; and only after the wheat is harvested can the vast number of members be encouraged to do a good job in summer planting and field management of early rice and cotton. However, concentrating forces on summer harvest does not mean that a small part of the force should not also be allocated to take care of summer planting and field management during these few days. In particular, for summer planting, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of harvesting one piece and planting one piece, planting the land as soon as possible, and gradually shifting the force to summer planting and field management as the summer harvest and summer planting work is gradually completed. From now on, the people's communes in the wheat-producing areas should concentrate their forces on agricultural production, and all commune-run industries and water conservancy and transportation projects that can be temporarily suspended should be suspended immediately.

Since forces can be used in a concentrated way, can the method of "large-scale corps operations" be used? Of course. During last year's autumn harvest, large-scale corps operations played a great role. Naturally, in last year's "large-scale corps operations," there were also serious waste phenomena due to incomplete harvesting. However, this is not a problem of the method itself. One of the important reasons why some shortcomings occurred in the implementation of "large-scale corps operations" in last year's autumn harvest was that many people's communes did not adhere to the principle of distribution according to work in "large-scale corps operations." Another reason is that in "large-scale corps operations," a strict responsibility system was not established, and the fine and rough harvesting, the good and bad harvesting, were all treated the same, which naturally dampened the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of some members. This shows that as long as the principle of distribution according to work is adhered to, and as long as there is a corresponding responsibility system, "large-scale corps operations" is still a feasible temporary assault method.

To adopt "large-scale corps operations," it is necessary to promote large-scale cooperation. For such large-scale agricultural production activities, large-scale cooperation is very necessary. Of course, the large-scale cooperation between people's communes and production teams in rural areas should adopt the method of payment according to work or mutual aid and exchange of labor.

The support of troops, organs, schools, and urban residents is also a kind of cooperation—one of the relationships of urban-rural cooperation. This support is not only of great economic significance, but also of great political significance. This year, it is still necessary to continue to carry forward this glorious tradition, and in the tense season of summer harvest, call on and mobilize troops, organs, schools, and urban residents to go to the countryside to help with the summer harvest.

In addition, there should also be cooperation between relevant departments. The agricultural department should do a good job in organizing and arranging labor and arranging technical measures for harvesting; the commercial department should do a good job in supplying summer harvest tools and other materials and equipment and living materials; the grain department should do a good job in requisitioning, transferring, storing, and storing grain; the transportation department should do a good job in transporting grain and other materials and equipment; and the meteorological department should do a good job in weather forecasting. All departments must work together to successfully complete the summer harvest task.

While mobilizing and arranging labor, it is also necessary to prepare various tools for the summer harvest. Now, various places have begun to prepare summer harvest tools, but in a few places, either only attention is paid to reforming and popularizing new tools, or only attention is paid to repairing old tools. These practices are worth discussing. If it is thought that most people are accustomed to using old tools, and therefore, new tools are no longer created and promoted, this is not right. Although new tools are more difficult to manufacture and promote, their labor efficiency is after all several times higher, or even dozens or hundreds of times higher, than old tools. Currently, labor is very tight, and after new tools are promoted, the labor shortage can be alleviated to some extent. Of course, if it is thought that the use of new tools is much more efficient, and there is no need to repair old agricultural tools, this is also not right. From the current situation, it is not possible to manufacture so many improved and new tools all at once, and old tools still account for a considerable proportion, and most people are still accustomed to using old agricultural tools. If tools are not prepared for this majority, it will obviously affect the progress of the entire summer harvest work. The policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, proposed by many places is correct.

Now, there are still half a month or two or thirty days before the summer harvest. The leading comrades at all levels in the main wheat-producing areas should immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of the various preparations for the summer harvest (including ideological preparations and organizational preparations). See if it is possible to successfully complete the summer harvest task without losing a moment or a grain based on the current preparation situation. If not, remedial measures should be taken quickly to catch up. We firmly believe that as long as the first secretaries of the county party committees take command, widely mobilize the masses, give play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, and work together under the united efforts of the whole party and the whole people, we will definitely be able to complete this year's summer harvest task quickly and well.

### 打好今年第一个丰收仗

    打好今年第一个丰收仗
    夏收即将全面展开了，这是一场极为重要极为艰巨的战斗。
    全国夏收粮食作物面积，约占全年粮食作物总面积的四分之一左右；加上早稻则为三分之一强。油菜的面积，也占油料作物总面积的三分之一左右。取得夏收作物的大丰收，对于实现全年粮食和油料生产的指标，都有巨大的意义。而且，夏收作物的大丰收，对全年农业生产和工业生产、文化建设等方面，又有着不可估量的推动作用。夏收作物大丰收，可以促进秋收作物大丰收；农业生产大丰收，可以促进工业、商业和文化教育事业“大丰收”。去年如此，今年也将是如此。
    农谚说：“麦收一晌，龙口夺食”。这就是说，收割麦子是非常紧张的。因为麦子最适宜的收获时间是在腊熟期
  （完全成熟期），而腊熟期只有五天到八天。过了这个时期，麦株干枯，容易脱粒。因此，麦子进入腊熟期以后，就要立即收回来。据过去的调查资料：收获迟延五天，就要减产4％左右；迟延十天，减产20％左右。迟延的时间愈长，减产的数字愈大。而在这同一个时间内，还要做好夏收、夏种和早稻、棉花田间管理三项工作。这就使得农业劳动力的安排更加紧张了。最近陕西关中地区算了一笔劳动力账：这个区共有一千五百八十万亩小麦，按一亩小麦的收、打、入仓用三个工计算，共需工四千七百四十万个，再加上四百四十多万亩夏杂粮的收获和七百多万亩的夏种任务以及四百三十余万亩的棉田管理，共需工六千余万个。而这个区共有劳动力三百七十一万个，以其中80％用于农业，每日出勤二百九十七万人，在夏收夏种的十五天当中，可出工四千四百五十五万个，尚缺一千六百四十多万个工，即27％的劳动力。这个例子代表今年产麦区夏收季节劳动力紧张的一般情况。这种情况说明，打好今年第一个丰收仗的关键，就是要大大地加强组织领导，抓紧时机，很好的调整和组织农村劳动力。
    我们深信，人民公社经过整顿以后，劳动组织和经营管理制度比以前更加完善了；广大干部和社员也有了去年大丰收的经验和教训，特别是广大社员的生产热情高涨。在这个基础上，只要组织领导工作作得好，是完全可以胜利完成农业战线上夏季战役的。组织领导，常常最后决定着一件事情的成功和失败。领导夏收，虽然没有战争那样复杂；但是也不简单。以夏收作物的品种来说，品种不同，特点不同，成熟收获期的早晚也就不同。再看气候情况，一个省的东南西北气候有所不同，就是较大的县的南边和北边，东边和西边，也都有差别。气候不同，成熟收获时期也就不同。因此，要领导好夏收，必须像部队的指挥官一样，具体分析和掌握各方面情况，根据情况组织力量，安排工作。
    组织领导的另一个问题，是妥善安排劳力，解决劳动力紧张的问题。这里有两个方法，一个是合理地安排现有的劳动力；另一个是改革工具，提高劳动效率。安排劳力中的第一个问题，是集中力量突击夏收呢，还是分散力量对夏收、夏种和早稻、棉花等田间管理都齐头并进呢？对这个问题必须有正确的认识。夏收、夏种和田间管理工作，虽然都很重要，但在各个阶段上，仍有主次之分。在夏收作物完全成熟的几天内，夏收工作就是主要的。这不仅仅因为麦子熟了以后必须赶快收获，而且只有在夏收之后，才可以腾出地来夏种；也只有把麦子收到手了，才可以鼓舞广大社员做好夏种和早稻、棉花的田间管理。但是，集中力量进行夏收，并不是说就不应当在这几天之内也分出一小部分力量去照顾夏种和田间管理工作。特别是夏种，一定要坚持收一块、种一块的原则，尽快地把地种上，并且随着夏收、夏种工作的逐步完成，要逐渐把力量转移到夏种和田间管理上。从现在开始，产麦区的人民公社就要把力量集中到农业生产上，一切可以暂时停办的社办工业和修建的水利、交通工程等，都应当立即停办。
    既然可以集中使用力量，那么可以不可以运用“大兵团作战”的方法呢？当然可以。在去年秋收中间，大兵团作战是起了很大的作用的。自然，去年的“大兵团作战”中，也曾发生过收获不细致的严重的浪费现象。但是，这不是方法本身的问题。去年秋收中实行“大兵团作战”之所以产生一些缺点，重要原因之一是有许多人民公社在“大兵团作战”中，没有坚持按劳分配的原则。另一个原因是在“大兵团作战”中，没有建立严格的责任制，收的细和粗，收的好和坏，都一律看待，这自然挫伤了一部分社员的积极性和责任心。这就说明了，只要坚持按劳分配原则，只要有相适应的责任制，“大兵团作战”还是一种可行的临时突击的方法。
    要采用“大兵团作战”，就要提倡大协作。像这样规模巨大的农业生产活动，大协作是很需要的。当然，农村中各人民公社之间和各生产队之间的大协作，应该采用按劳计酬或互助换工的办法。
    部队、机关、学校和城市居民的支援，也是一种协作——即城乡协作的关系之一。这种支援，不仅有经济上的重要意义，也有政治上的重要意义。今年，仍需继续发挥这种光荣传统，在夏收紧张的季节，号召和动员部队、机关、学校和城市居民，到农村去，帮助夏收。
    此外，有关部门之间也要进行协作。农业部门要做好劳动力的组织安排和收割上的技术措施安排；商业部门要做好夏收工具及其他物资器材和生活资料的供应工作；粮食部门要做好征购、调运、保管、贮藏工作；交通部门要做好粮食和其他物资器材的运输工作；气象部门要做好气象预报工作。各部门都要通力合作，才能胜利地完成夏收任务。
    在动员安排劳动力的同时，还必须准备好夏收的各种工具。现在各地都已开始准备夏收工具，但是有少数地方或者只注意改革和推广新式工具，或者只注意添修旧式工具。这些作法是值得商讨的。如果以为大多数群众习惯于使用旧式工具，因此，就不再创造和推广新式工具，这是不对的。新式工具虽然制造和推广都比较困难，但是劳动效率毕竟比旧式工具高几倍，甚至十几倍或几十倍。目前劳动力很紧张，推广新式工具以后，就可以缓和一部分劳动力的紧张。当然，如果以为使用新式工具效率高得多，就不必再添修旧式农具，这也是不对的。从目前情况来看，改良的和新式工具，一下子制造不出那样多，旧式工具还占相当大的比重，习惯于使用旧式农具的人还是大多数，如果不给这大多数人准备好工具，显然要影响整个夏收工作的进行。不少地方提出土洋并举、以土为主的方针是正确的。
    现在，离夏收还有半月或二、三十天时间了，主要产麦区的各级领导同志，应该立即对夏收的各项准备工作（包括思想准备、组织准备）作一次深入的检查。看一看按照现在的准备情形，是否可能做到一刻不让、一颗不丢地胜利地完成夏收任务。如果不能的话，就应当赶快采用补救办法，迎头赶上。我们深信，只要各县党委第一书记挂帅，广泛地动员群众，发挥群众的干劲和智慧，在全党全民一致努力之下，一定能够把今年的夏收任务完成得又快又好。
