    Making People's Lives Better

    Establishing Life Service Factories
    Not long ago, a life service united factory opened in Moscow. It can truly be called an all-purpose factory, undertaking the making of new clothes, altering old clothes, laundry, repairing shoes, radios, clocks, televisions... and the work is done quickly with reasonable charges.
    Moscow residents have praised the life service united factory. In the last two months alone, the factory has served as many as 120,000 customers. This type of factory especially solves significant problems for housewives. For example, Ivanova, a female worker at a textile factory near the factory, said, "My husband and I work every day, and my son goes to school. In the past, I had to wash, iron, and mend after getting off work every day. There were so many chores. Since this factory opened next door, I don't have to worry anymore. When I go to work in the morning, I can drop off the things that need to be repaired or washed, and when I come back in the evening, the shirts are clean and neatly ironed. It's really convenient and cheap."
    This factory is constantly expanding its business. Recently, it opened a rental department where residents can rent sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, electric irons, and other household items for short periods. In the future, it is also planned to establish a residential household service department, where factory staff will personally go to residents' homes to take orders and deliver the finished products.

  Building a Five-Story Building with Plastics
    A plastic high-rise building with sixty apartments is being built in the Izmailovo district of Moscow. This building will be completed soon.
    Building a five-story building with plastic is a first in the Soviet Union. Apart from the foundations and main structure, everything such as roofs, walls, floors, ceilings, water pipes, and waterproofing equipment will be made of plastic. Plastic houses are very beautiful. The floors shine without waxing, and the walls without wallpaper or paint show beautiful patterns. The ceilings are equally radiant. Window sashes, tables, chairs, carpets, fans, washbasins, cornices, and wainscoting are all made of beautiful plastic. Plastic buildings are indeed wonderful, but there is only one thing: you cannot nail anything to the walls. Each relocating resident will receive plastic hooks and special glue when they receive their relocation certificate.
    It is estimated that plastic houses are four to five times lighter than ordinary brick houses, and because plastic is unbreakable and unwrinkled, it is stronger than brick houses. The construction of plastic houses is very simple. The largest building component weighs only 350 kilograms, and the wainscoting weighs no more than 140 kilograms. This kind of wall panel hardly transmits heat. Its thermal conductivity is 92% lower than that of brick.
    The results of the tests show that the external strength of plastic is not inferior to alloy steel, and the honeycomb layer inside the wall—the filler—can withstand greater pressure than brick and concrete, and also has good sound insulation and other properties.
    The manufacture of honeycomb walls is a new achievement of the Plastic Research Institute, and there is an interesting story behind it. During his visit to China, the chief engineer of the Plastic Research Institute, Pishekhonov, visited a children's toy factory, where he saw many toys made of honeycomb materials, which were quite strong. After Pishekhonov returned to China, he and his colleagues designed a simple machine that "molded" architectural honeycombs in the same way that China made toys. (Attached picture)

    让人民生活更美好
    建立生活服务工厂
    不久以前，在莫斯科开设了一个生活服务联合工厂。这真可以称作是一种万能工厂，厂里承制新装、翻改旧衣、洗衣，修理鞋、收音机、钟表、电视机……而且活做得很快，收费也相当少。
    莫斯科居民对生活服务联合工厂赞不绝口，仅在最近两个月内，这个厂的顾客竟达十二万人。这种工厂特别给家庭主妇解决了很大的问题。例如，工厂附近的一个纺织厂的女工伊万诺娃说：“我和我的丈夫天天上班工作，儿子上学，过去每天下班回来还要洗、熨、补，家务事真多。自从隔壁有了这个工厂，我可不用操心了。早晨上班时，顺路把要修要洗的东西带去，晚上回来一看，衬衣洗得干干净净，熨得平平的。真是又方便，又便宜。”
    这个工厂还在不断扩大自己的业务，最近又开设了一个出租部，居民可以从那里短期租用缝纫机、吸尘器、电熨斗等家庭用品。将来，还准备成立居民家庭服务部，厂里工作人员将亲自到居民家里去接受订货，做好以后再亲自送上门。
  用塑料建造五层楼
    在莫斯科伊兹玛依洛沃区正在建造一座有六十套住宅的塑料高楼，这幢楼房不久即可完工。
    用塑料建筑五层楼，在苏联还是第一次。除了基础和主要结构外，像屋顶、墙壁、地板、天花板、水管和防水设备等一切都要用塑料。塑料房屋非常美观，地板不用打蜡便闪闪发光，没有裱糊和油漆的墙壁呈现出美丽的花纹，天花板也同样发出光彩。窗扇、桌子、椅子、地毯、风扇、洗脸池、檐板和护墙板等都是用漂亮的塑料作的。塑料楼房的确很妙，但只有一样：不能往墙上钉钉子。每个迁居者在拿到迁居证的时候将会领到塑料钩子和特制的浆糊。
    据估计，塑料房子要比一般砖房轻四、五倍，而且因为塑料具有不碎、不皱的特点，所以比砖房结实。塑料房子的建筑工程十分简便，最大的建筑部件只有三百五十公斤，护墙板重量不超过一百四十公斤。这种墙板几乎不传热，它的导热率比砖要小92％。
    试验的结果表明，塑料外部的坚固性不亚于合金钢，墙壁内部的填充物——蜂窝层比砖和混凝土能承受更大的压力，而且具有隔音等良好性能。
    制造蜂窝墙是塑料研究所的一项新成就，这里面还有一段有趣的历史。塑料研究所的总工程师彼舍霍诺夫在访问中国期间，参观了儿童玩具制造厂，他看到很多玩具都是用蜂窝状的材料做的，相当坚固。彼舍霍诺夫回国后就同其他同志一道设计成一种简单的机器，按着中国制造玩具的模样“塑造”成建筑上的蜂窝体。（附图片）
