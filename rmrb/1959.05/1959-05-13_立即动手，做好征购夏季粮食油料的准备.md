    Immediately Take Action to Prepare for the Summer Grain and Oil Procurement

    The summer harvest season is just around the corner, and the work of purchasing summer grain and oil crops is about to begin. After the struggle of last winter and this spring, the summer crops in most parts of the country are growing well. If no major natural disasters occur in the next month, a good harvest will certainly be obtained. The vast number of farmers in the summer harvest areas are strengthening the late-stage field management with joy and welcoming the first summer harvest since the communization of the people's communes. At present, all preparations must be made for the purchasing work to meet the farmers' demands for selling summer grain and oil and to ensure the completion of the state purchasing tasks.
    Summer crops, including wheat, barley, naked barley, broad beans, peas, rapeseed, and early rice, are the earliest maturing crops of the year. They are particularly closely related to the economic life of the farmers in the summer harvest areas. In order to strive for a greater autumn harvest, the vast number of farmers in these areas need to increase more means of production than in previous years, need to carry out various agricultural capital construction projects and develop sideline production; at the same time, the people's communes also need to issue wages in a timely manner so that the commune members can arrange their lives, and so on. Therefore, after the summer harvest, the people's communes urgently demand to sell grain and oil to the state in exchange for the various necessary means of production and means of livelihood mentioned above, so as to make arrangements for production and life in the summer and autumn seasons. On the other hand, before the autumn grain comes on the market, wheat is the main food grain for the people in many areas. The state's control of sufficient grain and oil in the summer harvest season is of great significance for ensuring the supply of grain and oil to urban and rural areas before the autumn grain comes on the market, and for the adjustment of flour supply and grain varieties in the coming year.
    How can we successfully complete the task of purchasing and selling summer grain and oil? According to past experience, we must resolutely implement the principle of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick purchasing, and quick transportation. First of all, the harvesting work must be done in a timely manner. In the case of a good grain harvest, some people may have the idea that it doesn't matter if a little grain is scattered, as it won't affect the overall yield anyway. Therefore, the harvesting work is not meticulous enough. This idea and practice are very harmful. Careless harvesting is by no means a small matter that "doesn't matter," but a very important matter that deserves attention. Last autumn, due to the rough harvest, Changzhi, Yanbei, Xinxian, Yuci and other areas in Shanxi Province had to re-harvest, and as a result, they picked up 120 million jin of grain from the fields. The Hongqi and Hongguang and other four people's communes in Xianyang, Shaanxi also picked up 450,000 jin of grain from the already harvested land, an average increase of more than 100,000 jin of grain per commune. Since the harvesting work is related to the actual harvest volume of grain and to the immediate economic interests of the communes and commune members, the vast number of commune members and cadres should take this work seriously; harvesting and threshing should be done quickly and meticulously. We must never allow the grain obtained through hard work to be scattered or discarded in the fields or threshing grounds, resulting in a loss. As long as the vast number of commune members recognize the importance of harvesting work and take effective measures, they will certainly be able to bring every grain home and harvest all the fruits of their hard work.
    On the basis of doing a good job in harvesting, the people's communes should actively and rapidly sell grain and oil to the state to support urban and industrial construction. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, urban industrial production has developed rapidly. Last year, urban industrial departments provided various means of production and other daily industrial products to the vast rural areas, which strongly supported the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. However, with the rapid development of industrial production and capital construction, the urban population has also increased rapidly, and the need for grain and oil consumption has increased accordingly. They need support from the countryside, which is very natural. Now the people's communes sell grain and oil to the state in accordance with the requirements of the state plan, which is a strong support for urban and industrial construction, and also promotes the spirit of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas.
    Wheat and oil crops have relatively high economic value, and farmers have always sold most of their harvests as commodities. The funds obtained from selling wheat and oil crops have always been an important source of income for farmers. Selling wheat and oil crops to the state soon after the harvest is not only conducive to ensuring the state's needs in terms of market supply and industrial raw materials, but also facilitates the communes to arrange the lives of the commune members as early as possible, which is very beneficial to the consolidation and development of the people's communes. If the grain and oil that should be sold to the state are kept for later sale, it is actually equivalent to hoarding funds, which is detrimental to the production of the communes and the lives of the commune members.
    After the summer grain harvest, the people's communes should still adhere to the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, eat sparingly, and pay public grain and sell surplus grain to the state in accordance with the state's purchase plan. Although the amount of summer grain purchased by the state this year is slightly higher than in previous years, the proportion of the purchase figure to agricultural output has decreased compared with previous years due to the rapid increase in agricultural production. That is to say, the proportion of grain retained by the people's communes to agricultural output has increased relatively. Therefore, it is entirely possible to complete the summer grain purchase plan, and it will not affect the farmers' consumption and use of grain. The problem now is to carry out propaganda to the farmers, telling them that even in the case of a bumper harvest, it is still necessary to implement planned consumption and pay attention to saving grain. On the issue of grain, we must look ahead and behind, thinking of possible poor harvests in times of bumper harvests, and thinking of next year this year. Last year, due to the great leap forward in agricultural production, the vast number of commune members increased their grain consumption compared with the past. However, it must also be seen that my country has a large population and a large amount of grain consumption. For example, if each person eats one or two more grains of grain a day, it is simply insignificant for one person, but if calculated on the basis of the country's 600 million people, it will consume 1.8 billion jin of grain more in a month, and 21.6 billion jin in a year. If this amount of grain is in the hands of the state, it can be used to do many things. Therefore, planned use of grain and saving grain are very important.
    Since last winter and this spring, many people's communes have made good achievements in planned grain use. For example, the 32 public canteens of the Wuhua People's Commune in Luocheng County, Guangxi, should have consumed a total of 1.75 million jin of grain in the second half of last year according to the "three fixed" ration standard, but because they conscientiously used grain according to the plan and continuously improved the canteen management, the commune members not only ate enough and well, but also saved more than 390,000 jin of grain in the settlement. There are many similar situations in various places. As long as the people's communes in various places conscientiously sum up their experience and continue to work hard on the basis of the achievements they have already made, they can make greater achievements in planned grain use.
    The grain, finance, commerce, transportation and other relevant business departments bear heavy tasks in completing the summer grain purchase work. Under the unified leadership of the local party committee, they should closely integrate the work of their departments with the entire purchase work, so as to ensure that one link is linked to another, seize the opportunity, and accomplish it in one go. At present, in addition to doing a good job in calculation and evaluation, the relevant departments should also do a good job in the organizational preparation for the purchase, and take practical measures from the perspective of caring for the masses and making it convenient for the masses everywhere, so as to facilitate the commune members to sell summer grain and save their time. It is also necessary to do a good job in the transfer of commodities, so that the commune members can promptly buy back various daily necessities after selling grain. In order to organize the collection and storage of summer grain, it is also necessary to arrange in advance the available manpower, livestock and vehicles, so as to transport the purchased grain to the traffic lines in a timely manner. The more fully these tasks are prepared, the better it will be able to implement the central government's instructions of "quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick purchasing, and quick transportation," so as to successfully complete this year's summer grain and oil purchase tasks.

### 立即动手，做好征购夏季粮食油料的准备

    立即动手，做好征购夏季粮食油料的准备
    夏收季节转眼就要到来了，收购夏粮和油料的工作也快要开始了。经过去冬今春的一番奋斗，目前全国大部分地区的夏收作物生长良好。在今后一个月内，只要不发生重大的自然灾害，肯定将会得到良好的收成。夏收地区的广大农民正以欣喜的心情加强后期田间管理，迎接人民公社化以后的第一个夏季丰收。目前，收购工作必须做好一切准备，才能适应农民出售夏粮和油料的要求，保证国家收购任务的完成。
    夏收作物，包括小麦、大麦、元麦、蚕豆、豌豆、油菜、早稻，是一年中成熟较早的作物。它和夏收地区农民的经济生活关系特别密切。这些地区广大农民为了争取秋季更大的丰收，需要增加比往年更多的生产资料，需要进行各种农业基本建设和发展副业生产；同时，人民公社还需要及时发放工资，让社员群众安排好生活等等。因此，在夏收以后，人民公社迫切要求把粮食油料卖给国家，以换回上述各种必需的生产资料和生活资料，为夏、秋两季的生产和生活做好安排。另一方面，在秋粮登场以前，小麦又是许多地区人民的主要口粮，国家在夏收季节掌握足够的粮食和油料，对于保证秋粮登场以前的城乡粮食供应和油脂供应，对于今后一年中面粉供应和粮食品种的调剂也具有重要的意义。
    怎样才能很好地完成夏季粮食油料的征购和交售任务呢？根据历来的经验，必须坚决实行快收、快打、快征购、快运送的原则。首先要把收获工作及时做好。在粮食丰收的情况下，有些人可能产生这样的想法：抛撒一点粮食算不了什么，反正也影响不了整个产量。因而收获工作不够细致。这种想法和作法是十分有害的。收获不细致绝不是“算不了什么”的小事，而是一件很值得重视的大事。山西省长治、雁北、忻县、榆次等地区去年秋收时就因为收获粗糙，后来不得不重收一次，结果又从地里拣回一亿二千万斤粮食。陕西咸阳红旗、红光等四个人民公社在已经收获过的地里也拣回了四十五万斤粮食，平均每个公社多增加了十万多斤粮食。既然收获工作关系着粮食实际收获量的高低，关系着公社和社员的切身经济利益，那末，广大社员和干部就应该认真地对待这一工作；收割、打场要做得快，又要做得很细致。绝不让经过辛勤劳动换来的粮食随便抛撒、丢弃在地里或场里，白白地损失掉。只要广大社员认识了收获工作的重要性，并且采取有效的措施，就一定能够做到颗粒还家，把自己辛勤劳动的果实全部收获起来。
    人民公社在做好收获工作的基础上，应该积极地迅速地交售粮食油料给国家，以支援城市和工业建设。自从去年大跃进以来，城市工业生产有了迅速发展。城市工业部门在去年向广大农村提供了各种生产资料以及其它日用工业品，有力地支援了农业生产大跃进。但是，随着工业生产和基本建设的迅速发展，城市人口也迅速增加了，对粮食油料消费的需要也相应地增加了。它们需要农村给予支援，这是很自然的事。现在人民公社按照国家计划的要求，把粮食、油料卖给国家，正是对城市和工业建设的一个有力的支援，而且也是发扬城乡互助的精神。
    小麦、油料的经济价值都比较高，农民历来都是将它们的绝大部分收获当作商品出售。出售小麦、油料而获得的资金历来都是农民一项重要的收入。小麦油料收获以后，很快卖给国家，既有利于保证国家在市场供应和工业原料方面的需要，又便于公社及早安排社员的生活，这对人民公社的巩固和发展也是十分有利的。如果把应该卖给国家的粮食、油料留起来等将来再卖，实际上就等于积压了资金，反而对公社的生产和社员的生活不利。
    夏粮收获以后，各人民公社仍然应当本着勤俭建国的精神，俭吃俭用，按国家征购计划，交纳公粮并把余粮卖给国家。今年国家规定的夏粮征购数量虽比往年稍有增加，但是由于农业生产的迅速提高，征购数字占农业产量的比例却比往年降低了。这就是说，人民公社留粮数量占农业产量的比例相对地增加了。因此，完成夏粮的征购计划是完全可能的，而且也并不影响农民的吃粮和用粮。现在的问题是要向农民进行宣传，告诉他们：即使在丰收的情况下，仍然要实行有计划的消费，注意节约粮食。在粮食问题上，我们必须瞻前顾后，丰收的时候想到可能的歉收，今年想到明年。去年由于农业生产有了很大跃进，广大社员在粮食消费上比以往提高了。但是，也必须看到，我国人口众多，粮食消费量很大。例如每人每天多吃一两粮食，就一个人来说，简直是微不足道，如以全国六亿人口计算，那么一个月就要多消费十八亿斤粮食，一年就是二百十六亿斤。这笔粮食如果掌握在国家手里，就能够用来办很多事情。因此计划用粮、节约粮食是十分重要的。
    去冬今春以来，许多人民公社都在计划用粮方面做出了很好的成绩。例如广西罗城县物华人民公社的三十二个公共食堂，去年下半年按照“三定”的口粮标准合计应该消费一百七十五万斤粮食，但是由于他们认真地按照计划用粮，不断改进食堂管理工作，社员不但吃得饱、吃得好，结算结果还节约了三十九万多斤粮食。类似这样的情况，在各地还有很多。只要各地人民公社在已经取得成绩的基础上，认真总结经验，继续努力，还可以在计划用粮方面做出更大的成绩来。
    粮食、财政、商业、交通运输等有关业务部门在完成夏粮征购工作中，担负着繁重的任务。应当在当地党委统一领导下把本部门的工作和整个征购工作密切结合起来，做到一环扣一环，抓紧时机，一气呵成。目前有关部门除了做好计算和评定工作外，还应当做好收购的组织准备工作，从关心群众、处处为群众方便的观点出发，采取切实的措施，便利社员交售夏粮，节省他们的时间。还要做好商品调运工作，以便使社员出售粮食后，能够及时买回各种日用必需商品。为了组织好夏粮的集运和入库，还必须事前安排好可供调用的人力、畜力和车辆，以便把征购的粮食及时运到交通干线上去。这些工作准备得越充分，就越能很好地贯彻中央指示的“快收、快打、快征购、快运送”的原则，从而胜利地完成今年夏粮和油料的征购任务。
