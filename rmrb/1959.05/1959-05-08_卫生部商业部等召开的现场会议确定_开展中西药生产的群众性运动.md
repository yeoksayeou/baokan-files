Xinhua News Agency Report: The National On-Site Conference on the Production of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicines in Sichuan has determined to launch a mass production movement in the national pharmaceutical production sector to increase output, improve quality, conserve raw materials, simplify the production process, and increase yields, so as to ensure a great leap forward in pharmaceutical production.

This conference was jointly convened in Chengdu recently by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Health Department of the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission. More than 700 representatives from 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the conference.

Last year, all parts of the country achieved good results and rich experience in using small-scale indigenous methods to produce Western medicines, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicines, combining medicine supply and mass health work, and so on. The conference believes that, based on last year's experience, this year's production of traditional Chinese and Western medicines must achieve a continuous great leap forward. In developing the production of Chinese medicinal materials, the basic policy should be: developing the production of "authentic medicinal materials" and the production of medicinal materials in general areas simultaneously; transforming wild animal and plant medicinal materials into domestic breeding and cultivation, and protecting and collecting wild medicinal materials simultaneously; mobilizing the masses to collect, and combining this with the establishment of production specialties. When organizing the production of Chinese medicinal materials, we must vigorously promote the contract system to link the medicinal material production of the people's communes with the national plan. This year, the approximately six million mu of Chinese medicinal materials that have been and will be planted in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have mostly been implemented layer by layer through the contract system. At the same time, we must correctly implement the price policy to promote the production of Chinese medicinal materials and expand commodity circulation.

The conference believes that Western medicine production must combine foreign and indigenous methods, and at the same time vigorously produce pharmaceutical raw materials. According to the characteristics of our country's vast land and large population, in addition to a few major medicines that are suitable for centralized production, the production of general medicines should be appropriately decentralized. General tinctures, solutions, ointments, injections, tablets, and sanitary equipment should gradually achieve self-sufficiency. All localities should also use local resources to produce chemical raw materials for pharmaceutical production to support pharmaceutical factories in large cities. When organizing small-scale indigenous production of Western medicines, we must pay attention to the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and also strengthen leadership, divide labor and cooperate, with large factories leading small factories, and establish necessary cooperative relationships.

Based on the experience of Dengfeng in Henan, Linzi in Shandong, and other places last year, the conference believes that the close combination of medicine and pharmacy, and the assistance of pharmaceutical supply departments to health departments in carrying out mass health work and eliminating diseases, is very good and very popular with the masses. In the future, pharmaceutical supply departments must overcome purely business viewpoints and actively participate in and assist in carrying out mass health campaigns.

This on-site conference also held a Chinese medicinal material commodity exchange meeting. In the spirit of mutual support, the representatives traded more than 540 kinds of Chinese medicinal materials, totaling more than 2.41 million dan, and also signed 853 purchase and sale contracts and 135 material exchange agreements.

    卫生部商业部等召开的现场会议确定
    开展中西药生产的群众性运动
    新华社讯　全国中西药生产四川现场会议，确定要在全国医药生产部门开展一个增加产量，提高质量，节约原料，简化生产过程，提高收得率的群众性生产运动，保证医药生产的大跃进。
    这次会议是由卫生部、商业部、化学工业部、农业部和军委总后勤部卫生部最近联合在成都召开的。出席会议的有二十五个省、市、自治区的代表七百多人。
    去年全国各地在采用小土群办法生产西药方面，在中西药结合、医药供应和群众性的卫生工作结合等方面，都获得了良好的成绩和丰富的经验。会议认为，在运用去年经验的基础上，今年中西药生产必须实现继续大跃进。在发展中药材的生产方面，基本方针应该是：发展“地道药材”生产与一般地区药材生产同时并举，变野生动植物药材为家养家种与保护和采集野生药材同时并举，发动群众采集与建立生产专业相结合。组织中药材生产时，要大力推行合同制度，使人民公社的药材生产同国家计划衔接起来。今年全国各省、市、自治区已种植和将要种植的约六百万亩中药材，绝大部分已通过合同制度层层落实。同时，要正确贯彻价格政策，促进中药材的生产，扩大商品流通。
    会议认为，西药生产必须实行洋土结合，同时要大力生产制药原料。根据我国地广人多的特点，除了少数主要药品适宜于集中生产以外，一般药品的生产应当适当分散。一般的酊、水、油膏、针剂、片剂和卫生器材，应当逐步作到自给。各地还应当利用地方资源，生产制药的化工原料，支持大城市的医药工厂。在组织西药的小土群生产时，必须注意原料的综合利用，还要加强领导，分工合作，以大厂带小厂，建立必要的协作关系。
    会议根据去年河南登封、山东临淄等地的经验，认为医和药密切结合，医药供应部门协助卫生部门开展群众性卫生工作，消灭疾病的作法很好，很受群众欢迎。今后，医药供应部门必须克服单纯业务观点，积极参加和协助开展群众性的卫生运动。
    这次现场会议还举行了中药材商品交流会。代表们本着互相支援的精神，成交了五百四十多种中药材，总数二百四十一万多担，还签订了八百五十三份购销合同、一百三十五份物资交流协议书。
