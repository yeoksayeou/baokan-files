Title: Underground Mining Internship

　　The school assigned me to the No. 203 mining area for an internship. Treading through the mud after the rainstorm, in the vast twilight, I arrived at the workers' shed in the mining area.

　　The section chief led me to the pithead shed, where an old miner in his fifties was sitting, putting calcium carbide into a miner's lamp. The old man had graying hair and a stern face.

　　"Master Sun!" The section chief patted the old miner's shoulder and said, "I've brought you a disciple, a college student." Then the section chief turned to me and said, "Follow him from now on, watch more, do more, and ask if you don't understand. Master Sun is very enthusiastic!"

　　"Yes, yes, I'm just afraid I won't be able to teach him well..." Master Sun stretched out his big hands and helped me up.

　　At the pithead, slogan signs stood one after another; the mile-deep tunnels and colorful signal lights were dazzling; and mine cars roared past us like lightning. I followed closely behind my master, afraid of getting lost in the maze.

　　"This is a percussive hand-cranked rock drill, that's a support, that's a hard alloy drill bit..." In front of the working face, the master introduced these to me in detail, instructing me to watch more first, and then he and his assistant started working. Immediately, water droplets splashed in front of the working face, smoke and dust billowed, the rock drill roared deafeningly, and the rock strata of the roof seemed to be trembling. Through the thick fog, I saw my master, this old driller, wielding the rock drill like a skilled girl wielding an embroidery needle. The first time I worked the night shift, drowsiness kept attacking me, and the deafening noise of the rock drill suddenly became like a gentle lullaby. At this time, I thought: Today is the weekend. In my alma mater, the teachers and students have already finished watching the movie and entered sweet dreams, but here, my teacher, the workers beside me, are still working diligently. People are contributing their strength in different positions, working selflessly for the prosperity and strength of the motherland...

　　With a "hiss," the exhaust gas screeched, and the rock drill stopped. I suddenly woke up. It was time to move to another working face. I grabbed a large wrench to unscrew the bolts, and the master threw the blunted drill bits into the dirt basket.

　　My master and I carried the drilling machine and moved to a new working face.

　　"You can't let your mind wander when you're working!" He said as he walked, "Mining is hard, but it's like eating olives, the more you chew, the more flavorful it becomes. Think about it, that piece of steel, that light bulb, wouldn't exist without our contribution!" As he spoke, he smiled proudly and quickened his pace.

　　When installing the drill, the master said with emotion:
  "The year before last, a student-like person came to the mine, pointing fingers and talking eloquently, but when he picked up the drill, 'crack,' the drill bit broke, and it took more than an hour just to deal with the accident. You can't learn from him!"

　　"Of course not," I replied, blushing, remembering what the section chief had told me when I came up the mountain: "Learn patiently. Don't be impatient when learning technology from Master Sun. The old man doesn't like 'nouveau riches.' He often says, 'This kind of person is like a match, it lights up with a single strike, but it goes out quickly too. What I like is someone like tinder, slow and steady, but extremely reliable. No matter how you blow on it, the more you blow, the brighter it gets.'"

　　My master is such a simple and conscientious person.

　　Three days had passed, and I had been doing auxiliary work. Every time my hands itched to play with the rock drill, but I didn't dare to bring it up, fearing that I would affect the reputation that this machine had earned in the mining area.

　　On the fourth day of work, the master found that I wasn't wearing a safety helmet. It turned out that I had forgotten it at the bottom of the bed in the dormitory because I wanted to cool off in the heat.

　　"I've told you a hundred times, haven't you seen this?" The master's face could have frost scraped off of it. He was referring to a large sign at the pithead, which clearly read: Three treasures for entering the tunnel: miner's lamp, mask, and safety helmet. How could I have forgotten?

　　The master handed me his own mining helmet.

　　"What about you?" I asked softly.

　　He didn't say a word. He went over and stopped a worker who had just finished his shift and took the safety helmet off his head.

　　My face flushed, feeling as uncomfortable as if I had swallowed half a pound of chili powder. When would a person like me be trusted by the master to play with that wild, leopard-like drilling machine?

　　When installing the rock drill in front of the working face, unexpectedly, the master said to me: "This shift, the two of us will use this rock drill together. You be the operator, and I'll be the assistant. We, one old and one young, have to set an example and at least maintain the quota." I couldn't believe my ears and wanted to hug the master with joy.

　　People and machines were once again wrapped in the rising mist and the roaring of the machine. At first, the master held my hand, as if teaching a beginner student. Later, in the misty water, the master made various gestures towards me and shouted loudly:

　　"Air volume - too - small", "Excavate the cut hole, a little slanted, change the drill bit, good!"...

　　As we worked, we were covered in sweat. I didn't even notice the water dripping from the roof of the rock onto my body. At this time, the master took off his raincoat and put it on me.

　　This shift, we steadily maintained the quota and even exceeded it a little.

　　"Not bad, young man," the master encouraged me when we got off work.

　　I tightly grasped the master's hand. We walked out of the tunnel side by side, greeted by the dawn of midsummer.

    下矿实习
    李雪萍
    学校分配我到二零三矿区去实习。踏着暴雨后的泥泞，在苍茫的暮色中，我来到矿区的工棚里。
    工段长把我领到坑口工棚里，那里坐着一个五十开外年纪的老矿工，他正在往矿灯里装电石。老头儿头发灰白，有着一副严峻的面孔。
      “老孙师傅！”工段长拍着老矿工的肩膀说：“给你送个徒弟来了，还是大学生呢。”接着工段长回过头来对我说：“以后你就跟着他老人家学吧，多看，多做，不懂就问，孙师傅可热呼哩！”
    “使得使得，就怕咱带不好呢，……”孙师傅伸出一双大手把我搀住了。
    在坑口，标语牌一座连着一座；一里多深的坑道，五彩缤纷的信号灯，使人眼花缭乱；矿车轰响着，从身旁风驰电掣而过。我紧跟在师傅身后，生怕陷入了迷阵。
    “这是冲击式手摇风钻，那是支架，那是硬合金钎头……”在掌子面前，师傅详细地向我介绍这些，嘱咐我先多看看，他就和他的助手干起来。这时掌子面前立即水珠四射，烟尘滚滚，风钻突突的吼叫着，震耳欲聋，顶板的岩层，像是在颤抖着。透过浓雾，我看见我的师傅，这位年老的风钻手，摆弄起风钻来，就像巧姑娘手里的绣花针一样。第一次上夜班，瞌睡不时袭来，风钻的震耳的骚音忽然变得像柔和的催眠曲了。这时我想：今天是周末，在我的母校里，老师们和同学们已经看完电影，进入甜蜜的梦乡了，而在这儿，我的老师傅，我身旁的工人们，还在勤奋地工作着。人们在不同的工作岗位上，贡献出他们的力量，为祖国的繁荣富强而忘我地劳动……
      “嗤”的一声，废气嘶叫着，风钻煞住了，这时我蓦地清醒过来。要转到别的掌子面去了，我抓起大扳卸螺钉，师傅把那些弄钝了的钎头丢进土箕里。
    我和师傅抬着钻机，向新的掌子面转移。
      “干工作，思想可不能开小差啊！”他边走边说：“开矿工作苦是苦，可是像吃橄榄呀，越到后面越觉有味儿。你想想看，那一块钢，那一盏电灯，没有咱们一分功劳！”他说着，自豪地笑起来，加快了脚步。
    装钻的时候，师傅感慨地说：
  “大前年，矿上来了个学生模样的人，指手划脚，说的头头是道，可是让他一拿钻，‘咔嚓’钎断了，光处理事故就花一个多钟点，你可不能学他啊！”
      “哪能呢。”我红着脸回答，想起上山时工段长给我说的话：“耐心的学吧，跟孙师傅学技术不能性急，老头子不喜欢‘暴发户’，他常说：‘这种人就像火柴，一擦就着，灭起来也快。我喜欢的，要像火绒那样，慢慢的，可是顶可靠，不管你怎么吹，越吹越旺。’”
    我的师傅就是这么个淳朴认真的人。
    三天过去了，我一直做辅助工作，每回手都痒痒的，想摆弄风钻，又不敢提出来，深怕自己会影响这台机器在矿区里得到过的声誉。
    第四次上班时，师傅发现我没带安全帽。原来，天热贪图凉快，我把它忘在宿舍床底下了。
      “都说过一百遍啦，你没看过这个？”师傅的脸能刮下一层霜。他指的是坑口的一块大牌子，上面明明写着：入窿三件宝，矿灯、口罩、安全帽。我怎么给忘了呢？
    师傅把自己的矿帽递给我。
    “你呢”？我小声地问。
    他没吱声。过去拦住一个刚下班的工人，从他头上摘下了安全帽。
    我的脸一阵发热，像一下子吞下半磅辣椒面似地难受。像我这样一个人，师傅几时才放心让我摆弄那野豹性子一样的钻机啊。
    在掌子面前，安装风钻的时候，出乎意外地，师傅对我说：“这班咱俩合使这台风钻，你当机工，我当助手，咱一老一少，得做出个样儿来，至少得保住定额。”我简直不相信自己的耳朵了，乐得直想把师傅拥抱起来。
    人和机器，又被裹在那腾腾的雾气和那突突轰响的机声中。起始，师傅把着我的手，就像教刚发蒙的小学生一样。后来，在水雾蒙胧中，师傅朝我做各种手势，大声地喊：
  “气量——太——小”，“掏槽眼，斜一点，换钎，好！”……
    干着干着，已闹的满头大汗。顶岩漏下的水淅淅沥沥地浇在身上我也不觉得。这时师傅却脱下自己的雨衣披在我身上。
    这一班，我们稳稳的保住了定额，还冒了点尖。
    “干得不坏，小伙子。”下班的时候，师傅鼓励我。
    我紧紧地握着师傅的手。我们并肩走出窿外，迎接我们的是盛夏黎明时分的曙光。
