Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Buenos Aires News: Cuban Prime Minister Castro said here on the 2nd that "the Cuban revolution is glorious for becoming the first revolution in Latin America to punish the executioners who slaughtered the people." Castro made these remarks at a press conference attended by more than 500 people. Castro arrived in Buenos Aires on the 1st to participate in the Twenty-One Nation Conference being held there.

Castro said that for four centuries, executioners have massacred the people of Latin America, but it is the first time that the people have punished the executioners who slaughtered them. Castro said that all Cuban people support the just punishment of the main criminals who massacred 20,000 Cubans. These criminals are in the thousands, including those who carried out the killings and the secret agents. Castro also said that in Latin America, which has suffered from terror and tyranny, it is a tragedy that a revolutionary government has to expend so much effort to uphold the just punishment of the executioners who massacred 20,000 of its citizens. Castro said that the Cuban government hopes to guarantee human rights on the basis of social justice.

In response to whether he supports the establishment of a Federation of Caribbean Republics, Castro said, why not talk about a patriotic ideal like a Federation of Latin American States?

Castro also emphasized that the Cuban revolution has the support of the people because the government has taken measures such as lowering the high cost of living, land reform, and national industrialization. He said that 90% of the people support the government. He pointed out that it is not enough to give land to the peasants; they must be given new types of farming machinery, technical assistance, and loans. He said that the Cuban government's aim is to establish a domestic market so that Cuba's national industry can develop and solve the problem of 700,000 unemployed people.

The attendees applauded the Cuban leader warmly and cheered for the revolution, the Cuban people, and Castro himself for a long time.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th. TASS, Buenos Aires, 4th News: According to local newspapers, Cuban Prime Minister Castro said at the "Twenty-One Nation Committee" meeting attended by Latin American countries and the United States that the Latin American people should make the greatest efforts to solve their own economic problems.

The "Twenty-One Nation Committee" was held in the capital of Argentina on April 28 to discuss the so-called "economic cooperation" issue.

Castro criticized the trade and fiscal policies adopted by the United States towards Latin American countries. He pointed out that the living standards of Latin American countries are only one-sixth of those of the United States. He called for all measures to be taken to prosper the economies of Latin American countries. These measures include accumulating funds, tapping potential, and attracting foreign investment. Castro said, "If we can freely sell all our products, we can accumulate funds. If the United States removes all restrictions on the sale of our main products and eliminates subsidies for goods that compete with us, then we can sell all our products and obtain the necessary amount of foreign exchange and gold reserves to develop the country."

Castro criticized the United States for often wanting to use U.S. aid to exert economic and political pressure on other countries.

    卡斯特罗在阿根廷指出
    全体古巴人民支持惩处刽子手
    并批评美国用美援对其他国家施加压力
    新华社3日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：古巴总理卡斯特罗2日在这里说，“古巴革命成为拉丁美洲第一个惩处残杀人民的刽子手的革命是它的光荣”。卡斯特罗是在一个有五百多人参加的记者招待会上讲这番话的。卡斯特罗为参加在这里举行的二十一国会议于1日来到布宜诺斯艾利斯。
    卡斯特罗说，四个世纪以来，刽子手们对拉丁美洲人民进行屠杀，但是人民惩办残杀他们的刽子手却是破天荒第一次。卡斯特罗说，全体古巴人民都支持对曾经残杀了两万古巴人的主要罪犯所进行的正义惩处。这些罪犯是数以千计的，其中包括实际执行人和密探。卡斯特罗还说，在饱经恐怖和暴政统治的拉丁美洲，一个革命政府需要费这么大力气来维护它的曾经残杀了两万公民的刽子手的正义惩处是一个悲剧。卡斯特罗说，古巴政府希望在社会正义的基础上保障人权。
    在回答他是否支持建立加勒比共和国联邦的问题时，卡斯特罗说，为什么不谈谈像拉丁美洲国家联邦这样一个爱国主义的理想呢。
    卡斯特罗还强调指出，古巴革命得到人民的支持，因为政府采取了降低高昂的生活费、土地改革和国家工业化等措施。他说，90％的人民支持政府。他指出，把土地交给农民是不够的，必须给农民以新式的耕作机器、技术援助和贷款。他说，古巴政府的目的是要建立一个国内市场，使古巴的民族工业得以发展，并且解决七十万失业者的问题。
    与会者向这位古巴领袖热烈鼓掌，并且长时间地向革命、古巴人民和卡斯特罗本人欢呼。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯4日讯：据当地报纸报道，古巴总理卡斯特罗在拉丁美洲国家和美国参加的“二十一国委员会”会议上说，拉丁美洲人民应当在解决自己经济问题上尽最大努力。
      “二十一国委员会”于4月28日在阿根廷首都召开，讨论所谓“经济合作”问题。
    卡斯特罗批评了美国对拉丁美洲国家所采取的贸易政策和财政政策。他指出，拉丁美洲国家的生活水平只等于美国生活水平的六分之一。他号召采取一切措施来繁荣拉丁美洲国家的经济。这些措施包括积累资金、挖掘潜力和吸引外资。卡斯特罗说，“如果我们能够自由地出售我们的一切产品，就可以积累资金。如果美国取消对我们主要产品销售的一切限制，取消对那些同我们竞争的商品的补助金，那么我们就能出售我们的一切产品，获得必要数量的外汇和黄金储备来发展国家”。
    卡斯特罗批评美国经常想利用美援对其他国家施加经济和政治压力。
