    Simultaneous Exploration, Production, and Construction
    Cold Lake No. 5 Oilfield Accelerates Development
    (Our newspaper, Xining, 19th dispatch) On the rapidly developing Cold Lake No. 5 Oilfield in Qaidam, petroleum exploration, crude oil extraction, and oilfield construction are advancing simultaneously. Since it was confirmed in September last year that this is a very promising large oilfield, more than 10,000 employees from various petroleum exploration areas in Qaidam have come to participate in the development work. Here, towering derricks have been erected on the undulating Gobi Desert, and large areas of tents and mobile homes have been built. Material trucks and oil tankers shuttle back and forth, creating spiderweb-like new roads on the sand. A "battle to seize oil" has begun, and petroleum workers are expanding exploration, building oilfields, and extracting crude oil at the same time.
    The method of rapidly developing the Cold Lake No. 5 Oilfield through simultaneous exploration, production, and construction is adapted to the current need for crude oil, and also takes into account the long-term development of the oilfield in the future. Since the area of this high-pressure, self-flowing oilfield may be very large, and only a portion of the reserves has been proven in a part of the area, on the one hand, production wells are being drilled to extract crude oil and oilfield construction is being carried out. On the other hand, pre-exploration wells are being drilled in the periphery to expand the oilfield area and explore for more reserves. The production wells here appear to be relatively dense on the surface, but are relatively sparse in terms of the same oil layer, because they are drilled in groups on different oil layers. This not only concentrates the extraction of crude oil, but also protects the oilfield. In terms of oilfield construction, in addition to a large number of production wells that have been drilled, three multi-well oil selection stations have been built, and a 20-kilometer-long water pipe has been laid. Another water pipe, more production wells and oil selection stations, a mechanical repair plant, and a refinery are also under construction or about to start construction.
    The adoption of the "three simultaneous" (simultaneous exploration, production, and construction) method has resulted in "three mores" - more area explored, more reserves delivered, and more crude oil produced. Since the beginning of this year, the scope of pre-exploration has been continuously expanding, and the oilfield area has been expanded on the basis of last year, and more crude oil reserves have been submitted. With the progress of oilfield construction work, crude oil production is also increasing day by day, and the oil extraction plan is overfulfilled every month, and it is continuously transported out of the Qaidam Basin, conveying new blood to the country's industrial construction.
    Cold Lake No. 5 Oilfield is located in the northern part of the Qaidam Basin and has more convenient transportation conditions than other oilfields in the basin. The oil reservoirs here are not deep, there are many oil layers, and the oil layers are thick. The workers call it a "building-style" oilfield, and the oil quality is good, containing nearly half gasoline. It is also high-pressure and self-flowing, which is easy to develop. Therefore, once discovered, it was identified as the focus of Qaidam's petroleum work, concentrating 80% of the force to accelerate its development. Cold Lake No. 5 Oilfield is only an oil-bearing structure in the Cold Lake area. There are twelve possible oil-bearing structures in this vast area. Exploration wells have been drilled in several structures, and all have experienced oil or gas shows. With the development of the No. 5 Oilfield, the secrets of the petroleum resources of the entire Cold Lake area will also be gradually revealed. (Yang Liben)

### 边勘探  边生产  边建设  冷湖五号油田加速开发

    边勘探  边生产  边建设
    冷湖五号油田加速开发
    本报西宁19日电　在快速开发着的柴达木冷湖五号油田上，石油勘探、原油开采和油田建设齐头并进。自从去年9月肯定这里是一个极有希望的大油田以来，从柴达木各个石油探区前来参加开发工作的职工已经超过一万人。这里，起伏的戈壁滩上树起了林立的井架，帐房和活动房屋建成了大片，器材车和油罐车穿梭来往，在沙滩上驶出了蛛网般的新路。一场“夺油大战”已经展开，石油战士们一面扩大勘探，一面建设油田和开采原油。
    边勘探、边生产、边建设的快速开发冷湖五号油田的方法，是适应当前对于原油的需要，又考虑到油田今后的长远发展的。由于这座高压自喷油田的面积可能很大，目前还只在一部分面积上探明一部分储量，所以一方面打生产井开采原油和进行油田建设，一方面在外围打预探井等以扩大油田面积，探求更多储量。这里的生产井在地面看是较密的，但就同一油层来看是较稀的，因为它们分组打在不同的油层上。这样做，既集中开采了原油，又保护了油田。在油田建设方面，除已打好大批生产井，还建成了三座多井选油站，铺设了一条二十公里长的水管。另一条水管、更多的生产井和选油站、一座机械修配厂和一座炼油厂也正在施工或马上就要动工。
    采用“三边”（边勘探、边生产、边建设）的办法获得了“三多”——探面积多、交储量多、产原油多的结果。今年以来，预探的范围不断伸展，已经在去年的基础上扩大了油田面积，提交了更多的原油储量。随着油田建设工作的进展，原油产量也一天天增多，每月都超额完成采油计划，并源源运出柴达木盆地，为国家工业建设输送着新的血液。
    冷湖五号油田在柴达木盆地北部，比盆地其他油田有着较为便利的交通条件。这里油藏不深，油层多，油层厚，职工们称之为“楼房式”油田，而且油质好，含汽油近一半，又是高压自喷，便于开发，所以一经发现就被确定为柴达木石油工作的重点，集中80％的力量加以快速开发。冷湖五号油田还只是冷湖地区的一个储油构造，在这片辽阔的地区上共有十二个可能储油构造，已经在好几个构造上钻了探井，都曾经喷油流油或有油气显示。随着五号油田的开发，整个冷湖地区的石油资源秘密也将逐步被人们揭开。（杨立本）
