Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 30th — Yunnan Province has allocated over 400,000 jin of tea to support Tibetan compatriots, and this batch of tea is currently being transported to Lhasa via the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways.

This batch of tea is made entirely of famous Pu'er tea and Zhenkang tea, crafted into brick tea and heart-shaped "tight tea" according to the preferences of the Tibetan people. This type of tea has been sold in Lhasa for many years and is deeply loved by the Tibetan people. From 1955 to the present, Yunnan Province has transported over 6.8 million jin of tight tea and brick tea to Tibet.

This year, Yunnan has had a bumper harvest of spring tea, and tea farmers of all ethnic groups are selling high-quality green tea to supply Tibetan compatriots and the people of the whole country. The Dali Tea Factory, which specializes in manufacturing tea for the Tibetan people, is increasing its fermentation and tea-cutting equipment in order to manufacture tight tea and brick tea on a large scale.

    云南名茶两路运入西藏
    新华社昆明30日电　云南省调出四十多万斤茶叶支援西藏同胞，现在这批茶叶正分别由康藏和青藏两条公路运往拉萨。
    这批茶叶全部是用著名的普洱茶和镇康茶，按照藏民的喜好制造的砖茶和心脏形的“紧茶”。这种茶已行销拉萨多年，深得藏民喜爱，从1955年到现在，云南省运往西藏的紧茶和砖茶已达六百八十多万斤。
    今年云南的春茶丰收，各族茶农正出售质量优良的青茶，供应藏族同胞和全国人民。专门给藏民制造茶叶的大理制茶厂，正在增加发酵、切茶的设备，以便大量制造紧茶和砖茶。
