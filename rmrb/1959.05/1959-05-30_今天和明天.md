    Today and Tomorrow

    A ship cannot sail without a航道, and a vehicle cannot move without a road. In coal production, if tunneling work cannot keep up, coal production will be affected. Therefore, tunneling (stripping) and coal mining must maintain a certain growth ratio.
    This year, the national coal mines launched a vigorous socialist labor competition movement for large-scale bumper harvests. The pace of coal mining has accelerated, and the mining time of the mining faces has been shortened. This requires extra strengthening of tunneling work, otherwise, the mining and tunneling will be out of balance, preventing the movement from continuing to move forward.
    This principle seems simple, but in actual production activities, it has not been fully grasped by people. According to the Ministry of Coal Industry's inspection, among the 25 comparable units under the Ministry, at the end of April, only 42 out of 117 mines had reserve working faces.
    Why is the tunneling preparation work not keeping up with production needs? Some people say that because this year's coal production leap is very large, the production tasks are too heavy. Yes, the heavy task of coal production is indeed a fact; it is not unique to a certain coal mine, but is generally present; however, some units that shoulder heavy burdens can simultaneously strengthen coal mining and tunneling, so that the connection between mining and tunneling is relatively good. For example, Zibo Coal Mine plans to increase its output by nearly 50% this year by tapping the potential of old mines. This burden is not light, but their coal acquisition has been increasing month by month this year, ensuring a steady increase in coal production. The monthly progress of the Kailuan Coal Mine's mining face last year was 53 meters, but this year it increased to 69 meters in April. Calculating this way, the pace of coal mining has accelerated by more than 30%, and the amount of coal obtained has not decreased as a result. Up to now, it has been increasing month by month to a level of more than five and a half months. There are many units like this. It can be seen that heavy tasks do not mean disrupting the connection between coal mining and tunneling, and do not mean that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between coal mining and tunneling.
    Looking at the distance and starting from the near, seeing today and also considering tomorrow, this is a problem that must be seriously considered in continuous mass production. Only by correctly handling the relationship between today and tomorrow, the long-term and the immediate, can we strive for high production today and even higher production tomorrow. Take the initiative from foresight. Without foresight, we cannot master the initiative of production. Only grasping output, ignoring tunneling, being busy with today, and not caring about tomorrow, as a result, although temporary high output can be obtained, a passive situation of declining output will soon appear.
    The leaders of each mine should make a decisive decision and quickly reverse the current situation where tunneling (stripping) lags behind coal mining. If mining is the first line of coal mine production, then tunneling should be the first line of the first line. Production plans must be implemented, and production preparation work must also be implemented. This requires first figuring out the bottom line of production preparation, understanding the situation, finding out the reasons, and prescribing the right medicine. In short, the leadership must truly grasp production with one hand and preparation with the other, and grasp production preparation work as hard as they grasp output. In particular, for those units whose coal output is affected due to the uncoordinated connection between mining and tunneling, priority should be given to ensuring tunneling in terms of leadership and production strength, and the supply of materials and equipment. One cannot be afraid of temporarily affecting output and relax production preparation work, causing long-term passivity. Doing so is a long-term plan for developing production.

    今天和明天
    冰洁
    没有航道行不了船，没有道路走不了车，在煤炭生产中掘进工作跟不上，煤炭产量就会受到影响。因此，掘进（剥离）和采煤必须保持一定的增长比例。
    今年，全国煤矿展开了轰轰烈烈的大面积丰产的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，采煤进度加快了，回采工作面的开采时间缩短了，这就要求掘进工作格外加强，否则就会采、掘失调，使运动不能继续地向前发展。
    这个道理看来浅显，但是在实际生产活动中，它还没有完全被人们掌握。根据煤炭部检查，该部所属二十五个可比单位，在4月末，一百十七个矿井中，有备用工作面的只有四十二个矿。
    为什么掘进准备工作赶不上生产需要？有人说，由于今年煤炭跃进幅度很大，生产任务压得太重。是的，煤炭生产任务繁重确是事实；它不是某个煤矿的特有情况，而是普遍存在的；但是，也有些肩负重担的单位，能够同时加强采煤和掘进，使采、掘衔接比较好。例如淄博煤矿今年要依靠挖掘旧有矿井的潜力，把产量提高将近50％，这个担子不算轻了，然而他们今年的获得煤量却在逐月增长，保证了煤炭产量稳步上升。开滦煤矿去年回采工作面月进度为五十三公尺，今年到4月份就上长到六十九公尺，算起来采煤进度加快了30％多，获得煤量也并没因此降低，到目前已经逐月增长到五个半月以上的水平。像这样的单位还有不少。可见，任务压得重并不意味着破坏采煤和掘进的衔接，并不意味采煤和掘进两者之间没有不可调和的矛盾。
    远处着眼，近处着手，看到今天，也要顾到明天，这是在连续性的大生产中必须认真考虑的问题。正确地处理了今天和明天，长远和眼前的关系，才能既争得今天的高产，又争得明天的更高产。主动出之远见，没有远见，就不能掌握生产的主动权；单抓产量，忽视掘进，忙于今天，不顾明天，结果，虽然也能获得一时的高产，但是很快就会出现产量下降的被动局面。
    各矿领导应该当机立断，迅速扭转掘进（剥离）落后于采煤的现状。如果说，回采是煤矿生产的第一线，那么，掘进应该是第一线中的第一线。生产计划要落实，生产准备工作也要落实。这就需要首先摸清生产准备的底，洞悉情况，找出原因，对症下药。总之，领导上要真正做到一手抓生产，一手抓准备，要狠狠地抓产量那样抓生产准备工作。特别对那些由于采、掘衔接不协调，影响煤炭产量的单位，在领导和生产力量上，材料设备的供应上，都应当首先保证掘进，不能只怕一时影响产量而放松生产准备工作，造成长期被动。这样做，才是发展生产的长久之计。
