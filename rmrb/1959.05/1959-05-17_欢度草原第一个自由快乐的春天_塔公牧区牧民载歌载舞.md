(Reported by this newspaper) The Tagong pasture area after the democratic reform has presented a flourishing spring scene. More than three thousand herdsmen liberated from the shackles of the feudal herdowners are greeting the first free and happy spring on the grassland with unprecedented labor enthusiasm.

Two months ago, when the democratic reform was just victoriously completed, the herdsmen could not restrain their excitement. They lit bonfires on the grassland and sang and danced all night for several days. Horse races were held everywhere, and everyone greeted each other with highland barley wine, with endless joy to share. During these joyful days, the first batch of pastoral production cooperatives was established, and one-third of the herding households joined the cooperatives. Under the leadership of the local Party organization and the newly established pastoral area people's government, the herdsmen of the entire district formulated a plan for developing pastoral production this year, centered around the cooperatives. The herdsmen proposed to cultivate 1,200 mu of forage base in the entire district this year. The original plan was to increase the number of livestock in the entire district by 8% this year, but the herdsmen said that now we are working for ourselves and we want to develop faster. They proposed to carefully raise female livestock and resolutely increase this year's growth rate to 24%. Recently, a batch of fine breeds such as Gatz sheep, Dutch cows, and Beijing horses have been introduced here, and some young herdsmen are learning artificial insemination and veterinary epidemic prevention technologies.

After the completion of the democratic reform, the people's government immediately opened a primary school here. Herdsmen who had never been exposed to culture for generations urgently demanded that their children be able to read and write. The school originally planned to enroll 50 students, but there were more than 200 children who wanted to enroll. Some herdsmen were afraid that the school would not have enough space, so they brought their own tents and set them up next to the school. In order to meet the wishes of the herdsmen, two more primary schools are under construction. Service institutions such as health clinics, veterinary stations, and trade companies that serve the herdsmen have also been established one after another.

The dark and painful days on the grassland are gone forever. Herdsman Eran Gujin rented twelve cattle from the herdowner's family before the reform. Each year, the total income was not enough to pay the rent, and the debt to the herdowner increased year by year. She couldn't even eat a meal of tsampa (roasted barley flour) once a year, and relied on wild vegetables and wild fruits to satisfy her hunger. In the end, the herdowner robbed her of her tent and furniture. She had no choice but to sell her only two-year-old daughter to pay off the debt. Eran Gujin had to flee to other places with her husband. It was not until the reform that she returned to her hometown, was allocated eight cattle and a new tent, and joined the cooperative. She actively worked in the cooperative. In the preliminary distribution last month, she received 60 yuan from sideline income alone. In the past, incidents of being forced to flee by herdowners often occurred. Many people wandered in foreign lands and died on the way, unable to be as lucky as Eran Gujin to live to this day. In the past, many herdsmen in the Tagong pasture area could not afford tents and lived in caves year after year. Now, every family has four or five meals of buttered tsampa a day (herdsmen are accustomed to eating less and more frequently). Not only do people live in new tents, but even livestock have tents to cover them. In the past month, more than two hundred of the seven hundred herdsmen families in the district have married off daughters or taken wives. More than one hundred young herdsmen couples who used to wander around and could not start a family have also registered to get married at the People's Government.

### 欢度草原第一个自由快乐的春天  塔公牧区牧民载歌载舞

    欢度草原第一个自由快乐的春天
    塔公牧区牧民载歌载舞
    本报讯　民主改革后的塔公牧区，已经呈现出一片欣欣向荣的春
  日景象。三千多个从封建牧主的枷锁下解放出来的牧民，正以空前未有的劳动热情，迎接草原上第一个自由快乐的春天。
    两个月前，民主改革刚刚胜利完成的时候，牧民们忍不住自己的兴奋心情，在草原上燃起火堆，一连好几天歌舞通宵，到处举行跑马比赛，人人见面都要互敬青稞酒，有说不完的欢乐。就在这欢乐的日子里，建立了第一批牧业生产合作社，三分之一的牧户入了社。全区牧民在当地党组织和新建立的牧区人民政府的领导下，以合作社为核心制订了今年发展牧业生产的规划。牧民们提出今年要在全区开垦出一千二百亩饲料基地。原来计划全区今年牲畜增殖8％，牧民们说现在我们是为自己劳动，要发展快些，他们提出要精心饲养母畜，并坚决地把今年的增殖率提高到24％。最近，这里还引进了一批盖茨羊、荷兰牛、北京马等优良种畜，一些青年牧民正在学习人工授精和兽疫防治等技术。
    民主改革完成后，人民政府立即就在这里开办了一所小学，祖祖辈辈没有接触过文化的牧民们，迫切要求自己的子女能够读书识字，学校原计划招生五十名，可是要求入学的儿童却有二百多，有的牧民怕学校住不下，就自己带来帐篷搭在学校旁边。为了满足牧民的愿望，又有两所小学正在动工兴建。卫生所、兽防站、贸易公司等为牧民服务的机构，也已纷纷建立起来。
    草原上黑暗痛苦的日子已经一去不复返了。牧民额然古金在改革前租了牧主家十二头牛，每年全部收入缴了租金还不够，欠牧主的债一年比一年多，一年吃不上一顿糌粑，靠野菜、野果充饥，最后，牧主抢走了她的帐篷、家具，她没有办法，只有卖掉她唯一的两岁女儿，才算偿清了债务。额然古金只得和丈夫一道流亡他乡。直到改革时，她才回到家乡，分到了八头牛和一顶新帐篷，加入了合作社。她在社里积极干活，上月预分中，仅副业收入一项她就分了六十元。过去，被牧主逼迫逃亡的事件经常发生，许多人流浪异乡，死于道途，不能像额然古金这样幸运地活到今天。塔公牧区过去许多牧民住不上帐篷，成年累月地栖息在岩洞。现在，每家一天都是四、五餐酥油糌粑（牧民习惯少吃多餐），不但人住进了新帐篷，连牲畜也有帐篷遮盖。最近一个月里，全区七百多户牧民中就有二百多户嫁女娶媳，一百多对从前到处流浪，无法成家立业的青年男女牧民，也到人民政府登记结婚了。
