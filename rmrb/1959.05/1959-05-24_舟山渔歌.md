    The red sun shines on the sea,
    The wind is calm, the waves are still, the clouds and mist dissipate.
    Countless white sails drift in the distance,
    Crowds on the shore wave their hands.
    Fishing boats return in formation, fully loaded,
    Singing of the harvest, enjoying carefree joy.
    Carefree joy, carefree joy,
    The past hardships are unforgettable:
    A small boat drifts in the waves,
    Catching only two or three fish.
    Bureaucrats' taxes burned like fire,
    Pirates robbed without mercy.
    Without mercy, without mercy,
    Generations starved and never had enough to eat.
    Since the Communist Party came to lead,
    The navy patrols and stands guard,
    The weather station reports the climate,
    Collective fishing raises morale.
    Cast the nets diligently, haul the ropes tightly,
    Catching tens of thousands of fish.
    Singing fishing songs, faces beaming with smiles,
    Removing tattered clothes, putting on new padded jackets.
    Everyone thanks the Communist Party,
    Happy life rises step by step.

### 舟山渔歌

    舟山渔歌
    红太阳，海上照，
    风平浪静云雾消。
    无数白帆远远飘，
    岸上人群把手招。
    成队渔船满载归，
    歌唱丰收乐逍遥。
    乐逍遥，乐逍遥，
    过去苦处忘不了：
    一叶小船浪里飘，
    捕得鱼儿两三条。
    官僚逼税如火烧，
    海盗抢劫不肯饶。
    不肯饶，不肯饶，
    祖祖辈辈吃不饱。
    自从共产党来领导，
    海军巡逻又放哨，
    气象台把气候报，
    集体捕鱼劲头高。
    勤撒网，紧收绳，
    捕得鱼儿千万条。
    唱起渔歌脸挂笑，
    脱掉破絮换新袄。
    人人感谢共产党，
    幸福生活步步高。
