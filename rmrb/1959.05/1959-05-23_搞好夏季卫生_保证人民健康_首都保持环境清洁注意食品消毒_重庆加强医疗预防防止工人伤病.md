    Promote Summer Hygiene and Ensure People's Health
    The Capital Maintains Environmental Cleanliness and Pays Attention to Food Disinfection
    Chongqing Strengthens Medical Prevention to Prevent Worker Injuries and Illnesses

    (Our report) Beijing – On the basis of launching a sanitation campaign before the "May Day" holiday, the people of the capital are actively turning various pest control activities into routine practices.

    Currently, getting up early to clean courtyards and sweeping and watering the streets have become habits of the people. Even on windy and sandy days, people try their best to keep the environment clean. Employees of agencies, schools, and other units along the road from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace in Haidian District used their rest time to clean this road, which stretches for more than ten kilometers. Many food service industries regard doing a good job in food hygiene as a major aspect of improving service quality. The food service and non-staple food industries in Dongcheng District also regard "good hygiene" as a standard for the "five goods" competition. Many restaurants have further improved their hygiene organizations and systems, improved food processing and storage, added necessary sanitary equipment, and paid attention to food disinfection and the personal hygiene of employees. The Beijing Hotel strictly implements the "three disinfection" system for disinfecting raw fruits and vegetables, disinfecting the hands of those who prepare ready-to-eat foods, and disinfecting tableware. In carrying out routine hygiene work, the masses have also come up with many methods. The Hongxing Dumpling Shop in Tianqiao not only strictly separates knives and cutting boards for raw and cooked foods, but also has two refrigerators for storing raw and cooked foods. The tableware used in this restaurant undergoes four stages of cleaning: alkaline water washing, clean water washing, and boiling disinfection. Taking off work clothes before going to the toilet and washing hands after using the toilet have become habits for employees. The Beijing Epidemic Prevention Station has summarized the experience of farmers in mountainous areas such as Mentougou and Zhoukoudian in using wild plants such as藜芦 (Veratrum nigrum) and乌头 (Aconitum) to eliminate mosquitoes and flies and is preparing to promote this method.

    In order to ensure the regular continuation of sanitation activities, the street offices in each district have further improved various hygiene organizations, established street cleaning systems and inspection systems with hierarchical responsibilities and area-based contracts. In addition to establishing and consolidating various systems, Dongcheng District has also established a district-wide regular inspection and evaluation system to continuously encourage the masses to learn from and catch up with the advanced, laying a mass foundation for the regularization of hygiene work.

    Each district has also paid attention to improving the public's level of sanitary scientific knowledge in order to consolidate the gains and continuously improve the quality of hygiene work. Currently, each district has organized many cooks, child-care workers, food managers, feeders, and fertilizer accumulation team members to begin learning sanitary scientific knowledge so that they understand the principles of paying attention to hygiene and make hygiene work more meticulous. In Dongcheng District, more than 22,000 street activists, courtyard hygiene leaders, child-care workers, cooks, and food service industry employees are learning sanitary scientific knowledge. They have become the backbone force for carrying out in-depth hygiene publicity work and ensuring the regular continuation of hygiene activities.

    (Our report) Chongqing – This year, Chongqing's factory and mine hygiene work particularly emphasizes "preventing both disease and injury, emphasizing both treatment and prevention" to ensure worker health and reduce injury and illness absenteeism.

    Chongqing is an important iron and steel industrial base in Sichuan. Since last year, a large number of new workers have been added to the factories and mines, especially workers operating in high-temperature workshops such as iron and steel, coking, and casting, as well as those working outdoors on basic construction. Now that the summer season is approaching, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party organizations of various factories and mines emphasize that while ensuring production, they must also care for the safety and health of employees and take measures to actively prevent and control burns and scalds, and start doing a good job in summer heat prevention and cooling work as soon as possible. In addition to the existing safety and hygiene organizations and institutions, many factories and mines, such as the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, now have Party committee members specifically responsible for leading employee safety and hygiene work, and some workshop branches also have members specifically in charge of hygiene.

    The Chongqing Municipal Health and Medical Department has carried out investigations and research on the prevention and treatment of scalds and burns, and organized a group of medical personnel to form a burn and scald prevention and treatment working group. On the one hand, they have formed burn prevention and treatment networks according to region and medical resources to carry out rescue and treatment work; on the other hand, they have also sent personnel to factories and mines such as the Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant to closely cooperate with the technical safety departments to investigate and analyze the relevant burn and scald prevention and treatment situation to find effective prevention methods.

    Health workers in many factories and mines and construction sites, such as the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant, and the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, have further established the idea of serving production, and the workshop health work has been greatly strengthened. The health personnel of various factories and mines have put forward the resounding slogans of "bringing medicine to the door" and "where there is production and combat, there are white-clad warriors." These factories and mines often organize mobile medical teams to go deep into the workshops day and night to carry out prevention and treatment. They bandage workers' injuries on the spot and deliver medicines and cool drinks to the workers' mouths. This year, many factories, mines, and construction sites have also increased the number of workshop health stations. The Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant originally had only one health station, but now it has increased to four, and health stations have been set up in high-temperature workshops such as steelmaking, steel rolling, and refractory materials. After the workshop hygiene organization of the No. 1 well of the Tianfu Coal Mine implemented the combination of doctors going down to the work sections and combining early prevention and treatment, the attendance rate of this mine reached as high as 95% every month, and the average absenteeism rate in the first quarter was more than 30% lower than in the same period last year. When the medical staff of several health stations in the steelmaking workshop of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company participated in the labor of attacking sulfur with the workers during the workshop patrol, they found that sulfur was irritating to the mucous membrane of the workers' upper respiratory tract, so they came up with the idea of ​​having the workers wear fragrant wet masks to reduce the irritation of sulfur to the respiratory tract mucosa.

    In terms of heat prevention and cooling, the city-owned factories and mines this year also formulated measures more than a month earlier than in previous years. At present, in addition to inspecting and repairing the original equipment and adding a small amount of necessary equipment, the factories and mines are actively promoting heat prevention and cooling methods.

    In order to mobilize the masses to do their own safety and hygiene work, many factories and mines have also improved the necessary systems and launched a safety production competition. Various factories and mines have successively restored and strengthened the activities of "Safety Activity Day" and "Hygiene Activity Day", and have universally carried out publicity and education on safety production and hygiene knowledge for employees, especially new workers.

    搞好夏季卫生　保证人民健康
    首都保持环境清洁注意食品消毒
    重庆加强医疗预防防止工人伤病
    本报讯　首都人民在“五一”节前开展卫生突击运动的基础上，正积极把除害灭病的各项活动转入经常化。
    目前，早起打扫庭院、扫街泼水已经成为人民群众的生活习惯。就是刮风砂的日子，人们也尽量保持环境整洁。海淀区西直门到颐和园公路两旁的机关、学校等单位职工，利用休息时间清扫了这条长达十多公里的马路。许多饮食行业各店铺都把搞好饮食卫生，作为提高服务质量的主要内容。东城区的饮食业和副食品行业还把“卫生好”做为“五好”竞赛的一项标准。许多饮食店进一步健全卫生组织和制度，改进了食品的加工和保管工作，增添了必要的卫生设备，注意了食品消毒和从业人员的个人卫生。北京饭店严格执行了生吃的瓜果消毒、制作直接入口食物者的手消毒和食具消毒的“三消毒”制度。在开展经常性的卫生工作中，群众还想出了很多办法。天桥鸿兴饺子铺不仅把切生熟食品的刀案严格分开，连放生熟食品的冰箱也有两个。这个饭铺用过的餐具还经过碱水洗、清水洗、煮沸消毒等四道关，入厕先脱工作服，便后洗手已经成为职工们的习惯。北京市防疫站总结了门头沟、周口店等山区农民试验用野生植物藜芦、乌头等消灭蚊蝇的经验，准备推广。
    各城区街道办事处为了保证卫生活动经常化，进一步健全了各种卫生组织，健全了层层负责、分片包干等的街道保洁制度和检查制度等。东城区除建立和巩固各种制度外，还订立了全区定期检查评比制度，以便不断地鼓舞群众学先进赶先进，打下卫生工作经常化的群众基础。
    各区还注意了提高群众的卫生科学知识水平，以巩固既得成绩，不断提高卫生工作质量。目前，各区已组织了许多炊事员、保育员、食品管理员、饲养员、积肥队员等开始学习卫生科学知识，使他们懂得讲卫生的道理，把卫生工作越做越细致。东城区已有街道积极分子、院卫生负责人、保育员、炊事员和饮食副食品行业从业人员二万二千多人在学习卫生科学知识。他们已成为深入开展卫生宣传工作，保证卫生活动经常化的骨干力量。
    本报讯　重庆市今年的厂矿卫生工作特别强调要做到“防病又防伤，重治疗又重预防”，保证工人健康，减少伤病缺勤。
    重庆市是四川重要的钢铁工业基地。去年以来，各厂矿又增加了大量的新工人，其中特别是钢铁、炼焦和铸造等高温车间操作的工人，及露天操作的基本建设工人都增加不少。现在暑季快要到来，中共重庆市委和各厂矿党组织都强调既要抓好生产，又要关心职工的安全和健康，采取措施积极防治烧伤、烫伤，及早抓紧做好夏季防暑降温工作。重庆空气压缩机厂等许多厂矿，除了原有的安全卫生组织与机构以外，今年还有党委委员专门负责领导职工的安全卫生工作，有的车间支部还设有专门领导卫生的委员。
    重庆市卫生医疗部门开展防治烫伤、烧伤的调查研究工作，组织一批医务人员成立烧伤、烫伤防治工作组，一方面按照地区和医疗力量分别组成烧伤防治网进行抢救治疗工作；另一方面又专门派出人员到重庆第三钢铁厂等厂矿，密切配合技术安全部门对有关防治烧伤、烫伤的情况进行了调查分析，找出有效的预防办法。
    重庆钢铁公司、重庆第三钢铁厂、重庆空气压缩机厂等许多厂矿、工地的卫生工作人员，进一步树立了为生产服务的思想，车间保健工作大大加强。各厂矿卫生人员纷纷提出：“医药送上门”和“那里有生产战斗，那里就有白衣战士”的响亮口号。这些厂矿经常组织巡回医疗队，昼夜深入车间进行预防和治疗。他们在现场给工人包扎外伤，把药品和清凉饮料送到工人的口边。今年，许多厂矿、工地还增加了一定数量的车间保健站。重庆第三钢铁厂原来只有一个保健站，现在已增加到四个，炼钢、轧钢和耐火材料等高温车间都设立了保健站。天府煤矿一井的车间卫生机构，实行医生下工段，使早期预防和治疗相结合后，结果这个矿井的出勤率月月高达95％，一季度的缺勤率平均比去年同期降低30％以上。重庆钢铁公司炼钢车间几个保健站的医务人员在车间巡回时与工人一道参加攻硫的劳动后，发现硫磺对工人上呼吸道粘膜有刺激性，就想出让工人戴有香气的湿口罩，减少硫磺对呼吸道粘膜的刺激性。
    在防暑降温方面，各市属厂矿今年也比往年提前一月多订出了措施。目前，除检查、修整原有设备和少量增加必须的设备外，各厂矿都积极推广了防暑降温的办法。
    为了发动群众自己做好安全卫生工作，许多厂矿还健全了必要的制度和展开了安全生产竞赛。各厂矿都先后恢复和加强了“安全活动日”和“卫生活动日”的活动，普遍对职工、特别是新工人展开了安全生产和卫生常识的宣传教育。
