Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 2nd. After a week of meetings, the Consultative Committee of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization closed in Bandung on May 1st. At the last meeting held on the morning of May 1st, the draft of the new charter of the organization, drafted by the drafting committee, was discussed. The draft charter stipulates that member states of the organization must be limited to countries whose capitals are located in the Afro-Asian region. The Chinese delegation firmly opposed this decision at the closing meeting. The Iraqi delegation expressed reservations on this issue, while the United Arab Republic delegation suggested that no decision be made on this issue, and that these two divergent opinions be submitted to the next meeting of the Consultative Committee for discussion. The Sudanese delegation also agreed with the suggestion of the United Arab Republic delegation. Pakistan, Indonesia, India, Japan and two other countries insisted that the majority opinion must be taken as the decision. Therefore, the Chinese delegation had to announce its reservations. The full text of the Chinese delegation's statement is as follows:

Chinese Delegation Statement - Dr. Ji Chaoding opposes the majority opinion of the Consultative Committee on restricting the membership of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization.

Since the majority of the countries in the committee rejected my repeated requests to postpone the decision on this important issue of member state regulations, I feel very sorry. I have to announce my reservations and state that the Chinese delegation firmly opposes this illegal, unfair and unreasonable decision. The article on member states in the new draft charter actually excludes a country that participated in the Cairo meeting in December 1958 to establish the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization. This new draft charter stipulates that member states of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization must be limited to "Afro-Asian countries that participated in the Bandung Afro-Asian Conference in 1955 and countries that have gained independence after this conference, as well as all other independent sovereign states whose central governments are located in the Afro-Asian region."

I firmly believe that taking this action is completely unjustified, illegal, unreasonable and violates the Bandung spirit. Submitting this provision to the next meeting for discussion without attempting to consult with a relevant country makes this action appear prominently unfriendly.

First, the countries that participated in the Cairo meeting are the founders of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization. Therefore, they are the de facto members of this newly established organization. The task of the Consultative Committee is to draft a draft charter for this already established organization. It has absolutely no right to include provisions restricting member states in the draft charter. This provision actually excludes a founding country of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization from this organization. Thus, the Consultative Committee's approach is ultra vires, and therefore illegal and non-binding.

Second, as the Cairo resolution establishing this organization clearly states, the driving force behind the establishment of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization is the common desire of Afro-Asian countries to promote economic cooperation between them. This desire is expressed in the Bandung Conference and other Afro-Asian countries' meetings. Afro-Asian countries work together under the common principles of "living together peacefully" and "friendly cooperation." This clearly means that as many Afro-Asian countries as possible should participate in this organization, regardless of their differences in socio-economic systems. To try to use any excuse to restrict membership and exclude a country that has already made very valuable contributions to the future Afro-Asian economy is a major violation of the Bandung spirit. The fact that such a country has participated in the Cairo meeting as a formal member state - it established the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization - and has participated in many other Afro-Asian national meetings and organizations as a formal member state is clear evidence that it is generally recognized as an Asian country. Therefore, any attempt to prevent this Asian country from participating in the work of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization is a violation of the common interests and common aspirations of the Afro-Asian people for peaceful cooperation. This attempt to discriminate against an Asian country will only please those interest groups who hope to divide us and weaken our cooperative efforts, and will sadden those who sincerely hope for Afro-Asian unity and cooperation.

Making such a decision in Bandung would damage Bandung's good reputation. Bandung is a symbol of peaceful cooperation, and this symbol should not be turned into a milestone of unjust discrimination. In view of the above reasons, for the benefit of Afro-Asian cooperation, and in accordance with the spirit of consultation and reconciliation, I sincerely hope that the members of the Consultative Committee and other member states that established the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization in Cairo will further consider this issue, and discuss the issue openly at the next Consultative Committee meeting, and if necessary at the next meeting. (End of full text of statement)

The Consultative Committee of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization issued a press release on the afternoon of the 1st. The communique said that the committee, among other things, adopted part of the organization's charter (including the criteria for admitting members), and recommended that the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization meeting scheduled to be held sometime in December this year adopt this part of the charter. The press release also said that the remaining part of the charter will be finalized at the next meeting tentatively scheduled to be held in Karachi.

The Indonesian delegation also issued a brief statement to the press through Subhan, chairman of the Indonesian General Chamber of Commerce. The statement said that the Indonesian delegation disagreed with the Chinese delegation's statement and could not agree with this attitude. He said that given that "nine" of the ten member states of the Consultative Committee attending the meeting agreed with the resolution on membership of the Afro-Asian Economic Cooperation Organization, the Chinese delegation's attitude "is completely incomprehensible."

In fact, not only the Chinese delegation but also some other delegations did not support this resolution.

### 亚非经济合作组织不能排斥亚非国家  协商委员会的非法决定违背万隆精神  我国代表团发表声明表示坚决反对

    亚非经济合作组织不能排斥亚非国家
    协商委员会的非法决定违背万隆精神
    我国代表团发表声明表示坚决反对
    新华社雅加达2日电　亚非经济合作组织协商委员会经过一个星期的会议以后，于1日在万隆闭幕。在1日上午举行的最后一次会议上，讨论了起草委员会起草的这个组织的新章程草案。章程草案规定，这个组织的会员国必须限于首都设在亚非地区的国家。中国代表团在闭幕会上坚决反对这个决定。伊拉克代表团表示保留在这个问题上的态度，阿联代表团则建议不要在这个问题上作出决定，而把这两个分歧的意见交由下一次的协商委员会会议讨论。苏丹代表团也同意阿联代表团的建议。巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、印度、日本和其它两个国家坚持认为，必须把多数的意见作为决定。因此中国代表团不得不宣布保留它的态度。中国代表团的声明全文如下：
    中国代表团声明——冀朝鼎博士反对协商委员会关于限制亚非经济合作组织的会员国的多数意见。
    既然委员会的多数国家拒绝了我的关于推迟对会员国规定这个重要问题作出决定的再三要求，我感到很遗憾。我不得不宣布保留我的态度，并且表明中国代表团坚决反对这种非法的、不公平的和不合理的决定。新章程草案关于会员国的条款实际上排斥了一个参加1958年12月成立亚非经济合作组织的开罗会议的国家。这个新章程草案规定，亚非经济合作组织的会员国必须限于“1955年参加万隆亚非会议的亚非国家和在这次会议以后取得独立的国家，以及中央政府设在亚非地区的其它一切独立的主权国家。”
    我坚信，采取这种行动是完全没有正当理由的，是不合法的、不合理的和违背万隆精神的。把这个规定交给下一次会议讨论而不设法同一个有关国家协商，这种做法使这个行动显得突出地非常不友好。
    第一，参加开罗会议的国家是亚非经济合作组织的创建者。因此，它们是这个新成立的组织的实际上的会员国。协商委员会的任务是为这个已经成立的组织起草章程草案。它绝对没有权利把限制会员国的规定列入章程草案。这个规定实际上是把亚非经济合作组织的一个创建国排斥在这个组织之外。这样，协商委员会的做法是越权的，因而是不合法的，是没有约束力的。
    第二，正如建立这个组织的开罗决议明确说明的，成立亚非经济合作组织的推动力是亚非国家要促进它们之间经济合作的共同愿望。这种愿望表现在万隆会议和其他亚非国家的会议之中。亚非国家在“和平地在一起生活”和“友好合作”的共同原则下一起工作。这显然意味着，应当使尽可能多的亚非国家——不管它们在社会经济制度方面的不同——参加这个组织。要想利用任何借口来限制会员资格，来排斥一个已经对未来的亚非经济作出非常宝贵的贡献的国家，那是对万隆精神的重大违反。这样一个国家已以正式成员国的身份参加过开罗会议——它建立了亚非经济合作组织——，已以正式成员国的身份参加过其他许多亚非国家会议和组织，这一事实是普遍承认它是一个亚洲国家的明显证据。因此，要想阻止这个亚洲国家参加亚非经济合作组织工作的任何企图是违反亚非国家人民关于和平合作的共同利益和共同愿望的。这种要想歧视一个亚洲国家的企图，只会使那些希望分裂我们和削弱我们合作的努力的利益集团高兴，而使那些诚恳希望亚非团结和合作的人感到痛心。
    在万隆作出这样一个决定会损害万隆的好名声。万隆是和平合作的象征，不应该把这种象征变成为不公正的歧视的里程碑。鉴于上述理由，为了亚非合作的利益，并且按照协商与和解的精神，我衷心地希望，协商委员会的委员和在开罗建立亚非经济合作组织的其他会员国将进一步考虑这个问题，并且把问题摊开来在下一次协商委员会会议上作进一步的讨论，如果有必要的话在下一次会议上讨论。（声明全文完）
    亚非经济合作组织协商委员会1日下午发表了一项新闻公报。公报说，委员会除了其他事项以外通过了这个组织章程的一部分（其中包括接纳会员的标准），并且建议预定在今年12月的某个时候开会的亚非经济合作组织会议通过这一部分章程。这项新闻公报还说，章程的其余部分将在暂定在卡拉奇举行的下一次会议上最后拟成。
    印度尼西亚代表团还通过印度尼西亚总商会主席苏布汉向新闻界发表了一项简短的声明。这项声明说，印度尼西亚代表团不同意中国代表团的声明，并且不能同意这种态度。他说，鉴于参加会议的协商委员会十个会员国中的“九个”国家同意关于亚非经济合作组织会员资格的决议，中国代表团的态度“是完全不能理解的”。
    实际上，不仅中国代表团而且其他一些代表团也不支持这项决议。
