A New Stage of Friendly Cooperation Between China and Hungary

The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation headed by Premier Münnich Ferencz paid a friendly visit to our country for ten days and received a warm welcome from the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the people of various regions. During the visit, the Party and Government leaders of China and Hungary held cordial talks on international issues of mutual concern, the socialist construction of the two countries, and the issue of further expanding friendly cooperation between China and Hungary and between the two parties. Based on the complete agreement of opinions between the two sides, the Premiers of the two countries signed the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation on behalf of their respective governments. The visit of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation and the signing of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship and Cooperation Treaty mark a new stage in the brotherly friendly cooperation between China and Hungary. This is something well worth celebrating.

The people of China and Hungary, following the path of the great October Socialist Revolution, have forged a profound and militant friendship in the long-term common revolutionary struggle. After liberation, this friendship has undergone tremendous development under new conditions. In the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, common ideals and common interests closely unite us, and the friendship between the people of China and Hungary, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. We support each other in the common struggle against the enemy and assist each other in the cause of socialist construction. The mutual visits of Chinese and Hungarian leaders and the extensive development of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries have greatly promoted the understanding and unity between the two peoples, promoted the prosperity of the two countries' economies and cultures, and accelerated the socialist construction of the two countries. The signing of this Sino-Hungarian Friendship and Cooperation Treaty further solidifies the brotherly friendly cooperative relationship between our two countries in the form of a treaty. The continuous consolidation and development of friendly cooperation between China and Hungary not only strengthens the strength of our two countries but also strengthens the strength of the entire socialist camp and the forces of world peace.

To continuously consolidate and develop the friendly cooperative relations between China and Hungary so as to make greater contributions in the struggle to defend world peace and safeguard the security of the people of Europe and Asia is the sacred duty and common desire of our two peoples. The Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation explicitly stipulates that "the contracting parties will, in the spirit of sincere cooperation and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, participate in all international actions aimed at safeguarding world peace and the security of all peoples." "The contracting parties will, in the spirit of fraternal cooperation, conduct consultations on all important international issues of concern to both countries, and in such consultations, special attention will be paid to ensuring the territorial integrity and security of both countries." "The contracting parties reaffirm their determination to continue to consolidate and develop political, economic, and cultural cooperative relations between the two countries in the spirit of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit." All this shows that the signing of the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and the further consolidation and development of friendly cooperation relations between China and Hungary not only conform to the interests of the people of China and Hungary but also conform to the interests of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Today, the people of China and Hungary are advancing victoriously on the road of socialist construction with great enthusiasm and heroic spirit. The further consolidation and development of the friendly cooperative relations between the people of China and Hungary will enable us to reach our common goals—socialism and communism—faster, and will enable us to make greater contributions to the cause of world peace and human progress.

　　中匈友好合作的新阶段
    以明尼赫·费伦茨总理为首的匈牙利党政代表团在我国进行了十天的友好访问，受到中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和各地人民的热情欢迎。在访问期间，中匈两国的党政领导人就双方关心的国际问题、两国社会主义建设的情况以及进一步扩大中匈两国和两党友好合作关系问题进行了恳切的会谈。在双方意见完全一致的基础上，两国总理代表两国政府签订了中匈友好合作条约。匈牙利党政代表团的访问和中匈友好合作条约的签订，标志着中匈两国兄弟般的友好合作进入了一个新的阶段。这是十分值得庆贺的事情。
    中匈两国人民沿着伟大十月社会主义革命的道路，在长期的共同的革命斗争中结成了深厚的战斗友谊。两国人民在获得解放后，这种友谊在新的条件下有了巨大的发展。在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，共同的思想和共同的利益把我们紧密地团结在一起，建筑在无产阶级国际主义基础上的中匈两国人民的友谊日益巩固和发展。我们在反对敌人的共同斗争中互相支持，在建设社会主义的事业中互相援助。中匈两国领导人的互相访问，两国经济和文化合作的广泛发展，大大促进了两国人民的了解和团结，促进了两国经济和文化的繁荣，加快了两国社会主义建设。这次中匈友好合作条约的签订，进一步使我们两国的兄弟般的友好合作关系用条约的形式固定下来。中匈两国友好合作的不断巩固和发展，不仅加强了我们两国的力量，而且加强了整个社会主义阵营的力量和世界和平的力量。
    不断巩固和发展中匈两国的友好合作关系，以便在保卫世界和平，保卫欧洲和亚洲各国人民安全的斗争中作出更多更大的贡献，是我们两国人民的神圣职责和共同愿望。在中匈友好合作条约中明文规定了“缔约双方将本着真诚合作的精神，并且在符合联合国宪章原则下，参加一切旨在维护世界和平和各国人民的安全的国际行动”。“缔约双方将本着兄弟般的合作精神，就两国关心的一切重要的国际问题进行磋商，在磋商中，将特别注意保障两国的领土完整和安全”。“缔约双方重申决心，将本着互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政、平等互利的原则，继续巩固和发展两国的政治、经济和文化合作关系。”所有这些都表明，中匈友好合作条约的签订，中匈两国友好合作关系的进一步巩固和发展，不仅符合于中匈两国人民的利益，而且符合以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的利益。
    今天，中匈两国人民正以巨大的热情和英勇的气概，在建设社会主义的道路上胜利前进。中匈两国人民的友好合作关系的进一步巩固和发展，将使我们更快地达到我们共同的目标——社会主义和共产主义，将使我们对世界和平和人类进步事业作出更多更大的贡献。
