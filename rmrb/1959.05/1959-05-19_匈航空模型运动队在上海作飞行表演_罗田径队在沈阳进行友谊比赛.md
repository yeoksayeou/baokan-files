Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th: The Hungarian aeromodelling team of six athletes performed a wonderful aeromodelling flight show for over 20,000 spectators in Shanghai today.

The athletes performed a total of seven events, including various model aircraft racing, stunts, and aerial combat. The all-Hungarian stunt champion Egerwari and Oldorg piloted their model aircraft to perform many beautiful stunts, sometimes flying upside down close to the ground, sometimes doing continuous somersaults in the air. Egerwari also demonstrated two of the world's newest maneuvers: the triangular somersault and the "four-leaf rose." Generally, controlled aircraft models can do circular somersaults, but triangular somersaults require right-angle maneuvers, and the "four-leaf rose" involves controlling the aircraft model to fly around the operator's head in a four-lobed circular pattern. These superb and skilled manipulation techniques repeatedly received warm applause and praise from the audience.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 18th: Romanian world record holder in women's high jump, Balas, once again cleared a height of 1.80 meters in Shenyang today, winning enthusiastic praise from more than 13,000 Chinese spectators.

The Romanian national men's and women's track and field teams held a friendly match with the Liaoning men's and women's track and field teams in Shenyang today. As a result, the men's team won first place in nine out of ten events. Tong Zuolin of the Liaoning men's track and field team took first place in the 200 meters with a time of 22.3 seconds. The Romanian women's track and field team won first place in six out of eight events. Liaoning female track and field athletes Liu Yuying and Shi Baozhu won first place in the 80-meter low hurdles and discus with scores of 11.5 seconds and 44.55 meters, respectively.

The most eye-catching event was the women's high jump. Romanian meritorious athlete Balas only began to try jumping after the Liaoning female athletes had cleared their highest heights. In her first attempt, Balas easily cleared the bar at 1.60 meters. After she cleared 1.70 meters in her second attempt, the bar was immediately raised by 10 centimeters to 1.80 meters. Balas cleared it again with a leap.

    罗田径队在沈阳进行友谊比赛
    据新华社上海19日电　匈牙利航空模型运动队六位运动员，今天在上海为两万多观众作了一场精彩的航空模型飞行表演。
    运动员们一共表演了各式模型飞机竞速、特技和空战等七个项目。全匈特技冠军埃格尔瓦利和奥尔多格操纵的模型飞机做了许多优美的特技姿态，一忽儿贴近地面地倒飞，一忽儿在空中连续翻筋斗，埃格尔瓦利还表演了两种世界上的最新项目：翻三角筋斗和“四叶玫瑰”。经操纵的飞机模型一般都能翻圆形筋斗，可是翻三角筋斗需作直角操纵，“四叶玫瑰”是控制飞机模型在操纵者头顶上空围绕飞行作四瓣圆叶状，这些高超纯熟的操纵技术一再受到了观众们热烈的鼓掌称赞。
    据新华社沈阳18日电　罗马尼亚的女子跳高世界纪录保持者巴拉斯，今天在沈阳再一次跳过了一公尺八十公分的高度，博得了一万三千多名中国观众的热烈赞扬。
    罗马尼亚国家男、女田径队今天在沈阳同辽宁男、女田径队举行了友谊比赛，结果，男子队在十项比赛中，取得了九项第一名，辽宁男子田径队的佟作林以二十二秒三的成绩取得了二百公尺的第一名。罗马尼亚女子田径队在八项比赛中，赢得了六项第一名，辽宁女田径选手刘玉英和石宝珠分别以十一秒五和四十四公尺五十五公分的成绩，获得了八十公尺低栏和铁饼的第一名。
    最引人注意的是女子跳高比赛。罗马尼亚功勋运动员巴拉斯在辽宁的女选手们跳过她们的最高高度后，才开始试跳。第一次试跳，巴拉斯就轻轻越过一公尺六十公分的横竿。当她第二次又跳过了一公尺七十公分以后，横竿一下子就升高了十公分，达到一公尺八十公分。巴拉斯又是一跃而过。
