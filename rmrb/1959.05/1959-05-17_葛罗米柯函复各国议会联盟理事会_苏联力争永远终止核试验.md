Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th (TASS): Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, in reply to a letter from the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, stated that the Soviet Union has consistently been committed to the permanent and universal cessation of nuclear weapons tests, i.e., in the atmosphere, underground, underwater, and at high altitudes. Gromyko also said that the Soviet delegation is striving to resolve the issue in this way.

Gromyko was replying to an appeal from the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to the Geneva Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests. The appeal hoped that the participants in the Geneva Conference would make every effort to reach an agreement in the near future on prohibiting the testing of atomic weapons under effective supervision.

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet delegation participating in the Geneva Conference was instructed to put forward a proposal regarding the dispatch of inspection teams to conduct on-site investigations of suspicious nuclear explosion phenomena. The Soviet Foreign Minister said that this proposal was drafted based on the views expressed by British Prime Minister Macmillan in Moscow. If it could obtain the support of other participants in the talks, it would clear the way for reaching an agreement on the cessation of all types of nuclear weapons tests, which would be a valuable contribution to solving the task facing the conference.

    葛罗米柯函复各国议会联盟理事会
    苏联力争永远终止核试验
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯复信各国议会联盟理事会，声明苏联一贯致力于永远和普遍地，即在大气中、在地下、在水下和在高空中终止核武器试验。葛罗米柯还说，苏联代表团正是在争取这样来解决这个问题。
    葛罗米柯是答复各国议会联盟理事会向日内瓦不继续核武器试验会议发出的呼吁书的。呼吁书希望，日内瓦会议的参加者尽一切努力在最近达成关于在有效的监督下禁止试验原子武器的协议。
    葛罗米柯指出，参加日内瓦会议的苏联代表团得到指示，提出关于派遣视察团就地调查核爆炸可疑现象的问题的建议。苏联外交部长说，这个建议是根据英国首相麦克米伦在莫斯科所表示的看法来拟定的，如果它能得到会谈其他参加者的支持，那么这样就会为达成关于停止试验各种核武器的协议扫清道路，而这就会是对解决会议面临的任务的一个宝贵贡献。
