    Let the Facts Speak for Themselves
    In Prime Minister Nehru's speech to the Indian People's Assembly, he asserted that the Chinese people's condemnation of the words and deeds of certain Indian politicians who interfered in China's internal affairs was "disregarding the truth and etiquette," and was "both inappropriate and completely unfounded." Mr. Nehru here raised an important key point – facts. Indeed, as long as we respect the facts, the problem will be easily clarified. However, who is it that does not respect the facts?
    Let the facts speak for themselves!
    Are the three letters Dalai Lama wrote to General Tan Guansan genuine? Mr. Nehru doubted, was surprised, and finally had to admit that they were indeed genuine. Let's not dwell on why Nehru didn't know these letters were real during the 24 days the Dalai Lama entered India – was it intentional ignorance, or did he know but not speak out, letting the reactionary Indian press slander us? Since he later admitted that the letters were real, then the Dalai Lama's statement in the letters that he was "obstructed" and "harmed" by "reactionaries" who were "opposed to the revolution," and that his "life was in danger," leaves no room for doubt. The logic of the facts inevitably leads to the conclusion that the Dalai Lama was kidnapped by reactionaries. If he was kidnapped, then how could the two so-called "statements by the Dalai Lama" be his own words? Admitting this fact is certainly an "unpleasant fact," but it is, after all, a fact. However, Mr. Nehru slipped past this "fact." Thinking and guessing, the result became that the Dalai Lama "voluntarily" went to India, and the so-called Dalai statements became truly his own.
  “Fact” is one, but the conclusions are completely opposite! I don’t want to say that Mr. Nehru “disregards obvious facts,” but at least I can say that the original “facts” are powerless in front of some people, or that Mr. Nehru’s logic is different from the logic of facts.
    As for the conspiracy and ambition of certain Indian politicians to frantically interfere in our internal affairs, it is now "Sima Zhao's heart, known to all passers-by." Leaders of the Indian People's Socialist Party such as Mehta and Narayan instigated the submission of the Tibet issue to some United Nations, "announcing in unison (shouting) that Tibet should be an independent country"; Upadhyaya, Secretary-General of the Indian People's League, openly wanted to send "volunteers" to Tibet to participate in some "fight for freedom against the Chinese," as well as the voluminous slanders, intimidations, coercions, and abuses of the Chinese people by many reactionary Indian newspapers in recent months, and so on. Mr. Nehru must be clearer about these Indian words and actions than we are. "Black and white, even God cannot change it!"
    However, when Mr. Nehru accuses the Chinese people of "disregarding the facts," he does not see the facts within India, or even if he sees them, he still insists that these are not interference in China's internal affairs, and beautifies them as "compassion for humanitarian reasons," "close feelings based on long-standing religious and cultural ties with the Tibetan people" and "instinctive reactions." "Obvious facts" have fully exposed the faces of the interferers. Why does Mr. Nehru disregard such facts?
    Let’s take a look at what they are sympathizing with. It is nothing more than the failure of the rebellion of the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet. And the backward, reactionary, cruel, and barbaric rule of the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet over the Tibetan people is a bloody and cruel fact known to all. Why do you express deep "humanitarian sympathy" for the failure of those Tibetan rebellious elements whose crimes are "greater than the sky, denser than the stars, longer than the river, and deeper than the sea"? Why do you have such deep "feelings" for the impending collapse of the "backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system in the Tibetan region," but you don’t have a bit of "humanitarian sympathy" and "close feelings" for the vast Tibetan people who have suffered disasters and pain? If there is no ulterior motive, this is difficult to understand.

### 让事实来说话吧

    让事实来说话吧
    尼赫鲁总理在印度人民院的讲演中，一口咬定中国人民对印度某些政治家干涉中国内政的言行的谴责，是“不顾事实真相和礼节”，“既不适当又完全没有根据”。尼赫鲁先生在这里提出了一个重要的关键——事实。的确，只要尊重事实，问题就容易澄清了。然而，到底是谁不尊重事实呢？
    还是让事实来说话吧！
    达赖喇嘛写给谭冠三将军的三封信，是真是假？尼赫鲁先生怀疑过，惊讶过，最后又不得不承认确有其事。且不追究在达赖喇嘛进入印度的二十四天中尼赫鲁为什么不知道这些信件是真实的，是故意不闻不问，还是明明知道而不说出，一任印度的反动报刊诬蔑我们。既然事后承认信件是真实的，那么，达赖喇嘛在信中说他被“反对革命”的“反动分子”所“阻拦”，所“危害”，大有“生命难保”之势，也就是不容丝毫怀疑的了。事实的逻辑必然要得出达赖喇嘛被反动分子劫持的结论。既然被劫持，那末，两次的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，又怎么可能是他自己的话呢？承认这个事实，固然是一件“难堪的事实”，但毕竟是事实。可是尼赫鲁先生却从这一“事实”旁边滑了过去。一想，一猜，结果变成了达赖喇嘛“自愿”地到印度去了，所谓达赖声明也变成真是他自己发表的了。
  “事实”是一个，结论却截然相反！我不愿说尼赫鲁先生“不顾明显的事实”，但至少可以说，原来“事实”在有些人的面前是无能为力的，或者说尼赫鲁先生的逻辑同事实的逻辑是不同的。
    至于说到印度某些政治家疯狂干涉我国内政的阴谋和野心，现在已是“司马昭之心，路人皆知”的了。梅达、纳拉扬等印度人民社会党领袖策动把西藏问题提交什么联合国，“异口同声地宣布（叫嚣）西藏应当是独立的国家”；印度人民同盟总书记乌帕德亚亚公然要派“志愿军”到西藏参加什么“反对中国人的争取自由的战斗”，以及近月来印度许多反动报刊连篇累牍地对中国人民的诬蔑、威吓、要挟、叫骂，如此等等印度人的言论和行动，想必尼赫鲁先生比我们还清楚些。“白纸黑字，神力难移”啊！
    可是，尼赫鲁先生在指责中国人民“不顾事实”的时候，却看不到印度国内的事实，或者虽然看到了却仍然硬说这些不是对中国内政的干涉，并且把它们美化为“人道原因的同情”，“基于同西藏人民久远的宗教和文化联系所造成的亲密感情和“本能的反应”。“明摆着的事实”已经充分暴露了干涉者的嘴脸。尼赫鲁先生为什么又不顾这样的事实呢？
    再看一看他们同情的究竟是什么呢？只不过是西藏上层反动集团的叛乱的失败。而西藏上层反动集团对西藏人民的落后的、反动的、残酷的、野蛮的统治，是大家都知道的血淋淋的残酷的事实。为什么你们对于那些罪恶“比天大、比星密、比河长、比海深”的西藏叛乱分子的失败要深表“人道原因的同情”，为什么你们对“藏族地区落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度”的行将崩溃有着那样深厚的“感情”，而对于广大的受尽了灾难和痛苦的西藏人民却没有一点“人道的同情”和“亲密感情”呢？如果不是别有用心，这是很难令人理解的。
