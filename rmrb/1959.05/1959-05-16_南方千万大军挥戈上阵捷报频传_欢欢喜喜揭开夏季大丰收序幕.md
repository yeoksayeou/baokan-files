According to Sichuan Daily, small spring crops in Sichuan Province are generally ripe and entering the intense harvest stage. The harvesting work in the vast areas along the Yangtze River has formed a climax, and the harvesting work in the slightly later western Sichuan Plain has also generally begun. According to incomplete statistics as of the 8th, the province has harvested 1.78 million mu of wheat, 2.82 million mu of rapeseed, and more than 7 million mu of peas and broad beans, with the harvested area accounting for more than 10% to 60% of the sown area of various crops.

The vast fields of Sichuan Province present a scene of great harvest; in many areas, wheat ears are long and grains are full, rapeseed pods are heavy and numerous, and pea and broad bean pods are large and dense. With the rise of sickles, good news is constantly reported. Xichang Prefecture, located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has harvested more than 38,000 mu of wheat and more than 67,000 mu of broad beans. Mabian County, a mountainous area, has harvested about 7,000 mu of early rapeseed, and after drying and typical acceptance calculation, the average yield per mu reached 230 jin, an increase of 270% compared with the last year's yield of 62 jin per mu.

The broad masses of commune members in the people's communes are harvesting with tension and joy, encouraged by the great harvest of small spring crops. People in Neijiang Prefecture harvested more than 150,000 mu of peas, more than 70,000 mu of broad beans, and about 20,000 mu of rapeseed in just four or five days. Weiyuan County adopted the method of planting seedlings, deep plowing the land, sowing seeds during the day, and rushing to harvest small spring crops early in the morning and late at night, ensuring the simultaneous harvesting and planting. Within four days, the county harvested more than 50,000 mu of peas and broad beans. Party committees at all levels in the Luzhou area properly arranged the labor force and formed professional teams and shock teams to rush to harvest small spring crops, accelerating the harvesting progress and ensuring the harvesting quality. When harvesting small spring crops this year, Shishi People's Commune in Fushun County summarized the experience of harvesting last year and specially formulated four covenants, namely: harvest the yellow first without waiting, select seeds while harvesting without mixing, harvest and store carefully without discarding, and manage by special personnel without arbitrary use, so that the harvest of small spring crops is orderly.

In order to ensure a full harvest and return of grains to the granary, many people's communes have paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing to avoid and reduce discarding. Many areas in Nanchong Prefecture have mobilized the masses to establish and improve the collection responsibility system. People's communes in Guang'an County have launched a campaign to harvest ten more jin of grain per mu; in this way, the county's 500,000 mu of small spring crops can yield an additional 5 million jin of grain.

According to Fujian Daily, wheat and rapeseed in Fujian Province have achieved a great harvest.

As of the statistics of May 1, the province has harvested more than 790,000 mu of wheat, accounting for 59.7% of the planted area. At present, the wheat harvest in southern Fujian has basically ended, and other areas are still continuing to harvest.

In northern Fujian, the main producing area of rapeseed in Fujian Province, more than 67,000 mu of the area's 97,000 mu of spring rapeseed has been harvested. According to reports from the three counties of Jian'ou, Pucheng, and Jianyang, among the more than 12,000 mu of rapeseed that have been harvested, there are 109 mu with a yield of more than 200 jin per mu, and 51 mu with more than 300 jin per mu. In particular, the increase in production is more significant in some experimental fields that have implemented deep plowing, reasonable close planting, and increased fertilizer application.

In the harvesting of wheat and rapeseed, various places have tried their best to harvest carefully and ensure a bumper harvest. Many people's communes have also implemented the policy of "self-retention, self-selection, self-use" to leave more and better seeds for wheat in winter this year.

The great harvest of small spring crops has brought tremendous encouragement to the broad masses of commune members in various places, further enhancing their confidence in striving for a continued leap forward in grain production this year. The members of Zhulian Production Team of Hushi Commune in Putian, who obtained an average yield of 358 jin per mu of wheat, were all overjoyed and determined to absorb the experience of wheat production, especially the experience of reasonable close planting, and make persistent efforts to win a great summer harvest and welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

According to the New Hunan Daily, in the fields of Shaodong County, Hunan Province, golden waves are rippling in the fields, and more than 20,000 mu of barley and 70,000 mu of wheat have matured and are being harvested one after another. By May 10, all people's communes in the county had harvested more than 25,000 mu, and the entire harvest can be completed in mid-month.

In order to make preparations for winning the first harvest battle this year and ensure that the fruits of the harvest are returned to the granary, the CPC Shaodong County Committee studied the work of wheat production and harvest at the county party committee enlarged meeting in mid-April. Before the harvest, all communes convened cadre meetings and mass meetings, and educated commune members not to lose a grain of the harvest by carefully calculating accounts. At the same time, all communes also specifically studied the technical measures for careful harvesting to ensure that wheat is not lost in the five stages of cutting, transporting, drying, threshing, and storing. The methods they have established are: cutting, to cut quickly and gently, and the dropped ears of wheat should be picked up by children; transporting, be careful not to drop wheat grains on the way, and put them down gently when they are transported to the threshing ground; drying, put them on the threshing ground for one or two days before threshing, so that it is easy to thresh and clean; threshing, the threshing should be done in a bucket, surrounded by a screen, and the threshing should be done lightly first and then heavily, and if there are inverted ears on the threshed wheat bundles, they should be picked off, and those that have not been threshed cleanly should be re-threshed; storing, they must be dried and cleaned before they can be put into the warehouse to prevent mold and deterioration.

According to Hubei Daily, 50,000 mu of rapeseed in Echeng County, Hubei Province has achieved a large-scale harvest, and it has now been basically harvested.

Before the harvest, the CPC Echeng County Committee issued instructions to various places on the quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick selling, and quick oil extraction of rapeseed, requiring various places to do a good job in the careful harvesting, threshing, and returning of grains to the granary. The 64 production teams in the Dengta Management Area of Bishidu Commune have 42 teams that have freed up houses for rain protection during the rush harvest, and other teams have also prepared enough pillows and bedding and other rain protection equipment. In order to achieve grain return, they put forward the slogan "cut every stubble cleanly, tie every piece into bundles, thresh every bundle thoroughly, and return every grain to the granary." Now they have put forward the three diligence measures of "diligent threshing, diligent sweeping, and diligent drying," and have arranged more than 240 semi-laborers and female laborers to rush to thresh.

In order to have higher yields next year, seed selection and retention were generally carried out in various places before the harvest. Most of the production teams selected seeds by the plant. Twenty-eight of the thirty-one production teams in the Donggang Management Area selected, threshed, dried, and stored seeds separately. All the seeds in the second production team of the Xinmiao Management Area were concentrated in the high-yield experimental field for weeding and refining. (Attached picture)

    南方千万大军挥戈上阵捷报频传
    欢欢喜喜揭开夏季大丰收序幕
    据四川日报消息　四川省小春作物普遍黄熟，进入收获的紧张阶段。沿长江的广大地区抢收工作形成高潮，季节稍迟的川西平原收获工作也普遍开始。截至8日的不完全统计，全省已收割小麦一百七十八万亩、油菜二百八十二万亩、豌、胡豆七百多万亩，已收面积分别达到各类作物播种面积的10％多至60％多。
    四川省广阔的田野上，呈现着一片大丰收的景象；不少地区小麦穗长粒饱，油菜结荚累累，豌、胡豆角又大又密。镰刀起处，捷报频传。地处长江上游的西昌专区，已经收割了三万八千多亩小麦、六万七千多亩胡豆。山区马边县已经收获的约七千亩早油菜，经过晒干风净和典型验收计算，平均亩产达二百三十斤，比去年亩产六十二斤净增270％。
    各地人民公社的广大社员，在小春大丰收的鼓舞下，紧张欢乐地进行着收割。内江专区人民仅四五天时间就抢收了豌豆十五万多亩、胡豆七万多亩、油菜二万亩左右。威远县采取白天栽秧、深翻土地、播种和一早一晚突击抢收小春的办法，保证了抢收和抢种的同时进行，四天内，全县就收割了五万多亩豌胡豆。泸州地区各级党委妥善地安排了劳动力并组成专业队和突击队抢收小春，加快了收割进度，保证了收割质量。富顺县狮市人民公社今年收割小春时，总结了去年收割的经验，专门制订了四项公约，即：先黄先打不等待，边收边选种不混杂，精收细藏不抛撒，专人管理不随意动用，使小春收割得有条有理。
    为了保证丰产全收、颗粒还仓，许多人民公社都注意精收细打，避免和减少抛撒。南充专区许多地区发动群众建立和健全了收藏责任制。广安县各人民公社都开展了每亩多收十斤粮的运动；这样，全县五十万亩小春，就可多收五百万斤粮食。
    据福建日报消息　福建省大小麦和油菜获得了大丰收。
    至5月1日的统计，全省已收割大小麦七十九万多亩，占种植面积的59.7％。目前，闽南地区的麦收已基本结束，其他地区还在继续收割。
    福建省油菜主要产地的闽北，全区九万七千多亩春收油菜，已收割六万七千多亩。据建瓯、浦城、建阳三个县了解，在已收割的一万二千多亩油菜中，亩产二百斤以上的有一百零九亩，三百斤以上的有五十一亩。特别是一些执行深翻土、合理密植、增施肥料较好的试验田，增产更为显著。
    各地在收割大小麦和油菜中，想尽一切办法精打细收，保证丰产丰收。许多人民公社还贯彻“自留、自选、自用”的方针，为今年冬种大小麦留下更多更好的种子。
    小春作物的大丰收给各地广大社员带来了巨大的鼓舞，进一步增强了争取今年粮食生产继续大跃进的信心。获得小麦平均亩产三百五十八斤的莆田笏石公社珠联生产队的社员们，个个欢欣鼓舞，决心吸取小麦丰产经验，特别是合理密植的经验，再接再厉，夺取夏季大丰收，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    据新湖南报消息　湖南省邵东县的田野上，满垅金波荡漾，二万多亩大麦和七万亩小麦都已成熟，相继开镰收割。全县各人民公社，到5月10日止，已经收割二万五千多亩，月中即可全部抢收完毕。
    为了有准备地打好今年第一个丰收仗，保证丰收果实颗粒还家，中共邵东县委在4月中旬的县委扩大会议上，就研究了麦子丰产丰收工作。收割前，各公社召开了干部会、群众会，通过算细账的方法，教育社员不丢失一粒丰收粮。同时，各公社又具体研究了细打细收的技术措施，保证小麦在割、运、晒、打、藏五个环节上不受损失。他们订出的办法是：割，要快割轻放，有脱掉的麦穗由小孩跟着检净；运，在途中当心不挂脱麦粒，运到打麦场时要轻放；晒，放在打麦场上晒一、二天才打，这样容易脱粒、打净；打，打麦要放在扮桶内，围上拦簟，打时先轻后重，打后的麦捆如有倒穗要摘下来，未打干净的要进行复打；藏，要晒燥车净才准入仓，杜绝霉坏。
    据湖北日报消息　湖北省鄂城县五万亩油菜获得大面积丰收，现在已基本收割完毕。
    在收割前，中共鄂城县委向各地发出了关于油菜的快收、快打、快卖、快榨油的指示，要求各地作好油菜的细收细打、颗粒归家等工作。碧石渡公社灯塔管理区六十四个生产小队，有四十二个小队在抢收中腾出了抢雨用的房屋，其他各队也都准备了足够的枕垫和铺盖等防雨设备。为了作到颗粒归家，他们提出了“蔸蔸割净，刁刁上捆，捆捆打光，粒粒归仓”的口号。现在他们又提出了“勤打、勤扫、勤晒”的三勤措施，安排了二百四十多个半劳动力和妇女劳动力进行抢打。
    为了明年能有更高的产量，在收割前，各地普遍进行了选种留种。大部分生产队都是棵选的。东港管理区三十一个小队，有二十八个小队是棵选、单打、单晒、单储存。新庙管理区二生产队全部种子是集中在高额丰产试验田里进行除杂取精的。（附图片）
