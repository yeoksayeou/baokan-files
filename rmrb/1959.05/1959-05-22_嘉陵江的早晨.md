    Morning on the Jialing River
    Ji Xichen
    Early morning, the newly risen sun, shimmering with brilliant light, illuminates the clear and bright Jialing River. It is still early, but already, various sounds are rising from the riverside of Nanchong City: the whistle of the ferry; the horn of the oil trucks; the clamor of people crossing the river; and overwhelming all these sounds, the exuberant and sonorous chant of the Jialing River boatmen.
    Hai Zuo, Hai Zuo, Hai Zuo…
    The sun rises in the east, shining brightly,
    The sun illuminates the waters of the Jialing River!
    He Qi Zuo, He Qi Zuo, He Qi Zuo,
    Wei Lao Me, Hey Ya Hai Zuo…
    Hearing the boatmen's enthusiastic and bold work chorus, many people focus their attention on the sailing fleet. Hundreds of boatmen, in rhythm with the chant, raise their oars in unison, and strike them into the waves in unison, and then, the white sails, like arrows, rush toward the river surface reflecting the morning mist.
    "Listen, this chant, how beautiful!" Zhang Shaorong, a ticket collector on the Rocket ferry, standing in front of the railing, said to me with a hint of pride: "You know what? People who are used to running the river, when they hear that chant, it's like soldiers hearing military orders, who wouldn't feel their whole body heating up!"
    "Did you used to run boats too?"
    "How could I not! In the old days, I also moved oars and shouted chants on the long boats. I've lived for forty-three years, and thirty-five of them have been spent on the Jialing River! If I hadn't lost an eye and my leg wasn't bad. Hey hey, wouldn't I still be moving oars and shouting chants on the boat?"
    At this moment, on the dock, an old woman pulling a child, because of the crowd, couldn't get on the boat and was anxiously shouting. Hearing the shouts, Zhang Shaorong immediately ran over, picked up the child with one hand, and helped the old woman onto the boat with the other. He just settled the old woman down and then busied himself wiping the deck and greeting the guests. Only when the boat was about to depart did he excitedly come over to talk to me about the situation on the Jialing River and ask me:
    "Have you traveled the Jialing River?!"
    I said that I had traveled more than a thousand li along the river, from the source of the Jialing River—the ancient plank road Jialing Road on the southern slope of the Qinling Mountains—to the place where the Jialing River meets the Yangtze River. I personally saw how it changed from a murmuring stream to a torrential river; and the scenery along the river was so beautiful, with gorges, cliffs, pine forests, and historical sites… many poets and painters of ancient and modern times have come here. During the Tianbao years of the Tang Dynasty, the ancient painter Wu Daozi, on the orders of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, even came to this area specifically to paint the landscapes of the Jialing River!
    "The Jialing River is beautiful indeed," looking at the river flow, Zhang Shaorong said thoughtfully, "But, do you know how much blood, sweat, and tears of us poor people have flowed in this river?!"
    Leaning on the railing, he wiped his blind eye, lowered his head, and was silent for a long time before talking about his own blood-soaked experiences.
    "When my parents died, at the age of seven, I was pushing ferries for boat owners on the Jialing River. Because I was small, I couldn't push the boat and couldn't earn money, the boss didn't give me food, and at night, he would hang me up with ropes and beat me until my skin was torn and bruised. Later, I ran away; but, in that society where people eat people, where could I run to? There was no way, I had to rely on another boat owner and pull long boats hundreds of miles away…
    "That kind of life was really sinful! All year round, we were naked, our hands and feet crawling on the ground, our backs to the sky, moving oars and pulling towlines for the boss. In summer, the sun was like a fire roasting our heads, the sand was like a steamer under our feet, and our whole bodies were covered with swollen blisters. Winter was even more bitter, the wind was piercing, the water was icy, and when going into the water to arch the boats, our legs were frozen stiff, our feet were frostbitten, and in the sand, on the rocks, every step was a bloody footprint…."
    "How did you lose your eye?"
    Hearing my question, Zhang Shaorong looked up at the sky, and then, indignantly raised his hands, gnashing his teeth and accusing:
    "The eye? This one is blind, and this one can't see far either." As he spoke, he wiped away his tears: "One year, I was pulling a boat to Chongqing, and I got seriously ill on the boat, unconscious for several days. I wasn't even dead yet, but the ruthless boat owner sent someone to carry me away to bury me. They carried me to the Xiangguo Temple cemetery, and someone ran over and said: you can't bury him without registering with the water police. The people who were burying me just left me and ran away!
    "…In the grave pit, I spent two days and a night, and then I woke up. At first, I thought I was on the boat, and I kept shouting for water. Hearing the shout, a poor farmer named Zhou who was farming on the hillside ran over, only to see him with a pale face, asking me from afar: are you a human or a ghost?… I said, I want to drink water, and then he shouted loudly to the surrounding people: come and save someone… Later, this farmer brother carried me to his home, nursed me for half a year, and after I recovered from my illness, my eye was blind."
    At this time, the motorboat had crossed the smooth water surface and arrived at the center of the river. The river water was constantly rippling, making a gurgling sound, as if weeping for his misfortune. But, all of this has become the past forever.
    Just as I was about to comfort him, two wooden boats with red flags inserted, riding the wind and waves, came face to face from the river. The sturdy and strong boatmen, wearing blue clothes and pants, wrapped in white headscarves, neatly moved their oars while chanting in a tense and joyful manner:
    Standing up on the boat,
    Let's move the oars,
    The more we move, the more energetic we become,
    The boat flies forward.
    The song, full of infinite joy and strength, stirred everyone on the boat. Zhang Shaorong also suddenly became animated and waved his hand with everyone to greet the heroic boatmen brothers.
    The Jialing River boatmen, after successive social movements, after completely smashing the feudal foreman system, have already established trade unions and their own labor organizations. People who used to live in dilapidated shacks along the river have all moved into the dormitories of the water workers' union. And Zhang Shaorong himself, not only has three tile-roofed houses with wooden floors, his family of four is living a happy family life, and, under the Party's meticulous care, after more than two years of free treatment and recuperation, his severely damaged body has long since recovered. The organization specially took care of him, so he was assigned to the ferry to do light work. When he excitedly talked about all this, he said:
    "Without the Party, could there be Zhang Shaorong? Without socialism, where would there be the new life we have now?!" After a pause, he added: "Comrade! Now, not only have the boatmen turned over, but the Jialing River has also turned over. Listen, what is that sound coming from the lower river?!"
    From afar came the sound of rumbling explosions. This is nearly ten thousand riverside workers, on the 321-kilometer section of the Jialing River from Nanchong to Chongqing, launching an attack on the winding, rocky, and treacherous waterways. They ignite explosives, blasting away more than 200,000 cubic meters of dangerous shoals and reefs hidden above and below the water; they start up dredgers, using their own created steel rakes and steel grabs to dredge the narrow and shallow river channels into deep and wide waterways; they also build protective dams, navigation signal towers, and navigation marks in the turbulent river water. From now on, not only can wooden boats navigate freely, and the volume of transportation greatly increased, but also hundred-ton steamships and tugboats can also directly travel from Chongqing upstream to Nanchong. Nanchong's grain, silk, and Sichuan's oil will also roll down the river.
    Tens of thousands of boatmen fighting on the Jialing River, like Zhang Shaorong, personally witnessed the changes in the Jialing River. They have experienced their own yesterday, therefore, they cherish today a hundred times more, and thus, they will more bravely create tomorrow.

    嘉陵江的早晨
    纪希晨
    清晨，初出的太阳，闪烁着灿烂的光芒，照耀着清澈透亮的嘉陵江水。时候尚早，可是，南充市的江边上，却已响起了各种声浪：轮渡的汽笛声；运油汽车的喇叭声，过渡人的喧闹声；而压倒这一切声响的，是嘉陵江船工们奔放高昂的号子声。
    嗨佐、嗨佐、嗨佐……
    日出东方呵，放光明嗨，
    太阳照亮了呵，嘉陵江的水哟！
    呵起佐，呵起佐，呵起佐，
    喂老么呵，嘿呀嗨佐……
    听到船工们热情、粗犷的劳动大合唱，许多人都把目光集中到航行中的船队上。成百个船工，应着号子的音韵，整齐的举起了桡桨，又整齐的打在波浪上，于是，白色的风帆，便箭一般向映着朝雾的江面冲去了。
    “你听，这号子，多好听！”火箭号轮渡收票员张绍荣，站在栏杆前，带点儿骄傲对我说：“你知道吧？跑惯江的人，一听到那号子，就像士兵听了军令，那个不浑身热烘烘的呵！”
    “你也长跑船吗？”
    “怎不跑呀！在早，我也在长船上搬桡子，喊号子，我活了四十三岁，有三十五年都是在嘉陵江上过活的呀！如果我不瞎了一只眼、腿也不坏的话。嗨嗨，我还不是照样在船上搬桡子、喊号子吗？”
    这时，码头上，有一位拉着小孩的老大娘，因为人多，挤不上船，急的直喊。听见叫喊，张绍荣立刻跑过去，一手抱起孩子，一手把老大娘扶上船。刚刚把老大娘安顿好，就忙着擦甲板、招呼客人去了。直到船开的时候，他才兴致勃勃的走过来，同我摆起嘉陵江的情景，并问我说：
    “你走过嘉陵江吗？！”
    我说，我曾沿江跑过一千多里，从嘉陵江的发源地——秦岭南麓的古栈道嘉陵道起，直到嘉陵江和长江会合的地方。亲眼看见她怎样由潺潺的溪流，汇流成洪波滔滔的大江；而沿江的风光，又是那样的秀丽，峡谷、峭壁、松林、古迹……古今多少诗人、画家都来到过这里。唐代天宝年间，古代画家吴道子，奉唐明皇之命，还专门来这一带，画过嘉陵江的山水呢！
    “嘉陵江美倒美，”望着江流，张绍荣沉思的说：“可是，你知道，这江里，流过我们穷人多少血汗和眼泪呢？！”
    依靠着栏杆，他擦擦自己瞎了的眼睛，垂下头，沉默很久，才谈起自己充满血泪的经历。
    “父母一死，七岁上，我就在嘉陵江上，给船老板推渡船了。因为人小，推不动船，赚不到钱，老板不给吃饭，一到黑夜，还把我用绳子吊起，浑身打的皮开肉烂。后来，我跑了；可是，在那人吃人的社会里，能跑到哪去呢？莫办法，我只得又投靠另一家船老板，到几百里外拉起了长船……。
    “那种生活，可真造孽咧！终年光着身子，手脚爬地，脊背朝天，给老板搬桡、拉纤。夏天，头上太阳似火烤，脚下沙滩似蒸笼，浑身都烫起涨鼓鼓的水泡。冬天更苦，风刺骨，水冰寒，过滩下水去拱船，腿冻僵了，脚冻烂了，沙滩里，乱石上，一步一步都是流着血浓的脚印……。”
    “你眼睛是怎样瞎的呢？”
    听我一问，张绍荣仰面看着天空，然后，悲愤的举起双手，咬牙切齿的控诉说：
    “眼吗？这一只瞎了，这一只也看不远了。”他边说边揩着眼泪：“有一年，我拉船到重庆，在船上得了大病，几天不醒人事，人还没有断气，可是，狠心的船老板，便打发人来抬埋我了。抬到相国寺坟地，有个人跑来说：不经水上警察登记，不准埋。埋我的人，才丢下我跑了！
    “……在坟坑里，过了两天一夜，我醒了。开初，我还以为我是在船上哩，一个劲叫喊着要水喝。听见喊，坡上种地的一位姓周的贫农跑了来，只见他吓的满脸苍白，老远问我说：你是人，是鬼？……我说，我要喝水，他这才高声向周围呼喊：快来救人。……后来，这位农民兄弟把我抬到他家里，养了半年，病好了，眼也瞎了。”
    这时，机轮已穿过柔滑的水面，来到了江流的中心。江水不断漾起波纹，发出潺潺的声音，仿佛在为他的遭遇而悲泣。可是，这一切已永远成为过去了。
    当我正想安慰他的时候，恰好有两支插着红旗的木船，乘风破浪，迎面从江上飘来。结实健壮的船工们，穿着蓝色的衣裤，包着白色的头布，一边整齐地搬着桡子，一边紧张愉快地喊着号子：
    船上立起站罗，
    来把桡子搬罗，
    这越搬越有劲哟，
    那船就飞向前罗。
    充满无限欢乐和力量的歌声，激动着船上每一个人。张绍荣也顿时眉飞色舞，和大家一起举起手，向英雄的船工兄弟招手。
    嘉陵江船工，经过历次社会运动，在彻底粉碎封建把头制度之后，早已建立起工会和自己的劳动组织。昔日住在江边破棚茅舍里的人，全都搬入了水手工会的宿舍。而张绍荣自己，不但有了三间楼板瓦房，一家四口过着幸福的家庭生活，并且，在党无微不至的关怀下，经过两年多免费治疗休养，惨遭摧残的身体，也早已恢复了健康。组织上为特别照顾他，所以才分配到轮渡上，做轻巧的活路。当他激动的谈到这一切的时候，他说：
    “没有党，能有我张绍荣吗？没有社会主义，那有现在的新生活呵？！”停了停，他又补充说：“同志！如今，不光船工翻了身，就是嘉陵江也翻了身啦。你听，下江里是什么在响呀？！”
    远方传来隆隆的爆炸声，这是近万名沿河工人，在南充到重庆三百二十一公里的嘉陵江上，向曲折、多礁、多滩险的航道，展开了进攻。他们点燃炮药，炸除了密布在水上和水下的二十多万方险滩、暗礁；他们开动挖泥船，用自己创造的钢钯、钢抓，把又窄又浅的河槽，疏浚成深宽的航道；他们还在湍急的江水里，筑起护航的堤坝，导航的信号台和航标。从此，不仅木船可以自由通航，运输量大大增加，而且，百吨左右的火轮、拖船，也可以直接从重庆逆水开到南充。南充的粮食、丝绸、川中的石油，也将沿江滚滚而下。
    战斗在嘉陵江上的数万个船工，像张绍荣一样亲自目击了嘉陵江的变化。他们经历了自己的昨天，因之，便百倍地珍惜今天，从而，更加勇敢的去创造明天。
