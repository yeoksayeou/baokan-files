Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II held their third negotiation yesterday regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

It is revealed that both sides exchanged opinions on every clause of the treaty, and "reached an agreement in principle on some major issues." According to a broadcast by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation today, both sides agreed that "the applicable area of the treaty is the area under Japanese administrative jurisdiction, and Okinawa and Ogasawara will automatically be included in the treaty area after the administrative jurisdiction is returned to Japan." This means that the Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the interests of the Japanese nation, is colluding with the United States, on the one hand, to maintain the status quo of the United States occupying these two islands and turning them into U.S. atomic strategic bases in the Pacific; on the other hand, it has laid the groundwork for dragging Japan into the Northeast Asian aggressive bloc planned by the United States, because the military treaties signed by the United States with the Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Philippine cliques all include Okinawa and Ogasawara in the "joint defense" area. One of the main purposes of the United States agreeing to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is precisely to pull Japan into the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization." Kishi Nobusuke has already stated that Japan may "engage in joint operations with the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek cliques" in Okinawa.

The Japan Broadcasting Corporation also said that both sides agreed that "measures in case of emergency and the deployment, equipment, and dispatch of U.S. troops to places outside Japan will be treated as bilateral matters between the U.S. and Japan, and the issue of the dispatch of U.S. troops to foreign countries will be consulted in advance in the form of an exchange of official documents." The Japanese public has long pointed out that this is a cunning trick by the United States to turn Japan into a nuclear weapons base and nuclear-arm Japan under the guise of "prior consultation" with Japan, and to make Japan sponsor its aggressive activities in Asia.

Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke has repeatedly claimed in the Diet that the U.S. military transporting nuclear weapons into Japan "does not violate the Constitution," and that the Japanese army can also possess nuclear weapons, etc., which fully confirms the above-mentioned U.S. conspiracy.

Both sides agreed to set the term of this new treaty, which seriously infringes upon Japanese sovereignty and will drag Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, to "roughly ten years."

Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama's remarks to reporters after the meeting showed that the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to reach a complete agreement on the revision of the "Security Treaty" before the Upper House election on June 2. He said that in the next negotiation scheduled for the 8th, he and Douglas MacArthur II will summarize the results of previous negotiations and discuss the issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement." He said that the Japanese government intends to publish an outline of the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" before the Upper House election.

    把日本推入美国原子战略体系
    岸政府同美国加紧军事勾结
    日美就修改“安全条约”主要问题达成原则协议
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎同美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二昨天举行了关于修改日美“安全条约”的第三次谈判。
    据透露，双方就条约的每一项条款交换了意见，并且“在原则上就一些主要问题达成了协议”。据日本广播协会今天广播，双方同意“条约的适用地区为日本的行政管辖权所及的地区，冲绳和小笠原在行政管辖权交还日本以后将自动地纳入条约地区”。这就是说，岸信介政府不顾日本民族利益和美国互相勾结，一方面保持美国占领这两个岛屿和把这两个岛屿变成美国在太平洋的原子战略基地的现状；另一方面又为把日本拉入美国策划的东北亚侵略集团埋下了伏笔，因为美国同李承晚、蒋介石集团和菲律宾签订的军事条约都把冲绳和小笠原划入了“共同防御”地区。美国同意修改日美“安全条约”的主要目的之一正是要把日本拉进“东北亚条约组织”。岸信介已经表示，日本可能会在冲绳岛同李承晚、蒋介石集团“发生共同作战的情况”。
    日本广播协会还说，双方同意
  “发生紧急情况时的措施以及美军的部署、装备和美军出动到日本以外的地方等将做为日美两国的双边事项，其中美军出动到外地的问题将用交换公文的形式事先进行协商”。日本公众早已指出，这是美国在同日本“事先协商”的美名下，为把日本变成核武器基地和核武装日本以及使日本赞助它在亚洲的侵略活动的狡猾手段。
    日本首相岸信介在国会里一再声称美军把核武器运进日本“并不违反宪法”，日本军队也可以保有核武器等等，完全证实了美国的上述阴谋。
    双方同意把这一严重侵犯日本主权并会把日本拉入美国原子战略体系的新条约的期限“大致定为十年”。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎在会谈后向新闻记者发表的谈话表明，岸信介政府正企图在6月2日举行的参议员选举前就修改“安全条约”问题达成完全的协议。他说，在预定8日举行的下次谈判中，他和麦克阿瑟第二将总结以往谈判的结果和讨论修改日美“行政协定”问题。他说，日本政府打算在参议员选举前发表修改日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”的纲要。
