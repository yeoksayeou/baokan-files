(Our Dispatch from Guangzhou, May 30) The Standing Committee (Enlarged) Meeting of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, in reviewing this year's early-season production and discussing the organization of late-season production, believes that this year's grain production situation will be one of continued great leap forward. The meeting called on the entire party and all the people to summon up their energy, continue to firmly grasp early-season crops, and grasp them to the end; at the same time, start early to prepare for a decisive victory in late-season production.

The meeting was held in Shantou from May 5th to 15th. In addition to the members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, the participants included the First Secretary of the Hainan District Party Committee, the First Secretaries of various prefectural committees, the Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, and the heads of relevant departments, committees, offices, and bureaus of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee.

The meeting's assessment of this year's 28 million mu of early rice is as follows: the conditions of water conservancy and fertilizer are better than last year, the deep plowing is mostly reasonable, providing good conditions for the growth of seedlings; the transplanting season meets the requirements, especially the specifications are more reasonable, the density of early rice this year has increased by nearly double compared to last year, and the shortcomings of excessive density in some late rice plantings last year have been avoided. For the past six months, the weather has been favorable, and there have been fewer pests and diseases. Most of the early rice is now pregnant with ears and not far from harvest, and a bumper harvest is highly promising.

The meeting, in reviewing past work, believes that there were shortcomings in the guidance of this year's early-season production. The main reason is that the Provincial Party Committee overestimated the possibility of planting less, producing more, and harvesting more this year, resulting in a reduction in the area planted with spring harvest grain crops, and the area planted with early rice this year was also reduced compared to last year. Some indica rice seeds introduced from other places were not tested; and more early rice was directly sown. Most of these indica rice fields and directly sown fields have relatively poor growth. However, despite these shortcomings, since the various conditions for early rice are better than last year, especially due to the implementation of rational close planting, if there are no major natural disasters and if the lodging stage is successfully passed, then the yield per unit area of early rice will definitely increase compared to last year, and the total output will also be higher than last year. The broad masses of cadres and peasants, seeing the vast majority of well-grown seedlings, are encouraged by the prospect of a bumper harvest; they also see the benefits of the commune's implementation of unified leadership, hierarchical management, and hierarchical accounting, and the commune's distribution methods have become more reasonable after rectification; the leading cadres of the party at all levels have made significant progress in adhering to the style of seeking truth from facts and following the mass line, thus improving communication between superiors and subordinates and bringing cadre-masses relations closer. These conditions combined have created a favorable situation in current rural work, and the production confidence and enthusiasm of cadres and peasants have been further stimulated. While continuing to vigorously grasp the late-stage field management of early rice and strive for a greater bumper harvest, they are stepping up preparations for late-season production. On the basis of a great early-season harvest, they will turn around and fight another beautiful decisive victory in the late-season harvest with greater energy and higher confidence. This is an inevitable trend. In terms of production guidance, this year's late-season crops will definitely be able to avoid the shortcomings that have occurred in the past. Thus, for the entire province, as long as we continue to summon up our energy and rely closely on the masses, the total grain output for the year will greatly surpass last year, thereby continuing to achieve a great leap forward victory. Therefore, the meeting believes that we must conscientiously learn from the shortcomings in past work and realistically overcome the difficulties in current work; however, these shortcomings and difficulties are definitely secondary compared to the achievements and the already formed favorable situation.

The meeting reiterated the correct slogan of "ten points of targets, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of effort." The meeting believes that grain production targets must be implemented, and we must do everything possible to increase production as much as possible. It is wrong to only consider needs without considering possibilities, and to only emphasize the subjective role of people without acknowledging the primacy of objective conditions. However, conversely, it is also wrong to underestimate the subjective dynamic role of people, to only see difficulties without seeing that difficulties can be overcome through effort, and to not recognize that objective conditions can be changed through effort. Therefore, when considering this year's grain production tasks, we must have ten points of targets, and we must fully estimate the role of people. Ten points of targets can mobilize people to think of ways and tap potential. Therefore, the meeting decided that early rice should continue to strengthen late-stage field management to strive for dozens of catties more grain per mu. The decisive victory lies in late-season crops. We must start early, prepare fully, and strive for victory in the decisive battle of late rice. The main slogan for organizing the late-season production movement is to launch a thousand-catty rice, ten-thousand-catty sweet potato movement. Last year, there were many rice paddies with a yield of one thousand catties per mu, and the experience of thousand-catty high yields has been mastered by the masses. Sweet potatoes with a yield of ten thousand catties per mu have also appeared in many places. During this meeting, the comrades participating in the meeting personally harvested two generally cultivated sweet potato fields in Chaoyang County. One yielded 9,900 catties per mu, and the other yielded 10,200 catties per mu. Therefore, it should be entirely possible for each county and commune in the province to designate a certain percentage of their fields to strive for one thousand catties of rice and ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes, based on their own circumstances. This year's late-season crops are to combine large-area high yields with extensive planting and multiple harvests by launching a thousand-catty rice, ten-thousand-catty sweet potato movement. On the one hand, we will maintain last year's planting area, and on the other hand, we will increase the yield per unit area in order to strive for a great leap forward in grain production. In addition, while carrying out the large-area high-yield movement, we must vigorously grasp backward fields, eliminate backward fields, and strive to gradually achieve balanced development.

The meeting believes that doing everything possible to further boost the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is the key to doing all work well. To this end, in the next month and a half, we must earnestly convene meetings of commune members' representatives. In order not to delay production, the meetings of commune members' representatives can be held intermittently, resolving one issue thoroughly each time. The representative meetings should be convened at the commune level. Before the commune members' representative meeting is convened, the secretaries' meetings of the Party committees at the commune and production brigade levels should be held at the county level to make the cadres at these two levels truly understand the importance of using democratic methods to hold the meetings of commune members' representatives well. When the commune representative meeting is convened, everyone must be allowed to express their opinions freely, and then everyone should be guided to present the facts, reason, distinguish between right and wrong, affirm achievements, admit shortcomings, and see both the difficulties and the favorable conditions. These efforts should be used to enable cadres and the masses to communicate, comprehensively summarize the experiences and lessons of the Great Leap Forward together, unify understanding, carry forward successful experiences, overcome the shortcomings, develop initiative, and eliminate blindness. Furthermore, the production targets and measures for this year should be submitted to the masses for joint discussion and decision. In this way, a situation of cheerful mood and soaring enthusiasm will surely emerge. On the one hand, we must grasp ideology, and on the other hand, we must grasp policy. At the representative meeting, we must ensure that the principle of unified leadership, hierarchical management, and hierarchical accounting is thoroughly implemented; the production targets must be both advanced and realistic, ensuring that the production units have output to exceed and rewards to obtain. The meeting emphasized that we must better care for the material life of commune members in the future. We must care for both the long-term interests of commune members and the immediate interests of commune members.

Considering the arduous tasks of this year's agricultural production and rural work, the meeting, based on the central government's instructions and combined with the province's situation, decided that the first secretaries of county party committees should devote all their efforts to agricultural production and rural work this year, the first secretaries of prefectural party committees should devote more than two-thirds of their time, and the first secretary of the provincial party committee should devote more than half of his time to agricultural production and rural work.

In order to actively support the great leap forward in agriculture, the meeting also stipulated a series of specific measures in industry, transportation, and other aspects.

    管好早稻　抓紧晚造
    广东省委决定立即展开千斤稻万斤薯运动
    今年的有利条件是：禾苗长得好公社办得好干群关系好
    本报广州30日电　中共广东省委会常委（扩大）会议在检查今年早造生产和讨论组织晚造生产的时候，认为今年的粮食生产形势，将是一个继续大跃进的形势。会议号召全党全民鼓足干劲，继续狠狠地抓早造，把早造抓到底；与此同时，及早动手，准备晚造决胜。
    会议于5月5日至15日在汕头举行。参加会议的，除省委常委委员以外，还有海南区党委、各地委第一书记、广州市委书记，以及省委、省人民委员会的有关部、委、厅、局的负责人。
    会议对今年二千八百多万亩早稻的估计是：水利、肥料的条件比较去年好，深翻大部分是合理的，对禾苗生长提供了良好的条件；插秧季节合于要求，特别是规格比较合理，比去年早稻的密度增加将近一倍，又避免了去年少数晚稻种植过密的缺点。半年来，风调雨顺，病虫害较少。现在绝大部分早稻已经孕穗，离收获期不远，丰收大有希望。
    会议在检查过去工作时，认为在今年早造生产的指导上是有缺点的。主要是省委对今年实行少种、高产、多收的可能性估计得过高了，以致今年春收粮食作物由于缩小种植面积而减少了，今年早稻也比去年少种了一些。有些从外地引进的粳稻种子，没有经过试验；早稻直播田也种得多了一点。这些粳稻田和直播田，大部分生势比较差一些。但是，尽管有这些缺点，由于早稻各种条件都比去年好，特别是由于实行了合理密植，如果没有特大自然灾害，并且胜利地通过倒伏一关，那末，早稻单位面积产量将肯定比去年增产，而且总产量也将比去年为高。广大干部和农民群众，看到大多数长得很好的禾苗，受到丰收景象的鼓舞；又看到公社实行统一领导、分级管理和分级核算的好处，公社的分配方式经过整顿后也较前更为合理；各级党的领导干部，在坚持实事求是、走群众路线的作风方面有了显著的进步，因而上下通气、干群关系更加密切。这些条件合在一起，便造成了当前农村工作的有利形势，干部和农民群众的生产信心和干劲进一步激发起来，正在继续狠抓早稻后期田间管理，力争更大丰收的同时，加紧准备晚造生产。他们将在早稻大丰收的基础上，以更大的劲头和更高的信心，转而再打一个漂亮的晚造大丰收的胜仗。这是必然的趋势。在生产指导上，今年晚造将肯定能够避免过去出现过的那些缺点。这样，就全省来说，只要我们继续鼓足干劲，密切依靠群众，全年粮食总产量就会大大超过去年，从而继续取得大跃进的胜利。因此，会议认为，我们必须认真地从过去工作中的缺点吸取教训，实事求是地克服当前工作中的困难；但是，这些缺点和困难，比起成绩，比起已经形成的有利形势来说，肯定是次要的。
    会议再度强调提出了“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”这个正确的口号。会议认为，粮食生产指标既要落实，又要千方百计尽可能地增产。只考虑到需要而不考虑可能，只强调人的主观作用而不承认客观条件的第一性，那是错误的。但是，如果反过来，轻视人的主观能动作用，只看到困难而看不到困难经过努力可以克服，不承认客观条件可以经过努力而加以改变，那也是错误的。所以，考虑今年的粮食生产任务时，一定要有十分指标，要将人的作用充分地估计进去。十分指标，可以动员人们想办法、挖潜力。因此，会议决定目前早稻仍应继续加强后期田间管理，争取每亩多打几十斤粮。决胜在晚造。必须及早动手，充分准备，争取晚稻决战的胜利。组织晚造生产运动的主要口号是开展千斤稻万斤薯运动。去年一造亩产千斤的稻田很多，千斤丰产经验已经被群众所掌握了。亩产万斤的番薯也出现不少。这次会议期间，参加会议的同志就到潮阳县亲手收割了两块一般栽培的薯田。其中一块亩产九千九百斤，一块亩产一万零二百斤。所以，全省各县、各公社根据自己的情况，划定百分之几十的田，争取水稻千斤、番薯万斤，应当说是完全办得到的。今年晚造，就是要以开展千斤稻、万斤薯运动，以大面积丰产来同广种多收相结合，一方面保持去年的种植面积，另方面提高单位面积产量，以便争取粮食生产的大跃进。此外，在开展大面积丰产运动的同时，要狠狠抓落后田，消灭落后田，争取逐步达到平衡发展。
    会议认为，想尽一切办法，进一步鼓足干部和群众的干劲，是做好一切工作的关键。为此要在今后一个半月的时间内，切实开好社员代表大会。为了不耽误生产，社员代表大会可用停停开开，每开一段彻底解决一个问题的办法。代表大会应以公社为单位召开。公社社员代表大会召开之前，要先以县为单位开好公社与生产大队两级的党委书记会议，使这两级干部真正懂得为什么强调用发扬民主来开好社员代表大会的重要性。公社代表大会召开的时候，必须做到人人畅述己见，然后引导大家摆事实、讲道理，分清是非，肯定成绩，承认缺点，既看到困难又看到有利条件。要求通过这些工作，使干部和群众通了气，共同把大跃进的经验教训全面总结起来，统一认识，发扬成功经验，克服其中的缺点，发扬积极性，去掉盲目性。进而把今年的生产指标和措施交群众共同商量和决定。这样一来，就一定会呈现一个心情舒畅、干劲冲天的局面。一方面要抓思想，另方面要抓政策。在代表会上，必须保证把统一领导、分级管理、分级核算的原则贯彻到底；包产指标既要先进又必须落实，保证包产单位有产可超，有奖可得。会议强调今后要更好地关心社员的物质生活。既要关心社员的长远利益，又要关心社员的眼前利益。
    考虑到今年农业生产和农村工作的繁重任务，会议根据中央指示结合本省情况，决定县委第一书记今年内全力抓农业生产和农村工作，地委第一书记以三分之二以上的时间，省委第一书记以一半以上时间抓农业生产和农村工作。
    为了积极支援农业的大跃进，会议还在工业、运输等方面规定了一系列具体的措施。
