Xinhua News Agency, 28th. With the arrival of the hot summer, a summer patriotic health campaign centered on disease prevention and heatstroke prevention is rapidly unfolding across the country.

    At present, many cities, industrial and mining enterprises, and rural people's communes are taking vigorous measures, closely focusing on the central link of preventing summer infectious diseases—food hygiene—and improving it in all aspects. Many units have added summer hygiene equipment and stipulated various food hygiene systems. In Beijing, public canteens and restaurants have widely implemented washing utensils with clean water, rinsing with warm water, and disinfecting by boiling or steaming. The Beijing Shengli Sauce Factory has added fly and dust prevention equipment for two thousand sauce jars. The Anfu Hutong Meat Processing Factory in Xicheng District has established a system for inspecting and selling raw materials and finished products, and will not process or sell rotten and deteriorated food. Recently, the city inspected the hygiene of more than 980 food service businesses, and most of them have reached the standards stipulated in the hygiene competition. In Shanghai, some administrative districts' food and beverage companies, in conjunction with relevant units, have contracted out the hygiene supervision of shops and stalls, strengthened the acceptance of food, and prevented spoilage. In rural public canteens, special attention is paid to protecting the cleanliness of water sources. The Baiyangtian People's Commune in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, has adopted measures such as using river water in sections, separating water ponds for use and drinking, and cleaning and covering wells to prevent water pollution. The public canteens of communes in various places generally carry out fly and rodent prevention work, pay attention to the hygiene of cooking utensils and tableware, do not eat spoiled food, do not eat meat from sick or dead livestock, and do not drink raw water.

    This year's summer heat arrived early, and a large number of new workers have been added to the industrial front. In order to protect the health of workers, many factories and mines with high-temperature operations are actively carrying out cooling and heatstroke prevention work. The Daye Steel Plant has taken measures to improve workshop ventilation, heat insulation, and supply of cool drinks and health foods. Many newly built iron and steel enterprises pay special attention to cooling work. The newly built Shandong Machine Factory Steel Branch, according to the construction steps, on the one hand, quickly took cooling measures and added equipment to the blast furnace put into production, and on the other hand, combined with the basic construction work to immediately solve the cooling equipment in steelmaking and rolling production. More than 30 factories with high-temperature operations in Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, Yangquan and other cities in Shanxi Province, in addition to overhauling all the original cooling equipment, also self-made and purchased more than 550 sets of equipment such as air showers, insulated water tanks, spray fans, and cold air cooling machines. Factory and mine leaders in various places attach great importance to and care about the health of workers in high-temperature operations. They work with health personnel to strengthen cooling measures and check the cooling effect. The Chongqing Municipal Health Department has conducted health checks on more than 6,000 workers in high-temperature operations and adjusted workers who are not suitable for high-temperature operations.

    In the vast rural areas, in order to adapt to production in the hot summer climate, people's communes in various places have begun to pay attention to rationally allocating labor time and labor force, implementing midday breaks, and strengthening women's labor protection. Gaotang County, Shandong Province, requires all communes to set up water supply stations, build rest sheds, and members wear straw hats when going to the fields, and pay attention to drinking cold boiled water frequently. In order to support the rural summer harvest and summer planting, many medical personnel in various places have carried medicines and equipment, and go deep into the fields, construction sites, canteens, and workers' residential areas to carry out the prevention and treatment of summer infectious diseases and health propaganda.

    灭蝇降温　防病防暑
    全国各地迅速开展夏季卫生运动
    新华社28日讯　随着炎夏的到来，一个以防病、防暑为中心的夏季爱国卫生运动正在各地迅速展开。
    目前，许多城市、工矿企业和农村人民公社正在采取有力措施，紧紧抓住预防夏季传染病的中心环节——饮食卫生，从各方面加以改进。许多单位已经添制夏季卫生设备，规定了各项饮食卫生制度。北京市各家公共食堂、饭铺洗刷食具已经广泛实行清水洗、温水过、煮沸或蒸汽消毒。北京市胜利制酱厂添制了二千口酱缸用的防蝇防尘设备，西城区安福胡同肉品加工厂建立了原料成品的验收验售制度，不加工和出售腐烂变质食品。最近，全市检查了九百八十多家饮食行业的卫生，大部分都达到了卫生竞赛中所规定的标准。上海市有些行政区饮食品公司会同有关单位分头包干店、摊的卫生督促工作，对食品加强验收，防止腐坏。在农村中的公共食堂，特别注意保护水源清洁，湖南临湘县白羊田人民公社采取河水分段使用，水塘用水与饮水分塘使用，对水井加以掏洗、加盖等办法，防止饮水污染。各地公社的公共食堂普遍进行防蝇、防鼠工作，注意了炊具、食具卫生、不吃腐败食物，不吃病死牲畜肉、不喝生水等。
    今年暑期来的早，工业战线上又增添了大批新工人。为了保障工人的健康，许多有高温作业的厂矿，正在积极进行降温、防暑工作，大冶钢厂已采取措施改进车间通风、隔热和供给清凉饮料保健食品等。许多新建的钢铁企业，对降温工作特别关注。新建的山东机器厂钢铁分厂根据基建步骤，一面对投入生产的炼铁炉迅速采取降温措施、添置设备，一面又结合基本建设工作立即解决炼钢、轧钢生产中的降温设备。山西省太原、大同、长治、阳泉等市三十余个有高温作业的工厂，除对原有降温设备全部加以检修外，并自制和购买空气淋浴、隔热水箱、喷雾风扇、冷风降温机等设备五百五十余套。各地厂矿领导十分重视和关怀高温作业工人的健康。他们协同卫生人员一面加强降温措施，一面进行检查降温效果。重庆市卫生部门已对六千多高温作业工人作了健康检查，对不适宜高温作业的工人作了调整。
    在广大农村中，为适应夏季炎热气候下进行生产，各地人民公社已开始注意合理支配劳动时间和调配劳动力，实行午间休息，加强妇女劳动保护。山东省高唐县要求各公社普遍设立供水站、搭休息凉棚，社员下地戴草帽，注意勤喝凉开水。为支援农村夏收夏种，各地许多医务人员已携带药械，深入田间、工地、食堂、工人住宅区，进行夏季传染病的防治和卫生宣传工作。（附图片）
