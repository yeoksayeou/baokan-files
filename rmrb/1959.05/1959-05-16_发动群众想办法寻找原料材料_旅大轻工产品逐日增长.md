Mobilize the Masses to Find Raw Materials
Dalian-Lushun Light Industrial Products Increase Daily

(Our report) Light industry workers in Dalian-Lushun have achieved great success in the "high quality, high yield, more varieties" campaign. Workers overcame difficulties such as material and power shortages, leading to a new production situation with daily output increases. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, cotton yarn production increased by 87%, cotton cloth by 103%, paper by 124%, and alcohol by 11% in the first quarter. The total output value of the first quarter increased by 37.2% compared to the same period last year, and by 17.6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Product quality has also significantly improved. During this period, the city added 811 new products such as insulating paper, as well as over 120 small commodities such as small wooden items and thin rubber bands.

The greater leap forward in light industry is the result of workers engaging in technical revolution and technical innovation, working hard and cleverly. Workers cleverly tapped the potential of equipment, leading to continuous production increases. Workers at the Dalian-Lushun Knitting Factory changed the single-sided knitting machine from sixteen yarn feeds to thirty-two yarn feeds, resulting in a doubled output while ensuring quality. Workers at the Dalian Leather Factory created a welting machine to replace manual operation, increasing production efficiency by four to five times. Workers widely carried out savings, substitutions, and self-production of raw materials, solving the problem of material shortages through self-reliance. Workers at the Dalian-Lushun Stationery Factory utilized previously discarded oblique silk wood and knot heads, yielding an additional 15,000 pencils per cubic meter of wood. The supply of tinplate and bamboo shells for the production of thermos shells at the Dalian-Lushun Glass Products Factory was intermittent. Workers researched and developed the use of tempered glass shells as a substitute, making them less prone to breakage and more aesthetically pleasing. Workers learned from foreign experiences to improve the vacuum of thermos bottle liners, extending the insulation time from the previous twenty-four hours to thirty hours.

The "high quality, high yield, more varieties" mass movement in the Dalian-Lushun light industry sector was launched at the beginning of this year based on a unified understanding among light industry workers. In accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, the Dalian-Lushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China determined at the beginning of the year that the city's light industrial products should achieve a new leap forward this year to meet the growing needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. It launched a pragmatic discussion among cadres in the light industry sector, criticized the negative thinking that emphasized difficulties and the one-sided view of pursuing output value without considering market needs, and thus formulated a production plan. Under the leadership of the Municipal Committee, the Municipal Light Industry Bureau immediately mobilized more than 50,000 light industry workers in state-owned factories, handicraft production cooperatives, and street-run civil industries throughout the city, launching a mass movement aimed at "high quality, high yield, more varieties." This movement is currently continuing. (Attached picture)

### 发动群众想办法寻找原料材料  旅大轻工产品逐日增长

    发动群众想办法寻找原料材料
    旅大轻工产品逐日增长
    本报讯　旅大市轻工业职工在“高质、高产、多品种”运动中取得了很大成就。职工们战胜了材料、电力不足等困难，使生产出现了新的局面，产量逐日上升。第一季度与去年第四季度比，棉纱产量增长了87％，棉布增长了103％，纸张增长了124％，酒精增长了11％。第一季度生产总值比去年同期增长37.2％，比去年第四季度增长17.6％，产品质量也有显著提高。在这个期间，全市共增加了绝缘纸等八百一十一种新产品，以及小木器、细胶绳等一百二十多种小百货。
    轻工业的更大跃进，是职工大闹技术革命技术革新，苦干巧干得来的。职工们巧挖设备潜力，使生产不断上升。旅大针织厂职工把单面织机的十六路进纱改为三十二路进纱，结果在保证质量的前提下，产量跃增一倍。大连皮革厂工人创造窝边机代替手工操作，使生产效率提高四到五倍。职工们广泛开展节约、代用和自己生产原料材料，自力更生解决原料不足的问题。旅大文教用品厂职工把过去扔掉的斜丝木和疤结头都利用上，每立方公尺木材可多出铅笔一万五千支。旅大玻璃制品厂生产暖水瓶壳的马口铁和竹壳供应时断时续，职工们研究出用玻璃壳经过钢化代用，使用起来不易碰碎，装璜更加美观。职工学习外地经验提高了暖水瓶胆的真空度，还使保温时间由过去的二十四小时延长到三十小时。
    旅大市轻工业部门的“高质、高产、多品种”群众运动，是今年年初轻工业职工在统一认识的基础上开展起来的。中共旅大市委根据中央和省委的指示精神，年初就确定今年全市轻工业产品要有新的跃进，以满足工农业生产和人民生活日益增长的需要。在轻工业部门干部中发动务虚、讨论，批判了强调困难的消极思想和片面追求产值不从市场需要出发等片面观点，从而订出了生产计划，在市委的领导下，市轻工局立即发动全市国营工厂、手工业生产合作社和街道民办工业的五万余名轻工业职工，掀起一个以“高质、高产、多品种”为目标的群众运动。目前这个运动正在继续进行。（附图片）
