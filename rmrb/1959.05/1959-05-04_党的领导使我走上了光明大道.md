Comrade Gu Gengyu's Speech

This time, I attended the National People's Congress meeting as a non-voting delegate, listened to the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and also listened to the report of Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at the CPPCC meeting. First of all, I express my complete support for these reports.

I am a bourgeois element currently undergoing transformation, having just graduated from the Socialist Academy. The year and a half of study there has brought me great gains. Today, I would like to report to everyone on the transformation of my thinking before and after this study.

I was born into a bourgeois family, educated in bourgeois missionary schools, and directly engaged in exploitation for more than thirty years. I am a person with deeply rooted bourgeois ideas. On the eve of the national liberation, I came into contact with comrades engaged in commercial work of the Party in order to get rich, and later became acquainted with some leading comrades of the Party. Under the ideological influence of these leading comrades, I approached the revolutionary camp.

After the national liberation, the Party Committee appointed me as a member of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, truly treating me as a national talent. However, my bourgeois ideology was still quite strong, and I was reluctant to part with capitalism. I only thought about going abroad to enjoy myself and live a bourgeois life, and was unwilling to take a position in the country. In 1950, when Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping wanted to arrange work for me in Chongqing, I refused to accept the work on the pretext that Vice Minister Yao Yilin of the Ministry of Foreign Trade had asked me to go to the United States for a mission. When Vice Minister Yao wanted to assign me to work in the country, I again refused on the grounds that I did not understand socialist management, and wished to work abroad in the guise of my original Hong Kong company. In short, I was reluctant to give up my original high salary of more than three thousand yuan and the garden house, and could not get used to the "simple" life in the country. Everything started from personal interests, not serving the people wholeheartedly, but half-heartedly following the socialist road.

In 1955, I returned to Beijing to apply for joint public-private ownership. At that time, I also had two intentions: on the one hand, after several years of contact with the Party, I had some understanding of the Party's policies, and from the perspective of my own future, I wanted to actively get closer to the Party; on the other hand, the enterprise I was running in Hong Kong was facing a crisis of bankruptcy, and I hoped that the state could take out money to pay off my debts and save me from bankruptcy after the joint venture. My wishes were fully realized with the help of the Party. This shows that the Party's care for me is truly perfect.

However, because my bourgeois ideology was still quite strong, I was arrogant and mistakenly believed that I did not need to undergo a thorough transformation. I believed that in the socialist era, capitalists only needed to follow the Communist Party and cooperate with the Communist Party. Bourgeois elements have mastered modern culture and technology, which the working class also needs, and thus the idea of beautifying the bourgeoisie was born. Therefore, in 1954, I agreed with the "red bourgeoisie" concept proposed by the rightist Zhang Naiqi. I felt uncomfortable when others talked about the ugly side of the bourgeoisie, always thinking it was an exaggeration, which led to dissatisfaction with the working class, thinking that the workers in my own enterprise had nothing to learn from. When the first phase of the Socialist Academy was enrolling students, I did not sign up myself and was unwilling to participate, thinking in my mind that the Party members would take care of politics, and I would take care of business, treating politics and business separately.

The Party's great rectification movement and the struggle against the rightists gave me a great education. In the face of ironclad facts, I recognized the ugly face of the bourgeoisie and the duality of the bourgeoisie, which sounded an alarm for me. Only then did I understand that if the bourgeoisie does not undergo a thorough transformation, it is impossible to serve the people wholeheartedly, but only to serve fame and fortune. I began to feel that my political stance and thinking had reached a situation that was not suitable for my position, and therefore strived to participate in the study at the Socialist Academy. After a year of study, I have made great progress politically and ideologically. The Socialist Academy is a crucible for the transformation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, and an excellent place for the transformation of bourgeois elements. The establishment of such an academy precisely demonstrates the Party's care for bourgeois elements. I thank the Party for enabling me to gain a lot in this academy. My gains can be roughly summarized as follows:

(1) I have initially overcome the wavering thought of taking the socialist road. As mentioned above, although I have followed the Party for ten years since the founding of the new China, I have come over in a half-hearted and wavering way. Even in the middle of studying at the Socialist Academy, I still showed some wavering, such as being somewhat worried about the situation in the Taiwan Strait and overestimating the enemy's strength. I also registered to participate in the people's commune because I was a senior cadre of the state and it would not be good if I did not participate, but in reality, I had many concerns and was unwilling to participate. After learning and debating, I have gained some understanding of these bourgeois ideas. First of all, I have a preliminary understanding of the laws of social development and understand the truth that it is necessary to take the socialist road, and I have recognized the beautiful prospects of communism. In comparing the strength of the enemy and ourselves, after studying Chairman Mao's document on "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" and listening to the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen, I recognized the essentially strong exterior but hollow interior of imperialism, destined for its demise, which helped me strengthen my determination to take the socialist road.

(2) I have improved my political sense of smell and have a preliminary understanding of major issues of right and wrong. In the past, because my bourgeois stand and thinking had not changed, I could not clearly distinguish between major issues of right and wrong, or even was unable to distinguish them, which was very dangerous. After a year of study, my political sense of smell has improved, and I have some understanding of major issues of right and wrong. In the study group discussion, I can also criticize incorrect speeches, and I can generally distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds and distinguish between right and wrong boundaries.

(3) I have initially mastered the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Before studying, I had no idea how to use this weapon of the proletariat. When comrades made criticisms of me, although I accepted them on the surface, I felt extremely sad in my heart. When I made self-criticism, I was also afraid to expose myself, not deeply or thoroughly. I was also not used to criticizing others. After a year of study and exercise, especially the debates and criticisms at the group meetings, I am now able to initially master this weapon. I dare to expose some of my shortcomings, and I am not as sad as I used to be when accepting criticisms from others, and I am also more humble. I also dare to offer some opinions to other comrades. Although it is still far from the proletarian standard, I have been able to initially master it, which is a great advantage for my continued transformation.

(4) I have initially experienced the life of the working people and have some labor views. In the past, I was a person who had never participated in physical labor, and I had no experience of the labor of workers and peasants at all, or even despised it. This time in the study, we participated in the production labor of the Sijiqing People's Commune. From actual experience, I truly realized that labor is not easy, it is great and glorious, and it is shameful to gain without labor. At the same time, I truly understood the truth that labor creates the world. I was especially moved by the fact that once I worked with a female commune member, and her labor efficiency was ten times stronger than mine, which made me feel very ashamed. After this period of labor, my feelings for the working people have changed a lot, which will help me continue to transform myself into a self-reliant worker.

In short, more than a year of study has given me great gains, which has given me the determination to take the socialist road and carry out a thorough self-transformation. I have taken a big step towards the Party, and I realize that I must listen to the Party and obey the Party's leadership. Although my gains are great, I am still far from being transformed into a self-reliant worker.

However, the Party has led me onto a bright road. As long as I continue to work hard and move forward, I believe that I will definitely be transformed into a self-reliant worker.

Now that I have returned to my work post, I must work hard, study actively, and continue to transform myself under the leadership of the Party. According to the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, I will constantly measure myself, criticize myself, and especially strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and Chairman Mao's writings, combine my own ideological reality and work practice, and carry out self-transformation through criticism and self-criticism. The above are some of my experiences through a year of study. I hope that all the members will correct me and wish all the members good health.

### 党的领导使我走上了光明大道

    党的领导使我走上了光明大道
    古耕虞委员的发言
    这一次我列席全国人民代表大会会议，听取了周总理，李富春、李先念两位副总理，彭真副委员长的报告，并在全国政治协商委员会会议上听取了全国政协副主席李维汉的报告。我首先表示对这几个报告完全拥护。
    我是一个正在改造中的资产阶级分子，刚刚在社会主义学院学习结业，在这一年多学习中，使我得到很大收获，今天我想把我学习前后的思想改造情况，向大家汇报一下。
    我出身于资产阶级的家庭，在资产阶级的教会学校读书，并直接参加剥削三十余年，是一个资产阶级思想根深蒂固的人。全国解放的前夕，为了发财致富与党的商业工作同志发生接触，以后并认识 了一些党的领导同志，在这些领导同志的思想影响下，我才靠近了革命阵营。
    全国解放后，党委任我为西南军政委员会的委员，真是以国士待我。但我的资产阶级思想相当浓厚，对资本主义留恋不舍。只想到国外去逍遥自在，过资产阶级生活，而不愿在国内任职。一九五○年当邓小平副总理要在重庆安排我的工作时，我以中央贸易部姚依林副部长叫我到美国去有任务为辞不愿接受工作。当姚副部长要委任我在国内工作时，我又以不懂社会主义经营为辞，愿以原来香港公司面貌出现在国外工作。总之，我舍不得原来三千余元的高薪和花园洋屋，过不惯国内的“清淡”生活。一切都从个人利益出发，不是全心全意为人民服务，而是三心二意的走社会主义道路。
    一九五五年我回北京申请公私合营，当时也抱着两种心肠：一方面是经过几年来与党的接触，对党的政策有所认识，从自己的前途着想，想积极与党靠拢；另一方面我在香港经营的企业，正面临着破产的危机，希望合营后国家能拿出钱来替我还债，挽救我的破产。我的愿望，在党的帮助下是完全的实现了。这说明党对于我的照顾真是仁至义尽。
    但是因为我的资产阶级思想还相当浓厚，自高自大，错误地认为自己不需要再脱胎换骨的改造。自认为资本家在社会主义时代只要跟共产党走和共产党合作就行了。资产阶级分子掌握了现代文化技术，工人阶级也需要，因而就产生了美化资产阶级的思想，所以在一九五四年就同意右派分子章乃器的“红色资产阶级”的提法。听别人说资产阶级的丑恶面就不舒服，总认为过甚其辞，以致发展到对工人阶级不服气，认为本企业的工人无可学之处。在第一期社会主义学院招生时，自己就没有报名，不愿参加，思想里认为有党员搞政治，我搞业务就行了，把政治和业务分开看待。
    党的伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，给了我很大教育，在铁的事实面前使我认识了资产
  阶级的丑恶面貌和资产阶级的两面性，给我敲起了警钟，这才明白了资产阶级不进行脱胎换
  骨的改造，就不可能全心全意为人民服务，只能为名利服务。我开始感到我的政治立场和思想已经到了不适应我的地位的情况，因而争取参加了社会主义学院的学习。经过一年的学习，使我在政治上、思想上都有很大的提高。社会主义学院是资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子脱胎换骨的熔炉，是资产阶级分子改造的一个极好场所。设立这样的一个学院，正说明了党对资产阶级分子的关怀。我感谢党使我在这个学院里得到了很大收获。我的收获，大致有以下几点：
    （一）初步克服了走社会主义道路的摇摆思想。如上所述，新中国建国十年来，我虽然跟着党走了十年，但是在三心二意摇摆不定中走过来的。就是在社会主义学院学习中间也还表现过一些摇摆，如对台湾海峡的局势，就有些担心，对敌人的力量估计过高。在参加人民公社的问题上也是因为自己是国家的高级干部不参加不好而报名的，实际上顾虑很多，不愿参加。这一些资产阶级思想，在经过学习、辩论之后，有了一定的认识。首先对社会发展规律有了初步认识，明白了非走社会主义道路不可的道理，认识了共产主义的美满前景。在敌我力量的对比上，学习了毛主席论“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文件和听了周总理、陈副总理报告之后，认识了帝国主义外强中干的本质，注定了它们灭亡的前途，这都有助于我坚定走社会主义道路的决心。
      （二）提高了政治嗅觉，对大是大非初步有所认识。过去由于我的资产阶级立场和思想没有改变，所以对大是大非分辨不清，甚至无能辨别，这是非常危险的。经过一年的学习，使我的政治嗅觉有了提高，对大是大非有所认识。在学习小组讨论中听到不正确的发言也能进行批判，大体上能辨别香花毒草，分清是非界限。
      （三）初步掌握了批评与自我批评的武器。未学习之前我对无产阶级的这个武器完全不会使用。在同志们对我提出批评意见时，虽然表面接受，但心里万分难过。自我批评时也是不敢暴露自己，不深不透。批评别人也是不习惯 的。经过一年的学习锻炼，特别是小组会上的辩论、批评，现在已经能够初步的掌握了这个武器，对自己的一些缺点敢于暴露一些，接受别人的批评时不是过去那样的难过了，也比较虚心一些，对别的同志也敢提一些意见。虽然距离无产阶级的标准还差的很远，但已经能够初步掌握，对于我的继续改造是很大的有利条件。
      （四）初步体验了劳动人民的生活和有了一些劳动观点。过去我是一个从没有参加过体力劳动的人，对工农群众的劳动根本没有体会，甚至是轻视的。这次在学习中我们参加了四季青人民公社的生产劳动，从实际体验中我才真正领会到劳动是不容易的，是伟大的、光荣的，不劳而获是可耻的。同时才真正理解了劳动创造世界的道理。特别使我感动的是有一次与一位女社员共同劳动，她的劳动效率竟比我强十倍，使我感到非常惭愧。经过这一段的劳动，使我对劳动人民的感情有了不少变化，有助于我继续改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    总之，一年多的学习给我很大的收获，使我有了走社会主义道路、进行脱胎换骨自我改造的决心。向党靠拢一大步，认识到一定要听党的话，服从党的领导。虽然我的收获甚大，但距改造成为自食其力的劳动者仍差得甚远。
  但是党已把我引上了一个光明的大道，只要我继续努力不断前进，我相信一定能改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    现在已经回到了工作岗位，我一定要在党的领导下，努力工作，积极学习，继续改造自己。根据毛主席提出的六条政治标准，经常地来衡量自己，批判自己，特别要加强马克思列宁主义理论和毛主席著作的学习，结合自己的思想实际和工作实践，用批评自我批评的方法进行自我改造。以上是我通过一年来学习的一些体会，希望各位委员指正并祝各位委员健康。
