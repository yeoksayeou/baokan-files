    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 1st:  Algerian Republic Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas returned to Cairo this morning after visiting Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon.

    Culture Minister Maidani returned with Prime Minister Abbas.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 1st: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas, in a statement at a press conference held on the evening of April 30th before departing for Cairo, said, "The Algerian people have resolutely decided to continue the struggle until they achieve their goals and are finally liberated from all forms of imperialist control."

    Abbas reiterated his government's willingness to negotiate with France, but such negotiations must be held in a neutral country.

    Speaking about the disputes occurring in some Arab countries, the Prime Minister said: "We never interfere in the painful discords that sometimes occur between their governments. We sincerely hope that the time will come when these discords will end, and brotherhood and harmony will prevail in all regions of the Arab countries."

    Asked whether the discovery of oil in his country would delay the day an agreement with France is reached, Abbas said: "A country's oil is entirely the property of the people of that country."

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 2nd: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Prime Minister Abbas told the "Evening News" reporter: "We are prepared to fight France for another twenty years."

    Prime Minister Abbas said in this interview published in today's "Evening News": "Our fundamental problem is a political problem. So far, we cannot solve the problem through negotiations, so we rely on war to solve the problem."

    Prime Minister Abbas emphasized: "Although we are determined to fight until we achieve freedom and solve our problems, we are not opposed to holding negotiations with France, provided that France should hold negotiations with the Algerian government delegation, the negotiations should address the entire political problem of Algeria, not just as a basis for a ceasefire, and the negotiations should be held in a neutral country."

    阿巴斯总理重申斗争决心
    阿尔及利亚准备战斗二十年
    新华社开罗1日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯在访问了伊拉克、科威特和黎巴嫩以后，今天上午回到开罗。
    和阿巴斯总理一起回到这里的有文化部长迈达尼。
    新华社贝鲁特1日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯在4月30日晚间动身回开罗前夕举行的记者招待会上发表声明说，“阿尔及利亚人民已经断然决定继续进行斗争，直到他们达到目的和最后从各种形式的帝国主义控制下获得解放时为止”。
    阿巴斯重申他的政府愿望同法国进行谈判，但是这种谈判必须在一个中立国家中进行。
    这位总理在谈到一些阿拉伯国家所发生的争端时说：“我们从来不干涉它们政府之间有时所发生的痛苦的不和。我们真诚希望结束这种不和的时候将会到来，兄弟情谊和融洽一致将在阿拉伯国家各地区占统治地位。”
    有人问到，在他的国家中发现石油这件事是否会使同法国达成协议的日子推迟下去，阿巴斯说：“一个国家的石油完全是这个国家人民的财产。”
    新华社开罗2日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯对“晚报”记者说：“我们准备同法国再作战二十年。”
    阿巴斯总理在这篇登载在今天的“晚报”上的谈话中说：“我们的根本问题是政治问题。到目前为止，我们不能通过谈判来解决问题，因此，我们就依靠战争来解决问题。”
    阿巴斯总理强调说：“虽然我们决定战斗到取得自由和解决我们的问题时为止，但是我们不反对同法国举行谈判，条件是：法国应该同阿尔及利亚政府代表团举行谈判，谈判应该处理整个阿尔及利亚的政治问题，而不仅仅是作为停火的基础，谈判应该在中立国家内举行。”
