Xinhua News Agency, 1st of May: On "May Day" night, 160,000 people sang and danced joyously on the brightly lit Tiananmen Square in the capital, celebrating the great leap forward in the country's socialist construction and promising to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day with even more brilliant achievements.

Tiananmen Square was even wider and more magnificent than in previous years. Powerful lights illuminated the entire venue. In the night sky, the colorful beams of searchlights intertwined into dazzling patterns, and white doves of peace flew back and forth. From afar, on East and West Chang'an Avenue, a sea of people waved red flags, and many giant buildings decorated with electric lights looked like majestic pearl pagodas and palaces.

People sang and danced on the square. Many foreign guests couldn't help but step down from the stands and join the workers, students, and children in the festivities.

Workers and students formed countless circles, performing their own original artistic programs. Here, they danced the "Textile Workers' Dance," and there, they sang the "Harvest Song." Students from the Beijing Overseas Chinese Remedial School performed the "Southeast Asian Dance" and the "Arab Unity Dance." Li Baoqin, a famous actress from the Anhui Sizhou Opera, who was performing in Beijing, also spontaneously performed her signature act.

In the dance circle of the workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who had completed their April production tasks ahead of schedule, came a man who was ahead of time – Liao Shigang, a Sichuan Provincial People's Representative and mechanical worker. As soon as the music stopped, the young workers immediately surrounded him, talking about the "daily life" of the Great Leap Forward. Liao Shigang told the young workers that his "secret" to the leap forward was to be "bold, meticulous, and use your brain." Yan Yuwang, a red banner pacesetter in steelmaking, met and shook hands with Liao Shigang. Before Liao Shigang's words of congratulation for the steel workers for a greater leap forward had faded, everyone unanimously shouted with laughter: "Let's leap forward together!"

A burst of applause rang out in the crowd from the Central Institute for Nationalities as the students welcomed two distinguished guests – Yang Zhiming and Deji'er, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and a Tibetan officer, respectively, who had participated in the suppression of the rebellions in Tibet and Kham. Like two magnets, they attracted many Tibetan students and students from other ethnic groups. The young people enthusiastically surrounded them, asking questions one after another, even forgetting the singing and dancing. Wangdui and Wangzha, two Tibetan youths from poor backgrounds, greeted Yang Zhiming. Yang Zhiming told them that the people in their hometown were living peacefully after the rebellion was quelled. More and more people gathered around, and the young people snuggled up to these two relatives, reluctant to leave. An artist was so moved by these scenes that he immediately painted this unforgettable moment.

Xu Jianchun, the female director of the Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong Province, and a National People's Congress representative, was tightly embraced by a group of female students from Beijing Agricultural University as soon as she approached the dance circle. People surrounded her like a stack of arhats, enthusiastically inviting her to give a report at the school. When Xu Jianchun left, the students repeatedly hoped that she could come to Beijing for National Day. Xu Jianchun said modestly, "I hope to come to Beijing for 'October 1st,' but I have to bring 'good things' to come."

The night was deep, and the melodious music still floated over Tiananmen Square. The young people were in high spirits and still singing and dancing to their hearts' content. Others raised colorful flags, beat drums, and played accordions, strolling away from Tiananmen. At this time, in many quiet streets and alleys of the capital, their songs full of youthful vitality could still be heard.

    “五一”之夜
    新华社1日讯　“五一”之夜，在首都灯火辉煌的天安门广场上，十六万人高歌畅舞，欢庆祖国社会主义建设的大跃进，相约以更辉煌的成就来迎接国庆十周年。
    天安门广场比往年更加宽阔壮丽。强力的灯光把全场照得通明。在夜空中，探照灯的五彩光柱交织成绚烂的图案，白色的和平鸽飞来飞去。远远看去，东西长安街上，一片人海，红旗招展，用电灯装饰的许多巨型建筑物好似一座座巍峨的珍珠宝塔和宫殿。
    广场上人们载歌载舞。许多观礼的外宾情不自禁地走下观礼台，同工人、青年学生和孩子们一起联欢。
    工人、学生们围成无数个圆圈，表演着自己创作的文艺节目，这里跳着“纺织工人舞”，那里唱起“丰收歌”。北京华侨补习学校的学生表演了“东南亚舞”和“阿拉伯团结舞”。正在北京演出的安徽泗洲戏著名演员李宝琴等即兴演出了她们的拿手好戏。
    在提前全面完成4月份生产任务的石景山钢铁公司工人的舞圈里，今晚来了一位走在时间前面的人——四川省人民代表、机械工人廖世刚。乐曲声刚停，青年工人们马上就围住他，谈起大跃进的“家常”。廖世刚告诉青年工人们，他的跃进“秘诀”是“胆大，心细，用脑筋”。炼钢红旗手阎玉旺和廖世刚握手相见，廖世刚祝贺钢铁工人更大跃进的话音未落，大家不约而同地齐声笑着喊道：“一起跃进！”
    中央民族学院的人群中响起一阵掌声，同学们迎来了两位贵宾——曾经分别参加过平定西藏、康巴叛乱的人民解放军战士杨治明和藏族军官德吉尔。他们像两块磁石一样，把许多藏族学生和其他民族的学生吸引过来。青年们热情地围着他们，连珠炮般地提出问题，甚至忘掉了歌舞。旺堆和旺扎这两个贫苦出身的藏族青年，向杨治明问好。杨治明告诉他们：叛乱平息后，家乡人民生活很安宁。围拢来的人越来越多，青年们偎依着这两位亲人，舍不得离开。一位美术工作者为这些情景所激动，马上绘下了这难忘的一刻。
    山东省掖县西由人民公社女社长、全国人民代表大会代表徐建春刚走近舞圈，就被北京农业大学一群女学生紧紧拥抱住了，人们像叠罗汉似地重重围着她，热情地邀请她到学校里去作报告。当徐建春离开时，学生们一再希望她能到北京过国庆节，徐建春谦逊地说：“我希望能到北京过‘十一’，可是要带着‘好东西’才能来。”
    夜深了，天安门广场上空，依然飘荡着悦耳的乐曲声，青年们兴致尤浓，还在尽情歌舞。另一些人擎起彩旗，打着鼓，拉着手风琴，漫步离开天安门。这时，在首都许多寂静的街巷里，还可以听到他们充满着青春活力的歌声。
