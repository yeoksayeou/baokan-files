    Daily Output of Phosphate Fertilizer Nears 1,000 Tons
    The Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, our country's first large-scale modern phosphate fertilizer plant which started production in June last year, can now produce nearly 1,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer daily to support agricultural production. Most of the "Changjiang Brand" superphosphate produced by this plant is grade one product containing more than 18% available phosphorus. In the first quarter of this year, the plant produced twice as much phosphate fertilizer as in the second half of last year, and it will produce 330,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer throughout the year.

    日产磷肥近千吨
    去年六月投入生产的我国第一座大型近代化磷肥厂——国营南京磷肥厂，现在每天能够生产近一千吨磷肥，支援农业生产。这个厂生产的“长江牌”过磷酸钙，大部分是含有效磷百分之十八以上的一级品。今年第一季度，这个厂生产了比去年下半年多二倍的磷肥，今年全年将生产三十三万吨磷肥。
