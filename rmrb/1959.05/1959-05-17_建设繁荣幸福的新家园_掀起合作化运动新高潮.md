    Building a Prosperous and Happy New Home
    Launching a New Upsurge in the Cooperative Movement

    (Reported by this newspaper) After the completion of the democratic reform in the rural areas of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, farmers of all ethnic groups have launched a new upsurge in the cooperative movement with great enthusiasm. In the past two months or so, in addition to the Han Chinese area of Luding which had already realized communization, more than 600 agricultural production cooperatives have been established in various parts of the autonomous prefecture. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has increased from 30% to 63% of the total number of peasant households. Driven by the agricultural cooperatives, the people of the whole prefecture are throwing themselves into spring plowing with soaring enthusiasm, striving to increase the total grain output this year compared to last year.

    In the past two months, a moving scene of every household rushing towards cooperation has appeared everywhere in the vast rural areas of the autonomous prefecture in the Kham area. In many counties in the east and north, where the mutual aid and cooperation movement had already started in 1956, more than 90% of the peasants who had not yet joined the cooperatives have also signed up to join; in the southern region, where the democratic reform was only completed at the end of last year, the masses have also actively applied, wanting to greet the establishment of cooperatives with actions of doing a good job in production. People pulled the cadres once, twice, and even five or six times to state their wishes. When discussing the establishment of cooperatives, the farmers of Tuanjie Township in Derong County unanimously proposed, "It is better to do it today than tomorrow, and it is better to do it now than today." All the working people in the township signed up to join the cooperative. After submitting his application, Luorong Yinba, a farmer from Ganzi County, actively worked with the cooperative members in the fields without waiting for approval. Under such circumstances, ten counties including Kangding, Ganzi, and Daofu have rapidly achieved basic cooperation, and in some areas, mutual aid teams have directly transformed into advanced agricultural cooperatives.

    The peasants who have been thoroughly liberated and organized have immediately thrown themselves into spring plowing production with great enthusiasm. They have brought into play their style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and have successively formulated plans for a greater leap forward this year than last year.

    Breaking down feudal conventions and superstitions has become a prominent feature of this year's spring plowing in the autonomous prefecture. In the past, farmers had to "divine" to choose the date for plowing and sowing, and did not work on "auspicious days." Many places dared not build water conservancy projects for fear of cutting off the "dragon vein"; men not carrying manure, women not plowing, and not using manure and urine, and other practices unfavorable to production, have all been swept away. This year, the farmers of Yajiang County broke the superstition of "divination" for sowing, and seized the production season in time, ten to fifteen days earlier than last year. This year, all the women of the Yingguan Cooperative in Kangding County participated in the spring plowing, and 25 women became plowmen.

    In order to ensure the great leap forward in production this year, driven by the broad masses of cooperative members, all localities have generally focused on deep plowing, increasing fertilizer application, rational close planting, and building water conservancy projects to vigorously improve farming techniques. In many areas, farmers began to work in the fields before the ice and snow had completely melted. In the booming movement of accumulating fertilizer and sowing, a new atmosphere of men, women, old and young, all going into battle appeared everywhere, with an attendance rate of over 90%. The farmers of Bajiaolou Township in Yajiang County carried bedding and rations to live in the high mountains to accumulate fertilizer, crossed peaks of three or four thousand meters, and crossed the rapids of the Yalong River to find fertilizer sources. The farmers of Wangbuding Township in Dege County used ropes to hang from cliffs into caves to collect bird droppings. Farmers in various places also universally launched mass red flag competitions. According to reports from various places, the average fertilizer application per mu of cultivated land in the whole prefecture this year is about 7,000 jin, more than double that of last year, and the area of cultivated land fertilized has increased from 40% of the total area in the past to about 80%; deep plowing has increased from about three inches in the past to more than five inches, and high-yield fields have reached more than one foot; the amount of seeds used has increased by half compared to last year, averaging about 30 jin per mu; the area of irrigation has reached half of the cultivated land area, expanding two times that of last year.

    Since the autonomous prefecture began to carry out democratic reforms in batches in 1956, it has victoriously ended in the rural areas of the entire prefecture by the end of last year. With the progress of the reform work, mutual aid and cooperation movements have been carried out successively in various places. By the end of last year, more than 600 small agricultural cooperatives (including some advanced cooperatives) had been established in the whole prefecture. These agricultural cooperatives have shown great superiority over individual farming in the past two years. According to statistics from Kangding and Danba counties, more than 80% of the cooperatives have caught up with or exceeded the production and living standards of local wealthy peasants within one or two years. Last year, many places in the prefecture increased production by 19.6% under conditions of unprecedented drought, while some counties with better cooperative movements increased production by 30% to 40%. In the past two years, farmers from various places in the autonomous prefecture have also continuously gone to the interior to learn from the experience of running cooperatives and visit the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, which has been greatly encouraged and educated. Since the democratic reform, the peasants liberated from the feudal serf system have been eager to organize because of the extreme lack of means of production. All of this has converged into the foundation of this upsurge of the cooperative movement. (Yu Jingqi, Li Desen)

    建设繁荣幸福的新家园
    掀起合作化运动新高潮
    本报讯　四川的甘孜藏族自治州各族农民，在全州农村完成民主改革后，掀起了热火朝天的合作化运动新高潮。最近两个多月来，自治州除泸定汉族地区早已实现公社化以外，各地建成了农业生产合作社六百多个，入社农户由占总农户的30％增加到63％。在农业社带动下，全州人民正以冲天干劲投入春耕生产，力争今年粮食总产量比去年增产。
    在这两个多月中，在康巴地区的自治州的广大农村里，到处出现了家家户户奔向合作化的动人景象。在1956年就已开展了互助合作运动的东部、北部许多县，90％以上的未入社农民，也都纷纷报名要求入社；去年年底才完成民主改革的南部地区，广大群众也积极提出申请，要以搞好生产的行动迎接建社。人们拉着干部一次、两次，甚至五六次地申述自己的心愿。得荣县团结乡农民在讨论建社时一致提出，“明天办不如今天办，今天办不如马上办”，全乡劳动人民都报名入了社。甘孜县农民洛绒银巴提出申请后，不等批准就积极和社员们一块下地劳动。在这种情况下，康定、甘孜、道孚等十个县都迅速基本上实现了合作化，有些地区的互助组直接转为高级农业社。
    获得了彻底解放并组织起来的农民，立即以高度的热情投入春耕生产。他们发挥了敢想敢说敢做的风格，纷纷订出今年比去年更大跃进的计划。
    破除封建的陈规陋习和迷信思想，成为今年自治州春耕中突出的特点。过去，农民们犁地、下种都要“打卦”选择日期，“忌日”不出工，许多地方不敢修水利，怕挖断“龙脉”；男不背屎、女不犁地、不用屎尿等等不利于生产的做法，都一扫而光。雅江县农民今年破除了“打卦”下种的迷信，就及时抓住了生产季节，比去年提早了十天到十五天。康定县营官社的妇女，今年就全部参加了春耕，并且有二十五个妇女当了步犁手。
    为了保证今年生产的大跃进，在广大社员们带动下，各地普遍以深耕、增施肥料、合理密植、兴修水利为中心，大力改进耕作技术。许多地区农民不等冰雪全消就开始下地。在轰轰烈烈的积肥运动和播种工作中，到处出现男女老少齐上阵的新气象，出勤率达90％以上。雅江县八角楼乡农民带着铺盖、口粮住到高山上积肥，翻过三四千公尺的高峰，渡过雅砻江急流去寻找肥源。德格县汪布顶乡农民用绳子从悬崖上吊到山洞里去取鸟粪。各地农民还普遍展开了群众性的红旗竞赛。据各地报告，全州今年每亩耕地平均施肥七千斤左右，比去年增加两倍多，施肥的耕地面积由过去占总面积的40％，上升到80％左右；深耕从过去的三寸左右增加到五寸以上，高产田达到一尺以上，用种量比去年增加一半，平均每亩三十斤左右；水利灌溉面积已达到耕地面积的一半，比去年扩大两倍。
    自治州从1956年开始分批进行民主改革以来，到去年年底，在全州农村已胜利结束。随着改革工作的进展，各地先后开展了互助合作运动。到去年年底，全州共建立了六百多个较小的农业社（包括部分高级社）。这些农业社在过去两年中显示了比单干的巨大优越性。据康定、丹巴两县统计，有80％多的社在一年或两年内就赶上或超过了当地富裕农民的生产和生活水平。去年，全州许多地方在空前干旱的条件下，增产了19.6％，而一些合作化运动较好的县则增产了30％至40％。两年来，自治州各地农民还不断到内地学习办社经验，参观大跃进的成就，受到很大鼓舞和教育；自民主改革后，从封建农奴制度下解放的农民，他们因生产资料十分缺乏，迫切要求组织起来。这一切就汇合成为这次合作化运动高潮的基础。（于竞祁、李德森）
