Comrades,

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC. These two reports are very comprehensive and detailed, and we should study them for a long time and implement them in practice.

Through the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the people's political enthusiasm for building socialism has been greatly stimulated. Now it can be affirmed that under the leadership of the Party, all aspects of work have achieved great results. In colleges and universities, the mental outlook of teachers and students has undergone profound changes. The Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor has taken root in the hearts of the people. The quality of education has been improved, scientific research work has been unfolded, and the bases for the integration of teaching, scientific research, and production have been initially established. At present, many colleges and universities have formed a new situation of overall leap forward with focus on improvement. Under such circumstances, one of the main tasks of colleges and universities is to continue to vigorously carry out scientific research work, on the one hand, to improve the quality of teaching, and on the other hand, to serve economic construction and national defense construction. At present, the equipment and processing capacity required for carrying out scientific research work in the nationwide Great Leap Forward are very tight. Harbin Institute of Technology has had the following experiences in the past year of large-scale communist scientific research cooperation with factories and enterprises:

(1) In colleges and universities, organize personnel from various teaching and research departments to cooperate in completing the tasks of socialist construction.

Under the principle of the whole country as a chessboard, it is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary tasks, grasp the major projects in socialist construction and the key problems in production, formulate scientific research plans, organize the technical forces of many relevant majors in colleges and universities, mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, and cooperate to ensure that the various tasks in the plan are reliably implemented. For example, when Harbin Institute of Technology was conducting capacity argumentation for the water turbine generator units of the Yangtze River Three Gorges water conservancy project, due to the wide range of business involved, it organized more than forty teachers from twenty teaching and research departments of seven departments to cooperate in the division of labor, and achieved preliminary results.

(2) Further strengthen close cooperation with factories

Facts have proved that only through the cooperation between factories and schools can scientific research work better serve socialist construction, the technical strength and equipment capacity of schools be fully utilized, and the combination of theory and practice, the combination of physical and mental labor, and the combination of intellectuals and working people be facilitated, which is conducive to implementing the educational policy of combining education with productive labor. In the cooperation between schools and factories, the methods that should be adopted are: 1. Cooperate and help each other to tackle the cutting edge together. For example, the cooperation between teachers and students of the electrical engineering major of Harbin Institute of Technology and Shenyang Transformer Factory in trial-producing the new 330,000-volt ultra-high-voltage current transformer is a good example. Teachers and students of the electrical engineering major and the factory are both preparing to present gifts for the "Eleventh" National Day, so the two sides helped and cooperated with each other. As a result, the "leading cadres, workers, technicians, teachers, and students" five-in-one situation under the leadership of the Party committee was quickly formed in the factory, and a tackling team was established, which successively completed the design of nine product modification designs, and finally made the transformer. 2. Complement each other and exchange what they have. Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant originally planned to produce an electronic tube copying vertical lathe by the end of last year, but lacked technical strength in electric power transmission. Teachers and students of the industrial enterprise electrification major of Harbin Institute of Technology also wanted to trial-produce the control part of this product. After the cooperation between the factory and the school, thirty-seven teachers and students went deep into the factory and worked with workers and technicians to successfully trial-produce it in less than three months. 3. Summarize the advanced experience of workers in the technical revolution. Workers of Harbin Machine Union Factory created the "building block" machine tool in the technical revolution, opening up a new direction for machine tool manufacturing. Teachers and students of the mechanical manufacturing technology major of Harbin Institute of Technology took workers as teachers, and together with the workers, summarized these experiences, enriched the course content, improved the quality of teaching, and on this basis, jointly completed a set of experimental designs for "building block" machine tools.

(3) Strengthen cooperation between colleges and universities, research institutions, and enterprise departments

In order to accelerate the speed of our socialist construction and make our science and technology continuously develop, we must also unite the technical forces and equipment of colleges and universities, research institutions, and enterprise departments to cooperate in order to complete the task more, faster, better, and more economically. Some projects can be solved by concentrating the manpower and material resources of all relevant parties without requiring a lot of equipment and processing power. These works should be organized and carried out immediately. For example, when the Yangtze River Three Gorges power system is running jointly with many other power systems in our country, it must realize automation and remote control. This requires designing high-frequency channels in the power system. Harbin Institute of Technology, together with the Technical Improvement Bureau, the Power Management Bureau and other enterprise organizations, used the existing instruments and equipment of all parties to carry out high-frequency parameter testing in the existing power system, laying a preliminary foundation for the relevant design of the Three Gorges system. This kind of work can make achievements in socialist construction as long as several parties cooperate.

(4) Promote scientific research cooperation among colleges and universities

In colleges and universities, especially among neighboring colleges and universities, there are many projects that can be jointly researched. In terms of technical strength and equipment, they can complement and support each other, so that they can carry out research on projects that cannot be completed or completed very slowly when they are alone. This is also one of the main ways to carry out scientific research work more, faster, better, and more economically.

Under the leadership of the Party, let us give play to the spirit of communist collaboration, advocate being down-to-earth, working hard, striving for practical results, not pursuing vanity, and striving for greater research results.

    加强科学研究工作的大协作
    朱物华委员谈哈尔滨工业大学的经验各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席所作的政协工作报告。这两个报告非常全面而细致，我们应该长期的进行学习，并贯彻到实践中去。
    通过整风和反右派斗争，大大激发了全国人民建设社会主义的政治热情。现在可以肯定：在党的领导下，各方面的工作都已取得很大的成绩。在高等学校方面，广大师生的精神面貌已经发生了深刻的变化，党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针已深入人心，教育质量提高了，科学研究工作展开了，教学、科学研究和生产三结合的基地初步搞起来了。目前许多高等学校已经形成了一个全面跃进重点提高的新局面。在这种情况下，高等学校主要工作之一就是继续大力开展科学研究工作，一方面提高教学质量，一方面为经济建设和国防建设服务。在目前全国大跃进开展科学研究工作所需的器材设备和加工力量都非常紧张的情况下，在哈尔滨工业大学经过去年和工厂、企业进行共产主义科学研究工作大协作中有如下几点体会：
    （1）在高等学校中，组织各教研室的人员共同协作完成所承担的社会主义建设任务
    在全国一盘棋的原则下，必须分清主次，抓住社会主义建设中的重大项目以及生产中的关键性问题，订好科学研究规划，组织高等学校中许多有关专业的技术力量，发动大家的积极性，共同协作，使规划中的各项工作落实可靠。例如，哈尔滨工业大学在进行长江三峡水利枢纽水轮机组的容量论证工作时，由于牵涉业务范围较广，组织了七个系二十几个教研室的四十多名教师分工协作，得到了初步的成果。
    （2）进一步加强和工厂密切合作
    事实证明，只有通过工厂和学校的协作，才能使科学研究工作更直接地为社会主义建设服务，使学校的技术力量和设备能力得到充分的发挥，并有利于理论与实践的结合，体力劳动与脑力劳动的结合，知识分子与劳动人民的结合，有利于贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。在学校同工厂的合作中，应当采取的方式是：1．合作互助，一起猛攻尖端。如哈尔滨工业大学电器专业师生与沈阳变压器厂合作试制新型三十三万伏超高压电流互感器就是很好的例子。电器专业师生和工厂都准备在“十一”献礼，所以双方互助合作，结果在工厂很快就形成了党委领导下的“领导干部、工人、技术人员、教师、学生”五结合的局面，成立了攻尖队，先后完成了九种产品改型设计，最后制成了互感器。2．相辅相成，互通有无。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂原定去年年底制出电子管仿型立式车床，但缺少电力传动方面的技术力量，哈尔滨工业大学工业企业电气化专业师生也要试制这种产品的控制部分。厂校协作后，三十七名师生深入工厂，与工人、技术人员一起，不到三个月就试制成功了。3．总结工人在技术革命中的先进经验。哈尔滨机联厂工人在技术革命中创造了“积木式”机床，开辟了机床制造的新方向。哈尔滨工业大学机械制造工艺专业师生拜工人为师，与工人一起总结了这些经验，充实了课程内容，提高了教学质量，并在此基础上，共同完成了一套“积木式”机床的试验设计。
    （3）加强高等学校和研究机构与企业部门的合作
    为了加速我国社会主义建设的速度，使我国科学技术不断地向前发展，还必须把高等学校研究机构和企业部门的技术力量和设备联合起来协作，才能多快好省地完成任务。有一些项目只需集中各有关方面的人力和物力而不需很多的器材和加工力量就可以解决。这些工作目前尤应立即组织进行。例如长江三峡电力系统在和我国许多其他电力系统联合运行时，必须实现自动化和远动化。这就需要在电力系统中设计高频通道。哈尔滨工业大学和技术改进局、电管局等企业机构联合起来，利用了各方面现有的仪器设备在现有电力系统中进行了高频参数测试工作，为三峡系统有关设计打下初步基础。这种工作只要几方面的协作就可以对社会主义建设作出成绩。
    （4）促进高等学校间科学研究工作的协作
    在高等学校方面，尤其是在邻近的高等学校间，有许多可以联合起来共同研究的项目。在技术力量和设备方面都可以相互补充，互相支援，这样就可以进行单独时不能完成或完成很慢的项目的研究。这也是多快好省进行科学研究工作的主要方式之一。
    让我们在党的领导下，发挥共产主义大协作的精神，提倡踏踏实实，埋头苦干，力求实效，不务虚名，争取更大的研究成果。
