　　Rapeseed Pods Are Turning Yellow, Large-Scale Bumper Harvests Are in Sight
    Zhongxian Farmers Strengthen Late-Stage Management of Rapeseed
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 9th dispatch) A scene of large-scale, high-yield rapeseed harvests is appearing in the undulating fields of Zhongxian County, Sichuan Province. Farmers throughout the county, filled with joy, are seizing the time for final rapeseed management and busily preparing for the harvest.
    Zhongxian County was famous last year for its large-scale, high-yield rapeseed, especially the "Rapeseed King" sent to the Beijing exhibition, which was renowned far and wide. At the beginning of this year, the county, based on its large-scale, high-yield rapeseed, launched a bumper harvest competition challenge to the entire province.
    On the eve of the harvest, this reporter arrived in Zhongxian County. Upon entering the county, it was clear that this year's rapeseed harvest here would be extraordinary: every field of rapeseed resembled a high-yield plot, growing neatly and densely; each plant was as strong as a small tree, with heavy pods bending the branches into arcs, supported by farmers with frames or bamboo poles. In some rapeseed gardens, the rapeseed grew so tall that farmers had to bend over and crawl through to pick and remove the withered yellow leaves at the base. In the rapeseed garden of Bashan Commune, two technical cadres who were touring with me spent nearly half an hour just counting the number of pods on one rapeseed plant. In the women's experimental field of this commune, I met Tang Yunzhen, the management team leader, who was working with her team members to apply fertilizer to the rapeseed. She said that this was already the eighteenth application of fertilizer. Due to the proper application of fertilizer, more than half of the branches in this rapeseed field have pods all the way to the tip, which alone can increase production by about 20%. Tang Yunzhen readily pulled over a branch full of pods to show me, with dense pods all the way to the top. She said that this application of fertilizer was to ensure that the pods at the top were full of seeds and heavy. Zhang Yuqing, the county party secretary who accompanied us on the tour, said that rapeseed of this quality could be seen in every commune.
    The largest "Rapeseed King" at last year's National Agricultural Exhibition was produced in Zhongxian County, and many people marveled at it as a miracle. However, that kind of rapeseed cannot be called "King" in Zhongxian this year. This year, clusters of single rapeseed plants can be seen everywhere in Zhongxian County. Because they grow tall and large, people call them "Big Nest Rapeseed." A new "Rapeseed King" has already emerged, cultivated by Ding Dezhen, a female commune member of Bashan Commune. This rapeseed plant is seven and a half feet tall, with more than 120,000 pods on more than 1,460 branches, resembling a tree. Compared to it, last year's "Rapeseed King" has to concede defeat. This year, the people of the county have utilized the empty and barren land in front of and behind houses, and along field ridges, to plant more than three million "Big Nest Rapeseed" plants, forming a high tide of "everyone cultivating Rapeseed Kings." The person in charge of the county committee told me that, according to estimates, the rapeseed produced by "Big Nest Rapeseed" alone will be equivalent to one-third of the total rapeseed production last year.
    With nearly half a month before the harvest, farmers throughout the county have already begun intense harvest preparations. Many experienced male and female farmers are selecting seeds in the rapeseed fields. They select thick, long branches with full pods all the way to the tip, and mark them so that they can be threshed and stored separately as improved seeds for autumn planting. Faced with an unprecedented bumper harvest, farmers throughout the county are busy organizing manpower and preparing tools to ensure that they are harvested well, dried well, and stored well. Everywhere, people are burning lime to repair drying yards, making drying racks and furniture for storing rapeseed. Many commune members are voluntarily vacating extra houses to store rapeseed. Dongyun Commune specifically convened a forum of cadres and experienced farmers to study the issues of careful harvesting and threshing, established harvest professional groups, quality inspection groups, and storage groups, and launched a rapeseed harvest competition movement. On the eve of the harvest, commune members composed a song that goes:
        Rapeseed pods are quickly turning yellow, a joyful scene of a bumper harvest,
        Everyone is preparing to go to the battlefield, everyone is busy for the bumper harvest.

### 油菜籽荚快变黄  大面积丰收在望  忠县农民加强油菜后期管理

　　油菜籽荚快变黄  大面积丰收在望
    忠县农民加强油菜后期管理
    本报成都9日电　油菜大面积高产丰收的景象，出现在四川省忠县山峦起伏的田野。全县农民正怀着喜悦的心情，抓紧油菜最后管理，忙着准备收获。
    忠县，去年曾以油菜大面积高产而著名，尤其是那株送往北京展览的“油菜王”，更是驰名远近。今年年初，这个县又以油菜大面积高产为条件，向全省发起了丰产竞赛挑战。
    丰收前夕，记者来到忠县。一进县境，就能看出今年这里的油菜收成定不平凡：块块油菜都像高额丰产田，生长得整齐茂密；株株茁壮得像小树一样，累累的籽荚将枝桠压得弯成弓形，农民搭架或用竹杆支撑起来。有些油菜园里的油菜因为长得特别高，农民们就躬着腰钻进去摘打枯黄脚叶，在底下穿来穿去。在拔山公社的油菜园里，和我一起参观的两位技术干部，为了将一株油菜的荚数清，用了将近半小时之久。在这个公社妇女试验田里，遇到管理组长唐云贞，她正和组员们一道给油菜追肥。她说，这已是施第十八次追肥了，由于追肥适当，这块油菜占一半以上的枝桠都作到籽荚满尖，仅这一项就能增产20％左右。唐云贞顺手拉过一枝满尖的枝条给我看，密密的果荚直到顶端，她说这次追肥就是为了使顶端的荚满籽重。陪同参观的县委书记张玉庆说，像这样好的油菜，在每个公社里都能见到。
    去年全国农展会上最大的一株“油菜王”，是忠县出产的，多少人曾惊叹那是一个奇迹。但，那样的油菜今年在忠县已不能称“王”了。今年，在忠县各处就能看到一簇簇的单株油菜，因为长得高大，人们称作“大窝油菜”。一株新的“油菜王”已经露面，还是拔山公社女社员丁德珍培植的一株大窝油菜。这株油菜茎高七尺半，在大小一千四百六十多根分枝上，结满十二万多个荚，像一株树似的。和它比起来，去年的“油菜王”只好甘拜下风了。全县人民今年利用屋前屋后、田坎地角的空土荒地，共种植了三百多万棵大窝油菜，形成一个“人人培植油菜王”的高潮。县委会的负责人告诉我，据估计，仅大窝油菜一项可产的菜籽，就相当于去年油菜籽总产量的三分之一。
    离收获时间还有近半个月，全县农民就已展开了紧张的收获准备工作。许多有经验的男女农民，正在油菜地里选种。他们选出又粗又长结荚满尖的枝条，在上面作出记号，以便将来单打单藏，作为良种，准备秋种时使用。面对着空前的丰收，全县农民忙着组织人力，准备工具，以便作到收好、晒好、藏好。到处都在烧石灰修晒坝、制作晒架和盛菜籽的家具，许多公社社员自愿把多余的房子腾出来贮藏菜籽。东云公社专门召开了干部、老农座谈会，研究细收、细打问题，成立收获专业小组、质量检查小组和保管小组，并开展油菜收获评比运动。社员们在丰收前夕编了歌唱道：
        菜籽荚荚快变黄，丰收景象喜洋洋，
        人人准备上战场，个个都为丰收忙。
