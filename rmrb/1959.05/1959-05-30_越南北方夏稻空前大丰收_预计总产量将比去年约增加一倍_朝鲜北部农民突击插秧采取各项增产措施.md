Hanoi, May 29 (report from our newspaper) An unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice has been achieved in North Vietnam, with total output estimated to double that of last year.

Following the bumper harvest of autumn rice last year, the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government put forward the slogan in early winter: to make the unit area yield of early rice this year catch up with that of autumn rice last year (which averaged 2.3 tons per hectare) and to increase the target for the total output of early rice this year to 1.99 million tons, doubling last year's (last year's total output of early rice was 1 million tons). According to the Vietnamese national plan, the annual rice output in North Vietnam this year is required to reach more than 6.2 million tons, with early rice increasing by about 99% compared to last year, and autumn rice increasing by about 22% compared to last year.

Thanks to the efforts of all the people in North Vietnam for half a year, especially as a result of the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement since last winter and spring, the water and fertilizer for the paddy fields have been guaranteed. At the same time, better results have been achieved in deep plowing and close planting than in the autumn crop last year. Therefore, although this year's early rice encountered the most serious drought since the restoration of peace, and storms were encountered when the rice matured (estimated to result in a loss of 10%-20%), it still seems that the national plan target can be successfully achieved.

In Guangping, Hejing, Yian and other provinces near the dividing line, and the Yongling District, the early harvest has been basically completed, and the unit area yield per hectare has increased by 60%-500% compared with last year's early rice. The highest yield reached 9.5 tons per hectare.

In Thanh Hoa Province, a famous province in central North Vietnam, although it suffered heavy losses from storms blowing from Laos, the unit area yield of harvested rice was also 35%-400% higher than that of last year's early rice, with the highest yield reaching 6.8 tons per hectare.

The proportion of increase in early rice production in the Red River Delta and the mountainous areas of North Vietnam is generally no worse than that of Thanh Hoa Province. From the dividing line to the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam, the unit area yield of early rice in many places has exceeded that of last year's autumn rice.

At present, the early harvest in North Vietnam has not yet been completed, and autumn plowing has already begun. While vigorously developing agricultural cooperatives in conjunction with the early harvest, the provinces are also arranging production competitions for the autumn crop.

The people of North Vietnam, who have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice, are now confident that they can reach or even exceed the highest level of total rice production in the whole of Vietnam (including South Vietnam) before the war in 1939 (6.5 million tons) this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 28th. North Korean farmers are currently rushing to transplant rice seedlings.

According to statistics from the North Korean Ministry of Agriculture, by May 20, one-third of all paddy fields in northern Korea had been transplanted with rice seedlings. At present, farmers in various places and the transplanting army composed of students, cadres, soldiers, and workers who are helping with transplanting are enthusiastically launching a transplanting competition.

This year, reasonable close planting has been implemented for rice in North Korea, with an average of 250 seedlings planted per pyong (200 pyong is equivalent to one Chinese mu), an increase of one and a half times the density of last year. However, in many places, each person can still transplant 200 to 300 pyong per day. In order to improve the efficiency of transplanting, farmers in Jiangnan County have also created rice transplanters.

In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, North Korean farmers have taken measures such as expanding irrigation area, increasing fertilizer application, and deep plowing. The irrigation projects built last winter and this spring have already expanded the irrigation area by 350,000 choppu that were already released for water this spring, equivalent to the total expansion of irrigation area in the thirteen years from liberation to September last year. Several times more fertilizer was accumulated last winter and this spring than in previous years. Changqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangnan County applied an average of 600 tons of fertilizer per choppu of paddy field and 300 tons of fertilizer per choppu of dry land. During this year's spring plowing, most places have generally met the requirement of deep plowing to 30 centimeters.

### 越南北方夏稻空前大丰收  预计总产量将比去年约增加一倍  朝鲜北部农民突击插秧采取各项增产措施

    越南北方夏稻空前大丰收
    预计总产量将比去年约增加一倍
    朝鲜北部农民突击插秧采取各项增产措施
    本报河内29日电　越南北方夏稻空前丰收，估计总产量将比去年翻一番。
    在去年秋稻大丰收之后，越南劳动党和政府在去年冬初曾经提出口号：要求今年夏稻单位面积产量赶上去年秋稻（去年每公顷平均是二点三吨）并且把今年夏稻总产量的指标，比去年（去年夏稻总产量是一百万吨）提高一倍，达到一百九十九万多吨。根据越南国家计划，今年北越全年稻谷产量要求达到六百二十万吨以上，其中夏稻比去年增长99％左右；秋稻比去年增长22％左右。
    经过越南北方全体人民半年的努力，特别是由于去冬今春以来互助合作运动大发展的结果，保证了稻田的水、肥，同时在深耕、密植方面也都比去年秋造搞得更好，因此，尽管今年夏稻遇到了和平恢复以来最严重的旱情，稻谷成熟时又遇到风暴（估计要损失10％—20％），但是从目前情况看来，仍能胜利实现国家计划指标。
    靠近分界线的广平、河静、宜安等省和永灵区，夏收已基本完成，每公顷单位面积产量比去年夏稻增加了60％—500％。最高产量一公顷达到九吨半。
    北越中部著名的清化省，虽然受到从老挝吹过来的风暴的袭击损失较重，但已收的稻谷单位面积产量也比去年夏稻多35％—400％，最高产量一公顷达六点八吨。
    红河三角洲和北越山区的夏稻产量增长的比例一般也都不差于清化省。从分界线到越北山区，许多地方夏稻单位面积产量已超过去年的秋稻。
  目前，越南北方夏收还没有完毕，而秋耕已经开始，各省在结合夏收大力发展农业合作社的同时，正在纷纷布置秋造的生产竞赛。
    取得了夏稻空前丰产的北越人民，目前有信心在今年之内，使北越稻谷产量达到甚至超过战前全越南（包括南越）稻谷总产量最高的1939年（六百五十万吨）的水平。
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜北部农民目前正在突击插秧。
    据朝鲜农业省的统计，到5月20日为止，朝鲜北部的全部水田已有三分之一插完了秧，目前，各地农民和帮助插秧的学生、干部、军人和工人组成的插秧大军，正在热烈地展开插秧竞赛。
    今年朝鲜的水稻实行了合理的密植，平均每坪（二百坪为一华亩）插秧二百五十窝，比去年的密度增加了一倍半。但是许多地方每人每天仍能够插秧二百到三百坪。为了提高插秧的效率，江南郡的农民还创造了插秧机。
    朝鲜农民为了争取今年更大的丰收，采取了扩大灌溉面积、增施肥料和深耕等措施。去冬今春兴修的灌溉工程中已经在今春放水的部分就扩大了三十五万町步灌溉面积，相当于解放后到去年9月为止的十三年来扩大灌溉面积的总和。去冬今春所积的肥料比往年多几倍。江南郡长桥农业社在每町步水田中平均施肥六百吨，旱田每町步施肥三百吨。今年春耕时，各地一般都达到了深耕三十公分的要求。
