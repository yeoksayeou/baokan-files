    The Rebirth of Lhasa
    Li Zhenyu, Cameraman of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio
    In previous years, March in Lhasa was already a time of bright spring sunshine, but this year was different. Days of overcast snow, coupled with the disaster created for the people of Lhasa by a small group of upper-class Tibetan traitors, left Lhasa in a suffocating atmosphere.
    The rebel elements threatened and enticed officials of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan people to participate in the rebellion. But those officials loyal to the motherland, those Tibetan people who understood righteousness, avoided them like the plague, moving their families to live near the People's Liberation Army troops, or simply moving into the courtyards where the offices or troops were stationed. The officers and soldiers and cadres of the troops treated those who came to take refuge like relatives, arranging for them to live in office dormitories, office buildings, and meeting rooms. When these houses were full, they gave their own dormitories to the guests, and set up tents to live in themselves.
    On the night of March 17, the Dalai Lama was abducted from Lhasa by the rebels. On the night of March 19, the rebels launched a full-scale attack on the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa. Our army had no choice but to fight back, and wiped out this small group of reactionary rebels in one fell swoop. The dark clouds over Lhasa were quickly blown away by the east wind, and the sun shone brightly in the "City of Sunlight." The following fragments are my personal experiences and observations at the time.
    In Front of the Camera
    After the rebellion began, the "tigresses" among the reactionary elements of the Tibetan upper class also strutted onto the streets. They forced some women to attend "meetings" and "demonstrations." Those honest and kind Tibetan women really had no way to express their suffering. The inner pain of people being forced to do things they knew were wrong, but had to do, is imaginable.
    In those days, we often carried our cameras, risking our lives to go to the streets to film the materials of those rebel elements causing trouble.
    I saw a so-called "women's congress" held by the rebels in front of the Potala Palace. Hundreds of Tibetan working women were surrounded by armed rebels like prisoners, some coaxing crying children, some thinking sadly. There was no presidium at this congress; only a few powdered and painted aristocratic women were conspiring in a secretive manner. Then a middle-aged woman dressed in gorgeous aristocratic clothes with a rough face stood up, raised her hand and barked like a dog. She seemed to be leading the women to shout slogans, but to her disappointment, only a few aristocratic women were following her. The mouths of the Tibetan working women didn't even move, and some didn't even raise their heads.
    Then, those women who were forced to participate in the parade walked slowly under the coercion of the armed rebels. When those leading "tigresses" encountered the camera lens pointed at them, they either turned their faces away to avoid it, or covered half their faces and cursed as they ran away from the lens. It is clear that these guys also knew that what they were doing was disgraceful.
    On March 22, we followed the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Potala Palace. In addition to filming, we also worked on accepting surrenders. Among the group of prisoners, a rebel with a face full of pockmarks was spotted by us at a glance and immediately pulled out of the group. I asked him:
    "Mu Xia, do you still recognize me?" The rebel was stunned for a long time, then mumbled and shook his head, saying he didn't recognize me. "Don't recognize me? Humph! My camera recognizes you!" It turned out that this pockmarked man was called Xini Mu Xia. In the past, during the campaign to liberate Qamdo, he was a Daiben (regimental commander) of the Tibetan army. This guy was taken prisoner at that time, and we had filmed his surrender. Later, the People's Liberation Army released him based on a lenient policy. Not only did he not repent, but he repaid kindness with revenge and participated in this rebellion again. Although this guy had experience as a prisoner, he was at a loss in front of the film camera lens and dared not raise his head.
  The Tibetan People Firmly Follow the Communist Party
    On March 15, Lhasa's government cadres and patriotic progressive Tibetan officials formed a propaganda team, risking being attacked by the rebels, and went deep into the streets and alleys to expose the rebellion plots of the rebel elements to the masses. In a remote street, people quickly gathered. When the propaganda team recounted the good deeds done by the Communist Party and the Central People's Government for the Tibetan people, some women recalled their own experiences and could not help but shed tears of emotion. A woman in her thirties, Jiangyang Namu, hugged a four or five-year-old boy and said to the people, "Any conscientious Tibetan will not leave the Communist Party. The good deeds done by the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are countless! My son and I were saved by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." It turned out that four or five years ago, this woman was a poor person who set up a small stall and worked as a small vendor on the street. When she gave birth to this child, she encountered a dystocia. Fortunately, the hospital established by the government saved her and her son's lives. The doctors operated on the pregnant woman all night, transfusing their own fresh blood to the pregnant woman who had lost too much blood.
    When the propaganda team set off, two Tibetan soldiers followed behind. When the propaganda team began to conduct propaganda, the two Tibetan soldiers disrupted the proceedings from the side. But slowly, after listening to the propaganda twice, one of the Tibetan soldiers sneaked away; the remaining Tibetan soldier became a volunteer inspector in the propaganda team. Not only did he not disrupt the activities of the propaganda team, but he helped the propaganda team maintain order at the meeting.
    When the propaganda team finished speaking, they said to the masses: Compatriots! Think about who you want to follow? Do you want to follow the reactionaries on the dead end of suffering, or do you want to follow the Communist Party on the bright and happy socialist road? The excited people shouted in one voice: Firmly follow the Communist Party! The Tibetan soldier who had been influenced also clenched the British-made rifle in his hand and shouted the same voice as the masses.
  The Army and the People are as Close as One Family
    After the rebellion was quelled, the citizens of Lhasa actively helped the People's Liberation Army with various tasks. Some rebels threw guns and ammunition into toilets and stinky ditches before they fled. After the rebellion was quelled, many people immediately reported to the People's Liberation Army or automatically picked up the weapons and sent them to the People's Liberation Army garrison after discovering them.
    In a garrison of the Military Control Commission's work team, the following incident occurred: The team members were busy day and night collecting weapons, publicizing the Party's policies, and distributing relief grain. They took off their dirty clothes and soaked them in a basin for several days without having time to wash them. One day, a team member's clothes soaked in the basin were washed, dried, and folded neatly without anyone knowing. This comrade asked others who had helped him wash his clothes, but everyone said they didn't know. He called his lover, but his lover had not come to him at all. Then, some team members' clothes soaked in the basin were also washed and dried. Later, they discovered that it was an old Tibetan woman living in the same courtyard who had secretly washed them for them. When they gave the old woman laundry money, it made the old woman very angry. The old woman said, "You work hard day and night for us, and I wash your clothes for you. You still come to give money. What kind of rule is this?" The comrades explained to her that they should abide by the mass discipline. The old woman argued, "My discipline is to help you wash clothes, and you are not allowed to give money."
    New Life Begins
    When the rebellion began, the Jokhang Temple was one of the important strongholds occupied by the bandits. They built fortifications on the roof of the Jokhang Temple, dug through the walls inside the temple to make shooting holes, and fired at the Trade Company, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, and other places. If this bandit-occupied place was not removed, the threat to us would be considerable. The bandits in the Jokhang Temple knew that the People's Liberation Army would try its best to protect cultural relics and historical sites during combat. They seized on this point and held on to the Jokhang Temple. The People's Liberation Army did not fire a single shot at the Jokhang Temple when counterattacking the bandits inside the Jokhang Temple. In order to eliminate the bandits in the Jokhang Temple, the People's Liberation Army soldiers bravely counterattacked the bandits. On the morning of March 22, the Jokhang Temple was finally liberated. When we entered the Jokhang Temple with the People's Liberation Army troops, we saw fortifications built by the bandits everywhere, and bullet casings and ammunition boxes everywhere after the shooting. The rebels also defecated and urinated everywhere in the scripture halls and in front of the Buddha statues, making the Jokhang Temple a mess and stinking to the sky. Many precious offerings and Buddha statues in the temple were also robbed by the rebels.
    A few days later, I went to the Jokhang Temple again. The Jokhang Temple had completely changed at this time. The Tang willow in front of the temple had sprouted tender buds. In the quiet temple, the murmuring of the lamas chanting scriptures and the sound of hand bells ringing during the chanting were gently heard. The temple was cleaned spotlessly, the dust on the Buddha statues had been wiped away, and they were wiped to a golden shine. The pigeons raised in the temple walked on the smooth roof that had been wiped with ghee. The spring sunshine made the golden roof of the Jokhang Temple shine brilliantly.
    In Damba Village, a village on the west side of Lhasa, on the north side of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the farmers, with the assistance of the Lhasa Military Control Commission, began spring plowing. Before sowing, the farmers of Damba Village held a grand celebration ceremony. They lit auspicious pine smoke on the edge of the field, sprinkled "Qiangba" (sprinkled wine and tsampa flour), and tied auspicious red tassels on the horns of the plowing cattle.
    On every piece of land in the suburbs of Lhasa, you can see the smiling faces of farmers working happily and the "Wo, wo" shouts of driving cattle.
    The Potala Palace, washed by the spring rain, looked even more beautiful and moving in the morning light, and the streets of Lhasa were even more tidy. After the rebellion was quelled, the citizens of Lhasa raised the five-star red flag high on the roofs or in front of the doors to celebrate the new birth of Tibet. They had been reluctant to take it down for many days.
    The people of Lhasa are already living in the warm sunshine. (Attached picture)

    拉萨的新生
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师　李振羽
    往年拉萨的3月已经是春光明媚的好时光，可是今年却不一样。连日阴雪，加上一小撮西藏上层叛国分子给拉萨人民制造的灾难，使拉萨处于一种令人窒息的气氛中。
    叛乱分子威胁利诱西藏自治区筹委会的官员和藏族人民参加叛乱。而那些忠于祖国的官员们，那些深明大义的藏族人民却像躲避瘟神一样纷纷携家带口搬到靠近解放军部队的地方去住，或者干脆搬到机关或部队住的院里。部队官兵和干部们像接待亲人一样把前来避难的人安置在机关宿舍、办公楼、会议室里去住，当这些房子住满后他们又把自己的宿舍让给客人们，自己却搭起帐棚住在帐棚里。
    3月17日夜间，达赖喇嘛被叛匪劫出拉萨。3月19日夜间，叛匪向驻拉萨的中国人民解放军发起了全面进攻。我军不得不进行还击，一举消灭了这一小撮反动叛乱分子。拉萨上空的乌云很快就被东风吹散了，日光城中一片阳光。下面的几个片断是我当时的亲身经历，点滴见闻。
    在摄影机面前
    叛乱开始后，西藏上层反动分子中的母老虎们也摇头摆尾出现在街上。她们强迫一些妇女们去“开会”、“示威”。那些老实厚道的藏族妇女们真是有苦说不出，人被被强迫着去作自己明知道不对，而又非去作不可的事情时，她们内心的痛苦是可以想见的。
    在那些日子里我们常提着摄影机，冒着生命危险到街上去拍摄那些叛乱分子们闹事儿的素材。
    我在布达拉宫前面看到过一次叛乱分子举行的所谓“妇女大会”。成百的藏族劳动妇女被周围的武装叛匪包围着像囚犯一样坐在那里，有的哄着被吓哭了的孩子，有的哭丧着脸在想心事。这个大会，没有主席团，只见几个搽脂抹粉的贵族婆子在鬼鬼祟祟的商量一些什么。接着便是一个穿着华丽的贵族服装的长着一副粗野的面孔的中年妇女站起来，举着手像狗吠一样叫起来，看样子是领着妇女们喊口号，可是使她失望的是只有零星的几个贵族妇女在跟着她喊，藏族的劳动妇女们的嘴连动也没有动一下，甚至有的连头也没有抬一抬。
    接着，那些被迫着参加游行的妇女们在武装叛匪的挟持下踏着慢悠悠的步子走着。那些带头的母老虎们，当她们碰到摄影机的镜头对着她们时，不是背转脸去躲开，就是蒙着半个脸叫骂着从镜头前跑开。可见这些家伙也明知道自己干的是见不得人的勾当。
    3月22日我们跟随中国人民解放军的战士们一起到布达拉宫去。除了拍摄影片之外还兼作受降工作。在俘虏群中，一个满脸大麻子的叛匪被我们一眼发现了，立即从俘虏群里把他拉了出来。我问他：
  “木下，你还认识我吗？”这个叛匪楞了半天，嗫嗫嚅嚅地摇摇头说不认识。“不认识？哼！我的摄影机可认识你！”原来这个麻子叫习尼木下，在过去解放昌都的战役里，他是藏军的一个代本（团长）。这个家伙当时作了俘虏，我们曾拍过他投降的镜头。后来解放军本着宽大政策把他释放了。他不但不知悔改，反而以怨报德，又参加了这次叛乱。这个家伙虽然当俘虏有了经验，可是在电影摄影机镜头前面却是手足无措，不敢抬头。
  藏族人民坚决跟着共产党走
    3月15日，拉萨的机关干部和爱国进步的藏族官员组成了一个宣传队，冒着被叛匪袭击的危险，深入到街头巷尾向群众揭露叛乱分子的叛乱阴谋。在一条偏僻的街道上，很快就挤满了人。当宣传队员追述到共产党、中央人民政府为藏族人民作的好事时，有些妇女回忆起自己亲身经历过的事情，不禁激动得流下了眼泪。有一位三十多岁的妇女江央那木搂着一个四、五岁的小男孩对人说：“有良心的藏民都不会离开共产党。共产党、解放军做的好事数不清啊！我们母子两个人就是共产党毛主席救了我们的命。”原来四、五年前这个妇女是个在街头摆小摊、作小商贩的穷苦人。当她生这个孩子的时候遇到难产，幸得政府设立的医院挽救了她和儿子的生命。医生们连夜给产妇动手术，把自己的鲜血输给流血过多的产妇。
    宣传队出发的时候，有两个藏军士兵尾随在后面。宣传队开始进行宣传，这两个藏兵就在旁边捣乱。可是慢慢的他们听了两遍宣传后，其中有一个藏军士兵就偷偷溜走了；剩下的一个藏军士兵却成了宣传队里的义务纠察员，他不但不破坏宣传队的活动，反而帮助宣传队维持会场秩序。
    当宣传队员讲完话向群众说：同胞们！你们想一下你们是跟着谁走？是跟着反动派走受苦受难的死路，还是跟着共产党走光明、幸福的社会主义大道？激动了的人们高喊出一个声音：坚决跟着共产党走！那个被感化了的藏兵，也用手紧握着那支英国造的步枪，和群众喊出了同样的声音。
  军民亲如一家人
    平息叛乱后，拉萨市民都积极帮助人民解放军做着种种工作。有些叛匪逃跑前把枪支、弹药扔到厕所内和臭水沟里。叛乱平息了，很多群众发现武器后，立即报告解放军或自动把武器捞起来送到解放军驻地。
    在军管会工作队的一个驻地曾经发生这样一件事：队员们整日整夜忙着收缴武器，宣传党的政策，发放救济粮，脏衣服脱下来放到水盆里泡了几天也没有时间洗。有一天一个队员泡在盆里的衣服不知被谁给洗净晒干了，叠得整整齐齐。这个同志问别人谁帮他洗过衣服，大家都说不知道，打电话问他的爱人，他爱人根本就没有到他这儿来过。接着有些队员的衣服泡在盆里，也同样被洗净晒干了。后来他们发现原来是他们同院住的一位藏族老太太偷偷地帮他们洗了。当他们给老太太送洗衣费时，惹得老太太大发脾气。老太太说：“你们为我们日夜辛苦劳累，我给你们洗洗衣服，你们还来送钱，这是什么规矩？”同志们跟她解释说应该遵守群众纪律。老人家却吵着说：“我的纪律就是帮你们洗衣服，不准你们给钱。”
    新的生活开始了
    叛乱开始时，大昭寺是匪徒盘踞的重要据点之一。他们在大昭寺的屋顶上修起工事，把寺内的墙壁挖通作射击孔，向贸易公司、邮电局等地射击。如果不拔除这个叛匪盘踞的地方对我们的威胁相当大。在大昭寺内的匪徒知道人民解放军在战斗中也尽可能保护文物古迹的政策，他们抓住这一点，坚守着大昭寺。人民解放军在反击大昭寺内的匪徒时，一炮也没朝大昭寺打。为了消灭大昭寺内的匪徒，解放军战士勇猛地向匪徒们反击。3月22日上午，大昭寺终于解放了。我们随着人民解放军部队进入大昭寺时，看到到处是匪徒修筑的工事，到处是射击后的子弹壳，炮弹箱。叛匪们还在经堂里、佛像前到处拉屎撒尿，把大昭寺弄得一蹋糊涂，臭气冲天。寺里很多珍贵供器、佛像也都被叛匪抢走了。
    几天以后，我又到大昭寺去了。这时的大昭寺已经完全变了样。寺前的唐柳已经抽出了嫩芽。静穆的寺庙里喇嘛们诵经的喃喃声和诵经时摇动的手铃声轻轻地响着。寺院里打扫得干干净净，佛像上的尘土已被拂去，被擦得金光闪闪，寺内喂养的鸽子在用酥油擦拭过的光滑的屋顶上漫步，春日的阳光使大昭寺的金顶发出灿烂的光辉。
    拉萨西郊，青藏公路北侧的当巴村的农民在拉萨市军管会的协助下开始春耕了。播种之前，当巴村的农民举行了隆重的庆祝仪式。他们在田边燃起了吉祥如意的松烟，洒了“强粑”（洒酒和糌粑面），并且给耕牛角上扎上了表示吉利的红缨。
    在拉萨市郊的每块土地上，都可以看到农民们愉快劳动的笑脸和那“喔?，喔?”的赶牛的吆喝声。
    被春雨洗刷过的布达拉宫，在晨曦里显得更加美丽动人了，拉萨的街道也愈加整洁了。叛乱平息后，拉萨市民们把五星红旗高高地插到屋顶上或门前，来庆贺西藏的新生，多少天来他们一直舍不得摘下来。
    拉萨的人民已经生活在和煦的阳光里。（附图片）
