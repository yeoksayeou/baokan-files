Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch from New York: The "New York Times" in an editorial on the 1st urged India to quickly "move closer" to Pakistan and adopt a common anti-communist and anti-China stance.

The newspaper, using a blatant and provocative tone, wanted these two countries to "understand" from the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion "the common danger from the north." It believes that if this incident can prompt both sides to "fully realize" that the two countries have "a great common cause in their common security and survival," and become closer to discussing their differences, it would be "one of the most important by-products" of this incident.

The day before, the newspaper published a dispatch from New Delhi in a prominent position on the front page under the double-column headline "The Tibet Issue Stirs Calls for Reconciliation between India and Pakistan." The dispatch stated: "Responsible figures in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, and New Delhi are now openly talking about what they previously whispered cautiously." According to this dispatch, these "responsible figures" believe it is necessary to abandon the "hatred and suspicion" between the two countries in order to resist so-called "foreign aggression."

    美国“纽约时报”又出坏主意
    煽动印巴两国共同反华
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”1日在社论中催促印度赶快同巴基斯坦“靠拢”，采取共同的反共反华立场。
    这家报纸用露骨的挑拨性的口吻，要这两个国家从中国政府平定西藏叛乱的事件中“了解”到“来自北边的共同危险”。它认为，如果这次事件能促使双方“完全了解到”两国在它们的“共同安全和生存方面有着一个伟大的共同事业”，而更加接近于讨论它们之间的分歧那将是这次事件的“最重要的副产品之一”。
    在前一天，这家报纸在头版地位和在“西藏问题激起了印巴调和的要求”的双栏标题下刊载了一则来自新德里的消息。消息中谈到：“巴基斯坦首都卡拉奇和新德里的负责人物现在已经在公开谈论过去小心地耳语的东西”。据这条消息说，这些“负责人物”认为必须抛弃两国之间的“仇恨和猜疑”，以便抵御所谓“外来侵略”。
