Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th - The 16th Congress of the All India Kisan Sabha concluded on the 5th in Mayuram, Madras State. This four-day congress called on all Indian peasants and all units of the All India Kisan Sabha to launch a powerful nationwide movement to implement land reform in India.

The congress demanded a "thorough change in land relations to liberate peasants from the burden of debt and increasing taxes."

The All India Kisan Sabha is the only nationwide peasant organization in India, with approximately 1.5 million members. More than 300 representatives from all over the country attended the congress. After the congress closed, a grand parade was held with the participation of thousands of peasants and agricultural workers.

The resolution passed at the meeting expressed regret that the vast majority of state governments had not passed laws to stipulate the maximum amount of land ownership and had not prohibited the illegal transfer, division, and recovery of land. The resolution said that the Congress Party's Nagpur Resolution did not specifically mention the maximum limit of land and its distribution.

A. K. Gopalan, president of the All India Kisan Sabha, emphasized in his speech at the opening meeting that the basic demands of the All India Kisan Sabha are: to hand over ownership of land to all tenants, to fully guarantee that tenants are not deprived of the land they cultivate; to stipulate the maximum amount of land ownership, and to distribute the surplus land to tenants who have been deprived of land; to distribute all cultivable wasteland to agricultural workers and poor peasants; and that completing this task is a prerequisite for realizing cooperation in India. A. K. Gopalan, secretary of the Communist Party of India, was re-elected as president of the All India Kisan Sabha at this congress.

    全印农民协会开代表大会
    要求彻底改变土地关系
    新华社新德里7日电　全印农民协会第十六次代表大会5日在马德拉斯邦马尤兰闭幕。这次为期四天的大会号召全体印度农民和全印农民协会各单位开展一个强大的争取在印度贯彻土地改革的全国性运动。
    大会要求“彻底改变土地关系，把农民从负债和日益增加的赋税的重担中解放出来”。
    全印农民协会是印度唯一的全国性的农民组织，大约有一百五十万会员。出席大会的有来自全国各地的三百多名代表。大会闭幕后还举行了有几千名农民和农业工人参加的盛大游行。
    会议通过的决议对于绝大多数的邦政府没有通过法律来规定拥有土地的最高限额，没有禁止非法转移、分割和收回土地的法律表示遗憾。决议说，国大党的那格浦尔决议中根本没有具体提到土地的最高限额和分配问题。
    全印农民协会主席高普兰在开幕会议上讲话时曾经强调指出全印农民协会的基本要求是：把田产所有权交给所有的佃农，充分保证不剥夺佃农所耕种的土地；规定拥有土地的最高数额，把剩余的土地分给被剥夺土地的佃农；把所有可耕的荒地分给农业工人和贫农；完成这项任务是在印度实现合作化的先决条件。印度共产党书记处书记高普兰在这次大会上重新当选为全印农民协会主席。
