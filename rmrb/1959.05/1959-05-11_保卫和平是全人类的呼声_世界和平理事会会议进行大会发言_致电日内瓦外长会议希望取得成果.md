Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 9th - The World Peace Council Special Meeting held a general debate today.

    The first to speak at today's meeting was Japanese representative Ikuo Yasui. He talked about some principles of the peace movement and specifically pointed out that countries around the world have different attitudes towards the issues of peace and war, and the peace movement should support those countries that adopt peaceful policies. He agreed with Guo Moruo's analysis at the World Peace Conference last July regarding the war policies of the United States and the peace policies of socialist countries, and emphasized that Khrushchev's speech at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Zhou Enlai's recent report at the National People's Congress of China were both full of the spirit of peace. Therefore, they should be fully supported and understood by the broad masses.

    Yasui criticized the warmongers for inciting opposition to the Soviet Union and China, and introduced the growth of the Japanese peace movement in the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    The famous African-American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois warmly praised the achievements of the Soviet and Chinese peaceful construction at the meeting and sharply condemned the interventionist activities and war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. Du Bois said that the world is at a crossroads, with one path leading to reason and the other to war and suicide.

    Soviet representative Ehrenburg, in his speech, called on peace activists to strive to eliminate the danger of war in Europe. Ehrenburg said that the danger from West Germany is increasing. West Germany is being militarized, and the idea of revenge is spreading there. He emphasized that the people of all countries demand a struggle against the rearmament of West Germany, for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, and for the establishment of a region of complete disarmament. He also pointed out that the people of all countries must help the East-West summit meeting eliminate the Cold War, which everyone deeply abhors.

    Ms. Ingall of Britain introduced the situation of more than two thousand people in Britain marching against the production of nuclear weapons at the meeting. Her speech was warmly welcomed by the representatives.

    Representatives from Kenya, Senegal, Cyprus, Lebanon, and Argentina, based on their personal experiences, exposed the conspiracies of U.S., British, and French imperialism to conduct nuclear weapons tests, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and engage in expansion and divisive activities. They also spoke about the growing strength of the movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to fight for national independence and defend peace.

    Many representatives emphasized the urgent significance of the current struggle for a peaceful solution to the German question. They unanimously opposed the rearmament of West Germany and demanded that the Foreign Ministers' Conference produce satisfactory results.

    Representatives from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria described the contributions of their countries and peoples to the cause of peace over the past decade. Robert of the United States and Pritt of Britain also introduced to the representatives the struggles of the American and British people against the policies of their authorities and for peace.

    Representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World Federation of Democratic Youth also addressed the meeting today. They introduced the positions of these two organizations in the struggle to defend peace, and pointed out that the imperialist aggression not only destroys peace and threatens national independence, but also harms the interests of the working people and youth of their own countries.

    Today's meeting also unanimously adopted a telegram to the Geneva Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, expressing the hope that the meeting would express the hopes of mankind and achieve effective results. The telegram expressed the hope that the meeting would pave the way for a summit meeting, eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons, and lead the world out of the Cold War towards peaceful coexistence and international cooperation.

    The meeting adjourned in the afternoon after reading congratulatory telegrams from Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and others.

    Another dispatch: Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, sent congratulatory telegrams to the special meeting of the World Peace Council on the 5th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 9th - The Mongolian "Unen" published on the 9th an appeal from the Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace to the people of the world in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the peace movement.

    The appeal stated that while expressing the peaceful aspirations of the Mongolian people, the Mongolian Committee for the Defense of Peace calls on all upright people to fight for a peaceful solution to international issues, especially the German question, and for the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Europe and Asia.
