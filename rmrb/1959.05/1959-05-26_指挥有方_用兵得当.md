Skillful Command, Proper Use of Troops
            Jiang Weicai

    The summer harvest and summer planting season is the most intense period of the entire year's agricultural production, and it is also the decisive battle of the entire year's agricultural production. In order to win a complete victory in this battle, various regions have now generally concentrated about 90% of their labor force on the front line. After the forces are concentrated, leading cadres at all levels, especially the cadres of production teams, must also be good at commanding and using these forces to maximize the role of each person.

    Good command and proper use, even with insufficient labor, can win battles; poor command and improper use, even with more labor, may delay the farming season. "Many soldiers and capable generals" is certainly a condition for victory, but if the command is weak and the use of troops is improper, it will also lead to failure. During the Battle of Red Cliffs in the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu had good strategies and skillful command. Although their troops were small, they defeated Cao Cao's 800,000 strong army. Cadres on the agricultural production front should also be like commanders in the army, good at using strategies, good at commanding, and good at using troops.

    The cadres of the production teams of the Sanmao Commune, based on the characteristics of the busy summer harvest and summer planting, adopted the method of posting farm work assignments and "knowing farm work and work points early," orderly using each labor force in the most appropriate place, making the progress of summer harvest and summer planting both fast and of good quality. This is an example of skillful command and proper use of troops. This approach is especially worth promoting in the current tense season of summer harvest and summer planting.

    During the busy period of summer harvest and summer planting, how to achieve busyness without chaos, and to carry out various farm work in an orderly manner, is one of the most important keys to completing summer harvest and summer planting in a timely manner. Summer production is very busy, requiring both rushing to harvest and rushing to plant, as well as strengthening field management of spring-sown crops. Some farm work even needs to be carried out simultaneously. With so much farm work and such tight seasons and labor, what should be done? This requires the people's communes, especially the production teams of the contracted units, to have a strict operation plan. The experience of the Sanmao Commune tells us that in addition to formulating a large plan for summer harvest and summer planting, the production team must also, according to the importance and urgency of farm work, the strength of labor, and the level of technology, formulate small-segment operation plans for several days based on the person, time, place, and farm work, and submit this plan to the commune members for discussion, on the one hand, to fully absorb the rational opinions of the masses, and on the other hand, to make each commune member know in advance the combat tasks for each day and several days; to know their battle direction and battle objectives. Doing so can not only further mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members, but also make everyone busy and happy, busy without chaos. This is precisely the working method of the mass line that combines leadership and the masses. Completing each small-segment operation plan provides a reliable guarantee for completing the large plan of summer harvest and summer planting.

    The practice of posting farm work assignments and "knowing farm work and work points three days in advance" also embodies the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, which is more conducive to encouraging the labor enthusiasm of commune members. Commune members know in advance what kind of work to do, what kind of labor quota, and how much labor work point remuneration they can get. When they are working, they are more motivated, and can more proactively and actively complete the labor quota, and strive to exceed it.

    指挥有方  用兵得当
            姜韦才
    夏收夏种是全年农业生产上最紧张的季节，也是全年农业生产的决定性的战役。为了取得这一战役的全胜，现在各地一般都集中了90％左右的劳力开上了第一线。在力量集中起来以后，各级领导干部，尤其是生产队的干部，还必须善于指挥和使用这些力量，使每个人发挥最大的作用。
    指挥得好，使用得当，即便劳力不足，也能打胜仗；指挥得不好，使用不当，即便劳力多，也可能延误农时。“兵多将广”固然是取胜的条件，但是，如果指挥不力，用兵不当，也会失利。三国时的赤壁之战，诸葛亮、周瑜的计谋好，指挥有方，虽然兵力小，却打败了曹操八十万雄师。农业生产战线上的干部，也应当像军队里的指挥员一样，要善于用计，善于指挥，善于用兵。
    三茅公社各生产队的干部，根据夏收夏种大忙的特点，采用农活挂牌，“农活、工分早知道”的办法，有条不紊地把每个劳力都用在最恰当的地方，夏收夏种的进度既快，质量又好。这就是指挥有方、用兵得当的一例。这种做法，在当前夏收夏种的紧张季节，尤其值得提倡。
    在夏收夏种大忙期间，如何做到忙而不乱，各种农活做得井井有条，是及时完成夏收夏种的重要关键之一。夏季生产是很忙的，既要抢收，又要抢种，还要加强春播作物的田间管理，有些农活还要在同一个时间内交叉进行。农活这么多，季节、劳力这么紧，该怎么办？这就要求人民公社，尤其是包产单位的生产队，有严密的作战计划。三茅公社的经验告诉我们，生产队除制订夏收夏种的大计划以外，还必须根据农活的轻重缓急、劳力强弱、技术水平等情况，因人、因时、因地、因农活订出几天的小段作战计划，并把这个计划交给社员讨论，一方面充分吸取群众的合理意见，一方面使每个社员都事先知道每天和几天内的作战任务；知道自己的战斗方向和战斗目标。这样做，既能进一步调动社员的积极性，又能使大家又忙又高兴，忙而不乱。这正是领导与群众相结合的群众路线的工作方法。完成了每个小段作战计划，就为完成夏收夏种的大计划提供了可靠的保证。
    农活挂牌，“农活、工分三天早知道”的做法，还体现了按劳分配、多劳多得的原则，它更有助于鼓励社员的劳动积极性，社员们事先知道干什么样的活、什么样的劳动定额、能有多少劳动工分报酬，他们在干活的时候就更有“奔头”，就能更加主动地积极地完成劳动定额，力争超额。
