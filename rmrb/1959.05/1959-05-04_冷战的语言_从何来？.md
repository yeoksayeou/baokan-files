Where Does the "Language of the Cold War" Come From?

　　"Panchsheel" is weeping! Ominous clouds hang over her birthplace—the Himalayas. On the other side of the mountains, in one of the countries that initiated "Panchsheel," some despicable and ulterior-minded people have used shameless slander and vicious lies to continuously and concertedly attack China, which has always advocated peaceful coexistence. They are baring their teeth and claws at the door of a friend, replacing mutual respect and care with curses and intimidation. "Panchsheel" has been deeply trampled upon!

　　However, when vicious words of slander, abuse, and distortion of the truth rain down on our heads, when "Panchsheel" is damaged due to one party's distortion, in the Indian Lok Sabha, according to Prime Minister Nehru, this is merely a "natural reaction," "not political in essence," and may even be "moderate and precise language." Yet, when the Chinese people rise up to counterattack the interferers in order to defend their sovereignty and maintain the purity of "Panchsheel," they are considered to have "disregarded facts and etiquette, and used the language of the Cold War!" It is "particularly distressing" that: "This situation is happening in a great country with thousands of years of cultural tradition, known for its measured behavior and politeness." This is simply a gross distortion. In Prime Minister Nehru's own words: This is truly a "completely unfounded accusation."

　　Who is it that "disregards facts and etiquette and uses the language of the Cold War"?

　　Take a look at the Indian newspapers in recent months! As early as February 24th, before the Tibetan rebellion broke out, the Indian Post, like a fabulist, clamored that Tibet's "nationalism has risen up against China," and even said that "India must deal with a ruthless and ambitious imperialism." Five days before the rebellion, The Indian Statesman shouted that Lhasa was about to launch a "full-scale revolution" and reported in detail that the rebels were meticulously deploying and preparing weapons. Is all of this "regarding facts and politeness"? Isn't this excessive "enthusiasm" and incitement precisely the language of the "Cold War"? Irrefutable evidence shows that you have already started the "Cold War."

　　When the Tibetan rebellion, which split the motherland and betrayed the nation, was quickly put down, all of China's friends were happy for China and for the Tibetan people. But some people in India became anxious and enraged. They began to hurl abuse. Acharya Kripalani, General Secretary of the Indian National Congress, said: "The Congress will not hesitate to declare to the world China's atrocities in Tibet." Jaya Prakash Narayan, leader of the Indian "Sarvodaya Movement," attacked China for "invading" its own territory of Tibet. Mr. Na. Ga. Goray, General Secretary and Member of Parliament of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, cursed China's suppression of the rebellion in its own territory as "a new and vicious imperialism" and called on Indians to "beware of China's expansionist imperialism."... "Atrocities," "aggression," "vicious imperialism," "expansionist imperialism," all kinds of fierce words, like a barrage of bullets, were fired out. Is this a beautiful ode to "Panchsheel"? Who exactly is making "rude accusations" and using the "language of the Cold War"?

　　But Prime Minister Nehru, disregarding all the facts, even said that "we have fortunately kept ourselves out of the Cold War," and that there are merely "occasional lapses in restraint"!

　　We will no longer quote the nonsense in the newspapers. But, in addition to this, many events can be cited that are not "occasional." The so-called "demonstrations" protesting China's "aggression" against Tibet have taken place more than once in India, and have even developed into crude insults against the images of Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people. Is this also called "not political" and "occasional lapses in restraint"? The Indian police who were present at the time not only did not intervene, but also deliberately pushed the crowd aside to allow people to take pictures. Is this also an "occasional lapse in restraint"? Why didn't they "occasionally lose restraint" and knock down a few people with batons? According to Prime Minister Nehru, this impolite act of violence was merely done by a few irresponsible people. Then, the officials of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs should be "responsible people," right? Why are they so enthusiastic about distributing the so-called Dalai Lama's statements that slander a friendly country, and not "occasionally lose restraint" and distribute the comments of political reporters from the Xinhua News Agency? The president of the Congress Party is also a "responsible person," why does he repeatedly meet with representatives of the Tibetan rebels, and publicly call Tibet, which is part of China's territory, a "country," and why doesn't he "occasionally lose restraint" and call India's twenty-eight states twenty-eight countries?

　　Based on genuine facts and etiquette, we cannot but point out that it is those ambitious and ulterior-minded elements in India who have used a large amount of "Cold War language" against China, and that there is "a tendency to use unrestrained language and often make unwarranted and violent accusations."

　　At this time when Sino-Indian friendly relations have been severely damaged, we must shout loudly to the ambitious gentlemen of India: Quickly stop the "language of the Cold War"! He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off. We believe that as long as you are a little more honest, this cloud will naturally disappear. "Panchsheel" will also smile, and continue to soar gracefully over the land of peace and friendship between the great China and India.

### “冷战的语言”从何来？

    “冷战的语言”从何来？
    “潘查希拉”在哭泣！不祥的乌云，笼罩在她的诞生地——喜马拉雅山的上空。在高山的那边，一个“潘查希拉”发起者之一的国家里，有一些卑鄙的别有用心的人，用了无耻的谩骂和恶毒的谎言连续地集中地攻击一向和平共处的中国。他们在朋友的大门口张牙舞爪，用咒骂和恫吓代替相互尊重和关怀。“潘查希拉”深深地被践踏了！
    但是，当污蔑谩骂歪曲真理的恶毒言辞如倾盆大雨浇到我们头上来的时候，当“潘查希拉”由于一方的歪曲遭到损害的时候，在印度的人民院里，根据尼赫鲁总理的说法，这只不过是“本能的反应”，“实质上也不是政治性的”，甚至可能是“温和确切的语言”。而中国人民为了保卫自己的主权，为了维护“潘查希拉”的纯洁而奋起反击干涉者，却被认为是“不顾事实和礼节，使用了冷战的语言！”“尤其令人难过”的是：“这种情况发生在一个有着数千年文化传统、以行为有度和彬彬有礼著称的伟大国家。”这简直是天大的歪曲。用尼赫鲁总理自己的话来说：这才真正是“完全没有根据的指责”。
    究竟是谁“不顾事实和礼节，使用了冷战的语言”呢？
    翻翻最近几个月来印度的报纸吧！早在西藏叛乱爆发之前，2月24日的印度邮报，就像寓言家一样大吵大闹地说什么西藏的“民族主义已起而反叛中国”了，还说什么“印度不得不同一个残酷无情和野心勃勃的帝国主义打交道”。叛乱发生前五天，印度政治家报又大呼拉萨要发动“全面革命”，而且详细报道叛军正缜密部署和准备武器。这一切，难道是“顾事实和礼貌”的吗？这种过分的“热心”和煽动，难道不正是“冷战”的言语吗？铁证难辩，你们早就已经开始了“冷战”。
    当分裂祖国、背叛民族的西藏叛乱被很快地平服下去了的时候，所有中国的朋友都为中国高兴，为西藏人民高兴。但是印度的一些人士却焦躁暴跳起来了。他们开始破口大骂。印度国大党秘书长克里帕拉尼说：“国大党将毫不犹豫地向世界宣布中国在西藏的暴行”。印度“共同繁荣运动”领袖贾雅·普拉卡希·纳拉扬攻击中国
  “侵略”了自己的领土西藏。印度人民社会党总书记、议员纳·格·戈拉伊先生谩骂中国平定自己地方的叛乱是“一种新的和凶恶的帝国主义”，要印度人“小心提防中国的扩张帝国主义”。……“暴行”、“侵略”、“凶恶的帝国主义”、“扩张帝国主义”，一切凶恶的字眼，像连珠炮一样射了出来。难道这是对“潘查希拉”的美妙颂歌吗？究竟是谁在对谁进行“粗暴的指责”和“冷战的语言”呢？
    可是尼赫鲁总理不顾一切事实，还说什么“我们幸而一直置身于冷战之外”，只不过是“偶尔也有失去节制的时候”！
    报纸上的胡言乱语我们不再去引证它了。但是，除此之外，还可以举出很多并非“偶尔”的事件。所谓抗议中国“侵略”西藏的“示威游行”，在印度已经不止一次了，并且一直发展到对中国人民的领袖毛主席的画像进行粗野的侮辱，这也叫“不是政治性的”“偶尔失去节制”吗？当时在场的印度警察，不仅不加干涉，还有意推开人群让人去照相，这也是“偶尔失去节制”吗？他们为什么不“偶尔失去节制”，用警棒打倒几个人呢？据尼赫鲁总理说，这种不礼貌的暴行只不过是少数不负责任的人干的。那末，印度的外交部官员总该是“负责任的人”了吧，为什么他们又那么热心于散发诽谤友邦的所谓达赖声明，而不“偶尔失去节制”，散发新华社政治记者的评论呢？国大党的主席也是“负责任的人”了，为什么一次又一次接见西藏叛乱分子的代表，还公然把属于中国领土一部分的西藏叫做“国家”（country），为什么又不“偶尔失去节制”把印度的二十八个邦说成二十八个国家呢？
    根据真正的事实和礼貌，我们不能不指出：正是印度的那些野心家和别有用心的分子向中国使用了大量的“冷战的语言”，“有一种使用放纵的语言和常常提出毫无道理的狂暴的指责的倾向”。
    在这中印友好关系受到严重破坏的时候，我们的确要向印度的野心家先生们大叫一声：快快停止“冷战语言”吧！解铃还需系铃人，我们相信，只要你们放老实一点，这一片乌云就会自然消失。“潘查希拉”也会笑逐颜开，依旧翩翩翱翔于伟大的中印两国和平友好的土地上。
