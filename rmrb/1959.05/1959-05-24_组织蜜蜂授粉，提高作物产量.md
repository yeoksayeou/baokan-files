    Organize Bee Pollination to Increase Crop Yield
    Gong Yifei, Lecturer at Fujian Agricultural College
    The economic value of bees in producing honey and wax is well-known, but the even more important benefit of beekeeping – promoting pollination and increasing the yield of oil crops, grains, fruits, and vegetables – has not yet received the attention it deserves from all parties.
    There are many examples of how bee pollination increases crop yields, and some are listed below:
    I. Oil Crops: (1) Rapeseed is an important oil crop in the Yangtze River basin and southern provinces of China. Experiments have shown that rapeseed relies on insects for cross-pollination. Rapeseed that has been fully pollinated by bees produces 54.7% to 307.1% more seeds than rapeseed that is isolated from bees with mesh cages. Moreover, the oil content of the seeds and the vitality of the offspring are significantly improved. In 1958,垛田乡 in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, cultivated 10,345 mu of rapeseed, with an average of one bee colony for every 12.6 mu. As a result, the average yield of rapeseed in the township was 270.5 jin per mu, which was significantly higher than in neighboring townships without beekeeping, and 3.7 times higher than the national average yield that year. In addition, the Bureau of Economic Crops of the Ministry of Agriculture investigated several high-yielding rapeseed counties, such as Nanhui County in Shanghai, Zhong County in Sichuan, Nanzheng County in Shaanxi, Cixi County in Zhejiang, and Songzi County in Hubei, and these counties happened to be key beekeeping counties. The above examples fully demonstrate that organizing bee pollination is an important measure to ensure increased rapeseed production.
    (2) Sunflower is also an important oil crop. Artificial pollination is often used in various places. However, eight artificial pollinations do not work as well as bee pollination. Experiments have shown that allocating one bee colony for every 15 mu of sunflowers can increase yield by 25% to 30%.
    II. Fruit Trees: (1) Lychee is a fruit tree that relies on insects for cross-pollination. The Xianfeng Fruit Farmers' Cooperative in Jiuhu Township, Longxi County, Fujian Province, had 3,245 mu of lychee trees. In 1958, the cooperative strengthened orchard management and coordinated 6,500 bee colonies for honey collection and pollination activities, producing more than 4.05 million jin of fruit, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest.
    (2) Citrus – After Wenzhou tangerines are pollinated by bees, the yield increases by 6.3%, and the average weight of the fruit and the proportion of pulp are improved. The summary of the high-yield garden of Xuegan in Liufengzhou, Fuzhou City, Fujian Province (more than 40,000 jin per mu) also affirmed the role of bee pollination.
    Bee pollination also has a significant yield-increasing effect on apples, apricots, peaches, pears, plums, persimmons, and other fruit trees.
    III. Vegetables: (1) Cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, cauliflower, and radish are self-incompatible. Cabbage flowers will not bear fruit if insects are not allowed to pollinate them. Bee pollination of cauliflower increases seed yield fourfold compared to caging to isolate bees. It also has a significant impact on the yield of radish seeds.
    (2) Cucurbits are all dioecious. In areas with a large cultivation of cucumbers but lacking bees, the yield is only 2.5 dan per mu, while in cucumber gardens near beehives within thirty zhang, the yield reaches 23 dan per mu. The Soviet Union's use of bees for pollination of cucumbers in greenhouses has achieved even greater results, not only saving labor but also increasing yield by more than double.
    IV. Cotton: A strong bee colony can collect 800 to 2,000 kilograms of honey from cotton in a single day, while also bringing many benefits to cotton, such as reducing cotton boll shedding, increasing cotton boll weight, and improving the vitality of offspring plants.
    V. Buckwheat: Placing bee colonies near buckwheat fields can significantly increase the harvest and collect a large amount of honey. In many areas of northern China, each bee colony can collect 30 to 50 jin of honey during the autumn buckwheat flowering season. Soviet experiments have shown that bee pollination can increase the yield of buckwheat by 500 to 600 kilograms per hectare. At present, only a minority of people's communes and state-owned farms across the country have apiaries. The beekeeping industry, which has dual benefits, should be rapidly developed to fully utilize bees to contribute to the increased production of agriculture and sideline occupations this year.

    组织蜜蜂授粉，提高作物产量
    福建农学院讲师　龚一飞
    蜜蜂生产蜜和蜡的经济价值很高，这是大家都知道的，但是养蜂另一方面更重要的好处——促进油料、粮食和果蔬等农作物的授粉增产，却还没有引起各方面应有的重视。
    蜜蜂授粉对农作物增产的事例是很丰富的，现分别举出一些来说明：
    一、油料作物方面：（1）油菜是我国长江流域及南方各省的重要油料作物。根据试验证明，油菜是虫媒异花授粉的。经过蜜蜂充分授粉的油菜比套纱笼隔绝蜜蜂授粉的种籽产量要提高54.7％—307.1％，而且种籽含油量和后代的生活力都有显著的提高。1958年江苏省兴化县垛田乡栽培的油菜一万零三百四十五亩，平均每十二点六亩配置蜜蜂一群，结果全乡油菜籽平均亩产二百七十点五斤，比邻乡没有放蜂的显著增产，比当年全国平均亩产量提高三点七倍。此外农业部经济作物局调查了几省油菜丰产县如：上海市南汇县、四川忠县、陕西南郑县、浙江慈溪县、湖北松滋县，这些县恰恰又都是养蜂重点县。以上事例充分说明组织蜜蜂授粉是保证油菜增产的一种重要措施。
    （2）向日葵也是一种重要的油料作物。各地常用人工辅助授粉。试用人工授粉八次的效果还不如蜜蜂授粉的来得好。试验证明每十五亩向日葵配蜂一群，就可使产量提高25％—30％。
    二、果树方面：（1）荔枝是虫媒异花授粉的果树。福建省龙溪县九湖乡先锋果农社有荔枝三千二百四十五亩，1958年由于该社加强果园管理工作，并配合六千五百群蜜蜂进行采蜜授粉活动，产果四百零五万多斤，获得了空前的大丰收。
    （2）柑桔——温州蜜柑经蜜蜂授粉后，产量增加6.3％，果实的平均重量和果肉的比重都有提高。福建省福州市郊六凤洲雪柑高产园（亩产四万多斤）的总结中也肯定了蜜蜂授粉的作用。
    蜜蜂授粉对苹果、杏、桃、梨、梅、柿以及其他果树也有显著增产作用。
    三、蔬菜方面：（1）十字花科蔬菜如甘蓝、花椰菜、萝卜等都属于自花不孕的。甘蓝花不让昆虫授粉是不结实的。蜜蜂给花椰菜授粉，比套笼隔绝蜜蜂的种子产量增加四倍。同样对萝卜种子的产量也有显著的影响。
    （2）瓜类都是雌雄异花的。大量栽培胡瓜的地方，缺少蜜蜂地区，每亩只产二担半，而在蜂场三十丈附近的胡瓜园每亩产量竟达到二十三担。苏联利用蜜蜂进行温室内黄瓜的授粉，更收到巨大的效果，不但节省人工，同时提高产量一倍以上。
    四、棉花方面：一个强盛蜂群一天内可以从棉花上采集八百至二千克的蜜，同时给棉花带来许多好处，如棉铃脱落现象减少；棉桃重量增加；后代植株生活力也因而提高。
    五、荞麦方面：把蜂群放在荞麦田附近，能够显著地提高收获量，同时采到大量蜂蜜。我国北方许多地区在秋季荞麦花期，每群可收三十——五十斤蜜。苏联实验证明，蜜蜂授粉能使每公顷荞麦多打五百——六百公斤种子。目前全国各地人民公社和国营农场中设有蜂场的还是少数。具有双重利益的养蜂事业应当迅速的开展起来，充分利用蜜蜂为今年的农副业增产出把力。
