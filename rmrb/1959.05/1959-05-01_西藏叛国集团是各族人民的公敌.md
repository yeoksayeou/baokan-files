Joint Statement by Commissioner Songmou and Representative Gengjue

    We fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by the two Vice Premiers Li on the National Economic Plan and the State Budget.

    We are Tibetan Living Buddhas from Guihua Temple in Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. We warmly support all the policies and measures taken by the State Council concerning the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet.

    The crimes of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique in colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland are heinous. Recently, the so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" released by Indian diplomatic officials in order to deceive and hoodwink the public has aroused even greater resentment. It was concocted under the manipulation and direction of foreigners and does not represent the Dalai Lama's true intentions. This fact is becoming increasingly clear, and even Indian officials can no longer deny it.

    The activities of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique to split the unification of the motherland have long been carried out under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries. On the eve of liberation, they conspired to obstruct the peaceful liberation of Tibet. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they did their utmost to undermine the implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. As we understand it, on the eve of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they carried out many conspiracies. They fabricated the "Nongdan" (divine prophecy) of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, disseminating it everywhere, saying: "The Communists are coming to destroy religion," "Red Russia is an enemy of religion." The "Nongdan" openly put forward the reactionary slogan of "unity of monks and laity to jointly oppose the Communist Party," attempting to resist liberation and undermine the unification of the motherland. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they concentrated their efforts on opposing the implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. In addition to using the Tibetan local government as a center for reactionary activities, they also organized a reactionary organization called "Baimeng Meng" to carry out reactionary activities in various places. The fundamental proposition of this reactionary organization was: to split the unification of the motherland, to engage in the so-called "Tibetan independence" and "Tibetan people's independence" plotted by imperialism and foreign reactionaries. They not only wanted to split Tibet from the big family of the motherland, but also ambitiously wanted to place the Tibetan areas of Xikang and Yunnan under their jurisdiction, and split them away together. When the Central Government established the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1956 in accordance with the policy of national regional autonomy in the Constitution and the requirements of the Tibetan people, they rose up to oppose the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, opposed progressive people and the masses from participating in political activities, spread rumors, incited upper-class elements to oppose national regional autonomy, consolidated the former Tibetan local government controlled by their reactionary elements, confronted the Central Government, accumulated strength, and realized the so-called "Tibetan independence" to break away from the motherland, waiting for an opportunity to carry out a full-scale rebellion. As early as 1955, they created some sporadic bandit activities around Tibet to consolidate their reactionary center.

    The rebellions in the Khampa area and parts of our Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan in 1955 were planned and organized by the Tibetan reactionary clique. In 1955, reactionary elements Chijiang · Luosang Yixi returned to Tibet from Beijing, intentionally passing through Changdu and Xiangcheng, and carried out a series of reactionary activities in these areas. He convened meetings of temple and chieftain representatives, planned the rebellion in its entirety, determined to launch armed forces on the spot, established a system for organizing and commanding, planned the source of weapons and provisions, stipulated the date of the rebellion, and put forward reactionary slogans such as "Tibetan unity, drive out the Han people" and "unity of monks and laity, drive out the Han and achieve independence." After Chijiang · Luosang Yixi returned to Lhasa, he personally issued the order to launch the rebellion. After the rebellion broke out, the reactionary clique provided support in many ways, transporting ammunition to the bandits from Chaou and Bishi Haodi, issuing "amulet spells," "chanting scriptures for the salvation" of the bandits killed in Lhasa, and repeatedly shouting to persevere and not surrender. However, contrary to the expectations of the reactionary clique, the Tibetan people did not support them, and the bandit rebellion was quickly quelled. In order to cover up their conspiracy to betray the motherland, the reactionary elements spread the slander that the rebellion in the Khampa area was caused by the failure to implement policies during the reform, which obviously cannot deceive anyone. We know that the Central Government and local governments have consistently adhered to the method of peaceful consultation in the reform of Tibetan areas, but because the upper-class reactionary elements refused to accept the method of peaceful reform, and took up arms to oppose the reform and carry out rebellion, only under such circumstances did the People's Liberation Army rise up to quell the rebellion. Is it not right to do so? The reactionary elements always dress themselves up as protectors of national interests. They clamor that "the rebellion is to resist national oppression" and "to prevent the nation from being eliminated," and falsely accuse the liberation of Tibet of "adding a rope to the Tibetan people." Everyone knows that the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique long carried out cruel and barbarous rule and oppression of the farmers and herdsmen, turning Tibet into a living hell. Everyone also knows that in the few years since the liberation of Tibet, the Party and the Central Government have brought countless benefits to the Tibetan people. Taking our Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan as an example, in just a few years, it has achieved brilliant achievements that could not be achieved in thousands of years. Agricultural production has developed significantly, and the yield per mu of grain has increased from more than 100 jin to more than 250 jin, and the total output has increased from more than 30 million jin to more than 70 million jin. On the plateau, which has never had industry, there are now mechanical factories, farm tool factories, power stations, wool spinning, leather and other factories. The development of other cultural, educational, health and transportation sectors has also been very rapid. People's lives have also improved and improved significantly. In the past, most people could not afford to eat butter, salt and tea, and many people's linen clothes were very tattered. Now most people have salt, tea and butter, wear cotton clothes, and have escaped from thousands of years of poverty. This situation fully shows that only the Communist Party is the savior who unlocks the ropes on the Tibetan people. If it were not for the Communist Party leading the people of all ethnic groups in the state to carry out land reform and embark on the socialist road, it would be impossible for the Tibetan people to live a happy life. Furthermore, as far as the situation in the Tibetan region is concerned, although the reactionaries have hindered the reform of the social system and the development of production, there have still been great changes and developments compared with the past. As for those reactionaries who claim to be for "national interests," what have they given to the Tibetan people? Besides exploiting, oppressing and deceiving the people, there is nothing else. The Tibetan reactionary clique said in its instructions to the rebel elements: "Killing a national activist is equivalent to chanting the mantra of heaven one hundred million times; killing a national cadre is equivalent to chanting the mantra of heaven two hundred million times." Under their instructions, the rebel elements massacred a large number of people and cadres of their own ethnicity, and used all cruel means. Some were gouged out of their eyes, some had their ears and noses cut off, some were disemboweled and their hearts and livers dug out, and some were burned alive. Are these inhumane acts the "national interests" of the Tibetan people? This small group of reactionary ruling class is destroying and destroying its own nation, and trapping the Tibetan people in a living hell forever.

    The reactionary clique also pretends to be a "protector of religion" to deceive. They say that "many lamas have been killed, monks have been arrested to build roads, and armed forces have destroyed many temples," "interference with the exercise of the right to religious freedom has increased," etc., to provoke the relationship between believers and the Party and the government's army, so that they can use the masses to carry out acts of betrayal. Everyone knows that the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief and the policy of respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities are not only solemnly stipulated in the Common Program and the Constitution, but have also been consistently implemented. Taking the facts in our Diqing area as an example, religion has been protected by the government for several years. Many Living Buddhas and Lamas have obtained political arrangements and living subsidies, and legitimate religious activities have been respected and protected. On the contrary, some religious temples have been used by reactionaries as centers for rebellious activities, and some Living Buddhas and Lamas have engaged in counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of religion. These people have been sanctioned by national laws, which is completely deserved. Legitimate religious activities, national customs and habits in the Lhasa area have been fully protected and respected by the government, which is also obvious to all. The reactionaries who call for "fighting to protect religion" are obviously ulterior motives. Buddhism is based on compassion and universal salvation, and killing is the main precept of religion. However, the rebel elements specialize in killing, arson, looting, and rape, and even destroy Buddhist halls and loot temple property. The facts show that it is not others who are destroying religion, but precisely these reactionary elements who pretend to be pious and say that they hope people will ascend to heaven together. In order to truly protect freedom of religious belief and maintain the dignity of religion, we must resolutely denounce these reactionary elements in cassocks.

    All the slanders and rumors of the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet and imperialism and foreign reactionaries cannot deceive people. Their purpose is nothing more than to split the unification of the motherland and find an excuse to turn Tibet into a colony or protectorate of foreign countries. Tibet is an inseparable part of China, and the Tibetan people and the Han people have long formed an inseparable relationship of flesh and blood. Whoever wants to split the unification of the motherland, whoever wants to split the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, he is not only the enemy of the Tibetan people, but also the common enemy of all ethnic groups in the country. Everyone must rise up and condemn them. Our suppression of the rebellion in Tibet is a matter for the Chinese people themselves and does not allow anyone to interfere. The expansionists in India have openly interfered in our country's internal affairs, and even openly clamored that India should declare "Tibetan independence" and that India should inherit the British imperialist "monopoly rights" over Tibet. In addition to viciously attacking our country, they even insulted Chairman Mao, the great leader beloved by the people of all ethnic groups. It is really arrogant to the extreme, and it is tolerable, but what is intolerable! These expansionist elements regard our country's tolerance out of love for the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people as weakness and deception. These people have underestimated the situation and their heads have become dizzy. They have forgotten that the era when imperialism was rampant in the world has passed. The Chinese people are already masters standing proudly on their own land, and the era of being slaughtered by others has gone forever. We are willing to consolidate the friendship between us and the neighboring country of India. If someone mistakenly thinks that we can be deceived and wants to inherit the mantle of British imperialism, or take this opportunity to gain something, then it is simply wishful thinking. Whoever wants to reach into our Tibet, then we will no longer be polite, we will definitely chop off his devil's hand and let him learn a lesson. Tibetan reactionary traitorous clique, you have committed heinous crimes against the motherland, and your crimes are unforgivable. If you still cling to your delusions and want to continue to rely on foreign reactionary forces, sell your motherland and your nation, and continue to be enemies with the motherland to the end, then you will eventually not escape the severe punishment of the people. Now that your rebellion has been crushed, if you can repent early and plead guilty to the people of the motherland, the motherland will still leave a door of leniency for you, you can choose wisely. We also hope that the Dalai Lama will get rid of the coercion of the reactionary elements and return to the embrace of the motherland.

    In order to safeguard the sacred unity of the motherland and safeguard the interests of the Tibetan people, the people of all strata of the Tibetan region, both monks and laity, must unite closely under the leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely support and assist the government and the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly suppressing the rebellion, resolutely crush the conspiracies of imperialism and foreign reactionaries to provoke and split the unification of the motherland, and oppose any form of splitting national unity and the unification of the motherland. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and without the big family of the motherland, it is impossible for our ethnic minorities to have any future except to be reduced to colonies of imperialism. At the same time, we urgently hope that on the basis of quelling the rebellion and stabilizing social order, under the leadership of the Party and the state, we will realize national regional autonomy in the Tibetan region as soon as possible. In accordance with the spirit of the Constitution and the specific conditions of Tibet, actively prepare the conditions and quickly determine the time for democratic reform, so as to realize the land reform that the broad masses of the Tibetan people have long yearned for as soon as possible, and liberate the productive forces from the serf system. The common experience of all ethnic minorities proves that it is fundamentally impossible for any nation to transition to socialism without democratic reform. Now that the Tibetan reactionary clique has been completely defeated, the Tibetan people's desire to implement social democratic reform can certainly be realized. We are willing to see that in the near future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, the Tibetan people will surely embark on the bright road of socialism and gradually build the Tibetan plateau into a true paradise on earth.

    西藏叛国集团是各族人民的公敌
    松谋委员　更觉代表的联合发言
    我们完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，和两位李副总理关于国民经济计划和国家预决算的报告。
    我们是云南省迪庆藏族自治州归化寺的藏族活佛，我们热烈拥护国务院有关平息西藏叛乱的一切政策和措施。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和国外反动派背叛祖国的罪恶是十恶不赦的。最近他们为了欺骗和蒙蔽视听，由印度外交官员发布的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，看了更使人愤恨。它是在外国人的操纵和指使下搞的，不是出自达赖喇嘛的本意。这个事实，现在是愈来愈更清楚了，连印度的官员也再难以否认了。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团分裂祖国统一的活动，是长期以来就在帝国主义和外国反动派主使下进行的，解放前夕，他们就阴谋阻挠和平解放西藏。西藏和平解放后，又全力破坏和平解放西藏办法十七条协议的实施。据我们了解，在和平解放西藏的前夕，他们就进行了许多阴谋活动，他们假造了十三世达赖的“弄单”（神的预言），遍发各地，说：“共产党来了就要灭教”、“红色的俄罗斯是宗教的敌人”。“弄单”上并公开提出“僧俗团结共同反对共产党”的反动口号，企图抗拒解放，以破坏祖国的统一。西藏和平解放后，他们就集中力量反对和平解放西藏十七条协议的实施。他们除了利用西藏地方政府作为反动活动的中心外，还组织了号称“背盟孟”这样一个反动组织，在各地进行反动活动。这个反动组织的根本主张是：分裂祖国统一，要搞帝国主义和外国反动派所策划的什么“西藏独立”
  “藏人独立”。他们不仅想把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，还野心勃勃地想把西康和云南的藏族地区也置于他们的统辖之下，一起分裂出去。当中央根据宪法中的民族区域自治政策和西藏人民的要求，在1956年成立西藏自治区筹备委员会后，他们又起来反对自治区筹备委员会，反对进步人士和人民群众参加政治活动，散布谣言，煽动上层分子起来反对民族区域自治，巩固他们反动分子所把持的原西藏地方政府，同中央对抗，蓄集力量，实现脱离祖国的所谓“西藏独立”，等待时机，进行全面叛乱。远在一九五五年，就在西藏周围制造一些零星的叛匪活动，以巩固其反动中心。
    一九五五年以后康巴地区和我们云南迪庆藏族自治州部分地区的叛乱，就是西藏反动集团策划和组织的。一九五五年反动分子赤江·罗桑益西从北京回西藏，有意取道昌都、乡城，在这些地区进行了一系列的反动活动。召开了寺庙和头人代表会议，全盘策划了叛乱，确定就地发动武装，建立组织指挥的系统，筹划了武器给养的来源，规定了叛乱的日期，提出了“藏族联合，赶走汉人”“僧俗团结，驱汉独立”等反动口号，赤江·罗桑益西回拉萨后，亲自发布了发动叛乱的命令，叛乱发生后反动集团就多方给予支持，从察偶、碧士号地给土匪运送弹药，发“护身符咒”，在拉萨为打死的土匪“念经超度”，并一再叫喊要坚持下去，不要投降。但是出于反动集团的意料之外，藏族人民并不支持他们，土匪叛乱被迅速地平息下去了。反动分子为了掩盖他们背叛祖国的阴谋，散布所谓康巴地区的叛乱是由于改革中不执行政策引起的谰言，这显然是骗不了人的。我们知道，藏族地区的改革，中央和地方一贯坚持采取和平协商的办法，但由于上层反动分子不肯接受和平改革的办法，并且拿起武器来反对改革，进行叛乱，只有在这种情况下，人民解放军才起来平息叛乱，难道说还不应该吗？反动分子总是把自己装饰成为民族利益的保护者，他们叫嚷什么“叛乱是为了反抗民族压迫”，“为了民族不消灭”，把西藏解放诬蔑为在“藏族身上加了一道绳索”。人人知道，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团长期残酷野蛮的统治压迫农牧人民，把西藏变成了人间地狱。人人也知道，西藏解放几年来，党和中央政府给藏族人民带来的好处是说不完的，就以我们云南迪庆藏族自治州来说，在短短的几年内，就获得了几千年也办不到的辉煌成就。农业生产有了显著的发展，粮食亩产量由原来的一百多斤提高到二百五十多斤，总产量由三千多万斤增加到七千多万斤，从来没有工业的高原上，现在出现了机械厂，农具厂，发电站，毛纺，皮革等工厂。其他文教卫生，交通运输的发展也是很迅速的。人民生活也有了很显著的改善和提高，过去多数人不要说吃酥油，盐巴和茶叶也吃不上，许多人连麻布衣衫也很破烂，现在大多数人有了盐、茶和酥油，穿上了棉布衣服，摆脱了几千年的贫困生活。这种情况充分说明只有共产党才是解开藏族人民身上绳索的救星，如果不是共产党领导全州各族人民进行土地改革，走上了社会主义的道路，藏族人民过幸福生活是不可能的。再以西藏地区的情况来说，虽然反动派阻碍了社会制度的改革，阻碍着生产的发展，但是如果和过去相比，仍然有了很大的变化和发展。至于那些口口声声为“民族利益”的反动派，给了藏族人民什么呢？除了剥削压迫欺骗人民外，再没有其他。西藏反动集团给叛乱分子的指示中说：“杀死一个民族积极分子，等于念一亿遍天字真经；杀死一个民族干部，等于念二亿遍天字真经”。在他们的指示下，叛乱分子大批屠杀本民族群众和干部，而且用尽了一切残酷的手段，有的被挖掉眼睛，有的被割掉耳朵和鼻子，有的被开肠破肚，挖出了心肝，有的用火活活的烧死，这些惨无人道的行为，难道说就是西藏人民的“民族利益”吗？他们这一小撮反动统治阶级，摧残和毁灭自己的民族、把藏族人民永远陷在人间活地狱里。
    反动集团又把自己装扮成“宗教的保护者”进行欺骗。他们说什么“许多喇嘛被杀，僧人被抓去修路，武装部队摧毁许多寺庙”、“对行使宗教自由权的干涉增加了”等，挑拨教徒和党与政府军队的关系，便于他们利用群众进行背叛的活动，人人知道，党的宗教信仰自由政策和尊重少数民族风俗习惯的政策，不仅在共同纲领，宪法上作了庄严的规定，而且是坚持贯彻执行了的。就以我们迪庆地区的事实来说，几年来宗教一直得到政府的保护，许多活佛和喇嘛，获得了政治上的安排和生活的补贴，正当的宗教活动，受到尊重和保护，相反地，有一些宗教寺庙，却被反动派利用来作为叛乱活动的中心，一些活佛和喇嘛，披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动，这些人受到国家法律的制裁，是完全罪该应得的，拉萨地区的宗教寺庙，正当的宗教活动，及民族风俗习惯，受到政府的充分保护和尊重，也是有目共睹的。叫唤什么“为护教而战”的反动派，显然是别有用心的，佛教是以慈悲为本，普渡众生，杀生为宗教的主要戒律。但是叛乱分子却专干杀人，放火，抢掠，奸淫的勾当，甚至于捣毁佛堂，抢掠寺院财物，事实说明破坏宗教的并不是别人，恰恰就是这些装出一副虔诚模样，说是希望人们同登天堂的反动分子。为了真正的宗教信仰自由，维护宗教的尊严，必须坚决声讨这些披着袈裟的反动分子。
    西藏上层反动集团和帝国主义、外国反动派的一切诬蔑和造谣，都是骗不了人的，他们的目的，无不是为了分裂祖国统一，把西藏变成外国的殖民地或保护国找借口，西藏是中国不可分的一部分，藏族人民和汉族人民长久以来结成了血肉不能分的关系。谁要分裂祖国的统一，谁要分裂汉藏民族的团结，他不仅是藏族人民的敌人，而且是全国各族人民的公敌。人人得起而诛之。我们平息西藏叛乱，是中国人民自己的事，不容许任何人干涉，印度的扩张主义者，竟公然干涉起我国的内政来，甚至公然叫嚣印度宣布“西藏独立”，印度应继承英帝国主义对西藏的“垄断权”，除了恶毒地攻击我国外，更侮辱我们各族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，真是已经狂妄到极点，是可忍，孰不可忍！这些扩张主义分子把我国出于爱护中印两国人民的友谊的容忍精神，视为软弱可欺，这些人未免把事情估计错了，头脑已经热得发昏了。他们忘记了帝国主义在世界上，作威作福的时代已经过去了。中国人民已经是巍然屹立于自己土地上的主人，任人宰割的时代已经永去不复返了，我们愿和印度邻邦巩固我们之间的友谊，如果有人误认为我们可欺，还想继承英帝国主义的衣钵，或是乘此捞点什么东西，那实在是妄想。谁要把手伸进我们的西藏，那末我们是不会再客气的，我们一定斩断他的魔手，让他吃到教训。西藏反动叛国集团，你们对祖国犯下了滔天罪行，罪不容诛，如果你们还要执迷不悟，妄想继续依附外国反动势力，做你们出卖祖国出卖民族，继续与祖国为敌到底，那末终将逃不脱人民的严厉惩罚。现在你们的叛乱已被粉碎，你们如能及早悔改，向祖国人民请罪，祖国仍对你们留有宽大之门，你们善自选择。我们也希望达赖喇嘛摆脱反动分子的劫持，重新回到祖国的怀抱来。
    为了维护祖国的神圣统一，维护藏族人民的利益，西藏各阶层僧俗人民在共产党的领导下，紧密地团结起来，坚决拥护和协助政府和人民解放军彻底平息叛乱，坚决粉碎帝国主义和国外反动派挑拨和分裂祖国统一的阴谋活动，反对任何形式的分裂民族团结和祖国统一的行为，我们少数民族离开共产党的领导，离开祖国大家庭，除了沦为帝国主义的殖民地之外，是不可能有任何前途的。同时，我们迫切希望在平定叛乱，安定社会秩序的基础上，在党和国家的领导下，早日实现西藏地方的民族区域自治。并依据宪法精神和西藏的具体情况，积极准备条件，迅速确定民主改革的时间，以早日实现西藏广大人民渴望已久的土地改革，把生产力从农奴制度下解放出来，所有各少数民族的共同经验证明，任何民族不经过民主改革，要过渡到社会主义是根本不可能的。现在西藏反动集团已经彻底失败了，西藏人民实行社会民主改革的愿望，肯定可以实现了，我们愿意看到，在不久的时间内，西藏人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在全国各族人民的帮助下，一定走上社会主义的光明大道，并逐步地把西藏高原建设成真正的人间乐园。
