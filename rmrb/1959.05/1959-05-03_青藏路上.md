On the Qinghai-Tibet Road
By our reporters Guo Chaoren and Yang Liben

    Starting from the Qilian Mountain Gorge, crossing the Tanggula Mountains, passing through the northern Tibetan grasslands, and reaching the ancient city of Lhasa in Tibet, what tremendous changes have taken place in the areas along the more than 2,000-kilometer Qinghai-Tibet Highway in just five short years!

    At the foot of the snow-capped mountains, ten thousand mu of fertile fields have appeared, with lush and verdant rice seedlings. Among the desolate cliffs, chimneys stand tall, and machines roar. On the sandy beaches where only wild animals once roamed, countless houses have sprung up, and new towns stand tall before people...

    In the winter of 1953, General Mu Shengzhong, director of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureau, led the first camel team to explore the route, crossing the Qaidam Basin and arriving on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Looking out at the Kunlun Mountains, the wind and snow were blinding, the Arton grasslands were covered in yellow sand, and everything was desolate. Building a long highway on the roof of the world not only faced the problem of road construction, but also required self-reliance to create living conditions so that the vast number of workers could settle down and establish themselves on the plateau.

    “Salt Sea” Grows Vegetables and Sheep Fill the Hillsides

    As soon as people arrived at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, they reclaimed a piece of wasteland to try planting crops. This is the "Kunlun" Farm in Golmud.

    Highway builders awakened the eternally sleeping land. In high-altitude and cold regions thousands of meters above sea level, farms, pastures, vegetable gardens, flower gardens, and orchards appeared for the first time. Dense crops were grown on the sandy beaches, and herds of cattle and sheep grazed on the rarely visited mountains. Qinghai-Tibet Highway workers began to eat the grain and vegetables they produced, as well as the meat and dairy products from their own pastures.

    Golmud is a famous "Salt Sea." During the dry season, the salt and alkali powder on the ground is like a layer of white snow. When a hoe is used to dig into it, it makes a "kach" sound, indicating that it has hit a crystal salt block. Some agricultural theory books say that soil with a salt and alkali content exceeding a certain limit cannot grow crops. According to this statement, this place should be designated as an "agricultural restricted area." However, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway workers were not discouraged. They said: We cannot wait for nature's gifts; we must take from nature! They used snow water from the mountains to wash away the salt and alkali in the soil, and used gypsum produced nearby to change the soil composition. Over the past five years, they have turned thousands of acres of saline-alkali land into farmland and successfully tested more than forty kinds of crops, including fourteen kinds of grain crops alone. Now, this farm has more than 20,000 mu of cultivated land, dozens of tractors and trucks of different horsepower, and has begun to replace some manual labor.

    Horticulturist Wei Chengshu is sixty-nine years old. He came to the foot of the Kunlun Mountains with the first camel team. Five years of experimentation have enabled him to master the climate, soil, and crop growth patterns here. After many failures, he finally successfully cultivated watermelons, tomatoes, and beans and other vegetables on the plateau. The largest watermelon weighs fifteen pounds. In the garden he manages, apple trees, apricot trees, plum trees, and jujube trees have all survived and sprouted, and apricot trees are expected to blossom next spring. Even in the ice-bound season, Wei Chengshu's greenhouse still has pots of flowers. In recent years, the dozens of famous flowers successfully cultivated by the old man have blossomed for the first time at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains.

    Mineral Deposits Cover the Mountains, Products Supplied to All Directions

    Most areas along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway do not grow trees, and it is difficult to see even weeds in some areas. How to solve the fuel problem to survive here and build a modern highway? As soon as the highway workers arrived on the plateau, they decided to look for coal mines. They turned to geological science books to gain knowledge about coal mines, but the authors said, "There is no coal on the plateau." When asked if the local Tibetan people had seen coal mines, the Tibetan people could not understand at all, because there is no word for "coal" in the Tibetan language. Their ancestors relied on cow dung and grass roots as their main fuel.

    Is there no coal mine on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is rich in mineral resources? They didn't believe it. They carried dry rations and hammers and went into the mountains to look for them. They finally found high-quality coal in the Qilian Mountain Gorge, Kunlun Mountain Pass, Tanggula Mountain foothills, northern Tibetan grasslands, and along the Lhasa River. Once, several road maintenance workers went hunting and chased a wounded wild goat to a steep mountain ridge. The wild goat disappeared, but they saw piles of black and shiny stones. The workers were surprised: it's coal! After some exploration, a coal mine was discovered. This mine is not only of good quality but also has a large reserve. Later, people called it the "Wild Goat Coal Mine." The Wuli Coal Mine, Kunlun Coal Mine, and Xidatan Coal Mine, distributed along the highway, have already met the fuel needs of the areas along the line. Not long ago, the workers mined the first coal mine in Tibet near Lhasa. For the first time since ancient times, the Tibetan people, who relied on burning cow dung, burned coal.

    In recent years, the workers on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway have built salt factories wherever they pass salt lakes, built earthen blast furnaces wherever they find iron ore, set up brick and tile factories wherever there is clay, mined borax in the lake areas, and diverted mountain floods to generate electricity... Today, their self-made bricks and tiles and wood have been supplied to the areas along the highway, and the steel on the Kunlun Mountains has provided raw materials for automobile repair shops. The leather factory makes leather jackets and leather boots suitable for the characteristics of the plateau for the vast number of workers. The food processing factory uses potatoes and flour to make various delicious snacks and food. These self-run factories produce thousands of tons of products every year, which has strongly promoted the development of highway construction and transportation, and has also greatly reduced the burden on the country.

    Buildings Rise from the Ground, New Cities Built in the Wilderness

    From the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai to the dense forests in the deep mountains of Tibet, from the Thirty-Nine Tribes Grassland to the Yadong River Valley on the northern slopes of the Himalayas, new market towns and settlements have been established in the areas through which the Qinghai-Tibet Road and its branch lines pass.

    On the grassland at the northern foot of the Kunlun Mountains, which was originally a reed swamp, a bustling new city has appeared - Golmud. When people first came here, it was difficult to see even a tent. In winter, wind and snow intertwined, and even bears huddled in caves. In summer, big black mosquitoes flew all over the sky, chasing and stinging people. However, people who were encouraged by a beautiful tomorrow believed that this was a place with great potential. Now, Golmud stands tall on the grassland like a giant. Magnificent buildings, rolling smoke, and a large-scale automobile repair shop have been built. Many small factories are scattered around the city. It is growing and developing rapidly.

    The streets in the urban area are wide and flat, and some sections are paved with asphalt. Some of these streets are called "Voluntary Labor Road," and some are called "Communist Saturday Road," all of which were built by the workers themselves. More than 500,000 saplings of poplar and weeping willow are planted in the forest nurseries along the road, which looks as green as a carpet. The huge station is located at the southern end of the urban area. The cars dispatched here run south to Lhasa, north to Xiadong in Gansu, east to Xining, and west to Xinjiang, making it a highway transportation hub on the grassland. The newly built guest house building opposite welcomes hundreds of passing passengers every day and is the largest guest house on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. To the west of the urban area is the first theater on the grassland, which can accommodate 800 people watching a performance at a time. Shopping malls, banks, post offices, bookstores, and restaurants are neatly arranged together. The area of office buildings and staff dormitories is several tens of thousands of square meters. Elementary schools and kindergartens are located in the city center, and the children's laughter adds infinite joy to the city.

    In just five short years, what a miracle the heroic Qinghai-Tibet Highway workers have created with their own hands! Along the long highway, the desolation of the past is rapidly disappearing, and a more prosperous and beautiful tomorrow is beckoning to the people.

    青藏路上
    本报记者　郭超人　杨立本
    从祁连山峡开始、翻过唐古拉山，穿过藏北草原，直达西藏古城拉萨，两千多公里的青藏公路干线经过的地方，短短的五年，发生了多么巨大的变化！
    常年积雪的山麓出现了万亩良田，丛密的秧苗青葱一片。荒无人迹的崖岭间，烟囱林立，机器轰鸣。曾经只有野兽出没的沙滩上，升起数不清的房屋，一座座新兴的城镇耸立在人们的面前……。
    1953年冬，青藏公路局局长慕生忠将军带领第一批探路的骆驼队，穿过柴达木盆地来到青藏高原时，遥望昆仑，风雪迷茫，阿尔顿草原黄沙滚滚，满目荒凉。在这世界屋脊上修筑漫长的公路，面临的不单是修路问题，同时还要自力更生，创造生活条件，使广大职工能够在高原上安家立业。
    “盐海”长蔬菜牛羊满山坡
    人们刚到昆仑山下，就开垦了一片荒地试种农作物，这就是格尔木的“昆仑”农场。
    公路建设者们唤醒了亘古沉睡的土地。海拔数千公尺的高寒地区，第一次出现了农场、牧场、菜园、花圃和果木园林。沙滩上种出了茂密的庄稼，人迹罕到的山岭间放牧着成群的牛羊。青藏公路职工们开始吃到了自己生产的粮食和蔬菜，自己牧场的肉类和奶品。
    噶尔穆是著名的“盐海”，气候干燥的季节，地面上的盐碱粉末像一层白雪，镢头挖下去“卡赤”作响，这是碰到了结晶盐块。一些农业理论书说，含盐碱量超过一定限度的土壤就不能生长庄稼，根据这种说法，这里应当划为“农业禁区”。但是，青藏公路职工们毫不气馁。他们说：不能等待自然恩赐，要向自然索取！他们利用山中的雪水冲走了土里的盐碱，用附近出产的石膏改变土壤成分。五年来，他们把几千亩盐碱地变成了农田，试种成功四十多种农作物，仅粮食作物就有十四种。现在，这个农场拥有两万多亩耕地，十几台不同马力的拖拉机和运载汽车，开始代替了一部分手工劳动。
    园艺家魏承叔六十九岁了，他是随第一批骆驼队来到昆仑山下的，五年的试验使他掌握了这里的气候、土壤和农作物生长的规律。经过多次失败，终于在高原上试种成西瓜和蕃茄、豆角等蔬菜，最大的西瓜重十五斤。在他经营的园圃里，苹果树、杏树、李树、枣树，都成活抽芽，杏树明春可望开花。即使在冰封雪冻的季节，魏承叔的温室里还能看到一盆盆鲜花。几年来，老人培育成功的十几种名花，第一次开放在昆仑山下。
    矿藏布山间，产品供四方
    青藏公路沿线大部分地区不长树木，有些地区连野草都很难看到。要在这里生存，并建设一条现代化的公路，燃料怎么解决？公路职工们一到高原就决定寻找煤矿。他们翻开地质科学书籍，想获得关于煤矿的知识，可是著书的人却说“高原无煤”。询问当地藏族人民见过煤矿没有，藏族人民根本听不懂，因为藏语中没有“煤”这个字，他们祖祖辈辈靠牛粪和草根作主要燃料。
    矿藏丰富的青藏高原上没有煤矿？他们不相信，他们背上口粮，提着铁锤，到深山里寻找，他们终于在祁连山峡、昆仑山口，唐古拉山麓、藏北草原和拉萨河畔找到了质量很好的煤。有一次，几个养路工人出外打猎，追赶负伤的野羊来到一座险峻的山岭，野羊不见了，却看到一堆堆石块乌黑发亮。工人们很惊奇：是煤！经过一番勘查，一座煤矿发现了。这座矿不仅质好，而且储量大，后来人们就叫他“野羊煤矿”。分布在公路沿线的乌丽煤矿，昆仑煤矿，西大滩煤矿等，已经满足了沿线地区的燃料需要。不久前，职工们在拉萨近郊开采了西藏第一座煤矿，自古以来靠烧牛粪的藏族人民，第一次烧到了煤。
    几年来，青藏公路的职工经过盐湖就建立盐厂，发现铁矿，就垒筑土高炉，那里有胶泥就开办砖瓦厂，在湖泊地带就采硼砂，把山洪引来发电……。今天，他们自制的砖瓦和木材，已经供应到公路沿线，昆仑山上的钢铁为汽车修配厂提供了原材料。皮革厂为广大职工制做适应高原特点的皮袄和皮靴。食品加工厂用马铃薯和面粉做成各种美味的点心和食品。这些自办的工厂每年生产成千上万吨产品，有力地促进了公路建设和运输事业的发展，也大大减轻了国家的负担。
    楼房平地起，荒野建新城
    从青海柴达木盆地到西藏的深山密林间，从三十九族草原到喜马拉雅山北麓的亚东河谷，青藏路及其支线经过的地方，建立起一座座新兴的集镇和居民点。
    原是一片芦苇滩的昆仑山北麓草原上，出现了人烟熙攘的新城——噶尔穆。当人们刚来到这里，连帐篷也很难看到一顶。冬天，风雪交加，狗熊都蜷缩在洞里。夏天，又黑又大的蚊子满天飞，追着叮人。但是，为美好的明天所鼓舞的人们却认为，这里正是大有可为的地方。现在，噶尔穆像巨人一样耸立在草原上。建筑巍峨，烟云翻滚，一座大型的汽车修配厂已经建成了。许多个小型工厂，散布在城市的四周。一日千里地成长、发展着。
    市区的街道宽阔平坦，还有一段铺上了柏油路面，这些街道有的叫“义务劳动路”，有的叫“共产主义礼拜六路”，都是职工们亲身修筑的。路旁林圃里插着五十多万株白杨和垂柳的树苗，望过去碧绿如茵。庞大的车站设在市区南端，这里派出的汽车，南通拉萨，北到甘肃的峡东，东抵西宁，西达新疆境内，是草原上公路交通的枢纽。对面新建的招待所大楼，每天迎接着几百位过往旅客，是青藏公路上最大的招待所。市区西边，是草原上第一座剧场，他每次可以容纳八百人看戏。商场、银行、邮局、书店、饭店整齐地排列在一起。机关房屋和职工宿舍的面积有好几万平方公尺，小学和幼儿园都设在市中心，孩子们的喧笑为城市增添了无限欢乐。
    短短的五年，英雄的青藏公路职工们，用双手创造出了何等的奇迹！漫长的公路沿线，昔日的荒凉正在迅速消逝，更繁荣更美好的明天，在向人们招手。
