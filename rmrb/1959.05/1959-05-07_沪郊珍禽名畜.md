　　Shanghai's Suburban Precious Birds and Famous Livestock
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Hongxian

    Shanghai is not only a bustling industrial and commercial city, but its suburbs also produce many precious birds and famous livestock.

    Pudong Chicken
    Have you ever seen such a big chicken? When it raises its head, it is taller than a five-year-old child. This is the famous Pudong chicken.

    The Pudong chicken has a yellow beak and yellow feet. The feathers on the rooster are bright red or golden yellow, and the general weight is nine to ten *jin* (approximately 4.5-5 kg). The feathers on the hen are light red or speckled, and the weight must also be seven to nine *jin* (approximately 3.5-4.5 kg). Chen Mulou, a farmer in Nicheng Commune, Nanhui County, raised a rooster that weighed 15.5 *jin* (7.75 kg). A Pudong hen lays 220 eggs per year, each weighing two *liang* (approximately 100g).

    Who in Shanghai doesn't compete for Pudong chicken? Its meat is tender and delicious, and rich in fat.

    This year, the Pudong area is vigorously developing this type of chicken. Nanhui County alone plans to develop four million chickens, a twenty-fold increase over last year. The chicks hatched in spring have now broken out of their shells in large numbers and are chasing and playing happily in the sun.

    Songjiang Four-Gill Bass
    Anyone who has been to Songjiang County wants to taste the four-gill bass. Every year from the winter solstice to the Spring Festival, when the four-gill bass is on the market, the restaurants in Songjiang are packed.

    Songjiang four-gill bass is tender, delicious, and fatty. It is said that Cao Cao, Bai Juyi, and Su Dongpo all wrote articles and poems praising it.

    The output of four-gill bass is very small and cannot meet the needs of the people. Last year, a fishery brigade in Chengbei Commune, Songjiang County, began artificial breeding for the first time, with a survival rate of 87%, which is fatter and larger than natural bass.

    Chuansha Dairy Cattle
    Chuansha dairy cattle are of good quality and quantity, and are known as the "hometown of dairy cattle". At present, the pastures in Chuansha County produce 16,000 *jin* (8,000 kg) of milk every day, which is made into milk powder, condensed milk, candy, and other dairy products by Shanghai food factories and supplied to all parts of the country.

    The purebred Chuansha dairy cattle are tall and plump in shape, with black and white colors all over the body, majestic and beautiful. It is said that this was successfully cultivated by the people of Chuansha decades ago by hybridizing Dutch dairy cattle with local fine yellow cattle. This type of dairy cattle can generally produce 30 to 40 *jin* (15-20 kg) of milk per cow per day, and some can produce as much as 70 to 80 *jin* (35-40 kg), with a fat content of 4.5%.

    Chuansha dairy cattle are resistant to coarse feed, have strong disease resistance, and have a long lifespan. They can adapt to the living conditions of different climates and soils in various places, and can also engage in farming. Chuansha dairy cattle supported in other places are welcomed everywhere.

    Shanghai White Pig
    The Shanghai White Pig has a beautiful appearance, a tall body, and grows white and large.

    Last year, the Shanghai Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Research Station conducted a comparative test. The growth rate, litter size, and survival rate of Shanghai White Pigs were higher than those of British Yorkshire pigs.

    Shanghai White Pig has thick meat, thin skin, high meat yield, and a delicate taste, and has a good reputation in the international market.

    It is said that the Shanghai White Pig contains the blood of at least five different breeds, and it concentrates the advantages of various pigs. This type of pig is now basically finalized. This year, farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai will vigorously breed and promote this famous pig.

　　沪郊珍禽名畜
　　本报记者　王洪仙
    上海，不仅是一座繁华的工商业都市，而且在它的郊区还出产着许许多多珍禽名畜。
    浦东鸡
    你见过这么大的鸡吗？它昂起头来比五岁小孩还要高。这就是有名的浦东鸡。
    浦东鸡黄嘴、黄脚，公鸡身上的羽毛鲜红或金黄，一般体重九到十市斤；母鸡身上的羽毛淡红或芦花色，体重也要有七到九市斤。南汇县泥城公社农民陈木楼养的一只公鸡，重十五斤半，一只浦东母鸡年产蛋二百二十只，每只重二两。
    上海人谁不争食浦东鸡？它的肉细嫩鲜美，脂肪丰厚。
    今年浦东地区大力发展这种鸡。仅南汇县就计划发展四百万只，比去年增加二十倍。春孵的小鸡，现在已大批破蛋出壳，在阳光下活泼地追逐游戏。
    松江四鳃鲈
    到过松江县的人，都想尝一尝四鳃鲈鱼。每年从冬至到春节期间，是四鳃鲈上市的时候，松江的饭馆座无虚席。
    松江四鳃鲈肉鲜嫩肥美。相传曹操、白居易、苏东坡都著文作诗夸赞。
    四鳃鲈产量很少，远不能满足人民需要。去年松江县城北公社有一个渔业大队第一次开始进行人工试养，成活率达87％，比天然鲈鱼还肥大。
    川沙奶牛
    川沙奶牛，质好量多，素称“奶牛之乡”。现在，川沙县各牧场每天出产一万六千斤牛奶，由上海的食品厂把它制成奶粉、炼乳、糖果等乳制品供应全国各地。
    川沙的纯种奶牛，体形高大而丰满，全身色泽黑白相间，雄壮美观。据说，这是几十年前，川沙人民用荷兰奶牛与当地良种黄牛进行杂交，培育成功的。这种奶牛，一天一般每条牛能出奶三四十斤，产量高的也有七八十斤，脂肪含量4.5％。
    川沙奶牛耐粗饲料，抗病力强，寿命长，能适应各地不同气候和水土的生活条件，同时还能从事耕作。川沙支援外地的奶牛，受到各地欢迎。
    上海大白猪
    上海大白猪外貌美观，体型高大，长得又白又大。
    去年上海市畜牧兽医研究站，对比试验，上海白猪的生长速度、产仔率和成活率都比英国的约克夏种猪高。
    上海白猪肉厚、皮薄、出肉率高，味道细嫩，在国际市场上声誉很好。
    据说，上海白猪至少含有五种不同品种的血统，它把各种猪的优点都集中在一起了。这种猪现在基本上定型了。今年上海郊区农民将大力繁殖和推广这种名猪。
