    Historically, barbers have always stood to cut hair. The Wuhan State-run Second Barber Shop has created a barber's work chair. It's a seat with small wheels underneath, making it nimble and light, rotating freely in all directions. The chair is also equipped with a tool tray, making work very convenient.
