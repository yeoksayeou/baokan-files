    The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in the eastern part of the Kangzang Plateau, between the Jinsha River and the Dadu River. It borders the Qamdo area to the west, the Sichuan Basin to the east, Yunnan to the south, and Qinghai to the north. It covers an area of approximately 150,000 square kilometers, about the size of Anhui Province. The territory boasts magnificent mountains and rivers such as the Erlang Mountains, Zheduo Mountains, Que'er Mountains, as well as the Jinsha River, Dadu River, and Yalong River. The prefecture has a total population of 540,000, mainly Tibetan, numbering over 440,000. The remaining population consists of Han, Yi, Hui, and other ethnic groups. It is rich in resources. According to a 1958 survey, various regions possess 36 types of mineral resources, including mica, asbestos, gold, coal, iron, lead, zinc, crystal, gypsum, Iceland spar, and beryl. The mica deposits in Danba are renowned throughout the country for their reserves and quality. The vast forests along the Jinsha River and Yalong River are among the few large forest areas discovered in China. Musk, Cordyceps, Fritillaria, and Anemarrhena are its four major specialties, with musk production accounting for 70% of the country's total output. Due to its excellent quality, it is known as "Lu Xiang" (Lu refers to Dajianlu, the old name of Kangding). Deer antler, marmot fur, and other products are also known nationwide for their quality and quantity. (Attached picture)
