	In a Frontline Village
	Our Correspondent in Fujian
	Just as the acacia flowers were filling the air with fragrance, we arrived in Xiamen. Along the way, we saw the fields of the frontline People's Communes lush with green rice paddies. The frontline people, who bear the important task of fighting the enemy, have been persistent in production and have cultivated the land so well, which is truly inspiring. With this excitement, we couldn't wait to rush to He厝乡, which stands on the front line. Although the front line is relatively calm now, and sporadic artillery fire is only heard on odd-numbered days, one cannot help but feel a strong frontline atmosphere upon arriving in Xiamen, especially at the front. He厝乡 is separated from the enemy-occupied Jinmen Island by only a ten-plus-mile stretch of sea. On clear days like these, one can see the enemy's activities on Little Jinmen Island. But the people of this heroic village always labor fearlessly. The broken walls left by enemy shells can still be seen, but not a single hole made by enemy shells remains; all the land pockmarked by shelling has been filled in. All the land that could be planted has been planted with crops.
	
	The people of He厝乡, with a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other, are determined to both defend their homes and do a good job in production. They take turns on sentry duty, monitoring the enemy across the water with sharp eyes. Despite the limited labor force, they have planted 331 mu of rice, 513 mu of sorghum, 290 mu of peanuts, 460 mu of vegetables, and other crops this year. They also plan to harvest 700,000 pieces of oysters and fish in the nearby sea.
	
	This year's rice harvest here will be higher than last year's. Township cadres say this is because the commune members are highly motivated, planted early, selected good seeds, and used appropriate close planting. Before close planting, the commune members absorbed the opinions of experienced farmers and discussed together, so they were able to adapt to local conditions. The commune members maintain the spirit of hard and skillful work under fire from last year. One afternoon, the People's Liberation Army troops invited the masses of this village to watch a movie, but the commune members refused to put down their work, preferring to sacrifice the movie. The soldiers, concerned for the masses, came to help the commune members and moved the movie to the evening. To compensate for the lack of fertilizer, the commune members sent boats to distant parts of Xiamen to transport manure and plan to catch some aquatic products for fertilizer. In the past, residents of this village would either go to the sea or work the land, but now commune members return to the land after coming back from the sea.
	
	He厝乡 has produced many model figures in support of the front and production, and the Ten Sisters are one such group. Their ages range from sixteen to twenty-four, averaging only seventeen. They formed sisterhood while sewing and washing large quantities of clothes for the soldiers at the same support-the-front post. Now they still work and live together, and each of them is full of vigor in production. When we met them, they were picking up cabbage leaves for feeding pigs from the ground and taking them back to the commune. The eldest sister, He Huiqin, the fourth sister, He Xuezhen, and the sixth sister, He Suhua, took the time to tell us about their recent situation. They told us that the People's Liberation Army soldiers told them not to sew and wash clothes when there was no shelling, so they concentrated their efforts on production. In addition to jointly cultivating a 1.4 mu rice experimental plot and a 2 mu high-yield sorghum plot, they do any work assigned by the organization. The eldest sister, He Huiqin, weaned her one-year-old child last year and sent the child to the rear to wash more clothes for the soldiers. Now, in order to persist in production with her sisters, she is unwilling to go to the rear. The second sister, He Caizhi, and an old and a young commune member raise one hundred pigs. She takes great care of the pigs, bathing them every two days, and raises them very well. The production team to which the Ten Sisters belong is faster than other teams in accumulating fertilizer and carrying manure. They, like all the commune members, work from five to seven in the morning, then from eight to eleven after breakfast, and from two-thirty to six-thirty in the afternoon. They also often use their noon break to pick up fertilizer everywhere.
	
	The people of He厝乡, who persist in production and persist in fighting the enemy, are so motivated and selflessly striving for a double harvest of agricultural and marine products this year. (Miao Di Illustration) (Attached picture)

    在前沿乡村
    本报驻福建记者
    正当相思树花香扑鼻的时候，我们来到了厦门。一路上我们看到前线人民公社的田地上水稻长得一片葱绿，负有对敌斗争重要任务的前线人民，一直坚持生产，还把地种得这样好，真是令人兴奋。我们怀着这种兴奋的心情，迫不及待地跑到屹立在前线的何厝乡去。虽然现在前线比较平静，逢单日才听到零星的炮声，但是一到厦门，特别是前沿，就不能不感到强烈的前线气氛。何厝乡和敌人占领的金门岛只隔一个十多华里的海面。在这晴朗的日子里，可以望见小金门岛上敌人的活动。但这个英雄乡的人民总是那么无畏地劳动着。敌人炮弹打成的断墙残壁还可以看见，敌人炮弹打成的土坑却一个也不见了；所有被打成坑的土地都填平了。所有来得及种的土地都种上了庄稼。
    一手端枪，一手拿锄的何厝乡人民，决心既要保家，又要搞好生产。他们轮流站岗放哨，用锐利的眼睛监视着对岸的敌人。尽管劳动力不多，他们今年种了三百三十一亩水稻，五百一十三亩高粱，二百九十亩花生，四百六十亩蔬菜，还有其他作物。他们还计划收七十万块海蛎和在近海捕鱼。
    这里水稻收成今年将比去年高。乡干部说，这是由于社员干劲高，种得早，种籽选得好，密植得适当。密植前社员吸收了老农的意见，大家一起商量，所以能因地制宜。社员保持着去年那种在炮火下苦干巧干的精神。有一天下午解放军部队邀请这个乡的群众看电影，社员们不肯放下工作，宁愿牺牲电影不看。关心群众的战士们就来帮助社员们，而把电影移到晚间放映。社员们为了弥补肥料的不足，派船到厦门远处运粪，并且打算捕捞一些水产作肥料。往年这个乡的居民是下海的不下地，如今社员们下海回来了又下地。
    何厝乡出过许多支前和生产的模范人物，十姐妹就是其中一群。她们的年龄从十六岁到二十四岁，平均不过十七岁。她们是在同一个支前岗位上为战士们缝洗大批衣服中结成姐妹的。现在她们仍然一起工作一起住，在生产中个个像生龙活虎。当我们见到她们时，她们正把喂猪的包菜叶从地上挑回社里。大姐何惠琴、四姐何雪珍、六姐何素华抽空对我们谈了她们的近况。她们告诉我们，解放军战士说，没有打炮时不让她们缝洗衣服，所以她们集中力量搞生产。除了共种一块一亩四分水稻试验田和一块二亩高粱丰产田外，她们做着组织上分配的任何工作。大姐何惠琴去年为了多洗战士的衣服，把一岁孩子断了奶，送到后方，现在为了跟姐妹们一起坚持生产不愿到后方去。二姐何菜治和一老一小的社员养一百头猪。她养猪很细心，两天给猪洗一次澡，把猪养得很好。十姐妹所在的那一个生产队不论积肥挑粪，干起工作要比别队快。她们和全体社员一样，清早五点到七点干一阵，吃早饭后从八点干到十一点，下午从两点半干到六点半。她们还常常利用中午休息时间四出拣肥。
    坚持生产和坚持对敌斗争的何厝乡人民，就是这样干劲冲天和以忘我的精神争取今年农产海产双丰收。（苗地插图）（附图片）
