    Suzhou Prefecture Launches a Fierce Battle
    Two Diseases Basically Stop Spreading
    (Our newspaper, Suzhou, 19th dispatch) "Seize sunny days, grasp cloudy days, and completely eliminate wheat scab and stem rust in the early stages of onset!" This is the battle cry put forward by the 150,000-strong army in Suzhou Prefecture for the prevention and treatment of wheat diseases and insect pests.
    Since the beginning of May, the Suzhou area has experienced continuous rain and the soil has been relatively humid. In addition, as the temperature gradually rises, wheat scab and stem rust have begun to occur widely, with the incidence rate reaching about 10% in some areas.
    Currently, under the personal leadership of the secretaries of Party committees at all levels, the prevention and treatment army is throwing itself into the final battle with a tenacious fighting spirit. On May 7th, as soon as the rain stopped, the Party committee of Xieqiao Commune in Changshu County immediately issued a battle cry. Within half an hour, all 932 pest control fighters in the commune were assembled. They brought more than 670 sprayers and sprayed lime sulfur mixture in the affected wheat fields. On that day, the pesticide was widely sprayed once in more than 2,100 mu of wheat fields affected by scab and stem rust. In Wujiang County, more than 140,000 mu of wheat fields had water accumulation. The county mobilized more than 35,000 people, nearly 4,000 waterwheels, and more than 100 water pumps to drain the accumulated water from the wheat fields in two or three days. The masses in Taicang, Changshu, and other counties braved the rain to repair the drainage ditches in the wheat fields, ensuring that the fields dried out after the rain stopped.
    Currently, the final battle to eliminate wheat diseases in the Suzhou area is in full swing, and wheat scab and stem rust have basically stopped spreading.

    苏州专区展开一场激战
    两种病害基本停止蔓延
    本报苏州19日电　“抢晴天，抓阴天，把小麦赤霉病、秆锈病彻底消灭在初发阶段！”这是苏州专区十五万防治三麦病虫害大军提出的战斗口号。
    5月初以来，苏州地区连续阴雨，土壤湿度较高；加之气温逐渐上升，小麦赤霉病，秆锈病已开始普遍发生，个别地方发病率已达10％左右。
    目前，防治大军在各级党委书记亲自率领下，以顽强的斗志，投入了最后一个战役。5月7日，雨刚住，常熟县谢桥公社党委立即发出了战斗口号，在半小时内，全社九百三十二名治虫战斗员集中起来了，他们带了六百七十多架喷雾器，在发病的麦田喷石灰硫磺合剂，这一天就在二千一百多亩发生赤霉病，秆锈病的小麦田里普遍喷了一次农药。在吴江县，有十四万多亩麦田有积水，全县出动了三万五千多人，近四千部水车和一百多台戽水机，两三天时间就把麦田积水排光。太仓、常熟等县群众，冒雨整修麦田里的排水沟，保证了雨住田干。
    现在，苏州地区消灭小麦病害的最后战役正在激战中，小麦赤霉病和秆锈病已基本上停止蔓延。
