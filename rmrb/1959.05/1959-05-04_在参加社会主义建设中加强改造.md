Strengthening Transformation Through Participation in Socialist Construction

Comrade Chen Jingshu's Speech

Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

Our current congress is one of great unity and a great leap forward. Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on the Work of the Government," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report" have given us the greatest joy and encouragement. These reports vividly and specifically reflect the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the great leap forward in our socialist construction. I fully support these reports and firmly believe that through this congress, all ethnic groups in our country will achieve greater unity under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and our large-scale socialist construction will make even greater leaps forward.

I am a member of the Hui ethnic group and also an industrialist and businessman. I will share my thoughts from these two perspectives.

Indian Interventionists Have Lost Their Minds

As a member of a minority ethnic group, I deeply appreciate the unparalleled happiness of living in the unified family of our motherland under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Before liberation, imperialists and all reactionaries exhausted all their schemes to sow discord, preventing us from uniting and keeping us in a long-term state of oppression and exploitation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we minority ethnic groups completely shook off the oppression of imperialists and all reactionaries. In the unified family of our motherland, we quickly embarked on the road to prosperity and happiness. In our socialist country, all ethnic groups are politically equal, and we minority ethnic groups fully receive various forms of assistance from the more advanced Han people, who constitute the majority, in economic, political, and cultural fields. In our socialist country, not only has ethnic oppression been fundamentally eliminated, but also the remnants of ethnic discrimination inherited from history are rapidly disappearing. The vast majority of our minority ethnic areas have completed democratic reforms, enabling us to traverse the historical journey that would have taken hundreds or even thousands of years in just a few short years, embarking on the bright road of socialism. This allows us to unite in the unified family of our motherland and work together for the great leap forward in socialist construction, enjoying an increasingly better socialist life.

From the personal experiences of our minority ethnic groups, I express the greatest indignation at the armed rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, betraying the motherland and undermining unity. I feel unparalleled joy and encouragement at our government's wise measures to swiftly quell the rebellion in the Lhasa area. The unity of the motherland is the highest interest of all ethnic groups in the country. The failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Tibet further strengthens the unity of all ethnic groups in the country and allows the Tibetan people to gradually embark on the road to socialist happiness. This is a great victory for our country's ethnic unity policy.

During the period of our congress, Indian diplomatic officials distributed the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," which reversed black and white and fabricated facts. This is an intolerable interference in our country's internal affairs and an insult to our minority ethnic groups. We minority ethnic groups are certainly different from the Han people, but a long historical period has united us in a unified family. We are all an inseparable part of the motherland's family. Imperialists and all reactionaries vainly attempt to alienate us so that they can "divide and rule." Those days will never come again. Indian interventionists have lost their minds and dream of using a small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet to carry out conspiracies in order to achieve their sinister goals. This is something that the people of our country will never allow. If Indian expansionists continue to act recklessly, what awaits them is the same disgraceful end as all imperialists and reactionaries who vainly attempt to interfere in our country, ending in ruin and disgrace.

Transformation and Service are an Indivisible, Mutually Promoting Unity

As an industrialist and businessman, I deeply feel the unparalleled happiness that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system have given us. During the socialist revolution, the main contradiction in our country was originally the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we industrialists and businessmen, under the Party's peaceful transformation policy, accepted a series of educations through the "Five-Anti" campaign, the overall public-private partnership of industries, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the rectification movement. To varying degrees, we have improved our ideological understanding, which has enabled us to unite with the people of the whole country and exert our due strength in the great leap forward in national construction. This is the greatest happiness and the greatest glory for every patriotic industrialist and businessman.

Premier Zhou instructed us in his "Report on the Work of the Government": "For capitalists, the state will pay fixed interest according to the original schedule, and will actively help them continue their self-education and self-transformation in the work of participating in socialist construction." This instruction provides a clear direction for our future self-transformation, which is to strengthen transformation through active service.

Taking the situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Hubei Province and Wuhan City as an example, after several years of continuous education by the Party, especially after the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have made progress to varying degrees. In the great leap forward of socialist construction last year, many people have made certain achievements in various aspects, such as participating in physical labor, improving production technology, and putting forward rationalization proposals and inventions. However, this does not mean that the majority of us in the industrial and commercial circles no longer have duality in our political stance and ideological views, and have solved the question of which path to take between capitalism and socialism.

Between the end of last year and January of this year, the China Democratic NationalConstruction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a joint meeting of the Central and Executive Committees under the leadership of the Party. This meeting affirmed the achievements made by industrialists and businessmen through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and at the same time pointed out that we industrialists and businessmen still need to continue to carry out fundamental transformation. The meeting believed that the main focus of our current fundamental transformation is still the transformation of our political stance, combined with the transformation of our political stance, to gradually break down bourgeois individualism. The method of transformation is to implement a more gentle and subtle spirit, combining encouragement and criticism to better carry out meticulous political and ideological education based on reasoning. The meeting emphasized that our current transformation must be commanded by political and ideological transformation, based on labor, based on enterprises, and combining transformation and service to strengthen transformation in active service. The spirit of this joint meeting of the Central and Executive Committees of our two associations implemented the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of industrialists and businessmen, and it conformed to the actual situation of the current self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen. After the conclusion of the meeting, Hubei Province and Wuhan City, under the leadership of the local Party committee, conveyed, arranged for the study and discussion of the documents and resolutions of this joint meeting. All participating industrialists and businessmen were greatly encouraged and enlightened. The vast majority of them improved their ideological understanding to varying degrees, changed their past aversion to transformation, and further demonstrated their performance in production and labor.

Now, Premier Zhou further instructed us in his "Report on the Work of the Government" that we should continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation in the work of participating in socialist construction. This makes us more aware of the importance of combining transformation and service and strengthening transformation in active service. This is the greatest encouragement to promote and help us strengthen transformation and actively serve. Some people in the industrial and commercial circles used to have insufficient understanding of why transformation and service should be combined. Some even believed that transformation and service were contradictory. Now, we further realize that transformation and service are an indivisible, mutually promoting unity. The relationship between transformation and service is the relationship between knowledge and practice. Knowledge comes from practice and in turn guides practice. Similarly, our transformation must not be separated from service. Transformation can only be carried out in the practice of service, and transformation in turn can promote service. Therefore, in order to change ourselves from exploiters to laborers, and in order to contribute to socialist construction, we industrialists and businessmen must carry out self-transformation in the practice of participating in socialist construction.

Premier Zhou called on us: "We should mobilize the enthusiasm of every worker, farmer, intellectual, and every patriotic citizen ideologically and politically in every corner of the country, and immediately launch a nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy." We industrialists and businessmen must warmly respond to Premier Zhou's call, attach importance to this movement ideologically and politically, unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen our self-transformation consciously under the leadership of the Party, and make more and better contributions to the great cause of socialist construction in the motherland. In the great unity and great leap forward of the motherland, we industrialists and businessmen must march forward together with the people of the whole country.

### 在参加社会主义建设中加强改造

专栏：

    在参加社会主义建设中加强改造
    陈经畬代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们这次大会是一次大团结、大跃进的大会。周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”、李富春副总理所作的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”、李先念副总理所作的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，以及彭真副委员长所作的
  “工作报告”，给了我们最大的欢欣鼓舞。这些报告生动地、具体地反映了我国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的大团结和我国社会主义建设的大跃进。我完全拥护这些报告，并且完全相信通过我们这次大会，我国各族人民一定会在中国共产党领导下得到进一步的大团结，我国规模宏大的社会主义建设将进一步取得更大的跃进。
    我是一个回族的人民，同时又是一个工商业者。我从这两个方面，谈谈我的感想。
    印度干涉者冲昏了头脑
    作为一个少数民族的人民，我深切地体会到我们在中国共产党领导下，生活在祖国统一的大家庭中的无比幸福。在解放以前，帝国主义和一切反动派用尽一切阴谋，进行挑拨离间，使我们不能团结一致，使我们长期处在被压迫、被剥削的悲惨地位。解放以后，我们少数民族在中国共产党领导下，彻底地摆脱了帝国主义和一切反动派的压迫，在祖国统一的大家庭中，很快地走上了兴旺和幸福的道路。在我们社会主义国家里，所有的民族在政治上都是平等的，而且我们少数民族在经济、政治、文化各方面，还充分得到了比较先进的、居于多数地位的汉族的各种帮助。在我们社会主义国家里，不仅民族压迫已经从根本上消灭，就是从历史上遗留下来的民族歧视的残余心理，也正在迅速地消灭中。我们极大多数的少数民族地区，已经完成了民主改革，使我们在短短的几年中，跨越了本来几百年甚至几千年才能走完的历史里程，走上了社会主义的光明大道，使我们在祖国统一的大家庭中，能够团结一致地共同为社会主义建设大跃进而努力，能够享受到越来越美好的社会主义的幸福生活。
    从我们少数民族的切身体会中，我对西藏上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱，表示最大的愤慨；对于我们政府迅速平息拉萨地区叛乱的英明措施，感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益。西藏反革命叛乱的失败，使祖国各民族的团结和统一进一步加强，使西藏人民逐步地走上社会主义幸福道路。这是我国民族团结政策的一个伟大的胜利。
    正在我们大会召开的时期，印度外交官员散发了颠倒黑白、捏造事实的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这是不可容忍的对我国内政的干涉，同样是对我们少数民族的污辱。我们少数民族人民固然不同于汉族人民，但是长期历史时期使我们团结在统一的大家庭中，我们都是祖国大家庭不可分割的一部分。帝国主义和一切反动派妄想离间我们，使他们能够“分而治之”，这种日子是永远不会有了。印度干涉者冲昏了头脑，梦想利用西藏一小撮上层反动分子，来进行阴谋活动，以达到他们的罪恶目的，这是我们全国人民决不能允许的，印度扩张主义分子如果还要蛮干下去，等待他们的必然是和妄想干涉我国的一切帝国主义和反动派一样，落得个身败名裂，不光彩的下场。
    改造和服务是不能分割的、相互促进的统一体
    作为一个工商业者，我深切地感到中国共产党的领导和社会主义制度所给予我们的无比幸福。在社会主义革命时期，我国国内的主要矛盾本来是工人阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾，但是，由于中国共产党的正确领导，我们工商业者在党的和平改造政策下，接受了“五反”、全行业公私合营、以及反右派斗争和整风运动等一系列的教育，在不同程度上都提高了思想认识，这就使我们能够和全国人民团结在一起，在祖国建设大跃进中发挥我们的应有力量。这是每一个爱国的工商业者的最大的幸福，也是最大的光荣。
    周总理在“政府工作报告”中指示我们说：“对于资本家，国家将按照原定的期限付给定息，并且将积极地帮助他们在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造。”这个指示，对于我们今后的自我改造给予了明确的方针，这个方针就是在积极服务中加强改造。
    以我们湖北省和武汉市的工商界情况来说，几年来经过党的不断的教育，特别是经过反右派斗争和整风运动，极大多数的工商业者在不同程度上都有进步，在去年的社会主义建设大跃进中，不少的人在参加体力劳动、改进生产技术，以及提出合理化建议和创造发明等各方面，都有一定的成就。但是，这并不能说，我们工商界的多数人在政治立场和思想观点上已经没有两面性，已经解决了资本主义和社会主义两条道路何去何从的问题。
    在去年年底到今年一月间，中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会在党的领导下召开了一次中、执委联席会议，这次会议肯定了工商业者经过反右派斗争和整风运动所取得的成就，同时指出了我们工商业者还要继续进行根本改造。会议认为，我们工商业者当前的根本改造主要的仍然是政治立场的改造，结合政治立场的改造，逐步破资产阶级个人主义思想。改造的方式是贯彻更为和风细雨的精神，把鼓励和批评结合起来，更好地进行细致说理的政治思想教育。会议强调地指出，我们当前的改造必须以政治思想改造为统帅，以劳动为基础，以企业为基地，把改造和服务结合起来，在积极服务中加强改造。我们两会的这次中、执委联席会议的精神是贯彻了党对工商业者和平改造的政策，是符合工商业者当前自我改造的实际情况的，在会议闭幕以后，我们湖北省武汉市在当地党委的领导下，对这次联席会议的文件和决议进行了传达，布置了学习和讨论，所有与会的工商业者都受到了很大的鼓舞和启发，极大多数人在不同程度上提高了思想认识，改变了过去厌倦改造的情绪，并且在生产劳动方面进一步有所表现。
    现在，周总理在“政府工作报告”中进一步指示我们要在参加社会主义建设的工作中继续进行自我教育和自我改造，这使我们对于改造和服务相结合，在积极服务中加强改造的重要性，更为明确起来，这对于推动和帮助我们加强改造、积极服务是一个最大的鼓舞力量。工商界中曾经有些人对于为什么要把改造和服务结合起来，是认识不足的，有的甚至认为改造和服务是矛盾的两种事。现在，我们进一步认识到改造和服务是不能分割的、相互促进的统一体。改造与服务的关系就是认识与实践的关系。认识是从实践中来，回过来又去指导实践。同样，我们的改造决不能离开服务，只有在服务实践中才能进行改造；而改造回过来又可以推进服务。所以，我们工商业者为了把自己由剥削者改变为劳动者，为了在社会主义建设中作出贡献，就必须在参加社会主义建设工作的实践中来进行自我改造。
    周总理号召我们说：“我们应当在全国的每一个角落，从思想上政治上动员每一个工人、农民、知识分子和每一个爱国的公民的积极性，立即开展一个增产节约的全民运动。”我们工商业者一定要热烈响应周总理的这个号召，从思想上政治上重视这个运动，更密切地团结在中国共产党的周围，在党的领导下，自觉地加强自我改造，为祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业作出更多、更好的贡献。在祖国的大团结、大跃进中，我们工商业者一定要和全国人民一起迈步前进。
