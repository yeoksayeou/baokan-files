Comrade Münnich Ferenc, esteemed Ambassador Nográdi, esteemed comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, comrades, friends:

　　The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, headed by Comrade Münnich Ferenc, is about to leave our country after a friendly visit. The delegation visited cities and villages in our country, toured factories, people's communes, and universities, and met with people from all walks of life in our country, receiving warm welcomes from the Chinese people everywhere. The Hungarian guests, along with many other guests from around the world, celebrated International Labor Day with the Chinese people, which made the Chinese people feel especially happy.

　　The Party and Government leaders of our two countries held sincere and cordial talks on international issues of mutual concern, the state of socialist construction in our two countries, and the further expansion of friendly cooperative relations between our two countries and two parties, and reached a complete consensus on these issues. Direct contact and mutual exchange of experience between the leaders of China and Hungary are very beneficial to promoting our common cause.

　　The people of China and Hungary both cherish the deep friendship we have established in our long common struggle. We are both determined to continue to consolidate and develop the friendly cooperative relations between China and Hungary, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism. To this end, our two governments signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic today. This is a new milestone in the development of Sino-Hungarian friendship and a major event worthy of celebration by the people of our two countries. There is no doubt that this treaty will further develop the comprehensive friendly cooperative relations between the people of our two countries, which will be very beneficial to the people of our two countries, to the entire socialist camp, and to world peace. We firmly believe that the work we have completed here will be welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.

　　The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation is about to conclude its visit to our country. Although the distinguished guests have only stayed in our country for a short time, this visit has left an indelible impression on the hearts of the Chinese people. The visit of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Münnich Ferenc will have a profound impact on the development of the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary and will be recorded as a glorious page in the history of Sino-Hungarian friendship. On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Government, I express my heartfelt thanks to Comrade Münnich Ferenc and all the comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation he led for their friendly visit to our country.

　　Comrades, friends, I propose a toast:

　　To the deep friendship between the people of China and Hungary,

　　To the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,

　　To world peace,

　　To the health of Comrade Münnich Ferenc and all the comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation,

　　To the health of Comrade Kádár, Comrade Dobi and other Hungarian Party and Government leaders,

　　Cheers!

　　周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的明尼赫·费伦茨同志，亲爱的诺格拉第大使同志，亲爱的匈牙利党政代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    以明尼赫·费伦茨同志为首的匈牙利党政代表团在我国进行了友好访问之后，即将离开我国了。代表团访问了我国的城市和农村，参观了工厂、人民公社和高等学校，会见了我国的各界人民，到处受到中国人民热情的欢迎。匈牙利贵宾们和来自世界各地的许多其他贵宾们同中国人民一起欢度了五一国际劳动节，这使中国人民感到特别高兴。
    我们两国的党政领导人就双方关心的国际问题、两国社会主义建设的情况以及进一步扩大两国和两党的友好合作关系问题进行了诚恳亲切的会谈，并且在这些问题上取得了完全一致的认识。中匈两国领导人之间的直接接触和互相交流经验，对于促进我们的共同事业是非常有益的。
    中匈两国人民都非常珍视我们在长期的共同斗争中建立起来的深厚友谊。我们双方决心继续巩固和发展中匈两国之间建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的友好合作关系。为了这个目的，我们两国政府在今天签订了中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国友好合作条约。这是中匈友谊发展的新的里程碑，是值得我们两国人民共同庆贺的大事。毫无疑问，这个条约必将使我们两国人民之间的全面的友好合作关系得到进一步的发展，这对于我们两国人民、对于整个社会主义阵营和世界和平都是十分有利的。我们深信，我们在这里完成的工作，将受到全世界爱好和平的人民的欢迎。
    匈牙利党政代表团就要结束在我国的访问了。虽然各位贵宾在我国逗留的时间很短，但是这次访问已经在中国人民的心里留下了不可磨灭的印象。以明尼赫·费伦茨同志为首的匈牙利党政代表团的访问将对中匈两国人民的兄弟友谊的发展产生深远的影响，将作为光辉的一页载入中匈友好的史册。我代表中国共产党和中国政府，对明尼赫·费伦茨同志和他率领的匈牙利党政代表团的全体同志们在我国的友好访问，表示衷心的感谢。
    同志们，朋友们，我提议：
    为中匈两国人民的深厚友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固和团结，
    为世界和平，
    为明尼赫·费伦茨同志和匈牙利党政代表团全体同志的健康，
    为卡达尔同志，道比同志和其他匈牙利党政领导同志的健康，
    干杯！
