    The Largest Bee
    On Hainan Island, our country's rich and beautiful treasure island in the south, there is a type of "row bee" that is the largest in the world and builds nests in rows on the branches of mountain forests.
    The body size of the row bee is generally two to three times larger than that of the Chinese bee, and about twice as large as that of the Italian bee. The flying ability of this bee is also much stronger than that of ordinary bees, and it can fly about fifteen to twenty li to collect honey. The row bee has a large colony size and can maintain strong colonies of tens of thousands of worker bees. The worker bees also have a high ability to collect nectar, and they also have a strong ability to secrete beeswax and build honeycomb. A row bee nest found in the wild can often yield more than one hundred jin of honey and three to five jin of beeswax.
    Can this wild row bee be domesticated and raised? The agricultural departments of Guangdong Province have conducted preliminary investigations and studies, and have learned that the Hainan row bee is not as fierce as the rumors say and can be approached. At present, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture has formed a row bee research team, and plans to use domestication and hybridization methods within one or two years to cultivate excellent bee breeds with strong productivity and high pollination ability.

    最大的蜜蜂
    在我国南方富饶的宝岛——海南岛上，出产一种世界上最大的、在山林树枝上筑巢成排的“排蜂。”
    排蜂的体形一般的比中国蜂大二至三倍，比意大利蜂也大一倍左右。这种蜂的飞翔能力也远比一般蜜蜂强，大约可飞出十五至二十里远的地方去采蜜。排蜂的群势很大，能维持几万只工蜂的强群。工蜂的采集花蜜能力也很高，加上分泌蜂蜡和造脾能力都强，在野外找到的一个排蜂巢，常常可采割一百多斤蜜和三——五斤蜂蜡。
    这种野生的排蜂能不能驯化饲养呢？广东省农业部门已进行了初步调查研究，并了解到海南的排蜂不像传说那样凶恶，是可以接近的。目前，广东省农业厅已组成排蜂研究小组，准备在一两年内，用驯化和杂交方法，培育出生产力强、授粉力高的优良蜂种。
