Holding planned urban and rural materials exchange meetings is a major task of socialist commercial work. Because the state owns a vast commercial organization, the production and distribution of more than 300 kinds of first and second-class materials, which are very important to the national economy and the people's livelihood, have been directly incorporated into the state plan and are centrally managed and allocated by the state. In addition to the above two categories of materials, there are thousands of agricultural and sideline native and special products and small commodities closely related to production and life, which are the third category of materials. These materials are diverse in variety and scattered in production, making it impossible for the state to manage and allocate them centrally. Therefore, how to organize the circulation of the third category of commodities in a planned way, promote the development of the production of these commodities, and meet the diverse needs of production and construction and the broad masses of the people as much as possible is an important issue that must be well resolved in the current economic life.

The recent National Third Category Materials Exchange Conference held by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Light Industry in Shanghai made an important start in this regard. Through this materials exchange conference, the situation of production and demand of the third category of materials has been further communicated, so that production and demand sides, regions, and urban and rural areas can better understand each other's situations, exchange what they have for what they need, restore the original reasonable supply and marketing relationships, and establish necessary new cooperative relationships, thereby making the circulation channels of the third category of commodities smoother and the distribution of commodities more reasonable. Through the materials exchange conference, many new resources were also discovered, thus expanding the sources of the third category of materials. At this materials exchange conference, provinces, cities, and autonomous regions signed contracts and agreements, with a transaction value of nearly 1 billion yuan for the third category of commodities. This will play a positive role in developing commodity production, supplying the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the broad masses of the people this year, activating the market, and stabilizing prices. At the same time, through the national materials exchange conference and the materials exchange conferences in various provinces, special districts, and counties, it is also easier for industrial and agricultural production and commercial departments to arrange production and supply work on the basis of communicating production and sales relationships. People's communes and production teams can uniformly arrange labor according to national and market needs, develop diversified commodity production in a planned way, and increase the income of commune members. Industrial and handicraft departments can also obtain more reliable guarantees in the supply of certain raw materials; the sales of products can also get a more stable market. Commercial departments can also organize the circulation of the third category of commodities in a more planned way to meet market demand for the third category of commodities. It is not difficult to see that holding materials exchange meetings is a good form of planned organization of commodity circulation under the socialist system.

Our country has a vast territory, and there are a large number of resources that can be utilized, whether in the south or north, mountains or plains, coastal or inland areas. Bamboo, wood, rattan, willow, grass, wheat straw, cotton stalk skin, corn cobs, and rice husks can all be used to make many daily necessities, and some are important industrial raw materials; various minerals and aquatic resources belonging to the third category of materials are also very abundant in our country; as for waste materials and scraps, every household has them, and after processing, they can become useful commodities. These resources are all favorable material conditions for developing the production of the third category of commodities. However, because the production of these materials is very scattered and piecemeal, it is easy to be squeezed out by other production tasks without a comprehensive arrangement. Therefore, Party committees and relevant business departments at all levels must pay sufficient attention to this work, include the development of the production of the third category of commodities in the work agenda, and plan and arrange it together with other production tasks in a unified manner. To this end, all localities should first hold materials exchange meetings at the provincial, special district, and especially county levels, and sign contracts and agreements at each level to combine the various purchase and sales tasks and corresponding production tasks arranged at this national materials exchange conference with the specific conditions of the local area, and deploy them down to the grassroots production units.

Extensively signing production and sales contracts is an important means of incorporating the production and exchange of the third category of materials into the national plan track, and it is also an important method to promote the implementation of the materials exchange plan. Therefore, all levels of materials exchange meetings should attach importance to contract signing work. By signing practical contracts, the production and exchange plans can be fixed. In order to ensure the complete realization of the contract, in addition to earnestly inspecting and supervising, all localities should also start from production and assist people's communes and factories to solve a series of problems in the production process such as technical equipment, raw materials, packaging materials, and short-distance transportation, so as to ensure the normal progress of production.

Technical cooperation and economic cooperation between regions, between urban and rural areas, and between departments play an important role in ensuring and promoting the realization of the production plan of the third category of materials, and should be greatly promoted. Because there are many varieties of third-category products, and the production technology level varies from place to place, the output, quality, and cost of the same type of product often vary greatly in different regions; some regions have poor technical conditions and technical levels, so even if they have abundant material resources, they cannot be fully utilized. Through the exchange of technology between regions and between departments, and the advanced helping the backward, common development can be achieved. Another situation is that certain third-category commodities, especially industrial raw materials such as minerals and bamboo and wood, are very abundant in resource-rich areas, but it is difficult for the resource-rich areas to develop them on their own. Through the support of the areas or departments that need the goods in terms of tools and equipment, production can be greatly advanced. This kind of economic cooperation can not only enable the production areas to develop rapidly, but also enable the areas that need the goods to obtain a reasonable supply.

The favorable situation of the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, as well as the experience gained in holding materials exchange meetings and promoting the contract system in various places, have created favorable conditions for developing the production of the third category of commodities. This national materials exchange conference has opened up a broad road for the circulation of the third category of commodities. It can be expected that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, with the widespread convening of materials exchange meetings at all levels, a new situation of unprecedented prosperity and prosperity will emerge in the production and exchange of the third category of commodities throughout the country.

    逐级开好物资交流会
    有计划地组织城乡物资交流，是社会主义商业工作的重大任务。由于国家拥有广大的商业组织，在城乡之间交流的物资中，关系国计民生十分重要的三百多种第一、二类物资的生产和分配都已经直接纳入国家计划，由国家集中管理与调拨。除了上述两类物资外，还有成千上万种和生产、生活关系密切的农副土特产品和小商品，也就是第三类物资。这类物资品种繁多、生产分散，不可能由国家集中管理与调拨。因此，如何有计划地组织第三类商品的流通，促进这类商品生产的发展，尽可能地满足生产建设和广大人民生活上多种多样的需要，这是当前经济生活中必须很好地解决的一个重要问题。
    最近商业部和轻工业部在上海召开的全国第三类物资交流大会，在这方面就做了一个重要的开端。通过这次物资交流会，进一步沟通了第三类物资生产和需要的情况，使产需之间、地区之间、城乡之间彼此更加了解情况，互通有无，恢复了原有的合理的供销关系，建立了必需建立的新协作关系，从而使第三类商品的流通渠道更加畅通了，商品分布更加合理了。通过物资交流会，还发现了不少新的资源，因而扩大了第三类物资的货源。在这次物资交流会上，各省、市、自治区通过签订合同和协议，成交了价值近十亿元的第三类商品。这对于发展商品生产，供应今年工农业生产和广大人民生活的需要，活跃市场和稳定物价，都将有积极的作用。同时，通过全国性的物资交流会和各省、专区、县的物资交流会，在沟通产销关系的基础上，也更便于工、农业生产和商业部门安排生产和供应工作。人民公社和生产队，可以根据国家和市场需要，统一安排劳动力，有计划发展多种经营的商品生产，增加社员收入。工业、手工业部门，在若干原料的供应上，也可以取得更为可靠的保证；产品的销售也可以得到更加稳定的市场。商业部门也可以更有计划地组织第三类商品的流通，以满足市场对第三类商品的需求。这就不难看出，举办物资交流会，是社会主义制度下有计划地组织商品流通的一种良好的形式。
    我们国家土地辽阔，不论南方或北方、山区或平原、沿海或内地，都有可以利用的大量资源。竹、木、藤、柳、草、麦秸、棉秆皮、玉米芯、稻谷糠，这些东西都可用来做成许多生活用品，有的还是重要的工业原料；属于第三类物资的各种矿石、各种水产资源在我国也很丰富；至于废料、废品更是家家户户都有的东西，经过加工处理以后，就可以成为有用的商品。这些资源，都是发展第三类商品生产的有利的物质条件。但是，由于这些物资的生产都很分散、零星，如果没有一个全面的安排，就很容易被其它生产任务挤掉。因此，各级党委和有关业务部门对这项工作必须予以足够的重视，把发展第三类商品的生产列入工作日程，和其它各项生产工作一起通盘筹划，统一安排。为此，各地首先应该逐级召开省、专区、特别是县的物资交流会，逐级签订合同与协议，把这一次全国物资交流会上安排的各种购销任务和相应的生产任务，结合当地的具体情况，布置下去，一直落实到基层生产单位。
    广泛地签订产销合同，是把第三类物资的生产和交换纳入国家计划轨道的重要手段，也是促使物资交流计划落实的重要方法。因此，各级物资交流会都应该重视签订合同工作。通过签订切合实际的合同，把生产和交换计划固定下来。为了保证合同的完满实现，各地除了认真检察督促以外，还应该从生产入手，协助人民公社和工厂解决生产过程中的技术设备、原材料、包装材料和短途运输等一系列问题，以保证生产的正常进行。
    地区之间、城乡之间、部门之间的技术协作和经济协作，对于保证和促进第三类物资生产计划的实现，起着重要的作用，应该大大提倡。由于第三类产品品种繁多，各地生产技术水平又不一致，同一类产品在不同地区，其产量、质量和成本往往有很大的差别；有些地区由于生产的技术条件和技术水平很差，虽有丰富的物质资源，也不能得到充分的利用。通过地区之间、部门之间交流技术，先进帮助落后，就可以求得共同的发展。另一种情况是，某些第三类商品，特别是矿产、竹木等工业原料，在产区资源十分丰富，单靠产区自己开发有困难。通过要货地区或部门在工具、器材等方面的支援，生产就可以大大跃进。这种经济协作，既可使产区生产得以迅速发展，也可使要货地区得到合理的供应。
    当前工农业生产大跃进的有利形势，以及各地在召开物资交流会和推广合同制方面取得的经验，都为发展第三类商品生产创造了有利条件。这次全国性的物资交流大会更为第三类商品的流通开辟了一条广阔的道路。可以预期，在各级党委的领导下，随着各级物资交流会的广泛召开，第三类商品的生产和交换在全国范围内将会出现一个空前繁荣兴旺的新局面。
