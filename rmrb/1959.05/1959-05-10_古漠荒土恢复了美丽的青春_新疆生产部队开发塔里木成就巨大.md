The vast wasteland that has been sleeping in the upper and lower reaches of the Tarim River basin in southern Xinjiang for ages has now been awakened by tens of thousands of soldiers and workers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Agricultural First Division and Agricultural Second Division. The desert wasteland, once called barren land by the people, has now been transformed into a new world of crisscrossing canals, continuous stretches of farmland, herds of cattle and sheep, and smooth roads.

The Tarim River basin is a good place in western China with a large land area and good natural conditions, suitable for growing grain, cotton, oil crops, and developing various livestock. According to several surveys conducted here by scientific workers, the Tarim River basin not only has 20 million mu of arable land, vast grazing pastures, and abundant water resources, but also has very rich oil reserves.

In order to force the vast wasteland of the Tarim River basin to grow huge amounts of grain, cotton, and oil as soon as possible, the soldiers and workers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Agricultural Second Division and Agricultural First Division, starting from the summer of 1956 and the winter of 1957 respectively, entered the Tarim area from Yuli and Aksu to fight against nature. When the soldiers and workers first arrived here, they encountered many serious difficulties in both development work and life. For example, in the hot summer, people had no water to drink; in the cold winter, people had no houses to live in; and food could not be supplied in time due to difficult transportation. However, the soldiers and workers were not intimidated by the difficulties. On the contrary, everyone was full of energy and overcame various difficulties to gain a foothold in the Tarim area. Since last year, under the influence of the nationwide Great Leap Forward and with the large increase of personnel and equipment in the Agricultural First and Second Divisions in the Tarim area, the enthusiasm of the soldiers and workers to develop Tarim has become even greater.

Now, the development and construction work in the Tarim area has made satisfactory achievements in all aspects.

In terms of water conservancy construction, the Agricultural First and Second Divisions have carried out huge earthwork projects in the upper and lower reaches in the past year, and built tens of thousands of canals, so that the wasteland that has been arid for thousands of years has been saturated with the water of the Tarim River for the first time. Among the large number of canals they built, there are five main canals, which are unprecedented in southern Xinjiang in terms of engineering volume and difficulty. The width and flow of these canals are so large that ships can navigate them. The Nan'an Main Canal, built by the farms of the Agricultural First Division in the upper reaches of the Tarim River, is 146 li long with a flow of 40 cubic meters per second, and a 60 li section of it can be navigated by ships. In order to ensure that the more than 200,000 mu of farmland of several farms and people's communes in the downstream area are not threatened by drought during the dry season of the Tarim River, the farms of the Agricultural Second Division also built two large reservoirs using depressions and lakes between Qunke and Tieganli in Yuli County. They have made outstanding achievements in overcoming shifting sand, ensuring project quality, and improving work efficiency in water conservancy construction. For example, when several farms of the Agricultural Second Division were building the Kala Main Canal, the shifting sand caused trouble. The canal dug one day was always filled by the shifting sand the next day, which brought serious difficulties to the progress of the project and the guarantee of quality. However, the soldiers and workers overcame the difficulties and controlled the shifting sand. They adopted the methods of "digging and protecting at the same time" and "wrapping sand with soil" to solve the problem of shifting sand.

In terms of land reclamation, the Agricultural First and Second Divisions reclaimed a total of one million mu of ancient wasteland in the Tarim area last year, and successively established 14 large-scale mechanized farms and one wild hemp farm, overfulfilling the plan for land reclamation and farm establishment. Now, including the farms established in 1957, there are 17 farms and one wild hemp farm in the Tarim area, and the reclaimed land has exceeded 1.2 million mu. Last winter, under the leadership of the Party Committees of the Agricultural First and Second Divisions of the Communist Party of China, the land reclamation of these ten farms turned into a mass movement with great momentum. At the same time, they organized a large-scale land reclamation competition. After the official start of this competition, the entire Tarim area was boiling. After a month of hard work, the farms reclaimed 600,000 mu of wasteland, with an average of nearly 20,000 mu of wasteland reclaimed every day. During this competition, a large number of activists and advanced figures emerged from the farms. For example, the Communist Youth League Farm of the Agricultural Second Division had a total of 1,196 soldiers, workers, and cadres, and 243 of them were selected as advanced producers and advanced workers at the end of the year. These advanced figures have made outstanding achievements in land reclamation. Jie Shuxin, a worker at the Shengli 16th Farm of the Agricultural First Division, leveled an average of 259 mu of land per day, creating the highest record for land leveling.

Under the guidance of the policy of "building farms, reclaiming land, and producing at the same time," some farms of the Agricultural First and Second Divisions, which started land reclamation earlier last year, also sowed a small amount of grain, cotton, oil crops, melons, and vegetables on the newly reclaimed land, and achieved satisfactory harvests. The several farms of the Agricultural First Division alone harvested 23.25 million jin of grain, cotton, melons, and vegetables. The good growth and high yield of some crops exceeded people's expectations. The 200 mu of cabbage sown by tractors at the Shengli 15th Farm yielded 8 million jin in autumn, and the largest cabbage weighed 28 jin. Some farms also grew radishes that weighed up to 12 jin. These products not only solved some of the difficulties of the farms at that time, but also strongly proved that the Tarim area is a good place suitable for growing various crops.

The farms of the Agricultural First and Second Divisions also attached great importance to the development of animal husbandry last year. In order to establish their own herds as soon as possible, some farms sent people to the north of the Tianshan Mountains to drive sheep, cattle, and horse herds, and specially established production organizations for animal husbandry teams. Now, there are more than 20,000 various livestock grazing on the Tarim wilderness.

The farms of the Agricultural First and Second Divisions have established a number of small processing plants and individual large-scale tractor repair plants, and vigorously carried out construction work in roads, bridges, communication lines, and housing. In terms of road and bridge construction, some farms of the Agricultural First Division first built the road from Aksu to Aral, and for the first time built a 325-meter-long and 7.5-meter-wide Tarim River Bridge on the wide Tarim River. The completion of this road and bridge has fundamentally changed the inconvenient transportation on both the north and south banks of the upper reaches of the Tarim River, especially for the development of the vast land and virgin forests on the south bank of the Tarim River. The farms of the Agricultural Second Division renovated the road from Yuli to Tieganli, which had been in disrepair for a long time, improving the previously difficult traffic conditions. The communication line construction work has also progressed very rapidly. At present, whether in the upper or lower reaches of the Tarim River, wired telephones have been installed between the farms and within the farms. It is also very convenient to make long-distance calls to relatives in Urumqi, Beijing, or other places. The farms also built a lot of houses last year. According to incomplete statistics, the newly built bungalows and buildings in the Tarim area now have an area of more than 140,000 square meters. In addition to some of these houses being used as seed warehouses, machinery warehouses, grain warehouses, greenhouses, and processing plants, most of them are offices, canteens, hospitals, nurseries, schools, clubs, shops, and staff dormitories. In some places where wood is scarce and reeds are abundant, people have also built a kind of cave-style house that only uses earth blocks and reeds, without wood. This kind of house is not only low in cost, but also achieves people's original ideas in terms of use, beauty, and solidity. The emergence of this kind of house has opened up new avenues for saving wood for the construction of a large number of houses in the Tarim area in the future.

Now, in order to sow the vast majority of the land reclaimed last year with seeds for a bumper harvest as soon as possible, the farms in the Tarim area are launching a mass movement with spring sowing as the center. They are striving to complete the sowing of hundreds of thousands of mu of grain, cotton, and oil crops before mid-May, so as to continue land reclamation and various construction works, so that Tarim will soon become a high-yield grain and cotton base of the motherland.

　　古漠荒土恢复了美丽的青春
    新疆生产部队开发塔里木成就巨大
    本报讯　亘古以来就沉睡在新疆南部塔里木河流域上下游的广大荒地，现在已被中国人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团农业第一师和农业第二师的数万名战士和职工们叫醒来了。从前那些一向被人民称为不毛之地的沙漠荒土，现在也都变为渠道纵横、农田连片、牛羊成群和公路畅通的新天地了。
    塔里木河流域，是我国西部地区的一个土地面积很大，自然条件较好，适宜于种植粮食、棉花、油料等作物和发展各种牲畜的好地方。根据科学工作者在这里进行的多次调查证明，塔里木河流域不仅拥有两千万亩可开垦的土地，广阔的放牧草场，丰富的水利资源，而且石油的蕴藏量也十分丰富。
    中国人民解放军新疆生产建设兵团农业第二师和农业第一师的战士和职工们，为了迫使塔里木河流域的广大荒地早日生长出巨量的粮食、棉花和油料，他们从1956年的夏天和1957年的冬天起，就分别由尉犁和阿克苏进入塔里木地区，同大自然展开了搏斗。当战士和职工初来到这里的时候，不论是开发工作和生活方面，都遇到了许多严重的困难。如在酷热的夏天，人们没有水喝；在严寒的冬天，人们没有屋住，以及由于交通艰难而发生的粮食不能及时供应等等。但是战士和职工们并没有被困难吓倒，相反地大家干劲冲天，克服了各种困难，在塔里木地区站住了脚跟。去年以来，在全国大跃进声势的影响下和农一师与农二师对塔里木地区人员、设备大量增加的情况下，战士和职工开发塔里木的劲头也就益发大了。
    现在，塔里木地区的开发工作和建设工作，不论那一方面都做出了令人满意的成绩。
    在水利建设方面，一年来农一师和农二师在上下游地区，都进行了巨大的挖方工程，修建了成千上万条的渠道，使干旱了千百年的荒原，第一次喝饱了塔里木的河水。他们修建的大批渠道中，有五条总干渠，就工程量和工程的艰巨性说，都是新疆南部地区过去所没有的。这几条渠道之宽和流量之大，简直可以行驶船只。农一师各农场在塔里木河上游修建的长达一百四十六华里、流量为四十个秒立方的南岸总干渠，就有六十华里的一段可以行驶船只。为了保证下游地区几个农场和人民公社的二十多万亩农田在塔里木河枯水期不受干旱的威胁，农二师的各农场在尉犁县的群克和铁干里之间，还利用洼地和湖泊修建了两个较大的水库。他们在进行水利建设中，在克服流沙移动、保证工程质量、提高工作效率等方面成绩很突出。如农二师的几个农场在修建卡拉总干渠时，因为流沙作怪，开始总是头一天挖的渠道，第二天就被流沙填了，这对工程的进展和质量的保证，都带来了严重困难。但战士和职工们克服了困难，制服了流沙移动。他们采取了“一边挖、一边护”和“土包沙”的办法，解决了流沙的移动问题。
    开荒造田方面，农一师和农二师去年在塔里木地区，共开垦了一百万亩古老荒地，先后建立了十四个大型的机械化农场和一个野麻农场，超额地完成了开荒造田和建立农场的计划。现在，塔里木地区连同1957年建立的农场，已有十七个农场和一个野麻农场了；开垦出的土地，已有一百二十多万亩。去年冬季，这里的十多个农场在中共农一师和农二师党委的领导下，把开荒造田也变成了一个声势浩大的群众运动。他们在同一的时间里，组织了一次规模很大的开荒造田大竞赛。这个竞赛正式开始之后，塔里木地区就整个沸腾了起来。各农场经过一个月的苦战，就开垦出六十万亩荒地，每天开出的荒地亩数，平均将近两万。各农场在这次大竞赛中，涌现出大批积极分子和先进人物。如农二师的共青团农场，全场的战士、职工和干部共有一千一百九十六人，而年终被评选为先进生产者和先进工作者的就有二百四十三人之多。这些先进人物在开荒造田中都有着自己出色的成绩。农一师的胜利十六场职工解述新，平整的土地亩数，每天平均达到了二百五十九亩，创造了平整土地的最高纪录。
    农一师和农二师去年开荒造田较早的一些农场，在“边建场、边开荒、边生产”的方针指导下，他们在新开垦的土地上，还播种了少量的粮食、棉花、油料和瓜菜等作物，并获得了令人满意的收获。仅农一师的几个农场，就收获了粮食、棉花、瓜菜二千三百二十五万斤。有些作物生长情况的良好和产量之高，超出了人们的预料。胜利十五场用拖拉机播种的二百亩包心菜，到秋天就收获了八百万斤，最大的一棵白菜，重量竟达到二十八斤；有些农场种的萝卜，也有长到十二斤重的。这些产品不但解决了农场当时的一些困难，而且有力地证明了塔里木地区是个适合于种植各种农作物的好地方。
    农一师和农二师的各农场，去年对畜牧业的发展也很重视。有些农场为了早日建立起自己的畜群，曾派人到天山以北赶来了羊群、牛群和马群，并专门建立了畜牧队的生产组织。现在，塔里木的原野上，已有两万几千头各种牲畜在放牧着。
    农一师和农二师的各个农场，已建立了一批小型加工厂和个别规模较大的拖拉机修配场，并大力进行公路、桥梁、通讯架设和房屋建设等方面的建设工作。在公路和桥梁建设方面，农一师的一些农场，首先修通了从阿克苏到阿拉尔的公路，并在宽阔的塔里木河上，第一次修筑了一座三百二十五公尺长和七点五公尺宽的塔里木河大桥。这条公路和大桥的建成，使塔里木河上游地区南北两岸的交通不便的面貌有了根本改变，尤其对开发塔里木河南岸的广大土地和原始森林有着很大意义。农二师的各农场，整修了在长时间失修的尉犁到铁干里的公路，使以前难以行车的状况有了好转。通讯架设工作进展也非常迅速，目前不论是塔里木河上游或下游地区，各农场之间和各农场的内部，都架设了有线电话。就是要和在乌鲁木齐、北京或其他地方的亲人通长途电话，也很方便。各农场在去年还修筑了不少的房屋，据不完全统计，现在塔里木地区新建起来的各种平房、楼房面积已有十四万多平方公尺了。这些房屋除了部分作了种籽仓库、机具库房、粮食仓库、温室和加工厂外，大部分都是办公室、食堂、医院、托儿所、学校、俱乐部、商店、职工宿舍。在一些缺乏木料而芦苇较多的地方，人们还修建了一种只用土块、芦苇、不用木料的窑洞式房屋，这种房屋不光是造价低，而且在使用、美观、坚固方面，都达到了人们原来的设想。这种房屋的出现，给塔里木地区今后建筑大量房屋节省木材开辟了新的途径。
    现在，塔里木地区各农场，为了把去年开垦出的绝大部分土地在最近都能播上丰收的种籽，大家正在开展一个声势浩大的以春播为中心的群众运动，他们争取在5月中旬以前，把数十万亩粮食、棉花、油料作物都能播种完，以便继续进行开荒造田和各项建设工作，使塔里木早日变为祖国的一个粮棉高产基地。（附图片）
