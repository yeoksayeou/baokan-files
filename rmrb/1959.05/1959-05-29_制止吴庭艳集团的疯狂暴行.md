Stop the Mad Atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem Clique
By Our Staff Commentator

While U.S. imperialism is instigating the Sananikone government to provoke a civil war and create tension in Laos, it is also instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to massacre peaceful residents and sabotage the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam even more unscrupulously. The peace of Indochina is facing a severe threat, which cannot but arouse the close attention of peace-loving people all over the world.

Since the restoration of peace in Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has consistently implemented the U.S. plot to undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. To this end, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has intensified its reign of terror in South Vietnam, carrying out a frantic persecution of the South Vietnamese people who actively participated in the anti-French war and strived for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics, by February of this year, the South Vietnamese regime had arrested and imprisoned more than 180,000 people, more than 10,000 people had been tortured and injured, and more than 4,000 people had been killed or declared missing. The Phu Loi massacre, which occurred in South Vietnam half a year ago, in which more than 1,000 Vietnamese patriots were poisoned to death, was an even more shocking fascist atrocity. Today, this newspaper publishes the speech made by Pham Binh, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, at a press conference, listing a large number of irrefutable facts, exposing to the world the bloody crimes of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in persecuting patriotic people in South Vietnam. From February of this year to the present, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has been conducting so-called "sweeping" operations against the peaceful residents of the former anti-French war base areas, namely the "D zone." The South Vietnamese authorities have dispatched tens of thousands of ground and air forces, using U.S. guns and aircraft to carry out frantic massacres and persecutions of the people there. At the same time, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities also openly promulgated fascist decrees aimed at further persecuting former Vietnamese resistance personnel and South Vietnamese peaceful residents who support the Geneva Accords, namely the No. 10 Decree of 1959. This kind of fascist atrocity by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has aroused the boundless indignation of the people in both North and South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people, especially the South Vietnamese people, are waging a heroic struggle against the persecution of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in order to safeguard the Geneva Accords, strive for the reunification of the motherland, and their own right to survival.

The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate that both sides of the ceasefire in Vietnam "guarantee not to take any retaliatory or discriminatory action against any person or group because of their activities during the war and guarantee their democratic freedoms." The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's imprisonment and murder of former anti-French war personnel in South Vietnam, and its large-scale military "sweeping" operations against the peaceful people in the former anti-French war base areas, are direct violations and sabotages of the Geneva Accords. If this increasingly crazy atrocity of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is not stopped, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam will be impossible, and the peace on Vietnamese soil, which the Vietnamese people have exchanged for with their blood, will be completely destroyed.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's current intensified implementation of a reign of terror and persecution against the people of South Vietnam is being carried out under the direct planning of U.S. imperialism, and is part of the U.S. plot to undermine the peace of the entire Indochina. For a long time, the United States has wantonly trampled on the Geneva Accords, having transported weapons and war materials into South Vietnam 375 times. The number of U.S. military advisory groups in South Vietnam has expanded to 2,000, and they completely control the South Vietnamese army. In the military "sweeping" operations against patriotic people in South Vietnam, U.S. military personnel directly participated in the command. Recently, U.S. imperialism further instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the government of the Kingdom of Laos to collude, holding secret talks in Saigon and concluding many "agreements" in order to comprehensively undermine the peace of Indochina and completely tear up the Geneva Accords. As General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, solemnly pointed out in his memorandum to the International Commission for Vietnam on March 6 this year, the persecution and suppression atrocities of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam will not only further endanger the peace of Vietnam and deepen the crisis over the issue of national reunification, but will also inevitably threaten the peace and security of Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.

As a signatory to the Geneva Accords, the Chinese people have a lofty international obligation to safeguard the Geneva Accords and the peace of Indochina. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the bloody atrocities of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam. We believe that the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam should immediately take effective measures to stop the South Vietnamese authorities' military "sweeping" of the "D zone" and all terrorist activities, and abolish the fascist decrees persecuting former anti-French war personnel, so as to guarantee the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords related to Vietnam.

    制止吴庭艳集团的疯狂暴行
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义策动萨纳尼空政府在老挝挑起内战、制造紧张局势的同时，唆使吴庭艳集团在南越更加肆无忌惮地屠杀南越和平居民、破坏日内瓦协议。印度支那和平遭受着严重的威胁，这不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的密切注意。
    从越南和平恢复以来，吴庭艳集团一贯地执行着美国破坏日内瓦协议和阻挠越南和平统一的阴谋。为了这个目的，吴庭艳集团日益加紧了它在南越的恐怖统治，对曾经积极参加抗法战争和努力为日内瓦协议在越南的全部实施而斗争的南越人民进行疯狂的迫害。据不完全的统计，到今年2月为止，南越政权已经拘捕和监禁了十八万余人，有一万余人被虐打成伤，四千余人被杀害和宣告下落不明。半年以前，在南越发生的毒死越南爱国者一千多人的富利惨案，更是震骇世界的法西斯暴行。今天本报发表的越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办范平在记者招待会上的讲话，列举了大量的无可置辩的事实，向全世界揭露了吴庭艳集团的迫害南越爱国人民的血腥罪行。从今年2月开始直到现在，吴庭艳集团对越南前抗战根据地即“D战区”的和平居民，进行着所谓“扫荡”战。南越当局竟出动了数以万计的陆空部队，用美国的枪炮和飞机对那里的人民进行着疯狂的屠杀和迫害。与此同时，吴庭艳当局还公然颁布了旨在进一步迫害越南前抗战人员及拥护日内瓦协议的南越和平居民的法西斯法令，即所谓五九年第十号法令。吴庭艳集团这种法西斯暴行，已经激起了越南北部和南部人民的无比的愤慨。越南人民，特别是南越人民，为了维护日内瓦协议，争取祖国重新统一，以及自身的生存权利，正对吴庭艳集团的迫害展开英勇的斗争。
    日内瓦协议明确地规定，越南的停战双方“保证不得对任何人和团体因其在战时的活动而加以任何报复与歧视，并保证他们的民主自由”。吴庭艳集团对南越前抗战人员进行监禁、谋杀，对前抗战根据地的和平人民进行大规模的军事“扫荡”，是对日内瓦协议的直接违反和破坏。如果吴庭艳集团的这种越来越疯狂的暴行不加制止，越南的和平统一就不可能实现，越南人民用鲜血换来的越南土地上的和平就会遭到彻底破坏。
    吴庭艳集团目前加紧对南越人民实行恐怖统治和迫害，是在美帝国主义直接策划下进行的，并且是美国破坏整个印度支那和平的阴谋的一部分。长期以来，美国就恣意践踏日内瓦协议，曾三百七十五次把武器和作战物资运入南越。美国在南越的军事顾问团的人数已扩大到了两千人，他们完全控制了南越军队。在对南越爱国人民进行军事“扫荡”的行动中，美国军事人员直接参加了指挥。最近，美帝国主义更唆使吴庭艳集团和老挝王国政府进行勾结，在西贡进行密谈，缔结了许多“协定”，以全面破坏印度支那和平，彻底撕毁日内瓦协议。正如越南人民军总司令武元甲大将在今年3月6日致越南国际委员会的备忘录中所严正指出的，吴庭艳集团在南越的迫害和镇压暴行不仅将进一步危及越南的和平和加深在国家统一问题上的危机，而且还势必威胁到印度支那和东南亚各国的和平与安全。
    作为日内瓦协议的签字国，中国人民对维护日内瓦协议和印度支那的和平，负有崇高的国际义务。中国人民坚决反对美国和吴庭艳集团在南越的血腥暴行。我们认为，越南国际监察和监督委员会应立即采取有效的措施，制止南越当局对“D战区”的军事“扫荡”和一切恐怖活动，废除迫害前抗战人员的法西斯法令，以保证有关越南的日内瓦协议的彻底实施。
