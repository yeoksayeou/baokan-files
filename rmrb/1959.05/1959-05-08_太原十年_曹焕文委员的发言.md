Comrades Chairman and Members,

I have listened to Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s report on the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan’s work report of the CPPCC Standing Committee. I fully agree with and support them and am willing to resolutely implement them.

Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "When we look back at the development of the past ten years, our hearts are filled with joy and confidence." From the Premier's report on the overall situation of the country, I think of Taiyuan City, one of the industrial bases. Taiyuan City was liberated on April 24, 1949, and now it is exactly its tenth anniversary. In these ten years, Taiyuan City has developed along with the national industrial and agricultural development, and it has also leaped forward by leaps and bounds along with the national industrial and agricultural leap forward, and has formed one of the most important comprehensive industrial bases. Now I would like to express some personal experiences on the industrial development of Taiyuan City in the past ten years.

Although the Taiyuan area is surrounded by mountains, it is rich in mineral resources. Among them, coal reserves are the largest, and the burial of primary coking coal is even more valuable resource for the country. The iron ore reserves are also considerable. Gypsum is a special product supplied to the whole country. Other limestone, pyrite, refractory clay, pottery clay, etc. are even more abundant resources, which is really convenient for establishing and developing industry. However, Taiyuan's industry originated in 1892, the eighteenth year of Guangxu. From this calculation, in the long period of fifty-seven years until the liberation of Taiyuan in 1949, only a little small-scale industry was developed, and most of it was controlled by bureaucratic capital. Therefore, productivity was greatly limited, production shrank, technology was backward, and the utilization rate of equipment and labor productivity were low. After eight years of plunder and destruction by Japanese invaders, it became even more incomplete. In addition, before fleeing, the bandit Yan Xishan only used and did not repair the machines, and finally turned them into a pile of junk. Only after Taiyuan was liberated on April 24, 1949, when the industry fell into the hands of the people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and after restoration and development, Taiyuan's industry made great strides and underwent a fundamental change. Why did it change? Because there is a superior socialist system, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Our country has been 'poor and blank' in terms of economy and culture for a long time. It is not because we lack human and natural resources, but because we lack a social system that can adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces. As everyone knows, our country has a large population, abundant resources, and good climatic conditions, which are extremely beneficial to the development of productive forces. However, the same population conditions and geographical conditions, not only in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, it was impossible to have any leap forward at all; even after liberation, before the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and individual agricultural handicrafts was implemented, and before revolutionary victories were achieved on the political and ideological fronts, it was also impossible for the great leap forward of the 1958 style to occur." What Premier Zhou said refers to the whole country, but it also conforms to the situation of our Taiyuan City, and it is even more in line with the facts of the industrial development and changes in Taiyuan. Now, from several major aspects, the industrial development of Taiyuan City in the past ten years is explained as follows:

I. First, let's talk about the total industrial output value of Taiyuan City.

Taiyuan was liberated in 1949. If the output value of 1949 is taken as 100, it increased to more than three times by 1952, and in 1957 it increased by more than two times compared with 1952, and increased by more than ten times compared with 1949. In 1958, it increased by 85% compared with 1957, and increased by about 20 times compared with 1949.

II. From the perspective of major industrial products

(1) Pig iron: If the output of 1949 is taken as 100, the output increased more than seven times by 1952, and in 1957 it increased by 58.09% compared with 1952, and increased to more than eleven times the highest annual output before liberation. In the great leap forward in 1958, it increased by 42.2% compared with 1957. It increased by more than 18 times compared with 1949.

(2) Steel: If the output of 1949 is taken as 100, the output increased more than six times by 1952, and in 1957 it increased by 172.79% compared with 1952, and increased to more than twenty times the highest annual output before liberation. In the great leap forward in 1958, it increased by 87% compared with 1957. Compared with 1949, it increased by more than 38 times.

(3) Raw coal: If 1949 is taken as 100, the output increased more than two times by 1952, and in 1957 it increased by 94.72% compared with 1952, and increased more than ten times compared with before liberation. In the great leap forward in 1958, it increased by 76% compared with 1957. Compared with 1949, it increased by more than 19 times.

III. From the perspective of investment in basic construction

The state has paid a lot of funds for basic construction in restoring and developing industrial production in Taiyuan City. Since 1953, our country has started the first five-year plan for developing the national economy. Taiyuan is one of the key construction cities in the country, and it is also one of the industrial bases. Therefore, while the state is reconstructing and expanding the original factories and mines, it has built a number of new modern industrial enterprises. In the reconstruction, expansion, and new construction projects, the state has invested a large amount of construction funds according to needs, and it has increased year by year. The investment in 1953 increased more than twice compared with the restoration period in 1952, and in 1957 it was 5.85 times that of 1952. 1958 was a year of great leap forward, and the total amount of investment completed in basic construction in the city increased by 1.1 times compared with 1957.

IV. From the perspective of the increase in the number of factories

After liberation, the industrial development of Taiyuan can be basically divided into three periods, namely the restoration period, the construction period, and the leap forward period. Thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the efforts of the broad masses of workers, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, a series of major reforms have been carried out in terms of politics, economy, and enterprise management, so that everything old left over from the industrial aspect of the old society has been refreshed, and the ownership of the means of production has been gradually changed, paving the way for the great development of production. In just ten years, Taiyuan City has become a veritable industrial base. Taking the number of factories as an example, it increased more than twice in 1952 compared with 1949, and in 1957 it increased more than five times compared with before liberation. 1958 was a year of great leap forward, and there were even more emerging factories, many of which were modern medium-sized enterprises. The combination of these newly built and expanded backbone enterprises and a large number of small-scale industries supplemented and strengthened some shortcomings and weak links in industrial production, greatly increased production capacity, and made new changes in Taiyuan's industry.

Although Taiyuan's industry had a certain foundation before liberation, it was very weak. In the ten years after liberation, after restoration and construction to the great leap forward, in terms of iron and steel smelting, there has been a comprehensive iron and steel industrial system composed of different types of work such as coking, iron smelting, steel making, rolling, casting, forging, and refractory material manufacturing. In addition to the expansion of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the Gujiao Iron and Steel Plant has also been newly established, and a new iron and steel base has been opened up. The output of iron and steel will be greatly increased to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development. In terms of non-ferrous metals, electrolytic copper plants and electrolytic aluminum plants have been newly built. In terms of machinery manufacturing, there is a machinery manufacturing industry composed of various departments such as manufacturing metallurgy, lifting, drilling, motors, transformers, boilers, ball bearings, high-end lathes, agricultural machinery, and precision instruments. In terms of electric power, there is a modern equipment power industry system composed of the first to fifth power plants. In terms of the chemical industry, there is a chemical industry system composed of sulfur, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, phosphate fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, medicine, plastics, agriculture, and various light and heavy chemical production departments. In terms of coal, there is a highly mechanized coal mining industry. In addition, there are light industrial systems ranging from processing to finished product manufacturing such as textiles, wool weaving, knitting, printing and dyeing, printing, papermaking, cigarette rolling, flour, rubber, leather, glass, enamel, and food. These different industrial systems are not only equipped with new technologies, but also have a complete industrial system with close links between industries. The products of these industries will play an increasingly great role in supporting national industry and agriculture as well as people's daily necessities.

In short, Taiyuan's industrial and mining enterprises are constantly growing and becoming stronger, thriving, and growing day by day. On the east and west sides of the Fen River, and in the north and south of the urban area, there are many industrial areas, densely planted factory buildings, and rows of chimneys, forming a beautiful and spectacular picture, making it the most lovely city. When we look back at the industrial development of Taiyuan City in the past ten years, we feel infinite joy and firm belief in our hearts. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, we will use the active actions of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland – the People's Republic of China.

### 太原十年  曹焕文委员的发言

专栏：

　　太原十年
　　曹焕文委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理的关于一九五九年度国民经济计划的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告，以及政协李维汉副主席的常务委员会工作报告。我完全同意和拥护，并愿坚决贯彻执行。
    周总理报告中指示：“当我们回顾十年来的发展的时候，我们大家的心里都充满了愉快和信心”，由总理对国家整体的报告，联想到工业基地之一的太原市，太原市于一九四九年四月二十四日解放，到现在恰为十周年，在这十年的时间内，太原市随着全国工农业的发展而有了发展，随着全国工农业的跃进而也突飞猛进地跃进，已经形成为一个最重要的综合性的工业基地。现仅就太原市十年来工业发展的情况，发表一点个人的体会。
    太原地区虽然山岭重叠，但是矿产丰富，其中煤的蕴藏量最大，而主焦煤的埋藏多，更为全国的宝贵资源。铁矿的埋藏量也不少，石膏为供给全国的特产，其他石灰石、硫铁矿，耐火粘土、陶土等更是丰富的资源，对于建立发展工业实有其便利的条件。但是太原的工业，创始于一八九二年即光绪十八年，最初为火柴局。由此算起，到太原解放的一九四九年，整整五十七年的长时间内，只发展起一点点小型工业，而且绝大部分为官僚资本所控制，因此生产力受到极大的限制，生产萎缩不前，技术落后，设备利用率和劳动生产率低下。中间又经日寇八年的掠夺和摧残，更趋残缺不全。加之阎匪锡山临逃前，对机器只用不修，最后变成了一个破烂摊子。只有于一九四九年四月二十四日太原解放后，工业落到人民手中，在中国共产党的领导下，经过恢复与发展，太原工业才是突飞猛进，起了一个根本变化。为什么起了变化，因为有了优越的社会主义制度，正如周总理报告中所指示的：“我国长时期以来在经济上和文化上‘一穷二白’。并不是因为我们缺乏人力和自然资源，而是因为缺乏一个能够适应生产力发展的需要的社会制度。大家知道，我国人口众多，资源丰富，气候条件良好，这些对于发展生产力都极为有利。但是，同样的人口条件和地理条件，不但在半殖民地半封建的旧中国，根本不可能有什么跃进；就是在解放以后，在资本主义工商业和个体农业手工业没有实行社会主义改造以前，在政治战线思想战线没有取得革命性的胜利以前，也不可能发生一九五八年式的大跃进。”周总理所说是指全国，但也符合于我们太原市的情况，更符合于太原工业发展变化的事实。现由几个主要方面，以说明太原市十年来工业的发展如下：
　　一、先由太原市的工业总产值来说
    太原解放是一九四九年，若以一九四九年的产值为一百，到一九五二年提高到三倍还多，一九五七年比一九五二年增长了二倍多，比一九四九年增长了十倍以上。一九五八年比一九五七年增长百分之八十五，比一九四九年增长约二十倍多。
　　二、由主要工业产品方面来说
    （一）生铁：若以一九四九年的产量为一百，到一九五二年产量增长七倍多，一九五七年比一九五二年增长百分之五十八点零九，比解放前最高年产量提高到十一倍多。到一九五八年大跃进，比一九五七年增长百分之四十二点二。比一九四九年增长约十八倍多。
    （二）钢：若以一九四九年的产量为一百，到一九五二年产量增长六倍还多，一九五七年比一九五二年增长百分之一百七十二点七九，比解放前最高年产量提高二十倍多。一九五八年大跃进，比一九五七年增长百分之八十七。若与一九四九年比，则增长三十八倍多。
    （三）元煤：若以一九四九年为一百，到一九五二年产量增长二倍多，一九五七年比一九五二年增长百分之九十四点七二，比解放前提高十倍多。一九五八年大跃进，比一九五七年增长百分之七十六。若与一九四九年比，提高十九倍多。
　　三、由基本建设投资来说
    国家在恢复和发展太原市工业生产方面，曾付出了大量的资金进行基本建设，从一九五三年起，我国开始了发展国民经济第一个五年计划，太原为国家重点建设城市之一，而且是工业基地之一，因此，国家在改建、扩建原有厂矿的同时，新建了若干新型的现代化工业企业，在改建、扩建、新建工程中，国家根据需要投入了大量建设资金，而且是逐年增多，一九五三年的投资比恢复时期一九五二年增加一倍还多，一九五七年为一九五二的五点八五倍。一九五八年为大跃进的一年，全市基本建设完成投资总额比一九五七年增长一点一倍。
　　四、由厂数的增加来说
    解放以后太原的工业发展情况，基本可分三个时期，即恢复时期、建设时期和跃进时期，由于中国共产党的领导，广大职工群众的努力，以及苏联的无私帮助，从政治上、经济上和企业管理等方面，都进行了一系列的重大改革，使旧社会在工业方面所遗留下来的一切陈旧东西得到了刷新，逐步改变了生产资料所有制，给生产大发展铺平了道路，仅仅十年的光景，太原市已经成为名副其实的工业基地。拿工厂数来说，一九五二年比一九四九年增加了二倍多，到一九五七年比解放前增多五倍还多。一九五八年为大跃进的一年，新兴的工厂更多，其中许多都是现代化的中型企业，这些新建、扩建的骨干企业和大批的小型工业结合起来，补充和增强了工业生产上的某些缺门和薄弱环节，大大增加了生产能力，使太原的工业又发生新的变化。
    太原市的工业，解放前虽有一定的基础，但是十分薄弱。解放后的十年来，经过恢复和建设以至于大跃进，在钢铁冶炼方面，已经有了炼焦、炼铁、炼钢、压延、铸造、锻造、耐火材料制造等不同工种组成的综合性钢铁工业系统。除太原钢铁公司扩建外，又新建立了古交钢铁厂，新辟了钢铁基地。钢铁的产品将要更大的增长，以供应工农业发展需要。在有色金属方面，新建了电解铜厂和电解铝厂。在机器制造方面，有制造冶金、起重、钻探、电机、变压器、锅炉、滚珠轴承、高级车床、农业机械、精密仪器等各种部门组成的机器制造业。在电力方面，有第一至第五发电厂组成的现代设备电力工业系统。在化学工业方面，有硫磺、硫酸、硝酸、盐酸、烧碱、磷肥、氮肥、医药、塑料、农业各种轻重化学生产部门组成的化学工业系统。在煤炭方面，有高度机械化采矿的煤矿工业。此外还有从加工到制造成品的纺织、毛织、针织、印染、印刷、造纸、卷烟、面粉、橡胶、皮革、玻璃、搪瓷、食品等轻工业系统。这些不同的产业系统、不仅是以新的技术装备起来的，而且产业与产业之间，有密切关联的完整的一个工业体系，这些工业的产品，将在支援全国工农业以及人民的日用生活品，日益起着伟大的作用。
    总之，太原的工矿企业，不断成长和壮大，欣欣向荣，日益滋长，在汾河东西，城区南北，有许多的工业区，密植的厂房，林立的烟囱，构成了一幅美丽壮观的图景，成为一个最可爱的城市。当我们回顾了十年来太原市工业发展的时候，心里有无限的愉快和坚定的信念。我们坚决在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线指导下，用完成和超额完成一九五九年计划的积极行动，来迎接我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国建立的十周年。
