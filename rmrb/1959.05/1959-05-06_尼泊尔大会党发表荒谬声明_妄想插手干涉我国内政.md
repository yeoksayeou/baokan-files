Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 4th: According to reports from the Indian Press Trust, the Working Committee of the Nepali Congress Party issued a statement on May 3rd regarding the Tibetan rebellion, which has already been quelled by the Chinese government, attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    This statement puts forward various proposals for resolving the Tibet issue. The statement says, "Firstly, conditions should be created so that Tibet can implement the autonomy granted by the agreement signed with China in 1951. Secondly, if disputes arise over whether Tibet truly enjoys autonomy, the Tibetan people must have the right to decide this issue themselves."

    The statement believes: "If this is also impossible, China should agree to allow several Bandung countries to mediate in order to resolve differences on the issue of internal autonomy in Tibet."

    The Working Committee of the Nepali Congress Party, fearing accusations of making various proposals on the internal affairs of other countries, tries hard to find a "basis" for intervening in the resolution of the Tibet issue. It says in the statement, "Some people believe that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and therefore, it should not be a matter of moral consideration for other Asian countries. This argument will only weaken the anti-imperialist voice." This statement believes that Tibet was sometimes an independent country in the past, and sometimes it was ruled by the Chinese. However, after World War II, Asia has entered a new era of awakening, and this historical background is not enough to determine the way to resolve the Tibet issue. The statement goes on to say that this situation makes the redefinition of relations between Asian countries inevitable, and the major powers in Asia "have a responsibility" to "help" establish this relationship.

    The statement indiscriminately says, "If China follows the traditions of 19th-century imperialists, then not only national freedom, but also world peace and welfare, as well as the great ideals of socialism and their moral foundations, will be damaged. Of course, if China attempts to establish and maintain its sovereignty over Tibet based on the old standards used by imperialists in the past, then this will be reactionary."

    尼泊尔大会党发表荒谬声明
    妄想插手干涉我国内政
    新华社新德里4日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，尼泊尔大会党工作委员会3日就已被中国政府平息的西藏叛乱问题发表一项声明，妄图插手干涉中国内政。
    这项声明对于解决西藏问题提出各种主张。声明说，“首先，应当创造条件，以便使西藏能够实行1951年同中国签订的协议所给予的自治权。其次，如果对西藏是否真正享有自治的问题发生争执的时候，西藏人必须有权自己决定这个问题”。
    声明认为：“如果这也不可能的话，中国应当同意让几个万隆国家进行调解，以便解决在西藏的内部自治问题上的分歧。”
    尼泊尔大会党工作委员会深恐自己对他国内政问题提出各种主张会受到指责，因此极力寻找插手解决西藏问题的“根据”。它在声明中说，“有人认为西藏问题是中国的内政，因而，它不应当是其他亚洲国家从道义上给予考虑的问题，这种主张只会削弱反帝国主义的声音”。这项声明认为，西藏过去有时曾经是一个独立国家，有时则受中国人的统治。但是在第二次世界大战后，亚洲已经进入了一个新的觉醒时代，这种历史背景就不足以决定解决西藏问题的办法。声明接着说，这种情况使得重新确定亚洲各国的关系成为不可避免的事，而亚洲的大国“有责任”来“帮助”建立这种关系。
    声明不分皂白地说，“如果中国因袭十九世纪帝国主义者的传统的话，那么，不但民族自由，而且世界和平与福利以及社会主义的伟大理想和它们的道德基础都将遭到损害。当然，如果中国企图根据帝国主义过去所用的旧标准来建立并维护它对西藏的主权，那么这就将是反动的”。
