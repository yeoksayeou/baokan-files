Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 17th: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company held a five-level cadre meeting from May 5th to 15th, during which it seriously examined the problems existing in product quality and engineering quality. This meeting achieved good results because it mobilized the masses and adopted a method combining internal and external meetings, inspecting, debating, acting, and establishing rules and regulations simultaneously.

The workers of the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 steelmaking plants were at the forefront of this quality inspection. During the company's five-level cadre meeting, the Party Committee of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant held an exhibition of defective and substandard products, organizing all the factory's workers to visit and participate in criticism and debate. Through debate, the specific reasons for the low quality were identified, and the production responsibility system for shift foremen, furnace masters, stokers, assistants, furnace workers, ingot casters, and other positions was further improved. At the same time, they also compiled unified technical operation guidelines based on the summary of advanced experience, established a technical supervision station, and implemented a technical supervision system combining full-time personnel and the masses. As a result, product quality rapidly improved, and the steel qualification rate reached 100 percent on the 14th and 15th. The qualification rate of steel in the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant was only about 92% from January to April, but the qualification rate of steel in the first half of May reached 98.42%. In order to further organize a high-quality, high-yield competition, the Party Committee of this plant is organizing relevant parties to conduct research on technical supervision, operating procedures, and production responsibility systems, and is preparing to organize a plant-wide technical debate starting on the 17th to solve several key issues in improving product quality.

Following closely behind the three steelmaking plants, quality inspections are also gradually being carried out in the rolling mill, ironmaking plant, coking plant, and refractory materials plant.

Now, according to the new requirements of improving product quality and achieving high output on the basis of high quality, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has decided to establish a company-wide technical supervision organization, and establish technical supervision stations in key units such as the ironmaking plant, rolling mill, refractory materials plant, and forging steel department, so as to combine with mass supervision to implement strict technical supervision over production and construction.

    太钢五级干部会议开得好
    广大职工参加质量大检查
    据新华社太原17日电　太原钢铁公司在5月5日到15日举行的公司五级干部会议上，认真检查了产品质量与工程质量存在的问题。这次会议由于发动了群众，采取了会内会外相结合的方法，边检查，边辩论，边行动，边建立规章制度，因此收到了很好的效果。
    炼钢一、二、三厂职工是这次质量大检查的前锋。第一炼钢厂党委会在公司五级干部会议期间，就举办了废品次品展览会，组织全厂职工进行参观和鸣放辩论。通过辩论找到了质量不高的具体原因，进一步健全了值班工长、炉长、司炉、助手、炉前工、铸锭工等岗位生产责任制。与此同时，他们又在总结先进经验的基础上编制了统一的技术操作要点，建立了技术监督站，实行了专职人员和群众相结合的技术监督制度。因此产品质量迅速提高，14日和15日钢的合格率均达到百分之百。第二炼钢厂1至4月份的钢的合格率只有92％左右，5月上半月钢的合格率则达到98.42％。为了进一步组织优质高产竞赛，这个厂的党委会正在组织有关方面围绕技术监督、操作规程、生产责任制等各个方面进行研究，准备从17日起组织全厂性的技术大辩论，解决提高产品质量中的几个关键问题。
    紧跟在三个炼钢厂之后，轧钢厂、炼铁厂、焦化厂、耐火材料厂的质量检查也正在逐步展开。
    现在，太原钢铁公司根据提高产品质量、在优质的基础上高产的新要求，已经决定建立全公司的技术监督机构，在炼铁厂、轧钢厂、耐火材料厂和锻钢部等重点单位，设立技术监督站，以便同群众性的监督结合起来对生产和建设实行严格的技术监督。
