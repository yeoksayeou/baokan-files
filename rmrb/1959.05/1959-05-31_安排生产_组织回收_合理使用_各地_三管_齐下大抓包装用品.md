Arranging Production, Organizing Recycling, Rational Utilization
Various Regions Simultaneously Grasp Packaging Supplies Through "Three Controls"

(Our dispatch) Commercial departments in various regions have recently been simultaneously focusing on the production, recycling, and rational use of packaging supplies, achieving significant results.

Since March of this year, when the Ministry of Commerce proposed the three major measures of actively arranging the production, recycling, and rational use of packaging supplies, fifteen provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Sichuan have designated special organizations and full-time personnel, and convened meetings to study and develop concrete measures, strengthening the organizational leadership of this work.

In arranging the production of packaging supplies, various regions have adopted the method of utilizing local materials and relying on their own efforts to actively organize production. In many places, commercial departments, while assisting people's communes in developing diversified economies, have systematically helped organize the production of commodity packaging materials, achieving good results. For example, the Tianjin Cultural Station has successively cooperated with nearby Jiaohe, Wuqing, Hexi and other people's communes to organize the production of 30,000 wooden boxes, 10,000 grass bags, and more than 40,000 reed baskets; the Municipal Pharmaceutical Station contacted the nearby Shengfang People's Commune and produced 20,000 reed baskets within ten days, and signed a contract for 60,000 reed baskets. The Hengshan County Commercial Bureau in Hunan Province mobilized the masses to break through three barriers: ideological barrier, raw materials barrier, and technical barrier, helping people's communes utilize more than 30 kinds of wild raw materials such as Vitex negundo,枳木条, willow branches, and kudzu vines to process hundreds of kinds of commodity packaging supplies such as baskets, bags, and ropes. The Provincial Department of Commerce held an on-site meeting in the Nanyue People's Commune in this county to promote the commune's production experience of using rice straw and cogon grass to make cardboard and using wild rattan, willow, and tree branches to weave baskets, which played a great role in promoting the production of packaging supplies.

Due to the strengthening of leadership at all levels, the work of recycling packaging supplies has now attracted widespread attention. For example, units such as the Tianjin First Commercial Bureau system and the Beijing Chaoyangmen Inner Market have included the organization of recycling packaging supplies as one of the main contents of the red banner competition, extensively mobilizing the masses to collect wherever they are available. The Tianjin Pharmaceutical Station organized packaging material recycling shock teams, "Ten Sisters Groups," etc., and in just ten days, recycled 330,000 various medicine bottles, strongly supporting the production and transfer of medicines from many pharmaceutical factories in Tianjin, including Dalu and Jinghai. Field staff of the pharmaceutical wholesale stores carry a sack when going out to contact business, negotiating business on the one hand and recycling medicine bottles on the other. According to typical surveys, the recycling rate has reached 80%. The Nankai District Waste Products Company in this city sold more than 880,000 bottles to industrial departments in March, allowing a large number of "waste packaging" to be reused. Some units also sign packaging recycling contracts when signing supply contracts with units requiring goods, so the varieties and quantities of recycled packaging supplies are constantly increasing.

Various regions have also taken various measures in the rational use of packaging supplies, saving many packaging supplies and creating many good experiences. For example, the grain and commercial departments in Tongxiang County, Zhejiang Province, implemented the method of storing grain without bags and storing grain in bulk to make grain storage sheds; storing oil in magnetic jars instead of large iron barrels, which can save more than 110,000 hemp bags and more than 600 large iron barrels, without damaging the grain and oil. The dye packaging of the Tianjin Chemical Station used to use solid board boxes, and the procurement and supply station suggested that they use sawdust shavings boards instead; some wooden barrels were changed to round barrels woven with willow branches. According to incomplete statistics, this unit saved more than 500 cubic meters of wood in the first quarter alone. In order to save the use of wood, the Shanghai Penglai Sawmill Board Box Factory used some wood and scraps to make crushed wood splint boxes. Originally, one cubic meter of logs could only make 72 board boxes, but now it can make 272. Using this kind of board box to transport cotton textiles, department stores and other commodities is both beautiful and strong. This kind of board box is being promoted in this industry.

At present, commercial departments in various regions are further strengthening the leadership of this work, vigorously promoting existing experiences, vigorously carrying out the conservation and substitution of packaging raw materials and rational use on the basis of facilitating the transfer, storage, and sales of commodities, and ensuring the quality of commodities, and reasonably adjusting the recycling prices of packaging materials, and constantly expanding the varieties and quantities of recycling.

### 安排生产　组织回收　合理使用  各地“三管”齐下大抓包装用品

    安排生产　组织回收　合理使用
    各地“三管”齐下大抓包装用品
    本报讯　各地商业部门最近三管齐下，大抓包装用品的生产、回收、合理使用，已收到显著效果。
    自从今年3月份，商业部提出积极安排包装用品的生产、回收、合理使用三大措施以来，北京、上海、河北、河南、陕西、山东、辽宁、吉林、湖北、湖南、浙江、安徽、福建、江西、四川等十五个省、市都指定了专门机构和专职人员，并召开了会议，研究出具体措施，加强了对这一工作的组织领导。
    在安排包装用品生产方面，各地都采取就地取材，自力更生的办法，积极组织生产。很多地方的商业部门在协助人民公社发展多种经济中，有计划地帮助组织商品包装材料的生产，已取得很好的成绩。如天津市文化站先后与附近交河、武清、河西等人民公社协作，组织生产了三万个木箱、一万条草袋、四万多个席篓；市医药站与附近胜芳人民公社联系，在十天内，生产了两万个席篓，并签定了六万个席篓的合同。湖南省衡山县商业局发动群众，突破三关：思想关、原材料关、技术关，帮助人民公社利用黄荆条、枳木条、柳条、葛藤等三十多种野生原料，加工成上百种筐篓、袋、绳等商品包装用品。省商业厅曾在这个县的南岳人民公社召开现场会议，推广这个社利用稻草、茅草制造版纸和利用野生藤、柳、树条编制筐篓的生产经验，对解决包装用品的生产起了很大的推动作用。
    由于各级领导加强，包装用品的回收工作，目前已引起普遍重视。如天津市第一商业局系统、北京朝阳门内市场等单位，都把组织回收包装用品工作列为红旗竞赛主要内容之一，广泛发动群众，做到哪里有就到哪里去收。天津市医药站组织了包装材料回收突击队、十姐妹组等，只十天时间就回收各种药瓶子三十三万个，有力地支援了天津市大陆、静海等许多制药厂药品的生产和调运。医药批发商店外勤人员，外出联系业务时，都带一条麻袋，一面接洽业务，一面回收药瓶子，据典型调查，回收率已达80％。这个市的南开区废品公司，3月份出售给工业部门用的瓶子达八十八万多个，使大量的“废包装”又得以重新使用。有些单位在与要货单位签订供应合同时，也签定包装回收合同，因此包装用品的回收品种和数量都在不断增加。
    各地在合理使用包装用品方面，也采取各种措施，节省了许多包装用品，创造出很多好的经验。如浙江省桐乡县粮食和商业部门在全县范围内，实行储粮不用袋，散存做粮囤；储油用磁缸，不用大铁桶的办法，可节省十一万多条麻袋、六百多个大铁桶，粮、油也不受损失。天津市化工站的染料包装，过去用实板箱，采购供应站建议他们改用锯末刨花板做；有些木桶，改用了柳条编的圆桶。据不完全统计，这个单位仅在第一季度就节约了木材五百多立方公尺。为了节约木材的使用，上海市蓬莱锯木板箱二厂，用部分木材和下脚料，制成碎木夹板箱，原来一立方公尺原木只能制七十二只板箱，现在能制二百七十二只。用这种板箱装运棉织、百货等商品，既美观又牢固。这种板箱，正在这个行业中推广。
    目前各地商业部门正在进一步加强对这一工作的领导，大力推广已有经验，在便于商品调运、储存、销售，保证商品质量的基础上，大力开展包装原材料的节约代用与合理使用，并合理调整包装材料的回收价格，不断地扩大回收的品种和数量。
