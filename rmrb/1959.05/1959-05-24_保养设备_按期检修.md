    Maintaining Equipment, Regular Overhaul

    At present, there is a very important issue facing all industrial and transportation departments that needs to be seriously, effectively, and quickly resolved. This is how to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, and to supplement the necessary spare parts and components for equipment maintenance in various factories, mines, and transportation enterprises. In mines and factories of metallurgy, machinery, power stations, coal, chemical industry, petroleum, railways, transportation, post and telecommunications, building materials and other departments, there is a rather common and serious problem of poor equipment maintenance and repair, and insufficient spare parts and components. Machine repair factories do not produce or produce very few spare parts and components. If this situation cannot be reversed quickly, it will seriously hinder the development of production.

    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the equipment utilization rate in industry and transportation has greatly improved, and the utilization efficiency of machinery and equipment has been maximized. This is the result of fully utilizing people's subjective initiative on the basis of realistic material and technical conditions. In the future, we must continue to exert our efforts and further improve the equipment utilization rate in order to strive for a continued Great Leap Forward in industry and transportation. However, the increase in equipment utilization rate has also raised some new issues for us: many equipment are running day and night, some are "tired," some are "sick" due to certain wear and tear, and some precision equipment have been damaged to some extent because new workers and apprentices do not master them well. All these situations require the responsible personnel of industrial, transportation departments and various enterprises to pay great attention to equipment maintenance and repair. However, this issue has not yet received the widespread attention it deserves. Some often emphasize busy production and relax equipment maintenance and repair; some have generally paid attention, but have not yet begun to seriously solve it. At the same time, during the Great Leap Forward, some factories that used to manufacture standard parts, accessories, and tools were converted into factories manufacturing equipment, reducing production or no longer producing standard parts, accessories, and tools. Many repair factories in various departments and repair workshops in many enterprises have also been upgraded and transferred to take on manufacturing tasks, no longer engaging in repair work. As for those factories that are still manufacturing standard parts, accessories, and tools, those factories and workshops that are still undertaking repair work, also find their production situations very abnormal because the relevant departments have not taken their needs into account as much as possible in the allocation of metal materials, or have transferred the materials allocated to them for the purpose of manufacturing equipment. These situations have also increased the difficulty of equipment maintenance and repair work in enterprises.

    In order to quickly change this situation, all industrial and transportation departments must immediately take resolute measures in two aspects: on the one hand, strengthen equipment maintenance and repair; on the other hand, ensure the supply of necessary spare parts and accessories.

    In enterprises, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair should emphasize both prevention and repair, with prevention as the main focus. In strengthening preventive work, the main thing is to strengthen technical management, regularly educate employees to cherish equipment, abide by operating procedures, and conduct regular inspections and repairs of equipment, and not postpone the repair period because of rushing tasks. In terms of repair, any equipment that is found to have problems during regular inspections, or equipment that has malfunctioned during operation even if it has not reached the scheduled repair time, must be repaired immediately and must not be delayed, otherwise small "illnesses" will become big "illnesses." At the same time, we must strengthen the technical education of new workers and apprentices, and patiently teach them how to use the equipment correctly. New workers and apprentices must pass a practical on-site operation exam before they can officially work on the machine tool.

    Ensuring the supply of necessary standard parts, accessories, and tools is a necessary condition for strengthening equipment maintenance and repair. Any factories that originally manufactured standard parts, accessories, and tools and have been transferred to take on the task of manufacturing machinery and equipment should be allowed to resume their original tasks. The task of manufacturing equipment they are undertaking, except for those that are not much and can be completed soon, can be transferred to other suitable factories to continue. All industrial, transportation departments and enterprise machine repair factories and machine repair workshops must truly take on the task of repairing machinery and equipment. If the task of manufacturing equipment they undertake conflicts with the machine repair task, they should obey the machine repair task. Some machine repair factories and machine repair workshops, in order to complete the machine repair task, find it difficult to continue to undertake the task of manufacturing equipment, they should be relieved of the task of manufacturing equipment, so that they can concentrate their efforts on producing the necessary spare parts, accessories and other necessary parts for equipment maintenance.

    In order to manufacture standard parts, accessories, tools, spare parts and other necessary parts, a certain quantity, certain specifications and quality of metal materials are required. The agencies responsible for material allocation must guarantee such materials, and when the production departments receive these materials, they must use them for their specific purposes and not transfer them to other uses.

    We suggest that all industrial and transportation departments, while preparing for the rainy season (all field operation departments have this problem) and the summer (especially those departments with high temperature and high-intensity work have this problem), conduct a comprehensive and detailed inspection of the reserve of spare parts and accessories in their subordinate enterprises, the production of maintenance factories, and the overall machine equipment maintenance situation. If problems are found, they should be solved seriously, effectively, and quickly.

    We believe that by taking the above-mentioned measures, equipment maintenance and repair in industry and transportation can be done better, the equipment utilization rate can be increased even higher, thereby more effectively guaranteeing the continued leap forward in production.

    保养设备  按期检修
    现在有一个十分重要的问题，摆在各个工业交通运输部门面前，需要认真地、有效地、迅速地予以解决。这就是如何加强设备的保养和检修，补充各个厂矿和交通运输企业进行设备维修所必需的备品、备件。在冶金、机械、电站、煤炭、化工、石油、铁路、交通、邮电、建筑材料等部门的矿山和工厂中，目前相当普遍地存在着设备的保养和维修不好，备品、备件不足，机修工厂不生产或者很少生产备品、备件的严重问题。这种情况如果不能迅速扭转，将会使生产的发展受到严重阻碍。
    从去年大跃进以来，工业和交通运输业的设备利用率都有了很大的提高，机器设备的利用效率发挥到最高度。这是在现实的物质技术条件的基础上充分发挥了人的主观能动性的结果。今后，我们要继续鼓足干劲，更进一步地提高设备的利用率，以争取工业和交通运输业的继续大跃进。但是，设备利用率的提高，也向我们提出了一些新的问题：许多设备昼夜不停地运转，有的“疲劳”了，有的因为受到一定的损耗而“病”了，也有一些精密的设备由于新工人和学徒掌握不好，遭到某些损坏。所有这种种情况，都要求工业、交通运输部门和各个企业的负责人员十分重视设备的保养和维修工作。但是，这个问题，现在还没有引起应有的普遍注意。有些常常强调生产繁忙，放松了对于设备的保养和维修工作；有些虽然一般引起了注意，但还没有着手认真地加以解决。同时，在大跃进中，有些过去制造标准件、配件和工具的工厂改为制造设备的工厂，减少生产或者不再生产标准件、配件和工具了；有许多部门的修理工厂和许多企业的修理车间，也升级转业，担任制造任务，不再从事修理工作了；至于那些还在制造标准件、配件和工具的工厂，那些还在担负修理工作的工厂和车间，也由于有关部门在金属材料的分配上没有尽可能地照顾它们的需要，或者把分配给它们的材料移作制造设备之用，使得生产状况很不正常。这些情况，也增加了企业的设备保养和维修工作的困难。
    为了迅速改变这种情况，所有工业和交通运输部门必须立即从两个方面采取坚决的措施，一方面是加强设备的保养和维修工作；另一方面是保证必要的备品、配件的供应。
    在企业里，加强设备的保养和维修工作，应当是预防和修理同时并重，而以预防为主。在加强预防工作方面，主要是加强技术管理，经常教育职工爱护设备，遵守操作规程，定期对设备进行检修，不能因为赶任务而推迟检修的期限。在修理方面，凡是在定期检修中发现问题的设备，或者虽然没有到预定的检修时间，而在运转中出了毛病的设备，都要立即进行修理，不能拖延，否则小“病”就会变成大“病”。同时，还要加强对新工人和学徒的技术教育，耐心地教给他们如何正确地使用设备。新工人和学徒一定要经过现场实际操作的考试，才可以正式上机床做活。
    保证必要的标准件、配件和工具的供应，是加强设备的保养和维修工作的一个必要的条件。凡是原来制造标准件、配件和工具的工厂，已经转业担任机器设备制造任务的，应当让它们重新负担原来的任务。它们所承担的制造设备的任务，除所剩不多，很快就可以完成的以外，其他的可以转给别的适当的工厂继续完成。所有工业、交通运输部门和企业的机修工厂、机修车间，都要把机器设备的维修任务，真正地担当起来。它们所担负的制造设备的任务，如果和机修任务发生矛盾，应当服从机修任务。有些机修工厂和机修车间，为了完成机修任务难于继续承担制造设备的任务的，应当解除它们制造设备的任务，使它们能够集中力量生产必需的备品、配件和其它必要的零件，以供设备维修之用。
    为了制造标准件、配件、工具、备品和其它必要的零件，需要一定数量、一定规格和质量的金属材料。对于这种材料，负责物资分配的机关要加以保证，各生产部门在收到此项材料的时候，要专料专用，不要移作他用。
    我们建议各工业、交通运输部门，在准备过雨季（野外作业部门都有这一问题）过夏（特别是在高温、高强度工作的部门都有这一问题）工作的同时，对所属企业的备品、配件保有量，维修工厂的生产，以及整个机器设备维修保养情况，进行一次普遍而细致的检查。发现问题，认真地、有效地、迅速地加以解决。
    我们相信，采取上面所说的各项措施，就可以使工业和交通运输业的设备保养和维修工作做得更好，使设备利用率提得更高，从而更加有效地保证实现生产的继续跃进。
