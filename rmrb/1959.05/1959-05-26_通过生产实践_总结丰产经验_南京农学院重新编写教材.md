Through Production Practice, Summarize Abundant Harvest Experiences
Nanjing Agricultural College Rewrites Textbooks

(Our report) Over the past seven to eight months, more than two thousand teachers and students from Nanjing Agricultural College, who were sent to the countryside of Jiangsu Province, have rewritten more than one hundred types of teaching materials for various departments and courses based on the principle of combining theory and practice in rural labor and teaching.

In their production practice, the teachers and students of Nanjing Agricultural College discovered that much of the content of the original professional textbooks lagged behind the reality of high-yield and abundant harvests. For example, "Wheat Cultivation," originally an important course, used old lecture notes that considered wheat a low-yield crop. When explaining its cultivation techniques, it stated that deep plowing should not exceed six inches, sowing should not exceed ten catties, no more fertilizer should be applied during the jointing stage, and the yield limit was several hundred catties. However, in the communes, they saw that the wheat fields cultivated by the commune members, with many measures and yield targets in their abundant harvest experiences, had exceeded the scope described in the old textbooks. The teachers and students summarized and improved the farmers' abundant harvest cultivation experience, combined the biological characteristics of wheat with the technical operating procedures, and used the wheat growing season and the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture as the framework, transforming the original three chapters into nine chapters, greatly enriching the content of the teaching material. In the past, the "Microbiology" course only dryly lectured on bacteria as a type of organism, and after finishing the lecture, students would look at microscopes, back and forth, which teachers and students alike found tedious. After participating in production in the commune, they discovered that actinomycetes played a significant role, and the commune used them to produce various antibiotics such as aureomycin and streptomycin. They also discovered that fungi were closely related to fertility and antibiotics, and that fungi were the main pathogenic bacteria of plant diseases. After analysis and research, the teachers and students reached some scientifically valuable conclusions. Based on these scientific research results, they divided "Microbiology" into two courses: "Agricultural Microbiology" and "Soil Microbiology." In "Agricultural Microbiology," they added two parts: actinomycetes and fungi, and the content was expanded from the original fifteen chapters to thirty-six chapters. In the past, biology teachers regarded the theory of genetic variation as a forbidden zone, fearing that they would not explain it well; in the commune, the teachers and students saw that the commune members were actually using the theory of genetic variation to cultivate improved varieties, thus understanding that scientific research should serve production. In terms of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, the teachers and students discovered in their actual work in the commune that traditional Chinese veterinary medicine had rich diagnostic and treatment experiences and theoretical systems. The teachers and students used scientific knowledge to sort out some of the treatment experiences of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine in the commune and combined them with modern Western veterinary medicine knowledge to compile a textbook on "Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine," which did not exist in the past. The characteristics of the new textbooks are generally that theory is linked to practice, including some of the latest achievements in production.

The textbook compilation work of Nanjing Agricultural College was carried out under the leadership of the Party committee, combined with teachers, students, and experienced farmers. In the process of compilation, they also received enthusiastic help from the local Party committees. When the teachers and students went to Siyang County, which won the provincial cotton championship, to collect data, the comrades of the county Party committee opened the file cabinet and took out a large amount of valuable material for them to study. Some local Party committees also organized forums with elderly farmers and local experts for them.

Now, many departments of Nanjing Agricultural College have begun to use the new textbooks for teaching, which is welcomed by the students.

### 通过生产实践  总结丰产经验  南京农学院重新编写教材

    通过生产实践  总结丰产经验
    南京农学院重新编写教材
    本报讯  南京农学院下放在江苏农村的两千多名师生，七、八个月来在农村劳动和教学中，根据理论和实践相结合的原则，重新编写了各系各课一百多种教材。
    南京农学院的师生们，在生产实践中发现，原来所采用的专业教材，有许多内容落后于高额丰产的实际。如“小麦栽培学”，本来是一门重要课程，但原来所用的旧讲义，认为小麦是低产作物，在阐述它的栽培技术时，是深翻不能深过六寸，播种不能超过十斤，拔节时不再施肥，产量的极限数百斤等等。但在公社里却看到社员们所种的麦田，丰产经验中的许多措施和产量指标已超过旧书本上所讲的范围。师生们总结提高了农民的丰产栽培经验，把小麦生物学特性和技术操作规程揉合起来，以小麦生长季节和农业“八字宪法”为纲，变原来的三章为九章，大大充实了教材内容。“微生物学”这门课，过去教师只干巴巴地照书本讲细菌一种生物，讲完了看显微镜，反来复去，教师讲和学生学都感到枯燥无味。到公社实际参加生产以后，发现放线菌的作用很大，公社用来制造金霉素、连霉素等多种抗生素。也发现了真菌与肥力、抗生素等有密切关系，真菌是植物病害的主要病源菌。师生们经过了分析、研究，得出了一些有科学价值的结论，根据这些科学研究成果，把“微生物学”分成了“农业微生物学”和“土壤微生物学”两门课。在“农业微生物学”里增加了放线菌和真菌两部分，内容也从原来的十五章扩充为三十六章。遗传变异学说，过去生物学教师视为禁区，怕讲不好；在公社里，师生们看到社员们实际在运用遗传变异学说培育良种，从而懂得了研究科学应为生产服务。在畜牧兽医方面，师生们在公社的实际工作中，发现了中兽医有着丰富的诊疗经验和理论体系，师生们在公社运用科学知识整理了中兽医的一些治疗经验，与现代西兽医知识结合起来，编写了“中兽医学”这门过去没有的教材。新教材的特点一般是理论联系实际，包括了生产上一些最新成就。
    南京农学院的教材编写工作，是在党委领导下，教师、学生、老农结合起来进行的。在编写过程中，又得到了当地党委的热忱帮助。当师生们到获得全省棉花冠军的泗阳县收集资料时，县委的同志打开档案柜，拿出了大量有价值的材料，供他们研究。有些地方党委还为他们组织老年农民、土专家座谈会。
    现在，南京农学院很多系已开始用新教材讲课，受到学生欢迎。
