The Superiority of Great Socialism
Speech by Member Li Pingxin

Chairman, fellow members:

Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" is a magnificent poem that truthfully reflects the historical changes and the great leap forward of the whole nation. It is also a major document that comprehensively summarizes the achievements and experiences in all aspects of 1958 and reveals the tasks and guidelines for future construction. It inspires 650 million people to march victoriously on the long road of socialism and strengthens everyone's confidence in tomorrow. The reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian respectively provided a clear overview of the victories that China has achieved on the economic and financial fronts and the even greater victories that are about to be achieved, allowing everyone to see the magnificent picture of the country's national economic construction this year through systematic explanations and huge figures, and to see the splendid blueprint for the rational allocation of financial, material, and human resources adapted to national economic construction. Everyone who loves the cause of the Party and the people cannot help but feel happy and inspired.

Our brilliant victories in nation-building over the past decade, especially the unprecedented achievements on all fronts since the implementation of the first five-year plan for developing the national economy in 1953, fully prove that socialism is the only correct path to guide our country towards prosperity and happiness. The magnificent situation of the all-round great leap forward that began last year with the implementation of the second five-year plan has even more prominently demonstrated the undeniable superiority and righteousness of the socialist system. Superiority means that this social economic form based on the public ownership of the means of production has the creativity to open up unlimited material and spiritual resources; righteousness means that this social economic form based on peaceful labor has the endless vitality to propagate the common happiness of mankind. Superiority and righteousness are mutually unified. We face the capitalist system with a high sense of superiority precisely because we are filled with a warm sense of justice, relying closely on the forces of light in the world; this sense of superiority and justice is nothing more than a reflection of the superiority and justice of socialism in our thoughts and emotions.

From Premier Zhou's report, we know that the output of many major industrial and agricultural products in our country last year increased by more than double compared with the previous year; this year, the planned output of various industrial and agricultural products centered on the four major indicators has greatly exceeded last year's output. The most noteworthy of these is the astonishing rate of increase in steel production. Steel production was 5.35 million tons in the previous year, and increased to 11.08 million tons last year, that is, it jumped more than doubled in one year on a fairly large production base, which is an increase of 5.73 million tons. This increase in output is very close to Japan's steel production of 5.8 million tons in 1937, the year it launched a full-scale war of aggression against our country. This year, China's steel production target is 18 million tons. Compared with last year's steel production, although it has not reached double, the planned increase in output is 6.92 million tons, which, in terms of absolute figures, is still much higher than last year's increase over the previous year, under the condition of ensuring high-quality standards. If we compare this year's planned steel production with the highest annual steel production of 920,000 tons before liberation, it will increase by nearly 20 times. If we examine it solely from the perspective of the rate of increase in output, and compare our country with our competitor, Britain, it took Britain about 32 years to increase steel production from more than 5 million tons to 11 million tons; it took Britain about 18 years to increase from 11 million tons to 18 million tons; while in our country, each took one year (this year's steel production target may be overfulfilled; if it is overfulfilled, the second comparison time should be shortened accordingly). Last year, the output of important industrial products such as coal, pig iron, cotton textiles, and sugar in our country has already exceeded that of Britain. It is believable that the day when steel production exceeds that of Britain is not far away.

Steel is the "key link" to promote the comprehensive expansion of the industrial production network, and it is not difficult to estimate the prospects for the increased production of general industrial products from the high-speed increase in steel production; the rapid growth of industry will inevitably promote the accelerated upsurge of agriculture and cultural education.

China's economic front is a part of the economic front of the entire socialist system, and the leaping development of industry and agriculture in our country means that the productivity of the entire socialist system has undergone a major new surge. This cannot but remind us of Khrushchev's report on the seven-year plan at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union more than two months ago. From that historic report, through eloquent figures, we not only saw that the industrial growth rate of the Soviet Union greatly exceeded that of the United States, but also saw that the industrial growth rate of the entire socialist system far exceeded that of the entire capitalist system. According to Khrushchev's report, and with reference to other economic data, it can be estimated that from 1939 to 1958, the total industrial production of socialist countries increased by eight and a half times in twenty years, while capitalist countries increased by less than double. From 1954 to 1958, the average annual growth rate of industrial production in the entire socialist system was 11 percent in five years, while in the entire capitalist system it was less than 3 percent.

Capitalist production once proved itself superior to feudalism with a huge growth rate, and now socialist production is proving itself superior to capitalism with a new huge growth rate. However, when comparing socialism with capitalism, we can not only affirm that the former has a significant superiority over the latter, but also assert that the former has a clear sense of justice that the latter does not have. The superiority and righteousness of socialism are not only reflected in the nature of the relations of production, but also in the nature of the productive forces.

As everyone knows, the law that the relations of production must adapt to the nature of the productive forces is a universal economic law that plays a role in all social economic forms. The nature of the productive forces can be understood as the sum of the material and social attributes of the productive forces. As a result of the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production, both cannot but be imprinted with the mark of history, that is to say, not only the sum of the relations of production is a historical category, but also the sum of the productive forces is a historical category; at a certain stage of social development, they all have unique historical properties that correspond to and contradict each other. The most active and most revolutionary productive forces objectively and constantly require breaking through the limitations of the relations of production. Unless the capitalist relations of production are forced to give way to the socialist relations of production, they will always play a negative role in resisting, oppressing and restricting the productive forces; the more it gets to the later stage, the more this negative role is strengthened, until it is completely resolved through social revolution. Under the socialist system, there are also contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production, but these contradictions do not have antagonistic characteristics, because the relations of production can be constantly in a systematic process of metabolism through conscious, timely, and peaceful adjustment activities, and constantly promote the development of the productive forces. Only socialist relations of production built on the basis of public ownership of the means of production have this performance that is completely different from capitalist relations of production. Not only that, the nature of socialist productive forces is also different from that of capitalism; this is primarily due to the fact that after the socialist revolution and socialist transformation, and after the shaping of collectivist production and life, the laborers in the socialist system and the nature of their labor have undergone fundamental changes. Since the laborers, as the main factor of socialist productive forces, are completely different from the laborers under the capitalist system in terms of social status, life outlook, and spiritual essence, then the socialist productive forces in other fields cannot but undergo corresponding qualitative changes.

In capitalist society, the laborers who produce material wealth do not have the means of production, while the capitalists and landlords who own the means of production do not labor; the combination of labor power and the means of production must be realized through market relations and exploitative relations. Capitalism socializes labor and production on a large scale, and the labor of the working class should be social labor; however, because the means of production and labor products are owned by the bourgeoisie, labor and labor conditions are separated, and production is carried out in countless scattered and fragmented small capitalist kingdoms, but the use of labor power has complete privacy and isolation. The social nature of labor can only be revealed through commodity exchange in the market. The basic contradiction of capitalist social economy - the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private nature of ownership - is largely manifested from beginning to end in the contradiction between social labor and private labor, and in the contradiction between the socialization of production labor and the privacy of labor use. Since the total amount of social labor is fragmented and divided by various capitalist kingdoms, and corresponds to the fragmented division of the total amount of social materialized labor, and since the use of living labor blindly obeys the capitalists and capitalist groups who compete and exclude each other, this inevitably exacerbates the conflict between the relative narrowness of capitalist relations of production and the high degree of socialization of production; as the main component of social productive forces, labor power is increasingly seriously damaged and wasted, becoming an incurable disease of capitalist society. This chronic disease can only be completely cured through socialist revolution and socialist transformation.

The bourgeoisie always likes to promote the freedom and equality of capitalist economic and political systems, but in a society where commodification covers everything and capital dominates everything, the so-called freedom and equality are nothing more than empty flower illusions that cover up the essence of exploitation and oppression of laborers through commodity exchange relations and capital legal relations. Under the capitalist system, the ruling class has the freedom to exploit the working people and destroy the forces of social progress, while the working people only have the freedom to starve and suffer; rich people talking about equality to the poor is no different from wolves talking about universal love to lambs. The fundamental nature of capitalist social economy and the main purpose of capitalist commodity production determine that the working people are in a state of being bound and harmed, and also determine that the entire social production labor has an increasingly serious compulsory and enslaving nature; this compulsory and enslaving nature presents an extremely sharp contradiction with the free form and equal illusion of labor power trading.

The bourgeois reactionary groups always want to follow capitalist principles and do their best to preserve all barbaric compulsory systems and enslavement systems, otherwise they will not be able to survive. Recently, imperialists and foreign reactionaries openly supported a small number of rebel bandits in Tibet, trying to open a hole in Tibet, destroy our country's sovereign unity and territorial integrity; overestimating their capabilities, they dreamed of using ice chips and mud balls to block the righteous torrent of socialism, peace, and democracy; dreaming of permanently preserving the most barbaric compulsory system and enslavement system in the capitalist world, and preserving the darkest serf system that serves imperialism. However, dreams can temporarily comfort the demons who have lost confidence in tomorrow, but they cannot help them stabilize their footing, because they are standing on the ice mountain of slavery that is increasingly collapsing.

Socialism and compulsory systems and enslavement systems that harm the working people are absolutely incompatible. This social system has opened up a vast and boundless new world for labor creativity and the happiness of laborers. Because under the socialist economic system, the right to social labor and the ownership of wealth (means of production and labor products) are completely unified, and the social nature of labor and public ownership of property are completely suitable; the purpose of production is not to pursue profits, but to continuously improve the welfare of all the people, and continuously promote social prosperity and civilization. This determines that the labor of the entire society has genuine freedom and consciousness, and this freedom and consciousness is also reflected in and extended to all political and social life.

Since the public ownership of the means of production and the total products of labor has become the basis of social economic relations, common social labor and public labor conditions are always combined into one, and production is carried out in a planned way according to the production needs and consumption needs of the entire society, so there is no contradiction between social labor and private labor; the labor power of the entire society is uniformly scheduled and uniformly distributed by the state or collective. Labor power does not have commodity attributes, and labor use does not have private attributes, so labor has direct sociality, and everyone directly labors for society and also for themselves; the labor results of each person directly belong to a part of the public wealth of society.

Socialism establishes and constantly consolidates the public ownership of the means of production, implements and constantly improves the system of common labor and distribution according to work, and creates conditions for gradually eliminating the differences between mental labor and physical labor and the differences between urban and rural areas, which realizes genuine equality between people. After entering communist society in the future, due to the disappearance of various differences and remnants of old-fashioned rights, the foundation of this equality will be further deepened and expanded.

The freedom and equality of socialism, when compared with the so-called freedom and equality of capitalism, are just like the comparison between the vast sea in the daytime and the dry well in the dark night; we have the right to praise the vastness of the sea and despise the filth of the dry well. The imperialists and their vassals, the foreign reactionaries, are trying to dig out the sludge from the dry well to cover up the torrent of the sea; even if they work so hard, they can only stir up a burst of bubbles that will disappear in an instant; all reactionary forces that violate the historical trend of justice will inevitably suffer the fate of bubbles themselves.

Socialism not only realizes the equal labor relations between people, but also realizes the relationship of subordination between human power and material power. Here, it is not past labor that dominates living labor, but living labor that dominates past labor; it is not laborers that are subordinate to the means of production, but the means of production that obey the laborers. The laborers become the true masters of production, and their labor is respected by society and receives meticulous protection from the state and society. Contrary to the absurd system in capitalist society where the more wealth is produced, the poorer the working people become, in socialist countries, the richer the total social product is, the higher the material and spiritual living standards of the working people become. Material production and social needs promote each other, and the interests of individual life and the interests of social development are unified with each other, which not only easily fosters the production interests of all laborers, but also easily improves their social awareness, and the combination of production interests and social awareness is the main driving force that stimulates the continuous growth of labor productivity.

There is no doubt that after the socialist revolution and socialist transformation, the nature of human labor has undergone fundamental changes. With the development of socialist production, this change is continuing to expand and deepen, which will inevitably continuously release the enormous energy hidden in social labor, and thus inevitably push the entire social productive forces forward by leaps and bounds without stopping.

The new nature of labor on the basis of socialist relations of production determines the nature and speed of the development of productive forces, and also strengthens the superiority and righteousness of the socialist system. We believe that the leaping development of our country's productive forces is not only sufficient to guarantee the victorious completion and overfulfillment of the tasks on the economic and cultural fronts in 1959, but also, on the basis of the superiority and righteousness of the entire socialist system, sufficient to guarantee that our country will become a prosperous and happy country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in the not-too-distant future.

When we are victoriously advancing on the socialist road, we cannot but think of our Tibetan brothers who are about to begin to get rid of the serf system and enter a new historical period. As everyone knows, the feudal serf system in Tibet is absolutely incompatible with the socialist system and the people's democratic system of the motherland. There, the vast number of farmers and herdsmen live a bitter and miserable inhuman life under the cruel exploitation and harsh oppression of the serf owners. The mortality rate and escape rate are very high, which has resulted in the destruction of Tibet's social productive forces and has seriously hindered the development of Tibet's social economy and culture. In order to preserve this dark feudal enslavement system, the reactionary group in the upper strata of Tibet has been obstructing the implementation of social reforms; and they have frantically colluded with imperialists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, attempting to rely on their strength to split the motherland, restore the colonialist forces of foreign aggressors in Tibet, and allow the serf owners to forever trample on the flesh and souls of the Tibetan working people and live a lewd and shameless rotten life. Now they have embarked on the road of self-destruction from the people of the whole country and have received the punishment they deserve! No force can stop the social reform movement that leads the Tibetan people onto the bright road. Not only will 95 percent of Tibetan residents be liberated from the long-term and bitter serfdom, but the entire Tibetan nation will advance shoulder to shoulder with all ethnic groups along the socialist road of common prosperity and common happiness in the unified big family of the motherland.

The great socialist productive forces are singing loudly. Let all ethnic groups, democratic classes, and democratic parties in our country unite as one under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, persevere in struggle, and constantly promote the superiority and righteousness of socialism.

　　伟大的社会主义的优越性
    李平心委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，是如实地反映我国历史性变化和全民大跃进的巨丽诗篇，也是全面地总结1958年各方面的成就与经验和昭示今后建设的任务与方针的重大文献。它鼓舞了六亿五千万人在社会主义长途上的胜利进军，增强了大家对于明天的确信。李富春和李先念两位副总理的报告，分别把我国在经济战线上和财政战线上已经取得的胜利和将要取得的更大胜利作了明确的概述，使大家通过系统的说明和巨额的数字，亲切地看到了祖国今年国民经济建设的宏伟画面，看到了与国民经济建设相适应的财力、物力与人力合理调度的灿烂图谱。一切热爱党和人民事业的人无不感到欢欣奋发。
    我们近十年间建国的辉煌胜利，特别是1953年实行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划以来在各个战线上的空前成就，充分证明了社会主义是引导我国走向富强幸福的唯一正确的道路。去年开始执行第二个五年计划，出现了全面大跃进的壮丽局面，更加突出地表现了社会主义制度不容争辩的优越性与正义性。说优越性，是指这个以生产资料公有制为基础的社会经济形态，具有开辟物质富源和精神富源无限强盛的创造力；说正义性，是指这个以和平劳动为经纬的社会经济形态，拥有繁衍人类共同幸福永无穷尽的生命力。而优越性和正义性是互相统一的。我们面对着资本主义体系怀抱着高度的优越感，恰正因为我们紧靠着世界光明力量充满了热烈的正义感；这种优越感和正义感不外是社会主义的优越性和正义性在我们思想情绪上的反映。
    从周总理的报告中，我们知道我国去年许多主要的工农业产品的产量都比前年增长了一倍以上；今年以四大指标为中心的各种工农业产品的计划产量，又大大超过了去年的产量。其中最值得注意的是钢产量增长的惊人速度。钢的产量前年是五百三十五万吨，去年增至一千一百零八万吨，即是一年间在相当巨大的产量基数上猛跳了一倍多，也就是增加了五百七十三万吨，这个增产量同日本在1937年即对我国发动全面侵略战争的那年的钢产量五百八十万吨很相近。今年我国的钢产量指标是一千八百万吨，同去年钢产量相比，虽没有达到一倍，但计划增产量为六百九十二万吨，在保证优质标准的条件之下，就绝对数字说，仍比去年对前年的增产量超过了许多。若果拿今年钢的计划产量同解放前钢的最高年产量九十二万吨相比，将增加近二十倍。若果单从产量增长的速度来考察，拿我国同竞赛对手英国来比，钢产量从五百多万吨增加到一千一百万吨，英国大约经过了三十二年；从一千一百万吨增加到一千八百万吨，英国大约经过了十八年；而我国则各为一年（今年钢产量指标可能超额完成；若果超额实现，第二对比时间当相应缩短）。去年我国煤炭、生铁、棉织品、糖等重要工业产品的产量都已经超过了英国。可以相信，钢产量超过英国的日子不久就要到来了。
    钢是推动工业生产网全面扩展的“纲”，从钢的高速增产不难测定一般工业产品增产的远景；工业的飞速增长，又必然促进农业和文化教育事业加快高涨。
    我国的经济战线是整个社会主义体系经济战线的一部分，工农业在我国飞跃发展，即是意味着整个社会主义体系的生产力有了重大的新的腾涨。这不禁使我们回忆到两个多月前赫鲁晓夫在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上所作的关于七年计划的报告，从那篇历史性的报告中，通过雄辩的数字，我们不仅看出了苏联的工业增长速度大大超过了美国，而且看出了整个社会主义体系的工业增长速度远远超过了整个资本主义体系。根据赫鲁晓夫的报告，再参考其它经济资料，可以推定：从一九三九年到一九五八年，二十年间社会主义列国的工业生产总额增加了八倍半，而资本主义列国增加不到一倍。从一九五四年到一九五八年，五年间整个社会主义体系的工业生产，每年平均增长率为百分之十一，而在整个资本主义体系还不到百分之三。
    资本主义生产曾经以巨大的增长速度证明自己优越于封建主义，如今社会主义生产又以新的巨大的增长速度证明自己优越于资本主义。但是拿社会主义同资本主义来对照，我们不只可以肯定前者具有超过后者的显著的优越性，而且可以断言前者具有后者所没有的鲜明的正义性。社会主义的优越性与正义性不但体现在生产关系性质上，而且体现在生产力性质上。
    大家都知道，生产关系适应生产力性质的规律，是在一切社会经济形态发生作用的普遍的经济规律。生产力性质可以被理解为生产力的物质属性与社会属性的总和。由于生产力与生产关系相互作用的结果，使两者不能不各自打上历史的烙印，这就是说，不但生产关系总和是历史的范畴，生产力总和也是历史的范畴；它们在一定的社会发展阶段，都带有互相照应而又互相矛盾的特有的历史性质。最活跃最革命的生产力，在客观上不断要求突破生产关系的局限。资本主义生产关系除非被迫让位于社会主义生产关系，总是对生产力起抗拒、压迫和限制的消极作用；愈到后来，这种消极作用愈是增强，一直到经过社会革命，全部解消为止。在社会主义制度之下，生产力和生产关系也有矛盾，但这种矛盾不带有对抗性，因为生产关系可以经过自觉的、及时的、和平的调整活动，经常处于有系统的新陈代谢过程中，经常促进生产力的发展。而只有建筑在生产资料公有基础上的社会主义生产关系才具有这种完全区别于资本主义生产关系的性能。不仅如此，社会主义的生产力性质也不同于资本主义；这首先是由于经过了社会主义革命和社会主义改造，经过了集体主义生产与生活的陶铸，社会主义体系中的劳动者和他们的劳动性质已经发生了根本的变化。既然作为社会主义生产力的主要因素的劳动者，在社会地位、生活面貌和精神实质各方面都和资本主义制度下的劳动者完全两样，那末，其他各领域的社会主义生产力也就不能不发生相应的质的变化。
    在资本主义社会里，生产物质财富的劳动者没有生产资料，而拥有生产资料的资本家和地主却不劳动；劳动力和生产资料相结合，必须通过市场关系和剥削关系才能实现。资本主义使劳动和生产大规模地社会化，工人阶级的劳动应当是社会劳动；但是由于生产资料和劳动产品归资产阶级占有，劳动和劳动条件分离，生产是在无数分散的割据的大小资本王国中进行，劳动力使用却秉有十足的私人性与孤立性。劳动的社会性只有通过市场上的商品交换才能显露出来。资本主义社会经济的基本矛盾——生产的社会性与占有的私人性之间的矛盾，很大一部分自始至终表现在社会劳动和私人劳动之间的矛盾上，表现在生产劳动社会化和劳动使用私人性之间的矛盾上。既然社会劳动总量为各个资本王国所零碎分割，和社会物化劳动总额的零碎分割相适应，既然活劳动的使用盲目地听命于互相角逐互相排斥的资本家和资本集团，这就必然加剧资本主义生产关系的相对狭隘性和生产的高度社会化之间的冲突；作为社会生产力主要组成部分的劳动力，越来越严重地遭到破坏和浪费，便成为资本主义社会无可救药的痼疾。这种痼疾，只有经过社会主义革命和社会主义改造，才能完全治愈。
    资产阶级总爱宣扬资本主义经济政治的自由与平等，但在商品化笼罩一切、资本统治一切的社会里，所谓自由与平等，不外是通过商品交换关系和资本法权关系掩盖对劳动者的剥削与压迫的实质的空花幻影。在资本主义制度之下，统治阶级有榨取劳动人民和摧毁社会进步力量的自由，而劳动人民只有挨饿吃苦的自由；富翁向穷人大谈平等，无异豺狼向羔羊大谈兼爱。资本主义社会经济的根本性质和资本家商品生产的主要目的，决定了劳动人民处于被束缚被损害的地位，也决定了整个社会生产劳动带有越来越严重的强迫性与奴役性；这种强迫性与奴役性和劳动力买卖的自由形式与平等假象呈现了异常尖锐的矛盾。
    资产阶级反动集团总是要按照资本主义原则，竭力保存一切野蛮的强迫制度和奴役制度，否则他们便活不下去。最近帝国主义和外国反动派公开支持西藏一小撮叛匪，妄图在西藏打开一个窟窿，破坏我国的主权统一和领土完整；不自量力地梦想用冰屑泥丸阻塞社会主义、和平与民主的正义洪流；梦想永远保全资本主义世界最野蛮的强迫制度和奴役制度，保全为帝国主义服务的最黑暗的农奴制度。但是，梦想可以暂时安慰对明天失去了信心的群魔，却无助于他们稳定自己的脚跟，因为他们是站在日趋崩裂的奴隶主义的冰山上。
    社会主义和残害劳动人民的强迫制度与奴役制度是绝不相容的，这个社会制度给劳动创造性和劳动者幸福开辟了广远无边的新天地。因为在社会主义经济制度之下，社会劳动权和财富（生产资料和劳动产品）所有权是完全统一的，劳动社会性和财产公有制是完全适合的；生产的目的，不是为了追求利润，而是为了不断增进全体人民的福利，不断促进社会的繁荣与文明。这就决定了整个社会的劳动带有真正的自由性与自觉性，这种自由性与自觉性也反映在和推广到全部的政治生活与社会生活中。
    由于生产资料和劳动总产品的公有制成为社会经济关系的基础，共同的社会劳动和公有的劳动条件始终合而为一，生产是按照全社会的生产需要与消费需要有计划地进行，所以没有社会劳动与私人劳动之间的矛盾；整个社会的劳动力是归国家或集体统一调度，统一分配的。劳动力不带商品性，劳动使用也不带私人性，所以劳动秉有直接的社会性，每个人直接为社会劳动，同时也为自己劳动；每一个人的劳动成果，就是直接属于社会的公共财富的一部分。
    社会主义确立了和不断巩固着生产资料公有制，实行了和不断改善着共同劳动制与按劳分配制，并且为逐渐消除脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别和城市与乡村的差别创设条件，这就实现了人与人之间的真正平等。在将来进入共产主义社会之后，由于各种差别和旧式权利残余的消失，这种平等基础还要进一步加深增广。
    社会主义的自由平等和资本主义的所谓自由平等对照起来，正好像白日的大海和黑夜的枯井之比；我们有权利歌颂大海的浩阔，藐视枯井的卑污。帝国主义者和他们的附庸　　外国反动派妄想挖出枯井的污泥掩没大海的洪涛；就算他们这样十分卖力，至多也只能激起一阵转瞬就要消灭的泡沫；一切违背历史正义潮流的反动势力本身也将不免于泡沫的命运。
    社会主义不仅实现了人与人之间的平等劳动关系，而且实现了人力与物力之间的主从关系。在这里，不是过去劳动宰制活劳动，而是活劳动统治过去劳动；不是劳动者隶属于生产工具，而是生产工具听命于劳动者。劳动者成了生产的真正主人，他们的劳动受到社会的尊敬，也受到国家和社会无微不至的保护。和资本主义社会财富生产量愈增加劳动人民愈贫困的荒谬制度相反，在社会主义国家里，社会总产品愈是丰富，劳动人民的物质生活和精神生活水平愈是增高。物质生产和社会需要互相推动，个人生活利益和社会发展利益彼此统一，不仅易于滋长全体劳动者的生产兴趣，而且易于提高他们的社会觉悟，而生产兴趣和社会觉悟结合起来，正是刺激劳动生产率不断增长的主要动力。
    毫无疑义，经过了社会主义革命和社会主义改造，人的劳动性质已经发生了根本的变化。随着社会主义生产的发展，这种变化是在继续扩大和加深，这必然会把蕴藏在社会劳动中巨大无比的能量不断地解放出来，因而也必然会不停顿地推动全部社会生产力向前跃进。
    在社会主义生产关系基础上新的劳动性质决定了生产力发展的性质和速度，也加强了社会主义制度的优越性和正义性。我们相信，我国生产力的飞跃发展，不但足以保证胜利地完成和超额完成一九五九年经济战线和文化战线上的任务，而且它在整个社会主义制度的优越性与正义性的基础上，足以保证我国在不远的将来，成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的繁荣幸福的国家。
    当我们正在社会主义大道上胜利进军的时候，不能不想到正要开始摆脱农奴制度进入历史新时期的西藏兄弟。大家知道，西藏的封建农奴制度和祖国的社会主义制度与人民民主制度是绝不相容的。在那里，广大农民牧民在农奴主的残酷剥削和苛暴压迫之下，过着辛酸愁惨的非人生活，死亡率和逃亡率都非常高，结果使西藏的社会生产力遭到绝大破坏，使西藏的社会经济文化发展受到严重阻碍。为了保存这种暗无天日的封建奴役制度，西藏上层反动集团一直阻挠着实行社会改革；并且丧心病狂地勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，企图依靠他们的力量来分裂祖国，恢复外国侵略者在西藏的殖民主义势力；使农奴主们永远残踏西藏劳动人民的肉体与灵魂，过着荒淫无耻的腐烂生活。如今他们已经走上了自绝于全国人民的灭亡道路，受到了应得的膺惩！任何力量也不能阻止把西藏人民引上光明大道的社会改革运动。不但百分之九十五的西藏居民会从长期的悲苦的农奴状态中解放出来，整个西藏民族将在祖国的统一大家庭中和各族并肩携手沿着共同繁荣共同幸福的社会主义道路前进。
    伟大的社会主义生产力正在响亮地歌唱。让我国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派在党和毛主席的睿智领导之下团结一致，坚持奋斗，不断发扬社会主义的优越性与正义性。
