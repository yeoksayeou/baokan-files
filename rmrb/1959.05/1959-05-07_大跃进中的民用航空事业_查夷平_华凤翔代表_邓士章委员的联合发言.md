Chairman, fellow delegates, fellow committee members:

We fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. We express our boundless anger towards the rebellious actions of the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper strata in colluding with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and towards the expansionist elements in India for their conspiracy to undermine our national unity and the unity of our nationalities.

We are civil aviation workers, and now we would like to give a brief report to the congress on civil aviation.

Transport and Specialized Aviation Completed the First Five-Year Plan One to Two Years Ahead of Schedule

China's civil aviation, like other economic construction undertakings, has made great progress under the correct leadership of the Party and the government during the First Five-Year Plan. Transport aviation completed the First Five-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule. In 1957, the total length of routes reached over 26,000 kilometers, 2.2 times that of 1952. A transportation network was established with Beijing as the center and 42 cities at home and abroad as auxiliary trunk lines. The total transport turnover in 1957 was 3.5 times that of 1952, with an average annual increase of 28.6 percent.

Specialized aviation was first established in China in 1952. By the end of 1957, various businesses such as aerial photography, aerial prospecting, pest control, fertilization, forest protection, and forest surveys had been launched. The workload calculated by flight hours was ten times that of 1952, with an average annual increase of 60.6 percent, completing the First Five-Year Plan more than two years ahead of schedule.

Civil Aviation Ensures Flight Safety

1958 was a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward for China's socialist construction. With the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's civil aviation, under the brilliant guidance of the Party's General Line, also achieved great successes.

Through the great rectification movement, the vast number of civil aviation workers have generally improved their political awareness. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, they mobilized the masses, tapped potential, improved business management, and reduced costs by 32 percent. With state approval, passenger and freight rates were reduced by 40 percent from July 1 last year. Encouraged by the Great Leap Forward situation across the country, the whole bureau launched a technical revolution movement with "safety in production as the key" in the second half of 1958, putting forward a large number of technical innovation projects and rationalization proposals, which made great contributions to the development of China's civil aviation and ensuring flight safety.

Over the past year, both transport and specialized aviation have overfulfilled their production plans.

The total transport turnover was 127.2 percent of the annual plan, an increase of 49.3 percent over 1957. Passenger traffic exceeded the plan by 30 percent, and freight traffic almost doubled. All major production indicators far exceeded the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. In the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, civil aviation aircraft rushed large quantities of pesticides, fish fry, sheep breeds, dairy cows, silkworm eggs, pig feed, and crop seedlings and seeds to various places, powerfully supporting agricultural production, and were thus welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. During the days of the nationwide steelmaking campaign, civil aviation, according to the principle of "taking steel as the key and ensuring key points," with the strong support of the air force, continuously rushed large quantities of electric motors, blowers, and other steelmaking equipment to remote and inaccessible areas. From September to November last year, which was the most intense period of the nationwide steelmaking campaign, the volume of transportation of various smelting equipment accounted for more than half of the civil aviation's freight volume at that time.

The workload of specialized aviation, calculated by flight hours, was 127 percent of the annual plan, an increase of 94.6 percent over 1957. Among them, the projects serving industry and capital construction grew particularly fast. Compared with 1957, aerial photography increased by 179.7 percent, and aerial prospecting increased by 140 percent. The specialized aviation in 1958 not only saw a great development in workload, but also added new businesses such as sowing tree seeds, grass seeds, and preventing and controlling wheat rust, and achieved good economic results. Taking physical prospecting as an example, hundreds of mineral deposits with extremely large reserves were discovered in 1958. Civil aviation aircraft also undertook the aerial surveying tasks for the Baotou Iron and Steel Base and the "Great Northern Wilderness" reclamation area. At the same time, in coordination with the railway departments, they carried out aerial route selection projects in more than a dozen provinces and regions such as Yunnan, Gansu, and Xinjiang, providing timely topographic data for the construction of railways. In terms of agricultural aviation, flight hours in 1958 increased by 57.9 percent compared with 1957, of which the area using aircraft to kill locusts and cotton insects was more than 8 million mu. Due to the fast speed, large operation area, and good quality of aircraft pest control, a large amount of labor can be saved, and the economic effect is very significant. Gaotang County, Shandong Province, used aircraft to control cotton insects in 1958, which not only increased production by 40 percent, but also had low costs, only one-sixth of the cost of manual prevention. In order to quickly prevent sandstorms and green the desert, civil aviation undertook the task of sowing tree seeds and grass seeds on a large area. One aircraft can sow 25,000 mu per day, and the sowing is uniform with a very high germination rate. The experience in 1958 proved that using aircraft to sow tree seeds and grass seeds is one of the important ways to transform the desert on a large scale.

Open Local Routes Centered on Provincial Capitals to Support Economic Construction and Accelerate Cultural Exchange

Over the past year, 20 local routes centered on provincial capitals have been opened, with a route length of over 6,700 kilometers. These newly opened local routes are connected to domestic trunk lines, further strengthening the links between the capital and provincial capitals, provincial capitals and certain special zones or industrial cities, playing a certain role in supporting economic construction in the north, accelerating cultural exchange, and facilitating travel for the people.

Through the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have not only achieved great results in transport aviation and specialized aviation, but also explored some preliminary experience in building civil aviation. In 1959, China's national economy will see a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward than in 1958, and civil aviation will also have greater development. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, vigorously mobilizing the masses, continuing to implement the working policy of "ensuring safety first, improving service work, and striving for normal flights," taking "safety in production as the key, focusing on political ideology, production plans, cadre training, capital construction, and planning measures," and with the close cooperation of all relevant units, China's civil aviation will be further developed and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　大跃进中的民用航空事业
    查夷平　华凤翔代表　邓士章委员的联合发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我们完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。我们对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和蒋匪帮的叛乱行为，对于印度扩张主义分子阴谋破坏我们的祖国统一和民族团结表示无比的愤怒。
    我们是民用航空的工作人员，现在仅就民用航空事业向大会作一简要汇报。
    运输专业、航空都提前一年到二年多完成第一个五年计划
    我国民用航空事业，和其他经济建设事业一样，在党和政府正确领导下，在第一个五年计划期间，有了很大的发展。运输航空提前一年多的时间完成了第一个五年计划。一九五七年航线总长达二万六千余公里，为一九五二年的二点二倍。建立了以北京为中心，以国内外四十二个城市为辅干线的航运网。运输总周转量一九五七年为一九五二年的三点五倍，每年平均增长百分之二十八点六。
    专业航空在我国首创于一九五二年，到一九五七年底，已开办了航空摄影、航空探矿、灭虫、施肥、护林、森林调查等各种业务，按飞行小时计算的工作量为一九五二年的十倍，每年平均增长百分之六十点六，提前二年多的时间即完成了第一个五年计划。
    民航事业保证了飞行安全
    一九五八年是我国社会主义建设事业全面大跃进的一年。随着工农业生产的大跃进，我国民用航空事业，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，也取得了很大的成就。
    经过伟大的整风运动，民航广大职工群众普遍提高了政治觉悟，在党委的领导下，发动群众，挖掘潜力，改进了经营管理，降低了成本百分之三十二，经国家批准，从去年七月一日起客货运价降低百分之四十。在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，一九五八年下半年，全局范围内又掀起了一个以“安全生产为纲”的技术革命运动，提出了大量的技术革新项目和合理化建议，对于发展我国民航事业，保证飞行安全，有着极大的贡献。
    一年来，运输航空和专业航空都超额完成了生产计划。
    运输总周转量为年度计划的百分之一百二十七点二，比一九五七年增长百分之四十九点三，客运量超过计划百分之三十，货运量差不多翻了一个番。各项主要生产指标远远超过了第一个五年计划时期的平均发展速度。在农业大跃进中，民航飞机把大批的农药、鱼苗、羊种、乳牛、蚕种、生猪饲料和农作物的秧苗、种子等赶运到各地，有力地支援了农业生产，因而受到了广大农民群众的欢迎。在全民炼钢的日子里，民航根据“以钢为纲，保证重点”的原则，在空军大力支持下，为边远和交通不便地区连续赶运了大批的电动机、鼓风机和其它的炼钢设备。在去年九月到十一月，也就是在全民炼钢最紧张的时刻，各种冶炼设备的运输量约占当时民航货运量的一半以上。
    专业航空按飞行小时计算的工作量，为年度计划的百分之一百二十七，比一九五七年增长百分之九十四点六，其中为工业和基本建设服务的项目增长得特别快，与一九五七年比较，航空摄影增长百分之一百七十九点七，航空探矿增长百分之一百四十。一九五八年的专业航空，不仅工作量有了很大的发展，而且新增了播树种、草种、防治小麦绣病等业务，并取得了良好的经济效果。以物理探矿为例，一九五八年就发现了几百处矿藏，储量极大。民航飞机还担任了包头钢铁基地和“北大荒”垦区的航空测量任务，同时配合铁道部门，在云南、甘肃、新疆等十几个省区进行航空选线工程，为兴建铁路及时提供了地形资料。在农业航空方面，飞行小时一九五八年比一九五七年增加了百分之五十七点九，其中用飞机灭蝗虫和棉虫的面积有八百多万亩。由于飞机治虫速度快，作业面积大，质量好，能节省大量劳动力，经济效果很显著，山东省高唐县一九五八年用飞机治棉虫，不仅增产了百分之四十，而且费用低，只为人工防治的六分之一。为了迅速防治流沙，绿化沙漠，民航曾担任了大面积播树种草种的任务，一架飞机一天可以播种二万五千亩，而且播撒均匀，发芽率极高。一九五八年的经验证明，用飞机播树种，草种，是大规模地改造沙漠的重要途径之一。
    开辟以省会为中心的地方航线支援经济建设，加速文化交流
    一年来，开辟了以省会为中心的地方航线二十条，航线长达六千七百余公里。这些新辟的地方航线和国内干线互相衔接，进一步加强了首都和省会，省会和某些专区或工业城市之间的联系，对支援北方的经济建设和加速文化交流，以及便利人民群众旅行等方面起到了一定的作用。
    通过一九五八年的全面大跃进，我们不仅在运输航空和专业航空方面获得了很大的成绩，而且也摸索到一些建设民航的初步经验。一九五九年我国国民经济将出现一个比一九五八年更大、更好和更全面的跃进，民航事业也将有更大的发展。我们相信，在党的正确领导下，大力发动群众，继续贯彻“保证安全第一，改进服务工作，争取飞行正常”的工作方针，以“安全生产为纲，抓政治思想、抓生产计划、抓干部培训、抓基本建设、抓规划措施”，在各有关单位的密切协作下，我国的民用航空事业将会得到更大的发展，为祖国的社会主义建设事业作出更多的贡献。
