Comrade He Siyuan said:

	British imperialism and Indian expansionists are stepping up their subversive activities in Tibet, which is an interference in our internal affairs and a violation of humanitarianism. Chairman, fellow committee members:
	I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and fully agree with the work report made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan on behalf of the CPPCC Standing Committee.
	I will now talk about the armed rebellion launched by the Tibetan traitorous group.
	In April 1956, I followed the central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi to Tibet, visited various parts of Tibet for more than eighty days, widely contacted upper-class figures in Tibet, and also visited farmers, herdsmen, and lamas. At that time, I got the impression that the Tibetan people's lives were difficult, living a dark and hopeless life. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951, the People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet have respected the Tibetan people's religious beliefs and customs and helped the Tibetan region develop various construction undertakings. Over the years, they have handled price stabilization every year, issued interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans, established a number of hospitals and schools, built water conservancy projects, built roads, opened river embankments, helped people reclaim wasteland, improved agriculture, and so on. The lives of the Tibetan people, who were in poverty and backwardness, have been improved. The spirit of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, thinking of the interests of the Tibetan people everywhere, and the vivid facts made the Tibetan people sincerely feel the warmth of the motherland's big family, sincerely love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and thus initially established a socialist national relationship with the Han people.
	According to the Tibetan system, land is owned by the serf owners, so in front of the serf owners, farmers have no personal freedom. They cannot even control their own property, and even their wives are arbitrarily trampled on by the serf owners. In addition to paying taxes and performing corvée labor for the landlords, even if they participate in various construction projects held by the Tibet Work Committee, they have to pay half or more of the wages they earn from their labor to the landlords. When I was in Lhasa, I asked some Tibetan workers, and they all indignantly narrated their pain, saying that they could not live without reform and could not be completely liberated. Some Tibetan compatriots even ran to the Tibet Work Committee to complain about their experiences and the exploitation of the landlords. We heard calls for social reform everywhere in Tibet. This call came not only from the general Tibetan people, but also from many patriotic and progressive people in the upper and middle levels of Tibet, who also put forward the requirements for social reform. They also realized that "the implementation of democratic reform is a process that Tibet must go through for national development and progress, and a gradual transition to socialism." Without democratic reform, "the previous backward situation cannot be changed, and the progress and development of the Tibetan people cannot be realized."
	However, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group opposed the implementation of social reform in Tibet and妄想妄想 to permanently preserve their serf system. They repeatedly violated the Seventeen-Article Agreement and repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged it.
	The Communist Party and the Central People's Government, proceeding from the interests of national unity, have always adopted a policy of slowing down the pace of reform and patiently waiting for the upper-class elements to become aware.
	However, the upper-class reactionaries in Tibet believed that the central government's slow pace and patient waiting were signs of weakness and could be deceived. In recent years, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group continued to collude with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries, attempting to rely on their strength to split the motherland, restore the imperialist aggressive forces in Tibet, and preserve Tibet's backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system. We heard some provocative and destructive remarks in various parts of Tibet, and also saw some upper-class reactionaries harboring hostile attitudes and obstructing the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, the central government still adopted a policy of patient waiting, persuasion, and education, giving the original Tibetan local government and upper-class elements ample time to consider, and did not immediately carry out reforms. To this day, Tibet is the only region in the country that has not undergone democratic reform. The central government has done everything it can for them.
	Recently, British imperialists and Indian expansionists have taken the opportunity to step up their subversive activities in Tibet, instigating some Tibetans to betray the motherland, which is an act of interfering in our internal affairs and violating humanitarianism. The original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group openly launched an armed rebellion, which is a traitorous crime of a small group of national scum who undermine national unity and endanger the unification of the motherland. People all over the world can see that this is not a "national issue" or a "religious event," but a small group of national scum using the banner of the nation to engage in activities that betray the motherland. However, some people with ulterior motives still say they "sympathize" with them, sympathize with those who betray the motherland, sympathize with those who exploit the people, and sympathize with those who sell out national interests. What point of view does this "sympathy" stem from?
	Some foreign "good people" are afraid that the Tibetan people will be
"oppressed" and "suppressed," but it is precisely the small group of people from the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group who colluded with British imperialism, Indian expansionists, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang that oppressed and suppressed the Tibetan people, preventing them from escaping the cruel system of exploitation and preventing them from embarking on economic prosperity and a happy life. If "good people" are truly kind, how can they treat the traitors of the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group as friends?
	The People's Liberation Army's troops stationed in Tibet were able to quickly quell the rebellion, which proves that the People's Liberation Army is supported by the broad masses of the Tibetan people. The credit for quickly quelling the Tibetan rebellion must be attributed to the Tibet Military Region, the Tibet Work Committee, and all the staff working in Tibet, who respect the Tibetan religious beliefs, respect the Tibetan customs and habits, and respect the Tibetan people's right to autonomy. Over the years, because of their modesty and prudence, hard work and perseverance, and unswerving implementation of the central government's ethnic policies and strict implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement, they have united the Tibetan people, strengthened the understanding between ethnic groups, and won new socialist ethnic relations. Not only are the Tibetan people grateful to them; I was also very moved by their spirit of sacrifice and selflessness that I saw in Tibet. Today, the broad masses of the Tibetan people continue to support them in thoroughly eliminating the sporadic rebels in Tibet, and the social order in Tibet has been consolidated.
	Now, the armed rebellion has been basically quelled, and the Tibetan reactionaries have suffered a complete defeat. I believe that the Tibetan people's desire to get rid of the shackles of the dark serf system will surely be quickly realized. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and with the help of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, the Tibetan people will surely gradually embark on the brilliant socialist road and gradually realize the new life of democracy, freedom, and happiness that they have longed for for many years.

### 这是什么“同情心”？！

    这是什么“同情心”？！
    何思源委员说：
    英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子竟加紧策划在西藏的颠覆活动，这是干涉我国内政和违反人道的行为。主席，各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，完全同意李维汉副主席代表政协常委会所作的工作报告。
    我现在谈谈西藏叛国集团发动武装叛乱事件。
    一九五六年四月，我曾追随以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团到过西藏，在西藏各地访问了八十多天，广泛接触过西藏的上层人物，也访问了农民、牧民和喇嘛。当时，我得到这样一个印象：西藏人民生活是困苦的，过着暗无天日的生活。自从一九五一年西藏和平解放后，进藏的解放军和工作人员，尊重藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，帮助西藏地区发展各项建设事业。几年来，年年办理平粜，发放无息农牧贷款，兴办了若干医院、学校，兴修水利，修筑公路，开河堤，帮助人民开垦荒地，改进农业等等。处于贫困、落后状况的西藏人民，生活才有所改善。共产党和解放军处处为西藏人民利益着想的精神，活生生的事实，使藏族人民衷心感到祖国大家庭的温暖，衷心热爱共产党和毛主席，从而与汉族初步建立了社会主义的民族关系。
    按照西藏的制度，土地是归农奴主所占有的，因此，在农奴主的面前，农民是没人身自由的，对于自己的一点财产，自己也不能当家，即使自己的妻子也由农奴主任意蹂躏。农民除了向地主纳税并服劳役外，即使自己在参加西藏工委所举办的各种建设工程，由于自己劳动而挣来的工资，也得向地主缴半数或半数以上。我在拉萨时，就问过一些藏族工人，他们都是愤慨地叙述他们的痛苦，并说非改革不能生活下去，不能得到彻底解放。甚至有些藏族同胞跑到西藏工委哭诉他们的遭遇和地主的剥削。我们在西藏到处听到要求社会改革的呼声。这种呼声不但来自一般藏族人民，西藏上层和中层的许多爱国进步人士，也提出了社会改革的要求。他们也认识到“实行民主改革是西藏民族向前发展和进步，逐步过渡到社会主义必须经历的过程”，如果没有民主改革“以往落后的状况就不能改变，藏族的进步和发展，是不能实现的”。
    但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团反对在西藏实行社会改革，妄想永远保存他们的农奴制度。一再违背十七条协议，一再阻挠破坏。
    共产党和中央人民政府从民族团结的利益出发，对于西藏的改革，一直采取放慢步骤和耐心等待上层分子觉悟的方针。
    然而，西藏上层反动分子却认为中央的放慢步骤和耐心等待的宽大态度是软弱可欺。几年来，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团继续勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，企图依靠他们的力量来分裂祖国，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，保存西藏的落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度。我们在西藏各地，就听到一些挑拨、破坏的言论，也见到一些上层反动分子暗怀敌意的态度以及阻挠西藏自治区筹备委员会工作的事情。可是，中央仍然采取耐心等待、说服教育的政策，让原西藏地方政府和上层分子有充分考虑的时间，并未立即进行改革，至今西藏是全国唯一的未进行民主改革的地区。中央对他们已仁至义尽了。
    近来英帝国主义者和印度的扩张主义分子竟乘机加紧策划在西藏的颠覆活动，煽动西藏的一些人背叛祖国，这是一种干涉我国内政、违背人道的行为。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，公开武装叛乱，这是一小撮破坏民族团结、危害祖国统一的民族败类的叛国罪行。全世界人都看得出来，这不是什么“民族问题”，更不是什么“宗教事件”，而是那一小撮民族败类打着民族旗子，干着背叛祖国的勾当。可是，有些别有用心的人还说“同情”他们，同情背叛祖国的人，同情剥削人民的人，同情出卖民族利益的人，这种“同情”心，究竟是从什么观点出发的呢？
    又有些外国的“好心人”怕西藏人民受到
  “压迫”受到“镇压”，可是，压迫西藏人民，镇压西藏人民，使他们不能摆脱残酷的剥削制度，使他们不能走上经济繁荣和幸福生活的，恰恰就是勾结英帝国主义、印度扩张主义分子和蒋匪集团的原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团那一小撮人。“好心人”如果真有好心，岂能把西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的叛国分子，当作朋友来对待？
    解放军驻藏部队能够很快地平息叛乱，这就证明解放军是得到西藏广大人民的支持的。迅速平息西藏叛乱的功劳，不能不归功于西藏军区、西藏工委，以及所有进藏工作人员，他们尊重西藏的宗教信仰，尊重藏胞的风俗习惯，尊重藏族的自治权利。几年来，由于他们谦虚谨慎，任劳任怨，坚忍不拔地贯彻执行了中央的民族政策，严格地执行了十七条协议，从而团结了西藏人民，加强了民族间的认识，才赢得新的社会主义的民族关系。不只藏族感激他们；我在西藏亲眼看见他们那种牺牲忘我的精神，也非常感动。今天，西藏广大人民继续支持他们在西藏彻底肃清零星的叛乱分子，西藏社会秩序已经得到巩固。
    现在，武装叛乱已基本上被平息了，西藏反动派遭到了彻底的失败。我相信，西藏人民摆脱黑暗农奴制度枷锁的愿望，必能迅速实现。西藏人民在共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在祖国各族人民的帮助下，必能逐步地走上光辉的社会主义道路，逐步地实现他们多少年来渴望的民主、自由、幸福的新生活。
