    Liaoning, Sichuan, and Fujian
    Set Off a New High Tide of Fertilizer Accumulation

    This newspaper reports from Shenyang on the 20th: Liaoning Province's various people's communes have launched a crash fertilizer accumulation campaign in conjunction with spring planting.

    According to the requirements of Liaoning Province's agricultural production leap forward plan for this year, the amount of fertilizer applied must be more than doubled compared to last year. In order to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on various regions to launch another crash fertilizer accumulation campaign in conjunction with spring planting, to dig out all fertilizer sources and ensure sufficient fertilizer. After carefully checking the fertilizer application situation in their localities, the Party committees of various cities and counties made emergency deployments accordingly. Many communes implemented a province-wide crash fertilizer accumulation campaign.

    Various regions have also generally combined crash fertilizer accumulation with perennial fertilizer accumulation, collective fertilizer accumulation with individual commune member fertilizer accumulation, and reasonably adjusted manure prices, which powerfully promoted the development of the crash fertilizer accumulation campaign. According to statistics from seven counties in the Jinzhou area in early May, more than 110,000 people participated in the crash fertilizer accumulation campaign every day. The Zhongnan Production Brigade of the Zhong'an Commune, due to the implementation of a method combining collective fertilizer accumulation and individual commune member fertilizer accumulation, and the reasonable adjustment of manure prices, achieved both the fertilizer accumulation task and remuneration, and comprehensively arranged the labor force of people and animals for cultivation, planting, and fertilizer accumulation.

    This newspaper reports from Chengdu on the 20th: The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an emergency notice to Party committees at all levels to carry out a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, calling on the province to launch a sustained fertilizer accumulation and production campaign in May and June.

    Currently, the fertilizer accumulation campaign is rapidly unfolding in various regions. In just a few days, Tongnan, Suining, and Pengxi counties mobilized 300,000 people to collect green manure. Shehong County mobilized the masses to collect materials locally, accumulate and produce fertilizer locally, accumulating, producing, transporting, and using fertilizer simultaneously, combining fertilizer accumulation, production, preservation, transportation, and application. The county's major spring crops have already been fertilized with an average of more than 60,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu.

    The fertilizer accumulation and production campaign in various regions is generally led by secretaries and cadres taking the lead, fully mobilizing the masses. Zhang Jinsheng and Liu Maode, secretaries of the Deyang County Party Committee, braved the rain to pull carts to accumulate and transport fertilizer, which greatly encouraged the masses. In addition to leaders taking the lead, various regions have also launched competitions between communes, teams, and individuals, adopting methods such as quantitative labor based on labor, bonuses for exceeding quotas, and piece-rate remuneration, which greatly stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation.

    This newspaper reports: A field management campaign centered on fertilizer accumulation and topdressing has been launched throughout Fujian Province.

    In launching the summer production high tide, all regions have focused on fertilizer accumulation and transportation for field management, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and the actual conditions of the local area. Representatives from six people's communes in the coastal areas of Ningde County went to the Wuliyang Commune to discuss major plans, study joint attacks on the ocean to accumulate large amounts of seaweed fertilizer, and resolved to fight hard for ten and a half days to jointly accumulate more than 11 million dan of seaweed fertilizer. Shaowu County mobilized the masses to go up the mountains to collect green manure and ferment it into water-based green fertilizer; in half a month, more than 4.17 million dan of green leaves, tender bamboo shoots, and green grass have been collected. In addition to vigorously promoting the mass movement for fertilizer accumulation, Yong'an County also restored the 850-plus indigenous fertilizer plants established by various communes last year. After rectification, they were adjusted to 54 backbone plants and 388 specialized teams, engaging in a large-scale fertilizer production campaign. After fighting hard for 20 days, a total of more than 110,000 dan of 25 kinds of indigenous fertilizers such as lime nitrogen fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, and potassium nitrate were produced, an increase of five times compared to the actual fertilizer application in the county during the spring of last year. Nan'an put forward the slogan of "thorough cleaning, thorough delivery, and thorough application," requiring that fertilizers be concentrated on the three categories of seedlings, and continuing to step up fertilizer accumulation and topdressing in an all-round way.

    辽宁、四川、福建
    掀起积肥新高潮
    本报沈阳20日电  辽宁省各地人民公社结合春播开展了突击积肥运动。
    根据今年辽宁省农业生产跃进规划的要求，施肥量必须比去年增加一倍以上。为了解决肥料不足的问题，中共辽宁省委号召各地结合春播再开展一次突击积肥运动，挖出一切肥源保证足肥。各市、县委根据省委的指示，在认真检查了本地的施肥情况以后，分别进行了紧急部署。很多公社实行了全民突击积肥。
    各地还普遍把突击积肥和常年积肥、集体积肥和社员个人积肥结合起来，合理调整了粪价，有力地推动了突击积肥运动的开展。锦州地区七个县在5月上旬的统计，每天参加突击积肥运动的就有十一万多人。中安公社中南生产大队由于实行了集体积肥和社员个人积肥结合的方法，合理调整了粪价，作到积肥任务、报酬两落底，全面地安排了耕地、播种、积肥的人畜力。
    本报成都20日电　中共四川省委向各级党委发出了开展大规模积肥造肥运动的紧急通知，号召全省在5、6月份深入开展一个持续的积肥、造肥运动。
    现在，各地积肥运动迅速开展。潼南、遂宁、蓬溪三县几天内就出动了三十万人采青积肥。射洪县发动群众就地取材，就地积造，边积边运边用，把积肥、造肥、保肥、运肥、施肥结合起来。这个县大春作物已经平均每亩施底肥六万多斤。
    各地的积肥造肥运动，一般都由书记挂帅、干部带头，充分发动群众。德阳县委书记张金声、刘茂德冒雨拉架子车积肥运肥，给群众极大鼓舞。除了领导人上阵外，各地还展开了社与社、队与队、个人与个人之间的竞赛，采用按劳定量、超额给奖和按件计酬的办法，大大激发了群众的积肥热情。
    本报讯　一个以积肥、追肥为中心的田间管理运动，已在福建全省范围内开展起来了。
    各地在发动夏季生产高潮中，都根据省委指示和当地的实际情况，以积肥、运肥为田间管理的中心。宁德县沿海地区的六个人民公社派代表到五里洋公社共商大计，研究联合向海洋进攻大积海肥，决心苦战十天半个月，共同积足一千一百多万担海肥。邵武县发动群众上山采青，沤积水绿肥；半个月已采绿叶、嫩笋壳和青草四百一十七万多担。永安县除了大搞积肥群众运动之外，还把去年各公社创办的八百五十多个土化肥厂恢复起来，经过整顿，调整为五十四个骨干厂和三百八十八个专业队，大搞造肥运动，苦战二十天，共计制造石灰氮肥、硫酸铵、硝酸钾等二十五种土化肥十一万多担，比去年春季全县化肥实际施用量增加五倍。南靖提出“大清、大送、大施”的口号，要求把肥料集中施在三类苗上，并继续突击积肥，全面追施肥料。
