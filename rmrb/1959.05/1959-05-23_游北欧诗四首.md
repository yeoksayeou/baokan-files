Four Poems on a Trip to Northern Europe
Guo Moruo

Visiting the Millesgården in Stockholm, Sweden

	I've come to Millesgården three times, its spirit is fresh and free from the mundane.
	A celestial horse soars across the sky, ridden with attached wings,
	Mermaids spray mist, and moss grows on the stones.
	Many beautiful flowers bloom wildly on the rocks,
	The garden is small and exquisite, with paths winding everywhere.
	The tourists have left and the gate is closed,
	The setting sun keeps company, shadows linger.

Sailing the Sea

	A motorboat cruises luxuriously on the sea, basking in the sun, we chat about Cai Wenji.
	The Hun pipes' sorrow and indignation last for a thousand years, a comedic legend is delightful for a moment.
	Ethnic harmony and kinship are the main focus, heroic figures cast in a new image.
	Princess Wencheng shares the same spirit, the Potala Palace in Lhasa has an old stele.

In the Danish Capital, Inscribing a Poem on the Embassy Wall

	May's clear light shines brightly, on Sealand Island, we talk of plowing.
	Cherry blossoms exude beauty, pear blossoms are plain, spring water jets like clouds, the sea is calm.
	The Little Mermaid by the bay seems to enter a dream, the divine steed in the embassy is lifelike.
	Having seen all the scenery of Northern Europe, I happily share Moutai wine.

A Scene from the Embassy Dormitory

	The best part of Copenhagen is enclosed here, the place is quiet as if all sounds have vanished.
	Beyond the dike, the sea and sky urge the dawn, in the garden, flowers and plants praise the east wind.
	Meeting spring twice in a year, flying over three capitals in eight days.
	Revisionist articles are first published abroad, and everyone I meet talks about Cao Cao.

(Note 1) Milles was a Swedish sculptor who passed away several years ago. His former residence is now a museum called "Millesgården."
(Note 2) "Sealand Island" was originally named Sealand. Legend has it that a farmer's wife asked a landlord for land, and the landlord promised her whatever she could plow. The farmer's wife had four sons, who all transformed into oxen and plowed diligently, gaining a large piece of land, which is now "Sealand Island." There is a bronze statue on the island, depicting a woman driving four oxen, with four fountains spraying water, very powerful.
(Note 3) There is a bronze statue of the Little Mermaid on the bay in Copenhagen, from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale. "The divine steed in the embassy" refers to the exhibits in the Thorvaldsen Museum, the museum of the famous eighteenth-century sculptor Thorvaldsen.
(Note 4) Spring in Northern Europe is about two months later than in China, hence the feeling of meeting spring twice a year. Also, from May 5th to 12th, I flew over the capitals of the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Denmark in eight days, hence the so-called "three capitals in eight days."

    游北欧诗四首
    郭沫若
    在瑞典首都游米列士园
    米园三度我曾来，气韵新奇脱鬼胎。
    天马横空骑附翼，人鱼喷雾石生苔。
    花多绮丽依岩放，地小玲珑逐径开。
    游客已归门掩却，斜阳相伴影徘徊。
    游海
    汽艇豪游海上驰，负暄畅话蔡文姬。·
    胡笳悲愤垂千古，喜剧传奇快一时。
    民族和亲为主眼，英雄人物铸新姿。
    文成公主同声气，拉萨巍峨有旧碑。
    在丹麦首都为使馆
    题字补壁
    五月晴光照太清，四郎岛上话牛耕。
    樱花吐艳梨花素，泉水喷云海水平。
    湾畔人鱼疑入梦，馆中神骏浑如生。
    北欧风物今观遍，喜把茅台酒共倾。
    使馆宿舍即景
    丹京佳处此间笼，地静浑疑万籁空。
    堤外海天催晓色，园中花草颂东风。
    一年两度逢红雨，八日三都泛碧穹。
    翻案文章先出国，逢人每听说曹公。
    （注一）米列士乃瑞典雕刻家，数年前逝世。其故居今为陈列馆，号“米列士园”。
    （注二）“四郎岛”原名为Sealand，传说昔有农妇向地主求地，地主许以其力所能耕者予之。农妇有四子，均化为牛而力耕，得地颇广，即今之“四郎岛”。岛上有铜像，一妇驾四牛，喷泉四喷，甚有力。
    （注三）丹京湾畔有人鱼铜像，出自安徒生童话。“馆中神骏”指十八世纪名雕刻家索瓦德生博物馆中陈列品。
    （注四）北欧春季，较我国约迟两月，故有一年两度逢春之感。又自五月五日至十二日，八日之间曾于苏联、瑞典、丹麦三国首都上空飞行，所谓“八日三都”也。
