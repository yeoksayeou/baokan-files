Comrades Chairman and Representatives:

    I fully agree with all the reports of the congress and am willing to resolutely implement them in my work.

    Now, I would like to report to the congress on the achievements of the great leap forward in raw coal production at the Lifeng Mine of Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan Province in 1958, and the action plan for a greater leap forward in 1959.

    Lifeng Mine is an old mine with a history of more than 40 years. In the past, people often said that it "has a large mine but no coal, and water everywhere." Not to mention a great leap forward in production, some people even held pessimistic views about maintaining the original production level. However, in 1958, we broke this superstition. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and driven by the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, through the great rectification campaign, all employees displayed the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, breaking through right-leaning conservative ideas and some unreasonable rules and regulations. With soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and a high degree of labor wisdom, the workers increased raw coal production again and again, and improved labor efficiency again and again. In 1958, the entire mine produced a total of 1,030,000 tons of raw coal, an increase of 68.32 percent over 1957, exceeding the national plan by 66 percent; the overall efficiency increased by 34.85 percent compared to 1957; and the cost of raw coal decreased by 11.58 percent compared to 1957. The output of Lifeng Mine's first pair of shafts last year was equal to the output of the entire Jiaozuo Coal Mine for two years before liberation! The workers happily said, "We have rejuvenated the old mine!"

  Our drive comes from: "Not for individuals,
    Not for money, only for the early realization of communism."

    How did Lifeng Mine achieve such great leap forward in production in 1958? There are three main reasons. First, it was due to the correct leadership of the Party and the implementation of putting politics in command. Through the rectification movement and the implementation of the Party's general line for building socialism, a struggle between the two roads and two methods of socialism and capitalism, and of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results versus lesser, slower, worse, and more expensive results was carried out among all employees, and various right-leaning conservative ideas were criticized. The workers' communist consciousness was greatly improved. With the attitude of masters of the country, they demonstrated a high degree of perseverance and wisdom in their work. What they thought, said, and did were all for the great leap forward in production, for supporting steel production, and for the early construction of socialism. Last year, a slogan circulated among the workers: "Not for individuals, not for money, only for the early realization of communism." This is the source of strength for all our achievements. Second, a mass technical revolution movement was launched, advocating hard work, practical work, skillful work, and safe production, and many new coal mining methods were created and promoted. Such as "Stepped Middle and Lower Layer Simultaneous Mining Method," "Multi-Face Fast Coal Mining Method,"
  "Fast Moving Groove and Concentrated Blasting,"
  "Four-Shift Parallel Operation,"
  "Increase Mining Height and Width" and other advanced working methods, which increased production efficiency by 80 to 100 percent or more, and saved a lot of materials and funds. For example, before September last year, our coal mining team's average monthly output was only 15,000 to 16,000 tons. After adopting the "Middle and Lower Layer Simultaneous Mining Method," the output in September and October reached 30,000 to 35,000 tons, and in November it jumped to 38,900 tons, an increase of nearly 50 percent compared to before September. According to incomplete statistics, during the technical revolution movement, employees throughout the mine put forward more than 6,200 rationalization proposals, which greatly promoted the development of the technical revolution movement. Third, a socialist labor competition to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and surpass the advanced was launched, and many moving hero models emerged. Last year, the entire mine selected 739 advanced producers and 41 advanced pacesetters, accounting for 29 percent of the total number of employees. "Striving for the upper reaches and striving for first place" has become the action slogan of every worker.

    First quarter production, rising month by month;
        Greater leap forward, will certainly be realized

    Although we achieved great results in 1958, we are not satisfied with the status quo. Especially after the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the four major production targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton for 1959 to the people of the whole country in November last year, we felt that the responsibility of our coal mine workers was even greater. We are determined to strive for the upper reaches to a greater extent, leap forward again, and produce more and better raw coal for the motherland to support national industrialization and meet the needs of the people's lives. After full discussion by the workers, the production plan for our Lifeng Mine in 1959 was determined to be 1.75 million tons, an increase of 70 percent over 1958. We have firm confidence and sufficient conditions to achieve this greater leap forward plan. From January to now, production has been rising step by step. The average daily output in March was 3,500 tons, an increase of 13.24 percent over February; the average daily output in early April was 4,300 tons, an increase of 22.8 percent over March. Therefore, we won the title of "Red Flag Mine" in the province. Now, a larger-scale and higher-momentum great leap forward upsurge has been fully and deeply launched in Lifeng Mine.

    In this even greater great leap forward upsurge this year, we have mainly grasped the following five measures:

    First, strengthen ideological and political work, further improve the political consciousness of workers, and formulate a good production leap forward plan. When formulating this year's leap forward plan, the Party branch mobilized all workers and held more than 20 meetings of various sizes to carry out heated discussions. In the beginning, some people raised difficulties such as "high yield can only be achieved by shock work, not sustained," "equipment is outdated, transportation distance is long, and mechanical and electrical accidents are prone to occur," and "the underground water is large, there is a lot of gas, and the roof is thick," thinking that production can only be "slowly" and advocating "trickle irrigation." Most people believed that difficulties could be overcome and that a great leap forward could still be achieved. After a heated debate of carefully calculating accounts, explaining principles, and presenting conditions, everyone unanimously believed that it was entirely possible to achieve the production task of 1.75 million tons of raw coal this year. And it was believed that there were four fundamental conditions for completing this year's leap forward plan: First, there is the strong leadership of the Party, the workers have a high level of consciousness and are full of energy, and they have gained rich experience from last year's great leap forward. Second, since November last year, new coal mining methods have been adopted, and the mining efficiency has more than doubled compared to before November last year. Therefore, this year the mine not only does not need to increase workers, but also transferred more than 400 people to support the new mining area. Third, the underground transportation system has been greatly improved compared to last year. The transportation speed of electric chutes, conveyor belts, and coal buckets has increased by more than 100 percent compared to last year. Fourth, the hoisting equipment on the mine has been greatly improved. In the past, the main shaft could only hoist 0.8 tons each time, but now it can hoist 2.2 tons each time, and the wind shaft is also used to hoist coal. In this way, with the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the workers, more coal can be mined, it can be transported quickly underground, and it can be hoisted more at the mine, so we have enough confidence to complete the task of 1.75 million tons this year. As for the problems of insufficient equipment, large water, large gas, and thick roof, as long as efforts are made, these difficulties can be completely overcome. After this round of investigation, calculation, and discussion by the workers, the plan truly became the action program of the workers, and they were more energetic and more motivated. The workers said: "After the debate, our thinking is clear and we have a clear understanding."

    Second, the mass technical revolution movement with mining as the center was carried out in depth, and advanced mining methods such as "multi-layer double mining" and "top-layer multi-eye mining" were vigorously promoted. A total of 59 important technical transformation plans were formulated in the entire mine, and 21 of them have now been realized. At the same time, workers were mobilized to make their own machinery and equipment to solve the difficulty of insufficient machinery and equipment. Now 80 mine cars, 12 various machines and equipment, and 1,150 production tools such as iron hoes have been manufactured. In addition to carrying out technical reforms in a planned way, for temporary problems that arise in production, workers were also mobilized in a timely manner to think of ideas, find tricks, and quickly solve them. For example, as production increased, mechanical and electrical accidents increased. The workers came up with a way to change the turning roadway on the winch slope into a flat roadway. As a result, not only were accidents reduced, but also four electric chutes were saved.

    Third, the red flag competition movement was vigorously launched. Labor competitions were launched between teams, between classes, between groups, and between individuals, forming an enthusiastic competition upsurge of you chasing me and me chasing you. In the movement, everyone strove to be first, and everyone showed their strength, and no one was willing to show weakness. For example, the competition opponent of our coal mining team is the "May Fourth" coal mining team. The workers said: "We will not give up if we can't plant the red flag, and we will take the red flag and plant it to the end!" Due to mutual promotion and mutual encouragement, our two teams reached the national coal mine high-yield working face competition target in March. After the competition movement was launched, more and more hero models emerged. The entire mine has now emerged two red flag areas, 18 advanced groups, and 253 advanced individuals. Our current action slogan is: "Prepare greatly in March, surpass Wangfeng (mine) in April, produce 5,500 (tons) per day in May, vow to win the first place in the city, and strive to enter Beijing for the National Day this year."

    Fourth, leading cadres go deep into the production process, participate in production labor, and conscientiously implement the industrial constitution of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." More than 20 leading cadres in the entire mine have participated in production labor. In their work, they have grasped the key to production such as overhauling roadways and adjusting electric chutes, which has effectively promoted production and encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. The workers said: "Cadres can go to sea, we can capture dragons. With good leaders who know our hearts, we are ten times more motivated to work." As a result, a new situation of unity, closeness, and friendship between cadres and workers has emerged.

    Fifth, implement the principle of "walking on two legs," use both foreign and local methods, and exploit small coal kilns. With the support of large mines, we have successively opened three pairs of small coal kilns. This kind of small kiln requires less investment and yields quick results. After all three pairs of small kilns are put into production, the daily output can reach more than 1,400 tons.

    Comrades representatives, we have won the first round of victory in the struggle to achieve a greater leap forward in coal production this year. However, there are still many difficulties for us to overcome on the road ahead, and there are still some shortcomings in our work. Therefore, we must continue to work hard, muster greater energy, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, conscientiously and humbly learn from fraternal coal mines across the country, and use practical actions to complete and overfulfill the 1959 production plan to present a gift to our great leader Chairman Mao and to the 10th anniversary of our great motherland's National Day!

    The above speech is for criticism and correction by all representatives.

    我们使古老的矿井返老还童
    刘九学代表谈焦作煤矿李封矿井的生产跃进主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意大会的各项报告，并愿在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    我现在向大会汇报一下河南省焦作煤矿李封矿井一九五八年原煤生产大跃进的成就，和一九五九年更大跃进的行动情况。
    李封矿井，是一个有四十多年历史的老井。过去人们常常说它“井大没煤，到处出水”，不要说搞什么生产大跃进了，就是保持原来的生产水平，也有一些人对它抱着悲观的看法。但是，在一九五八年，我们打破了这个迷信。在共产党、毛主席的英明领导下，在全国工农业生产大跃进的推动下，通过伟大的整风运动，全体职工发挥了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，冲破了右倾保守思想和一些不合理的规章制度的束缚，工人们以冲天的革命干劲和高度的劳动智慧，使原煤增产再增产，劳动效率提高再提高。一九五八年全矿共生产原煤一百零三万吨，比一九五七年增长百分之六十八点三二，超过国家计划百分之六十六；全员效率比一九五七年提高百分之三十四点八五；原煤成本比一九五七年降低百分之十一点五八。去年李封一对矿井的产量，就等于解放前整个焦作煤矿二年的产量！工人们高兴地说：“我们使古老的矿井返老还童了！”
  我们的干劲来自：“不为个人
    不为钱，只为共产主义早实现。”
    李封矿一九五八年生产大跃进的成绩是怎样得来的呢？主要原因有三。第一，是由于党的正确领导，实行了政治挂帅。通过整风运动和贯彻执行党的建设社会主义的总路线，在全体职工中开展了社会主义与资本主义、多快好省与少慢差费的两条道路和两种方法的斗争，批判了各种右倾保守思想，工人们的共产主义觉悟大大提高。他们以国家主人翁的姿态，在劳动中表现了高度的毅力和智慧，他们所想的、讲的和做的，都是为了生产大跃进，为了支援钢铁生产，为了早日建成社会主义。去年在工人中流传着一句口号：“不为个人不为钱，只为共产主义早实现。”这就是我们取得一切成就的力量源泉。第二，开展了群众性的技术革命运动，提倡苦干、实干、巧干和安全生产，创造和推广了许多新的采煤方法。如“台阶式中底层同时回采法”、“多面快速采煤法”、
  “快速移槽及集中放炮”、“四班平行作业”、
  “加大采高采宽”等先进工作方法，使生产效率提高了百分之八十到一倍以上，并且节约了大量的材料和资金。再如我们的采煤队，在去年九月以前，每月平均产量只有一万五、六千吨，采用了“中底层同时回采法”以后，九、十两个月的产量即达到三万至三万五千吨，十一月更跃进到三万八千九百吨，比九月以前提高了将近一倍半。据不完全的统计，在技术革命运动中，全矿职工共提出各种合理化建议六千二百多条，大大促进了技术革命运动的开展。第三，开展了学先进、比先进、超先进的社会主义劳动竞赛，出现了很多动人的英雄模范。全矿去年共评选出先进生产者七百三十九人，先进标兵四十一人，占职工总数的百分之二十九。“争上游，争第一”已经成为每一个工人的行动口号。
    首季生产，月月上升；
        更大跃进，定能实现
    我们在一九五八年虽然取得了很大的成绩，但是，我们并不满足现状。特别是去年十一月中共八届六中全会向全国人民提出了一九五九年钢、煤、粮、棉四大生产指标以后，更感到我们煤矿职工的责任重大。我们决心力争上游更上游，跃进再跃进，为祖国生产出更多更好的原煤，支援国家工业化，满足人民的生活需要。一九五九年我们李封矿的生产计划，经过工人的充分讨论，确定为一百七十五万吨，比一九五八年增长百分之七十。实现这个更大的跃进计划，我们有着坚强的信心和足够的条件。从元月到现在，生产步步上升，三月份平均日产三千五百吨，比二月份增长百分之十三点二四；四月上旬平均日产四千三百吨，又比三月份增长了百分之二十二点八。因而获得了全省“红旗矿”的称号。现在，一个规模更大、声势更高的大跃进高潮，已经在李封矿全面深入地展开了。
    在今年这个更大的大跃进的高潮中，我们主要抓住了以下五个措施：
    第一，加强思想政治工作，进一步提高工人的政治觉悟，制订好生产跃进规划。在制订今年跃进规划时，党支部发动了全体工人，连续召开了二十多次大小会议，展开了热烈的讨论。开始曾有人提出“高产只能突击，不能持久”，“设备陈旧，运输距离长，机电事故容易发生”，“井下水大，瓦斯多，岩顶厚”等等困难，认为生产只能“慢慢来”，主张“细水长流”。多数人则认为困难是可以克服的，仍然能够大跃进。经过一番热烈的算细账、讲道理、摆条件的辩论之后，大家一致认为实现今年一百七十五万吨原煤的生产任务是完全可以做到的。并且认为，完成今年跃进计划的根本条件有四条：首先，有党的坚强领导，工人同志们的觉悟高，干劲足，并且有了去年大跃进的丰富经验。其次，去年十一月以来，采用了新的采煤方法，采掘效率比去年十一月以前提高了一倍以上。因而今年矿上不但不需要增加工人，并且还抽出了四百多人支援新矿区。其三，井下运输系统比去年有了很大改进，电溜子、传送带、煤斗子的运输速度已经比去年提高了一倍多。其四，井上的提升设备有了很大改进，主井过去每次只能提升零点八吨，现在每次可提升二点二吨，并且还利用了风井提煤。这样，有了党的领导，有了工人的努力，煤能够多挖，井下能够快运，井上又能够多提升，所以，我们有足够的把握来完成今年一百七十五万吨的任务。至于说设备不足、水大、瓦斯大、岩顶厚等问题，只要经过努力，这些困难都是完全可以克服的。经过工人们这一番查算讨论之后，使计划真正变成了工人们的行动纲领，干劲更大、更足了。工人们说：“经过辩论，思想亮堂了，心里有数了。”
    第二，深入开展了以采掘为中心的群众性的技术革命运动，大力推广了“多层双开采”
  “顶层多眼开采”等先进采掘方法。全矿共制订了五十九项重要的技术改革规划，现在已经实现了二十一项。同时，发动工人自制机器设备，解决机器设备不足的困难。现在已经制造了矿车八十辆，各种机器设备十二部，铁铣等生产工具一千一百五十件。除了有计划地进行技术改革外，对于生产中临时出现的问题，也及时发动工人，想计策，找窍门，迅速作了解决。如生产增加以后，机电事故增多，工人们就想办法把绞车上坡的拐弯巷道改成平巷，结果不但减少了事故，而且还节约了四部电溜子。
    第三，大力地开展了红旗竞赛运动。展开了队与队、班与班、组与组、人与人之间的劳动竞赛，形成了你追我、我赶你热情洋溢的竞赛高潮。在运动中，人人争先，个个逞强，谁也不肯示弱。如我们采煤队的竞赛对手是“五四”采煤队，工人们表示：“插不上红旗不泄气，夺来红旗插到底！”由于互相推动互相鼓励，我们两个队在三月份都达到了全国煤矿高产工作面的竞赛指标。在竞赛运动开展起来以后，英雄模范愈来愈多，全矿已出现了两个红旗区，十八个先进组，二百五十三个先进人物。我们现在的行动口号是：“三月大准备，四月超王封（矿井），五月日产五千五（百吨），誓夺全市第一名，争取今年国庆进北京。”
    第四，领导干部深入生产过程，参加生产劳动，认真执行了“两参、一改、三结合”的工业宪法。全矿已有二十多个领导干部参加了生产劳动，在劳动中抓住了生产中大修巷道、调整电溜子等生产关键，有力地推动了生产，鼓舞了群众的生产热情。工人们说：“干部能下海，我们能擒龙，有了知心的好领导，做活的干劲大十倍。”因而，出现了干部和工人团结、亲密、友爱的新局面。
    第五，贯彻执行用“两条腿走路”的方针，以洋带土，开采小煤窑。在大矿井的支援下，我们先后开办了三对小煤窑。这种小煤窑，投资少，收效快。三对小窑全部投入生产以后，日产量可以达到一千四百多吨。
    各位代表，我们在争取今年煤炭生产更大跃进的斗争中，已经取得了第一个回合的胜利。但是，在前进的道路上，还有许多困难要我们去克服，而且在我们的工作中还存在着一些缺点，因此，我们必须继续努力，鼓足更大的干劲，戒骄戒躁，认真地、虚心地向全国各兄弟煤矿学习，用完成和超额完成一九五九年生产计划的实际行动，来向我们伟大的领袖毛主席，向我们伟大的祖国国庆的十周年献礼！
    以上发言，请各位代表批评指正。
