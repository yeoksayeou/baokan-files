Chairman, fellow committee members:

Attending this CPPCC meeting and attending the NPC meeting as a non-voting delegate, and listening to several programmatic reports of great importance, especially Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, was, for me, as it was for many others, a great encouragement and an unforgettable education. This has been of great help in raising political awareness, consolidating and firming up our stance, and clarifying policies and the situation. I will implement it in my actual words and deeds.

This meeting of ours marks the great unity and solidarity among all regions and professions across the country, especially among all ethnic groups. We firmly oppose any force that attempts to undermine such great unity and solidarity.

I will speak in three parts below:

I. Source of Wealth (Economy and Technological Reform)

A grand vision has unfolded before our eyes. This is exciting, but it requires everyone's efforts. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report: "...attention should be paid to economy,...opposing any waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources of the commune...no matter how great a harvest we have obtained,...we should use grain in a planned way and oppose wasting grain." I have heard that many places have not planned well the grain after the harvest. Some places even shouted "Eat your fill," which is very inappropriate. We must know that although the source is not small, we must still prevent loss, otherwise it is still easy to dry up. Production should be as fast as possible, but use should be relatively slow. "He who makes it quickly, and he who uses it slowly, then wealth is always sufficient." This seems to be an unbreakable way to make money, and it is still worth our deep understanding and keeping in mind. I think that although Vice Premier Li specifically refers to agricultural products here, it also applies to all aspects.

At this stage, increased production mainly depends on enthusiasm, but there must also be appropriate measures, such as arrangements and dispatching, and the promotion of effective experience. We must work hard and do practical work, and we also require skillful work. The importance of technological innovation will become more and more significant in the future.

Speaking of technological reform. This is about the development and economy. Labor productivity must be actively improved, and labor intensity should be gradually reduced. The economy of manpower and the utilization of time are important. Therefore, technological reform has far-reaching significance. Agricultural tools must be mechanized or semi-mechanized. We must also climb to the peak of science from a deep scientific theoretical foundation, and then serve the working people. We must achieve "twice the result with half the effort," and gradually achieve the work efficiency of "if others can do it once, I can do it a hundred times, if others can do it ten times, I can do it a thousand times." As shallow as the fresh use of the lever principle, as precise as the control and drive of atoms and electrons, a technological reform, a scientific invention or discovery, is beneficial to human happiness, helps economy, and helps production, which is of great benefit.

We are all excited to see the prosperity of treasures, but the development of the most important treasures lies in the enlightenment of human intelligence. This is especially the responsibility of our educators. Not only in universities, but even in primary schools and kindergartens, even the smallest seedlings of wisdom are worth nurturing. We must especially guide young people to familiarize themselves with the principles of machinery, inspire their curiosity, encourage their creativity, and observe things from a fresh perspective. This resource—the fountain of wisdom—is inexhaustible.

II. Education Revolution (Combining Education and Productive Labor, Criticism of Teaching and Academic Thought)

In the past year, on the education front, as on other fronts, everyone has clarified the necessity of the Party's leadership, and everyone has also studied Chairman Mao's education policy. From universities to primary schools, the combination of education and production has been implemented. This is a great revolution in education and an epoch-making event in the history of education. I recently wrote several poems after the leap forward conference at Hangzhou University, one of which talked about productive labor, as follows:

	Spring is warm and flowers are blooming, people's hearts are like fire red.
	The stove is blue to refine the soul, doing clever work to seize the workmanship of nature.
	Learning to cultivate from the field father, taming cattle to imitate the cowherd.
	Talent is seen in hands and feet, a smile at the empty Confucian.

I think that only by combining with productive labor can education have content, and only then can the educated have a pair of hands and feet to create more and better new things.

Of course, at the beginning, there may be too much labor, and there may be overcorrection. But recently it has been gradually corrected. In Premier Zhou's report, in the section on culture and education, it said: "The research of basic theory has a profound impact on the development of science and technology, and must be given sufficient attention." This is indeed very necessary for long-term interests.

A few months ago, during the process of criticizing teaching ideology and academic thought in the Department of Education of Hangzhou University, my thinking was not without knots. But I soon felt that the criticism was beneficial to me. My attitude can be reflected in the following three four-character poems that I can still remember:

	(1) "Like cutting like grinding, like carving like polishing." Beautiful jade gradually appears, benefiting me a lot.
	(2) "I love my teacher, but I love the truth even more." What concerns the truth, how can debate be stopped?
	(3) "Blue comes from blue, but is better than blue." Generations surpass each other, exploring the laws of the sky.

Let teachers and students learn from each other! No one should be complacent.

III. Several Poems (Including Theater Subtitles)

In my speech at the CPPCC meeting in 1957, I talked about the best way to display subtitles for theater lyrics, so that the audience can easily understand.

Many committee members expressed their strong agreement with my proposal. This year, when I came to Beijing, I saw that every performance used subtitles for the lyrics. I believe this meets the needs of the masses. But as far as I know, some local opera troupes, such as Yue Opera and Peking Opera in Hangzhou, still do not use subtitles (the Kun Opera Troupe in Zhejiang was the first to use subtitles, and Wuju—that is, Jinhua Opera—also uses subtitles). I hope that the cultural bureaus and troupes in various places can pay attention to this matter. I believe that the use of subtitles can enhance the audience's understanding of the drama; for the troupes themselves, it is only beneficial and harmless. This method can even be extended to other singing.

This year is the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China. Countless heroes and talents are devoting their talents to contribute to the country, and will present gifts together on the National Day. The beautiful scenery in front of us is encouraging. Here, I would like to write three of my humble poems as a prelude!

	Song of the Dragon and Phoenix
		(1)
	Long dormant, rising one morning, the dragon flies and the world is shocked.
	Riding the wind, only a year old, it strides ten thousand miles across the clouds.
		(2)
	The phoenix soars in the sunshine, its brilliance moves the nine continents.
	Dongting Zhang Guang is happy, singing prosperity and waiting for the high autumn.
		(3)
	Building the country is like the morning sun, the whole people are working hard together.
	All nations look forward, the phoenix dances and the dragon flies again.

### 从财富源流和教育革命说到剧场字幕和诗歌  郑晓沧委员的发言

专栏：

    从财富源流和教育革命说到剧场字幕和诗歌
    郑晓沧委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    这次出席政协会议和列席人大会议，听了几个关系十分重要的纲领性的报告，特别是周总理的政府工作报告，对我来说，像对许多人一样，是一种极大的鼓舞，和一次难忘的教育。这对政治思想的提高，立场的巩固坚定，和对政策形势的明了，都有极大帮助。我将于实际言行中去贯彻。
    我们这次会议标志着全国各地区、各专业，尤其是各民族间伟大的统一和团结。我们坚决反对任何势力来图谋毁损这样伟大的统一和团结。
    以下我分三段说：
    一、财富源流（节约和技术改革）
    宏伟远景已展开在我们的眼前。这使人兴奋，但还得大家努力。李富春副总理在报告里说：“……应当注意节约，……反对对公社人力、物力、财力作任何的浪费……无论我们得到了多大的丰收，……都应当有计划地使用粮食和反对浪费粮食。”我听说有不少地方丰收后对粮食的掌握欠有计划。甚至有些地方喊出“放开肚皮吃饭”，这是很不妥当的。须知来源虽已不小，流失仍须防备，否则仍是容易枯竭的。生产无论如何捷速，使用还得相当舒缓。“为之者疾，用之者舒，则财恒足矣。”这像是一条颠扑不破的生财大道，还是值得我们深深领略，牢记在心的。我想李副总理这里虽然特别指着农产品说，但也适用于各方面的。
    在现阶段增产主要靠干劲，但也要有适当的措施，如安排调度，推广有效经验等。我们必须苦干实干，我们也要求巧干。技术革新的重要性，以后将更益显著。
    说到技术改革。这是有关于开发与节约的两端的。劳动生产率必须积极提高，而劳动强度要宜设法逐步减轻。人力的节约，时间的利用都是重要的。所以技术改革是具有深远的意义的。农具须得机械化或半机械化。我们也必须从深厚的科学理论基础以攀到科学顶峰，转而为劳动人民服务。我们必须做到“事半功倍”，必须渐渐达到“人一能之，己百之，人十能之，己千之”的工作效率。浅如杠杆原理的新鲜使用，精如原子电子等的宰制驱使，一项技术的改革，一种科学的发明或发现，有造于人类幸福，有助于节约的，有助于生产的为利至溥。
    我们见到宝藏的繁兴，没有不感到兴奋的，可是最重要的宝藏的开发，尤在于人智的启牖。这尤其是我们教育工作者的责任。不但在高等学校里，即使在小学和幼儿园里，一点点微小的智苗，都是值得培护的。我们尤须导引青少年使他们熟习机械的原理，启发他们的好奇心，鼓励他们的创造性，从新鲜的角度去观察事物，这一资源——智泉——乃是无尽藏的。
    二、教育革命（教育和生产劳动相结合，教学和学术思想的批判）
    一年来教育战线上，正如在其他战线上一样，大家明确了党领导的必要，大家也学习了毛主席的教育方针。从大学到小学，贯彻了教育和生产相结合。这是教育上大革命，是教育史上划时代的大事。我最近在杭州大学跃进大会后，曾有几首诗，其中之一谈到生产劳动事，如下：
    春暖花开日，人心似火红。炉青炼壮魄，干巧夺天工。
    学稼师田父，驯牛效牧童。经纶见身手，一笑腐儒空。
    我想只有和生产劳动相结合，才使教育有了内容，才使教育出来的人具有一付身手去创造出更多更好的新事物。
    当然，在开始时容有劳动分量过多，容有矫枉过正之处。但最近已渐渐修正。周总理的报告里，于文教一段，说道：“基础理论的研究，对于科学技术的发展具有深远的影响，必须给以足够的重视。”这为长久利益计，确也是十分必要的。
    数月前杭州大学教育系在教学思想和学术思想批判过程中，我的思想不是没有疙瘩的。但我不久便也感觉到那次批判对我是有益处的。我的态度，可从我现在还能记到的以下三首四言诗里反映出来：
    （一）“如切如磋，如琢如磨。”美玉渐呈，益我良多。
    （二）“我爱我师，尤爱真理。”真理所关，辩何能己？
    （三）“青出于蓝，而胜于蓝”。代胜一代，规律穹探。
    让师生们相互学习吧！没有人是应该可以自满的。
    三、几首诗歌（兼及剧场字幕）
    一九五七年政协会议上我的发言里，谈到剧场歌词最好能用字幕映出，以便使听众容易了解。
    不少委员对我此议深表赞同。今年我来北京，看到每场演出，对于歌词都用字幕，我相信这是符合群众要求的。但据我所知，有些地方剧团，例如在杭州的越剧，京剧，还有不采用字幕办法的（浙江的昆剧团最先用字幕，婺剧——即金华戏——也用字幕的）。我希望各地文化局和剧团能对此事予以注意。我相信，使用字幕可以增进观众对戏剧的了解；对剧团本身来说，也只有利益而无所妨害的。这一方法，甚至可以推广到其他的歌唱。
    今年是新中国建国十周年。无数英雄俊杰正在奋其才略以贡献于国家，将在国庆一齐献礼。美景当前，令人鼓舞。我在此谨写上拙作诗歌三首聊当喤引！
          龙凤歌
            （一）
    久蛰一朝起，龙飞世尽惊。
    乘风才匝岁，万里迈云程。
            （二）
    凤翥朝阳里，光辉动九州。
    洞庭张广乐，鸣盛待高秋。
            （三）
    兴国如朝旭，全民奋力齐。
    万邦翘首望，凤舞又龙飞。
