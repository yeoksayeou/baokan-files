    “Stress the Present, De-emphasize the Past”
    Cheng Yu Si
    In academic research, the so-called "stress the present" is relative to "de-emphasize the past." In a relative sense, our general attitude towards the "present" is "thicker" than towards the "past"; that is, we should use our main efforts to study current issues. But don't take "stress the present" absolutely. Advocating "stress the present" does not mean forgetting the "past"; studying the "past" does not necessarily mean de-emphasizing the "present." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To clear away the dross of the feudalism that has accumulated in the course of development of ancient culture, and to assimilate its democratic essence is a necessary condition for developing new national culture and increasing national self-confidence." For ancient things, removing the dross and absorbing the essence is for the purpose of developing national culture and enhancing national self-confidence. This is called learning from the past to serve the present, making the past serve the present, which is also a kind of "stressing the present." On the other hand, should all aspects of the "present" be "stressed"? Of course not. Even within the "present," based on different needs, there will be varying degrees of emphasis. Some people may stress this and de-emphasize that, while others may stress that and de-emphasize this. For example, when going to a people's commune, economics students may be more concerned about the commune's accumulation and consumption issues, while education students may be more concerned about the commune's literacy campaigns and nurseries. Paying more attention is a form of "stressing." Paying less attention is a form of "de-emphasizing."
    The so-called "de-emphasize the past" is relative to "stress the present." In a relative sense, our general attitude towards the "past" is "thinner" than towards the "present"; that is, we can only use less effort to study those issues that are not currently urgently needed. But don't take "de-emphasize the past" absolutely. "De-emphasizing the past" does not mean that we can disrespect the ancients. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "China's long feudal society created a brilliant ancient culture." The saying that "half of the Analects can govern the country" is of course nonsense, but the Analects still provides us with rich materials for studying the politics, economy, culture, and education under the feudal system. If we look down on the "ancient" people because of the achievements of modern people (these achievements are indeed great and brilliant), then it is not right. We must break the superstition of the "ancient" people, but we "must respect our own history and never cut off history." Of course, this respect "gives history a certain scientific position, respects the dialectical development of history, and is not to praise the past and denigrate the present, nor to praise any feudal toxins." We do not "de-emphasize" all "ancient" things; the "past" has both essence and dross, and we take its essence and remove its dross. Similarly, even within the essence of the "past," there will be varying degrees of "emphasis" and "de-emphasis" depending on the needs. Out of one need, one may emphasize this and de-emphasize that, while out of another need, one may emphasize that and de-emphasize this. For example, the same book "Water Margin" is "stressed" more by people who study literary history than by people who study economics, and the same fossil is "stressed" more by people who study archeology than by people who study foreign languages.
    Therefore, "stress the present and de-emphasize the past" as a general principle of social science must be adhered to, but what should be "stressed" and what should be "de-emphasized" requires concrete analysis, and the issue should not be made absolute.

    “厚今薄古”
    成于思
    在学术研究中，所谓“厚今”，是与“薄古”相对而言。在相对的意义上说，我们对于“今”的一般态度比对“古”要“厚”些；就是说要以主要力量去研究当前的问题。但不要把“厚今”理解绝对了。提倡“厚今”，并不是要人忘“古”；学“古”也不一定就是薄“今”。毛泽东同志说：“清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件”。对于古代的东西，剔除其糟粕，吸收其精华，目的是为了发展民族文化，提高民族自信心。这叫做学古为今，使古为今用，也就是一种“厚今”。另一方面，是不是所有的“今”，一律都要“厚”呢？当然不是。同样是“今”，从不同的需要出发，对它也会有厚有薄，某些人可能厚此薄彼，某些人可能会厚彼薄此。例如到人民公社去，经济系学生可能更关心公社的积累消费问题，教育系的学生可能更关心公社的扫盲、托儿所问题。多关心就是一种“厚”。少关心就是一种“薄”。
    所谓“薄古”，是与“厚今”相对而言。在相对的意义上说，我们对于“古”的一般态度比对“今”要“薄”些；就是说只能用较少的力量去研究那些不是当前迫切需要的问题。但又不要把“薄古”理解绝对了。“薄古”并不是说可以不尊重古人。毛泽东同志说：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化”。所谓“半部论语可以治天下”，当然是胡说，但论语这部书仍然为我们研究封建制度下的政治、经济、文化、教育提供了丰富的资料。如果我们由于今人的成就（这些成就的确是伟大的、辉煌的），而就瞧不起“古”人，那就不对了。我们要破除对“古”人的迷信，但又“必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史”。当然这种尊重，“是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建的毒素”。我们不是对所有的“古”一律都“薄”；“古”有精华，也有糟粕，我们是取其精华而去其糟粕。同样是“古”之精华，也会因需要的不同而有“厚”有“薄”。出于一种需要，可能要厚此薄彼，出于另一种需要，可能会厚彼薄此。例如同是一本“水浒”，研究文学史的人比研究经济学的人对它就要“厚”些，同是一块化石，研究考古学的人比研究外国语的人对它就会“厚”些。
    所以说，“厚今薄古”作为对社会科学的一般原则，必须坚持，但什么该“厚”，什么该“薄”，又要有具体分析，不要把问题弄绝对了。
