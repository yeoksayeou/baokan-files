Editorial: Unleash a Greater Summer Production Upsurge

	The decisive season for agricultural production—the summer production season—has arrived. Currently, all regions are making their utmost efforts, racing against time, to sow the last batch of spring seeds into the fertile soil; at the same time, the summer harvest is about to begin, and in some areas, it has already started; immediately after the summer harvest, summer planting follows closely. These three most important agricultural activities are tightly packed together, even overlapping. Doing a solid job in spring sowing, summer harvesting, and summer planting is of decisive significance for achieving this year's agricultural production tasks. We must boldly mobilize the masses and launch a greater production upsurge, winning a decisive victory in this decisive season and on these decisive agricultural activities.
	Striving for a bumper summer harvest, especially a bumper wheat harvest, is the most important aspect of summer production. As people know, fighting a good first battle in a war often has a decisive impact on the entire situation. The same is true in agricultural production. Achieving a bumper summer harvest will encourage the broad masses to be even more confident in seizing a bumper autumn harvest. Last year, under the influence of the bumper summer harvest and bumper wheat harvest, China's agricultural front launched one wave after another of production upsurges: early rice catching up with wheat, late rice surpassing mid-season rice, and the big autumn harvest surpassing the summer harvest. This experience of "promoting autumn with summer" has been valued by leading cadres in many places this year. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the broad masses of peasants have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and initiative, and everything from deep plowing in the autumn to wheat sowing to field management has been done better and more carefully than in the past. The vast majority of wheat across the country is generally growing well. Now, as long as the whole Party and the whole people work together, put in another effort, continue to strengthen field management, and do a good job in preventing natural disasters, a bumper wheat harvest is very promising.
	Regarding strengthening the later-stage management of wheat, the editorial in this newspaper on May 10th has already discussed it. It is hoped that all cadres and the broad masses in wheat-producing areas will immediately take action, and based on the wheat's growth situation, apply fertilizer where needed and irrigate where needed. Furthermore, while strengthening the later-stage management of wheat fields, start early to prepare for the wheat harvest. This is an urgent task for achieving a bumper summer harvest. This year, wheat is densely planted and growing well, and the workload in harvesting, threshing, storage, etc., has greatly increased, which requires more, improved, and more efficient harvesting tools, threshing tools, and transportation tools. Immediately preparing these tools is a major issue related to whether increased production can actually lead to a bumper harvest. Party committees at all levels must conscientiously take this issue seriously, think of every possible way, and do a good job in organizing the labor force for the summer harvest and preparing the summer harvest tools. It is necessary to ensure that wheat is harvested as soon as it ripens, and that it is harvested and threshed carefully, with clean fields and threshing grounds, and every grain is brought home, so that all the first fruits of victory on the 1959 agricultural front are obtained.
	In agricultural production, there is no harvest without sowing, and more can be harvested if more is sown and sown well. This is common knowledge that everyone knows. Therefore, while doing a good job in the summer harvest, completing the spring sowing and summer planting tasks quickly, well, and economically is an issue that should be given great attention in current agricultural production. This year, the planned target for China's grain output is 1,050 billion jin, and the planned sowing area for grain crops is 1.6 billion mu, which means that each mu must produce an average of 650 to 660 jin of grain in order to complete this year's production target. Last year, China's grain yield per unit area was more than 400 jin, which means that this year it is necessary to increase the yield by more than 50% to complete the production task. This is a great leap forward, but also an arduous task. Whether or not the great leap forward can be achieved and whether or not this year's production task can be completed, the current key lies in two aspects: one is to actively expand the sowing area, which is a prerequisite for ensuring the completion and over-completion of this year's production plan. Therefore, Party committees at all levels should earnestly lead the masses to plant all the land that can be spring sown, as long as it is within their capabilities; after the wheat harvest, all wheat stubble land that does not affect autumn wheat planting or green manure planting should also be strived to be replanted for another season of crops. This is a decisive link in completing this year's production plan for grain, cotton, oil, and other important agricultural crops, and should not be taken lightly. The other aspect is to earnestly implement the "Eight-Character Charter" and carry out a large-scale high-yield field movement to further increase the yield per unit area. Intensive cultivation will certainly greatly increase yields, and this has been proven by the facts of agricultural production over the years, especially the great leap forward of 1958, without a doubt.
	Spring sowing and summer planting work must not only guarantee quantity, but also attach great importance to quality. Only when both aspects of the work are done well will there be a solid and reliable foundation for completing this year's production tasks. In ensuring the quality of sowing, two issues need special attention: one is to be timely, and to avoid missing the farming season as much as possible; the other is to act in accordance with the "Eight-Character Charter," and not to slack off in the slightest. In the "Eight-Character Charter," many things need to be implemented before and during sowing, such as deep plowing, close planting, improved seeds, and base fertilizer. Once the opportunity is missed, it is impossible to implement them. In order to improve the quality of sowing, the most important thing at present is to mobilize the masses and do a good job in contracting production. People's communes in various places should quickly hand over the sowing area, quality requirements, output targets, and cost plans of various crops to the commune members for discussion, and formulate various contracting indicators based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and then sign contracting contracts. The output indicators for contracting should be realistic and based on the specific local conditions; technical measures should also give the contracting units greater flexibility. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the masses be mobilized to the greatest extent. As long as the enthusiasm of the broad masses is truly mobilized, the spring sowing and summer planting tasks will certainly be completed on schedule and victoriously.
	The characteristics of summer production are heavy tasks, tight schedules, and very heavy labor organization work. To ensure that summer production is orderly and to launch a high tide of mass production movement, it is necessary to quickly strengthen the leadership of Party committees at all levels. According to the instructions of the Central Committee, during this period, Party committees at all levels must shift the focus of their work to agricultural production. The first secretary of the county party committee should focus all his efforts on agricultural production, the first secretary of the prefectural party committee should spend two-thirds of his time on agricultural production, and the first secretary of the provincial party committee should spend more than half of his time on agricultural production. On the basis of strengthening Party leadership and the first secretary taking command, launch mass movements on a large scale, fully utilize the effective working methods of the mass line, hold on-site meetings, launch visits and evaluations, and engage in red flag competitions. During the busy period of the wheat harvest, it is even more necessary to mobilize all who can be mobilized, such as government agencies, schools, urban residents, and stationed troops, to participate in the work of rushing to harvest and rush to plant. We believe that as long as we launch a more vigorous and higher summer production upsurge than last year and this spring, we will surely be able to successfully complete the spring sowing and summer harvest and summer planting tasks, and we will surely be able to achieve decisive victories in this decisive season and in these decisive links, laying a solid foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

### 掀起更大的夏季生产高潮

    掀起更大的夏季生产高潮
    农业生产的决定性的季节——夏季生产季节已经到了。当前，各地正用最大的努力，与天争时，把春播最后一批种子撒入肥沃的土地；同时夏收也即将开始，而且有些地区已经开始了；夏收过后，紧接着就是夏种。这三种最重要的农事活动紧紧挤在一起，甚至交叉进行。切实做好春播、夏收和夏种工作，对于实现今年的农业生产任务，具有决定性的意义。我们一定要放手发动群众，掀起一个更大的生产高潮，在这有决定意义的季节里，在决定性的农事活动上，打一个决定性的胜仗。
    争取夏季作物大丰收，尤其是争取小麦大丰收，是夏季生产中最重要的一环。人们知道，在战争中打好第一仗，常常会对整个战局发生决定性的影响。在农业生产上也是一样，取得了夏季大丰收，就能够鼓舞广大群众更加信心百倍地去夺取秋季大丰收。去年，我国农业战线就是在夏季大丰收，小麦大丰收影响下，掀起了早稻赶小麦，晚稻超中稻，大秋超夏收的一浪高过一浪的生产高潮。这个“以夏促秋”的经验在今年已经受到许多地方领导干部的重视。在各级党委领导下，广大农民发挥了高度的劳动热情和劳动积极性，从去年秋天的深翻地到小麦播种到田间管理，都比过去做得好做得细致，全国绝大部分小麦普遍生产良好。现在，只要全党全民一齐动手，再加一把劲，继续加强田间管理，做好防御自然灾害的工作，小麦丰收是大有希望的。
    关于加强小麦的后期管理，本报5月10日的社论已经有所论述，希望产麦区的全体干部和广大群众，立即行动起来，针对小麦生长情况，该追肥的追肥，该浇水的浇水。并且在加强麦田后期管理的同时，及早动手，做好麦收的准备工作，这是当前争取夏季大丰收的一项紧急任务。今年小麦种得密，长得好，收割、打场、入仓等等方面，工作量都大大增加了，这就需要有更多的、改良的、效率更高的收割工具、脱粒工具和运输工具。立即准备好这些工具，是一个关系丰产能不能丰收的大问题。各地党委一定要认真把这个问题抓起来，想尽一切办法，作好夏收的劳动力的组织工作和夏收工具的准备工作。一定要保证作到麦子熟一片收一片，而且作到细收细打、地净场光、颗粒还家，把1959年农业战线第一批胜利果实全部拿到手。
    在农业生产上，有播种才有收获，种得多、种得好才能收得多，这是人人知道的常识。因此，在作好夏收工作的同时，多快好省地完成春播和夏种任务，就是当前农业生产上一个应该十分重视的问题了。今年，我国粮食产量的计划指标是一万零五百亿斤，粮食作物播种面积计划是十六亿亩，就是说每亩要平均产粮六百五、六十斤，才能完成今年的增产指标。而去年我国的粮食单位面积产量是四百斤以上，就是说今年需要提高产量50％以上才能完成生产任务。这是一个伟大的跃进，也是一个艰巨的任务。能不能实现伟大的跃进，能不能完成今年的生产任务，目前的关键在于两个方面：一方面是要积极扩大播种面积，这是保证完成和超额完成今年生产计划的先决条件。因此，各级党委应该认真领导群众，把一切可以春播的土地，只要力所能及的都要种上；麦收以后，凡是不影响秋季种麦、不影响种绿肥的麦茬地，也都要力争全部再种上一季庄稼。这是完成今年粮、棉、油等重要农作物生产计划有决定性的环节，不要等闲视之。另一方面要认真贯彻“八字宪法”，开展大面积丰产田运动，更大的提高单位面积产量。精耕细作，就一定可以大大提高产量，这也是历年农业生产特别是1958年大跃进的事实所证明了的，勿庸置疑。
    春播夏种工作既要保证数量，也要十分重视质量，只有两方面的工作都作好了，完成今年的生产任务才有了坚实可靠的基础。在保证播种质量方面，也有两个问题须要特别注意：一是要适时，尽可能作到不误农时；一个是要按照“八字宪法”办事，不能丝毫松懈。在“八字宪法”中，有很多是需要在播种前和播种时就要贯彻的，比如深耕、密植、优种、底肥等等，一错过时机，就没法实行了。为了提高播种质量，当前最主要的是发动群众，做好包产工作。各地人民公社应该迅速把各种作物的播种面积、质量要求、产量指标和成本计划等交给社员讨论，本着实事求是的精神订出各项包产指标，然后签定包产合同。包产的产量指标，要从当地的具体情况出发，实事求是；技术措施也要给包产单位更大的机动权。这样才能更大限度地调动起群众的积极性。只要真正把广大群众的积极性发动起来了，春播和夏种任务是一定能够按期完成，胜利完成的。
    夏季生产的特点是任务重，时间紧迫，劳动力的组织工作十分繁重。要使夏季生产有条不乱，并且掀起一个群众生产运动的高潮，就必须迅速加强各级党委的领导。根据中央的指示，在此期间，各级党委一定要把工作中心转移到农业生产方面来。县委第一书记要全力抓农业生产，地委第一书记要以三分之二的时间抓农业生产，省委第一书记也要以二分之一以上的时间抓农业生产。在加强党的领导，第一书记挂帅的基础上，大搞群众运动，充分运用行之有效的群众路线的工作方法，召开现场会议，发动参观评比，大搞红旗竞赛等等。在麦收大忙时期，更要动员机关、学校、城市居民、驻军部队等所有可以动员的人参加抢收抢种工作。我们相信，只要掀起一个比去年、比今春更大更高的轰轰烈烈的夏季生产高潮，我们就一定能够胜利完成春播和夏收夏种任务，就一定能够在这具有决定意义的季节里和决定性的环节上，取得决定性的胜利，为今年大丰收打下坚固的基础。
