    Cultural Revolution Creates Conditions for Technological Revolution
    Luoyang Vigorously Runs Staff and Workers' Spare-Time Schools
    (Our Dispatch) Luoyang City has achieved remarkable results in vigorously running staff and workers' spare-time education. At present, a total of 75,099 staff and workers in the city's factories and mines (excluding industries under the jurisdiction of various districts) are enrolled in schools, accounting for 74.7% of the total number of staff and workers. Among these staff and workers, 10,755 have a primary school level, 25,968 have a higher primary school level, 21,178 have a junior middle school level, and the rest, in addition to some who are still engaged in literacy learning, have 8,300 people who have reached the level of colleges and universities.
    Luoyang City's staff and workers' spare-time education has a grand scale. Whether it is a factory that has already been put into production or a basic construction site, national key industries, or local state-owned factories and mines, they all run staff and workers' spare-time schools. These schools have conscientiously and earnestly implemented the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor" over the past few years. Therefore, not only has the cultural and technical level of the vast number of staff and workers been greatly improved, but also great achievements have been made in technical innovation, invention and creation, and tool improvement, which has directly promoted production. Among the 197 staff and workers in the Xiguan Clothing Factory, there were 98 illiterate people in 1954, 72 with primary school level, and 27 with higher primary school level. Now all illiterate workers have shed their illiteracy, and primary and higher primary school students have generally been promoted to higher grades, with 51 promoted to the first grade of junior middle school. Comrade Wang Wujian, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, was originally illiterate. After more than four years of hard study, he has now reached the first grade level of junior middle school. The students of the Metallurgical Science Research Institute of the Tractor Factory's spare-time school have made twelve cutting-edge inventions and creations in more than half a year. Among them, the use of nodular cast iron to replace steel in manufacturing crankshafts alone can save the country 2,000 tons of steel per year, worth 3 million yuan, based on an annual output of 40,000 tractors. All the students have implemented 2,122 technical innovation proposals in their studies combined with production practice, which can save 1,240 tons of metal annually, equivalent to more than 10 million yuan in Renminbi. In order to accelerate the popularization of elementary, secondary, and even higher education, the Luoyang City education leading organs have made preliminary plans to accelerate the improvement of the cultural, technical, and political level of all staff and workers in the city. According to this plan, they have begun to establish and improve organizational structures and necessary systems, fix an appropriate number of full-time and part-time teachers, formulate teaching syllabuses, compile teaching materials, and arrange study time.

    文化革命为技术革命创造条件
    洛阳大办职工业余学校
    本报讯　洛阳市大办职工业余教育，已经取得了显著成绩。目前，全市厂矿企业职工（不包括各区所属工业）共有七万五千零九十九人入学，占全体职工总数的74.7％。在这些职工中，初小程度的为一万零七百五十五人，高小二万五千九百六十八人，初中二万一千一百七十八人，其余除了部分还在进行扫盲学习外，还有八千三百多人达到了大专学校的水平。
    洛阳市的职工业余教育，具有宏大的规模。不管是已经投入生产的工厂，或是基本建设工地，国家重点工业、地方国营厂矿等，都办有职工业余学校。这些学校，几年来切实认真地贯彻了“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针。因而，不仅大大提高了广大职工的文化、技术水平，而且在技术革新、发明创造、改良工具等方面也取得了很大的成就，直接推动了生产。西关被服厂一百九十七名职工中，1954年有文盲九十八人，初小程度七十二人，高小二十七人。到现在所有文盲职工都摘掉了文盲帽子，初、高小的学生，都普遍升了班，升到初中一年级的有五十一人。这个厂的党支部书记王武建同志，原来是文盲，经过四年多的苦学，现已达到初中一年级程度。拖拉机厂业余学校的冶金科学研究所的学员们，在半年多的时间内，就有十二项尖端发明创造，其中仅球墨铸铁代钢造曲轴一项，按年产四万台拖拉机计算，每年就可为国家节约钢两千吨，价值三百万元。全体学员，在结合生产实际的学习中已实现二千一百二十二项技术革新建议，每年可节约金属一千二百四十吨，折合人民币一千多万元。为了使初等、中等直至高等教育的加速普及，洛阳市教育领导机关已作出了加速提高全市职工文化技术政治水平的初步规划。并且根据这个规划，开始着手建立健全组织机构和必要的制度，固定适当数量的专职和兼职教师，制定教学大纲，选编教材和安排学习时间等一系列的工作。
