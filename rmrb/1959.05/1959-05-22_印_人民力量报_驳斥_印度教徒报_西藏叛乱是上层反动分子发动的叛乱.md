Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 20th. The Tamil-language daily "People's Power" stated definitively in an editorial on the 18th that the Tibetan rebellion was merely a rebellion launched by upper-class reactionaries in Tibet.

The newspaper, in discussing the Madras-based "The Hindu's" attack on the Indian Communist Party's resolution on the Tibetan issue, wrote that "The Hindu" believes the Tibetan rebellion was a national uprising. This view is based on the fact that more than 10,000 refugees have sought refuge in India. According to critics of China, the fact that so many Tibetans are seeking refuge in India cannot explain the claim that the rebellion was organized only by a minority of feudal elements.

The newspaper said, "To these critics, we would like to say this: Chiang Kai-shek, who was driven off the mainland, now controls far more supporters than 10,000, and these people 'support' him because they would face terrible reprisals if they did not."

The newspaper continued, "The Dalai Lama is surrounded by feudal lords and serf owners. They have in fact been controlling Tibetan affairs – the People's China's rule over Tibet (local) has been very lenient, surprisingly lenient. Would it be difficult for the feudal elements around the Dalai Lama to gather 10,000 people around them using this leniency? Besides, what percentage of the total population do they actually represent?"

The newspaper asked, "Should the Tibetan rebellion be called an 'international event' simply because 10,000 Tibetans have found refuge in India? Even thinking that way is shameful. Imperialists have always been thinking and talking about rebellions in socialist countries, and these rebellions are constantly organized by them through their agents. India certainly should not allow such imperialist ideas."

    印“人民力量报”驳斥“印度教徒报”
    西藏叛乱是上层反动分子发动的叛乱
    新华社新德里20日电　泰米尔文日报“人民力量报”18日在社论中肯定地指出，西藏的叛乱只是西藏上层反动分子发动的叛乱。
    这家报纸在谈到马德拉斯“印度教徒报”攻击印度共产党关于西藏问题的决议时写道，“印度教徒报”认为，西藏叛乱是民族起义。这种看法是以一万多难民在印度避难这个事实为根据的。据批评中国的人们说，这么多的西藏人要求在印度避难这一点不能解释关于叛乱只是少数封建分子组织的这一说法。
    这家报纸说，“对于这些批评家，我们想这样说：被赶出大陆的蒋介石现在所控制的支持者比一万人要多得多，这些人‘支持’他，因为他们不支持就会受到可怕的报复。”
    这家报纸又说，“达赖喇嘛受到封建主和农奴主的包围。他们实际上一直在控制西藏的事务——人民中国对西藏（地方）的政权一直是非常宽大的，宽大得令人惊奇。达赖喇嘛周围的封建分子利用这种宽大来纠集一万人在他们的周围难道会是困难的吗？再说，实际上他们在全部人口中所占的百分比又是怎样的呢？”
    这家报纸问道，“难道应当仅仅因为一万西藏人在印度得到避难而说西藏叛乱是‘国际事件吗’？那怕是这样想都是可耻的。帝国主义者一直在想到和谈到社会主义国家的叛乱，而这些叛乱是他们通过他们的代理人所不断组织的。印度肯定不应当容许这种帝国主义想法”。
