　　National Red Flag County for Medicinal Material Production

    Wuxi County, located in the eastern part of Sichuan in the Dabashan foothills, is characterized by overlapping mountains, dense forests, and limited arable land, historically making it a grain-deficient county. However, these natural conditions are suitable for the growth of medicinal materials. The county produces more than 200 kinds of medicinal materials, with Codonopsis pilosula (党参) and Chinese goldthread (黄连) being famous throughout the country.

    Since liberation, the Wuxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, has organized farmers to "vigorously develop diversified economy while prioritizing grain production." As a result, grain production has continuously increased, and by 1955, the county achieved self-sufficiency in grain. In 1958, the average grain output per person was 1,100 jin, and this year it is striving for 2,000 jin. Having enough grain makes it easier to develop a diversified economy, vigorously develop the production of medicinal materials, increase income, and improve the lives of people in the mountainous areas. The hard life of local farmers before liberation, who wore coir clothing, coir hats, and lived in caves, with the so-called "wearing yellow, no house and no grain," is gone forever. In 1958, the county further formulated a five-year plan for developing medicinal material production. Over the past year, medicinal material farms, bases, and nurseries have been established, cultivating more than 22,000 mu of medicinal materials such as Codonopsis pilosula, Chinese goldthread, Angelica sinensis (当归), and Coltsfoot flower (冬花), a tenfold increase compared to 1957. The total output value was 2.4 million yuan, a 3.4-fold increase compared to 1957. The produced medicinal materials are sold in domestic and international markets. Due to the above achievements, Wuxi County has won the honorary title of National Red Flag County for Medicinal Material Production.

    Unifying Thought, Formulating Plans

    In the spring of 1958, when the county committee decided to vigorously develop medicinal material production, some cadres had different views. Some said that with the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, developing medicinal material production would inevitably compete with agriculture for land and labor. Others said that there were many varieties of medicinal materials, complex specifications, and that the collection and cultivation techniques were not easy to master. Still others said that many medicinal materials were not valuable, had narrow sales channels, and that operating them would be difficult and unrewarding. In short, they were not promoters of developing medicinal material production. The county committee promptly pointed out that the county had 5.7 million mu of uncultivated land that could be used to grow medicinal materials, and that agricultural production, while ensuring increased grain production, could still allocate 10% of the labor force to engage in medicinal material production; the broad masses of farmers had rich experience in the collection and cultivation of medicinal materials. Therefore, as long as they relied on the leadership of the Party, followed the mass line, the problems of labor, land, and technology could be completely solved.

    When formulating the plan, the county committee first selected more than 130 cadres to form a medicinal material survey team. With the assistance of the masses, they climbed mountains and crossed rivers, traveled throughout the county, and spent 50 days investigating the county's medicinal material reserves, distribution, and development conditions. They found that there were more than 280 kinds of medicinal materials in the county, with an annual output of 56,000 dan and an output value of more than 2.5 million yuan; they also discovered excellent varieties of medicinal materials such as Gastrodia elata (大连) and Poria cocos (茯苓). These data showed the wonderful prospects for developing medicinal material production. Based on these data, the county committee formulated a production plan for the development of medicinal materials. The general policy was: "Rely on the masses, adapt to local conditions, combine large (scale) and small (scale), and take both long (perennial) and short (annual) into consideration." After the plan was announced, the broad masses of the people in the county were overjoyed and launched large-scale airing of views and debates, unanimously supporting the county committee's decision and formulating specific plans and measures for medicinal material production. The commercial departments signed contracts with the agricultural production cooperatives at that time to guarantee species and harvest, which further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the farmers.

    Reasonable Arrangement of Labor

    After the plan was finalized and distributed to the production teams, measures were immediately taken to deal with various difficulties in production. During the spring plowing period last year, when medicinal material production was carried out on a large scale, the first problem was labor. Some said: "We are not afraid of heaven, we are not afraid of earth, but we have no way to deal with labor." After the county committee conducted an on-the-spot investigation of the labor organization in the Shangba Fourth Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Bailu District, it first carried out communist education among the members, clarified their thinking, and then organized all the labor force into three teams: agriculture, industry, and sideline, according to production needs; all the young, strong, old, weak, and women were organized, and reasonable division of labor was implemented according to labor strength and technical level. In this way, the cooperative not only completed the agricultural production tasks in a timely manner, but also extracted members to collect medicinal materials in the mountains. The contradiction between labor and production was resolved. After this experience was widely and rapidly promoted throughout the district, more than 300 people were dispatched to the mountains in three days, digging up more than 18,000 jin of medicinal materials such as Codonopsis pilosula and Adenophora stricta (泡参).

　　Collecting Seeds, Imparting Techniques

    As the planting area of medicinal materials expanded, the demand for seeds also increased greatly. Because the quantity needed was large, they collected seeds everywhere in accordance with the principle of "one or two taels is not too little, thousands of jin are not too much." They mobilized the masses to collect, sell, and adjust seeds in the mountains, and sent people to buy seeds from other places. They bought a total of 120,000 jin of seeds and more than 17 million seedlings from Hubei, Shaanxi, Henan, and other parts of the province. In order to spread cultivation techniques, they carried out large-scale experimental fields, on-site meetings, training courses, technical instruction stations, and printed technical materials. They also organized farmers to learn sowing in the spring, field management in the summer, and collection and processing in the autumn and winter, according to the growing season of medicinal materials. Every commune in the county had a technical group, and every team had a technician. They strived to innovate medicinal material cultivation techniques, turning wild Fritillaria cirrhosa (贝母), Gastrodia elata, and Coltsfoot flower into domesticated ones, shortening the growth period of medicinal materials, and introducing varieties from other places. The collection of funds for medicinal material production mainly adopted the method of supporting production with production. This is what the Xianrui Commune did. The commune mobilized its members to collect medicinal materials and local products in the mountains and exchange them for cash as funds for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, and tools for medicinal material production.

    Commercial Departments Purchase on a Large Scale

    In the autumn, the county had a bumper harvest of medicinal materials. The commercial departments crossed mountains and ridges, visited door to door, scheduled times and locations, and organized vendors, residents, teachers, and medical personnel to purchase on a large scale using a combination of large and small campaigns, regardless of raw materials or finished products, large or small quantities. They also actively explored other uses for some medicinal materials with large output and small uses, such as using Goldthread to brew wine, using aged Artemisia argyi (陈艾) to refine aromatic oil, and so on. By adopting these methods, the commercial departments overfulfilled the annual purchase plan by 32%, and also enabled farmers to quickly enjoy the benefits of large-scale development of medicinal material production. Due to the implementation of various measures to develop medicinal material production, the masses were full of enthusiasm and broke through all the original plans. In 1958, the total output value of medicinal materials was 24 million yuan, and the average income per person in the county was more than 39 yuan. This has played a significant role in supporting agricultural production, improving the living standards of people in mountainous areas, and further promoting the development of medicinal material production.

    Continue to Develop This Year

    This year, the county's medicinal material production will continue to develop on the basis of last year. The planned planting area is 97,000 mu, and the total output value is striving to reach 15 million yuan. In order to achieve this plan, the county has established six specialized medicinal material communes and twenty specialized medicinal material teams. A large number of cadres in the county have been sent to the grassroots level to assist the communes in organizing production and signing contracts to guarantee species and harvest. By the end of March, the plan had been implemented to the production teams and to the fields, and more than 80,000 mu of medicinal material land had been marked and signed. At the same time, this year will use barren land and wasteland to plant 50,000 mu of Coltsfoot flower fields, 800 Codonopsis pilosula mountains, as well as continuous Honeysuckle slopes, Eucommia ulmoides mountains, and Magnolia officinalis forests. Soon, the county will see a beautiful scene depicted by the local people: high mountains and distant mountains are medicinal material mountains, barren slopes and wastelands are all medicinal material gardens. Chinese goldthread branches in the shade of the big mountain, medicinal material fields on the sunny slopes; peonies in the garden where roe deer run, honeysuckle slopes where bees rush around. A new atmosphere of colorfulness, the scenery of the mountainous area is better than that of the south of the Yangtze River.

　　荒山荒坡尽药园
　　本报记者　李策
　　全国药材生产红旗县
    四川东部大巴山麓的巫溪县，境内群山重叠，森林密布，耕地较少，历史上是个缺粮县。但是这一自然条件却适宜药材的生长，全县生产药材两百多种，党参、黄连驰名全国。
    解放几年来，中共巫溪县委根据山区特点，组织农民“在优先发展粮食的同时，大力发展多种经济”，从而粮食产量不断增加，到了1955年，做到粮食自给自足。1958年粮食产量每人平均是一千一百斤，今年力争两千斤。有了粮吃，就利于发展多种经济，利于大力发展药材的生产，增加收入，改善山区人民生活。当地农民解放以前那种穿棕衣，戴棕帽，住宿岩洞，所谓“身披一身黄，无房又无粮”的艰苦日子一去不复返了。1958年，全县进一步制定了发展药材生产的五年规划。一年来，已经建立了药材场、药材基地和苗圃，栽培了党参、黄连、当归、冬花等药材二万二千多亩，比1957年扩大十倍，总产值是二百四十万元，比1957年增长三点四倍。出产的药材销售国内外市场。由于上述成绩，巫溪县获得了全国药材生产红旗县的光荣称号。统一思想，制定规划
    1958年春天，县委决定大力发展药材生产时，部分干部一度有过不同的看法。有人说，农业在大跃进，发展药材生产势必与农业争夺土地和劳动力。有人说，药材的品种多，规格复杂、采集和栽培技术都不容易掌握。也有人说，许多药材不值钱，销路窄，经营起来吃力不讨好。总之，他们不是发展药材生产的促进派。县委及时指出，全县有五百七十万亩未开垦的土地，可以利用种植药材，农业生产在保证粮食增产的前提下，还可以抽出10％的劳动力从事药材生产；广大农民在药材的采集和栽培方面具有丰富的经验。因此，只要依靠党的领导，走群众路线，劳力、土地和技术问题，是完全可以解决的。
    县委在制订规划时，首先抽调一百三十多名干部组成药材普查大队，在群众协助下爬山涉水，走遍全县，历时五十天，调查了全县药材的蕴藏量、分布情况和发展条件。已经查出全县有药材二百八十多种，可以年产五万六千担，产值在二百五十万元以上；也发现了大连、茯苓等药材的优良品种。这些资料显示出发展药材生产的美妙远景。县委根据这些资料制定了发展药材的生产规划，总的方针是：“依靠群众，因地制宜，大（宗）小（宗）并举，长（多年生）短（一年生）兼顾”。全县广大人民在规划公布以后，欢欣鼓舞，接着掀起了大规模的鸣放辩论，一致拥护县委的决定，纷纷制定药材生产的具体规划和措施。商业部门同当时的农业生产合作社普遍签订了保种保收合同，也进一步激发了农民的生产积极性。
    合理安排劳动力
    规划定案，下达到生产队以后，就立即采取措施处理生产中的各种困难。去年春耕期间大搞药材生产，第一个问题就是劳动力问题。有人说：“天不怕，地不怕，就是劳动力无办法。”县委在白鹿区上坝第四农业生产合作社专门对劳动力组织情况作了实地考察以后，首先向社员进行共产主义教育，明确了思想，然后把全部劳动力根据生产需要，编成农业、工业和副业三支队伍；把青壮年、老弱、妇女全部组织起来，按照劳动力强弱和技术高低实行合理分工。这样，这个社不仅及时完成农业生产任务，又能抽出社员上山采集药材。劳动力与生产之间的矛盾解决了。这一经验在全区内普遍而迅速地推广以后，三天工夫，全区就出动三百多人上山，挖回党参、泡参等药材一万八千多斤。
　　搜集种子，传授技术
    药材种植面积扩大了，种子需要量也大大增加。由于要的数量很大，他们就本着“一两二两不嫌少，千斤万斤不算多”的原则，到处搜集种子。发动群众上山采集，出售和调剂，派人去外地购买。他们从湖北、陕西、河南和省内各地共买回种子十二万斤，秧苗一千七百多万株。为了传播栽培技术，他们大搞试验田、现场会、训练班、技术传授站、印发技术资料，还按照药材生长季节，组织农民春季学播种，夏季学田间管理，秋冬两季学采集和加工。全县社社有技术组，队队有技术员。他们努力革新药材栽培技术，把野生的贝母、天麻、冬花变为家种，缩短药材生长年限，接引外地品种等。药材生产资金的筹集，主要是采用以生产扶持生产的办法。咸瑞公社就是这样做的，这个社发动社员上山采集药材和土特产，换成现款，作为药材生产的购买种子、肥料和工具的资金。
    商业部门大收大购
    秋后，全县药材大丰收，商业部门就翻山越岭，挨门挨户，约时定点，不论原料或成品，大宗或小宗，组织商贩、居民、教师和医务人员采用大运动套小运动的办法大收大购。对于部分产量大、用途小的药材也积极开辟其他用途，如用金因子酿酒，用陈艾炼芳油，等等。采用这些办法，商业部门超额32％完成了全年的收购计划，也使农民迅速享受到大发展药材生产的实惠。由于实行发展药材生产的种种措施，群众干劲冲天，冲破了原订的全部规划。1958年药材总产值二千四百万元，全县每人平均收入三十九元以上。这对支援农业生产、提高山区人民生活水平和进一步推动药材生产的发展，都起了重大的作用。
    今年将继续发展
    今年全县药材生产将在去年的基础上继续发展。计划种植面积是九万七千亩，总产值力争达到一千五百万元。为了实现这一计划，全县已经建立起六个药材专业公社，二十个药材专业队。县里大批干部下放到基层，协助公社组织生产，签订保种保收合同。到3月底，计划已经落实到生产队、到田，插标定签的药材用地已达八万亩以上。同时今年将利用荒地荒坡种植五万亩冬花坪、八百座党参山，以及成片的银花坡、杜仲山、厚朴林。全县不久将出现当地人民描绘的一幅美好的情景：高山远山药材山，荒坡荒地尽药园。大山阴处黄连枝，朝阳坡上冬药田；芍药园内獐鹿跑，银花坡中蜂乱窜。万紫千红新气象，山区美景胜江南。
