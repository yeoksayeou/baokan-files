Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 1st: Approximately four million Japanese workers, farmers, and citizens held rallies and parades simultaneously in 470 locations across the country today to celebrate International Labor Day, May Day.

    In Tokyo, 300,000 workers, youth, women, students, and citizens gathered at the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden Plaza this morning for a central celebration rally. Representatives from the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party participated in the celebration rally.

    Amidst enthusiastic applause, the assembly unanimously passed four resolutions. The "Resolution on Crushing Various Reactionary Policies and Overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet" strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet for plotting to forcibly revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," pursuing a policy of hostility towards China, establishing a military alliance between Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, maliciously revising the Constitution, and implementing the "Work Performance Rating" system. The resolution stated that the Japanese working class will further unite and struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

    The "Resolution on Opposing the Revision of the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' Striving for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and Fully Recovering Territory" exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strengthen the military alliance between Japan and the United States.

    The assembly finally unanimously passed a declaration. The declaration stated that people from all walks of life participating in the assembly will unite, break through all obstacles, overcome all difficulties, and advance to realize the aforementioned resolutions. After the assembly, the 300,000 participants divided into five groups and held demonstration parades.
