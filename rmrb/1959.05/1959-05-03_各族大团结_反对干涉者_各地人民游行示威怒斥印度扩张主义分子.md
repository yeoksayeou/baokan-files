Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Yesterday, in the capitals of all autonomous regions and autonomous prefectures across the country, people of all ethnic groups held rallies and parades to celebrate the "May 1st" International Labor Day, and expressed their firm opposition to the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs.

    More than 100,000 people in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, participated in the "May 1st" demonstration. The National Unity Contingent, composed of more than 2,000 young people from various ethnic groups, proudly raised banners written in Tibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese characters protesting the Indian expansionist elements' interference in China's internal affairs, and excitedly shouted slogans such as "Tibet is an inseparable part of China, smash the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity."  Jianba Qinco and Deji Zuo Ga, two Tibetan sisters from Lhasa, said that the Indian expansionist elements said that Tibet is a "country," and we firmly oppose this shameless provocation. Tan Shengbing, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Yu Guang, First Secretary of the Xining Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated in their speeches at the meeting that people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai must resolutely use practical actions of improving all aspects of production and construction to counterattack the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements and support the Tibetan people in building a new Tibet.

    Tibetan and Han People Side-by-Side Shout Slogans to Thoroughly Eliminate the Rebellion
    In Kangding City, the capital of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, more than 7,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life held rallies and parades. The Tibetan traitorous clique had incited rebellions in the autonomous prefecture, bringing profound disasters to the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture. The Tibetan and Han people participating in the parade waved their fists and shouted: "Thoroughly eliminate the rebels!" "Support the struggle to quell the rebellion in Tibet!" In his speech at the rally, Shana (Tibetan), the head of the autonomous prefecture, used facts to expose the heinous crimes committed by the Tibetan rebel group in commanding the Khampa rebels in the autonomous prefecture. He said: In the areas where rebellions occurred, every village and every pasture has blood debts owed by the Tibetan rebel group. We clearly recognize their true faces. The rebels disguise themselves as protectors of ethnic interests, but in reality, they sell out the country for their own glory and slaughter the people. We firmly condemn the shameless acts of the Tibetan rebel group and foreign interventionists. In his speech, Shana also forcefully refuted the lies of so-called "many lamas being killed" and "temples being destroyed" with facts. He said that many temples, such as Litang Monastery, Kangning Monastery, and Sangpi Monastery, were destroyed by the rebels, but the People's Government allocated funds to help these temples to be quickly restored. Facts prove that the Tibetan rebels are the culprits who committed these crimes. Representatives of workers, farmers, and women from Kangding also spoke one after another, unanimously angrily denouncing the Tibetan traitorous group and Indian expansionist elements. Dorje, a young Tibetan farmer who was slashed twice by the rebels, said with irrepressible anger: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the help of the Han people, the Tibetan people in our autonomous prefecture have been liberated from the serf system and are living a happy life like never before. We will resolutely use practical actions to counterattack the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements who interfere in our internal affairs."

    No One Can Stop the Tibetan People From Embarking on the Road to Happiness
    100,000 people in Chengdu held a rally. Mi Jianshu, Deputy Mayor of Chengdu, called on the people of the city to quickly launch a citywide campaign to increase production and practice economy, and to strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's national economic plan. Mi Jianshu also expressed his full support for the resolutions of the National People's Congress on the Tibet issue. After the meeting, 100,000 people held high red flags, placards, and various products and charts for a grand parade. Two hundred Tibetan students in brightly colored national costumes danced their newly编的unity dance, walking in front of the Southwest Nationalities Institute team. Jiaren Yongzhong, a Tibetan girl who became a serf at the age of seven, said: No one can stop us Tibetan people from embarking on the democratic and happy socialist road. 1,500 people from all ethnic groups in Markang, the capital of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, also held a rally yesterday. Ajia (Tibetan), the head of the Benzeng People's Commune in Markang County, said at the meeting: A small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet, colluding with imperialists to split the motherland, completely violate the interests of the Tibetan people. The act of Indian expansionist elements interfering in our internal affairs will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat under the resolute counterattack of our people.

    More than 3,500 monks and laypeople from the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province held a rally in the rain on the 1st. Tibetan compatriots put on brand-new pulu (a kind of woolen fabric) and chuba (inner and outer garments), and came in droves from dozens of miles away to attend the rally. At the meeting, Wang Xueshuo, the Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, sternly refuted the fallacy of Indian expansionist elements that the Tibetan rebellion was a "nationalist sentiment," and called on the Tibetan people of the entire prefecture to unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and actively support the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. Qililamu, a Tibetan woman whose husband was killed by the Khampa rebels, used bloody facts at the meeting to denounce the lies of the so-called "nationalist sentiment" of the Tibetan rebellion by Indian expansionist elements. She said: "My husband Sunuo was an honest farmhand. At the end of 1957, we were happily welcoming democratic reform, but the reactionary elements in the upper strata would not let us turn over, they killed my husband, and cut his body into more than a dozen pieces to feed the dogs." She angrily said: "Indian expansionist elements sympathize with these reactionary elements, and are enemies of our millions of oppressed Tibetan masses." At this time, the entire venue angrily shouted: "Thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion!" "Smash the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity!" The Tibetan lama Xiangba Gengdui also used facts at the meeting to refute the slanderous accusations of foreign interventionists. After the meeting, the Tibetan people and the local garrison held a grand military-civilian get-together.

    In the border city of Kunming, a parade of 100,000 people composed of many ethnic groups such as Bai, Hui, Yi, Han, Dai, and Tibetan, held high red flags and marched forward mightily. Angry slogans such as "Oppose the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements interfering in our internal affairs" expressed the will of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas. There was a Tibetan girl named Jiazhu Lama in the team, who shouted in unison with everyone in broken Chinese. This girl is a liberated slave and is now studying medicine at Kunming Second Health School. She said, I will never allow the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements to put new shackles on my head again. The dazzling array of new products, slogans, models, and charts brought by the parade team also showed people the new achievements made by people of all ethnic groups in production, as well as the determination to implement the call of the National People's Congress to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    Use brilliant production achievements to counterattack foreign interventionists
    "May 1st" International Labor Day is also the 12th anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia, 70,000 people gathered and paraded on this day to celebrate. Workers, farmers, soldiers, cadres, students of Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Ewenki and other ethnic groups dressed in festive costumes, and lamas in cassocks, shouted slogans in the parade, enthusiastically hailed the great victory of the Party's policy of ethnic regional autonomy, and at the same time firmly opposed the imperialists and Indian expansionist elements instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs. They expressed their determination to go all out, increase production and practice economy, and build the socialist motherland more, faster, better and more economically. Ruan Muhan, the mayor of Hohhot, spoke at the celebration meeting. He praised Inner Mongolia's realization of ethnic regional autonomy under the brilliant illumination of the Party's ethnic policy over the past twelve years, and the great victory of the socialist revolution and the amazing achievements of socialist construction. He represented the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in strongly condemning the original Tibetan local government's crime of selling out ethnic interests and betraying the motherland, and the Indian expansionist elements' crude interference in China's internal affairs, and strongly protested against the Indian expansionist elements' wanton acts of insulting Chairman Mao, the great leader of our people of all ethnic groups.

    In Baotou, an emerging iron and steel base in Inner Mongolia, 130,000 people held a demonstration parade. Li Chao, the deputy general manager of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, representing the 80,000 employees who built Baogang, said at the celebration meeting that the employees of Baogang are determined to counterattack the shameless provocations of foreign interventionists with practical actions to strive for early production of iron and steel.

    More than 70,000 people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi marched in the snow on the 1st to celebrate "May 1st" Labor Day. The parade team held high placards such as "Oppose the imperialists and foreign reactionaries instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs," and carried charts and models of their production achievements achieved on the eve of "May 1st." The total industrial output value of the autonomous region and the Urumqi factories and mining enterprises in the first quarter of this year increased by 1.6 times compared with the same period last year, and now many factories and mining enterprises have overfulfilled the production plans for April. The employees of all ethnic groups expressed their determination to smash the conspiracy and provocation of the Indian expansionist elements with actions to create new production achievements.

    In Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 50,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life participated in the rally and parade yesterday. The parade teams in all directions were guided by large banners such as "Launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to overfulfill this year's industrial and agricultural production targets" and "Tibet is an inseparable part of China, smash the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity," and carried more new product models, charts, and letters of determination than in previous parades, and marched mightily to the city center.

    More than 30,000 Hui and Han people in Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, held rallies and demonstration parades. Wang Zhiqiang (Hui), Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Mayor of Yinchuan, said at the meeting: From our own historical experience, we minority nationalities deeply realize that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in the united big family of all nationalities can we prosper and develop. All acts of interfering in our internal affairs and undermining our unity will suffer a shameful defeat under the resolute counterattack of our people.

    In addition, the people of Guiyang, Harbin, Changchun, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Changsha, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Nanchang and other places also held large-scale demonstrations against imperialists and Indian expansionist elements interfering in our internal affairs while celebrating "May 1st" International Labor Day.

  “我们自治州藏族人民在毛主席领导下和汉族人民帮助下，已经从农奴制度下解放了，过着从未有过的幸福生活。我们坚决用实际行动回击帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的行为。”任何人都阻挡不了西藏

  “印度扩张主义分子同情这些反动分子，就是与我们千千万万藏族被压迫群众为敌。”这时，全场愤怒地高呼：“彻底平息西藏叛乱！”
