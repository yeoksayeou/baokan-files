Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 15th. According to the Press Trust of India, Jai Prakash Narayan, former leader of the Praja Socialist Party, said at a press conference held in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala, on the 14th that he was "not entirely satisfied" with the Indian government's handling of the so-called "Tibet issue."

He said the Indian government had made a mistake from the outset. He did not think it was right for the government to agree that China had "suzerainty" over Tibet. He said the current government policy's "inappropriateness" was due to this initial mistake.

Narayan believes that "under communist rule, there is no question of any regional autonomy." According to him, this is "because communist rule and autonomy are incompatible."

Narayan had said on April 22nd that only India could help Tibet, this "independent country," carry out "peaceful reforms." He also demanded that "someone be declared to have carried out aggression in Tibet."

    前印度人民社会党领袖继续煽风
    对印政府“处理”“西藏问题”表示不满
    新华社新德里15日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，前人民社会党领袖贾·纳拉扬14日在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅举行的记者招待会上说，他对印度政府关于所谓“西藏问题”的处理“并不完全感到满意”。
    他说，印度政府在一开头就做错了。他并不认为政府同意中国对西藏拥有“宗主权”是正确的。他说目前政府政策的“不适当”，是由于这个最初的错误造成的。
    纳拉扬认为，“在共产主义统治下，根本谈不到任何区域自治的问题”。据他说，这是“因为共产党统治和自治是不相容的。”
    纳拉扬在4月22日曾经说过，只有印度才能帮助西藏这个“独立国”进行“和平改革”。他还要求“宣布有人在西藏进行了侵略”。
