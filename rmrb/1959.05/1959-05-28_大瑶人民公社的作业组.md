The People's Commune must develop production at high speed, and it is necessary to fully mobilize and bring into play the enthusiasm of grassroots units and the broad masses of commune members under unified leadership. How to give play to the enthusiasm of grassroots units? The practice of the Da Yao People's Commune in Liu Yang, Hunan Province, in strengthening the work of the work groups is a very effective measure. We made a survey of this commune, and their practices are roughly as follows:

The Scale of the Work Group

The work group is the most basic unit that organizes labor and directly engages in production activities under the leadership of the production team. Therefore, the scale should not be too large or too small. In their discussions, they believed that: if it is too large, there will be a lot of labor, the command will not be flexible, it will be inconvenient to arrange work, and it will be difficult to combine it with the canteen and nursery; conversely, if it is too small, the manpower will not be complete, and it will not be possible to set up a production team, which will not be conducive to production. What is the proper size? According to the principle of facilitating direct work arrangement for commune members and flexible command, and according to the actual situation of each production team, the Da Yao Commune generally consists of sixteen households and twenty-five laborers in a work group. In areas where the population is relatively concentrated, a work group consists of twenty or more households, thirty-five laborers or forty laborers. In a few places where the population is scattered, a work group consists of ten or so households or six or seven households, sixteen or seventeen laborers or twelve or thirteen laborers. The advantages of this division are: First, it is convenient for the leadership of the production team. Generally, a production team is divided into five to seven work groups, which is convenient and flexible for command. Second, the work group frequently commands 20 to 30 laborers, forming a complete production team, with smooth command and flexible scheduling. It is also easy to understand the labor skills and labor attitude of the commune members in detail, which is convenient for work arrangement. Third, the scope is not large, which is convenient for combining nurseries, canteens and work groups together, so that production and life can be better combined.

After the work groups were divided, each production team then basically fixed the land, cattle, large farm tools, and labor of the work groups in order to facilitate the arrangement of production by the work groups. The production team has the right to transfer the labor force of the work group, and the work group must also obey the unified transfer; however, except for capital construction, resisting serious natural disasters, and rushing to complete certain production tasks on a team-wide scale in order to seize the season, no transfer is allowed without authorization. Fixing cattle, large farm tools, and land and assigning them to certain work groups for long-term use is not only conducive to production but also conducive to strengthening the production responsibility and financial management of the work groups.

Combining Production and Life

The work group is a production organization, the nursery (kindergarten) is a life welfare organization, and the canteen is both a life organization and an important base for developing pigs and poultry. The Da Yao Commune, with the work group as the mainstay, implemented a combination of work group, canteen, and nursery (kindergarten). Generally, one work group eats in one canteen. A few work groups with relatively scattered residences also have two stoves in one canteen and eat in two places; generally, one work group has one nursery (kindergarten). In this way, production and life can be unified under leadership, so that production and life can cooperate and coordinate with each other, which is conducive to production and also facilitates a good life. Setting up nurseries (kindergartens) by work group is also convenient for taking care of children. In this way, the work group not only became the basic combat unit that directly engaged in production, but also became the grassroots unit for managing life and managing sideline production such as pig, chicken, and duck raising in the canteen. In order to adapt to this situation, the commune universally strengthened the leadership of the work groups, selected people with good backgrounds, active work, prestige among the masses, and rich production experience and management skills to serve as work group leaders, and also selected a deputy leader who was rich in life experience and good at frugality to be in charge of collective life and the canteen's pig and chicken production. The commune also sent more than 400 cadres from production teams, brigades, and communes to concurrently serve as work group leaders.

Strengthening the Responsibility System

Strengthening the responsibility system of the work group is the most important and most basic issue in leading the work group and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the work group. To this end, they have taken a series of measures in business management:

First, the production team implements the "four fixeds" (some call it "four contracts") and "one reward" system for the work group. "Four fixeds": First, fix the output. According to the output of various crops contracted by the brigade to the production team, the production team separately contracts them to each work group. Second, fix work points. According to the work points contracted by the brigade to the production team and the tasks undertaken by each work group, the work points are contracted to the work group at one time. As for the mutual support between groups in the future, the group that is transferred in should pay the work points of the group that transferred out the labor from the contracted work of its own group. Third, fix costs. Fourth, fix quality. Regarding the issue of rewards, the general rule is that the production team will extract 50%-60% of the overproduction rewards it receives from the production brigade to reward the overproducing work groups. If the production team does not receive overproduction rewards from the brigade, overproducing work groups must still be rewarded. The source of the bonus can be solved from two aspects: First, extract 2% to 3% from the wages issued by the brigade; second, extract a portion from the income beyond the brigade's plan to reward the work group. After the work group receives the award, it must extract a portion from the reward to reward outstanding commune members; even if the work group does not receive an award, outstanding commune members must also be rewarded. The source of the bonus can be drawn from the income beyond the plan of the brigade and production team managed by the work group. The implementation of "four fixeds" and "one reward" for the work group means that after the production team contracts tasks to the brigade, the production team is responsible for the specific "four fixeds" to the work group, rather than the brigade contracting directly to the work group. After the implementation of "four fixeds" and "one reward," the production team must also arrange work section by section and assign tasks to the work group. The benefits of implementing "four fixeds" and "one reward" are: First, further strengthen the sense of responsibility of the work group; second, enable the work group to overcome reliance and be conscientious and thrifty in the use of funds; third, further play the enthusiasm of commune members and facilitate the lively development of competition between groups.

Second, implement the plan of "five fixeds to the field." After the work group accepts the tasks assigned by the production team, in order to ensure that the plan takes root on every piece of land, they fix the crops to be planted, the output, the fertilizer, the technical measures, and the work points to each piece of land. In the implementation of "five fixeds to the field," there are two indicators for output: one is the planned target, which is the target that can be achieved through maximum effort; the other is the contracted output target, which can be exceeded through effort.

Third, field management responsibility is assigned to individuals. Determine people with certain management capabilities, contract a piece of land by division, and be responsible for the management of a piece of land from beginning to end throughout the year. The responsibility of the manager is "three preventions" (prevent theft, prevent livestock, prevent natural disasters) and "three guarantees" (guarantee measures, guarantee seasons, guarantee quality). In this way, everyone has responsibility, everything is managed, and mutual inspection and supervision can ensure the quality of farm work and ensure the realization of the plan. The manager is mainly responsible for inspecting, supervising, and reporting the situation. He must be responsible for the quality of farm work to a certain extent, and he must also do some small things himself. Provide appropriate remuneration to managers and reward or punish them according to their performance.

Labor Management of the Work Group

Reasonable arrangement of the labor force is an important guarantee for completing the production plan. The methods of arranging the labor force in each work group are roughly three types depending on the nature of various farm works: The first is continuous work with greater technical requirements and no delay of seasons, such as pig raising, cattle raising, water watching, vegetable planting, field management, cooking in the canteen, and taking care of children, which are implemented by means of year-round contracting to individuals. The second is seasonal contracting, and the third is short-term temporary work arrangement. This mainly refers to work with strong seasonality such as rice transplanting and harvesting.

The work group evaluates work points according to quotas and implements the principle of distribution according to work.

Scope of Operation of the Work Group

The most important and basic task of the work group is to ensure the completion of the production tasks assigned by the production team. In addition to this, the work group also manages the following productions: First, the canteen raises pigs. Raising pigs in the canteen is a major link in the current commune's development of pig production. At the same time, raising pigs in the canteen is also included in the production team's plan, but the production team implements the "four fixeds" and "one reward" for the work group according to the plans of the commune and the brigade. The "four fixeds" are: determine the annual pig production plan, purchase quotas, determine the labor force according to the annual production plan, determine the feed land and determine the feed. The reward is to implement overproduction commission rewards according to the purchase indicators. For the pigs that are slaughtered after the work group completes the purchase task, a proportional division is implemented. A small part belongs to the production team or brigade (mainly the production team), and most of it belongs to the work group. The pigs obtained by the work group can be sold to the state or eaten by themselves. Second, in addition to the chicken and duck farms run by the brigade and the commune, the production team proposes indicators for developing poultry to the work group, and the income, except for a small amount to be turned over to the production team, basically belongs to the work group. Third, sporadic land and sideline businesses that are difficult to include in the plans of the commune and production team are handed over to the work group for full utilization, and the income basically belongs to the work group, and only a small amount is turned over to the production team.

    大瑶人民公社的作业组
    本报记者  李沁沅
    人民公社要高速度地发展生产，必须在统一领导下充分发挥和调动基层单位和广大社员群众的积极性。怎样发挥基层单位的积极性呢？湖南浏阳大瑶人民公社加强作业组的工作的做法是一种很有效的措施。我们到这个公社作了一次调查，他们的做法大略如下：
    作业组的规模
    作业组是在生产队领导下组织劳动力、直接从事生产活动的最基本的单位。因此，规模不宜太大或过小。他们在讨论中认为：如果太大了，劳力很多，指挥不灵活，排工不方便，也很难和食堂、托儿所结合起来；反之，如果太小，人马不齐，搭不起一套搞生产的班子，对生产也不利。怎样才算恰当呢？大瑶公社根据便于对社员直接进行排工、指挥灵活的原则，和各个生产队的实际情况，一般一个作业组由十六户、二十五个劳动力组成。居住比较集中的地方，由二十户或二十多户、三十五个劳动力或四十个劳动力组成一个作业组。少数居住分散的地方，则由十来户或六、七户，十六、七个劳动力或十二、三个劳动力组成一个作业组。这样划分以后的好处是：第一、便于生产队的领导。一般一个生产队下面划分为五个到七个作业组，指挥方便灵活。第二、作业组经常指挥二、三十个劳动力，搭成一套整齐的生产班子，指挥如意，调度灵活，也能详细地了解社员的劳动技能和劳动态度，便于排工。第三、范围不大，便于把托儿所、食堂和作业组结合在一起，使生产和生活更好地结合起来。
    划分作业组以后，紧接着各生产队又把作业组的土地、耕牛、大农具和劳力基本上固定下来，以便于作业组安排生产。生产队有权调动作业组的劳动力，作业组也必须服从统一调动；但是，除了进行基本建设、抗御严重的自然灾害，以及为了抢季节必须突击完成某些全队规模的生产任务以外，不随便调动。把耕牛、大农具、土地固定下来，长期交给一定的作业组使用，不但有利于生产，还有利于加强作业组的生产责任和财务管理。
  生产和生活相结合
    作业组是生产组织，托儿所（幼儿园）是生活福利组织，食堂既是生活组织又是发展生猪、家禽的重要基地。大瑶公社以作业组为主，实行了作业组、食堂、托儿所（幼儿园）三结合，一般一个作业组在一个食堂吃饭，少数居住比较分散的作业组，也有一个食堂设两个灶，分两处吃饭的；一般一个作业组设一个托儿所（幼儿园）。这样，可以把生产和生活统一领导起来，使生产和生活互相配合、互相协调，有利于生产，也便于搞好生活。以作业组为单位办托儿所（幼儿园）也便于照顾孩子。这样一来，作业组就不仅成了最直接从事生产的基本战斗单位，而且成为管理生活和管理食堂经营的养猪、鸡、鸭等副业生产的基层单位。为了适应这一情况，公社普遍加强了对作业组的领导，选择成分好、工作积极、在群众中有威信、并且富有生产经验和管理水平的人担任作业组长，还选择了一个生活经验丰富，又善于勤俭过日子的人担任副组长，专管集体生活和食堂的猪、鸡生产。公社还派了四百多个生产队、大队和公社的干部兼任作业组长。
      加强责任制
    加强作业组的责任制，是领导作业组、充分发挥作业组的积极性的一个最重要、最基本的问题。为此，他们在经营管理上，采取了一系列的措施：
    第一、生产队对作业组实行“四定”（有的叫“四包”）“一奖”制。“四定”：一是定产量。按照大队包给生产队的各项作物产量，由生产队分别包到各作业组。二是定工分。根据大队包给生产队的工分和各作业组承担的任务，把工分一次包到作业组。至于以后组与组互相支援时，调入组应从本组包工中付给调出劳力的组的工分。三是定成本。四是定质量。关于奖励问题，一般规定：生产队从生产大队得到的超产奖励中，抽出50％—60％奖给超产的作业组。如果生产队没有从大队得到超产奖励，对于超产的作业组仍要实行奖励，其奖金来源可以从两方面解决：一是从大队发给的工资中抽出2％到3％；二是再从大队计划以外的收入中抽出一部分，对作业组进行奖励。作业组得奖以后，要从奖励中抽出一部分奖给优秀社员；作业组即使没有受奖，对于优秀社员也要进行奖励，其奖金来源，可从作业组经营的大队和生产队计划以外的收入中抽。对作业组实行“四定”“一奖”是生产队向大队承包任务以后，由生产队负责具体“四定”到作业组，而不是大队直接包到作业组。实行“四定”“一奖”以后，生产队还必须对作业组逐段安排工作，布置任务。实行“四定”“一奖”的好处是：一、进一步加强作业组的责任心；二、使作业组克服依赖思想，在使用资金方面认真负责，精打细算；三、进一步发挥社员的积极性，便于组与组之间热热闹闹开展竞赛。
    第二、实行计划“五到田”。作业组接受生产队分配的任务之后，为了保证计划在每块土地上落脚生根，他们将种植作物、产量、肥料、技术措施、工分都定到每块田。在实行“五定到田”当中，产量有两个指标：一个是计划指标，这是经过最大的努力可能达到的指标；另一个是包产指标，这个指标经过努力就可以超过。
    第三、田间管理责任到人。确定有一定管理能力的人，分片包干，一年到底，负责一片田的管理。管理人的责任是“三防”（防盗窃、防牲畜、防自然灾害）、“三保”（保措施、保季节、保质量）。这样，人人有责任，事事有人管，互相检查监督，便能保证农活质量，保证计划的实现。管理人员主要负责检查、监督、报告情况，要对农活质量负一定的责任，有些小事还要亲自动手去做。对于管理人员适当给以报酬，并且视其工作好坏进行奖罚。
  作业组的劳动管理
    合理安排劳动力，是完成生产计划的重要保证。各作业组安排劳动力的办法，根据各种农活的性质，大体上有三种：一是有连续性、技术性较大又不误季节的工作，如养猪、养牛、看水、种菜、田间管理、食堂作饭、带小孩等工作，实行长年包工包到人的办法。二是季节包工，三是短期临时排工。这主要是季节性较强的如插秧、收割等等工作。
    作业组按照定额评工记分，贯彻执行按劳分配的原则。
    作业组的经营范围
    作业组最主要最基本的任务，是保证完成生产队交给的生产任务。除此之外，作业组还经营着如下几项生产：第一、食堂养猪。食堂养猪是当前这个公社发展生猪生产的一个主要环节，同时，食堂养猪也列入了生产队的计划，但生产队根据公社和大队的计划，对作业组实行了“四定”“一奖”。“四定”是：定全年生猪计划、派购任务，按全年生产计划定劳力、定饲料地和定饲料。奖励就是按派购指标实行超产提成奖励。作业组完成派购任务以后的出栏猪，实行比例分成，一小部分归生产队或大队（主要归生产队），大部分归作业组。作业组所得生猪可以卖给国家，也可以自食。第二、除大队、公社办的鸡鸭饲养场以外，生产队向作业组提出发展家禽的指标，其收入除少量的上交给生产队外，基本上归作业组。第三、很难列入公社、生产队计划的零星土地、零星副业，由生产队交给作业组充分利用起来，其收入基本上归作业组所有，只交少量的给生产队。
