    Unite and Advance
    ——May Day in Cuba
        Kong Mai, Bing An

    On the morning of May 1st, a sea of one million people in Havana, with flags and slogans undulating, surged towards the Plaza de la Ciudadanía (Citizen's Square). This was a day for the Cuban people to determine to support, defend, and advance the Cuban revolution. This was a day of great unity for Cuban workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    At ten o'clock in the morning, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Raúl Castro, arrived at Rancho Boyeros Avenue. He and his comrades-in-arms and trade union leaders walked hand in hand at the front of the parade. Closely following were dozens of young women holding a huge Cuban flag. Countless white cloth banners were inscribed with slogans: "Support the Revolutionary Government!" "Long Live Great Unity!" "Organize the Militia, Defend the Revolution!"

    The newly formed militia, armed with rifles, and a series of unarmed revolutionary soldiers walked in the front. Among the militia were tobacco workers, sugarcane farmers, nurses, university students, and cooks. Their eyes were shining, their steps were neat. Workers, peasants, and soldiers walked shoulder to shoulder, which was a first in Cuba and a first in Latin America.

    The Revolutionary Armed Forces marched heroically and vigorously past the reviewing stand. People noticed that most of their weapons were American-supplied weapons seized from the dictator Batista. Now, the weapons that slaughtered the people had become weapons against imperialism and for defending the interests of the people. Among the troops receiving the review were the rebel army and female guerrillas who fought arduously in the Sierra Maestra mountains. 70% of them were farmers. There were also naval and paratrooper recruits who had enlisted for just over a month. As tanks rumbled through the Plaza de la Ciudadanía, jet planes quickly swept low over the crowd, soaring into the sky. People were amazed and cheered by the rapid growth of this revolutionary army. The Revolutionary Police Force was warmly welcomed. A tractor donated by them led the way. The slogan on the tractor read: "Support Land Reform!" The Revolutionary Police also performed stunts to capture counter-revolutionary elements in front of the reviewing stand.

    After the military parade, a huge float drove past. On the float, a sugarcane farmer was harvesting sugarcane, a worker was working with an awl, and a soldier held a rifle tightly, his alert gaze fixed on the front. A long white banner on the float was inscribed in red letters: "The Rebel Army is vigilant against the enemy, building the motherland, and educating the people."

    The masses' parade began to pass the reviewing stand. Workers, peasants, students, freelancers, white people, black people walked shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand. Daughters supported their elderly fathers, young mothers held their infants, black people beat long, cylindrical skin drums. They had various political ideologies: participants in the "26th of July Movement", communists, revolutionary leaders, and nuns wearing white hats. Together they carried a banner that read "Unite to Defend the Revolution" and marched forward.

    As the workers' contingent passed by, a group of automobile workers turned their banner demanding a 20% wage increase towards the reviewing stand, asking the broadcaster on the stand to loudly announce their demand over the loudspeaker. The loudspeaker immediately broadcast their demand. The workers immediately applauded with satisfaction. Workers in the commercial sector marched forward with a large banner that read "Develop Economic and Trade Relations with Countries Around the World." In front of them, a female worker draped in the Cuban flag, wearing a red hat symbolizing freedom, with broken chains hanging from her arms, symbolized the liberation of Cuba. At this moment, the band played the solemn Cuban national anthem.

    Cubans marched forward holding a banner that read "Strive for the Freedom of Our Brothers in Latin American Countries!" Nicaraguans, Paraguayans, Puerto Ricans, and Spaniards shouted the slogan "Support the Cuban Revolution!" and participated in the parade together with the Cubans. The patriotic overseas Chinese in Cuba carried the five-star red flag and the Cuban flag past the reviewing stand. Their contingent won applause from the masses and the reviewing stand.

    Countless tractors and harvesters drove past the square, a gift from workers and citizens to land reform. Small teams of militiamen continued to appear in the parade. Their slogan "Resolutely Eliminate Counter-Revolutionary Elements Who Sabotage the Revolution!" won bursts of applause from the people.

    The sugarcane workers' contingent marched past. They wore wide-brimmed straw hats and held long sugarcane harvesting knives in their hands. The wide-brimmed straw hat and sugarcane harvesting knife were symbols of the 1895 War of Independence.

    During the parade, trade union representatives from various Latin American countries took to the podium one after another, calling on the people of Latin American countries to support the Cuban revolution and oppose foreign interference. Venezuelan trade union representative Ojoda said that foreign monopoly capital, like a great shark, was plundering Venezuela's oil and Cuba's sugar. The Venezuelan people and the Cuban people have the same destiny. The Venezuelan people and the Cuban people will fight together for a common cause.

    In the parade, a huge float driven by dockworkers illustrated the reason for U.S. imperialism's rage. On the float was a huge, ferocious octopus, sucking the blood of a Cuban working person, who was confidently cutting off the blood vessels wrapped around him. The float read: Forty-five years of economic bondage can no longer be tolerated.

    Men, women, old and young took to the streets as early as six o'clock in the morning. Tens of thousands of people traveled from more than a hundred li (Chinese miles) away in Matanzas Province and Pinar del Río Province to participate in the parade. Despite the scorching sun and sea breeze, they waited to listen to the speech of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Raúl Castro. The parade had already been going on for fourteen hours. At this time, Raúl Castro walked to the microphone amidst the cheers and applause of the crowd. He said that the Cuban people learned from the seven years of painful experience under dictatorial rule the harm of division and the value of unity. Today, the Cuban people regard unity as a necessary condition for their survival. He loudly asked the crowd in the square: "When the skies of our motherland are once again overcast, when our revolution is once again facing a strong enemy, do you want to be divided or united?" The crowd excitedly raised their arms and shouted: Unity, unity, unity!

    Today, in every street in Santa Clara, in every village in Oriente Province, in every sugarcane field in Camagüey Province, the same cry is echoing: Unity, unity, unity! Unity is the cry of the entire Cuban people today. This cry also resounds throughout the Caribbean.

    团结前进
    ——“五一”节在古巴
        孔迈  炳庵
    五月一日清晨，哈瓦那一个百万人组成的人海，起伏着旗帜和标语的波涛，涌向公民广场。这是一个古巴人民决心支持、保卫和推进古巴革命的日子。这是一个古巴工人、农民、士兵大团结的日子。
    早晨十点，武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗来到兰却大街。他和他的战友和工会领导人手挽着手，走在游行队伍的最前面。紧跟着的几十位女青年，手里拿着巨幅古巴国旗。无数幅白布做成的标语，上面写着：“支持革命政府！”“大团结万岁！”“组织民兵，保卫革命！”
    新组成的民兵荷枪和一连徒手的革命军走在前面。民兵中有烟草工人、蔗田农民、女护士、大学生和厨师。他们目光闪闪，步伐整齐。工人、农民和士兵肩并肩走在一起，这在古巴是第一次，在拉丁美洲也是第一次。
    革命武装部队雄赳赳、气昂昂走过检阅台。人们注意到他们的武器大多是从独裁者巴蒂斯塔手里缴来的由美国供给的武器。现在，屠杀人民的武器成了反对帝国主义和保卫人民利益的武器了。接受检阅的队伍中有艰苦战斗在马埃斯特腊山区的起义军和女游击队员。他们中70％是农民。队伍里还有新入伍一个多月的海军和降落伞部队。当坦克隆隆地驶过公民广场时，喷气式飞机快速地低掠过人群，直冲云霄。人们都为这支革命军队这样快地成长感到惊奇和欢欣鼓舞。革命警察部队受到热烈欢迎。他们捐献的一架拖拉机走在前面。拖拉机上的标语写着：“支持土地改革！”革命警察在检阅台前还表演了捕捉反革命分子的特技。
    列兵式后面驶过一辆巨大的彩车。车上一个蔗田农民在收割甘蔗，一个工人拿着锥子在劳动，一个士兵紧握步枪，警惕的目光注视着前方。彩车上长幅的白布上写着红字：“起义军警惕敌人，建设祖国，教育人民”。
    群众的游行队伍开始走过检阅台。工人、农民、学生、自由职业者、白人、黑人肩并肩，手挽手走在一起。女儿搀扶着年老的父亲，年青的母亲怀抱着幼儿，黑人敲击着长管形的皮鼓。他们有着各种不同的政治思想倾向：有“七月二十六日”运动的参加者，有共产党员，有革命领导派人，也有头戴白帽的女修士。他们一起扛着“团结起来保卫革命”的标语牌前进。
    工人的队伍走过时，有一群汽车工人把他们要求提高工资20％的标语牌转向检阅台，他们要求台上的广播员在扩音器里高声宣读他们的要求。扩音器立即播出了他们的要求。工人们立即满意地鼓起掌来。商业部门的工人拿着“和世界各国发展经济和贸易关系”的大幅标语前进。在他们前面，有一个女工披着古巴国旗，头戴象征自由的红色帽子，两臂挂着已经砸断了的锁链，象征着古巴的解放。这时，乐队奏起了庄严的古巴国歌。
    古巴人拿着“争取拉丁美洲各国兄弟们自由！”的标语前进。尼加拉瓜人，巴拉圭人，波多黎各人，西班牙人喊着“支持古巴革命！”的口号和古巴人一起参加了游行。古巴的爱国华侨抬着五星红旗和古巴国旗走过检阅台。他们的队伍博得了群众和检阅台上的掌声。
    无数辆拖拉机和收割机驶过广场，这是工人、市民对土地改革的献礼。游行队伍中还陆续出现一小队一小队民兵。他们的“坚决消灭破坏革命的反革命分子！”的标语博得人们阵阵的掌声。
    制糖工人的队伍走过来了。他们头戴宽边草帽，手里高举着长形的甘蔗收割刀。宽边草帽和甘蔗收割刀都是1895年独立战争的标志。
    在游行行进中，拉丁美洲各国工会代表陆续走上讲台，号召拉丁美洲各国人民支持古巴革命，反对外国干涉。委内瑞拉工会代表奥霍达说，外国垄断资本像大鲨鱼一样掠夺着委内瑞拉的石油和古巴的糖。委内瑞拉人民和古巴人民有着同样的命运。委内瑞拉人民和古巴人民将一起为共同的目的进行斗争。
    游行队伍里，码头工人驾驶的一辆巨大的彩车说明美帝国主义暴跳如雷的原因。彩车上有一条巨大狰狞的章鱼，正在吸一个古巴劳动人民的血，那个古巴人正在信心百倍地斩断绕在他身上的吸血管。彩车上写着：四十五年经济束缚，再也不能忍受。
    男女老少从清早六点就走上了街道，有几万人从一百多里外的马坦萨斯省和皮纳尔省赶来参加游行。他们不顾烈日和海风，一直等待着倾听武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗的讲话。游行已经进行了十四个小时了。这时，劳尔·卡斯特罗在群众的欢呼和掌声中走向话筒。他说，古巴人民从独裁统治的七年痛苦经历中知道了分裂的危害和团结的可贵。今天，古巴人民把团结看作他们生存的必要条件。他大声向广场上的人群问道：“当我们祖国的天空又一次乌云密布，当我们的革命又一次面临强敌的时候，你们要分裂还是要团结？”群众激昂地振臂高呼：团结，团结，团结！
    今天，在圣克拉拉的每一个街头，在奥连特省的每一个村庄，在卡马圭省的每一个甘蔗园里，都在响着同一个呼声：团结，团结，团结！团结是今天整个古巴人民的呼声。这呼声也响彻加勒比海。
    1959年5月2日
