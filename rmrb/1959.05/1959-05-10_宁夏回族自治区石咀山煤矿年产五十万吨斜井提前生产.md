Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　A pair of inclined shafts at the Shizuishan Coal Mine, with an annual output of 500,000 tons of coal, officially went into production on the 7th.

　　The Shizuishan Coal Mine is one of the coal industry bases under construction in the Northwest. The inclined shafts that went into production this time are the largest modern mines in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Its entire production process, including hoisting, drainage, transportation, ventilation, and compressed air, is fully mechanized. The commissioning of these mines will play a significant role in promoting the further development of industry and agriculture in the autonomous region.

　　Construction of the No. 4 inclined shaft began in April of last year, with an original plan to complete it in a year and a half. Thanks to the unity and mutual assistance of all Hui and Han workers, who promoted the spirit of hard work and skillful work, and engaged in technical revolution, the progress of the project was greatly accelerated.

　　宁夏回族自治区石咀山煤矿年产五十万吨斜井提前生产
    据新华社讯　石咀山煤矿一对年产五十万吨煤的斜井，7日正式投入生产。
    石咀山煤矿是西北正在兴建的煤炭工业基地之一。这次投入生产的斜井，是宁夏回族自治区目前最大的现代化矿井。它的提升、排水、运输、通风、压风等整个生产过程全部是机械化。这对矿井投入生产，对于推动自治区工农业进一步发展将起很大的作用。
    四号斜井去年4月破土兴建，原计划用一年半的时间建成，由于全体回、汉族职工团结互助，发扬苦干和巧干的精神，大闹技术革命，大大了加速工程的进展。
