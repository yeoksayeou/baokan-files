The Creative Labor of Bee Farmers in Conghua
By our reporter Zheng Shiwen

Conghua in Guangdong is truly a well-deserved fruit country. Here, orchards abound, and flowers bloom in all seasons. In recent years, this fruit country has become a well-known advanced beekeeping area. Those who have visited here for beekeeping work have seen the rich wisdom of the working people here.

Building "Bee Mansions"

Coming here, people are first attracted by the snow-white houses in the depths of the orchards. These are the "mansions" built for bees during the Great Leap Forward last year. These "mansions" can regulate temperature, keeping them warm in winter and cool in summer. One can house fifty or sixty colonies of bees, and some can house more than a hundred colonies. After visiting these "mansions," people can't help but think: the bees here are living in "western-style buildings" first. Before cooperation, they lived in old-fashioned bamboo cages. After cooperation in 1956, they gradually moved into "modern housing" – movable-frame beehives. And now, they are living in warm in winter and cool in summer "mansions."

The beekeeping masters here told us that bees have a natural habit: if the offspring of their colony are thriving, they will be in high spirits and actively work; conversely, they will be in low spirits, unwilling to work, and even run away collectively. The breeding of bee larvae has very strict requirements for climate. When it is hot, if the nest temperature is too high, the bee colony will be busy fetching water and fanning, protecting the larvae, directly affecting their life span and reproduction; when it is cold, if the nest temperature is insufficient, it will affect the hatching of the larvae. The wooden movable-frame beehives currently in use cannot completely solve this problem because they are easily affected by external weather. Therefore, these "bee mansions" were built.

In the torrent of the Great Leap Forward last year, with the development of beekeeping, how to solve the problem of wood needed to manufacture a large number of movable-frame beehives, and how to effectively adjust the nest temperature to adapt to the reproduction of bee colonies, these issues were lingering in the minds of every beekeeping worker. At this time, Liang Baiji, a technician in the county, thought of the living conditions of wild bees dwelling in the wild. He had seen a swarm of wild bees captured by farmers in a deep mountain cave, its strength almost ten times that of domestic bees. He thought, this may be because the cave is warm in winter and cool in summer, which is more suitable for the growth of bees. If we can also successfully raise bees in caves, wouldn't the problems of wood and nest temperature be solved in one fell swoop? The county party committee supported his suggestion and achieved good results after experiments in various places. Since then, beekeeping farms in various places have continuously developed this experience, from single-colony cave rearing to multi-colony cave rearing, and further developed into the current "bee mansions."

Exercising the Power of "Bee Kingdom" Allotment

The farmers here have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience about the life, organization and habits of bees. For a simple example, if someone who does not understand bees raises a swarm of bees, often within a few days, the bee colony will slip away completely. But the farmers here can raise a swarm of bees for several generations. The county party committee attaches great importance to the practical experience of the masses, constantly organizing them to exchange and summarize, and learn new technical knowledge. With practical experience plus book knowledge, hundreds of farmer beekeepers in the county have now become excellent beekeeping masters. They skillfully manipulate the power of bee "kingdom" swarming, can artificially breed new "queens" (queen bees), and can master complex technologies such as managing the movement of queen bees and combining colonies for honey collection. There is also a natural habit in the bee world that is like dividing territory and enfeoffing vassals. Whenever a bee colony develops to a certain number, usually after male bees appear in the colony, the worker bees begin to prepare for separation. This natural swarming often causes the loss of bee colonies. After the beekeepers here mastered the swarming technology, they no longer let the bees swarm on their own. When swarming is needed, they carry out artificial swarming through artificial queen breeding, so they can plan to develop bee colonies and increase the honey production of bee colonies.

Finding New Feed

The biggest enemy of bees is the dangerous weather. In continuous rainy days, bee colonies cannot go out to collect nectar, which will affect their life and reproduction. Therefore, solving the feed problem for bees has become a major event in management work. The efforts and achievements of the beekeeping masters here in this regard have been praised by everyone who has visited. It may be hard to believe that bees actually like to drink milk tea and eat fish. But the practical experience here proves that bees not only like to eat these two things, but also are special feeds for accelerating bee colony breeding. Wang Zao, a beekeeper, discovered in years of observation that bees were sucking in cups that had contained milk tea and were reluctant to leave. Wang Lieming, another beekeeper, also found that bees were very happy to eat the remaining fish juice in the vegetable dishes. They repeatedly observed and studied carefully, and finally used milk tea mixed with sugar and fried fish juice for experiments respectively. The results showed that after the bee colonies consumed these feeds, the milk was rich, the reproduction was fast, and it was a good feed for restoring the laying of queen bees during the summering period.

The beekeepers here have also restored the reputation of native bees. In the past, many people believed that the honey collecting ability of native bees was not as good as that of Italian bees, and gave it the label of "inferior breed." But most of the bees raised here are native bees, and after innovating management technology, the honey collecting ability is not inferior to that of Italian bees. This spring, the 5,400 colonies of native bees in Jiangpu Commune produced an average of more than 35 catties of honey per colony. The 20 colonies of native bees in Jinlian team of this commune also created a record of producing an average of 72 catties of honey per colony.

    从化养蜂匠师的创造性劳动
    本报记者　郑世文
    广东从化确是一个名不虚传的水果之乡。这里，遍地林果，四时皆花。近年来，这个水果之乡，更成了一个远近扬名的养蜂先进地区。到这里参观过的养蜂工作的人，都看到这里的劳动人民丰富的智慧。
    建造“蜜蜂大厦”
    来到这里，人们首先会被果林深处，一所所粉刷得雪白的房子所吸引。这就是在去年的大跃进中为蜜蜂所建造的“大厦”。这些“大厦”能调节气温，冬暖夏凉，一所能住上五、六十群蜂，有的能住到百群以上。参观了这些“大厦”，人们不禁这样想：这里的蜜蜂倒是先住起“洋楼”来了。合作化前，它们住的还是旧式的竹笼子，1956年合作化后，它们才逐步移居到“现代化住宅”活框蜂箱里来。而现在，它们已经住上冬暖夏凉的“大厦”了。
    这里的养蜂匠师告诉我们，蜜蜂有这样一种本能的习性，如果它本群的后代繁殖昌盛，它们就情绪高涨，积极出勤；反之，它们就会情绪低落，不愿出勤，甚至集体逃跑。而蜜蜂幼虫的繁殖，对气候的要求是非常严格的。天热时，如果巢温过高，蜂群就要忙于挑水、扇风，保护幼虫，直接影响它们的寿命和繁殖；天冷时，巢温不足，又会影响幼虫的孵化。现在使用的木制活框蜂箱，由于易受外界天气影响，不能完善地解决这个问题。因此才有这种“蜜蜂大厦”的修造。
    在去年大跃进的洪流下，随着养蜂事业的发展，如何解决大量制造活框蜂箱所需的木材，如何有效地调整巢温，适应蜂群的繁殖，这些问题，都在每个养蜂工作者的脑海里盘旋。这时，县里的技术员梁百辑就想起了野蜂穴居野处时的生活状况。他曾见过农民在深山岩洞中捕获的一群野蜂，群势强大几乎等于家蜂的十倍。他就想，这可能是因为地穴里冬暖夏凉，更适宜蜜蜂的生长。如果我们也能在地穴里养蜂成功，木材问题，巢温问题，不就是一举都解决了吗？县委支持了他的这个建议，并经过各地试验取得良好效果。从此，各地养蜂场就不断发展这个经验，从单群地穴饲养，到多群地穴饲养，进一步又发展成为现在的“蜜蜂大厦”。
    操“蜂国”分封大权
    这里的农民对蜜蜂的生活、组织和习性，积累了不少的知识和经验。举个简单例子，如果让一个不懂蜂性的人饲养一群蜂，往往不上几天，蜂群便溜个精光。但这里的农民饲养一群蜂，可以流传几代。县委很重视群众的实践经验，不断组织他们交流总结，并学习新的技术知识。实践经验加上书本知识，现在全县已有几百名农民养蜂员成为出色的养蜂匠师。他们熟练地操纵了“蜂国”分蜂的大权，能人工培育新的“女王”（蜂王），能掌握调动蜂王、并群采蜜等复杂的技术。蜜蜂世界里还有一种活像列土封疆的本能习性。每当蜂群发展到一定的数量，通常是蜂群里出现了雄蜂以后，工蜂就着手准备分家的事宜。这种天然分群，常常造成蜂群的损失。这里的养蜂员掌握了分蜂的技术以后，就再不让蜜蜂自己分群了。当需要分群的时候，就通过人工育王，进行人工分蜂，因而能够有计划地发展蜂群和提高蜂群的产蜜量。
    找到新的饲料
    蜜蜂最大的敌害，就是险恶的天气。在连绵不断的雨天，蜂群不能出门采花蜜，就会影响它的生活和繁育。因此，替蜜蜂解决饲料，就成为管养工作中的一件大事。这里的养蜂匠师们在这方面所花的心思和获得的成就，使参观过的人都称赞不已。蜜蜂竟喜欢喝奶茶和吃鱼，说出来也许难以使人置信。但这里的实践经验却证明，蜜蜂不仅喜欢吃这两样东西，而且还是加速蜂群繁育的特效饲料。养蜂员王灶在积年累月的观察中发现，蜜蜂在盛过牛奶茶的杯中吸吮着不愿走。养蜂员王烈明还发现，蜜蜂很高兴吃菜碟中剩下的鱼汁。他们一次又一次的细致观察和研究，最后用牛奶茶拌糖和煎鱼汁分别进行试验，结果发现，蜂群食用这些饲料后，乳汁丰富，繁殖快，而且是越夏期恢复母蜂产卵的好饲料。
    这里的养蜂员还替本国蜂恢复了名誉。过去不少人认为本国蜂采蜜能力比不上意大利蜂，给它带上了“劣种”的帽子。但这里饲养的绝大部分是本国蜂，经过革新管养技术以后，采蜜能力并不亚于意大利蜂。江浦公社五千四百群本国蜂今年春季平均每群产蜜三十五斤多。这个公社锦联队的二十群本国蜂，还创造了平均每群产蜜七十二斤的纪录。
