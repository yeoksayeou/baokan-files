　　I.
　　The characteristics of the Western European situation in recent times have mainly manifested in the weakening of the United States' control over Western Europe and the sharpening of contradictions between Britain and France, and between Britain and West Germany. The formation of the Paris-Bonn axis between France and West Germany is a sign of the intensification of imperialist contradictions.
　　In the past eighty years, France has been subjected to three armed aggressions by Germany. To the French people, German militarism is an irreconcilable foe. However, the French ruling class's policy toward Germany has never been to prevent the revival of German militarism, but rather to use German militarism to serve its own purposes, primarily to use it as a shock force to attack the Soviet Union. After World War II, France's power was greatly weakened. In order to recover its strength and deal with the domestic progressive forces, especially the powerful French Communist Party, the French big bourgeoisie more openly adopted a policy of dependence on the United States. French monopoly capital did indeed benefit from a series of measures, such as accepting "Marshall Plan" "aid," participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and implementing an arms expansion and war preparation policy. For example, from 1947 to 1954, the actual profits of six hundred large companies increased by 2.77 times. At the same time, however, the United States also took advantage of France's difficult situation and its dependence on it to intensify its control over French monopoly capital and increasingly squeeze out France's influence overseas, especially in the colonies.
　　Britain was once an ally of France. From 1905 until the outbreak of World War II, France's foreign policy was based on the Anglo-French alliance. During World War II, the British ruling class supported Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the French government in exile in Britain, in an attempt to establish a French government under British influence after the war. However, Britain's own strength was also greatly weakened after the war, and it had to rely on the United States. Therefore, any attempt by Britain toward France could only be carried out with the help of the United States. This undermined the historical foundation of the Anglo-French alliance. However, in order to obtain mutual support in dealing with the United States, and to jointly deal with West German militarist forces, Britain and France maintained a certain alliance relationship in the early post-war period.
　　However, since the end of the war, the United States' policy in Europe has mainly been to support the forces of West German militarism, making it the main pillar for launching a new war. Therefore, for a long time, the United States has been trying to restore the strength of German militarism and wanted its Western European allies, especially France, to form an aggressive bloc together with West German militarism. Britain also attempted to have France and West Germany allied to check each other, so that Britain could occupy a favorable position on the European continent. It was for this reason that, despite the fierce opposition from the broad masses of the French people and a section of the bourgeoisie, which even thwarted the "European Defence Community" plan, the French government, due to the interests of its own class and under the pressure of the United States and Britain, signed the London and Paris Agreements aimed at rearming West Germany. This agreement actually put France in the face of the threat of dependence on West German militarism.
　　While the United States was supporting West Germany in Europe, it was also squeezing out French influence in France's overseas territories. The United States took advantage of France's predicament in the colonial war in Indochina to infiltrate South Vietnam, replacing France's position. After the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the United States colluded with West Germany to try to fill the vacuum left by the expulsion of Britain and France from the Middle East. Although Britain joined France in invading Egypt at this time, after its invasion failed, in order to make up for its losses in the Middle East, it joined the United States in undermining France's position in North Africa. The unauthorized shipment of arms to Tunisia by the United States and Britain in 1957, despite French opposition, is one example. On the Algerian colonial war, the United States and Britain also played a double game, on the one hand helping and supporting the French army in suppressing the Algerian national liberation movement, and on the other hand trying to intervene when France was weakened in this war. France is trying to resist the infiltration of the United States and Britain.
　　In the second half of 1957, the successful launch of Soviet artificial satellites shook the "leadership position" of the United States in the Western world. The United States had to rely on Britain's strength to stabilize its increasingly alienated "allies." At the same time, Britain also took advantage of the United States' weakness at the time to take a share of the remnants of the United States' leadership, posing as the second ally. Therefore, one of the main roles of the US-British alliance at that time was to suppress France and other Western European "allies" in order to consolidate the leadership of the US and Britain in the imperialist camp.
　　II.
　　From the above developments, the French bourgeoisie saw that since the pro-British line was not feasible and the policy of dependence on the United States was becoming increasingly unsustainable, the pro-West German forces gradually gained ground. First of all, the French coal and steel monopoly capital saw the strength of West Germany's economic power, and the "Coal and Steel Community" organized after the war gave them some benefits from cooperating with West German monopoly capital. First of all, after the abolition of tariffs, the French steel industry could obtain cheap Ruhr coal. Although French coal is not a match for West Germany, French monopoly capital believes that it can maintain its position by controlling the Saar and part of the West German coal mines. At the same time, French monopoly capital is also actively entering the Ruhr coal mines. For example, the French Wendel Group has acquired a large number of shares in the West German Flick Company. Therefore, on this basis, French monopoly capital has further demanded "cooperation" with West German monopoly capital.
　　This idea of French monopoly capital also coincides with the wishes of West German monopoly capital. After the establishment of the Bonn government in 1949, West German monopoly capital took Western Europe as its target for development. As early as 1951, West Germany's economic strength had recovered to a level slightly exceeding that of France, and its development rate was much faster than that of France. West German monopoly capital is confident in cooperating with France. In the past few years, West German monopoly capital has relied on its strong industrial base, newer equipment, low wages, and faster development in the "Coal and Steel Community" to overcome other countries and occupy a dominant position. Therefore, West German monopoly capital also sees that "cooperation" with French monopoly capital is not only beneficial but also a shortcut to seizing hegemony on the European continent.
　　From the perspective of US imperialism, the "Coal and Steel Community" is conducive to further US capital controlling Western European coal and steel enterprises, and at the same time, it can establish a military-industrial base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As for Britain, since it cannot prevent the emergence of such a super-cartel, it has to find a way to establish certain ties with this organization in order to protect its heavy industry and Commonwealth market from significant damage. However, in recent years, the balance of power in Western European countries has undergone new changes. The main change is that West Germany's economic strength has grown even more. It has not only far exceeded France, but also surpassed Britain in the steel industry and other aspects. In terms of exports, West Germany has surpassed France and is on par with Britain. The growth of West Germany's strength requires a larger scale of external expansion, especially strengthening its ambition to compete with the United States and Britain for overseas spheres of influence. At the same time, West German monopoly capital is trying to enter France's sphere of influence in Africa through "cooperation" with French monopoly groups. In order to resist the infiltration of US and British forces into its colonies, French monopoly capital urgently needs to strengthen the development of its colonies. However, it lacks funds, so the French and German monopoly capital, which already had a basis for cooperation, found a basis for further "cooperation." In the spring of 1957, in order to promote the "cooperation" of capital between the two countries in Africa, a "French-German Economic Committee" was established in Paris. In the banking sector, the banking capital of the two countries successively formed the "West German-French Industrial Investment and Investment Company" and the "West German-French Banking Committee." Deutsche Bank and the French "Banque de l'Indochine" are also the main shareholders of the Western European "Development of African Natural Resources Company." At the same time, the industrial monopoly capital of France and West Germany is also becoming increasingly closely linked. French monopoly capital controls 12% and 14% of West German coal and coke production respectively. The West German Flick monopoly group also controls a smelting and heavy machinery manufacturing enterprise in Lorraine, France. In addition, it is worth noting that West Germany became France's most important seller and buyer in foreign trade in 1958. It is precisely because of the increasingly close economic ties between the two countries that the proposal to form a "common market" put forward by the six Western European countries in 1955 was formally organized.
　　Politically, the US and British "mutual dependence" policy attempted to create a situation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that was dominated by them. They tried to monopolize the right to manufacture nuclear weapons. This situation was not only opposed by France, but also made West Germany, which claimed to be the leader of Western Europe, extremely dissatisfied. Therefore, France joined forces with West Germany and Italy to form a "three-nation arms alliance" to prepare for manufacturing atomic weapons themselves. From West Germany's point of view, cooperation with France in manufacturing atomic weapons could bypass the restrictions and prohibitions imposed by the Paris Agreement in this regard. France, on the other hand, could use West Germany's financial resources and technology to accelerate the manufacture of its own atomic weapons. The close relationship between France and West Germany entered a new stage when De Gaulle came to power.
　　De Gaulle's rise to power was actually a hope for French monopoly capital to revive its position abroad. Therefore, after De Gaulle gained power, he tried his best to restore "France's greatness" and "strive for great power status" with the United States and Britain. But France's capital was not enough to do this. So he wanted to rely on West Germany's support to achieve his goal. Therefore, De Gaulle reversed the past tone, expressing that he would be loyal to the "small Europe" policy, and intensified cooperation with West Germany within the scope of the "common market" and "atomic energy community." After three meetings between De Gaulle and Adenauer, the so-called Paris-Bonn axis was formed. This axis has already played a role in the struggle against Britain's "free trade zone" plan. This is particularly evident in the struggle over the UK's "free trade zone" issue.
　　Since the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the demilitarization of West Berlin, Macmillan took advantage of the situation favorable to Britain and resolutely visited Moscow, and expressed his willingness to hold a summit conference of great powers to ease the tense situation in Europe. Macmillan's expression was welcomed by the British people and the people of Western European countries (including the West German people), but it caused great anxiety among the Bonn ruling class. In this way, the contradictions between Britain and West Germany were completely surfaced. In order to deal with this pressure from Britain, West Germany urgently needed De Gaulle's support. When Macmillan visited the Soviet Union, Adenauer tried his best to collude with De Gaulle. At present, France also needs West Germany's support. Therefore, on the German issue, West Germany and France have been colluding together recently to create an atmosphere unfavorable to the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
　　III.
　　However, this axis, which is based on the mutual exploitation of the monopoly capital of the two countries, cannot solve or alleviate the contradictions between the monopoly capital of the two countries.
　　For example, on the Saar issue, the two countries have had long-standing disputes, and this contradiction has not been well resolved at present. In the "Coal and Steel Community," France is also increasingly at a disadvantage. When the community was established in 1952, the steel production under French control was about 16 million tons (10.6 million tons in France, 2.8 million tons in the Saar, plus a portion of Luxembourg's production controlled by French capital); West Germany was about 15 million tons. In terms of coal production, West Germany has an overwhelming advantage. By 1958, West Germany's steel production had reached more than 22 million tons, while the amount controlled by France was not much more than in 1952. France's predicament in coal has not improved either. According to the agreement,
  France can obtain 90 million tons of coal from the Saar and West Germany in the 25 years starting from 1956, and it can also purchase about 17 million tons from the Saar every year. For France, this is far from meeting its needs. However, West German monopoly capital believes that this is a very unreasonable arrangement. At the same time, in order to strengthen the competitive power of its commodities, French monopoly capital also implemented another devaluation of the franc through the De Gaulle government at the end of last year. This made the prices of some products lower than those of West Germany, especially steel products, which were 8% lower than those of West Germany. Therefore, it was strongly protested by the Ruhr Konzern. They asked the French government to impose a 4% export tax or raise export prices through the "High Authority" of the "Coal and Steel Community", but French monopoly capital resolutely refused. This issue has not yet been resolved.
　　Although French monopoly capital allowed West Germany to develop French Africa through the "common market," this is undoubtedly "bringing a wolf into the house." West Germany's influence is increasingly expanding in French Africa, which cannot but make France extremely afraid. Therefore, before the implementation of the "common market," French monopoly capital vigorously increased investment and concentrated capital to enhance its position. At the same time, various restrictions and controls were placed on the infiltration of West German capital. This, of course, caused dissatisfaction among West German monopoly capital.
　　The economic contradictions between France and West Germany are manifested politically as a struggle between the two countries for the leadership of Western Europe.
　　The ruling groups of France and West Germany both advocate "European unification" and strengthening the "unity" of "small Europe," but they both want to be the leader of Western Europe. De Gaulle's struggle with the United States and Britain for the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has aroused Bonn's dissatisfaction and jealousy. On the West Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue, although Paris and Bonn have consistently resisted Macmillan's proposals, France is not wholeheartedly on their side. De Gaulle's recent expression of recognition of the current Oder-Neisse boundary is obviously because France cannot but realize that any attempt to change the status quo will lead to war. The painful lessons of history have shown how dangerous it is for France to form an alliance with West German militarism. In short, the relationship between Paris and Bonn is one of mutual exploitation and mutual exclusion, and there is a fatal threat to France, which sows the seeds of discord in the Franco-German axis.

    巴黎—波恩轴心的幕后
    钱能欣
    一
    最近一个时期来，西欧局势的特点主要表现在美国对西欧控制的削弱，英国和法国之间、英国和西德之间的矛盾的尖锐化。而法国和西德结成巴黎—波恩轴心，则是帝国主义矛盾尖锐化的一个标志。
    在过去的八十多年中，法国受到德国三次武装侵略，德国军国主义对法国人民来说是不共戴天的世仇。但是法国统治阶级的对德政策，一直不是在于防止德国军国主义的复活，而是如何利用德国军国主义来为自己服务，首先是利用它来充当进攻苏联的突击队。第二次大战后法国的力量大大地被削弱了。为了恢复元气和对付国内进步力量，特别是法国共产党的强大力量，法国大资产阶级更公开地采取依附美国的政策。法国垄断资本从接受“马歇尔计划”的“援助”、参加北大西洋集团、执行扩军备战政策等一系列措施中果然得到了好处，例如，从1947年到1954年，六百家大公司的实际利润就增加了二点七七倍。但同时，美国也利用了法国的困难处境和对它的依赖，加紧把法国垄断资本置于自己的控制之下，并且日益排挤法国在海外，特别是在殖民地的势力。
    英国曾是法国的盟国，从1905年起到第二次世界大战发生，法国的对外政策一直是以英法联盟为基础的。在第二次世界大战期间，英国统治阶级曾经支持流亡在英国的法国政府首领戴高乐，想在战后建立一个受英国影响的法国政府。但是，战后英国本身的力量也大大受到削弱，也不得不依靠美国，因此，它对法国的任何企图，实际上也只能依靠美国来实行。这就使得历史上英法联盟的基础濒于瓦解。但是为了在和美国打交道时取得相互支持，为了联合对付西德军国主义势力，英法两国在战后初期还维持一定的联盟关系。
    但是，战后以来，美国在欧洲的政策主要是扶植西德军国主义的力量，使它作为发动新战争的主要支柱。因此，长期以来美国就竭力恢复德国军国主义的势力，并且要它的西欧盟国，特别是法国，也和西德军国主义一起组成一个侵略集团。英国也企图让法国和西德结盟后互相牵制，从而使英国在西欧大陆上居于有利的地位。正是由于这种原因，尽管法国国内广大人民和一部分资产阶级激烈反对，这种反对的力量甚至曾经挫败了“欧洲防务集团”计划，但是法国政府由于自身阶级的利益，并且在美英的压力下，签订了旨在重新武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定。这个协定实际上是使法国面临依附于西德军国主义的威胁。
    美国在欧洲扶植西德的同时，又在法国海外领地上节节排挤法国的势力。美国利用法国在印度支那殖民战争中的困境，使自己渗入南越替代了法国的地位。英法侵埃战争失败后，美国又和西德勾结，乘着英法被逐出中东的空隙，竭力填补他们的真空。英国这时虽然跟法国合伙侵略了埃及，但是当它侵略失败之后，为了弥补它在中东的损失，又同美国一起挖法国在北非的墙角。1957年美英不顾法国的反对擅自向突尼斯运送军火，就是一例。在阿尔及利亚殖民战争上，美英也耍两面手法，一方面帮助和支持法国军队镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动，另一方面又企图当法国在这场战争中被削弱时，插手进去。法国对于美英的渗入正在竭力加以抵抗。
    1957年下半年，苏联人造卫星的发射成功，动摇了美国在西方世界中的“领导地位”，美国不得不借助英国的力量来安定它那日益离心离德的“盟国”。同时，英国也利用美国当时的弱点，分取美国领导权的残羹，俨然以二号盟主自居。因此当时美英的联盟的主要作用之一就是压制法国和其他西欧“盟国”，以便巩固美英在帝国主义阵营中的领导权。
    二
    从以上的发展中，法国资产阶级看到亲英路线既然走不通，而依附美国的政策又愈来愈维持不下去，于是亲西德的势力就渐渐抬头。首先是法国的煤钢垄断资本由于看到西德经济力量的强大，同时在战后组织起的“煤钢联营”，又使它们得到同西德垄断资本合作的某些好处。首先，取消关税后，法国的钢铁工业可以得到便宜的鲁尔煤。法国的煤虽然不是西德的对手，但是法国垄断资本相信，通过控制萨尔和一部分西德的煤矿的办法可以保持自己的地位。同时法国垄断资本还积极打入鲁尔的煤矿。例如法国温台尔集团就购得了西德弗利克公司的大量股票。因此，在此基础上，法国垄断资本也就进一步要求同西德垄断资本进行“合作”了。
    法国垄断资本的这种想法，也正合西德垄断资本的心意。1949年波恩政府成立以后，西德垄断资本就以西欧大陆为它们发展的对象。早在1951年，西德的经济实力已经恢复到稍稍超过法国的程度，而且它的发展速度比法国快得多。和法国合作，西德垄断资本是有把握的。几年来，在“煤钢联营”中西德垄断资本依靠它们雄厚的工业基础，较新的设备，低廉的工资，发展较快等优越条件，有把握地战胜其他国家而占据优势地位。因此，西德垄断资本也看到同法国垄断资本“合作”，不仅有益无损，而且是通向攫取西欧大陆霸权的捷径。
    从美帝国主义角度来看，“煤钢联营”既有利于美国资本进一步控制西欧的煤钢企业，同时又可为北大西洋集团建立军事工业基础。至于英国，既然不能阻止这样的超卡特尔的出现，它只好设法和这个机构取得一定的联系，借以保护自己的重工业和英联邦市场不受重大损害。但是，近几年来，西欧各国的力量对比又发生了新的变化。主要是西德的经济实力有了更大增长，它不但远远超过了法国，而且在钢铁工业和其他方面也超过了英国。在输出方面，西德已超过了法国，和英国处于不相上下的地位。西德实力的增长就要求更大规模地向外扩张，特别是加强了它同美英争夺海外势力范围的雄心。同时，西德垄断资本力图通过同法国垄断集团的“合作”而大举侵入法国在非洲的势力圈。而法国垄断资本为了抵抗美英势力渗入它的殖民地，也亟需加强对殖民地的开发。但是它缺乏资金，于是已经有了合作基础的法德垄断资本又找到了进一步“合作”的基础。1957年春，为了促进两国资本在非洲的“合作”，在巴黎成立了一个“法—德经济委员会”，在银行方面，两国银行资本先后合组了“西德—法国工业入股及投资公司”和“西德—法国银行委员会”。德意志银行和法国“东方汇理银行”又同是西欧“开发非洲自然资源公司”中的最主要股东。而与此同时，法国、西德的工业垄断资本也日益紧密地勾结起来。法国垄断资本分别控制了西德煤和焦炭生产的12％和14％。而西德的弗利克垄断集团也控制了法国洛林一家冶炼和重型机械制造企业。此外，值得注意的是，西德在1958年已经成为法国对外贸易中的最重要卖主和买主。正由于两国经济上越来越密切的勾结，西欧六国在1955年提出的筹组“共同市场”的建议，也就随之正式组织起来了。
    在政治上，美英的“相互依赖”政策企图在北大西洋集团中造成一种受它们支配的局面。它们竭力要垄断制造核武器的权利，这种情况不仅遭到法国反对，也特别使以西欧盟主自居的西德感到极大不满。因此当时法国就联合西德和意大利组成“三国军火同盟”准备自己制造原子武器。从西德来说，和法国合作制造原子武器就可以绕过巴黎协定对西德这方面的限制和禁止。而法国则借助西德的财力和技术来加速制造自己的原子武器。法国和西德的这种密切关系到戴高乐上台时更进入了一个新阶段。
    戴高乐的上台，实际上也是法国垄断资本力图在国外重振地位的一个希望。因此，当戴高乐大权在握之后，他就竭力要恢复“法国的伟大”，同美英“争取大国地位”。但是法国要这样作，他的本钱还不够。于是他就想依靠西德的支持来达到他的目的。因此，戴高乐就一反过去的基调，表示将忠于“小欧洲”政策，并在“共同市场”和“原子能联营”范围内加紧和西德的合作。经过戴高乐和阿登纳三次会谈，所谓巴黎—波恩轴心就形成了。这个轴心在对付英国的“自由贸易区”计划的斗争中已经发生作用。这特别表现在和英国的“自由贸易区”问题的斗争上。
    自从苏联提出缔结对德和约和西柏林非军事化的建议后，麦克米伦利用了有利于英国的形势毅然访问了莫斯科，并且表示愿意举行大国首脑会议，缓和欧洲紧张局势。麦克米伦这种表示得到了英国人民和西欧各国人民（包括西德人民）的欢迎，但却引起了波恩统治阶级的极大不安。这样，英国和西德之间的矛盾就完全表面化了。为了对付英国的这种压力，西德亟需戴高乐的支持。在麦克米伦访苏时，阿登纳就竭力和戴高乐勾结一起。目前法国也正需要西德的支持。因此，在德国问题上，最近以来，西德和法国一直勾结一起，制造不利于日内瓦外长会议的气氛。
    三
    但是，这个建立在两国垄断资本相互利用基础上的轴心，是不能解决或缓和两国垄断资本之间的矛盾的。
    例如，在萨尔问题上，两国长期来就有过争吵，而目前这个矛盾并没有很好解决。在“煤钢联营”中，法国也日益处于不利的地位。在1952年联营成立时，法国控制下的钢产量约有一千六百万吨（法国本国一千零六十万吨，萨尔二百八十万吨，再加上受法国资本控制的一部分卢森堡的产量）；西德约一千五百万吨，在煤产量方面，西德占绝大优势。到1958年，在钢产量方面，西德达到了二千二百多万吨。而法国所控制的却比1952年多不了多少。在煤炭方面，法国的困境也没有改善。根据协定，
  法国从1956年起的二十五年内可以从萨尔和西德获得九千万吨煤炭，并且每年还可以从萨尔购买约一千七百万吨，对法国来说这还远不能满足它的需要。可是西德垄断资本却认为这是很不合理的安排。同时法国垄断资本为了加强自己的商品的竞争力量，在去年年底还通过戴高乐政府实行了又一次的法郎贬值。这使得某些产品的价格低于西德的产品，特别是钢产品比西德低了8％，因此遭到了鲁尔康采恩的强烈抗议。它们通过“煤钢联营”的“高级机构”要法国政府征收4％的出口税，或是提高出口价格，但是法国垄断资本坚决拒绝。这问题至今还未获得解决。
    法国垄断资本虽然让西德通过“共同市场”来开发法属非洲，但这无疑是“引狼入室”，西德的势力却日益在法属非洲扩张起来，这不能不使法国极为害怕。因此，法国垄断资本在“共同市场”实施以前，就大力增加投资、集中资本以增强自己的地位。同时，对西德资本的渗入加以种种限制和控制。这当然又引起西德垄断资本的不快。
    法国和西德经济上的矛盾在政治上表现的是两国争夺西欧领导权的斗争。
    法国和西德的统治集团都主张“欧洲统一”，加强“小欧洲”的“团结”，但是它们都想当西欧大陆的盟主。戴高乐向美英争夺北大西洋集团领导权的斗争曾引起了波恩的不满和忌妒。在西柏林问题和对德和约问题上，虽然巴黎和波恩一致抵制着麦克米伦的主张，但是法国也不是全心全意的。不久前戴高乐表示承认奥德—尼斯现行疆界，就显然是因为法国不能不意识到任何改变现状的企图都将导致战争。惨痛的历史教训已经说明，同西德军国主义结成联盟对于法国是一种多么危险的赌博。总之，巴黎和波恩之间的关系是相互利用而又相互排斥，并存在着对法国的致命威胁，这就在法德的轴心中埋下了不和的种子。
