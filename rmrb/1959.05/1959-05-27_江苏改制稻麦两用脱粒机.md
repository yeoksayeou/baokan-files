Jiangsu Reforms Rice-Wheat Dual-Purpose Threshing Machine

    (Reported by this newspaper) Agricultural machinery factories in Jiangsu are converting large numbers of rice threshers into rice-wheat dual-purpose threshing machines to meet the heavy threshing tasks after the summer harvest.

    There are three types of rice-wheat dual-purpose threshing machines that Jiangsu Province has finalized for promotion: the foot-pedaled flywheel threshing machine from the Jinsha Agricultural Machinery Factory in Nantong County, the foot-pedaled reciprocating threshing machine from the Dongjiang People's Commune Agricultural Machinery Factory in Wuxi City, and the waterwheel treadle-axle threshing machine from the Jiangdu County Woodware Factory. These three types of rice-wheat dual-purpose threshing machines all have relatively high efficiency. Calculated on the basis of two people operating for ten hours a day, they can thresh 1,200 to 1,600 catties of wheat, with a threshing purity rate of over 96%. These three threshing machines also have the characteristics of being easy to use, simple in structure, and convenient to obtain materials.

    Now, Jiangsu Province, based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, has decided to convert 150,000 to 200,000 of the existing 300,000 rice threshers first, to ensure the needs of summer crop threshing. The picture below shows the foot-pedaled flywheel threshing machine from the Jinsha Agricultural Machinery Factory in Nantong County. (Jiayan, Shilin)

    江苏改制稻麦两用脱粒机
    本报讯  江苏各地农具厂正在把大批打稻机改制为稻麦两用脱粒机，迎接夏收作物收割后繁重的脱粒任务。
    江苏省定型推广的稻麦两用脱粒机共有三种，即南通县金沙农具厂脚踏飞轮式脱粒机，无锡市东降人民公社农具厂脚踏往复式脱粒机，及江都县木器厂水车踏轴式脱粒机。这三种稻麦二用脱粒机工效都比较高，每天以二人操作十小时计算，可脱麦粒一千二百斤至一千六百斤，脱粒净度都在96％以上。这三种脱粒机还具备使用轻便、构造简单、取材方便等特点。
    现在江苏省各地本着因地制宜的原则，决定把三十万部打稻机先改制十五至二十万部，以保证夏收作物脱粒的需要。下图是南通县金沙农具厂脚踏飞轮式脱粒机。          （加言、士林）
