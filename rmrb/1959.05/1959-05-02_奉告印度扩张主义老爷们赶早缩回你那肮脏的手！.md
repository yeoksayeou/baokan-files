In Representative Rong Yiren's speech, he also said that facts prove that believing in the Party is always right, and doubting the Party is always wrong. Therefore, honestly following the Party is never wrong. Chairman, fellow representatives:
	I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's reports, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report to the CPPCC.
	Time flies like an arrow, and almost ten years have passed quickly since the liberation of Shanghai. At this time ten years ago, the People's Liberation Army was marching south with a million soldiers, sweeping through everything in its path, and approaching Shanghai. At that time, the officials of the Kuomintang reactionaries asked our factory for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and flour every day, preparing to earn capital to escape; the reactionary army set up machine guns at my door, extorting and extorting. My elderly father lived in Wuxi, and news was blocked, and I didn't know if he was safe. I really resented and hated the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. I also heard rumors everywhere that the Communists would share property and wives when they came, and that they would make people's wives and children scattered and their families destroyed. On the surface, I had to pretend to be calm, so as not to make some colleagues in the factory uneasy, but my heart was like "ants on a hot pot," not knowing what to do. I wanted to leave the motherland and be an overseas Chinese, but I still had a bit of ambition and was unwilling to be bullied and manipulated by foreigners in foreign countries. I still stayed in Shanghai with a hard head and tried my luck. It was not until May 25, when the People's Liberation Army entered the city, without taking a single needle or thread from the common people, and the military control committee held a forum for the industrial and commercial circles at the Bank of China on June 3, and announced the industrial and commercial policies, that my mind was settled (not completely settled). In the past ten years, the face of the motherland has undergone fundamental changes, industrial and agricultural production has increased exponentially, and large-scale basic construction has been carried out everywhere, which is a scene of prosperity. To this day, I am still elected as a representative to the Second National People's Congress, and I have also served as a member of the Third CPPCC National Committee. I am here to discuss state affairs with comrades; in Shanghai, I have also been arranged for a very good job; the family is reunited, life is stable, and sometimes three or five friends, a small talk, being in a situation of production development, national prosperity, and "we are getting better every day", recalling the kind of worried look back then, I can't help but laugh at myself.
	Of course, the prosperity and strength of our country and the happiness of our lives are not readily available. The semi-feudal and semi-colonial society has brought us endless pain and disaster. Taking the capitalist road will only make us suffer the aggression and rule of imperialism again. The reason why we have today is the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, uniting the people of all ethnic groups and strata across the country to take the socialist road. The change of social system and the victory of the socialist revolution in politics and ideology have inspired the people across the country, especially the working people, to be "spiritually invigorated, fighting spirit high, and high-spirited", and a great leap forward has emerged, making it possible to live a democratic, free, prosperous, and happy life. The reality of the past ten years has further proved that only socialism is the only correct and bright road.
	For us industrialists and businessmen, the Party has always implemented the policy of peaceful transformation based on the characteristics of the national bourgeoisie, and has adopted the policies of unity, criticism, and education to help us carry out self-education and self-transformation. It has also adopted the method of redemption for us, and made arrangements for us in work, life, and politics, so that we can work and transform with peace of mind. Such treatment is truly benevolent. Facts have proved that due to the Party's consistent implementation of this great and correct policy, the vast majority of our industrialists and businessmen have also been able to settle down and seek progress.
	However, although the Party's policies are definitely unwavering, we do have problems in the middle of accepting them. Whenever a new problem arises, there will always be doubts, worries, and unrest. I myself am like this. For example, the Five-Anti Campaign was to oppose the five poisonous behaviors and educate industrialists and businessmen to love the country and abide by the law. At that time, I thought that the Communist Party probably didn't want us anymore; after the enterprise merged, the method of fixed interest was proposed, and I thought it probably wouldn't be big, a little bit would be counted, in fact, the government announced a fixed interest of 5%, which would not change for seven years, far exceeding the general industrialists and businessmen's hope of "sitting on 3% and watching 4%" (saying that the fixed interest only needs 3%, but hoping for 4% in their hearts). When the anti-Rightist rectification movement began, it was clearly to defeat the rampant attack of the bourgeois Rightists and clarify the major issues of right and wrong on the two roads. I thought that this time some representative figures would be finished. This kind of uneasy mood is like Xiao Guiying in "Fishing and Killing Home". She clearly followed Xiao En to kill her family, but she still asked what to do with the furniture, and when the boat reached the center of the river, she asked if the killing was real or fake, and she was always reluctant to give up the old things and doubted and worried about the new things. The fact is that the Party's policy of peaceful transformation has never changed. Recently, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, in response to the ideological concerns of industrialists and businessmen after the emergence of the People's Commune, reiterated the policy of "five invariables" at the joint meeting of the Executive Committees of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce: fixed interest unchanged, high salaries unchanged, appropriate arrangements for political status unchanged, academic titles unchanged, and the policy of peaceful transformation unchanged. The reason why we are so constantly repeating is precisely a reflection of our class essence. The capitalist things that we have been accustomed to for many years cannot be abandoned all at once, and we must make long-term and continuous efforts to transform ourselves.
	However, in the education of ten years of real life, I have also come to a conclusion that because I have not been completely transformed, the capitalist ideology will continue to emerge, and I will trust the Party sometimes, doubt it sometimes, half believe it and half doubt it, and doubt it; and our Party is a Party that has been tested for a long time, leading us to take the socialist road, and has achieved unparalleled great achievements in the past ten years; facts have proved that we are always right when we believe in the Party, and we are always wrong when we doubt the Party. Therefore, honestly following the Party is never wrong. If some problems are not understood or connected, follow along first, and then gradually understand and get through them. If this is a bit superstitious, I think it is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be superstitious about the Party and the truth. This will become a driving force instead of an obstacle in our socialist road, and become a positive factor instead of a negative factor. When we have already seen last year's Great Leap Forward, and we see that an even greater leap forward will inevitably appear this year, and then we look forward to the Great Leap Forward year after year, transforming our country from a "poor and blank" face into one of the most prosperous and happy societies in the world without exploitation and oppression, everyone will be beaming with joy, everyone will live a long life, and we will all be able to contribute our own strength to such a cause. This is truly a good thing that benefits both others and ourselves, and it will be so pleasant!
	Under the education and cultivation of the Party, I have been undergoing transformation for ten years. The Party has always given me deep care, tireless education, and placed earnest expectations on me. It has made good arrangements and preferential care for me in work, life, and politics. Although I have done some work, I have also made many mistakes, and I feel very ashamed. However, "the past is gone, the future can be pursued." In the future, I will definitely actively participate in the work of socialist construction and continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation. The first thing is to actively participate in this year's national movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and learn the spirit of Xiao Guiying when she killed her family and make a big effort.
	The Party's transformation of industrialists and businessmen in the past ten years has made us more and more trust the Party and more and more close to the Party, and has made us deeply appreciate the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation. Now Tibet will also gradually carry out democratic reform and social reform. I believe that the Party will definitely implement the policy of peaceful transformation in the same way according to the specific situation in Tibet. This will definitely be welcomed and approved by the patriotic and progressive people of the upper and middle classes in Tibet like us.
	Tibet's backward serf system has made most of the Tibetan people live in a dark and sunless life. It is really too far from the development of society. If such a system continues to be preserved, it will explode like a volcano one day. However, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group dreamed of forever preserving such a backward serf system to cruelly exploit and enslave the people. They dared to collude with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to kidnap the Dalai Lama and launch an armed rebellion. This is what the people of all ethnic groups in our country, including the Tibetan people, cannot tolerate and resolutely oppose. I fully support all the measures taken by the government to quell the Tibetan rebellion and completely wipe out the rebellious bandits.
	What is infuriating is that some expansionists have also appeared in our great neighbor India, pretending to be "greatly compassionate", clamoring for "Tibetan independence", describing the rebellion as "the outpouring of Tibetan patriotic sentiments", openly opposing our country's quelling of the rebellion, shamelessly declaring that India should inherit the British imperialist's "monopoly rights" over Tibet, and attempting to intervene and "fish in troubled waters." What is even more annoying is that some government officials in India followed the rebellious elements, eagerly entertained them, and while serving by their side, they repeatedly distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement", and even condoned thugs to insult the photos of our leaders. This absurd act would not be surprising if it came from imperialists, because they were originally against us, but now it appears in India, which is friendly to us. They have forgotten that even when India was occupied by British imperialism, the imperialists were not able to separate Tibet from China; they have forgotten that China and India have had a history of harmonious coexistence for two thousand years and were the first to advocate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; they have forgotten that the vast number of peace-loving Indian people stand on the side of justice; they have forgotten that the 650 million people of China will not allow any country to interfere in their internal affairs. I advise the Indian expansionist gentlemen to quickly retract your dirty hands, the hospitable Chinese people are also skilled at catching pickpockets, Tibet is Chinese territory, and no one is allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    奉告印度扩张主义老爷们赶早缩回你那肮脏的手！
    荣毅仁代表的发言中还说，事实证明，相信党的时候总是对的，怀疑党的时候总是错的。因此老老实实地跟着党走，没有差。主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，和李维汉副主席在政协所作的报告。
    光阴如箭，日月如梭，上海解放，匆匆快要十年了。十年前的此时，正是人民解放军百万雄师下江南，势如破竹，兵临上海的时候。当时国民党反动派的官吏，天天向我们厂里要棉纱、棉布，要面粉，准备捞逃命的本钱；反动军队在我家门口架起了机关枪，敲诈勒索。我年老的父亲住在无锡，音信阻隔，不知是否安全。对国民党反动统治真是怨尽恨绝。又听得谣言四起，说什么共产党来了要共产共妻，要弄得人家妻离子散，家破人亡。我在外表上还要故作镇静，免得厂里的一些同事惶惶不安，内心却好似“热锅上的蚂蚁”，不知如何是好，想要远离祖国，做个海外寓公，总算还有点志气，不愿意到外国做白华受人欺侮、任人摆布，还是硬着头皮留在上海，碰碰运气。直到五月二十五日，解放军进城，不取老百姓一针一线，六月三日军管会在中国银行召开了工商界座谈会，宣布了工商政策，心神才为之一定（不是大定）。在这十年中间，祖国的面貌起了根本的变化，工农业生产成倍地增长，到处都展开了规模巨大的基本建设，正是一派兴旺气象。时到今日，我仍是被选为二届人大代表，还当了三届政协委员，在这里和同志们一起讨论国家大事；在上海还给我安排了很好的工作岗位；一家团聚，生活安定，有时三朋四友，小叙畅谈，处身在生产发展、国家兴旺、“我们一天天好起来”的境地，回想当年那种杞人忧天的神情，自己亦不觉为之失笑。
    当然我们国家的繁荣富强，生活的美满幸福并不是垂手可得的。半封建半殖民地的社会给我们带来了无限的痛苦和灾难，走资本主义道路只会使我们重遭帝国主义的侵略统治。我们所以有今天，是中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，团结了全国各民族、各阶层人民走社会主义道路的结果。社会制度的变革，政治上思想上社会主义革命的胜利，鼓舞了全国人民群众，特别是劳动群众“精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”，出现了大跃进的局面，才有可能过着民主、自由、繁荣、幸福的生活。十年来的现实生活更证明了只有社会主义是唯一正确的光明大道。
    对我们工商业者，党根据了民族资产阶级的特点，始终贯彻着和平改造的方针，对我们采用着团结、批评、教育的政策，帮助我们进行自我教育和自我改造。并对我们采取了赎买的办法，进行了工作上、生活上和政治上的安排，使我们能够安心工作、安心改造。这样的对待，真正是仁至义尽。事实证明，由于党的始终不渝地贯彻了这个伟大正确的方针，使我们绝大多数的工商业者也因此既能心定下来，又能求得进步。
    可是尽管党的方针政策是肯定不移的，而我们在接受中间却并不是没有问题的，每当一个新的问题发生的时候，总是会产生怀疑，顾虑、动荡不安。我自己也是如此。例如五反运动是为了反对五毒行为、教育工商业者爱国守法，我当时却认为大概是共产党不要我们了；企业合营以后，提出了定息的办法，我想大概不会大的，多少有点算了，事实上政府宣布了定息五厘，七年不变，远超过了一般工商业者
  “坐三观四”的希望（嘴里讲定息只要三厘，心里希望四厘），反右整风运动开始的时候，明明是为了打退资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，辩清两条道路的大是大非问题，我想这次大概一些代表性人物要完蛋了。这种动荡不安的心情，好似打渔杀家里的萧桂英，明明跟萧恩去杀家了，还要问家具怎么办，船到江心又要问杀人是真的还是假的，老是对旧东西恋恋不舍，对新事物怀疑顾虑。事实是党的和平改造政策是始终不变的，最近李先念副总理针对了人民公社出现后的工商业者思想顾虑，又在民建、工商联两会中执委的联席会议上重申了定息不变、高薪不变、政治地位适当安排不变、学衔不变、和平改造政策不变的“五不变”的政策。而我们的所以如此不断反复，正是阶级本质的反映。多少年来习惯了的资本主义的东西不是一下子能够抛弃得了的，必须要长期不断的努力进行自我改造。
    但是在十年现实生活的教育中间，我也得出了一条经验，由于自己还没有得到彻底的改造，资本主义的思想意识就会不断的冒起头来，对党时信时疑，半信半疑，将信将疑；而我们的党是久经考验的党，领导着我们走社会主义的道路，十年来取得了无比宏伟的成就；事实证明，我们相信党的时候总是对的，怀疑党的时候总是错的。因此老老实实的跟着党走，没有差，有些问题没有懂，没有通，先跟着走，逐步的再弄懂、搞通，如果说这是有点迷信，我想对党对真理迷信是件好事，不是坏事。这样就会在我们社会主义的道路中成为助力而不是阻力，成为积极的因素而不是消极的因素。当我们已经看到了去年的大跃进，又眼看到今年必将出现的更大跃进，再瞻望以后一年年的大跃进，把我们的国家从“一穷二白”的面貌改造成为没有剥削、没有压迫的世界上最繁荣幸福的社会之一，人人心花怒放，个个长命百岁，而我们都能为这样的事业贡献了自己的力量，这真是利人利己的好事，将是多么的愉快！
    我在党的教育培养之下，接受改造已经十年，党始终对我深切的关怀，不倦的教育，寄予殷切的期望，在工作上、生活上、政治上作了很好的安排，优厚的照顾，虽然我也曾做了一些工作，但也犯了不少错误，感到非常惭愧。可是，“往者已矣，来者可追”，今后一定积极地在参加社会主义建设的工作中，继续进行自我教育和自我改造，首先就是积极投入今年的增产节约的全民运动中去，学那萧桂英杀家时候的精神，大干一场。
    十年来党对工商业者的改造，使我们愈来愈信任党，愈来愈靠拢党，使我们深切体会到党的和平改造的方针的正确伟大。现在西藏也将逐步进行民主改革和社会改革，我相信党一定会根据西藏的具体情况，同样贯彻和平改造的方针，这一定也会为西藏的上中层爱国进步人士像我们一样的欢迎和赞成的。
    西藏的落后的农奴制度，使得大多数的西藏人民过着暗无天日的生活，实在是和社会发展的距离太远了，这样的制度继续保存下去，像火山一样，总有一天会爆发的。但是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却梦想永远保存这样落后的农奴制度来残酷的剥削、奴役人民，竟敢勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派劫持达赖喇嘛，发动武装叛乱，这是我们全国各族人民包括西藏人民在内所不能容忍和坚决反对的。我完全拥护政府对平息西藏叛乱事件所采取的一切措施、彻底扫荡叛匪。
    令人愤慨的是在我们伟大的邻邦印度居然也出现了一些扩张主义分子，装扮得似“大慈大悲”的样子，大叫大嚷什么“西藏独立”，把叛乱说成是“西藏爱国情绪的流露”，公然反对我国平息叛乱，无耻地宣称印度应继承英帝国主义对西藏的“垄断权利”，企图插手进来，“混水摸鱼”。更可恼的是印度的某些政府官员跟着叛乱分子，殷勤招待，随侍在侧之余，还要一再散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，甚至纵容暴徒污辱我们领袖的像片。这种荒谬行径，如果出自帝国主义者是不足为怪的，它们原来就是反对我们的，可是现在却是出现在同我们友好的印度。他们忘怀了早在印度为英帝国主义侵占的时候，帝国主义者亦没有能够把西藏从中国分裂出去；他们忘怀了中印两国有着二千年和睦相处的历史，首倡和平共处的五项原则；他们忘怀了广大爱好和平的印度人民是站在正义事业一边的；他们忘怀了中国六亿五千万人民是不容任何国家来干涉内政的。奉劝印度的扩张主义老爷们赶快缩回你那肮脏的手罢，好客的中国人民同时也是捉扒儿手的能手，西藏是中国的领土，中国的内政是不容任何人干涉的。
