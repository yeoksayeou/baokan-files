Comrade Hong Shunli's Speech

Chairman, esteemed delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and all other reports, and I firmly support all the measures taken by the Central People's Government against the rebellion of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique. I am a militiaman on the Fujian coastal defense front and am extremely indignant at the conspiracies and despicable actions of British imperialism and Indian expansionist elements in interfering in our country's internal affairs. I also express my resolute opposition. Now, please allow me to report to the congress on the situation of unity and struggle against the enemy by the military and civilians on the Fujian front.

Dadeng, Xiaodeng, and Jiaoyu Islands are important forward positions on the Fujian coastal defense front for fighting against the enemy, facing the enemy-occupied islands of Da and Xiao Jinmen, with the closest distance being only over 1,800 meters. The three islands have a total of more than 8,500 residents, with more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land. Most of the residents are fishermen and farmers, and the rest are salt workers and boat people. Over the past few years, the people of the three islands and the heroic and powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed on the islands have established a blood-like connection in production and construction and in the struggle against the enemy, working hand in hand in production, cooperating in combat, and being as close as a family. They have achieved a series of major victories in both areas. This once again proves the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking on people's war and people's army; at the same time, it is also a glorious victory for the Party's general line for building socialism.

PLA Troops Stationed on the Three Islands Help the Masses in Production;全民皆兵 Consolidates National Defense

Since liberation, the soldiers and civilians on the three islands have regarded consolidating national defense and promoting production and construction as their common tasks. The troops stationed on the islands not only shoulder the glorious task of defending the coast but also regard building the three islands as their sacred mission, caring for the production and life of the masses everywhere and actively and enthusiastically helping the people of the three islands in various production and construction projects. In the past year alone, they helped the masses accumulate fertilizer and carry sand (to improve the soil), amounting to more than 100,000 dan. When the masses urgently needed to solve the water source problem during the summer drought, under the personal leadership of a staff officer of a certain unit, the soldiers helped the masses repair and dig more than 100 wells day and night. Moreover, they used a large amount of materials and even contributed their personal allowances to support the people of the three islands in building water conservancy projects. When the masses lacked labor for deep plowing, the troops used manpower to pull plows and help level the land. When the masses went out to sea to fish, the troops took the initiative to carry out maritime patrols, and sometimes sent forces to be incorporated into various production groups to protect fishing and defend production. With the help of the troops, the people of the three islands have basically eliminated illiteracy. The troops regard the suffering of the masses as their own suffering. When a woman, Wu Lianye, suffered from a difficult disease, the troop doctor spent more than a month patiently and meticulously treating her, and used many precious medicines to finally cure the disease. She said with emotion: "Without the People's Liberation Army, I would not be able to live, and even my nursing child would not be able to survive. The People's Liberation Army saved my whole family." In addition, the troops often help the masses plant trees and afforest, build houses, train militiamen, and train medical personnel, etc. The people of the three islands are very grateful for the selfless support and cordial care of the troops. The People's Liberation Army stationed on the islands truly plays the role of both a fighting force and a working force. In the past, the people of the three islands suffered oppression and bullying under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, they were often subjected to enemy bombing and shelling. They clearly realized that to live a good life, there must be a solid national defense, and there must be a resolute struggle against the enemy. Therefore, the people of the three islands also regard consolidating national defense as their own task. First of all,全民皆兵 was realized. With the help of the troops, more than 800 core militiamen were organized and trained. In live ammunition shooting exercises with light and heavy machine guns, submachine guns, and rifles, more than 70% achieved excellent results. They can not only shoot guns, but also fire artillery. Many militiamen have become reserve artillerymen for the troops. The female militia artillery squad hit all enemy targets in 25 rapid consecutive shots. The militiamen cooperate with the troops stationed on the islands to carry out sentry duty, guard posts, and patrols, tightly guarding the coast, turning the three islands into an impregnable fortress. Over the past few years, they have captured more than 70 enemy frogmen and special agents. No reactionaries or bad elements can escape this dragnet. Once, when I and Hong Kunying and others went out to sea to fish, we discovered two sea bandits. We used fishing rods as weapons to capture them alive. Secondly, in every battle, the people of the three islands use the greatest strength to support the troops in combat. Especially in August and September last year, in order to support the troops in severely punishing Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, the people of the three islands, regardless of men, women, old, and young, organized a large amount of manpower and material resources and went all out to support the front. Many moving events and heroic figures emerged. In one artillery battle, militiaman Zhou Mourong used his body to protect a political instructor of the troops and rescued three wounded soldiers from the artillery fire. The little hero Zhang Qingshi, in order to avenge his father, not only participated in sentry duty and guard posts day and night, but also braved the enemy's heavy artillery fire to reconnect telephone lines for more than three li. The heroine Li Aihua had only had a miscarriage a few days before. She carried her mother-in-law on her back to participate in supporting the front. She slipped and fell five times in a row, and finally fainted in the mud. Comrades advised her to rest, but she resolutely refused and said: "In order to win the battle, a little hardship is nothing." In battles, the people of the three islands not only actively and vigorously support the front, but also directly participate in the war. Over the past few years, they have cooperated with the troops to repel the bandits who came to harass them many times. In August 1954, I and militiaman Zhang Shuiji and others cooperated with the reconnaissance troops of the People's Liberation Army to sail to Jinmen in fishing boats, eliminated a squad of the enemy, and captured the enemy squad leader alive. In one artillery battle last year, militiaman Cai Liangli saw that an artilleryman of the troops was injured, so he immediately replaced the artilleryman to continue attacking the enemy, and was praised by the leaders of the troops. Therefore, the troops call the militiamen the second People's Liberation Army.

The Military and Civilians Care for Each Other Like Family; Intensify Production to Strive for Greater Victories

Over the past few years, the soldiers and civilians on the three islands have taken up guns in one hand and hoes in the other, fighting together and working together. They are not only linked together under the common task of consolidating national defense and promoting production and construction, but also integrated into a family in terms of ideological feelings and life. The military and civilians often care for and take care of each other. For example, if the troops lack something, the masses will immediately send it to their door. If the masses have any difficulties, the troops will also take the initiative to help solve them. The troops help the masses chop firewood and carry water, and the masses wash clothes and sew for the troops. This is very common. The troops and the masses have also jointly organized an amateur cultural troupe, and the military and civilians often gather together for entertainment. Many comrades in the troops have learned to speak the local dialect, and many of the masses have also learned to speak Mandarin. Now we are intensifying production on the one hand, and intensifying training on the other, continuing to carry forward the revolutionary fighting friendship and close cooperation, and striving to achieve even more brilliant victories in production and construction and in the struggle against the enemy in 1959.

Finally, please allow me to represent the soldiers and civilians on the three islands in wishing the beloved Chairman Mao and all the delegates good health.

    同战斗　共劳动　三岛军民如一家
    洪顺利代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告，并坚决拥护中央人民政府对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的叛乱行为所采取的一切措施。我是福建海防前线的一个民兵，对英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的阴谋活动和卑鄙行为，极为愤慨，我也表示坚决地反对。现在，请让我将福建前线军民团结和对敌斗争的情况向大会作汇报。
    大嶝、小嶝、角屿三岛，是福建海防前线对敌斗争的一个重要前哨阵地，面对敌占岛大、小金门，最近距离只有一千八百多公尺。三岛共有居民八千五百多人，耕地六千多亩，居民大部是渔民又是农民，其余是盐民和船民。几年来，三岛人民与英勇强大的中国人民解放军驻岛部队在生产建设和对敌斗争中，建立了血肉般的联系，携手生产，协同作战，亲如一家，并在这两方面取得了一连串的重大胜利。这又一次地证明了毛主席的人民战争、人民军队战略思想的英明正确；同时也是党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉胜利。
    三岛驻军帮助群众生产全民皆兵巩固祖国海防
    解放以来，三岛军民就把巩固国防和生产建设看作是自己的共同任务。驻岛部队不但担负着保卫海防的光荣任务，而且把建设三岛也当作自己的神圣使命，像建设自己的家乡一样，处处关心群众的生产和生活，积极热情地帮助三岛人民进行各项生产建设。仅去年一年中，帮助群众积肥、挑沙（改良土壤）即达十几万担；夏季天旱时，群众急需解决水源，在某部队参谋长亲自率领下，战士们不分昼夜地帮助群众修挖水井一百多个，不仅如此，还以大量的物资甚至献出自己个人的津贴费来支援三岛人民兴修水利；群众深翻土劳力不足时，部队就用人力来拉犁，帮助平整土地；群众下海捕鱼时，部队主动担任海上警戒，有时还派出力量编到各生产小组进行护渔，保卫生产；三岛人民在部队的帮助下，目前已基本上扫除了文盲；部队把群众的痛苦看成是自己的痛苦，妇女吴莲叶生了一个难治的病，部队医生花了一个多月的时间给她耐心细致的医治，并用了不少贵重的药品终于把病治好。她感动的说：“没有解放军，我是活不下去的，连吃奶的孩子也活不成，解放军救了我全家。”此外，部队还经常帮助群众植树造林，修建房屋、训练民兵和培养医务人员等等，三岛群众对部队无私的支援和亲切的关怀，十分感激，驻岛人民解放军是真正起到了既是战斗队又是工作队的作用。三岛人民过去在国民党反动统治下受尽了压迫和欺凌，解放后又经常遭到敌人的轰炸和炮击，清楚地认识到要过好的生活，就要有巩固的国防，就要和敌人进行坚决的斗争，因此，三岛人民把巩固国防也看作是自己的任务。首先实现了全民皆兵，在部队的帮助下，组织训练了基干民兵八百多人，他们在轻、重机枪、冲锋枪和步枪实弹射击演习中，成绩优秀的占百分之七十以上；他们不但能打枪，而且还能打炮，有不少民兵成为部队的预备炮手；民兵女炮班在二十五发急续射中，全部命中敌人的目标。民兵配合驻岛部队进行站岗、放哨、巡逻，严密的守卫着海防，把三岛构成铁壁铜墙，几年来，先后捕获了敌人派来的水鬼特务达七十多名，没有一个反、坏分子能逃出这天罗地网，有一次我和洪坤英等下海捕鱼，发现了两个海匪，我们把鱼钓作武器把他们活捉了。其次在每次战斗中，三岛人民均以最大的力量来支援部队作战，特别是去年八、九月间，为了支援部队严惩蒋贼军，三岛人民不分男女老幼，组织了大批人力、物力，全力投入支前，出现了许多动人的事例和英雄人物，民兵周谋荣在一次炮战中，他用自己的身体护住了部队的一个指导员，并从炮火中救出三个部队的伤员，小英雄张清狮为了替父亲报仇，不仅日夜参加站岗、放哨，有一次并冒着敌人的严密炮火抢接电话线三里多路；女英雄李爱花刚流产没几天，她背着婆婆去参加支前，一连滑倒五次，最后晕倒在泥水里，同志们劝她休息，她坚决不肯，并说：“为了打胜仗，苦一点算不了什么。”三岛人民在战斗中，不仅积极大力支前，而且还直接参战，几年来，曾配合部队多次击退前来袭扰的股匪；在一九五四年八月间，我曾和民兵张水绩等配合解放军侦察部队用渔船开到金门，消灭了敌人一个班，并活捉了敌人班长一名；去年一次炮战时，民兵蔡良力看到部队一个炮手受伤，他立即代替这个炮手继续打击敌人，受到部队首长的表扬。因此，部队把民兵称为第二解放军。
    军民互相关心亲如家人加紧生产争取更大胜利
    几年来，三岛军民一手拿枪，一手拿锄头，同战斗，同劳动，不但在巩固国防和生产建设这个共同任务下联结在一起，而且在思想感情和生活上，也融洽成一家。军民之间经常相互关怀照顾，如部队缺什么东西用，群众就马上送上门，群众有什么困难，部队也主动的帮助解决，部队帮群众砍柴、挑水，群众给部队洗衣、缝拆，这是很平常的事；部队和群众还共同组织了一个业余文工团，军民经常在一起联欢；有不少的部队同志已学会了讲地方话，群众也有不少的学会了讲普通话。现在我们正一面加紧生产，一面加紧训练，继续发扬革命的战斗友谊和亲密协作的精神，争取一九五九年在生产建设和对敌斗争中，获得更加辉煌的胜利。
    最后请允许我代表三岛军民祝敬爱的毛主席和各位代表身体健康。
