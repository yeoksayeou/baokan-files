Prevention is the Best Policy
Kong Sang

To guarantee the quality of products and projects, "prevention"—that is, making good production preparations in advance—is the best policy. Planning ahead saves labor, materials, and time, fully meeting the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Moreover, the initiative and peace of mind that come with it are invaluable. Therefore, in grasping quality, we must establish the idea of "prevention" and vigorously promote the method of "prevention." Technical research associations, improved operating procedures, meticulous production preparation work, "three-way combination" debates and experiments, regular equipment maintenance and repair work, technical education for new workers and apprentices, etc., are all good methods. The Shenyang Jianxing Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory, using only a few methods, has consistently maintained a very high pass rate in the foundry industry, where quality is notoriously difficult to guarantee. The power of "prevention" is evident from this.

"Prevention," or advance preparation, is essential for normal production. There is another method called "inspection," which is post-event checking, discarding bad products and reworking substandard ones. This is also essential for normal production. This method can both act as a gatekeeper and guide us to find the root cause of scrap and rework, and learn lessons. Therefore, grasping quality must involve both prevention and inspection.

In fact, from a practical point of view, problems arising from inspection lead to the proposal of preventive measures. Only after being a "Monday morning quarterback" many times can one achieve "foresight." Repairing the fold after losing sheep is a passive measure for the last time, but an active "prevention" for the next. Didn't the "four checks, four cleans, and eight good inversions" operating method of the Jianxing Punching and Shearing Machine Tool Factory come about after studying the eight major problems that frequently caused defective products? Without past failures, the technical research association might not have anticipated what difficulties would be encountered and how to prevent them. As the saying goes, failure is the mother of success, and "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit" illustrates this point. We must have both the practice of planning ahead and the spirit of mending the fold after losing sheep. To achieve effective "prevention," we must first value the lessons of failure. In this sense, the quality inspection system is a most proactive system.

In order to improve product and project quality, many factories have launched high-quality and high-yield campaigns. Factories and mines that have not yet taken action should catch up, check the current state of product quality in their units, find experiences and lessons, improve rules and regulations, and effectively ensure high quality and high yield. In this way, we can expect to achieve a complete victory of high quality and high yield in the near future.

    预防是上策
    孔桑
    保证产品和工程的质量，“预防”——也即是事先作好生产准备，是个上策。未雨绸缪，既省工，又省料，又不耽误时间，完全符合多快好省的要求；更不用说工作的主动，心情之舒畅，也随之而俱来。因此，在抓质量当中，我们要树立“预防”的思想，大力提倡“预防”的方法。技术研究会、完善的操作规程，细致的生产准备工作，“三结合”的辩论和试验，经常的设备维护和检修工作，对新工人和学徒的技术教育等等，都是好方法。沈阳建兴冲剪机床厂只用了几种方法，就在很不容易保证质量的翻砂这一行中，做到了经常保持很高的合格率。“预防”的效力之大，于此可见。
    “预防”，事先准备，这是正常生产所必需的。还有一种方法，曰“检验”，即事后检查，发现坏的报废，不合格的返工。这也是正常生产所必需的。这种方法既可以起把守关口的作用，也可以引导我们去找到报废返工的根源，找到教训。因此，抓质量必须既抓预防，又抓检验。
    其实，从实践的观点看来，从检验中发生问题，才会提出预防的办法。只有做了多次的“事后诸葛亮”，才有可能做到事前“料事如神”。亡羊补牢，对上一次来说，是消极的处置，对下一次来说，就是积极的“预防”。建兴冲剪机床厂的“四检四净八好倒”操作方法，不就是在研究了经常出废品的八大毛病之后才制订出来的么？过去没有过失败的教训，技术研究会也未必能预料到会碰到什么困难，如何防止。常言说，失败是成功之母，吃一堑长一智，就是这个道理。我们既要有未雨绸缪的做法，也要有亡羊补牢的精神。要做到有效的“预防”，必须首先重视失败的教训。从这个意义上说，质量检验制度正是一个最积极的制度。
    为了提高产品和工程质量，很多工厂已经展开了优质高产运动。还没有动起来的厂矿，应当迎头赶上，检查一下本单位产品质量状况倒底怎样，找出经验教训，健全规章制度，切实保证优质高产。这样，我们就可以期望在不久的将来，能够获得优质高产的全线胜利。
