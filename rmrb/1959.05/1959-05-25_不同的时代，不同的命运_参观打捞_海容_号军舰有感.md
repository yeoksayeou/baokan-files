Different Times, Different Destinies
    ——Thoughts on Visiting the Salvaged "Hairong" Warship
    Bai Wei
    One early summer evening, we went to the Jiangyin Fortress to visit the salvaged sunken ship. We set off by boat from Beiguan in Jiangyin, and after sailing north along Huangdi Port for only a few minutes, we reached the once prominent blockade line of Jiangyin Fortress. Before us was a vast river, surging and mighty, with countless fishing boats and ships moving to and fro amidst the misty waves. They moved freely on the river, unaware that forty-eight warships and merchant ships were buried in the depths of the river.

    Speaking of Jiangyin Fortress, it is somewhat laughable. More than twenty years ago, Chiang Kai-shek, under the pretext of consolidating "national defense," plundered the people's wealth and spent huge sums of money over several years to build a "national defense" project here, known as an impregnable copper wall and iron barrier, to control the throat of the Yangtze River. It is said that this plan was proposed by Hitler's German military advisory group. But it is also said that the same group of advisors sold the fortress map to the Japanese imperialists. Even more ridiculous is that such a huge "national defense" project never fired a single shot during the eight years of the War of Resistance. When Shanghai was in dire straits and Nanjing was in imminent danger, Chiang Kai-shek had the brilliant idea of sinking a full forty-eight warships and merchant ships to the bottom of the river, completing the so-called first line of blockade on the Yangtze River, in an attempt to prevent the Japanese invaders from moving upstream along the river and directly attacking Nanjing. However, what was the result? The Japanese invaders did not take it seriously at all. After the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese invaders bypassed and attacked Jinling. After the Battle of Jurong, Nanjing was abandoned. The so-called copper wall and iron barrier of the Jiangyin Fortress blockade line was thus declared dead.

    Now let's talk about these forty-eight warships and merchant ships sunk at the bottom of the river. Calculating each ship at 5,000 tons, the total number is about 200,000 to 300,000 tons. This is a considerable amount of wealth. Allowing it to be buried in the river is not only a pity, but also obstructs navigation and sometimes causes minor accidents to passing ships. In view of this, the Shanghai Salvage Engineering Bureau undertook the task of salvaging them. Over the years, they have organized batch after batch of salvage engineering teams, stirring up the river and fighting day and night with the raging waves, with the aim of clearing the waterway and resurrecting these ships that have been sunk for more than twenty years, one by one, to serve the cause of socialist construction. This is a great and arduous project. On the day of our visit, there were exactly three ships being salvaged at the same time: one warship had already been lifted out of the water; the second cargo ship was pressed on top of another cargo ship, and had already been shattered to pieces, with only some remnants salvaged; the cargo ship that was pressed underneath was now working hard to float. We changed into waterproof clothing on the work boat and went down to the warship that had just been salvaged, but was still in a semi-floating and semi-sinking state, with the hull slightly tilted and covered in mud and rust. Comrades from the engineering team told us that this was the "Hairong" warship, of about 5,000 tons, built in Germany in 1914, and 90 meters long. We only visited the first layer of the cabin and could not go down any further, because the three or four layers of cabins below were still filled with mud, sand and water, and the brave divers were working in the cabins, which were floating with iridescent oil, to plug the leaks and pump water.

    What we saw on the deck was a broken warship that had been disarmed, had lost its combat capability, and had lost its ability to navigate. The bridge was broken, the cannons were gone, leaving only some dilapidated shell casings and daily necessities for naval use, such as binoculars covered in verdigris, dull Kuomintang cap badges, old-fashioned decorative wall lamps, and ammunition compartment keys with chains. Among these salvaged items, there were actually also voluminous files. Among them were the Kuomintang "Rosters of Gunboats under the Naval Department," "Register of Employees of the Mawei Shipyard," "Register of Employees of the Jiangnan Shipyard," "Roster of Officers and Men of the Second Fleet Headquarters and Subordinate Ships of the Naval Department," and the "Naval Gazette" of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933). Strangely, although these files had been stained by water for more than twenty years, the paper and printing were still intact, and the handwriting had not changed at all, except that they were sealed by silt around the edges, and looked like a complete adobe brick. They only needed to be dried slightly to be peeled off page by page. I was very surprised to see this, and could not help but make some comments, saying that this showed how embarrassed the Kuomintang was when they retreated in a hurry, and that they did not even have time to destroy important files. Unexpectedly, my words aroused the interest of a sailor, who smiled humorously and said: "They can't even save their own lives, what do they need these for!"

    We cannot say what type of warship the "Hairong" belonged to. In short, it was definitely not a flagship or aircraft carrier. But judging from its old face, it can be said that it has been through many risks. The world only knows that people who fall into the river or ships that sink into the sea are said to be "buried in the belly of fish," but who knows that the "Hairong" has been sunk in the river for more than twenty years and has become a base camp for shrimps, crabs and other aquatic creatures? According to the divers who personally participated in the salvage of the "Hairong," when it was about to float, all the cabins on the ship were filled with aquatic animals. The fish and shrimp that they caught with sacks alone weighed five or six hundred pounds. This is enough to illustrate the life and experience of the "Hairong." In the era of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, a dignified warship ended up in such a situation. But then again, history is ultimately merciless, like the rolling Yangtze River flowing eastward, never to return. The "Hairong" has now been liberated. Once it is completely out of the water, it will be sent to the shipyard to heal its wounds, refit it, and serve our cause of peace and socialism. Here, I wish our heroic salvage engineering team sailors, and congratulate them on clearing the waterway as soon as possible, making every ship, like the "Hairong," come back to life and see the light of day again.

    不同的时代，不同的命运
    ——参观打捞“海容”号军舰有感
    白危
    一个初夏的傍晚，我们去江阴要塞参观打捞沉船。从江阴北关乘船出发，沿黄地港向北行驶，不消几分钟便出了港口，来到历史上曾经显赫一时的江阴要塞封锁线。只见眼前一派大江，浩浩荡荡，数不尽的渔舟和船舶在烟波浩渺中出没。它们在江面上来往自如，哪里晓得大江之中埋葬着四十八艘军舰和商船。
    提起江阴要塞，说来未免令人啼笑皆非。二十多年前，蒋介石借口巩固“国防”，搜刮民脂民膏，耗资巨万，费时数年，在这里修筑了一道号称铜墙铁壁、扼住长江咽喉要道的“国防”工事。据说这计划还是希特勒的德国军事顾问团献的。但后来出卖这要塞图给日本帝国主义的，据说也是这批顾问。更可笑的是，这样一个偌大的“国防”工事，抗战八年，却从来没有放过一炮。当上海吃紧，南京告急时，蒋介石竟又妙想天开，把整整四十八艘军舰和商船凿沉江底，完成所谓长江第一道封锁线，企图以此来阻止日寇沿江上溯，直捣南京。然而，结果怎样呢？日寇压根儿不把它放在眼里。上海失陷后，日寇绕道袭击金陵，句容一役，南京弃守，所谓铜墙铁壁的江阴要塞封锁线，至此也就宣告寿终正寝了。
    如今且说这四十八艘沉没在江底里的军舰和商船，以每艘五千吨计算，总数约在二、三十万吨。这是一笔为数不少的财富，让它埋没江中，非但可惜，而且阻塞航道，有时还使来往船只发生一点小事故。上海打捞工程局有鉴于此，便承担了打捞它们的任务。这些年来，组织了一批又一批的打捞工程队，在这里翻江搅海，日夜和惊涛骇浪搏斗，目的就是为了扫清航道，把这些沉没了二十多年的舰船，一艘艘都使它复活过来，为社会主义建设事业服务。这是一个伟大而又艰巨的工程。我们去参观的这一天，恰好有三艘舰船同时在打捞：其中一艘军舰已经起出水面；第二艘货轮压在另一艘货轮上，业已粉身碎骨，只捞出一些残也；那艘被压在底下的货轮，现在正在紧张地作起浮工作。我们在工作船上换上防水衣，下到那艘刚刚打捞出来，但仍在半浮半沉状态，舰身稍微有点倾斜，满身污泥和锈损不堪的军舰上。工程队的同志告诉我们，这是一艘五千吨级左右的“海容”号军舰，1914年德国造，舰长九十公尺。我们只参观到第一层舱就下不去了，因为底下三、四层舱都还充满了泥沙和积水，英勇的潜水员们正在那漂浮着蓝闪闪的机油的船舱里进行堵塞漏洞和抽水工作。
    我们在甲板上看到的是已经解除了武装，失去了战斗能力，失去了航行能力的破烂军舰。舰桥折断了，大炮不见了，只剩下一些残破不堪的炮弹壳和海军用的日常物品，诸如上了铜青的望远镜，黯然无光的青天白日帽徽，古旧的装饰壁灯，带有链环的弹药舱钥匙。在这些打捞出来的物品当中，居然也夹杂着成篇累牍的档案。其中有国民党“海军部各炮艇所属花名册”，“马尾造船所职员录”，“江南造船所职员录”，“海军部第二舰队司令部暨所属各舰职员录”和民国二十二年的“海军公报”等。奇怪的是这些档案虽然被水渍了二十多年，但纸张印刷依然完整无缺，字迹也丝毫未变，只不过四周被淤泥密封，外表很像一块完整的土坯，只须略一风干，便能一页一页地揭开来。我看了甚是奇怪，不免空发一些议论，说由此可见当时国民党仓皇撤退时，狼狈到什么程度，竟连重要档案也来不及销毁。不料我的话却引起一位海员的兴趣，他幽默地微笑着说：“他们自己的命都保不住，还要这些干什么呀！”
      “海容”号究竟属于哪一种类型的军舰，我们说不上来。总之决不是什么旗舰或航空母舰。但从它那衰老的容颜看来，也可说得上饱经风险了。世人只知道人掉在江里或船沉在大海里叫做“葬身鱼腹”，那晓得“海容”号沉没江里二十多年，却成了虾兵蟹将的大本营？据亲身参加打捞“海容”号的潜水员说，当它起浮之前，舰上各个舱里都住满了水族动物，单是给他们用麻袋逮住的鱼虾就有五、六百斤之多。这也足以说明“海容”号的身世和遭遇，在国民党反动统治的年代里，堂堂一艘军舰也只落得如此下场。不过话又说回来，历史终究是无情的，就像滚滚长江东逝水，永远不会回来了。“海容”号现在已经被解放，一俟全部出水，就要送进船坞，给它医治创伤，把它重新装配起来，为我们的和平和社会主义事业服务。我在这里预祝我们的英勇的打捞工程队的海员们，祝贺他们早日扫清航道，把每一艘舰船都像“海容”号一样，使它起死回生，重见天日。
