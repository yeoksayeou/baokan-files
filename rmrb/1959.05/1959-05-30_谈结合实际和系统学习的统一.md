    On the Unity of Combining Theory with Practice and Systematic Study
    Xie Pingze

    Some people, in order to oppose the policy of combining theory with practice, once fabricated an excuse, saying that once theory is linked to practice, it will destroy the theory's systematicness, scientific nature, logicality, and so on. We must not believe that these people truly want to maintain the systematicness, scientific nature, and logicality of theory. The essence of this argument lies in separating theory from practice and should be thoroughly criticized.

    Everyone knows that Marxist theory is not a dogma that fell from the sky, but a summary of actual struggles and a guide to action. Therefore, when we study and research Marxism, we cannot be divorced from reality, we cannot just recite its concepts and formulas, but we must combine it with reality, we must purposefully understand the spirit of Marxism, and use it to analyze, explain, and solve various practical problems.

    People also know that Marxist theory is a science, which is different from fragmented knowledge, different from bits and pieces of experience, and not a pile of concepts and formulas, but has its rigorous and complete system. As Lenin said when discussing "The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism": "It is fully coherent and complete, providing people with a complete worldview that is absolutely irreconcilable with any superstition, any reaction, and any thought defending bourgeois oppression."

    That is to say, Marxism is composed of several indispensable parts, such as philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism; in Marxist philosophy, there are materialism, dialectics, and historical materialism; its various components have inherent and inevitable connections; and it has its historical stages and order of development. Therefore, if we want to master Marxism as a science, in addition to combining it with practice, we must also study and research it systematically, step by step, historically, and comprehensively.

    Of course, our understanding of the system of theory is not a rigid form; so-called systematic study does not mean that the order of learning content cannot be changed at all, and the learning time cannot be interrupted in the slightest. The systematic study we require is first and foremost combined with practice, and is in terms of the entire learning process. Generally speaking, its basic requirements are three:

    First, there must be step-by-step and planned study. That is, we should follow the system of theory, honestly learn from the shallow to the deep, from the low to the high, from the one-sided to the comprehensive, step by step and gradually, and not be overambitious and learn things in a scattered and chaotic way. This way, we can lay a good foundation and improve and deepen step by step.

    Second, we must study and research all issues and principles historically. In Lenin's words, we must "examine each issue according to how a certain phenomenon arose historically, and what main stages it went through in its development, and observe what this phenomenon has become now based on its development." Only in this way can we understand the ins and outs of all issues and principles, and can we specifically grasp the spirit of Marxism from development.

    Third, we must comprehensively understand the basic principles of Marxism. We must not divide the various parts and principles of Marxism, treat them in isolation, or arbitrarily discard anything, but must completely grasp its entire content. Only in this way can we draw inferences about other cases and grasp the essence of the problem.

    Some comrades say: it is enough to "learn whatever you do," and there is no need for systematic study. Here, two questions need to be clarified: First, how should we absorb the experience of "learn whatever you do"? Second, is systematically studying theory optional?

    No one denies that many comrades have achieved certain results in implementing "learn whatever you do," and some have even achieved immediate results. However, how should this experience be summarized? One view is that "learn whatever you do" is the most direct way to solve problems, and is the only correct learning method, so there is no need to systematically study basic theory. Another view is that the basic spirit of "learn whatever you do" lies in the combination of theory and practice. If we narrowly understand "do what" and only "learn what," then it can only lead to one-sided and piecemeal knowledge. On the contrary, if we understand "learn whatever you do" as both linking theory with practice and systematically studying theory, this is the correct learning method. I think only the latter view is correct.

    As for whether systematically studying theory is optional, the issue is very clear: if we do not comprehensively grasp Marxist theory, it is impossible to truly establish a complete Marxist worldview; and to comprehensively grasp it, we must systematically study theory. Taking Marxist philosophy as an example, only by comprehensively understanding materialism and dialectics can we lay the foundation for a dialectical materialist worldview. Otherwise, if we only learn materialism and discard dialectics, we may make the mistake of mechanical materialism; or if we only learn dialectics and discard materialism, we may make the mistake of idealism and sophistry. The establishment of a viewpoint is also the same. For example, the viewpoint of the unity of opposites. If we only understand that contradictions are opposing, but do not understand that contradictions are both opposing and unified, both struggling and identical, then we cannot have a correct understanding. It can be seen that whether or not to systematically study theory is a question of whether or not the Marxist worldview can be established completely. Moreover, if we do not comprehensively grasp the Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method, it is impossible to correctly and effectively solve practical problems. For example, some comrades only understand that subjective initiative is great, but do not understand that objective laws must be respected; or only understand the theory of continuous revolution, but do not understand the theory of stages of revolutionary development, and so on, and thus made some mistakes in practical work, which is the reason. Just like a carpenter doing work, he cannot only use an axe or only use a saw, but must have the cooperation of his entire set of tools. Fragmented knowledge is not only incomplete, but it is also bound to only know what is happening and not why, and therefore cannot correctly and effectively solve practical problems.

    Sometimes, people feel that their weapons are insufficient and their hands and brains are not flexible in their work, which is often a manifestation of a lack of basic Marxist knowledge and a failure to integrate and understand it. To change this situation, we must combine theory with practice and systematically study theory. As Comrade Mao Zedong said during the War of Resistance Against Japan: "If our party has one hundred to two hundred comrades who have learned Marxism-Leninism systematically rather than piecemeal, practically rather than empty-headed, it will greatly increase our party's combat power and accelerate our work in defeating Japanese imperialism."

    Thinking of today's Great Leap Forward situation, thinking of the many new problems that need to be researched, explained, and solved, then we must have more "comrades who have learned Marxism-Leninism systematically rather than piecemeal, practically rather than empty-headed," so that we can greatly increase our party's combat effectiveness and greatly accelerate socialist construction.

    谈结合实际和系统学习的统一
    谢平仄
    有些人为了反对理论与实际相结合的方针，曾经制造了一种借口，说什么理论一旦联系实际，就会破坏理论的系统性、科学性、逻辑性等等。我们不要相信这些人真想维护理论的系统性、科学性和逻辑性。这种论调的本质，在于把理论和实际割裂开来，应当彻底批判。
    谁都知道：马克思主义理论，不是从天而降的教条，而是对实际斗争的总结，是行动的指南。所以我们学习和研究马克思主义，就不能脱离实际，就不能只背诵它的概念和公式，而必须结合实际，必须有的放矢地领会马克思主义的精神实质，并运用它去分析、去说明、去解决各种实际问题。
    人们同时也知道，马克思主义理论是一门科学，它不同于片断的知识，不同于点滴的经验，也不是一群概念和公式的堆砌，而有其严密完整的体系。像列宁在论述“马克思主义的三个来源与三个组成部分”时所说的：“它十分完备而严整，给了人们一个决不同于任何迷信、任何反动、任何辩护资产阶级压迫的思想相调和的完整世界观。”
    这就是说，马克思主义是由若干不可缺少的部分组成的，像哲学、政治经济学、科学社会主义等；在马克思主义哲学中，又有唯物主义、辩证法、历史唯物主义等；它的各个组成部分之间，又有着内在的必然的联系；还有其历史发展的阶段和顺序。因此，我们要想掌握马克思主义这门科学，除了必须结合实际，还必须有步骤地、历史地和全面地，也就是系统地去学习和研究它。
    当然，我们了解的理论的系统，不是死板的形式；所谓系统地学习，也不是学习内容的先后根本不能变换，学习时间丝毫不能间断。我们所要求的系统地学习，首先是结合实际的，而且是就整个学习过程而言的，大体说来，它的基本要求有三：
    一要有步骤、有计划的学习。也就是应该按照理论的系统，老老实实地由浅入深、由低到高、由片面到全面，循序渐进地学习，不要好高骛远和七零八落地胡学一通。这样就能打好基础，步步提高和深入。
    二要历史地学习和研究一切问题和原理，用列宁的话说，就是要“对于每一问题都根据某种现象在历史上怎样产生出来，以及它在发展中经过了怎样一些主要阶段的情形去考察，并根据它的这种发展情形去观察究竟这个现象现在成了什么。”这样才能了解一切问题和原理的来龙去脉，才能从发展中具体地把握马克思主义的精神实质。
    三要全面地领会马克思主义的基本原理，不要把马克思主义的各个部分、各个原理加以割裂，孤立地看待或者任意丢掉什么，而必须完整地掌握它的全部内容。这样也才能触类旁通，抓住问题的本质。
    有的同志说：只要“做什么学什么”就够了，用不着系统的学习。这里提出了两个问题需要澄清：第一、应该怎样吸取“做什么学什么”的经验？第二、系统地学习理论是不是可有可无？
    谁也不否认，许多同志在贯彻“做什么学什么”中，取得了一定的成绩，有的还获得了立竿见影的效果。但是，对于这个经验应该怎样总结呢？一种认为“做什么学什么”，就事论事，最能解决问题，是唯一正确的学习方法，因而用不着系统地学习基础理论了。另一种认为“做什么学什么”的基本精神在于理论和实际的结合。如果狭隘地理解“做什么”就只“学什么”，那就只能使人得到片面的、零星的知识。相反，如果把“做什么学什么”了解为既要作到理论与实际联系，又要作到系统学习理论，这才是正确的学习方法。我看，只有后一种看法是正确的。
    至于系统地学习理论是否可有可无，问题很明显：如果不全面地掌握马克思主义理论，要想真正确立完整的马克思主义世界观是不可能的；而要全面地掌握，就必须系统地学习理论。拿马克思主义哲学来说，只有全面地领会了唯物主义和辩证法，才能打下辩证唯物主义宇宙观的基础。不然，只学了唯物主义，丢了辩证法，就有可能犯机械唯物主义的错误；或者只学了辩证法，丢了唯物主义，就有可能犯唯心主义和诡辩的错误。就是一个观点的确立也是这样，例如对立统一的观点，如果只了解矛盾是对立的，而不了解矛盾既对立又统一、既斗争又同一等等，就不可能有正确的认识。可见，要不要系统地学习理论，是马克思主义世界观能不能完整地建立起来的问题。而且，如果不全面地掌握马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，要想正确而有效地解决实际问题，也是不可能的。像有的同志，只了解主观能动作用大，而不懂得客观规律性必须尊重；或者只了解不断革命论，而不懂得革命发展阶段论等等，因而在实际工作中出了一些毛病，就是这个道理。就像一个木匠做工一样，他不能只用斧头或者只用锯子，而必须是他的一整套工具的协作。片断的知识，不仅是不全面的，而且必然只知其然而不知其所以然，因而也不能正确而有效地解决实际问题。
    人们在工作中，有时感到武器不足，手脑不灵，往往就是马克思主义基础知识缺乏和没有融会贯通的表现。而要改变这种情况，就只有结合实际地、系统地学习理论。毛泽东同志在抗日战争的时候是这样说的：“如果我们党有一百个至二百个系统地而不是零碎地、实际地而不是空洞地学会了马克思列宁主义的同志，就会大大地提高我们党的战斗力量，并加速我们战胜日本帝国主义的工作”。
    想起今天大跃进的形势，想起许许多多新问题需要我们去研究、去说明、去解决，那么我们就得有更多的“系统地而不是零碎地、实际地而不是空洞地学会了马克思列宁主义的同志”，这样才能大大提高我们党的战斗力，也才能大大加速社会主义建设。
