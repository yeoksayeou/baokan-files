Most of Guizhou's ethnic minorities live in remote mountainous areas. The Yao people, with a population of just over ten thousand, live in Yaolu Mountain, which borders the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Despite Yaolu Mountain’s deep valleys and towering peaks, the Yao people have begun to build a beautiful paradise in this high mountain valley.

In May, the scenery on Yaolu Mountain is overwhelming for visitors. The rice seedlings in the paddy fields are a lush green; the ripening wheat on the dam is stirred by the breeze in golden waves. Groups of Yao men and women in black ethnic clothing are in the fields, some harvesting wheat, others plowing the fields to prepare for planting rice. The bold Yao songs resonate through the mountains, accompanied by laughter and the sounds of cattle.

In the middle of the fields is a cluster of tile-roofed houses, with "Helang" (empty house frames and wooden racks used by the Yao people to hang glutinous rice ears, corn ears, etc.) of various sizes standing everywhere in front of and behind the houses, covered with freshly harvested rapeseed from the fields. At several intersections, there are also small granaries.

Life on Yaolu Mountain is getting better year by year. Many Yao elders often recount that a few years ago, more than half of the 1,370 mu of land on Yaolu Mountain was occupied by twelve landlords and rich peasants, and more than 80% of the people lived a life of hired labor. In those years, the Yao people had to use wooden plows and wooden rakes to cultivate the land, rarely or never applying fertilizer, and never learned to grow wheat and rapeseed. Since liberation, the People's Government has distributed free farm tools and loans year after year, and has also sent many agricultural technicians to help the Yao people develop production. By 1956, on the basis of completing the democratic reforms, the Yao people had established advanced agricultural production cooperatives. They all used iron farm tools and new-style farm tools to cultivate the land, universally learned the advanced production techniques of the Han people, and grain harvests were bumper year after year. The Yao people no longer worried about food and clothing. In 1956, the average income per person was 46.84 yuan, which increased to 72.95 yuan in 1958. The 209 households on the mountain have added 353 quilts and more than 200 mosquito nets, and everyone has made new clothes. Many young people also wear sneakers or leather shoes. Yao poor peasant Wei Zhichao, 28 years old, did not have pants to wear when he was 18 before liberation. The three brothers lay in the firewood pile in summer and spent the winter around the fire pit, without clothes or quilts, extremely poor. Now Wei Zhichao is married, and his family of four has four quilts. He has clothes for work and new clothes for festivals. He has grain to eat all year round and lives a good life. Now, except for two households that live in thatched houses on Yaolu Mountain, the remaining 207 households all live in tile-roofed houses.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Yao people have cultivated their own cadres. The Party Secretary of the Guanghui People's Commune, the director of the management area, and the production team leaders on Yaolu Mountain are all Yao people. The Yao people not only actively build their hometown, but also send their children to the interior to support the socialist construction of the motherland. Forty-six Yao youths have gone to work in Guiyang, Beijing, Inner Mongolia and other places. Among them, 30 have entered factories.

On Yaolu Mountain, one can see the beautiful cultural life of the Yao people. Their hunting dance, performed in Duyun City in February this year at the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture ethnic folk art performance, won first prize. This remote mountainous area, like the villages in the interior, now has postmen delivering books and newspapers every day, and radio receivers broadcasting the news of the great leap forward across the country to every corner. The mountainous area also has telephones to maintain close contact with the cities below the mountain.

    瑶麓山上好风光
    新华社记者  鲁兴伦
    贵州的少数民族大都居住在偏僻的山区。只有一万多人的瑶族住在黔南布依族苗族自治州和广西僮族自治区接壤的瑶麓山。别看这座瑶麓山深谷接着深谷，山头接着山头，就在这个高山深谷之中，瑶族人民开始建立了美丽的乐园。
    5月里，瑶麓山上的景色，使来访者应接不暇。秧田里的稻秧一片油绿；坝上黄熟了的小麦被微风吹起金色波浪。田间一群群穿着黑色民族服装的瑶族男女，有的在收割小麦，有的正在犁田准备栽秧。豪放的瑶族歌声伴随欢笑声、喝牛声在山间回荡。
    田坝中间是一片瓦房，屋前屋后到处立着大小不同的“禾浪”（瑶族人民挂糯稻穗、玉米穗等用的空房架和木架子），挂满了新从地里割回来的油菜。在几个岔道口，还有一座座小粮仓。
    瑶麓山的生活一年比一年好。许多瑶族老人常常诉说，几年以前，瑶麓山的一千三百七十多亩土地，一半以上被十二户地主、富农占据着，80％以上的人都过着雇工的痛苦生活。那些年月，瑶族人民不得不使用木犁、木耙耕田，很少施肥或不施肥，从来不会种小麦和油菜。解放以后，人民政府连年发放无偿农具和贷款，又派了不少农业技术人员帮助瑶族人民发展生产。到1956年，瑶族人民在完成民主改革的基础上，建立了高级农业生产合作社。他们都用铁制农具和新式农具耕种，普遍学习了汉族人民先进的生产技术，粮食连年丰收，瑶族人民再也不愁吃穿了。1956年，平均每人收入四十六点八四元，1958年增到七十二点九五元。山上的二百零九户人家已添制了三百五十三床棉被，二百多床蚊帐，个个都制了新衣服，许多青年人还穿上了球鞋或皮鞋。二十八岁的瑶族贫农韦志超，解放前长到十八岁还没有裤子穿，兄弟三人夏天躺在柴禾堆里，冬天围着火堂过夜，无衣无被，贫苦不堪。现在韦志超结婚了，一家四口人有四床棉被，干活时有干活的衣裳，逢年过节还有新衣，一年到头有粮食吃，生活过得很好。现在，瑶麓山上除了两户人家住的是草房外；其余二百零七家都是住的瓦房。
    在共产党和人民政府领导下，瑶族人民已经培养了自己的干部。瑶麓山上的光辉人民公社的党委书记、管理区主任及生产队长，都是瑶族人。瑶胞们不仅积极建设家乡，还把子弟送到内地支援祖国社会主义建设。有四十六个瑶族青年已经到贵阳、北京、内蒙古等地参加工作。其中有三十人进了工厂。
    在瑶麓山上，可以看到瑶族人民美好的文化生活。他们演出的打猎舞，今年2月在都匀市参加黔南布依族苗族自治州民族民间文艺会演时，获得了一等奖。这个边远的山区，现在和内地的村庄一样，每天有邮递员送来书刊和报纸，无线电收音机把祖国各地大跃进的消息播送到每个角落。山区还有电话和山下城市取得密切联系。
