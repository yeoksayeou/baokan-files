Geneva, May 24 (By Our Correspondent Wan Guang) – The East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference will begin its third week of work on the 25th. In the second week, the conference discussed the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany and the Western "package plan." As the second week's meeting approached its end, a spokesman for the Soviet delegation stated at a press conference that after discussions, the positions of both sides were very clear. It was time to end the general discussion and enter into discussions on specific practical issues. The Soviet Union is striving to reach agreements on specific issues, and Western countries should also take practical steps to ensure positive results from the conference.

    In the general discussion of the conference, despite the painstaking efforts of the United States and other Western countries to evade it, the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany was actually the center of the discussion. Western countries repeatedly spoke out against a rapid conclusion of a peace treaty, but they could not offer any convincing arguments. Western countries were on the defensive in the discussion, and they were weak and powerless in defending their own "package plan."

    Currently, to move the conference into discussions on specific practical issues, the first hurdle to overcome is for the Western countries to untie the dead knot they have tied for solving the problem. Many Western newspapers had already discussed that Western countries might be forced to break up their "package plan" in the middle of last week. Some British newspapers have reported that Britain has prepared a plan on the West Berlin issue. However, until the end of last week, Western countries actually still refused to discuss specific issues. According to the London "Times" on the 23rd, this was because Western foreign ministers were still not in agreement on whether to immediately dismantle the "package" "burden." Some countries still stubbornly insisted that they were unwilling to immediately announce the formal death of the newly born "package plan," although it was already a stillborn infant when it was born. At the same time, some newspapers said that this was also because Western foreign ministers were "far from reaching agreement" on what kind of Berlin issue plan they should put forward. Therefore, during the weekend recess, the foreign ministers of the four Western powers had to conduct urgent consultations with their respective governments, and the four-nation working group was also meeting frequently.

    The fact that U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy rushed here in the middle of last week to attend the conference attracted attention. Among the six delegations currently participating in the conference, only the United States has specifically sent a military minister. This is extremely inconsistent with the current task of the conference to ease international tensions. McElroy's statement to reporters upon arriving in Geneva on the 20th also had the tone of a "policy of strength." He emphasized that U.S. military forces had taken "normal precautionary measures."

    Also around the time McElroy came to Geneva, mouthpieces of the U.S. ruling group, such as the "New York Times" and the "New York Herald Tribune," continuously published editorials and articles, clamoring to force the Soviet Union to "make concessions" from a "position of strength," to demand that the Soviet Union "pay a price" for holding a summit conference, otherwise the United States would not participate in the summit conference. The day after McElroy arrived here, Herter also suddenly said at the Foreign Ministers' Conference that the Soviet Union's attitude would lead to a "very serious tense situation."

    With the support of the United States, the West German Adenauer group is stepping up its frantic activities to sabotage the conference. West German Foreign Minister Brentano, who has been engaged in "hotel diplomacy," specifically gave a speech to reporters on the 22nd, openly advocating that the West must agree to hold a summit conference only after the Soviet Union "guarantees" the West's occupation of West Berlin. He also threatened that if the Soviet Union continues to reject the West's "plan for the unification of Germany," the Geneva Conference "may end in failure." After giving this speech, Brentano returned to Bonn on the weekend to discuss new sabotage tactics with Adenauer.

    British bourgeois newspapers on the 22nd and 23rd expressed unease about this adverse current. The "Times" openly pointed out that Brentano's speech "was not approved by other Western foreign ministers in advance." The "Daily Telegraph" emphasized that serious negotiations on practical issues must begin in the third week. An editorial in "The Scotsman" said: "The work of seeking a common position has not yet begun. Some people there (Geneva) seem not to want to start this work at all."

    Some British newspapers expressed a desire not to have the negotiations sabotaged, and some of them even hoped that the British Foreign Secretary would come out to "intervene" in the current situation. However, what has Lloyd's performance been like in the past two weeks? He has constantly retreated under the pressure of allies such as the United States and West Germany, and has repeatedly sided with the United States at the conference. There is reason to suspect whether Lloyd will come up with any ideas in the new week that conform to British public opinion.

### 日内瓦会议上两种外交路线日益分明  苏联力谋在具体问题上达成协议  西方国家却加紧进行阻挠和破坏

    日内瓦会议上两种外交路线日益分明
    苏联力谋在具体问题上达成协议  西方国家却加紧进行阻挠和破坏
    本报日内瓦24日电  记者万光报道：东西方国家外长会议25日将开始第三周的工作。会议在第二周里对苏联提出的对德和约草案和西方的“一揽子计划”进行了讨论。当第二周会议接近结束时，苏联代表团发言人在记者招待会上指出，双方的立场经过讨论，已经很清楚。应该结束一般性讨论，而进入具体的实际问题的讨论了。苏联正在尽力谋求在具体问题上达成协议，西方国家也应该采取实际步骤，使得会议得到积极的结果。
    在会议的一般性讨论里，尽管美国等西方国家曾经费尽心机地企图规避，但是苏联的对德和约草案实际上是会议讨论的中心。西方国家一次又一次地发言反对迅速缔结和约，但是它们提不出任何令人信服的论据来。西方国家在讨论中被动招架，它们在给它们自己的“一揽子计划”辩护时已经是虚弱无力的了。
    当前，要使得会议进入具体的实际问题的讨论，首先必须突破的一关是，由西方国家自己来解开它们给解决问题打成的死结。本来西方不少报刊早已谈论，西方国家可能被迫在上周的中间便拆散它们的“一揽子计划”。一些英国报纸已经传出英国准备了一项关于西柏林问题的方案。但是，直到上周末，西方国家实际上仍然拒绝讨论具体问题。据伦敦“泰晤士报”23日说，这是由于西方外长们在是否马上解开“一揽子”“包袱”上意见还不一致。有些国家仍然顽固地坚持不愿意马上宣布刚刚出世的“一揽子计划”正式死亡，虽然，这个方案当它刚出生时，就已经是一个死婴了。同时，有些报刊说，这也是由于西方外长在他们提出什么样的柏林问题方案上“意见远没有取得一致”。因此，在周末休会期间，西方四国外长要同各自的政府进行紧急磋商，四国工作小组也在频繁地开会。
    在上周的中间，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊匆匆赶来这里参加会议这一件事，受到了人们的注意。在目前参加会议的六国代表团中，还只有美国一国特地派遣一个军事部长来。这同当前会议要求缓和国际紧张局势的任务，是极不协调的。麦克耳罗伊20日到达日内瓦对新闻记者发表的谈话也是一副“实力政策”的腔调，他强调说，美国军事力量已经采取了“正常的警戒措施”。
    也正在麦克耳罗伊来到日内瓦的前后，美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约时报”、“纽约先驱论坛报”等不断发表社论和文章，叫嚷要从“实力地位”出发，迫使苏联“让步”，要苏联为举行最高级会议“付出代价”，否则美国便不参加最高级会议。在麦克耳罗伊到达这里的第二天，赫脱也突然在外长会议上说什么苏联的态度会导致“非常严重的紧张局势”。
    在美国支持下，西德阿登纳集团更加紧进行猖狂活动，来对会议进行破坏。一直在从事“旅馆外交”的西德外长勃伦塔诺，22日专门对记者发表谈话，公开鼓吹西方必须在苏联“保证”西方在西柏林的占领地位后才能同意举行最高级会议。他并且扬言，如果苏联继续不接受西方“统一德国的计划”，日内瓦会议“可能以失败告终”。勃伦塔诺在讲过这一通话后，周末又返回波恩同阿登纳商谈新的破坏策略。
    22日、23日的英国资产阶级报纸纷纷对这股逆流表示不安。“泰晤士报”公开指出，勃伦塔诺的谈话“没有在事前获得其他西方外长们的赞同”。“每日电讯报”强调第三周必须开始实际问题的认真谈判。“苏格兰人报”的社论说：“寻求共同立场的工作还不曾开始。那里（日内瓦）的某些人士看来根本不希望开始这项工作。”
    英国有些报纸表示了不愿谈判被破坏的愿望，它们之中有一些甚至希望英国外交大臣出来“干预”目前的局势。但是，劳埃德过去两周来的表现怎样呢，他在美国、西德等盟国的高压下不断后退，并且一再在会上给美国帮腔。人们有理由怀疑，劳埃德在新的一周里是否会拿出什么符合英国舆论的主意来。
