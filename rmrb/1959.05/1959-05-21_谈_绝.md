	On "Absolute"
	Yi Heyuan
	When watching opera performances or ball games, there are often situations where the audience will exclaim praise when a character is portrayed vividly or an athlete's performance is particularly outstanding: "This play is absolutely superb!" "This move is an absolute masterstroke!"

	The so-called "absolute" means unique and unmatched, or as the saying goes, "unprecedented and unsurpassed."

	I am not one to nitpick and scrutinize others' cheers to see if there are grammatical errors, but constantly hearing such similar cheers has sparked some associations.

	I love watching Sichuan Opera and can be called a "fanatic." Whenever I see certain famous Sichuan Opera actors perform and act just right, I can't help but applaud and shout "absolute." However, after seeing the same actor perform the same play many times, each performance is better than the last, and the portrayal of the characters is more profound each time. The actors do not become complacent, thinking that their performance has reached its peak, is absolutely perfect, and there is no more room for improvement. Instead, they strive for perfection and go further than ever. It is evident that the word "absolute" is not so appropriate upon careful examination. As the saying goes, "Learning is endless," "You can learn until you're old, but you'll never finish learning." I think art is the same.

	Seeing the same role played by the same actor in the same play many times, I then thought of another question. Watching these actors perform is a great pleasure, there's no doubt about that, but I also think, wouldn't it be great to have more actors of this caliber? It can't always be just a few people. "It's rare to live to seventy," natural law cannot be violated. If their art has no successors, wouldn't it truly be "absolute?"

	However, this is just my unnecessary worry!

	Some time ago, the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe performed in Beijing, and what impressed me the most was that there were more young actors. Although they were young, they performed quite skillfully and beautifully. It is evident that the work of cultivating successors has already or is attracting people's attention, and some have already put it into practice.

	Recently, I watched Peking Opera, Anhui Opera, and Hebei Bangzi, and many outstanding and promising young actors have emerged in these genres. A news item published in the "Wenhui Daily" on May 16th was even more exciting. This news item said that the Shanghai opera circle is vigorously grasping the work of cultivating young actors. The Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera, Huai Opera, Pingtan, and acrobat artists in Shanghai are all under the direct leadership of the Party, taking effective measures to cultivate young actors according to the different situations of each opera genre. Many famous old artists such as Yu Zhenfei and Ding Shi'e have strengthened the teaching and artistic guidance of students. The newspaper's headline in large characters read: "Seniors teach without reservation, and juniors practice diligently. Successors in the Shanghai opera circle are growing."

	This headline is well-written. "Seniors teach without reservation," this would have been very difficult to achieve in the old society. A master teaching a disciple would always hold back a trick or two, fearing that the disciple would surpass them. As a result, many valuable skills followed the old to the mountains and into the coffin, with no successors, truly becoming "absolute." Now, to be able to teach without reservation, fearing that their skills will not be learned by the successors and become "absolute," what a profound ideological change this is! In a word, this is called politics taking the lead. They know that passing on their skills to future generations without reservation is contributing to the socialist cultural and artistic cause, which is an unparalleled honor. Therefore, when they see their disciples learning their skills and even surpassing them, they are not only not jealous but also feel happy and proud, because the achievements of the disciples contain so much of the teacher's hard work!

	With the seniors teaching without reservation and patiently cultivating, and the juniors practicing diligently, successors will surely grow and become stronger. Moreover, it can be predicted that they will surpass their predecessors, making their predecessors rejoice.

	Is this only the case with opera art? To expand on this, look at our industrial, agricultural, cultural, educational, scientific, sports, health, and other fronts. How many gardeners are working diligently to cultivate successors!

	New people are emerging in batches in society, and our socialist construction is leaping forward by leaps and bounds. When we celebrate these achievements, we must first thank the Party's wise leadership and also pay tribute to these diligent gardeners. They have done such meaningful work in cultivating successors!

### 谈“绝”

    谈“绝”
    易和元
    看戏曲表演或球类比赛，往往有这样的情况，当一个角色刻划得维妙维肖，或一个运动员的表演特别出色的时候，观众就会发出这样的称赞：“这个戏真是演绝了！”“这一手真是绝招！”
    所谓“绝”，就是独一无二，无人能及的意思，也就是俗话所说的“前无古人，后无来者”。
    我不是一个爱吹毛求疵的人，对别人的喝采也要去研究一下是否有语病，但是，时常听着这样类似的喝采，倒也引起了一些联想。
    我爱看川剧，称得上一个“迷”字，每当看到某些川剧名演员演的戏，演得恰到好处时，也忍不住鼓掌叫绝。可是，以后又多次看到同一演员演的同一个戏，却一次比一次演得好，对人物的刻划一次比一次深刻，演员没有故步自封，认为自己的戏已经登峰造极，演绝了，没有奔头了，而是精益求精，百尺竿头更进一步。可见这个“绝”字认真研究起来，用得并不那么妥当。常言道“学无止境”，“学到老，学不了”，我想艺术也是这样。
    看同一个角色演的相同的戏多了，于是又想到另外一个问题。看这些演员的戏是一种很大的享受，那是没有话说的，可是心里又想，这样水平的演员多一些不好么，不能老是那么几个人呀。“人生七十古来稀”，自然规律是不能违背的，他们的艺术后继无人，岂不真的“绝”了么？
    然而，这只是我的杞忧而已！
    前些时候，四川省的川剧演出团在北京演出，给我印象最深的是，青年演员增多了，他们虽然年轻，却演得相当熟练和美妙。可见培养接班人的工作，已经或正在引起人们的重视，而且有的已经实地作起来了。
    最近看了京剧、徽剧和河北梆子，这些剧种都涌现了不少出色的有前途的青年演员。5月16日“文汇报”登载的一条消息，更使人兴奋不已。这条消息说，上海戏曲界正在大抓培养青年演员的工作，上海京剧、昆曲、越剧、沪剧、淮剧、评弹和杂技艺人们都在党的直接领导下，根据各剧种不同的情况，对培养青年演员的工作采取了有效措施。许多著名的老艺人如俞振飞、丁是娥等，都加强了培养学员的教学和艺术指导工作。报纸大字标题是：“前辈无保留地教，后学者苦心地练，上海戏曲界接班人在成长”。
    这个标题标得好。“前辈无保留地教”，这在旧社会恐怕是很难做到的，师父教徒弟，总要留那么一手，怕的是徒弟超过了自己。因而很多宝贵的技艺随着人老归山，进了棺材，后继无人，真的“绝”了。而现在能做到无保留的教，生怕自己的本事接班人没有学到，“绝”了，这其中有多么深刻的思想变化啊！一句话，这叫做政治挂了帅。他们知道，把自己的技艺无保留地传给后人，这就是对社会主义的文化艺术事业贡献了力量，是无尚的光荣。因此他们看到徒弟学会了自己的本事，甚至超过了自己，就不但不嫉妒，反而感到欣喜和骄傲，因为在徒弟的成就中，就包含着老师的多少心血啊！
    有了前辈无保留的教，耐心的培养，后学者又苦心地练，接班人一定会成长壮大起来的，而且可以预料，他们会将青出于蓝而胜于蓝，使他们的前辈们欣喜不已。
    这难道只是戏曲艺术是如此么？扩而大之，看一看我们的工业、农业战线，文化教育战线，科学、体育、卫生等各条战线吧，有多少园丁在为培养接班人而辛勤工作着啊！
    社会上新人成批成批地涌现了，我们的社会主义建设事业有如一日千里地飞跃前进，当我们庆贺这些成就的时候，我们首先要感谢党的英明领导，同时也要向这些辛勤的园丁们致敬，他们为培养接班人做了多么有意义的工作！
