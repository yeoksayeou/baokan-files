What to Do About Labor Shortages During the Summer Harvest and Planting Season?
	Licheng Communes Propose Ten Measures to Unleash Labor Potential
	Gucheng Commune in Pixian County Mobilizes the Masses to Launch a High Work Efficiency Campaign

	(Our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd) The people's communes in Licheng County, Shandong, have proposed ten measures to solve the labor shortage problem during the summer harvest and planting season. The county has 350,000 mu of wheat, growing exceptionally well, and harvesting will begin in half a month. Spring-sown crops cover over 800,000 mu, also requiring thinning, weeding, and strengthened management. Historically, these seasonal agricultural tasks of harvesting, planting, and managing are concentrated together. If not properly managed, serious losses can occur. This year, because the wheat crop is so good, harvesting is labor-intensive, and the labor shortage is even more acute. How to solve this difficulty? After calculating their labor force, the communes and production teams proposed ten solutions: (1) Before the summer harvest, launch a high work efficiency campaign at the team level to complete agricultural tasks that can be done before the harvest (such as thinning, weeding, and spraying pesticides on spring-sown crops), striving to complete them ahead of schedule in order to concentrate efforts on the summer harvest. (2) Immediately halt commune-run industries unrelated to the summer harvest and planting. This will free up 20,000 people countywide to be投入投put into agricultural production. (3) Adopt the "three on-the-spot" method (on-the-spot harvesting, on-the-spot threshing, and on-the-spot distribution) for harvesting wheat. This will save about 2.5 workdays per mu compared to transporting it back to the village for threshing and distribution, saving about 500,000 workdays countywide. (4) Adopt three methods for accumulating and transporting base fertilizer for summer-sown crops: accumulate locally, produce locally, and apply locally; transport fertilizer to the fields before harvesting; and launch a campaign for commune members to carry something both uphill and downhill, saving over 80,000 workdays on fertilizer accumulation. (5) For field management of spring-sown crops, implement a system of assigning plots to groups and blocks to households, making responsibilities specific, ensuring everyone is concerned, and improving work efficiency by about 10% based on experience. (6) Prepare materials and tools for harvesting, threshing, transporting, preventing damage, and distribution as early as possible, ensuring everyone has tools to avoid delays. (7) Adopt a long-term plan with short-term arrangements. Production teams have divided the production time around the summer harvest into two periods and made arrangements accordingly. Before the summer harvest, launch a high work efficiency campaign to complete as many agricultural tasks as possible. After the summer harvest begins, have two sets of arrangements for each plan, one for sunny days and one for rainy days, to prevent disruptions to the original plan due to wind and rain. (8) Improve labor quotas, increase work points for major agricultural tasks, and use political persuasion plus rewards to promote labor enthusiasm. (9) Launch competitions between teams, groups, and individuals, organizing four checks and four comparisons at each level from the county to the group (check plans and compare completion, check attendance and compare efficiency, check quantity and compare quality, check organization and compare management), creating a new high tide of production. (10) Cadres take the lead in participating in labor, adhering to eating, living, and working with commune members. Over 250 cadres from county-level departments have been transferred to communes and teams, and county and commune party secretaries are assigned responsibility for specific areas, going deep into the fields.

	After the above ten measures are fully implemented, it is estimated that over 1.7 million workdays can be added countywide. Currently, most of the county's 2,000+ production teams have divided the recent month into two periods and planned according to two sets of plans, implementing the plans at the work group and individual commune member level, launching a competition aimed at high work efficiency. The Hongjialou Production Team of the Dongjiao Commune completed its half-month short-term plan five days ahead of schedule. Commune members in the Ganggou Commune launched a campaign to carry something both ways, and in just a few days, they transported millions of catties of fertilizer to the fields and brought back large quantities of wild feed when returning to the village.

	(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 22nd) Gucheng People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan, focusing on improving labor organization and enhancing technology, mobilized commune members to launch a high work efficiency campaign, overcoming the severe labor shortage during the summer harvest and planting season. From late April to May 20, the commune had harvested over 70% of its spring crops, and the transplanting of early and mid-season rice was also completed seven or eight days earlier than in previous years.

	Gucheng Commune began transplanting early rice on April 18. Because preparations for the summer harvest and the planting of major spring crops were concentrated together, with many tasks and a large workload, the management areas and production teams could not focus on the core tasks. The original plan was to transplant 3,100 mu of early rice by April 29, but only 255 mu had been transplanted by April 24. At this rate, it would take two months to transplant all the early rice (past the start of autumn). The commune party branch immediately convened an emergency mobilization meeting of all commune cadres, emphasizing the need to launch a high work efficiency campaign by improving labor organization and enhancing technology, while also allocating production tasks to each management area to manage themselves, striving to seize the season and complete the tasks on schedule.

	After the production tasks were assigned at each level, the management areas and production teams first calculated the total task and labor force for each month, specifically arranging the progress for each ten-day period and each day based on the specific seasons for harvesting spring crops and planting major spring crops. In terms of labor organization, production teams generally adopted the method of assigning skills to teams, i.e., organizing production based on each person's specialized skills. For example, those who knew how to transplant rice would transplant rice, those suitable for plowing would plow, those with strong physical strength but poor skills would handle transportation, and the elderly and children with weaker physical strength and skills would undertake secondary labor. About 90% of the labor force was consistently engaged in core tasks such as harvesting rapeseed and wheat and transplanting rice, while 10% of the labor force engaged in other tasks. Each management area also organized a shock brigade of 30 to 50 people to reinforce weak links at any time.

	In daily production, Gucheng Commune also adopted the "assigning people to fields, allocating plots and sections" method. Production teams required commune members to freely combine based on their physical strength and skills, giving full play to the role of each commune member. For example, in the past, transplanting rice involved everyone going to the fields regardless of their strength, with a dozen people forming a line, transplanting one row and then the second row, resulting in delays for those who transplanted quickly and wasting labor. After the universal implementation of free combination and "assigning people to fields, allocating plots and sections" in April, the average rice transplanting efficiency of the entire commune increased by more than twofold.

	Gucheng Commune improved labor organization in conjunction with improving technology and promoting advanced experience. To encourage commune members to continuously improve labor efficiency, the commune stipulated that for any type of work, anyone exceeding the quota would not only have the exceeded portion fully calculated into work points, but would also be appropriately rewarded with different materials and honors based on three levels. Management areas also implemented same-day acceptance and same-day awards, promptly publicizing and praising, which greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of commune members. In April, when early rice was first transplanted, the standard quota of 0.25 mu per workday was generally not met. On April 25, seven commune members improved their rice transplanting posture and movements, and their daily rice transplanting exceeded 0.7 mu, with the highest reaching more than one mu. Immediately afterwards, a mass movement of mutual competition and mutual learning of techniques was launched among the management areas, production teams, and individual commune members. By May 9, when the transplanting of early and mid-season rice was completed, the average daily work efficiency of rice transplanting across the commune had broken through the 0.25 mu barrier, reaching over 0.6 mu, increasing work efficiency by more than twofold. In the short space of half a month, more than 400 people across the commune achieved high work efficiency. The harvesting efficiency of various spring crops also increased by more than twofold.

	To consolidate the morale of the masses and promote the in-depth development of the movement, the commune party branch promptly summarized and promoted experience during the high work efficiency movement. After completing the early rice transplanting task in April, the commune summarized the experience of the first battle, selected twelve pacesetters, and promptly put forward the new slogan of "Great Battle in Red May, Strive for Complete Success," further carrying out collective competitions, contests, and skill demonstrations, making the mass movement surge higher and higher.

    夏收夏种劳力不足怎么办
    历城各公社提出十项办法发挥劳动潜力
    郫县古城公社发动群众开展高工效运动
    本报济南22日电　山东历城县各人民公社提出十项办法解决夏收夏种的劳力问题。这个县共有小麦三十五万亩，生长得空前好，再过半月即要开镰收割；春播作物八十多万亩，也需要间苗、锄草加强管理。历年来，收、种、管这几项季节性强烈的农活挤在一起，如果掌握不好，安排不当，就会造成严重的损失。今年因为小麦好，收割费工，劳力更感不足。这个困难怎么解决？各公社和生产队算了劳力账以后，提出了十项解决办法：（1）夏收前以队为单位开展一个高工效突击运动，把可以在开镰前做的农活（如春播作物间苗、锄草、喷撒农药等），争取抢先做好，以便能集中力量搞夏收。（2）立即停止与夏收夏种无关的社办工业，全县可抽出二万人投入农业生产。（3）采取“三就”（就地收割、就地打场、就地分配）的办法收打小麦。这样每亩地的小麦比运回村里打、分，约能省二个半劳动日，全县约能省五十万个劳动日。（4）夏种作物的底肥采取三种办法积运。就地积、就地造，就地施；收割前就把肥运到地头上；开展社员上下坡不空手运动，这样可以节约出八万多个积肥运动的劳动日。（5）春播作物的田间管理，实行组包片、户包块的办法，这样责任具体，人人关心，经验证明可提高工效10％左右。（6）及早作好收、打、运、防、分配等各项物质和工具准备，做到人手一具，以免窝工。（7）长计划短安排。各生产队把夏收前后一个月的生产时间，分为两段作了安排。夏收前是突击开展高工效运动，尽量多赶一些农活；夏收开始以后，一个计划两套安排，晴天有一套安排，雨天也有一套安排，预防因风雨打乱原来计划，造成被动。（8）搞好劳动定额，主要农活增加工分，用政治加奖励的办法促进劳动积极性。（9）开展队与队、组与组、人与人之间的竞赛，从县到小组逐级组织四查四比（查计划比完成、查出勤比效率、查数量比质量、查组织比管理），掀起生产新高潮。（10）干部带头参加劳动，坚持与社员同吃同住同劳动，县直属部门已抽调二百五十多名干部下社下队，县、社党委书记都分片包干，深入田间。
    上述十个办法全部实行之后，全县估计可增加一百七十多万个劳动日。现在全县各公社的二千多个生产队，大部分把最近一个月的时间，分作两段，按两套计划作规划，把计划落实到作业小组和每个社员，展开了以高工效为目标的竞赛。东郊公社的洪家楼生产队，半月的小段计划，已经提前五天完成。港沟公社各生产队的社员，开展不空手运动，利用上地时间，不几天捎到地头上几百万斤肥料，回村时又捎回大批的野生饲料。（胡雷）
    本报成都22日电　四川郫县古城人民公社以改进劳动组织和提高技术为中心，发动社员开展高工效运动，克服了夏收夏种劳动力严重不足的困难。从4月下旬到5月20日为止，全社小春作物已收割70％以上，早稻和中稻栽秧时间也比往年提前了七、八天完成。
    古城公社从4月18日开始栽早稻，因为夏收准备和大春作物栽种挤在一起，头绪多，工作量大，各管理区和生产队抓不住中心，原计划4月29日栽完三千一百亩早稻，到24日才栽下二百五十五亩。按照这样的进度，栽完早稻就需要两个月时间（过了立秋）。公社党总支为此立即召开全社干部紧急动员大会，强调要从改进劳动组织、提高技术着手发动群众开展高工效运动，同时将生产任务分配各管理区自己掌握，力争抢上季节按期完成。
    生产任务层层下达以后，各管理区和生产队首先将每月任务和劳动力算出一笔总账，根据小春收获和大春栽种季节具体安排了每旬、每天的进度。在劳动组织上，各生产队普遍采取了技术归队的办法，即按照每个人的技术专长进行生产。例如会栽秧的去栽秧，适合犁地的去犁地，体力强技术差的人搞运输，体力技术都比较差的老年人和儿童就担负次要的劳动。在日常生产中经常保持90％左右的劳动力从事收割油菜、小麦和栽插水稻等中心工作，10％的劳动力搞其他活路。各管理区并分别组织一支三十人到五十人的突击队随时突击薄弱环节。
    在日常生产中，古城公社还采取了“人田对号，分片分段”的办法。生产队要求社员根据自己体力和技术强弱自由组合，充分发挥每个社员的作用。例如过去栽秧不管劳力强弱一齐下田，十几个人拉成一根线，栽完一行再栽第二行，结果插秧快的人窝工，劳动力浪费很大。4月份各管理区普遍实行自由组合，分片分段“人田对号”以后，全社平均栽秧工效就提高了一倍以上。
    古城公社改进劳动组织是和改进技术、推广先进经验同时并行的。为了鼓励社员不断提高劳动效率，公社规定无论任何工种，凡是超过定额者，超过部分除全部计算工分外，并分成三个等级适当给以不同的物资奖励和荣誉奖励。各管理区并实行当天验收，当天发奖，及时宣传表扬，这种办法大大激发了社员的生产积极性。4月份最初栽早稻时，每个工定额日插二分五厘田普遍达不到，4月25日全社有七个社员改进了栽秧姿势和动作，每天插秧就超过七分田以上，最高达到一亩多。紧接着各管理区、生产队和社员个人之间掀起了互相竞赛，互相学习技术的群众运动，到5月9日早中稻栽完为止，全社插秧的日平均工效就突破二分五厘田，达到六分田以上，提高工效一倍多。在短短的半个月中，全社创造高工效的共有四百多人。各种小春作物收割工效也提高了一倍以上。
    公社党总支为了巩固群众情绪，推动运动的深入发展，在高工效运动中，及时总结经验，及时推广。4月份完成了早稻栽插任务后，公社总结了第一个战役的经验，评出十二名标兵，并及时提出“大战红五月，力争满堂红”的新口号，进一步开展集体竞赛，打擂比武，使群众运动一浪高过一浪。（吕希林）
