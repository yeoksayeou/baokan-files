Indigenous Machinery Frees Over 90% of Workers from Heavy Labor
Xiangshan Iron Mine More Than Doubles Mining Efficiency
Representatives from Fifteen Provinces (Autonomous Regions) and Municipalities Express Universal Satisfaction After Visiting

(Our newspaper, Yantai, 17th) The Yantai Xiangshan Iron Mine in Shandong Province has greatly increased labor productivity by vigorously promoting indigenous mechanization.

To better fulfill its role as the "logistics department" of the steel front, the Yantai Xiangshan Iron Mine, in response to the backward state of manual labor, mobilized the masses to engage in a large-scale technical innovation campaign. Currently, the entire mine has basically achieved indigenous mechanization of drilling, wooden rail ore car transportation, and winch hoisting, freeing over 90% of workers from heavy manual labor. Mining efficiency has more than doubled, stripping and transportation efficiency has more than doubled, and over 800 workers have been freed to support agricultural production.

The mine's planned output for this year is approximately double the actual output of last year, but production conditions are not as good as last year: the mine pits are getting deeper and deeper, increasing the difficulty of stripping and mining, and also causing inconvenience for hoisting and transportation. Therefore, some cadres and masses lacked confidence in completing the plan. Based on this ideological situation, the mine's Party committee organized the masses to launch a "speaking out and airing views" debate. Through the debate, the workers clarified the policy of self-reliance, mustered the courage to overcome difficulties, and strengthened their confidence in completing the task. On this basis, the mine's Party committee mobilized the masses to engage in a large-scale technical innovation campaign. Mine leaders first organized the first working area to conduct experiments, quickly laying two wooden tracks and developing wooden mine cars, using a rope-pulling method of "using the heavy to pull the light," utilizing the natural slope to automatically slide ore-filled mine cars along the wooden tracks to the mine yard, while simultaneously bringing back the emptied mine cars. This not only reduced labor intensity but also greatly improved work efficiency. The mine's Party committee seized on this example and convened an on-site meeting. A breakthrough in one area led to comprehensive progress. As the first working area took one step, all working areas and sections caught up. The slogan "Everyone a Skilled Craftsman" quickly resounded throughout every corner of the mine. Carpenter Zheng Wenqi, after several days of hard work, successfully trial-produced and modified four types of tools, including self-dumping mine cars and foot-operated universal drilling machines. When miners saw that the rock was hard and drilling progress was slow, they manufactured a tracked bearing drilling machine specifically for hard rock. Section Chief Dong Shiyuan of the third working section discovered that there were not enough steel wire springs for the drilling machines, so he studied using bamboo strips as a substitute; when there was insufficient iron material for making wooden track switches, the workers solved the problem by using wood with triangular iron.

Due to the workers greatly demonstrating the spirit of hard work and ingenuity, the entire mine currently has: eighty various wooden drilling machines, seventy-seven various wooden mine cars, two wooden pot-camel winches, fifty wooden tracks with a total length of more than 4,200 meters, and thirty aerial cableways with a total length of more than 1,390 meters. This has significantly improved mining efficiency. Comparing the average daily output in the first quarter with the average daily output in April, it jumped from 99.75 tons to 214.34 tons. Due to the increase in work efficiency and the reduction in personnel, mining costs have also decreased by more than 50%.

To promote the advanced experience of the Xiangshan Iron Mine, Shandong Province convened a mining technology exchange experience meeting in Yantai in late April. In addition to the heads of the provincial and special area (city) metallurgical bureaus and various mines, representatives from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and fifteen provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities, including Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Wuhan, also participated. The participants expressed universal satisfaction with the significant achievements made by the Xiangshan Iron Mine in vigorously promoting indigenous mechanization.

    土机械使90％以上工人摆脱笨重劳动
    祥山铁矿采矿效率提高一倍多
    十五个省（区）市的代表参观以后普遍感到满意
    本报烟台17日电　山东省烟台祥山铁矿大搞土机械化生产，劳动生产率大大提高。
    烟台市祥山铁矿为了更好地发挥钢铁战线“后勤部”的作用，针对手工操作的落后状况，发动群众大闹技术革新，目前全矿已经基本上实现凿岩土机械化，运输木轨矿车化，提升卷扬化，使90％以上的工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，采矿效率提高一倍多，剥离和运输效率提高两倍多，并节余八百多人支援农业生产。
    这个矿今年的计划产量约比去年实际产量增加一倍，可是生产条件却不如去年：矿坑越来越深，给剥离、采矿增加了困难，也给提升、运输带来了不便。因此，部分干部和群众对完成计划缺乏信心。矿党委根据这种思想情况，组织群众展开了鸣放辩论。通过鸣放辩论，使职工明确了自力更生的方针，鼓起了克服困难的勇气和完成任务的信心。在这个基础上，矿党委发动群众大闹技术革新。矿的领导干部首先组织第一工区进行试验，很快地铺起两条木轨道，搞起木矿车，用以重带轻的绳索牵引法，利用自然坡度，把装有矿石的矿车顺着木轨道自动滑向矿场，同时又把已卸下矿石的矿车带回来。这样，既减轻了劳动强度，又大大提高了工效。矿党委抓住这一事例，召开了现场会议。一点突破，全面开花。第一工区才迈了一步，各工区、工段都赶上来了。“人人当巧匠”的口号，迅速响遍了矿山的每个角落。木工郑文起经过几天苦钻，试制和改造成功了自倒矿车和脚踏万能打眼机等四种工具。矿工们看到岩石硬，打眼进度慢，便制造了一种专门对付坚硬岩石的有轨轴承打眼机。第三工段长董士元发现打眼机的钢丝弹簧不够用，便研究用竹板代替；做木轨道岔的铁料不足，工人就用木材加三角铁的办法解决。
    由于职工大大发挥了苦干巧干的精神，目前，全矿土机械已有：各种木制打眼机八十台，各种木制矿车七十七部，木制锅驼卷扬机二台，木轨道五十条总长四千二百多公尺，架空索道三十条，总长一千三百九十多公尺。这样就使采矿效率显著提高，以第一季度的平均日产量与4月份的平均日产量比较，由九十九点七五吨跃增到二百一十四点三四吨。由于工效提高，人员减少，采矿成本也降低了50％以上。
    为了推广祥山铁矿的先进经验，山东省于4月下旬在烟台召开了矿山技术交流经验会议，除省和各专区（市）冶金局以及各矿的负责人参加外，冶金工业部以及辽宁、内蒙古、武汉等十五个省（自治区）、市，也派代表参加。与会者对祥山铁矿大搞土机械化获得的显著成果，普遍感到满意。
