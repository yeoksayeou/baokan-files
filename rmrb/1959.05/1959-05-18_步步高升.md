Rising Step by Step

    The successful creation of an automatic steel diverting rudder, an automatic slag skimmer, and an automatic crane transmission by the workers of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, which has unleashed even greater power in three-tap steel production, is a major event.

    Three-tap steel production is an innovation in China's steel production, an innovation that has greatly accelerated the speed of steel production. Now, with the emergence of these three automated devices, the series of production techniques for three-tap steel production are more complete, allowing this new method of rapid steel tapping to be firmly established on a solid and reliable foundation.

  The emergence of a new production method is generally not perfect at the beginning; especially because the related equipment, tools, and processes cannot immediately adapt to the changes brought about by this new production method, resulting in temporary imbalances in production. This is not surprising. Breaking the old balance, creating a new imbalance, and then establishing a new balance is an inevitable law in production transformation. As long as we grasp this law, focus on the imbalances, work diligently, and create boldly, we will definitely find solutions to gradually complete the new production method, establish a new balance, and improve production levels step by step. The situation of three-tap steel production at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company is a vivid illustration of this law.

    步步高升
    太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂职工成功地创造了自动分钢舵、自动扒渣机、天车自动变速机，使三槽出钢发挥出更大的威力，这是一件大事。
    三槽出钢是我国钢铁生产上的一项创举，这项创举曾经使钢的生产速度大大加快。现在，又有了三项自动化设备的出现，这就使三槽出钢的一系列生产技术更加完备，可以使三槽出钢这一新的快速出钢方法，稳固在一个坚实可靠的基础上。
  一个新的生产方法出现，开始总不会是那么完美无缺的；特别是由于有关的设备、工具、工序等，不能立即适应这种新的生产方法的改变，生产上就会出现一时不平衡的现象。这是不足为奇的。打破旧的平衡，出现新的不平衡，再建立新的平衡，这是生产变革中的必然规律。只要掌握这一规律，从不平衡处着眼，刻苦钻研，大胆创造，就一定能寻到解决的办法，使新的生产方法达到逐步完整，使新的平衡建立起来，使生产水平步步提高。太原钢铁公司三槽出钢的情况，正是这个规律的最生动的说明。
