Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th: The National Research and Appraisal Conference on Water Conservancy Construction Tools and Land Leveling Machinery was held in Hefei, Anhui Province, in early May. Eighty-four representatives from twenty-one provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College and the East China Institute of Water Conservancy, attended the conference. Relevant departments of the Ministry of Agriculture also sent personnel to participate.

During the conference, seventy-seven advanced tools and models for water conservancy construction and land leveling, created by Guangdong, Henan, Anhui, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities, were exhibited. Representatives from many provinces and regions introduced their experiences in improving these tools. The conference adopted a combination of on-site observation, group discussion, and centralized appraisal to conduct preliminary research and appraisal of the exhibited tools and models. A total of fourteen types of earth transportation tools, including slope climbing transportation, flat ground transportation, vertical transportation, and aerial transportation, were selected, as well as five types of compacting, ridge building, and leveling tools. The conference believed that these tools, along with the rope traction machine comprehensively utilized by Liaoning Province, the power soil splitting machine from Heilongjiang Province, the tractor-drawn train and frozen soil cutting blade from Jilin Province, the power-driven double-wheeled cart for dam construction and the winch from Hebei Province, the slurry mixer, drilling machine, and cement ball making machine from Shaanxi Province, and the water conservancy grinding machine from Shanxi Province, are all relatively good advanced tools and can be vigorously promoted and used in various regions based on their regional characteristics and different engineering construction conditions.

The conference pointed out that land leveling is an important measure for implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and must be given the same importance as water conservancy work. Various regions should continue to summarize the experiences of the masses and conduct careful research in order to create more and better machinery to promote land leveling work.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st: The recent on-site conference on deep-well water pumps and wind-powered engines held in Shenyang, attended by ten provinces (regions), summarized and exchanged the achievements and experiences of various provinces (regions) in researching and utilizing deep-well water pumps and wind-powered engines. Technical appraisals were conducted on eleven different models of windmills and two deep-well water pumps sent by Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, and other provinces, and it was requested that all provinces vigorously develop research and utilization of wind power and deep-well water pumps to play a greater role in solving the shortage of power and promoting various production and construction projects.

The conference believed that in recent years, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the research and utilization of deep-well water pumps and wind-powered engines in various provinces (regions) has made great progress and achieved certain successes. Most of the windmills and water pumps participating in the on-site competition this time were successful and had different characteristics. The Jiangsu Province's Five? Windmill and Double Awning Windmill are simple in structure, low in cost, and entirely made of wood, making them easy to manufacture and use, and they are also highly efficient, with each unit capable of irrigating thirty-five mu of land. The "Five-Five" type windmill successfully trial-produced by the Baichengzi Special Zone in Jilin Province can not only lift water but also drive various operating machines. The windmill-driven pulverizer successfully trial-produced by the Guantun Team of the Jiuzhai People's Commune in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, can rotate even in a level four wind, and its flour milling efficiency is more than ten times higher than that of donkey-drawn mills. This team uses one such windmill to grind flour, replacing the workload of fourteen animal-drawn mills. The flour milled can supply the needs of all fourteen collective canteens and more than four thousand people in the team, and it also saves twenty-six human laborers and twenty-eight animal laborers, which can be added to other production posts. The small high-speed windmill manufactured by the Liaoning Provincial Institute of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, which can drive both operating machines and generate electricity, has aroused great interest among representatives from various provinces.

The wooden water pump created by the Taian Town People's Commune in Taian County, Liaoning Province, also participated in this on-site performance and received high praise from representatives of various provinces. This water pump, except for the impeller and shaft, is entirely made of wood, with each unit costing only 136 yuan. Test results show that this wooden water pump, driven by a 15-horsepower power machine, can rotate 1,200 to 1,400 revolutions per minute. Operating for ten hours a day, it can lift 1,400 tons of water at a head (i.e., water lifting height) of seven to eight meters, which can irrigate more than twenty-five mu of land. Representatives from various regions attached great importance to the Shenyang Water Pump Factory's introduction of using willow pipes to replace iron water pump pipes, unanimously believing that this method is of great research and utilization value under the current shortage of steel. In addition, the deep-well water pump created by Ma Changxin, a veteran worker in Anshan City, also has a head of 30 meters, providing a powerful weapon for extracting groundwater in areas with low groundwater levels.

The conference pointed out that China's industrial and agricultural production is developing rapidly. Vigorously researching and utilizing deep-well water pumps and fully extracting groundwater are important measures to ensure increased agricultural production. Under the current situation where mechanical power, fuel, and electricity are still in short supply in our country, the widespread use of wind power to increase power resources is of great significance. The conference believed that wind energy is inexhaustible and should be vigorously researched and utilized.

More than ninety representatives from ten provinces (regions), including Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and relevant departments, participated in this conference.

    农业部召开两个现场会议
    推广先进水利工具  利用风力增加动力
    新华社合肥20日电　全国水利施工工具及土地平整机具研究鉴定会议，于本月上旬在安徽省合肥市举行。出席会议的有二十一个省、市、自治区和北京农业机械化学院、华东水利学院等单位的八十四位代表，农业部有关部门也派人参加了会议。
    会议期间展出了广东、河南、安徽、上海等省、市创造的七十七种水利施工和平整土地的先进工具和模型，许多省区代表在会上介绍了改良这两项工具的经验。会议采取现场观测，分组讨论和集中鉴定相结合的方式，对展出的工具和模型，作了初步研究鉴定，共计选出爬坡运输、平地运输、垂直运输和空中运输等运土工具十四种；夯压、筑畦和平整工具五种。会议认为，这些工具和辽宁省介绍的绳索牵引机综合利用，黑龙江省的动力劈土机，吉林省的拖拉机牵引列车和开挖冻土的拉刀，河北省的动力带动双轮车上坝和卷扬机，陕西省的拌浆机、打眼机和水泥制球机，山西省的水利磨碎机等，都是比较好的先进工具，各地可根据地区特点和工程施工的不同条件大力推广使用。
    会议指出：土地平整工作是贯彻农业“八字宪法”的一项重要措施，必须与水利工作同等重视，各地应当继续抓紧总结群众经验，认真研究，以便创造更多、更好的机具，使土地平整工作开展起来。
    新华社沈阳21日电　最近在沈阳举行的十省（区）深井水泵和风力发动机现场会议，总结和交流了各省（区）研究利用深井水泵和风力发动机的成就和经验，并对江苏、吉林、辽宁等省选送的十一台不同型号的风车和两台深井水泵，分别进行了技术鉴定，要求各省大力开展风动力和深井水泵的研究利用工作，为解决动力不足和推动各项生产建设发挥更大的作用。
    会议认为：几年来，随着工农业生产大跃进，各省（区）深井水泵和风力发动机的研究利用工作，已有很大进展，并取得了一定成就。这次参加现场比赛的风车和水泵，大部分是成功的，并且都具有不同的特点。江苏省的五?风车和双篷风车，构造简单，成本低廉，机体全为木质结构，容易制造使用，效率也较高，每台可灌田三十五亩。吉林省白城子专区试制成功的“五五”型风车，不但能提水，同时又能带动各种作业机具。辽宁省盖平县九寨人民公社官屯小队试制成功的风车带动粉碎机，四级风就可以转动，磨面的效率比驴拉磨提高十倍以上。这个队使用一台这种风车磨面，代替了十四台畜拉磨的作业量，所磨的面能供应全队十四个集体食堂、四千多人的需要，并且还节省出二十六个人力和二十八个畜力增加到其它生产岗位上去。辽宁省机电研究所制造的小高速风车，既能带动作业机具，又能发电，引起了各省代表的很大兴趣。
    辽宁省台安县台安镇人民公社创制的木制水泵，也参加了这次现场表演，受到了各省代表的好评。这台水泵除叶轮和轴以外，全部是用木料作成，每台成本只一百三十六元。试验的结果表明，这种木制水泵用十五马力的动力机带动，每分钟能转一千二百到一千四百转，每天操作十小时，在七至八公尺的扬程（即提水高度）下，可提水一千四百吨，能浇地二十五亩以上。各地代表对沈阳水泵厂介绍的利用柳条管代替铁制水泵管非常重视，一致认为在目前钢铁不足的情况下，这个办法大有研究利用的价值。此外，鞍山市老工人马长新创制的深井水泵，扬程也达三十公尺，为地下水位低的地区提取地下水提供了有力的武器。
    会议指出：我国工农业生产正在飞跃发展，大力研究和利用深井水泵，充分提取地下水，是保证农业增产的重要措施，在我国机械动力、燃料和电力目前还供应不足的情况下，广泛利用风动力增加动力资源，就有重要的意义。会议认为，风的能源取之不尽，用之不竭，应该大力研究利用。
    参加这次会议的有河北、山西、江苏、陕西、湖北、山东、内蒙古、吉林和黑龙江等十个省（区）和有关部门的代表共九十多人。
