Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 28th. On the eve of Children's Day, the Tianjin Juvenile and Children's Fine Arts Publishing House meticulously printed twenty kinds of propaganda posters and ten kinds of children's picture books as holiday gifts for the children. Among these propaganda posters are collaborative works by famous cartoonists from China and the Soviet Union. One is "Sanmao and Alyosha" by Soviet cartoonist Yefimov and Chinese cartoonist Zhang Leping. The two artists drew the Chinese "Sanmao" and the Soviet "Alyosha" that they were familiar with, exchanging red scarves with each other, expressing the profound friendship between Chinese and Soviet children. The poet Yuan Ying wrote a long poem for this painting, one section of which reads: "The warm east wind blows, the clear spring rain sprinkles; the Sino-Soviet friendship is planted, sprouting new buds every year; please look at the two seedlings, Sanmao and Alyosha. It is expected that the two have same mind, not a bit off; both want to never leave, both want to grow up quickly; riding the thousand-mile horse together, travel all over the world." Another painting, "Natasha and Zhang Xiaolan," is from the hand of the famous Soviet cartoonist Litvinenko, with two little girls, Natasha and Zhang Xiaolan, embracing each other affectionately. The writer Fang Ji also wrote a poem for this painting: "Two little girls, like two flowers; don't look at their young age, their ambitions are great; transform the old society, build a new country; we hold hands, and we are not afraid of anyone!"
