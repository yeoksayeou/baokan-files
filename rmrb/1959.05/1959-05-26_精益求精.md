Striving for Perfection
          Huang Zhi
    After the people's communes further implement unified leadership, decentralized management, and decentralized accounting, and further implement the principle of "to each according to his work, more work, more pay," they have created very good conditions for rapidly improving and enhancing the operation and management of the communes and for conducting economic work more meticulously, thereby developing the commune economy more quickly. Now, the various production responsibility systems widely established in people's communes in various places, such as "three guarantees and one reward," and "several quotas to the field," are its specific manifestations. Due to the establishment of various production responsibility systems, the phenomenon of temporary work assignments every day has been reduced in many places, the situation of idling has changed, and each commune member can understand the production requirements and their specific tasks, thereby exerting a high degree of production initiative and responsibility. The Xibu Production Team of the Nankouqian People's Commune in Qingyuan County, Liaoning, published in this newspaper today is a good example. This team implemented the "contracted work piecework card system" on the basis of the "small segment plan." The card specifically stipulates what farm work each commune member does in a certain "small segment," where the production location is, how much quantity to do, what quality to achieve, and how many work points of remuneration can be obtained after completion according to regulations. This kind of meticulous and specific organizational work and management work truly makes everyone's responsibilities clear, everyone is in their proper place, and everyone can give full play to their strengths.
    What Xibu Team is worthy of people's learning also lies in the pragmatic and meticulous working style and the spirit of striving for perfection of the team's cadres. Some places consider it implemented after the "small segment production plan" is formulated, but the comrades of the Xibu Team further implement the small segment operation to each commune member; some places consider it implemented after proposing the quantity, quality, and completion date of production to the commune members, but the comrades of the Xibu Team further stipulate the remuneration that the commune members should receive for this labor, so that the commune members have a clear idea of both production and income; some places consider it completed the task after organizing forces to determine the operation plan, but the Xibu Team also seriously summarizes in order to continuously improve the work. In this way, they put the production responsibility system on a more practical and reliable basis, and on the basis of the conscious and voluntary participation of all commune members. This pragmatic and meticulous working style and the spirit of striving for perfection are in line with the law that economic work becomes more and more meticulous. Therefore, greatly advocating and promoting this spirit will surely make our production better.
    Some people say that the commune members' awareness is already very high, and they do whatever the cadres tell them to do. The production responsibility system should not be formulated too meticulously and specifically, as it will limit the commune members' initiative and creativity. This statement is only half right. It is right to say that the commune members' awareness has indeed greatly improved compared to the past. However, it is not right to say that because the commune members' awareness is high, there is no need to establish production order and system. Nothing can be accomplished without norms and standards. Our production is collective production, and collective production cannot do without order and system, and without scientific organization. The responsibility system promoted in various places now is not something that someone casually formulates and imposes on the masses, but the needs of production development and the summary of the masses' production practices. Therefore, its promotion will not only hinder but also facilitate the masses' production initiative and creativity.
    This year's grain production task is huge. Now, many areas are about to harvest summer crops, and more places are continuing spring sowing and carrying out field management of autumn crops. Ensuring that the summer harvest is carried out in an orderly manner and striving for a great harvest largely depends on whether various production responsibility systems have been conscientiously established and improved while raising the political awareness of the vast number of commune members, and whether the level of labor management has been raised to a new height.

    人民公社进一步贯彻统一领导，分级管理，分级核算以后，进一步贯彻按劳付酬多劳多得的原则以后，已经为迅速地改进和提高公社的经营管理和更加细致地进行经济工作，从而更快地发展公社经济创造了很好的条件。现在，各地人民公社广泛建立起来的各种生产责任制，诸如三包一奖、几定几到田等等，就是它的具体表现。由于各种生产责任制的确立，许多地方每天临时派工的现象减少了，窝工的状况改变了，每个社员都能弄清楚生产要求和自己的具体任务，从而发挥高度的生产主动性和负责精神。今天本报发表的辽宁清原县南口前人民公社西卜生产小队就是一个很好的例子。这个队在“小段计划”基础上推行了“包工计件卡片制”。卡片上具体地规定出每个社员在某一个“小段”里净作什么农活，生产地点在哪里，数量做多少，做到什么质量，以及按规定完成后可以得多少工分报酬等。这种细致具体的组织工作、管理工作，真正做到了使人人责任分明，各得其所，各舒所长。
    西卜小队值得人们学习之处，还在于这个小队干部们的踏实细致的工作作风和精益求精的工作精神。有些地方订立“小段生产计划”以后就算落实了，西卜小队的同志们却又进一步把小段作业落实到每个社员身上；有些地方对社员提出生产的数量、质量、完成日期就算落实了，西卜小队的同志们更规定出社员从事这次劳动的应得报酬，使社员对生产和收入都心中有底；有些地方组织力量定了作业计划就算完成任务了，西卜小队还要认真地进行总结，以便不断改进工作。这样，他们就把生产责任制放在一个更加切实可靠的基础之上，放在全体社员自觉自愿的基础之上了，这种踏实细致的工作作风和精益求精的工作精神，是符合经济工作越作越细致的规律的，因此，大大提倡和发扬这种精神，一定会使我们的生产搞得更好。
    有人说，社员觉悟已经很高，干部叫做什么就做什么，生产责任制不应该订得太细太具体，那样会限制社员的主动性和创造性。这话只说对了一小半。社员的觉悟比过去的确大大提高了，这样说是对的。但是因为社员觉悟高就不需要建立生产秩序和制度的说法，就不对了。不以规矩不能成方圆，我们的生产是集体生产，而集体生产没有秩序和制度，没有科学的组织性是不行的。现在各地推行的责任制度，并不是谁随便订出来强加在群众身上的，而是生产发展的需要和群众生产实践的总结，因此它的推广不仅不会妨碍反而更有利于群众的生产主动性创造性的发挥。
    今年粮食生产任务是巨大的。现在，许多地区就要夏收，更多的地方在继续春播和进行秋季作物的田间管理。保证夏收井井有条地进行，努力争取大获丰收，在很大程度上决定于提高广大社员政治觉悟的同时是否认真建立和健全了各种生产责任制度，把劳动管理水平提到一个新的高度。
