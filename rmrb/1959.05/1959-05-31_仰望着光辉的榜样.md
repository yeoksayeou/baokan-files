    Those with revolutionary spirit who are disabled or paralyzed always take Paul Kochakin as a model to learn from. Wu Yun-duo is like this, and so is Wang Meng-yun, the author of "Song from the Sickbed." Subsequent learners not only learn from Paul but also from many living heroes. Recently, in the film "Forever Loyal to the Party," many of the strongest communists have engaged in this kind of learning. They learn, always taking everything advanced as their own flesh and blood, putting it into action, and never stopping at the stage of admiration.
  University students love to read Soviet works such as "Three People in Grey Overcoats" and "The University Student" because they discover the shadow of their own progress in those works. "The Song of Youth" attracts young people precisely because Lin Daojing's transformation process has some similarities to the situation of some young people.
    Special thanks should be given to our writers, playwrights, and poets, who recently presented the artistic image of "Xiang Xiu-li" to the readers. The spiritual inspiration she gives is enormous. Xiang Xiu-li once yearned for brilliant examples such as Zoya and Liu Hulan; and she herself has now become one of these brilliant examples. After reading the deeds of some revolutionary martyrs, Martyr An Yemin once excitedly said: They educated the living until generations to come. And he himself has now become such an educator. Xu Xuehui, who is now being eagerly studied by young people all over the country, said: "It is the light of the Party, it is the images of heroes such as Zhao Yiman and Liu Hulan that illuminated my heart." The youth of our era are always eager to learn from the model figures of the past and present. This is a good trend. Some places have also organized the study of the characters in "Old Communist Youth League Member" written by Comrade Chang Fa. As mentioned above, Communist Youth League members have a particularly close feeling when learning from old Communist Youth League members. The spirit of the older generation of League members, their loyalty to the Party, their enthusiasm for work, their hard study, etc., always awakens upward emotions in their hearts.
    The people of our era, with the most reverent hearts and the most active actions, look up to and learn from various brilliant examples; and the brilliant examples, in our era, can play a greater role than in any previous era.

    仰望着光辉的榜样
    田奇
    具有革命精神的残废者与瘫痪者，总是把保尔·柯察金，作为自己学习的榜样。吴运铎是如此，“病床上的歌”的作者王孟筠也是如此。随后的学习者，不但学保尔，而且学习很多活着的英雄。最近，影片“永远忠于党”里边，有着不少共产主义的最坚强的人，都进行了这种学习。他们学习，总是将一切先进的东西，作为自己的血肉，付诸于行动。而绝不是停留在赞美的阶段上。
  大学生爱读苏联的“三个穿灰大衣的人”、“大学生”等作品，因为从那些作品里，发现了自己前进中的影子。“青春之歌”所以吸引了青年，正是林道静的改造过程，与一些青年的状况，有某些近似。
    应该特别感谢我们的作家、剧作家、诗人，最近又将“向秀丽”的艺术形象送给读者，她给人的精神鼓舞是巨大的。向秀丽曾经渴慕卓娅、刘胡兰这些光辉的榜样；而她自己现在也成了这种光辉的榜样之一；安业民烈士在读了一些革命先烈的事迹以后，曾经激动地说：他们教育了活着的人一直到子孙万代。而他自己现在又成了这样的教育者；现在被全国青年争相学习的徐学惠说：“是党的光辉，是赵一曼、刘胡兰等英雄人物的形象，照亮了我的心。”我们这个时代的青年，总是渴望着向前代和当代的模范人物学习，这是好风气。有的地方还组织了对常发同志写的“老共青团员”中的人物的学习。正像上面所说，共青团员学习老共青团员，有着特别亲切的情感，老一代的团员，他们忠于党，热心工作，刻苦学习等等精神，总是时刻在心上唤起向上的感情。
    我们时代的人，用最崇敬的心情，最积极的行动来仰望与学习各个光辉的榜样；而光辉的榜样，在我们这个时代，又比以往任何时代，能发挥更大的作用。
