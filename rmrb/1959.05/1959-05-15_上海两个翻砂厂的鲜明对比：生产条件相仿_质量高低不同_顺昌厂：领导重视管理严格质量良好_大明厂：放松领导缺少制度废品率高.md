A Sharp Contrast Between Two Shanghai Foundries:
	Similar Production Conditions, Different Quality Levels
	Shunchang Factory: Leaders Value, Management Strict, Quality Good
	Daming Factory: Relaxed Leadership, Lack of Systems, High Rejection Rate

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the *Liberation Daily*, the Shanghai Shunchang Foundry and the Daming Foundry have similar production conditions, but their rejection rates differ greatly. The reason lies in the different degrees to which these two factories value quality and their different attitudes towards the use of local iron.

The technical equipment conditions and production scale of Shunchang and Daming factories are roughly the same. Their products are basically general-purpose machinery within the six major equipment tasks, and the composition of the local iron and local coke used in production is also similar. However, since December of last year, the rejection rate of the Daming Factory has been very high. The average monthly rejection rate in January, February, and March was over 10%, with the highest reaching over 20%; while the quality of the Shunchang Factory has been stable, with an average rejection rate of only 2% in the first quarter, and further dropping to 0.7% in the first half of April.

At the end of last year, the rejection rate of the Shunchang Factory also once reached over 20%. After analyzing the reasons, the leading cadres believed that the issue of quality had not yet received sufficient attention from the cadres and the masses. Therefore, they promptly strengthened education and launched a mass movement to improve quality, ensuring that everyone cared about quality. At the same time, they also took a series of technical and organizational measures to guarantee and improve quality. For example, a dedicated person responsibility system was established in key production departments, technical inspection work was strengthened, production team leaders were responsible for checking the product quality of the groups, and workshop directors were responsible for checking the first batch of production and main links such as modeling, technology, casting, and batching. When a large batch of local iron came in, it was sent to the Casting and Forging Company for testing in a timely manner to correctly grasp its composition. Great importance was also attached to production preparation work. For castings with large batches and high technical requirements or particularly large castings, once the drawings arrived, a technical team composed of the workshop director and production team leader would study them in detail, and propose requirements to the customer for the production of sand casting wooden molds. When the customer sent the wooden molds, the technical team would study and formulate process operating rules, and the production team leader would explain them in detail to the operators, so that everyone could closely grasp the requirements of the process operation. In this way, although Shunchang Factory used a large amount of local iron, its quality was still able to improve month by month.

However, the situation at the Daming Factory was different. As early as the end of last year, with the help of the Casting and Forging Company, the factory installed a hot air device on the furnace to remove sulfur from the local iron. Because most of the factory's iron at that time was still good pig iron, the leaders did not pay attention to this test work, and procrastinated repeatedly, until the Communist Youth League group in the factory carried out a surprise attack in late March to initially test it successfully. Therefore, production was very passive. In the past few months, although the leading cadres have begun to pay attention to the situation of continuously increasing rejection rates, they have not taken effective technical and organizational measures, and have not established the necessary production responsibility system. When feeding materials, good and bad materials are not strictly distinguished, and the materials charged into the furnace are not weighed, relying entirely on visual estimation. The quality analysis system has not been established, so quality cannot be improved for a long time.

    上海两个翻砂厂的鲜明对比：
    生产条件相仿  质量高低不同
    顺昌厂：领导重视管理严格质量良好
    大明厂：放松领导缺少制度废品率高
    本报讯　据解放日报消息：上海顺昌翻砂厂和大明翻砂厂，生产条件相仿，而废品率却高低悬殊。原因就在于这两个厂对质量重视的程度不同，对使用土铁的态度不同。
    顺昌与大明两厂的技术设备条件与生产规模大致相仿，产品基本上都是六大设备任务中的通用性机械，生产所用的土铁土焦成份也差不多。可是大明厂从去年12月份以来，废品率一直很高，1、2、3月份每月的平均废品率，都在百分之十几，最高的达到20％以上；而顺昌厂的质量情况却一直很稳定，一季度平均废品率只有2％，4月上半月下降至0.7％。
    顺昌厂去年年底废品率也曾一度达到过20％以上，领导干部分析原因，认为主要是质量问题还没有引起干部和群众的足够重视，于是便及时加强教育，发动群众掀起一个提高质量的群众运动，做到人人关心质量。同时，他们还采取了一系列的技术和组织措施，来保证和提高质量。如在生产的关键部门建立专人负责制，加强技术检查工作，生产组长负责检查小组的产品质量，车间主任负责检查首批制作和造型、工艺、浇铸、配料等主要环节。进来批量较大的土铁，及时送请铸锻公司化验，以便正确掌握它的成份。对生产准备工作也很重视，凡是批量较大、技术要求较高的铸件或特别大的铸件，图纸一到，先由车间主任和生产组长组成的技术小组详细研究，向客户提出制作翻砂木模的要求，客户将木模送到，便由技术小组研究制订工艺操作规则，由生产组长向操作工人详细交代，使大家能够紧紧掌握工艺操作的要求。这样，顺昌厂虽使用了大量土铁，质量仍能逐月提高。
    可是大明厂的情况就不然。这个厂早在去年底，就在铸锻公司的帮助下，在炉上装热风装置来去除土铁中的硫。因为当时厂内所用的大部分还是好生铁，领导对这项试验工作一直不重视，一拖再拖，直到3月下旬才在厂内共青团小组的突击下初步试验成功。因此生产就很被动。这几个月来，领导干部对废品率不断提高的情况，虽然已经开始重视，但是却没有采取有力的技术和组织措施，没有建立必要的生产责任制度。下料时，对好坏料不作严格区别，所投炉料也都不过磅，全凭眼力估计，质量分析制度也没有建立，因而质量长期不能提高。
