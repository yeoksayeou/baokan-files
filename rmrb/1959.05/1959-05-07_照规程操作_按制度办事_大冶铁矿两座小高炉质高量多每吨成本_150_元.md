Operate According to Procedures, Handle Affairs According to Systems

Daye Iron Mine's Two Small Blast Furnaces Achieve High Quality, High Quantity, and a Cost of 150 Yuan Per Ton

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 6th dispatch) Daye Iron Mine's smelting workshop, starting with the implementation of technical operating procedures and the strengthening of technical learning, has ensured the balanced production of two eight-cubic-meter small blast furnaces and reduced the cost of pig iron from 220 yuan in February to 150 yuan in April. This workshop, after exceeding the first quarter plan by 10%, also exceeded the April production plan by 18.3%. The average utilization coefficient of these two furnaces in April was 1.24, with a maximum of 1.44; the average coke ratio was 1.19, with a minimum of 1.

Daye Iron Mine's two small blast furnaces were put into production in October last year and March this year, respectively. In order to achieve normal production and realize red ten-day periods, red months, and a red entire quarter, the workshop leadership widely mobilized the masses from the beginning, repeatedly debated and experimented around the key to production, and established a set of management systems from planning and technology to raw materials. For example, the time for workers to plug the taphole used to be inconsistent in practice, becoming one of the important keys in production. After mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, writing big-character posters, and various meetings, thoughts gradually unified. After many experiments, it was finally jointly stipulated that the taphole must be plugged within six to ten minutes after tapping. Now, each shift operates according to this system. They also adopted measures to increase smelting intensity, the main methods being to eliminate leaks and increase wind pressure, increasing the hot blast pressure from 75 mm to 120 mm and the wind temperature from 450 degrees Celsius to 550 degrees Celsius. After taking these measures, the daily pig iron production of each furnace has been stabilized at more than 10 tons. Recently, Furnace No. 2 adopted a multi-nozzle combustion method, raising the wind temperature to around 700 degrees, with a daily output exceeding 13 tons, a utilization coefficient reaching 1.62, a coke ratio dropping to 0.92, and a greatly improved pig iron quality, with sulfur content reduced to 0.08%. In addition, in order to control the particle size of raw materials, systems such as grading ore before charging and diligently sieving and selecting coke were also formulated. Workers conscientiously implemented these systems in production. Now, this workshop has formulated about 50 written operating procedures through worker discussions, enabling the operations of the three shifts to be unified.

Since more than 95% of the workers in this workshop are new workers with insufficient technical skills, while implementing operating procedures, they also organized workers to conduct technical learning around key issues. The learning method is to focus on problems to carry out debates, study books and materials and the experience of other units, explore experience through practical experiments, and explain and conduct practical operation examinations in groups and shifts using the five-character method of debate, learn, explore, explain, and examine. After this systematic study, the workers are now more skilled in technical operations, and most workers can independently handle general problems, and production has gradually improved.

　　照规程操作　按制度办事
    大冶铁矿两座小高炉质高量多每吨成本150元
    本报武汉6日电　大冶铁矿冶炼车间从贯彻技术操作规程和加强技术学习入手，保证了两座八立方公尺小高炉的均衡生产，并且使每吨生铁的成本由2月份的二百二十元，降到4月份的一百五十元。这个车间在超额10％完成第一季度计划后，又超额18.3％完成4月份生产计划。这两座炉子4月份的平均利用系数为一点二四，最高达到一点四四；焦比平均为一点一九最低为一。
    大冶铁矿的两座小高炉分别于去年10月和今年3月投入生产。车间领导为了做到正常生产，实现旬旬红月月红全季红，一开始便广泛发动了群众，围绕生产关键反复辩论、试验，建立了从计划、技术到原料的一套管理制度。例如，工人们堵出铁口的时间过去在做法上都互不一致，成为生产上的重要关键之一。经过发动群众鸣放、写大字报和各种会议讨论，思想逐渐统一，在多次试验以后，最后共同规定出铁口必须在出铁后六至十分钟内堵上的制度，现在各班都按照这个制度操作。他们还采取了提高冶炼强度的措施，主要的方法是杜绝漏洞，加大风压，把热风压力由过去的七十五公厘增加到一百二十公厘，风温由摄氏四百五十度提高到五百五十度，采取这些措施后，使每座炉子的生铁日产量都稳定在十吨以上。最近二号炉又采取多嘴燃烧的办法，把风温提高到七百度左右，日产超过了十三吨，利用系数达到一点六二，焦比降低到零点九二，生铁质量也大为提高，含硫量降低到0.08％。此外为了掌握原料的粒度，还制定了矿石分级入炉，焦炭勤筛勤选等制度。工人们在生产中都认真执行了这些制度。现在，这个车间经过工人讨论而订出成文的操作规程共达五十条左右，使三个班的操作得以统一起来。
    由于这个车间95％以上是新工人，技术操作不够熟练，在贯彻操作规程的同时，还围绕关键组织工人进行技术学习。学习的方法是集中问题开展辩论，学习书本材料和其他单位经验，通过实际试验摸索经验，分班分组讲解和进行实际操作考试的辩、学、摸、讲、考的五字法。工人经过这种系统的学习以后，现在技术操作比较熟练，大部分工人能够单独处理一般性的问题，生产也逐步提高。
