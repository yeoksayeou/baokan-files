Observations in Anhui
Speech by Committee Member Wu Bannong

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. I also fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report on the CPPCC. These reports summarize the astonishing miracles of China's comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958 and point out the prospects for our continued Great Leap Forward this year. The content is very rich and very insightful. I have only recently returned to China, my level is low, and I am seriously studying these important Marxist-Leninist documents. Recently, I visited my hometown of Anhui for more than twenty days, and everything I saw and heard filled me with excitement. Now, regardless of my shallowness, I would like to combine these observations and share a few very immature views.

The four major indicators of China's national economic development in 1959, in relative terms, although the growth rate is smaller than in 1958, the absolute figures far exceed last year. When the Party Central Committee initially proposed these indicators, I, because I only knew how to look at problems using the production standards of capitalist society, felt that the task was too difficult, and I couldn't figure out how it could be accomplished. To be honest, even the Great Leap Forward in 1958, I didn't know how it was achieved at the time. Recently, after seeing the situation in Anhui, I fully believe that as long as we continue to resolutely follow the mass line under the leadership of the Party, these indicators can absolutely be overfulfilled. This is not empty talk. I can cite many facts to support this.

Changed Past Impressions

1. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, China's material conditions today have been greatly enhanced. Take Anhui as an example. In my memory, this province in the past only had the Huainan Coal Mine, the Ma'anshan Iron Mine, and the Wuhu Yuzhong Textile Factory that were somewhat large-scale, but they were run in a half-dead state. Even if you add up other slightly decent factories, there were only fifty-seven factories at the time of liberation, and in 1957, it only increased to more than fifteen thousand nine hundred factories. But by the end of last year, it had surged to more than fifty-six thousand factories. In the past, Wuhu only had two or three chimneys, but today, especially after last year's Great Leap Forward, it has transformed from a consumer city into a production city with a forest of chimneys, mainly heavy industry. Northern Anhui is especially poor. In the past, the deepest impression I had was of famine and Fengyang flower-drum. But today, not only have six large reservoirs such as Foziling and Meishan and one thousand five hundred medium and small reservoirs been built, but also large-scale river network projects are being carried out. Two hundred of the eight hundred and eighty-two rivers have already been completed, and the communication projects of the Shi, Bi, and Hang three major rivers are also actively underway. The wish to "transform Northern Anhui into Jiangnan" will soon be realized. These conditions have laid a good foundation for this year's Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

This Year is Better Than Last Year

2. The industrial production Great Leap Forward in 1958 was mainly based on large-scale mass movements. For example, last year Anhui Province mobilized the whole Party and the entire people to run iron and steel in a big way. At its peak, more than seven million five hundred thousand people were mobilized, with three million people regularly maintained. Party committee secretaries all became furnace workers, and textile girls also became steel warriors. In just a few months, a total of one million and seven thousand tons of iron was produced, more than four times the amount in 1957, and one hundred and thirty thousand tons of steel, more than fifty-six times the amount in 1957. This year has entered the stage of consolidation and improvement. This year's task is to produce one million and seventy thousand tons of iron and five hundred thousand tons of steel, but due to the adoption of the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods, with foreign methods as the main focus," that is, what Premier Zhou called "transforming to so-called foreign production methods," only a dozen or so million people need to be involved. In terms of agriculture, if last year focused on experimental fields, this year focuses on large-area bumper harvests. We traveled in southern Anhui, and almost everywhere was an endless expanse of high-yielding fields, yellow rapeseed flowers, green wheat, and red fertilizer grass, growing densely, fat, and tall, which was truly exciting to see.

Even Great Droughts Can Yield Bumper Harvests

3. Through last year's Great Leap Forward and communization, the political consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses have been greatly improved. They truly dare to think and dare to do, and their energy is soaring. Anhui last year was a year of severe drought with one hundred days without rain. But because the masses, under the leadership of the Party, launched a hundred-li drought resistance movement, creating the mythical great feat of drawing river water to Zhaoguan, which is one hundred and twenty-eight meters high, they actually overcame the drought and achieved a bumper harvest. Grain production increased from 24.7 billion jin in 1957 to 42 billion jin; ginned cotton increased from 970,000 dan to 2.38 million dan, and oil crops also doubled. Anhui has a magnificent poem praising this great feat:

Cutting mountains to draw water to the highlands, commune members act as the Dragon King themselves,
Holding up Chaohu Lake as a water ladle, watering wherever there is drought.

For example, the masses on both sides of the Yangtze River in Anhui, in order to transmit electricity from the Foziling and Meishan reservoirs to Jiangnan, and because they could not obtain steel materials for a while, actually built a simple over-river wooden tower as high as seventy-two meters with wood. It has been transmitting electricity since last November. This time, when we crossed the river from Yuxikou to Wuhu, we also saw this power transmission tower, which created a miracle in the history of world construction engineering, standing on the river bank, encouraging people to continue to leap forward. These great feats cannot be understood by the capitalist world. Since last winter, after the rectification movement of the communes, the enthusiasm and creativity of the people have been further improved, and their energy has become even greater.

Technical Innovation Everywhere

4. Due to the large-scale technical innovation, this year's technical conditions have also been greatly increased. This year in Anhui, the labor required to smelt one ton of iron using small modern blast furnaces is only one-eighth of last year's. Last year, the coke ratio for steelmaking was two, and this year it has been reduced to 1.3. The improvement of tea picking technology is even more amazing. Take the Huangshan People's Commune that we visited as an example. In the past, each person could only pick an average of twenty or thirty jin of tea per day. Last year, a movement to exceed one hundred jin was launched, and two hundred and twenty-one tea picking experts who exceeded one hundred jin appeared, among whom Zhang Qinghe (female, Party member) created the highest record of 551.5 jin, and Xu Aizhen (female, League member) also picked 528.5 jin. This year, in order to improve production efficiency, another movement to exceed one thousand jin with "double-handed picking, fast picking, and multi-finger picking" was launched. The director of the commune told us that Comrade Zhang Qinghe has guaranteed to pick 1,500 jin per day. For tea processing equipment, it takes twenty-one workers per dan when operating completely by hand, seven workers with semi-mechanization, and only two workers when operating with power or hydraulic power. Now, the tea processing equipment of the Huangshan Commune has basically reached the level of semi-mechanization. Tea picking machines are also being designed and manufactured. And rice paddy transplanters have been successfully trial-produced and are now being widely promoted in Anhui. Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports all emphasized the importance of improving labor productivity, saving materials, and reducing costs. It can be seen that this important issue has been timely placed on this year's agenda.

Many Power Stations Have Been Built

5. Since last year, the working people of the whole country have explored many ways to "walk on two legs." Taking the construction of water conservancy and power generation as an example, in addition to using large dams to build large power plants, Anhui has also built many small power stations. Wuhu, one area alone, now has ninety-nine such small power stations and three hundred and three power stations. As long as an electric motor is installed, electricity can be generated immediately. We once visited the Shuangqiao People's Commune in Xuan City. That commune had eleven hydroelectric power stations, the largest was 160 kilowatts, and the smallest was only 3 kilowatts, with a total power generation of 290 kilowatts. The small 3-kilowatt power station in Shuangtangdian, Xuan City, was built with an expense of three thousand one hundred yuan in four days. The house was made of grass-roofed earthen walls, and all the equipment, except for a small electric motor, was made of wood, but it could also grind rice during the day and provide lighting at night. These small power stations will greatly reduce the gap between urban and rural areas and are an important way to solve big problems with small methods. Many people's communes in Anhui have proposed the slogan of electrification of the entire commune, and the commune members have already seen the prospects of a beautiful life where "lights are lit without oil, mills are pushed without hands, fields are plowed without oxen, operas are listened to without traveling, and streets are visited without walking."

Not Satisfied with the Original Task

6. After the enthusiasm of the workers and peasants has been improved, they are no longer satisfied with merely completing the tasks assigned by the Central Committee. For example, in the Wuhu Red Flag Machine Tool Factory, the workers are full of energy and often refuse to leave work. It is only after the Party committee persuades them that they are willing to stop working. The original plan was to produce 1,200 machine tools this year, but after the workers held a meeting and discussed it, it was increased to 1,800 units. The day before we visited, the entire factory's employees held an on-site meeting and raised the target to 2,000 units. In terms of rural people's communes, since the policy of graded management and three-level accounting was put forward, each brigade and production team has a plan that exceeds the tasks set by the higher authorities. These facts further guarantee that this year's Great Leap Forward can definitely be overfulfilled.

Eliminated Two Kinds of Superstition

7. After the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, the people's commune movement, the Great Leap Forward and the commune rectification movement, a large number of grassroots leading cadres with high political and professional levels have been cultivated in our country, which is a very favorable condition for today's Great Leap Forward. When we arrived in Hefei, Anhui Province was holding a 10,000-person meeting of six-level cadres to implement the Central Committee's policy of rectifying and building communes. By the time we visited several communes, the directors of each people's commune were able to understand the spirit of the Central Committee, combine it with their own work, and talk about a set of great principles. These directors are very young and their education levels are not high. For example, Director Qian of the Shushan People's Commune in Hefei is a young man of only twenty-seven or eight years old, and his education level is only equivalent to a primary school graduate or the first year of junior high school. But his two-hour conversation with us truly made us so-called senior intellectuals prostrate ourselves in admiration and feel ashamed. Old intellectuals often overestimate their own knowledge and underestimate their own physical strength. In fact, in the face of practical life, we are very ignorant. On the other hand, our physical strength is not as bad as we imagined. Our group of more than ten people (including an old man of seventy-four years old) took the opportunity of visiting the tea commune to tour Huangshan together. We spent half a day climbing over Yanwang Wall, passing through Yixiantian, and climbing all the way to Yupinglou. When we went down the mountain, we saw the steep cliffs along the way, and we really couldn't believe that we could climb such a peak. These two experiences dispelled two kinds of superstition of my own. I think this is also good for the transformation of old intellectuals.

Finally, I express my firm support for the government's wise policy of thoroughly suppressing the rebels and rescuing the Tibetan people in response to the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique. Now that the Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled, we are very happy to see that our Tibetan compatriots can finally be liberated from the serf system and leap forward with the people of the whole country to build socialism. We express our utmost anger at the expansionist elements in India who attempt to split China and interfere in our internal affairs, as well as the recent atrocities of instigating thugs to insult the image of our leader Chairman Mao. We want to solemnly warn the expansionists in India that your ignorant and stupid activities will only create trouble for India itself and will not have the slightest impact on our great cause of building socialism.

### 视察安徽见闻  吴半农委员的发言

专栏：

　　视察安徽见闻
    吴半农委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理的报告。我也完全同意李维汉副主席关于政协的工作报告。这些报告总结了我国一九五八年全面大跃进的惊人奇迹，并为我们指出了今年继续大跃进的前景，内容非常丰富、非常精辟。我回国不久，水平很低，正在认真学习这几个重要的马列主义文献。最近我在故乡安徽参观了二十多天，所见所闻，没有一件不使我兴奋。现在不顾浅陋，愿在这里结合这些观感，谈谈自己几点极不成熟的看法。
    一九五九年我国发展国民经济的四大指标，从相对数字来说，虽然比一九五八年的增长率要小一些，但绝对数字却大大超过去年。党中央最初提出这些指标时，我因为只会用资本主义社会的生产标准看问题，觉得任务过于艰巨，想不出怎样可以完成，老实说，就是一九五八年的大跃进，当时也不知道是怎样达成的。最近看了安徽的情况，我才完全相信，只要我们继续在党的领导下坚决走群众路线，这些指标是绝对可以超额完成的。这不是空话。我可以举出许多事实来做根据。
    改变了过去的印象
    一、在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国今天的物质条件已经大大增强了。拿安徽来说，我的记忆中，这个省份过去只有淮南煤矿、马鞍山铁矿和芜湖裕中纱厂稍具规模，但却办得不死不活。就是把其他稍微像样的工厂算在一起，解放时也只有五十七个厂，一九五七年才增加到一万五千九百多个厂。可是到去年年底，已激增到五万六千多个厂了。过去芜湖只有两、三个烟囱，而今天，尤其是经过去年的大跃进，已经由一个消费城市变成一个烟囱林立、以重工业为主的生产城市了。皖北尤其贫穷，过去给我最深的印象是逃荒和凤阳花鼓。可是今天，不但已经造了佛子岭、梅山等六个大型水库和一千五百个中小型水库，而且还在大搞河网化工程，八百八十二条河道已经完成二百多条，史、畀、杭三条大河的沟通工程也正在积极进行。“变淮北为江南”的愿望不久就可实现。这些条件都为今年的工农业生产大跃进打好良好的基础。
    今年比去年更好
    二、一九五八年的工业生产大跃进是以大搞群众运动为主。例如安徽去年全党全民大办钢铁，最多时动员了七百五十多万人，经常保持三百万人，党委书记都变成炉前工人，纺织姑娘也变成钢铁战士，短短几个月，一共炼出铁一百零七万吨，比一九五七年增加四倍多，钢十三万吨，比一九五七年增加五十六倍。今年已经进入巩固与提高的阶段。今年的任务是生产铁一百七十万吨、钢五十万吨，但由于采取“土洋结合，以洋为主”的方针，亦即周总理所说的“向所谓洋法生产转化”的结果，只需十几万人上阵了。农业方面，如果说去年着重搞试验田，今年则着重搞大面积丰收了。我们在皖南旅行，差不多到处都是一望无际的丰产田，黄的菜花、绿的小麦，红的肥料草，长得密密丛丛，又肥又高，看了真令人兴奋。
    大旱也能够丰收
    三、经过去年的大跃进和公社化，群众的政治觉悟和积极性、创造性已大大提高，真是敢想敢做、干劲冲天。安徽去年是一个百日不雨的大旱灾年。但由于群众在党的领导下发动了一个百里抗旱运动，造出把江水引到一百二十八公尺高的昭关的神话式的伟大事迹，居然战胜了旱灾，获得了丰收。粮食产量从一九五七年的二百四十七亿斤增加到四百二十亿斤；皮棉从九十七万担增加到二百三十八万担，油料也翻了一番。安徽有一首雄壮的诗赞美这个伟大事迹：
    劈山引水上高岗，社员自己当龙王，
    端起巢湖当水瓢，那方干旱那方浇。
    又如安徽长江两岸的群众，为了要把佛子岭和梅山水库的电输送到江南，而一时又弄不到钢料，居然用木材筑起一座高达七十二公尺的简易过江木塔，从去年十一月起已开始输电。这次我们从裕溪口过江到芜湖，还看到这座创世界建筑工程史上之奇迹的输电塔屹立在江边，鼓舞着人们继续跃进。这些伟大事迹都不是资本主义世界所能理解的。去冬以来，经过整社运动，人民的积极性和创造性更加提高，干劲也更大了。
    处处都革新技术
    四、由于大闹技术革新，今年的技术条件也已大大增高。今年安徽用小洋高炉炼一吨铁所需的人工，只需去年的八分之一了。去年炼钢的焦比为二，今年也已减到一点三。采茶技术的改进更是惊人。拿我们访问过的黄山人民公社为例，过去每人每天采茶普通只有二、三十斤，去年发动了一个超百斤运动，就出现了二百二十一名超百斤的采茶能手，其中张清和（女、党员）创造了五百五十一斤半的最高纪录，徐爱珍（女、团员）也采了五百二十八斤半。今年为了提高生产效率，又发动了一个“双手采、快速采、多指采”的超千斤运动，该社主任告诉我们说，张清和同志已保证要日采一千五百斤了。制茶设备，完全用手力操作每担需要二十一个工，半机械化需要七个工，而用动力或水力操作只需两个工，现在黄山公社的制茶设备已基本达到半机械化的程度了。采茶也正在设计制造机器。而稻田插秧机则已经试制成功，现在正在安徽广泛推行中。周总理和李富春、李先念副总理的报告里都着重指出提高劳动生产率、节约材料和降低成本的重要性。可见这个重要问题已及时地被提到今年的议事日程上来了。
    办起了许多电站
    五、去年以来，全国劳动人民已摸索出许多“两条腿走路”的办法。拿兴办水利发电来说，安徽除了利用大型水坝建造大型发电厂外，同时还搞了许多小型发电站。芜湖一个专区，现在就有九十九个这样的小型发电站，还有三百零三个动力站，只要装上电动机也可以马上发电。我们曾经参观过宣城双桥人民公社，那个公社就有十一所水力发电站，最大的是一百六十瓩，最小的只有三瓩，总的发电量已达二百九十瓩。三瓩的那所小发电站在宣城双塘店是用三千一百元的费用在四天之内搞起来的，房子是草顶土墙，所有设备除了一个小电动机外，都是木造的，但也能白天碾米，晚上照明。这些小型发电站将使城乡差异大大缩小，是用小办法解决大问题的一个重要途径。安徽许多人民公社已经提出全社电气化的口号，社员们已经看到“点灯不用油、推磨不用手、犁田不用牛、听戏不跑路、上街不用走”的美好生活的前景了。
    不满足原定任务
    六、工农群众的积极性提高后，他们已不满足于仅仅完成中央交下的任务。例如芜湖红旗机床厂，工人的干劲十足，常常不肯下班，要党委劝阻，才肯把工作停下，原定今年生产机床一千二百台，后经工人开会讨论增加为一千八百台，我们参观的前一天，全厂职工开了一个现场会议，又把指标提高到两千台。农村人民公社方面，自从提出分级管理、三级核算的方针后，每个大队和生产队都有超出上级所定任务的计划。这些事实更保证了今年的大跃进一定可以超额完成。
    破除了两种迷信
    七、经过整风、反右、人民公社化大跃进和整社运动已给我国培养出大批政治水平和业务水平都很高的基层领导干部，这是今天大跃进的一个非常有利的条件。我们到合肥时，安徽全省正在召开六级干部的万人会议，以贯彻中央整社建社的方针。等到我们访问几个公社的时候，各人民公社的主任都已能体会中央的精神、结合自己的业务，谈出一套大道理来。这些主任的年龄都很轻，文化水平也不高，例如合肥蜀山人民公社的钱主任还是一个二十七、八岁的青年，文化水平只抵得上高小毕业或初中一的程度。但他和我们的两小时谈话，真使我们这些所谓高级知识分子五体投地、自愧不如。旧知识分子往往把自己的知识估计得过高，而把自己的体力估计得过低。其实在实践生活面前，我们是非常无知的。而另一方面，我们的体力反倒不像我们所想像的那样不行。我们一行十多人（包括一位七十四岁的老人）曾利用访问茶叶公社的时机，结伴游览了黄山。我们用了半天的工夫，爬过阎王壁、穿过一线天，一直爬到玉屏楼。下山的时候，看到沿路的悬岩峭壁，真不相信自己还能攀登这样的高峰。这两次经验破除了自己两种迷信，我想这对于旧知识分子的改造也是有好处的。
    最后，对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱，我表示坚决拥护政府彻底平息叛匪、解救西藏人民的英明政策。现在西藏叛乱已基本上平息，我们非常高兴看到西藏的同胞终于能够从农奴制度下解放出来，和全国人民一起为建设社会主义而跃进。对于印度扩张主义分子企图分裂中国、干涉我国内政的阴谋以及最近怂恿暴徒侮辱我国领袖毛主席像的暴行，我们表示万分的愤怒。我们要正告印度的扩张主义者，你们这些不识时务的愚蠢活动只会为印度自寻烦恼，对于我们建设社会主义的伟大事业是不会有丝毫影响的。
