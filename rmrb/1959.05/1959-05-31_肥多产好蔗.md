More Fertilizer, Better Sugarcane Yield
    Feng Mingyi

    The sugarcane fields of the Sanhe Brigade of the Fucheng Commune in Guixian County, Guangxi, are the most barren in the entire Yulin Special District. However, the sugarcane grown there is currently the best in the Yulin Special District. Why can good sugarcane grow on barren land? In a word, they have focused on fertilizer.

    Sanhe Brigade is an old sugarcane area, and it has increased production year after year for several years. There are many reasons for the increased production, but the main one is the increased application of fertilizer. In 1957 and 1958, the sugarcane was fertilized adequately. This year, 500 dan of base fertilizer have already been applied, and now more than 500 dan per mu have been transported to the fields. The Party branch of the Sanhe Brigade, based on the fact that the land in its brigade is barren and must be heavily fertilized, has made fertilizer accumulation a link that runs through every production process. After several years of exploration, a fertilizer accumulation system has gradually been established.

    The most profound impression this brigade gives people is "fertilizer fills the fields and the villages." The adobe houses are piled with fertilizer, the outdoor compost yards are piled with fertilizer, the ox carts coming and going on the roads are carrying fertilizer, the edges of the fields are also piled with fertilizer, and the manure pits at the ends of the fields are still storing fertilizer. Each production team in the brigade has four or five large ash houses for fermenting concentrated fertilizer, and each ash house can store 300 to 400 dan of fertilizer. All the sugarcane areas of the brigade have dug a manure pit at the end of every 15 to 20 mu, specifically for using field weeds, green leaves, plus some human and animal manure to ferment liquid fertilizer. Each pit has a capacity of 500 to 1,000 dan or more, which can ensure that sugarcane can be fertilized with liquid fertilizer twice a month during the dry summer and autumn seasons. Now the eastern cultivated land has been completed according to plan, with a total of 270 field-end manure pits; the western cultivated land is a newly developed sugarcane area and only 30 have been built, which will be completed within this year. Here, compost yards are truly all over the villages and fields, with fertilizer piles large and small, the small ones with several thousand dan, and the large ones with more than ten thousand dan.

    The raw materials used for composting here are very extensive. All grass roots, sugarcane stalks, sugarcane leaves, garbage, sod, weeds, and all plant roots, stems, and leaves that can be rotted are used to compost. They ferment what they find in the village near the village, and they ferment what they find in the fields near the fields. They mix these plant roots, stems, and leaves with mud fertilizer (pond mud, ditch mud, subsoil) and heap them together, often watering them with liquid fertilizer or miscellaneous water to keep them moist. The compost is turned over once every three months, and the coarse materials are picked out before it can be used. Compost is generally accumulated in winter for use in spring, and accumulated in spring for use in summer, cycle after cycle, accumulating fertilizer year-round, with fertilizer available year-round. Cattle pens are also a good place for making fertilizer, and they have made full use of them. The method is to use raw sod to pad the cattle pen, adding more when it is wet, and changing it every three months. Each time, each pen can yield 50 carts of fertilizer.

    The growth characteristics of sugarcane are that it needs to "eat a lot," both concentrated fertilizer and coarse fertilizer are needed. The masses say this is: "When hungry, one doesn't choose food; sugarcane doesn't choose fertilizer." The Sanhe Brigade's approach to accumulating fertilizer precisely meets this characteristic. Their accumulation and production of fertilizer is carried out continuously throughout the year. Each production team has established a specialized team for accumulating fertilizer regularly. The responsibility of the specialized team is to accumulate and produce fertilizer. It usually spends all its time on fertilizer work, and even during the busy farming season, it only spends half a day participating in rush farming tasks, and still accumulates and produces fertilizer in the morning and evening. The specialized team focuses on accumulating concentrated fertilizer, such as collecting manure from various government offices and schools, etc. At the same time, they also conduct regular fertilizer accumulation with the keepers of animals. In addition to the specialized team accumulating fertilizer, they also conduct rush accumulation of fertilizer after each farming stage is completed. They pay close attention to this point. Each production team, after completing its own tasks, quickly turns to accumulating fertilizer.

    Here, the labor management for fertilizer accumulation, like other farm work, is implemented on a piece-rate basis, with more pay for more work, and rewards for exceeding quotas. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the commune members for accumulating fertilizer is very high, and they strive to exceed the tasks assigned to them. (Attached picture)

    肥多产好蔗
    冯明仪
    广西贵县附城公社三合大队的蔗田是全玉林专区最瘦瘠的，但是它这里种植的甘蔗却是玉林专区目前甘蔗生长得最好的一个大队。瘦地为什么会长出好甘蔗呢？一句话就是抓住了肥料。
    三合大队是一个老蔗区，几年来连年增产。增产原因固然很多，但主要的一条是增施肥料。1957年和1958年每亩甘蔗施肥都很足。今年基肥已施放五百担，现在运到田的每亩又有五百多担。三合大队党支部根据本队土地瘦瘠，必须多放肥料的情况，把积肥作为贯串每一个生产环节的链条，经过几年的摸索，积肥制度逐渐建立起来了。
    这个大队给人们最深刻的印象是“肥料满垌又满庄”，土灰房里堆的是肥料，屋外堆肥场堆的是肥料，路上来来往往牛车运的是肥料，田边堆满的也是肥料，田头粪坑储的还是肥料。大队的每个生产队都有沤制精肥的大型灰房四、五个，每个灰房能贮肥三、四百担。大队的全部蔗区都按十五至二十亩挖一田头粪坑，专供利用田间杂草、绿叶加上一些人畜粪便沤制水肥。每个坑容量五百至一千担以上，在夏秋季干旱的时候，可以保证甘蔗每月能施水肥两次。现在东片耕地已全部按计划完成，共计有田头粪坑二百七十个；西片耕地是刚发展的新蔗区，才建好三十个，今年内也要全部完成。这里的堆肥场真是遍布村庄和田间，肥堆有大有小，小的有几千担，大的有万担以上。
    这里采用的沤肥原料非常广泛，凡草根、蔗茎、蔗叶、垃圾、草皮、杂草和一切能沤得腐烂的植物根、茎、叶都利用来沤制堆肥。他们在村里找到的就在村边沤制，在地里找到的就在地边沤制。他们把这些植物根茎叶和泥肥（塘泥、沟泥、地底泥）混合堆沤，经常用水肥或杂水淋，保持湿润，堆沤三个月翻一次，拣去粗的就可以使用了。堆肥一般是冬积春用，春积夏用，周而复始，长年积肥，长年有肥。牛栏也是制肥的好地方，他们已充分利用起来了。办法是用生草皮垫牛栏，湿了又加，三个月换一次，每次每栏可得肥料五十车。
    甘蔗的生育特点是要“大吃”，精肥粗肥都需要，群众说这是：“饥不择食，蔗不择肥”。三合大队积肥的作法正是符合这个特点。他们积肥制肥是常年不断地进行的，每个生产队都成立了经常积肥的专业队。专业队的责任是积肥、制肥。它平时是全部时间都搞肥料工作，农忙时也只抽出半天参加突击性的农活，早晚还是进行积肥制肥。专业队积肥以精肥为主，如到各机关学校收集粪便等，同时，他们也和饲养员一起进行经常性的积肥。除了专业队积肥外，他们在每一个农活阶段结束后，还进行突击性的积肥。他们对这一点是抓得很紧的。每个生产队一完成自己的任务后，就迅速转入积肥。
    这里在积肥方面的劳动管理，也和其他农活一样实行按件记分，多劳多得，超额奖励，因此，社员积肥情绪很高，对所分配的任务都力争超额完成。（附图片）
