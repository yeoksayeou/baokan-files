Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I enthusiastically support Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 national final accounts and the 1959 national budget draft, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC.

　　First, I would like to say a few words about the Tibetan rebellion. Tibet is a part of Chinese territory, which even imperialist elements cannot deny. Recently, the Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary group colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries to launch an armed rebellion. The Chinese government, in order to protect the interests of the majority of the Tibetan people, is carrying out suppression of the rebellion, which is entirely China's internal affair. Unexpectedly, some expansionists and certain politicians in India falsely claim that the Tibetan people are not Chinese, that the Tibetan rebellion is an uprising, and that our suppression of the rebellion is national oppression; and in Tezpur, Indian Foreign Ministry officials distributed a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" against China. These remarks and actions seriously violate the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and unscrupulously interfere in China's internal affairs. I feel extremely indignant! I fully support all the government's measures in handling the Tibetan rebellion, and at the same time I warn the imperialist elements and foreign reactionaries that the Chinese people have stood up, and the era in which China was bullied and oppressed has gone forever. You should be clear-headed; the Chinese people love peace and advocate peaceful coexistence, but they are not weak and easily bullied. Any foreign reactionary force that wants to separate Tibet from China, that wants to prevent Tibet from advancing along the path of democracy and socialism, will inevitably be met with a strong counterattack from the Chinese people and will certainly suffer a shameful defeat!

　　I am a technical worker in the steel industry, and now I would like to express some opinions on how to complete the national four major targets for 1959, including 18 million tons of steel.

　　1958 was a year of comprehensive great leap forward in China's national economy, and also an unprecedented great leap forward in history. In this year, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, a vigorous mass movement of running steel by the whole people was launched, and the task of doubling steel production was successfully completed. According to the national plan, 13.69 million tons of iron were completed, an increase of 131 percent compared with 1957, and 11.08 million tons of steel were completed, an increase of 107 percent compared with 1957. In such a situation of an unprecedented great leap forward in steel production, the broad masses eliminated superstition, liberated their minds, and carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Many excellent production indicators and advanced production experiences emerged on the production technology front. For example, the Benxi No. 1 Blast Furnace Workshop, by improving the quality of raw materials, increasing the wind temperature, and strengthening smelting, created an advanced indicator of an annual average of 1,826 tons and a good monthly average of 2,265 tons for the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace (iron production per cubic meter of volume per day and night); Taiyuan Steel Plant created the method of tapping steel from three open-hearth furnace spouts, reversing the backward situation in production. Other great creations of the masses include mixed steelmaking in electric furnaces and converters, rapid firing of refractory materials, and the use of nodular cast iron rolls in primary rolling mills. This great leap forward changed the situation of the steel industry, raising China's steel production from eleventh to seventh place in the world, basically meeting the needs of national economic development.

　　The 1959 steel production plan is a great leap forward plan.

　　The 1959 steel production plan was put forward on the basis of the great leap forward in steel in 1958. The steel production target is 18 million tons, an increase of 6.92 million tons compared with 1958, an increase of 62 percent. The iron production target is 23 million tons, an increase of 9.3 million tons compared with 1958, an increase of 68 percent. From the perspective of percentages, the growth target for steel production in 1959 is lower than the growth number in 1958, but from the perspective of the absolute growth number, it is indeed a very large number. No country in the capitalist world has ever achieved such an astonishing increase in steel production capacity in one year. After the completion of this plan, the face of China's steel industry will undergo major changes. Not only will there be large backbone enterprises directly under the central government, but also many small and medium-sized enterprises will be established in various provinces and cities, which can supply various steel products locally, creating favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of China's national economy in the future. At the same time, after the completion of this plan, China's steel production will exceed that of Japan and France and rank fifth in the world, approaching the level of British steel production in 1958. What an encouraging leap forward plan this is. Of course, completing such a plan is not easy. From the perspective of ironmaking capacity, producing 9.3 million tons of iron annually is equivalent to building several Wuhan Iron and Steel Plants. Every year, it requires more than 16 million tons of ore and about 24 million tons of coking coal, which is equivalent to requiring the completion of more than a dozen large iron mines, twenty to thirty pairs of large coal mines, dozens of coal washing plants, and dozens of large coke ovens in one year. The construction of these plants and mines requires hundreds of thousands of tons of equipment, and the input into production requires the supply of hundreds of thousands of kilowatts of electricity. The amount of transportation within and outside the plant can reach tens of millions of tons. This is indeed a glorious and arduous task, which also shows that the 1959 steel production plan is a great leap forward plan.

　　Can we complete such an unprecedented leap forward plan in history? We can definitely complete it. First of all, the comprehensive great leap forward in industry in 1958 laid the material foundation for the continued great leap forward in 1959; secondly, the great leap forward in the steel industry in 1958, with steel as the key link, accumulated rich technical experience and work experience. More importantly, the broad masses of cadres and the people have raised their awareness and, under the leadership of the Party, have implemented the policy of several simultaneous developments and walking on two legs, which has led the development of the steel industry to a new stage. Therefore, as long as we move forward along the correct path today, mobilize the broad masses, and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements around the current key production issues, explore potentials and find solutions, we have the confidence to complete the task of 18 million tons of steel in 1959.

　　Where is the key to completing 18 million tons of steel? In my personal opinion, the first is iron. Without iron, there is no steel, and without steel, there is no steel material. Without steel materials, all production and construction are out of the question. Where is the problem with iron? According to this year's production plan, large and small blast furnaces each account for half of the iron production task. Large blast furnaces have had a production foundation for several years. Although it is still necessary to continue to tap potentials and increase production, there is not much problem in completing the plan. The situation of small blast furnaces is very different. From the perspective of equipment, there are currently thousands of small blast furnaces that can be put into production, and the total volume is more than twice that of large blast furnaces. Moreover, some provinces and cities are still under construction, and the total production potential is very large; however, there are currently many problems in production, mainly the low furnace opening rate and effective volume utilization coefficient, high costs, and poor quality of pig iron; therefore, how to take effective measures to overcome various difficulties and fully exploit the production potential of existing small blast furnaces is a key issue in completing this year's pig iron plan. The second is steel. In the 1959 steel production task, converter steel accounts for a considerable proportion. Currently, open-hearth furnace and electric furnace production are on track, although it is still necessary to continue to improve on the existing basis to ensure the completion of the plan. The converter situation is different from this. In the great leap forward of the steel industry in 1958, thousands of converters were newly built across the country. Except for the Shanghai, Tangshan, Xinxing, and Guxian four plants, which have a relatively solid foundation, the other plants are newly built units. Most of these newly built workshops are simple in design, with small factory areas, insufficient auxiliary equipment, and unable to operate normally; in addition, the manufacturing and installation quality of the equipment is poor, the operation is not smooth, and accidents occur frequently, which increases the difficulties in production; in addition, the quality of raw materials is poor, the workers are not skilled in technology, and the production organization work cannot meet the requirements, causing some confusion in production. Therefore, how to quickly take concrete measures to improve the design and equipment and master the operating technology so that converter production gradually gets on the right track is one of the primary tasks for completing 18 million tons of steel. As for this year's steel task, although the growth ratio is very large and the number of newly built rolling mills is very large, steel depends on steel. Without steel, there is no steel material. Therefore, I will only focus on how to promote the production of small blast furnaces and converters.

　　What are the main problems existing in the production of small blast furnaces and converters, and how to solve them? This is the basic link in whether the steel industry can leap forward. If the problems in this area are not solved, iron and steel production will not go up. In my personal opinion, the following problems must be solved quickly:

　　Improve the supply and quality of coke.

　　First is improving the supply and quality of coke - this problem directly affects the output of small blast furnaces and converters and the quality of iron and steel. To solve this problem, we must start from two aspects. First, the coal supply department should supply coking coal on time, in quantity, in quality, and in variety, so that the coking department can supply blast furnace and cupola coke on time, in quality, and in quantity. At present, due to insufficient coke supply, some small blast furnaces have failed to fully exploit their capacity. Although the supply of coking coal has slightly improved recently, it still cannot meet the needs; more importantly, most areas can only supply raw coal, with too high ash and sulfur content, and some areas supply the wrong type of coal, which greatly affects the quality of coke; therefore, in addition to vigorously increasing the production of coking coal, the coal supply department also hopes to accelerate the construction of simple coal washing plants and indigenous coal washing yards, and strive to supply washed coal as much as possible. At the same time, the types of coal should be adjusted by region to ensure the quality of coke. Second, in terms of coking, we should simultaneously develop both indigenous and foreign methods and vigorously develop simple coke ovens and indigenous coke ovens. Given that there are very few foreign coke ovens and construction takes time, which cannot meet the needs, we must currently seize the construction of a large number of combined indigenous and foreign No. 2 and No. 3 simple coke ovens. Even if these coke ovens are built and completed, they still cannot meet the needs; therefore, it is also necessary to build some Tangshan-style or Pingxiang-style indigenous coke ovens to ensure supply. However, in order to ensure quality, foreign coke ovens, indigenous coke ovens, and combined indigenous and foreign simple coke ovens should gradually be converted to using washed coal as raw material.

　　Solve the problem of equipment matching and equipment transformation.

　　Secondly, the problem of equipment matching and equipment transformation - the newly built blast furnaces and converters in 1958 were relatively simple in the original design in order to strive for construction speed, and the manufacturing and installation quality of the equipment was also poor. Most workshops have insufficient auxiliary equipment, and even lack some necessary production equipment and tools. Some workshops have small factory areas, and the transportation system is not well considered, so that they cannot be put into production for a long time after construction is completed, or they cannot operate normally after being put into production. This phenomenon is prominently manifested in the newly built converter workshops. Some of the newly built blast furnace workshops also have some equipment that has not been matched. Most of the workshops that have been put into production have insufficient fan capacity, and some blast furnace body structures and hot blast stoves need to be transformed. In order to exploit the potential capacity of existing small blast furnaces and converters, resolute measures should be taken to give priority to the allocation of equipment and strive to quickly match the equipment that has not been put into production and put it into production as soon as possible; the equipment that has been put into production should be technically transformed and supplemented with equipment during maintenance opportunities. This is the most effective way to tap the existing capacity of small blast furnaces and converters. It requires less equipment, faster time, and less investment than building new plants, which is in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and should be resolutely and rapidly promoted.

　　Offer suggestions and plans for ironmaking and iron allocation.

　　The third is the problem of iron allocation: in the great leap forward of the steel industry in 1958, most of the newly built converter workshops were attached to existing key steel plants, while small blast furnaces were blooming everywhere and distributed in various provinces, cities, and regions; therefore, a new situation has arisen in the steel industry. Except for Anshan Iron and Steel, Benxi Iron and Steel, Shijingshan Iron and Steel, and Longyan Iron and Steel Companies, the remaining major steel plants need iron to be allocated from various provinces. Without iron, steel cannot be made. Therefore, the problem of iron allocation has become an important condition for whether the steel production task can be completed. Since the fourth quarter of last year, allocating iron to key steel plants has become an important task. Recently, the supply of pig iron is still insufficient, which has affected the production of some converter workshops. The reasons for the difficulty in iron allocation vary. Some areas may not have been able to concentrate on time due to transportation difficulties; some areas may not have been able to allocate iron because the pig iron plan was not completed; however, in addition, there are still many problems in the allocation and use of pig iron in various provinces. According to the statistics of pig iron and steel production in the first quarter, only about 52 percent of all pig iron was used for steelmaking. In addition, after deducting the foundry iron allocated to key factories, the pig iron retained locally accounted for a large proportion. According to the statistics of the past few years in our country, more than 75 percent of the total annual pig iron is used for steelmaking. Referring to the statistics of other industrial countries, pig iron used for steelmaking accounts for 78 to 88 percent, generally about 80 percent. If calculated according to using 75 percent of pig iron for steelmaking, the iron produced in the first quarter can completely meet the needs of completing the steelmaking task in the first quarter, and there will be no reduction in production due to lack of iron. The above situation shows that there is a serious unreasonable phenomenon in our allocation and use of pig iron, which may also be one of the main reasons for the difficulty in iron allocation. In order to ensure the need for pig iron for steelmaking, it is recommended that various provinces and cities refer to the above figures to stipulate the proportion of non-steelmaking iron. If there is insufficient iron, a unified queuing method should be adopted to ensure key projects, so as not to use the not-so-abundant pig iron for secondary purposes, which will hinder the growth of steel production. Secondly, we should mobilize the masses to vigorously promote advanced experiences and carry out a socialist competition movement for high yield and high quality centered on technical revolution. Since the great leap forward in the steel industry, the political awareness of the broad masses of cadres and people has been raised. Under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, many advanced red flags and advanced production experiences have emerged in the small blast furnace and converter workshops of various enterprises. For example, the output of the 35M3 blast furnace in Shuicheng, Guizhou, reached 1.27 tons per cubic meter of volume per day in 1958, and the highest monthly output reached more than 1.6 tons. The average coke consumption per ton of pig iron was less than one ton, and the sulfur content and unit cost of pig iron were close to those of large blast furnaces. Generally, the daily output of iron per cubic meter of volume of small blast furnaces is only 0.5 to 0.7 tons, and the coke consumption per ton of pig iron is 1.5 to 2 tons, or even more than 2 tons. The same is true for converters. Although the general level is very low, the average steel output per ton of capacity per day of the converter of the Sixth Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company reached 49.4 tons in 1958, the pig iron consumption per ton of steel ingot was about 1.3 tons, and the qualified rate was more than 95 percent. The output of general converters differs by several times from this advanced unit, and the pig iron consumption and qualified rate also differ greatly. Therefore, in order to rapidly increase the output of small blast furnaces and converters and the quality of steel products, we should further carry out the socialist competition movement for high yield and high quality centered on technical revolution, widely mobilize the masses to promote key advanced experiences, such as the multi-mouth combustion tube hot blast furnace, increasing smelting intensity, reducing the size of ore, and grading ore loading in small blast furnaces; and experiences such as alkaline cupolas, slag retention operation, and three rows of air eyes in converters. More importantly, enterprise leaders should disclose the bottom line to the masses, mobilize the broad masses of employees, and carry out big debates with great fanfare, big character posters, and big debates around the current key issues in production. The wisdom of the masses is infinite. As long as the problems are handed over to the masses, they can always be solved quickly. In the movement to carry out the technical revolution, we should mobilize all positive factors. In addition to convening four-level and five-level cadre meetings administratively and fully listening to the opinions of grassroots cadres, various provinces, cities, and enterprises should also cooperate with local science and technology associations to mobilize the enthusiasm of members of local metallurgical societies, so that experts and the masses can combine and work together to offer suggestions and plans for major problems in production and strive to complete 18 million tons of steel.

　　Fellow committee members: 1959 is a decisive year in our country's three years of hard work, and it is also a year of continued great leap forward in the steel industry. The task is arduous, but under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, relying closely on the masses and adhering to the general line of building socialism, we believe that we will definitely be able to complete this glorious task. As a steel metallurgist, I am willing to go all out with the millions of steel workers across the country and strive to contribute all my strength to complete the task of 18 million tons of steel!

　　努力完成今年钢铁生产计划
    王之玺委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我热烈地拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告、李维汉副主席政协常务委员会工作报告。
    我首先对西藏叛乱事件谈几句话。西藏是中国领土的一部分，就是帝国主义分子也不能否认。最近西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，发动了武装叛乱，中国政府为了保护西藏大多数人民的利益进行戡乱，这完全是中国的内政问题。不料印度国内一部分扩张主义者和某些政治家谬称西藏人民不是中国人，西藏叛乱是起义，我们平乱是民族压迫；并且在提斯浦尔由印度外交部官员散发反对中国的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这些言论和行动严重的违反了和平共处的五项原则，毫无忌惮的干涉中国内政，我感到万分的愤慨！我完全拥护政府处理西藏叛乱的一切措施，同时我警告帝国主义分子和外国反动派，中国人民已经站起来了，中国任人欺侮和压迫的时代已经一去不复返了，你们要放清醒一点，中国人民爱好和平，提倡和平共处，并不是软弱可欺；任何外国反动力量，想把西藏从中国分裂出去，想阻止西藏沿着民主和社会主义的道路前进，必将受到中国人民的有力反击，一定遭到可耻的失败！
    我是钢铁方面的技术工作者，现在就如何完成一九五九年国家四大指标中一千八百万吨钢发表一些意见。
    一九五八年是我国国民经济全面大跃进的一年，也是历史上空前大跃进的一年，这一年中在党中央的正确领导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的全民办钢铁的群众运动，胜利地完成了钢产量翻一番的任务，根据国家计划铁完成了一千三百六十九万吨，比一九五七年增长了百分之一百三十一，钢完成了一千一百零八万吨，比一九五七年增长了百分之一百零七，在这样一个钢铁生产空前大跃进的形势下，广大群众，破除了迷信，解放了思想，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，在生产技术战线上出现了很多优异的生产指标和先进生产经验。如本溪一高炉车间通过改进原料质量提高风温及冶炼强度，高炉利用系数（每立方公尺容积每昼夜产铁量）创造了全年平均一千八百二十六吨，良好月二千二百六十五吨的先进指标；太原钢厂创造了平炉三槽出钢的方法，扭转了生产落后的局面。其他如电炉转炉混合炼钢，耐火材料快速烧成，初轧机采用球墨铸铁轧辊等都是群众的伟大创造。这个大跃进结果改变了钢铁工业的形势，使我国钢产量由世界的第十一位提高到第七位，基本上满足了国民经济发展的需要。
    一九五九年的钢铁生产计划是一个伟大的跃进计划
    一九五九年钢铁的生产计划是在一九五八年钢铁大跃进的基础上提出来的，钢产一千八百万吨，比一九五八年提高了六百九十二万吨，增长百分之六十二，铁产量二千三百万吨，比一九五八年提高九百三十万吨，增长了百分之六十八。从百分数来看，一九五九年钢铁产量增长指标比一九五八年的增长数低了，但是从增长绝对数字上看确是一个非常巨大的数字，资本主义世界中还没有那一个国家在那一个时期，一年中钢铁生产能力的增长达到这样一个惊人的数字。完成了这个计划以后，我国钢铁工业的面貌将获得重大改变，不仅有了中央直属的骨干大企业，各省市都建立起不少中小型企业，就地可以供应各种钢材，对我国今后国民经济的全面发展创造了有利条件。同时完成了这个计划，我国钢产量将超过日本和法国而跃居世界第五位，接近了一九五八年英国的钢产量水平，这是多么令人鼓舞的一个跃进计划。当然，完成这样一个计划并不是轻而易举的，从炼铁能力来看年产生铁九百三十万吨，等于建设几个武钢，每年需要矿石一千六百万吨以上，炼焦煤二千四百万吨左右，等于要求一年内完成十几个大铁矿，二十对到三十对大煤井，几十座洗煤场，几十座大型焦炉，建设这些厂矿需要设备几十万吨，投入生产时需要供应几十万瓩的电力，厂内厂外运输量可达几千万吨，这确是一个光荣而艰巨的任务，同时也说明了一九五九年的钢铁生产计划是一个伟大的跃进计划。
    我们能不能完成这样一个历史上空前的跃进计划呢？肯定能完成。首先一九五八年的工业全面大跃进，为一九五九年的继续大跃进打下了物质基础；其次是一九五八年在以钢为纲，钢铁工业大跃进中积累了丰富的技术经验和工作经验，更重要的是广大干部和群众提高了觉悟，在党的领导下，贯彻执行了几个并举和两条腿走路的方针，使钢铁工业的发展走上了新的阶段，因此我们今天只要沿着正确的道路前进，发动广大群众，围绕着当前生产上的关键问题开展技术革新、技术革命运动，挖潜力想办法，一九五九年一千八百万吨钢的任务，我们有信心一定能够完成。
    完成一千八百万吨钢关键问题在哪里？我个人意见认为首先是铁，没有铁就没有钢，没有钢就没有材，没有钢材一切生产建设都谈不到。铁的问题在哪里？根据今年的生产计划，生铁的任务大小高炉各占半数。大高炉几年来生产已有基础，虽然还需要继续挖掘潜力，提高生产，但是完成计划上问题不大。而小高炉情况则大不相同，从设备上看，小高炉目前可投入生产的已有几千座，总容积相当大高炉的两倍以上，并且有些省市还在建设，总的生产潜力很大；但是目前生产上问题很多，主要是开炉率和有效容积利用系数较低，成本较高，生铁质量不够好；因此如何采取有效措施，克服各项困难，充分发挥现有小高炉的生产潜力，这对于完成今年生铁计划是一个关键问题。其次是钢，一九五九年钢的生产任务中转炉钢占的比重不小。目前平炉、电炉生产已上轨道，虽然还需要在现有基础上继续提高，以保证计划的完成。转炉情况则与此不同，一九五八年钢铁工业大跃进中，全国新建了转炉几千座，除去上海、唐山、新兴、故县四厂较有基础以外，其他各厂都是新建单位，这些新建车间在设计上多半是因陋就简，厂房面积狭小，辅助设备不足，无法正常生产；加以设备制造及安装质量较差，运转不灵，事故频繁，增加了生产上的困难；加以原料质量不好，工人技术不熟练，生产组织工作不能适应要求，造成了生产上的某些混乱情况，因此如何迅速采取具体措施，改进设计及设备，掌握操作技术，使转炉生产逐步走上正轨，是当前完成一千八百万吨钢的首要任务之一。至于今年钢材的任务虽然增长比例很大，新建轧机数量很多，但是钢材决定于钢，没有钢就没有钢材，因此我只重点的谈一谈如何促进小高炉与转炉的生产问题。
    小高炉和转炉的生产究竟存在哪些主要问题，如何来解决？是当前钢铁工业能否跃进的基本环节，这方面的问题不解决，铁和钢的生产上不去。我个人意见当前必须迅速解决以下几个问题：
　　改进焦炭的供应与质量问题
    首先是改进焦炭的供应与质量问题——这个问题直接影响到小高炉和转炉的产量与铁和钢的质量。要解决这个问题必须从两方面入手，第一、煤炭供应部门应按时按量按质按品种供应炼焦用煤，这样炼焦部门才能按时按质按量供应高炉及化铁炉焦炭，目前因焦炭供应不足，一部分小高炉未能充分发挥能力，最近炼焦煤供应情况虽略有好转，但仍不能满足需要；更重要的是大部分地区只能供应原煤，灰分和硫黄太高，还有部分地区供应煤种不合，大大影响了焦炭的质量；因此煤炭供应部门除大力增产炼焦煤以外，还希望加速简易洗煤与土法洗煤场的建设，争取尽量供应洗煤，同时按地区调整煤种，以保证焦炭的质量。第二、炼焦方面，要土洋并举，大力发展简易焦炉与土焦炉，鉴于洋焦炉数量很少，建设需时，不能满足需要；目前必需抓紧建设大量土洋结合的二号及三号简易焦炉，在这些焦炉建设时间及建设完成后仍不能满足需要；因此还需要建设一些唐山式或萍乡式的土焦炉以保证供应。但是为保证质量，洋焦炉、土焦炉和土洋结合的简易焦炉都应逐渐改为以洗煤为原料。
　　解决设备配套和设备改造问题
    其次是设备配套及设备改造问题——一九五八年新建高炉和转炉，因争取建设速度，原设计比较简陋，设备制造及安装质量也较差，大部分车间辅助设备不足，甚至缺乏一部分必要的生产设备和工具，还有些车间厂房面积狭小，运输系统考虑不周，以致建设完工后长时期不能投入生产或投入生产后不能正常操作，这种现象突出地表现在新建转炉车间。新建高炉车间也有一部分设备未能配套；已投入生产的车间大部分风机能力不足，还有些高炉炉体结构及热风炉需要改造。为了发挥小高炉及转炉现有设备的潜在能力，应采取坚决的措施优先拨给设备，争取迅速地将未投入生产的设备配好套，早日投入生产；已投入生产的设备利用检修机会，进行技术改造，并补充设备；这是挖掘小高炉和转炉现有能力的最有效办法，比建设新厂设备少，时间快，投资省，符合多快好省的原则，应该坚决地、迅速地加以推行。
　　献计献策炼铁调铁
    再次是调铁问题：一九五八年钢铁工业大跃进中，新建转炉车间大部分附设在现有的重点钢厂，而小型高炉则遍地开花，分布在各省市各地区；因此钢铁工业中就产生一个新的情况，重点企业中除去鞍钢、本溪、石景山、龙烟等公司外，其余几个主要钢厂都需要由各省调铁，无铁不能炼钢，因此调铁问题便形成了能否完成钢产任务的重要条件。从去年四季起为重点钢厂调铁已经变为一个重要任务，最近期间生铁供应仍然不足，以致部分转炉车间生产受了影响。调铁困难的原因不一，部分地区可能由于运输困难，未能按期集中；有些地区可能因为生铁没有完成计划未能调出；但是除此而外，各省在生铁的分配使用上还存在着不少问题，根据第一季生铁及钢产量的统计，全部生铁用于炼钢的只有百分之五十二左右，另外扣除拨给重点工厂的铸造铁以外，地方留用的生铁占很大比重，根据我国过去几年的统计，每年生铁总量百分之七十五以上用于炼钢，参考其他工业国家的统计用于炼钢的生铁占百分之七十八至八十八，一般百分之八十左右，如果按用百分之七十五生铁来炼钢计算，则第一季所产生铁完全可以满足完成第一季炼钢任务的需要，不致于因为缺铁而减产。以上情况说明了我们生铁使用分配上存在着严重的不合理现象，这可能也是调铁困难主要原因之一。为了确保炼钢生铁的需要，建议各省市非炼钢用铁可参照上列数字规定比例，不足时采取统一排队办法，保证重点，以免将供应不甚充裕的生铁用于次要用途，妨碍了钢产量的增长。又次是，发动群众大力推广先进经验并开展以技术革命为中心的高产优质社会主义竞赛运动——钢铁工业大跃进以来，广大干部与群众政治觉悟提高，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的指导下，各企业小高炉和转炉车间出现了不少先进的红旗和先进的生产经验。如贵州水城35M3高炉一九五八年每立方公尺容积每天出铁量达到一点二七吨，最高月达到一点六吨以上，每吨生铁消耗焦炭平均在一吨以下，生铁含硫量与单位成本都接近大高炉。而一般小高炉每立方公尺容积日产铁量仅零点五至零点七吨，每吨生铁焦炭消耗量在一点五至二吨，甚至在两吨以上。转炉方面也是一样，虽然一般水平很低，而上海钢铁公司第六厂转炉每吨容量每天产钢量一九五八年平均达到四十九点四吨，每吨钢锭生铁消耗一点三吨左右，合格率百分之九十五以上，一般转炉产量与这个先进单位差几倍，生铁消耗与合格率也相差很远。因此，为了迅速提高小高炉与转炉的产量和钢铁产品的质量，应进一步开展以技术革命为中心的高产优质竞赛运动，广泛发动群众推广关键性的先进经验，如小高炉方面的多嘴燃烧管式热风炉，提高冶炼强度，缩小矿石拉度，矿石分级装入等；转炉方面如碱性化铁炉，留渣操作和三排风眼等经验。更重要的是企业领导向群众交底，发动广大职工，围绕着当前生产中的关键问题，展开大鸣大放大字报大辩论，群众的智慧是无穷的，只要将问题交给群众，总是可以很快解决的。在开展技术革命的运动中应调度一切积极因素，除去行政上召开四级五级干部会议，充分听取基层干部意见外，各省市各企业还应当与各地科学技术协会合作，发动各地区金属学会会员的积极性，使专家与群众相结合，针对着生产上的重大问题，献策献计，共同为完成一千八百万吨钢而努力奋斗。
    各位委员：一九五九年是我国苦战三年有决定意义的一年，也是钢铁工业继续大跃进的一年，任务是艰巨的，但是在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，紧紧依靠群众，坚持建设社会主义的总路线，我们相信一定能完成这个光荣的任务，我作为一个钢铁冶金工作者，愿与全国几百万钢铁职工一起鼓足干劲，力争上游，为完成一千八百万吨钢的任务而献出自己的一切力量！
