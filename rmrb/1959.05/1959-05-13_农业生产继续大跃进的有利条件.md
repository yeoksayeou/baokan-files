Favorable Conditions for Continued Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
Zeng Dun

The great year of 1958 opened the road to the Great Leap Forward. The facts of that year proved that our industrial and agricultural production can advance at high speed. The increase in production was not just a few percent, but a dozen, several dozen, or even several times. This year, barring any major disasters, the increase in steel, coal, grain, and cotton can be confidently said to exceed last year's figures. It is inevitable and normal according to the laws that certain imbalances arise during the Great Leap Forward as several major indicators break through the balance. Only when major indicators break through the balance can they naturally lead other aspects of work to catch up quickly. The balance produced at this time is a balance leaped to a new foundation. Some problems or difficulties caused by certain temporary imbalances, such as transportation or raw material supply not keeping up, are problems and difficulties in the midst of victorious advance. If the supply of raw materials cannot keep up, it indicates an improvement in equipment capacity. If transportation cannot keep up, it indicates the growth of products (such as steel, iron, and raw materials for ironmaking such as ore, coking coal, and refractory materials). These problems or difficulties can be completely overcome. Because we have gone through untold hardships, overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, overthrown the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and on the basis of the historically poor and backward foundation, we have successfully completed the first five-year plan and achieved the great victory of the first year of the second five-year plan! Under such a strong and correct leadership of the Party, and with the efforts of such hardworking, brave, and intelligent people, when we pay attention to the problems in the course of our advance and take appropriate measures to solve them, we will naturally continue to leap forward!

Although the Great Leap Forward has brought us new problems, it primarily and mainly brings us favorable conditions. Giving play to the role of these favorable conditions will inevitably enable us to solve problems in work and production one by one victoriously, and make the solution of problems a huge driving force for promoting production and work. This has been proven by practice.

We have many favorable conditions for continuing to leap forward this year, but what are the most basic favorable conditions?

First is the superiority of the People's Communes. Although the rectification work of the People's Communes is still continuing, it has already shown great positive effects during the past period of rectification. A new upsurge of production has appeared in most areas of Hubei Province, the attendance rate has been greatly improved, and production efficiency has also increased significantly. If we were able to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production last year before the establishment of the People's Communes, then it can be said with certainty that we will achieve even greater harvests this year with the People's Communes. This is because the People's Communes have more advantages in leading production than the previous district and township governments. The main responsibility of the communes is to lead production, implement hierarchical management under the unified leadership and planning of the communes, which can fully exert the role of production teams and production groups, and can also exert the role of unified planning and organizing collaboration according to the principle of equivalent exchange. Moreover, the vast number of women have been liberated from housework, and the broad masses of working people have embarked on a bridge leading to the most beautiful society of mankind. All this is conducive to production.

Second, last year's Great Leap Forward created a favorable material foundation for this year. Badong County in Enshi Prefecture is a historically grain-deficient county. This year, it is able to achieve basic self-sufficiency in grain. From grain insufficiency to basic self-sufficiency, this is the harvest of the Great Leap Forward of the people of Badong last year, and it is also the material basis for achieving a greater leap forward this year. Lichuan County in this prefecture has been transformed from a poor county to a rich county due to the opening of the Enli Highway and the Wanli Highway. Xingfu People's Commune in Jianshi County is located on a high mountain more than a thousand meters above sea level. This spring, the opening of the highway will also greatly promote the development of the mountain economy there. As for the irrigation and drainage projects in various counties of our province, some of which were completed last winter and this spring, they will also play their role. As for the factories run by various counties and people's communes that implemented the combination of industry and agriculture last year, after the current rectification and consolidation work, they will certainly play a more significant role in serving agricultural production than last year.

Third, last year's Great Leap Forward gave us rich production experience. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural increase (soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, close planting, protection, tools, management) is a summary of the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward. Our province also created some advanced and feasible typical experiences of high-yield production of wheat, rice, and cotton last year. The high-yield red flags of small-area experiments last year are the pioneers of large-area high-yield this year. The wheat close planting this year is mostly in line with technical specifications and is satisfactory. Although there are some excessively dense phenomena in a small part of the experimental fields, as an experiment, it is inevitable that there are two possibilities of success and failure. Successful experience is of course valuable, and unsuccessful experience is also a positive factor in guiding production in the future. Another part of the sparsely planted wheat will, after the harvest, also make some people who do not believe in close planting convinced of close planting through comparison. With the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, and the development and enrichment of these experiences in the first four months of this year, this is an extremely favorable condition for us to complete and overfulfill the task of increasing production throughout the year. What's more, last year we not only gained rich experience in increasing production, but also gained rich experience in overcoming disasters. Everyone will not forget that Mianyang, Hanchuan, Tianmen and other places suffered unprecedented wind, rain and hail disasters last year. Last year, the drought in some areas of Hubei Province lasted for eighty days and one hundred days without rain. However, under the leadership of our Party, and with the spirit of revolutionary heroism, we not only guaranteed the people's lives, but also enabled many disaster-stricken communities to achieve a bumper harvest. This experience of overcoming disasters gives us full confidence to overcome possible disasters this year and ensure continued leap forward! We should move forward with full confidence and complete and overfulfill the grain production increase tasks assigned by the state.

Fourth, in last year's Great Leap Forward, a large number of advanced units and advanced figures emerged. The vast majority of them have been further tempered and improved in the practice of production and work in the first four months of this year. After they further develop their advantages and strengths and overcome their shortcomings, practice will further prove their advancement. They are the red flags of last year and the examples of this year. And in the first four months of this year, many new advanced units and advanced figures have emerged. Some were not discovered in the past, and some, such as rice transplanting expert Jiang Meiying, emerged in the new production upsurge. They are all positive factors and backbone forces in our continued advancement. As long as we raise these red flags higher and better, and give better play to their positive role, we will be invincible and overcome all difficulties, solve the key problems in production one by one, and successfully complete the task of continuing the Great Leap Forward this year!

Fifth, the ideological awareness of the people has been further improved. Our people are people who have been tempered by the furnace of democratic revolution and socialist revolution. Especially after experiencing the socialist education in 1957, and then experiencing the mass rectification, ideological emancipation, and studying the general line of socialist construction in 1958, and receiving the socialist and communist education in the past winter. In last year's struggle for industrial and agricultural production, in the movement of people's communes, in the movement of running iron and steel in a big way, in the work of rectifying and consolidating people's communes, and in the current movement of increasing production and practicing economy, it has been proved that the people's awareness has been unprecedentedly improved. In last year's Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of the people accumulated the experience of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. They were once people who worked hard, had soaring enthusiasm, moved mountains and overturned seas, and were clever in planning and good at innovation. In this year's new production upsurge, we have clearly seen that the broad masses of peasants continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. And because the masses summarized last year's experience, this spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work is expressed in the current production movement as being both down-to-earth and vigorous; both diligent and persevering, getting up early and working late; and daring to think, speak, and act, with a hundred plans.

Sixth, the correct leadership of the Party. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and Party Committees at all levels, the agricultural production in Hubei Province has achieved a victory in the Great Leap Forward by correctly implementing the Party Central Committee's line, policies, and policies, and has accumulated rich experience in leading rural work and agricultural production. The work style of cadres has also undergone further changes after rectifying the work of the People's Communes. They are more in-depth, practical, full of vigor, have perseverance, and are more able to share weal and woe with the masses. Our Party's organizations at all levels have transitioned from being familiar with political struggle to being familiar with production struggle. This is a leap! In this process, our Party has not only accumulated experience in comprehensively implementing the guiding principle of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and experience in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter," but also accumulated experience in giving prominence to politics. In summary, it is the accumulation of experience in implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This is one of the fundamental guarantees for continuing the Great Leap Forward this year.

Our Party will always lead the people to move forward bravely, and we will always be revolutionary optimists. Of course, there will always be favorable conditions and difficult problems in the course of advancement. And we will constantly give play to the positive role of favorable conditions and constantly overcome various difficulties, so that our cause can continue to leap forward.

    农业生产继续大跃进的有利条件
    曾惇
    伟大的1958年，开辟了大跃进的道路，这一年的事实证明：我们的工农业生产可以高速度地前进。增产的幅度不只是百分之几，而是百分之十几、百分之几十、甚至成倍。今年如无特大灾害，钢、煤、粮、棉的增产数字，可以肯定地说，是会要超过去年的。在大跃进中由于几项主要指标突破了平衡，引起某些不平衡的现象，这是必然会出现的，是合乎规律的正常现象。只有主要指标突破了平衡，才能自然而然地带领其他方面的工作，迅速跟上去，这时产生的平衡，是跃进到了一个新的基础上的平衡。由于某些暂时的不平衡所引起的某些问题或困难，例如某些交通运输或原材料供应一时跟不上等，它的性质是属于胜利前进中的问题和困难。原材料的供应跟不上，说明了设备能力的提高，交通运输跟不上，说明了产品（如钢、铁以及供炼铁用的矿石、焦煤、耐火材料等）的增长。这些问题或困难是完全可以克服的。因为我们曾经历尽了千辛万苦、克服了各种艰难险阻、推翻了国民党反动黑暗的统治，取得了民主革命与社会主义革命的伟大胜利，并且在历史上遗留下来的穷困不堪的基础上，胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，又取得了第二个五年计划第一年的伟大胜利！在这样坚强的、正确的党的领导下，在这样勤劳勇敢聪明的人民群众的努力下，当我们注意了前进中的问题，采取适当措施加以解决时，我们就会理所当然地继续跃进！
    大跃进虽然给我们带来新的问题，但它首先和主要是给我们带来了有利条件。发挥这些有利条件的作用，必然会使我们胜利地逐个解决工作和生产中的问题，并且使问题的解决成为推动生产和工作前进的巨大动力。这是已被实践所证明了的。
    我们今年继续跃进的有利条件很多，但有哪些最基本的有利条件呢？
    首先是人民公社的优越性。人民公社的整顿工作虽然还在继续进行，但它已在过去的一段整顿过程中显示了很大的积极作用。湖北省绝大部分地区出现了新的生产高潮，出勤率大为提高，生产效率也有极为显著的增长。如果说去年在建立人民公社以前，我们能够获得农业生产上空前未有的大丰收，那么可以肯定地说，有了人民公社以后的今年，会要获得更大的丰收。这是因为人民公社在领导生产上较诸过去的区、乡人民政府具有更多的优越性，公社的职责主要是领导生产，在公社的统一领导与计划下实行分级管理，既能充分发挥生产队与生产小队的作用，又能发挥统一计划和按等价交换原则组织协作的作用。而且广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来了，广大的劳动群众踏上了通向人类最美好的社会的桥梁。这都有利于生产。
    其次是去年的大跃进为今年创造了有利的物质基础。恩施专区的巴东县，是历史上一贯缺粮的县，今年能够作到口粮基本自给。从粮食不能自给到粮食基本自给，这是巴东人民去年大跃进的收获，也是今年实现更大跃进的物质基础。这个专区的利川县由于恩利公路与万利公路的通车，更由穷县转变为富县。建始县的幸福人民公社处于拔海千余公尺的高山，今年春天由于公路通车，也将大大促进那里的山区经济的发展。我省各县的排灌工程，一部分于去冬今春完工的，也将发挥它的效用。至于去年实行工农业并举，各县与各个人民公社所办的工厂，经过目前的整顿巩固工作，在为农业生产服务的方面，当然会发生较诸去年更为显著的作用。
    再次是去年的大跃进使我们获得了丰富的生产经验。农业增产的“八字宪法”（土、肥、水、种、密、保、工、管）就是去年大跃进的经验总结。我省还在去年创造了一些先进可行的小麦、水稻、棉花等高额丰产的典型经验。去年小面积试验的高产红旗，正是今年大面积丰产的先导。今年的小麦密植，绝大部分是合乎技术规格的，是使人满意的。有一小部分试验田虽有某些过密的现象，但是作为试验，自不免于有成功与不成功的两种可能，成功的经验固然是宝贵的，不成功的经验也是今后指导生产的积极因素。另一部分过稀的小麦，待到丰收以后，也会使某些不相信密植的人们，从比较中信服密植。有了去年大跃进的经验，又有今年头四个月内对这些经验的发展、充实，这就是我们全年内完成与超额完成增产任务的极其有利的条件。何况我们去年不仅获得了丰富的增产经验，还获得了丰富的战胜灾害的经验。大家不会忘记去年沔阳、汉川、天门等地遭受了历史上从未有过的风、雨、雹灾。去年湖北省有些地区的旱灾有连续到八十天、一百天不下雨的。但在我们党的领导下，发扬了革命英雄主义的精神，不仅保障了人民的生活，而且使许多受灾的社获得丰收。这种战胜灾害的经验，使我们有充分的信心克服今年可能发生的灾害，保证继续跃进！我们应该信心百倍地勇往直前，完成与超额完成国家给予的粮食增产任务。
    第四是在去年的大跃进中涌现了大批先进单位与先进人物，他们当中的绝大多数，在今年头四个月的生产与工作实践中，进一步受到了锻炼提高，在他们进一步发扬自己的优点、长处，克服自己的缺点以后，实践将进一步证明他们的先进性。他们是去年的红旗，也是今年的榜样。而在今年头四个月中又涌现了许多新的先进单位与先进人物，有些是过去没有发现的，有些如像插秧能手姜美英等，则是新的生产高潮中涌现出来的。他们都是我们继续前进中的积极因素和骨干力量。只要我们把这些红旗更高地举起来，更好地发挥他们的积极作用，我们就能战无不胜，攻无不克地逐个解决生产中的关键问题，胜利地完成今年继续大跃进的任务！
    第五是人民群众的思想觉悟进一步提高了。我们的人民是经过民主革命与社会主义革命烘炉锻炼过的人民。特别是经历了1957年的社会主义教育，又经历了1958年的全民整风、解放思想、学习社会主义建设总路线，并且受过去年冬天的社会主义、共产主义教育。在去年工农业生产斗争中，在人民公社化运动中，在大办钢铁的运动中，在整顿巩固人民公社的工作中，在当前的增产节约运动中，证明了人民群众的觉悟是空前地提高了。广大人民在去年的大跃进中，积累了苦干、实干、巧干的经验。他们曾经是艰苦奋战、干劲冲天、移山倒海，而又巧于心计、善于革新创造的人。在今年的新的生产高潮中，我们已经显著地看到广大农民群众，继续发扬着苦干、实干、巧干的精神。而由于群众性地总结了去年的经验，这种苦干、实干、巧干的精神，就在当前的生产运动中，表现为既是踏踏实实又是轰轰烈烈；既是干劲坚毅，起早贪黑；又是敢想敢说敢做，计谋百出。
    第六是党的正确领导。湖北省的农业生产在省委和各级党委的领导下，由于正确地执行党中央的路线、方针、政策，获得了大跃进的胜利，积累了领导农村工作与农业生产的丰富经验。干部作风经过整顿人民公社的工作，也有了更进一步的转变，他们更加深入踏实，富于朝气，具有坚毅性，更能与群众同劳动共甘苦。我们党的各级组织由熟悉政治斗争到熟悉生产斗争，这是一个飞跃！在这个过程中我们 党不仅积累了全面地贯彻执行多快好省的指导方针的经验和执行“八字宪法”的经验，而且积累了政治挂帅的经验。概括地说来，就是积累了执行鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的经验。这是今年继续大跃进的根本保证之一。
    我们党永远领导人民群众勇往直前，我们永远是革命乐观主义者。当然，在前进中永远会有有利条件与困难问题。而我们则会不断发挥有利条件的积极作用，不断克服各种困难，从而使我们的事业能够不断跃进。
