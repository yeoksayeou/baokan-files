Comrades,

I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I will resolutely implement them.

Now, I would like to report to the conference on the forestry production situation in the Guizhou Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture. Our Southeast Autonomous Prefecture is one of the major forest areas in Guizhou. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, forestry production has greatly developed. Especially in 1958, like other construction undertakings, our prefecture's forestry production saw a great leap forward. Inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, the vast numbers of cadres and masses, full of soaring enthusiasm, marched towards the barren mountains, proposing "to turn poor mountains into rich mountains, and to turn barren mountains into green forests." Through last year's efforts, the prefecture newly planted more than 8 million mu of sapling forests, enclosed and nurtured more than 7.5 million mu of saplings, and cultivated 11,000 mu of seedlings, equivalent to the total afforestation of the past eight years. At present, the total area of new and old forests in the prefecture has reached 25 million mu, accounting for about 70 percent of the prefecture's total area. Last year, the prefecture produced more than 660,000 cubic meters of timber, exceeding the total production of the first Five-Year Plan by more than 60 percent. At present, the total timber reserves in the prefecture are nearly 40 million cubic meters, with a harvestable volume of more than 20 million cubic meters. While rationally logging timber and actively planting and protecting forests, we also paid attention to the comprehensive utilization of timber. The prefecture has opened 274 large and small processing and manufacturing plants, including timber processing plants, cork factories, and paper mills, producing a large number of timber and forest by-products, so that timber resources can be rationally utilized.

With the rapid development of socialist construction, the country's need for timber has greatly increased. How to make trees grow quickly and become timber as early as possible to meet the needs of national construction is a major issue in forestry production. To solve this problem, last spring, we organized a large number of cadres to conduct extensive investigations and research in Jinping, Jianhe, and other counties, and found more than 40 places with "seven-year fir," "eight-year fir," "ten-year fir," and other fast-growing Chinese fir, totaling about 1.94 million mu. For example, Long Kunyuan, a member of the Bagua Commune in Jianhe County, planted nearly 800 fir trees on five mu. In just eight years, the average diameter at breast height reached 12.2 centimeters, meeting the national harvesting standard. Yang Xiuhe, a 70-year-old forester in Jinping County, planted more than 500 fir trees in the winter of 1949. In less than nine years, most of them reached the harvesting standard in the summer of 1958. We studied these fast-growing Chinese fir and found that the main reasons for the rapid growth of Chinese fir were: deep plowing of forest land, rational fertilization, rational close planting, and good seeds and strong seedlings. To implement these measures, the masses originally adopted the method of "intercropping grain in forests." This not only increased grain income, but more importantly, forest farmers could also nurture seedlings while managing crops, which helped the rapid growth of Chinese fir. Forest farmers said: "If you want the wood to grow big, you can't leave the hoe for three years." This is a good way to achieve two goals at once, and it is also a good way to combine the long-term interests of afforestation with the immediate interests of the masses.

The discovery of fast-growing Chinese fir pointed out the direction for our prefecture's forestry production and greatly boosted the confidence and determination of the vast number of cadres and masses in fighting against nature. Those who thought "afforestation is like standing on a high mountain looking at the sea, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst" and "by the time there is a return, the bones are already drumming" were educated and changed their thinking through on-site visits. The confidence of the vast forest farmers in the fast-growing and high-yielding Chinese fir has been improved. In the past, the mountain songs used to praise "eighteen-year firs" now have new content. In the past, everyone sang like this: "Plant fir trees in rows on the high slopes, creating green forests all over the mountains; after eighteen years, they grow into forests, and there is no rush for children's weddings." Now everyone sings like this: "Ten or eight-year-old children, pick up hoes to plant fir trees; wait ten years for you to cut them down, and there will be money to hold weddings."

After the method of fast-growing Chinese fir appeared, we quickly launched a fast-growing and high-yielding movement to change "eighteen-year fir" to "ten-year fir" and have achieved certain results. This spring alone, cadres and masses have carried out more than 9,400 mu of experimental forests and cultivated more than 3 million mu of high-yielding forests. At present, several rounds of weeding and topdressing have been carried out, and the seedlings are growing well. It is foreseeable that after the method of fast-growing Chinese fir is promoted throughout the prefecture, it will produce a large amount of timber in a relatively short period of time to support national construction, and at the same time, the lives of the people in the forest area will be further greatly improved.

In addition, we have done a lot of work in the forest area by implementing the policy of focusing on forestry production. First of all, we established and improved the forestry organizations at the prefecture and county levels, and established mass forest protection, fire prevention, and security organizations. We strengthened the leadership of forestry production from top to bottom, so that forestry production has been continuously developed, and the number of mountain fire incidents has decreased year by year. Counties, communes, and production teams without fire disasters in the forest area have continued to emerge. Party and government leading cadres at all levels have engaged in their own experimental forests and personally led the masses in afforestation and tree planting, which has played a great role in promoting the development of the tree planting and afforestation movement. We have also paid attention to the training of forestry cadres. In recent years, the prefecture has established one forestry college, two forestry universities "wearing hats" in complete middle schools, seventy-five forestry middle schools, and forty-four forestry primary schools, with a total of more than 6,070 students. In addition, the prefecture has also established 37 forestry scientific research institutes, with 307 staff members (including part-time old forest farmers). The establishment of these schools and research institutes will greatly promote the development of forestry production.

In short, the achievements made by the Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in forestry production and other construction undertakings are great. We deeply realize that this is the result of the united efforts of the people of all ethnic groups under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Han people and Han cadres. It is a great victory for the Party's ethnic policy. Speaking of this, we express our infinite indignation at the heinous crimes of the former Tibetan local government and the Tibetan upper-level reactionary clique colluding with imperialism and Indian expansionists to betray the motherland, undermine the unity of the motherland, and undermine the unity of all ethnic groups, and the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." This is intolerable to the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The State Council's order on dissolving the former Tibetan local government and thoroughly quelling the rebellion is entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and the Tibetan people, and we firmly support it. We fully believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people will surely be able to advance towards prosperous and happy socialism together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Let us, the people of all ethnic groups, unite closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, unite in the big family of the great motherland, muster even greater efforts, and strive to realize the national economic plan centered on the four major indicators!

    大搞杉木快速丰产
    王德安代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我把黔东南苗族、侗族自治州林业生产的情况，向大会作一汇报。我们黔东南自治州是贵州主要林区之一。解放几年来，在党的领导下，林业生产有了很大发展，特别是在一九五八年，我州的林业生产也和其他各项建设事业一样，出现了一个大跃进的局面。广大的干部和群众，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，鼓足了冲天干劲，向荒山进军，他们提出“要把穷山变富山，要把荒山变绿林”。经过去年的努力，全州新造幼苗林达八百多万亩，封山抚育幼林七百五十多万亩，育苗一万一千亩，相当于过去八年造林的总和。目前全州新老森林复盖面积共达二千五百万亩，约占全州总面积的百分之七十。去年生产的成材达六十六万多立方公尺，超过第一个五年计划生产总和的百分之六十以上。目前全州木材蓄积量将近有四千万立方公尺，可伐量也有两千多万立方公尺。在合理采伐成材和积极造林护林的同时，还注意了木材的综合利用。全州已经开办了木材加工厂、软木厂、造纸厂等大小加工制造厂二百七十四个，生产出大批木材和林副产品，使木材资源得到合理利用。
    随着社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，国家对木材的需要大量增加，如何使林木快速成长，及早成材，以适应国家建设的需要，这是林业生产上一个重大的问题。为了解决这个问题，去年春天，我们组织了大批干部，深入到锦屏、剑河等县，进行广泛的调查研究，发现四十多处“七年杉”、“八年杉”、“十年杉”等快速生长的杉木共约一百九十四万余亩。如剑河县八卦社社员龙坤元栽的五亩杉树近八百株，仅八年时间，胸高直径平均达到十二点二公分，达到了国家采伐标准；锦屏县七十岁的林农杨秀河在一九四九年冬天种植的五百多株杉木，不到九年时间，在一九五八年夏天绝大部分都达到了采伐标准。我们对这些快速生长的杉木进行了研究，发现杉木快速生长的原因主要是：深翻林地，合理施肥，合理密植，良种壮苗。为了实现这些措施，原来群众的经验是采取“林粮间作”的办法，这样作，不仅增加了粮食收入，更重要的是林农可以在管理庄稼的同时，也抚育了幼苗，有助于杉木的迅速成长。林农们说：“要想木头长得大，三年不离锄头把。”这是一个一举两得的好办法，也是把造林的长远利益和群众眼前利益结合起来的好办法。
    杉木快速生长成材的发现，给我州林业生产指出了前进的方向，大大地鼓舞了广大干部和群众向大自然斗争的信心和决心，那些认为
  “造林是站在高山望大海，远水不能解近渴”，
  “等到有收益，骨头早打鼓”的人，通过现场参观，受到了教育，思想改变了。广大林农对杉木快速丰产的信心提高了。过去群众用来赞扬“十八杉”的山歌，现在又有了新的内容。过去大家这样唱：“高坡栽杉一行行，造成绿林满山岗；十八年后长成林，儿女婚嫁不慌忙。”现在大家这样唱：“十岁八岁小娃娃，拿起锄头去栽杉；等到十年你去砍，要办喜事有钱花。”
    杉木快速生长成材的办法出现后，我们很快就掀起了改“十八杉”为“十年杉”的快速丰产运动，并已取得一定成绩。仅今年春季，干部和群众就搞了试验林九千四百多亩，培养了丰产林三百多万亩，目前已进行了几次?修追肥，树苗生长情况良好。可以预料，杉木快速生长成材的办法，在全州推广后，将在较短的时间内，生产出大量的木材，支援国家建设，同时林区人民的生活将进一步大大改善。
    此外，我们在林区执行了以林业生产为主的方针，还做了不少工作。首先建立和健全州、县两级林业组织机构，并建立了群众性的护林防火保卫组织。从上而下的加强了林业生产的领导。使林业生产得到不断发展，山林火灾事件逐年减少，林区无火灾县、社、生产队不断出现。各级党政领导干部都搞了自己的试验林，并且亲自带领群众造林植树，这对推动植树造林运动的开展起到很大作用。我们还注意了培养和训练林业干部的工作。几年来全州办林学院一所，在完全中学“戴帽子”的林业大学二所；林业中学七十五所；林业小学四十四所，共有学生达六千零七十多人。此外，全州还建立了林业科学研究所三十七个，有工作人员三百零七人（包括不脱产部分老林农在内）。这些学校、研究所的建立，将会大大地推动林业生产的发展。
    总之，黔东南苗族、侗族自治州的林业生产和其他各项建设事业所取得的成就是很大的。我们深深的体会到这是在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在汉族人民和汉族干部的帮助下，各族人民团结一致共同努力的结果。是党的民族政策的伟大胜利。说到这里，我们对原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义者背叛祖国、破坏祖国的统一、破坏各民族团结的滔天罪行和所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”表示无限的愤慨，这是全国各族人民所不能容忍的。国务院关于解散原西藏地方政府和彻底平息叛乱的命令，是完全符合全国各族人民和西藏人民的根本利益的，我们坚决拥护。我们完全相信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，西藏人民一定能够和全国各族人民一道向繁荣幸福的社会主义迈进。让我们各族人民紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，团结在伟大祖国的大家庭里，鼓足更大的干劲，为实现以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗！
