Ode to An Yemin

I want to sing a song, praising An Yemin,
Every word used seems insufficient,
He is brighter than the sun and moon.
Hundreds of miles of coastal defense line,
Laid out with ten thousand cannons,
Ten million warriors guarding the cannons,
Ten thousand cannons shake Jinmen.
An Yemin is a marksman,
Sees clearly through cloud cover,
Only because the Party's teachings enlightened him,
Loves deeply, hates intensely!
Enemy cannons fire fiercely,
A person stands tall in the flames,
Forgetting life and death to save the cannon,
—This is An Yemin!
The cannon is intact, but his body is burning,
Ignoring the pain, he bombards the enemy阵,
Red light shines brightly on the earth,
—This is An Yemin!
The hero smiles even in death,
Thinking of the cannon, his whole body is strong,
A golden phoenix rises from the fire,
—This is An Yemin!
The sea breeze rolls over his black ribbon,
The sea water washes over his blue cape;
He goes home with his head held high, the world is small,
A round red sun, a heart of gold.
The hero carries the sun and moon on his shoulders,
He is ten times brighter than the stars;
The hero swallows mountains and seas,
Mountains and seas play a mournful tune for him.
Yellow rapeseed flowers, green flowing water,
Pale blue sky dotted with white clouds,
The motherland is immersed in the fragrance of flowers,
An Yemin will always be an immortal man!

    颂安业民
  　李瑛我要唱支歌，礼赞安业民，字眼用尽没分量，他比日月明。几百里的海防线，摆下炮万尊，千万勇士守大炮，万炮震金门。安业民是个瞄准手，云遮雾罩看得真，只因党的教导觉悟高，爱得切，恨得深！敌炮打来战斗紧，火光里挺胸站出一个人，忘却生死救火炮，——这就是安业民！炮完好，可火烧身，不顾伤痛轰敌阵，红光闪闪照大地，——这就是安业民！英雄至死犹在笑，想起大炮混身劲，火中腾起金凤凰，——这就是安业民！海风卷过他的黑飘带，海水洗过他的蓝披肩；昂首归去天地小，一轮红日一颗心。英雄肩挑日和月，他比众星亮十分；英雄气吞山和海，山海为他奏哀音。黄菜花、绿流水，淡淡的蓝天飘白云，祖国浸在花香里，安业民永远是个不死的人！
