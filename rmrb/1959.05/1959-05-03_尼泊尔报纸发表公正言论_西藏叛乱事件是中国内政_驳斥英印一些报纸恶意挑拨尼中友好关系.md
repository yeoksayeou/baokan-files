Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from Kathmandu: Several newspapers published in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, have recently published editorials demanding non-interference in China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and refuting the distorted propaganda by some British and Indian newspapers to sow discord in the friendly relations between Nepal and China.

    The "News" published an editorial on April 21 criticizing the British "Sunday Times" and the Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika," saying that these newspapers spread sensational news about Nepal's so-called attitude towards the Tibetan rebellion, and they wanted to portray the King of Nepal in their own colors.

    The newspaper also said, "They have ignored the background of Nepal's diplomatic relations with China. We believe that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair," and "There is no reason to doubt the long-standing traditional friendship between Nepal and China."

    It pointed out that the ulterior propaganda in British and Indian newspapers "is merely a mark of selfishness," and this propaganda is an attempt to "blackmail Nepal into joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

    The "Filimgo Daily" (Reporter) also emphasized in an editorial on April 22 that the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair. It questioned the newspapers that were sowing discord between Nepal and China, saying: "What benefit can be gained from distorting the facts and creating unnecessary rumors?" The newspaper said that such news only pollutes the air and all such nonsense should be stopped immediately.

    The "Society Daily" also published an editorial on April 22 saying, "Nepal adheres to its foreign policy, and these selfish foreign journalists are only exposing themselves as a bunch of fools in front of the whole world."

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch: According to a report from Kathmandu on the 28th by the Indian Press Trust, the Nepalese government on April 28 once again denied a news item carried in the newspapers: that some Chinese had entered Nepal while pursuing Tibetans fleeing Tibet. This is the third time that Nepalese officials have denied this rumor.

    尼泊尔报纸发表公正言论
    西藏叛乱事件是中国内政
    驳斥英印一些报纸恶意挑拨尼中友好关系
    新华社2日讯　加德满都消息：在尼泊尔首都加德满都出版的好几家报纸最近纷纷发表社论，要求不干涉中国平定西藏叛乱的事，并且驳斥了英国和印度一些报纸为了挑拨尼泊尔同中国的友好关系而进行的歪曲宣传。
    “新闻报”在4月21日发表社论批评英国“星期日泰晤士报”和印度“甘露市场报”说，这些报纸散播了耸人听闻的关于所谓尼泊尔对西藏叛乱的态度的新闻，它们想用自己的色彩来描写尼泊尔国王。
    这家报纸还说，“它们忽略了尼泊尔同中国外交关系的背景。我们认为，西藏问题是中国内政”，“没有理由来怀疑尼泊尔同中国之间悠久的传统友谊”。
    它指出，英国和印度报刊上的别有用心的宣传“仅仅是一种自私自利的标记”，这种宣传是企图“讹诈尼泊尔参加东南亚条约组织”。
    “菲林果报”（记者）在4月22日的一篇社论中也强调指出西藏叛乱是中国的内政。它责问这些挑拨尼、中关系的报纸道：“从歪曲事实和制造不必要的谣言当中能够得到什么好处呢？”这家报纸说，这类新闻只会使空气污浊，应当立即停止所有这类胡扯。
    “社会报”在4月22日也发表社论说，“尼泊尔坚守它的外交政策，这类自私的外国记者们只是在全世界面前暴露了他们自己是一群傻瓜”。
    新华社30日讯　据印度报业托辣斯28日自加德满都报道，尼泊尔政府4月28日再一次否认了报纸上所载的下面这样一条消息：有一些中国人在追击逃出西藏的西藏人的时候进入了尼泊尔。这是尼泊尔官方第三次否认这个谣言。
