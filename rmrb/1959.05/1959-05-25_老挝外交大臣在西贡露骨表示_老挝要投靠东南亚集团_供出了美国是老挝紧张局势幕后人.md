Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: Saigon News: Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya blatantly stated to reporters in Saigon on May 21st that the Lao government, in the event of so-called "foreign aggression," would "naturally seek help not only from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization but also from any other international organization or any more powerful anti-communist country."

The Lao Foreign Minister's blatant disregard for the Geneva Accords and expression of Laos' desire to rely on the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization clearly exposes that the mastermind behind the Lao government's recent attacks on former Lao combat troops and persecution of the Lao Patriotic Party is none other than U.S. imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization under its control. In fact, after Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone announced on February 11th that Laos was not bound by the Geneva Accords and opposed the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos, U.S. State Department officials immediately expressed support and believed that the United States was free to establish a military mission in Laos. U.S. news agencies also openly promoted the possibility of Laos becoming a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

In his remarks, Panya once again stated the Lao government's "firm position" in opposing the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos.

According to him, the Lao government believes that there is no need to take this action because hostilities in Laos have completely ceased. However, as he said this, the Lao Royal Government was taking actions to launch a civil war and thereby undermine peace in Indochina.

    老挝外交大臣在西贡露骨表示
    老挝要投靠东南亚集团
    供出了美国是老挝紧张局势幕后人
    新华社23日讯　西贡消息：老挝王国外交大臣坎番·班雅21日在西贡对记者发表谈话时露骨地说，老挝政府在他所谓的“发生外国侵略时”，“自然不仅要寻求东南亚条约组织而且还要寻求其他任何国际组织或者任何较强大的反共国家的帮助”。
    老挝外交大臣公然不顾日内瓦协议、表示老挝要投靠东南亚条约组织的这番谈话，明白地暴露出，老挝政府最近进攻前寮国战斗部队和迫害老挝爱国党，其幕后指使人正是美帝国主义及其控制下的东南亚条约组织。事实上，在2月11日老挝首相培·萨纳尼空宣布老挝不受日内瓦协议的约束并且反对老挝国际委员会恢复活动以后，美国国务院官员就立即表示支持，并且认为美国可以自由地在老挝设立军事使团，美国的通讯社还公开宣传老挝有可能成为东南亚条约组织的成员国。
    班雅在谈话中又一次表示，老挝政府坚持反对恢复老挝国际委员会活动的“坚定立场”。
    据他说，老挝政府认为没有必要采取这个行动，因为敌对行动在老挝已经完全停止了。然而，当他这样说的时候，老挝王国政府正在采取发动内战进而破坏印度支那和平的行动。
