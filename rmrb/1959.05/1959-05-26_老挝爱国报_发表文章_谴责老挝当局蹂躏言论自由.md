Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 24th: Vientiane dispatch: The "Laos Patriotic Newspaper," the organ of the Lao Patriotic Party, published an article on April 4th condemning the Lao authorities' persecution of the newspaper.

The article stated: On February 13th of this year, the Vientiane court prosecutor, acting on instructions from the Lao Ministry of Justice, filed a lawsuit against Sisana Sisane, the editor-in-chief of the "Laos Patriotic Newspaper," on the pretext that the newspaper published Prince Souphanouvong's letter to the International Commission for Laos on January 11th and his letter to the Prime Minister of the Lao government, Phoui Sananikone, on January 27th. In the two months prior to this, two other lawsuits were filed against the editor-in-chief of the "Laos Patriotic Newspaper," one on the pretext that the newspaper published an article that supposedly "disturbed the people," and the other for publishing an article that was supposedly "without evidence."

The "Laos Patriotic Newspaper" article stated that the lawsuit against editor-in-chief Sisane was the first litigation case to occur in the Lao press. Regarding Prince Souphanouvong's letter to the International Commission for Laos, the court presented Sisane with twelve questions; regarding the letter to the Prime Minister of the Lao government, the court questioned what evidence there was in the letter mentioning the murder of Tiao Nithone. Sisane has already given specific answers to these questions. If necessary, the "Laos Patriotic Newspaper" can publish these answers in the next issue.

The article stated, "We believe that Sisane's answers to the court fully explain the reasons why Prince Souphanouvong's letters could be published in the newspaper, and that these letters are based on factual evidence and will not disturb the people. On the contrary, those who create incidents of discrimination, retaliation, arrest, torture, and persecution are the disturbers of the people's hearts. Prince Souphanouvong's letters do not violate the law, and therefore, the 'Laos Patriotic Newspaper' believes that the lawsuit against editor-in-chief Sisane is unfounded." The article said that the parties involved in the court and the Ministry of Interior should have conducted on-site investigations because this is a major issue related to national unity and harmony; and fulfilling the agreement on the unification of Laos is also fulfilling a part of the Geneva Accords.

The article said, "We believe that the lawsuit against the editor-in-chief of the 'Laos Patriotic Newspaper' is a conspiracy to persecute the 'Laos Patriotic Newspaper,' is a trampling on the right to freedom of speech, and violates the Lao people's desire for Laos to have a genuine democratic system." The article concluded: "We condemn to domestic and foreign public opinion all acts that threaten and persecute newspapers and magazines. At the same time, we hope that the government, the National Assembly, and the court will withdraw the lawsuit against the editor-in-chief of the 'Laos Patriotic Newspaper.'"

### “老挝爱国报”发表文章  谴责老挝当局蹂躏言论自由

    “老挝爱国报”发表文章
    谴责老挝当局蹂躏言论自由
    新华社河内24日电  万象消息：老挝爱国党机关报“老挝爱国报”4月4日发表文章谴责老挝当局迫害这家报纸的行为。
    文章说：今年2月13日，万象法院检察官执行老挝司法部的指示，对“老挝爱国报”主编西萨纳·西山提出起诉，借口是这家报纸刊登了苏发努冯亲王今年1月11日寄给老挝国际委员会和1月27日寄给老挝政府首相培·萨纳尼空的信。在这以前的两个月内，还对“老挝爱国报”主编提出了两次起诉，一次的借口是这家报纸刊登了所谓“扰乱人心”的文章，另一次是刊登了所谓“没有凭据”的文章。
    “老挝爱国报”的文章说，对“老挝爱国报”主编西山提出起诉是老挝新闻界第一次发生的诉讼事件。关于苏发努冯亲王寄给老挝国际委员会的信，法院向西山提出了十二项质问；关于寄给老挝政府首相的信，法院质问说，信中提到迪敦被杀害有甚么凭据。对于这些质问，西山都已经作了具体的答复。如果需要的话，“老挝爱国报”下一期可以刊登这些答复。
    文章说，我们认为，西山向法院所作的答复，充分说明了苏发努冯亲王的信可以在报纸上刊登的理由，而这些信就是因为有真凭实据，并不会扰乱人心。相反地，制造歧视、报复、逮捕、拷打、迫害等事件的人，才是人心的扰乱者。苏发努冯亲王的信并没有违反法律的地方，因此，“老挝爱国报”认为，对主编西山提出起诉是没有根据的。文章说，本来，法院和内政部当事者应当去进行现场调查，因为这是关系到民族团结和和睦的大问题；而履行关于老挝统一的协议，也就是履行日内瓦协议的一个部分。
  文章说，我们认为，对“老挝
  爱国报”主编提出起诉是迫害“老挝爱国报”的一种阴谋，是蹂躏了言论自由权、违背了老挝人民希望老挝有真正的民主制度的愿望。文章最后说：“我们向国内外舆论谴责一切威胁、迫害报刊的行为。同时希望政府、国会和法院撤消对‘老挝爱国报’主编的起诉。”
