Half-Month International Review
(April 16th to April 30th)

    Developments on the Eve of the Geneva Conference

    The date of the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers Conference is approaching day by day. Since the Geneva Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers Conference in the autumn of 1955, this is the first time that Eastern and Western countries have held a ministerial-level meeting to resolve major international issues. Because this conference will discuss the German question, which is of great significance to the current international situation, it has naturally attracted close attention from public opinion in various countries around the world.

    The outcome of the Geneva Conference will depend entirely on the positions and attitudes of the Eastern and Western representatives on the German question. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and observe the attitudes of both sides in advance on the eve of the meeting.

    The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the People's Republic of China held in Warsaw from April 27th to 28th clearly stated the attitude of the socialist countries towards the upcoming Geneva Conference in the meeting's communique. Taking into account the deep aspirations of the people of all countries and the maturity of the current moment, the foreign ministers of the countries participating in the meeting unanimously hoped that the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference would be able to reach a consensus agreement on the two most acute and important issues at present—the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of ending the occupation regime in West Berlin. The communique called on all countries that will participate in the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference to make efforts to ensure the success of this conference, and declared that the governments of the socialist countries will do their best to ensure the success of these talks. In view of some Western countries' plans, recently revealed by Western news agencies, that are detrimental to the progress of the Geneva Conference, the meeting's communique specifically emphasized that attempts to entangle the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue with the issue of German reunification and European security can only be regarded as deliberately creating obstacles to the Geneva Conference.

    The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Warsaw Treaty member states and China is another contribution to easing international tensions. It shows the consistent sincerity of the socialist camp countries in striving for a peaceful resolution of the German question, and their unity and close cooperation in this struggle.

    But on the other hand, Western countries are not moving in the direction of seeking an agreement for the Geneva Conference. After the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in early April and the Western Four Foreign Ministers meeting at the end of the month, it can now be generally affirmed that Western countries will propose a "package" plan at the Geneva Conference as a counter-proposal to the Soviet proposal. And the so-called "package" is to lump together the issues of a peace treaty with Germany, the Berlin issue, the "freezing" of armaments in Central Europe, and other issues with the issue of German reunification. In the words of the London "Times," "all issues at the conference will either be resolved entirely or not resolved at all." Since the authority and time of the Foreign Ministers Conference do not permit the discussion and handling of such complex issues, it is very likely to result in a "complete lack of resolution," which is precisely the original intention of Western countries. Therefore, it is not difficult for people to understand why the British "Daily Telegraph" issued such a prediction when commenting on the Western Foreign Ministers Conference held at the end of April: "The possibility of any significant change in the Western attitude is very slim. Under these circumstances, the Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Geneva on May 11 will soon reach a deadlock."

    In addition, it is worth noting that some American officials issued ominous and even bellicose remarks on the eve of the meeting. US Vice President Nixon recently stated that "the United States has little hope of reaching an agreement with Russia at the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference and the possible summit meeting." And US Secretary of Defense McElroy simply said that the only way to negotiate with the East is "from a position of strength." At the same time, the United States also took provocative actions, dispatching aircraft to fly at high altitudes of over 7,000 meters in the Berlin Air Corridor; the United States also stepped up the establishment of missile bases on the territory of some Western European countries, and stepped up the equipment of the West German army with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. The purpose of these activities is obviously to poison the international atmosphere on the eve of the Geneva Conference and make the conference face a fait accompli from the beginning.

    There is no doubt that the Geneva Conference will be a serious struggle between East and West.

    America's New Conspiracy Against Latin America

    While attempting to create obstacles to the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States has also recently been colluding with reactionaries in certain Latin American countries to intensify conspiracies aimed at suppressing the national independence movement in Latin America.

    Subverting the Cuban provisional government and extinguishing the flames of the Cuban revolution is the focus of US imperialism's conspiracy against Latin America. In order to achieve this despicable goal, in addition to continuing to carry out slanderous propaganda against Cuba and using the method of reducing sugar imports to create economic difficulties for Cuba, US imperialism is also intensifying the creation of tension in the Caribbean Sea, fabricating so-called Cuban "invasions" of other Latin American countries, attempting to cause conflicts between them, and then using the "Organization of American States" controlled by the United States to intervene in Cuba.

    According to a statement issued by the Cuban People's Socialist Party (Communist Party) on April 26, the leader of a group of volunteers who were recently intercepted by the Cuban government and intended to go to Nicaragua to carry out a revolution was an American special agent. His conspiracy was to inform the Nicaraguan authorities of their landing point in advance, so that they would be caught in one fell swoop upon landing, thereby allowing the Nicaraguan authorities to accuse Cuba of "aggression," and under the coordination of the conspirators organized by the US special agent Knight in Cuba, who is specifically responsible for subverting Cuba, organize an international police action to carry out armed intervention in Cuba. After the Cuban "invasion" of Nicaragua failed, US imperialism and the Panamanian authorities created an excuse for interfering in and invading Cuba around the incident of a group of armed personnel landing in Panama. Due to the recent landing of dozens of armed personnel, Panamanian President de la Guardia recklessly claimed that these were "foreign mercenaries" who had invaded Panama from Cuba. And the United States hurriedly shipped arms to Panama and sent military aircraft to patrol the Panamanian coast. Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Guatemala also expressed their willingness to provide assistance to Panama. The US State Department also instructed the "Organization of American States" to organize a fact-finding committee to conduct on-site investigations in a village occupied by the landing personnel in Panama. However, all of this was in vain. On May 1, the armed personnel surrendered unconditionally. The investigation communique issued by the "Organization of American States" investigation committee also believed that "the evidence in the hands of the investigation committee is not enough to prove that the invaders took action with the consent of any government." In this way, the United States' conspiracy to interfere in Cuba under the pretext of the Panama incident failed once again.

    US imperialism is also instigating anti-Soviet and anti-communist movements in some Latin American countries to suppress nationalist movements and trade union movements, and to exacerbate international tensions. Argentina promulgated a decree on April 27 banning the activities of the Communist Party. Uruguay, Argentina, and Mexico took unfriendly actions against personnel from the Soviet and Romanian embassies. Brazilian customs authorities unreasonably detained books imported from Czechoslovakia. US imperialism's anti-Soviet and anti-communist conspiracy has been strongly condemned by fair-minded public opinion in Latin American countries. The Uruguayan "Adelante" pointed out that the reactionary anti-communist propaganda movement is an attempt to add fuel to the flames of the "cold war" ignited by those who exacerbate international tensions. The Brazilian weekly "Nova Diretriz" pointed out that the US State Department's plan is "to create tension between Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, and the Soviet Union," and that "US imperialism is afraid that some Latin American countries will re-establish diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union."

    Recent Developments in the African Anti-Colonial Struggle

    In these days, the struggle of the African people for national independence and freedom seems to have calmed down compared to the past. In the regions where the struggle has been most intense this year—the Belgian Congo and Nyasaland—large-scale mass struggles in the cities have temporarily eased under the cruel suppression of the colonial authorities. However, the struggle has not stagnated, but has developed in a deeper and more lasting direction. The nationalist organization leading the people of Nyasaland in the anti-colonial struggle—the African National Congress—has quickly gone underground with the full support of the people, and continues to lead the people of Nyasaland in the struggle against British colonial rule and racial discrimination. Now, in the jungles and mountains of Nyasaland, in the vast remote areas, the struggle continues to develop. Although the anti-colonial struggle of the people of the Belgian Congo has been temporarily suppressed due to the barbaric military means adopted by the Belgian colonial authorities, the spark of the Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule has not been extinguished and new struggles may break out at any time.

    In Uganda, East Africa, there have been a series of recent anti-colonial demonstrations involving 3,000 Africans, protesting the colonial authorities' court's unreasonable summons of Ugandan nationalist movement leaders Kamya and Kiberu. The struggle of the people of Kenya to demand that the British colonial authorities amend the constitution and abolish emergency regulations is also continuing.

    On April 15, people all over the world gathered to commemorate the great holiday of the African people, "African Freedom Day." On this day, from Conakry to Addis Ababa, from Tunis to Johannesburg, people in almost every part of Africa held mass rallies and parades. They angrily condemned the enslavement and plunder of the African people by colonial countries, demanding immediate independence and freedom. Leaders of nine African countries, including Algeria, Zanzibar, and Kenya, held a meeting in Cairo, strongly condemning colonialism and demanding that "colonialists who now rule Africa entirely by force immediately hand over power and withdraw from the African continent." In order to support the struggle of the people of Central Africa, from April 15 to 17, the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference held an emergency meeting in Conakry, calling on Africans, Asians, and all religious leaders around the world to condemn "the outrageous brutality of the authorities of the Central African Federation (especially Nyasaland) and the Belgian Congo."

    Seeing that armed suppression cannot subdue the African people, the colonialists viciously use conspiracies. After arresting the leaders of the Congolese nationalist organization "Abako," such as Kasavubu, the Belgian colonial authorities immediately sent them to Belgium and forced them to publish so-called "statements" of "praise" for the colonialists, demanding that the Congolese people "remain calm and forget the past." The British colonial authorities in Tanganyika recently announced the reorganization of the government, agreeing to allow a small number of Africans to participate in the government. French Prime Minister Debré recently discussed the African issue with British Prime Minister Macmillan in London. According to Western news agencies, the agreement reached by the two sides was to use so-called "aid" and "education" methods to "win over" the African people. All of this proves that imperialism is using new methods to divide the internal unity of the African people and weaken the surging anti-imperialist movement. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the African people.

　　半月国际述评
　　（四月十六日到四月三十日）
    日内瓦会议前夕的动向
    日内瓦东西方外长会议的日期已经一天天地逼近了。自从1955年秋天日内瓦苏、美、英、法四国外长会议以来，东西方国家之间为了解决重大的国际问题而举行部长级会议，这还是第一次。由于这次会议将讨论对当前国际局势具有重大意义的德国问题，它就理所当然地引起世界各国舆论的密切注意。
    日内瓦会议的结果如何，将完全取决于东西方与会代表在德国问题上的立场和态度。因此，在会议前夕对双方的态度作一番事先的了解和观察是很必要的。
    4月27日到28日在华沙举行的华沙条约缔约国和中华人民共和国的外交部长会议，在会议的公报中清楚地表明了社会主义国家对于行将到来的日内瓦会议的态度。考虑到各国人民的深切愿望和目前时机的成熟，参加这次会议的各国外长们一致希望，日内瓦外长会议将能够就目前两个最尖锐、最重要的问题——缔结对德和约问题和结束西柏林占领制度问题达成一致的协议。公报要求所有将要参加日内瓦外长会议的国家都为这一会议的成功作出努力，并且声明，社会主义国家的政府将竭尽全力来保证这次会谈的成功。鉴于最近西方通讯社所透露的西方国家的一些不利于日内瓦会议进展的打算，会议公报特别强调指出，那种企图把对德和约问题和西柏林问题同德国统一问题以及欧洲安全问题纠缠起来的做法，只能认为是给日内瓦会议故意制造障碍。
    华沙条约缔约国和中国外长会议是对于缓和国际紧张局势的又一次贡献。它表明社会主义阵营各国对于争取德国问题和平解决的始终一贯的诚意，和它们在这个斗争中的团结一致与密切合作。
    但在另一方面，西方国家却并不是朝着为日内瓦会议谋求协议的方向前进的。经过4月初的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议和月底的西方四国外长会议，现在已大体上可以肯定，西方国家将在日内瓦会议上提出一个“一揽子”计划来作为针对苏联建议的反建议。而所谓“一揽子”也者，就是把对德和约问题、柏林问题、中欧“冻结”军备问题等同德国统一问题一古脑儿地串在一起。用伦敦“泰晤士报”的话来说，“所有的问题在会议上要么全部解决，要么就全部得不到解决”。既然外长会议的权限和时间不许可讨论和处理这么复杂的问题，那就很可能造成“全部得不到解决”的结果，而这正是西方国家的本来目的。因此人们就不难理解，为什么英国“每日电讯报”在评论4月底举行的西方外长会议时就发出了这样的预言：“西方态度发生任何意义重大的改变的可能性是非常淡薄的。在这种形势下，5月11日在日内瓦举行的外长会议很快就会陷入僵局。”
    另外，值得人们注意的是，美国的一些官方人士在会议前夕发出不祥的甚至好战的言论。美国副总统尼克松不久前竟然表示：“美国没有什么希望能在即将举行的外长会议和可能举行的最高级会议上同俄国达成协议”。而美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊则干脆说：同东方谈判的唯一方法是“从实力地位出发”。同时，美国还采取挑衅行动，派遣飞机在柏林空中走廊作七千公尺以上的高空飞行；美国还加紧在一些西欧国家领土上建立导弹基地，并且加紧用核武器和火箭武器装备西德军队。这些活动的目的显然是要毒化日内瓦会议前夕的国际气氛，并使会议一开始时就面临既成事实。
    毫无疑问，日内瓦会议将是东西方之间的一场严重的斗争。
    美国对拉丁美洲的新阴谋
    在企图为行将到来的日内瓦外长会议制造障碍的同时，美国最近还正在勾结某些拉丁美洲国家的反动派，加紧进行目的在于镇压拉丁美洲民族独立运动的阴谋活动。
    颠复古巴临时政府，扑灭古巴革命火焰，是美帝国主义对拉丁美洲阴谋活动的中心。为了达到这个卑鄙的目的，美帝国主义除了继续对古巴进行诽谤宣传和用减少食糖进口的办法给古巴制造经济困难以外，还加紧在加勒比海制造紧张局势，捏造所谓古巴“入侵”其他拉丁美洲国家的事件，企图使它们之间发生冲突，然后再利用美国控制的“美洲国家组织”对古巴进行干涉。
    据古巴人民社会党（共产党）在4月26日发表的一项声明揭露，最近被古巴政府截住的一群打算去尼加拉瓜进行革命的志愿人员的领袖，是一个美国特务。他的阴谋是事前把他们登陆的地点告诉尼加拉瓜当局，以便在登陆时被一网打尽，从而使尼加拉瓜当局控告古巴“侵略”，并由专门负责颠复古巴活动的美国特务奈特上校在古巴组织的阴谋分子的配合下，组织一次国际警察行动，对古巴进行武装干涉。在古巴“入侵”尼加拉瓜事件流产后，美帝国主义和巴拿马当局又围绕着有一批武装人员在巴拿马登陆事件，制造干涉和侵略古巴的借口。由于最近几十个武装人员的登陆，巴拿马总统德古阿迪亚就胡说什么这是“外国雇佣兵”从古巴侵入巴拿马的。而美国也就急忙地向巴拿马运送军火，并派军用飞机在巴拿马海岸巡逻。哥斯达黎加、尼加拉瓜和危地马拉也表示愿意向巴拿马提供援助。美国国务院还授意“美洲国家组织”组织一个调查委员会到巴拿马登陆人员所占领的一个村庄中实地调查。但是，这一切都是枉费心机。5月1日，这批武装人员无条件投降了。“美洲国家组织”调查委员会发表的调查公报也认为“调查委员会所掌握的证据还不足以证明入侵者是在任何政府的同意之下采取的行动”。这样，美国借口巴拿马事件干涉古巴的阴谋又一次破产了。
    美帝国主义还在一些拉丁美洲国家中策动反苏反共运动，以镇压民族主义运动和工会运动，并加剧国际紧张局势。阿根廷在4月27日颁布一项禁止共产党活动的法令。乌拉圭、阿根廷、墨西哥对苏联和罗马尼亚大使馆人员采取了不友好的行为。巴西海关当局无理扣留从捷克斯洛伐克进口的书籍。美帝国主义这种反苏反共的阴谋，已遭到拉丁美洲国家公正舆论的强烈谴责。乌拉圭“前进报”指出，反动的反共宣传运动是企图向那些加剧国际紧张局势的拥护者所煽起的“冷战”火焰上加油。巴西“新方针”周刊指出，美国国务院的计划是“为了在乌拉圭、阿根廷、墨西哥和苏联之间造成紧张关系”，“美帝国主义害怕拉丁美洲一些国家同苏联重新建立外交和贸易关系”。
    非洲反殖民主义斗争近况
    在这些日子里，非洲人民争取民族独立自由的斗争从表面上看似乎已较前平静。今年以来斗争最激烈的地区——比属刚果和尼亚萨兰，在殖民当局的残酷镇压下，城市中大规模的群众斗争已暂时缓和下来。但是，斗争并未停滞，却朝着更深入和持久的方向发展。领导尼亚萨兰人民进行反殖民主义斗争的民族主义组织——非洲人国民大会，在人民的全力支持下，已迅速转入地下进行活动，并且继续领导着尼亚萨兰人民进行反对英国殖民统治和种族歧视的斗争。现在，在尼亚萨兰的丛林和山区，在辽阔的边远地带，斗争还在继续发展。比属刚果人民的反殖民主义斗争尽管由于比利时殖民当局采取了野蛮的军事手段而被暂时地镇压下去，但是刚果人民反抗殖民统治斗争的火种仍然没有熄灭，随时都可能爆发新的斗争。
    在东非乌干达，最近接连发生有三千非洲人参加的反殖民主义大示威，抗议殖民当局的法院无理传讯乌干达民族主义运动领袖卡米亚和基贝鲁。怯尼亚人民要求英国殖民当局修改宪法和废除紧急条例的斗争也在继续中。
    4月15日，全世界人民纷纷集会纪念了非洲人民伟大的节日“非洲自由日”。在这一天，从科纳克里到亚的斯亚贝巴，从突尼斯到约翰内斯堡，几乎非洲各个地方的人民都举行了群众集会和游行。他们愤怒地谴责殖民国家对非洲人民的奴役和掠夺，要求立即获得独立和自由。阿尔及利亚、桑给巴尔、怯尼亚等九个非洲国家的领导人在开罗举行了会议，对殖民主义进行了强烈的谴责，并且要求“现在完全依靠武力统治非洲的殖民主义者立即交出权力和退出非洲大陆”。为了支援中非人民的斗争，从4月15日至17日，全非人民大会总务委员会在科纳克里举行了紧急会议，呼吁非洲人、亚洲人和全世界所有的宗教界领袖谴责“中非联邦（特别是尼亚萨兰）和比属刚果当局的放肆的残暴行为”。
    殖民主义者眼看武装镇压不能使非洲人民屈服，于是就恶毒地使用阴谋诡计。比利时殖民当局在把刚果民族主义组织“阿巴科”的领袖卡萨武布等逮捕后，立即解往比利时，并强迫他们发表了对殖民主义者“歌功颂德”的所谓“声明”，竟要刚果人民“保持平静，忘掉过去”。坦噶尼喀英国殖民当局最近也宣布改组政府，同意让少数非洲人参加政权。法国总理德勃雷最近还在伦敦和英国首相麦克米伦专门讨论了非洲问题，据西方通讯社透露，双方达成的协议是用所谓“援助”和“教育”的方法，来“拉拢”非洲人民。凡此种种，证明帝国主义正在使用新的手法，以分化非洲人民内部的团结和削弱蓬勃高涨中的反帝运动。这就不能不引起非洲人民的严重警惕。
