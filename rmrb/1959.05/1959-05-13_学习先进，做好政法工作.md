Short Commentary

    The National Congress of Advanced Workers in Public Security, Procuratorate and Justice, with more than 2,300 representatives, has opened. This is a review conference of the great leap forward in political and legal work, a gathering of heroes in the political and legal front, and an exchange conference of advanced experiences in political and legal work.
    Under the situation of the nationwide great leap forward, political and legal work has also made great leaps forward since last year. Various civil and criminal cases have decreased significantly, labor reform prisoners have been rapidly reformed, and social order has been unprecedentedly stable. This all shows that the great leap forward in political and legal work has achieved brilliant results. Of course, the achievement of these results is inseparable from the gradual improvement of people's awareness, the strong leadership of the Party over political and legal work, and the joint efforts of all political and legal workers. However, undoubtedly, the tens of thousands of advanced workers who have emerged in the political and legal front in the past year are the leaders in creating these achievements and a powerful factor in promoting the continued great leap forward in political and legal work. Therefore, these advanced workers should be respected and commended by the people, and are particularly worthy of study by all political and legal workers.
    What should we learn from them? First, learn from their heroic actions and self-sacrificing spirit in defending the security of the motherland and protecting the lives and property of the people at all costs in the struggle against the enemy (spies, counter-revolutionaries, etc.). Learn from their noble communist character and spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, being devoted to their duties, being considerate to the people in ordinary times, helping the old and the young, finding relatives and friends, and standing up to save people at the risk of their own lives when people are in danger. These exemplary behaviors are worth learning from by everyone. People's abilities vary, and the work they do is also different, but as long as they have the will and determination to serve the people wholeheartedly, they can do extraordinary things and emit brilliant light and heat for the cause of the country and the people. Some comrades on the political and legal front who still think that "political and legal work is not promising" especially need to learn from these advanced figures.
    Second, learn from their creative working methods of participating in production, protecting production, working while laboring, and their working style of integrating with the masses. How can political and legal work be combined with production, serve the central work, and serve socialist construction? This requires political and legal workers to go deep into the workers and peasants, go deep into various production sites, and devote themselves to the vigorous production movement, protecting production in production and protecting construction in construction. Because the current objective situation requires political and legal cadres not only to be red, but also to be expert; not only to understand class struggle and learn to correctly handle the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the contradictions among the people, but also to urgently need to understand production struggle and learn some production business knowledge. Only by participating in production, living with the masses, eating, living, working, and breathing with them, will the masses feel that your heart is given to them, and they will treat you as relatives and friends, and they will take the initiative to help you handle cases, maintain public order, and assist in doing a good job in political and legal work. The more and more widespread the support and active help the political and legal work receives from the masses, the more the quality of the political and legal work will be improved, and the greater the achievements of the leap forward will be.
    The delegates to the conference are all advanced workers on the political and legal front. Advanced workers should play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role among the masses. In the past great leap forward in work, the representatives were able to take the lead actively, work hard, successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the state, do many good things for the people, have many new creations, and play the exemplary role they should have played. Now everyone is gathered together, listening to various reports and instructions from leading comrades, exchanging experiences with each other, learning "scriptures" and taking "treasures", which is to prepare for playing a greater role. It is hoped that the delegates to the conference will earnestly impart their experiences, learn with an open mind, and bring back the valuable instructions and rich experiences obtained at the conference to various places, so that they can take root, blossom and flourish among the broad masses as soon as possible, so as to promote the continued great leap forward in the national political and legal work!

### 学习先进，做好政法工作

    学习先进，做好政法工作
    拥有两千三百多位代表的全国公安、检察和司法先进工作者代表大会开幕了。这是政法工作大跃进成绩检阅大会，是政法战线的群英大会，是政法工作的先进经验交流大会。
    在全民大跃进的形势下，去年以来，政法工作也有很大跃进。各种民事案件和刑事案件显著下降，劳改犯人迅速得到改造，社会秩序空前安定。这都说明政法工作的大跃进已获得了辉煌成绩。当然，这些成绩的获得是与人民觉悟的逐渐提高，党对政法工作的坚强领导，全体政法工作人员的共同努力分不开的。但是，无疑的，政法战线近一年来所涌现出的数以万计的先进工作者，则是创造这些成绩的带头人，是推动政法工作继续大跃进的有力因素。因此，这些先进工作者应当受到人们的尊敬，应当得到表扬，特别值得全体政法工作人员学习。
    向他们学习什么呢？首先，学习他们在对敌（特务、反革命分子等）斗争中不顾一切地保卫祖国安全，保卫人民生命财产的英雄行为和自我牺牲精神。学习他们忠于职守，平时对人民体贴入微，扶老携幼，寻亲觅友，而遇人民发生危险时就挺身出来舍己救人的高尚的共产主义品德和全心全意为人民服务的精神。他们这些模范行为，值得大家好好学习。人的能力有大有小，所作的工作也各有不同，但只要有全心全意为人民服务的意志和决心，都可以做出不平凡的事情，可以为国家为人民的事业发出灿烂的光和热。至今还认为“政法工作没什么搞头”的政法战线上的一些同志，就特别需要向这些先进人物学习。
    第二，学习他们参加生产、保卫生产，一面劳动、一面办案的创造性的工作方法和同群众打成一片的工作作风。政法工作如何能做到同生产结合、为中心工作服务、为社会主义建设服务呢？这就需要政法工作人员深入到工农群众中去，深入到各种生产现场中去，投入轰轰烈烈的生产运动，在生产中保卫生产，在建设中保卫建设。因为当前客观形势要求政法干部，不仅要红，也要专；不仅要懂得阶级斗争，学会正确处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，而且也迫切需要懂得生产斗争，学习一些生产业务知识。只有参加了生产，同群众生活在一起，同他们同吃同住同劳动同呼吸，群众才会觉得你的心是交给他的，才会把你当成亲人和朋友，才会主动帮你办案子，维持治安，协助做好政法工作。而政法工作得到群众的支持和主动帮助愈多，愈广泛，那么政法工作的质量就会更加提高，跃进的成绩也会更大。
    与会代表都是政法战线上的先进工作者。先进工作者在群众中应起带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。代表们在过去工作大跃进中，都能积极带头，艰苦奋斗，出色地完成了党和国家交给的任务，为人民群众办了许多好事情，有许多新的创造，起到了应起的模范作用。现在大家会集一堂，正在听取领导同志的各种报告和指示，正在互相交流经验，学“经”取“宝”，这正是为发挥更大作用做好准备工作。希望与会代表认真传授经验，虚心学习，把大会上所取得的宝贵指示和丰富经验带回各地去，让它在广大群众中尽快地生根开花，发扬光大，以便推动全国政法工作的继续大跃进！
