Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 19th: The ranks of Mongolian and other minority ethnic workers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are growing and expanding. Currently, there are over 43,000 Mongolian workers distributed across various fronts in the autonomous region, and the number of workers from eighteen minority ethnic groups, including Hui, Manchu, Daur, Korean, Ewenki, and Oroqen, has also grown to over 15,000. Nearly half of these ethnic workers are responsible for production and construction tasks in key national industrial enterprises, local industrial enterprises, and transportation and telecommunications departments.

When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was first established twelve years ago, there were only about 10,000 workers in the entire region, and the vast majority of them were Han Chinese. Mongolian and other minority ethnic workers were few and far between. In order to meet the needs of the developing construction undertakings in the autonomous region, the Party and the People's Government adopted various measures to vigorously train ethnic workers. By 1956, the number of Mongolian workers in the region had increased tenfold compared to 1949, and the number of other minority ethnic workers had also increased twelvefold. Later, with the development of industries such as steel, forestry, machinery manufacturing, dairy products, and wool textiles, especially after the high tide of the Great Leap Forward last year, the total number of workers in the region increased from more than 167,000 in 1952 to 600,000. The ranks of minority ethnic workers have also further developed. Currently, the number of workers from twelve ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, and Korean, working in the Baotou Iron and Steel Company has reached more than 1,700. In the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, the number of Mongolian, Daur, Ewenki, and Oroqen workers has also more than doubled compared to three years ago, reaching about 10,000.

The majority of this ethnic worker force has been trained by Party organizations in various places through schools and training classes. Another part has been cultivated by Han Chinese veteran workers in their respective enterprises through methods such as apprenticeship. Under the cultivation of the Party and the enthusiastic assistance of Han Chinese workers, the minority ethnic workers quickly mastered various production skills, their technical level continuously improved, and a group of advanced producers and technical innovation experts emerged. This spring, Wu Liansheng, a Mongolian tractor driver from the Yituli River Forestry Bureau in the Greater Khingan Mountains, and his assistant Wen Tieniu, through painstaking research and improved operating methods, created a national record for ice road timber transport, transporting 525 cubic meters of timber in a single trip. Timber collection workers and timber truck drivers of all ethnic groups in the forest area have actively followed suit, breaking through the original production quotas and creating many new records, promoting the leap forward in timber production throughout the forest area. In the past, the Baotou Automobile Repair Factory used manual dies to produce silicon steel sheets for generators, which was inefficient and labor-intensive. Jin Shan, a Mongolian youth fitter at the factory, after painstaking research, successfully developed a die-stamping machine, reducing the time to stamp a silicon steel sheet from eight hours to twenty-five seconds.

    推动内蒙古各项建设事业不断发展
    少数民族职工队伍成长壮大
    新华社呼和浩特19日电　内蒙古自治区蒙古族和各少数民族职工队伍成长壮大。目前分布在自治区各个战线上的蒙古族职工已达四万三千多人，回、满、达斡尔、朝鲜、鄂温克、鄂伦春等十八个少数民族的职工人数也发展到了一万五千人以上。在这批民族职工中，有将近半数的人分别担负着国家重点工业企业、地方工业企业和交通邮电等部门的生产建设任务。
    十二年前内蒙古自治区刚建立时，全区只有一万左右职工，而且其中绝大多数是汉族，蒙古族和其它少数民族职工寥寥无几，为了适应自治区各项建设事业发展的需要，党和人民政府采取各种措施大力培养民族职工，到1956年，全区蒙古族职工就比1949年增加了十倍，其它少数民族职工也增加了十二倍。以后，随着钢铁、森林、机械制造、乳品、毛纺织等工业的发展，特别是经过去年大跃进高潮，全区职工人数已由1952年的十六万七千多人增加到六十万人，少数民族职工队伍也有了进一步发展。目前，在包头钢铁公司中工作的蒙古、回、满、朝鲜等十二个民族的职工人数已有一千七百多人。在大兴安岭林区，蒙古族和达斡尔、鄂温克、鄂伦春等族职工也比三年前增加了一倍多，达到一万人左右。
    这支民族职工队伍，大部分是由各地党组织开办学校、训练班培养出来的，另外一部分是由所在企业的汉族老工人采取师傅带徒弟等方式帮助培养出来的。在党的培养和汉族职工的热情帮助下，各少数民族职工很快掌握了各种生产知识，技术水平不断提高，并涌现出了一批先进生产者和技术革新能手，今年春天，大兴安岭伊图里河林业局蒙古族拖拉机手吴连生，同他的助手温铁牛共同苦心钻研，改进操作方法，曾创造了一次运材五百二十五立方公尺的全国冰道运材最高纪录。林区各族集材工人和运材汽车驾驶员纷纷急起直追，突破了原来的生产定额，创造很多新的纪录，促进了整个林区木材生产的跃进。包头汽车修配厂过去制作发电机矽钢片，用手工冲模，效率低，又费工。这个厂的蒙古族青年钳工金山经过苦心钻研，试制成功一台冲模机，使冲制一片矽钢片的时间由原来的八小时减少到二十五秒钟。
