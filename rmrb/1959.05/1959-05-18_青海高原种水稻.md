Planting Rice on the Qinghai Plateau

(This newspaper dispatch) This paper reports that Qinghai, which has never produced rice since ancient times, began to trial planting rice under the leadership of the Party after liberation in 1956, and achieved success last year in the Lao Ya Commune and Gao Miao Commune.

This year, Ledu County plans to expand rice cultivation to 300 mu, and the Party committees of various communes attach great importance to this. Last autumn, they focused on deep plowing and applying sufficient base fertilizer, and before sowing, they rushed to level the land and prepare the seeds. At present, a bustling scene is unfolding on both sides of the Huangshui River, as people joyfully plant more rice on the Qinghai Plateau. (Bu Wenda)

    青海高原种水稻
    本报讯　自古以来不产大米的青海，解放后在党的领导下，从1956年开始试种水稻，去年在老牙公社和高庙公社获得成功。
    今年乐都县计划扩种水稻三百亩，各公社党委很重视。去年秋季大抓深翻和施足基肥，播种前又突击平整土地和作好种子处理。目前，湟水两岸呈现一片繁忙的景象，人们欢乐地把更多的稻谷种在青海高原上。　（步文达）
