Strengthen Enterprise Management and Improve Rules and Regulations

Reasonable rules and regulations are the guidelines for the actions of all employees in an enterprise and an important measure to ensure the normal operation of production. Therefore, all industrial and mining enterprises must, under the leadership of the Party Committee, proceed from the needs of production and, based on the experience of the previous stage of reforming rules and regulations, establish and improve various rules and regulations to ensure the continued leap forward in production and construction this year.

In 1958, many enterprises, in the victory of rectification and the realization of the Great Leap Forward in production, relied on the broad masses of employees to conduct an inspection and revision of the rules and regulations established after liberation. They eliminated some outdated and unreasonable rules and regulations and established many new rules and regulations, which promoted the development of production. This was entirely correct and necessary. However, in the previous stage of reforming rules and regulations, due to the urgency of time, some enterprises abolished unreasonable rules and regulations, but new ones were not established in time, which has, to some extent, affected the orderly progress of production and product quality. This year, our production scale has expanded, many new products have been added, and many product varieties are developing towards heavy, large, precise, and advanced directions, and the requirements for product quality are even stricter. It is impossible to do without a reasonable and strict set of rules and regulations. In order to better complete the national plan, all enterprises should, while vigorously carrying out technological revolution and technological innovation, strengthen centralized leadership, further mobilize the broad masses of employees, and, based on the experience of the previous stage of reforming rules and regulations, in addition to continuing to reform those that should be abolished but have not been, the current main task is to "establish," that is, to proceed from the needs of production and establish a set of scientific management systems that are both suitable for the requirements of modern enterprises and facilitate the development of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, which is of great significance for the comprehensive realization of this year's Great Leap Forward in production.

It must be pointed out that the production of modern enterprises is a complex process with a high degree of science and organization. Each product, from the raw materials entering the factory to the product leaving the factory, requires the joint cooperation of many departments, workshops, groups, and workers. Therefore, everyone and every link must act according to the objective laws of the entire production process in order to ensure the normal progress of production and good production results. So what should be used to maintain this production order as a guideline for the actions of all employees in the entire production activity? That is to strengthen enterprise management while carrying out mass movements and establish a set of scientific management systems that are both suitable for the production requirements of modern enterprises and facilitate the development of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. When rules and regulations correctly reflect the relationship between people within the enterprise and the objective laws of production, they are conducive to giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and not only do not bind the development of productive forces, but also protect productive forces and promote the development of productive forces. Reasonable rules and regulations must be strictly enforced and cannot be violated. Violation will cause chaos in production. The Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, in carrying out mass movements, adopted the "three-in-one" method, mobilized the masses to review the abolished rules and regulations, and established and improved the rules and regulations according to the needs of production. A new situation of double leaps forward in quality and quantity has emerged in production, proving the necessity of establishing and improving rules and regulations in modern industry.

However, everything is in a process of continuous development and change. Rules and regulations belong to the category of the superstructure, and they must also continuously develop, improve, and upgrade with the development and improvement of production skills and enterprise management, as well as people's understanding of objective laws. Therefore, no rules and regulations should ever be regarded as eternally不变 (unchanging) and sacred and inviolable. Various rules and regulations must be tested according to the constantly developing objective situation. Those that are reasonable should be retained; those that are unreasonable should be modified and abolished; and those that need to be established but have not yet been established should be formulated in a timely manner. Therefore, the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations will continue in the future, which is certain. However, the abolition and modification of unreasonable rules and regulations do not mean that rules and regulations are not needed. Effective rules and regulations must be conscientiously implemented. "Breaking" and "establishing" are a unity of opposites. "Breaking" is for the sake of "establishing." Therefore, the view that only "breaking" is needed and "establishing" is not needed is a one-sided understanding and practice, which will lead to chaotic phenomena in some production links where there are no rules to follow, affecting the development of productive forces.

Relying on the masses and adopting the method of joint discussion by leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers is the most effective way to establish and improve new rules and regulations. Because the masses' production practice is the only criterion for testing whether rules and regulations are reasonable. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, expose contradictions in production, and rely on the masses to resolve contradictions. In establishing new systems, it should be done with both democracy and centralization. It is necessary to both break superstitions and emancipate the mind, and seek truth from facts and conduct scientific analysis. It is necessary to widely absorb the good experiences of the workers, adopt the method of joint experimentation and appraisal by management personnel, technical personnel, and workers, and then promote it from point to area, which can not only make the improvement of rules and regulations progress rapidly, but also improve the masses' consciousness of implementation. The "breaking" and "establishing" of rules and regulations in technical management should not only fully mobilize the masses to discuss and conduct experiments, but also be reviewed and approved by the relevant competent authorities before they can be implemented, because only in this way can the "breaking" and "establishing" of rules and regulations achieve better results.

### 加强企业管理健全规章制度

    加强企业管理健全规章制度
    合理的规章制度，是企业全体职工行动的准绳，也是保证企业生产正常进行的重要措施。因此，各工矿企业必须在党委领导下，从生产需要出发，根据前一个阶段改革规章制度的经验，建立与健全各种规章制度，以保证实现今年生产建设的继续跃进。
    1958年许多企业在取得整风胜利和实现生产大跃进中，依靠广大职工群众，对解放后建立起来的规章制度，进行了一次检查和修改，破除了一些过时了的不合理的规章制度，建立了许多新的规章制度，促进了生产的发展，这是完全正确的，必要的。但是在前一个阶段的改革规章制度中，由于时间仓促，有些企业破了不合理的规章制度，新的还没有及时建立起来，在某种程度上已影响到生产的有秩序进行和影响产品质量。今年我们的生产规模扩大了，新产品增加很多，许多产品品种向重、大、精、尖方向发展，对产品质量要求就更加严格，没有一套合理而严密的规章制度是不行的。为了更好的完成国家计划，各企业应当在大搞技术革命、技术革新的同时，加强集中领导，进一步发动广大职工根据前一阶段的改革规章制度的经验，除了对那些应破而没有破的继续进行改革外，当前主要的是“立”，即根据生产的需要出发，建立起一套既适合现代企业要求，又便于发挥群众积极性和创造性的科学管理制度，对全面实现今年生产大跃进具有很大意义。
    必须指出，现代化企业的生产是个复杂的过程，有着高度的科学性和组织性，每个产品从原材料进厂到产品出厂，需要许多部门、车间、小组和工人共同协作。因此每一个人，每一个环节都必须按着整个生产的客观规律办事，才能保证生产的正常进行和生产的良好效果。那么用什么东西来维护这种生产秩序，作为全体职工在整个生产活动中行动的准绳呢？那就要在大搞群众运动的同时，加强企业管理，建立一套既适合现代化企业生产要求，又便于发挥群众积极性和创造性的科学管理制度。当规章制度正确反映企业内部人与人之间的关系和生产的客观规律时，它们就有利于发挥群众的积极性和创造性，不仅不束缚生产力的发展，而且能够保护生产力、促进生产力的发展。对于合理的规章制度必须严格执行，不能违反。违反了就要造成生产的混乱。哈尔滨电机厂在大搞群众运动中，采取三结合的办法，发动群众复查了破除的规章制度，并根据生产需要，建立和健全了规章制度，生产出现了质量、产量双跃进的新局面，证明了现代化工业建立健全规章制度的必要性。
    但是，任何事物都是处在不断的发展和变化着的过程，规章制度是属于上层建筑范畴，它也必然要随着生产技能和企业管理以及人们对客观规律认识的发展和提高，不断发展、改进和提高。因此绝不能把任何规章制度看成为永恒的不变的和神圣不可侵犯。必须根据不断的发展了的客观情况来检验各种规章制度，对于其中合理部分，要加以保留；对于其中不合理的部分，要加以修改和废除；对于需要建立而还没有建立的，要及时制订新的制度。因此今后对不合理的规章制度仍然要继续进行改革，这是肯定的。但对不合理的规章制度的废除和修改，绝不意味着不要规章制度，对行之有效的规章制度必须认真贯彻执行。破和立是对立的统一，破是为了立，因此，那种只要破不要立，是种片面的认识和作法，会导致某些生产环节无章可循的混乱现象，影响生产力的发展。
    依靠群众，采取领导干部、技术人员、工人共同讨论的办法，是建立健全新的规章制度的最有效方法。因为群众生产实践是检验规章制度是否合理的唯一标准。因此必须发动群众大鸣大放，揭露生产中的矛盾和依靠群众解决矛盾。在建立新制度时，应该作到既有民主、又有集中。既要破除迷信、解放思想，又要实事求是进行科学分析。要广泛吸收工人群众的好经验，采取管理人员和技术人员和工人共同进行试验和鉴定，然后由点到面的推行，不仅使规章制度的改进工作能够进展得迅速，而且还能提高群众贯彻执行的自觉性。对技术管理方面的规章制度的破和立，不仅要充分发动群众讨论，要经过试验，而且还要经过有关主管部门审查和批准才能实行，因为只有这样才能使规章制度的破和立收到更好的效果。　（摘自黑龙江日报社论）
