    Taiyuan, May 17th (This newspaper dispatch) - Workers at the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, who pioneered the three-trough steel tapping method, have recently created an automatic steel diverter, an automatic slag skimmer, and an automatic crane transmission in the midst of a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution campaign, enabling the three-trough steel tapping method to exert even greater power without adding much equipment. These three technical innovations play a significant role in increasing the output and quality of open-hearth steelmaking, reducing the labor intensity of workers, and improving labor productivity.
    Three-trough steel tapping can nearly double the furnace charge without increasing the number of cranes or reinforcing the plant building. However, this also leads to new imbalances. More material is charged, and more slag is produced, requiring rapid slag removal to reduce gas consumption and further shorten the smelting time; more steel is produced, requiring precise control of the molten steel flow for timely casting. The automatic slag skimmer and automatic steel diverter created by Li Naizheng's electrical team in Class C provide extremely favorable conditions for reducing sulfur content and shortening smelting time. In the past, manual slag skimming required workers to exert considerable effort for forty to fifty minutes to complete. The automatic slag skimmer, resembling a locomotive connecting rod, can move back and forth inside the furnace, driven by a motor, and skims the slag in just over ten minutes. Since the adoption of three-trough steel tapping, the molten steel flows rapidly, and it is difficult to manually control the steel diverter evenly, often resulting in molten steel overflowing. The automatic steel diverter not only saves manpower but also provides stable control. It can quickly control overflowing steel if it occurs. Jia Yingui's electrical team in Class B boldly experimented and successfully developed a crane quick-change transmission, significantly increasing the speed of crane lifting and transporting steel ladles. With this transmission, fully loaded ladles can be lifted slowly for safety, while empty ladles can be lifted at a faster speed. This overcomes the previous limitations of cranes operating at the same speed regardless of whether they are fully or lightly loaded, thereby shortening the casting time of molten steel.
    Since the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant switched to three-trough steel tapping last year, the output per furnace has increased by nearly half, completing last year's production plan ahead of schedule. This year, steel production has been rising month by month. To complete this year's leap forward plan without adding much equipment, the plant's Party committee has proposed adapting to the needs of three-trough steel tapping by focusing on furnace maintenance, preventing steel overflow, promoting the advanced experience of "high-temperature thin slag," and shortening smelting time. Since April, all plant workers, in a high-quality, high-yield competition centered on technological innovation, have focused on the key production points of three-trough steel tapping, and everyone has contributed ideas, enabling these three major technological innovations to be quickly trial-produced and applied to production.

### 太钢创造自动分钢舵、自动扒渣机、天车自动变速机  三槽出钢发挥更大威力

    太钢创造自动分钢舵、自动扒渣机、天车自动变速机
    三槽出钢发挥更大威力
    本报太原17日电　首创三槽出钢的太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂职工，最近在大闹技术革新和技术革命中先后创造了自动分钢舵、自动扒渣机，天车自动变速机，使三槽出钢在没有增加多少设备的情况下发挥出更大的威力。这三项技术革新对提高平炉炼钢的产量、质量和减轻工人劳动强度提高劳动生产率，起着重大作用。
    三槽出钢能在不增加天车，不加固厂房的情况下，使装炉量增加近一倍。可是随之而来的出现了新的不平衡现象，料装多了，渣子也增多，需要尽快清渣，才能减少煤气消耗，进一步缩短冶炼时间；钢出的多了，就需要准确地控制钢水流量，及时浇铸。丙班李乃正电工小组创造的自动扒渣机和自动分钢舵给减少硫分、缩短冶炼时间创造了极有利的条件。过去是人工扒渣，工人们费好大力气用四、五十分钟才能扒完。自动扒渣机像火车头的连杆一样，可以在炉内往复移动，在马达带动下，只用十几分钟就扒光了。三槽出钢以来钢水流得急，人力控制分钢舵不容易均匀地控制流量，往往发生钢水外溢现象。自动分钢舵不仅省了人，而且能抄得稳。一旦发生溢钢现象也能很快节制住。乙班贾银贵电工小组大胆试验成功天车快速变速机，大大提高了天车吊运钢罐的速率。采用这种变速机，吊满负荷的大罐子，为了安全可以慢些，吊空罐子就加快速度。这就改变了过去天车无论满负荷，空负荷都是一样速度的限制，缩短了钢水的浇铸时间。
    太原钢铁公司第二炼钢厂从去年改为三槽出钢以来，每炉钢的产量提高了近一半，提前完成了去年的生产计划。今年钢产量逐月上升。为了在不多加设备的条件下完成今年的跃进计划，该厂党委提出，要从炉子维护，防止溢钢、推广“高温薄渣”先进经验、缩短冶炼时间等方面，来适应三槽出钢的需要。4月份以来，全厂职工在以技术革新为中心内容的优质、高产竞赛中，对准三槽出钢的生产关键，人人献计，使这三项重大的技术革新很快试制成功，并运用到生产中去。
