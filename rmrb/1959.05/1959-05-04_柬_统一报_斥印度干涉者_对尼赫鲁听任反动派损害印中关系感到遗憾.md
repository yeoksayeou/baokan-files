Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 2nd: The Cambodian "Unity Daily" published an editorial yesterday stating that although the situation in Tibet has returned to normal, imperialist elements and their running dogs still want to continue to expand it into an international problem.

The newspaper, after mentioning the large number of messages and articles published by Western news agencies and Indian newspapers, pointed out that the imperialist elements and their running dogs are doing their utmost to expand the Tibetan incident, an internal affair of China. Their purpose is: first, to find excuses to poison the world atmosphere; second, to split the unity of Asian countries.

The newspaper also said that the imperialists are pinning their hopes on certain Indian expansionists who are trying to place Tibet under Indian rule. These Indian expansionists are supporters of Tibetan traitors. They unreasonably attack the Chinese government, and they have greatly damaged friendly relations between China and India. The newspaper pointed out, "We regret that the Indian government, headed by Nehru, allows (or colludes with) Indian reactionaries to carry out activities that harm India, China, and peace."

    柬“统一报”斥印度干涉者
    对尼赫鲁听任反动派损害印中关系感到遗憾
    新华社金边2日电　柬埔寨“统一报”昨天发表社论说，虽然西藏的局势已经恢复正常，但是帝国主义分子和他们的走狗还想继续把它扩大成为国际问题。
    这家报纸在提到西方通讯社和印度报纸所发表的大量消息和文章以后指出，帝国主义分子和他们的走狗竭尽全力来扩大中国内政问题西藏事件的目的是：第一，寻找借口来毒化世界气氛；第二，分裂亚洲国家的团结。
    这家报纸还说，帝国主义者把希望寄托于那些企图把西藏置于印度统治之下的印度某些扩张主义分子身上。这些印度扩张主义分子是西藏卖国贼的支持者。他们无理地攻击中国政府，他们已经在很大程度上损害了中印友好关系。这家报纸指出，“我们对以尼赫鲁为首的印度政府听任（或者伙同）印度的反动分子进行损害印度、中国与和平的活动感到遗憾”。
