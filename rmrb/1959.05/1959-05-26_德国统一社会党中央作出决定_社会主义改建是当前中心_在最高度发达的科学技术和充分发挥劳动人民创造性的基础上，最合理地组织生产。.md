Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 24th: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its fifth plenary session on the 22nd and 23rd.

According to the communique of the plenary session published today by "Neues Deutschland", the meeting focused on and unanimously adopted the report "Realizing the Seven-Year Plan Through Socialist Transformation and Improving Labor Productivity" made by Erich Apel, Director of the Economic Commission of the Central Political Bureau.

First Secretary of the Central Committee, Ulbricht, made a concluding speech at the meeting.

The communique said that socialist transformation is a decisive measure for realizing the Seven-Year Plan. Its content is to organize production most rationally on the basis of the most highly developed science and technology and full play of the creativity and initiative of the working people. Socialist transformation requires strict discipline, exemplary order, and the strictest thrift in all enterprises and state and economic institutions. The communique pointed out that it is necessary to quickly overcome the view that socialist transformation can only be achieved through huge investments.

The communique said that the realization of socialist transformation will create the preconditions for further improving the living standards of the working people; it is the path to catch up with and surpass West Germany not only in terms of per capita product output, but also in terms of labor productivity.

The communique said that the key at present is to bring the science and technology of the German Democratic Republic to the world level.

The communique emphasized that socialist transformation must be placed at the center of the Party's, economic and state work. The task now is to rapidly improve leadership.

The meeting also heard and unanimously adopted the report made by Edith Baumann on behalf of the Central Political Bureau, and passed a draft law on the socialist development of schools in the German Democratic Republic, which will be submitted to the Council of Ministers and the People's Chamber for discussion. In addition, the meeting also passed suggestions on improving the education level of the working people and the socialist development of vocational education in the German Democratic Republic.
