Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th: Twenty-seven Japanese groups from all walks of life jointly held a conference in Tokyo today, demanding improved relations between Japan and China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam.

Approximately eight hundred representatives attending the conference unanimously passed resolutions and declarations. The resolution pointed out that achieving friendly relations with these neighboring countries is the first step toward making Japan an independent and prosperous nation. The resolution demanded that the Japanese government cease its hostile policy toward China and establish diplomatic relations with China; and immediately conclude a Japanese-Soviet peace treaty. The resolution also demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government implement the decision to repatriate Korean residents in Japan to North Korea, allow direct trade and free exchange between Japan and North Korea, and postpone compensation to Vietnam until Vietnam is unified.

The resolution called for the development of cultural and economic exchanges with other Asian countries based on a neutral policy.

The declaration stated that the twenty-seven groups are determined to launch a national movement until the above demands are realized.

Socialist Party member, Kono Mitsu, and Communist Party member, Hakamada Satomi, spoke at the conference, calling on attendees to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet through the House of Councillors election.

The twenty-seven groups jointly holding this conference include the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the Japan-Soviet Association, the Japan-Korea Association, the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association, as well as labor unions, peace, and trade groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, refuting the Nobusuke Kishi government's reply on the 15th to the Soviet government's note regarding the hope that Japan would implement a neutral policy, as well as the Liberal Democratic Party's statement. The editorial said that this was a reply and statement attempting to legitimize the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's submission to the United States' war policy.

The editorial pointed out that although the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet verbally expressed opposition to nuclear testing and said that Japan would not implement nuclear armament, in fact, it refused to announce a ban on nuclear armament in the previous Diet session; and stipulated in the second expansion plan that the focus of expanding armaments should be on implementing missile development and nuclear armament. The editorial also pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government attempted to shift the responsibility for the failure to resolve the issue of banning nuclear weapons onto the Soviet Union in its reply, but the real responsibility lies with the US imperialists.

The editorial said that if the Nobusuke Kishi government is truly opposed to nuclear armament in Asia and Japan, then it should adopt the Soviet Union's proposal to establish nuclear-free zones in the Far East and the Pacific region, and make this request to the US government.

The editorial pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government's purpose in shifting the responsibility for banning nuclear weapons onto the Soviet Union is to incite anti-Soviet sentiment, divert the Japanese people's attention, and prevent them from opposing the Japan-US "Security Treaty."

"Akahata" said: The Nobusuke Kishi government said in its reply that because the Soviet Union tore up the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, it could not trust the Soviet Union. This statement does not conform to the actual situation; it was the Japanese Emperor and Tojo's cabinet's army that tore up the neutrality treaty. The newspaper pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government is concealing this historical fact and once again bandying about words with revanchist sentiments, and this action exposes their militarist intentions.

"Akahata" refuted the Nobusuke Kishi government's claim that the Soviet Union was "interfering" in Japan's internal affairs, pointing out that it is the US imperialists who are actually invading Japan, North Korea, and occupying Taiwan, and therefore, the US imperialists are the common enemy of the Asian people. The editorial said that the Nobusuke Kishi government, on the one hand, sells Japan's sovereignty to the United States, and on the other hand, shouts that the Soviet Union is "interfering in internal affairs," which is the most shameful behavior.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union's demand that Japan maintain neutrality is consistent with the feelings of the vast majority of Japanese people who hope for peace, security, and national dignity. The editorial condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party for saying that the demands made by the Soviet Union are unrealistic, but it is the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party themselves who want to keep the status quo of subservience to the United States unchanged and go against the general trend of the world. "Akahata" concluded by saying that the Nobusuke Kishi government's reply to the Soviet Union is a malicious propaganda campaign against the Japanese people. "Akahata" called on all Communist Party members to thoroughly expose the essence of this reply in the struggle to campaign for senators, organize the people to fight back, and fight against it.

    日本各界二十七个团体联合举行大会
    要求改善日本同社会主义国家关系
    “赤旗报”谴责岸政府妄图诬蔑苏联以转移人民视听
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本各界二十七个团体今天在东京联合举行大会，要求改善日本同中国、苏联、朝鲜和越南的关系。
    参加大会的大约八百名代表一致通过了决议和宣言。决议指出，同这些邻国实现友好关系是使日本成为独立和繁荣国家的第一步。决议要求日本政府停止敌视中国的政策，同中国建立外交关系；立即缔结日苏和约。决议还要求岸信介政府实现遣送旅日朝鲜侨民回国的决定，允许日本同朝鲜直接贸易和自由往来；并且推迟给越南的赔偿，直到越南统一为止。
    决议要求在中立政策的基础上发展同其他亚洲国家间的文化和经济交流。
    宣言表示，二十七个团体决心要展开国民运动，直到实现上述要求为止。
    社会党的河野密和共产党的裤田里见在大会上讲话，号召与会者通过参议员选举来打倒岸信介内阁。
    联合举行这次大会的二十七个团体中包括恢复日中邦交国民会议、日苏协会、日朝协会、日越友好协会和工会、和平、贸易团体等。
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，驳斥岸信介政府15日对苏联政府关于希望日本实行中立政策的照会的复照和自由民主党的声明。社论说，这是企图使岸信介内阁屈从美国的战争政策合法化的答复和声明。
    社论指出，岸信介内阁虽然在口头上表示反对核试验并且说日本不实行核武装，可是，事实上却在上一次的国会会议上拒绝宣布禁止核武装；并且在第二次扩军计划中规定要以实行导弹化和核武装为扩充军备的重点。社论还指出，岸信介政府在复照中企图把禁止核武器问题没有得到解决的责任推到苏联身上，但是真正应该负这个责任的是美帝国主义者。
    社论说，如果岸信介政府真正是反对在亚洲和日本实行核武装的，那么，就应该采纳苏联提出的关于在远东和太平洋地区建立禁止核武装地区的建议，并且向美国政府提出这个要求。
    社论指出，岸信介政府把禁止核武器的责任推到苏联身上去的目的在于，煽起反苏浪潮，转移日本人民的视线，使他们不再去反对日美“安全条约”。
      “赤旗报”说：岸信介政府在复照中说，因为苏联撕毁了苏日中立条约，所以不能相信苏联。这是不符合实际情况的说法；撕毁了中立条约的是日本天皇和东条内阁的军队。这家报纸指出，岸信介政府掩盖这个历史事实并且再次搬弄带有复仇主义性质的词句，这个行动暴露了他们的军国主义的意图。
      “赤旗报”驳斥岸信介政府说苏联“干涉”日本内政时指出，实际上在侵略日本、朝鲜和侵占台湾等的是美国帝国主义，因此，美国帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人。社论说，岸信介政府一方面把日本的主权出卖给美国，一方面却叫嚷苏联“干涉内政”，这是最可耻的行为。
    社论说，苏联提出的关于要日本守中立的要求，同绝大多数日本人民希望和平、安全和有民族尊严的心情是一致的。社论谴责说，岸信介政府和自由民主党说什么苏联提出的要求是不现实的，但是，要使屈从美国的现状丝毫不变并且违背世界大势的正是岸信介政府和自由民主党自己。“赤旗报”最后说，岸信介政府对苏联提出的答复是一种对日本人民进行的恶意宣传。“赤旗报”号召全体共产党党员应该在竞选参议员的斗争中，彻底地揭露这个答复的本质，组织人民进行反击，对它进行斗争。（附图片）
