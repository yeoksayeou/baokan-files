    Famous Handicraft of the Bouyei Ethnic Group
    Libo Bamboo Mat Production Expands
    Libo bamboo mats, a famous handicraft of the Bouyei ethnic group, are currently undergoing expanded production. In Libo Town, Dushan County, Qiannan Bouyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, its place of origin, a new bamboo mat factory has been established. Fifty Bouyei mat-weaving artisans have been gathered there to weave bamboo mats of various specifications.
    Libo bamboo mats are known for their smoothness, toughness and flexibility. They can be folded and rolled up, and when unfolded for use, they still show no creases. The mats are woven with over a dozen patterns with the unique artistic style of the Bouyei ethnic group, such as copper coins and plum blossoms. They are beautiful and durable, and are very popular among people in tropical regions. In recent years, several thousand mats have been produced annually and sold both domestically and abroad.
    The Bouyei people have been weaving bamboo mats for over a hundred years. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government vigorously helped local artisans develop bamboo mat production. With the establishment of a bamboo mat factory here this year, it will be possible to organize full-time workers to further improve the output and quality of bamboo mats.

    布依族著名的手工艺品
    荔波竹席扩大生产
    布依族著名的手工艺品荔波竹席目前正在扩大生产。它的产地黔南布依族苗族自治州独山县荔波镇上，新办起了竹席工厂，已有五十名布依族编席手工艺工人集中在那里编造各种规格的竹席。
    荔波竹席以光滑韧软著称。它可以折叠包卷，使用时铺开来，仍不显痕迹。席上编有布依族独特艺术风格的铜钱、梅花等十数种图案，美观耐用，很受热带地区人民的欢迎，近几年来每年生产数千床行销国内外。
    布依族人民编造竹席已有约一百多年的历史。解放后，党和人民政府大力帮助当地艺人发展了竹席生产。今年这里建立了竹席厂后，将可以组织专职工人进一步提?高竹席的产量和质量。
