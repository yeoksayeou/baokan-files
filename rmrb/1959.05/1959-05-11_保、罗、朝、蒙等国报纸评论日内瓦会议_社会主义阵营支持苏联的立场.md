Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 10th. The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" wrote on the 9th, in a commentary on the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, that the Geneva Conference should reach an agreement on resolving two particularly important international issues – concluding a peace treaty with Germany and adjusting the status of West Berlin – and open a beginning for mutual understanding between countries, so that international tensions can be greatly eased. All this will create favorable conditions for solving other pressing issues such as the prohibition of nuclear weapons, universal disarmament, and the establishment of a security system, thereby creating a solid foundation for international peace and security.

The commentary said that the Soviet Union and all countries of the socialist camp, as well as many peace-loving countries in the world, are taking this attitude towards the Geneva Conference. Unfortunately, some people and groups in the West still view this conference through the lens of "Cold War" and "position of strength" policies. They are trying every means to worsen the atmosphere, wanting to predetermine the failure of the negotiations, especially to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the adjustment of the status of West Berlin.

"Trud" warned the imperialists in its commentary: The Soviet Union's position is widely supported around the world, and the entire socialist camp is taking this position. The people of all countries hope that the delegations participating in the Geneva Conference will show a sincere desire and sincerity for negotiation and problem-solving, and consider the interests of all countries and the interests of universal peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 9th. The Romanian newspaper "Scînteia" published an editorial on the 9th, saying that world public opinion demands that the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference make valuable contributions to easing international tensions, especially in eliminating the aggressive danger of West Germany. Therefore, world public opinion demands that the Geneva Conference try to eliminate the abnormal situation in West Berlin, turn West Berlin into a free city, and conclude a peace treaty with Germany to ensure the elimination of the main source of tension in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. "Minju Choson" published a commentary today, saying: "The upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference will be another serious examination ground for testing the attitude of the Western powers towards the most pressing international issues."

The commentary pointed out that everyone clearly knows the universal significance of the current German problem, and delaying the resolution of such a pressing international issue is a serious threat to peace and security in Europe and the world. World just public opinion universally recognizes that concluding a peace treaty with Germany according to the Soviet proposal will eliminate all remnants of the occupation system, curb the revival of German militarism, reliably guarantee the security of the European people, open up broad avenues for the national development of the German people, and promote the unification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. The most reasonable plan put forward by the Soviet Union is a realistic basis for the East and West to reach an agreement on the German problem.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 10th. The Mongolian newspaper "Ünen" published a commentary today saying that the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has attracted the attention of world public opinion. The convening of this conference will create the necessary conditions for a summit meeting.

The commentary pointed out that the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany is the focus of public attention. More than ten years have passed since the end of the war, but a peace treaty with Germany has not yet been concluded, and no one can consider this normal. West Berlin is still occupied by Western imperialism and has become a breeding ground for new war threats. The commentary said that it is time to end this situation. Only the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany can clear the way for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

The commentary emphasized that the Soviet Union is pursuing a just and unwavering policy on the German issue, and the Soviet Union's policy is in line with the vital interests of the German people. People fully support the Soviet Union's proposal and solemnly demand that Western countries not obstruct the resolution of the German problem under any pretext.

    保、罗、朝、蒙等国报纸评论日内瓦会议
    社会主义阵营支持苏联的立场
    新华社索非亚10日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”9日在评论即将举行的日内瓦外长会议时写道，日内瓦会议应当就解决两个特别重要的国际问题——缔结对德和约和调整西柏林地位——达成协议，并为各国之间的互相谅解打开开端，以使国际紧张局势能够大大和缓。这一切将会给解决其他迫切的问题如禁止核武器、普遍裁军、建立安全体系等问题创造有利的条件，从而给国际和平和安全创造巩固的基础。
    评论说，苏联和社会主义阵营所有国家以及世界上许多爱好和平的国家对日内瓦会议正采取了这种态度。遗憾的是，西方的某些人士和集团仍旧以“冷战”和“实力地位”政策的眼光来看这次会议。他们千方百计地恶化气氛，想使谈判预先注定就失败，特别是阻挠缔结对德和约和调整西柏林的地位。
    “劳动报”在评论中警告帝国主义者说：苏联的立场得到世界各地的广泛支持，整个社会主义阵营都采取这种立场。各国人民希望参加日内瓦会议的代表团对谈判和解决问题表现出真诚的愿望和诚意，并考虑各国的利益和普遍和平的利益。
    新华社布加勒斯特9日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”9日发表社论说，世界各国舆论要求即将在日内瓦召开的外长会议，在缓和国际紧张局势，特别是在消除西德的侵略危险方面，作出有价值的贡献。因此，世界公众要求日内瓦会议设法消除西柏林不正常状况，使西柏林变成自由城市，缔结对德和约以保证消除欧洲紧张局势的主要发源地。
    新华社平壤10日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论说：“即将举行的日内瓦外长会议将是检验西方大国对目前最迫切的国际问题的态度的又一个严重的考试场。”
    评论指出，谁都清楚地知道当前德国问题的普遍意义，推迟解决这样迫切的国际问题是对欧洲和全世界和平和安全的严重威胁。世界公正舆论普遍承认，根据苏联建议缔结对德和约，将扫除占领制度的一切残余，制止德国军国主义的复活，可靠地保障欧洲人民的安全，为德国人民开辟民族发展的广阔道路，促进德国统一成为爱好和平的民主国家。苏联提出的这一最合理的方案是给东西方就德国问题达成协议的现实基础。
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表评论说，即将召开的日内瓦外长会议吸引了世界公众的注意。这一会议的召开将为首脑会议创造必要的条件。
    评论指出，缔结对德和约问题是舆论注意的中心。战争结束已经十几年了，而对德和约尚未缔结，任何人都不能认为这是正常的。西柏林仍然被西方帝国主义占领着，并成为新战争威胁的策源地。评论说，现在是结束这种局面的时候了。只有缔结对德和约才能为德国的和平统一扫清道路。
    评论强调说，苏联在德国问题上奉行着正义的坚定不移的政策，苏联的政策是符合德国人民的切身利益的。人们完全支持苏联的建议，严正要求西方国家不能以任何借口阻挠德国问题的解决。
