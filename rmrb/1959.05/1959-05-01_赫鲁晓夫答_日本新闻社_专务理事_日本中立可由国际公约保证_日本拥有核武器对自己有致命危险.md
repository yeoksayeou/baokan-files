Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: The Soviet magazine "International Life" in its May issue published Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev's answers to questions posed to him by Ryosuke Honda, executive director of "Japan Press." In his answers, Khrushchev said that establishing peace zones, especially nuclear-weapon-free zones, in Asia would help ease international tensions in the region.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union is willing to actively participate in measures conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and Pacific region. The Soviet Union is willing to conclude bilateral treaties of friendship and neutrality with all countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people advocate developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with the Japanese people. The Soviet Union does not, and does not want to, threaten Japan with nuclear weapons or any other weapons.

Khrushchev emphasized that Japan's possession of American or "its own" atomic and hydrogen weapons is a fatal danger to Japan. Japan has a high population density and a small territory. If anyone attempts to use nuclear weapons from Japanese territory, it is not difficult to imagine what the retaliation from modern weapons would mean for Japan.

Khrushchev said that only by abolishing foreign military bases in Japan and withdrawing all foreign troops from Japan, only by Japan's refusal to deploy foreign or "its own" atomic and hydrogen weapons on its territory and by pursuing a neutral policy, will Japan achieve peace and security.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is willing to guarantee that Japan's permanent neutrality is respected and observed. Concluding a treaty of peace and friendship involving the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the United States could serve as a form of guaranteeing Japan's neutrality, and other countries in Asia and the Far East could also participate in this treaty.

Khrushchev supported the proposal to convene an international conference to discuss peace and security in the Far East and Pacific region.

    赫鲁晓夫答“日本新闻社”专务理事
    日本中立可由国际公约保证
    日本拥有核武器对自己有致命危险
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“国际生活”杂志五月号发表了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对“日本新闻社”专务理事本田良介向他提出的一些问题的答复。赫鲁晓夫在答问中说，在亚洲地区建立和平地区、首先是建立无核武器地区，会有助于这个地区的国际紧张局势的缓和。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联愿意积极参加有助于维护和巩固远东及太平洋区域的和平的措施。苏联愿意同远东和东南亚的一切国家缔结双边的友好和中立条约。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民主张同日本人民发展睦邻友好的关系。苏联没有、而且也不想用核武器或者什么其他武器威胁日本。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，日本拥有美国的或日本“自己”的原子武器和氢武器，这对日本有着致命的危险。日本人口密度大而领土较小，如果有人从日本领土上作任何使用核武器的尝试，那末，现代武器给日本的回击会意味着什么，这是不难设想的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，只有取消日本境内的外国军事基地并从日本撤出一切外国军队，只有日本拒绝在它的领土上配置外国的或“自己”的原子武器和氢武器并且实行中立政策，才会给日本带来和平和安全。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联愿意保障日本的永久中立地位得到尊重和遵守。缔结一项由苏联、中华人民共和国、日本和美国参加的和平友好公约，可以作为保证日本中立的一种形式，亚洲和远东的其他国家也可以参加这项公约。
    赫鲁晓夫支持召开国际会议来讨论远东及太平洋区域的和平和安全问题的主张。
