Xinhua News Agency, May 12th:

    The delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Dieckmann, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, and First Deputy Chairman Matern, left Beijing by jet plane this morning to return home after concluding its friendly visit to our country.

    First Deputy Chairman Matern said at the Capital Airport that during our trip to the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries in Asia, we clearly realized that the people of the German Democratic Republic are not isolated in their struggle for a just solution to the vital national issue of the country's reunification.  The millions upon millions of people in the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, stand united in support of the German people's demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys. This is an encouragement to us and makes it our duty to redouble our efforts and fight.

    Matern also said with deep feeling that as we leave you, we fully understand that 10,000 kilometers away from our country, we have a loyal and reliable ally - the Chinese people, who stand with us like brothers in our struggle.

    Before Matern's speech, Chairman Zhu De delivered a farewell speech. He said that although we are about to part temporarily, the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and our common cause will forever closely link the people of our two countries together. Our fraternal unity and cooperation will become closer and closer, and we will advance hand in hand forever. Chairman Zhu De said that the delegation's visit is a great encouragement to the people of our country and has made a valuable contribution to further developing the fraternal cooperative relationship between the people of China and Germany.

    At the airport, where the national flags of China and Germany were flying, Chairman Dieckmann, First Deputy Chairman Matern, and other distinguished guests warmly shook hands and said goodbye to Li Jishen, Peng Zhen, and Lin Feng, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice-Premiers of the State Council Nie Rongzhen and Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Shutong, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and others who came to see them off, and accepted bouquets presented by a group of young women.

    Also present at the airport to see them off were the heads of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, leading members of democratic parties, people's organizations, and the Sino-German Friendship Association, Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, Korean Ambassador to China Li Yong-ho, Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Tu Binh, Mongolian Ambassador to China Luvsan, and officials from the Indian and Ceylonese Embassies in China.

    Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Daier, was at the airport to see them off.

    At eight o'clock, as the special plane took off into the bright sunshine, Chairman Zhu De and the people who came to see them off waved goodbye again and again, wishing the distinguished guests a safe journey. (Attached pictures)

    德人民议院代表团离京回国
    马特恩说：我们有着忠实可靠的同盟者——中国人民
    新华社12日讯  以德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、第一副主席马特恩为首的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团，在结束了对我国的友好访问以后，今天上午乘喷气式飞机离开北京回国。
    马特恩第一副主席在首都机场上讲话说，我们这次在中华人民共和国和亚洲其他社会主义国家的旅行中清楚地体会到，德意志民主共和国人民在为公正地解决祖国统一的民族切身问题的斗争中，并不孤立。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营千千万万群众，团结一致地支持德国人民关于同两个德国缔结和约的要求。这对我们是一种鼓舞，并且使我们有责任加倍努力，进行斗争。
    马特恩还情意深长地说，在离开你们的时候，我们心里完全明白，在距离我们祖国一万公里的地方，我们有着忠实可靠的同盟者——中国人民，在我们的斗争中，他们兄弟般地和我们站在一起。
    在马特恩讲话前，朱德委员长致欢送词。他说，我们虽然就要暂时分别了，但是马克思列宁主义的伟大思想和共同事业，却把我们两国人民永远紧密地联结在一起。我们的兄弟团结和合作关系将愈来愈加亲密，我们将永远携手前进。朱德委员长说，代表团的这次访问，对于我国人民是一个很大的鼓舞，并且对于进一步发展中德两国人民的兄弟合作关系作出了宝贵的贡献。
    在飘扬着中德两国国旗的机场上，狄克曼主席、马特恩第一副主席和其他贵宾们，同前来送行的人大常委会副委员长李济深、彭真、林枫，国务院副总理聂荣臻、习仲勋，政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等一一亲切握手告别，并且接受了一群女青年的献花。
    到机场送行的，还有最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的负责人，民主党派、人民团体以及中德友好协会的负责人，苏联驻华大使尤金，朝鲜驻华大使李永镐，越南驻华大使陈子平，蒙古驻华大使鲁布桑以及印度、锡兰驻华大使馆的官员。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔到机场送行。
    八时，当专机迎着灿烂的阳光起飞时，朱德委员长和欢送的人们一再挥手致意，祝贵宾们一路平安。（附图片）
