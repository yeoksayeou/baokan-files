Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 26th: Many factories in Shanghai, during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, have adopted a two-pronged approach of technological innovation and strengthened enterprise management, resulting in a general improvement in product quality. In some factories where product quality was previously low, the product qualification rate has soared from 70%-80% to over 95%.

The work of improving product quality in Shanghai factories and enterprises began at the end of April. Some factories that previously neglected product quality, after mobilizing the masses for extensive airing of views, holding debates, spot-checking products, visiting users, and holding quality exhibitions, have given the vast number of workers and cadres a profound education in the spirit of the General Line, establishing a comprehensive view of achieving more, faster, better, and more economically.

"Can high output be combined with high quality?" was one of the most hotly debated issues in the discussions in various factories. Through debate, everyone clarified that vigorously engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution is the main way to achieve both high output and high quality. During this period, many factories adopted the "three-in-one" method of combining leadership, workers, and technicians, and made many reforms in operating techniques and equipment. Enterprise leaders went deep into the key production areas and weak links in quality. The Party Branch Secretary and factory director of the China Electric Factory, as well as the directors of various workshops, went deep into key workshops, work sections, and groups to cultivate "experimental plots" and work alongside the workers. Focusing on key issues in product quality, they organized workers and technicians to experiment with new formulas and improve equipment, resulting in rapid improvements in quality. By May 23rd, the Chengfu Iron Factory had already implemented more than 100 technological innovation measures that could ensure both high output and high quality. In the past, the oil pump eyes processed by the first group of the second workshop were sometimes not smooth, and sometimes the sizes were inconsistent. They improved tools, equipment, and operations, hardened the cutting tools, sped up the lathe speed, and reduced the feed rate and depth of cut, quickly achieving a qualification rate of 99.99%, and also increasing output by 40%. A few factories, such as the Shanghai Doll Factory (a toy factory), had low product quality to begin with, and their output decreased when they focused on quality this time. The factory workers then improved operational techniques and strengthened management to achieve a double leap in both quality and output.

Many factories have also used technological innovation and technological revolution to overcome the difficulties of poor raw material quality affecting product quality. After the Jin'gang Rubber Factory switched to using lower-quality crepe rubber, the wear resistance of sneakers temporarily decreased. Could high-quality sneakers be made with crepe rubber? At that time, there were two different views among the workers. Some people said: "If you want high quality, you can only use smoked sheet rubber (high-quality rubber)!" But most workers believed that as long as they actively sought solutions, this difficulty could be overcome. The factory leaders, technicians, and workers worked together to repeatedly conduct various experiments, and finally developed a formula and operating method suitable for the performance of crepe rubber. The wear resistance of the sneakers produced was greatly improved, basically reaching the level when using high-quality rubber.

In the work of improving quality, many factories have implemented the principle of combining vigorous mass movements with strengthened enterprise management. While mobilizing the masses to air their views and conduct debates, and conducting in-depth investigations into quality issues, they comprehensively checked and rectified the rules and regulations related to ensuring quality, and quickly reversed some chaotic management phenomena. The rules and regulations established and improved by various factories focused on both "prevention" and "post-event inspection." On the one hand, they established or supplemented and revised process regulations and established a responsibility system to prevent the production of defective products; on the other hand, they established and improved a series of inspection systems from the entry of raw materials into the factory, the production of parts and components, to the delivery of products from the factory. The new inspection system not only widely absorbed the opinions of the workers when it was established; but also adopted a combination of self-inspection by production workers, mutual inspection by relevant workers, and inspection by full-time personnel in the inspection methods, jointly "guarding the gate" and everyone "guarding the gate". Therefore, after these rules and regulations were established and improved, the workers were able to conscientiously implement them, which played a significant role in ensuring product quality.

    树立多快好省全面观点
    上海许多工厂职工大鸣大放产品质量迅速提高
    新华社上海26日电  上海市许多工厂在增产节约运动中，采取革新技术和加强企业管理双管齐下的办法，使产品质量普遍提高。一部分原来产品质量较低的工厂，产品的合格率已从70％到80％猛升到95％以上。
    上海市工厂企业这次进行的提高产品质量的工作，是从4月底开始的。一些过去忽视产品质量的工厂，经过普遍发动群众大鸣大放，举行辩论会，抽查产品，访问用户，举办质量展览会等方式，使广大职工和干部受到一次深刻的总路线的思想教育，树立了多快好省的全面观点。
    “高产能不能优质？”是各厂这次讨论中争辩得最热烈的问题之一。通过争辩，大家明确了大搞技术革新和技术革命，是做到既高产又优质的主要途径。这一时期，很多工厂都采用领导人员、工人和技术人员三结合的方法，作了很多操作技术和设备上的改革。哪里是生产的关键，哪里是质量的薄弱环节，企业领导人员就深入到哪里。中国电工厂的党总支书记、厂长和各个车间的主任，都深入到重点的车间、工段和小组大种试验田，跟班劳动。他们围绕着产品质量关键问题，组织工人、技术人员试验新的配方，改进设备，使质量迅速提高。诚孚铁工厂5月份到23日止，已经实现了一百多项既能保证高产又能保证优质的技术革新措施。二车间第一小组过去加工的油泵眼有的不光滑，有的大小不一致。他们改进了工具、设备和操作，把刀子淬得硬些，放快了车速，缩小了走刀量和进刀量，合格率很快达到了99.99％，产量也提高了40％。少数工厂如上海娃娃厂（制造玩具的厂）等，原来产品质量低，这次抓了质量，产量又下降了。工厂职工们就通过改进操作技术、加强管理工作，来使质量产量双跃进。
    很多厂还运用大搞技术革新和技术革命的办法，克服了某些原材料质量不好影响产品质量的困难。金刚橡胶厂改用质量较差的绉片胶以后，球鞋的耐磨性能曾一度下降。能不能用绉片胶做出质量好的球鞋来？当时职工中有两种不同的看法。有人说：“若要质量高，只有烟片胶（质量好的橡胶）！”但大部分职工认为，只要积极想办法，这个困难是可以克服的。这个厂的领导人和技术人员、工人们一起，反复进行各种不同的试验，终于研究出了适合绉片胶性能的配方和操作方法，做出的球鞋耐磨性能大大提高，基本上达到原来用优质胶生产时的水平。
    许多工厂在提高质量的工作中，都贯彻了大搞群众运动和加强企业管理相结合的原则。它们在发动群众鸣放辩论和深入调查质量问题时，全面地检查和整顿了有关保证质量方面的规章制度，迅速扭转了某些管理上的混乱现象。各厂建立和健全的规章制度，重点都放在“预防”和“事后检查”两个方面。一面建立或补充修订了工艺规程，建立责任制度，预防产生废次品；一面建立和健全了从原材料进厂、零件部件生产到产品出厂一系列的检验制度。新的检验制度，不但在建立时广泛地吸收了工人群众的意见；在检查方法上也是采取生产工人自行检查、有关工人互相检查和专职人员检查相结合的办法，共同“把关”、人人“把关”。因此这些规章制度建立和健全后，工人们都能认真执行，对保证产品质量起了很大的作用。
