Performance of Moliere's Masterpiece "The Miser"
    Feng Zi
    Living in the capital Beijing, the curtain opens in an instant, and we seem to be transported to a European country in the 17th century. The stage image shaped by the world comedy master Moliere's masterpiece "The Miser" helps us understand the social landscape of that era. Although separated by about three hundred years in time and a vast ocean in space, everything that happens there is not unfamiliar to us. The protagonist, Harpagon, also seems quite familiar to us. His typical image of extreme selfishness and avarice profoundly exposes the class nature of the feudal and bourgeois classes. Under the leadership of the Party, we have just overthrown the feudal landlord class with our own hands and peacefully transformed the bourgeoisie. It has only been ten years since our country transitioned from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society to today's socialist society, so we naturally feel a sense of familiarity with Harpagon.
    The reason why the play "The Miser" is a model of world masterpieces is mainly because it created such a typical character as Harpagon. To what extent is the miser's stinginess? As La Flèche in the play says, "The word 'gift' is so abhorrent to him that he never says 'I give you a good morning,' but rather says, 'I lend you a good morning.'" Of course, we know this character more from his actions. For example, when Harpagon and his son are arguing endlessly over Mariane, the honest and muddleheaded Master Jacques enthusiastically mediates for them. Harpagon is so happy that he says he will reward this good cook while reaching into his pocket. At this time, Jacques is flattered and reaches out his hand to wait for the reward, but instead watches Harpagon take out a handkerchief to blow his nose. This is just a small action of the character, but this small action is like a microscope that allows us to see through the depths of this character's soul.
    Of course, the play's portrayal of this character is not just a few strokes, it can be said to be vividly portrayed. From the suspicion of La Flèche at the beginning; discussing marriage issues with his children, forcing his daughter to marry Lord Anselme, arranging banquets, all the way to losing the box containing ten thousand gold coins, mourning and wailing as if his parents had died… these events all occur and develop through the actions of Harpagon and the people around him. The plot arranged from the relationship between the characters, including some details, can be said to be meticulously arranged. Of course, there would be no story without coincidence, especially since this is a comedy, which requires a high degree of exaggeration. The exaggeration technique of "The Miser" reaches the peak of art. The exaggeration starts from the characters, and the exaggeration does not deviate from the character's prescribed situation, so the more exaggerated it is, the more real it feels. For example, Master Jacques, who doesn't have many scenes, is loyal to his master. He mediates the conflict between father and son and reflects people's opinions to the master. Can't his motives and methods be said to come from good intentions? But he is the one who gets beaten, and he is also the first to be investigated. Isn't Jacques a typical example of so-called honest people in that kind of society? The author uses Jacques' mouth to say a poignant sentence: "What am I supposed to do to be good? Because I get beaten for telling the truth, and if I lie, they will hang me!" This character not only plays an important interludial role in the play, but through this character, we see the essence of class society and recognize what is called truth and right and wrong in class society. Therefore, his beating and his lying, although obviously exaggerated, feel real.
    Thank you to the performing artists of the Beijing People's Art Theater for allowing us to reread the play through stage art images. The more I read it, the more I feel it is a good play. The audience's laughter is not the only criterion for measuring the performance effect, but it is also worth pondering for the performers if no one laughs while performing a comedy. But from the performance effect of Beijing Renyi, it seems normal. It seems that the director has put in some effort and made some attempts, and has also achieved certain results. Especially in the mastery of rhythm, it can highlight the climax. The speed of comedy should be faster, but the speed must also have rhythm, and it must gradually reach the climax. It is also very natural to use servants to enter and exit as well as pick up props. I don’t know if it has ever happened in foreign countries, but after the reform of local operas, we have become accustomed to having extras or characters with few scenes also pick up props. "The Miser" is also very harmonious in this respect, combining ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign.
    The image of Harpagon created by Tian Chong is credible. It can be seen that the actor has experienced and mastered the character's thoughts and feelings, rather than coldly criticizing the character, thus making the audience believe in the existence of this typical character who loves money like his life. Experiencing the character rather than coldly criticizing the character is probably a key issue in how to create a character to be criticized. Undoubtedly, Harpagon is criticized. His criticism is the result of the actor's artistic expression. The right to criticize him should belong to the audience, not the actor himself. Another character that people believe in is Master Jacques created by Zhu Xu. The actor did not act in the direction of honesty and muddleheadedness for such an honest and muddleheaded person. As a character, he would think he is smart and capable. Since he was beaten for being honest, then learn to be good, and then cleverly tell a lie. Who knows, "lying will also lead to the gallows?" There is a contradiction between subjective desire and objective effect, and the humor lies here.
    Some roles have created very brilliant images, such as Zhou Zheng's Valère, Hu Zongwen's Mariane, and Liang Jing's Frosine. However, some characters seem to be lacking something. For example, Valère gives the audience a very good impression. He is a noble young man who has to play the role of a servant for the sake of Élise and has to flatter Harpagon. His flattery is acting, false play has to be done realistically, and there is falsehood in truth. That amount and proportion needs to be grasped. Harpagon asked him to persuade Élise to marry Anselme. All the positive flattery of Harpagon is essentially a satire of Harpagon and the class society represented by Harpagon. The emotions of this scene and the last scene where he confesses his love for Élise in front of the investigator should be different. It is the same to talk eloquently, but the way of expression does not seem to change much. Hu Zongwen showed the dignified, virtuous, gentle, and melancholy side of Mariane. The actor's analysis of the character is undoubtedly correct; however, Mariane is still a girl, and is in love with Cléante, so in addition to being dignified, virtuous, gentle, and melancholy, there should also be the innocence and coquettishness of a girl in love. This may be the main reason why the audience feels that Mariane gives the first impression of being an adult woman?
    If the understanding of the characters is not comprehensive enough and the character images are not full enough, it will inevitably weaken the comic effect that should be there. Yan Zanyao's La Flèche is strictly speaking derelict in his duties. The actor seems too honest, just reciting the words without touching the person. The two scenes of being searched by Harpagon and reading the list of creditors did not achieve the desired effect. Although he is an interludial character, he plays a decisive role. From being scolded by Harpagon to stealing the box, the character's mood and behavior are logical, and the contradiction between him and the old master indirectly pushes the whole play to a climax. The director's choice of role seems to be inappropriate for this character.
    In general, the performance style is not very unified. Tian Chong, Zhu Xu, and Liang Jing are acting in comedy, while some actors seem to be acting in serious drama.
    It is very difficult to rehearse such a classic masterpiece. It is not appropriate and we cannot demand too much if there is not enough understanding of the social life at that time and place. Here, we are only discussing the play and talking about the characters, and incidentally mentioning some personal superficial views. What should be affirmed is that the performance of "The Miser" has enriched our stage art and also enriched our cultural life. Drama art can be exercised and improved through the performance of masterpieces, and at the same time meets the needs of the audience.
    The problem that follows the performance of world masterpieces is the translation work of drama literature. How can the foreign words and the language of ancient characters conform to our spoken language? It is a new problem to both maintain its characteristics of the times and be accepted by our broad masses of people. Comrade Zhao Shaohou's translation can be said to have basically solved these problems, and this is a very good translation. It would be even smoother if some foreign grammar were further Sinicized.
    Finally, I would like to make a small suggestion. The word "miser" is extremely unpopular. Why not change it to "treasure-watcher" or "someone who loves money like their life"?

    莫里哀名著“悭吝人”的演出
    凤子
    我们生活在首都北京，片刻间，帷幕拉开，我们却似乎被带进了十七世纪的欧洲国家。世界喜剧大师莫里哀的名著“悭吝人”中所塑造的舞台形象，帮助我们理解了那个时代的社会面貌。时间上相距约三百年，空间隔了大洋大洲的地方发生的这一切，对我们说来并不陌生，剧中主人翁阿巴公这个人物，我们看来也相当熟悉，他那极端自私自利、视钱如命的典型形象深刻地暴露了封建的和资产阶级的阶级本质。我们在党的领导下，刚刚亲手推翻了封建地主阶级，又和平改造了资产阶级，我们国家从半封建半殖民地社会过渡到今天的社会主义社会也才不过十年，对阿巴公这个人物自然会感到似曾相识了。
    剧本“悭吝人”所以是世界名著的典范，可以说主要是创造了这样一个典型人物阿巴公。悭吝人的吝啬劲儿到了什么程度？剧中人拉弗赉史说的好：“赠送是那么让他嫌恶的字眼，以至他从来不说：‘我赠你一个早安’，而是说：‘我借给你一个早安’。”当然我们认识这个人物更多的是从人物的行动得来的，例如阿巴公和儿子争夺玛丽亚娜吵之不休的时候，老实而又胡涂的雅克大师傅热心地给他们调解，阿巴公高兴得一边说要奖励这个好厨子，一边掏口袋，这时候，雅克受宠若惊地伸手等待赏赐，结果却看着阿巴公掏出手绢擤鼻涕。这只是人物的一个微小的动作，这个微小的动作像个显微镜似地使我们看透了这个人物的灵魂深处。
    剧本对这个人物的刻划当然不只是这么几笔，可以说是描写得淋漓尽致的。从一出场怀疑拉弗赉史起；同儿女谈婚姻问题，逼女儿嫁给昂赛末老爷，布置请客，一直到丢失了装有万元金币的箱子，如丧考妣地伤心恸哭……这么些事件都是通过阿巴公和他周围的人的行动发生发展的。从人物关系安排的情节，包括一些细节，安排的可说是细针密缝。当然，无巧不成书，何况这是喜剧哩，更需要高度的夸张。“悭吝人”的夸张手法，达到艺术的高峰，夸张是从人物出发的，夸张没有脱离人物的规定情景，因而越夸张越令人感到真实。例如戏并不太多的雅克大师傅，雅克对主人可说是忠心耿耿，他调解父子的矛盾，向老爷反映人们的议论，从动机到方法能说不是出自好心么？可是挨屁股的是他，第一个被调查的也是他，雅克这个人物不就是那样的社会里所谓老实人的典型吗？作者借雅克的嘴说了句一针见血的话：“我到是该怎么行事才算好呢？因为说实话挨了一顿棍子，撒谎么，他们又要绞死我！”这个人物不但在戏里起了重要的穿插作用，通过这个人物我们看到了阶级社会的本质，认识到阶级社会里什么叫做真理，和是非。因此他的挨打、他的撒谎，明明是夸张，却感到真实。
    感谢北京人民艺术剧院表演艺术家们的劳动，使我们通过舞台艺术形象重读了剧本。愈读愈觉得这是个好剧本。观众的笑声不是测量演出效果的唯一准绳，不过，演喜剧而没有人笑却也值得演出者思索的了。但从北京人艺的演出效果来看是正常的。看来导演花了些苦心，作了些尝试，也收到一定的效果。特别在节奏掌握上，能够突出高潮。喜剧的速度要快些，但快也要有节奏，也要逐渐的达到高潮。利用仆人上场兼导具捡场，也非常自然，外国是否有过不知道，地方戏曲改革以后，由龙套或戏少的角色兼捡场我们已经习惯了。“悭吝人”在这一点上古今中外揉在一起到也很调合。
    阿巴公这个人物田冲创造的形象是可信的，看出演员体验了并掌握了角色的思想、感情，而不是冷静地在批判角色，因而使观众相信了这个爱钱如命的典型人物的存在。体验角色而不是冷静地在批判角色，恐怕是如何创造被批判的人物的一个关键性问题。无疑的阿巴公是被批判的，他之被批判是演员艺术表现的后果，批判他的权利应该属于观众，而不应该是演员自己。另一个使人相信的人物是朱旭创造的雅克大师傅，那么一个老实而又胡涂的人，演员并未朝老实、胡涂方面演，作为人物会自以为聪明、能干，既然在诚实上挨了屁股，那就学个乖吧，又自作聪明的撒了一个谎，谁知“撒谎还要上绞架呢？”主观愿望和客观效果是有矛盾的，可笑也就在这里。
    有些角色创造的形象都很光彩，如周正的瓦赖尔，胡宗温的玛丽亚娜，梁菁的福劳辛。不过，有的人物似乎还缺少点什么，如瓦赖尔，给了观众很好的印象，他是个贵公子，为了爱丽丝，不得不扮演侍从的角色，不得不奉承阿巴公，他的奉承就是演戏，假戏要真做，真中也有假，那分量分寸需要掌握。阿巴公叫他说服爱丽丝嫁给昂赛末，所有正面奉承阿巴公的话实质是讽刺阿巴公和阿巴公所代表的阶级社会。这一场和最后在调查员面前承认和爱丽丝的爱情那一场人物的感情应该有所不同。同样是侃侃而谈，而表现的方式似乎变化不大。胡宗温表现了玛丽亚娜的庄重、贤淑、文静的一面，演员对人物的分析无疑是正确的；可是玛丽亚娜究竟还是个女孩子，正在热恋着克雷央特，因此在庄重、贤淑、文静、忧愁之外，应该有正在热恋中的女孩的天真和爱娇。这也许是使观众感到玛丽亚娜给人第一个印象像成年妇人的主要原因吧？
    对人物理解的不够全面，人物形象创造的不够丰满，必然会削弱喜剧应有的效果，覃赞耀的拉弗赉史严格的说是未尽到职的。演员看来太老实，只是念出了词而未触摸到人。被阿巴公搜身、念债权人的清单这两场戏都未达到应有的效果，他虽是个穿插人物，却起着决定性的作用，从挨阿巴公的骂到偷箱子，人物的心情、行为是合乎逻辑的，他和老主人间的矛盾间接地把全剧推向高潮。导演对角色的选择上，这个人物似乎是不太恰当。
    总的看来，表演风格不是很统一的，田冲、朱旭、梁菁是在演喜剧，有的演员却像是在演正剧。
    排演这样一个古典名著是有许多许多困难的，对当时当地社会生活的不够了解，观众不应该，也不能提出苛责，这里只是就戏论戏，就人物谈人物，顺笔提了点个人粗浅的看法。应该肯定的是“悭吝人”的演出丰富了我们的舞台艺术，也丰富了我们的文化生活。话剧艺术可以通过名著的演出得到锻炼和提高，同时也满足了观众的需要。
    演出世界名著跟随而来的问题是剧本文学的翻译工作，外国话，古代人物的语言，如何合乎我们的口语？既要保持它的时代的特征而又能为我们广大人民所能接受，这些是新问题。这些问题赵少侯同志的译文基本上可说是解决了，这是个很好的译本。假如有些外国文法再中国化一下那就更顺当了。
    最后提一个小建议，“悭吝人”这个词极不通俗，何不改为“看财奴”或是“爱钱如命的人”？
