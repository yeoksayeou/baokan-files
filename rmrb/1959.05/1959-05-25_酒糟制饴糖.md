    Making Maltose Syrup from Distillers' Grains
    The sugar workshop of the state-owned Wuhan No. 2 Rice Mill has successfully experimented with using distillers' grains instead of grain to produce maltose syrup. According to the results of two experiments, every 100 jin of distillers' grains can produce 32 jin of maltose syrup. The factory has now officially adopted the use of distillers' grains to produce maltose syrup.
