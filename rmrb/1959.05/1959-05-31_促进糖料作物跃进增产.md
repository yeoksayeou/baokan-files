Promoting a Great Leap Forward in Sugar Crop Production
*People's Daily* Commentator

With the continuous improvement of the people's living standards, the people's demand for sugar is increasing day by day.

Sugar, in the old society, was a regular consumer product for a few people, and only became a daily food for the vast majority of people after liberation. In 1958, the national consumption of sugar increased by 4.2 times compared with 1949. In order to further meet the needs of the people, the state plans to increase sugar production by more than 66% this year compared to last year.

To increase sugar production, it is first necessary to have a large quantity of high-quality raw materials. China is uniquely endowed with both sugarcane and sugar beet, these two sugar crops. Since liberation, thanks to a series of pro-production policies adopted by the Party and the government, the cultivated area and yield of sugar crops have grown rapidly. Especially in the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, the total output of sugarcane reached 270 million dan, 5.1 times that of 1949, and the total output of sugar beet reached 58 million dan, 15.2 times that of 1949. This year's sugar production will continue to make a great leap forward. This year's national economic plan stipulates that sugarcane production will reach 400 million dan, an increase of 48% over 1958; sugar beet production will reach 110 million dan, an increase of 90% over 1958. Vigorously increasing the production of sugar crops and ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of sugar targets is a glorious and important task for farmers and cadres in sugar-producing areas.

The spring sowing of sugar crops in various regions has been better this year than in previous years: in the main sugar beet producing areas of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions, the sowing quality has been greatly improved compared with previous years, and the sowing period has generally been advanced by about a week compared with previous years; the area of deep plowing and application of base fertilizer has been greatly expanded compared with last year. In sugarcane producing areas, the area of improved varieties has also increased by 85% compared with last year. New intensive planting techniques such as expanding the sowing width have also been promoted. These are all favorable factors for large-scale high yields. However, it is still an arduous task to fulfill and overfulfill this year's sugar crop production increase targets. Although the planting area of ​​sugarcane and sugar beet has increased somewhat this year compared with last year, there is still some distance from the original plan. This requires carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement for sugar crops on the basis of universally strengthening field management, and further increasing the yield per unit area to ensure the completion of this year's sugar production increase plan. The key to increasing the yield per unit area lies in strengthening the field management work in the next two or three months.

This year, the area of ​​ratoon sugarcane in the main sugarcane areas is very large, and the yield of ratoon sugarcane is crucial to the growth of the total sugarcane output. At present, we should concentrate our efforts on storming the management of ratoon sugarcane. Guangxi, Guangdong and other places are stepping up the work of digging up dense areas and supplementing sparse areas. This is very necessary. Sugarcane leaves are large and the stems are heavy, and they especially need plenty of fertilizer and water. We should try every means to apply more fertilizer to sugarcane. Some areas have a good method of applying liquid fertilizer to sugarcane and should be promoted. Secondly, insect pests pose a great threat to sugarcane production. Last year, the work of cleaning sugarcane fields in some areas was not meticulous enough, and pests such as sugarcane borers and sugarcane aphids will be more rampant. Carrying out pest control work is also urgent.

"Seven tenths of the harvest depends on the seedlings" is a characteristic of sugar beet crops. This year, various regions have increased the amount of sowing, reduced the row and plant spacing, disinfected the seeds, and improved the sowing technology, laying a favorable foundation for more and stronger seedlings. However, to truly exert the yield-increasing effect of intensive planting, it is also necessary to follow up with management work such as preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and timely cultivating, weeding, and topdressing. According to Jilin's experience, timely thinning, setting seedlings, and thoroughly controlling insects are important ways to reduce abandoned areas and ensure yields. It is hoped that all sugar beet producing areas will seize the opportunity to do a good job in thinning, checking and supplementing seedlings, and strive to plant one mu, have full seedlings on one mu, and harvest one mu.

There is great potential for increasing the production of sugar crops, and the fundamental guarantee for realizing the production increase plan is to strengthen leadership. There are many types of crops, especially food crops, which account for a large proportion. How to strengthen the field management of food crops without relaxing the field management of economic crops such as sugar crops is an important issue. Neijiang County in Sichuan Province, a famous sugarcane producing area in China, and Kedong County in Heilongjiang Province, which is rich in sugar beet, have comprehensively arranged work according to the growth patterns of various crops, properly divided labor according to agricultural time, and made comprehensive arrangements, which have both focus and prevent looking after one thing and losing another. The problem is well solved.

The quality of the growth of sugar crops during the seedling stage is the basis for the level of yield. Now, the sugar beets in the north have emerged, and the sugarcane in the south is in its early growth stage. This is the decisive season for strengthening field management. All regions must seize the time, rationally arrange labor, and earnestly strengthen field management of sugar crops, and strive for a greater harvest of sugar production.

    促进糖料作物跃进增产
    本报评论员
    随着广大人民生活水平的不断提高，人民对糖的需求量一天比一天增加了。
    糖，在旧社会是少数人经常的消费品，只是在解放后才成为广大人民的日常食品。1958年全国食糖的消费量比1949年增加了四点二倍。为了进一步满足人民的需要，国家计划今年糖产量将比去年增加66％强。
    要增产糖，首先必须有量多质优的原料。我国得天独厚，兼有甘蔗和甜菜这两种糖料作物。解放后，由于党和政府采取了一系列奖励生产的政策，糖料作物的栽培面积和产量都有了迅速增长。特别在大跃进的1958年，甘蔗总产量达到二亿七千万担，为1949年的五点一倍，甜菜总产量达到五千八百万担，为1949年的十五点二倍。今年的糖料生产还要继续大跃进。今年我国国民经济计划中规定：甘蔗产量达到四亿担，比1958年增长48％；甜菜产量达到一亿一千万担，比1958年增长90％。要大力增产糖料作物，保证完成和超额完成糖料指标，是糖料产区农民和干部的一项光荣重大的任务。
    今年各地的糖料作物的春播工作，都做得比往年好：甜菜主要产区黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古等省区，播种质量比往年有很大提高，播种期一般比往年提早了一个星期左右；深翻地和施基肥面积，均比去年扩大得很多。甘蔗产区，今年良种面积也比去年增加了85％。并且推行了扩大播幅等新的密植技术措施。这些都是大面积丰产的有利因素。但是，要完成和超额完成今年糖料增产指标，任务还是很艰巨的。今年甘蔗和甜菜的播种面积虽比去年有所增加，然而比原定计划尚有若干的距离。这就需要在普遍加强田间管理的基础上，开展糖料作物大面积丰产运动，用进一步提高单位面积产量，保证完成今年的糖料增产计划。而提高单位面积产量的关键就在于加强今后二、三个月的田间管理工作。
    今年主要蔗区的宿根蔗面积很大，宿根蔗产量对甘蔗总产量的增长举足轻重。目前应该集中力量突击宿根蔗的管理。广西、广东等地正在加紧进行挖密补稀。这样作是很必要的。甘蔗叶大茎重，特别需要肥多水足，应该想尽一切办法，尽量给甘蔗多上一些肥料。有些地区给甘蔗追施液体肥料的办法很好，应该提倡。其次虫害对甘蔗增产威胁很大，去年有些地方的清理蔗园工作不够细致，蔗螟、蔗蚜等害虫将更猖獗，开展治虫工作也是急不容缓的。
    “苗收七成”是甜菜作物的特点。今年各地增加了播种量，缩小了行株距，种子进行了消毒，改进了播种技术，为苗多苗壮打下了有利的基础，但是要真正发挥密植的增产作用，还在于防治病虫害，和及时中耕、除草、追肥等管理工作紧跟上去。根据吉林的经验，适时间苗、定苗和彻底治虫，是减少废弃面积和保证产量的重要途径。希望各甜菜产区抓紧时机，做好间苗、查苗、补苗，力求种一亩，满苗一亩，收获一亩。
    糖料作物的增产潜力很大，实现增产计划的根本保证是加强领导。农作物的种类很多，尤其是粮食作物的比重很大。怎样能够既加强粮食作物的田间管理，又不放松糖料等经济作物的田间管理是一个重要问题。全国甘蔗著名产区四川省内江县，以及盛产甜菜的黑龙江省克东县，根据各种作物的生长规律，全面布置工作，按农时妥善分工，全面安排，既有重心，又防止了顾此失彼。问题解决得很好。
    糖料作物苗期的生长好坏，是构成产量高低的基础。现在北方的甜菜已经出苗，南方的甘蔗处于生长初期，正是需要加强田间管理的决定性季节，各地要抓紧时间，合理安排劳动力，切实加强对糖料作物的田间管理，力争糖料生产的更大丰收。
