    △ The scallop has many sapphire-like eyes, but it is virtually half-blind, only able to see some vague light and shadows. When its main enemy, the starfish, comes to attack it, the tentacles covering its body undergo a chemical reaction, immediately closing its two shells, spraying out two jets of water, and using the reaction force to escape.
    △ Antarctic penguins have strange eyes to suit the local natural environment. When in the dazzling glare of ice and snow, the pupils of their eyes shrink into a small square hole, but when they dive into the dark depths of the sea, they expand into a large circle again. In the corner of the eye is a transparent membrane. It can be swept across the eyeball at will, secreting mucus to moisten the eyeball, and can also protect the eyeball, preventing damage from the Antarctic winds and seawater.
    △ Horseflies have surprisingly large eyes, composed of many small facets, each of which can only see a part of a thing. Thus, a horsefly's two eyes can simultaneously see seven thousand separate images and transmit these images to the brain. The upper facets of a male horsefly's eyes see bright but rough images of things above it, while the lower facets transmit darker but clearer images to the brain. The light sensitivity of the upper and lower facets of a female horsefly's eyes is not different. But it flies particularly fast, able to catch up with any fast horse. Male horseflies can live by simply sucking nectar and plant sap. But female horseflies need to suck horse blood.

    奇怪的眼睛
    △海扇身上有许多只蓝宝石似的眼睛，但是，它却形同半盲，能看出一些模模糊糊的光影。当它的主要敌人星鱼前来袭击它的时候，它身上复盖的触须便发生一种化学反应，立刻闭上两壳，喷出两条水柱，借反作用的力量逃之夭夭。
    △南极的企鹅为了适宜当地的自然环境，生着一对奇怪的眼睛。当它在耀眼的冰雪的闪光下，眼睛的瞳孔就缩成一个正方形的小孔，但当它潜入深海阴暗处的时候，它又扩张成大圆形。在眼睛的右角，有一片透明的薄膜。它能随意在眼珠上扫动，分泌粘液，润湿眼珠，还能保护眼珠，防止南极的大风和海水的损害。
    △马蝇的眼睛大得惊人，它们由许多小眼面组成，每一个小眼面只能看到一件事物的一部分。这样，一只马蝇的两只眼睛可同时看到七千个各别的形象，并把这些形象传达给大脑。雄马蝇的眼睛上部的一些小眼面看到的是在它的上面的明亮但粗糙的事物形象，而眼睛下部的小眼面传达给大脑的是较暗但是清晰的事物形象。雌马蝇的眼睛上部和下部的小眼面的感光力却没有分别。但飞起来特别快，能够追上任何快马。雄马蝇单吸花蜜和植物的汁就可以生活。但雌马蝇却须要吸马血。
