Xinhua News Agency, 8th - Panchen Erdeni, at the invitation of the Chinese Buddhist Association, presided over a grand sutra transmission ceremony at the Yonghe Temple in Beijing this morning. This ceremony was held to pray for the prosperity and strength of the motherland, national unity, the happiness of the people, and the new life of the Tibetan people.

More than a thousand people, including Living Buddhas, Lamas, monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists, participated in today's sutra transmission ceremony at the Yonghe Temple, including Living Buddhas and Lamas who traveled from afar from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

At 9:00 a.m., when the Panchen Lama arrived in a car in front of the Zhaotai Gate, Kalsang, the abbot of the Yonghe Temple, and others stood in front of the Zhaotai Gate holding Tibetan incense to greet him. Abbot Kalsang presented a Hada to the Panchen Lama.

After the Panchen Lama entered the magnificent Falun Hall, he first paid homage to the statue of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Sect, and then walked to the sutra transmission seat in front of the Tsongkhapa statue. At this time, Living Buddha Kalsang led the Buddhists to bow three times to the Panchen Lama, chant sutras, and offer mandalas and Hadas. Then, the Panchen Lama began to transmit the "Summary of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment" (in Tibetan, "Lamrim Dudon"). During the transmission of the sutra, the Panchen Lama said to the Buddhists listening to the sutra: "The great Communist Party and Chairman Mao have stipulated a correct policy of freedom of religious belief, allowing us to fully enjoy the right to religious freedom. The Communist Party works for the happiness of mankind. Buddhists support the Party and the country's religious policies."

After the Panchen Lama finished transmitting the sutra, the Lamas in the main hall offered "Seven Treasures" to the Panchen Lama amidst chanting praises. The Buddhists lined up to pay homage in front of the Buddha seat and each received the Panchen Lama's head-touching and the red silk "blessing knot" (called "Songdui" in Tibetan).

At the end of the sutra transmission ceremony, the Panchen Lama offered Hadas to some Buddha statues in the Falun Hall, Yongyou Hall, Yonghe Palace, and Tianwang Hall, and sprinkled auspicious highland barley. (Attached picture)

    班禅大师进入金碧辉煌的法轮殿后，先朝拜了黄教创始者宗喀巴的塑像，然后走上宗喀巴像前的传经佛座。这时由噶喇藏活佛率领佛教徒们向班禅大师顶礼三拜，并诵经献曼札和哈达。接着班禅大师便开始传“菩提道次第摄颂”（藏语是“朗任堆登”）经。班禅大师在传经过程中向听经的佛教徒们说：“伟大的共产党、毛主席规定了正确的宗教信仰自由政策，使我们充分享受到宗教信仰自由的权利。共产党为了人类幸福而工作。佛教徒们拥护党和国家的宗教政策。”
    班禅大师传经结束后，大殿里的喇嘛在诵赞声中向班禅大师献“七珍”，佛教徒们列队到佛座前朝拜，并一一接受班禅大师的摸顶和给的红绸“加持结”（藏语称为“松堆”）。
