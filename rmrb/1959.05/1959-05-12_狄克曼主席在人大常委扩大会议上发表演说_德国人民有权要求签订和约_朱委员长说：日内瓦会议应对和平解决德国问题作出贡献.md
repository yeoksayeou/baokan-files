Xinhua News Agency, May 11th: Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, delivered a speech at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress this afternoon at the invitation in which he pointed out: The Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers Conference has the bounden duty to create conditions for convening a summit meeting and for concluding a peace treaty with Germany. All peace-loving people in the world are watching the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference and severely condemn those who attempt to undermine this conference.
    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held an enlarged meeting this afternoon in Huairen Hall, Zhongnanhai, to welcome Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, First Deputy Chairman Materne, and the People's Chamber delegation led by them. At 3 p.m., Chairman Dieckmann, First Deputy Chairman Materne, and other distinguished guests, accompanied by Chairman Zhu De and others, entered the venue. At this time, all 1,200 people in the audience stood up and applauded warmly, expressing their heartfelt respect to the envoys of the people of the German Democratic Republic, who are firmly guarding the western front of the socialist camp.
    After Chairman Zhu De delivered a welcoming speech, Chairman Dieckmann delivered a speech amid thunderous applause. His speech fully expressed the lofty aspiration of the people of the German Democratic Republic to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and their firm will to struggle, and praised the mutual support and deep brotherly friendship between the people of China and Germany in their common struggle.
    Chairman Dieckmann pointed out at the beginning that today—May 11th—is a particularly meaningful day, because today, for the first time, two Germanys are participating in the Foreign Ministers Conference that opened in Geneva on an equal footing. He said that the imperialist countries are conspiring against the German Democratic Republic, but they ultimately cannot prevent the German Democratic Republic from obtaining its due position in this international negotiation.
    Chairman Dieckmann said that the primary task of our entire policy is to strive to ensure that all German people obtain the peace treaty that they have not yet obtained today, fourteen years after the end of Hitler's war. No one in the world can deny that the German people have the right to demand the conclusion of a peace treaty not only morally but also under international law. This right was explicitly stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement by the four victorious powers of World War II.
    Chairman Dieckmann said that the peace-loving workers' and peasants' state on German soil—the German Democratic Republic—has consistently and effectively built socialism and has always made unremitting efforts for the peaceful reunification of Germany. Everything it has done is in complete accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the will of the German people. However, the occupying powers in West Germany have long abandoned the basis of the Potsdam Agreement, subjecting the people of West Germany to the rule of militarists, monopoly capitalists, fascists, and imperialists, which not only disregards the peaceful will of the majority of the German people, but also seriously threatens the peace of Germany, Europe, and the world.
    Dieckmann continued that the majority of the people in all of Germany hope to finally eliminate the abnormal division of Berlin and all of Germany, and hope that Germans can live peacefully and united in the same peaceful and democratic family. The Soviet government's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to eliminate the root causes of continuous harassment by making West Berlin a demilitarized free city, in accordance with the wishes and will of the people of the two Germanys, has received our full support, because they are in line with the interests of our people and help safeguard world peace.
    Chairman Dieckmann said in conclusion that under the leadership of the working class and its party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, all our parties and all democratic forces have achieved great and solid unity, dedicated to defending peace and building socialism. This unity cannot be destroyed by anything or anyone. We are the outpost of the socialist world in Germany and Central Europe, and we are confident that together with our friends in the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries, our great cause will surely be victorious.
    Chairman Dieckmann's speech constantly aroused warm applause from the audience.
    Before Chairman Dieckmann's speech, Chairman Zhu De first delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. In his speech, he reiterated that the Chinese people firmly support the German people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, firmly support the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin, and firmly support the recent solemn position of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the Chinese Foreign Minister Conference on fully promoting East-West talks to contribute to the cause of peace.
    Chairman Zhu De said that the German Democratic Republic is a strong fortress on the western front of the socialist camp. The German Democratic Republic has consistently struggled for the peaceful resolution of the German issue and the reunification of Germany on a democratic basis, and for the consolidation of peace in Europe and the world. This struggle has become an important factor in preventing the imperialist camp headed by the United States from launching a new world war.
    At the end of the meeting, Chairman Zhu De once again delivered a speech, expressing the Chinese people's full support for the German people's just struggle. He said that the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Geneva today should contribute to a peaceful resolution of the German issue. Western countries and the West German authorities are doing their utmost to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the end of the occupation regime in West Berlin, hindering the relaxation of international tensions. The peace-loving countries and people of the world will resolutely oppose their conspiracy. The sacred struggle of the German people to reunify their motherland will surely win the final glorious victory.
    Attending today's meeting were Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, Lin Feng, Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi, Xi Zhongxun, President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai, heads of government departments, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and deputies to the National People's Congress in Beijing, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of democratic parties and people's organizations, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.
    Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Dael, was invited to attend the meeting.
    At today's meeting, Chairman Dieckmann, on behalf of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, presented the National People's Congress with an exquisite bronze statue, which depicts a group of peaceful residents stepping on a shattered atomic bomb. When presenting this gift, Chairman Dieckmann said that this bronze statue symbolizes the unity of the people of all countries in the struggle against atomic war and for peace, as well as the confidence in the victory of the struggle.
    This afternoon, Chairman Dieckmann, First Deputy Chairman Materne, and other distinguished guests also held discussions with the deputies to the National People's Congress in Beijing on issues such as the work of the National People's Congress. (Attached picture)

    狄克曼主席在人大常委扩大会议上发表演说
    德国人民有权要求签订和约
    朱委员长说：日内瓦会议应对和平解决德国问题作出贡献
    新华社11日讯　德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼，今天下午应邀在全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议上发表演说
  （全文见第四版）时指出：日内瓦东西方外长会议义不容辞的任务是为召开最高级会议和为缔结对德和约创造条件。全世界爱好和平的人民都注视着日内瓦外长会议，并且严厉谴责那些企图破坏这个会议的人们。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天下午在中南海怀仁堂举行扩大会议，欢迎德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、第一副主席马特恩和由他们率领的人民议院代表团。三时，狄克曼主席和马特恩第一副主席等贵宾由朱德委员长等陪同，步入会场。这时，全场一千二百多人全体起立，热烈鼓掌，向坚守在社会主义阵营西方前线的德意志民主共和国人民的使者，致以衷心的敬意。
    朱德委员长致欢迎词（全文见第四版）以后，狄克曼主席在雷鸣般的掌声中发表演说。他的演说充分表达了德意志民主共和国人民为争取祖国和平统一的崇高愿望和他们坚强的斗争意志，赞颂了德中两国人民在共同斗争中的相互支持和深厚的兄弟友谊。
    狄克曼主席一开始就指出，今天——5月11日是特别有意义的一天，这就是有两个德国今天第一次以平等地位参加了在日内瓦开幕的外长会议。他说，帝国主义国家阴谋反对德意志民主共和国，但是它们最终还是不能阻挠德意志民主共和国在这一国际谈判中取得应有的地位。
    狄克曼主席说，我们全部政策的首要任务，是致力于在希特勒战争结束十四年后的今天，使全体德国人民得到至今尚未获得的和约。世界上没有任何人能够否认，德国人民不仅在道义上，而且在国际法上有要求签订和约的权利。这个权利是第二次世界大战的四个战胜国在波茨坦协定中明确规定的。
    狄克曼主席说，在德国土地上的和平工农国家——德意志民主共和国，一贯卓有成效地建设社会主义，并且始终为和平统一德国进行了不懈的努力，它所做的一切，完全符合波茨坦协定，也完全符合德国人民的意志。可是，德国西部的占领国早已抛弃波茨坦协定的基础，使西德人民遭受军国主义者、垄断资本家、法西斯分子和帝国主义者的统治，这不仅是无视大多数德国人民的和平意志，而且严重地威胁着德国、欧洲和世界的和平。
    狄克曼接着说，全德国大多数人民都希望最后消除柏林和全德的反常的分裂现象，希望德国人能够和平团结地生活在同一个和平民主的家庭里。苏联政府按照两个德国的人民的愿望和意志，提出缔结对德和约并通过使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市来消除连绵不断的骚扰根源的建议，获得了我们的全力支持，因为它们符合我国人民的利益并有助于保障世界和平。
    狄克曼主席最后说，在工人阶级和它的政党德国统一社会党的领导下，我国所有政党和所有民主力量，实现了伟大和巩固的团结，致力于保卫和平和建设社会主义。这种团结是任何东西和任何人都破坏不了的。我们是社会主义世界在德国和中欧的前哨，我们确信，同苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家朋友在一起，我们的伟大事业必定胜利。
    狄克曼主席的演说，不断地激起全场热烈的掌声。
    在狄克曼主席演说以前朱德委员长在会上首先致欢迎词。他在讲话中重申：中国人民坚决支持德国人民争取和平统一自己祖国的正义斗争，坚决支持苏联、德意志民主共和国就缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度问题所提出的合理建议，坚决支持最近华沙条约缔约国和中国外长会议关于全力促使东西方会谈有助于和平事业的严正立场。
    朱德委员长说，德意志民主共和国是社会主义阵营西方前线的坚强堡垒。德意志民主共和国始终不渝地为和平解决德国问题和在民主的基础上统一全德国，为巩固欧洲和世界和平而斗争。这个斗争，已经成为制止以美国为首的帝国主义阵营发动新的世界大战的阴谋的一个重要的因素。
    会议结束时，朱德委员长再次致词，表示中国人民全力支持德意志人民的正义斗争。他说，今天在日内瓦召开的外长会议，应该对和平解决德国问题作出贡献。西方国家和西德当局竭力阻挠缔结对德和约和结束西柏林的占领制度，阻碍国际紧张局势的和缓。对于他们的这种阴谋，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，必将坚决反对。德意志人民重新统一祖国的神圣的斗争，必将获得最后的光荣胜利。
    参加今天会议的，有全国人民代表大会常委会副委员长李济深、罗荣桓、沈钧儒、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通、程潜、班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞、林枫，国务院副总理陈毅、习仲勋、最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，政府各部门负责人，在京的人大常委、人大代表和政协全国委员会委员，各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，人民解放军高级将领以及首都各界人士。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔应邀参加了会议。
    在今天的会议上，狄克曼主席代表德意志民主共和国人民议院，向全国人民代表大会赠送了一座精致的铜质雕像，这座铜像雕刻着一群和平的居民脚踏着一个被粉碎了的原子弹。狄克曼主席在赠送这个礼品时说，这个铜像象征了各国人民在反对原子战争和争取和平的斗争中的团结一致，以及对于斗争胜利的信心。
    今天下午，狄克曼主席和马特恩第一副主席等贵宾们，还就全国人民代表大会的工作等问题，同在北京的人大代表进行了座谈。（附图片）
