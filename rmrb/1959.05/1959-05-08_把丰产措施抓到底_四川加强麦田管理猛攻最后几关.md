The Sichuan Basin is filled with rolling wheat waves, with over 23 million mu of wheat showing a scene of abundant harvest. Recently, the reporter traveled from Nanchong to Chengdu, and along the six hundred li of highway, everywhere was the same dense and uniform wheat field, it was simply impossible to distinguish between the high-yield fields and the ordinary wheat fields. Farmers who are busy building trellises and applying extra-root fertilizer can only show their heads in the wheat fields. Currently, the wheat in various parts of the province is generally in the stage of grouting and filling grains, and is gradually ripening; by the Jinsha River, where it is like spring all year round, the farmers have already waved their sickles to harvest.

The abundant harvest scene has encouraged farmers in various places, and they have taken out greater efforts to firmly grasp the late-stage field management of wheat: preventing lodging and pests and diseases, applying grouting fertilizer and grain-filling fertilizer, and resolutely implementing high-yield measures to the end. In order to make the wheat ears grow with more grains and fuller grains, Langzhong County mobilized 100,000 people to apply a grouting fertilizer to more than 210,000 mu of wheat within five days, and sorted all types of wheat row by row and plot by plot, prescribing the right medicine, and supplementing whatever was lacking. For example, for those lacking fertilizer, 40 to 50 loads of manure were applied per mu, and for those with dry soil, they were watered in time, ensuring that each field was adequately fertilized and each plot was fully watered. Many communes have established pest and disease forecasting stations, and once discovered, they are immediately extinguished. Nanchong Prefecture has opened training classes for indigenous pesticide production technicians, and planted more than 80,000 mu of poisonous plants such as Ba Dou as raw materials for manufacturing indigenous pesticides, restored and built more than 3,000 pesticide factories, and produced more than 30 million jin of various indigenous pesticides in a short period of time, adapting to the needs of pest and disease control in a timely manner.

　　把丰产措施抓到底
    四川加强麦田管理猛攻最后几关
    本报成都7日电　四川盆地麦浪滚滚，二千三百多万亩小麦呈现一片丰收景象。记者最近从南充到成都，在长达六百多里的公路两边，看见到处都是一样茂密齐整的小麦地，简直无法分别出那是丰产地，那是一般麦地。正在忙着搭架、施根外追肥的农民，仅能在麦地里露出个头来。目前，全省各地小麦一般正在灌浆饱籽，陆续黄熟；四季如春的金沙江边，农民们已经挥镰收割。
    丰收景象鼓舞了各地农民，他们拿出更大干劲，抓紧小麦后期田间管理工作：防治倒伏和病虫害，追施灌浆肥和饱粒肥，坚决把丰产措施贯彻到底。为了使麦穗长得粒多、粒饱，阆中县出动十万人，在五天之内，对二十一万多亩小麦追施了一次灌浆肥，并把各类小麦逐行逐块进行排队，对症下药，缺啥补啥。如对缺肥的，每亩追施四十到五十挑粪，对土壤干燥的，及时浇灌，保证作到田田施足肥、块块喝饱水。许多公社都建立了病虫害测报站，一经发现，立即扑灭。南充专区开办了土农药生产技术员训练班，种植了芭豆等毒草八万多亩作为制造土农药的原料，恢复和新建农药厂三千多个，在短期内已生产各种土农药三千多万斤，及时适应了防治病虫害的需要。
