Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 26th: Bulgarian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense, General Mihailov, held a banquet here on the evening of the 26th to welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai.

General Mihailov and Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke at the banquet successively.

Mihailov said that the firm fraternal friendship, which arose in the struggle against imperialism and foreign oppression, binds the people of China and Bulgaria together. The basis of this friendship is loyalty to proletarian internationalism, loyalty to the common goal of building socialism and communism, and loyalty to the great doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin.

Mihailov said that the visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation is a new manifestation of this friendship between the people of Bulgaria and China and will help to further enhance this friendship.

Marshal Peng Dehuai pointed out in his speech that the delegation was pleased to see during its visit that the hardworking, brave, and revolutionary Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, have built their country into a socialist country with modern industry and agricultural collectivization. The fraternal Bulgarian people have made unremitting efforts to oppose the imperialist policies of war and aggression and safeguard European peace, and have waged a resolute struggle to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism and oppose modern revisionism. The Chinese people are sincerely delighted by the significant victories achieved by the Bulgarian people in these struggles.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Bulgarian People's Army is an army with glorious revolutionary traditions. Today, the Bulgarian People's Army is already a modernized people's army, becoming a strong force for defending the motherland and maintaining European and world peace.

Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese people and army highly respect Comrade Dimitrov, the outstanding proletarian revolutionary and great son of the Bulgarian people.

Peng Dehuai finally pointed out that the Bulgarian government and people have given strong support to China's socialist construction and the struggle against US imperialist aggression. On this occasion, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese government and people.

Present at the banquet were: Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, Ganev; First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Traikov; Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Dimov, and other party and government leaders and generals of the Bulgarian People's Army, as well as more than 300 people including diplomatic envoys and military attaches from some countries.
