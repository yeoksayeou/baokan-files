　　Defending Peace Is the Inherent Duty of Progressive Humanity
    Khrushchev Sends Congratulations to the World Peace Council Special Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th – TASS reported from Moscow on the 8th that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, sent a congratulatory telegram on the 8th to the special meeting of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm.
    The full text of Khrushchev's congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Special Meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm
    On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the peace movement, I would like to extend my heartfelt respects to the participants of the special meeting of the World Peace Council and to all peace fighters they represent.
    The peace movement was formed by the will of the broad masses of the people, reflecting their ardent desire to prevent a new world war and defend peace. This people's movement unites millions of ordinary people, people from all walks of life regardless of political views, religious beliefs, nationality, and race, and inspires them to fight for peace.
    The beneficial activities of the defenders of peace have promoted the struggle to defend peace to become increasingly popular. The peace movement has become an important factor in promoting and strengthening the forces of peace and easing international tensions. This movement, together with all peace-loving forces, has played a significant role in the struggle to defend peace, in which great achievements have been made. The belief that the sacred cause of peace can and needs to be defended through active struggle is becoming increasingly firm in the consciousness of the people of all countries.
    However, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements already made, because the "Cold War" is still continuing, and the imperialist aggressive forces have not stopped preparing for a hot war. In this situation, all those who do not want to become victims of a devastating thermonuclear war, all those who are willing to defend peace for their own and their children's happiness, regard strengthening the struggle against the danger of war as their inherent duty.
    The struggle for peace - this is the struggle of good against evil. To defeat war, to defeat evil, to ensure the victory of good and the victory of the cause of peace - what a great and noble goal! No effort should be spared to achieve this goal.
    I firmly believe that the defenders of peace will unite the strength of the people of all countries with greater enthusiasm and initiative to fight for stopping the "Cold War," ensuring peaceful coexistence among all countries, and for lasting world peace. The unity of all peace-loving forces and their active and concerted action - this is the decisive factor in preventing war and consolidating peace.
    I warmly hope that the World Peace Council, the defenders of peace, and all peace-loving forces in all countries will achieve new and greater successes in the struggle for the sacred rights of a peaceful life for mankind and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.
                          N. Khrushchev
                  May 8, 1959, Moscow

　　保卫和平是进步人类的天职
    赫鲁晓夫电贺世界和理会特别会议
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫8日致电祝贺在斯德哥尔摩召开的世界和平理事会特别会议。
    赫鲁晓夫的贺电全文如下：斯德哥尔摩世界和平理事会特别会议
    值此和平运动十周年之际，谨向世界和平理事会特别会议参加者和他们所代表的全体和平战士致以衷心的敬意。
    和平运动是由于广大人民群众的意志而形成的，反映了他们热烈渴望防止新的世界大战和保卫和平。这个人民运动把千百万普通人，不分政治见解、不分宗教信仰、不分民族和种族的广大社会各界人士团结在一起，并鼓舞他们去为和平而斗争。
    和平捍卫者的有益的活动促使保卫和平的斗争越来越具有全民的规模。和平运动已成为推动、加强和平力量和缓和国际紧张局势的重要因素。这一运动和所有爱好和平的力量在一起，在取得了巨大成就的保卫和平的斗争中起了重大的作用。可以而且需要用积极斗争的方法来保卫神圣的和平事业的信念，在各国人民的意识中越来越牢固了。
    但是，不能满足于已有的成绩，因为“冷战”仍在继续，帝国主义侵略势力并没有停止准备热战。在这种情况下，一切不愿意成为毁灭性的热核战争的牺牲品的人，一切愿意为自己和孩子们的幸福而保卫和平的人，都把加强反对战争危险的斗争看作自己的天职。
    争取和平的斗争——这就是善对恶的斗争。战胜战争，战胜恶，保证善的胜利与和平事业的胜利——这是多么伟大而崇高的目的，为了达到这一目的，不应该吝惜任何精力。
    我坚信，和平捍卫者将以更大的热情和积极性去团结各国人民的力量，为制止“冷战”，保证各国人民和平共处和世界持久和平而斗争。一切爱好和平的力量的团结和他们积极一致的行动——这是防止战争和巩固和平的决定性因素。
    我热烈希望世界和平理事会，和平的捍卫者以及各国一切爱好和平的力量在为争取人类和平生活和各国人民间友好合作的神圣权利的斗争中取得新的、更大的成就。
                          尼·赫鲁晓夫
                  1959年5月8日莫斯科
