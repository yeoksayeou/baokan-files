Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now I would like to introduce some information about the great leap forward in China's shipbuilding industry.

China has a coastline of 12,000 kilometers, and inland waterways currently have over 150,000 kilometers of navigable routes, with over 400,000 kilometers of natural river channels. Most rivers and ports remain ice-free throughout the year, making them very suitable for ship transportation. With the same transportation volume, the infrastructure investment for ships is far less than that of railways and highways, and the transportation cost on coastal and inland trunk lines is also much lower than that of railways. Therefore, countries around the world have been paying great attention to the development of water transportation in recent years.

Since the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in China last year, both trunk line and short-distance transportation have become very strained, and water transport volume has also increased several times or even dozens of times. If we can further pay full attention to the development of water transportation and utilize natural and favorable resources, it will greatly promote industrial and agricultural production. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have paid timely attention to this and have rightly listed transportation as a pioneer. In order to adapt to the ascent of the iron and steel marshal, water transportation must be increased accordingly, and new waterways and a large number of new ships must be opened up, which will promote the great leap forward in the shipbuilding industry.

China's shipbuilding industry has a long history, but during the Chiang Kai-shek era, it often teetered on the brink of collapse. After liberation, the government vigorously supported the shipyards with new construction and expansion. Especially under the brilliant illumination of the general line of building socialism in 1958, the broad masses of ship design departments, shipbuilding departments, and ship-using departments broke down superstitions and went all out, setting off a great leap forward in the shipbuilding industry. Now ships of around 10,000 tons can be built domestically, and shipbuilding technology has also developed greatly, reaching the advanced world level. This year, a large number of ocean-going and coastal freighters, a large number of Yangtze River push-tow vessels, and iron barges will be built to participate in operations, and the shipbuilding in various provinces has also increased significantly. In terms of large ships, the new ship designs and trial manufacturing completed this year will include a 15,000-ton self-unloading coastal coal carrier with a 5,400-horsepower diesel engine, a 13,400-ton ocean-going freighter with a 13,000-horsepower steam turbine, and a 10,000-ton ocean-going freighter with an 8,800-horsepower diesel engine. Except for the 13,400-ton ocean-going freighter, the main engines of the above-mentioned ships are all designed and manufactured in China. In addition, an 18,000-ton oil tanker, a 10,000-ton oil tanker, and a 25,000-horsepower high-parameter steam turbine are being designed. In terms of cutting-edge technology, this year we will manufacture and complete a 4,200-ton coastal freighter with a 3,500-horsepower free-piston gas turbine. The ship's equipment will be fully mechanized, electrified, automated, and remotely controlled. There will also be a Yangtze River push-tow vessel with a 2,650-horsepower free-piston gas turbine. In addition, there will be a hydrofoil passenger ship with a 1,000-horsepower light diesel engine, carrying more than 50 passengers, with a speed of more than 60 kilometers per hour. After completion, it will sail between Nanjing and Wuhan.

Although China's shipyards have considerable strength, the shipbuilding capacity is still far from meeting the needs of China's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. After the liberation of Taiwan, even more ships will be needed. In order to meet the needs of shipbuilding, under the unified plan of the whole country, it is necessary to appropriately build new shipyards and repair shipyards and expand existing ones. Provinces and counties with developed water transport, and even people's communes, should also run their own shipyards, which can both repair and build ships.

At present, the biggest factor affecting the development of China's shipbuilding industry is not the shipbuilding issue, but the engine manufacturing issue, that is, the manufacturing of marine machinery cannot keep up with the needs of shipbuilding. For the past fifty or sixty years, the marine main engines (i.e., the power engines that propel ships forward) manufactured in China have all been low-parameter steam engines. In order to improve the efficiency of marine main engines, it is necessary to adopt modern power machines, namely high-parameter steam turbines (including boilers), exhaust gas turbocharged diesel engines, gas engines, and gas turbines. Marine main engines are different from similar land-based machines in structure. They must be light in weight, occupy a small space, be safe, reliable, and easy to use, and have higher technical requirements. Therefore, it is recommended that the central and local relevant departments establish various marine main engine manufacturing factories to meet the needs of shipbuilding.

Marine reduction gears and clutches are necessary accessories for modern high-speed main engines, but China does not currently have such mechanical manufacturing factories, which creates a big gap in the shipbuilding industry. Therefore, it is necessary for China to immediately establish marine reduction gear and clutch manufacturing factories. Marine auxiliary machines and various motors, water pumps, air pumps, ventilators, refrigerators, steering gears, cargo handling machines, anchor windlasses, etc. all have special properties that are different from land-based machines. It is recommended that China designate appropriate factories within the existing ones to manufacture various marine auxiliary machines separately. As for various marine instruments such as driving equipment, navigation equipment, etc., China should also establish special factories for manufacturing them.

In order to continuously improve ship performance and marine machinery efficiency, it is necessary to strengthen the existing ship science research institutes and marine power research institutes. In terms of ship design, in addition to striving to adopt advanced technology, it is necessary to combine it with the transformation of the vast number of wooden sailing ships to improve their transportation capacity. In terms of shipbuilding technology, it is necessary to continuously study new methods to accelerate ship construction, improve quality, and reduce costs. In terms of shipbuilding materials, it is necessary to study new substitutes to increase the strength of the ship, reduce the weight of the ship, and appropriately pay attention to the aesthetics of the ship.

I have only put forward the above opinions on the existing situation in the development of China's shipbuilding industry, and I believe that the Party and the government will be able to solve them in a timely manner. China's water transportation and shipbuilding technology, like the entire national economy, will achieve greater leaps forward in the future.

### 发展造船工业  张文治代表的发言

    发展造船工业
    张文治代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。现在我就我国造船工业的大跃进介绍一些情况。
    我国海岸线长达一万二千公里，内河现在通航线长达十五万余公里，自然河道四十万多公里，绝大部分河流及港口终年不冻，对于船舶运输非常适宜。在同样运量之下，船舶的基建投资远较铁路公路的为少，沿海及内河干线的运输成本亦远较铁路的为低，因此世界各国近年来对于发展水上运输都十分重视。
    我国自去年工农业生产大跃进以来，不论干线运输与短程运输都十分紧张，水上运输量也几倍几十倍的增长，如果能进一步的充分注意发展水上运输，利用天然有利的资源，将对工农业生产起重大的促进作用。党中央及国务院已及时注意及此，将交通运输列为先行官极为正确。为了适应钢铁元帅的升帐，水上运输须相应的增加，开辟新的航道与大量新的船舶，这样就促进了造船工业的大跃进。
    我国造船工业有很久的历史，但在蒋匪帮时代皆频于倒闭，解放后政府对造船厂大力支持予以新建及扩建，尤以在一九五八年建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，船舶设计部门，造船部门及用船部门的广大群众，破除了迷信，鼓足了干劲，在造船工业方面掀起了一个大跃进。现在万吨左右的船舶皆可自造，在造船技术方面也很发展，达到了世界先进水平。今年将有多数的远洋及沿海货轮，大批的长江顶推轮及铁驳造成参加营运，各省的船舶制造亦大量增加。在大型船舶方面，今年新船的设计并一部分完成试造者将有一万五千吨自卸式沿海煤轮，主机为五千四百马力柴油机，一万三千四百吨远洋货轮，主机为一万三千马力蒸气透平，一万吨远洋货轮，主机为八千八百马力柴油机，以上各轮主机除一万三千四百吨远洋货轮外，皆我国自行设计及制造。此外另有一万八千吨油轮，一万吨油轮及二万五千马力高参数蒸气透平正设计中。在尖端技术方面，今年制造并可完成的将有四千二百吨沿海货轮，主机为三千五百马力自由活塞式燃气轮机，船上设备完全为机械化，电气化，自动化，遥控化；另有长江顶推轮，主机为二千六百五十马力自由活塞式燃气轮机。此外尚有水翼客轮，主机为一千马力轻型柴油机，载客五十余人，速度每小时六十余公里，完成后航行于南京武汉之间。
    我国造船厂虽有相当力量，但按我国工农生产大跃进的需要，造船能力相差尚甚远，台湾解放后则需要的船舶更多。为了适应造船的需要，在全国一盘棋的统一计划下，须要将造船厂及修船厂适当的新建及扩建。各水运发达的省县甚至人民公社，也应自办船厂，既能修船又能造船。
    现在影响我国造船工业的发展最大者当非造船问题而是造机问题，即船用机械的制造跟不上造船的需要。我国制造的船用主机（即推动船舶前进的动力机）五六十年以来皆为低参数蒸汽机。为了提高船用主机的效率，非采用现代化的动力机器不可，即高参数的蒸汽透平（包括锅炉），废气增压柴油机，煤气机以及燃气轮机。船用主机与陆用同类机器构造上不同，它须重量轻占地位小，安全可靠使用方便，技术上要求较高。因此建议中央及地方有关部门分别设立各种船用主机制造工厂，以配合造船的需要。
    船用减速齿轮及离合器为现代高速主机的必需配件，但我国现在尚无此种机械制造工厂，给造船工业一个很大的缺口，因此我国有必要立即建立船用减速齿轮及离合器制造工厂。船用副机和各种电机、水泵，风泵，通风机，冷藏机，舵机，起货机，绞锚机等皆有特殊性能与陆用机器不同，建议我国在已有适当的工厂内，分别指定制造各种船用副机。至于各种船用仪表如驾驶设备、导航设备等我国亦应设专厂制造。
    为了不断的提高船舶性能与船用机械效率，须增强现有的船舶科学研究所及船用动力研究所。在船舶设计方面除力求采用先进技术外，须结合广大木帆船予以改造，提高其运输能力。在造船工艺方面须不断研究新式方法加速船舶建造，提高质量、降低造价。在造船材料方面须研究新的代用品以增加船的强度，减轻船的重量，适当的注意船的美观。
    仅就我国现在造船工业发展中所存在的情况提出以上意见，相信党及政府必能适时的予以解决。我国水上运输及造船技术也和整个国民经济一样，今后将获得更大的跃进。
