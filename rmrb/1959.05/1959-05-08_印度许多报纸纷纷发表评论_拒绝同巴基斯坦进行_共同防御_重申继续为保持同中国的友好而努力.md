    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, dispatch: Many Indian newspapers have recently published articles criticizing the suggestion of a "joint defense" between India and Pakistan, and stating that India will continue to pursue a policy of non-alignment and friendship with China.
    It is reported that Pakistani President Ayub Khan recently told reporters that when India is subjected to "foreign threats," Pakistan and India should cooperate to jointly "defend" the region. Prior to this, he also expressed welcoming India to participate in "joint defense." Pakistani Foreign Minister Qadir openly stated in Karachi on April 23 that the Tibet incident "made it seem possible" to pull India into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and bring it "closer" to Pakistan. Some Pakistani newspapers also took the opportunity to advocate that India and Pakistan jointly "resist foreign aggression."
    At the same time, the American propaganda machine is fanning the flames, sowing discord and undermining Sino-Indian relations, and carrying out anti-China propaganda in the name of promoting Indo-Pakistani relations. The American "Christian Science Monitor" said: The Tibet incident has created "some hope for ending the long-standing and costly disputes between India and Pakistan. These actions should receive all the prudent support that Washington and the Commonwealth can provide."
    Indian Prime Minister Nehru addressed this issue in a speech to the Council of States on May 4 regarding the situation in Tibet. He said, "No matter what happens, we do not intend to enter into a military alliance with any country, and I want to make this very clear." He also said: "I am completely in favor of resolving our disputes with Pakistan and living a normal, friendly, and good-neighborly life. We are working towards this." However, "we do not want a joint defense policy, which is almost another term for some kind of military alliance. Our entire policy has always been against this idea." Nehru also said in the People's House on April 27 that India would not allow "hostile sentiments" to arise between India and China.
    Many Indian newspapers published editorials and articles supporting Prime Minister Nehru's position and condemning the aforementioned purposeful and provocative propaganda by Western countries and Pakistan.
    An article in the Indian weekly "Blitz" said: "Our Western benefactors are frantically dragging India into the Cold War by exploiting the Tibetan tragedy, and the methods they are using are cruel and shameless." The author of the article said that during his visit to the Arab East, he met some American and Pakistani figures who said almost in unison that they expected a major conflict between India and China if the Tibet issue could be dragged on until the end of the year. The author said: India "must, out of historical necessity, pursue a policy of active neutrality and friendship with China, although the developments in Tibet have put great pressure on India's position."
    "The Times of India" believes that "if Qadir (Pakistani Foreign Minister) thinks that India's disagreement with China on the Tibetan issue has changed its (India's) policy of non-involvement in the Cold War, then he is making a serious mistake." The newspaper said, "Moreover, military alliances require a consensus of views on international issues, and such a consensus does not exist between India and Pakistan." The newspaper said that the claim of wanting India to participate in "joint defense" "if not completely dishonest, is also a fantasy."
    The Hindi newspaper "Hindustan Daily" published a commentary saying: "Pakistan has joined a military bloc, while India hopes to stand completely outside such a bloc. As long as this fundamental difference exists between the two countries, it is impossible to conclude a joint defense agreement between the two countries."
    The newspaper said, referring to the fact that "relations between India and China have become tense over the Tibet issue," "Nevertheless, India will not make any changes to its basic foreign policy. India has expressed its commitment to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (Panchsheel), and it cannot abandon them."
    "The Statesman" commented: "Pakistan's argument assumes that India needs to be defended against the Chinese. This is not true. India continues to believe that its relations with China are fundamentally friendly." It also said that Nehru "will continue to strive to maintain friendship with China," "For India, there is no question of abandoning any position."
    "The Indian Express" said in an editorial: "Regardless of the disagreements that have arisen over the Tibetan crisis, it is a subjective wish of Karachi to believe that India and China will break up or go to war. It is equally foolish for military alliance and Cold War advocates to imagine that India will change its deliberately considered policy of non-alignment." It also said, "It is also ridiculous to expect to persuade India to make the same mistake in its foreign policy as Pakistan has done." The newspaper asked, "Is Pakistan really and sincerely hoping to maintain the peace and integrity of this subcontinent?" It said, "If Pakistan had accepted India's repeated non-aggression declarations, the goal of joint defense would actually have been fully achieved." It pointed out that such a declaration would have helped resolve the major disputes between the two countries. The newspaper reminded that "Pakistani leaders do not conceal the fact that their country joined the Baghdad Pact and accepted American military aid in order to wage war against India and to seize Kashmir by force."
    "Hindustan Standard" said in an editorial that no one should think that "China's actions in Tibet may lead this country (India) to deviate from the path of strict neutrality and form any kind of alliance with the Western bloc."
    The newspaper's editorial also said that "Pakistan's proposal for a joint defense agreement with India is a tempting voice in the logic of the Cold War. The fact that Indo-Pakistani reconciliation is being used as bait does not change the fact that the basis for seeking reconciliation is not mutual friendship, but a common hostility towards a third party, which is a characteristic of Cold War disputes."

### 印度许多报纸纷纷发表评论  拒绝同巴基斯坦进行“共同防御”  重申继续为保持同中国的友好而努力

　　印度许多报纸纷纷发表评论
    拒绝同巴基斯坦进行“共同防御”
    重申继续为保持同中国的友好而努力
    本报讯　新德里消息：印度许多报刊连日来纷纷抨击关于印度同巴基斯坦进行“共同防御”的建议，并表示印度要继续奉行不结盟政策和同中国友好的政策。
    据报道，巴基斯坦总统阿尤布汗不久前曾经对新闻记者说，在印度遭到“外来的威胁”时，巴基斯坦和印度应该合作来共同“保卫”这片地区。在这以前，他还表示欢迎印度参加“共同防御”。巴基斯坦外交部长卡迪尔4月23日在卡拉奇更公开表示，西藏事件“令人觉得有可能”把印度拉入东南亚条约组织和使它“靠近”巴基斯坦。而一些巴基斯坦报纸也乘机鼓吹印、巴共同“抵御外国进攻”。
    与此同时，美国的宣传机器从中煽动、挑拨和破坏中印关系，并以促进印巴关系为名进行敌视中国的宣传。美国“基督教科学箴言报”说：西藏事件使“结束印度和巴基斯坦之间的长期的、代价高昂的争执有了某种希望。这些行动应该受到华盛顿和英联邦所能够给予的全部谨慎的支持。”
    印度总理尼赫鲁5月4日在联邦院就西藏局势所发表的讲话中回答了这个问题。他说，“不管发生什么样的事情，我们不打算与任何国家订立军事同盟，我要非常清楚地说明这一点。”他并说：“我完全赞成解决我们同巴基斯坦的纠纷，过一种正常的友好的睦邻的生活。我们为此而努力。”但是，“我们不希望有一种共同的防御政策，这种政策几乎是某种军事联盟的另一个说法。我们一向奉行的整个政策是反对这种观念的。”尼赫鲁4月27日在人民院还说印度不会使印中两国“产生了敌对情绪”。
    印度许多报纸发表社论和文章，支持尼赫鲁总理的立场，谴责了西方国家和巴基斯坦上述的别有用心的挑拨性的宣传。
    印度“闪电”周刊的文章说：“我们西方的恩人们正在利用西藏悲剧疯狂地把印度拖进冷战中去，他们使用的方法是残酷的和无耻的”。文章的作者说，在他访问阿拉伯东方期间，他见过一些美国和巴基斯坦人士，他们几乎异口同声说，他们预料印度和中国可能发生大冲突，如果西藏问题能够拖到年底的话。作者说：印度“由于历史的需要，必须执行一种积极的中立和同中国友好的政策，尽管西藏的事态发展使印度的立场受到很大的压力。”
    “印度时报”认为，“如果卡迪尔（巴基斯坦外长）认为印度同中国在西藏问题上的分歧已经使它（印度）的不卷入冷战的政策有所改变的话，那他就是犯了重大的错误。”这家报纸说，“而且，军事同盟要求在国际问题上的看法一致，这种一致的看法在印度和巴基斯坦之间是不存在的。”这家报纸说，关于要印度参加“共同防御”的主张“如果不是完全不正直的，也是空想的。”
    印地文报纸“印度斯坦日报”发表评论说：“巴基斯坦参加了军事集团，而印度希望完全站在这种集团之外。只要两国之间存在着这种基本的区别，要缔结两国的共同防御协定是不可能的。”
    这家报纸在谈到“印度和中国的关系在西藏问题上紧张起来”以后说，“尽管如此，印度不会使它的基本外交政策有任何改变。印度已经表示信守潘查希拉的原则，它不能把它们放弃”。
    印度“政治家报”的评论说：“巴基斯坦的论点认定印度是需要防御中国人的。这不是事实。印度继续认为，从根本上说，它同中国的关系是友好的”。它还说：尼赫鲁“将继续为保持同中国的友好而努力”，“对印度来说，并不存在什么放弃任何立场的问题”。
    “印度快报”的社论说：“不管在西藏危机上发生了什么分歧，认为印度和中国会决裂或者打起仗来，那是卡拉奇的主观愿望。军事同盟和冷战的辩护者设想印度会改变它的经过郑重考虑的不结盟政策，那也同样是愚蠢的。”它又说，“如果指望说服印度像巴基斯坦那样在它的外交政策方面犯同样的错误，那也是可笑的事。”这家报纸问道，“巴基斯坦究竟是否在认真地、真诚地希望保持这片次大陆的和平和完整？”它说，“要是巴基斯坦接受了印度一再提出的非战声明的话，共同防御的目标实际上本来就已经完全实现了。”它指出，这种声明本来会有助于解决两国之间的主要争端。这家报纸提醒说，“巴基斯坦的领袖们并不隐讳这个事实：他们的国家参加了巴格达条约，接受美国的军事援助以便对印度发动战争，并且用武力来夺取克什米尔。”
    “印度斯坦旗报”的社论说，谁也不应该认为，“中国在西藏的行为可能使这个国家（印度）离开严格中立的道路而同西方集团结成任何种类的联盟”。
    这家报纸的社论还说，“巴基斯坦关于同印度缔结共同防御协定的建议是冷战逻辑中具有诱惑力的声音。印度—巴基斯坦和好被用来作为诱饵这一点并不能改变这样一个事实：谋求和好的基础不是互相友好，而是对第三者的共同敌视，这是冷战纠纷的特征”。
