Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 25th. The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front held an expanded meeting today and issued a statement condemning the Lao Phoui Sananikone government, at the instigation of the United States, for blatantly violating the Geneva Agreements on Laos, abandoning their agreements with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, wantonly creating civil war, and increasingly seriously threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement listed various facts about the Sananikone government's aforementioned violations of the agreement and emphasized that these actions of the Sananikone government occurred simultaneously with Ngo Dinh Diem's large-scale mopping-up operations and fascist persecution in South Vietnam. This is clearly part of the US imperialists' conspiracy to create tensions in Indochina and prepare to launch a war of aggression.

The statement of the Fatherland Front fully supports the position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, demanding that the Lao government strictly fulfill the Geneva Agreements on Laos and the agreements signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, cease provocative acts in the Vietnamese-Lao border area, demand that the Lao International Commission immediately resume its activities, and request the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference to take timely measures to resolve the increasingly serious situation in Laos.

The statement concluded: "The Vietnamese people believe that the Lao people, who once fought arduously alongside the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units for peace, independence, and national harmony, will surely unite closely and actively struggle to stop the extremely dangerous actions carried out in Laos by the reactionary elements in the Sananikone government and US imperialism. If the Phoui Sananikone government refuses to abandon its policy of following US imperialism, creating tensions in Laos, and undermining peace in Laos, they must bear full responsibility for the consequences they create, and they will surely suffer a crushing defeat."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 24th. Soviet newspapers "Red Star" and "Naval Gazette" published articles today pointing out that the current situation in Laos is entirely caused by US imperialism, and the dangerous playing with fire by the Lao ruling clique will never produce good results. The articles unanimously stated that all circles in the Soviet Union fully agree with the statements of China, Vietnam, and other peace-loving countries demanding that the Lao ruling clique stop undermining the Geneva Agreements.

The "Red Star" article said that the reason for the current events in Laos is because Laos occupies an important position in the US plan to invade China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The existence of a strong democratic movement in Laos hinders the realization of US imperialist conspiracies. Therefore, under the instruction of US imperialism, the Sananikone government created the current dark events. Facts show that the United States wants to create tensions in Laos, more extensively control Laos, so as to prepare for opposition against Laos' peaceful neighbors.

The article emphasized that the Lao ruling clique should stop undermining the Geneva Agreements and begin cooperating with the Lao International Control and Supervision Commission.

The "Naval Gazette" article emphasized that the Lao government recently declared that it is no longer bound by the Geneva Agreements. This statement shows that Laos is grossly violating its obligations according to Washington's instructions. The article said that US interference in Lao internal affairs is intensifying, and the Sananikone government has handed over a huge air force base to the US military. With the permission of the Lao government, US military agencies are supplying food and ammunition through the northern provinces of Laos to Kuomintang bandits who are wandering in the border areas of Burma, Thailand, Laos, and the People's Republic of China. The United States and South Vietnam are carrying out espionage and provocative activities against China and Vietnam within Laos. The article said that the Lao government has embarked on a path of rejecting national unity, peace, and neutrality, which poses a great danger to Indochina and Southeast Asia, and this cannot but cause serious concern to those who care about peace and security interests.

    越南祖国战线中央发表声明
    老挝政府制造内战威胁东南亚和平
    苏联报纸指出老挝紧张局势是美国一手制造的阴谋
    新华社河内25日电  越南祖国战线中央委员会今天举行扩大会议，并发表声明谴责老挝培·萨纳尼空政府在美国嗾使下明目张胆地破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议，背弃他们同寮国战斗部队签订的协议，恣意制造内战，愈来愈严重地威胁越南民主共和国的安全和印度支那同东南亚地区的和平。
    声明列举了萨纳尼空政府上述违反协议的种种事实，并强调指出，萨纳尼空政府的这些行为同吴庭艳在南越进行大规模的扫荡和法西斯迫害同时发生，这显然是美帝国主义在印度支那制造紧张局势、准备发动侵略战争阴谋的一部分。
    祖国战线的声明完全支持越南民主共和国的立场，要求老挝政府严格履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，停止在越、老边境地带的挑衅行为，要求老挝国际委员会立即恢复活动，要求1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席及时采取措施解决日益严重的老挝局势。
    声明最后说：“越南人民相信，曾经同前寮国战斗部队一起为争取和平、独立，实现民族和睦而艰苦奋斗的老挝人民，必将紧密地团结起来为制止萨纳尼空政府中的反动分子和美帝国主义一起在老挝所进行的极其危险的行动而积极奋斗。如果培·萨纳尼空政府不肯放弃跟从美帝国主义、制造老挝紧张局势和破坏老挝和平的政策，他们就必须对自己制造出来的后果负完全责任，他们一定要遭到惨重的失败。”
    新华社莫斯科24日电  苏联“红星报”、“海军报”今天发表文章指出，目前老挝局势是美帝国主义一手造成的，老挝统治集团的危险玩火决不会得出好结果。文章一致表示，苏联各界完全同意中国、越南和其他爱好和平的国家要求老挝统治集团停止破坏日内瓦协议的声明。
    “红星报”的文章说，老挝以发生目前的事件是因为老挝在美国侵略中国和越南民主共和国的计划中占着重要地位。而老挝强大的民主运动的存在妨碍着美帝国主义阴谋的实现，因此，萨纳尼空政府在美帝国主义的指使下，制造了目前的黑暗事件。事实说明，目前，美国要在老挝造成紧张局势，更加广泛地控制老挝，以便为反对老挝的和平邻邦作好准备。
    文章强调指出，老挝统治集团应该停止破坏日内瓦协议的行为，并且开始和老挝的国际监察和监督委员会合作。
    “海军报”的文章强调指出，老挝政府不久前声明，它不再受日内瓦协议的约束。这一声明表明老挝按照华盛顿的指示，粗暴地破坏它所承担的义务。文章说，美国对老挝内政的干涉正在加强，萨纳尼空政府已把巨大的空军基地交给美军。在老挝政府允许下美军事机构正在通过老挝北部省份把食品弹药供应给在缅甸、泰国、老挝和中华人民共和国交界处流窜的国民党匪徒。美国和南越正在老挝境内进行反对中国和越南的特务挑衅行为。文章说，老挝政府已走上了拒绝民族团结、和平和中立的政策的道路，这对印度支那和东南亚孕育着很大的危险性，这不能不引起关心和平和安全利益的人们的严重耽心。
