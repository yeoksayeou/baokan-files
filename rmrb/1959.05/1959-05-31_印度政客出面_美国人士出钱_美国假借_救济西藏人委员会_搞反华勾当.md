Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The "Blitz" weekly reporter Raghavan from New Delhi reported that "the Central Relief (Tibetan) Committee, organized by People's Socialist Party leader Kripalani, has provided Americans with an effective organization to keep the Tibetan issue boiling on Indian territory."

Raghavan pointed to the fact that "an analysis of the aid received by the committee so far shows that almost all of it is donated in dollars and dollar commodities." The reporter also published a list of American organizations and individuals who have "donated" money and goods to this "committee." Among them are the "American Emergency Committee," the "American Cooperative for Overseas Remittances," the "World Church Service," and even General Gruenther, former head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization representing the American Red Cross.

Raghavan pointed out that American relief work "experts" have also come to India, "trying to make every dollar spent according to the strategic needs of the American Cold War against China."

The reporter wrote, "It is obvious that, regardless of Kripalani's intentions, the Central Relief (Tibetan) Committee has become a cover for Americans to continue inciting the Tibetan issue in India to damage Sino-Indian relations. For them, twelve thousand Tibetan refugees are merely guinea pigs in their laboratory for experimenting with new routes of anti-China hysteria."

    印度政客出面　美国人士出钱
    美国假借“救济西藏人委员会”搞反华勾当
    新华社29日讯　印度“闪电”周报记者拉加凡从新德里报道说，“由人民社会党头子克里帕拉尼组织的中央救济（西藏人）委员会，已为美国人提供一个有效的组织来使西藏问题在印度领土上继续沸腾不息。”
    拉加凡指出了这样一个事实：“对委员会到现在为止已经收到的援助所进行的分析表明，几乎全部援助都是用美元和美元商品捐赠的。”这位记者并且发表了向这个“委员会”“捐赠”财物的美国组织和美国人名单。其中有“美国紧急委员会”、“美国邮递援外合作社”、“世界教会服务会”，甚至还有代表美国红十字会的前北大西洋公约组织头子格仑瑟将军。
    拉加凡指出，美国救济工作“专家”也来到印度，“设法使每一块美元都根据美国对中国所进行的冷战的战略需要来花费”。
    记者写道，“显而易见，不管克里帕拉尼的打算如何，中央救济（西藏）委员会已成为掩护美国人在印度境内继续在西藏问题上进行煽动以损害印中关系的一种幌子。对他们来说，一万二千个西藏难民只不过是他们试验反华歇斯底里新路线的实验室里的豚鼠。”
