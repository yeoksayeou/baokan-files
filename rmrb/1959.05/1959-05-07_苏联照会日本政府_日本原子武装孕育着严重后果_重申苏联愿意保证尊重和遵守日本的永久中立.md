　　Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Moscow on the 5th (TASS): The Soviet government, in a note delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 4th, warned the Japanese government against taking measures that would lead to Japan's preparation for atomic warfare, measures which harbor grave consequences for the Japanese people.

　　The note, delivered by the Soviet Embassy in Japan, recounts that the Soviet government, in two notes issued in May and June of last year, had requested the Japanese government to clarify whether reports and statements in the Japanese press and by political figures regarding the import of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering such weapons – aircraft, rockets, etc. – into Japanese territory were true. To date, the Japanese government has not provided a definitive response.

　　The note points out that numerous facts now indicate, first, that the Japanese government is encouraging the equipping of American forces stationed in Japan with nuclear weapons; and second, that steps are being taken towards equipping the Japanese army with such weapons.

　　The note states that the deployment of nuclear and rocket weapons on Japanese territory, as well as the arming of the Japanese army with this type of weapon, cannot but affect the security interests of Japan's neighboring countries. Moreover, Japan's atomic armament would trigger a nuclear arms race in the Far East, which could be exploited by countries pursuing a "brinkmanship" policy to create dangerous crises. The Soviet government must, therefore, take all necessary measures to protect the security of the Soviet Far East. Japan's other neighbors cannot remain indifferent to this.

　　The note says that the Soviet government hopes that the Japanese government will fully consider the extremely grave consequences of Japan's atomic armament for Japan itself and its people. The Japanese people should clearly understand what involvement in the atomic and rocket arms race means for a small territory and densely populated nation like Japan.

　　The note states that the Soviet government has repeatedly stated that the security of Japan lies not in Japan's atomic armament, but in the elimination of foreign military bases on its territory and in Japan's adherence to a policy of neutrality. The Soviet government reiterates its willingness to guarantee respect for and compliance with Japan's permanent neutrality. To this end, discussions could be held with the Japanese government on the conclusion of corresponding treaties between the Soviet Union and Japan, or between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and Japan. Alternatively, discussions could be held on the conclusion of a multilateral treaty guaranteeing Japan's neutrality, with the participation of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the United States, and other relevant countries in the Asia-Pacific region. If Japan desires its neutrality to be guaranteed by the United Nations, the Soviet government would also welcome such a solution.

　　At the same time, the Soviet government believes that the establishment of a zone of peace in the Far East and the entire Pacific region, primarily a zone free of atomic and hydrogen weapons, would be in the interests of strengthening peace in the Far East, that is, in the interests of strengthening the security of Japan itself and the security of other countries in the Far East. The Soviet government is willing to make every effort to promote the establishment of such a zone of peace in the Far East and the entire Pacific region.

### 苏联照会日本政府  日本原子武装孕育着严重后果  重申苏联愿意保证尊重和遵守日本的永久中立

　　苏联照会日本政府
    日本原子武装孕育着严重后果
    重申苏联愿意保证尊重和遵守日本的永久中立
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联政府4日在一份交给日本外务省的照会中警告日本政府，不要采取对日本人民孕育着严重后果的、导致日本准备原子战争的措施。
    这份由苏联驻日本大使馆递交的照会追述说，苏联政府在去年5、6月间先后发出的两次照会中，曾经要求日本政府澄清：日本报纸和政界人士有关往日本境内运入核武器和运入这种武器的载运工具——飞机、火箭等的报道和谈话是否属实。但直到目前，日本政府尚未作出肯定的回答。
    照会指出，现在很多事实说明，第一，日本政府鼓励以核武器装备驻在日本境内的美国军队，其次，正在采取走向用这种武器装备日本军队的步骤。
    照会说，在日本领土上配置核武器和火箭武器以及用这种类型的武器武装日本军队，这些措施不能不影响到日本邻国安全的利益。而且，日本的原子武装还会在远东引起核军备竞赛，这可能被奉行“战争边缘”政策的国家用来制造危险的危机。对此，苏联政府不得不为着苏联远东地区安全的利益采取一切措施。日本的其他邻国也不能漠然视之。
    照会说，苏联政府希望，日本政府能充分考虑日本的原子武装对日本本国和它的人民的极其严重的后果。日本人民应该清楚地了解到，领土较小、人口稠密的日本，卷入原子军备和火箭军备竞赛意味着什么。
    照会说，苏联政府曾一再表示，保障日本的安全不在于日本的原子武装，而在于消除它的领土上的外国军事基地，在于日本奉行中立政策。苏联政府再一次重申，愿意保证尊重和遵守日本的永久中立。为此，可以同日本政府讨论：在苏联和日本之间，或者在苏联、中华人民共和国和日本之间缔结相应的条约；也可以讨论缔结关于有苏联、中华人民共和国、日本、美国和亚洲及太平洋区域其他有关国家参加的、集体保证日本中立的多边条约。如果日本希望它的中立得到联合国的保证，那么苏联政府也将欢迎这样来解决这个问题。
    同时，苏联政府认为，在远东和整个太平洋区域建立和平区，首先是建立无原子武器和氢武器区会符合加强远东和平的利益，也就是，符合加强日本本身的安全以及远东其他国家的安全的利益。苏联政府愿意竭力促成在远东和整个太平洋区域建立这种和平区。
