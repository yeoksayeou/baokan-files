Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish People
Jerzy Morawski, Head of the Polish United Workers' Party Delegation to China, Member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party

At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party has come to the People's Republic of China to exchange experiences with each other like brothers.

As comrades-in-arms in the common cause of socialism, we are here to learn about the experience of the Chinese people in socialist construction and the activities of the Communist Party that leads this construction.

The Chinese comrades have provided very favorable conditions so that during our short visit, we can visit as much as possible and understand their work in as much detail as possible.

We would like to once again express our warm gratitude for the warm, fraternal reception our delegation has received. We thank the leading comrades of the Chinese Communist Party in the capital and the provinces we visited for taking so much valuable time out of their busy schedules and giving us so much care, which has greatly facilitated our completion of our mission. We thank the Chinese comrades for creating a sincere and genuine Party atmosphere in all meetings and conversations.

In People's China, we traveled more than 5,000 kilometers, visited eight provinces, eleven large cities, many large and small factories and enterprises, a series of people's communes, as well as universities and cultural institutions.

Wherever we went, we immediately saw the grand scale of socialist construction in the economic and cultural life of the Chinese people. Everywhere we personally witnessed how the Chinese Communist Party's call to realize the great leap forward in the development of People's China in the shortest possible time is actively supported by the Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals in their daily work.

Obviously, the countless natural resources densely distributed across China's vast land are conducive to the realization of this great leap forward. However, before the working people became masters of the country, these huge resources had remained largely unutilized for centuries, and most were even unknown.

The Chinese people's unparalleled diligence and perseverance are also conducive to the great leap forward. However, when American and Western European imperialists used Chinese feudal and comprador bourgeois running dogs to exploit and oppress the Chinese people with the most brutal and despicable means, and shackled them with fetters, the diligent hands of Chinese workers and peasants could not enable the country to get rid of weakness and backwardness.

It was not until after the victory of the Chinese revolution led by the Communist Party that a fundamental turning point was completed in Chinese history.

As everyone knows, this victory was not easy to achieve. The land of China was stained with the blood of the Chinese people who fought for their own liberation.

Our delegation visited many places in Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hunan, and Jiangxi that evoke memories of the revolutionary struggle and the countless sacrifices made by the Chinese people. While paying tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle, we can say together with the Chinese comrades that they did not sacrifice in vain. The struggle of the Chinese people converged with the struggle of the revolutionary proletariat in other countries into a torrent, especially the victorious proletariat of Russia, who under the leadership of Lenin founded the first state of workers and peasants in history, opening up a new era in human history. This provided more favorable conditions for the further struggle and victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

We visited with deep emotion the site in Shanghai where the Communist Party of China was born thirty-eight years ago, and also the places in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, that are related to the establishment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1927.

Polish revolutionaries and all Polish working people have always held ardent sympathy and solidarity with the Chinese people's liberation struggle! When the Polish and Chinese revolutionary movements were led by Communists, and the common idea of Marxism-Leninism connected us together, this unity became more consolidated. Since the moment our two peoples embarked on the road of socialism, our unity has taken the form of fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance.

It has been only ten years since the liberation of China, but this is a very short period in the history of a nation. However, during this period, the Chinese people have completed the cause of an entire era. During our visit to the People's Republic of China, wherever we went, we could say that the lives of the Chinese people today and their future prospects are very different from those before liberation, as different as day and night. The unity of mass strength achieved by the correct political line of the Chinese Communist Party and the mobilization of all material and spiritual forces towards the great people in order to unleash China's economic potential has enabled China to achieve more and more fruitful results year after year.

China's industrialization experience is valuable and beneficial to us. Due to the maximization of production capacity and the ever-improving organization of labor, the production of long-existing industrial centers, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other factories in Liaoning Province, or factories in Shanghai, has increased several times since liberation. At the same time, new and huge industrial centers are being established, such as the huge Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise and industrial zone under construction, the entire industrial city of Zhuzhou, which is truly being built in the wilderness, the growing factory area of Nanchang, and the new large factory enterprises in the suburbs of Beijing and Shanghai. Here I only mentioned a few of the industrial centers we visited. This practice of concentrating efforts first on the basic industries that produce the means of production will rapidly establish the foundation for the industrialization of the entire national economy and provide the diligent hands of the Chinese people with modern technology. Due to the implementation of this policy, labor productivity has greatly increased today, and will increase many times more in the future.

Particularly valuable is the contribution made by the Chinese Communist Party's "walking on two legs" policy to the practice of socialist construction. Simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, simultaneous development of light and heavy industries, and simultaneous development of large, medium, and small industries have accelerated the industrialization of the entire national economy. The efforts of the Chinese comrades to develop industry using indigenous methods, often semi-handicraft methods, wherever possible, while developing modern industry at the present stage have also achieved the expected results. This method not only rapidly expands industrial production, but also more rapidly promotes the development of modern industry and improves the industrial technical level of millions of new workers.

We believe that the people's communes have played a great and positive role in China's socialist construction, especially in improving agricultural production and promoting the industrialization of rural areas, as well as in organizing collective forces to build water conservancy projects, roads, and other projects. This new form of socialist labor organization and collective life, which is based on the conditions of People's China, is a valuable harvest for the Chinese peasant masses, and it is promoting the accelerated development of the entire Chinese economy and culture along the socialist road.

The great leap forward in the industrial and agricultural development of People's China is creating the necessary conditions for gradually improving the living standards of the broad masses, as can be seen from the huge residential construction. The great leap forward also includes the extensive development of education, which is not limited to young people, but also includes adult working people who were denied access to education in the past society. The great leap forward will ultimately bring about tremendous social and educational achievements.

The Chinese people's booming enthusiasm, their confidence in their own strength, and their selfless labor for the benefit of society, as well as their conscious discipline arising from combining their personal life aspirations with the common cause of the entire people—all of these constitute the great achievements in socialist construction.

The collective efforts of the great people, organized, are changing the face of China. On the basis of a poor and economically backward country in the past, a powerful socialist country is growing at an extraordinary speed, and it will catch up with and surpass Britain and West Germany in terms of total industrial output in a not long time. What we have already seen in China makes us believe that the time limit set by the Chinese comrades for completing this task—ten years—will actually be shortened.

People's China is making its own increasingly significant contribution to the global competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism. The example of People's China once again shows how much creativity the people can unleash under socialism.

These achievements have been achieved due to the correct policies of the Communist Party of China, which, like before when it victoriously led the Chinese people in the struggle for national and social liberation, is now leading the construction of socialist China.

During the visit, we saw how much the Chinese people respect and love their party. They associate their most beautiful and sublime hopes with the activities of the Party. They selflessly carry out the instructions of the Party. The great prestige of the Communist Party of China among the people is due to its correct political line, its close ties with the masses, and the self-sacrificing spirit of its cadres in serving the people.

In discussions with activists of the Communist Party of China, both sides demonstrated a full agreement of views on all basic issues. What connects us together is not only the common goal—building socialism—but also the common doctrine of Marxism-Leninism that illuminates the road to this goal for us. In order to realize the general and universally valid Marxist-Leninist principles pointed out in the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the twelve socialist countries in one's own country, it not only does not exclude, but on the contrary, requires each party to formulate and adopt the forms and methods of socialist construction that are most suitable for the conditions of its own country and are therefore the most effective. The activities of the Communist Party of China are undoubtedly an example of steadfastly adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, while at the same time creatively developing and applying them in accordance with the conditions of its own country. Therefore, the Communist Party of China not only effectively solves the problems it faces, but also enriches the experience of the entire international workers' movement.

The basic principle of the policies of our two parties is to strengthen the unity of the entire socialist camp. Because the unity of the socialist camp guarantees and promotes the socialist construction of each of our countries. Therefore, we wage a resolute struggle against everything that undermines and weakens this unity, especially against the main danger in the current workers' movement—modern revisionism, which tries to disarm the working class in the face of class enemies. We also resolutely fight against dogmatism that separates the party from the masses and hinders the creative development of socialist construction.

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, People's Poland, and other countries of the socialist camp are the hope of all working people in the world. Our achievements, our struggles and labor, our unity, our mutual assistance in building socialism, are the most effective guarantee for stopping imperialist war adventures and strengthening peace and progress for all mankind.

Therefore, the achievements of the People's Republic of China make us happy just like our own achievements. Dear Chinese comrades, we are with you in the great cause of socialist construction, just as we are with you in your just struggle to liberate Taiwan and in your struggle against the rebellion of the reactionary clique in Tibet and the imperialist conspiracy. We believe that our delegation's visit to People's China will strengthen the friendship and cooperation between our two parties and our two countries.

A deep understanding of the rich experience of the Communist Party of China is of great significance and will be of great benefit to our Party. Our delegation will convey the important and valuable experience of the Chinese Communists that we have learned to our Party. Although our conditions are different in many ways, we are moving towards a common goal, and creatively utilizing the experience of fraternal parties is of great help to each of our parties.

Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people have also achieved great historical achievements in their own development. In the less than fifteen years since the establishment of the people's government, the face of our country has changed. Now, we are implementing the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, which points out the direction of Poland's development in the next seven years.

Further realizing the socialist industrialization of the country, gradually carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, and raising the socialist consciousness of the masses—these are the main instructions in the resolutions. The fraternal support given to our country by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries is an important lever for us to move forward.

Whether it is the Party Committee or the workers, peasants, intellectuals and youth, we were deeply moved by the fraternal reception to our delegation. Throughout the long journey, we were warmly welcomed everywhere by the Chinese people, who expressed sympathy and support for the distant People's Poland, which is moving towards the same socialist goal. We would like to express our deep gratitude for the hospitality and friendship given to us by the Chinese people.

We believe that the future visit of a delegation of the Communist Party of China to Poland will play a major role in further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between our two parties and two countries. We are waiting for this delegation, and we will welcome it not only as dear guests of our Party and our people, but also as brothers with common ideals—comrades in our common cause and struggle.

Long live Sino-Polish friendship!

May the fraternal unity and cooperation of the Soviet Union, People's China, People's Poland, and all countries of the socialist camp continue to strengthen!

Long live the great Chinese people and their vanguard—the Communist Party of China! And wish them new victories!

    波中两国人民的友谊万岁
    波兰统一工人党访华代表团团长波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、书记处书记  耶日·莫拉夫斯基
    波兰统一工人党代表团应中国共产党中央委员会的邀请，到中华人民共和国来像兄弟一样互相交流经验。
    作为共同的社会主义事业的战友，我们到这里来的目的是要了解中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的经验，以及领导这一建设的共产党的活动。
    中国同志们提供了非常有利的条件，使我们在不太长的访问期间，能够尽可能多地参观和尽可能详细地了解他们的工作。
    我们愿意在这里再一次地为我们代表团所受到的亲切的、兄弟般的接待表示热烈的感谢。感谢在首都和我们所访问的各省的中国共产党的领导同志们在百忙之中为我们抽出很多宝贵的时间和给予我们这样多的关怀，使我们在完成任务方面得到很大的方便。感谢中国同志们在各次会见和交谈中所创造的真诚的、真正的党的气氛。
  在人民中国我们走了五千多公里的路程，到过八个省份，参观了十一个大城市，和许多大大小小的工厂企业，一系列的人民公社，以及高等学校和文化机构。
    无论我们到哪里，我们都立刻看到中国人民在经济和文化生活方面的社会主义建设的宏伟规模。我们到处都亲眼看到中国共产党提出来的在最短期间内实现发展人民中国的大跃进的号召，在中国的工人、农民和知识分子的每日的工作中如何得到积极的拥护。
    显然，密布在中国辽阔土地上的无数自然财富有利于这个大跃进的实现。然而，在劳动人民没有成为国家的主人之前，这些巨大的财富千百年来几乎一直都没有被利用过，甚至大部分都为人所不知。
    中国人民无比的勤劳和坚忍不拔的精神也有利于大跃进。然而，当美国和西欧帝国主义者利用中国封建和买办资产阶级走狗，使用最残暴和最卑鄙的手段剥削和压迫中国人民，用枷锁束缚着他们的时候，中国工人和农民的勤劳的双手就不能使国家摆脱软弱和落后状态。
    直到共产党领导的中国革命获得胜利以后，在中国的历史上才完成了一个根本的转折。
    大家知道，这个胜利的获得是不容易的。中国的土地上洒满了为自己的解放而斗争的中国人民的鲜血。
    我们的代表团访问了北京、武汉、广州、上海、湖南、江西的许多使人回忆起革命斗争和中国人民所作出的无数牺牲的地方。在向那些在革命斗争中牺牲的烈士们致敬的同时，我们能够同中国同志们一起说，他们并没有白白地牺牲。中国人民的斗争同其他国家的革命无产阶级所进行的斗争汇集成一股巨流，其中特别是俄国的胜利的无产阶级，他们在列宁的领导下创立了历史上第一个工人和农民的国家，在人类的历史上开辟了一个新的时代。这就为在中国共产党领导下的中国人民的进一步斗争和胜利提供了更加有利的条件。
    我们怀着深切感动的心情参观了三十八年前中国共产党在上海诞生的故址，也参观了江西省省会南昌的那些同1927年中国解放军建立有关的地方。
    波兰的革命者和波兰全体劳动人民一直对中国人民的解放斗争抱着热烈的同情和团结一致的感情！当波兰和中国的革命运动由共产党人领导，而马克思列宁主义的共同思想把我们连接在一起的时候，这个团结就更为巩固了。自从我们两国人民走上了社会主义道路的时刻起，我们的团结就采取了兄弟般的合作和互助的形式。
    中国解放虽已十年，但这在民族的历史上是一个非常短的时期。然而，在这个时期里中国人民却完成了整整一个时代的事业。当我们在中华人民共和国访问期间，无论到什么地方，我们都可以说，中国人民今天的生活以及他们未来的远景同解放以前的情况大不相同，这就像白天和黑夜一样。由于中国共产党的正确的政治路线所取得的群众力量的团结一致和为了发挥中国经济潜力而向伟大人民进行的一切物质和精神力量的总动员，使中国获得一年比一年更加丰硕的成果。
    中国工业化的经验对于我们是宝贵的和有益的。由于最大限度地利用生产能力和日益完善的劳动组织，使得早就存在的工业中心，如鞍山钢铁公司和辽宁省的其他工厂或上海的工厂，自从解放以来生产提高了好几倍。同时，新的巨大的工业中心正在建立起来，如正在建设中的巨大的武汉钢铁联合企业和工业区，真正是在旷野上建立起来的整个工业城市株洲，成长着的南昌的工厂区以及北京和上海郊区的新的大工厂企业。这里我提到的仅仅是我们参观的工业中心之中的几个。这种把精力首先集中于生产生产资料的基础工业上的作法，将迅速地建立起整个国民经济工业化的基础，并为中国人民勤劳的双手提供现代化的技术。由于这个方针的实施，劳动生产率今天已经大大地提高了，而在将来还要提高许多倍。
    特别宝贵的是，中国共产党实行的“两条腿走路”的政策为社会主义建设的实践所作的贡献。工农业并举、轻重工业并举、大中小工业并举加速了整个国民经济的工业化。中国同志们在现阶段发展现代化工业的同时，在凡是可能的地方都利用土法，常常是半手工业的方法来发展工业的努力也得到了预期的成果。这种方法不仅迅速地扩大了工业生产，而且更加迅速地促进现代化工业的发展和提高成百万新工人的工业技术水平。
    我们认为，人民公社在中国的社会主义建设中，特别是在提高农业生产和促进农村的工业化中，以及在组织集体力量兴修水利、修筑道路等工作中，起了伟大的积极的作用。这种根据人民中国的条件而产生的社会主义劳动组织和集体生活的新形式是中国农民群众的宝贵的收获，它正在促进整个中国的经济和文化沿着社会主义道路加速发展。
    人民中国工业和农业发展的大跃进，为逐步提高广大群众的生活水平创造着必要的条件，这可以从巨大的住宅建筑上看出来。大跃进也包括教育事业的广泛发展，这不仅限于青年，而且也包括成年的劳动人民，在过去的社会里，他们受教育的道路是被封闭了的。大跃进最终将带来社会和教育方面的巨大成果。
    中国人民蓬勃的热情、他们对自己力量的信心和为社会利益而进行的忘我劳动，以及他们由于把个人的生活愿望和全民的共同事业结合起来而产生的自觉的纪律性——所有这些就构成了社会主义建设中的伟大成就。
    伟大人民组织起来的集体的努力在改变着中国的面貌。在过去贫困的、经济上落后的国家的基础上，一个强大的社会主义的大国以异常迅速的速度在成长着，它将在一个不长的时间内在工业总产量方面赶上和超过英国和西德。我们在中国已经看到的东西使我们相信，中国同志提出来的完成这个任务的期限——十年——实际上还将缩短。
    对社会主义和资本主义两个体系的世界性的竞赛，人民中国正在作出自己日益增长的重大的贡献。人民中国的范例再一次表明，社会主义能够发挥多么大的人民的创造力。
    这些成就之所以取得，是由于中国共产党的正确的政策，中国共产党像以前胜利地领导中国人民争取民族解放和社会解放的斗争一样，现在正领导着社会主义中国的建设。
    在访问期间，我们看到中国人民是多么尊敬和热爱自己的党。他们把自己最美好的和最崇高的希望同党的活动联系在一起。他们忘我地执行着党的指示。中国共产党在人民中的巨大威望是由于它的正确的政治路线、它与群众的密切联系和它的干部为人民服务的自我牺牲精神。
    在和中国共产党活动家座谈时，我们双方在一切基本问题上都表明了观点的充分一致。把我们连接在一起的不仅是共同的目标——建设社会主义，而且还有给我们照亮了达到这个目标的道路的共同的马克思列宁主义的学说。为了在自己的国家中实现在十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党宣言中所指出的总的、普遍有效的马克思列宁主义原则，不但不排斥，而相反地却要求每个党都制订和采用最适合本国条件的、因之也最有效的社会主义建设的形式和方法。中国共产党的活动无疑是坚定地忠于马克思列宁主义原则、而同时又依照自己国家的情况创造性地加以发展和运用的典范。因此，中国共产党不仅有效地解决着面临的问题，同时也丰富着整个国际工人运动的经验。
    我们两党的政策的基本原则是加强整个社会主义阵营的团结。因为社会主义阵营的团结保证和促进着我们每个国家的社会主义建设。所以，我们向一切破坏和削弱这个团结的东西进行坚决的斗争，特别是向目前工人运动中的主要危险——现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争，现代修正主义尽力在阶级敌人面前解除工人阶级的武装。我们也坚决地同使党脱离群众和阻碍创造性地发展社会主义建设的教条主义进行斗争。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、人民波兰和社会主义阵营的其他国家是世界全体劳动人民的希望。我们的成就、我们的斗争和劳动、我们的团结，我们在建设社会主义中的互助，是制止帝国主义战争冒险、加强全人类和平和进步的最有效的保障。
    因此，中华人民共和国的成就就像我们自己的成就一样使我们高兴。亲爱的中国同志们，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中我们和你们在一起，正像在你们解放台湾的正义斗争中以及在你们反对西藏反动集团的叛乱和帝国主义阴谋的斗争中我们和你们在一起一样。我们相信，我们代表团在人民中国的访问将加强我们两党和我们两国的友谊和合作。
    深入了解中国共产党的丰富经验具有巨大意义，这对我们党有很大好处。我们代表团将把我们所了解到的中国共产党人的重要的珍贵的经验转告我们的党。尽管我们所处的条件在许多方面是不同的，但是，我们是向共同的目标前进，创造性地利用兄弟党的经验对我们每个党都有巨大的帮助。
    波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下在自己的发展中也取得了伟大的历史性的成就。在人民政权建立以来的不满十五年中，我们国家的面貌改变了。现在，我们正在执行着波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的决议，决议指出了今后七年波兰发展的方向。
    进一步实现国家社会主义工业化，逐步进行农业社会主义改造，提高群众的社会主义觉悟——这是决议中的主要指示。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家给予我们国家的兄弟般的支持是我们向前迈进的重要杠杆。
    无论是党的委员会，还是工人、农民、知识分子和青年，对我们代表团的兄弟般的接待，都使我们深为感动。在整个漫长的旅途中，我们到处受到了中国人民热诚的欢迎，他们对遥远的、但却向着同一个社会主义目标前进的人民波兰表示同情和支持。对中国人民给予我们的这种款待和友情，我们愿意表示我们深切的谢意。
    我们相信，中国共产党代表团将来在波兰的访问，将对进一步加强我们两党和两国的友谊和合作起重大的作用。我们等待着这个代表团，我们不但把它当作我们党和我们人民亲爱的贵宾来欢迎，而且把它当作我们有着共同理想的兄弟——我们共同事业和斗争的同志来欢迎。
    波中友谊万岁！
    让苏联、人民中国、人民波兰和所有社会主义阵营国家的兄弟团结和合作不断加强！
    伟大的中国人民及其先锋队——中国共产党万岁！并祝走向新的胜利！
