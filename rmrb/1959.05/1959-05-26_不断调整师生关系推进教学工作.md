    Continuously Adjusting Teacher-Student Relationships to Promote Teaching Work
    Tian Fu, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, China University of Science and Technology

    Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the "three-way combination" method of the Party Committee, teachers, and students is the specific application and development of the Party's mass line in education work, and it is an important guarantee for improving teaching quality. In the "three-way combination," the leadership of the Party Committee mainly involves timely understanding, analyzing, and resolving the contradictions in teaching, adjusting teacher-student relationships, and continuously pushing teaching work forward.

    Teaching and learning are two aspects of the same process of imparting and receiving knowledge, and they are the common activities of teachers and students. Teachers are the transmitters of knowledge and play a leading role in teaching work. Teachers teach to enable students to learn. Teaching well is a prerequisite for learning well. Students are the recipients of knowledge, and their responsibility lies in how to master, consolidate, and apply the knowledge imparted by teachers. Generally speaking, students occupy a subordinate position in teaching. However, if teachers teach the course with clear concepts and clear organization, making it easy for students to accept, but the students' learning attitude is not very correct and their learning methods are not right, so they do not learn well, then the learning aspect takes the main position. This dialectical unity of teaching and learning runs through the entire teaching process of teachers imparting knowledge and students learning it well, and it is expressed through the relationship between teachers and students. Therefore, the teaching problem is essentially a matter of teacher-student relations under the leadership of the Party Committee. Therefore, in order to lead the teaching work well, the school Party Committee must strengthen ideological leadership over teachers and students, and frequently understand, analyze, and adjust teacher-student relationships.

    In the teaching process, the relationship between teachers and students is generally that students require teachers to impart systematic knowledge, and teachers require students to respect their leading position in teaching and to "digest," consolidate, and integrate the knowledge they impart into their own knowledge. If teachers and students cooperate and promote each other, then the quality of teaching will continue to improve.

    At our China University of Science and Technology, there were certain contradictions in the relationship between teachers and students when new students first entered the school. The main problems were: teachers and students were not clear enough about the purpose of teaching; some teachers did not have a good grasp of the content and teaching methods of the subjects they were teaching, and they did not consider the students' level; students were not accustomed to university study and life when they first entered the university from middle school, and some students did not have a correct learning attitude or learning methods, which affected the teaching effect, and the mood of both teachers and students was not comfortable enough. After the school Party Committee organized everyone to earnestly study the Party's education policy, teachers and students became clear about the purpose of teaching. Most teachers realized the importance of cultivating "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture," and they had to improve teaching content and methods according to the training objectives. Many teachers realized that the key to teachers implementing the "three-way combination" policy lies in: first, obeying the leadership of the Party; second, integrating with the students, improving teacher-student relations, and being highly responsible for the students, both teaching and educating. The students also changed their thinking of seeking fame and becoming experts but not being red, clarified their learning goals, and corrected their learning attitudes. Some students said: "The Party's education policy is a beacon, illuminating our path forward."

    However, the contradiction between teaching style and teaching methods became prominent again. We started with the teachers' side first. Each department generally adopted the form of teacher-student forums. Through the forums, teachers directly and specifically learned about the students' academic foundation, learning situation, and requirements for lectures. Many teachers were very touched when they saw the students' confused and anxious mood and their urgent desire to learn their lessons well; some teachers said on the spot: "We will do everything in our power to ensure good teaching." This communicated the opinions between teachers and students. Mutual trust was increased, and teachers and students strengthened unity on a new basis. In addition, young teachers were encouraged to go deep into the students and strengthen their guidance. Many young teachers can integrate with the students and are both teachers and students, as well as comrades and friends. They are close to each other, talk about everything, and truly achieve ideological exchange. In answering questions and tutoring, they paid attention to listening to students' opinions and adopted different methods for different learning levels, tutoring with different content of varying depths. While helping teachers improve their teaching style and teaching methods, the Party organization also helped students further correct their learning attitudes and improve their learning methods. Through this series of work, on the basis of mutual promotion and common improvement between teachers and students, the school has seen a new situation of teacher-student cooperation, democratic unity, and mutual teaching and learning, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved. In the final exam last semester, more than 70% of the students achieved excellent results.

    In the new situation where democratic and equal teacher-student relationships were initially established, new contradictions arose. This is how to implement respect for teachers and love for students under the leadership of the Party and mutual teaching and learning, and to give full play to the leading role of teachers in teaching. The Party organization seized this new problem and focused its work on the students. After leaders organized students to study, they raised their awareness and unified their thinking. The students realized that in teaching work, it is necessary to give play to the leading role of teachers. First, they must learn humbly from teachers, so that they can liberate their minds, think independently, and learn deeply and thoroughly on this basis. Then, a respect for teachers campaign was launched. Students took the initiative to contact teachers, strengthen social interaction, conduct individual interviews, write letters, write big-character posters, write poems to praise and thank teachers. The students' actions to respect teachers touched the teachers and strengthened their sense of responsibility for teaching and their love for the students. Teachers and students can be honest with each other in their interactions, actively engage in self-criticism, and study together to improve teaching methods. This further deepened the unity and cooperation between teachers and students and ensured the correct exercise of the leading role of teachers in teaching.

    Of course, giving play to the leading role of teachers in teaching means strengthening the teachers' sense of political and ideological responsibility for the students. Teachers should explain the Party's education policy and the socialist scientific work path to students through business practices, and teach students to take the road of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert; they should constantly strengthen the ideology of teaching content and cultivate students' dialectical materialism worldview and methodology. Therefore, this responsibility is great, and this requirement is very high. Teachers must strive to study Marxism-Leninism theory and earnestly carry out self-ideological transformation, so that they can influence students with their words and deeds and truly teach students well.

    The school Party organization has continuously promoted teaching work by continuously resolving the contradictions between teaching and learning and continuously adjusting the relationship between teachers and students. This is how we have done it in the past, and we will strengthen this aspect of our work in the future.

    不断调整师生关系推进教学工作
    中国科学技术大学党委副书记  田夫
    在党委领导下，党委、教师、学生三结合的方法，是党的群众路线在教育工作中的具体运用和发展，是提高教学质量的重要保证。在“三结合”中，党委的领导，主要是：及时了解、分析和解决教学之间的矛盾，调整师生关系，把教学工作不断推向前进。
    教与学是传授知识和接受知识的同一过程的两个方面，是教师和学生的共同活动。教师是知识的传授者，在教学工作中是起主导作用的。教师教，是为了使学生学。教好是学好的前提。学生是知识的接受者，其责任就在于如何掌握、巩固和运用教师所传授的知识。一般地说，学生在教学中处于从属地位。但是，如果教师把课程教得概念明确、条理清楚，使学生容易接受，而学生的学习态度却不很端正，学习方法也不对头，从而没有学好，这时学的方面就居于主要地位了。教与学，这种对立统一的关系，是贯穿在教师传授知识和学生学好知识的同一教学过程之中的，是通过教师与学生的关系表现出来的，所以说，教学问题实质上是党委领导下的师生关系问题。因此，学校党委为了把教学工作领导好，就必须加强对教师和学生的思想领导，经常了解、分析和调整师生关系。
    在教学过程中，教师和学生之间的关系，一般是学生要求教师教给系统的知识，教师要求学生尊重其在教学上的主导地位，把他所传授的知识，“消化”、巩固、融会贯通变成自己的知识。如果师生相互协作，相互促进，那末，教学质量就会不断提高。
    在我们中国科学技术大学的师生之间的关系，在新生刚开始入学时是有着一定的矛盾的。主要是：师生对教学目的都不够明确；有些教师没有很好掌握自己所担任的学科内容和教学方法，教学不看对象；学生由于刚从中学进入大学，开始不习惯大学的学习生活，有的学生学习态度不够端正，学习方法也不对头，从而影响了教学效果，师生之间心情都不够舒畅。经过学校党委组织大家认真地学习了党的教育方针，师生对教学的目的性明确了。大部分教师认识到培养“有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者”这一责任的重大，必须根据培养目标，改进教学内容和方法。不少教师体会到教师贯彻实行“三结合”的方针，关键在于：一、服从党的领导；二、要和学生打成一片，搞好师生关系，达到对学生高度负责，既教书又教人。学生们也改变了成名成家和“只专不红”的思想，明确了学习目的，端正了学习态度。有些学生说：“党的教育方针是指路明灯，照亮了我们前进的道路。”
    但是，教学作风和教学方法的矛盾又突出了。我们就先从教师方面着手。各系普遍采用了师生座谈会的形式，通过座谈，使教师直接地、具体地了解到学生的学业基础、学习情况以及对讲课的要求。不少教师亲眼看到学生们那种困惑焦急的心情和迫切学好功课的要求，都非常感动；有的教师当场表示：“要尽一切力量，保证教好。”这就沟通了师生之间的意见。彼此提高了信任，使师生在新的基础上加强了团结。另外，鼓励青年教师深入到学生中去，加强对学生的辅导。许多青年教师都能和学生打成一片，既是师生，又是同志和朋友。彼此亲密无间，无话不谈，真正做到了思想见面。在答疑、辅导中，注意了倾听学生意见，针对不同的学习程度，采用不同的方式，辅导以深浅不同的内容。在帮助教师改进教学作风和教学方法的同时，党组织又帮助学生进一步端正学习态度，并且改进学习方法。通过这一系列的工作，在师生相互促进、共同提高的基础上，学校出现了师生合作，民主团结，教学相长的新局面，教学质量有了显著提高。在上学期期终考试中，70％以上的学生获得了优良成绩。
    在民主平等的师生关系初步树立的新情况下，又出现了新的矛盾。这就是怎样才能贯彻在党的领导和教学相长下、尊师爱生，充分发挥教师在教学上的主导作用。党组织抓住这一新的问题，着重在学生中进行了工作。经过领导与组织学生学习以后，提高了认识，统一了思想。学生们认识到在教学工作中必须发挥教师的主导作用，首先要向教师虚心学习，才能在这基础上解放思想，独立思考，学深学透。接着，就开展了尊师活动。学生们主动和老师联系，加强生活上的往来，进行个别访问，写信、写大字报、写诗表扬和感谢老师。学生们的尊师行动，感动了教师，增强了教师对教学的责任感、对学生的喜爱。师生在彼此往来中，能够推诚相见，主动进行自我批评，相互研究改进教学方法了。这样，进一步加深了师生之间的团结合作，保证了正确发挥教师在教学上的主导作用。
  当然，发挥教师在教学中的主导作用，就是要加强教师对学生的政治思想的责任感。教师应当通过业务实践向学生阐明党的教育方针和社会主义的科学工作道路，教导学生走又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的道路；应当不断加强教学内容的思想性，培养学生的辩证唯物主义的世界观和方法论。因此，这样的责任是重大的，这样的要求是很高的，教师必须努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，认真地进行自我思想改造，才能够以自己的言行影响学生，真正把学生教好。
    学校党组织在不断地解决教与学的矛盾中，不断地调整师与生之间的关系，从而不断地推进了教学工作。过去这样作了，今后还要加强这一方面的工作。
