Grand Gathering in the Capital Commemorates the 40th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement
Guo Moruo, Kang Sheng, Hu Yaobang, and others spoke, calling for the promotion of revolutionary traditions and moving from victory to greater victory.
More than 30,000 people shouted: Oppose interference in China's internal affairs, safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the motherland.
Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: People and youth from all walks of life in the capital held a grand gathering at the Xiannongtan Stadium this afternoon to solemnly commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. More than 30,000 people made heroic remarks at the meeting: Carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, and forever follow the broad road of building socialism pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, marching with heroic and bold steps from victory to greater victory.

Today's meeting was also a demonstration against imperialism and foreign reactionaries interfering in our internal affairs. People expressed immense indignation at the acts of imperialism and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs. More than 30,000 people shouted: "Oppose the Tibetan rebellion instigated by imperialism and foreign reactionaries, oppose interference in China's internal affairs!" "Tibet is an inseparable part of China, crush the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity!"

Beijing, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, enjoyed clear weather this afternoon. Forty years ago, our country was in a period of internal and external troubles, people living in misery, a fragmented land, and a scene of darkness. At that time, our country's revolutionary youth took the lead, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and opened the prelude to the new democratic revolution. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after forty years of long, arduous, and tortuous revolutionary path, we finally got rid of the fate of being bullied and slaughtered, and established an independent, democratic, and free New China. Now, our country is leaping forward with the momentum of a thousand miles a day. Today, the old warriors who ignited the revolutionary fire of the "May Fourth" Movement and the youth of all ethnic groups and all walks of life who grew up in the new society gathered in the Xiannongtan Stadium from all directions. They waved colorful flowers, sang the song "Socialism is Good," warmly hailed the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, and hailed the brilliant achievements of the motherland's socialist construction.

Lin Boqu and Peng Zhen, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Liu Lantao, alternate secretary of the Secretariat, Wu Yuzhang, Cai Chang, Lin Feng, Yang Xiufeng, and Zhang Jichun, members of the Central Committee, and Zhou Yang and Zhao Yimin, alternate members of the Central Committee, attended the meeting. When they stepped onto the rostrum, people waved bouquets and applauded warmly for a long time, thanking the Party for its kind concern for the younger generation. Seated on the rostrum were also responsible persons of democratic parties and non-party democrats Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, and Xu Deheng, responsible persons of the Beijing Party and government Liu Ren, Deng Tuo, and Wu Han, President of Peking University Ma Yinchu, President of Tsinghua University Jiang Nanxiang, as well as famous labor models and combat heroes in Beijing.

Komocsin Zolt√°n, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League, who is currently visiting our country, and the Hungarian Communist Youth League delegation led by him, the African student delegation, and the Japanese youth and women delegation were invited to attend the meeting.

At 1:30 p.m., the meeting began amidst warm applause. The band played the national anthem.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the 40th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, delivered the opening speech (full text on page 3). He said that the history since the "May Fourth" Movement is the history of the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the history of the Chinese people's resolute struggle against imperialism and the reactionary ruling class, and the history of the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. Forty years of experience tell us that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the Chinese people complete the new democratic revolution and promptly advance the revolution to a new stage of socialism.

He went on to say that with the arrival of the upsurge of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction has begun to appear in our country. This is a cultural revolution that is broader and more profound than the "May Fourth" era. He warmly hoped that intellectuals across the country would work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, continuously strengthen ideological transformation, and integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants to cultivate themselves into worker-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

Guo Moruo said that the youth of our country have always been the most active, most dynamic, and most energetic force in our society. In the "May Fourth" Movement of that year, the youth took the lead. He enthusiastically hopes that the youth who grew up in the great Mao Zedong era will emit the light and heat of youth to the maximum extent in the construction cause of the motherland.

Guo Moruo's speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Amidst the warm cheers of the audience, Comrade Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke (full text on page 3). He said: In these forty years, our motherland has experienced a tremendous change. At the time when the May Fourth Movement occurred, the Chinese people lived under the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism and feudalism. This dark era is gone forever. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country has not only completely completed the democratic revolution, but also achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our socialist motherland is like the rising sun appearing on the eastern horizon.

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that commemorating the May Fourth Movement requires launching a broad movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory, resolutely implementing the policy of intellectual laborization and worker-peasant mass intellectualization, and carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement.

Comrade Kang Sheng said: Now, the people of the whole country are making arduous efforts to strive for a better tomorrow. We must go all out, rely on the masses, overcome various difficulties, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 industrial and agricultural production plan.

Comrade Kang Sheng finally said: "Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, and advance bravely!"

During Comrade Kang Sheng's speech, colorful flowers were waving, applause thundered, and loud slogans rose and fell in the vast venue.

This commemorative meeting was jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, the China Association for Science and Technology, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation. Liu Ningyi, Xu Guangping, Shen Yanbing, Li Siguang, and Hu Yaobang also spoke at the meeting. Their speeches were all warmly welcomed.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that the task before us now to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science. Undoubtedly, this is a very great task, but also a very arduous task. Since our predecessors could bravely shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country and the nation, the people of our country, especially the youth of our country, will certainly more bravely shoulder the great task of building the motherland. Liu Ningyi said that this year we must continue to leap forward on the basis of the victory in 1958. As long as we exert greater revolutionary energy, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary predecessors since the "May Fourth" Movement who were not afraid of hardship and difficulties, and the courage to undertake difficult tasks, actively participate in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on the technical revolution, fully develop the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and work hard, skillfully, and practically, we will certainly be able to achieve this year's continued leap forward.

Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said in her speech: "To commemorate the glorious festival of 'May Fourth', we must carry forward the patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of 'May Fourth', and build our great motherland even better with our creative labor."

She said: "Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao, the youth of all ethnic groups in our country have made great contributions in the past revolutionary movement and socialist construction. In the future construction, you will have to shoulder greater and more arduous responsibilities. I hope you will further carry forward the 'May Fourth' spirit, use the best labor achievements, and a great harvest in thought and learning to answer the expectations of the Party and the country, and use practical actions to complete and over fulfill the grand plan of the national economy in 1959, and to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China."

Shen Yanbing, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said that China's new culture was produced in the surging tide of the "May Fourth" Patriotic Movement, leaving a rich legacy. Today's cultural revolution has a more profound significance and a larger scale. When commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth", we look forward to the prospects of the cultural revolution and review the roads we have experienced in the past. We must, under the leadership of the Party, carry forward the glorious tradition of the "May Fourth", go all out, strive for the upstream, and resolutely complete the great task of the cultural revolution. He said that building a socialist culture is a great subject given to us by history. We must go deep into the masses, participate in physical labor, work hard to transform our thinking, and strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. We must master modern scientific achievements and excellent culture and art, continue to invent and create, and strive for the great cause of socialist and communist society!

Li Siguang, Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, said at the meeting that forty years ago, many talented patriotic intellectuals in China, especially many outstanding scientific and technical talents, deeply felt that their heroes had no place to use. Now, the construction of the motherland has put forward a large number of requirements for scientific and technological workers, and our strength is far from meeting the tasks required of us by the motherland. The Party and the people require that our country be built into a country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long time. This is not a task that can be completed by a few people, but requires the entire Party and the entire people to work together and launch a mass movement of technical revolution to cultivate a huge scientific and technological team. Our scientific and technical workers must not fail this era, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "May Fourth", under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, march towards science and technology with soaring energy, and contribute wisdom and strength to the historical task of building a new socialist China.

Finally, Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke (full text on page 3). He called on the vast number of young people across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, to push the great cause pioneered by the revolutionary predecessors and revolutionary martyrs to new and greater victories. He said that our Party hopes that the youth of our country will come up with the greatest revolutionary energy and become a commando force to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward. This means having a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, regarding every task entrusted to them by the organization as their glorious duty, and using every means to complete it on time, in quantity, and in quality. This means being most actively involved in the production increase and economy practice movement, regarding contributing one more effort, shedding one more drop of sweat, saving one more point of material, and creating one more point of wealth as a noble obligation to serve the overall interests. This means having the indomitable will to not be afraid of difficulties and to dare to overcome difficulties. Wherever the Party points, we will rush there. Wherever there is a need, we will rush there. This means striving to master technology, striving to learn advanced experience, and actively participating in technical innovation and technical revolution on the basis of hard study to do our work more and better. More than 10 million students in universities and middle schools in our country must also go all out in this year's Great Leap Forward and strive for a triple harvest in reading, labor, and thought. To achieve all this requires the youth of our country to have higher thoughts and higher qualities, that is, the most noble and greatest communist thoughts and communist qualities.

The comrades who spoke at this grand meeting unanimously condemned the acts of imperialism and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs. Comrade Kang Sheng solemnly declared in his speech: We will completely eliminate the rebellion of pro-imperialist elements in Tibet. Crush the conspiracy of imperialists and foreign interventionists to interfere in our internal affairs, support the rebels, and undermine our country's unity! Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people resolutely defend their territorial sovereignty and will never allow imperialism and foreign reactionary forces to interfere in any form or reason. He pointed out: "We hope that influential politicians in India can maintain rationality, clearly recognize the world trend, and recognize the serious damage to Sino-Indian relations caused by Indian expansionists' interference in our internal affairs and support for Tibetan bandits, and stop all kinds of unwise and unfriendly words and deeds against our country." Others pointed out in their speeches that Tibet will always be the Tibet of the Chinese people, and Tibet will always be the Tibet of China. The Chinese people have the power to prevent the fraternal people of our country from being bullied by foreign aggressors. The Chinese people have the power to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of their great motherland. The conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists will never succeed.

These words received a warm response from the audience. More than 30,000 fists stretched over the top of their heads, and more than 30,000 throats issued a thunderous roar against interference in China's internal affairs and to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the motherland.

After the speeches, more than 30,000 people stood up and shouted slogans for a long time, and countless colorful balloons slowly rose into the air from people's hands. At this time, people waved colorful bouquets and sang "Socialism is Good" in unison. Then, 2,000 university students in the capital performed a chorus, the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed a helicopter flight show, and the Hebei and Nanjing troops performed a football match. The Xiannongtan Stadium was completely immersed in the joy of youth. (Photo attached)
