Forty years ago, our country was in a dark period of internal and external troubles, people living in misery, and a fragmented land.
Today, our socialist motherland is like the rising sun appearing on the eastern horizon.
Grand Gathering in the Capital Commemorates the 40th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement
Guo Moruo, Kang Sheng, Hu Yaobang, and others spoke, calling for the promotion of revolutionary traditions and moving from victory to greater victory.
More than 30,000 people shouted: Oppose interference in China's internal affairs, safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the motherland.
Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: People and youth from all walks of life in the capital held a grand gathering at the Xiannongtan Stadium this afternoon to solemnly commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. More than 30,000 people made heroic remarks at the meeting: Carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, and forever follow the broad road of building socialism pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, marching with heroic and bold steps from victory to greater victory.

Today's meeting was also a demonstration against imperialism and foreign reactionaries interfering in our internal affairs. People expressed immense indignation at the acts of imperialism and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs. More than 30,000 people shouted: "Oppose the Tibetan rebellion instigated by imperialism and foreign reactionaries, oppose interference in China's internal affairs!" "Tibet is an inseparable part of China, crush the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity!"

Beijing, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, enjoyed clear weather this afternoon. Forty years ago, our country was in a period of internal and external troubles, people living in misery, a fragmented land, and a scene of darkness. At that time, our country's revolutionary youth took the lead, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and opened the prelude to the new democratic revolution. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after forty years of long, arduous, and tortuous revolutionary path, we finally got rid of the fate of being bullied and slaughtered, and established an independent, democratic, and free New China. Now, our country is leaping forward with the momentum of a thousand miles a day. Today, the old warriors who ignited the revolutionary fire of the "May Fourth" Movement and the youth of all ethnic groups and all walks of life who grew up in the new society gathered in the Xiannongtan Stadium from all directions. They waved colorful flowers, sang the song "Socialism is Good," warmly hailed the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, and hailed the brilliant achievements of the motherland's socialist construction.

Lin Boqu and Peng Zhen, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Liu Lantao, alternate secretary of the Secretariat, Wu Yuzhang, Cai Chang, Lin Feng, Yang Xiufeng, and Zhang Jichun, members of the Central Committee, and Zhou Yang and Zhao Yimin, alternate members of the Central Committee, attended the meeting. When they stepped onto the rostrum, people waved bouquets and applauded warmly for a long time, thanking the Party for its kind concern for the younger generation. Seated on the rostrum were also responsible persons of democratic parties and non-party democrats Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, and Xu Deheng, responsible persons of the Beijing Party and government Liu Ren, Deng Tuo, and Wu Han, President of Peking University Ma Yinchu, President of Tsinghua University Jiang Nanxiang, as well as famous labor models and combat heroes in Beijing.

Komocsin Zoltán, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League, who is currently visiting our country, and the Hungarian Communist Youth League delegation led by him, the African student delegation, and the Japanese youth and women delegation were invited to attend the meeting.

At 1:30 p.m., the meeting began amidst warm applause. The band played the national anthem.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the 40th Anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, delivered the opening speech (full text on page 3). He said that the history since the "May Fourth" Movement is the history of the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the history of the Chinese people's resolute struggle against imperialism and the reactionary ruling class, and the history of the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. Forty years of experience tell us that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the Chinese people complete the new democratic revolution and promptly advance the revolution to a new stage of socialism.

He went on to say that with the arrival of the upsurge of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction has begun to appear in our country. This is a cultural revolution that is broader and more profound than the "May Fourth" era. He warmly hoped that intellectuals across the country would work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, continuously strengthen ideological transformation, and integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants to cultivate themselves into worker-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

Guo Moruo said that the youth of our country have always been the most active, most dynamic, and most energetic force in our society. In the "May Fourth" Movement of that year, the youth took the lead. He enthusiastically hopes that the youth who grew up in the great Mao Zedong era will emit the light and heat of youth to the maximum extent in the construction cause of the motherland.

Guo Moruo's speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

Amidst the warm cheers of the audience, Comrade Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke (full text on page 3). He said: In these forty years, our motherland has experienced a tremendous change. At the time when the May Fourth Movement occurred, the Chinese people lived under the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism and feudalism. This dark era is gone forever. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country has not only completely completed the democratic revolution, but also achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our socialist motherland is like the rising sun appearing on the eastern horizon.

Comrade Kang Sheng pointed out that commemorating the May Fourth Movement requires launching a broad movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory, resolutely implementing the policy of intellectual laborization and worker-peasant mass intellectualization, and carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement.

Comrade Kang Sheng said: Now, the people of the whole country are making arduous efforts to strive for a better tomorrow. We must go all out, rely on the masses, overcome various difficulties, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1959 industrial and agricultural production plan.

Comrade Kang Sheng finally said: "Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, and advance bravely!"

During Comrade Kang Sheng's speech, colorful flowers were waving, applause thundered, and loud slogans rose and fell in the vast venue.

This commemorative meeting was jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, the China Association for Science and Technology, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation. Liu Ningyi, Xu Guangping, Shen Yanbing, Li Siguang, and Hu Yaobang also spoke at the meeting. Their speeches were all warmly welcomed.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that the task before us now to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science. Undoubtedly, this is a very great task, but also a very arduous task. Since our predecessors could bravely shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country and the nation, the people of our country, especially the youth of our country, will certainly more bravely shoulder the great task of building the motherland. Liu Ningyi said that this year we must continue to leap forward on the basis of the victory in 1958. As long as we exert greater revolutionary energy, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary predecessors since the "May Fourth" Movement who were not afraid of hardship and difficulties, and the courage to undertake difficult tasks, actively participate in the production increase and economy practice movement centered on the technical revolution, fully develop the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and work hard, skillfully, and practically, we will certainly be able to achieve this year's continued leap forward.

Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said in her speech: "To commemorate the glorious festival of 'May Fourth', we must carry forward the patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of 'May Fourth', and build our great motherland even better with our creative labor."

She said: "Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao, the youth of all ethnic groups in our country have made great contributions in the past revolutionary movement and socialist construction. In the future construction, you will have to shoulder greater and more arduous responsibilities. I hope you will further carry forward the 'May Fourth' spirit, use the best labor achievements, and a great harvest in thought and learning to answer the expectations of the Party and the country, and use practical actions to complete and over fulfill the grand plan of the national economy in 1959, and to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China."

Shen Yanbing, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said that China's new culture was produced in the surging tide of the "May Fourth" Patriotic Movement, leaving a rich legacy. Today's cultural revolution has a more profound significance and a larger scale. When commemorating the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth", we look forward to the prospects of the cultural revolution and review the roads we have experienced in the past. We must, under the leadership of the Party, carry forward the glorious tradition of the "May Fourth", go all out, strive for the upstream, and resolutely complete the great task of the cultural revolution. He said that building a socialist culture is a great subject given to us by history. We must go deep into the masses, participate in physical labor, work hard to transform our thinking, and strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. We must master modern scientific achievements and excellent culture and art, continue to invent and create, and strive for the great cause of socialist and communist society!

Li Siguang, Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, said at the meeting that forty years ago, many talented patriotic intellectuals in China, especially many outstanding scientific and technical talents, deeply felt that their heroes had no place to use. Now, the construction of the motherland has put forward a large number of requirements for scientific and technological workers, and our strength is far from meeting the tasks required of us by the motherland. The Party and the people require that our country be built into a country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long time. This is not a task that can be completed by a few people, but requires the entire Party and the entire people to work together and launch a mass movement of technical revolution to cultivate a huge scientific and technological team. Our scientific and technical workers must not fail this era, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "May Fourth", under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, march towards science and technology with soaring energy, and contribute wisdom and strength to the historical task of building a new socialist China.

Finally, Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke (full text on page 3). He called on the vast number of young people across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, to push the great cause pioneered by the revolutionary predecessors and revolutionary martyrs to new and greater victories. He said that our Party hopes that the youth of our country will come up with the greatest revolutionary energy and become a commando force to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward. This means having a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, regarding every task entrusted to them by the organization as their glorious duty, and using every means to complete it on time, in quantity, and in quality. This means being most actively involved in the production increase and economy practice movement, regarding contributing one more effort, shedding one more drop of sweat, saving one more point of material, and creating one more point of wealth as a noble obligation to serve the overall interests. This means having the indomitable will to not be afraid of difficulties and to dare to overcome difficulties. Wherever the Party points, we will rush there. Wherever there is a need, we will rush there. This means striving to master technology, striving to learn advanced experience, and actively participating in technical innovation and technical revolution on the basis of hard study to do our work more and better. More than 10 million students in universities and middle schools in our country must also go all out in this year's Great Leap Forward and strive for a triple harvest in reading, labor, and thought. To achieve all this requires the youth of our country to have higher thoughts and higher qualities, that is, the most noble and greatest communist thoughts and communist qualities.

The comrades who spoke at this grand meeting unanimously condemned the acts of imperialism and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs. Comrade Kang Sheng solemnly declared in his speech: We will completely eliminate the rebellion of pro-imperialist elements in Tibet. Crush the conspiracy of imperialists and foreign interventionists to interfere in our internal affairs, support the rebels, and undermine our country's unity! Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people resolutely defend their territorial sovereignty and will never allow imperialism and foreign reactionary forces to interfere in any form or reason. He pointed out: "We hope that influential politicians in India can maintain rationality, clearly recognize the world trend, and recognize the serious damage to Sino-Indian relations caused by Indian expansionists' interference in our internal affairs and support for Tibetan bandits, and stop all kinds of unwise and unfriendly words and deeds against our country." Others pointed out in their speeches that Tibet will always be the Tibet of the Chinese people, and Tibet will always be the Tibet of China. The Chinese people have the power to prevent the fraternal people of our country from being bullied by foreign aggressors. The Chinese people have the power to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of their great motherland. The conspiracy of imperialists and Indian expansionists will never succeed.

These words received a warm response from the audience. More than 30,000 fists stretched over the top of their heads, and more than 30,000 throats issued a thunderous roar against interference in China's internal affairs and to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the motherland.

After the speeches, more than 30,000 people stood up and shouted slogans for a long time, and countless colorful balloons slowly rose into the air from people's hands. At this time, people waved colorful bouquets and sang "Socialism is Good" in unison. Then, 2,000 university students in the capital performed a chorus, the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed a helicopter flight show, and the Hebei and Nanjing troops performed a football match. The Xiannongtan Stadium was completely immersed in the joy of youth. (Photo attached)

    今天的大会也是一个反对帝国主义和外国反动派干涉我国内政的示威大会。人们对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱、干涉我国内政的行为，表示无比愤慨，三万多人振臂高呼：“反对帝国主义和外国反动派策动的西藏叛乱，反对干涉中国内政！”“西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，粉碎外国干涉者破坏中国统一的阴谋！”
    “五四”运动发源地的北京，今天下午天气晴朗。四十年前，我们的国家是处在内忧外患，民不聊生，山河破碎，一片黑暗的时期。当时，我国的革命青年，一马当先，高举着反帝反封建的旗帜，揭开了新民主主义革命的序幕。全国人民在中国共产党的领导下，经过了四十年漫长、艰苦、曲折的革命道路，我们终于摆脱了任人欺凌、任人宰割的命运，建立了一个独立、民主、自由的新中国。现在，我们的国家正以一日千里之势，飞跃向前。今天，当年燃起“五四”革命烈火的老战士同在新社会成长起来的各族各界青年一起，从四面八方涌进了先农坛体育场。他们挥舞着五颜六色的花朵，唱着“社会主义好”的歌曲，热烈欢呼马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利，欢呼祖国社会主义建设的辉煌成就。

    正在我国访问的匈牙利共青团中央第一书记科莫钦·佐尔坦和由他率领的匈牙利共青团代表团，非洲学生代表团，日本青年妇女代表团应邀出席了大会。
    下午一时三十分，大会在热烈的掌声中开始。乐队高奏国歌。
    纪念“五四”四十周年筹备委员会主任郭沫若致开幕词（全文见第三版）。他说，“五四”以来的历史，就是工人阶级及其先锋队领导的历史，就是中国人民坚决同帝国主义和反动统治阶级进行斗争的历史，就是马克思列宁主义在中国取得胜利的历史。四十年的经验告诉我们：只有在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民才能够完成新民主主义革命，并且及时地把革命继续推进到社会主义的新阶段上来。
    他接着说，随着经济建设高潮的到来，目前我国已经开始出现了文化建设的高潮。这是一个比“五四”时代更加广泛更加深刻的文化革命。他热烈地希望全国知识分子，都努力学习马克思列宁主义，不断地加强思想改造，和广大工农打成一片，把自己培养成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    郭沫若说，我国青年始终是我国社会中的最积极、最活跃、最有生气的力量。在当年的“五四”运动中，青年起了带头作用。他热情地希望生长在伟大的毛泽东时代的青年，在祖国的建设事业中，要最大限度地发出青春的光和热。
    郭沫若的讲话受到全场热烈的欢迎。
    在全场热烈的欢呼声中，中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志讲话
  （全文见第三版）。他说：在这四十年里，我们祖国经历了一个天翻地复的大变化。在五四运动发生的当时，中国人民生活在帝国主义和封建主义残酷的剥削和压迫之下。这个黑暗的时代已经一去不复返了。我国在中国共产党的领导下，现在不仅已经彻底地完成了民主主义革命，并且取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。我们的社会主义祖国，正像初升的太阳出现在东方的地平线上。
    康生同志指出，纪念五四运动，必须展开一个广泛的学习马克思列宁主义理论的运动，必须坚决贯彻执行知识分子劳动化和工农群众知识化的方针；必须发扬“五四”运动彻底革命的精神。
    康生同志说：现在，全国人民正在为着争取更美好的明天，作着艰巨的努力。我们要鼓足干劲，依靠群众，克服各种困难，为完成和超额完成1959年工农业生产计划而奋斗。
    康生同志最后说：“让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，发扬不断革命的精神，高举着马克思列宁主义的红旗，奋勇前进！”
    在康生同志讲话的过程中，广阔的会场上，彩花挥舞，掌声雷动，响亮的口号声此起彼伏。
    这个纪念大会是由中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华人民共和国科学技术协会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会联合举办的。在这个大会上讲话的还有，刘宁一、许广平、沈雁冰、李四光和胡耀邦。他们的讲话都受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    全国总工会主席刘宁一在讲话中说，现在，摆在我们面前的任务，是要把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。毫无疑问，这是一个非常伟大的任务，同时也是一个非常艰巨的任务。我们的先辈既然能勇敢地担当起救国家、救民族的重任，我国人民，特别是我国的青年，也必定会更勇敢地担当起建设祖国的伟大任务。刘宁一说，今年我们要在1958年胜利的基础上继续大跃进。只要我们鼓足更大的革命干劲，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，继承和发扬“五四”以来革命先辈的不避艰险，不怕困难的顽强斗志，和勇于担负艰难任务的勇气，积极投入以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，充分发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，进行苦干、巧干、实干，就一定能实现今年的继续大跃进。
    全国妇联副主席许广平在讲话中说：“纪念‘五四’这个光辉的节日，一定要发扬‘五四’的爱国热情和革命精神，以自己创造性的劳动，把我们伟大的祖国建设得更加美好。”
    她说：“我国各族青年在伟大的中国共产党和英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，在过去的革命运动和社会主义建设事业中，已经作出了巨大的贡献，在今后的建设事业中，你们将要负起更伟大更艰巨的责任。希望你们把‘五四’精神更加发扬光大，用最好的劳动成绩，用思想和学习上的大丰收来回答党和国家对你们的期望，用实际行动来完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济的宏伟计划，来迎接我们伟大的中华人民共和国建国十周年。”
    中国文学艺术界联合会副主席沈雁冰说，在“五四”爱国运动汹涌的浪潮中产生了中国的新文化，留下了丰富的遗产。今天的文化革命，其意义更为深刻，其规模更为广大。在纪念“五四”四十周年的时候，我们瞻望文化革命的远景，回顾过去经历的道路，我们一定要在党的领导下，发扬“五四”的光荣传统，鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚决完成文化革命的伟大任务。他说，建设社会主义的文化，这是历史交给我们的伟大课题，我们一定要深入群众，参加体力劳动，努力改造思想，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作。一定要掌握现代科学成就和优秀文化艺术，继续发明创造，为了社会主义和共产主义社会的伟大事业而努力奋斗！
    中国科学技术协会主席李四光在会上讲话，他说，四十年前中国许多有才能的爱国知识分子，特别是许多优秀的科学技术人才，深感英雄无用武之地。而现在是，祖国的建设向科学技术工作者提出了大量的要求，而我们的力量却远远不能满足祖国所要求于我们的任务。党和人民要求在不太长的时间内把我国建设成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的国家，这不是少数几个人所能完成的任务，而是要全党全民一齐动手，大搞技术革命的群众运动，培养出一个巨大的科学技术队伍。我们科学技术工作者不要辜负这个时代，要发扬“五四”的革命精神，在中国共产党的领导下，以冲天干劲向科学技术进军，在建设社会主义的新中国这一历史任务中，贡献智慧和力量。
    最后，由共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦讲话（全文见第三版），他号召全国广大青年，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，把革命前辈和革命先烈所开辟的伟大事业，推向新的更大的胜利。他说，我们的党希望我国青年拿出最大的革命干劲来，成为实现今年大跃进的一支突击力量。这就是要有高度的革命责任感，把组织上交给自己的每一项任务，看作是自己的光荣职责，用尽一切办法，按时、按量、按质地去完成它。这就是要最积极地投入到增产节约运动中去，把多出一分力，多流一滴汗，多省一分材料，多创造一分财富，看作是为整体利益服务的崇高义务。这就是要有不怕困难，勇于战胜困难的顽强意志，党指向那里，我们就冲向那里，那里需要，我们就向那里突击。这就是要努力掌握技术，努力学习先进经验，在刻苦钻研的基础上，积极参加技术革新和技术革命，把自己的工作做得更多更好。我国一千多万大中学校的同学，在今年的大跃进中，同样要鼓足干劲，力争读书、劳动、思想三丰收。要做到这一切，就要求我国青年有更高的思想和更高的品质，这就是人类最高尚的、最伟大的共产主义思想和共产主义品质。
    在这个盛大集会上讲话的同志，一致严正的谴责了帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱，干涉我国内政的行为。康生同志在讲话中庄严地宣告：我们要彻底消灭西藏亲帝国主义分子的叛乱。粉碎帝国主义者和外国干涉者干涉我国内政、支持叛乱分子、破坏我国统一的阴谋！郭沫若说，中国人民坚决保卫自己的领土主权，决不容许帝国主义和外国反动势力以任何形式、任何理由，进行干涉。他指出：“我们希望印度的有影响的政治家们，能够保持理智，清醒地认清世界潮流，认清印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政、支持西藏叛匪给中印关系带来的严重损害，停止对我国的各种不明智不友好的言行。”其他人在讲话中指出，西藏永远是中国人民的西藏，西藏永远是中国的西藏。中国人民有力量使我国亲如兄弟的各族人民不受外国侵略者的欺侮。中国人民有力量维护自己伟大祖国的统一和领土完整。帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子的阴谋是永远也不会得逞的。
    这些话得到了全场的热烈响应。三万多只拳头伸过头顶，三万多个喉咙发出了震天动地的反对干涉中国内政、维护祖国统一和领土完整的怒吼。
    讲话结束后，三万多人全体起立，长时间地高呼口号，数不清的彩色气球从人们的手中冉冉升上高空。这时，人们挥动五彩缤纷的花束，齐声高唱“社会主义好”。接着，首都两千名大学生表演大合唱，中国人民解放军空军部队作直升飞机飞行表演，河北与南京部队足球队作表演比赛。先农坛体育场完全沉浸在青春的欢乐中。（附图片）
