Seeking Friendship with a "Kite"
　　Bīng Xīn

　　Little friends, tomorrow is your own holiday - International Children's Day on June 1st. In the celebratory programs prepared for you, you will see a very interesting and beautiful color film co-performed by Chinese and French children, which is a great contribution to international unity and friendship. It's called "The Kite".

　　I don't know if you children have the same thoughts as me: every time during the "May Day" and National Day celebrations, when I see the parades, especially the colorful hydrogen balloons released by the children, some with slogans like "Long Live Chairman Mao" attached, slowly rising in groups in the breeze, and then gradually becoming smaller and smaller, my thoughts also fly with them to the distant horizon. I think: how far will these beautiful balloons fly? Where will they land? Will they get caught in a tree, or land on a mountain top, in a field, or on the sea? Who will find them? How happy will they be when they find them...

　　When I was little, I didn't release balloons, but I did fly kites. Sometimes when the wind was strong, my hand couldn't hold on or the string broke, and the kite would drift away with the wind, first as small as a bean, then as small as a grain of rice, and finally so small that it disappeared. Of course, I felt a little regretful, but I also thought that if this kite fell into the hands of another child, then he would definitely be very happy, and my happiness could be transmitted to someone else's heart, so I wouldn't regret it.

　　"The Kite," this movie story, begins like this. But this kite was intentionally released, it was a kite seeking friendship.

　　A young friend in Beijing, a Young Pioneer named Sòng Xiǎoqīng, flew a kite with an image of Sun Wukong, "all-powerful and with boundless magic," drawn on it. Attached to the kite was a letter seeking friendship, written in verse:

　　I entrusted this letter to the kite,
　　I entrusted this kite to the wind...
　　Today, this Chinese wind caresses me,
　　Tomorrow it may go looking for another child...

　　This kite was just like Sun Wukong riding on a somersault cloud. It flew over the skies of India, over the skies of Greece, over the skies of Central Europe, and finally swayed and fell over the skies of Paris, the capital of France, and got caught in a tall tree.

　　Piérot, a child in Paris, got this kite, and he eagerly wanted to go to China to find his friend Sòng Xiǎoqīng. He missed him so much that he had an extremely interesting dream at night: the all-powerful, clever, and lovable Sun Wukong jumped down from the kite! He agreed to Piérot's request, and with one breath, he blew Piérot and his little sister, bed and all, across the sea of clouds, and landed them in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing. And finally found his Chinese friend - Sòng Xiǎoqīng!

　　Dreams always have to end, but this beautiful and happy dream made Piérot even more eager to meet his Chinese friend. He and many French children wrote a reply to Sòng Xiǎoqīng. He also wrote a poem himself, tied it to the Sun Wukong kite, and sent it up to the sky. The poem said:

　　Children all over the world,
　　If you find this bird,
　　Then you can imagine,
　　You already have a new partner...

　　This kite is still flying in the sky today, flying over cities, flying over villages, flying over mountains, flying over oceans... a flock of snow-white doves are escorting it, and the crisp sound of bells is spreading the message of peace throughout the world...

　　Children, your lives today are already happy. Your future lives will be even better than today, because the future world belongs to you. Not only does everything we are building today belong to you, but you will also build even greater and more beautiful things for your own children.

　　To have peaceful construction, we must have a peaceful environment, and we must eliminate the threat of war. Opposing war and safeguarding peace is a very pleasant and arduous task. There are still imperialists in the world, so our work to safeguard peace must be strengthened every day. Many people in China and around the world are already doing this work. You are our successors, and you must consolidate and develop this work. You must join hands with French children, Soviet children, Indian children, Latin American children... to continue to strive for the construction of a happy and beautiful future world.

　　Children, to increase the ranks of safeguarding peace, we must seek new partners as early as possible. You must, like the child Lǐ Wén in the movie, often study world maps and recognize the flags of various countries. You should also read more fairy tales and stories, history and geography of various countries, as well as travelogues written by Chinese and foreign writers... Through these, we can understand something about the environments in which children of various countries live, their hopes and ideals, customs and habits... This kind of research is not only fresh and interesting, but also lays a good foundation for mutual understanding and friendship between international people. Don't you see that Piérot appeared in his dream with the Hall of Supreme Harmony, Beihai, Jingshan, the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the laughing and lively Chinese children in these beautiful and magnificent buildings on the first night he read Chinese picture books?

　　Okay, get ready to enjoy yourselves tomorrow, and I wish you a happy holiday! (Attached image)

### 寻求友谊的“风筝”

    寻求友谊的“风筝”
    冰心
    小朋友，明天是你们自己的节日——六一国际儿童节，在为你们准备的庆祝的节目中，你们会看到一部中国和法国的小朋友们合演的很有趣，很美丽，对于国际的团结友谊很有贡献的彩色影片，它的名字叫做“风筝”。
  我不知道小朋友有没有和我相同的想法：每逢“五一”节和国庆节，我看到游行队伍中，特别是小朋友们放起的五颜六色的氢气球，有的上面系着“毛主席万岁”的标语，在微风中成群结队地徐徐上升，以后渐远渐小，我的心思也和它们一起飞到遥远的天边。我想：这些美丽的气球不知道会飞到多远？在哪里落下？是挂在树上，还是落在山顶上，田野上，海水上？是什么人捡到？他捡到的时候，心里会多么快乐……
    我小的时候，没有放过气球，却放过风筝，有时风紧了，手拉不住或是挣断了线，这风筝就随风而逝，先像豆子那么小，后来像米粒那么小，最后小到看不见了。我心里当然有些惋惜，但是我也想到假如这风筝落到另一个小孩子的手里，那么他一定很快乐，我的快乐能传到了别人的心里，我就可以不惋惜了。
    “风筝”，这个电影故事，就是这样开头的。不过这风筝是有意放起的，是一只寻求友谊的风筝。
    北京的一位小朋友，少先队员宋小青，他放起一只上面画有“神通广大，法力无边”的孙悟空形象的风筝，风筝上附着一封寻求友谊的信，这信是用诗写的：
    我把这封信交给了风筝，
    我把这只风筝交给了风……
    今天，这股中国的风吹拂着我，
    明天它也许会去找另一个儿
        童。……
    这只风筝真像孙悟空驾起斤斗云一样，它飞过印度的上空，希腊的上空，中欧的上空，最后摇摇摆摆地在法国首都巴黎的上空落下，挂在一棵高树上了。
    巴黎的孩子比埃罗拿到了这只风筝，他就热望到中国去找他的朋友宋小青，他想念之极，夜里就做了一个极其有趣的梦：神通广大灵巧可爱的孙悟空，从风筝上跳下来了！他答应了比埃罗的请求，把比埃罗和他的小妹妹连床带人一口气吹过云海，送到中国北京的太和殿前面落下了。而且终于找到了他的中国朋友——宋小青！
    是梦总要醒的，但这美丽快乐的梦使比埃罗加倍地想见见他的中国朋友了。他和许多法国小朋友一起给宋小青写了一封回信。另外自己也做了一首诗，系在这只孙悟空风筝上，送上天去。这首诗里说：
    全世界的儿童，
    如果你们捡到这只鸟，
    那么你们就可以想到，
    你已经有了新的伙伴，……
    这只风筝到如今还在天上飞着，飞过城市，飞过乡村，飞过高山，飞过海洋……一群雪白的鸽子在护送着它，清脆的铃声，在全世界的上空，传播着和平的消息……
    小朋友，你们今天的生活，已经是幸福的了。你们将来的生活，比今天还要美好，因为将来的世界是你们的，不但今天我们所建设的一切都是你们的，你们还要为你们的小孩子，建造出比现在更伟大更美丽的东西。
    要有和平的建设，就得有和平的环境，就必须免除战争的威胁。反对战争，保卫和平是一件很愉快又很艰苦的工作。世界上还有帝国主义的存在，我们的保卫和平的工作就必须天天加强。现在中国和世界各国已经有许多人在做着这工作。你们是我们的接班人，你们必须把这工作巩固发展下去。你们必须和法国的小朋友，苏联的小朋友，印度的小朋友，拉丁美洲的小朋友……共同地携起手来，为建设幸福美好的将来的世界而继续奋斗。
    小朋友，要增加保卫和平的队伍，就得及早寻求新的伙伴。你们要像电影里的李文小朋友一样，常常研究世界地图，认识各国的国旗。你们也要多看各国的童话和故事，历史和地理，以及中外作家们所写的旅行游记……通过这些，我们可以了解一些各国小朋友们所处的环境，他们的希望和理想，风俗和习惯……这种研究，不但新鲜有趣，而且为国际人民间的相互了解和友谊，打下了良好的基础。你看比埃罗不是头天晚上看了中国的画报，在他的梦里就出现了北京的太和殿、北海、景山、天坛以及在这些美丽辉煌的建筑物里，欢笑活跃的中国小朋友们么？
    好了，准备明天尽情地欣赏吧，祝你们节日快乐！（附图片）
