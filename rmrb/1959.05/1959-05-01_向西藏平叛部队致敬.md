Saluting the Tibetan Pacification Troops
Wei Wei

Our People's Liberation Army is truly vigorous: in less than three days, they quelled the rebellion in Lhasa; in less than a month, they wiped out the bandit nests in Shannan in one fell swoop. Now, the rebel groups south of the Yarlung Zangbo River have been completely crushed, and the entire northern border of the Himalayas is under the control of our army. How decisive, efficient, and satisfying! Amid the jubilation of the whole country, we cannot help but extend our deepest gratitude to our heroic, capable, and consistently loyal People's Liberation Army, who are devoted to the interests of all ethnic groups in our country. Comrades, comrades galloping through the deep mountains and ridges, you have worked hard! Your actions have brought the dawn of true happiness to the Tibetan people. Let us all cheer loudly together.

Who knew that this matter would sadden and enrage a small group of people living on the other side of the Himalayas? With tears streaming down their faces, they uttered a chaotic clamor that almost deafened our ears. How strange! People cannot help but ask: What is the relationship between these esteemed gentlemen and the small handful of rebellious elements in Tibet? Why does the failure of the Tibetan rebellion make them so "sympathetic" and "uneasy"? The matter is very clear: they were planning to hold a celebration, but in the end, they wasted their efforts and had a pathetic pipe dream.

When good dreams fail to materialize, they resort to curses. They want to use curses to weaken the prestige of the great People's Republic of China among the people of the East. But their calculations are wrong again. China's strength and leap forward progress, China's enthusiastic support for oppressed nations, and China's faithful friendship with the great Indian people and the people of all Eastern countries, have been proven by long-standing and vivid facts. These facts cannot be erased from the kind hearts of the Eastern people by a few curses, a few articles in newspapers, a few slogans shouted in front of our embassy, or the distribution of one or two absurd statements. Frankly speaking, today, if anyone wants to take advantage of a few rebellious elements in Tibet to profit from it and realize their expansionist ambitions, they will regret it one day. Sooner or later, they will find that it is not the prestige of the People's Republic of China that has been weakened, but only that they themselves have become more isolated among the people.

Tibet was, is, and always will be an inseparable part of our great motherland. The conspiracies of British imperialism and Indian expansionists are useless, and open interference and curses are also useless. This can only make the Chinese people more profoundly aware of some people and some things, thereby stimulating their more ardent patriotic feelings, promoting the unity of our various nationalities, and promoting the unity and consolidation of our great motherland. For foreign interventionists, there is only one result: that is, in front of the people, they reveal their painted faces with white powder on their noses, making them awkward and embarrassed, and their prestige is swept away. But who can they blame for this? They can only blame themselves for being dizzy with heat and doing such a stupid thing.

Now, the Tibetan pacification troops are pursuing and annihilating the remaining bandits, and the Tibetan people are celebrating their new life. The history of Tibet has since revealed a bright and promising picture. On the great festival of the working people of the world – "May Day," let us once again pay tribute to the heroic and hardworking comrades of the People's Liberation Army.

    向西藏平叛部队致敬
    魏巍
    我们的解放军真带劲：不到三天时间，就平定了拉萨的叛乱；不到一个月，又一举荡平了山南叛匪的巢穴。现在雅鲁藏布江以南的叛乱集团全被粉碎，喜马拉雅山北部全部国境线，已在我军的控制之下。真是干脆、麻利、痛快！在举国欢腾声中，由不得要向我们英勇的、能干的、一贯忠实于我国各族人民利益的解放军，寄上深深的谢意。同志们，在深山峻岭间奔驰的同志们，你们辛苦了！你们的行动，给藏族人民带来了真正幸福的曙光，让我们一齐来大声叫好。
    谁知这件事，倒使得住在喜马拉雅山那边的一小批人伤心了，愤慨了，他们鼻涕一把，眼泪一把的，发出一片乱嘈嘈的叫喊声，把人的耳朵都快吵聋了。真奇怪！人们不禁要问：这些大人先生们同西藏的一小撮叛乱分子究竟有什么关系？为什么西藏叛乱的失败，使得他们那么“同情”和“不安”呢？事情很明白：他们是预定要开庆祝会的，结果是白白地花费了一场心思，做了一场可怜的春梦。
    好梦不成，就继之以咒骂。他们想用咒骂的方法，来削弱伟大的中华人民共和国在东方人民中的威信。但是他们的算盘又打错了。中国的强大和飞跃的进步，中国对被压迫民族热情的支持，中国对伟大的印度人民以及东方各国人民友谊的忠实，是长期以来活生生的事实证明了的，这不是用几句咒骂，报纸上发几篇文章，在我大使馆门前喊几句口号，散发一两篇荒诞离奇的声明，就可以从东方人民善良的心中抹得掉的。老实说，今天，如果有谁想利用西藏少数叛乱分子从中渔利，实现自己扩张阴谋的话，他总有一天会后悔的。他迟早会发现，被削弱的不是中华人民共和国的威信，只会使他们自己在人民中更加孤立。
    西藏过去是、现在是、将来也永远是我们伟大祖国的一部分。英帝国主义和印度扩张主义者的阴谋没有用，公开的干涉和咒骂也没有用，这只能使中国人民更深刻地认识一些人，认识一些事，从而激发他们更热烈的爱国主义的感情，促进我们各民族的团结，促进我们伟大祖国的统一和巩固。对于外国干涉者来说，结果也只有一个：这就是在人民面前，现出了他们鼻子上涂着白粉的小花脸，使他们进退维谷，狼狈不堪，威信扫地。可是这又能怨谁呢？他们只能怪自己热昏了头脑，做出了这样的蠢事。
    现在西藏平叛部队正在追歼残匪，藏族人民正在欢庆新生。西藏历史从此出现了云散天开的大好图画。在全世界劳动人民伟大的节日——“五一”，让我们再一次向英勇辛劳的解放军同志们致敬。
