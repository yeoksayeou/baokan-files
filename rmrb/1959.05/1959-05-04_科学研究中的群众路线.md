Comrade Premier Zhou's Government Work Report is an epic summarizing the Great Leap Forward and a bugle call inspiring another leap forward. We firmly believe that the people of all nationalities across the country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, will advance at a heroic pace in all aspects of socialist construction on the basis of the victories already achieved, in accordance with the meticulous plans stipulated by the Central Committee, and achieve even greater victories.

In the year of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, what scientists and educators felt particularly deeply and were excited by was the mass line adopted by our Party for scientific research under the leadership of the Party. This is unimaginable in capitalist countries. This is a bold creation. This is the first time in scientific research that "private ownership" (if we can use the ownership of the means of production as an analogy) has been changed to "socialist collective ownership," and then transitioned to "ownership by the whole people." Its profound impact has already been seen today.

First, it broke down superstitions and liberated thinking. Originally, true science was based on experimentation; it has always been the most powerful weapon to break down superstitions and has never believed in authority. However, the bad habits of superstition and worshipping authority still exist. This is because, although natural phenomena and experimental facts are objectively existing, people's understanding of the facts and their inherent connections varies in depth and breadth with the progress of science. Scientific theories come and go, have the limitations of the times, and have applicable scopes. Recognizing their limitations and distinguishing their applicable scopes will prevent us from generalizing from the partial, and will prevent us from stubbornly adhering to one person's opinion and refusing to accept new things. Otherwise, we will fall into迷途 or excessively worship authority. Another kind of superstition has its class roots. Some bourgeois scientists, especially in their later years, use the authority they have established in narrow fields to step out of their studies or laboratories and say a lot of things that have absolutely nothing to do with their profession, seeing ghosts and gods. And ordinary people, who have never seen ghosts, believe the words of "authorities," and also say they see ghosts. Those "authorities," whether they are intentional or unintentional, have the same result: they serve their ruling class.

Secondly, our countless young people have punctured the "mystery" of scientific research. Scientific research, like all labor, is originally ordinary and pleasant; it is only because we, who came from the semi-feudal and semi-colonial era, were poisoned by bourgeois education and thought that scientific research was only the business of a few people, and did not have the courage or thought to mobilize young people, that it became "mysterious." Old intellectuals must honestly admit this mistake. Today, under the leadership of the Party, no matter how "profound" the theory or how complex the technology, let us all do it. One failure, do it again; another failure, do it again. Success certainly strengthens our confidence, and failure also gives us the lessons we deserve. This will prepare us mentally for future creative research.

The achievements made by adopting the mass line in scientific research are astonishing and can almost be said to be "miraculous." That is a miracle that appeared under the leadership of the Party, in the hard work of young people liberating their minds, and on the basis of the achievements of their predecessors.

Victory is certain. After victory, we must consolidate it and continue to develop it. Scientific research is hereditary. "It must come from oneself, and not copy a single word from predecessors" is just an exaggeration by literati. What others have spent several years doing, we have completed in a few months or even dozens of days. On the one hand, this shows our drive, and on the other hand, it proves the importance of the work of our predecessors. Newton once said that he saw farther than others because he stood on the shoulders of giants of the past.

Our young people have a heroic saying: "What others have, we must have; what others don't have, we must also have." We are already doing the first half; as for doing the second half, it requires greater efforts and long-term continuous work. Speaking of this, Premier Zhou's instructions on the Institute of Social Sciences in his Government Work Report are also crucial for natural scientists. The Premier said: "Social science theorists should be encouraged to conduct systematic, long-term efforts under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, fully grasp relevant materials, and engage in independent and creative research."

"Systematic, independent, and creative research" cannot be achieved by relying solely on shock tactics. Therefore, I am very interested in the far-sighted measure taken by the leading comrades of some universities to put the organization of a research backbone team on the agenda. Combining centralized leadership with carrying out a vigorous mass movement is the source of all our victories. Today, the task facing universities, in terms of scientific research, is how to properly coordinate shock work and regular work, and how to conduct long-term research topics and temporary research topics in a division of labor and cooperation. The research backbone team is no different from other work teams, but appropriate adjustments should be made in terms of manpower allocation, time arrangement, and material support. I firmly believe that the research backbone team under the leadership of the Party will never return to the cold and deserted situation of individual research in the past. It will be the implementation of the mass line, and the necessary force for systematic, independent, and creative research.

We must use the fruits of other people's labor, respect the fruits of other people's labor, but we cannot rely solely on the fruits of other people's labor. We must contribute the fruits of our labor to the general treasury of human culture, so as not to fail the great era in which we live in China, which has never existed in Chinese history.

### 科学研究中的群众路线

    科学研究中的群众路线
    饶毓泰委员的发言
    周总理的政府工作报告是总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角。我们深信，全国各族人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，将在已经取得胜利的基础上，依照中央缜密规定的计划，以豪迈的步伐向着社会主义建设各方面进军，取得更大的胜利。
    在一九五八大跃进之年，作为科学和教育工作者所特别深深感到激动的是我们党所提出的科学研究采取在党领导下的群众路线。这是在资本主义国家中所梦想不到的。这是个大胆的创造。这是在科学研究上第一次把“私人所有制”（如果我们可以用生产资料所有制作比喻的话）改变为“社会主义集体所有制”，并进而过渡到“全民所有制”。它的深远的影响在今天已经看到。
    首先是破除了迷信，解放了思想。本来真正的科学是建立在实验的基础上的；它从来就是破除迷信最有力的武器，从来就不相信权威。然而迷信和崇拜权威的陋习仍然存在。这是因为，虽然自然现象和实验的事实是客观的存在，可是人们对于事实的了解，对于它们内在的联系，却随着科学的进展而异其深度与广度。科学理论，来来去去，有时代的局限性，有适用的范围。认识其局限性，辨别其适用范围，就不致于以偏概全，就不致于固执一先生之说，拒绝接受新鲜事物。反之就会堕入迷途，或者过分崇拜权威。另一种迷信则有其阶级根源。一些资产阶级科学家，特别是在他们暮年，利用他们在狭隘领域里树立起来的权威，走出书斋或实验室，说出一大堆和他们本行绝不相干的话，见鬼见神。而普通人民，本来不曾见过鬼，相信“权威”的话，也就说见鬼了。那些“权威”，不管他们有意或无意，结果都是一样，都是为他们的统治阶级服务的。
    其次是我们无数青年戳穿了科学研究的“神秘”。科学研究和一切劳动一样本是平凡而愉快的；只是由于我们这些从半封建半殖民地时代过来的人受了资产阶级教育的毒害，认为科学研究只是少数人的事业，没有勇气也不曾想到发动青年，便“神秘”起来了。这个过错，旧知识分子要老老实实承认。今天，在党的领导下，不管理论怎样“高深”，技术怎样复杂，让我们大家动手都来碰碰。一次失败，再做；再一次失败，又做。成功固然加强我们的信心，失败也给我们应得的教训。这就为今后创造性的研究作好精神上的准备。
    科学研究采取群众路线所取得的成就是惊人的，几乎可说是“奇迹”似的。那是在党的领导下，在青年人解放思想辛勤工作中、在前人成就的基础上出现的奇迹。
    胜利是肯定的。胜利了，还得巩固，还得继续发展下去。科学研究是有继承性的。“必出于己，不袭前人片言只字”只是文人的过分夸张。人家费几年功夫才做出的；我们在几个月甚至几十天内就完成了。这一方面显示了我们的干劲，另一方面更证明了前人工作的重要性。牛顿曾说过，他比别人看得远些，是因为他站在前代巨人的肩上。
    我们的青年人有句豪语：“别人有的，我们要有；别人没有的，我们也要有。”我们现在已经在做上一半；至于做下一半，那就需要更大的努力、进行长时期的继续不断的工作。说到这里，周总理在他的政府工作报告中关于社会科学研究所给予的指示，对自然科学工作者来说，也是关键性的。总理说：“应当鼓励社会科学理论工作者在马克思列宁主义指导下，进行有系统的、长时间的努力，充分掌握有关的资料，从事独立的、创造性的研究。”
    “有系统的、独立的、创造性的研究”自然不能徒靠突击来进行。因此，我对于有些高等学校领导同志把组织一支研究骨干队伍提到日程上来这一具有远见的措施，十分感到兴趣。集中领导同开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动结合起来，是我们一切胜利的根源。今天高等学校所面临的课题，就科学研究说，是怎样把突击工作和经常工作好好配合起来，怎样把长远的研究题目和临时性的研究题目既分工又合作地进行起来。研究骨干队伍和其他工作队伍没有什么特别处，不过在人力的配备上、时间的安排上、物资的支援上要作适当的调整。我深信，在党领导下的研究骨干队伍决不会回到从前个别作研究时那样冷冷清清的局面。它将是群众路线的贯彻，为有系统的、独立的、创造性的研究所必需具备的力量。
    我们要利用他人劳动的成果，尊重他人劳动的成果，但是不能徒靠他人劳动的成果。我们要在人类文化总库中贡献出我们劳动的成果，庶不辜负我们所处的在中国历史上从来不曾有过的伟大的时代。
