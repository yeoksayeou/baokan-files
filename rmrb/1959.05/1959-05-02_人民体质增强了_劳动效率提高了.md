Comrade Chairman, fellow members:

    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly endorse the reports by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    Nineteen fifty-eight was a year of the Great Leap Forward in our country. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, after the nationwide rectification campaign, on the basis of greatly enhanced socialist and communist consciousness, the six hundred million people of the country achieved brilliant accomplishments and great victories in industrial and agricultural production and in science, culture, and education. As an important component of socialist construction and cultural revolution, sports also saw a surge in mass participation in physical exercise. Like all parts of the country, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, sports have now been popularized in factories, rural areas, schools, shops, government offices, streets, and every corner, forming a mass sports movement. The number of people regularly participating in physical exercise has increased rapidly. The number of people in the city who have passed various levels of the Labor and Defense System has exceeded 130,000, and there are 40,000 athletes who have reached the level of graded athletes. Amateur sports schools for youth have also developed significantly. On the basis of the widespread development of mass sports, the improvement of sports performance has also been rapid, and new records continue to emerge. In international friendly matches, thanks to our study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we once defeated the Azerbaijan Women's Volleyball Team of the Soviet Union. The 100-kilometer cycling (road) race and the naval multi-event heaving line reached world-class results, and the level of other sports has also improved rapidly.

    The tremendous development of sports in 1958, through the practical effects of sports activities, has more powerfully proven that sports are indeed the most active and effective method of enhancing the people's physical fitness, and have played a positive role in socialist construction and national defense construction. For example, the Wuhan Meat Joint Processing Factory has done a good job in developing mass sports, which has played a significant role in increasing the attendance rate. In 1957, the attendance rate of the entire factory was 90%, which increased to 95.7% in 1958, and the annual production target was completed two months ahead of schedule. The athletes of various sports teams in the factory all received production bonuses in 1958. Workers in the mechanical and electrical workshop of the Hankou 201 Factory regularly participate in physical exercise, and the attendance rate reached 100%. Last year, 37 people in the entire workshop were rated as heroes of the factory and district. Due to their consistent adherence to physical exercise and their good health, the Wei Chuanyan team of the Wuchang Shipyard could produce a steel barge in just seven and a half days, while other teams needed eighteen days. Female workers in the Wuchang Zhenhuan Yarn Factory generally felt relaxed and no longer felt tired when patrolling the machines after exercising through the Labor and Defense System. Schools have further developed sports activities. After the implementation of the Labor and Defense System, the students' physical fitness and mental outlook have been renewed, and their academic performance has also improved. After the implementation of the Labor and Defense System, the average daily number of outpatient visits at Wuchang Experimental Middle School decreased by 5%. Hongyi Lane Primary School in Hankou has done a good job in developing sports activities. Eighty percent of the eighty-eight steel teenagers evaluated were athletes and sports activists.

    Through the nationwide rectification campaign and the mass steel production movement, the political and ideological consciousness of sports workers and athletes has been greatly enhanced, and they have further clarified the rationale for sports to serve labor production and national defense construction. The style of sportsmanship has been greatly improved. The communist style of diligent study, hard training, hard work, practical work, clever work, daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has begun to emerge. The impure situation of the team has been greatly changed. All the major changes in political ideology and mental outlook will inevitably produce tremendous material strength, promote the vigorous development of sports and rapid improvement.

    The achievements mentioned above are due to the great vitality of the Party's General Line. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the development of sports has been greatly driven. The vigorous development of sports has effectively promoted the further development of labor productivity, mutual promotion, and continuous development. This shows the correctness of the central authorities' instructions: "The fundamental task of sports in our country is to enhance the people's physical fitness and serve labor production and national defense construction."

    The Great Leap Forward in sports in 1958 is a vivid practice, and we have deeply realized that:

    1.  Closely relying on the leadership of the Party and firmly adhering to political command are the fundamental guarantees for realizing the Great Leap Forward in sports.

        The achievements of sports work in the past year have always been achieved under the leadership and support of party committees at all levels and the implementation of political command. When Wuhan City, Hubei Province, and other parts of the country followed the Party's General Line and formed a high tide of leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee timely discussed sports work and issued a call to immediately transform factories, rural areas, schools, shops, government offices, and streets into mass practical actions, and sports activities became universally active. The production peak of 100,000 people in the city dedicating their efforts to the Party on "July 1st" further inspired and drove the development of sports. At the Municipal Party Committee's conference in August, calling on the people of the city to march towards scientific, technological and cultural revolution, clear instructions were given for sports activities, and party organizations at all levels made comprehensive arrangements, so that sports activities have been further developed. In November, the Municipal Party Committee called for "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward." Party secretaries at all levels personally took command, and leading comrades of party organizations in many units personally participated in physical exercise, so that sports activities further reached the situation of the whole party taking action and the whole people mobilizing. Sports activities are thriving, greatly enriching the content of people's lives, and the level of sports technology has also been further improved.

    Practice has proved that politics is always the soul and commander of all work. In the sports team, we must adhere to political command in order to eliminate conservatism, break superstitions, and develop the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, so that mass sports can develop vigorously and the level of sports technology can be rapidly improved. For example, in the past, some members of the Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory football team would ask for leave for two or three days after a game, and production tasks could not be completed, which made the masses dissatisfied and seriously affected the development of sports activities. In the Great Leap Forward of sports, under the leadership of the Party, a rectification campaign was launched, and the players have undergone significant changes. The production quota was completed by 300%, and the team's technology and style have been improved and transformed, which has won the praise of the masses, and sports activities throughout the factory have also been vigorously developed.

    The cause of sports, like other causes, must be placed under the absolute leadership and unified arrangement of the Party, and resolutely adhere to political command, in order to organize the masses and realize the comprehensive leap forward of sports. There are still bourgeois ideologies and viewpoints among the bourgeois intellectuals among our sports workers and athletes, and there is a struggle between two ideologies and two roads in sports work. In the past, bourgeois rightists believed that "the Party can only manage politics, not lead technology and business," "laymen cannot lead experts," and "even if politics is not in command, you can still win the championship." They admitted defeat in the face of the iron facts of the past year. The establishment of the Party's absolute leadership and resolute political command is the fundamental guarantee for realizing the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in sports.

    2.  Adapting to the requirements of the broad masses of working people for enhancing physical fitness in the Great Leap Forward in production, fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, implementing the mass line, and implementing walking on two legs are the basic line and basic methods for widely developing mass sports.

        In the cause of socialist construction, under the situation of comprehensive leap forward in various tasks, sports work must also fully mobilize the masses, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, create a vigorous momentum and a down-to-earth style, in order to achieve great achievements. Sports activities should be carried out on the basis of consciousness and willingness, adopt diverse and varied sports activities, and adhere to the principle of popularization and improvement, in order to attract more people to participate in sports activities and adhere to exercise. Only by adhering to regular exercise can we enhance physical fitness, improve technology, and make sports widely developed and the level of sports technology continuously improved. Developing mass sports on a large scale and following the mass line is the unswerving principle for developing sports.

    Our sports achievements are enormous, and our experiences are profound. In the practice of the Great Leap Forward in sports, because our sports workers have not been effective and timely enough in implementing the Party Central Committee's policies and the State Sports Commission's instructions; the mass work has not been hard, deep, and meticulous enough; and we have not seriously summarized the experiences and lessons learned. Therefore, it is far from adapting to the requirements of the broad masses of working people for enhancing physical fitness in the current Great Leap Forward in production, the level of sports technology is still backward, and the spiritual outlook of the sports team has not been completely changed. These shortcomings must be overcome, and the shortcomings must be transformed into advantages, and negative factors must be turned into positive factors, so that sports activities can be carried out healthily and widely, and the level of technology will also be rapidly improved.

    The task of sports work in 1959 is very glorious and arduous. In order to further adapt to the requirements of the broad masses of working people for enhancing physical fitness in the Great Leap Forward in production, and to better serve the completion of the 1959 national economic grand plan. On the basis of the achievements in 1958, under the unified leadership and comprehensive arrangement of the Party, the 1959 sports work should resolutely implement political command, further muster our efforts, strive for the upstream, break conservatism, combine the revolutionary soaring vigor with the spirit of scientific analysis, implement the principle of combining popularization and improvement, widely develop mass sports, and strive for sports to obtain a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Actively prepare for participation in the First National Games, strive to create excellent results in the National Games, and dedicate ourselves to the tenth anniversary of our great motherland - the People's Republic of China!

    I wish the conference a successful victory!

    I wish all the members good health!

### 人民体质增强了　劳动效率提高了

    人民体质增强了　劳动效率提高了
    孙耀华委员谈武汉市开展群众性体育活动的情况主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和衷心地拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和中国人民政治协商会议李维汉副主席的报告。
    一九五八年是我国大跃进的一年。全国六亿多人民在中国共产党和毛主席英明的领导下，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，经过全民整风运动，在社会主义和共产主义觉悟大大提高的基础上，工、农业生产和科学、文化、教育等方面都获得了辉煌的成就和伟大的胜利。作为社会主义建设和文化革命重要内容之一的体育运动，也出现了全民参加体育锻炼的热潮。我们湖北省武汉市和全国各地一样，目前体育运动已普及到工厂、农村、学校、商店、机关、街道，直到每个角落，形成了全民性的体育运动，经常参加体育锻炼的人数增涨很快，全市通过各级劳卫制的已超过十三万人，达到等级运动员的有四万人；青、少年业余体育学校也有很大的发展。在群众性体育运动广泛开展的基础上，各项运动成绩的提高也很快，新纪录不断涌现。在国际友谊比赛中，由于我们学习了苏联的先进经验，曾经战胜过苏联阿塞拜疆女子排球队，百公里自行车（公路）竞赛、航海多项撇缆达到了世界优秀成绩，其他运动水平也有很快的提高。
    一九五八年体育运动巨大的发展，通过体育活动的实践的效果更有力地证明了：体育运动确是增强人民体质的一种最积极最有效的方法，对社会主义建设和国防建设，都起到了良好积极的作用。例如：武汉肉类联合加工厂开展群众性体育运动较好，对提高出勤率起了很大的作用，一九五七年全厂出勤率为百分之九十，一九五八年提高到百分之九十五点七，并且提前两个月完成了全年的生产指标。该厂各种体育代表队的运动员都获得了一九五八年的生产奖金。汉口二○一工厂机电车间的职工经常参加体育锻炼，出勤率达到百分之一百，去年全车间有三十七人被评为厂和区里的功臣。武昌造船厂卫传炎小组由于一贯坚持体育锻炼，身体强健，在生产上别的小组要十八天生产一条钢驳，他们只要七天半就完成了。武昌震寰纱厂的女工通过劳卫制锻炼后，普遍感到身体轻松，车档里跑巡回不再感到吃力。学校里进一步开展体育活动，经过推行劳卫制锻炼后，学生体质和精神面貌一新，学习成绩也有所提高。武昌实验中学在推行劳卫制锻炼后，平均每天门诊减少百分之五，汉口洪益巷小学开展体育活动较好。评定八十八名钢铁少年，有百分之八十是运动员和体育积极分子。
    通过全民整风以及大办钢铁运动，体育工作者和运动员的政治思想觉悟有了很大的提高，进一步明确了体育为劳动生产，为国防建设服务的道理；体育道德作风有了很大的改进；开始出现了勤学苦炼，苦干、实干、巧干，敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格；队伍不纯的情况大大改变。所有一切在政治思想上、精神面貌上的重大改变，必然将产生巨大的物质力量，促使体育运动蓬勃发展和迅速的提高。
    以上成绩的取得是由于党的总路线发挥了巨大的生命力。在工、农业的大跃进形势下，大大地带动了体育运动的发展，体育运动蓬蓬勃勃的发展，有力地推动了劳动生产率更进一步的发展，相互促进，不断发展的结果，这显示着党中央指示：“我国体育运动的根本任务是增强人民体质，为劳动生产和国防建设服务”的方针的正确性。
    一九五八年体育运动大跃进是一个生动的实践，我们深刻地体会到：
    一、紧紧依靠党的领导、坚决政治挂帅，是实现体育运动大跃进的根本保证。
    一年来体育工作的成绩，始终是在各级党委领导与支持下，贯彻政治挂帅所取得的。当湖北省武汉市和全国各地一样遵循着党的总路线，形成工、农业生产跃进高潮的时候，中共武汉市委及时地讨论了体育工作，并提出号召，在工厂、农村、学校、商店、机关、街道立即变为群众实际行动，体育运动普遍活跃起来，真是满园春色、气象万千。全市“七一”十万人向党献礼的生产高峰，进一步鼓舞和带动了体育运动向前发展。八月间市委号召全市人民向科学技术与文化革命进军大会上，对体育运动作了明确的指示，各级党组织作了全面安排，体育运动有了更进一步的发展。十一月间市委号召
  “以钢为纲，全面跃进”，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，很多单位党组织领导同志亲自参加体育锻炼，使体育运动进一步达到全党动手，全民动员的局面，体育运动欣欣向荣，大大丰富了人民生活内容，运动技术水平也有了进一步的提高。
    实践证明：政治永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。在体育队伍中必须政治挂帅，才能扫除保守，破除迷信，发挥敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，才能使群众性体育运动蓬蓬勃勃发展，运动技术水平迅速提高。例如：武汉机床附件厂足球队，过去有的队员赛一场球后，请假两、三天，生产任务不能完成，群众不满，严重地影响体育活动的开展。在体育大跃进中，在党的领导下，开展了整风，队员都有了显著的转变，生产完成了定额300％，球队技术与作风有了提高和转变，获得了群众的表扬，全厂体育活动也蓬蓬勃勃的开展起来。
    体育事业和其他事业一样必须置于党的绝对领导统一安排下，坚决政治挂帅，才能组织群众，实现体育全面大跃进。我们体育工作者和运动员中的资产阶级知识分子还存在着资产阶级思想和观点，在体育工作中存在两种思想、两条道路的斗争。过去资产阶级右派分子认为：“党只能管政治，不能领导技术业务”，“外行不能领导内行”，“政治不挂帅，照样得冠军”。他们在一年来铁的事实面前认输了。确立了党的绝对领导，坚决政治挂帅是实现体育全面大跃进的根本保证。
    二、适应生产大跃进中广大劳动人民对增强体质的要求，充分发动群众，依靠群众，贯彻群众路线，实行两条腿走路，是广泛开展群众性体育运动的基本路线和基本方法。
    在社会主义建设事业中，在各项工作全面跃进的形势下，体育工作也必须充分发动群众，动员群众的积极性和创造性，造成轰轰烈烈的声势和踏踏实实的作风，才能取得巨大的成绩。体育运动应该在自觉自愿的基础上开展起来，采取多种、多样的体育活动，坚持普及和提高的方针，才能吸引更多的人参加体育活动，坚持锻炼，只有坚持经常的锻炼，才能增强体质，提高技术，才能使体育运动广泛开展和运动技术水平不断提高。体育运动必须大搞群众运动，走群众路线，是开展体育性体育运动坚定不移的方针。
    我们的体育运动的成绩是巨大的，体会也是深刻的。在体育大跃进的实践中由于我们体育工作者在贯彻党中央的方针和国家体委的指示不够有力及时；群众工作不够艰苦、深入、细致；也没有认真总结经验教训。因此，与当前生产大跃进中广大劳动人民对增强体质的要求远远不相适应，运动技术水平还是落后的；体育队伍的精神面貌还没有彻底改观。这些缺点必须设法克服，把缺点转化为优点，变消极因素为积极因素，使体育运动健康地、广泛地开展，技术水平也将迅速提高。
  一九五九年的体育工作的任务是十分光荣而艰巨的。为了进一步适应生产大跃进中广大劳动人民对于增强体质的要求，更好地为完成一九五九年国民经济宏伟计划服务。一九五九年的体育工作应当在一九五八年的成就的基础上，在党的统一领导全面安排下，坚决贯彻政治挂帅，进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，打破保守，把革命的冲天干劲与科学分析的精神结合起来，贯彻执行普及和提高相结合的方针，广泛开展群众性体育运动，争取体育运动获得更大、更好、更全面的大跃进。积极作好参加第一届全国运动会的准备工作，争取在全运会上创造优异的成绩，向我们伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国十周年献礼！
    祝大会胜利成功！
    祝全体委员身体健康！
