Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 8th. The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Affairs" published on the 8th the Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov's answer to the newspaper's questions regarding Greece's strengthening of its war preparations and the plan to establish missile weapon launching bases on its territory.

　　In answering the above questions, Yugov pointed out that the establishment of rocket bases in Greek territory will undoubtedly harm the normal development of relations between the Balkan countries, hinder the restoration of trust between them, and the expansion of economic and cultural cooperation.

　　He said that the Balkans needs peace even more, so that the Balkan people can devote themselves to creative labor and develop their economy and culture. The establishment of rocket bases in Greek territory only benefits the imperialist blocs.

　　Yugov pointed out that certain Greek newspapers have been talking about the so-called "threat from the North" to Greece, and openly propagating that it comes from Bulgaria. He said that similar arguments are not new, and their purpose is nothing more than to oppose Bulgaria, to "prove" that the special military measures taken on Greek territory are due to some kind of "threat" and are inevitable, and to aggravate the tense situation in the Balkans.

　　Yugov pointed out that the real threat to Balkan peace is Greece's policy of war preparations and the policy of establishing missile bases on Greek territory. He said that Greece's neighbors cannot remain indifferent to these measures that endanger peace.

    于哥夫答“工人事业报”编辑部问
    希腊建立火箭基地只有利于帝国主义
    新华社索非亚电　保加利亚“工人事业报”8日刊登了保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫回答这家报纸向他提出的关于希腊正在加强备战活动和在它的领土上建立发射导弹武器基地的计划问题。
    于哥夫在回答上述问题时指出，在希腊领土上建立火箭基地，毫无疑问，将会给巴尔干各国关系的正常发展带来危害，妨碍它们相互间信任的恢复，和经济、文化合作的扩大。
  他说，巴尔干更需要的是和平，以便巴尔干人民能致力于创造性的劳动，发展经济和文化。而在希腊领土上建立火箭基地只对帝国主义集团有利。
    于哥夫指出，某些希腊报纸高谈什么希腊存在着“来自北方的威胁”，并且公开宣扬说，这是来自保加利亚。他说，类似论调已非第一次了，其目的无非是为了反对保加利亚，为了“证明”在希腊领土上进行的特别军事措施是由于某种“威胁”，而是不可避免的，为了加剧巴尔干的紧张局势。
    于哥夫指出，真正威胁巴尔干和平的是希腊的备战政策和在希腊领土上建立导弹基地的政策。他说，希腊的邻国对于这些危及和平的措施不能置之不理。
