　　Fighting to Eradicate the Locust Plague
　　Commentator of this Newspaper
　　Locusts are a major enemy of crops in the coastal and waterlogged areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. To ensure a leap forward in agricultural production in these areas, we must strive to completely eradicate the locust plague in the next few years.

　　Before liberation, under reactionary rule, farmland cultivation was extensive, water conservancy was neglected, and there was no work to control or exterminate locusts. Therefore, a locust plague would occur every few years, seriously threatening agricultural production. In 1927, sixty-nine counties in Shandong Province experienced locusts, displacing 70,000 people and forcing them to flee famine. After liberation, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, the people in the relevant areas launched mass, continuous locust extermination campaigns and achieved great victories. In most areas, the density of insect populations has been greatly reduced over large areas, guaranteeing agricultural harvests; in some places, the area affected by locusts has steadily declined, and advanced areas close to eradicating locust plagues have emerged. After years of hard work, we have also mastered the laws of locust occurrence and accumulated a relatively complete set of experiences. These are extremely favorable conditions for eradicating locust plagues in the future.

　　The Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui five-province locust eradication conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture not long ago focused on studying the issue of eradicating locust plagues and drafted a draft implementation plan for the five provinces to eradicate locust plagues. Everyone believes that eradicating locust plagues is not only necessary, but also completely possible to strive to eradicate locust plagues completely in four to five years, or slightly longer, in terms of various conditions. Through years of prevention and control, a lot of typical experience in eradicating locusts has been accumulated, setting an example for eradicating locust plagues. The area affected by locusts in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, was reduced from 170,000 mu in 1952 to more than 3,300 mu in 1958. In the past, the area of flying locusts in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, exceeded one million mu; after years of prevention and control, it has been reduced to more than 300,000 mu. In addition, the establishment of people's communes is more conducive to rationally mobilizing manpower, financial resources, and materials for locust extermination. Changes in the cultivation system and cultivation techniques, as well as the gradual realization of water conservancy, river networkization, garden-like fields, and afforestation, have created favorable conditions for eliminating locust breeding bases. As long as under the unified leadership of the Party, the broad masses are mobilized, with the vigor of "eliminating the four pests", using existing experience, utilizing all favorable factors, and adopting various effective methods, we will definitely be able to eradicate locust plagues in the coming years.

　　Strategically, we must despise the enemy, but tactically, we must value the enemy. It must be seen that eradicating locust plagues is still an arduous task, and we must not underestimate the enemy. Locusts are widely distributed in China. According to preliminary statistics, the locust areas in the five provinces involve 179 counties, and the area where locust plagues occur perennially is about 10 million to 15 million mu, which can be expanded to 30 million to 40 million mu in flood years. The locust activity and natural environment in various places are also different, so the locust extermination measures are also different. These are all difficulties in eradicating locust plagues. Difficulties exist in any work, and difficulties can always be overcome in the face of revolutionaries; the way to overcome them is to strengthen leadership and mobilize the masses.

　　The battle to eradicate locust plagues must be carried out simultaneously from two aspects: both vigorously attacking and cleverly eliminating locusts, and eliminating locust breeding bases. The reason why locusts have existed and are rampant for a long time is that, firstly, locusts have strong reproductive power and adaptability, and secondly, there are a large number of natural environments suitable for locusts to inhabit and reproduce. Therefore, on the one hand, we must vigorously eliminate flying locusts; on the other hand, we must actively transform the natural environment conducive to locust breeding. If we relax the prevention and control of existing locusts, they will become a disaster and continue to expand the locust area if conditions are suitable, affecting current agricultural production; if we ignore the elimination of locust breeding bases, it will be difficult to eradicate them. 1959 is the first year of implementing the locust eradication plan, and we must take advantage of the victory to advance on the basis of last year's locust extermination work. We must greatly reduce the area affected by locusts and create more locust-free counties, cities, and people's communes. This is of great significance for guaranteeing a greater agricultural harvest this year, and it can also lay a good foundation for realizing the locust eradication plan and completely solving the locust plague problem left over from thousands of years.

　　To win a complete victory in the fight against locust plagues in 1959, we must mobilize the masses and launch a large-scale mass movement. We must widely and deeply publicize the necessity and possibility of eradicating locust plagues, so that every household knows and everyone knows. We must inspire greater enthusiasm through debates, calculations, recollections, and comparisons, and fight to the end to eradicate locust plagues. It is also necessary to formulate locust eradication plans level by level as a program of action. It is necessary to formulate both long-term plans and annual plans. In particular, the 1959 plan must be formulated quickly. In addition to provinces and counties with locusts formulating plans, people's communes and production teams in the locust area should also formulate their own plans, and the locust extermination plan should be included in the agricultural production plan of the community and team. It is also necessary to establish and improve the necessary command and professional institutions in the locust control work, and do a good job in insect situation forecasting and early warning. In the case of insufficient labor and medicines and machinery, it is even more necessary to rationally arrange labor, vigorously grasp tool reforms, make full use of native pesticides, and solve the contradiction between locust extermination and other farm work.

　　The summer locust outbreak season is approaching, and we must make all preparations as soon as possible, work hard, work practically, and work cleverly for a year, fire the first shot in eradicating locust plagues, and lay a good foundation for realizing the great task of eradicating locust plagues.

　　为根除蝗害而战
　　本报评论员
    蝗虫是我国冀、鲁、豫、苏、皖沿海及内涝地区农作物的重要敌人。为了确保这些地区农业生产的跃进，必须力争在最近几年内彻底根除蝗害。
    解放以前，在反动统治下，农田耕作粗放，水利失修，更谈不上治蝗灭蝗工作。因此，每隔不了几年，就会发生一次蝗灾，严重威胁农业生产。1927年，山东省有六十九个县发生飞蝗，使七万百人流离失所，四处逃荒。解放后，有关地区人民在各级党委和政府的领导下，开展了群众性的连续不断的灭蝗运动，取得了巨大胜利。大部地区已经在大面积上大大压低了虫口密度，保证了农业的丰收；有些地方有蝗面积稳定下降，并出现了接近根除蝗害的先进地区。经过连年的苦战，我们也掌握了蝗虫发生的规律，积累了比较完整的一套经验。这是今后根除蝗害的极为有利的条件。
    不久以前农业部召开的冀、鲁、豫、苏、皖五省灭蝗会议，着重研究了根除蝗害的问题，并拟定了五省根除蝗害的实施规划草案。大家认为，根除蝗害不但是必要的，而且就各方面的条件来说，力争四年到五年或者稍长一点的时间彻底根除蝗害也是完全可能的。经过连年的防治，已积累了很多根除蝗虫的典型经验，给根除蝗害树立了榜样。山东省高唐县蝗虫面积由1952年的十七万亩压缩到1958年三千三百多亩。河北省丰润县过去飞蝗发生面积一百多万亩；经过连年防治，已减少到三十多万亩。加之人民公社的成立，更加有利于合理调动人力、财力、物力进行灭蝗斗争。耕作制度、耕作技术的改变，以及水利化、河网化、园田化、园林化的逐步实现，都为消灭蝗虫孳生基地创造了有利条件。只要在党的统一领导下，发动广大群众，以“除四害”的干劲，运用已有的经验，利用一切有利因素，采取各种有效的方法，猛攻巧打，一定能在最近几年内根除蝗害。
    在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上又要重视敌人。必须看到，根除蝗害还是一个艰巨的任务，不能轻敌。我国蝗虫分布很广，据初步统计，五省蝗区涉及一百七十九个县，常年发生蝗害的面积大约一千万到一千五百万亩，洪水年份可扩大到三千万到四千万亩。各地蝗虫活动情况和自然环境又各不相同，因之灭蝗的措施也不相同。这都是根除蝗害的困难。困难是在任何工作中都会有的，在革命者的面前困难也总是可以克服的；克服它的办法就是加强领导，发动群众。
    根除蝗害的战斗要从两方面同时进行：既要猛攻巧打大力消灭蝗虫，又要消灭蝗虫发生基地。蝗虫长期存在和猖獗的原因，其一是蝗虫繁殖力强、适应力强，其二是适宜蝗虫栖息繁殖的自然环境大量存在。因此，一方面必须大力消灭飞蝗；另方面必须积极改造有利于蝗虫孳生的自然环境。如果放松现有蝗虫的防治，条件适宜就会成灾和继续扩大蝗区面积，影响当前的农业生产；如果忽视消灭蝗虫发生基地，就很难作到根除。1959年是执行根除蝗害规划的第一年，必须在去年灭蝗工作的基础上，乘胜前进。要大大压缩蝗区面积，创造更多的无蝗害县、市和人民公社。这对于保证今年的农业更大丰收有重要意义，也可以为实现根除蝗害规划、彻底解决几千年遗留下来的蝗害问题奠定良好基础。
    要赢得1959年对蝗害作战的全胜，必须发动群众，大搞群众运动。必须广泛深入地宣传根除蝗害的必要性和可能性，作到家喻户晓，人人皆知。要通过辩论、算账、回忆、对比，鼓起更大的干劲，为根除蝗害而斗争到底。还必须逐级制定根除蝗害的规划，作为行动纲领。既要制定长期规划，也要制定分年度的规划。特别是1959年的规划，要迅速制定出来。除了有蝗省、县要制定规划以外，蝗区的人民公社、生产队都应当制定自己的规划，并且要把灭蝗规划列入本社、本队农业生产计划。还要建立和健全治蝗工作中必要的指挥和专业机构，作好虫情预测预报工作。在劳力和药械不足的情况下，更要合理安排劳动力，大抓工具改革，充分利用土农药，并解决灭蝗同其他农活的矛盾。
    夏蝗发生时期就要到来了，我们必须及早作好一切准备工作，苦干、实干、巧干一年，打响根除蝗害的第一炮，为实现根除蝗害的伟大任务打下良好的基础。
