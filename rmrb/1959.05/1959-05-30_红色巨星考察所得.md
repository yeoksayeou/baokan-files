    Findings from Red Giant Star Exploration
    High-Altitude Gas Molecules
      Above 1000 Degrees Celsius
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 28th: Soviet artificial satellites have detected that at an altitude of 500 kilometers above the ground, the temperature of gas molecules reaches the melting point of steel, namely 1500 to 1700 degrees Celsius. At an altitude of 300 kilometers above the ground, the temperature of gas molecules is also as high as 1000 degrees Celsius. This was stated by Soviet Academician Danilin in an article published in the latest issue of "Youth Technology" magazine.
    The article states that, however, rockets, artificial satellites, or spacecraft launched to this altitude will not reach such high temperatures. This is because, at such high altitudes, the gas density is extremely low, and the speed of rockets, satellites, etc. is very high. Their temperature is mainly determined by the solar energy they receive, as well as the light energy reflected by the Earth and the lower atmosphere.
  The Intensity of Original Cosmic Rays is Relatively Low
  With More Nuclei of Light Elements
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th: Soviet scientists have recently discovered some new materials about cosmic rays through high-altitude exploration by artificial satellites and cosmic rockets.
    According to the materials recorded by the Cherenkovsky counter on the Soviet cosmic rocket, the intensity of the original cosmic rays is relatively low, with a total of only two particles per second per square centimeter, and their average energy is 10 billion electron volts.
    The materials recorded by the Soviet cosmic rocket also confirmed previous materials, that there are nuclei of light elements, primarily hydrogen nuclei, in cosmic rays. The materials recorded by the instruments on the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite indicate that it encountered an average of 1.2 heavy nuclei of chlorine per minute during its operation, while only one nucleus heavier than chlorine was encountered in several days and nights. This shows that very heavy nuclei streams are rare at high altitudes.

    红色巨星考察所得
    高空气体分子
      摄氏千度以上
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联人造卫星探测出在距离地面五百公里的高空中，气体分子的温度达到钢的熔点，即摄氏一千五百度到一千七百度。而在距地面三百公里高空中的气体分子，也有一千度的高温。这是苏联老科学院士达尼林发表在最近一期“青年技术”杂志上的一篇文章中说的。
    文章说，但是，发射到这个高度的火箭、人造卫星、或宇宙飞船却不致于达到这样高的温度，因为，在这样的高空中，气体密度极小，同时火箭、卫星等运行速度很大，它们的温度基本上是它们受到的太阳光能以及地球和低层大气反射的光能决定的。
  原始宇宙线强度较小
  其中轻元素的核较多
    新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联科学家最近通过人造卫星和宇宙火箭的高空探测，发现了一些关于宇宙线的新材料。
    根据苏联宇宙火箭上契连科夫斯基计数器上记录的材料，表明原始宇宙线的强度是比较小的，每秒钟在每平方公分的面积上总共才两个粒子，它们的平均能量是一百亿电子伏特。
    苏联宇宙火箭记录的材料还证实了过去已有的材料，宇宙线中有轻元素的核，首先是氢的核存在。苏联第三个人造卫星上的仪器记录的材料表明，它在运行中遇到的氯的重原子核平均每分钟一点二个，而比氯更重的原子核在几昼夜之间才遇到一个。这说明非常重的原子核流在高空是很少的。
