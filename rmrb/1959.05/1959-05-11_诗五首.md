    Five Poems
    Yu Pingbo
    In a Jinpu Train
    Rocking in the carriage, I mistook it for home, unaware that I was already at the edge of the world. The Yellow River and Huai River, like a belt of water, with rapeseed flowers yellow and green, and willows sprouting.

    Written on the walls of Five Old Men Village and Hanfu New Village in Nanjing City, formerly a sewage-filled depression, now built into small gardens. A Quatrain.
    The power of the Party and the masses is unprecedented, human replacing heaven, creating a myriad of new things in springtime. The sewage is leveled, lotuses emerge from the water, a hundred flowers bloom, creating two new villages.

    From Jinling to Yangzhou for the first time, recalling my brother Zhu Peixian
    Years ago, we casually spoke of Yangzhou's beauty, the city and its weeping willows, I imagined. In my late years, I visit as a mere traveler, thinking of the old days with you at Huanglu. (At the time, I traveled with Sheng Tao and Boxiang)

    Inscribed and presented to the Dongfeng People's Commune in Lianshui County. Celebrating the news that the river network system will be implemented throughout the county.
    Water boundaries crisscross like a chessboard, the network of veins connected, irrigating fields and draining floods, bringing joyful harvests. I see thatched cottages turning into grand houses, flowers, fruits, mulberry trees, and forests shining green and red.

    On the way back to Beijing
    I only just felt spring return, then it was spring again, dreams of misty rain, dust in my eyes. Youth seems to be reversed, peach petals fall, and apricot buds are new.

    诗五首
    俞平伯
    津浦车中
    摇宕车茵误在家，不知身已在天涯。河淮长江衣带水，菜花黄绿柳舒芽。
    南京城内五老村、汉府新村，昔为污水洼，今建小花园，题赠绝句
    党群伟力无前古，人代天工万象春。污水沙平莲出水，百花齐放两新村。
    自金陵初至扬州，追怀朱佩弦兄
    昔年闲话维扬胜，城郭垂杨想望中。迟暮来游称过客，黄垆思旧与君同。（时与圣陶伯祥同行）
    题赠涟水县东风人民公社。詠河网化闻将推行于全县云
    水界碁枰网脉通，灌畦排涝乐年丰。眼看茅舍成华屋，花果桑林绿映红。
    归京途中
    才觉春回又勒春，梦中烟雨眼中尘。韶华亦似为颠倒，桃瓣飘残杏蕊新。
