    Soviet Scholars Emphasize the Importance of Logical Science Research

    According to a report in the Soviet journal "Problems of Philosophy" this March, a working conference on formal logical science research was held last year at Moscow University, attended by logic experts from Moscow and other regions of the Soviet Union, to discuss issues concerning scientific research and teaching in logic. The report stated that the conference emphasized the increasing role of formal logic, especially mathematical logic, in modern science, technology, and national education. At the same time, it pointed out serious shortcomings in Soviet research on logic and the training of personnel. For example, there are too few people researching mathematical logic, and the research problems are too narrow. Rapidly developing logical branches such as probability logic, program logic, semantics, and problems related to information machines and machine translation have not been noticed by mathematicians, and many logicians ignore modern logical problems. The conference believed that it is necessary to strengthen the training of personnel and seriously emphasize courses in mathematics and mathematical logic. The conference proposed the required and elective courses that should be offered by university logic departments and groups, and passed the following resolutions: 1. The Soviet Ministry of Higher Education is advised to consider the issue of logic personnel training, first of all by establishing logic departments and reforming the work of the philosophy department of Moscow University in training logicians, as well as establishing advanced training classes for logic teachers; 2. Relevant departments are advised to publish journals on the theory and application of logic; 3. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education are advised to convene large-scale academic conferences on the theory and application of logic; 4. In view of the tasks and requirements put forward by the development of mathematical logic, thirty-six reference topics for scientific research have been formulated and are recommended for adoption.

    苏联学者强调逻辑科学研究的重要性
    根据苏联“哲学问题”杂志今年3月号的报道，去年在莫斯科大学召开的，有莫斯科和苏联其他地区逻辑学专家参加的形式逻辑科学研究工作会议上，讨论了关于逻辑学的科学研究和教学工作问题。据报道，会议强调了形式逻辑，特别是数理逻辑对现代科学技术和国民教育的日益增长的作用，同时也指出了苏联在逻辑学的研究和干部培养方面的严重缺点，例如，研究数理逻辑的人员太少，研究的问题太狭，现在急速发展起来的逻辑部门，如概率逻辑、程式逻辑、语义学，以及信息机器和机器翻译等问题，未为数学家们所注意，很多逻辑学家忽视现代的逻辑问题。会议认为需要加强干部的培养工作，和认真重视数学和数理逻辑的课程。会议提出了大学逻辑系、组应该开设的必修科目和选修科目，并通过下列决议：一、建议苏联高教部考虑逻辑学干部培养问题，首先是设立逻辑系和改革莫斯科大学哲学系培养逻辑学家的工作，以及设立逻辑学师资进修班；二、建议有关方面出版逻辑学理论和应用方面的期刊；三、建议苏联科学院和高教部召开有关逻辑理论与应用问题的大型学术会议；四、鉴于数理逻辑的发展所提出的任务和要求，拟定了三十六个科学研究的参考题目，建议采用。
