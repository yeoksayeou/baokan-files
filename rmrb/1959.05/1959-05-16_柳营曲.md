    Willow Camp Tune
         —After seeing the ballet "Notre-Dame de Paris" at the Moscow Ballet Theater
    So much hatred, no need to speak. Ballet can teach tragedy to be passed down. The insidiousness under the power of God, the suffering in the back alleys, stir the heartstrings one by one. See the light lift and flutter in the palm, be amazed by the tiptoes' rapid and spinning dance. The body feels as if outside the willow, the spirit moves before the moon and flowers. It is a flying fairy, flying down from the ninth heaven.

    柳营曲 　 前人
    ——莫斯科芭蕾舞剧院观演“巴黎圣母院”
    多少恨、不须言。芭蕾舞能教悲剧传。神权下的阴险，陋巷里的熬煎，一一激心弦。看掌中轻举翩翩，惊足尖急奏旋旋。身疑风柳外，神动月花前。是飞天，飞下九重天。
