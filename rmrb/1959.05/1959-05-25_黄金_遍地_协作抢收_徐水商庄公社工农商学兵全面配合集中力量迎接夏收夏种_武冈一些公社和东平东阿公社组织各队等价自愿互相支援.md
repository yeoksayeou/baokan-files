“Gold” Everywhere: Collaborative Rush Harvest
	Shangzhuang Commune in Xushui Fully Coordinates Industry, Agriculture, Commerce, Education, and Military to Concentrate Forces for Summer Harvest and Planting
	Some Communes in Wugang and Dongping Dong'e Communes Organize Teams for Equal Value, Voluntary Mutual Support

	This newspaper, Tianjin, 24th – The Shangzhuang People's Commune in Xushui County, Hebei Province, is giving full play to the superiority of the commune system, organizing large-scale collaboration between industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military to launch a concentrated assault on late-stage wheat management and preparations for the summer harvest and planting.

	The Shangzhuang Commune has planted a total of 4,550 mu of winter wheat this year. Although this spring's lack of rain and drought have had some impact on wheat production, the wheat is still growing better than in previous years due to the members' hard work and improved water conservancy conditions. In order to ensure a good harvest and planting this year, the Commune Party Committee, based on the favorable conditions of collectivization, has organized large-scale collaboration between industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military to prepare for the summer harvest and planting. In addition to drawing more than 2,000 laborers and more than 20 powered machines from the logistics departments to support wheat field management and harvest and planting preparations, the entire commune is also giving full play to the superiority of the five-in-one system of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military, mobilizing the forces of various departments such as industry, commerce, schools, the militia, and hospitals to carry out comprehensive large-scale collaboration and support each other in all aspects.

	The commune's chemical plant, machinery repair plant, and tractor station, among other units, dispatched eight powered machines to help with watering, and also drew 60 skilled workers to form a repair team. Equipped with their own tools and parts, they were assigned responsibility for checking and repairing machines in different areas. In just ten days, they helped the production teams repair 45 powered machines, 156 waterwheels, and more than 250 other water-lifting tools in a timely manner. The commune's commercial units also dispatched procurement teams to promptly transport and supply 19 tons of gasoline, coal, and fertilizer. At the same time, 24 cadres and staff members were drawn to go deep into the production teams and groups in conjunction with supply and marketing operations, assisting the team and group cadres in leading late-stage wheat field management and preparations for the summer harvest and planting. The 1,200 older students from the commune's primary and secondary schools also used their labor time to help out in the fields. The commune hospital organized medical teams to go deep into the fields, providing medical care while laboring, supporting the struggle for a bumper summer harvest.

	At present, the rush harvest and wheat protection organizations of the communes and teams have been established, and roads for transporting wheat, threshing grounds, and warehouses for storing wheat are being actively prepared. In addition to continuing to support late-stage wheat management, the industrial sector is also actively rushing to manufacture sickles to ensure that every laborer has a harvesting tool. The commercial sector is also actively preparing reed mats and pesticides for the summer harvest and planting. The wheat harvesting and gleaning teams in the schools are also being actively organized.

	This newspaper reports that Wugang, Hunan, has more than 91,000 mu of spring-harvested crops such as wheat and rapeseed this year, with generally abundant harvests. In order to bring the fruits of the abundant harvest home and ensure timely rice transplanting, the county party committee has adopted measures to organize collaboration and launch a concentrated rush harvest. During the most tense stage, more than 32,000 people throughout the county participated in the rush harvesting of rapeseed. As of May 11, more than 54,900 mu of rapeseed throughout the county had been completely cut, rushed home in the rain, and threshed, without suffering any losses due to the rain. Now, they are pressing forward with a single breath, taking advantage of the victory to organize the rush harvesting of wheat.

	During the summer harvest, some areas have very heavy harvesting and planting tasks and are very short of labor. The county party committee instructed them to adopt the method of equal value exchange to provide collaborative support. The Zhuanwan Commune has more than 8,100 mu of rapeseed, concentrated in ten large teams. The task is heavy and they cannot manage it all. The Taling Brigade needs to transplant 2,100 mu of mid-season rice, of which rapeseed fields account for 1,343 mu, or 64% of the entire mid-season rice fields. The entire brigade has only 530 people. If they rely on themselves to do it alone, they will not be able to complete the task in half a month. In order to ensure the overall victory of rush harvesting and rush planting, the commune party committee convened a meeting of the brigade general branch secretaries, especially explaining the importance of mutual support and collaboration, and that equal value exchange must be implemented in the collaboration to achieve voluntary mutual benefit. Everyone expressed their support. This collaboration generally takes two forms: one is to organize collaboration internally within the brigade. Generally, the methods of assigning people, assigning fields, assigning quality, assigning leadership, and assigning wages are adopted, directly contracting the work to the supporting teams and determining the remuneration. Six brigades and twenty-one production teams have adopted this method, supporting 1,740 people, rushing to harvest more than 1,500 mu of rapeseed, and rushing to plow 1,110 mu and transplant mid-season rice. The second is to organize collaboration between brigades, with the brigade uniformly contracting the harvesting, plowing, harrowing, and transplanting work, and negotiating reasonable remuneration. The brigade that contracts out the work pays the wages. As a result of adopting this method, the season was seized. The county's rapeseed has been harvested in a timely manner, and the tense rush harvesting of wheat has already begun.

	This newspaper reports that the Beishi, Taihe, and Heishan production brigades of the Dong'e People's Commune in Dongping County, Shandong Province, have promoted the spirit of collaboration and signed a collaboration contract for the summer harvest period in accordance with the principle of "materials and labor, equal value exchange."

	The Beishi Production Brigade is located on the east bank of the Yellow River. Because it suffered from floods last autumn, it is short of more than 40,000 jin of seeds this spring and summer. There are also difficulties in terms of labor and animal power. This year, there are a total of 7,000 mu of wheat fields, with only 140 usable livestock and 1,364 laborers; various agricultural tools are also relatively lacking. Therefore, whether it can complete the summer harvest and planting in a timely manner is a major problem. The Taihe and Heishan production brigades are one in a semi-mountainous area and one in a mountainous area. They have more livestock and less forage; they also plant less wheat. In light of this situation, the commune party committee organized cadres from the three production brigades to negotiate on the issue of mutual support and equal value exchange, and submitted it to the commune members for full discussion. After the two sides reached an agreement, they signed a collaboration contract.

	After the friendship and collaboration contract between the three production brigades was signed, their respective difficulties were resolved, and the enthusiasm of the cadres and commune members for developing production was even greater and their morale was even higher.

    “黄金”遍地　协作抢收
    徐水商庄公社工农商学兵全面配合集中力量迎接夏收夏种
    武冈一些公社和东平东阿公社组织各队等价自愿互相支援
    本报天津24日电　河北徐水县商庄人民公社充分发挥公社的优越性，组织工、农、商、学、兵大协作，突击小麦后期管理和夏收夏种准备工作。
    商庄公社今年共种植冬小麦四千五百五十亩，虽然由于今春雨少天旱，使麦田增产受到一定影响，但由于社员发挥干劲，改变了水利条件，麦子仍然长得比以往那年都好。为了将今年的麦田收好种好，公社党委根据公社化的有利条件，组织工、农、商、学、兵大协作，进行夏收夏种的准备工作。全公社除从后勤部门抽调二千多名劳力、二十多台动力机械支援麦田管理和收种准备工作外，还充分发挥工、农、商、学、兵五位一体的优越性，发动了工业、商业、学校、民兵、医院等各个部门的力量，进行全面大协作，从各个方面支援配合。
    公社的化工厂、机械修配厂、拖拉机站等单位，调出了八台动力机械帮助浇水，还抽出了六十名技术工人，组成修配组，自带工具零件，分片分机器包干检查修理，仅十天时间，即帮助各生产队及时修好了四十五台动力机械、一百五十六辆水车和二百五十多件其他的提水工具。公社各商业单位，也派出采购组，及时调运供应了十九吨汽油、煤炭、肥料。同时还抽出二十四名干部职工，结合供销业务，深入到生产队、组，协助队组干部领导麦田后期管理和夏收夏种的准备工作。公社中小学的一千二百名年岁较大的学生，也利用参加劳动的时间，到田里去帮工。公社医院则组织医疗队，深入田间，边医疗边劳动，支援争取夏季大丰收的斗争。
    目前社队的抢收护麦组织已经建立起来，运麦道路、打麦场和存麦的仓库，正在积极准备。工业部门除继续支援小麦后期管理外，并积极赶制镰刀，保证每个劳力都有一件收割工具。商业部门也积极准备夏收夏种用的苇席子、农药。学校中的收麦队、拾麦队，也正在积极组织。
    本报讯　湖南武冈今年有小麦、油菜等春收作物共九万一千多亩，普遍丰产。为了使丰产果实颗粒还家，并保证及时插上秧，县委采取了组织协作，突击抢收的措施。最紧张阶段，全县有三万二千多人参加抢收油菜，到5月11日止，全县五万四千九百多亩油菜已经全部割下来，冒雨抢运回家，并全部脱粒，未因天雨遭受损失。现在正一鼓作气，乘胜组织小麦的抢收。
    夏收中，有些地区的收、种任务很大，劳力十分紧张，县委便指示他们采取等价交换的办法，协作支援。转弯公社有八千一百多亩油菜，集中在十个大队，任务大、忙不过来，塔岭大队应插二千一百亩中稻，其中油菜田有一千三百四十三亩，占整个中稻田的64％，而全大队仅五百三十人，如靠自己单独干，半个月还完不成任务。为了保证抢收抢插的全面胜利，公社党委召开了大队总支书记会议，特别说明了互相支援协作的重要性，和协作中必须实行等价交换，做到自愿互利。大家都表示拥护。这种协作大体有两种形式：一是以大队为单位，内部组织协作。一般都采取定人、定田、定质量、定领导、定工资的办法，直接包给来支援的队，确定报酬。采取这种办法的有六个大队二十一个生产队，支援人数达一千七百四十人，抢收了油菜一千五百多亩，抢收后又整田一千一百一十亩，并插上了中稻。二是大队与大队之间组织协作，由大队统一承包收割、犁耙和插秧工夫，议定合理报酬。由包出大队付给工资。采取这个办法的结果，抢住了季节。全县的油菜已经及时收完，小麦的紧张抢收又已开始。
    本报讯　山东东平县东阿人民公社北市、太和、黑山三个生产大队，发扬协作精神，按照“物资劳动，等价交换”的原则，签订了夏收期间的协作合同。
    北市生产大队位于黄河东岸，因为去秋遭受水灾，今年春夏两季缺少种子达四万余斤；在劳力和畜力上也有困难，今年共有麦田七千亩，仅有能使役的牲畜一百四十头，劳力一千三百六十四名；各种农具也较缺乏。因此，能不能及时完成夏收夏种，是一个很大的问题。而太和、黑山两个生产大队一个是半山区，一个是山区，他们的牲畜多，饲草少；种的麦子也少。根据这种情况，公社党委组织三个生产大队的干部就相互支援、等价交换问题进行了协商，并交给社员群众进行了充分的讨论，双方取得协议后，签订了协作合同。
    三个生产大队的友谊协作合同签订后，各自的困难都解决了，干部和社员们发展生产的积极性更大，情绪更加高涨。
