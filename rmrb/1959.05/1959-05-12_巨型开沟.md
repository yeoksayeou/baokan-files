    Giant Trenching?
    A ditching plow that can replace the work of 369 laborers in one day was successfully trial-produced at the Beijing Tractor Station Repair Shop on April 7. This giant ditching plow weighs four and a half tons, is 2.9 meters high, and 6.2 meters long. It is suitable for agricultural production to build drainage and irrigation canals.
    After trial use, it was proven that using two C-100 tractors to pull it, it can dig 2.22 kilometers of bucket-shaped canals (0.75 meters deep, 2 meters wide at the top, and 0.22 meters wide at the bottom) per hour. (Li Ling, Song Xiangsheng)
