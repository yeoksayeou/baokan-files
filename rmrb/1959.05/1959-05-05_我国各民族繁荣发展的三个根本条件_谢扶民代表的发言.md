Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I would now like to express some opinions on the brilliant achievements made by ethnic minority areas in the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

The year 1958 was a year in which all fronts in China, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, realized an all-round Great Leap Forward. Like the Han areas of China, minority areas saw a great upsurge of advancing towards nature with the heroic posture of thousands of troops and the overwhelming momentum of overthrowing the old system of oppression and exploitation of the people. Therefore, over the past year or so, the construction achievements of industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings in ethnic minority areas have been very astonishing.

On the agricultural front, thanks to the enthusiastic mass movements of building water conservancy projects, opening up paddy fields, accumulating fertilizers, and reforming technology everywhere, a brand-new situation has emerged in production. According to statistics from the four autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia, the total grain output in 1958 increased from more than 21 billion jin in 1957 to more than 39 billion jin, an increase of 83 percent. In 1958, many ethnic autonomous areas respectively achieved the targets of 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin per mu proposed in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, reversing the long-standing situation of serious grain shortage.

The development of animal husbandry production was also very rapid. In 1957, there were more than 70 million head of livestock in the ethnic minority areas of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu, more than double the number in 1949, while in 1958, the net increase rate of livestock in these four regions reached more than 13 percent, and the livestock in other ethnic minority pastoral areas also increased significantly.

With the strong assistance of the state, and with the Great Leap Forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production, a high tide of running industries by the whole people emerged. The original industrial base in ethnic minority areas was very weak, and some did not even have very simple handicrafts. However, in 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and under the guidance of the policy of simultaneous development of multiple industries, walking on two legs, taking steel as the key link, and making an all-round leap forward, many factories sprang up from the ground almost everywhere. These factories were not only small factories with relatively simple equipment run by the communes, but also many modern large and medium-sized factories. In terms of total industrial output value, the four autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Ningxia alone had more than 2.5 billion yuan in 1958, an increase of 88 percent over 1957 and more than 20 times that of 1949.

Most ethnic minority areas originally had no history of steel production. In the mass steelmaking movement of 1958, these ethnic minority areas, after days and nights of hard work by millions of steelmakers, began to produce thousands of tons of steel.

Thanks to industry, ethnic minority areas were able to manufacture many products that had never been produced in the region's history, providing many more favorable conditions for the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. For example, some ethnic minority areas that originally used "slash-and-burn cultivation" unprecedentedly manufactured many new-style agricultural implements themselves.

The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production promoted the great development of cultural and educational undertakings. According to statistics from the 1957-1958 academic year, there were more than 3.19 million primary school students, more than 310,000 secondary school students, and more than 16,000 university students from ethnic minorities nationwide, with the total number of students in school accounting for about 10 percent of the population. Compared with before liberation, the number of students at all levels increased six-fold for primary school students, 79-fold for secondary school students, and 27-fold for university students. Many ethnic minorities have basically universalized primary school education, and most counties in ethnic minority areas have one or several secondary schools. Autonomous regions and some autonomous prefectures have also established universities and scientific research institutions. Many ethnic minorities who had no written language in the past have now formulated writing schemes and have books and newspapers published in their own languages. In terms of medicine and health, counties and cities in ethnic autonomous areas generally have their own health and medical institutions; the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene has also been widely launched in ethnic minority areas.

On the basis of the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction and the continuous improvement of the people's political and ideological consciousness, a high tide of people's communes has emerged in ethnic minority areas. Within a few months, except for Tibet and some other ethnic minority areas, people's communes have been realized. The widespread establishment and development of people's communes will accelerate socialist construction in ethnic minority areas on a larger scale, thereby further consolidating and developing the unity among all ethnic groups on the basis of socialism. The facts of the rapid development of ethnic minority areas over the past year or so show that the argument that ethnic minorities are "backward" and have "poor conditions" and cannot leap forward is unfounded. Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the broad masses of the Han people, the people of all ethnic minorities in China will surely advance together and jointly build a new socialist China.

The reason why ethnic minority areas in China have been able to advance so rapidly over the past year or so is not accidental. This is entirely due to the fact that since liberation, the Party has led the broad masses of ethnic minority people to complete democratic reforms and basically complete socialist transformation, especially achieving the great victory of the rectification campaign and anti-rightist and socialist education movement centered on opposing local nationalism. A large number of outstanding backbone elements have emerged in this series of revolutionary movements. After the Party's active cultivation, more than 450,000 people have joined the Party organization one after another, and they have played a significant role in past and future work.

After a long period of revolutionary practice, the people of all ethnic minorities have found a common and fundamental path, which is:

1. The Leadership of the Communist Party

The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all revolutionary and construction undertakings. It is the decisive force for the people of all ethnic minorities in China to liberate themselves from dire straits and achieve development and prosperity.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy decided by the Party based on Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues, combined with China's historical development and actual conditions, is completely correct. Up to now, four autonomous regions, one autonomous region preparatory committee, 29 autonomous prefectures, and 54 autonomous counties have been established in ethnic minority areas. The implementation of this policy has not only enabled the people of all ethnic groups in the country to realize their right to develop politics, economy, and culture according to their own characteristics as masters of their own affairs, but also enabled the people of all ethnic groups in the country to jointly build a unified socialist motherland family on the basis of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation.

The Party has also helped ethnic minorities, considering the relatively backward social development of ethnic minorities within the country, to successively transition to socialism and carry out socialist construction from their existing stage of development. Therefore, since liberation, the Party has resolutely led the people of ethnic minorities to carry out democratic reforms and socialist transformation. Now, except for Tibet and some other areas, socialist transformation of the means of production has been completed in all ethnic minority areas, which has fundamentally eliminated the class roots of human exploitation and ethnic oppression. Since 1957, the Party has also led the struggle against bourgeois local nationalism, achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution in politics and ideology in ethnic minority areas.

2. The Unity of the Motherland and the Unity of All Ethnic Groups

Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups in the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause." For a long time, the people of all ethnic groups in China have lived in mixed communities on the vast land of the motherland. Whether in political, economic, or cultural life, they are inseparably linked together in common production struggles and class struggles. Especially in the past hundred years or so, the imperialist aggression against China has made the vast majority of people of all ethnic groups in China deeply feel their common destiny and the preciousness of the unity of the motherland. In the past forty years, thanks to the close unity and common struggle of the people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, they were finally liberated from the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the years after liberation, it is also due to the concerted efforts and hard work of the people of all ethnic groups that China's construction achievements in various fields have been able to achieve brilliant achievements in a short period of time. Therefore, all this fully shows that it is very difficult to achieve national prosperity without the unity of the motherland and the close unity of all ethnic groups. In particular, it is even more impossible to enable ethnic minorities within the country to quickly get rid of poverty and backwardness and develop into socialist nationalities.

3. Taking the Socialist Road

Realizing socialism is the common task of the people of all ethnic groups in China at present, and it is also the only way for all ethnic groups in China to achieve development and prosperity. Therefore, the Constitution of China stipulates that "The People's Republic of China relies on state organs and social forces to gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and establish a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation." This is the fundamental aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in China.

Before liberation, the broad masses of working people of all ethnic minorities in China, in addition to suffering from the aggression of foreign imperialism and the oppression and exploitation of the domestic Kuomintang reactionaries, also suffered from the oppression and exploitation of their own ethnic feudal lords and slave owners, living a miserable and painful life, seriously hindering their development, leaving their economy and culture in a backward state, and their population also declining. After liberation, the system of ethnic oppression within the country was overthrown, but if the old systems in ethnic minorities are not reformed, and if a thorough socialist revolution is not carried out in ethnic minorities, it will be impossible to completely liberate social productive forces, and it will be impossible for them to change their past backward state and achieve complete equality among all ethnic groups. Therefore, social reform within all ethnic groups has become an inevitable and necessary historical task for all ethnic groups to achieve complete liberation.

The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great development of people's communes in ethnic minority areas have once again fully proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, within the unified big family of the motherland, uniting and cooperating, and jointly building socialism, can all ethnic groups develop and prosper. This is the only path to national prosperity. If any ethnic group leaves the leadership of the Party, leaves the big family of the motherland, and leaves the socialist road, it will inevitably fall into poverty and backwardness forever and embark on the road of imperialist colonies. This is the path to national decline, which the people of all ethnic groups in China resolutely oppose.

The Tibetan rebels are traitors to the motherland and common enemies of all ethnic groups. The central government's wise measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion not only safeguarded the interests of the Tibetan people, but also reflected the firm will of the people of all ethnic groups in China to safeguard the unity of the motherland.

The former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and opposing the unity of the motherland, which is resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in China. We resolutely support the State Council's wise measures to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and quell the rebellion. This measure not only safeguards the interests of the broad masses of the Tibetan people, but also reflects the firm will of the people of all ethnic groups in China to safeguard the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups.

Our Party and the Central People's Government have always adhered to the 17-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, upholding the policies of national reunification, ethnic unity, ethnic equality, and gradually implementing ethnic regional autonomy, and gradually implementing democratic reforms, adhering to the policy of freedom of religious belief, and taking various measures to support the economic and cultural development of Tibet. The Central Government, in order to wait for the awakening of the Tibetan upper-level figures, once allowed the reform of the backward social system in Tibet to be slowed down. For a series of treasonous events by the upper-level reactionary clique in Tibet in recent years, the Central Government has repeatedly issued warnings and adopted repeated forbearance. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique have always regarded the Central Government's patient waiting and tolerance as "weak and easy to bully," and continued to collude with imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and foreign reactionaries, attempting to rely on their strength to split the motherland, restore imperialist aggression forces in Tibet, and preserve Tibet's backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system. Finally, they openly tore up the 17-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and frantically launched a full-scale armed rebellion. They burned, killed, looted, raped women, destroyed temples, persecuted patriotic and progressive people, and carried out activities of harming the people and betraying the motherland everywhere. They are traitors to the motherland and common enemies of all ethnic groups. Their heinous crimes seriously violated the interests of the Tibetan people and the interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China. They dared to be enemies with the broad masses of Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in China, and as a result, they embarked on the road to self-destruction.

Tibet is an inseparable part of our great motherland. The rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary elements and the suppression of this rebellion are all internal affairs of our country, and other countries have no right to interfere. However, imperialists and foreign reactionaries are attempting to use this issue to provoke friendly relations between China and Asian and African countries and split the unity of our motherland. These conspiracies of theirs are destined to fail.

Now, we are happy to see that a new page has unfolded in the history of Tibet. Contrary to the wishes of imperialism and Tibetan reactionary forces, the rebellion they launched did not cause the division of the motherland and the regression of Tibet, but played the role of a negative teacher, educating the broad masses of the people, promoting the consolidation of the unity of the motherland, promoting the destruction of the reactionary forces in Tibet, promoting the democratization of Tibet and the rebirth of the Tibetan people. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and with the vigorous assistance of the state and all fraternal ethnic groups, the Tibetan people will surely fundamentally get rid of poverty and backwardness, and together with the people of the whole country, embark on a prosperous and happy socialist society, and will surely transform the Tibetan Plateau from the hell on earth created by the Tibetan reactionary forces into a socialist paradise. Let us warmly congratulate Tibet on starting a new era of democracy and socialism!

### 我国各民族繁荣发展的三个根本条件  谢扶民代表的发言

    我国各民族繁荣发展的三个根本条件
    谢扶民代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长向大会所做的报告。我现在就一九五八年民族地区在大跃进当中取得的辉煌成就，发表些意见。
    一九五八年是我国各个战线上在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，实现全面大跃进的一年。我国各少数民族地区和汉族地区一样，出现了以千军万马的雄姿和排山倒海的声势，向大自然进军，向旧的压迫剥削人民的制度宣战的伟大热潮。所以，一年多来，少数民族地区的工农业生产和文化教育事业的建设成就是非常惊人的。
    在农业战线上，由于到处掀起的热火朝天的修水利、开水田、积肥料、改革技术等群众性运动，使生产上出现了崭新的局面。根据内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏四个自治区的统计，一九五八年的粮食总产量已由一九五七年的二百一十多亿斤增加到三百九十多亿斤，增长了百分之八十三。很多民族自治地方一九五八年的粮食平均亩产已经分别提前实现了农业发展纲要提出的四百斤、五百斤、八百斤的指标，扭转了历来严重缺粮的局面。
    在畜牧业生产上的发展也是很快的，一九五七年内蒙古、新疆、青海、甘肃等少数民族地区即有牲畜七千多万头，比一九四九年增加一倍以上，而一九五八年这四个地区的牲畜纯增率又达到百分之十三以上，其他少数民族牧业区的牲畜，也都有了显著的增加。
    在国家大力帮助下，随着农牧业生产大跃进，出现了全民办工业的高潮。少数民族地区原来的工业基础是很薄弱的，有些连很简单的手工业也没有。但是，一九五八年在党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的光辉照耀下，在几个并举，两条腿走路，以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针指引下，几乎到处从平地竖起了许多工厂。这些工厂不仅仅是社办的设备比较简单的小厂，其中有不少的近代化的大中型工厂。就工业总产值来看，一九五八年仅以内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏四个自治区统计就有二十五亿多元，比一九五七年增长百分之八十八，比一九四九年增长了二十倍以上。
    大部分少数民族地区原来根本没有生产钢铁的历史，在一九五八年的全民炼钢炼铁运动中，这些少数民族地区经过了几百万钢铁大军的日夜苦战，开始生产了成千上万吨的钢铁。
    由于有了工业，各少数民族地区能够制造出了本地区历史上从来没有生产过的许多产品，给农牧业生产提供了许多更为有利的发展条件。如某些原来采用“刀耕火种”的民族地区，破天荒的自己制造了许多新式农具。
    工农业生产的大跃进，促进了文化教育事业的大发展。根据一九五七年至一九五八年学年度的统计，全国已有少数民族小学生三百一十九万多人，中等学校学生三十一万多人，高等学校学生一万六千余人，总计在学的学生人数约占人口的百分之十左右。各级学生人数和解放前比较，小学生增加了六倍，中学生增加了七十九倍，大学生增加了二十七倍。有许多少数民族，已经基本上普及了小学教育，绝大部分少数民族地区的县，都有了一所或几所中等学校，各自治区和一些自治州还建立了高等学校和科学研究机构。有许多过去没有文字的少数民族，现在已经制定了文字方案，有了用自己的文字出版的书籍和报纸。在医药卫生方面，各民族自治地方的县市，一般都有了自己的卫生医疗机构；除四害、讲卫生的运动也已经在少数民族地区普遍展开。
    在社会主义建设全面大跃进和人民政治思想觉悟不断提高的基础上，各民族地区又出现了人民公社化运动的高潮。在几个月的时间内，除了西藏和某些其他少数民族地区外，都已经实现了人民公社化。在人民公社化的高潮中，使某些少数民族地区越过了几个历史发展阶段，跳跃式的投入了社会主义的洪流。人民公社的普遍建立和发展，将在更大规模上加速少数民族地区的社会主义建设，从而各民族之间的团结在社会主义的基础上将获得进一步的巩固和发展。经过一年多来少数民族地区飞跃发展的事实说明，所谓少数民族“落后”和“条件差”不可能跃进的论调是没有根据的。我国的少数民族人民在党的领导和汉族广大人民的支援下，各少数民族一定能一道前进，共同建设社会主义的新中国。
    一年多来，我国各少数民族地区之所以能够如此飞跃前进，并不是偶然的，这完全是由于解放以来，党领导了广大的少数民族人民，先后完成了民主改革和基本上完成了社会主义改造，特别是取得了以反对地方民族主义为中心的整风、反右和社会主义教育运动的伟大胜利的结果。在这一系列的革命运动中涌现了大批的优秀骨干分子，经过党的积极培养已有四十五万多人，先后参加了党的组织，他们在过去和今后的工作中都起着很大作用。
    少数民族人民经过长期的革命实践，找到了一条共同的基本的道路，这就是：
    一、共产党的领导
    党的领导是一切革命事业和建设事业能够获得胜利的根本保证，是我国各少数民族人民从水深火热中解放出来，并获得发展繁荣的决定力量。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，党根据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论，结合我国的历史发展和实际情况，所决定的民族区域自治政策是完全正确的。到目前为止，先后在少数民族地区建立了四个自治区、一个自治区筹备委员会、二十九个自治州、五十四个自治县。这一政策的贯彻执行，不但使国内各民族人民实现了按照自己的特点，来发展政治、经济和文化的当家作主的权利，同时，使国内各民族人民在平等团结、互助合作的基础上，共同建设统一的社会主义祖国大家庭。
    党还根据了国内各少数民族的社会发展比较落后的情况，帮助他们从现有的发展阶段上，都先后过渡到社会主义和进行社会主义建设。所以，解放以来，党坚决领导了少数民族人民，进行了民主改革和社会主义改造。现在除了西藏和其他一些地区外，各少数民族地区都已经完成了生产资料的社会主义改造，这就根本上消除了人剥削人和民族压迫的阶级根源。一九五七年以来，党又领导进行了反对资产阶级地方民族主义的斗争，取得了少数民族地区政治上、思想上社会主义革命的伟大胜利。
    二、祖国的统一和各民族的团结
    毛主席说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”我国各民族人民长时期以来，是交错杂居在祖国广大的土地上，无论政治、经济、文化生活，都是在共同的生产斗争和阶级斗争中，不可分离地紧密联系在一起。特别是近一百多年来，帝国主义对我国的侵略，使我国各民族的最大多数人深切感到他们的共同命运，感到祖国的统一的可贵。近四十年来，由于各民族人民在中国共产党的领导下的亲密团结，共同斗争，最后才从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治下解放出来。解放后数年来，也是由于各民族人民的一致努力和辛勤劳动，我国各方面的建设成就才能在短短的时间内获得了辉煌的成就。所以，这一切充分说明了离开祖国的统一和各民族的亲密团结，国家的繁荣是很困难的。尤其是要使国内各少数民族迅速摆脱穷困落后的状态，发展成为社会主义民族，更是不可能的。
    三、走社会主义道路
    实现社会主义是我国各民族人民目前共同奋斗的任务，也是我国各民族获得发展繁荣的必经途径。所以，我国宪法规定“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”这是我国各民族人民的根本愿望。
    解放以前，我国各少数民族的广大劳动人民，除了遭受外国帝国主义的侵略和国内国民党反动派的压迫剥削以外，还饱受着本民族封建主、奴隶主阶级的压迫与剥削，过着悲惨的痛苦生活，严重地阻碍着他们的发展，使他们的经济、文化处于落后状态，人口也在下降。解放后，国内的民族压迫制度是被推翻了，但是，如果不改革少数民族中的那些旧制度，不在少数民族中进行彻底的社会主义革命，就不可能彻底的解放社会生产力，也就无法使他们改变过去落后的面貌，达到各民族完全平等的地步。所以，各民族内部的社会改革，便成为各民族获得彻底解放的不可避免也是必须完成的历史任务。
    少数民族地区工农业生产大跃进和人民公社的大发展，又一次充分证明：我国各民族只有在中国共产党的领导下，在统一的祖国大家庭内，团结合作，共同建设社会主义，才能使自己的民族得到发展和繁荣。这是民族繁荣的唯一的道路。任何一个民族，如果离开了党的领导，离开了祖国大家庭，离开了社会主义道路，就必然永远陷入贫困和落后状态，走上帝国主义殖民地的道路。这是民族衰亡的道路，是我国各民族人民所坚决反对的。
    西藏叛乱分子是祖国的叛徒，是各族人民的共同敌人。中央平定西藏叛乱的英明措施，不但维护了西藏人民的利益，而且反映了我国各族人民维护祖国统一的坚强意志
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，发动了背叛祖国、反对祖国统一的武装叛乱，这是我国各民族人民坚决反对的。我们坚决拥护国务院解散原西藏地方政府和平息叛乱的英明措施。这一措施不但维护了西藏广大人民的利益，而且反映了我国各民族人民维护祖国统一和各民族团结的坚强意志。
    我们的党和中央人民政府一贯按照和平解放西藏的十七条协议，坚持祖国统一、民族团结、民族平等和逐步实行民族区域自治，逐步实行民主改革的政策，坚持宗教信仰自由政策，并且采取各种措施，扶助西藏地方的经济和文化的发展。中央为了等待西藏上层分子的觉悟，曾经允许西藏落后的社会制度的改革，可以放慢一些。对于西藏上层反动集团几年来一连串的叛国事件，中央一再提出警告，并且采取再三忍让的态度。但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团一贯把中央的耐心等待和宽大为怀当作“软弱可欺”，继续勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派，企图依靠他们的力量来分裂祖国，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，保存西藏的落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度。最后公然撕毁和平解放西藏的十七条协议，疯狂地发动了全面的武装叛乱。他们到处烧杀抢劫，奸淫妇女，破坏寺庙，迫害爱国进步人士，进行残害人民、背叛祖国的活动。他们是祖国的叛徒，是各民族人民的共同敌人。他们的滔天罪行严重地违反了西藏人民的利益和我国各民族人民的利益。他们竟敢与广大藏族人民和我国各民族人民为敌，结果走上了自取灭亡的道路。
    西藏是我们伟大祖国不可分割的一部分。西藏反动分子的叛乱和这一叛乱的平息，都是我们国家的内政，其他国家无权加以干涉。但是，帝国主义者和外国反动派企图借此问题，来挑拨我国和亚非国家的友好关系，分裂我们祖国的统一。他们这些阴谋诡计，注定是要失败的。
    现在，我们高兴地看到，西藏的历史展开了新的一页。同帝国主义和西藏反动势力的愿望相反，他们发动的叛乱，不是造成了祖国的分裂和西藏的倒退，而是起了反面教员的作用，教育了广大人民，促进了祖国统一的巩固，促进了西藏反动势力的灭亡，促进了西藏的民主化和西藏人民的新生。我们相信，西藏人民在党的领导下，在国家和各兄弟民族的大力帮助下，一定能够从根本上摆脱贫困落后的状态，和全国人民一道，共同走上繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，一定能够把西藏高原从西藏反动势力所造成的人间地狱，变成一个社会主义的天堂。让我们热烈祝贺西藏开始了民主和社会主义的新时期！
