Release Glezos!
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    Today, May 31st, marks the eighteenth anniversary of the day the Greek national hero Manolis Glezos tore down the Nazi swastika flag from the Acropolis of Athens. Eighteen years ago, when fascist Germany trampled on the freedom of Greece and raised the fascist swastika flag on the Acropolis of Athens, Glezos bravely climbed the Acropolis, tore it down, and raised the Greek flag. This heroic action by Glezos opened the prelude to the "Greek Resistance Movement" and inspired the Greek people's struggle against the German occupiers. But today, this Greek national hero, member of the administrative committee of the Greek United Democratic Left Party, and president of the "Dawn Daily" newspaper, Glezos, is unreasonably arrested and persecuted by the Greek reactionary authorities on trumped-up charges.
    Glezos is a loyal son of the Greek people, a fearless patriot. From the time of the Nazi German occupation of Greece, the British occupation of Greece after World War II, until the period of reactionary Greek rule, Glezos consistently and tirelessly waged an unyielding struggle for the national independence of Greece. In these struggles, Glezos was arrested and imprisoned several times and sentenced to death three times. But none of this could destroy his strong will to fight for Greek independence and freedom. When the reactionaries had to release him from prison under popular protest, Glezos immediately plunged into new battles. Glezos's actions have won the admiration and love of the Greek people. Even after Glezos was imprisoned by the reactionaries, the Greek working people elected him twice as a member of parliament.
    When the Greek reactionary authorities arrested Glezos on December 5 last year, they even trumped up charges of "espionage activities" and "plotting a coup d'état." However, even former Greek Prime Minister Tsouderos pointed out: "Not a word in the accusations against Glezos is true." In fact, the Greek reactionary government's shameless persecution of Glezos precisely exposed its face of suppressing democratic and progressive forces. In recent years, the Greek government has followed the United States and implemented policies that violate national interests, placing Greece's politics, economy, and territory under the servitude and control of U.S. imperialism. Last year, the Karamanlis government's agreement to allow the United States to establish U.S. missile bases on Greek territory pushed Greece into a dangerous abyss. The Greek people certainly cannot tolerate Karamanlis's act of betraying national interests. The Greek people's movement to strive for peace and democratic independence is developing, and progressive forces are growing stronger. In the general election last May, the ruling National Radical Union suffered a serious setback, while the United Democratic Left Party to which Glezos belonged, because it has consistently stood at the forefront of the struggle to defend Greek national independence and democratic freedom, won 24% of the votes, and its seats in parliament increased from eighteen in 1956 to seventy-eight, becoming the largest opposition party in the country. All this cannot but make the United States and the Greek reactionary government extremely worried. Therefore, they launched a frantic counterattack against the Greek patriotic and democratic forces, attempting to clear the way for the continued implementation of anti-national interest Cold War policies.
    The Greek reactionary government's persecution of democratic forces immediately aroused the indignation and condemnation of the broad strata of the Greek people and many prominent social figures. The Greek people's protest against the Greek government's persecution of patriots is in full swing. People realize that saving Glezos is saving Greek democracy, freedom, and peace. Currently, an international movement to rescue Glezos is unfolding. All peace-loving and righteous people and organizations have lodged protests with the Greek government, demanding the release of Glezos. The All-China Journalists Association and the Chinese Writers Association both issued protest letters in January this year, expressing their support for Glezos.
    Due to the pressure of public opinion at home and abroad, the Greek reactionary authorities had to announce a delay in the trial of Glezos. However, the Greek military court is still preparing to murder him. All righteous people in the world are calling out: No murder of Glezos is allowed! Glezos's freedom must be restored!

    释放格列索斯！
    本报评论员
    今年5月31日是希腊民族英雄马诺里斯·格列索斯从雅典城堡上撕下德国法西斯卐字旗的十八周年。十八年前当法西斯德国践踏了希腊的自由，在雅典的城堡上升起法西斯卐字旗的时候，格列索斯奋不顾身地登上城堡，把它撕下，升起了希腊的旗帜。格列索斯这一英勇行动，揭开了“希腊抵抗运动”的序幕，鼓舞了希腊人民反对德国占领者的斗争。但是今天，这位希腊的民族英雄、希腊统一民主左翼党行政委员会委员和“黎明日报”社社长格列索斯却被希腊反动当局以莫须有的罪名无理逮捕，横遭迫害。
    格列索斯是希腊人民的忠诚儿子、无畏的爱国者。自德国纳粹占领希腊、第二次大战后英国占领希腊直至希腊反动统治的期间，格列索斯始终坚持不懈地为争取希腊的民族独立进行不屈不挠的斗争。在这些斗争中，格列索斯曾经几次被捕入狱，并且三次被判死刑。但是这一切都没有能摧毁他争取希腊独立和自由的坚强意志。当反动派在人民抗议下不得不把他释放出狱之后，格列索斯又立即投入新的战斗。格列索斯的行动，赢得了希腊人民的敬仰和热爱。甚至在格列索斯被反动派关进监狱后，希腊劳动人民还曾两次把他选为国会议员。
    去年12月5日，希腊反动当局逮捕格列索斯时，竟横加以什么“间谍活动”、“策动政变”等等罪名。然而，连希腊前首相曹达利斯也指出：“在对格列索斯的控告中没有一个字是真话”。实际上，希腊反动政府对格列索斯的无耻迫害，恰恰暴露了它镇压民主进步力量的面目。几年来，希腊政府追随美国、执行违反民族利益的政策，使希腊的政治、经济和国土都置于美帝国主义的奴役和控制之下。去年卡拉曼利斯政府同意美国在希腊领土上建立美国火箭基地，更把希腊推向一个危险的深渊。希腊人民当然不能容忍卡拉曼利斯这种出卖民族利益的行为。希腊人民争取和平和民主独立的运动日益发展，进步力量日益壮大。在去年5月的大选中，执政的国民激进联盟遭到了严重的挫折，而格列索斯所属的统一民主左翼党，由于它一贯站在捍卫希腊民族独立、民主自由的斗争前列，获得了24％的选票，在议会中的议席从1956年的十八席增加到七十八席，成为国内最大的反对党。这一切不能不使美国和希腊反动政府极为担忧。因此，它们就对希腊爱国民主力量进行疯狂的反扑，企图为继续推行反民族利益的冷战政策廓清道路。
    希腊反动政府迫害民主力量的行为，立即引起了希腊广大阶层人民和许多著名社会人士的愤慨和谴责。希腊人民的抗议希腊政府迫害爱国者的行动正在方兴未艾。人们认识到拯救格列索斯就是拯救希腊的民主、自由和和平。目前，在国际上，一个营救格列索斯的运动正在展开。一切爱好和平和正义的人士和组织纷纷向希腊政府提出了抗议，要求释放格列索斯。中华全国新闻工作者协会和作家协会今年1月都曾发表了抗议书，声援格列索斯。
    由于国内外舆论的压力，希腊反动当局曾经不得不宣布延迟对格列索斯的审判。但是，希腊军事法庭还准备杀害他。全世界正义人类大声呼吁：不准杀害格列索斯！必须恢复格列索斯的自由！（附图片）
