    Weaving without a Warp Beam
    The Wuhan Canvas Factory has successfully experimented with weaving cloth directly from yarn cones – weaving without a warp beam. This eliminates the warping process and saves labor.
    
    A loom without a warp beam can allow the cloth machine to fully utilize its mechanical efficiency, increase production, and save cotton yarn. The factory estimates that, after promotion, it can save nine pieces of cotton yarn and increase production by 30,000 meters within half a year.

    织布不用经轴
    武汉帆布厂直接用筒纱织布试验成功——织布不用经轴。它免去了整经工序的操作过程，节省了劳动力。
    织机不用经轴，可使布机充分发挥机械效率，提高生产，并节约棉纱。这个厂预计推广后，在半年内即可节约棉纱九件，增加产量三万公尺。
