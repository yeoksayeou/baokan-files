Comrade Lü Jifang speaks on the achievements of the Hefei University of Technology in the past year.

Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I completely agree with and endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report from the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, and I will resolutely implement them.

For several years, the Chinese Communist Party has consistently implemented the policy of unity, education, and transformation towards members of democratic parties and bourgeois intellectuals, helping us to reform ourselves; constantly arming us with Marxism-Leninism so that we can understand the laws of development of objective things, and thereby master and apply them; especially in the context of last year's Great Leap Forward, repeatedly teaching us to liberate our minds and break down superstitions, thus enabling us to make progress to varying degrees in politics and ideology, allowing us to contribute to socialist construction during last year's Great Leap Forward.

Now, please allow me to use the example of Hefei University of Technology to illustrate some of my personal thoughts and experiences.

A year ago, just as the spring breeze was spreading widely and all flowers were blooming, all the faculty, staff, and students of our Hefei University of Technology, like the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, launched a vigorous heart-to-heart movement, determined to hand their hearts over to the Party and their knowledge to the people, striving for both redness and expertise. The primary requirement of the heart-to-heart movement was to resolutely accept the leadership of the Party and firmly follow the socialist road, that is, to fight a decisive battle on the political and ideological fronts.

Under the shining light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, driven by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, and with the implementation of the Party's education policy, we intellectuals received a series of ideological reform educations, and the ideological outlook of the majority of people changed to varying degrees, thereby boosting their enthusiasm and promoting the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. In just six months, three Great Leap Forward upsurges were launched. First, the work-study program was conscientiously implemented; second, factories were established on a large scale, a technological revolution was vigorously promoted, and creations and inventions were vigorously pursued; third, an education revolution was vigorously promoted, production labor was vigorously engaged in, and the school was transformed into a factory, and the mine site was transformed into a classroom.

In terms of vigorously promoting the technological revolution, from July of last year to New Year's Day of this year, a total of 2,107 scientific research, invention, creation, and new product trial projects were completed, among which the more significant ones were oxygen-blown steelmaking and a 1,050-kilowatt motor. Oxygen-blown steelmaking was specifically suited to small and medium-sized steelmaking, combined with the needs of national steel development at that time. Although this method was theoretically understood in the past, there was great creativity in how to turn theory into practice. At that time, a teacher failed several times in his experiments. Later, a second-year student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, encouraged by the Party, boldly experimented and succeeded. The 1,050-kilowatt motor was successfully trial-produced by second-year students from the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering with the help of teachers. Under the strong leadership and support of the Party, they worked hard for fourteen days and nights, overcame various difficulties, and finally made such a large generator. At that time, some people opposed it, thinking that this leap forward was too fast, saying that "a leap of three or five steps is possible, but a leap of thirty or fifty steps is not possible." Facts have proved that this view is completely wrong.

Since June of last year, Hefei University of Technology has conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy, vigorously promoted the education revolution, and implemented measures that combined teaching as the center, teaching research, and production labor, and the results have been extremely significant. In the past, school education had the phenomenon of "three separations": separation from politics, separation from reality, and separation from production labor. At present, the face of school education has begun to undergo fundamental changes. At the same time, since the in-depth implementation of the Party's instructions on education work, the school has strengthened the theoretical teaching work of basic courses and technical basic courses, and through on-site teaching and combining with production labor in the major, the teaching work of the major courses has also been greatly strengthened. After repeated discussions and summaries throughout the school, it is generally reflected that the achievements in implementing the Party's education policy are enormous, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved. Many old teachers and students have their personal experiences. These achievements are mainly reflected in the following seven aspects:

First, there is a further understanding of the Party's education policy. In the past six months, the Department of Mining Engineering alone had more than 800 students from the second, third, and fourth grades, and more than 40 teachers who went to the Huainan, Huaibei, and Kailuan coal mines and well-building sites for on-site teaching and scientific research. At that time, some teachers and students had a lack of understanding of the Party's education policy, and held skeptical attitudes, and even a few people had resistance. However, after more than half a year of production labor, they have begun to realize that the Party's education policy is completely correct, and the gains are great. For example, one old teacher had always emphasized the need to write lecture notes and was unwilling to go to the site. Later, he went to the site after being mobilized by the Party branch. After two months of on-site teaching, he saw that participating in production labor had many advantages. After returning to school, he summarized his six experiences (mainly the achievements and advantages of on-site teaching), four personal gains, and twelve suggestions for future on-site teaching in a symposium. He said: "At the beginning of the three combinations, there was still resistance, but after more than 50 days of on-site teaching, through production labor, through practice, our ideological understanding has undergone further changes. I personally experienced that:

(1) In the past, learning from the site was to increase personal knowledge, but this time it is mainly for teaching, so the learning is deeper and the gains are richer than before.
(2) After listening to several reports from workers and technicians on site, and participating in technical meetings, and discussing technical issues with them many times, I have a deeper understanding of the existing problems and development directions on the site, and my personal business has also improved.
(3) Teaching on-site, students have high requirements for teachers, requiring theory to be linked to practice, and they are dissatisfied with dogmatic and formalistic teaching; but they are very willing to learn practical and useful knowledge, and teaching is very easy and fast, and the effect is very good.
(4) Students study quite deeply, and they require a thorough understanding of problems, no matter how small. For example, one student raised more than 100 questions by himself when reviewing hydraulic coal mining at the end; another student, who had mostly failed his coursework in school and had never asked the teacher questions, was very active in his studies during on-site teaching and often discussed with us, and the result was a good exam score.
(5) On-site teaching is based on practical things, and these things are constantly changing, so students analyze problems very concretely and deeply, and their ability to distinguish between right and wrong is also very keen. Students can easily identify whether the teacher's explanation is correct or not, and whether it is good or not.
(6) As a result of on-site teaching, students not only learn a lot of practical and useful knowledge, but also study theory better than in school, which can be proved by the general improvement of exam scores (for example, students in the Huainan Coal Mine, when taking the exam, for a question – "What problems do you think exist in the first hydraulic mining area of ×× mine? How to solve it? – not only put forward the nine major problems existing in this hydraulic coal mining area, but also explained in detail the causes of these problems and the solutions, which have both practical content and theoretical analysis"). Therefore, it is certain that the quality of teaching has been greatly improved.

Second, it is deeply realized that only the Party can lead teaching. In the early days of the implementation of the new education policy, it was opposed by a few teachers and students, and when encountering some difficulties in implementing the three-combination measures, those who did not have a clear understanding of the Party's education policy asked to retreat. Facts have proved that only under the leadership of the Party and the insistence of the masses can it be conscientiously implemented. When we have difficulties, the Party helps us solve them in a timely manner; when we have slack emotions, the Party promotes us forward; when we have pride and complacency, the Party timely rings the alarm bell for us; and when we make some progress, the Party gives us enthusiastic encouragement. The Party has fully utilized the mass line and brought into play the power of the masses, both in the Great Leap Forward and in the implementation of the education policy. One teacher said: "In the past, I thought that teaching was a matter for teachers, and theoretical knowledge could only be mastered by a few people; for the Party's mass line, I thought that some work needed to follow the mass line, but education and scientific research could not follow the mass line. The Great Leap Forward made me realize the truth of the mass line, which is not an exception for teaching and scientific research. Therefore, there has been a basic change in my thinking."

Third, the broad masses of teachers and students have undergone labor training and have initially established correct labor views. When teachers and students first arrived at the mine, many people were not used to it, and many people showed fear of fatigue, hardship, and dirt, and were unwilling to work. Some people with serious bourgeois ideas openly opposed labor. However, after a period of training, the concept of despising labor training has begun to change. Some people have even written poems praising labor, such as "Heroes on the coal face, everyone's enthusiasm is better than Wu Song's, black gold rushes down, people are redder than molten steel."

Fourth, they have received a profound class education and have established deep class feelings with the workers. Once, when a student was working underground, a stone fell down, and the student was saved from danger under the enthusiastic care and help of the master worker. In this way, teachers and students were deeply educated by the high communist moral qualities of the workers. The selfless labor of the workers is also constantly educating teachers and students, and they are increasingly generating respect and love for the workers, thus establishing deep feelings with the workers.

Fifth, scientific research work has been widely promoted. In the past, scientific research work was only a matter for a few teachers, and only a very few senior students could participate. Since the implementation of the three combinations, not only has a large team been established among teachers in scientific research, but also many people have participated among students, almost from the first grade. In particular, students encounter a series of problems in production labor that must be solved, which will inevitably promote scientific research work. For example, in the Huainan Coal Mine Brigade and the Huaibei Well-Building Brigade, a total of 572 scientific research and technological innovation projects were completed last "October 1st" and this year's "New Year's Day." Now, the situation of scientific research in our school is "three mores": that is, more people participate; more projects are completed; and more benefits are brought to production.

Sixth, the students' organizational skills and skills in leading production have been cultivated.

Seventh, the physical fitness of teachers and students has been enhanced. In particular, the number of people suffering from neurasthenia has been greatly reduced. For example, among the 224 people who participated in production labor in the Huaibei Coal Mine, 198 people gained weight; 62 people suffered from neurasthenia when they first arrived, but only 7 people remained when they returned to school.

In a word: the advantages are endless. However, the Party's education policy, for us bourgeois intellectuals, because of the influence of bourgeois education in the old society, the separation of theory from practice, and the neglect of labor practice, has been deeply imprinted in our minds, and its advantages are not easily appreciated all at once. Now the facts have shown its unparalleled superiority, it is the correct path for the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of workers and peasants, we must resolutely implement it in the future, and there should be no slightest hesitation or doubt.

The Party has repeatedly taught us that the purpose of socialist education is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and to establish a strong contingent of working-class intellectuals to serve the construction of socialism and the realization of communism. To achieve this goal, we need a huge contingent of teachers who have socialist and communist ideas and can dedicate themselves to the cause of education for the working class, who are both red and expert. Only by being both red and expert can we have a firm working-class political direction, serve the politics of the working class wholeheartedly, and contribute our strength to the cause of socialist education with utmost loyalty.

For more than a year, after the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward and the movement of the education revolution, although I have received a series of communist educations, which has greatly improved my ideological understanding, as a socialist educator, it is far from enough, and it is still unable to meet the needs of the socialist education cause. For this reason, I must continue to strengthen self-reform. I should strive to be both red and expert, and under the leadership of the Party, continue to implement the Party's education policy better, and fight to the end for the socialist education cause of the motherland.

    从事实看党的教育方针的胜利
    吕季方委员谈合肥工业大学一年来的成绩主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席的政协第二届全国委员会常委会的工作报告，并要坚决贯彻执行。
    几年来，中国共产党对于民主党派成员、资产阶级知识分子，一贯执行了团结、教育、改造的政策，帮助我们进行自我改造；不断地以马克思列宁主义武装我们，要我们能够认识客观事物的发展规律，并从而掌握它、运用它；尤其是在去年大跃进的形势下，一再教导我们要解放思想，破除迷信，因而使我们在政治上、思想上都有不同程度的进步，使我们在去年的大跃进当中，才能为社会主义建设而贡献力量。
    现在，请允许我以合肥工业大学的事例，来说明个人的一些感想和体会。
    一年前，正当春风广被、百花竞芳的时候，我们合肥工业大学的全体师生员工，和全国人民一样，在党的领导下，在反右派斗争胜利的基础上，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的向党交心运动，大家决心要把心交给党，把知识交给人民，奔向红与专。交心运动的首要要求，就是要坚决接受党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路，也就是说要在政治战线和思想战线上打一个决定性的胜仗。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在全国大跃进形势的推动下，以及在党的教育方针的贯彻执行下，使我们知识分子接连地受到了一系列的思想改造的教育，多数人的思想面貌有了不同程度的改变，从而鼓起了干劲，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。在短短的半年内，就掀起了三次大跃进的高潮。首先，认真实行了勤工俭学；第二，大办工厂，大闹技术革命，大搞创造发明；第三，大闹教育革命，大搞生产劳动，实行学校办工厂和变矿山现场为课堂。
    在大闹技术革命方面，从去年七月到今年元旦共完成科学研究、发明创造和试制新产品等项目达二千一百零七项之多，其中比较重大的有吹氧炼钢和一千零五十瓩的电动机。吹氧炼钢是结合当时全国钢铁发展的需要，特别适合中小型炼钢。这种方法过去在理论上虽然懂得，但如何使理论变成实际，这就有很大的创造性。当时有位教师经过几次试验都失败了，后来由一位机制系的二年级学生，在党的鼓舞下，大胆地试验成功了。一千零五十瓩的电动机是在教师的帮助下，由机电系二年级同学们试制成功的。他们在党的坚强领导和支持下，苦战十四昼夜，克服了种种困难，终于制成了这样大的发电机。当时曾经有人反对过，认为这样跃进未免太快了，说什么“一步跃三五步则可以，一步跃三五十步则不可以”，事实证明了这种看法是完全错误的。
    合肥工业大学从去年六月开始，认真贯彻执行了党的教育方针，大闹教育革命，实行了以教学为中心，教学研究和生产劳动相结合的措施，成绩也是极其显著的。以往学校教育存在“三脱离”现象：脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离生产劳动。目前学校教育面貌已开始有了根本的改变。同时，从深入贯彻党的教育工作指示以来，学校加强了基础课和技术基础课的理论教学工作，通过现场教学和结合专业搞生产劳动，专业课的教学工作也大大加强了。经过全校性多次反复的讨论和总结，普遍反映贯彻党的教育方针成绩是巨大的，教学质量有了显著的提高，很多的老教师和同学们都有他们的亲身体会。这些成绩主要表现在下列七个方面：
    第一、对党的教育方针有了进一步的认识。半年来，参加生产劳动的仅采矿工程系一个系就有二、三、四年级学生八百余人，教师四十余人分别到淮南、淮北及开滦等煤矿及建井工地进行现场教学和科学研究。当时也曾有一部分师生对党的教育方针认识不清，曾抱着怀疑态度，甚至有少数人还有抵触情绪。但是经过半年多的生产劳动之后，他们已开始认识到党的教育方针是完全正确的，收获是很大的。如有一位老教师，他开始一直是强调要编写讲义，不愿到现场去，后来在党总支的动员下才去现场。在通过两个月的现场教学后，看到了参加生产劳动确有很多优点，回校后，在一次座谈会上他总结性的提出了他参加现场教学后的六点体会（主要是现场教学的成绩和优点），四点个人收获和十二点对今后现场教学的意见。他说：“三结合开始时，尚有抵触情绪，但是通过了五十多天的现场教学，通过生产劳动，通过实践，对我们的思想认识有了进一步的转变。我亲身体会到：
    （一）过去向现场学习是为了增加个人知识，这次主要是为教学，因此学习比以前深透，收获更为丰富。
      （二）在现场听过工人和技术员的几次报告，参加过技术会议，也和他们多次讨论技术问题，对于现场存在的问题和发展方向，得到比较深刻的认识，个人业务上也有所提高。
      （三）现场进行教学，同学对教师要求很高，要求理论联系实际，他们对教条主义和形式主义的教学都很不满；但对实际有用的知识却极愿学习，能够联系讲解的问题，教学很容易而且很快，效果很好。
      （四）同学们学习相当深入，问题不论大小都要求彻底明了。例如有一个同学在最后复习水力采煤时，一个人就提出了一百多个问题；还有一个同学，在学校学习时，功课多数不及格，从来也不曾向老师提问题，可是在现场教学中，他学习很积极，经常和我们讨论，结果考试成绩很好。
      （五）现场教学因有实际东西作基础，而这些东西是在不断变化的，因此同学们分析问题很具体，很深入，辨别是非也很敏锐，教师讲的对不对，好不好，同学们很容易识别。
      （六）现场教学的结果，同学们不但学到了许多实际有用的知识，而且理论学习也比在校学习得好，这可以从考试成绩一般都提高而得到证明（例如在淮南煤矿的同学，在考试时对于一个考题——“你认为××矿第一水采区存在那些问题？如何解决？——不仅提出了这个水力采煤区存在的九大问题，而且详尽的说明产生这些问题的原因和解决办法，既有实际内容，又有理论分析”）。因此，肯定地说，教学质量是大大提高了。
    第二、深深地认识到只有党才能领导教学。在新的教育方针执行的初期，曾经遭到少数教师和学生的反对，及至在贯彻三结合措施稍遇到一些困难时，那些对党的教育方针认识不清的人就要求打退堂鼓。事实证明只有在党的领导和群众的坚持下，才能认真地贯彻
  下去。当我们有困难时，党及时帮助我们解决；
  当我们有松懈情绪时，党又推动着我们前进；当我们有骄傲自满情绪时，党及时向我们敲起警钟；而当我们有点进步的时候，党又给我们以热情的鼓舞。党不论是在大跃进当中以及在贯彻执行教育方针时都充分运用了群众路线，发挥了群众的力量。有一个教师说：“过去我认为搞教学是教师的事，理论知识只能是少数人掌握的；对于党的群众路线，认为有些工作需要走群众路线，但对教育、科学研究则认为是不能走群众路线的。通过大跃进，使我认识了群众路线这个真理，它对教学和科学研究也不是例外的。因此，在自己的思想上有了一个基本的转变。”
    第三、广大师生经受了劳动锻炼，初步树立了正确的劳动观点。教师和同学们初到矿山时，很多人不习惯，不少的人表现怕累、怕苦、怕脏，不愿劳动。还有些资产阶级思想严重的人则公开反对劳动。但是经过一段时间锻炼之后，轻视劳动锻炼的观念，已开始有所改变了。有的人还写出赞美劳动的诗歌，如“采煤面上比英雄，干劲个个赛武松，黑金哗哗往下流，人比钢水还要红”。
    第四、受到了深刻的阶级教育，与工人同志建立了深厚的阶级感情。有一次，一个同学在井下工作时，一块石头掉下来了，在老师傅的热情照顾与帮助下，而使这个同学免于危险。师生们就这样地深深地受到了工人同志们的高度共产主义道德品质的教育。工人们的忘我劳动也时刻在教育着教师和同学，在他们当中日益产生着对工人同志们的尊敬和热爱，因而与工人同志们建立了深厚的感情。
    第五、广泛地推动了科学研究工作。在以往，科学研究工作仅仅是少数教师的事，而同学们能够参加的也仅仅是高年级的极少数的学生。自实行三结合以后，科学研究不但是在教师中建立起了广大的队伍，而且在同学们当中几乎是从一年级起就有不少人参加。尤其是同学们在生产劳动中遇到一系列的问题必须要解决，这就必然要推动科学研究工作。例如在淮南煤矿的大队和淮北建井大队，在去年“十一”和今年“元旦”，就完成了科学研究及技术革新共五百七十二项。现在我校科学研究的情况是三多：即参加的人多；完成的项目多；对生产的好处多。
    第六、培养了同学们的组织能力和领导生产的技能。
    第七、增强了师生的体质。尤其是患神经衰弱的人大大地减少了。例如在淮北煤矿参加生产劳动的二百二十四人中，增加体重的就有一百九十八人；患神经衰弱的初去时有六十二人，后来回校时只有七人了。
    总之一句话：优点是说不尽的。但是，党的教育方针对于我们资产阶级知识分子来说，由于受了旧社会资产阶级教育的影响，理论脱离实际，轻视劳动实践，已经深深地烙印于头脑中，它的优点是不容易一下子就体会到的。现在事实已经说明它的无比优越性，它是知识分子劳动化、工农分子知识化的正确道路，我们今后就必须坚决贯彻下去，绝对不应该有丝毫动摇和怀疑的。
    党一再教导我们，社会主义教育的目的是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，建立一个强大的工人阶级知识分子的队伍，为建设社会主义和实现共产主义而服务。要达到这个目的，就需要具有社会主义和共产主义思想的，能够献身于工人阶级教育事业的一支又红又专的庞大的教师队伍。只有又红又专，才能具有坚定的工人阶级政治方向，全心全意地为工人阶级的政治服务，忠心耿耿地为社会主义教育事业贡献自己的力量。
    一年多以来，经过大跃进的高潮，经过教育革命的运动，虽然受到了一系列的共产主义教育，使我的思想认识有了很大的提高，但作为一个社会主义的教育工作者来说，还是远远不够的，还是不能适应社会主义教育事业的需要，为此，就必须继续加强自我改造。我应当努力争取做到又红又专，在党的领导下，更好地继续贯彻执行党的教育方针，为祖国的社会主义教育事业而奋斗到底。
