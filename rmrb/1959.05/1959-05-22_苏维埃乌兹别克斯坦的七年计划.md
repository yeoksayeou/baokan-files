The Soviet state has entered a new historical stage of development. The construction of communism, dreamed of by the outstanding minds of mankind for hundreds of years, has now become the direct task and vivid, concrete daily practice of the Soviet people of all nationalities.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted a magnificent program for the comprehensive construction of communist society. Never before in world history has there been such a great plan for economic and cultural construction. The control figures of the Seven-Year Plan are extremely exciting. It fills the hearts of the Soviet people with legitimate pride. They are proud of their great socialist motherland, their beloved Communist Party, their country's leading position in the world's progress, and its opening up a path of happiness and prosperity for all mankind.

It is enough to mention the fact that the increase in our country's industrial production in seven years will be equal to the increase in the past two decades to illustrate the point. Agricultural production will reach a level that can fully meet the needs of residents for food and industry for raw materials. The living standards of the working people will be further improved, and the achievements of science and culture will be even more brilliant.

The Seven-Year Plan opens up unlimited room for the further economic and cultural prosperity of the Soviet republics. This is a new and vivid manifestation of the Communist Party's tireless concern for the correct combination of the interests of the republics with the interests of the whole country. This is the concrete realization of the great principles of Lenin's wise national policy.

The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that priority should be given to the development of those departments in each republic that possess extremely favorable natural and economic conditions. This makes it possible to utilize the resources of the republic more fully and effectively, and to ensure the correct combination of local and national interests.

All this will promote the further consolidation of economic ties between the republics, the expansion of the socialist division of labor, and the strengthening of the unbreakable friendship and close cooperation of the Soviet people of all nationalities.

The Uzbek people, like the Soviet people of all nationalities, look back with great excitement and joy at the victorious path opened up in the years of Soviet power, and look forward with confidence to a more beautiful communist tomorrow. In the equal and fraternal family of all nationalities in the multi-ethnic Soviet state, the Uzbek people have found their true happiness and tranquility. The unprecedented growth of the republic's economy has determined the continuous improvement of the people's material and spiritual living standards.

In the years of Soviet power, Uzbekistan has become a highly developed socialist republic with a strong industry, large-scale mechanized agriculture, and advanced science and culture.

If before the October Revolution there were only a few small enterprises (mainly cotton ginning mills) on the land of present-day Uzbekistan, now the Republic of Uzbekistan has more than 1,300 large enterprises equipped with modern technology in more than seventy industrial sectors. These include metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical industry, coal mining, petroleum, radio, electrical technology and other industrial sectors. A number of new industrial cities have grown up in the republic. In recent years, the speed of our national economic development has been particularly fast, and the development has been multi-faceted. This is the result of the major measures taken by the Party in industry and agriculture, and the implementation of the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Before the revolution, 98% of the population in the Uzbekistan area was illiterate, and the children of the working people could not afford to go to school. However, in the Soviet era, the residents of the republic have forever ended illiteracy, implemented seven-year compulsory education for children, and widely developed secondary and higher education.

In the development of higher education, Uzbekistan has far surpassed many capitalist countries in Western Europe. Various sectors of the national economy are equipped with skilled experts. The Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of Uzbekistan, and more than 100 scientific research institutes and universities with more than 8,000 scientific workers are carrying out huge scientific work in the republic.

However, the Uzbek people feel even greater joy about their tomorrow. In the Seven-Year Plan that has already begun, the economy of Soviet Uzbekistan will undergo major qualitative changes. These changes are first manifested in the electrification, mechanization, and automation of the production process, and the further attainment of a higher technical level in the entire national economy. In the Seven-Year Plan, the state investment in the national economy of the republic will be 35 to 36 billion rubles, which is 1.4 times more than in the past seven years.

The rich natural resources discovered recently can enable the heavy industry sector to have huge development.

The metallurgical industry, especially the non-ferrous metal industry, will have significant development. In 1965, the total output of non-ferrous metals will be 6.5 times that of 1958. The republic will provide the country with large quantities of copper, lead, zinc and other non-ferrous metals. The production of hard alloys will increase threefold. Electricity production will increase 1.5 times, and in 1965, electricity production per capita will be 1,315 kWh.

Not long ago, extremely rich natural gas resources were discovered near the ancient city of Bukhara in Central Asia. This is of extraordinary significance to the republic's economy. The gas reserves in Gazli alone amount to trillions of cubic meters. We plan to extract more than 18 billion cubic meters of gas in 1965.

This will enable us to implement gasification in many cities and workers' villages, convert the power of a large number of industrial enterprises and power stations from coal to gas, and ensure that the chemical industry has cheap raw materials. The output of the chemical industry will triple in seven years.

The composition of fuel will also change dramatically. If gas accounted for only 3.3% of the republic's fuel in 1958, then in 1965 gas will account for 60% of all fuel used in Uzbekistan. Coal will take a secondary position, and its proportion in fuel will decrease from 76% to 22%.

The significance of the new natural gas resources will far exceed the scope of our republic. In the Seven-Year Plan that has already begun, we will not only transport gas to the neighboring Central Asian Soviet republics, but also to the distant Ural industrial area.

It can be seen that during the Seven-Year Plan, Uzbekistan will become a huge center of our country's gas industry and chemical industry.

In the Seven-Year Plan that has already begun, the machine manufacturing industry will have huge development, especially the machines needed for cotton planting industry will increase. At the same time, Uzbekistan will occupy a huge proportion in the production of equipment for the mining and chemical industries in the Soviet Union, as well as the production of electrical equipment and radio equipment. The output of light industry and food industry will also increase greatly. In seven years, the total industrial output will approximately increase 1.8 times.

The Republic of Uzbekistan can be said to be the main cotton production base of the Soviet Union, and approximately two-thirds of the cotton purchased throughout the Soviet Union comes from Uzbekistan.

By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the production of raw cotton will reach 3.6 to 3.8 million tons, an increase of 700,000 to 800,000 tons compared with 1958. For this, huge work must be carried out to improve cotton production by widely adopting new and progressive agricultural technologies and expanding the sown area. We now put forward a task: to complete the integrated mechanization of cotton field cultivation and cotton picking in the next few years.

Important agricultural sectors such as sericulture, Karakul sheep breeding, grape growing and fruit tree industry will also be greatly developed.

The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the material welfare of the working people should be further greatly improved. The consumption fund of the republic's residents will increase by 60%-63%. The actual income of workers and staff members per worker will increase by an average of 40%, while the income of collective farmers will increase by more than 50%. Great attention is also paid to the construction of housing and public facilities. In 1959-1965, houses with a total area of 14.5 million square meters will be built in cities and workers' villages. This is twice as much as the houses built in the past seven years. In addition, in rural areas, collective farms and villagers will invest in the construction of 323,000 well-equipped standard houses, as well as many cultural and living facilities.

The era of the Seven-Year Plan that has already begun is an era of even greater improvement in the cultural level of the working masses. According to the decree passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, huge work will be carried out in strengthening the connection between schools and life and further developing national education. During this period, secondary and higher vocational schools will train 222,500 experts with higher and secondary proficiency, which is 1.5 times that of the past seven years.

Literature and art will further flourish. The network of cultural and educational institutions (cultural palaces, clubs, cinemas and libraries) will be greatly increased. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the annual circulation of newspapers and magazines will exceed 410 million copies, which is doubled. By 1965, 32.5 million books will be published, an increase of 50% compared with 1958.

The working people of Uzbekistan are starting to implement the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy with great enthusiasm, exceptionally high patriotism and high labor enthusiasm. All enterprises, construction sites, collective farms and state-owned farms are full of creative passion. Industrial and agricultural workers have put forward high socialist guarantee conditions and are determined to complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The Uzbek people, like the Soviet people of all nationalities, deeply realize that all their achievements, happiness, and better future should be attributed to the constant care of the Party and the government, the Party's Leninist national policy, the unbreakable friendship of the people of all nationalities in our country, and their mutual assistance and brotherhood.

This sacred friendship is the strong foundation of our multi-ethnic socialist country. The Uzbek people regard further consolidation of this friendship, their infinite loyalty to the great banner of Lenin, and their close unity around the Communist Party as a guarantee for their new achievements on the road to communism.

The Soviet people regard the successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan as an internationalist obligation to the working people of the world. The Seven-Year Plan opens up brilliant prospects for expanding economic, scientific and technological cooperation between socialist countries. The new upsurge in the economy and culture of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the entire world socialist system will be conducive to the struggle of the working class and all working people in capitalist countries for their own interests, for peace, democracy and socialism.

    苏维埃乌兹别克斯坦的七年计划
    苏联乌兹别克斯坦共产党中央委员会第一书记　拉希多夫
    苏维埃国家进入了新的历史发展时期。几百年以来人类的优秀智慧所梦想的共产主义建设，如今成了苏联各族人民直接的任务和生动具体的日常实践。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会，通过了全面建设共产主义社会的宏伟纲领。世界历史上从来没有过这样伟大的经济和文化建设计划。七年计划的控制数字十分激动人心。它使苏联人的心里充满了正当的自豪。他们为自己伟大的社会主义祖国、为亲爱的共产党、为我们国家走在全世界进步的最前列和替全人类开辟幸福、繁荣的道路，而感到自豪。
    只要举出七年内我国工业产品产量的增加将等于近二十年来增加的数量这一事实，就足以说明问题了。农业生产将达到能够充分满足居民对粮食的需要和工业对原料的需要水平。劳动人民的生活水平要更加提高，科学和文化的成就也会更加辉煌。
    七年计划为苏联各加盟共和国的经济、文化的进一步繁荣，开辟了无限的活动余地。这是共产党不倦地关怀各加盟共和国同全国利益正确结合的新的鲜明表现。这是英明的列宁民族政策伟大原则的具体实现。
    七年计划规定在各个加盟共和国首先发展那些拥有极有利的自然条件和经济条件的部门。这就有可能更充分有效地利用共和国的资源，并保证地方利益和全国利益的正确结合。
    这一切将促进各加盟共和国间经济联系的进一步巩固、社会主义分工的扩大，以及苏联各族人民牢不可破友谊和密切合作的加强。
    乌兹别克人民和苏联各族人民一样，怀着极大的兴奋和愉快心情，回顾在苏维埃政权年代所开辟的胜利道路，并且信心百倍地展望着更加美好的共产主义明天。在多民族苏维埃国家各族人民平等友爱的大家庭里，乌兹别克人民找到了自己的真正幸福和安宁。共和国经济的史无前例的增长，决定了人民物质与精神生活水平的不断提高。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，乌兹别克斯坦已经变成了拥有强大工业、大规模机械化农业和先进科学与文化的、高度发达的社会主义共和国。
    如果说在十月革命前，在现今乌兹别克斯坦的土地上只有少数的小企业（主要是轧花厂）的话，那么现在乌兹别克共和国拥有七十多个工业部门的、以现代技术装备的一千三百多个大企业。其中包括冶金、机器制造、化学、采煤、石油、无线电、电气技术及其它工业部门。共和国内成长起一批新的工业城市。近年来我们的国民经济发展速度特别快，而且发展是多方面的。这是党在工农业方面采取了重大措施，以及苏共第二十次代表大会历史性决议实现的结果。
    在革命前，乌兹别克斯坦地方的人口有98％是文盲，劳动人民的子弟上不起学。但是，在苏维埃时期，共和国的居民永远结束了文盲状态，实行了儿童的七年义务教育，广泛地发展了中等和高等教育。
    在发展高等教育方面，乌兹别克斯坦把西欧许多资本主义国家远远地抛在后面。国民经济的各部门配备了熟练的专家。乌兹别克共和国科学院、乌兹别克农业科学院，以及有八千多名科学工作者的一百多个科学研究所和高等学校，在共和国内进行着巨大的科学工作。
    但是，乌兹别克人民对自己的明天感到更大的欢欣鼓舞。在已经开始的七年计划中，苏维埃乌兹别克斯坦的经济将发生重大的质变。这些变化首先表现为生产过程的电气化、机械化、自动化，以及整个国民经济进一步达到更高的技术水平。在七年计划中，共和国国民经济的国家投资为三百五十至三百六十亿卢布，比过去的七年多一点四倍。
    近来发现的丰富的天然资源，可以使重工业部门有巨大的发展。
    冶金工业，特别是有色金属工业将有显著的发展。1965年有色金属的总产量将为1958年的六点五倍。共和国将给国家提供大量的铜、铅、锌及其它有色金属。硬质合金将增加三倍。电力的生产将增加一点五倍，而1965年按人口计算的电力生产将为一千三百一十五度。
    不久前在中亚细亚古城布哈拉附近发现了极丰富的天然煤气资源。这对共和国的经济具有异常重大的意义。仅加兹林一地的煤气储量就达数万亿立方公尺。我们预定在1965年开采一百八十多亿立方公尺的煤气。
    这就使我们能在许多城市和工人村实行煤气化，使大批工业企业、电站的动力从煤炭改用煤气，并保证化学工业有低廉的原料。七年内化学工业产品将增加三倍。
    燃料的构成情况也将发生急剧的变化。如果说在1958年煤气在共和国的燃料中只占3.3％，那末1965年煤气在乌兹别克斯坦使用的全部燃料中占60％。煤将退居次要地位，它在燃料中所占比重将从76％减为22％。
    新的天然煤气资源的意义，将远远超出我们共和国的范围。在已经开始的七年计划中，我们不仅向邻近的中央亚细亚苏维埃共和国，而且向遥远的乌拉尔工业区输送煤气。
    由此可见，在七年计划时期，乌兹别克斯坦将成为我国煤气工业和化学工业的巨大中心。
    在已开始的七年计划中，机器制造业将有巨大的发展，特别是植棉业所需要的机器将会增加。同时，乌兹别克斯坦在苏联采矿和化学工业的设备生产方面，以及电气设备和无线电器材的生产方面将占有巨大的比重。轻工业和食品工业的产量也将大大增加。七年内工业总产量大约增为一点八倍。
    乌兹别克共和国可以说是苏联的主要产棉基地，苏联全国所收购的棉花中大约三分之二是乌兹别克的棉花。
    到七年计划结束时，原棉的生产将达到三百六十至三百八十万吨，比1958年增加七、八十万吨。为此就要进行巨大的工作，以广泛采用新的进步农业技术和扩大播种面积方法来提高棉产量。我们现在提出一个任务：在最近几年内完成棉田耕作和摘棉的综合机械化。
    像养蚕、养卡拉库里种绵羊、种葡萄和果树业这些重要的农业部门，也将大大发展起来。
    七年计划规定进一步大大地提高劳动人民的物质福利。共和国居民的消费基金，将增加60％—63％。按每个工作人员计算，工人和职员的实际收入，将平均增加40％，而集体农民的收入将增加50％以上。住宅和公用设施的建设，也受到格外的重视。在1959—1965年内，城市和工人村将修建总面积达一千四百五十万平方公尺的住宅。这比过去七年修建的住宅多二倍。此外，在农村里，将由集体农庄和庄员出资修建三十二万三千幢设备良好的标准住宅，以及许多文化生活设施。
    已经开始的七年计划的年代，是劳动群众文化水平更为大大提高的年代。根据苏联最高苏维埃通过的法令，将在加强学校同生活的联系、进一步发展国民教育方面进行巨大的工作。在这个时期里，中等和高等专业学校将培养出二十二万二千五百名具有高等和中等熟练程度的专家，为过去七年的一点五倍。
    文学和艺术将进一步蓬勃发展起来。文化教育机关网（文化宫、俱乐部、电影院和图书馆）将大大增加。到七年计划末，报纸和杂志的年度发行量将超过四亿一千万份，即增加一倍。到1965年将出版三千二百五十万册图书，比1958年增加50％。
    乌兹别克斯坦的劳动人民，怀着极大的热忱、格外高涨的爱国主义和高度的劳动热情来着手实现发展国民经济的七年计划。在一切企业、工地、集体农庄和国营农场都充满着创造的激情。工农业劳动者提出了高度的社会主义保证条件，并且坚决提前完成七年计划的任务。
    乌兹别克人民和苏联各族人民一样，深深地意识到自己的一切成就、幸福、更加美好的将来，都应归功于党和政府不断的关怀、党的列宁主义民族政策、我国各族人民牢不可破的友谊，以及他们的互助和兄弟之谊。
    这种神圣的友谊，是我们多民族社会主义国家强大的基础。乌兹别克人民把进一步巩固这种友谊、自己无限忠于伟大的列宁旗帜，以及密切地团结在共产党的周围，看作是自己在走向共产主义道路上取得新成就的保障。
    苏联人民把成功地完成七年计划看作是对全世界劳动人民的国际主义义务。七年计划为扩大社会主义国家间的经济与科学技术合作开辟了辉煌的远景。苏联、中华人民共和国和整个世界社会主义体系在经济和文化上的新高涨，将有利于资本主义国家的工人阶级和全体劳动人民为争取切身利益、争取和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。（附图片）
