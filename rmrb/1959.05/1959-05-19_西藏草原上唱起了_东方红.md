Huang Yide, a model health worker from a unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Tibetan grasslands, recounted a story of the People's Liberation Army and Tibetan compatriots jointly eliminating bandits at the Second Congress of Advanced Units and Activists in Logistics Work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The story took place in a snow-capped mountain over 6,000 meters high on the Tibetan Plateau. A cavalry company of a certain PLA unit where Huang Yide was stationed rushed to a grassland deep in the snow-capped mountains to pursue and suppress bandits. Here, wind and rain alternated, hailstorms occurred from time to time, and the air was particularly thin. Suddenly, bright lights appeared in front of them, and under the flashing lights, a group of figures could be vaguely seen moving. "Are they the enemy?" Company Commander Li Fazai immediately ordered the troops to prepare for battle. The soldiers galloped past, brandishing their sabers. As they got closer, they saw more than a thousand Tibetan herdsmen wearing tattered clothes. When the herdsmen saw the People's Liberation Army, they enthusiastically shouted, "Jinzhumami (Liberation Army), Yamu (good)!" "Chairman Mao, Yamu, Bagshicha's (top good)!" and flocked forward to welcome them. Then, they began to recount the towering crimes of the "devils"—the bandits: the day before, the bandits had looted their yak farm, kidnapped more than fifty young adults, raped women, burned down cattle sheds, and robbed them of their butter, tea, highland barley flour, and hundreds of yaks. The herdsmen gnashed their teeth in hatred and unanimously demanded that the People's Liberation Army avenge them!

Company Commander Li Fazai and Deputy Instructor Wei Jinshan immediately expressed the determination of all the officers and soldiers of the company to "completely annihilate the bandits and eliminate harm for the Tibetan compatriots." Upon hearing this, the herdsmen were overjoyed and led the troops to the pasture, helping the soldiers set up camps.

Early the next morning, the soldiers forgot the fatigue of the long march and rushed to the pasture to help the herdsmen build cattle sheds, repair cattle yards, pick up cow hair, carry water, and make butter. When the soldiers saw that many poor herdsmen were already out of food, they automatically requested from their superiors to give the Tibetan compatriots who were suffering from hunger the rice they were carrying.

Huang Yide also carried a Red Cross medical kit and traveled day and night on the pasture with a translator, going from tent to tent to treat the herdsmen. In a few days, he had cured more than 170 Tibetan compatriots. One day, he approached a dilapidated, dark tent and heard crying inside. He and the translator immediately went in and saw a Tibetan old woman in her seventies weeping beside a boy of about ten years old. The boy's face was sallow, his whole body was convulsing, and he was making a weak groaning sound. Huang Yide immediately diagnosed the child's condition. It turned out that the child's foot had been burned and was festering. After checking his temperature, it was as high as 40.3 degrees, and the child's life was in danger. The old woman prostrated herself and begged the "divine doctor" to cure her grandson and preserve the only descendant of her family, because the child's father had been kidnapped by the bandits and his mother had been killed by the bandits.

The child's name was Tsering Gyatso. Huang Yide first injected the child with penicillin and then applied ointment to his foot. Huang Yide and the child's grandmother stayed by the child's side to take care of him, giving him injections, medicine, and taking care of his excrement and urine on time. The next day, the child's temperature dropped to 37 degrees, and he began to ask for water and food.

Thirteen days later, Tsering Gyatso had fully recovered. He learned his first sentence in Chinese from the translator: "Thank you, PLA uncle!" The old grandmother immediately led her grandson, carrying butter, milk dregs, and hada, to the company headquarters to thank the "living Bodhisattva who saved his life!" The company commander politely declined the gift from the old woman, saying, "Old lady! This is what we should do. In order for the Tibetan people to live a free and happy life, we will help you do more things."

That same evening, Tsering Gyatso's grandmother quietly walked into the snow-capped mountains with zanba and milk dregs on her back. When she left home, she told her grandson, "Go graze the cattle. I will find your father, let him escape from suffering, return home, and repay the kindness of the People's Liberation Army." After his grandmother left, Tsering Gyatso got up early in the morning, sang "The East is Red" to graze the cattle; when he returned home in the evening, he tied up the yaks and ran to the cavalry company's camp, asking the "PLA uncle" to teach him to sing "Socialism is Good" again. He also brought many Tibetan children to have the PLA uncles teach them to sing.

Songs of joy and freedom floated over the pasture. The soldiers looked forward day and night to the safe return of the old grandmother. On the morning of the fourth day, the old grandmother suddenly appeared at the entrance of the company headquarters with her son and another young herdsman who had been coerced by the bandits, and handed over two rifles to the company commander. The company commander immediately warmly welcomed them on behalf of the People's Liberation Army. The old grandmother looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the company headquarters and shed tears of gratitude. Her son also prostrated himself on the ground, repeatedly kowtowing to the portrait of Chairman Mao, and resolutely begged the company commander, "I want to destroy all the devils with you!"

Then, this honest and brave Tibetan herdsman often appeared at the front of the People's Liberation Army's bandit suppression troops, acting as a guide. He bravely and vigilantly led the cavalry company, traversing mountains and ridges, climbing cliffs and walls, and pursuing and annihilating the bandits in the snow-capped mountains. At the same time, he also propagated the Party's ethnic policies among the herdsmen, exposed the bandits' various atrocities, and encouraged the villagers to bring back the children who had been kidnapped by the bandits. In just over ten days, more than forty young and middle-aged herdsmen on this grassland pasture had escaped from the bandit dens, surrendered their weapons to the cavalry company, and reported the enemy's situation.

On the eve of the cavalry company's order to besiege the last remnant bandits in this snow-capped mountain, the herdsmen spontaneously organized a yak transport team to provide transportation for the cavalry company. Tsering Gyatso's father was one of the leaders of this transport team, leading all of his yaks. In the day and night pursuit and suppression of bandits, they followed the troops forward, delivering ammunition and food in time, ensuring that the troops quickly annihilated the remnant bandits and captured more than 500 bandits alive.

The battle ended victoriously. The cavalry company and the herdsmen's transport team returned to the pasture together. In order to repay the Tibetan compatriots' enthusiastic support and relieve the poor herdsmen, the cavalry company was ordered to distribute all the more than 2,000 jin of grain seized from the bandits to the herdsmen. It was a festival full of infinite joy and friendship. The snow-capped mountain pasture was boiling! Tibetan compatriots and soldiers danced the "Tap Dance" together, sang "The East is Red," and celebrated the new life of the Tibetan people.

    西藏草原上唱起了“东方红”
    新华社记者　姜庆肇
    来自西藏草原上的人民解放军某部模范卫生员黄一德，在中国人民解放军第二届后勤工作先进单位和积极分子代表会议上，讲述了他亲身经历的一段人民解放军和藏胞共同消灭叛匪的故事。
    事情发生在西藏高原一座六千多公尺的雪山里。黄一德所在的解放军某部骑兵连为了追剿叛匪，星夜赶到雪山深处的一片草原上。这儿风雨交加，时有冰雹，空气特别稀薄。突然，在他们前面出现了闪亮的灯光，在闪光下可以隐约看到一群人影在浮动。“是敌人吗？”连长李法仔马上命令部队准备战斗。战士们纵马舞刀，飞驰过去，到近处一看，却是一千多名身着破衣烂衫的藏族牧民。牧民们见了解放军，一面热情地高呼着：“金珠玛米（解放军），亚木（好）！”“毛主席，亚木，巴格什查的（顶好）！”一面拥上前来欢迎。接着，他们纷纷哭诉起“魔鬼”——叛匪的滔天罪行：在前一天，叛匪洗劫了他们的牦牛场，绑走了五十多个青壮年，奸淫了妇女，烧毁了牛棚，抢走了他们的酥油、茶叶、青稞面和几百只牦牛。牧民痛恨地咬牙切齿，一致要求解放军为他们报仇雪恨！
    连长李法仔和副指导员魏金山，当场代表全连指战员向牧民们表达了“全歼叛匪为藏胞除害”的决心，牧民们一听，都高兴起来，把部队领到牧场上，帮助战士们扎下了营房。
    第二天一早，战士们忘记了长途跋涉的劳累，一齐跑到牧场上，帮助牧民们搭牛棚，修建拴牛场，捡牛毛、背水和打酥油……。当战士们看到许多贫苦的牧民已经无粮断炊时，便自动地向上级请求，把自己背的大米，送给饥饿中的藏胞。
    黄一德也背着红十字医药包，同翻译一起，昼夜穿行在牧场上，挨门逐户地走进帐篷，为牧民们治病。几天之中，就治好了一百七十多个藏胞的病。有一天，他走近一座破烂、黑暗的帐篷，听见里面一阵哭泣声。他和翻译立即走进去，看见一位七十多岁的藏族老太太，守候在一个十多岁的男孩子身边痛哭，那孩子面色腊黄，浑身抽搐，发出微弱的呻吟声。黄一德马上给孩子诊断病情，原来这孩子的脚被火烧烂了，直往外流脓。再检查一下体温，已经高到四十度点三了，孩子的生命处在垂危中。老太太伏地拜求“神医生”千万要给她孙儿治好病，保全她家留下这个后代。因为孩子的父亲已经被叛匪绑走，母亲也被叛匪杀死了。
    孩子的名字叫四郎嘉错。黄一德先用青霉素给孩子注射，后又在孩子脚上涂了药膏。黄一德还和孩子的老祖母一起，守候在孩子身边服侍，按时给打针、吃药、端屎端尿。第二天，孩子的体温便下降到三十七度，而且开始要水喝，要东西吃了。
    十三天后，四郎嘉错完全恢复了健康，他从翻译那里学会了第一句汉语：“谢谢，解放军叔叔！”老祖母当即领着孙儿，携带酥油、奶渣和哈达，来到连部，感谢“救命的活菩萨！”连长婉言谢绝了老人家送来的礼物，他说：“老大娘！这是我们应该做的事。为了藏族人民能过自由幸福的生活，我们还要帮助你们办更多的事情哩。”
    就在这一天傍晚，四郎嘉错的祖母背着糌粑和奶渣，悄悄地向大雪山里走去。她在离开家门的时候，叮嘱孙儿说：“你放牛去吧。我要找回你的父亲，让他脱离苦难，回到家来，报答解放军的恩情。”祖母走后，四郎嘉错便清早起来，唱着“东方红”去放牛；晚上回家，他拴好牦牛，就跑到骑兵连的营地，找“解放军叔叔”再教他唱“社会主义好”。他还领来很多的藏族孩子们，要解放军叔叔教他们唱歌。
    欢乐和自由的歌声，飘荡在牧场上。战士们日夜盼望着老祖母安全归来。在第四天上午，老祖母突然带领着她的儿子和另一个被叛匪裹胁去的青年牧民，出现在连部门口，向连长交上了两支步枪。连长当即代表人民解放军热烈欢迎他们。老祖母望着连部挂的毛主席像，流下了感激的眼泪。她的儿子也扑伏在地，一再向毛主席像拜谢，并坚决地向连长恳求：“我要和你们一起把魔鬼统统消灭光！”
    接着，这位诚实、勇敢的藏族牧民，便经常出现在人民解放军剿匪部队的前头，充当了向导。他勇敢机警地带领着骑兵连，翻山越岭，攀崖走壁，追歼着雪山里的叛匪。在这同时，他还在牧民中宣传党的民族政策，揭露叛匪的种种暴行，鼓励乡亲们去把被叛匪绑走的子弟找回来。只十多天，这个草原牧场上，便有四十多个青壮年牧民从匪穴中逃跑回来了，他们向骑兵连缴了武器，并且报告了匪情。
    当骑兵连奉命向这座雪山里的最后一股残匪围攻的前夕，牧民们又自动组织起一支牦牛运输队，为骑兵连担任运输。四郎嘉错的父亲便是这个运输队中的一个负责人，他牵着自己的全部牦牛。在日日夜夜的追剿叛匪的进军中，他们一直跟随部队前进，及时地把弹药、粮食送上去，保证部队很快地剿灭了残匪，活捉叛匪五百多名。
    战斗胜利结束了。骑兵连和牧民运输队又一起回到牧场。为了报答藏胞的热情支援和救济贫苦牧民，骑兵连奉命把缴获叛匪的两千多斤粮食，全部分给了牧民们。这是个充满无限欢乐和友谊的节日。雪山牧场上沸腾了！藏胞和战士们一道跳起了“踢踏舞”，唱起了“东方红”，欢庆藏族人民的新生。
