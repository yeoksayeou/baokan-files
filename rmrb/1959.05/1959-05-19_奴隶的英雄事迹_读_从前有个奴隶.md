Heroic Deeds of a Slave
——Reading "Once a Slave"
Weilang

A slave, not knowing the day of his birth, not knowing who his parents were, nor knowing if he had any relatives, suffered all kinds of bullying from a young age, treated as property, transferred from one slave owner to another. The slave owners wanted him to be obsequious, with his eyes downcast, walking with his head lowered. The slave owners forbade him to think, even forbidding him to dream in his sleep. However, he was unwilling to endure servitude, overcame numerous dangers, broke free from the shackles of slavery, dedicated himself to the struggle to abolish slavery, and became an outstanding politician and orator, a fighter for the liberation of black people.

This is the protagonist of Shirley Graham's famous biographical novel "Once a Slave"—Frederick Douglass, the most outstanding black leader in 19th-century America.

American blacks, from the 15th century onwards, were abducted from Africa to the Americas by colonialists. For hundreds of years, they have been subjected to extremely cruel enslavement, oppression, and exploitation by slave owners and capitalists, but they have not yielded. In order to smash the slave system, many of them had long been involved in the abolitionist movement and held armed resistance. In the period from the beginning of the 19th century to the Civil War alone, there were as many as eighty such armed resistances. Although many black leaders who led resistance and uprisings were killed, the black liberation struggle never stopped. These admirable and moving figures and events always have the power to attract us.

Opening "Once a Slave," we first see a tragic scene. Douglass was beaten half to death by a white man who "tamed slaves" and lay in the bushes of a swamp. Why was he beaten? Only because he had attended school with the young master, accidentally learned to read, and was reluctant to put down his books, while the slave owner believed that black people being literate was "against the law, and reading would spoil the best black people in the world."

From here, the author vividly describes how Douglass worked on the plantation and how he worked in the shipyard. The mistress of the plantation could beat him because his name was too long or his skin was not black enough. After many failures, he finally escaped from the southern United States to the north and joined the abolitionist movement at that time. The book describes how Douglass founded the famous "North Star" newspaper, how he organized black troops to participate in the Civil War, and how he waged a tenacious struggle to abolish slavery and fight for women's suffrage.

In order to maintain their slave system, American slave owners consistently created divisions between black and white workers, inciting white workers to hate black workers. Douglass mercilessly exposed their conspiracy. He said that poor white laborers and black slaves were all slaves of the slave owners, the only difference being: "Black slaves belong to one slave owner, while white slaves belong to the entire body of slave owners." Douglass's words still have profound practical significance in today's America.

The author's depiction of Douglass is very detailed and moving, with strong artistic appeal. From Douglass's life of struggle, we can see the influence of the surrounding environment on him and find the context of his growth and development. His vision is gradually expanding, and his understanding is gradually improving, so he can say: "Although I have a closer relationship with an abused, oppressed, and enslaved race, and am a member of it, I must not be indifferent to the misfortune and suffering of any part of the human family. I am not only an American slave, but also a human being, and as a human being, I have a responsibility to do my best to seek happiness for all my fellow human beings." Douglass's life was a life of fighting for black liberation, and also a life of fighting for human happiness and equality. His struggle was not isolated; not only were his millions of black compatriots with him, but also his countless white brothers were with him. In the cloudy years, he bravely went from one city to another, facing constant attacks by thugs, holding meetings and giving speeches, using his own personal experience to expose the cruelty of the slave system; using his eloquence to refute the fallacies of the defenders of the slave system; and spreading the seeds of freedom and equality to the broad masses. He won the love and respect of all honest people in America. The author made a very vivid description of these. The author shaped a glorious and complete image.

Around Douglass, the author also shaped many unforgettable images. Like Sandy, who rescued Douglass after he was beaten. This is a calm, brave, and extremely clever black man. He not only taught Douglass "black knowledge," but also cultivated Douglass's integrity. The American heroic abolitionist John Brown, the author's many descriptions of him are even more moving. Before being killed by American slave owners, Brown left Douglass a flag and a letter: "Because you are still alive, I know I have not failed. Move forward, one day you will raise my flag on this land of freedom." Today, Brown's flag should be said to have been handed over to more black people, and they will certainly complete the cause left by John Brown and Douglass.

Shirley Graham is an excellent American progressive black female writer and a master of biographical novels. From her "Once a Slave," we not only learn about the heroic deeds of a black leader, but also learn a lot about the history of the American black liberation struggle, which deepens our understanding of the American black liberation struggle today.

    奴隶的英雄事迹
    ——读“从前有个奴隶”
    伟良
    一个奴隶，不知自己生在哪一天，不知自己的父母是谁，也不知自己有些什么亲人，从小受尽欺凌，被当作财产，由一个奴隶主转给另一个奴隶主。奴隶主要他卑躬屈节，双目下视，低着头走路。奴隶主不许他思考，连睡觉也不许他做梦。然而，他却不甘心忍受奴役，历尽艰险，挣脱了奴隶的枷锁，献身于废除奴隶制度的斗争，成为一个杰出的政治家和演说家，一个争取黑人解放的战士。
    这就是雪莉·格雷汉姆的著名传记小说“从前有个奴隶”的主人公——十九世纪美国最杰出的黑人领袖弗雷德里克·道格拉斯。
    美国黑人从十五世纪起，就开始被殖民主义者从非洲劫往美洲。几百年来他们一直受着奴隶主和资本家极端残酷的奴役、压迫和剥削，但是他们并没有屈服。为了粉碎奴隶制度，他们有许多人很早就投入了废奴运动，并且举行了武装反抗。这种武装反抗，单是在十九世纪初到南北战争这一阶段，就有八十起之多。虽然许许多多领导反抗和起义的黑人领袖都被杀害了，可是黑人的解放斗争却始终没有停止。这些可歌可泣的人物和事件，永远具有吸引我们的力量。
    翻开“从前有个奴隶”这本书，我们首先看到的是一幅惨景。道格拉斯被“驯服奴隶”的白人打得半死，躺在沼泽地的灌木丛里。他为什么挨打呢？只是因为他曾经陪少爷上过学，偶然学会了念书，舍不得丢开书本，而奴隶主却认为黑人知书识字是“违犯法律的，念书会把世上最好的黑人惯坏。”
    作者从这里开始，生动地描写了道格拉斯怎样在种植园中干活，怎样在造船厂里做工。种植园的女主人可以因为他的名字太长、他的肤色不够那么黑而打他。经过多次失败，最后他终于从美国南部逃到北部，加入了当时的废奴主义者的队伍。书中描写了道格拉斯怎样创办有名的“北极星报”，怎样组织黑人队伍参加南北战争，怎样为废除奴隶制度，为争取妇女选举权所作的顽强斗争。
    美国的奴隶主们为了维护他们的奴隶制度，一贯在黑种工人和白种工人之间制造分裂，煽动白种工人仇恨黑种工人。道格拉斯无情地揭穿了他们的阴谋。他说穷苦的白人劳动者和黑人奴隶一样都是奴隶主的奴隶，差别不过是：“黑奴是属于一个奴隶主的，而白奴则属于奴隶主的整体。”道格拉斯的这些话，在今天的美国，也仍然有着深刻的现实意义。
    作者对于道格拉斯的描写很细致动人，具有强烈的艺术感染力。我们从道格拉斯一生的斗争，可以看出周围环境给他的影响，找到他的成长和发展的脉络。他的视野在渐次扩大，他的认识在逐步提高，因此他能够说：“虽然我和一个被凌辱、被压迫和被奴役的种族有更密切的关系，而且还是其中的一分子，我对于人类大家庭的任何一部分人的不幸和苦难，决不能漠不关心。我不仅是一个美国奴隶，也是一个人，既然是一个人，我就有责任尽我的力量为全人类的同胞谋幸福。”道格拉斯的一生，是为黑人解放战斗的一生，同时也是为谋人类的幸福、平等战斗的一生。他的斗争并不是孤立的，不但有他的几百万黑人同胞和他在一起，而且也有他的无数白人兄弟和他在一起。在阴云密布的年代，他迎着暴徒的不断袭击，勇敢地从一个城市到另一个城市，集会、演说，用他自己的亲身经历，揭露奴隶制度的残酷；用他的雄辩才能驳斥奴隶制度维护者的种种谬论；把争自由、争平等的种子散播到广大群众中去。他赢得了美国一切正直人们的爱戴和尊敬。作者对这些，作了很生动的描写。作者塑造了一个光辉完整的形象。
    作者围绕着道格拉斯，还塑造了不少令人难忘的形象。如像在道格拉斯遭受毒打后去营救他的桑迪。这是一个沉着、勇敢和极其聪明的黑人。他不仅把“黑人的知识”传授给了道格拉斯，而且还培养了道格拉斯的骨气。美国英勇的废奴主义战士约翰·布朗，作者对他所作的许多描写更是令人感动。布朗在被美国奴隶主杀害以前，曾经留给道格拉斯一面旗和一封信：“因为你还活着，所以我知道我没有失败。前进吧，总有一天你会把我的这面旗帜在这块自由的土地上升起来的。”今天，布朗的旗帜应该说已经交到更多的黑人手中了，他们是一定会完成约翰·布朗和道格拉斯所留下的事业的。
    雪莉·格雷汉姆是一位优秀的美国进步黑人女作家，也是一位传记小说的能手。我们从她的“从前有个奴隶”一书中，不仅知道了一个黑人领袖的英雄事迹，而且也了解了不少美国黑人解放斗争的历史，它加深了我们对今天美国黑人解放斗争的认识。
