Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th. The First Branch Factory of Tianjin Second Steel Plant, in the Red Flag Competition for increasing production and practicing economy, launched a "Twenty Heats Without Defects Short-Distance Competition," and the qualified rate of steel ingots rapidly increased. The steel production plan for the first half of May was completed ahead of schedule, and the qualified rate of steel ingots increased by an average of 12% compared with April.

This factory is a newly built steelmaking plant at the end of last year, and most of the workers are new. In the past, the qualified rate of steel ingots was very low. The "Twenty Heats Without Defects Short-Distance Competition" was a competition proposal put forward by Wang Wenhua, a worker at this factory and a Tianjin Municipal Labor Model, to the brother groups in his factory. This initiative received enthusiastic responses from various groups, and in the first half of May, many groups achieved a record of twenty consecutive heats without defects. Ma Guilin's group at No. 1 converter achieved twenty heats without defects twice in a row, and by the 14th, the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 96%. Chen Yunsheng's group at No. 5 converter completed the production and quality plan in every shift, and had not produced any defective products for thirty-eight consecutive heats.

In order to jointly achieve the goal of improving production and quality, all groups demonstrated a communist style of mutual cooperation and creating conditions for each other in the competition. Workers in Wang Guilin's group at No. 2 furnace saw that No. 4 furnace was working intensely, so they ran over to help clean up the slag. Chen Yunsheng's group at No. 5 furnace cleaned up more than three tons of iron oxide adhering to the water tank in order to create favorable conditions for the next shift.

Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, 17th. In the first half of May, Dalian Steel Plant adopted measures to ensure output and focus on quality. Not only did it complete the output plan, but the qualified rate of steel ingots also increased by 0.35 compared with April, reaching 99.36%; the utilization coefficient of cold charging in the electric furnace reached 42.188 tons, setting a new record.

Since May, Dalian Steel Plant has particularly emphasized achieving high output on the basis of high quality. Each workshop has found many ways to ensure quality through research. In the past, most of the defective products in the steelmaking workshop were caused by steel ingots not being the right size. The reason for this type of accident was mainly that the smelting temperature was not high enough. After the workers found the cause of the defective products, they strictly adhered to the principle of not tapping the steel if the temperature was not high enough during operation. Therefore, the number of short-sized steel ingot accidents has been greatly reduced. The staff in the laboratory shortened the time for testing chemical components such as carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus to a few seconds, and improved the accuracy, which also strongly helped the steelmaking workers to produce steel according to variety and quality. The sulfur content of steel raw materials was high this month, which brought great difficulties to ensuring quality. The workers in each electric furnace learned the rapid desulfurization method of labor model Liu Hongxi, overcame this key problem, and still controlled the sulfur content within the allowable range.

    天津“二十炉无废品”竞赛开花
    大连钢厂的钢锭既优质又高产
    新华社天津17日电　天津第二钢厂一分厂在增产节约红旗竞赛中，开展了“二十炉无废品短距离竞赛”，钢锭的合格率迅速上升。5月上半月的钢产量计划提前完成，钢锭的合格率比4月份平均提高了12％。
    这个厂是去年年底新建成的炼钢厂，大部分是新工人，过去钢锭的合格率很低。“二十炉无废品短距离竞赛”，是这个厂的工人、天津市劳动模范王文华向本厂兄弟小组提出来的竞赛倡议。这一倡议得到了各小组的热烈响应，5月上半月许多小组达到了连续二十炉不出废品的纪录。一号转炉马桂林小组连续两次作到二十炉无废品，到14日止，钢锭的合格率达到96％。五号转炉陈云生小组，班班完成产量质量计划，连续三十八炉没有出过废品。
    为了共同达到提高产量质量的目的，各个小组在竞赛中都发扬了互相协作、互相创造条件的共产主义风格。二号炉王贵林小组的工人看到四号炉工作紧张，就跑过去协助清理渣子。五号炉陈云生小组为给下一班创造有利条件，把沾在水箱上的三吨多氧化铁清理下来。
    新华社旅大17日电　5月上半月，大连钢厂采取保证产量、狠抓质量的措施，不仅完成产量计划，钢锭合格率也比4月份提高零点三五，达到99.36％；电炉冷装利用系数达到四二·一八八吨，又创造新纪录。
    5月份以来，大连钢厂特别强调了在优质的基础上实现高产，各个车间通过研究找出了许多保证质量的办法。炼钢车间过去的废品大多是钢锭不够尺寸造成的，这种事故的原因主要是冶炼温度不够高。职工们找到了产生废品的原因以后，都在操作上严格遵守温度不够就不出钢的原则。因此大大减少了钢锭短尺事故。试验室的工作人员，把化验炭、硫、磷等化学成分的时间缩短到几秒钟，并且提高了准确程度，也有力地帮助了炼钢工人按品种、按质量出钢。本月份钢铁原料含硫量高，给保证质量带来了很大困难。各个电炉上的工人学习了劳动模范刘洪喜的快速脱硫法，攻破了这一关键，仍然把硫的含量控制在允许范围以内。
