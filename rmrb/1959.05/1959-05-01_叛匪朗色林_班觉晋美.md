    Rebel Langse Lin·Banjue Jinmei
    Langse Lin was a major aristocrat in Tibet, originally a son of the Pala family, later becoming an adopted son-in-law of the Langse Linba family. During the time when the imperialist lackey Da Zha Ren served as regent, he was bribed into the position of Zibon. Langse Lin has consistently been reactionary in politics. In 1950, when the Dalai Lama was coerced to flee to Yadong, he also vehemently advocated going abroad and attempted to use foreign forces to separate Tibet from the motherland. He firmly opposed the Seventeen-Article Agreement, saying, "The signing of the agreement means the loss of Tibet's independent status." He was one of the leaders of the reactionary "People's Conference," "People's Leadership," and "Officials' Representatives Conference." He had close ties with the traitor Shagaba and others living in Kalimpong, India. After the Khampa rebels fled to Tibet, he actively supported them, and some rebels even lived in his home. He was also a instigator of the armed rebellion in Lhasa this time.
