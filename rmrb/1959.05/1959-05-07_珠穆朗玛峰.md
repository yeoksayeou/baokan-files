Tibet Local Customs and Scenery

　　Mount Everest
　　Wang Yao
    Mount Everest is the world's highest peak within the borders of our motherland, located in southwestern Tibet. It is the highest of the many peaks in the Himalayas. This beautiful snow peak stands majestically in Tibet like a silver tower, rising to an altitude of over 8,800 meters, displaying unparalleled grandeur and splendor under the sunlight. Our Tibetan compatriots discovered this snow peak very early on, and they called it "Mount Everest" very early on. As early as the fifty-sixth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1717 AD), the name "Mount Everest" was officially recorded in our country's maps. In the " Qianlong Inner Court Atlas," even its location and surrounding borders were recorded in detail. However, the honor of discovering this world's highest peak was long usurped by imperialist elements in the past. In the late nineteenth century, the Indian "Survey Director" – the Englishman Everest, measured Mount Everest with ulterior motives, and arrogantly and shamelessly pretended to be the discoverer of Mount Everest. Driven by the ambition of aggression, the imperialists called it "Everest" Peak. This act of robbery was not exposed until after liberation, and the beautiful Mount Everest regained its due glory and dignity. The restoration of her name illustrates the inseparable close relationship between Tibet and the motherland, and also illustrates the contribution of the Tibetan people to the creation process of the great motherland.

　　珠穆朗玛峰
　　王尧
    珠穆朗玛峰是祖国境内的世界第一高峰，位于西藏西南部。她是喜马拉雅山许多高峰中最高的一个。这个美丽的雪峰像银塔一样巍峨地矗立在西藏，高达海拔八千八百公尺以上，在阳光下显示出无比的雄伟瑰丽。这座雪峰是我们藏族同胞在很早很早以前就发现了的，并且很早就用“珠穆朗玛”来称呼她，远在清朝康熙五十六年（公元1717年）的时候就正式用“珠穆朗玛”的名字载入我国舆图。在“乾隆内府舆图”中，连她的位置、四周边界，都有了详细的记载。可是发现这座世界第一高峰的荣誉，过去曾长期被帝国主义分子窃据了去。十九世纪后期，印度“测量局长”——英国人额菲尔斯别有用心地对珠穆朗玛进行了测量，并且狂妄而无耻地冒称自己是珠穆朗玛的发现人。帝国主义者从侵略的野心出发就把她称做“额菲尔斯”峰。这种强盗行径直到解放后才被揭穿，美丽的珠穆朗玛才恢复了她应有的光荣与尊严。她的名字的恢复，说明了西藏和祖国不可须臾分离的亲密关系，也说明了藏族人民对伟大祖国缔造过程中的贡献。
