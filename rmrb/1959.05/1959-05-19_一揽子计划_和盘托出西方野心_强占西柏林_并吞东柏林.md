Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 17th: Our reporter Zhang Yang reports: The essence of the Western powers' proposal regarding the Berlin issue in the "package plan" presented at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is that they not only attempt to extend their current occupation system in West Berlin and legitimize this occupation, but also want to expand their occupation and annex East Berlin.

The Western countries propose to unify East and West Berlin through so-called "free elections under the supervision of the Four Powers or the United Nations," with the four powers "who will continue to have the right to station troops in Berlin as at present" guaranteeing Western access to Berlin.

It is no accident that the Western countries have put forward such provocative plans. For many years, at the instigation of the three Western occupying powers, especially the United States, West German militarists and revanchists have been engaged in long-term plans, trying every means – including the use of armed force – to "unify" Germany and Berlin. The current Western plan on Berlin is merely part of that old long-term plan, disguised under the new banner of "the West's peace plan."

In the fourteen years since the end of World War II, the Western occupying powers have turned West Berlin into a "frontline city," a center for espionage and sabotage, and a bridgehead for the Cold War. It is a malignant tumor in the body of the German Democratic Republic and the heart of Europe, threatening the peaceful life of the German people and the security of Europe.

Encouraged by the Western countries and protected by the occupation system, militarist and fascist forces are becoming increasingly rampant in West Berlin. According to materials published by the government of the German Democratic Republic, there are approximately 28,000 former officials of fascist state organs in the West Berlin municipal government alone. More than one-third of the police are former Nazi Party members or fascist SS members. In the judicial system, more than half of the officials are former Nazi Party members or judges and prosecutors who served in Hitler's terror courts. More than eighty fascist military organizations and "old comrades" associations are active in West Berlin. The anti-Hitler allies' agreements on democratization and demilitarization have been brutally violated by the Western countries.

Using West Berlin as a base, the West carries out subversion and sabotage activities against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. Currently, there are more than sixty offices of foreign secret intelligence organizations and espionage organizations in West Berlin. They organize spy networks and use the freedom of traffic between West Berlin and the democratic sector of Berlin to send agents and saboteurs to the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. Day and night, radio broadcasts filled with rumors, slanders, and provocations are sent from West Berlin, and publications of this kind are disseminated, poisoning the internal life of Germany and the international atmosphere.

Even recently, after the opening of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the West Berlin municipal government and the Western occupying powers organized parades and rallies in West Berlin to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the end of the "blockade" of West Berlin, filled with Cold War provocations. Such blatant actions are a provocation to the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The West praises West Berlin as "the cheapest atomic bomb." It is quite clear that what they refuse to give up is precisely this "cheapest atomic bomb," and not, as they claim, the people of West Berlin. Their plot is to use this "cheapest atomic bomb" to destroy the lighthouse that points out the future of the entire German nation – East Berlin, and the independent and prosperous German Democratic Republic.

### “一揽子计划”和盘托出西方野心  强占西柏林　并吞东柏林

    “一揽子计划”和盘托出西方野心
    强占西柏林　并吞东柏林
    新华社日内瓦17日电　本社记者张扬报道：西方在外长会议上提出的“一揽子计划”中关于柏林问题的方案的实质是，它们不仅企图延长它们目前在西柏林的占领制度并使这种占领合法化，而且还想扩大它们的占领，并吞东柏林。
    西方国家建议，通过所谓“在四国或者联合国监督下举行的自由选举”来统一东西柏林，由
  “将继续像目前那样有权在柏林驻扎军队”的四国来保证西方进入柏林的通道。
    西方国家提出如此挑衅性的计划，并不是偶然的。许多年来，在西方三个占领国，尤其是美国的唆使下，西德的军国主义者和复仇主义者一直在搞长期的计划，千方百计地——其中包括使用武装力量——企图“统一”德国和柏林。目前的西方关于柏林的方案不过是打着“西方的和平计划”的新招牌的那个老的长期计划的一部分。
    在第二次世界大战结束后的十四年中，西方占领国家已经把西柏林变成一个“前线城市”，一个间谍和破坏活动的中心，冷战的桥头堡。它是德意志民主共和国和欧洲腹心地带的一个毒瘤，它威胁着德国人民的和平生活和欧洲的安全。
    在西方国家的怂恿以及占领制度的保护下，军国主义和法西斯主义势力在西柏林愈来愈嚣张了。根据德意志民主共和国政府发表的材料，单在西柏林的市政府机构里，就有两万八千名左右的前法西斯国家机构的官员。三分之一以上的警察是前纳粹党党徒或法西斯党卫军分子。在司法系统中，半数以上的官员是前纳粹党徒或者是在希特勒的恐怖法院中任过职的法官和检察官。八十多个法西斯军人组织和“老同志”协会在西柏林积极活动。反希特勒盟国关于民主化和非军事化的协议已经被西方国家粗暴地破坏无遗了。
    西方以西柏林为基地，对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家进行颠复和破坏活动。目前，西柏林有外国秘密情报组织和间谍组织的六十多个办事处，他们组织间谍网，利用西柏林和柏林民主区之间交通来往的自由，向德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家派遣特务和破坏分子。日日夜夜从西柏林发出充满了造谣诬蔑和挑衅的无线电广播，散布出这一类的刊物，毒害着德国的内部生活和国际气氛。
    甚至在最近，就在日内瓦外长会议开幕以后，西柏林市政府和西方占领国家还在西柏林组织了庆祝“封锁”西柏林结束十周年的充满冷战挑衅的游行和大会，这种肆无忌惮的行动是对日内瓦外长会议的挑衅。
    西方称赞西柏林是“一个最廉价的原子弹”。十分明显，他们拒绝放弃的正是这个“最廉价的原子弹”，而不是如他们口说的西柏林的人民。他们的图谋是利用这个“最廉价的原子弹”来摧毁指出整个德意志民族前途的灯塔——东柏林，以及自主和繁荣的德意志民主共和国。
