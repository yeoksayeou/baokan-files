We fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the four reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan, respectively. These reports and the magnificent 1959 national economic plan have given us great encouragement. The report on the draft national economic plan clearly proposes to "actively develop the aquatic industry," which makes us scientific and technological workers related to aquatic products particularly excited. Now we would like to talk about our two points of understanding, and ask for correction from all delegates.

In the situation of a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and in the high-speed development of the aquatic industry, the labor force is particularly felt to be insufficient. Aquatic scientific and technological workers should work with the masses to think of more ways from the scientific and technological point of view to obtain more products with less labor, that is, to use technological innovation methods to improve labor productivity and solve the contradiction between insufficient labor and heavy production tasks. Premier Zhou pointed out the importance of improving labor productivity when talking about industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce in his report; this has given us a deeper understanding of the profound significance of technological innovation in improving labor productivity. Although the number of aquatic workers has increased this year, it is still far from being able to adapt to the surge in aquatic production tasks, so in all tasks, we should pay more attention to large-scale technological innovation with the aim of improving labor productivity in a faster, better, and more economical way. The research and application of advanced aquatic science and technology is also a kind of technological innovation, which can effectively improve labor productivity, and domestic work has already begun in this area; however, work in this area should also be actively strengthened. The National Aquatic Science and Technology and Education Work Conference held in the first quarter of this year determined that the guiding principle of this year's aquatic science and technology work is: "Vigorously carry out the technological innovation movement centered on improving labor productivity, promote a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in aquatic production; actively carry out research on advanced aquatic science and technology, and create conditions for a comprehensive leap forward in the aquatic industry." This is completely consistent with the spirit of Premier Zhou's report on improving labor productivity and gradually realizing technological innovation and technological revolution, and is a correct guiding principle that can adapt to this year's leap forward in aquatic production. We warmly support this aquatic science and technology work guiding principle and will implement it well in our work.

Since the liberation of the motherland, under the correct leadership of the Party, the aquatic industry, like other aspects of socialist construction, has developed very rapidly. In 1958, the aquatic industry also had an unprecedented leap forward in the context of the comprehensive leap forward in industry, agriculture, culture, and education in our country, and at the same time, aquatic science and technology also had a great development. In terms of freshwater aquaculture, marine aquaculture, fishing technology, and aquatic product processing, many important achievements have been obtained. The varieties of aquaculture have increased; the application of effective spawning agents and ecological treatment methods can make artificially farmed silver carp and bighead carp spawn, fertilize, and hatch, and can break the natural law of reproductive seasons, so that they can also spawn in autumn; carp can not only spawn in winter, but also spawn every month; artificial seedling breeding of mussels has achieved initial success; prawns can overwinter, spawn, and hatch under aquaculture conditions; kelp aquaculture has been successfully moved from the cold water sea areas of the north to the south; the annual output of freshwater fish per mu can reach 10,000 to 50,000 jin; the yield of marine aquaculture oysters can be as high as 6,500 jin of pure meat per mu, razor clams 22,000 jin, kelp 36,000 jin, and laver 42,000 jin; in addition, intensive farming technology has been further improved, and the eight-character "fish farming sutra" of water, species, bait, density, mixed culture, rotation, protection, and management has been initially summarized. In terms of fishing gear and fishing methods, there have also been many technological innovations and creations, such as all-purpose nets, all-purpose fishing, light net fast towing, fixed fishing gear flowing, double trawls changed to single trawls, and multiple fishing gear for concurrent operations; and the "five-character sutra" of finding, changing, concurrent operation, installation, and protection for fishing has been initially summarized. In order to effectively grasp the fishing grounds and understand the resource situation, a national marine survey and fishing ground survey have been systematically and comprehensively launched. In terms of aquatic product processing, the comprehensive utilization of aquatic products, improving quality, and extracting industrial and medicinal products from aquatic products have been widely developed. The main reasons for these gains are the correct leadership of the Party, the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, and the implementation of the correct aquatic production policy of "relying on the masses, focusing on aquaculture, and actively developing fishing." These factors not only enabled the aquatic industry to have such a big leap forward in 1958, but also created favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in 1959. The correct policy of "relying on the masses, focusing on aquaculture, and actively developing fishing" must continue to be vigorously implemented this year.

Here, we cannot fail to notice that the rapid development of the aquatic industry and the aquatic production tasks of a greater leap forward in 1959 have brought us a series of scientific and technological problems that urgently need to be solved. If these problems cannot be solved in time, they will hinder or delay the development speed of the aquatic industry to varying degrees. Premier Zhou pointed out very correctly in his report that "the tasks that directly serve production and construction should be placed in the primary position." We must implement the spirit of this instruction in our work, and first of all, we must take the scientific and technological problems that directly serve aquatic production and urgently need to be solved as our current primary task, and we must strive to implement the mass line research method and solve such problems as early and as much as possible.

We have done really poorly in this regard in the past, and until now we have not been able to effectively and thoroughly solve any important problems for production. On the one hand, it is limited by the level of science and technology, but more importantly, it is limited by the level of political thought; the bourgeois world outlook, ideological methods, and academic viewpoints have not been completely transformed, so that we have been greatly limited in serving socialist production and construction. Premier Zhou's report has made us further realize the necessity for intellectuals to continue to strengthen self-transformation. We must follow Premier Zhou's instructions to "continue to work hard and gradually realize self-transformation in the long-term practice of future work." We must, under the leadership of the Party, follow the mass line, go all out to carry out aquatic science and technology work, and hope to play a greater role in the socialist production and construction of the motherland.

　　加紧解决水产事业发展中的科学技术问题
    张玺  董聿茂　朱洗代表  朱元鼎　朱树屏委员的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席分别作的四个报告。这些报告和宏伟的一九五九年国民经济计划都给了我们极大的鼓舞。国民经济计划草案的报告明确地提出要“积极发展水产事业”，这使我们和水产有关系的科学技术工作者特别感到兴奋。现在愿谈谈我们的两点体会，就正于各位代表。
    在工农业生产全面大跃进的形势下，在水产事业的高速度发展中劳动力特别感到不足。水产科学技术工作者应从科学技术方面和群众一起多想办法来用较少的劳动力得到较多的产品，就是用技术革新的办法来提高劳动生产率和解决劳动力不足和生产任务重的矛盾。周总理在报告中谈到工业、农业、运输业和商业时，都指出提高劳动生产率的重要性；使我们对技术革新提高劳动生产率的深刻意义有了进一步的体会。今年水产工作者的人数虽有所增加但还远不能与水产生产任务的激增相适应，所以在各项工作中更要注意以提高劳动生产率为目的而多快好省地大闹技术革新。水产尖端科学技术的研究应用也是一种技术革新，可以有效地提高劳动生产率，国内也已经开始进行；但是还应积极加强这方面的工作。今年第一季度内召开的全国水产科学技术和教育工作会议，确定了今年的水产科学技术工作方针是：“大力开展以提高劳动生产率为中心的技术革新运动，推动更大、更好、更全面的水产生产大跃进；积极进行水产尖端科学技术的研究，为水产事业全面大跃进创造条件。”这和周总理报告中提高劳动生产率逐步实现技术革新与技术革命的精神完全一致，是能适应今年水产生产大跃进的正确方针，我们热烈地拥护这个水产科学技术工作方针并要在工作中很好地贯彻。
    祖国解放以来，水产事业在党的正确领导下，和其他各方面的社会主义生产建设一样，发展的非常迅速。一九五八年的水产事业在我国工、农、文、教全面大跃进的形势下也有了一个古今中外史无前例的大跃进，同时水产科学技术也随着有了一个很大的发展。在淡水养殖、海水养殖、捕捞技术、水产品加工等方面都得到了不少重要的成果。养殖的品种增加了；应用有效的催产剂和生态处理方法，可使人工养殖的鲢、鳙产卵受精孵化，并可打破自然的生殖季节规律，在秋季也可使它们产卵；鲤鱼不但可使在冬季产卵，并可月月产卵；贻贝人工育苗已获初步成功；对虾已能在养殖的条件下越冬，产卵，孵化；海带养殖已从北方冷水海区南移成功；淡水养鱼每亩年产量可达一至四、五万斤；海水养殖亩产量牡蛎纯肉已可高达六千五百斤，蛏子二万二千斤，海带三万六千斤，紫菜四万二千斤；此外并进一步提高了精养技术，初步总结出了水、种、饵、密、混、轮、保、管八字“养鱼经”。在渔具渔法方面，同样有了许多技术革新和创造如万能网、万能钓、轻网快拖、定置渔具流动化、双拖改单拖、多种渔具兼作业等等；并初步总结出了捕鱼的找、改、兼、安、保“五字经”。为了有效地掌握渔场和摸清资源情况，全国性的海洋普查和渔场调查已经系统地全面展开了。在水产品加工方面已广泛地展开了水产品综合利用、提高品质，从水产品中制取工业及医药用品等等研究工作。这些收获的主要原因是党的正确领导，社会主义建设总路线的指引和“依靠群众，以养为主，积极发展捕捞”的水产生产正确方针的贯彻。这些因素不但使一九五八年的水产事业有了这样一个大跃进，同时也为一九五九年更大的跃进创造了有利的条件。“依靠群众，以养殖为主，积极发展捕捞”的正确方针，今年必须继续大力贯彻。
    在此我们也不能不注意到水产事业的迅速发展和一九五九年更大跃进的水产生产任务给我们带来了一系列的急待解决的科学技术问题。这些问题不能及时解决就会在不同程度上阻碍或推迟水产事业的发展速度。周总理在报告中很正确地指出“直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位。”我们要把这个指示的精神贯彻到工作中去，首先要把直接为水产生产服务而急待解决的科学技术问题作为我们目前的首要任务，并要努力贯彻群众路线的研究方法，尽早尽多地解决这样的问题。
    我们以往在这方面做得实在是太差了，直到现在还没能真正有效而彻底地为生产解决过什么重要问题。一方面固然是限于科学技术的水平，但更重要的是限于政治思想水平；资产阶级的世界观，思想方法和学术观点还未能彻底地改造过来，因而使我们在为社会主义生产建设服务方面受到了很大的限制。周总理的报告使我们进一步认识到知识分子继续加强自我改造的必要性。我们一定要依照周总理的指示“继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造”，我们一定要在党的领导下，走群众路线，鼓足干劲进行水产科学技术工作，冀能在祖国的社会主义生产建设中多发挥一些作用。
