Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, May 21st. According to a report in the Ceylon "Daily News" on the 20th, the Ceylon "Buddhist Monks Association," hastily organized after the Tibetan rebellion with the active planning and support of the pro-Western United National Party, is currently plotting to launch a so-called "Boycott China Movement."

The news said that this "Association" will hold a public gathering on the 31st of this month, where Gennanissara, a well-known supporter of the United National Party, the organizer and head of this reactionary association, will present a so-called report on their meeting with the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie to instigate an anti-China movement. The news also said that this association will "call on all Buddhist countries not to trade with China" and will establish a committee with the participation of "representatives" from other Buddhist countries to "organize a movement to boycott China." In addition, another committee will be established to "assist" the so-called "Indian Relief Committee for Tibetan Refugees" organized by Kripalani, the head of the Indian Praja Socialist Party.

Today's "Daily Sun" published a huge advertisement about this "Association" holding a public meeting in Colombo on May 31.

This advertisement, occupying about half a page, features a large portrait of the Dalai Lama and a title: "Mass Meeting of Monks and Laity to Discuss Countermeasures to be Taken Against the Communist Army's Massive Annihilation of Tibetan Monks." The advertisement claims that the purpose of the meeting is to: discuss the damage caused by Communist China's "aggression" to the Panchsheel policy, and express public opinion on Prime Minister Bandaranaike's speech in Parliament on the Tibetan issue.

The advertisement announced that the "agenda" of the meeting includes items such as: a report from the delegation's meeting with the Dalai Lama, discussing how to "assist" the Dalai Lama in protecting Buddhism from communist encroachment; declaring Buddhist public opinion against the "destruction" of Tibetan Buddhism; and discussing Kripalani's appeal for aid to Tibetan "refugees."

The advertisement also published topics invented by the organizers of the meeting according to their subjective wishes for further discussion at the meeting, attempting to force attendees to cheer them on and support them. These rumor-mongering topics include "Monks from Tibetan monasteries are exiled to Chinese military camps," "Chinese troops ruthlessly killed thousands of innocent Buddhists and children," "Two thousand five hundred out of three thousand monasteries in Tibet have been completely or partially destroyed, leaving eight thousand lamas displaced," and "Tibetans carrying portraits of the Dalai Lama are shot," etc.

    锡兰“佛教僧侣协会”
    阴谋策动反华运动
    新华社科伦坡21日电　据锡兰“每日新闻”20日报道，西藏叛乱事件发生后，在亲西方的统一国民党积极策动和支持下匆忙组织起来的锡兰“佛教僧侣协会”，最近正在阴谋发动一个所谓“抵制中国的运动”。
    消息说，这个“协会”将在本月31日召开一个公众集会，由统一国民党著名的支持者、这个反动协会的组织者和头子格纳尼萨拉和尚提出一个所谓他们在穆索里同达赖喇嘛会谈的报告，来策动一个反华运动。消息还说，这个协会将“号召一切佛教国家不要同中国贸易”，将成立一个有其它佛教国家“代表”参加的委员会来“组织对中国的抵制的运动”，此外还将成立另一个委员会，来“协助”印度人民社会党头子克里帕拉尼组织的所谓“印度救济西藏难民委员会”。
    今天的“每日太阳报”刊登了关于这个“协会”将在5月31日在科伦坡举行公众大会的巨幅广告。
    在这则约占半页篇幅的广告上，有一大幅达赖喇嘛的肖像，还有一个标题：“讨论对共军大事消灭西藏僧众应采取何种对策的僧俗群众大会”。这则广告宣称，大会的目的有：讨论共产党中国“侵略”对潘查希拉政策所造成的损害，表示公众对班达拉奈克总理在议会中关于西藏问题发言的意见。
    广告宣布，大会的“议程”包括这样一些项目：代表团同达赖喇嘛会谈的报告，讨论如何“援助”达赖喇嘛以保护佛教免受共产主义的侵害；宣布佛教徒舆论反对“摧残”西藏佛教；讨论克里帕拉尼要求援助西藏“难民”的呼吁。
    这则广告还刊登了这个大会的组织者按其主观愿望出的题目让大会进一步讨论，妄图强迫与会者为其摇旗呐喊助威。这些造谣惑众的题目有“西藏寺院的僧侣被放逐到中国的军营中”、“中国军队残酷无情地杀戮数以千计的无辜的佛教徒和儿童”、“西藏三千所寺院中有二千五百所完全或部分被破坏从而使八千喇嘛流离失所”、“带达赖喇嘛像片的西藏人遭到枪杀”等等。
