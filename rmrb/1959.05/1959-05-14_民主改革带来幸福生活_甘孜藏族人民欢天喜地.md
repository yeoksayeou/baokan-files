Democratic Reform Brings a Happy Life
Ganzi Tibetan People Rejoice

The Tibetan people of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, who have completed democratic reforms, are living a new life that they have dreamed of for generations. The vast number of poor farmers and herdsmen have been allocated land, houses, cattle, and sheep. Some areas have achieved cooperativization and established the first batch of people's communes.

The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province was formerly the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. It was established in 1950 and was one of the earliest Tibetan autonomous prefectures at the prefectural level in China. The prefecture covers an area of 220,000 square kilometers and has a population of about 400,000.

In the summer of 1955, Tibetan traitors Sokang Wangqing Geller, Chijiang Luosang Yexi, and others, after accompanying the Dalai Lama to the National People's Congress and returning to Tibet via Sichuan, incited and directed local upper-class reactionaries, serf owners, and feudal lords to rebel ("Kamba" rebellion) along the way. The rebels burned, killed, looted, and committed all kinds of evils. The vast number of Tibetan working people, in order to protect their lives and property, cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion in a short period of time, and in the spring of 1957, they successfully completed the democratic reforms, overthrowing the serf system that had long oppressed them.

After the liberated Tibetan farmers were organized, they broke with old customs and superstitions. To ensure this year's Great Leap Forward, farmers in various places also launched a deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation campaign. Bu Luo (first person), the head of Waze Township in Kangding County, personally led the members to climb the mountains to dig grass roots to accumulate fertilizer. Now the average fertilizer accumulation per mu has reached 30,000 jin.

After the democratic reforms, the Tibetan people, who are good at singing and dancing, composed many new songs to praise the Party and Chairman Mao. This is the "Xianzi Dance of Our Cooperative Has Set Up a Fertilizer Factory" being danced by members of the Yingguan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kangding County.

After the democratic reforms, the lives of the Tibetan people improved, and the number of poor children attending school has also increased several times. In 1958, the number of children enrolled in the prefecture accounted for 60% of school-age children. Mu Gu (left) and Ke ＠ (right), who had no opportunity to go to school in the past, can now also sit in the classroom and study.

In order to protect the health of the Tibetan people, medical and health units have been established in counties, districts, and townships throughout the autonomous prefecture after the democratic reforms. This is Pan Jingsheng, a doctor traveling to Juli Sai in Waze Township, Kangding County, giving medical treatment to the Tibetan people.

    民主改革带来幸福生活
    甘孜藏族人民欢天喜地
    已经完成民主改革的四川省甘孜藏族自治州的藏族人民正在过着世世代代梦寐以求的新生活。广大的贫苦农牧民分得了土地、房屋和牛羊，有的地区实现了合作化并建立了第一批人民公社。
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州原为西康藏族自治州。在1950年建立，是中国最早成立的一个专区级的藏族自治州。全州面积二十二万平方公里，人口四十万人左右。
    1955年夏天，西藏叛国分子索康·旺清格勒、赤江·罗桑益西等随达赖喇嘛出席全国人民代表大会完毕返藏道经四川时，沿途煽动和指使当地的上层反动分子、农奴主、封建主进行叛乱（即“康巴”叛乱）。叛乱分子到处烧杀抢掠，无所不为。当地广大藏族劳动人民，为了保护自己的生命财产，配合人民解放军，短期内就彻底平息了叛乱，并在1957年春天胜利完成了民主改革，推翻了长期以来压在他们身上的农奴制度。

    解放了的藏族农民在组织起来以后，破除陈规陋习和迷信思想，为保证今年大跃进，各地农民也掀起了深耕和积肥造肥运动。康定县瓦泽乡乡长布洛（前一人）亲自带领社员上山挖草根积肥，现在每亩平均积肥已达三万斤
    能歌善舞的藏族人民，在民主改革后，新编了很多歌曲来颂扬党和毛主席。这是康定县营官农业生产合作社的社员在跳“我们社里已办起了肥料工厂”的弦子舞
    民主改革以后，藏族人民生活改善了，入校读书的贫苦儿童也成倍地增加。1958年全州入学儿童占学龄儿童的60％。这是过去没有上学机会的木谷（左）和克＠（右），现在也能坐在教室里念书了
    为了保护藏族人民的身体健康，民主改革后，在自治州内的县、区、乡普遍建立了医疗卫生单位。这是巡回至康定县瓦泽乡居里塞的医生潘景升，正在为藏民看病
