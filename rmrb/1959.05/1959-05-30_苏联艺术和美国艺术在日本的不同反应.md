Different Reactions in Japan to Soviet and American Art

A recent article in the Japanese "Mainichi Weekly" reviewed the visits and performances of foreign artists and art groups to Japan in 1958. During that year, a total of forty-one groups visited Japan, including opera companies, dance troupes, ballet companies, theater groups, symphony orchestras, circuses, and world-renowned musicians. By country, the most frequent visitors to Japan last year were from the Soviet Union and France, with eight each, followed by the United States with four, and Britain and Italy with three each. China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and others each sent one group. The article stated that the most sensational was the Moscow Art Theater, which was the largest in scale, content, and impact. In terms of box office success, the Soviet Grand Circus led the way, attracting 500,000 spectators over three months. The article estimated that the Japanese inviting organization, the "Japan Art Friendship Association," would have a revenue of no less than 100 million yen. In contrast, the situation of the American New York City Ballet was quite dismal. According to publicly available materials, the company not only failed to earn a single yen during its performances in Japan but also suffered a loss of 6 million yen.

According to the article, the American Denishawn Ballet, which rushed to Japan in 1957 to compete with the Soviet Bolshoi Ballet after hearing news of their planned visit, attracted less than 50% of paying audience members during its full month of public performances. In contrast, the subsequent visit of the Soviet Bolshoi Ballet was a great success, attracting 60,000 spectators in twenty performances. Similarly, the New York City Ballet, which was considered a "treasure" by the United States, competed against the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, which has the highest international standing, at the Osaka International Arts Festival, and the competition ended with a Soviet victory. The Mainichi Weekly stated that the Soviet art envoys not only won the cultural war with the United States but also played a positive role in strengthening Japanese-Soviet friendship.

    苏联艺术和美国艺术在日本的不同反应
    日本“每日周刊”不久前载文回顾了1958年外国艺术家和艺术团体到日本访问演出的情况。这一年中到日本访问演出的共有四十一起，有歌剧团、歌舞团、芭蕾舞团、话剧团、交响乐团、马戏团以及世界著名的音乐家。按国家来说，去年到日本的最多的是苏联和法国，各有八起，其次是美国四起，英国和意大利各三起，中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度等各一起，文章说，最轰动的是莫斯科艺术剧院，它的规模、内容、影响也最大。从营业成绩来看，苏联大马戏团是一马当先，演出三个月，观众达五十万人；该文估计日方邀请单位“日本艺术友好协会”的营业收入将不下一亿日元。相比之下，美国纽约市芭蕾舞剧团的情况则甚为凄惨，据公开发表的材料，该团在日本演出期间不但没有赚得分文，而且亏损了六百万日元。
    据该文称，1957年听到苏联大剧院芭蕾舞剧团决定访日的消息，急急忙忙赶到日本想与之对抗的美国丹妮洛娃芭蕾舞剧团，在公演的整整一个月中，正式购票入场的观众还不到50％，而随之而来的苏联大剧院芭蕾舞剧团却获得了极大成功，演出二十场观众即达六万人。同样，后来对美国说来如同“宝贝”的纽约市芭蕾舞剧团，和具有最高国际水平的列宁格勒交响乐团，在大阪国际艺术节中的演出比赛，仍以苏联获胜而结束。每日周刊说，苏联艺术使节不仅在同美国的文化战中获胜，并且在加强日苏友好方面起了良好的作用。
