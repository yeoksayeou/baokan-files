Chongqing, May 19th (Our Dispatch) — Many workshops in the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory are mobilizing the masses to establish and improve rules and regulations to ensure a double leap forward in product quality and output.

Since March of this year, many workshops in the Construction Machine Tool Factory have established product quality inspection systems. The product quality inspection system in the 32nd workshop stipulates that products from each team must be inspected and qualified by the team leader and the team technician before being handed over to the next process. In addition to strengthening product inspection to ensure product quality, the Construction Machine Tool Factory also promotes the improvement of product quality by establishing sound and reasonable rules and regulations. Last winter, the 36th workshop, while undertaking the task of manufacturing generators, failed to establish the necessary technological procedures, resulting in poor quality of product parts. Accordingly, when the workshop recently accepted the task of manufacturing a new product – a winch – it first mobilized the workshop's technical personnel and workers to carefully study and formulate reasonable technological procedures, to standardize the quality specifications of various product parts, and to ensure that the products meet the requirements of the technical data.

After the establishment of reasonable rules and regulations in many workshops of the Construction Machine Tool Factory, product quality has generally improved. After the 32nd workshop established and improved a series of inspection systems in February, the rework and scrap rate of major products dropped from 11.8% in January of this year to 2% in March. The pass rate of other products has reached over 99%. The pass rate of the main product of the 22nd workshop – precision castings – has reached about 85% as a result of trial production according to the new technological procedures, while it was only 60% in January. Secondly, due to the establishment of some rules and regulations suitable for production needs, the management and production levels of many workshops have been further improved. After the implementation of the "Three Fixes" (fixed quotas, fixed manpower, and fixed tools) in the 36th workshop, not only is the management work orderly, but the workers are also able to study and reform technology very well, which greatly improves production efficiency. At present, the shift output of many parts and components of the winch, such as the spindle, base, gears, and bearings, has increased by more than three to five times compared with before the implementation of the "Three Fixes".

### 健全规章严格检查  重庆建设机床厂产品质量逐步提高

    健全规章严格检查
    重庆建设机床厂产品质量逐步提高
    本报重庆19日电　重庆建设机床厂许多车间正在发动群众建立健全规章制度，以保证产品质量产量双跃进。
    建设机床厂从今年3月份以来，许多车间就纷纷建立了产品质量的检验制度。三十二车间产品质量检验制度规定：各组的产品，要由组长和小组技术员检验合格以后，再交到下一道工序去。建设机床厂除了加强产品检验保证产品质量外，还通过健全合理的规章制度来推动产品质量的提高。这个厂的三十六车间，去年冬季在担负发电机制造任务当中，由于没有建立必要的工艺规程，致使产品零件质量不高。据此，这个车间在最近接受制造新产品——卷扬机的任务时，首先就发动车间技术人员和工人，认真研究并制定了合理的工艺规程，做到各种产品零件的质量规格化，使产品符合技术资料的要求。
    建设机床厂许多车间建立了合理的规章制度以后，产品质量普遍提高。三十二车间2月份建立与健全了一系列的检查制度后，主要产品的返工报废率由今年1月份的11.8％降低到3月份的2％。其他产品的合格率都达到99％以上。二十二车间的主要产品——精密铸造件，按照新的工艺规程试制的结果，现在的合格率已达到85％左右，而1月份只能达到60％。其次，由于一些适合生产需要的规章制度的建立，不少车间的管理水平和生产水平都有了进一步提高。三十六车间实行“三定”后，不但在管理工作上已经有条不紊，工人们也能够很好地钻研和改革技术，使生产效率大大提高。现在，卷扬机的轴心、底座、齿轮、轴承等许多零件部件的班产量，都比实行“三定”以前提高了三倍多到五倍以上。
