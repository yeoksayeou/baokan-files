Writing a Good "Synopsis" for a Novel

Most readers of novels are young students, workers, and cadres. Due to differences in time, education, and interests, many of them cannot read lengthy articles or book reviews. Therefore, it is very convenient to first have a general understanding of certain works in order to choose what to buy, and this is aided by the "synopsis" (or content description) in front of the book. In the past, most published novels did not have a "synopsis," but recently, especially some novels published in 1958, have included synopses, which has brought great convenience to readers, and some are well-written and very popular.

Among the novels published last year, I think the most outstanding "synopsis" is that of "Bitter Vegetable Flowers." In a short introduction of more than 500 words, it comprehensively, clearly, vividly, and concisely introduced the characteristics of the novel. In introducing the historical background and theme, it only used less than 60 words to make it perfectly clear. When introducing the main plot, it was written like this: "Insidious betrayals, vicious traps, crazy massacres, and the people's resolute resistance." In these short sentences, those vivid plots are summarized. The introduction of the characters is especially well written: "Among them, there are couples who suffer together and remain unyielding until death, rural women who, under the enemy's knives, would rather sacrifice their husbands to save the Eighth Route Army cadres, and intelligent and brave young students who are killed by their traitorous fathers for upholding the resistance against Japan..." "And running through the entire book is an ordinary yet great mother. The author focuses on portraying her noble temperament, kind virtues, and unwavering heroic character." In these few words, almost all the main characters and their character traits are clearly introduced, and the characterization is well summarized, with refined language.

Since the "synopsis" of a novel has an important role in allowing readers to have a general understanding of the work, thereby helping readers choose and understand the work, the publishing house should continue to attach importance to this work and make it even better.

In my opinion, a good "synopsis" should be a short but excellent "book review" of the book. It must briefly and vividly introduce the story content, historical background, theme, main plot, character characteristics, and artistic features of the book in a short article of a few hundred words. Of course, it is not easy to introduce such complex content in a short article of a few hundred words. This requires the person writing the "synopsis" to be familiar with the work, grasp the characteristics of the work, have a high degree of summarizing ability, and use the most concise language to write the "synopsis" vividly.

### 写好长篇小说的“内容提要”

    写好长篇小说的“内容提要”
    长篇小说的读者，大多数是青年学生、工人、干部。由于时间、文化程度、兴趣等不同，其中很多人不能阅读长篇论文或书评。那么，要首先对某些作品有一个轮廓的了解，才能选择买什么。这借助于书前的“内容提要”（或内容说明）是很便利的。以往出版的小说大多没有“内容提要”，最近，特别是1958年出版的一些长篇小说都有了内容提要，这给读者带来很大方便，而且有的写得很好，颇受读者欢迎。
    去年出版的几部长篇小说，我以为写得最出色的要算“苦菜花”的“内容提要”了。它在简短的五百多字的介绍里，全面、清楚、生动活泼、扼要地介绍了这部小说的特点。在介绍时代背景、主题思想时只用了不到六十个字，就介绍得一清二白。在介绍主要情节时是这样写的：“阴险的告密、毒辣的陷害、疯狂的屠杀、和人民坚决的抵抗”。在这简短的几句话里把那些生动的情节都概括进去了。在介绍人物时尤其写得好：“这当中，有双双受难、至死不屈的夫妻，有在敌人的刀口下，宁愿牺牲自己的丈夫，却挽救八路军干部的农村妇女，有为了坚持抗日而被自己的汉奸父亲杀死的、聪明勇敢的青年学生……。”“而贯串全书的，是一位平凡而伟大的母亲。作者着重刻划了她的崇高的气质，善良的品德和坚贞不屈的英雄性格。”在这短短的文字里几乎把主要人物及其性格特征都清清楚楚地介绍出来了，对人物性格概括得很好，语言精炼。
    长篇小说的“内容提要”既然有让读者对作品有一个轮廓的了解，从而帮助读者选择作品，理解作品的重要作用，出版社应当继续重视这一工作，使这一工作做得更好。
    我以为好的“内容提要”应当是该书的简短的然而却是优秀的“书评”。必须在几百字的短文里扼要地生动地介绍作品的故事内容、时代背景、主题思想、主要情节、人物性格特征及该书的艺术特色。当然在几百字的短文里要介绍这样复杂的内容是不容易的。这就需要写“内容提要”的人熟悉作品，掌握作品的特点，要有高度的概括能力，用最精炼的语言，生动活泼地写出“提要”来。
