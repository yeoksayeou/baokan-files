Some Experiences of Participating in Studies at the Socialist Academy
Speech by Committee Member Yu Zitan

Chairman, esteemed leaders, fellow committee members:

Over the past few days, after listening to the reports from Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, I have countless thoughts and feelings! As a woman who lived in the old society for decades, I feel infinitely excited, thrilled, and honored to have the opportunity to attend the highest meeting of the nation. Looking at today and thinking about the past, the difference is worlds apart. In the old society, it was already very fortunate for a woman to have the chance to learn a few characters. If she wanted to read more books and learn some skills, there were many obstacles. This was the case for me in my childhood. In order to study, I suffered discrimination and ridicule from my family and society. I will never forget the phrase "What's the use of women reading books?"

What about the young women of today? In the ten years since liberation, women have served as Vice Chairpersons of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, ministers in various ministries, and even scientists in the highest state power organ. Today, another woman has been elected as Vice President of the country. This makes us feel that the people living in the great Mao Zedong era are happier and more glorious than women living in any era in Chinese history.

Although I love my country and feel proud to see the leap-forward in our country's economic construction, and I am determined to learn from the worker and peasant comrades who have created many miracles, I still cannot seem to make a leap forward myself, and I often feel troubled by this. I often wonder why I cannot make a leap forward. At this time (October 1956), I was approved to participate in studies at the Socialist Academy founded by the CPPCC. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report to the committee members on some of my experiences studying at the Socialist Academy.

My first experience is: A correct self-awareness is an important prerequisite for the ideological remolding of old intellectuals. Recalling my ideological state before I came to the Socialist Academy two and a half years ago, I was satisfied that I had safely passed through all the previous political movements since liberation. I believed that I had never resisted the path of socialism, so what problems could there be with my political stance? What I lacked was Marxist-Leninist theory. As long as I made up for this, other problems could be easily solved.

However, after studying at the Socialist Academy for a period of time, and after the heart-to-heart talk movement during the rectification campaign, many selfish and self-interested personal plans hidden deep in my soul were exposed. For example, I superficially accepted the leadership of the Party comrades who directly led me, but I was not convinced in my heart, so I could never get along well with the leaders. In terms of work, if I was assigned too many tasks, I emphasized that I could not complete them, and if I was assigned too few, I said that I was not being used properly. I became a technical cadre who was difficult to arrange! These dirty thoughts were exposed with the earnest teachings of the academy and the help of my classmates, and were analyzed and criticized, thereby improving my ideological understanding. It also became clear to me the main reasons why I had not made progress or had made slow progress in recent years: it was not that the organization did not help me enough, but that I had a resistant attitude towards the leadership of the Party and lacked a sincere desire to actively demand ideological remolding.

My second experience is: The question of who to serve must be clarified. This was a problem that took me a long time to resolve. On the surface, I paid great attention to political study and actively participated in it, but deep down I always felt that it would be more beneficial to the people's cause to study more technical knowledge. When I encountered things like elections, I felt troubled, and sometimes even yearned for the mistaken idea that I could freely get by in the old society without participating in politics. After more than two years of studying at the Socialist Academy, I began to understand that due to the limitations of a selfish and individualistic outlook on life, it was impossible for old intellectuals to continue to rapidly advance in improving their professional knowledge. Conversely, if one is thoroughly transformed into a proletarian outlook on life, the goal of one's struggle is no longer a matter of one person, but a matter of the collective cause of the broad masses of working people, and one will always feel that one's knowledge is insufficient, which will generate a great impetus to push us forward. From this, it can be seen how important politics, which plays a commanding role, is to a revolutionary technical worker.

My third experience is: Only by mastering criticism and self-criticism is it possible to accelerate self-transformation. I usually had serious subjective and one-sided views on problems. Due to the influence of subjectivity and one-sidedness, I was very afraid of being criticized by others, and even more lacked the courage and unwillingness to conduct self-criticism. This was also one of the important reasons for my slow ideological transformation. After I arrived at the Socialist Academy, under the guidance of the academy leaders and with the help of my classmates, my ideological understanding and political theoretical level gradually improved. Through the anti-Rightist and rectification movements, criticism and self-criticism naturally and gradually unfolded throughout the academy. In the study of the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning the People's Communes" and the general line, criticism and self-criticism were continuously carried out in group meetings, so that I fundamentally understood the benefits of criticism and self-criticism and gradually developed to the point where I did not feel nervous about criticisms of others that were not quite appropriate, and even did not suffer from insomnia at night. Old intellectuals need to go through a process to learn to master criticism and self-criticism. Taking myself as an example, I went through five stages: at first, I was afraid of criticism, then I was afraid of sharp criticism, then I was afraid of incorrect criticism. The fourth stage was to gradually refrain from rushing to explain incorrect criticisms, and finally, I reached the point where I could basically treat any criticism with a welcoming attitude, no matter how the other party criticized me. As for self-criticism, I believe that regularly conducting ideological self-examination, recognizing one's shortcomings, correcting them, and actively and consciously seeking the help of the masses is very beneficial to ideological transformation. However, I have not done this enough.

My fourth experience is: Regarding productive labor at the Socialist Academy. Although the academy arranged productive labor courses in accordance with the Party's educational policy of combining productive labor with education, neither from the age of the students nor from the specific arrangements of the academy was it the same as the productive labor of general schools, nor was it the same as the productive labor of general office cadres. Instead, it flexibly utilized diverse organizational forms based on the students' different ages and physical conditions, on the basis of the students' willingness. For example, students who were older, sick, or physically weak were advised not to participate or to participate in a visiting capacity. Students who participated in productive labor were divided into three different groups according to their specific circumstances: one group for lighter labor, one group for general labor, and another group for those who were called young and strong to participate in slightly heavier labor. The number of labor sessions varied from two to four times a week in spring and autumn. In winter and summer, the academy basically did not arrange labor courses, considering the characteristics of the students. The overall arrangement of productive labor at the Socialist Academy was roughly like this, but it was inevitable that a small number of students would be unwilling to abide by the principles stipulated by the academy. For example, the academy believed that they were not suitable for participating in labor, but they personally firmly disagreed. There were also some older students who rushed to carry more during labor, and the academy cadres' persuasion was ineffective. In short, I feel that since the Party's new educational policy was put forward, everyone has realized the benefits of participating in productive labor in the past year, especially those who have personally participated in it have felt that participating in labor is very beneficial. Some older students have said that they feel relaxed and refreshed after regularly engaging in some physical labor. From my personal experience, this is indeed the case. Because the nature of the Socialist Academy is different from that of general schools, after the Party's new educational policy was put forward, some students doubted whether the Socialist Academy could implement this policy. However, practice has proven that the Socialist Academy is fully capable of implementing it.

Through my own personal feeling of having been away from my job for more than two years to study exclusively, I believe that for the ideological remolding of older intellectuals, if we can adopt a study method that combines full-time study of political theory away from work with on-the-job decentralized study of political theory, the effect will be greater and faster than simply using the latter method.

Finally, I feel extremely indignant at the provocative acts of the imperialists and Indian expansionists who support the Tibetan rebellion, unreasonably interfere in our country's internal affairs, and insult our country's leaders! The people of China's fifty-plus ethnic groups (including the Tibetan people) are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party, forming a huge and invincible force. If the imperialists and Indian expansionists dare to continue to disregard the solemn warnings of the 650 million Chinese people, the result will be their own destruction.

I hope that the leaders and committee members will correct and criticize whether these experiences are correct.

### 参加社会主义学院学习的几点体会  于滋潭委员的发言

　　参加社会主义学院学习的几点体会
    于滋潭委员的发言主席、各位首长、各位委员：
    几日来，听了周总理，李富春、李先念二位副总理和彭真副委员长四位首长的报告，感想千万！作为一个曾经生活在旧社会数十年的妇女，今日能有机会列席国家最高的会议，确实感到无限激动、兴奋、荣幸。看看今天，想想过去，天壤之别。在旧社会妇女能有机会识几个字已是十分幸运的了，若想读更多的书，学点本领，阻碍重重。我在幼年时代就是如此。为了读书，受尽家庭和社会的歧视和讽刺。“妇女读书有何用”这句话是我永不会忘记的。
    今天的青年妇女是怎么样呢？在解放后的十年中从国家最高权力机构人大常委会副委员长、各部部长以及科学家都有妇女在担任。今天又有妇女当选为国家副主席。这就使我们感到生活在伟大的毛泽东时代的人民比生活在中国历史上任何一个时代的妇女都幸福、都光荣。
    虽然我热爱着祖国，看见祖国经济建设飞跃前进而感到骄傲，工农同志创造了许多奇迹我也有决心要向他们学习。可是想跃进，又跃进不起来，常常为此而苦闷，老想自己为什么不能跃进？正在此时（一九五六年十月），我被批准参加政协所创办的社会主义学院学习，今天我愿借此机会把我在社会主义学院学习的几点体会向各位委员作简单汇报。我的第一个体会是：正确地自我认识是旧知识分子思想改造的重要前提。回忆两年半以前，我还未到社会主义学院学习的思想情况，满足于解放几年来历次政治运动我都是平平安安地渡过的，认为对走社会主义道路的问题，也向来没有抵触，我的政治立场还有什么问题？我所缺乏的是马列主义理论。只要补上这一课，其他问题都可以迎刃而解了。
    但是，经过在社会主义学院一段学习后，又经过整风时的交心运动，许许多多隐藏在我的灵魂深处见不得人的自私自利的个人打算都暴露出来了。比如，对直接领导我的党员同志，表面上接受领导，而心中却不服，因而同领导的关系总搞不好；在工作方面，工作任务分配给我多了就强调完不成，分配少了又说对我使用不当，我成为一个难于安排的技术干部了！这些肮脏思想在学院的谆谆教导和同学的启发帮助下暴露出来了，并且得到分析和批判，从而提高了我的思想认识，也弄清楚了几年来自己为什么不进步或进步比较缓慢的主要原因，不是组织上对我帮助的不够，而是我对党的领导有抵触情绪，缺乏积极要求思想改造的真诚意愿。我的第二个体会是：为谁服务的问题必须明确。这个问题在我是很长时间未得到解决。表面上看来，我对政治学习是很重视的，并且也积极地参加，可是内心总感到不如多学习些技术知识对人民的事业利益大些。遇到选举一类的事情则感到麻烦，甚至有时还留恋在旧社会不参与政治也可以自由混过去的错误想法。经过社会主义学院两年多的学习，始明白旧知识分子由于有一个自私自利个人主义人生观的局限性，对于业务知识的提高就不可能继续不断地迅速前进。反之，如果彻底改造为一个无产阶级的人生观，其奋斗目标就不再是一个人的问题而是面向着广大劳动人民集体事业的问题，就会永远感到自己的知识不足而产生出一种极大的动力，推着我们前进。由此可见，政治是统帅的作用，对于一个革命的技术工作者来说是多么重要。
    我的第三个体会是：只有掌握了批评与自我批评才有可能加速自我改造。我平素对问题的看法上有严重的主观、片面性。由于主观、片面对我的影响，就非常怕别人批评，更没有勇气而且也不愿意进行自我批评。这也是使我思想改造缓慢的重要原因之一。我到了社会主义学院后，在学院领导的教导和同学们的帮助下，思想认识和政治理论水平逐渐有所提高，经过反右和整风运动，批评与自我批评在全学院范围内很自然地逐步开展起来了。又在关于人民公社若干问题的决议和总路线的学习，批评与自我批评在小组会里不断地进行，使我对批评与自我批评的好处从基本上理解逐步锻炼到对别人的批评有不够恰当之处，也不像起初那样感到紧张，甚至于夜间失眠。旧知识分子能学会掌握批评与自我批评是要有个过程的，就以我为例，就经过五关：起初怕批评，后来怕尖锐的批评，再后来怕不正确的批评，第四阶段是逐步对不正确的批评不急于解释，最后达到不管对方批评的如何，基本上都能以欢迎的态度对待。对于自我批评，我认为能够经常地对自己进行思想检查，认识自己的缺点，改正缺点，主动自觉地争取群众的帮助，对思想改造的好处是非常大的。但是对于这一点我做的很不够。
    我的第四个体会是：关于社会主义学院的生产劳动。学院虽然根据党的生产劳动与教育相结合的教育方针安排了生产劳动课目，可是不论从学员年龄或者是从学院的具体安排也好，既不同于一般学校的生产劳动，又不同于一般机关干部的生产劳动，而是根据学员们的不同年龄，不同身体情况，在学员自愿的基础上灵活地运用了多样化的组织形式。比如说：年纪大些的、身体有病和体质较弱的学员就劝告他们不参加或者作为参观性质的参加。参加生产劳动的学员又根据不同具体情况编为三类不同的小组，一类是轻微一些的劳动，一类是一般劳动，还有一类是人们称之为少壮的参加略较重些的劳动。劳动的次数，春秋二季每周有二到四次不等，冬夏两季学院考虑到学员们的特点基本上是不安排劳动课程的。社会主义学院对生产劳动整个的安排大体如此，但在学员中间也不可避免地会有少数人不愿遵照学院规定的原则，比如学院认为他不宜参加劳动，而他个人却坚决不同意，还有些年老的学员在劳动时抢着多背多抬，学院干部劝告也无效。总之，我觉得从党的新的教育方针提出后，一年来，大家对参加生产劳动的好处都有所认识，特别是亲自参加过的人都觉得参加劳动好处非常大，有些年老的学员曾这样说：能够经常地进行些体力劳动，全身轻松精神愉快。从我个人的亲身体会的确是如此。因为社会主义学院的性质与一般学校不同，在党的新教育方针提出后，曾有一部分学员怀疑社会主义学院能不能贯彻执行这一方针，但是，经过实践证实，社会主义学院是完全能够贯彻执行。
    通过我自己脱离工作岗位二年多专一学习的亲身感觉，认为对年纪大一些的旧知识分子的思想改造来说，如果能够采取脱离工作岗位专一学习政治理论同在职分散学习政治理论学习方法相结合的两条腿走路的学习方法，其效果会比单纯用后者的一种学习方法要大些，要快些。
    最后，我对帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子支持西藏叛乱、无理干涉我国内政、侮辱我国领袖的挑衅行为感到无比愤怒！中国五十多个民族（包括藏族在内）人民紧紧地团结在中国共产党的周围，形成一股巨大的、不可战胜的力量。如果帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子竟敢继续无视六亿五千万中国人民的严正警告，其结果必将身败名裂。
    以上这些体会是否正确，希望各位首长、各位委员指正、批评。
