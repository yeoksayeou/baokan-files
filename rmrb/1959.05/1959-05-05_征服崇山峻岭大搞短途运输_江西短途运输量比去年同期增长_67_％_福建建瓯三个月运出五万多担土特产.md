    Conquering Mountains and Valleys, Vigorously Developing Short-Distance Transportation
    Jiangxi's Short-Distance Transportation Volume Increased by 67% Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    Jian'ou, Fujian, Transported Over 50,000 Dan of Local Specialties in Three Months
    Nanchang Dispatch from this newspaper, 4th – Jiangxi Province has been adapting to local conditions and carrying out technological innovations in organizing short-distance transportation, overcoming the difficulties of inconvenient transportation in mountainous areas and improving transportation efficiency, thereby accelerating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
    From January to mid-April this year, the materials gathered through short-distance transportation reached more than 3 million tons, an increase of more than 67% compared with the short-distance transportation volume in the same period last year. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, Jiangxi Province has begun to innovate various folk transportation tools. On the water, it focused on innovating the propulsion devices, hull structures, and the utilization of natural wind and water power of wooden sailboats to adapt them to the needs of carrying more cargo, running faster, and navigating into shallow tributaries. For example, many semi-mechanized wooden pedal propulsion devices, such as water-turning boards, water-pounding boards, and propellers, have been created and promoted in various places, replacing the traditional methods of sculling, paddling, masts, sails, and punting poles, improving transportation efficiency by about 50%. For the utilization of natural wind and water power, many areas have adopted the method of "one boat with multiple sails" and created various "winch vehicles" and other tools to replace the heavy labor of tracking boats across shoals. Tonggu County was originally a mountainous area with no access to cars and no navigation due to the shallow riverbeds, and a large number of materials could not be collected and transported in time. Since August last year, after improving the hull structure, more than 70 boats and more than 50 rafts have penetrated into the county's tributaries, transporting a large number of materials from the water and changing the historical situation of traffic obstruction.
    On land, a widespread movement of "vehicle-ization" and ball bearing-ization was launched to replace human porterage with vehicles. In the "vehicle-ization" movement, a large number of wheelbarrows, two-wheeled carts, earthen trains, and cattle-drawn trains suitable for pushing in mountainous and hilly areas were manufactured. At the same time, the wooden wheel structure of the vehicles was greatly improved and ball bearings were installed to make them lighter to push and reduce driving resistance. After the Hongqi People's Commune in Xiushui County renovated the wooden wheel structure of the carts, the load capacity per person increased from more than 200 jin to more than 400 jin. After renovation, the vehicles throughout the province generally improved transportation efficiency by more than 100% and saved a large amount of labor.
    In addition, aerial cableways and slides were built in the high mountains and valleys, allowing materials from high mountains to be transported down in strings by boat-shaped loading tools on the cableway.
    Fuzhou Dispatch from this newspaper, 4th – Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, has been developing short-distance relay transportation by the entire population, which has greatly improved transportation efficiency.
    Jian'ou County is surrounded by mountains and valleys. Although it is rich in products, due to inconvenient transportation and the large volume of local specialties such as timber, moso bamboo, dried bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and native paper being transported out, they often could not be transported out in time. This spring, the production teams of the People's Commune in this county, while ensuring grain production, extracted a group of laborers to develop short-distance relay transportation.
    Short-distance relay transportation is to establish connecting points or transfer stations in the production teams and native specialty production areas along the route, according to the natural conditions and transportation needs of the area, for the transportation routes that originally required a large number of people to cross mountains and rivers for long distances. Each connecting point (or station) is four or five li to one or twenty li apart. The commune members gather a large number of materials to the highway line like a relay race. This is an advanced experience in improving the efficiency of cargo transportation under the current situation of inconvenient mountain transportation.
    In organizing short-distance relay transportation, each commune has established a short-distance transportation command with the Party Committee of the commune and the Party branch of the brigade as the core. According to the transportation tasks and the decentralized production of local specialties, they have adopted a combination of professional transportation teams and mass shock transportation methods. They have formed a professional relay transportation team with small merchants and commune members who have engaged in transportation in the mountainous areas to undertake longer-distance transportation tasks. During the peak season of cargo, they organize commune members to transport goods as soon as they arrive. According to statistics, in the recent three months, the county has transported more than 57,000 dan of various local specialties.

### 征服崇山峻岭大搞短途运输  江西短途运输量比去年同期增长67％  福建建瓯三个月运出五万多担土特产

    征服崇山峻岭大搞短途运输
    江西短途运输量比去年同期增长67％
    福建建瓯三个月运出五万多担土特产
    本报南昌4日电　江西省在组织短途运输中因地制宜大搞技术革新，征服了山区交通不便的困难，提高了运输效率，从而加速了城乡物资交流。
    从今年1月份到4月中旬，短途运输集结起来的物资已达三百余万吨，比去年同期短途运输量增长67％以上。从去年大跃进以来，江西省便着手对各种民间运输工具进行革新，在水上，着重对木帆船的推进装置、船型结构和利用自然风力、水力进行了革新，使之适应多装快跑和深入浅水支流行驶的需要。例如，各地创造和推广了许多半机械化的木质脚踏推进器，如翻水板、捣水板、螺旋桨等，代替了橹、桨、桅帆、撑篙等推进方法，提高运输效率50％左右。对于利用自然风力、水力，许多地区采用了“一船多帆”办法，创造了多种“绞滩车”等工具代替了拉纤过滩的笨重劳动。铜鼓县原来是个既不通汽车又因河床太浅不能通航的山区，大批物资不能及时集运出来。去年8月以来，经过改良船型后，七十多条船只、五十多连木排，深入到该县支流，把大批物资从水上源源调运了出来，改变了交通闭塞的历史状况。
    在陆地，广泛开展了车子化和滚珠轴承化运动，以车子代替人力肩挑。在车子化运动中，一面制造了大批适合山区、丘陵地区推运的独轮车、双轮板车、土火车、牛群列车；一面大力改良了车子的木轮结构，安装上了滚珠轴承，使之轻便易推，行驶阻力减小。修水县红旗人民公社对车子木轮结构进行革新后，一人一车载重量由二百余斤增加到四百余斤。全省经过革新的车子，一般都提高运输效率一倍以上，并且节省了大批劳力。
    此外，在崇山峻岭之间大闹空中索道、滑道建设，使高山物资通过索道上的船形装载工具，成串地由上向下滑运下来。
    本报福州4日电　福建省建瓯县全民大办短途接力运输，大大提高了运输效率。
    建瓯县境内崇山峻岭，物产虽然丰富，由于交通不便，加上外运木材、毛竹、笋干、香菇、土纸等土特产品运量大，往往不能及时运出来。今年春天，这个县人民公社的各个生产队在确保粮食生产的同时，抽出一批劳动力大办短途接力运输。
    短途接力运输，是将原来需要大批人马翻山越岭、长途跋涉的运输路线，按照地区的自然条件和运输的需要，在沿线有关的生产队和土特产产地，建立接运点或转运站，每个接运点（或站）相距四、五里路到一、二十里，社员们像接力赛跑似的把大批物资集运到公路沿线。这在目前山区交通不方便的情况下，是提高货物运输效率的一种先进经验。
    各公社在组织短途接力运输中，都以社党委和大队党支部为核心，建立了短途运输指挥部，根据运输任务和土特产品的产地分散等特点，采取专业运输队伍和群众突击运输相结合的办法，把山区原有小商贩和搞过运输的社员组成接力运输专业队伍，担负着里程较长的运输任务，在货源多的时节，组织社员作到有货即运、随到随运。据统计，全县在最近的三个月中，就运了各种土特产五万七千多担。湖北罗田县平湖公社利用竹排调运大批粮食支援“武钢”建设
