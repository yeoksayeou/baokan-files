    Commune Power Plant
    The first civil-run power plant in Zhelimumeng League, Inner Mongolia, was born in Qianjiadian Commune, Tongliao City. On the evening of "May Day," a 48-kilowatt generator, with the arrival of the holiday, began rotating in this commune. Its current, through the high-voltage lines erected by the workers, was sent to the commune's offices, factories, production teams, canteens, and residents' homes, making Qianjiadian Commune shine brightly during the holiday.

    公社发电厂
    内蒙古哲里木盟第一个民办发电厂在通辽市钱家店公社诞生了。“五一”节的晚上，四十八＠的发电机，随着节日的到来，在这个公社里旋转起来。它的电流通过工人们架设的高压线，送到公社所在地的机关、工厂、生产队、食堂和居民的住宅，使钱家店公社在节日里大放光明。  （王泉胜）
