Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC at the First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC.

I firmly support the Central People's Government's policies and measures taken against the armed rebellion of the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary elements. I resolutely oppose the heinous crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements in betraying the motherland and undermining unity. The conspiracy of imperialism and foreign reactionary elements to use the rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary elements to carry out interference and instigation is bound to go bankrupt completely. The Tibetan rebellion will surely be quickly quelled, and the Tibetan people will have ample opportunity to get rid of the shackles of the serf system and realize the aspirations of democratic autonomy and social progress.

Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: Due to the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, our country has established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. In the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, 1958, there was an unprecedented magnificent and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the history of our national economic development. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 created the general prerequisite for us to continue the Great Leap Forward in 1959. These especially fill my heart with extraordinary excitement and great encouragement! Now I would like to report to the conference some facts and observations that I personally witnessed during the inspection regarding this aspect. If there are any inappropriate points, please correct me, comrades.

　　In the past, no one could be seen for hundreds of miles, but now chimneys are everywhere.

Not long ago, I was honored to join other CPPCC members in inspecting some areas of Heilongjiang Province. As everyone knows, this is a province that was once called "Great Northern Wilderness." Indeed, in my past impressions, I always thought of it as a desolate place outside the Great Wall where people were exiled. Before liberation, I once passed through here. At many stations along the way, there were few people getting on or off the train. Looking out from the train window, it was even more vast and boundless, with no one to be seen for hundreds of miles. This scene is still fresh in my memory today. However, what I saw during this inspection was completely different from before. It is no longer the original "Great Northern Wilderness," but the thriving, prosperous, and beautiful Heilongjiang Province. Its historically inherited desolate appearance outside the Great Wall is gone forever. It has been built into one of China's important industrial bases centered on heavy industry and based on modern large-scale enterprises. Here, chimneys are everywhere, and there is a constant flow of traffic. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, it is advancing along the broad road of socialism-communism at a rapid pace.

In 1958, Heilongjiang Province, like the rest of the country, was a year of unprecedented Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, a year of profound changes in social organization, economy, culture, and people's mental outlook. In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party, both industry and agriculture have achieved tremendous and brilliant results. Heilongjiang Province, which was once considered "unarmed," has built a steel base after a year of hard work. In agriculture, sixteen counties and cities in the province have reached the target of 400 jin per mu of grain stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule, and have produced a large amount of vegetables to support fraternal provinces. According to the materials I know, in 1958, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province increased by 73 percent compared with 1957. Among them, the total industrial output value increased by 88 percent compared with 1957, and the total agricultural output value increased by 51 percent compared with 1957.

　　Workers and peasants are enthusiastic and support each other to promote production

During the inspection, what impressed me most was the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants and their fiery passion for production. Whether they are men, women, old or young, they all have a high degree of selfless labor spirit and an indomitable and strong will to overcome all difficulties! After breaking superstitions and liberating their minds, they have shown endless strength and wisdom. Their ideological awareness and labor attitude are very different from before. For example, the model workers and advanced people on the production front that I saw in the Harbin Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory and other factories never act as "hand-raisers" in the face of arduous and complex tasks, but always try their best to overcome all difficulties and outstandingly overfulfill the tasks assigned by the Party and the higher authorities.

Since the establishment of the People's Commune, the face of society has also undergone great changes. Whether in improving the political consciousness of the masses, promoting the Great Leap Forward in production, or further improving people's lives, the People's Commune has shown strong vitality and obvious superiority. During the inspection, what I realized more deeply was that after the establishment of the commune, the relationship between workers and peasants was closer and more united than in the past. Their enthusiasm for helping each other, supporting each other, and actively developing production is even greater than before. For example: After the establishment of the Qiqihar Tiefeng People's Commune, which is mainly based on the rolling stock factory, the factory found that the tractors of the former advanced cooperative had been out of repair for two years and could not be used. It helped repair them within two days and started production. The machine tool factory of the Longsha Commune, the steel plant of the Hongan Commune, and the factories of other communes are the same. Workers install electric lights and broadcast devices for farmers in their spare time, and water pumps in the factory are sent to the fields for irrigation when they are not needed, and so on.

The Youth Farm of Longsha Commune is composed of students who failed to enter higher education in 1956. Now these young people are not only able to operate agricultural machinery and carry out agricultural production, but also have established small factories of different types related to farmers' lives to carry out industrial production. Thus, it promotes the rapid development of industrial production.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, the policy of combining education with productive labor was generally implemented. For example, Qiqihar University is a part-work and part-study university. Students obtain a thorough combination of theory and practice through practical production labor in the Heavy Machinery Factory and Beigang. In addition to the Qiqihar University and several Red and Expert Universities, various forms of spare-time schools have also been established in factories, communes, management areas, and production brigades to gradually improve the cultural and scientific and technological level of workers and peasants, making workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers a unified "five-in-one."

　　Yesterday's housewives, today's factory owners

One of the prominent points of the People's Commune's change in the face of society is that housewives have been completely liberated. They are not only actively involved in socialist construction, but also can create many amazing miracles in a short period of time. Last October, in the above-mentioned Qiqihar Tiefeng People's Commune, more than 40 satellite factories were established around the central task of the rolling stock factory, and now they have been merged into more than 20, such as spring bearings, models, cement, sand turning, glass silk and other factories. The workers in these satellite factories are all more than 2,000 women who are family members of the rolling stock factory workers. Yesterday they were housewives who were revolving around the stove, and today they have become production experts and factory owners. Last winter (1958), in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, they and the students and cadres built a chimney as high as 55 meters. This is simply an unimaginable miracle in the past!

Here I also saw another amazing example, that is, the electrical repair factory started from scratch by five housewives including Li Liancheng. At the beginning of the factory's establishment in October last year, some people thought that their conditions were not sufficient and their strength was weak, and they showed insufficient confidence in them and were unwilling to ask them for repairs. Later, Gannan County was eager to modify a generator. Because the repair in a large factory required too long a waiting time, they had no choice but to send it to them. They worked day and night and quickly modified the generator successfully, and the quality of work was very good, thus changing customers' views on them. Later, the motor factory also gave them technical support. When the repairing materials were not enough, they also learned to use substitutes. By the end of March this year, the factory had undertaken the repair of more than 100 generators and accumulated a fund of more than 6,000 yuan. In the first quarter of 1959, they also overfulfilled the task and were rated as a red flag unit.

In Harbin City, I saw a three-story building called the Pioneer, which was built entirely by women from design to completion, except for one master craftsman. Insiders said after seeing it: The quality of this building is much better than another building built by male workers nearby. After visiting, a Soviet expert said: This is the first building in the world built entirely by women.

I am a woman who came from the old society. Seeing the happiness of women in the new China today, I cannot help but think of the various constraints, oppressions, and sufferings suffered by women in the old China. Today's women are exactly the same as men, with equal rights to education and work. Especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, women have further got rid of the shackles of housework and can dedicate all their energy to the country and the people, creating all kinds of amazing miracles. As a woman, I believe that thousands of women sisters across the country will definitely have the same understanding as me: the Communist Party is the great savior of the people of the whole country, and even more so the great benefactor of our women. Without the wise and correct leadership of the Party, we women would not have such happiness today.

Dulles of the United States slandered our People's Commune, saying that our People's Commune "destroyed the family" and made "women lose their happiness." This reactionary and extreme imperialist dared to impersonate the protector of our women. Isn't this an absurd joke!

I am also an intellectual engaged in education and scientific work. When I see the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of industry and agriculture, I often think that the role played by our intellectuals in this Great Leap Forward is still not enough. I always feel that our intellectuals are not as active, resolute, daring to think, and daring to act as workers and peasants, and lack the boiling enthusiasm and soaring energy of workers and peasants. This may be because we have been too deeply influenced by the old education and cannot completely break with the bourgeois world outlook in a short period of time; we cannot break the conservative idea of superstition of books and superstition of experts for a while. This inspection has given me profound education and inspiration. I think that if we intellectuals want to better play our role in socialist construction, we must better listen to the leadership of the Communist Party, conduct self-transformation in accordance with the six political criteria, study Marxism-Leninism theory, study Chairman Mao Zedong's works, learn the communist style of the working people, integrate with the working people, strengthen labor training, and strive to be a working-class intellectual who is both red and expert and deeply red and expert. I believe that the vast majority of intellectuals, as long as they work hard in this direction, will surely be able to achieve their goals. Premier Zhou Enlai's report and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun's and Li Xiannian's reports all illustrate the specific measures for continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959. In this decisive year, let us adhere to the Party's general line of construction, go all out, aim high, and make greater contributions to the glorious cause of socialist construction in our great motherland.

　　黑龙江城乡视察观感
    刘恩兰委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，以及李维汉副主席在政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议上所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。
    我坚决拥护中央人民政府对原西藏地方政府及上层反动分子武装叛乱所采取的方针和措施。坚决反对西藏上层反动分子背叛祖国破坏统一的滔天罪行。帝国主义和外国反动分子企图利用西藏上层反动分子的叛乱进行干涉和挑拨离间的阴谋，势必遭到彻底的破产，西藏叛乱定能迅速的平息，西藏人民将有充分的可能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望。
    周总理在报告中指出：由于第一个五年计划的完成，我国已经建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础，而在第二个五年计划的第一年，即一九五八年更出现了一个我国国民经济发展史上前所未有的宏伟的全面大跃进。一九五八年的大跃进又造成了我们一九五九年继续大跃进的总前提。这些尤其使我在心灵中感到异常的振奋和莫大的鼓舞！现在我想向大会汇报一下我个人在视察中所身感目击的有关这一方面的一些事实和观感，不当之处，请同志们加以指正。
    过去百里不见人烟  现在到处烟囱林立
    在不久以前，我很荣幸地同其他政协委员一起，视察了黑龙江省一些地区。大家都知道这是一个曾经被人称之为“北大荒”的省份。的确，在我过去的印象里，也总以为这是个塞外荒凉充军流放的地方。解放前，我有一次路过这里，沿途许多车站上，都没有几个人上下车，从车窗看出去更是，茫茫无际，百里不见人烟。这种情景，对我说来，直到今天还是记忆犹新的。但是，在这次视察中，我所见到的已经完全不是从前那样了，现在已经不是原来的“北大荒”，而是欣欣向荣的富饶美丽的黑龙江省了，它那历史遗留下来的塞外荒凉的面貌，是一去不复返了。它已经建成为我国以重工业为中心、以现代化大型企业为骨干的重要工业基地之一了。在这里到处烟囱林立，车水马龙，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，正以一日千里的步伐沿着社会主义——共产主义的康庄大道向前迈进。
    一九五八年，在黑龙江省和全国一样，是社会主义建设取得空前大跃进的一年，是社会组织、经济、文化和人们的精神面貌发生深刻变化的一年。过去一年中，在党的正确领导下，工农业方面，都获得了巨大的辉煌灿烂的成绩。过去曾被认为是“手无寸铁”的黑龙江省，经过一年的努力，已建成了钢铁基地；在农业方面，全省已有十六个县市提前九年达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食亩产四百斤的要求，并且生产了大量的蔬菜支援了兄弟省份。据我所知道的材料，一九五八年全省工农业总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之七十三。其中工业总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之八十八，农业总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之五十一。
    工农群众干劲冲天  互相支援促进生产
    在视察中，使我感受最深刻的是，工人和农民的冲天干劲和热火朝天的生产热情，他们不论是男女老幼，都具有高度的忘我的劳动精神和准备克服一切困难的大无畏的坚强意志！在破除迷信，解放思想以后，他们显示出了无穷无尽的力量和智慧，他们现在的思想意识和劳动态度都与从前大不相同了。例如，我在哈尔滨量具刃具厂和其它各厂所见到的劳模及生产战线上的先进者，在艰巨而复杂的任务面前，从不作“伸手派”，而总是千方百计地想尽一切方法，克服一切困难，出色的超额地完成党和上级所交给的任务。
    人民公社成立以后，社会的面貌也起了很大的变化，无论在提高群众政治觉悟，促进生产大跃进，进一步改进人民生活等方面，人民公社都显示了强大的生命力和明显的优越性。在视察中，使我体会更深的是，公社成立以后，工人和农民之间的关系比过去更加密切，更加团结了。他们之间的互相帮助，互相支援，积极发展生产的劲头，比以前更大了。例如：在以车辆厂为主的齐齐哈尔铁锋人民公社建立后，工厂发现过去高级社的拖拉机已失修两年不能用了。在两天内即帮助修理完毕，开始生产。龙沙公社的机床厂，红岸公社的钢厂和其他各社的工厂都是一样的，工人在工余时间就为农民安装电灯及广播器，厂内水泵在不需用时即送往田地中灌溉，等等。
    龙沙公社的青年农庄就是一九五六年未能升学的学生所组成的，现在这些青年不但能够操作农业机械，进行农业生产，而且还建立了与农民生活有关的不同类型的小型工厂，进行工业生产。从而促进了工业生产的飞跃发展。
    人民公社成立以后，普遍地贯彻执行了教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。如齐齐哈尔大学，就是半工半读的大学，学生通过在重型机厂和北钢进行实际生产劳动，获得了理论与实际的彻底结合，除半工半读的齐齐哈尔大学和几个红专大学外，各工厂各公社管理区及生产大队也都开办了各种形式的业余学校，逐渐的提高了工人和农民的文化和科学技术水平，使工、农、商、学、兵，成为一个统一的“五位一体”了。
    昨天的家庭妇女  今天的工厂主人
    人民公社使社会面貌改变的突出点之一是家庭妇女得到了彻底的解放，她们不但积极的投入了社会主义建设，而且能在很短的时间内创造出许多惊人的奇迹。去年十月间，在上面所说的齐齐哈尔铁锋人民公社，围绕着车辆厂的中心任务，建立了四十多个卫星厂，现在已经合并为二十多个，如弹簧轴承、模型、水泥、翻沙、玻璃丝等工厂，这些卫星厂内的工人都是车辆厂职工的家属二千多妇女，她们昨天还是围绕着锅台转的家庭妇女，今天已经成为生产能手和工厂的主人了。去年冬天（一九五八年）在零下三十多度的严寒下，她们和学生、干部在一起建成了高达五十五公尺的烟筒，这简直是过去不可梦想的奇迹！
    在这里我还看到另外一个令人惊奇的事例，就是李连成等五名家庭妇女白手起家的电机修配厂，在去年十月建厂初期有些人认为她们条件不够，力量薄弱，对她们表现信心不足，不愿找她们修理，后来，甘南县急于改装一部发电机，因为大厂修理需要等待的时间太长，不得已，才送到她们那里，而她们昼夜的干，竟把这部发电机很快地改装成功了，并且工作质量很好，从而改变了顾客对她们的看法，后来电机厂也给予她们技术上的支援。在修补材料不够的时候也学会了用代替品，到今年三月底这个工厂已经承修了一百多台发电机，积累了基金六千余元，一九五九年第一季度，她们还超额完成了任务，被评为红旗单位。
    在哈尔滨市我看到了一座从设计到落成，除一个老师傅外，全部由妇女建成的先锋号三层的大楼。内行的人看了说：这个楼比邻近另一个男工建成的楼质量上还要好得多。一位苏联专家参观以后说：这是世界第一座全部靠妇女建成的大楼。
    我是一个出身于旧社会的妇女，看到今天新中国妇女的幸福，就不禁会想到旧中国妇女们所受到的种种束缚、压迫和苦难。现在的妇女和男子完全一样，有同等受教育和获得工作的权利。特别是建立人民公社以后，妇女们更进一步摆脱了家务羁绊，能以全副精力献给国家和人民，创造出种种惊人的奇迹。作为一个妇女，我相信全国千千万万的妇女姐妹们一定都会和我有同样的认识：共产党是全国人民的大救星，更是我们妇女们的大恩人，没有党的英明正确的领导，我们妇女就不会有今天这样的幸福。
    美国的杜勒斯诬蔑我国人民公社，说我国人民公社是“破坏了家庭”，使“妇女失掉了幸福”，这个反动透顶的帝国主义分子，竟敢冒充我国妇女的保护人，岂不是荒谬绝伦的笑话吗！
    我又是个从事教育和科学工作的知识分子，当我看到工农业各方面的大跃进的时候，常常联想到我们知识分子在这大跃进中，所起的作用还很不够，总是感觉到我们知识分子不及工人农民那样的积极、坚决、敢想、敢干、缺乏工人农民的那种沸腾的热情和冲天的干劲，这可能是由于受旧教育的影响太深，不能在很短的期间彻底地同资产阶级的世界观决裂；不能一时打破迷信书本迷信专家的保守思想。这次视察，使我受到了深刻的教育和启发。我觉得我们知识分子，要想在社会主义建设中更好地发挥自己的作用，就必须更好地听从共产党的领导，根据六条政治标准，进行自我改造，学习马克思列宁主义理论；学习毛泽东主席的著作，学习劳动人民的共产主义风格，和劳动人民打成一片，加强劳动锻炼，争取作一个又红又专红透专深的工人阶级知识分子，我相信绝大多数的知识分子，只要向这个方向努力，一定能够达到目的的。周恩来总理和李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告，都说明一九五九年继续大跃进的具体措施。让我们在这决定性的一年中，为伟大的祖国在社会主义建设的光荣事业上，坚持党的建设总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游，作出更大的贡献。
