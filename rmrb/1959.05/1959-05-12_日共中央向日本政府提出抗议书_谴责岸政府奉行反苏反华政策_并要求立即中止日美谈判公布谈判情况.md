Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th dispatch: According to today's "Akahata" report, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party dispatched representatives to the Japanese government on the 9th to submit a protest, strongly protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's disregard for the people's wishes and its execution of policies hostile to socialist countries.

The protest first condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for continuing to hold negotiations with the United States regarding the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and demanded an immediate halt to the negotiations and the full disclosure of past negotiation details.

The protest pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party's published outline for revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" shows that after the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," U.S. forces will still retain the privilege of establishing military bases throughout Japan, Japan will remain subordinate to the United States, and the U.S.-Japan military alliance under U.S. control will be further strengthened. The protest pointed out that this outline also allows U.S. forces to openly interfere in Japan's internal affairs under the pretext of dealing with so-called "indirect aggression."

In the protest, the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an act of trampling on Japan's sovereignty and independence and undermining peace in Asia and the world.

The protest condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's decision to sign a compensation agreement with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The protest pointed out that Japan's compensation agreement with Vietnam should be signed with the government representing the entire Vietnamese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government's intention to sign a compensation agreement with the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique is to establish a bridgehead in South Vietnam for Japanese monopoly capital attempting to carry out economic aggression in Southeast Asia, and to assist U.S. imperialism in strengthening its aggressive base in South Vietnam.

The Japanese Communist Party condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for delaying and obstructing the early resolution of the issue of repatriating Korean residents in Japan to their homeland. The protest demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government urge the Japanese Red Cross Society to sign a fair agreement with the Korean Red Cross Society as soon as possible on the repatriation of Korean residents, so that Korean residents who wish to return home can return to Korea as soon as possible.

In the protest, the Japanese Communist Party strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's recent series of acts hostile to China. The protest pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's request for Japanese journalists visiting China to provide Chinese military intelligence shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government still adopts an undisguised policy of hostility towards China.

The protest also condemned Kishi Nobusuke's recent slander of China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as "aggression" against Tibet and interference in China's internal affairs.

The Japanese Communist Party protested against the Kishi Nobusuke government's execution of anti-Soviet policies. The protest pointed out that in recently published maps, the Kishi Nobusuke government included the Southern Kuril Islands, Soviet territory, into the Hokkaido administrative region of Japan, and also allocated funds in the national budget to subsidize the movement demanding the "recovery" of the southern half of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, which is a conspiracy to create disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union.

The protest said that these actions show that the Kishi Nobusuke government is assisting U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and wants to drag Japan back onto the old road of militarism and imperialism.

The protest pointed out that these actions of the Kishi Nobusuke government violate the Japanese people's desire for peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world, and are also despicable acts of sowing the seeds of international disputes.

    日共中央向日本政府提出抗议书
    谴责岸政府奉行反苏反华政策
    并要求立即中止日美谈判公布谈判情况
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党中央委员会9日派遣代表向日本政府提出抗议书，严重抗议岸信介政府忽视人民愿望，执行敌视社会主义各国的政策。
    抗议书首先谴责岸信介政府仍然继续同美国举行关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，并且要求立即停止谈判，把过去谈判的情况全部公开出来。
    抗议书指出，自由民主党发表的日美“安全条约”修改纲要表明，日美“安全条约”修改后，美军仍然保有在日本各地设置军事基地的特权，日本仍然处于从属于美国的状态，同时在美国控制下的美日军事同盟将进一步加强。抗议书指出，这项纲要还假借对付所谓“间接侵略”的名义，容许美军公然干涉日本内政。
    日本共产党在抗议书中指出，修改日美“安全条约”是蹂躏日本的主权和独立、破坏亚洲和世界和平的行为。
    抗议书谴责岸信介政府决定同吴庭艳集团签订赔偿协定。抗议书指出，日本对越南的赔偿协定应该同代表全体越南人民的政府签订，岸信介政府要同南越吴庭艳集团签订赔偿协定，目的是为企图对东南亚进行经济侵略的日本垄断资本在南越建立桥头堡，并协助美帝国主义加强在南越的侵略基地。
    日本共产党谴责岸信介政府拖延和阻挠早日解决遣送旅日朝侨回国问题。抗议书要求岸信介政府促使日本红十字会尽速同朝鲜红十字会签订公正的遣送朝侨的事务协定，使希望回国的朝侨能够尽速回到朝鲜。
    日本共产党在抗议书中强烈谴责岸信介政府最近一连串的敌视中国的行为。抗议书指出，岸信介政府要求到中国访问的日本新闻记者提供中国的军事情报，这表明岸信介政府对中国仍然采取露骨的敌视政策。
    抗议书还谴责岸信介最近诬蔑中国平息西藏叛乱是对西藏的“侵略”，干涉中国内政。
    日本共产党抗议岸信介政府执行反苏政策。抗议书指出，岸信介政府在最近出版的地图里把苏联领土南千岛群岛划入日本北海道行政区域，还在国家预算中拨出款项资助要求“收复”苏联领土库页岛南半部和千岛群岛的运动，这是企图在日苏两国间制造纠纷的阴谋。
    抗议书说，这些行为表明了，岸信介政府协助美帝国主义的侵略政策，要把日本重新拖上军国主义和帝国主义的老路。
    抗议书指出，岸信介政府的这些行为违背了日本人民要求同世界各国和平相处的愿望，同时也是撒播制造国际纠纷的种子的卑劣行为。（附图片）
