Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th - According to today's "Neues Deutschland" report, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, pointed out at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany that the two Germanys should sign a treaty of non-aggression. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Socialist Unity Party was held on the 22nd and 23rd. Ulbricht said that two weeks after the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, the political leaders of the two Germanys face the question: What efforts should the representatives of the two Germanys make in order to advance the policy of easing international tensions and promoting rapprochement between the two Germanys? Ulbricht continued that it would be beneficial for the two Germanys to conclude a treaty renouncing the use of force and stipulating the mutual obligation to resolve all issues peacefully, that is, to sign a treaty of non-aggression. We believe that government delegations from the two Germanys should meet in Geneva and hold negotiations on an equal basis on the conclusion of such a treaty.

Ulbricht said that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany is, and still is, the focus of attention at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. Unfortunately, the Western countries have not put forward any suggestions on the Soviet draft treaty. It is necessary for them to put forward their own suggestions or their own draft treaties.

Speaking about the so-called "package plan" put forward by the West, Ulbricht said: "This plan has an aggressive nature, which is unacceptable and cannot be a basis for serious discussion." Ulbricht continued that, however, there are some matters in this plan that can be the subject of discussion at the conference. For example, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany must be a matter for discussion at the conference. He further pointed out that this peace treaty must conform to the reality of the coexistence of the two Germanys and be signed with both Germanys.

Ulbricht compared the positions taken by the delegations of the two Germanys at the Geneva Conference. He said that the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic had made every effort at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference to ease international tensions and to express its position on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Its realistic proposals at the conference enhanced the prestige of our country. No one will doubt any longer that the German Democratic Republic has already received de facto recognition.

Ulbricht condemned the position of the Bonn government delegation at the conference, saying that the Bonn government was trying everything possible to obstruct any restrictions on German militarism and delay the reunification of Germany. He also condemned Adenauer's claim that West Germany's arms expansion and atomic armament had changed the balance of power, and pointed out that this was an illusion. Ulbricht said that West Germany's arms expansion cannot change the balance of power in Europe or the world, but can only make West Germany and West Berlin develop into dangerous hotbeds of war. The position taken by Western countries on the issue of German arms expansion is unrealistic. The balance of power in the world requires seeking an understanding based on reality.

    乌布利希再次提出促使两个德国接近的建议
    两个德国应当签订互不侵犯条约
    主张双方政府代表团在日内瓦谈判缔结条约的问题
    新华社柏林24日电  据“新德意志报”今天报道，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在德国统一社会党第五次中央全会上指出，两个德国应当签订互不侵犯条约。统一社会党五中全会是在22日和23日举行的。乌布利希说，日内瓦东西方外长会议举行两个星期之后，两个德国的政治领导人面临着这样的问题：两个德国的代表应该作出怎样的努力，以便推进缓和国际局势的政策和促使两个德国接近呢？乌布利希接着说，两个德国之间缔结一项摒弃使用武力、规定互相承担用和平方式来解决一切问题的义务的条约，即签订一项互不侵犯条约，是有益处的。我们相信，两个德国的政府代表团应当在日内瓦会面并在平等的基础上就缔结这样一个条约举行谈判。
    乌布利希说，苏联提出的对德和约草案是，而且现在仍然是日内瓦外长会议的注意中心，遗憾的是西方国家对苏联的和约草案没有提出任何建议，它们有必要提出自己的建议或自己的和约草案。
    在谈到西方提出的所谓“一揽子计划”时，乌布利希说：“这个计划具有侵略本质，这是不能被接受的，它也不能成为一个认真讨论的基础。”乌布利希接着说，但是，这个计划里有一些事项可以成为会议的讨论对象。譬如，缔结对德和约，当然要成为会议讨论的问题。他进一步指出，这个和约必须符合两个德国并存的现实情况，而同两个德国签订。
    乌布利希把两个德国的代表团在日内瓦会议上所采取的立场作了对比。他说，德意志民主共和国政府代表团在日内瓦外长会议上为缓和国际紧张局势和表明自己在缔结对德和约上的立场方面尽了一切努力。它在会议上的实事求是的主张提高了我们国家的威信。谁也不会再怀疑，德意志民主共和国已经得到事实上的承认了。
    乌布利希谴责波恩政府代表团在会议上的立场说，波恩政府是想尽一切办法阻挠对德国军国主义的任何限制和拖延重新统一德国。他还谴责了阿登纳扬言西德扩军和原子武装改变了力量对比的说法，并指出这是一种幻想。乌布利希说，西德的扩军并不能改变欧洲或世界上的力量对比，而只能使西德和西柏林发展成为危险的战争温床。西方国家在德国扩军问题上所采取的立场是不现实的。世界上的力量对比要求从现实基础出发，寻求一种谅解。
