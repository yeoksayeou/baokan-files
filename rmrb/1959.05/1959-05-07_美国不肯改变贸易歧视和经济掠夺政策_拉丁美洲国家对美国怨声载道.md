Xinhua News Agency, May 6th, Buenos Aires dispatch: The "Committee of Twenty-One" of the Americas conference held in the Argentine capital has entered its ninth day. The central topic of this meeting is to discuss the "economic development" issues of Latin America. At the meeting, the opinions of the US representatives differed from those of representatives of other countries. In order to narrow the differences, a "Measures to Promote Economic Development in Latin America" report was drafted by a "Fifteen-Nation Working Group" with US participation, as the basis for the general assembly's discussion. However, during the discussion process, many national representatives' speeches still fiercely criticized the United States' trade discrimination and economic plunder policies.

It is reported that Cuban Prime Minister Castro, when talking about the measures Latin American countries must take to improve their economic situation, said: "If we can freely sell all our goods, we can accumulate funds. If the United States removes all restrictions on the sale of our main products, and removes subsidies for those goods that compete with us, then we can sell all our products and obtain the necessary amount of foreign exchange and gold reserves to develop the country."

Castro criticized the United States for often trying to use US aid to exert economic and political pressure on other countries.

Salvadoran representative Martínez Moreno said that the establishment of the Inter-American Economic Development Bank "cannot solve, or even partially solve, the problem of raising the living standards of Latin American countries."

Mexican representative Hernández Delgado said: "In such an important region, it is not possible to obtain cooperation (from the United States) as quickly as one would like." He said: "We are talking about some increasingly serious problems in foreign trade." He condemned the US government's trade exclusionary policies such as fixing import quotas for lead and zinc, raising import taxes in this area, and subsidizing cotton exports. He said that this policy "deteriorates the Latin American economy."

Uruguayan representative Villaman criticized certain draft resolutions of the meeting as "vague" and intentionally delaying the resolution of issues that have been raised. He demanded that the resolutions must include some measures to prevent price fluctuations. He pointed out that Uruguay faced great difficulties in wool exports in 1958, and wool exports accounted for more than 60% of Uruguay's exports. At that time, the Soviet Union was the only buyer of Uruguayan wool for several months.

Chilean representative Gutiérrez Olivos said that it is necessary to "take measures to end the backwardness of Latin America." Brazilian representative Schmidt said that the purpose of the twenty-one nation conference is to "liberate many unfortunate regions in this hemisphere."

Local newspapers expressed dissatisfaction with the speech made by US representative Thomas Mann at the meeting. The Argentine newspaper "Razón" said that Thomas Mann's speech showed that the new responsible authorities of the US State Department do not want to fundamentally change relations with Latin American countries.

However, the "New York Times," mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, in a commentary on April 30, pointed fingers at the meeting, saying: "Latin American countries must understand that, due to the unpleasant realities of the world economy, they have to make greater efforts." This newspaper advised Latin American countries to "adjust the production of export goods according to the laws of supply and demand in the world market." The newspaper threatened that Latin American countries must "abandon the nationalism that leads to the rejection of foreign investment in resources such as oil."

　　美国不肯改变贸易歧视和经济掠夺政策
    拉丁美洲国家对美国怨声载道
    新华社6日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：在阿根廷首都举行的美洲“二十一国委员会”会议已进入第九天。这次会议的中心议题是讨论拉丁美洲的“经济发展”问题。在会议上，美国代表同其他国家的代表的意见发生了分歧。为了缩小分歧，曾由有美国参加的“十五国工作小组”草拟了一项“促进拉丁美洲经济发展的措施”的报告作为大会讨论的基础。但是在讨论过程中，许多国家代表的发言仍猛烈抨击美国的贸易歧视和经济掠夺政策。
    据报道，古巴总理卡斯特罗在谈到拉丁美洲国家为改善经济情况必须采取的措施时说：“如果我们能够自由地出售我们的一切商品，就可以积累资金。如果美国取消对我们主要产品销售的一切限制，取消对那些同我们竞争的商品的补助金，那么我们就能出售我们的一切产品，获得必要数量的外汇和黄金储备来发展国家。”
    卡斯特罗批评美国经常想利用美援对其他国家施加经济和政治压力。
    萨尔瓦多代表马尔蒂内斯·摩伦诺说，成立泛美经济开发银行“不能解决、甚至不能部分地解决提高拉丁美洲国家生活水平的问题”。
    墨西哥代表埃兰德斯·戴尔加多说：“在这样一个重要地区，却不可能如人所愿地尽快得到（来自美国方面的）合作。”他说：“我们说的是一些日益加剧的对外贸易方面的严重问题。”他谴责美国政府所采取的固定铅和锌的进口限额，提高这方面的进口税，给予棉花出口补贴等贸易排挤政策。他说，这种政策“使拉丁美洲经济恶化”。
    乌拉圭代表维利亚曼批评会议某些决议草案“含糊其词”，有意拖延已提出的问题的解决。他要求在决议中必须包含一些用以防止价格波动的措施。他指出，乌拉圭在1958年面临羊毛出口的巨大困难，而羊毛出口占乌拉圭出口额的60％以上。那时，好几个月中，苏联是乌拉圭羊毛的唯一买主。
    智利代表古蒂雷斯·奥利沃斯说，有必要“采取措施来结束拉丁美洲的落后状况”。巴西代表施密特说，二十一国会议的目的是要“解放这半球的许多处在不幸中的地区”。
    当地报纸对美国代表托马斯·曼在会上的发言表示不满。阿根廷报纸“理性报”说，托马斯·曼的发言表明美国国务院的新任负责当局不想从根本上改变和拉丁美洲国家的关系。
    但是美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”在4月30日的一篇评论中却对会议指手划脚地说道：“拉丁美洲国家必须了解，由于世界经济的令人不愉快的现实，它们得尽更大的努力。”这家报纸劝告拉丁美洲国家“根据世界市场的供需法则来调整出口货物的生产”。报纸威胁地说，拉丁美洲国家必须“放弃那种导致拒绝外国在如像石油这样的资源方面的投资的民族主义。”
