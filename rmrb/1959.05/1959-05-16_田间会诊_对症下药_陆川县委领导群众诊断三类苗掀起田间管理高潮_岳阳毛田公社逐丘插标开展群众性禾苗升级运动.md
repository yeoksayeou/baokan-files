Field Consultation, Prescribing the Right Remedy
    Leading the Masses in Diagnosing Three Types of Seedlings, the Lucuan County Party Committee Sets Off a High Tide of Field Management
    Maotian Commune in Yueyang Carries Out Mass Seedling Upgrading Movement by Planting Signs on Each Plot
    This newspaper Nanning dispatch on the 15th: It is difficult to get the right conclusion if you look at anything by only looking at its temporary or surface phenomena; it is the same with looking at seedlings. In the past, people often classified flourishing seedlings as first-class seedlings; however, this year, the farmers in Lucuan County classified some seedlings that were too vigorous, with leaves that were too long and wide, as third-class seedlings. This is because such seedlings are prone to early lodging, leading to a serious reduction in production, and attention must be paid to strengthening management as early as possible.
    In the early stage of early rice field management, the Lucuan County Party Committee led commune members to discuss the standards for third-class seedlings and the reasons for their formation. Everyone believed that there were many reasons for the formation of third-class seedlings, some congenital and some acquired, and the situation was very complex. The leading members of the Lucuan County Party Committee also went to the Luoluo Brigade of Qinghu Commune to humbly seek advice from the masses, and together with the masses, inspected the fields and held field consultations, gaining experience in applying fertilizer according to the seedlings and using water according to the seedlings. They determined six different management plans according to the different conditions of the seedlings. The first type was high-yield fields with congenital advantages and excessive vigor, which had excessive tillering and abnormal development, posing a danger of lodging. Therefore, it was decided to immediately drain the water and implement shallow irrigation, without applying additional fertilizer for the time being, and then apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer before the jointing stage. The second type was nursery fields, where the seedlings did not turn green for a long time after being transplanted and did not grow new roots, mainly due to insufficient base fertilizer and late transplanting. It was decided to apply a large amount of wood leaves as green manure, and then apply human manure or lime to promote early growth and rapid development. The third type was seedlings that had suffered from frost and were congenitally frustrated, and were yellow and old, and withered after being transplanted. For this type of seedling, it was decided to apply "four-flavor soup" (a mixed fertilizer of human urine, fire ash, chicken and duck manure, and saltpeter). The fourth type was mountain and valley cold water fields, which were covered with green and red duckweed, with soft stalks that did not tiller. Measures such as draining and sun-drying the fields and applying lime were taken to increase the soil temperature. The fifth type of seedlings turned yellow after being transplanted and did not grow new roots. It was decided to use fire ash to mix human urine and pour it with boiling water to quickly promote root growth. The sixth type was seedlings with poor root fertilizer and slow greening, and it was decided not to weed for the time being, but to irrigate the seedlings with water fertilizer to promote greening. After such a comprehensive assessment and specific treatment, all the third-class seedlings in the entire brigade were eliminated within six days.
    The County Party Committee firmly grasped this banner, convened an on-the-spot meeting, and created momentum to turn the experience of Luoluo Brigade into the experience of all parts of the county. The county's field management campaign suddenly set off a high tide. The county's 300,000 mu of early rice have now been cultivated three times, with 200 dan of additional fertilizer applied per mu; the amount of third-class seedlings has dropped from more than 90,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu, and most of the seedlings are neat and strong in every plot.
    Whether third-class seedlings can be upgraded quickly depends on the amount of fertilizer accumulated and whether the field management responsibility system is implemented at all levels. In the early stage of field management, all communes in Lucuan County drew a certain amount of manpower to launch a second fertilizer accumulation campaign. In terms of the field management responsibility system, proper arrangements were made from the leaders to the masses. The county's nine communes were divided into three areas: south, central, and north, with three county party secretaries and members assigned to lead the work, and the party secretaries and members of each commune were assigned to brigades, and the cadres of brigades and production teams were assigned to the fields, and commune members were responsible for the fields, so that every block had soldiers and every field had generals.
    According to the New Hunan Daily, Maotian Commune in Yueyang took measures such as field consultation, planting signs on each plot, setting up camps in the fields, and launching large-scale competitions to carry out a mass campaign to upgrade seedlings and eliminate third-class seedlings. Within five days, 6,347 mu of third-class seedlings in the entire commune had been upgraded to second-class seedlings, and 8,530 mu of second-class seedlings had been upgraded to first-class seedlings.
    The five secretaries of the commune party committee, the thirteen secretaries of the brigade party branches, and the eighty-three secretaries of the production team branches organized 313 experienced farmers and 83 agricultural technicians from the production teams to conduct field consultations separately, finding out the "illness" of the third-class and second-class seedlings plot by plot, and wrote on bamboo signs what kind of fertilizer, how much, how many times, when to apply it, other field management measures, and the name of the manager for each plot, so that they could have a clear understanding and prescribe the right medicine. After curing one plot, they recorded one credit on the bamboo sign. In order to improve the level of field management, the teams and groups also adopted the method of field consultation during the day and classroom training at night, training 7,650 young male and female commune members. All 404 operation groups in the commune formulated specific plans for eliminating third-class seedlings and improving second-class seedlings based on the results of field diagnosis. Generally, four key links were grasped: First, apply fertilizer early, applying fertilizer reasonably by looking at the fields, looking at the seedlings, and looking at the varieties. Second, cultivate in time, cultivating by looking at the fields, looking at the water, and looking at the seedlings; cultivating while applying fertilizer, supplementing seedlings, and removing weeds. Third, irrigate and drain reasonably, carrying out scientific irrigation and drainage by looking at the seedlings, looking at the soil quality, looking at the weather, looking at the cultivation situation, and looking at the water storage capacity of the fields. Fourth, prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests.
    They regarded the elimination of third-class seedlings and the improvement of second-class seedlings as the key to current field management, with key personnel divided into groups to take charge of areas, and commune members responsible for plots, setting up camps on the edges of third-class seedling fields to conduct experiments, and launching a mass seedling upgrading campaign. The entire commune had 494 cadres working with commune members to conduct experiments on 839 mu of fields to eliminate third-class seedlings, and set up 77 camp sheds on the edges of remote fields, carefully cultivating the seedlings. Each team, with party members and youth league members as the core and the field management responsibility area as the basis, established 401 collaborative assault battle groups, each group with four to six people, adopting a responsibility system of assigning people, assigning land, assigning measures, assigning quality, assigning work points, assigning rewards, and regularly eliminating third-class seedlings and improving second-class seedlings, contracting 6,347 mu of third-class seedlings and 11,915 mu of second-class seedlings to commune members, accepting tasks in the fields, and explaining diagnostic measures. In this way, the sense of responsibility of the masses was further strengthened, and within two days, 3,531 party members, youth league members, and other commune members built sheds on the edges of the fields to serve the seedlings.
    In order to strengthen leadership and ensure the quality of work, the commune, brigade, and production team all established command organizations and inspection and acceptance teams for the seedling upgrading campaign, and launched evaluations and competitions. The teams, groups, and individuals were bustling with activity. Zhou Zhengqing, a commune member of the Shimen Production Team of Badou Brigade, contracted 5.5 mu of third-class seedlings, and Zhou Zhuyu, who lived in the same house, also contracted 4.2 mu of third-class seedlings. The two challenged each other. After two days of hard work, Zhou Zhengqing's 5.5 mu of fields completed the tasks of cultivating, applying fertilizer, and irrigating quickly and well according to the quality requirements, and red flags were planted in every plot. However, only 1.2 mu of Zhou Zhuyu's 4.2 mu of fields were planted with red flags, the remaining 3 mu of fields had rough cultivation, the missing seedlings were not supplemented well, the three gaps in the water retaining piles were not built well, and the quantity and quality of fertilizer applied did not meet the requirements, so they were not accepted during inspection. Zhou Zhuyu felt that he had not fulfilled his responsibilities, and hurriedly discussed it with his wife. That night, the couple applied two dan of manure from their own toilet, the sewage from their home, 15 dan of grass ash, and topsoil mud to the fields without registering them in advance. The next morning, they rushed to work, supplementing the missing seedlings and building the water retaining piles, and treading the second pass on the roughly cultivated plots. During the second inspection and acceptance by the team cadres, they met the quality standards and were planted with red flags, catching up with Zhou Zhengqing.
    Now the mass seedling upgrading campaign is being carried out in depth. Within five days, the entire commune accumulated more than 800,000 dan of fertilizer, and an average of 47 dan of quick-acting fertilizer had been applied to 6,347 mu of third-class seedlings and 8,530 mu of second-class seedlings, and a first cultivation was carried out to remove weeds, all missing and floating seedlings had been supplemented, the gaps on the edges of the fields had been repaired or piled, and the work of storing and managing water had been further improved. The field management work of the entire commune is becoming more and more detailed, with people responsible for predicting the weather in each group, and people responsible for forecasting insect conditions in each plot.

### 田间会诊　对症下药  陆川县委领导群众诊断三类苗掀起田间管理高潮  岳阳毛田公社逐丘插标开展群众性禾苗升级运动

    田间会诊　对症下药
    陆川县委领导群众诊断三类苗掀起田间管理高潮
    岳阳毛田公社逐丘插标开展群众性禾苗升级运动
    本报南宁15日电　看任何事情只看一时的、表面的现象都是难以得到正确的结论的，看禾苗也是这样。过去，人们往往把生长繁茂的禾苗划成一类禾；可是，今年陆川县的农民却把一部分过于旺盛、叶子又长又宽的禾苗划成三类禾。因为这样的禾苗容易早期倒伏，以致严重减产，必须及早注意加强管理。
    中共陆川县委在早稻田间管理初期，就领导社员对三类禾的标准和形成的原因开展了讨论。大家认为造成三类禾的原因很多，有些是先天的，有些是后天的，情况十分复杂。中共陆川县委的领导人员还到清湖公社的陆落大队，虚心向群众求策问计，和群众一道临田察看，田头会诊，获得了看禾施肥、因苗用水的经验。他们根据不同情况的禾苗，确定了六种不同的管理方案。第一种是先天优越，过于旺盛的丰产田，由于分蘖过多，发育不正常，大有倒伏危险，因此，决定立即放水，实行浅灌，暂不追肥，到拔节前再施放磷钾肥；第二种是秧地田，禾苗插下后久不转青，不长新根，主要原因是基肥不足，插秧较晚，决定大放木叶压青，再施人粪尿或石灰，促使早生快发；第三种是秧苗遭冻，先天受挫，插下后又黄又老，萎蘼不振，对这种禾苗决定施“四味汤”（人尿、火灰、鸡鸭粪和硝坭的混合肥）；第四种是山冲冷水田，长满青红浮萍，禾秆软，不分蘖，采取排水晒田、施放石灰等措施，以增加土温；第五种禾苗是插下发黄，不生新根，决定用火灰冲人尿和开水泼下，摧根快长；第六种是秧根粪不好，禾苗转青迟慢，决定暂不耘田，用水肥淋禾，促使转青。经过这样的全面鉴定，具体处理，全大队的三类禾苗在六天内全部消灭。
    县委紧紧抓住这面旗帜，召开现场会议，兴风鼓浪，使陆落大队的经验变成全县各地的经验。全县田间管理运动顿时卷起了高潮。全县三十万早稻现已耘过三遍，每亩追肥二百担；三类禾由九万多亩下降到两万多亩，绝大部分禾苗丘丘整齐，株株茁壮。
    三类禾能否迅速升级，中心环节在于积肥多少和田间管理责任制是否层层落实。陆川县各公社在田间管理初期即抽调一定力量，掀起了第二次积肥运动。在田间管理责任制方面，上至领导下至群众都作了妥善的安排。全县九个公社划分为南、中、北三个片，有三个县委书记和委员分工包干领导，各公社党委书记和委员分别包干到大队，大队、生产队干部分别包干到垌，社员包管到田，做到块块有兵，垌垌有将。
    据新湖南报报道　岳阳毛田公社采取临田会诊、逐丘插标、田头扎营、大搞竞赛的办法，开展了群众性的禾苗升级、消灭三类禾的突击运动，五天内，全公社有六千三百四十七亩三类禾已上升为二类禾，八千五百三十亩二类禾已上升为一类禾。
    公社党委五个书记、十三个大队总支书记和八十三个生产队支部书记即组织了三百一十三个有经验的农民和八十三个生产队的农业技术员，分头临田会诊，一丘一丘找出三类禾、二类禾的“病情”，并把某丘田需要追什么肥、追多少、追几次、何时追，田间管理的其它各项措施，和管理员姓名写在竹牌上，插在田头，以便心中有数，对症下药。治好一丘后即在竹牌上记下一功。为了提高田间管理水平，各队、组还采取了白天田边会诊，晚上上课训练的办法，培训了七千六百五十个男女青年社员。全社四百零四个作业组都根据临田诊断结果，订出了本组消灭三类禾、提高二类禾的具体规划。一般都抓住了四大环节：首先是及早追肥，看田、看禾、看品种合理追肥。第二是及时中耕，看田、看水、看禾中耕；边中耕、边追肥、边补蔸、边除稗扯草。第三是合理排灌，看禾、看土质、看天色、看耕作情况、看田的蓄水量进行科学排灌。第四是防治病虫害。
    他们把消灭三类禾，提高二类禾作为当前田间管理的关键，骨干分组包片，社员包丘，三类禾田边扎营搞试验，大搞群众性的禾苗升级运动。全社有四百九十四名干部同社员一道搞了消灭三类禾的试验田八百三十九亩，并在边远的田边搭起了七十七个营棚，细心培育禾苗。各队以党员团员骨干为核心，以田间管理责任区为基础，建立了四百零一个协作突击战斗小组，每个小组四至六人，采取定人、定地、定措施、定质量、定工分、定奖励、定期消灭三类禾提高二类禾的责任制，把六千三百四十七亩三类禾和一万一千九百一十五亩二类禾，用合同承包的办法，包到社员，临田接受任务，交代诊断措施。这样，群众的责任感更为加强，两天内即有三千五百三十一个党员团员骨干分子和其它社员一起，在田边搭棚，侍候禾苗。
    为了加强领导，保证工作质量，公社、大队、生产队都成立了禾苗升级运动的指挥机构和检查验收小组，开展评比竞赛。队、组、个人之间闹得热火朝天。八斗大队石门生产队社员周正清承包了五点五亩三类禾，同屋的周竹玉也承包了四点二亩三类禾。两人互相挑战。经过两天奋战，周正清包的五点五亩田按照质量要求又快又好地完成了中耕追肥和排灌任务，丘丘插上了红旗。可是周竹玉包的四点二亩田只一点二亩田插上了红旗，其余三亩田中耕粗糙，缺蔸未补好，三个缺口拦水桩未打好，追肥数量、质量未达到要求，检查时未予验收。周竹玉感到没尽到责任，连忙和爱人商量，当晚夫妻俩就把自己厕所里的二担大粪、家里的污水、十五担草木灰和地皮泥，来不及事先登记就下到了田里。第二天清早出工，又赶忙补好蔸，打了拦水桩，对中耕粗糙的丘踩了第二道。队干部二次检查验收时，符合质量标准，插上了红旗，赶上了周正清。
    现在群众性的禾苗升级运动正在深入开展。五天时间内，全社积肥八十多万担，已在六千三百四十七亩三类禾和八千五百三十亩二类禾中平均追施了速效肥四十七担，进行了一道中耕除稗除草，所有漏蔸、浮蔸已全部补好，田边缺口都进行了整理或打了桩，蓄水管水工作进一步作好了。全社田间管理工作越做越细，组组都有人负责预测天气，丘丘有人负责预报虫情。（附图片）
