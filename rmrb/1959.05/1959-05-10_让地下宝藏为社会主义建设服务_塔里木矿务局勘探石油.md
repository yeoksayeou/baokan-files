　　Let Underground Treasures Serve Socialist Construction
　　Tarim Mining Bureau Explores for Oil
　　(Our report) To continue ascertaining the oil reserves in the Tarim area, the Tarim Mining Bureau of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has recently dispatched 47 geological and geophysical exploration teams, including nearly a thousand field exploration personnel, to the Kuche Depression, the West Kashgar Depression, and the Lop Nur area in the lower reaches of the Tarim River to conduct general surveys, detailed surveys, and detailed measurements based on last year's exploration work. At present, these field exploration teams have arrived at their work locations and have officially launched various exploration activities.

　　This year, in addition to some electrical logging teams, seismic teams, and geological teams working in Aksu, Bachu, and Hotan, the Tarim Mining Bureau has concentrated its main force in the Kuche Depression and the West Kashgar Depression to carry out detailed geological surveys, underground measurements, and other work, and to conduct drilling operations on the most promising oil-bearing structures. The Kuche Depression is currently the most promising oil-bearing area in the Tarim region, with many oil and gas shows. In some places, last year's drilling even yielded a large amount of crude oil. It is expected that after this year's detailed surveys and drilling operations, two to three oil fields and several oil-bearing structures suitable for drilling can be found. To this end, the Tarim Mining Bureau has not only concentrated more than a dozen geological teams, gravity teams, seismic teams, and a large number of drilling rigs here, but also established a work headquarters in Kuche.

　　The 505 gravity and magnetic survey team, which has entered and exited the Taklamakan Desert nine times last year, has organized 150 camels this year to conduct a general survey of the eastern part of the Taklamakan Desert and the Lop Nur area. In the past, people always believed that Lop Nur was a mysterious lake, surrounded by swamps, and that carelessly walking around could lead to the danger of being trapped in the mud, making work there even more difficult than in the Taklamakan Desert. In order to find more oil for the country, this heroic survey team that conquered the Taklamakan Desert has accepted this even more arduous task this year. The team members are full of confidence and have proposed the heroic slogan of "completing a year's task in half a year."

### 让地下宝藏为社会主义建设服务  塔里木矿务局勘探石油

　　让地下宝藏为社会主义建设服务
    塔里木矿务局勘探石油
    本报讯　为了继续摸清塔里木地区的石油蕴藏情况，新疆石油管理局塔里木矿务局最近在去年勘探工作的基础上，又向各地派出了四十七个包括近千名野外勘探人员的地质队和地球物理勘探队，到库车洼地、西喀什洼地和塔里木河最下游的罗布泊一带进行普查、详查和细测等工作。现在，这些野外勘探队已到达工作地点，并正式展开了各项勘探活动。
    塔里木矿务局今年除有部分电测队、地震队和地质队在阿克苏、巴楚、和阗等地进行工作外，他们把主要力量都集中在库车洼地和西喀什洼地进行地质详查、地底测量等工作，并在最有希望的储油构造上进行钻探工作。库车洼地是目前塔里木地区含油最有希望的地方，这里油气苗显示很多，有的地方在去年钻探中还喷出了大量原油，预计经过今年的详查和钻探工作后，就可找出二至三个油田和几个可供钻探的储油构造。为此，塔里木矿务局不仅在这里集中了十几个地质队、重力队、地震队和大量钻机，而且在库车还成立了工作指挥部。
    去年曾九进九出塔克拉玛干大沙漠的五零五重磁力普查队，今年又组织了一百五十峰骆驼，到塔克拉玛干大沙漠的东部及罗布泊地区进行普查工作。过去人们一直认为罗布泊是一个神秘的大湖泊，它的周围到处都是沼泽地带，走路一不小心，就有被陷进稀泥中的危险，比在塔克拉玛干大沙漠进行工作还要困难。为了给国家寻找出更多的石油，这支征服了塔克拉玛干大沙漠的英雄普查队，今年又接受了这一更加艰巨的任务，队员们个个信心百倍，他们提出“一年任务，半年完成”的英雄口号。
