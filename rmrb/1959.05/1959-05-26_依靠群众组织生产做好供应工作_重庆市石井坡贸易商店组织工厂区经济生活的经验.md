The Shijingpo Trading Store in Chongqing is a comprehensive store in the industrial and mining area, responsible for the supply of food, clothing, and daily necessities for more than 55,000 factory workers and their families. It has 39 business outlets, including general merchandise, non-staple foods, restaurants, barber shops, laundry and dyeing, photography, and Chinese medicine shops. Since the second half of last year, due to the rapid development of industry, the population has suddenly more than doubled. The goods originally allocated to us were not enough to supply. Under the leadership of the district committee and the factory party committee, we mobilized the masses, continuously improved the supply work in the industrial and mining area, organized the people's economic life, and actively organized production to expand the source of goods, which achieved initial results.

        Arranging Meals for the Masses

After the expansion of the factory and the increase in population, the first problem faced was how to arrange meals for the newly added workers. The factory's original four large canteens were not enough, and it was inconvenient for many workers to go home for meals because they lived far away. The factory was busy with production, and it could not arrange for additional canteens in terms of manpower and management for a while. At this time, according to the policy of serving production and serving the workers, we adopted three methods to assist the factory in solving the workers' meal problems.

    I. Implement "one package and three cooperations" for the employee canteens run by the factory itself. That is: the store contracts for the supply of non-staple foods, and directly sends the vegetables organized from the suburban people's communes to these canteens. Our state-owned restaurant also adjusted its business hours, location, and variety of dishes. When the employee canteens are not open, the state-owned restaurant opens to supply; when the employee canteens lack certain types of dishes, the state-owned restaurant tries to supply them; when there are too many people eating in the employee canteens and they are crowded, the state-owned restaurant sets up business outlets nearby, contracts for meals (collecting food stamps), and appropriately disperses the number of people eating. Through these measures, the meal problems of most workers in the factory were solved.

    II. Improve the supply methods of state-owned restaurants to facilitate workers in every possible way. We run workshop restaurants, where state-owned restaurants send people to set up stoves next to the workshops to cook meals. Generally, business hours are until two or three o'clock in the morning, and sometimes they are open all night, so that workers on the night shift can eat as soon as they get off work. For workers who bring their own meals, the restaurant also helps them heat them up. This workshop restaurant is very popular with workers. When the workshop restaurant did not have a house, the workers helped build it. When the business was too busy, the party and government cadres of the workshop came to help sell meals. At the same time, we also added fast food, simple meals, and simple canteens in state-owned restaurants to handle the meals of temporary boarders and arrange the meals for the floating population.

    III. Assist the families of employees in running family canteens well, and gradually develop them into service departments for the lives of employees' families. The main methods to help employees' families run canteens are: to help them improve their cooking skills, so that the meals are varied, dry, thin, soft, and hard; to establish simple and easy-to-implement systems; to help solve the difficulties of insufficient equipment; and to give appropriate consideration to the supply of non-staple foods, so that the meals made by the family canteens can ensure that employees eat enough, eat well, save money, and save food. Originally, some people were unwilling to board in the family canteens, but when they saw that the family canteens were well run, with only five yuan or more per person per month, and only eight yuan for eating better, they joined the boarding one after another. Now there are nine family canteens, with more than 10,000 boarders, and the largest canteen has more than 3,000 boarders. On the basis of running the canteens well, we have also helped various canteens to gradually add items such as boiled water and alcoholic beverages to further facilitate the masses.

The above three forms show the role of combining large (factory collective canteens), medium (restaurants), and small (family food groups), so in a very short period of time, the meal problems of all factory employees and temporary workers were arranged.

  Meeting the Diverse Needs of Workers

Since last year, many family members have participated in production, and there are some trivial matters in the family life of employees that need to be solved with external help. In this regard, we have adopted a combination of self-run and mass-run methods to increase the number of service items by 15, which has initially solved some of the daily needs of the masses. Our methods are in three forms:

    1. Increase business items ourselves: For some industries with relatively high technical requirements, requiring certain funds and equipment, suitable for centralized operation, and generally needed by the majority of workers, such as photography, laundry and dyeing, and Chinese medicine shops, we adjusted a part from the district through the Commercial Bureau to be led by the store in a unified manner to meet the needs of workers' lives.

    2. Mass self-run, public management (or mass self-run, public assistance): Most of these industries are simple to operate, have simple equipment or do not need equipment, and are suitable for decentralized operation, such as washing clothes, mending old clothes, shining shoes, repairing shoes, etc. We organize some elderly and weak people with more difficult lives to participate in these jobs through mass organizations. The store manages these industries in terms of raw material supply and prices, and uses a small amount of money to help them add some simple tools, and gradually withdraws and returns from the income in the future.

    3. For some repair industries (such as repairing clocks, shoes, pens, flashlights) and industries such as Chinese medicine and storytelling artists, we mainly adopt the method of inviting them in, arranging business locations for them, negotiating charging standards, and asking them to do business in the factory to meet the needs of workers.

  Rational Distribution of Goods and Improved Supply

Under the new situation, some non-staple foods and certain daily-use industrial products are in short supply. We feel that to do a good job in supply work, the first thing is to do a good job in the rational distribution of goods. Whether the rational distribution of goods can be done well, and whether the setting of supply points and supply methods are reasonable are extremely important. We have added 23 supply points and paid attention to rational layout; on the other hand, with the help of the factory party committee, we have established 16 consignment shops according to the family residential areas. Through this supply network covering the entire area, goods are sold nearby to make up for the deficiencies of the original supply points. In terms of supply methods, we have formed a factory-wide economic life committee with the factory welfare department, the town people's committee, and family representatives. Relying on this organization, according to the economic policies stipulated by the higher authorities, combined with the characteristics of the factory area, and following the principle of ensuring key points, taking care of special needs, and arranging general needs, we rationally distribute goods. Except for collective consumption units, which are uniformly distributed by the store, the goods needed by employees and their families are rationally distributed through consignment shops by economic life groups established in sections. In special cases, such as couples who both participate in production, we also adopt the methods of booking sales and delivering goods to the door.

  Relying on the Masses to Produce Live and Fresh Products

To do a good job in the supply work in the industrial and mining area, it is necessary to actively organize the production of non-staple foods from many aspects, especially the development of local production, increase the source of goods, and supply them locally, which is particularly important. At the beginning of the work, we grasped the main problem of developing the production of non-staple foods and adopted the method of relying on the masses to carry out a large-scale mass movement to increase the production of live and fresh products. Improve supply work. In specific practices, we adopted the following three forms:

    The first is to jointly run breeding farms with the commune. With the consent of the factory party committee, we took out a part of the factory director fund as capital, and the commune contributed manpower, feed, and seeds to jointly run collective breeding farms to increase the production of pigs and poultry to solve the needs of employees. In order to encourage the commune's enthusiasm for developing the production of live and fresh products, we agreed with the commune that all the products of the breeding farm, except for seed retention, could be retained by the commune in a certain amount, and the rest would be sold by us. At the same time, the store would send people to the farm to control economic expenditures. If losses occurred, we would bear 80% and the commune would bear 20%; if there was a surplus, we would divide 20% to us and 80% to the commune (currently all used for expanding reproduction and are not temporarily extracted). From the two breeding farms that we jointly run with the Jingkou Commune and the Tongguanyi Commune, it can be seen that they have a good effect on developing production and ensuring supply. These two breeding farms were only recently prepared, and so far they have raised more than 5,000 various small poultry and small livestock, and it is expected that they will develop to more than 30,000 by the end of the year. We believe that this practice is actually to establish some small professional bases in the people's commune, which not only enables the commercial departments to master reliable sources of goods, but also can provide comprehensive cooperation between industry, agriculture, and commerce in the future, and the commune can support the factory with non-staple foods, and the factory can help the commune realize industrialization, mechanization, and electrification, and further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.

    The second is to mobilize the masses to raise livestock separately. According to the characteristics of the relatively scattered residential areas of the factory, we mobilized the families of employees to raise chickens in every household and pigs in every section ("section" is a grassroots organization unit of residents led by the street people's committee, all of which have family food groups). We mobilized the masses to solve the breeding poultry themselves, or save the eggs and not eat them, but keep them for incubation; if they cannot find breeding poultry and livestock, we will organize the supply, and explain in advance that a part should be sold to the store later. The feed is to use the swill and rotten vegetable leaves from various food groups and family households in the factory, and the state will no longer allocate grain. For example, the seventh section has 707 households, with 250 kilograms of swill and 200 kilograms of rotten vegetable leaves every day, totaling more than 13,000 kilograms per month, which can raise at least 15 pigs. The chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, etc. raised separately are mainly for self-sufficiency, but the pigs within the scope of national planned purchase are stipulated to allocate a part of the planned supply when they are eaten; the unsold ones can also be organized by the store for purchase or organization of adjustment. Since the implementation of this method, the masses have been very supportive. After a short period of publicity, every household has raised chickens and every section has raised pigs. According to incomplete statistics in early April, more than 4,000 employee families have raised more than 5,000 chickens, with the most households raising 21 chickens; nine family sections have also raised 30 pigs, and it is expected that by the end of the year, each household can raise more than four chickens and each section can raise 15 pigs.

    Third, we run our own demonstrative breeding farms, raising some small livestock (rabbits, sheep) and chickens, ducks, geese, etc., a small part as breeding livestock and poultry, and most of them as a supplement to the shortage of meat in the restaurant and to add varieties. At present, more than 100 sheep and more than 300 rabbits have been raised.

After the above work, although we have achieved many results in developing production, increasing the source of non-staple foods, arranging for employees to eat, dress, and live, there are still some problems from the requirements of the work that need to be continuously worked hard in the future to do a better job in organizing the economic life of the masses.

    依靠群众组织生产做好供应工作
    ——重庆市石井坡贸易商店组织工厂区经济生活的经验
          中共石井坡贸易商店支部书记  刘惠兰
    石井坡贸易商店是工矿区的综合商店，担负工厂职工及家属约五万五千多人的吃、穿、用等方面的供应任务，设有日用百货、副食品、餐厅、理发室、洗染、照像、中药铺等共三十九个营业点。去年下半年以来，由于工业发展很快，人口骤然增加了一倍以上。原来分配给我们的商品不够供应了。在区委、工厂党委的领导下，发动群众，不断改进工矿区的供应工作，组织人民经济生活，并积极组织生产，扩大货源，收到了初步效果。
        安排群众伙食
    工厂扩建、人口增加以后，首先面临的问题是新增加的工人伙食如何安排。厂内原有的四个大食堂不够应用，而许多工人离家远，回去吃饭不方便。厂里忙于生产，增添食堂一时在人力上、管理工作上还安排不过来，这时，我们根据为生产、为工人服务的方针，采取了三种办法，协助工厂解决工人伙食问题。
    一、对工厂自办的职工食堂实行“一包三配合”。即：商店包干供应副食品，把从郊区人民公社组织来的蔬菜直接送到这些食堂去。我们所经营的国营餐厅在营业时间、地点、菜的品种三个方面也进行了调整，职工食堂不开饭的时候，国营餐厅就开门供应；职工食堂缺少的某些菜类，国营餐厅就设法供应；职工食堂人多吃饭拥挤的时候，国营食堂就在附近设营业点，包办伙食（照收粮票），适当分散吃饭人数。通过这些措施，解决了厂内大部分工人的吃饭问题。
    二、改进国营餐厅的供应办法，千方百计便利工人。我们举办车间餐厅，由国营餐厅派人到车间旁边搭灶做饭，一般营业时间到深夜两三点钟，必要时通宵营业，使夜班的工人一下班就能吃到饭。工人自己带饭来的，餐厅还帮助他们蒸热了。这个车间餐厅很受工人欢迎。车间餐厅没有房子，工人们就动手帮助搭房子，营业忙不过来的时候，车间党政干部就来协助卖饭菜。同时，我们还在国营餐厅增加了快餐、便餐、开办简易食堂等项目，办理临时搭伙人员的伙食，安排流动人口的吃饭问题。
    三、协助职工家属办好家属食堂，并逐步地使它发展成为职工家属生活的服务部。帮助职工家属办食堂的办法主要是：帮助她们提高烹调技术，使饭菜多种多样，干的、稀的、软的、硬的都有；建立简单易行的制度；帮助解决设备不足的困难；并在副食品的供应上给予适当照顾，使家属食堂做的饭菜，保证职工吃饱、吃好、省钱、省粮。原来有些人不愿意到家属食堂搭伙的，见到家属食堂办得好，每人每月有五元多钱就够了，吃得好一些也只花八元，便纷纷参加搭伙。现在共办了九个家属食堂，搭伙的已超过一万人，最大的食堂有三千多人搭伙。在搞好食堂的基础上，我们又帮助各个食堂逐步增办开水、酒类等项目，进一步便利群众。
    以上三种形式，显示了大（工厂集体食堂）中（餐厅）、小（家属伙食团）相结合的作用，因而在很短的时期内安排好全厂职工和临时工人的吃饭问题。
  满足工人多方面需要
    去年以来，很多家属参加生产，在职工家庭生活中有一些琐事需要依靠外面来帮助解决。在这方面，我们采取自办和发动群众办相结合的方法，增加服务项目十五种，初步解决了群众一些日常需要。我们的作法有三种形式：
    1、自己增加经营项目：我们对某些技术性较大，需要一定资金设备，适宜于集中经营，又为广大工人普遍需要的行业，如照像、洗染、中药铺等，通过商业局从区内调整一部分给我们，统一由商店领导，满足工人生活上的需要。
    2、群众自办，公家管理（或群众自办公家帮助）：这类行业大部分为操作简便，设备简单或不要设备，而又适合分散经营的，如洗衣服、缝补旧衣物、擦皮鞋、修理鞋子等，就通过群众团体组织一些生活较为困难的老弱参与这些工作。商店对这些行业在原材料供应和价格上加以管理，并用少数的钱帮助他们增置一些简便工具，以后从收益中逐步抽出归还。
    3、对某些修理行业（如修钟表、皮鞋、钢笔、电筒）和中医、说唱艺人等行业，主要采取请进来的办法，为他们安排营业地点，议定收费标准，请他们到厂内营业，满足工人的需要。
  合理分配商品改进供应
    在新形势下，一部分副食品和某些日用工业品出现供不应求的情况。我们感到，要做好供应工作，首先就要做好合理分配商品。合理分配商品能否做好，供应点的设置和供应方法是否合理，极为重要。我们增设了二十三个供应点，并注意合理摆布；另一方面，依靠工厂党委的帮助，按家属居住区成立了十六个代销店，通过这个遍设全区的供应网就近出售商品，弥补原有供应点的不足。在供应方法上，我们会同工厂福利部门、镇人委及家属代表组成一个全厂经济生活委员会，依靠这个组织，根据上级规定的经济政策，结合厂区特点，按照保证重点、照顾特殊、安排一般的原则，对商品进行合理分配。除集体消费单位由商店统一分配外，对职工及家属所需要的商品，分段成立的经济生活小组，通过代销店进行合理分配。有特殊情况的如夫妇两人都参加生产，还采取预约售货、送货上门的办法。
  依靠群众生产活鲜商品
    要做好工矿区的供应工作，需要从多方面积极组织副食品生产，特别是就地发展生产，增加货源，就地供应，特别重要。在工作一开始我们抓住了发展副食品生产这一主要问题，采取依靠群众大搞群众运动的方法来增产活鲜商品。改进供应工作。在具体作法上，我们采取了以下三种形式：
    第一种，与公社合办饲养场。我们取得了工厂党委的同意，拿出了一部分厂长基金作为资金，公社出人力、饲料、种子，合办集体饲养场，增产生猪、家禽，解决职工需要。为了鼓励公社对发展活鲜商品生产的积极性，我们和公社议定饲养场的全部产品，除留种以外，公社可以自留一定数量，其余全部由我们包销，同时由商店派人驻场掌握经济开支，发生亏损，我们负担八成，公社负担二成；有盈余我们分二成，公社分八成（目前均作为扩大再生产之用，暂不提成）。从我们与井口公社、铜罐驿公社合办的两个饲养场来看，对发展生产、保证供应都有着较好的效果。这两个饲养场都是不久以前才筹备起来的，到目前为止已经饲养了各种小家禽和小家畜五千多只，预计年内可发展到三万多只。我们认为，这种作法实际上是在人民公社建立一些小型的专业基地，不但使商业部门掌握了可靠的货源，而且今后还可以为工农商之间的全面协作，公社支援工厂副食品，工厂帮助公社实现工业化、机械化、电气化，进一步加强工农联盟。
    第二种是发动群众分散饲养。根据厂区住宅较为分散的特点，发动职工家属户户养鸡、段段养猪（“段”是街人委所领导的居民基层组织单位，都有家属伙食团）。动员群众自己解决种禽，或者省下蛋不吃留着孵抱；找不到种禽、种畜的由我们组织供应，事前说明以后应卖给商店一部分。饲料是利用厂内各个伙食团和家属住户的泔水、烂菜叶等，国家不再拨给粮食。例如，第七段有七百零七户人家，每天有泔水二百五十斤，烂菜叶二百斤，每月共有一万三千多斤，至少能养猪十五头。属于分散饲养出来的鸡、鸭、猪、羊等主要是自给自食，但属于国家计划收购范围内的生猪，规定在食用时要批一部分计划供应量；食用不完的也可以由商店组织收购或组织调剂。这个办法实行以来，群众很支持，仅仅经过短时间宣传，就实现了家家养鸡，段段养猪，根据4月初不完全统计，四千多户职工家属已养鸡五千多只，最多的一户养二十一只；九个家属段也养猪三十头，预计到年底每户养鸡可达四只以上，每段养猪可达十五头。
    第三，自己兴办示范性的饲养场，养殖一些小家畜（兔、羊）和鸡鸭鹅等，小部分作为种畜种禽，大部分作为补助餐厅的肉食不足和增添品种。目前已养羊一百多只，兔子三百多只。
    经过以上工作，我们虽然在发展生产、增加副食品货源、安排职工吃饭、穿衣、生活服务等方面收到不少效果。但从工作的要求来看，还存在一些问题，需要在今后继续努力，把组织群众经济生活的工作做得更好。
