    Art Records
    The Shanghai China Record Factory has recently trial-produced several types of art song records. From a distance, they look like beautiful picture cards. They use colored pictures as the base, covered with a layer of transparent polyvinyl chloride film. They are not only beautiful but also light to carry and not easily broken.

    美术唱片
    上海中国唱片厂最近试制成功的几种美术歌片，远看好像是一张张美丽的画片。它们是用彩色图画作底子，面上复盖一层透明的聚氯乙烯薄膜。不仅好看，而且携带轻便、不易碰碎。
