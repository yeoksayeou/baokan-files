Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Nationalities Affairs Commission hosted a banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening to see off the first group of over two hundred Tibetan students who are returning to Tibet this year to participate in democratic reform and construction work.

Chairman Mao Zedong received this group of Tibetan students when he received the minority nationality visiting delegation on the 7th, which greatly encouraged them. These students recently graduated from the Central Institute for Nationalities and other schools, and they came to Beijing to study at different times since 1954. Among these students, some are children of serf families, and some are poor herdsmen and handicraftsmen. In the past, they suffered the cruel exploitation and oppression of the reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet and the imperialists. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army liberated them from the cruel and dark serf system. Later, according to their wishes, they came to study at the Central Institute for Nationalities.

Attending tonight's banquet were Wang Feng, Yang Jingren, and Xie Hechou, vice chairmen of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, and Su Keqin, vice president of the Central Institute for Nationalities, among others.

Wang Feng spoke at the banquet, congratulating the Tibetan students returning to Tibet on taking up their glorious posts. Wang Feng said: With the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion, the conditions for realizing national regional autonomy and democratic reform in Tibet will be even more complete; the economy and culture of the Tibetan region will develop rapidly. There is no doubt that doing this work well is a glorious task and also an arduous struggle. In his speech, Wang Feng encouraged the Tibetan students to resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, maintain close ties with the masses, work actively, and study diligently after returning to Tibet, so as to make achievements in the work of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Zhang Jingwu encouraged the students who are returning to work in Tibet to always love the great motherland, always listen to the Party, work wholeheartedly for the working people of Tibet, and constantly train and improve themselves.

Tibetan student Gengque Laga spoke on behalf of the returning Tibetan students. Gengque Laga began living a miserable life as a serf from the age of four. He said: We have already understood that if Tibet wants to progress, it must take the socialist road under the leadership of the Party; if the Tibetan people want to be happy, they must completely destroy the dark feudal serf system. He said: We assure the Party that, for the unity of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and in order to build Tibet into a prosperous and flourishing democratic and socialist paradise, we will firmly stand our ground and wage a merciless struggle against the feudal serf system and traitors who endanger the people. We will be loyal sons and daughters of the Party and the people of the motherland, always listen to the Party, and never fail to live up to the expectations of the Party and the people of the motherland.

The Tibetan students frequently raised their glasses during the banquet to celebrate the new life of Tibet.

    一支民主改革新军回西藏
    民委设宴欢送第一批藏族学生
    新华社15日讯　民族事务委员会今晚在北京饭店设宴，欢送今年第一批返回西藏参加民主改革和建设工作的两百多名藏族学生。
    毛泽东主席7日接见少数民族参观团时，同时接见了这批藏族学生，他们受到很大鼓舞。这些学生是刚从中央民族学院等校毕业的，他们从1954年先后来北京学习。在这批学生中，有些是农奴家庭的子弟，有些是贫苦的牧民和手工业者，过去受尽了西藏上层反动分子和帝国主义者的残酷剥削和压迫，西藏和平解放以后，共产党和人民解放军才把他们从残酷、黑暗的农奴制度下解放出来，以后按照他们的志愿先后来中央民族学院学习。
    参加今晚宴会的，有民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、杨静仁、谢鹤筹，中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武和中央民族学院副院长苏克勤等人。
    汪锋在宴会上讲了话，他祝贺回西藏的藏族学生走上光荣的工作岗位。汪锋说：随着西藏叛乱的平息，西藏实现民族区域自治和民主改革的条件将更加具备；西藏地区的经济和文化，将得到迅速发展。毫无疑问，做好这些工作，都是光荣的任务，也是艰巨的斗争。汪锋在讲话中勉励藏族学生们回到西藏后，要坚决依靠党的领导，密切联系群众，积极工作，努力学习，在建设民主和社会主义新西藏的工作中做出成绩。
    张经武在讲话中勉励回西藏工作的学生，要永远热爱伟大的祖国，永远听党的话，全心全意地为西藏的劳动人民而努力工作，不断地锻炼自己和提高自己。
    藏族学生更却拉加代表这批回西藏的学生致词。更却拉加从四岁多就开始过农奴的悲惨生活。他说：我们已经懂得：西藏要进步，就必须在党的领导下走社会主义道路；西藏人民要得到幸福，就必须彻底摧毁黑暗的封建农奴制度。他说：我们向党保证，为了祖国的统一和各民族的团结，为了把西藏建设成为一个繁荣昌盛的民主和社会主义的乐园，我们坚决站稳立场，向危害人民的封建农奴制度和叛国分子作无情斗争，我们要做党和祖国人民的忠实儿女，永远听党的话，绝不辜负党和祖国人民对我们的希望。
    藏族学生们在席间频频举杯祝贺西藏的新生。
