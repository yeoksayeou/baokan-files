Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Chairman Zhu De's speech at the airport to see off the People's Chamber Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, is as follows: Dear Chairman Dieckmann, Vice-Chairman Matern, dear comrades of the entire delegation, comrades, friends:

The People's Chamber Delegation of the German Democratic Republic is about to leave our country to return home after a friendly visit of more than a week. Now, we are here with reluctance to bid farewell to them. We deeply thank the comrades of the delegation for bringing the profound friendship of the German people to the Chinese people. The comrades' visit this time is a great encouragement to the people of our country and has made valuable contributions to the further development of the brotherly cooperation between the people of China and Germany.

Dear comrades, as you are about to leave us, I sincerely hope that you will bring the most sincere brotherly friendship of the Chinese people to the hardworking and intelligent German people. Although we are about to part temporarily, the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and our common cause will forever closely link the people of our two countries together. Our brotherly unity and cooperative relations will become increasingly close, and we will always move forward hand in hand.

I wish the German people greater victories in the noble cause of building their own socialist state of workers and peasants and striving for the reunification of their motherland on the basis of peace and democracy.

Long live the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and German people!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    新华社12日讯  朱德委员长在机场欢送德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的狄克曼主席，马特恩副主席，亲爱的代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团在我国进行了一个多星期的友好访问之后，就要离开我们回国了。现在，我们怀着惜别的心情来欢送他们。我们深深地感谢代表团的同志们给中国人民带来了德国人民的深厚友谊。代表团同志们这次的访问，对于我国人民是一个很大的鼓舞，并且对于进一步发展中德两国人民的兄弟合作关系作出了宝贵的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们，当你们即将离开我们的时候，我热诚地希望你们把中国人民的最真诚的兄弟友谊带给勤劳而富有智慧的德国人民。我们虽然就要暂时分别了，但是马克思列宁主义的伟大思想和共同事业，却把我们两国人民永远紧密地联结在一起。我们的兄弟团结和合作关系将愈来愈加亲密，我们将永远携手前进。
    祝德国人民在建设自己的工农社会主义国家和争取在和平民主的基础上统一自己祖国的崇高事业中，获得更大的胜利。
    中德人民的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
