"Three-Way Combination" Shines Radiantly
By our correspondents Lu Man and Sun Minghui

The night shift workers at the East Anshan Iron Mine had been on duty for a long time, but Xie Qiliang, the foreman of the day shift, and several workers were still busy beside the machines. They sometimes crawled into the cylindrical filter to check the parts, and sometimes listened carefully to the sound of the water pump running. They had been busy for many nights trying to solve the problem of excessive moisture content in the concentrate.

In recent days, Lao Xie had been coming early and leaving late. The leaders had repeatedly advised him to rest well, but he wouldn't listen to anything. It's no wonder Lao Xie was stubborn. Since the start of work, everything had been fine in other processes, but his section had a problem: the filtered concentrate powder was like thin porridge, with too much water content, making it impossible to sinter. Seeing this situation, Lao Xie was both anxious and ashamed. He was anxious because the East Anshan Mine had to supply Anshan Iron and Steel with concentrate powder to refine more than one million tons of high-quality steel this year, and if things continued like this, there would be no guarantee of completing the task. He was ashamed that the problem of excessive moisture content in the concentrate powder had not been solved for a long time. Even so, Lao Xie and many employees were not discouraged. They were trying to find ways day and night to reduce the moisture and increase the output.

Young worker Zhang Zhimin was one of those who thought of solutions day and night. One night, after he went to bed, he suddenly put on his clothes and walked back and forth on the ground. For many days, in order to solve the problem of moisture content in the concentrate, he either climbed into the machine to adjust the equipment, picked up a water pipe to wash the filter cloth, or ran upstairs to measure the slurry concentration. After work, he would also go to the library to find information. But he never got to the point. This night, after he went to bed, he suddenly remembered that in the past few days, whenever he flushed the filter cloth with water, more concentrate would be filtered out, and the moisture content would be lower. What was the reason for this? Was it the cloth or the water?

The next day at work, Zhang Zhimin told his idea to his colleague Dong Qingchen. Xiao Dong encouraged him to try it quickly. At work, Xiao Zhang concentrated on watching the filter. As soon as the moisture content of the concentrate powder came out high, he picked up the water pipe and flushed the filter cloth. Strangely enough, after ten minutes, the moisture content of the concentrate powder was reduced. He tried this many times in a row, and Xiao Zhang was really happy. At the same time that Zhang Zhimin thought of adding water, Geng Chuanzhen, a worker in another shift, also thought of the same method, and the effect of the experiment was the same as Xiao Zhang's. Dong Qingchen and many workers learned it, and the effects were all very good.

During this period, Foreman Xie Qiliang and some workers also had some success in improving equipment and operation; with the addition of clean water, production did improve for a few days. But after a while, the method of adding water stopped working: sometimes after adding water, the moisture content of the concentrate would actually increase. The improvement of equipment and operation only lasted for a few days. Why was this? The workers were all guessing. Someone said, what are the technicians doing? Why don't they come and help analyze it?

In fact, the technicians were also troubled by the excessive moisture content of the concentrate.

Li Renjuan, a technician in the flotation workshop, and Wang Zhenglian, a technician in the mine, were both young people with great enthusiasm for their work. They became anxious as soon as they discovered that the concentrate had high moisture content, just like the workers. While the workers were actively trying to reduce the moisture content, Li Renjuan set up a large pile of bottles in the laboratory, filled with slurry, water, ferrous ammonium sulfate, lime, brine, and other materials for testing. She would add lime to the slurry for a while, and then add ferrous ammonium sulfate, brine, and other materials to stir. After a while, it seemed that adding ferrous ammonium sulfate had a better effect. So she ran to the site to experiment. When the workers saw the technician coming, they helped carry bags of test materials from the first floor to the third floor. She added materials to the slurry again and again. However, the flowing slurry was different from the "dead" slurry in the laboratory. Even after adding ferrous ammonium sulfate, the concentrate coming out of the filter was still like thin porridge!

Before and after Li Renjuan conducted her experiments, Wang Zhenglian and other technicians also conducted a series of experiments. After many unsuccessful experiments, they suspected that there might be a problem with the operation. So they took instruments to the site to measure the machine's rotation speed, the vacuum degree of the vacuum pump, and the slurry concentration, and asked the workers to tighten this and that, but it still didn't work!

One day, Wang Zhenglian came to the filter operated by Zhang Zhimin and found that the concentrate powder was very dry. He asked what method he had used. Xiao Zhang told the technician about the method of adding water and explained that sometimes adding water was not good. Wang Zhenglian also tried it on a machine, and it was indeed good. These days, technicians and some cadres have been operating with the workers, and in the process of participating in labor, the method of adding water by workers such as Geng Chuanzhen has also been discovered. The method of adding water attracted attention. At this time, Director Zheng of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Secretary Liu of the mine's Party committee, who came to the mine to help, asked the technicians to seriously study why adding water was sometimes good and sometimes not. The proposal of this question was like opening a window, and then the water adding experiment began.

Director Zheng, cadres of the mine, and technicians such as Engineer Li of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, conducted experiments with workers on the No. 7 filter. Through experiments, the perplexing problem of the workers was clarified. It turned out that in order for adding water to be effective, it had to be based on a certain slurry concentration; the reason why adding water was sometimes good and sometimes not was because the slurry concentration and vacuum degree were different. Based on the rules found in the experiment, a set of operating procedures was formulated and the experience of adding water was promoted.

Before and after summarizing and promoting the experience of adding water, cadres, technicians, and workers also summarized and promoted the experience of repairing filter cloth (the filter cloth sometimes had holes, which were sewn up with needle and thread). As a result, the moisture content of the concentrate was reduced from about 15% in the past to about 13%; the output increased from more than 1,000 tons to more than 2,000 tons. The employees were planning to organize a high-yield battle on this basis, but the vacuum pump had another problem. The filtrate, which should have been sent back to the concentrate thickening tank by the centrifugal pump, was sucked in by the vacuum pump together with mud and water. If the vacuum pump had mud and water, it would not only easily damage the equipment, but also affect its ability to extract water from the filter. It was really a case of one hurdle just passed, and another hurdle encountered.

In order to solve this new problem, cadres, technicians, and workers were looking for reasons and thinking of ways all day and night. Repair workers stayed by the machines, and they would repair them immediately when something went wrong. Dong Qingchen, Zhang Zhimin, and many other workers also organized a "problem-solving team" to check the equipment one by one.

After many experiments and studies by cadres, workers, and technicians, it was found that the filtrate sucked into the steam-water separator by the filter could not be completely pumped out by the centrifugal pump in time because the capacity of the vacuum pump and the centrifugal pump was unbalanced: the centrifugal pump had a small capacity, and the filtrate that should have been pumped away by the centrifugal pump was sucked away by the powerful vacuum pump. How to increase the capacity of the centrifugal pump? Some people advocated adopting the opinions of old workers such as Xie Qiliang and Yao Shengguan: changing the steam-water separator from the current horizontal type to a vertical type. A long time ago, old workers such as Xie Qiliang had put forward this suggestion, but some people said at the time that some concentrators had used this method, and the effect was not good, so it had not been adopted. After a heated debate, some technicians believed that the suggestions of Lao Xie and other workers made sense; however, although changing the horizontal type to the vertical type would be higher from the vacuum pump, the capacity was probably still not enough; after repeated research by leading cadres such as Director Zheng and engineering and technical personnel, it was decided to move the steam-water separator to the upper floor, so that the distance would be higher. The result of testing one unit moved to the upper floor was very good. Then, the workers only took three days to move all 26 steam-water separators in the entire mine to the upper floor. From then on, the problem of insufficient capacity of the centrifugal pump was solved, and the moisture content of the concentrate in the entire mine has been below 13%, and the daily output has increased from more than 2,000 tons to more than 5,000 tons.

Now, the workers in the sintering workshop have come again with gongs and drums to send big-character posters. But this time it is not criticism but congratulations. The workers in the filtering section no longer bow their heads when they see people, and Lao Xie's pace is more energetic than in the past. Xiao Dong and some other workers have now joined the Party; young workers such as Zhang Zhimin have joined the League. However, none of the employees attributed the credit to themselves. They all said: This is the victory of the "three-way combination" proposed by the Party. (Attached image)

    “三结合”大放异彩
    本报记者　鲁蛮　孙铭惠
    东鞍山铁矿的夜班工人上班很久了，上白班的谢起良工长同几个工人还在机器旁边忙碌。他们时而钻进圆筒形的过滤机里检查机件，时而侧着耳朵静听水泵运转的声音。他们为了解决精矿含水量过大的问题，已经忙了好多个夜晚。
    这些日子，老谢总是早来晚走。领导上曾一再劝他好好休息，可是说什么他也不听。也不怪老谢固执，从开工以来，别的工序都好，就是他的工段出了问题：过滤出来的精矿粉，像稀粥似的，含水过多，不能烧结。看到这种情形，老谢又着急又惭愧。着急的是：东鞍山矿今年要供应鞍钢炼出一百万吨以上优质钢的精矿粉，而照这样下去，任务就没有把握完成；惭愧的是，精矿粉含水过多的问题，迟迟不得解决。虽然这样，老谢和许多职工可并没泄气，都在昼夜想办法，非把水分降下来，把产量跃上去不可。
    青年工人张志民就是昼夜想办法的一个。一天晚上，他睡下以后，又突然披起衣服，在地上来回走动。多少天来，为了解决精矿含水问题，他不是爬进机器里调整设备，拿起水管冲洗过滤布，就是跑到楼上测量矿浆浓度，下班以后他还去图书馆里找资料。可是总是得不到要领。这天晚上他睡下以后，忽然想起过去几天里，每当他冲水洗过滤布的时候，过滤出来的精矿就多，含水量就低。这是什么道理？是布还是水的关系？
    第二天上班的时候，张志民把自己的想法告诉了同班工人董庆臣。小董听了就鼓励他赶快试一试。小张在工作中，集中精力注视着过滤机，出来的精矿粉含水量一高，他就拿起水管往过滤布上冲水。说也怪，过了十几分钟，精矿粉的水分就降低了。这样一连试了多次，小张心里可真高兴极了。就在张志民想到加水这个办法的同时，另一个班的工人耿传珍也想到了同样的办法，试验的效果同小张的一样。董庆臣和好多工人都学起来，效果也都很好。
    这期间，谢起良工长和一些工人在改进设备和操作方面，也有了一定效果；加上加清水的办法，生产上的确好了几天。可是过些时候，加水的办法不好使了：有时加水后，精矿含水量反而高起来。改进了设备和操作，也只是好了几天。这是为什么？工人们都在猜疑。有人就说，技术人员都干什么去了，为什么不来帮助分析分析？
    其实，技术人员也在为精矿含水量过高而苦恼。
    浮选车间技术员李人娟和矿里技术员王政廉，都是青年人，工作热情很高，一发现精矿水分高，同工人一样发急。就在工人们积极想办法降低水分的时候，李人娟在试验室里摆了一大堆瓶子，里面装着矿浆、水、硫酸錏铁、石灰、卤水等化验用料。她一会儿把石灰加在矿浆里，一会又把硫酸錏铁、卤水等加在矿浆里搅拌。忙了一气，看起来加硫酸錏铁的效果较好。她便跑到现场去试验。工人们看到技术员来了，都帮着把一袋袋试料从一楼搬到三楼上来。她一次次地往矿浆里加料。可是，流动的矿浆同试验室里的
  “死”矿浆毕竟不同，加了硫酸錏铁，过滤机出来的精矿还是像稀粥一样！
    在李人娟进行试验的前后，王政廉和别的技术人员也进行了一系列的试验。多次试验都没有成功，他们便怀疑是不是操作上有问题。于是他们拿着仪器到现场测量机器转数、真空泵的真空度和矿浆浓度，又叫工人拧这拧那，但仍然不见效！
    一天，王政廉来到张志民操纵的过滤机前，发现精矿粉很干。就问是用了甚么办法。小张把加水的办法告诉了技术员，并且说明有时加水也不好。王政廉也在一台机器上试了一下，果然不错。这些日子，技术人员和一些干部同工人一起进行操作，在参加劳动的过程里，耿传珍等工人加水的方法也被发现了。加水的办法引起了重视。这时候，来矿上帮助工作的冶金工业部郑司长和矿党委刘书记，要求技术人员认真研究一下为什么有时加水好有时又不好的问题。这个问题的提出，像开了一扇窗子，于是开始了加水试验。
    郑司长、矿口的干部和冶金工业部的李工程师等技术人员，同工人一起在七号过滤机上作试验。经过试验，摸清了工人们迷惑不解的问题。原来，要使加水收到效果，必须根据一定的矿浆浓度；过去所以加水有时好有时不好，就是因矿浆浓度和真空度不同。根据试验所找到的规律，订出了一套操作规程，推广了加水的经验。
    在总结和推广加水经验的前后，干部、技术人员同工人又一起总结和推广补过滤布（过滤布有时出现洞孔，用针线缝补）等经验。这样一来，精矿含水量从过去15％左右降到13％左右；产量由原来的一千多吨提高到两千吨以上。职工们正想在这个基础上组织高产战役，不想真空泵又出了问题。本来应该由离心泵送回精矿浓缩池里的滤液，却被真空泵连泥带水吸了进去。真空泵有了泥水，不但容易损坏设备，而且也影响它抽出过滤机的水。真是一关刚过，又遇一关。
    为了解决这个新的问题，干部、技术人员和工人，都整天整夜找原因、想办法。检修工人守在机器旁，出了毛病马上就修。董庆臣、张志民等许多工人还组织了一个“破关小组”，逐个检查设备。
    干部、工人和技术人员经过多次试验研究，发现由过滤机吸到水汽分离器里的滤液，离心泵不能及时抽完，是因为真空泵和离心泵能力不平衡：离心泵能力小，本来应该由离心泵抽走的滤液，却被力量大的真空泵吸了过去。怎样增加离心泵的能力？有人主张采纳谢起良、姚升官等老工人的意见：把水汽分离器由现在的卧式改为立式。很早以前，谢起良等老工人就提出了这项建议，但当时有人却说有的选矿厂用了这种办法，效果并不好，所以一直没有采纳。一阵热烈争辩，一些技术人员认为老谢等工人的建议有道理；但是把卧式改为立式，虽然距真空泵高了些，能力恐怕还不够；经过郑司长等领导干部和工程技术人员的反复研究，决定把水汽分离器搬到楼上，这样距离就会更高些。搬到楼上一台进行试验的结果，效果十分好。接着，工人们只用了三天时间，就把全矿二十六台水汽分离器全部搬到了楼上。从这以后，离心泵能力不够的问题解决了，全矿精矿含水量一直在13％以下，日产量由二千多吨上升到五千多吨。
    现在，烧结车间的工人们又敲锣打鼓地送来了大字报。不过这回不是批评而是祝贺。过滤工段的工人见了人再也不低头了，老谢迈起步子也比过去更有劲了。小董等一些工人现在参加了党；张志民等青年工人入了团。但是，职工们谁也没有把功劳归在自己身上，他们都说：这是党提出的“三结合”的胜利。（附图片）
