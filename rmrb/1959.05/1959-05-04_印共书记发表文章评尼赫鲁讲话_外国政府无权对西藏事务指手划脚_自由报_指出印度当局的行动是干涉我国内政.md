Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd - The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly published an article on its front page by Ranadive, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, entitled "Indo-Chinese Friendship Must Not Be Allowed to Suffer," which commented on Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the situation in Tibet in the People's House on April 27.

Ranadive wrote that Prime Minister Nehru's speech "shows that in recent weeks there has been a sharp deterioration in Indo-Chinese relations. This development is welcomed by the imperialists and has caused serious concern among freedom-loving people of all countries in Asia."

Ranadive wrote: "The whole gist of his (Nehru's) speech shows that he believes that the 'other party' is primarily responsible for the current situation." Ranadive pointed out in the article that people "find it difficult to agree with this conclusion (of Nehru's)." He said, "It was not the Chinese who started it. It was some members of the Indian Parliament who launched violent attacks on China, and China was called an aggressor trying to suppress a small country."

Ranadive asked: "When the Chinese government is attacked as an aggressor and accused by the Indian Prime Minister of engaging in deception, shouldn't the Chinese feel unhappy?"

Ranadive said, "The statement issued in the name of the Dalai Lama is itself violent in this regard. It is extremely inappropriate for Indian government officials to distribute this statement."

He said, "The Indian government believes that the 1951 agreement (on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet) was not sincere but was concluded at the point of a bayonet. We still need to clarify this matter, because this is not India's attitude, and India believes that this agreement is valid, so it is a big mistake for any official to distribute this statement. This statement is virtually more or less abandoning the 1951 agreement and demanding that Tibet secede from China and become independent. People cannot allow anyone to rely on India's support, using autonomy as a pretext, to snatch Tibet away from China." He continued, "If our attitude is that Tibet is a part of China, then our government cannot provide even indirect support for claims for independence and secession. Some people with ulterior motives in India are trying to play tricks, equating autonomy with independence. This attitude is an unreasonable interference in China's internal affairs."

He said: "Tibet has autonomy under the leadership of the central government, which does not mean that foreign governments can interfere in the issue of autonomy in Tibet. This is a fundamental mistake that no one should make." He pointed out that even some official statements of the Indian government "reveal obvious political prejudice, unilaterally recognizing the stories of the rebels, and unilaterally denying everything the Chinese say, including the authenticity of the letters written by the Dalai Lama."

He said: "Those who take up arms against the government, those who kill people and government workers for the benefit of serfdom and reactionaries, are declared innocent and elevated to the status of 'leaders of national uprisings.' Private organizations and individuals are undoubtedly free to express their views on world affairs. However, no government can welcome a rebellion in a friendly country as a national uprising and escape the condemnation of interfering in internal affairs."

He concluded: "Tibet will certainly move towards socialism, and Indians should not shed tears for this. The vast majority of our people will welcome the dawn of socialism and economic freedom in this glorious ancient land, and can only feel sorry for those who try to oppose socialism in the name of Buddhism."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd - The Indian "Epoch Times" commented on Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the situation in Tibet in the People's House on April 27, saying, "Nehru vehemently condemned China, but has he considered India's future policies and the direction of the international cold war? As Sino-Indian relations become increasingly complex, Nehru will become increasingly involved in this complex situation. Therefore, we feel uneasy about the future."

The newspaper said that no one who is smart and has a brain would be happy about the deterioration of Sino-Indian relations. It pointed out that "India's recent future will be further endangered by being unfriendly to China." The newspaper hoped to end this unpleasant and uneasy situation as soon as possible.

The newspaper also welcomed the hopeful tone in the resolution of the meeting of the National People's Congress of China, and hoped that the Dalai Lama could return to Tibet, but it expressed doubts about the news that the Chinese side had discovered some documents regarding the Tibetan rebellion.

The "Freedom Daily," published by the Communist Party of India in Calcutta, published an editorial on April 29 commenting on Nehru's speech in the People's House, saying, "There is no doubt that as a result of Prime Minister Nehru's speech, the relationship between India and China has become further complicated. The masses of India will feel deeply disturbed about this."

The newspaper said, "We know that great China is faithful to the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) and opposes interference in the internal affairs of other countries. No one has ever seen the Chinese government behave inconsistently." The newspaper pointed out, however, "The Tibetan issue has been created in the Indian Parliament, and some people have criticized China's policies in Tibet. India is granting asylum to traitors. If these actions do not constitute interference in the internal affairs of another country, then what other actions can be considered interference in the internal affairs of another country?"

The newspaper said, "Imperialists and reactionary forces have been engaged in the plot to separate Tibet from China. They want to make this conspiracy succeed now, but they have failed. Nehru, however, expressed moral support for these rebels and this rebellion. Why did the Indian Prime Minister forget imperialism?"

The newspaper said, "The people of India and China, two great countries, have had painful experiences with imperialist exploitation and conspiracies, which is why they hope to maintain an unbreakable friendship. They are determined to protect this friendship like protecting their eyeballs."

The newspaper asked: "Why does Nehru presumptuously attempt to offer opinions to great China on the national rights and autonomy of the Tibetan people? Even a fool would not say that Nehru can understand the meaning of defending national rights and autonomy, because in his own country he calls the warriors fighting to defend the national rights of the Marathi, Gujarati, and Bengali people bad people and expresses anger towards them. Isn't it a very presumptuous expression of Nehru to offer opinions to the Chinese leaders who unite 600 million people of all ethnic groups and successfully make all ethnic groups develop rapidly?"

The newspaper asked: "Why has Nehru, an important spokesman for Panchsheel, begun to express anger towards China? He must know that in the settlement of the Tibetan issue, he will have no chance to intervene because it is China's internal affair. However, he is inciting the reactionaries in India to realize an imperialist conspiracy. There is only one political reason for doing so: the Indian people are quickly being attracted by the example of China's socialist progress."

### 印共书记发表文章评尼赫鲁讲话  外国政府无权对西藏事务指手划脚  “自由报”指出印度当局的行动是干涉我国内政

    印共书记发表文章评尼赫鲁讲话
    外国政府无权对西藏事务指手划脚
    “自由报”指出印度当局的行动是干涉我国内政
    新华社新德里3日电　最近一期的“新世纪”周报在头版上刊载了印度共产党书记处书记兰那地夫写的一篇题为“必须不让印中友谊受到损害”的文章，文章评论了尼赫鲁总理4月27日在人民院就西藏局势发表的讲话。
    兰那地夫写道，尼赫鲁总理的这篇讲话“表明最近几星期来印中关系发生了剧烈的恶化。这种发展受到帝国主义者的欢迎，而引起了整个亚洲爱好自由的各国人民的严重忧虑。”
    兰那地夫写道：“他（指尼赫鲁）的讲话的整个要旨表明，他认为，要对目前局势负主要责任的是‘对方’。”兰那地夫在文章中指出，人们“很难同意（尼赫鲁的）这个结论”。他说，“开头的并不是中国人。那是在印度议会中一些议员对中国进行了狂暴的攻击，中国被称为试图镇压一个小国的侵略者。”
    兰那地夫问道：“当中国人的政府被人攻击为侵略者，并且被印度总理指责为进行欺骗，难道中国人不应当感到不快吗？”
    兰那地夫说，“以达赖喇嘛的名义发表的声明本身在这方面是凶暴的。由印度政府官员散发这项声明，是极其不恰当的。”
    他说，“印度政府认为，1951年（关于和平解放西藏的办法）的协议并不是真诚的，而是在刺刀尖下缔结的，这件事我们还要弄清楚。因为这不是印度的态度，而且印度认为这个协议是有效的，所以由任何官员来散发这项声明是大错特错了。这项声明实际上是或多或少地在废弃1951年的协议，要求西藏脱离中国而独立。人们不能允许任何人依靠印度的支持，以自治为口实，把西藏从中国那里抢走。”他继续说，“如果我们的态度是：西藏是中国的一部分，那么，我们的政府不能对要求独立和脱离的主张提供甚至是间接的支持。印度某些别有用心的人企图变戏法，把自治和独立等同起来。这种态度是对中国内政的无理干涉。”
    他说：“西藏在中央政府领导下有自治权，这并不意味着外国政府可以在西藏实行自治的问题上指手划脚。这是一个任何人都不应该犯的根本性的错误。”他指出，甚至印度政府的一些正式声明也“露出了明显的政治偏见，单方面承认叛乱分子的故事，单方面否认中国人所说的一切，包括达赖喇嘛所写的信件的真实性。”
    他说：“那些拿起武器来反对政府的人，那些为了农奴制度和反动派的利益而杀害人民和政府工作人员的人，被宣布是无罪的，并且被抬高身价，说成是‘领导民族起义’的。私人组织和个人无疑是可以自由地表示他们对世界大事的看法的。但是，没有一个政府可以把一个友好国家中发生的叛乱当作是民族起义来欢迎，而又能够逃避干涉内政的谴责。”
    他最后说：“西藏肯定将向社会主义前进，印度人不应该为这件事流泪。绝大多数的我国人民将会欢迎在这块光荣的古老的土地上出现社会主义和经济自由的曙光，而对那些以佛教为名设法反对社会主义的人只能感到遗憾。”
    新华社新德里3日电　印度“划时代报”在4月30日评论尼赫鲁总理4月27日在人民院就西藏局势发表的讲话时说，“尼赫鲁猛烈地责难中国，但是他有没有考虑到印度将来的政策和国际冷战的方向？中印关系变得愈来愈复杂，尼赫鲁就会愈来愈多地同这种复杂的局势有牵连。因此，我们对前途感到不安。”
    这家报纸说，没有一个聪明的、有头脑的人对于印中关系恶化会感到高兴的。它指出，“印度最近的前途将会由于对中国不友好而进一步遭到危险。”这家报纸希望及早结束这种令人不愉快和不安的局面。
    这家报纸还表示欢迎中国全国人民代表大会会议的决议中的抱有希望的语调，并且希望达赖喇嘛可以回到西藏，但是它对于中国方面又发现了一些关于西藏叛乱的文件的消息表示怀疑。
    印度共产党在加尔各答出版的“自由报”4月29日发表社论评论尼赫鲁在人民院的讲话说，“毫无疑问，由于尼赫鲁总理发表了这次讲话，印度和中国之间的关系进一步复杂化了。印度的群众对此将深深感到不安。”
    报纸说，“我们知道，伟大的中国忠实于潘查希拉（和平共处五项原则），反对干涉其他国家的内政，没有人曾经看到中国政府有过任何言行不一的表现。”这家报纸指出，但是，“在印度议会中却制造了西藏问题，有人对中国在西藏所采取的政策进行责难，印度正在给予叛国分子以避难权，如果这些行动不是对另一个国家内政的干涉，那么还有别的什么行动才算是对另一个国家内政的干涉呢？”
    报纸说，“帝国主义者和反动力量一直在进行使西藏脱离中国的勾当。他们想在现在使这个阴谋成功，但是他们失败了。尼赫鲁却对这些叛乱分子和这次叛乱表示了道义上的支持。印度总理为什么忘记了帝国主义呢？”
    这家报纸说，“印度和中国这两个伟大的国家的人民对于帝国主义的剥削和阴谋都有过惨痛的经验，这就是他们希望保持牢不可破的友谊的原因。他们决心像保护他们的眼珠那样保护这种友谊。”
    报纸问道：“为什么尼赫鲁妄自尊大地企图对伟大的中国提出关于西藏人的民族权利和自治的意见？甚至傻瓜也不会说尼赫鲁能够懂得保卫民族权利和自治的意义，因为他在自己的国内把为保卫马拉提人、古吉拉特人、孟加拉人的民族权利而斗争的战士叫做坏人，并且向他们表示愤怒。尼赫鲁向团结着六亿各族人民并且成功地使各民族飞快发展的中国领导人提出意见，这不是他十分妄自尊大的表现吗？”
    这家报纸问道：“像尼赫鲁这样一位潘查希拉的重要发言人为什么会开始对中国表示愤怒？他一定知道，在西藏问题的解决上，他将没有机会插一手，因为这是中国的内政，然而，他正在鼓动印度的反动派来实现一个帝国主义的阴谋。这样做只有一个政治上的原因：印度人民正在很快地被中国的社会主义进展的榜样所吸引过去。”
