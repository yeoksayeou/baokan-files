    Let Young Teachers Stand on the Platform
    Xue Ya
    With the development of China's education, more and more young teachers will be stepping onto the platform, which is a sign of the prosperity and flourishing of the education cause.
    In the past year, China's education has developed rapidly, with higher education expanding sixfold. As education develops, the teaching staff must be correspondingly strengthened, and more young teachers must stand on the platform to share the responsibility of teaching with older teachers. At the same time, young teachers can only constantly train and improve themselves in teaching practice and gradually become proficient. Isn't this how every older teacher has been trained? And only when older teachers have a younger generation to share some of the teaching tasks can they free up more time to improve their cultivation and better pass on their experience to young teachers, making the country's teaching staff even stronger.
    Can young teachers teach well? This is what students care about. Yes, young teachers have less teaching experience. However, they have all received considerable education and have been selected, and some have undergone a period of preparation and internship. As long as they prepare their lessons well in advance and listen to the opinions of older teachers and students afterward, constantly improving themselves, they can accumulate considerable experience in a short period. Currently, many young teachers are very responsible, modest, and energetic in their teaching, and have good relationships with students, which is a very good phenomenon.
    Now, Beijing Normal University and other schools are paying attention to helping young teachers in cultivating and improving teachers. They have come up with various methods: older teachers lead young teachers forward; students and young teachers teach each other, helping each other; the Party committee tries to improve the political and ideological level of young teachers. In cultivating and educating young teachers, they have organized the entire teaching staff. Older and young teachers work together, organized like an orchestra. New and old teachers teach students well together and improve together. This is precisely the new scene after the great leap forward in education last year. This new atmosphere may enable the new teaching staff to continue to grow and the quality of teaching to continuously improve.
    Letting young teachers stand on the platform is an important task in developing China's education. It is recommended that all schools attach importance to and study this issue, and effectively solve it.

    让青年教师上讲台
    薛雅
    随着我国教育事业的发展，将有越来越多的青年教师走上讲台，这是教育事业兴盛繁荣的景象。
    去年一年，我国教育事业发展很快，仅高等学校就发展了六倍。教育事业发展了，就必须相应地壮大教师队伍，就必然要有更多的青年教师登上讲台，同老教师共同负担教学的责任。同时，青年教师只有在教学实践中，才能不断地锻炼和提高自己，慢慢地熟练起来，每一个老教师不都是这样锻炼出来的吗？而老教师也只有有了年轻的一代来分担一部分教学任务后，才可以抽出更多时间来提高修养，并把他们的经验更好地传给青年教师，让祖国的教师队伍更加壮大。
    青年教师能教好课吗？这是学生关心的事。是的，青年教师的教学经验少一些。但是，他们都是受过相当的教育，经过挑选出来的人员，有的还经过一段准备和实习。只要他们事前能很好地备课，事后能多听听老教师和学生的意见，不断提高自己，用不了多久，就可以积累起相当的经验来。目前，很多青年教师在教学中很负责，虚心，干劲大，师生关系好，这是十分良好的现象。
    现在，北京师范大学和其他学校在培养和提高教师中，注意到对青年教师的帮助。他们想出各种办法：老教师带领青年教师前进；学生和青年教师教学相长，互相帮助；党委设法提高青年教师政治思想水平。他们在培养和教育青年教师中，把整个教师队伍组织起来了。老教师和青年教师一齐发挥作用，组织得就像一个乐队一样。新老教师共同教好学生，共同提高。这正是去年教育大跃进后的崭新景象，这种新气象就有可能使新的教师队伍不断成长，教学质量不断提高。
    让青年教师上讲台，这是发展我国教育事业的重要任务，建议各个学校重视和研究这个问题，并有效地解决这个问题。
