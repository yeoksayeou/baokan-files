    Award Certificate
    In the bright and clean workshop of the 13th Workshop of the Jinxi Machine Factory in Taiyuan, among the quarterly advanced team award certificates, a new and eye-catching award certificate has recently been added. This award certificate is surrounded by colorful borders, with the four characters "携手前进" ("Moving Forward Hand in Hand") written horizontally in the center. There is an exceptionally moving story behind the origin of this award certificate.
    This workshop is responsible for the complete production of electric motors and generators. There are two outstanding teams in the workshop: the Qin Baozhong team and the Gao Wuhai team. One team is proficient in planning, milling, planing, and drilling, producing parts for generators and electric motors; the other is all-around in stamping and welding. In the first quarter, the two teams launched a heated technical innovation competition, helping each other and overcoming difficulties together. They had already completed eight months of production tasks and became the "model workers" of the entire workshop. The mirror with the colored borders was a gift from the Gao Wuhai team to the Qin Baozhong team.
    Before and After the "Temple Fair"
    Why did the Gao Wuhai team give a mirror to the Qin Baozhong team?
    The two teams led by Qin Baozhong and Gao Wuhai had been neck and neck in a competition since last year. By the end of the year, they had both won the title of advanced team in the entire workshop for two quarters. At the beginning of this year, the production tasks of the entire workshop exceeded several times last year, and many products had never been produced before. For example, the 1,500 kW steam turbine generator parts were diverse in variety and large in quantity. They were in a stage of trial production and actual production simultaneously. With such a large production task, and all urgently needed by key national enterprises, how to ensure timely assembly and delivery became a major concern for these two Communist Party members.
    "We need to speed up technological revolution and also urgently need to mobilize the masses to carry out competitions!" This common understanding was quickly reflected in their actions. In early February, before other production teams had even started, the competition between these two teams quietly began. After the competition began, Old Qin took the lead and successfully converted the shaping machine into a high-speed vertical milling machine. Originally, it was biting one cut at a time, but now it was whirring around, dramatically increasing efficiency by more than tenfold.
    This innovation caused a sensation throughout the workshop. The technical innovation movement in the entire workshop quickly unfolded. The Gao Wuhai team also developed a plan to learn from and catch up with the advanced. By the end of February, 60% of the more than 100 innovation proposals put forward by their team had been put into production. At this time, they overtook the Qin Baozhong team. On March 23, the workshop's Party general branch held a technical innovation "Temple Fair" at the Gao Wuhai team. The "exhibits" of the Qin Baozhong team also participated in this exhibition.
    After the "Temple Fair," a technical innovation movement to learn from and catch up with the advanced swept through the entire workshop. Everyone used the experience of the Gao Wuhai team to discuss and revise their own plans and find practical measures. However, in the Qin Baozhong team, another question was being hotly debated: how to support the Gao Wuhai team in maintaining its red flag.
    Communist Party member Qin Baozhong is an old turner with twenty years of experience. After the "Temple Fair," he was so excited that he couldn't sleep for several nights. He thought: The workshop really needs to establish a banner, just like a machine needs a motor. Without a banner, the movement cannot be carried out, and there is no guarantee of completing the task. We must help the Gao Wuhai team to maintain its red flag.
    At the debate, some workers proposed to overwhelm the Gao Wuhai team. Old Qin knew what he was talking about and said, "We are carrying out the competition to complete the task. The Gao Wuhai team still has many advantages worth learning from." A young worker said, "As long as we put in some effort, we don't have to worry about surpassing them. Why should we learn from them?" Some workers even opposed supporting advanced teams, fearing that their own teams would be compared and appear even shorter. Qin Baozhong listened quietly to the workers' discussion and then said, "Everyone likes to be an advanced pacesetter. However, we also have a responsibility to establish pacesetters and cultivate advanced models. We must catch up with him, support him, and help him. In this way, he will always be leading, everyone will always be catching up with him, and won't the production of the entire workshop be completed even better?" At the end of the discussion, their slogan was: "Learn from Gao Wuhai, catch up with Gao Wuhai, and vigorously support Gao Wuhai."
    Opponents, But Also Assistants
    The competition between the Qin Baozhong and Gao Wuhai teams became even more heated because of new content. At the beginning of March, in the Qin Baozhong team, the workers were rushing to process generator parts, preparing to complete the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule. Old Qin, however, took on a batch of collaborative tasks—the twenty-eight steam turbine generator underframes of the Gao Wuhai team. Some workers muttered: Collaboration is okay, but we're already working on the July tasks now.
    "Even if our team completes several years' worth of tasks, it doesn't mean that the entire workshop has completed the production of machine parts," Old Qin patiently persuaded. "In our factory, one team and another team, one workshop and another workshop, are inextricably linked. Many of our team's tasks also require the help of other teams. Only in this way can we ensure that the tasks of our entire workshop are completed on time and guarantee assembly."
    Old Qin's words left a deep impression on the minds of these young people. The workers not only made the twenty-eight steam turbine generator underframes but also pushed the cooperation between the two teams to a new peak. Usually, as long as workers brought work, even the team leader didn't know, they would solve the problem. Once, the Gao Wuhai team wanted to install an automatic pull rod on the punch press. The workers of the Old Qin team even forgot to eat and helped them install it. Sometimes, in order to help the Gao Wuhai team realize innovation proposals, Old Qin would squat next to the machine for half a day, working with the workers to come up with ideas and find solutions. The Gao Wuhai team was also equally active in helping others. Sometimes, if the Old Qin team needed some welding work, the welders of the Gao Wuhai team would carry the welding machine and the oxygen cylinder to help. If the Old Qin team needed to use oxygen to cut the raw materials, they would simply send the raw materials from the warehouse to the Gao Wuhai team and bring them back after they were cut. In this way, in the first quarter, the Qin Baozhong team collaborated with other teams for more than four thousand hours; the Gao Wuhai team collaborated with other teams for more than forty thousand pieces.
    A Gift
    On March 30, the Jinxi Machine Factory held a congress of Party members. Prior to this, each workshop launched a vigorous upsurge of gift-giving competition.
    One day, Gao Wuhai and Gao Hongcai, among others, discovered a screw-threading machine at the Heavy Machinery Factory, which was more than ten times more efficient than the tap used by the Qin Baozhong team. Gao Wuhai thought: The screws processed by the Qin Baozhong team are the key to the production of the entire workshop. It would be much faster to have such a device. He suggested going back to imitate one and give it to the Qin Baozhong team as a gift for the Party member congress. So, the three of them measured the dimensions and recorded the structure. When they returned, they looked everywhere for scrap materials and started trial production. However, making this thread rolling machine required the use of lathes, milling machines, and drilling machines, so they had to seek cooperation from Old Qin.
    The Qin Baozhong team was also really busy. In addition to rushing to improve a multi-head drill in preparation for the gift, they also arranged the progress of each person's technological innovations. At this time, there were only three days left before the convening of the Party member congress. Gao Wuhai told Qin Baozhong about the difficulties they had in completing the gift. Old Qin thought: The Gao Wuhai team's gift is related to the production of the entire workshop and is more important than their own. He said straightforwardly, "Bring it here! According to our team's task, improving the multi-head drill is the first; according to the entire workshop, your thread rolling machine is the first." The workers of the Qin Baozhong team thought of many ways, drew machines and people to do this work. The rest of the people rushed to produce tasks and trial-produced multi-head drills. Finally, both items were completed.
    At the end of the factory's Party representative conference, the two teams had already entered the production of August by leaps and bounds. At the first quarter's workshop's advanced team selection meeting, the workers of the Gao Wuhai team carried an award certificate with the words "Moving Forward Hand in Hand" written on it and presented it to the Qin Baozhong team.

    奖状
    在太原晋西机器厂十三车间的明净的厂房里，在车间季度先进小组奖状的中间，最近新添了一块引人注目的奖状。这个奖状四周镶着彩色的花边，正中横写着“携手前进”四个大字。这个奖状的来历，有一段异常动人的故事。
    这个车间担负着整套的电动机和发电机的生产任务。车间里有两个出色的小组：秦保忠小组和高武海小组。这两个组，一个是插、铣、刨、钻样样全，生产发电机和电动机的零件；另一个是冲压、焊接的全能。在第一季度里，两个组展开了热烈的技术革新竞赛，并且相互帮助，共同克服困难，都已经完成了八个月的生产任务，成了全车间的“标兵”。那块镶着花边的镜子，就是高武海小组送给秦保忠小组的。
    “庙会”前后
    高武海小组为什么送面镜子给秦保忠小组呢？
    秦保忠和高武海领导的两个小组，从去年起就是你追我赶地扭着一股劲，到年底他们都取得了两个季度的全车间先进小组的称号。今年一开始，全车间的生产任务超过了去年几倍，而且许多产品是过去没有生产过的。如一千五百瓩的汽轮发电机零件，品种多、数量大，他们是边试制、边生产。这样大的生产任务，又都是国家重点企业所急需的，如何保证按时装配出厂，成了这两个共产党员心里的一桩大事。
    “需要快点搞技术革命，也急需把群众发动起来开展竞赛！”他们这个共同的认识，很快就表现在行动上了。2月初，其他生产小组还没有动，这两个小组的竞赛就默默地开始了。竞赛开始后，老秦一马当先，成功地把牛头刨改成了高速立铣车，原来一刀刀地啃，一下就成了哗啦啦转，效率猛地提高了十多倍。
    这个革新轰动了全车间。全车间的技术革新运动很快开展起来。高武海小组也订出了学先进赶先进的计划。到2月下旬，他们小组提出的一百多件革新建议就有60％都用到生产上。这时，他们赶过了秦保忠小组。3月23日，车间党总支在高武海小组举办了一次技术革新“庙会”。这次展览中，也有秦保忠小组参加的“展品”。
    “庙会”以后，一个学先进赶先进的技术革新运动席卷了整个车间，大家都以高武海小组的经验，讨论修订自己的计划和寻找切实的措施。可是在秦保忠小组里，却热烈地辩论着另一个问题：如何支持高武海小组保持红旗。
    共产党员秦保忠是个已有二十年工龄的老车工。“庙会”以后，他兴奋得几夜睡不好觉。他想：车间里很需要树起个旗帜来，就像机器需要马达一样，没有旗帜，运动就开展不起来，完成任务就没有把握。一定要帮助高武海小组把红旗保持下去。
    辩论会上，有的工人却提出要压倒高武海。老秦心里有底，他说：“我们开展竞赛是为了完成任务，高武海小组许多优点还是值得我们学习的。”一个青年工人说：“我们只要鼓鼓劲，不愁超过他们，为什么还学习他们呢？”甚至有的工人反对支持先进小组，怕把自己小组比得更矮了。秦保忠静静地听着工人们的讨论，然后说：“谁也喜欢当先进的标兵。但是，我们也都有责任树立标兵，培养先进的典型。我们要一面赶他，一面支持他、帮助他，这样，他一直领先，大家一直赶他，全车间的生产不是就能完成得更好吗？”讨论结束的时候，他们提出的口号是：“学习高武海、赶上高武海、大力支持高武海。”
    是对手，也是助手
    秦保忠和高武海两个小组的竞赛，因为有了新的内容，开展得更加热火朝天了。3月初，在秦保忠小组里，工人们正在赶着发电机零件的加工任务，准备提前完成第一季度的生产计划。老秦却揽回了一批协作任务——高武海小组的二十八件汽轮发电机的底架。有的工人就嘟囔开了：协作是可以，可现在我们要做7月份的活了。
    “即使我们小组完成几年的任务，也不等于整个车间完成了机器零件生产任务。”老秦耐心地劝导说，“在我们厂里，一个小组和一个小组，一个车间和一个车间，是千丝万缕地联系着的，我们小组好多任务也都要别的组帮助才行。只有这样，才会使我们全车间的任务，按时完成，保证装配。”
    老秦的一番话，在这些青年的心里留下了很深的印象。工人们不但制成了二十八件汽轮发电机的底架，而且使两个组的协作又推向一个新的高峰。平时，只要工人们带着活儿来，连组长也不知道，他们就把问题解决了。有一次，高武海小组想把冲床上加装个自动拉杆，老秦小组的工人们连饭也没顾得吃，就帮助他们装上了。有时候，老秦为帮助高武海小组实现革新建议，半天半天地蹲在机器旁边，和工人们一道出主意、想办法。高武海小组也同样积极帮助别人。有时候，老秦小组需要有点什么焊接的活，高武海小组的电焊工人就背上电焊机，扛上氧气瓶，跑来帮忙。老秦小组需要用氧气裁开原料，就干脆从仓库把原料送到高武海小组，裁好后才拿回来。就这样，在第一季度里，秦保忠小组共对外协作四千多个小时；高武海小组对外协作四万多件。
    献礼
    3月30日，晋西机器厂召开党员代表大会。在这以前，各车间掀起了轰轰烈烈的献礼竞赛热潮。
    有一天，高武海和高鸿才等三人在重型机器厂发现了个绞螺丝的机器，比他们平时在秦保忠小组见到的用搬牙绞丝口效率要高十多倍。高武海心想：秦保忠小组加工的螺丝，是全车间生产的关键，要有这样一个家伙可就快多了。他建议回去仿做一个，送给秦保忠小组，并作为他们给党员代表大会的献礼。于是，三个人就量了尺寸，记下了构造。回来，他们就到处找废料，动手试制。可是，制这台辊丝机，却要用元车、铣车和钻床，又得找老秦协作。
    秦保忠小组也真够忙的。他们除了赶着改进一个多头钻准备献礼外，在技术革新上也安排了各人实现的进度。这时，离党员代表大会的召开只有三天了，高武海把他们完成献礼的困难告诉了秦保忠。老秦想：高武海小组的这件献礼，关系到整个车间的生产，比自己的重要，他就直截了当地说：“拿来吧！按我们小组的任务说，改多头钻是第一；按整个车间说，你们的辊丝机是第一。”秦保忠小组的工人想了许多办法，抽出机器和人来做这件活。其余的人突击生产任务和试制多头钻。最后终于两项都完成了。
    厂党代表大会结束的时候，这两个小组都已经大踏步地进入了8月份的生产。第一季度车间评选先进小组的大会上，高武海小组的工人抬着写有“携手前进”的奖状，送给了秦保忠小组。
