Implementing the Party's Education Policy and Promoting Teaching Work
Speech by Representative Wang Yousheng

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and other reports. I work in the Electrical Engineering Department of Zhejiang University. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of combining education with productive labor, our school has actively implemented this policy and has achieved great results. Now, I would like to report to the congress on a few experiences of our Electrical Engineering Department, mainly the Electrical Engineering major, in the practice of implementing the Party's policy.

Chairman Mao instructed: "Our education policy should enable those who receive education to develop in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." This policy clearly tells us that the purpose of education is to cultivate laborers who can engage in both physical and mental labor, and who have both socialist consciousness and culture. According to this policy, there are many problems with the content of the original textbooks in our major. In recent years, China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry and its production technology level have been continuously developing, but this has not been adequately reflected in major courses such as "Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Technology" and "Electrical Machinery Design." The description of many problems is generalized. Socialist economic construction guidelines and policies are rarely implemented in teaching activities. Teachers generally lack systematic practical production knowledge, and their lectures are not sufficiently connected to reality, especially regarding process structure issues. For example, the processing of motor bases must ensure that the various circular surfaces are concentric. This is a very important issue in the process, referred to as "concentricity" in process technology. It is difficult to explain clearly without going deep into the site. When selecting structural dimensions or determining processing dimensions in course design, different teachers often have different answers, or even cannot answer at all.

Regarding this situation, most teachers and students are eager to change and want to combine theoretical knowledge from books with rich production knowledge by participating in productive labor. However, a few people are satisfied with the status quo. They emphasize that higher education institutions are for training theoretical design talents, and training process manufacturing talents is the task of secondary technical schools. Or they emphasize that learning in school only requires basic theoretical knowledge, and production knowledge can only be "processed" in factories after graduation. Under the influence of this thinking, some people look down on production, are seriously detached from production and reality, and spend all day going in circles in books. Through studying the Party's education policy and repeated debates, a preliminary consensus was reached. We saw that the socialist construction of the motherland is progressing rapidly, and the need for talents in various fields is extremely urgent. If the students we train in higher industrial schools know nothing about production, then education loses its purpose. However, some people still have doubts about whether participating in productive labor can improve teaching quality. Facts are the best proof. Over the past year, we have set up factories and worked in factories, especially in the past two months, we organized 70 teachers and senior students to go to Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory and Xiaoshan Electric Machinery Factory in Zhejiang for teaching practice, participating in productive labor, conducting on-site teaching, and collecting data to compile teaching materials. We have achieved relatively significant results in linking theory with practice. By going deep into the site, with physical objects in front of us, lectures and practical operations are carried out simultaneously, and many problems that were difficult to explain clearly and thoroughly in the past in the classroom are now easily understood. During our internship in the factory, everyone sought teachers and friends everywhere, seeking "experience" and "treasures," and thus gained very rich production knowledge. At the same time, we also purposefully read hundreds of books and materials from home and abroad, repeatedly conducted research and discussions, and collectively wrote a draft of 500,000 words of "Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Technology" teaching materials. Compared with the past textbooks, this teaching material is much richer in content. For example, the manufacturing process of important products such as steam turbine generators, hydro generators, DC motors, and motors are explained and analyzed item by item according to different types and processes, covering their process, manufacturing methods, production equipment, and product inspection, which is a great step forward compared to the past textbooks that only talked about general principles. The transformer manufacturing process, which was not described in the past textbooks, has also been added. In particular, many technological innovation achievements of these two factories during the Great Leap Forward last year, such as indigenous continuous insulation treatment, small equipment processing of steam turbine generator base, etc., have also been incorporated into the teaching materials. Through compiling the teaching materials, the students extracted and analyzed the production knowledge they gained, integrated it, and had a deeper understanding, and improved their independent working ability. Some students said: "In the past, graduates were afraid of going to the workshop and afraid of doing process work. Now we are not afraid." An old professor said: "For decades, because theory was divorced from reality, I increasingly felt that I had reached the end of my road. Now, by implementing the Party's education policy, contacting production, and contacting reality, I have learned a lot of knowledge and learning from practice. It is like a new village appearing after passing through a dark willow patch." This shows that the view that students can only learn knowledge in the classroom and from books, and that teachers only need to "read widely" to give good lectures is obviously wrong. The fact of compiling teaching materials forcefully proves that workers are not only the creators of material wealth, but also the creators of scientific culture; proving that production practice is an inexhaustible source of theoretical knowledge. Therefore, any view that participating in productive labor will reduce teaching quality is groundless. In order to better cultivate well-rounded talents who serve socialist construction, we must conscientiously implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, and earnestly achieve the integration of theory with practice. This is the fundamental line of socialist and communist education.

Implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor not only enriches practical production knowledge and improves theoretical analysis capabilities, but also vigorously promotes scientific research work. In the past, scientific research work in universities was not very common. Only a few people conducted research behind closed doors in a cold and lonely manner. Many of the research topics were chosen based on personal interests or determined for personal purposes. With the development needs of socialist economic construction, scientific research work has greatly developed, especially after the implementation of the Party's education policy last year, scientific research work has taken a big step forward. Many problems raised in production that are combined with professional teaching are important topics and contents of our scientific research. Taking the Electrical Engineering Department of our school as an example, the research projects completed from March to December last year were thirteen times that of the previous eight years. Many of these projects have played a certain role in improving production methods, improving equipment utilization, improving product quality, saving raw materials, and creating new products. Furthermore, scientific research work itself is a process of practice and improvement. In the process of scientific research, many problems are often encountered that require rich practical production knowledge to solve. For example, last year our Electrical Engineering Department encountered various technical problems such as vacuum pumping, high-temperature special welding, vacuum spraying, and alloy electroplating in a scientific research project; this year, we also encountered epoxy resin usage technical problems in another scientific research project. Because we have basically learned and mastered these relevant production technical knowledge, this scientific research work can be carried out. However, our production technical knowledge and material conditions are still much worse compared to factories. Therefore, schools must combine with factories and enterprises in scientific research work, and must obtain the cooperation of factories. Without the assistance of factories both inside and outside the school, most of our scientific research work would be impossible. We deeply realize that resolutely implementing the Party's education policy is the fundamental driving force for universities to carry out scientific research; and the result of correctly carrying out scientific research is directly beneficial to the development of production, and it also enriches teaching content, helps to systematically and deeply grasp theoretical and practical knowledge, and cultivates the independent working ability of teachers and students, thereby comprehensively improving teaching quality. It is very important to recognize the dialectical relationship of mutual integration and mutual promotion between carrying out scientific research and improving teaching quality and promoting production and construction. Otherwise, the bourgeois scholars' views and methods of engaging in scientific research behind closed doors, detached from reality, and for the sake of personal fame and gain or satisfying personal interests are contrary to the fundamental principles of our current scientific research work.

Through productive labor, the ideological outlook of teachers and students has also undergone significant changes. Whether participating in productive labor in factories, helping with rush harvesting and planting in rural areas, or participating in various voluntary labor activities and cadres going down to the grassroots, we can eat, live, and work with workers and farmers, have a relatively correct view of physical labor, and strengthen the concept of labor. The soaring revolutionary spirit of workers and farmers is a very profound communist education for us. In order to complete production tasks, they sometimes do not leave the workshop or field for days and nights, working hard with a serious and responsible attitude and all their efforts. Production targets are repeatedly broken, which truly makes us see the noble qualities of workers and peasants. Many people said that they must put down their airs, learn from workers and peasants, transform themselves in labor, and criticize and overcome bourgeois individualism. Through productive labor, we also closely connect with the masses and strengthen the mass viewpoint. For example, in the process of compiling teaching materials this time, we met more than 400 workers and technicians, played a role as assistants to them in production, and got along very well. Generally, we received their praise. During this period, the relationship between teachers and students has also been further strengthened. Not only do we live together, but also we can combine with each other in business activities and political activities. Under the leadership of the Party, teachers lead, arrange and are responsible for guiding the work of students, and students can also actively make suggestions to teachers, truly achieving teaching each other. A new teacher-student relationship is forming.

Facts have proved that the policy of combining education with productive labor put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is completely correct. Only by resolutely implementing this policy and carrying out educational revolution can our educational work serve the politics of the working class and serve socialist and communist construction. We must follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, learn from the existing preliminary experiences, actively correct shortcomings, better go deep into production and deep into reality, and strive to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

### 贯彻党的教育方针推进教学工作  汪槱生代表的发言

　　贯彻党的教育方针推进教学工作
    汪槱生代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。我是在浙江大学电机系工作的。自从党中央提出教育和生产劳动相结合的方针之后，在我们的学校中，积极贯彻了这一方针，并已取得很大成绩。现在，我把我们电机系，主要是电机专业在贯彻执行党的这个方针的实践中的几点体会，向大会作一汇报。
    毛主席指示：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育，几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。”这个方针明确地告诉我们，教育的目的是培养既能从事体力劳动又能从事脑力劳动，既有社会主义觉悟，又有文化的劳动者。根据这个方针来检查，在我们专业原有的教材内容上是存在不少问题的。几年来，我国电机制造工业及其生产技术水平不断发展，但在“电机制造工艺学”、“电机设计”等主要课程中，却没有足够的反映出来，许多问题的叙述一般化；在教学活动中，也很少贯串社会主义经济建设的方针政策；教师一般都缺乏系统的生产实际知识，讲课联系实际不够，特别是有关工艺结构问题，例如电机机座加工，必须保证各个圆面不偏心，这是工艺上很重要的问题，在工艺学中称为“同心度”，不深入现场是很难讲清楚的；在课程设计时选择一些结构尺寸或决定一些加工尺寸，几个教师往往会有几种不同的回答，甚至无法回答。
    对于这种情况，大多数师生都迫切要求改变，要求通过参加生产劳动，使书本的理论知识和丰富的生产知识结合起来。但是有少数人却满足于这种现状，他们强调高等学校是培养理论设计人才的，培养工艺制造人材是中等技术学校的任务；或者强调在学校学习，只需要具备一些基本的理论知识，至于生产知识，只能在毕业以后到工厂里再行“加工”。在这种思想的影响下，有的人就看不起生产，严重地脱离生产、脱离实际，整天在书本中打圈子。通过学习党的教育方针，进行反复辩论，初步统一了认识，看到祖国社会主义建设一日千里，各方面需要的人材极其迫切，我们高等工业学校培养出来的学生，如果在生产方面一窍不通，就失去教育的作用。但是有些人，对于参加生产劳动能否提高教学质量，还有一定的怀疑。事实是最好的证明，一年来我们大办工厂和下厂劳动，特别是最近二个多月来，组织部分教师和四年级学生七十人到上海电机厂和浙江肖山电机厂进行教学实习，一边参加生产劳动，一边进行现场教学，一边搜集资料编写讲义，在理论联系实际方面，取得比较显著的成绩。深入现场，实物摆在面前，讲课和实际操作同时进行，许多过去课堂上讲不清楚和不深不透的问题，现在就很易了解。我们在工厂实习时，大家处处寻师访友，人人求“经”取“宝”，因而获得了十分丰富的生产知识。同时，还有目的地分头阅读了好几百本国内外书刊资料，反复进行研究讨论，集体写成五十万字的“电机制造工艺学”讲义初稿。这个讲义与过去教材比较，内容丰富得多了。例如汽轮发电机、水轮发电机、直流电机、电动机等重要产品的制造工艺，都按不同的型式和工序，就它的工艺过程、制造方法、生产设备、产品检验等逐项进行阐述分析，比过去只讲一般原则的教材大大进了一步，过去课本上没有叙述的变压器制造工艺也增加进去了。特别是去年大跃进当中，这二个厂在工艺方面的许多技术革新成就，如土法连续式绝缘处理、小型设备加工汽轮发电机底板等等亦都编入讲义。同学们通过编写讲义，将获得的生产知识进行提炼分析、融会贯通，领会更加深刻，并提高了独立工作的能力。有的同学说：“以前毕业生怕下车间，怕搞工艺，现在我们不怕了。”一位老教授说：“几十年来，由于理论脱离实际，愈来愈感到山穷水尽疑无路，现在贯彻了党的教育方针，接触了生产，接触了实际，从实践中学到许多知识和学问，真是柳暗花明又一村。”由此可见，那种认为学生只有在课堂上、从书本中才能学到知识、教师只要“博览群书”就能讲好课的观点显然是不对的。通过编写讲义这一事实，还有力地证明了，工人不仅是物质财富的创造者，而且是科学文化的创造者；证明了生产实践是理论知识所取之不尽的源泉。因此，任何认为参加生产劳动会降低教学质量的看法是毫无根据的。为了更好地培养为社会主义建设服务的全面发展的人才，就必须认真地贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，切实做到理论联系实际，这是社会主义、共产主义教育的根本路线。
    贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，不但丰富了生产实际知识，提高了理论分析能力，而且还有力地推动了科学研究工作。以往高等学校中的科学研究工作开展得很不普遍，只是少数人冷冷清清闭门造车，研究的课题有许多是凭个人的兴趣选择或为个人的目的确定的。随着社会主义经济建设发展的需要，科学研究工作有了很大的开展，特别是去年贯彻了党的教育方针以后，科学研究工作大大地向前推进了一步。许多在生产中提出的结合专业教学的问题，都是我们进行科学研究的重要课题和内容。以我校电机系而言，去年三月至十二月完成的研究项目为以往八年的十三倍，其中有许多项目对改进生产方法、提高设备利用率、提高产品质量、节约原材料、创制新产品等方面都起了一定的作用。再则，科学研究工作本身就是一个实践和提高的过程，在科学研究工作进行中，常会碰到许多问题须要依靠丰富的生产实践知识才能解决，譬如去年我们电机系在某项科学研究工作中碰到抽真空、高温特种焊接、真空喷涂、合金电镀等多种技术问题；今年我们在进行另一项科学研究工作中还碰到环氧树脂使用技术问题。由于我们基本上学会和掌握了这些有关的生产技术知识，使这项科学研究工作才能进行。但是，我们的生产技术知识和物质条件同工厂比较起来，毕竟要差得多。所以在科学研究工作中学校必须与工厂企业相结合，并须取得工厂的协作。如果没有校内和校外工厂的协助，我们大部分的科学研究工作都将无法进行。我们深深地体会到，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，是高等学校开展科学研究的根本动力；而正确开展科学研究的结果，又直接有利于生产的发展，而且还丰富了教学内容，有助于系统地深入地掌握理论和实践知识，培养师生的独立工作能力，从而全面提高教学质量。认识开展科学研究和提高教学质量、推进生产建设之间的互相结合、互相促进的辩证关系是非常重要的。否则，抱着为了个人成名成家或满足个人兴趣而脱离实际、闭门造车地进行科学研究的资产阶级学者的观点和方法，是与我们目前进行科学研究工作的根本原则相违背的。
    通过生产劳动，还使师生的思想面貌有了显著的改变。无论在工厂参加生产劳动，在农村帮助抢收抢种，或参加各项义务劳动以及干部下放等等，我们都能做到和工人农民同吃同住同劳动，对体力劳动树立了比较正确的看法，劳动的观点加强了。工人农民的冲天革命干劲，对我们来说是一种很深刻的共产主义教育。他们为了完成生产任务，有时整天整夜不离开车间、田头，认真负责，全力以赴地辛勤劳动，生产指标一再冲破，使我们真正看到工农劳动者的高贵品质。许多人表示一定要放下架子，向工人农民学习，在劳动中改造自己，批判克服资产阶级个人主义思想。通过生产劳动，还密切联系群众，加强了群众观点。例如这次下厂编写教材过程中，结识四百多个工人和技术人员，在生产中对他们起了助手作用，相处得很好，一般都得到他们的好评。在这期间师生关系也进一步密切了。不仅在生活上打成一片，而且在业务活动及政治活动中亦能互相结合。在党的领导下，教师带领安排和负责指导同学的工作，同学也能积极对教师提出建议，真正做到教学相长。新的师生关系在形成中。
    事实证明，党中央和毛主席提出来的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针是十分正确的。只有坚决贯彻这个方针，开展教育革命，才能使我们的教育工作做到为工人阶级的政治服务，为社会主义和共产主义建设服务。我们一定要遵照毛主席所指示的道路，吸取已有的初步经验，积极改正缺点，更好地深入生产深入实际，为培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者而努力。
