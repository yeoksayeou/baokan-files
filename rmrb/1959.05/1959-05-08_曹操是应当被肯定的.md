Cao Cao Should Be Affirmed
You Shaoyin

Yang Bing's article "Should Cao Cao Be Affirmed?" published in the People's Daily on April 21st, first raises the following question for us: What standards should we use to evaluate historical figures? In Yang Bing's words, what exactly is the standard of "people's interests"? If this problem is not solved, it will be impossible to draw scientific conclusions.

Historical materialism teaches us that there is only one standard for evaluating historical figures, and that is whether they promote or hinder the progress of society. Unfortunately, Yang Bing's article shows that he is not using this only correct standard to measure Cao Cao's actions.

Based on this standard to evaluate Cao Cao, I basically agree with Comrade Guo Moruo's opinion: Cao Cao should be rehabilitated.

**Cannot Evaluate Based Solely on Cao Cao's War Behavior; Should Examine Cao Cao's Political Activities**

So, what role did Cao Cao play in history? This requires us to start from the historical conditions at the time and conduct a comprehensive and specific examination of his life.

However, based on what actions of Cao Cao should we evaluate him? Here, we also disagree with Comrade Yang Bing. He argues that we should mainly evaluate based on Cao Cao's war behavior, while we believe that we should examine Cao Cao's entire political career. War is the continuation of politics. It is a violent means of implementing politics, but it is by no means an end in itself. Nor is it all of politics. Therefore, war is only one aspect of evaluating Cao Cao, and to understand the nature of Cao Cao's wars, we must seek it from his political goals. In this light, Yang Bing's disagreement with Cao Cao's "suppressing the powerful and reducing taxes," "military agricultural colonies," and "commoner demeanor" as a basis or main basis should all be treated as an aspect of evaluating him, just like his war deeds.

Cao Cao's life, from his appointment as the Northern Commandant of Luoyang in 174 to his death in Luoyang in 221, can be divided into two stages, with the defeat of the Qingzhou Yellow Turbans in December 192 as the dividing line. In the first stage, the main problems in society were the struggle between the aristocratic families and the eunuchs within the ruling class, and the uprisings of the broad masses of peasants such as the Yellow Turbans. In the later stage, the entire social situation underwent new changes. At this time, the struggle between the aristocratic families and the eunuchs had already ended after Dong Zhuo entered Luoyang, and the peasant uprisings also ultimately failed. At this time, the main problem in society had shifted to the aspect of secession and unification, which contained various contradictions within the landlord class.

**Cao Cao's Suppression of the Yellow Turban Uprising Was Reactionary and Should Be Condemned by the People, But This Cannot Be Used to Completely Negate the Positive Role Cao Cao Played**

Participating in the suppression of the Yellow Turban Uprising is the main point we should grasp when evaluating Cao Cao's activities in the first stage. Obviously, Cao Cao's suppression of the Yellow Turban Uprising was reactionary, and the war he waged was unjust. When evaluating Cao Cao's role in history, we should appropriately estimate its significance. Because from this event, we can see Cao Cao's class nature and the limitations of his progressive activities in the unification of the north. Comrade Guo Moruo believes that "Although Cao Cao fought the Yellow Turbans, he did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising," and that Cao Cao "inherited the Yellow Turban movement." This statement is one-sided. As he himself said, the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising was "to have food, land, and to survive," and Cao Cao's "organization" and military agricultural colony measures for the Qingzhou Yellow Turbans did, in fact, objectively meet the demands of the peasants to a limited extent. However, first of all, the peasant uprising was aimed at opposing feudal exploitation, although this goal could not be truly realized at that time, but we must not reduce the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising to simply "avoiding the disaster of disintegration and displacement" and not starving to death. The fundamental difference here is: the Yellow Turbans opposed feudal exploitation, while Cao Cao was doing his best to maintain it. Although at that time, the former could only be an ideal, and the latter was also understandable, their class essences were directly opposed. Therefore, it cannot be said that one did not violate the purpose of the other, let alone that one inherited the other. My opinion is: Cao Cao's suppression of the Yellow Turban Uprising was reactionary and should be condemned by the people. We must not defend his reactionary behavior or reduce his historical responsibility simply because he implemented policies that were beneficial or concessional to the Yellow Turban peasants after fighting the Yellow Turbans. That would be wrong. Although Guo Lao also pointed out that "This is the most disgraceful page in Cao Cao's life," he did not use the word "reactionary." Guo Lao's estimation of this matter is probably a bit too light! However, we must not completely negate the positive role he played in this era simply because Cao Cao once suppressed the Yellow Turbans.

Cao Cao's activities in this stage, such as forming ties with the aristocratic families, opposing the eunuchs, and fighting against Dong Zhuo, were all progressive to a certain extent at the time. These were all inherited and carried forward in his later stage of unifying the north and the various policies implemented in the process of unifying the north.

The later stage was the entire process of Cao Cao using the "Qingzhou Soldiers" as the basic armed force, "holding the emperor to command the lords," suppressing the powerful, curbing annexation, opening up military agricultural colonies, reducing taxes, cultivating internal governance, advocating military achievements externally, and finally unifying the north. The progressive significance of the various policies implemented by Cao Cao in this stage has been discussed by Guo Lao and many other comrades. Here, we will only study the reasons for negation held by Comrade Yang Bing.

**Cao Cao's Wars to Unify the North Were Just, But in the Wars, He Killed Many People and Disrupted the Peaceful Life of the Residents. These Were All Cao Cao's Mistakes.**

Cao Cao waged many wars to unify the north. If viewed formally, this is indeed "a struggle for hegemony within the feudal class," and it is indeed like this: "Cao Cao devoted most of his energy to such wars throughout his life. When comprehensively evaluating Cao Cao, this point must not be underestimated in the slightest." Probably because of this, Comrade Yang Bing, regardless of whether others agree or not, pulls Cao Cao's words "fearing that he would leave the army and be harmed by others" as a basis for his argument. In fact, Cao Cao's words cannot help him explain anything. What is needed here is a realistic analysis of the causes, purposes, and effects of the war. The Yellow Turban Uprising had attacked the entire landlord class, but in the case where the ruling power of the upper-level aristocratic landlords was weakened, it relatively strengthened the position of the lower-level non-aristocratic landlords, creating opportunities for them to rise in various places. After the chaos of Dong Zhuo, the eunuch group disintegrated, and the Eastern Han Empire fell into a state of division. Within the landlord class, there were two forces that could influence the political situation at that time: the aristocratic landlords and the non-aristocratic landlords. The non-aristocratic landlords and the lower-level aristocratic landlords were dissatisfied with the "annexation" and "arbitrariness" of the upper-level aristocratic families (such as the Yuan family, the Yang family, and Liu Biao, etc.), and they were not strong enough to become a separatist force in one place. Therefore, they demanded a unified situation in the north. Thus, Cao Cao, known for his "wisdom," was chosen by them as a tool to achieve unification. It can also be seen here that the road for Cao Cao to rise from a "despised descendant of eunuchs" to a "hero of the world" was paved for him by the Yellow Turban Uprising. At the same time, the people hated the annexation policies of the powerful families and opposed the endless wars caused by the feudal separatism of various parties, demanding recuperation and reproduction, and therefore hoped to achieve unification. In the process of waging the unification war, Cao Cao implemented a military agricultural colony policy to ensure the supply of military grain, enabling the displaced farmers who had lost their land and left the land to return to agriculture, so that "grain was accumulated everywhere, and the granaries were full" ("Records of the Three Kingdoms, Biography of Ren Jun of the Wei Dynasty"), "within five years, the granaries were abundant" ("Records of the Three Kingdoms, Biography of Guo Yuan of the Wei Dynasty"). This not only solved the problem of military grain but also, within Cao Cao's ruling area, made this "the free people who were bound to perish in the ancient world" detached from labor, and the millions of displaced people wandering in society - the most serious problem at that time that the Han Empire had been unable to solve - basically solved, thus gradually restoring the rural economy of northern China. This played a progressive role at the time.

In addition, Cao Cao's expeditions to the three counties of Wuhuan and his attacks on the combined forces of the Daigun Wuhuan and Xianbei Ke Bineng were all just wars against aggression. The victory of this war ensured the peaceful life of the people along the Chinese border, and agricultural production could proceed smoothly, which was in line with the demands of the people.

Of course, Cao Cao was by no means a perfect person, and he also made mistakes in waging wars. For example, at the beginning of the attack on Zhang Lu, he went deep into the Wudu area where ethnic people lived, disrupting their peaceful lives, which was wrong; in a certain war, he killed some people, which was also wrong. We should not cover up these either. However, these are only secondary aspects after all, and they must not be used to obliterate the main aspects.

**Cao Cao's Policies Such as Suppressing the Powerful, Curbing Annexation, Reducing Rents and Taxes, and Promoting Military Agricultural Colonies Changed the Relations of Production and Were Beneficial to the Development of Production to a Certain Extent.**

Comrade Yang Bing accused: "Comrades are constantly saying that Cao Cao's suppression of the powerful and so on are beneficial to the development of production. Then, what conditions are needed first to develop production? Isn't it the social productive forces that are needed first? And what is the main factor of the productive forces? Isn't it the labor force of the people? In that era when production tools were very backward, wasn't the labor force of the people even more important? What 'progressive' significance is there in feudal rulers like Cao Cao eliminating the labor force of the people in such large numbers?..." There are three issues here that need to be studied: First, "what conditions were needed first to develop production" at that time? Second, was Cao Cao's "policy of suppressing the powerful, etc." necessary for the development of production at that time? Third, how much responsibility should Cao Cao himself bear for "feudal rulers eliminating the labor force of the people in such large numbers"?

The most fundamental reason for the peasant uprising at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty was the conflict between the productive forces and the relations of production. The main crisis of the Eastern Han Empire was the concentration of land by large landowners, the poverty and bankruptcy of peasants, and even a large number of exiles. At that time, "the houses of the powerful people were connected with hundreds of beams, the fertile fields were full of wilderness, there were thousands of slaves and maids, and tens of thousands of followers. Ships and carts sold goods, traveled in all directions, abandoned residences and accumulated storage, filling the capitals. Strange gifts and treasures could not be contained in the large houses, and horses, cattle, sheep, pigs could not be received in the mountains and valleys.妖童美妾(handsome boys and beautiful concubines) filled the beautiful rooms, and singers and musicians were listed in the deep halls." ("Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Biography of Zhongchang Tong") And what about the peasants? "Spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvesting, winter storage, cutting firewood, governing the government, providing corvée labor, spring cannot avoid the dust and wind, summer cannot avoid the heat, autumn cannot avoid the rain, winter cannot avoid the cold, there is no day of rest between the four seasons... suffering so hard" ("Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Goods"); but under the cruel oppression of "since Qin... the labor force is thirty times greater than in ancient times, the land rent, head tax, and salt and iron profits are twenty times greater than in ancient times... the Han Dynasty followed without changing" and under the burden of war donations and high interest loans of "men's labor is not enough for food and women's spinning is not enough for clothing" ("Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Goods"), they still went bankrupt rapidly and could not live, some even actively abandoned their land in order to escape the heavy burden of war and huge rents and taxes, the so-called "the people are worried and have nothing to rely on, fleeing to the mountains and forests." The people were really in deep water and fire! The increasing sharpening and intensification of this contradiction between the vast number of peasants and the feudal landlord class led to the decline of the military power of the Eastern Han Empire, and the empire's rule over the vassal states was shaken. This situation, reflected within the ruling class group, was the fierce struggle between officials and eunuchs in the central government, and the conditions for the local governors and prefects and other upper-level aristocratic landlords to seize power and separatism were gradually formed. Years of civil war caused great disasters to the people.

Okay, now let's take a look, under the specific historical conditions at that time, "what conditions were needed first to develop production"? Is it first necessary to improve the social productive forces? Or is it first necessary to change the old relations of production? The issue of productive forces naturally needs to be resolved at any time, but at that time, the main issue that needed to be resolved first was how to make it possible and realistic to use this social productive force that had already grown up, that is, how to enable peasants to carry out normal production, and a large number of displaced people could return to agriculture. Therefore, this requires changing the old relations of production, and only by changing the old relations of production can the social productive forces obtain a place to operate. Let me repeat, the peasant uprising was because the development of productive forces was seriously hindered by the relations of production.

In this light, Cao Cao's policies and measures at that time, such as suppressing the powerful, curbing annexation, reducing rents and taxes (by the way, some people at that time called it "one out of a hundred taxes"), promoting military agricultural colonies, and recruiting returning migrants, giving them ownerless wasteland, and lending them plows and cattle, all changed the relations of production to a certain extent and to a certain extent (please note that this is not saying that the old relations of production were destroyed, because that requirement violates historical viewpoints). Therefore, it should be admitted that it is conducive to the development of production and is necessary for the development of production at that time. The situation of social production development in northern China in those years is clear evidence.

**Cao Cao Won Power by Walking on the Road Paved by the Yellow Turban Peasants, But He Also Did Many Good Things That Were Beneficial to the People's Lives and Promoted the Historical Development Forward.**

Of course, at that time, "feudal rulers eliminated the labor force of the people in such large numbers..." was a bloody reactionary act. Cao Cao's participation in the suppression of the Yellow Turbans was also reactionary. However, at that time, the role played by Cao Cao, whether viewed from the actual role he played or compared with his position on the political stage in the later stage, was only a secondary role of playing "Three-Patches Face." At the same time, as Comrade Guo Moruo pointed out, we should also further look at "what were the consequences after Cao Cao fought the Yellow Turbans."

Comrade Yang Bing criticized this point and said: "Who should strictly organize the revolutionary army? This is where our disagreement lies. I think that the peasant leaders should strictly organize it. The comrades who praise Cao Cao think that Cao Cao, who suppressed the Yellow Turbans, should take on this task." However, I think that the issue here is not whether it should or should not be done, nor is it a question of people's wishes, but whether it violates historical reality. If we agree with Comrade Yang Bing's view, then the ancient Chinese social history can only be a mess, because that feudal system should be overthrown.

Comrade Yang Bing also accused that "inducing surrender and reorganizing the Yellow Turban army" was Cao Cao's "greatest treachery and cunning"; because "killing the Yellow Turban army, the revolutionary forces are weakened, and the counter-revolutionary forces are not strengthened; inducing surrender and reorganizing the Yellow Turban army, the revolutionary forces are weakened, and the counter-revolutionary forces are strengthened." Strange! Could it be that at that time, when the peasant uprising could not achieve victory, it would be better to slaughter all the defeated Yellow Turban peasants? This is really a view that violates the historical materialist viewpoint!

When making a comprehensive evaluation of Cao Cao, we must see that the later stage was the main period of his life activities, while the former stage was relatively secondary. Taking Cao Cao's suppression of the Yellow Turbans and the unification of the north as examples, whether from the role Cao Cao played in it or from the length of time they took, the latter cannot be compared with the former. The unified situation in the north created by Cao Cao's active activities and painstaking management not only conformed to the wishes of the people but also reflected the requirements of production development; and the various active policies he implemented in the process of unification to suppress the powerful and restore production not only contained the significance of concessions to the peasants but also greatly promoted the development of agricultural production and promoted the cause of unification. These had a direct and significant positive effect on the later unification of the country by the Western Jin Dynasty.

In general, Cao Cao won his position and power by walking on the road paved by the Yellow Turban peasants. And he also made full use of his position and power to do many good things that were beneficial to social production and the people's lives, and promoted the historical development at that time. Therefore, Cao Cao should be affirmed.

### 曹操是应当被肯定的

专栏：

　　曹操是应当被肯定的
　　游绍尹
    人民日报4月21日发表的杨柄同志“曹操应当被肯定吗？”一文，首先给我们提出了这样一个问题：究竟应该依据什么标准来评价历史人物？用杨柄同志的话说，就是究竟什么叫“人民利益”的标准？如果不解决这个问题，那就不可能得出科学的结论。
    历史唯物主义教导我们，评价历史人物的标准只有一个，那就是看他是推动社会向前进步呢，还是阻碍它。可惜杨柄同志的文章，表明他并不是依据这个唯一正确的标准来衡量曹操的所作所为的。
    依据这个标准来评价曹操，我是基本上同意郭沫若同志的意见的：应该替曹操翻案。
    不能只根据曹操的战争行为进行评价，应该根据曹操的政治活动进行考察
    那末，曹操在历史上究竟起了什么作用呢？这就必须从当时的历史条件出发，对他的生平事迹进行全面的具体的考察了。
    然而，应该根据曹操的什么行为来评价他呢？在这里，我们又和杨柄同志存在着分歧。他主张只能主要地根据曹操的战争行为来评价，我们则认为应该根据曹操的全部政治来考察。战争是政治的继续。是贯彻政治的暴力手段，其本身决不是目的。它也不是全部政治。因此，战争只是评价曹操的一个方面，而且要了解曹操所进行的战争的性质，必须从他的政治目的中去寻求。这样看来，杨柄同志不同意作为根据或主要根据的曹操“抑制豪强和减税”、“屯田”和“平民风度”等，也都应该与他的战争事迹一样，作为评价他的一个方面了。
    曹操一生的事迹，从174年他出任洛阳北部尉起，至221年病死洛阳止，如果以192年12月击溃青州黄巾军为分界点，可以划分为前后两个阶段。前一阶段里社会最主要问题，是统治阶级内部进行的士族与宦官的斗争及黄巾军等广大农民起义。到了后一阶段，整个社会的形势就发生了新的变化，这时士族与宦官的斗争早在董卓入洛阳后结束了，而农民起义也终归失败。这时，社会最主要问题已转移到割据与统一方面，在这里面包含有地主阶级内部的各种矛盾。
    曹操镇压黄巾起义是反动的，应受人民的谴责，但不能因此就全盘否定曹操所起的积极作用
    参与镇压黄巾起义，是我们评价曹操前一阶段的活动所应该掌握的主要之点。显然，曹操镇压黄巾起义是反动的，他所进行的这种战争是非正义性的。我们在评价曹操在历史上的作用时，应该恰如其分地估计它的意义。因为从这件事，我们可以看出曹操的阶级本质及他以后在统一北方过程中具有进步意义的活动的局限性。郭沫若同志认为“曹操虽然打了黄巾，但没有违背黄巾起义的目的”，曹操“承继了黄巾运动”。这种说法是有片面性的。正如他自己说的，黄巾起义的目的是“要粮食，要土地，要活下去”，而曹操对青州黄巾军进行的“组织化”和屯田措施，确实在客观上在有限范围内满足了农民这种要求。但是，首先农民起义为的是反对封建剥削，虽然这个目的在当时决不可能真正实现，但是我们也决不能把黄巾起义的目的，降低到只要“免掉了‘瓦解流离’”之患和不致饿死。这里的根本分歧是：黄巾军反对封建剥削，而曹操却在极力维护着它。虽然在当时，前者只能是理想，后者也是可以理解的，但是他们的阶级本质却是直接对立的。因此，也就不能说一个没有违背另一个的目的，更不能说一个承继另一个了。我的意见是：曹操镇压黄巾起义是反动的，应该受到人民的谴责，决不能因为他打黄巾后实施了对黄巾农民有利的或让步的政策，就来为他这种反动行为作辩解，或减轻他对历史应负的责任。那样都是不对的。郭老虽然也指出“这是曹操一生中最不光彩的一页”，但是他就没有用过“反动”二字。郭老对这件事的估计，恐怕有点失之过轻了吧！但是，我们决不能因为曹操曾经镇压黄巾，就全盘否定他在这一时代所起的积极作用。
    曹操在这一阶段所进行的结纳士族、反对宦官以及反对董卓的斗争等活动，在当时都是具有一定进步性的。这些，都为他后一阶段统一北方和统一北方过程中所实施的各项政策加以承继和发扬了。
    后一阶段是曹操利用“青州兵”这支基本武装，“挟天子以令诸候”，锄豪强，抑兼并，开屯田，轻赋税，内修文治，外尚武功，终于统一北方的整个过程。曹操在这一阶段实施的各项政策的进步意义，郭老和其他许多同志都谈过了，这里只就杨柄同志所持的否定理由加以研究。
    曹操为了统一北方进行的战争是正义的，但在战争中，多杀了人，破坏了居民的和平生活，这都是曹操的错误
    曹操为了统一北方，进行了许多战争。如果从形式上看，这确是“封建阶级内部争夺霸权的斗争”，也确实是这样：“曹操毕生精力大部分用于这类战争。在全面评价曹操时这一点绝不容许有丝毫的低估。”大概正因为这样，杨柄同志才不管别人同意与否，拉着曹操“恐己离兵，为人所祸也”这句话为自己的论点作根据。其实，曹操这句话是不能帮助他说明什么的。这里需要的，是对战争的原因、目的和作用作实事求是的分析。黄巾起义曾打击了整个地主阶级，但是在上层士族地主的统治势力受到削弱较大的情况下，它却相对地加强了下层非士族地主的地位，造成了他们在各地抬头的机会。从董卓乱后，宦官集团土崩瓦解，东汉帝国陷入分裂局面，地主阶级内部便存在着士族地主和非士族地主这样两种能够影响当时政局的力量。非士族地主和下层士族地主既不满于上层士族大家（如袁家、杨家和刘表等）的“兼并”和“擅恣”，又不足以成为一方割据的力量，因此他们要求北方出现统一局面。于是，以“明哲”见称的曹操就被他们选作了实现统一的工具。这里也可看出：曹操由一个“赘阉遗丑”上升为“天下英雄”的道路，是黄巾起义为他铺平的。同时，人民痛恨强家豪右的兼并政策，反对各方封建割据所引起的无休止的战争，要求休养生息，因此希望实现统一。而曹操在进行统一战争的过程中，为了保证军粮的供应所实行的屯田政策，使失去了土地和脱离了土地的流荡农民，重新复归于农业，以致“所在积粟，仓廪皆满”（三国志魏志任峻传），“五年中，仓廪丰实”（三国志魏志国渊传），这不仅解决了军粮问题，而且在曹操的统治区内，使这种“使古代世界非灭亡不可的”自由民脱离劳动、流民上千万在社会上流荡的现象——这个汉帝国一直未能解决的当时最严重的问题，获得了基本解决，从而逐步地恢复了北中国的农村经济。这在当时是起了进步作用的。
    另外，曹操远征三郡乌桓和进击代郡乌桓与鲜卑轲比能联军，都是反侵略的正义战争。这种战争的胜利，使中国沿边境的人民的和平生活有了保障，农业生产能够顺利进行，是符合人民的要求的。
    当然，曹操决不是一个完人，他在进行战争时也有过过错。例如，进攻张鲁之初，深入氏族人民居住的武都地区，破坏他们的和平生活，这是不对的；在某次战争中，多杀了一些人，这也是不应该的。对于这些，我们也不应该替他遮盖。但是，这毕竟只是次要的方面，决不能因此抹煞其主要方面。
    曹操所实行的锄豪强、抑兼并、轻租税、兴屯田等政策改变了生产关系，在一定的程度上是有利于发展生产的
    杨柄同志指责说：“同志们口口声声说曹操的压抑豪强等等对于发展生产有利，那么，要使生产发展，首先需要什么条件呢？岂不是首先需要社会生产力吗？而生产力的主要因素是什么呢？难道不正是人民的劳动力吗？在生产工具十分落后的当时，人民的劳动力不是更为重要吗？曹操等封建统治者这样大量地消灭人民的劳动力，有什么‘进步’意义可言呢？……”这里有三个问题需要加以研究：第一、究竟当时“要使生产发展，首先需要什么条件呢？”第二、曹操实施的“压制豪强等等政策”是否为当时发展生产所必需？第三、“封建统治者这样大量地消灭人民的劳动力”，曹操本人究竟应负多大责任？
    东汉末年农民起义的最根本的原因，是生产力与生产关系之间的冲突。东汉帝国的主要危机，是大土地所有者土地的集中，农民的贫困、破产，以至于大批流亡。当时，“豪人之室，连栋数百，膏田满野，奴婢千群，徒附万计。船车贾贩，周于四方，废居积贮，满于都城。琦赂宝货，巨室不能容，马牛羊豕，山谷不能受。妖童美妾，填乎绮室，倡讴伎乐，列乎深堂。”（后汉书仲长统传）而农民呢？“春耕、夏耘、秋获、冬藏，伐薪樵，治官府，给徭役，春不得避风尘，夏不得避暑热，秋不得避阴雨，冬不得避寒冻，四时之间，亡日休息。……勤苦如此”（汉书食货志）；但是在“自秦……力役三十倍于古，田租、口赋、盐铁之利，二十倍于古，……汉兴，循而未改”的残酷压榨下，在“男子力耕不足粮饷，女子纺绩不足衣服”（汉书食货志）的战争捐税和高利贷的负担下，他们还是急剧破产，无法生活下去，有的甚至为了逃避战争重负和巨额租税，主动地放弃了土地，所谓“民愁亡聊，亡逃山林”。人民真是处于水深火热之中！广大农民与封建地主阶级的这种矛盾的日益尖锐和激化，造成了东汉帝国军事威力的衰落，帝国对属国的统治动摇了。而这种情况，反映在统治阶级集团内部，在中央则是士夫与外戚、宦官的斗争激烈展开，在地方则是刺史、太守等上层士族地主擅兵割据的条件也逐渐形成。连年混战给人民造成了莫大的灾难。
    好了，现在就让我们看一看，在当时的具体历史条件下，“要使生产发展，首先需要什么条件呢”？是首先需要提高社会生产力呢？还是首先需要改变旧的生产关系？生产力的问题，自然是在任何时候都需要解决的，但是，在当时首先需要解决的主要问题，却是如何使利用这种已经成长起来的社会生产力成为可能、变为现实，即如何使农民能够进行正常生产，大批流民可以重归农业。因此，这就需要改变旧的生产关系，也只有改变旧的生产关系，才能使社会生产力获得活动的场所。让我再重复一遍，农民起义，就是因为生产力的发展受到了生产关系的严重阻碍。
    这样看来，曹操当时实行的锄豪强、抑兼并、轻租赋（顺便说一句，当时有人称之为“百一之税”呢）、兴屯田，以及招回流亡人口，给以无主荒地，并贷以犁牛等等政策和措施，都在一定范围内和一定程度上改变了生产关系（请注意，这里不是说摧毁了旧的生产关系，因为那样要求是违反历史观点的）。因此，应该承认它是有利于发展生产的，是为当时生产发展所必需的。当年北中国社会生产发展的情况，就是明证。
    曹操踏着黄巾农民铺平的道路，赢得了权势，但他也做了许多有利于人民生活的好事，推动了历史向前发展
    当然，当时“封建统治者这样大量地消灭人民的劳动力……”，是血腥的反动行为。曹操参与镇压黄巾，也是反动的。但是，当时曹操扮演的角色，无论是从他所起的实际作用看，还是从与他后一阶段在政治舞台上的地位比较看，还只算得演“三花脸”的次要角色　同时，正如郭沫若同志指出的，还应该进一步看看“曹操打了黄巾后的后果如何”。
    杨柄同志批评这点说：“应当由谁来把革命军严密地组织起来呢？这就是我们的分歧所在。我认为，应当由农民领袖严密地组织起来，歌颂曹操的同志们则认为要由镇压黄巾的曹操来担负这个任务”。但是，我却认为，这里的问题，不是应当不应当的问题，也不是人们的愿望问题，而是违反不违反历史现实的问题。如果同意杨柄同志的这种观点，那末中国古代社会历史，就只能是一笔糊涂账了，因为那种封建制度是应当被推翻的。
    杨柄同志还指责说：“诱降和改编黄巾军”，是曹操“最大的阴险和权诈”；因为“屠杀黄巾军，革命力量有消，反革命力量无长；诱降和改编黄巾军，革命力量有消，反革命力量有长。”怪哉！难道在当时，在农民起义无法取得胜利的当时，要对失败的黄巾农民加以全部屠杀才好吗？这真是一种违反历史唯物主义观点的说法！
    在对曹操作全面评价时，必须看到后一阶段是他一生中的主要活动时期，而前一阶段则相对地是次要的　就以曹操镇压黄巾和统一北方的工作这两件事来说，无论是从曹操在其中所起的作用，还是从它们为时的长短来看，后者都不是前者所可比拟的。在曹操积极活动、苦心经营下所造成的北方统一局面，不仅符合人民的愿望，而且反映了生产发展的要求；而他在统一过程中所实施的压抑豪强和恢复生产的各项积极政策，不仅包含有对农民让步的意义，而且大大地促进了农业生产的发展，促进了统一事业。这些，对后来西晋的统一全国都具有直接的重大的积极作用。
    总的说来，曹操踏着黄巾农民所铺平的道路，赢得了地位和权势。而他也充分地利用了自己的这种地位和权势，做了许多有利于社会生产和人民生活的好事，推动了当时历史向前发展。因此，曹操是应当被肯定的。
