    A Brief History of the Successive Dalai Lamas

    The title "Dalai Lama" was officially conferred by the Qing Dynasty government in the tenth year of the Shunzhi reign (1653). In 1652, the Fifth Dalai Lama, Lobsang Gyatso, traveled from Tibet to Beijing to pay homage to the Qing Emperor. The following year, the Dalai returned to Tibet, and the Qing Emperor formally conferred upon him the title "The All-Good Self-Existing Buddha of the Western Heavens, Overseer of the Buddhist Faith Under Heaven, Universal Vajra-dhara Dalai Lama." From then on, the title of Dalai Lama was passed down.

    However, from the Fifth Dalai Lama onwards, under the duress and threat of the most reactionary great serf owners in Tibet, they lived a "puppet" life. Even more cruelly, the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Dalai Lamas were successively murdered by the Tibetan great serf owners in their youth. In the later period, the Tibetan great serf owners became agents of British imperialism in Tibet.

    British imperialism's invasion of Tibet occurred more than fifty years before, during the 30th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1904). In that year, British imperialism launched a large-scale armed invasion of Tibet and captured Lhasa. Because the Tibetan people resolutely resisted, British imperialism adopted a more insidious and vicious method, claiming to "help" the Tibetan people achieve "independence," actually attempting to turn the Tibetan people from opposing imperialism to opposing the motherland, and cultivated a group of agents among the Tibetan great serf owners. From the following brief history, we can clearly see the origin of the Dalai Lama's title, position, powers, and the organization of the Tibetan local government, as well as the relationship between Tibet and the motherland, and between the Tibetan local government and the central government. At the same time, we can also clearly see the coercion and killing of the Dalai Lama by the Tibetan great serf owners and the aggression of Tibet by British imperialism.

    First Dalai Lama: Gendun Drup
    Born in 1391 (24th year of the Ming Dynasty's Hongwu reign), died in 1474 (10th year of the Ming Dynasty's Chenghua reign), at the age of eighty-four.

    Gendun Drup came from a poor herding family in Xiaidui, in the Tsang region (present-day Shigatse). He became a monk at the age of fifteen, studying the Red Hat sect under Tsongtruk Khedrup. At the age of twenty-five, he traveled to the Ü-Tsang region (central Tibet), listened to the teachings of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Hat sect, and was deeply impressed, becoming a disciple of Tsongkhapa.

    In 1447 (12th year of the Ming Dynasty's Zhengtong reign), Gendun Drup, with the assistance of the chieftain of Samdrubtse (i.e., Shigatse), built the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Samdrubtse. Upon its completion, he became the "law throne" (law throne, Tibetan name Chiba, like the later abbot of a temple) of the monastery. At that time, Khedrup Je (the First Panchen Lama), the law throne of Ganden Monastery, passed away in 1438, and the monastic affairs were without a leader. The monks sent people to invite Gendun Drup to go. Gendun Drup declined, saying that Tashilhunpo Monastery was newly built and he was unwilling to leave, and instead recommended Khedrup Je's younger brother to succeed as law throne. Gendun Drup passed away in 1474 at the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Tsang.

    At this time, Tibet was ruled by the Karma Kagyu sect (White Hat sect) dharma king. Karma Kagyu Phagmodrupa Lodro Gyaltsen was enfeoffed as the "Chanhua King" in the 7th year of the Ming Dynasty's Yongle reign (1409). Thereafter, his family inherited the title for generations.

    Second Dalai Lama: Gendun Gyatso
    Born in 1475 (11th year of the Ming Dynasty's Chenghua reign), died in 1542 (21st year of the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing reign), at the age of sixty-seven.

    Gendun Gyatso came from a peasant family in Tana, in the Tsang region. At the age of eleven, he was welcomed to Tashilhunpo Monastery by the monks of the monastery. At the age of twenty, due to disagreements with the law throne of the monastery, he accepted the invitation of the law throne of Drepung Monastery and went to Drepung Monastery in Lhasa to study sutras. While at Drepung Monastery, he traveled to the Ü-Tsang region to preach and lecture. Later, the law throne of Tashilhunpo Monastery again led the monks to welcome him back. Gendun Gyatso returned, but within a few months returned to Lhasa. In Lhasa, he served as the tenth law throne of Drepung Monastery and concurrently as the ninth law throne of Sera Monastery. He passed away at Drepung Monastery in 1542.

    Third Dalai Lama: Sonam Gyatso
    Born in 1543 (22nd year of the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing reign), died in 1588 (16th year of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign), at the age of forty-six.

    Sonam Gyatso came from a peasant family in Drolung, in the Ü region. At the age of four, he was recognized as a reincarnate lama and welcomed to Drepung Monastery for offerings. At the age of seven, he became a disciple of Sonam Drakpa, then the law throne of Drepung Monastery. At the age of eleven, Sonam Drakpa retired, and the monks of Drepung Monastery publicly elected Sonam Gyatso as the twelfth law throne of Drepung Monastery. Thereafter, he went to Tashilhunpo Monastery to lecture on sutras, traveled to Shannan, and returned to Lhasa, concurrently serving as the thirteenth law throne of Sera Monastery.

    In 1577, he traveled to Qinghai, Xikang, and other places to preach and lecture, enduring hardships before reaching the vicinity of Xining, the hometown of Tsongkhapa. At that time, the Mongol Khan Altan (enfeoffed as Prince Shunyi by the Ming Dynasty) invaded Qinghai. Hearing of Sonam Gyatso's arrival, he led ten thousand people to welcome him, bestowing upon him the honorific title "Omniscient Vajradhara Dalai Lama." The name Dalai Lama began from this time.

    When Altan led his army back east to Tümed (the Gui Sui area today), he invited Sonam Gyatso to preach in Inner Mongolia. Passing through Gansu, he accepted Altan's suggestion and wrote a letter to Zhang Juzheng, the Prime Minister of the Ming Dynasty:
  "Shakyamuni Bhikshu Sonam Gyatso, auspicious, palms together in reverence to the court, respectfully addressing Your Excellency Zhang, in charge of great national affairs. Your fame shines like the sun and moon, known throughout the world. I pray for the Emperor, chanting sutras day and night, wishing peace to the world. Gifts enclosed: a statue of the Four-Armed Avalokiteshvara, two bolts of p’u-lu woolen cloth, a Vajra knot. Your Excellency should instruct Prince Shunyi (i.e., Altan) to return to Mongolia as soon as possible, and I will advise him to comply."

    This was the beginning of the Dalai Lama's dealings with officials of the Beijing central government. Later, Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty (Wanli 16th year) also sent people to welcome Sonam Gyatso to Beijing, but unfortunately, he passed away that year (1588) in Inner Mongolia, so the trip to Beijing did not materialize.

    Fourth Dalai Lama: Yonten Gyatso
    Born in 1589 (17th year of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign), died in 1616 (44th year of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign), at the age of twenty-eight.

    Yonten Gyatso came from the family of a Taiji (a noble title) of the Tumed Mongol tribe in Inner Mongolia. At the age of fourteen, he was welcomed to Tibet, and at the age of fifteen, he arrived at Reting Monastery in northern Tibet, then resided at Drepung Monastery to study sutras, becoming a disciple of Gendun Gyatso, then the law throne of Ganden Monastery. In 1607, he also went to Tashilhunpo Monastery to seek the Dharma from the Fourth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, who was then the law throne of the monastery. In 1614 (42nd year of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign), Yonten Gyatso invited the Fourth Panchen Lama to Drepung Monastery and became a disciple of the Fourth Panchen Lama. Later, at the request of the monks of Drepung Monastery, Yonten Gyatso served as the thirteenth law throne of Drepung Monastery and concurrently as the fifteenth law throne of Sera Monastery. He passed away at Drepung Monastery in 1616.

    Fifth Dalai Lama: Lobsang Gyatso
    Born in 1617 (45th year of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign), died in 1682 (21st year of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi reign), at the age of sixty-six.

    Lobsang Gyatso came from a diligent farming family in Chonggye, in the Lhoka region. At the age of six, he was welcomed to Drepung Monastery by monks from the three great monasteries, and at the age of nine, he became a disciple of the Fourth Panchen Lama. In the 15th year of the Ming Dynasty's Chongzhen reign, the Fifth Dalai Lama and the Fourth Panchen Lama, with the help of Gushri Khan, the chieftain of the Mongol tribe in Qinghai, seized political power in Tibet, becoming the religious and political leader of Tibet.

    This was at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Later, the Qing Dynasty entered the pass, and Emperor Shunzhi sent envoys to Tibet to inquire after the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, and gave offerings to the major monasteries. The Dalai and Panchen Lamas also sent envoys to Beijing to offer congratulations and local products. In 1651, Emperor Shunzhi sent two lamas to Tibet to invite the Fifth Dalai Lama to Beijing. In 1652 (9th year of the Qing Dynasty's Shunzhi reign), the Fifth Dalai Lama led Tibetan officials and attendants to Beijing. Emperor Shunzhi allowed the Dalai to enter the capital in a yellow palanquin, residing at the Yellow Temple, and held a banquet in the Hall of Supreme Harmony to entertain him. The following year, the Fifth Dalai Lama requested to return to Tibet. Emperor Shunzhi specially sent a prince to escort him to the Daiga area, and also sent the Minister of Rites with a golden book and a golden seal to the Fifth Dalai Lama, conferring upon him the title "The All-Good Self-Existing Buddha of the Western Heavens, Overseer of the Buddhist Faith Under Heaven, Universal Vajradhara Dalai Lama." From then on, with the strong support and promotion of the Qing emperors, the title of Dalai Lama became known throughout the world.

    After Shunzhi's death, Emperor Kangxi ascended the throne, and continued to send people to Tibet every year to visit the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, bringing letters and gifts from the Emperor. Kangxi also stipulated that 5,000 taels of silver should be allocated annually from the tax revenue of Dajianlu to the Dalai Lama to support the monks.

    In 1682, the Fifth Dalai Lama passed away at the Potala Palace. The Tibetan King (i.e., Desi) Sangye Gyatso acted tyrannically and monopolized power, secretly concealing the news of the death, falsely claiming that the Dalai was in seclusion and not seeing anyone, and even usurped the Dalai's position, replacing him. Emperor Kangxi, upon discovering this, sent a letter to Sangye, severely reprimanding and questioning him, saying: "If this is not the case, I will order the armies of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi to your city... do not regret it." Sangye, in fear, then sent people to Beijing to report to Emperor Kangxi that the Fifth Dalai Lama had long passed away, and that the Sixth Dalai Lama had been reincarnated and was fifteen years old.

    Sixth Dalai Lama: Tsangyang Gyatso
    Tsangyang Gyatso was born in 1683 (22nd year of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi reign), in Yushok, Lhoka. At the age of fifteen, he was selected by the Tibetan King Sangye as the reincarnate lama and welcomed to Lhasa. In 1701 (40th year of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi reign), Gushri Khan, the chieftain of the Mongol tribe, had a falling out with Sangye, and war broke out. Sangye was captured and executed. Gushri Khan's descendant, Lhazang Khan, appointed Lungtok to replace Sangye's position as Tibetan King, and sent people to Beijing to report to Emperor Kangxi the circumstances of Sangye's "rebellion," while also claiming that Tsangyang Gyatso, whom Sangye had installed, was not the true reincarnate lama of the Fifth Dalai Lama. Using the excuse that the Sixth Dalai Lama indulged in wine and women and did not observe the monastic rules, he requested that the Dalai be "abolished." Emperor Kangxi, deceived by Lhazang Khan and the Tibetan great serf owners, in 1706 "escorted" Tsangyang Gyatso to Beijing. It is said that Tsangyang Gyatso passed away on the shores of Qinghai Lake, at the age of twenty-four.

    After Tsangyang Gyatso left Lhasa, Lhazang Khan's scheme succeeded. He discussed with the Tibetan King Lungtok and, in 1707 (46th year of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi reign), installed Yeshe Gyatso as the Sixth Dalai Lama, welcoming him to the Potala Palace, for a total of eleven years. However, the Tibetan monks believed that Yeshe Gyatso was a false Dalai Lama and did not recognize him.

    Seventh Dalai Lama: Kelzang Gyatso
    Born in 1708 (47th year of the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi reign), died in 1757 (22nd year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign), at the age of fifty.

    Kelzang Gyatso was from Litang, Xikang. He became a monk at the age of eight. At the age of nine, Mongol monks from Qinghai welcomed him to Kumbum Monastery. At the age of twelve, the Qing Emperor officially conferred upon him the title of Seventh Dalai Lama and sent him to Lhasa. After taking the throne, he became a disciple of the Fifth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Yeshe, and entered Drepung Monastery to study sutras.
      In 1727 (5th year of the Qing Dynasty's Yongzheng reign), a rebellion broke out in Tibet. Kalon Ngabo and others killed the Tibetan King and prepared to unite with the Dzungars of Xinjiang to resist the Qing. The Qing court dispatched 15,000 cavalry and infantry to Tibet to quell the rebellion. In 1728, the Qing government decided to establish two resident ministers in Tibet, who would jointly manage Tibetan political affairs with the Dalai and Panchen Lamas.
  Kelzang Gyatso passed away in 1757 at the Potala Palace. Tibetan political and religious affairs were temporarily without a leader. The Qing Emperor then appointed Demo Hutuktu as regent to administer political affairs.

    Eighth Dalai Lama: Jamphel Gyatso
    Born in 1758 (23rd year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign), died in 1804 (9th year of the Qing Dynasty's Jiaqing reign), at the age of forty-seven.

    Jamphel Gyatso came from a noble family in Tobgye, in the Tsang region. At the age of five, he was recognized as a reincarnate lama and welcomed to the Potala Palace, becoming a disciple of the Sixth Panchen Lama, Palden Yeshe. At the age of twenty-four, the Qing Emperor ordered the Eighth Dalai Lama to assume power personally. In 1788 (53rd year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign), border disputes occurred between Tibet and Gorkha (Nepal). The Gorkha army invaded Tibet, and the Qing Dynasty sent troops to Tibet, defeating the Gorkhas and recovering lost Tibetan territory. Emperor Qianlong instructed the Qing army commander Fukangan: "After withdrawing the troops in the future, regulations must be properly established for permanent compliance." After Fukangan arrived in Lhasa, in 1793 (58th year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign), the Qing Emperor promulgated the Twenty-Nine Article Ordinance. The basic contents of the twenty-nine articles were:
  (1) Regulations on the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and other Hutuktus (meaning those who reincarnate generation after generation, titles of great lamas); (2) Regulations on the mutual relations and powers of the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and resident ministers; (3) Regulations on the appointment, removal, promotion, demotion, and treatment of officials (abbots) of the Tibetan local government (Kashag); (4) Regulations on the establishment of Tibetan local armed forces (Tibetan army); (5) Regulations on Tibetan local financial revenue, currency system, and corvée labor; (6) Regulations on reducing burdens, reducing old debts, land rents, and taxes; (7) Regulations on reforming the judiciary and establishing litigation procedures; (8) Regulations on the management of religious temples, the appointment and removal of khenpos, the support of monks, and the approval procedures for Qinghai and Mongolia to welcome Tibetan living Buddhas; (9) Regulations on foreign affairs, the management of foreign residents, foreign trade, and border entry and exit inspections. The Twenty-Nine Article Ordinance fully proves that the political and religious systems of Tibet were all stipulated by the Beijing central government. The Twenty-Nine Article Ordinance also stipulated that the Qing Emperor would set up a "Golden Urn" in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, and the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and other Hutuktus would be decided by drawing lots from the "Golden Urn" under the supervision of the resident minister.

    In 1804, the Eighth Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso, passed away at the Potala Palace. The Qing Emperor ordered Jilung Hutuktu to serve as regent.

    Ninth Dalai Lama: Lungtok Gyatso
    Born in 1805 (10th year of the Qing Dynasty's Jiaqing reign), died in 1815 (20th year of the Jiaqing reign), at the age of eleven.

    Lungtok Gyatso came from the family of a hereditary Tusi (local chieftain) in Denko, Xikang. At the age of nine, he was recognized as a reincarnate lama and welcomed from Xikang to Lhasa, residing temporarily at Gungtang Monastery. The regent Jilung, together with the Seventh Panchen Lama, Tenpai Nyima, and representatives of the three great monasteries, unanimously requested the resident minister to report to the Emperor to exempt him from drawing lots. Emperor Jiaqing specially dispatched General Teqing'e of Chengdu to Tibet to supervise and preside, and approved Lungtok Gyatso to ride in a yellow palanquin, use the seals of the previous Dalai Lamas, and awarded him 10,000 taels of silver. Lungtok Gyatso then became a disciple of the Seventh Panchen Lama.

    At this time, British imperialism had transformed India into a colony and began to invade Tibet. In 1811, the Governor-General of India, Minto, sent Manning to Tibet. Manning visited the Ninth Dalai Lama. From then on, the British were constantly active in the Tibetan border area. In 1815, Lungtok Gyatso was poisoned to death in the Potala Palace. He was only eleven years old at the time of his death.

    Tenth Dalai Lama: Tsultrim Gyatso
    Born in 1816 (21st year of the Qing Dynasty's Jiaqing reign), poisoned to death in 1837 (17th year of the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang reign), at the age of twenty-two.

    Tsultrim Gyatso was the son of the headman of Nabucun, Litang, Xikang. At that time, a total of three reincarnate lamas were found in Tibet. In 1823, Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty ordered that all three reincarnate lamas be sent to Lhasa, and a "Golden Urn Drawing Lots" ceremony be held in the Jokhang Temple. As a result, Tsultrim Gyatso was selected as the Tenth Dalai Lama. At the age of fourteen, he entered Drepung Monastery to study sutras. At the age of nineteen, he became a disciple of the Seventh Panchen Lama and was ordained. In 1837, he was poisoned to death in the Potala Palace.

    Eleventh Dalai Lama: Khedrup Gyatso
    Born in 1838 (18th year of the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang reign), poisoned to death in 1855 (5th year of the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng reign), at the age of eighteen.

    Khedrup Gyatso came from a wealthy family in Kangding (Dajianlu), Xikang. At that time, three reincarnate lamas were found, and drawing lots was required to decide. Under the supervision of the resident minister, Khedrup Gyatso was selected as the Dalai Lama. In 1842, he was welcomed into the Potala Palace and held an enthronement ceremony. The Qing Emperor specially sent Zhangjia Hutuktu to supervise, and allocated 10,000 taels of silver as usual for the ceremony. At the age of nine, he became a disciple of the Seventh Panchen Lama and was ordained. In 1852, Khedrup Gyatso, accompanied by the resident minister, departed from Lhasa and lectured on sutras in the major monasteries of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden. In 1855, the Qing Emperor ordered the Eleventh Dalai Lama to assume power personally. Less than a year after assuming power personally, the Eleventh Dalai Lama was poisoned to death in the Potala Palace in the winter of that year, at the age of eighteen. The Qing Emperor appointed Reting as regent.

    Twelfth Dalai Lama: Trinley Gyatso
    Born in 1856 (6th year of the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng reign), poisoned to death in 1875 (1st year of the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu reign), at the age of twenty.

    Trinley Gyatso came from the family of a great Tibetan nobleman, Lhalu (family of the Eighth Dalai Lama). At that time, three reincarnate lamas were selected, gathered in Lhasa, and presided over by the resident minister Manqing. Drawing lots was held at the Jokhang Temple, and the result was that Trinley Gyatso was selected as the Twelfth Dalai Lama. Because the Seventh Panchen Lama had died, the regent Reting Hutuktu shaved the reincarnate lama's head and gave him a Dharma name. At the age of nine, he became a disciple of Lobsang, the law throne of Ganden Monastery. In 1873, the Qing Emperor ordered the Twelfth Dalai Lama to assume power personally, and, following the usual practice, went to various monasteries to pay homage to the Buddha and lecture on sutras, returning the following year. In 1875, the Twelfth Dalai Lama was poisoned to death in the Potala Palace.

    Thirteenth Dalai Lama: Thubten Gyatso
    Born in 1876 (2nd year of the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu reign), died in 1933, at the age of fifty-eight.

    Thubten Gyatso came from a farmer's family in Langdun Village, east of Lhasa. After being recognized as a reincarnate lama, he was approved by the Qing Emperor to succeed as the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. The Eighth Panchen Lama, Tenpai Wangchuk, shaved his head and gave him a name, and he temporarily resided at Gungtang Monastery. In 1878, the Qing Emperor ordered Thubten Gyatso to be enthroned in Lhasa. The date and time were stipulated by the Qing Emperor, and the Qing Emperor, as usual, conferred the title of Duke on the new Dalai Lama's father and awarded him a jeweled hat.

    In 1879, British imperialists sent people from Qinghai to Tibet for "travel." The Tibetan monks and laity unanimously opposed this, and the Dalai and Panchen Lamas jointly submitted a public petition to the resident minister: "...However, upon investigation, the nature of foreigners is indeed not kind. They insult and destroy Buddhism and deceive the ignorant. It is difficult to get along with them. According to the common oath of all the monks and laity in Tibet, they are not allowed to enter Tibet. We will provide a written pledge and will never, generation after generation, regardless of life or death, allow entry into the country. If they come, troops will be dispatched to block them, and gentle words will be used to dissuade them. If they insist on being strong, we will fight them to the death...." This public petition is a declaration of the Tibetan people against imperialist aggression and is an important document of historical significance.

    In 1894, Thubten Gyatso was already nineteen years old, and the Qing Emperor ordered the Thirteenth Dalai Lama to assume power personally. The regent Demo then submitted his resignation, and the Dalai held a ceremony at the Potala Palace to personally assume power and begin his personal rule.

    In 1899 (25th year of the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu reign), the Thirteenth Dalai Lama submitted a memorial to the Qing Emperor, proposing measures to consolidate the Tibetan border and resist British imperialist aggression, hoping that the Qing Emperor would adopt them and resolve the issues. However, the Qing government did not support this proposal of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, which led to the British army invading Tibet twice in 1902 and 1904. The Dalai fled to Qinghai and then to Kulun. The Qing government was forced to sign the "Lhasa Treaty" with British imperialism. British imperialism thus obtained special privileges, and today a small handful of expansionists in India still vainly attempt to inherit these privileges. When the Dalai was in Kulun, the Qing government ordered the Dalai to enter Beijing for an "imperial audience." In the autumn of 1908, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama arrived in Beijing, met Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu, and resided at the Yellow Temple. The Dalai Lama requested Empress Dowager Cixi that he be allowed to submit memorials directly to the Qing Emperor on matters, without going through the resident minister. Cixi did not agree. Later, the Court of Colonial Affairs notified the Dalai Lama in writing: "By imperial edict: After returning to Tibet, it is hoped that you will strictly abide by the regulations of the suzerain state. All matters need not be reported directly to the Emperor. Report to the resident minister and request him to submit on your behalf, and await imperial instructions. This is the decree." A golden book was sent to the Dalai Lama, conferring upon him the title "Sincere and Obedient, Aiding Transformation, All-Good Self-Existing Buddha of the Western Heavens." When the Dalai Lama was in Beijing, the British Minister to China, Zhu Erdian, actively engaged with the Dalai Lama, attempting to use the Dalai Lama to achieve his goals of invading Tibet.

    In October 1909, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama returned to Tibet from Beijing, and his relationship with the resident minister deteriorated day by day. The Qing government transferred Sichuan troops to Tibet, and the Thirteenth Dalai Lama fled to India.

    After the Dalai Lama entered India from Yatung, he harbored some illusions about British imperialism and expressed gratitude and reliance on the Indian authorities. He then resided in Darjeeling and Kalimpong. From then on, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama embarked on the wrong path.

    In 1912, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and the Dalai Lama returned to Tibet from India and expelled the resident minister.

    The Dalai Lama and his upper-level group were not unaware of British imperialism's conspiracies to invade Tibet and interfere in its internal affairs. However, the Dalai Lama had already embarked on the wrong path, hoping to rely on the supplies and assistance of British imperialism to realize his dream of "Greater Tibet," so he allowed British imperialism to carry out its aggressive activities. When British imperialism actively interfered in Tibet's internal affairs and directly harmed the interests of the Dalai Lama and his upper-level group, they then began to lean towards the motherland again. In 1930, the Kuomintang government sent people to Lhasa, and the Dalai Lama spoke to the visitors about many issues. He said that the Kang-Tibetan disputes could be resolved peacefully, "All are Chinese territory, why distinguish between you and me. If we engage in armed conflict, it would be brothers fighting among themselves, which is not worth it." He also said:
  "The British have indeed had the intention of luring me, but I know that sovereignty cannot be lost, so I have been dealing with them tactfully, without giving them any rights." Later, the Dalai Lama appointed Chusang Tendzin and others to Nanjing to organize the Tibetan Office in Beijing, recognizing that Tibet is Chinese territory and a component part of China.

    In October 1933, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away at the Potala Palace, at the age of fifty-eight.

    Fourteenth Dalai Lama: Tenzin Gyatso
    Born in 1933, twenty-six years old this year. Born in a farmer's family in Qijia Village, Tangtse Township, forty miles south of Huangzhong County, Qinghai. He was found in 1938 and recognized as a reincarnate lama. In 1939, he was sent to Lhasa, and his entire family followed. On February 22, 1940, an enthronement ceremony was held at the Potala Palace. The Kuomintang government sent their so-called "Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission" Wu Zhongxin to Lhasa to preside over it. In the spring of 1951, Regent Taktra stepped down, and the Dalai Lama assumed power personally. His first important act after assuming power was to send a negotiating delegation to Beijing, indicating his determination to break free from the control of imperialism and return to the embrace of the motherland. He sent Kalon Ngabo Ngawang Jigme and four others as representatives to Beijing to hold negotiations. On May 23 of that year, a signing ceremony for the "Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" was held in the Qinren Hall in Beijing. After the agreement was signed, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa from Yatung on August 17, 1951. On October 26, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet also arrived in Lhasa and was warmly welcomed by the Tibetan monks and laity. Thus, the Tibetan people and nationality were freed from the control and plunder of imperialist forces and returned to the embrace of the motherland.

    On September 16, 1954, the Dalai Lama delivered a speech at the First National People's Congress. On December 22 of the same year, he spoke at the plenary session of the CPPCC, and on March 9, 1955, he spoke at the seventh meeting of the State Council, repeatedly expressing that he felt the warmth of the motherland and saw the bright future, and wholeheartedly supported the unity of the motherland.

    On April 22, 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was formally established, and the Dalai Lama served as the chairman of the committee. The Dalai Lama issued congratulatory messages every year on this day and on May 23, the day the agreement was signed, as well as on October 1, National Day. For example, on April 22, 1957, he gave a speech entitled "May everyone take on the task of completing the construction of a politically and religiously prosperous Tibet." On May 23 of the same year, he encouraged monks and laity with the topic "Strive to thoroughly implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement to build a politically and religiously prosperous, fulfilling, and happy Tibet." On October 1 of the same year, he again put forward the slogan "The Tibetan people should strive to strengthen patriotism—unity—progress on the existing basis."

    In the winter of 1956, the Dalai and Panchen Lamas were invited to India to attend the 2,500th anniversary of the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. They departed from Lhasa on November 20, passed through Shigatse, arrived in India, and met with Indian Prime Minister Nehru. They also visited Buddhist holy sites in Nepal and stayed in Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, for many days, returning to Lhasa on April 1, 1957.

    On March 10 this year, the Tibetan upper-level reactionary clique launched a rebellion, and the Fourteenth Dalai Lama was kidnapped to India by the traitorous group. Before he left Lhasa, he had written three letters to General Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet, expressing his anger at the rebels and his concern for his own life and safety.

    “达赖喇嘛”这个封号，是清朝顺治十年（1653年）由清朝政府正式册封的。1652年，五世达赖罗桑嘉错由西藏到北京朝见清朝皇帝。第二年，达赖返回西藏，清朝皇帝就正式册封他是“西天大善自在佛所领天下释教普通瓦赤喇怛喇达赖喇嘛”。从此，达赖喇嘛的称号就传下来了。
    但是，从五世达赖喇嘛起，就在西藏最反动的大农奴主的挟持威胁下，过着“傀儡”生活。更残酷的是，九世、十世、十一世、十二世，接连着四代达赖喇嘛都是在青年时被西藏大农奴主所害死。到了后一时期，西藏大农奴主又成为英帝国主义在西藏的代理人。
    英帝国主义侵略西藏，是远在五十年以前的清光绪30年间（1904年）。这年，英帝国主义向西藏发动了大规模的武装侵略，攻陷了拉萨。因为西藏人民坚决抵抗，英帝国主义就采取了更阴险恶毒的办法，标榜“帮助”西藏民族“独立”，实际上是企图使西藏人民由反对帝国主义转而反对祖国。并在西藏大农奴主当中培植了一批代理人。我们从下面的事略中，可以清楚地看到达赖喇嘛的封号、地位、职权和西藏地方政府组织的由来，以及西藏和祖国、西藏地方政府和中央政府的关系；同时也可以清楚地看到西藏大农奴主对达赖喇嘛的挟制、残杀和英帝国主义对西藏的侵略。
    一世达赖　根敦朱巴
    1391年（明洪武24年）生，1474年（明成化10年）逝世，八十四岁。
    根敦朱巴出身于后藏霞堆地方贫苦牧民的家庭，十五岁出家，拜团柱凯珠为师，学习红教。二十五岁到前藏云游，听黄教祖师宗喀巴讲经说法，深为钦佩，又拜宗喀巴为师。
    1447年（明正统12年）根敦朱巴得到桑主则（即日喀则）酋长的资助，在桑主则修建了札什伦布寺，寺成即任该寺“法台”（法台藏名池巴，就像后来庙中的住持）。当时噶丹寺法台克珠节（一世班禅）于1438年逝世，教务无人主持，寺僧派人来请根敦朱巴前往。根敦朱巴以札什伦布寺初建，不愿离去，另荐克珠节的弟弟去继任法台。1474年根敦朱巴即在后藏的札什伦布寺逝世。
    这时的西藏是受噶举派白教法王统治，噶举派帕摩主巴菩提幢在明永乐7年（1409）受封为阐化王。以后他的家族历代相承袭。
    二世达赖　根敦嘉错
    1475年（明成化11年）生，1542年（明嘉靖21年）逝世，六十七岁。
    根敦嘉错出身于后藏达纳地方的农民家中，十一岁时被札什伦布寺僧众迎至该寺，二十岁时由于与该寺法台不和，乃接受哲蚌寺法台的邀请，前往拉萨哲蚌寺学经。在哲蚌寺时曾往前后藏传法讲经。后来札什伦布寺的法台又率僧众前来迎请。根敦嘉错回去后，不数月仍回到拉萨。在拉萨担任了哲蚌寺的第十任法台，兼任色拉寺的第九任法台。1542年在哲蚌寺逝世。
    三世达赖　索南嘉错
    1543年（明嘉靖22年）生，1588年（明万历16年）逝世，四十六岁。
    索南嘉错出身前藏堆垅地方的农民家中。四岁时被僧众认为灵童迎至哲蚌寺供养。七岁时拜当时哲蚌寺法台索南札巴为师，十一岁时索南札巴退职，哲蚌寺僧众即公推索南嘉错为哲蚌寺第十二任法台。此后曾往札什伦布寺讲经，云游山南，返回拉萨，兼任色拉寺第十三任法台。
    1577年前往青海、西康等地传法讲经，历尽千辛万苦，才到达宗喀巴的故乡西宁附近。当时，蒙古可汗俺答（明朝封为顺义王）侵入青海，闻索南嘉错来，率众万人欢迎，上尊号“遍知一切瓦齐尔达赖喇嘛”。达赖喇嘛之名就从这时开始。
    当俺答率队东返土默特（今归绥一带）时，聘请索南嘉错前往内蒙传法。路过甘肃时，他接受了俺答的建议，致书明朝的宰相张居正：
  “释迦牟尼比丘锁南坚错贤吉祥，合掌顶礼朝廷，钦封干大国事阁下张，闻名显如日月，普天皆知，我保祐皇帝，昼夜念经，祝赞天下太平。压书礼物：四臂观世音一尊，氆氇二段，金刚结子一方，阁下吩咐顺义王（即俺答）早日回蒙，我当劝其遵命返回。”
    这是达赖喇嘛和北京中央政府官员打交道的开始。后来明神宗（万历16年）也派人来迎索南嘉错前往北京，不幸他于是年（1588年）在内蒙逝世，因之北京之行没有实现。
    四世达赖　云丹嘉错
    1589年（明万历17年）生，1616年（明万历44年）逝世，二十八岁。
    云丹嘉错出身于内蒙古图克隆汗部台吉（台吉，爵名）的家庭，十四岁时被迎请入藏，十五岁抵西藏北部热振寺，旋到哲蚌寺居住学经，拜当时噶丹寺法台根敦坚赞为师。1607年又到札什伦布寺，向当时任该寺法台的四世班禅罗桑曲结求法。1614年（明万历42年）云丹嘉错邀四世班禅前往哲蚌寺，并拜四世班禅为师。后来云丹嘉错应哲蚌寺僧众之请，任该寺第十三任法台兼色拉寺第十五任法台，1616年在哲蚌寺逝世。
    五世达赖　罗桑嘉错
    1617年（明万历45年）生，1682年（清康熙21年）逝世，六十六岁。
    罗桑嘉错出身于前藏山南琼结地方的勤苦农家。六岁时由三大寺僧众迎至哲蚌寺供养，九岁拜四世班禅为师。明崇祯15年五世达赖与四世班禅得到青海蒙古部落的酋长固始汗的帮助，取得了西藏政权，成为西藏宗教上政治上的领袖。
    这时正是明朝末年。后来清朝入关，顺治帝特派人到西藏问候达赖和班禅，并在各大寺放布施。达赖和班禅也派人到北京朝贺，献土仪。1651年顺治帝派了两个喇嘛到西藏邀请五世达赖到北京。1652年（清顺治9年）五世达赖率领藏官侍从等入京，顺治帝让达赖乘坐黄轿入都，住在黄寺；并在太和殿设宴款待。次年五世达赖请求返藏，顺治帝特派亲王护送至代噶地方，又派礼部尚书以金册金印送五世达赖，册封五世达赖为“西天大善自在佛所领天下释教普通瓦赤喇怛喇达赖喇嘛”。从此以后，经过清帝的大力支持和宣传，达赖喇嘛这个称号，才为举世所知。
    顺治死后，康熙即位，每年仍派人到西藏看望达赖和班禅，并带有皇帝的信件礼品。康熙还规定由打箭炉税收项下每年拨给达赖白银五千两，作为僧众养瞻。
    1682年五世达赖在布达拉宫逝世，藏王（即第巴）桑结跋扈专权，秘不发丧，伪言达赖静居不见人，竟窃取达赖的地位而代之。康熙帝发觉后，致书桑结严厉申斥责问，并说：“如其不然，且檄云南、四川、陕西之师，见汝城下，……其勿悔”。桑结惶恐，才把第五世早已逝世、第六世已转生十五岁的事派人到北京向康熙帝报告。
    六世达赖　仓央嘉错
    仓央嘉错生于1683年（清康熙22年），藏南宇松地方人。十五岁时被藏王桑结选为灵童，迎至拉萨。1701年（清康熙40年），蒙古部落固始汗与桑结交恶，爆发战争，桑结被俘处死。固始汗的后人拉藏汗另委隆素为藏王代替桑结的职权，一面派人赴北京向康熙帝报告桑结“谋反”的经过，同时奏称桑结所立的仓央嘉错不是真五世达赖灵童。并借口六世达赖耽于酒色，不守清规，请予“废立”。康熙帝受了拉藏汗和西藏大农奴主的蒙蔽，于1706年将仓央嘉错“解送”北京。据说仓央嘉错行至青海海滨逝世，年二十四岁。
    仓央嘉错离拉萨后，拉藏汗奸计得逞，与藏王隆素商议，于1707年（清康熙46年）另立伊西嘉错为达赖六世，迎至布达拉宫，前后达十一年。但西藏僧众认为伊西嘉错是假达赖，不予承认。
    七世达赖　噶桑嘉错
    1708年（清康熙47年）生，1757年（清乾隆22年）逝世，五十岁。
    噶桑嘉错，西康理塘人。八岁出家，九岁时青海蒙古僧众迎至塔尔寺，十二岁时清帝正式册封为七世达赖，送到拉萨。坐床后，拜五世班禅罗桑益喜为师，入哲蚌寺学经。
      1727年（清雍正5年）西藏发
  生叛乱，噶伦阿尔布巴等将藏王杀死，并准备与新疆准噶尔人联合抗清，清廷调派马步兵一万五千人入藏平定叛乱。1728年清政府决定在西藏设驻藏大臣正副二人，与达赖、班禅共同管理西藏政务。
  1757年七世达赖在布达拉宫逝世，藏中政教一时无人主持，清帝乃命第穆诺门汗为摄政，代行政务。
    八世达赖　强白嘉错
    1758年（清乾隆23年）生，1804年（清嘉庆9年）逝世，年四十七岁。
    强白嘉错出身于后藏托布加地方的贵族家中，五岁时被认为灵童，迎至布达拉宫，拜六世班禅巴丹益喜为师。二十四岁时，清帝命令八世达赖亲政。1788年（清乾隆53年）西藏与廓尔喀（尼泊尔）之间发生了边境纠纷，廓尔喀军侵入西藏，清朝派兵入藏，击败了廓尔喀人，收复西藏失地，乾隆帝指示清军统帅福康安：“将来撤兵后，必当妥立章程，以期永远遵循。”福康安到拉萨后，1793年（清乾隆58年）清帝即颁行钦定章程二十九条。二十九条的基本内容有：
  （1）关于达赖、班禅及其他呼图克图（呼图克图世世转生之意，大喇嘛名号）灵童转世问题的规定；（2）关于达赖、班禅与驻藏大臣的相互关系及职权问题的规定；  （3）关于西藏地方政府（噶厦）官员（住持）任免、升降、待遇等问题的规定；（4）关于建立西藏地方部队（藏军）问题的规定；（5）关于西藏地方财政税收、币制及差役等问题的规定；（6）关于减免负担，减免旧欠地租赋税问题的规定；（7）关于整顿司法和建立诉讼手续的规定；（8）关于宗教寺庙的管理，堪布任免，僧众供养以及青海、蒙古迎请西藏活佛的批准手续等问题的规定；（9）关于外事、外侨管理、对外贸易以及边界出入检查等问题的规定。二十九条章程充分证明了：西藏的政治制度、宗教制度，都是由北京中央政府规定的。二十九条章程还规定：清朝皇帝在拉萨大昭寺内设一“金本巴瓶”，达赖、班禅以及其他呼图克图灵童转世，均由驻藏大臣主持，用“金本巴瓶”掣签决定。
    1804年，八世达赖强白嘉错在布达拉宫逝世，清帝命济咙呼图克图摄政。
    九世达赖　隆朵嘉错
    1805年（清嘉庆10年）生，1815年（嘉庆20年）逝世，十一岁。
    隆朵嘉错出身于西康邓柯地方的土司世袭的土官家庭。九岁时被认为灵童，由西康迎至拉萨，在公塘寺暂住。一面由摄政济咙会同七世班禅丹白尼马和三大寺代表，一致向驻藏大臣要求，请奏明皇上，免予掣签。嘉庆帝特派成都将军特清额赴藏监督主持，并批准隆朵嘉错乘黄轿，用前辈达赖印信，赏银一万两。隆朵嘉错即拜七世班禅为师。
    这时英帝国主义已变印度为殖民地，开始向西藏进行侵略。1811年印度总督明多派曼宁入藏，曼宁曾去朝拜九世达赖。从此英国人便不断在藏边活动。1815年隆朵嘉错在布达拉宫被人毒害而死，死时才十一岁。
    十世达赖　楚臣嘉错
    1816年（清嘉庆21年）生，1837年（清道光17年）被毒死，二十二岁。
    楚臣嘉错是西康理塘地方那布村头人的儿子。当时西藏找到的灵童共有三人。1823年清道光帝下令，将三个灵童都送到拉萨，在大昭寺内举行“金瓶掣签”，结果楚臣嘉错被抽定为达赖十世。十四岁时入哲蚌寺学经，十九岁时拜七世班禅为师，受戒。1837年在布达拉宫又被毒害而死。
    十一世达赖　凯珠嘉错
    1838年（清道光18年）生，1855年（清咸丰5年）被毒死，十八岁。
    凯珠嘉错出身于西康康定（打箭炉）富户家。当时找到了三个灵童，须待抽签决定。在驻藏大臣主持下，结果抽定了凯珠嘉错。1842年被迎入布达拉宫，举行坐床典礼。清帝特派章嘉呼图克图前来监视，并照例拨银一万两为典礼用费。九岁时拜七世班禅为师，受戒。1852年凯珠嘉错由驻藏大臣陪同自拉萨出发，到色拉、哲蚌、噶丹各大寺讲经说法。1855年清帝命十一世达赖亲政。十一世达赖亲政后不到一年，就在这一年的冬季在布达拉宫被毒死，年十八岁。清帝命热振担任摄政。
    十二世达赖　成烈嘉错
    1856年（清咸丰6年）生，1875年（清光绪元年）被毒死，二十岁。
    成烈嘉错出身于西藏大贵族拉鲁（达赖八世家属）家。当时选定灵童三人，齐集拉萨，由驻藏大臣满庆主持，在大昭寺抽签，结果决定成烈嘉错为十二世达赖。因七世班禅已死，由摄政热振呼图克图为灵童剃发取法名，九岁时拜噶丹寺法台罗桑为师。1873年清帝命十二世达赖亲政，循例前往各寺朝佛讲经，次年归来。1875年十二世达赖又在布达拉宫被毒死。
    十三世达赖　土登嘉错
    1876年（清光绪2年）生，1933年逝世，五十八岁。
    土登嘉错出身于拉萨东部朗敦村农民家，被认为灵童后，经清帝批准继任为十三世达赖，由八世班禅丹白旺觉替他剃发、取名，暂住在公塘寺。1878年清帝命土登嘉错到拉萨坐床。月日时间均由清帝规定，清帝照例加封新达赖的父亲为公爵，赏戴宝石顶子。
    1879年英帝国主义派人由青海入藏“游历”，西藏僧俗一致反对，由达赖、班禅领衔给驻藏大臣上了公禀：“……惟查洋人之性，实非善良，侮灭佛教，欺哄愚人，断难相处。兹据全藏僧俗共立誓词，不准入藏，出具切结，从此世世不顾生死，永远不准入境，如有来者，各路派兵阻挡，善言劝阻，相安无事。如或逞强，即拼命相敌。……”这个公禀就是西藏人民反对帝国主义侵略的宣言，是有历史意义的重要文件。
    1894年，土登嘉错已经十九岁，清帝下令要十三世达赖亲政。次年摄政第穆提出辞呈，达赖在布达拉宫举行亲政大典，开始亲政。
    1899年（清光绪25年）十三世达赖向清帝上了一个奏折，提出巩固西藏边疆，抵抗英帝国主义侵略的办法，希望清帝采纳，予以解决。但清政府对于十三世达赖这个建议，未予支持，以致1902年、1904年英军两次侵略西藏，达赖出走青海，转赴库伦。清政府被迫与英帝国主义订立了“拉萨条约”。英帝国主义从此取得了特权，今天印度一小撮扩张主义分子还妄想继承这种特权。达赖在库伦时清政府命达赖入京“陛见”。1908年秋，十三世达赖到了北京，见了慈禧太后和光绪皇帝，住在黄寺。达赖向慈禧太后提出请求，希望遇事直接向清帝上奏，不要通过驻藏大臣。慈禧没有答应。后来由理藩院用书面通知达赖：“奉上谕：回藏之后，更望恪遵主国典章，所有事务，勿庸直接奏明皇帝，具报驻藏大臣请其代奏，静候敕裁，钦此。”送给达赖金册，册封达赖为“诚顺赞化西天大善自在佛”。达赖在北京时，英国驻华公使朱尔典，积极对达赖进行活动，企图利用达赖，以达到其侵略西藏的目的。
    1909年10月，十三世达赖由北京返藏，与驻藏大臣的关系日趋恶化；清政府调川军入藏，十三世达赖出走印度。
    达赖从亚东进入印度境内以后，对英帝国主义存着一些幻想，对于印度当局表示感激，依存，以后即住在大吉岭和噶伦堡。从此十三世达赖走上了错误的道路。
    1912年辛亥革命爆发，达赖从印度返藏，驱逐了驻藏大臣。
    英帝国主义对西藏的侵略和干涉内政等阴谋活动，达赖及其上层集团不是不知道的。但是，达赖既已走上了错误的道路，幻想依靠英帝国主义的供给援助，实现“大西藏”的梦想，所以听任英帝国主义进行侵略活动。到了英帝国主义积极干涉西藏内政，直接危害到达赖及其上层集团的利益时，才又开始倾向祖国。1930年国民党政府派人到拉萨，达赖向来人谈了很多问题。他说康藏纠纷可以和平解决，“都是中国领土，何分尔我，倘武力相持，兄弟阋墙，甚为不值”。他又说：
  “英国人对吾确有诱惑之念，但吾知主权不可失，故虚与周旋，未予以分厘权利。”后来，达赖委派楚臣丹增等人到南京，组织了西藏驻京办事处，承认西藏是中国的领土，是中国的一个组成部分。
    1933年10月，十三世达赖在布达拉宫逝世，年五十八岁。
    十四世达赖　丹增嘉措
    1933年生，今年二十六岁。生于青海湟中县南四十里地方的当采乡祁家川的农民家中，1938年被寻获，认为灵童。1939年送至拉萨，全家随往。1940年2月22日在布达拉宫举行坐床典礼，国民党政府派他们的所谓“蒙藏委员会委员长”吴忠信到拉萨去主持。1951年春，摄政大札下台，达赖亲政。亲政后第一个重要表现，就是派谈判代表来京；这表示他有决心要挣脱帝国主义的控制，回到祖国的怀抱中来。他派噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美等五人为代表来北京举行谈判。在同年5月23日在北京勤政殿举行了
  “中央人民政府与西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的签字仪式。协议签订以后，十四世达赖在1951年8月17日自亚东返回拉萨，10月26日人民解放军驻藏部队也到达拉萨，受到西藏僧俗人民隆重欢迎。至此，西藏民族和人民摆脱了帝国主义势力的控制和掠夺，回到了祖国大家庭的怀抱。
    1954年9月16日，达赖喇嘛在第一届全国人民代表大会上发言，同年12月22日在政协全体会议上发言和1955年3月9日在国务院全体会议第七次会议上讲话，都屡次表示受到祖国大家庭的温暖，看到他们未来的光明前途，衷心拥护祖国的统一。
    1956年4月22日，西藏自治区筹备委员会正式成立，达赖喇嘛担任主任委员。在每年这一天和签订协定的5月23日以及10月1日国庆节达赖都发表祝词。如1957年4月22日，他以“愿大家承担起完成建设政教昌隆的西藏的任务”为题发表谈话；在同年5月23日，他以“彻底执行十七条协议为建设政教两盛圆满幸福的西藏而努力”为题鼓励僧俗人民；同年10月1日他又提出“西藏人民在已有的基础上努力加强爱国——团结——进步”的口号。
    1956年冬天，达赖和班禅应邀前往印度参加释迦牟尼涅槃二千五百周年纪念大会，在11月20日从拉萨起身，经过日喀则到达印度，会见了印度总理尼赫鲁。又到尼泊尔境内参观佛教圣地，在锡金首都刚渡留住多日，到1957年4月1日回到拉萨。
    今年3月10日，西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱，十四世达赖喇嘛被叛国集团劫往印度。在他未离开拉萨前，还曾三次写信给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军，表示了他对叛乱分子的愤怒和对他自己的生命安全的担忧。
