    Accusations of Blood and Tears
    By Guo Chaoren, Xinhua News Agency Reporter

    --A Tibetan youth said: "We know best who are the ferocious beasts and who are the kind-hearted Bodhisattvas. Without the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, even if I had a hundred lives, they would all have been killed by those headmen!"

The Tibetan people, who have suffered cruel tortures from the reactionary feudal lords, made accusations of blood and tears against the dark and cruel feudal serf system. The reporter recently interviewed several people, and their tragic experiences fully demonstrate how brutal and vicious a handful of reactionaries were, with absolutely no humanity.

A Tibetan youth wearing dark glasses, leaning on a crutch, groped his way to me. He took my hand and stood there blankly, unable to say a word. After a long time, he took off his glasses, and I saw that the youth had no eyeballs; his eye sockets were deep, and his upper and lower eyelids were stuck together.

His name is Bada, a herdsman from the Heihe Grassland. Bada told me that his family had never owned any cattle or sheep for generations, and the whole family worked for the masters all year round, bearing heavier labor than cattle and horses. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, Bada, ignoring the obstruction of the reactionary headmen, participated in the construction project of the Heihe-Qamdo highway, and only then began to live a human life for the first time. However, the headmen hated him to the bone, calling him a "devil on the grassland," because working for the Communist Party violated the "rules" of the Living Buddha, and they often wanted to find an opportunity to "punish" Bada.

On January 15 this year (the sixth day of the twelfth month of the Tibetan calendar last year), Bada went to a tribe called Ya'ando in northern Tibet to invite a mobile doctor to treat a companion who was building the road. When passing under the Gara Mountain, he was captured by several reactionary headmen. These headmen were leading an armed bandit gang, preparing to attack the road construction organization, so they grabbed Bada and asked him to confess the situation of the organization's personnel, weapons, etc., as "repentance" to the Living Buddha. Bada refused at the time. The headmen then tied his limbs straight to a wooden frame, one headman grabbed Bada's hair, two headmen placed large wooden sticks on his chest and stomped on them with their feet, and one headman used sharpened bamboo needles to stab his buttocks.

Bada was tortured to the point of near death, but he still gritted his teeth and refused to betray his organization and comrades. He said to the headman: "The Communist Party saved me from hell, I cannot be without conscience. You can kill me, but you will not get my heart!"

The reactionary headman sneered, picked up two sharp stones from the ground, and pressed them hard on Bada's temples. Under the heavy pressure, Bada's eyeballs bulged out. At this time, a headman named Woda Rongdeng grabbed Bada's eyeballs and pulled them out. Bada's eyes flashed with colorful golden stars, he felt cold all over, and his head seemed to explode. But he clearly remembered that Woda Rongdeng grabbed his eyeballs and pulled them for a while, then cut them with a small copper knife (called "Kanbei" locally, shaped like a spoon), and Bada fainted.

When Bada woke up, he was in complete darkness, and his eye sockets were burning like fire. Blood and cold sweat soaked his old sheepskin coat. However, the reactionary headmen did not give up and stripped off his clothes and whipped him with leather whips.

Bada said that he was tortured for fourteen days. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army troops arrived and saved his life. The doctors of the People's Liberation Army healed Bada's wounds, and the Heihe Sub-district Committee of the Communist Party of China gave Bada's family more than two thousand catties of grain and a large number of daily necessities. A few days ago, he was sent to Lhasa for further treatment.

Bada said: "We know best who are the ferocious beasts and who are the kind-hearted Bodhisattvas. Without the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, even if I had a hundred lives, they would all have been killed by those headmen!"

Another old man also suffered the same fate as Bada.

His name is Aliya. Before speaking, Aliya took out a foot-long thick iron wire from his arms and showed it to me. It turned out that the headman Lamuqu used a red-hot iron wire like this to burn his eyeballs.

The incident happened in June last year.

In order to help the Tibetan people, who have used cow dung and wood as fuel for generations, fundamentally solve the difficulty of fuel supply, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a survey team to various places to find coal mines. When the survey team came to Anduo Maima (place name) in northern Tibet, the local headman ordered the people: "The Communist Party is here to steal our treasures, no one is allowed to lead the way for them and no one is allowed to report mines to them."

People knew that the headman was lying, but no one dared to say anything. Aliya thought: What a great thing it would be if the Tibetan people also had coal mines! So, he secretly found the survey team and led the way for the survey team, and finally found several coal mines in the local mountains.

However, Aliya's behavior angered the reactionary headman. The headman said that he led the Communist Party to destroy the "holy mountain," tied him to a rock, and beat him with wooden sticks. After hitting him for several hours, the headmen still did not vent their hatred. A headman named Lamuqu brought a thick iron wire from home, put it on the stove for half an hour, and the iron wire was burned red. The headman wrapped one end in cowhide, picked it up, and stabbed it into Aliya's eye socket. With a sharp pain, Aliya's right eyeball was burned instantly. His left eye was also scalded with blood and pus. After the rescue by the doctors of the People's Liberation Army, the left eye retained a little faint vision.

Aliya waved the iron wire in his hand and said to the reporter: "The wolf eats people, but the heart of the headman is more vicious than the wolf!"

The forty-year-old painter Langjie Pengcuo burst into tears from time to time when telling about his experiences. He had been forced by the Tibetan government to become homeless and suffered all kinds of torture.

Fifteen years ago (in the Tibetan Iron Dragon Year), the Tibetan government discovered a case of counterfeiting gold bars, but because the person involved was rich and powerful, they did not dare to pursue it. Coincidentally, Langjie Pengcuo was gilding Buddhist statues for the temple at the order of his master, so the Tibetan government framed Langjie Pengcuo with this crime.

The Tibetan government put dozens of catties of heavy iron shackles on Langjie Pengcuo and locked him in prison for forty-eight days, and whipped him with leather whips every day.

Because Langjie Pengcuo was unwilling to bear the crimes of others, the Tibetan government put him in a wooden cage for "public display." The wooden cage was one of the Tibetan government's instruments of torture. The whole body was locked in the wooden cage, the head was left outside the wooden cage and could not move, and a stone hat weighing more than thirty catties was placed on the top of the head.

After Langjie Pengcuo was "displayed" for seven days, the Tibetan government implemented a new type of punishment: using a knife to cut several cracks in the palm of Langjie Pengcuo's right hand, then stuffing salt and fine sand into the wounds, then gathering the five fingers together, wrapping them with wet cowhide and sewing them shut. If this kind of punishment is applied for a long time, the palm and fingers will stick together and cannot be separated, forming a hoof-like shape.

Langjie Pengcuo stretched out his right hand to me. Although he had been treated by doctors repeatedly, the numerous scars on his palm were still clearly visible.

Langjie Pengcuo said: All kinds of punishments had been used. Finally, the Tibetan government stripped off his clothes and put on "lifelong iron shackles" weighing more than thirty catties. These iron shackles tightly wrapped a thick iron bar around his shin, and then used a furnace fire to burn the joints of the iron bar together, so that the prisoner could never take it off.

Then, the Tibetan government formally sentenced Langjie Pengcuo to exile in the desolate northern Tibetan grasslands. All of Langjie Pengcuo's property was confiscated by the Tibetan government, his parents were forced to death by the Tibetan government, and his wife was forced to separate.

Langjie Pengcuo wandered on the northern Tibetan grasslands for fifteen years, and only returned to Lhasa today. He told reporters: "Although the Tibetan government has been eliminated, the hatred in my heart will never be eliminated!"

    血泪的控诉
    新华社记者　郭超人
    ——一位藏族青年说：“谁是凶恶的野兽，谁是善心的菩萨，我们这些人最清楚。没有共产党，解放军，我就是有一百条命也会全被头人们弄死！”
    曾经惨遭反动农奴主酷刑毒害的西藏人民，对黑暗残酷的农奴制度作了血泪的控诉。记者最近访问了几个人，从他们悲惨的遭遇中，充分表明了一小撮反动分子是多么凶残毒辣，毫无人性。
    一个眼戴墨镜的藏族青年，手扶拐杖，摸索着走到我跟前。他拉着我的手，痴痴地站立着，说不出一句话来。许久，才用手取下了自己的眼镜，我才看到，青年的一双眼珠没有了，眼眶深陷，上下眼皮粘在一起。
    他名叫白达，是黑河草原上的牧民。白达告诉我，他家世世代代都没有自己的牛羊，全家人终年为主人放牧，担负着比牛马还沉重的劳动。西藏和平解放后，白达不顾反动头人们的阻挠，参加了黑河—昌都公路的修筑工程，才第一次开始过人的生活。但是，头人却对他恨之入骨，说他是“草原上的魔鬼”，因为为共产党做事，就触犯了佛爷的“规矩”，时常想找机会“惩罚”白达。
    今年1月15日（藏历去年十二月初六），白达到藏北一个名叫雅安多的部落去请一位巡回医疗的医生，为修路的一个同伴治病。经过加拉山下时，被几个反动头人捉住了。这几个头人正带领一支武装叛匪，准备攻打修路机关，便抓住白达，要他招供机关人员、武器等情况，作为对佛爷的“忏悔”，白达当时拒绝。头人们便把他的四肢拉直绑在木架上，一个头人扯住白达的头发，两个头人用大木棍放在他的胸口上，用两脚猛踩，一个头人用削尖的竹针刺他的臀部。
    白达被折磨得死去活来，仍咬着牙关，不肯出卖自己的机关和同志，他向头人说：“共产党把我从地狱中救了出来，我不能没有良心，你们能打死我这个人，却得不到我这颗心！”
    反动头人狞笑了一声，从地上抓起两块尖石头，用力挤压白达两边太阳穴。在重压下，白达的双眼珠凸突出来，这时一个名叫窝达融登的头人，用手指抓住白达的眼珠往外拉扯。白达的眼前迸跳着五颜六色的金星，他浑身发冷，脑袋好像要炸裂似的。但他还清楚地记得，窝达融登抓着他的眼珠扯了一阵，然后用一把小铜刀（在当地叫做“堪贝”，形如汤匙）一割，白达便昏迷过去了。
    当白达苏醒过来，他眼前一片漆黑，他的眼眶像火烧一样。鲜血和冷汗浸湿了他的老羊皮袄。但是，反动头人们还不罢休，又把他的衣服脱光，用皮鞭抽打。
    白达说，他整整被折磨了十四天，幸亏人民解放军部队赶来，才救了他的命。人民解放军的医生为白达治好了伤口，中共黑河分工委又给白达家里救济了两千多斤粮食和大量生活用品，前些天，他又被送到拉萨作进一步的治疗。
    白达说：“谁是凶恶的野兽，谁是善心的菩萨，我们这些人最清楚。没有共产党，解放军，我就是有一百条命也会全被头人们弄死！”
    还有一个苍迈的老人，也遭到与白达同样的命运。
    他叫阿里雅。在没有讲话之前，阿里雅从怀里掏出一根一尺长的粗铁丝比着给我看。原来，头人拉木曲用像这样的铁丝烧红后，烫焦了他的眼珠。
    事情发生在去年6月。
    为了帮助世代用牛粪和木材作燃料的西藏人民，从根本上解决燃料供应的困难，中共西藏工委派出一支勘查队到各地寻找煤矿。当勘查队来到藏北安多买马（地名）时，当地头人便给老百姓下令说：“共产党是来抢我们宝贝的，谁也不许为他们带路和不许为他们报矿。”
    人们都知道头人说的是假话，但是谁也不敢啃气。阿里雅想：如果西藏老百姓也有了煤矿，该是多大的好事呵！于是，他偷偷地找到了勘查队，为勘查队带路，终于在当地山岭间找到了几处煤矿。
    但是，阿里雅的行为却触怒了反动头人。头人说他带领共产党破坏了“圣山”，把他捆在石岩上用木棍抽打。打了几个小时，头人们还不泄恨。一个叫拉木曲的头人，从家里拿来一根粗铁丝，放在火炉上烧了半个时辰，铁丝烧得通红，头人用牛皮包住一头，拿起来刺进阿里雅的眼眶，一阵剧痛，阿里雅的右眼珠顿时被烧焦了，他的左眼也被烫伤流血流脓，经过人民解放军医生的抢救，左眼才保留着一点微弱的视力。
    阿里雅挥动着手中铁丝向记者说：“饿狼是吃人的，头人的心比饿狼还毒辣！”
    四十多岁的画匠朗杰彭错在诉说他的遭遇时，不时放声大哭起来。他曾经被藏政府逼得无家可归，受尽了酷刑的折磨。
    十五年前（在藏历铁龙年），藏政府发现了一件伪造金条的案子，但因为当事人有钱有势，不敢追究，刚巧朗杰彭错当时正奉主人之命为寺庙佛像涮金，于是藏政府便把这个罪名横栽在朗杰彭错头上。
    藏政府给朗杰彭错带上几十斤重的大铁镣，在监狱里关了四十八天，每天还用皮鞭抽打。
    由于朗杰彭错不愿承担别人的罪名，藏政府便把他装在木囚笼里“示众”。木囚笼是藏政府的刑具之一，全身被锁在木笼里面，脑袋留在木笼外不能动弹，头顶再戴上一具三十多斤重的石帽。
    朗杰彭错被“示众”了七天之后，藏政府又施行新的刑法：用刀把朗杰彭错的右手掌割开几个裂缝，然后把盐巴和细砂塞进伤口，再把五指攒拢，外用湿牛皮包扎缝死。施用这种刑法如果时间较长，则手掌手指就粘连在一块，不能分开，弄成牛蹄般形状。
    朗杰彭错向我伸出右手，虽然经过医生反复治疗，但手掌上的累累伤痕还看得很清楚。
    朗杰彭错说：一切刑法都用过了，藏政府最后把他衣服剥下来，套上三十多斤重的“终生铁镣”，这种铁镣是将一根粗铁条紧紧缠上脚胫以后，再用炉火将铁条接缝处烧红熔在一起，囚犯永远也不能把它退脱。
    然后，藏政府正式判决，将朗杰彭错流放到荒凉的藏北草原。朗杰彭错的家产全部被藏政府没收，父、母亲被藏政府逼死，妻子被逼离散。
    朗杰彭错在藏北草原流浪了十五年，直到今天才回到拉萨，他告诉记者说：“藏政府虽然消灭了，但是我心头的仇恨却永远也消灭不了！”
