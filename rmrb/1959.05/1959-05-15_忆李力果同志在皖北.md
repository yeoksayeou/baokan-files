	Remembering Comrade Li Liguo in Northern Anhui
	Ye Qiu
	Just as I entered the office, a comrade told me that Comrade Liguo had passed away. I quickly flipped through the newspaper and indeed saw his obituary.

	I couldn't help but recall some of his past experiences:

	In the early spring of 1928, the Northern Anhui Special Committee held an enlarged meeting. Comrade Dai Zhujiu and I represented the Party Committee of Huoqiu County and went to Fuyang to attend the meeting. Due to delays in communication and delivery at the time, we arrived the day after the enlarged meeting had ended. In the evening, Wei Yechou, the secretary of the Special Committee (then using the alias Wei Jin, an early disseminator of Marxism in northern Shaanxi and one of the founders of the Party), spoke with us all night, giving detailed instructions on the deployments of the Northern Anhui Special Committee. A small oil lamp, three short stools, and a stack of documents on a broken stool beside us. Comrade Wei Jin explained that after the establishment of the Northern Anhui Special Committee, they had established contact with the Southern Henan Special Committee, and through the Southern Henan Special Committee, they had connected with the Party Central Committee, receiving instructions and documents from the Central Committee. We had not heard from the Central Committee for almost half a year. We listened eagerly to Comrade Wei Jin's clear and forceful communication, only hating that time passed so quickly, only hating that the rooster crowed so early. Just as dawn broke, we left his place, leaving us with an unforgettable impression.

	That evening, Qiao Jingqing, the secretary of the Fuyang County Committee, invited us to dinner. There were comrades who were still in Yang Hucheng's troops, as well as Comrade Li Liefei (that is, Comrade Li Liguo). At that time, they were all young men around twenty years old, full of vigor. Although Chiang Kai-shek was massacring communists everywhere, and all the Northern Expeditionary Army units were purging the Party, the garrison in Fuyang at that time was Yang Hucheng's troops. Because Comrade Wei Jin had long served as the director of the political department in Yang's army and had sown many revolutionary seeds, Fuyang still had revolutionary slogans everywhere, the sounds of the Internationale, and children still singing "Down with the great powers, down with the great powers, eliminate the warlords! Eliminate the warlords!" We were in a room in the restaurant, talking enthusiastically, full of confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolution, with the air of "vanquishing enemies and destroying their strongholds while chatting and laughing."

	We returned to Huoqiu from Fuyang, bringing back great encouragement. In two months, from about ten people, we developed Party and League organizations in all major market towns throughout the county. On April 8th of that year, the "Fuyang Uprising" broke out, raising the first red flag of the Northern Anhui Soviet in the Liuji area of Fuyang. Tens of thousands of people participated in the struggle of "distributing grain and eating from the rich," igniting a raging fire in northern Anhui. Unfortunately, not long after, we heard the news of the failure of the Fuyang Uprising, and the news of the sacrifice of Comrade Wei Jin, Comrade Qiao Jingqing, and others. Just as we were extremely anxious, Comrade Li Liefei came to Huoqiu. I still remember very clearly that he was disguised in a tattered gown, with a pair of old pants over his military trousers. There were two bullet holes in the crotch of his military trousers. He had broken through the enemy's encirclement from a hail of bullets.

	Comrade Liefei stayed in Huoqiu. He participated in the work of the County League Committee, serving as the organization committee member, and lived in the courtyard of a temple in the county town. This was the county committee's office, and a Henan person also lived there, acting as a "liaison." I stole a small stove and rice and flour from home, and he cooked in a vegetable box. I often saw him making "cat ear" noodles in his palm. Life was difficult, but his revolutionary optimism was always soaring.

	Chiang Kai-shek's massacre and the sacrifice of many leaders of the Fuyang Uprising aroused our infinite anger. Coupled with the leadership of the "left"-leaning line, our Huoqiu County Committee decided to launch demonstrations throughout the county. Around June of that year, leaflets were distributed simultaneously in all major market towns throughout the county overnight. Comrade Liefei and I were responsible for the distribution work in the city. He was arrested by an officer of the enemy's garrison headquarters while posting leaflets late at night. In the nick of time, he cleverly escaped the enemy's arrest. The next day, he sneaked out of the city, where we explained the work, and several comrades who were too "red" fled to Shanghai to find Party connections, utterly destitute. Later, he actually obtained twenty yuan for travel expenses through a fellow villager, even took a trip to West Lake, and then returned to northern Shaanxi, transferred to Beijing, and later served in the Party's municipal committee in Beijing. Afterwards, we intermittently heard that he had been arrested, and we lost contact.

	In 1947, I arrived in the liberated area and inquired about him everywhere. Later, I learned that he was still alive and had changed his name to Li Liguo.

	After entering Beijing in 1949, I continued to inquire about his whereabouts. One day, I suddenly learned from the hospital that he was recuperating nearby. At this time, he was suffering from almost hopeless cirrhosis, but when we met again after more than twenty years, his high degree of revolutionary optimism was still undiminished. He showed no sign of sadness or worry about his serious condition. He desperately hoped to get better and do more work for the Party and the people. When his condition slightly improved, he actively asked the Party for work. After arriving at the Ministry of Machine Building, he initially obeyed the doctor's restrictions and worked only half a day, but gradually broke these restrictions. Sometimes he didn't return home until very late at noon, and sometimes he was still in meetings at night. Every time I saw him, he always smiled and expressed his heartfelt joy at being able to work for the Party again.

	Comrade Liguo's revolutionary optimism will always inspire us to move forward!

    忆李力果同志在皖北
    冶秋
    刚刚进到办公室，一位同志告诉我，力果同志死了，我赶忙翻开报纸一看，的确是登了他去世的讣告。
    我不禁想起他的一些往事：
    1928年的初春，皖北特委召开了一次扩大会议，我和戴铸九同志代表霍丘党的县委会，去阜阳参加会议。由于当时的交通送信的延误，我们赶到的时候，扩大会已于头一天结束了。晚上特委书记魏野畴同志（当时化名魏金，是陕北最早的马克思主义传布者，党的创始人之一）找我们谈了一个通宵，把皖北特委的部署作了详尽的指示。一盏小油灯，三个矮板凳，旁边一个破凳子上，摆着一叠文件。魏金同志把皖北特委建立以后，同豫南特委发生联系，通过豫南特委，同党中央接上了关系，得到了中央的指示和文件。我们差不多有半年没有听到中央的指示了。我们如饥似渴的听着魏金同志明确有力的传达，只恨时间过得快，只恨鸡叫得太早。天刚亮，我们就离开了他那里，给我们留下终身难忘的印象。
    这天晚上，阜阳县委书记乔景清同志约我们吃饭，有杨虎城部队中还留下的同志，也有李烈飞同志
  （即李力果同志），那时都还是二十岁上下的小伙子，朝气蓬勃。虽然蒋介石正在各地屠杀共产党，各个北伐军部队中都在清党，但是阜阳当时的驻军是杨虎城的部队，由于魏金同志长期在杨军里担任政治部主任，撒下了许多革命种子，所以阜阳仍然是到处看到革命的标语，听到国际歌的歌声，小孩子也都还在唱“打倒列强，打倒列强，除军阀！除军阀”的歌子。我们在饭馆中一间房里，高谈阔论，充满了革命必然胜利的信心，大有“谈笑间樯橹灰飞烟灭”的气慨。
    我们从阜阳回到霍丘，带回来极大的鼓舞，两个月的时间，从十个人左右发展到全县各大集镇，都有了党团组织。就在这年的4月8日“阜阳暴动”暴发了，在阜阳刘集一带打起皖北苏维埃第一面红旗，有几万人参加了“分粮，吃大户”的斗争，在皖北燃起了一片烈火。不幸的是时间不久，就听到阜阳暴动失败的消息，就听到魏金同志、乔景清同志等牺牲的消息。我们正在万分焦急的时候，李烈飞同志来到了霍丘。我至今还记得很清楚，他化装穿了一件破大褂，军服裤外面套了一条旧裤子，里面军服裤的裤裆里打了两个子弹洞，他是在敌军包围下从枪林弹雨中突围出来的。
    烈飞同志就在霍丘住下了。他参加了团县委的工作，担任组织委员，住在县城里一个庙的跨院里。这里是县委机关，还住着一位河南人，是“交通”。我由家里偷来了小炉子和米、面，他就在一个菜盒子里作饭。我常常看到他把小面团放在手心里作“猫耳朵”吃。生活是艰苦的，但他的革命乐观主义的精神，永远的昂扬着。
    蒋介石的屠杀，阜阳暴动的许多领导者的牺牲，激起了我们无限愤怒，加之左倾路线的领导，我们霍丘县委决定全县发动示威。约在这年6月间，在一夜之间，全县各大集镇同时散发传单。烈飞同志和我担任城里的散发工作。他正在深夜张贴传单的时候，被敌人警备司令部的一个军官抓住了。他在千钧一发的时候，机警的逃脱了敌人的逮捕，第二天混出城外，由那里我们交代了工作，几个太“红”的同志就流亡到上海，找党的关系，穷得一塌糊涂。后来他居然通过一个同乡关系，搞到了二十元路费，还逛了一次西湖，他就回到陕北，又转入北京，后来在北京担任了党的市委工作。之后，辗转听到他被捕了，我们就断了消息。
    1947年我到了解放区，到处打听他，后来才知道他还活着，改名李力果。
    1949年进北京以后，还在打听他的消息，有一天忽然从医院里得知他正在养病，就住在我的附近，这时他已经害了几乎绝望的肝硬化症，但当我们一别二十多年，又重新会见的时候，他那种高度的革命乐观主义精神，仍然不减当年；对于严重的病情，他没有丝毫的愁眉苦脸，他多么希望身体好起来，为党为人民多作工作。当他病况略有好转的时候，他就积极的向党要求工作，到了机械工业部以后，最初遵守医生的限制，就工作半天，但是慢慢地也就打破了这种限制，有时中午很晚才回家，有时晚上还在开会。每次见到他，他总是笑嘻嘻地认为又能为党工作而衷心的喜悦。
    力果同志的革命的乐观主义精神，永远鼓舞我们前进！
