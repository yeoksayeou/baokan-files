    Great Debate Guarantees Quality
    Tianjin No. 2 Iron Foundry Adopts Effective Measures to Improve Product Qualification Rate Based on Workers' Suggestions
    Taiyuan Vehicle Repair Plant Improves Management System, Freight Car Parts Repair Rate Drops Rapidly
    (Reported by this newspaper) Tianjin No. 2 Iron Foundry mobilized the masses to launch a special debate focusing on the issue of improving casting quality, meticulously analyzed the causes affecting quality, and adopted effective measures. From May 11 to 18, the factory's casting qualification rate increased from about 60% in the past to about 94%.
    The factory decided in early May to focus on improving casting quality as the center of the red flag emulation campaign for increasing production and practicing economy. At that time, some people overemphasized that the poor quality of castings was due to high technical requirements and poor raw materials, and that there was no way to solve it. In order to find out the various reasons affecting quality and unify thinking, the factory decided to mobilize the masses to launch a special debate focusing on improving product quality. At the same time, the defective products produced in the past were put on display, and workers were mobilized to analyze the causes of scrapping item by item, part by part, and process by process in combination with these physical objects. In two days, the staff and workers put forward more than 200 opinions and suggestions. Through analysis, everyone began to realize that the reasons for the low quality of castings were complex, and poor raw materials were only one aspect; the main reason was that the operating regulations and management system were not sound enough. Veteran worker Wang Xiuwen said: "The raw materials used in our factory in the first quarter were not good either, why was the casting qualification rate able to reach more than 90% at that time, but not now? It can be seen that it is not only a raw material problem, but more importantly, there are problems with our operations." Many workers also cited examples to show that the poor operation technology caused many castings to be of poor quality.
    After the special debate clarified the key to causing defective castings, the staff and workers actively tried to strengthen the management of raw materials and sand, and improve technical operations. Some workers in the modeling group used to blame the blast furnace and casting process for the defective products. This time, after finding out the shortcomings in their operations that affected quality, such as the sand box being not tight and the position of the riser for pouring iron water being improper, they were very distressed and immediately took measures to improve. For example, the scrap rate of the large coal washing machine wheel used to be as high as more than 80%. After they researched and improved the inlet for pouring iron water, the qualification rate reached more than 95%. Some workers in the blast furnace group did not care about quality in the past. Through this debate, they also checked the shortcomings in operation such as inconsistent batching ratios, determined special personnel to be responsible for loading, stipulated batching ratios, and improved operations, basically eliminating the phenomenon of casting cracks caused by low iron water temperature.
    In the special debate, the factory also adopted the "debate consultation" method combining leading cadres, veteran workers, and technicians to solve some major quality keys raised by the workers. For example, the large coal washing machine wheel made by the first modeling group had shrinkage porosity, which the group could not solve. After "debate consultation," it was suggested to increase and raise the riser for pouring iron water. The test results showed that the casting qualification rate reached 100%. The leadership promptly promoted this experience, enabling workers producing similar products to also improve the quality of castings. Through the "three-way combination" special debate, the factory also revised the operating regulations and established a quality responsibility system with responsibility at all levels.
    (Dispatch from Taiyuan, May 21) Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant mobilized staff and workers to debate and expose problems existing in production management. At the same time, it established and improved many management systems in production, ensuring that the quality of several key products was rapidly improved and costs were significantly reduced.
    In early May, the factory launched a mass debate focusing on the chaotic phenomena in the factory's production command, responsibility system, technical management system, and economic accounting. In a few days, the entire factory put forward more than 6,800 opinions. At the same time, discussions were also held on the problems of low quality and high cost of certain products; during the discussions, the staff and workers also put forward many rationalization proposals. In response to the problems exposed by the masses, the factory party committee first convened a meeting of party member representatives for discussion, further analyzed the reasons for the above-mentioned problems, and decided to vigorously strengthen management work in accordance with the suggestions of the masses. The production responsibility system, technical responsibility system, and economic accounting system were established and improved respectively. Subsequently, the cadres in charge of the Party Committee went deep into the workshops to further mobilize the masses, and once again launched a large-scale debate with big-character posters focusing on the main problems in current production. Combining from top to bottom, new production management systems were formulated, including work-hour quotas, material quotas, original records, quality inspection and analysis, attendance, material requisition, economic accounting, production command, and centralized scheduling, as well as a system for evaluating the completion of state plans and a reward system on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis. Since the formulation of various systems was based on the mass line, the vast majority of staff and workers could consciously implement them. For example, in order to further implement the technical responsibility system and ensure product quality, the staff and workers of the mechanical workshop specifically established a "four-check" system of self-inspection, group leader inspection, foreman inspection, and inspector inspection, closely combining self-inspection with inspector inspection, thereby rapidly reducing the repair rate of freight car parts from 40% to 5%. The staff and workers in each workshop also conscientiously implemented the attendance system, and adopted the method of establishing nameplate attendance boxes for large workshops by shift and for small workshops by workshop, closely combining workshop attendance with group attendance, so that the attendance rate and work-hour utilization rate were improved.
    Because the work of mobilizing the masses was done deeply and meticulously, the masses exposed the problems thoroughly, and the systems formulated were practical and specific, the achievements in comprehensively completing production tasks and improving product quality were very significant. For example, when making castings in the foundry workshop, the automatic cylinder yield rate increased from 98% to 100% and the axle box yield rate also increased from 96% to 100% due to strengthened intermediate inspection, the adoption of flow-line operation, and the implementation of dedicated personnel in charge and process specialization. After the locomotive workshop established the quality responsibility system, it used the method of "one pole to the end," where one person was responsible for a part or component from the first process to the last process. As a result, the number of repaired locomotive parts and components quickly dropped from an average of more than 70 pieces per unit to 35 pieces. In addition, while product quality was improved, the vast majority of staff and workers actively improved work-hour utilization rate and worked hard to save raw materials. As a result, the cost of major products was also reduced. After strengthening the economic accounting system, the utilization rate of molten iron increased by nearly 20%. With the implementation of the small ticket material requisition system, everyone requisitioned as much as they used, and actively tried to save new and good materials, and utilize old materials and edge and small materials. In April, auxiliary materials alone saved 175 kilograms of heavy oil and 600 kilograms of water glass. The raw materials saved by the staff and workers of the locomotive workshop in April were worth more than 6,400 yuan. (Attached image)

    大鸣大放保证质量
    天津第二铸铁厂根据工人建议采取有效措施提高正品率
    太原车辆修理厂健全管理制度货车配件返修率迅速下降
    本报讯　天津第二铸铁厂发动群众围绕提高铸件质量问题展开专题鸣放，细致地分析出影响质量的原因，采取了有效措施。5月11日至18日，全厂铸件正品率已由过去60％提高到94％左右。
    这个厂是在5月初确定以提高铸件质量为增产节约红旗竞赛运动的中心的。当时有一部分人过分强调铸件质量不好是因为技术要求高，原料不好，没法解决。为了找出影响质量的各种原因，统一思想，这个厂决定发动群众围绕提高产品质量展开专题鸣放。同时把过去生产的废品拿出来展览，发动工人结合这些实物按产品、按部件、按工序逐项分析报废的原因。职工们在两天内就提出了两百多件意见和建议，通过分析，大家开始认识到造成铸件质量不高的原因很复杂，原料不好仅是一个方面；主要的原因却是操作规程和管理制度不够健全。老工人王秀文说：“咱厂第一季度用的原材料也不好，为什么那时候铸件正品率能够达到90％以上，现在就不行了呢？可见，不光是原料问题，更重要的是咱们操作有问题。”许多工人们还举例说明，因为操作技术不好，造成很多铸件的质量低劣。
    通过专题鸣放明确了造成铸件残次品的关键以后，职工们就积极设法加强原料和砂的管理，改进技术操作。造型组有些工人过去出了残次品，就把责任推给大炉和浇铸工序，这次找出了自己操作中存在的合砂箱不严、浇铁水冒口位置不当等影响质量的缺点后，都十分痛心，马上采取措施改进。像洗煤机大轮过去废品率高达80％以上，经过他们研究改进了浇铁水的水口以后，正品率达到95％以上。大炉组有些工人过去不关心质量，通过这次鸣放，他们也检查了操作上配料比例不一致等缺点，确定了专人负责上料，规定了配料比例，并改进了操作，基本上消灭了因为铁水温度低而造成的铸件裂纹现象。
    在专题鸣放中，这个厂还根据工人们提出的一些重大的质量关键，采取了领导干部、老工人、技术人员三结合的“鸣放会诊”办法来解决。如造型一组做的洗煤机大轮出了缩孔，小组里解决不了，经过“鸣放会诊”，提出了加大加高浇铁水冒口的建议，试验结果铸件正品率达到百分之百。领导上及时推广了这个经验，使生产同类产品的工人也提高了铸件质量。通过“三结合”专题鸣放，这个厂还修订了操作规程，建立层层负责的质量责任制。
    本报太原21日电　太原机车车辆修理厂发动职工鸣放辩论，揭发了生产管理上存在的问题，同时建立与健全了生产中的许多管理制度，保证了几种重点产品的质量迅速提高，成本显著降低。
    这个厂于5月初针对本厂生产指挥、责任制、技术管理制度、经济核算等混乱现象，发动群众进行鸣放。几天的时间，全厂提出了六千八百多条意见。同时，还对某些产品质量低、成本高的问题进行了讨论；讨论当中，职工们还提出了许多合理化建议。针对群众所揭发出来的问题，工厂党委首先召开了党员代表大会，进行了讨论，进一步分析了产生上述问题的原因，决定按照群众的建议大力加强管理工作。分别把生产责任制、技术责任制和经济核算制建立与健全起来。随后，党委负责干部便分工深入车间，进一步深入发动群众，针对当前生产中的主要问题，再次展开大鸣大放大字报大辩论，上下结合，订出了新的工时定额、材料定额、原始纪录、质量检查分析、考勤、材料领发、经济核算、生产指挥、集中调度等项生产管理制度，以及逐级按月、按旬、按日评比完成国家计划情况的制度和奖励制度。由于各种制度的订立是建立在群众路线的基础上的，因此广大职工都能自觉地执行。如机械车间的职工，为了进一步贯彻技术责任制，保证产品质量，又具体建立了自己检查、组长检查、工长检查、检查员检查的“四检”制度，把自我检查和检查员检查紧密结合起来，从而使货车配件的返修率由40％迅速降低到5％。各车间职工也都认真进行了考勤制度，并采取大车间以班为单位，小车间以车间为单位建立名牌箱考勤制度的办法，把车间考勤和小组考勤紧密结合起来，因而出勤率和工时利用率都有了提高。
    由于发动群众的工作做得深入细致，群众对问题揭发得深透，订的制度切实具体，在全面完成生产任务、产品质量的提高，成绩非常显著。如翻砂车间在做铸件时，由于加强了中间检查，采取了流水作业法，实行了专人负责和工序专业化，使自动筒的成品率由98％提高到100％，轴箱成品率也由96％提高到100％。机车车间建立了质量责任制以后，用一竿子插到底的办法，一个零件或一个部件从首道工序到末一道工序，都由一个人负责到底，结果机车的返修零、部件很快就由平均每台七十多件降低到三十五件。此外，在产品质量提高的同时，广大职工积极提高工时利用率，努力节约原材料，因而主要产品的成本也随之降低。加强经济核算制度以后，铁水的利用率就提高了将近20％。随着小票领料制的贯彻，大家用多少就领多少，并积极设法节省新料、好料，利用旧料和边、小料，4月份仅辅助材料就节约了重油一百七十五公斤，水玻璃六百公斤，机车车间职工在4月份节约的原材料，价值六千四百多元。（附图片）
