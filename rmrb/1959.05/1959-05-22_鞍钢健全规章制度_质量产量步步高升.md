Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 21st - The Anshan Iron and Steel (Anshan) workers, on the basis of significant achievements in the first half of May, continue their efforts to strive for high-quality, high-yield steel, and have achieved complete success for five consecutive days since the 16th. In the five days from the 16th to the 20th, the daily average actual output, compared with the daily output plan, exceeded by 514 tons for pig iron, 1,196 tons for steel, and 55 tons for steel products. The quality of steel has also improved significantly. In the five days, the qualification rate of pig iron jumped from 97.22% to 98.72%; the average qualification rate of steel products in the middle ten days of the month increased by 2.11% compared with the plan.

After summarizing the experience of increasing production and practicing economy in the first half of May, the workers of Anshan's factories and mines immediately plunged into a new upsurge of competition that demanded both high output and high quality. In order to improve product quality, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently held successive professional meetings of factory and mine directors and quality control personnel to study quality problems such as steel ingot casting, steel billet heating, and rolling. The factories and mines also vigorously educated workers on the importance of product quality, and extensively mobilized the masses to establish and improve regulations and systems to ensure improved quality. The First Steel Plant held quality meetings in each shift, with furnace chiefs, assistants, and smelting technicians participating, to discuss and formulate many measures to ensure good steel production and eliminate low-temperature steel, and other measures to ensure quality. Some steel rolling mills have also revised the steel billet heating and treatment system, and improved systems such as sending steel by furnace, rolling steel by furnace number, and preventing substandard and waste products from leaving the factory. The Ironmaking Plant transferred fourteen workers and technicians to serve as quality inspectors, further strengthening the supervision and inspection of charging, the operating process, and the quality of molten iron. Workers in mines, sintering plants, chemical plants, and other factories and mines also vigorously supported the Ironmaking Plant with high-quality sintered ore and coke.

In summarizing the previous stage of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, workers in various factories and mines generally recognized that strengthening equipment maintenance and rapidly increasing equipment utilization rates are the key to the current campaign to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, they vigorously took measures to strengthen equipment maintenance, reduce accidents, and increase equipment utilization rates. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee recently convened a meeting of the company's steelmaking experts to promote the experience of the No. 6 open-hearth furnace in maintaining the furnace body and improving the operating rate. After learning this experience, the steelmaking experts in each factory seriously studied this experience. The Second Steel Plant mobilized the masses to concentrate their efforts on breaking through the key of welding the furnace nozzle, so that the furnace maintenance situation gradually improved, and accidents were greatly reduced. Because the furnace repair time was shortened, the equipment utilization rate increased from an average of 86.36% in the first half of the month to 87.8%, and daily output exceeded the plan by 371 tons of steel.

    鞍钢健全规章制度  质量产量步步高升
    新华社鞍山21日电　鞍钢职工在5月上半月取得显著成绩的基础上，再接再厉，力争钢铁优质高产，从16日起，连续五天全面告捷。在16日到20日的五天中，每天的平均实际产量同日产量计划比较，生铁多产五百一十四吨，钢多产一千一百九十六吨，钢材多产五十五吨。钢铁的质量也有显著提高，五天中生铁的合格率又由97.22％跃到98.72％；钢材的合格率中旬平均比计划提高了2.11％。
    鞍钢各厂矿职工在总结了五月上半月增产节约的经验以后，接着就投入了既要高产量又要高质量的新的竞赛热潮。为了提高产品质量，鞍钢公司最近连续召开了厂矿长和负责质量检查人员的专业会议，逐项研究钢锭浇注，钢坯加烧和轧制等质量问题。各厂矿并且大力向职工进行重视产品质量的教育，广泛发动群众建立和健全保证提高质量的规章制度。第一炼钢厂各班分别召开了有炉长、助手和冶炼技师参加的质量会议，讨论和制订了许多项保证出好钢、消灭低温钢等保证质量的措施。有些轧钢厂也修订了钢坯加热、钢坯处理制度，和健全了按炉送钢、按炉号轧钢、次品废品不出厂等制度。炼铁厂抽调了十四名工人和技术人员担当质量检查员，进一步加强了投料、操作过程和铁水质量的监督、检查；矿山、烧结、化工等厂矿职工也以高质量的烧结矿和焦炭，大力支援炼铁厂。
    各厂矿职工在总结前一阶段增产节约运动时，普遍认识到加强维护设备、迅速提高设备作业率是当前增产节约运动的关键，因此大力采取措施加强维护设备，减少事故，提高设备作业率。鞍钢党委最近召集全公司的炼钢能手开会，推广了六号平炉维护炉体、提高作业率的经验后，各厂炼钢能手们都认真学习了这一经验。第二炼钢厂发动群众，集中力量突破炉子喷出口焊住的关键，使炉子维护情况逐步好转，事故大大减少；因为缩短了修炉时间，设备作业率已由上半月平均86.36％增加到87.8％，每天比计划超产三百七十一吨钢。
