　　Working Together to Accelerate Socialist Construction
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie
Since the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party issued a call to the people of the whole country on March 6 this year to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, for more than two months, workers all over the country have actively responded to the Party's call and have put forward various specific initiatives and guarantees. A labor emulation drive to greatly accelerate socialist construction has been widely launched throughout the country.
Recently, this reporter visited the Budapest Machine Tool and Metal Equipment Factory. All the employees of this factory are brainstorming and working hard together to strive for the successful completion of the new tasks they have proposed.

　　Proposed New Production Targets
This factory achieved great victories in production last year. Although the number of employees decreased from 2,300 to 1,300, the total output value increased by one times compared with 1950, and increased by nearly 8.5 million forints (Hungarian currency) compared with 1957, and saved 4 million forints for the country. The new product "EU-500" universal machine tool has reached the world level. Thanks to the efforts of all the employees, it honorably won the mobile red flag of the Council of Ministers and the Central Council of Trade Unions. Based on the achievements already made, the factory formulated a new production plan at the beginning of this year, deciding to achieve a total output value of 98.4 million forints, which is 14.5% higher than in 1958, labor productivity increased by 4.5%, and production costs decreased by 6%.
The new task of accelerating socialist construction proposed by the Party Central Committee on March 6 was warmly welcomed by the workers of the Budapest Machine Tool and Metal Equipment Factory. The factory's activists' meeting immediately revised and improved the factory's original production plan, and unanimously decided to achieve various indicators expected to be reached in 1960 this year.
Everyone decided to produce eleven more large precision machine tools and various machine parts worth more than 2 million forints this year without increasing machinery and equipment and the number of workers. In this way, the total output value will increase by about 12 million forints compared with the original plan, and labor productivity will increase by another 2% compared with the original plan. The production level expected in 1960 can be achieved this year. In order to reduce production costs, specific measures have been formulated to improve technology and practice economy, and all employees of the factory have undertaken the task of saving nearly 4 million forints this year.
In terms of machine manufacturing, the utilization rate of raw materials should be increased by 5%, the amount of non-ferrous metals used should be reduced by 40%, and efforts should be made to reduce the weight of each "MVE" machine tool by 200 kilograms.
To ensure that the export volume of machine tools is increased by another 10%, thirty more "MVE" machine tools will be provided for export.
"The task is very arduous, but the workers of our Machine Tool and Metal Equipment Factory will do what they say, and will definitely complete or exceed the new targets we have proposed," the old machine tool worker Hvalkasi Bela told the reporter with full confidence.

　　Labor Emulation is in Full Swing
In order to realize their bold words, all the employees of the factory have worked together and launched a labor emulation drive. In the past month, they have been striving to be the first to over fulfill the prescribed production tasks, and the factory's scrap rate has dropped rapidly from 1.88% in the previous month to 0.4%.
In the new labor emulation, the employees fully promoted the spirit of cooperation and collectivism.
Gyulasić János, a member of the Socialist Workers' Party and a machine tool worker, not only overfulfilled his production task by 25% in one month, but also helped a young worker who was not skilled enough to complete 100% of the prescribed production indicators. In the previous month, this young worker could only complete 90% of the production task. Gyulasić János, who was working skillfully beside the machine, told the reporter: "Only by helping each other and working together can we guarantee the successful completion of the factory's plan. Relying on the strength of a few people cannot create miracles."
Machine tool worker József is the factory's best production expert, and he always takes the lead in completing production tasks. However, his workshop is the most backward in the factory. Recently, József, together with his comrades in the workshop, conducted research and found out that the main reason for the backwardness of their workshop was that the scrap rate was too high; and the reason for the high scrap rate was that the work methods of several workers were incorrect, and the products produced were often not up to standard. For the past month, József has concentrated his efforts on helping these workers improve their work methods, completely changing the previous phenomenon of high scrap rates. In this way, this workshop has become the best workshop in the factory.
The collective and individual competition conditions stipulated in each workshop include not only the completion of the production plan, product quality, and ensuring machine cleanliness, but also comparing the spirit and achievements of mutual assistance and cooperation.
In this competition, the tendency of formalism was overcome. Various units and workers formulated practical and feasible goals based on their own actual conditions and fully explored various potentials.
The members of the Socialist Workers' Party played an exemplary and leading role in the competition. Geleges György, the secretary of the Party branch of the machine tool workshop, told reporters that there are nine party members in their workshop, all of whom are excellent workers in the workshop. They play an exemplary role in completing production targets, observing labor discipline, and promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. He himself was also named a winner in the labor emulation.
In the finished product inspection workshop, the reporter visited the inspector and old worker Nováki József. He said that recently not only has the quantity of products increased, but also the quality has improved significantly.

　　Pooling Wisdom and Efforts to Improve Technology
Since liberation, the development of production and the growth of technical cadres in this factory have eloquently proved the creative genius and enthusiasm for socialist construction of the working class.
This factory was established in 1892. In the half century before liberation, it changed many owners, but neither feudal earls, capitalists, wealthy merchants, nor fascist warlords were able to develop this factory. Before nationalization in 1948, the factory could only produce about 100 very backward and outdated machine tools each year.
However, in the past ten years or so, the face of the factory has completely changed. In the first few years after nationalization, it was able to produce about 400 various new-style machine tools with improved technology and quality each year.
Last year, the factory produced a total of eleven new types of machines and manufactured various machine parts. The new large-scale machine tools alone produced more than 800 units. The "EU-500" universal machine tool created by all the employees of the factory has reached the world level and was praised by the audience at the Brussels Industrial Exhibition.
Due to continuous technological improvements, the factory's products are now very popular in the world market. Therefore, more than 60% of the products here are exported, and our country also imports machine tools manufactured by this factory.
Now the production process of this factory has been semi-automated. For example, the production of each "MVE-280" machine tool took 2,300 hours in 1954, while now it only takes 860 hours to complete.
At present, all the employees of the factory are trial-producing many new-style machine tools to further realize production automation, improve product quality, and reduce production costs. They are full of confidence that they will surpass the level of Western countries in the technical level of many products.
The reason why this factory has been able to continuously improve in production technology is due to the hard work and efforts of all employees. Chief Engineer Metka Ferenc said that workers put forward hundreds of rationalization proposals every year, which have a very important meaning and role in improving production and improving technology.
All the technical personnel and leading cadres of the factory also attach great importance to technological improvement and improvement. At present, more than 80% of the leaders and technical cadres of this factory, such as the factory director, chief engineer, and party committee secretary, are workers. Their ability to quickly improve in technology and successfully lead the production of such a modern factory also fully demonstrates the creative genius and hard-working spirit of the working class. For example, Chief Engineer Metka Ferenc was an ordinary machine tool worker before 1949. After liberation, due to the improvement of working conditions and the encouragement of the Party, he studied while working, and graduated from the technical school and the night school of the Budapest University of Technology. In 1956, he became a mechanical engineer, and in 1957, he became the chief engineer. The rapid improvement of this factory in technology in recent years is also inseparable from Comrade Metka's hard work and hard work.
　　Ambitious, Courageous, and Forge Ahead
The workers of the Budapest Machine Tool and Metal Equipment Factory have a long revolutionary tradition and a glorious history of struggle. In 1918, the workers of this factory took up arms to participate in the 1918 revolution. After the establishment of the Soviet Republic in 1919, the workers became the masters of the factory and carried out a series of revolutionary measures. The workers' political and production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. Some people went to the front line to actively participate in the struggle to defend the Soviet Republic, and some people persisted in production in the factory. Under the war environment of greatly reduced number of workers and difficult supply in all aspects, it was guaranteed that production increased by 10%, which was better than any production achievements under the rule of the bourgeoisie. In the years of Horthy's fascist white terror, the workers never gave up their heroic struggle to achieve communism.
Since the Soviet army defeated Hitler and Horthy's fascists and liberated Hungary, all the employees of the factory have actively promoted their creative genius, improved production year by year, and improved their material and cultural life. Therefore, during the counter-revolutionary rebellion in 1956, the workers of this factory firmly crushed the enemy's sabotage conspiracy and defended their factory.
For more than two years, under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party, this factory has not only achieved brilliant results in production, but also its political and cultural life has been unprecedentedly active.
Denis Albert, the secretary of the factory's party committee, said that although the number of party members in the factory is now less than before the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Party's influence and role has been greatly strengthened than before. Party members not only take the lead in leading the masses to ensure the completion of production tasks, but also often conduct political and theoretical studies to continuously improve their political level. The Communist Youth League and the trade union have also become powerful assistants to the Party in uniting, educating, and organizing the broad masses to complete production tasks.
Now 53% of the workers in the factory often read books. According to statistics for the past six months, the factory's own library has lent out 10,000 books, of which more than 7,000 are political and literary books, and the rest are science and technology books.
One hundred and fifty workers are currently working while persisting in studying at school, of which sixteen are studying at the night school of the Capital University of Technology.
Comrade Denis Albert, the secretary of the factory's party committee, was an excellent worker in the machine tool workshop more than two years ago. After the counter-revolutionary incident in 1956, he was elected as the secretary of the party committee. Now, in addition to working, he insists on going to the night school of the University of Technology to further improve his scientific and technological knowledge; he is also actively engaged in literary creation. He has written a film script reflecting the heroic struggle of the working class, and is now completing the novels "Years of Apprenticeship" and "Dad".
The club in the factory often holds various cultural and recreational activities. The performances of the band organized by the workers themselves are also very popular among the audience. The factory and two other factories jointly built a sports field. After work, the football teams, basketball teams, and volleyball teams of various workshops often come here to compete.
The factory also has its own well-equipped nursery and sanatorium.
However, the workers of the Budapest Machine Tool and Metal Equipment Factory are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. They are advancing on the road of socialism with more firm and rapid steps. After the completion of the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the factory will be further developed in all aspects during the new Five-Year Plan.

    同心合力加速社会主义建设
    本报记者　王崇杰
    自从今年3月6日匈牙利社会主义工人党向全国人民发出提前一年完成三年计划主要指标的号召后，两个多月以来，全国各地的职工们都积极响应党的号召，纷纷提出各种具体倡议和保证，大力加速社会主义建设的劳动竞赛热潮，已在全国普遍展开。
    最近记者访问了布达佩斯机床和金属器材厂。这个厂的全体职工正在开动脑筋，发挥干劲，同心合力为胜利完成他们提出的新任务而奋斗。
      提出新的生产指标
    这个工厂去年在生产方面取得了很大的胜利，虽然职工人数由以前的二千三百人减少到一千三百人，但在总产值方面比1950年提高了一倍，比1957年增加了将近八百五十万福林（匈币），并且为国家节约了四百万福林。新的产品“EU—500”型万能机床已达到了世界水平。由于全厂职工的努力，光荣地获得了部长会议和工会中央理事会的流动红旗。在已取得的成就的基础上，今年年初工厂制定了新的生产计划，在总产值方面决定要达到九千八百四十万福林，这比1958年提高了14.5％，劳动生产率提高4.5％，生产成本降低6％。
    3月6日党中央提出的加速社会主义建设的新任务，受到布达佩斯机床和金属器材厂职工们热烈的欢迎，全厂的积极分子大会立即修改和提高了工厂原订的生产计划，一致决定今年就实现预计在1960年达到的各种指标。
    大家决定在不增加机器设备和工人人数的条件下，今年要超过原计划多生产十一台大型精密机床和价值两百多万福林的各种机器零件，这样总产值将比原计划增加一千二百万福林左右，劳动生产率比原计划再提高2％。今年便可达到预计1960年的生产水平。为了降低生产成本，制定了改进技术和厉行节约的具体措施，全厂职工承担了今年节约近四百万福林的任务。
    在机器制造方面，原料的使用率要提高5％，有色金属的使用量要减少40％，并要设法使每台“MVE”型机床的重量减少二百公斤。
    要保证使机床的出口额再增加10％，为此将多提供三十台“MVE”型机床出口。
    “任务是非常艰巨的，但是我们机床和金属器材厂的职工们说到就能做到，一定会完成或超过我们提出的新指标。”老机床工人赫瓦尔凯西·贝拉满怀信心地这样告诉记者。
      劳动竞赛热火朝天
    为实现自己的豪言壮语，全厂职工同心协力，纷纷展开了劳动竞赛，一个月来他们争先恐后，都超额完成了规定的生产任务，全厂的废品率从前一个月的1.88％，迅速下降为0.4％。
    在新的劳动竞赛中，职工们充分发扬了协作和集体主义精神。
    社会主义工人党党员、机床工人久拉西奇·亚诺什一个月内不仅自己超额完成了25％的生产任务，并且帮助一个还不够熟练的青年工人百分之百地完成了规定的各种生产指标，而前一个月这个青年工人还只能完成90％的生产任务。正在机器旁边熟练地劳动着的久拉西奇·亚诺什告诉记者说：“只有大家互相帮助共同努力，才可能保证全厂计划的胜利完成，只靠几个人的力量是创造不出奇迹的。”
    机床工人尤热夫是全厂最优秀的生产能手，在完成生产任务方面他总是走在最前面。但是他工作的车间在全厂说来却是最落后的。最近尤热夫同车间的同志们一起进行了研究，找出了他们车间的落后的主要原因，是由于废品率太高；而形成废品率高的原因，是因为几个工人的工作方法不正确，制出的产品常常不合标准。尤热夫一个月来集中精力，帮助这些工人改进了工作方法，彻底改变了以前废品率较高的现象，这样，这个车间便一跃而成了全厂最优秀的车间。
    在各车间规定的集体和个人竞赛条件中，不仅包括生产计划完成情况、产品质量和保证机器清洁等项目，而且还要比互助协作精神和成绩。
    在这次竞赛中，克服了形式主义的倾向，各单位和工人都根据自己的实际情况，充分发掘各种潜力，制定了实际可行的目标。
    社会主义工人党的党员在竞赛中都起了模范和带头作用。机床车间的党支部书记盖莱盖什·捷尔吉告诉记者说，他们车间共有九个党员，都是车间优秀的劳动者，不论在完成生产指标、遵守劳动纪律和发扬互助协作精神方面，都起着模范作用，他自己也被评为劳动竞赛的优胜者。
    在成品检查车间记者访问了检查员老工人诺瓦基·约瑟夫。他说，最近不仅产品数量增加了，而且质量方面也有了显著地提高。
    群策群力提高技术
    解放以来，这个工厂生产的发展和技术干部的成长，雄辩地证明了工人阶级的创造天才和建设社会主义的热情。
    这个工厂建立于1892年。在解放前的半个世纪中，它改换了很多主人，但是不论是封建伯爵、资本家、富商还是法西斯军阀，都没有能使这个厂得到什么发展。1948年国有化以前，这个工厂每年只能出产一百台左右的非常落后和陈旧的机床。
    但是，最近十年多来，工厂的面貌完全改变了。国有化后的最初几年，每年就能出产四百台左右在技术和质量方面都经过改进的各种新式机床。
    去年全厂共生产十一种新式的机器，并制造各种机器零件，仅新式的大型机床就出产了八百多台。全厂职工们创造的“EU—500”型万能机床已达到了世界水平，在布鲁塞尔工业展览会上得到观众的好评。
    由于技术的不断改进，这个工厂的产品现在在世界市场上很受欢迎，所以这里60％以上的产品都是出口的，我国也输入这个工厂制造的机床。
    现在这个工厂的生产过程都实行了半自动化。例如，每台“MVE—280”型机床的生产，在1954年还需要花两千三百小时，而现在只要八百六十小时就可以完成了。
    目前全厂的职工正在试制很多新式的机床，进一步实现生产自动化，提高产品质量和降低生产成本。他们满怀信心地要在很多产品的技术水平方面超过西方国家的水平。
    这个工厂所以能在生产技术方面不断获得改进，是由于全体职工刻苦钻研、群策群力的结果。总工程师梅特卡·费伦茨说，每年工人们都提出几百条合理化建议，这在提高生产和改进技术方面有着非常重大的意义和作用。
    全厂的技术人员和领导干部也都非常重视技术的改进和提高。现在这个工厂的厂长、总工程师、党委书记等，80％以上的领导和技术干部，都是工人出身的。他们能在技术方面迅速得到提高和胜利地领导这样一个现代化工厂的生产，也充分说明了工人阶级的创造天才和刻苦学习的精神。例如总工程师梅特卡·费伦茨在1949年前还是一个普通的机床工人，在解放后，由于劳动条件的改善和党的鼓励，他一方面劳动一方面学习，先后在技术学校和布达佩斯工业大学夜校毕了业，1956年便开始成为机械工程师，1957年后又担任总工程师的职务。这个工厂最近几年能在技术方面很快提高，也是与梅特卡同志的努力钻研和刻苦工作分不开的。
  志高胆大，勇往直前
    布达佩斯机床和金属器材厂的工人们有着悠久的革命传统和光荣的斗争历史。1918年这个工厂的工人就拿起武器参加了1918年的革命，1919年苏维埃共和国成立后，工人成了工厂的主人，进行了一系列革命的措施，工人们的政治和生产热情空前高涨，一部分人走上前线积极参加了保卫苏维埃共和国的斗争，一部分人在工厂内坚持了生产，在工人人数大大减少和各方面供应很困难的战争环境下，保证生产提高了10％，这比资产阶级统治的任何年代的生产成绩都好。在霍尔蒂法西斯白色恐怖的年代里，工人也从未放弃为争取实现共产主义的英勇斗争。
    自从苏军战胜希特勒和霍尔蒂法西斯解放了匈牙利以后，全厂的职工积极地发扬了创造天才，逐年提高了生产，改善了物质和文化生活，所以当1956年反革命叛乱期间，这个工厂的工人们坚定地粉碎了敌人的破坏阴谋，保卫了自己的工厂。
    两年多来，在社会主义工人党的领导下，这个工厂不仅在生产方面取得了辉煌的成绩，政治和文化生活也空前地活跃起来。
    工厂的党委书记杰尼斯·阿尔拜尔特说，现在厂内的党员人数虽然比反革命叛乱事件以前减少了，但是党的影响党的作用却比以前大大加强了。党员不仅以身作则的带动群众保证完成生产任务，并且经常进行政治理论学习，不断提高政治水平。共青团和工会也在团结教育和组织广大群众完成生产任务方面成了党有力的助手。
    现在全厂有53％的工人经常读书。据过去半年的统计，仅这个工厂自己的图书馆就出借了一万册书，其中政治和文艺书籍有七千多册，其余的是科学和技术方面的书籍。
    有一百五十个工人目前一方面劳动，一方面坚持到学校学习，其中有十六人在首都工业大学的夜校学习。
    这个工厂的党委书记杰尼斯·阿尔拜尔特同志，在两年多以前是机床车间的优秀工人，1956年反革命事件后被选为党委书记。现在他在作工之余，一方面坚持进工业大学夜校，进一步提高科学技术知识；一面还积极从事文学创作，他已写成了反映工人阶级英勇斗争的电影脚本，现在正在完成小说“徒工的年代”和“爸爸”。
    厂内的俱乐部经常举办各种文娱活动。工人们自己组织的乐队的演出，也很受观众欢迎。这个工厂并且同另外两个工厂联合修建了体育场，下班后各车间的足球队、篮球队和排球队等，常到这里来进行比赛。
    工厂并有自己的设备完善的托儿所和休养所。
    但是布达佩斯机床和金属器材厂的职工们并不满足于已取得的成就，他们正在以更坚定和更迅速的步伐，在社会主义的大路上挺进。三年计划提前完成后，在新的五年计划期间，这个工厂在各方面将得到更大的发展。
