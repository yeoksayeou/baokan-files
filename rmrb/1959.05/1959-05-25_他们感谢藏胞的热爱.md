They Thank Tibetan Compatriots for Their Love

By Our Correspondents Cheng Yi, Gu Fan, and Jiang Qingzhao

“The victory of our army in quelling the rebellion in Tibet is inseparable from the support of the broad masses of Tibetan people. The logistical work could guarantee the sufficient supply of the rebellious troops, and we must also thank the Tibetan compatriots for their love and support.” This is what Captain Che Junxian, a representative of the logistics unit of the Tibet Military Region, said with gratitude and praise at the Second Congress of Advanced Units and Activists in Logistics Work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He and many logistics soldiers from the anti-rebellion forces reported on their personal experiences of being deeply loved and warmly supported by the Tibetan people.

On the Tibetan Plateau, snow-capped mountains, grasslands, glaciers, and canyons often bring many difficulties to the advance of the anti-rebellion troops. However, no matter day or night, whenever the troops went, Tibetan compatriots would automatically come to build bridges, repair roads, act as guides, or organize yak teams to support the army's transportation. Once, the troops where military doctor Wang Qiuping was serving entered a snow-capped mountain to pursue the rebels. The road was unfamiliar and difficult to continue. At this time, an old Tibetan herdsman in his seventies, Duo Langcuoji, came to lead the troops. He told the soldiers that many young people in their pasture had been kidnapped by the rebels, women had been brutally raped, and yaks and food had been looted. The herdsmen's only hope was: "Kinzhuma (the People's Liberation Army) will come to avenge us! Kill all these harmful demons!" Old man Duo Langcuoji, with angry eyes, strode forward, leading the troops for a whole day and night, climbing over three snow-capped mountains, crossing many forests, canyons, and swamps, and finally enabled the anti-rebellion army to quickly catch up with the remnants of the rebels and wipe them out in one fell swoop. After the victory of the battle, the soldiers asked old man Duo Langcuoji with concern if he was tired. He carried the spoils of victory, beaming with joy, and said: "Not tired, not tired! Don't look at my old age, I also want to live a good life after the demons are eliminated!"

Shang Qingyi, the deputy political instructor of the automobile transportation unit, told how their motorcade was supported by Tibetan compatriots in completing the arduous and difficult transportation tasks. He said: "Without the support of Tibetan compatriots, our motorcade would be unable to move an inch."

In the snow-capped mountains and grasslands, the automobile transportation team often encountered not only dangerous roads and harsh climates, but also many highways and bridges were destroyed by the rebels, making it impossible for vehicles to pass. However, every difficulty was overcome with the active support of the local Tibetan compatriots. Once, just as the motorcade led by Shang Qingyi was climbing a snow-capped mountain slope called Walongqiwa, it suddenly started raining and hailing. It looked like a section of the steep slope ahead would be washed away, and the motorcade could not continue. The drivers had no choice but to jump out of the car and brave the wind, rain, and hail to repair the road in order to find a way to pass. At this time, suddenly a burst of "Alo!" "Alo!" shouts came from far and near, and then more than 300 Tibetan compatriots wearing old sheepskin coats appeared from the forest. They held hoes and iron shovels and galloped over: "We are local people, we know that the road will be damaged in this kind of weather, so we came here specially. The cars in front of you were all pulled up the mountain by us." After speaking, they took off their old sheepskin coats and long riding boots, and worked barefoot with the soldiers. Some moved stones, some shoveled soil, and some paved the road. A group of young men also set up mud ball counting to compete with the soldiers in a friendly competition. The lively labor lasted for a whole afternoon, and the collapsed road was repaired. Then, the Tibetan compatriots lit torches by the roadside for lighting. They and the soldiers worked together to pull more than 40 large trucks loaded with supplies to the top of the mountain. Early the next morning, when the morning sun climbed the snow peaks, the motorcade was about to set off again. Before leaving, Deputy Instructor Shang Qingyi, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers, presented cigarettes and two bags of fried noodles to the Tibetan compatriots as a gift to thank them for their enthusiastic support. The Tibetan compatriots also wished the motorcade "a safe journey and good luck!"

Under the enthusiastic care and vigorous support of the Tibetan compatriots, the rebels' conspiracy to sabotage transportation and attempt to prevent our army from advancing was repeatedly defeated.

Model driver Liu Qinshi said that wherever he and his comrades went, they could see groups of male and female Tibetan compatriots enthusiastically helping the engineering troops of the People's Liberation Army to repair the highways and bridges destroyed by the rebels. In some places, the Tibetan compatriots had already repaired the highways and bridges before the engineering troops arrived. Under a snow-capped mountain called Guanggaishan, Liu Qinshi and his comrades had just driven to a river when they found that the wooden bridge on the river had been burned by the rebels, and the smoke was billowing. They quickly got out of the car to put out the fire and rescue the bridge. At this time, more than a dozen Tibetan compatriots also ran down from the mountain and immediately joined the soldiers in fighting the fire. However, most of the bridge had been burned down, and the car could not pass. While Liu Qinshi and others were worried, the Tibetan compatriots immediately greeted the people on the mountain and worked with the soldiers to cut trees and transport stones. After a tense afternoon of work, they finally repaired a pontoon bridge. In the evening, Liu Qinshi and his comrades, with excitement, bid farewell to the lovely Tibetan compatriots, crossed the river, crossed the snow-capped mountains, and delivered the urgently needed supplies to the front line that night, ensuring the victory of the anti-rebellion battle.

Captain Che Junxian came from Lhasa. He warmly praised and thanked the people of Lhasa for their courage and friendship in supporting the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. He said that on the afternoon of March 21, when the People's Liberation Army was clearing the remaining rebels in the suburbs of Lhasa, many poor citizens came to help the troops carry stretchers and transport bullets. Some simple and kind old women also fearlessly braved the artillery fire and gunfire to send butter tea and milk residue to the soldiers. An old woman in her fifties also sent tea to the sentry post of Che Junxian's garrison every night, which moved the soldiers to decline repeatedly. However, this respectable old man always said with tears in his eyes: "Kinzhuma! You have worked hard, you are our saviors!" She accused the rebels of the bloody crimes of killing her family, and complained about the slave life she had lived all her life, demanding that the People's Liberation Army help the Tibetan people get out of the sea of suffering and live a free and happy life as soon as possible.

Captain Che Junxian also said that on the fifth day after the rebellion was quelled in Lhasa, the poor citizens of the city spontaneously organized a transportation team of a thousand camels to ask the logistics leadership organs of the military region to give them transportation tasks to support the army's advance to suppress the scattered bandits in Shannan. Many Tibetan youths also asked to be issued weapons to assist the People's Liberation Army in combat. There was a Tibetan youth named Zhaxi, who escaped from the Zedang area of Shannan to Lhasa in 1953. At that time, it was a time of food shortage, and the local serf owner forced his father to pay food and debts. The old man could not bear it any longer and said a few words of resistance. The serf owner immediately used whips, iron chains, and other instruments of torture to beat the old man to death on the spot. Zhaxi's mother died of illness as a result. A hereditary serf family was left with only Zhaxi, a minor child. However, the cruel serf owner still did not give up, and he still wanted to beat Zhaxi to death. At this time, a neighbor secretly told this pitiful orphan: "Run away quickly, go find Kinzhuma!" Zhaxi crossed mountains and ridges, and escaped alone. Finally, he found the People's Liberation Army in Lhasa. The People's Liberation Army warmly entertained him and later arranged for him to work in the "August 1st" farm. Since then, Zhaxi began a new life. He increasingly realized how dark and cruel the serf system was pressing on the heads of the Tibetan people, and he increasingly saw how bright the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies were! Therefore, he often asked the cadres of the People's Liberation Army with expectant eyes: "When will democratic reforms be carried out in Tibet? When will the Tibetan people see the blue sky and the sun?"

Today, the wishes of the Tibetan people have begun to be realized! When these glorious representatives of the logistics units of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army passed by the Yarlung Zangbo River, through the streets of Lhasa, and along the Kangzang Highway, all they saw was a joyful new scene. On the streets of Lhasa, no more evil people carrying whips and showing off their power can be seen, nor can the reactionary Tibetan army, who beat foreign drums and blow foreign horns to humiliate women in the streets, be seen. People can walk around freely, each with a smile on their faces. In the Lhasa River Valley and on both sides of the Kangzang Highway, Tibetan farmers are even more smiling. They are shouting and driving the plowing cattle with red ribbons on their heads, plowing and sowing on their own land for the first time. Many young and strong soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are also busy in the fields, working with the Tibetan compatriots. On the vast and beautiful grasslands, the happy songs of the herdsmen are flying:

Golden sun, silver mountain,
The light of the Communist Party shines in our hearts.
Chairman Mao leads us to liberation,
The army quells the rebellion and helps production.
A happy life has begun,
The Tibetan people smile.
Holding a cup of highland barley wine high,
I only wish the flowers of happiness will be red for ten thousand years.

    他们感谢藏胞的热爱
    本报记者　成一　古凡　姜庆肇
    “我军平定西藏叛乱的胜利，是和广大藏族人民的支援分不开的。后勤工作能保证平叛部队的充分供应，也要感谢藏胞的热爱和支援。”这是西藏军区后勤部队的代表车俊贤大尉，在中国人民解放军第二届后勤工作先进单位和积极分子代表会议上，满怀感激和赞扬的心情所说的。他和许多来自平叛部队的后勤战士，都以亲身的经历，汇报了他们深受藏胞爱戴和热烈支援的事迹。
    西藏高原上，雪山草地，冰川峡谷，常常给平叛部队的进军带来许多困难。但是，不论白天或黑夜，每当部队走到哪里，哪里就有藏胞自动赶来架桥、修路、充当响导，或者组织起牦牛队支援大军运输。有一次，军医王秋平所在的部队为追剿叛匪进入一座雪山，道路生疏，难以继续前进。这时候，忽然来了一位七十多岁的藏族牧民多朗措吉，他自动地给部队带路。他告诉战士们，他们牧场上的许多青年人都被叛匪绑走了，妇女惨遭蹂躏，牦牛和食物遭到抢劫。牧民们唯一的希望是：“金珠玛米（解放军）快来为我们报仇！杀绝这些害人的魔鬼！”多朗措吉老人闪着愤怒的眼光，迈开结实的步子，带领部队整整走了一天一夜，爬过三座雪山，越过多处森林、峡谷和沼地，终于使平叛大军神速地追上残匪，一网打尽。战斗胜利后，战士们关心地问多朗措吉老人累不累，他扛着胜利品，喜笑颜开地说：“不累，不累！别看我年纪大了，也想着在消灭魔鬼以后，过几天好日子啊！”
    汽车运输部队的副政治指导员尚庆宜，讲述了他们的汽车队在完成繁重艰巨的运输任务中，处处受到藏胞支援的情形。他说：“如果没有藏胞的支援，我们的汽车队是寸步难行的。”
    在雪山草地间，汽车运输队经常遇到的不仅是道路艰险，气候恶劣，而且有许多公路和桥梁遭到叛匪破坏，使车辆不能通行。可是每一次困难，都在当地藏胞的积极支援下得到克服。有一次，正当尚庆宜率领的汽车队爬上一座名叫瓦龙其瓦的雪山坡上时，突然风雨交加，冰雹袭击，眼看把前面的一段陡坡公路冲垮了，车队无法继续前进。急得司机们只好跳下车来，冒着风雨和冰雹抢修道路，以便设法通行。就在这时候，忽然自远而近地传来了一阵阵“阿罗！”“阿罗！”的呼喊声，接着从森林里出现了三百多个身着老羊皮袄的藏胞，他们手执镢头和铁锨，策马奔来：“我们是本地人，知道这样天气路要坏，所以特地赶来。你们前面的汽车，也都是我们帮助拉上山的呀。”说罢，他们脱掉老羊皮袄和长筒马靴，打赤脚同战士们一起干起来。有的搬石头，有的铲土、垫路，一群小伙子还摆下泥球记数目，悄悄地同战士们展开友谊竞赛。热火朝天的劳动，整整持续了一个下午，坍塌的道路修复了。接着，藏胞们在路边燃起火把照明，他们和战士们一齐动手，把四十多辆满载物资的大卡车拉上了山顶。第二天清早，当朝阳爬上了雪峰，汽车队又要出发了。临行时，副指导员尚庆宜代表全体官兵，向藏胞献上了香烟和两袋炒面，作为答谢他们热情支援的礼物。藏胞们也祝贺汽车队“一路平安，吉祥如意！”
    在藏胞的热切关怀和奋力支援下，叛匪们破坏交通、企图阻止我军进军的阴谋屡遭失败。
    模范汽车驾驶员刘勤实说，在他和他的战友们所到之处，都可见到成群的男女藏胞，热情地帮助人民解放军工兵部队抢修被叛匪破坏的公路和桥梁。有些地方，工兵还未赶到，藏胞们就已经把公路和桥梁修好了。在一个名叫光盖山的雪山下，刘勤实和他的战友们刚驱车到达一条河边，就发现河上的木桥被叛匪烧着了，烟火熊熊。他们赶紧下车扑灭，抢救桥梁，这时候有十多个藏胞也从山上跑下来了，马上同战士们一起救火。但是这座桥已经烧毁了大半，汽车不能通行了。刘勤实等正在着急，藏胞们马上招呼来山上的人，同战士们一起伐木、运石，紧张劳动了一个下午，终于抢修起一座便桥。傍晚，刘勤实和他的战友们怀着激动的心情，谢别了可爱的藏胞，通过河川，翻越雪山，当夜把急需的物资送到前方，保证了平叛战斗的胜利。
    车俊贤大尉是从拉萨来的，他热烈赞扬和感激拉萨人民在支援人民解放军平息叛乱中所表现的勇敢和友爱精神。他说，3月21日下午，当人民解放军在拉萨市郊清除残余叛匪的时候，许多贫苦的市民纷纷赶来帮助部队抬担架、运子弹，一些纯朴善良的老大娘也毫无惧色地冒着炮火和枪声，赶来向战士们送酥油茶和奶渣。有一位五十多岁的老大娘，还每天黑夜向车俊贤他们驻地的哨位上送茶水，感动得战士们一再谢绝，这位可敬的老人却总是热泪汪汪地叨念着：“金珠玛米！你们辛苦了，你们是救命恩人！”她控诉叛匪杀害她一家人的血腥罪行，哭诉她一生度过的奴隶生涯，要求人民解放军早日帮助西藏人民脱离苦海，过自由和幸福的日子。
    车俊贤大尉还说，在拉萨平息叛乱后的第五天，全市的贫苦市民就自动组织起来一支千匹骆马的运输大队，向军区后勤领导机关要求给他们运输任务，支援大军进剿山南的散匪。许多藏族青年，还要求发给他们武器，协助人民解放军作战。有个藏族青年扎西，他是1953年从山南泽当地区逃跑到拉萨来的。那时候，正是青黄不接，本地的农奴主向他父亲逼粮逼债，老人家忍无可忍，说了几句反抗话，农奴主就当场用皮鞭、铁链等刑具，一气把老人活活打死了。扎西的母亲因此得病死去。一个世袭的农奴家庭只剩下扎西这个未成年的孩子了。可是狼心狗肺的农奴主仍不罢休，他还想把扎西打死。这时，邻居偷偷地告诉这个可邻的孤儿：“快跑吧，去找金珠玛米！”扎西翻山越岭，只身逃生，终于在拉萨找到了人民解放军。解放军热情地招待他，后来把他安置在“八一”农场做工。从此，扎西开始了新生。他越来越认识到压在西藏人民头上的农奴制度是多么黑暗、残酷，越来越看清了共产党和毛主席的民族政策是多么光明！因此，他常常闪烁着期望的目光，询问解放军的干部们：“什么时候在西藏进行民主改革？藏胞什么时候才能见到青天和太阳？”
    今天，西藏人民的愿望开始实现了！当人民解放军西藏军区后勤部队的这些光荣的代表们，在走过雅鲁藏布江畔，穿过拉萨街头和康藏公路的时候，他们看到的全是一幅喜气洋洋的新景象。在拉萨街头，已看不见身背皮鞭耀武扬威的恶人了，也看不见敲着洋鼓、吹着洋号在街头凌辱妇女的反动藏军了。人们可以自由地走来走去，个个喜笑颜开。在拉萨河谷和康藏公路的两旁，藏族农民们更是满面笑容，他们吆喝着头挂着红彩的耕牛，第一次在自己的土地上春耕播种。许多年青力壮的人民解放军战士，也忙碌在田野上同藏胞一起劳动。辽阔、美丽的草原上，飞扬着牧民的欢乐歌声：
    金色的太阳银色的山，
    共产党的光芒照心间。
    毛主席领导我们得解放，
    大军平叛又帮助生产。
    幸福的生活开始了，
    藏族人民笑开颜。
    双手高举一杯青稞酒，
    只愿幸福花儿红万年。
