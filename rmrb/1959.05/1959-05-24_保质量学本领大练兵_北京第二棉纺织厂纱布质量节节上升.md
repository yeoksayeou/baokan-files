Safeguarding Quality, Learning Skills, and Major Drills
Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's Yarn and Cloth Quality Rises Steadily

    (Our dispatch) The state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, in order to ensure the continuous improvement of product quality, is universally launching a technical training campaign in all workshops, centered on improving operational skills and aimed at improving quality and output. At present, this activity has been effective. In the past month or so, the factory's first-grade cotton yarn rate has increased from 87.4% to 95.17%; the first-grade rate of cotton cloth off the machine has increased from 83.16% to 90.91%; defective yarn has been reduced by more than half; and second-grade cloth has also been reduced by about 45%.
    This factory's mass technical training campaign started at the end of March. The factory established a technical training headquarters, including the deputy secretary of the Party committee, deputy director, chairman of the trade union, and deputy chief engineer. Each workshop also established offices. The offices first conducted a technical assessment, and based on the assessment combined with the key quality issues of each workshop, put forward specific training requirements. Each workshop, by trade, selected individuals with good quality, high output, and relatively high skills as pacesetters through mass discussion. For example, the weaving workshop selected forty-seven pacesetters for deputy foreman, loom operators, knotters, weft installers, oilers, and warp beam installers. On this basis, a heat wave of "learning from pacesetters, catching up with pacesetters," diligently studying and practicing, and improving skills was launched.
    In the training activities, each workshop and trade created many methods to learn and promote advanced experience. Workers in the combing and roving workshops first tackled the quality of cotton sliver and roving head wraps, because poor roving splices not only affect the uniformity of cotton yarn, but also cause second-grade cloth. They established a pacesetter column in the workshop, where the workshop instructors selected typical examples of good quality, which were announced in the pacesetter column at any time for everyone to observe and learn from. Some classes also set up technical research groups to specifically summarize and inspect the quality of splices, and were responsible for providing specific guidance to workers with poor technical skills. As a result, the splice quality of cotton sliver in this workshop quickly increased from 86.64% in March to 90.74%.
    Due to the rapid improvement of workers' technical skills, product quality also increased steadily. Before the major training campaign, fine yarn loom operators could only splice an average of 13.4 yarn ends per minute, and because some workers used a poor twisting method, the splice quality was poor, affecting the quality of yarn and cloth. After the major training campaign, the splicing speed per person per minute increased to 14.5 yarn ends, with a maximum of 22 yarn ends, basically eliminating the twisting method and improving the splice quality.
    Now, this factory's technical training campaign is undergoing the summary and evaluation of the previous stage. Eight hundred and fifty-eight people in the factory's five main workshops have reached the technical level of production experts.

### 保质量学本领大练兵  北京第二棉纺织厂纱布质量节节上升

    保质量学本领大练兵
    北京第二棉纺织厂纱布质量节节上升
    本报讯　国营北京第二棉纺织厂为了保证产品质量的不断提高，一个以提高操作技术为中心、以提高质量和产量为目的的技术大练兵活动，正在各车间普遍展开。目前，这一活动，已经收到成效。一个多月来，这个厂的棉纱上等一级品率已由87.4％提高到95.17％；棉布下机一等品率由83.16％提高到90.91％；坏纱减少了二分之一以上；次布也减少了45％左右。
    这个厂群众性的技术练兵活动是从3月底开始的。厂内成立了包括党委副书记、副厂长、工会主席、副总工程师等人参加的技术练兵指挥部，各车间也都成立了办公室。办公室首先进行了技术摸底，根据摸底情况结合各车间质量上的关键问题，提出具体的练兵要求。各个车间按工种通过群众讨论推选出质量好、产量高、技术较高的人为标兵。如织布车间就选出了副工长、挡车、帮接、装纬、加油、上轴等工种的标兵四十七名。在这一基础上掀起了“学标兵、赶标兵”苦学苦练、提高技术的热潮。
    在练兵活动中，各车间、各工种创造了许多方法来学习和推广先进经验。梳并粗车间职工首先围攻棉条和粗纱包头的质量，因为粗纱接头不良，不仅影响棉纱的均匀，而且会造成次布。他们在车间里建立了一个标兵栏，由车间教练员选拔出质量好的典型，在标兵栏随时公布，供大家观摩学习。有的班还成立了技术研究小组，专门总结和检查接头的质量，并负责对技术水平较差的工人进行具体辅导。结果，这个车间棉条的接头质量由3月份的86.64％，很快提高到了90.74％。
    由于职工技术水平的迅速提高，使产品质量也随着节节上升。细纱挡车工人在大练兵前，平均每人每分钟只能接头十三点四根，而且由于部分工人采用一种不良的拈头方法，接头质量不好，影响纱布的质量。大练兵后，每人每分钟的接头速度上升到十四点五根，最高达二十二根，基本消灭了拈头，提高了接头质量。
    现在这个厂的技术大练兵活动，正在进行前一阶段的总结评比。全厂五个主要车间已经有八百五十八人达到了生产能手的技术水平。
