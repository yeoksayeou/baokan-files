Although we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers geographically, our common goals and the great cause of socialist construction and safeguarding peace closely link us together.

We believe that the visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Hungary will further strengthen the cooperation and friendship between our two countries and peoples, and will also make new and significant contributions to strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp in the struggle for peace.
