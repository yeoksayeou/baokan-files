    Report from our newspaper: The Ceylon cabinet crisis, triggered by some right-wing ministers of the ruling party boycotting cabinet meetings in early May, has lasted for two weeks.
    In March of this year, Minister of Agriculture Philip Gunawardena proposed the Cooperative Bank Act. The purpose of this act is to eliminate the semi-feudal lending system that is still prevalent in rural Ceylon and to free farmers from the heavy exploitation of usurious loans. The bill stipulates a number of reform measures to provide better loan facilities in rural areas. After this bill was proposed, some right-wing ministers fiercely opposed its enactment under the pretext of "opposing the expansion of the powers of the Minister of Agriculture" and "preventing communism." In early May, they used the means of boycotting cabinet meetings to put pressure on the Prime Minister, demanding that Gunawardena be expelled from the cabinet.
    Prime Minister Bandaranaike once expressed his intention to take decisive action against those right-wing ministers who boycotted cabinet meetings. But later, he changed his decision and redivided the affiliated institutions of some cabinet ministries. In a government gazette published on May 15, it was announced that the Food Production Bureau, the Cooperative Bureau, and the Sales Bureau, which used to be under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (Minister Gunawardena), would be transferred to the Ministry of National Defense and Foreign Affairs, which is directly led by Bandaranaike; the original Ministry of Agriculture and Food was renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries; and the original Ministry of Industry and Fisheries was renamed the Ministry of Industry and Taxation. Ceylon's public opinion believes that Prime Minister Bandaranaike's approach is a concession to the pressure of the right wing, which is not conducive to resolving the cabinet crisis. The "Ceylon Light" published an editorial on the 17th, pointing out that the right-wing ministers took boycott action to cancel the power of the Ministry of Agriculture led by Gunawardena, and the Prime Minister took corresponding actions.
    When Prime Minister Bandaranaike notified the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Industry of his decision, the two ministers immediately wrote to the Prime Minister, requesting that the order be withdrawn. However, their request was rejected by the Prime Minister. On the afternoon of the 18th, Minister of Agriculture Philip Gunawardena and Minister of Industry William de Silva submitted their resignations to the Prime Minister. Subsequently, Rajapakshe, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce, also submitted his resignation. Gunawardena and de Silva are both leaders of the Ceylon Revolutionary Equal Society Party. They and three other members of the Revolutionary Equal Society Party in parliament also withdrew from the government parliamentary group of the People's United Front led by Bandaranaike. The Revolutionary Equal Society Party has two ministers in the cabinet and occupies five seats in the House of Representatives. On the 19th, Karunatilleke, Deputy Minister of Finance, and six others also withdrew from the Liberal Party, chaired by Bandaranaike, in opposition to the redistribution of ministerial functions.
    Prime Minister Bandaranaike said at a press conference on the 23rd, "I don't see any difficulties in continuing to govern, even if the ruling party may be a few seats short of an absolute majority in parliament in terms of seats."
    He said, "I believe the government will have an absolute majority, or at least have enough support from members of parliament who, even if they do not join the ruling party, are still willing to support the government to ensure it gets a comprehensive majority." He also said that he did not see any reason for the current government to resign.
    The current cabinet of Ceylon, headed by Prime Minister Bandaranaike, was formed after the general election in 1956. This is a government of the People's United Front. The Ceylon People's United Front was mainly formed by the Liberal Party led by Bandaranaike and the Revolutionary Equal Society Party in February 1956. It defeated the United National Party in the general election and came to power. In the election, it put forward promises to declare Ceylon a republic, gradually nationalize plantations, banks and insurance companies run by foreign colonialists, remove foreign military bases, implement a national planned economy, establish diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, and not participate in any major power blocs. This government has a term of five years, until the next general election in 1961. In the three years that it has been in power, under the leadership of Prime Minister Bandaranaike, the Ceylon government has done some work in fulfilling the election promises of the ruling party.
    Ceylon's political figures and public opinion pointed out that the cabinet crisis essentially reflects the struggle to maintain or violate the 1956 People's United Front election promises. The Chairman of the Ceylon Communist Party, Wickramasinghe, called on all progressive forces and organizations to take joint action to stop the right-wing offensive and defend the political achievements of 1956.
    The right-wing United National Party is taking advantage of the cabinet crisis to try to make a comeback. The party held a public gathering in Pamunugama near Colombo on the 16th, attacking the government led by Bandaranaike, and declared that the country must prepare for an early general election. The pro-Western "Ceylon Daily News" and "Observer" expressed satisfaction with Bandaranaike's decision on the 15th. The "Observer" also demanded further action, saying: "The real struggle has only just begun."

### 锡兰内阁危机继续发展  班达拉奈克说内阁不会辞职  锡共呼吁进步力量制止右翼攻势

    锡兰内阁危机继续发展
    班达拉奈克说内阁不会辞职
    锡共呼吁进步力量制止右翼攻势
    本报讯　5月初由于执政党的一些右派部长抵制内阁会议而引起的锡兰内阁危机，已历时两周。
    今年3月，农业部长菲利浦·古纳瓦德纳提出了合作银行法案。这项法案的目的在于消灭锡兰农村中仍然普遍存在的半封建的借贷制度，使农民摆脱高利贷的重利盘剥。这项法案规定了一些改革措施，以便在农村地区提供更好的贷款便利。这个法案提出后，一些右派部长借口“反对扩大农业部长权限”和“防止共产主义”，激烈地反对制定这个法案。5月初他们以抵制内阁会议的手段向总理施加压力，要求把古纳瓦德纳逐出内阁。
    班达拉奈克总理曾经表示对那些抵制内阁会议的右派部长采取果断的行动。但是到后来，他转而作出决定，重新划分内阁一些部的所属机构。在5月15日政府发表的公报中，宣布把过去属于农业和粮食部（部长古纳瓦德纳）领导的粮食生产局、合作社局和销售局改属由班达拉奈克直接领导的国防和外交部；原来的农业和粮食部改为农业和渔业部；原来的工业和渔业部改为工业和税务部。锡兰的舆论界认为班达拉奈克总理的这种作法是向右派的压力作了让步，因而不利于解决内阁危机。“锡兰之光报”17日发表社论指出，右派部长们采取抵制行动是要取消古纳瓦德纳领导的农业部的权力，而总理采取了相应的行动。
    当班达拉奈克总理把他的决定通知农业部长和工业部长时，这两位部长立即写信给总理，要求收回成命。但是，他们的要求被总理拒绝了。18日下午农业部长菲利浦，古纳瓦德纳和工业部长威廉·德西尔瓦向总理提出了辞职。接着，商业部驻议会秘书拉贾帕克萨也提出了辞职书。古纳瓦德纳和德西尔瓦都是锡兰革命平等社会党的领袖。他们还和另外三名革命平等社会党的议员，一起退出了由班达拉奈克领导的人民联合阵线的政府议会党团。革命平等社会党在内阁中有两个部长，在众议院占五席。19日，财政部次长卡鲁纳提莱凯等六人，为了反对重新划分部的职能，也退出了以班达拉奈克为主席的自由党。
    班达拉奈克总理23日在记者招待会上说，我看不出在继续执政方面有困难，即使就席位而言执政党在议会中取得绝对多数可能还短少几个席位。
    他说，我认为政府将拥有绝对多数，或者至少获得足够多的议员的支持保证，他们即使不参加执政党，仍然愿意支持政府以保证它获得全面的多数。他又说，他看不出现政府有什么理由辞职。
    以班达拉奈克总理为首的锡兰现内阁，是1956年大选后产生的。这是一个人民联合阵线的政府。锡兰人民联合阵线主要是由班达拉奈克领导的自由党和革命平等社会党于1956年2月组成的。它在大选中击败了统一国民党而执政。它在选举中提出了主张宣布锡兰为共和国、把外国殖民者经营的种植园、银行和保险公司逐渐收归国有、撤除外国军事基地、实行国家计划经济，以及同中苏建立外交关系、不参加任何大国集团等诺言。这个政府任期五年，到1961年下届大选时为止。在已执政的三年中间，在班达拉奈克总理领导下，锡兰政府在实践执政党竞选诺言方面作了一些工作。
    锡兰的政界人士和广大舆论指出，这次内阁危机实质上反映了维护还是违背1956年人民联合阵线竞选诺言的斗争。锡兰共产党主席魏克马沁格呼吁所有进步力量和组织采取联合行动来制止右翼的攻势，保卫1956年的政治成果。
    右派的统一国民党正在利用内阁危机企图卷土重来。这个党16日在科伦坡附近的帕穆努加马举行公众集会，攻击班达拉奈克领导的政府，并且扬言，国家必须为早日举行大选作好准备。亲西方的“锡兰每日新闻”和“观察家报”对班达拉奈克15日的决定表示满意。“观察家报”还要求再进一步，它说：“真正的斗争现在才开始。”
