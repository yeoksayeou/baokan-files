Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st. The Chief Minister of Kerala, India, Namboodiripad, returned to Kerala on the evening of the 20th from New Delhi after meeting with Prime Minister Nehru.

Namboodiripad told the press on the 20th that the main purpose of his visit was to inform Prime Minister Nehru of the possible repercussions of the statewide movement against the state government that the managers of private schools in Kerala are preparing to launch, and how the state government intends to deal with this situation.

Namboodiripad spoke at a mass rally held here on the 20th about the forces opposing the Kerala state government, which are jointly composed of the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League. He also said that they are afraid of the huge changes that will take place before the next election, when the Kerala state government will implement various reforms. He pointed out that the initiators of the movement against the state government hope to link the school closure movement with a series of other movements, all of which are aimed at the state government. They are attempting to create a situation that forces the Kerala state government to resign, or to establish a center for interventionist purposes.

Earlier, Namboodiripad said at a press conference that the state's education bill will be implemented from June 1st, and the movement against the state government will also begin from June 1st. He said that his government has the confidence to cope with this situation with the support of the majority of the people.

According to the Indian News Agency, mass rallies supporting the Communist state government have recently been organized in various central districts of Kerala. In Ernakulam, 150,000 people attended a mass rally convened by the Communist Party to celebrate the Ernakulam District Conference of the Communist Party. They shouted slogans supporting the Communist government and condemning attempts to overthrow the Kerala state government.

    印度喀拉拉邦首席部长说
    邦政府有信心对付反对运动
    新华社新德里21日电　印度喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德在同尼赫鲁总理会谈之后在20日晚上从新德里回到喀拉拉邦。
    南布迪里巴德20日对报界说，他来此访问的主要目的，是让尼赫鲁总理知道在喀拉拉邦的私人学校的管理者们准备进行全邦性的反对邦政府的运动可能引起的反响，以及邦政府打算如何对付这一局面。
    南布迪里巴德20日在这里举行的一次群众集会上，谈到了由国大党、人民社会党和穆斯林联盟联合组成的反对喀拉拉邦政府的力量。他同时说，它们害怕在下次选举之前将发生巨大的变化，那时候喀拉拉邦政府将实行各种改革。他指出，反对邦政府运动的发起人们，希望把学校的关闭运动和其他一系列的运动连系在一起，而所有这一切运动都是针对邦政府的。它们企图造成迫使喀拉拉邦政府辞职的情况，或者将建立目的在于进行干涉的中心。
    早些时候，南布迪里巴德在一次记者招待会上说，邦的教育法案将从6月1日开始执行，而反对邦政府的运动也将从6月1日开始。他说，他的政府有着在大多数人民的支持下应付这种局势的信心。
    据印度新闻社报道，喀拉拉邦的各个中心区最近都组织了支持共产党邦政府的群众大会。在埃纳库拉姆有十五万人出席了由共产党召开的庆祝共产党埃纳库拉姆区会议的群众集会。他们高呼支持共产党政府和谴责想推翻喀拉拉邦政府的企图的口号。
