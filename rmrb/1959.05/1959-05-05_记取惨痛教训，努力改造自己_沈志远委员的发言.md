Chairman, fellow committee members:

First, please allow me to express my heartfelt support for Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian's reports on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan and the state budget, respectively, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC.

As a criminal against the people, I still have the opportunity today to participate in this national highest political consultative organization's conference. I cannot help but feel deeply moved and, at the same time, deeply ashamed by the Party and the people's generous treatment of me.

In the year and eight months since I bowed my head and confessed my guilt to the people in August two years ago, I have had continuous opportunities for learning, undergoing labor training in the countryside, visiting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and the people's communes, and participating in the China Democratic League Congress, and other series of socialist education opportunities. This has been of great help to my transformation.

Thanks to the Party's constant rescue and education, the masses' supervision and help, the encouragement and spur of the nationwide Great Leap Forward situation, and my own continuous learning, reflection, and observation, I have begun to gradually change my attitude and feelings towards the Party, and increasingly deepen my understanding and hatred of my past crimes of frantically attacking the Party. Recalling that in the summer of two years ago, the Party launched a massive anti-Rightist struggle in a timely manner, awakening me from the sinful dream of being against the people, making me realize my ugly face for the first time in my life, giving me the opportunity to begin washing away all the filth in the depths of my soul, and thus keenly feeling the urgent need to carry out fundamental transformation. For a person like me who has committed unforgivable crimes against the people, the Party not only tries its best to save me, help me recognize my mistakes, and give me extremely lenient treatment, but also repeatedly extends a warm hand to arrange opportunities for me to accelerate my self-transformation and become a new person. What else can I say except to express my heartfelt gratitude and tears of emotion for the Party's repeated rescue, education, and painstaking care for my transformation?

I stumbled badly in the historical tide of the socialist revolution, which is by no means accidental. Of course, it hurts to stumble. In order to carry out effective transformation, I must learn from this painful experience.

Some people say, Shen Zhiyuan read many books on Marxism-Leninism, why did he still inevitably degenerate into a Rightist? The implication is that studying Marxism-Leninism is also useless. However, the fact is the opposite. According to my own personal experience, my fall into a bourgeois Rightist was precisely not because I learned too much Marxism-Leninism, but because I did not truly learn any Marxism-Leninism. Here, first of all, there is the question of what position and attitude to take towards Marxism-Leninism. As for me, I started learning Marxism-Leninism with the shameful motive of personal fame and position; I regarded Marxist-Leninist theory as a tool for seizing fame and gain, and never wanted to use Marxism-Leninism as my ideological weapon to serve the proletarian revolutionary cause, but rather tried to make Marxism-Leninism something that served me personally. That is to say, I adopted an anti-Marxist-Leninist position and attitude to treat Marxism-Leninism, of course, I will never be able to learn it in my lifetime.

Adopting such a position and attitude to treat Marxism-Leninism, in terms of method, is bound to be a disconnection between words and deeds, a disconnection between learning and application, and a disconnection between theory and practice, treating Marxist-Leninist theory as dogma; but in the face of realistic political issues, it falls to the revisionist position of moving towards capitalist restoration. When major storms occur in politics, it inevitably degenerates into a criminal who wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism to attack the Party and socialism. For me, this is a painful lesson worth remembering forever.

Premier Zhou's report comprehensively and brilliantly expounded the unprecedented great achievements that our people have made under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during the First Five-Year Plan and the Great Leap Forward in 1958, as well as the great significance and far-reaching influence of the Party's general line of socialist construction and all its guidelines, policies, and measures that promoted these great achievements. According to my personal experience, the most fundamental reason for obtaining these unprecedented victories and achievements is that the Party's general line and all its guidelines, policies, and measures completely and correctly reflect the requirements of the laws of social development in our country and express the fundamental interests and will of the 650 million people. These objective laws of social historical development, such as the inevitable victory of socialism over capitalism, and the superstructure must adapt to the economic base and serve the economic base, etc., I have been paying lip service to for decades, but during the Great Leap Forward two years ago, I was blinded by greed and, in the posture of Don Quixote, holding the anti-Party and anti-socialist spear, I even attempted to challenge this selfless law of social historical development and the firm will of the 650 million people. After the Three Great Transformations in 1956, our country achieved a decisive revolutionary victory of socialism over capitalism on the economic front, and the social economic base has changed from a multi-component economy to a basically single socialist economy. At this time, the laws of historical development urgently require the superstructure of politics and ideology to catch up quickly and serve to consolidate and further develop the socialist economic base. Therefore, the historical task of launching a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has been put on the agenda. Chairman Mao's theory of correctly handling contradictions among the people and the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and “let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" were precisely put forward to carry out this great historical task. However, due to my standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, I made completely wrong estimates of the objective situation at that time and carried out completely reactionary distortions of the Party's guidelines and policies. I distorted the development of socialist democracy and the correct handling of contradictions among the people into returning to the reactionary bourgeois democracy and freedom; I distorted "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" into negating the Communist Party's leadership relationship over democratic parties and demanding equal footing; I distorted the policy of “let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" into unconditional blooming and contending, allowing the poisonous weeds of bourgeois science, literature, and art to flood freely, vainly attempting to overthrow the guiding position of Marxism in the cultural and academic fields; I distorted the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals into only uniting but not transforming, and also distorted uniting into merely unilaterally taking care of and "respecting" bourgeois intellectuals, in essence, it was to ask the working class's Party to "respect" the old intellectuals' bourgeois positions and viewpoints. In this way, on the issue of intellectuals, I embarked on the road of anti-unity and anti-transformation, thereby vainly attempting to usurp the working class's leadership over cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings. In short, my view of the domestic situation at that time and the propositions I put forward according to this wrong view were resisting the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, that is, resisting the objective law of social development that the superstructure must be adapted to the economic base and serve the consolidation and development of the economic base, and at the same time, it was also resisting the fundamental interests and will of the 650 million people. Resisting the laws of social development and the will of the people across the country is bound to bring a tragic result of bloodshed to oneself. For me, this is another painful lesson worth remembering for life. From this painful lesson, it is also fully proved that although I have been in contact with Marxist-Leninist books for two or thirty years, I have actually not learned even a little bit of Marxism-Leninism. My past words and actions are undeniably proving that I am a thorough anti-Marxist-Leninist.

That's how it is, I used Marxist-Leninist words as a cloak to cover up my crimes against the Party and socialism. That's how it is, for a long time I used Marxist rhetoric to disguise myself, poisoned many people, and also seriously harmed myself. But now I begin to understand that using revolutionary rhetoric to disguise oneself can deceive for a period of time, and can also deceive some people with dull senses or political naiveté, but it can absolutely not deceive the discerning eyes of the people, and it can absolutely not deceive the ruthless laws of historical development.

Remembering lessons is to correct mistakes and avoid repeating serious mistakes of the same nature.

Having stumbled, I want to get up. The purpose of getting up is to thoroughly transform myself in order to contribute a share of strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. Drawing lessons from past mistakes, in the future, I must honestly and earnestly learn Marxism, and strive to ensure that every time I learn a little, I must make it my own. Recently, the leaders of the Shanghai Socialist Academy, where I am participating in learning, have repeatedly called on us to jump out of the circle and sit in the correct position, and try to use the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to learn Marxism-Leninism, and gradually achieve consistency between learning and application. For me, this is truly a prescription that hits the nail on the head, a sharp and incisive instruction. What needs to be jumped out of is the circle of using the bourgeois position and attitude to treat Marxism-Leninism, the circle of class prejudice and personal gains and losses; sitting in the correct position means that when learning, we must sit in the position of the working class, sit in the direction of looking at all problems from the fundamental interests of the 650 million people, and at the same time require us to strive to achieve learning and application simultaneously, and consistency between learning and application. I think that if we persist in such a learning method for a long time, the change in position and viewpoint can be gradually changed from reluctant to not reluctant, and gradually expand from learning life to work, labor, social practice, and all life, such learning is obviously of great benefit to promoting my position transformation and ideological transformation.

On the other hand, the main root cause of my mistakes is because I stood in a position of confrontation with the working people to treat all problems. For a long time, I paid lip service to "labor creates the world," and "the producers of material wealth are the true creators of history," but in my true thoughts, I have always despised labor and belittled the working people, thinking that only intellectuals are smart, capable, pure, and noble, while workers and peasants are stupid, clumsy, and filthy. After several visits and several months of labor practice, observation, and contact with peasants in suburban rural areas, I found that my original view of the working people was completely absurd. I have personally seen groups of men, women, old, and young heroes on the agricultural front with soaring enthusiasm and great momentum. They have created unprecedented great achievements in agricultural production, water conservancy construction, the movement to reform agricultural tools, and the various construction tasks of the people's communes. They not only have the communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, but also have the spirit, perseverance, and wisdom of hard work, practical work, and skillful work. They are revolutionary practitioners who are down-to-earth. And in the past, due to my reactionary class nature, I have been divorced from reality, divorced from production, divorced from and even confronted the working masses for a long time, talking eloquently all day long, indulging in the circle of personal gains and losses without shame, but proud of it. When I stand in front of those labor models and high-yielders with noble moral qualities, I truly feel "ashamed of my inferiority." I cannot see the general trend of the times, and I vainly attempt to drag the galloping wheels of history backward, reluctant to part with corrupt and reactionary things. In this way, I have only begun to understand the truth that the so-called "noble are the most stupid" and "the lowly are the most intelligent." In order to thoroughly transform myself, I want to ask the leaders to give me the opportunity to participate in production practice or service practice for a relatively long time (such as participating in the work of the people's commune), so that I have more opportunities to learn from the peasant brothers in the commune: learn their noble qualities of socialist collectivism, learn their spirit of arduous struggle and down-to-earth hard work, and more importantly, learn their unreserved acceptance of the Party's leadership and their loyal and unwavering fighting spirit of resolutely implementing the Party's general line and all guidelines and policies with soaring enthusiasm and selfless labor.

Fellow committee members, after more than a year of learning, labor, and social observation, although my original position has begun to have some changes, and my ideological understanding has also had some changes and improvements, the progress I have made is still far from what the objective situation requires of me and what the Party and the people expect of me. In the past year and eight months, my progress on the road of transformation has been very slow, my demands on myself have not been high enough and strict enough, and my attitude towards transformation has not been down-to-earth enough. The main reason is that I lacked understanding of the long-term, arduous, and repetitive nature of transformation in the past. In a period after the confession two years ago, I thought that the change of position was very easy. I thought that I had made up my mind to repent, examined the mistakes I had made and their roots, and firmly expressed that I would always absolutely accept the Party's leadership and take the socialist road, so the position had already been transformed almost. Later, after learning and the help of the organization, I began to seem to have a little understanding of the long-term, arduous, and repetitive nature of transformation, but it was still half-believing and very vague. Then, after three and a half months of combined training and transformation of going to the countryside for labor, learning, and life, I gradually realized that there were still many problems with me, and some problems were old problems that had been deeply rooted for decades, such as being afraid of face-to-face sharp struggle, showing weakness and a tendency to reconciliation in fierce and complex political struggles; sometimes I still couldn't let go of airs and face; when I made a little achievement in the process of transformation, I would have blind optimism or thoughts of quick victory; if I was criticized more or heavier or found that I had many problems, I would have a dejected mood; one time I was complacent, and another time I was inferior; if I understood some problems, I would have conflicts on other problems; today I understood, and in a few days I would not understand; I understood on principle, but I did not understand in the face of concrete problems; I understood rationally, but I did not understand emotionally; I lacked a clear head about other people's mistakes, and I had a vague head about my own problems; sometimes I resolutely tried to jump out of the circle of personal gains and losses, and another time I instinctively wandered back and forth in this circle. Similar situations, in the past period, I had many personal experiences. Thus, I began to have a relatively real preliminary understanding of the long-term, arduous, and repetitive nature of transformation.

In response to this situation, in order to effectively carry out fundamental transformation, I must make full mental preparations, face up to the arduous and repetitive nature of transformation, check myself at all times, prepare for a long-term self-struggle, and honestly expose my true ideological activities to the Party and the organization in order to win their help. All concerns about concealing illness for fear of treatment will cause harm to my transformation, and I must resolutely eliminate them. I have learned that self-transformation must be honest and cannot be faked at all, cannot be clever, cannot take shortcuts, and cannot take detours; it is impossible to transform well if you say one thing and think another. In the future, I must further make up my mind, and under the leadership and education of the Party, and under the supervision and help of the organization and the masses, I must double my efforts and accelerate the pace to transform myself. Especially important is to give my heart to the Party, wholeheartedly listen to the Party's words, and respect and support the Party as if it were my parents who gave me life, and repay the Party and the people's high kindness and great virtue of trying their best to save and educate me with practical actions of honest and hard work to transform myself.

If there are any mistakes in the above speech, please give me strict criticism and correction, fellow committee members!

    记取惨痛教训，努力改造自己
    沈志远委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    首先请允许我对于周总理的政府工作报告、李富春、李先念副总理分别关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案和国家预决算的报告，和李维汉副主席的二届政协全国委员会常委会工作报告，表示衷心的拥护。
    我以一个人民罪人的身份，今天仍有机会参加这个全国最高的政治协商机构的大会，对于党和人民给我这样宽大的待遇，我不能不从心底里感到万分的感奋，同时又万分的惭愧。
    自从前年八月我向人民低头认罪以来的一年零八个月中间，我得到了不断的学习，下乡劳动锻炼，农业大跃进和人民公社的参观，以及参加民盟代表大会等一系列社会主义教育的机会。这对于我的改造帮助是很大的。
    由于党对我的不断挽救和教育，群众对我的监督和帮助，全国大跃进形势对我的鼓舞和鞭策，以及自己不断地学习、反省和观察，我开始逐步地改变对党的态度和感情，日益加深地认识和痛恨自己过去向党猖狂进攻的罪恶。回忆前年夏季党及时地发动了声势浩大的反右派斗争，把我从反人民的罪恶迷梦中打醒，使我生平第一次开始认识到自己的丑恶面貌，使我有机会来开始清洗自己灵魂深处的全部肮脏，从而痛切地感觉到自己有进行根本改造的迫切需要。对于像我这样一个对人民犯了不可饶恕的罪行的人，党不仅千方百计地来挽救我，帮助我认识错误，给我以非常宽大的处理，而且还一再伸出温暖的手给我安排加速自我改造重做新人的机会。我对于党对我的一再挽救教育和费尽心机的关怀我的改造，除了衷心地感激涕零而外，还有什么话说呢？
    我在社会主义革命的历史巨浪中栽了一个大跟斗，这绝对不是偶然的。栽了跟斗当然痛，为了有效地进行改造，我必须痛定思痛，好好地从这中间记取惨痛的教训。
    有人说，沈志远读了很多马列主义的书，为什么仍不免蜕变成为右派？言外之意是学了马列主义也不中用。然而事实与此相反，依我
  自己的亲身体会，我之堕落为资产阶级右派，恰恰不是因为学多了马列主义而是一点也没有
  真正地学进马列主义。这里首先有一个从什么立场、用什么态度来对待马列主义的问题。以我来说，我是一开始就抱着个人名位的可耻动机去学习马列主义的；我把马列主义理论当作攫取名利地位的工具，而从来没有想把马列主义作为自己为无产阶级革命事业服务的思想武器，倒是企图使马列主义成为为我个人服务的东西。这就是说，我是采取反马列主义的立场和态度来对待马列主义，当然一辈子也学不成。
    采取这样的立场和态度去对待马列主义，在方法上就必然是言行脱节、学用脱节、理论和实践脱节，把马列主义理论当作教条来对待；而在现实的政治问题面前却落到了走向资本主义复辟的修正主义立场上，一遇到政治上发生大风巨浪时，就不可避免地堕落成为披着马列主义外衣来向党向社会主义进攻的罪人。对我来说，这是一个值得永远记住的惨痛教训。
    周总理的报告全面而精辟地阐明了：第一个五年计划期间和一九五八年大跃进中我国人民在中国共产党领导下所取得的史无前例的伟大成就，以及促成这些伟大成就的党的社会主义建设总路线和一切方针政策措施的伟大意义和深远影响。依我个人的体会，这些史无前例的胜利和成就的获得，最根本的原因是由于党的总路线和一切方针政策措施都完全正确地体现了我国社会发展规律的要求，表达了六亿五千万人民的根本利益和意志。这些社会历史发展的客观规律，例如社会主义必然战胜和代替资本主义，上层建筑一定要适应经济基础并为经济基础服务等等，我过去挂在口头上已有几十年，可是在前年大鸣大放期间我却利令智昏，以唐·吉呵德的姿态，手执反党反社会主义的长矛，竟企图向这种铁面无私的社会历史发展规律，向六亿五千万人民的坚决意志来挑战了。一九五六年三大改造以后，我国在经济战线上取得了社会主义对于资本主义的决定性的革命胜利，社会的经济基础已从多成分的经济变成了基本上单一的社会主义经济。这时历史发展规律急迫地要求政治和思想等上层建筑赶快跟上去，为筑固和进一步发展社会主义经济基础服务，因而在政治战线和思想战线上展开一次社会主义革命的历史任务，就被提到行动日程上来了。毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的学说和党的“长期共存、互相监督”、“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针正是为执行这一伟大的历史任务而提出来的。可是我由于站在反动的资产阶级立场，对当时的客观形势作了完全错误的估计，对党的方针政策进行了完全反动的歪曲。我把发展社会主义民主、正确处理人民内部矛盾歪曲成为退回到反动的资产阶级的民主自由；我把“长期共存、互相监督”歪曲成为否定共产党对民主党派的领导关系而要求分庭抗礼；我把“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策歪曲成为无条件地鸣放，让资产阶级科学文艺思想的毒草自由泛滥，妄图推翻马克思主义在文化学术领域内的指导地位；我把党对知识分子的团结、教育、改造的政策歪曲成为只团结不改造，而又把团结歪曲成为仅仅对资产阶级知识分子片面的照顾和“尊重”，实质上是要工人阶级的党“尊重”旧知识分子的资产阶级立场和观点。这样，我在知识分子的问题上，就走上了反团结反改造的道路，从而妄图纂夺工人阶级对于文教科学事业的领导权。总而言之，我当时对国内形势的看法和按照这种错误看法所提出的主张是在反抗政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，也就是反抗上层建筑必须与经济基础相适应并为经济基础的巩固和发展服务的社会发展客观规律，同时也是反抗六亿五千万人民的根本利益和意志。而对社会发展规律和全国人民的意志进行反抗，必然要给自己招来头破血流的可悲结果。这对我来说，是又一个值得永生记取的惨痛教训。从这个惨痛教训中，也充分证明了，我虽然接触了二、三十年马列主义的书本，实际上我却一丝一毫马列主义也没有学进去，我过去的言论和行动倒是无可辩驳地证明我是一个彻头彻尾的反马列主义者。
    就是这样的，我把马克思列宁主义的辞句当作了掩护反党反社会主义罪行的外衣。就是这样的，长期以来我用马克思主义的辞句粉饰了自己，毒害了许多人，同时也严重地害了自己。但现在开始明白，用革命的辞藻粉饰自己，可以蒙混过一个时期，也可以蒙混过一些嗅觉迟钝或政治上幼稚的人，却绝对蒙混不过人民的巨眼，绝对蒙混不过无情的历史发展规律。
    记取教训是为了改正错误、避免再犯同样性质的严重错误。
    栽了跟斗，我要爬起来。爬起来的目的是为了彻底地改造自己，以便为祖国的社会主义建设贡献一分力量。从过去的错误中汲取教训，今后我一定要老老实实、认认真真地学习马克思主义，要努力做到每学一点，都要使它成为我自己的东西。最近我在参加学习的上海市社会主义学院的领导一再号召我们要跳出圈子、坐正位置，试用马列主义的立场、观点、方法来学习马列主义，逐步做到学用一致。对我来说，这真是对症下药、一针见血的指示。要跳出的就是用资产阶级立场、态度来对待马列主义的圈子，阶级偏见和个人得失的圈子；坐正位置就是在学习的时候一定要坐到工人阶级的位置上来，坐到从六亿五千万人的根本利益出发来看一切问题的方位上来，同时要求努力做到边学边用，学用一致。我想如果长期坚持这样的学习方法，立场观点的改变可以由勉强逐步地变为不勉强，由学习生活逐步扩展到工作、劳动、社会实践和全部生活中去，这样的学习显然对于推动我的立场改造和思想改造是大有益处的。
    另一方面，我犯错误的主要根源是因为我站在与劳动人民对抗的地位上来对待一切问题。长时期来我口头上空谈“劳动创造世界”，“物质财富的生产者是历史的真正创造者”，而我的真实思想中却一贯地鄙视劳动、轻视劳动人民，认为只有知识分子是聪明能干的、纯洁高尚的，而工人农民却是愚蠢、粗笨、龌龊的。经过若干次参观和在郊区农村几个月的劳动实践、观察和同农民的接触，我发觉自己原来对劳动人民的看法完全是荒谬绝伦的。我亲眼看到了农业战线上一群群干劲冲天、气魄伟大的男女、老少的英雄们。他们在农业生产上、在水利建设上、在农具改革运动上、在人民公社的各项建设工作上，都创造了空前未有的伟绩。他们既具有敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，更具有苦干、实干、巧干的精神、毅力和智慧。他们是脚踏实地的革命实践家。而我过去由于自己反动的阶级本质，长时期来脱离实际、脱离生产、脱离乃至对抗劳动群众，整天夸夸其谈，沉迷在个人得失的圈子中而不以为耻，反以为荣。当我站在那些具有高尚道德品质的劳动模范、丰产能手们面前时，就真正感到“自惭形秽”。我看不清时代的大势，妄图把飞奔前进的历史车轮拖向后转，对腐朽反动的东西恋恋不舍。这样我才初步明白了所谓
  “高贵者”最愚蠢、“卑贱者”最聪明的道理。为了彻底改造自己，我要请求领导上给我机会，让我比较长时间地参加生产实践或服务实践
  （如参加人民公社的工作），使我有多多向公社农民弟兄们学习的机会：学习他们社会主义集体主义的崇高品质，学习他们艰苦卓绝、脚踏实地的苦干实干精神，更重要的是学习他们无条件接受党的领导，并以冲天干劲、忘我劳动坚决贯彻党的总路线和一切方针政策的忠贞不贰的战斗精神。
    各位委员，经过了一年多的学习、劳动和社会观察，我原来的立场虽已开始有了一些变化，我的思想认识虽也多少有了一些转变和提高，但是我所得到的进展同客观形势对我的要求、同党和人民对我的期望比较起来，距离还远得很。一年零八个月来，我在改造的途程上进展得很缓慢，对自己的要求还不够高不够严，对改造的态度还不够踏实。主要的原因是我过去对改造的长期性、艰巨性和反复性缺乏认识。在前年交代以后的一个时期内，我以为立场转变是很容易的。我想我已下了悔改的决心，检查了自己所犯的错误及其根源，坚决表示要永远绝对接受党的领导，走社会主义的道路，这样立场就已经转变得差不多了。后来经过学习和组织的帮助，对改造的长期性、艰巨性、反复性才开始似乎有了一点认识，但仍是半信半疑的、很模糊的。接着又经过了三个半月下乡劳动、学习、生活三结合的锻炼改造，逐渐发觉自己身上的问题还多得很，有些问题还是几十年来根深蒂固的老毛病，例如害怕面对面的尖锐斗争，在激烈复杂的政治斗争中表现得软弱和调和倾向；有时架子、面子还放不下来；在改造过程中有了点滴成就，就产生盲目乐观或速胜思想；对我批评得多些重些或发觉自己有许多毛病，就产生灰溜溜的情绪；一个时候自满，另一个时候又自卑；在某些问题上搞通了，在另一些问题上又发生抵触；今天通了，过几天又不通；在原则问题上通了，在具体问题面前又不通；理智上通了，情感上又不通；对别人的错误缺点头脑清醒，对自己的毛病头脑又模糊了；有时候坚决试图跳出个人得失的圈子，另一时候又本能地在这个圈子里来去徘徊。诸如此类的情况，在过去一个时期，我的亲身体会是很多的。从而我就开始对改造的长期性、艰巨性和反复性有了比较真切的初步认识。
    针对这种情况，为了有效地进行根本改造，我一定要做好充分的精神准备，正视改造的艰巨性、反复性，时时刻刻检查自己，准备进行长期的自我斗争，把自己的真实思想活动老老实实地向党向组织暴露，以便争取他们的帮助。一切讳疾忌医的顾虑，会给自己的改造带来损害，我必须坚决予以排除。我体会到自我改造必须老老实实，一点也不能掺假，不能取巧，不能抄近路，走捷径；嘴上一套、心里又是一套，是永远没法改造好的。今后我一定要进一步痛下决心，在党的领导和教育下，在组织和群众的监督和帮助下，加倍努力、加快步伐来改造自己，尤其重要的是要把心交给党，一心一意地听党的话，把党当作生我养我的父母一般地来敬重和拥护，用老老实实努力改造的实际行动来报答党和人民对我千方百计的挽救和教育的高恩厚德。
    以上发言如有错误，请委员们给我以严格的批评和纠正！
