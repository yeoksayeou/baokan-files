New Bases in the Great Leap Forward
By Our Correspondents Sha Yin and Yin Huai

Taiyuan is a city that has grown up during China's large-scale economic construction. In the early days of liberation, there was only a simple steel factory and several machinery repair shops. After the construction of the First Five-Year Plan and the Great Leap Forward of last year, it has become a socialist industrial city with factories and magnificent buildings.

A Glimpse of "Qifufen"

Turning from the shady Wuyi Road to Shengli Street, and heading north on the north-south Liberation Street, passing through Taiyuan's old industrial area, you arrive at Qifufen Station. Standing on the edge of the asphalt road, you can see a panoramic view of the Qifufen Station under construction.

The station is piled with goods waiting to be transported: circular concrete high-voltage poles, black steel, huge dark blue heavy cranes, as well as boxed machinery and packaged industrial products. Locomotives are roaring and speeding, people are busily unloading and attaching cars, trucks are constantly driving out, and trucks fully loaded with supplies are driving in.

Trains whistle crisply as they depart from here, loaded with steel, machinery, chemical reagents, agricultural implements, pesticides, and textiles, heading to Beijing, Wuhan, Sanmenxia, and Baotou. These trains speed to the major cities and rural areas of socialist construction across the country.

Construction of Qifufen Station began in October 1957. Once completed, it will be a marshalling station within the Taiyuan hub station. Currently, trains in Taiyuan are still being marshalled at Taiyuan North Station, southeast of Qifufen. According to Comrade Guo Kai of the Taiyuan Office of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, Taiyuan North Station, which is currently responsible for marshalling, handles approximately 1,740 train cars per day. The most significant change in transportation in the Taiyuan area is the substantial increase in output. In 1956, the outbound volume of the city's major stations was just over 60% of the inbound volume. In 1957, the outbound volume exceeded the inbound volume by more than 600,000 tons, an increase of more than double that of 1956. The change this year will be even greater. Precisely because of this change, Taiyuan North Station can no longer meet the demands of production. The Qifufen marshalling station is expected to be handed over by the end of this year, at which point transportation conditions will be greatly improved.

New Look of the Northern Suburbs

Leaving the "North Gate" and crossing the railway, a wide and flat asphalt road stretches north. Along both sides of this road, factory buildings stand side by side, and chimneys rise densely. The complex sounds of motors, air horns, turning lathes, speeding trains, and boiling steel furnaces travel for miles. This spectacular scene stretches from the old city's North Gate, heading west for about forty miles, reaching Lancun, the source of the Fen River. The famous Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company is located in the northern suburbs, and Taigang is currently undergoing a massive expansion project. New factory buildings, several or even dozens of times larger than the original ones, are being erected one after another. From afar, one can see the dazzling electric welding sparks on the tall frames. The new blast furnace stands like a giant, soaring into the clouds. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, after renovation and expansion, produces mining machinery that is distributed to geological exploration sites from the vast Gobi Desert in the Northwest to the towering mountains of Jiangnan. The northern suburbs of Taiyuan are an old industrial area. From Heping Road northward, there are newly built factories and buildings everywhere.

Beautiful Scenery on the West Bank of the Fen River

Traveling west along Yingze Street, the main axis of transportation in Taiyuan City, and crossing the Yingze Bridge over the Fen River, you enter the Hexi industrial area. It faces the northern suburban industrial area across the river.

Although the Hexi industrial area has industries such as cement, coal washing, textiles, and coal, it is mainly a machinery industry. The famous Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant and Jinxi Machinery Plant are both built here.

The start of construction of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant once cheered the people of the whole country. Now, on a land area of more than a thousand acres, thirty workshops are nearing completion. At the time of liberation, Taiyuan only had mechanical repair industry, but no mechanical manufacturing industry. In just a few years, many machinery manufacturing plants have been built here. The construction and commissioning of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant has provided Taiyuan's machinery industry with a relatively complete scale. Taiyuan can not only produce the smallest precision machines for manufacturing watches, and various mining machinery, machine tools, and power generation machinery from the Taihang Instrument Factory, but also produce heavy machinery. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, a large number of new products have been produced. Not long ago, it produced a 760mm thin plate rolling mill and a 270-ton crane. These products are very large, generally weighing around 600,000 to 1,000,000 catties, and some even weigh nearly 10,000,000 catties. According to the person in charge of the factory, once the entire factory is put into production, the products produced in one year would require more than 2,800 train cars to transport.

To the west of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is the Jinxi Machinery Plant. Many machine tools, metallurgical equipment, and power generation machinery are produced in this factory.

West of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is the Xishan of Taiyuan. This is a coking coal producing area. The Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine, together with the Dongshan Coal Mine, extracts 6 million tons of raw coal from the mountains every year for industrial use. To meet the development of the coal mining industry, a washing plant built with Polish assistance is also being built in the western suburbs.

By the "Kunming Lake"

On the road from Taiyuan City to the scenic Jinci, you can see a vast expanse of water on the bank of the Fen River from afar, which is the newly opened artificial lake. This lake is larger than Kunming Lake in Beijing and larger than the old Taiyuan city, and people call it "Taiyuan's Kunming Lake." In fact, this artificial lake serves a completely new industrial area – the eastern Hexi industrial area.

Looking west from this artificial lake, newly built factory buildings, office buildings, and dormitories stand facing the water and backed by the mountains. A thick pipeline runs south along the Tai-Fen Highway and enters the Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant. Near this large pipeline, there are also many small pipelines and crisscrossing power lines echoing each other. There are not as many chimneys here as in the northern suburbs, and not as much noise as in the western suburbs. This is a chemical industrial area. This industrial area, of course, also has other industries, such as the Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant, but it is mainly a chemical industry. There are the Taiyuan Chemical Plant, Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, and Taiyuan Pharmaceutical Plant. Adjacent to these three major chemical plants is the Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant. In Taiyuan, the chemical industry is not a new industry. As early as before liberation, there was the Shanxi Chemical Plant in the northern suburbs industrial area, but it can also be said to be a new industry. Because the chemical plant established during Yan Xishan's reactionary rule could only produce a few products such as oxygen and nitric acid, and the quantity was pitifully small. The Taiyuan Chemical Area is a comprehensive basic chemical industrial area, with a large scale and many varieties. Sulfuric acid, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, liquid chlorine, phenol, and many other products have already begun production.

Comprehensive Industrial Base

From the old urban area of Taiyuan to the new urban area, from the northern suburbs to the southern suburbs, from the western suburbs to the eastern suburbs, factories are scattered like stars. The city has 206 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, not including the street factories that were just built last year to serve large industries. According to statistics from relevant departments in Taiyuan City, there are at least more than 2,000 such factories. In terms of industrial sectors, among the 21 major industrial sectors, except for the petroleum, non-metallic minerals, and match industries, other industries such as electricity, fuel, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, metal processing, chemical, rubber, building materials, glass, wood, paper making, textiles, sewing, leather, food, cultural and educational art supplies, and ceramics have been formed. It is no exaggeration to call it a "comprehensive industrial city."

Comparing Taiyuan ten years ago with the newly born Taiyuan today, looking down on Taiyuan City from a high place, the old urban area occupies less than one-third of the area in this emerging industrial city. Narrow buildings have been submerged by tall and magnificent buildings. The total population of the city is more than 1.5 million, of which the number of employees is equivalent to the total population of Taiyuan before liberation. In terms of production, even if calculated according to the 1957 level, the city's production in 25 days of steel, 37 days of pig iron, 13 days of coal, 7 days of electricity, and more than 50 days of cement is equivalent to the annual output in the highest production year of the old Taiyuan. The Great Leap Forward of 1958, and the even Greater Leap Forward of 1959, are even more incomparable. (Attached picture)

The newly built Taiyuan Coal Washing Plant is under construction. After this plant is put into production, it can provide a large amount of refined coal for key iron and steel enterprises such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company.

    大跃进中的新基地
    本报记者  莎荫  银怀
    太原是在我国大规模经济建设中成长起来的城市。解放初期，这里仅有一座简陋的钢铁厂和几座机器修配厂。经过第一个五年计划的建设和去年的大跃进，已经是一座工厂林立、建筑雄伟的社会主义工业城市了。
    “七府坟”一瞥
    从绿荫如盖的五一路转胜利大街，向北走上横贯南北的解放大街，从这条街穿过太原旧工业区，就是七府坟车站。站在沥青马路的边沿，可以远眺建设中的七府坟车站全景。
    车站上堆积着待运的物资：圆形的水泥高压电杆、黑色的钢材、巨大的藏青色的重型行车，还有装了箱的机器、打了包的工业品。机车在吼叫、飞驰，人们在紧张地卸车、挂车，卡车不断地开出去，迎面满载物资的卡车又驶进来。
    火车鸣着清脆的笛声从这里驶出去，满载着钢铁、机械、化学制剂、农具、农药、纺织品、运往北京、武汉、三门峡、包头。这些列车向全国社会主义建设的大城市和农村驰去。
    七府坟车站是在1957年10月动工的。建成后它将是太原枢纽站中的一个编组站。现在太原的列车还在七府坟东南的太原北站编组。据太原铁路局太原办事处的郭剀同志谈，现在担负编组任务的太原北站，每天的列车吞吐量在一千七百四十辆左右。太原地区运输上最显著的变化是输出量大大增加了。1956年这个市各主要车站的运出量等于运入量的60％强，1957年运出量比运入量多了六十多万吨，比1956年增加了一倍以上，今年的变化将更大。也正是因为这个变化，太原北站已不能适应生产的要求了。七府坟编组站可望在今年年底移交，那时，运输条件就可以大大地改善了。
    北郊新貌
    出了“北门”，跨过铁路，一条宽阔平坦的柏油马路向北伸去，沿着这条路的两旁，厂房并竖，烟囱林立。马达、气笛、转动的车床、奔驰的列车、沸腾的钢炉中发出来的复杂的声音，传到几里路外。这种壮观，从旧城北门起，一直西行四十里左右，直达汾河的发源地的兰村，著名的太原钢铁公司就在北郊，现在太钢正进行着规模浩大的扩建工程。大于原来厂房几倍或十几倍的新厂房正在一幢幢竖起来，高大的房架上，远远就能看到闪着耀眼的电焊火光。新高炉像一个巨人样地耸入云霄。太原矿山机器厂经过改建和扩建，生产的矿山机械已分布在大西北的大戈壁到江南的丛山峻岭所有的地质勘探工地上。太原北郊是个旧工业区，从和平路往北，到处是新建的厂房、楼房。
    汾河西岸风光好
    从太原市交通的主轴线——迎泽大街西行，走过横跨汾河的迎泽大桥，就进入了河西工业区。这里和北郊工业区隔河相望、遥遥相对。
    河西工业区虽然有水泥、洗煤、纺织、煤炭等工业，但是主要是机械工业，著名的太原重型机器厂、晋西机器厂都建设在这里。
    太原重型机器厂的开工，曾经使全国人民为之欢欣鼓舞。现在，在方圆一千多亩土地上，三十个车间已经接近完工了。解放时，太原只有机械修配工业，而没有机械制造工业，在短短几年中，这里就建设了许多机械制造厂。太原重型机器厂的建设和投入生产，使太原的机械工业具备了一个比较完整的规模。太原不仅可以从太行仪表厂生产最小的制造手表的精密机器，和各种矿山机械、工作母机，发电机械，而且可以生产重型机械。去年大跃进以来，生产了大批新产品。不久前，又生产了七百六十米厘薄板轧钢机和二百七十吨行车。这些产品都非常庞大，一般的在六十万至一百万斤左右，大的甚至近千万斤。据这个厂的负责人计算，全厂全部投入生产后，一年的产品得装两千八百多个车皮才能拉走。
    从太原重型机器厂往西便是晋西机器厂。许多工作母机、冶金设备、发电机械正是在这个厂子里生产出来的。
    从太原重型机器厂往西便是太原的西山了。这是炼焦煤产地。太原西山煤矿加上东山煤矿每年要从山中开采六百万吨原煤供给工业使用，适应着煤矿工业的发展，波兰帮助我国建设的洗选厂，也在西郊建设起来。
    “昆明湖”畔
    在太原市区到名胜晋祠的路上，可以遥望见汾河河畔一片汪洋，那便是新开辟的人造湖。这个湖比北京的昆明湖还大，也比旧太原城大，人们称它为“太原的昆明湖”。其实这个人造湖是服务于一个完全新兴的工业区——河西东部工业区的。
    从这个人造湖西望，一幢幢新建的厂房、办公楼和宿舍，背山面水耸立着。一条粗大的管道顺着太汾公路南下，进了太原第一发电厂，在这条大管道的附近，还有许多小管道和纵横交错着的电线互相呼应。这里没有北郊那么多的烟囱，没有西郊那么大的响声。这里是化学工业区，这个工业区当然也有其它工业，如太原第一发电厂，但主要是化学工业。有太原化学厂、太原肥料厂、太原制药厂。毗邻这三大化工厂的是山西磷肥厂。在太原，化学工业不是一个新的行业，早在解放前，北郊工业区就有山西化学厂，但是也可以说是一种新的工业。因为阎锡山反动统治年代里建立的那个化学厂只能生产些氧气、硝酸等少数产品，而且数量也少的可怜，太原化工区是一个综合性的基本化学工业区，规模大、品种多，硫酸、烧碱、盐酸、液氯、苯酚以及其他许许多多产品，都已开始生产。
    综合性的工业基地
    从太原旧城区到新市区、从北郊到南郊、从西郊到东郊，工厂星罗棋布。全市的国营和地方国营厂矿就有二百零六个，这还不包括去年刚建成的为大工业服务的街道工厂。据太原市有关部门统计，这种厂至少有二千多个。以工业的行业计算，二十一个主要工业行业中，除石油、非金属矿和火柴工业而外，其他电、燃料、黑色金属、有色金属、金属加工、化学、橡胶、建筑材料、玻璃、木材、造纸、纺织、缝纫、皮革、食品、文教艺术用品、陶瓷等行业都已形成，人们称它是“综合性的工业城市”毫不过分。
    把十年前的太原和今天新生的太原相比，站在高处俯视太原城，旧城区在这个新兴的工业城市中占着不到三分之一的面积。狭小的建筑物被高大宏伟的建筑物淹没了。全市人口总数是一百五十多万人，其中职工人数就相当于太原解放前的人口总数。在生产上，就按1957年的水平计算，这个城二十五天生产的钢、三十七天的生铁、十三天的煤、七天的电、五十多天的水泥就等于旧太原生产最高年份一年的生产量。大跃进的1958年，更大跃进的1959年，那就更不可比了。（附图片）
