Flood Prevention and Resistance to Ensure a Bumper Harvest
Fujian, Hubei, Zhejiang and Other Places Conscientiously Prepare Organizationally and Materially

    (Our report) Fuzhou - In recent days, inland areas of Fujian have generally experienced heavy and torrential rain. In Chong'an and Pucheng in northern Fujian and Shanghang and Changting in western Fujian, torrential rainfall has reached more than 160 millimeters, and flash floods have occurred in some areas. However, thanks to preparations made in advance, these areas quickly overcame the floods. Chong'an, Jianyang, Pucheng, and other counties reported rainfall and water conditions to each other upstream and downstream, strengthened cooperation, and promptly moved people in areas vulnerable to flash floods to safe locations. At the same time, they organized forces to harvest wheat, repair water conservancy, protect granaries, and salvage sunken wood, thereby greatly reducing losses. Each commune in Chong'an County organized flood prevention teams and flood-fighting shock brigades to carry out flood resistance. The Satellite Commune in this county also organized a professional team of more than 200 people to comprehensively inspect the commune's water conservancy facilities, large and small, and widened and extended the drainage ditches in the fields, effectively preventing flash floods.
    In the coastal Longxi, Jinjiang, and Fu'an prefectures, effective measures have been taken to improve organizations at all levels and strengthen flood prevention and flood control leadership. Each commune has also organized patrols and rescue teams according to the needs of emergency rescue, and is rushing to repair river and sea dikes and water conservancy projects.
    Larger reservoirs that have been completed or are under construction throughout the province, as well as infrastructure construction sites such as the Gutianxi Hydropower Station, have established flood prevention and emergency rescue organizations and prepared a large number of flood control materials.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 28th - It is currently the flood season for rivers in the south. Flood control command organizations from the province to the county level in Hubei Province have been established one after another. Some counties in the Jingzhou and Xiaogan prefectures have organized flood control teams early to prepare to go to the dikes at any time to fight the floods.
    Hubei Province attaches great importance to flood control work this year. In early May, the province convened a provincial flood control conference to deploy and arrange flood control work. Subsequently, various localities organized inspection teams to conduct a major pre-flood inspection of the critical dike sections along the Yangtze River and Han River and major reservoir projects. Xiangyang Prefecture, located in the middle reaches of the Han River, reinforced and strengthened the dike sections found to have potential hazards during the inspection to improve their flood resistance capacity. Various localities have also actively rushed to produce and transport flood control materials such as grass bags and earth strips, in accordance with the principle of "relying on the masses and using local materials," for emergency use.
    (Our report) Hangzhou, May 29th - Since the 4th of this month, continuous overcast and rainy weather has prevailed in various parts of Zhejiang Province. The floodwaters of some rivers have successively exceeded the warning water level. The summer flood season, in which we are in tense combat with natural disasters, has arrived. Therefore, flood control work has been rapidly launched in various parts of Zhejiang. Flood control and drought relief headquarters have been established in all four prefectures and fifty-one counties and cities throughout the province, with designated personnel in charge. Seventy percent of the people's communes throughout the province have established flood control headquarters. The Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Jinhua local committees have specifically convened flood control and drought relief meetings. The Jiaxing local committee required all counties to prepare for this year's flood control and drought relief work based on the standards of the 1954 flood, the 1956 flood, and the 1958 drought, and to rank and assess the existing water conservancy facilities and farmland disaster resistance capabilities, and adopt different measures for different situations. The Wenzhou local committee has instructed all counties to carry out mass engineering inspections. Large reservoirs in Jinhua Prefecture with a water storage capacity of more than 50 million cubic meters have been designated to establish separate flood control headquarters to strengthen management. Reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 5 million cubic meters are the responsibility of county committee members, while reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 500,000 cubic meters are the responsibility of commune party committee members and management district general branch committee members. Reservoirs with a water storage capacity of less than 500,000 cubic meters are the responsibility of production teams.
    While Zhejiang Province is carrying out water conservancy project inspections and emergency repairs, it is mobilizing the masses to rush to prevent floods and drain waterlogged areas, and rush to harvest spring crops. Jinhua Prefecture mobilized more than 200,000 people to participate in the battle to rush to harvest spring crops along the rivers and in low-lying areas. County and commune cadres in Shaoxing County organized more than 80,000 commune members to rescue submerged rapeseed and early rice fields. The Xiaoshi Commune in Anji County organized a flood control army of more than 8,000 people to drain the water from more than 13,800 mu of submerged spring crops and more than 12,000 mu of rice fields, and repaired 32 medium-sized reservoir spillways. More than 1,800 dangerous projects and hidden danger projects have been repaired throughout the province after inspection. (Wu Zhaoxiang)

    防汛抗洪　确保丰收
    福建湖北浙江等地切切实实做好组织准备和物资准备
    本报讯　连日来，福建内陆地区普遍出现大雨和暴雨。闽北的崇安、浦城和闽西的上杭、长汀等地，暴雨量曾达一百六十多公厘，部分地区山洪暴发。但是由于各地事前做好了准备，迅速战胜了洪灾。崇安、建阳、浦城等县上下游互报雨情、水情，加强协作，及时使易受山洪袭击地区的群众转移到安全地区；同时组织力量，抢收小麦，抢修水利，保护粮仓，打捞沉木，因而大大减少了损失。崇安县各公社都组织了防汛小组与防洪突击队，进行抗洪斗争。这个县的卫星公社，还组织了二百多人的专业队，全面检查公社大小水利，并把山田的排洪沟加宽延长，有效地防止了山洪。
    在沿海的龙溪、晋江和福安专区，日来都采取有效措施，层层健全机构，加强防洪防汛领导。各公社还根据抢险需要，组织了巡逻队、抢险队，并突击抢修江海堤防和水利工程。
    全省已完工或正在施工的较大的水库，以及古田溪水电站等基建工地，都已建立了防洪防汛及抢险组织，并准备好大批防汛器材。
    新华社武汉28日电　目前正是南方江、河涨水季节。湖北省从省到县的防汛指挥机构已经先后建立。荆州、孝感专区有些县提早组织防汛队伍，准备随时上堤跟洪水斗争。
    今年湖北省对防汛工作很重视。5月初就召开了全省防汛会议，部署和安排防汛工作。接着，各地又组织了检查组，对长江、汉水两岸的险要堤段和较大的水库工程，进行了汛前大检查。地处汉水中游的襄阳专区，在检查中发现有隐患的堤段，就培修加固，提高抗洪能力。各地还根据“依靠群众，就地取材”的原则，积极赶制和调运草包、土篾等防汛器材，备抢险用。
    本报杭州29日电　浙江省各地自本月4日起，阴雨连绵，部分河流洪水已先后突破警戒水位，与自然灾害紧张搏斗的夏汛季节已经来到。因此浙江各地防汛工作已迅速开展，全省四个专区、五十一个县市已全部成立防汛防旱指挥部，确定专人负责。全省70％的人民公社成立了防汛指挥所。嘉兴、温州、宁波、金华等地委专门召开了防汛防旱会议。嘉兴地委要求各县以1954年的涝、1956年的洪、1958年的旱为标准来做好今年的防汛防旱工作，对现有的水利设施和农田抗灾能力进行排队摸底，针对不同情况，采取不同措施。温州地委已指示各县开展群众性的工程大检查。金华专区蓄水五千万方以上的大型水库，都确定单独成立防汛指挥部，加强管理，凡蓄水五百万方以上的水库，由县委委员分工包干负责。蓄水五百万方以下到五十万方以上的水库，分别由公社党委委员，管理区总支委员分工包干负责，蓄水五十万方以下的水库由生产队包干负责。
    浙江全省各地在紧张地进行水利工程检查、抢修的同时，发动群众突击防洪排涝，抢收春花。金华专区发动二十多万人投入了抢收沿江和低洼地区春花的战斗。绍兴县的县、社干部组织八万多社员，抢救了受淹的油菜和早稻田。安吉县晓墅公社组织八千多人的防洪大军，排除被淹的一万三千八百多亩春花和一万二千多亩稻田的积水，抢修好三十二处中型水库的溢洪道。全省经过检查已抢修好险工隐患工程一千八百多处。　（吴兆祥）
