Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th - TASS dispatch: Surkov, First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, delivered a report at the Third Soviet Writers' Congress on the 18th, entitled "The Tasks of Soviet Literature in Communist Construction."

In his report, Surkov said that since the Second Congress of Soviet Writers in 1954, the number of literary works published in the Soviet Union has increased by more than half, while the number of copies issued has increased by about three-quarters.

The works of writers from fraternal ethnic groups have grown particularly rapidly. The works of new writers occupy a prominent place in the literary works published in these four years.

Surkov believes that the main responsibilities of writers are: to describe the great achievements of the people and to actively promote communist ideology.

He said that reflecting the requirements of modern life is an extremely important political, artistic, and aesthetic requirement. Correctly elucidating this requirement will raise Soviet literature to new ideological and artistic heights.

Surkov said that the Communist Party requires writers to conduct extensive and in-depth artistic investigations of the lives of the people, and to use artistic images to reveal the complex process of the formation of the character of people building a communist society.

He emphasized that the battle banner of Soviet writers is socialist realism, which summarizes the entire creative practice, and under this banner they are moving towards new ideological and artistic peaks.

He said that the malicious attacks on the Soviet creative method and Lenin's principle of the Party spirit of literature by the loyal lackeys of reactionary bourgeois theory and their revisionist echoers have been crushed. The enemies of socialist aesthetics have been defeated.

When talking about some of the most pressing issues related to socialist realism that must continue to be studied, Surkov raised questions about the classical traditions, innovation, and artistic techniques of Soviet literature, about the diversity of art, the shaping of positive characters, and the issue of writers' creative individuality.

Surkov pointed out that the creative discussions among Soviet writers have been fruitful. He said that most of those who had made erroneous statements or distorted reality in their works have recognized their past mistakes and expressed their willingness to avoid these mistakes in future literary activities.

The reporter pointed out the significant achievements made by writers in socialist countries in the past four years. They have grown and flourished year after year, constantly producing new, immortal, and valuable works, showing a rich and diverse national form.

Surkov pointed out that with the development of literature in these countries, a great deal of work has been done in translating and introducing each other's works. In the past four years, 1,768 works by writers from socialist countries have been translated and introduced in more than 60 languages of various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, with a total circulation of over 170 million copies.

The reporter pointed out that it is gratifying that in capitalist countries, more and more writers are now taking a progressive stand in their creative practice. It is these writers who inherit and further develop the people-oriented and realistic traditions in their national literature, and stand in opposition to the decadent tendencies in modern bourgeois art.

Surkov said that Soviet literature, full of internationalist spirit, is full of confidence in the future.

Surkov exposed the conspiracy of the witches of reactionary literature to slander Soviet writers with "obeying orders." They deceptively change concepts because what they slander is the natural organic connection between Soviet literature and the people and the infinite loyalty of Soviet literature to socialist ideology.

Surkov said that it is ridiculous to hear the reactionary writers hired by the reactionary factions talking nonsense about the lack of creative freedom in the Soviet Union.

Surkov emphasized that the imperialist reactionaries, with the support of international revisionism, frantically attempted to "refute" the fundamental principles of Soviet literature, and this attempt has been met with inevitable and disgraceful failure. The literature of the free socialist world is growing, consolidating, and creating new artistic wealth.

Surkov finally said that in order to fight against reactionary forces, to eliminate the threat of war, and for humanity, we Soviet writers will forever extend the hand of friendship to all those who care about the fate of mankind and are fighting for peace among people, to all those who yearn for and believe in the happiness and prosperity of mankind.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th - The delegates to the Third Soviet Writers' Congress held discussions on Surkov's report on the first day of the meeting on the 18th. During the discussion, five writer representatives, including Gonchar and Panferov, spoke, and Mao Dun, the head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th - Mao Dun, head of the Chinese delegation invited to attend the Third Soviet Writers' Congress, delivered a congratulatory speech at the congress on the 18th on behalf of the Chinese Writers Association and all Chinese writers.

Mao Dun first extended warm fraternal congratulations to the congress on behalf of the Chinese Writers Delegation.

He said that in the short four years since the Second Soviet Writers' Congress, Soviet literature has profoundly reflected the creative labor and heroic struggles of the Soviet people in building a communist society. It has played an increasingly active role in cultivating new people, helping new things grow, and strengthening the moral and political unity of Soviet society. It has made tremendous contributions to opposing colonialism, opposing the Cold War, safeguarding world peace, and strengthening friendship between people of all countries. It can be said without exaggeration that Soviet literature, with great ideological feelings and rich experience, is advancing towards new peaks of world artistic creation.

Soviet literature strongly and deeply moves the hearts of Chinese readers, wins their sincere admiration, and inspires their fighting spirit. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, 81.965 million copies of Soviet literary works have been printed in China. This is not accidental because Soviet literature is a literature that contributes all its creations to the proletarian revolution and socialist construction. It faithfully reflects the glorious revolutionary road that the Soviet people have traveled for more than 40 years with great artistic power. People can find the spiritual power to liberate their countries and nations and build their new lives from here. Precisely because of this, we Chinese people have extremely deep feelings for Soviet literature and regard it as a good teacher and helpful friend.

Mao Dun pointed out: In fact, the influence of Soviet literature has spread to every corner of the world. Progressive humanity all over the world is increasingly admiring Soviet literature.

Mao Dun pointed out that in recent years, Western reactionary bourgeois writers, modern revisionists, and traitors to the world proletarian cause have constantly used every opportunity to attack Soviet literature. Yugoslav revisionists have played an extremely shameful and pathetic role in this. The reason why these reactionaries and traitors do this is precisely because they fear the revolutionary influence of Soviet literature around the world. He said, however, that the brilliance of truth can never be covered by mist-like lies. Soviet literature, with socialist realism as its creative principle, has never concealed its inseparable connection with the proletarian cause from the very beginning. From the very beginning, it has taken on the glorious mission of promoting the victory of the proletarian cause and accelerating the death of capitalism. It never hopes to receive any praise from the bourgeois reactionaries and their echoers. The enemy's attempt has been completely defeated, and Soviet literature still stands firm like a peak.

He said that socialist realism is the basic method of international proletarian literature. From its founder, the great Gorky, all of us writers who are loyal to the communist ideals and loyal to the people's cause have always unswervingly followed this path and are moving forward with confidence. Strive to achieve the great goal of communism.

Mao Dun pointed out that the literature of socialist countries is thriving like the rising sun and becoming more and more vibrant. The literature that is booming in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reflecting the people's national revolutionary struggles, is also full of spirit and fighting spirit. However, the bourgeois literature in capitalist countries is undergoing a process of degeneration and decay and is becoming more and more outrageous. However, progressive and just writers in these countries are carrying out heroic struggles against bourgeois reactionary writers for the benefit of their own people and for the benefit of world peace.

Mao Dun said that Soviet literature is the core of the world's progressive literary movement. In the historical development of more than 40 years, Soviet literature has created valuable wealth and accumulated rich experience in artistic creation for world progressive literature. As Comrade Khrushchev profoundly clarified in his historic document "Literature and Art Must Maintain Close Ties with the Life of the People," the source of the powerful force of Soviet literature lies in its close connection with the people. The life of the people is the only inexhaustible source of literature and art. Soviet literature, rooted in this most fertile soil of people's lives, will inevitably have lush green leaves, bright flowers, and abundant fruits. Chinese writers have always taken this as their own direction of efforts.

Mao Dun said that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward new, greater, and more glorious tasks for Soviet literature. We believe that the Third Soviet Writers' Congress will be able to comprehensively summarize the achievements and experiences of Soviet literature, further strengthen the connection between writers and people's lives, reflect the heroic feats of the great Soviet people—the builders of communism—with superb artistic skills, and display the great changes experienced by the Soviet people, pushing Soviet literature to a new peak of prosperity and development, and making greater contributions to the progressive cause of mankind in the world.

    苏尔科夫在苏联作家代表大会上论作家职责
    描述人民伟绩  宣传共产主义
    茅盾致祝词指出苏联文学鼓舞中国人民的斗志
    新华社19日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联作家协会理事会第一书记苏尔科夫18日在苏联第三次作家代表大会上作了“苏联文学在共产主义建设中的任务”的报告。
    苏尔科夫在报告中说，自1954年第二次代表大会以来，苏联所出版的文学作品的数目增加了一半以上，而发行数则增加了四分之三左右。
    增长得特别快的是兄弟民族作家的作品。这四年出版的文学著作中，新作家的作品占有显著地位。
    苏尔科夫认为，作家的主要职责是：描述人民的伟大业绩，积极宣传共产主义思想。
    他说，反映现代生活的要求是极重要的政治的、艺术的、美学的要求。正确地阐明这种要求，将把苏联文学提到新的思想高度和艺术高度。
    苏尔科夫说，共产党要求作家对人民的生活作广泛深入的艺术考察，用艺术形象揭示建设共产主义社会的人的性格形成的复杂过程。
    他强调指出，苏联作家的战斗旗帜是总结了整个创作实践的社会主义现实主义，他们在这个旗帜下走向新的思想和艺术的高峰。
    他说，反动资产阶级理论的忠实奴仆和他们的修正主义应声虫对苏联的创作方法和列宁的文学的党性原则所作的恶毒攻击已经被粉碎。社会主义美学的敌人已经遭到了失败。
    在谈到有关社会主义现实主义的一些最迫切的、必须继续加以研究的问题时，苏尔科夫提出了有关苏联文学的古典传统、革新和艺术技巧的问题，有关艺术的多样性、正面人物的塑造、作家的创作个性问题等。
    苏尔科夫指出，苏联作家们关于创造性的讨论是有成果的。他说，曾经发表过错误言论或者在作品中歪曲现实的人，大多数已经认识到了自己过去的错误，并表示愿意在今后的文学活动中避免这些错误。
    报告人指出了社会主义各国文学家近四年来所获得的显著成就。他们一年年地成长、茁壮起来，不断拿出新的、不朽的、有价值的作品来，显示出丰富多采的民族形式。
    苏尔科夫指出，随着这些国家文学的发展，在互相翻译介绍彼此的作品方面作了大量工作。近四年来，用六十多种苏联各族人民的语言翻译介绍了各社会主义国家作家的一千七百六十八种著作，总发行量超过一亿七千万册。
    报告人指出，令人欣喜的是，在资本主义国家，现在也有越来越多的作家在自己的创作实践中站到进步的立场上来了。正是这些作家继承并进一步发展了本国文学中的人民性和现实主义的传统，而与现代资产阶级艺术中的颓废倾向相对立。
    苏尔科夫说，充满国际主义精神的苏联文学对未来满怀信心。
    苏尔科夫揭露了反动文学的巫婆们以“遵命主义”来诬蔑苏联作家的阴谋。他们欺世惑众地偷换概念，因为他们所诬蔑的是苏联文学同人民的天然的有机联系和苏联文学对社会主义思想的无限忠诚。
    苏尔科夫说，反动派御用的文人们瞎说什么苏联没有创作自由，听到这种假慈悲的鬼话，不得不令人感到可笑。
    苏尔科夫强调指出帝国主义反动派在国际修正主义的支持下猖狂地企图“驳倒”苏联文学的根本原则，这个企图已经遭到了必然的、可耻的失败。自由的社会主义世界的文学正在成长、巩固和创造着新的艺术财富。
    苏尔科夫最后说，为了同反动势力进行斗争，为了消灭战争威胁，为了人道，我们苏联的作家永远把友谊的手伸向所有的关心着人类命运、并为人民之间的和平而斗争着的人们，伸向所有的热望、深信人类的幸福和繁荣的人们。
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联第三次作家代表大会的代表们在18日的第一天会议上，就苏尔科夫的报告进行了讨论。在讨论中，有冈查尔、潘费罗夫等五位作家代表发了言，中国代表团团长茅盾在会上致祝词。
    新华社莫斯科18日电　应邀出席苏联第三次作家代表大会的中国代表团团长茅盾18日代表中国作家协会和全体中国作家在大会上致祝词。
    茅盾首先代表中国作家代表团向大会致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    他说，从第二次苏联作家代表大会以来短短四年多的时间里，苏联文学给苏联人民建设共产主义社会的创造性劳动和英勇斗争以深刻的反映，它在培养新人、帮助新事物成长和加强苏维埃社会的道德、政治的团结一致上面，起了越来越积极的作用。它对反对殖民主义、反对冷战、保卫世界和平、加强各国人民之间的友谊等等，作出了巨大的贡献。可以毫不夸大地说，具有伟大的思想感情和丰富经验的苏联文学正在向世界艺术创作的新的高峰前进。
    苏联文学强烈而深刻地激动着中国读者的心，赢得他们衷心的敬仰，鼓舞他们的斗志。从中华人民共和国建立以来，苏联文学作品已在中国印行了八千一百九十六万五千册，这不是偶然的，因为，苏联文学是把自己的一切创造都贡献给无产阶级革命和社会主义建设的文学，它以巨大的艺术力量忠实地反映了苏联人民四十多年来走过的光辉的革命道路。人们从这里可以找到解放自己的国家和民族，建设自己的新生活的精神力量。正因为如此，我们中国人民对苏联文学有着极为深厚的感情，把它当做良师益友。
    茅盾指出：实际上，苏联的文学的影响已经遍及世界上的各个角落。全世界的进步人类都在越来越强烈地爱戴苏联文学。
    茅盾指出，近几年来，西方反动的资产阶级作家，现代修正主义分子和世界无产阶级事业的叛徒们不断地利用一切机会向苏联文学进攻。南斯拉夫的修正主义者们在当中扮演了极其可耻又可悲的角色。这些反动派和叛徒们之所以如此，正是由于他们惧怕苏联文学在全世界的这种革命影响。他说，但是，真理的光辉决不是迷雾般的谎言所能掩盖的。以社会主义现实主义为它的创作原则的苏联文学，一开始就毫不隐讳地公开宣布自己和无产阶级事业的不可分割的联系，一开始就把促进无产阶级事业的胜利和加速资本主义的死亡的光荣使命担当起来，它从来不希望从资产阶级反动派和他们的应声虫那里得到任何赞誉。敌人的企图已经遭到彻底失败，而苏联文学则依然像高峰一般屹立不动。
    他说，社会主义现实主义是国际无产阶级文学基本的方法。从它的奠基者伟大的高尔基起，我们一切忠实于共产主义理想、忠实于人民事业的作家们始终不渝地沿着这条道路走了过来，并且充满信心地向前走去。为实现共产主义的伟大目标而奋斗。
    茅盾指出，社会主义国家的文学正像旭日东升似地欣欣向荣，越来越富有生命力。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲蓬蓬勃勃的、反映人民的民族主义革命斗争的文学，也是意气昂扬、斗志旺盛。而在资本主义各国的资产阶级文学，却正经历着堕落和腐烂的过程，越来越不像话。但是，这些国家中的进步的，富有正义感的作家，却正是为了他们本国人民的利益和世界和平的利益和资产阶级的反动作家进行着英勇的斗争。
    茅盾说，苏联文学是全世界进步文学运动的核心，在四十多年的历史发展中，苏联文学为世界进步文学创造了珍贵的财富，积累了丰富的艺术创造的经验。正如赫鲁晓夫同志在他的历史性的文件“文学艺术要同人民生活保持密切的联系”中深刻阐明的，苏联文学的强大力量的源泉在于它和人民的紧密联系。人民生活是文学艺术取之不尽用之不竭的唯一源泉。植根于人民生活的这一最肥沃土壤上的苏联文学，必然绿叶成荫，花朵艳丽，果实硕美。中国作家也一向以此作为自己的努力方向。
    茅盾说，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会向苏联文学提出了新的更巨大而光荣的任务。我们相信，苏联第三次作家代表大会一定能够全面地总结苏联文学的成就和经验，进一步加强作家与人民生活的联系，以高超的艺术技巧来反映伟大的苏联人民——共产主义建设者的英雄功勋，展示苏联人民所经历的伟大变革，把苏联文学推向一个新的繁荣发展的顶峰，为世界人类的进步事业做出更伟大的贡献。（附图片）
