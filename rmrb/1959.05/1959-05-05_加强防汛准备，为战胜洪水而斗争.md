Strengthen Flood Prevention Preparations and Fight to Conquer Floods

    The rainy season has arrived and the flood season is approaching. Strengthening flood prevention preparations and fighting to conquer floods, this extremely important and arduous task, has been put on the agenda. Doing a good job in flood prevention is an important measure to ensure a greater agricultural harvest, protect industrial bases, transportation, and the safety of people's lives and property. We must not be negligent or treat it lightly.

    This year's flood prevention work has more favorable conditions than in any previous year. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, under the guidance of the central government's water management policy of "emphasizing storage, small-scale projects, and self-reliance by the masses," a massive water conservancy construction movement has been launched across the country, and a large number of water conservancy projects have been completed. Last year, the country completed 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, expanded irrigation area by 480 million mu, initially controlled waterlogging area of 210 million mu, and controlled soil erosion area of 320,000 square kilometers. Together with water conservancy projects over the years, this has greatly strengthened our country's ability to manage water and prevent floods, reduced drought and flood disasters last year, and ensured a great agricultural harvest last year. Water conservancy projects are still under construction this year, and many projects will play a role in flood control during the flood season. In addition, the rich experience accumulated in flood prevention struggles over the years, the unprecedented improvement of the masses' political consciousness and organizational strength after the people's communes, these conditions can play a greater role in the flood prevention struggle.

    At present, the first thing to pay attention to is to overcome the thought of paralysis and complacency. Some comrades believe that many water conservancy projects were built last year; the flood prevention problem is not significant this year; there have been no major floods in the past few years, and there may not be any this year; and that we overcame the extraordinary floods of the Yellow River and Han River last year, and they will not happen again this year; especially in areas that were relatively dry in previous years, many comrades do not pay attention to flood prevention. These thoughts are of course harmful. It is true that great achievements have been made in water conservancy construction in the past few years, especially last year. However, among the large number of completed projects, including embankments, most have not been tested by floods. Some projects have not been fully inspected and repaired. Some newly built small reservoirs have not been equipped with spillways or the spillway standards are too low. Some projects, although the main structure such as earth dams have been completed, have not been finally completed, and the role of the projects cannot be fully utilized. In addition, flood prevention materials or drainage tools are not adequately prepared in some areas, and so on. This shows that this year's flood prevention task is still very arduous, and we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against floods. The current battle slogan is: Eliminate paralysis and complacency, and strive to do all kinds of flood prevention preparation work.

    Thinking of the worst and striving for the best is the guideline we should follow in doing all our work, and it is also the fundamental guideline for doing a good job in flood prevention. In order to ensure the victorious completion of this year's flood prevention task, all localities should organize forces to conduct a thorough inspection of flood prevention projects immediately, and solve problems as soon as they are discovered. There should be measures to defend against extraordinary floods in the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and other rivers. New construction projects that do not meet flood prevention standards should be improved immediately. For unfinished projects, we should, according to needs and possibilities, resolutely complete those that can be completed before the flood season by seizing the time; for projects that cannot be completed before the flood season, we should take measures to safely pass the flood season. Some temporary river dams built for drought resistance must be dismantled before the flood season. Soil and water conservation projects that were damaged last year should also be repaired. Flood prevention and rescue materials should also be thoroughly inspected, and under the principle of self-reliance and local materials, they should be fully prepared. Materials that were misappropriated last year should be recovered if possible, and damaged drainage tools should be repaired. Flood prevention agencies in various places should resume office immediately, and grassroots flood prevention organizations should also be established immediately.

    The joint operation of water conservancy projects such as reservoirs, canals, ponds, and weirs is a very important condition for achieving greater success in this year's flood prevention. All localities should combine large, medium, and small projects within the basin or region as closely as possible to form a drainage and irrigation system that is conducive to water storage and drainage as well as irrigation. It is necessary to implement the policy of "emphasizing storage, storing for use," and, under the principle of ensuring project safety, store as much water as possible, reserve water resources, combine flood prevention and drought resistance, and give full play to the role of the projects. It is necessary to prevent prematurely releasing water stored in the reservoir, resulting in a lack of water sources and affecting production; it is also necessary to prevent the reservoir from storing too much water, which may cause the project to collapse and cause disasters when a large flood comes. To accurately grasp the timing of storage and release, we must greatly strengthen hydrological forecasting work. All localities should make early arrangements for rain gauge stations, flood reporting tools, and hydrological workers.

    According to meteorological forecasts, this year's flood season tends to come early. The rainy season in the south has started earlier, and the flood season is about to begin. The flood season in the north is not far away. Time is pressing, and we must make all preparations for flood prevention as early as possible to ensure victory in flood prevention, so as to protect this year's great agricultural harvest and the Great Leap Forward.

### 加强防汛准备，为战胜洪水而斗争

    加强防汛准备，为战胜洪水而斗争
    雨季已到，汛期即将来临，加强防汛准备，为战胜洪水而斗争，这一十分重要而艰巨的工作，已经提到议事日程上来了。作好防汛工作，是保证农业更大丰收，保护工业基地、交通运输和人民生命财产安全的重要措施，绝对不能疏忽大意，等闲视之。
    今年的防汛工作，比过去任何一年都有着更有利的条件。解放以来，特别是去年大跃进以来，在中央的“以蓄为主，小型为主，群众自办为主”的治水方针指导下，全国开展了巨大的水利建设运动，完成了大量的水利工程建设。去年全国完成了土石方工程量五百八十亿公方，扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，初步治理洼涝面积二亿一千万亩，控制水土流失面积三十二万平方公里，加上历年来的水利工程，大大加强了我国治水防洪的能力，减轻了去年的旱涝灾害，保证了去年农业的大丰收。今年水利工程仍在继续兴建，有不少的工程，在汛期内即能起拦洪作用。此外历年来在防汛斗争中积累的丰富经验、人民公社化后群众的政治觉悟和组织力量的空前提高，这些条件，在防汛斗争都可发挥更大的作用。
    目前首先需要注意的，是要克服麻痹自满的思想。有些同志认为，去年作了许多水利工程；今年防汛问题不大了，过去几年没有大水，今年也不一定会有；去年已战胜了黄河、汉江特大洪水，今年不会重来；尤其是往年较干旱的地区，许多同志都不重视防汛。这些思想当然是有害的。过去几年特别是去年水利建设有很大成就，这是事实。但是，在已成的大量工程中包括堤防在内，基本上还没有经过洪水的考验。有些工程还没有经过全面检查和修补。有些新建小水库还没有设置溢洪道或溢洪道标准偏低。也有的工程虽然主体工程如土坝完成了，但并没有最后竣工，工程作用还不能得到充分发挥。加上防汛器材或排水工具有些地区还准备不足等等。这就说明今年的防汛任务还很艰巨，对于洪水还必须经常保持高度的警惕性。当前的战斗口号是：清除麻痹思想，努力做好各种防汛的准备工作。
    从最坏处着想，向最好方向努力，是我们作好一切工作应该遵循的方针，也是作好防汛工作的根本方针。为了保证胜利地完成今年的防汛任务，各地应该组织力量立即对防汛工程进行一次严密的检查，发现问题就马上解决。对长江、黄河以及其它河流都应有防御特大洪水的措施。对于不合防洪标准的新建工程，应立即进行改善。对于未完成工程，应当根据需要与可能，凡是在汛前可以完成的工程，要抓紧施工坚决完成；在汛前不能完成的工程，应该作好安渡汛期的措施。有些为抗旱筑起的临时性的拦河坝，汛前一定要拆除。水土保持工程在去年被冲坏的，也应该修好。防汛抢险器材也应该彻底检查，并在自力更生、就地取材原则下，准备充分，去年被挪用的物料可以收回的应该收回，排水工具被损坏了的应该修好。各地的防汛机构应该立即恢复办公，基层防汛组织也应该立即建立起来。
    水库、渠道、塘、堰等项水利工程联合运用，是取得今年防汛更大胜利的一个很重要的条件。各地要把流域内或地区内大、中、小工程尽可能密切结合起来，形成既利于蓄水、排水又利于灌溉的排灌系统。要贯彻执行“以蓄为主，蓄而为用”的方针，在保证工程安全的原则下，尽量多蓄水，储备水利资源，使防汛与抗旱相结合，充分发挥工程作用。要防止过早地将水库中的蓄水放掉，结果缺少水源，影响生产；也要防止水库蓄水过满，当大水来时冲倒工程，造成灾害。要作到准确掌握蓄、放时机，就要大大加强水文预报工作，各地对于雨量站、报汛工具及水文工作人员要早作安排。
    根据气象预报，今年汛期有早来趋势，南方雨季已提前，即将出现进入汛期，北方距汛期也已不远。时间紧迫，必须及早作好防汛的一切准备工作，保证防汛胜利，以保卫今年农业的大丰收、大跃进。
