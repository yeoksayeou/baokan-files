    Cheers for Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion
    ——Watching the Documentary Film “Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion”
    Yang Tianxi
    The Tibetan rebellion has been basically quelled! The good news is truly heartening. Just as people were rejoicing, seeing the documentary film “Quelling the Tibetan Rebellion” was even more exciting.
    This documentary mainly records the course of the Tibetan rebellion, and it uses ironclad facts to illustrate the truth of the Tibetan rebellion. On the screen, we saw a group of thieving and ghostly rebels posting rebellious "conscription orders" and other reactionary proclamations on the streets. We saw rebels building bunkers everywhere, digging trenches, and digging gun emplacements, even around the Norbulingka, where the Dalai Lama lived. We saw rebels burning and killing everywhere, even many civilian houses were looted, and many mosques were left in ruins. A Tibetan youth who reported the rebels' situation to the People's Liberation Army had his eyes gouged out by the rebels. …
    The truth of the Tibetan rebellion has long been revealed. This documentary truthfully records the course of the rebellion. Those who still do not understand, or do not fully understand the truth, can learn many lessons from it.
    This documentary is very well made, concise and clear. I think the reason why this documentary is concise and clear is because the filmmakers grasped several core issues in the course of quelling the Tibetan rebellion, such as who was the instigator of the Tibetan rebellion, who fired the first shot; whether the Dalai Lama was kidnapped; who destroyed religion... Moreover, in explaining these issues, it is very layered and concise. For example, regarding the three letters written by the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan, the film vividly portrays the different situations in which each letter was written. This is much more moving than filming three letters in a row and using narration to explain the reasons and development of these letters. Since the focus of the film is to record the course of quelling the Tibetan rebellion, the film only uses a few scenes at the beginning to explain the general situation of Tibet, and only uses a few scenes at the end to explain the peaceful scene after the rebellion was quelled, which makes the center stand out and leaves a deep impression on people.

    欢呼平息西藏叛乱
    ——看电影纪录片“平息西藏叛乱”
    杨天喜
    西藏叛乱已经基本上平息了！喜讯传来，真是人心大快。正当人们欢欣鼓舞的时候，看到了纪录片“平息西藏叛乱”，更是兴奋百倍。
    这部纪录片主要是纪录西藏叛乱经过，它以铁一般的事实说明了西藏叛乱的真相。我们在银幕上看到一批贼头鬼脑的叛匪在街头张贴叛乱的“征兵令”和其他反动文告。我们看到叛匪到处筑地堡、挖战壕、挖枪眼，连达赖喇嘛居住的罗布林卡周围也不例外。我们看到叛匪到处焚毁、杀戮，连许多民房也被抢劫一空，许多清真寺片瓦不留，一个向解放军报告叛匪情况的藏族青年被叛匪挖去了双眼。……
    西藏叛乱的真相，早已经水落石出，这部纪录片又把叛乱经过如实纪录下来，对那些至今还不明白，或不完全明白真相的人，是可以从中得到许多教训的。
    这部纪录片拍得很好，简洁、鲜明。这部纪录片所以简洁、鲜明，我觉得，是因为摄制人员抓紧了西藏平叛经过中的几个核心问题，如西藏叛乱的肇祸者是谁，谁打第一枪；达赖喇嘛是否被劫持；谁破坏宗教……。而且在阐述这些问题时，很有层次、很简练。如关于达赖喇嘛亲笔写给谭冠三将军的三封信，影片把每封信所处的不同的情况都形象地表现出来，这比一连拍三封信，同时用解说词来表现这些信写成的原因及其发展，就更动人得多。由于影片的中心是纪录平息西藏叛乱的经过，影片开头只用几个画面交代西藏概况，结尾只用几个画面交代叛乱平定后的一派和平景象，就使得中心突出，给人留下深刻的印象。
