The Distribution of Forests in China

In China's vast land, mountains and oceans differ by thousands of meters, and from north to south, there are different climates such as frigid-temperate, temperate, warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical. The distribution of China's forests is also complex and diverse, depending on the altitude and the warmth and coldness of the climate.

A brief introduction to the distribution of forests in China is as follows:

Frigid-Temperate Forests: Distributed in the northern part of the Greater Khingan Range, with Dahurian larch as the main tree species, interspersed with spruce, birch, oak, Scots pine, and other trees. It is China's primary timber supply base, which has not yet been fully developed.

Temperate Forests: Distributed in the southern part of the Greater Khingan Range, the Altai Mountains, the Nenjiang River, the Lesser Khingan Range, the Mudanjiang River, the Changbai Mountains, and other places, as well as the alpine forest areas in western Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi, and north of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, and the Xinglong and Qilian Mountains forest areas in Gansu. The Tianshan and Altai Mountains forest areas in Xinjiang also belong to the temperate forest range. The main trees here are excellent coniferous species such as spruce, fir, Korean pine, and larch, as well as deciduous broad-leaved species such as birch, linden, oak, elm, ash, Amur cork tree, maple, and poplar. They are the best timber species for bridges, sawn timber, railway sleepers, pit props, and papermaking.

Warm-Temperate Forests: Distributed in parts of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, including the South Xinjiang region. The forests here have a long history of development, and the forests have been severely damaged. Not much remains, and the distribution is scattered. Most of them are secondary forests, among which Pinus tabuliformis and Quercus spp. are the most widely distributed and cover the largest area.

Subtropical Forests: Distributed in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin and parts of Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Among the forests here, Cunninghamia lanceolata, Pinus massoniana, and Pinus yunnanensis are the most widely distributed, the most numerous, and grow the best. In particular, the latter two pine species can tolerate dry and barren soil and are pioneer tree species for afforestation. In addition to being used for railway sleepers, pit props, and construction timber, they are also the main raw materials for papermaking and fuel wood. As for Cunninghamia lanceolata, it is a fast-growing, high-quality timber tree species that is popular in various provinces and abundant in production. There are also broad-leaved mixed forests with a wide distribution here. The tree species are rich and colorful, mainly Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Magnoliaceae, and Theaceae trees. There are 200 to 400 kinds of trees in a small area, with various colors, patterns, specific gravities, and aromas, which can be used for shipbuilding, bridges, vehicle manufacturing, and construction. They are high-grade timber for furniture and special crafts. There are also many important economic trees in the broad-leaved forests, such as the seeds of tung oil trees and oil tea trees can be pressed for oil, the wood of Toona sinensis is hard and beautiful, the young buds are edible, the sap of lacquer trees can be used to make lacquer, and lychees and longans are not only excellent fruits, but also hard and beautiful high-quality timber.

Tropical Forests: Distributed in the Xishuangbanna region of southern Yunnan, the Hainan and Leizhou Peninsula regions of Guangdong, and the area south of Muping and Debao in Guangxi. The forests here are mainly composed of Moraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae, Leguminosae, Bombacaceae trees and bamboo, and famous tropical crops include rubber, coffee, and pepper, as well as large coconut groves and betel nut groves.

Alpine Forests: Such as the alpine coniferous forest areas in Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Tibet, and the main forest areas with rich forest reserves in the Bailong River, Tao River, Min River, Xiaojinchuan River, Dadu River, Lancang River, and Nujiang River. The main tree species are fir, spruce, hemlock, larch, juniper, and birch. The forest reserves in this area are second only to the Northeast and are the second key timber supply base for China's development. (Yi Huaiqing)

　　我国森林的分布
    在我国辽阔无边的土地上，高山和海洋相差数千公尺，从北到南，有寒温带，温带、暖温带、亚热带、热带等不同的气候。我国森林的分布也就随着地势的高低，气候的寒热，复杂多样。
    我国的森林的分布，简单介绍如下：
    寒温带森林：分布在大兴安岭北部地区，以兴安落叶松为主要林木，间有云杉、桦木、橡树、樟子松等树木，为我国尚未全面开发的首要用材供应基地。
    温带森林：分布在大兴安岭南部的阿尔泰山及嫩江及小兴安岭、牡丹江、长白山等地，内蒙古西部、河北和山西和陕西秦岭以北的各个高山林区和甘肃的兴龙、祁连山等林区，新疆的天山阿尔泰山林区，也都属于温带森林范围。这里主要的林木有云杉、冷杉、红松、落叶松等优良的针叶树种，有桦、椴、橡、榆、水曲柳、黄波罗、槭、杨等落叶阔叶树种，它们都是最好的桥梁、锯材、枕木、坑木、造纸等用材树种。
    暖温带森林：分布在河北、山东、山西、河南、陕西和甘肃部分地区，包括南疆地区。这里的森林有悠久的开发历史，森林破坏甚剧，残留不多，而且分布零散，绝大部分是次生林，其中，油松和栎属分布最多，面积也广。
    亚热带森林：分布在长江流域各省和福建、广东、广西、云南等部分地区。这里的森林以杉木、马尾松、云南松三者分布最广、数量最多、生长最好，特别是后两种松树都能耐干瘠土壤，为造林的先锋树种。它们的用途除供枕木、坑木、建筑等用材外，也是造纸的主要原料和薪炭用材。至于杉木，是速生优质用材树木，普及各省，产量丰富。这里森林分布较广的还有阔叶混交林，其间树种丰富多彩，以壳斗科、樟科、木兰科、山茶科树木为主，在小面积范围内就有二百至四百种乔木，具有各种不同的颜色、花纹、比重、芳香，可供造船、桥梁、制造车辆、建筑用，是家具及特种工艺的高级用材。阔叶林中还有许多重要的经济树木，如油桐、油茶等树的种子可以榨油，香椿树木材坚硬美观，嫩芽可食，漆树树液可制漆，荔枝、龙眼不仅是上好的水果，也是坚硬美丽的优质用材。
    热带森林：分布在云南南部西双版纳地区，广东海南和雷州半岛地区和广西睦边德保以南地区。这里的森林以桑科、大戟科、夹竹桃科、豆科、木棉科树木及竹类为主，著名的热带作物有橡胶、咖啡、胡椒，还有成片的椰子林、槟榔林。
    高原带森林：如川、甘、青、藏等地区的高山针叶林区，林木蓄积丰富的白龙江、洮河、岷江、大小金川、大渡河、澜沧江、怒江等主要林区。主要树种有冷杉、云杉、铁杉、落叶松、桧柏、桦木等。这个范围内的森林蓄积仅次于东北，为我国重点开发的第二个木材供应基地。　（易淮清）
