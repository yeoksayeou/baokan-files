    Seek Truth From Facts
    Establishing a complete system and earnestly verifying output has many benefits: ① It facilitates the implementation of the responsibility system and the production quota system; ② It helps to promote careful harvesting and meticulous threshing; ③ It facilitates correct distribution; ④ It facilitates the correct formulation of production plans; ⑤ It facilitates the correct summarization of production experience.
    Seeking truth from facts means seeking objective laws from real things. To seek the laws of high yield and the laws of distribution, we must first verify the "facts" of the harvest, neither higher nor lower than the actual. If it is too high or too low, it is impossible to find the real objective laws, and it will not benefit anyone. If it is neither high nor low, it conforms to the truth, and it will definitely be of great benefit to the large collective and the small collective, to the public and to the individual.

    实事求是
    定出一套完善的制度，认真核实产量，有很多好处：①便于贯彻执行责任制度和包产制度；②有助于促使精收细打；③便于正确地进行分配；④便于正确地制定生产计划；⑤便于正确地总结生产经验。
    实事求是，就是从实在的事情中寻求客观规律。要寻求丰产的规律和分配的规律，就必须先把收成的“事”核实，既不可高于实际，也不可低于实际。高了低了，都不可能寻出真正的客观规律，对谁都没有好处。不高不低，就合乎真理，必然对大集体和小集体、于公于私都大有好处。
