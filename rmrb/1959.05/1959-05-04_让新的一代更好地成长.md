Comrades,

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Today, I would like to share some opinions on the education of children and adolescents.

Our socialist system has created incomparably superior conditions for the growth of children and adolescents. The younger generation is receiving great love and care from the Party, the government, and all the people. Our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong taught children and adolescents to "study hard" and "make progress every day." Our children and adolescents have not failed the Party's teachings and expectations; they are indeed progressing every day. Last year, under the guidance of the General Line and the vigorous implementation of the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, China's education saw a great development and a great revolution. The connection between schools and society has been strengthened. Children and adolescents, while studying, participate in physical labor within their capacity, which gives them a more profound education. In order to firmly grasp knowledge, they study hard in school and engage in various interesting science and technology group activities related to classroom content. To acquire knowledge widely, children and adolescents in many places have also launched extracurricular reading activities. In Shanghai alone, 420,000 people participated in the Young Pioneers Medal Reading Campaign, and 150,000 received various awards. Currently, a mass extracurricular reading activity is continuing to unfold throughout the country. Children and adolescents also participate in social and political activities and productive labor within their capabilities. Last year, they enthusiastically carried out three activities: planting, eliminating the four pests, and speaking Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese), which achieved good results. Children and adolescents collected seeds and seedlings everywhere, planted trees and created forests, and planted oil crops. They said, "A seed is a heart, I have a share in building the motherland." In the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, children and adolescents are the most active and serious. Many cities' children and adolescents carried out hygiene watch activities. They actively promote hygiene and enthusiastically help others do cleaning and sanitation work. During the mass steelmaking movement, children and adolescents collected scrap iron, panned iron sand, and found refractory materials, contributing their share. After the rural areas implemented people's communes, Young Pioneers cleaned up the courtyards of the elderly in homes for the aged, read newspapers for them, made toys for the young children in kindergartens, and taught them to sing, dance, and play games. In many schools, they also set up small factories and small farms, learning production knowledge and labor skills in their spare time. The development of these activities has a profound impact on children and adolescents. Their young minds are changing. They are more concerned about the construction of the motherland and the future of the motherland. Everyone shows high spirits, small in stature but with great ambitions, and begins to gradually establish lofty ideals. Their horizons have been broadened, their knowledge has increased, and they are gradually developing labor habits. All of this powerfully proves the great victory of the Party's education policy.

Now, as our country is building a socialist society in a faster, better, and more economical way, further strengthening the education of children and adolescents is of great significance. Because when this generation grows up, they will not only participate in the work of building socialism, but also undertake the task of transitioning from socialism to communism. We should continue to carry forward past experiences and do a better job of educating the younger generation.

First, study hard

Childhood is a time to grow knowledge. We must guide children and adolescents to read carefully and systematically learn basic cultural and scientific knowledge in order to lay a good foundation for mastering the latest technology and modern scientific achievements in the future. If the new generation does not master the practical knowledge and skills to build socialism and communism, striving for communism is merely an empty wish. The first priority for children and adolescents is to study hard. Teachers play a leading role in the learning of children and adolescents. Due to the enormous development of primary education in our country last year, the teaching staff is rapidly expanding. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the teachers' political and ideological awareness and professional level in order to ensure the continuous improvement of teaching quality and enable children to learn better. At the same time, it is necessary to inspire students' learning initiative, make them understand the relationship between today's learning and future participation in the construction of the motherland, stimulate the desire for knowledge, and cultivate a good style of diligence, hard work, and perseverance. We should also organize visits, tours, and various science group activities to help children and adolescents enrich their knowledge, broaden their horizons, and learn to connect book knowledge with practice. In their spare time, we should also organize children and adolescents to read extracurricular books and help them develop the habit of reading newspapers and books regularly.

Here, I would like to talk about the issue of children's books. In recent years, with the care and attention of the Party and the state, the publication of children's books has greatly developed, and the quantity is already considerable. However, among these books, there are very few that reflect revolutionary struggles and scientific knowledge, and some books are of very low quality. The support from all sectors of society for the publication of children's books is also insufficient. For example, among the 1,055 topics listed in the creation plans reported by the local branches to the Chinese Writers Association, children's literature only accounts for three. This situation is abnormal. Recently, the National Writers Association has begun to pay attention to this issue. We hope that writers, educators, scientists, and other comrades will pick up their pens and write for children, and tell the precious knowledge to the young generation. "Little Picture Books" have a wide readership among children. At present, some of the content of "Little Picture Books" still has serious shortcomings. Some authors and painters are unwilling to engage in this kind of writing and drawing, thinking it is "not interesting." However, as long as we pay attention to the children, we can see that which child does not like "Little Picture Books"? Which "Little Picture Book" stall is not full of children? We should do a good job in the publication and organization of reading "Little Picture Books" and gradually meet the children's demands in this regard.

Gradually develop labor habits

Children and adolescents should study hard and gradually develop labor habits in the learning process. The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "Children over the age of nine can appropriately participate in some labor so that they can develop labor habits from an early age and promote physical and mental development; but it is necessary to fully take care of the health of children and assign them light, short-term labor suitable for children's physical strength and interests." According to the spirit of this resolution, we believe that when organizing children and adolescents to participate in labor, we should proceed from the requirements of education and achieve the purpose of education. The content, intensity, and duration of labor should all take into account the characteristics of children and adolescents, and there should be different requirements for children of different ages. Where conditions permit, small factories and small farms should be established on campus as bases for children and adolescents to participate in labor regularly. We suggest that the establishment of small factories and small farms should be included in the teaching plan. According to the different ages and knowledge levels of the children, they should learn some production knowledge and skills from the shallow to the deep and from the simple to the complex, and the labor should be linked to classroom teaching as much as possible. During holidays and spare time, children and adolescents should be appropriately organized to participate in public welfare labor and socialist construction so that children and adolescents can learn to be diligent from an early age, get used to caring about public interests, and care about the construction of the motherland.

While guiding children and adolescents to study hard and participate in appropriate labor, it is also necessary to strengthen their ideological education, widely carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities, improve their awareness, and cultivate them to have a healthy body and a lively character. Enable them to develop in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education.

In carrying out these tasks, the Young Pioneers play a significant role. October 13th of this year marks the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Young Pioneers. Over the past decade, the Young Pioneers have carried out many beneficial tasks among children and adolescents, and it has had a wide impact among children and adolescents. At present, there are 35 million members nationwide. We must continue to carry out lively and vigorous ideological and organizational work in the Young Pioneers, educate and encourage the Young Pioneers to study and live better, and enable the Young Pioneers to play a greater role in the cause of cultivating and educating the new generation.

Fellow representatives, the growth of the younger generation requires the education of schools, the Young Pioneers, and families, and requires the concern of the whole society. This is a task for all the people. Let us jointly take on this important task!

Finally, I would also like to talk about the Tibet issue. The armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique to betray the motherland has suffered a shameful defeat. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, after completely quelling the rebellion in the Lhasa area, has wiped out the bandits in the Shannan area in one fell swoop. We cheer for this great victory! The Tibetan reactionaries drove the Tibetan people to live a dark and miserable life. The growth of the younger generation was severely undermined. Even Young Pioneers wearing red scarves were beaten by the reactionaries. Today, with the failure of the Tibetan reactionaries' rebellion, the Tibetan people have begun to break away from the oppression of the barbaric, backward, and cruel serf system and embark on the road to a prosperous and happy new life. Tibet was, is, and always will be China's Tibet, an inseparable part of our great country. We warn those in India who interfere in our internal affairs: China's internal affairs brook no interference from anyone, and any conspiracy will surely be thoroughly defeated.

专栏：

    让新的一代更好地成长
    王伟代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。今天，我想就少年儿童的教育问题谈一点意见。
    我国社会主义制度为少年儿童的成长创造了无比优越的条件，少年儿童一代受到了党、政府和全体人民极大的爱护和关怀。我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席教导少年儿童“好好学习”，
  “天天向上”。我国少年儿童没有辜负党的教导和期望，他们正是天天地进步着。去年，在总路线的照耀下，党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的大力贯彻，我国教育事业出现了大发展、大革命的形势。学校和社会的联系加强了，少年儿童一面读书，一面参加力所能及的劳动，使他们受到了更为深刻的教育。为了牢固地掌握知识，他们在学校里努力学习功课，并联系课堂内容，进行了各种有趣味的科学技术小组的活动。为了广泛地获得知识，许多地方的少年儿童还开展了阅读课外书籍的活动。仅上海市就有四十二万人参加了红领巾奖章读书运动，受到了各种奖励的有十五万人。目前，一个群众性的阅读课外书籍的活动正在全国各地继续展开。少年儿童在力所能及的范围内，还参加了社会政治活动和生产劳动。去年，他们热烈地开展了种植、除四害、讲普通话三项活动，收到了良好的效果。少年儿童到处采种育苗，植树造林，种油料作物。他们说：“一颗种子一颗心，建设祖国我有份。”在除四害、讲卫生运动中，少年儿童是最积极、最认真的。许多城市的少年儿童开展了卫生岗的活动，他们积极宣传，还热心地帮助别人做好清洁卫生工作。全民炼钢运动中，少年儿童收集废铁、淘铁沙、找耐火材料，贡献了自己一份力量。农村实现人民公社化后，少先队员们为敬老院的老人们打扫卫生、读报，替幼儿园的小弟弟小妹妹做玩具，教他们唱歌、跳舞、做游戏。在许多学校里他们还办了小工厂、小农场，在课余时间学习生产知识，学习劳动技能。这些活动的开展，对少年儿童的影响是深远的，他们幼小的心灵在发生着变化，他们更加关心祖国的建设事业，关心祖国的未来，个个表现精神抖擞，人小志气大，开始逐步树立远大的理想。他们眼界开阔了，知识增长了，逐步养成着劳动习惯。这一切，都有力地证明了党的教育工作方针的伟大胜利。
    现在，正当我国多快好省地建设社会主义社会的时候，进一步加强对少年儿童的教育工作有着重大意义。因为，这一代人成长起来，不仅要参加建成社会主义的工作，而且由社会主义过渡到共产主义的建设任务，也将由他们承担。我们应该继续发扬过去的经验，把教育少年儿童一代的工作做得更好。
    首先要学好功课
    少年儿童时期正是长知识的时期，我们要引导少年儿童认真读书，系统地学习文化科学基础知识，以便为将来掌握最新的技术和现代科学成就打下良好的基础。新生一代如果不掌握建设社会主义和共产主义的实际知识和本领，为共产主义而奋斗只不过是一个空洞的愿望而已。少年儿童的学习，首先是学好功课。教师对少年儿童的学习起着主导作用。由于去年我国初等教育的巨大发展，教师队伍在迅速扩大，因此迫切需要提高教师的政治思想觉悟和业务水平，以保证教学质量的不断提高，使孩子们学习得更好。同时，要启发学生的学习自觉性，使他们了解今天的学习和将来参加祖国建设的关系，激发求知欲望，培养勤奋好学、不怕困难、刻苦钻研的好风气。并且组织参观、访问和各种科学小组的活动，帮助少年儿童丰富知识，扩大眼界，学习着把书本知识和实际联系起来。在课余的时间，还要组织少年儿童阅读课外书籍，帮助他们养成经常阅读书报的习惯。
    在这里，我想谈谈关于儿童读物的问题。几年来，在党和国家的关怀和重视下，少年儿童读物的出版，已有很大发展，数量已不算少，但是，在这些读物中，反映革命斗争和关于科学知识方面的书很少，有些读物质量很低。社会各方面对儿童读物出版的支持也还不够，如中国作家协会收到各地分会报来的创作计划所列的一千零五十五种题材中，儿童文学只占三种。这种情况是不正常的。最近全国作协已经开始重视这个问题。我们希望作家、教育工作者、科学工作者等各方面同志，拿起笔来，为孩子写作，把宝贵的知识告诉年幼的一代。“小人书”在儿童中拥有广泛的读者，目前有些“小人书”的内容还有严重缺点，有些作者和画家不愿意从事这方面的编著和绘画，认为“没意思”。但是，只要我们注意一下孩子，就可以看到，哪一个孩子不喜欢“小人书”？哪一个“小人书”摊不坐满孩子？我们应该把有关“小人书”的出版和组织阅读的工作搞好，逐步地满足孩子们在这方面的要求。
    逐步养成劳动习惯
    少年儿童要好好学习，在学习过程中逐步养成劳动习惯。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：“九岁以上的儿童可以适当地参加一些劳动，以便自幼养成劳动习惯，促进身心发育；但是必须充分照顾到儿童的健康，分配以适合儿童体力和兴趣的轻微的、短时间的劳动。”根据这个决议的精神，我们认为在组织少年儿童参加劳动的时候，应该从教育的要求出发，并达到教育的目的。无论劳动的内容、强度和时间，都应当照顾少年儿童的特点，对于年龄不同的儿童，应当有不同的要求。有条件的地方，在校内建立小工厂小农场，作为少年儿童经常参加劳动的基地。我们建议，要把办小工厂小农场列入教学计划，按照儿童年龄和知识水平的不同，使他们由浅入深、由简而繁地学到一些生产知识和技能，并且要尽可能地把劳动和课堂教学联系起来。在假期和课余时间，适当地组织少年儿童参加公益劳动和社会主义建设，使少年儿童从小就学得勤快，习惯于关心公众利益，关心祖国建设事业。
    在引导少年儿童认真读书，参加适当的劳动的同时，还要加强对他们的思想教育，广泛开展文娱体育活动，提高他们的自觉性，培养他们具有健壮的身体和活泼的性格。使他们在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展。
    在开展这些工作中，少先队有很大的作用。今年十月十三日是少先队建队十周年纪念日。十年来少先队在少年儿童中进行了许多有益的工作，它在少年儿童中有了广泛的影响。目前全国队员已达三千五百万人。我们要继续在少先队中开展生动活泼的思想工作和组织工作，教育和鼓舞少先队员们更好地学习和生活，使少先队在培养教育新生一代的事业中发挥更大的作用。
    各位代表，少年一代的成长，需要学校、少先队和家庭的教育，需要全社会来关心。这是一个全民的任务，让我们共同把这个重大任务担当起来！
    最后，我还要谈谈西藏问题。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国的武装叛乱，已经遭到可耻的失败。人民解放军驻西藏部队，继彻底平息拉萨地区叛乱之后，又一举荡平山南地区叛匪。我们为这一伟大胜利欢呼！西藏反动派驱使西藏人民过着暗无天日的生活，青、少年一代的成长受到严重摧残，连少先队员戴红领巾也要受到反动分子毒打。今天，随着西藏反动派叛乱的失败，西藏人民已经开始摆脱野蛮、落后、残酷的农奴制的压迫，走上繁荣、幸福新生活的大道。西藏过去是，现在是，将来也永远是中国的西藏，是我们伟大国家不可分割的一部分。我们警告印度干涉我国内政的人：中国内政决不容许任何人干涉，任何阴谋一定会遭到彻底的失败。
