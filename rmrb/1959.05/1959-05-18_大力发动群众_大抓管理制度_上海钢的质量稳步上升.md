Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 17th: Shanghai's iron and steel industry departments have mobilized the masses to vigorously grasp management systems. Since the beginning of this year, not only has steel production gradually increased, but the quality has also improved rapidly. The average qualified rate of steel in the city was 93% in January, rose to 95.5% in February, and further increased to 96.8% in April.

This year, Shanghai factories, based on thorough discussions among the masses, have gradually established and revised new management systems and new operating procedures. In the past few months, the vast majority of steel plants have revised and rectified the raw material management system, various inspection and testing systems, cupola and converter operating procedures, and reorganized the mass-based production post responsibility system. The revision of these basic systems has enabled the entire production order of steel production, from raw materials entering the factory to finished products leaving the factory, to be established on a new basis, which has greatly contributed to the rapid improvement of steel quality.

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, pig iron from all over the country has been continuously supplied to Shanghai. Sometimes a steel plant uses different pig iron from twenty or thirty regions simultaneously. Therefore, establishing a new raw material management system to ensure the stability of the cupola's raw material composition has become the key to improving the quality of steel ingots. Shanghai Steel Plant No. 6, No. 3, and other factories took the lead in mobilizing the masses to summarize a set of management systems of "batch stacking and mixed use." After implementing this system, although the incoming material situation is complex, the material yard order of each factory is still very good. The material transport workers select and mix pig iron from material piles of different compositions, ensuring the stability of pig iron composition, which greatly improves the desulfurization effect of cupolas and steelmaking furnaces and effectively improves the quality of steel ingots. Each factory has also reorganized and strengthened the organization of the inspection sections (groups) and laboratories, so that inspection and testing work not only prevents bad materials from entering the factory and bad finished products from leaving the factory but also promotes quality improvement.

The revision of operating procedures and the establishment of mass-based production post responsibility systems are important measures to ensure product quality technically. After Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3's No. 1 converter workshop revised the operating procedures and established a clearly defined post responsibility system, it truly achieved "everyone has a post, and everything is managed by someone." They also selected a worker from each work section to serve as an operation inspector, responsible for daily supervision of the implementation of operating procedures. This ensures the implementation of various systems, and not only the output and quality of steel are gradually improved, but also production accidents are greatly reduced. (Attached picture)

### 大力发动群众　大抓管理制度  上海钢的质量稳步上升

    大力发动群众　大抓管理制度
    上海钢的质量稳步上升
    据新华社上海17日电　上海市钢铁工业部门发动群众大抓管理制度，今年以来不仅钢产量逐步提高，质量上升也很快。全市钢的合格率1月份平均为93％，2月份上升到95.5％，4月份再升到96.8％。
    今年，上海各厂在群众充分讨论的基础上，逐步建立和修订新的管理制度，新的操作规程。几个月来，极大多数钢铁厂已经修订和整顿了原料管理制度，各种检验和化验制度，化铁炉、转炉的操作规程，以及重新整顿了群众性的生产岗位责任制度。这些基本制度的修订，使钢铁生产从原料进厂到成品出厂的整个生产秩序开始在新的基础上建立起来，对钢的质量迅速提高起了很大作用。
    去年大跃进以来，全国各地生铁源源供应上海，有时一家钢铁厂同时采用二、三十个地区的不同生铁，因此，建立新的原料管理制度，保证化铁炉用料成分稳定，便成为提高钢锭质量的关键。上钢六厂、三厂等工厂首先发动群众总结出一套“分批堆放，搭配使用”的管理制度。实行这一制度以后，虽然来料情况复杂，各厂料场秩序仍然很好，运料工人从不同成分的料堆上选用和搭配生铁，保证了生铁成分稳定，使化铁炉和炼钢炉去硫效果大大提高，有效地提高了钢锭质量。各厂还重新整顿和加强了检验科（组）和化验室的机构，使检验和化验工作不仅要起到防止坏料进厂和坏成品出厂，而且要起促进质量提高的作用。
    操作规程的修订和群众性生产岗位责任制的建立，是从技术上保证产品质量的重要措施。上钢三厂第一转炉车间在修订操作规程的同时，建立了职责分明的岗位责任制后，真正做到了“人人有岗位、事事有人管”。他们还从各工段选出一个工人担任操作检查员，负责日常监督执行操作规程。这样就保证了各种制度的贯彻执行，不仅钢的产量、质量逐步提高，生产事故也大大减少。（附图片）
