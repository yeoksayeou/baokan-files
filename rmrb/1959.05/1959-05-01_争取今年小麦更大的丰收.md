　　Chairman, fellow delegates:

　　I fully endorse Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and will strive for their complete realization in my work.

　　Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with and supported by British imperialists and Indian expansionists, launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and undermining unity, attempting to split Tibet from the motherland and permanently maintain its dark and cruel serf system. I express my infinite indignation on behalf of the 50 million people of Henan Province. This rebellion has suffered a shameful defeat after the Central People's Government promptly took resolute and thorough measures to quell it. I express my sincere support on behalf of the 50 million people of Henan Province. British imperialists and Indian expansionists should be seriously warned that Tibet is an integral part of China's sacred territory. The Chinese people are quelling a rebellion on their own territory, and no interference from any foreigners is allowed. If those political careerists do not recognize Mount Tai and dare to provoke the Chinese people, they will surely be taught a bloody lesson.

　　Now I will talk about the situation in which the people of Henan Province, under the leadership of the Party, are working with soaring enthusiasm to strive for a greater wheat harvest in 1959. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the people of the entire Henan province, on the basis of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on industrial and agricultural production in 1958, are holding high the red flag of the general line for building socialism and fighting heroically to realize the four major production targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton proposed by the CPC Central Committee for 1959. In industry, following the principle of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward," we are concentrating our efforts and vigorously carrying out the campaign to double steel and coal production. In agriculture, adhering to the spirit of taking grain as the key link, we have launched an agricultural bumper harvest campaign centered on wheat field management throughout the province since last winter. The broad masses of people, braving the severe cold and strong winds in the wheat field management last winter and this spring, launched a massive offensive towards the wheat fields. During the production battle last winter, the members of the communes proposed: "Not afraid of the cold, not afraid of the chill, we must turn the cold days into hot days, work hard and skillfully, and ensure that the wheat doubles again," "The colder the weather, the higher the enthusiasm, break through the cold wind to water the wheat; we must ensure that the wheat seedlings eat enough fertilizer and drink enough water, and guarantee that the satellites soar to the ninth heaven." In the movement, countless heroic deeds and moving examples emerged. After a winter and a spring of hard struggle, the more than 70 million mu of wheat throughout the province have generally grown lush and strong, dense and vigorous, and unprecedentedly good, and have now begun to head (heading half a month earlier than in previous years), and a bumper harvest is in sight. According to surveys and statistics from various places, more than 20 million mu of first-class wheat seedlings with outstanding growth are expected to yield more than 500 jin per mu, of which more than 1 million mu of "experimental fields" are growing particularly well and are expected to yield 1,000 to 2,000 jin per mu. About 35 million mu of second-class wheat seedlings with generally good growth are expected to yield about 300 jin per mu. About 15 million mu of third-class wheat seedlings with relatively poor growth are expected to yield about 150 jin per mu. Judging from the current growth of wheat, if no major natural disasters occur in the next forty days, it is entirely possible to increase the total output by about 50% compared with last year and achieve a greater leap forward.

　　The main reasons why Henan's wheat can grow unprecedentedly well this year are the following five points:

　　First, in terms of cultivation technology, the experience of the great wheat harvest in 1958 was summarized and promoted, and the "Eight-Point Charter" for increasing agricultural production was conscientiously implemented. In terms of deep plowing, last autumn, the province organized more than 16 million people to carry out a vigorous and enthusiastic deep plowing campaign. About 80% of the wheat fields were deeply plowed to a depth of eight inches to one foot, doubling the depth of the general cultivated layer of five inches in previous years. Among them, 20 million mu of high-yield squares and satellite fields were deeply plowed to more than one foot. In terms of fertilizer, "fertilizer taking the lead" was implemented last winter and this spring, and a mass campaign of accumulating and producing fertilizer was carried out. Not only was a large amount of farm manure accumulated, but also a large amount of local chemical fertilizer was produced. The quantity of fertilizer was greatly increased compared with previous years, and the quality was greatly improved. The amount of base fertilizer and top dressing applied per mu was generally about 20,000 jin, doubling the amount applied in previous years. The "satellite fields" and "high-yield squares" were fertilized even more, with some reaching more than 100,000 jin. In terms of improved varieties, when sowing wheat, improved varieties such as "Bima No. 1," "Bima No. 4," and "Nanda 2419" were generally promoted, and the province basically realized the improvement of wheat varieties. In terms of dense planting, generally 25 to 30 jin of seeds were sown per mu, increasing the amount of seeds sown by more than double compared with previous years, basically achieving rational dense planting and timely sowing. In terms of water conservancy, large-scale leveling and rectifying of fields was carried out, and more than 20 million mu of wheat fields in the province were realized as garden fields. Many wheat fields were made as flat as a mirror and the ridges as straight as lines, laying a good foundation for fully utilizing the effectiveness of existing water conservancy projects and winter and spring irrigation of wheat. In the wheat irrigation campaign, the principle of building and using water conservancy projects simultaneously was implemented. More than 560,000 canals, more than 4,900 reservoirs, more than 200,000 ponds, more than 500,000 water wells, more than 1,600 sets of power-operated water lifting tools, more than 350,000 waterwheels, and more than 3.31 million other types of water lifting tools were utilized throughout the province. More than 440,000 new and renovated canals and more than 4,160 reservoirs were built, and nearly 100,000 wells were dug, with more than 1.1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work already completed. The masses proposed one after another: "Thousands of troops and horses are mobilized, large and small canals are repaired, reservoirs, ponds, wells and springs are utilized, and we will not stop until the wheat irrigation is completed." On both banks of the Yellow River, the original and newly built large-scale Yellow River diversion and irrigation projects last year were used to irrigate more than 15 million mu of wheat fields. The masses happily said: "In the past, everyone was afraid of the Yellow River water, but now we use it to irrigate crops; Chairman Mao's leadership is good, and the people's communes are powerful; the Yellow River, which has been a scourge for thousands of years, has become a beneficial river, and the Yellow River is tamed to listen to people." After the great efforts of last winter and this spring, a total of more than 80 million mu times of wheat were irrigated throughout the province (two special zones basically did not need irrigation due to heavy rainfall), enabling the wheat to successfully overcome the turning green stage and the jointing stage. A series of work has been done and great results have been achieved in other aspects such as tool reform, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, prevention of wind and sand, and prevention of frost.

　　Second, the Party's general line for building socialism was resolutely implemented, politics was put in command, the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act was continued, and various erroneous ideas were criticized. On the one hand, the new conservative ideas such as the "wheat production has reached its peak theory," "cannot continuously leap forward theory," and "maintain the status quo theory" were criticized; on the other hand, the spirit of seeking truth from facts was emphasized, closely combining revolutionary soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and basing the plan on both active and reliable foundations. At the same time, the complacent and paralyzing idea that this year's conditions are good and a bumper harvest can be obtained without hard work, such as the "production flows naturally theory" and "waiting for a bumper harvest theory" was also criticized. In this way, the mass movement to strive for a greater wheat harvest can develop healthily and smoothly.

　　Third, the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC was conscientiously implemented, and the people's communes were generally consolidated, improved, and upgraded. Unified leadership, graded management, and graded accounting were implemented. The principle of payment according to work and equivalent exchange was implemented, especially after the universal implementation of the policies of contracting work to teams, output quotas to teams, rewards for overproduction, fixed grades with flexible evaluation, and more pay for more work, the labor enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of members were further brought into play, and the meticulous management of wheat by the members was strengthened more than ever before. Thus, the people's communes have shown greater and greater superiority and boundless vitality in developing production.

　　Fourth, mass wheat bumper harvest competition campaigns were vigorously carried out. Mass movements were persistently carried out in various production processes such as deep plowing, wheat sowing, fertilizer accumulation, fertilization, and winter and spring irrigation. In particular, the Yanshi wheat field management on-site conference and wheat bumper harvest symposium convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC in February this year played a great role in promoting the wheat bumper harvest competition campaign. Through these two meetings, a mass upsurge of wheat field management production was rapidly set off throughout the province. At present, this movement is developing in depth. In the movement, the masses in various places proposed one after another: "Learn from Meng County, catch up with Yanshi, strive for the upstream, and strive for the first." Wheat field management was generally strengthened, and a strict responsibility system was established. We should grasp both ends and lead the middle, engage in high-yield squares in a big way, consolidate first-class seedlings, improve second-class seedlings, and eliminate third-class seedlings. Moreover, water and fertilizer should be applied simultaneously, and both should be grasped at the same time. We are determined to grasp the five major stages of returning green, jointing, pregnancy, filling, and flowering. We will strive to ensure that the wheat "eats and drinks enough," with many heads, large ears, and full grains. All people's communes have cultivated large areas of "high-yield squares" and high-yield "satellite" fields, which is a prominent feature of this year's wheat bumper harvest campaign and an important guarantee for the wheat bumper harvest. The method of "high-yield squares" created by the masses is not only a new and good method for leading the large-scale bumper harvest movement of agriculture, but also a way to gradually realize high yield, less planting, more harvest, and large-scale landscaping.

　　Fifth, Party and government leading organs at all levels have strengthened their leadership over wheat field management and adhered to the working method of the mass line. The Party committee secretary took the lead, and members were assigned to divide and contract areas. A large number of leading cadres went deep into the fields and planted experimental fields with the masses, leading production with production. Telephone conferences, radio conferences, and on-site conferences were held continuously, visits and comparisons were organized, and advanced experience was summarized and disseminated in a timely manner. Many county and commune leading cadres implemented the practice of working in the fields, directing on the spot, and solving various practical problems in wheat field management in a timely manner. For example, five county party secretaries and eight county party committee members in Fugou County, leading more than 1,000 cadres and more than 60,000 commune members, worked day and night to give full play to the effectiveness of various water conservancy projects, reaching 100,000 mu of wheat irrigated per day. In the wheat irrigation campaign in the Kaifeng Special Zone, many places achieved "the main canal has a commander, the branch canal has a general, and the farm canal has soldiers, responding to each other from top to bottom and acting universally." It is precisely because leading cadres went deep into the fields and mingled with the masses that this year's wheat field management work was done better than in any previous year.

　　Fellow delegates, although Henan's wheat has grown unprecedentedly well due to the above five reasons, and there is great hope for striving for a greater bumper harvest than in the past, this does not mean that a bumper harvest has already been achieved. There is still more than a month left before the wheat harvest. In the later stage of wheat field management, there are still some problems, and a series of work and huge efforts are still needed. First of all, we must grasp the wheat heading stage, flowering stage, and filling stage, and water and top dress as much as possible according to the needs of wheat growth. Secondly, we must make a concentrated effort to eliminate third-class seedlings. The main method is to water more and apply quick-acting fertilizers. Thirdly, we must prevent and control various diseases and insect pests of wheat in a timely manner. We must universally strengthen the intelligence work on diseases and insect pests, and try our best to "eliminate early, eliminate small, and eliminate completely." Fourthly, we must rescue the very few wheat that has lodged due to excessive dense planting, and take various effective measures to prevent the lodging of wheat that is growing well, which is an important issue to ensure this year's wheat harvest. Finally, we must quickly do all the preparatory work for the wheat harvest, and earnestly achieve timely harvesting, quick harvesting and threshing, careful harvesting and threshing, and returning all grains home for a bumper harvest. All these tasks must seize the opportunity, not miss the farming season, continue to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and carry out mass movements in a big way.

　　Wheat is one of the main food crops in Henan, and Henan is one of the important wheat producing areas in the country. Realizing a greater wheat harvest this year is of great significance for completing the grain production increase targets of our province and the country, and for supporting the country's socialist construction. We must, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, continue to organize and mobilize the 50 million people of the province, muster greater enthusiasm, and do everything possible to strive for a greater wheat harvest this year!

    争取今年小麦更大的丰收
    赵文甫代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理关于政府工作的报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并且在工作中为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    最近，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子狼狈为奸的嗾使与支持之下，发动了背叛祖国破坏统一的武装叛乱，企图把西藏从祖国分裂出去，永远保持其黑暗残酷的农奴制度。对此，我代表河南省五千万人民表示无限的愤慨。这个叛乱，在中央人民政府迅速地采取了坚决彻底平息的英明措施以后，已经遭到了可耻的失败。对此，我代表河南省五千万人民表示竭诚的拥护。应当严重警告英帝国主义和印度的扩张主义分子，西藏是中国神圣领土的一部分，中国人民在自己的领土上平息叛乱，决不允许任何外国人的任何干涉。如果那些政治野心家有眼不识泰山，竟敢向中国人民挑衅，那就一定要叫他碰个鼻青脸肿，头破血流。
    现在我来谈一谈河南省人民在党的领导下，干劲冲天的争取一九五九年小麦更大丰收的情况。河南全省人民，在党中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，在一九五八年获得以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进的基础上，正高举着建设社会主义总路线的红旗，为实现中共中央所提出的一九五九年钢、煤、粮、棉四大生产指标而英勇奋斗。在工业上，遵照着以“以钢为纲、全面跃进”的方针，集中力量，大力地开展着钢铁、煤炭生产的翻番运动。在农业上，本着以粮为纲的精神，从去年冬季以来，在全省范围内，开展了以麦田管理为中心的农业丰产运动。广大人民群众，在去冬今春的麦田管理中，不畏严寒狂风，向麦田大举进军。在去冬生产战斗中，社员们提出：“不怕冷，不怕寒，要把冷天变热天，大干苦干加巧干，保证小麦再加番”，“天越冷，劲越高，冲破寒风把麦浇；要使麦苗吃饱肥喝足水，保证卫星冲九霄”。在运动中，涌现出了无数的英雄事迹和动人事例。经过一冬一春的艰苦奋斗，全省七千多万亩小麦普遍生长得油绿茁壮，茂密旺盛，空前良好，现在已经开始抽穗（比往年早抽穗半个月），丰收在望。根据各地的调查统计，全省生长得突出良好的一类麦苗有两千多万亩，预计亩产可达五百斤以上，其中有一百多万亩“试验田”生长特别良好，预计亩产可达一、两千斤以上。生产一般良好的二类麦苗有三千五百万亩左右，预计亩产可达三百斤左右。生长比较差一些的三类麦苗有一千五百万亩左右，预计亩产可达一百五十斤左右。从当前小麦生长的情况看，在今后四十天内，如果不发生特大的自然灾害，总产量比去年增长百分之五十左右，实现更大的跃进，是完全可能的。
    今年河南的小麦所以能够生长得空前良好，其原因主要有以下五点：
    第一，在耕作技术上，总结和推广了一九五八年小麦大丰收的经验，认真地贯彻执行了农业增产的“八字宪法”。在深耕方面，去年秋后，全省组织了一千六百多万人，开展了轰轰烈烈的、热火朝天的深翻土地运动，有百分之八十左右的麦田深翻了八寸到一尺，比往年土地一般的耕层五寸左右加深了一倍上下，其中有二千万丰产方和卫星田深耕一尺以上。在肥料方面，去冬今春实行了“肥料挂帅”，开展了全民性的积肥造肥运动，不但积攒了大量的农家肥料，而且还制造了大量的土化肥，肥料的数量比往年大大增加，质量大大提高，每亩施底肥和追肥一般都在两万斤左右，比往年增加了一倍上下，其中“卫星田”、“丰产方”施肥更多，有的达到十多万斤。在良种方面，小麦下种时，普遍推广了“碧玛一号”、“碧玛四号”、“南大2419”等优良品种，全省基本上实现了小麦良种化。在密植方面，一般每亩下种二十五斤到三十斤，比往年下种量增加一倍以上，基本上达到了合理密植，做到了适时播种。在水利方面，进行了大规模的平地整畦，全省有两千多万亩的麦田实现了园田化，许多麦田做到了地平如镜，畦直如线，为充分发挥已有水利工程的效能和小麦的冬浇春浇打下了良好的基础。在浇麦运动中，对水利工程贯彻了边建设边使用的方针，全省利用起来的渠道有五十六万多条，水库四千九百多座，坑塘二十多万个，水井五十多万眼，动力提水工具一千六百多部，水车三十五万多部，其他各种提水工具三百三十一万多件。新修和整修的渠道有四十四万多条，水库四千一百六十座，打井近十万眼，已经做的土石方工程十一亿多公方。群众纷纷提出：“千军万马齐出动，大小渠道都修通，库塘井泉都利用，完不成浇麦不收兵。”在黄河两岸，利用了原有和去年新建的大型引黄灌溉工程，共灌溉麦田一千五百多万亩。群众高兴地说：“从前黄水人人怕，现在用它浇庄稼；毛主席的领导好，人民公社力量大；万年害河变利河，驯服黄河听人话。”经过去冬今春的巨大努力，全省共浇麦八千多万亩次（有两个专区因雨水多基本上不需要浇水），使小麦已经胜利地渡过了返青关、拔节关。其他在工具改革、防治病虫害、防风沙、防霜冻等方面，都作了一系列的工作，取得了很大的成效。
    第二，坚决贯彻执行了党的建设社会主义的总路线，实行了政治挂帅，继续发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，批判了各种错误思想。一方面，批判了那种小麦“增产到顶论”、“不能连续跃进论”、“维持现状论”等新的保守思想；另一方面，强调了实事求是的精神，把革命的冲天干劲和科学分析密切结合起来，把计划建立在既积极又可靠的基础上。同时，还批判了那种认为今年条件好，不需要艰苦奋斗就可以获得丰收的“生产自流论”、“坐等丰收论”自满麻痹思想。这样，就使争取小麦更大丰收的群众运动，能够健康地、顺利地向前发展。
    第三，认真贯彻执行了中共八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，普遍地整顿、巩固、提高了人民公社。实行了统一领导，分级管理，分级核算。贯彻了按劳付酬、等价交换的原则，尤其是普遍实行了包工包产、超产奖励、死级活评、多劳多得的政策以后，进一步发挥了广大社员的劳动热忱和生产积极性，社员对于小麦的精心管理，比过去任何时候都加强了。从而，人民公社在发展生产方面，显示了越来越大的优越性和旺盛无比的生命力。
    第四，大力开展了群众性的小麦丰产竞赛运动。在深翻土地、小麦播种、积肥、施肥、冬浇春浇等各个生产过程中，都坚持地开展了群众运动。尤其是中共河南省委在今年二月份召开的偃师麦田管理现场会议和小麦丰产座谈会议，对于小麦丰产竞赛运动起了极大的推动作用。通过这两次会议，在全省范围内迅速地掀起了群众性的麦田管理生产高潮。目前这个运动正在向着纵深方面发展。在运动中，各地群众纷纷提出“学孟县，赶偃师，争上游，争第一”。普遍加强了麦田管理，建立了严格的责任制。抓两头带中间，大搞丰产方，巩固一类苗，提高二类苗，消灭三类苗。并且水、肥兼施，双管齐下，决心抓好返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆、扬花五大关。努力保证小麦“吃饱喝足”，头多穗大籽饱。各个人民公社都培育了大面积的“丰产方”和高额“卫星”田，这是今年小麦丰产运动的一个突出特点，也是小麦丰产的一项重要保证。群众所创造的这种“丰产方”的办法，不仅是领导农业大面积丰产运动一种新的良好方法，而且为逐步实现高产、少种、多收和大地园林化找到了一条途径。
    第五，各级党政领导机关加强了对麦田管理的领导，坚持了群众路线的工作方法。党委书记挂帅，委员分工分片包干。大批领导干部深入田间，和群众一道种植试验田，以生产领导生产。不断地召开了电话会、广播会、现场会，组织参观评比，及时的总结传播了先进经验。许多县、社领导干部实行了到田办公，就地指挥，及时地解决了麦田管理中的各种实际问题。例如，扶沟县五个县委书记、八个县委委员，带领一千多名干部，同六万多名社员一起，日夜鏖战，充分发挥各种水利工程的效能，达到日浇小麦十万亩。开封专区在浇麦运动中，许多地方作到了“干渠有帅，支渠有将，农毛渠有兵，上下呼应，普遍行动”。正是由于领导干部深入田间，同群众打成一片，所以今年的麦田管理工作比过去任何一年作得都好。
    各位代表，目前河南的小麦，虽然由于上述五种原因，生长得空前良好，争取比过去有一个更大的丰收大有希望，但是，这并不等于已经获得了丰收。现在距离收麦，还有一个多月的时间，在麦田的后期管理工作中，还存在着一些问题，还要做一系列的工作和巨大的努力。首先，要抓好麦子抽穗关、扬花关、灌浆关，根据麦子生长的需要，最大限度地浇水和追肥。其次，要突击消灭三类苗，其办法主要是多浇水，增施速效肥料。再次，要及时防治麦子的各种病虫害，要普遍加强病虫害的情报工作，尽量做到“消灭早、消灭小、消灭了”。再次，要抢救极少数因密植过分而倒伏的麦子，并且要采取各种有效办法防止生长良好的麦子可能发生的倒伏现象，这是保证今年麦子丰收的一个重要问题。最后，要迅速做好麦收的各项准备工作，切实做到适时收割，快收快打，细收细打，颗粒还家，丰产丰收。所有这些工作，都必须抓紧时机，不误农时，继续依靠群众，发动群众，大搞群众运动。
    小麦是河南的主要粮食作物之一，河南是国家小麦重要产地之一，实现今年小麦的更大丰收，对完成我省和国家的粮食增产指标，对支援国家社会主义建设，都有着重大的意义。我们要在党中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下。在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，继续组织和发动全省五千万人民，鼓足更大的干劲，千方百计，为实现今年小麦更大的丰收而奋斗！
