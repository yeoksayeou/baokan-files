　　**Our Moscow Dispatch, May 12th:** During the period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction, in the national-scale production competition to strive for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan, Soviet Communist Party members are courageously standing on the front lines. Currently, whether in industrial enterprises, construction sites, or in collective farms and pastures, tens of thousands of CPC members are setting an example, closely uniting the broad masses, and working together to realize the Party's grand communist construction tasks.
    
    CPC members have always been the vanguard in implementing the Party's various calls. After the 21st Congress of the Party, Party organizations at all levels and local Party members throughout the Soviet Union actively took the lead in responding to the resolutions of the Party Congress, and a new situation of unprecedented political and labor enthusiasm emerged throughout the country. Party members on various production fronts were the first to propose guarantees to strive for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan. At the same time, under the leadership of Party members, a vigorous competition movement was launched to complete the production tasks of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The well-known Donbas coal miners and Communist Party members Mamai and Kolichenko were among the first to propose a guarantee to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years, and they challenged the whole country with this, receiving enthusiastic support from workers in all walks of life. Now, the production team led by Mamai is effectively implementing its production plan. The team's production plan for the first quarter has been overfulfilled. Their "Northern" No. 2 mine originally planned to produce an extra 2.5 tons of coal per person per shift above the plan, but as a result, in the first quarter of this year, the average increase in production was 3.1 tons per person per shift, increasing the country's coal production significantly. Tens of thousands of factories in Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kiev and other cities have participated in the production competition under the leadership of Party members, and have overfulfilled their first quarter production tasks by about 5% to 10%. Balashkin, a steelmaking worker and Communist Party member at the Minsk Heavy Automobile Factory, overfulfills his production plan every shift. He originally planned to produce thirteen tons of steel per shift, but in reality, his current output has reached sixteen to eighteen tons per shift, and many days it has exceeded twenty-three tons. His enthusiasm has increased the production enthusiasm of all the workers in the workshop, and the workshop's production plan has been completed very well. On the vast drilling sites of the new Guryev oil area in Kazakhstan, the old driller and Communist Party member Maknutov not only overfulfilled his own production tasks, but also traveled to every drilling site in the area to help everyone overcome difficulties and complete the task of producing oil ahead of schedule. When the "Advancing to Communism" collective farm in the Moscow region began its busy spring plowing, the deputy of tractor driver Levov suddenly fell ill, and it looked like it would affect the spring plowing, and the villagers were very worried. At this time, tractor driver Levov did not hesitate and immediately expressed his determination to the Party: one person will do the work of two people. He said: "I am a Communist Party member, and I can work like this." In this way, he went out early and returned late, planting fourteen hectares on the first day, increasing to seventeen hectares on the second day, and increasing to nineteen hectares on the third day, exceeding the workload of two people. This example inspired all the villagers, enabling them to exert even greater enthusiasm. Now, on the production front, examples of Soviet Communist Party members playing an exemplary leading role can be seen and heard everywhere. This spirit of selfless labor of CPC members on the communist construction front has become an important force to inspire the Soviet laboring people's confidence in realizing the communist construction plan.

    At the same time, CPC members are also active participants and leaders in the movement to strive for "Communist Labor Teams" and "Communist Shock Workers." At present, there are more than 60,000 production organizations throughout the Soviet Union striving for the title of "Communist Labor Team." Most of the labor teams have excellent Party members participating in the leadership, and they are realizing the slogan of "working, studying, and living in a communist way" together with all the team members.

    In order to better play the exemplary leading role of Party members, and to more closely link Party members with non-Party masses, recently, the work of Party organizations at all levels, especially the grassroots organizations of the Party, has become more vivid, active, specific and diverse than before. Grassroots organizations generally hold regular open Party meetings, and organize various activities with the participation and leadership of Party members: such as workshop production meetings, production technology innovation groups, individual heart-to-heart talks between Party and non-Party masses, political class studies, Communist Youth League evenings, factory cultural universities, and so on. Party organizations and Party members use these gatherings to widely attract the masses to participate in discussions on major issues such as the factory's production and life, attract non-Party masses to make criticisms, and urge Party members to work hard, thereby promoting production and strengthening unity. For example, the South Ural Machine Manufacturing Factory received the task of rushing to produce a batch of special steel equipment in the first quarter of this year. This task was complex and urgent. At that time, the workshop Party organization immediately convened an open Party congress to let everyone discuss how to complete the task. At the congress, Party members and non-Party masses spoke enthusiastically and put forward many good methods. As a result, the task was completed on schedule. At an open Party meeting held in the steel plate workshop of this factory, the attendees put forward more than 30 rationalization proposals, which increased the steel plate production efficiency by 20%. In the past three months, under the leadership of Party members, the factory has put forward 338 rationalization proposals, saving the country more than 1.5 million rubles, and overfulfilling the first quarter production plan. The individual heart-to-heart talks between Party members and non-Party masses held in many factories in Kharkov widely discussed the issue of how to tap production potential and achieved good results. In one month alone, Party members and non-Party workers in various factories in the Lenin District of Kharkov City put forward more than 12,000 rationalization proposals, improved production technology, and greatly improved labor productivity. With the surging enthusiasm of Party members for conscious labor, the work of Party organizations at all levels is also more in-depth and meticulous, which guarantees that Party members continue to play a production active and exemplary role, and work together with the masses to complete the Seven-Year Plan.

    以身作则发挥带头作用  团结群众建设共产主义
    苏联共产党员站在生产竞赛第一线
    各行各业职工信心百倍争取五年完成七年计划
    本报莫斯科12日电  在全面展开共产主义建设时期，在争取提前完成七年计划的全国规模生产竞赛中，苏联共产党员奋勇地站在第一线。目前，不论在各工业企业、建设工地，或者在农庄、牧场，数以万计的苏共党员都以身作则，紧密团结广大群众，同心协力地实现着党的雄伟的共产主义建设任务。
    苏共党员一向是实现党的各种号召的尖兵。党的第二十一次代表大会以后，全苏各级党组织和各地党员积极带头响应党代表大会的决议，全国出现了一个政治热情和劳动热情空前高涨的新局面。各个生产战线上的党员首先起来提出力争提前完成七年计划的保证。与此同时，在党员带头下掀起了如火如荼的为提前完成七年计划第一年生产任务的竞赛运动。全苏著名的顿巴斯煤矿工人、共产党员马马伊和柯里琴科是最早提出七年计划五年完成的保证的，并以此向全国挑战，受到各行各业职工们的热烈支持。现在，马马伊领导的生产队，正有效地实现着自己的生产计划。全队第一季度的生产计划已超额完成。他们工作的“北方”二号矿井原定每人每班超计划多产两吨半煤，结果今年第一季度平均每人每班超额增产三点一吨，为国家增产了大量煤炭。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、基辅等城市的上万个工厂都在党员带头下参加了生产竞赛，并都超计划5％到10％左右完成了第一季度生产任务。明斯克重型汽车厂炼钢工人、共产党员巴拉什金每班超额完成生产计划。他原计划每班出钢十三吨，实际上现在他每班的产量已达到十六吨到十八吨，许多天竟超过了二十三吨。他的干劲提高了全车间工人生产热情，车间生产计划完成得非常出色。在哈萨克斯坦古里耶夫新石油区的广阔钻井工地上，老钻工、共产党员马克努托夫不仅超额完成了自己的生产任务，而且踏遍了全区每个钻井工地，帮助大家一起克服困难，完成提前出油的任务。莫斯科州“向共产主义前进”农庄在开始繁忙的春播时，拖拉机手列沃夫的副手突然病倒了，眼看要影响春播了，庄员们都很着急。此时拖拉机手列沃夫没有任何犹豫立刻向党表示决心：一个人做好两个人的事。他说：“我是共产党员，我就能这样工作。”这样，他早出夜归，第一天播种了十四公顷，第二天增为十七公顷，第三天增至十九公顷，超过了两人的工作量。这件事例鼓舞了全体庄员，使他们发挥了更大的干劲。现在，在生产战线上，苏共党员发挥模范带头作用的事例到处可见可闻。苏共党员在共产主义建设战线上的这种忘我劳动的精神，已成为鼓舞全苏劳动人民信心百倍地实现共产主义建设计划的重要力量。
    同时，苏共党员也是争取“共产主义劳动队”、“共产主义突击手”运动的积极参加者和领导者。目前，全苏已有六万多个争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的生产组织，绝大部分劳动队都有优秀的党员参加领导，他们正与全体队员们一起，实现着“按共产主义方式来工作、学习和生活”的口号。
    为了更好地发挥党员的模范带头作用，为了更密切党员与非党群众的联系。最近时期，苏共各级党组织，尤其是党的基层组织工作比先前显得更为生动、活跃、具体和多样了。各基层组织普遍地经常召开党的公开会议，并在党员的参加和领导下组织了各种各样活动：例如车间生产会议、生产技术革新小组、党与非党群众个别谈心会、政治课学习、共青团晚会、工厂文化大学，等等。党组织和党员运用这种集会，广泛地吸引群众参加对工厂的生产和生活等重大问题的讨论，吸引非党群众提出批评，督促党员努力，从而促进了生产，加强了团结。例如南乌拉尔机器制造厂，今年第一季度接到了赶制一批特种钢材设备的任务。这个任务是复杂而紧急的，当时，车间党组织立刻召开了党的公开大会，让大家讨论如何完成任务。大会上党员和非党群众都踊跃发言，提出了许多好办法，结果，任务按期完成了。在这个工厂的钢板车间举行的一次党的公开会议上，到会的人提出了三十多条合理化建议，使钢板生产效率提高20％。三个月来，在党员带头下，全厂提出三百三十八条合理化建议，为国家节省了一百五十多万卢布，超额完成了第一季度生产计划。哈尔科夫许多工厂举行的党员和非党群众个别谈心会，广泛讨论如何发掘生产潜力的问题，获得了很好的效果。一个月来，仅哈尔科夫市的列宁区各工厂党员和非党职工就提出了一万二千多条合理化建议，改进了生产技术，大大提高了劳动生产率。随着党员自觉的劳动热情的澎湃高涨，各级党组织工作也更为深入细致，这就保证党员不断发挥生产积极性和模范作用，与群众一起，共同努力完成七年计划。
