Promoting rapid germination, abundant and early tillering, fast elongation, strong and thick sugarcane stalks, and uniform growth are important standards for good field management. From the perspective of sugarcane development and growth, processing should be done sooner rather than later. Early processing can make the sugarcane seedlings strong and provide a foundation for later growth; if the seedlings are not strong and the stalks are weak, even if later processing compensates, they will often form thick upper sections and thin lower sections, which are prone to lodging.

To process sugarcane, it is essential to ensure full seedling emergence. According to our experience in growing sugarcane over the years, the sugarcane field must maintain a certain amount of moisture. This year, there is a relatively large amount of sugarcane planted, and the plots are relatively large, making them prone to drought. Some sugarcane fields are also relatively dry when planting, so frequent watering is necessary to promote sugarcane rooting and emergence. After the sugarcane emerges, it is necessary to water again at an appropriate time, depending on the climate and soil conditions.

Sugarcane is a fertilizer-tolerant crop, especially during the peak tillering to elongation stages, when it requires more fertilizer. According to the experience of Jingdong County, after the second watering, it is necessary to seize the time to topdress and mound the soil, applying at least 10,000 jin of livestock manure per mu; the second topdressing is best done with fast-acting fertilizers such as night soil and oil cake, and should be applied around the Dragon Boat Festival. After applying fertilizer, the second round of soil cultivation and root mounding should be carried out immediately, because this is the rainy season, and if there is enough water and fertilizer, the seedlings will grow very quickly. The amount of fertilizer applied should also be adjusted according to the crop's growth stage, with the amount applied during the peak tillering to elongation stages accounting for 60% to 70% of the total topdressing amount.

When the sugarcane seedlings grow to five or six inches high, they are most susceptible to sugarcane borers, especially ratoon sugarcane which is more threatened by borers. Therefore, it is necessary to control borers early to ensure high sugarcane yields. In addition to preventive measures before planting, artificial and chemical control methods should be adopted to continuously eliminate them. If withered heart seedlings are found, the withered heart should be removed immediately, leaving the green leaves to facilitate the growth of side buds. After removing the withered heart, various methods should be used to kill the insects inside. Early prevention and control should also be carried out for "sugarcane turtles" and "cotton aphids."

In addition, weeds grow very quickly after the rain, so timely weeding and drainage work must also be carried out.

    种蔗有方
    ——云南蔗农谈田间管理经验
    促进甘蔗发芽快，分蘖多和早，伸长快，蔗茎粗壮，生长整齐，是田间管理搞得好的重要标准。从甘蔗的发育成长来看，加工宜早不宜迟。早加工，能使甘蔗的幼苗肥壮，为后期的成长打下基础；如果幼苗不壮，蔗茎瘦弱，既使后期加工弥补，也往往形成上节粗下节细，容易倒伏。
    进行甘蔗加工，首先要保证甘蔗全苗。根据我们历年来种甘蔗的经验，蔗地要保持一定的水份。今年，田里种的甘蔗比较多，地块比较大，容易受旱，有的蔗地在栽甘蔗的时候，又比较干燥，所以要勤润水，以促进甘蔗生根、出苗。在甘蔗出苗以后的适当时期，还要根据气候、土质情况，再润水一次。
    甘蔗是一种耐肥作物，特别是它在分蘖盛期到伸长期这一阶段需肥更多。根据景东县的经验，在甘蔗第二次润水以后就要抓紧追肥、壅土，每亩至少要追一万斤牲畜肥；第二次追肥最好施大粪、油枯等速效性肥料。而且要赶在端阳节前后施下。追了肥又要立即进行第二道的培土、壅根。因为这个时期正是雨季，水份足，如果肥料够，苗稞成长就非常快。在施肥数量上还要按作物成长时期掌握适当的比例，一般在分蘖盛期到伸长期的施肥量，要占总追肥量的60％到70％以上。
    当蔗苗长到五、六寸高的时候，最容易发生蔗螟。特别是宿根蔗受螟虫的威胁更大。所以要及早治螟，才能保证甘蔗高产。防治蔗螟的办法，除了种植前的预防工作以外，还应当采取人工和药械防治办法不断除治。如发现枯心苗要马上抽去枯心，保留青叶，便于侧芽生长。扯除枯心以后应该用各种办法把里面的虫毒杀。对于“蔗龟”、“棉蚜虫”也要及早防治。
    此外，雨水来了以后，杂草生长很快，还要及时进行薅锄、排水工作。
