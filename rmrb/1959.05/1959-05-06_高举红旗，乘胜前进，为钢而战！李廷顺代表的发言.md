Hold High the Red Flag, Advance in Victory, Fight for Steel!
Speech by Representative Li Tingshun

Chairman, Fellow Representatives:
    I wholeheartedly support the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am determined to implement them resolutely.
    We steelworkers express our boundless indignation towards the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper-class clique for launching an armed rebellion betraying the unification of the motherland. Tibet is China's Tibet, and no foreign forces are allowed to interfere. We warn the imperialists and Indian ambitious individuals to immediately cease their conspiracy activities. All provocative actions will meet with shameful failure.
    I am a steelworker from the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Ansteel). I would like to report to the congress on the determination and drive of our Ansteel steelworkers in holding high the red flag of the General Line, advancing in victory, vigorously engaging in mass movements centered on technological innovation and revolution, deeply carrying out the high-yield, high-quality Red Flag competition, and resolutely striving to exceed the national target of 18 million tons of steel.

    In Last Year's Battle for Steel, We Forged Steel and Tempered People
    1958 was an extraordinary year. In this year, the socialist construction of the motherland rode the east wind and broke through thousands of waves. All fronts achieved unprecedented great leaps forward. Ansteel's steelmaking plants, like those across the country, under the wise leadership and cordial concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees and the company Party committee, and with the help of Soviet experts and fraternal factories, also achieved great results in the battle to seize 10.7 million tons of steel for the country. Steel production increased by 44.3 percent compared to 1957, equivalent to 60 percent of the total increase during the First Five-Year Plan. This was an unprecedented great leap forward!
    In the great 1958 battle for steel, we underwent a severe revolutionary test. We forged steel and tempered people. Our steelmaking plant grew larger and larger, and the steelworkers grew stronger and stronger in battle. When the Party Central Committee solemnly put forward the great call for 10.7 million tons of steel to the people of the whole country in August last year, how excited and moved we were! Because we are fighting on the forefront of the steel industry, shouldering a very important and glorious task in the 10.7 million tons of steel! We were all high in spirit, full of energy, breaking superstitions, liberating our minds, working hard and cleverly, vigorously carrying out technological revolution, constantly breaking through the old balance in production, production indicators leaped again and again, and the labor enthusiasm surged higher and higher. The factory staff stayed by the furnace to sleep and ate by the furnace. They worked without regard to remuneration and worked without regard to conditions. The factory is home, and time is steel! No matter what difficulties were placed on the road ahead, they could not stop our soaring enthusiasm.

    Seizing Every Second, Every Ounce, Getting Steel from Time
    In order to overfulfill the 1958 steel leap forward plan, we victoriously broke through four difficulties in the battle for steel. In carrying out the three-in-one technological innovation competition movement of more loading, faster refining, and maintenance of the furnace body, we first focused on expanding the loading capacity of open-hearth furnaces. After hard work, the loading capacity of the open-hearth furnace increased from 222 tons in the first half of the year to 273.9 tons in the second half of the year.
    After expanding the loading capacity, if the smelting time was not shortened, the goal of high yield could not be achieved. Therefore, we put forward the battle cry of "Seizing every second, every ounce, getting steel from time" and carried out rapid steelmaking. After No. 16 open-hearth furnace created a rapid steelmaking record of five minutes and forty seconds, a high tide of learning from the experience of No. 16 open-hearth furnace was immediately set off throughout the plant. The thermal system was revised, the flue suction was increased, tar spraying equipment was installed, and with the help of the laboratory, methods such as soft melting carbon increase and hard melting carbon decrease were successfully tested, shortening the average smelting time of each open-hearth furnace by more than one hour. The Youth Friendship Furnace refined more than 320 furnaces of rapid steelmaking throughout the year, and also created a new record of eight furnaces in two days and five minutes and thirty seconds for refining one furnace of steel.
    The loading capacity was expanded and the smelting time was shortened, but it brought new difficulties to furnace body maintenance. Slag running with molten steel on the roller track, collapse of the front and rear walls, seriously threatened production. Therefore, we quickly launched a furnace protection movement. Everyone cared about the open-hearth furnace, and everyone used their brains and hands. The workers automatically organized a shock team, carried out communist great collaboration, and implemented the "four no's" (do not leave when catching up with steel tapping after get off work, do not leave when repairing the furnace, do not leave when plugging the door sill, and do not leave until the work of this shift is completed). At this time, the atmosphere in the factory became more and more active. The more intense everyone's labor was, the closer the collaboration was, and the greater the enthusiasm was. Truly, production increased day by day, and poetry was all over the walls. When the average daily output of our No. 2 Steelmaking Plant went straight from more than 4,000 tons to over 5,000 tons and approached the 6,000-ton mark, the workers wrote poems: "Our factory has many heroes, steel will surpass England in the blink of an eye, our factory has many poets, writing poems with molten steel, the molten steel shining like the Milky Way, the singing loud like gongs and drums, poetry lighting the fire in our hearts, the molten steel will be more than the sea." These poems reflected our great leap forward, our lives, and our strong will.

    Marching Towards the Goal of a Thousand-Ton Furnace and a Ten-Thousand-Ton Plant
    After several battles, the operating rate and steel production of the open-hearth furnace were greatly improved. But new imbalances appeared. Other sections could not keep up with the needs of the open-hearth furnace, the auxiliary equipment was insufficient, especially the ingot crane could not be turned around. Therefore, each section launched a technological innovation and great collaboration movement with the content of "Guaranteeing more steel from the open-hearth furnace, not delaying the open-hearth furnace for a minute or a second." After the efforts of the three-way combination of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, everyone worked together. In less than half a month, they designed and installed a ground casting machine (replacing the ingot crane). At the same time, they also tapped the potential of the equipment, such as: increasing the load of the original crane and the capacity of the molten steel ladle; accelerating the turnover of the molten steel ladle, so that the previous turnover of nineteen molten steel ladles and two slag ladles per shift jumped to twenty-eight molten steel ladles and four slag ladles per shift. The ingot workers also cleared the "slag mountain" that had been piled up for a long time, making the site a "ball field." All this created favorable conditions for more loading, faster refining, and safe production of open-hearth furnaces. Therefore, steel production soared. The workers wrote poems again: "The central instructions are kept in mind, the steel commander has boundless power, yesterday broke seventy-five hundred, today we want to pass eight thousand, eight thousand eight thousand is not difficult to climb, each open-hearth furnace stares wide eyes, as long as the whole plant strives together, the molten steel will flow endlessly." Soon, we released a high-yield satellite of 8,811 tons per day, and put forward the bold slogan of "Marching towards the 'thousand-ton furnace' and the 'ten-thousand-ton plant.'" Our steelworkers are like this, with soaring enthusiasm and a spirit of continuous revolution, breaking through one level after another, one victory after another, overfulfilling the task of 1958.
    1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in our country. As Premier Zhou said in his report: "We should continue to leap forward on the basis of the great victory of 1958, along the road opened up in 1958, and strive for greater victories on all fronts in 1959." We steelworkers are determined to use twelve minutes of measures and twenty-four minutes of effort to continuously overcome the difficulties in the advance, find ways to tap potential, and fight for the nation's overfulfillment of 18 million tons of steel!

    Simultaneous Emphasis on More Loading and Faster Refining, Furnace Body Maintenance First
    In the first quarter, under the leadership of the Party Committee, we summarized and applied the production experience of "political command first, two participations, one reform, and three combinations," launching mass movements, and "simultaneous emphasis on more loading and faster refining, with furnace body maintenance first" in 1958. We put forward three barriers for furnace body maintenance, slag removal, and technical operation, and launched a high-yield, high-quality, and economical movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation. Ansteel's steel production in the first quarter increased by 44.9 percent compared to the same period last year, and the newly put into production "Open-hearth King" is exerting its power. The utilization coefficient of the Youth Solidarity Furnace has been increased to 10.85 tons. We have achieved great results in the first quarter, but for the realization of the annual leap forward plan, this is only a forward battle, firing the first shot. To successfully complete this year's task, we must make greater efforts, seize the time, and implement measures. The battle cry of our No. 2 Steelmaking Plant is: Revolutionary enthusiasm breaks through the sky, vowing to break through the three major barriers to production, fulfilling the leap forward plan, ensuring quality and safety, the Red Flag competition is full of praise, we will not give up until we reach our goal, everyone strives to enter Beijing to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    Good Iron Must be Good Iron, Good Steel Must be Good Steel, Steel Must be Shaped, and Materials Must be Diverse
    In order to achieve a greater leap forward target in 1959, our technical measures are mainly: continuing to tap the potential of equipment and expand the loading capacity. Two open-hearth furnaces have recently been successfully rebuilt, increasing their original design capacity by 80 percent. We have also learned from the advanced experience of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), and changed the large fixed open-hearth furnace to three-slot steel tapping. With the increase of loading capacity, without national investment, we use waste materials, do it ourselves, and install another and transform one charging machine and four ground casting machines. As soon as possible to realize the mechanization of slag transportation, promote slag discharge behind the furnace, improve efficiency, and save manpower. Improve tar spraying equipment, widely use new technologies of carbon increase and carbon reduction and compressed air blowing. Improve raw material supply. Humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal factories, strengthen technical management, improve technical level, improve the quality of steel, and must achieve the requirements of "Good iron must be good iron, good steel must be good steel, steel must be shaped, and materials must be diverse."

    Fellow Representatives: This year is the tenth anniversary of our great motherland. Under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the 650 million people of the whole country are going all out, aiming high, and fighting heroically for a new great leap forward this year. We, all the staff and workers of Ansteel, are determined to join hands with the people of the whole country, continue to hold high the red flag of the General Line, advance in victory, vigorously engage in technological revolution, vigorously carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, make greater contributions to the nation's over-fulfillment of 18 million tons of steel this year, and dedicate ourselves to the National Day!
    Long live our great motherland!
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the wise and great leader Chairman Mao!

　　高举红旗，乘胜前进，为钢而战！
　　李廷顺代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我衷心地拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我们炼钢工人，对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，发动背叛祖国统一的武装叛乱，表示无比的愤恨。西藏是中国的西藏，绝不允许任何外国势力的干涉。我们警告帝国主义者和印度野心家，立即停止阴谋活动。一切挑拨行为，都要遭到可耻的失败。
    我是鞍钢第二炼钢厂的炼钢工人，下面向大会汇报一下我们鞍钢炼钢工人高举总路线的红旗，乘胜前进，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，深入开展高产优质红旗竞赛，坚决为全国超额完成一千八百万吨钢的决心和干劲。
    去年夺钢战斗中，炼了钢也炼了人
    一九五八年是不平凡的一年。在这一年里，祖国的社会主义建设，乘东风破万里浪，在各个战线上都获得了史无前例的大跃进。鞍钢的炼钢厂，和全国各地一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导与亲切关怀下，在省、市委和公司党委领导下，在苏联专家和各兄弟厂帮助下，在为全国夺取一千零七十万吨钢的大战中，也取得了巨大的成绩。钢的产量比一九五七年提高了百分之四十四点三，等于第一个五年计划期间增长总额的百分之六十，这是一个空前的大跃进！
    在伟大的一九五八年的夺钢战斗中，给了我们一次严重的革命考验，炼了钢，也炼了人。我们炼钢厂越长越大，炼钢工人也越战越强。当党中央在去年八月份向全国人民庄严地提出了一千零七十万吨钢的伟大号召的时候，我们的心情是多么的兴奋和激动！因为我们战斗在钢铁战线的最前线，担负着一千零七十万吨钢中十分重要和十分光荣的任务！我们个个斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，破除了迷信，解放了思想，苦干加巧干，大闹技术革命，不断地突破生产上的旧平衡，生产指标一跃再跃，劳动热潮一浪高过一浪。全厂职工守炉眠、伴炉餐，劳动不计报酬，工作不讲条件。工厂就是家，时间就是钢！不管前进的道路上摆着种种困难，挡不住我们的冲天干劲。
    分秒必争，斤两不少，向时间要钢
    为超额完成一九五八年钢的跃进计划，我们在夺钢大战中，胜利地冲破了四道难关。在开展多装、快炼、维护炉体三位一体的技术革新竞赛运动中，我们首先抓住了扩大平炉装入量。经过艰苦奋斗，平炉的装入量，便从上半年的二百二十二吨增加到下半年的二百七十三点九吨。
    扩大了装入量以后，如果冶炼时间不缩短，还是不能达到高产的目的。因此我们又提出了“分秒必争，斤两不少，向时间要钢”的战斗口号，开展快速炼钢。当十六号平炉创造了五点四十分钟的快速炼钢纪录以后，立刻在全厂范围内掀起了学习十六号平炉经验的高潮，并且修改了热工制度，提高了烟道吸力，安装了喷焦油设备，在试验室帮助下，试验成功软熔增炭、硬熔降炭等办法，使各个平炉的每炉熔炼时间平均缩短了一个多小时。青年友谊炉全年炼了三百二十多炉快速炼钢，还创造了二天出八炉和五点三十分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。
    装入量扩大了，熔炼时间也缩短了，但是给炉体维护带来了新的困难，跑渣带钢焊辊道，前后墙倒塌，严重地威胁着生产，于是我们又迅速地展开护炉运动，大家关心平炉，大家动脑动手。工人们自动地组织了突击队，开展共产主义大协作，实行四不走（下班时赶上出钢不走、补炉不走、堵夹门坎不走、本班的活干不完不走）。这时候，工厂里的气氛越来越活跃了。大家的劳动越紧张，协作就越紧密，干劲也越大。真是生产日日高，诗歌满墙飘。当我们第二炼钢厂的平均日产量由四千多吨，直破五千吨、接近六千吨大关时，工人写诗道：“我们工厂英雄多，钢铁转眼超英国，我们工厂诗人多，蘸着钢水写诗歌，钢水闪闪像银河，歌声朗朗赛锣鼓，诗歌点亮心中火，钢水要比海水多。”这些诗歌反映了我们的大跃进、我们的生活和我们的坚强意志。
    向千吨炉万吨厂的目标进军
    我们经过几次奋战，平炉的作业率和钢产量大大地提高了。但是又出现了新的不平衡，其它的工段跟不上平炉的需要，附属设备不足，特别是铸锭吊车周转不开，于是各个工段又开展了“保证平炉多出钢，不误平炉一分一秒”为内容的技术革新和大协作运动。经过领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的努力，大家在一起，不到半个月就设计、安装一台地浇机（替代铸锭吊车）。同时还挖掘了设备潜力，如：加大了原有吊车的负荷和钢水缶的容量；加速了钢水缶的周转，使过去每班周转钢水缶十九个，渣缶二次，跃进到每班周转钢水缶二十八个、渣缶四次。铸锭工人还清理了堆积了很久的“渣山”，使现场“球场化”。这一切都为平炉多装、快炼和安全生产创造了有利的条件。因此，钢的产量扶摇直上，工人们又写诗歌道：“中央指示记心间，钢帅力量大无边，昨天破了七千五，今天要过八千关，八千八千不难攀，个个平炉瞪大眼，只要全厂齐奋斗，钢水滔滔流不完”。不久，我们便放出了日产八千八百一十一吨的高产卫星，并且又提出了“向‘千吨炉’，‘万吨厂’进军”的豪迈口号。我们钢铁工人就是这样，以冲天的干劲、不断革命的精神，突破一关又一关，一个胜利接着一个胜利地超额完成了一九五八年的任务。
    一九五九年是我国更大更好更全面跃进的一年。正如周总理报告中说的：“我们应当在一九五八年的巨大胜利的基础上，沿着一九五八年所开辟的道路，继续跃进，争取一九五九年在各个战线上获得更大的胜利。”我们炼钢工人决心以十二分措施、二十四分干劲，不断战胜前进中的困难，千方百计挖掘潜力，为全国超额完成一千八百万吨钢而战！
    多装快炼并举，炉体维护先行
    第一季度里，在党委的领导下，总结和运用了一九五八年政治挂帅，两参一改三结合，大搞群众运动，“多装快炼并举，炉体维护先行”的生产经验，提出了炉体维护、清渣和技术操作等三道关口，开展了以技术革命和技术革新为中心内容的高产优质节约运动。鞍钢第一季度的钢产量比去年同期增长了百分之四十四点九，新投入生产的“平炉王”正在发挥威力。四月上半月的平均日产量又比第一季度增加了一千一百多吨。青年团结炉的利用系数，已提高到十点八五吨。我们在第一季度取得了很大成绩，但是对实现全年跃进计划来说，这仅是一个前哨战，打响了第一炮。要胜利完成今年任务，我们必须作更大的努力，抓紧时机，实现措施。我们第二炼钢厂的战斗口号是：革命干劲冲破天，誓破生产三大关，跃进计划定完成，保证质量和安全，红旗竞赛满堂红，不达目的心不甘，人人争取进北京，迎接国庆十周年。
    铁要好铁，钢要好钢，钢要成材，材要多种
    为了实现一九五九年更大的跃进指标，我们的技术措施主要是：继续挖掘设备潜力，扩大装入量。有两座平炉已经在最近改建成功，比原设计能力提高百分之八十。我们还学习了太钢的先进经验，将大型固定式平炉改为三槽出钢；随着装入量的提高，我们不用国家投资，利用废料，自己动手，再安装一台和改造一台装料机、四台地浇机；尽快实现运渣机械化，推行炉后放渣，提高效率，节省人力；改进喷焦油设备，广泛运用增炭降炭和吹压缩空气的新技术；改进原料供应；虚心学习苏联和各兄弟厂的先进经验，加强技术管理，提高技术水平，提高钢的质量，一定达到“铁要好铁，钢要好钢，钢要成材，材要多种”的要求。
    各位代表：今年是我们伟大的祖国国庆十周年，全国六亿五千万人民正在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为今年新的大跃进而英勇奋斗。我们鞍钢全体职工决心和全国人民一起，继续高举总路线的红旗，乘胜前进，大闹技术革命，大搞增产节约运动，为全国今年超额完成一千八百万吨钢作出更大的贡献，向国庆节献礼！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    英明伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
