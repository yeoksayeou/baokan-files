Three Keys to a Bumper Harvest of Flue-Cured Tobacco
Commentator of this newspaper

Flue-cured tobacco is one of China's important industrial raw material crops. Increasing the production of flue-cured tobacco not only meets the needs of the vast domestic population, but can also be exported to exchange for essential construction materials to support national construction. According to surveys in key tobacco-producing counties in Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and other provinces, although tobacco fields generally account for only about 10% of the cultivated land area, their economic income accounts for about 50% of the total agricultural income. Therefore, it is also closely related to increasing income and improving the lives of farmers in tobacco-producing areas. Therefore, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party stipulated in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes": "With the solution of the grain problem, the proportion of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, hemp, silk, soybeans, oilseeds, sugar crops, tea, tobacco leaves, and medicinal materials in all agricultural production should be gradually increased."

This year, the national flue-cured tobacco production requires an increase of 10 million dan over last year without expanding the planting area. This is an arduous and glorious task. To accomplish this glorious task, we must focus on three central links: transplanting, management, and curing.

From the current situation of flue-cured tobacco production, the seedling cultivation area in various regions this year has increased by one-third compared to last year, and the seedlings in the nursery stage have basically not suffered from diseases and pests. By the end of April, Henan Province had completed 50% of the early tobacco transplanting area, and individual counties in Guizhou Province had transplanted 80%, which was about half a month earlier than in previous years. This is a favorable aspect. However, the early tobacco transplanting work has not yet ended. In particular, late tobacco, which accounts for about half of the national tobacco field area, is still in the seedling stage. Therefore, it is extremely important to seize the time to transplant early tobacco, take measures to prevent late tobacco seedlings from suffering from diseases and insect pests, and ensure that there are sufficient healthy seedlings for late tobacco transplanting to ensure the completion of the state's planned planting area. Only by first completing the planting plan can we create the minimum conditions for completing this year's flue-cured tobacco production increase plan.

As for tobacco field management, the promotion of advanced technology is the fundamental guarantee for increasing tobacco leaf yield. In 1958, among various yield-increasing measures, it was confirmed that leaving sucker tobacco and second-crop tobacco were the most effective yield-increasing measures. Generally, sucker tobacco and second-crop tobacco from high-yield fields account for about 40% of the total yield. The masses praised it as "one season of tobacco leaves, three seasons of harvest." However, last year's experience proved that the better the first-crop tobacco grows, the more significant the yield increase effect of the second-crop tobacco and sucker tobacco. Therefore, whether the goal of one season of tobacco leaves and three seasons of harvest can be achieved depends on good tobacco field management. Because flue-cured tobacco is a crop that uses leaves, it requires a particularly large amount of water and fertilizer. Especially for sucker tobacco, which has a short growth period, it is necessary to apply fast-acting fertilizers to achieve the effect of more and larger leaves. This year, water conservancy conditions in various regions have been greatly improved. Therefore, preparing sufficient fertilizer for tobacco fields has become the central task in the process of tobacco field management. In addition to applying more farmyard manure and soil fertilizer to promote the vigorous growth of the first-crop sucker tobacco and lay the foundation for a bumper harvest of sucker tobacco, we must also plan to arrange a certain amount of chemical fertilizer for cultivating sucker tobacco on the basis of the existing supply of commercial fertilizers, so that it can fully exert its yield-increasing effect.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of flue-cured tobacco, we must also make preparations for tobacco leaf curing. Now it is less than a month away from the time of harvesting flue-cured tobacco leaves, so we must seize the time to make all preparations and strive to "produce one piece, cure one piece, cure every piece well, and not lose a single piece." The main problems in tobacco leaf curing this year are the insufficient number of curing barns and the insufficient and untimely supply of coal, grate bars, hemp ropes, and other materials needed for curing tobacco. To solve this problem, on the one hand, we must try our best to supply tobacco curing coal and build curing barns in a timely manner, and on the other hand, we must actively promote advanced experience in saving coal and improving the utilization rate of curing barns. According to the experience of Xuchang County in Henan Province and Yidu County in Shandong Province, in areas where tobacco fields are concentrated, using large curing barns with about 10,000 poles can save 30% to 50% of coal and 70% to 80% of labor compared to the existing general small curing barns. Adopting yellow hanging curing can greatly shorten the curing time and increase the utilization rate of curing barns by one time. These methods are in line with the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. We must actively promote them and do a good job in technical teaching.

In addition, as people's living standards gradually improve, not only exports and cities need high-quality cigarettes, but also rural areas need better cigarettes. Therefore, in promoting various yield-increasing measures this year, we must avoid the practice of only focusing on improving yield per unit area and not paying attention to improving quality, so as to ensure a double bumper harvest of tobacco leaf yield and quality.

    烤烟丰收的三个关键
    本报评论员
    烤烟是我国重要的工业原料作物之一。增产烤烟不仅是满足国内广大人民的需要，并且可以出口换回必需的建设物资，支援国家建设。根据河南、山东、安徽等省重点产烟县的调查：烟田面积一般虽只占耕地面积10％左右，但经济收入则占农业总收入的50％左右，因此，它又与产烟区农民增加收入改善生活有密切关系。所以党的八届六中全会在关于人民公社若干问题的决议中曾经规定：“随着粮食问题的解决，应当逐步提高棉、麻、蚕丝、大豆、油料、糖料、茶叶、烟叶、药材等工业原料作物在全部农业生产当中所占的比重”。
    今年全国烤烟生产要求在不扩大播种面积的基础上比去年增产一千万担。这是个艰巨而光荣的任务。完成这个光荣的任务，必须抓好移栽、管理、烘烤三个中心环节。
    从当前烤烟生产情况看：今年各地育苗面积比去年扩大三分之一，烟苗在苗床期基本没有遭受病害；4月下旬河南省已完成早烟移栽面积的50％，贵州省个别县已移栽了80％，都比往年提早半个月左右。这是有利的一面。但是早烟移栽工作并没有结束，特别是占全国烟田面积一半左右的晚烟，还在育苗阶段，因此抓紧早烟的移栽，并采取措施，防止晚烟烟苗遭受病虫害，使晚烟移栽时有足够的健壮烟苗，保证完成国家的播种面积计划是一个十分重要的问题。只有首先完成了播种计划，才为完成今年烤烟增产计划创造了起码的条件。
    做为烟田管理，推广先进技术是提高烟叶产量的根本保证。1958年在各项增产措施中，证实了留杈烟、留二茬烟是一项最有效的增产措施。一般丰产田的杈烟和二茬烟约占全部产量的40％左右。群众赞誉为“一季烟叶、三季收成”。但是去年经验证明：正茬烟生长得愈好，二茬烟和杈烟的增产效果也愈显著。因此能否达到一季烟叶，三季收成的目的，关键在于作好烟田管理。由于烤烟是利用叶子的作物，对水、肥的需要特别多，尤其是杈烟生长期短，还必须施用速效性的肥料，才能得到叶多、叶大的效果。今年各地水利条件已经有了很大的改善，因此为烟田准备足够的肥料，就成为烟田管理过程中的中心工作。除了多施农家肥料和土化肥，促使正杈烟的旺盛生长，为杈烟丰收打下基础以外，更要有计划地在现有商品肥料供应量的基础上，为培育杈烟安排一定数量的化学肥料，使它充分发挥增产效果。
    为了保证烤烟的丰产丰收，还要作好烟叶烘烤的准备工作。现在离收烤烟叶的时间不到一个月了，要抓紧时间作好一切准备工作，力争作到“生产一片，烘烤一片，片片烤好，不丢一片”。今年烟叶烘烤上的主要问题是烤房不够和烤烟所需的煤炭、炉条、麻绳等物资供应不足和不及时。解决这个问题，一方面要努力设法及时供应烤烟煤和修建烤房，一方面还要积极推广节约用煤和提高烤房利用率的先进经验。据河南许昌县和山东益都县的经验：烟田集中的地区，利用万竿左右的大烤房，比现有的一般小烤房可节省煤炭30％—50％，节省劳力70％—80％；采用挂黄烘烤可以大大缩短烘烤时间，提高烤房利用率一倍。这些办法都是符合多快好省的方针的，要积极提倡和作好技术传授。
    此外由于人民生活水平逐渐提高了，不仅出口和城市需要品质好的卷烟，就是农村也需要一部较好的卷烟了。因此今年在推广各项增产措施中，要避免只重视提高单位面积产量，不重视提高品质的作法，以保证烟叶产量、质量的双丰收。
