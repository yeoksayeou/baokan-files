Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam made its Ninth Interim Report on March 10th. The report covers the period from May 1, 1958, to January 31, 1959. The report, divided into seven chapters, was signed by the Chairman of the Commission from India, Ansari, the Commissioner from Poland, Goranski, and the Commissioner from Canada, Erichson-Brown.

    The report states in the first chapter that an investigation report by a special team of the International Commission in Cambodia confirmed that South Vietnamese troops had invaded Stung Treng Province in Cambodia.

    The report addresses the issue of the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone in the second chapter. The report states that, according to reports from the Commission's team stationed in the demilitarized zone, several incidents occurred involving individuals holding "passes" issued by the "Governor" of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam illegally entering the southern demilitarized zone. The International Commission pointed out to the South Vietnamese authorities that this practice was inappropriate and noted that the South Vietnamese authorities had violated Article 7 of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities thirteen times.

    The report also points out that since the withdrawal of the French military delegation from the Joint Commission of the two sides of the ceasefire on April 15, 1958, the Joint Commission has been unable to resume its activities due to the refusal of the South Vietnamese authorities to participate. This has made it impossible to implement the clauses of the agreement related to the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone, especially Articles 7, 8, and 9, which aim to maintain the demilitarized nature of the demilitarized zone to prevent the recurrence of hostilities. Therefore, the Commission has reported this situation to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference.

    Regarding the issue of democratic freedoms (Chapter 3), the report points out that the South Vietnamese authorities' refusal to fulfill Article 14(c) concerning democratic freedoms has not changed. The Commission expresses its regret in this regard. The report notes that the South Vietnamese authorities have not responded to the 396 accusations (including 1,047 incidents) mentioned in the Seventh Interim Report concerning accusations by the Vietnamese People's Army and the people in the South that the South Vietnamese authorities violated Article 14(c), persecuted former resistance members, and the people, nor have they responded to the 87 accusations (including the Hoi An prison incident) during the period covered by the Eighth Interim Report. During the period covered by this report, the Vietnamese People's Army submitted 49 accusations, including the well-known Tran Thi Ly case and the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre on December 1, 1958. The South Vietnamese authorities have not provided any explanation for all of the above events. The report also points out that the majority of the commissioners believe that the practice of the South Vietnamese authorities in the Vich 川 area during the period of 1954 to 1955 to register and control former resistance members separately after the ceasefire was equivalent to violating Article 14(c) regarding not discriminating against former resistance members.

    Regarding the issue of prisoners of war and detained civilians (Chapter 4), the report points out that the Commission had previously recommended that the South Vietnamese authorities release a detained civilian who should be released according to the agreement, but this was not accepted by the South Vietnamese authorities. The majority of the commissioners believe that this was a violation of Article 21 of the agreement (regarding prisoners of war and detained civilians) and decided to raise this matter with the participating countries of the Geneva Conference in accordance with Article 43 of the agreement. The report points out that five people detained by the South Vietnamese authorities were proven to be detained civilians, and it was considered that if the South Vietnamese authorities continued to detain them, it would be a violation of Article 21 of the agreement. Therefore, the Commission recommended that they be released and handed over to the Vietnamese People's Army. The South Vietnamese authorities have not implemented this decision. In addition, twenty-six detained civilians were illegally released by the South Vietnamese authorities and the French military authorities without being handed over to the Vietnamese People's Army. The Commission pointed out that this is not in accordance with Article 21(c) of the agreement.

    Regarding the issue of prohibiting the entry of new troops, new military personnel, weapons, and ammunition into Vietnam, as well as military bases (Chapter 5), the report points out that the South Vietnamese authorities have restricted the inspection activities of the Commission's fixed teams stationed in South Vietnam, even requiring the teams to notify the South Vietnamese authorities 24 hours in advance, and sometimes even 48 hours in advance, each time they went out to perform inspection tasks. This in effect made it impossible for the teams to effectively perform their tasks. The majority of the commissioners decided to notify the South Vietnamese authorities that as long as the South Vietnamese authorities continued to adopt this attitude, the Commission's teams stationed in Da Nang, Nha Trang, Qui Nhon, Vung Tau, Tan Chau, and Saigon would be unable to conduct monitoring and supervision in many places in accordance with Article 36(d) of the agreement. The Commission also notified the participating countries of the Geneva Conference that the Commission's activities in this regard were being obstructed because the South Vietnamese authorities did not allow the Commission to exercise the monitoring and supervision it deemed necessary, and the Commission could only conduct monitoring and supervision in places permitted by the South Vietnamese authorities.

    The report states that after studying all reports and documents related to the US "Temporary Equipment Replacement Mission" (TERM, a military organization - Xinhua editor's note) stationed in South Vietnam, the Commission notified the South Vietnamese authorities that this mission should end its work by the end of June 1959, and should not exist thereafter, and its personnel should be withdrawn from South Vietnam. Regarding the US "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in South Vietnam, the South Vietnamese authorities have not yet provided the Commission with the information requested by the Commission regarding this advisory group, which is a violation of Article 25 of the agreement regarding cooperation with the Commission.

    During the period covered by the report, the Commission recorded 27 instances in which the South Vietnamese authorities did not comply with Article 16(f) of the agreement (which stipulates that the entry of military personnel into Vietnam should be reported in advance), six instances in which they did not comply with Article 17(e) of the agreement (which stipulates that the entry of weapons and war materials into Vietnam should be reported in advance), and four other instances in which the International Commission's teams were not allowed to conduct actual supervision.

    The report explains that the Commission reviewed the reports submitted by its various teams from January 7, 1956, to December 28, 1957, and saw that during this period, 2,002 US military personnel had entered South Vietnam, while only 1,243 had left South Vietnam. Thus, the number of US military personnel entering South Vietnam exceeded the number leaving by 759.

    In Chapter 6, the report points out that the Commission will continue to carry out the monitoring and supervision tasks stipulated in the Geneva Accords, but unless the Commission receives the cooperation of the two sides of the ceasefire, it will not be able to effectively carry out these tasks.

    The report concludes by saying that there has been no progress in the political settlement stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and consultations between the North and the South to achieve national elections have not been held. The Commission hopes that this important issue will receive the attention of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and the two chairmen, and hopes that they will take effective measures to resolve this important issue stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, and to resolve the difficulties that hinder the Commission from performing its tasks in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

    越南国际委员会第九次临时报告证实
    美国和南越当局严重违反日内瓦协议
    有关方面必须采取措施维护协议的执行
    新华社15日讯　越南国际监察和监督委员会3月10日作出了第九次临时报告。这项报告所涉及的期间是1958年5月1日到1959年1月31日。报告共分七章，是由委员会的印度主席安萨里、波兰委员高兰斯基、加拿大委员艾里契逊—布朗签署的。
    报告在第一章中谈到，柬埔寨国际委员会的一个专门小组的调查报告证实南越军队曾经侵犯柬埔寨上丁省。
    报告在第二章谈到关于军事分界线和非军事区问题。报告说，据委员会驻非军事区小组报告，曾经发生数起持有南越广治省“省长”发出的“通行证”的人非法进入南部非军事区的事件。国际委员会曾经向南越当局指出，这种做法是不恰当的，并且指出南越当局曾经十三次违反关于停止敌对行动的协定第七条的规定。
    报告还指出，自从1958年4月15日法军代表团退出停战双方的联合委员会以后，由于南越当局的拒绝参加，已经使得联合委员会无法恢复活动，这样就使得协定中有关军事分界线和非军事区的条款，特别是第七、八、九等条款无法履行，而这些条款的目的在于维持非军事区的非军事性，以免敌对行动之再起。因此，委员会已经将这一情况报告日内瓦会议的两位主席。
    关于民主自由问题（第三章），报告指出，南越当局拒不履行关于民主自由的第十四条丙款的态度并没有改变。委员会对此表示遗憾。报告指出，南越当局对第七次临时报告所述的关于越南人民军方面和南部人民指控南越当局违反第十四条丙款、迫害前抗战人员和人民的三百九十六次指控（包括一千零四十七次事件）和第八次临时报告期间的八十七次指控（包括会安监牢事件）至今没有作出答复。在本报告涉及期间，越南人民军方面曾经提出四十九次指控，其中包括著名的陈氏李案件和1958年12月1日富利集中营惨案。南越当局对所有上述事件至今未作出任何交代。报告还指出，委员会的多数委员认为，1954年至1955年期间南越当局在停战以后在维川地区将前抗战人员单独地加以登记和管制的做法等于违反第十四条丙款关于不得对前抗战人员施加歧视的规定。
    关于战俘和被拘平民问题（第四章），报告指出，委员会以前曾经建议南越当局释放一名按协定规定应予释放的被拘平民，但未被南越当局所接受。委员会的多数委员认为这是一次违反协定第二十一条（关于战俘和被拘平民）的事件，并且决定根据协定第四十三条向日内瓦会议与会国提出此事。报告指出，有五名被南越当局拘留的人被证明是被拘平民身份，并且认为如果南越当局继续将他们拘留，是违反协定第二十一条的，因此委员会建议将他们释放，并且将他们交给越南人民军方面。南越当局还没有执行这一决定。此外还有二十六名被拘平民被南越当局和法军当局非法释放而没有交给越南人民军方面。委员会指出，这是不符合协定第二十一条丙款的。
    关于禁止新的部队、新的军事人员、武器和弹药进入越南以及军事基地问题（第五章），报告指出，南越当局对委员会驻在南越的各个固定小组的视察活动加以限制，竟要求各小组在每次外出执行视察任务时，在二十四小时前，有时甚至要求在四十八小时前，通知南越当局，这样实际上使得各个小组无法有效地执行任务。委员会多数委员决定通知南越当局，只要南越当局继续采取这种态度，委员会驻在土伦、芽庄、归仁、头顿、新州和西贡的小组就无法依据协定第三十六条丁款对许多地方进行监察和监督。委员会并通知日内瓦会议与会各国：委员会在这方面的活动正受到阻挠，因为南越当局不让委员会行使它认为必要的监察和监督，而委员会只好在南越当局所允许的地方进行监察和监督。
    报告说，委员会研究了所有有关美国驻在南越的“临时装备更新团”（TERM，是一个军事性的机构——新华社编者按）的报告和文件以后，通知南越当局说，这个团应当在1959年6月底结束它的工作，此后即不应再存在，它的人员应撤出南越。关于美国驻南越的“军事援助顾问团”，委员会要求南越当局提供的有关这个顾问团的情况材料至今没有提供给委员会，这是违反协定第二十五条关于应同委员会合作的规定的。
    在报告涉及期间，委员会记载了南越当局二十七次没有遵守协定第十六条己款（这一条款规定军事人员进入越南应事先提出报告），六次没有遵守协定第十七条戊款（这一条款规定武器和作战物资进入越南应事先提出报告），另有四次不准国际委员会的小组进行实际监督。
    报告说明，委员会曾经审阅了它的各个小组自1956年1月7日至1957年12月28日期间提出的报告，看出在此期间曾有二千零二名美国军事人员进入南越，而离开南越的只有一千二百四十三名，这样，进入南越的美国军事人员比离开南越的多七百五十九名。
    在第六章里，报告指出，委员会将继续执行日内瓦协议所规定的监察和监督任务，但是除非委员会得到停战双方的合作，它无法有效地执行这些任务。
    报告最后说，在执行日内瓦会议最后宣言所规定的政治解决方面并无进展，北南双方为了实现全国选举的协商并未举行。委员会希望这一重要的问题能得到日内瓦会议的与会国和两位主席的注意，并且希望他们采取有效措施，以解决日内瓦会议最后宣言所规定的这一重要问题，并且解决阻挠委员会按照日内瓦协议执行它的任务的那些困难。
