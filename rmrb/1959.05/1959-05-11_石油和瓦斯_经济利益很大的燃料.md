Petroleum and Gas – Fuels with Great Economic Benefits
Hou Xianglin

Fuel provides heat and light to mankind and is the main source of all power. Whether for people's lives, industrial and agricultural production, or transportation, fuel is essential. Currently, the most widely used fuels in the world are coal, petroleum, and combustible gases (referred to as gas, including natural gas and combustible gases obtained through processing). Although the emergence of nuclear fuel has shown limitless prospects, the widespread use of nuclear fuel cannot be quickly realized due to limitations such as cost, technology, and protection. In the near future, coal, petroleum, and gas will still occupy an important position in the development of the national economy.

At present, although coal still occupies the first place in terms of quantity among fuels, in industrialized countries, the proportion of petroleum and gas in fuels has been increasing rapidly. In some individual countries, the proportion of petroleum and gas has jumped from 21% of the total fuel to 65% in the past thirty years or so; during the same period, the proportion of coal has dropped from 78% of the total fuel to 30%. The Soviet Union also proposed in its Seven-Year Plan to increase the proportion of petroleum and gas in the total fuel production from 31% to 51%, while the proportion of coal would correspondingly decrease from 60% to 43%. The reason why the Soviet Union and other industrially advanced countries attach importance to the development of petroleum and gas production is that petroleum and gas have many advantages in terms of extraction, transportation, and use, and their economic benefits are also very significant.

Petroleum and natural gas are hidden deep underground, and exploration work is relatively difficult; however, after an oil field or gas field is found, extraction is faster and the cost is lower. Currently, in China, it takes less than a few months to drill a well one to two thousand meters deep, with an investment of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, and it can generally produce more than 1,000 tons of petroleum per year. Because oil can be sprayed out by the formation pressure itself, or pumped out by pumping units, it requires very little manpower, and the production cost per ton of petroleum is not much more expensive than coal; if compared by calorific value, the production costs of the two are even closer. In industrialized countries, due to higher labor costs, the production cost of coal is sometimes higher than that of petroleum. For example, in the Second Baku oil field in the Soviet Union, the production cost per ton of petroleum is only about one-third of that of ordinary coal. As for natural gas, because the output of gas wells is generally higher, the cost is even lower than that of petroleum. Therefore, Comrade Khrushchev mentioned in his report on the Seven-Year Plan that replacing coal with natural gas and petroleum could save a total of more than 125 billion rubles in seven years.

Moreover, petroleum and gas can be transported by pipelines. A six-hundred-millimeter diameter oil pipeline can transport 10 million tons of petroleum per year. Compared with a railway with the same capacity of transporting 10 million tons of oil per year, the investment in building an oil pipeline is about half that of the railway, and the transportation cost is about 40% of that of the railway.

The most important advantages of petroleum and gas are also reflected in their performance. Natural petroleum (also called natural crude oil) is mainly a very complex hydrocarbon compound, including various substances that are gaseous, liquid, and solid at room temperature. Although petroleum can be burned, it is not of good quality when used directly as fuel. Therefore, it needs to be processed through processes such as distillation, cracking, and refining. The products are mainly gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and gas, all of which can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines. Because internal combustion engines have high thermal efficiency and are small in size and weight, transportation tools such as airplanes and automobiles generally use internal combustion engines as power. Even in railway transportation, the future trend is to replace steam locomotives with internal combustion locomotives. Petroleum products and gas are not only fuels for internal combustion engines, but also the best boiler and civil fuels. Because they can be completely burned, they have high thermal efficiency, are easy to operate, the temperature is easy to control, storage and transportation are convenient, and labor is saved. In many cases, these advantages are particularly prominent for gas. In industrialized countries, a considerable part of coal is generally not burned directly, but is used to produce various gases as fuel through dry distillation or gasification methods. The cost of gas produced from coal is much higher than that of natural gas. Therefore, it is more economical to vigorously develop natural gas and use it as fuel. However, in areas where there is no natural gas but there is coal, it is still beneficial to produce gas from coal. The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulated that while expanding the production of natural gas and petroleum gas, it also stipulated that the production of gas produced from coal and shale should be increased by 2.2 times.

The main petroleum products, in addition to fuel, also include lubricating oil, paraffin wax, asphalt, etc., which are important materials needed in the mechanical industry and construction industry, and have important significance in the national economy. In addition, in the process of petroleum processing, various chemical products or chemical raw materials are also produced, among which the petroleum gas generated during the processing process is the largest in quantity and low in cost, and is an important raw material for the development of the chemical industry, especially the organic synthesis industry, along with natural gas.

The economic advantages of using petroleum gas and natural gas to produce chemical products are very significant. For example, the production cost of a nitrogen fertilizer plant using natural gas as raw material is 40%-60% lower than that of a plant using coal as raw material, and the investment is also 25% lower than the latter. In addition to nitrogen fertilizer, carbon black and other chemical products, a wide variety of organic synthetic products can also be produced from petroleum gas and natural gas, such as synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, alcohol, detergents, and so on. The widespread use of these products can save a large amount of grain and oil for industrial use, allowing people to enjoy more food. Therefore, in recent years, the "petrochemical industry" has gradually formed a new and rapidly developing industrial sector.

The world's reserves of petroleum and natural gas account for only 1% of all fuels, but the amount extracted annually accounts for 38% of the total amount of fuel extracted. This is because petroleum and natural gas are hidden deep underground and are not easy to find, but once found, due to the low production cost, they are generally extracted in large quantities. While extracting, reserves are expanded, so the annual extraction rate is very high. With the continuous improvement of exploration technology and the increasing expansion of exploration scale, new oil fields and gas fields are also being discovered continuously. It is precisely because the Soviet Union has discovered some large oil fields and gas fields in recent years that it has been able to propose the magnificent plan of producing 230 to 240 million tons of petroleum and 150 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually in its Seven-Year Plan. Even some Western European countries that were previously considered to have few petroleum resources, such as Italy, France, and West Germany, have discovered some oil fields and gas fields after World War II. It can be seen that as long as technology is continuously developed and exploration is vigorously carried out, the deposits of petroleum and natural gas may be greatly increased, unlike what was predicted in the past based on old technology that petroleum resources would be quickly depleted.

Since liberation, China's petroleum and natural gas industry has achieved great growth in output and greatly expanded exploration scale due to the Party's attention and the efforts of all petroleum workers. The total footage drilled in 1958 alone (the sum of the depths of each well drilled) exceeded the total of the previous eight years, thus discovering twenty-two new oil fields and gas fields, creating favorable conditions for the great development of China's petroleum and gas industry. In addition to paying attention to the manufacture of fuels and lubricating oil, the petroleum processing industry has also paid attention to the production of chemical products, and relevant departments are making preparations for the development of the petrochemical industry from the aspects of scientific foundation and basic construction.

    石油和瓦斯——经济利益很大的燃料
    侯祥麟
    燃料给人类以热和光，是一切动力的主要来源。无论对于人民生活、工农业生产或交通运输，燃料都是必不可少的。目前世界上应用最广的燃料是煤炭、石油和可燃气体（简称瓦斯，包括天然气和加工所得的可燃气体）。虽然核子燃料的出现，展示了无限的前景，但由于成本、技术、防护等等问题的限制，广泛利用核子燃料还不能很快实现。从较近的前景来看，煤炭、石油和瓦斯在发展国民经济中仍占有重要的地位。
    目前，煤炭在燃料中，虽然在数量上仍占首位，但在工业发达的国家，石油和瓦斯在燃料中的比重已在急剧增加。有个别国家，在近三十余年里，石油和瓦斯的比重从燃料总量的21％跃进到65％；同一时期，煤的比重则从燃料总量的78％下降为30％。苏联在七年计划中，也提出要把石油和瓦斯在燃料生产总量中的比重由31％增加到51％，而煤的比重相应地从60％降到43％。苏联和其它工业先进国家之所以重视发展石油和瓦斯的生产，是因为石油和瓦斯在开采、运输和使用方面，都有很多优点，它的经济利益也是十分显著的。
    石油和天然气深藏地下，勘探工作比较困难；但找到油田或气田之后，开采较快，成本也较低。目前我国情况，钻一口一千至二千公尺深的井，用不到几个月，投资十万至二十万元，一般可年产石油一千多吨。因为油可以靠地层压力自己喷出来，或者用抽油泵抽出来，需要人力很少，每吨石油的生产成本和煤炭比起来贵不了多少；倘按发热量来比较，则两者的生产成本更为接近。工业发达的国家，由于人工较贵，煤的生产成本有的比石油还高。例如，苏联第二巴库的大油田，每吨石油的生产成本就只有一般煤炭的三分之一左右。至于天然气由于气井产量一般更高，成本比石油还要低好些。因此，赫鲁晓夫同志在关于七年计划的报告中提到用天然气和石油代替煤，七年之内总共可节约一千二百五十多亿卢布。
    而且石油和煤气可以用管道运输，一条直径六百毫米输油管，每年可输送石油一千万吨，以年输油一千万吨的输油管和同样能力的铁路比较，建设输油管的投资约为铁路的一半，运输成本约为铁路的40％。
    石油和瓦斯最重要的优点还表现在它们的使用性能上。天然石油（也叫天然原油）主要是非常复杂的碳氢化合物，包括在常温下是气态、液态和固态的各种物质。石油虽可以燃烧，但直接用作燃料质量不好，因此需要经过加工，如蒸馏、裂化、精制等过程，产品主要是汽油、煤油、柴油和气体等，都可作为内燃机的燃料。内燃机因热效率高，而体积和重量小，飞机、汽车等运输工具一般都采用内燃机作为动力。就是铁道运输，今后的趋向也是用内燃机车代替蒸汽机车。石油产品和瓦斯不但是内燃机燃料，同时也是最好的锅炉和民用燃料。因为它们可以完全燃烧掉，而且热效率高，容易操作，温度容易控制，储藏运输方便，节省人力。在许多情况下，对瓦斯来说，这些优点尤为突出。工业发达的国家，一般都有相当大的一部分煤炭不直接燃烧，而是通过干馏或是气化的方法，生产各种瓦斯作为燃料。从煤中加工生产出来的瓦斯，成本要比天然气高很多，因此，大力发展天然气，用它作燃料，就更为经济。但是，在没有天然气而有煤的地区，从煤中制取瓦斯还是有利的。苏联第六个五年计划就规定在扩大生产天然气与石油气的同时，还规定从煤和页岩中制取的瓦斯，增产二点二倍。
    主要的石油产品除燃料之外，还有润滑油、石腊、沥青等，都是机械工业和建筑工业等方面所需要的重要材料，在国民经济中有重要的意义。除此之外，在石油的加工过程中，还产生多种化工产品或化工原料，其中以加工过程生成的石油气体数量最大而成本低廉，与天然气同是发展化学工业，尤其是有机合成工业的重要原料。
    用石油气和天然气来生产化学产品，在经济上的优越性是非常显著的。例如，利用天然气作原料的氮肥厂，其产品成本要比以煤为原料的工厂低40％—60％，而投资也比后者低25％。除氮肥、碳黑等化学产品外，从石油气和天然气还可以生产种类繁多的有机合成产品。如合成纤维、合成橡胶、塑料、酒精、洗涤剂等等。广泛使用这些产品，就可以大量地节约工业用的粮食和油脂，使人们可以享用更多的食品。因此近年来“石油化学工业”逐渐形成为一个新兴的、迅速发展的工业部门。
    世界上石油和天然气的蕴藏量只占全部燃料的1％，但每年开采的数量则占全部燃料开采量的38％。这是由于石油和天然气深藏地下，不易找到，但一旦找到，由于生产成本低，一般就要大量开采，一边开采，一边扩大储量，因此年采收率很大。随着勘探技术的不断改进，和勘探规模的日益扩大，新的油田和气田也在不断发现。苏联就是因为在近几年来发现了一些大的油田和气田，才使七年计划中能提出年产石油二点三至二点四亿吨、天然气一千五百亿立方公尺的雄伟计划。就是过去一些被认为石油资源很少的西欧国家，例如意大利、法国、西德等，在第二次世界大战之后都发现了一些油田和气田。可见只要不断发展技术，大力进行勘探，石油和天然气的矿藏还可能大大增加，不像过去在旧技术的基础上所预料那样，石油资源会被迅速开采枯竭。
    我国的石油和天然气工业在解放后九年多来，由于党的重视，全体石油工作者的努力，产量已有了很大的增长，勘探规模也大大扩大，仅1958年一年的钻井总进尺（所钻的每口井的深度的总和），就超过以往八年的总和，从而发现了二十二个新的油田和气田，为我国石油和瓦斯工业的大发展创造了良好条件。石油加工工业除了注意制造燃料和润滑油之外，也已注意到化工产品的生产，有关部门都在为石油化学工业的发展从科学基础和基本建设等方面进行准备工作。
