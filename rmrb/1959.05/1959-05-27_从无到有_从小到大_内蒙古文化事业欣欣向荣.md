According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, under the leadership of the Party, the cultural and artistic undertakings of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved brilliant successes along with the Great Leap Forward in production, changing the backward cultural face of Inner Mongolia. Before liberation, people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia had no access to cultural life. After liberation, Inner Mongolia's cultural and artistic undertakings developed from scratch and gradually grew stronger. In particular, the culture and art of all nationalities have flourished on the basis of inheriting excellent national traditions. After the establishment of the people's communes, the people-run cultural undertakings have been greatly developed. Cultural institutions have been established at all levels, from the people's communes to the autonomous region, and a cultural network has basically been formed throughout the region.

National culture and art are created and performed under the guidance of serving production. For example, dances reflecting the new life of the Mongolian people, such as "Ordos" and "Milkmaid," and dances reflecting the lives of ethnic minorities in the region, such as "Oroqen," "Solon," and "Haku Mai," have been warmly welcomed and praised by people of all ethnic groups, and have also gained a reputation abroad. In order to inherit national traditional art and cultural exchange, old artists are invited to participate in the work of professional art troupes, so that young art workers can learn from old artists, and tap national art heritage; at the same time, artists who wandered everywhere in the old society are given working conditions, giving play to their strength, and creating works full of realism and revolutionary romanticism. For example, Mao Yihan's "Iron Ox" and Ba Jie's "Mutual Aid and Cooperation is Good" are welcomed by the broad masses of herdsmen.

Inner Mongolia's film art has also flourished. Not only are there cinemas in major and medium-sized cities and towns throughout the region, but also the vast masses of rural, pastoral, and forest areas, and even the most remote Oroqen and Ewenki hunting areas, who rarely see movies all year round, can now see movies. Especially with the strong help of the brother factory—Changchun Film Studio—there are art films reflecting the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia, such as "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," "People on the Grassland," "Son of a Herdsman," etc., as well as the large-scale documentary "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the March" and other films. The Inner Mongolia Film Studio, which began preparations in 1957, is now rushing to produce many art films and documentaries. The Inner Mongolia Film Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced mobile 35mm projectors and other film machines last year.

The development of book publishing in recent years has been unprecedented. In particular, the publication of Mongolian books has been able to publish Mongolian translated textbooks from elementary school to high school. In order to facilitate ethnic minority cadres to read theoretical books, in recent years, books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "The Communist Manifesto," "Problems of Leninism," "History of Social Development," and "On the Party" have been published, and literary works such as "Defend Yan'an," "Our Sun Mao Zedong," "How the Steel Was Tempered," and "The True Story of Ah Q" have been translated, greatly facilitating the direct reading of Mongolian cadres.

Inner Mongolia's young art workers have gone deep into pastoral areas, rural areas, and factories in recent years to create many moving and colorful art works.

In 1958, a year of comprehensive leap forward, Inner Mongolia's cultural and artistic work also developed more rapidly. The people of all ethnic groups in the region have also launched a vigorous mass amateur cultural activity. It has become a common practice for the masses of Mongolian, Korean, Daur and other ethnic groups to dance and sing in their spare time, and these cultural and entertainment activities are closely integrated with production and central work, publicizing the party's policies, thereby effectively promoting production and central work.

    从无到有  从小到大
    内蒙古文化事业欣欣向荣
    据内蒙古日报消息  内蒙古自治区的文化艺术事业随着生产的大跃进，在党的领导下，取得了辉煌的成就，改变了内蒙古文化落后的面貌。解放前，内蒙古各族人民根本享受不到文化生活。解放后，内蒙古的文化艺术事业从无到有，逐渐发展壮大。特别是各民族的文化艺术，在继承优秀的民族传统的基础上蓬勃发展起来。人民公社化以后，民办文化事业有了巨大发展，从人民公社到自治区，逐级建立了文化机构，全区已基本上形成了文化网。
    民族文化艺术，是在为生产服务的方针下，进行创作和演出的。如反映蒙古民族新生活的“鄂尔多斯”、“挤奶员”等舞蹈和反映区内少数民族生活的“鄂伦春”、“索伦”、“哈库麦”等舞蹈，都受到各族人民的热烈欢迎和称赞，而且在国外也有声誉。为了继承民族传统艺术和文化艺术的交流，吸收老艺人参加专业文艺团体工作，让青年文艺工作者向老艺人学习，发掘民族文艺遗产；同时，给在旧社会到处流浪的艺人以工作的条件，发挥了他们的力量，创作出充满现实主义和革命浪漫主义的作品。如毛依罕的“铁牤牛”、巴杰的“互助合作好”，受到广大牧民群众的欢迎。
    内蒙古的电影艺术事业也有了欣欣向荣的发展。全区不仅各大中小城镇有了电影院，而且常年看不到电影的农村、牧区、林区甚至最偏僻的鄂伦春和鄂温克猎区的广大群众都能看到电影了。特别是在兄弟厂——长春电影制片厂的大力帮助下，有了反映内蒙古人民生活的艺术片，如“内蒙古人民的胜利”“草原上的人们”“牧人之子”等，以及大型纪录片“前进中的内蒙古自治区”等影片。1957年开始筹建的内蒙古电影制片厂，现在正在赶制很多艺术片和纪录片。内蒙古电影机器厂，去年试制成功移动式三十五毫米放映机和其他电影机器。
    几年来图书出版事业的发展是空前的。特别是蒙文书籍的出版，已能出版从小学到高中的蒙译课本。为了便于民族干部阅读理论书籍，几年来出版了“毛泽东选集”“共产党宣言”“列宁主义问题”“社会发展史”“论党”等书，并翻译了“保卫延安”“我们的太阳毛泽东”“钢铁是怎样炼成的”“阿Q正传”等的文学著作，大大地便利了蒙族干部的直接阅读。
    内蒙古的年轻的美术工作者们，几年来深入牧区、农村、工厂创作出许多动人的、丰富多彩的美术作品。
    在全面跃进的1958年，内蒙古的文化艺术工作也更加迅速地发展起来。全区各族人民也开展了蓬蓬勃勃的群众业余文化活动。蒙族、朝鲜族、达斡尔等族群众在休息时间跳舞、唱歌已成为风气，而且这些文化娱乐活动都密切结合了生产和中心工作，宣传了党的政策，从而也有效地推动了生产和中心工作。
