Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 10th: A mass scientific and technological research activity is vigorously unfolding in Bengbu City, Anhui Province.

Starting at the end of last year, factories, enterprises, hospitals, secondary schools and above, and suburban people's communes in Bengbu City have universally established scientific research institutions. Currently, the city has more than 390 grassroots scientific research institutions, with more than 5,000 people regularly participating in research activities. Each grassroots research unit closely integrates its research activities with key issues in production and work, resulting in significant achievements. According to incomplete statistics from the industrial, transportation, finance and trade, and cultural, educational, and health departments, more than 8,400 technical innovations were proposed in the first quarter of this year, including many important innovations and cutting-edge scientific research projects. After Bengbu Glass Factory carried out scientific research activities, it solved the problem of 58 kinds of chemical raw materials that were lacking in production this year. In the first quarter, the factory not only exceeded the state plan by 28%, but also trial-produced new products such as insulation bricks and condensers.

Many factories and enterprises, in the midst of the great technological revolution, mobilized the masses to actively research and reform production tools, thereby increasing labor productivity. Bengbu Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 realized mechanization of crushing, sieving, and winding, as well as ground-level furnace top material distribution and rail transportation; gasification of roasting and sintering ore, saving more than 3,000 laborers for the entire plant. Employees of the Bengbu Special District Central Post and Telecommunications Bureau successfully developed a new type of automatic telegraph receiving and transmitting exchange, which can automatically start and stop receiving and transmitting telegrams; it can work on any circuit without the need for manual wire removal, greatly improving the utilization rate of communication equipment.

    改革生产工具　提高劳动效率
    蚌埠五千人经常研究科学技术
    新华社合肥10日电　一个群众性的科学技术研究活动，正在安徽蚌埠市热烈展开。
    去年年底，蚌埠市的工厂、企业、医院、中等以上学校、郊区人民公社等，普遍建立了科学研究机构。目前全市共有基层科学研究机构三百九十多个，经常参加研究活动的有五千多人。各基层研究单位都紧密结合生产和工作中的关键问题进行研究活动，所以成绩很大。据工业、交通、财贸和文教卫生部门不完全统计，今年第一季度就提出了技术革新八千四百多项，其中有很多重要革新和尖端科学研究项目。蚌埠玻璃厂开展科学研究活动以后，使今年生产上所缺少的五十八种化工原料，都得到解决。这个厂第一季度不但超额28％完成了国家计划，还试制了隔热砖、冷凝管等新产品。
    很多工厂、企业在大闹技术革命中，发动群众积极研究改革生产工具，提高了劳动生产率。蚌埠钢铁一厂实现破碎、粉筛、卷扬机械化、炉顶布料地面化、运输轨道化；焙烧、烧结矿石煤气化，使全厂节省三千多个劳动力。蚌埠专区中心邮电局职工，研究成功了一种新的电报收发自动交换机，它能自动和停止收报和发报；能在任何电路上工作而不要人去拆线，使通讯设备利用率大大提高。
