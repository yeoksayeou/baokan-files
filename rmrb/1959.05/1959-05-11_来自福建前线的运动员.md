	The sixteen stadiums and gymnasiums in Beijing have been open day and night these past few days for the Second National Games of the People's Liberation Army, where more than five thousand athletes are engaged in fierce competition. Among the athletes, a group wearing white sports shirts and pants are the most eye-catching. Although they may not win championships in every event, and not everyone can create amazing new records, wherever they go, people wave to them, or send warm applause and cheers. Because they are representatives of the army, navy, and air force from the Fujian Front, heroic soldiers tempered in the battle to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen.

	On the weightlifting field, we saw a young man with dark skin and particularly strong arms. With a bend of his waist, he lifted a barbell weighing more than one hundred kilograms over his head, without changing his expression. The audience admired his solid physique and skilled movements. This young man is Luo Guanxiang, a shell loader in the artillery unit on the Xiamen Front. Last autumn, in the battle to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island, he repeatedly completed the arduous task of loading shells. One day, he loaded more than three hundred shells continuously, which played a good role in ensuring victory in the battle. After the battle, he was awarded a Third Class Merit. He said that when he first came to the army, he couldn't even move a shell. Under the call of the superiors to "strengthen the body and defend the motherland," he began to exercise his arm strength with all the comrades in the company. He first climbed ropes and practiced on the horizontal bar. Later, he simply used large stones as barbells, lifting them for thirty to forty minutes every day. He said: "Sports have strengthened my physique and ensured the completion of combat missions; combat has also tempered my will and physical strength, making me an athlete."

	When we interviewed the athletes from the front, almost everyone we met was like Luo Guanxiang. They grew up in combat and emerged from the masses.

	There is an excellent reconnaissance force in the Fujian Front troops. They often appear mysteriously on enemy-occupied islands such as Kinmen and Dadan. Reconnaissance hero Ji Ruixuan once led his small unit to swim across the sea, scouted Kinmen at night, and then handily eliminated an enemy platoon, capturing a "tongue" on their return. In addition to praising their wit and bravery, people all praised their swimming skills, because each of them could swim thirty to forty li in the turbulent sea in one breath. Today, this force has sent representatives. The Fuzhou military swimming team, formed with these reconnaissance soldiers as the backbone, is holding fierce competitions in the Beijing Institute of Physical Education swimming pool. The referees say that this team has a good chance of being among the top teams.

	In the achievements created by these battle-hardened people, we saw the close integration of sports and combat, and military training on the front line. At the Xianongtan and other sports venues, we saw twenty male bicycle and motorcycle athletes from the front line. When we asked about their military branch, the answer was mostly signal corps. Some of them are even all-rounders. During the Liberation War, they developed "flying legs" while delivering orders and letters on foot; after the national liberation, the signal corps of the troops got bicycles, and they became experts in riding bicycles; with the modernization of the entire army, the signal corps became motorized, and they underwent arduous studies and gained new skills. One late night in September last year, the telephone line on the forward position was broken by enemy artillery fire. Xu Baolin, the deputy leader of the signal squad, drove a motorcycle with a telephone operator to connect the wires. The road was full of shell craters and uneven. In order not to expose the target, he drove with the lights off. Relying on their courageous spirit and skilled techniques, they completed this difficult task on time. Now, he is using that spirit to create good results in the motorcycle race held on the obstacle-ridden mountain roads in the suburbs of the capital.

	At the Xijiao Airport, people frequently cheered for the four-plane tracking aerobatic performance in the air show. This is a report performance by the aerial athletes of the Fujian Front to the Party and state leaders, and to the people of the capital. That day, four silver swallows came whizzing by in a combat formation. They rose sharply, turned, rolled, weaved left and right, as if chasing the "enemy plane," biting the "enemy plane." With a burst of gunfire, a cloud of white smoke rose from the airport, the "enemy plane" was annihilated, and the "enemy's" vehicles also caught fire, and then they each sent a signal and plunged into the high sky. This exquisite tactic and superb shooting skills are precisely the combat actions they used to pursue and annihilate enemy aircraft in air combat.

	Last autumn, representatives of the frontline naval units that severely damaged Chiang Kai-shek's naval vessels in the South China Sea also came. Yu Dunquan, the deputy captain of a certain gunboat who commanded his gunboat to cooperate with brother gunboats to severely damage the Chiang Kai-shek "Tuojiang" warship on the night of September 1 last year, won a perfect score and won first place in the men's 350cc, 5-kilometer mark race on water motorcycles. On his gunboat, all sailors have obtained first or second-class "Labor and Defense System" badges, and some have become graded athletes. In Beijing, we visited their team leader. He told us that in the frontline troops, like the gunboat commanded by Yu Dunquan, there are many companies where the entire company has reached the "Labor and Defense System" standard, and some are all graded athletes. He said: This National Games of the People's Liberation Army has taught me many things. In the future, our sports activities will be carried out more deeply and extensively, and better serve the defense of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    来自福建前线的运动员
    新华社记者　冶峰　夏维扬
    北京的十六个运动场、体育馆，这几天为解放军第二届体育运动大会日夜开放，五千多名运动员在那里进行着激烈的竞赛。在运动员中，有一批身穿白色运动衫、运动裤的，最为引人注目。他们虽然并不是每一项都能获得冠军，每个人都能创造惊人的新纪录，但是，他们走到哪里，哪里就有人向他们招手致意，或者发出热烈的掌声和欢呼声。因为他们是来自福建前线陆海空三军的代表，从严惩金门蒋军的战斗中锻炼出来的英雄战士。
    在举重场上，我们看到一位皮肤黝黑，双臂特别粗壮的青年，他一弯腰就把一百多公斤重的扛铃举过头顶，面不改色，观众为他的坚实体格和熟练动作赞叹不已。这位青年叫罗观香，是厦门前线炮兵部队中的一个装弹手。去年秋天，他在严惩金门岛蒋军的战斗中，一次又一次地完成了繁重的装填炮弹的任务。有一天，他一个人连续装填了三百多发炮弹，对保证战斗胜利起了很好的作用，战后荣立了三等功。他说，他初来部队的时候，连炮弹都搬不动。上级号召“锻炼身体，保卫祖国”，他开始和全连的同志一起，锻炼臂力。他先爬吊绳、练单杠，以后，干脆用大石块当杠铃每天举它三、四十分钟。他说：“体育运动使我增强了体质，保证了战斗任务的完成；战斗又锻炼了我的意志和体力，使我成了运动员。”
    在我们访问来自前线的运动员的时候，我们所遇到的几乎都和罗观香一样，他们从战斗中成长，从群众中产生。
    福建前线部队中有一支出色的侦察兵，他们经常神出鬼没地出现在金门、大担等敌占岛屿上。侦察英雄纪瑞瑄曾经带着他的小部队泅水渡海，夜探金门之后，顺手消灭了敌人一个排，捉了一个“舌头”归来了，人们除了称赞他们的机智勇敢以外，无不赞扬他们的游泳技术，因为他们每个人都能在惊涛骇浪的大海里一气游它三四十里。今天，这个部队派代表来了。以这些侦察兵为骨干组成的福州部队水球队，正在北京体育学院游泳馆举行着激烈的比赛。裁判员们说，这个队很有名列前茅的希望。
    在这些战功累累的人们所创造的成绩当中，我们看到了前线体育运动和战斗、军事训练紧密结合的情景。在先农坛等运动场地，我们看到了来自前线的二十名男子自行车、摩托车运动员。我们问他兵种的时候，回答多半是通信兵。其中有些人还是全材，他们在解放战争期间徒步传送命令、信件等的时候，炼成了“飞毛腿”；全国解放后，部队通信兵有了自行车，他们又成了骑自行车的能手；随着全军的现代化建设，通信兵摩托化了，他们又经过刻苦钻研，有了新的技术。去年9月的一个深夜，前沿阵地上的电话线被敌人炮火打断了，通信班副班长许宝林驾着摩托车带着电话员去接线头。路上弹坑累累，坎坷不平，为了不暴露目标，他关着灯奔驰。他们靠着勇敢的精神和熟练的技术，按时完成了这个艰难的任务。现在，他又以那种精神在首都郊区障碍重重的山路上举行的摩托车竞赛中，创造出很好的成绩。
    在西郊机场，人们不时为航空表演中的四机追踪特技表演发出热烈欢呼。这是福建前线空中健儿向党和国家领导人，向首都人民作的汇报表演。那天，只见四只银燕以战斗队形风驰电掣而来。它们急速上升，转弯，横滚，左穿右旋，像是追逐着“敌机”，咬住了“敌机”，随着一阵炮声，一团白烟从机场燃起，“敌机”被歼灭了，“敌人”的车辆也起火了，然后各自发出信号，钻入了高空。这种绝妙的战术和高超的射击技术，正是他们在空战中追歼敌机的战斗动作。
    去年秋天，在南海海面重创蒋军舰艇的前线海军部队的代表也来了。曾在去年9月1日夜晚，指挥自己炮艇配合兄弟艇队重创蒋军“沱江号”军舰的某艇副艇长于敦全，这次在男子水上摩托容积三百五十立方公分、五公里现标比赛中独得满分，荣获第一。在他的炮艇上，所有水兵都获得了一级或二级“劳卫制”证章，有的还成了等级运动员。在北京，我们访问了他们的领队。他告诉我们，在前线部队里，像于敦全指挥的炮艇一样，有许多连队全连都达到“劳卫制”标准，有的还全部都是等级运动员。他说：这次全军体育运动大会使我学习到许多东西，今后我们的体育运动将会更深入广泛地开展，更好地为保卫祖国服务。（附图片）
