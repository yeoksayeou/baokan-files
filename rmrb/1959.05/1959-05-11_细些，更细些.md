Finer, Even Finer
    Jin Wen
    The Water Conservancy Science Research Institute has further revised its 1959 scientific research plan with the spirit of "finer, even finer," making necessary adjustments to some research projects. This is a very good approach.
    Any work inevitably has a process of exploration at the beginning. This is because we have not yet grasped, or not fully grasped, its objective laws. Therefore, whether in formulating plans, proposing measures, or in the entire work practice, people's thinking cannot fully coincide with objective reality. Scientific research is an even more exploratory work, because its task is to explore the objective laws of things that people want to grasp. On the other hand, the objective laws of things can be understood. When people have undergone practice and have made a full analysis and study of things in all aspects, it is possible to grasp or fully grasp them. Therefore, people always recognize things in practice from unfamiliar to familiar, from low to high, from coarse to fine, and from the surface to the inside. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, every aspect of scientific research work and every research unit recognized many laws of the leap forward. With this foundation, this year's consideration of the leap forward plan should and can be more refined than last year.
    The standard of the leap forward is "more, faster, better, and more economical." The more conditions for achieving "more, faster, better, and more economical" are grasped, the greater the possibility of realizing the leap forward plan. To continue the Great Leap Forward this year, we must grasp more conditions than last year. Is this possible? With the experience of last year's leap forward, every scientific research unit will feel that it is easier than last year to formulate plans, propose measures, and give full play to their enthusiasm. The conditions for the leap forward are indeed much more than last year. The problem lies in first striving for perfection in the leap forward plan, which is conducive to giving full play to potential while also being steady, reliable, and leaving room for maneuver, so that it will be closer to the objective possibilities of the development of things.
    Although some of the 1958 scientific research leap forward plans were already a great leap forward, the results of practice still have potential and can be further leapt forward. Some of the measures proposed at the beginning of last year's leap forward were not specific enough, and some of the preparatory work that should have been carried out was not carried out in time or was not carried out at all, so that some human and material resources were not fully utilized, and even some parts of the leap forward plan were not well implemented or were not fully realized. This year, these issues should be taken into account, and it should be finer and even finer, so that our work is more in line with objective possibilities. The Water Conservancy Science Research Institute has brought into play the spirit of "finer and even finer" and has conducted a realistic revision and adjustment of the established leap forward plan, advancing what should be advanced, postponing what should be postponed, modifying any projects that cannot be realized temporarily, and conducting thorough investigations where necessary, and considering measures that are not specific enough in as much detail as possible. In this way, it is possible to unleash more potential and increase the possibility of realizing the leap forward plan.
    Of course, this does not mean that we should make sure that all the problems are really clear and that all the conditions are fully prepared before we start to put the leap forward plan into practice. The contradictions and conditions of things cannot be recognized all at once. Before they are fully exposed, it is impossible to fully recognize them. They can only be explored, analyzed, and studied in practice, and gradually grasped. Therefore, we can only ask to be as realistic and well-prepared as possible within the current possibilities. Some problems are not yet completely clear, and can be explored in the leap forward; some conditions are not yet available, and must be created in the leap forward. What was rough last year is required to be refined this year; now that it is refined, it will feel rough again in the leap forward, and further refinement is required. If people can formulate a leap forward plan along the objective laws of cognition, and constantly make corresponding revisions and supplements to the measures in the plan in the process of practice, they will be able to better complete or over fulfill the plan. Now that half of the second quarter has passed, how have the plans of the various scientific research units been completed? Are there any problems? We need to conduct an inspection with the spirit of finer and even finer to make the plan more practical and reliable, so as to better complete and over fulfill the plan.

    细些，更细些
    金文
    水利科学研究院用细些、更细些的精神，进一步修订了1959年度的科学研究计划，对一些研究项目作了必要的调整，这是很好的作法。
    任何工作，开始都有不可避免的探索过程。这是因为我们对它的客观规律还没有掌握或没有完全掌握。因此不论制订计划、提出措施以及在整个工作实践中，人们的思想都不可能完全同客观实际吻合。科学研究更是一种探索性很强的工作，因为它的任务就在于探索人们要求掌握的事物的客观规律。另一方面，事物的客观规律是可以认识的。当人们经过实践，并对事物作了各方面的充分的分析研究以后，是有可能掌握或完全掌握它的。所以，人们总是在实践中一次生二次熟、由低而高、由粗而精、由表及里地认识事物的。在1958年的大跃进中，科学研究工作的每一个方面、每一个研究单位，都认识了跃进的许多规律，有了这个基础，今年考虑跃进计划，就应当也可以比去年更精细一些。
    跃进的标准是多快好省。达到多快好省的条件愈掌握得多，跃进计划实现的可能性就愈大。要在今年继续大跃进，就必须掌握比去年更多的条件。这是不是可能？有了去年跃进的经验，不论制订计划、提出措施、如何发挥干劲，每一个科学研究单位都会感到比去年更容易了，跃进的条件确实比去年多得多。问题在于首先要对跃进计划精益求精，既有利于充分发挥潜力，又能作到稳妥可靠、留有余地，才会更接近事物发展的客观可能性。
    1958年科学研究的跃进计划，有的虽然已经是很大的跃进，但实践结果还有潜力，还可以再跃进一步。去年跃进之初提出的某些措施不够具体，某些应该进行的准备工作没有来得及进行或者没有去进行，以致没有使某些人力物力充分地发挥作用，甚而跃进计划的某些部分实现得不够好或没有完全实现。今年，应当考虑到这些问题，应当细些更细些，以便使我们的工作更符合客观可能性。水利科学研究院发挥了细些更细些的精神，对既订的跃进计划实事求是地进行了一番修订和调整的工作，该提前的提前，该挪后的挪后，如果有暂时还不能实现的项目就加以修正，还需要摸底的就进行摸底工作，措施不够具体的再尽可能考虑得具体一些。这样，就有可能使更多的潜力得到发挥，使跃进计划的实现增大了可能性。
    当然，这并不是说，要对所有的问题都弄得实实在在了、等所有的条件都齐齐备备了，才开始去实践跃进计划。事物的矛盾和条件，并不是一下就可以认识到的。当它没有充分暴露以前，是不可能完全认识的，只有在实践中去摸索、去分析研究、去慢慢地掌握它。所以，只能要求尽目前的可能，做到实实在在、齐齐备备。有的问题目前还不能完全清楚，可以在跃进中去探索；有的条件，目前还不具备，就要在跃进中去创造。去年粗糙的，今年要求精细；现在精细了，在跃进中又会感到还粗糙，还要求进一步的精细。人们如果能够沿着认识的客观规律去制订跃进计划，又在实践过程中对计划中的措施不断地进行相应的修改补充，就能够更好地完成或超额完成计划。现在，第二季度已经过去了一半，各科学研究单位的计划完成得怎样了？有没有什么问题？都需用细些更细些的精神进行一次检查，使计划更加落实可靠，以便更好地完成和超额完成计划。
