Habu Long

"Dear comrades, dear brothers:
From the southwest of the motherland, I send a clean Hada of the Tibetan people, and the sincere feelings of the Tibetan soldiers to the distant northeast frontier.
Some time ago, during the days when the Tibetan traitors held the Lhasa rebellion, I could not sleep soundly, nor could I eat well.
My warhorse was neighing, my war刀 was鸣啸 (I can't translate this part sorry), my conscience was calling, and my blood was boiling..."
Receiving Habu Long's letter, and looking at these exciting words, my heart flew to the banks of the turbulent Yarlung Zangbo River, to the top of the high Lhasa Mountain... Before me, the figure of that tall Tibetan warrior appeared again.
That was in 1950, a rainy season, when the People's Liberation Army's light cavalry was searching for the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit troops in the southwestern border of the motherland. Melted snow water converged into mountain torrents, rushing into the mountain streams; the rolling hills took off their white robes of ice and snow; bursts of moist spring rain fell on the fields and on the grasslands. Spring really came!
However, the wicked bandits were still cunningly fleeing, still plundering impoverished villages, and still sowing the seeds of vicious national hatred in the hearts of the kind and strong Tibetan people.
Tibet, spring hasn't come yet!
On the muddy and rugged mountain roads, in the desolate grasslands, in the dark and silent late nights, how much we needed a guide, a Tibetan who was familiar with the terrain and would enthusiastically help us!
This person finally came.
That was a strong, tall Tibetan man. A tattered Tibetan robe with one arm exposed, a sharp Tibetan knife on his waist, and long hair scattered, mercilessly washed by the rain, with water flowing over his face, which was covered in grey and black dirt, leaving traces. Only those bright eyes, piercingly bright, shone with doubt, fear, but also full of hope.
I was on the outpost and was the first to see those bright eyes: "Who?"
No answer. My two comrades and I pulled open the bolts of our rifles with a crash, hiding behind a dirt slope, "Who? Raise your hands!"
Still no answer, still striding forward...
Brought to the battalion headquarters, he still said nothing. The big eyes, shining with fear, widened even more, the veins bulging on the back of his hand, as if ready to fight anyone at any moment. Little Li, who had just learned Tibetan, called him kindly: "Countryman!"
"金君玛梅 (Jin Jun Ma Mei [Liberation Army])!" he shouted loudly, unable to hide his joy.
"Yes, it's 金君玛梅!" I didn't wait for Little Li to speak, and eagerly and kindly answered him, hoping he could quickly tell me something about his situation.
"Habu Long!" he patted his chest: "A '堆穷' (serf) from the other side of the mountain. I'll guide you, no reward needed, I want..." He clenched his fists angrily, staring at the south; suddenly, he drew out that shiny Tibetan knife and slashed it into the wooden stake beside him, those fiery eyes were wet, and his teeth gnashed.
"Habu Long," I went over to comfort him, wanting to hear him pour out his inner hatred. He suddenly pulled out his knife, took out a neatly folded piece of red silk, lowered his head, wiping the knife, and said nothing more, even Little Li couldn't do anything.
So, all we knew was that his name was Habu Long, an oppressed "堆穷" from southern Tibet.
Thus, in our ranks appeared a tall Tibetan man wearing a wide Tibetan robe and a waist knife, a silent warrior who walked in front of the team without carrying a gun.
He always hurried forward silently. He wasn't afraid of the scorching sun, he wasn't afraid of the icy rain, he wasn't afraid of the high and steep mountains, he wasn't afraid of the乱石荆棘 (chaotic rocks and thorns) -- as if someone was waiting for him ahead, as if there was an urgent matter for him to complete! He never thought of resting; his tall, somewhat clumsy body climbed mountains faster than anyone else. When the team rested, he would reluctantly, helplessly find a place to sit down alone, and take out the neatly folded piece of red silk again, carefully wiping the sharp blade, anxiously watching the soldiers smoking and drinking water, as if the soldiers' rest was delaying his important business.
The mountains became steeper and steeper, the road more and more rugged, and the big guy carrying the machine gun, who was originally closely following Habu Long without slowing down, was also panting today, with beads of sweat dripping onto the heavy machine gun, dripping onto the old soldier's light-colored uniform, dripping into the mud that Habu Long's bare feet had trod... His body involuntarily swayed. Before I could run over, Habu Long suddenly turned around and silently took the machine gun and carried it on his shoulder, continuing to stride forward.
I couldn't hold back anymore, what kind of Habu Long was he! Who knew what he had in his belly? I, a Communist Party member, had never completed the Party's tasks with any discount; but this time, with this strange Habu Long, I couldn't do as the Party had instructed: "Understand him, take care of him, help him."
During a break, I ran to Habu Long's side, pointed to the light rain, and wanted to put my raincoat on his shoulder, but his hand pushed it back. He waved his hand and tugged at his wet Tibetan robe, exceptionally smiling at me.
I got anxious, took off the bamboo hat from my head and slammed it on his head, and turned to leave, no matter how he called "金君玛梅".
When we got to the camp, I asked the big guy for a pair of extra-large liberation shoes and went to find Habu Long with a basin of warm water. As soon as he saw me, he called "金君玛梅," holding the bamboo hat to return to me. I also quickly pushed his hand back, tugging at the raincoat on my body as he had tugged at his Tibetan robe. I finally saw him laugh loudly, laughing so cheerfully, so innocently...
Regardless of whether he agreed or not, no matter how surprised he was, I pressed his feet into the basin to wash them, and then put on those perfectly fitting liberation shoes. When all this was done, I saw his eyes moisten for the second time, his lips trembling. The look of fear disappeared from his eyes, and I also breathed a long sigh of relief from my heart.
But why did he still sit alone on the grass during breaks, why did he still anxiously watch the soldiers smoking and resting? At night, why did he still hide the knife under his pillow, carefully? Habu Long, Habu Long, when will you open your heart to us...
Two days later, we finally found the bandits. The bastards had a really good idea: they were hidden in a ravine surrounded by dense forest, very hidden; but this ravine made them turtles in a jar. We quietly climbed up the highlands on both sides, and three machine guns blocked the mouth of the ditch. When we shouted again and again and the enemy still resisted fiercely, our machine guns and small cannons poured down like hailstones. Habu Long also learned from the soldiers and shouted:
"Surrender!" "Confess your guns and you won't be killed!" Seeing the big guy's machine gun start firing, he suddenly stood up, waving his Tibetan knife, wanting to rush down! I held him down at all costs, the oiled yellow bamboo hat had already been pierced by bullets. Fortunately, his fluffy long hair supported the bamboo hat, and the bullets only grazed through the gaps in his hair, breaking his scalp. I took off the bamboo hat to show him, but he seemed to see nothing, shouting, still wanting to rush down. I forced him to squat down with a stern look, and casually handed him the big guy's rifle, he picked it up and knocked down a bandit officer wearing a big brimmed hat!
When shouting slogans and rushing down the mountain, Habu Long was faster than anyone else, his wide Tibetan robe did not hinder his charge at all; he overtook the soldier throwing grenades, overtook the big guy carrying the machine gun... When I saw him again, he was still waving that shiny knife, the bamboo hat had been blown off by the wind, and his fluffy long hair was blowing backward. The terrified remnants of the bandits knelt down and raised their hands. When I ran to him, he was holding the knife high, slashing hard at the head of a person wearing a gorgeous Tibetan robe and a lambskin hat, with uncontrollable anger in his eyes. I used a lot of effort to block that arm from swinging down.
"本部 (Official), bad guy!" Habu Long used the tip of his knife to force the Tibetan official who had colluded with the bandits, shouting loudly, still wanting to slash down!
"You can't kill prisoners who have laid down their weapons!" I understood Habu Long's hatred, but the Party's policy made me have to stop him. "His sins will be dealt with by the government!"
The battle was coming to an end. It was another pitch-black night, and we approached a large village with over a hundred households. There was not a single light, not a single sound, silent, deathly silent... I was just about to ask Habu Long about the situation when Habu Long suddenly disappeared! But in front, at the end of the village not far away, a faint yellow butter lamp lit up, the light shooting through the pitch-black night sky; then two lamps, three lamps, five lamps... all the lights came on.
"金君玛梅!" Habu Long was calling.
"金君玛梅! 金君玛梅!..." Hundreds of Habu Longs were calling.
Silence was broken, the valley shook, and the loud calls衝激 (couldn't find a translation for this, apologies) the sky and震荡 (shook) the earth...
Habu Long welcomed me into his home; hundreds of Habu Longs welcomed the "金君玛梅" into their homes.
Everything was clear: Habu Long's mother was busy making tsampa and mutton... the butter lamp light shone on her sparse silver hair, her trembling dry lips, the wrinkles carved on her face by poverty and suffering. Habu Long's father had been tortured to death, tortured to death by those "本部" in gorgeous Tibetan robes, who sent "乌拉" (corvee labor)!
Everything was clear: Habu Long's sister was burning yak dung fire, the firelight shone on her beautiful face, her slightly red and swollen big eyes, the tear marks left after wiping away her tears, and a blue-purple whip mark on her arm and neck. She had been captured by bandits, and beaten severely for resisting the bandits' insults.
Everything was clear: Habu Long's face, intertwined with joy and sorrow, became more and more cheerful; he stroked the small package that his mother had prepared for him, wanting to follow the "金君玛梅" to travel all over Tibet.
Our team set off, the tall Tibetan warrior, wearing a brand new military uniform, carrying a brand new rifle, the brand new "August 1st" military emblem shining with golden light!...
Holding the letter, I thought silently: the Lhasa rebellion has been quelled, and the clouds of sorrow in Habu Long's heart have dissipated. This strong Tibetan warrior must now be riding a tall warhorse, waving a shiny Tibetan knife, following the "August 1st" red flag fluttering in the wind, protecting the new Tibet! (Attached image)

    哈布隆
    筱罗
   “亲爱的战友，亲爱的弟兄：
    从祖国的西南，我向遥远的东北边疆，寄去藏族人民洁净的哈达，寄去藏族战士诚挚的心意。
    前些时候，在西藏叛国分子举行拉萨叛乱的日子，我睡觉睡不甜，吃饭吃不香。
    我的战马在嘶叫，我的战刀在鸣啸，我的良心在呼唤，我的热血在沸腾……”
    接到哈布隆的来信，看着这激动的话语，我的心，又飞到那急湍的雅鲁藏布江畔，飞到高高的拉萨山巅……我面前，又出现了那个高大的藏族战士的身影。
    那是1950年，一个多雨的季节，人民解放军的轻骑，正在祖国西南边陲搜索残余的国民党匪军。融化了的雪水，汇成道道山洪，奔入山涧；连绵起伏的山岭，脱去了冰雪的白袍；阵阵滋润的春雨，落在田野上，落在草原上。春天真的来了！
    可是，万恶的匪徒还在狡猾地逃窜，还在抢掠贫困的村落，还在向善良、强悍的藏族人民心中撒下恶毒的民族仇恨的种子。
    西藏啊，还没有春天！
    在泥泞崎岖的山路上，在渺无人烟的草原，在漆黑、寂静的深夜，我们多么需要一个向导，需要一个熟悉地形、热情帮助我们的藏族人！
    这个人终于来了。
    那是个结实、高大的藏族汉子。一件破旧的露着一条胳膊的藏袍，一把别在腰间的锋利藏刀，披散着长发的头被雨水无情地浇洗，发丝上的水流过染满灰黑污垢的脸颊，留下道道痕迹，只有那双明亮的大眼，炯炯有神，闪着疑虑、惊恐却充满希望的光。
    我担任前哨，最先看见这双明亮的大眼：“谁？”
    没有回答，我和两个同志哗啦一声拉开枪栓，隐蔽在土坎后面，“谁？举起手来！”
    仍然没有回答，还是那么大踏步往前走……。
    带到营部，还是什么也不说。闪着惊恐目光的大眼，瞪的更大、更圆了，手背上暴起的青筋，就像随时要跟人搏斗。刚学会藏语的小李亲切地叫他：“老乡！”
      “金君玛梅（解放军）！”他大声喊着，掩藏不住自己的喜悦。
    “是的，是金君玛梅！”我没等小李开腔，就着急地、和蔼地回答他，希望他能快些告诉我一点他的情况。
      “哈布隆！”他拍着胸脯：“山那边的‘堆穷’（农奴）。我给你们带路，不要酬谢，我要……”他愤怒地攒着拳头，凝望着南方；忽然，他抽出那把雪亮的藏刀，砍进旁边的木桩上，那燃烧着怒火的大眼湿润了，牙齿咬的咯吱咯吱响。
    “哈布隆，”我走过去安慰他，想听听他倾诉内心的仇恨。他却忽然拔出刀来，掏出一块叠的整整齐齐的红绸，低下头，擦着刀，再也不作声了，连小李也没有办法。
    于是，我们只知道他叫哈布隆，一个山南的被人欺压的“堆穷”。
    于是，在我们的队列里出现了一个穿着宽大藏袍、别着腰刀的藏族汉子，一个不作声的、走在队伍最前面的不背枪的战士。
    他总是匆匆地、默默地向前赶。炽热的太阳他不怕，冰冷的雨水他不怕，高山陡壁他不怕，乱石荆棘他不怕——就像有什么人在前面等他，有什么紧急事要他去完成！他从没想到要休息；高大的显得有些笨重的身躯，爬起山来比谁都伶俐。队伍休息了，他总是勉强地、无可奈何地独自找个地方坐下，又掏出那块叠得整整齐齐的红绸，细心地擦着锋利的刀刃，不时焦急地望着抽烟、喝水的战士，就像战士们的休息耽误了他的大事一样。
    山越来越陡峭，路越来越崎岖，身体最棒的扛机枪的大个子，原来是一步不慢地紧跟着哈布隆，可是今天也累得喘不过气来，豆大的汗珠滴在沉重的机枪上，滴在老兵淡颜色的军装上，滴在哈布隆的赤脚踩过的泥泞里……他的身子不由自主地摇晃起来。没等我跑过去，哈布隆却忽然转过身，一声不响地把机枪接去扛在肩上，照旧迈开大步往前赶。
    我再也忍不住了，什么样的哈布隆啊！谁知他肚里装些啥？我，一个共产党员，还从来没有打半点折扣地完成党的任务；而这次，对这个奇怪的哈布隆，我却不能像党交代的那样：“了解他，照顾他，帮助他。”
    休息了，我跑到哈布隆身旁，指指下着的细雨，要把雨衣披在他肩上，可是被他的手推回来了。他一面摆着手，一面扯扯身上潮湿的藏袍，破例地朝我微笑起来。
    我急了，摘下头上的斗笠往他脑袋上一扣，扭身就走，任他怎么叫“金君玛梅”也不回头。
    到了宿营地，我向大个子要了一双特大号的解放鞋，端盆温水去找哈布隆。他一见我就叫“金君玛梅”，拿着斗笠要还给我。我也赶忙推回他的手，像他扯藏袍那样扯扯身上的雨衣。我总算看见他大声地笑了，笑得那么开朗，那么天真……
    不管他同不同意，不管他是多么惊奇，我把他的脚按进盆里就洗，然后套上那双刚刚合适的解放鞋。这一切都做完了，我第二次看见他的眼睛湿润了，嘴唇哆嗦着。惊恐的神情从他的目光里消失了，我也从心里长长地舒了一口气。
    可是，休息时，他为什么还独自个儿坐在草地上，为什么还焦急地看着战士们抽烟、休息？晚上，他为什么还把刀藏在枕头底下，小心翼翼？哈布隆啊哈布隆，什么时候你才向我们打开心扉……
    过了两天，土匪终于被我们找到了。兔崽子们想得真妙：藏在一个密林环绕的山洼里，非常隐蔽；可是这个山洼，却使他们成了瓮中之鳖。我们悄悄摸上两边的高地，三挺机枪封锁沟口。当我们再三喊话，敌人还猛烈顽抗时，我们的机枪、小炮就像冰雹一样倾泻下去。哈布隆也学着战士们一样高喊：
  “投降！”“缴枪不杀！”看着大个子的机枪打开了锅，他猛地站起来，挥动藏刀，要往下冲！我不顾一切地按住他，那顶油过的黄斗笠已经被子弹打穿了。多亏他那蓬松的长发把斗笠支起来，子弹只从发缝中掠过，碰破点头皮。我摘下斗笠给他看，他却像什么也没看见，喊着，还要冲下去。我用严厉的目光逼着他蹲下来，随手递给他那支大个子的步枪，他端起来就撩倒一个戴大盖帽的匪军！
    在喊着口号冲下山去的时候，哈布隆比谁都快，宽大的藏袍一点也不妨碍他冲锋；他赶过了扔手榴弹的战士，赶过了端着机枪的大个子……等我再看见他时，他仍旧挥着那把雪亮的刀，斗笠被风吹掉了，蓬松的长发吹得向后飘起。吓呆了的残匪，纷纷跪下举起双手。等我跑到他跟前，他正高举着刀，狠命地往一个穿着华丽藏袍、戴羊羔皮帽的人的头上砍下去，眼里射出不可遏止的怒火。我使出好大的劲才挡住那只挥下去的胳膊。
    “本部（官员），坏蛋！”哈布隆用刀尖逼着勾通匪军的藏族官员，大声吼叫，还要往下砍！
    “不能杀害放下武器的俘虏！”我明白哈布隆的仇恨，但党的政策使我一定要拦住他。“他的罪恶，由政府处理！”
    战斗接近尾声了。又是一个漆黑的夜晚，我们走近一个百多户的大村落。没有半点灯光，没有半点声响，寂静，死一般的寂静……我正要向哈布隆问问情况，哈布隆忽然不见了！但是在前面，在不远的村落的尽头，一盏淡黄的酥油灯亮了，灯光射穿了漆黑的夜空；接着两盏、三盏、五盏……所有的灯全亮了。
    “金君玛梅！”哈布隆在叫。
    “金君玛梅！金君玛梅！……”千百个哈布隆在叫。
      寂静打破了，山谷震动了，宏亮的呼声冲激着天空，震荡着大地……
      哈布隆把我迎进他的家；千百个哈布隆们把“金君玛梅”迎进他们的家。
      一切都明白了：哈布隆的妈妈正在忙着弄糌粑、羊肉……酥油光照出她的稀疏的银发、哆哆嗦嗦的干瘪的嘴唇，贫困和痛苦刻在面颊上的皱纹。哈布隆的父亲被折磨死了，被那些穿着华丽藏袍的“本部”派“乌拉”（派差役）折磨死了！
    一切都明白了：哈布隆的妹妹正在烧牛粪火，火光照出她美丽的面庞，微微红肿的大眼，擦干眼泪以后留下的泪痕，胳膊和脖颈上一道青紫的鞭伤。她曾经被匪徒抓去，因为反抗匪徒的侮辱挨了毒打。
    一切都明白了：交织着欢乐和悲痛的哈布隆的脸上，越来越开朗；他抚摸着母亲给他准备的小包，要跟随“金君玛梅”走遍西藏。
    我们的队伍出发了，身材高大的藏族战士，穿着崭新的军装，挎着崭新的步枪，崭新的“八一”军徽闪闪放金光！……
    拿着信，我默默地想着：拉萨叛乱已经平息了，哈布隆心头的愁云散了。这个坚强的藏族战士，现在一定正骑着高大的战马，挥舞着雪亮的藏刀，随着迎风招展的“八一”红旗，在保卫着新西藏！（附图片）
