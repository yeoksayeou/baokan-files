Hebei Daily News: The Baoding region of Hebei has deployed over 2.34 million people for an anti-drought campaign, launching an emergency irrigation drive to ensure a bumper wheat harvest by every possible means.

Since the beginning of spring, the Baoding region has not had a thorough rain. Out of the region's 4.75 million mu of wheat fields, over 2.3 million mu are showing severe drought conditions. On April 25th, the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requested that all counties, communes, and teams prioritize anti-drought irrigation, combining it with the completion of spring planting, based on varying circumstances. It also transferred over 200 cadres to assist the work in various counties. Each county held emergency meetings, organizing a large number of cadres to go to the countryside and deeply mobilize the anti-drought struggle. By May 4th, the entire region had 2.34 million people (including government cadres, students, and workers) engaged in anti-drought irrigation.

During this campaign, ideological mobilization was thorough, cadre leadership was specific, actions were quick, and the scale was large. Liu Zhenzong, First Secretary of the An'guo County Party Committee, personally led cadres deep into the fields. The entire county mobilized over 900 cadres, 110,000 laborers, and over 4,000 teachers and students. The entire county universally adopted the method of cadres being responsible for machines and Party members being responsible for waterwheels, working in shifts day and night. Over 1,500 locomotive boiler drivers were also mobilized ideologically, and operational experience was exchanged, greatly improving work efficiency. The Jing'an Production Team of the Gaoli Commune in Yi County had 1,200 mu of wheat fields with soil dried to a depth of two or three inches. Some cadres and commune members had a complacent and paralyzed mentality, believing that the team's 16 waterwheels and 15 winches were all in operation, and the problem was not significant. After investigation by the Party branch, it was discovered that these tools could only irrigate 40 mu of wheat fields per day, and it would take 30 days to irrigate once. Subsequently, all commune members were mobilized to work together, with tools running continuously and people taking shifts, going all out to irrigate wheat. After surveying, a canal was opened to draw water from the Zhongyi River to irrigate wheat. In this way, the team increased its daily wheat field irrigation from 40 mu to 200 mu, and at the same time, 900 mu of dry land was turned into paddy fields. The Shangfa Village Production Team of the Fangguan Commune in Zhuo County had over 1,000 mu of Class Three wheat, which they were unwilling to manage after one round of management. The Party branch of this team presented the fact that 310 mu of Class Three wheat had been upgraded after being strengthened with management, overcoming the fixed mindset, and immediately organized a professional team to work in a concentrated manner. The team's 1,080 mu of Class Three wheat has generally been top-dressed and irrigated once. To ensure that all Class Three wheat was upgraded, the Shiting Commune Party Committee of this county extracted four secretaries and 102 management district cadres on the evening of May 2nd, forming a wheat upgrade command network, dividing battle zones for concentrated efforts, focusing on the management of lower-grade wheat, and specifically helping backward teams arrange labor.

During the concentrated campaign, all communes and production teams demonstrated a tenacious fighting spirit, overcoming difficulties by every possible means. Ding County mobilized over 260,000 male and female commune members to launch a fierce attack on the drought demon. The entire county used over 20,000 large and small water lifting tools such as waterwheels, winches, and carrying poles, irrigating wheat while sowing seeds. The Quyang and Lingshan mountainous communes in this county, which lacked water sources, also moved water tanks and large urns to the slopes, carrying water at night and irrigating the land during the day. In addition to using all tools, the Zhanli Production Team of the Quyang Commune sewed three large water bags with tarpaulins, which could transport 120 loads of water at a time. Many production teams in the Lingshan Commune also adopted the method of hoisting water buckets up high mountains with windlasses, increasing labor efficiency by 23 times compared to carrying water by people to irrigate the land. The Guantou Commune in Yi County had 480 mu of wheat fields planted on the top of the mountain, and the drought situation was particularly serious. The commune mobilized the masses to adopt the method of "immortals guiding the way" to draw water up the high mountain, solving the problem of lacking water sources. The entire commune organized over 950 strong laborers and dug 97 "immortals guiding the way" wells and canals in three days. By May 4th, river water had been used for a general irrigation.

    小麦收成局未定　后期管理再加劲
    保定地区出动抗旱大军
    突击浇水力争小麦升级
    河北日报消息　河北保定地区出动二百三十四万多名抗旱大军，掀起抗旱浇麦突击运动，千方百计保证小麦丰收。
    保定地区入春以来，一直没落透雨，全区四百七十五万亩麦田，有二百三十多万亩呈现严重旱象。中共保定地委于4月25日要求各县、社、队都区别不同情况，把抗旱浇麦放到首位，结合完成春播，并抽调了二百多名干部，分赴各县协助工作。各县召开紧急会议，组织了大批干部下乡，深入发动抗旱斗争。到5月4日，全区已有二百三十四万人（包括机关干部、学生、工人等）投入抗旱浇麦。
    在这一运动中，思想发动深入，干部领导具体，行动快，规模大。中共安国县委第一书记刘振宗，亲自带领干部深入田间，全县抽出九百多名干部，发动起十一万名劳动力和四千多名师生。全县普遍采取了各级干部包机器、党团员包水车的办法，日夜轮班，一扎到底。还对一千五百多名锅驼机司机手，以队为单位，边进行思想发动，边交流操作经验，大大提高了工作效率。易县高里公社井安生产队，有一千二百亩麦田土壤干了二、三寸深，部分干部和社员有自满麻痹情绪，认为全队的十六辆水车和十五架辘轳已全部动起来，问题不大了。经过党支部摸底，发现这些工具一天只能浇四十亩麦田，三十天才能浇一遍。接着就动员全队社员一起上阵，歇人不歇工具，全力浇麦；又经过勘测，开了一条水渠，引来中易水河水浇麦。这样全队由日浇麦田四十亩提高到了二百亩，同时还有九百亩旱地变成了水田。涿县方官公社上垡村生产队的一千多亩三麦，只管理了一次就不愿管理了。这队的党支部摆出了以前对三百一十亩三类麦加强管理后已经升级的事实，克服了定局思想，立即组织专业队突击，全队的一千零八十亩三类麦已普遍追了一次肥，浇了一次水。这县的石亭公社党委为保证所有三类麦升级，于5月2日晚间，抽出四名书记和一百零二名管理区干部，组成了小麦升级指挥网，划分战区突击，突出抓次麦管理，并具体帮助落后队安排劳力。
    在突击运动中，各公社和生产队表现了顽强的战斗精神，千方百计克服困难。定县出动了二十六万多男女社员，向旱魔展开了猛攻，全县使用起水车、辘轳、挑杆等大小提水工具二万多件，边浇麦、边播种。这县水源缺乏的曲阳、灵山等山区公社，把水缸、大瓮也搬上了山坡，晚上担水，白日浇地。曲阳公社站里生产队除使用起所有工具外，还用雨布缝了三个大水袋，一次可运水一百二十担。灵山公社的许多生产队还采用了绞关空运水桶上高山的办法，比人担水浇地提高劳动效率二十三倍。易县管头公社有四百八十亩麦田种在山顶上，旱象特别严重。该公社发动群众采取了“群仙传道”引水上高山的办法，解决了缺乏水源的困难，全社组织了九百五十多名强壮劳力，三天就挖成了九十七处“群仙传道”的井、渠，到5月4日就引用河水普浇了一遍。
