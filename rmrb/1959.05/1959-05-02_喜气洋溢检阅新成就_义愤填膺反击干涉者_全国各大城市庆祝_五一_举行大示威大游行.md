Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 1st: Two hundred thousand working people in Shanghai reported to the motherland the achievements of the continued Great Leap Forward on all production fronts this year during today's "May Day" demonstration parade. They also strongly condemned the criminal activities of imperialists and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in China's internal affairs.

The marching crowds, starting from the People's Square in the city center, were a magnificent sight from 8 a.m. onwards. An "Advanced Detachment" composed of more than 20,000 workers was warmly welcomed. This detachment consisted of representatives from over 200 factories and transportation, construction, finance, and trade units with the most outstanding achievements in production and management citywide. The banners and charts held by the workers also indicated the determination of the city's workers to respond to the call of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, resolutely fulfill and over fulfill this year's state plan, and greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with new and brilliant achievements.

Representatives from Shanghai's major steel plants almost all participated in the "Advanced Detachment." Carrying forward the soaring spirit of over fulfilling 1.2 million tons of steel last year, steel production has increased month by month this year. The steel output in the first quarter increased by 58.6% compared with the same period last year. The daily pig iron production of Shanghai's first medium-sized blast furnace has also exceeded the original design level since late April.

More than 100 communes in eleven counties, after rectification and consolidation, have demonstrated tremendous advantages. This year's spring plowing and production preparations were grasped earlier and more meticulously.

The people of Shanghai expressed great anger at the instigation of the Tibetan rebellion and interference in China's internal affairs by British imperialists and Indian expansionists. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as: "Tibet is an indivisible part of China! Smash the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity!"
