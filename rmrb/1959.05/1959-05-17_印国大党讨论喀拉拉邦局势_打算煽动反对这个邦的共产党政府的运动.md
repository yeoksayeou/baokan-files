Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 15th. According to a report in the "Times of India" on the 14th, Kerala State Congress leaders discussed plans with the Congress high command on the 13th to incite a statewide movement against the Communist government in the state.

The report said that the People's Socialist Party and the Muslim League of Kerala are expected to participate in this incitement movement, which will begin at the end of this month.

The situation in Kerala has recently undergone new developments. According to newspaper reports, representatives of opposition parties, Catholics, Muslims, and Hindu castes in the state held a meeting in Changanacherry, Kerala, on May 2nd, and passed a resolution to jointly resist "to end" the "red rule" in Kerala. The meeting also called on the masses to take action to "save" the state from the "danger of communism."

Govindan Nair, secretary of the Communist Party Kerala State Committee, said at a press conference in New Delhi last week that the purpose of the proposed incitement movement is to obstruct the implementation of progressive legislation passed by the Communist-led government in Kerala, especially opposing the Land Relations Bill currently under discussion in the State Assembly. He said, "The peaceful transformation of society through democratic means is being challenged by reactionaries."

During a recent meeting of the Congress Party in Delhi, Congress President Indira Gandhi, in reporting on her recent visit to Kerala, attacked the Kerala Communist government for "deceiving" the people with "hypocritical slogans" and for using tribal sentiments to achieve political goals and expand the power of the Communist Party.

Indian newspapers reported on the 14th that the Chief Minister of the Kerala State Government, Namboodiripad, issued a statement on May 12th, powerfully refuting Indira Gandhi's claims and using facts to prove that it was the Congress Party that formed an alliance with tribal organizations such as the Muslim League, Catholics, and Nair Service Society (an influential Hindu caste that had been a strong supporter of the former princely regime in Kerala) of Kerala, and they formed an alliance to oppose the progressive measures of the state government. He also reiterated the Communist Party's support for providing special facilities in education and services to the exploited and backward public.

The Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and other parties are currently conducting an anti-communist movement in Kerala, mainly by attacking the Education Bill, which has been approved by the government and will be implemented in the state. Indian Catholic bishops and Hindu caste organizations have decided to keep some schools closed after the holidays in opposition to the bill.

    印国大党讨论喀拉拉邦局势
    打算煽动反对这个邦的共产党政府的运动
    新华社新德里15日电据“印度时报”14日报道，喀拉拉邦国大党领袖13日同国大党最高当局讨论了在全邦范围内煽动反对这个邦中的共产党政府的计划。
    消息说，预料，喀拉拉邦的人民社会党和穆斯林联盟将一起参加在本月底开始的这次煽动运动。
    喀拉拉邦的局势最近有新的发展。据报纸报道，这个邦中的反对党、天主教、穆斯林和印度教族的代表5月2日曾经在喀拉拉邦的昌甘却举行的会议上，通过了关于一致进行抵抗“以结束”喀拉拉邦的“赤色统治”的决定。会议并且要求群众采取行动来“挽救”这个邦，以免遭“共产党的危险”。
    共产党喀拉拉邦委员会书记戈文丹·奈尔上星期在新德里举行的记者招待会上说，建议发动煽动运动的目的在于阻挠在喀拉拉邦执行共产党领导的政府所通过的进步立法，特别是反对现在在邦议会中讨论的土地关系法案。他说，“通过民主办法进行的社会的和平改造正受到反动派的挑战。”
    在德里国大党最近举行的一次会议期间，国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人在报告她最近对喀拉拉邦的访问时，曾经攻击喀拉拉邦共产党政府以“虚伪的口号”来“哄骗”人民，并且攻击共产党政府利用部族情绪来达到政治目的和扩大共产党的力量。
    印度各报14日报道，喀拉拉邦政府的首席部长南布迪里巴德曾经在5月12日发表声明，有力地驳斥了英迪拉·甘地夫人的说法，并且用事实证明，同喀拉拉邦的穆斯林联盟、天主教徒和奈尔服务社（一个有势力的印度教族，它一直是喀拉拉邦的前土邦政权的得力助手）等部族组织结成联盟的正是国大党，它们结成联盟来反对邦政府的进步措施。他还重申共产党支持在教育和服务方面给予被剥削和落后的公众以特别的方便。
    国大党、人民社会党以及其它政党目前在喀拉拉邦内主要通过攻击将在这个邦内实施的已经由政府批准的教育法案，来进行反对共产党的运动。印度天主教主教和印度教族组织已经决定在假期后使一些学校不再开学，来反对这个法案。
