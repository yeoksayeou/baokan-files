Increase Revenue and Reduce Expenditure, Conserve Every Drop of Water
Various Localities Strengthen Irrigation Management to Strive for Rational Water Use

　　This dispatch reports that various localities are further strengthening irrigation management to strive to fully exert the benefits of farmland water conservancy projects.

　　Currently, it is the time when wheat and rice fields need irrigation. This year, due to deep plowing, close planting, and increased fertilization, water consumption has also increased. Therefore, while constructing farmland water conservancy projects, various localities have generally paid attention to strengthening management and using water rationally. As of mid-April, the Hengyang, Qianyang, and Chenxian Special Districts in Hunan Province had inspected the water storage of over 10,000 reservoirs. In Jiangxi, various localities adopted the method of simultaneous construction, acceptance, and water storage during spring water conservancy construction, enabling newly built projects to play their role in a timely manner. Due to adopting the above methods, Chongren County in this province has ensured that all 685 newly built projects this year are full of water in ponds, reservoirs, and pools. Although there was little rainfall this spring plowing season, water use was still guaranteed. The Tangziba Reservoir built in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, was constructed while storing water. In the past month, it has been raining continuously, with more than 240,000 cubic meters of water flowing in per day and night. It seemed that the water level would soon overflow the dam. However, thanks to the temporary efforts of the laborers who completed an auxiliary project, both the dam and the water were preserved.

　　In strengthening irrigation management, various localities have paid attention to planned water use, adjusting irrigation systems, and increasing water lifting tools. After the end of spring planting, the Yulin Special District in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region conducted a comprehensive inspection of the water storage of all water conservancy projects in various counties and calculated the water storage of each irrigation area and the water demand of rice fields. If it was found that water storage was insufficient, specific solutions were immediately found. After such an inspection of the Luoxian irrigation area in Pingnan County, water was released from areas with abundant water to rice fields lacking water, ensuring that water-deficient fields were irrigated. After the inspection, various counties reorganized and improved irrigation management organizations, assigned dedicated personnel to allocate water, and implemented water-saving measures: first releasing water to lower areas, then to higher areas; first using long-flowing water from rivers and weirs, then using water from ponds and reservoirs, etc. After such arrangements, drought resistance capacity can generally be extended by 15 to 20 days. According to the situation that the demand for farmland water has increased sharply this year due to the widespread implementation of production increase measures such as deep plowing and close planting, Shimen County in Hunan Province has adopted three methods to adjust the irrigation system: moving from far to near, shortening the irrigation distance; changing return water to downstream water, expanding the area of gravity irrigation; and building through channels, connecting large and small projects with each other, adjusting and replenishing each other, and balancing the irrigation burden. Through adjusting the irrigation system, the county has increased the area of gravity irrigation by more than 150,000 mu, and the average drought resistance capacity of each irrigation area can reach 60 days. The Bengbu Special District in Anhui Province comprehensively inspected the original water lifting tools and calculated the need for water lifting tools based on the rice planting area, and made specific arrangements for technical strength and raw materials. After the inspection, the entire special district immediately organized ironworkers and carpenters to rush to manufacture and repair.

　　Various localities have also paid attention to the maintenance and management of water conservancy projects, some implementing four packages (package project maintenance, package irrigation and drainage, package irrigation area, package field management), some implementing three fixings (fixing responsibility to prevent project damage, fixing water consumption to prevent waste, fixing remuneration), some implementing two guarantees (guaranteeing that ponds, weirs, dams, reservoirs, and fields are full of water, guaranteeing sufficient water without shortage), and dividing the irrigation area according to the topography, water source, and project layout, under the principle of facilitating water diversion and circulation, convenient storage and irrigation, and adjustment and use; within the irrigation area, the water courses were unified, the water use was adjusted, and the maximum efficiency of the project was brought into play.

　　开源节流　涓滴归田
    各地加强灌溉管理力求合理用水
    本报讯　各地正进一步加强灌溉管理工作，力争充分发挥农田水利工程的效益。
    当前正是麦田稻田需要灌水的时候。今年由于深耕、密植、多肥，用水量随之加大。因此，各地在兴修农田水利的同时，普遍注意了加强管理、合理用水。湖南衡阳、黔阳、郴县三个专区到4月中旬止，已经检查了一万多座水库的蓄水情况。江西各地在春修水利中采取了边修建、边验收、边蓄水的办法，使新修工程及时发挥了效益。这个省的崇仁县由于采用上述办法，今年新修的六百八十五处工程都实现了塘满、库满、池满，今年春耕时虽然雨水少也保证了用水。云南腾冲县修的塘子坝水库，一面筑坝一面蓄水，最近一个月来连日下雨，一昼夜要流入二十四万多公方水，眼看水位就要过坝。但是由于民工们临时突击完成了一项辅助工程，既保住了坝，也保住了水。
    各地在加强灌溉管理中，注意了计划用水、调整灌溉系统和增加提水工具等工作。广西僮族自治区玉林专区在春插结束之后，各县都全面检查了所有水利工程的贮水情况，计算了各个灌区的贮水量和稻田需水量。发现贮水不足的立即找出具体的解决办法。平南县的罗贤灌区，经过这样检查，从水多的地方放水给缺水的稻田，使缺水田都得到灌溉。各县在检查之后，都整顿和健全了灌溉管理组织，固定专人分配水量，并且实行了节约用水的办法：先放低处水，后放高处水；先用河涧圳堰长流水，后用塘库水等。经过这样安排，抗旱能力一般都能延长十五天到二十天。湖南省石门县根据今年普遍推行深耕、密植等增产措施后农田需水量急剧增加的情况，采取三种办法来调查灌溉系统：移远就近，缩短灌溉距离；变返水为顺水，扩大自流灌溉面积；修通渠道，大小工程相互连接，相互调剂，调余补缺，平衡灌溉负担。全县通过调整灌溉系统，增加了自流灌溉面积十五万多亩，各灌区平均抗旱能力可达六十天。安徽蚌埠专区一面对原有提水工具进行全面检查，一面根据水稻种植面积算提水工具需要账，并对技术力量和原材料作了具体安排。检查以后，全专区立即组织铁工、木工赶制、抢修。
    各地还注意了水利工程的养护管理工作，有的实行四包（包工程养护，包灌水排水，包灌溉面积，包田间管理），有的实行三定（定责任不准工程损坏、定用水量不准浪费，定报酬），有的实行二保证（保证塘、堰、坝、库、田水满，保证水够不缺），并且根据地形、水源和工程布置情况，在便于引水流通，蓄灌便利，调剂使用的原则下划分了灌区；在灌区以内，统一调整水路、调剂用水、发挥工程的最大效能。
