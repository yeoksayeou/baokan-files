Short Commentary

　　"The Oil is Very Abundant"
　　Petroleum is called the blood of industry. Cars, ships, machines, tractors plowing fields, and water pumps for irrigation all need petroleum.
　　In the past few years, China's petroleum industry has developed greatly. In 1958, the national petroleum production had already exceeded four times that of 1952. However, the leaping progress of industrial and agricultural production and transportation requires even more petroleum. Petroleum production cannot meet the needs for the time being, so vigorously promoting petroleum conservation is of great practical significance.
　　To conserve petroleum, specifically, there are three methods: first, to practice conservation; second, to use substitutes; and third, to organize recycling. In recent years, various localities have created many effective and valuable experiences. For example, the highway transportation department promotes coasting with the engine off, chassis lubrication, and trailer transportation; the paint industry uses turpentine instead of gasoline; steam engines on trains and ships use emulsified oil instead of lubricating oil, and so on, all of which have achieved great results in conserving petroleum. Taking Shanghai as an example, in the past four years, various methods have been adopted to save more than 50,000 tons of fuel oil, which is equivalent to the production of a refinery with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons, showing that the potential for petroleum conservation is very large.
　　At present, the oil consumption levels in different regions and departments vary greatly. In the first quarter of this year, the oil consumption per 100 kilometers for buses was as low as 16 liters and as high as 27 liters. This gap shows that there are still many tricks to be found in conserving petroleum.
　　It is worth pointing out that some units have recently relaxed their efforts in conserving petroleum. Individual transportation units emphasize that it is difficult to achieve fast loading, fast running, or safe transportation if fuel conservation is emphasized. In fact, many transportation departments, starting from adjusting machinery and improving driving operations, have not only saved gasoline but also run faster, loaded more, and become safer. The problem still lies in whether the idea of conserving fuel consumption is valued in thinking. Only when there is a high degree of conservation concept in thinking can there be positive performance in practical actions, and can all possible ways to open up conservation avenues be found. Recently, Shanghai has used biogas and liquid hydrocarbons as fuel to replace gasoline, and the Liaoning transportation department has used liquefied gas to drive vehicles, all of which are successful examples of gasoline conservation. Of course, when using substitutes, attention must be paid to operational safety and product quality, and new substitutes must be tested before they can be gradually promoted.
　　Petroleum conservation is both an economic and a political task. To do this work well, leaders must pay attention, mobilize the masses, let everyone come up with ideas, and continuously improve technology and operations to tap greater potential, focusing on the weak links of fuel consumption.

### “油水”大得很

　　“油水”大得很
　　石油被称为工业的血液。车船开行、机器运转、拖拉机耕田、抽水机灌溉，都需要石油。
    几年来，我国石油工业有了很大的发展。1958年全国石油产量已经超过1952年的四倍。但是，跃进中的工农业生产和交通运输业，对石油的需要量更大。石油生产一时还满足不了需要，所以大搞石油的节约就具有十分重大的现实意义。
    节约石油，具体地说有三种办法：第一是搞节约，第二是搞代用；第三是组织回收。几年来，各地创造了不少行之有效的宝贵经验。譬如公路运输部门推行汽车熄火滑行、底盘润滑、挂车运输；油漆工业用松节油代替汽油，火车、轮船上的蒸汽机用乳化油代替润滑油等等，都在节约石油上收到很大的效果。以上海市为例，最近四年来采取各种办法节约的油料有五万多吨，相当于一个年产一万多吨炼油厂的生产量，足见石油节约的潜力很大。
    目前，不同地区、不同部门的耗油水平悬殊还很大。今年第一季度公共汽车每跑一百公里的耗油量少的只要十六公升，多的却要二十七公升。这种差距说明节约石油还大有窍门可找。
    值得指出的是，最近有些单位对节约石油的工作放松了。个别交通运输单位强调节约用油就很难做到快装快跑或是安全运输。事实上，很多交通部门从调整机械、改进驾驶操作着手，不但节约了汽油，而且跑得更快、装得更多，更加安全。问题还在于思想上对节约油耗是否重视，只有思想上具备了高度的节约观念，才能在实际行动中有积极的表现，才能千方百计，打开节约门路。最近上海以沼气、液态烃代汽油作燃料，辽宁运输部门使用液化煤气行车，都是节约汽油的成功事例。当然，在使用代用品时，必须注意操作安全和产品的质量，对于新的代用品一定要经过试验才能逐步推广。
    节约石油工作是经济工作也是一项政治工作，要做好这一工作，必须领导重视，发动群众，大家想办法，针对费油的薄弱环节，不断改进技术、改进操作，挖出更大的潜力。
