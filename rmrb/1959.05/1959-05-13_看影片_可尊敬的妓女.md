    Watching the Film "The Respectful Prostitute"
    Bai Jingsheng
    The film "The Respectful Prostitute," adapted from the stage play by French writer Jean-Paul Sartre, is filled with strong voices of protest against the American capitalist system. It expresses the righteous indignation of honest people; powerfully exposes the sinful activities carried out by those American bigwigs under the guise of "democracy and freedom," and condemns the barbaric acts of the twentieth century hidden behind the mask of "civilization."
    A black man was killed for no reason. The murderer was Freddy, the nephew of Senator Clarke, a white man. At first glance, the law of "murder is a crime" did not seem to have failed, and the murderer was detained. However, these senators, police, and secret agents were exploiting this law to the best of their ability, turning black into white: it was clear that Freddy was toying with and insulting a white prostitute named Lizzie, and Lizzie, unable to endure this teasing and entanglement, ran to the black people's carriage to hide. An innocent black man was killed by Freddy. But they insisted that Lizzie say it was the black man who wanted to insult her, and that Freddy killed the black man to protect this white woman. In short, they portrayed the murderer as a hero who suppressed the strong and supported the weak, in order to exonerate the murderer's crime and maintain the so-called "national dignity."
    The event chosen by the author has profound typical significance. The film exposes racial discrimination in the United States, the lack of protection for black lives, and at the same time further reveals the essence of this racial discrimination, which is just another form of class oppression.
    Senator Clarke and his son Fred are the representatives of this "American spirit." It is such people who are influencing the fate of the American people. The film reveals the despicable actions and the ugly faces of these politicians and the bourgeoisie through this old and young pair, father and son.
    We see that the well-dressed young gentleman Fred, on the one hand, hypocritically maintains the dignity of his young master, and on the other hand, engages in secret agent activities at Lizzie's place as a "noble" customer, threatening Lizzie to give false testimony. Although Lizzie is a despised prostitute, her heart is upright. She is unwilling to violate the facts and her conscience, and is not tempted or threatened by money. A strong contrast is formed between Fred and Lizzie: one is a prostitute, but her heart is pure and white; the other is a well-dressed senator's son, but his heart is despicable and dirty.
    Lizzie is one of the lower-class women who have been insulted and persecuted, and the film successfully portrays this character. Life has accustomed her to obediently enduring the insults of others, but life has also tempered her to be bold and full of hostility. Her tone is always provocative towards the dirty society, dirty people, and dirty things. The film successfully blends her contradictory temperament, revealing the true and kind nature of this character.
    Threats, bribery, and even torture did not make Lizzie submit. Only under Senator Clarke's beautiful words of "national dignity" and "white-haired old mother" was Lizzie temporarily confused. This treatment is extremely profound. It shows that Lizzie wants people to respect her like a human being, and she pities the "mother who is about to lose her son." Here, Senator Clarke precisely grasped Lizzie's psychology to achieve his despicable purpose.
    Senator Clarke in the film is indeed a cunning and experienced politician. At the beginning of the film, we see him holding a charity reception for black children. He strokes the children's foreheads, appearing kind and amiable, no less than the reborn parents of these orphans. However, the facts expose his hypocrisy. This is just a political deal he is doing for his election.
    He treats Lizzie like an "honored guest" at home, calling her "Lizzie, my child!" He even agrees with Lizzie's refusal to give false testimony, saying that he is willing to sacrifice his nephew. How upright and fair! However, lies cannot cover up the truth. Senator Clarke's remarks in front of the statue of Washington in the film incisively reveal his intentions and the essence of "American democracy." Listen to what he says:
    "Lizzie... you have to choose one of two people, one of whom must be eliminated... Do you want to protect that black man? He is accidental, lazy! He is idle all day long, what is the value of living? If he is eliminated, it will have no impact on society; on the contrary, the other is Freddy! He killed a black man, but even so, he is a pure American, a soldier, and he has a factory that supports two thousand workers. If he is eliminated, two thousand workers will lose their jobs. He is a talent! Such a person should live in this world, and the responsibility to let him live is on you! Now you choose!"
    Here, the film exposes the thinking of the American rulers nakedly: protect the murderer because "he is a factory owner," and "sacrifice" the innocent black man because he is "worthless!" This is the logic of American politicians, and these words are said under the banner of "Washington" and "the interests of the American nation." This is how Lizzie was shocked.
    However, lies cannot replace facts. In the face of the facts, Lizzie realized that she and the black man are both "poor people." She bravely goes to testify with the black man Sidney, and she wants to expose all the truth! ... (Attached picture)
    Lizzie: "He is not guilty! I can prove he is not guilty!"

### 看影片“可尊敬的妓女”

    看影片“可尊敬的妓女”
    白景晟
    根据法国作家让·保尔·萨特的舞台剧改编的影片“可尊敬的妓女”，对美国资本主义制度充满着强烈的抗议的声音。它表达了正直人们正义的激愤；有力地揭露了那些美国大人先生们，在“民主、自由”的幌子下，所进行的罪恶活动，谴责了那些隐藏在“文明”假面具后面的二十世纪的野蛮行为。
    一个黑人，无缘无故地被杀了。凶手是克拉克议员的外甥泰弟，一个白人。初看，“杀人有罪”的法律并没有失效，凶手被拘禁起来。然而这些议员、警察、暗探，却在利用这个法律，极尽颠倒黑白之能事：明明是泰弟玩弄、污辱一个白人妓女丽茜，丽茜不能忍耐这种玩弄和纠缠，跑到黑人车厢去躲避，一个黑人无辜被泰弟杀死了。但他们却硬要丽茜说成是黑人想污辱她，泰弟为了维护这个白人妇女，才把黑人杀死的。总之把这个杀人的凶手，说成是一个抑强扶弱的英雄，来开脱凶手的罪行，来维护所谓“国家的尊严”。
    作者所选择的这个事件，是具有深刻的典型意义的。影片一方面揭露了美国的种族歧视，黑人生命的毫无保障，同时更进一步揭示出这种种族歧视的实质，不过是阶级压迫的另一种形式而已。
    影片中的克拉克议员和他的儿子弗莱特，就是这种“美国精神”的代表。就是这样的人在左右着美国人民的命运。影片通过了这一老一少、一父一子，向我们揭开了这些政客们的卑劣行径，资产阶级的丑恶面貌。
    我们看到，那位衣冠楚楚的青年绅士弗莱特，一方面在虚伪地维持着自己少爷的尊严，一方面却以“尊贵”的嫖客身份在丽茜那里做暗探活动，威胁丽茜做假证，丽茜虽然是个被人贱视的妓女，但她的心是正直的，她不愿违背事实和良心，不受利诱和威胁。在弗莱特和丽茜之间形成了强烈的对比：一个尽管是妓女，然而她的心是纯正的、洁白的；一个虽然是衣冠楚楚的议员少爷，但他的心是卑鄙和肮脏的。
    丽茜是那些被污辱与被迫害的下层妇女中间的一个，影片成功地塑造了这个人物。生活已经使她习惯于恭顺地承受人们对她的污辱，然而生活也磨练得她泼辣和充满敌意。对于龌龊的社会、龌龊的人和事，她的语调总是带着挑衅的意味。影片成功地把她的这种矛盾的气质揉合了起来。从而揭示出这个人物的真实的善良的本性。
    威胁、利诱、甚至拷打都没有使丽茜屈服，只有在克拉克议员那些什么“国家尊严”“白发老母”的美妙的言词下，丽茜被一时迷惑了。这种处理极为深刻。它说明了丽茜愿意人们像人一样尊敬她，她怜惜那个
  “将失去儿子的母亲”，而在这里议员克拉克恰恰是抓住了丽茜的这种心理，来达到了他的卑鄙的目的。
    影片中的克拉克议员确实是一个狡猾老练的政客。影片开始，我们便看到他为黑人孩子举行的慈善招待会，他抚摸着孩子们的额头，态度显得慈祥、和蔼，不啻是这些孤儿们的再生父母，然而事实揭穿了他的虚伪，这不过是他为自己的竞选所做的一桩政治买卖。
    他把丽茜像“上宾”一样招待到家中，口口声声叫着“丽茜，我的孩子！”甚至他也对丽茜的不做假证也表示首肯，说什么他甘愿牺牲自己的外甥。多么正直、多么公道！然而假话掩盖不了真面目，影片中克拉克议员在华盛顿的像前的那一套言论，一针见血地揭穿了他的企图是什么，“美国民主”的实质是什么。请听他说：
    “丽茜……你要在两个人之间挑选一个，其中一个要被消灭。……你想保护那一个黑人吗？他是偶然存在的、懒惰成性！终日游手好闲，活着有什么价值？如果消灭了，与社会毫无影响；相反另一个是泰弟！他是杀了一个黑人，不过即使如此，他是个纯粹的美国人，又是军人，他有个工厂养活着两千工人，他消灭了，两千个工人就要失业，他是人材！这样的人应当活在世上，而让他活下去的责任便在你！现在你挑选吧！”
    影片在这里，对于美国的统治者的思想，做了赤裸裸的暴露：要保护那个杀人凶手，因为“他是个工厂主”，要“牺牲”那个无辜的黑人，因为他“一文不值！”这就是美国政客们的逻辑，而且这些话是打着
  “华盛顿”“美国国家的利益”的旗号说出来的。就是这样，丽茜被镇慑住了。
    然而谎话代替不了事实，在事实面前，丽茜意识到自己和黑人一样都是“可怜的人”，她勇敢地和黑人悉得尼一起去作证，她要把事实的真象全部揭发出来！……（附图片）
    丽茜：“他没有罪！我可以证明他没有罪！”
