Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: With summer crops such as wheat, oilseeds, and early rice successively appearing on the market, good news about grain and oil procurement is pouring in from various provinces in southern China, and new grain and new oilseeds have begun to enter storage.

Summer crops in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, which have earlier harvest seasons, have now entered the full harvest stage; most areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are being harvested. Because various regions have adopted methods such as simultaneous harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting, the number of purchases is increasing daily. As of May 20th, the above-mentioned eleven provinces and autonomous regions have delivered seventy million jin of new grain to the state. By the 25th, nearly two hundred million jin of oilseeds had been put into storage, accounting for about 10% of this year's procurement plan.

In order to implement the spirit of simultaneous harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting, various regions have carried out a series of preparatory works in advance. The Provincial People's Committees, especially in the major summer crop producing provinces, instructed all regions as early as April to investigate yields, rationally distribute the unified purchase tasks to communes and production teams, and allocate procurement forces. The Shantou Prefectural Grain Bureau of Guangdong Province recently held specialized meetings on storage and transportation, processing, and other specialties, and made special studies on grain storage warehouses, grain inspection, and grain and oil processing. In order to save farmers' grain selling time and improve the efficiency of grain entering storage, grain departments in various parts of Guangdong have created, modified, and promoted more than 20,000 pieces of grain storage and handling tools. The inclined conveyor created by Kaiping County can transport 20,000 jin of grain into the warehouse per hour, which is more than six times higher than the efficiency of manual handling in the past. In Xincheng County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, because cadres from the county, communes, and production teams all participated in harvesting and purchasing work, a purchasing upsurge was quickly set off. They adopted the method of harvesting one piece, receiving one piece, threshing one piece, and weighing one piece, to ensure that harvesting was clean and thorough, and yields were verified; the collected grain was stored in separate warehouses according to public grain, ration grain, seeds, and feed; and strict revenue and expenditure systems were established. Therefore, the procurement of summer oilseeds in various regions has been carried out quickly and well.

The peasants, who have obtained their first summer harvest since communization, are in high spirits to deliver summer grain and oilseeds. Many communes, after the harvested wheat and rice are dried and winnowed, immediately organize forces to carry out a rush to transport them into storage. Some communes, because they conducted patriotic education among commune members, prioritizing the state over the commune, the commune members regarded completing the state procurement plan in advance as a glorious task. In many communes in Yunnan Province, commune members transported grain overnight. People's communes along the highways organized cattle carts and horse carts to truly achieve simultaneous harvesting and storage. In mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, communes are organizing cattle and horse transportation brigades to ensure that new grain enters storage as scheduled.

### 南方新粮新油入库量日增  十一个省区已交售了七千万斤新粮、近二亿斤油料

    南方新粮新油入库量日增
    十一个省区已交售了七千万斤新粮、近二亿斤油料
    据新华社29日讯　随着小麦、油料、早稻等夏季作物相继登场，我国南方各省粮、油收购捷报频传，新粮、新油料已开始入库。
    收获季节较早的广东、广西、福建、云南、贵州、四川的夏季作物，目前已进入全面收割阶段；江西、湖南、湖北、浙江、安徽等省大部分地区正在收割。由于各地采取了边收、边打、边征购、边运送等办法，收购数量与日俱增。截至5月20日，上述十一个省、自治区已向国家交售了七千万斤新粮。到25日止，有将近二亿斤油料入库，约占今年收购计划的10％。
    为了贯彻边收、边打、边购、边运的精神，各地事前都进行了一系列的准备工作。各省特别是夏季作物主要产区的省人民委员会，早在4月间就指示各地调查产量，把统购任务合理地分配到公社、生产队，并且配备收购力量。广东汕头专区粮食局最近召开了贮运、加工等专业会议，对储粮仓库、粮食检验、粮油加工等问题作了专门研究。为了节省农民售粮时间，提高粮食入库效率，广东各地粮食部门创造、改制和推广了二万多件保管粮食和搬运工具。开平县创造的斜型输送机，每小时可运送二万斤粮食入仓，比过去用人力搬运提高效率六倍以上。广西僮族自治区忻城县由于县、公社、生产队干部人人参加收割和收购工作，很快掀起收购高潮。他们采取熟一块、收一块、打一块、秤一块的办法，做到割好收净，产量核实；所收粮食及时按公粮、口粮、种子、饲料分仓储存；建立了严格的收支制度。因而，各地的夏种油料收购就都进行得又快又好。
    获得公社化以后第一次夏季丰收的农民，交售夏粮、油料的情绪都很高。不少公社当收割的小麦、稻谷晒干扬净以后，立即组织力量突击运送入库。有的公社由于对社员进行先国家后公社的爱国主义教育，社员群众都以提前完成国家征购计划当作光荣任务。云南省不少公社的社员，连夜运送粮食。沿公路的人民公社组织好牛车马车，真正做到边收、边入库。在交通不便的山区，公社正在组织牛马运输大队，保证新粮如期入库。
