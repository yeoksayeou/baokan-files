Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 29th. Since the beginning of spring, the broad masses of Hebei Province, relying on the power of the people's communes, have waged a tenacious struggle against the severe drought, achieving significant victories in spring plowing, sowing, and wheat field management.

	In the autumn and winter before last year and the spring of last year, Hebei experienced a continuous drought of 300 days. Although the soil moisture content was better in early spring this year than last year, rainfall in April and May was much less than in the same period last year. According to a survey of seven rainfall observation points in the province, rainfall in April was only 47.8% of the same period last year, and in the first and middle ten days of May, it was only 48.8% of the same period last year. Under these circumstances, all parts of the province made full use of various water conservancy facilities and launched a massive drought resistance campaign. A total of about nine million people in the province participated in drought resistance for spring planting and drought resistance for watering wheat. Leading cadres at all levels went to the front line to participate in and lead the drought resistance efforts together with commune members. In early May, when wheat urgently needed watering, the province watered more than 5.4 million mu of wheat from the 1st to the 6th. In many wheat fields that originally had no water source, commune members took water for irrigation by digging canals and wells. In Shexian County, Handan Prefecture, more than 94,000 laborers were mobilized to transport water by diverting water up the mountains, using carts and pack animals, and carrying water by hand. They watered the returning green water in more than 300,000 mu of wheat fields lacking water sources, watered the jointing water in 145,000 mu of wheat fields, and watered the heading and grain-filling water in more than 85,000 mu of wheat fields.

	This year's drought resistance movement has fully demonstrated the superiority of the people's communes. Many communes, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, organized various production teams to concentrate their efforts and rush to repair larger water conservancy projects that could not be built by a single village (team) in the past, ensuring the needs of drought resistance and irrigation. The Damafang Commune in Qingyuan District, Baoding City, drew more than 2,000 laborers from the directly benefiting production teams and, in just two days, dug a canal spanning the entire commune, 15 li long, diverting water from the reservoir to solve the water problem for more than 10,000 mu of wheat. In Lingshan and Chande, two mountainous communes in Ding County, some land lacked water sources. The management areas and teams of these two communes negotiated and decided to support each other, quickly organizing a drought resistance and sowing army of 20,000 people, who planted more than 9,800 mu of cotton and 4,100 mu of corn in just five days.

	After more than 100 days of hard work by the masses in the province, major victories have been achieved in drought resistance. At present, the province has planted more than 64 million mu of various spring-sown crops, accounting for about 80% of the province's spring sowing task. Among them, about 20% were sown after irrigation or by carrying water, and every effort was made to irrigate more than 30 million mu of wheat in the province. Large areas of high-yield fields, accounting for about 20% of the province's wheat fields, were watered five to seven times, reducing the impact of severe drought on wheat growth. At present, there is still no widespread rainfall in the province, and the struggle for drought resistance sowing and drought resistance seedling protection is still ongoing. Wheat in the northern and central regions is still filling grains, and the harvest is still uncertain. The broad masses of commune members in these regions are continuing to carry out late-stage field management, focusing on watering.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 28th. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, farmers in various parts of Liaoning have launched a mass movement to resist drought and rush to plant.

	Since entering May, there has been little rainfall in various parts of Liaoning, and the drought has gradually spread throughout the province, affecting even the sowing of large fields in some areas. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee attach great importance to this situation and have successively issued emergency instructions and convened telephone conferences since mid-May, requiring all localities to take all measures to sow with water, rush to plant, dig springs to divert water for irrigation, and resist drought to protect seedlings. In the southern and western counties where the drought is relatively severe, many places have mobilized men, women, old, and young to participate in the drought resistance struggle. Since mid-May, Xingcheng County has had more than 33,000 people every day racing against time to fight drought and sow seeds. The more than 5,000-strong drought resistance army of the Weiping People's Commune used large trucks to pull large tanks, buckets, oil drums, and all kinds of water-carrying tools to transport water for planting, drought-resistant planting in more than 4,900 mu of large fields in three days. Since mid-May, the Dalian area has listed drought resistance as one of the most urgent tasks at present. Guo Shushen, the first secretary of the Dalian Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, led more than 1,100 cadres from municipal organs, who went to rural areas on the 18th to help farmers carry out drought relief. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Dalian area also actively supported this struggle. The "August 1st" Reservoir was built by the officers and soldiers of the garrison a year ago. Now, the soldiers are using their own hands to draw water from the reservoir to help farmers irrigate their farmland.

	In order to prepare for a complete victory over the drought, many areas are using existing water sources to irrigate fields and vigorously explore new water sources. In some areas, in order to save water and protect seedlings, measures such as cultivating and weeding during the day and irrigating fields at night have also been taken. Because the Daxuan Production Team of the Liangshan People's Commune increased its water sources and irrigated the drought-stricken wheat fields twice, the wheat seedlings in these wheat fields are now growing lush and green.

    人民公社显威力　群众运动震山河
    河北辽宁抗旱初捷
    新华社天津29日电　今春以来，河北省广大群众依靠人民公社的力量，同严重的干旱展开了顽强的斗争，在春耕播种和小麦田间管理上取得了重大胜利。
    前年秋冬和去年春季，河北各地曾经连旱三百天。今年初春，土地墒情虽然比去年好，但4、5两月的雨量却比去年同期少得多。据全省七个雨量观测点的调查，4月份的降雨量只有去年同期的47.8％，5月上、中旬只有去年同期的48.8％。在这种情况下，全省各地充分利用各种水利设施，掀起了规模巨大的抗旱运动。全省投入抗旱春播和抗旱浇麦的劳动力，共达九百万人左右。各地各级领导干部都亲上前线，与社员一起参加抗旱，领导抗旱。5月初旬小麦急需浇水，全省从1日到6日就浇麦五百四十多万亩。许多原来没有水源的麦田，社员们用开渠、打井的办法，取水浇灌。邯郸专区的涉县，出动九万四千多名劳力，采取引水上山和车拉畜驮、人担人抬等办法运水，在三十多万亩缺乏水源的麦田中浇了返青水，在十四万五千亩麦田中浇了拔节水，在八万五千多亩麦田中浇了吐穗、灌浆水。
    今年的抗旱运动，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。许多公社根据等价交换的原则，组织各生产队，集中力量，抢修了过去一村（队）不能兴修的较大水利工程，保证了抗旱灌溉的需要。保定市清苑区大马坊公社从各直接受益的生产队抽调了二千多名劳力，只两天时间，就开挖了一条横贯全社、长达十五华里的水渠，从水库中引了水来，解决了一万多亩小麦的用水问题。定县灵山、产德两个山区公社，有一部分土地缺乏水源，这两个社的管理区与管理区、队与队分别进行协商，决定互相支援，很快组织起两万人的抗旱播种大军，只五天时间就种棉九千八百多亩，种玉米四千一百多亩。
    经过全省群众一百多天的奋战，各地的抗旱斗争已经取得重大胜利。现在全省已种各种春播作物六千四百多万亩，占全省春播任务的80％左右。其中经过浇灌播种和挑水点种的约占20％左右，对全省三千多万亩小麦也千方百计进行灌溉，占全省麦田面积约20％的大面积丰产方浇了五至七次水，减轻了严重干旱对小麦生长的影响。目前，全省仍未普遍降雨，抗旱播种和抗旱保苗的斗争仍在继续进行。北部、中部地区的小麦仍在灌浆长粒，收成还未定局，这些地区的广大社员，正以浇水为中心，继续进行后期田间管理。
    新华社沈阳28日电　辽宁各地农民在各级党委领导下，掀起了抗旱抢种的群众性运动。
    进入5月以来，辽宁各地雨水稀少，干旱现象逐渐扩延全省，有些地区甚至影响大田播种。中共辽宁省委和省人民委员会对于这个情况十分重视，5月中旬以来，先后发出紧急指示和召开电话会议，要求各地采取一切措施，坐水下种，突击抢种，挖泉引水浇地，抗旱保苗。目前旱象比较严重的南部和西部各县，许多地方男女老少一齐出动投入抗旱斗争。兴城县从5月中旬开始，每天有三万三千多人抢墒抗旱播种。围屏人民公社五千多名抗旱大军，使用大车拉着大缸、水桶、油桶等各种各样盛水工具，运水点种，在三天时间内抗旱播种大田四千九百多亩。旅大地区从5月中旬开始，已把抗旱斗争列为当前最紧要的任务之一，由中共旅大市委第一书记郭述申率领的一千一百多名机关干部，18日已分赴各地农村，帮助农民进行抗旱救苗。驻在旅大地区的解放军官兵，也积极支援了这一斗争，“八一”水库是驻军官兵一年前修建起来的，现在，战士们又用自己的双手，引出水库的水，帮助农民灌溉农田。
    许多地区为了准备彻底战胜干旱，一面利用现有水源灌田；一面大力挖掘新的水源。有些地区，为了节约用水，抗旱保苗，还采取了白天中耕除草，晚间灌田等措施。梁山人民公社大狟生产队因为增加了水源，给干旱的麦田灌过两次水，现在这些麦田里的麦苗，已经长得一片葱绿。
