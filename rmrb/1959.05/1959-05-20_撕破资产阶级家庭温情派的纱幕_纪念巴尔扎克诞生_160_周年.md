    Tearing off the Veil of Bourgeois Family Sentimentality
    —Commemorating the 160th Anniversary of Balzac's Birth
    Wang Jishen

    "The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his 'natural superiors,' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.'"
    (Marx & Engels, "The Communist Manifesto")

    "The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers." (Ibid.)
    
    Balzac’s "Human Comedy," a great work of realism, is like a continuous oil painting. With the central theme of exposing the power of money in the bourgeois society, which has the peculiar magic of making people corrupt, degenerate and even destroyed, "Old Goriot" is a vivid and brilliant fragment in this landscape.

    "Old Goriot" is a novel centered on the central figure of Jean-Joachim Goriot. Initially, he was a vermicelli maker. Later, he bought his master's shop and transformed himself. Once a person jumps into the cesspool of the bourgeoisie, the larva always wants to turn into a butterfly. During the famine years, he stepped on the backs of millions of hungry poor people and, through flour speculation, transformed into a nouveau riche. Fame and wealth are twin brothers. This vermicelli maker, reeking of money, wanted to climb even higher and squeeze into high society. He pinned this desire on his two daughters, giving each daughter an 800,000-franc dowry. He finally achieved his wish: the elder daughter married a count, and the younger daughter married a banker. In order to conceal his origins and give his two daughters, who had become wealthy ladies, some dignity, Goriot even reluctantly closed his vermicelli shop in 1813 and simply became a rentier. The extravagant Goriot was simply a prominent figure in the Maison Vauquer. Madame Vauquer, "actually forty-eight but admitting only to thirty-nine," felt a revival of old feelings and, on the night he moved into the apartment, began to "calculate in her sleep how to leave Vauquer's tomb and be reborn on Goriot's body." Then, this nearly middle-aged woman put on makeup and "armed herself" to attack Goriot. Our author's psychological analysis of Madame Vauquer is truly penetrating. He said, "She roasted this idea on the fire of lust, as if roasting a bamboo chicken covered in oil." In terms of property, she had 40,000 francs in savings, and she thought that marrying Goriot was "an excellent match."

    However, good times don't last. Goriot didn't stand at the peak of fame and fortune for long before he began to decline. When the two sons-in-law learned that their father-in-law was just a vermicelli maker from humble origins, they expressed their unwillingness to receive him anymore. From then on, he could not enter the halls and chambers, and like a beggar, he could only secretly visit his daughters from the corner of the door. What was even more terrible was that he was just sitting and eating, and Goriot's situation deteriorated year by year; he moved from the second floor of the apartment to the third floor, then to the fourth floor; from a monthly board and lodging fee of 100 francs, he reduced it to 45 francs; from "Monsieur Goriot" he was renamed "Old Goriot," until finally Madame Vauquer contemptuously called him a "relative" behind his back.

    Although the sons-in-law were unwilling to receive him, the insatiable daughters still often came to the apartment to "visit their parents," squeezing his money like lemons.

    Unfortunately, things finally happened. The "aristocratic rogue" elder son-in-law signed a 100,000-franc IOU outside, and when it was due, he couldn't pay it back. He was about to be sued, forcing his wife to sell the family heirloom diamonds to a Jewish merchant to repay 12,000. He viciously wanted to empty his wife's purse. The banker second son-in-law's real estate speculation failed, and in order to delay the liquidation, he wanted to use his wife's dowry and control his wife's property, and shamelessly proposed so-called "exchange conditions," in addition to sending away the dancing girls, he could also give his wife freedom, "do whatever you want."

    Both daughters went to Goriot for help, in reality, to squeeze money, but the old man's purse was almost empty. The elder daughter also forced him to pay back the 12,000 from his long-term savings that had already been spent, to pay off her husband's debts. Goriot felt that "the end of the world had come," and "there was no way but to steal." However, there was neither manpower nor time, so stealing was impossible. The only way left was death, so he banged his head against the wall.

    Goriot's illness and death is the climax of this novel.

    When Goriot was about to breathe his last breath, the two daughters were still late to see him off. The old man said intermittently: "Money can buy everything, buy daughters." "I want to protest, the father is trampled underfoot, won't the country perish?" When the elder daughter escaped from her husband's grasp and arrived, the old man was already convulsing and entering a dying state.

    Goriot's funeral was extremely desolate. No relatives were present, and it was non-relatives and non-friends, two college students and a waiter who lived together, who really took care of the funeral arrangements for him.

    Rereading "Old Goriot" and contemplating those two passages in the "Communist Manifesto," I deeply feel that Marx and Engels are truly the most correct interpreters of Balzac's works. In bourgeois society, the relationship between people, including family and flesh and blood, is a monetary relationship.

    Today is the 160th anniversary of Balzac's birth (he was born on May 20, 1799). His era is far from us, but rereading his works today still has great practical significance, because they are all powerful indictments against bourgeois society.

    Balzac's works are part of the great French national cultural heritage and also the wealth of progressive humanity around the world. Balzac will live forever!

### 撕破资产阶级家庭温情派的纱幕——纪念巴尔扎克诞生160周年

    撕破资产阶级家庭温情派的纱幕
    ——纪念巴尔扎克诞生160周年
    王季深
    “资产阶级在凡是它已达到统治的地方，就都把所有封建的、宗法的和醇朴的关系一一破坏。它无情地斩断了那些把人们系缠于其‘天然尊长’的复杂封建羁绊，它使人与人之间除了赤条条的利害关系之外，除了冷酷无情的‘现金交易’之外，再也找不出什么别的联系了”。
    （马克思、恩格斯：“共产党宣言”）
    “资产阶级撕破了家庭关系上面所笼罩着的温情脉脉的纱幕，并把这种关系化成了单纯金钱的关系”。（同上）
    伟大的现实主义作家巴尔扎克的“人间喜剧”，宛如一幅连绵不绝的油画，以揭露资产阶级社会中金钱所特具的使人腐朽、堕落以至毁灭的魔力为中心主题，“高老头”就是这幅风景画中栩栩如生、光彩夺目的一个片段。
    “高老头”这部长篇小说，以比尔·高里奥为中心形象。最初，他原是一名面条司务。后来，他盘下了东家的铺子，他就变了样。一个人只消跳进资产阶级这个臭水沟，幼虫总想化为蝴蝶。在大饥荒年代，他踩在千千万万饿瘪了肚子的贫民的身上，靠面粉投机一变而为暴发户。名利是一对孪生兄弟。这个满身铜臭味的面条司务，又想更上一层，挤到上流社会里去。他把这个欲念寄托在两个女儿身上，给每个女儿八十万法郎的赔嫁，终于如愿以偿，大女儿嫁给一个伯爵，小女儿嫁给一个银行家。为了要隐蔽自己的出身，给两个当了阔太太的女儿争点体面，高老头在1813年甚至忍痛把面粉铺子都给歇掉，索性做起寓公来了。举止阔绰的高老头，简直是伏盖公寓的显赫人物。“实际四十八岁而只承认三十九的”伏盖太太，也古井重波，在他搬进公寓的那天夜间，便在睡梦中“盘算怎样离开伏盖的坟墓，到高里奥身上去再生”。接着，这个年近百半的徐娘就涂脂抹粉“武装起来”，向高老头进攻。我们的作者，对于伏盖太太的心理分析真正入木三分。他说“她把这个念头放在欲火上烧烤，仿佛烤一只涂满油脂的竹鸡似的”。以财产而论，她有四万法郎的私蓄，她以为跟高老头结合起来，倒是“一门出色的亲事”。
    然而，好景不常，高老头在名利的极峰上站不多久，就开始走下坡路了。当两个女婿知道自己的丈人只是一名出身寒微的面条司务时，就表示不愿意再接待他了。从此他就不能登堂入室，好像乞丐一样，只能从门角里偷偷看望自己的女儿。更可怕的，是坐吃山空，高老头的景况也一年比一年败落了；他从公寓二楼搬到三楼，又是四楼；从每月一百法郎的膳宿费，降低到四十五个法郎；从“高里奥先生”被改称为“高老头”，以至最后伏盖太太以轻蔑的口吻背后叫他一声“家人”。
  尽管女婿不愿意接待他，欲壑难填的两个女儿还是常来公寓“省亲”，像挤柠檬似的，逼榨他的钱财。
    不幸的事情终于发生了，“贵族流氓”大女婿在外面签了十万法郎的借据，到期不还，眼看就要被告，逼着太太把家传的钻石卖给一个犹太商还欠一万二，恶狠狠地要掏光太太的钱袋；银行家二女婿经营地产投机失败，为了拖延清理，要动用太太的赔嫁，支配太太的产权，并且恬不知耻地提出所谓“交换条件”，除了自己打发舞女以外，还可以让太太自由，“爱怎办，就怎办”。
    两个女儿都到高老头处求援，实际是逼钱，可是干瘪老头子的钱袋快掏光了。大女儿还要逼他的已经花掉的长期存款一万二，给丈夫还债。高老头觉得“世界末日到了”，“没有办法，除非去偷”。但是，既无人手，又无时间，偷也不行了，剩下的一条路，就是死，于是，他把头往墙上撞。
    高老头的病和死是这部长篇小说的高潮。
    到高老头快要咽最后一口气的时候，两个女儿还迟迟不来送终。老头若断若续地说：“钱可以买到一切，买到女儿。”“我要抗议，做父亲的给踩在脚底下，国家不要亡了吗？”当大女儿逃出丈夫的手掌赶到时，老头已经抽搐，入于弥留状态了。
    高老头的葬仪是极悲凉的。没有一个亲人到场，真正给他办理善后的是非亲非眷，两个同住的大学生和一个茶房。
    重读“高老头”，掩卷思考“共产党宣言”里的那两段话，我深深感到，马克思和恩格斯实在是巴尔扎克作品最正确的论释者。资产阶级社会人与人包括家人骨肉的关系，都是金钱关系。
    今天是巴尔扎克诞生160周年纪念日（他生于1799年5月20日），他的时代距离我们已经很远，但我们今天重读他的作品，还有极大的现实意义，因为它们都是对资产阶级社会的有力的起诉书。
    巴尔扎克的作品是伟大的法兰西民族文化财产的一部分，也是全世界进步人类的财富。巴尔扎克永垂不朽！
