Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 21st: In the first and middle ten days of May, the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace achieved a double leap forward in quality and output. In the past twenty days, the average daily output of this blast furnace increased by 3.6% compared with the same period in April, and the qualified rate of pig iron reached 96.2%.

Since the beginning of May, the production of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace has been rising daily. The average daily output in the middle ten days increased by 8.3% compared with the first ten days, and the qualified rate of pig iron also increased from 94.7% to 97.7%. The ironworkers are in high spirits, full of fighting spirit, and confident in successfully completing the national plan.

In order to ensure high quality and high output of No. 1 Blast Furnace, all production plants and mines have carried out large-scale communist collaboration. The coking plant launched a mass movement to identify weak links, found more than 230 problems, and improved enterprise management work by addressing these problems, formulated post operation rules and responsibility systems, so that the operating rate increased from 92% to 98%. Therefore, the entire plant overfulfilled the national plan by 2.5% in the first and middle ten days of May, and the quality was excellent. Dazhi Iron Mine, without establishing a beneficiation plant for fine selection, mobilized the masses to take a series of technical measures to strengthen quality management, to ensure that no waste rock is sent down the mountain with the ore, so that the quality of ore supplied to No. 1 Blast Furnace has been greatly improved, and overfulfilled the task of supplying ore in the first ten days of May by 60%, strongly supporting Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace to achieve high quality and high output.

    武钢一号高炉出铁又好又多
    新华社武汉21日电　5月上、中旬，武钢一号高炉质量产量双跃进。二十天来，这座高炉的平均日产量比4月份同期增长了3.6％，生铁的合格率达到96.2％。
    进入5月以来，武钢一号高炉的生产天天上升，中旬的平均日产量比上旬提高8.3％，生铁合格率也由94.7％提高到97.7％。炼铁工人们情绪高涨，斗志昂扬，对胜利完成国家计划满怀信心。
    为了保证一号高炉优质高产，各生产厂矿都开展了共产主义的大协作。焦化厂掀起了群众性的查薄弱环节运动，共找出二百三十多个问题，并且针对这些问题改进企业管理工作，订立岗位操作规程和责任制，使作业率由92％提高到98％。因此全厂在5月上中旬超额2.5％完成了国家计划，而且质量优等。大冶铁矿在没有建立选矿厂的精选部分的情况下，发动群众采取一系列的技术措施加强质量管理，保证不让废石随矿下山，使供应一号高炉的矿石质量有了很大改进，并且超额60％完成了5月上旬供应矿石任务，有力地支援了武钢一号高炉达到优质高产。（附图片）
