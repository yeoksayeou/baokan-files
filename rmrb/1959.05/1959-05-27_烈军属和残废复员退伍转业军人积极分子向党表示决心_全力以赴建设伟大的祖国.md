Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The National Congress of Activists of Dependents of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, and Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Military Personnel in Socialist Construction continued its plenary sessions on the 23rd, 25th, and 26th. In their speeches, the representatives expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Party and the state for their meticulous care, and stated that they would always remember the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory"; always stand at the forefront of revolution and construction, and fight to the end for the cause of socialism and communism.

The speech of Huang Chuanren, a disabled soldier from Sichuan Province who lost both arms in the Korean War, was filled with love and gratitude for the Party. After Huang Chuanren was wounded and lost both arms, the Party organization of the hospital continuously helped and encouraged him, and gave him books such as "How Steel Was Tempered" and "The Legless Flying General." Under the care and education of the Party, and inspired by the heroic deeds, Huang Chuanren was determined to make himself a person who was disabled but not disabled in spirit. Without hands, he stubbornly learned to write and paint with a pen in his mouth. After he learned to write, he wrote a letter to the Party, saying: "Although I am disabled, my heart and brain are not disabled. I can still serve the people and work for the Party in the future." The Party organization at this time continued to encourage and help him, making him even stronger. After Huang Chuanren returned to his hometown, he worked tirelessly day after day using his mouth to draw propaganda posters, write quick reports and slogans, and composed many poems, becoming an outstanding propagandist in the rural Great Leap Forward. In his speech, he said that the little achievements I have made in propaganda work should first be attributed to the Party. He then recited a poem he wrote himself, which said: "Dear Party, I am a soldier you personally cultivated. Although I have lost both arms, I have a fiery heart, and I will use all my strength to build that beautiful hometown."

After Geng Fengming, a demobilized soldier from Shandong Province, returned from the army to participate in production at the Yantai Automobile Repair Factory, the Party organization of the factory was very concerned about his life, and often encouraged him to carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Army in his work and strive to create new achievements. Last year, when he was trial-producing the main component of the automobile, the "self-lubricating graphite bronze bearing," he encountered many difficulties due to lack of experience and data, so his mood was sometimes high and sometimes low. The Party branch secretary and the factory director learned about this and specifically helped him and encouraged him to experiment boldly. Finally, in more than forty days, he successfully trial-produced the "self-lubricating graphite bronze bearing" that used to be imported from abroad. Under the care and encouragement of the Party organization, he also created machine parts such as the "circular arc milling machine." In his speech, he said that through production practice, I deeply realized that with the leadership and care of the Party, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Zhao Songlin, a disabled soldier from Yunnan Province, introduced in his speech how he went from being a soldier who had not studied medicine to an outstanding doctor who benefited the people. After Zhao Songlin became disabled in the waist, the Party organization continuously encouraged him to be a person who was disabled but not useless. After he recovered from his injuries and returned to his hometown, the Party organization encouraged him to study medicine and treat the masses. When he encountered difficulties in his work, the Party organization encouraged him to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle of the People's Army and strive to overcome difficulties. In the past two years, under the constant encouragement and education of the Party, he has self-studied nineteen medical books, including traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment, and new internal medicine. Because he can conscientiously treat the masses, he is deeply loved by the masses. He said that I can learn some medical knowledge and do something for the people, mainly as a result of the Party's education and the support of the masses.

Some of the speakers at the conference were also representatives of advanced units in preferential treatment work. These advanced units have close ties with the dependents of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized soldiers, care about their lives, and actively organize them to participate in labor production, supporting them to make greater contributions in socialist construction. These representatives introduced the achievements they have made in their speeches.

In these three days, Yang Liping, He Ruisheng, Lin Youfu, Haman Zhi, Chen Guanghua, Xie Qiaoyue, Zhou Yunhe, Zhang Youyi, Song Xueyi, Shen Jilan, Wu Fusha Deque, Hu Zhanfang, Jin Yingzhu, Di Muguo Guo, Menghe Bayar and others also spoke at the conference. They unanimously stated that they are determined to strive for greater glory, go wherever the Party points, and always be advanced producers and advanced defenders of socialist construction. In their speeches, they also talked about the great achievements made in preferential treatment and demobilization work, and expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Party committees and administrative leaders of various places and units for their meticulous care and help.

    烈军属和残废复员退伍转业军人积极分子向党表示决心
    全力以赴建设伟大的祖国
    新华社26日讯  全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会23、25和26日继续进行大会发言。代表们在发言中衷心地感谢党和国家对他们的无微不至的关怀，并表示永远记住党和毛主席的指示：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”；永远站在革命和建设的最前线，为社会主义和共产主义事业奋斗到底。
    在朝鲜战争中失去双臂的四川省残废军人黄川仁的发言，充满了对党的热爱和感激。黄川仁负伤失去双臂以后，医院的党组织不断地对他进行帮助和鼓励，给他看“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“无脚飞将军”等书。黄川仁在党的关怀和教育下，在英雄事迹的鼓舞下，决心使自己成为身残志不残的人。他没有手，就顽强地学会了用嘴含笔写字和画画。他学会写字后，给党写了一封信，信上说：“我虽然残废了，但心和脑子还未残废，以后还能为人民服务，为党工作。”党组织在这时又不断地鼓励和帮助他，使他更加坚强。黄川仁回到家乡后，终日辛勤地用嘴画宣传画，写快报和标语，并编了很多诗歌，成为农村大跃进中的出色的宣传员。他在会上发言说，我在宣传工作上做出的一点成绩，首先应归功于党。他就在会上朗诵了一首他自己写的诗，诗中说：“亲爱的党，我是你亲手培养出来的一名战士。我虽然失去双臂，但我有一颗火热的心，我要用全身之力，建设那美丽的家乡。”
    山东省复员军人耿凤鸣从部队回到烟台汽车修理厂参加生产以后，工厂的党组织很关心他的生活，并常鼓励他在劳动中发扬人民军队的优良传统，努力创造新的成绩。去年，他在试制汽车上的主要机件“自润滑石墨青铜轴承”时，因为没有经验和资料，碰到很多困难，因而他的情绪时高时低。党支部书记和厂长知道了这件事情，就具体地帮助他，鼓励他大胆试验，终于在四十多天中试制成功过去要靠外国进口的“自润滑石墨青铜轴承”。在党组织的关怀和鼓励下，他还创造了“圆弧铣床”等机件。他在发言中说，通过生产实践，使我深深体会到：有了党的领导和关怀，没有克服不了的困难。云南省残废军人赵松林在发言中介绍了他怎样由一个没有学过医的军人变成一个为民造福的出色医生。赵松林腰部残废以后，党组织不断地鼓励他做一个残而不废的人。他养好伤回到家乡后，党组织又鼓励他学习医务，为群众治病。他在工作上遇到困难时，党组织又鼓励他发扬人民军队的艰苦奋斗的作风，努力克服困难。两年来，他在党的不断鼓励和教育下，共自学了中医诊疗、新内科学等十九本医书。由于他能够勤勤恳恳地为群众治病，深受群众爱戴。他说，我能学到一些医疗常识，替人民作一点事情，主要地是党的教育和群众支持的结果。
    大会发言的人中还有一些是优抚工作先进单位的代表。这些先进单位和烈属、军属、复员军人等有密切的联系，很关心他们的生活，并积极组织他们参加劳动生产，支持他们在社会主义建设中作出更大的贡献。这些代表在发言中介绍了他们作出的这些成绩。
    在这三天中，还有杨礼平、何瑞生、林有福、哈万智、陈光华、谢巧月、周云鹤、张有义、宋学义、申纪兰、吾甫沙德克、胡占芳、金英淑、抵目果果、孟和巴雅尔等在大会上发言。他们一致表示：决心争取更大光荣，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，永远做一个社会主义建设的先进生产者和先进保卫者。他们在发言中还谈到了优抚复员工作取得的巨大成绩，并衷心感谢各地各单位党委和行政领导上对他们的无微不至的关怀和帮助。
