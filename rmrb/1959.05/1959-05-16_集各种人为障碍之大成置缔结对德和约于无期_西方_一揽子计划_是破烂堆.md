Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 15th (By our correspondent Peng Di) The Western "package plan" proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Herter at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is nothing but a heap of rubbish, encompassing every obstacle thrown out by Western countries to prevent Eastern and Western countries from reaching an agreement.

    This "package plan" actually entangles all the outstanding issues from "general disarmament, European security" to "European political settlement" and puts them forward as "an indivisible whole." This is a clear attempt by Western countries, especially the United States, West Germany, and France, to undermine any effort made to resolve any one of these individual issues.

    The "package plan" includes long-standing unresolved issues such as general disarmament. Representatives from the East and West have been discussing this issue at the negotiating table for more than a decade, but it is still far from being resolved. U.S. Secretary of State Herter also acknowledged in his speech proposing this "package plan" that issues related to disarmament remain the "most serious difficulty." However, he went on to emphasize that all these issues must be resolved as a whole. He said, "Just as the Berlin issue is part of the larger German problem, the entire German problem itself is part of an even larger problem." This statement clearly shows that he is deliberately trying to expand and complicate the issue so that none of the problems can be solved.

    Therefore, this "package plan" will be bottomless, and none of the issues included in it can be resolved.

    Western countries now emphasize that the German question must be closely linked to general disarmament for resolution. However, not long ago, during the disarmament negotiations, Western countries emphasized that no agreement could be reached on disarmament without an agreement on the German question. Obviously, they are using this chain reaction to obstruct any progress in resolving the German question and disarmament as well.

    According to the Western "package plan," the urgent issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany is postponed to the very end. It emphasizes that German reunification and European security are prerequisites for concluding a treaty. But until the opening of the current Foreign Ministers' Conference, Western countries rejected the Soviet Union's many positive proposals on European security. All this fully proves that Western countries want to postpone the conclusion of a treaty indefinitely so that the United States and West Germany can continue to complete their nuclear armament plans as they please.

    The Western proposals show that Western countries not only refuse to abandon their rights to military occupation in West Berlin and West Germany, but also want to legitimize these rights.

    The Western plan emphasizes the reunification of Germany as a prerequisite for concluding a peace treaty with Germany, thereby setting up a huge roadblock. But this is an issue that needs to be discussed and decided by the German people themselves, and the Four Powers cannot impose any solution on them. The Soviet Union has indicated that it will not discuss this issue in Geneva.

### 集各种人为障碍之大成置缔结对德和约于无期  西方“一揽子计划”是破烂堆

    集各种人为障碍之大成置缔结对德和约于无期
    西方“一揽子计划”是破烂堆
    新华社日内瓦15日电　本社记者彭迪报道：美国国务卿赫脱在日内瓦外长会议上提出的西方“一揽子计划”不过是个破烂堆，它包罗了西方国家为了阻挠东西方国家达成协议而抛出的每一种障碍。
    这个“一揽子计划”实际上把从“普遍裁军、欧洲安全”到“欧洲政治解决”一切悬而未决的问题都纠缠在一起，而作为“一个不可分割的整体”提出来。这是西方国家，特别是美国、西德和法国这样的一个明显的企图：破坏为了解决其中任何一个单独的问题而作的任何努力。
    这个“一揽子计划”包括了像普遍裁军这样的长期悬而未决的问题。这个问题东西方代表已经在会议桌上讨论了十年多了，可是仍然远没有达成协议。美国国务卿赫脱在提出这个“一揽子计划”的发言中也承认，与裁军有关的问题仍然是“最严重的困难”。但是，他接下去强调说，所有这些问题都必须作为一个整体来解决。他说，“正如柏林问题是更大的德国问题的一部分一样，整个德国问题本身是甚至更大的问题的一部分”。他这句话清楚地说明，他处心积虑地要使这个问题扩大和复杂化，以便让问题一个也解决不了。
    因此，这个“一揽子计划”将是没有底的，其中所包括的任何一个问题都不可能得到解决。
    西方国家现在强调说，德国问题必须同普遍裁军密切联系起来加以解决。但是不久以前，在裁军谈判期间，西方国家强调说，没有就德国问题达成协议，就不能就裁军问题达成协议。很明显，他们正在利用这种连环套在解决德国问题、也在裁军问题方面阻挠取得任何进展。
    按照西方的“一揽子计划”，缔结对德和约这个迫切问题给推到最后去了。它强调德国重新统一和欧洲安全是缔结和约的先决条件。但是直到目前的外长会议开幕之前，西方国家拒绝了苏联关于欧洲安全的许多积极建议。这一切充分证明西方国家想要无限期地搁置缔结和约的问题，以便使美国和西德能够继续随心所欲地完成它们的核武装计划。
    西方的建议表明，西方国家不但拒绝放弃它们在西柏林和西德实行军事占领的权利，而且还想要使这种权利合法化。
    西方计划强调把重新统一德国作为缔结对德和约的先决条件，就从而设下了一个巨大的路障。但是这是一个需要由德国人民自己来讨论和决定的问题，四大国不能把任何解决办法强加在他们头上。苏联已经表明：它不在日内瓦讨论这个问题。
