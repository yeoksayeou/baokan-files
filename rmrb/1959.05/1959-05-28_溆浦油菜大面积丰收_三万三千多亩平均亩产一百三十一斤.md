Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 27th: Xupu County, Hunan Province, which had an average yield of 102 jin of rapeseed per mu last year, has achieved another large-scale bumper harvest on its 52,000 mu of rapeseed this year. According to statistics from eleven communes including Mayangshui, Xiaohenglong, and Jiangdong, 33,936 mu of rapeseed that have already been threshed yielded a total of 4,445,616 jin of dry rapeseed, with an average yield of 131 jin per mu.

The good news of the bumper harvest has inspired the people, and commune members of various people's communes are continuing to rush to harvest and thresh with joy. More than 400 male and female members of the Daxin Brigade of the Mayangshui Commune, while rushing to harvest the high-yield rapeseed plots, sang: "Get up early before dawn, the rapeseed fields are like battlefields, the sound of sickles never stops, enthusiasm soars to the sky with joy." Wielding their sickles, they harvested 229.61 mu of rapeseed in half a day. After threshing, drying, and weighing, they harvested a total of 41,855.8 jin of rapeseed, with an average yield of more than 182 jin per mu. During the rush harvest, all communes paid great attention to careful harvesting and threshing, striving to bring every grain home. Many communes re-threshed and re-sieved the branches and pods that had already been threshed. The Shuidong Commune re-threshed the branches and pods from an area of 2,152 mu, obtaining a total of 35,824 jin of rapeseed, and re-sieved a portion of the pods, obtaining a total of 2,012 jin of rapeseed.

The main reason for Xupu County's bumper rapeseed harvest this year is the further implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture throughout the production process. The rapeseed fields of various communes were generally deeply ploughed to a depth of seven or eight inches, with some high-yield fields being ploughed to a depth of more than one foot. The superior "Victory" rapeseed variety was further promoted. A reasonable close planting density of 10,000 to 12,000 plants per mu was generally implemented. Each mu of land was given more than 160 dan of base fertilizer. The county also launched a mass high-yield movement, with high-yield teams in every commune and high-yield plots in every team, forming a high-yield network. In terms of cultivation and management, various communes organized professional teams to ensure diligent weeding, drainage, and topdressing, and to tightly grasp the three key stages of planting, management, and harvesting. Commune members also displayed the spirit of hard work, skillful work, and practical work, overcoming natural disasters such as wind, snow, hail, diseases, and insect pests. For example, the rapeseed of the Daxin Brigade of the Mayangshui Commune was hit by wind, snow, and hail in late February. Some of the seedlings were knocked down. They mobilized more than 1,000 commune members, battled hard for two days, gently sweeping the accumulated snow off the leaves, straightening the seedlings, and quickly applying fertilizer to prevent freezing and keep them warm. They organized three major encirclements and suppressions of aphids and other insect pests. During the flowering and pod-setting period of the rapeseed, sclerotinia and soft rot began to appear in the high-yield plots. Commune members concentrated their efforts and removed all the yellow leaves and diseased plants within two days, finally stopping the spread of the disease and winning a bumper rapeseed harvest.

After the first shot of the rapeseed bumper harvest was fired, the enthusiasm of the people throughout the county was even greater. A summer production upsurge has already formed in various communes. In addition to continuing to rush to harvest and thresh rapeseed, the county is also mobilizing more than 260,000 laborers every day to intensively expand the planting of miscellaneous grain crops, rush to transplant intermediate rice, and strengthen the field management of early and intermediate rice, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain crops and cash crops in both the summer and autumn seasons.

    溆浦油菜大面积丰收
    三万三千多亩平均亩产一百三十一斤
    新华社长沙27日电  去年平均亩产油菜籽一百零二斤的湖南省溆浦县，今年五万二千亩油菜又获得大面积丰收。据麻阳水、小横垅、江东等十一个公社统计，已经脱粒的三万三千九百三十六亩油菜，共收干菜籽四百四十四万五千六百一十六斤，平均亩产一百三十一斤。
    丰收的喜讯，鼓舞了人们，各人民公社社员们正在喜气洋洋地继续抢收抢打。麻阳水公社大新大队四百多个男女社员在抢收丰产片的油菜时，边收边唱道：“清早起来天不亮，油菜田里当战场，镰刀响声不间断，干劲冲天喜洋洋。”他们飞舞着镰刀，半天光景就抢收了二百二十九亩六分一厘油菜，经过脱粒晒干过秤，共收菜籽四万一千八百五十五斤八两，平均亩产一百八十二斤多。在突击抢收中，各公社都很注意细收细打，力争颗粒还家。许多公社还把打过的枝、荚复打复筛了一次。水东公社复打了二千一百五十二亩面积的枝荚，共得菜籽三万五千八百二十四斤，复筛了一部分荚壳，共得菜籽二千零一十二斤。
    溆浦县今年油菜获得丰收的主要原因，是在整个生产过程中进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。各公社的油菜田，一般都深耕七、八寸，有的丰产田深耕一尺多深；进一步推广了胜利油菜良种；普遍推行了一万到一万二千株的合理密植；每亩田都施足底肥一百六十多担。全县还开展了群众性的丰产运动，社社有丰产队，队队有丰产片，形成了丰产网。在培育管理方面，各公社都组织了专业队，做到了勤锄草、勤排水、勤追肥，抓紧了种、管、收三关。各公社社员还发挥了苦干巧干实干的精神，战胜了风雪、冰雹、病虫等自然灾害。例如麻阳水公社大新大队的油菜，在2月下旬遭到了风雪、冰雹的袭击，一部分菜苗被打倒了，他们就出动一千多个社员，苦战两天，将叶子上的积雪轻轻的扫下去，把苗扶正，又迅速追肥，进行防冻保温。组织社员进行三次大围剿，彻底歼灭了蚜虫等虫害，油菜开花结荚时期，菌核病、软腐病在丰产片内开始露头，社员们集中力量在两天内把所有的黄叶、病株全部拔除，终于制止了病害，争得油菜丰收。
    油菜丰收的第一炮打响以后，全县人民的干劲更足了。夏季生产高潮已在各公社形成，除了继续抢收抢打油菜外，全县每天还出动二十六万多劳动力，紧张地扩种杂粮作物，抢插中稻和加强早中稻的田间管理，力争夏、秋两季粮食作物和经济作物获得全面丰收。（附图片）
