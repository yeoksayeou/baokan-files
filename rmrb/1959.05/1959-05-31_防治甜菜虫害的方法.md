Methods for Preventing and Controlling Sugar Beet Pests

The main pests during the sugar beet seedling stage are chafers (*Anomala orientalis*), grubs (*Heptophylla davidis*), weevils (*Tanymecus dilaticollis*) and cutworms. Farmers in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia have accumulated rich experience in preventing and controlling sugar beet pests. Their methods are as follows:

    Controlling Chafers: In Kangjin Commune, Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, last year, 4 liang of 6% BHC powder per mu was mixed with 50 times the amount of fine soil and applied to the seedling holes on windless days. The insecticidal rate was over 95%. Using this method, one person can treat more than 30 mu per day using a "point calabash" applicator. Alternatively, shake poplar and elm trees at dusk to capture and kill the mating adults; or insert poplar, elm, or willow branches soaked in BHC into the sugar beet fields in the afternoon to lure and kill them.

    Controlling Weevils: In Tiemao Township, Tumote Banner, Inner Mongolia, a ditch one foot deep and eight inches wide is dug to prevent the spread of the pest, targeting the early-stage weevils' crawling behavior for feeding. Alternatively, spray with a 150-fold solution of 6% BHC liquid at a height of one foot above the ground to kill them.

    Controlling Grubs: The best method is to apply the pesticide into the soil at a depth of two inches (2-3 jin of 6% BHC powder per mu). The effect can last for half a year and also control other underground pests. When larvae occur in June, you can also search for damaged seedlings in the early morning and kill the insects.

The key to controlling sugar beet pests is early treatment. The pest control experience of the Youth Shock Brigade of Lianfeng Commune in Longxi County, Gansu Province, which achieved a high yield of more than 30,000 jin per mu on 13.32 mu last year, is "treat when there are pests, prevent when there are no pests, and emphasize prediction and forecasting." This team took soil samples every ten days during the seedling stage to check for insect eggs, and immediately eliminated them upon discovery. Therefore, their sugar beet fields had complete and strong seedlings. (Attached picture)

    防治甜菜虫害的方法
    甜菜苗期的主要害虫有瞎撞子（东方金龟?）、蛴?（朝鲜黑金龟?）、象鼻虫（放羊牛牛）、地老虎等。黑龙江、吉林和内蒙古农民在防治甜菜虫害上有许多经验，他们的防治方法是：
    防治瞎撞子：黑龙江省呼兰县康金公社去年每亩地用6％六六六粉四两，掺五十倍细土，在无风天气，点入苗眼，杀虫率在95％以上。用这种办法一人一天用“点葫芦”可点三十多亩。也可以在黄昏时，摇动杨树、榆树，捕杀正在交配的成虫；还可以在午后二时，用浸过六六六的杨树、榆树、柳树枝插在甜菜地里诱杀。
    防治象鼻虫：内蒙古土默特旗铁帽乡，针对象鼻虫初期依靠爬行觅食的特点，挖一尺深八寸宽的防虫沟，用来杜绝虫害蔓延。也可以用一百五十倍的6％六六六药液，在距地面一尺处喷杀。
    防治蛴?：最好是将药施入二寸深土内（每亩用6％六六六粉二、三斤），药效可保持半年，并有兼治其他地下害虫的功效。当6月幼虫发生时，也可以在清晨寻找被害苗把虫子杀死。
    防治甜菜害虫的关键是早治。去年在十三点三二亩上获得亩产三万多斤高产的甘肃省陇西县莲丰公社青年突击队的治虫经验，就是“有虫治，无虫防，强调预测预报。这个队在苗期每十天即抽取土样检验虫卵一次，一有发现，立即消灭。因此，他们的甜菜田苗全苗壮。（附图片）
