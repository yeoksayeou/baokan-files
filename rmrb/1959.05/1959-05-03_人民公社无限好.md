The People's Commune is Infinitely Good
Representative Liu Shuqing refutes the imperialist slander against the people's commune with vivid facts and sends a message to overseas relatives and friends not to easily believe enemy rumors.
Fellow representatives:
I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I fully support the correct measures taken by our government to quell the rebellion of the reactionary clique in Tibet, firmly oppose the Indian expansionists' interference in our internal affairs, and pay tribute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its rapid annihilation of the Tibetan bandits.
I am an industrialist and businessman, and I am participating in this National People's Congress with great excitement.
The People's Republic of China has been established for only ten years, but under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it has experienced a series of significant changes. 1958 was the most extraordinary year in the ten years since the founding of the country, a year of rapid development in China's industrial and agricultural production, as well as cultural and educational undertakings, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. The most extraordinary event in this most extraordinary year was the rural people's communization.
Our people across the country wholeheartedly support this new form of social organization, the people's commune, which possesses strong vitality. However, the imperialists have slandered and provoked it in every possible way, causing my relatives and friends abroad to misunderstand it, harbor heavy concerns, and mistakenly believe various rumors that people are being "treated as slaves to work." They have repeatedly written to me saying, "I hear you have to participate in labor, and I am filled with fear and dread, as if a knife is piercing my heart," and so on.
What exactly is the people's commune? I would like to talk about my feelings on this matter.
Recently, I participated in the inspection work of the National People's Congress representatives in Yunnan Province and visited two people's communes in the suburbs of Kunming, namely the Xianfeng People's Commune and the Ala People's Commune.

Xianfeng People's Commune

It is a flatland area located on the shore of Dianchi Lake, with 58,670 mu of cultivated land and a population of 49,786 people. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and after communization, 1,128 water conservancy projects were built, including two medium-sized reservoirs, increasing the irrigated area by 3,530 mu and improving the area by 7,500 mu. In 1959, the area benefiting from irrigation was 14,000 mu. The water conservancy projects built in 1958 exceeded the total of those built before liberation by 1.3 times. The entire commune has completely realized water conservancy and self-flowing irrigation. In terms of fertilization, the average application of fertilizer per mu in 1958 was 15,000 jin, an increase of 3.25 times compared to the average application of fertilizer per mu in 1957. Due to the increase in water and fertilizer, the selection of seeds, planting techniques, reform of tools, and strengthened field management measures, the entire commune achieved an overall bumper harvest. The average yield of grain per mu in 1958 was 960 jin, an increase of 11.2 percent compared to the average yield of 860 jin per mu in 1957. This increase was calculated even though the area sown with grain was reduced by 3,435 mu due to the vegetable supply task. Here we saw wheat with long ears and plump grains, more than 6,000 mu of vegetable land for self-sufficiency and supplying the needs of urban people, glass greenhouses for cultivating vegetable seedlings, nearly 500,000 trees and fruit trees, and nurseries for cultivating forest and fruit trees covering 70 mu; newly opened fish ponds covering 200 mu. The fish fry that were released into these ponds last year yielded more than 10,000 kilograms in a single harvest this year. In terms of industry, we visited 114 large and small factories run by the commune, including 46 serving the commune's production, such as factories for making iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and ball bearings; 26 serving the commune members' lives, such as sewing and shoe-making factories; and 42 serving urban construction, such as brick and tile, cement, and refractory material factories.
In terms of welfare, culture, education, and health: free meals were implemented, and children's enrollment in nurseries and schools was free. The entire commune was dining hall-ized and nursery-ized, with 105 collective dining halls, 81 kindergartens, 91 nurseries, 22 primary schools, and one middle school. All children of school age were enrolled. Every child's body developed healthily and sturdily. Every collective dining hall I saw was clean and hygienic. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, it would have been difficult to imagine that the patriotic health campaign in the countryside could be so thoroughly implemented. The cooks all wore white hats and white aprons. The spring in Kunming comes earlier than in some other regions. At the beginning of April in the solar calendar, it used to be the season for flies to breed, but I didn't find a single fly in the dining halls. This is because after the establishment of the commune, livestock were classified and handed over to breeding farms for feeding, and the construction and management of the breeding farms also possessed various sanitary conditions. This fact embodies the correctness of the Party's policy of grasping production with one hand and life with the other. While visiting the collective dining halls, I also saw families, fathers and sons, and even three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, each sitting around clean tables, eating white rice and steaming hot steamed buns. In addition to the delicious vegetables supplied by the commune, some also brought fresh fish and meat, vegetables, and pickles. Some dining halls also had small shops. After work, families enjoyed the pleasures of life in harmony. The commune also ran amateur literacy classes, cultural centers, libraries, theaters, clubs, and privately run bookstores, as well as eight rural hospitals, one central hospital, and six maternal and child health stations. Some villages used hydropower to light electric lights, and some used biogas to generate electricity for lighting.

Inspection of the Ala People's Commune

I will only mention two situations that are different from the Xianfeng People's Commune. First, we visited the iron smelting plant. This commune is located in a semi-mountainous and mountainous area, which produces iron ore. The commune implemented the Party's policy of adapting to local conditions and using local materials. During the great battle for steel last year, it displayed soaring enthusiasm, broke superstitions, liberated its thinking, and, with the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, succeeded in smelting iron after 19 experiments. It increased from one small earthen furnace to 800 small earthen furnaces, producing 1,696 tons of iron, contributing to the 10.7 million tons of steel. Today, these earthen furnaces have all been transformed into small converters, and they are now working hard for this year's steel task.
Second, we visited a new village that Ala Township is currently building. Their plan is to focus on completing this new village in 1959, with a total of 87 large buildings, and to merge and relocate 4,000 farmers from 13 natural villages. They will also build seven dining halls, one hospital, one middle school, and one primary school, one cinema, department stores, post and telecommunications offices, banks, brigade offices, bathhouses, and hostels. Two Western-style buildings have already been completed, all of which are brick-wood structures. The drawings of the houses were made after soliciting the opinions of the local Sani farmers, and they are completely suitable for the reunion of families, young and old. This kind of large-scale new village in the countryside is the first I have ever seen. This is the direction of the new countryside in the future, and similar constructions will follow one after another. And what was the situation of the farmers there in the past? They were subjected to the cruel exploitation and oppression of feudal landlords, coupled with the ravages of soldiers and bandits. Their lives were extremely difficult, struggling on the brink of starvation all year round. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in a short period of time, the farmers not only solved the problem of food and clothing that they had worried about day and night for generations but also enjoyed such a happy life.
During my visit, I saw that every commune member was filled with joy and hope, working with a spirit of practicality, hard work, and ingenuity. The songs they sang expressed their feelings and the great ambition to change nature:
1. Spring arrives, and the flowers are fragrant. While hoeing wheat, we sing. Thinking of the harvest, we forget our fatigue. The greater our energy, the sweeter our hearts.
2. Hoeing and carrying, everyone is enthusiastic about production. Changing customs and habits to engage in production, we do not hesitate to work hard.
3. Things are changing day by day. Working hard and cleverly, we make great contributions. The countryside is becoming like a city, and the city and the countryside are connected.
4. Constantly revolutionizing and striving for the upper reaches, the iron tree blossoms and the water flows backward. We must resolutely revolutionize the spring harvest and spread the good news of high yields around the world.

From what I saw, I received a profound socialist education, which demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. It has made it possible for the young to be cared for, the strong to be employed, the old to be supported, and the widowed, lonely, and disabled to be provided for. This is something that predecessors and any capitalist country cannot do. From this, I deeply realized that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is the source of happiness for our people of all ethnic groups. Comparing the lives of the working people today with the era of reactionary rule, it is truly the difference between heaven and earth, incomparable. And from this, I deeply realized why the working people would fight with such great energy, enthusiastically and jubilantly, on the production front during the Great Leap Forward and after communization, and establish an inseparable emotional bond with the socialist cause. This is because our labor today is not only for ourselves but also for the happiness of ourselves and our descendants. No one is exploiting, oppressing, or enslaving us. The working people have become masters of themselves, and therefore their energy soars to the sky. The kind of treating people as slaves to work exists in imperialist countries. This kind of sinful behavior will never exist in our China. Here, I would like to send a message to my relatives and friends abroad: do not mistakenly believe the slander of those with ulterior motives. They cannot speak good things.
The imperialists are panicked and dismayed by our people's communization movement, which has aroused their resentment and hatred. This is because the people's communization movement shows that the Chinese people have already mastered their own destiny, and 650 million people are better organized nationwide. The cause of national construction will therefore develop faster and better, so our country will become even stronger. This fact will inevitably enhance the belief of people all over the world in the superiority of socialism. The imperialists are of course afraid of such things.
Dulles once attacked the people's commune with all his might, saying that "the communization plan is a slave labor plan on a scale unprecedented in world history that sacrifices human dignity," that "individuality and personality are subjected to barbaric suppression," and that "family life is destroyed," etc. However, the facts are there, and discerning people know it. Dulles's slander is not worth refuting. As for slandering us for destroying the family system, what we are destroying is the feudal family system, and what we are establishing is a democratic and harmonious happy family. Only after the capitalist system of exploiting people is eliminated can such families become widespread. The communes run nurseries, kindergartens, and collective dining halls to facilitate women's participation in social production, thoroughly liberating women from the cooking stove and the children's pile. Therefore, our women of all ethnic groups are applauding and are willing to devote all their efforts to the socialist cause.
Our good things are precisely the things that our enemies hate the most. This is very clear. Our cause is a just cause, and a just cause must flourish, and those who try to reverse the wheels of history have fallen one by one and will continue to fall one by one.
The Xianfeng and Ala people's communes that we inspected certainly had some shortcomings in the process of development. The problem is that the people's commune is a new thing, and the experience of the leaders and the masses is still insufficient. In its early stages, it is inevitable that there will be some temporary difficulties or individual shortcomings in its work. This is not surprising. However, after the rectification in recent months, the principles of unified leadership, classified management, classified accounting, and distribution according to labor have been implemented, and the people's commune has become more consolidated. Just as the farmers of Ala Township sang: "Communism is paradise, and the people's commune is the bridge," these two communes, like all the communes in the country, are marching towards their great goals.
The achievements of our country in the past ten years have undoubtedly proved that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is correct, and the Party's line, policies, and policies are completely in line with the reality of the Chinese revolution and construction, and completely in line with the interests of the 650 million people. I must follow the instructions given to industrialists and businessmen by Premier Zhou Enlai in his report, and earnestly continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation in the work of actively participating in socialist construction, and contribute my life's strength to the socialist cause.

    人民公社无限好
    刘淑清代表用活生生的事实驳斥帝国主义对人民公社的诬蔑，并寄语国外亲友勿轻信敌人谰言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。我完全拥护我国政府平定西藏反动派叛乱的正确措施，坚决反对印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政，并向迅速歼灭西藏叛匪的中国人民解放军致敬。
    我是一个工商业者，我怀着十分兴奋的心情参加这一次全国人民代表大会。
    中华人民共和国建国不过十年，但在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，已经历了一系列的重大变化。一九五八年是建国十年中最不平凡的一年，是我国在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，工农业生产和文化教育事业飞跃发展的一年，而这最不平凡的一年中，最不平凡的一件事，就是农村人民公社化。
    我们全国人民对这新的社会组织形式，富有强大生命力的人民公社，无不竭诚拥护和支持，但帝国主义者对此则百般诬蔑和挑拨，致使我在国外的亲友对此多所误解，顾虑重重，误信把人民“当奴隶去劳动”的种种谣言，屡次来信说：“听说您们要参加劳动，我就心惧胆寒，犹如刀刺我的心一样”等等。
    人民公社究竟是怎么一回事呢？我想对这一件事谈谈我的感受。
    最近我参加全国人民代表大会代表在云南省的视察工作，曾经访问过昆明郊区的两个人民公社，一是先锋人民公社，一是阿拉人民公社。
    先锋人民公社
    为平坝区，位于滇池之滨，有耕地五万八千六百七十亩，有人口四万九千七百八十六人。在一九五八年大跃进中和公社化后，兴修了水利一千一百二十八项，其中有中型水库两个，增灌的面积为三千五百三十亩，改善的面积为七千五百亩，一九五九年受益灌溉的面积为一万四千亩，一九五八年兴修的水利比解放前兴修水利的总和多一点三倍，全社已完全实现水利化、灌溉自流化。施肥方面，一九五八年每亩平均施肥一万五千斤，比一九五七年每亩平均施肥增长了三点二五倍。由于水、肥的增加，选种、栽种技术、工具的改革和加强了田间管理措施，整个公社获得全面的丰收。一九五八年平均亩产粮食九百六十斤，比一九五七年平均亩产八百六十斤增加了百分之十一点二，而这个增产数字，还是因蔬菜供应任务，种粮面积减少了三千四百三十五亩的数字计算的。我们在这里看见了穗长粒圆的小麦；社员自给和供应城市人民生活需要的六千多亩蔬菜地，育蔬菜苗的玻璃温室；近五十万株的树木林和果木林及七十亩培养林木果园的苗圃；新辟二百亩大的养鱼塘，这塘子，去年才撒下去的鱼秧，今年在一次收获中就有一万多公斤。在工业方面我们参观了公社举办的一百一十四个大小工厂，其中有服务于公社生产的四十六个如铁、木、竹农具和化学肥料、农药制造厂、滚珠轴承厂等；服务于社员生活的二十六个如缝衣、制鞋厂等；服务于城市建设者四十二个，如砖瓦、水泥、耐火材料厂等。
    生活福利和文教卫生方面：实现了吃饭不要钱，儿童入托儿所、入学不要钱，全社食堂化、托儿化，有集体食堂一百零五个，有幼儿园八十一个，托儿所九十一个，二十二个小学、一个中学，适龄儿童都入了学。儿童们个个身体都发育得健壮结实。在我所看到的每个集体食堂都是清洁卫生的，如非亲眼看见很难设想在农村的爱国卫生运动会贯彻得那么彻底。炊事员们都是戴着白帽子，穿着白围裙。昆明的春季比较有些地区来得早，在阳历的四月初，过去来说正是苍蝇孳生的季节，但在食堂内我就没有发现一只苍蝇。这是因为公社成立后把牲畜分门别类交到饲养场去饲养了，而对饲养场的建盖和管理也具备了各种卫生条件。这一事实体现党一手抓生产，一手抓生活政策的正确。在参观集体食堂中，我还看见家家户户的家人父子，有的是祖孙三代各围坐在一张一张的清洁桌子上，吃着白生生的大米饭、热喷喷的大馒头，除公社供给的可口菜蔬外，有的还带了鲜鱼肉、蔬菜、咸菜等，有的食堂还有小卖部。一家人在工作之后，融融睦睦地享受人生之乐。公社还举办了业余扫盲班、文化馆、图书室、剧院、俱乐部、民办书店，有乡村医院八个、中心医院一个，妇幼保健站六个。有些村子利用水力发电点上了电灯，有的用沼气发电而得到照明。
      对阿拉人民公社的视察
    我仅举两桩与先锋人民公社不同的情形来谈谈。第一，我们参观了炼铁厂。这个公社位于半山区和山区，产铁矿，公社贯彻了党的因地制宜，就地取材的方针，在去年大战钢铁的时候，发挥了冲天干劲，破除迷信，解放了思想，以共产主义敢想敢说敢干的精神，经过十九次的试验，炼铁成功，由一个小土炉，增加到八百个小土炉，共产铁一千六百九十六吨，为一○七○万吨钢贡献出一分力量。今天这些土炉已统通变为小洋炉群了，现在正在为今年的钢铁任务而努力。
    第二，参观了阿拉乡正在着手建设的一个新村。他们的计划是：一九五九年要重点建成这个新村，共八十七栋大楼房，并将十三个自然村的四千个农民合并迁入。并建立与此相适应的食堂七个、医院一个、中学小学各一个、电影院一所，并建设百货商店、邮电所、银行、大队办公室、沐浴室，招待所等。现在已经建成两栋西式楼房，都是砖木结构，房屋的图样是征求当地撒尼族农民的意见建盖的，完全适合于一家老小的团聚，这种在农村里的规模宏大的新村，我还是第一次看见，这是今后新农村的方向，类似这种建设将是接踵而至的。而那里的农民过去是甚么景况呢？那就是备受封建地主的残酷剥削和压迫，加之兵匪的蹂躏，生活万分艰苦，终年在饥饿线上挣扎。在中国共产党的领导下，曾几何时，农民们不仅解决了祖祖辈辈为之日夜焦虑的吃饭穿衣问题，而且竟享受着这种幸福生活了。
    在我参观中，看见每个社员都充满着欢乐和希望的心情，以实干、苦干、巧干的精神进行着劳动，从他们唱的歌里表达了他们的心情和改变大自然的伟大气魄：
    一、春天到来百花香，一边锄麦一边唱，想起丰收忘了累，干劲愈大心愈甜。
    二、锄的锄来挑的挑，人人生产热情高，移风易俗搞生产，千辛万苦不辞劳。
    三、日新月异大不同，苦干巧干立大功，乡村变成城市样，城市乡村两相通。
    四、不断革命争上游，铁树开花水倒流，小春坚决要革命，高产捷报传全球。
    从我看到的情况，给了我一次深刻的社会主义教育，说明了人民公社的无比优越性，它已使幼有所长、壮有所用、老有所养，鳏寡孤独废疾者各得其所，这是前人和任何资本主义国家所作不到的。由此深深体会到中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导是我们各族人民幸福的泉源，拿今天劳动人民的生活与反动统治时代来比，真是天上地下之别，不能相比，并由此深深认识到劳动人民为何在大跃进中在公社化后，会以这么大的干劲，在生产战线上欢欣鼓舞地坚持战斗，与社会主义事业建立血肉不可分离的感情。这就是因为我们今天的劳动，不仅为了自己，也是为了自己和子孙万代的幸福，没有任何人来从中剥削、压迫、奴役，劳动人民自己作了主人，因而干劲冲天。那种把人当奴隶去劳动的正是帝国主义国家，这种罪恶行为在我们中国永远不会有了。在这里，我寄语在国外的亲友，不要误信别有用心者的诬蔑，他们是狗嘴里吐不出象牙的。
    帝国主义者对我们的人民公社化运动惊慌失措，引起了他们的愤恨和仇视，是因为人民公社化运动表明中国人已经掌握了自己的命运，六亿五千万人民在全国范围内更好地组织起来了，国家建设事业将因此更快更好地发展，因此我国将更加强大，这个事实必将增强全世界人民对于社会主义优越性的信念，帝国主义者当然害怕这样的事情的。
    杜勒斯曾经力竭声嘶地攻击人民公社，说甚么“公社化计划是世界历史上没有前例的规模上牺牲人类尊严的奴隶劳动计划”，“个性和人格受到野蛮的压制”，“家庭生活被摧毁”等等，但是事实俱在，明眼人自知，杜勒斯的谰言是不值一驳的。至于诬蔑我们破坏家庭制度，我们破坏的是封建的家庭制度，建立的是民主和睦的幸福家庭，只有消灭剥削人的资本主义制度之后，这样的家庭才有可能普遍出现。公社举办托儿所、幼儿园、集体食堂便于妇女参加社会生产，彻底把妇女从锅灶边、孩子堆里解放了出来，因此，我们各族妇女无不额手称庆，愿为社会主义事业竭尽一切力量。
    我们的好事情，正是我们敌人最痛恨的事情，这是很明白的。我们的事业是正义的事情，正义的事业一定要蓬勃发展的，而那些企图扭转历史车轮的人，已经一个一个地倒下去了，还将要一个一个继续倒下去的。
    我们视察的先锋和阿拉两个人民公社，在发展的过程中，当然也有过一些缺点。问题在于人民公社是一个新生的事物，领导和群众的经验都还不足，在它的初期，工作中不可避免地会有一些暂时的困难或个别的缺点，这是不足为怪的。而经过最近几个月来的整顿之后，贯彻执行了统一领导，分级管理，分级核算，按劳分配的原则，人民公社是已经更加巩固了。正如阿拉乡的农民所唱的：“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁”，这两个公社和全国所有的公社一样，正在向着自己伟大的目标迈进。
    我国十年来的成就，无可置疑地证明了，中国共产党领导的正确，党的路线方针和政策完全符合中国革命和建设的实际，完全符合六亿五千万人民的利益。我一定要遵照周恩来总理在报告中给工商业者的指示，要在积极参加社会主义建设工作中认真地继续进行自我教育和自我改造，为社会主义事业贡献我毕生力量。
