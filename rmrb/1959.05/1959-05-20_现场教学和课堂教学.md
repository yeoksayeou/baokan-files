On-site Teaching and Classroom Teaching
Zhou Nan
In the process of the educational revolution, on-site teaching methods have been developed by implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. This kind of on-site teaching is lively and is a new type of teaching method that links theory with practice, supplementing the deficiencies of classroom teaching. Some students said: "Some courses are only lectures, just like pouring sesame oil into water, floating lightly on the surface, unable to penetrate." Through on-site production teaching, there are living teaching materials, which enable students to learn deeper, more thoroughly, and more practically from hearing to seeing, from seeing to doing, and from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. Teachers can also gradually cultivate a dialectical materialist viewpoint and a realistic and scientific attitude of analysis in on-site teaching, realizing that the only standard for testing theory is practice.

On-site teaching is different from general classroom teaching. It is necessary to closely integrate production practice with the teaching process; it is also different from general production. There must be teaching activities that are adapted to productive labor. Therefore, teachers must fully grasp these characteristics in on-site teaching. On-site teaching must not only impart production technology knowledge, but also theoretically improve practical experience.

An important method of on-site teaching is learning by doing. Through their own production practice, teachers and students can not only easily accept production knowledge and leave a deep impression, but also easily discover problems, be targeted, and improve teaching quality. Therefore, on-site teaching should not be just a visit, but should be hands-on; it should not be just a fleeting glance, but should be about getting off the horse to plant flowers. Teachers and students should also combine with production experts to give play to their role in participating in production practice.

On-site teaching in colleges and universities is an important form of combining teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. On-site teaching, on the one hand, can quickly reflect production achievements in teaching work, enrich teaching content, and improve teaching quality; on the other hand, it can elevate production laws to theory and serve production, which makes it possible to combine on-site teaching with scientific research work. Some people believe that scientific research can only be carried out in the laboratory and dare not cross the line. This is a one-sided view. The laboratory is certainly an important place for scientific research, but its connection with production practice is not so direct and close, and it cannot replace on-site scientific research. In fact, in on-site teaching, once theory is combined with production practice, it will inevitably spark scientific research. If we mobilize everyone's wisdom and delve into it, we will surely turn the spark into a torch and shine brightly. Of course, the scientific research work of the school should be purposeful and planned, and we should not study whatever we encounter. On-site scientific research is only one of the methods, and it should also be carried out in conjunction with other methods. Although on-site teaching is a new method of teaching, it also has certain limitations. The production process of an industrial product cannot summarize the production process of various products; the growth process of a crop cannot summarize the growth process of all crops. Each production practice process has its own development laws and systematicness. It is difficult and impossible to replace the overall development laws and systematicness with a certain production process. At the same time, the production cycle is also inconsistent with the teaching cycle. Some people say that the production process can be used as a new systematic theoretical teaching to replace the systematic theoretical teaching in the classroom. This is difficult and impossible.

In order to carry out systematic theoretical teaching, we must take care of the characteristics of the course, adopt classroom teaching and other effective teaching methods, so that on-site teaching can be better combined with classroom teaching and truly become an auxiliary method of classroom teaching. Classroom teaching adopts a class-based teaching system, which teaches more students and can carry out teaching purposefully, plannedly, and systematically, and the effect will be faster. Therefore, classroom teaching should become the main teaching form. Only in this way can the school enable students to acquire a certain systematic scientific knowledge and master the skills to use these scientific knowledge within a certain number of years. Classroom teaching and on-site teaching are two different teaching methods. They should be uniformly arranged and flexibly applied according to different situations, different requirements, different teaching content, and different conditions, so that they can complement and develop each other. If we can pay attention to both production practice and book knowledge, and be good at using various teaching methods, then the quality of teaching can be continuously improved, and the Party's education policy can be adhered to and implemented.

    现场教学和课堂教学
    周南
    在教育革命过程中，贯彻执行党的教育与生产劳动相结合方针下，发展了现场教学的方法。这种现场教学是生动活泼的，是理论联系实际的一种新型的教学方法，补充了课堂教学的不足。有的学生说：“有的课程只听讲，就好像把香油倒在水里，轻飘飘地浮在上面，渗透不进去。”通过生产的现场教学，有了活的教材，使学生从听到看，从看到做，从感性认识到理性认识，就可以学得更深，更透，更踏实。教师在现场教学中，也可以逐步培养辩证唯物主义的观点和实事求是的科学分析的态度，认识到检验理论的唯一标准，就是实践。
    现场教学和一般课堂教学不同，要把生产实践同教学过程紧密结合；它又和一般生产不同，要有同生产劳动相适应的教学活动。因此，教师在现场教学中，就要充分掌握这些特点。现场教学既要传授生产技术知识，又要对实践经验作理论的提高。
    现场教学的重要办法是边做边学。教师和学生通过自身的生产实践，不仅容易接受生产知识，印象深刻，而且也容易发现问题，有的放矢，提高教学质量。所以，现场教学不能只是参观，而要动手，不能只是走马看花，而要下马种花，在教师学生参加生产实践中，还要同生产能手相结合，发挥他们的作用。
    高等学校的现场教学，是教学、生产劳动和科学研究相结合的一个重要形式。现场教学，一方面能够使生产成就很快地反映到教学工作中间来，充实教学内容，提高教学质量；另一方面又能够使生产规律上升为理论，为生产服务，这就使现场教学同科学研究工作有可能结合起来。有人认为，只有在实验室中才能进行科学研究，不敢越雷池一步。那是片面的看法。实验室固然是进行科学研究的重要场所，但是，它同生产实际的联系不是那么直接和密切，它不可能代替现场的科学研究。事实上，在现场教学中，理论一经同生产实际相结合，便必然会爆发出科学研究的火花。如果我们动员大家的智慧，深入钻研，必将使火花变成火炬，大放光芒。当然，学校的科学研究工作应当是有目的、有计划的，不能碰到什么就研究什么，现场的科学研究只是方法之一，还应当同其它的方法配合进行。现场教学，虽然是教学上的新方法，但它也有一定的局限性。一件工业产品的生产过程，不可能概括各种产品的生产过程；一种农作物的生长过程，也不可能概括全部作物的生长过程。每个生产实践的过程都有它的发展规律和系统性，要把某一个生产过程来代替全体的发展规律和系统性是有困难的，也是不可能的。同时，生产的周期同教学的周期也是不一致的。有人说，可以把生产过程作为新的系统理论教学，来代替课堂的系统理论教学。这是有困难的，而且是不可能的。
    为了进行系统的理论教学，就须照顾课程特点，采取课堂教学以及其它有效的教学方法，使现场教学更好地结合课堂教学，真正成为课堂教学的辅助方法。课堂教学采取班级授课制，教的学生比较多，能够有目的、有计划、有系统地进行教学，收到的效果将比较快，所以课堂教学就应当成为主要的教学形式。只有这样，学校才能在一定的年限内，使学生获得一定的系统的科学知识，以及掌握运用这些科学知识的技能。课堂教学和现场教学，是两种不同的教学方法，应该根据不同情况，不同要求，不同教学
  内容，不同条件，作统一安排，灵活运用，才能相互补充，相互发展。如果能够既重视生产实践，又重视书本知识，善于运用各种教学方法，那末，教学的质量也就可以不断提高，党的教育方针也就可以得到坚持贯彻。
