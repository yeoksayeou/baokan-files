    (Our Newspaper's Report) In the battle to strive for even greater victories in the second half of May, the Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Steelmaking Plant mobilized everyone to overcome the most critical bottleneck in current steel production – furnace maintenance. This has led to a daily increase in effective operating rates, averaging 268 tons of steel more than the state plan each day.
    The plant first educated all employees on the importance of maintaining furnaces for increasing charging capacity and accelerating the refining process, by establishing exemplary role models. In the first half of May, the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant saw many advanced examples where good furnace maintenance promoted increased charging and faster refining. Prior to this, Open Hearth Furnace No. 16 had problems with its water jacket and furnace head, with each heat of steel taking as long as thirteen hours to melt. After employees tackled the problem, the time was immediately reduced to below nine hours, with three consecutive heats melting in around eight hours. Open Hearth Furnace No. 13, which had long been limited to a charging capacity of 280 tons, saw a surge to 330 tons after employees maintained the furnace hearth shape in excellent condition. Plant leaders seized on these examples, organizing the furnace chiefs from these open hearth furnaces to share their experiences. At the same time, they briefed the masses on the actual impact on production caused by poor furnace maintenance in the first half of the month, and launched mass discussions and debates. These activities made employees realize the importance of furnace maintenance. Therefore, employees in each furnace generally emphasized furnace protection work, and at the start of the second half of the month, made an all-out effort to overcome the furnace maintenance bottleneck. The open hearth furnace section identified key aspects of furnace protection work, such as water jackets, furnace heads, and furnace hearth shapes. All section chiefs and Party branch secretaries personally went deep into each open hearth furnace to prepare tools and materials for furnace protection work, and joined the masses in fighting to improve furnace maintenance.
    After the masses were fully mobilized, and a situation of everyone participating in furnace protection at all times was established, plant leaders consciously guided the masses' enthusiasm and energy towards meticulous and skillful work. They launched a technical revolution and technical innovation movement centered on maintaining furnaces, relying on the wisdom of the masses to solve many long-standing key problems. The blockage of the spray nozzles on each open hearth furnace with residue, hindering the smooth flow of flames and extending melting times, had been the most difficult part of furnace maintenance across the plant. After the surge of mass furnace protection, Zhu Fajun, the leader of the Class C technical research group, and worker Bing Zhixian, based on various rationalization proposals made by everyone, repeatedly experimented and finally successfully created a pendulum-style automatic spray nozzle cleaning device. Using the force of a small iron rail suspended on a steel rope, its swing impacted the residue, increasing efficiency fourfold and freeing workers from heavy manual labor.
    Since furnace maintenance is a task that must be consistently adhered to, the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant, while carrying out the mass furnace protection movement, promptly consolidated and formulated a complete set of furnace maintenance regulations to ensure that furnace protection work is regularized. According to regulations, each part of each open hearth furnace is assigned to a specific person who is responsible for regular maintenance. Each shift has an inspection team composed of the Party branch secretary, section chief, smelting technician, and technical personnel to inspect each furnace and each shift, establishing a daily report on furnace maintenance inspection. Problems found are immediately addressed by dedicated personnel. The open hearth furnace section conducts a major inspection and evaluation once a week, and the results are announced to all employees. In addition, a team composed of leading Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres across the plant conducts regular plant-wide furnace inspections.
    Since the launch of the movement, the furnace conditions at the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant have significantly improved. From the 16th to the 20th, the plant's effective operating rate increased by 1.56% compared to the first half of May, and the average melting time for each heat of steel was reduced by ten minutes.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th) The Shenyang Water Pump Factory has continuously strengthened equipment maintenance and overhaul work, and has completely eliminated major mechanical accidents. Ordinary mechanical accidents are also gradually decreasing. At the same time, because the equipment is well maintained, machine tools have maintained normal precision and achieved greater efficiency. Product quality and output have also rapidly increased, effectively guaranteeing the great leap forward in production.
    Since last year, the Shenyang Water Pump Factory has consistently emphasized equipment maintenance and scheduled equipment overhauls. In the past, the factory's major, medium, and minor equipment repairs, as well as inspection and cleaning, were planned by the Power Equipment Section. Last year, the factory revised the equipment maintenance system: major and medium repair plans are jointly formulated by the Equipment Section and each workshop, and the Equipment Section is responsible for their implementation. Minor repairs and inspection cleaning tasks are handled by the workshop maintenance teams. This ensures that each workshop can promptly clean and inspect the equipment. Regarding the reserve of machine tool spare parts, the factory has dedicated personnel responsible. Each machine tool has a certain number of spare parts stored to allow for immediate replacement after an accident, without affecting production. Because equipment maintenance work has been done well, the factory was rated as an excellent equipment maintenance unit in the Northeast region by the First Ministry of Machine Building last year.
    The Shenyang Water Pump Factory's good equipment maintenance and repair work is mainly due to the importance attached to it by the leadership. During the great leap forward in production, the factory clearly stipulated that the primary task of the machine repair workshop and each workshop's maintenance team is to ensure the normal operation of equipment. Under heavy production tasks, the machine repair workshop and each workshop's maintenance team also undertake production tasks, but these cannot affect repair work. When production and repair conflict, they first prioritize repair work. The factory also arranges repair tasks each time work is assigned. Equipment maintenance and the avoidance of accidents are also included as a criterion for evaluation when carrying out various movements and competitions. In April this year, the factory spent four days specifically carrying out a safety equipment maintenance movement, further establishing and improving the necessary equipment maintenance system. Another major inspection was conducted in May.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th The Harbin Bearing Factory has mobilized the masses to establish and improve equipment management responsibility systems and operating maintenance procedures. It has strengthened the technical management of equipment repair and maintenance, greatly improved equipment utilization, rapidly reduced equipment accidents, and powerfully ensured a leap forward in production.
    Doing a good job in equipment maintenance so that equipment operates safely and the functions of each machine are fully utilized is an important factor in guaranteeing high-quality, high-yield enterprises. However, many people in this factory previously lacked sufficient understanding of this point. Some people only focused on production, neglecting equipment maintenance. Equipment accidents frequently occurred in some workshops, affecting production. Recently, the factory carried out bottom-up, large-scale airing of views, debates, and mass mobilization to find problems, investigate causes, and propose solutions surrounding equipment accidents. Over the course of a week, factory workers put forward more than 4,000 suggestions and technical measures to strengthen equipment maintenance, and criticized the one-sided view that put repairing equipment in opposition to completing production tasks. On this basis, the factory established and improved a series of equipment maintenance and repair systems, and reorganized the organizational structure of the Mechanical Power Section and the workshop machine repair teams. The machine repair teams in each workshop adopted a combination of professional teams and mass participation, absorbing more workers to participate in equipment repair work, greatly increasing the workers' sense of responsibility. The Fourth Workshop established equipment maintenance, repair, and other systems. Workers carefully scrubbed machine tools, regularly oiled them, repaired minor problems themselves, and immediately called the machine repair team for major problems. Because everyone was involved in equipment repair, the entire workshop did not have a single accident in April.
    In order to prevent problems from arising, the factory also strengthened the reserve of machine parts and pre-repair work. To date, 90% of the factory's machines have undergone pre-repair, ensuring that minor problems are treated in a timely manner.
    Eighty percent of the factory's production workers are new apprentices, and they lack experience in machine tool operation and maintenance. Based on this situation, the factory adopted a method of first training professional personnel, and then having these professional personnel go to each workshop to widely impart technology. A basic technical training in equipment operation and maintenance was organized throughout the factory, improving the operating skills of workers, especially apprentices.

    鞍钢第二炼钢厂群策群力做好维护工作
    炉体健壮　钢水多流
    沈阳水泵厂长期坚持按期检修设备彻底消灭重大事故
    哈尔滨轴承厂90％的机器进行预修有了毛病及早医治
    本报讯　鞍钢第二炼钢厂在力争5月下半月更大胜利的战斗里，上下一齐动手，全力突破当前炼钢生产上最主要的关键——维护炉体关，使有效作业率逐日增高，平均每天比国家计划多生产二百六十八吨钢。
    这个厂首先通过树立典型的方法，教育全体职工树立起维护好炉体才能多装快炼的观点。5月上半月，第二炼钢厂出现了许多由于维护好炉体而推动了多装、快炼的先进典型。十六号平炉以前水套、炉头不正常，每炉钢熔炼时间长达十三小时，经过职工突击处理后，立即缩短到九小时以下，并且连出三炉熔炼时间在八小时左右的快速炼钢。长期以来装入量只能达到二百八十吨的十三号平炉，由于职工把炉膛形状维护得十分正常，装入量已经猛增到三百三十吨。厂领导抓住典型，组织这些平炉的炉长现身说法，同时把上半月由于炉体维护不好而影响了生产的实际情况向群众作了介绍，发动群众鸣放辩论。这些活动使职工认识到维护炉体的重要性。因此，各炉职工普遍重视了护炉工作，下半月一开始，就全力攻取维护炉体关。平炉工段确定了水套、炉头、炉膛形状等护炉工作中的关键。各班总工长、党支部书记都亲自深入到各座平炉，为护炉工作准备好工具、材料，并且和群众一起突破维护炉体的战斗。
    当群众充分发动起来，人人动手、时时护炉的局面形成以后，厂领导有意识地把群众的热情和干劲引向细干、巧干方面，开展以维护好炉体为中心的技术革命和技术革新运动，依靠群众智慧，解决了许多长期以来不能解决的关键问题。各座平炉喷出口被残渣堵死，火焰不能畅通，延长熔炼时间，曾经是全厂炉体维护上最困难的一个环节。群众性护炉热潮掀起以后，丙班技术研究组组长朱法钧和工人炳知先等，根据大家提出的各种合理化建议，反复试验，终于创造成功了钟摆式自动打喷出口设备，利用一段悬在钢绳上的小铁轨摆动时的力量冲击残渣，效率比原来提高四倍，把工人们从繁重的体力劳动中解放了出来。
    由于维护炉体是一项必须经常坚持才能作好的工作，第二炼钢厂在群众性护炉运动开展的同时，及时地整顿和制订了一整套维护炉体制度，使护炉工作经常化。按照规定，每座平炉炉体各部都有专人负责，定期处理；每班由党支部书记、总工长、冶炼技师、技术人员等组成检查组，逐炉、逐班检查，建立炉体维护检查情况日报表，发现问题立即组织专人负责解决。平炉工段每周大检查、大评比一次，向全体职工公布结果。此外，还由全厂党政工团负责干部组成检查组，定期进行全厂性的炉体大检查。
    运动开展以来，第二炼钢厂炉体情况已经有显著好转。16日至20日全厂有效作业率比5月上半月提高了1.56％，熔炼时间平均每炉钢缩短了十分钟。
    据新华社沈阳28日电　沈阳水泵厂不断加强设备维护检修工作，已经彻底消灭了重大机械事故；一般的机械事故也在逐步下降。同时，因为设备维护得好，机床保持了正常的精度和发挥了更大的效能，产品质量和产量也迅速提高，有效地保证了生产大跃进。
    沈阳水泵厂从去年以来，一直重视保养设备，按时检修设备。过去，这个厂大修、中修、小修设备和检查清洗设备，都是由动力设备科来编排计划。去年，工厂里修订了设备维修制度：大修、中修计划由设备科和各车间共同制定，并由设备科负责执行；小修和检查清洗任务由车间的维护组担负。这样就保证了各车间对设备及时进行清洗检查。在机床备件的储备方面，这个厂设有专人负责。每台机床都储有一定数量的备件，以便发生事故后随时更换，不影响生产。由于设备保养工作做得好，这个厂去年曾被第一机械工业部评为东北区设备保养优秀单位。
    沈阳水泵厂设备维护检修工作搞得好，主要的原因是领导重视。在生产大跃进中，厂里曾明确规定：机修车间和各车间的维护组，首要任务是保证设备正常运转。在生产任务繁重的情况下，机修车间和各车间维护组虽然也担负生产任务，但不能影响检修工作；当生产和检修发生冲突时，他们就首先做好检修工作。厂里每次布置工作时，都同时布置检修任务。开展各项运动和各种竞赛时，也都把设备保养、不发生事故，作为评比的一项内容。今年4月份，这个厂曾经用四天的时间专门开展了一次安全设备保养运动，进一步建立和健全了必要的设备保养制度。5月里又进行了一次大检查。
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　哈尔滨轴承厂发动群众建立健全设备管理责任制度和操作维护规程，加强设备检修、保养的技术管理工作，大大提高了设备利用率，使设备事故迅速减少，有力地保证了生产跃进。
    做好设备维修，使其安全运转，充分发挥每台机器的作用，是保证企业优质高产的一个重要因素。但是，这个厂的许多人过去对这一点认识不足，有些人只顾生产，忽视保养设备，有的车间经常发生设备事故，影响生产。最近，这个工厂开展了自下而上的大鸣大放大辩论，发动群众围绕着设备事故找问题、查原因、提措施。经过一周时间，全厂职工共提出四千多条加强维护设备的建议和技术措施；批判了把维修设备同完成生产任务对立起来的片面看法。在这一基础上，工厂建立和健全了一系列的设备保养检修制度，重新整顿了机械动力科与车间机修组的组织机构。各车间机修组都采取了专业队伍与群众相结合的办法，吸收了更多的职工参加设备维修工作，大大提高了职工们的责任感。四车间建立了设备保养、检修等制度，职工们精心地擦洗机床，按时注油，小毛病自己动手修，出现较大的问题立即请机修组抢修。由于人人动手搞设备维修，全车间在4月份内没有出一件事故。
    为了作到以预防为主，这个厂还加强了机器部件的储备和预检修工作。到目前为止，全厂已有90％的机器进行了预修，使小毛病一露头就得到及时医治。
    这个厂的生产工人80％是新徒工，他们在机床操作和维护上都没有经验。根据这一情况，工厂采取了先训练专业人员，然后由这些专业人员到各车间普遍传授技术的办法，在全厂组织了一次设备操作和维护的基本技术训练，提高了工人特别是徒工的操作水平。
