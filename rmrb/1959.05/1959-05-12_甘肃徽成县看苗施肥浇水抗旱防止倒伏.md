    Lanzhou, May 11 (People's Daily) — Huicheng County, Gansu Province, recently conducted a survey on the growth of winter wheat. The survey results showed that, thanks to the careful management from last winter to this spring, winter wheat is growing vigorously, with thick stalks and tender leaves, and has begun to head. The growth situation is better than in any previous year. However, the survey also revealed some problems. For example, although the winter wheat in the plain areas is growing very well, the planting density is too high and the fertilizer is insufficient, resulting in a serious tendency to lodge. In the mountainous areas and winter wheat fields far from villages, there are still many weeds, and diseases and insect pests such as rust and red spiders have been discovered, requiring urgent strengthening of late-stage management.
    Based on the survey, the Huicheng County Party Committee proposed measures to strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields:
    1. Apply fertilizer appropriately and adequately at the right time. During the current booting stage, all winter wheat should be topdressed universally. Third-class fields should be topdressed with more nitrogen fertilizer, while first- and second-class fields should be topdressed with more potassium and phosphorus fertilizer. Only by increasing topdressing and universally topdressing at this time can we achieve more and fuller grains and increase yield.
    2. Some winter wheat fields still lack moisture, which is not conducive to the needs of the later stage of wheat growth. Efforts should be made to mobilize the masses to overcome drought in every possible way, so that winter wheat can be fully nourished.
    3. Due to the widespread dense planting of winter wheat this year, the density is high, and the seedlings are relatively crowded, with a tendency to lodge. Lodging has already been observed in first-class fields. Effective measures should be taken to prevent lodging and avoid yield reduction caused by lodging.
    4. Vigorously strengthen the work of preventing frost, insects, and diseases.
    Currently, a mass upsurge in late-stage management of wheat fields has been launched throughout the county, and pests and diseases have been basically controlled. The original 6% of third-class wheat fields in the county have also been basically eliminated.

    甘肃徽成县看苗施肥浇水抗旱防止倒伏
    本报兰州11日电　甘肃省徽成县最近对冬小麦生长情况进行了调查。调查结果发现：经过去冬今春的精细管理，冬小麦生长健旺，秆粗叶嫩，已开始吐穗，生长情况比以往任何一年都好。但在调查中，也发现了一些问题，如川区的冬小麦虽然生长很好，但密植程度过大，肥分不足，有严重的倒伏趋势；山区的冬小麦和离村庄较远的冬小麦杂草还多，已发现有锈病和红蜘蛛等虫害，急需加强后期管理。
    徽成县委根据调查情况，提出加强麦田后期管理的措施：
    一、适时适量分别施肥。当前孕穗期全部冬小麦要普遍施一次追肥，三类田多施氮肥，一、二类田多施钾磷肥。只有在此时期增施追肥，普遍追肥，才能做到粒多粒饱，增加产量。
    二、有些冬小麦麦田还有缺墒现象，和麦田后期的需要也不适应，应动员群众千方百计战胜干旱，让冬小麦吃饱喝足。
    三、由于今年冬小麦普遍密植，密度大，苗株比较挤，有倒伏趋势，现在一级田已发现有倒伏现象。应采取有效措施防止倒伏，避免因倒伏而造成减产。
    四、大力加强防霜、防虫和防病工作。
    目前，全县掀起一个群众性的麦田后期管理高潮，已基本上控制了病虫害。原来全县三类麦田有6％，现在也基本消灭。
