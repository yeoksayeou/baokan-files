Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th. The No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, two competing rivals, have advanced side by side in the first five days of Red May, with their average utilization coefficients both leaping to 2.135.

　　In April, the average utilization coefficient of the No. 9 blast furnace was 2.051. The average utilization coefficient of the No. 3 blast furnace also jumped from 1.745 in March to 1.995, closely following behind the No. 9 blast furnace. Entering Red May, the workers on the No. 9 blast furnace are determined to hold the high-yield red flag even higher, not only to lead in Anshan Iron and Steel but also to win the championship in the utilization coefficient of large blast furnaces nationwide. The workers of the No. 3 blast furnace also have full confidence in surpassing the No. 9 blast furnace. On the first day of Red May, the No. 9 blast furnace continued to run ahead of the No. 3 blast furnace, but on the second day, the No. 3 blast furnace overtook the No. 9 blast furnace. The two blast furnaces chased each other and promoted each other. The workers of the No. 9 blast furnace skillfully applied the experience of increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio. From May 1st to 5th, they steadily increased the blast furnace utilization coefficient to 2.135, averaging 45 tons of pig iron more than the state plan every day. The workers of the No. 3 blast furnace improved the charging system as early as April 30th, allowing the blast furnace to accept more wind. From the 1st to the 5th, they overfulfilled the production plan every day, producing 116 tons more pig iron than in April every day, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient also reached 2.135.

　　Currently, the competition between the two blast furnaces is in full swing. The workers of the No. 3 blast furnace summarized the results of the first five days and convened a general meeting of Party members and Youth League members of the entire furnace, determined to surpass the No. 9 blast furnace in the next round. The employees of the No. 9 blast furnace are also defending the red flag.

　　鞍钢九号、三号高炉双双跃进
    跨进红五月平均利用系数提高到2.135
    据新华社鞍山7日电　鞍山钢铁公司九号高炉和三号高炉两个竞赛对手，在红五月头五天内并驾齐驱，平均利用系数双双跃进到了二点一三五。
    4月份，九号高炉的平均利用系数是二点○五一。三号高炉的平均利用系数也从3月份的一点七四五跳到一点九九五，紧紧地跟在九号高炉的后面。进入红五月，九号高炉上的工人们，决心把高产红旗举得更高，不仅要在鞍钢领先，而且要夺取全国大型高炉利用系数的冠军。三号高炉的工人们也信心百倍地要超过九号高炉。红五月的头一天，九号高炉继续跑在三号高炉前面，但是第二天，三号高炉就赶过了九号高炉，两座高炉你追我赶，互相促进。九号高炉的工人熟练地运用提高冶炼强度、降低焦比的经验，从5月1日到5日，稳步地把高炉利用系数提高到二点一三五，平均每天比国家计划增产四十五吨生铁。三号高炉工人早在4月30日就改进了装料制度，让高炉能够接受更多的风，从1日到5日天天超额完成生产计划，比4月份每天多产生铁一百一十六吨，高炉利用系数也达到二点一三五。
    目前，两座高炉竞赛正酣。三号高炉工人总结了头五天的战果，召开了全炉党团员大会，决心在下一个回合超过九号高炉。九号高炉职工也正在保卫红旗。
