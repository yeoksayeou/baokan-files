Labor Training, Investigation and Research, Studying Theory
Renmin University Students "Read Books Actively"
(Our report) A learning style of combining theory with practice is increasingly growing among teachers and students of Renmin University of China.
Students in many classes across the university have summarized their learning experiences and insights since implementing the Party's educational policy last year. Everyone believes that the common and prominent change in learning is the emphasis on the connection between theory and practice. Last year, between August and September, thousands of teachers and students went to factories and the countryside. While participating in productive labor and practical work, they also engaged in new practices of social investigation, scientific research, and theoretical study, greatly changing the atmosphere of "reading books rigidly and being bookish" in the past.
The students' deepest feeling is that, after the training of productive labor and practical work, they not only increased their affection for the working people, but also established a mass viewpoint of looking downwards in their studies. For example, when the third-year students of Class 7 in the Philosophy Department were compiling the "Atheism" lecture notes for farmers, specifically the section on "the harm of superstition," the students visited elderly farmers throughout the village and collected many vivid materials. The compiled teaching materials were very popular among the farmers. Their experience is that, to popularize philosophy, it is not only necessary to read more books, but more importantly, to go deep into the masses, deep into reality, and conduct social investigations. Students in each class gradually experienced that as long as they earnestly learn from the masses and truly delve into reality, they can not only learn many ordinary knowledge, but also learn rich knowledge related to their major with ease.
In order to further learn from the masses, learn from reality, and in turn serve the masses and practical work, teachers and students across the university have widely carried out social investigations and scientific research. Law students in the Changping District People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing adopted methods such as writing about what they learned and writing about what they did. In three months, they wrote more than 600 investigation reports and papers. These reports and papers all came from the work experience and problems of the masses and cadres, and many were completed with the assistance of cadres and the masses. In order to solve some of the problems raised by the masses and the problems existing in practical work, the students naturally set off a wave of scientific research. The third-year students of Class 3 in the Economics Department, in the Si Ji Qing People's Commune, everyone used their brains, put pen to paper, discussed collectively, and repeatedly researched, writing more than 40 articles on the experience of leading production in the current people's communes and their learning experiences. Among them, "Popular Talks on People's Commune Problems" and "How to Run a Production Team Well" played a certain role in promoting the actual work of the commune. In carrying out scientific research, the students gradually felt that their theoretical knowledge was insufficient, so they eagerly began to study theory. In this way, social investigation and scientific research starting from reality have also become important means of connecting theory with practice and promoting theoretical learning.
During the period of going to the countryside, after students studied the two courses "Communist Education" and "People's Commune" in connection with reality, everyone said that they learned deeply, thoroughly, remembered quickly, and did not forget easily. When the third-year students of Class 5 in the Department of Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism were studying the unit "The People's Commune is the Inevitable Trend of Social Development," they combined it with mobilizing students to investigate social conditions. In a lively learning discussion, everyone raised and solved hundreds of problems. Some students said with solid evidence: From the situation of each household, I can prove the truth that the people's commune is the inevitable trend of social development. Everyone took out many living people and living events to illustrate the different attitudes of people from different classes towards the people's commune. In this way, they became more convinced and deeply understood the Party's policies. Through this method of learning in connection with reality, the students' interest in learning has been universally improved. During the learning process, in addition to each student writing an investigation material, they also jointly completed seven special investigation reports, three comprehensive reports, and thirteen scientific papers. The learning process became a process of connecting with reality and improving understanding.
This semester, under the leadership of the Party Committee, teachers and students combined research and applied the experience of connecting theory with practice during their time in factories and the countryside to every teaching link, making certain arrangements for students' learning, production, and scientific research. In classroom teaching, the teaching content has greatly enriched materials that connect with social reality, and the teaching methods also pay attention to connecting with the students' ideological situation.
Departments such as the Department of Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Philosophy, and Economics have adopted the method of combining teachers and students in teaching, with teachers as the leading force, mobilizing students to change the previous method of reading books rigidly. In addition to earnest lecturing and reading, students connect with the practical work they have understood and their personal ideological understanding, and carry out free discussion, debate, and writing of learning experiences, so that they can not only learn more systematic theoretical knowledge, but also improve students' ideological understanding. In order to maintain a close connection between learning and the reality of workers, peasants and soldiers, the Philosophy Department spends about one day a week going to the countryside to teach farmers philosophy, participate in labor, and conduct social investigations. Teachers and students of the Department of Trade and Economics, since starting the internship store last September, are still participating in store labor and teaching at the same time, and the students are learning vividly and actively. In order to improve the quality of teaching, many classes are conducting scientific activities in a planned way. The Philosophy Department has adopted a method of combining large, medium, and small research projects, connecting with the actual social situation, and plans to write a "Collection of Dialectical Essays on the Great Leap Forward." Consolidating the existing experience of connecting theory with practice from all aspects, both preventing any phenomenon of neglecting theoretical learning and promoting the style of reading books actively. Everyone firmly believes that in a school mainly based on philosophy and social sciences, making learning rooted in the deep soil of the motherland's socialist revolution and construction, the theory of Marxism-Leninism will become increasingly deeply rooted and lush, and a new generation of Marxist-Leninist theoretical talents will surely grow up rapidly and healthily.

    劳动锻炼　调查研究　钻研理论
    人民大学学生“活读书”
    本报讯　中国人民大学师生中，理论联系实际的学习风气日益成长。
    全校许多班级的学生总结了去年执行党的教育方针以来的学习心得和经验，大家认为在学习上共同的突出的变化是重视了理论与实际的联系。去年八、九月间，全校几千师生下厂下乡，在参加生产劳动和实际工作的同时，又进行了社会调查、科学研究和理论学习的新的实践，大大改变了过去“死读书、读死书”的空气。
    学生们感受最深的是，经过生产劳动和实际工作的锻炼不仅增长了对劳动人民的感情，也在学习上树立了眼睛向下的群众观点。如哲学系三年级七班学生在为农民编写
  “无神论”讲义中“迷信鬼神的危害性”一节时，学生们遍访全村老农，收集了许多生动的材料，编出的教材很受农民欢迎。他们的经验是，要普及哲学，不仅应该多读书，更重要的是深入群众，深入实际，进行社会调查。各班级学生逐步体验到只要认真地拜群众为师，切实深入实际，不仅可以学到许多普通的知识，并且可以左右逢源，学到与专业有关的丰富知识。
    为进一步向群众学习、向实际学习并反转来为群众、为实际工作服务，全校师生广泛开展了社会调查和科学研究工作。法律系学生在京郊昌平区人民公社，采取学什么写什么、作什么写什么等办法，三个月中写了六百多篇调查报告和论文。在这些报告和论文中，都是来自群众和干部的工作经验和问题，有不少是在干部、群众协助下完成的。学生们为了解决群众提出的一些问题和实际工作中存在的问题，很自然地掀起了科学研究的热潮。经济系三年级三班学生，在四季青人民公社，人人动脑、动笔，集体讨论，反复研究，写出了关于当前人民公社化领导生产的经验以及学习心得等四十多篇文章。其中
  “人民公社问题通俗讲话”、“怎样办好一个生产队”等，对公社的实际工作起了一定的推动作用。学生们在开展科学研究工作中逐渐感到理论知识十分不足，他们就如饥如渴的学习起理论来。这样，从实际出发的社会调查和科学研究，也成了联系实际推动理论学习的重要手段。
    在下乡期间，学生们联系实际学习了“共产主义教育”、“人民公社”两种课程以后，大家说学得深，学得透，记得快，不易忘。马列主义基础系三年级五班学生，在学习“人民公社是社会发展的必然趋势”单元时，结合发动学生调查社会情况，在生动活泼的学习讨论中，大家提出和解决了几百个问题。有的学生有根有据地说：从一家一户的情况，我都能证明人民公社是社会发展必然趋势的道理。大家拿出许多活人活事，说明不同阶层人民对人民公社的不同态度。这样，对党的政策更加坚信不移、领会深刻。通过这种联系实际的方法学习，普遍地提高了学生们的学习兴趣。学习过程中，学生们除每个人写一份调查材料外，还共同完成了七个专题调查报告、三个综合报告、十三篇科学论文。学习过程成为联系实际、提高认识的过程。
    这学期在党委领导下，师生结合研究把下乡下厂期间理论联系实际的经验，贯串到每个教学环节中去，对学生的学习、生产和科学研究作了一定的安排。在课堂教学中，教学内容大大丰富了联系社会实际的材料，教学方法上也注意了联系学生的思想情况。
    马列主义基础、哲学、经济等系在教学上都采取师生结合的办法，以教师为主导，发动学生改变以往读死书的办法，除认真讲授、读书以外，学生们联系已了解的实际工作及个人思想认识，开展鸣放、辩论、写学习心得，既要学到较系统的理论知识，又提高学生思想认识。哲学系为了保持学习与工农现实生活密切联系，每周有一天左右的时间到农村去教农民哲学并参加劳动，进行社会调查。贸易经济系师生，从去年九月办起实习商店以后，现仍一面参加商店劳动，一面教学，学生学习得生动活泼。为了提高教学质量，不少班级有计划地进行着科学活动。哲学系采取大中小研究项目相结合的办法，联系社会实际情况，计划写出一部“大跃进中的辩证法论文集”。从各方面巩固已有的理论联系实际的经验，既防止任何忽视理论学习的现象，又发扬了活读书的风气。大家坚信，在这样一个以哲学、社会科学为主的学校，使学习扎根在祖国社会主义革命和建设实际的深厚土壤中，马列主义的理论会日益根深叶茂，新一代的马列主义理论人材也一定会迅速健康地成长起来。
