    About the Geneva Accords
    Question: Under the instigation of the United States, the Lao government once declared the unilateral abandonment of the Geneva Accords, and now it is using armed forces to surround the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, plotting to provoke a civil war, and more thoroughly destroying the Geneva Accords on Laos. Please introduce the Geneva Accords.
    Tianjin, Hu Zhaohua

    Answer: The Geneva Accords were reached on July 21, 1954, at the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina, attended by representatives from the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, France, and the Indochinese countries.
    The Geneva Accords include the "Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference," the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam," the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos," and the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia" and other documents. The agreements stipulate specific methods for ending the Indochina War, prohibiting the introduction of all reinforcements, military personnel, and various weapons, ammunition, and military supplies into Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; that countries shall not participate in any military blocs and that no foreign country shall be allowed to establish military bases on their territory; and stipulate that the three countries of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia shall hold free general elections to achieve democracy and unification. Both sides of the ceasefire guarantee that no retaliation or discrimination will be taken against individuals or groups for their activities during the period of hostilities, and their democratic freedoms will be guaranteed. In order to smoothly implement the agreement, the conference decided to organize an International Supervisory and Control Commission composed of India, Canada, and Poland to supervise and monitor the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the Indochinese countries.
    The conclusion of the Geneva Accords ended the eight-year-long bloody war in Indochina and shattered the US conspiracy to expand the Indochina War. At that time, the United States refused to sign the agreement but was forced to issue a statement "guaranteeing" that it would not use threats or force to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords. However, shortly after the conclusion of the Geneva Accords, the United States formed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in September 1954, forcibly including Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam into the "protected area" of this group, openly violating the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Subsequently, the United States even more blatantly illegally dispatched military personnel and transported weapons and strategic materials to South Vietnam, obstructed the unification of Vietnam, and turned South Vietnam into a US military base. Then, the complete tearing up of the Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities in Laos became another conspiracy of the United States.
    With the assistance of the International Commission, the Royal Lao Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units reached two agreements in December 1956 and November 1957, respectively, determining that the two sides would establish a coalition government, that the Patriotic Party composed of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units and other patriots could carry out legal activities, and that the Pathet Lao Fighting Units would be incorporated into the Lao Royal Army without discrimination. However, under the instigation of the United States, the Royal Lao Government openly declared the unilateral abandonment of the Geneva Accords on February 11 this year, and recently openly dispatched a large number of armed forces to surround the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, plotting to disarm them, while sending military police to surround the residences of the leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, including Prince Souphanouvong, and other parliamentarians, arresting a large number of Patriotic Party members, and plotting to provoke a civil war to undermine peace in Indochina. The Royal Lao Government has completely torn up the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos, and has also completely torn up the two agreements reached with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units.

    关于日内瓦协议
    问：老挝政府在美国唆使下，曾声明片面废弃日内瓦协议，现在又武装包围前寮国战斗部队阴谋挑起内战，更彻底地破坏了关于老挝的日内瓦协议。请介绍一下日内瓦协议。
    天津　胡兆华
    答：日内瓦协议，是1954年7月21日在苏、中、美、英、法以及印度支那国家代表所参加的关于恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议上达成的。
    日内瓦协议包括“日内瓦会议最后宣言”、“关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定”、“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定”和“关于在柬埔寨停止敌对行动的协定”等文件。协议规定了关于停止印度支那战争的具体办法，禁止向越南、老挝、柬埔寨运进一切增援部队、军事人员以及各种武器、弹药和军用物资；各国不得参加任何军事集团和不准任何外国在它们领土上建立军事基地；规定越南、老挝、柬埔寨三个国家都要举行自由普选，以实现各国的民主和统一。各停战双方保证对于个人和团体不因其在敌对行为期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由。为了顺利实现协议，大会决定组织了由印度、加拿大、波兰三国组成的国际监督和监察委员会，对印度支那各国执行日内瓦协议的情况进行监督和监察。
    日内瓦协议的达成，结束了为时八年的印度支那流血战争，粉碎了美国扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。当时美国拒绝在协议上签字，但被迫发表声明，“保证”将不使用威胁或武力来妨碍日内瓦协议的执行。但是，美国在日内瓦协议达成后不久，即在1954年9月成立了东南亚侵略集团，强把柬埔寨、老挝、南越划进这个集团的“保护地区”内，公然违背了日内瓦协议的规定。随后，美国更明目张胆地非法派遣军事人员和输送武器和战略物资到南越，阻挠越南的统一，并把南越变为美国的军事基地。接着，彻底撕毁关于在老挝停止敌对行动的日内瓦协议，则成为美国的又一阴谋。
    在国际委员会的协助下，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队曾于1956年12月和1957年11月先后两次达成了协议，确定双方成立联合政府，由寮国战斗部队和其他爱国人士所组成的爱国党可进行合法活动，不加歧视地把寮国战斗部队并入老挝王国军队等。但在美国唆使下，老挝王国政府在今年2月11日公开声明片面废弃日内瓦协议，最近又公然出动大批武装部队，包围前寮国战斗部队，阴谋解除他们的武装，同时派军警包围包括苏发努冯亲王在内的前寮国战斗部队的领导人和其他议员的住宅，大批逮捕爱国党党员，阴谋挑起内战以破坏印度支那的和平。老挝王国政府已彻底撕毁了1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议，也彻底撕毁了同寮国战斗部队两次达成的协议。
