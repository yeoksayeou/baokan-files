    Wheat Sea Battle
    By our reporters Ji Xichen and Zhu Shi
    After a winter and spring of hard work and skillful work, the people of Sichuan have won a bountiful summer harvest. Ripe wheat, rapeseed laden with pods, and large peas and broad beans form a golden sea that stretches to the horizon. In the fields, red flags flutter everywhere, songs echo, and tens of thousands of harvesters are waving their sickles and deploying their forces in a tense day and night wheat harvest battle.
            Joyful Fields
    When we arrived at the Guihu People's Commune in Xindu County, over 20,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed had already begun to be harvested. In the Shanwangmiao cultivation area, more than two hundred male and female wheat harvesting team members, some wearing straw hats, some wearing only a short shirt, were waving their sickles in the wheat fields that were chest-deep. The "chachacha" sound of cutting wheat resounded through the fields like the wind. Only when people stood up could their heads be seen from the wheat ears. A young woman named Li Guifang, after cutting a row of wheat, turned her head and shouted loudly: "Seize the wheat in the tiger's mouth, we have to hurry up!"
    The twenty-one mu of "May 1st" fine-breed wheat being harvested have not lodged despite repeated attacks of wind and rain, due to appropriate deep plowing, reasonable close planting, and careful management. The wheat ears in this field are generally two or three inches long and as thick as a finger. With a slight breeze, the wheat ears are squeezed together and make a "chachacha" sound. In previous years, one person could harvest one mu of wheat a day, but this year they can only harvest three or four fen of wheat at most. Women's group leader Wang Guangze is leading more than twenty women, competing to see who can cut the fastest and harvest the most carefully. While cutting wheat, they pick up the scattered wheat ears. The cut wheat piles are densely laid out, truly a rare harvest! Wearing a red floral shirt, Xiong Jingwen, while vigorously waving his sickle, led everyone in singing a song she had written:
    "Walking to Shanwangmiao for a look, hey, this year's crops are extraordinary,
    The wheat grows evenly and strong, large tracts of wheat fields shine with golden light!"
    The carriers who transport the wheat bundles and the threshing team members are closely following the wheat harvesters. The threshing tubs surrounded by reed mats, like white sails sailing on the sea of wheat, whir and clap loudly. On the threshing tubs, young men Wang Youfu and Liu Liuyuan are competing. They are afraid of not threshing cleanly, so after threshing the first time, they neatly stack the wheat stalks aside, preparing for a second threshing. To speed up threshing, the commune has installed fifteen-horsepower motorized combined threshers next to the road. Accompanied by the rumbling of the motors, wheat stalks and wheat grains flow out from both ends of the machines. Not far from here, the members of the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee and Xindu County Committee, specially sent to inspect the yield, are tying large scales to the trees, weighing, calculating, and recording repeatedly to verify the yield. When they announced to everyone that the average actual yield of the twenty-one mu of wheat was six hundred and eight jin per mu, the wheat field was filled with jubilation. Commune member Wang Mingyou held up a handful of plump wheat grains, grinning and saying: "Look! Before collectivization, who had ever seen such good wheat!"
            Battle in the Wind and Rain
    The rush harvest battle had been going on for a day in Zuojia Dam, and just as this large piece of wheat was about to be harvested, suddenly clusters of dark clouds came from the west, covering the sky, and thunder rumbled low across the fields. The commune party committee secretary glanced at the sky and was deciding whether to continue harvesting when large raindrops fell.
    "Comrades! The rain is coming, hurry back to shelter from the rain!" He shouted anxiously to the comrades from the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Sanatorium who came to support the rush harvest, facing the wind and rain. However, these heroes, ignoring his urging, said indifferently: "Humph! We are not afraid of bullets and shells, are we afraid of this little rain!"
    The wind and rain not only did not stop them but spurred these strong people to harvest even more intensively. They were just like on the front line, shouting "Charge up!" "Encircle from both sides!" "A tiger digs out the heart!"
    The members of the amateur performance team, who had just returned from touring around the country, joined the ranks of the rush harvest the day after returning to the sanatorium. Although the local commune did not let them know the harvest date, when they saw that the originally barren Zuojia Dam was now growing golden wheat, they knew that the harvest season had arrived, so they set off to harvest at dawn. Zhang Jiasheng and Huang Tianran, first-class revolutionary disabled soldiers who had lost their hands, tied sickles to their arms with ropes; Zhou Dequan, who was blind in both eyes, squatted on the ground, feeling with his hands as he cut... How could such a spirit not deeply move people!
              Village Lights
    On summer nights, sparse lights are lit in the villages and on the threshing grounds. Some continue the farm work that was not finished during the day, some are calculating the day's harvest, discussing and arranging tomorrow's work.
    On this night, the Zhaodu People's Commune in Jintang, on the banks of the Tuo River, seemed particularly lively. The celebration of the harvest was held under the bright acetylene lamps in the mandarin orange grove. Before the performance, party branch secretary Liao Jiayong told the six or seven hundred people present that the cotton, peanuts, and corn in the entire cultivation area had completed the sowing plan ahead of schedule; wheat and rapeseed had also achieved unprecedented harvests, with yields increasing significantly compared to last year.
    Among the eighty-odd award winners was a production team leader named Zeng Xiangtong. He led sixteen young shock team members to not only overfulfill various tasks during the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting but also actively help others. While ordinary people cut only three or four fen of wheat a day, they cut seven or eight fen of wheat a day. The next day, when we met him on the threshing ground, he said: "Comrade, think about it, seeing such a harvest, who wouldn't work harder!"
            The Bugle Call of Dawn
    At dawn, the bugle call for assembly sounded in the seventh cultivation area of the Wan'an People's Commune. However, when we ran along the mud road to the wheat field, in the dim morning light, people were already harvesting wheat. Old man Sun Hongshun, with a white beard, straightened his back after cutting a row of wheat, stroking a handful of wheat ears and said to us: "Look, these wheat ears are heavy and hit my hand." Min Changqing, the party branch secretary who was cutting wheat with him, said that this was the result of soaring enthusiasm and improved farming techniques. The soil here was originally very barren, and even green manure vetch could not grow, but after collectivization last year, this dam area was deep-plowed to about one and a half feet, and smoked soil fertilizer was universally applied (more than 100,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu was applied in layers); wheat field management was tightly grasped from beginning to end, and there were no pests or lodging. But people are not satisfied with the existing achievements. He said that compared to last year, this year is better, but compared to the Party's requirements, it is still far behind!
    In order to strive for a greater autumn harvest, rush harvesting and rush planting are proceeding simultaneously. Such scenes often appear in the fields: the wheat and rapeseed have just been cut off at one end of the field, and base fertilizer is already being applied and the land is being plowed and rice is being planted at the other end. In order to seize the time and grasp the season, plowing team leader Chen Quanjin drove five oxen and went to the field in the dark before the moon had set. Five people adopted the "chasing tandem" plowing method, with two plows working in the same furrow at the same time, which was very efficient. By the time for breakfast, he had plowed more than five mu of land. When people congratulated him, he said: "Don't rush! Wait until we harvest the grain in the autumn and win the red flag, then we'll talk!"

    麦海大战
    本报记者  纪希晨  朱实
    经过一冬一春的苦干巧干，四川人民赢得了丰收的夏天。成熟了的麦子、结荚累累的油菜，又密又大的豌豆、蚕豆，像金黄色的海洋，一直延伸到天边。田野上，到处红旗招展，歌声荡漾，成千成万的抢收大军，挥镰摆阵，日夜紧张地进行麦收大战。
            欢腾的田野
    当我们来到新都县桂湖人民公社的时候，这里的两万多亩小麦、油菜已经开镰收割。在山王庙耕作区的二百多名男女收麦队员，有的戴着草帽，有的只穿件短衫，在深及胸脯的麦陇里挥着镰刀，“喳喳”的割麦声，刮风似的响过田间。只有当人们站起来的时候，头顶才从麦穗中露出来。一个名叫李桂芳的女青年，割完一厢麦，她就扭过头大声招呼：“龙口里夺麦，可得快点咧！”
    正在收割的二十一亩“五一”良种小麦，由于深耕适当，密植合理，管理精细，虽曾多次遭到风雨袭击，没有倒伏过。这块田的麦穗普遍有两三寸长，一指头粗，稍微刮点风，麦穗就挤得“喳喳”发响。往年一个人一天能割一亩小麦，可是今年顶多只能割三四分地的麦子。妇女小组长王光泽带领着二十多个妇女，正在比谁割得快，谁收得细致，她们一边割麦，一边把撒了的麦穗拾起来。割倒的麦堆，铺得密密的，真是罕有的丰收！穿着红花衫的熊景文，一面使劲地挥着镰刀，一面带领大家唱着自己编的歌子：
    “走到山王庙望一望，嗨，今年的庄稼不寻常，
    麦子生得齐又壮，大片麦地放金光！”
    抢运麦捆的挑运员和脱粒队员，紧跟在收麦队员的后面。围起席棚的打麦拌桶，像航行在麦海上的白帆，呼呼拍拍直响。在脱粒用的拌桶上，小伙子王有福和刘六元正在比赛，他们害怕打不干净，所以每打完第一道，就把麦秆整齐地堆放在一边，准备第二次再打。为了加速脱粒，公社在马路旁边安起了十五马力的机动联合脱粒机，伴着轰轰隆隆的马达声，麦秸和麦粒分别从机器两端流出来。离这里不远，是中共温江地委和新都县委专门派来验收产量的人员，他们在树上绑起大秤，边秤边算边记，反复核实产量。当他们把二十一亩小麦平均每亩实收六百零八斤的消息向大家宣布的时候，麦地里顿时一片欢腾。社员王明友捧起一把饱咕咕的麦粒，裂嘴笑着说：“看！公社化以前，哪见过这样好的小麦！”
            风雨中的激战
    抢割战斗，在左家坝已经打响了一天，眼看这一大块小麦就要割完，突然一团团乌云从西方盖天扑来，雷声低沉地响过田间。公社党委书记望了一下天空，正在决定是否要继续收割下去的时候，大颗的雨点落了下来。
    “同志们！雨来了，赶快回去躲雨呵！”他迎着风雨，焦急地向来支援抢收的四川省革命残废军人教养院的同志们大声呼喊。可是，这些英雄们，不顾他催促，满不在乎地说：“哼！枪炮子弹都不怕，还怕这点雨！”
    风雨不但没有阻挡住他们，反而促使这些坚强的人，更加紧张地进行收割。他们就如同在火线上一样，叫喊着“攻上去呵！”“两面包围呵！”“来个老虎掏心战呀！”
    刚刚在全国各地巡回演出回来的业余演出队队员，回到教养院的第二天，就参加了抢收的行列。尽管当地公社不让他们知道收割的日期，可是当他们看到原来土质薄瘦的左家坝如今也长起金光闪闪的麦子时，知道已经到了收割的时期，于是天一亮便出发去收割。截去了双手的一等革命残废军人张家声和黄天然，用绳子把镰刀绑在胳臂上；双目失明的周德泉，则蹲在地上，用手摸着割……。这种精神，怎能不深深地使人感动！
              村野的灯火
    夏天的夜晚，村子里，麦场上，亮起了稀疏的灯火。有的人继续着白天没有完结的农活，有的在计算着一天的收成，讨论和布置着明天的工作。
    这天晚上，沱江岸上的金堂赵渡人民公社，显得特别热闹。庆祝丰收的贺功会，在广柑林里的明亮汽灯下进行着。表演节目前，党分支书记廖家永向到会的六七百人说，全耕作区的棉花、花生、玉米已经提早完成了播种计划；麦子、油菜也获得空前丰收，产量比去年增加很多。
    在八十多个得奖人中，有一个名叫曾祥通的生产队长，他曾带领十六个青年突击队员，在夏收夏种的紧张时刻，不仅超额完成各种任务，并且积极帮助别人，一般人一天只割三分多地的麦子，他们一天割七八分地。第二天，当我们在打麦场上见到他的时候，他说：“同志，你想嘛，看到这样的丰收，谁还会不加劲干！”
            黎明的号声
    黎明，万安人民公社第七耕作区响起了集合出发的号声。可是，当我们沿着泥路，跑到麦地里去的时候，晨色苍茫中，早已有人在割麦了。白胡子老汉孙宏顺割完一排麦，直起腰来，捋着一把麦穗对我们说：“看，这麦穗沉甸甸的直打手。”和他在一起割麦的党支部书记闵长清说，这是干劲冲天和改进耕作技术的结果。这儿土质原来十分瘠瘦，甚至连绿肥苕子也长不起，可是去年公社化后，这一坝地都深耕一尺五寸左右，结合深耕又普遍上了一遍熏土肥（每亩分层施底肥十多万斤）；麦田管理自始至终抓得紧，没有发生虫害和倒伏。可是人们并不满足已有的成就，他说，比起去年今年是好了，可是比起党的要求，那还差得远呢！
    为争取秋季更大丰收，抢收抢种正同时并进着。田野上常常出现这样的情景：地这头刚刚把麦子油菜割掉，地那头已经在送撒底肥，开始犁翻土地，栽种水稻了。为了抢时间、抓季节，犁田突击队长陈全金赶着五条牛，月亮还没落，就摸黑上地了。五个人采用“撵趟子”的套耕法，两支犁同时在一个犁沟工作，效率很高。临到吃早饭，他已翻耕了五亩多地。当人们向他祝贺时，他说：“莫忙嘛！等秋后打下粮食，夺下红旗，再说吧！”
