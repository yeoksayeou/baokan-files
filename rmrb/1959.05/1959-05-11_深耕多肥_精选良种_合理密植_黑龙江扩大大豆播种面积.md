Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 9th May. The vast areas of Heilongjiang Province, famous for producing soybeans, have now generally begun sowing soybeans. As of May 5th, more than five million mu of soybeans had been sown throughout the province. In the southern regions, where the temperature is higher, the tender green and plump soybean sprouts have already emerged from the ground.

Heilongjiang Province plans to sow 21 million mu of soybeans this year, an increase of 11% over last year. Before sowing, people's communes and state farms in various regions summarized their soybean high-yield experiences from last year and made preparations for soybean sowing in advance. The majority of the land for sowing soybeans has undergone deep plowing, leveling, and layered fertilization. In Baiquan County, where the soybean planting area is relatively large, most of the land is fertilized with 50,000 to 60,000 jin per hectare, and 40% of the area is high-yield fields.

Most of the soybeans sown throughout the province this year are improved varieties such as Manchurian Gold, Jingshan Pu, and Tieyingqing, which have generally undergone grain selection and screening before sowing. In some counties, the seed germination rate has reached over 95%. Due to the use of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural implements for sowing, many regions have achieved rational close planting, and some places have even achieved equidistant planting, with the number of seedlings per mu increasing by approximately 10% to 15% compared to previous years. Heilongjiang Province is one of the provinces in China that produces the most soybeans. The sowing area has always ranked first or second in the country. To ensure increased soybean production this year, Party secretaries at all levels have personally led this production, and production teams of all people's communes have established production responsibility systems.

    深耕多肥　精选良种　合理密植
    黑龙江扩大大豆播种面积
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　以出产大豆闻名的黑龙江省广大地区，目前已普遍开始播种大豆。到本月5日止，全省已播种大豆五百多万亩，气温较高的南部地区，嫩绿肥大的大豆芽瓣已经钻出地面。
    黑龙江省今年计划播种大豆两千一百万亩，比去年增加11％。各地人民公社和国营农场在播种前都总结了去年的大豆丰产经验，并且提前作好了大豆播种的准备工作。播种大豆的土地绝大部分经过深翻、整地和分层施肥。大豆播种面积较多的拜泉县，大部分土地每垧施肥五、六万斤，并且有40％的大面积丰产田。
    今年全省播种的大豆大部分是满仓金、荆山璞、铁英青等良种，播种前普遍经过粒选和筛选。有的县种子出芽率达到95％以上。由于采用了机械化、半机械化农具播种，因此，许多地区都做到了合理密植，有不少地方还做到了等距播种，每亩苗数大约比往年增加10％到15％。黑龙江省是我国出产大豆最多的省份之一。播种面积一向居全国第一、二位。为了确保今年大豆增产，各级党委书记都亲自领导了这项生产，各人民公社生产队都建立了生产责任制。
