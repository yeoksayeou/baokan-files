The Creations of Boatmen

    Fish Belly Boat
    The fish belly boat created by Feng Shunhe, a veteran worker at the Leshan Shipyard, is currently the best type of vessel for water transport in Sichuan Province. It has a shallow draft, large carrying capacity, strong water splitting ability, and is safe and stable when passing through shoals, without being restricted by waterways.
    This type of boat is modified from existing vessels. The production is simple, only requiring the addition of fish belly-shaped "protective cages" (i.e., plywood) on both sides of the hull to increase the buoyancy of the boat. The length of the protective cage starts from the dragon bar head to the rear foot socket, gradually extending outward in an arc shape. The height gradually slopes outward from the bottom layer (i.e., above the waterline of the empty boat) to seventy degrees, leveling with the deck. The width of the protective cage should be determined based on the boat and waterway conditions. Modifying a fish belly boat only adds 0.6 cubic meters of wood, 1.6 jin of iron nails, and 0.6 jin of tung oil, but the carrying capacity can be increased by more than 60%, and the transportation cost per ton of goods can be reduced by 80%.

    Earthen Beacon
    The simple earthen beacon for night navigation was created by wooden boat workers on the Qujiang River, which has many shoals and rapid currents. This earthen beacon is made of a triangular base of bamboo or wood, with a conical frame installed on top. The frame suspends a colored glass oil lamp as a marker. Setting up these beacons on both sides of the navigation channel and on visible and submerged reefs can indicate the route for navigation. The cost of an earthen beacon is only about two yuan, and it consumes two to three ounces of oil per night, but it can double the efficiency of shipping.

    Three-Section Boat
    The appearance of the three-section boat is the same as that of ordinary wooden boats, but it can be disassembled into three sections. When put into the water, it is used as a towing barge for wooden boats; when going upstream, it is disassembled and loaded onto the main boat. According to the quota, one boat can save three laborers.
    This boat is divided into front, middle, and rear sections. The front and rear sections have the same structure. The connection method is to use two pressure bars, respectively clamping them at the joints of the front and rear sections, and then tightening them with screws.

    Cable Car Type Hydraulic Beaching Machine
    The cable car type hydraulic beaching machine was created by Tang Tianwen, a veteran shipbuilding worker at Mianyang Port. This beaching machine does not require manual operation and relies entirely on water power, eliminating the intense physical labor of pulling boats over shoals for thousands of years. It can increase work efficiency by more than ten times compared to the original manual beaching.
    This beaching machine is mostly made of wood. Install a sturdy pulley on the shoal head, and use a rope or rattan that is longer than the shoal, passing it through the pulley, with a small boat with a water resistance box tied to each end. When crossing the shoal, tie the boat to be hauled to the small boat below the shoal entrance, and put the water resistance box of the small boat on the shoal in place. The small boat will be violently impacted towards the shoal entrance by the rapid current, quickly pulling the boat below the shoal entrance up. The two small boats operate alternately, one up and one down. The steeper and longer the shoal, and the greater the water flow velocity, the faster the speed of the boat going up the shoal, and the higher the efficiency. (Attached picture)

    船工的创造
    鱼肚船
    乐山造船厂老工人冯顺和创造的鱼肚船，是四川省目前水力运输上最优良的船型，吃水浅、载运量大、分水力强，过滩安全稳当，不受航道限制。
    这种船是在原有船只基础上改制的，制作简便，只在船舷两边加上鱼肚形的“护笼”（就是合板），以增加船只的浮力就行。护笼的长度，从龙枋头起，到后脚窝止，逐步向外伸延，成为弧形。高度从下面铺杆起（即空船的吃水线以上），逐步向外倾斜到七十度与船面相平。护笼的宽度要以船只和航道条件来决定。改一只鱼肚船，只增加零点六立方公尺木料、一点六斤铁钉、零点六斤桐油，而载重量能提高60％以上，每吨货运输成本能降低80％。
    土灯标
    夜航简易土灯标是滩多流急的渠江木船工人创造的。这种土灯标是用竹子或木料制成的三角形底盘，上面安上椎形支架；支架悬挂一个带颜色的玻璃油灯，作为标志。把这种灯标设置在漕道的两侧和明暗礁上，便可以指示航行。一只土灯标的成本仅值两元左右，每晚耗油二两到三两，但可以使航运效率翻一番。
    三节船
    三节船的外形与一般木船一样，但是可以拆开分为三节；下水作木船的拖驳用，上水拆开装在主船上。按配额，一只船可节约三个劳动力。
    这种船分前、中、后三节。前后二节构造一样。连接的方法是用两根压筋，分别卡在前后节的接头处，然后以螺丝钉旋紧。
    缆车式水力绞滩机
    缆车式水力绞滩机是绵阳港造船老工人唐天文创造的。这种绞滩机不用人力操作，完全靠水力，消灭了几千年来拉船过滩时的强烈的体力劳动，比原来人力拉滩，可以提高工效十倍多。
    这种绞滩机大部分是用木头制成的。在滩头上安装一个牢固的滑车，用一根比滩长一些的鍖绳或纤藤，通过滑车，两头各拴一只带有阻水箱的小船。过滩时，把行船拴在滩口下的小船上，把滩上小船的阻水箱放好，小船便被急流猛向滩口冲击，把滩口下的船迅速拉上来，两个小船一上一下交叉操作。滩愈陡、愈长、水流速愈大，行船上滩的速度也就愈快，效率也愈高。（附图片）
