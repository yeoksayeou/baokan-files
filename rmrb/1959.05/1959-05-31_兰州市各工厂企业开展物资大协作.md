Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 30th: In Lanzhou, one can now see people beating gongs and drums daily, delivering their unused or temporarily idle materials to units in urgent need. This is a new trend emerging in the material collaboration among enterprises in Lanzhou after clearing out their warehouses.

Because the Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory lacked three hundred screws of the appropriate specifications, the newly arrived twenty-four looms could not be installed and put into production; the soft water workshop could not be completed on time because it lacked a two-hundred-millimeter large seamless steel pipe. After this situation was reported, the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory sent seamless steel pipes, and the Lanzhou Automobile Parts Factory sent screws, helping the wool textile factory overcome its difficulties. The Lanzhou Public Utilities Bureau, knowing that the first phase of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant's fertilizer workshop urgently needed 277 meters of 6,000-volt cable, gave its own 320 meters of 6,000-volt cable to the chemical plant. The Lanzhou Refinery, hearing that the Lanzhou Chemical Plant lacked welding rods and refractory bricks, immediately sent one ton of surplus welding rods and nine thousand refractory bricks from its own factory. The Lanzhou Chemical Plant also freed up one hundred bottles of oxygen to support the Lanzhou Refinery, ensuring the smooth progress of the welding work for the Lanzhou Refinery's installation project.

In the process of clearing warehouses in the first quarter of this year, enterprises in Lanzhou found that they had a considerable amount of stockpiled materials, including steel, wood, cement, and major equipment. In order to effectively use these materials, the enterprises conducted ideological education for their employees on the concept of "the whole country as a single chessboard," and then launched a material collaboration campaign. Currently, more than 3,800 tons of steel, more than 330 sets of major equipment, and more than 228,000 pieces of other tools and accessories are being mutually adjusted between enterprises at both the provincial and municipal levels.

    兰州市各工厂企业开展物资大协作
    新华社兰州30日电　在兰州市，现在每天可以看到人们敲锣打鼓，把自己不用或暂时不用的物资送去支援急需的单位。这是兰州市各企业在清理仓库以后开展物资大协作中出现的新风尚。
    兰州毛纺织厂因为缺乏三百只适合规格的螺丝，新到的二十四台织机无法安装起来投入生产；软水车间因为缺乏一根二百公厘的大型无缝钢管，不能按时竣工。这个情况传出后，兰州石油化工机器厂就送来了无缝钢管，兰州汽车配件厂送来了螺丝，帮助毛纺厂克服了困难。兰州市公用局知道兰州化工厂肥料车间第一期工程急需二百七十七公尺六千伏电缆，就将自己的三百二十公尺六千伏电缆送给化工厂。兰州炼油厂听说兰州化工厂缺少电焊条和耐火砖，就立即将本厂多余的电焊条一吨、耐火砖九千块送去。兰州化工厂也腾出一百瓶氧气支援兰州炼油厂，使兰州炼油厂安装工程的焊接工作顺利进行。
    兰州市各企业在今年第一季度清理仓库过程中，发现积存物资相当多，其中有钢材、木材、水泥以及主要设备等等。为了有效地使用这些物资，各企业对职工进行了“全国一盘棋”的思想教育，接着开展物资大协作运动。现在，将在省市两级各企业互相调剂的钢材有三千八百多吨，主要设备三百三十多台，其他工具配件二十二万八千多件。
