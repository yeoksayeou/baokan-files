The hometown of China's Shui people is in Sandu Shui Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, on the upper reaches of the Douliu River and its surroundings. There, the mountains stretch endlessly, streams crisscross, and silvery rivers, like the flower borders on the Shui girls' clothing, surround the mountains that often disappear into the clouds. More than 150,000 Shui people live in such a "beautiful place like a phoenix feather."

This area has a mild climate, abundant rainfall, and fertile land, suitable for growing various crops, with abundant rice, cotton, and green ramie. Local specialties include tung oil, fragrant mushrooms, Chinese gall, Eucommia ulmoides, and dozens of other items, which are sold throughout the country. The fir, pine, and nan bamboo on both sides of the upper reaches of the Douliu River are transported in large quantities to support construction projects throughout the motherland.

The Shui area is rich in mineral resources. Iron, mercury, coal, zinc, lead, sulfur, and other minerals have already been discovered.

The newly built highways closely link the Shui area with the rest of the country. One runs from Sandu Shui Autonomous County to Duyun City, the capital of Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, connecting to the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway; the other runs through the entire Shui settlement area to Dushan County. In addition, the Douliu River is navigable by wooden boats, reaching Liuzhou City, Guangxi, via Rongjiang County.

The Shui are a nation with a long history and rich cultural traditions. They settled in the area of what is now Sandu Shui Autonomous County about a thousand years ago. Their language belongs to the Kam-Sui language family and is related to Dong, Buyi, and Zhuang languages. The Shui also have a special script called "Shui Shu," with only a hundred or so characters. It has always been used in religious activities, but is not commonly used in daily life. Shui folk literature and art are also rich, including oral literature, dance, paper-cutting, embroidery, and stone carving.

The Shui people have continuously fought against reactionary rulers, forging a flesh-and-blood relationship with the working people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. After the outbreak of the Taiping Rebellion, the Shui people, under the leadership of Pan Xinjiand others, united with neighboring fraternal ethnic groups to respond, and the struggle lasted for fifteen years. In 1930, the Seventh and Eighth Corps of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through the Shui area on their way from Guangxi to the Jiangxi Soviet area, greatly encouraging the Shui people's fighting spirit and confidence in victory. Since then, the Shui people have bravely struggled against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, one after another.

In 1949, under the leadership of the Party, the Shui people, along with all ethnic groups, were liberated. In the past ten years, the Shui area has successively completed various democratic reforms and achieved great success in economic and cultural construction. The establishment of Sandu Shui Autonomous County on January 2, 1957, realized the long-cherished dream of the Shui people.

    都柳江边的水族
    在都柳江上游贵州省三都水族自治县和它周围，是我国水族人民的故乡。那里，山岭连绵，溪流交错，银白色的河流，像水族姑娘衣裳上的道道花边，环绕着时常隐没在云雾中的群山。十五万多水族人民就生活在这样一个“像凤凰羽毛一样美丽”的地方。
    这片地区气候温和，雨量充沛，土地肥沃，适合各种作物生长，盛产水稻、棉花、青麻。土特产有桐油、香菌、五棓子、杜仲等数十种，远销全国各地。都柳江上游两岸的杉、松、楠竹，大量外运支援祖国各地建设事业。
    水族地区蕴藏着丰富的矿产。目前已经发现铁、汞、煤、锌、铅、硫等矿。
    新修的公路把水族地区和全国紧密联系起来。一条从三都水族自治县到黔南布依族苗族自治州首府都匀市，与黔桂铁路相衔接；另一条贯穿整个水族聚居区通往独山县。此外，都柳江可通行木船，经榕江县抵广西柳州市。
    水族是一个具有悠久历史和丰富文化传统的民族，大约在一千年以前，就定居在现在的三都水族自治县一带。他们的语言属于侗水语支，和侗语、布依语、僮语都有亲属关系。水族还有一种特殊的文字，叫作“水书”，只有一百多个字，它一直是在宗教活动中使用的文字，但在日常生活中不通用。水族的民间文学、艺术也很丰富，有口头文学、舞蹈，还有剪纸、刺绣、石刻等。
    水族人民曾经向反动统治者不断地进行过斗争，与祖国各族劳动人民结下了血肉的关系。太平天国革命爆发后，水族人民在潘新简等人的领导下，联合邻近各兄弟民族起来响应，斗争延续了十五年。1930年，中国工农红军第七、八军由广西到江西苏区的途中，经过了水族地区，大大鼓舞了水族人民的斗争意志和胜利信心。此后，水族人民前仆后继地进行了反抗国民党反动统治的英勇斗争。
    1949年，水族人民在党的领导下，和各族人民一起获得了解放。近十年来，水族地区相继完成了各项民主改革，并在经济文化建设事业上取得巨大成绩。1957年1月2日三都水族自治县建立，实现了水族人民多年来梦寐以求的愿望。
