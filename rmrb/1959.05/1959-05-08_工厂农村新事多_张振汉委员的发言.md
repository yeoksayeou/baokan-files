After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's "Work Report of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC," I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support them.

This time, I inspected Hubei and Henan, studied the urban people's communes of Wuhan and Zhengzhou, and visited Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Heavy Machinery Plant, No. 1 Cotton Mill, Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory, Meat Joint Processing Factory, the Second Hospital of Wuhan Medical College, the Luoyang Tractor Factory, Bearing Factory, and the Sanmenxia Project. In addition, I also visited Yangdang People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei.

Although the urban people's communes in Wuhan and Zhengzhou are somewhat different, their achievements are remarkable. The questions I wanted to know were satisfactorily resolved, and I also gained unexpected insights into some problems I hadn't thought of. I was greatly inspired.

　　Factories Are Generally Making Great Leaps Forward

The factories I saw are generally making great leaps forward. For example, Wuhan Iron and Steel's production combat goals are: to reduce investment by half, double production, and shorten the construction period by half. The Heavy Machinery Plant has increased its original annual output by two times, and will present five celebratory gifts for National Day this year, including a five-meter gantry planer weighing 320 tons. The No. 1 Cotton Mill made its old machines, some over forty years old, "rejuvenate," and its production capacity is equivalent to that of modern spinning machines. After improving the old looms, the production quantity increased to "one cloth per machine, one shift, surpassing the Seven Fairies." The leaps forward in Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory and the Meat Processing Factory have both doubled. The Second Hospital of Wuhan Medical College has made great leaps forward. Taking the number of beds as an example, the original 400 have continued to increase to 700 to 1,000, and now there are 1,600 beds. The task has increased, the staff has decreased, and the outpatient clinic is so busy that it averages about six minutes to diagnose a patient. The Luoyang Tractor Factory leaped to five times its original annual production task, reduced investment by 60 million yuan, and additionally built 100,000 square meters of factory buildings. The Luoyang Bearing Factory exceeded its original 1960 target in 1958. This year's task is initially set at 25 million sets, and it can still be increased. The Sanmenxia Project was completed two and a half years ahead of schedule. If the customized power generation equipment can be delivered on time according to the great leap forward schedule, electricity can be generated by National Day next year, as a gift to National Day. The above facts illustrate the comprehensive great leap forward, which has greatly encouraged me.

The factories I saw have all established many satellite factories, solving their own needs, reducing the burden on the central government, and supporting the needs of various fraternal factories, mines, and agriculture. For example, the steelmaking furnace of the No. 1 Cotton Mill is an advanced production furnace in Wuhan. Director Fu of the Meat Joint Processing Factory told us: "Except for the 'sound of pigs squealing,' which is useless, everything on the pig's body is useful. After processing, it is made into medicines and other varieties, increasing income. Pork has become a cost-free commodity, and one ton of pork can be exchanged for five tons of high-quality steel." I think it is possible for everyone to eat a few pounds less pork in a year. Then it can be used to exchange for a large amount of high-quality steel, which can promote China's socialist construction. I think this is also a way for every patriotic citizen to increase production and practice economy.

The factories I saw have all trained a large number of technical personnel and other staff. For example, the Sanmenxia Project has trained party committee secretaries, factory directors, engineers, and technical personnel for the Liujiaxia, Qingtongxia, and Danjiang water conservancy projects. For example, Wuhan Iron and Steel has undertaken the task of contracting the Yidu Steel Plant. This measure prepares a reserve force for building socialism.

The factories I saw have all implemented the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and followed the "mass line." They have all implemented the general line's "walking on two legs" method. The achievements are great and brilliant. In particular, the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and "communist large-scale collaboration" has been promoted. The responsible comrades of each factory told us: "The great leap forward must have great collaboration. We must do our best to support the needs of various fraternal factories, mines, and agriculture. Even if it increases our own difficulties, we must do so." This communist style is a manifestation of the noble qualities of the working class. I am moved. I realize that only the working class can have such inspiring achievements, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such great feats. I am encouraged, I am moved, and I am even more educated. Inspiring deeds cannot be written in dozens of articles, so I will stop here. I would like to talk about the new socialist village - Yangdang New Village.

　　Socialist New Village Is Good

Yangdang New Village is the first completed new village among the eight socialist new villages planned to be built by Yangdang People's Commune. Yangdang People's Commune is located in the northwest of Zaoyang County, Hubei Province. It used to be a low-yielding area and suffered poverty year after year in the old society. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, agricultural production has increased year after year. Especially in 1958, under the illumination of the general line, agricultural production made a great leap forward, and grain and cotton production increased by more than two times. In order to develop the people's commune, meet the needs of production, and satisfy the demands of the commune members, it was decided to build eight socialist new villages. Utilizing the slack season of agriculture, Yangdang New Village was built first. Construction started on November 20, 1958, and it took a total of 100 days to build 3,018 houses, including 2,476 houses for commune members. The remaining houses were used for hospitals, primary schools, canteens, kindergartens, nurseries, cultural palaces, homes for the elderly, and financial departments.

When we arrived at Yangdang, we saw a large auditorium that could accommodate more than 2,000 people, and several young girls were painting the doors and windows. We visited several households that had already moved in. They said: "We never dreamed that we could live in such tall and good houses. The houses we used to live in were small and short, and they leaked when it rained. Now we don't have to worry about the house leaking when it rains." We arrived at the department store that was already open. The goods were complete, including not only various printed fabrics, but also various fragrances and perfumes, and various canned goods and various wines to eat. The department store on the main street was being painted. All kinds of use rooms were available, and the road was as wide as some roads in Beijing. Building 3,018 houses in 100 days is indeed a construction of great ambition. It is a magnificent socialist new village, which has set a demonstration role for the future construction of new villages and has encouraged the commune members.

Before and after our visit to the new village, we repeatedly inquired about the construction process. According to the information obtained, it was not an easy task. Yangdang New Village was built with materials dismantled from old houses. Yangdang lacked materials, technical personnel, and even engineers. The masses had some ideological difficulties. They believed that it could not be done only by relying on "old methods." The commune leaders grasped the thoughts of the masses and took the following appropriate measures:

1.  Give prominence to politics, mobilize all the people, improve the organization, and strengthen the leadership. In terms of organization, a political department and command headquarters for the construction of the new village were established. The party committee secretary and deputy secretary served as the director and deputy director of the political department, respectively, and the township head and deputy township head served as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. Two offices, office and inspection, and six sections were set up, so that there was a clear division of labor and responsibility at all levels.

2.  In terms of ideology, a red flag movement was launched, with the general line as the guiding principle and socialist and communist education as the driving force. Propaganda and education were carried out. Seven cultural and artistic troupes and a propaganda army of more than 5,000 people were organized and assigned to various work teams to eat, live, and work together to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. In response to ideological conditions, rectification was carried out at the construction site, using big-character posters, free airing of views, free airing of views, and great debates. Where there was no consensus, free airing of views and great debates were carried out. For example, debating why the new village was being built, for whom the new village was being built, who to rely on to build the new village, how to build the new village in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and whether the new village could be built in a self-reliant way with old materials.

3.  Carry out large-scale technological innovation and improve tools. At the construction site, carry out the struggle between "indigenous and foreign," the struggle between "fast and slow," the struggle between "economical and wasteful," the struggle between "advanced" and "backward," and the struggle against "conservative" thinking. Through free airing of views and great debates, on-site visits, accounting comparisons, and running red and expert schools on the spot, the method of teachers leading apprentices was used to carry out the movement of everyone engaging in experimentation, everyone learning technology, and one person having multiple skills. Achieve learning in three days, mastering in five days, and graduating in seven days. In this way, 4,370 people were trained as bricklayers, carpenters, lime burners, brick and tile burners, painters, and plasterers.

4.  Carry out large-scale experimental housing. Focus on experiments first, gain experience, and promote them comprehensively. Starting with the team secretary, all secretaries must engage in experimental housing. There are "August 1st" experimental housing for demobilized soldiers, "March 8th" experimental housing for women, super-teacher experimental housing for secretaries, and teacher-free experimental housing. At the same time, launch a conservation campaign to educate cadres and the masses to cherish every brick and every piece of wood, make the most of large materials, and not waste small materials.

5.  Care about the lives and safety of the masses. Make the masses eat well and eat enough. Increase half a catty of oil per person per month. Slaughter a total of 2,600 pigs and sheep. Add meals once every three days. Work is tight and leisure, so that the masses sleep well and have good entertainment. Always keep the masses full of spirit, and the attendance rate reaches more than 99%.

Yangdang New Village was built in the face of numerous difficulties. From the various measures taken, the Party's guidelines, policies, and lines have been implemented to every grassroots cadre, and every grassroots cadre has learned to use the Party's and Chairman Mao's leadership methods and working methods. The cadres have all mastered Marxist-Leninist theory and applied it to practical work. More importantly, we have seen the infinite wisdom and great creation of the working people. In Yangdang, I received an education in learning from the working people and attended a class that combined theory with practice.

### 工厂农村新事多  张振汉委员的发言

　　工厂农村新事多
    张振汉委员的发言
    听了周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，李维汉副主席的“政协二届常委会工作报告”，我完全同意并衷心拥护。
    这次我到湖北、河南视察，学习武汉和郑州两市的城市人民公社，并看了武汉的武钢、重型机器厂、第一纱厂、天一印染厂、肉类联合加工厂、武汉医学院第二医院、洛阳的拖拉机厂、轴承厂和三门峡工程，另外还看了湖北枣阳县杨垱人民公社。
    武汉市和郑州市的城市人民公社虽然有些不同，但是成就都是了不起的，我想知道的一些问题都得到圆满的解决，还有我没有想到的一些问题，也得到了意外的收获，我受到的启示很大。
　　工厂普遍大跃进
    所看到的工厂都普遍的大跃进。如武钢的生产战斗目标：投资减一半，生产加一倍，工期缩短一半。重型机器厂比原定年产量增加两倍，今年国庆节有五项献礼，其中有五米龙门刨床重三百二十吨。第一纱厂将四十多年的老机器使它“返老还童”，它的生产能力，相当于现代纺纱机的生产能力，将老旧的织布机改进后提高到“一机一班一匹布，赛过七仙姑”的生产数量。天一印染厂、肉类加工厂的跃进，都翻了一番。武汉医学院第二医院，跃进的很大，就拿床位来说，原来四百个继续增加到七百个至一千个，现在有一千六百个床位，任务加大了，人员减少了，门诊忙到平均约六分钟诊断一个病人。洛阳的拖拉机厂，比原定年产任务跃到五倍，并且减少六千万元的投资，还另外增建了十万平方公尺的厂房。洛阳轴承厂，一九五八年就超过了原订一九六○年的指标，今年的任务初定二千五百万套，还能再增加。三门峡工程，提前二年半完成，如果定制的发电机器能按跃进的时间交货，明年国庆节就可以发电，向国庆节献礼。以上的事实说明了全面大跃进，使我受到莫大的鼓舞。
    所看到的工厂，都办了不少的卫星厂，解决了自己的需要，减轻了中央的负担，支援了各兄弟厂矿和工农业的需要。如第一纱厂的炼钢炉，是武汉市的先进生产炉。肉类联合加工厂的富厂长向我们说：“除了‘猪叫的声音’无有用处以外，所有猪身上的东西都有用，经过加工制成药品和其他的品种，增加收益，猪肉成了无本的货品，用一吨猪肉可以换取五吨优质钢材。”我想每一个人在一年之中少吃几斤猪肉，是可以做得到的。那么就可用之换取数量很大的优质钢材，就可以促进我国社会主义建设。我认为这也是每个爱国公民增产节约的一个途径。
    所看到的工厂，都培训了大批技术人员和其他工作人员。如三门峡工程为刘家峡，青铜峡，丹江等水利工程培训的有党委书记，有厂长，有工程师和技术等项人员。如武钢承担了包干宜都钢厂的任务，这个措施为建设社会主义准备了后备力量。
    所看到的工厂，都贯彻执行了“两参一改三结合”和走“群众路线”的方针，都执行总路线“两条腿走路”的方法，成绩是伟大的、辉煌的。特别是发扬了“全国一盘棋”的“共产主义大协作”精神，各厂的负责同志向我们说：“大跃进必须大协作，要尽量的支援各兄弟厂矿和工农业的需要，就是增加自己的困难，也必须那样做。”这样的共产主义风格，是工人阶级高贵品质的表现，我受到感动。我体会到只有工人阶级才能有这样振奋人心的事绩，只有在共产党领导下才能有这样的丰功伟迹，我受到鼓舞，我受到感动，我更受到教育。振奋人心的事写几十篇也写不完，就说到此处。我想谈一谈社会主义新村——杨垱新村。
　　社会主义新村好
    杨垱新村是杨垱人民公社计划建设八个社会主义新村中的一个先建成的新村。杨垱人民公社位于湖北枣阳县西北部，原系薄产地区，在旧社会时，年年受穷。解放后，在党的正确领导下，农业生产年年增产，特别是一九五八年在总路线的照耀下，农业大跃进，粮、棉增产两倍多。为了人民公社化的发展，生产的需要和社员的要求，决定建设八个社会主义新村，利用农闲时间，先建杨垱新村。由一九五八年十一月二十日开始动工，共用了一百天的时间，建成三千零一十八间房屋，其中有社员住的房屋二千四百七十六间，其余的房屋分别用于卫生院，小学校，食堂，幼儿园，托儿所，文化宫，敬老院和财经部门等用房。
    我们到杨垱时，看见能容二千多人的大礼堂，有几个小姑娘正在油漆门窗。访问了已搬入住的几户，她们说：“做梦也未想到能住上这样高大的好房子，以前住的房子又小又矮，一下雨就漏，现在再也不愁下雨房子漏了。”我们到了已经营业的百货商店，货品齐全，不仅有各种花布，还有各种香粉和香水，吃的有各种罐头和各种酒。正街上的百货公司正在粉刷，各种使用房都有，马路像北京有些马路那样宽。一百天建成三千零一十八间房屋，确实是个大气魄的建设，是一个规模宏伟的社会主义新村，为将来建设新村起了示范作用，并且鼓舞了社员。
    在我们参观新村的前后，一再的询问建设的经过，据介绍所得的情况，更觉得不是一件容易的事。杨垱新村系用拆旧房料建成的，杨垱缺少材料，缺少技术人员，更没有工程师，群众在思想上有些搞不通，他们认为光凭“老土”办不成的。公社领导同志抓住群众思想，采取了以下的适当措施：
    一、政治挂帅，全民动员，健全组织，加强领导。在组织方面，成立建设新村政治部和指挥部，党委正副书记分别任政治部正副主任，正副乡长分别任正副指挥，下设办公和检查两室、六个科，作到具体分工，层层负责。
    二、在思想方面展开思想插红旗运动，以总路线为纲，以社会主义和共产主义教育为动力，展开了宣传教育。组织七个文工队，五千多名的宣传大军，分到各工队，同吃同住同工作，进行宣传鼓动工作，针对思想情况，在工地展开整风，用大字报，大鸣大放大辩论，那里不通就到那里展开大鸣大放大辩论。如辩论为什么建设新村，为谁建设新村，依靠谁来建设新村，怎样才能做到多快好省地建设新村，能不能用旧材料自力更生的建设新村。
    三、大搞技术革新，改良工具。在工地开展“土洋”斗争，“快慢”斗争，“费省”斗争，“先进”与“落后”和“保守”思想斗争。通过大鸣大放大辩论，进行现场参观，算账对比，就地办红专学校，以师带徒的办法，开展人人搞试验，个个学技术，一人多艺，一人多技的多面手运动。做到三天学会，五天精通，七天毕业。这样培训出砌工、木工、烧石灰工、烧砖瓦工、油漆工、粉墙工等四千三百七十人。
    四、大搞试验房。先重点试验，取得经验全面推广。书记挂帅，从队书记起，都得搞试验房，有转业军人的“八一”试验房，有妇女的“三八”试验房，有书记的超师试验房，有无师试验房，许许多多种。同时展开节约运动，教育干部和群众，珍惜一砖一木，大材不小用，小材不浪费。
    五、关心群众的生活和安全。使群众吃的好，吃的饱，每人每月增加半斤油，共杀猪羊二千六百头，每三天加一次餐，工作有紧有闲，使群众睡的好，娱乐的好，始终使群众的精神饱满，出勤率达到百分之九十九以上。
    杨垱新村是在困难重重中建成的，从经过的各项措施来看，党的方针、政策、路线贯彻到每一个基层干部，每一个基层干部都学会运用党的和毛主席的领导方法和工作方法。各干部都掌握了马克思列宁主义理论，用到实际工作中去。更看到了劳动人民的无穷智慧和伟大的创造。我在杨垱受了一次向劳动人民学习的教育，上了一次理论结合实际课。
