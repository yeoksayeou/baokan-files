Comrade Representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I will resolutely implement them through practical actions. Now, I will give a brief report to the conference on the agricultural scientific experiments and research conducted by the Fenghuo Brigade of the Fenghuo People's Commune.

Deep plowing and careful cultivation, breeding new varieties, and increasing yield per unit area

Our agricultural scientific experiment began in 1952. At that time, the Party and the government called on farmers to improve agricultural techniques and increase yield per unit area. Our corn yield at that time was only 180 jin per mu. Such a low yield was really worrying. I couldn't sleep for several nights, pondering how to turn low yield into high yield. During the day, I discussed with young people Wang ZhengHai, old farmer Yao Shengzhi in the same group (at that time it was a mutual aid group), and found that the reasons for the low yield were: our corn varieties were not good, and the cultivation methods were rough, so the stalks did not grow large, the cobs were small, and the kernels were not full. At this time, we decided to work hard on seeds and cultivation. With the encouragement and support of the Party branch, we planted 1.7 mu of high-yield corn experimental fields. First, we changed the variety from "Jingyang Yellow" to "Red Heart Manya", and then carried out emasculation and cross-pollination. In terms of cultivation methods, we changed shallow plowing to deep plowing, changed flood irrigation to ditch irrigation, and also implemented phased fertilization and topdressing. After three years of experiments, we developed a set of relatively mature corn planting experience, which increased the corn yield per mu from the original 180 jin to more than 800 jin in 1952, more than 1300 jin in 1953, and more than 1500 jin in 1954, finally turning low yield into high yield. We also cultivated two new corn varieties, "1504" and "1506". By 1955, the "1506" seeds had been promoted in large areas, increasing production by more than 20%. The success of the corn high-yield experiment, the breeding of good varieties, and the fact that promotion in large areas increased production greatly changed the "atmosphere" in the village, and many people came to participate in the experiment and research. Wang Junying, an old man who originally did not believe in the experiment and called me "Wang the Madman", also changed his mind. When weighing in the corn field, he said: "I really didn't see through this group of young people." Old man Wang Youfu said:
  "Now the dynasty is different, and old eyes can't see people correctly." Some young people immediately said: "Yes, now it is the new society led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." With the leadership and support of the Party, and with several years of experience and the approval of the surrounding masses, we became more and more courageous and began to focus on wheat and cotton. In 1955, in order to solve the problem of land competition between grain and cotton in terms of planting area, we began to experiment with wheat and cotton double cropping on the same field, and began to carry out variety improvement experiments on wheat and cotton. After three years of effort, our wheat and cotton double cropping was finally successfully tested in 1957. In the 2.2 mu experimental field, a total of 2010 jin of wheat and 224 jin of ginned cotton were harvested, with an average yield of 957 jin of wheat and 102 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In 1958, wheat and cotton double cropping was promoted in a large area of 70 mu, and a bumper harvest was obtained, with an average yield of 450 jin of wheat and 97 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In these three years, we also cultivated two new cotton varieties, "Fengxuan No. 1" and "Fengxuan No. 3". At the same time, in the cultivation experiment, we created four new methods of wheat and cotton double cropping, including wheat and cotton intercropping, seedling transplanting, direct seeding of cotton seeds after barley harvest, and direct seeding of cotton seeds after wheat harvest, giving full play to the potential of the land. We carried out experiments on one hand, and promoted them on a large scale as soon as we succeeded. If new problems were found during the promotion, we would conduct experiments again. Through repeated experiments and large-scale promotion, the yields of corn, wheat and cotton in our team have increased year by year. The total output of grain alone has increased from more than 200,000 jin in 1952 to more than 830,000 jin in 1958. The average yield of cotton per mu increased from 45 jin in 1952 to more than 120 jin in 1958. This greatly increased the income of the whole team and improved the lives of the members. In 1958, the average income per person reached more than 140 yuan. The grain-deficient team has become a surplus-grain team. Of course, the more important reason for such a large increase in grain and cotton in our team is the leadership of the Party, the implementation of the Party's general line and various policies in rural areas, and the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, etc. However, I am mainly explaining here the role of our agricultural scientific experiments in increasing production.

Popularize experimental fields, conduct scientific research, and serve production better and more directly

Now, agricultural scientific experiments have become a common requirement and conscious activity of the members of our team. More than 70% of the members of the whole team have participated in this or that kind of experiment, with great enthusiasm and many creations. There are "Youth Experimental Fields", "Four Women's High-Yield Fields", "Old Man and Wife Experimental Fields", "Daughter-in-law and Girl Experimental Fields", "Couple Experimental Fields", and "Brother and Sister Experimental Fields". It is really like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own talents. The whole team has comprehensive experimental fields for various experiments (which are also demonstration bases for scientific research institutes). There are many plots divided here, including original variety observation fields, hybrid breeding fields, seed propagation fields; satellite experimental fields for finding large-scale high-yield ways, demonstration and education fields for conducting repeated experiments to resolve disputes, and competition experimental fields for creating high-yield records; There are also "omnipotent fields" that use the "three-three system" of gardening and light cultivation to overcome the ten major contradictions, and "dare to think fields". Whoever thinks of new problems and dares to create boldly can go to this field to experiment. The experimental projects are also varied, including variety improvement, fertilization, close planting, soil improvement, irrigation, plant protection, and field design, totaling 44 items.

The development of production, the widespread promotion of scientific experiments, the objective needs, and our own wishes all require us to raise our experimental research a step further. By the spring of last year, our brigade, with the kind care of the county party committee and the direct leadership of the township branch, established an agricultural science research institute, established an agricultural university, and opened professional courses in agricultural technology. This has further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for doing science. In particular, enthusiastic young men and women have almost all participated in cultural and technical studies. Everyone said: This time, our scientific experiments and research will definitely improve and develop faster.

Our experience has proved that it is completely correct to carry out mass agricultural scientific experiments. Carrying out mass agricultural scientific experiments has not reduced the "solemnity" of science, nor has it "vulgarized" or "simplified" science. On the contrary, it has given scientific experiments and research a broader mass base, which can be popularized, improved, and developed more quickly, and can better and more directly serve agricultural production.

In the past few years, we have made some creations and achieved some results in agricultural scientific experiments and research. However, we also deeply feel that it is indeed not easy to run the mass agricultural scientific research business well and truly play a role in promoting production. A lot of work needs to be done, and many issues need to be paid attention to. I would like to talk about the following points:

1. Agricultural scientific experiments must be closely combined with production and rely on the masses. At the beginning, our corn high-yield experiment was successful and quickly promoted among the masses. Everyone continued to do experiments, improving technology year by year and increasing production year by year. The cotton experiment was also the same. At the beginning, the "Four Women" cotton experimental field was well managed and grew tall, attracting old men, wives, daughters-in-law, and girls to do cotton experiments. The cotton cultivation technology was quickly and universally improved. For example, in 1955, our corn grew particularly well, but in the middle of the season, there was a mole cricket infestation. The corn seedlings that were bitten by the mole crickets quickly changed color and died. The actual production at that time raised the research topic of pest control and production protection for us. We initially used 666 powder for emergency prevention. However, spreading the powder on the ground did not work. We immediately convened a meeting to study. Someone said that he put the mole crickets into the powder bag, but the mole crickets still did not die, proving that although the medicine was strong, it still did not work if it did not get into the mole crickets' stomachs. After research, we came up with a method of mixing corn kernels with medicine to "lure the mole crickets to take the bait" for prevention. As a result, the big ones were poisoned to death, but the small ones were not, and the problem was not completely solved. At this time, we mobilized everyone to discuss again. After repeated experiments and research, we found that the reason was: too much medicine had a smell and the insects would not eat it, and too little medicine would not poison them to death. The corn kernels were too big and too hard for the small mole crickets to eat. We prescribed the right medicine and came up with an effective method, which was: the medicine must have a certain amount, the corn kernels must be small, plus some bran, and mixed with sesame oil so that the mole crickets feel soft and hard, the size is right, the oil is fragrant and delicious, they can't smell the medicine, and they especially love to eat it. This time it was very effective, and all the mole crickets died after the medicine was spread.

2. We must rely on the wisdom of the masses themselves, and also need the help of experts and scientific and technical personnel. At the same time, outdoor experiments must be combined with indoor research. Without relying on the masses, there would be no foundation, the experiment would not be easy to succeed, and it would be difficult to popularize and promote it. Without the help of experts and technicians, the improvement would be limited, and some more complex scientific and technical problems would be difficult to solve quickly. Facts have proved that the combination of the wisdom of the peasant masses and the knowledge of scientific and technical personnel will make the mass agricultural scientific experiments and research more effective. For example, regarding the problem of preventing corn lodging, we initially studied the method of building up the soil around the roots, but it did not work. Later, we adopted the method of setting up shelves, but the shelves were blown down by the wind again. After everyone's research, we adopted the method of ditching and sowing, but later found that the corn turned yellow. We thought it was lack of fertilizer, so we applied fertilizer, but it did not solve the problem. So, we discussed with Professor Su of Northwest Agricultural College. He asked us to take the soil for testing. After testing, it was found that there was more fertilizer on the surface and less fertilizer under the roots. He taught us a method, saying that we should ditch and apply water fertilizer. After applying water fertilizer, the corn grew green and strong, and none of them fell down, which solved the problem that we had not been able to solve well for several years. At the same time, according to our experience, we must also combine field experiments with indoor testing and research. For example, this year's wheat in our team grew very fast because of too much fertilizer and water, but early lodging occurred. In order to prevent wheat lodging, we applied potash fertilizer and sprinkled wood ash to the wheat. Some young people were very active and applied 10,000 jin per mu, but it was quickly discovered that the wheat with 1,000 jin applied lodged less, while the wheat with 10,000 jin applied lodged completely, and it did not prevent lodging. At this time, we conducted testing in the scientific research laboratory of the team and found that the 10,000 jin of wood ash contained too much potash fertilizer, which increased the acidity of the soil. After continuous testing and actual experiments in the wheat field, we came to a scientific conclusion of "three, two, two" ratio, that is, the fertilizer composition should contain 30% nitrogen, 20% phosphorus, and 20% potassium. We have applied the fertilizer prepared according to this ratio to satellite fields and large-scale high-yield fields, and the effect is very good. According to a letter from the team yesterday, it has basically prevented wheat lodging.

3. We must resolutely obey and rely on the leadership of the Party, implement political command, and constantly struggle against backward ideas. This is a key issue related to whether the work can be carried out smoothly and whether significant achievements can be made. In the struggle between advanced ideas and backward ideas, it includes not only the struggle against backward ideas among the masses, but also the struggle against the backward side of one's own thoughts. In 1952, when we started the corn high-yield experiment and proposed to achieve a yield of 1,200 jin per mu, some people thought we were "messing around" and it was impossible to do it, calling me "Wang the Madman," "1,200," and saying, "If you don't get 1,200, the government will ask you to compensate." In this case, I felt very uneasy, so I asked the Party for instructions. The Party branch secretary gave me clear instructions, saying, "This is a struggle between advanced and backward, we must persevere to the end, set an example, and convince people with facts." The Party's instructions gave us great encouragement and strengthened our confidence. After three years, we finally achieved a corn yield of 1,500 jin per mu in 1954, which exceeded the original plan of 1,200 jin by 300 jin. Because of the success of this experiment, we were praised by the Party and government and praised by the masses. At this time, I neglected that the main credit for these achievements was due to the leadership of the Party and everyone's efforts. Instead, I thought I was great, and my head was full of leaders shaking hands and reporters taking pictures, and I became a little proud. The masses gossiped behind my back and satirized me in person, calling me "a provincial cadre" and saying, "I am too great to respect." I was isolated from the masses. What to do? I went to the branch leader again. The Party gave me patient help and education, criticized my shortcomings, pointed out the direction for continued progress, and asked us to experiment with two crops of wheat and corn, double cropping of wheat and cotton, and continue to think of ways to increase production. We were following the Party's instructions and were making progress. Just as we were experimenting with a trick, some people said: Your method is not the direction of the agricultural cooperative. When we were thinking of cleaning up and retreating, the Party gave us strength again, encouraging us to say: "The direction is good, continue to do it," and dispatched special scientific personnel to help specifically. As a result, our experiment was successful and achieved greater results.

We resolutely support the various measures taken by the government to quell the rebellion in Tibet

Our achievements have been achieved under the leadership and kind care of the Party and the government. We must guard against arrogance and rashness and continue to move forward. We deeply understand that only today, in the socialist motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, can our workers and peasants conduct scientific and technological experiments and research. And constantly achieve new achievements. We working people, we young people of this generation, wholeheartedly support the great Communist Party of China and our beloved Chairman Mao, and love our great socialist motherland from the bottom of our hearts. However, the imperialists do not like our victory and are plotting day and night to undermine the construction and unity of our motherland. The recent rebellion in Tibet was carried out under the conspiracy and support of British imperialism and Indian interventionists. They colluded with and supported the original Tibetan local government and reactionary groups in an attempt to preserve the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system in Tibet, and undermine the national unity and unity of our motherland. The Indian expansionists verbally stated that they would not interfere in China's internal affairs and would continue to consolidate Sino-Indian friendship, but in fact they were carrying out conspiracies to undermine the Five Principles and Sino-Indian friendly relations, expressing great "enthusiasm" and "sympathy" for the rebellion of the upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet, and distributing the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" through Indian diplomatic officials, trying to separate Tibet from the big family of all ethnic groups in our country and engage in so-called Tibetan "independence." We are extremely angry at these conspiracies of imperialists and Indian interventionists and resolutely oppose any foreign reactionaries interfering in our country's internal affairs. We resolutely support our government's order to dissolve the original Tibetan local government and the various measures taken in quelling the rebellion in Tibet. Now the rebellion in Tibet has been basically quelled, and the Tibetan people are firmly united with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, they are fighting to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet. Let the foreign invaders and rebels clamor and cry! It is they themselves who will be unlucky, and victory belongs to our great Chinese people.

Please criticize and correct any inaccuracies in the above statement.

### 研究农业科学变低产为高产

专栏：

    研究农业科学变低产为高产
    王保京代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，拥护李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。并要在实际行动上坚决贯彻执行。现在，我把我们峰火人民公社峰火大队开展农业科学试验和科学研究的情况，向大会作个简单的汇报。
    深耕细作，培育新品种，提高单位面积产量
    我们的农业科学试验是从一九五二年开始的。那时候，党和政府号召农民改进农业作务技术，提高单位面积产量。而我们的玉米当时的亩产量只是一百八十斤。这样低的产量，真使人着急，有好几个晚上我没有睡着觉，心里盘算着，怎样才能把低产变高产。白天就和同组的（当时是互助组）青年王正海、老农姚生枝一块研究，找出低产的原因是：我们的玉米品种不好，耕作的方法粗糙，所以秆子长的不大，结的棒子小，颗粒不饱。这时，我们就决心从种子和作务上下功夫，在党支部的鼓励和支持下，我们种了一亩七分玉米高产试验田。先改换了品种，“泾阳黄”改为“红心马牙”，又进行了去雄杂交授粉。在耕作方法上，改浅耕为深耕，改大水漫灌为沟灌，还实行了分期施肥和施追肥。经过三年的试验，搞出了一套比较成熟的玉米种植经验，把玉米的亩产量由原来的一百八十斤，提高到一九五二年的八百多斤，一九五三年的一千三百多斤，一九五四年的一千五百多斤，终于把低产变成了高产。还培育出“1504”、“1506”号两个玉米新品种，到一九五五年，“1506”号种子已在大面积田块上推广了，增产百分之二十以上。玉米高产试验的成功，良种培育，在大面积上推广增产的事实，把村子里的“空气”大大的改变了，很多人都来参加试验和研究。原来不相信试验，把我叫“王疯子”的王俊英老汉认识也改变了。在玉米场里过秤的时候，他说：“把这一伙青年娃真没看出。”王有福老汉说：
  “现在朝代不同了，老眼光看人不行了。”一些青年人紧接着说：“对，现在是共产党、毛主席领导的新社会。”有党的领导和支持，又有了几年的经验和周围群众的赞成，我们的胆子越来越大了，又开始给小麦和棉花打主意。一九五五年，为了解决粮食和棉花在播种面积上的争地问题，我们开始了在同一田块上进行麦棉两熟的试验，并开始对麦子和棉花的品种进行改良试验。经过三年的努力，到一九五七年我们的麦棉两熟终于试验成功了。在二亩二分的试验田里，共收小麦二千零十斤，皮棉二百二十四斤，平均亩产小麦九百五十七斤，皮棉一百零二斤。到一九五八年，麦棉两熟就在七十亩的大面积上推广了，并获得了丰收，平均亩产麦子四百五十斤，皮棉九十七斤。在这三年里，我们还培育出“烽选一号”“烽选三号”两个新棉种。同时，在耕作试验上，创造出麦棉套种、育苗移栽，大麦收后直播棉子和小麦收后直播棉子的四种麦棉两熟的新方法，充分利用和发挥了土地的潜力。我们一面进行试验，一有成功，一面就大面积推广。推广中一发现新的问题，就又进行试验。经过反复试验和大面积的推广，使我队的玉米、小麦和棉花的产量，一年比一年增加，仅粮食一项的总产量，就由一九五二年的二十多万斤，增加到一九五八年的八十三万多斤。棉花的每亩平均产量由一九五二年的四十五斤上升到一九五八年的一百二十多斤。这就大大增加了全队的收入和改善提高了社员的生活。一九五八年每个人平均收入达到一百四十多元。由缺粮队变成了余粮队。当然，我们队里粮食、棉花这样大的增产，更重要的原因是由于党的领导，是由于我们执行了党的总路线和党在农村的各项政策，执行了农业增产的“八字宪法”等。不过，我这里主要是在说明我们开展农业科学试验对增产所起的作用。
    普种试验田，进行科学研究，更好更直接地为生产服务
    现在，农业科学试验在我们队里已经成了社员的普遍要求和自觉活动。全队百分之七十以上的社员都参加了这样或那样的试验，钻劲很大，创造很多。有“青年试验田”，有“四女丰产田”，有“老汉老婆试验田”，有“媳妇姑娘试验田”，有“夫妻试验田”，也有“兄妹试验田”，真是八仙过海，各显其能。在全队有进行各种试验的综合试验田（也是科学研究室的示范基地），这里边划了很多块，有原始品种观察田、杂交育种田，种子繁殖田；有寻找大面积丰产途径的卫星试验田，有进行重复试验，解决争论的示范教育田，也有创造高额丰产纪录的竞赛试验田；有三三制田园化轻作套种克服十大矛盾的万能田，还有“敢想田”，谁想到新的问题，谁敢大胆创造，就到这块田里去试验。试验的项目也是五花八门，样样都有，如改良品种、施肥、密植、土壤改良、灌溉、植物保护以及田间设计等共有四十四项。
    生产的发展，科学试验的普遍推广，客观的需要和我们自己的愿望，都要求把我们的试验研究提高一步。到去年春季，我们大队在县委的亲切关怀和乡支部的直接领导下，成立了农业科学研究室，办起了农业大学，开了农业技术的专业课程。这就更加鼓舞了大家办科学的积极性。特别是热心的男女青年们，几乎全部都参加了文化和技术学习。大家都说：这一下，咱们的科学试验和研究一定会更快的提高和发展。
    我们的经验，证明了开展群众性的农业科学试验是完全正确的。开展群众性的农业科学试验，并没有降低科学的“庄严性”，更不是把科学“庸俗化”了，“简单化”了，恰恰是使科学试验和研究有了更加广泛的群众基础，能够更快的普及，提高和发展，能够更好更直接的为农业生产服务。
    这几年来，我们在农业科学试验和研究方面，是有一些创造，取得了一些成绩。可是我们也深深地感到，要把群众性的农业科学研究事业办好，真正起到推动生产的作用，确实不简单。要做很多工作，要注意很多问题。我在这里想谈以下几点体会：
    一、农业科学试验要密切的结合生产和依靠群众。开头我们的玉米高产试验成功，很快的就在群众中推广，大家继续搞试验，年年提高技术，年年增产。棉花的试验也是这样，开头搞的“四女”棉花试验田，务的好，长得高，惹的老汉、老婆、媳妇、姑娘都搞棉花试验，棉花的作务技术很快的普遍提高了。又如一九五五年我们的玉米长的特别好，可是中途发生了蛐蛐虫害，凡是被蛐蛐咬了的玉米苗，很快就变色死掉，当时的生产实际给我们提出了防虫保产试验的研究课题，我们起先用666粉试行紧急防治。可是把药粉撒到地里却不顶事，立即就召集大家开会研究，有人说他把蛐蛐放进药粉袋子，蛐蛐还是不死，证明药力虽大，吃不到蛐蛐肚子，还是顶不了事，经过研究想出了用玉米糁子拌药，“勾引蛐蛐上钩”的办法防治。结果毒死了大的没有毒死小的，还没有彻底解决问题。这时再发动大家讨论，经过反复的试验研究，结果找到了原因是：药多了有气味虫不吃，药少了毒不死，玉米糁子太大、太硬小蛐蛐吃不进去。我们对症下药，提出了有效的办法，这就是：药要有分量，玉米糁子要小，再加上一些麸皮，还要搅拌香油，使蛐蛐觉得有软有硬，大小合适，油香可口，嗅不到药味，特别爱吃，这一次灵得很，撒药后蛐蛐全部死掉，一扫而光。
    二、既要依靠群众自己的智慧，也需要专家和科学技术人员的帮助。同时，室外的试验要和室内的研究结合。不依靠群众，就没有基础，试验不易成功，更难以普及推广。没有专家和技术人员的帮助，提高会受到限制，有些较复杂的科学技术问题，难于很快解决。事实证明，农民群众的智慧和科学技术人员的知识结合起来，会使群众的农业科学试验，研究收效更大。譬如，关于防止玉米倒伏的问题，我们开始时研究采取根部培土的办法，没有顶事。后来又采取搭架的办法，结果架又被风吹倒了。经过大家研究，又采取开沟播种的办法，可是以后发现玉米发黄，我们以为是缺肥，就给上肥料，但也不解决问题。于是，我们就同西北农学院的苏教授研究，他叫我们把土壤拿去化验，经过化验，发现是表面肥多，根下肥少，他给我们教办法说要开沟施水肥。在施了水肥以后，果然玉米长的又绿又壮，一个也没有倒，一下解决了我们几年没有很好彻底解决的问题。同时，根据我们的经验，还要把田间的试验和室内的化验研究结合起来。例如：今年我们队里的小麦，因为肥大、水多、长的特别快，可是早期就发生倒伏现象，我们为了防止麦子倒伏，给麦子施钾肥，撒草木灰等，有些青年人积极的很，给一亩地上一万斤，可是很快就发现上一千斤的，麦子倒伏的少，而上一万斤的，麦子却全部倒了，没有防住。这时我们就在队里的科学研究室进行化验，发现上一万斤草木灰的，是钾肥太多了，使土壤增加了酸性。经过继续的化验和在麦田里的实际试验，得出了“三、二、二”比例的科学结论，即肥料成分应含三成氮、二成磷、二成钾。我们已把按这个比例配成的肥料，给卫星田和大面积丰产田都上了，效果很好，据昨天队里给我来信说，基本上防止了麦子倒伏。
    三、要坚决服从和依靠党的领导，实行政治挂帅，不断与落后思想作斗争。这是一个关系到工作能不能顺利开展，能不能做出显著成绩的关键问题。在先进思想与落后思想的斗争中，既包括同群众中落后思想的斗争，也包括同自己思想上落后的一面的斗争。在一九五二年，我们开始搞玉米高产试验的时候，提出亩产要达到一千二百斤，当时有人认为我们是“胡闹哩”，根本办不到，把我叫“王疯子”，“一千二”，并说：“你们搞不到一千二，政府要叫你们赔哩”。在这种情况下，弄得自己思想很不安，于是就向党去请示。党支书给了我明确的指示，说“这是先进与落后的斗争，一定要坚持到底，做出样子，用事实说服人”。党的指示给了我们很大的鼓舞，坚定了我们的信心，搞了三年，到底在一九五四年玉米亩产达到了一千五百斤，比原计划的一千二百斤还超过了三百斤。因为这次试验的成功，我们受到了党政的表扬和群众的称赞。这时候，我却忽视了这些成绩的获得，主要是党的领导和大家的功劳，而却认为自己了不起，满脑子里的首长握手，记者照像，有点骄傲起来。群众背后议论，当面讽刺，把我叫“省上干部”，说：“神大了敬不下了”，把自己在群众中孤立起来了。怎么办呢？我又去找支部领导同志，党给了我耐心的帮助和教育，批评了缺点，指出了继续前进的方向，要我们试验小麦玉米两作复种，麦棉两熟，继续多想增产门路。我们遵循着党的指示正在进行，刚试验出个名堂，却有些人说：你们这搞法不是农业社的方向，说得我们正想收拾摊子打退堂鼓的时候，党又给了我们力量，鼓励我们说：“方向不错，继续大搞”，并调派专门的科学人员具体帮助，结果我们的试验成功了，取得了更大的成绩。
    我们坚决拥护政府平定西藏叛乱所采取的各项措施
    我们的成绩，是在党和政府的领导和亲切关怀下取得的。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，继续前进。我们深深的懂得，只有在今天，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的社会主义祖国，我们工人农民自己才能够去进行科学技术的试验和研究。并且不断的获得新的成就。我们劳动人民，我们这一代的青年，衷心的拥护伟大的中国共产党和我们敬爱的毛主席，从心底里热爱我们伟大的社会主义祖国，可是帝国主义，却不喜欢我们的胜利，日夜盘算着破坏我们祖国的建设和统一。最近西藏的叛乱事件，就是在英帝国主义和印度干涉者的阴谋活动和支持下进行的。他们勾结和支持原西藏地方政府和反动集团，企图保存西藏的落后、黑暗、反动、残酷的农奴制度，破坏我们祖国的民族团结和统一，印度的扩张主义分子，口头上表示不干涉中国内政，要继续巩固中印友谊，但他们实际上却在干着破坏五项原则和中印友好关系的阴谋活动，对西藏上层反动分子的叛乱表示很大的“热心”和“同情”，并且由印度的外交官员散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，想把西藏从我国各民族的大家庭中分裂出去，搞所谓西藏“独立”。对帝国主义和印度干涉者的这些阴谋活动，我们极端愤怒，坚决反对任何外国反动派干涉我国的内政。我们坚决拥护我国政府关于解散原西藏地方政府的命令和在平息西藏叛乱中所采取的各项措施。现在西藏的叛乱已经基本平定，西藏人民正在坚定地同全国各族人民团结一致，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。让外国侵略者和叛乱分子去叫嚣和哭泣吧！倒霉的是他们自己，胜利是属于我们伟大的中国人民的。
    以上发言，如有不对的地方，请批评指正。
