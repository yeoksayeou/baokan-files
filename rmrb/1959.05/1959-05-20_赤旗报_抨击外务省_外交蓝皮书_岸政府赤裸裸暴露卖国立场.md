Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th. The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published a commentary today criticizing the "Diplomatic Blue Book" released by the Kishi Nobusuke government's Foreign Ministry on the 16th. The commentary pointed out that this document affirms the Kishi Nobusuke government's subservient foreign policy towards the United States and is filled with blatant anti-Soviet and anti-China rhetoric.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's "Diplomatic Blue Book" analyzed the international situation in 1958. It concludes by refusing to allow Japan to adopt a neutral stance and reiterates that "strengthening self-defense capabilities and establishing the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system are the basic lines of (Japan's) diplomacy."

The "Red Flag" commentary pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Diplomatic Blue Book" is attempting to legitimize its conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and negate the path of neutrality for Japan, thereby nakedly exposing its traitorous stance.

"Red Flag" pointed out that the "three diplomatic principles" (namely: centering on the United Nations; cooperating with free countries; and adhering to the position of Asian member) that the Kishi Nobusuke government has consistently used as a signboard in recent years are not mentioned at all in this blue book. This is because the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of a blatant policy of hostility towards China and its conspiracy to establish a military alliance aimed at aggression against China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries has caused this so-called "three diplomatic principles" to increasingly lose the trust of Asian countries.

The commentary refuted the Kishi Nobusuke government's shameless claim in the "Diplomatic Blue Book" that the Japanese government "in order to ensure world peace," "avoided any words or deeds that interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or stimulate national sentiment." In this regard, the commentary specifically mentioned the fact that Kishi Nobusuke himself went to Taiwan to encourage Chiang Kai-shek to "counterattack the mainland," interfering in China's internal affairs and antagonizing the Chinese people.

"Red Flag" pointed out that this "Diplomatic Blue Book" also distorts the facts, saying that the Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted a "friendly relationship" stance when talking about Japan-China relations. The commentary pointed out that this statement by the Kishi Nobusuke government is an attempt to shift the responsibility for the stalemate in Japan-China relations onto China and portray itself as a government that implements an independent foreign policy of peaceful coexistence, in order to deceive the Japanese people.

    “赤旗报”抨击外务省“外交蓝皮书”
    岸政府赤裸裸暴露卖国立场
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表评论，抨击岸信介政府外务省在16日发表的“外交蓝皮书”。评论指出，这个文件肯定岸信介政府的屈从美国的外交政策，并且充满露骨敌视苏联和中国的论调。
    岸信介政府的“外交蓝皮书”分析了1958年的国际形势。它在最后表示拒绝使日本采取中立的立场，并且重申“加强自卫力量和建立日美安全保障体系是（日本）外交的基本路线”。
    “赤旗报”的评论指出，岸信介政府的这项“外交蓝皮书”是在企图使它修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋合法化，并且否定使日本走中立的道路，从而赤裸裸地暴露出它的卖国立场。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介政府几年来一向用来当做招牌的“外交三原则”（即：以联合国为中心；同自由国家合作；坚持亚洲成员的立场）在这项蓝皮书中却只字未提，这是因为岸信介政府执行露骨的敌视中国和阴谋建立以侵略中苏和亚洲各国为目的的军事同盟的政策，使这个所谓“外交三原则”越来越失去亚洲各国的信任。
    评论驳斥了岸信介政府在这项“外交蓝皮书”中厚颜无耻地提出的所谓日本政府“为了确保世界和平”，“避免了任何干涉他国内政和刺激国民感情的言行”的虚伪说法。在这方面，评论特别提到岸信介本人就曾经到台湾去鼓励蒋介石“反攻大陆”的干涉中国内政和同中国人民为敌的事实。
      “赤旗报”指出，这项“外交蓝皮书”还歪曲事实，在谈到日中关系时说什么岸信介政府采取了“建立友好关系”的立场。评论指出，岸信介政府的这种说法是企图把日中关系陷入僵局的责任推到中国身上，把自己打扮成一个实行独立的和平共处外交政策的政府，来欺骗日本人民。
