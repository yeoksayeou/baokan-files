    Two Recent Poems After Visiting Moscow
    Guo Moruo
      At the Ceremony in the Kremlin Awarding Comrade Khrushchev
          the Lenin International Peace Prize
      The peace conference brings good news, and the prize is presented to this great man.
      No interference is allowed in internal affairs; diplomacy now follows a compass.
      Marxism-Leninism is universally applicable, while the U.S. and Britain harbor many ulterior motives.
      Man-made satellites revolve in the sky, and the new sun brightly breaks through the gloom.
      Visiting the Yusupov Museum
    The museum is located in the suburbs of Moscow, formerly the mansion of Duke Yusupov. The gardens are beautiful, and there are many works of art, including a huge oil painting depicting the story of the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra. The poet Pushkin often visited here during his lifetime. There is a bust in the forest, and in front of the statue are bunches of wildflowers, offered by visitors.
      The dense forest still carries its charm, and I revisit with pleasure after two years.
      The spring scenery in this scenic spot is delayed by many months, while that beauty is separated by the distant sky.
      The fragrant grass in the garden forms a green carpet, and the beauty of the princess on the wall is exquisite.
      Admiration for the poet's legacy remains; several bunches of wildflowers are offered before the statue.

    访莫斯科近作二首
    郭沫若
      在克里姆林宫授予赫鲁晓夫同志
          列宁国际和平奖金会上
      和平会议有佳音，又为斯人献奖金。
      内政不容干涉者，外交今据指南针。
      马列四海放皆准，英美多端蓄异心。
      人造行星天上转，新阳杲杲破沉阴。
      游攸苏坡夫博物馆
    博物馆在莫斯科郊外，本攸苏坡夫公爵旧邸。园林甚好，美术品颇多，有巨幅油画表现埃及女王克略拍特拉故事。诗人普希金生前常来此作客，林中有胸像，像前有野花成束，乃游人所献。
      森森林木韵依然，乘兴重游已二年。
      胜地春光迟累月，伊人秋水隔遥天。
      园中芳草茵敷碧，壁上王姬黛门妍。
      景慕诗人遗爱在，野花数束献台前。
