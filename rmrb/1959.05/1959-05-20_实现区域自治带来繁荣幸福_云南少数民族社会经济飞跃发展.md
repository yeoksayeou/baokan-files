Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 19th: (By our correspondent Tian Lianggen) After the minority nationalities in Yunnan Province achieved regional autonomy within the big family of the motherland, their social economy has experienced rapid development.

    Yunnan has about six million minority people belonging to twenty-one major nationalities and sixty ethnic branches. Some have relatively concentrated settlements, while others are scattered in counties and cities throughout the province. Before liberation, the social and economic development of various minority nationalities was extremely unbalanced. The four million minority people in the interior had entered feudal society, while the two million minority people in the border areas were still in the early feudal or even more primitive and backward stages. From 1953, Yunnan Province began to implement ethnic regional autonomy in a planned way. Through various tasks, the Party's ethnic policies were implemented, ethnic unity was strengthened, and a group of ethnic cadres were trained. Then, after consultation with upper-class minority figures and full discussion by the people, ethnic autonomous areas were established. Now, ethnic minority areas in the province have basically achieved ethnic regional autonomy, establishing eight autonomous prefectures and eleven autonomous counties. These areas account for about 70% of the province's total minority population. The four million minority people in the interior, together with the Han people, completed land reform and socialist transformation, and achieved people's communes in 1958. The minority nationalities in the border areas are transitioning to socialism in different ways, based on the characteristics of their respective national development. From 1955, the areas inhabited by the Dai, Hani, Lahu, Tibetan, Yi, and other ethnic groups, with a population of 1.7 million, have successively adopted peaceful negotiation to carry out land reform, abolish feudal privileges, usury, and rent exploitation. Immediately afterward, the autonomous areas launched a mutual aid and cooperation movement, basically achieving agricultural collectivization. Some areas have also piloted people's communes. In the areas inhabited by the Jingpo, Kawa, Lisu, and other ethnic groups, with a population of approximately 600,000, where class differentiation is not yet obvious, agricultural cooperatives have been widely established and people's communes have been piloted, gradually transitioning directly to socialism.
    During the Great Leap Forward last year, industrial and agricultural production in various ethnic autonomous areas developed vigorously. In the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, located in the Gaoligong and Biluo Snow Mountains, paddy fields have expanded from more than 39,000 mu in 1957 to 120,000 mu. The new irrigation canals built last year were equivalent to ten times the total amount of water conservancy projects built in the past several hundred years. In the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, two or three years ago, more than 70% of the farmers in the prefecture did not even have enough food for three months. After the democratic reform last year, the average grain possession per person per year reached more than 760 jin. Many minority nationalities with only a few thousand people on the verge of extinction before liberation have gained new life under the care of the Party and autonomous areas. The Kucong people, who used to wander and hunt in the primitive forests all year round, have settled down and are living and working in peace. The border ethnic autonomous areas, which originally practiced slash-and-burn cultivation and where handicrafts had not yet been separated from agriculture, have new industries, ending the history of their nationalities without industry. There are already hundreds of steel, machinery manufacturing, agricultural tool, sugar, paper, winery, power plant, and other factories in the Yunnan border areas. Other cultural, educational, health, transportation, and other undertakings have greatly developed, and the poor and backward conditions of the border minority nationalities have changed significantly.
    The strong assistance of the Party and the state to the ethnic autonomous areas is an important condition for the rapid development of the local minority nationalities. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state invested more than 50 million yuan to help minority nationalities develop production and improve their lives. The state bank also issued more than 15 million yuan in low-interest loans in the border areas. The Party has also sent more than 10,000 outside cadres to Yunnan to help the minority nationalities build the border areas. (Attached picture)

### 实现区域自治带来繁荣幸福  云南少数民族社会经济飞跃发展

    实现区域自治带来繁荣幸福
    云南少数民族社会经济飞跃发展
    据新华社昆明19日电　本社记者田良耕报道：云南省少数民族在祖国大家庭内实现了民族区域自治之后，社会经济有了飞跃发展。
    云南境内少数民族共约六百万人，分属于二十一个主要民族和六十个民族支系，一部分有比较集中的聚居区，一部分杂居在全省各县市。解放前，各个少数民族社会经济发展极不平衡，内地四百万少数民族已进入封建社会，边疆二百多万少数民族尚处于封建初期或更原始落后的阶段。从1953年起，云南省便有计划地开始推行民族区域自治。通过各项工作，贯彻了党的民族政策，加强了民族团结，培养了一批民族干部，然后经过和少数民族上层人士协商，人民群众的充分讨论，建立了民族自治地方。现在，全省少数民族聚居地区已基本上实现民族区域自治，共建立了八个自治州和十一个自治县。这些地区的少数民族，约占全省少数民族总人口的70％。内地的四百万少数民族和汉族一道完成了土地改革和社会主义改造，并且于1958年实现了人民公社化。边疆地区的少数民族，是依据各个民族发展的特点，采取了不同的方式向社会主义过渡。从1955年起，一百七十万人口的傣、哈尼、拉祜、藏、彝等民族地区，先后采取和平协商的方式进行土地改革，废除了封建特权、高利贷、地租等剥削。紧接着，各自治地方开展了互助合作运动，基本上实现了农业合作化，有的地区已试办人民公社。在阶级分化尚不明显的景颇、佧佤、傈僳等民族约六十万人口地区，现在已普遍建立农业社和试办了人民公社，逐步地直接向社会主义过渡。
    在去年大跃进中，各民族自治地方的工农业生产都蓬勃发展。处在高黎贡山和碧罗雪山中的怒江傈僳族自治州，水田由1957年的三万九千多亩扩展到十二万亩，去年一年新辟的水渠相当于过去几百年来兴修水利总和的十倍。迪庆藏族自治州两三年前，全州70％以上农民连三个月口粮也没有，去年实现民主改革后达到了每人每年平均有粮食七百六十多斤。许多解放前濒于灭亡边缘的只有几千人口的少数民族，在党和自治地方的关怀下，获得新生。终年在原始森林中漂泊不定游猎为生的苦聪人已经安居乐业。原是刀耕火种，手工业尚末从农业中分离出来的边疆民族自治地方，都有了新兴的工业，结束了本民族没有工业的历史。云南边疆已有数百座钢铁、机械制造、农具、制糖、造纸、酿酒、电厂等工厂。其他文教、卫生、交通等事业都有很大发展，边疆少数民族贫困落后的面貌已有显著的改变。
    各民族自治地方都得到党和国家的大力帮助，这是当地少数民族能飞跃发展的重要条件。在第一个五年计划期间，国家用于帮助少数民族发展生产、改善生活的经费，达五千多万元。国家银行还在边疆发放了一千五百多万元的低利贷款。党还派出一万多名外来干部到云南帮助少数民族建设边疆。（附图片）
