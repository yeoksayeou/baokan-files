The First Ministry of Machine Building Demands Strict Implementation of Inspection Systems
    Striving for Every Product to Meet Standards
    (Our Dispatch) The First Ministry of Machine Building recently issued instructions on rapidly improving product quality, calling on employees of the national machinery industry to strive for every product leaving the factory to meet national standards.
    The instructions state that since the Great Leap Forward, the labor productivity of the machinery industry has increased rapidly, and the variety of products has increased. However, it should not be ignored that the quality of some mechanical products has not fully reached the required level, and some old products have also experienced a decline in quality. The basic reason is that necessary measures have not been taken to ensure the comprehensive improvement of product quality.
    The quality of machinery industry products has an extremely profound impact on the entire national economic construction undertaking. This year, China's machinery industry has even heavier tasks, and many products are required more urgently. Every enterprise must not only ensure the rapid growth of output and variety and the reduction of product costs, but also ensure the further improvement of product quality, and achieve a comprehensive leap forward. It must be clearly recognized that only when product quality is guaranteed can the rapid growth of output and variety be realized, otherwise it will inevitably lead to waste.
    The instructions emphasize: In mass production movements, leaders must not only study measures to improve unit output, but also study measures to improve and ensure product quality, and resolutely correct the one-sided view of opposing output and quality. On the basis of mass movements, combined with mass participation in management, the technical management of enterprises must be quickly rectified and strengthened. The work of improving product quality must be listed as a major topic of technical revolution.
    In order to ensure quality, the First Ministry of Machine Building requires all enterprises to take the following measures:
    First, strengthen ideological education, clearly recognize the serious harm of poor product quality, thereby establishing a comprehensive leap forward view of high output and high quality, and launch mass quality inspection and evaluation movements. Commend advanced individuals with high output and high quality, and through this movement determine the current production quality indicators, and launch a mass high output and high quality competition.
    Second, establish process discipline and formulate necessary systems to ensure product quality. The modification of technical conditions and quality standards for products should fully consider the opinions of users. Modifications involving national standards and industrial standards should be carried out after approval by the corresponding higher-level authorities.
    Third, strengthen technical inspection and technical support work. Technical inspection agencies must be rectified and strengthened, correcting the attitude of simply "guarding the gate" or standing by. The workers' self-inspection and the work of full-time inspectors must be combined, and necessary routine work such as waste product statistics and quality analysis must be restored.
    Fourth, focus on the key to product quality, carry out technical revolutions in depth, and further improve the level of production technology. The spearhead of technical innovation and technical revolution should be directed towards both the quality and quantity of products.

### 一机部要求严格执行检验制度  力争每件产品都合标准

    一机部要求严格执行检验制度
    力争每件产品都合标准
    本报讯  第一机械工业部于最近发出了迅速提高产品质量的指示，号召全国机械工业的职工，努力争取每一件出厂产品都符合国家规定的标准。
    指示认为，大跃进以来，机械工业的劳动生产率迅速地增长了，产品品种增多了。可是，也不应该忽视，有些机械产品的质量还没完全达到应有的水平，部分老产品也发生过质量下降的现象。基本的原因在于没有采取必要的措施来保证产品质量的全面提高。
    机械工业产品质量的好坏，对整个国民经济建设事业具有极其深远的影响。今年我国机械工业的任务更重，有很多产品要求更急，每一个企业都必须既保证产量、品种的迅速增长和产品成本的降低，又保证产品质量的进一步提高，实现全面跃进。必须明确认识，只有在产品质量得到保证的条件下，才能实现产量和品种的迅速增长，否则势必造成浪费。
    指示强调：在群众生产运动中，领导上既要研究如何提高单位产量的措施，也要研究如何提高和保证产品质量的措施，坚决纠正把产量和质量对立起来的片面观点。必须在群众运动的基础上，结合群众参加管理，迅速整顿和加强企业的技术管理工作。必须把提高产品质量的工作，列为技术革命的一个主要课题。
    为了保证质量，一机部要求各企业采取以下措施：
    第一、加强思想教育，明确认识产品质量低劣的严重危害性，从而树立高产高质的全面跃进观点，开展群众性的质量检查和评比运动。表扬高产高质的先进人物，并通过这一运动确定当前生产的质量指标，掀起群众性的高产高质竞赛。
    第二、树立工艺纪律，制订保证产品质量的必要制度。产品的技术条件与质量标准的修改，应充分考虑用户的意见。涉及国家标准及事业标准的，应经相应的上级机关批准后进行。
    第三、加强技术检查和技术后方的工作。必须整顿和加强技术检查机构，纠正单纯“把关”或袖手旁观的态度，把工人的自检和专职检查工作结合起来，并恢复废品统计和质量分析等必要的经常性工作。
    第四、针对产品质量的关键，深入开展技术革命，进一步提高生产技术水平。技术革新和技术革命的矛头，应指向产品的质量和产量两个方面。
