Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

The reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Comrades Peng Zhen and Li Weihan summarized the glorious achievements of our country's economic construction in all aspects in 1958 and put forward the grand plan for 1959. I cannot help but be delighted and inspired. Although I spoke at the group meeting last time, I still cannot fully express my excitement and joy. Now I will add some of my insights.

During this inspection, I was deeply moved by the prosperous outlook of the motherland and the overall Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, education, and cultural undertakings. As we all know, China was a country with very backward industry and agriculture. In the short period of more than nine years since liberation, not only have we established a foundation for both light and heavy industries, but we can also manufacture airplanes, automobiles, ships, precision machinery, etc. Agriculture has also achieved bumper harvests due to measures such as improving soil quality, building water conservancy projects, and deep plowing and careful cultivation. People's lives have been greatly improved, and they have been freed from the miserable situation of hunger and cold, and are now living a happy and prosperous life. At the same time, our international status has also changed from a poor and weak country that was at the mercy of imperialist bullying to a first-class power in the world. All of these situations show the new atmosphere of prosperity, strength, and prosperity in our country. Why have we been able to achieve such great achievements in such a short period of less than ten years? This is due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and embarking on the road of building socialism. Under the education of the Party, the people of the whole country have achieved unprecedented unity and brought into play their enthusiasm for production and soaring energy. From this, we can conclude that only by loyally and honestly accepting the leadership of the Party and adhering to the road of socialism can we have a bright and happy future.

This time, I also inspected the Hongxing, Sijiqing, and Shisanling People's Communes. The saying "Communism is paradise, and the people's commune is the bridge" is widely circulated among the people. During the inspection, I deeply realized the correctness of these two sentences. Since the establishment of the commune, the implementation of the half-supply system and the half-wage system has solved the living problems of farmers such as food and clothing. Therefore, they are in a happy mood, challenge competitions happily in labor, and their production enthusiasm is very high. In particular, due to the unified allocation and rational utilization of manpower and material resources by the commune, the strength of manpower and material resources can be well brought into play, thereby enabling crops to be abundant. From this, it can be seen that the people's commune is an organization that conforms to the greatest wishes and interests of the people, that is to say, only through the organizational form of the people's commune can the people move towards a happy and brilliant communist society. However, because the people's commune fully demonstrated its superiority, it aroused the hostility of imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements, who tried their best to attack and slander it. At home, some muddle-headed gentlemen (perhaps with ulterior motives), seeing the individual shortcomings of the commune, amplified them and echoed the imperialist clamor, saying that the commune had deviations and was not established, etc. This is wrong. The people's commune has just been founded and lacks experience. Individual shortcomings in work are inevitable, and at the same time, we are confident to overcome them. This is a specific test for us. Apart from those with hostile intentions, we should examine what kind of thoughts and feelings we have when looking at problems? What position do we stand on?

A handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet betrayed the motherland, colluded with imperialism, and harmed the people. They are truly guilty of heinous crimes. I fully support the government's wise measures. Only by thoroughly quelling the armed rebellion in Tibet and eradicating that small handful of rebellious elements can we carry out democratic reforms that conform to the urgent wishes of the vast majority of the people in Tibet, thereby building a new Tibet, and the Tibetan people can be freed from the shackles of the serf system. We would like to extend our heartfelt respect and condolences to the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army for implementing the State Council's orders and heroically and swiftly eliminating the Tibetan rebellion. The so-called "Dalai's statement" is a fabricated and shameless lie imposed on him by others. I fully agree with the comments published in the People's Daily refuting it. At the same time, we must warn the imperialists and the rebellious elements who fled to India that the era of imperialists manipulating China's internal affairs is long gone, and all conspiracies to split our motherland will surely meet with a shameful failure.

### 向平定西藏叛乱的解放军致敬  刘定五委员的发言

    向平定西藏叛乱的解放军致敬
    刘定五委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    周总理和李富春、李先念两位副总理、彭真、李维汉各位同志的报告总结了我国一九五八年各方面经济建设的辉煌成就，提出了一九五九年的宏伟计划，不禁使我们欢欣鼓舞。虽然我上次在小组发过言，但还不能表达我兴奋愉快的心情于万一，现在再补充一点我的体会。
    这次在视察中看到祖国欣欣向荣的面貌，工、农、教育、文化事业全面大跃进的情况，深深感动了我。大家都知道，我们中国是一个工农业都非常落后的国家，解放九年多以来，在这短短的时间内，不仅轻重工业都有了基础，我们自己能制造飞机、汽车、轮船、精密机器等等，农业也由于采取改良土质、兴修水利、深耕细作等措施，因而粮食丰产，人民生活得到极大的提高，从此摆脱了饥寒交迫的悲惨境遇，而过着康乐幸福的生活，同时我们的国际地位也由过去听任帝国主义任意欺凌摆布的贫弱国家，一跃而为世界上一等强国，这一切情况都说明现在我们的国家欣欣向荣富强昌盛的新气象。为什么在不到十年的短短的时间内能获得这样的伟大成就呢？这是由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，走上建设社会主义的道路。全国人民在党的教育下，实现了空前的大团结，发挥了生产积极性和冲天干劲。由此可以得出结论，我们只有忠诚老实的接受党的领导，坚持走社会主义的道路，才有光明幸福的未来。
    我这次还视察了红星、四季青、十三陵人民公社。人们传颂的“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁”，在视察中我深深体会到这两句话的正确性。由于成立公社后，实行半供给制、半工资制，农民吃饭穿衣等生活问题都解决了，因此，他们心情舒畅，在劳动中欢天喜地的挑战竞赛，生产情绪很高。特别是由于公社对人力物力的统一调配、合理运用，可以很好的发挥人力物力的力量，从而使农作物得以丰产。由此可以看出，人民公社是符合人民最大愿望和利益的组织，也就是说只有通过人民公社的组织形式，人民才能走到幸福灿烂的共产主义社会。但由于人民公社充分显示出了他的优越性，所以就引起了帝国主义和反革命分子的仇视，想尽方法进行攻击污蔑，在国内也有一些头脑不清的先生们（也许是别有用心），看到公社的个别缺点，就加以扩大化，也跟着帝国主义叫嚣，说什么公社有偏差、成立不得等等，这是错误的。人民公社才创办，还缺少经验，个别工作中的缺点是难免的，同时我们也有信心克服它。这就是对我们的一个具体考验，除了怀有敌意的人以外，我们应该检查一下，自己看问题是什么思想感情？站在什么立场？
    西藏少数上层反动分子，背叛祖国，勾结帝国主义，残害人民，真是罪大恶极。我完全拥护政府的英明措施。只有彻底平定了西藏的武装叛乱，铲除了那一小撮叛乱分子，才有可能进行符合西藏极大多数人民的迫切愿望，实现民主改革，从而建设新西藏，西藏人民也才能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁。对我人民解放军西藏军区执行国务院命令，英勇迅速的消灭西藏叛乱，我们要致以衷心的敬意和慰问。所谓“达赖的声明”是别人强加于他的捏造的无耻谎言。我完全同意人民日报所发表的有关驳斥它的评论。同时我们必须警告帝国主义和逃往印度的叛乱分子们，帝国主义摆布中国内政的时代早已经过去了，一切分裂我们祖国的阴谋活动，一定要遭到可耻的失败。
