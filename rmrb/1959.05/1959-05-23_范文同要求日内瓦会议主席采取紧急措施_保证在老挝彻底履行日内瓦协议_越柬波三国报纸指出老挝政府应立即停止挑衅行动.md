Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, has sent a note to the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, requesting them to take urgent and effective measures to ensure that the Geneva Accords on Laos are respected and thoroughly implemented.

	This note was sent to the Soviet government on May 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: According to the Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan", the Lao Kingdom's Sananikone government, at the instigation of the United States, is continuing to vigorously pursue its conspiracy to reignite the civil war in Laos.

	The newspaper said that the Sananikone government violated the agreement signed between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, concentrating a large number of troops to surround the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units stationed in the Tran Ninh Plateau in Xieng Khouang Province, cutting off their supplies, and attempting to force them to disarm. It said that in the face of this situation, the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units stationed there, in order to pursue a policy of national harmony, continue to implement the agreement, and avoid possible conflicts, have withdrawn from their original positions. However, the Sananikone government is still unwilling to give up its conspiracy and is mobilizing more troops to continue to surround and attack these former Pathet Lao Fighting Units; at the same time, it has ordered the Lao Air Force to participate in the fighting and declared the Tran Ninh Plateau to be in a state of war.

	The newspaper continued that, at the same time, the Sananikone government is intensifying its suppression and persecution of progressive forces in Laos, continuing to send troops and police to closely monitor the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front in Vientiane, and has illegally arrested some Lao patriots in various places. Many armed forces of the Lao Kingdom government have been transferred to various strongholds on the Lao-Vietnamese border.

	"Nhan Dan" commented on the Lao authorities' behavior that violates the Geneva Accords and the agreement between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units: "The actions of the Phoui Sananikone government violate the national interests of the Lao people, threaten the independence and democracy of Laos, and undermine the national harmony of the Lao people. The Lao people will absolutely not approve of this behavior. The Vietnamese people will stand firmly with the Lao people to safeguard peace and friendship, so that the above-mentioned conspiracy of US imperialism and its lackeys will be defeated.

	"Faced with the increasingly serious situation in Laos, the Vietnamese people resolutely oppose the Lao authorities' conspiracy to provoke a civil war, further undermine the Geneva Accords, and make the situation in Laos a serious threat to the security of the Indochinese peoples. The Vietnamese people fully support the statement issued by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 17, demanding that the Lao authorities stop their destructive conspiracy in time, otherwise they must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences they have created. The Vietnamese people demand that the Lao International Commission take urgent measures under the current situation to restore its activities in order to stop the conspiracy of the American imperialists and the Lao reactionaries to provoke war in Laos."

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 21st: The Cambodian newspaper "People's News" on May 21st commented on the recent persecution of personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units by the Lao Phoui Sananikone government, saying, "These activities are not accidental, they are the result of long-term arrangements and are part of the overall conspiracy of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to undermine the Geneva Accords, launch a Cold War in Southeast Asia, and threaten world peace."

	The newspaper emphasized that the Cambodian people, as neighbors of Laos and a country concerned with the Geneva Accords, believe that the tense situation in Laos must be stopped, and the persecution and slander of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and their leaders must be stopped immediately to ensure the unity of Laos and ease the tension in Laos and Indochina.

	The newspaper said that the Lao International Commission must continue its monitoring and supervision activities to maintain peace in Laos, Indochina, and the world.

	The newspaper said that the most pressing issue at present is that all participating countries of the Geneva Conference should make their best efforts to ensure that the Geneva Accords and the agreement between the Lao government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units are thoroughly and strictly observed and implemented. The Cambodian people hope that the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, especially the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference – the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom – will take measures to change the dangerous situation in Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 21st: "Życie Warszawy" commented on the Lao situation today, pointing out that the events taking place in Laos are aimed at undermining the Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreement between the Lao Kingdom government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units.

	The newspaper wrote: Prime Minister Sananikone, known for being pro-American, has begun to ban all activities of Lao leaders after exerting much pressure on them.

	The newspaper said, we are concerned about the resumption of the activities of the Lao International Commission to safeguard peace.

	"Sztandar Młodych" pointed out that the reactionary measures taken by the Sananikone government in domestic policy are in line with its policy of resisting the 1954 Geneva Accords. The newspaper pointed out that the Geneva Conference decided that the International Commission responsible for monitoring and supervising Laos could gradually reduce its activities only if its decisions were adopted unanimously, but Sananikone declared on February 11 this year that he was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords and that the commission would not be allowed to carry out any activities in Laos, despite the fact that the Polish representative had declared his disagreement with the cessation of its activities.

    范文同要求日内瓦会议主席采取紧急措施
    保证在老挝彻底履行日内瓦协议
    越柬波三国报纸指出老挝政府应立即停止挑衅行动
    新华社河内22日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部长范文同已经向1954年日内瓦会议的两位主席发出一项照会，要求他们采取紧急的和有效的措施，以保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到尊重和彻底履行。
    这项照会是在5月20日通过苏联政府送交的。
    新华社河内22日电　据越南“人民报”报道，老挝王国萨纳尼空政府在美国唆使下，正在继续大力进行重新挑起老挝内战的阴谋。
    这家报纸说，萨纳尼空政府违反了老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，集中大批军队包围驻扎在川圹省镇宁高原的前寮国战斗部队，切断他们的供应，企图强迫他们缴械。它说，面对这种情况，驻在那里的前寮国战斗部队为了奉行民族和睦政策、继续执行协议和避免可能发生的冲突，已经撤离了原来的驻地。但是萨纳尼空政府还不肯放弃它的阴谋，正在调动更多的军队来继续包围和进攻这些前寮国战斗部队；同时，它还命令老挝空军参加战斗，并宣布镇宁高原处于战争状态。
    这家报纸继续说，与此同时，萨纳尼空政府正在对老挝的进步力量加紧镇压和迫害，继续派遣军队和警察严密监视在万象的老挝爱国党领袖，并且非法逮捕了各地的一些老挝爱国人士。老挝王国政府的许多武装部队已被调往老挝、越南边境的各个据点。
    “人民报”就老挝当局的这种违反日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间的协议的行为发表评论说：“培·萨纳尼空政府的这种行为违背了老挝人民的民族利益，威胁了老挝的独立和民主，破坏了老挝人民的民族和睦。老挝人民绝对不会赞同这种行为。越南人民将坚定不移地同老挝人民站在一起来维护和平和友谊，使美帝国主义及其走狗的上述阴谋归于失败。
    “面对老挝的日益严重的局势，越南人民坚决反对老挝当局阴谋挑起内战，进一步破坏日内瓦协议，使老挝的局势成为对印度支那各民族的安全的严重威胁。越南人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人5月17日发表的声明，要求老挝当局及时停止它的破坏阴谋，否则，它必须对自己制造的严重后果负完全的责任。越南人民要求老挝国际委员会在目前的局势下采取紧急措施，来恢复它的活动，以便制止美帝国主义者和老挝的反动派企图在老挝挑起战争的阴谋。”
    新华社金边21日电　柬埔寨“人民报”21日就最近老挝培·萨纳尼空政府迫害前寮国战斗部队人员发表评论说，“这些活动不是偶然的，它是经过长期的安排，并且是东南亚条约组织破坏日内瓦协议、在东南亚地区发动冷战和威胁世界和平的总的阴谋的一部分”。
    报纸强调指出，作为老挝的邻国和日内瓦协议的有关国家的柬埔寨人民认为，老挝的紧张局势必须加以制止，对前寮国战斗部队及其领导人的迫害和诽谤必须立即停止，以保证老挝的统一，缓和老挝和印度支那的紧张局势。
    报纸说，老挝国际委员会必须继续它的监督和监察活动，以维护老挝、印度支那和全世界的和平。
    报纸说，目前最迫切的问题是日内瓦会议的所有参加国应当尽最大的努力来保证日内瓦协议以及老挝政府和前寮国战斗部队之间的协议得到彻底、严格的遵守和执行。柬埔寨人民希望，苏联、中国、美国、英国和法国尤其是日内瓦会议的两位主席——苏联和英国采取措施，改变老挝的危险局势。
    新华社华沙21日电　“华沙生活报”今天在评论老挝局势时指出，在老挝发生的事件，其目的是破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间的协议。
    报纸写道：以亲美闻名的萨纳尼空首相在对寮国领导人施加许多压力后，开始取缔他们的一切活动。
    报纸说，我们关心恢复老挝国际委员会的活动以保障和平。
    “青年旗帜报”指出，萨纳尼空政府在国内政策方面采取的反动措施是和它抵制1954年日内瓦协议的政策同出一辙的。这家报纸指出，日内瓦会议决定，负责在老挝监察和监督的国际委员会只有在其决定获得一致通过的情况下，才能逐渐减少其活动，而萨纳尼空今年2月11日却声明，他不再受日内瓦协议的约束，委员会在老挝将不得进行任何活动，尽管波兰代表曾声明不同意停止它的活动。
