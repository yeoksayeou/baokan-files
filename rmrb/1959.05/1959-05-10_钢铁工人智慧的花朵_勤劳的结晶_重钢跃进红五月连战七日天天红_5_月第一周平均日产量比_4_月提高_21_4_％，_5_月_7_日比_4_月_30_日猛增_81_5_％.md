Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th May: In the first week of May, the average daily steel output of Chongqing Steel Company increased by 21.4% compared to April; especially on May 7th, the output increased sharply by 81.5% compared to April 30th, creating the company's highest daily output record this year.

In the past few days, the workers in all steelmaking workshops of the company have shown particular tenacity in production and have also demonstrated a high degree of wisdom. Many leading cadres fought side by side with the workers, promptly promoting good experiences and immediately consulting with the masses to solve problems when they were discovered. On May 5th, the sulfur content of molten iron in a furnace of steel in the open-hearth steelmaking workshop reached 0.43%. Under normal circumstances, it would take more than ten hours to reduce the sulfur content to below the specified standard. The steelworkers, in a moment of ingenuity, came up with a method called "cooking rice in a covered pot," not adding slag during the refining time. As a result, they produced a furnace of qualified steel in just eight minutes and five seconds. The workshop leadership immediately promoted this experience, and the overfulfiled the leap forward plan on the same day; the output on the 7th continued to grow, exceeding the original plan by nearly one-third. The pig iron used in the small open-hearth workshop one day had a high sulfur content. Qu Renjie, the party branch secretary of the workshop, discussed countermeasures with the masses, and the production situation was very good. For example, the smelting time of each furnace of steel smelted on the 1st furnace that day was shortened by two or three hours compared with the past, and the shortest time for one furnace was five minutes and fifty nine seconds, thus greatly exceeding the daily plan.

　　钢铁工人智慧的花朵　勤劳的结晶
    重钢跃进红五月连战七日天天红
    5月第一周平均日产量比4月提高21.4％，5月7日比4月30日猛增81.5％
    新华社重庆9日电　5月份的第一周，重庆钢铁公司钢的平均日产量比4月份提高21.4％；尤其是5月7日，产量比4月30日猛增81.5％，创造了这个公司今年以来日产量的最高纪录。
    这几天，全公司各个炼钢车间的工人们，在生产中表现得特别顽强，也发挥了高度的智慧。许多领导干部同工人并肩作战，发现好的经验便及时推广，发现问题便立即同群众商量解决。5月5日，大平炉炼钢车间有一炉钢的铁水含硫量达到0.43％，按照一般情况，需要炼十多个小时才能使含硫量降低到规定标准以下；炼钢工人们情急智生，想出了一个叫做“煮焖锅饭”的办法，在精炼时间不放渣，结果只用了八点零五分钟时间就炼出了一炉合格钢。车间领导上立即推广这个经验，当天就超额完成了跃进计划；7日的产量继续增长，比原计划超额近三分之一。小平炉车间有一天用的生铁含硫量较高，车间党总支书记瞿仁杰就和群众一道商量出对策，结果生产情况很好。如一号炉这一天炼的几炉钢，每炉的冶炼时间都比过去缩短了两三个小时，时间最短的一炉是五点五十九分钟，因此使日计划大大超额完成。（附图片）
