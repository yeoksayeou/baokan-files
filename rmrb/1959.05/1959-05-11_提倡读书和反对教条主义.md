    Advocating Reading and Opposing Dogmatism
    Xu Feiguang
    On the basis of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, and in the context of the Great Leap Forward, more and more people feel that, while personally participating in revolutionary practice and production practice, they should also squeeze out time to sit down and seriously read some books, systematically study some theory, and learn some scientific knowledge in order to understand and solve the theoretical and practical problems that are emerging around them with each passing day. This is also a matter of being compelled by the situation; failing to do so will make it impossible to adapt to the current needs. However, when reading is mentioned, some people tend to associate it with dogmatism. They worry, will sitting down to read turn them into dogmatists? Will others say that you are detached from reality? This kind of thinking hinders some comrades from better learning and mastering theory and knowledge.
    Reading is not Equal to Dogmatism
    In fact, dogmatism and reading are completely different things, and an equal sign cannot be drawn between them. There is no causal relationship between them either.
    Reading is an important way and means for human beings to learn and master theory and knowledge. To master Marxism, one must participate in revolutionary struggle and production struggle, and at the same time, one must systematically study the theoretical knowledge of Marxism. Dogmatism, on the other hand, arises from the wrong attitude and method towards reading and learning Marxist theoretical knowledge. Therefore, reading is not the direct cause of dogmatism. Lenin read Marx's works and successfully led the Russian proletarian revolution; while Kautsky read Marx's works but became a revisionist. Similarly, after reading Marxist works, in the situation of the Chinese bourgeois rightists' attack in 1957, some people quickly recognized the true colors of the rightists and actively used this weapon to launch a counterattack against them, while others had no power to fight back under the rightists' attack and were even confused by them, to the point of becoming their prisoners.
    Marxists do not Despise Reading
    One cannot have the view that dogmatists value theory, while Marxists despise theory. In this way, it seems that reading and learning theory have become the "specialty" and "privilege" of dogmatists, and that one should not read books in order not to become a dogmatist.
    In Russia, this kind of view once existed, and some people believed that Leninism emphasized practice and neglected theory. Stalin once refuted this extremely wrong view, pointing out that "the tendency of practical workers to ignore theory is completely contrary to the spirit of Leninism and contains great dangers harmful to the cause." In the history of the Chinese Party, dogmatists also once slandered Comrade Mao Zedong as a "narrow empiricist," but facts have proved that it was not the dogmatists who applied and developed Marxist theory in China, but precisely Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong has reminded all Party comrades to work hard to study Marxist theory more than once. As early as 1938, he said: "A party that guides a great revolutionary movement cannot achieve victory without revolutionary theory, without historical knowledge, and without a deep understanding of the practical movement." Marxism believes that theory comes from practice, but it in turn can guide practice. Theory that is divorced from practice is empty, but practice without theoretical guidance is also blind.
    Therefore, it is not the dogmatists who truly value theory, but the Marxists. Dogmatists value theory on the surface, but what they value is only the words of Marxism. As for the spirit and essence of Marxism, in their view, it is not something important, and they do not even know how to combine revolutionary theory with revolutionary practice. Moreover, some dogmatists read very few books, and even lack some of the most basic theoretical common sense, but they also peddle their dogmatism in a big way. This kind of "theoretician" is intimidating in appearance, but is often empty inside. The reason why dogmatists can deceive people for a while mainly relies on the weakness of the low theoretical level of the vast number of Party members.
    From this, it can be seen that Marxists not only value practice, but also attach great importance to the significance of theory; dogmatists not only despise practice, but also do not truly value theory.
    Opposing Dogmatism is the Only Way to Develop Theory
    A revolutionary political party has always been incompatible with dogmatic bookworms, because the existence of dogmatism will turn lively theoretical research into dry and tasteless word games, will bind the development of theory, and even endanger the cause of the revolution. In the history of the Chinese Party, we have suffered from dogmatism more than once. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, due to the harm of dogmatism, almost 90% of the revolutionary forces were lost. Therefore, our Party has repeatedly opened fire on dogmatism, the most concentrated time being the rectification campaign in 1942. However, when we criticized dogmatism, we never opposed reading and studying theory. What we criticized was only the bad style of reciting the words of Marxism but not knowing how to apply them according to the conditions of the Chinese revolution. The purpose of our criticism of dogmatism is to better exert the great combat role of Marxism, and to learn how to use the universal truth of Marxism to guide our revolutionary movement and specific work under specific conditions.
    The development of history also eloquently shows that the direct result of each time we criticize dogmatism is not the decline of Marxist theory, but the leap forward development of Marxist theory.
    Discredit Dogmatism and Promote the Atmosphere of Reading
    From the above, it can be seen that dogmatism is not caused by reading, but by the wrong attitude and method towards learning Marxist theory. If one only reads books and does not participate in practice, theorizes for the sake of theory, and reads for the sake of reading, then this kind of person who reads books will of course become a dogmatist and a bookworm; however, if the relationship between theory and practice is correctly resolved, then dogmatism will not occur. Lenin said, "Without work, without struggle, then the book knowledge of communism obtained solely from communist pamphlets and writings can be said to be worthless, because this knowledge will still retain the most hateful feature of the old capitalist society, namely, the separation of theory and practice." Our current situation is that many people have actively participated in revolutionary struggle and production struggle, and social practice is constantly raising many new problems that require theoretical guidance. In this case, learning theory is to solve practical problems, so there is no need to be afraid of dogmatism. Moreover, from an objective point of view, we do not read too much, but too little; our theoretical level is not very high, but cannot adapt to the needs of the development of the situation. Therefore, as long as the direction is correct and the method is correct, Marxist books must be read extensively.
    Of course, emphasizing reading does not mean that the new atmosphere of valuing social practice and actively participating in social practice that has been formed since the rectification campaign can be discarded, and that one can shut oneself back in the study again. What we want is to truly combine the two aspects, valuing both theory and practice. Therefore, on the basis of discrediting dogmatism, greatly promoting the atmosphere of reading and studying theory is not only not to return to dogmatism, but precisely to meet the urgent demands raised objectively. Moreover, in a certain sense, only when the theoretical level of the entire Party is greatly improved, will dogmatism be more difficult to hide.

### 提倡读书和反对教条主义

    提倡读书和反对教条主义
    徐非光
    在整风反右的基础上，在大跃进的形势下，越来越多的人感到，在亲身参加革命实践和生产实践的同时，还要挤出时间坐下来，认真地读点书、系统地学点理论、学点科学知识，以便认识和解决周围日新月异出现的理论问题和实践问题。这也是形势逼人，不如此便不能适应当前的需要。但是，提到读书，有的人便往往把它和教条主义联系在一起。他们顾虑，坐下来读书会不会变成教条主义者？别人会不会说你是脱离实际？这种思想阻碍着一些同志更好地学习和掌握理论和知识。
    读书不等于教条主义
    事实上，教条主义和读书是完全不同的两回事，不能在它们之间划上等号。它们之间也没有因果的关系。
    读书，这是人类学习和掌握理论和知识的一个重要的途径和手段。要掌握马克思主义，就要参加革命斗争和生产斗争，同时又要系统地学习马克思主义的理论知识。教条主义则是因对待读书，对待学习马克思主义理论知识的错误态度和方法而产生的。因此，读书并不是产生教条主义的直接原因。列宁读了马克思的著作，成功地领导了俄国无产阶级革命；而考茨基读了马克思的著作，却变成了修正主义者。同样读了马克思主义著作，在1957年中国资产阶级右派进攻的情况下，有的人很快地认清了右派的面目，积极地运用这个武器向右派展开了反击，而有的人却在右派进攻下毫无反击力量，甚至受到他们的迷惑，以至变成他们的俘虏。
    马克思主义者并不轻视读书
    不能有这样一种看法，似乎教条主义者重视理论，而马克思主义者轻视理论。这样一来，似乎读书、学理论便成了教条主义者的“专长”和“特权”，要想不变成教条主义者就不应当读书。
    在俄国就曾经发生过这种看法，有人认为列宁主义是重实践轻理论的。斯大林曾经驳斥过这种极端错误的看法，他指出：“实际工作者忽视理论的趋向，是完全与列宁主义的精神相矛盾的，而且包含着有害于事业的巨大危险”。在中国党的历史上，教条主义者也曾经污蔑过毛泽东同志是“狭隘的经验论”者，但是事实证明，在中国运用和发展了马克思主义理论的不是教条主义者，而恰恰是毛泽东同志。毛泽东同志不止一次地提醒全党同志努力学习马克思主义理论，早在1938年他就说过：“指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。”马克思主义认为，理论来自实践，但是，它反过来又能指导实践。脱离实践的理论是空洞的，但是没有理论指导的实践也是盲目的。
    因此，真正重视理论的并不是教条主义者，而是马克思主义者。教条主义者在表面上是重视理论的，但他们重视的仅仅是马克思主义的词句，至于马克思主义的精神实质，在他们看来，并不是什么重要的东西，他们更不懂得把革命的理论和革命的实践结合起来。并且，有一些教条主义者，他们连书本也读得很少，甚至连一些最起码的理论常识也非常缺乏，他们也大贩其教条主义。这种“理论家”以貌吓人，而肚子里却往往是一无所有。教条主义者之所以能够招摇撞骗一时，主要还是依靠了我们党内广大党员理论水平不高的弱点。
    由此可见，马克思主义者不仅重视实践，而且也十分重视理论的意义；教条主义者不仅轻视实践，而且也并不真正重视理论。
    反对教条主义才能发展理论
    一个革命的政党从来都是和教条主义书呆子不相容的，因为教条主义的存在，会把生动活泼的理论研究变成干燥无味的词句游戏，会束缚理论的发展，甚至危害革命的事业。在中国党的历史上，我们曾不止一次地吃过教条主义的亏。第二次国内革命战争中，由于教条主义的危害，几乎丧失了90％的革命力量。因此，我们党曾经多次地向教条主义开火，最集中的一次是1942年的整风。但是，我们在批判教条主义的时候，从来也没有反对过读书和学习理论。我们批判的只是那种背诵马克思主义的词句、却不懂得根据中国革命的条件加以运用的恶劣作风。我们批判教条主义的目的是为了更好地发挥马克思主义的巨大战斗作用，为了学会在具体的条件下运用马克思主义的普遍真理来指导我们的革命运动和具体工作。
    历史的发展也雄辩地表明了，每次我们批判了教条主义之后所引起的直接结果，并不是马克思主义理论的下降，而是马克思主义理论的飞跃发展。
    搞臭教条主义，发扬读书风气
    由以上可看出，教条主义并不是读书造成的，而是对待学习马克思主义理论的错误态度和方法造成的。如果光读书不参加实践，为理论而理论，为读书而读书，那么这种读书的人当然要变成教条主义者和书呆子；但是，如果正确地解决了理论和实际的关系，那么教条主义就不会发生了。列宁说过，“没有工作，没有斗争，那么单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得书本上的共产主义知识，可以说是一文钱不值，因为这种知识仍旧会是把资本主义旧社会中最可恶的特征，即理论与实践隔离的现象保持下去”。我们现在的情况是，许多人已经积极地参加了革命斗争和生产斗争，社会实践不断地提出了许多新的问题，需要有理论的指导。在这种情况下，学习理论是为了解决实际的问题，因此，就不必害怕教条主义。并且，从客观的要求来看，我们的书不是读得太多，而是读得太少；我们的理论水平不是很高，而是不能适应形势发展的需要。因此，只要方向对头，方法对头，马克思主义的书还是要大读特读的。
    当然，强调读书绝不是说，可以把整风以来所形成的重视社会实践、积极参加社会实践的新风气丢掉，重新把自己关到书斋中去。我们所要的是，真正地把两方面结合起来，既要重视理论，又要重视实践。因此，在搞臭教条主义的基础上，把读书和研究理论的学习风气大大发扬起来，这不仅不是要重新回到教条主义去，而正是满足客观上提出来的迫切要求。并且，在一定的意义上说，只有在全党的理论水平大大提高的情况下，教条主义才更难于藏身。
