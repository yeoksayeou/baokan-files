Xinhua News Agency, New York, 4th: Despite the widespread protests of the American people, the US judicial authorities have unreasonably rejected the request of the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party to postpone the execution of the illegal sentences imposed on them pending the Supreme Court's reopening in October, and have brazenly ordered the eleven American Communist leaders to be imprisoned on July 2nd.

　　On July 2nd, seven Communist leaders - Dennis, Williamson, Stachel, Potash, Gates, Winter, Davis - were summoned to appear in federal court.

　　The Communist leaders' defense lawyer, Sacher, rebuked prosecutor Saypol in court for unreasonably demanding the immediate imprisonment of the Communist leaders and demanded a postponement of the execution of the sentence based on reason. Judge Ryan completely ignored all the reasons and requests put forward by Sacher, and immediately ordered the imprisonment of the seven Communist leaders who appeared in court, and also ordered the arrest of the four Communist leaders who did not appear in court - Hall, Winston, Thompson, and Green - and confiscated their bail.

　　Defense lawyer Isserman requested a stay of execution of Stachel's sentence because Stachel suffered from a serious heart condition, and imprisonment could endanger his life. This request was also flatly rejected by Ryan. Prosecutor Saypol said shamelessly and outrageously, "Imprisonment is the most effective treatment for heart disease."

　　In defending himself, the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Dennis, pointed out that with the imprisonment of the eleven Communist leaders, the clauses in the American Constitution concerning democratic rights "were also imprisoned at the same time."

　　Davis, disregarding the judge's threats of "contempt" of court, resolutely pointed out in court that the court's verdict was a verdict against democracy, against the working class, and against the black people. When the judge stopped him from speaking, he said loudly: "The court cannot frighten me. One day the enemies of the people will be put in prison. Our struggle for peace and freedom will continue until victory."

　　After the court hearing, the seven Communist leaders were immediately handcuffed and imprisoned in the New York City Federal Prison.

　　美司法当局不顾美国人民的广泛抗议
    竟将七名美共领袖投入监狱
    戴维斯表示决将继续斗争直到胜利
    【新华社四日讯】纽约消息：美国司法当局不顾美国人民的广泛抗议，已无理地拒绝了美国共产党十一位领袖要求延缓执行对他们非法判处的徒刑以待最高法院在十月重新开庭的要求，而悍然下令把十一位美共领袖于七月二日投入监狱。
    七月二日，七名共产党领袖——但尼斯、威廉逊、史塔彻、鲍达希、盖兹、温特尔、戴维斯——被传到联邦法院出庭。
    共产党领袖的辩护律师瑟琪尔在庭上斥责检察官赛波尔无理要求立即监禁共产党领袖，并据理要求延期执行徒刑。法官赖恩对瑟琪尔所提出的各项理由与要求完全置之不理，竟即下令监禁出庭的七位共产党领袖，同时还下令拘捕未出庭的四位共产党领袖——霍尔、温斯顿、汤普生、葛麟，并把他们的保释金没收。
    辩护律师伊斯尔曼要求停止执行史塔彻的徒刑，因为史塔彻患有严重的心脏病，监禁可能危及他的生命。这个要求也被赖恩断然拒绝。检察官赛波尔无耻绝伦地说：“监禁对于心脏病是一种最有效的治疗法。”
    美共总书记但尼斯在为自己申辩时指出，随着十一位共产党领袖的下狱，美国宪法中关于民主权利的条款“也同时被下狱了”。
    戴维斯不顾法官以“蔑视”法庭罪相威吓，在庭上坚决指出法庭的判决是对民主、对工人阶级和黑色人民的判决。在法官制止他发言时，他高声说道：“法庭吓不倒我。总有一天人民的敌人会被关入监狱。我们争取和平与自由的斗争将继续下去直到胜利。”
    在法庭审讯完毕后，七名共产党领袖即被带上手铐，关入纽约市联邦监狱。
