A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:
　　The criticism by reader Jin Lijing, published in the People's Daily on April 2nd, regarding our factory's trade union abandoning leadership of labor insurance work, is entirely correct. Our factory's trade union has done very poorly in the past regarding labor insurance work. This is mainly because trade union cadres did not seriously study labor insurance issues, and trade union leaders failed to understand that labor insurance not only protects the health of workers and solves their living difficulties but also, through this work, can raise workers' political awareness and effectively improve production. Therefore, the trade union failed to actively and proactively care for the health of workers, actively prevent illness and injuries, and supervise medical work through the implementation of labor insurance, instead treating the implementation of labor insurance as a purely technical task. Since the implementation of labor insurance in the Northeast region in July 1949, our factory's trade union has long lacked a labor insurance committee. Workers requesting labor insurance benefits were approved by the trade union chairman only in a few important cases, with most handled by the accountant in charge of labor insurance funds. As a result, correct principles could not be grasped, and some people received benefits they should not have. For example, when the younger brother of Zhao Changling, the director of the factory's No. 1 workshop, died at over twenty years of age, he was still treated as an immediate family member and received a death subsidy (which has now been decided to be returned by Zhao Changling). The accountant managing the labor insurance funds was also very careless in reviewing the labor insurance fund expenditures of the worker's sanatorium, paying based solely on the receipts submitted by the sanatorium's cook. In particular, due to a lack of attention to the safekeeping of labor insurance funds, they were stolen twice in August and September 1950, resulting in a loss of over 36 million yuan (Northeast currency) in labor insurance funds, as well as 49.7 million yuan in trade union membership fees, cultural and educational fees, and mutual aid funds.
　　After the newspaper's criticism and our self-examination, working cadres have begun to pay attention to labor insurance work and are preparing to implement the following improvements: (1) Running short-term training classes to enable relevant cadres at all levels of the factory trade union to seriously study the labor insurance regulations and implementation details, and through broadcasting, regularly conduct propaganda on labor insurance to all factory workers. (2) Strengthening the organization, with basic and workshop trade unions establishing labor insurance committees as required, and each trade union group electing labor insurance representatives to be specifically responsible for this work. (3) Strictly reviewing the expenditure of labor insurance funds, and re-regulating the work of the labor insurance accountant. In the past, the labor insurance accountant worked in the basic trade union office, handling the examination and approval of workers' requests for labor insurance benefits, bookkeeping, and the receipt and expenditure of funds. Now, workers' requests for labor insurance benefits must be reviewed by personnel responsible for labor insurance work in the trade union group and workshop trade union, and finally approved by the chairman of the basic trade union; the labor insurance accountant has moved to the finance section of the administrative department to work, only handling bookkeeping, while the expenditure and safekeeping of cash are the responsibility of a designated person in the finance section.

### 沈阳第一机器厂工会改进对劳动保险工作的领导

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　  沈阳第一机器厂工会改进对劳动保险工作的领导编辑同志：
    人民日报四月二日读者来信栏刊登的读者金力静同志对我厂工会放弃领导劳动保险工作的批评，是完全正确的。我厂工会过去对劳动保险工作作的很坏，这主要是因为工会干部对劳动保险问题没有认真学习，工会领导干部没有了解到劳动保险不仅是可以保障职工身体的健康，解决职工生活的困难，而且通过这一工作，更可以提高工人的政治觉悟，并有效地提高生产。因此，工会未能积极主动地通过实行劳动保险，照顾职工的健康，积极防病、防伤与监督医疗工作，而只是把实行劳动保险当成单纯的技术工作。自一九四九年七月东北区实行劳动保险以来，我厂工会长期没有劳动保险委员会的组织，职工请求领用劳动保险金，除个别重要的由工会主席批准外，一般的均由保管劳动保险金的会计处理，因此不能掌握正确的原则，有人不该领用的也领了。如本厂第一车间主任赵长令的弟弟死时，年龄已过二十岁，仍按直系亲属待遇，领了死亡补助金（现此款已决定由赵长令退回）。管理劳动保险金的会计，对职工疗养所支用劳动保险金的审查也非常马虎，只凭该所厨师所交的单据付款。特别是由于不重视劳动保险金的保管，在一九五○年八、九两月，曾两次被盗，损失劳动保险金三千六百余万元（东北币，下同），工会会费、文教费、互助费等四千九百七十余万元。
    经过报纸的批评和我们的检查，工作干部对劳动保险工作已开始重视起来，并准备实行以下的改进办法：（一）开办短期训练班，使本厂工会各级有关干部认真学习劳动保险条例及实施细则，并通过广播，经常向全厂职工进行关于劳动保险的宣传。（二）健全组织，基层和车间工会均按规定成立劳动保险委员会，各工会小组选出劳动保险代表，专门负责此项工作。（三）严格审核劳动保险金的支出，重新规定劳动保险会计的工作。劳动保险会计过去是在基层工会办公室内办公，掌管职工请求劳动保险金的审核、记账和金钱的收支保管等。现在，职工请求劳动保险金，必须由工会小组及车间工会负责劳动保险工作的人员提出意见，最后并经基层工会主席批准；劳动保险会计已搬到行政部门的财务科办公，只管记账，对现金的支出和保管，则由财务科指定专人负责。
