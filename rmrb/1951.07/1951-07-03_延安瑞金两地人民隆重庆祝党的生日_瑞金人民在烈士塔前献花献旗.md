The people of Yan'an, the former residence of the CCP Central Committee, solemnly celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. At 10:00 AM on the 1st, more than a thousand communists, members of the Communist Youth League, non-party activists, and democrats from various organs, troops, factories, and schools in Yan'an gathered to celebrate the Party's birthday. After the meeting, CCP branches in various organs held small celebration meetings separately.

From mid-June, CCP members, members of the Communist Youth League, and the broad masses of workers in various organs, factories, and schools launched a study of the history of the Communist Party of China. Before "July 1st," party members, league members, and the masses in various townships throughout the city, as well as farmers in Yangjialing, Zaoyuan, and other places where the CCP Central Committee was located in the past, held discussion meetings to recall their living conditions over the past decade.

All the farmers in Yangjialing Village and Shen Changlin, a famous labor model party member in Yan'an, wrote letters to Chairman Mao before "July 1st" to report on the recovery of production.

The people of Yan'an also actively donated weapons to support the Korean front as a practical action to celebrate this year's "July 1st." The city's industrial and commercial circles donated over 100 million yuan in three days. The farmers in Zaoyuan Village, where Chairman Mao once lived, donated 360,000 yuan in less than an hour.

Xinhua News Agency, Ruijin, 2nd:

The people of Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, the site of the Central Democratic Government during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, warmly celebrated the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on July 1st. On the morning of that day, various organs, troops, schools, citizens, and suburban farmers in Ruijin County beat gongs and drums to congratulate the CCP Ruijin County Committee, and held a ceremony to celebrate and pay respect to the Communist Party of China at Chairman Mao's former residence in Shazhouba Township in the suburbs.

At 9:00 AM, more than 15,000 communists and people from all walks of life in the county held a grand commemorative meeting in the square in front of the Chinese Red Army Martyrs' Memorial Tower in the east of the city. At the meeting, Zhang Zhe, secretary of the CCP Ruijin County Committee, called on all communists in the county to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hard, and to strive to better lead the people of the revolutionary hometown in revolutionary construction. Representatives from all walks of life delivered speeches. Yang Shiqiu, chairman of the Luyang Township Farmers' Association, said: We, the farmers of the revolutionary hometown, will resolutely follow the Communist Party of China to move forward to create a better life. He said: In order to strengthen the power of the motherland, Luyang Township has enthusiastically launched a production increase campaign. Farmers throughout the township have received more than 70 million yuan in donations for donating the "Ruijin" fighter jet. The masses who participated in the meeting also solemnly presented flowers and flags to the Chinese communists and revolutionary martyrs who gloriously sacrificed in the revolutionary war in front of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Martyrs' Memorial Tower.

Farmers in various districts and townships held commemorative meetings in separate districts on "July 1st." In order to commemorate the history of the heroic struggle of the Communist Party of China in leading the people, various cultural relics from the Second Revolutionary Civil War period were displayed in Chairman Mao's former residence in Shazhouba Village: spears, earthen cannons, and land certificates issued by the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government. These cultural relics were preserved by the farmers at the risk of their lives under the terrorist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
