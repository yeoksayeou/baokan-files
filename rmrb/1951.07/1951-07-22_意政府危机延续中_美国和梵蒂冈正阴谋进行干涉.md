　　Italian Government Crisis Continues
　  US and Vatican Conspiring to Interfere
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Rome] The Italian government crisis continues. Italian President Einaudi successively received Senate President Nicola, Chamber of Deputies President Gronchi, former Prime Ministers Orlando, Nitti, and Bonomi, former Constituent Assembly Presidents Saragat and Terracini, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti, and Italian Socialist Party General Secretary Nenni on the 18th and 19th, continuing consultations on how to resolve the government crisis. Political figures believe that this crisis will be complex and long-lasting.

    Currently, the people's movement across Italy demanding the establishment of a peace government to replace the De Gasperi government is constantly rising. From Milan to Sicily, people everywhere are voicing their support for this demand.

    On July 18th, hundreds of gatherings and demonstrations of various kinds were held in cities and villages in Lombardy, Emilia, Tuscany, Apulia, Campania, Sicily, and other regions of Italy, demanding the establishment of a peace government. On this day, workers in many enterprises across the country held strikes lasting from one to two hours, demanding the establishment of a government that could implement the development of peaceful industry and realize the labor program of the Italian General Confederation of Labor. This program put forward specific plans for developing Italy's peaceful economy.

    According to reports in the Italian democratic press, the Italian President has received a constant stream of telegrams, letters, and resolutions demanding fundamental revisions to the Italian government's political direction and the holding of new parliamentary elections.

    In the face of this powerful demand from the Italian people, the US Embassy in Italy, together with the Vatican, is jointly directing the Italian reactionaries, doing everything possible to salvage the already collapsing rule of the De Gasperi government. According to a report by the Teletype Agency: the Vatican's newspaper *L'Osservatore Romano* and the Catholic Action League's newspaper *Il Quotidiano* have loudly called on Christian Democratic Party members of parliament to recognize the seriousness of the current situation, quell their disputes, and save the "fundamental matters." At the same time, Pope Pius XII specially received Veronese, the chairman of the Catholic Action League, on the 18th, while the Catholic Action League is precisely the behind-the-scenes manipulator of the Christian Democratic Party.

    US Ambassador Dunn has even openly come forward to support the De Gasperi government. He blatantly stated at De Gasperi's recent reception welcoming the US Senate delegation that Italian industrialists may obtain more "US aid," but the US first requires Italy to have the "maximum political stability," and personnel and program changes must not be perceived as weakening Atlantic policies.

    However, all of this cannot change the state of serious division and chaos within the Christian Democratic Party. Although the Christian Democratic Party leadership once again nominated De Gasperi as a candidate for Prime Minister on the 18th, this did not receive enough support within the party. Christian Democratic Party members of parliament in both the upper and lower houses firmly demanded a plenary session of the parliamentary party group on this day, which the party leadership dared not agree to. According to the Socialist Party's *Avanti!*, even at the meeting of the party leadership, the majority of members categorically opposed the return of Treasury and Budget Minister Pella and Foreign Minister Sforza to the government.

### 意政府危机延续中  美国和梵蒂冈正阴谋进行干涉

　　意政府危机延续中
　  美国和梵蒂冈正阴谋进行干涉
    【新华社二十一日讯】罗马消息：意大利的政府危机仍在延续中，意大利总统伊诺第于十八日和十九日先后接见了上院主席尼可拉、下院主席格隆齐，三个前内阁总理奥兰多、尼提与巴尔里，两个前立宪大会主席萨拉盖特与特拉齐尼，以及意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂和意大利社会党总书记南尼，继续协商解决政府危机的办法。政界人士认为这个危机将是复杂和长期的。
    现在意大利全国人民要求建立和平政府以代替加斯贝利政府的人民运动，正在不断高涨。从米兰一直到西西里，到处人民都发出了支持这个要求的呼声。
    七月十八日，在伦巴第、艾米利亚、杜斯坎尼、阿浦利亚、卡潘尼亚、西西里和意大利其他各区的城市和村庄中，举行了数以百计的各种集会和示威，要求成立和平政府。这一天，全国许多企业的工人们，都举行了一点钟到两点钟的罢工，要求成立一个能执行发展和平工业和实现意大利总工会的劳动纲领的政府。这个纲领提出了发展意大利和平经济的具体方案。
    据意大利民主报纸报道，意大利总统接到了川流不息的电报、信件和决议，要求根本修改意大利政府的政治方针并举行新的议会选举。
    在意大利人民这种强有力的要求面前，美国驻意大利的大使馆正和梵蒂冈共同指挥意大利反动派，竭力企图挽救加斯贝利政府已经垮台的统治。据电通社报道：梵蒂冈的机关报《罗马观察家》报和天主教行动联盟机关报《每日新闻》已大声疾呼基督教民主党议员应认清目前局势的严重，平息他们的纷争，来挽救“根本大事”。同时，教皇庇护还在十八日特地接见了天主教行动联盟的主席维隆尼塞，而天主教行动联盟却正是基督教民主党的幕后操纵者。
    美国大使邓恩更公开出面支持加斯贝利政府。他在加斯贝利最近欢迎美国参议院代表团的招待会上露骨地表示：意大利工业家可能获得更多的“美援”，但美国首先要求意大利必须有“最大限度的政治稳定”，而人事和纲领的更动不得有使人认为有削弱大西洋政策的现象。
    但是，所有这一些都不能改变基督教民主党内严重的分裂与混乱的状态。虽然基督教民主党领导机构已于十八日再次提名加斯贝利为内阁总理候选人，但是这并没有得到党内足够的支持。基督教民主党上、下两院议员在这一天坚决要求召开议会党团全体会议，该党领导机构竟不敢答应。据社会党的《前进报》报道，就在该党领导机构的会议上，大多数成员都断然表示反对国库与预算部长贝拉和外交部长史佛卓重返政府。
