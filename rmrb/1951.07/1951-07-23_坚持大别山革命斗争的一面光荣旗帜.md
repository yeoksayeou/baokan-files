A Glorious Banner of Perseverance in the Revolutionary Struggle in the Dabie Mountains
Zhang Ruojia

　　As early as 1927, peasants in Huang'an and Macheng counties in the Dabie Mountains, under the leadership of local Communist Party members such as Zheng Weisan, launched an armed uprising. The revolutionary storm swept through the Dabie Mountains. In 1929, Luo Houfu, the nineteen-year-old son of a poor peasant from Fotasi, Huang'an, joined the Red Guards. The following year, he joined the Communist Party and the Red Army.

　　Under the peasant uprising, the Red Army developed rapidly. In 1929, they established the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Workers' and Peasants' Government. Two years later, the Hubei-Henan-Anhui revolutionary base area expanded to three million people, and the Red Army grew to 60,000, shattering five encirclements and suppressions by counter-revolutionary troops. The Red Fourth Front Army and the Red Twenty-Fifth Army left the base area successively in 1932 and 1934, leaving guerrilla forces (later reorganized into the Red Twenty-Eighth Army) to continue to persevere in the original place. Comrade Luo Houfu was one of the Communist Party members who, in accordance with the Party's instructions, consistently persisted in the armed revolutionary struggle in the Dabie Mountains.

　　Thorough land reform and political emancipation gave Luo Houfu and other peasant soldiers their first lesson in class education; the bloody slaughter by class enemies gave them their second lesson. After the main force left, they left the land and houses they had been allocated. Comrade Luo Houfu, leading several people, transferred to Qiligang, Macheng, and immediately wiped out more than 30 enemies.

　　The enemy implemented a "consolidation of villages" in the revolutionary base area, driving mountain residents to the plains, attempting to turn the Dabie Mountains into a "no-man's land," and cutting off the connection between the guerrillas and the masses. In order to starve the guerrillas to death, the bandit army cut down all the trees and bushes on the mountains in the spring and summer, and set fire to the mountains in the winter. Forts were scattered all along the roads, and every bungalow was stationed with the Kuomintang reactionary army and the "militia" of landlords.

　　In 1933, the guerrilla force of forty to fifty men led by Luo Houfu was scattered by the enemy while operating in the Huayuan area of Xiaogan. Anxiously, he went to Macheng to ask the Party for instructions. There he met Comrade Zheng Weisan, the Party leader in Hubei-Henan-Anhui. The Party studied the special conditions of the armed struggle in Hubei-Henan-Anhui under the new situation—an isolated area surrounded by powerful enemies, lacking a base area, lacking the cooperation of large forces—and put forward a clear policy and task: "Persistence is victory." The Party also summarized and improved the good experience of the local armed struggle, proposing the use of plainclothes teams, "political activities relying on the original mass base, military activities going out at night and hiding during the day," "establishing a mass base under white terror," and other mass work lines and political slogans such as "doing work under the white flag."

　　Luo Houfu received seven Mauser pistols, two silver dollars, and more importantly, direction, confidence, and courage. He returned to his familiar area, reorganized his team of only four people, and began to develop revolutionary forces separately.

　　At this time, under the enemy's blockade, they ate wild vegetables, tree bark, and pumpkins, and were cut off from oil and salt for three or four months. In order to conceal their targets, they did not make smoke during the day or light fires at night, and covered the mountain roads they had traveled with dead branches and leaves. When the mountain trees were burned, they hid in mountain caves; in winter, they wore three layers of summer cloth as cotton clothes, and used rags to wrap their feet instead of shoes and socks. But the more difficulties there were, the more actively they engaged in activities. Luo Houfu fought as a guerrilla while organizing the CCP District Committee, striving to develop the Party organization, and establishing the people's own government.

　　Peasants who could not bear the enemy's oppression flocked to the guerrilla force. From southern Henan to southern Hubei, from the West Dabie Mountains to the East Dabie Mountains, they established more than two hundred small guerrilla teams ranging from thirty to fifty to seventy or eighty people. The guerrilla area under the leadership of Comrade Luo Houfu expanded to Shangcheng, Gushi, Guangshan, Lishan, Luoshan, Macheng, Xinxian, and Huang'an, and the number of guerrillas developed into a guerrilla division. They came out at night to organize the masses and fight local tyrants, and hid in Lao Jun Mountain and Tiantai Mountain during the day.

　　The people of Hubei-Henan-Anhui used folk songs full of respect and revolutionary optimism to sing about their own guerrilla teams, who were tenacious and fearless in difficult environments:

　　"Mountain slate is the bed of Party members, (The masses called the guerrillas 'Party members')
　　Green branches and leaves are the houses of Party members,
　　Sweet potatoes and peanuts are the grain of Party members.
　　..."

　　When recalling these things, Comrade Luo Houfu smiled and said, "This period was of course more difficult, but as long as there are masses, there is a way."

　　Believing in the masses, connecting with the masses, and resolutely implementing the Party's mass work line is one of the prominent characteristics of Comrade Luo Houfu. Therefore, although under the white terror, most of the masses who had been driven away by the enemy returned to the guerrilla area, and the Party established mass organizations in many villages.

　　That was the time when the enemy threatened the masses with "execution of the whole family for failing to report 'bandits'," and when the enemy forced the masses to "beat gongs and shout when they saw guerrillas." One day in 1933, the town of Kaifang in Xinxian was garrisoned by a regiment of the Red Twenty-Fifth Army. In the middle of the night, the hired worker Luo Yiju traveled more than twenty miles of mountain road to send intelligence to Luo Houfu: "Several regiments of the enemy have set out from Qiliping, Fajiahe, Yuwangcheng, Huangbeidian, Xuanhuadian, and Guojiahe in six routes, heading here!" Comrade Luo Houfu immediately supplied the intelligence to the Red Twenty-Fifth Army, enabling them to deploy their troops. They took the initiative to attack one route of the enemy, won a victory, and retreated without any losses. On another occasion, thanks to the guidance of the masses, Luo Houfu led a platoon to break through the encirclement of two regular companies and a self-defense squadron of the enemy through a small path used by woodcutters, when they were only a hundred meters away from the enemy.

　　In Huang'an, Macheng, and Lishan, along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and in the Hekou area, every village had his "home" among the poor and hired peasants. Even during the tightest "suppression" by the enemy in 1934, they were once surrounded by eight or nine regiments of the enemy's regular army. The guerrillas quickly dispersed into the villages, and Luo Houfu hid in the homes of farmers Tao Xinghe and Xiong Jianxi in Fajiahe, relying on them to closely grasp intelligence. When the enemy's situation eased slightly, they slept in the morning and came out in the afternoon; when the enemy's situation was tight, they lay low. Several times, the "militia" drank wine in the main room, and he listened to them talking in the back room. When the enemy came in to search, Tao Xinghe's sister and wife hid Luo Houfu behind the mosquito net, and they themselves slept in the net. On an even more tense occasion, Sun, the monk of the Longwangshan Temple in Huang'an, dug a cellar and sheltered him for several days. They also used the relationships of poor and hired peasants to disintegrate the internal fortifications of the Kuomintang. The insurgent poor and hired peasant soldiers killed their reactionary superiors and transformed the fortifications. The soldiers fired shots into the sky during the day and sheltered the guerrillas at night, and supplied the guerrillas with bullets and grain. The remaining enemies in the fortifications shrunk into their turtle shells and dared not move. At the slightest sound of footsteps, they fired wildly, causing the artillery fire to be connected for dozens of miles, and everyone was on edge. The Party's call to "do a good job under the white flag" was realized.

　　With the support of the masses, they became an invincible force. The Kuomintang reactionaries repeatedly spread rumors: "Luo Houfu has been captured alive, and the Communists have been killed." But a few days later, Luo Houfu's guerrilla team appeared again. Either the guerrillas annihilated another regiment of the enemy, or they annihilated another battalion. The local bandits and bullies trembled in fear and had to shrink back the bloody claws they had stretched out to the masses. The masses told each other joyfully: "The Red Army is still here!"

　　In 1939, General Li Xiannian returned to the Dabie Mountains. Comrade Luo Houfu's guerrilla force excitedly welcomed their leader and was reorganized into the Sixth Detachment of the New Fourth Army, becoming a component of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. In that same year, the Sixth Detachment, with only sixty or seventy guns, unexpectedly pounced on the puppet army Jin Longzhang's unit stationed in Caidian between Xiaogan and Huangpi, defeating ten thousand puppet troops, besieging the puppet army headquarters, capturing the puppet army commander, brigade commander, and regimental commander alive, and forcing most of the puppet troops to surrender. They seized a large number of weapons, armed themselves, and greatly increased the masses' confidence in the War of Resistance. The masses not only sent intelligence and grain to support them, but also joined the ranks of the War of Resistance in large numbers. Soon, the Sixth Detachment captured counties such as Yichang, Baokang, Zhushan, and Nanzhang. Scattered soldiers of the defeated Kuomintang reactionary army flocked to join the New Fourth Army. Under the leadership of General Li Xiannian, the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army grew to 20,000 in less than two years.

　　Comrade Luo Houfu, who had persisted in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains for a long time and was familiar with and loved by the people of the Dabie Mountains, accepted the new task given to him by the Party in 1943 and opened up the Jianghan Anti-Japanese Base Area. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, he once again cooperated with the Liu-Deng army and persisted in the arduous and difficult struggle in the Dabie Mountains, and finally cooperated with the southward army to achieve the victory of the liberation of the entire province of Hubei.

　　Comrade Luo Houfu, who has consistently persisted in the revolutionary struggle for more than 20 years, starting from the most difficult and dark times, was elected as a representative to the First National People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Hubei Military Region, and is now the Minister of the Cadre Management Department of the Hubei Military Region, continuing to defend the interests of the people of Hubei.

　　坚持大别山革命斗争的一面光荣旗帜
　　张若嘉
    远在一九二七年，大别山地区的黄安、麻城两县农民，在当地共产党人郑位三等同志领导下，举行了武装起义。革命风暴顿时席卷大别山。一九二九年，黄安佛塔寺一个贫农的儿子，十九岁的罗厚福便参加了赤卫队。第二年，他参加了共产党和红军。
    在农民起义下，红军迅速地发展起来。一九二九年，他们建立了鄂豫皖工农政府。两年后鄂豫皖革命根据地便发展到三百万人口，红军发展到六万人，他们粉碎了反革命军队的五次围攻。红军第四方面军和红军第二十五军在一九三二年和一九三四年先后离开了根据地，剩下游击部队（后来编为红军第二十八军）继续在原地坚持。罗厚福同志便是遵照党的指示，始终坚持了大别山武装革命斗争的共产党员之一。
    彻底的土地改革和政治翻身，给罗厚福和别的农民战士上了阶级教育的第一课；阶级敌人的血腥屠杀给他们上了第二课。主力走后，他们离开了自己分得的田地和房屋。罗厚福同志带着几个人，转到麻城七里岗，一下子就扑灭敌人三十多名。
    敌人对革命根据地实行了“并村”，将山地居民赶到平原，企图将大别山变成“无人区”，并割断游击队和群众的联系。为了困死游击队，匪军在春夏砍光了山上的树木和草丛，冬天放火烧山。大路小路遍布碉堡，每座平房驻着国民党反动军队和豪绅地主的“民团”。
    一九三三年，罗厚福率领的四五十人的游击队在孝感花园一带活动时被敌人打散了。他焦急地到麻城去向党请示。在那里他见到了党在鄂豫皖的领导人郑位三同志。党研究了新形势下鄂豫皖武装斗争的特殊条件——强大敌人包围下的孤立地区，缺乏根据地，缺乏大队伍的配合，提出了明确的方针任务：“坚持就是胜利”。党并总结和提高了当地武装斗争的好经验，提出采用便衣队形式，“政治活动依靠原来的群众基础，军事活动昼伏夜动”，“要在白色恐怖下建立群众基础”，“做好白旗下的工作”等群众工作路线和政治口号。
    罗厚福领到了七条驳壳枪、两元银洋，更重要的是获得了方向、信心和勇气。他又回到自己熟悉的地方，整理好自己的仅有四个人的队伍，分头发展革命势力。
    这时，在敌人封锁下，他们吃的是野菜、树皮和南瓜，三四个月和油盐绝缘。为了隐蔽目标，他们白天不冒烟，夜里不举火，将走过的山路用枯枝和树叶掩盖。当山树烧光时，他们就隐蔽到山洞里；冬天，穿三层夏布当棉衣，用破布包脚代替鞋袜。但困难越多，他们的活动越积极，罗厚福一面打游击，一面组织了中共区委会，努力发展党的组织，并建立了人民自己的政权。
    不堪敌人压迫的农民纷纷涌进了游击队。从豫南到鄂南，从西大山到东大山，他们建立了二百多个从三五十人到七八十人的小游击队。罗厚福同志领导下的游击区域，扩大到商城、固始、光山、礼山、罗山、麻城、新县、黄安一带，游击队人数发展成一个游击师。他们夜晚出来组织群众，打土豪，白天隐蔽在老君山、天台山里。
    鄂豫皖人民用充满敬爱和革命乐观主义的民歌，这样歌唱在艰苦环境下顽强无畏的自己的游击队：
    “高山石板党员的床，（群众将游击队都叫成党员）
    青枝绿叶党员的房，
    红芋花生党员的粮。
    ……”
    当回忆到这些事时，罗厚福同志笑了，他说：“这个时期当然比较艰苦，但，只要有群众就有办法。”
    相信群众、联系群众、坚决执行党的群众工作路线，是罗厚福同志显著的特点之一。因此，虽然在白色恐怖笼罩下，被敌人赶走的群众大部分又回到游击区来了，党又在许多村里建立了群众组织。
    那正是敌人威吓群众“通‘匪’不报的满门杀绝”的时候，是敌人逼迫群众“见了游击队要打锣吆喝”的时候。一九三三年的一天，新县卡房镇正驻着红军第二十五军的一个团。半夜，雇工罗以居赶了二十多里山路给罗厚福送情报来：“敌人好几个团，已从七里坪、发家河、禹王城、黄陂店、宣化店、郭家河六路出动，向这里来了！”罗厚福同志立即将情报供给红军第二十五军，使他们能够部署队伍。他们一面主动出击敌人的一路，打了胜仗，一面撤退，部队毫无损失。另一次，由于有群众带路，罗厚福带着一个排从砍柴小路突出了敌人两个正规连和一个自卫中队的包围，当时距敌人只有一百米。
    在黄安、麻城、礼山，在京汉铁路边，在河口一带，每个村庄的贫雇农中都有他的“家”。就在一九三四年敌人“清剿”最紧时，一次他们被敌人正规军八九个团包围住了。游击队迅速分散到村子里，罗厚福隐蔽到发家河农民陶兴和与熊见喜家，依靠他们密切掌握了情报。敌情稍松一点，他们就上午睡觉下午出动；敌情紧时，就潜伏下来。好几次“民团”在堂屋喝酒，他在后屋听他们说话。敌人进来搜索了，陶兴和的妹妹和老婆将罗厚福掩蔽在蚊帐后面，她们自己睡在帐里。更紧张的一次，黄安龙王山和尚庙的孙和尚挖了地洞，掩护了他好几天。他们更通过贫雇农民的关系，瓦解国民党的碉堡内部。起义的贫雇农士兵干掉自己的反动上司，将碉堡变了质。士兵们白天朝天放枪，夜里掩护游击队，并供给游击队子弹和粮食。其余碉堡里的敌人缩躲在乌龟壳里不敢动，一听到脚步声便胡乱开炮，弄得几十里路炮火相连，草木皆兵。党所号召的“做好白旗下的工作”实现了。
    在群众支援下，他们成了永不可战胜的队伍。国民党反动派好几次造谣：“罗厚福被活捉了，共产党员被杀光了。”但几天之后，罗厚福的游击队又出现了。游击队不是又歼灭了敌人一个团，便是又歼灭他一个营。土匪恶霸心惊胆战，不得不收缩一下他们伸向群众的血爪。群众则喜洋洋地互相告诉：“红军还在这里！”
    一九三九年，李先念将军回到了大别山。罗厚福同志的游击队兴奋地迎接了自己的领导人，并被编为新四军第六大队，成为以后的新四军五师的一个组成部分。就在那年，第六大队以六七十条枪，出敌不意地猛扑驻在孝感黄陂间蔡店的伪军金龙章部，打垮了一万名伪军，一举包围伪军军部，活捉了伪军长、旅长和团长，迫使大部分伪军投降。他们缴获了大批武器，武装了自己，并且大大提高了群众的抗战信心。群众不仅送情报、送粮食来支援他们，而且大批地参加了抗日的行列。不久，六大队打下了宜昌、保康、竹山、南漳等县。溃逃的国民党反动军队的流散士兵，纷纷跑来参加新四军。在李先念将军领导下，新四军五师不到两年便发展到两万人。
    长期坚持了大别山斗争，为大别山人民熟悉和热爱的罗厚福同志，在一九四三年接受党给他的新任务，开辟了江汉抗日根据地。在第三次国内革命战争时期，他又配合刘邓大军，再度坚持了大别山区的严酷艰苦的斗争，最终配合南下大军，取得了湖北全省解放的胜利。
    二十多年来，从最艰苦和黑暗的时候起，始终坚持革命斗争的罗厚福同志，一九四九年，被推选为第一届全国人民政协的代表，曾任湖北军区副参谋长，现在是湖北军区干部管理部部长，继续捍卫着湖北人民的利益。（节自长江日报）
