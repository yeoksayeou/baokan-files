　　Mandatory Insurance for Railway, Ship, and Airplane Passengers
    to be Fully Implemented from July 1st
    The People's Insurance Company of China will fully implement accident insurance for railway, ship, and airplane passengers from July 1st.

    After consultation between the People's Insurance Company of China and the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government, the Civil Aviation Administration, and the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Corporation, it was decided that railway and airplane passenger insurance would be implemented from July 1st. The implementation date for ship passenger insurance will not be uniformly stipulated, but will be handled separately by local People's Insurance Companies and shipping companies, but not later than July 1st. The scope of implementation: Railway passenger insurance will be implemented on all lines nationwide, except for suburban traffic trains of railway bureaus (mainly for the railway bureau's own use, sometimes with passengers). Ship passenger insurance will be implemented on all state-owned, publicly-owned, joint public-private, and private ships; ferries will be postponed. For ships going abroad, the scope is limited to commercial port terminals within the country, but if shipping companies have the conditions to handle survey, review, and payment matters on behalf of the insurance company, it can also be extended to foreign countries. Airplane passenger insurance will be fully implemented on domestic routes, and full coverage will be provided for the entire outbound journey on international routes. Return trips from foreign stations will not be insured for the time being, but those boarding within China will be insured.

    The insured amount for all types of passenger insurance is uniformly stipulated at 15 million yuan per person. The insurance premium is calculated as a percentage of the ticket price (excluding express fees, sleeper fees, meal fees, etc.) for various seats, berths, and cabins, namely 2% for railways, 3% for ships, and 0.5% for airplanes. Passengers traveling free of charge as stipulated by transportation agencies are exempt from insurance premiums; passengers with half-price and preferential tickets are charged according to the actual ticket price. If a passenger suffers injury due to an external, violent, and obvious accidental event (including those caused by war) during the insurance validity period, the transportation agency will provide treatment on behalf of the People's Insurance Company, with a treatment subsidy not exceeding 15 million yuan. If a passenger unfortunately dies, becomes disabled, or loses bodily function, the People's Insurance Company will pay insurance benefits in accordance with regulations. Treatment subsidies are not deducted from the insurance benefits.
