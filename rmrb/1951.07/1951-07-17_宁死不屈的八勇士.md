　　The Eight Heroes Who Would Rather Die Than Surrender
    (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhao Pu)
    The brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers often say: "We are the great Chinese people!" This proud statement fully expresses the infinite pride and glory of being a brave, hardworking, and invincible Chinese people. The heroic deeds of the eight volunteer warriors in the Tieyuan area are a manifestation of this magnificent spirit of the Chinese people.
    These eight warriors are: Li Bingqun, Deputy Platoon Leader and member of the Chinese Communist Party; soldiers He Chengyu, Qu Guoling, Cui Xuecai, Zhang Qiuchang, Meng Qingxiu; and non-Party soldiers Hou Tianyou and Luo Juncheng. They belong to the "Special Merits Platoon" of the Steel Battalion of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. This platoon had previously achieved brilliant victories in the battle to annihilate the 29th British Brigade in late April. Within an hour and a half, they destroyed seven enemy tanks, one armored vehicle, one car, and two jeeps, killed and wounded more than fifty enemy officers and soldiers, and captured fifty-nine enemies alive.
    On June 5th, the eight warriors of the "Special Merits Platoon," led by Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun, were tasked with defending the Beishan position in Fahua Cave, more than forty miles southwest of Tieyuan. This mountain is about 250 meters high, with a peak width of more than ten meters and a length of more than sixty meters, densely covered with green pines and cypresses. The east and north sides of the mountain peak are cliffs, the northwest is connected to the 535 Heights occupied by the enemy by a ridge about three miles long, and the south faces the enemy. The eight warriors, who had been fighting continuously for several nights, accepted this arduous task. They were to defend this mountain peak with enemies on two sides and cliffs on the other two sides, control a gully to the left, and cooperate with friendly neighboring units to annihilate the enemy.
    The eight heroes worked overnight to build fortifications. They had just sat down and grabbed a handful of dry fried noodles to eat when the enemy began shelling. The battle-hardened warriors knew how to protect themselves under the enemy's heavy artillery fire. The enemy's shells destroyed the pine forest and shattered the rocks, but did not injure a single hair on the eight warriors.
    At nine o'clock in the morning, the enemy's shelling stopped. An enemy battalion attacked the hilltop. They climbed up, clinging to trees and rocks, panting like cows. The warriors, who were waiting in battle formation on the top of the mountain, waited until the enemy climbed to within thirty meters of the top of the mountain, and suddenly attacked the enemy with grenades, machine guns, and submachine guns, killing more than thirty enemies. The remaining enemies dragged their dead bodies and rolled down the mountain.
    The enemy routinely shelled again. The warriors quickly loaded their bullets, then sat leisurely in the fortifications, took out the "cigarette paper" delivered by the enemy planes (this is the name the soldiers gave to the ridiculous leaflets dropped by the enemy planes), rolled up yellow tobacco and smoked.
    While smoking, everyone discussed their plans to strive for even greater merit. Just as they were talking enthusiastically, the enemy infantry began to stir again, and the enemy on the 535 Heights on the rear right also began to press forward. Facing the enemy's pincer attack, Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun issued an order to his comrades: "Fight resolutely! Open fire together when the enemy gets within twenty meters!" An enemy force of more than a battalion surrounded the warriors from the south, west, and northwest directions. Faced with an enemy dozens of times their size, the warriors fought even more bravely and tenaciously. Communist Party member He Chengyu jumped out of the fortifications, carrying a machine gun to fight alone against the enemy pressing from the northwest, while the remaining warriors used grenades and submachine guns to meet the bandits climbing from other directions. The warriors shouted as they fought: "Come on up if you have the guts!" None of the enemies dared to rush up and were beaten back to the hillside, panting. The warriors took the opportunity to check their bullets. None of the eight had more than fifteen rounds left, and there were only a few grenades left. Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun said solemnly to his comrades: "We don't have many bullets left. One bullet must take down one enemy. When we run out, we will jump off the cliff! The great Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers would rather die than surrender!" The warriors, with a high degree of political consciousness, responded in unison: "Steel warriors, would rather die than surrender!" "We want to live great and die gloriously!"
    The enemy spent half an hour dragging more than fifty dead bodies down the mountain slope, and then used two battalions to launch a third attack. The warriors cherished the few bullets they had left, truly taking down one enemy with each shot. The enemy continued to charge upwards, and Li Bingqun and Hou Tianyou threw out the last two anti-tank mines. In the thunderous sound, a group of enemies were blown down, and the remaining enemies lay down on the hillside, not daring to move. The warriors took the opportunity to move to the cliff behind them. Soon, the enemy rushed up, and the warriors pointed their empty guns at the enemy, scaring the enemies into lying down again. At this time, behind the warriors was a five-zhang (approx. 16.4 meters) high cliff. Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun ordered Communist Party member Qu Guoling, and non-Party soldiers Hou Tianyou and Luo Juncheng to serve as cover. Then, he issued the final order: "The great Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers would rather die than surrender! Comrades, jump!" Communist Party member He Chengyu hugged his machine gun and took a last look at the enemy in front of him with hatred, and jumped off the cliff without hesitation. Immediately afterwards, Communist Party members Cui Xuecai, Zhang Qiuchang, and Meng Qingxiu also jumped down. An American soldier rushed up with an automatic rifle, trying to capture Hou Tianyou alive. This strong and determined Chinese man ended the dog's life of this American devil with the last bullet. Then he and the other two warriors jumped off the cliff with Deputy Platoon Leader Li Bingqun.
    In six hours of bloody battle, the warriors killed more than a hundred American devils.
    Of the eight heroes, Qu Guoling, Hou Tianyou, and Luo Juncheng survived the jump because they were caught by the dense branches under the cliff. That night, they made their way, wounded, through the enemy's blockade and returned to their own troops. They firmly stated: "As long as we have a breath left, we will fight the enemy to the end!"
    Glory to the fallen martyrs! The living heroes will be victorious forever!

### 宁死不屈的八勇士

　　宁死不屈的八勇士
    （新华社记者赵普）
    中国人民志愿军的勇士们常常说：“我们是伟大的中国人民！”在这句自豪的话里面，充分表露了作为勇敢勤劳、不可战胜的中国人民的无限骄傲与光荣之感。而在铁原地区所发生的志愿军八位勇士的壮烈事迹，正就是中国人民这种气壮山河的英雄气概的表现。
    这八位勇士是：中国共产党党员副排长李秉群，战士何成玉、瞿过灵、崔学才、张秋昌、孟庆修，非党战士侯天佑、罗俊成。他们是属于志愿军某部钢铁营“特功排”的。这个排在四月下旬痛歼英军二十九旅的战斗中，曾经创造了光辉的战绩。他们在一个半钟头之内，击毁敌人坦克七辆、装甲车一辆、汽车一辆和吉普车两辆，打死打伤敌人官兵五十多名，活捉敌人五十九名。
    六月五日，“特功排”的八位勇士在副排长李秉群率领下，担任了守卫铁原西南四十余里处的法化洞北山阵地的任务。这个山高约二百五十公尺，山顶宽十多公尺，长六十多公尺，上面密布苍松翠柏。山峰的东面和北面是悬崖，西北有一条约三里长的山岭，连接着敌人盘踞的五三五高地，南面是与敌对峙的正面。连续战斗了几夜的八位勇士，接受了这个艰巨的任务，他们要据守这两面临敌、两面是悬崖的山峰，控制左面的一个沟口，配合友邻部队歼灭敌人。
    八勇士连夜赶筑好了工事，刚刚坐下来抓了两把干炒面往口里送，敌人就开始炮击了。身经百战的勇士们是懂得怎样在敌人猛烈炮火下保存自己的。敌人的炮弹毁掉了松林，炸裂了岩石，可是没有伤到八勇士的一根汗毛。
    早上九点钟，敌人的炮击停止。敌步兵一个营向山头进攻。他们攀树附石，气喘如牛地向上爬。在山顶上严阵以待的勇士们等到敌人爬到距山头只三十多公尺时，突然以手榴弹、机关枪、冲锋枪向敌人猛炸猛扫，打死敌人三十多，其余的敌人倒拖着死尸滚下山去了。
    敌人照例地再打一阵炮。勇士们迅速地装好子弹，然后安闲地坐在工事里，拿出敌机运来的“卷烟纸”（这是战士们给敌机撒下的荒谬传单取的名称），卷好黄烟吸起来。
    大家一面吸烟，一面谈着自己争取功上加功的计划。正谈得起劲的时候，敌人步兵又开始蠢动了，右侧后五三五高地上的敌人也开始压过来。面对着敌人的夹击，李秉群副排长对他的战友们发出了命令：“坚决打！等敌人接近到二十公尺时一齐开火！”一个营以上兵力的敌人从南、西、西北三个方向向勇士们包围过来。面对着数十倍于自己的优势敌人，勇士们打得更加勇猛顽强。共产党员何成玉跳出工事，端着机关枪独战从西北面压过来的敌人，其余的勇士以手榴弹和冲锋枪迎击从其他方向爬过来的匪徒们。勇士们一面打一面喊：“有种的给我上来吧！”敌人都没有敢冲上来，被打得退在半山腰喘气。勇士们乘机检查了一下子弹，八个人中没有一个人超过十五粒，手榴弹也只有几颗了。李秉群副排长严肃地对他的战友们说：“子弹不多了。一个子弹要打倒一个敌人，打完了我们就跳崖！伟大的中国人民志愿军战士是宁死不屈的！”具有高度政治觉悟的勇士们同声应道：“钢铁战士，宁死不屈！”“我们要生得伟大，死得光荣！”
    敌人费了半个多钟头时间，把山坡上的五十多具死尸拖下山，然后使用了两个营的兵力，发起第三次冲锋。勇士们珍惜地使用着仅有的几粒子弹，真是一枪打一个。敌人继续往上冲，李秉群和侯天佑扔出了最后两颗反坦克雷。在霹雳声中，敌人被炸倒了一片，其余的敌人卧倒在山坡上不敢动弹，勇士们乘机向身后悬崖移动。不久，敌人涌上来了，勇士们端起空枪对准敌人，吓得敌人又赶紧卧倒。这时勇士们背后就是五丈高的悬崖，李秉群副排长命令党员瞿过灵、非党战士侯天佑、罗俊成等三人担任掩护。然后，他发出了最后的命令：“伟大的中国人民志愿军战士宁死不屈！同志们：跳啊！”共产党员何成玉抱着机关枪，用充满仇恨的眼光最后看了一下面前的敌人，毫不犹豫地跳下了悬崖。紧接着共产党员崔学才、张秋昌、孟庆修也都跳了下去。一个美国兵端着自动步枪冲上来，妄想活捉打掩护的侯天佑。这个身强力壮、意志如钢的中华男儿，用最后一粒子弹结束了这个美国鬼子的狗命。然后他和其他两个勇士一起随着李秉群副排长跳下悬崖。
    勇士们在六小时血战中，共打死了一百多个美国鬼子。
    八勇士中的瞿过灵、侯天佑、罗俊成等三勇士，跳崖以后，因为被崖下丛密的树枝托住，所以没有牺牲。他们在晚上带着伤穿过敌人的封锁，又回到自己的队伍中来了。他们坚决表示：“我们只要还有一口气，就要和敌人战斗到底！”
    牺牲了的烈士们永垂不朽！活着的英雄们将永远胜利！
