Introducing "Commemorative Publication of the National Congress of Combat Heroes"
Published by People's Publishing House, Hardcover Edition Priced at 100,000 Yuan

The materials from the National Congress of Combat Heroes held in Beijing last September have been compiled by the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission into a commemorative publication. The entire book is printed with heavy-weight coated paper, with dozens of photographs and exquisite binding. The inner front and back covers feature four sculptures of People's Liberation Army soldiers, revealing the heroic spirit of the People's Liberation Army. The first and second pages before the text feature the solemn and majestic national emblem and flag. The third page features a beautiful "August 1st" five-pointed star design, and the fourth page features the fluttering military flag. Following are portraits and inscriptions of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou, and the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Congress spanning two pages.

According to Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions, the task of this congress was to continue to promote the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism. In this way, "our army can be called a truly steel-like, invincible army. With such an army, we can ensure the peace and happiness of the Chinese people until the final elimination of war."

In the typical reports of the heroes, we saw many model and great deeds worthy of the revolutionary military struggle of the people of the world. For example, the courageous hero Liu Sihu once charged into the enemy's position alone and, surrounded by the enemy, used excellent bayonet skills to stab seven enemies to death. Militia hero Zhe Duoxiong joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1928 and fought under the leadership of the Party for 22 years, once capturing eight enemies single-handedly and seizing four guns. Li Changlin, who had served in the army for 17 years, was one of the famous heroes of the 25,000-mile Long March. During the People's Liberation War, he once annihilated an enemy division with two battalions and captured the enemy division commander alive. Wu Tiancai, a machine gunner of the Asi ethnic group in Yunnan, was a heroic model of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines during the People's Liberation War. He once led two militiamen and defeated dozens of enemies in an encounter. Shooting hero Wei Laiguo once eliminated 110 enemies with 120 bullets in a battle. Ta-shan hero Bao Renchuan was a participant in the famous Ta-shan blocking battle. He used a battalion to continuously block the enemy's large army for six days and nights. He also forced two companies of the enemy to surrender.

Following the heroes' deeds are the photographs of 352 heroes, which truly show the resolute, brave, and confident heroic spirit of the People's Liberation Army soldiers. In these photos, we see the old militia hero Bian Hailu, who is sixty years old, and also the representatives of brave Chinese women: Guo Junqing, Li Landing, Liu Hucheng, and Sun Yumin, and also heroes from various ethnic minorities: Ladonorov, Wu Tiancai, Lin Zhiqing, Chen Liwen, and Hao Tielao.

The last part of the book is the congress's dynamics. The photography and text here fully demonstrate the love and respect of the people across the country for the heroes, and also fully demonstrate the heroes' firm will to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

    去年九月在北京举行的全国战斗英雄代表会议的材料，已由人民革命军事委员会总政治部编成纪念刊出版。全书一律用重磅道林纸精印，附照像数十幅，装帧精美。封面里页和封底里页有四幅人民解放军战士塑像，显出了人民解放军的英雄气质。文前首页和第二页是庄严而雄伟的国徽和国旗，第三页是美丽的“八一”五角星图案，第四页是迎风招展的军旗，以下是毛主席、朱总司令、刘副主席、周总理的像片和题字，和用两页连成的中国共产党中央对大会的祝词。
    这次大会的任务，按照朱总司令的指示，就是继续发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神。这样，“我们的部队就称得起是一支真正钢铁般的、无敌的部队。有了这样一支部队，我们就能确保中国人民的和平与幸福，直至最后消灭战争。”
    在英雄们的典型报告中，我们看到了许多堪称为全世界人民革命军事斗争的模范伟大事迹。例如浑身是胆的英雄刘四虎，曾经只身冲入敌人阵地，在敌人包围下用优秀的刺击技术刺死七个敌人。民兵英雄折多雄从一九二八年加入中国共产党，在党的领导下奋战了二十二年，曾经独身俘敌八人，缴枪四枝。参军十七年的李长林，是二万五千里长征中有名的英雄之一，在人民解放战争中，曾经用两个营的兵力歼灭敌人一个师，活捉敌人师长。云南阿西族机枪手武天才，是人民解放战争中敌后游击战争的英雄典型，他曾经带着两个民兵，在一次遭遇战中打败几十个敌人。射击英雄魏来国，在一次战役中，曾经用一百二十粒子弹消灭一百一十个敌人。塔山英雄鲍仁川，是有名的塔山阻击战的参加者。他竟以一个营的兵力，连续六昼夜对敌人的大兵团进行了阻击战。还强迫敌人的两个连投了降。
    在英雄们的事迹之后，是三百五十二名英雄的像片，这些像片的确地显示了人民解放军战士的坚决、勇敢、充满自信心的英雄气概。在这些照像中，我们看到了有六十高龄的民兵老英雄边海禄，也看到了勇敢的中国妇女的代表人物：郭俊卿、李蓝丁、刘虎城、孙玉敏，还看到了各少数民族中的英雄：拉多诺夫、武天才、林志清、陈理文、好特老。
    本书的最后一部分是大会动态，这里的摄影和文字，充分说明了全国人民对英雄们的热爱和尊敬，也充分说明了英雄们的保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的坚定的意志。
