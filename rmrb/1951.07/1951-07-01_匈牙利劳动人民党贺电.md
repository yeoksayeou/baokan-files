To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing, dear comrades:
    On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we extend our heartfelt communist greetings in the name of the Hungarian Working People's Party and all the Hungarian people.
    Thirty years ago, inspired by the great thoughts of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party of China raised the banner of the Chinese people's long struggle for freedom and led the Chinese people to victory, thus giving the imperialist system a new and fatal blow. We, together with the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese brother party, celebrate this anniversary. We admire and watch the struggle of China to achieve prosperity, a struggle that has achieved successive victories under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. We watch with warm sympathy the heroic battle waged by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people side by side on Korean soil against the shameless aggression of the US imperialism against the freedom of all peoples. We assure you in the name of the Hungarian people that, as a loyal member of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, we will continue to fight unremittingly for the victory of the sacred cause of freedom and peace.
                           Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party
                                    Budapest, June 29

　　匈牙利劳动人民党贺电北京中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    值此中国共产党成立三十周年纪念之际，我们谨以匈牙利劳动人民党以及全体匈牙利人民的名义致以衷心的共产主义的祝贺。
    三十年前，中国共产党被列宁、斯大林的伟大思想所鼓舞，举起了中国人民长年争取自由的旗帜并领导中国人民走向胜利，因而给予帝国主义体系以新的、致命的打击。我们和伟大的中国人民以及光荣的中国兄弟党一起来庆祝这个纪念日。我们欣佩地注视中国争取繁荣的斗争，这一斗争在中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志领导下取得节节的胜利。我们怀着热烈的同情注视中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民在朝鲜国土上并肩进行英勇的战斗，反对美帝国主义对各国人民的自由的无耻进攻。我们谨以匈牙利人民的名义向你们保证：作为苏联所领导的和平阵营的忠实成员，我们也要继续不懈地斗争，以争取自由、和平神圣事业的胜利。
                           匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西
                                    六月二十九日于布达佩斯
