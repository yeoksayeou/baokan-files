　　Violating International Agreements and Treaty Procedures
    U.S. Government Illegally Unilaterally Decides
    To Hold "Peace Conference with Japan" in Early September
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] Disregarding international agreements and the wishes of peace-loving people worldwide, the U.S. government has unilaterally decided to convene a so-called "peace conference with Japan" in early September and illegally sign a separate peace treaty with Japan.

    On the 6th, San Francisco Mayor Robinson announced that he had received a notification from Dulles stating that San Francisco had been selected as the location for the formal signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan, and that the "peace conference" would be held from September 4th to 8th. On the same day, U.S. State Department Press Officer White also confirmed this unilateral decision by the United States.

    In order to actively arrange this illegal "peace conference," according to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, Dulles has begun distributing the "revised" U.S.-drafted peace treaty with Japan to the other twelve countries of the Far Eastern Commission, as well as Indonesia, Ceylon, and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, starting on the 5th. U.S. officials revealed that the so-called "revised draft" is "largely" the same as the original draft.

    The "peace conference" unilaterally decided upon by the United States not only completely violates the treaty procedures stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and the decision in the 1942 United Nations Declaration regarding not making separate peace with enemy countries, but is also an insult to other countries. According to the U.S. plan, this conference will only last four days and is "completely a formality" (Associated Press). This means that the purpose of the United States in convening this conference is only to have those countries attending the conference sign and endorse the separate peace treaty with Japan that the United States has arranged single-handedly.

　　违反国际协议与和约程序
    美政府非法片面决定
    九月初开“对日和会”
    【新华社十日讯】美国政府不顾国际协议与世界爱好和平人民的意愿，已片面地决定在九月初召开所谓“对日和会”，非法地签订单独对日和约。
    六日，美国旧金山市长罗宾逊宣布：他接到杜勒斯的通知说，旧金山已被选为正式签订单独对日和约的地点，“和会”日期是九月四日到八日。同日，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特也证实了这一美国片面的决定。
    为了积极布置这一非法的“和会”，据美联社华盛顿消息，杜勒斯已从五日开始将“修正”过的美制对日和约草案分发给远东委员会的其他十二个国家以及印尼、锡兰和李承晚傀儡政权。美国官员透露：所谓“修正草案”与原来的草案“大体上”相同。
    美国片面地决定召开的“和会”，不仅完全违背波茨坦协定所规定的和约程序和一九四二年元旦联合国家共同宣言关于不与敌国单独媾和的决定，而且是对其他国家的一种污辱。按照美国的计划，这次会议历时仅仅四天，“完全是一种仪式”（美联社）。这就是说，美国召开这次会议的目的，仅是让那些参加会议的国家在美国一手包办的单独对日和约上签字画押而已。
