Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: U.S. imperialism is increasingly blatantly interfering in Iran's oil issue. On July 9th, Truman wrote a second letter to Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh, demanding that the Iranian government "abide by" the International Court's decision on the Iranian oil issue. Truman also said that he proposed sending his closest advisor on foreign affairs, Harriman, to Tehran to resolve the oil issue. In the letter, Truman once again threatened Mossadegh, saying that the current oil "crisis" endangers the entire "free world" (i.e., the imperialist bloc). He demanded that the Iranian government find a way to maintain "British technology."

Following the dispatch of Truman's letter, the U.S. government is using even more shameless intimidation against Iran. According to an AFP dispatch from Washington on July 10th, quoting U.S. government sources, if the Iranian government refuses to reach an agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the U.S. will support Britain in "whatever steps it takes to restore the original situation and maintain its prestige in the Middle East." Both the U.S. and Britain believe that the Iranian oil issue is now a "matter beyond the scope of the oil issue," and is a matter of "the prestige of Britain and the United States in the entire Middle East." The dispatch therefore said that Truman's letter is "the greatest effort on the part of the United States to get Iran to participate in the Western democratic bloc (i.e., the imperialist bloc)."

　　美对伊施用无耻恫吓
    杜鲁门致函伊朗首相摩萨台
    要胁伊朗屈从国际法庭非法决定
    【新华社十四日讯】美帝国主义更益露骨地干涉伊朗的石油问题。七月九日，杜鲁门第二次写信给伊朗首相摩萨台，要求伊朗政府“遵守”国际法庭对伊朗石油问题的决定。杜鲁门并说，他提议派遣他最亲密的外交问题顾问哈里曼到德黑兰去解决石油问题。杜鲁门在信里再次威胁摩萨台说：目前的石油“危机”，危害着整个“自由世界”（按即帝国主义集团）。他要求伊朗政府设法保持“英国的技术”。
    美国官方在杜鲁门的信发出后，正对伊朗使用更无耻的恫吓。据法新社华盛顿十日电引美国政府人士的话说：如果伊朗政府拒绝和英伊石油公司获致协议，美国就要支持英国“为了恢复原来的情况并保持它在中东的威望而采取的不论什么步骤”。美国和英国方面都认为伊朗的石油问题现在已是“超乎石油问题范围之外的问题”，是“英国和美国在整个中东的威望问题”。该电因此说，杜鲁门的信是“美国方面力求伊朗参加西方民主集团（按即帝国主义集团）的最大努力”。
