Two parents of students joining the military cadre schools also spoke words of farewell. Ye Xiuzhen, the sixty-five-year-old mother of Ye Shuhui from Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "I love my child very much, but I love the beautiful motherland even more. It is also our glory as mothers that our children can embark on glorious posts under the new education!" Xuan Ning, the father of Xuan Tong from Hebei High School, said: "We must be completely loyal to the motherland and our government. Now that the motherland calls you to join the military cadre school, I say: Go, child! Don't be attached to the family, and serve the people wholeheartedly!" Six students joining the military cadre schools expressed their determination to defend the motherland at the meeting, vowing not to fail the glory and expectations given by the people of the motherland. Wang Wencuan, a member of the Communist Youth League from Peking University, said: "I have discarded all bourgeois ideas. I have only one future and one cause before me, and that is the cause of revolution. I will study diligently, advance bravely, overcome all difficulties, and train myself into a steel fighter and a loyal son and daughter of the motherland in the revolutionary ranks!" The rally concluded with a performance of artistic programs by the Military Commission's Cultural Troupe to send off these students heading to their glorious posts.
