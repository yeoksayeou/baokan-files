Criticism of Shortcomings is Not the Same as Negating Achievements; Avoiding Mention of Shortcomings is an Obstacle to Improving Work – Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong's Letter

After reading Comrade Chen Yougong's letter in the People's Daily on July 10th, we have the following points to make:

I. Comrade Chen Yougong believes that criticizing shortcomings in basic construction work is the same as negating the achievements in basic construction work. This understanding is wrong. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China two years ago, the Party and the government have led the people of the whole country and have made great achievements in all aspects of construction work. These achievements are recognized by the people of China and the world. These achievements should be affirmed and have been affirmed. But we cannot say that with these achievements, we can ignore the shortcomings in our work. On the contrary, it is precisely because our Party has adopted an uncompromising struggle against the shortcomings in our work that we have been able to lead the people of the whole country to achieve today's great achievements. Therefore, we believe that Comrade Chen Yougong's understanding is equivalent to saying that criticizing the shortcomings or mistakes of individual Party members is the same as negating the glorious and great achievements of the Chinese Communist Party. This is unreasonable. This is tolerance of shortcomings and a distorted understanding of criticism and self-criticism.

II. Comrade Chen Yougong believes that the shortcomings in basic construction work are caused by objective difficulties. This reason is not sufficient. We admit that it is difficult to carry out construction on such a mess as old China, but when we look at the units criticized in the newspapers, are these shortcomings all caused by objective difficulties? For example, the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 4 Mine built eight workers' dormitories. Less than two months after completion, and less than a month after the workers moved in, they were all demolished because another project needed the land; the walls of the material warehouse were changed three times in less than half a year. The Taiyuan Construction Company's design for the Jinnan Flour Mill construction project did not survey whether the foundation was suitable, and blindly formulated a design, so that when the Shanxi Construction Company was building a Class B warehouse, it discovered mud water when digging 60 centimeters into the ground; the originally designed Class B staff dormitory also discovered mud water when digging less than 40 centimeters. At the same time, because the location of the above-mentioned buildings hindered the laying of railway tracks in the factory, they had to be abandoned completely, and a large number of waste bricks and rubble piled up in the factory had to be cleared again for new construction (see People's Daily, July 6th and 7th, page 2). Are these all caused by objective difficulties such as "the enterprise organization has just been established," "the budget and final accounts are extremely untimely," and "the task is heavy, the time is urgent, and the materials are even more insufficient"?

III. Comrade Chen Yougong believes that the criticism in the People's Daily is an argument of "scholars sitting in glass windows" who "do not know the difficulty of doing things," which is even more wrong. One of the characteristics of our Party is that it is closely linked to the masses. The task of the Party newspaper's criticism is to understand the situation from the masses, discover problems, and then raise problems to guide the improvement of work. It is by no means bureaucratic behavior of sitting in glass windows. Therefore, we believe that Comrade Chen Yougong's opinion is unfounded and cannot be established. This only shows Comrade Chen Yougong's misunderstanding of criticism and his confrontational emotions. If some enterprise leading cadres have the same understanding as Comrade Chen Yougong, it will seriously hinder us from overcoming the shortcomings of construction work and prevent us from achieving more and greater achievements in construction work. Therefore, we believe that Comrade Chen Yougong's thinking should be thoroughly examined and deeply reviewed.

### 批评缺点并不是抹杀成就不讳言缺点才能改进工作  ——对陈有功同志的信的意见

　　批评缺点并不是抹杀成就不讳言缺点才能改进工作
    ——对陈有功同志的信的意见
    读了七月十日人民日报上陈有功同志的信，我们有以下几点意见：
    一、陈有功同志认为批评了基本建设工作中的缺点就是抹煞了基本建设工作中的成绩，这种认识是错误的。中华人民共和国成立两年以来，党和政府领导着全国人民，在各方面的建设工作中已经取得了很大的成绩。这成绩是全中国、全世界人民所公认的，这些成绩是应该肯定也是已经肯定了的。但不能说有了这些成绩就可以忽视我们工作中的缺点。相反地，正因为我们党对工作中的缺点采取了不妥协的斗争，才能领导全国人民取得今天的伟大成绩。因此，我们认为陈有功同志的认识等于这样说：批评个别党员的缺点或错误就是抹杀中国共产党光荣伟大的成就。这样说是没有道理的。这是对缺点的容忍，对批评与自我批评的歪曲理解。
    二、陈有功同志认为基本建设工作中的缺点是由于客观困难造成的，这理由是不充足的。我们承认，在旧中国这么一个烂摊上进行建设是有困难的，但我们看看报纸上批评的单位，是不是都是由于客观困难造成了这些缺点？如阳泉矿务局四矿修建了八栋工人宿舍，竣工不到两个月，工人占用不满一月，就因另一工程需要这一块地基而全部拆除；材料库的围墙在不足半年的时间内更改三次。太原建筑公司设计之晋南面粉厂修建工程，没有勘测地基是否适用，就盲目制订图案，使山西建筑公司修建乙种仓库时，挖掘地面六十公分就发现泥水；原设计的乙种职工宿舍，挖掘不足四十公分也发现泥水。同时，又因上述建筑物地点有碍厂内铺设铁轨，只得全部被迫弃工，重新清除厂内堆积的大批废砖瓦砾，另行施工（见七月六、七日人民日报第二版），难道这些都是由于“企业组织刚刚建立”、“预算决算极不及时”“任务既重，时间又急，资材更不充裕”等客观困难造成的吗？
    三、陈有功同志认为人民日报的批评是“学者坐在玻璃窗内”，“不知事情难办”的议论，更是错误的。我们党的特点之一是紧密地联系群众，党报的批评任务是从群众中了解情况、发现问题，然后提出问题指导改进工作，决不是坐在玻璃窗内的官僚主义者。因此我们认为陈有功同志的意见是没有根据，不能成立的。这仅仅说明陈有功同志对批评的错误理解和对抗情绪。如果有一部分企业领导干部存在着像陈有功同志一样的认识，将要严重地阻碍我们克服建设工作的缺点，妨碍我们在建设工作中取得更多更大的成绩。因此我们认为陈有功同志的思想应彻底检查并进行深刻检讨。
