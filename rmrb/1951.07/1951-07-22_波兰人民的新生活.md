Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: July 22nd marks the 7th anniversary of the founding of People's Democratic Poland. Through seven years of effort, the material and cultural living standards of the Polish people have greatly improved today. In 1949, Polish workers' wages had increased by 26.6 percent compared to the pre-war year of 1938, and in 1950, they increased by another 6 percent compared to 1949. The consumption and production of consumer goods have also greatly increased. In 1949, Poland's wheat consumption had exceeded the pre-war level by 50 percent. Meat exceeded it by 19 percent, sugar by 64 percent, and wool fabrics by 55 percent. In 1950, Poland's output of meat, sugar, and cotton and woolen fabrics increased by 7 to 44 percent respectively compared to 1949, and the retail trade volume increased by 14.5 percent compared to 1949.

In the past seven years, Poland has constructed housing on a large scale. In the last year and this year alone, 170,000 new houses have been built. Workers' districts in ten industrial cities, including Lodz, Krakow, and Gdansk, are being rebuilt, and the central areas of twenty-one other cities are also being rebuilt. The living standards of farmers are also improving. By the end of last year, 12,500 villages throughout Poland had been electrified.

The working people widely enjoy the benefits of medical care and vacations. The number of health stations nationwide has increased from 482 before the war to 1,220. Before the war, Poland had an average of only two hospital beds per 1,000 people. After liberation, 7,100 hospital beds were added in 1949 alone, eight times the average annual increase before the war. This year, approximately 580,000 workers and staff are taking vacations in sanatoriums, and approximately 10 million workers and their families are enjoying the benefits of social insurance. Due to the development of health services, the birth rate is now double that of 1938.

Poland will eliminate illiteracy completely this year. The number of university students has doubled compared to pre-war levels, and the number of farmers' children entering primary and secondary schools has tripled compared to pre-war levels. By the end of 1950, there were 20,000 libraries and 5,000 amateur art groups in rural clubs throughout Poland. In 1950, 116 million books and pamphlets were published, a figure never seen before.

    【新华社二十一日讯】七月二十二日，是人民民主的波兰建国七周年纪念日。波兰人民经过七年的努力，今天的物质和文化生活水平已大为提高。波兰工人工资一九四九年已比战前一九三八年增加了百分之二十六点六，一九五○年比一九四九年又增加百分之六。消费品消费量和生产量也大为增加。一九四九年波兰的小麦消费量已超过战前百分之五十。肉类超过百分之十九，糖超过百分之六十四，毛织品超过百分之五十五。一九五○年波兰肉类、糖、棉毛织品的产量，比一九四九年分别增加百分之七到百分之四十四，零售贸易额比一九四九年增加了百分之十四点五。
    七年来波兰大规模修建了住宅。仅去年和今年，新建的房屋就达十七万间，罗兹、克拉科、革但斯克等十个工业城市的工人区都在重建中，此外还有二十一个城市的中心区在重建中。农民的生活水平也在提高，到去年年底，全波兰已有一万二千五百个乡村电气化了。
    劳动人民广泛享受着医疗和休假的福利。全国保健站从战前的四百八十二所增加到一千二百二十所。战前波兰平均每一千人只有二张病床，解放后单在一九四九年就增加了七千一百张病床，为战前每年平均增加数的八倍。今年约有五十八万职工在休养所休假，约有一千万工人和他们的家属享受到社会保险的福利。由于卫生事业的发达，现在人口出生率比一九三八年增加一倍。
    波兰的文盲今年可以全部消灭，现在大学生数目已比战前增加一倍，农民子弟进入中小学的数目增加为战前的三倍。在一九五○年底，波兰全国已有二万座图书馆，乡村俱乐部有五千个业余艺术团体。一九五○年出版的书籍和小册子达一亿一千六百万册，这是以前从来没有过的数字。
