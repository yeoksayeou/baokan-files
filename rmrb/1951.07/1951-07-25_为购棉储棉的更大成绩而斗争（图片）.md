Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Cotton Purchasing and Storage Work" on June 1st, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to launch a patriotic cotton selling and storing movement, cotton producing areas have successively carried out cotton purchasing and storage work. People's governments at all levels, cooperatives, and in some places, Party organizations, have devoted great efforts to carrying out patriotic cotton selling and storing work. Many rural Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have played an exemplary role in the cotton selling and storing movement. Many cotton farmers have also responded to the government's call, resulting in certain achievements in cotton purchasing and storage work. A considerable amount of cotton has already been transported by train and ship to Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places to meet the needs of various factories, but this is far from meeting the needs of the factories. Therefore, cotton purchasing and storage remains a difficult and urgent task at the present stage. Now is the season for exchanging cotton for wheat, and new cotton is about to enter the market. All localities should vigorously carry out cotton purchasing and storage work. It is believed that there will be more and more vehicles and ships continuously carrying large quantities of cotton to various factories. This is cotton being transported to various places by train and ship.

Party organizations in all localities should conduct discussions on cotton selling and storing, and carry out propaganda and organization work for this task. This is a discussion among all members of the Communist Party branch of Xiguzhuang Village in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, regarding a plan to launch cotton selling and storing work.

The broad masses of farmers in cotton producing areas responded to the people's government's call to sell and store cotton. This is a group of farmers from Zhentou Town, Sixth District, Shijiazhuang City, taking cotton to the cooperative.

The broad masses of farmers in New China love their motherland. They clearly remember that it was the Communist Party and the working class who led them to turn over a new leaf. They understand that being indifferent to the difficulties of the working class and industry will inevitably make it impossible to maintain and improve the living standards of farmers; and will cause them to lose their future. This is the scene in Hebei cotton producing areas, where farmers held meetings in various villages after hearing the call for the cotton selling and storing movement, raising their hands in support and resolving to sell cotton to the state.

In the cotton selling and storing movement, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in cotton producing areas took the lead in selling and storing cotton, playing an exemplary role. These are four models who took the lead in selling and storing cotton in Nanweibo Village, Shulu County, Hebei Province. Under their influence and propaganda mobilization, the entire village sold and stored 1,900 jin of lint in six days. (Photo by Wang Chunde, News Photography Bureau)

To do a good job in cotton selling and storing, it is necessary to carry out political propaganda and mobilization work, to strengthen farmers' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance; and to raise the level of farmers' awareness through this movement. This is the scene of Communist Party members Zhang Yunxia and Zhang Yunchang from Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, going deep into each household to carry out propaganda and mobilization.

In this cotton selling and storing movement, cotton farmers in many areas have realized the importance of the worker-peasant alliance and understand that supplying raw materials to factories is a prerequisite for industrializing the country and improving farmers' living standards. This is a joint letter from the farmers of Nanweibo Village, Shulu County, Hebei Province, to the worker brothers in factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao, guaranteeing that they will continuously supply seed cotton to the factories.

In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers, the people's government signed pre-purchase contracts with cotton farmers, guaranteeing that the pre-purchase price would only increase and not decrease. This is the scene of cotton farmers in Taicang County, Southern Jiangsu, handling pre-purchase contracts at the Jiuqu Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Taicang.

The seed cotton purchased from various places is processed to squeeze out the cottonseed before being sent to the factories. This is the processing situation in the cottonseed pressing plant. (Photo by Li Shu, News Photography Bureau)

To do a good job in cotton purchasing and storage, it is necessary to correctly use the method of combining political mobilization with material exchange, and there should be sufficient supply of cloth, coal, bean cake, and other items needed by cotton farmers. This is the scene of farmers in Nanweibo Village, Shulu County, Hebei Province, exchanging coal after selling their stored cotton. (Photo by Wang Chunde, News Photography Bureau)

Doing a good job in the management of the cotton market can ensure that the listed price of cotton is not out of line with the market price, and can create favorable conditions for cotton collection work. This is the scene of farmers in Shulu County, Hebei Province, selling cotton in the lint acquisition market. (Photo by Wang Chunde, News Photography Bureau)

    为购棉储棉的更大成绩而斗争
    自六月一日中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于购棉储棉工作的指示”，中共中央发出了开展爱国售棉储棉运动的号召以后，各产棉区先后开展了购棉储棉的工作；各级人民政府、合作社和有些地方的党的组织，用了很大的力量开展爱国售棉储棉工作；许多农村的共产党员和青年团员在售棉储棉的运动中，起了模范作用；许多棉农也响应了政府的号召，使得购棉储棉工作获得了一定的成绩。现在已经有不少的棉花经火车和船只运往上海、天津、青岛等地供各工厂需要，但是这还远不能满足各工厂的需要量。因此对于购棉储棉，在目前阶段，仍然是一项艰巨紧迫的任务。现在正是棉花换麦子的季节，新棉花又即将上市，各地应该大力的开展购棉储棉的工作。相信一定会有更多的车辆和船只源源不断地载着大量的棉花运往各工厂去。这是由火车和船只运往各地的棉花。
    各地党的组织应该进行售棉储棉的讨论，并进行这项工作的宣传和组织。这是河北清苑县西顾庄村中共支部全体支部委员进行关于展开售棉储棉工作计划的讨论。　（河北日报袁浩摄）
    产棉区广大农民响应了人民政府售棉储棉的号召。这是石家庄市第六区振头镇农民成群结队地将棉花送到合作社去。
    新中国的广大农民是热爱祖国的，他们清楚地记得领导他们翻身的是共产党和工人阶级，他们了解对工人阶级和工业的困难漠不关心，将必然地不可能保持和提高农民的生活水平；并将使自己失去前途。这是河北产棉区的农民听到售棉储棉运动的号召以后，分别在各村开会，举手拥护并决心把棉花卖给国家。（河北日报袁浩摄）
    在售棉储棉的运动中，各产棉区的共产党员和青年团员纷纷带头售储棉花，起了模范作用。这是河北束鹿县南位伯村带头售储棉花的四位模范，在他们的影响和宣传动员下，全村在六天中，售储皮棉一千九百斤。　（新闻摄影局王纯德摄）
    苏南太仓县石孔乡棉农，热烈响应政府售棉储棉的号召，纷纷将存棉挑到花纱布公司收花组去。　（上海解放日报董为焜摄）
    做好售棉储棉工作，必需要进行政治宣传动员工作，要加强农民的工农联盟思想；并通过这一运动提高农民的觉悟程度。这是河北清苑县农民共产党员张云霞、张云昌深入各户进行宣传动员的情形。（河北日报袁浩摄）
    在这次售棉储棉的运动中，许多地区的棉农都体会到工农联盟的重要性，了解到供给工厂原料是使国家工业化、提高农民生活水平的先决条件。这是河北省束鹿县南位伯村的农民联名写信给上海、天津、青岛各工厂工人兄弟，保证一定将籽棉源源供应工厂。　（新闻摄影局王纯德摄）
    人民政府为了保护棉农的利益，与棉农订立预购合同，保证预购价格听涨不听落。这是苏南太仓县的棉农正在太仓九曲供销合作社办理预购合同的情形。　（上海解放日报董为焜摄）
    各地收购来的籽棉，经过加工，榨去棉籽，再送到工厂去。这是压棉籽厂加工的情形。　（新闻摄影局李曙摄）
    做好购棉储棉的工作，要正确地运用政治动员和物资交换相结合的方法，应该对棉农们需要的布疋、煤、豆饼等有足够的供应。这是河北束鹿县南位伯村农民卖掉存棉后，换取煤块的情形。　（新闻摄影局王纯德摄）
    做好棉花市场的管理，可以使得棉花的牌价与市价不致脱节，可以给收棉工作创造有利的条件。这是河北束鹿县农民在皮棉收购市场出售棉花的情形。（新闻摄影局王纯德摄）
