　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th: The British Labour government's pursuit of a war preparation policy in following the United States has encountered a serious crisis within the Labour Party. The preliminary agenda and proposals for the Labour Party Annual Conference, scheduled to be held in Scarborough in October and published on July 24th, clearly demonstrate that the Labour Party's millions of grassroots members, including trade union members and ordinary Labour Party members, oppose the Labour Party's right-wing leadership and its policies that betray the interests of the working class.

　　Among the more than 500 proposals submitted by local Labour Party organizations and trade unions, only one proposal supported the government; all other proposals criticized the government's policies, either completely or partially. The Conservative Party's *Daily Graphic* commented with great surprise that the number of "critical proposals" included in this year's Labour Party Annual Conference agenda was the most the Labour Party Executive Committee had encountered in the Labour Party's fifty-year history.

　　The continuous rise in the cost of living has aroused the greatest anger among Labour Party members and the masses. As many as 134 proposals demanded lower prices, higher wages, and restrictions on profits and dividends, breaking the record of previous annual conferences.

　　Proposals on foreign policy showed that the broad masses of Labour Party members were extremely shocked by Britain's increasing slide toward war. They demanded a change in this policy. Not one of the thirty-seven proposals supported the government's foreign policy. These proposals demanded an end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of foreign troops, recognition of the government of the People's Republic of China, acceptance of the representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, and implementation of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stipulating the return of Taiwan to China. The main point of all these proposals was to affirm the necessity of reaching a peaceful understanding between the major powers. From the most severe critics of the Labour government to the most sincere supporters of the Labour government, all put forward equally urgent demands for peace.

　　The Labour government's arms expansion plan was resolutely resisted by party members and the masses. More than thirty proposals openly denounced the British arms expansion movement, and many of them demanded large-scale arms reductions. Of all the proposals, not one supported the government's call for the working class to endure sacrifices to realize the arms expansion plan.

　　The London *Daily Worker* pointed out in an editorial: "Nothing shows more clearly the deep concern about the consequences of government policy than the proposals submitted to the Labour Party Annual Conference. All these proposals show that after nearly six years of Labour Party rule, all aspects of government policy have been widely criticized."

　　British Communist Party Vice-Chairman Dutt, in a speech delivered in Brighton on the evening of the 22nd, pointed out that the Attlee government had fallen into an extremely embarrassing situation due to the opposition of the broad masses of the Labour Party. He said: "Due to the increasing opposition of the people to the arms expansion movement, Attlee and Morrison have been forced to retreat to a defensive position." "At the upcoming Trade Union Congress and Labour Party Annual Conference, the most intense debate in the history of the British labor movement will take place."

　　英工党政府追随美国扩军备战遭到工党党员群众的坚决反击
　  工党年会中许多提案要求改变现行政策
    【新华社二十六日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党政府追随美国奉行备战政策的结果，已在工党党内遭遇到严重的危机。七月二十四日所发表的定于十月间在斯卡巴罗举行的工党年会的初步议程和提案，清楚地表明了工党的数百万基本群众，包括工会会员和工党普通党员，都反对工党右翼领导机构及其叛卖工人阶级利益的政策。
    在工党各地方组织和各工会所提出的五百多件提案中，只有一件提案支持政府，其余的一切提案都完全地或部分地批评政府的政策。保守党的《每日写真报》在评论中十分惊异地说：本届工党年会议程中所包括的“批评性的提案”之多，是工党成立以来的五十年中工党执行委员会从来没有遇到过的。
    生活费用的不断上涨引起了工党党员群众最大的愤怒。要求降低物价、提高工资、限制利润和红利的议案，竟有一百三十四件之多，打破了已往历届年会的纪录。
    关于外交政策的提案，显示了广大的工党党员群众对于英国日益走向战争一事极感震惊。他们要求改变这种政策。三十七件提案中没有一件支持政府的外交政策。这些提案要求结束朝鲜战争、撤退外国军队、承认中华人民共和国政府、接纳中华人民共和国代表出席联合国、实行规定台湾归还中国的开罗宣言与波茨坦公告。所有这些提案的主旨都是在申明各大国之间取得和平谅解的必要。从最严厉的工党政府的批评者到工党政府的最真心的拥护者，都提出了同等迫切的和平要求。
    工党政府的扩充军备计划遭到党员群众的坚决还击。有三十多件提案对于英国扩军运动表示公开的斥责，其中许多提案要求大量裁减军备。在全部提案中，没有一件提案支持政府所发出的要求工人阶级为实现扩军计划而忍受牺牲的号召。
    伦敦《工人日报》在社论中指出：“再没有什么东西比向工党年会提出的提案更明白地表明对政府政策之后果的深切关怀了。所有这些提案表明在工党当权将近六年之后，政府政策的各个方面都受到了广泛的批评。”
    英国共产党副主席杜德于二十二日晚在布来屯发表的演说中，指出由于工党广大群众的反对，艾德礼政府已陷于窘迫不堪的境地，他说：“由于人民对扩张军备运动的反对日益增加，艾德礼和莫里逊已被迫退居守势”，“在不久以后举行的职工大会和工党年会上，将要发生英国劳工运动有史以来最激烈的争论。”
