  Using "Upgrading" as a Means to Compete for Cotton Purchases is Wrong!
　　In the cotton purchasing and storage work in Hebei Province, cooperative societies played a significant role; however, in some places, the work of cooperative societies and the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company not only failed to coordinate but even led to serious disputes. For example, in Handan Prefecture, especially in Wu'an County, such serious phenomena occurred between several cooperative societies and the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. In mid-to-late June, both sides used the method of upgrading cotton in the market (purchasing inferior cotton at the price of good cotton) to compete for cotton. In this way, the grading lost its accurate standard, and cotton farmers probed both sides when selling cotton, choosing to sell to the higher bidder. This not only wasted manpower and affected purchases but also caused losses to both the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company and the cooperative societies. This problem has not been fundamentally resolved to this day. This is an extremely egregious form of capitalist commercial competition; it is absolutely impermissible for it to occur between state-owned commerce of a socialist nature and cooperative societies of a semi-socialist nature, and it is extremely harmful to the country and the people. The relevant authorities should severely punish the units and cadres who do so!
  Southwest China's Peasants Demonstrated a High Degree of Patriotism in the Summer Grain Collection
　　Over 80 percent of the summer public grain in the entire Southwest region has been collected and all of it has been put into storage.

　　During the summer grain collection, peasants in various places launched a wave of enthusiasm for sending grain to the warehouses. In Xiaogan Township, Deyang County, Western Sichuan District, four grain delivery brigades (more than one hundred groups) were organized before the collection began. On the day the collection began, the four brigades systematically delivered all the public grain to the warehouse. In many places in the Southern Sichuan District, peasants also initiated grain delivery competitions. The conditions were to deliver well and deliver quickly. Now, most of the public grain in various parts of Southwest China has been collected, and people in various places are actively establishing mass organizations to protect the warehouses, assisting the government in protecting the warehouses.

　　The smooth progress of the summer grain collection in Southwest China demonstrates the increased political awareness of the peasants after the anti-American, aid-Korea patriotic education and the rent reduction movement.

  用“升级”的办法争购棉花是错误的！
    河北省购棉储棉工作中，合作社起了相当大的作用；但有些地方合作社和花纱布公司工作不但配合不起来，反而大闹纠纷。如邯郸专区，特别是武安县，若干合作社与花纱布公司之间就曾发生这种严重的现象。六月中、下旬，双方曾在市场上用把棉花升级（次等棉按好棉价收购）的办法互相争购棉花。这样，评级失去了准确的标准，棉农就在售棉时两边探测，择高价出售。这样不仅浪费人力，影响收购，而且花纱布公司和合作社双方均有损失。这一问题至今还未根本解决。这是极为恶劣的资本主义的商业竞争方式；发生在社会主义性质的国营商业和半社会主义性质的合作社中间，是绝对不能容许的，是对国家和人民极为有害的。有关机关对于这样做的单位和干部，应予以严厉制裁！
  西南农民在夏征中表现了高度的爱国热情
    西南全区夏季公粮，已征起百分之八十以上，并已全部入仓。
    在夏征中，各地农民掀起了送粮入仓的热潮。川西区德阳县孝感乡，在开征前就组织了四个送粮大队（一百多个小组）。开征的当天，四个大队就有组织地把全部公粮送入了仓库。川南区许多地方的农民还发起缴粮竞赛。条件是缴的好，缴的快。现在，西南各地大部公粮都已征起，各地人民正纷纷建立护仓的群众组织，协助政府护仓。
    西南夏征工作的顺利，表现了农民经过抗美援朝爱国主义教育和减租运动后政治觉悟的提高。
