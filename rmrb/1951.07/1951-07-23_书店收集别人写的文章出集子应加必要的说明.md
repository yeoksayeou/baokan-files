To the Editor:

　　Recently, we read the book "On Loyalty and Honesty" (published by Dazhong Bookstore in April 1951). In the article "A Few Words on Honesty" written by Yuan Bing, there is a passage that reads: "In short, the reason why the word 'honesty' is misunderstood, and honest people are despised, is due to the sins of the old society where people oppress and exploit each other. Today, taking China as an example, apart from the vast liberated areas and democratic Guandong, there is still half of China where this situation is continuing with increasing severity."

　　Obviously, this article was written a long time ago, when many places in Guannei had not yet been liberated. However, the end of the article only states "('Learning Life, Volume 2, Issue 3')" without mentioning the year and month the article was written. The front of the book only has a table of contents and a few introductory remarks. Therefore, I believe that when publishing a book, it is necessary to write a preface to clearly explain the significance of publishing the book. If some articles written in the past are selected, and some situations are not suitable for the present, it is necessary to add explanations.

　　Now we often find books in bookstores that are casually collected and published from other people's articles, with no preface in the front and no indication of the year and month the articles were written at the end. This careless style should be corrected.

### 书店收集别人写的文章出集子应加必要的说明

　　书店收集别人写的文章出集子应加必要的说明编辑同志：
    近来我们读了《论忠诚与老实》这本书（该书是一九五一年四月大众书店印行的）。其中原冰写的《漫谈老实》一篇文章中有这样一段话：“总而言之‘老实’二字之所以被误解，老实人之所以被轻视，是那种人压迫人、人剥削人的旧社会的罪恶所造成。在今天来讲，就拿我们中国，除了广大的解放区和民主的关东以外，还有半个中国，正变本加厉的继续着这种情形。”
    很显然，这篇文章是在很早以前，关内还有许多地方没有解放的时候写的。但该文末只注明“（‘学习生活第二卷第三期’）”而没有注明写文章的年月。书的前面，只有目录，也没有几句交代的话。所以我认为出版一本书，必须要在前面写几句序言，把出版该书的意义交代清楚。如选辑过去写的一些文章，有些情况与目前不适合时，就必须加以说明。
    现在我们在书店中时常发现随便收集别人的文章出版的书，前面没有序言，文末也没有注明写文章的年月。这种粗枝大叶的作风是应当纠正的。
