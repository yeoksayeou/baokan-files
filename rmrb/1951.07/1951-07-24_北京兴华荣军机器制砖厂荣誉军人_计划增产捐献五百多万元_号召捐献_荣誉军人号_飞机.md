　　Beijing Xinghua Rongjun Machine Brick Factory's Veterans
　　Plan to Increase Production and Donate Over 5 Million Yuan
　　Calling for Donations for a "Veterans' Airplane"

Editor:
　　We are forty-five disabled veterans from the Xinghua Rongjun Machine Brick Factory in the capital, Beijing. After our demobilization, the government showed great concern and care for us by creating this factory, allowing us to continue working on the production front. We live in a revolutionary family and feel incredibly warm and happy.
　　After listening to the report from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, we know that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army needs more airplanes and cannons to eliminate the American invading forces in Korea as soon as possible. The Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression and Aiding Korea has issued a call for donations of airplanes and cannons. We resolutely respond to this call and have motivated more than two hundred workers throughout the factory to formulate a production increase plan, cooperating with the factory to establish a bonus method for exceeding quotas to participate in the donation campaign. All of us disabled revolutionary veterans will take the lead in actively producing, studying technology, saving raw materials, and increasing production efficiency. We plan that by the end of the year, the forty-five of us can increase production and donate a total of 5.74 million yuan.
　　We disabled revolutionary veterans were injured in the revolutionary war and became disabled; therefore, we love our motherland even more and hate the enemy. We suggest that disabled revolutionary veterans across the country enthusiastically participate in the donation campaign and jointly donate a "Veterans' Airplane" to support our dearest brothers – the People's Volunteer Army.

　　北京兴华荣军机器制砖厂荣誉军人
　  计划增产捐献五百多万元
　  号召捐献“荣誉军人号”飞机编辑同志：
    我们是首都兴华荣军机器制砖厂四十五个革命残废军人。我们复员后，政府对我们关心照顾，为我们创建了这个工厂，让我们转到生产战线上继续工作。我们生活在革命大家庭里，感到无比的温暖和愉快。
    听了中国人民赴朝慰问团的报告，我们知道：中国人民志愿军需要更多的飞机大炮，以便提早把美国侵略军队消灭在朝鲜。中国人民抗美援朝总会发出了捐献飞机大炮的号召。我们坚决响应这个号召，并带动全厂二百多个工人拟订了增产计划，配合厂方订出了超额奖金办法来参加捐献运动。我们全体革命残废军人更要带头积极生产，研究技术，节省原料，提高生产效率。我们计划：到年底，我们四十五个人共可增产捐献五百七十四万元。
    我们革命残废军人在革命战争中负了伤，成了残废；因此，我们更热爱我们的祖国和憎恨敌人。我们建议全国革命残废军人热烈参加捐献运动，合力捐献一架“荣誉军人号”飞机，来支援我们最亲爱的兄弟——人民志愿军。
      北京市兴华荣军机器制砖厂全体革命残废军人
        任德胜等四十五人
