Shanghai People from All Walks of Life Launch Work to Support the Military and Give Preferential Treatment to Families

People from all walks of life in Shanghai are enthusiastically responding to the call of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to further develop the work of providing preferential treatment. Relevant government agencies and people's organizations have held several meetings to arrange this work. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in May, there are more than 17,000 households of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers' families, with a population of over 60,000 in the city and its 30 suburban districts. Since liberation, the municipal and district people's governments have established a number of production institutions to solve the livelihood problems of some revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers' families, and veterans, and more than 3,600 people have obtained jobs through government introductions. Regular living subsidies or temporary relief have also been provided to impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers. During the Spring Festival this year, permanent committees for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families were established in various districts, and widespread comfort meetings were held. People from all walks of life also donated 2.5 billion yuan in cash (of which 1.9 billion yuan was used as a production fund) to help families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers solve their livelihood problems. However, after the Spring Festival, the leading organs in the city relaxed their leadership, and the work of giving preferential treatment in the city became somewhat slack. In order to correct this shortcoming, many factories, schools, government organizations, and street neighborhoods have launched publicity and education and practical work in this area, and have incorporated plans and methods for preferential treatment of families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers into their patriotic covenants for earnest implementation.

Patriotic Education in Chongqing Achieves Great Success

The anti-American aggression and aid Korea propaganda and education work in Chongqing has been basically popularized after the "May 1st" mass demonstration, and more than 85% of the city's population has received patriotic education. According to statistics, on May 1st, a total of more than 1,040,000 people in the city participated in rallies and parades, accounting for more than 55% of the city's total population (including Ba County, the same below). The number of people who signed in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty reached more than 1,349,000, accounting for 71% of the city's total population. The number of people who voted against the United States arming Japan reached more than 1,283,000, accounting for 67.5% of the city's total population. Chongqing mobilized a large-scale propaganda force in carrying out the patriotic movement. In the first, second, third, fifth, and seventh districts alone, the number of mobilized propagandists, government cadres, teachers, students, and resident activists reached more than 26,000; and more than 775,000 people received propaganda. More than 11,000 large and small forums and mass meetings were held in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts, with more than 539,000 people participating. The tests conducted by various districts before and after "May 1st" proved that this movement in Chongqing has achieved great success in popularization. For example, a test conducted among the family members of workers in the 1102 factory showed that 100% of them knew that the Soviet Union is our friend and American imperialism is our enemy, and more than 95% of them understood the political significance of signing and voting. More than 95% of the masses in Jiguan and Shiqiao townships in the sixth district understood the reasons for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and opposing the U.S. arming of Japan.

  上海市各界人民开展优抚工作
    上海市各界人民群众热烈响应抗美援朝总会的号召，进一步开展优抚工作。政府有关机关和人民团体已召开了几次会议，布置这个工作。据上海市政府民政局五月份统计，该市市、郊三十个区，共有烈、军、工属一万七千多户，人口在六万以上。解放后，市、区人民政府筹办了若干生产机构，解决了一部分烈、军、工属和荣誉军人的生活问题，经政府介绍而获得职业的有三千六百多人。对贫苦烈、军、工属，还作了经常的生活补助或临时救济。今年春节，各区建立了经常性的拥军优属运动委员会，普遍召开了慰问大会，各界人民并捐献了二十五亿现款（其中十九亿作为生产基金），帮助烈、军、工属解决生活问题。但春节后，由于该市领导机关放松了领导，该市的优抚工作有些松懈。为纠正此一缺点，目前不少工厂、学校、机关团体、街道里弄已经开展这方面的宣传教育和实际工作，并将优待烈属、军属、工属的计划和办法订入自己的爱国公约中，加以切实执行。
  重庆市的爱国教育获得很大成绩
    重庆市抗美援朝宣传教育工作，经过“五一”大示威已基本上做到普及，全市已有百分之八十五以上的人口受到了爱国教育。据统计，五月一日，全市参加集会游行的群众共一百零四万余人，占全市（包括巴县，下同）总人口百分之五十五强。拥护缔结和平公约签名的人数达一百三十四万九千余人，占全市总人口百分之七十一。投票反对美国武装日本的人数达一百二十八万三千余人，占全市总人口百分之六十七点五。重庆市在开展爱国运动中，动员了大规模的宣传力量。仅一、二、三、五、七五个区所动员的宣传员、机关干部，教师、学生、居民积极分子，即达二万六千余人；受到宣传的群众达七十七万五千余人。一、二、三、四、五等区开了大小座谈会及群众大会一万一千余次，有五十三万九千余人参加。各区在“五一”前后举行的测验中证明，重庆市这次运动在普及方面有很大成绩。如一一○二厂在工人家属中进行测验，百分之百都知道苏联是我们的朋友，美帝国主义是我们的敌人，百分之九十五以上的人都懂得签名和投票的政治意义。六区鸡冠、石桥两乡群众百分之九十五以上懂得为什么要抗美援朝和反对美国武装日本的道理。
