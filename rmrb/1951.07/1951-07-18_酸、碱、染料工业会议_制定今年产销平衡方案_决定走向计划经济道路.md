　　Acid, Alkali, and Dyestuff Industry Conference
　　Formulating this Year's Production and Sales Balance Plan
　　Deciding to Take the Road of Planned Economy
　　In order to strengthen the leadership over the acid, alkali, and dyestuff industry, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government convened an acid, alkali, and dyestuff industry conference. This conference gained a comprehensive understanding of the production and sales situation of acids, alkalis, and dyestuffs, and decided that, in order to cooperate with the state's overall construction policy, meet the needs of national defense construction, and take care of civilian use, the acid, alkali, and dyestuff industry should move towards the road of planned economy in the future. The conference believes that the phenomenon of scattered, blind, and unplanned production should be eliminated, and the shortcomings of some regions having surplus production while others lack products, and some finished products being purchased from abroad when they can be produced domestically, should be corrected. The conference believes that the acids, alkalis, and dyestuffs needed by general industry at present can be fully supplied as long as organization and coordination are well done. To this end, the conference formulated a production and sales balance plan for various products in 1951 based on the output of various products and the needs of various regions, and suggested that the trade departments control the price differences between regions and organize exchange work to regulate the supply and demand between regions.
　　In order to eliminate the waste caused by decentralized management and facilitate the government's unified planning and ordering, the conference called on small acid, alkali, and dyestuff factories to organize themselves and implement joint or cooperative management. The conference also put forward preliminary opinions on the organizational structure, responsibilities, and tasks of joint operations for the reference of the attending representatives.
　　This conference was held in Beijing from June 5th to 15th. Ninety-eight people attended the conference, including representatives from industrial authorities of major administrative regions, representatives from public and private acid, alkali, and dyestuff factories, representatives from relevant units, and experts.

　　酸、碱、染料工业会议
    制定今年产销平衡方案
    决定走向计划经济道路
    为了加强对于酸、碱、染料工业的领导，中央人民政府重工业部召开了酸碱染料工业会议。这次会议了解了酸、碱、染料产销的全面情况，并决定，为了配合国家总的建设方针，配合国防建设的需要并照顾民用，今后酸、碱、染料工业应走向计划经济的道路。会议认为应该消除分散的、盲目的、无计划生产的现象，纠正有的地区生产过剩而有的地区产品不够以及有些成品国内能够生产却向国外购买等缺点。会议认为目前一般工业需要的酸、碱、染料，只要组织调剂得好，是可以得到充分供应的。为此，会议根据各项产品的产量及各地的需要量，制订了一九五一年各种产品的产销平衡方案，并建议由贸易部门掌握地区间的差价，组织交流工作，以调节各区间的供求。
    为了消除分散经营造成的浪费现象，便于政府统一计划和订货，会议号召小型酸、碱、染料工厂组织起来，实行联合经营或合营。会议并提出了关于联营的组织机构、职责任务等的初步意见，供与会代表参考。
    这次会议是在六月五日到十五日在北京举行的。出席会议的有各大行政区工业主管部门代表，公、私营酸、碱、染料工厂代表，各有关单位代表和专家等九十八人。
