Introducing "Liberation Army Literature"
    Hou Jinjing

    The publication of "Liberation Army Literature" is a major event in the literary work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The literary work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has formed its own tradition and characteristics through more than 20 years of war. It has a strong combativeness and is closely linked to the commanders and fighters of the troops. It quickly reflects the battles and life, progress and development of the troops, the patriotic spirit, high class consciousness, glorious achievements, and heroic spirit of the commanders and fighters. The literary workers of the troops breathe the same air as the soldiers and beat with the same pulse. Literary life has become a part of the combat life of the troops. Precisely because of this, this literary arm has a vigorous creativity and a brave and bold spirit of creation. On the entire literary front, new and promising literary workers of the troops are constantly emerging, producing works that reflect the People's Liberation Army with a relatively high degree of ideological content and a considerable influence among the troops and the people.

    The contents of the inaugural issue of "Liberation Army Literature" include six essays, seven poems, six essays and sketches (including four sketches from the Korean battlefield), four novels, and three introductions of works. It totals about 200,000 words.

    Reportage, essays, and sketches, like short, swift attacks in battle, are the sharpest and most combative forms. This issue includes six of them, which is a feature of this publication.

    Song Zhidi's "Belief" (essay) uses concise and clear language to describe the new heroes on the Korean battlefield. How their character and emotions grow in battle: A fourteen-year-old Korean girl develops a strong belief and an invincible force in the war. A volunteer army nurse, an ordinary female student, understands what to love and how to love in the war, and how a fearless heroic force is born in her. The volunteer soldiers are filled with a great spirit of internationalism. Seeing the atrocities of the American invading army with their own eyes arouses incomparable anger. Finally, they annihilate the enemy and make meritorious contributions. These true heroes also understand true honor and happiness.

    Ji Xichen and Wei Feng's "Planting the Red Flag on the Himalayas" reports on how the People's Liberation Army, on the plateau of 5,000 meters above sea level, crossed rapids, climbed perpetually frozen icebergs, and passed through impenetrable ancient forests, conquering the climate of "rain in eastern Shandong and cold in western Shanxi." The soldiers said, "The mountain is a white mattress, and the sky is a blue quilt." Their magnificent spirit is fully expressed in the report.

    Wei Wei's "Spring Festival Night on the Front Line" describes the soldiers fighting on New Year's Eve while thinking of their motherland, eating the comfort items from their motherland, and experiencing the warm feelings that the great motherland brings to the soldiers. Anyone who reads it will be infected by their brave and optimistic spirit.

    Lu Zhuguo's "Wind and Snow on the Eastern Front" is the first relatively successful novella with the combat of the Volunteer Army as its theme since the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. This is a creation with straightforward writing and strong emotional appeal. The author uses strong strokes to describe the Volunteer Army overcoming the severe cold of minus 20 degrees, marching in the ice and snow, and fiercely attacking the American invading army on the most difficult eastern front. Although the images of instructor Yu Lin, company commander, and other soldiers only outline a silhouette, they are vivid and moving. It would be impossible to create such a work without the author's personal experience and experience of the war life on the eastern front. The whole article is filled with the author's sincere love for the soldiers. The author reflects the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is rapidly growing in the soldiers and in the author himself.

    Another novel, "Little Devil and the Regiment Commander" (by Su Ce), has common characteristics with "Wind and Snow on the Eastern Front." It expresses the distinctive and energetic heroic characters in the troops. The author strives to explore and express the ideological foundation of the characters.

    The poems in this issue have outstanding achievements. "The Ten Fears of the US Army" is a fast-paced ballad collectively created by the Volunteer Army soldiers, which describes the tactical characteristics of the Volunteer Army, the soldiers' bright and cheerful character, and the spirit of despising the enemy. The poem has a simple and powerful style. Another poem, "Target Practice" (by Lv Song), also has the same characteristics.

    Another poem is the posthumous work of martyr Zhang Jianhua. The author was a cultural teacher in the Volunteer Army company and was only eighteen years old when he sacrificed. He left two volumes of poetry. The one published in this issue is "Marching Horn," which has a strong rhythm and jumps with fire-like enthusiasm. We can see that it was created to be recited to the soldiers, conveying the fighting mood of the soldiers and himself, and the will and belief to dedicate themselves to human peace and happiness. He wrote:
        The marching horn calls out loudly
        It is glorious to fight in Korea!
        Even if we shed some blood –
        It will make the ruined Korea
        Factories smoke and crops grow well,
        Flowers bloom all over the road.

    These poems will inject new blood into our poetry front, bring in healthy and vibrant elements, and a fighting collectivist spirit.

    The essays by Liu Baiyu and Huang Mei, and the creative summaries by Wu Qiang and Hu Ke, are all focused on how to create the image of heroic characters, which is not accidental. Especially the essays by Liu Baiyu and Huang Mei, not only make us understand why there are many moving works in this issue of "Liberation Army Literature," but also allow us to understand that the creative thinking of the troops is beginning a major change, a qualitative leap. With the increasing regularization and modernization of the troops, and the rapid improvement of class consciousness, every soldier has a clearer understanding of the important task of the Chinese people to consolidate Eastern peace and world peace. The literary work of the troops has also made greater progress. This is the issue raised by Liu Baiyu, creating the great and advanced heroic image of the People's Liberation Army as a creative guideline.

    This publication also has its own characteristics in form. Short poems, sketches, and longer novels are all accompanied by illustrations, and the layout appears more lively. Undoubtedly, this will be more welcomed by the vast number of military readers and general readers.

　　介绍《解放军文艺》
    侯金镜
    《解放军文艺》的创刊，是中国人民解放军文艺工作的一件大事情。
    中国人民解放军的文艺工作，在二十多年战争的锻炼中，形成了自己的传统和特点。它有着强烈的战斗性，与部队的指战员有着密切的联系。它迅速地反映了部队的战斗和生活、进步和发展、指战员的爱国主义精神、高度的阶级觉悟、光荣的战绩和英雄气概。部队文艺工作者与战士同一呼吸，跳动着同一的脉搏。文艺生活，已经成为部队战斗生活的一部分。也正因为这样，这支文艺兵种就具有着旺盛的创造力和勇敢大胆的创作精神。在整个文艺战线上，不断涌现出新的有远大前途的部队文艺工作者，产生着有比较高度思想性的、在部队和人民中间有相当影响的反映人民解放军的作品。
    《解放军文艺》创刊号的内容包括论文六篇、诗歌七首、散文和速写六篇（其中朝鲜战地速写四篇），小说四篇和作品介绍三篇。共约二十万字。
    报告文学、散文和速写，像战斗中的短促出击一样，是最尖锐最富有战斗性的形式，这一期就包括了六篇，是这刊物的一个特点。
    宋之的的“信念”（散文），以简练明快的语言，描写了朝鲜战场上的新的英雄。他们的性格和感情怎样在战斗中成长着：一个十四岁的朝鲜姑娘在战争中产生了坚强的信念，不可征服的力量。志愿军的护士，一个平常的女学生，在战争中懂得了爱什么，怎样去爱，在她的身上怎样产生了无所畏惧的英雄力量。志愿军战士充溢着伟大的国际主义精神，亲眼看到美国侵略军的暴行，更引起无比的愤怒，最后他们歼灭了敌人，立了功，这些真正的英雄们，也最懂得真正的荣誉和幸福。
    纪希晨、魏风的“把红旗插上喜马拉雅山”，报导了人民解放军在拔海五千公尺的高原上，渡过急流，爬过终年冻结的冰山，穿过密不透风的古森林，征服了“山东边阴雨山西边寒”的气候。战士们说：“山是白褥，天是蓝被”。他们的雄伟的气魄在报道中获得了充分表现。
    魏巍的《火线春节夜》，描写战士们在大年夜一面战斗，一面想念着祖国，吃着祖国的慰劳品，体味着伟大祖国的给战士们带来温厚的感情。任何人读了它，也会为他们勇敢乐观的情绪所感染。
    陆柱国的“风雪东线”，是抗美援朝以来，以志愿军的战斗为题材的第一个写得比较成功的中篇小说。这是一篇文字朴直而情绪强烈感人的创作。作者用壮健的笔触描写志愿军克服了零下二十度的严寒，在冰天雪地中行进，并且在最艰苦的东线狠狠地打击了美国侵略军。指导员于林、连长和其他战士的形象虽只勾出了一个轮廓，但是生动感人。不是作者亲身经历和体验了东线的战争生活，是不可能创作这样的作品的。全篇洋溢着作者对战士的真挚的热爱。作者反映了伟大的中国人民志愿军的国际主义精神，这是在战士们身上，也在作者自己的身上迅速成长着的。
    另一篇小说《小鬼与团长》（苏策作）和《风雪东线》有共同的特点。它表现了部队中色彩鲜明、精力充沛的英雄人物。作者努力发掘和表现人物的思想基础。
    诗在这一期有着突出的成绩。“美军十大怕”是志愿军战士们集体创作的快板，写出了志愿军的战术特点，战士们明快、爽朗的性格，蔑视敌人的气概。诗篇具有朴素而有力的风格。另一首诗“打靶”（吕松作）也具有同样的特色。
    又一篇诗是烈士张建华的遗作，作者是志愿军连队文化教员，牺牲时只有十八岁。他留下了两册诗稿。这期发表的是“进军号”，节奏强烈，跳荡着火一样的热情。我们看得出来是为朗诵给战士们听而创作的，传达了战士也传达了他自己前进的战斗的情绪、献身给人类和平幸福的意志和信念。他这样写着：
        进军号洪亮的叫
        战斗在朝鲜多荣耀！
        就是我们流点血——
        会使废墟的朝鲜
        工厂冒烟庄稼好，
        鲜花开满道。
    这些诗会给我们的诗歌战线注入新的血液，带进健康的充满生命力的因素，和战斗的集体主义的情绪。
    刘白羽和荒煤的论文、吴强和胡可的创作总结，内容都集中在如何创造英雄人物的形象上，这不是偶然的。尤其是刘白羽和荒煤的论文，不仅使我们了解了为什么这一期《解放军文艺》上有不少动人的作品，而且也能了解到部队的创作思想在开始一个很大的变化，一个质的飞跃。由于部队日益正规化、近代化、阶级觉悟飞速的提高，每一个战士在思想中更加明确了中国人民所担负的巩固东方和平、世界和平的重大任务。部队的文艺工作也有了更大的进步。这就是刘白羽所提出的，创造人民解放军伟大先进的英雄形象，作为创作方针的一个问题。
    这个刊物在形式上，也有着自己的特点。短诗、速写、较长的小说，都配合了插画，编排显得比较活泼，无疑的，这样会更受到广大部队读者和一般读者的欢迎。
