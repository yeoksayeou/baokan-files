(II) Mass Propaganda Work Should Not Be Extravagant and Wasteful or Hinder Production
	The universality and depth of mass propaganda work have reached an unprecedented level in the movements to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, land reform, and suppress counter-revolutionaries. The development of mass propaganda work has greatly enhanced the political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, thus not only promoting the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and counter-revolutionary elements, but also promoting the development of national economic construction and cultural construction. Therefore, it is undoubtedly necessary to continue to deepen mass propaganda work.
	However, mass propaganda work must be developed on the right track, and this work must not hinder production or cause extravagance and waste. Recently, some places have seen undesirable tendencies of hindering production and extravagance and waste in carrying out mass propaganda work, which deserves serious attention. According to a report in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on the 9th of this month: In June, the Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to carry out a traffic safety campaign, without the approval of the Chongqing Municipal leadership, arbitrarily mobilized more than 200 propaganda teams composed of more than 7,400 people in the city center, and mobilized nearly 100 Yangko teams, waist drum teams, and lotus teams in the first and second districts, and mobilized teachers and students of primary and secondary schools to participate in publicity and sentry duty; at the same time, hundreds of mass rallies were held, and mass parades and demonstrations were launched for days, resulting in an astonishing waste of manpower and materials, hindering production, business operations, and traffic order, and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. In addition, the Yangko teams and waist drum teams led by various public security police stations and trade unions in Chongqing often practiced during production time, beating gongs and drums everywhere; some waist drum teams paid too much attention to beautiful forms, and it cost four to five million yuan or even fourteen to five million yuan to remake new clothes for a waist drum team, and they often demanded that the public "treat" them. Some workers', shop assistants' and citizens' spare-time schools in Chongqing require the masses to persist in studying for four hours every day from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m., and some shop assistants and handicraftsmen close their shops and go to study at 7:00 p.m. every evening. All these hinder production, or even cause waste of manpower and materials. In addition to Chongqing, similar undesirable phenomena have also been found in Shanghai and other places. These undesirable phenomena must be resolutely corrected.
	In order to correct the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena, the Chongqing Municipal and Southwest Administrative Region leading organs have once again put forward the instruction that no organs or groups can arbitrarily mobilize the masses to parade, publicize, and hold meetings in the future, and require that in the future, the masses must be mobilized according to their own systems (according to the organizational system of the masses themselves), and no organs or groups can exceed their scope of responsibilities in the matter of mobilizing the masses. At the same time, it is pointed out that the leading organs at all levels should persuade the people's organizations not to mobilize the masses to parade at will; the practice of cultural propaganda organizations such as Yangko teams and waist drum teams must be strictly limited to rest time, and must not affect production, business, urban order, and the life of residents; the study time of the masses must be immediately adjusted on the principle of the masses' voluntariness and without hindering production and business. The measures taken by the Chongqing Municipal leadership are completely correct and worthy of reference by all parts of the country.

  （二）开展群众宣传工作不要铺张浪费和妨碍生产
    群众宣传工作的普遍与深入，在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的运动中，已经达到空前的水平。群众宣传工作的开展，大大提高了人民群众的政治觉悟和革命积极性，从而它不但推动了中国人民的反对帝国主义、反对封建主义和反对反革命分子的斗争，而且推动了国家经济建设及文化建设事业的发展。因此必须继续深入开展群众宣传工作，这是毫无疑问的。
    但是必须使群众宣传工作在正确的轨道上发展，不要使这一工作妨碍生产和造成铺张浪费。最近有些地方在开展群众宣传工作中已经发生妨碍生产和铺张浪费的不良倾向，这是值得严重注意的。据重庆新华日报本月九日载：重庆市人民政府公安局在六月间为了开展交通安全运动，未经重庆市领导机关批准，即在市中心区擅自动员由七千四百余人组成的宣传队二百余队，另在第一、二区动员近百个秧歌队、腰鼓队、莲莦队，并动员中小学师生参加宣传及站岗；同时召开各种群众集会数百次，并连日发动群众游行示威，因而造成了人力物力的惊人浪费，妨碍生产、经营及交通秩序，引起群众不满。此外，重庆市各公安派出所及各行业工会所领导的秧歌队、腰鼓队，常常在生产的时间内进行练习，到处敲锣打鼓；有些腰鼓队过分讲求形式漂亮，一个腰鼓队改做新服装，动辄花上四五百万元甚至一千四五百万元，并动辄要求公家“请客”。重庆市工人、店员及市民的业余学校，有些要求群众每日从晚上八时到十二时坚持学习四小时，有些商店店员和手工业者每到晚上七时即关门学习去了。这些都使生产受到妨碍，或者还造成了人力物力的浪费。除重庆以外，在上海以及其他地方，也发现了类似的不良现象。这种不良现象都是必须加以坚决纠正的。
    为着纠正上述不良现象，重庆市和西南大行政区领导机关已经再一次提出：任何机关团体今后都不能随便动员群众游行、宣传和开会的指示，并要求今后动员群众必须各按系统（按照群众自己的组织系统），任何机关团体在动员群众的问题上，不能超过自己的职责范围。同时指出，各级领导机关要说服各人民团体，不要随便动员群众游行；秧歌队、腰鼓队等文化宣传组织进行练习，必须严格限制在休息时间之内，不能影响生产、营业、城市秩序及居民的生活；群众的学习时间，必须在群众自愿和不妨碍生产及营业的原则下，立刻加以调整。重庆市领导机关所采取的这些措施，是完全正确的，值得全国各地参考。
