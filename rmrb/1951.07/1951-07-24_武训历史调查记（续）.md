　　A Continued Record of the Historical Investigation of Wu Xun
    Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team
  (1) Song Jing-shi, Local Peasant Revolutionary Leader Contemporary with Wu Xun
    Wu Xun's eulogists once criticized people for "lacking a historical materialist viewpoint," "incorrectly" using "today's standards" to measure "historical figures"; and said that Wu Xun was subject to "specific historical conditions" and could not have revolutionary thoughts and actions. After people pointed out the specific historical environment Wu Xun was in, which was the era of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Northern Nian Army's peasant revolution, some of those who praised Wu Xun were still not entirely convinced, arguing that those revolutionary armies did not originate in Wu Xun's hometown. Although they fought in Wu Xun's hometown, they were always outsiders, and it was forgivable that they did not attract Wu Xun's attention.
    Our investigation has uncovered revolutionary armies from Wu Xun's hometown. They were neither the Taiping Army nor the Nian Army, but local peasant revolutionary armies in Wu Xun's hometown that were connected to the Nian Army. This fact allows us to provide a "specific historical condition" and some "historical figures" as a basis for everyone's judgment. With these facts, it is not difficult for us to answer: Who is "lacking a historical materialist viewpoint"? Is it the people who criticize and despise Wu Xun, or the people who promote and praise Wu Xun?
    The "specific historical conditions" and "historical figures" we have obtained are as follows:
    In 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng), just one year after Wu Xun put up the sign of "begging for education" (according to previous records, Wu Xun was born in 1838, the eighteenth year of Daoguang, and Wu Xun began to put up this sign in 1859, the ninth year of Xianfeng, when Wu Xun was 21 years old), that is, when Wu Xun was 22 years old, a peasant uprising connected to the Nian Army broke out in the vast area of ​​Tangyi, Guantao, Linqing, and Guanxian counties. In Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, seven miles southwest of Wu Zhuang, Liulin Town, Tangyi County, where Wu Xun was born, a peasant revolutionary leader, Song Jing-shi, emerged. The peasant armed force he led was called the Black Flag Army. And in the Wu Zhuang area, the Black Flag Army had a "major battle" with the army of Senggelinqin, the Prince of Korchin, a general of the Manchu Qing government. ("Linqing County Chronicle" Volume 1, Page 16)
    At the same time and in the same place, there existed two completely different figures: one surrendered to the landlord class and the feudal rulers, and the other carried out a revolution against the landlord class and the feudal rulers; one was consistently cultivated, embellished, and praised by the reactionary ruling class of the time and thereafter, and the other was slandered, suppressed, and exterminated by the reactionary ruling class of the time; one was despised and scorned by the working people of the time and even now, and the other was supported and loved by the working people of the time and even now. The former is Wu Xun, and the latter is Song Jing-shi.
    At that time, tens of thousands of peasants in Tangyi, Guantao, Linqing, and Guanxian counties in Shandong were involved in the vigorous revolutionary tide. But Wu Xun was not only separated from this tide, but also ran to attach himself to the dying oppressive class that suppressed the peasants. Song Jing-shi threw himself into this huge tide and became the most famous leader of the local peasant masses, standing at the forefront of the historical era.
    Although these uprisings appeared in the name of various religions, such as the White Lotus Sect, the Eight Trigrams Sect, and the Fu Sect, their essence was all peasant revolutions that erupted due to the increasingly deepening social class contradictions. The concentration of land, the increase in exploitation, coupled with famines mainly caused by man-made factors, made the peasants who were trapped in the abyss of suffering bravely organize and declare war on the reactionary ruling class. In the "Linqing County Chronicle" (Volume 1, Pages 14 and 15), we can see that in the era in which Wu Xun lived, famines occurred continuously in that area. In the year Wu Xun was born, the eighteenth year of Daoguang (1838), "rice crops were damaged by locusts," the twenty-second year was hail, the twenty-fourth year was flood, the twenty-sixth year was drought and wind, and the twenty-eighth year was a major flood; the seventh year of Xianfeng was "flying locusts covered the sky, and all the crops were exhausted, a great famine," and the eighth year was again "a great famine, people ate wheat seedlings, a great epidemic"; the first year of Guangxu was again "a great famine," the second year "a great drought," the third year "a great famine," and the fourth year "a great famine." Alongside these were records of "Yue bandits," "religious bandits," "Nian bandits," and "thieves" ... "spreading," "roaming," and "claiming to equalize grain."
    The "Guanxian County Chronicle" also says: "In the winter of the tenth year of Xianfeng, there was a famine. The villagers gathered crowds to resist the officials and make trouble over the grain transport. Local bandits took the opportunity to stir up trouble... They raised poles in response, divided into five-colored flags, gathered more than ten thousand people, secretly allied with the Southern Nian, and raised the flag of rebellion together." (Volume 10, Page 13)
    According to the "Guantao County Chronicle" (Volume 8, Pages 13 and 14), the flag numbers and the names of the peasant leaders were: Yellow Flag Zhang Shanji, Sun Quanren; Red Flag Gao Luowen, Zhang Zongkong; White Flag Cheng Shunshu, Shi Tianyu; Blue Flag Zuo Linming; Colored Flag Yang Pengling; Big Green Flag Yang Tai, Yang Fuling; Small Green Flag Lei Fengming, Wang Zhennan; Black Flag Song Jing-shi. According to the confessions of the reactionary ruling class, the cause was: "Since the government army and the Taiping Army were in a stalemate in the north and south of the Yangtze River, the Nian bandits in Henan and Shandong rose again, followed by the famine in the seventh year of Xianfeng, displaced refugees,...The stubborn people in various counties who practiced the Eight Trigrams Sect took the opportunity to rebel, divided into flags, and responded with colors." (Ibid.)
    First, let us look at the brief biography of Song Jing-shi written by the ruling class: "Song Jing-shi was from Xiaoli Guanzhuang (now Xiaoliu Guanzhuang - the author) in the northwest of Tangyi County. He often practiced boxing and was friendly with Wang Zhanji of Guantao County. Wang was imprisoned for a case,... Song and eighteen diehards robbed the prison,... They raised poles and started an uprising, calling themselves the Black Flag Team. Their numbers grew day by day and became uncontrollable." ("Linqing County Chronicle" Volume 1, Page 16)
    Let us now look at the truth of the uprising as told by the local peasants. In Xiao Ji, northwest of Tangyi County, we visited Xiao Hongfei, a 71-year-old who was formerly a poor peasant and is now a new middle peasant. He told us about the reasons for Song Jing-shi's rebellion that he had heard from his uncle: Song was a tofu seller, very poor, but he had learned excellent martial arts. At that time, the land in that area was divided into large grain land and small grain land. Good land paid large grain, while saline-alkali land paid small grain. The large grain was four hundred coins per mu, and the small grain was one hundred coins per mu. The Manchu Qing government, based on the request of the landlords, wanted to increase the small grain and decrease the large grain, but this was strongly opposed by the peasants. Because the large grain land was mostly in the hands of the landlords, while the vast majority of the small grain land was in the hands of poor and middle peasants. Increasing the small grain was tantamount to scraping the last bit of flesh off the peasants. Seeing that they could not survive, the peasants discussed resistance. Song Jing-shi actively participated in the resistance and became the leader. But soon Song was imprisoned in Guanxian prison. The peasants said that since Song Jing-shi was imprisoned for everyone, he had to be rescued. So they gathered eighteen people to rob the prison. After the prison break, they officially rebelled. They used market days to gather their comrades. After a few market days, they gathered eight or nine hundred people and started fighting.
    At this time, Wu Xun was doing "erecting tripods" and kowtowing, advocating so-called "begging for education."
    This old peasant from Xiao Ji also talked about the reasons for the opposition between Song Jing-shi's peasant army and Liulin Town. He said that Liulin was full of "good households" (landlords), and they were the ones who advocated "reducing large grain and increasing small grain." After the landlords in the fifty-two villages around Liulin were resisted by the peasants, they moved to Liulin, which had the strongest landlord armed force, the "militia," built high walls, and defended against the rebel peasants.
    The name of that "militia" was "Yongqing Regiment," and it was led by Yang Mingqian, the big landlord of Liulin, known as "Master Yang the Tenth." This regiment was much stronger than the other fourteen or fifteen regiments in Tangyi County. The following sentences from "A Brief Account of Military Affairs in Shandong" (Volume 14) can show the ruling class's distrust of the "militia" in that area at the time: "Shen, Tang, Guan, and Guan, the local militias feared disaster and conspired with the bandits.... The militia in Chaocheng, cooperating and dividing with the bandits, is also unpredictable." But the Liulin Regiment? It was called a "good regiment" ("Shandong General History"). At that time, there was also a saying among the landlord class: "The Liulin Regiment can kill and fight, the Fanzhai Regiment are heroes, the Huifeng Regiment is half private and half official, the Hougu Regiment are cowardly turtles, the Xiaotun Regiment scatters at the sight of the enemy." This shows that the landlord armed forces in Liulin and another village, Fanzhai, were the reactionary core; it also shows that Song Jing-shi's forces were strong, and the "militia" in various places were not their opponents, and even communicated with him and supplied food and grass, being "half private and half official." This was told to us by Guo Jiwu (new middle peasant), 79 years old, and Han Zhuling (middle peasant), 72 years old, of Liulin.
    Wu Zhuang, Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, and Liulin, northwest of Tangyi County, forty to fifty li away, are exactly three legs of a tripod on the map, roughly forming a triangle, and are very close to each other. Wu Zhuang is five li from Liulin, Wu Zhuang is seven li from Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, and Liulin is ten li from Xiaoliu Guanzhuang. Liulin in the southeast corner was the fortress of the landlords Yang Mingqian and their ilk, Xiaoliu Guanzhuang in the southwest corner was the starting point of Song Jing-shi and their uprising, and Wu Zhuang in the north was the home of Wu Xun. Song Jing-shi's uprising lasted for four years, from 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng) until it failed in 1863 (the second year of Tongzhi). In this year, Wu Xun was 25 years old and had been "begging for education" for five years. During this period, this area, including the rural areas of Liaocheng, Tangyi, Guanxian, Guantao, Shenxian, Shouzhang, Linqing and other counties, was involved in the whirlpool of intense class struggle. On one side were armed peasants resisting grain, attacking cities and occupying counties, "releasing prisoners and setting fire to warehouses, destroying military camps and government offices," "poor people transporting grain from granaries out of the city," and "those who followed the rebellion were like returning home" ("A Brief Account of Military Affairs in Shandong" Volume 12); on the other side were the army of the Manchu Qing autocratic dynasty and the landlords' "militia," guarding their walls and confronting the rebel peasants. Knife against knife, gun against gun, clear boundaries, irreconcilable. Wu Xun was 22 years old in the year of Song Jing-shi's uprising. He looked east to Liulin and west to Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, and decided to choose the road of Liulin. In order to cater to the landlord, gentry and Manchu Qing rulers' policy of "charity school" for fooling the people, he took "begging for education" as a signboard, relied on the landlord class and Manchu Qing bureaucrats, and became their docile slave.
    The laboring people's attitude towards these two "historical figures," Song Jing-shi and Wu Xun, is very clear. They admire and cherish the former, and despise and disdain the latter. They call the Black Flag "our Black Flag," and they call Wu Xun "Wu Doumo"!
    Like Xiao Hongfei, the other four old men in Xiao Ji, Xiao Zhenru (70 years old), Xiao Huaixiang (70 years old), Xiao Sihan (70 years old), and Xiao Guishu (64 years old) (they were all poor peasants in the past and are now new middle peasants), all praised Song Jing-shi's uprising. They talked about this historical hero with great animation. They said he "had good laws, only wanting fodder for the horses, not robbing or smashing."
    In Hou Lu Tang Village, east of Liulin, there is a 103-year-old man, Lu Yanlin (originally a tenant farmer, later a landlord, now a middle peasant. He was a contemporary of Wu Xun, only ten years younger than Wu Xun, and he was already 49 years old when Wu Xun died). When the Black Flag was in revolt, he was twelve years old and remembered things. Unfortunately, when we visited him, he was ill and not in good spirits. Especially about Wu Xun, he simply didn't have the energy to talk about it. But when we mentioned Song Jing-shi, he immediately became interested. After saying a few words, he struggled to sit up from the kang. He said excitedly: Song Jing-shi was a "poor boy, good at martial arts. He didn't attack Hougu, didn't attack Xiaotun, only attacked Liulin." "The Black Flag didn't rob or smash, only wanted food."
    Wang Licheng (81 years old), a poor peasant from the same village as Song Jing-shi, also praised the discipline of the Black Flag Army to us: "Song's soldiers were very disciplined. Song Jing-shi had orders: do not kill the people, do not rob the people. Do not pick flowers or steal willows, do not act recklessly. Anyone who messed around would be executed on the spot." Wang Licheng said that at that time the common people hated Liulin, which was a place where landlords were concentrated, and Song Jing-shi's attack on Liulin was most popular. Guo Jiwu and Han Zhuling, who were mentioned above, also remembered the Black Flag having these words: "Conquer the Liulin Regiment, eating will not be difficult, first kill the tenth regiment leader, then kill Bu Laoxian (also a landlord, from Qiaomiao - the author)."
    Yang Mingqian was the tenth in his family, so he was called "Tenth Regiment Leader." Song Jing-shi indeed defeated him on March 24, 1863 (the second year of Tongzhi) and killed him.
    Regarding the death of Yang Mingqian, there are some records on the "Yongqing Regiment Commander Yang Canjun Temple Stele" which is now lying in the Tangyi County Confucian Temple, serving as the steps of a school building there: "On March 24, seeing Song's rebel leading dozens of horsemen from afar on the wall, seemingly spying. The Duke immediately led a team of soldiers to pursue them, unexpectedly ambushed by the enemy, outnumbered,... fought bravely in a bloody battle, and all died."
    Pan Gengshen, a 70-year-old poor peasant, and Pan Gengli, a 78-year-old middle peasant, told us that they lived in Wang Er Zhai, only two li away from Xiaoliu Guanzhuang. At that time, more than sixty people from their village participated in the Black Flag. He said that almost all the adults in the village were "in the flag." Therefore, their village and Xiaoliu Guanzhuang were both called "bandit dens" by the rulers. They often heard stories about the "Black Flag Rebellion" from Wang Delai, an old man who had only died two years ago in the same village. At that time, Wang Delai was already more than ten years old, and because he was close to Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, he often went there to play. According to him, the process of Song Jing-shi's "clever plan to kill Master Yang the Tenth" was as follows: Song Jing-shi planted flags everywhere outside the south gate of Liulin, shouting to kill the enemy. Yang learned of this and went to the south gate. But Song arranged an ambush, using the built-up adobe bricks as cover. As soon as Yang came out, he fell into the ambush.
    Wang Weixiu, a 70-year-old middle peasant from Wang Fan Village south of Liulin, in addition to telling us that he had heard the old people praising how Song Jing-shi "killed the rich and helped the poor," he also remembered that Song had several famous brave generals under his command. For example: Han Er Bian Dan, who was on good terms with Song before the uprising; San Ba La Yan, who was illiterate but became Song's military advisor; Yang Er Ma Jian, a small man riding a big horse, "He wielded a Green Dragon Crescent Blade, hiding himself in the stirrups, only the horse was seen, not the man"; and Wang Bailing, Wang Erxiu, Wolf Head Jar, Meat Wings, etc., were all famous generals (the names Yang Er Ma Jian, Wolf Head Jar, Meat Wings, etc. are also found in the "Shandong General History"). He said: "Song had more than two thousand subordinates, with eight hundred heroes, all riding horses."
    Even the ruling class had to partially acknowledge the power of these peasant brave generals in folk legends. The "Guanxian County Chronicle" says that they "were skilled in martial arts, proficient in swordsmanship, brave and good at fighting, all a match for a hundred men" (Volume 10, Page 13). The "Shandong General History" also says: "The Black Flag led by Song Jing-shi mostly consisted of those who followed and learned spears and sticks. The number of people was large, and they knew a little about battle formations." (Volume 3, Page 3346)
    The Manchu Qing rulers called Song Jing-shi a "surrendered bandit" and a "rebellious bandit" because Song had a so-called period of being recruited. The "Guanxian County Chronicle" records that Song "begged to surrender to Sheng's camp" in May of the eleventh year of Xianfeng (Volume 10, Page 13). The "Linqing County Chronicle" also mentions that "In November of the eleventh year of Xianfeng, Sheng Bao attacked Song Jing-shi in the south of the Wei River and forced him to surrender" (Volume 1, Page 15). The eleventh year of Xianfeng was 1861. By the next year, the first year of Tongzhi, that is, November of 1862, "the surrendered bandit Song Jing-shi" "rebelled" again and expanded his activities, "returning to harass Guan, Guan, and Tangyi counties, and advancing to occupy the Chengying Street area of ​​the prefecture city (referring to Linqing - the author)" (Ibid.). In this battle, Song Jing-shi fought all the way from Jiao Zhuang in Guanxian to Linqing, and even entered the prefecture city, defeating the Qing army, "From then on, Song's power became more and more prosperous" (Ibid., Page 16). The "Guanxian County Chronicle" also recorded the situation after the "recruitment," saying that Song Jing-shi "did not listen to dispatch," "his rebellious traces were obvious," and "in name he was a government soldier, but in reality he was a jumping beam" (Volume 10, Page 15). The "Guantao County Chronicle" said that the scale of his uprising had further expanded, "all the flags were linked together, with tens of thousands of people" (Volume 8, Page 35). Why didn't the Qing army go to suppress him again? "But at that time, Sheng's (referring to Sheng Bao - the author) camp had already gone south to suppress the Nian, and could not look back. The Eastern Governor Tan (referring to Shandong Governor Tan Tingxiang - the author) still intended to appease and persuade them to help suppress the bandits." Obviously, the rulers at this time could only make some ineffective persuasion. The following sentences even more vividly depict their embarrassment: "Unable to control them, they could only tolerate them, hoping that they would not attack cities or rob prisons" (all from the "Guanxian County Chronicle" Volume 10, Page 15). But they did not get their wish, Song Jing-shi still "attacked cities and robbed prisons," and became better and better at fighting. This is not only what the peasants still say today, but also what the ruling class acknowledges. The five old men from Xiao Ji mentioned above said: "After Song Jing-shi came back, he became even better at fighting." The historians of the Manchu Qing ruling class unintentionally greatly praised Song Jing-shi's military prowess and greatly satirized the Qing army's cowardice: "When encountering government soldiers, they were accustomed to using the horizontal interception method. The government soldiers were caught off guard and could not take care of both the head and the tail. The Deputy Metropolitan Commander Zhekdunbu and the Battalion Officer Qian Xi especially feared the bandits like tigers. They always followed the bandits ten li away, the bandits moved, they moved, the bandits stopped, they stopped. At the time, people had the saying 'Qian doesn't fight, Zhe doesn't move.'" ("Guantao County Chronicle" Volume 8, Page 35)
    Another Qing general who was defeated by Song was Admiral Hengling, at Qingshui Town in Guanxian, in June 1863 (the second year of Tongzhi), exactly three months after Song Jing-shi killed Yang Mingqian. Wang Licheng excitedly recounted this victorious battle that is still circulating among the peasants of Xiaoliu Guanzhuang in his village: "Heng Daren (referring to Hengling - the author), the vanguard of Monk King (referring to Senggelinqin - the author), set up camp on the kiln two li outside of Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, using copper cannons to bombard the village. At that time, Song Jing-shi was not in Xiaoliu Guanzhuang, he was in Futou Village, thirty li away. The people of Xiaoliu Guanzhuang went to report. Song Jing-shi said: 'You just shout and shoot arrows in Xiaoliu Guanzhuang.' Then, Song Jing-shi went to抄后路, surrounded the Qing army from behind the village, killing Heng Daren and routing his army. Song Jing-shi alone could fight twenty men, no one around him dared to fight back, all were frightened."

    Finally, Senggelinqin and Zhili Governor-General Liu Changyou combined their forces to attack Song Jing-shi (Luo Ergang: "A Draft History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" Page 29), and Song Jing-shi was defeated by the autocratic dynasty's "foreign gun team" equipped with imperialist weapons. But in the initial engagements, this "Prince" still suffered defeats, and the "victory" he finally obtained was merely the so-called "Song Jing-shi's defeat and flight" in the "official history" ("Linqing County Chronicle" Volume 1, Page 15), and the Black Flag's clever retreat in the mouths of the laboring people. After listening to the conversations of the local old men, it is felt that the sentences in the "Linqing County Chronicle" are still realistic: "Song... caused trouble for four years. With the Monk's magnificent military power, he only barely defeated him, and never heard of him being annihilated." (Volume 1, Page 16)
    The 103-year-old man Lu Yanlin has a very good memory. He remembers that the Black Flag rebellion was when he was twelve years old, which is correct; he also remembers that "Monk King sent troops" in "August," which is also correct. The "Linqing County Chronicle" (Ibid.) says: "In August of the second year of Tongzhi, Senggelinqin supervised the troops to the state, and the rebel bandit Song Jing-shi fled in defeat."
    Lu Yanlin's description of the Qing general's underestimation of the enemy is very vivid: "In August, Monk King sent troops, saying 'The Black kids are not even good enough to fill the horse's hoofs,' and immediately set out to conquer, but was defeated in the first battle."
    Let us use the original words of Wang Licheng, whom we introduced earlier, to write down the final page of the battle record of that clever and warlike peasant revolutionary leader: "Heng Daren led his troops back to Liulin and reported to Monk King. Monk King had to personally lead five hundred red babies, riding red horses, wearing red robes, and firing foreign guns, to fight Song Jing-shi. Song could not resist the foreign guns and retreated to Xiaoliu Guanzhuang. He planted flags on the walls, issued battle declarations, prepared food at the third watch, and prepared to fight the enemy at the fourth watch; at the same time, he ordered all the villagers to take their belongings and leave. Monk King saw bright lights and candles on the walls, and heard the sound of gongs and drums, but did not see Song Jing-shi's soldiers come out. Monk King said: 'Why don't the Black kids come out to fight?' When it dawned, he ran close to the village and saw that the village gate was wide open, and there was no one inside!"
    The peasants we interviewed talked about the horrific atrocities committed by the Qing soldiers and the Liulin landlords' "militia," saying that there was "three days of looting," and many people were killed, frightened to death, and had their ears cut off. Many women from Xiaoliu Guanzhuang were robbed by the landlords of Liulin. People of Song Jing-shi's clan were either killed or their entire families fled to other provinces, changing their names and surnames, and their descendants did not dare to return to their hometown for several generations. We interviewed Song Keyi (51 years old, new middle peasant), who now lives in Zhao Lang Zhai. He is the grandson of Song Jing-shi's cousin. He said that his grandfather hid everywhere, but was finally found by the Liulin Regiment. The Liulin Regiment said that they could not let him die easily, and punished him by carrying extremely heavy sandbags, torturing him to death. His father, being a posthumous child, changed his surname to Chen after birth to survive. Another branch of his family fled to Wucheng County in Hebei, changed their names and surnames, and settled there.
    Wang Licheng also sadly talked about the cruel suppression and revenge suffered by Xiaoliu Guanzhuang after Song Jing-shi retreated. "After Song Jing-shi left, our village suffered. Everything within three li was wiped out. All eight qing of land in the village were confiscated and given to the Yang family of Liulin. The Yang family of Liulin then rented it to eleven households from other villages to farm in Xiaoliu Guanzhuang. The Yang family of Liulin leveled Song Jing-shi's ancestral graves, scattered the bones, and carried Song Jing-shi's father's coffin to Liulin. Song Jing-shi's mother was nailed alive to the gate of Dongchang Prefecture, with five nails, and did not die for two or three days..."
    At this time, Wu Xun was "begging for education", kowtowing to the enemies of the people!
    Regarding the ending of Song Jing-shi, the rulers' accounts vary. Some said that he "joined the Nian and fled south" ("Guanxian County Chronicle" Volume 10, Page 15). Some said that he "joined the rebel Lian Miao Peilin, and then joined the Nian bandit of Bozhou... In the tenth year of Tongzhi, General Liu Yongqing lured him to the state, bound him while he was drunk, and then executed him" ("Linqing County Chronicle" Volume 1, Page 16). Some said that in "the ninth year of Tongzhi... he used the pseudonym Xu Liansheng, traveling between Gui Xu Chen and Bo.... In February of the tenth year, Jing-shi was captured" ("Shandong General History" Volume 3, Page 3349).
    As for the common people's view, it is another matter. They fully expressed their longing for Song Jing-shi. Wang Licheng, a fellow villager of Song Jing-shi, told us that this "Song Yatou" (the peasants said that Song Jing-shi usually did not talk much and was as quiet as a woman, but when fighting, he was the bravest in the entire army. It is suspected that this name came about in this way), who was loved by the peasants, finally "ran west! All the way to the outside of the pass, changed his name and surname, settled in Guihua County, taught a hundred apprentices, and lived to be eighty years old."
    Sun Yu, a eulogist of Wu Xun, fabricated a pseudo-revolutionary peasant Zhou Da in the movie to compare with Wu Xun, and insisted that Zhou Da and Wu Xun had a friendly relationship, even a like-minded relationship, and called them "one civil and one military." But from the "specific historical" facts, it is obvious that there is no similarity between the revolutionary peasants and the slaves of the ruling class who oppose the revolution. If Wu Xun's eulogists must praise Wu Xun as "one civil," then the "one military" who can match him is not someone else, but Yang Mingqian, the head of the Liulin Regiment, and his successor, his nephew, that is, Wu Xun's benefactor, Yang Shufang, who was the enemy of Song Jing-shi and helped the Manchu Qing rulers massacre the peasants. Yang Shufang, who was rewarded with eight qing of land in Xiaoliu Guanzhuang for his uncle's meritorious service in "suppressing bandits" and bloody washing Xiaoliu Guanzhuang of Song Jing-shi, was the one who promoted Wu Xun, built the first "charity school" for Wu Xun in Liulin, and was praised by Sun Yu and Li Shizhao as one of the "enlightened gentry." Wu Xun and Song Jing-shi were irreconcilable enemies, and Wu Xun and Yang Mingqian or Yang Shufang were "one civil and one military," blood relatives who spoke with one voice. Very reasonably, Wu Xun and Yang Mingqian were both praised by the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Wu Xun was given the award "Happy to Do Good Deeds," and after his death, it was announced that he would be included in the National History Museum to write his biography. Yang Mingqian was posthumously awarded the title of "Luan Yiwei," and "a special ancestral hall was built for him, and public sacrifices were held in spring and autumn," and his descendants also received the title of "Hereditary Yunqiwei." They are worthy of being two loyal running dogs who served the reactionary rulers, helped the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and implemented the so-called pacification policy against the revolutionary people!

    Liulin was a landlord fortress during Wu Xun's time. The landlords of the surrounding fifty-two villages gathered in this enclosure to resist Song Jing-shi's peasant revolutionary army. Yang Mingqian, the uncle of Wu Xun's "benefactor" Yang Shufang, was the leader of the Liulin "militia" and was killed by Song.

　　武训历史调查记（续）
    武训历史调查团
  （一）和武训同时的当地农民革命领袖宋景诗
    武训的歌颂者曾经指摘人们“缺乏历史唯物主义的观点”，“错误”地把“今天的尺度”去衡量“历史上的人物”；并且说，武训受了“具体的历史条件的限制”，是不可能有革命的思想和行动的。经过人们指出武训所处的具体历史环境，正是太平天国和北方捻军的农民大革命时代以后，某些歌颂武训的人们还是不甚心悦诚服，理由是那些革命军究竟不是起于武训家乡的，虽在武训家乡打过仗，总是外地人，其没有引起武训注意，还是情有可原的。
    我们的调查发现了武训家乡的革命军。他们不是太平军，也不是捻军，而是和捻军有联系的武训家乡的地方性的农民革命军。这种事实，使我们能够提供一个“具体的历史条件”和一些“历史上的人物”，作为大家判断的根据。有了这些事实，我们就不难答复：究竟是谁“缺乏历史唯物主义的观点”？是批判武训、蔑视武训的人们呢，还是宣传武训、歌颂武训的人们呢？
    我们所得的“具体的历史条件”和“历史上的人物”是这样的：
    一八六○年（咸丰十年），正当武训打出“乞行兴学”招牌（据从前的记载，武训生于一八三八年，即道光十八年，武训开始打出这块招牌是在一八五九年，即咸丰九年，武训二十一岁）一年以后，即当武训二十二岁的时候，堂邑、馆陶、临清、冠县一带广大地区爆发了与捻军有联系的农民起义。就在武训出生的堂邑县柳林镇武庄西南七里的小刘贯庄上，产生了一个农民革命领袖宋景诗。他领导的农民武装叫黑旗军。并且就在武庄一带，黑旗军曾与满清政府大将科尔沁亲王僧格林沁的军队“大战”过。（《临清县志》第一册第十六页）
    同时同地存在着两个截然不同的人物：一个向地主阶级、封建统治者投降，一个对地主阶级、封建统治者进行革命；一个被当时和以后的反动统治阶级所一贯地加以培养、粉饰和歌颂，一个被当时的反动统治阶级所诬蔑、镇压和剿杀；一个被当时以至现在的劳动人民所轻视和鄙恶，一个被当时以至现在的劳动人民所拥护和敬爱。前一个就是武训，后一个就是宋景诗。
    当时山东的堂邑、馆陶、临清、冠县一带的农民，成千成万地卷进了轰轰烈烈的革命浪潮。但武训没有，他不但脱离了这个浪潮，而且跑去依附了镇压农民的垂死的压迫阶级。宋景诗则投入了这个巨大的浪潮，并且成了当地农民群众的最有名的领袖，站在历史时代的最前面。
    这些起义虽则以各种宗教的名义出现，如白莲教、八卦教、幅教等，但其本质都是由于社会阶级矛盾日益深刻而爆发起来的农民革命。土地的集中，剥削的加重，加上主要是人为的因素所造成的灾荒，使陷于痛苦深渊中的农民，勇敢地组织起来，向反动统治阶级宣战。在《临清县志》（第一册第十四、五页）上，我们可以看到，在武训所生活着的年代里，那一带地区曾连年不断地发生灾荒。武训生的那一年，道光十八年（一八三八年），“螟虫伤稼”，二十二年是雹，二十四年是水，二十六年是旱、风，二十八年是大水；咸丰七年是“飞蝗蔽天，禾稼都尽，大饥”，八年又是“大饥，人食麦苗，大疫”；光绪元年又是“大饥”，二年“大旱”，三年“大饥”，四年“大饥”。和这些并列的，是“粤匪”、“教匪”、“捻匪”、“贼”……四处“蔓延”、“窜扰”、“声言均粮”等记载。
    《冠县县志》上也这样说：“咸丰十年冬，岁饥。乡众聚众抗官闹漕，土匪乘机蠢动，……揭竿响应，旗分五色，乌合万余人，暗结南捻，同举反旗。”（第十卷第十三页）
    那些旗号和农民领袖的姓名，据《馆陶县志》（第八册第十三、四页）所载为：黄旗张善继、孙全仁；红旗郜洛文、张宗孔；白旗程顺书、石天雨；蓝旗左临明；花旗杨朋岭；大绿旗杨泰、杨福龄；小绿旗雷凤鸣、王振南；黑旗宋景诗。照反动统治阶级的供述，其起因是：“自官军与太平军相持于大江南北，河南、山东捻匪又起，继以咸丰七年之凶荒，流民失所，……各县顽民有习八卦教者，乘机作乱，分张旗帜，以应方色。”（同上书同页）
    先让我们来看统治阶级所写的宋景诗的略传：“宋景诗堂邑县西北小李官庄（即现在小刘贯庄——笔者）人，常习拳棒，与馆陶县王占基友善。王因案系狱，……宋与死党十八人劫狱，……揭竿而起，号黑旗队。其众日多，遂不可制。”（《临清县志》第一册第十六页）
    再让我们来看当地农民所说的起义真相究竟是怎样。在堂邑县西北的萧集，我们访问了一个过去是贫农，现为新中农的七十一岁的萧洪飞。他告诉我们他从自己叔父那儿听来的关于宋景诗造反的缘由：宋是一个卖豆腐的，很穷，但学得一手好武艺。当时那一带的田地，有大粮地和小粮地的区别。缴大粮的是好地，缴小粮的是沙碱地。大粮地每亩四百钱，小粮地每亩一百钱。满清政府依据地主的请求，要增加小粮，减低大粮，但大遭农民反对。因为大粮地多数是在地主手里，小粮地的绝大部分却在贫农和中农手里。增加小粮，对农民说来，无异要刮削他们身上最后一点肉。农民眼看不能活命，就商量反抗。宋景诗积极参加反抗，成了头儿。但不久宋被关进冠县牢里。农民们说，宋景诗既然为大家坐牢，不能不救。于是集合了十八个人去劫狱。劫狱出来就正式造反。他们利用赶集，集合同党。不多几集，就约齐了八九百人，干起来了。
    这时的武训却在干“竖鼎”和磕头的玩艺儿，提倡所谓“行乞兴学”。
    这个萧集的老农民还讲了宋景诗的农民队伍和柳林镇对立的原因。他说，柳林尽是“好户”（地主），他们就是主张“减低大粮，增加小粮”的。柳林周围五十二个村庄的地主遭到了农民的反抗以后，纷纷搬到拥有当时最顽强的地主武装“民团”的柳林去，高筑起围子，防御起义农民。
    那个“民团”的名称叫“永清团”，由柳林大地主“杨十爷”即杨鸣谦当团长。这个团，比起堂邑境内其他十四、五个团来，要顽强得多。《山东军兴纪略》（卷十四）中有下面几句话可以显示当时统治阶级对那一带的“民团”的不信任：“莘、堂、冠、馆，乡团畏祸，与匪首鼠。……朝城民团，与匪分合，亦不可测。”而柳林团呢？却被称为“良团”（《山东通志》）。在当时地主阶级间，也流传这样的话：“柳林团能杀能战，樊寨团英雄好汉，惠丰团半私半官，堠堌团熊种王八蛋，小囤团见面就散。”这说明了柳林和另一个村庄樊寨两处的地主武装是反动的核心；也说明了宋景诗他们的力量是强大的，各地“民团”均非其敌，甚至还和他互通声气，供给粮草，“半私半官”。这是柳林七十九岁的郭继武（新中农）、七十二岁的韩祝龄（中农）告诉我们的。
    堂邑县城西北四、五十里的武庄、小刘贯庄、柳林，在地图上恰好鼎足而三，大体上成一个三角形，相距很近。武庄距柳林五里，武庄距小刘贯庄七里，柳林距小刘贯庄十里。东南角的柳林是地主杨鸣谦他们的堡垒，西南角的小刘贯庄是宋景诗他们的起义地点，北边的武庄是武训的家。宋景诗的起义从一八六○年（咸丰十年）起，连续四年，直到一八六三年（同治二年）才失败。这一年武训是二十五岁，闹了五年的“行乞兴学”了。在这期间，这一带，包括聊城、堂邑、冠县、馆陶、莘县、寿张、临清等好几个县的农村，都卷入了激烈的阶级斗争漩涡。一边是农民武装抗粮，攻城占县，“发狱火库，毁武营、官廨”，“穷民运廒粟出城”，“从乱者如归”（《山东军兴纪略》卷十二）；一边是满清专制王朝的军队和地主的“民团”，据守围子，和起义农民对抗。刀对刀，枪对枪，壁垒分明，水火不容。武训在宋景诗起义那一年是二十二岁，他东望柳林，西望小刘贯庄，决定选择了柳林的道路。为了迎合当时地主、绅士和满清统治者举办“义学”的愚民政策起见，他以“行乞兴学”为招牌，投靠了地主阶级和满清官僚，成了他们的驯顺的奴才。
    对于宋景诗和武训这两个“历史上的人物”，劳动人民的态度是十分清楚的。他们对前者是钦佩的，怀念的；对后者是蔑视的，不屑一谈的。他们称黑旗为“咱黑旗”，他们称武训为“武豆沫”！
    和萧洪飞一样，萧集的另外四个老人，七十岁的萧振如，七十岁的萧怀祥，七十岁的萧泗汉，六十四岁的萧桂树（他们过去都是贫农，现在都是新中农），也都称颂宋景诗的起义，他们眉飞色舞地谈着这个历史上的英雄人物。他们说他“王法好，光要草料吃头，不抢不砸”。
    在柳林东面的后路堂村，有一个一百零三岁的老人路延林（最初是佃户，后为地主，现为中农。他是武训同时代的人物，他比武训只小十岁，在武训死的那一年他已四十九岁），在闹黑旗时，他已十二岁，记事儿了。不凑巧，当我们访问他时，他刚有病，精神不行。特别是关于武训的事，他简直没有劲讲。可是当我们一提到宋景诗的时候，他的兴致马上来了。说了几句之后，竟挣扎着从炕上坐了起来。他兴奋地说：宋景诗是“穷儿，好拳脚。他堠堌不打，小囤不打，单打柳林”。“黑旗不抢不砸，只要吃的。”
    和宋景诗同村的贫农王立成（八十一岁）也向我们夸奖黑旗军的纪律：“宋兵可有规矩。宋景诗有命令：不杀百姓，不抢百姓。不采花盗柳，不胡作非为。有乱来的，就地正法。”王立成说，那时候老百姓对柳林有仇，柳林是地主集中的地方，宋景诗打柳林最得人心。上面已经提到过的郭继武和韩祝龄还记得黑旗有这样几句话：“攻克柳林团，吃饭不作难，先杀十团长，后杀步老先（也是一个地主，乔庙人——笔者）。”
    杨鸣谦行十，故号“十团长”。宋景诗在一八六三年（同治二年）三月二十四日果然打败了他，把他杀死。
    关于杨鸣谦的死，现在躺倒在堂邑县文庙里，做了那儿一所学校校舍台阶的“永清团团长杨参军庙碑”上有些记载：“三月二十四日在圩墙遥见宋逆带领数十骑，似来谍状。公即率丁一队往追，不意伏贼突出，众寡不敌，……奋力血战，遂俱死。”
    今年七十岁的贫农潘耕申和七十八岁的中农潘耕历，告诉我们，他们所住的王二砦，离小刘贯庄只二里地。当时，他们村上参加黑旗的有六十多人，他说，差不多村上所有的壮年人都是“在旗”的。因此，他们的村和小刘贯庄，同被统治者称为“贼窝”。他们从同村的一个才死了二年的老年人王德来的嘴里，时常听到关于“黑旗反”的故事。那时，王德来已有十几岁，因为离小刘贯庄近，所以时常去玩。据他谈，宋景诗“巧计杀杨十爷”的经过是这样：宋景诗在柳林南门外遍插旗帜，叫喊杀敌，杨得知就去南门。但宋布置了伏兵，利用垒起的土坯作掩护。杨一出来，就中了埋伏。
    在柳林南面的王樊庄的七十岁的中农王维修，除了告诉我们，他曾经听见老人们称赞宋景诗怎样“杀富济贫”外，他还记得宋手下有几个出名勇将。例如：起义前就和宋相好的憨二扁担；一字不识，却当了宋的军师的三疤拉眼；小个子，骑大马的杨二马鞯，“他耍一把青龙偃月刀，蹬里藏身，只见马，不见人”；还有王百灵、王二秀、狼头罐、肉翅膀等，都是名将（杨二马鞯、狼头罐、肉翅膀等名字也见之于《山东通志》）。他说：“宋部下共两千多人，有八百好汉，都骑马。”
    民间传说的这些农民勇将的力量，即使是统治阶级也不得不加以部分的承认。《冠县县志》说他们“精技击，娴刀法，有勇惯战，皆百人敌”（第十卷第十三页）。《山东通志》也说：“宋景诗所领黑旗，多相从习学枪棒之徒，人数既多，略知阵法。”（第三卷，第三三四六页）
    满清统治者称宋景诗为“降匪”、“叛匪”，是由于宋曾一度有所谓受招抚的事。《冠县县志》载，咸丰十一年五月宋《乞降胜营》（第十卷第十三页）。《临清县志》中也提到，“咸丰十一年冬十一月，胜保击宋景诗于卫河南，降之”（第一册第十五页）。咸丰十一年是一八六一年，到次年同治元年，即一八六二年的十一月，《降匪宋景诗》却“复叛”了，并且扩大了活动，“回扰冠、馆、堂邑等县，进踞州城（指临清——笔者）车营街一带”（同上书同页）。这一仗，宋景诗从冠县的焦庄一直打到临清，并且打进了州城，大败清兵，“自此宋声势愈炽”（同上书第十六页）。“招抚”以后的情况，《冠县县志》也有记载，说宋景诗“不听调遣”，“叛迹显著”，“名为官军，实是跳梁”（第十卷第十五页）。《馆陶县志》则说他的起义规模更加扩大，“各旗联络，有数万人”（第八册第三十五页）。为什么清兵不又去剿呢？“惟时胜（指胜保——笔者）营已南行剿捻，不克回顾，东抚谭（指山东巡抚谭廷襄——笔者）仍有慰抚劝令助剿之意。”很明显，这时的统治者只能作一些无效的劝说。下面几句更活画出他们的窘相：“力不能制，优容姑息，只得以不攻城劫狱为幸”（均见《冠县县志》第十卷第十五页）。可是他们没有如愿，宋景诗还是“攻城劫狱”，并且越来越会打仗。这不但是农民至今还这样传说，并且也是统治阶级所承认的。上面所提到的萧集的五个老年人就说：“宋景诗回来以后，更会打仗了。”满清统治阶级的历史家则无意中大大赞美了宋景诗的善战，和大大讽刺了清兵的怯弱：“遇官军惯用横截法。官军猝不及防，即首尾不能相顾。副都统遮克敦布、营官谦禧，尤畏贼如虎。蹑贼常在十里外，贼行亦行，贼止亦止。时人有‘谦不打，遮不动’之谣。”（《馆陶县志》第八册第三十五页）
    另一个败在宋手里的清将是提督恒龄，地点在冠县清水镇，时间是一八六三年（同治二年）六月，正是宋景诗杀死杨鸣谦之后三个月。王立成兴奋地讲述至今还流传在他村子小刘贯庄农民中间的这一场胜利的战斗：“僧王（指僧格林沁——笔者）的前锋恒大人（指恒龄——笔者）在小刘贯庄外二里地窑上扎营，用铜炮轰。那时候，宋景诗不在小刘贯庄，他在三十里外的幞头村。小刘贯庄的人去报信。宋景诗说：‘你们只顾在小刘贯庄喊杀放箭。’接着，宋景诗就去抄后路，从村后去包围了清兵，杀得恒大人落花流水。宋景诗一个人能敌二十个，周围的人哪敢回手，个个吓迷了。”
    最后，僧格林沁和直隶总督刘长佑合军攻宋景诗（罗尔纲：《太平天国史稿》第二十九页），宋景诗才败于专制王朝的、以帝国主义武装来装备的、所谓“拐子洋枪队”。但在交手的初期，这个“亲王”也还是吃了败仗，而最后他所得到的“胜利”，也仅仅是“正史”上的所谓“宋景诗败走”（《临清县志》第一册第十五页），和劳动人民口中的黑旗的巧妙的撤退。听了当地老人们的谈话之后，觉得《临清县志》上的几句文章还算是记实的：“宋……为患四年，以僧邸军威之盛，仅乃胜之，卒未闻被歼。”（第一册第十六页）
    那一百零三岁的老人路延林的记忆力真好。他记得黑旗反是在他十二岁的时候，那是不错的；他也记得“僧王发兵”是在“八月里”，那也是不错的。《临清县志》（同上页）说：“同治二年秋八月，僧格林沁督兵至州，叛匪宋景诗败走。”
    路延林形容清将的轻敌，很是生动：“到八月里，僧王发兵，说‘黑小子们不够垫马蹄子’，立马出征，可是头一仗就打败了。”
    让我们用前面曾经介绍过的王立成的原话，来给那聪明善战的农民革命领袖写下他的最后一页的战绩吧：“恒大人带兵逃回柳林，禀告僧王。僧王只得自己亲带五百红孩儿，骑红马，穿红袍，打洋枪，来打宋景诗。宋吃不住洋枪，退到了小刘贯庄。他一面在围子上插旗，下战表，三更造饭，四更对敌，准备打仗；一面叫全村人带起东西走。僧王看见围子上明灯亮烛，并且听见一片敲锣打鼓的声音，却不见宋景诗的兵出来。僧王说：‘黑小子为什么不出战？’等到天明，他跑近寨子一看，但见寨门大开，里面一个人也没有了！”
    我们所访问的农民们谈到了当时清兵和柳林地主“民团”所进行的恐怖暴行，说是“大抢三日”，许多人被杀死，吓死，割去耳朵。小刘贯庄妇女不少被柳林的地主们抢走。和宋景诗同族的人，不是被杀，便是全家逃亡外省，从此改名换姓，子孙几代都不敢回原籍。我们访问过现住赵郎砦的宋克义（五十一岁，新中农），他是宋景诗堂兄弟的孙子。他说他的祖父到处躲藏，最后还是被柳林团搜出来了。柳林团说不能叫他好死，罚他驮极重的沙袋，活活折磨死了。他的父亲因是遗腹子，出世以后即改姓陈，才保留下来。他家另一支逃到河北的武城县，改名换姓，就在那儿落了户。
    王立成也很难受地谈到宋景诗撤退后，小刘贯庄受地主的残酷镇压和报复的情形。“宋景诗走了以后，俺村遭了殃。三里以内，给洗了。全村八顷地入了官，给了柳林杨家。柳林杨家又租给别村的十一户来小刘贯庄种地。柳林杨家把宋景诗家的祖坟平了，撒了骨，把宋景诗爹的棺材也抬到柳林去。把宋景诗的娘活钉在东昌府城门上，五只钉子，两三天才死。……”
    这时候，武训却在闹“行乞兴学”，向人民的敌人磕头！
    关于宋景诗的结局，统治者的说法不一。有的说他“投捻南奔”（《冠县县志》第十卷第十五页）。有的说他“投叛练苗沛霖，又投亳州捻匪……同治十年总兵刘永清诱至州，醉而缚之，乃伏诛”（《临清县志》第一册第十六页）。有的说他在“同治九年……假名徐连升，往来归徐陈亳之间。……十年二月获景诗”（《山东通志》第三卷第三三四九页）。
    至于农民群众的说法，那是另一种。他们对宋景诗，充分流露了他们的怀念之情。宋景诗的同村人王立成告诉我们，这个为农民爱戴的“宋丫头”（农民们说，宋景诗平日说话不多，闲静如女子，打起仗来却勇冠全军。这个名称疑是这样说开的）最后是“往西跑啦！一直跑到口外，改名换姓，在桂花县落户，教了一百个徒弟，活到八十岁。”
    武训的歌颂者孙瑜曾在电影中捏造一个似是而非的革命农民周大，来和武训相比，并硬说周大和武训有友谊关系，甚至是志同道合的关系，而称之为“一文一武”。但是从“具体的历史”事实看，很明显的，革命农民与反对革命的统治阶级的奴才，是没有丝毫相同之处的。如果武训的歌颂者一定要把武训捧为“一文”，那么，那堪与匹配的“一武”，不是别人，正是与宋景诗为敌，帮助满清统治者屠杀农民的柳林团团长杨鸣谦及其继任者——他的亲侄亦即武训的恩主——杨树坊。因叔父“剿匪”、血洗宋景诗的小刘贯庄有功而被赏赐小刘贯庄八顷地的杨树坊，正是提拔武训，替武训在柳林修第一所“义学”，被孙瑜、李士钊们捧为“开明绅士”之一的那个人。武训和宋景诗是势不两立的敌对者，武训和杨鸣谦或杨树坊才是“一文一武”，一鼻孔出气的血缘亲属。非常合理，武训和杨鸣谦一同受到了满清王朝的褒奖，武训被赐与“乐善好施”奖语，死后宣付国史馆立传。杨鸣谦死后受封为“銮仪卫”，“建立专祠，春秋公祭”，他的后代也获得“世袭云骑尉”的封号。他们不愧为替反动统治者服务，帮助满清王朝，对革命人民执行所谓剿抚兼施政策的两匹忠实的走狗！

    柳林老人谈宋景诗
    柳林镇（即“武训镇”）城关
    柳林在武训时期是地主堡垒，周围五十二个村子的地主集中在这个围子里抵抗宋景诗的农民革命军。武训“恩主”杨树坊之叔杨鸣谦就是柳林“民团”的团长，为宋所杀。
