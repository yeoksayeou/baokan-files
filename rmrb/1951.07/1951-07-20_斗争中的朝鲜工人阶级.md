　　The Korean Working Class in Struggle
　　Li Mu
    In the great war against the American aggressors, the Korean working class has always stood at the forefront of the struggle, becoming the vanguard force of the Korean people against aggression, defending the fatherland, and defending peace. The heroic struggle of the workers of a factory in northern Korea is a shining example. This factory was awarded the First Class National Flag Order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for its important contributions to the cause of national liberation.
    Last autumn, when the American aggressor troops landed in Incheon and ventured to advance north, the workers of the factory, with incomparable hatred and firm confidence in victory, dispersed and hid all the important machines. They took a few belongings with them and temporarily bid farewell to their beloved workshops. More than a thousand young workers were organized into armed forces and heroically went to the front lines, while the majority of the remaining workers were transferred north in an organized manner.
    The day the workers had been expecting day and night finally arrived when the Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the Yalu River and, together with the Korean People's Army, crushed the offensive of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs, liberating vast areas, including the location of this factory. When the Korean and Chinese people's forces had not yet arrived at the factory site, the American and Syngman Rhee troops fled at the mere sight of them, but the "security forces" of the Syngman Rhee gang were still harassing the area. At this time, Jin Mingxian, the head of the factory's production section, led six fellow workers into the factory, preventing the "security forces" and saboteurs from stealing the factory's materials, heroically protecting the factory. Jin Mingxian was therefore awarded the Third Class National Flag Order by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    With the victorious southward advance of the Korean and Chinese people's forces, workers returned to their workshops batch by batch. They worked intensely and excitedly in the harsh winter to reorganize the factory. After being looted by the American and Syngman Rhee gangs, most of the workers' families were left with almost nothing; many workers had no cotton clothes to wear, wore ragged shoes, and ate cornmeal. But they still worked day and night. In the dark workshops, by the dim light of oil lamps, they spent twenty days repairing all the machine channels, circuits, and water pipes. They cleared out the empty cans, bullet casings, and excrement left by the American troops in the factory, and leveled the main road. When the lights came on again and the machines roared again, this factory gloriously shouldered the great task of supporting the front lines.
    The factory's cooperative resumed business, supplying sickles, hoes, soap, salt, etc., and also opened a rice mill. Barber shops, shoe repair shops, tofu workshops, and bathhouses were also opened. The workers also planted 24,000 pyeong (approximately 80 mu) of vegetables.
    The workers remembered every moment that there were still millions of compatriots living in misery under the iron heel of the American beasts, and that American air pirates still wreaked havoc over peaceful villages from time to time. Therefore, their will to defend peace was as strong as steel. All the employees of the factory signed the declaration in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact. They loved the heroic fighting Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who liberated their homeland and defended their happiness. They are supporting the war with all their strength.
    The front-line victory reports posted along the factory road and the news of the support from the people of various fraternal countries greatly inspired the workers' enthusiasm for production. They worked hard for twelve hours a day. The "Youth Support the Front Line Vocational Class" (equivalent to a production team) in the factory held meetings every day to study how to better complete production tasks. They launched a production competition in full swing. Workers Zhao Yongtian and Shi Yingtong each watched two machines, and in May they completed 210 percent of their production tasks respectively. The American and Syngman Rhee gangs brutally killed six members of female worker Jin Shunv's family except for herself. In order to avenge her relatives, she overfulfilled her production task by 250 percent. Worker Zhang Changxian continuously maintained 100 percent attendance, and the factory awarded him 1,500 Korean won, which he donated in full as a contribution to purchasing airplanes.
    In order to train technical workers, the factory management held business and technical training classes. During "World Youth Week," the factory launched a ten-day technical learning campaign. Workers studied hard day and night. During these ten days, 114 apprentices were promoted to technicians, 33 third-level technicians were promoted to fourth-level technicians, and 41 fourth-level technicians were promoted to fifth-level technicians. Many People's Army veterans who were discharged due to injuries also mastered technology and gloriously continued to perform meritorious service for the people of the motherland on the production front.

### 斗争中的朝鲜工人阶级

　　斗争中的朝鲜工人阶级
　　李牧
    在伟大的反对美国侵略者的战争中，朝鲜的工人阶级始终站在斗争的前线，成为朝鲜人民反对侵略、保卫祖国、保卫和平的先锋力量。朝鲜北部某地一个工厂的职工们英勇斗争的事迹，就是一个光辉的例子。这个工厂由于对祖国解放事业有着重要的贡献，因而荣获了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一级国旗勋章。
    去年秋天，当美国侵略军在仁川登陆、冒险向北进犯的时候，该厂工人们怀着无比的仇恨和坚定的胜利信心，将全部重要机器分散隐藏起来。他们随身带了点东西，暂时告别了自己心爱的车间。一千多个青年工人编组成武装部队，英勇地开赴前线，其余大部分职工有组织地向北转移。
    工人们日夜期望着的回到工厂去的一天终于来到了。中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江，和朝鲜人民军一起打垮了美、李匪帮的进攻，解放了广大地区，也解放了这一个工厂的所在地。当朝、中人民部队还未到达工厂所在地时，美、李匪军望风而逃，可是李匪帮的“治安队”还在四处骚扰。这时候，该厂生产股长金明先率领了六个工友进入工厂，制止了“治安队”和破坏分子盗窃该厂物资，英勇地保护了工厂。金明先因此而荣获了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府颁发的三级国旗勋章。
    随着朝、中人民部队的胜利南进，工人们一批一批地回到了自己的车间。他们在严冬里紧张而兴奋地整理着工厂。工人们的家庭在遭到美、李匪帮的洗劫以后，已十室九空；许多工人没有棉衣穿，穿着破烂的鞋子，吃着苞米饭。可是他们仍然日以继夜地工作着。他们在漆黑的工作场里，借着微弱的油灯灯光，费了二十天时间，把全部机器通道、电路、自来水管都修理好了。他们清除了美军在工厂里留下的空罐头盒、子弹壳和粪便，修平了大道。当电灯又亮起来，机器又隆隆地响起来的时候，这一个工厂又光荣地担负起了支援前线的伟大任务。
    工厂里的合作社恢复了营业，供应着镰刀、锄头、肥皂、食盐等，并且还开办了碾米厂。理发馆和修鞋店、豆腐作坊和洗澡塘也都开了起来。工人们还种了二万四千坪（按每三百坪等于中国一市亩）的菜蔬。
    工人们每时每刻都记得还有千万个同胞在美国野兽的铁蹄下过着苦难的日子，美国空中强盗还不时在和平村庄上空逞凶。因此，他们保卫和平的意志，是像钢铁一样坚强。全厂职工都在拥护订立五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。他们热爱着解放了他们的家园、保卫着他们的幸福的英勇战斗的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。他们正以一切力量支援着战争。
    张贴在工厂道旁的前线捷报和各兄弟国家人民支援的消息，极大地鼓舞了工人们的生产热情。他们每天劳动十二小时，紧张地工作着。工厂中的“青年支援前线职业班”（相当于生产小组）每天开会研究怎样更好地完成生产任务。他们热火朝天地展开了生产竞赛。工人赵用天和石瀛统每个人看两台机器，五月份他们分别完成了生产任务的百分之二百一十和百分之二百。女工金顺女一家六口除了她自己外都被美、李匪军惨杀了，她为了给自己的亲人报仇，超额完成生产任务百分之二百五十。工人张昌现连续保持百分之百的出勤率，工厂奖给了他一千五百元朝鲜币，他又全数捐出来作为购买飞机的献金。
    工厂管理当局为了培养技术工人，举办了业务技术学习班。在“世界青年周”期间，全厂展开了十天的学习技术运动。工人们日夜勤学苦练。在这十天当中，就有一百一十四名养成工升为技工，三十三名三级技工升为四级技工，四十一名四级技工升为五级技工。有不少因伤退伍的人民军战士也都掌握了技术，光荣地在生产战线上继续为祖国人民立功。（新华社）
