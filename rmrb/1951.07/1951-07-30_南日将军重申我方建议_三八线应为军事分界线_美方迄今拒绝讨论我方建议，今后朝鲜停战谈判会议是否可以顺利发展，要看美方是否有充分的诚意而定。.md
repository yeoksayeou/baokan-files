　　General Nam Il Reiterates Our Proposal
　  The 38th Parallel Should Be the Military Demarcation Line
　  The US Side Has Thus Far Refused to Discuss Our Proposal; Whether the Korean Armistice Negotiation Conference Can Develop Smoothly in the Future Depends on Whether the US Side Has Sufficient Sincerity.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th] Our correspondent learned from the headquarters on the Korean front: The 13th meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Conference began at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on July 29th. At 3:05 PM, the United Nations Command delegation suggested a recess. The 14th meeting is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on July 30th.
    The thirteenth meeting continued to discuss the issue of establishing a military demarcation line by both sides to establish a demilitarized zone.
    General Nam Il, chief representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, explained again at the meeting on the morning of the 29th that our specific proposal to take the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line for both sides, and for both sides to withdraw ten kilometers from the 38th parallel to establish a demilitarized zone, not only conforms to the military reality of the Korean battlefield, is fair and reasonable to both sides, but also facilitates the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and serves as the foundation for this armistice negotiation. General Nam Il pointed out that any attempt to boast about the effectiveness of naval and air force bombing to gain a unilaterally advantageous combat position is not an attitude that should be present in armistice negotiations.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 29th] Our special correspondent reports: After ten meetings of discussions in the Korean Armistice Negotiation Conference, both sides have reached an agreement on the agenda and, after adopting the agenda at the meeting on the afternoon of July 26th, proceeded to discuss the second item on the agenda.
    The discussion on the agenda of this armistice negotiation conference lasted seventeen days, from the beginning on July 10th to the reaching of an agreement, with the actual meeting time totaling only twenty-one hours and forty minutes. During the discussion, the meetings were adjourned seven times due to the US side using pretexts such as reporter interviews and designating Kaesong as a neutral zone, as well as differing opinions between the two sides on several agenda items. It was only after the representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fully expressed their sincerity in the armistice negotiations and repeatedly made concessions on several issues, that the discussion on the agenda was quickly completed with an agreement.
    People know that just two days after the armistice negotiation conference began, Joye and Ridgway used the pretexts of news reporters interviewing in Kaesong and designating Kaesong as a temporary neutral zone to suspend the meeting for three days. In order to eliminate misunderstandings and disputes on some minor issues and to ensure the smooth progress of the peace talks, our side expressed its agreement in principle to designate the Kaesong area as a temporary neutral zone during the meeting, and also provided the US side with convenience regarding the issue of news reporter interviews. This eliminated all the pretexts put forward by the US side and allowed the armistice negotiation conference to resume on July 15th.
    On the agenda, the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea became the main issue of disagreement between the two sides. At the first meeting held on July 10th, General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side, briefly explained the basic attitude of the Chinese and Korean people towards this Korean armistice negotiation. In his speech, he put forward three fair and reasonable proposals, one of which pointed out that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a fundamental condition for ensuring the armistice of the Korean War and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Thereafter, at the eighth meeting on July 21st, our representative insisted on including this issue on the agenda of the armistice negotiation conference to discuss and resolve this issue. However, the US representative repeatedly refused to include this issue on the agenda. The US representative believed that the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea was a so-called "political issue" and refused to discuss it. Obviously, they wanted to separate the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea from achieving a ceasefire and armistice in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.
    Due to the US side's repeated refusal to include this issue on the agenda, our representative proposed a three-day recess at the meeting on the 21st to allow both sides to carefully consider this issue. After the resumption of the meeting on July 25th, in order to reach an armistice agreement as soon as possible to satisfy the preliminary wishes of peace-loving people all over the world and the desire for a ceasefire of foreign soldiers participating in the war, our representative agreed to the US side's proposal to leave the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea to another meeting after the ceasefire and armistice, and not to include it in the agenda of this meeting. At the same time, it proposed adding a fifth item, "Suggestions to the governments of both sides concerned," in addition to the four agenda items that had already been agreed upon, in order to discuss suggesting to the relevant governments of both sides to convene a higher-level representative meeting within a certain period after the implementation of the armistice agreement to negotiate the phased withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. Our new proposal quickly reached an agreement at the tenth meeting held at 1:00 PM on the 26th.
    Because our representative expressed a sincere desire for peace at the meeting, the armistice negotiation conference quickly entered the discussion of substantive issues. It is reported that at the meetings on the 26th and 27th to discuss the second item on the agenda, our representative has put forward the specific opinion of determining the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides to establish a demilitarized zone, as a basic condition for stopping hostilities in Korea. However, the US representative has so far refused to discuss taking the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line. Whether the Korean armistice negotiation conference can develop smoothly in the future depends on whether the US side has sufficient sincerity.

　　南日将军重申我方建议
　  三八线应为军事分界线
　  美方迄今拒绝讨论我方建议，今后朝鲜停战谈判会议是否可以顺利发展，要看美方是否有充分的诚意而定。
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】本社记者从朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第十三次会议，在七月二十九日上午十时（朝鲜时间）开始。下午三时零五分，由联合国军代表团建议休会。第十四次会议定于七月三十日上午十时举行。
    第十三次会议中，继续讨论确立双方军事分界线以建立非军事地区的问题。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席代表南日将军，在二十九日上午的会上再度说明：以三八线为双方军事分界线，双方各撤离三八线十公里，以建立非军事地区的我方具体建议，不但符合于朝鲜战场的军事实际，对双方都公平合理，亦同时有利于朝鲜问题的和平解决，而为此次停战谈判之基础。南日将军指出：任何夸耀海空军狂轰滥炸的效能，以取得片面有利作战地位的企图，都不是停战谈判中所应有的态度。
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜停战谈判会议经过了十次的会议讨论后，双方已就会议议程问题完成了协议，并在七月二十六日下午的会议上通过议程后，接着开始了议程第二项问题的讨论。
    这次停战谈判会议关于议程问题的讨论从七月十日开始到达成协议时为止，先后共十七天，实际会议的时间总共不过为二十一小时又四十分。讨论期间因为美方借口记者采访及划开城为中立区等枝节问题以及双方在若干议程问题上有分歧的意见，先后曾休会七天，只是在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面的代表，充分表示了对停战谈判的诚意，并在若干问题上一再作了让步以后，才使议程问题的讨论迅速地完成协议。
    人们知道：在停战谈判会议刚刚进行两天以后，乔埃和李奇微即借口新闻记者到开城采访和划开城为暂时的中立区两个枝节问题，而使会议停顿了三天之久。我方为了扫除在一些枝节问题上的误会和争论，使和平谈判得以顺利进行起见，表示在原则上同意将开城地区划为在会议期间的暂时的中立区，对于新闻记者采访问题也给了美方以便利，这样就解除了美方所提出的一切借口，使停战谈判会议在七月十五日重开。
    在议程问题上，从朝鲜境内撤出一切外国军队问题成为双方意见分歧的主要问题。在七月十日举行的第一次会议上，我方首席代表南日将军就扼要地说明了中朝人民对这次朝鲜停战谈判的基本态度。他在发言中提出了三项公平合理的建议，其中即指出：从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，是保障朝鲜战争的停战与朝鲜问题的和平解决的基本条件。在此以后，到七月二十一日的八次会议上，我方代表坚持主张将这个问题列入停战谈判会议议程，以讨论和解决这一个问题。但美方代表却一再拒绝将这个问题列入议程。美方代表认为从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队问题是所谓“政治问题”，而拒绝讨论。显然地，他们想把从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队这个问题和在朝鲜获得停火与停战和为和平解决朝鲜问题截然分开。
    由于美方一再拒绝将这一问题列入议程，我方代表在二十一日的会议上提议休会三天，以便双方对这一问题加以慎重的考虑。在七月二十五日复会后，我方代表为求早日达成停战协议，以满足全世界爱好和平人民的初步愿望和参战各外国士兵渴望停战的要求，同意美方对从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题留待停火休战后的另一次会议上去解决的主张，而不将其列入此次会议的议程之内；同时又提出在已获协议的四项议程之外，增加第五项“建议双方有关各国政府事项”，以便讨论向双方各国有关政府建议在停战协定实施后一定期间内召开双方高一级的代表会议，协商从朝鲜分期撤退一切外国军队的问题，我方的这个新建议，在二十六日下午一时举行的第十次会议即迅速获致协议。
    由于我方代表在会议中表示了真诚的和平愿望，使停战谈判会议迅速进入了实质问题的讨论。据悉：在二十六日、二十七日讨论议程第二项问题的会议上，我方代表已提出确定三八线为双方军事分界线，以建立非军事区，作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件的具体意见。但美方代表迄今仍拒绝讨论以三八线为双方军事分界线。今后朝鲜停战谈判会议是否可以顺利发展，要看美方是否有充分的诚意而定。
