The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China has arrived. I participate in the grand celebration with boundless joy and excitement. I would like to extend warm congratulations to the Communist Party of China.

The Communist Party of China has led the Chinese revolution through thirty years of arduous struggle, continuously leading the extremely broad worker movements, peasant movements, youth movements, and women's movements throughout the country, and has carried out armed struggles, advancing wave upon wave. In unprecedentedly difficult years, countless outstanding revolutionary comrades sacrificed themselves. The Party helped the Kuomintang reorganize, established a revolutionary united front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and carried out the Northern Expedition. It launched the August 1st Nanchang Uprising, implemented the land revolution, and waged war to overthrow the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang by force. It firmly held the border areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong, and resisted the years-long encirclement and suppression by Chiang Kai-shek in conjunction with imperialist forces. It undertook the 25,000-li Long March. It firmly held the Northwest and once again resisted the encirclement by Chiang Kai-shek's large armies. It presided over the release of Chiang Kai-shek, established the anti-Japanese national united front, led and persisted in the long-term War of Resistance Against Japan, and defeated Japanese imperialism. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it called for peace, democracy, and unity, and demanded the realization of peace to avoid civil war; but when Chiang Kai-shek was determined to sabotage peace, it went through the great People's Liberation War, and in just over three years, annihilated more than 8 million troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by U.S. imperialism, drove the forces of U.S. imperialism out of China, and finally won the complete liberation of the mainland of China, achieving the great victory of the people's revolution and founding the great People's Republic of China.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in less than two years, it has first completely wiped out the 1.3 million bandit troops left by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the mainland. Recently, it peacefully liberated Tibet, completed the complete unification of the entire mainland, and realized the great unity of the people of the whole country. This is an unprecedented initiative in China's thousands of years of history. Due to the victory of the people's revolution, imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have been basically defeated. The Chinese people have stood up since then. The Chinese nation is no longer a nation to be bullied. In particular, the Chinese People's Volunteers' aid to Korea and defeat of U.S. imperialism has shocked the world and made the world unanimously recognize, and even U.S. imperialism had to admit, that the People's Republic of China is a powerful country in the world and is forever invincible. China has leapt to become a powerful country in the world, which is the glorious result of the thirty years of heroic struggle of the Communist Party of China, advancing wave upon wave. Achievements in other aspects are too numerous to mention. Only a few major achievements are described. First, the banditry that has never been clarified in history has now been completely eradicated. The people of the whole country have gained a peaceful and prosperous life. Second, under the strong spirit of man overcoming natural disasters, the fairly widespread and serious drought in the country last spring and summer was overcome, and a nationwide bumper harvest was achieved last year. Third, prices, which have been unstable for more than ten years, have been basically stabilized since last spring. Financial unification was implemented, and the national financial situation was improved, first making the national fiscal revenue and expenditure close to balance, and thus industry and commerce also improved. All production has been rapidly restored and developed. In particular, the state economy has developed particularly rapidly, rapidly gaining and increasingly strengthening its leading position, making the planned nature of industrial production gradually strengthened, and paving the way for planned economic construction. Fourth, land reform is the main condition for improving the entire economic situation and carrying out large-scale industrial construction after the nationwide victory. Striving for the victorious completion of land reform is also an extremely arduous task. Apart from the old liberated areas where land reform has generally been completed, in the vast new liberated areas, land reform was launched in most areas last winter and has achieved significant results. It is expected that this winter and next spring, land reform across the country, except for a very small part with special circumstances, can be basically completed. Fifth, since the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries, a large number of special agents, bandits, and despots have been eliminated, and some wavering and backward elements have also been educated, thus the broad masses of honest people have been completely liberated; the long-oppressed working masses have raised their eyebrows and straightened their backs. In the great movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, all the darkness of the old Chinese society has been exposed and eliminated, which is really gratifying. This is an important link in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and an important measure to defend the achievements of the people's struggle. Sixth, in the past six months, in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, based on the popular and in-depth ideological education of love for the motherland, a patriotic production competition has been widely launched, which has greatly improved production and powerfully promoted the progress of various tasks. Seventh, in cities and villages, democratic government construction has been widely launched, gradually completing and consolidating the basic organization of the people's democratic united front. Eighth, due to the severe blows suffered by the feudal class, or its elimination, the entire society has rapidly changed in quality. All the dark aspects inherent in feudal society, such as corruption, deceit, hypocrisy, cruelty, debauchery, and boastfulness, have been transformed into the new society's practical, sincere, friendly, and vigorous bright aspects of serving the people. All these brilliant achievements are inseparable from the thirty-year struggle history of the Communist Party of China, inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and are the result of the thirty years of arduous, extraordinary, and heroic struggle of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China leading the Chinese people day after day. On the occasion of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China and the great revolutionary achievements of the past thirty years, we sincerely thank the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and we extend our highest respect to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

Since the uprising, after nearly two years of personal contact, I have realized from all the facts, especially from the rapid progress in the past two years, from the current glorious and vibrant situation, and even more from the thirty-year history of arduous struggle of the Communist Party of China, that I have thoroughly strengthened my understanding of the Communist Party of China, and I have completely strengthened my confidence in the Communist Party of China, especially thoroughly clarifying many of my past misconceptions. I am very excited and happy to closely follow the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. From then on, I also ended my decades of political isolation, and I feel infinitely warm. From then on, I realized and firmly believed:

The thirty-year struggle of the Communist Party of China has been very arduous, firm, and unwavering, which is very touching. The achievements of the thirty-year struggle are extremely brilliant, which is sincerely loved and respected.

The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is entirely due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, which is the glorious result of the thirty years of arduous struggle of the Communist Party of China.

Only the Communist Party of China, which has mastered Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, is capable of undertaking the task of leading the Chinese people's revolution and achieving today's brilliant achievements.

Only Mao Zedong Thought is the unity of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution, which is capable of creating New Democracy; only New Democracy is suitable for China's revolutionary practice today; only from New Democracy can we smoothly advance to socialism and communism. Mao Zedong Thought is the development of Marxism-Leninism, becoming the category of Chinese people's revolutionary practice, and also the category of revolutionary practice in all backward colonies in the East.

Only the Communist Party of China can lead the four major classes, establish and consolidate the united front and the joint regime; only under the leadership of the proletarian party—the Communist Party of China—can it both unite the people of the whole country and avoid being corrupted by the old society.

Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can it formulate and implement a perfect common program, unite the people of the whole country, consolidate the united front, guarantee the achievements of the people's revolution, and complete the construction of New Democracy.

Only the Communist Party of China, the proletarian party, can have such a high degree of class consciousness and such a strong fighting spirit, sufficient to completely overthrow the powerful reactionary rule of the trinity of deeply rooted imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Facts have proved that as long as the reactionary rule of the trinity of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is overthrown, the great power of the Chinese people will be united and developed. China has emerged with a vibrant new situation. China is already a powerful country in the world.

The Kuomintang's predecessor was a loose alliance from the bourgeoisie, petty-bourgeois radicals, bourgeois liberals, to the landlord class anti-Qing faction. After the 1911 Revolution was betrayed, many people in this alliance combined with reactionary groups that surrendered to imperialism, feudalism, and comprador forces, which limited the possibility of relying on the Kuomintang to completely overthrow feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, which limited the Kuomintang's ability to undertake the task of leading the Chinese revolution, and which limited that after the emergence of the Communist Party of China, as long as the Kuomintang opposed the Communist Party, it would inevitably become the object of the people's revolution.

Before the May Fourth Movement, the Kuomintang pursued the democratic revolution of old-style capitalism; at that time, advanced capitalist countries in Europe, America, and Japan had already entered the stage of imperialism, and after invading China, they had gradually combined with feudalism. This limited the possibility of the old-style capitalist democratic revolution being realized.

The success of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union influenced and encouraged Mr. Sun Yat-sen. With the help of the CPC, the Kuomintang was once reorganized, and the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, as well as the reorganization declaration, were very correct. However, the Kuomintang at that time did not fully accept the Soviet revolutionary theory and experience, especially after the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Kuomintang became a reactionary group led by Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the situation of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was limited to overthrowing the Northern Warlords. Later, when it really touched on anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, the reactionary Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, and then became the object of the people's revolution.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the reactionary Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek participated in the anti-Japanese front, but never gave up its reactionary dictatorial illusions. Therefore, it initially attempted to surrender from time to time, and later completely relied on U.S. imperialism, consistently acting as the "anti-communist" and oppressing people's running dog of imperialism.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek colluded with U.S. imperialism, using the conspiracy of peaceful negotiation as a respite, attempting to eliminate the CPC by force and achieve unification by force. However, the Communist Party of China fully adapted to the wishes of the people of the whole country, sincerely strived for peace, grasped the truth, defeated deceit, and led the people to overthrow the dictator.

The Communist Party of China has struggled arduously for thirty years, sacrificed countless outstanding revolutionary comrades, trained a powerful People's Liberation Army, cultivated a large number of strong cadres, and accumulated invaluable revolutionary experience; due to these favorable conditions, in the shortest time, it eliminated more than 8 million troops of Chiang Kai-shek; defeated the U.S. military invading Korea; quickly stabilized the country, making all construction advance rapidly, and achieved such a glorious situation, making China leap to become a powerful country in the world.

The Communist Party of China has mastered the scientific laws of historical development, leading the people of the whole country to advance in an orderly manner, from building New Democracy to steadily advancing to socialism, and then to communism. Because it has adhered to the laws of historical development, it has ended the historical cycle of rise and fall, governance and chaos, division and unity, and blind action. From then on, China's internal strife has been permanently eliminated. Although U.S. imperialism's aggression is still threatening us, the Chinese people who have stood up have full confidence and strength to defeat any threat of aggression. From then on, China is an independent and free country, and will become increasingly prosperous and happy.

Due to the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in leading the people's revolution, the strength of the peaceful and democratic camp has been greatly increased, and the strength of the world's aggressive camp has been greatly weakened. The war-mongers headed by U.S. imperialism are becoming increasingly isolated. The achievements of the Chinese Communist Party's thirty years of struggle have played a significant role in safeguarding world peace and preventing world war.

As the whole country is jubilantly celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we must unite under the banner of the Communist Party of China, unite under the banner of Mao Zedong, and strive to build a new China.

Study the glorious struggle history of the Communist Party of China, study the spirit of arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice of the members of the Communist Party of China, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve our political understanding, and achieve the realistic, prudent, humble, modest, and honest work attitude and style of work instructed by Chairman Mao, carry forward our spirit of loving the motherland and resolutely struggling for the motherland, resolutely support the just war against aggression of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and respond to the three major calls of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea on "June 1st"—to make patriotic pledges, to launch a movement to increase production and donations, and to strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. We unanimously use practical actions to strive for the early and complete defeat of the U.S. aggressors, and we unanimously use practical actions to safeguard lasting world peace.

Persist in completing land reform, completely eliminate the feudal class, and vigorously suppress counter-revolutionaries to defend the fruits of revolutionary victory and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!

　　庆祝中国共产党建党卅周年纪念
    ——全国人民一致团结在中国共产党旗帜之下，为建设新民主主义而奋斗
    程潜
    中国共产党成立三十周年了。我以无比的欢愉、无比的兴奋，参加庆祝盛典。我谨向中国共产党致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国共产党领导中国革命，经过了三十年的艰苦奋斗，曾经继续不断领导全国极其广泛的工人运动、农民运动、青年运动、妇女运动，曾经前仆后继地进行武装斗争。在史无前例的艰难岁月中，牺牲了无数的优秀革命同志。曾经帮助国民党改组，建立国共革命统一战线，进行北伐。曾经在南昌举行八一起义，实行土地革命，进行武装推翻国民党反动政权的战争。曾经坚据湘、赣、闽、粤边区，长期抵抗蒋介石结合帝国主义力量的积年围攻。曾经二万五千里长征。曾经坚据西北，再度抵抗蒋介石大军围困。曾经主持释放蒋介石，建立抗日民族统一战线，领导并坚持长期抗日战争，打倒了日本帝国主义。曾经在抗日战争胜利后，号召和平、民主、团结，要求实现和平，避免内战；但在蒋介石决心破坏和平的情况下，又经过伟大的人民解放战争，仅在三年多的时间内，消灭了美帝国主义所扶植的蒋介石匪帮八百多万军队，把美帝国主义的势力赶出中国，最后获得了全国大陆的彻底解放，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，创立了伟大的中华人民共和国。
    自从中华人民共和国成立到现在，还不到两年的时间，首先把蒋介石匪帮残留在大陆的一百三十万土匪武装彻底肃清了。最近又和平解放了西藏，完成了整个大陆的彻底统一，实现了全国人民的大团结。这在中国几千年历史上，还是史无前例的创举。由于人民革命的胜利，把帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义基本打垮了。中国人民从此站起来了。中华民族再也不是一个被欺侮的民族了。尤其是中国人民志愿军援朝，打败了美帝国主义，这更震动了全世界，使全世界一致承认甚至美帝国主义也不得不承认中华人民共和国是世界强大的国家，是永远不可战胜的。中国一跃而为世界强大国家，这是中国共产党三十年来前仆后继英勇奋斗的光辉成果。其他方面的成就，更不胜枚举。仅抽述几项主要的成就。第一，历史从未澄清的匪患，现在彻底肃清了。全国人民获得了安居乐业。第二，在人力战胜天灾的坚强斗争精神之下，把去年春夏全国相当普遍而严重的灾荒克服了，而且取得了去年全国普遍的丰收。第三，十余年来一直无法安定的物价，自去年春季基本稳定了。实行了财政统一，争取了全国财经的好转，首先使国家财政收支接近平衡，从而工商业也随之好转。一切生产都获得迅速的恢复与发展。尤其是国家经济发展得特别快，迅速地获得了而且日益增强了领导地位，使工业生产的计划性逐渐加强，为计划经济建设铺平了道路。第四，土地改革是在全国胜利之后，改善全部经济状况，进行大规模工业建设的主要条件。争取土地改革的胜利完成，也是一项极其艰巨的任务。除开老解放区一般都已先后完成土地改革而外，在广大的新解放区，大部分去冬都已展开土地改革，已获得重大的成绩。预计今冬明春，全国的土地改革除开有特殊情况的极小部分而外，均可基本完成。第五，自从大张旗鼓镇压反革命，肃清了大批特务、土匪、恶霸，也教育了一些摇摆不定的落后分子，由此广大的老实人民彻底获得了解放；长期受压迫的劳苦群众，扬眉吐气，伸得起腰。在镇压反革命伟大运动当中，把中国旧社会一切黑暗都揭开了，而且铲除了，真是大快人心。这是巩固人民民主专政的重要环节，也是保卫人民斗争成果的紧要措施。第六，半年来，在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动当中，在热爱祖国的思想教育普遍深入人心的基础上，广泛展开爱国主义的生产竞赛，大大地提高了生产，并有力地推动了各项工作的前进。第七，在城市和乡村中，普遍展开了民主建政，逐渐完成了并且巩固了人民民主统一战线的基本组织。第八，由于封建阶级遭受严重打击，或者被消灭，使整个社会随之迅速地变了质。凡属封建社会所蕴藏的贪污、诡诈、虚伪、残酷、骄淫、矜夸种种黑暗面，都转变为新社会为人民服务的朴实、诚笃、友爱、生气蓬勃光明面了。这一切辉煌的成就，都与中国共产党三十年的奋斗历史分不开，都与中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导分不开，都是毛主席和中国共产党领导中国人民三十年来如一日的艰苦卓绝英勇奋斗的开花结果。值此庆祝中国共产党三十周年纪念和三十年来伟大的革命成就之际，我们衷心感谢中国共产党和毛主席，我们谨向中国共产党和毛主席致以最崇高的敬礼。
    自从起义以后，我经过了将近二年的亲身接触，从一切事实中体察，尤其是从这二年来一切突飞猛进的进步中体察，从当前这么光辉灿烂生气勃勃的局面中体察，更从中国共产党三十年坚苦奋斗的历史中体察，就彻底加强了我对中国共产党的认识，就完全坚定了我对中国共产党的信心，尤其是彻底澄清了我过去不少的错误见解。我十分兴奋、十分愉快地紧随中国共产党，紧随毛主席。从此也结束了我数十年来在政治上的孤立，我感到无限的温暖。从此我认识到而且坚信了：
    中国共产党三十年的奋斗，是十分艰苦的，是坚定不渝的，令人十分感动的。三十年奋斗的成果，是极其辉煌的，令人竭诚敬爱的。
    中国人民革命的胜利，是完全由于中国共产党的正确领导，也就是中国共产党三十年坚苦奋斗的光荣成果。
    只有中国共产党掌握了马列主义和毛泽东思想，才足以担负起领导中国人民革命的任务，才可能获得了今日辉煌的成果。
    只有毛泽东思想是马列主义的理论与中国革命的实践之统一的思想，才可能创造新民主主义；只有新民主主义，才切合中国今天的革命实践；只有从新民主主义，才可能顺利地进到社会主义和共产主义。毛泽东思想是发展马列主义，成为中国人民革命实践的范畴，并且是东方一切落后的殖民地的革命实践范畴。
    只有中国共产党才可能领导四大阶级，建立并且巩固统一战线与联合政权；只有在无产阶级的政党——中国共产党领导之下，才既能团结全国人民，又不致遭受旧社会的腐蚀。
    只有在中国共产党的领导之下，才可能制订并且贯彻尽善尽美的共同纲领，团结全国人民，巩固统一战线；才可能保障人民革命的成果；才可能完成新民主主义的建设。
    只有中国共产党无产阶级的政党，才可能有这么高度的阶级觉悟，这么坚强的斗争精神，足以彻底打倒根深蒂固的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三位一体的势力雄厚的反动统治。事实证明，只要帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三位一体的反动统治被推翻，中国人民的伟大力量就团结起来，并且发扬起来了。中国就出现了生气蓬勃的崭新局面。中国就已经是世界强大的国家了。
    国民党前身就是从资产阶级、小资产阶级急进派，资产阶级自由派，到地主阶级反满派的松懈的联盟。在一九一一年革命被出卖以后，这个联盟中许多人与投降了帝国主义与封建及买办势力的反动集团相结合，这就限定了依靠国民党不可能彻底推翻封建主义和官僚资本主义，这就限定了国民党不可能担负领导中国革命的任务，这就限定了中国共产党出现以后，国民党只要反对共产党，就必然成为人民革命的对象。
    在五四以前，国民党追求旧式资本主义的民主革命；当时欧美和日本先进资本主义国家，已经进入了帝国主义阶段，并且侵入中国以后，又已与封建主义逐渐结合。这就限定了旧式资本主义的民主革命没有实现的可能了。
    苏联十月革命成功，影响了并且鼓励了孙中山先生。在中共帮助之下，国民党曾经一度改组，当时所标榜的联俄、联共、扶植农工三大政策以及改组宣言等等，就是十分正确的。但当时的国民党并未完全接受苏联革命理论和经验，尤其是中山先生去世以后，国民党更变为蒋介石所领导的反动集团了。所以国共合作的局面，就局限于推翻北洋军阀。后来真正触及反帝反封建，蒋介石所领导的反动国民党就背叛了革命，此后就成为人民革命的对象了。
    在中国共产党主导之下，蒋介石所领导的反动国民党虽然参加了抗日战线，但始终未放弃其反动独裁的幻想。因之初期就时时企图投降，后期就完全投靠了美帝国主义，一贯充当了帝国主义的“反共”和压迫人民的走狗。
    抗日胜利以后，蒋介石勾结美帝国主义，运用和平协商的阴谋诡计，作为缓兵之下，企图武力消灭中共，达成武力统一。但是中国共产党完全适应了全国人民的愿望，衷心争取和平，掌握真理，战胜了诡诈，领导人民，推翻了独夫。
    中国共产党三十年艰苦奋斗，牺牲了无数优秀的革命同志，也锻炼了强大无比的人民解放军，培养了大量的坚强干部，更累积了无上宝贵的革命经验；由于这些有利的条件，所以最短期间，就消灭了蒋介石八百多万军队；就打败了侵朝的美军；就迅速地安定了全国，使一切建设突飞猛进，获得了这么光辉灿烂的局面，使中国一跃而为世界的强大国家。
    中国共产党掌握了科学的历史的发展规律，领导全国人民循序前进，由建设新民主主义而稳步进到社会主义，再进到共产主义。因为坚持了历史的发展规律，就结束了历史上一兴一替、一治一乱、一分一合的循环盲动，从此中国的内乱永绝了，美帝国主义的侵略虽仍在威胁我们，但已经站起来的中国人民，完全有信心和力量击溃任何的侵略威胁。从此中国是独立自由的国家，而且将日趋繁荣，日趋康乐。
    由于中国共产党领导人民革命的胜利，大大地增加了和平民主阵线的力量，大大地削弱了世界侵略阵营的力量。当前以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们已日趋孤立了。中国共产党三十年奋斗的成果，对于保卫世界和平、制止世界大战是起了重大的作用。
    当举国欢腾热烈庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年之际，我们要一致团结在中国共产党旗帜之下，团结在毛泽东旗帜之下，为建设新中国而奋斗。
    学习中国共产党光荣的斗争历史，学习中国共产党员艰苦奋斗英勇牺牲的精神，学习马列主义与毛泽东思想，不断提高我们的政治认识，并且做到毛主席所指示我们的实事求是、谨慎谦虚、戒骄戒躁、老老实实的工作态度和工作作风，发扬我们热爱祖国、为祖国而坚决奋斗的精神，坚决支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军反侵略的正义战争，响应中国人民抗美援朝总会“六一”的三大号召——订立爱国公约，开展增产捐献运动，加强优抚烈军属工作，我们一致用实际行动，争取早日彻底打垮美国侵略者，我们一致用实际行动保卫世界持久和平。
    坚持完成土地改革，彻底消灭封建阶级，大张旗鼓镇压反革命以保卫革命胜利成果，以巩固人民民主专政。
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
