Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: Responsible individuals from various democratic parties and people's organizations in North Korea have issued statements expressing their unanimous intention to heighten vigilance and continue to strengthen their own forces.

　　Kim Dal-hyun, Chairman of the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party, and Kim Won-bong, Chairman of the People's Republican Party, pointed out in their talks that the American aggressors, having suffered heavy blows from the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, proposed holding armistice negotiations. However, whether the armistice can be realized depends on the sincerity of the United States. They called on the people to unite more closely and maintain a high degree of vigilance.

　　Hyun Heon, Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, called on the working class to continue to exert their strength and complete production tasks. Hyun Chil-jong, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Farmers' League, said that holding armistice negotiations is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Our farmers must continue to struggle to increase grain production.

　　Workers from factories and enterprises, office staff from organizations, and suburban farmers in the Pyongyang area expressed at discussion meetings that they would not relax because of the armistice negotiations. Worker Choi Gyu-chan said: Even if an armistice can be achieved, we still have the arduous tasks of preventing the aggressors from making a comeback and carrying out reconstruction. We must further launch a selfless production increase campaign. Farmer Jang Jeong-ok from Pyongyang North District said: Regardless of whether the armistice can be achieved or not, we must resolutely overcome difficulties, produce more grain, and strengthen our forces. Merchant Xie Dao-yi expressed at a discussion meeting of the Cangtianli People's Class that he would continue to strengthen support for the front lines and complete the plan to donate funds for weapons.
