Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: TASS reports that foreign affairs commentators for *Pravda* and *Izvestia* commented on the recently published U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan in London and Washington on the 22nd.

The *Pravda* commentator, Oliekhov, stated: The U.S. government has long violated the procedures stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement and is not prepared to draft a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The United States has decided not to allow all relevant countries to participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan.

The U.S. State Department has already prepared to send out "invitations" (actually, summonses), calling representatives of several countries to San Francisco and instructing them to sign the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan, a draft in whose preparation the Americans did not allow them to participate.

So far, it is not known which U.S. satellite countries will send representatives to San Francisco to sign that illegal U.S. document that solidifies the collusion between the U.S. government and Japanese revanchists. However, undoubtedly, the conspiracy of the U.S. warmongers has been resolutely condemned by all peace-loving countries.

*Izvestia*'s foreign affairs commentator, Folunsky, said: The United States is dragging many countries into the adventure of colluding separately with Japanese militarism. The publication of the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan has aroused a wide response in these countries. Many political leaders, parliamentarians, clergymen, and commentators have had to emphasize the danger of the U.S.-proposed separate peace treaty with Japan, and they have all expressed their disagreement with this treaty.

The Marshallized newspapers have always expressed their loyalty to the United States whenever they have the opportunity, but even these newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with Washington's brazen orders, although they expressed it very cautiously.

The countries of the Far East have expressed particularly strong protests against the U.S.-imposed draft peace treaty with Japan, because the people of these countries have suffered terribly from Japanese aggression, and they do not want this situation to happen again.

Even the Philippine government, which has always followed the United States' orders, has adopted a negative attitude towards the U.S.-drafted peace treaty under public pressure.

Representatives of the ruling groups of some U.S. vassal states are comforting themselves with the hope that they can soon propose some modifications to the draft peace treaty. However, Dulles' "explanation" completely shattered this hope. He said: He does not want major changes to the draft peace treaty, because "the points of principle are not subject to modification." The allies of the United States have thus been ordered to continue to serve as loyal slaves to the U.S. imperialists.

　　苏联报纸评论美制对日和约草案
　  远东各国人民抗议单独对日媾和

    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《真理报》与《消息报》外交评论员二十二日评论最近在伦敦与华盛顿发表的美国单独对日和约草案。
    《真理报》评论员奥列贺夫说：美国政府早就违反波茨坦协定所规定的程序，不准备草拟全面对日和约。美国决定不让一切有关国家参加草拟对日和约。
    美国国务院已经准备寄出“请柬”（实际上是召见通知书），叫若干国家的代表到旧金山去，并吩咐他们在美国的对日和约草案上签字，而这个和约草案在草拟时，美国人并没有准许它们参加。
    至今为止，还不知道那一个美国卫星国将派遣代表到旧金山，去签署那个把美国政府与日本报复主义者之间的勾当固定下来的非法的美国文件。然而，无疑的，美国战争贩子的阴谋已经受到一切爱好和平的国家的坚决斥责。
    《消息报》外交评论员佛隆斯基说：美国正在把许多国家拖入单独与日本军国主义勾结的冒险里。美国的对日和约草案的公布，在这些国家里激起了广泛的反响。许多政治领袖、议员、教士与评论家，都不得不着重指出美国所建议的单独对日和约草案的危险性，他们都表示不同意这个条约。
    马歇尔化的报纸一向是一有机会就向美国表示它们的忠顺，但甚至这些报纸也居然对华盛顿的厚颜无耻的命令表示不满，虽然它们表示得十分谨慎。
    远东各国对美国所强加的单独对日和约草案表示了特别猛烈的抗议，因为这些国家的人民备受日本侵略的惨痛蹂躏，他们不愿这种情形重演。
    甚至一贯唯美国之命是从的菲律宾政府，也在公众的压力下对美国制和约草案采取了否定的态度。
    某些美国附庸国家统治集团的代表们，用这样的希望来安慰他们自己，希望可以很快对和约草案提出某些修改。然而，杜勒斯的“解释”把这种希望完全粉碎了。他说：他不希望和约草案有重大的更改，因为“原则性的各点已不能修改”。美国的盟国就这样被命令继续给美帝国主义者充当忠顺的奴仆。
