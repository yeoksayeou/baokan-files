　　People's Court Trial Group of Gaoyou, Northern Jiangsu
    Goes Deep into Rural Areas for Circuit Trials of Counter-Revolutionaries
    In order to fully mobilize the masses and promptly suppress counter-revolutionaries, the People's Court of Gaoyou County, Northern Jiangsu, organized five trial groups in April to conduct circuit trials in rural areas, achieving considerable success. Based on our experience, circuit trials have the following advantages:
    (1) Under the watchful eyes of the masses, counter-revolutionary criminals cannot deny their crimes; cases can be handled more correctly. For example, Shen Lianhua, a murderer from Zhangxuan Township, stubbornly denied shooting Zhou Zigeng, a demobilized soldier, during the trial. Several people immediately presented the fact that the criminal had personally shot Zhou Zigeng with a revolver; the criminal had no choice but to confess truthfully.
    (2) Cases are handled quickly. In the county People's Court, trying a case often involves preliminary trials, retrials, and even third trials, as well as summoning the plaintiff for confrontation. A circuit trial can resolve several cases in one session. For example, the Zhangxuan Township trial group tried five cases in one afternoon and made preliminary judgments. Another example is Feng Zhenyu, a local tyrant from Zhongjian Township, who was detained for more than three months and could not be resolved despite multiple interrogations; on May 17th, he was taken to the township for a public trial in front of the masses, and the case was settled in two hours.
    (3) Trials can educate the masses, arouse their class hatred, and raise their political awareness. For example, in Fotan, Zhongxin, Yongfeng, and other townships, the masses realized after listening to the trials that counter-revolutionary elements colluded with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. More than two thousand farmers on the spot unanimously signed in support of the Five Great Powers concluding a peace pact and raised their hands against the United States arming Japan.
    (4) It does not hinder farmers' production. Handling a case in the county People's Court, if the plaintiff and defendant are required to confront each other, often delays the production of a dozen or even dozens of people. Circuit trials can avoid this situation. For example, when the Mapeng group tried the local tyrant Zhang Hengxi in Yongfeng Township on May 21st, the trial was conducted under the moonlight, without delaying farmers' production.

### 苏北高邮人民法庭审判小组  深入农村巡回审判反革命

　　苏北高邮人民法庭审判小组
    深入农村巡回审判反革命
    苏北高邮县人民法庭为了充分发动群众、及时镇压反革命，从四月份开始组织了五个审判小组，深入农村进行巡回审判，得到不少成绩。根据我们的体会，巡回审判有这样几点好处：
    （一）在群众众目所视之下，反革命罪犯对他的罪行无法狡辩；案件处理能更正确。如张轩乡杀人犯沈连华，在审判时坚不承认用枪打死我复员军人周自梗。有几个群众立即提出该犯亲手用左轮枪打死周自梗的事实；该犯就只得照实供认。
    （二）处理案件迅速。在县人民法庭里审判一个案件，往往经过初审、复审甚至三审，还要传讯原告对质。巡回审判开一个庭，就能解决好几个案件。如张轩乡审判小组一个下午就审判了五个案件，作出了初步的宣判。又如中坚乡恶霸冯珍玉，押了三个多月，审讯多次无法解决；五月十七号带到该乡在群众面前公审，二小时就定了案。
    （三）通过审判可以教育群众，启发群众的阶级仇恨，提高群众的政治觉悟。如在佛塔、中心、永丰等乡，群众在听审后，都认识到反革命分子是和美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮勾结的。当场两千多农民一致签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约和举手反对美国武装日本。
    （四）不妨碍农民生产。在县人民法庭处理一个案犯，如果要原被告对质，往往要耽误十几个人甚至几十个人的生产。巡回审判就能避免这种情况。如马棚小组五月二十一日在永丰乡审理恶霸张恒溪时，在月光下进行审判，并未耽误农民生产。
