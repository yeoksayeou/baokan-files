　　Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: After the US government announced its unilaterally drafted "Draft Treaty with Japan" on July 12th, it unilaterally sent invitations to fifty countries on the 20th in the so-called "position of host," inviting them to participate in the so-called "Peace Conference with Japan," which the US arbitrarily decided to hold in San Francisco on September 4th.
　　This unilateral action of the United States in issuing "invitations" completely betrays the Potsdam Agreement's procedure for preparing a peace treaty with Japan by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers and once again exposes a major conspiracy of the US government, namely, its insistence on excluding the People's Republic of China from the sacred right to participate in the drafting and signing of a peace treaty with Japan. In the list of countries that the United States has drawn up as "having fought against Japan," China, which has resisted Japan for the longest time and made the greatest sacrifices, is actually excluded.
　　The US government's "invitation" declares that the US intends to distribute the "final text" of the US-made Treaty of Peace with Japan on August 13th. The "peace conference" scheduled to be held in San Francisco will "conclude and sign a treaty with Japan based on the terms of this single "original treaty." Dulles, the drafter of the US draft peace treaty with Japan, has stated that the US draft will not be subject to "fundamental" revisions; the Associated Press has also revealed that this "peace conference" is "purely a formality." It is clear from this that the purpose of this "Peace Conference with Japan," which the United States has illegally convened with the consent of its British and French servants, is to coerce the countries participating in the "Peace Conference" to sign and stamp the "Treaty of Peace with Japan" drafted by the United States, in order to "legalize" the illegal measures of the United States.

### 违背波茨坦协定公然侵犯我国权利  美公布片面制订的《对日和约草案》后  又擅自“邀请”五十国参加“对日和会”

　　违背波茨坦协定公然侵犯我国权利
　  美公布片面制订的《对日和约草案》后
　  又擅自“邀请”五十国参加“对日和会”
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国政府在七月十二日公布它片面制订的《对日和约草案》之后，又在二十日以所谓“主人的地位”，片面地向五十个国家发出请柬，邀请它们参加美国擅自决定九月四日在旧金山举行的所谓“对日和会”。
    美国这次片面发出“请柬”的行动，完全背叛了波茨坦协定关于由四国外长会议准备对日和约的程序，并再次暴露了美国政府的一个大阴谋，即它坚持要排斥中华人民共和国参加拟制与签订对日和约的神圣权利。在美国所开列的“曾对日本作战”的国家的名单中，抗日最久、牺牲最大的中国居然竟被除外。
    美国政府的“请柬”声明：美国拟于八月十三日散发美制对日和约的“最后的原文”。预定在旧金山举行的“和会”，即将根据这一单独“和约的原文的条款，和日本缔结并签订和约”。美国对日和约草案的起草人杜勒斯已经表示：美国的草案将不作“原则上”的修改；美联社也曾经透露，这次“和会”“完全是一种仪式”。由此可见，美国这次在其英、法仆从同意下所非法召开的“对日和会”，其目的在于胁迫参加“和会”的国家在美国制订的“对日和约”上签字画押，使美国的非法措施“合法化”。
