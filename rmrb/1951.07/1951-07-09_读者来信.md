    The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Construction of a Workers' Hospital Building:
    Blind Construction Leads to Serious Losses

    To the Editor:

    In the construction of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's workers' hospital office building, construction was started blindly without careful design, resulting in significant setbacks in the project. This has caused the state to pay a considerable amount of funds without receiving the due value and delaying the building's use.

    This project is relatively large, with many internal heating and electrical equipment. Construction began in 1950, and although the civil engineering is nearing completion, the heating design plan is still not available, making it impossible to coordinate with the civil construction. Although local construction supervisors have repeatedly raised this issue, the Iron and Steel Plant has not taken timely remedial measures. During the installation of the electrical lighting, the newly constructed and completed floor slabs and walls had to be chiseled with many grooves and holes, and then re-patched and plastered, leaving a new building with numerous traces of repair, which has a great impact on the structural strength and aesthetics of the project. Until now, the heating project has not been installed or designed, and there are already difficulties in installation. Comrades Wang Dasheng of the plant's construction office and Wang Rongwan of the construction department are only allowing holes to be left in the terrazzo flooring for the heating pipes (which is not entirely feasible), and then repairing them later. This will repeat the process of chiseling grooves, which will not only waste labor and materials but also reduce the structural strength of the project. On June 23rd, Engineer Lu of the construction department notified the terrazzo flooring project to be temporarily suspended. The losses caused by the lack of proper design for heating and other projects alone are considerable.

    In addition, the original design for the non-toxic operating room included two viewing platforms. After completion, it was discovered that the room was not large enough, and the viewing platforms were removed. At the same time, it was discovered that the room must be washed with disinfectant on the ceiling, requiring a waterproof approach; however, it is now felt that it is difficult to change. Another example is the canopy of the basement, which is six meters long and protrudes two meters from the wall. The original design had no pillars. After it was built last year, it became unstable this year, and pillars and windows were added. In particular, the construction guidance was inconsistent. After the fair-faced brick wall project was built according to the instructions and technical habits, the Iron and Steel Plant's construction department and construction office proposed changing the approach, based on the fair-faced brick wall standard of the Iron and Steel Plant's dormitory for single employees, by painting one end of the brick black. This approach is no longer very suitable. As a result, when it was completed to three-quarters, Engineer Lu of the construction department proposed rework, washing off the black spots on the bricks, then brushing slurry and pointing the joints. There are also cases where the design did not meet the needs of the hospital, and parts of the project will have to be modified and added.

    Such cases have caused very serious adverse consequences, wasting national construction funds and resulting in many irreparable defects and failures in a building that could have achieved better quality standards. This lesson is worth noting in future construction.

    I Feel Incredibly Honored and Happy After Joining the Military Cadre School

    To the Editor:

    The State Administration Council of the Central People's Government has once again issued a solemn call to recruit young students to participate in the motherland's national defense construction. This call will surely be enthusiastically responded to by young people across the country. Recalling when we signed up to join the military cadre school last year, many students were not approved due to quota limitations and other conditions, but they were all determined to strive to participate in the cause of national defense construction. Today, the day they have long awaited has finally arrived.

    I was originally a student at Nanchang Normal School in Jiangxi. Last year, I gloriously joined the military cadre school. After entering the school, the intense and joyful revolutionary life has made my body stronger and my temperament more lively. We gradually get rid of the bad ideological habits of the old society and become young people with revolutionary ideas and firm will. What particularly moved us was that the leaders took care of and loved us like parents; the veteran comrades cared for us like brothers and sisters. I remember that within a week of our arrival at the school, we received hundreds of cordial letters of sympathy from the veteran students. Living in the revolutionary family, we felt incredibly warm and happy.

    In our three and a half months of political and military study, we realized that only by dispelling all personal plans and combining our personal future with the revolution can we have a bright future. Based on this ideological foundation, we happily obeyed the organization's arrangements and gloriously embarked on our work posts.

    Young students, come on! The millions of people of the motherland are cheering for you: "Forward! Forward to victory!" For the safety of the motherland and the happiness of the people, and to defend world peace, we young people should dedicate all our strength to consolidate and strengthen the great motherland's national defense cause.

    Wu Jindong, Heir to Wu Xun, Engages in "Education" Activities; Cadres in Liaocheng Prefecture Should Not Blindly Support Him

    To the Editor:

    In his self-criticism related to the criticism of Wu Xun, Vice Premier Guo Moruo quoted the inscription he wrote for the Biography of Wu Xun. The last part of that inscription said: "It is acceptable to cherish it as a miracle, but such a miracle will not appear again in a new democratic society." In fact, this is not entirely true. Not only does the shameful "Wu Xun spirit" still circulate to this day, but there is also a real person who is inheriting his mantle. This person is called Wu Jindong. His actions, one or two decades ago, continued to win the respect of the old education circles (before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he donated money to establish a Wu Xun primary school in Dawang Temple, Nanguan, Heze. The method of donating money was also by kowtowing and calling people grandpa). Even half a year ago, he was supported and praised by many administrative cadres and education cadres (I myself am one of them; I am an education worker in Pingyuan Province).

    We all know that Wu Xun, on the surface, never married for life. But he had adopted descendants, and this is Wu Jindong. It is said that he is his great-grandson. Wu Jindong is now about sixty years old. Last autumn, in order to inherit Wu Xun's "cause," he set out from his hometown in Liaocheng Prefecture to continue his education activities. Before departure, he specially asked the local government to write letters of introduction, some from the commissioner, some from the county magistrate; some written to the provincial chairman, some written to the political and educational organs along the way. In addition, he also made two large notebooks for responsible persons from various places to write inscriptions and sign. I don't remember what day it was, but he passed through Yanggu and Fanxian, crossed the Yellow River south, and arrived in Heze. One morning, the Culture and Education Section of the Heze Prefectural Commissioner's Office wrote a letter of introduction to our school. At that time, we received him very solemnly. After he explained his intentions, he took out all the inscription notebooks, various certificates, and letters of introduction for us to see. He repeatedly explained who personally wrote the words, and whose the inscription by a certain leader. He also said that he would visit Chairman Chao Zhefu of the Provincial People's Government in Xinxiang in a few days, and that he wanted to go to Beijing. I don't remember the contents of those letters of introduction, but the two thick notebooks, filled with praise from commissioners, county magistrates, heads of culture and education sections, and school principals, left a deep impression on me, such as "Serving the people," "Selflessness for the group," "Following in the footsteps of the ancestors," "Inheriting the legacy of the predecessors, developing education," "Carrying forward the spirit of Mr. Wu Xun, serving the new democratic education cause!" and so on, had already filled half of the notebook. Finally, in addition to treating him to a meal, we also wrote words of commendation without exception.

    From this incident, we can see that the "Wu Xun spirit" still circulates to this day, not only affecting many people in Pingyuan Province, but also many cadres (many of whom are Communist Party members) who blindly worship Wu Xun and therefore praise Wu Jindong, thinking that he will develop the new democratic education cause! Therefore, I put forward four suggestions: (1) The Propaganda and Education organs at the provincial level in Pingyuan should immediately formulate a plan to specifically and deeply criticize the Wu Xun spirit, in order to eliminate the latent slavish and backward thinking in people's minds, and correctly understand what is the excellent tradition of the nation and the correct revolutionary path of the working people. The time for this discussion and criticism in Pingyuan Province can be longer than that stipulated by the Ministry of Education. (2) The Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Tangyi County government should educate Wu Xun's descendants to stop their "fundraising for education" activities, patiently work through their thinking, and make them switch to production. And their materials should be collected in detail and reported critically. (It is estimated that Wu Jindong's father, grandfather, and even his children and grandchildren, will have or want to do this kind of activity.) (3) All those who wrote inscriptions for Wu Jindong should conduct ideological self-examination. (4) The teachers and students of Wu Xun Normal School (in Liulin, Tangyi) should thoroughly get rid of the influence of the "Wu Xun spirit" through study.

      With respect!

      Li Ziqian, Heze Middle School, Pingyuan Province

    太原钢铁厂修建工人医院大楼
    盲目施工损失严重编辑同志：
    太原钢铁厂在修建工人医院办公大楼工程中，没有周密设计即行盲目施工，致工程遭受重大挫折，使国家付出相当数额的资金而得不到应有的代价，且延误了建筑物的使用时间。
    这项工程规模是较大的，内部的暖气、电气设备很多，自一九五○年就已动工，直到现在，土木工程已近结束，暖气的设计图案却还没有，无法配合土木建筑工程进行。这一问题虽经当地施工负责人屡次提出，但钢铁厂也未作及时补救的措施。在装设电灯工程时，只好把新修完整的楼板墙壁凿成许多沟道洞眼，然后再重新泥补粉刷，使一个新的建筑却补修得痕迹累累，对工程坚固和美观上都有很大影响。直到现在暖气工程没有按装、没有设计，已经感到有装不上的困难。该厂施工事务所汪达声同志、建筑部王荣万同志只是让在做磨石地时留出装暖气管子的空洞（这不是完全可能的），以后再修补，这将重演一番剔沟凿道，不只浪费工料，且会削减了工程的坚固程度。在六月二十三日，建筑部陆工程师已通知磨石地工程暂时停工。单只暖气等工程没有妥善设计所造成的损失，就是相当大的。
    此外，无毒手术室原设计有参观台两个；在已经完成后才发现房间不够大，又将参观台拆除。同时发现该室必须用消毒水洗棚顶，要改用耐水的做法；但现已感到无法改变的困难。又如地下室雨棚长六公尺，突出墙宽二公尺，原设计并无支柱，去年修好今年发生了不牢现象，而又增加了支柱和窗子。尤其是施工指导上互不一致，清水墙工程依据说明书及技术上的习惯做成一部后，钢铁厂建筑部及施工事务所提出改变做法，根据钢铁厂单身宿舍清水墙为标准，把砖一端刷黑，这种做法在现在已不很适合，结果作到了四分之三的程度的时候，建筑部陆工程师才提出返工，洗去砖上的黑点、再刷浆、抅灰缝。其他还有由于设计时没根据院部的需要，工程上又将有部分重新修改增添。
    诸如此类事例造成恶果很为严重，既浪费了国家建设资金，又使本可以做到质量标准较好的建筑，而结果造成许多无法弥补的缺陷，以至失败。这一教训是值得在今后建设中引起注意的。

    我参加军事干部学校后感到无比的光荣和愉快编辑同志：
    中央人民政府政务院又一次发出了招收青年学生参加祖国国防建设的庄严号召。这个号召必将得到全国青年的热烈响应。回想我们去年报名参加军事干部学校的时候，有许多同学因受名额和其他条件的限制，没有被批准，但他们都有决心争取要参加祖国国防建设事业。今天，他们久已盼望的日子终于来到了。
    我原是江西南昌师范学校的学生。在去年光荣参加了军事干部学校。入校以后，紧张愉快的革命生活，使我的身体变得更强壮，性情更活泼了。我们逐渐摆脱旧社会的不良思想习气，成为一个富有革命思想和抱有坚定意志的青年。特别使我们感动的，是首长们像父母一样照顾和爱护着我们；老同志们像兄弟姐妹般关心着我们。记得我们刚到校的一个星期内，就接到了老同学们给我们几百封的亲切慰问信。我们生活在革命大家庭里，感到无比的温暖和愉快。
    我们在三个半月的政治、军事学习中，体会到：只有打消个人的一切打算，把个人的前途和革命结合起来，才会有我们的光明前途。在这样的思想基础上，我们愉快地服从了组织分配，光荣地走上了工作岗位。
    青年同学们，来吧！祖国千千万万的人民在向你们欢呼：“前进！向胜利前进！”为了祖国的安全和人民的幸福，为了捍卫世界和平，我们青年应该献出一切力量来巩固和加强伟大祖国的国防事业。

    武训继承人武金栋的“兴学”活动聊城专区干部不应盲目支持编辑同志：
    郭沫若副总理在联系着武训批判的自我检讨一文中，引了他为武训传写的题词，那段题词最后曾说：“作为奇迹珍视是可以的，新民主主义的社会里面，不会再有这样的奇迹出现了。”其实并不尽然，不仅可耻的“武训精神”仍流传至今，且还实有其人在继承他的衣钵。这个人叫武金栋。他的行为，一、二十年前，曾继续博得旧教育界的崇敬（抗战前他就在菏泽南关大王庙，捐钱成立了一所武训小学。捐钱的方法，也是叩头喊爷爷）。就是半年以前，还被我们许多行政干部、教育干部所支持与称赞着。我自己也是其中的一个（我是平原省的一个教育工作者）。
    我们都知道，武训在表面上是终身不曾娶妻的。但他却有过继的后代，这就是武金栋。据说这是他的曾孙。武金栋现在约有六十岁上下。去年秋后，他为了承袭武训“事业”，从他的故乡聊城专区出发，继续兴学活动。出发前，特请当地政府写了介绍信，有专员的，有县长的；有写给省主席的，有写给沿途政教机关的。另外他还制就了两个大本子，以备各地负责人题词签字。不记得什么日子了，他经过阳谷、范县，渡河南下，又到了菏泽。一天上午，菏泽专署文教科写信介绍到我们学校来。当时，我们很郑重地接见了他。他说明来意后，就把题词本子、各种证明、介绍信件，统统拿出来让我们看。一再说明这是谁亲笔写的字，那是某某首长题的词。并说他不日就往新乡拜见省人民政府晁哲甫主席，还说想到北京去。那些介绍信的内容我记不清楚了，但两个厚厚的本子，题满了专员、县长、文教科长、学校校长的赞词，给我留下深刻的印象，如“为人民服务”，“舍己为群”，“绳其祖武”，“继承先人遗志，发展教育事业”，“发扬武训先生的精神，为新民主主义教育事业服务！”等等，已写了半本子。最后，我们除了招待他吃饭，也无例外地题了嘉勉的词句。
    从这件事情来看，“武训精神”流传至今，不仅影响平原省许多群众，也还有许多干部（其中有不少是共产党员），因盲目崇拜武训，因而也称赞着武金栋，以为他会发展新民主主义教育事业！因此，我提出四点建议：（一）平原省级宣教机关，应马上定出计划，具体的深入的批判武训精神，以扫除人们潜存的奴化、落后思想，正确了解什么才是民族的优良传统和劳动人民正确的革命道路。这个讨论与批判的时间在平原省可较教育部指示所规定的更长一些。（二）聊城专署和堂邑县政府应教育武训后代停止“募款兴学”活动，耐心打通其思想，使其转入生产。并将他们的材料，详细搜集，批判地报道出来。（估计武金栋的父、祖以至他的儿孙，也会有或想做这种活动。）（三）凡为武金栋题词的人，应作思想检查。（四）武训师范（在堂邑柳林）的师生，经过学习，应彻底摆脱“武训精神”的影响。
      此致敬礼！
