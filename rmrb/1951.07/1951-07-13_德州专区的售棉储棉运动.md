　　The Cotton Selling and Storage Campaign in Dezhou Prefecture
    Wu Kecheng
    Dezhou Prefecture is one of the major cotton-producing areas in Shandong. On June 3rd, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the CCP Prefectural Committee issued urgent instructions and arrangements for the cotton selling and storage work. They then organized working groups, focusing on Wuqiao, Caohe, Dongguang, Linyi, and Lingxian to create experiences to promote the overall effort. Currently, the cotton storage and selling work has gradually transitioned from key pilot projects to a comprehensive rollout. Pilot tests have demonstrated that farmers possess a significant amount of stored cotton. According to the cotton storage statistics from Guo Ren Village, Yinxiang District, Caohe on the 16th: 3 households in the village stored 1,500 jin of seed cotton, 6 households stored 1,000 jin; 12 households stored 500 jin; 21 households stored 300 jin; 100 households stored 80 jin; 14 households stored over 50 jin, totaling 156 households, accounting for 8% of the total households in the village, with a total storage of 31,500 jin of seed cotton. Furthermore, it was discovered that even in non-cotton producing areas, the masses also have considerable cotton storage. For example, after a meeting of Party members and Youth League members in Mawangdian, Ningjin, the village's 200 households stored a total of 11,000 jin of cotton.

    The area has achieved the following results in purchasing and storing cotton: In early June, the entire area collected over 690,000 jin of seed cotton; in mid-June, it collected over 968,000 jin; and from June 21st to June 25th, it collected 968,000 jin in just five days. In total, over 2.6 million jin of seed cotton were collected in 25 days, and the purchase figures are increasing daily.

  Experience and Lessons
    The experience in the area proves that in-depth patriotic education, clearing the thinking of village cadres, and leveraging the core leadership role of the Party are the fundamental keys to the smooth progress of the cotton selling and storage work. Conversely, coercion, commandism, and simplistic approaches will lead to setbacks. For example, in Yuji, by denouncing the crimes of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the significance of selling and storing cotton was explained to raise the awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, the specific methods of selling and storing cotton were vigorously promoted to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses. As a result of this approach, the cooperative collected 24,000 jin of cotton in six days. However, the results of coercive orders were very poor. For example, a cooperative cadre in a certain area said at a mass meeting: "This cotton selling and storage is very important. Those who have cotton but do not store or sell it are little Chiang Kai-sheks and reactionary secret societies." After speaking, he immediately asked the masses to report their sales and storage figures. The masses' emotions were not high. Some said, "I don't have any. If you find out I have cotton, I will accept the punishment." Some said, "I still have eight jin."

  Problems to be Solved Urgently
    The following problems still exist in the cotton purchasing and storing work in this area that urgently need to be solved:

    1. There is a lack of in-depth patriotic propaganda and mobilization education. The government's policies and methods for selling and storing cotton are not clearly explained, and the policy is not explained through concrete examples to clear up thinking, so some cotton farmers still have many concerns, such as "fear of being called rich," "fear of offending people," "fear of lending," and "fear of changing their status." Individual cotton farmers have unclear understanding of the current situation and "fear that the cooperative will collapse." Therefore, they dare not sell during the day and go to the company to sell at night; they dare to sell in far-off places, but dare not sell to the cooperative; they report less and sell more; some dare not report their names after selling cotton, etc. Individual bad elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors, which has affected the development of the cotton selling and storage work.

    2. Insufficient Party education. Some village cadres and Party members have failed to play a leading role. For example, in Wuqiao County, a village branch secretary sold 260 jin of seed cotton after the first mobilization and enlightenment, and then sold another 700 jin after the second mobilization, but still actually stores over 3,000 jin of seed cotton. Some village cadres are reluctant to sell their own cotton and adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the cotton selling and storage work. When cooperative cadres go to the village to conduct propaganda, the village cadres say, "Sell all 300 jin of seed cotton in our entire village to the cooperative." But in reality, the village actually has 3,000 to 4,000 jin of cotton stored. The masses then act based on the actions of the cadres, Party members, and Youth League members.

    3. After selling their stored cotton, cotton farmers are unwilling to store large amounts of currency and are eager to purchase and store wheat or other necessary supplies. For example, on June 13th, over 10,000 jin of new wheat were put on the market in Yuji market, and were all sold out before noon, causing the price of wheat to rise from 1,050 yuan to 1,200 yuan that day. Therefore, some cotton farmers reflected: "No mobilization is needed. As long as the cooperative has wheat, we will take cotton."

  Shortcomings of Leadership
    The above problems are mainly due to the following shortcomings in leadership and arrangements:

    1. Some Party committees do not pay enough attention to this work and do not personally grasp and specifically check it. It is understood that, out of the 16 counties in the entire area, except for some counties whose Party committees sent leading cadres to be responsible for grasping and specifically helping to do a good job in the base point work, most of the other counties only made general arrangements and general leadership. Although Ningjin County had received several instructions from the Prefectural Committee, the relevant departments still did not pay enough attention to it, and were still worried about hindering "public-private relations," "freedom of trade," etc., thus relaxing market management and education for private merchants, resulting in some private merchants taking the opportunity to purchase cotton at high prices and disguising themselves as visiting relatives and friends to secretly compete for cotton. Because the County Party Committee did not resolutely make a feasible plan based on the spirit of the Prefectural Committee's instructions, the task flowed freely after it reached the district and township levels. District-level leaders lacked sufficient understanding of the cotton storage and selling work as an important and urgent task, so some complained that "now there are five gongs and drums beating at the same time (i.e., resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, production, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, summer grain tax, purchasing and storing cotton)," and did not know that these tasks should be combined to be done well.

    2. Too many meetings and too long arrangement time. For example, after the Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of county Party secretaries and county magistrates, each county also convened meetings of district chiefs, district Party committee secretaries, and township cadres, plus meetings of various business departments, with meetings almost every day. It is understood that the meetings of county, district, and township cadres did not end until June 22nd. But very little was done to extensively carry out propaganda and mobilization to cotton farmers and solve the ideological concerns of the masses.

  Improvement Methods
    In response to the above situation, the Party and government leading organs and relevant departments in the area have proposed the following methods: (1) Leading organs at the county and district levels should use capable cadres to grasp the situation, guide the work in a timely manner, and promote the comprehensive development of the movement. (2) Carry out in-depth political mobilization, hold good village Party member and Youth League member meetings and cotton farmer representative meetings, carry out patriotic education, and specifically explain policies and methods, so that cotton farmers can realize from specific policies that selling cotton to the country is a "beneficial to the country and beneficial to themselves" thing, and actively sell cotton to the country on the basis of being conscious and voluntary. (3) Clear the thinking of village cadres and give play to the leading role of Party branches. Break through various concerns among cadres and the masses, and specifically solve the practical problem that cotton farmers are unwilling to store currency after selling cotton: vigorously promote the benefits of fixed-amount savings with guaranteed principal and value maintenance; vigorously supply cotton farmers with the wheat, flour and other living and production materials they need, and organize various specialized companies to vigorously cooperate in supplying cotton farmers.

### 德州专区的售棉储棉运动

　　德州专区的售棉储棉运动
    吴可成 
    德州专区是山东主要产棉区之一。六月三日专署和中共地委对售棉储棉工作作了紧急指示与布置，然后组织了工作组，以吴桥、曹河、东光、临邑、陵县等地为重点，创造经验，以推动全面。目前储棉售棉工作，已由重点试办逐渐进入全面开展的阶段。重点试验中证明农民手中的存棉是相当多的：据曹河殷巷区郭人村十六日的储棉统计：全村储存籽棉一五○○斤者三户，一○○○斤者六户；五○○斤者十二户；三○○斤者二十一户；八○斤者一○○户；五○斤以上者十四户，共一五六户，占全村总户数的百分之八，共计储存籽棉三一五○○斤。并且发现了，非产棉区群众亦有不少存棉，如寗津马王店开过党团员会议后，全村二百户，共储棉一万一千斤。
    现该区购储棉花已有如下成绩：六月上旬全区共收籽棉六十九万多斤，中旬共收九十六万八千斤，二十一日到二十五日五天即收九十六万八千斤，总计二十五天共收籽棉二百六十余万斤，收购数字正逐日增加。
  经验和教训
    该区经验证明：深入爱国主义教育，打通乡村干部思想，发挥党的核心领导作用，是售棉储棉工作顺利开展的基本关键；反之，强迫命令和简单从事，工作就要碰壁。如于集通过控诉美帝国主义蒋匪的罪恶，说明售棉储棉意义，提高群众觉悟及爱国热情；同时并大力宣传售棉储棉具体办法，打破群众思想顾虑。这样作的结果，合作社六天即收棉二万四千斤。但是强迫命令的结果，却很不好。如某地合作社干部在群众大会上讲：“这次售棉存棉很要紧，有棉花不存不卖是小蒋介石，是反动会道门。”说完了当场叫群众报告售储数字，群众情绪不高，有的说“我没有，如查出我有棉花甘受罚”；有的说“我还有八斤”。
  亟待解决的问题
    该专区在购棉储棉工作中目前还存在着如下问题亟待解决：
    一、缺乏深入的爱国主义宣传动员教育，对政府政策及售棉储棉办法讲解不清，未能通过具体实例讲解政策打通思想，因而仍有部分棉农存在很多顾虑，如有的棉农“怕说富”、“怕得罪人”、“怕人借”、“怕变成份”；个别的对时局认识不清，“怕合作社垮台”。因此白天不敢卖，黑夜去公司卖；敢去远地卖，不敢到合作社去卖；报的少，卖的多；有的卖了棉花不敢报名字等。个别地区坏分子乘机造谣，影响了售棉储棉工作的开展。
    二、党内教育不够，部分乡村干部党员未能起带头作用。如吴桥县有的乡支部书记在首次动员启发后，卖出籽棉二六○斤，经二次动员后，又卖出七○○斤，现在尚实存籽棉三千余斤。有的村干部因自己有棉不愿卖，对售储棉花工作采取应付态度，当合作社干部到村进行宣传时，村干部即说：“将我们全村三百斤籽棉全部卖给合作社。”但实际上该村实存的棉花尚有三、四千斤。群众则看着干部、党员、团员的行动行事。
    三、棉农将存棉卖出之后，不愿大量存放货币，急于购存小麦或其他必需的物资。如六月十三日，于集市场上市新麦一万多斤，午前即全部售光，致当日麦价由一○五○元涨至一二○○元。因此有的棉农反映：“不用动员，只要合作社有麦子，我们就拿棉花。”
  领导的缺点
    以上问题的产生，主要是由于领导与布置上有如下缺点：
    一、有些党委对此工作不够重视，未亲自掌握与具体检查。据了解：全区十六个县除部分县的党委派主要干部负责掌握、具体帮助搞好基点工作外，其他各县多系一般布置，一般领导。寗津县虽经地委几次指示，仍未引起有关部门足够重视，还顾虑什么有碍“公私关系”、“贸易自由”等等，因而放松了市场管理和对私商的教育，以致产生了部分私商乘机高价收购棉花及伪装看亲戚、找朋友，暗中争购棉花的现象。由于县委没有坚决地依据地委指示精神具体作出可行的计划，因此任务到区乡后便发生自流现象。区级领导上对储棉售棉工作为当前突击性的重要任务认识不足，因此有的埋怨“现在是五面锣鼓（即抗美援朝、生产、镇压反革命、夏征农业税、购棉储棉）一齐打”，不知道这些工作正是应该结合起来才能做好的。
    二、会议过多，布置时间太长。如地委召开县委书记、县长会议之后，各县又召开了区长区委书记乡干部会议，再加上各业务部门的会议，几乎每日有会。据了解各县区乡干部会议至六月二十二日才相继结束。但真正广泛地向棉农进行宣传动员，解决群众的思想顾虑则做得很差。
  改进的办法
    针对上述情况，该区党政领导机关及有关部门已提出以下办法：（一）县区各级领导机关，要以有力干部掌握情况及时指导工作，推动运动的全面开展。（二）深入进行政治动员，开好乡村党员团员大会及棉农代表会议，开展爱国主义教育，具体讲解政策、办法，使棉农从具体政策中认识到向国家售棉是“利国利己”的事情，使其在自觉自愿的基础上，积极地向国家售棉。（三）打通乡村干部思想，发挥党的支部的领导作用。打破干部群众中各种顾虑，具体解决棉农卖了棉花不愿存货币的实际问题：大力宣传定额储蓄保本保值办法的好处；大力供应棉农需要的小麦、面粉及其他生活生产需要的物资，组织各专业公司大力配合供应棉农。
