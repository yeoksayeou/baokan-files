The CCP Northwest Regional-Level Organization Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries and study leaders from various organs on the 4th of this month. Based on the Northwest Bureau's notice regarding the study of cadres on the job, Comrade Zhao Shouyi, a committee member, provided explanations and specific arrangements for the purpose and methods of studying Party history. The meeting stipulated that the time for studying Party history should be determined by each organ based on the development of the study. It is imperative that every comrade, after studying Party history, has a preliminary understanding of the Party's history, the Party's line, and the issue of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class. The meeting also focused on discussing the issue of instructors. To strengthen the political theory study of cadres, the meeting decided to establish a Party Committee Lecturer Group, with Comrade Xi Yi, the Party Committee Secretary, concurrently serving as the head, and Comrade Yang Yulin, the Deputy Party Committee Secretary, concurrently serving as the secretary, to preside over daily work. The lecture content, regional division, and lecturer assignments will be decided by the Lecturer Group meeting soon.

    中共西北区级机关委员会，于本月四日，召集了机关支部书记及学习负责同志会议。根据西北局关于在职干部学习通知的精神，由赵守一委员，就学习党史的目的、方法作了说明和具体布置。会议规定学习党史的时间，按学习的发展情况，由各机关自行规定。务使每个同志在学习党史以后，对党的历史、党的路线和以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟问题有初步的认识。会议又着重讨论了教员问题。为了加强干部的政治理论学习，会议决定成立党委讲师团，团长由党委书记洗依同志兼任，秘书由党委副书记杨雨林同志兼任，主持日常工作。讲课内容、地区划分、讲师分工等问题，即将由讲师团会议决定。
