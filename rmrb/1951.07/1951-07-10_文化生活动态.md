　　Literary and Art Circles Launch Study of "On Practice"
　　Since the "Literary and Art Gazette" published its editorial "Continuously Open Up the Road to Recognizing Truth in Practice" in Volume 3, Issue 9, and "People's Literature" published He Qifang's essay "On Practice and Literary Creation" in Volume 3, Issue 5, literary and art circles have launched a study of Chairman Mao's outstanding work "On Practice." Lü Ying's "Reading 'On Practice'" (published in Volume 4, Issue 3 of "Literary and Art Gazette") and Xu Shinian's "Studying 'On Practice' to Overcome Dogmatism and Empiricism in Creative Work" (published in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on April 22) both criticized the errors of formalism and naturalism in literary and artistic creation based on the spirit of "On Practice," pointing out that only by personally participating in the struggle to transform reality can literary and art workers deeply and correctly understand and express reality. Tan Zhi's "Practice and Creation" (published in Volume 5, Issue 3 of "Fiction") criticized several undesirable tendencies and creative problems in literary creation, illustrating the importance of practice to creation. The ABC Literary Group of Tsinghua University collectively discussed and wrote "'On Practice' and the Integration of Literary Creation" (published in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on April 16), which, based on their own experiences, solved the problems of why they could not write works, why they could not write good works, and how to avoid generalization and conceptualization in their works. Liu Zuchun's "The People Need a Large Number of Popular Works" (published in the "Changjiang Daily" on May 27) pointed out, based on certain arguments in "On Practice," that the basic problem in the literary and art work of the Central South Region at present is not the debate between popularization or improvement, or who to serve, but the problem of the unity of theory and practice, that is, the concrete practice of serving the masses. He called on literary and art workers to create a large number of works that the broad masses of people love to see and hear. Li Guangtian delivered a speech at the Central Institute of Literature, "'On Practice' and Literary Work" (the lecture is published in Volume 4, Issue 1 of "Literary and Art Gazette"), in which he explained, based on "On Practice," that all different forms of literature and art come from practice and return to practice, and its role is to transform the world. Zhou Wen has raised different opinions on some of these points (see "Two Points for Discussion" in Volume 4, Issue 3 of "Literary and Art Gazette"). In addition, many others such as She Shusheng, Chen Qixia, Xu Jie, Guo Shaoyu, He Xingruo, and Ma Tieding have published articles studying "On Practice." However, how to make concrete and profound analysis and self-criticism in connection with the creative practice of literary and art workers themselves remains to be further studied in depth by literary and art workers.
  Shanghai Yue Opera Performers Use Personal Experience to Perform Yue Opera Depicting the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries
　　After the Shanghai Yue Opera circle's big villain Zhang Chunfan was arrested by the People's Government, the Shanghai Yue Opera circle has performed Yue Opera reflecting Zhang's crimes. "Accusing Zhang Chunfan," performed by the Dongshan Yue Opera Troupe, depicted Zhang's crimes in colluding with the enemy and puppets in the countryside, raping women, beating farmers, occupying opera troupes in Shanghai, forcing actress Xing Yueqiao's sister to death, forcing famous actress Xiao Dangui to death, persecuting Fu Quanxiang, and after liberation, pretending to be progressive, harboring landlords and local bullies, and sabotaging land reform. "Xiao Dangui's Suicide," performed by the Fuxing and Chuxin Yue Opera Troupes, was collectively directed and produced by more than 40 veteran Yue Opera performers. All the actors were very familiar with Xiao Dangui and other characters in the play, and most of them had been persecuted by Zhang Chunfan. At the same time, this play implemented co-performance by men and women, which is a major innovation in the work of the Yue Opera circle.
  Art Workers in Various Places Draw Comic Strips on the Thirty-Year History of the CCP's Struggle
　　In celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, many newspapers in various places published comic strips of the thirty-year heroic struggle history of the Communist Party of China on July 1. The Workers' Daily published twelve paintings by Wang Shuhui with lyrics by Dong Guang, the Ta Kung Pao published sixteen paintings by Zheng Wenzhong, the Wenhui Daily published thirty-seven paintings collectively created by Zhao Fengchuan, Gu Yizhou, and Wu Jingbo, the Zhejiang Daily published five paintings collectively created by Zhang Huaijiang, Li Zhenjian, Xia Ziyi, Yang Han, and Gu Hong, and the News Daily published a special cartoon issue, which was a collective creation of one of the cartoon groups of the Shanghai Artists Association. These paintings mainly depict the establishment of the Communist Party and the party's struggle in various periods since its establishment thirty years ago. This victorious history is inseparable from the leadership of the Party's great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. Each painting is accompanied by a brief textual explanation. The production of these comic strips shows the love of art workers for the great and correct Communist Party of China and its leader. Using artistic forms to express the history of the Communist Party of China's struggle and popularizing the history of the Party is very beneficial work.

    文艺界展开对《实践论》的学习
    自三卷九期“文艺报”发表社论“在实践中不断开辟认识真理的道路”、三卷五期“人民文学”发表何其芳的论文“实践论与文艺创作”之后，文艺界已展开了对毛主席杰出著作“实践论”的学习。吕荧的“读‘实践论’”（载四卷三期“文艺报”）和徐士年的“学习‘实践论’克服创作中的公式教条主义和经验主义”（载四月二十二日上海文汇报），都根据“实践论”的精神，批判了文学艺术创作中公式主义、自然主义的错误，指出文艺工作者只有亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争，才能深入地正确地认识现实、表现现实。谭质的“实践与创作”（载五卷三期“小说”）批判了文艺创作工作中几种不良倾向和创作上的一些问题，来说明实践对创作的重要。清华大学ＡＢＣ文艺小组集体讨论写成的“‘实践论’与文艺创作结合问题”（载四月十六日上海文汇报），根据自己的切身经验，解决了为什么写不出作品和为什么写不好作品，以及怎样避免作品一般化和概念化等毛病。刘祖春的“人民需要大量通俗作品”（载五月二十七日“长江日报”），根据“实践论”的某些论点指出了目前中南区文艺工作的基本问题，不是争辩普及或提高、或者为谁服务的问题，而是理论与实践统一的问题，也就是为群众服务的具体实践的问题。他号召文艺工作者大量地创作出广大人民所喜闻乐见的作品来。李广田在中央文学研究所发表了演说“‘实践论’与文艺工作”（讲词载四卷一期“文艺报”），他根据“实践论”说明各种不同的文艺都是从实践中来，回到实践中去的，它的作用是为了改造世界。对其中某些论点，周文已提出不同意见（见四卷三期“文艺报”中“两点商讨”文）。此外，发表学习“实践论”文章的还有佘树声、陈企霞、许杰、郭绍虞、何幸若、马铁丁等多人。但如何结合文艺工作者本身的创作实践作具体深刻的分析检讨，还有待文艺工作者对此文件的继续深入钻研。
  上海越剧艺人以亲身经历  演出表现镇压反革命的越剧
    上海越剧界大恶霸张匪春帆被人民政府逮捕以后，上海越剧界已演出以反映张匪罪行为题材的越剧。东山越艺社演出的“控诉张匪春帆”，表现了张匪在乡间勾结敌伪，强奸妇女，毒打农民，在上海霸占戏班，逼死演员邢月樵之姊，逼死名演员筱丹桂，迫害傅全香，以及在解放后，伪装进步，窝藏地主恶霸，破坏土地改革等罪恶历史。复兴、出新等越剧团演出的“筱丹桂自杀”，是四十多位越剧老戏师傅集体编导的，所有演员与筱丹桂等剧中人物均十分熟悉，且大多数都曾受过张匪的迫害。同时这戏实行男女合演，是越剧界工作上的一大革新。
  各地美术工作者绘制中共三十年斗争史连环画
    在庆祝中国共产党诞生三十周年时，各地不少报纸于七月一日发表了中国共产党三十年英勇斗争史的连环图画。工人日报刊登王叔晖画、东光写词的十二幅，大公报刊登郑文中画的十六幅，文汇报刊登赵枫川、古一舟、吴静波集体创作的三十七幅，浙江日报刊登张怀江、李震坚、夏子颐、杨涵、谷虹集体创作五幅，新闻日报出了一个漫画特辑，是上海美协漫画小组之一的集体创作。这些画主要描写共产党的成立，以及成立后三十年来，党在各个时期的斗争。这个胜利的历史是和党的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导分不开的。每幅画旁，并有扼要的文字说明。这些连环图画的产生，表明了美术工作者对于伟大而正确的中国共产党及其领袖的热爱。运用艺术形式来表现中国共产党的斗争历史，对党史作通俗化的宣传，是很有益的工作。
