Editor's Note: Currently, many cotton-producing areas are experiencing aphid infestations. "Aphids are very serious and must be controlled; cotton procurement and storage are urgent and cannot be relaxed." Without procuring cotton, the yarn factories urgently need cotton; without controlling the aphids, the cotton crop will face even greater problems in the autumn. How can this "contradiction" be resolved? There are no quick and easy solutions. Every cadre must exhibit greater initiative, be unafraid of trouble, and tireless in their efforts. All departments must work closely together, concentrating all fighting power, to engage in this intense struggle. Cotton procurement and storage, and aphid control, are all for the same purpose and should not be considered mutually exclusive. First, propaganda and mobilization work can be completely merged. In the course of aphid control, patriotic and worker-peasant alliance ideological education should and can be carried out, so that cotton farmers understand the relationship between the state and themselves, understand the Party and government's production policies, to encourage their patriotic enthusiasm and production initiative, and to prevent them from despondently and shortsightedly neglecting aphid control and ruining the cotton seedlings. Cotton aphids often recur and require constant struggle. Dividing aphid control and cotton procurement into two distinct phases, and allocating a few days for aphid control and a few days for cotton procurement, is inappropriate. Once the cotton farming masses have been ideologically mobilized, the specific work of cotton procurement and storage does not require too many cadres. It does not take cotton farmers too long to take the cotton from home to the cooperative or cotton collection station. The Nanyang Special District in Henan province adopts the good method of "purchasing by district, concentrating by township, with graded inspection personnel touring the townships for inspection and guidance," which saves manpower and cotton delivery time.

The relevant departments must earnestly cooperate to solve the problems of insufficient purchasing staff and inadequate supply of essential goods for cotton farmers. Unilateral emphasis on departmental work, cadres sent to joint working groups failing to obey unified leadership, only focusing on their own department's business without paying attention to cotton procurement and storage, and even unauthorized absences from working groups; some lower-level grain companies competing to purchase wheat, raising wheat prices, and leaving cotton farmers unable to buy wheat after selling cotton. These departmentalist ideas are extremely harmful and should be quickly corrected.

The cotton procurement and storage work in the Shijiazhuang Special District and Shijiazhuang City was planned relatively early, starting on June 1st and being implemented down to the villages in mid-June. However, as of July 13th, the total cotton purchased and stored, converted to lint, was only 1,931,360 jin, less than a quarter of the total task. Of this, only 381,791 jin of lint were purchased and stored from July 1st to 13th.

When this work was implemented in the villages, thanks to the importance attached to it by Party committees and governments at all levels and the close cooperation of all parties, the cotton procurement and storage work achieved great results in mid-June. After mid-June, due to widespread aphid infestations in cotton fields in various counties, Party and government departments concentrated their efforts on tackling the aphids, and cotton procurement and storage work slackened for a time.

On June 26th, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to the counties, requiring them to make a vigorous effort in early July to complete the cotton procurement and storage work. The counties, through commemorating "July 1st," universally and vigorously implemented the spirit of the Prefectural Committee's instructions; in addition, aphid control had been effective in various counties, so in the four or five days after "July 1st," cotton procurement and storage work was developed again.

However, after only a few days, cotton aphids became rampant again in various counties, and fire spiders and red leaf disease (a result of excessive aphid infestation) also occurred at the same time. According to statistics from the Shijiazhuang Prefecture Administration, this year the total area planted with cotton in the entire prefecture is 2,630,000 mu. As of July 12th, it is estimated that 2,000,000 mu of cotton fields have been infested with aphids and fire spiders. In counties such as Luancheng, Zhao, Yuanshi, and Huolu, cotton seedlings were pulled out because fire spiders could not be cured, or yams were planted in the cotton ridges. In this situation, Party and government cadres in the counties concentrated their efforts on leading cotton farmers to engage in the aphid control and pest eradication campaign. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Prefecture Administration also instructed the counties to make every effort to tackle the aphids, and to closely integrate cotton procurement and storage work under the principle of not hindering aphid control. But in reality, after July 4th and 5th, cotton procurement and storage work had come to a standstill. Because the aphids were so severe, cotton farmers and cadres were very anxious, so cotton procurement work teams were unable to carry out their work, and could not even convene a meeting. After the pest damage became more serious, even county and district cadres could not take care of cooperating with the cotton procurement work. When the cotton procurement work team asked the county cadres for help, the response from the counties was: "Aphid control! Can't spare the time!" Relatively speaking, the county level was still more concerned about cotton procurement and storage work, and often considered and studied this issue. At the district and village level, this was simply not the case.

On the 12th, the Industry and Commerce Section of the Prefecture Administration convened a meeting of cotton procurement work teams from various counties to report on the situation. On the 13th, it also convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various specialized companies, banks, and cooperatives to specifically study how to carry out cotton procurement and storage work. Everyone agreed: "Aphids are very serious and must be controlled; cotton procurement and storage work is very urgent and cannot be relaxed." But no one could figure out a concrete way to combine these two tasks, especially how to allocate and organize the forces below. The meeting finally decided: on the one hand, to request instructions from higher levels, and on the other hand, for the original nine cotton procurement work teams (56 people) to continue to go to the countryside. The work teams planned to concentrate on aphid control work for a few days after going to the countryside on the 19th, and then concentrate on cotton procurement after the 22nd.

Regarding the issue of force organization, the Industry and Commerce Section originally wanted to supplement a new force and expand the organization of the work teams, but the various specialized companies, banks, and cooperatives even refused to accept the original resolution to continue to go to the countryside according to the original organization. Everyone emphasized that departmental work was busy, and they were also carrying out cadre review work, so they really could not spare people. After repeated persuasion and explanation, they reluctantly agreed. Here there is a fundamental problem, that is, the attitude of various specialized companies, banks, cooperatives, and other units towards cotton procurement and storage work. In the joint working group sent down last time, many cadres from various units failed to obey the local leadership well and earnestly perform their duties. The cadres of the Grain Company and Coal Construction Company originally scheduled to participate in the Huolu County working group, without the approval of higher levels, went to work without authorization. The bank cadres, after going down to the countryside, only cared about their own department's business and ignored or relaxed the cotton procurement work. After this situation was reflected in the report, the leading cadres did not seriously criticize it.

The lack of good coordination between the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the cooperative, and various brother companies, and the failure to supply wheat and other necessities, also affected cotton procurement and storage work. For example, the cotton procurement agreement between the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Prefectural Cooperative Marketing Society is still circling around some small issues such as handling fees, delaying the signing. The cooperative cannot report the accounts and cannot receive the money. The cotton farmers carry the cotton and stare blankly because they cannot buy it (such as the market in the fifth district of Zhengding County). After the wheat harvest, the masses need to sell the stored cotton to buy wheat. This is the custom, every year. However, the Grain Company underestimated this situation and simply buried its head in purchasing wheat (the Grain Company's wheat collection task is also very heavy). Some did not leave a certain wheat market for cotton farmers to support cotton procurement, but instead mobilized various lower-level branch companies and teams to launch a rush wheat purchase competition (the branch companies also had deviations in understanding the spirit of the branch company's instructions), so that a phenomenon of the Grain Company, cooperatives and private merchants competing to purchase wheat, raising wheat prices in the market. Cotton farmers cannot buy wheat and are unwilling to sell cotton. When the cotton procurement work team in Shulu County (a non-wheat-producing area) mobilized cotton-storing households to sell cotton, the cotton farmers said: "You said that if you sell cotton, you can give whatever you want, but we just want wheat." Now the Industry and Commerce Section of the Prefecture Administration and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce have discussed with the Grain Company a method of supplying wheat and flour to cotton farmers, and have suspended wheat purchases.

　　购棉储棉中要集中力量突破各种障碍
　  石家庄专区治蚜除虫应与购棉储棉工作紧密结合
　  各专业公司、银行、合作社应克服本位主义思想
    编者按：现在许多产棉地区发生蚜虫。“蚜虫很严重，必须治；购棉储棉工作很急，也不能放松。”不购棉，现在纱厂急需棉花；不治虫，秋后棉花就更成问题。这个“矛盾”怎么解决呢？十分巧妙而又省事的办法是没有的，只有每一个干部都发挥更大的积极性，不怕麻烦，不辞劳苦；各部门紧密配合，集中一切战斗力，投入这场紧张的斗争。购棉储棉和治蚜除虫都是为了同一个目的，不能认为是绝对不能并行的。首先，宣传动员工作就是完全可以合并进行的。在治蚜中，同样应该而且可能进行爱国主义的和工农联盟的思想教育，使棉农认识国家和自己的关系，明白党和政府的生产政策，以鼓舞棉农的爱国热情和生产积极性，使他们不会失望地、短视地放松治蚜而毁掉棉苗。棉蚜时常会复发，需要经常与之作斗争，把治蚜和购棉截然分为两个阶段来做，定出几天治蚜、几天购棉是不妥当的。只要棉农群众已从思想上发动了起来，购棉储棉的具体工作并不需要太多的干部就可以做得了，棉农从家里把棉花拿到合作社或收棉站去也并不需要多长时间。河南南阳专区购棉中“以区为单位收购，以乡为单位集中，分级检验人员到各乡巡回检查指导”，就是节省人力和交棉时间的好办法。
    收购工作人员不够和供应棉农必需物品不足的问题，有关部门必须切实配合解决。片面强调部门工作，派到联合工作组的干部不服从统一的领导，只顾自己部门的业务而不注意购棉储棉，甚至擅自不到工作组去；有的下级粮食公司争购小麦，哄抬麦价，使棉农售棉后买不到麦子。这些本位主义思想是极端有害的，应该赶快纠正。
    石家庄专区和石家庄市的购棉储棉工作是布置得较早的，自六月一日开始，六月中旬贯彻到村。但截至七月十三日，购、储棉花共折皮棉只有一百九十三万一千三百六十斤，不及总任务的四分之一。其中七月一日到十三日，仅购、储皮棉三十八万一千七百九十一斤。
    这个工作贯彻到村时，由于各级党委和政府的重视和各方面的密切配合，六月中旬购、储棉花工作得到了很大成绩。六月中旬以后，由于各县棉田普遍发生蚜虫，党政部门都集中力量去突击治蚜，购棉储棉工作一度松了下来。
    中共石家庄地委于六月二十六日向各县发生指示，要求各县在七月上旬大力突击，完成购棉储棉工作。各县通过纪念“七一”，普遍大力贯彻了地委指示的精神；加以各县治蚜已有成效，所以在“七一”后四、五天中，购储棉花工作又有开展。
    但没有几天，各县棉蚜又猖獗起来，火蜘蛛及红叶病（蚜虫过于严重的结果）也同时发生。据石家庄专署统计，今年全专区共种棉二百六十三万亩，截至七月十二日，发生蚜虫及火蜘蛛的棉田估计有二百来万亩。栾城、赵县、元氏、获鹿等县，均有因火蜘蛛无法救治而拔掉棉苗，或在棉垅中栽上山药的。在这种情况下，各县党、政干部就又集中力量领导棉农投入治蚜灭虫运动。中共石家庄地委和专署亦指示各县，全力突击治蚜；在不妨碍治蚜的原则下，密切结合进行购棉储棉工作。但实际上在七月四、五日以后，购棉储棉工作已陷于停顿状态。因蚜虫很厉害，棉农和干部都挺着急，所以购棉工作组下去以后无法进行工作，连个会都召集不起来。在虫害进一步严重后，连县、区干部也顾不得配合购棉工作了。购棉工作组要求各县干部帮助，各县的回答都是：“治蚜哩！顾不上！”比较起来说，县级对购棉储棉工作还是较关心的，还常考虑和研究这问题。到了区、村就根本没有这回事了。
    专署工商科于十二日召集各县购棉工作组汇报情况。十三日又召开各专业公司、银行及合作社负责干部会议，专门研究如何进行购棉储棉工作。大家一致说：“蚜虫很严重，必须治；购棉储棉工作很急，也不能放松。”但这两个工作究竟应如何结合，特别是下边的力量如何配备与组织，谁也想不出具体办法。会议最后决定：一面请示上级，一面由原来的九个购棉工作组（五十六人）继续下乡。工作组打算于十九日下乡后集中力量作几天治蚜工作，到二十二日以后再集中力量购棉。
    关于力量的组织问题，工商科本来想再补充一部新的力量，扩大工作组的组织，但各专业公司、银行、合作社、则连按原来组织继续下乡的决议都表示不能接受。大家都强调部门工作忙，又正进行审查干部的工作，实在抽不出人。经再三说服解释，才勉强答应了。这里有一个根本问题，就是各专业公司、银行、合作社等单位对购棉储棉工作所持的态度问题。上次派下去的联合工作组中，就有不少单位的干部没有能够很好地服从当地领导，认真履行自己的职务。原定参加获鹿县工作组的粮食公司和煤建公司的干部，不经上级，就擅自不去工作。银行干部下去后只顾作自己部门的业务，不管或放松购棉工作。这情况在汇报中反映出来后，领导干部也未认真进行批评。
    花纱布公司与合作社、各兄弟公司没有结合好，麦子和其他必需品供应不上，也影响了购棉储棉工作。如花纱布公司与专区共销社的购棉协议，至今尚在手续费等一些小问题上打圈子，拖延着没有签订。合作社报不上账来，领不下款去。棉农背去棉花，瞪眼看着不能买（如正定县五区市场）。麦收后，群众需要卖了存棉买小麦，这是习惯，年年如此。但粮食公司对这一情况估计不足，只是埋头购麦（粮食公司收麦任务也很重）。有的就没有给棉农留出来一定的小麦市场，以支持购棉，反而发动各下级支公司及小组展开突击购麦竞赛（支公司领会分公司指示精神也有偏差），以致在市场上形成粮食公司、合作社及私商三方面争购小麦的现象，抬高了麦价。棉农买不到小麦，就不肯出售棉花。购棉工作组在束鹿县（非产麦区）找存棉户动员卖棉时，棉农说：“你们说卖了棉花要啥给啥，俺就是要小麦。”现专署工商科与工商局已与粮食公司商定供应棉农小麦与面粉的办法，并暂停购麦。
