    Difficulties in Capital Construction Can Be Overcome with Subjective Effort—A Few Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong

    To the Editor:

    Since June 16th, the People's Daily has continuously published many facts about the painful losses suffered due to blindly starting construction without correct engineering designs. Judging from the reported materials alone, it can be seen that several hundred billion yuan and several million catties of millet of state property have been wasted. In particular, the water source project of the Andong Smelting Plant, which started construction for more than four months, has seriously failed, costing the state property more than 15 billion yuan.

    I think the People's Daily has sounded the alarm for the leading cadres of each enterprise construction, which is very good. This is not to "obliterate" the achievements of capital construction, but to attach importance to the work of capital construction. As the People's Daily editorial on June 16th said: "Capital construction is the specific path of our country's industrialization and a work of fundamental importance for generations to come." The impact is very significant. Therefore, in order to lay a good foundation for national construction and not to waste the state's valuable property, it is entirely necessary to require every leading cadre of enterprises to pay attention to engineering design.

    Comrade Chen Yougong raised many objective difficulties. We admit that there are indeed difficulties. But our revolutionary working cadres must be able to overcome difficulties and do their work well. Comrade Chen only emphasized the difficulties in his letter and did not seek to improve his work, which is wrong. For example, the implementation of the economic accounting system is indeed not easy; however, the railway bureaus of the Ministry of Railways have been able to fully implement it since "July 1st." This is because they have overcome various difficulties over the past year, formulated plans, cleared warehouses, and determined various standards, so they can implement it. I think Comrade Chen should pay attention to thinking about ways to improve, pay attention to being responsible for the people's cause, and not bow his head in the face of difficulties.

### 基本建设中的困难可用主观努力克服—对陈有功同志的一点意见

    基本建设中的困难可用主观努力克服—对陈有功同志的一点意见编辑同志：
    人民日报自六月十六日起，连续登载了许多关于由于没有正确的工程设计就盲目施工，遭受了惨痛损失的事实。仅就已报道的材料中，可以看出，已使国家财产几百亿元与几百万斤小米耗费掉了。特别如象安东冶炼厂的水源工程，开工四个多月，严重失败，耗费了国家财产一百五十余亿元。
    我觉得，人民日报给每个企业建设的领导干部，敲了警钟，这是非常好的。这并不是把基本建设的成绩“一笔抹杀了”，而是重视基本建设的工作。正如六月十六日人民日报社论上所说：“基本建设是我们国家工业化的具体路程，是百年大计的工作。”影响是非常大的。所以为了把国家建设的基础打好，为了不耗费国家宝贵的财产，要求每个领导企业的干部，重视工程设计，这完全是必要的。
    陈有功同志提出了许多客观困难。我们承认，的确是有困难。但我们革命工作干部就是要能克服困难，使工作做好。陈同志信中只强调了困难，不求努力改进，这是不对的。如象经济核算制的实施，的确是不容易；但铁道部各铁路管理局自“七一”起已能完全实行了。这就是经过一年来克服各种困难，编制了计划，清查了仓库，查定了各种标准，所以就能实施它。我觉得陈同志应注意去想改进的办法，注意对人民事业负责，不要在困难面前低头。
