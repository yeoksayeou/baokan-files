To the Editor:

    Recently, while inspecting the implementation of the patriotic pacts in rural areas, the Xuancheng Prefecture of Southern Anhui discovered serious deviations in the preferential treatment of substitute farming work in some areas. The Xuancheng Prefecture has taken steps to correct this after understanding the situation.

    The deviations are mainly: 1. Some areas adopted a non-focused, universal substitute farming method, placing a heavy burden on the masses. In many villages, an average of about 50% of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers enjoy substitute farming; in some villages, it even reached 100%. For example, in Shangxing Village, Fifth District of Dangtu County, the 11 military dependents' households with 198 mu of cultivated land (including vegetable gardens) all enjoyed substitute farming. Military dependents such as Shang Wenjin and Xue Dashan even sold their surplus labor for short-term work. After the prefectural work team arrived and understood the situation, they re-determined the households eligible for substitute farming through democratic assessment. As a result, only five households met the requirements for substitute farming. This greatly improved the masses' enthusiasm for substitute farming and eliminated the previous concern of seeing preferential treatment work as a "burden."

    2. Arbitrary allocation of services without democratic discussion. Some village cadres often formulate a set of methods without discussing them with the masses. During the rice transplanting season, the cadres of Dongli Village, Fourteenth District of Xuancheng County, subjectively stipulated that 140,000 jin of fertilizer should be distributed to military dependents based on the number of labor households in the village, without consulting the masses. This forced some households with less labor to delay transplanting and slow down wheat harvesting in order to collect fertilizer. Some village cadres who should have provided substitute farming themselves "stayed out of it" and shifted the burden to the masses. For example, in Shengqiao Village, Nanling, even the agricultural association group leaders, militia, and village representatives did not provide substitute farming, which further increased the burden on the masses. According to Xuancheng County, some middle-peasant households with more labor had to bear more than 50 workdays throughout the year. If each workday is paid in grain according to work points, it would cost five to ten jin of rice. The middle peasants are very dissatisfied with this approach.

    3. Due to the large scope of substitute farming, the implementation of a work-point system has led to serious waste. Some military dependents who did not actually need substitute farming, but enjoyed it, simply ate and drank the grain they received in exchange for work points. For example, military dependent Wang Bishou in Jing County, who had 6.1 mu of land, enjoyed full substitute farming. He was assessed to receive seven workdays per mu, with each workday worth five jin of rice. He took all the rice back and ate and drank it casually, while renting his land out to others. Huang Lusheng, a military dependent in the Fifth District of Ningguo County, took 60 jin of grain in exchange for work points and used it to buy wine and meat every day. He finished it in less than ten days, and his fields were left unplanted.

    After understanding the above situation, the Xuancheng Prefecture has decided to convene meetings of military dependents' representatives in various counties to correct these deviations in substitute farming, adopt a fixed substitute farming system, and actively encourage military dependents to participate in production. The aim is to earnestly improve the preferential treatment of substitute farming work, reduce the burden on the masses, and ensure the smooth progress of the patriotic production increase movement.

### 皖南宣城专署纠正代耕工作的偏向

    皖南宣城专署纠正代耕工作的偏向编辑同志：
    皖南宣城专区在最近检查各地农村执行爱国公约情况时，发现部分地区的优抚代耕工作有着严重的偏向。宣城专署了解这个情况后，已进行纠正。
    偏向主要是：一、有的地区采取了无重点的普遍代耕方式，使群众负担很重。很多地区的村庄，烈军工属享受代耕者平均约百分之五十；个别村甚至到百分之百。如当涂县第五区尚兴村军属十一户，耕地一百九十八亩（连菜园在内），全部代耕了；军属尚文进、薛大山等就把家里多出来的劳动力出卖短工。专署工作组到该地工作，了解这个情况后，就通过民主评定重新确定代耕户；结果只有五户合代耕条件。这样，群众代耕情绪大为提高，消除了以往把优抚工作看成是“包袱”的顾虑。
    二、不经民主讨论，硬性摊派勤务。有的村干部，常常不通过群众讨论，就规定出一套办法来。宣城十四区东里村的干部，在插秧期中不通过群众就主观地规定按全村有劳力户摊派给军属施粪十四万斤，致使有的劳力少的户不得不耽误插秧、缓收小麦，专门去拾粪。有些应给军属代耕的村干部自己“置身事外”，把负担转嫁在群众身上，如南陵盛桥村连农会小组长，民兵、村代表都不代耕，这样就使群众负担更重。据宣城县了解，有些家里劳力较多的中农户，全年要负担五十个工以上。每工如按工票出粮就要五斤到十斤大米。中农对这种办法很不满意。
    三、由于代耕面太大，实行工票制造成严重浪费。有的军属实际上不需要代耕，而享受了代耕，就把得到的工票粮领来平白吃喝了。如泾县军属王必受，有田六亩一分，全部享受代耕，每亩评定是给七个工，每工五斤米，他把米全部领回后随便吃喝了，另把田租给别人种。宁国县第五区军属黄录生，把工票粮六十斤领回天天打酒买肉，不上十天就吃喝完了，田荒着不插秧。
    宣城专署了解以上情况后，已决定在各县分头召开军属代表会，纠正代耕中的这些偏向，采取固定代耕制，积极奖励军属参加生产，以认真搞好优抚代耕工作，减轻群众负担，保证爱国增产运动的顺利进行。
