　　My Mother and I
　　Zhu Qiqi
    My mother doted on me—her only son—very much. She saved every penny to make clothes and buy tonics for me. Every Saturday when I came home from school, she would prepare plenty of meat and fish for me to eat and give me money to go to the movies. Every three or four weeks, she would come to the school to change my bedding, wash it, and organize my trunk. Whenever the weather suddenly changed, she would brave the cold or heat to rush to the school and bring me the clothes and bedding I needed. Especially when I was sick, she would take care of me day and night without sleep. I remember once when I had typhoid fever for more than a month, she didn't take off her clothes and go to bed for more than a month. She often said to me, "I have put so much effort into you. You must study hard and earn more money to be filial to me in the future." She spoiled me, for example, when I came home on Saturdays, she would even wash my face and hands for me. This made me unable to leave the small circle of the family. At school, I gradually came into contact with new ideas and sought progress, but my mother's doting had a great impact on my progress. When I participated in the "July 6th" parade (note: that is, the Shanghai Municipal Commemoration of "July 7th" and celebration of the liberation parade in 1949. At that time, there were air raids in Shanghai.), she strongly opposed it. When I ran home soaking wet, I didn't get encouragement and comfort, but a burst of complaints: "I only have one son. What if you get killed by a plane?" When I participated in the school's summer study group, she said the same thing again: "I only have one son. You should stay at home and take good care of your health." When I first prepared to respond to the motherland's call to participate in air defense work, she again used words like "What will I do if you leave? How will I live?" to hinder me. Although she loved me very much, this kind of love didn't give me much warmth. On the contrary, it became a mental burden. Because of my mother's selfish love for me, she prevented my love for the broad masses of people and for the great motherland.
    During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, due to the atrocities of the American invaders in Korea, I raised my awareness. I realized that only by defending the country can we protect our homes. Therefore, when the motherland called on young people to join military cadre schools, I decided that I must go. When I told her my determination, she fainted in anxiety. But my will was firm. I used various methods and watched the movie "They Have a Motherland" with her. She was finally persuaded by me, and she let me go. I joined the Air Force Cadre School.
    Because I joined the military cadre school, my mother progressed. When the two of us broadcast on the People's Radio Station, people from all walks of life called to pay tribute to the glorious mother. I saw tears in her eyes. These were tears of joy, tears of excitement. At first, she thought that if her son went to the military cadre school, she would become a lonely person. But the facts proved that her ideas were completely wrong. Not only did she not lose her son, but she also had thousands of excellent sons; not only was she not lonely, but she also gained the support of people from all walks of life. She began to realize that it was right and glorious for her son to participate in the revolution, and that it was glorious and happy to be the mother of a son who participated in the military cadre school. In the New Year, she received a New Year's card from Mayor Chen Yi, and she spent the New Year with many sons. When she came to visit the cadre school, seeing the eyes of thousands of sons fixed on her, she heard thousands of throats shouting: Salute to the glorious mother! She saw how the Communist Party loved and nurtured the youth of the Mao Zedong era. She saw the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and she understood what she should do.
    After returning to Shanghai, she participated in the Women's Federation work. She wrote to me: "Study hard, defend the motherland's airspace, and live up to my expectations." She also said: "I am now working actively and competing with you in patriotism." Due to her active work, she served as the deputy section chief and executive member of the Welfare Section of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation. In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, she performed very well, organizing more than fifty lanes and more than two thousand housewives.
    In this way, for five months, my love for the family and the family's love for me have been consolidated day by day, consolidated on the unshakable political basis of loving the motherland and loving the people. I love my mother because she can serve the people. My mother loves me even more because I am a national defense soldier defending the motherland.
    At the same time, my mother's transformation has further encouraged me to study hard. I think that we China have millions of such good mothers living happily and working hard, but across the river in Korea, millions of good mothers cannot get happiness. What they get is the enemy's massacre and the destruction of their families. Whenever I think of these things, I must study harder and defend our great motherland.
    My experience is also the experience of thousands of comrades who have joined the military cadre school. From this, it can be seen that with a firm will and courage to move forward, family problems can definitely be solved, and they will be solved very well. At the same time, we can see that the military cadre school is a large furnace that can transform even non-revolutionary families into revolutionary families. Comrades, seize this opportunity and bring your families into the large furnace for transformation!
    I have received a lot of warmth in my family, but I have received even more warmth in the revolutionary family. When we first arrived at the military cadre school, many veteran comrades helped us get wash water and carry our luggage; they covered us with quilts at night; and they lit the brazier for us before we got up in the morning. One good comrade did the most enthusiastically. He was our company commander, Wang Mingyue, the blasting king who was well-known in the Jiaodong Military Region. He had won the title of meritorious service twice. He had used elusive landmine warfare to kill more than a hundred Japanese devils, and he had painstakingly researched and invented more than a dozen new landmines, and created many new methods of planting landmines. Once, I and several classmates went to a forum and came back very late. The lights were on in the room, and our district leader was sitting there. He had already spread out their quilts. At that time, we felt very ashamed, but the district leader said: "At home, your parents care about you, and here we care about you and love you." In addition, the students have also become true comrades here. Some comrades wash the diarrhea-filled pants for comrades with diarrhea. From these examples, we can see the great class friendship of our military cadre school.
    Comrades, in order to defend millions of parents, we must eliminate unnecessary worries and incorrect nostalgia for the family and go to the forefront of national defense! (Originally published in Shanghai Liberation Daily)

　　我和我的母亲
　　朱琦琦
    我的母亲对我——她唯一的儿子非常溺爱。她省吃省用把钱省下来给我做衣服，买补品。每当星期六我从学校回家时，她就准备了大鱼大肉给我吃，准备了钱给我看电影。每隔三四个星期，她就要到学校中来一次，给我换被子，洗被子，整理箱子。每当天气突变时，她就不顾寒冷或酷热赶到校中，把要用的衣服、被褥带给我。尤其当我生病时，她就日夜不睡的看顾我。我记得有一次生伤寒病，生了一个多月，她就一个多月没有脱衣服上床睡过。她常对我说：“我在你身上不知化了多少心血，你一定要好好读书，将来多赚些钱孝顺我。”她把我搞得娇生惯养，譬如在我星期六回家时，连洗脸洗手都要她来给我洗。这样使我离不开家庭的小圈子。我在学校中，渐渐地接触了新思想，要求着进步，但母亲的溺爱对我进步有很大影响。当我参加“七、六”大游行时（按：即一九四九年上海市纪念“七、七”庆祝解放大游行。当时上海时有空袭。），她大大地反对。当我满身淋湿跑回家时，得到的不是鼓励和安慰，而是一阵埋怨：“我只有你一个儿子，如给飞机炸死了怎么办？”当我参加校中暑期学习班时，她又是那一套话：“我只有你一个儿子，还是在家中好好养身体吧。”当我第一次准备响应祖国号召参加防空工作时，她又以“你走了叫我怎样办？叫我怎样活下去？”等话来阻挠我。她虽然非常爱我，但这种爱没有给我多大温暖，相反的，变成了一种思想负担。因为母亲对我自私的爱，阻止了我对广大人民的爱，对伟大祖国的爱。
    在抗美援朝运动中，由于美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行，我提高了认识，我认识了先卫国才能保家。因此，当祖国号召青年参加军事干校时，我就决定了一定要去。当我把我的决心告诉她时，她急得昏了过去。但是我意志坚定，我用了各种方法，和她一起去看“他们有祖国”电影，她终于被我说服了，她让我去了。我参加了空军干部学校。
    由于我参加军事干部学校，我的母亲进步了。当我们俩在人民电台广播时，各个阶层的人民打电话来，向光荣的妈妈致敬。我看到她眼眶中含着眼泪，这是高兴的眼泪，兴奋的眼泪。最初她想儿子参加军事干部学校去了，自己会变成孤独的人。但事实证明，和她的想法完全相反，她不但没有失去她的儿子，而且有了千千万万个优秀的儿子；她不但没有孤独，而且获得了各阶层人民的拥戴。她开始体会到，儿子参加革命是应该的、光荣的，作为一个参加军事干部学校的儿子的母亲是光荣的、幸福的。在新年中，她收到陈毅市长的贺年片，她和许多儿子一起欢度新年。当她到干部学校来访问时，看到千百个儿子的眼睛注视到她的身上，她听到千百个喉咙喊着：向光荣的妈妈致敬。她看到共产党是怎样地爱护着培养着毛泽东时代的青年。她看到了祖国的伟大可爱，她懂得了应该怎样去做。
    回上海后，她参加了妇联工作。她写信给我：“要好好地学习，保卫祖国领空，不负我的期望。”又说：“我现正积极工作，并与你作爱国主义竞赛。”由于工作积极，她担任了上海市妇联的福利科副科长兼执行委员。在镇压反革命工作中，她表现得很好，组织了五十多条里弄二千多个家庭妇女。
    这样五个月来，我对家庭的爱，家庭对我的爱，一天天地巩固着，巩固在不可动摇的爱祖国、爱人民的政治基础上。我爱我的母亲，因为她能为人民服务。我的母亲更爱我，因为我是保卫祖国的国防战士。
    同时由于母亲的转变，更鼓舞着我要好好地学习。我想到，我们中国有着千万个这样好的母亲在幸福地生活着，努力地工作着，但在一江之隔的朝鲜，千百万个好母亲得不到幸福，她们得到的是敌人的屠杀和家破人亡。我一想到这些，我就要更努力地学习，保卫我们伟大的祖国。
    我的经历也是千百个参加军事干部学校同志的经历。这当中可以看出，坚定意志勇往向前，家庭问题是一定能够解决的，而且会解决得很好。同时我们可以看出，军事干部学校是一个大熔炉，也能把不革命的家庭改造成革命的家庭。同学们，掌握着这个机会，把自己的家庭，带到大熔炉中改造一下吧！
    我在家庭中，得到许多温暖，但在革命大家庭中，得到了更多的温暖。当我们刚到军事干部学校时，有许多老同志帮助我们拿洗脸水，帮我们搬行李；晚上给我们盖被子；早上在我们没有起床前就给我们生好火盆。其中有一个好同志，做得最起劲，他就是我们的中队长，是胶东军区无人不知、无人不晓的爆炸大王汪明月同志。他曾获得两次功臣称号。他曾用神出鬼没的地雷战，炸死过一百多个日本鬼子，曾苦心钻研发明出十几种新地雷，又创造了许多埋地雷的新方法。有一次，我和几个同学去开座谈会，很晚才回来，房间里点着灯，坐着我们的区队长，他已把他们的被子铺好了。当时我们感到很惭愧，但区队长说：“在家中有父母关怀你们，在这里就有我们来关怀你们，爱护你们。”此外，同学们到了这里也变成了真正的同志，有的同志替泻肚的同志洗拉屎的裤子。从这些例子，都可看出我们军干校的伟大阶级友爱。
    同学们，为了保卫千千万万个父母，我们要消除对家庭不必要的顾虑及不正确的留恋，走向国防最前哨！（原文载上海解放日报）
