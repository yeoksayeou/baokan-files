Reader's Letters

　　I Grew Up Under the Education of the Party
　　Yan Jinfen, Labor Model of Shijiazhuang Da Xing Cotton Mill
　　"Our Party's birthday is coming, what should I use to celebrate the Party's 30th anniversary?" I had been thinking about this in my heart for more than a month. If there were no Chinese Communist Party, there would be no me today – Yan Jinfen! I can't help but think: How did I become who I am today under the education of the Party!
　　Since I was little, I had nothing to eat and nothing to wear, wandering around as a refugee, with no one to rely on. I entered the factory at the age of eleven. Every time I was beaten or scolded in the factory, I would cry and refuse to go to work at home. "If you don't work, you'll starve," I cried, and my mother cried too. Each time, after crying for a while, I would lower my head and walk into the factory again. At that time, I felt that life was like a long, dark road, and I would never reach the end even if I walked it for a lifetime!
　　The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang and the workers, and light came!
　　Although my understanding of the Party was still vague at that time, the comrades who worked in the factory were kind and caring to me, which moved me, and I put all my strength into production. Later, the comrades who did Party work in the factory patiently helped me understand how the past bitter days came about, what kind of party the Communist Party is, and what kind of country and society we would build in the future. My thoughts gradually became clear, and I joined the Chinese Communist Party.
　　The Party educated me not only to do a good job in production myself but also to motivate others to do a good job. When the factory launched the "machine competition," our group was very backward in production at first, but in the end, we won the red flag twice in a row.
　　When Shijiazhuang City held its first People's Congress, I was elected as a representative; at the meeting, I was also elected as a member of the Municipal People's Government.
　　A poor child who begged for food in childhood is now elected as a member of the Municipal People's Government! Something I never expected in a million years happened to me, I was both happy and panicked! The next day, when I went to the Municipal People's Government, the factory workers wanted to send me by horse, but I didn't want to, but the workers insisted. I felt like I was dreaming when I rode a horse with flowers through the streets! At that time, one thing kept turning over in my mind: this honor was given to me by the people and by the Party!
　　Since I became a member of the Municipal People's Government, the workers often come to me with their problems. I like it when they come to me; but I hate that my ability is low, and I don't know how to do many things, and I am very worried. I talked to Liu Tuo, the secretary of the Party's general branch in the factory, and Liu Tuo encouraged me: "It's not that your ability is low, it's that you haven't done much in the past, just study and you'll be fine." The responsible comrades in the Party also often help me, explaining current affairs and policies to me, and explaining basic political common sense. The more I know, the brighter my eyes become. I often think: I should study hard. The Party has cultivated me like this, and the masses have such great expectations of me, I can't let the Party down, I can't let the masses down.
　　Last September, when the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers was held, I was again selected as a representative by Shijiazhuang City.
　　Going to Beijing to attend the meeting and to see Chairman Mao – my leader, my benefactor, I naturally liked it very much. But I also felt a little uncomfortable in my heart, feeling that my achievements in work were too small. Comrade Liu Tuo said: Going there to attend the meeting is a good learning opportunity. I thought about it, and it was, so I went with courage.
　　There I saw Chairman Mao! I clapped my hands until they were swollen.
　　After coming back, a worker said to me: "Jinfen, you have become a member of the Municipal People's Government, and this time you went to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. Since you came back, I have been watching you carefully to see if you have changed towards us." I said: "How can I change towards everyone! The honor was given to me by everyone, by the Party and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught me at the meeting to learn from the masses, how can I not listen to Chairman Mao's words and break away from the masses?"
　　In March this year, the factory prepared to launch the Ma Hengchang-style group movement, and the trade union leadership decided to select a group from the fine yarn A and B classes to experiment. One group from class A was led by me. Most of the people in this group were young people, and their skills were not bad; but you didn't obey me, and I didn't obey you, and the production was very poor, and the number of "white flowers" produced was famous in the entire workshop. At the beginning, I was also very worried, fearing that I would not do well. At this time, the Party's leading comrades gave me a lot of help, teaching me to first unite all the people in the group. The leading comrades also participated in the group meetings, helping us summarize our work and pointing out the way for us. I helped everyone watch the machines at work and solved work problems; after work, I talked to everyone. Our group slowly became united. Once we were united, the number of "white flowers" produced decreased, and the output naturally increased. In April, our group exceeded the production task by 8.4 percent. In May, our group brewed: "July 1st" is coming soon, our group should be more united and do a good job in production, and use our production achievements to celebrate the Party's birthday. But unexpectedly, due to insufficient cotton, we had to stop the machines in early June. When we heard this news, we were really annoyed, and some people were almost crying! In the newspaper, I saw the State Council's call, and I immediately wrote a letter to the peasant labor models Gao Guandou, Wang Luohe, and Song Luoxue, who went to Beijing with me to attend the meeting, hoping that they would lead the masses to sell cotton and store cotton to solve the country's difficulties and let the cotton mill start work earlier. Our group decided to respond to the call of the National Textile Workers' Union and strive to study during the shutdown, improve our political awareness, and improve our technical and cultural level, preparing to produce better after work starts.
　　This year's "June 1st" Children's Day, several elementary schools asked me to give a report. Those elementary school students were so kind to me! They came out to meet me from so far away, gave me flowers, and let me watch the plays they performed. Since I came back from Beijing last year, these elementary school students often came to my house in groups of three or five. They asked me for pictures, and they also gave me their pictures. They asked me: "Sister Jinfen, how did you become a labor model?" I said: "With the leadership, cultivation, and education of our Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I became a labor model." They asked again: "Can we become like you when we grow up?" I told them about my suffering in the old society, and then I said to them: "Under the leadership of our Chairman Mao, this is really extremely happy. Study hard, and your achievements will be even better than mine in the future." They looked at me with their round, sparkling eyes and said: "Sister Jinfen, we will learn from you when we grow up!" Looking at these smart children, I was very moved, and I said: "Okay, you should also work hard when you grow up, the good things in the world are created by labor. In the new society, labor is the most glorious."
　　My glory was given to me by the Party, and I grew up under the education of the Party. While celebrating the Party's 30th anniversary, it made me think again and again in my heart: "For the Party, for the people, I will work and study harder in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homeland!"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Recorded by Lu Shen)

　　Commemorate the Party's Birthday with Practical Actions
　　Liang Jun, Female Tractor Driver
　　Commemorating the 30th anniversary of the great Chinese Communist Party makes me recall the pain I suffered in the past and compare it with the happiness of today, and a thousand emotions gather at once. I used to live under the oppression of Japanese imperialism and feudal forces. In the fourteen years of the puppet Manchukuo, I never wore a new piece of clothing, and I never ate a few full meals. At that time, I was still young and weak, and I had to work as a child laborer for wealthy families. When "August 15th" came, the savior Communist Party came, and the poor people turned over and had houses and land. I still remember my mother being so moved that tears flowed in her sunken eyes, saying: "The poor really have this day!"
　　Poor children also had a way out and entered revolutionary schools to study. Learning made me wiser and understand class struggle. I have studied the history of the Chinese revolution, read the biographies of martyrs and the stories of the 25,000-mile Long March, and I was moved by the greatness of the martyrs and leaders, which made me love the Party and the motherland even more. I know how I should continue to work. The Party cultivated me, improved my politics and culture, and taught me how to drive a tractor – becoming a tractor driver. I have been to the capital – Beijing, saw the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and shook hands with him. I have also been to the socialist country of the Soviet Union, which is something I never dreamed of. I live in this free Mao Zedong era, how happy and cheerful. The female comrades who participate in mechanical agriculture all say they want to learn from me; I feel that I am not enough, but I have a hundred times the confidence to strive for the victory of agricultural mechanization in the new China.
　　I want to swear to our beloved leader Chairman Mao: I am a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party, and I will never fail the Party's cultivation of me and the leader's care. The Party gives me infinite glory, my contribution is too small, I want to do better, maintain glory and promote glory, and fight for the Party's cause until the last minute of my heartbeat. In today's struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, I guarantee to do the following three things:
　　1. Resolutely implement the patriotic convention and do a good job in the patriotic production increase competition movement.
　　2. Intensify study, master technology, and learn military knowledge, and be willing to go to Korea to participate in the war.
　　3. I personally donate a month's salary to buy airplanes and artillery, and lead the female tractor team to donate money to buy airplanes and artillery by saving fuel and increasing grain production during the wheat harvest and large fields.
　　Finally, let me wish the leader of the Party good health!

　　Under the Education of the Communist Party, I Became a Literary and Artistic Fighter
　　Zhao Jian
　　Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led the Chinese people's revolution and liberated all of China except Taiwan. After liberation, the lives of our working people have greatly changed in politics, economy, and culture.
　　Take me as an example, when I was a child in the countryside, I was so poor that I couldn't even eat bran cakes. Later, when I became an apprentice, the suffering I endured was even worse. I had to do everything, from carrying chamber pots to cooking and catching lice for the boss's wife. My eyes were red from exhaustion, and I still had to serve the mahjong table.
　　Later, although I learned a craft, I was still oppressed and exploited. I sold all my strength, but the money I earned was not enough to fill my stomach; sometimes when I was unemployed, I suffered from cold and hunger even more. I spent twenty years like this.
　　After the liberation of Beijing, I felt like I had come out of hell and saw the blue sky.
　　I enthusiastically participated in trade union activities, participated in study, participated in meetings, and worked hard. I felt like I had taken a大力丸 (invigorating pill), and sometimes I was so busy that I didn't eat all day, and I didn't feel hungry.
　　From that time on, I began to learn culture. At first, I could only write a family letter that was not expressive, but later I slowly learned to write "doggerel" for the factory's mimeographed newsletter, and then I submitted articles to newspapers. During this process, I received help from the editors of the "Workers' Daily", "Beijing Workers", and other newspapers and magazines, who revised my drafts, explained policies, and taught me writing methods. My writing ability and political level gradually improved. From writing "doggerel", I progressed to writing news reports, plays, and even learned to write novels.
　　Under the help and education of the Party, in just two years, I wrote more than 100 articles. Of course, most of these things are relatively rough. Among them, better ones, such as the short essay "Husband and Wife Writing Toad", were selected into the intermediate textbooks of amateur schools; "At the Checkpoint" was selected into the "Collection of Workers' Literary and Artistic Creations", and "Chen Yumei's Tomb Sweeping" (Ping Opera) continued to be performed in theaters and radio stations, and "Workers Smile at the Sun" was also praised by Mr. Ai Qing as a good poem.
　　Because of these budding achievements, the Party and the government transferred me to the Central Literary Research Institute to study, further cultivating me and making me a true literary and artistic fighter of the working class. Such progress of mine would not have been possible without the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, I deeply realize that only the Communist Party is working for the happiness of the working class and all the working people. I have decided not to fail the Party's education of me, I must strengthen my study, use the literary and artistic tools given to me by the Party, work hard to create, and serve the people well.

    我是在党的教养下长大的
    石家庄大兴纱厂劳动模范  阎金芬
    “我们党的生日到了，我该用什么来庆祝党三十周年的生日呢？”在一个多月以前，我心里就不断地想。若是没有中国共产党，也就没有今天的我——阎金芬！我不能不想到：我是怎么在党的教养下，成了现在这样子！
    从小我就是吃没吃的，穿没穿的，逃难在外，无依无靠。在十一岁上就进了工厂。在工厂里每逢挨了打、骂，到家里我就哭着闹着不愿再上班。“不上班就得挨饿”，我哭，娘也哭，每一回都是哭一阵子，又低着头走进工厂里。那时候，我觉着日子就像是一条万里长的黑路，走一辈子也走不到头！
    共产党、解放军把石家庄解放了，把工人解放了，光明来到了！
    当时虽说我对党的认识还很模糊，可是那时在厂里做工作的同志们对我和善、关心，感动了我，我在生产当中就把自己所有的力量都拿出来了。后来，在工厂里做党的工作的同志，极耐心地帮助我，使我认识了过去的苦日子是怎么来的，共产党是个什么样的党，我们以后要建设一个什么样的国家、社会，我的思想慢慢地豁亮了，我参加了中国共产党。
    党教育着我，不光自己把生产搞好，还要带动别人把生产搞好。当厂里开展“分车竞赛”的时候，我们组里当初生产很落后，到最后连得了两次红旗。
    石家庄市开第一届人民代表会的时候，我被推选为代表；在会上，我又当选为市人民政府委员。
    在小时候讨吃要饭的穷孩子，现在被选为市人民政府委员！万辈子料不到的事落在我头上，真是又高兴，又心慌！第二天到市人民政府去，厂里的职工同志们，要用马送我，我不愿意这样，可是职工同志们一定要坚持。我带着花，骑着马从大街上过的时候我真觉得像做梦一样！当时有一件事在我心里翻来覆去地想，这光荣是人民给我的，是党给我的！
    自从我当了市人民政府委员，工友同志们有了什么事就常找我。找我，我喜欢；可就是恨自己能力低，很多事不知该怎么做，心里很发愁。我找工厂党总支书记刘拓同志谈，刘拓同志勉励我：“不是能力低，是过去做得少，学习学习就好了。”党里的负责同志们也经常帮助我，给我讲解时事、政策，讲解政治基本常识。自己多知道一点儿，眼睛就更亮一点儿。我常想：我应该努力学习。党这样培养我，群众对我有这样大的期望，我不能对不起党，对不起群众。
    去年九月，召开全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，我又被石家庄市选为代表。
    到北京去开会，去见毛主席——自己的领袖，自己的恩人，我自然是喜欢得了不的。可是我心里也有点儿难受，觉得自己在工作上成绩太小。刘拓同志说：你到那里去开会是一个很好的学习机会。我一想，也是，就鼓着勇气去了。
    在那里我见了毛主席！我拍巴掌把手都拍肿了。
    回来以后，有一位工友对我说：“金芬，你作了市人民政府委员，这回又到北京见了毛主席。从你回来以后，我就留心看着你，看你是不是对我们变样儿。”我说：“我怎么能对大伙儿变样儿啊！光荣是大伙儿给我的，是党和毛主席给我的。毛主席在会上教我好好向群众学习，我怎么能不听毛主席的话，脱离了群众？”
    今年三月，厂里准备开展马恒昌式小组运动，工会领导上决定从细纱甲、乙两班，一班找出一个小组作试验。甲班的一个组由我来领导。这个小组里，多是青年人，技术也都不坏；可就是你不服我，我不服你，生产搞得很不好，出“白花”多在全车间是有名的。刚开始，我也很发愁，唯恐怕搞不好。这时候，党的领导同志给了我很多帮助，教我首先把全小组的人团结好。开小组会的时候，领导同志也参加，帮我们总结工作，指给我们路。我在上班的时候帮助大伙儿看车，解决工作上的困难；下班后我找大伙儿谈。我们组慢慢团结好了。一团结好，“白花”出得少了，产量自然也就提高了。四月份我们小组超过生产任务百分之八点四。五月间，我们小组就酝酿：快到“七一”了，咱们组更要团结一致，把生产搞好，用咱们的生产成绩，庆祝党的生日。可想不到因为棉花不够，在六月初就要停车。当我们听到这个消息的时候，我们心里真烦，有几个人简直急得要哭！在报上，我看到政务院的号召，我马上就给和我一起到北京开会的农民劳动模范高贯斗、王洛合、宋洛学等同志写了一封信，希望他们带动群众售棉、储棉，好解决国家的困难，让纱厂早些开工。我们小组决意响应全国纺织工会的号召，在停工期间努力学习，提高政治觉悟，提高技术、文化水平，准备以后开了工生产得更好。
    今年“六一”儿童节，有几个小学校让我做报告。那些小学生们对我可亲了！多么远就出来接我，给我献花，让我看他们演的戏。自去年我从北京回来，这些小学生们就常三个一群五个一群到我家里来找我。他们向我要像片，他们也把自己的像片送给我。他们问我：“金芬大姐，你怎么就当了劳动模范了？”我说：“有咱们共产党、毛主席的领导、培养、教育，我才当了劳动模范。”他们又问：“我们大了能不能成你这样儿啊？”我对他们讲说了我在旧社会里受苦受难的情形，然后对他们说：“在咱们毛主席领导下，这真是幸福极了。你们好好念书吧，以后你们的成绩会比我更好。”他们睁着圆滴溜的小眼睛看着我说：“金芬大姐，大了我们也要学你！”看着这些聪明的小孩子们，我非常感动，我说：“好，你们长大了也好好地劳动吧，世界上的好东西都是劳动创造的。在新社会里，劳动最光荣。”
    我的光荣是党给的，我是在党的教养下长大的。在庆祝党三十周年的生日的时候，更使我心里想了又想：“为了党，为了人民，我今后在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，更要加倍地努力工作，努力学习！”
                                                      （路深记）
    以实际行动纪念党的生日
    女拖拉机手  梁军
    纪念伟大的中国共产党三十周年，使我回忆我过去受的痛苦，比一比今日的幸福，一时万感齐集。我过去是在日本帝国主义和封建势力的压迫之下活过来的。伪满十四年，我没穿过一件新衣服，没吃过几顿饱饭。那时我年岁还小，身体瘦弱不堪，还得给富人家做小工。“八一五”来了救星共产党，穷人翻了身，有了房子和土地，还记得我母被感动得，在她那凹凹的眼圈里流着热泪说：“穷人真还有这一天！”
    穷孩子也有了出路，纷纷的进入革命学校里读书。学习使我智慧增长，懂得了阶级斗争。我学过中国革命史，看过烈士传和二万五千里长征故事，为先烈们和领袖的伟大感召，使我对党对祖国更加热爱，我知道我应该怎样干下去。党培养我，提高政治、文化，又学会了开拖拉机——成为拖拉机手。我到过首都——北京，看见了伟大的中国共产党领袖毛主席，还和他握了手。又去过社会主义国家苏联，这真是我做梦也想不到的事。我生活在这自由的毛泽东时代，是多么幸福，多么快活。参加机械农业的女同志，都说要向我学习；我觉得我不够，可是我有百倍信心能争取新中国农业机械化的胜利。
    我要向亲爱的领袖毛主席宣誓：我是个光荣的中国共产党员，决不辜负了党对我的培养，领袖的关怀。党给我无限光荣，我的贡献是太渺小，我要更好的干下去，保持光荣发扬光荣，为党的事业奋斗到心脏跳动的最后一分钟。在抗美援朝保家卫国的今天，我保证做到下面三条：
    一、坚决实行爱国公约，搞好爱国主义丰产竞赛运动。
    二、加紧学习，熟练技术，并学习军事知识，愿赴朝参战。
    三、我个人捐献一个月工薪买飞机大炮，并领导女拖拉机队，在收割小麦、大田当中，用节省油料和增产粮食超额的来捐献买飞机大炮。
    最后，让我祝党的领袖身体健康！
            在共产党的教养下我成了个文艺战士
                      赵坚
    毛主席、共产党领导中国人民革命，已经解放了除台湾之外的全中国。解放以后，我们劳动人民的生活，在政治上、经济上、文化上，都大大变了样。
    就以我来说吧，我小时候在农村，穷得连糠饼子都吃不上。后来当了学徒，受的苦更不用说了。提夜壶、做饭，给老板娘捉虱子，全得干。两眼累得通红，还要侍候麻将桌子。
    后来虽然学会了手艺，还是照样受压迫、受剥削，卖尽了力气，挣的钱吃不饱肚子；有时候失业了，更要挨冻受饿。我就这样过了二十年。
    北京解放后，我就像出了地狱，见了青天。
    我万分热情地参加工会活动，参加学习，参加会议，努力工作。我好像吃了大力丸，有时忙得一天不吃饭，也不觉得饿。
    从那时起，我开始学文化。最初我只会写封词不达意的家信，后来慢慢学着给工厂油印小报写“顺口溜”，进而向报纸投稿。这中间，曾得到《工人日报》、《北京工人》以及其他报纸杂志编辑的帮助，给我改稿子，解释政策，讲写作方法。我的写作能力和政治水平逐渐提高了。从写“顺口溜”，进而写通讯，写小剧，一直学会了写小说。
    我在党的帮助和教养下，才二年的工夫，就写了一百多篇文章。当然这些东西大部分都是比较粗糙的。其中比较好一点的，如《夫妻写蛤蟆》等短文，被选入业余学校中级课本；《检查站上》被选入《工人文艺创作选集》，《陈玉梅上坟》（评剧）也不断在剧院和广播电台演唱，《工人对着太阳笑》还被艾青先生评为好诗。
    因为有了这点萌芽的成绩，党和政府又调我到中央文学研究所学习，进一步培养我，使我真正成为工人阶级的文艺战士。我这样一些进步，要不是在共产党毛主席领导下的新中国，是不可能出现的。因此，我深深体会到，只有共产党，才是为工人阶级、为全体劳动人民谋幸福的。我决定不辜负党对我的教养，一定加强学习，用党交给我的文艺工具，努力创作，好好为人民服务。
