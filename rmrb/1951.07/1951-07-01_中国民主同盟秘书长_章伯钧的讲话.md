Comrade Chairman, fellow comrades:

　　July 1, 1951, is the most glorious and greatest festival in the history of the Chinese people: it is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the political party of the Chinese working class. All Chinese people are celebrating this festival.

　　Today, I represent the China Democratic League in attending this great and glorious celebration of the Party's founding anniversary. All members of our League feel unparalleled excitement, joy, and glory. We want to shout, "Long live the Communist Party! Long live the great Chairman Mao!" and express our heartfelt love and lofty respect to the Party and Chairman Mao!

　　The Chinese people, having eliminated feudalism, driven out all imperialists, annihilated the stubborn reactionary Kuomintang bandit gang and bureaucratic capitalism, implemented land reform, and carried out the heroic struggle of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend peace – all of this has been undertaken by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the heroic Chinese people. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people could not have achieved today's great transformation and could not have stood up. Even our China Democratic League, in its decade of political struggle, could not have guaranteed its persistence to the end, overcome political crises, and avoided taking the wrong path without the leadership and help of the Communist Party. The reactionary bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek once used all vile and vicious means to sabotage and attack us, but the vast majority of our members, because they were able to obtain the leadership of the Communist Party, were able to persevere, develop progress, and become a constituent part of the democratic united front. In the future, we must redouble our efforts to maintain the glorious tradition of the democratic movement and strive, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to follow the Chinese working class on the path to socialism and communism. Therefore, today we must call on all League members to resolve: to loyally support the Chinese working class, to learn from their selfless dedication and labor perspective; to loyally support the People's Liberation Army, to learn from their heroic and skillful fighting, overcoming difficulties, and fearless spirit of sacrifice; to loyally support the Communist Party, to accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and to learn to abide by discipline, practice self-criticism, maintain close ties with the masses, and adopt a style of serving the people; to loyally support Chairman Mao, to study Mao Zedong Thought, and to study Marxist-Leninist theory.

　　We shout: Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese working class! Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　中国民主同盟秘书长
    章伯钧的讲话主席、全体同志们：
    一九五一年七月一日是中国人民历史上最光荣最伟大的节日：它是中国工人阶级政党——中国共产党的三十周年纪念日。全中国人民都在欢呼庆祝这个节日。
    我今天代表中国民主同盟参加这样伟大光荣的建党纪念庆祝大会，我们全盟的盟员都感到无上的兴奋、喜悦、和光荣的。我们要欢呼共产党万岁！伟大的毛主席万岁！向党和毛主席致衷心爱戴的崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民，消灭了封建主义，赶走了一切帝国主义，消灭了顽强的反动国民党匪帮和官僚资本主义，实行了土地改革，进行了抗美援朝保卫和平的英勇战斗，这一切的一切都是中国共产党和毛主席领导英勇的中国人民担当起来的。如果没有共产党来领导，没有毛主席来领导，中国人民是不能够有今天的大翻身，不能够站起来的。就是我们中国民主同盟，在十年来政治斗争中，如果没有得到共产党的领导和帮助，我们也决不能够保证坚持到底，克服政治危机，不走错路的。反动的匪首蒋介石曾经用过一切卑劣毒辣的手段来破坏我们，来打击我们，但是我们绝大多数的盟员因为能够获得共产党的领导，所以能坚持下来，发扬进步，成为民主统一战线的构成部份。我们今后更要加倍努力，保持民主运动的光荣传统，争取在共产党和毛主席领导之下，追随中国工人阶级一同走上社会主义和共产主义大道上去。因此我们今天要号召全盟盟员立下决心：忠诚地拥护中国工人阶级，学习他们的大公无私，和劳动观点；忠诚地拥护人民解放军，学习他们的英勇善战，克服困难，不怕牺牲的精神；忠诚地拥护共产党，接受共产党的领导，学习遵守纪律、自我批评、联系群众和为人民服务的作风；忠诚地拥护毛主席，学习毛主席思想，学习马克思列宁主义的理论。
    我们高呼中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！中国工人阶级万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！
