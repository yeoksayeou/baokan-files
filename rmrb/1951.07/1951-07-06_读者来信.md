Various Basic Construction Projects Cannot Tolerate Layer-by-Layer Subcontracting
Entering into Contracts Cannot Be Careless

Editor:

Your newspaper has recently published a series of reports about serious errors and waste of state property caused by improper construction in basic construction. I think these reports are very meaningful. Leading cadres of all departments—especially the main leading cadres—should carefully study these issues and provide materials from their own departments on this aspect in order to improve the work of basic construction projects in New China.

From my personal understanding, one of the many serious errors in basic construction is the issue of contracting.

In general basic construction, civil engineering accounts for more than 50 percent. At present, in many departments' basic construction, most of the civil engineering relies on external contracting (Beijing and Tianjin are relatively simple, with most projects contracted by the state-owned North China Construction Company).

From what I personally know, there are many problems with relying on external contracting:

	First, layer-by-layer subcontracting, skimping on materials and workmanship

Layer-by-layer subcontracting is a widespread phenomenon. Subcontracting once is commonplace; subcontracting two or three times also exists. For example, a factory building project of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was contracted to the publicly owned Yongmao Construction Company, which then subcontracted it to foreman Zhang Laoping. Originally, the stipulated wage was twelve catties of millet per cubic meter, but after one subcontract, it was increased by two and a half catties of millet. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also contracted the hospital project to the publicly owned Xinsheng Construction Company, which did not do it themselves but subcontracted it to small contractors Li Suifa and Xin Ningchang. Xinsheng Company profited 13 percent from one subcontract, leaving 87 percent of the total project cost. In this case, can skimping on materials and workmanship be avoided?

Publicly owned construction companies such as Yongmao and Xinsheng contract out the work without doing it themselves, which actually encourages small contractors to skimp on materials and workmanship, damaging the people's property and directly or indirectly undermining engineering construction. If the state supervisory and judicial organs do not thoroughly investigate this serious phenomenon, the sin will continue!

	Second, contracts are careless, the content is neither clear nor earnestly implemented

The contract does not clearly stipulate the quality of the project, vaguely stating "no leaks in three years, no collapse in five years, guaranteed for twenty years," all official jargon. Then, what if the guarantee cannot be fulfilled? The contract does not stipulate. The hospital project of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant clearly stipulated the use of Northeast red pine in the contract, but the contractor wanted to change it to white pine. Fortunately, the factory strictly investigated and corrected it. As for the large brick seams in the walls and the incomplete grout, this will inevitably seriously affect the quality. There are no clear solutions for projects that cannot be completed on time. Therefore, contractors are careless about the contract and do not care.

These problems are caused by the ideological style of cadres. Some cadres have an improper style, are corrupt and degenerate. Contractors target their fatal weaknesses, using the methods they used to deal with enemy and puppet personnel, wooing them with gifts and banquets, which has almost become a trend, so that some cadres handling projects often have cases of embezzlement and bribery. For example, a supervisory personnel of a certain department is said to have received bribes four times in a row, embezzling more than 700 catties of millet. Those who accept bribes tacitly allow the sloppiness of the project.

Certain construction enterprises that subcontract layer by layer, certain supervisory personnel with improper style and corruption, are just watching the blood and sweat of the working people being wasted there!

Editor, we should mobilize the workers to expose these sins! We will not allow the economic construction of New China to suffer all kinds of heartbreaking losses.

Crude Methods Used to Manage Children in the济南 Railway Bureau Nursery

Editor:

The Jinan Railway Bureau Nursery often uses improper methods to treat children. For example, when children cry or are naughty, the caregivers do not actively educate the children, but instead lock them in dark rooms, letting them cry there; they even beat and scold the children. The child Jiao Mingyu was once beaten by caregiver Zhao Wenzhen, breaking his lip. Secondly, the nursery also uses feudal superstitious methods to manage children. For example, when the children are sleeping together, in order to get the children to sleep quickly, they scare them by saying: "The tiger is coming! The old cat is coming!" This creates a sense of terror in the children. Therefore, some children cry at night after returning home, not allowing adults to turn off the lights, saying: "Afraid of the tiger, afraid of the old cat!" At the same time, the nursery caregivers do not care enough for the children. For example, some children use eggshells to scoop up sewage from the yard to drink (more than a dozen children have become ill because of this); when caregivers see this, they do not effectively stop them, but instead threaten the children: "If you drink again, if you drink again, I will throw you into the pool to drown!"

Because the children do not live well in the nursery, their spirits are not good. The children's weight is therefore reduced. Therefore, after the children are taken home, they do not want to return to the nursery.

The children's parents have reported these situations to the nursery director Deng Yulan; but she has taken a dismissive attitude. Later, the Railway Worker's Newspaper exposed the nursery's errors. But Director Deng neither replied to the letter nor made a review, nor tried to improve the work. She also told others: "Don't even talk about asking me to review!"

I hope that the Jinan District Railway Workers' Union will quickly send someone to inspect the nursery's work.

    各项基本建设工程不能容许层层转包
    订立合同不能马马虎虎编辑同志：
    贵报最近连续发表了关于基本建设中因为施工不当造成严重错误浪费了国家财产的消息，我以为这些报道是极有意义的，各部门的领导干部—特别是主要领导干部应该很好地研究这些问题，并将自己部门关于这方面的材料提供出来，以便改进新中国的基本建设工程方面的工作。
    据我个人了解，基本建设中的许多严重错误之一，乃是包工问题。
    一般的基本建设，土木工程要占百分之五十以上。目前很多部门的基本建设，土木工程大部分是依靠外面包工（北京、天津还比较单纯，大部工程由国营华北建筑公司来包）。
    据我个人所知，依靠外面包工的问题是很多的：
    第一、层层转包，偷工减料
    层层转包，乃是普遍的现象。转包一次，是家常便饭；转包二次、三次的也是有的。如太原钢铁厂有一部厂房工程包给了公营永茂建筑公司，永茂又转包给工头张老平，原来规定每方工资十二斤小米，转了一下子手，就加上了二斤半小米计算。太原钢铁厂又把医院工程包给公营新生建筑公司，新生自己不做，转包给小包工李隋发、辛宁昌。新生公司经一次转包，获利百分之十三，全部工程费剩下百分之八十七。这么一来，偷工减料还能够避免么？
    公营永茂、新生等建筑公司，自己包了工不做，却转包出去，他们这样作实际就促使小包工偷工减料，损失人民财产，直接或间接地破坏了工程建设。这种严重现象，国家监察和司法机关，如不彻底查究，其罪过还会继续！
        第二、合同马马虎虎，内容既不明确，又不认真执行
    在合同中，没有把工程质量规定清楚，笼笼统统的规定“三年不漏，五年不塌，保固二十年”，全是官样文章。那么，不能保固怎么办呢？合同上却没有规定。太原钢铁厂的医院工程，在合同中明明规定使用东北红松，包商却想改用白松，幸得厂方严格的追究，才改正了。至于砌墙砖缝大了，灌的浆又不满，这就必然会严重影响了质量。工程不能如期完成，也没有明明白白处理的办法。因之包工商人，对于合同，都是马马虎虎，满不在乎。
    这些问题，乃是干部思想作风问题所引出的。有的干部作风不正派，贪污腐化。包商就针对着他们的这种致命的弱点，搬出对付敌伪人员的手段，拉拢他们，送礼、请客，几乎成了风气，以致某些办理工程的干部，常有贪污受贿情形。如某部门监工人员，据说曾一连受了四回贿赂，贪污小米七百多斤。受贿者对于工程的马虎，是默许的。
    某些层层转包的建筑企业，某些作风不正、贪污腐化的监工人员，就是这样眼睁睁地看着劳动人民的血汗在那里浪费！
    编辑同志，我们应该发动工人群众揭发这些罪过！我们不容许新中国的经济建设遭到各种痛心的损失。 				 赵常虎
    济南铁路局托儿所用粗野方法管理儿童编辑同志：
    济南铁路局托儿所经常采用不正当的方法对待儿童。例如，当小孩子哭闹或者顽皮的时候，保育员不是积极地教育儿童，而是把他们关进黑屋子里，任他们在那里哭喊；甚至打骂儿童。儿童焦明玉曾被保育员赵文贞打得把嘴唇都磕破了。其次，该所并采用封建迷信的方法来管理儿童。比如在孩子们集体睡觉的时候，为了叫孩子们快点睡，便吓唬他们说：“来了老虎啦！来了老猫啦！”这样，就使孩子们产生了一种恐怖心理。因此，有些孩子回家以后，晚间哭着不让大人关电灯，说：“怕老虎，怕老猫！”同时，该所保育员对孩子们的关心也是不够的，例如有些孩子用鸡蛋壳舀院子里的污水喝（已有十多个孩子因此害病）；保育员看见了，不作有效的制止，却恐吓孩子们说：“再喝，再喝就把你丢到池子里淹死！”
    由于孩子们在所里生活得不好，精神也就不好。孩子们的体重因而减轻。因此，孩子们被接回家去之后，就不愿再回托儿所了。
    孩子们的家长，曾把这些情况反映到该所所长邓玉兰那里去；但她采取了不理睬的态度。后来，铁道工人报揭露了该所的错误事实。但邓所长既不去信答复，也不进行检讨，和设法改进工作。她还告诉别人说：“要我检讨，谈也甭谈！”
    我希望济南区铁路工会迅速派人检查该所的工作。
