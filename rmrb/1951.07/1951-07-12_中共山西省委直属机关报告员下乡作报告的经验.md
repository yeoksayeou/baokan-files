　　Experiences of Report Givers from Organizations Directly Under the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee in Going to the Countryside to Give Reports
    Propaganda Department of the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee
    Editor's Note: Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the decision on establishing a propaganda network, Party committees in many parts of the country have established report givers. Their work has played an important role in raising the awareness of the people and promoting various central tasks. The issue now is to make the work of report givers a regular practice. The work experience of report givers from organizations directly under the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published here, proves that it is entirely possible to make the work of report givers a regular practice. In order to make the work of report givers a regular practice, the organizations directly under the Shanxi Provincial Committee have adopted the method of combining central tasks, dispatching report givers to the countryside on a rotating basis to give reports to the people, and stipulating report giver card systems. These methods and systems have been effective in the organizations directly under the Shanxi Provincial Committee, and Party committees in other places can also follow suit.
    The report givers from organizations directly under the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee were established in mid-March. From March 31st to April 29th, in one month, the Provincial Committee organized five batches of report givers, a total of 673 people, to go to 292 villages in Yangqu, Jinyuan, Taigu, Xugou, Yuci, and the third and fifth districts of Taiyuan. They gave reports on issues such as resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries to 93,084 people, answered questions from the masses, and listened to the opinions and demands of the masses. In addition, they organized forums for cadres and the masses in connection with the content of the reports and carried out movements of speaking out grievances, recalling the past, and making comparisons. According to statistics, those who heard the reports and participated in the forums accounted for 54% of the 171,920 people in the villages where the reports were given. In 41,838 households, an average of more than two people per household heard the reports and received patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea.
    Inspired by the reports given by the report givers, the political enthusiasm of the masses was greatly enhanced. They actively put forward opinions and demands on various issues to the report givers. Because the report givers listened to the opinions and demands of the masses and made preliminary handling of these opinions and demands, the relationship between the Party and the people was further strengthened. Among the opinions and demands received by the report givers from the masses, some expressed their hatred for American imperialism and their willingness to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions. Some asked the Party to send people to explain issues to them regularly. Some asked the government to help them solve production difficulties, such as water conservancy, loans, assistance in purchasing new agricultural tools and improved varieties. Many people reported and accused counter-revolutionaries to the report givers after hearing the reports. Some handed over the photos of counter-revolutionaries to the report givers, and some told the report givers the location and situation of those counter-revolutionaries who were hiding their identities, so that the government could arrest them. They were afraid that the report givers would forget, and repeatedly told the report givers to write it down in their notebooks. Some masses knew that the report givers came from the province (provincial-level organs), and also raised criticisms and opinions on the shortcomings and errors of the work of the provincial-level organs. For example, the masses in Jizhen Village, Jinyuan, criticized that some of the waterwheels promoted by the Water Conservancy Bureau could not be used, and the masses in Xiangyang Town, Yangqu, criticized that the court sentenced counter-revolutionaries to light imprisonment, and demanded inspection and handling.
    The comrades who went to the countryside to give reports further recognized the great significance of establishing a propaganda network from their personal experience, and deeply realized that the organization of the propaganda network is needed by the Party and the people, thus eliminating the mistaken idea that the masses only care about production and do not care about national affairs. After the report givers went to the countryside, they were warmly welcomed by the masses everywhere, who asked them to "stay longer" and "come often." During the reports, the masses earnestly raised many questions and opinions, such as "How is the war in Korea going?" "Why was Seoul lost again?" "How should counter-revolutionaries be dealt with?" etc. After the report givers gave reports and answered the questions of the masses, the concerns of the masses were eliminated and their emotions changed. They said: "If we don't resist America and aid Korea, and let them invade China after they conquer Korea, just like the Japanese, how can we survive? We must produce well, eat well, dress warmly, and pay public grain early to support our volunteer troops and the Korean People's Army." "Keep a close eye on the reactionary Yiguandao leaders and special agents, and dig out the eyes of the American devils and the Chiang Yan bandits."
    The work of the report givers from organizations directly under the Shanxi Provincial Committee has been done relatively well, and one of the most important reasons is that the Party committee attaches great importance to it, and the leaders take the lead, thus powerfully promoting this work. Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, Tao Lujia, Minister of the Propaganda Department, and Shi Jiyan, Deputy Minister, gave four mobilization reports on establishing the work of report givers in succession at the beginning of the establishment of report givers. Deputy Minister Shi Jiyan and responsible comrades of various units personally led teams to the countryside to give reports, and summarized and exchanged experiences in a timely manner. These have played a decisive role in the development of the work of report givers.
    The better experiences that the report givers from organizations directly under the Shanxi Provincial Committee have gained in carrying out their work are:
    First, the content of the reports must be closely integrated with the ideological reality of the masses, and the masses should be educated with their own examples and experiences. For example, after the Chinese and Korean People's troops temporarily withdrew from Seoul, counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to carry out activities, and reactionary landlords also threatened and retaliated against the masses, and the masses had some concerns. After we learned about the above situation, we gave reports to the masses on the relationship between resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the truth that the Chinese and Korean people will win, exposing the enemy's rumors, and the morale of the masses was greatly boosted. When we learned that the masses thought that resisting America and aiding Korea was only about sending troops and grain, we gave reports to people from all walks of life on how to combine their own work to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions. When we talked about opposing American imperialism's arming of Japan, we linked it with the atrocities of Japanese imperialism that were familiar to the local masses, and the brutal examples of the United States slaughtering people in Korea today. This deepened the masses' hatred of American imperialism even more. For example, in Xugou, when we talked about the murder of Yao Qiaoxian's husband in the southwest of Chengguan by the Japanese invaders and the atrocities of American imperialism in Korea, some listeners gritted their teeth and some were angry and wept; when we turned to talk about the heroic deeds and victories of the Chinese and Korean People's troops, the listeners were all elated.
    Second, after the report, the masses can be organized to hold forums, speak out grievances, recall the past, and make comparisons according to the content of the report. However, to convene a forum, good preparations must be made in advance, and the content of the forum should be based on the masses' own personal experiences and real examples. In this way, let the masses think about the past tragic situation to stimulate the masses' hatred for the enemy; look at the happy times today to enhance their love for the motherland and their support for the government. If the forum is held well, it will have a great educational significance for the masses. In some places, after the forum, the masses passed a protest against American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, formulated a patriotic covenant, and discussed production increase plans. The masses in Shuixiu Village, Taigu, said: "The front uses guns and bullets to resist America, and we in the rear use shovels, hoes, and axes to resist America." Zhang Gui, a farmer in Southwest Wa Village, Yangqu, said in his grievance comparison: "When Yan Xishan was in power, I was begging for food; after liberation, I was allocated a house and land, found a partner, and had children. This is all thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We can't let the bad guys destroy such a good life." These all show that the masses educated themselves and improved themselves in the process of speaking out grievances.
    Third, when report givers give reports, they should, according to the situation in the location where the report is given, convene various mass meetings as much as possible, and give reports in this meeting. In this way, the masses in the area can hear the reports universally, and the content of the reports can be better integrated with the ideological situation of the masses, so that the reports can achieve better results. When the report givers gave reports in Xugou County, they first gave reports to organized cadres and masses (county-level organ cadres, representatives of the Resist America and Aid Korea Congress, village cadres, women, students, teachers, militiamen, businessmen, Christians, etc.), and then convened five residents' meetings to give reports specifically to the residents. As a result, more than 2,800 cadres and residents out of the 5,000 people in Chengguan heard the reports. On average, more than three people per household out of the 900 households in the city heard the reports.
    Fourth, before the report givers go to the countryside, they must ask the responsible comrades of the Party committee in the area to report on the work situation and the ideological situation of the masses, in order to understand the specific situation of the local area, and write a report outline according to the local situation. The report outline should be reviewed by the branch, and a lecture rehearsal meeting should be organized under the leadership of the general branch to exchange the experience and experience of the report. After going to the countryside, it is necessary to understand the thoughts of the masses and the vivid examples familiar to the masses at any time, and make necessary additions and modifications to the report outline. After arriving in the village, you must explain your intentions to the village cadres, understand their work, and help them to inspire the enthusiasm of the village cadres. The order of giving reports can be from party members to general cadres, from organized masses to unorganized masses. In addition, when going to the village to understand the situation, avoid being all-encompassing. It is necessary to grasp the materials related to your report for investigation and understanding, otherwise, you will lose sight of the other.
    Fifth, report givers can use simple maps, cartoons, picture books, small mobile exhibitions, etc. as auxiliary tools for their reports. They can not only attract the masses, but also help the report givers explain the problems and strengthen the masses' understanding of the reports. When talking about the relationship between China and Korea, using the contiguous Chinese and Korean borders in the map for explanation is easiest for the masses to accept. When talking about the great strength of the new democratic countries connected into one piece and the long front line of the United States' remote war, the masses can understand at a glance by pointing to the map. When the report givers went to Taigu and Xugou to give reports, because they knew in advance that the masses there did not clearly understand the reactionary nature of Yiguandao, in addition to bringing a batch of pictures and picture books, they also brought several reactionary documents of Yiguandao for exhibition among the masses, and the effect was very good.
    Sixth, the establishment of a report giver card system is an important method to supervise and inspect the work of report givers. This card is formulated uniformly by the Provincial Committee and is brought by the report giver to the Party Committee where the report is given. After the report giver gives the report, the local Party Committee fills in the opinions and other requirements of the listeners on it, and then transfers it to the Provincial Committee as a basis for checking the work of the report giver. According to existing experience, the masses attach great importance to the report giver card. In addition to putting forward their opinions on the report giver on the card, they actively put forward requirements and criticisms to the government. Therefore, the report giver card can not only help check the work of the report giver, but also enable the Party and the government to understand the requirements of the masses. Report givers should explain the requirements and problems raised by the masses to the local Party Committee (including the County Party Committee) before returning to the organ, and exchange opinions. After returning to the Provincial Party Committee organ, they should reorganize them and write a written material to notify the relevant departments for inspection and handling. Some of them can be published in newspapers to attract everyone's attention. The Provincial Committee must also exhibit the report giver cards within the organs, which is of great benefit to helping report givers improve their work.

### 中共山西省委直属机关报告员下乡作报告的经验

　　中共山西省委直属机关报告员下乡作报告的经验
    中共山西省委宣传部
    编者按：自中国共产党中央发布关于建立宣传网的决定以来，全国许多地方的中国共产党的党委都已建立起报告员来，他们的工作对于提高人民群众觉悟及推动各项中心工作都起了重要作用。今后的问题，就是要使报告员的工作经常化。这里所发表的中国共产党山西省委直属机关报告员的工作经验，证明使报告员工作经常化是完全可能的。山西省委直属机关为了使报告员的工作经常化，采取了结合中心工作，按期轮批派遣报告员下乡对人民群众作报告的办法，并规定了报告员卡片等制度。这些办法和制度在山西省委直属机关中已行之有效，其他地方的党委也可以仿行。
    中国共产党山西省委直属机关的报告员是三月中旬建立起来的。自三月三十一日至四月二十九日一个月中，省委组织了五批报告员共六百七十三人，到阳曲、晋源、太谷、徐沟、榆次、太原三、五区的二百九十二个村庄，向九万三千零八十四人作了关于抗美援朝、镇压反革命等问题的报告，解答了群众的询问，倾听了群众的意见及要求；此外，并联系报告内容，组织了干部、群众座谈会，进行了诉苦、回忆、对比运动。据统计，听到报告及参加座谈者占报告所在村十七万一千九百二十人的百分之五十四；在四万一千八百三十八户中每户平均有二人以上听了报告，受到抗美援朝爱国主义的教育。
    在报告员所作报告的启发下，群众的政治积极性大大提高，他们纷纷向报告员提出关于各种问题的意见与要求。由于报告员倾听了群众的意见与要求，并对这些意见与要求作了初步的处理，结果更加密切了党与人民群众的联系。在报告员收到的群众的意见与要求中，有的是表示对美帝国主义的仇恨与他们将如何以实际行动抗美援朝的意愿的；有的是要求党经常派人给他们讲解问题的；有的是要求政府帮助他们解决生产上的困难的，诸如水利、贷款、帮助购置新式农具及优良品种等；有许多人听了报告后并向报告员检举与控诉反革命分子，有的将反革命分子的像片交给报告员，有的将那些隐姓埋名的反革命分子的地点、情况告诉报告员，让政府扣捕，他们怕报告员忘掉，再三嘱咐报告员记在本子上。有些群众知道报告员是从省里（省级机关）去的，对省级机关工作的缺点及错误也提出了批评和意见，如晋源棘针村群众对水利局推销的水车有的不能用，阳曲向阳镇群众对法院判处反革命分子徒刑过轻等，都提出了批评，并要求检查处理。
    下乡作了报告的同志从亲身经验中，进一步认识了建立宣传网的伟大意义，深刻地体会了宣传网的组织是党和人民群众所需要的，从而消除了认为群众只顾生产，不管国家大事的错误认识。报告员下乡后，到处受到群众的热烈欢迎，要求“多住”“常来”。在报告中间，群众认真地提出许多询问、意见，诸如“朝鲜的仗打的怎样？”“汉城为什么又丢了？”“反革命分子如何处理？”等。在报告员作了报告与解答了群众的询问后，群众的顾虑即行消除，情绪为之一变。他们说：“不抗美援朝，让他打下朝鲜进来中国，和日本人一样，那咱还能活。咱们一定要好好生产，吃饱穿暖，早缴公粮，支援咱志愿部队和朝鲜人民军。”“好好的瞅住反动的一贯道首和特务分子，把美国鬼子和蒋阎匪帮的眼挖了。”
    山西省委直属机关报告员工作所以做的比较好，其中一个很重要的原因是党委重视，首长以身作则、因而有力地推动了这一工作。省委书记赖若愚同志、宣传部长陶鲁笳同志、副部长史纪言同志在开始设立报告员时，接连作了四次关于建立报告员工作的动员报告。史纪言副部长及各单位负责同志亲自带队下乡作报告，及时地总结和交流了经验，这些都对报告员工作的开展起了决定的作用。
    山西省委直属机关报告员在进行工作中所已获得的较好的经验是：
    第一、报告内容必须密切结合群众的思想实际，以群众自己的事例、经验教育群众。如中朝人民部队暂时撤出汉城后，反革命分子乘机活动，反动地主也向群众进行恐吓倒算，群众有所顾虑，我们了解了上述情况后，即将抗美援朝与镇压反革命的关系，及中朝人民必胜的道理向群众作了报告，揭破了敌人的造谣，群众情绪为之一振。当我们了解了群众认为抗美援朝只是出兵出粮时，我们即向各界群众作了如何结合本身业务以实际行动抗美援朝的报告。我们讲反对美帝国主义武装日本时，联系当地群众所熟知的日本帝国主义的暴行，与今日美国在朝鲜屠杀人民的残暴事例，这样就更加深了群众对美帝国主义的仇恨。如在徐沟讲了城关西南方姚巧仙的男人被日寇杀害与美帝国主义在朝鲜的兽行，听众有的切齿，有的愤怒流泪；当转而讲到中朝人民部队英勇事迹和胜利的时候，听众都兴高采烈。
    第二、在报告后可根据报告内容，组织群众座谈，进行诉苦、回忆、对比。但召开座谈会，事前必须有很好的准备，要以群众自己切身的经验和真实的事例为座谈内容。这样让群众想想过去悲苦情景，以激发群众对敌人的仇恨；看看今天欢乐的时光，以增强其对祖国的热爱与对政府的拥戴。座谈会开的好，对群众有很大教育意义。有些地方的群众经过座谈，通过了反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的抗议书，订立了爱国公约，讨论了增产计划。太谷水秀村的群众说：“前方抗美用枪炮子弹，咱们后方抗美要用锹镢斧头。”阳曲西南洼村农民张贵在诉苦对比中说：“阎锡山在时我讨吃；解放后我分到房子分到地，找下对象，有了小孩，这都是共产党毛主席的恩典，这样的好日子可不能让坏家伙们破坏。”这些都说明群众在诉苦中自己教育了自己，提高了自己。
    第三、报告员作报告时，应按照报告所在地的情况，尽可能分别召开各种群众的会议，在这个会议中进行报告。这样，既可使该地区的群众普遍听到报告，也可使报告内容更好地结合群众的思想情况，使报告收到更好的效果。报告员在徐沟县城作报告时，首先向有组织的干部、群众（县级机关干部，抗美援朝代表会代表、村干部、妇女、学生、教员、民兵、商人、基督教徒等）作了报告，然后又召开了五个居民会，专门向居民作了报告。结果城关五千人中即有二千八百余干部、居民听了报告。全城九百户中，平均每户有三个多人听了报告。
    第四、报告员下乡前，须请所到地区的党委负责同志报告工作情况与群众思想情况，以便了解当地的具体情况，并根据当地情况写出报告提纲。报告提纲应交支部审查，并在总支的领导下组织讲演预习会，交换报告的心得与经验。下乡后，须随时了解群众思想和群众熟知的生动事例，将报告提纲再加以必要的补充和修改。到村后，必须向村干部说明来意，了解其工作，并予以帮助，以启发村干部的积极性。作报告的顺序，可由党员到一般干部，由有组织的群众到无组织的群众。另外，到村了解情况时，切忌面面俱到，要抓住对自己报告有关的材料进行调查了解，否则，将会顾此失彼。
    第五、报告员可利用简明地图、漫画、小人书、小型流动展览等作自己报告的辅助工具。它们既可吸引群众，又可帮助报告员说明问题，加强群众对报告的了解。讲中朝关系时，用地图中的中朝地界毗连作解释，群众最易接受。讲新民主主义国家连成一片力量大，美国后方远战线长时，一指地图，群众即一目了然。报告员到太谷、徐沟报告时，因预先得知该地群众对一贯道的反动性认识得不大清楚，因此，除带了一批图片、小人书外，还带了几件一贯道的反动证件在群众中展览，效果很好。
    第六、建立报告员卡片制度，是督促和检查报告员工作的重要方法。这种卡片由省委统一制订，由报告员带交报告所在地的党委，报告员报告后，当地党委即把听众对报告的意见及其他要求填写在上面，然后即转交省委，以作检查报告员工作的根据。根据已有的经验，群众对报告员卡片是十分重视的，他们除了在卡片上提出他们对报告员的意见外，并积极提出对政府的要求及批评。因此，报告员卡片一方面可以帮助对报告员工作的检查，另外亦可使党与政府了解群众的要求。对群众提出的要求和问题，报告员都应在返机关前向当地党委（包括县委在内）作交代，并交换意见，返省委机关后，再加以整理，写成书面材料通知有关部门作检查与处理。有一部分可在报纸上公布，以引起大家的注意。省委也须将报告员卡片在机关内部展览，这对于帮助报告员改进自己的工作有很大好处。
