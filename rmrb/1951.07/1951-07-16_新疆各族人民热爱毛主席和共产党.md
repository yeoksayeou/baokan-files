　　Xinjiang's People of All Ethnicities Love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party
　　(By our Special Correspondent Hu Zhong)
　　　　Sunflowers turn towards the sun,
　　　　All ethnic groups want to follow our Communist Party.
　　　　With Halsuk Chi (Mongolian: Savior) Chairman Mao,
　　　　A happy life is guaranteed!
　　From the Altai Mountains to the Pamir Plateau in the westernmost part of the motherland, throughout this vast Xinjiang region, one can hear the songs of the people of all ethnic groups praising the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, and their own happy lives.
　　Why do the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang sing so enthusiastically? The people of Turpan answered this way:
　　After liberation, what made us happiest was seeing the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, who care for and protect the interests of the people. We have a People's Government that serves the people, and we have reasonable burden and rent reduction policies. The People's Government allows the people to hold meetings and speak freely, discussing issues freely. These are all the benefits that Chairman Mao has brought to the people.
　　The answer of the people of Turpan speaks to the heart of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In the year and more since Xinjiang's liberation, its face has been changing rapidly. The era of disaster and suffering for the people has passed, and the people's Xinjiang is gradually growing stronger and larger.
　　This historical change is multifaceted, but the two most significant are:
　　First, the Chinese Communist Party has correctly implemented its ethnic policies. This has changed the phenomenon of mutual hatred and estrangement among ethnic groups caused by reactionary rule, enabling the people of all ethnic groups to unite in a large family of equality, friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance. From the day Xinjiang was liberated, the Chinese Communist Party has been paying attention to cultivating local ethnic minority cadres. All counties have promoted local ethnic minority cadres and let them take on leadership roles. The short-term training classes sponsored by the local Communist Party committees have trained more than 8,000 ethnic minority cadres. The Tajik ethnic group, with only over 10,000 people living in Puli County on the Pamir Plateau, also has 150 cadres of its own ethnic group. The Tajik people said gratefully, "Chairman Mao's red sun shines on the Pamir Plateau, reviving our Tajik people and bringing us lasting light and youth."
　　Because the Chinese Communist Party has conscientiously and responsibly cultivated a large number of ethnic minority cadres in Xinjiang, and because the Han cadres serve the people of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly, the people of all ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang have changed their attitude towards the Han people.
　　Second, the Chinese Communist Party has correctly implemented the policy of developing production, enabling the people of Xinjiang to begin to escape poverty. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, agricultural production in Xinjiang has greatly developed; last year, a reasonable burden agricultural tax policy was implemented. The lives of the vast majority of farmers have been preliminarily improved. Many farmers have added carts, farm tools, horses, and new Chapan (the collarless long outer garment worn by the Uyghur people), and built new houses. In Kewozi Village, Three Township, Three District, Hotan County, 70 of the 196 households in the village were forced to go begging due to the exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary government. But now this situation has completely changed. Those who had no food at home now have surplus grain; those who went begging have gradually returned to production.
　　The lives of Xinjiang's 800,000 herdsmen have also improved significantly. In the Ili region, Mongolian herdsmen used to be able to exchange one cow for only one and a half to two bolts of cloth, but now they can exchange these things for only one medium-sized cowhide.
　　The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang understand that this happy life is brought by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Huerbai, a Kazakh herder from Sulai County, said, "Chairman Mao is always young, he is hotter than the sun's rays, and he is stronger than the wind. With Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in China, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been liberated. Whenever I see a portrait of Chairman Mao, I gain great strength. With Chairman Mao, we working people have hope."

### 新疆各族人民热爱毛主席和共产党

　　新疆各族人民热爱毛主席和共产党
    （本报特约记者胡中）
        向日葵朝着太阳转，
        各族人民要跟咱共产党。
        有了哈尔苏克奇（蒙语：救星）毛主席，
        幸福的生活就有了保障！
    从阿尔泰山到祖国最西部的帕米尔高原，在这辽阔的新疆境内，到处可以听见各族人民对于共产党、毛主席、人民政府、人民解放军和自己幸福生活的歌颂。
    为什么新疆各民族人民这样热情地歌颂呢？吐鲁番人民做了这样的回答：
    解放以后，我们最高兴的是看见了关心和保护人民利益的共产党、人民解放军。我们有了给人民办事的人民政府，有了合理负担和减租政策。人民政府让人民群众开会说话，自由地讨论问题。这都是毛主席领导人民得到的好处。
    吐鲁番人民的回答道出了新疆各民族人民的心声。新疆解放一年多来，她的面貌正在迅速地改变着。给人民以灾难痛苦的时代已经过去了，人民的新疆正在日渐壮大和成长起来。
    这个历史性的变化是多方面的，但最显著的有两个：
    首先是中国共产党正确地执行了民族政策。这就改变了反动统治时期所造成的各民族互相仇视和隔阂的现象，使各民族人民团结在平等、友好、合作、互助的大家庭里。从新疆解放的那一天起，中国共产党便注意了培养本地民族干部。各县都提拔了当地民族的干部，让他们担任领导工作。各地共产党党委所主办的短期训练班，已培养八千多名民族干部。聚居在帕米尔高原蒲犁县的仅有一万多人口的塔吉克民族，也有了一百五十名本民族的干部。塔吉克人民感激地说：“毛主席的红太阳照到了帕米尔高原，复活了我们塔吉克民族，给我们带来了长年的光明和青春。”
    由于中国共产党在新疆认真负责地培养了大批民族干部，由于汉族干部全心全意为各民族人民服务，新疆各少数民族人民已改变了对汉族人民的态度。
    其次是中国共产党正确地执行了发展生产的政策，使新疆人民开始脱离贫困状态。在共产党、人民政府的领导和驻新疆人民解放军的援助下，新疆人民的农业生产有了很大的发展；去年又实行了合理负担的农业税政策。广大农民的生活已有了初步改善。不少农民添置了大车、农具、马匹和新袷袢（维吾尔族人民所穿的无领长外衣），建筑了新的房舍。和阗县三区三乡克窝孜村，过去因受国民党反动政府的剥削，全村一百九十六户中有七十户被迫出门行乞。但是如今这个情况完全改变了，家里断粮的现在有了余粮；出门行乞的，也陆续回来生产了。
    新疆八十万牧民的生活，现在也有了显著的改善。伊犁专区的蒙族牧民过去以一头牛只能换一匹半至二匹布，现在只用一张中等牛皮，就可以换得这些东西。
    新疆各民族人民懂得这种幸福生活是毛主席和共产党带来的。绥来县哈萨克族牧民呼尔拜说：“毛主席永远是年轻的，他比太阳的光芒还要热，他比风的力量还要大。中国有了毛主席和共产党，新疆各族人民才得翻了身。我一看到毛主席像，我便得了很大的力量，有了毛主席，我们劳动人民就有了希望。”
