　　The national railway administrations have implemented the economic accounting system since July 1st. The railway department had made necessary preparations beforehand. Firstly, since the takeover, the national railways successively carried out a series of democratic reforms: personnel, organization, and salaries were adjusted, management committees and employee representative assemblies were established, and a large number of worker activists were promoted to cadres, enabling the vast number of employees to establish a sense of ownership. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the class consciousness of the workers has been further enhanced, which laid the foundation for all employees to consciously implement the economic accounting system.

　　Secondly, the railway department reformed some financial work systems. For example, to implement the economic accounting system and calculate the profit and loss of each enterprise unit separately, an independent accounting system must be implemented. In the past, the accounting systems of railway units were very chaotic, and there was no settlement system for inter-bureau joint transportation, so the management bureau units could not calculate their own profit and loss. On January 1, last year, the Ministry of Railways issued the "Provisional Railway Accounting System," which initially unified the national railway accounting system. On January 1 this year, the "Unified Railway Accounting System" was further promulgated, eliminating the chaos of accounting systems in the railway department in the past. Since then, the management bureau can calculate the overall profit and loss of the bureau in a timely manner, establishing an independent accounting system.

　　Implementing the economic accounting system requires first determining working capital. Due to the nationwide material inventory conducted for four months last year, the determination of working capital quotas had a preliminary basis. The nationwide material inventory work started in April last year, with the participation of half of the national railway employees. A total of more than 20,000 tons of stagnant materials, more than 3,300 tons of off-book materials, and more than 143,700 tons of waste materials were cleared out. Together with the materials collected, unearthed, and contributed by employees, the total value reached 452.7333 billion yuan. In the work, each unit also discovered some major shortcomings in material management in the past, such as the lack of unified procedures for material management, and frequent inconsistencies between materials and material accounts. Therefore, a material management responsibility system and a material inspection system were established, which laid a good foundation for the scientific management of materials by the railway administrations after the implementation of the economic accounting system this year.

　　In order to implement quota management for each basic unit when implementing the economic accounting system, the railway administrations first investigated and determined the work-hour quotas and material quotas for various tasks. The basic units of the national railways have investigated and determined 20,371 work-hour quotas and 8,765 material quotas through patriotic production competitions (excluding medium and long routes). The work-hour and material quota problems of basic units such as locomotive depots and vehicle inspection depots have been basically resolved. In this way, the railway administrations have a reliable guarantee for overfulfilling this year's production and financial plan.

### 铁路部门实行经济核算制前作了一系列必需的准备工作

　　铁路部门实行经济核算制前作了一系列必需的准备工作
    全国各铁路管理局已自七月一日起实行经济核算制。事先铁路部门曾作了必需的准备工作。首先，全国铁路自接管后就先后进行了一系列的民主改革：调整了人事、机构和薪金，建立了管理委员会和职工代表会，提拔了大批工人积极分子作干部，使广大职工树立了主人翁思想。自抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动开展以来，职工阶级觉悟更加提高，这就打下了全体职工自觉执行经济核算制的基础。
    其次，铁路部门改革了一些财务工作制度。如要实施经济核算制，单独计算本企业单位的盈亏，就必须实行独立会计制。而过去铁路各单位会计制度非常混乱，各路局间联运亦无清算制度，管理局单位就无法核算自己的盈亏。去年一月一日铁道部颁布了《铁路暂行会计制度》，初步统一了全国铁路的会计制度，今年一月一日起又进一步颁布了《铁路统一会计制度》，消除了过去铁路部门中会计制度的混乱现象。自此，管理局可以及时核算全局的盈亏，建立了独立会计制度。
    实行经济核算制必先确定流动资金。由于去年曾进行了历时四个月的全国材料大清查，流动资金定额的核定就有了初步依据。全国材料大清查工作是去年四月开始的，参加的人员占全国铁路职工的半数，计共清理出呆料两万多吨，账外料三千三百多吨，废料十四万三千七百多吨，加上搜集、挖掘和职工献纳的材料，总值达四千五百二十七亿三千三百余万元。在工作中各单位并发现过去材料管理上的若干重大缺点，如材料管理缺乏统一的手续，材料与料账经常不相符合等。因而建立了材料管理负责制、材料检查制等，这就为今年各铁路管理局实行经济核算制后科学管理材料工作打下了良好基础。
    铁路管理局为了在实行经济核算制时能对各基层单位进行定额管理，首先查定了各项工作的工时定额与材料定额。全国铁路各基层单位曾通过爱国主义生产竞赛查定了工时定额二万零三百七十一件和材料定额八千七百六十五件（均不包括中长路）。机务段、检车段等基层单位的工时定额与材料定额问题已基本上得到解决。这样各铁路管理局超额完成今年生产财务计划就有了可靠的保证。
