　　"July 1st" is the anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, and this year marks its 30th anniversary. This is a glorious and great day in the history of New China. Since the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party in China, a fundamental change has taken place in the history of the Chinese people. That is, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the broad revolutionary Chinese people, after thirty years of arduous struggle, finally overthrew the Kuomintang reactionaries' bloody rule over the Chinese people. It liberated the disaster-ridden Chinese nation and the Chinese people from thousands of years of feudal oppression, a hundred years of imperialist oppression, and decades of bureaucratic capitalist oppression and exploitation, and established an independent, free, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong New China. This is an earth-shattering change. This change had never occurred in the history of old China. It only began after the emergence of the newest type of proletarian political party armed with Marxism-Leninism and the theory combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution—Mao Zedong Thought—the Chinese Communist Party. The reason why the Chinese Communist Party can lead the Chinese revolution to victory is that the Chinese Communist Party is a party of the working class, a Marxist-Leninist party, the most politically visionary, and the most organized and disciplined party. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, it not only carried out irreconcilable struggles with enemies at home and abroad, but also crushed various opportunistic tendencies within the Party. Comrade Mao Zedong is the outstanding leader of our Party, the leader of the people of the whole country, and the organizer and leader of our Party and the modern Chinese revolution. He taught us to "serve the people wholeheartedly."

　　For thirty years, all the sacrifices, efforts, and struggles of us Communists have been advancing along the path prescribed by Chairman Mao. Everything is based on the interests of the people, always loyal to the interests of the people, and carrying out unyielding struggles for this interest. Therefore, it can consolidate the connection between the Party and the masses of the people, win the trust and support of the broad masses, and enable our Party to grow from small to large, develop into a large political party with millions of members today, which is the focus of attention of the people of the whole country and is regarded as their only savior by the people of the whole country. Therefore, it can continuously overcome difficulties and achieve revolutionary victory in the long-term struggle to lead the Chinese revolution.

　　The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army led by the Chinese Communist Party. It is an army that serves the people wholeheartedly. It is an army personally organized and built by Chairman Mao, and it is the armed force of the Chinese people themselves. The basic task of this people's army is to defend the interests of the Chinese people and strike at the enemies of the Chinese people. The reason why this people's army can grow and develop, why it can resolutely sacrifice and struggle for the interests of the Chinese people, be invincible, and demonstrate its high political consciousness is none other than the leadership of the Communist Party, the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the education of the correct revolutionary line, principles, and policies, and the guidance of Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics. Therefore, it can defeat all reactionaries and achieve victory in armed struggle.

　　As we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party, all Party members and comrades in our army must deeply study the history of the Party, study Mao Zedong Thought, and the strategies and tactics he created, and build a very powerful army to defend the motherland in organization, politics, and military affairs. At this time, when the aggressive group headed by US imperialism is waging a war of aggression in our neighbor, Korea, directly threatening the security of our motherland, we must make persistent efforts, resolutely strive, and deeply implement the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, without any slackening. Domestically, we must resolutely guarantee the completion of the land reform task and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and build our new country. We cannot allow any imperialists to invade an inch of our country's territory, and we cannot allow feudal forces to continue to exist. Under the leadership of the Party, we must resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, and we must ensure that New China steadily moves from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a new democratic society to a socialist society and a communist society.

　　在毛主席的旗帜下胜利前进
    贺龙
    “七一”是中国共产党的诞生纪念日，于今已是三十周年了，这是新中国的历史上一个光荣而伟大的日子。在中国自从有了中国共产党，中国人民的历史，就发生了一个根本的变化。这就是广大的革命的中国人民，在中国共产党和它的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，经过了三十年来的艰苦斗争，最后打倒了国民党反动派对于中国人民的血腥统治。把灾难深重的中华民族和中国人民，从几千年来的封建压迫、百年来的帝国主义压迫、几十年来的官僚资本主义压迫和剥削之下解放了出来，建立了独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国。这是一个翻天覆地的大变化。这个变化，在旧中国的历史上是未曾有过的，只是在有了以马列主义的理论与中国革命的实践相结合的思想——毛泽东思想所武装起来的最新式的无产阶级政党——中国共产党之后，才开始的。中国共产党所以能领导中国革命走向胜利，这是因为中国共产党是工人阶级的、马克思列宁主义的政党，是最有政治远见，最有组织性与纪律性的政党。在伟大的毛泽东思想指导之下，不但和国内外的敌人作了不调和的斗争，而且粉碎了党内各种各色的机会主义。毛泽东同志是我党杰出的领袖，和全国人民的领袖，是我党和现代中国革命的组织者与领导者。他教导我们要“全心全意为人民服务”。
    三十年来我们共产党员一切牺牲、努力与奋斗，都是遵循着毛主席所规定的道路前进的。一切都是以人民的利益为依归，始终忠实于人民的利益，并为这个利益进行不屈不挠的斗争，因而它就能巩固党与人民群众的联系，获得了广大群众的信赖与拥护，就能使我党由小到大，发展成为今天数百万党员、而为全国人民所集中仰望的并为全国人民认为是他们唯一救星的大政党了。因此它就能在长期的领导中国革命斗争中，不断克服困难，取得革命的胜利。
    中国人民解放军，是中国共产党领导的军队。它是全心全意为人民服务的军队，它是毛主席亲手组织与建设起来的军队，是中国人民自己的武装力量。这个人民军队的基本任务，就是保卫中国人民的利益，打击中国人民的敌人。这个人民军队所以能够壮大与发展，所以能够坚决为中国人民的利益牺牲奋斗，所向无敌，表现它高度的政治觉悟，其原因没有别的，就是因为有共产党的领导，有马列主义毛泽东思想的教育，有革命的正确路线、方针与政策的教育，有毛主席的战略战术的指导。所以它就能够战胜一切反动派，而取得武装斗争的胜利。
    我们纪念党的三十周年的生日，我们军队中的全体党员和全体同志，都必须深刻学习党的历史，学习毛泽东思想，和他所创造的战略战术，在组织上、政治上、军事上建设成为一支保卫祖国的十分强大的军队。当此世界以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团正在我国邻邦朝鲜进行侵略战争，直接威胁到我祖国安全的时候，我们必须再接再厉，坚决努力，深入贯彻抗美援朝运动，不容稍怠。在国内必须坚决保证土地改革任务与镇压反革命工作的完成，以巩固人民民主专政，建设我们的新国家。我们不能容许任何帝国主义者来侵略我国的一寸领土，不能容许封建势力继续存在。在党的领导下，我们要坚决的将革命进行到底，要保障新中国稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义的社会，进到社会主义社会和共产主义社会。
