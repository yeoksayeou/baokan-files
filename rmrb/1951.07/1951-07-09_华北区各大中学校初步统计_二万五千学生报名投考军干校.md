　　Preliminary Statistics from Major Universities and Middle Schools in North China
    25,000 Students Apply to Military Cadre Schools
    [This Newspaper's Report] (Xinhua News Agency): Students from universities and middle schools in North China are enthusiastically applying to various military cadre schools. According to preliminary statistics, the number of applicants has reached over 25,000.
    Students in various regions are warmly responding to the call of the State Council of the Central People's Government for enrollment in various military cadre schools. After thorough deliberation, and inspired by patriotic fervor, they are voluntarily signing up. In Beijing and Tianjin, the number of applicants from universities and middle schools has reached 10,076. In Pingyuan Province, 5,326 students from eighteen middle schools have applied. In Anyang City, Henan Province, the students of No. 1 Middle School showed great enthusiasm during the application process. The desks of the recommendation committee were piled high with students' applications and letters of determination. In Tangshan City, Hebei Province, on July 2nd alone, over 1,500 students applied. The Young Pioneers of Peiren Girls' Middle School in the city celebrated the patriotic actions of their older siblings with waist drums. After Fu Xiu, a junior middle school student at Beijing Jingcun Girls' Middle School, applied, her mother made her a new quilt and new clothes, and told her neighbors, "I feel even more reassured to hand my child over to the motherland."
    Many parents are actively encouraging their children to apply. Huang Shuzong's uncle, a student at the affiliated middle school of Tianjin Jingu University, said at a parents' meeting, "Last time when the military cadre school was recruiting, I encouraged my son to participate. He wrote to me from the military cadre school and told me that his learning was progressing rapidly. This time I encouraged my nephew to apply." Liang Weici's mother, a junior middle school student at Tangshan Middle School, encouraged her daughter to apply after hearing the news of the military school enrollment. Shi Zhentang's father, a student at Kailuan Middle School, encouraged his son with the fact that his brother was slaughtered by the Japanese invaders, saying, "The American devils are now rearming Japan. You should join the military school and study hard to prepare to avenge your uncle."
    The enrollment committees and school recommendation committees of various provinces and cities in North China are working hard to handle the application review and physical examination of students. Students recommended by schools in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong in Chahar Province, and Chahan South District have gathered in Zhangjiakou. Receiving stations have been established successively in the locations of the provincial people's governments to receive and send students participating in the military cadre schools.
