Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health Accepts Criticism
    The union dues of all municipal hospitals have been allocated in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law.
    To the Editors:
    The criticism made by reader Liu Ling in the People's Daily on March 21 regarding the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health's delay in paying union dues is correct. We conducted a review immediately after reading it. In the past, we lacked the necessary understanding of trade union organizations and trade union work, and we did not pay enough attention to the Trade Union Law. Therefore, we did not take a firm grip on solving the problem of union dues for the various municipal hospitals. Around August and September of last year, some municipal hospitals requested the Bureau of Public Health to approve the issuance of union dues. However, we only forwarded the official documents to the Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau and did not take serious responsibility for resolving the issue. In October of last year, the Municipal People's Government forwarded a joint directive from the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government on the allocation of union dues. We also failed to study it carefully and simply forwarded the notice to various hospitals and health centers without diligently urging its implementation afterward. The above practices all demonstrated an inappropriate attitude of procrastination and perfunctoriness. After seeing reader Liu Ling's criticism, we changed our past erroneous attitude and began to earnestly check and resolve the issue. Since April, the union dues of all municipal hospitals and health centers have been fully allocated in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law. In addition, from March to May 5, the union dues owed from August of last year to March of this year have been fully paid. Regarding the issue of deducting employee study fees from the supplementary union dues, we have conducted research together with the Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and with the consent of the grassroots trade unions, it has been decided that the union dues from November of last year to March of this year will be fully paid (without deducting employee study fees). However, study fees will be deducted from the union dues allocated before October of last year.

    The Summer Palace Management Office Decides
    To Strengthen Education for Tour Guides
    To the Editors:
    Regarding the two suggestions made by reader Xu Qinbin on June 13 concerning our park, we have conducted an inspection.
    The tour guides at the Summer Palace are not employees of our park. Most of them are residents from nearby areas, and some have worked at the Summer Palace before. After liberation, in order to help them progress, we issued newly compiled concise tour guides and held meetings to educate them on how to conduct tours. However, due to insufficient subjective efforts on our part and the deep influence of old ideas on them, errors still occur from time to time during explanations. After seeing Comrade Xu Qinbin's criticism, they spontaneously held group discussion meetings. We have decided to pay attention to strengthening their education in the future.
    Regarding the explanations of the cultural relics in the exhibition rooms, our park specially hired experts from the Palace Museum in April to help us identify the cultural relics. We are now labeling them, providing explanatory labels on each relic, and setting up explanatory signs at various historical sites.

    Editor's Note: The tour guides of the Summer Palace, regardless of whether they are formal employees of the Summer Palace, their work is indeed part of the park's work, and it is very important because it directly affects the work results of the Summer Palace. Therefore, the Summer Palace Management Office should strengthen its leadership over these tour guides; the Management Office should be responsible for the quality of their work.

    Insufficiently Accessible Explanations of Cultural Relics at the Temple of Heaven
    The Management Office Has Decided to Revise Them
    To the Editors:
    The two suggestions made by reader Jingbo on June 13 regarding the management of the Temple of Heaven are sincerely accepted by our office.
    Regarding the issue of insufficiently accessible explanations of the cultural relics at the Temple of Heaven, our office had already noticed this. However, we used the excuse that some ancient cultural relics have specialized terms (such as "箐" [qìng] and "簋" [guǐ]), and that changing them to common language explanations might lose the original meaning, and we procrastinated, failing to revise the explanations of the cultural relics. This is an irresponsible work style towards tourists. We will definitely revise all the cultural relic explanations in the near future.
    Regarding the issue of worker Wang Fengshan promoting superstition to tourists, this shows that our office's education for workers who are deeply poisoned by old ideas is not thorough enough. In addition to providing individual education to this employee, our office has decided to strengthen the professional learning of all workers in the park to improve their political awareness, correct their incorrect understanding of history, and better serve tourists.

    Shanghai Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory
    Accepts Readers' Criticism and Is Determined to Correct Mistakes
    To the Editors:
    The readers' letters page of the People's Daily on June 20 published reader Ning Shi's criticism of our factory for entering into a contract with the East China Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to dye 3,000 bolts of youth mercerized "Haichang Shilin" blue cloth, and for delivering second-grade products mixed in with the order, and his hope that we would conduct a deep self-examination. We conducted an inspection immediately after reading it. During the dyeing process of this batch of cloth, due to technical shortcomings, some of the cloth (about 1,500 yards) was of poorer quality. Forty bolts had already been selected and prepared for self-sale as second-grade products. However, because the delivery deadline had arrived and the goods were still short, the person in charge of the factory's engineering department added these forty bolts to make up the full amount and delivered them to the warehouse together. The sales department also failed to declare this to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company when delivering the goods. It was only after the company discovered it that it requested a price reduction, which confirms that we committed an error of attempting to deceive. This irresponsible and dishonest work style is unacceptable. After the fact, we wrote to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, requesting that the second-grade products be priced down and that we be given the punishment we deserve according to the contract. We are willing to accept the readers' criticism and are determined to correct our mistakes, guaranteeing that such incidents will not occur again in the future.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    北京市公共卫生局接受批评
    各市立医院的工会经费已按工会法的规定拨缴编辑同志：
    三月二十一日人民日报刊登的读者刘令对北京市公共卫生局迟迟不缴工会经费的批评是正确的。我们看到后即作了检讨。由于过去我们对工会组织及工会工作缺乏应有的认识，对工会法不够重视，所以对解决各市立医院的工会经费问题，也就抓的不紧。在去年八、九月间，即曾有一些市立医院，请求卫生局批准发给工会经费，而我们只将公文转到市人民政府财政局，并未认真负责地去解决这个问题。至去年十月份，市人民政府曾转发了中央人民政府劳动部和财政部联合对拨交工会经费的指示，我们亦未认真研究，只是照文将通知转发各医院及卫生所，以后亦未认真督促执行。以上这种作法都表现了不应有的拖延应付态度。我们看到读者刘令的批评后，即改变了过去的错误态度，开始抓紧检查解决。自四月开始，各市立医院及卫生所的工会经费，已全部按工会法的规定拨缴；另外，自三月起至五月五日止，已将去年八月至今年三月所应缴的工会经费全部缴清。关于在补缴的工会经费内扣除职工的学习费问题，已会同市人民政府财政局与市总工会作了研究，并取得了基层工会的同意，决定自去年十一月至今年三月的工会经费完全补缴（不扣职工学习费），但拨缴去年十月以前的工会经费则扣除学习费。

    颐和园管理处决定
    加强对导游人员的教育编辑同志：
    六月十三日读者徐勤彬同志对我园提出的两点意见，我们对此已进行了检查。
    颐和园向导人员并非我园工作人员。他们多是附近居民，也有曾在颐和园做过事的。解放后，我们为了帮助他们进步，曾发给新编的简要的导游说明，并开会教育他们怎样导游。但是由于我们主观努力还不够，他们所受旧意识影响太深，所以解说时仍不时有错误发生。看到徐勤彬同志的批评后，他们自动地开了小组讨论会。我们决定今后注意加强对他们的教育。
    关于陈列室古物说明，我园已于四月间特聘故宫博物院专家帮助我们将古物作了鉴定，现在正进行标注，在每件古物上标签说明，并在各古迹设立说明牌。
                颐和园管理处
    编者按：颐和园的导游人员，无论其是否为颐和园的正式工作人员，但他们所做的工作确是该园的一部分工作，而且是很重要的，因为它直接影响颐和园的工作效果。因此，颐和园管理处应加强对这些导游人员的领导；他们工作的好、坏，颐和园管理处应负责任。
    天坛文物解说不够通俗
    管理处已决定修改编辑同志：
    六月十三日读者镜波同志对天坛管理工作提出的两点建议，我处诚恳接受。
    关于天坛文物解说不通俗问题，本处早已发觉。但我们却以古代文物有些专用名词（如“箐”“簋”等），如改用通俗语言解释恐失掉原意为理由，迁延时日，迄未将文物解释修改。这是一种对游人不负责任的作风。我们一定在最近期间把文物说明一律修改。
    关于工人王凤山向游客宣传迷信问题，这说明本处对受旧思想毒害较深的工人教育不够深入。我处除对该员进行个别教育外，决定加强全园工人的业务学习，使他们提高政治水平，纠正对历史的不正确的认识，更好地为游人服务。

    接受读者批评决心改正错误编辑同志：
    人民日报六月二十日读者来信专页刊载读者宁士批评我厂与中国花纱布公司华东区公司订约代染青年丝光海昌士林性蓝布三千匹，将二等品搭交，希望深自检讨。我们看到后即进行了检查。这批代染布匹，在染色过程中，由于技术上的缺点，致有少量布匹（约一千五百余码）质量较差，原已拣出了四十匹，准备作二等品自销，但因交货限期已到，而货尚缺额，为了争取准期交货，厂内工务部负责者就将这四十匹抵补足额，一并交仓。而营业部在交货时亦未向花纱布公司声明。到该公司发现后，始请求除价，确已犯了企图蒙混的错误。这种不负责不老实的作风，是要不得的。事后我们经函请花纱布公司，将二等品照除价格外，并请按照合同给以应得的处罚。我们愿接受读者的批评，决心纠正自己的错误，保证以后不再发生此类事件。
