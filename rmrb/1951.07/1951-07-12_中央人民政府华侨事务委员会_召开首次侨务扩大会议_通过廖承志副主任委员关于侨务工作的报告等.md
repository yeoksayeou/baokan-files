Over the past year and more, overseas Chinese abroad, regardless of the increasingly urgent persecution by imperialism and the sabotage of the Kuomintang bandit gang, are gradually moving towards the path of unity and progress; the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese in various places abroad is being strengthened and expanded day by day. Therefore, with the support of our strong motherland, implementing the policy of doing our best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, crushing the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang bandit gang that betrays the country and harms overseas Chinese, and promoting the great patriotic unity of overseas Chinese in various places abroad are the current tasks of overseas Chinese affairs work and the current direction of efforts for overseas Chinese abroad.
