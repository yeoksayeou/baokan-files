The people of the old revolutionary base areas in western Fujian Province, during the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, are rebuilding villages destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops and actively restoring production, under the leadership and assistance of the Central People's Government, the Fujian Provincial People's Government, and the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

In 1929, Chairman Mao led the Red Army in an eastward expedition from Jiangxi, liberating large areas of western Fujian Province. At that time, Longyan, Shanghang, Yongding, and four other counties implemented land reform under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. For more than twenty years, approximately 150,000 people in Longyan, Shanghang, Yongding, and other counties, under the leadership of the Communist Party, persisted in guerrilla warfare, defeating countless attacks by the Kuomintang bandit troops and crushing various conspiracies by the landlord class to attempt restoration. Until the victory of the Liberation War, they still maintained the results of the land reform from twenty years prior.

After the liberation of Fujian Province, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Fujian Provincial People's Government issued instructions to Party committees and governments at all levels throughout the province regarding the work of old revolutionary areas. The Central People's Government has successively allocated 4 million jin of grain to relieve the people in the old revolutionary areas of Fujian Province. The 9 million jin of relief grain allocated by the Provincial People's Government last year, as well as various rural loans and reductions or exemptions from public grain burdens, have also been specially taken care of in the old revolutionary areas.

The thousands of villages in the old revolutionary areas of Fujian Province that were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops are now being rebuilt, and the people who were forced to flee are returning to their hometowns to resume production. In Longyan, Shanghang, and Yongding counties alone, nearly two thousand houses have been built. In Chouling Township, Zherong County, 414 people have returned to their hometowns to resume production. They have now reclaimed more than 1,200 mu of wasteland, bought 14 head of cattle, and added a large number of farm implements. In addition, some villages have also built schools. The children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in the old revolutionary areas are admitted to school free of charge. Those with financial difficulties can also receive subsidies of 30 to 80 jin of rice per month.

　　闽西人民重建家园
    福建省第二次国内革命战争时期革命根据地的人民，在中央人民政府、福建省人民政府和中共福建省委会的领导和帮助下，正在重建被国民党匪军所毁灭的村庄，并积极恢复生产。
    一九二九年，毛主席率领红军由江西东征，解放了福建省西部大片地区。当时，龙岩、上杭、永定等七个县，在中国共产党领导下实行了土地改革。二十多年间，龙岩、上杭、永定等县约有十五万人民在共产党的领导下一直坚持游击战争，打败了国民党匪军无数次的进攻，粉碎了地主阶级企图复辟的各种诡计。一直到解放战争胜利时，他们还保持着二十年前土地改革的成果。
    福建省解放后，中共福建省委员会和福建省人民政府曾分别给全省各级党委和各级人民政府发出关于做好老革命地区工作的指示。中央人民政府曾先后拨粮四百万斤，救济福建省老革命地区的人民。省人民政府去年拨发的九百万斤救济粮以及农村的各种贷款和减免公粮负担等，对老革命地区也都特别加以照顾。
    福建省老革命地区被国民党匪军所毁灭的千百个村庄，现在正在重新修建，被迫流离失所的人民也纷纷返乡生产。仅龙岩、上杭、永定三县，已修建房屋近两千间。柘荣县绸岭乡已有四百一十四人返乡生产。他们现已开荒一千二百余亩，买进耕牛十四头，还增添了大批的农具。此外，有的村庄还修建了学校。老革命地区革命烈士和革命军人的子弟，都免费入学。其中生活困难的，每人每月还能得到三十斤至八十斤大米的资助。
