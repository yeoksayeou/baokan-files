Title: Watching the Machine Harvest Wheat

This year, when the state-owned Jiheng Mechanized Farm in Hebei Province harvested wheat, many farmers from nearby villages made a special trip to watch the combine harvester at work. At that time, in a golden wheat field, the huge harvester ran back and forth, the roar of the engine shaking the fields. The harvester had a ten-foot-long horizontal wheel at the front, and with just one turn, the heavy ears of wheat were fed into it. In an instant, the harvester spat out the threshed stalks and chaff. Large tracts of wheat fields were quickly harvested, and the large iron box of the harvester was filled with clean wheat grains. Then, the harvester dumped the wheat onto trucks, which transported it to the threshing ground, load after load.

The farmers watched, their eyes wide and their mouths open. Some were checking whether the ground was cleanly cut; some were grabbing a handful of chaff, blowing it, and checking if any wheat remained; some were looking down, calculating the harvester's efficiency.

“It can harvest three mu of land in the time it takes to smoke a pipe, including harvesting, threshing, and winnowing, and it harvests very cleanly. The work done in the time it takes to smoke a pipe is equivalent to the work of two laborers and one ox.” This was their initial conclusion after watching the combine harvester harvest wheat.

The state-owned Jiheng Farm is located between Ji County and Hengshui County in Hebei Province. Three years ago, it was a wasteland covered with weeds, waterlogged in summer, and with a surface of saline-alkali that was snow-white in winter. Not only could farmers not cultivate and use this land, but it was also a breeding ground for locusts. After the farm was established, the workers drove machines to cultivate the land, destroying this "locust nest," and reclaimed 15,000 mu of arable land, growing good wheat. The farm staff told the visiting farmers, "We have been using machines to reclaim land for only three years. Last year, we harvested 400,000 jin of wheat, and this year we can harvest 500,000 jin."

After the visit, the farmers were very interested in machine farming and surrounded the farm staff, asking questions. The workers said, "This is a Stalin No. 4 automatic combine harvester. It uses one and a half jin of gasoline per hour and can harvest fifteen mu of wheat." They also said, "The farmers in Soviet collective farms completely use this gadget (referring to the machine) to grow crops. When our country is industrialized in the future, and when we reach a socialist society, everyone will use this gadget to farm, how wonderful that would be!" The farmers listened and laughed happily.

Zhao Jingmao, a liberated farmer from Nanliang Village in Ji County, used to hear cadres say that in the future socialist society, farms would use machines to grow crops, which would increase grain production and allow the people to live a good life. He never believed it. This time, he saw that machine farming did indeed yield more, turning wasteland into fertile land, and that one machine was better than a hundred oxen. He realized that using machines to farm could indeed lead to a good life, and he was convinced by what the cadres said. All the farmers who watched the combine harvester harvest wheat now envied the farmers in Soviet collective farms and longed for a socialist society. They said, "The farm is a beacon, illuminating our hearts." Now, they are even more enthusiastic about mutual aid in production. They say that they will work hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao and move towards a happy life.

### 看机器割麦子

　　看机器割麦子
　　张华
    今年，河北省国营冀衡机耕农场收麦子的时候，农场附近有很多农民特地跑去看收割机割麦子。当时，一片金黄的麦田里，庞大的收割机在往返奔跑着，轰隆的马达声震荡着田野。收割机前面有一个一丈长的横卧着的轮子只那么一转，沉甸甸的麦穗就被吃进去了。一霎时，收割机就吐出了脱了粒的麦杆和麦糠。大片的麦地很快就被割光，收割机的大铁箱里装满了干净的麦粒。然后，收割机把麦子吐在载重汽车上，一汽车一汽车地送到晒麦的场上去。
    农民们一个个看得睁大着眼睛裂开了嘴。他们有的在察看地里割得干净不干净；有的抓起一把麦糠吹着，看里面还剩有麦子没有；有的低着头在计算收割机的效率。
    “吸一袋烟的工夫就能收三亩，连收带打，连扬场都在内，还收得很干净。这一袋烟的工夫，就能顶两个人工和一个牛工啊。”这是他们看了收割机割麦后发表的初步结论。
    国营冀衡农场，在河北省冀县和衡水两县之间。那里三年前还是一片荒草，夏天积水，冬天地面泛出硝碱，一面雪白。这片土地农民不只不能开垦利用，而且还是一个蝗虫的老窝。办农场后，工人们驾着机器来耕地，才把这个“蚂蚱老窝”抄了，开出了一万五千亩耕地，种出了好麦子。农场的工作人员告诉参观的农民说：“我们用机器开荒才三年，去年收了小麦四十万斤，今年能收到五十万斤。”
    参观后，农民们对机器耕地大感兴趣，围着农场工作人员问长问短。工人们说：“这是斯大林四号自动联合收割机，一个钟头用一斤半汽油，能收割十五亩麦子。”又说：“人家苏联集体农场的农民，完全是使这玩艺儿（指机器）种庄稼。将来咱国家工业化以后，到了社会主义社会的时候，大家都用这玩艺儿种地，该多好呀！”农民们听得都高兴地笑起来。
    冀县南良庄有个翻身农民赵京茂，过去听干部们说，将来社会主义社会，办农场用机器种地，就能多打粮食，老百姓都能过好日子。他总不相信。这次他看见机器种地果然收得多，能把荒地变成良田，一架机器胜过一百头牛，用机器种地果然能过好日子，对干部的话才服气了。所有看了机器割麦子的农民，现在都羡慕着苏联集体农场的农民，都很向往社会主义社会。他们说：“农场是一盏明灯，照亮了我们的心眼。”现在，他们对于互助起来生产已更加积极。他们说，要在毛主席领导下努力干，向幸福的日子前进。
