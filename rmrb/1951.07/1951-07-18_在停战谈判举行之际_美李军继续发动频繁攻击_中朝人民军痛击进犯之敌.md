Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 17th: Our front-line reporter reports: Just as the Korean armistice talks began, under the personal deployment of Ridgway and Van Fleet at the front, the American invading forces and the ROK puppet army launched frequent attacks on almost the entire front. The US 24th Division attacked Heights 602.2 and 682 north of Hwachon with two companies on the 11th of this month. After being frustrated, they launched a second attack with two battalions on the 12th. After being repelled again, they launched a third attack with a regiment on the 13th. Only after suffering heavy casualties again did they temporarily stop attacking. In areas west and northwest of Lianchuan, northwest of Tieyuan, and west of Jinhua, US and ROK forces launched similar continuous attacks. In areas north and northeast of Yanggu and Linji, US and ROK forces bombarded the mountains with intense artillery fire all day long and launched infantry attacks. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who were on strict guard, vigilantly defended their positions and resolutely inflicted serious blows on the invading enemy. A certain unit of the Korean People's Army, firmly defending the Dayusan front northeast of Yanggu, repelled twelve fierce attacks by an enemy regiment on the 8th and 9th, killing or wounding more than 1,100 of them, and bravely repelled several attacks by two enemy battalions on the 10th. Commanders and fighters of the Korean and Chinese People's forces unanimously stated: If the American invading forces dare to violate the desire of the world's people to end the Korean War and launch new offensives after the current frequent attacks, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous losses under the powerful blows of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, until their final defeat.

　　在停战谈判举行之际
　  美李军继续发动频繁攻击
  　中朝人民军痛击进犯之敌
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】本社前线记者报道：正当朝鲜停战谈判会议开始举行的时候，在李奇微、范佛里特相继赴前线亲自部署之下，美国侵略军及李伪军几乎在全线都发动了频繁的攻击。美军第二十四师在本月十一日以两个连兵力攻击华川以北六零二·二和六八二两个高地，受挫后，在十二日以两个营兵力发动第二次攻击，复被击退后又在十三日以一个团兵力发动第三次攻击，直到重又遭受大量伤亡后，才暂时停止攻击。在涟川以西和西北、铁原西北、金化以西等地区，美、李军也都发动了类似这样的连续攻击。在杨口、麟蹄以北和东北地区，美、李军整天用猛烈炮火轰击山地，并展开步兵的攻击活动。严阵以待的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军都警惕地守备着自己的阵地，并坚决予进犯敌军以严重的打击。坚守杨口东北大愚山一线阵地的朝鲜人民军某部，在八、九两日先后击退敌一个团的十二次猛攻，并杀伤其一千一百多名，在十日又英勇地击退了敌军两个营的数次进攻。朝、中人民部队的指挥员和战斗员们一致表示：如果美国侵略军敢于违反世界人民结束朝鲜战争的愿望，而在目前的频繁攻击之后发动新的进攻，那么必将在朝、中人民部队强大打击下，受到更加惨重的损失，直到最后的失败。
