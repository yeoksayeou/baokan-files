Xinhua News Agency, July 28th—In order to implement the "June 1st" call of the China Resist America Aid Korea General Association and the call to "Inspect Preferential Treatment Work" issued in commemoration of the "August 1st" Army Day, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued instructions to democratic women's federations and democratic women's organizations at all levels on the 26th, calling on them to actively participate in the inspection and continue to carry out preferential treatment work. The instructions require democratic women's federations and democratic women's organizations at all levels to pay attention to the following points in inspecting and carrying out preferential treatment work:
　　(1) Conscientiously discuss the People's Daily editorial of July 22nd, "It is Necessary to Do a Good Job in Preferential Treatment Work" and the short commentary of the 11th, "Conscientiously Conduct Inspections of Preferential Treatment Work," so that women cadres can ideologically and politically understand and care about preferential treatment work and assist the government in implementing it. Women cadres should conduct correct propaganda to the masses, especially to women, to strengthen the consciousness and initiative of women in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, and lay the ideological foundation for regular preferential treatment work among the broad masses of women.
　　(2) In inspecting and carrying out preferential treatment work, it is necessary to understand the ideological situation of women and, in light of these situations, strengthen the education of women in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, in conjunction with the political task of resisting America and aiding Korea. At the same time, the understanding and emotions of women in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers should be consolidated in the form of patriotic covenants, so as to implement them in practical actions.
　　(3) When democratic women's federations and democratic women's organizations at all levels carry out the work of giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers, they must decide according to the different situations and conditions of each region. Under the overall plan and unified leadership of various localities, they should formulate their own plans for preferential treatment work and implement them through various means. For example, through urban and rural women's representative meetings and women's representative meetings in various industries, preferential treatment work should be discussed and inspected regularly, and attention should be paid to correcting shortcomings such as formalism or irregularity in the work. When problems are discovered, they should be raised in a timely manner and solutions should be studied.
　　(4) Democratic women's federations and democratic women's organizations at all levels should educate women to make them realize that being a family member of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers is glorious; and pay attention to commending models among family members of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and encourage them to actively participate in production and study. In rural areas, they should be encouraged to participate in mutual aid teams; in urban areas, they should be assisted as much as possible to find employment for family members of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who have the conditions to work. Mobilize women to help each other and reduce the difficulties for family members of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in participating in production and study. Women who have made outstanding achievements in carrying out preferential treatment work should be commended; women who neglect and do not care about preferential treatment work should be given appropriate criticism and education. In order to ensure the regularity of preferential treatment work, women's federations and democratic women's organizations at all levels should conduct regular inspections.

　　全国妇联号召各地妇女团体
　  检查和开展优抚工作
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会为贯彻抗美援朝总会的“六一”号召和为纪念“八一”建军节发布的“检查优抚工作”的号召，于二十六日向各级民主妇联和各民主妇女团体发出指示，号召各级民主妇联和各民主妇女团体积极参加检查与继续开展优抚工作。指示要求各级民主妇联和各民主妇女团体在检查与开展优抚工作中注意以下几点：
    （一）认真讨论人民日报七月二十二日《必须做好优抚工作》的社论和十一日《认真进行优抚工作的检查》的时评，使妇女工作干部从思想上、政治上认识与关心优抚工作，协助政府贯彻实施。妇女工作干部应正确地向群众进行宣传，特别是向妇女群众宣传，以加强妇女群众对拥军优属工作的自觉性和自动性，在广大的妇女群众中打下经常进行优抚工作的思想基础。
    （二）在检查和开展优抚工作中必须了解妇女群众的思想情况，针对这些情况，结合抗美援朝的政治任务，加强对妇女群众的拥军优属教育。同时，要用爱国公约的形式，把妇女群众拥军优属的认识与情绪巩固起来，使之贯彻到实际行动中去。
    （三）各级民主妇联及各民主妇女团体进行优待革命军人家属工作时，必须根据各地区不同情况与条件来决定。应在各地总的计划与统一领导下，订出自己优抚工作的计划，并通过多种多样的方式去贯彻执行。如通过城乡妇女代表会议和各行业的妇女代表会议，经常讨论和检查优抚工作，注意纠正工作中的形式主义或不经常等缺点。发现了问题，应及时提出并研究解决办法。
    （四）各级民主妇联及各民主妇女团体应向妇女群众进行教育，使他们认识作为革命烈士和革命军人的家属是光荣的；并注意表扬革命烈士家属和革命军人家属中的模范，鼓励她们积极参加生产和学习。在农村中，应鼓励她们参加互助组；在城市中，要尽可能帮助有工作条件的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属就业。发动妇女互助，减少革命烈士家属和革命军人家属参加生产和学习的困难。对进行优抚工作有显著成绩的妇女，应加以表扬；对忽视和不关心优抚工作的妇女，应予以适当的批评和教育。为保证优抚工作的经常化，各级妇联及各民主妇女团体应定期进行检查。
