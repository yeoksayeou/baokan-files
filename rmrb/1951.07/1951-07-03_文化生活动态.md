            Shanghai Hospitals Organize Mutual Aid Groups
            To Provide Medical Treatment for Workers with Labor Insurance
    A total of 549 factories in Shanghai have now implemented the Labor Insurance Regulations, covering more than 270,000 employees, along with approximately 1.1 million family members. The original medical equipment and medical personnel of these factories are far from adequate. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, Labor Bureau, Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Medical Workers' Union, have jointly organized 136 public and private hospitals throughout the city into nine mutual aid hospital groups, based on their geographical distribution and equipment situation, with fourteen mutual aid hospital subgroups established under them. Each mutual aid group undertakes the special contracted medical tasks for the factories implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations and also exchanges technology within the group and allocates patients according to equipment availability. Currently, each group has signed special contracts with factories in its respective district and began providing treatment last month. The Municipal Health Bureau and various factories are also strengthening medical equipment.

    上海市现在共有五百四十九家工厂实施了劳动保险条例，包括职工二十七万余人，连同家属约共一百一十万人。各该工厂原有的医疗设备及医务人员都很不够用。上海市人民政府卫生局、劳动局和上海市总工会、市工商联合会、医务工会等，特会同将全市一百三十六家公私立医院，根据其分布地区、设备情形，组织成九个互助医院组，下面设十四个互助医院小组。各互助组分别承担实施劳动保险条例的各工厂的特约诊疗任务，并在组内互相交流技术，按设备调配病人。目前，各组已分别与所在区的工厂签订了特约合同，并于上月起开始诊治。市卫生局及各厂并正在加强医疗设备。
