　　Drawing Lessons from Failure Transforms Failure into Victory
　  ——Comments on Comrade Chen Yougong's Letter

To the Editor:
    I believe that Comrade Chen Yougong's opposition to the People's Daily's criticism of shortcomings in capital construction work is a serious ideological problem. Such understanding is not accidental among comrades currently engaged in or leading capital construction work. Without clarifying such thinking, it will be difficult to rapidly improve our capital construction work. Regarding this issue, I would like to offer two points:
    First, Comrade Chen Yougong's opinion represents the sentiments of some comrades and some enterprise leaders. These comrades believe that since "they are subjectively striving to do a good job in capital construction, and no one wants to see the hard-earned money of the working people wasted," therefore, even if the project fails, it should not be criticized. I believe that this is a completely contrary view to Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in "On Practice" that "Whether truth or theory is truth is not determined by subjective feelings, but by the results of objective social practice." He also said, "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to obtain the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If it does not conform, they will fail in practice. After failure, people will learn from failure, correct their thinking to adapt it to the laws of the external world, and people can transform failure into victory." It cannot be denied that the vast majority of comrades engaged in capital construction subjectively want to do things well for the people. But whether things are done well depends not on subjective wishes, but on the effect of objective practice. If objectively things are messed up and the people's grain is wasted, then it means that the subjective expected effect has not been achieved in objective practice, that there is a problem with our subjective understanding, and that we should examine the causes of failure and accept lessons in order to correct our work. However, some comrades are not checking their subjective wishes based on objective practice, but are detaching themselves from it. These comrades are bound to feel wronged, full of complaints, emphasize objective difficulties, and reject criticism when criticized.
    Second, what is thorough design? Why should thorough design be emphasized in capital construction? The so-called thorough design is not subjective conjecture, but must involve a series of necessary surveying, measuring, investigation, research, testing, geological drilling, and other work, and be based on the information obtained in these works and certain scientific theories. Only after these works have been carried out can people have a correct or roughly correct understanding of a project to be undertaken, can the plans people make be practical or largely practical, and can people avoid or reduce failures in realizing these plans. This is the principle of the relationship between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing, that Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in "On Practice." Some comrades do not pay attention to design work in capital construction, or only verbally acknowledge the importance of this work, but emphasize objective difficulties and do not implement it; this is mainly a problem of ideological understanding rather than anything else. Taking the construction project of the Jinnan Flour Mill as an example, the foundation of its Class B warehouse is mud and water sixty centimeters below the ground, and the foundation of the Class B staff dormitory is mud and water forty centimeters below the ground. Is it difficult to carry out some necessary exploration work on the foundation of the above-mentioned buildings in advance? Obviously, it is not difficult. Comrade Chen Yougong believes that the People's Daily's criticism is "scholars sitting in glass windows" and "not knowing how difficult things are," which is criticizing (or even satirizing) the People's Daily for only talking about empty theories and not contacting reality on this issue. But I believe that it is Comrade Chen Yougong who has not correctly understood the relationship between knowledge and practice as expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong in "On Practice."
    I believe that we have achieved success in our capital construction, and that success is the main aspect. This has long been affirmed. But the existence of many shortcomings is also a fact. The waste caused by these shortcomings is an obstacle to the development of our country's economic construction. In all our work, there are generally achievements and shortcomings. Achievements should be affirmed, and shortcomings and errors should be criticized and corrected. The two must never be confused. Only by constantly exposing and correcting the shortcomings in our work can our work be rapidly improved. Therefore, I believe that the People's Daily's criticism of the shortcomings in capital construction work is not to obliterate achievements, but to consolidate and expand these achievements. The criticisms made by the People's Daily in the past were completely correct and necessary. Such work should continue to be strengthened in the future. Moreover, every patriotic person should regard such work as their natural task.

### 从失败中取得教训就能变失败为胜利  ——对陈有功同志的信的意见

　　从失败中取得教训就能变失败为胜利
　  ——对陈有功同志的信的意见编辑同志：
    我认为，陈有功同志反对人民日报对基本建设工作中的缺点进行批评的意见，是一个严重的思想问题。这样的认识在我们目前从事或领导基本建设工作的同志中还不是偶然存在的。不把这样的思想澄清，就很难把我们的基本建设工作迅速提高。关于这个问题，我愿提出两点意见：
    一、陈有功同志的意见，代表了某些同志及一部分企业领导干部的情绪。这些同志认为：既然“他们在主观上是努力要把基本建设工作作好的，没有一个人愿意眼看着劳动人民的血汗被浪费”，因此，尽管工程遭到了失败，也不应该受到批评。我认为，这是全然违反马克思、列宁主义的观点的。毛泽东同志在实践论中教导我们说：“判定认识或理论之是否真理，不是依主观上觉得如何而定，而是依客观上社会实践的结果如何而定。”又说：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利。”不能否认，绝大多数从事基本建设的同志，主观上是要把事情给人民办好的。但是否把事情办好，不决定于主观愿望，而决定于客观实践的效果。如果客观上把事情弄糟了，浪费了人民的小米，那就是在客观实践中没有达到主观预期的效果，就是我们主观认识上有问题，就应当检讨失败原因，接受教训，以改正工作。可是，有些同志却不是根据而是脱离了客观实践的效果来检查自己的主观愿望。这些同志，在受到批评时，必然是感到委屈，满腹牢骚，并强调客观困难，拒绝批评。
    二、什么是周密的设计呢？为什么在基本建设中要强调周密的设计呢？所谓周密的设计就不是主观的臆想，而是必须进行一系列的必要的查勘、测量、调查、研究、试验、地质钻探等工作，并根据在这些工作中所得的资料和一定的科学理论。只有当进行了这些工作之后，人们才能对于一个待要举办的工程，有正确的或大致正确的认识，人们定出的计划才是切实可行或大体上是切实可行的，人们在实现这些计划中才能避免或减少失败。这就是毛泽东同志在实践论中教导我们的认识和实践的关系、知和行的关系的道理。某些同志不重视基本建设中的设计工作，或仅仅口头上承认这个工作的重要，但强调客观困难，不去执行；这主要的是一个思想认识的问题而不是其他。以晋南面粉厂修建工程而论，其乙种仓库地基在地面六十公分以下即为泥水，乙种职工宿舍地基在地面以下四十公分即为泥水。对于上述建筑物地基事先进行一些必要的探测工作是否有困难呢？显然是不困难的。陈有功同志认为人民日报的批评是“学者坐在玻璃窗内”，“不知事情难办”的议论，是批评（或者甚至是讽刺）人民日报在这个问题上是只讲空洞理论，不接触实际的。但我认为，没有正确地了解了毛泽东同志在实践论中所阐述的认识和实践的关系的恰恰是陈有功同志。
    我认为，我们基本建设中是有成绩的，而且，成绩是主要的。这是早已被肯定了的。但存在着许多缺点，也是事实。由这些缺点所造成的浪费，乃是我国经济建设发展中的障碍。我们的一切工作中一般都是有成绩，也有缺点的，成绩应当被肯定，缺点和错误应受到批评和纠正，绝不能把二者混为一谈。只有在不断地揭发我们工作中的缺点并予以纠正，我们的工作才能迅速提高。因此，我认为，人民日报对基本建设工作中的缺点的批评，并不是抹煞成绩，而是为了巩固和扩大这些成绩。人民日报过去所做的批评完全是正确的和必要的。这样的工作，今后还应继续加强。并且，每一个爱国人民，应把这样的工作视为自己的当然的任务。
