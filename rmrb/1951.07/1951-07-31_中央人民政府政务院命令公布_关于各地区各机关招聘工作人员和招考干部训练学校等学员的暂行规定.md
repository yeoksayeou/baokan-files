The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued an order on July 30th to promulgate the "Interim Provisions on Recruitment of Staff and Enrollment of Cadre Training Schools and Training Class Students by Various Regions and Agencies." The full text is as follows:

According to reports from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, various functional departments of the central and local people's governments, in order to recruit staff and enroll students for cadre training schools and training classes, often hold these activities simultaneously with the regular school entrance examination periods. Furthermore, incidents of drawing or recruiting students from schools and recruiting staff already employed have repeatedly occurred. This not only hinders the state's normal education and construction plans but also seriously affects relationships in various aspects and the work morale of employed staff. To address this, the following temporary provisions are made:

I. During the entrance examination period for universities and secondary schools in a particular region, the functional departments of people's governments at all levels shall generally not conduct recruitment of staff and enrollment of students in that region, unless they have obtained the consent of the local people's government's cultural and educational departments.

II. When recruiting staff and enrolling students, the background of the applicants must be strictly examined. Only unemployed or out-of-school personnel may be admitted; generally, employed or enrolled personnel shall not be admitted.

III. Advertisements for recruitment of staff and enrollment of students, as well as lists of admitted staff or students, must be submitted to the local people's government's personnel departments for review and approval before formal publication or notification.

IV. When various commissions, ministries, associations, academies, departments, banks, and their affiliated units of the Central People's Government recruit staff or enroll students in various regions, they must first consult with and obtain the consent of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, and obtain formal credentials and introductions to be forwarded, and the various regions shall provide assistance.

V. When departments of the People's Government of a Greater Administrative Area recruit staff or enroll students in other regions (for example, the Northeast Region to the East China Region), they must first be reviewed and approved by the personnel departments of their own region, and then reported to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government for review and approval, and obtain formal introduction credentials. Other Greater Administrative Areas should provide assistance; the review and introduction procedures for recruiting staff or enrolling students within their own region shall be handled by the cultural and educational departments and personnel departments of the region.

In addition, the enrollment of higher education institutions not directly under the leadership of education departments at all levels shall be handled in accordance with Article 6 of the "Regulations on the 1951 Summer Enrollment of New Students in Higher Education Institutions" previously issued by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.

　　中央人民政府政务院命令公布
　  关于各地区各机关招聘工作人员和招考干部训练学校等学员的暂行规定
    中央人民政府政务院于七月三十日命令公布《关于各地区各机关招聘工作人员和招考干部训练学校、训练班学员的暂行规定》。全文如下：
    根据中央人民政府教育部和人事部报告，中央和地方人民政府各业务部门为了招聘工作人员和招考干部训练学校、训练班的学员，每于正规学校招考期内同时举行，并已一再发生抽调或招收在校学生和招聘在职工作人员等情事，此不但有碍国家的正常教育建设计划，同时也严重地影响各方面的关系和在职工作人员的工作情绪。为此，暂作如下规定：
    一、在某一地区高等学校、中等学校招考期内，各级人民政府各业务部门除商得当地人民政府文教部门同意者外，一般不得在该地区举行招聘工作人员和招考学员。
    二、招聘工作人员和招考学员时，必须严格审查其来历，只能录取失业或失学的人员；在业或在学的人员，一般不得录取。
    三、招聘工作人员和招考学员的广告，录取工作人员或学员的名单，均须先送经当地人民政府人事部门审查同意后，方得正式公布或通知。
    四、中央人民政府各委、部、会、院、署、行及其附属单位到各地区招聘工作人员或招考学员时，须先商经中央人民政府教育部、人事部同意，并取得正式证件，介绍前往，由各地区予以协助。
    五、大行政区人民政府各部门到其他地区（例如东北区到华东区）招聘工作人员或招考学员，须先经本区人事部门审查同意后再报请中央人民政府教育部、人事部审查，并取得正式介绍证件，其他大行政区应予以协助；至在本区内招聘工作人员或招考学员的审查与介绍手续，由本区文教部门、人事部门负责办理之。
    此外，不属于各级教育部门直接领导的高等学校招生，应遵照中央人民政府教育部前所颁发之《高等学校一九五一年暑期招考新生的规定》第六条办理。
