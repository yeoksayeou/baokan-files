Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th: Shanghai students are enthusiastically signing up for military cadre schools. Shanghai officially began processing applications on July 5th. On the first day, 5,811 students applied. On the morning of the 5th, the application sites of the recommendation committees of major universities and middle schools were crowded with students applying and parents sending their children to apply. On the first day, the number of applicants from many schools had already exceeded the school's planned recruitment quota several times over. Shanghai High School had more than 400 applicants; Xu Hui Middle School, a Catholic school, had more than 90 applicants within half an hour; and McTyeire School had 37 applicants within two hours of the start of registration.
Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 7th: After students in Wuhan schools discussed the Korean armistice talks, the number of students applying to various military cadre schools surged. Most students in each school who met the enrollment requirements applied. Many schools held forums on the Korean armistice talks for teachers, students, and staff. Everyone believed that Ridgway's acceptance of Malik's armistice proposal was the result of the unprecedented strength of the world's peace and democracy camp, especially the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, which dealt a severe blow to the American aggressor troops, and the widespread anti-American and aid-Korea movement of the Chinese people. After the discussion, students in each school had a deeper understanding of the truth that "peace can only be won, not waited for," and thus applied more enthusiastically to various military cadre schools. After the study, the average number of applicants from each school increased by more than 120%. Wuhan No. 1 Middle School originally had more than 300 students applying. After the school held a forum on the Korean armistice talks, the number of applicants increased to more than 590 in two days.
Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: The application process for students from major universities and middle schools in Guangzhou and Xi'an for various military cadre schools has basically ended. The total number of applicants in Guangzhou is more than 5,000. The number of applicants in Xi'an exceeded the recruitment quota by six times. Students in both cities were very enthusiastic about applying as a result of eight months of anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic education. In Guangzhou, more than 500 students from Guangya Middle School applied on July 2nd and 3rd, accounting for more than 80% of the school's students. The number of applicants from Zhixin Girls' Middle School was nearly 70% of the school's students. Li Bi, a student at the school, was forced to return to China from Malaysia this spring, and her parents are still being held in concentration camps by the British colonial authorities in Malaysia. This time, she resolutely applied, wanting to respond to the persecution of imperialism by participating in the cause of consolidating the motherland's national defense. Before and after applying, students in Xi'an listened to the reports from the visiting group to Korea, signed up and studied relevant documents, and their patriotic enthusiasm was high, and they raced to sign up. After hearing the report from the students who participated in the military cadre school last time, more than 30 students from Class B of the second grade of Southeast Middle School immediately signed up to participate in the military communications school. Students who applied but were not approved by various schools all expressed their desire to strive for excellent grades in the semester exams as a congratulatory gift to send off the students participating in the military academy.
This newspaper reports: According to Xinhua News Agency: Students in various places continue to enthusiastically apply to military cadre schools. In Chongqing, in one and a half days on the 1st and 2nd mornings, more than 2,000 students from various schools had applied to military cadre schools. As of the 3rd, more than 1,000 students had applied in the Subei area, and more than 800 in Fujian Province. In Wuhu City, Southern Anhui District, more than 100 students from Cuiwen, Wuguan and other middle schools had applied by the 2nd.
