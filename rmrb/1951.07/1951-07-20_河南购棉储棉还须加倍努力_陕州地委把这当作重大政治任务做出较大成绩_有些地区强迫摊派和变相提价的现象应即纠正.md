Henan Province had purchased and stored 23,470 dan of cotton by July 5th, accounting for just over 31% of the total task for this purchase and storage effort. From July 1st, the daily amount of cotton collected has slightly increased, but the amount collected is still far from the task.

Summarizing the experience of this period, whether the purchase and storage of cotton can be rapidly unfolded depends primarily on whether the leading organs regard this work as a major political task or as a simple purchasing task. Shanzhou Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area of the province, regarded this work as a major political task from the beginning. In early June, the CCP Shanzhou Prefectural Committee sent working groups to cotton-storing villages to conduct typical investigations, organized unified leading bodies for cotton purchase and storage at all levels, and trained cadres and private merchants to enhance their political understanding of cotton purchase and storage. The main responsible cadres of the Chinese Communist Party and government leading organs at all levels personally arranged the work and went to the countryside to supervise and inspect. Therefore, the cotton purchase and storage work in the prefecture quickly took the form of a movement. By July 5th, it had completed more than 54% of the total task.

However, the leading organs in some areas have done the opposite, regarding this task only as a simple purchasing job. The broad masses of Party and government cadres and various mass organizations were not mobilized, nor was good political propaganda conducted among the cotton farmers. This has led to the following undesirable situations. One is that counties such as Xinye have simply handed over the cotton purchase and storage work to the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The Federation of Industry and Commerce then assigned it to businesses in various industries to purchase, and businesses in various industries, not understanding the quality of cotton and disregarding price policies, competed to purchase at various markets, resulting in chaotic cotton flows and rising cotton prices. In Xinye, the price once rose to 14,000 yuan per jin. (This error was corrected by the Commercial Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government in early July.)

The second situation is the phenomenon of apportioning cotton sales that occurred in places like Luyi, Taikang, Shangqiu, and Luoyang. When grassroots cadres saw that the masses were unwilling to sell cotton, they adopted methods such as apportioning by mu, assessing by yield, or "public discussion" to force farmers to hand over cotton. This approach aroused dissatisfaction among the masses and further hindered the work. Many farmers who genuinely had no cotton also rushed to markets everywhere to buy cotton to complete the task, causing chaos in cotton prices. Luyi once saw cotton prices rise to 13,000 or 14,000 yuan because of this, and those who had cotton were even more reluctant to sell, expecting further price increases.

The third situation is the use of bonuses to indirectly raise listed prices, hoping to complete the task with high prices. However, according to the experience of Huaiyang Prefecture, this method can only further fuel the cotton farmers' expectations of rising prices and hinder cotton purchases. The prefecture adopted a price increase method in June and only received 1,366 dan of cotton, a decrease of more than 780 dan compared to the purchase volume in May before the cotton purchase task was issued. Luoyang Prefecture initially believed that as long as a considerable price was offered, and with administrative appeals "supplemented by propaganda," the cotton purchase task could be completed smoothly. No large-scale, in-depth political mobilization was carried out. As a result, not much cotton was collected. Later, seeing that the task could not be completed, they adopted the method of forced apportionment by household, leading to little success in cotton collection in June. The work was rearranged again at the end of June, delaying the movement by a big step.

Since the beginning of July, Party and government leading organs at all levels in the province have paid more attention to the cotton purchase and storage work, strengthened leadership, and the movement is underway. However, the number completed is still far from the original task, and it is necessary to redouble efforts, strengthen vivid and concrete patriotic and worker-peasant alliance propaganda and mobilization work, and other necessary organizational work to complete this political task.

　　河南购棉储棉还须加倍努力
　  陕州地委把这当作重大政治任务做出较大成绩
　  有些地区强迫摊派和变相提价的现象应即纠正
    河南省至七月五日共购棉储棉二万三千四百七十担，占这次购储工作总任务的百分之三十一强。从七月一日起每日收棉量略有增加，但收棉数与任务数相差尚远。
    总结这一段工作的经验，购棉储棉工作能否迅速展开，主要的关键之一，就是领导机关将这一工作当作重大的政治任务看待，还是当做简单的收购任务看待。该省主要产棉区陕州专区，一开始就把这一工作当作一个重大的政治任务看待，中共陕州地委六月初即派工作组赴存棉村作典型调查，并组织了各级的购棉储棉统一领导机构，还集训了干部与私商，提高他们对购棉储棉工作的政治认识。各级中国共产党、政府领导机关主要负责干部均亲自布置工作，并下乡督促检查。因此，该专区的购棉储棉工作很快形成运动。到七月五日止，已完成总任务的百分之五十四强。
    但有些地区的领导机关与此相反，把这一任务只看作一个简单的收购工作，广大党、政干部和各种群众组织没有动员起来，也不对棉农群众很好地进行政治宣传。这就发生了以下各种不好的情况。一种是新野等县，把购棉储棉工作简单地交给商联会去做。商联会又交给各业商家去收购，各业商家既不懂棉花好坏，也不管价格政策，纷纷在各处市场竞购，结果引起棉花乱流，棉价上涨。新野曾一度涨至一万四千元一斤。（这个错误已由河南省人民政府商业厅于七月上旬纠正。）
    第二种情况，是鹿邑、太康、商邱、洛阳等地所发生的摊派售棉现象。基层干部见群众不愿卖出棉花，便采取按亩摊派、按产量评议或“公议”的办法，硬要农民拿出棉花。这种办法激起群众不满，工作更增加了障碍。许多确实无棉的农民为完成任务，也纷纷跑到各地市场买棉，引起棉价混乱。鹿邑即曾因此使棉价涨到一万三、四千元，有棉花的则更加看涨惜售。
    第三种情况，是用奖金办法变相提高牌价，想以高价完成任务。但据淮阳专区经验，这种办法也只能更加助长棉农看涨心理，妨碍购棉。该专区六月份采取提价办法，仅收到棉花一千三百六十六担，比购棉任务下达以前的五月份收购量还减少了七百八十余担。洛阳专区最初也认为只要出相当价钱，通过行政号召，“辅以宣传”，即可顺利完成购棉任务。没有进行大规模的深入的政治动员。结果收不到多的棉花。后来眼看任务不能完成，又采用按户摊派的强迫命令办法，以致六月份收棉成绩很小，六月末又重新布置工作，使运动推迟了一大步。
    七月初旬以来，该省各地党政领导机关对购棉、储棉工作已经更加重视，加强了领导，运动已在开展。但已完成数与原定任务相差尚远，必须加倍努力，加强生动具体的爱国主义的和工农联盟的宣传动员工作和其他必要的组织工作，才能完成这一政治任务。            （傅乃超、靳吾）
