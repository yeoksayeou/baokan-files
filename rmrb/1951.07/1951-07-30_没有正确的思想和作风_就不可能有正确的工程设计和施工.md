Without Correct Thinking and Style
　　There Can Be No Correct Engineering Design and Construction
　　Engineer　Jiao Jinxi

　　Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, considerable achievements have been made in national capital construction. The Huai River diversion project, which the Kuomintang reactionaries had been shouting about for more than 20 years, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, which had been talked about for more than 40 years since the late Qing Dynasty, both started construction and were partially completed within two years of the founding of the People's Government. Other projects, such as the restoration and new construction of industrial and mining enterprises and municipal construction projects in various places, have achieved a higher work efficiency than was possible in the old China before. Take Beijing as an example. It is said that Beijing is importing bricks from other places for the first time since the late Ming Dynasty. The amount of sewers repaired in Beijing this year is more than in many previous years. All this shows that the power is in the hands of the people, and its strength is infinite.
    But on the other hand, there are many shortcomings and errors in our capital construction, and some are relatively serious, causing great losses to the people's property. Many projects do not conform to the three basic principles of economy, solidity, and suitability. Some construction projects are haphazard, resulting in a lot of rework and collapses. This is extremely painful. Our technical workers should bear considerable responsibility for these errors. We cannot allow the people's property to suffer losses for a long time. We should trace the root causes and overcome them.
    I believe that the main reason why many shortcomings occur in engineering design is the ideological awareness of the technical personnel. This can be mainly divided into two aspects:
        (1) Lack of a high degree of responsibility to the people
    Most of the current technical workers have recently joined the revolutionary work. Our political level is generally not high. The idea of wholeheartedly serving the people has not been well established, and we lack a high degree of responsibility to the people. Last year, when I was working on a machine room project, the design drawings required a basement, but we found that the groundwater level was very high, making it difficult to build a basement. We told the designers at the time, but they did not completely change it. When the design drawings were issued, part of the basement was still five meters deep underground. At that time, I thought that since the drawings had been issued, it might take a long time to get a revised drawing if I asked for corrections again, and if the working hours were delayed, it would be "my responsibility". At the same time, I thought: doing it this way would at most be "the people's millet suffering", and it had nothing to do with me. In this way, I started work on a known error with an irresponsible attitude. As a result, nearly 500,000 catties of millet were wasted, and the working hours were delayed by more than three months. For example, the asphalt road made by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau last November had to be repaired and treated again this year. Errors occurred in the sewer project of the Beijing Paper Mill built by the Sanitary Engineering Bureau, the waste in the worker's hospital building project of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and the blind construction of the Andong Smelter, etc. All of these indicate a lack of necessary contact and careful investigation and research between the client, the designer, and the constructor. This perfunctory way of completing the work is an attitude that is not serious and responsible towards the people's cause.
    Take the housing construction projects in Beijing as an example. Some clients still have a supply system mentality and a simple task view of capital construction. Some leading comrades let go of the engineering work, allowing the designers and constructors to do it themselves without participating in research, inspection, and supervision. Some clients are also "fickle" and "indecisive" about the project, often wanting to change the original design when they see a better building. Some designers also have the idea of taking the opportunity to "perform" and create a "masterpiece" instead of persuading the client; or they hold a liberal attitude of "the less said, the better," and compromise. The constructors hold the attitude of "I will do it if the design is good, and it is not my responsibility if it is bad"; or "complete the work to avoid offending people". Some even hold an irresponsible attitude of "anyway, it's not my own money." I was like this when I was in charge of construction last year. Once, when I was doing the painting project of a machine room and the octagonal pavilion project, I knew that doing so was a waste, but I did not patiently persuade the designer and the client, causing considerable losses to the people. These incorrect attitudes are the biggest enemies of our capital construction cause, and we should recognize them and overcome them!
  (2) Lack of a mass perspective
    Due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang and the influence of bourgeois education, most technical workers, except for a few, cannot combine theory and practice well. On the other hand, most of our technical workers come from non-proletarian families and have more or less petty-bourgeois unhealthy thoughts, such as selfishness, arrogance, and self-righteousness. Therefore, most people look down on workers and do not trust the masses. In this way, theory and practice cannot be combined, and the constructors are not good at giving full play to the high enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. In the past, when I was doing construction, my understanding of workers was very vague, thinking that workers were "ignorant". As a result, I became a busy, bureaucratic person all day long. The site management committee was not established in time, and a few people took care of everything, so of course, the work would not be done well, and I still subjectively thought that "I have been working hard enough!" Once, during heavy rain, our cement warehouse was surrounded by water and could not be drained. As a result, the workers volunteered to come up with a way to drain the water. This was a good practical education for me. The recent reports in the newspaper about the collapse of a certain local warehouse and the design errors of the old Wangpo flood storage project in Henan are all lessons learned from the self-righteousness of technical personnel who did not listen to the opinions of the workers.
    If we want to do a good job, we must resolutely implement what Chairman Mao said in "Get Organized!": "Three cobblers put their heads together can make a Zhuge Liang." Ideologically rely on the masses and believe in the masses. Only in this way can we avoid or make fewer mistakes in our work.
    If the above two ideas are resolved, many objective difficulties can be overcome.
    Technical workers, our motherland has begun to carry out capital construction. We should humbly and sincerely arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, constantly improve our political and technical level, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all old ideological consciousness and old styles to meet our glorious and arduous tasks.

### 没有正确的思想和作风  就不可能有正确的工程设计和施工

　　没有正确的思想和作风
　  就不可能有正确的工程设计和施工
    正工程师　焦今昔
    中华人民共和国成立以来，全国的基本建设工作是有相当成绩的。国民党反动派空喊了二十多年的导淮工程和自从清末以来喊了四十多年的成渝铁路工程，都在人民政府成立不到两年的时间内，相继开工并且部分完工了。其他如各地工矿企业的恢复和新建工程以及市政建设工程等，其工作效率之高都是以前旧中国所做不到的。仅就北京来说吧，据说从明朝末年以来北京还是第一次从外埠调砖进来。北京的下水道多少年来还不如这一年来修的多。这统统说明了政权掌握在人民手里，其力量是无穷的。
    但是另一方面，我们的基本建设，也存在着很多缺点和错误，而且有些是比较严重的错误，使人民的财产遭受了很大的损失。很多工程是不符合经济、坚固、合用三基本原则的。有些工程建筑形成乱抓，发生很多返工，倒坍现象。这是令人极其痛心的事。这些错误，我们技术工作者应当担负相当大的责任。我们不能长期让人民财产遭受损失。而应追究根源，加以克服。
    工程设计之所以发生许多缺点，我认为主要原因还是技术人员的思想意识问题。这里主要的可分为两项来说：
        （一）缺乏高度的对人民负责的精神
    现在的大部分技术工作者，都是新参加革命工作的。我们的政治水平一般的都不算高，全心全意为人民服务的思想尚未很好地树立起来，缺乏高度对人民负责的精神。去年我做某机器房工程时，按照设计图样需要做地下室，但我们发现地下水位很高，做地下室很困难。当时也曾向设计者说过，但设计者没有全部改过来。设计图发下时，仍有一部分地下室深达地下五公尺。当时我想图既已发下，如果再要求改正，说不定那一天才能出图，如果耽误了工时，就是“我的责任”了。同时想着：这样做了至多是“人民小米遭殃”，而与自己没什么关系。就这样以不负责任的态度开始了已知错误的工作。结果浪费了小米将近五十万斤，而且耽误了工时三个多月。又如北京市人民政府建设局去年十一月间做的泼油路，到今年便不得不重新补救处理。卫生工程局建筑的北京造纸厂的下水道工程发生了错误，太原钢铁厂工人医院大楼的工程的浪费，安东冶炼厂的盲目施工等，在在都说明——委托者、设计者和施工者之间缺乏必要的联系和慎重的调查研究。这种马马虎虎完工了事的做法，是对人民事业不严肃和不够负责的态度。
    就北京的房屋修建工程来说吧，有些委托者对基本建设还存在着供给制思想和单纯任务观点。有些领导同志对工程是大放手，让设计者和施工者去作，自己不参与研究、检查、督促。还有些委托者对工程“见异思迁”，“主意不定”，常常看到一处较好的建筑，就想改变原来的设计。有些设计者也抱着趁机会“表演一番”来个“杰作”的思想，而不去说服委托者；或者是抱着“少说为佳”的自由主义态度，迁就了事。施工者则抱着“设计好了我就做，坏了不是我的责任”的态度；或者是“完工了事，以免得罪人”。甚至抱着“反正不是花我自己的钱”的不负责任态度。我在去年负责施工时就是如此。有一次我做某机器房的油饰工程和八角亭子工程，当时明知那样做是浪费，但未耐心地说服设计者和委托者，而使人民遭受了不少的损失。这些不正确的态度，都是我们基本建设事业的最大的敌人，我们应当认识它，克服它！
  （二）缺乏群众观点
    由于过去在国民党的长期统治下，并受资产阶级教育的影响，技术工作者，除少数人外，大部分人不能把理论与实际很好地结合起来。另一方面，我们技术工作者，大部分出身于非无产阶级的家庭，或多或少带有些小资产阶级的不良思想，如自私自利、自高自大、自以为是等，因此大多数人看不起工人，不相信群众。这样理论和实际就不能结合，施工者不善于发挥工人群众高度的积极性和创造性。我过去在施工时，对工人认识是很模糊的，以为工人“无知”。结果我自己成了终日忙忙碌碌的事务主义者。现场的管理委员会没有及时地成立起来，大事小事都由几个人包办，这样当然不会把工作搞好，自己还主观地以为“自己够卖力气的了！”有一次下大雨时，我们的洋灰库周围都是水，没法排泄。结果还是工人自告奋勇想出法子才把水排出了。这对我是一个很好的实际教育。最近报载的某地仓窑倒坍，和河南老王坡蓄洪工程设计错误等报道，都是技术人员自以为是不倾听工人意见的教训。
    如果想搞好工作，我们就必须坚决地实行毛主席在“组织起来”中所说的话：“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮。”从思想上依靠群众，相信群众。只有这样，在工作中才能不犯错误或少犯错误。
    上述两种思想如果得到解决，许多客观困难是可以克服的。
    技术工作者们，我们祖国已经开始进行基本建设了，我们应当虚心地真诚地用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，不断地提高我们的政治和技术水平，向一切旧的思想意识，旧的作风作不调和的斗争，来迎接我们光荣的艰巨的任务。
