Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The China Peace Committee held its 6th session on the afternoon of the 4th, to discuss how to further promote the people's resistance against American aggression.

The meeting was attended by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Association, Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen, Ma Yinchu, Shen Yanbing, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Ma Xulun, Cai Chang, Xu Deheng, Peng Zemin, Shao Lizi, Liao Chengzhi, Liang Xi, Hu Qiaomu, Jiang Nanxiang, Standing Committee Members, Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, Mei Ru'ao, Chen Hansheng, members of the World Peace Council, Nie Zhen, Chairman of the North China General Branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, and more than 30 heads of various departments of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea General Association.

After heated discussions, everyone agreed that under the current situation, the people of the whole country should continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, continue to work hard to support the front line, and strive to consolidate national defense. The meeting pointed out that since the General Association issued the call on June 1 for promoting patriotic conventions, donating aircraft and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, these three tasks have made remarkable achievements. In particular, the donation movement has not only encouraged the broad masses of people to donate large quantities of airplanes and artillery on a voluntary basis, but also promoted economic construction and further promoted patriotic education through the donation movement. However, the development of the donation movement is still uneven and not widespread, and the patriotic convention movement and the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers have not been carried out sufficiently. The meeting decided to call on the people of the whole country to make persistent efforts, continue to vigorously carry out the movement to increase production and donations, earnestly give preferential treatment to all the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army soldiers and the families of revolutionary martyrs, continue to mobilize young students to sign up to participate in military cadre schools, complete the enrollment plan of military cadre schools, continue to deeply develop the patriotic convention movement and patriotic propaganda and education, and continue to help the visiting groups to Korea and the returning representatives of the Volunteers to complete the propaganda work in various parts of the country according to the original plan.

　　抗美援朝总会举行常委会议
    讨论继续加强抗美援朝运动
    【新华社五日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会于四日下午举行第六次常务委员会议，讨论在当前形势下如何继续加强全国人民抗美援朝运动的问题。
    出席会议的有该会主席郭沫若，副主席彭真、陈叔通，常务委员马寅初、沈雁冰、罗隆基、黄炎培、马叙伦、蔡畅、许德珩、彭泽民、邵力子、廖承志、梁希、胡乔木、蒋南翔，世界和平理事会理事章伯钧、蔡廷锴、梅汝璈、陈翰笙，华北抗美援朝总分会主席聂真及抗美援朝总会各部门负责人共三十余人。
    经过热烈讨论后，大家一致认为：在目前形势下全国人民应继续加强抗美援朝保家卫国运动，继续努力支援前线，并为巩固国防而奋斗。会议指出：自六月一日总会发出关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待革命烈士家属及革命军人家属的号召以后，这三项工作已经有了显著成绩。特别是捐献运动，广大人民不仅在自觉自愿的基础上踊跃捐献了大批飞机大炮，而且通过捐献运动推动了经济建设，并进一步推进了爱国主义教育。但是，目前捐献运动的发展还不平衡不普遍，爱国公约运动和优待烈属、军属的工作还开展得很不够。会议决定号召全国人民再接再厉，继续努力开展增产捐献运动，认真优待人民志愿军和人民解放军一切军人家属和革命烈士家属，继续动员青年学生报名参加军事干部学校，完成军事干部学校的招生计划，继续深入开展爱国公约运动及爱国主义的宣传教育，继续帮助赴朝慰问团和志愿军归国代表按照原定计划完成在全国各地的宣传工作。
