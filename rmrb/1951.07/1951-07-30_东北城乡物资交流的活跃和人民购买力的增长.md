　　The Active Material Exchange Between Urban and Rural Areas in Northeast China and the Increase in People's Purchasing Power
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Chen Xin
　　State-owned trading organizations in Northeast China have correctly implemented the policy of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to "expand the domestic sales market and activate urban and rural exchanges." On the one hand, they vigorously purchase surplus grain and local products from rural areas; on the other hand, they vigorously meet the people's needs for industrial products; and they lead private merchants to actively participate in purchasing and selling activities. At present, material exchanges between urban and rural areas in Northeast China are becoming smoother, and the purchasing power of urban and rural people is constantly increasing.

　　The Problem of Farmers' Surplus Grain Sales Has Been Solved
　　After relatively systematic investigation and research, state-owned trade has basically accurately grasped the grain output figures for the autumn of 1950, which has provided favorable conditions for planned purchase and sale of farmers' surplus grain. According to the plan, state-owned grain companies actively sell to foreign countries and transport large quantities to Guannei to help the grain supply in the cotton-growing areas and cities of Guannei, finding outlets for the vast majority of surplus grain in Northeast China. Within the Northeast region, more than 50,000 jin of grain were sold on credit to farmers in cash crop areas to pre-purchase cotton and other products, which not only found outlets for grain, but also promoted the increased production of cash crops. From the fourth quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year, state-owned grain companies and cooperatives have purchased nearly two-thirds of the farmers' commercial grain; in the inland market, in addition to selling part of the grain needed to stabilize grain prices, farmers are encouraged to sell it themselves as much as possible. In this way, the problem of farmers' surplus grain sales has been basically solved. (Commercial grain in Northeast China accounts for 45 percent of the purchasing power of Northeast China's farmers, which is a force that deserves attention.) The phenomenon that grain prices in the Northeast market have long been lower than the purchase prices of state-owned trading companies has changed.

　　Local Products Have Also Opened Up a Broad Sales Market
　　Northeast China has a wide variety of local products with abundant yields, which are an important part of urban and rural material exchanges. In order to exchange local products, the Northeast People's Government convened a forum of commercial and economic representatives to discuss local products. Party committees and people's governments at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party also vigorously publicized, implemented, and implemented the correct policy of "expanding the domestic sales market." Through various specialized industry meetings, private commercial joint ventures, joint operations, and joint transportation were organized to sell more with small profits. In terms of industrial and commercial management, the method of dividing industries has been re-formulated, and agents can also operate local products. In terms of taxation, the tax rates on certain commodities have been reduced. In terms of transportation, the railway has revised certain local product grade freight rates. At the same time, the number of quarantine levels has been reduced. The State Bank issued necessary loans. State-owned trading companies took the lead in purchasing and selling local products. With the unification of currency and the expansion of the scope of national local product exchanges, the sales of local products in Northeast China have been opened up, and the local product market has become increasingly active.

　　Taking pork as an example: When the price of pork in Changchun City was 3,578 yuan RMB per jin, an average of 89 pigs were sold per day; when the price was reduced to 3,200 yuan per jin, an average of 136 pigs were sold per day. The average daily profit of each meat merchant increased from 18,244 yuan to 25,770 yuan, an increase of 41 percent. In terms of state tax revenue, although the tax rate on live pigs was reduced by 0.5 percent and the tax rate on each live pig was reduced by 10,000 yuan, the total tax revenue also increased by 30 percent due to the increase in the number of pigs sold, and the tax base was expanded. The sales of eggs have also expanded. For example, in a small town in Heilongjiang Province, the number of egg merchants has increased from 12 to 18. In this way, the sales problem of live pigs and eggs, which account for about 50 percent of the total value of local products in Northeast China, has also been basically solved. The soil alkali in Heilongjiang Province, which has been suffering from no sales for several years, has now found a sales outlet. Ramie and potatoes have also found sales outlets. There is a feeling that there is not enough supply of various seeds and kernels (such as peanuts, sunflower seeds, etc.). There are not many medicinal materials left in Jilin, Taonan and other areas. Apples in western Liaoning and Dalian areas are sold throughout the country, and the price is three times that of last year. This has opened up a broad road for the development of the local product industry in Northeast China.

　　The Industrial Goods Market Is Expanding Day by Day
　　Due to the active rural economy, the increase in the purchasing power of rural people, the increase in the salaries of employees after industrial development, and the influence of the development of material exchanges within Guannei, the sales market for industrial products has also greatly expanded. According to statistics from state-owned trade departments from January to May of this year, the supply of goods needed by urban and rural people was more than five times that of the same period in 1949, an increase of about one time compared with the same period last year. Among them, cotton cloth increased by 70 percent, department stores increased by 75 percent, industrial equipment increased by five times, and coal increased by one-third. The total value of production and living materials supplied to urban and rural people in the first quarter of this year increased by 28.5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year, equivalent to 214.9 percent of the first quarter of last year; the second quarter of this year increased by 32.1 percent compared with the first quarter. What is particularly noteworthy is that among the commodities sold by state-owned trade over the planned amount, fine cloth, colored cloth, sugar, paper, knitwear, rice, flour, soybean oil, and production materials in industrial equipment are the main parts. For example, the sales of fine cloth and colored cloth accounted for 54 percent of the sales of cloth in the first quarter of last year, and 71.7 percent this year. Rehe, which has always been a market for coarse cloth, sells more than 80 percent of fine cloth in its cloth sales. The sales of rice in the first quarter was 228 percent of the same period last year, and 203.9 percent of the same period last year in the second quarter. Flour was 152.8 percent of the same period last year in the first quarter, and 270.1 percent of the same period last year in the second quarter. Soybean oil was 204.6 percent of the same period last year in the first quarter, and 161.7 percent of the same period last year in the second quarter. The total amount of money sold by the Harbin State-owned Trading Company from January to May has reached two-thirds of the total amount of money sold last year. The money sold in the first quarter increased by 1.8 times compared with the same period last year. The months of April and May have reached 80 percent of the first quarter. The Industrial Service Agency sold 100,000 diaries last year, and 300,000 copies were sold in five months this year. The sales of chemical industrial raw materials by the agency this year in five months is equal to four times that of last year. Similar phenomena are too numerous to mention.

　　Private Industry and Commerce Are Also Developing
　　Not only is state-owned trade developing, but private industry and commerce are also developing. In the five cities of Shenyang, Harbin, Jilin, Changchun, and Qiqihar, the amount of money sold by private merchants in April and May reached 81 percent of the three months of the first quarter. The total output value of private iron industry in Benxi City in April was six times that of January. The amount of money reported by Harbin merchants in January was 54 billion; due to the Spring Festival, according to historical customs, January is the month with the highest transaction volume in the whole year; however, the total amount of money sold by merchants in the city in March increased to 55.7 billion, which is even more than in January. One agent had a transaction volume of 300 million in February, 600 million in March, 800 million in April, and 1.3 billion in May; this shows the activity of traveling merchants. One tea merchant has transaction relations with more than ten surrounding counties, remitting money and goods back and forth, and there is no "off-season" for the fresh and dried vegetables and fish and meat industry.

　　New Situations, New Problems
　　The active material exchange between urban and rural areas reflects the superiority of the new democratic social system. Production has been rapidly developed, the people's living standards have been continuously improved, the people's demand for the variety of goods has increased, the quantity has increased, the quality has also improved, and the cultural and health requirements have also improved. This is the result of production development and increased people's income. For example, the highest salary for technicians in the Shenyang Rubber Fourth Factory last year was 196 points, and it has now been increased to 310 points. The salary of the Liu Jinggao Model Group increased by 28.33 percent from February to April this year. Chen Cang, a technician in the factory, had a salary of less than 90 points when Northeast China was first liberated, but now it has reached 270 points. It is no longer a novelty for a family of five to eat rice regularly, and they bought a bicycle for the convenience of going to work. According to a survey of a residential area in a police station in Anshan City, 50 percent of the residents eat fine grains every day, 25 percent of the residents eat half coarse and half fine grains, and the remaining 25 percent of the residents eat good food once a week. The Benxi Department Store used to sell more than 1,000 to 2,000 yuan of soap, but this year it sells more than 5,000 yuan of scented soap; last year, Shanghai-made 6,000 to 7,000 yuan towels were not easy to sell, but they were sold out this year. Some employees want "gabardine" and feel that green fine cloth and blue twill are not enough. The output of aquatic product areas in western Liaoning and Dalian has doubled compared with last year, and the price has increased to three times. A survey of several villages in the cotton area of western Liaoning shows that 30 percent of cotton farmers want to repair or build new houses, and many of them are stone-based brick walls. In the cotton area of ​​Beipiao, Rehe, 16 percent of cotton farmers have cars and horses and still have surplus grain to sell.

　　In short, the purchasing power of urban and rural people is growing rapidly. This development speed (not the total value) is faster in cities than in rural areas, faster in cash crop areas than in grain-producing areas, faster in local products than in grain, and faster in department stores than in other (grain, coal). It is not difficult to predict that the second half of this year will be much higher than the first half. According to the development trend in the past six months, it is estimated that the purchasing power of the people in Northeast China will increase by more than 40 percent in the second half of the year compared with the first half. In particular, a widespread patriotic production competition has been launched in the vast rural areas, and the Party and the government have vigorously organized and led the expansion of the production of commercial grain and technical crops. This new situation has raised new problems for state-owned trade in Northeast China: how to further strengthen and expand state-owned trade, give full play to its leading role, further combine various economic forces, continue to expand and accelerate the circulation of commodities, so as to promote and expand the reproduction of commodities. Specifically, it is necessary to strengthen the research work on commodities and people's purchasing power, understand the current situation and potential capacity of state-owned, cooperative, and private industries, expand the control of industrial products; plan to organize processing and production, actively carry out off-site procurement and ordering, expand the source of commodities; and improve commodity circulation work, establish wholesale stations adapted to economic zoning, and mobilize the masses to run grassroots stores well. It is also necessary to improve the leading role of state-owned trade, further organize the cooperative and private economic forces, and further activate the economic life of urban and rural people.

　　东北城乡物资交流的活跃和人民购买力的增长
    本报特约记者　陈新
    东北地区国营贸易机关正确地贯彻执行了中央人民政府贸易部“扩大内销市场、活跃城乡交流”的方针，一方面大力向农村采购余粮、土产，一方面大力满足人民对于工业品的需要；并领导私商积极参加购、销活动。现在东北城乡物资交流日趋顺畅，城乡人民购买力不断提高。
  农民余粮销路问题得到解决
    经过比较有系统的调查研究，国营贸易基本上准确地掌握了一九五○年秋季的粮食产量数字，这就给有计划地购销农民余粮提供了有利条件。根据计划，国营粮食公司积极向国外出售，并大量运入关内，帮助关内植棉区与城市的粮食供应，给东北绝大部分的余粮找到了销路。在东北区内，又以五万余斤粮食向经济作物区农民赊卖，以此预购棉花等产品。既为粮食找到了销路，又促进了经济作物的增产。从去年第四季度到今年第二季度，国营粮食公司及合作社收购农民商品粮食已近三分之二；在内地市场上，除平稳粮价需要出售部分粮食外，其余尽量鼓励农民自售。这样，使农民余粮的销路问题基本上得到解决。（东北商品粮食占东北农民购买力的百分之四十五，是一个值得重视的力量。）东北市场粮价长期低于国营贸易公司购粮牌价的现象，已经改变。
  土产也打开了广阔的销路
    东北土产品种繁多，产量丰富，是城乡物资交流的重要部分。为了交流土产，东北人民政府曾召开各种商业经济代表参加的土产座谈会，中共各级党委和人民政府也大力宣传、贯彻、实施了“扩大内销市场”的正确方针，通过各种专门行业会议，组织了私人商业联营、合营、联运，薄利多销。在工商管理上，重新制订了行业划分办法，代理店也可以经营土产。在税收上，减低了某些商品的税率。运输方面，铁路修正了某些土产等级运价率。同时，并减少了检疫层次。国家银行发放了必要的贷款。国营贸易公司在购销土产上带头示范。加上货币统一，全国土产交流范围扩大，东北的土产销路打开了，土产市场日渐活跃了。
    以猪肉为例：长春市每斤肉价人民币三千五百七十八元时，每日平均销八十九口；每斤降低到三千二百元时，每日平均销一百三十六口。平均每日每户肉商的利润，由一万八千二百四十四元上升到二万五千七百七十元，增加了百分之四十一。国家税收方面，虽然减免了千分之五的毛猪税率，每口活猪税率减低了一万元，但由于销猪数量增加，税收总数也增加了百分之三十，还扩大了税源。鸡蛋也扩大了销路。如黑龙江省一个小城镇，鸡蛋商原为十二家，现已增至十八家。这样，占整个东北土产总值约百分之五十的活猪、鸡蛋的销路问题也基本上解决了。黑龙江省的土碱，几年来苦无销路，现在也已找到销路了。线麻、土豆都有了销路。各种籽仁（如花生、葵花籽等）已经感到供不应求。吉林、洮南一带的药材也已剩余不多。辽西、旅大地区的苹果行销全国，价格等于去年的三倍。这就给东北土产事业的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
  工业品市场一天天扩大
    由于农村经济的活跃，农村人民购买力的提高，和工业发展后职工薪资的增加，以及关内物资交流发展的影响，工业品的销售市场也大大扩展了。国营贸易部门今年一月份至五月份统计：供应城乡人民商品需要为一九四九年同期的五倍多。比去年同期扩大约一倍。其中纱布增加百分之七十，百货增加百分之七十五，工业器材增加五倍，煤炭增加三分之一。今年第一季度供应城乡人民生产和生活资料的总值，和去年第四季度相较增加了百分之二十八点五，等于去年第一季度的百分之二百一十四点九；今年第二季度又比第一季度增加了百分之三十二点一。特别值得注意的，是在国营贸易超计划销售的商品中，以细布、色布、砂糖、纸张、针织品、大米、面粉、豆油以及工业器材中的生产资料为主要部分。如去年第一季度销售的细布、色布占销布数百分之五十四，今年则占百分之七十一点七。向来是粗布市场的热河，销出细布占销布数百分之八十以上。第一季度销售大米，为去年同时期的百分之二百二十八，第二季度为去年同时期的百分之二百零三点九。面粉第一季度为去年同时期的百分之一百五十二点八，第二季度为去年同时期的百分之二百七十点一。豆油第一季度为去年同时期的二百零四点六，第二季度为去年同时期的百分之一百六十一点七。哈尔滨国营贸易公司一月至五月的卖钱总额已达去年全年卖钱总额的三分之二。第一季度卖钱比去年同期扩大一点八倍。四、五两月份已达第一季度的百分之八十。工业服务社代销日记本去年为十万本，今年五个月即达三十万本。代销化学工业原料今年五个月等于去年的四倍。类似现象，不胜枚举。
  私营工商业也在发展
    不仅国营贸易在发展，私人工商业也在发展。沈阳、哈尔滨、吉林、长春、齐齐哈尔五个城市，四、五两月份私商卖钱额达第一季度三个月的百分之八十一。本溪市私营铁工业四月份生产总值比一月份扩大六倍。哈尔滨座商自报卖钱额一月份为五百四十亿；因春节关系，按历史习惯，一月份是全年交易额最高的月份；但该市座商三月份卖钱总额又增至五百五十七亿，比一月份还多。有一家代理店，交易额二月份为三亿，三月份六亿，四月份八亿，五月份增至十三亿；这可以看出行商的活跃。一家茶商与周围十余县发生交易关系，汇钱来，汇货去，干鲜蔬菜和鱼肉业等已无“淡季”。
  新情况，新问题
    城乡物资交流的活跃，反映了新民主主义社会制度的优越性。生产得到迅速发展，人民生活水平日益提高，人民对需要的商品品种加多了，数量增大了，质量也提高了，文化与卫生要求也提高了。这是生产发展、人民收入增加的结果。如沈阳橡胶四厂去年技术工人最高工薪是一九六分，现已提到三一○分。刘景高模范小组从今年二月到四月间，工薪提高了百分之二十八点三三。该厂技术工人陈仓在东北初解放时工资不足九十分，现在已达二百七十分。五口之家平时吃大米已经不是什么新奇事儿了，为了上班方便，又买了一辆脚踏车。据鞍山市派出所一个住宅区的调查，百分之五十的居民每日吃细粮，百分之二十五的居民半粗半细，其余百分之二十五的居民每星期吃一次好的。本溪市百货公司过去多销一千至二千元肥皂，今年则多销五千元香皂；去年上海造六七千元毛巾不好卖，今年卖光了。部分职工愿要“花达呢”，感到青细布、蓝斜纹还不满足。辽西、旅大水产区产量比去年扩大一倍，价格增长至三倍。辽西棉区几个村调查：有百分之三十棉农要修或盖新房子，而且不少是石基砖墙。热河北票一带棉区百分之十六棉农有车有马，尚有余粮要求出售。
    总之城乡人民购买力在迅速增长，这种发展速度（不是总值）城市比乡村快，经济作物区比产粮区快，土产比粮食快，百货比其它（粮、煤）快。不难预料，今年下半年将比上半年提高很多。按半年来的发展趋势估计，下半年东北人民购买力将比上半年提高百分之四十以上。特别是广大农村普遍展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，党和政府大力组织领导了扩大商品粮食和技术作物的生产。这种新的情况给东北国营贸易提出了新的问题：如何进一步加强与扩大国营贸易，发挥其领导作用，进一步结合各种经济力量，继续扩大与加速商品的流转，以促进并扩大商品的再生产。具体地说，就是要加强对商品和人民购买力的研究工作，了解国营、合作社以及私营工业的生产现状和潜在能力，扩大掌握工业品；有计划地组织加工生产，积极进行区外采购和订货，扩大商品来源；并改进商品流转工作，建立适应经济区划的批发站，发动群众办好基层商店。还要提高国营贸易的领导作用，把合作社和私营经济力量进一步组织起来，进一步活跃城乡人民的经济生活。
