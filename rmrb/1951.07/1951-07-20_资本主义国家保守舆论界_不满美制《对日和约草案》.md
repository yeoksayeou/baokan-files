Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The U.S.-unilaterally drafted "Treaty of Peace with Japan," published on the 12th, has aroused dissatisfaction even among conservative public opinion circles in capitalist countries. The British Conservative Party's *Daily Sketch* said, "The United States is the guiding nation behind the treaty." The Conservative Party's *Yorkshire Post* also believed, "The treaty has strong American characteristics."

The leader of the Australian opposition party—the Labor Party—Evatt, said on the 12th regarding the American draft: Australian "people from all parties and factions, and the Australian people, view the planned rearmament of Japan with the deepest anxiety and resentment. Those familiar with Japanese behavior understand that the group of people and Zaibatsu, as well as arms monopolists, who originally controlled the Japanese army will soon return to power." He criticized the United States for abandoning the international agreement prohibiting Japan's rearmament for the sake of "temporary convenience." He said: The American draft does not conform to the interests of Australia and New Zealand, it is a "treaty of appeasement towards Japan with ironic implications."

Some newspapers in the Philippines also published editorials that "violently attacked" the American draft. *The Manila Chronicle* said: This draft will "give the defeated enemy the rights and privileges of the victorious country."

　　不满美制《对日和约草案》
    【新华社十九日讯】十二日发表的美国片面制订的《对日和约草案》，甚至在资本主义国家的保守舆论界中，也引起了不满。英国保守党的《每日写真报》说：“美国是和约背后的指导国家”。保守党的《约克郡邮报》也认为：“和约具有强烈的美国特征”。
    澳大利亚在野党——工党的领袖伊瓦特在十二日论美国的草案说：澳大利亚“各党各派的人士和澳大利亚人民，都怀着最深切的不安和忿恨的情绪来看计划中的日本重新武装。熟悉日本行径的人都了解：原来控制着日本军队的一帮人和财阀以及军火独占资本家，不久就要重新上台了”。他抨击美国为了“一时的方便”而背弃禁止日本再武装的国际协议。他说：美国的草案并不符合澳大利亚和新西兰的利益，它是“带有讽刺意味的对日姑息条约”。
    菲律宾的一部分报纸亦发表社论《猛烈攻击》美国的草案。《马尼拉纪事报》说：这一草案将“给战败的敌人以战胜国的权利与特权”。
