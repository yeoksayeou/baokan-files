Resolutely Relying on the Working Masses to Implement the "Inside Wage System" is a Good Way to Eliminate the Headman's Feudal Exploitation in the Construction Industry
    Gan Chi
    A construction office of a certain Beijing government agency has implemented the inside wage system, paying workers on a daily basis, from the very beginning of recruiting workers. Two years of experience have proven that implementing the inside wage system, under the current circumstances, is a good way to fundamentally abolish the feudal headman exploitation system in the construction industry.
    The inside wage system is in contrast to the contracting system. It is where the enterprise administration directly hires and manages workers, organizes construction, and directly pays wages to workers. This makes it impossible for the headman system to exist, and even disguised exploitation is difficult to carry out. When the construction office initially implemented this system, it encountered some ideological resistance. Some cadres, especially those directly responsible for construction, believed that if this were the case, no one would manage the workers, and there would be "dragging on the job," waste of labor and materials, and low efficiency, etc. At the same time, they also believed that directly managing workers was too troublesome, and it would be better to contract it out, with themselves only supervising the technology.
    The administrative leaders conducted a serious struggle against the above two incorrect viewpoints. First, they pointed out that fearing that workers would "drag on the job" after implementing the inside wage system was an incorrect idea of not relying on and not trusting the workers; and explained that after abolishing the headman's feudal exploitation, as long as class education for the workers is strengthened, the workers would quickly carry out production with a new labor attitude as masters of their own affairs. Facts quickly proved this point. After implementing the inside wage system and abolishing the headman system, in less than three or four months, five or six workers refused bribes from unscrupulous merchants and exposed the illegal acts of unscrupulous merchants. Worker Zhou Songquan discovered that coal merchants were cheating when weighing coal. The unscrupulous merchant bribed him with money, but he refused and immediately reported the matter to the supervising engineer, reducing the construction office's loss of several tons of coal. The phenomenon of "dragging on the job" also no longer existed, and the labor efficiency of the workers was greatly improved compared to before. For example, for wall foundation deep masonry (that is, masonry below ground level and above the foundation), when the inside wage system was first implemented, one cubic meter required three workers (two small and one large), but two months later it only required 2.2 workers. Another example is ramming lime soil. At the end of 1949, one square meter required 1.1 workers, but by the spring of 1950, it only required 0.9 workers.
    At the same time, the leading cadres also criticized the erroneous view of some cadres who were afraid of trouble and wanted to save trouble. The trade union cooperated with the administrative side to carry out education, pointing out that abolishing the headman contracting system and implementing the inside wage system was a huge reform movement in the construction industry. In any work, there will be trouble when reforms are carried out. Revolutionary workers must not be afraid of trouble. Implementing the inside wage system is naturally somewhat troublesome. For example, the administrative side and the trade union must assist in solving the workers' food and accommodation problems, and the workers' work calculation and leave applications must also have a certain system and be handled by dedicated personnel. The construction office administratively formulated the necessary systems in a timely manner and assigned cadres to help manage food and build worker sheds (dormitories), etc. The trade union stepped up systematic class education for the workers, educated the workers to consciously implement the system, and paid attention to cultivating worker cadres. Gradually, some problems could be solved by the workers themselves.
    After implementing the inside wage system, it is still necessary to not relax anti-headman education for workers and transformation education for headmen.
    Although the headman was abolished in the system after the implementation of the inside wage system, if the workers are not given anti-headman education to draw a clear line between them and the headman in their minds, the former headman will continue to carry out disguised exploitation of the workers in secret. Woodworking team leader Li Yunshu (formerly a headman) used the shortcomings of some workers' low level of awareness to deduct the fractions of their wages (ranging from three to five thousand yuan) each time wages were paid, exploiting two to three hundred thousand yuan within one or two months. After this phenomenon was exposed by the workers, the trade union immediately organized an anti-headman accusation meeting of more than one thousand workers. Through the workers' accusations, the workers' class consciousness was raised; at the same time, the former contractors were also educated, blocking the loopholes for the old headmen to carry out disguised exploitation.
    Most of the contractors in the construction industry have gone from being apprentices to workers, and then from workers to headmen. Most of their skills are very good. For these old contractors, two points must be paid attention to: For those with skills, their wages should be determined according to their skills in accordance with the principle of distribution according to work. They cannot be denied higher wages because they have exploited people and are politically backward. Otherwise, they will not be united, and there will be no way to transform them, and their technical role cannot be fully brought into play. In addition, they must be resolutely reformed ideologically. Most of these old headmen participate in work because it is "the general trend and they have no choice." For example, some former headmen in the construction office saw that the construction office was no longer willing to contract out work, so they had to come to work, because there was no other way out, rather than a real change in their thinking. Although some of them have settled down to work after participating in work, their old ideological style still exists. Relying on the supervision of the masses and transforming them through various mass activities is the most effective way to transform them. For example, group meetings, self-criticism meetings, wage evaluation meetings, and model selection campaigns are all good occasions to educate them. The construction office has taken these necessary measures, which have enabled the contractors to be initially transformed, their skills have been brought into play, and their enthusiasm for production has also been improved.
    Naturally, the most in line with the principle of distribution according to work, and the most able to stimulate workers' enthusiasm for production and creativity, is still the piece-rate wage system. The construction office once tried out the collective piece-rate wage system in certain work areas. The results proved that the following two conditions must be met to implement the collective piece-rate system, otherwise it will have the opposite effect.
    First, workers must have a relatively sound organization and a relatively high level of awareness. A certain work area temporarily hired eighteen workers from outside due to busy work. They were unwilling to implement the inside wage system and wanted to implement the collective piece-rate system (actually a small contracting system). The administration collectively contracted out a part of the pointing work to them. After the work was completed, in addition to the wages that each person should receive, there was a surplus of more than two million yuan in the total wages. The administration was afraid that the headman would be up to no good, so it distributed the money to everyone in person according to their technical level. However, after these workers left the construction office, they each took out one or two thousand yuan and gave it to the headman Xue Lianqi. As a result, Xue's income accounted for 20% of the remaining wages. This situation shows that in the case of insufficient organization and low awareness of workers, the collective piece-rate wage system is easily used by the headman to carry out disguised exploitation.
    Second, there must be a more reasonable technical quota and inspection and acceptance system. When a certain work area of the construction office was laying cement bricks, it was a collective contract. At that time, it was estimated that 250 pieces would be laid per three workers (one large worker and two small workers). As a result, the same workers did 500 pieces. In this way, the wage income increased by one time, and some were as high as 1.65 times. Under normal circumstances, under the same technical conditions, with the labor organization unchanged and the operation method unchanged, it is difficult to increase efficiency by 165%. This means that there is a high probability that there is a problem with the original quota, or there is a phenomenon of cutting corners. In the plastering project of the other two work areas, a collective piece-rate wage was implemented. Because there was no sound inspection and acceptance system, the top fell off soon after the workers handed over the work due to shoddy workmanship. Under the current circumstances, the construction industry is still a handicraft industry, not mechanized, so it is more difficult to formulate reasonable quotas. Because the same project will use different labor and materials in different seasons, environments, or different project stages. For example, for earthwork excavation, the efficiency can vary by one time in different soil environments. The acceptance of construction projects is also not easy.
    In principle, although the piece-rate wage is the most scientific and reasonable, most of the construction industry currently lacks the aforementioned two conditions. The implementation of the piece-rate wage system is prone to be used by the headman for exploitation, or to cut corners and reduce materials, affecting the quality of the building. Judging from the experience gained by the construction office in the past two years, under the current conditions, the inside wage system paid on a daily basis is the most beneficial to production and workers.

　　坚决依靠工人群众实行“里工资制”是修建业取消把头封建剥削的好办法
    甘池
    北京某机关修建办事处从开始招收工人时起，就实行了按日付资的里工资制。两年来的经验证明，实行里工资制在目前情况下，是建筑业从根本上废除封建把头剥削制度的好办法。
    里工资制是对包工制而言。它是由企业行政方面直接雇佣与管理工人，组织施工，直接向工人支付工资。这样就使得把头制度无法存在，连变相的剥削也很难进行。在该修建办事处开始执行这种制度时，曾经遇到了一些思想抵抗。有些干部，特别是直接负责施工的干部们，认为这样一来工人没人管理了，就会发生“磨洋工”、费工费料、效率不高等等毛病。同时，还认为直接管理工人太麻烦，不如包出去，自己只在技术上监工就可以了。
    行政领导干部对以上两种不正确的观点进行了严肃的斗争。首先，指出怕实行里工资制以后工人会“磨洋工”是不依靠工人不相信工人的错误思想；并说明废除了把头的封建剥削后，只要加强对工人的阶级教育，工人很快就会以主人翁的新的劳动态度来进行生产。事实很快就证明了这一点。实行了里工资制，取消了把头制后，不到三、四个月的时间，就有五、六个工人拒绝奸商的贿赂，揭发了奸商捣鬼的不法行为。工人周松泉发现煤商秤煤时捣鬼，奸商以金钱贿赂他，但他拒绝了，并且立即将此事报告了主管工程师，使该修建办事处减少了数吨煤的损失。“磨洋工”的现象也不存在了，工人的劳动效率较前有了很大的提高。比如墙下埋深砌墙（即在地平以下地基以上砌墙），在初实行里工资制时，一立方公尺须要三个工（二小一大），两个月后就只要二点二工。又如打灰土，一九四九年底，一平方公尺须一点一工，到一九五○年春就只要零点九工了。
    同时，领导干部对有些干部怕麻烦图省事的错误观点也进行了批判。工会配合行政方面进行教育，指出取消把头包工制，实行里工资制，是建筑业的一个巨大的改革运动。在任何一件工作中，要进行改革，不会没有麻烦的。作为革命工作者就不能怕麻烦。实行里工资制自然是有些麻烦的，比如工人的食宿问题要行政方面和工会来协助解决，工人的计工请假等也须要有一定的制度和专人负责。该修建办事处行政上及时制定了必要的制度，并指派干部帮助管理伙食，为工人修工棚（宿舍）等。工会加紧对工人进行系统的阶级教育，教育工人自觉地执行制度，并注意培养工人干部。渐渐地，有些问题工人自己就能够解决了。
    实行里工资制后还不能放松对工人进行反把头的教育和对把头们进行改造教育。
    实行了里工资制，虽然从制度上取消了把头，但是若不对工人进行反把头的教育，使工人在思想上和把头划清界限，过去的把头就会暗中对工人继续进行变相的剥削。木工组组长李云书（过去是把头）就利用某些工人觉悟程度不高的缺点，在每次发工资时克扣他们工资的尾数（三、五千元不等），一两个月内就剥削了二、三十万元。这种现象被工人揭发后，工会立即组织了一千余工人的反把头控诉大会。通过工人的控诉，提高了工人的阶级觉悟；同时也教育了过去的包工头，堵死了旧把头进行变相剥削的空子。
    修建业中的包工头大多是从学徒熬到工人、从工人又熬到把头的，他们的技术大多数是很好的。对这些旧的包工头，必须注意两点：对有技术的，应该依照按劳取酬的原则，根据他们的技术确定他们的工资。不能因为他们曾剥削过人、政治上落后而不肯给以较高的工资。否则，团结不了他们，也就谈不到改造他们，同时也不能充分发挥他们在技术上的作用。另外，对他们必须坚决地进行思想上的改造。这些旧把头参加做工大都是“大势所趋，不得不然”，如该修建办事处有些过去的把头，看到该修建办事处不肯再包工了，只好也来做工，因为不如此就没出路，而不是真正从思想上有所转变。有的参加做工后虽也安心工作了，但旧的思想作风还存在着。依靠群众的监督，通过各种群众活动来改造他们，是改造他们的最有效的办法。比如小组会、检讨会、评工资会、评选模范运动等，都是教育他们的好场合。该修建办事处采取了这些必要的措施，已使包工头们得到初步的改造，他们的技术得以发挥，生产积极性也有所提高。
    自然，最合乎按劳取酬的原则，最能激发工人的生产积极性和创造性的还是计件工资制。该修建办事处曾经在某些工区试行了集体计件工资制。结果证明，要实行集体计件制必须具备以下两个条件，否则就会发生相反的作用。
    一、工人必须有较健全的组织和较高的觉悟程度。某工区因工作忙曾从外面临时雇佣了十八个工人。他们不愿意实行里工资制而要实行集体计件制（实际上就是小包工）。行政上将一部分勾缝工作集体包给他们。工作结束后，总的工资中除每人应领工资外，还余下二百多万元。行政方面怕有把头捣鬼，就当面按技术程度把钱分给大家。但是这些工人离开该修建办事处后却又每人抽出一两万交给把头薛连起。结果薛一人所得占所余工资的百分之二十。这一情况说明，在工人的组织不够健全，觉悟程度不高的情况下，集体计件工资制很容易为把头所利用，进行变相的剥削。
    二、必须有较合理的技术定额和检查验收制度。该修建办事处某工区铺洋灰砖时是集体包工。当时估计是每三工（一大工二小工）铺二百五十块。结果同样的工人做到了五百块。这样，工资所得就提高了一倍，还有的多到一点六五倍。在一般情况下，同等的技术条件下，劳动组织不变，操作方法不变，效率很难提高到百分之一百六十五。这就是说，有很大的可能是原来的定额有问题，或者是有偷工现象。在另外两个工区抹灰工程中实行了集体计件工资，因没有健全的检查验收制度，由于工人偷工，交工不久就落顶了。在目前情况下，建筑业还是手工业方式，不是机械化的，因而制定合理的定额是比较困难的。因为同样的工程，在不同的季节、环境或不同的工程阶段所用人工与材料就会不一样。比如土工刨方，在不同的土质环境下，效率能相差一倍。建筑工程的验收也是不太容易的。
    在原则上计件工资虽然是最科学合理的，但目前大多数建筑业还缺少前述两个条件，实行计件工资制反容易为把头利用进行剥削，或偷工减料影响建筑物的质量。就该修建办事处二年来所摸索到的经验看，在目前的条件下，对于生产、对于工人最有利的还是按日计资的里工资制。
