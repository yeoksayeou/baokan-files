　　Xinhua News Agency, Vienna: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions discussed the second item on the agenda, "The World Federation of Trade Unions' Struggle to Defend Peace and Oppose the Rearmament of West Germany and Japan," and the third item on the agenda, "Work Reports of the Miners' Trade Unions International and the Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International" on the 4th and 5th.

　　World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant made a report on the World Federation of Trade Unions' struggle for peace on the 4th. He said that since the beginning of the world peace movement, the World Federation of Trade Unions has concentrated its efforts on mobilizing the working class to become the core of the broad peace movement. Because, without the active participation of a united working class in the struggle for peace, the peace movement would not have a solid foundation. Saillant reported in detail on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in consolidating peace, and emphasized that the task of this session of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau is to formulate measures to strengthen the struggle for peace and oppose the rearmament of West Germany and Japan.

　　Vainke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, made a report on "The World Federation of Trade Unions and the Struggle Against the Rearmament of West Germany." Vainke said: Due to the policy pursued by American monopoly capitalists, German imperialism is rapidly reviving and has become the vanguard of the warmongers against the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic. Vainke discussed the struggle waged by progressive forces in Europe and Germany against the rearmament of West Germany. He focused on the work and decisions of the European workers' delegates to the conference against the rearmament of West Germany and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951, and pointed out that the results of the German people's vote have powerfully demonstrated the German people's will for peace and unity. Vainke concluded by pointing out that it is necessary to unite the working people of all Germany to carry out the struggle for the national interests of the German people, and to carry out the struggle for friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, because these countries all advocate German unity.

　　Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, made a report on the struggle against the US rearmament of Japan.

　　On the 5th, Dulier, Secretary of the Miners' Trade Unions International, made a work report on the Miners' Trade Unions International, describing the miners' struggle to improve their living standards, fight for peace, and oppose the preparation of a new war. He described the miners' strikes in France, Italy, Britain, West Germany, the United States, North Africa, and other countries, whose slogans were: "Do not produce an inch of fuel or an inch of mine seedlings for the imperialist war." Bursky, General Secretary of the Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International, reported that since its establishment two years ago, the Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International has been joined by twenty-four trade unions from nineteen countries, with a total membership of 4,362,317 people. Bursky then reported that in the United States, Italy, France, and other countries, due to the rise in the prices of necessities and the increase in taxes, the wave of strikes by textile and garment workers is expanding.

    世界工联总书记赛扬四日作了关于世界工联争取和平斗争的报告。他说，自从世界和平运动开始以来，世界工联即集中全力来动员工人阶级，使他们成为广大的和平运动的核心。因为，如果在争取和平的斗争中没有统一的工人阶级积极参加，和平运动便没有巩固的基础。赛扬详尽地报告了世界工联在巩固和平方面的活动，并着重指出世界工联执行局本届会议的任务是制订加强和平斗争、反对重新武装西德和日本的措施。
    自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克作了《世界工联和反对重新武装西德的斗争》的报告。瓦恩克说：由于美国垄断资本家所奉行的政策，德国帝国主义正在迅速地复活着，变成了战争贩子反对苏联、人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的前锋。瓦恩克论述了欧洲和德国进步力量所进行的反对重新武装西德的斗争。他着重说明了欧洲工人反对重新武装西德及争取一九五一年缔结对德和约代表大会的工作和决定，并且指出德国人民投票的结果已有力地表明德国人民要求和平与统一的意志。瓦恩克最后指出：必须团结全德国劳动人民进行争取德国人民的民族利益的斗争，进行争取与苏联和人民民主国家友好的斗争，因为这些国家都是主张德国统一的。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一作了关于反对美国重新武装日本的斗争的报告。
    五日，矿工工会国际书记杜列尔作了矿工工会国际的工作报告，叙述了矿工为争取提高生活水平、争取和平与反对准备新战争而斗争的情况。他叙述了法、意、英、西德、美国、北非及其他国家中矿工罢工的情况，他们罢工的口号是：“不给帝国主义战争生产一公分燃料，一公分矿苗。”纺织缝纫工人工会国际总书记布尔斯基报告说：纺织缝纫工人工会国际成立两年以来，已经有十九个国家的二十四个工会参加，会员总数为四百三十六万二千三百一十七人。布尔斯基接着报告了在美国、意大利、法国等国，由于生活必需品价格的上涨和捐税的增加，纺织缝纫工人罢工的浪潮日益扩大。
