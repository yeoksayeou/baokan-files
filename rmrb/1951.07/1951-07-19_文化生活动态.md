  Northwest Region's Minority Education Develops
　　The education of ethnic minorities in the Northwest region has made preliminary achievements after restoration and rectification by the local people's governments. According to recent statistics, there are five ethnic minority schools above the junior college level and ethnic minority departments attached to ordinary universities in the Northwest region, namely: Xinjiang Nationalities Institute (Dihua. The former Ahamaiti Jiang Normal College in the Yili area and Yining Medical College have been merged into the institute since this semester), Northwest Nationalities Institute (Lanzhou), Department of Ethnic Minority Languages of Lanzhou University, Department of Ethnology of Northwest University (Xi'an), and Department of Nationalities of Northwest Art Institute (Chang'an County), with a total of about 1,200 students. There are a total of thirty-seven secondary schools (materials from the Yili area are missing), with approximately 9,540 students from various ethnic groups. There are a total of 2,347 primary schools with 283,093 students (excluding private schools in Xinjiang). This year, in addition to allocating funds according to general standards, the People's Government has allocated an additional 7.92 billion yuan from the education budget as subsidies for ethnic minority schools, and has established an Ethnic Education Department within the Northwest Education Department to strengthen leadership over ethnic minority education.
　　The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other places can supply some of the five ethnic minority language textbooks currently used by ethnic minorities in the Northwest, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Russian. The Qinghai Provincial Department of Culture and Education has also compiled and printed more than 10,000 copies of Tibetan textbooks this semester. The Xinjiang People's Publishing House has also reprinted a large number of primary and secondary school textbooks in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian this year.
　　In order to solve the problem of teachers for various ethnic minorities, local educational administrative organs are actively training educational workers for ethnic minorities. There are currently twelve ethnic minority normal schools in the Northwest region, and various provinces have also established many short-term ethnic minority teacher training classes according to actual needs.
  Shanghai Publishing Industry Struggles to Correct Publishing Attitudes
　　The Shanghai publishing industry held a symposium on the 11th of this month to criticize the Chunming Bookstore for its poor style and proposed to take Chunming Bookstore as an example to carry out a comprehensive and in-depth examination to correct publishing attitudes.
　　The private Chunming Bookstore has been in operation for nearly 20 years and has consistently reprinted pornographic novels and reactionary books and periodicals, such as "Jin Ping Mei Album" and "Baojia System." After liberation, the store continued to use this stealing style, producing crudely and plagiarizing other people's works. For example, the "Political Common Sense Study Series," "Popular Explanations of the History of Revolutions in Various Countries," "Popular Explanations of Political Economy," etc., edited by Ye Fan, Lin Ming, and He Manzi, and "Reference Materials for Senior Elementary School History," "Reference Materials for Senior Elementary School Geography," and other books recently published by the store, infringed on the copyrights of publications of the Guangming Bookstore, People's Publishing House, and Hangzhou China Children's Bookstore. In order to help Chunming Bookstore carry out transformation work, the Shanghai publishing industry convened a symposium of the above-mentioned bookstores. At the meeting, colleagues in the publishing industry also severely criticized the store, unanimously pointing out that plagiarism of other people's works is theft; the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Press and Publication Office suggested that the publishing industry take a serious attitude towards publishing and formulate publishing plans. If there are difficulties in the conditions, a joint editorial department should be gradually organized to publish publications that are beneficial to readers in a guided, organized, and planned manner.
  The Masses Welcome "Serial Pictorial" and "Mass Pictorial"
　　The "Serial Pictorial" and "Mass Pictorial," recently launched by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, are two publications in the popular fine arts reading materials that deserve attention. Their content is strongly linked to the current major political tasks such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. They use serial pictures, which are easily accepted by the masses, as the main form of expression to carry out propaganda and education to the masses, and have been greatly welcomed by the masses. The "Mass Pictorial" has now published four issues, and the "Serial Pictorial" has published three issues, with a circulation of 400,000 to 500,000 copies. Among them, the better pictures depicting the happy scene of rural harvest after liberation are: Su Hui's "Wheat Harvest," Zou Ya's "Strictly Prevent Counter-Revolutionary Elements from Sabotaging Wheat Harvest," and Ma Ji's "The Tibetan People Are Happily Harvesting Green Barley" (all above from the fourth issue of "Mass Pictorial"); depicting the wit and bravery of the Chinese People's Volunteers are: Wu Biduan and Hou Yimin's book, Guang Jue's compilation, "What the Enemy Fears Most" (published in the first issue of "Serial Pictorial"), and Lu Guangzhao's compilation, Wang Baokang, Zhou Lushi, and Yan Xiumin's painting, "Capturing Prisoners with Wisdom and Courage" (published in the second issue of "Serial Pictorial"). The long serial "The Fate of Life and Death" (original by Kong Jue and Yuan Jing, adapted by Xu Gan, painted by Liu Jiyou) describes the flesh-and-blood relationship formed by the Chinese and Korean people in the anti-imperialist struggle. This is a more attractive set of serial pictures; there are also serial pictures with the theme of suppressing counter-revolutionaries: "Tricycle Workers Arrest Special Agents" (compiled by Yu Jin, painted by Shao Guohuan and Wang Jiao, see the first issue of "Serial Pictorial"), "No Escape" (compiled and painted by Li Baochu and Tang Wenxuan, see the third issue of "Serial Pictorial"), "Registration" (compiled by Tang Yin, painted by Mo Lang, see the second issue of "Serial Pictorial"), "Ou Xiumei Cleverly Captures Her Bandit Husband Alive" (written by Su Hui, see the first issue of "Mass Pictorial"), etc., all with their own characteristics, reflecting the workers, peasants, and shop assistants in the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement, the improvement of political awareness and the exertion of their enthusiasm.
  The Recently Published "Beijing Literature" Pays Attention to Selecting and Publishing Works by Workers and the Masses
　　In order to strengthen the mass character of the publication, "Beijing Literature" has recently begun to pay attention to selecting and publishing works by workers and the masses. For example, the second issue of Volume 4 concentrated on publishing entries from the "Beijing Workers' 'May Day' Creation Competition" and the "Capital of the Great Motherland" essay contest, including eight works by workers, two works by soldiers, and four works by students and teachers. The more characteristic works include: "On the Production Front" (drum lyrics), which expresses the working class's attitude of being the master of the country and their high enthusiasm for labor. "Electing Model Workers" (crosstalk) vividly introduces the correct attitude and method of electing model workers through simple dialogue between two people. "I am a Guarding Soldier of the People's Capital" (poem) profoundly expresses the soldier's love for the motherland's capital and the people. Each of these works has fresh content, and the forms are mostly short, concise, lively, and vigorous.

    西北少数民族目前所应用的维、哈、蒙、藏、俄等五种少数民族文字课本内蒙自冶区等地可供应一部。青海省文教厅本学期也编印了藏文课本一万余册。新疆人民出版社今年并大量翻印维、哈、蒙等少数民族文字的中、小学课本。
    为解决各少数民族的师资问题，各地教育行政机关正在积极培养少数民族教育工作者。西北区现有少数民族师范学校十二所，各省并按实际需要设立了许多短期的少数民族师资训练班。
  上海出版界为端正出版态度而斗争
    上海出版界在本月十一日举行了一次座谈会，对作风恶劣的春明书店展开批评，并提出要以春明书店为例，展开全面深入检查，以端正出版态度。
    私营春明书店开办近二十年，一贯翻印色情小说和反动书刊，如《金瓶梅画册》、《保甲制度》等。解放后，该店仍继续运用这种偷窃作风，粗制滥造，抄袭他人的作品。如最近该店出版的，由叶帆、林明、何满子等编著的《政治常识学习小丛书》、《各国革命史通俗题解》、《政治经济通俗题解》等，以及《高小历史科参考资料》、《高小地理科参考资料》等书，侵害了光明书局、人民出版社及杭州中国儿童书店出版物的版权。上海出版界为帮助春明书店进行改造工作，曾召集上述各书店举行了座谈会。会上，出版界同业对该店亦进行了深刻的批评，一致指出抄袭他人著作是偷窃行为；上海市新闻出版处的代表建议出版界严肃出版态度，订出出版计划。如条件有困难的应该逐步组织联合编辑部，有领导、有组织、有计划地出版对读者有益的出版物。
  群众欢迎《连环画报》和《群众画报》
    人民美术出版社最近创刊的《连环画报》和《群众画报》，是通俗化的美术读物中，值得重视的两个刊物。它们的内容，强烈地结合着目前抗美援朝、镇压反革命等重大政治任务，以群众易于接受的连环图画为主要表现形式，向群众进行宣传和教育，受到了群众很大欢迎。现《群众画报》已出版四期，《连环画报》已出版三期，发行数已达四、五十万份。其中比较好的图画，表现解放后农村丰收愉快情景的有：苏晖的《麦收》，邹雅的《严防反革命分子破坏麦收》，马骥的《藏族人民愉快地在打青果麦》（以上见《群众画报》第四期）；表现人民志愿军的机智、勇敢的有：伍必端、侯逸民书，广觉编的《敌人最害怕的》（刊《连环画报》第一期），卢光照编，王宝康、周路石、鄢修民画的《智勇捉俘虏》（刊《连环画报》第二期）。长篇连载的《生死缘》（孔厥、袁静原著，徐淦改编，刘继卣画），描写中朝人民在反帝斗争中所结成的血肉缘分，这是一套比较吸引人的连环图画；还有以镇压反革命为主题的：《三轮车工人捉特务》（余金编，邵国寰、王角画，见《连环画报》第一期）、《插翅难逃》（李葆初、汤文选编绘，见《连环画报》第三期）、《登记》（唐殷编，墨浪画，见《连环画报》第二期）、《欧秀妹巧计活捉土匪丈夫》（苏晖作，见《群众画报》第一期）等连环画，都各具特色，反映工人、农民、店员在镇压反革命运动中，政治觉悟的提高和发挥了他们的积极性。
  最近出版的《北京文艺》注意选登工人群众作品
    《北京文艺》最近为了加强刊物的群众性，开始注意选登工人群众的作品，如在二卷四期上便集中发表了《北京工人“五一”创作竞赛》和《伟大祖国的首都》征文的应征作品，计有工人作品八篇，战士作品两篇，学生和教师作品四篇。较有特点的作品，如：《在生产战线上》（鼓词），表现了工人阶级主人翁的劳动态度和高度的劳动热情。《选劳模》（相声）通过两个人简单的对话，生动地介绍出正确的选举模范的态度和方法。《我是人民首都的警卫战士》（诗歌），比较深刻地写出了战士对祖国首都和人民的热爱。这些作品，每篇都有新鲜的内容，形式也大都是短小精悍生动活泼的。
