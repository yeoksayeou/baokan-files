　　Anti-Waste Must Start with Key Issues
    Gao Shijin, Director of Mudanjiang Textile Factory

    To reduce costs and waste, factory administrative leaders must have a clear understanding of the key issues affecting costs and mobilize the masses to find solutions. The state-owned Mudanjiang Textile Factory, after taking a detour, discovered this experience and reduced the planned cost of cotton yarn.

    In 1949, the Mudanjiang Textile Factory experienced significant waste. The higher-level leading organs specifically instructed the factory to launch a campaign to inspect leadership and oppose waste. At that time, the factory's leading comrades did not understand technology or business, and did not know which major wastes should be opposed in a cotton textile factory. They could not point out a clear direction to everyone in the anti-waste campaign. The retained technical personnel in the factory, because they did not understand the policies and had many concerns, stood by and did not speak out during the movement. Leading cadres only focused on mobilizing workers to offer opinions. The workers were very enthusiastic about anti-waste; however, because the leading cadres did not point out a clear direction, they could only offer opinions based on what was happening around them. As a result, they were just going around in circles on some small issues, and did not find the main key to anti-waste. In March 1949, the cotton consumption for one piece of 16-count yarn was as high as 430.5 catties (the average standard was 419.49 catties). However, during the anti-waste campaign, everyone did not pay attention to this issue – finding ways to save raw cotton. The result of saving in small places was that the cost was not reduced much, and sometimes it was counterproductive. For example, in order to use two fewer people, the factory's telephone switchboard was cancelled, and problems were communicated by running errands; in order to save money, some machine parts were broken, and they were not replaced when they should have been, so that when problems occurred, they were caught off guard and forced to stop or reduce productivity; oiling workers tried their best to reduce the amount of oil and the number of oiling times in order to save oil, and the machines were worn out as a result. After the leading cadres discovered these problems, they held various meetings to correct the above-mentioned deviations; then they opened the factory's monthly cost calculation sheets and carefully studied the cost composition, and then they discovered that the largest proportion of the cost was the consumption of raw cotton and raw yarn. With a clear understanding of the leadership's thinking, they immediately called on everyone to work hard to save raw cotton, and mobilized technical personnel and workers from various departments to study ways to save cotton. At the same time, a batch of machine parts was repaired and replaced, necessary ancillary equipment was assembled, and necessary management systems were formulated to prepare objective conditions for saving cotton. In terms of saving cotton, in addition to paying attention at all times to whether there was good cotton in the cotton cleaning and carding waste; grasping the inspection of the unqualified rate of finished and semi-finished products in each workshop, and trying to reduce the return of cotton; mastering the temperature and humidity of each workshop, and maintaining the standard moisture content of the original yarn; checking at any time whether there were yarn ends mixed in the oil cotton and floor cotton of each workshop; and trying to reduce the amount of messy cotton from fine yarn to winding yarn. The most important thing is to use inferior cotton to spin good yarn, and strive to change the cotton blending composition to below the standard specifications, and maintain the quality of the original yarn in accordance with the standard specifications. This is the most effective way to reduce costs. Through the active efforts of all employees, the amount of cotton used has been greatly reduced, and the cost has been significantly reduced. The amount of cotton used per piece of 20-count yarn has gradually decreased from 423 catties to about 390 catties, and this achievement is still maintained. In 1950, the actual cost of 20-count yarn for the whole year was 13.12% lower than the planned cost, of which 10.03% came from reducing the grade of cotton used and reducing basic material costs. Last year, the factory director's fund generated by reducing costs was more than RMB 870 million, and more than RMB 280 million was used for employee welfare facilities.

    After the key to reducing costs was found, the workers' thinking became numb again, thinking that the big problem had been grasped and solved, and it didn't matter whether they paid attention to the small places or not. As a result, they didn't think about saving what should be saved. For example, in order to strengthen the planning and statistics work, the leadership emphasized strict procedures and conscientiously implemented various report forms, and the phenomenon of indiscriminate printing of forms in various departments was quite serious; in order to facilitate accounting, the leadership stipulated the one-bill-one-material receipt procedures, and some competent departments mechanically implemented it, and even if they received a light bulb, they had to fill out thirty-two transfer slips, causing unnecessary waste of manpower and materials. This situation shows that many comrades' understanding of cost reduction is not comprehensive, and they forget the small things when they grasp the big things. The leadership must also strengthen the education of cost accounting, and strive to correct the above-mentioned deviations, promote cost accounting from the whole factory to each workshop, calculate profits and losses separately, and reward and punish accordingly, in order to further promote the enthusiasm and creativity of employees in reducing costs, and combine the interests of the country and the individual more closely.

### 反浪费必须从关键问题着手

　　反浪费必须从关键问题着手
    牡丹江纺织厂厂长  高士瑾
    为了降低成本，减少浪费，工厂行政领导方面必须心中有数，抓住影响成本的关键问题，发动群众想办法解决。国营牡丹江纺织厂经过了一段弯路，找出了这一经验，降低了棉纱的计划成本。
    一九四九年牡丹江纺织厂的浪费很大。上级领导机关特指示该厂，开展检查领导反对浪费运动。当时，厂里领导同志不懂技术不懂业务，不知道在棉纺织厂中应该反对那些主要的浪费，在反浪费运动中不能给大家指出一个明确的方向。厂里留用的技术人员因为对政策不了解，顾虑很多，在运动中袖手旁观，不肯发言。领导干部也就只着重发动工人提意见。工人们对反浪费的热情很高；但是由于领导干部没有给指出明确的方向，他们就只能根据自己身边的事情提意见。结果，净是在一些小问题上打圈子，而没有找出反浪费的主要关键。一九四九年三月份，一件十六支纱用棉高达四百三十点五斤（中等标准为四百十九点四九斤）。但是，在反浪费运动中大家却没有注意这一问题——从节省原棉上想办法。在小地方上节约的结果，不但成本没有降低多少，有时反而因小误大。比如，为了少用两个人，把厂里的电话交换台取消了，有问题靠跑腿传达；为了节约，有些机器的零件坏了，该换不换，以至发生毛病时，措手不及，被迫停车或降低生产率；浇油工为了省油，尽力减少浇油量和浇油次数，机器因之被磨坏。领导干部发现了这些问题后，召开了各种会议，纠正了上述偏向；接着又把厂中各月的成本计算书翻开，仔细研究成本构成情况，这才发现了占成本比率最大的是原棉原纱的消耗。领导思想清醒了，立即号召大家，努力节约原棉，发动技术人员和各部工人研究节约用棉办法。同时修换了一批机器零件，装配了必需的附属设备，订出必要的管理制度，为节约用棉准备了客观条件。在节约用棉方面，除了时刻注意清花梳棉落棉中有无好花；抓紧检查各车间成品半成品的不合格率，尽力减少回花；掌握各车间的温湿度，保持原纱的标准水分；随时检查各车间的油棉落地棉里是否混有纱头棒棉；在细纱到卷纱中，尽力减少乱棉等。最重要的是使用下等棉花纺好纱，努力把配棉成份改变到标准规格以下，并保持原纱质量合乎标准规格。这是降低成本的最有效的办法。经过全体职工的积极努力，用棉量大大减少，成本显著降低。二十支纱每件的用棉量已从四百二十三斤逐渐减少到三百九十斤左右，直到现在仍保持这个成绩。一九五○年全年二十支纱的实际成本，比计划成本降低了百分之十三点一二，其中就有百分之十点零三是从降低用棉等级、减少基本材料费得来的。去年由于降低成本而产生的厂长基金就有人民币八亿又七千余万元，用于职工福利设施的有两亿又八千余万元。
    降低成本的关键找着了，职工们的思想又麻痹起来了，认为大问题已经抓住解决了，小地方注意不注意没什么关系。于是，该节省的也不想法节省。比如，领导上为了加强计划统计工作，强调严格手续，认真执行各种表报制度，各科室滥印表格的现象就相当严重；领导方面为了便于记账，规定一单一料的领料手续，有的主管部门就机械地执行，甚至领一盏电灯，要填三十二张传票，造成人力物力的无益损耗。这种情况说明不少同志对于降低成本的认识还不全面，抓住大的又忘记了小的。领导上还须加强成本核算的教育，努力纠正上述偏向，把成本核算从全厂范围推行到各个车间去，分别计算盈亏，并依此进行奖惩，才能更进一步地发挥职工对降低成本的积极性与创造性，把国家利益与个人利益更紧密地结合起来。
