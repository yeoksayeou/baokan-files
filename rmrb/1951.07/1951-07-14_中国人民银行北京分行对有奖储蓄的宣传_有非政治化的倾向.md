    China People's Bank Beijing Branch's Promotion of Prize-Linked Savings Has a Tendency Towards De-Politicization
    To the Editor:
    Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, various localities have paid attention to correcting one-sided propaganda lacking clear political content, such as "Growing cotton will make you rich" and "Get rich quickly." They have also focused on implementing patriotic education in various tasks. However, some organizations have not paid enough attention to this point. For example, when the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China promoted prize-linked savings in early July, many promotional materials simply emphasized the personal benefits of winning a prize, without any political content. The content of these promotional materials included: "Old Zhang next door often goes out, but has no money to buy new shoes, so his shoes are worn out. With prize-linked savings, he won a prize and rides around quickly on a new bike." "The second son is getting married and renting a new house, with only a bed and no furniture. The second daughter-in-law saved and won a prize, and bought new shiny tables and chairs." "Wang Wu's little bald head is eight years old and needs school fees urgently. Saving and winning a prize of 100,000 yuan covers all the book and tuition fees." "Saving one pack of cigarettes a day can build a house in ten years. Saving 500 yuan a day is enough to buy a donkey in three years." ... These are all extremely vulgar. However, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China printed them in red and green and posted them extensively in the rural areas surrounding Beijing. In addition, many comrades in other enterprise departments do not consider political orientation. For example, I have heard some comrades say: "We work in enterprise departments and use technology to guide our work; we can't work without learning a new procedure, so it doesn't matter if we delay political study."
    I believe that this kind of economic thought that neglects politics is very harmful to our work. Therefore, I am telling you what I know to draw everyone's attention.

### 中国人民银行北京分行对有奖储蓄的宣传  有非政治化的倾向

    中国人民银行北京分行对有奖储蓄的宣传
    有非政治化的倾向编辑同志：
    抗美援朝运动开展后，各地已注意纠正像“要发家种棉花”、“发家致富”等片面的缺乏明确政治内容的宣传；在各种工作中都注意贯彻了爱国主义教育。但是，还有某些机关对这一点注意得还很不够。如北京市人民银行在七月初宣传有奖储蓄时，有很多宣传品只是单纯地提出得奖后如何对个人有利，而没有丝毫政治内容。这些宣传品的内容有：“隔壁张三常出外，无钱买车鞋跑坏，有奖储蓄中了奖，骑着新车跑得快。”“老二成家新租房，没有家具只有床，二嫂储蓄得了奖，新买桌椅亮光光 。”“王五小秃已八岁，入学急着筹学费，储蓄得奖十万元，书钱学费都齐备。”“一天节省一包烟，十年就可盖房院，每日储蓄五百元，三年足够买驴钱。”……这都是极端庸俗的。但中国人民银行北京分行却用红绿纸石印了，在京郊农村中贴得很多。此外，其他企业部门同志不问政治倾向的也很多。如我曾听到有些同志说：“我们是在企业部门工作的，是用技术指导工作；一个新手续不学，我们就不能工作，政治学习拖一拖不要紧。”
    我认为：这种忽视政治的经济主义思想，对我们的工作是很有害的。因此，我把我所了解的情况告诉你们，请发表以引起大家注意。
