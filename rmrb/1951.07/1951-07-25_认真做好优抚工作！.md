    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Providing Preferential Treatment!
　　The egalitarianism in the work of preferential treatment in Lishan County, Hubei Province, urgently needs to be corrected.
To the Editor:
    In some villages of Lishan County, Hubei Province, an egalitarian tendency occurred when distributing subsidies to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Before distributing the subsidies, these villages neither conducted thorough investigations and assessments nor mistakenly included some collateral relatives who should not have been entitled to preferential treatment into the scope of preferential treatment. As a result of distributing subsidies equally by household or by population, the actual difficulties of some martyrs' and soldiers' families could not be solved at all. In Xincheng Township of the county, a total of 182 households received subsidies, but among them, 41 households were non-direct relatives (according to the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Revolutionary Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government: the families of revolutionary soldiers refer to direct blood relatives, spouses, and siblings under the age of sixteen who live with the soldiers and depend on the soldiers for their living, or other relatives who have relied on the soldiers for their upbringing since childhood and now must rely on the soldiers for their living. From this, it can be seen that general non-direct relatives cannot be regarded as families of revolutionary soldiers). In addition, two rich peasant households also each received 120 catties of subsidies. However, the widowed and orphaned soldiers' families of Gao Chen, Xu Liang, and Tian Li, who were particularly in need of assistance, each received only less than 100 catties of subsidies. Chen Zurong, a martyr's family in Fengdian Township of the county, had a total of three people in his family and had labor power, but because his elder brother was a township representative, he received 320 catties of subsidies. On the contrary, Meng Zhongtian, a soldier's family lacking labor power and living in poverty, only received 36 catties of subsidies. In Xincheng Township, the township cadres Tian Zhiyu and Tian Houyu also committed embezzlement by taking the subsidies of soldier's family Xiong Wenzhan and dividing them among themselves. The occurrence of these deviations shows that the leaders of the county have not paid enough attention to the work of preferential treatment in peacetime and have not done a good job in publicizing the preferential treatment policy to the masses. In order to further consolidate our People's Liberation Army and strengthen our national defense construction, it is hoped that the county will quickly check and overcome these shortcomings in the work of preferential treatment.

　　The People's Government of Chahar went to Datong to inspect plowing on behalf of soldiers' families
　  Correct the Phenomenon of Giving More Importance to Families of Staff and Workers than to Families of Martyrs and Soldiers
To the Editor:
    In the work of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families in the first district of Datong County, Chahar, there has been a tendency to give more importance to the families of revolutionary staff and workers and neglect the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. The amount of land plowed on behalf of the families of staff and workers accounted for slightly less than 70 percent of the total land of the families of staff and workers, the amount of land plowed on behalf of the families of soldiers accounted for slightly more than 67 percent of the total land of the families of soldiers, and the amount of land plowed on behalf of the families of martyrs only accounted for slightly more than 43 percent of the total land of the families of martyrs. Yan Wanxi, a worker's family in Dongluotuo Village of the district, enjoyed 6.94 dou of rice plowed on his behalf, which almost accounted for one-third of the rice plowed on behalf of soldiers' families in the whole village. Three workers' families in Weizhou Tuan Village enjoyed one-third of the labor plowed on behalf of soldiers' families in the whole village. One of the workers' families, with only two people in the family, had enough rice plowed on their behalf, but still enjoyed 145 workdays of labor plowed on their behalf. This practice of reversing the importance of "martyrs, soldiers, and workers" completely violates the preferential treatment policy of the Central People's Government. After the above deviations were discovered by the People's Government of Chahar Province during inspection, they are now being corrected.

　　Xiahe Village, Lingchuan, Shanxi, Neglects Plowing on Behalf of Soldiers' Families
　  Insufficient Fertilization of Land for Families of Martyrs and Soldiers
To the Editor:
    In Xiahe Village, Seventh District, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, a total of 16 households of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers' families enjoyed plowing on their behalf, with 34.5 mu of land. Among them, 14 mu of land received 80 dan of base fertilizer; 13 mu received 50 dan of base fertilizer; and 7.5 mu received no fertilizer at all. 18 mu of paddy fields were hoeed only once; 16.5 mu of corn fields were plowed only twice. The land of Wang Bingchen, a revolutionary soldier's family, was 5.3 mu, with an average of less than 16 dan of base fertilizer per mu. Another 2.2 mu of land had not been fertilized for eight years. Because the work of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families in the village was not done seriously, many martyrs' and soldiers' families suffered serious difficulties in production and life. The daughter-in-law of Wang Bingchen, a revolutionary soldier, said: "Plowing on behalf of soldiers' families sounds good, but it is not done well. The village cadres are not happy if you ask for more." The work of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families in the village was actually done very poorly, but when they reported to the county People's Government, they said: "The work of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families in our village is very good, and there are no problems." After the county People's Government sent cadres to the village for actual inspection, they discovered the above problems. The county inspectors asked the village cadres: "Why was the 2.2 mu of land of Wang Bingchen's family not fertilized?" The village civil affairs director said: "When Wang Bingchen was at home, the land was never fertilized. It is not a problem now." Wang Baowu, the preferential treatment committee member, was also unclear about the number of households enjoying plowing on their behalf in the village. They thought that having a plowing-on-behalf group meant that they had completed the task of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families. This style of neglecting the work of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families and abandoning leadership should be quickly checked and corrected to ensure that the production and life of martyrs' and soldiers' families are not lower than the level of the general public.

　　One Should Not Treat the Families of Revolutionary Soldiers with a Bureaucratic Attitude
To the Editor:
    Houqiao Village, Xiejji District, Qingyun County, Shandong Province, should not delay resolving the preferential treatment issue for Wang Jinxi, a revolutionary soldier's family. Wang Wenfu, the son of Wang Jinxi, joined the People's Liberation Army (then the Eighth Route Army) in 1938. Wang Wenfu returned home once in 1945 when the Japanese invaders surrendered, and then went north with the army and has not been heard from since. Wang Jinxi has been enjoying preferential treatment as a soldier's family since his son joined the army. However, in August 1949, the village cadres suddenly canceled Wang's soldier's family treatment on the grounds that the superiors had instructed that the soldier's family treatment should be canceled for those who do not know which army their children are in and have not heard from them for a long time. Wang Jinxi immediately went to the county government to appeal to a section chief. The section chief said that his soldier's family preferential treatment should not be canceled and wrote a letter for him to find the head of Xiejji District to solve the problem. After Wang Jinxi arrived in the district, the district cadres asked him to find the township head, and later the township head pushed it to the village, and the village cadres ignored it. The problem has not been resolved so far. I hope that the local government will quickly resolve Wang Jinxi's preferential treatment issue and conduct a serious review of this bureaucratic attitude of not attaching importance to soldiers' families.

　　Housewives in Yixin Lane, Dawangzhuang, Tianjin, Voluntarily Comforted Troops Stationed in a Certain Place
To the Editor:
    On June 24, sixty housewives in the jurisdiction of Yixin Lane Police Station, Dawangzhuang, Fifth District, Tianjin, voluntarily formed four groups to comfort troops stationed in a certain place and to wash clothes and make quilts for the soldiers. They carried basins, washboards, needles, thread and other utensils, got up early, ate breakfast and took dry food with them. An old woman living in an alley, Ms. Liu, said: "Every day we promote resisting America and aiding Korea, this time is our practical action." When they arrived at the army garrison, the soldiers stood in two rows, applauding and cheering. The old women also responded with cheers and applause. Everyone was full of smiles, as if they had met their relatives, and they were indescribably happy. After the work started, everyone scrambled to do it. Some washed clothes, some made quilts, and some fluffed cotton. The soldiers surrounded them, fetching water, offering cigarettes, telling stories, and the old women also talked about their family affairs. One old woman, Ms. Wang, was more than seventy years old this year, and her eyes were a little blurred. She led her ten-year-old granddaughter to participate in the dismantling and washing work. The soldiers were worried that she would be tired, but she said: "Comrades are fighting and bleeding on the front line. What is it to me to wash some clothes?" Jin Xiulan also said: "You are shedding blood and sweat on the front line, all for us. After Tianjin was liberated, my family members found jobs, and life is much better than before." The soldiers advised her to take a break and then continue, but she asked in return: "When you are fighting the enemy on the front line, can you take a break?" The soldiers all laughed.
    They worked happily like this for a day, and the soldiers prepared food for everyone, but they refused to eat. The soldiers were very grateful and sang and danced for the old women. In addition, each class wrote more than 30 thank-you letters to the old women. A thank-you letter from a certain class wrote: You are so kind to make quilts and wash clothes for us in your busy schedule, just like our own mothers and sisters, which makes me so touched that I can't speak. Dear mothers and sisters, we promise to improve our combat skills in our studies, master modern weapons, ensure that we do not violate discipline, and resolutely implement the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention.
    The next day, these old women read these letters in the reading group. The old women also wrote back to the soldiers, saying that they would often take time out in the future to do work for the soldiers.

    认真做好优抚工作！
　　湖北礼山县优抚工作中平均主义思想亟应纠正编辑同志：
    湖北省礼山县某些乡村在发放革命烈士、革命军人家属补助粮时，曾发生平均主义的偏向。这些村在发补助粮以前，既未很好的调查了解和进行评定，而且有一些不应享受优待的旁系亲属也都错误地列到优待范围以内了。这样按户或按人口平均分发的结果，一部分烈属和军属的实际困难就根本不可能得到解决。该县新城乡共有一百八十二户领了补助粮的，但其中非直系亲属就有四十一户（按中央人民政府内务部公布的《革命烈士家属革命军人家属优待暂行条例》的规定：革命军人家属系指与军人同居之直系血亲、配偶及依靠军人生活之十六岁以下的弟妹，或军人自幼曾依靠其抚养长大现在又必须依靠军人生活的其他亲属。由此可知，一般非直系亲属并不能算做革命军人家属），另外，还有两户富农，也各领得补助粮一百二十斤。而生活上特别困难的孤寡军属高陈氏、徐梁氏、田李氏等每人所领到的补助粮也只是一百斤以内。该县丰店乡烈属陈祖容，家中共三口人，有劳动力，但由于他的哥哥是乡代表，所以他就领到补助粮三百二十斤。相反的对缺乏劳动力生活困难的军属孟中田只发了补助粮三十六斤。在新城乡并发生了乡干部田志玉、田厚玉二人将军属熊文站的补助粮领出分吃了的贪污事件。这些偏向的发生，表明该县领导方面平时对优抚工作重视不够，没有很好的向群众宣传优抚政策。为了进一步巩固我们的人民解放军，加强我们的国防建设，希望该县迅速检查并克服优抚工作中的这些缺点。

　　察哈尔人民政府到大同检查代耕
　  纠正烈军工属轻重倒置现象编辑同志：
    察哈尔大同县一区的代耕工作中，发生了偏重革命工作人员家属，忽视革命烈士家属及革命军人家属的偏向。该区工属代耕土地数量占全部工属土地的百分之七十弱，军属代耕土地数量占全部军属土地的百分之六十七强，烈属代耕土地数量只占全部烈属土地的百分之四十三强。该区东骆驼房村工属阎万喜，享受代耕米六石九斗四升，将近占去全村代耕米的三分之一。蔚州疃村三户工属享受了占全村三分之一的代耕工，内有一户工属，家中仅有两口人只代耕米就够用了，却还享受了代耕工一百四十五个。这种将“烈、军、工”属轻重倒置的作法，完全违背了中央人民政府的优抚政策。以上偏向，经察哈尔省人民政府检查发觉后，现正在纠正中。

　　山西陵川下河村轻视代耕
　  烈属军属的土地施肥不足编辑同志：
    山西省陵川县七区下河村享受代耕的革命烈士及革命军人家属共十六户，土地三十四点五亩，其中上底肥八十担的有十四亩；五十担的十三亩；一点肥没上的七点五亩。有十八亩谷地只锄过一遍；十六点五亩玉茭地只犁过两遍。革命军人王丙辰家属的地五点三亩，平均每亩上底肥不到十六担，另有二点二亩地已八年没有上过肥。因为该村的代耕工作做得很不认真，所以有不少的烈军属生产、生活遭受到严重困难。革命军人王丙辰的媳妇说：“代耕说的好，做的不好，找的多了村干部还不高兴。”该村的代耕工作实际上做的很不好，但是他们向县人民政府作报告时却说：“我村代耕工作很好，没有什么问题。”这一次县人民政府派干部到该村作了实际检查后，发现了以上问题，县的检查人员向村干部询问：“王丙辰家二亩二分地为什么没上肥？”该村民政主任说：“王丙辰在家时，地里就没上过肥，不是现在的问题。”优抚委员王保五对该村享受代耕户的数字也弄不清楚。他们认为有了代耕组就算完成了代耕任务。这种忽视代耕工作，放弃领导的作风，应该急速检查纠正。以保证烈、军属的生产、生活不低于一般群众的水平。

　　不应该用官僚主义的态度对待革命军人家属编辑同志：
    山东省庆云县解集区后桥村不该拖延不解决革命军人家属王金玺的优待问题。军属王金玺的儿子王文富，系一九三八年参加人民解放军（当时为八路军），一九四五年日寇投降时，王文富曾回家一次，后即随军北上，至今没有消息。王金玺自儿子参军后即享受军属优待。但至一九四九年八月，村干部突然取消王的军属待遇，理由是：上级有指示，凡不知道自己的子弟在何军队而又常久没有音信者，即取消军属待遇。王金玺随即到县政府向一位科长申诉。该科长说他的军属优待不该取消，并写了一封信让他去找解集区区长解决。王金玺到区上后，区干部又让他去找乡长，后来乡长又推到村上，村干部则置之不理，问题至今未获解决。我希望当地政府迅速解决王金玺的优待问题，并对这种不重视军属的官僚主义态度认真进行检讨。

　　天津市大王庄义信里家庭妇女自动慰问某地驻军编辑同志：
    六月二十四日，天津市五区大王庄义信里派出所管界内的六十名家庭妇女，自动组成了四个小组赴某军驻地慰问，并给战士们洗衣做被。她们携带着木盆、搓板、针、线等用具，一早起吃完了早饭捎着干粮就一块走了。一条胡同住的刘大娘说：“天天宣传抗美援朝，这回才是咱们的实际行动呢。”到了军队驻地，战士们站齐了两行队伍，鼓掌欢呼。老太太妇女们也同样报以欢呼和掌声。每个人满面笑容，真和见了亲人一样，心里有说不出来的高兴。工作开始后，大家争先恐后地抢着干，有的洗衣服，有的做被子，有的絮棉花。战士们围绕在他们旁边，替老大娘们打水拿烟讲故事，老大娘也叙说家常。有一位王老太太今年七十多岁了，眼睛已有点花，她领着十岁的小孙女参加拆洗工作。战士们耽心累着她，她却说：“同志们在前方拼命流血，跟敌人打仗，我洗点衣服算什么。”金秀兰也说：“你们在前方流血流汗，不都是为了我们。天津解放后，家里人才有了工作，生活也比过去强多了。”战士们劝她歇一歇再干，她却反过来问道：“你们在前线跟敌人作战的时候，歇一回行吗？”问得战士们都笑起来了。
    她们就这样愉快地干了一天，战士们为大家准备饭，她们都不肯吃。战士们感激得很，便为老大娘们唱歌跳舞。另外各班又给老大娘们写了三十多封感谢信。某班的感谢信上写着：你们在百忙中替我们做被子洗衣服，真好比我们的亲母亲，亲姐妹，使我感动得说不出话来。亲爱的母亲、姐妹们，我们保证在学习中提高战斗技术，掌握现代化的武器，保证不犯纪律，坚决执行三大纪律八项注意。
    第二天这些老大娘们就在读报小组里把这些信念出来。老大娘们并给战士们写了回信，表示今后要经常抽出时间来，给战士们做活。
