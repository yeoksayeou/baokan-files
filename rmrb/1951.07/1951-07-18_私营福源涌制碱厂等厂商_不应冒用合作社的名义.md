　　Private Fuyuan Yong Alkali Factory and other Manufacturers
    Should Not Misuse the Name of Cooperatives

Editor:
    Recently, we have continuously discovered in Beijing that some private merchants are deceiving the masses by misusing the name of cooperatives. For example, the private Fuyuan Yong Alkali Factory in the Third District misuses the cooperative's trademark on the wrapping paper of the alkali blocks it sells; a private tea shop in Xidan Toutiao Hutong is called "Cooperative Tea Shop"; in addition, some private small factories also casually use the name "Cooperative Factory". We believe that whether using the name "Cooperative Tea Shop" or "Cooperative Factory", it is easy for the masses to mistakenly believe that these are tea shops or factories affiliated to the cooperative, which will confuse the masses' understanding of the cooperative economy; and the act of private Fuyuan Yong Alkali Factory misusing the cooperative's trademark is an unacceptable act of deception. We hope that private manufacturers and merchants who misuse cooperative trademarks and cooperative names will consciously correct themselves.

### 私营福源涌制碱厂等厂商  不应冒用合作社的名义

　　私营福源涌制碱厂等厂商
    不应冒用合作社的名义编辑同志：
    最近我们不断在北京市发现某些私商冒用合作社的名义欺骗群众。如三区私营福源涌制碱厂，在售出碱块的包装纸上，冒用合作社的商标；西单头条胡同某私营茶庄名为“合作茶庄”；另外还有某些私营小工厂也随便用“合作工厂”的名字。我们认为无论用“合作茶庄”或“合作工厂”的名称，都容易使群众误认为这是合作社附设的茶庄或工厂，这样也就会混淆群众对合作经济的认识；而像私营福源涌制碱厂那样冒用合作社的商标，更是不能允许的欺骗行为。希望冒用合作社商标及合作为名的私营厂商，自觉地改正。
