　　Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The Singapore epidemic station of the "United Nations World Health Organization" has issued four communiques since March 1951, fabricating our country's epidemic situation. The contents of these communiques include: the British colonial authorities of Singapore, Malaya, and Sarawak, and the Dutch authorities of New Guinea absurdly announced on March 6th, April 26th, and March 28th, 1951 that all coastal ports of our country were "smallpox epidemic ports"; the British colonial authorities of Hong Kong announced Zhanjiang as a "smallpox epidemic port" on March 27th, 1951, and noted that travelers from the "epidemic port" could be detained for inspection. Following the unreasonable announcement by the British colonial authorities of Hong Kong and Colombo on July 10th and August 6th, 1950 that Xiamen in our country was a plague port, this is another series of slanders against the Chinese people by the colonial authorities of the American imperialist puppet states through the "United Nations World Health Organization" manipulated by American imperialism. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government refuted this as follows:
    Since the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it has correctly implemented the health policy of "prevention first" and has basically controlled the epidemic of acute infectious diseases. Due to the implementation of universal vaccination, significant achievements have been made in the prevention of smallpox in all coastal ports in the past year. For example, no smallpox cases occurred in coastal areas such as Dalian, Yingkou, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou in 1950. Therefore, the announcement by the British and Dutch colonial authorities and the "United Nations World Health Organization" that all coasts of our country are "smallpox epidemic areas" is a groundless slander and an act of hostility towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people express deep indignation at this.
    The Ministry of Health of our Central People's Government has also issued a notice to all transportation quarantine stations, stating that any such absurd announcements, notices, or letters will be ignored from now on.

　　英荷殖民当局诬蔑我国
　  我卫生部发言人严予驳斥
　  指出我国各港埠基本上已控制了急性传染病的流行
    【新华社二十三日讯】“联合国世界卫生组织”新加坡疫情站自一九五一年三月以来，曾经有过四次发表捏造我国疫情的通告，这些通告的内容包括：新加坡、马来亚和萨拉瓦克英国殖民当局及荷属新几内亚当局于一九五一年三月六日、四月二十六日及三月二十八日荒谬地宣布我国全部海岸港口为“天花疫港”；香港英殖民当局于一九五一年三月二十七日宣布湛江为“天花疫港”，并注明自“疫港”去的旅客可以扣留查验。这是继一九五○年七月十日及八月六日香港和科伦坡英国殖民当局无理宣布我国厦门为鼠疫港之后，美帝国主义仆从国家的殖民当局通过美帝国主义操纵的“联合国世界卫生组织”对我国人民又一系列的诬蔑。中央人民政府卫生部发言人为此驳斥如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以来，正确地执行以预防为主的卫生政策，基本上已控制了急性传染病的流行。由于推行普种牛痘，一年多以来已在全部海岸各港埠的预防天花工作中表现了显著的成绩，如大连、营口、秦皇岛、烟台、厦门、广州等沿海地方在一九五○年都没有发生过天花。所以英荷各殖民当局与“联合国世界卫生组织”宣布我国全部海岸为“天花疫区”是毫无根据的诬蔑和对中国人民的敌视行动，中国人民对此深表愤怒。
    我中央人民政府卫生部并已向各地交通检疫所发出通告，今后对此类荒诞无稽之任何宣布通知或函件，均将不予理睬。
