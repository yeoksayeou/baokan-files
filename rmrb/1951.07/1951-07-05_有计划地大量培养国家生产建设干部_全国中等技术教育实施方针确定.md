　　Planned Mass Training of Cadres for National Production and Construction
　　Implementation Guidelines for National Secondary Technical Education Determined
　　The First National Secondary Technical Education Conference, which opened in Beijing on June 12th, concluded on June 22nd after ten days of plenary and group discussions.

　　This conference was convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the conference determined that the current implementation guidelines for national secondary technical education are adjustment, consolidation, and development under certain conditions. The conference believes that the primary task at present is to effectively adjust and consolidate the existing 500-plus secondary technical schools to transform and improve them to meet the needs of national construction; however, regions, departments, or schools that meet certain conditions should appropriately develop. The conference reached a consensus on several major issues related to secondary technical education after full discussion. Regarding the academic system of secondary technical education, the conference determined that it should be broadly divided into junior and senior levels, with a focus on developing the senior level, but at present, more junior-level programs need to be established, and a large number of diverse short-term training courses should also be organized to meet the urgent needs of current construction. Regarding the issue of school establishment and specialization, the conference believes that it should gradually move towards specialization and unification; however, in the current situation where production is not yet well-developed, it is necessary to pay attention to cultivating comprehensive talents. Regarding the issue of leadership relations, the conference believes that the education departments and relevant business departments must implement the spirit of unified leadership, division of responsibilities, mutual assistance, and close cooperation to run the schools well. To facilitate the development of schools and the integration of theory and practice, secondary technical schools of all types and levels should, in principle, be transferred to the direct leadership of the business departments; the existing private technical supplementary schools in various places should be strengthened in leadership so that they can meet the needs of actual work. The conference also decided to establish secondary technical education committees in the central government, major administrative regions, provinces, or municipalities directly under the central government to be responsible for studying and handling major issues. The conference believes that absorbing workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres to learn technology and make them the backbone of technical personnel is an important link in cultivating cadres for national production and construction and a powerful guarantee for national industrialization. Based on the above principles and spirit, the conference adopted several draft documents, which were submitted by the Ministry of Education to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

　　The conference also discussed how to properly resettle more than one million higher primary school graduates. The representatives at the conference unanimously agreed that they are a valuable asset of the country and a source of cadres for national construction. The conference decided that relevant departments should organize various short-term training courses, apprentice schools, or adopt methods such as master-apprentice training so that the majority of higher primary school graduates who cannot enter secondary schools can learn a skill and participate in various national construction works.

　　有计划地大量培养国家生产建设干部
    全国中等技术教育实施方针确定
    第一次全国中等技术教育会议，自六月十二日在北京开幕，经过十天的大会与小组会的讨论后，已于六月二十二日闭幕。
    这次会议是由中央人民政府教育部召开的。会议遵照毛主席的指示确定了全国中等技术教育以调整、整顿和有条件地发展为当前的实施方针。会议认为目前首要的任务是对现有五百余所中等技术学校应切实地进行调整、整顿，使之改造提高，以符合于国家建设的需要；但是具备了一定条件的地区、部门或学校则应作适当的发展。会议对于与中等技术教育有关的几个主要问题，经过充分讨论后已取得了一致的意见。关于中等技术教育的学制问题，会议确定大体上分为初级与中级两种，以发展中级的为主，但目前须多办初级的，同时还要大量举办多种多样的短期训练班，以应当前建设的迫切需要。关于设校分科问题，会议认为要逐步走向专门化、单一化；但在目前生产事业还不太发达的情形下，又必需注意培养综合性人才。关于领导关系问题，会议认为教育部门和有关业务部门之间必须贯彻统一领导、分工负责、互相帮助、密切配合的精神，把学校办好。为便于学校的发展，便于理论与实际结合，各类各级中等技术学校以改归业务部门直接领导为原则；对各地现有的私立技术补习学校，应加强领导，使能适合实际工作的需要。会议并决定在中央、各大行政区、省或直辖市分别成立中等技术教育委员会，负责研究处理各项重大问题。会议认为吸收工人、农民及革命干部学习技术使他们成为技术人员中间的骨干是培养国家生产建设干部的重要环节，是国家工业化的有力保证。会议根据上述的原则和精神，通过了几个文件的草案，由教育部报请政务院批准后公布实施。
    会议同时讨论了如何妥善安置百余万高小毕业生问题，会上代表们一致认为他们是国家宝贵的财产，是国家建设干部的源泉。会议决定由有关部门举办各种短期训练班、艺徒学校、或采取师傅带徒弟等方式使广大的不能升入中等学校的高小毕业生能学得一技之长，参加各项国家建设工作。
