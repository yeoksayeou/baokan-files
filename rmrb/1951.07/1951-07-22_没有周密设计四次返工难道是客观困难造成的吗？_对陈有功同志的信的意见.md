    Was the Four-Time Reworking Without Thorough Design Caused by Objective Difficulties?
    — Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong's Letter
    Since June 16th, the People's Daily has continuously published many reports of disastrous losses caused by blind construction in basic construction projects without proper engineering design and has put forward criticisms. However, Comrade Chen Yougong has different opinions, believing that the People's Daily's criticism is "scholars sitting in glass windows, unaware of the difficulty of things." This statement is obviously wrong.
    Let us take a small example from our Shandong Medical College: In the summer of 1950, due to the continuous increase in students, our college, with the approval of higher authorities, added another floor on top of the original student dormitory (originally a flat-roofed warehouse). After valuation, it was contracted to Shandong Construction Engineering Company for a total contract price of over 800 million yuan, equivalent to over one million catties of millet at that time. We paid 80% of the funds to the company before construction began. We believe this project is not considered very small. However, the company neither conducted a correct design of the project in advance nor checked and supervised the construction, only sending an ordinary engineering technician to be responsible for building such a large project. Therefore, from the start of construction to completion, there were a total of four reworkings and work stoppages. Initially, without a good design for the project and without the approval of Jinan Construction Bureau, they blindly started construction. As a result, after four or five days of work, the wall had been built to a height of three or four meters when the city construction bureau found that it did not meet the construction bureau's regulations because it was too close to the road. As a result, the original three or four-meter high wall was torn down and rebuilt. After more than ten days of construction, the Construction Bureau found that the bottom must be reinforced with pillars before another floor could be added, otherwise, there would be a risk of collapse in the future. So, the work was stopped again for more than ten days, and the pillars were reworked. The installation of electric lights and wires was even worse, without good design, and they were subjectively and blindly installed. As a result, a fire was discovered the next day, obviously caused by the improper installation of electric lights and wires. Later, all the wires installed in the whole building were reworked. The toilet water pipes on the entire floor should have been installed with 1.5-inch diameter pipes according to the actual situation, but they were blindly installed with 1-inch diameter pipes, and the water could not flow up. In addition, the toilet was poorly designed, causing the toilet drain to be blocked. Finally, all the water pipes installed through the wall of the entire building were reworked. There are other examples of rework of doors and windows, which are too numerous to list. When it rained, ropes, cement, wood, and so on were all soaked in the yard, and no one managed them. Could this be said to be due to transportation difficulties? Or lack of materials? The waste of this project is really impossible to estimate. The original time limit was thirty days, but it took more than a hundred days to barely complete. From the overall project point of view, it is very unstable. I am afraid that when it rains heavily in summer, the waterway will be narrow and small, and there will be a danger of water flowing into the building, or even a complete rework.
    From the whole project perspective, the main reason is that the responsible cadres of the company did not lead a correct and meticulous design in advance, nor did they personally check it. From the start of construction to the completion, they never went to the construction site once, causing such great losses to state property. This is obviously unrelated to objective reasons. This is a fact before our eyes, can we say that it is also "scholars sitting in glass windows and cannot see clearly"? Can we also say that it is because the budget was not approved late? Although this example cannot be used to see the overall problem, the disastrous consequences caused by the lack of correct engineering design in such basic construction, according to the materials already published in the newspapers, are no longer isolated phenomena. This should arouse enough vigilance among our comrades engaged in basic construction, and we should find out the causes of these tragic losses and correct them effectively.

### 没有周密设计四次返工难道是客观困难造成的吗？——对陈有功同志的信的意见

    没有周密设计四次返工难道是客观困难造成的吗？
    ——对陈有功同志的信的意见
    人民日报自六月十六日起连续登载了许多基本建设中没有正确的工程设计即行盲目施工招致惨痛损失的报道，并提出了批评。但陈有功同志有不同意见，认为人民日报的批评是“学者坐在玻璃窗内不知事情难办”。这种说法显然是错误的。
    就我们山东医学院一个很小的实例来看吧：本院一九五○年夏季因学生不断增加，故经上级批准在原有学生宿舍（原系一座平顶大仓库）上面再加上一层楼，经估价后包给了山东建筑工程公司，总包价八亿余元，当时折合小米达一百余万斤，在未开工前即将经费拨给该公司百分之八十。我们认为这个工程是不算很小的。但该公司既未事前对这个工程进行正确设计，施工时又未检查督促，只派了一个普通的工程技术人员负责建筑这样较大的工程。因此，自开工至完工，先后共返工和停工四次。最初，既未对该工程很好设计，又未经济南市建设局批准，即行盲目开工，结果开工四、五天，墙已垒成三、四公尺高，经市建设局发现，不合建设局的规定，靠马路太近，结果把原垒起三、四公尺高的墙拆去重新垒。施工十余天后，又经建设局发现下面须加大柱，方可加一层楼，否则将来会有倒塌的危险。于是又停工十余天，重新返工加柱。电灯电线的按装更没有很好的设计，主观盲目地按装了，结果第二天即发现有起火的地方，这显然是电灯电线按的不妥当所致，后又将全楼按好的电线，全部返工。整个楼上的厕所自来水，本来按实际情况须装一寸半口径的水管，但盲目地装了一寸口径的水管，自来水流不上去；再加厕所设计不好，致使厕所水道不通。最后，终于把通过全楼的墙所按好的水管全部返工。还有其他门窗等返工的例子，不胜列举。下雨时绳子洋灰木料等等，都在院子里淋着，也无一人管理。难道这还能说是运输有困难吗？材料不充裕吗？这工程的浪费实在无法统计。原定期限为三十天，但至今百余天才勉强完工。从总的工程来讲是很不稳固的，恐怕夏天下大雨时，由于水道既窄又小，会有将水流在楼里的危险，甚至有全部返工的危险。
    从这整个工程来讲，主要由于该公司负责干部事前既未负责地领导正确细致设计，又未亲自检查，自开工至完工，从未到工程地点去过一次，给国家财产造成这样大的损失。这显然与客观原因无关。这是摆在我们眼前的事实，难道能说也是“学者坐在玻璃窗内看不真切”吗？难道这还能说是因为预算迟迟没有批下来吗？虽然不能拿这个例子看全面问题，但像这样基本建设中没正确工程设计所招致惨痛损失的恶果，据报上现已登载的材料看来，已不是个别的现象了。这万分应该引起我们做基本建设工作的同志们足够警惕，应把这些惨痛损失找出原因来切实纠正。
