Shanxi Province Before and After the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement
(Special Correspondent Shi Jiyan)

	Before the Launch of the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement

	Shanxi Province also had a "boundless leniency" bias in implementing the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Since the liberation of Taiyuan in the spring of 1949, the open forces of the reactionaries had been overthrown throughout the province, but the hidden counter-revolutionary remnants had not been eliminated. In the countryside—in areas where land reform was implemented in 1949 and 1950—the landlord class did not bow its head. Secret agents, local bullies, habitual bandits, bandit leaders, and reactionary sectarian leaders, using Yiguandao, scattered former military officers, and the landlord class as their social foundation, engaged in various counter-revolutionary activities. Especially after the outbreak of the Korean War in June of last year, counter-revolutionary elements became rampant, spreading rumors and engaging in sabotage without regard for the law. In July of last year, the Yiguandao sect fabricated and spread the rumor of "cutting off testicles and wombs," which spread to twenty or thirty counties in northern Shanxi, lasting for two or three months and affecting the production and social order of the masses. At the same time, the Tuncun County in Changzhi Prefecture, an old liberated area, witnessed the tragic case of Cui Chengzhuang, a local bully and landlord, poisoning the entire family of peasant Li Fuchang. In November, an armed riot occurred in Jishan County, where more than 100 counter-revolutionary armed personnel of the pseudo "Chinese National Volunteer Army" attacked the Jishan County town and the Fifth District government, killing ten of our cadres and people. These examples illustrate how rampant counter-revolutionary activities were. Of course, this does not mean that the counter-revolutionary forces were so powerful. The problem lies in the paralysis of our cadres' thinking and the "boundless leniency" bias in implementing the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The masses were very dissatisfied with this situation.

	Giving a Serious Blow to Counter-Revolutionary Elements

	Since November of last year, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, in accordance with the instructions of the Central People's Government and accepting the demands of the people, has corrected its policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Under the slogan of striking at the current activities of counter-revolutionaries and settling some historical blood debts, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement began. This February, the Central People's Government promulgated the Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, and since April, it has vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries. Shanxi has achieved great success in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Generally speaking, these achievements are: striking the enemy, mobilizing the masses, uniting the people of all classes, educating the cadres, promoting various tasks, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

	This suppression of counter-revolutionaries has dealt a heavy blow to counter-revolutionary elements. A large number of counter-revolutionaries were arrested throughout the province, and dozens of counter-revolutionary organizations were uncovered. Those who committed heinous crimes and refused to repent were sentenced to death. As a result, the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries has been greatly reduced. Except for a few die-hards who are still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, most feel that they have no way out and have to bow to the people. In the newly liberated areas, reactionary landlords who were unwilling to vacate the houses they had seized from the peasants in the past or hand over the red deeds now voluntarily vacated the houses and sent the red deeds, and swept the floors, letting the peasants move in. Some begged the masses for mercy from door to door. Landlords and scattered military officers who did not work also quickly took off their glasses and leather shoes and went to work in the fields. Some counter-revolutionary elements in the Yuncheng and Linfen areas expressed their willingness to atone for their crimes by rendering meritorious service, handing over hidden guns, and assisting the People's Government in arresting heinous counter-revolutionary elements. Many backlog cases have also been solved in various places. For example, the three main culprits who persecuted female Communist Party member Liu Hulan in 1946—Xu Desheng, Zhang Quanbao, and Hou Yuyin—although they changed their names and hid in various places, Xu was finally arrested and executed in Qixian County, and Zhang and Hou were arrested in Wanquan County one after another and escorted to Liu Hulan's tomb for execution. Linfen executed the bandits who had been harming the Jindian Village area. The masses happily said: "The problem that has not been solved since the Qing Dynasty has been solved!" From the perspective of social order, theft and robbery cases have been greatly reduced, and the once rampant rumors have almost disappeared. In the areas that were liberated later, people no longer pick up lost items on the road, and doors are not locked at night. No wonder an old gentleman exclaimed: "The world of Yao and Shun is just like this!"

	This is the People's Democratic Dictatorship

	During this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the people were all elated and applauded. They thanked Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, saying, "The Communist Party has avenged us." However, it is not enough if we only see how the masses cheer for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The masses not only actively support the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but also actively participated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a mass movement on a provincial scale, or more precisely, a people's democratic dictatorship movement. The people, in the capacity of masters of the country, took up the weapons of the regime and exercised dictatorship over the counter-revolutionary elements. Is this not a concrete manifestation of the people's democratic dictatorship? Through the propaganda and education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the masses deeply realized the truth that the front is fighting the U.S. military and the rear is digging up the U.S. roots. Therefore, they actively assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

	The participation of the masses in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is manifested in the following five aspects: 1. Accusations, 2. Denunciations, 3. Arrests, 4. Public trials, 5. Control. The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government received more than 2,000 letters from the masses denouncing counter-revolutionaries in April. Countless mass rallies of more than 10,000 people were held throughout the province to publicly try counter-revolutionary elements. Many people carried dry food on their backs and went to other provinces to arrest counter-revolutionary elements. Cadres in areas where land reform was implemented after 1949 generally reflected that the mobilization of the masses in this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, in terms of scale and depth, surpassed the land reform. Before the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, many liberated peasants in these areas were still afraid of "changing the sky." They said: "We have been liberated, but our arms and legs are not stretched out." After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the thought of fearing change was swept away. The masses said: "When we are asleep, the enemy becomes a tiger; when we wake up, he becomes a sheep." They also wrote their own allegro, expressing their determination and confidence: "Men and women stand up together, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries; whoever dares to make trouble again, resolutely suppress without mercy." The high political consciousness of the masses can be seen from this.

	The Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Promoted Various Tasks

	The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement not only severely struck the enemy and greatly mobilized the masses, but also promoted various tasks.

	The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a great education for the cadres, awakening them from varying degrees of the thought of peace in the world, relaxation and paralysis, and even retreat and replacement, and leading the masses to actively fight. Some cadres who had already returned home wrote to their superiors requesting to work again. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement was carried out on the basis of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and was closely integrated.

	The suppression of counter-revolutionaries played a great role in promoting various tasks and uniting the people internally. This year's "May Day" demonstration involved six million people throughout the province. In fact, this was a convergence of two high tides: resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Various places generally reported that the masses' enthusiasm for production was very high, and the task of planting cotton was overfulfilled. The reason is simple: the peasant masses dared to cultivate and fertilize the land they had been allocated in the same way as their original land. In the past, it was difficult to convene mass meetings and cadre meetings in many villages. Now, not only are the cadres active, but the masses also take the initiative to request meetings. In the past, winter schools developed unevenly. This year, people's schools have generally developed, because people's schools have become the best places to discuss resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The Youth League and the militia have developed greatly, and the thought of the militia laying down their weapons has been swept away. The unity of the people has been further consolidated, and the problems of the relationship between middle and poor peasants left over from the land reform period have been basically resolved in some areas. The relationship between the masses and the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the cadres has become closer. They said: "After the counter-revolutionary elements are shot, we will do whatever the government tells us to do in the future."

	Continue to Carry Out the Movement to Love the Country and Defend Against Traitors

	Although counter-revolutionary elements have been severely hit, a small number of die-hard elements are still carrying out retaliatory sabotage activities. Therefore, we must prevent complacency and arrogance among cadres and the masses. At the same time, we should further educate the people, must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance, continue to carry out the movement to love the country and defend against traitors, and regularize the work of preventing spies.

　　山西省镇压反革命运动前后
    （本报特约记者史纪言）
  在镇压反革命运动开展以前
    山西省在执行镇压反革命政策上，也是存在过“宽大无边”的偏向的。自从一九四九年春天太原解放以后，在全省范围内，反动派的公开势力已经打倒了，但是暗藏的反革命残余却没有肃清。在农村——一九四九年、一九五○年实行土地改革的地区，地主阶级并未低头。特务、恶霸、惯匪、土匪头子及反动道首，利用一贯道、流散旧军官、地主阶级作社会基础，进行种种反革命活动。特别是从去年六月朝鲜战争爆发以后，反革命分子气焰嚣张，活动猖獗，造谣破坏，无法无天。去年七月，一贯道所制造传播的“割旦、割子宫”的谣言，蔓延晋北二、三十县，持续两三个月，影响了群众的生产和社会治安。同时，老解放区长治专区的屯留县发生了恶霸地主崔成庄毒死农民李福昌全家四口的惨案。十一月，稷山县发生了武装暴乱，反革命武装伪“中国国民自愿军”一百余人袭击我稷山县城及五区区政府，杀死我干部群众十人。从这几个例子，可以看出反革命活动是如何猖獗。当然，这并不是说反革命力量如何强大，而问题之所在，是由于我们干部思想的麻痹，在执行镇压反革命政策上，存在“宽大无边”的偏向。对于这种情况，群众是十分不满意的。
  给予反革命分子以严重打击
    从去年十一月起，山西省人民政府按照中央人民政府的指示，并接受人民的要求，端正了镇压反革命政策。在打击反革命现行活动、清算某些历史血债的口号下，开始了镇压反革命运动。今年二月中央人民政府颁布惩治反革命条例，四月起大张旗鼓镇压反革命，山西的镇压反革命工作取得了巨大的成绩。这种成绩，概括地讲来，就是：打击了敌人，发动了群众，团结了各阶层人民，教育了干部，推动了各种工作，巩固了人民民主专政。
    这次镇压反革命，给予反革命分子的打击是沉重的，在全省范围内捉了大批反革命分子，破获了反革命组织达数十种，其中罪大恶极、怙恶不悛的，都处以死刑。因而，反革命气焰大为降低。除少数死硬分子仍在进行反革命活动外，大部分感到走头无路，不得不向人民低头。在新解放区，反动地主不肯把过去霸占的农民的房子腾出来，也不交红契；现在，他们自行腾房送红契，并且糊窗扫地，让农民往里搬，有的则挨门挨户向群众求饶。不事劳动的地主和流散军官，也赶快摘下眼镜，脱下皮鞋，上地劳动。运城、临汾地区某些反革命分子，向政府表示愿意立功赎罪，交出暗藏枪枝，并协助人民政府捉拿罪大恶极的反革命分子。各地并且破获了许多积案。如一九四六年残害女共产党员刘胡兰同志的三个主要凶犯——徐得胜、张全宝、侯雨寅，虽然改名埋姓，潜藏各地，但徐犯终于在祁县被捕伏法，张侯两犯先后在万泉县被捕，押解到刘胡兰同志墓前伏法。临汾枪毙了为害金殿村一带的土匪，群众高兴地说：清朝以来没有解决的问题解决了。从社会治安来看，偷盗抢劫案件大为减少了，曾经猖獗一时的谣言几乎绝迹了。在解放较晚的地区，也是路不拾遗，夜不闭户了。无怪乎有一位老先生感叹地说：“尧舜之世，不过如此！”
        这是人民民主专政
    此次镇压反革命，人民群众无不扬眉吐气、拍手称快。他们感谢毛主席，感谢共产党和人民政府，都说：“共产党给我们报了仇了。”但是，如果我们只看到群众对于镇压反革命如何欢呼，那是很不够的。群众不但积极地拥护镇压反革命，而且积极参加了镇压反革命。此次镇压反革命，是一个全省规模的群众运动，更确切地说，是一个人民民主专政运动。人民群众以国家主人翁的资格，拿起政权的武器，对反革命分子实行专政。这难道不是人民民主专政的具体表现吗？经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命的宣传教育，群众深刻地认识到前方打美军，后方挖美根这一真理。因而积极起来协助政府镇压反革命。
    群众参加镇压反革命工作，表现在下列五个方面：一、控诉，二、检举，三、捉拿，四、公审，五、管制。太原市人民政府在四月份接到群众检举反革命的信件就有两千多件。全省各地召开了无数个万人以上的群众公审反革命分子大会。不少群众，自己背上干粮，到外省捉拿反革命分子。在一九四九年以后实行土地改革的地区的干部，普遍反映：此次镇压反革命，对于群众的发动，从规模和深度上说，都超过了土地改革。在镇压反革命运动以前，这些地区有不少翻身农民还怕“变天”。他们说：翻了身，但是胳膊腿儿不舒展，镇压反革命运动以后，怕变天的思想一扫而空了。群众说：“咱们睡了觉，敌人就成了老虎，咱们醒了，他就变成了羊。”他们并且自编快板，表示决心和信心：“男男女女一齐站起来，坚决镇压反革命；谁要再敢来捣乱，坚决镇压不留情。”群众政治觉悟之高，可以看出一斑。
        镇压反革命推动了各种工作
    镇压反革命运动，不但严重地打击了敌人，大大地发动了群众，而且推动了各种工作。
    镇压反革命，对于干部的教育是很大的，使他们从不同程度的天下太平、松懈麻痹、甚至退坡换班的思想中惊醒起来，领导群众积极战斗起来。有些已经回家的干部，给上级写信要求重新工作。镇压反革命运动是在抗美援朝运动的基础上开展的，而且又是紧密结合进行的。
    镇压反革命，对于各种工作的推动，对于人民内部的团结，起了很大的推动作用。今年“五一”大示威，全省参加者达六百万人。实际上这是抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动两个高潮的汇合。各地普遍反映：群众生产情绪十分高涨，植棉任务超额完成。道理很简单，农民群众敢在分下的土地上和自己原有的土地上一样地加工上肥了。过去有不少村庄召开群众会、干部会都很困难，现在不但干部积极，群众也是主动要求开会；过去冬学发展不平衡，今年民校普遍发展了，因为民校已成为讨论抗美援朝和镇压反革命的最好场所。青年团和民兵都有很大发展，民兵放下武器的思想为之一扫。人民群众内部的团结更加巩固，若干地区在土地改革时期遗留下的中贫农关系问题，基本上得到解决了。群众和共产党、人民政府、干部的关系更加密切了。他们说：枪毙了反革命分子，今后政府叫我们干啥就干啥。
  继续开展爱国防奸运动
    反革命分子虽然已经受到十分沉重的打击，但是一小部分死心塌地的分子仍在进行报复破坏活动。因此，我们必须防止干部、群众中的麻痹思想和骄傲自满情绪。同时，我们应该进一步教育人民，必须继续保持高度警觉，继续开展爱国防奸运动，把防奸细工作经常化。
