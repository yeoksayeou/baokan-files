Some Students of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee School of the CCP
Gained Greatly from Studying "On Practice"
　　Among the 271 students studying theory at the Hebei Provincial Party Committee School of the CCP, 44 had a middle school education, 182 had a higher elementary school education, and 45 were equivalent to elementary school graduates. They began studying "On Practice" on March 28 this year, lasting for two months, and gained a lot.
　　Before studying "On Practice," Comrade Yin Yigang, a responsible comrade of the Party School, lectured on the basic principles of dialectical materialism, enabling students to establish a dialectical materialist worldview in their thinking, oppose empiricism and dogmatism, and transform their ways of thinking. Then, Comrade Xue Xun, Minister of the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, lectured on "On Practice." Concrete facts were used to illustrate the basic principles during the lectures.
　　At the beginning of the study, many students believed that "philosophy is mysterious, abstract, invisible, intangible, and not easy to understand." "Studying this doesn't help me," "it's not useful in work," "the content is too deep, and it's a waste of time to study it for a long time without understanding it." In response to these ideological situations, leading comrades made further mobilizations, explaining the importance of studying "On Practice," and especially pointing out that Chairman Mao's "On Practice" itself is a theory summarized and elevated from the practical experience of revolutionary struggle, and it is easy to understand as long as it is combined with actual struggles. In this way, students began to feel that "philosophy is not mysterious, and philosophical principles are contained in daily life and work." Some also believed that "after studying "On Practice," fewer mistakes will be made in work." The students' enthusiasm for learning also rose.
　　After this study, the students realized that "this is a great revolution in thinking methods, and this is the most rewarding course in learning." Everyone's understanding of the course can be seen from the final test scores: a total of 263 people took the exam, 179 got A, 50 got B, 27 got C, and only 7 got D. The vast majority of the results were excellent.
　　What are some of the main gains?
　　First of all, it made everyone more clearly aware of what a dialectical materialist worldview is, and cleared away the remnants of superstition and fatalism. From study and discussion, it can be seen that most of the students still had remnants of superstition and fatalistic thinking due to the reactionary ideological education of feudalism in the past. After this study, they realized that all objective things and subjective thinking have their own laws of development. Any comrade, as long as they have a firm stand and work and study hard, can make progress. And they realized that revolution and construction are to transform this material world.
　　Secondly, everyone understood that "everything changes with time, place, and conditions," and began to recognize the general laws of the development of things, and began to have foresight and initiative in their work. And realized that to look at problems comprehensively; don't just see the shortcomings, but also see the advantages; don't just see your own department, but also see the whole. Some said in their self-criticism: In the past, due to the one-sidedness and subjectivity of thinking methods, many mistakes occurred when dealing with problems. Others said in their self-criticism: I only cared about completing the task, regardless of the method, which caused great losses to our work. More importantly, everyone realized that they must be good at accepting new things, strengthen learning, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strive to improve forward. At the same time, they also realized that things are developing, and they must look at problems from a developmental perspective.
　　Thirdly, it criticized the errors of dogmatism and empiricism that severed perceptual knowledge from rational knowledge, especially the error of empiricism. It made everyone realize that the basic reason for encountering setbacks in work is that the subjective does not meet the objective requirements. The vast majority of the students were from peasant backgrounds. The sluggishness and conservatism of small-scale peasant production are reflected in the Party, manifesting the errors of dogmatism and empiricism in work; coupled with the low cultural and theoretical level of the general students, and the long-term exposure to the decentralized rural environment, empiricism in work is even more serious. After studying, on the one hand, it criticized the dogmatic error of mechanically copying the instructions of higher authorities regardless of the actual situation, such as some self-criticism said: "Without considering the specific situation, I once arranged well-drilling work in villages with good irrigation conditions." Some self-criticisms revealed: Arranging women's weaving work in the city, which was opposed by the masses; some always believed that "work experience can solve problems, and books cannot solve problems." As well as neglecting to summarize work and other biases. Understood that practice is the leap of the initiative of theory, without revolutionary theory there would be no revolutionary movement, and practice without theoretical guidance is blind practice. After raising awareness, some hated that they had not studied enough in the past, and were determined to study hard in the future.
　　Fourthly, it criticized the "left" and right errors of cognition departing from practice, especially the right error of cognition lagging behind practice, and recognized the importance of transforming the subjective world. Generally, students realized that cognition exceeding the current reality and exceeding a certain stage of development of the objective process would commit "left" adventurous errors, such as infringing on industry and commerce and infringing on the interests of middle peasants in some places in the past. At the same time, it also criticized the right error of cognition lagging behind practice, making everyone realize that the phenomenon of lagging behind practice is particularly obvious in the period of historical transformation. In the current new situation of the revolution, many comrades have not developed with the development of reality, and their understanding is still stuck in the old stage, such as some are dissatisfied with the Party's united front policy; some are burdened with the merits of heroes, complaining that the Party does not promote themselves, only feel that they cannot get along, and do not humbly learn; some are dissatisfied with repairing cement roads and building toilets, thinking that roads can be walked without repairing cement roads, and shit can be done without building toilets. In this study, everyone has realized from the ideological point of view that it is wrong to complain about the Party, and the main reason is that their own understanding cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation; thus, they also realized the importance of transforming the subjective world and the importance of rectifying the Party.
　　Finally, everyone understood the truth that contradictions can only be resolved by exposing contradictions; mistakes can only be corrected by admitting mistakes, and wanting to "secretly correct them" is a self-deceiving method. Within the Party, unity should be achieved through struggle, not a harmonious unity. Class enemies must be resolutely struggled against, not extinguishing or concealing this struggle but struggling to the end. Reformism, class conciliationism, and right capitulationism must be opposed.
　　Two months of study has been very rewarding, but there are still a few students who have dogmatic learning methods and some uneasy learning emotions, so this gain is not universal.

### 中共河北省委党校部分学员  学习《实践论》有很大收获

　　中共河北省委党校部分学员
  学习《实践论》有很大收获
    中共河北省委党校中学习理论的学员二百七十一名，其中中学程度者四十四名，高小者一百八十二名，相当初小毕业者四十五名。他们从今年三月二十八日开始学习《实践论》，历时两月，收获很大。
    在学习《实践论》之前，曾由党校负责同志阴一刚讲授辩证法唯物论的基本法则，使学员在思想上树立起辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，反对经验主义与教条主义，改造思想方法。接着就由河北省委组织部薛迅部长讲《实践论》。讲授时都用具体事实来说明基本原理。
    学习开始时，有许多学员认为“哲学是神秘的，抽象的，看不见捉不住的，不容易理解。”“学这个对自己没帮助”，“工作中用不上”，“内容太深，学半天弄不通，白耽误时间”。领导同志针对这些思想情况，又作了动员，说明学习实践论的重要性，并特别说明了毛主席的《实践论》本身就是从实际的革命斗争经验概括上升的理论，只要和实际斗争结合，是很容易懂得的。这样学员开始感到“哲学并不神秘，在日常生活和工作中都包含着哲学的道理”。也有的相信“学习《实践论》后，工作会少犯些错误”。学员的学习情绪也就高涨起来。
    经过这次学习以后，学员们都认识到“这是思想方法上的一次大革命，这是学习中收获最大的一门课程”。大家对课程的理解，可从期终的测验成绩中看出来：参加考试的共二百六十三人，甲等一百七十九人，乙等五十人，丙等二十七人，丁等仅七人，绝大多数成绩是优良的。
    有些什么主要的收获呢？
    首先使大家更加明确认识了什么是辩证唯物主义的宇宙观，肃清了迷信及宿命论的思想残余。从学习讨论中看到：大多数学员由于过去曾受到封建主义的反动思想教育，因此还有迷信及宿命论思想的残余。经过这次学习以后，他们认识到一切客观事物及主观的思维都有其自身发展的规律。任何同志，只要立场坚决，好好工作和学习，是可以进步的。并且认识到革命和建设就是要改造这个物质世界。
    其次，大家懂得了“一切以时间、地点、条件为转移”，开始认识到事物发展的一般规律，对工作开始有了预见性和主动性。并认识到，看问题要全面；不要只看到缺点，也要看到优点；不要只看到自己部门，也要看到整体。有的在检讨时说：以往由于思想方法之片面性、主观性，因之处理问题时发生了许多错误。还有的检讨说：光管完成任务，不管方式如何，使我们工作受到很大损失。更重要的是大家认识到要善于接受新鲜事物，要加强学习和开展批评自我批评，努力提高向前。同时还认识到事物是发展的，要从发展观点上去看问题。
    再次，批判了割裂感性知识与理性知识的教条主义与经验主义的错误，特别是经验主义的错误。使大家认识了工作碰壁的基本原因是主观不符合客观要求。学员中绝大多数是农民出身。农民小生产的散慢性、保守性反映到党内来，在工作中表现了教条主义与经验主义的错误；加上一般学员文化理论水平低，又长期处在分散的农村环境，工作中的经验主义更为严重。学习后，一方面批判了不顾实际情况硬搬上级指示的教条主义错误，如有的检讨说：“不根据具体情况，我曾经在水利灌溉条件较好的村庄布置打井工作。”有的检讨出：在城市中布置妇女纺织工作，因而遭到群众反对；有的总认为“工作经验能解决问题，书本子不解决问题”。以及轻视总结工作等偏向。了解了实践是理论能动性之飞跃，没有革命的理论就不会有革命的运动，没有理论指导之实践是盲目的实践。提高认识后，有的恨自己过去学习不够，下决心要在今后好好学习。
    再次，批判了认识脱离实践的“左”倾与右倾的错误，特别是认识了落后于实践的右倾错误，认清了改造主观世界之重要性。一般学员均认识到认识超过当前的现实性及超过客观过程的一定发展阶段，便会犯“左”倾冒险主义错误，如过去有些地方侵犯工商业、侵犯中农利益等。同时也批判了认识落后于实践的右倾错误，使大家认识到落后于实践的现象在历史转变的时期表现得特别明显。在目前革命的新形势下，有许多同志没有随着实际的发展而发展，认识还停留在旧的阶段上，如有的对党的统一战线政策不满；有的背着功臣包袱，埋怨党不提拔自己，只觉得自己吃不开了，而不虚心学习；有的不满意修洋灰马路、盖厕所，认为马路不修成洋灰路也一样可以走，不盖厕所也能拉屎。这次学习中，大家已从思想上认识了埋怨党是不对的，主要是自己的认识赶不上形势发展的需要；从而也认识了改造主观世界的重要性，认识了整风整党之重要性。
    最后，大家懂得了只有暴露矛盾才能解决矛盾的道理；只有承认错误才能改正错误，想“自己偷着改了”是自欺欺人的办法。在党内，要从斗争中取得一致，而不是一团和气的团结。对阶级敌人要坚决地进行斗争，不是熄灭或掩饰这个斗争而是斗争到底。必须反对改良主义、阶级调和主义和右倾投降主义。
    两个月的学习，是有很大收获的，但仍有少数学员存有教条主义的学习方法和某些不安心学习的情绪，因此这种收获还是不普遍的。
