Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: General Kim Il-sung, Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, sent a notice to Ridgway agreeing to hold ceasefire negotiations, which has aroused strong reactions among the U.S. soldiers invading Korea. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 2nd, "A strong hope for peace has entered the minds of the United Nations soldiers fighting in Korea. The soldiers are unreservedly accepting the Chinese Communists' proposal to hold ceasefire negotiations in Kaesong." Because "ceasefire" is precisely "what the U.S. soldiers, who are tired of war," "have been hoping for." "The (U.S.) soldiers who have experienced the Korean soil, heavy rain, cold, and filth," "always show a hopeful light on their faces when eagerly awaiting every piece of news from the rear."

According to the United States News Service, when Private Barnes heard the news, he "smiled so much that he couldn't close his mouth." He said, "God, I hope so, it's really time. The ceasefire should be as soon as possible. No one wants to be the last to die in this war." Corporal Powell said, "We can't get anything from here, we should end this war, and it should be now!" Private Lincoln Harbor, "who has been wounded twice" in the war of aggression against Korea, also urgently demanded a ceasefire "with a resentful tone."

According to the Associated Press, "The same desire can also be seen near the front lines. There, the infantry often asks: When will I go home?"

The United States News Service admitted that anti-war sentiment is rapidly growing among the U.S. invading soldiers, "each of whom has determined" that continuing to sacrifice in the war of aggression is "meaningless."

　　侵朝美军士兵迫切要求停战
    厌战情绪迅速增长
    【新华社四日讯】朝鲜人民军总司令金日成将军和中国志愿军司令员彭德怀将军向李奇微发出的同意举行停战谈判的通知，已经在侵朝美军的士兵中引起了强烈的反应。据美联社二日电透露：“浓厚的要求和平的希望进入了在朝鲜作战的联合国兵士的脑海。兵士们正无保留地接受共军所提出的在开城举行停火谈判的建议。”因为，“停火”正是“过厌了战争生活的”侵朝美军士兵们“所一直盼望的东西”。“经历过朝鲜的泥土、大雨、寒冷和污秽的（美军）兵士”，“眼巴巴地等待着后方来的每一条消息时，脸上总流露出希望的光彩。”
    据美国国新社透露：美军的一等兵巴恩斯听到这个消息时，“笑得连嘴吧都合不拢了”，他说：“天哪，我希望如此，的确是时候了。停火应该愈快愈好。没有人想在这次战争中做一个最后的送死鬼。”下士鲍威尔说：“我们从这里什么也捞不到，我们应该结束这个战争，而且现在就该如此！”在侵朝战争中“两度挂彩的一等兵林何浦的话里带着怨愤的口气”，他同样迫切地要求停战。
    另据美联社称：“在接近前线的地方，也能看到同样的这种热望。在那里的步兵常常发问道：我到什么时候才回家？”
    国新社承认，厌战情绪正在美国侵略军士兵中迅速增长，“他们每个人都断定”：继续在侵略战争中牺牲，是“没有什么意义”的。
