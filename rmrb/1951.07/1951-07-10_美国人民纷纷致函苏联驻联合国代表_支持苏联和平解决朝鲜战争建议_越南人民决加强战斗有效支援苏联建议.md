　　American People Write to Soviet UN Representative Supporting Soviet Proposal for Peaceful Resolution of Korean War
    Vietnamese People Resolve to Strengthen Combat and Effectively Support Soviet Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch] TASS, New York, 8th dispatch: In the past few days, the Soviet representative to the United Nations has received a large number of letters and telegrams from American workers, office staff, farmers, students and various popular groups. They all warmly support the Soviet proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War, expressing their unwavering will to strive for peace and international cooperation and friendship, and denouncing the aggressive policies of the American ruling groups who want to launch another world war.
    Graber, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, wrote: "The American people are very eager for peace and will fight every day to end the war. ... There is no doubt that the American people will support your peace proposals and will assist in achieving victory in this regard."
    Twenty-two members of the Harlem branch of the American Labor Party wrote to the Soviet representative, saying: We are convinced that the capitalist system and the communist system can coexist in the world. We workers and all black people are eager to stop the senseless bloody war in Korea. Therefore, after reading and studying your proposal, we fully support it.
    Hinki, a resident of Grand Island, Nebraska, sent his article to the Soviet representative to the United Nations, saying that the local newspaper, The Independent, refused to publish it. In his article, Hinki wrote: The United Nations has no legal or moral right to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea. The Korean War is an internal matter for the Koreans themselves. ... Based on historical facts, the United Nations appears to be the real aggressor against Korea. Hinki concluded his article by saying: The Korean War must end immediately.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch] According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese Labor Party’s newspaper "People" Weekly published an editorial on July 5, endorsing the Soviet peace proposal. The editorial wrote: The Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue demonstrates its initiative in international diplomacy. This Soviet proposal has placed the US imperialists in a dilemma. The United States has only two paths to take. One is to reject this proposal and further expose its true face as a war provoker in the face of world opinion; the other is to sincerely accept the Soviet proposal. In this way, the Korean issue can be resolved, the threat of a third world war can begin to be contained, and the world peace camp will win a major victory.
    The editorial continued: The Vietnamese people, like the people of other countries, warmly welcome and firmly support the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. The Vietnamese people believe that if the peace-loving people of the world actively support the Soviet peace proposals and intensify their struggle against the warmongers, the US imperialists and their servants will be forced to resolve the Korean War peacefully, in accordance with the Soviet proposals. In order to effectively support the Soviet Union's peace proposals, the Vietnamese people have decided to fight even more fiercely than before to defeat the French imperialists and American interventionists who are undermining peace in Vietnam, Korea, and the world.

　　美国人民纷纷致函苏联驻联合国代表
    支持苏联和平解决朝鲜战争建议
    越南人民决加强战斗有效支援苏联建议
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约八日讯：在过去几天中，苏联驻联合国代表接到美国工人、职员、农民、学生和各种民众团体寄来的大量信件和电报。他们全都热烈支持苏联的和平解决朝鲜战争的建议，表示他们争取和平及国际合作与友谊的不屈不挠的意志，并斥责美国统治集团想发动另一次世界大战的侵略政策。
    纽约布鲁克林区居民格拉柏尔写道：“美国人民非常渴望和平，并将天天为争取结束战争而奋斗。……毫无疑问，美国人民将支持你的和平建议，并将协助在这方面获得胜利。”
    美国劳工党哈莱姆支部的二十二名党员写信给苏联代表说：我们确信，资本主义制度和共产主义制度是可以在世界上共存的。我们工人和一切黑人都渴望停止在朝鲜的无谓的血腥战争。因此，在看过了并研究了你的建议以后，我们完全支持这个建议。
    内布拉斯加州大岛市居民辛基把他的文章寄给苏联驻联合国代表，并说，当地的报纸《独立报》拒绝发表这篇文章。辛基在文章中写道：联合国在法律上和道义上都没有权利干涉朝鲜的内政。朝鲜战争是朝鲜人自己的内部事情。……根据历史事实看起来，联合国是对朝鲜的真正侵略者。辛基在他的文章结语中说：朝鲜战争必须马上结束。
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民”周刊七月五日发表社论，拥护苏联的和平建议。社论写道：苏联提出和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，说明了它在国际外交政策上的主动。苏联这一建议，使美帝国主义者处于进退维谷的地位。美国只有两条路可走。一条路是：拒绝这个建议，并在世界舆论面前进一步露出战争挑拨者的真面目；另一条路就是：诚恳地接受苏联的建议。这样，朝鲜问题就可以获得解决，第三次世界大战的威胁就可以开始被抑制下去，世界和平阵营就将获得一次重大的胜利。
    社论继续写道：越南人民与其他国家人民一样，热烈欢迎并坚决支持苏联关于和平解决朝鲜战争的建议。越南人民相信，如果全世界爱好和平的人民积极支持苏联的和平建议，并对战争贩子加紧斗争，美帝国主义者和其仆从们将被迫以和平的途径，依照苏联的建议来解决朝鲜战争。越南人民为了有效地支援苏联的和平建议，决定比以前更要猛烈地作战，以打败在越南、朝鲜和全世界破坏和平的法国帝国主义者和美国干涉分子。
