Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 29th: According to TASS, Sydney, 28th: The movement of the Australian people against the US-made draft peace treaty with Japan and the Pacific Pact is developing enthusiastically. A declaration published by the Australian Committee Against the Re-arming of Japan opposing the re-arming of Japan has already received the support of 15,000 signatures.

The Chairman of the Australian Communist Party, Dixon, pointed out that the US draft peace treaty with Japan "gives Japan unlimited rights to re-arm and allows the fascist militarist groups to regain power. The Pacific Pact is also a deception, its purpose is to launch wars of aggression, not to defend Australia or the peace of the Pacific."

The Executive Committee of the Sydney District of the Australian Communist Party issued a statement saying that the US draft "peace treaty" with Japan and the Pacific Pact are "a serious betrayal of the interests of the Australian people. The so-called Pacific Pact, which aims to prevent possible Japanese aggression, is a deliberately fabricated malicious lie." The statement said: "According to this shameful pact, Australia must participate in all aggressive actions of the atom-crazed American warmongers in the Pacific. This pact will turn Australia into a war base for the United States and a supplier of cannon fodder for American imperialism. It will greatly increase war expenses, raise prices, and make food and necessities even scarcer." The statement pointed out: "For Australia, the road to peace and security does not lie in concluding a war pact with the United States, but in a policy of developing peaceful and good-neighborly relations with all Pacific countries and peoples, such as the Soviet Union and People's China, and in the conclusion of a five-power peace pact by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and People's China." The Executive Committee called on the Australian people to make urgent demands on the Federal Government to reject the US draft peace treaty with Japan and the Pacific Pact, and to conclude a democratic peace between all Allied peoples and the Japanese people.

A mass protest meeting against the re-arming of Japan, initiated by the Committee Against the Re-arming of Japan, was held this week at the Sydney Town Hall. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Australian government refuse to sign the American draft treaty, and resolved to hold a national patriotic protest week against the arming of Japan from August 12th to 18th.

The Chief Secretary of the New South Wales Government, Clive Evatt, said at the meeting: "We protest this unprecedentedly sinful document." He pointed out that the US draft treaty "is not a peace treaty, it is a war treaty. The Japanese people do not want this kind of treaty." He also said that the Pacific Pact did not make any guarantees to Australia, but instead tied Australia to the wheels of American foreign policy. Australian Federal Member of Parliament Ward also asked every Australian to emphasize to their local members of parliament the necessity of opposing the revival of Japanese militarism.

　　不准澳政府在美制对日和约上签字！
　  澳人民坚决反对重新武装日本
　  澳共号召人民抗议与美国缔结战争公约
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社悉尼二十八日讯：澳大利亚人民反对美制对日和约草案和太平洋公约的运动，正在热烈展开中。澳大利亚的反对重新武装日本委员会为反对重新武装日本所发表的宣言，已经获得一万五千人的签名拥护。
    澳大利亚共产党主席狄克逊指出：美国的对日和约草案“给日本以重新武装的无限权利，并使法西斯军国主义集团重新执政。太平洋公约也是一个骗局，它的目的是发动侵略战争，而不是保卫澳大利亚或者太平洋的和平。”
    澳大利亚共产党悉尼区执行委员会发表声明说：美国的对日“和约”草案与太平洋公约是“对澳大利亚人民利益的严重出卖。所谓太平洋公约旨在阻止可能的日本侵略，是一种有意制造出来的恶毒谎言”。声明说：“根据这个可耻的公约，澳大利亚必须参加原子狂的美国战争贩子在太平洋的一切侵略行动。这个公约将把澳大利亚变为美国的战争基地和美帝国主义的炮灰供给地。它将使战费大大地增加，物价高涨，并将使粮食和生活必需品更加缺乏。”声明指出：“对澳大利亚说来，和平与安全的道路不在于与美国缔结战争公约，而是在于与苏联和人民中国等所有太平洋国家和人民发展和平善邻关系的政策，在于英、美、苏、法和人民中国缔结五国和平公约。”执行委员会号召澳大利亚人民向联邦政府提出紧急要求，拒绝美国的对日和约草案和太平洋公约，并在所有盟国人民与日本人民之间缔结民主的和平。
    由反对重新武装日本委员会所发起的反对重新武装日本的群众抗议大会，于本周在悉尼市政厅举行。大会一致通过决议，要求澳大利亚政府拒绝在美国的和约草案上签字，并决议自八月十二日至十八日举行全国反对武装日本爱国抗议周。
    新南威尔士政府主任秘书克烈夫·伊华特在大会上发言说：“我们抗议这个空前罪恶的文件。”他指出：美国的和约草案“不是一个和平条约，它是一个战争条约。日本人民不愿要这种条约”。他又说：太平洋公约并没有向澳大利亚作出什么保证，反而把澳大利亚缚在美国外交政策的车轮上。澳大利亚联邦议会议员华德也要求每一个澳大利亚人向他们本区的议员着重指出反对日本军国主义复活的必要。
