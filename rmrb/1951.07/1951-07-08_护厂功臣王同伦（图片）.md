Model Factory Guard Wang Tonglun

(1) Comrade Wang Tonglun is an electrical worker in the power room of a factory in Shenyang.

(2) During the puppet Manchukuo period, although Wang Tonglun worked in a factory, he lived a life worse than a beast of burden. In 1944, his father fell ill due to being forced to do labor by the puppet village head. Because he had no money for treatment, he died of illness.

(3) After the Kuomintang "took over," he still lived in poverty. In order to support his family, Wang Tonglun became a vegetable vendor. The money he earned from selling vegetables all day was not enough to eat. His mother and sister had to go to the streets to beg.
