　　Beijing Conducts Universal Inspection of Preferential Treatment Work
　  The Lives of Most Families of Revolutionary Martyrs Are Now Guaranteed
　  Decision Made to Mobilize Social Forces to Solve Employment and Other Problems
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently mobilized people from all walks of life to conduct a universal inspection of preferential treatment work in urban areas through visits and solicitations. The inspection first revealed that, after the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movements, the political consciousness of the city's families of revolutionary martyrs has greatly improved. Generally, the families of revolutionary martyrs felt very honored and grateful for the government and people from all walks of life coming to visit them. Many family members of martyrs expressed their intention to immediately write letters to their children or husbands in the Volunteer Army or the People's Liberation Army, encouraging them to bravely kill the enemy and defend the security of the motherland. Many poor family members of martyrs also told the inspection team that although their lives were difficult, the country also had difficulties, and they would definitely try to solve their own livelihood problems. Secondly, this inspection proved that, due to the Municipal People's Government's implementation of the correct policy of "introducing employment and organizing production as the main means, combined with material assistance," the lives of most families of revolutionary martyrs have been basically guaranteed. There are about 25,000 families of revolutionary martyrs and cadres in the city who need material preferential treatment. In the past two and a half years, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau and district offices have introduced employment for 2,517 people, and introduced 6,791 people (some of whom are temporary workers) to participate in production in military family production units. In the past two and a half years, the government has allocated a total of more than 4.347 million catties of millet for preferential treatment. There are a total of 3,553 families of revolutionary martyrs and cadres in the city who are orphans, elderly, disabled, sick, or have too many children and are unable to support themselves, enjoying long-term material preferential treatment. The rest are subsidized by the Municipal People's Government before they obtain employment or other sources of income sufficient to maintain their lives. In 1950, the Municipal People's Government helped more than 1,200 children of families of revolutionary martyrs and cadres solve the problem of entering or advancing in schools.
    However, through this universal inspection, the following problems were found to exist in the city's preferential treatment work: First, because the publicity and education work for preferential treatment work in the past was not done well enough, some cadres and the masses still have incorrect understandings of preferential treatment work. The most common is that cadres in the civil affairs departments mistakenly believe that preferential treatment work is just simple administrative work; the general public believes that this is the responsibility of the government's civil affairs department, and therefore does not respect the families of revolutionary martyrs enough. For example, the landlord of No. 19 Shifangyuan in the First District deliberately did not collect rent for half a year, and filed a lawsuit in court, ordering the military family to move out within a time limit. Staff at a municipal hospital said to a military family member who was seeing a doctor: "You are a military family member, go to the government, it has nothing to do with us." These things aroused public dissatisfaction, and some people said: "Citizens do not respect military family members, and the government does not think of ways." Second, the living problems of families of revolutionary martyrs have not been fully and effectively resolved, and there are omissions and delays in the distribution of preferential treatment grain, so some families of revolutionary martyrs often go to the district office to ask for relief. Among these families of revolutionary martyrs with livelihood difficulties, many are able to work. They generally do not want to enjoy preferential treatment and hope to find employment to avoid increasing the burden on the people. During this inspection, more than 3,400 people made such requests. Most of them lack production technology, have low levels of education, or are elderly intellectuals, making it more difficult to find employment. However, in the past, the government did not find employment for some people who had the conditions for employment. For example, many people have been asking for nannies in the past three months, and some district cadres always say that there is no one, but this inspection found that there are 21 military family members in the Second District who want to do this kind of work. Third, the housing problem of poor families of revolutionary martyrs is a serious problem. There are 221 families of revolutionary martyrs in the city who have no housing, most of whom were evicted by landlords. There are 341 families who are unable to repair their houses. Fourth, when poor families of revolutionary martyrs suffer from acute or serious illnesses and need to be hospitalized, due to the limited preferential treatment funds and the insufficient allocation of beds in municipal hospitals, no appropriate solution has yet been found. Fifth, there are still more than 1,500 children of families of revolutionary martyrs in the city who are unable to enter or advance in schools.
    Through this inspection, Beijing has gained a more comprehensive understanding of the situation of preferential treatment work. This inspection has been successful; however, some civil affairs cadres in the districts have not made deep enough inspections of their own work and thinking, so they cannot effectively correct the shortcomings and errors in their past work. Secondly, this inspection work was also done relatively roughly. This is mainly because some district offices did not clearly explain to the personnel participating in the inspection work. The inspection staff were very enthusiastic, but most lacked experience, so some people forgot to specify the family situation of the family of revolutionary martyrs during the inspection, or did not specify how many people were requesting employment and schooling, what kind of employment they were requesting, and what kind of school they wanted to enter. Because the inspection materials are not specific, it is difficult to effectively help the families of revolutionary martyrs solve their difficulties.
    In order to further improve the work of preferential treatment, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, in addition to having discussed with the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and resolved the issue of children of families of revolutionary martyrs entering and advancing in schools, has now decided to mobilize social forces to organize a three-level preferential treatment work committee at the municipal, district, and police station levels to gradually solve the problems of life, housing, disease treatment, and employment for poor families of revolutionary martyrs.

### 北京普遍检查优抚工作  目前大部分烈军属的生活已有保障  决定动员社会力量解决就业等问题

　　北京普遍检查优抚工作
　  目前大部分烈军属的生活已有保障
　  决定动员社会力量解决就业等问题
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府最近动员各界人民以拜访慰问的方式，普遍检查了城区的优抚工作。在检查中首先发现，经过抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动，全市烈军属的政治觉悟已大大提高。一般烈军属对于这次政府和各界人民前来访问感到非常光荣，表示感谢。许多军属表示要立即写信给志愿军或解放军中的子女或丈夫，鼓励他们英勇杀敌和保卫祖国的安全。许多贫苦的烈军属还对检查组的工作人员说，他们的生活虽然困难，但是国家也有困难，他们一定要努力设法解决自己的生活问题。其次，这次的检查证明，由于市人民政府对于优抚工作执行了以“介绍职业和组织生产为主结合实物补助”的正确方针，大部分烈军属的生活已基本上得到保障。全市需要实物优待的烈军属和干部家属约两万五千多人，两年半来经市民政局和各区公所介绍就业的有两千五百一十七人，介绍参加军属生产单位生产的有六千七百九十一人（有一部分是临时工）。两年半来，政府共拨出优待粮小米四百三十四万七千多斤。全市共有孤、老、残、病和小孩过多无力自养的烈军属和干部家属三千五百五十三人，享受着长期实物优待。其余的在未获得职业或其他足以维持生活的经济来源之前，均由市人民政府予以补助。一九五○年，市人民政府帮助烈军属和干部家属的子弟一千二百多人解决了入学或升学的问题。
    但通过此次普遍检查，发现全市优抚工作中还存在着下面几个问题：第一、由于过去优抚工作的宣传教育工作作得很不够，有些干部和群众对于优抚工作还有不正确的认识。最普遍的是民政部门的干部错误地认为优抚工作只是简单的事务工作；一般群众则认为这是政府民政部门的事，因而对烈军属不够尊重。如第一区什方院十九号房东故意半年不收房租，到法庭起诉，限期叫军属搬家。某市立医院的工作人员对看病的军属说：“你是军属，去找政府，和我们没有关系。”这些事情引起群众不满，有人说：“市民不尊敬军属，政府也不想法子。”第二、烈军属的生活问题尚未全部得到有效解决，优待粮有漏发和发放不及时的现象，因而有些烈军属经常到区公所要求救济。在这些生活困难的烈军属中，许多是有劳动力的，他们一般不愿享受优待，希望找到职业，以免增加人民负担。此次检查中即有三千四百多人提出这种要求。他们多数缺乏生产技术，文化程度低，或是年老的知识分子，找职业比较困难。但过去某些具备就业条件的人，政府也未替他们找到职业。如最近三个月来请保姆的很多，有些区干部总说没有人，此次检查中却发现第二区就有二十一个军属要求作这种工作。第三、贫苦烈军属的住房是一个严重问题。全市无房可住的烈军属有二百二十一户，其中以被房东撵搬家的占多数。无力修缮房屋的有三百四十一户。第四、贫苦烈军属得了急症或较严重的疾病需要住院时，则因优抚费有限和市立医院的病床不敷分配，至今尚未获适当解决。第五、全市无力入学和升学的烈军属子弟尚有一千五百多人。
    北京市通过这次检查，比较全面地了解了优抚工作的情况。这次检查是有成绩的；但是有些区的民政干部从本身工作和思想上所作的检查不够深刻，这样就不能有效地改正过去工作中的缺点和错误。其次，这次检查工作也作得比较粗糙。这主要是因为有些区公所未向参加检查工作的人员交待清楚。检查工作人员热情很高，但大多数缺乏经验，因而在检查时有人忘记写明烈军属的家庭情况，或没有写明要求职业和入学的是几个人，要求什么样的职业和入什么学校等。因为检查材料不具体，就难以有效地帮助烈军属解决困难。
    市民政局为了进一步作好优抚工作，除已和市文教局商讨解决了烈军属子弟入学和升学问题外，现已决定动员社会力量，组织市、区和派出所的三级优抚工作委员会，逐步解决贫苦烈军属的生活、住房、疾病治疗和就业等问题。
