　　Personnel of the Junliangcheng State-Owned Tianjin Equipment Company
    Casually Allowed Workers to Handle Toxic Materials
    Causing Injury to Seven Workers
    The personnel of the Junliangcheng State-Owned Tianjin Equipment Company in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, do not care about the health of the workers and casually allowed them to handle toxic materials, causing injury to seven workers. The incident occurred as follows: On the night of May 3rd, three train cars of acetic acid arrived, marked with danger signs. Worker Liu Peiqing asked Wang Guoxi, section chief of the Tianjin Equipment Company, whether moving this stuff would be harmful to the workers' health. Wang Guoxi said, "There's no danger." The storekeeper said, "It's okay, you can pick it up with your hands. If your hands feel pain, just wipe them with soil." The workers believed them and began to move the materials. While moving them, the workers felt a stinging sensation on their hands, and wiping them with soil was effective at the time. But after finishing the move, the workers' hands were swollen, and one worker suffered systemic poisoning, two workers had their backs burned, and four workers suffered minor injuries, all unable to work. The trade union then negotiated with Wang Guoxi. Wang Guoxi said, "If I had said it was dangerous at the time, how could we have completed the task?" The trade union cadres disagreed with this statement. He then shirked responsibility, saying that the workers were injured because they didn't know how to handle the materials.
    After the Tianjin Food Industry Trade Union and the Tianjin Equipment Company sent cadres to investigate and handle the matter, the solution was: the company would pay for the injured workers' medical expenses during their medical treatment, and their wages would be paid as usual; and the administrative department would purchase safety goggles, gloves, masks and other anti-poison equipment for use when handling toxic materials. In addition to agreeing with the above measures, I believe that responsibility should also be investigated. Wang's approach of simply focusing on completing the task without regard for the workers' health should be strictly criticized and educated to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.

　　军粮城国营天津市器材公司人员
    随便让工人搬运毒性物品
    使七名工人身体受到伤害
    河北省宁河县军粮城国营天津市器材公司人员不关心工人身体健康，随便让工人搬运毒性物品，使工人七名受伤。事情经过是这样的：五月三日夜间来了三火车醋酸，上面标着危险字样，工人刘佩清问天津市器材公司王国锡科长搬运这东西是否对工人身体健康有害？王国锡说“没危险”；保管员说：“不要紧，可以用手捧，若手感觉痛了用土一擦就好了。”工人们信以为真，便开始搬运。工人在搬运时手上感到刺痒，当时用土在手上擦擦也还有效。但等搬完以后，工人的手都肿了，并有一名工友全身中毒，两名工友背部被烧烂，四个工友受轻伤，亦均不能工作。工会便找王国锡交涉。王国锡说：“当时若说有危险，怎能完成任务？”工会干部不同意他这种说法。他又推卸责任，说工人受伤是由于自己不会搬。
    事后经天津市食品业工会和天津市器材公司派干部调查处理，解决办法是：受伤工人在医疗期间的医疗费由公司付给，工资照发；并由行政方面买风镜、手套、口罩等防毒工具，在搬运有毒物品时使用。对此事件的解决，我除同意以上办法外，认为还应追究责任，对王科长那种单纯为完成任务而不顾工人身体健康的作法，给以严格的批评和教育，以免今后再次发生类似事件。
