    The Tunliu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province Discovered Deviations in the Donation Movement During Inspection and Corrected Them Promptly Editor:
    After the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued a call to launch a donation campaign for airplanes and cannons, the people of our county responded enthusiastically, and the patriotic production increase and donation campaign has been widely launched. In order to ensure the correct development of the movement, the Tunliu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province recently sent inspection teams to key villages for inspection and found serious deviations in the movement in individual villages. The County Committee has paid attention to strengthening leadership, correcting deviations, and promoting better development of the movement.
    Now, we are telling you about the situation in Xilian Village, which has a large deviation, please publish it to attract attention from all over.
    Xilian Village has a total of ninety-five households and three hundred and twenty-seven people. The total amount of rice donated by the village has reached sixty-one shi and three dou. The deviations in the movement are:
    1. The donation movement was not launched on a certain political basis, and the movement was not used to educate the masses and improve their political awareness. The inspection team visited twenty-one farmers, and only five people, including Liu Youlin, had a slight understanding of the significance of the donation; six women could not say why they should donate at all; other people said, "Donations are for fighting Japan." Some said, "Donations are for catching spies."
    2. The donation movement is not combined with increasing production, improving management, improving work, and increasing income. Of the three hundred and twenty-seven people in the village, no more than twenty have made concrete plans to increase production and increase income. The village has revised the patriotic pact, but many cadres and people have forgotten the details of the patriotic pact. The work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has only been discussed simply, and no specific arrangements have been made.
    3. Violation of the principle of voluntary participation. When district cadres convened mass meetings to deploy donation work, they consciously set a range of about 30,000 yuan per person for the masses. Another village cadre once said: "We must not let the masses donate casually, otherwise the amount of donations will definitely be too small." Therefore, except for a few activists who donated more and three very poor households who did not donate, almost everyone donated between two and three dou of rice. For example, farmer Shen Wenxian said: "Anyway, two dou per person, less than that won't work." Another example is Wang Suo, a farmer from a difficult household, with two adults and one child in the family. He volunteered to donate two dou of rice, but at the meeting he saw that everyone else donated at least two dou, so he gritted his teeth and donated three dou. But the bookkeeper felt that it was "not up to standard", put the pen on the table, and asked: "Who will protect the fruits of your liberation?" It was not until he was forced to add to four dou that the bookkeeper wrote down his name and the amount of rice donated.
    The reasons for these deviations are mainly that district and village cadres lack understanding of the significance of carrying out the movement to increase production and donations, ignore the principles that should be grasped in the movement, and commit the mistake of commandism. In addition to planning to send inspection teams again for key inspections to correct deviations, create experience, and promote the movement, the Tunliu County Committee of the Communist Party of China also issued instructions to all subordinate party organizations, calling for a general inspection of the county's production increase and donation movement, to improve the understanding of district and village cadres on the donation movement, to fully mobilize the masses ideologically, and to lead the masses to find ways to increase production and increase income, to carry out patriotic production competitions, and to carry out the production increase and donation movement in a planned and leadership manner based on the voluntary participation of the masses.

  Northeast Railway Department and Harbin Clothing Factory
  Massive Purchases of Leather in Zhangjiakou Have Caused Confusion in Local Leather Prices Editor:
    According to the staff of Zhangjiakou City Trust Company, the Northeast Railway Department and Harbin Clothing Factory and other units are currently directly ordering large quantities of leather from private merchants in Zhangjiakou City, or entrusting Zhangjiakou City Trust Company to purchase leather at high prices on their behalf. The purchase price of sheepskin by the Animal Husbandry Company is 50,000 yuan per sheet, but the purchase price by Zhangjiakou City Trust Company is as high as 62,000 yuan. Because of such high-priced purchases, the price of leather in the Zhangjiakou market has become chaotic, and it will affect the supply of military leather. We raise this issue in the hope that relevant departments will pay attention to it.
        Reader Li Yingqi Zhang Jingru
    Editor's Note: In order to ensure the supply of military needs, the People's Government uniformly carries out the acquisition of some important military materials, such as various leather hides, through the Animal Husbandry Company. It is also determined that military procurement units shall not purchase across regions. This measure is completely correct and meets the current needs, which can avoid price fluctuations and ensure the supply of military leather. This is what public and private enterprises should unanimously support and earnestly implement. It is obviously wrong for the Northeast Railway Department and Harbin Clothing Factory to purchase leather across regions without authorization, and we hope that relevant departments will investigate and deal with it.

    中共山西省屯留县委员会检查捐献运动情况发现偏向及时纠正编辑同志：
    中国人民抗美援朝总会发出关于展开捐献飞机大炮运动的号召后，我县人民纷纷热烈响应，爱国增产捐献运动已经普遍展开。中共山西省屯留县委员会为了使运动正确开展，在最近派检查组下乡作重点检查，发现个别村在运动中有着严重的偏向。县委会已注意加强领导，纠正偏向，使运动更好地开展。
    现在，我们把偏向较大的西莲村的情况告诉你们，请发表，以引起各地注意。
    西莲村共九十五户，三百二十七口人。全村捐献米额已达六十一石三斗。运动中的偏向是：
    一、没有在一定的政治基础上展开捐献运动，并通过这个运动来教育群众，提高群众的政治认识。检查组访问了二十一个农民，只有刘有林等五人对捐献意义稍有了解；有六个妇女根本说不上为啥要捐献；其他群众有的说：“捐献是为了打日本。”有的说：“捐献是为了捉特务。”
    二、捐献运动没有和增加生产、改善经营、提高工作、增加收入相结合。全村三百二十七口人，订出增加生产、增加收入具体计划的还不过二十人。该村已修订了爱国公约，但很多干部、群众都忘了爱国公约的详细内容。优待烈属军属工作只是简单地谈过一下，也没有作具体的布置。
    三、违反自觉自愿原则。区干部在召开群众大会布置捐献工作的时候，就有意识地给群众摆了个每人三万元左右的圈子。又如一个村干部曾这样说：“不能让群众随便捐，这样捐献数目一定会小得不像话。”因此除了几个积极分子捐得较多和三户很贫户没捐外，其余每人差不多都捐米二斗以上三斗以下。如农民申文先说：“反正一人二斗，少了不行。”又如困难户农民王琐，全家两个大人、一个小孩。他自愿捐献二斗米，但在大会上看见旁人每人都至少捐二斗，就咬了咬牙，捐三斗。但记账人觉得“不合标准”，把笔向桌子上一放，问道：“你的翻身果实叫谁给你保卫啊？”直到他被迫加到四斗时，记账人才算把他的名字和捐献米额写上。
    发生这些偏向的原因，主要是区村干部对开展增产捐献运动的意义缺乏认识，忽视了运动中应掌握的原则，犯了命令主义的错误。中共屯留县委员会除计划再派遣检查组作重点检查，以纠正偏向、创造经验、推进运动外，并向所属各级党组织发出指示，号召对全县增产捐献运动普遍进行检查，提高区村干部对捐献运动的认识，充分在思想上发动群众，并领导群众找出增加生产、增加收入的门路，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，有计划有领导地开展增产捐献运动。

  东北铁路部门及哈尔滨被服厂
  在张家口大量收购皮革  引起了当地皮价的混乱编辑同志：
    据张家口市信托公司的职员谈，现有东北铁路部门及哈尔滨被服厂等单位，在张家口市直接向私商大量订购皮革，或委托张家口市信托公司高价代买皮革。畜产公司购价每张五万元的羊皮，张家口市信托公司代购价格竟达六万二千元。因为这样高价收购，致使张家口市场皮价陷于混乱，并会影响到军用皮革的供应。我们把这个问题提出来，希望有关部门注意。
        读者  李颖奇  张静如
    编者按：人民政府为保证军需供应，对一些重要军需物资，如各种皮张的收购，均归畜产公司统一进行。即军需采购单位，也确定不得越区采购。这一措施是完全正确和切合当前需要的，这样既可避免物价波动，也可保证军需皮革的供应。这是公私企业应该一致拥护和认真执行的。东北铁路部门及哈尔滨被服厂私自越区收购皮张，显然是错误的，希望有关部门调查处理。
