　　The Propaganda Work of the Xiyang County People's Cultural Center
　　Chai Zhongren
　　The Xiyang County People's Cultural Center in Shanxi Province has carried out propaganda on production, current affairs, and hygiene through cultural and recreational activities, playing a significant role in implementing the government's policies and promoting the work of the entire county. Over the past two years, through their unremitting efforts, the cultural center's propaganda activities have become a central force on the county's propaganda front.

　　Creating Lantern Slide Propaganda, Opening Up Activity Positions
　　The Xiyang County People's Cultural Center was founded in April 1949 by comrades Wang Xisheng and Yin Xingjin. At that time, they received more than 600 old books from the Xiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government and opened a library in a very simple place. At that time, in addition to cadres from various organs who came to browse the old books, few people came here for activities. In these difficult circumstances, the comrades of the Cultural Center, with a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, transformed the extremely simple lantern slides. After the lantern slides were shown, the masses said, "This is very interesting." This further encouraged their work enthusiasm. Under the guidance of comrades from the Fine Arts Department of the Taihang Literary and Art Federation, they first changed the glass strips of the lantern slides to cellophane, and the projection effect was better than before. However, the lamp box weighed seven pounds, which was inconvenient to carry when going to the countryside. They also worked with a comrade to study and replace most of the wooden parts with tinplate, so that the weight of the lamp box was reduced from seven pounds to four pounds, and they were not afraid of the gas lamp burning out, and the light could be more accurately aligned. The drawing of the lantern slides was also improved from simple cartoons to five-color art serials, from indistinct to clear yin and yang. This made the lantern slide propaganda warmly welcomed by the masses. In the past two years, in conjunction with current affairs, policies, production, hygiene, etc., 33 kinds of lantern slides have been drawn, totaling 1,274 pictures. They have been shown 143 times in urban and rural areas, with an audience of more than 85,800 people.

　　Since lantern slide propaganda was welcomed by the masses in various places, many villages bought gas lamps and asked the Cultural Center to help them make lantern slide boxes. The masses in villages such as Hanjiagou and Pangjiayu sent people to the Cultural Center to learn how to make lantern slides and draw lantern slides. In order to meet the needs of the masses, the Cultural Center focused on establishing seven rural lantern slide stations in Zhao Bi, Che Si, Jingyang, Xizhai and other villages, and developed 19 lantern slides, so that lantern slide propaganda began to develop in rural areas. The Cultural Center thus became the leading organ of the rural lantern slide stations, regularly supplying them with lantern slides, helping to repair lamp boxes, and introducing projection technology. At the same time, the lantern slide stations also became suppliers of materials to the Cultural Center, enriching the content of the lantern slides. Last winter, the Cultural Center supplied a total of 125 lantern slides to various lantern slide stations, and timely guided the central work of each period. After the establishment of rural lantern slide stations, with lantern slides as the center, the masses in nearby villages were united, and a organized, systematic and institutionalized lantern slide propaganda network was formed. In addition to the continuous supply of new lantern slides from the Cultural Center, the rural lantern slide stations also organized old painters to draw them, solving the difficulties in the production of lantern slides. For example, the Pangjiayu station drew 23 pictures of "The Crimes of Yiguandao", and the Jingyang station drew 58 pictures. According to the statistics of two months last winter, the rural lantern slide stations showed a total of 29 times, with an audience of more than 8,700 people. At present, lantern slide propaganda in Xiyang County has a relatively stable activity position, and it is still developing.

　　Educating the Masses with Models, Cartoons, and Real Object Exhibitions
　　After the comrades of the Cultural Center achieved good results in lantern slide propaganda, they also carried out propaganda through model, cartoon, and real object exhibitions. The Cultural Center once organized six or seven folk artists in the urban area to make a model of the "Map of New China", so that the masses knew that China is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and rich products. Later, three-dimensional models of common sense about maternal and infant hygiene were made. After seeing these models, an old woman in Hexi Village said: "I raised five children, and they all died on the sixth day. Now I know what's going on. I will definitely do what you say in the future." Later, models such as "Warm Water Seed Soaking," "Organizing Together is Better than Working Alone," "Raising Livestock Well," "Urban-Rural Mutual Assistance," and "Material Exchange" were successively made, and production guidance was effectively carried out in conjunction with the exhibition of new agricultural implements and fungicides. After watching the new agricultural implements, the militiamen of Huang'an Village in the seventh district said happily: "We will go back and organize ourselves to work hard for a year, and we must buy a straw cutter." After the Resist America and Aid Korea movement was launched, the Cultural Center specially created a current affairs exhibition room, drew 31 color cartoons, and made three-dimensional models such as "People All Over the World Who Love Peace Unite to Oppose Aggressive War," "Defend National Defense," and "The Crimes of Yiguandao." During the two-month exhibition period, the audience reached more than 12,000 people. This year, the Cultural Center transported the models to remote mountain villages for exhibitions, so that every place and everyone in the county could receive patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea. This propaganda method of educating the masses in the form of exhibitions is also developing in the rural areas of Xiyang.

　　Organizing Propaganda Teams to Go Deep into the Countryside
　　In August last year, the Cultural Center absorbed some primary school teachers to participate in the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea. The Cultural Center regularly supplied them with propaganda materials and helped answer questions. They used individual talks and small chats in the countryside to discover the masses' ideological situation, and then organized discussions to specifically solve their ideological problems. After the masses in Zhongsi Village recognized the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade Korea and further attack China, 12 young people automatically signed up to join the Volunteer Army.

　　In order to timely disseminate domestic and foreign current affairs news to the countryside, the Cultural Center copied the news broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station every night and printed it in time to provide blackboard newspaper materials for nearby villages. In addition, last winter, the Cultural Center compiled four kinds of scripts and 18 kinds of ditties and clapper talks related to current affairs to supply to 105 rural theater troupes in the county.

　　昔阳县人民文化馆的宣传工作
    柴钟仁
    山西省昔阳县人民文化馆通过文化娱乐活动，开展了生产、时事、卫生等宣传，在贯彻政府各项政策和推进全县工作上，起了重大的作用。二年来，经过他们不懈的努力，文化馆的宣传活动，已成为全县宣传战线上的一支中心力量。
    创造幻灯宣传，开辟活动阵地
    昔阳县人民文化馆是在一九四九年四月份由王希胜和尹兴晋两位同志负责创办的。当时他俩接收了中共昔阳县委和县人民政府六百多本旧书，在一个很简陋的地方开了馆。当时除各机关干部来翻看那几本旧书外，群众很少来这里活动。就在这种困难条件下，文化馆的同志们以高度的积极性和创造性，改造极其简陋的幻灯。放映幻灯后，群众说：“这很有看头。”这更鼓舞了他们的工作热情。在太行文联美术部同志指导下，他们首先把幻灯片的玻璃条改为玻璃纸，放映效果较前好些。但灯箱体重七斤，下乡时携带不便，又和一位同志共同研究，把许多木制零件大部改用洋铁片，使灯箱体重由七斤减到四斤，且不怕汽灯烧坏，光线也能对得更为准确。幻灯片的绘制也由简单的漫画改进到五彩美术的连环片，由明暗不分改进到阴阳分清。这就使幻灯宣传受到群众热烈的欢迎。两年来结合时事、政策、生产、卫生等，绘制出三十三种幻灯片，共一千二百七十四幅。在城关和农村放映了一百四十三次，观众达八万五千八百多人。
    幻灯宣传既为各地群众所欢迎，许多村子的群众就买了汽灯，要求文化馆帮他们制造幻灯箱。韩家沟和庞家峪等村群众，专门派人来文化馆学习制幻灯和绘幻灯片。文化馆为了满足群众的要求，有重点地在赵壁、车寺、静阳、西寨等村，建立了七个农村幻灯站，发展了十九个幻灯，使幻灯宣传在农村中开始发展起来。文化馆因此就形成了农村幻灯站的领导机关，经常供给他们幻灯片，帮助修理灯箱，介绍放映技术。同时，各幻灯站也成为文化馆的材料供给者，使幻灯片的内容充实起来。去年冬季，文化馆共供给各幻灯站幻灯片一百二十五付，及时地指导了各个时期的中心工作。农村幻灯站建立以后，以幻灯为中心，团结了附近各村的群众，并形成一个有组织、有系统、有制度的幻灯宣传网。农村幻灯站除由文化馆不断供给新的幻灯片外，又去组织旧画匠绘制，解决了幻灯片制作上的困难。如庞家峪站自己绘制了“一贯道罪行”等片二十三幅，静阳站绘制五十八幅。据去年冬季两个月的统计，农村幻灯站共放映了二十九次，观众达八千七百多人。目前昔阳县幻灯宣传，已经有了比较稳固的活动阵地，而且还正在继续发展着。
  用模型、漫画、实物展览教育群众
    文化馆的同志们，在幻灯宣传收到良好效果之后，又进行了模型、漫画、实物展览的宣传。文化馆曾组织城关六、七个民间艺人，制作了“新中国地图”的模型，使群众知道中国是一个地大物博、出产丰富的国家。以后又制作了有关妇婴卫生常识的立体模型。河西村一个老太太在看过这些模型之后说：“我养了五个小孩，都是六天头上就死了。这回可知道是怎回事了，以后我定要照你们说的办法去做。”以后又陆续制出“温汤浸种”、“组织起来要比单干好”、“养好牲畜”、“城乡互助”、“物资交流”等模型，配合新式农具和杀菌剂等实物展览，有效地进行了生产指导。七区黄安村民兵看了新式农具后高兴地说：“咱回去组织起来好好干上一年，一定要买个铡草机。”抗美援朝运动展开以后，文化馆专门创设了时事展览室，绘制了三十一幅彩色漫画，并制作了“全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来反对侵略战争”、“保卫国防”、“一贯道罪行”等立体模型。在两个多月的展览期中，观众达一万二千多人。今年文化馆把模型运到偏僻的山村展览，使全县每一处每一个人都能受到抗美援朝的爱国主义教育。这种以展览会形式教育群众的宣传方法，在昔阳农村中也正在发展着。
  组织宣传队伍深入农村
    去年八月，文化馆吸收一部分小学教员参加抗美援朝的宣传工作。文化馆经常供给他们宣传材料，并帮助解答问题。他们在农村用个别谈话和小型漫谈等方式，发现了群众的思想情况，然后组织讨论，具体解决他们的思想问题。中思乐村群众在认清了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和进一步进攻中国的阴谋后，有十二个青年自动报名参加志愿军。
    为了及时地向农村传播国内外时事消息，文化馆每晚把中央人民广播电台播送的新闻抄收下来，及时地印发给附近村庄做黑板报材料。此外，文化馆在去冬曾编写了四种剧本、十八种有关时事的小调、快板，供给全县一百零五个农村剧团。
