　　Intellectuals' Reflections
　　Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Peking University

　　For thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, have led the Chinese people in arduous and correct revolutions, a truly earth-shaking great undertaking. Today, the people have stood up, national prosperity can be expected, and the People's Republic of China is already a top-tier power internationally. The entire world situation has been changed by the success of our revolution. The merits of the Communist Party are endless, visible to all, and need not be stated. But on its thirtieth birthday, let the intellectuals in the process of transformation (the people in the schools) think about this: How did our leading Party achieve such great accomplishments? What lessons have we intellectuals learned? What have we realized?

　　Such questions cannot be answered clearly in a short time with a few words, and I myself only have some vague impressions, without a thorough understanding, and cannot explain them clearly. But I think the reason for the Communist Party's success is not a secret; it is actually simple: the sincerity in serving the people and the solidness of learning.

　　Which of the people in the past did not sing the praises of saving the country and the people? Which of them was not familiar with the maxims "the people are the foundation of the state" and "the people are precious"? Were there not some intellectuals in the past who made the grand vow of "entering hell" and "saving all living beings"? But in fact, did they solve the problem of "the people's suffering"? No! Absolutely not! Their words stopped at words, their grand vows stopped at grand vows, but in fact, they only had superficial enthusiasm for the people's suffering, and deep concern for personal interests. Therefore, when they encountered tests, they were captured by fame and fortune and became slaves of the rulers. As for the cruel abuse suffered by the peasants of Jiangsu at the hands of "Peeling Skin Xiao" and "Muscle-Extracting Dong," and the inhuman oppression imposed on the working masses of Tianqiao by the Four Tyrants and Five Tigers, our self-proclaimed gentlemen who "save the people from fire and water," either ignored them and did not hear their tragic voices, or heard them but could do nothing. Until now, the common people all say, "The Communist Party has come, we have turned ourselves over, we have people to make decisions for us!" And we intellectuals, upon hearing the people's cries of accusation, cannot help but be shocked and "lose ourselves," suddenly realizing that even if we had good intentions in the past, at least it was of no avail. In the past, our methods did not truly serve the people at all.

　　Some gentlemen also ask: In the past, were there not people who risked their lives for the people, endured hardship and worked hard, day after day for decades? Yes, there certainly were. But they did not do in-depth research, did not have real learning, were ignorant of the source of "the people's suffering," and therefore had no way to "save the people from fire and water." Only Marxists have deeply studied human history, thoroughly analyzed the nature of society, and understood that the socio-economic structure of the past inevitably produced such results. They also deeply experienced this in the process of practice, knowing the why and wherefore of life and society. Therefore, they can discover the crux of the problem and solve it. The research that we intellectuals were familiar with in the past was not profound for society and history, and was divorced from reality and did not conform to the actual situation. Therefore, we often had the intention to save the country, but lacked the ability to turn the tide. In the past, we intellectuals often admired the Communist Party's achievements in handling affairs, but belittled their theoretical attainments. Looking at it today, they have led the people to solve problems that have not been solved for two thousand years, which cannot be without a solid foundation of real learning. Looking at it today, we only had superficial knowledge of society and history in the past, and Marxism is the real science.

　　Furthermore, the Communist Party's spirit of service is closely related to its scientific achievements. On the one hand, the success of service depends on the correctness of its theory. Revolutionary actions that "accord with the laws of nature and respond to human feelings" must be due to their mastery of the laws of nature and deep understanding of human feelings. On the other hand, the correctness of science depends on its people's position. Labor creates the world, and the people are the foundation of society. If a theory obliterates the position of the working masses, it will inevitably distort history, and thus either believe that a minority of people should originally enjoy privileges, or believe that heroes can create circumstances. As a result, the theory instead supports the privileges of a minority of people and upholds the tyranny of dictatorship, instead of serving the masses of the people. The historical objective attitude that intellectuals admired in the past, from the current point of view, is both distorting facts and reactionary. The philosophy of Marxism-Leninism and all social sciences have fundamental differences from past philosophy and social sciences. The new philosophy and science are not only tools for the struggle to serve the people, but the people's position permeates their content. It proves that any theory that transcends class and transcends the people is actually serving a minority of rulers. In the past, we intellectuals took such anti-people theories and wanted them to achieve the purpose of saving the people, which was truly like "climbing a tree to catch fish," a contradiction in itself.

　　Furthermore, Marxists-Leninists not only believe that the world must be transformed, but also attach importance to the consistency between transforming the world and personal transformation. True learning not only aims to serve the people, but must also firmly establish the people's position as its basic starting point. If intellectuals themselves do not have the people's position, and seek to achieve the purpose of serving the people in what they research and disseminate, it is completely impossible. Moreover, science is based on facts, and all theories must come from facts, and those who study theory must also be able to complete something from practice. The world is constantly changing, constantly innovating, and constantly developing. And the theories we obtain in practice must also constantly change, constantly innovate, and constantly develop. That is to say, our own minds must also be constantly innovated and constantly transformed. Scientific theory must conform to objective facts in order to maintain its scientific nature. Scientists must transform themselves in order to transform the world; and transform themselves in the transformation of the world. In the past, intellectuals either denied the change of the world, or did not seek their own innovation; or on the one hand, refused to transform themselves, and on the other hand, demanded the transformation of the world. Isn't that a very unreasonable idea?

　　In summary, on the thirtieth birthday of the Communist Party, when everyone is celebrating the success of the people's democratic revolution it led, intellectuals should have already awakened. Not only have the peasants turned themselves over and gotten rid of the shackles of the landlords for two thousand years, but intellectuals should also turn themselves over and smash the shackles of thought for two thousand years. However, in reality, after the rise of proletarian theory, the shackles of thought in the past have been shattered. The enthusiasm of "treating the people as if they were wounded" that intellectuals were proud of in the past has now proven to be a fantasy. The precise theories they considered in the past have now proven to be obliterating facts. The objective and fair viewpoints they boasted about in the past have now proven that they can only be used by the rulers, and their effects are not fair. Intellectuals often thought that what they were standing on was rock, but today they found that it was quicksand. Intellectuals should turn over and change! We should learn from the Communist Party, learn their sincerity in serving the people, learn the solidness of their learning, and learn their spirit of seeking truth from facts! We want to transform the world and transform ourselves.

### 知识分子的体会

　　知识分子的体会
    北京大学副校长  汤用彤
    三十年来，中国共产党和其伟大的领袖毛泽东主席坚苦地正确地领导了中国人民的革命，一个真正天翻地覆的伟大事业。到今日人民是站起来了，国家富强可以预期，在国际上中华人民共和国已经是头等强国，世界整个形势已因我们革命的成功为之改观。共产党的功绩是说不完的，有目共睹，也不必说。但是在它三十周年的生日，让在改造过程中的知识分子（学校里的人们）想一下罢：我们领导的党何以有这样伟大的成就呢？我们知识分子所得到的教训是些什么？体会到些什么呢？
    这样的问题不是短时间三言两语可以说得清楚的，并且我自己只有一些模糊的印象，并无彻底的认识，也不能说清楚。但是我想共产党成功的道理并非秘诀，实在简单，就是为人民服务的真挚和学问的踏实。
    过去的人士那一个不高唱救国救民呢？那一个不熟习“民为邦本”、“民为贵”的格言呢？过去的知识分子中也不是有些发过“入地狱”“救众生”的弘愿吗？但是事实上他们解决了“民生疾苦”的问题吗？没有的！事实上没有的！他们口说止于口说，弘愿止于弘愿，但事实上对于人民痛苦，只有浅薄之热情，对于个人利害却具深切之顾虑，所以一遇考验，即为名利所俘虏，为统治者作奴才。至于江苏的农民为“萧剥皮”“董抽筋”所加惨酷的虐待，天桥的劳苦大众为四霸五虎所施的非人的压迫，其悲惨的声音，我们自命“救民于水火之中”的先生们，或者漠然并未听见，或者听见也没有办法。直到现在，老百姓大家都说“共产党来了，我们翻身了，我们有人作主了！”而我们知识分子听了人民控诉的呼声，方才不禁心惊魄动，“瞿然自失”，恍然过去即有好心肠，至少也是无济于事，过去我们的办法并未丝毫真正为人民服务。
    有的先生还问：过去的人士为着人民不惜身命，坚苦卓绝，数十年如一日者，不也是有的吗？是的，确是有的。但是他们未作深刻的研究，没有真实的学问，茫然于“民生疾苦”之来源，也就对于“救民于水火”没有办法。直至马克思主义者才精深的研究了人类的历史，彻底的分析了社会的性质，了然于过去那样的社会经济的结构必然产生那样的结果。他们又在实践的过程中，深心体会，于人生社会知其然又知其所以然，因此能发现症结，能解决问题。过去我们知识分子所熟悉的研究，对于社会、历史原不深刻，而又脱离实际，不合实情；因此常救国有心，而回天乏术。过去我们知识分子常佩服共产党办事的成就，而轻视他们的理论的造诣；今日看起来，他们领导人民解决了两千年未解决的问题，这自不能没有真实学问的基础。今日看起来，我们过去对于社会历史仅有浮泛的知识，而马克思主义才是真正的科学。
    复次，共产党服务的精神与其科学的创获有密切之关系。一方面服务的成功有赖于其理论之正确，凡革命行动“顺乎天理、应乎人情”者，必定因其精通天理，深悉人情。另一方面科学之正确有赖于其人民的立场，劳动创造世界，人民本为社会之基础；若理论抹杀劳动大众之地位，则必至于歪曲历史；由此而或以为少数人本来应享特权，或以为英雄可造时势。其结果，理论反而支持少数人之特权，拥护独裁之横暴，而不为人民大众服务。过去知识分子所欣赏之历史客观态度，从现在看来，既歪曲事实，而且具有反动性。马克思列宁主义的哲学与一切社会科学都与过去的哲学和社会科学有基本区别，新的哲学与科学不但是为人民服务的斗争工具，而且人民立场渗透于其内容之中。证明一切超阶级、超人民立场的理论，实在是为少数统治者服务。过去我们知识分子拿这样的反人民的理论，而欲其达到救人民之目的，真如“缘木求鱼”，自相矛盾了。
    复次，马克思列宁主义者不但认为要改造世界，而且重视改造世界与个人改造的一致性。真实的学问不但以服务人民为目的，而且须确定以人民的立场为其基本的出发点。知识分子个人本身若无人民的立场，而求其所研究者，所传布者达到为人民服务之目的，是完全不可能的事。而且科学根据事实，一切理论必须从事实中来，而研究理论者亦必从实践中乃能有所完成。世界是永远不断变化，不断革新，不断发展。而我们在实践中所得到的理论亦须不断变化，不断革新，不断发展。也就是说我们自己的头脑亦须不断的革新，不断的改造。科学理论须符合客观事实，乃能保持其科学性。科学家须改造自己，乃能改造世界；而又于世界改造之中来改造自己。过去知识分子既否认世界的改变，也不求自己的革新；或者一面拒绝改造自己，而一面又要求世界之改造，岂不是大不合理的想法吗？
    总起来说，在共产党三十周年生日，大家庆祝其所领导的人民民主革命成功之际，知识分子应该已有觉悟。不但农民翻身，已摆脱二千年来地主的枷锁；而知识分子同样应该翻身，粉碎二千年来思想的桎梏。不过实在说来，过去思想的桎梏，自无产阶级理论兴起之后，已经被粉碎了；过去知识分子所引以自豪“视民如伤”的热情，今日证明其为空想；其所视为精密的理论，今日证明其为抹杀事实；其所夸耀的客观持平论点，今日证明其只能为统治者所利用，其效果并不公允；知识分子们往往以为脚下所站的是岩石，今日乃发现其为沙碛。知识分子们应该翻身改变了罢！我们应该向共产党学习，学习他们服务人民的真挚，学习他们学问的踏实，学习他们的实事求是的精神！我们要改造世界并且改造我们自己。
