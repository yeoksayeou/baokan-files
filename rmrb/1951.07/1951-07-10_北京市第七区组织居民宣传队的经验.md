The Seventh District of Beijing established resident propaganda teams in May to regularly conduct patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea among residents. This propaganda team was formed by activists from the popularization of the movement to resist America and aid Korea in April. It currently has 865 members, of whom 42% are women. They are divided into 15 teams according to police stations and further divided into 127 groups according to streets and alleys, with each group having 3 to 12 members.

Since the establishment of the propaganda team, the members have successively studied news about the Fifth Battle of Korea, Mayor Peng Zhen's report on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the three patriotic calls issued by the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea on June 1st, and how to establish patriotic covenants. Each team has generally publicized these contents to the masses two or three times, which has generally been welcomed by the masses.

In the work of organizing the propaganda team, the main problems encountered in leadership and the experience in solving these problems are as follows:

I. The Leadership of the Propaganda Team. The propaganda team of the Seventh District is led by the District Association to Resist America and Aid Korea. Because the various propaganda teams were newly established and had many problems, the district's leading departments assigned more cadres to lead the propaganda teams (eight cadres who regularly work at each police station, each leading one to three propaganda teams); at the same time, attention was paid to cultivating the leadership ability and prestige of the propaganda team leaders, and regular joint meetings of team leaders were held to prevent cadres from doing everything themselves (this phenomenon has already occurred), so that the propaganda team can truly become a mass propaganda organization. In the future, after the team leaders of each propaganda team have a certain degree of independent working ability, the cadres can be gradually withdrawn, leaving only two or three people to guide the work of each propaganda team in a flexible manner. At the same time, propaganda officers from the organs are assigned to serve as political instructors for the propaganda teams to help the members study. In addition, some propaganda team leaders and members currently have other jobs. In order to cherish their time and energy, the district's leading organs have decided not to hold too many meetings and to solve their part-time job issues in a planned manner.

II. Member Conditions and Review Issues. When the propaganda team was first established, the district's leading organs put forward the conditions for being a propaganda team member: politically clean, upright in style, voluntary and enthusiastic about propaganda work. The method of finding members is: first, the cadres and the Associations to Resist America and Aid Korea in each police station select candidates from among the active elements of the masses, submit a list, and the cadres and police station review it; after obtaining the consent of the individual, it is then approved by the leading organ. At the same time, we reported the significance of establishing a propaganda team and the conditions for members at the district's resident representatives conference to resist America and aid Korea. Later, the list of propaganda team members was announced to the masses. In this way, the propaganda team established prestige among the masses and also encouraged the working enthusiasm of the members. However, at the beginning, we had too high requirements for the conditions of the propaganda team members, which narrowed the propaganda team and affected the working enthusiasm of some active elements who were not recruited as propaganda team members. Therefore, we later appropriately recruited more propaganda team members. Currently, the number of propaganda team members in each police station accounts for about one-third of the representatives of the Association to Resist America and Aid Korea. We believe that the propaganda team is a mass propaganda organization, and the general conditions for members should not be too high, but attention must be paid to political conditions. This time, due to negligence in the review, even a Taoist altar master who had always followed the Yi Guan Dao religion was mixed into the propaganda team, which is a lesson.

III. The Education of Members. The working enthusiasm of the propaganda team members is generally very high, but they know very little about current affairs and policies, and their cultural level is also low (illiterates and semi-illiterates account for 28%; those who are barely literate and have a primary school education account for 63%; and those with higher education only account for 9%). Therefore, it is necessary to organize them to study. Now, each propaganda team has established a weekly study system. The content of the study is: learn what to publicize. The method of study is to have the cadres explain first, and then discuss. Only one or two issues are discussed each time, in a simple and concise manner, and the time should not be too long. In the future, we also plan to develop a study plan for the propaganda team members and add some political common sense learning content.

IV. Propaganda Methods. In the first half of May, the propaganda teams mainly used methods such as holding resident forums and conducting family visits to publicize; but if these methods are used frequently, not only will the members spend too much time, but the masses will also feel bored. In the second half of May, each team adopted and created some new propaganda methods, such as organizing residents to listen to the radio, holding small exhibitions, organizing study classes, literacy classes, reading groups, and running blackboard newspapers. These methods are practical and feasible and are very popular among the masses. In the future, it is necessary to continue to give play to the creativity of the masses, let them come up with better propaganda methods, and constantly summarize experience and promote good methods; and should not subjectively prescribe a set of unified propaganda methods in advance. However, attention should be paid to educating the propaganda team members: do not casually convene mass meetings. A propaganda team member from the Eighth Police Station once convened a mass meeting of more than one hundred people on his own, and talked nonsense at the meeting, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses.

### 北京市第七区组织居民宣传队的经验

　　北京市第七区组织居民宣传队的经验
    北京市第七区在五月份建立了居民宣传队，经常向居民进行抗美援朝的爱国主义教育。这支宣传队是由四月份普及抗美援朝运动中的积极分子组成的，现有队员八百六十五人，其中妇女占百分之四十二。他们按派出所分为十五个队，又按街巷分为一百二十七个小组，每组有队员三人至十二人。
    宣传队建立以后，队员们先后学习了关于朝鲜第五次战役的新闻、彭真市长关于镇压反革命问题的报告、和平解放西藏办法的协议的有关材料、抗美援朝总会六月一日发出的三项爱国号召和怎样订立爱国公约等。各队即根据这些内容，普遍向群众宣传过二、三次。一般都受到群众的欢迎。
    在组织宣传队工作中，在领导方面所遇到的问题和解决这些问题的经验，主要有下列几点：
    一、宣传队的领导问题。七区的宣传队，是由区抗美援朝会领导的，各宣传队因建立不久，问题很多，因此区的领导部门配备了较多的干部来领导宣传队（由八名常赴各派出所工作的干部，每人领导一个到三个宣传队）；同时又注意了培养宣传队队长的领导能力和威信，定期召开队长联席会议，防止干部包办代替（这个现象现在已经发生），以便使宣传队真正成为群众的宣传组织。将来各宣传队的队长有了一定的独立工作能力以后，即可将干部逐渐抽回，只留两三人机动地指导各宣传队的工作。同时，分配机关宣传员去作宣传队的政治教员，帮助队员学习。此外，目前有些宣传队长、队员兼有其他工作，为了珍惜他们的时间和精力，区的领导机关决定不要开会太多，而且要有计划地解决他们的兼职问题。
    二、队员条件和审查问题。最初建立宣传队时，区的领导机关提出了可作宣传队员的条件是：政治清白，作风正派，自愿并热心作宣传工作。物色队员的办法是：首先由干部和各派出所的抗美援朝会从群众积极分子中选择对象，提出名单，由干部和派出所审查；在征得本人同意后，再经领导机关批准。同时，我们又在全区居民抗美援朝代表会上报告了建立宣传队的意义和队员的条件。以后，又在群众中公布了宣传队员的名单。这样，使宣传队在群众中树立了威信，也鼓舞了队员的工作情绪。但在开始时，我们对宣传队员的条件要求太高，缩小了宣传队伍，并且影响了一些未被吸收作宣传队员的积极分子的工作情绪，因此，后来又适当地多吸收了一些宣传队员。现在各派出所宣传队员的人数，占抗美援朝代表会代表的三分之一左右。我们认为：宣传队是群众性的宣传组织，队员的一般条件不能要求过高，但必须注意政治条件。此次因为审查疏忽，竟让一个一贯道坛主也混进了宣传队，这是一个教训。
    三、队员的教育问题。宣传队员的工作情绪一般都很高，但对时事、政策所知很少，文化水平也较低（文盲半文盲占百分之二十八；粗通文字和小学程度的占百分之六十三；文化程度较高的只占百分之九），因此必须组织他们进行学习。现在，各宣传队都已订立了每周一次的学习制度。学习的内容是：宣传什么就学什么。学习的方法是先由干部讲解，然后讨论。每次只讲一个或两个问题，通俗简短，时间不要太长。今后还准备订出宣传队员的学习计划，增添一些政治常识的学习内容。
    四、宣传方法问题。五月上半月，各宣传队主要是采用召开居民座谈会和进行家庭访问的方式来宣传；但如果经常使用这些方法，不独队员费时太多，群众也会感觉厌烦。五月下半月，各队都采用和创造了一些新的宣传办法，如组织居民收听广播、举办小型的展览会、组织学习班、识字班、读报组和办黑板报等。这些方法，都是切实可行的，很受群众欢迎。今后必须继续发挥群众的创造性，由他们想出更好的宣传方法，并不断总结经验，推广好的方法；而不应该主观地先规定一套统一的宣传方法。但应注意教育宣传队员：不可随便召集群众开会。第八派出所某宣传队员曾自行召开了一个百余人的群众会，在会上乱讲一通，引起群众很大的不满。
