Promoting Good Experiences in Establishing Patriotic Covenants!

    Experiences in Implementing the Patriotic Covenant in West Lane Hutong, Second District, Beijing
    Chu Chuanheng
    West Lane Hutong is located on Erlong Road in the Eighth Police Station of the Second District of Beijing. On April 20th, the sixteen households in the hutong jointly established a patriotic covenant, and each household subsequently established its own family patriotic covenant. The establishment of the hutong patriotic covenant fully promoted democracy, and the content was specific. In the two months since the covenant was established, the hutong has changed significantly, and the people have changed from the bottom of their hearts because everyone has adhered to the patriotic covenant. The sixteen families, which had always lacked mutual contact and concern, have gradually become a united, mutually supportive, friendly, and cooperative big family.
    The establishment of the patriotic covenant in West Lane Hutong was led and underwent serious discussions by the masses. Before the covenant was established, the Beijing leadership sent cadres to assist, and the activists kept firmly in mind from the beginning: the patriotic covenant must not "fail in any point," so it is necessary to follow the mass line. At the first residents' meeting, activists proposed to everyone: "Resisting America and Aiding Korea is everyone's responsibility. While the volunteers are fighting, the workers are increasing production, and we should study what we should do ourselves." As a result, everyone started their brains and made speeches based on their own situations. They came up with various methods and put forward various guarantees. The activists then summarized and organized everyone's opinions, which produced the initial draft of the patriotic covenant. Afterwards, the activists went door-to-door to solicit opinions on this initial draft. Two households initially disagreed with "mandatory attendance at meetings"; one household proposed to add "unity and mutual assistance to strive to be a model group." After such careful consultation, revisions were made based on everyone's opinions. Finally, a second residents' meeting was convened, and after a solemn discussion by all residents, it officially became the patriotic covenant of all residents of the hutong. It was then written in large characters on paper and posted in the alley. Each household scrambled to copy it back so that they could follow it at any time. Everyone was very satisfied with this method of establishing the covenant.
    Now that the covenant has been established, what methods can be used to ensure its consistent implementation? They have a very good method, which is that everyone has stipulated an "Resist America and Aid Korea Day," that is, every Sunday evening, the households that established the patriotic covenant gather together to hold a meeting. The chairman and recorder are temporarily elected, so that everyone can take turns to serve as much as possible. The content of the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" includes: First, check the implementation of the covenant by each household item by item (checked every two weeks). The chairman reads one item, and each household reports on the implementation. If it is implemented very well, the chairman and everyone will immediately praise it; second, talk about the newspapers and discuss national affairs; third, discuss various issues raised by the masses that need to be resolved; fourth, the leader of the patriotic covenant group conveys the work arranged by the police station during the week, so that everyone knows what to do recently; fifth, if necessary, discuss and revise certain clauses of the patriotic covenant. For example, after the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued three major calls, they revised the hutong patriotic covenant and the family patriotic covenant.
    For more than two months, they have always adhered to this system, so that the work of resisting America and aiding Korea has been continuously improved. The "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" is held in each household in turn, which can strengthen mutual contact. On Sunday morning, the group leader hangs a blackboard with the time and content of the meeting written on it at the door of the household where the meeting is held. In this way, each household automatically and punctually attends the meeting. Everyone attaches great importance to this gathering. Sometimes, if someone comes home late from an outside trip, he would rather not bother to eat first, but go to the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day." They plan to hold each meeting for only one hour, but sometimes if there are major issues, everyone feels it is necessary to continue, as long as everyone passes it, the time can be extended. The meeting is full of democratic, united, and friendly atmosphere. For example, "July 1st" happened to be their "Resist America and Aid Korea Day," so everyone unanimously passed a motion to extend the meeting time. The newspaper speaker, Ma Guangyuan, gave everyone a lecture on the history of the Party according to the materials in the newspaper, and then everyone conducted a recollection and comparison of their lives. From eight o'clock to eleven o'clock, everyone not only did not feel tired, but also felt that they had received a great education.
    When holding the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day," everyone also jointly solves various practical problems. Once, a corner of Wang's wall collapsed, and it happened to smash Shen's spittoon. The two families quarreled, one insisting on compensation at the price, and the other thinking that it was the wall that smashed it and should not be liable. Later, they brought it up at the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" and asked everyone to judge. At that time, someone proposed a 50% compensation method, but someone said: "For the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea, we must unite, and there is this provision in the patriotic covenant." After everyone's discussion, they were all moved. Not only did they stop quarreling, but Wang Da Niang was willing to compensate, but Shen Da Ma firmly refused to accept it. Finally, both parties unanimously agreed to use the compensation fee to donate airplanes and cannons.
    Because they have adhered to the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day," they have urged that every clause of the patriotic covenant can be put into practice. For more than two months, every patriotic covenant has not failed, and great achievements have been achieved.
  Promoted Political and Cultural Learning
    Originally, none of the sixteen households subscribed to a newspaper. In order to implement the "reading newspapers" clause in the patriotic covenant, everyone pooled money and subscribed to a People's Daily, which was circulated in each household in turn every day. The next day, the group leader collected it and kept it uniformly. At the beginning, they felt that the newspaper was big and the content was large, and they didn't know which one to read. So, everyone came up with a method: those with higher cultural levels would mark out the important ones; sometimes when they saw very good materials, they would put them on the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" for explanation and discussion. However, some housewives who did not recognize words could not read the newspaper and could only wait to listen to others' explanations at the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day." They felt very dissatisfied and felt the need to learn culture. However, they had children at home and many things to do, so they could not find time to go to night school. They raised this difficult question at the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day." After everyone's discussion, it was decided on the spot that four housewives who recognized words would be assigned to teach six illiterate housewives to read.
  Unity and Mutual Assistance as Close as a Family
    In the past, although the sixteen households lived in the same hutong, they never liked to visit each other, and no one cared about anyone. When activists had something to discuss with everyone, some residents ignored them, and behind their backs they said, "So active, how much millet do you earn a month?" After the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the patriotic covenant stipulated that everyone should unite and help each other. In the past two months, the situation has changed greatly. Yang Guangyuan, a resident of the hutong, works at the post office, so he has taken on the task of sending letters, withdrawing remittances, and picking up parcels for all sixteen households. He said, "I can do it easily on my way to and from work." Everyone began to feel the benefits of unity and mutual assistance for everyone.
    The house rented by an old woman, Shen, was in danger of collapsing due to years of disrepair. In the past, who would care about such a thing? But since there was a patriotic covenant, it was different. Guo Junqing, the leader of the patriotic covenant group in the hutong, went to discuss with the Kan family at No. 4 immediately after learning about this situation. The Kan family automatically invited the old woman Shen to live in his home until she repaired the house and moved back.
    From these facts, it is not difficult to see that the relationship between households and between people in this hutong is undergoing a tremendous change.
  Increase Production and Donate Airplanes and Cannons
    Since the establishment of the patriotic covenant on April 20, they have been sending books and newspapers to the volunteers every month, writing letters of condolences, and reporting on their implementation of the patriotic covenant. After the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued three major calls on June 1, they not only changed "saving savings" to "donating airplanes and cannons," but also came up with various ways to increase production and donate. Now fourteen housewives have formed a "Resist America and Aid Korea Production Group," who go to Beixinqiao to receive a quota of more than two hundred pairs of cloth socks to be sewn by the cooperative, and all the wages they earn, except for the travel expenses, are donated. In addition, the women also pasted two pounds of paper bags to sell for money to donate. Yang Guangyuan's wife can sew. Her production increase plan is: to sew clothes for others for only half price (to show unity and mutual assistance), and all the wages except for the cost are used to donate airplanes and cannons. Although their income from increasing production is limited, their patriotic enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. They said: "In order to donate airplanes and cannons and defeat American imperialism as soon as possible, we will do whatever we can!"
  Develop a Habit of Loving Cleanliness and Loving Labor
    Every morning at five or six o'clock, the women who participated in the "Cleanliness Mutual Assistance Group" habitually got up. They swept their own yards and then swept West Lane Hutong. Then they ran out of the hutong to clean the streets of Erlong Road. When the residents were still sleeping, they had already swept the streets and happily went home. Today, this work is very pleasant for them, like doing their own thing. But some of them, before the covenant was established, were not even willing to clean their own houses. There is a girl named Zhang in the "Cleanliness Mutual Assistance Group" who used to get up at twelve o'clock every day. The first thing she did after getting up was to cook and eat. After eating, she closed the door. If you asked her to sweep the streets, it would be more difficult than ascending to heaven. Now she has become an active member of sweeping the streets. There is also an old woman Yuan who runs a construction factory, who only cares about her own cleanliness and never cares about others. Since the covenant was established, the "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" has educated her time after time. She saw that it was almost summer, but there were still four households whose toilets did not have wooden covers. She automatically made four wooden covers and sent a lot of white ash. Not only did she insist on not charging money, but she also said, "This is also resisting America and aiding Korea!"
    That's how it is, the people of West Lane Hutong like to talk to others about their patriotic covenant, and they like to spend their "Resist America and Aid Korea Day" even more.

    北京市二区西巷胡同执行爱国公约的经验
    储传亨
    北京市第二区第八派出所的二龙路有条西巷胡同，四月二十日，胡同里的十六户人家，合订了一个爱国公约，各户又陆续订了家庭爱国公约。订胡同爱国公约时，充分发扬了民主，内容又订得具体。订约以来二个多月，由于大家坚持执行了爱国公约，胡同就变了样，人们也从心眼里变了样，一向缺乏互相联系、互相关心的十六个家庭，逐步变成一个团结互助友爱合作的大家庭。
    西巷胡同爱国公约的订立，是有领导的，并且经过了群众的认真讨论。公约订立前，北京市领导机关曾派了干部下去协助，积极分子从一开始起就牢牢地记住：爱国公约要“一条也不许它落空”，因此就必须走群众路线。在第一次居民大会上，积极分子向大家提出：“抗美援朝，人人有份。志愿军打仗，工人们增产，我们要研究一下我们自己应该怎么办。”于是，大家便开动脑筋，结合自己的情况纷纷发了言。他们想出了各种办法，提出了各项保证，积极分子再把大家的意见加以综合整理，便产生了爱国公约的初稿。以后，积极分子又把这个初稿挨家逐户地去征求意见，有两户最初对“开会必到”表示了不同意；有一户提出要增加“团结互助争取当模范组”。经过这样仔细的商量后，又根据大家意见，重新做了修改。最后，召开了第二次居民大会，经过全体居民郑重讨论通过后，才正式成为全胡同居民的爱国公约。再用大字写在纸上，贴在巷内。各户又都争着抄了回去，以便自己随时依照执行。这种订法，大家都感到很满意。
    公约订好了，用什么办法保证公约的坚持执行呢？他们有个很好的办法，就是大家规定了个“抗美援朝日”，就是每到星期天的晚上，订立爱国公约的各户，集合在一起开会，主席和记录都是临时推选的，尽可能使大家轮流来担任。“抗美援朝日”的内容：一是逐条检查各户执行公约的情况（每两周检查一次），由主席读一条，各户汇报执行情况，有执行得很好，立刻就受到主席和大家的表扬；二是讲讲报纸，谈谈国家大事；三是讨论群众提出来要求解决的各种问题；四是由爱国公约小组长传达一下本周内派出所布置的工作，让大家知道最近要做什么事。五是，如有必要，就讨论修改爱国公约的某些条文。例如，抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，他们就修改了胡同爱国公约和家庭爱国公约。
    两个多月来，他们始终坚持着这一制度，使抗美援朝工作不断得到改进。“抗美援朝日”是在各家轮流举行的，这样可以加强彼此的联系。在星期天的早上，小组长便把一块写上了开会的时间和内容的黑板，挂在开会那家门口，如此，各户便自动而准时地到会了。大家都很重视这个集会，有时，有的人出外回家晚了些，他宁可不忙吃饭，先去过“抗美援朝日”。他们预定每次会议只开一小时，但有时有了重大问题，大家觉得必要开下去，只要全体通过，也可延长时间。会上充满民主、团结、友爱的气氛。例如“七一”那天，恰巧也是他们的“抗美援朝日”，于是，大家一致通过延长开会时间，由讲报员马广元按照报纸的材料，给大家讲了党史，然后大家又进行了生活的回忆对比。从八点开到十一点，大家不但不觉累，而且都认为受到了很大的教育。
    在举行“抗美援朝日”的时候，大家还共同解决各种实际问题。有一次王家的墙塌了一角，正巧把沈家的痰桶砸破了，两家就吵吵嚷嚷，一个非要照价赔偿不可，一个认为那是墙砸的不能认账。后来，他们便提到“抗美援朝日”上，请大家评理。当时有人提出了赔一半的办法，可是有人说：“为了抗美援朝，就要团结，爱国公约上有着这条规定”，经过大家讨论，她们都感动了，不但不再吵了，王大娘愿意赔偿，沈大妈却坚决不收，最后，双方一致同意用赔偿费来捐献飞机大炮。
    由于坚持了“抗美援朝日”，就督促了爱国公约每条条文都能付之实行。两个多月来，每条爱国公约都没有落空，而且获得了很大的成绩。
  推动了政治学习和文化学习
    原来他们十六户中没有订一份报纸。为了执行爱国公约中“读报”的一条，大家便凑了钱，订了一份人民日报，每天轮流在各家传阅，第二天由组长收回，统一保存。开始时，他们感到报纸大，内容多，不知看那样好，于是，大家便想了个办法：由文化水平较高的人把重要的划出来；有时看到了很好的材料，便放到“抗美援朝日”上去讲解讨论。但是，有些家庭妇女不认得字，不能看报，只能等到在“抗美援朝日”上听别人讲解，她们感到很不满足，感到有学文化的必要。可是，她们家里有小孩，事情又多，没法抽身去上夜校。她们把这个困难问题提到“抗美援朝日”上。经过大家讨论后，当场决定由四个认得字的家庭妇女，分工来教六个不识字的家庭妇女认字。
  团结互助亲如一家
    在过去，十六户虽然同住在一条胡同里，可是从不爱串门，谁也不管谁，积极分子有事找大家商量，有的居民群众爱理不理，背后还说：“这么积极，一月挣多少小米？”经过抗美援朝运动后，爱国公约上订了大家要团结互助一条。两个多月来，情况就大变了。该胡同居民杨广元在邮局做事，他便把十六户的一切寄信、取汇款、取邮包等事全给包下了，他说：“我上下班，一顺手就办成了。”大家开始觉得团结互助对大家的好处了。
    有一位沈老太太租住的房子，因为多年失修，碰到大雨，就有倒塌的危险。像过去有谁来管这样的事呢？但是自从有了爱国公约以后，就不同了。该胡同爱国公约组长郭俊卿知道这种情形后，立刻去和四号的阚家商量。阚家自动邀请沈老太太住到他家去，直到她修好房子后再搬回去。
    从这些事实中不难看到这条胡同的户与户之间、人与人之间的关系，是正在发生着一种巨大的变革。
  增产捐献飞机大炮
    自从四月二十日订立爱国公约后，他们就按月给志愿军寄书报，写慰问信，报告他们执行爱国公约的情况。六月一日抗美援朝总会发出三大号召后，他们不但把“节约储蓄”改成“捐献飞机大炮”，更想出各种办法来增产捐献。现在已有十四个家庭妇女组成了“抗美援朝生产组”，远到北新桥去领取合作社拆缝二百多双布袜的定活，除去车钱外，她们将所得工资全部捐献。此外，妇女们又糊了两斤纸袋来卖钱捐献。杨广元的妻子会缝纫，她的增产计划是：给别人缝衣只要半价（表示团结互助）扣除成本以外的全部工资，都用来捐献飞机大炮。她们增产的收入，虽然有限，但她们的这种爱国热情，却愈来愈高涨。她们说：“为了捐献飞机大炮，早日打败美帝国主义，我们能干什么，便干什么！”
  养成爱清洁爱劳动的习惯
    每到早上五六点钟的时候，参加“清洁互助组”的妇女们，便习惯地起床了，她们扫好自己的院子，就扫西巷胡同。然后又跑出本胡同，去打扫二龙路的大街。当住户们还在睡觉的时候，她们已扫完大街，愉快地回家。在今天，这个工作对于她们是很愉快的事、像做自己的事一样。但就在她们中间的有些人，在订公约以前，是连自己的屋子也不大愿意打扫的。“清洁互助组”中有个姓张的姑娘，原来每天要中午十二时才起床，起身后第一件事便是煮饭吃饭，吃完饭便把门一关，假使要请她扫街，那比登天还要难。现在她却成扫街的积极分子了。还有个开营造厂的袁老太太，只顾自己干净，从不管别人的。自从订公约后，一次次的“抗美援朝日”教育了她。她看到快到夏天了，却还有四家的厕所没有木盖，她便自动给做了四块木盖，而且送去很多白灰。她不但坚持不收钱，并且说：“这也是抗美援朝！”
    就是这样，西巷胡同的人们喜欢和别人谈他们的爱国公约，更喜欢过他们的“抗美援朝日”。
