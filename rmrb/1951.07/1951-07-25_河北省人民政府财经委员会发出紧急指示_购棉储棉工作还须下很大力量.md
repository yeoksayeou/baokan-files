The Hebei Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee issued an urgent directive:
　　
More Effort Still Needed for Cotton Purchase and Storage
    The province has only completed slightly over 32% of the four-month total task by mid-July.
    It is necessary to overcome departmentalism, organize all forces, and strive to complete the task.

On July 13th, representatives from the Xingtai, Handan, Hengshui, Dingxian, and Tianjin special districts of Hebei Province reported on the cotton purchase and storage work to the Hebei Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee in Baoding. According to the reports, Xingtai Special District has drawn over 900 cadres at the county level and above, as well as over 120 middle school students, to go to the countryside, organize various forces, mobilize cotton farmers, and launch a patriotic cotton sales and storage movement. On July 13th, Handan Special District drew approximately 700 in-service cadres from the special district level, as well as students and teachers from party schools, cadre training classes, middle schools, normal schools, and teacher training classes, to form work teams and distribute them to various counties to assist in carrying out cotton purchase and storage work locally. The counties also organized cadres and all students from party schools, normal schools, and training classes to assist district and village work. They also proposed that aphid control and cotton harvesting must be combined. Since the comprehensive mobilization in Dingxian Special District on July 7th, all villages have been mobilized. From the perspective of the cotton intake figures for the entire Hebei Province, the average daily intake from July 9th to 11th increased by 13.4% compared to the average daily intake from July 1st to 3rd. However, the cotton intake in individual special districts decreased significantly, such as a 55% decrease in Baoding Special District. The overall situation is gradually increasing, but it is still far from the planned cotton purchase and storage task. The first half of July has passed, and the province has currently only completed 32.68% of the total cotton purchase and storage task for the four months of May, June, July, and August. Therefore, all localities still need to make great efforts and cannot be blindly optimistic in the slightest. To this end, the Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee issued an emergency directive on July 15th entitled "Further Develop Cotton Purchase and Storage Work," reminding localities to pay attention to the following matters:

    First, rely on the existing experience of mobilizing cotton farmers and take another great, comprehensive, and in-depth step. We should help the work of lower levels at each level, constantly analyze the thoughts of cadres and cotton farmers, summarize more experience, and improve step by step, to strengthen the confidence of cadres in completing this political task of cotton purchase and storage.

    Second, grasp the overall situation. Efforts should be appropriately divided in terms of the use of forces, overcoming the bias of emphasizing cotton purchase over cotton storage, emphasizing cotton-producing areas over general areas, emphasizing large households over small households or emphasizing small households over large households. It is impossible to complete the overall task of cotton purchase and storage by only focusing on a few key areas.

    Third, do a good job of competition with the district as the unit. Stipulate that inspections should be carried out every few days. After the inspection, compare results and experiences, commend the good ones, and award prizes on the spot; promptly criticize and correct deviations.

    Fourth, if the relationship between state-owned companies and cooperatives is uncoordinated, the responsible cadres at the higher level should personally understand the situation and effectively resolve it, and should never delay. Wherever the cooperative has a good foundation and can ensure the completion of the overall cotton purchase and storage task, the company will not purchase. Conversely, if it is not fully guaranteed, then appropriate division of labor must be made. Company agencies must not be easily withdrawn, and the withdrawal of company agencies in the future must be approved by the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee. Cadres must be educated to proceed from the overall situation, and the central task is to quickly collect all the cotton. Therefore, we must oppose the thinking of disregarding whether the overall task of cotton purchase and storage is completed and proceeding solely from one-sided departmental interests.

    Fifth, try every means to satisfy the material supply of cotton farmers. Relevant provincial departments will organize forces to go down to solve the problem locally. If the state is unable to produce and transport enough, we should also patiently mobilize the masses to store cotton, explain the situation clearly, and guarantee that cotton sold now will definitely be delivered in the future.

    Sixth, prevent coercion and commandism. If any are found, stop them immediately, and do not be paralyzed. There are instances in Zhuoxian County of assigning quotas to households and publicizing that not selling cotton for storage is illegal, and these should be corrected immediately.

    Seventh, continue to strengthen market management and do not give private merchants any chance to take advantage of. In individual areas, there are still phenomena of price decoupling in the market, such as in Anci, Tangxian, and Weixian counties, and management should be strengthened immediately. (Hebei Daily)

### 河北省人民政府财经委员会发出紧急指示  购棉储棉工作还须下很大力量

　　河北省人民政府财经委员会发出紧急指示
　  购棉储棉工作还须下很大力量
    全省至七月半只完成四个月总任务百分之三十二强
    必须克服本位主义组织各方面的力量争取完成任务
    七月十三日河北省的邢台、邯郸、衡水、定县、天津五个专区派代表到保定河北省人民政府财政经济委员会汇报购棉储棉工作。据汇报，邢台专区县级以上已抽调九百多干部及一百二十多中学生下乡，组织各方面力量发动棉农，开展爱国售棉储棉运动。邯郸专区十三日抽调专区级在职干部和党校、干训班、中学、师范学生及教员训练班教员约七百人，组成工作队，分到各县，协助当地开展购棉储棉工作；各县也组织干部及党校、师范、训练班学生全体出动，协助区村工作；并提出治蚜收棉必须结合进行。定县专区自七月七日再次全面动员后，各村已动了起来。从河北全省的收入棉花数字上看，七月九日至十一日平均每日收量比七月一日至三日每日平均收量增百分之十三点四；个别专区收棉量大降，如保定专区收量降低了百分之五十五。总的情况是徐徐上增，但仍距预定的购棉储棉任务甚远。七月上半月已过，全省五、六、七、八四个月的购储棉花总任务现在仅完成百分之三十二点六八。因此，各地仍需下大力进行，丝毫不能盲目乐观。为此，省人民政府财政经济委员会特于七月十五日发出“进一步开展购棉储棉工作”的紧急指示，提示各地注意以下事项：
    第一、依靠发动棉农的已有经验，再大大地全面地深入一步。应逐级切实帮助下级的工作，时刻分析干部和棉农思想，总结更多的经验，步步提高，以坚定干部完成购棉储棉这一政治任务的信心。
    第二、全面掌握。力量使用上应适当分工，克服重购棉轻储棉，重棉区轻一般区，重大户轻小户或重小户轻大户的偏向；只搞几个重点，购棉储棉总任务是不可能完成的。
    第三、以区为单位搞好竞赛。规定几日一检查，检查后，比成绩、比经验，好的表扬，并当场发奖；偏差及时批评纠正。
    第四、国营公司、合作社关系不协调的，上级负责干部要亲自了解情况，切实解决，决不应拖延。凡是合作社基础好，确能保证完成总的购棉储棉任务的，公司即不收购。反之，如果不能完全有把握的保证，则必须适当分工，不能轻易使公司收摊，以后收撤公司机构，须经省财政经济委员会批准。教育干部必须从整体出发，中心是把棉花全部迅速收上来，因此必须反对不顾购棉储棉总任务完成与否，专从片面的本位利益出发的思想。
    第五、想尽办法，尽量满足棉农的物资供应。省级各有关部门再组织力量下去就地解决。国家实在生产运输不及的，亦应向群众耐心动员储棉，交代清楚，并保证现在售棉，将来一定交货。
    第六、防止强迫命令。一有发现，立刻制止，不要麻痹。涿县有按户摊派的，有宣传不卖棉储棉为犯法的，都应马上纠正。
    第七、继续加强市场管理，不给私商以任何可乘之机。个别地区仍有牌市价脱节现象，如安次、唐县、魏县等地，应即加强管理。（河北日报）
