　　All Work for Resisting America, Aiding Korea Should Be Further Strengthened.
    We Must Be Vigilant Against Enemy Conspiracies at All Times.
    A Strong National Defense Guarantees Peace.
   (1) To the Editors:
    The Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations Forces" in Korea, Ridgway, has expressed his "willingness" to accept the proposal of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, to hold ceasefire and armistice negotiations with the Chinese and Korean People's forces. The Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers have also agreed to hold ceasefire and armistice negotiations with Ridgway. The US government's expression of "willingness" to accept Malik's proposal demonstrates the immense power of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union; it also demonstrates the deepening contradictions within the US ruling clique and between the United States and its vassal states.
    The US ruling clique clearly sees that their war of aggression against Korea is a "bottomless pit"; they are constantly quarreling internally; and the rifts between the United States and its vassal states are widening. Therefore, the US government's expression of "willingness" to accept Malik's proposal is out of helplessness, without a doubt. However, despite the deepening contradictions within the US ruling clique, and despite the widening rifts between the United States and its vassal states, their imperialist nature remains consistent. They are constantly planning to undermine world peace and launch new wars of aggression. Precisely because of this, although the US government has now expressed its willingness to accept Malik's proposal, we have no reason to entertain any thoughts of complacency. The People's Daily editorial of July 3rd clearly pointed out: "We must seriously note that a ceasefire and armistice are not yet facts; the current fact is still war. ... All work for resisting America and aiding Korea in the rear and throughout the country must not be relaxed in the slightest until a ceasefire and armistice are truly achieved. Even after the armistice is achieved, the construction of national defense is still very important. We must have a strong national defense force to effectively oppose possible future conspiracies of aggression by imperialism."
    After the news was published in the newspapers that Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai had notified Ridgway of their agreement to hold Korean armistice negotiations, it aroused a one-sided optimistic idea among some of the masses, especially urban residents and the industrial and commercial sectors, who believed that there was no need to resist America and aid Korea now. Therefore, it is very necessary to earnestly study the People's Daily editorial of July 3rd. I hope that the Party and League branches of various organizations, factories, schools, and rural areas can call on Party and League members and the masses to earnestly study the People's Daily editorial of July 3rd; the Party and League branches of various units, Party propagandists, mass activists, etc., should systematically publicize the People's Daily editorial of July 3rd and subsequent statements on this issue to the masses, publicize the aggressive nature of US imperialism, and publicize the truth that all work for resisting America and aiding Korea must continue to be strengthened and cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

    I have read the news about the Korean armistice talks. This news shows that the imperialists, in view of the invincibility of the people's power, are willing to agree to peace. But my opinion is: no matter what the outcome of the armistice is, we must continue to work hard to build national defense and not neglect or relax for a moment. As for the vigorous campaign to donate airplanes and cannons to resist America and aid Korea, which is currently underway, it must continue as before, and we must not be complacent. We must work harder and harder!

            (3) To the Editors:
    After seeing the news in the newspaper about General Kim Il-sung and our Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai's reply to Ridgway's notification, we conducted extensive discussions. Regarding this, we have the following opinions:
    1. We support General Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai's reply to Ridgway regarding the notification of Korean armistice negotiations.
    2. We should strive to actively fight for peace, tell the world's people about our wishes, and expose all conspiracies and deceptions of US imperialism at any time. We must intensify our work to resist America and aid Korea, prepare our strength, and strike at US imperialist aggression at any time!
    Sincerely,

    On the evening of the first of this month, many workers listened to the radio broadcast, and after the important news of the Korean peace talks was published in the newspaper on the 2nd, many workers began to talk about it. Some workshops launched discussions, and some workers said: We must work hard to produce, support Korea, donate generously, purchase airplanes and cannons, and strengthen the national defense of our great motherland. Zhang Xiangpeng said: "During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the United States attempted to use the 'Three-Man Group' to delay time in order to carry out a war against the people. We must be vigilant and prevent his trickery, and never fall for his trap!" Liu Hongliang said: "We must guard against the 'tricks' of the United States. We must strengthen all work for resisting America and aiding Korea and strengthen our strength."

### 一切抗美援朝工作都应当继续加强  我们随时要提防敌人的阴谋  建设强大国防和平才有保证

　　一切抗美援朝工作都应当继续加强
    我们随时要提防敌人的阴谋
    建设强大国防和平才有保证
   （一）编辑同志：
    朝鲜“联合国军”总司令李奇微业已表示“愿意”接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克的提议，准备与中朝人民部队举行停火和停战谈判。朝鲜人民军总司令和中国人民志愿军司令员也已同意和李奇微举行停火和停战谈判。美国政府之表示“愿意”接受马立克的提议，说明了中朝人民和以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量强大无比；也说明了美国统治集团内部和美国及其附庸国家之间的矛盾日益加深。
    美国统治集团很清楚地看到他们的侵朝战争是个“无底洞”；他们内部争吵不息；美国与其附庸国家之间的裂痕日益扩大。因此，美国政府表示“愿意”接受马立克的提议，是出于无可奈何，这是毫无疑问的。但，尽管美国统治集团内部的矛盾日益加深，尽管美国与其附庸国家之间的裂痕日益扩大，他们帝国主义者的本质却是一致的。他们时时都在计划着破坏世界和平，发动新的侵略战争。正因为如此，所以，现在美国政府虽然业已表示愿意接受马立克的提议，但是，我们没有任何可以产生太平思想的理由。人民日报七月三日社论明确地指出：“必须严重地注意：停火和停战目前还不是事实，目前的事实还是战争。……在后方在全国的一切抗美援朝工作，在停火和停战真正实现以前，同样不能有丝毫的松懈。即在停战实现以后，国防的建设还是十分重要的。我们必须有强大的国防力量才能有力地反对帝国主义在今后的可能的阴谋侵略。”
    在各报发表了关于金日成、彭德怀两将军通知李奇微同意举行朝鲜停战谈判的消息后，引起了部分群众，特别是市民和工商界的片面的乐观思想，认为现在可以不抗美援朝了。因此，认真地学习人民日报七月三日的社论，是十分必要的。我希望各机关、工厂、学校、农村的党、团支部，能够号召党、团员和群众认真地学习人民日报七月三日的社论；各单位的党、团支部、党的宣传员、群众积极分子等，要有计划地向群众宣传人民日报七月三日的社论和以后的有关这一问题的言论，要宣传美帝国主义的侵略本质，宣传一切抗美援朝工作必须继续加强，不能有丝毫松懈的道理。

            （二）
    顷阅报载有关于朝鲜停战商谈的消息。这个消息，就表明了帝国主义者鉴于人民的力量是不可侮的，才肯同意和平。但我的意见是：不论停战的成果如何，仍要努力建设国防，不可一时忽视与松懈。至于目前正在轰轰烈烈开展着的抗美援朝捐献飞机大炮运动，仍要照旧进行，切莫心存观望。我们还要努力，再努力！
                                        魏博丞
            （三）编辑同志：
    我们看到报载金日成将军和我们志愿军司令员彭德怀将军答复李奇微的通知后，进行了漫谈讨论。对此，我们有以下的意见：
    一、我们拥护金日成将军和彭德怀将军答复李奇微关于朝鲜停战谈判的通知。
    二、我们应努力积极争取和平，把我们的意愿告诉全世界人民，并随时揭发美国帝国主义一切阴谋欺骗。我们更要加紧我们抗美援朝工作，准备力量，随时给美帝国主义侵略行为以打击！
    此致敬礼

    本月一日晚上，有许多工人听到了无线电的广播，及二日报纸发表朝鲜和平谈判的重要消息后，很多工人纷纷谈起来了。有的工场展开了讨论，一部分工人谈：我们还要努力生产，支援朝鲜，大量捐献，购买飞机大炮，增强伟大祖国的国防力量。张象彭说：“在第三次国内革命战争中，美国企图利用三人小组拖延时间，以便进行反人民的战争。我们一定要提高警惕，防止他的鬼计，千万不要上他的当！”刘洪亮说：“美国的‘花招’，我们一定要防备。我们一定要加强一切抗美援朝的工作，壮大我们的力量。”
