Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 16th dispatch from TASS: On July 15th, the people of Tehran held a demonstration to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the bloody events in Khuzestan. The incident five years ago was instigated by the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in which 47 workers were killed and 170 workers were injured. Approximately 100,000 workers, students, progressive intellectuals, artists, etc., participated in the demonstration, which was organized by the National Association for the Struggle Against Imperialist Oil Companies in Iran.

The demonstration began at 6:00 PM. Dense crowds of demonstrators gathered in Ferdowsi Square, holding various banners and long flags with slogans against the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, demanding immediate nationalization of the entire oil industry, and an end to interference in Iran's internal affairs by British and American imperialists. There were also slogans protesting Harriman's arrival in Tehran.

The demonstration marched along three main streets in the city. At 8:00 PM, they arrived at Baharestan Square, preparing to hold a mass rally in front of the Parliament. However, police in the square blocked their way, firing tear gas and bullets, resulting in some deaths and injuries. The rally was therefore unable to take place.

The banners held by the demonstrators bore the following slogans: "Harriman Get Out of Iran Immediately!" "We Will Never Accept the Ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague!" "British and American Warships Withdraw from Iranian Territorial Waters and the Bahrain Islands!" "The Oil Industry Must Be Completely Nationalized!" "Freedom Must Be Granted to All Political Parties and Trade Unions!" "Glory to the Workers Who Died in Khuzestan in 1946!"

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Truman's special diplomatic advisor, Harriman, arrived in Tehran on the 15th.

The United States has long sought to completely control Iran's oil resources. Since the nationalization of Iranian oil, secret envoys from several American oil trusts have arrived in Tehran ahead of Harriman. The Chief of Operations and Training of the U.S. Army, Taylor, also arrived in Tehran on the 12th to "inspect" the U.S. military delegation in Iran. Meanwhile, Acheson is in Washington negotiating with the Iranian ambassador to the United States, following the wishes of several American oil companies.

These conspiratorial activities of the United States have not only aroused the anger of the Iranian people but have also aroused suspicion and dissatisfaction in Britain. British Ambassador to Tehran, Sir Shepherd, expressed indifference to Harriman's arrival. He told the press that Harriman's arrival had not been approved by Britain. He said that it was "unusual" to try to mediate without the consent of the parties concerned. Shepherd also officially stated that Harriman's trip to Tehran was "of little significance."

　　德黑兰十万群众举行反帝示威
　  抗议哈里曼赴伊反对帝国主义干涉内政
　  示威群众竟遭受伊朗警察的拦阻和杀伤
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰十六日讯：七月十五日，德黑兰群众举行示威，纪念库齐斯坦血腥事件的五周年。五年前的事件是前英伊石油公司所挑拨出来的，在那次事件中有四十七名工人被杀害，一百七十名工人受伤。大约有十万工人、学生、进步知识分子、艺术家等等参加了这次伊朗反帝国主义石油公司斗争全国协会主持的示威。
    示威于下午六时开始。密密层层的示威队伍在费多西广场汇集，他们手执各种标语牌和长旗，上面写着反对前英伊石油公司并要求立即把全部石油工业收归国有、终止英美帝国主义者对伊朗内政的干涉的标语。此外还有抗议哈里曼来到德黑兰的口号。
    示威队伍浩浩荡荡地走过市内三条大街。到下午八时，他们抵达巴哈里斯坦广场，准备到下院前面举行群众大会。但是，广场上的警察拦断了他们的去路，向他们发射催泪弹和枪弹，有些人被杀和受伤。大会因而未能举行。
    示威者手持的标语牌上写着下列标语：“哈里曼立即滚出伊朗！”“决不接受海牙国际法庭的裁决！”“英美军舰撤出伊朗领海和巴林群岛！”“必须彻底将石油工业收归国有！”“各政党和工会必须有自由！”“光荣归于一九四六年在库齐斯坦死难的工人们！”
    【新华社十七日讯】杜鲁门的外交特别顾问哈里曼于十五日飞抵德黑兰。
    美国许久以来即力图完全控制伊朗的石油富源。自伊朗石油国有化事件发生后，美国几个石油托辣斯的秘密使节已先哈里曼到达德黑兰。美国陆军作战训练处处长泰勒也在十二日到德黑兰“视察”美国驻伊朗的军事代表团。同时，艾奇逊正在华盛顿按照几家美国石油公司的愿望，和伊朗驻美大使进行谈判。
    美国的这些阴谋活动，不但引起伊朗人民的愤怒，甚至也引起英国的怀疑和不满。英国驻德黑兰大使谢佩德对哈里曼的到来，即表示冷淡。他对报界说：哈里曼的到来没有得到英国的同意。他说：没有得到当事人的同意，就想出面调解是“不合习惯”的。谢佩德还正式发表声明，说哈里曼的德黑兰之行“没有多大意义”。
