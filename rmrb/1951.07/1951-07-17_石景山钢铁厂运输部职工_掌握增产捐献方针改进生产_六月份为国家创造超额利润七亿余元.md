Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Employees of the Transportation Department of the state-owned Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have achieved great results in the production increase and donation campaign, and have improved production work in all aspects during the campaign. In June, the employees of the department created a surplus profit of 728 million yuan for the country by increasing the turnover of vehicles. Half of the bonuses obtained from creating the surplus profit will be used to donate to purchase airplanes and cannons. All employees also took one hour of their spare time every day in June to participate in the construction of a project of the factory, and have received nearly 70 million yuan in voluntary labor wages, which have also been donated in full. Adding the individual donations of wages in the early stage of the campaign, the donation achievements of the employees of the department are quite considerable.
　　At the beginning of June, when the donation campaign started, the employees of the department were very enthusiastic, but most of them thought that they had to take money out of their original wages to be considered a donation and to express their patriotic enthusiasm. Later, thanks to the factory leadership's explanation of the policy of increasing production and donating, the employees turned their patriotic enthusiasm to production. Based on the fact that the turnover rate of vehicles in the department was only 1.3 times per day, and they had to spend 30 million yuan per day to rent a batch of vehicles from outside the factory, the employees determined that the goal of increasing production was to gradually increase the turnover rate of vehicles, and by the end of September, to create a surplus profit of 1.4 billion yuan for the country. In view of the fact that the surplus profits of state-owned enterprise employees should be uniformly distributed by the state, and employees can only donate the bonuses obtained from creating surplus profits, the employees of the department then decided, based on the actual situation that the turnover rate of vehicles in June had increased from 1.3 times to 1.71 times per day and exceeded the original production increase plan, to revise the number of surplus profits for a period of six months from 1.4 billion yuan to 10.5 billion yuan, and donate half of the bonus from this surplus profit to purchase airplanes.
　　In the production increase and donation campaign in June, all employees of the department improved production in all aspects and increased the turnover rate of vehicles. In the past, the department had insufficient contact with other departments, and often other departments temporarily needed materials or vehicles, so that the turnover rate of vehicles could not be improved in a planned way. Now, a transportation plan has been formulated according to the material usage time of other departments, changing the previous chaotic phenomenon. In the past, there was also insufficient contact between the vehicle management section and the loading and unloading section, so that sometimes the carriages arrived but the loading and unloading workers did not, and sometimes the loading and unloading workers arrived but the carriages did not, often wasting labor and accumulating carriages. Now both sides have established a forecast system, and the phenomenon of carriages waiting for people and people waiting for carriages has been almost eliminated. In the past, it was necessary to wait for three days for the slag with a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius to cool down before unloading, but now the workers pour water into the slag, and it can be unloaded in half an hour, greatly reducing the accumulation time of carriages. The locomotive section has also shortened the time for fueling, watering, and coaling locomotives from half an hour to a quarter of an hour, thus shortening the vehicle stop time. These efforts have reduced the non-turnover time of vehicles from 39 percent of the total transportation time in May to 15 percent in June.

### 石景山钢铁厂运输部职工  掌握增产捐献方针改进生产  六月份为国家创造超额利润七亿余元

　  掌握增产捐献方针改进生产
　  六月份为国家创造超额利润七亿余元
    【新华社十五日讯】国营石景山钢铁厂运输部职工增产捐献运动已获很大成绩，在运动中从各方面改进了生产工作。该部职工六月份因提高车辆周转次数，已为国家创造超额利润七亿二千八百万元，因创造超额利润而获得的奖金的半数将用来捐献购买飞机大炮。全体职工还在六月份每天工余时间内抽出一小时参加该厂某项工程的建设工作，已得到义务劳动工资近七千万元，也全部捐献出来。加上运动初期个别捐献的工资，该部职工的捐献成绩已相当可观。
    六月初，当捐献运动开始时，该部职工热情很高，但一般的都以为一定要从自己原有工资中拿出钱来才算捐献，才能表达自己的爱国热情。后来，由于该厂领导上说明了增产捐献的方针，职工们才把爱国热情转到生产上去。职工们根据该部车辆周转次数每天只达一点三次而不得不每天花费三千万元租金向厂外租用一批车辆的情况，确定增产目标是：把车辆周转次数逐步提高，到九月底止，为国家创造出十四亿元的超额利润。鉴于国营企业职工增产的超额利润应由国家统一支配，而职工捐献只能用创造超额利润所得到的奖金，该部职工接着又根据六月份车辆周转次数已由每天一点三次提高到一点七一次而超过原订增产计划的实际情况，决定以半年为期将增产超额利润的数目由十四亿元改订为一百零五亿元，以此超额利润所得的奖金的半数捐献出来购买飞机。
    在六月份增产捐献运动中，该部全体职工曾从各方面改进生产，提高车辆周转次数。该部过去由于和其他部门联系不够，往往因其他部门临时要料、临时调车，以致车辆周转次数不能有计划地提高。现已根据其他部门用料时间订出运输计划，改变了以往的混乱现象。该部车务股与装卸股之间过去也因联系不够，以致有时车皮去了而装卸工人没到、有时装卸工人到了而车皮没来，常常浪费劳力和积压车皮。现在双方已建立了预报制度，车等人、人等车的现象已近于消灭。过去运送摄氏二百度高温的矿碴，要等三天冷却后才卸车，现在工人在矿碴里浇上水，半小时后就可卸车，大大减少了车皮积压时间。机务股也将机车给油给水给煤时间，由半小时缩短为一刻钟，因而缩短了车辆停留时间。这些努力，便使车辆非周转时间由五月份占整个运输时间的百分之三十九减为六月份的百分之十五。
