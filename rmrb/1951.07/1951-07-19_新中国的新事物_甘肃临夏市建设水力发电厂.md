　　New Things in New China: Construction of a Hydroelectric Power Plant in Linxia City, Gansu
To the Editor:
    I want to tell you about a new thing. The jointly public-private Min Sheng Hydroelectric Power Plant in Linxia City, Gansu Province, has been successfully built after more than a year of efforts under the leadership of the People's Government and the hard work of the workers. Currently, Linxia City is installing electric wires and lights, and by August 1st, the whole city will be brightly lit. This is truly a joyous event for the people of Linxia City. Before liberation, the reactionary ruling class only knew how to exploit the people. The local people lived a life of suffering and darkness, unable to eat their fill or keep themselves warm, and they couldn't even afford kerosene lamps, so how could they dare to dream of using electric lights? After Linxia City was liberated in August 1949, men and women, young and old, were filled with joy, and the people's lives gradually improved. The people of the Hui, Han, and Tibetan ethnic groups in Linxia, seeing that a hydroelectric power plant was built soon after liberation, praised in unison: "This is the good leadership of Chairman Mao, this is the great achievement of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army."

　  新中国的新事物  甘肃临夏市建设水力发电厂编辑同志：
    我告诉你一件新事物。甘肃临夏市公私合营的民生水力发电厂，经过人民政府的领导和工人同志一年多的努力，已经建设成功了。目前临夏市正在装设电线电灯，到八月一日，全市将要大放光明。这实在是临夏市人民的一件喜事。在解放以前，反动统治阶级只知道搜刮人民。当地老百姓过着痛苦黑暗的生活，吃不饱，穿不暖，连煤油灯都点不起，那里还敢想到用电灯呢？临夏市于一九四九年八月解放后，男女老幼喜气洋洋，人民生活逐渐改善。临夏回、汉、藏等民族的人民看到解放后不久就建设了水力发电厂，一致称颂说：“这是毛主席的好领导，这是共产党和解放军的大功劳。”
