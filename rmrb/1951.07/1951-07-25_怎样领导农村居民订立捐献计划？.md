　　How to Lead Rural Residents in Formulating Donation Plans?
　　Feng Luren
    Since the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the call for donating airplanes and cannons on June 1st, the vast number of peasants across the country have launched a vigorous patriotic movement to increase production and donate. In order to combine the donation movement with increased production and increased income, the vast number of peasants in Henan, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu have already formulated plans for increasing production and donating. Many peasants in the northeastern provinces and parts of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, Northern Sichuan, Xikang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, as well as the suburbs of Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhu, Guangzhou, and other cities, have also formulated plans for increasing production and donating. Facts have proven that wherever plans for increasing production and donation are formulated among rural residents, the donation movement is very enthusiastically carried out. However, from a national perspective, the majority of rural residents have not yet formulated plans for increasing production and donation, and the development of the movement is still very uneven. Therefore, universally carrying out the work of formulating plans for increasing production and donation among the vast number of rural residents remains an extremely important task in rural work.

    So, how to lead rural residents in formulating donation plans?

    First, it is necessary to ensure that every peasant understands the significant role of this movement to increase production and donate in supporting the front lines, consolidating national defense, promoting agricultural production, and further improving the lives of peasants, and that they all understand the principle of using increased production and increased income as a method for donating airplanes and cannons. To this end, we must fully mobilize all possible propaganda forces in rural areas and apply various propaganda methods to once again universally conduct propaganda on increasing production and donation among the vast number of peasants. Xin’an Village in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, provided good experience in this regard. The village leadership first mobilized all propaganda forces to publicize increasing production and donation. Initially, the peasant masses did not have a clear understanding of the principle of "increasing production and donation," and did not understand that increasing production and donation should be combined, mistakenly believing that donation was just everyone donating some money. Some were also afraid of having to pay immediately. Based on this situation, the village propagandists and newspaper reading group members conducted repeated and in-depth propaganda through various meetings and field rest times, explaining that donation should be done through increasing production, and that there was a six-month period for donation, which could be done after increasing production. This eliminated the peasants' concerns about increasing production and donation, and they successively formulated plans for increasing production and donation. Because the village universally formulated plans for increasing production and donation, the leadership and the peasants had a clear picture in mind, had goals to strive for, and were very confident, and they all voluntarily reported their donation figures. Because Xin’an Village did a good job in promoting increasing production and donation, it not only achieved great success in donation but also further deepened the education of patriotism through the movement to increase production and donation, and the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the peasant masses were unprecedentedly improved, directly promoting the patriotic movement to increase production.

    In order to do a good job in increasing production and donation among the people, it is first necessary to educate all village and township cadres. Because some village and township cadres themselves do not have a correct understanding of the meaning and methods of increasing production and donation, it has been found in many places that village and township cadres have adopted the method of forced quotas or asking peasants to take money out of their pockets to donate weapons. For example, a cadre in Chengling District, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, said to the peasant masses: "After the land reform, you all received land. If you don't donate airplanes and cannons today, you are forgetting your roots." Such "propaganda" not only cannot improve the political awareness of the peasants but also aroused resentment among the masses. A village cadre in the suburbs of Beijing went door-to-door with a list to "solicit donations," and the masses donated very little. The Second District of Linfen, Shanxi, confused donation with burden, and even determined that the masses should "bear an additional 100,000 jin of grain." Cadres in Songjia Street, Sixth District, Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, generally had the simple idea of "completing the donation task is not a problem" by simply taking money out of their pockets in the donation movement. The peasant masses also said: "Our country doesn't ask us for money in many places, what does it matter to donate a few dollars!" This deviation must be resolutely overcome.

    Second, we must, according to the specific conditions of each rural area and the different conditions of various people, and according to the farming season, mobilize the peasants to use their brains and think of ways to concentrate the wisdom of the peasants to formulate the peasants' plans for increasing production and donation. As long as we proceed from reality and follow the mass line, we can formulate practical and feasible production increase plans. For example, the fourteen mutual aid teams in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, in addition to increasing income from agricultural production, planned to extract 27 people after the wheat harvest to cut bamboo, cut brooms, collect firewood, and collect herbs for sideline production. Zhang Village, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, also organized elementary school students in the village to use their spare time and holidays to beat locusts and pick cotton. The production increase plan of the Wang Jinzhuo mutual aid team in Wenji District, Fuyang, Northern Anhui Province, stipulated that in agriculture, meticulous farming should be done, more fertilizer should be applied, pests should be prevented and eliminated, and various sideline productions should be carried out according to different seasons. The production increase plan of Yincun, Lushan County, Henan Province, stipulated that every woman should be mobilized to spin an extra tael or two of cotton. Women, children, and the elderly in Liuhe Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, all planned to go to the fields to pick up crops during the autumn harvest. Farmers in Gaobeidian in the suburbs of Beijing increased production and donation by increasing pig and chicken farming, and women made shoes. All these plans for increasing production and donation are roughly based on their own characteristics and are practical and feasible. These plans not only provide a strong guarantee for donating airplanes and cannons but also fully utilize all labor and semi-labor, which is of great benefit to promoting agricultural production.

    Third, the requirements for increasing production and donation should be appropriate. Overly high requirements cannot be achieved and will affect the peasants' enthusiasm for increasing production. Some rural areas in the Northeast, when formulating plans, overemphasized multi-tillage, formulating unrealistic production increase plans of eight or nine tillages for ordinary crops. A village in the suburbs of Beijing formulated a plan for each household to increase production by ten jin of cotton for donation, and Guoyuan Village proposed a plan to increase production by two and a half percent and donate one and a half percent. The numbers were very large, and there were no ways to increase production, so it was obviously difficult to achieve. Chen Zhongshan, a 59-year-old hired peasant with a family of three in Xin’an Village, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, had just been allocated 27 dan of land (8 dan per mu) and pledged to donate 5 million yuan. But it was estimated that each dan of land could increase rice production by an average of 20 jin at most, and a total of 540 jin of rice could be increased. Selling all the increased production would not be enough for the donation. Therefore, the donation figure of 5 million yuan was too high, and after praising his patriotic enthusiasm, he should be persuaded to reduce the donation figure.

    Fourth, after the production increase and donation plan is formulated, attention should be paid to timely inspection and summary to prevent the phenomenon of putting the plan on the shelf and no longer paying attention to it after it is formulated. During the inspection and summary, if it is found that the plan is impractical and cannot be achieved, necessary revisions or supplements should be made; if difficulties are encountered in increasing production, efforts should be made to study and solve them. At the same time, during the inspection and summary, the role of activists should be correctly used and brought into play. By way of comparison, criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, achievements should be affirmed, role models should be established, and then the shortcomings and deviations arising in this movement should be criticized. This is the best way to enable the people to educate themselves. This method of inspection and summary is an important link to inspire the political awareness of the peasants, ensure the realization of the production increase and donation plan, and make the movement to resist America and aid Korea and the patriotic production increase movement universally and deeply develop.

　　怎样领导农村居民订立捐献计划？
　　冯鲁仁
    自抗美援朝总会六月一日发出捐献飞机大炮的号召后，全国广大的农民展开了轰轰烈烈的爱国增产捐献运动。为了使捐献运动与增加生产、增加收入相结合，目前河南、苏南、苏北等地的广大农民已订出增产捐献计划，东北各省和河北、察哈尔、山西、平原、山东、浙江、福建、皖南、皖北、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、川东、川西、川北、西康、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆的部分地区，以及北京、南京、芜湖、广州等市郊区的许多农民亦纷纷订出增产捐献计划。事实证明：凡是在农村居民中订立增产捐献计划的，捐献运动就开展得很热烈。但是，从全国说来，目前农村居民中没有订立增产捐献计划的还占多数，运动的发展还很不平衡。因此，在广大农村居民中普遍开展订立增产捐献计划的工作，仍然是农村工作中的一项极为重要的任务。
    怎样领导农村居民订立捐献计划呢？
    第一，必须使每个农民都了解这次增产捐献运动对于支援前线、巩固国防、推动农业生产并进一步改善农民生活的重大作用，并使他们都了解一定要用增加生产、增加收入的方法来捐献飞机大炮的方针。为了这个目的，就要充分动员农村中所有可能运用的宣传力量，并应用各种宣传方式，在广大农民中再一次普遍进行增产捐献的宣传工作。浙江新登县新堰村在这方面提供了很好的经验。该村领导上首先动员了所有的宣传力量来宣传增产捐献。起初农民群众对“增产捐献”的方针没有明确的认识，不懂得要把增产和捐献结合起来，错误地认为捐献只不过是大家捐点钱就算了。有的还怕马上要缴款。根据这种情况，该村宣传员、读报组员们通过各种会议、田间休息时间进行了反复的深入宣传，说明捐献要在增产上想办法，而且捐献有半年期限，可以增产之后再捐献，这样就消除了农民对增产捐献的顾虑，他们都相继订立了增产捐献计划。由于该村普遍订立了增产捐献计划，领导上和农民心中都有了数，有了奋斗目标，信心很高，纷纷自报捐献数字。新堰村因为增产捐献宣传工作做得好，不仅在捐献方面获得很大的成绩，并且通过增产捐献运动，进一步深入了爱国主义的教育，农民群众政治觉悟和生产积极性空前提高，直接推动了爱国增产运动。
    为了对人民群众做好增产捐献的工作，首先就必须对所有的乡村工作干部进行一次教育。因为有些乡村工作干部本身对于增产捐献的意义和方法就没有正确的认识，现在不少地方已经发现有乡村干部采取强迫摊派或者叫农民掏腰包的办法来捐献武器。如浙江新登县城岭区有一干部向农民群众说：“土地改革后，你们都分到田地，今天不捐飞机大炮就是忘本。”这样的“宣传”，不仅不能提高农民的政治觉悟，而且引起了群众的反感。北京市郊区某村干部拿着名单挨户“上捐”，群众捐的很少。山西临汾二区把捐献和负担混淆起来，竟确定群众“多负担十万斤粮”。辽西省新民县六区宋家街干部在开展捐献运动中普遍存在“完成捐献任务不成问题”的单纯掏腰包的思想。农民群众也跟着说：“咱们国家多处也不向我们要钱，捐两个钱算什么！”这种偏向，是必须坚决克服的。
    第二，必须按照各个农村的具体情况和各种人的不同条件，并根据农作的季节，发动农民大家动脑筋，想办法，集中农民的智慧来订立农民的增产捐献计划。只要从实际出发，并走群众路线，就能订出切实可行的增产计划来。例如陕西长安县王蟒村十四个互助组除了在农业生产上增加收入外，计划麦收后，抽出二十七人砍竹子、割扫帚、打柴、采药等副业生产。陕西三原县张村并组织该村小学生利用课余及假期，打槐，拾棉花。皖北阜阳闻集区王金琢互助组的增产计划中，规定在农业上做到精耕细作，多施肥，防止和扑灭虫害，并计划按不同季节，开展各种副业生产。河南鲁山县尹村的增产计划中规定动员每个妇女多纺一两花。黑龙江绥化县六合村的妇女、儿童、老年人，都计划在秋收时下地拾庄稼。北京郊区高碑店农民以增加养猪、养鸡，妇女们纳鞋等办法来增产捐献。所有这些增产捐献计划大致都是根据自己的特点来订立的，都是切实可行的，这些计划不但对捐献飞机大炮提供了有力的保证，而且充分使用了所有的劳动力和半劳动力，对于推进农业生产有很大好处。
    第三，增产捐献的要求要适当，过高的要求是不能实现，并且会影响农民的增产积极性的。东北某些农村在订计划时，过分强调了多铲多趟，对普通农作物订出八铲九趟、九铲九趟的不切实际的增产计划。北京市郊某村订出每户增产十斤棉花来捐献的计划，果园村提出增产两成半拿一成半来捐献的计划，数字很大，又无增产办法，显然是很难实现的。浙江新登县新堰村五十九岁的雇农陈中山三口人，刚分了二十七担田（八担一亩），他认捐了五十万元。但估计每担田顶多平均增产稻谷二十斤，共可增产稻谷五百四十斤，把增产所得全部卖出还不够捐献。所以五十万元的捐献数字是太高了，应该在表扬他的爱国热情之后，劝他把捐献数字减少一些。
    第四，增产捐献计划订立后，要注意及时检查总结，防止在订立计划后即束之高阁不再过问的现象。在检查总结中，如发现计划不切实际而无法实现时，应作必要的修正或补充；如遇到在增产上的困难问题，应设法予以研究解决。同时，在检查总结时，应正确地运用与发挥积极分子的作用，以评比的方式，展开批评与自我批评，肯定成绩，树立榜样，然后批判在这一运动中产生的缺点和偏向，这是使人民群众自己教育自己的最好方法。这种检查总结的办法是启发农民的政治觉悟，保证实现增产捐献计划，并使抗美援朝与爱国增产运动普遍深入发展的重要环节。
