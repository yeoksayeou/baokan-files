  Miserable Life of the Japanese People
　　Two figures can illustrate the tragic state of life for the Japanese people under the enslavement of American imperialism:
　　1. In 1948, there were 12,500 private pawnshops across Japan. By the end of last year, this number had increased to 16,600. In addition, the government has opened 50 pawnshops, and plans to add 33 more public pawnshops this year.
　　2. The number of suicides last year—mostly due to economic reasons—increased by 18% compared to the previous year. In the twelve months ending in March of this year, 18,300 people committed suicide, and 4,000 attempted suicide.
　　However, more and more Japanese people have realized that pawning their possessions for a living and committing suicide are not solutions. The only way out is to participate in the struggle for national independence and liberation, and against the enslavement of American imperialism.
  This is Only the Beginning
　　The Bonn puppet "government" has agreed to allow the U.S. Army to use the Hammel district as a training camp. This will affect 21,000 German people. Residents of seven villages will be evicted, and people in another seven villages will lose almost all of their land.
　　American imperialism has already brought much disaster to the German people. It is clear that the U.S. not only intends to use West Germany as a military base, but also conspires to turn it into a battlefield.
  A Pawn on the American War Chariot
　　The Swiss government has ordered a ban on the distribution of leaflets containing the full text of the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact, and has slandered it as "serving foreign political propaganda." The Swiss Peace Committee has filed a protest with the Swiss Federal Council regarding this matter.
　　Supporting the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact is the unanimous demand of people all over the world, including the Swiss people. This heinous act of the Swiss ruling clique demonstrates that it is a pawn serving the war plans of American imperialism.

  日本人民生活悲惨
    从两项数字可以看出在美国帝国主义奴役下，日本人民生活的悲惨状况：
    一、一九四八年日本全国共有私人当铺一万二千五百家，到去年年底又增加到一万六千六百家。此外政府还开设了五十家，今年还要增加三十三家公营的当铺。
    二、去年的自杀人数—大部分由于经济原因—比前年增加了百分之十八。在到今年三月底为止的十二个月期间，有一万八千三百人自杀，有四千人自杀未遂。
    但是，更多的日本人民已经认识到，典当为生与自杀都不是办法，只有参加了争取民族独立解放、反对美帝国主义奴役的斗争才是活路。
  这只不过是开始
    波恩傀儡“政府”已答应美国陆军，将汉麦尔区作为练兵营使用。这要使二万一千名德国人民受到影响。七个村庄的居民将被逐出，另外七个村庄的人民差不多将丧失他们全部的土地。
    美帝国主义已经给德国人民带来了不少的灾祸了。很明显，美国不但企图利用西德作为兵营，而且还阴谋将它变成战场。
  美国兵车上的小卒
    瑞士政府竟下令禁止散发印有世界和平理事会要求缔结和平公约宣言全文的传单，并诽谤为“替外国政治宣传服务”。瑞士和平委员会已为此向瑞士联邦议会提出抗议。
    拥护缔结五大国和平公约是全世界人民也是瑞士人民的一致要求。瑞士统治集团这种罪恶行为说明它是替美帝国主义战争计划服务的走卒。
