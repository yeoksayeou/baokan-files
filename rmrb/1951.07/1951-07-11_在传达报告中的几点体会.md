　　Some Experiences in Conveying Reports
    (Zhang Xiufeng, Youth Representative of the Central and Southern Sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea)

    Editor's Note: We are introducing some experiences of a representative of the delegation to Korea in giving reports, for the reference of representatives from various regions. In order to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and to continue to consolidate national defense and safeguard peace in the Far East, the patriotic movement must continue to advance. It is hoped that representatives in various regions will implement the spirit of the Association's July 4th notification in their reports, and call on the country to continue to strengthen various activities to resist America and aid Korea.

    After returning from our mission of慰问（consolation or paying respect to）in Korea, we accepted the task assigned by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to give reports in various cities and counties across the country. Now, as representatives of various sub-delegations are heading to various regions to work, I am writing down some of my experiences in giving reports in Beijing and Wuhan for the reference of representatives from various regions.

    First, we must recognize the importance of this task, and constantly keep in mind the instructions given to us by the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, taking this opportunity to conduct another widespread and in-depth patriotic education for the people of the country. We must not think of this as a temporary task, and therefore be distracted by the work of our original posts or personal issues while giving reports, which would prevent us from doing a better job of conveying information.

    Second, we must understand the situation before reporting, and ask local responsible comrades to introduce the masses' ideological situation and work focus, so as to be able to give targeted reports. Pay attention to the audience's emotions when speaking, on the one hand, the report time can be appropriately extended or shortened, and on the other hand, pay attention to which examples are most likely to move the audience, and which examples have poor effects, so as to improve next time. After the report meeting, we should take the initiative to solicit opinions from the host and the masses, so as to improve the content and wording of the report and gradually improve it.

    Third, correctly and comprehensively introduce the situation on the Korean front. Clearly tell the audience about the difficulties encountered by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the front lines, how they created ways to overcome all difficulties, and how they developed a high degree of revolutionary heroism and optimism, thus defeating the enemy who was superior to us in equipment, so that everyone knows how to support the Volunteer Army. In the report, neither should we overemphasize the enemy's incompetence, nor should we one-sidedly emphasize our hardship, so as to avoid some people’s ideas of underestimating the enemy or fear of America. The report should pay attention to using more convincing and moving typical examples. However, when introducing the heroic deeds of soldiers, we must explain the specific situation at the time and place. For example, if we tell the story of a soldier who was not afraid of tanks and grabbed prisoners from the tanks, if we do not introduce the terrain and the situation of the enemy and us at the time and place, it will cause people to have illusions, either thinking that the enemy is easy to fight, or thinking that the propaganda is excessive, losing the sense of reality.

    Fourth, be familiar with the material and use it flexibly. Before giving a report, we should classify, sort out, analyze and study the materials sent to us by the general delegation, fully grasp these materials, and then study which materials should be talked about in different regions and to different groups of people. For example, when we give speeches to farmers, if we systematically introduce how some Korean old, weak women completed the spring plowing work under the conditions of lack of people, lack of cattle, lack of seeds, and frequent enemy air raids, it can increase the effect of the report. To do this, we must first have adequate preparation. We must not think that "I have given reports everywhere in the Korean battlefield, completed the慰问（consolation or paying respect to）mission, and collected a lot of materials, so I don't have to worry about what to say when the time comes?" I have heard some comrades say: "The General Association has sent us so much material, how many articles can we use? Isn't it too much trouble to carry it?" This kind of thinking should be corrected.

### 在传达报告中的几点体会

　　在传达报告中的几点体会
    （中国人民赴朝慰问团中南分团青年代表张岫峰）
    编者按：这里介绍一位赴朝慰问团代表作传达报告的一些经验，供各地代表参考。为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为了继续巩固国防，保卫远东的和平，爱国运动必须继续推进。希望各地代表在报告中贯彻本会七月四日通知的精神，号召全国继续加强各项抗美爱国工作。
    我们在赴朝慰问归国之后，又接受了抗美援朝总会所交给的到全国各市、县作传达报告的任务。现在，当各分团代表正分赴各地工作的时候，我把在北京、武汉两地几次作报告中的一些体会写出来，供各地代表参考。
    首先，我们要认识这一任务的重大，要经常想着抗美援朝总会给我们的指示，借此向全国人民进行再一次的普遍、深入的爱国主义教育，千万不要认为这是临时任务，因而一边报告，一边还在考虑原来岗位的工作或个人的问题，分散了注意力，不能把传达工作做得更好。
    第二，报告前要了解情况，要请当地负责同志介绍群众思想情况及工作重心，以便能有的放矢地做传达报告。讲话时要注意听众情绪，一方面可将报告时间适当延长或缩短，另方面也要注意那些例子最能感动听众，那些例子效果不好，以便下次改进。报告会结束后，应主动征求主持人及群众的意见，借以改进报告内容、措辞，使之逐步提高。
    第三，正确地全面地介绍朝鲜前线的情况。把中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在前线遇到的困难，以及他们怎样地创造了克服一切困难的办法，怎样发扬了高度的革命英雄主义和乐观主义，因而战胜了在装备上优于我们的敌人的情形，清楚地告诉听众，使大家知道应该怎样支援志愿军。报告中既不能过分强调敌人的无能，也不能片面地强调我方的艰苦，以免引起某些群众的轻敌思想或恐美情绪。报告中应注意多用具有说服力的、生动感人的典型事例。但在介绍战士英勇事迹时，一定要说明当时当地的具体情况，如我们讲一个战士不怕坦克，从坦克里抓出俘虏的故事，假若不把当时当地的地形和敌我双方情况加以介绍，就会使人发生错觉，不是以为敌人容易打，就是认为宣传过分，失却真实感。
    第四，熟习材料，灵活运用。我们在作报告之前，应该把总团发给我们的材料加以分类整理，分析研究，充分掌握这些材料，然后研究在不同地区对不同群众应讲那些材料。例如我们对农民讲演时，如果系统地介绍一些朝鲜老弱妇女怎样在缺人、缺牛、缺种子和不时受敌机侵扰下胜利完成春耕工作的情况，是可以增加报告的效果的。要作到这一点，首先必须有充分的准备。我们千万不要以为“我在朝鲜战地都到处作了报告，完成了慰问任务，又搜集了很多材料，到时候还愁没啥说？”我曾听到某些同志说：“总会发给我们这么多材料，能用上几篇呢？带着还不够麻烦？”这种思想是应该纠正的。（附图片）
