　　Lack of Long-Term Vision and Thorough Planning

　　Improper Site Selection for the Jinnan Textile Factory

　　Construction Without a Plan Leads to Significant Waste from Rework

    The Shanxi Provincial Textile Company's newly built Jinnan Textile Factory, during its capital construction, lacked long-term vision and thorough planning, resulting in improper site selection and extremely serious waste during construction.

    The Jinnan Textile Factory's site was selected on the old site of a former yarn factory in a town in Xinjiang County. This site has the following serious shortcomings: the factory is only a dozen meters away from the Fen River bank. After heavy rains in July 1934, the Fen River overflowed, and the old yarn factory was flooded by about one foot, which took two days to recede. The site is low-lying, with water just one or two feet below the surface, so the foundations of the factory buildings are very shallow and not strong enough. Moreover, the boiler installation needs to be raised, which increases the difficulty for workers when burning coal. The factory site is thirty-five li away from the Houma Station on the Tongpu Railway, and it is separated by the Fen River. It is estimated that after the textile factory officially starts production, it will need one hundred large carts of coal every day, increasing transportation costs by 100 million yuan per month. Furthermore, if the river floods, transporting coal will be extremely difficult. The factory construction preparatory committee and relevant leading authorities only saw that the old site of the former yarn factory currently had more than a thousand factory buildings, workshops, and dormitories that could be used, thus saving on construction costs, without making long-term plans.

    The factory construction preparatory committee started construction blindly before clarifying its policies and plans. As a result, the plans were not practical, and many aspects of the engineering design needed to be changed. The factory was planned to have 10,000 spindles, but it built factory buildings that could accommodate 20,000 spindles. The original plan was to build 500 cave dwellings (dormitories), but in reality, 50 was enough, resulting in a backlog of a large amount of brick.

    The factory's construction was undertaken by the state-owned Xin Da Construction Company. Construction lacked plans and priorities, and the quality of construction was extremely poor. Warehouses, dormitories, and power rooms were all started at the same time, regardless of importance or urgency, wasting materials and labor and failing to complete the project in a timely manner. At the same time, materials could not be supplied in time, causing a large number of workers to stop work and wait for materials, and creating a chaotic situation of "doing whatever work there are materials for," disrupting the entire project schedule and making it impossible to grasp the seasonality of the project. The construction of many important factory buildings was delayed. After the machines were transported, there were no factory buildings to install them in, resulting in great losses due to sun and rain. Many factory buildings and dormitory cement floors were damaged by frost due to rushing work in the winter. Of the newly built 200 factory buildings, 100 were completely demolished and renovated; most of the other 100 also leaked and needed repair. One hundred dormitories also needed repair due to leaks. Many factory building beams and columns were warped because the wood was not dry. The walls of the power room corridor were distorted after they were built. Warehouse No. 4 was in danger of collapsing just after it was completed. As of now, 268 factory buildings have been re-roofed and rebuilt. General renovation work is not included.

    The factory started preparations in May of last year. After the above problems occurred in the construction work, the factory formulated an annual plan at the beginning of this year, prepared before construction, and initially overcame the waste of manpower and materials.

　　缺乏长远打算和周密计划
　  晋南纺织厂厂址选择不当
　  施工无计划返工浪费很大
    山西省纺织公司新建晋南纺织厂在进行基本建设中，缺乏长远打算和周密计划，结果厂址选择不当，施工中浪费极为严重。
    晋南纺织厂的厂址选择在新绛县某镇原某纱厂的旧址。这个厂址有以下几个严重的缺点：该厂距汾河岸仅十几公尺，一九三四年七月大雨后汾水出岸，旧某纱厂全厂进水一尺左右，两天后才退。厂址地势低凹，地面下掘一尺至二尺就有水，因而厂内房屋建筑根基极浅，不够坚固；而且锅炉按装需要垫高，增加了工人烧煤时的困难。该厂厂址距离同蒲路候马车站三十五华里，中间又隔着汾河。据估计，纺织厂正式开工后，每天需有一百辆大车供应用煤，每月增加运费一亿元。并且，假若河水暴涨，运煤就极为困难。该厂建厂筹备委员会和有关领导机关，只看到目前某纱厂的旧址中有千余间厂房、工作室、宿舍可以利用，这样可以节省一笔修建费用，而未做长远打算。
    该厂建厂筹备委员会对于方针和计划还没有弄明白，就盲目施工。结果计划不切合实际，工程设计有很多地方需要变更。该厂按计划设纱锭一万枚，却建筑了可容两万纱锭的厂房。原计划修五百间窑洞（宿舍），实际上修五十间就够，因此积压了大批砖料。
    该厂工程是由国营新大建筑公司承建的。施工无计划，无重点，建筑质量极差。仓库、宿舍、动力房，不分轻重缓急，一齐动工，浪费了工料，而且不能及时完成工程。同时，材料不能及时供应，使大批工人停工待料，并造成“有什么料，做什么活”的混乱情况，打乱了整个工程进度，工程的季节性也就无法掌握。许多重要厂房的修建被推迟，机器运到后无厂房可安装，日晒雨淋，损失很大。许多厂房宿舍的洋灰地因冬季赶工而冻坏。新建筑的二百间厂房，有一百间全部拆除翻修；另一百间也大部漏雨，需要补修。有一百间宿舍也因漏雨而需补修。很多厂房梁柱因木材不干而呈现弯曲。动力房过道墙壁修成后就呈现歪曲。四号仓库刚修成就有倒塌的危险。截至目前为止，揭顶重修的厂房已有二百六十八间。一般翻修的工程尚不在内。
    该厂是去年五月开始筹建的。修建工作发生上述问题后，今年年初，该厂就制订了全年计划，施工前进行了准备，初步克服了人力物力的浪费。
