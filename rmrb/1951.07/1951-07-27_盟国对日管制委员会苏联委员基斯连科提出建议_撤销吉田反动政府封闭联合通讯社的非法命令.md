　　Allied Council for Japan Soviet Member Kislenko Proposes:
　　Repeal the Illegal Order of the Reactionary Yoshida Government to Close the United Press Agency
    Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, TASS dispatch, July 25th, Tokyo: The persecution of democratic newspapers in Japan continues. Currently, 1,736 types of democratic newspapers and periodicals have been banned from publication. Many workers in the democratic press have been arrested, including correspondents, editorial staff, subscription agents, and journalists. For example, when the "Voice of Peace" newspaper was shut down, approximately hundreds of people were arrested; when the "Laborer" newspaper was suspended, more than three hundred people were arrested.
    On July 12th, Japanese police searched the editorial office of the United Press Agency, confiscating its property and publications, and sealing off the agency. Simultaneously, the police also searched the agency's forty-six branches in many cities across Japan. The United Press Agency was founded in 1948, established with funds from various Japanese trade union organizations. It is the only Japanese news agency that sends news releases to trade unions and democratic groups daily.
    On July 14th, the leadership of the United Press Agency submitted a petition to the members of the Allied Council for Japan, protesting the Japanese government's tyrannical act of infringing upon freedom of speech and publication. It also requested that the members of the Council take measures to revoke the Japanese government's order to dissolve the agency.
    On July 20th, the Allied Council for Japan convened a meeting at the request of Soviet member Major General Kislenko. The Soviet representative read the petition of the United Press Agency at the meeting and proposed revoking the Japanese government's illegal order, as it violates the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission's political resolutions on guaranteeing the Japanese people freedom of speech and publication.

　　盟国对日管制委员会苏联委员基斯连科提出建议
　  撤销吉田反动政府封闭联合通讯社的非法命令
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社二十五日讯：东京消息：日本迫害民主报纸的活动正在继续着。目前，已有一千七百三十六种民主报刊被禁止出版。民主报界的许多工作人员被捕，其中有通讯员、编辑部职员、订购代理人和新闻记者。例如，《和平之声》报被查封时，大约有数百人被捕；《劳动者》报被停刊时，有三百多人被捕。
    七月十二日，日本警察搜查了联合通讯社的总编辑部，没收它的财产和出版物，并查封了该社。同时，警察还搜查了该社在日本许多城市中所设的四十六个分社。联合通讯社成立于一九四八年，它是靠日本各工会团体的基金创办起来的。它是每天发给工会和民主团体新闻稿的日本唯一通讯社。
    联合通讯社的领导机构于七月十四日曾向盟国对日委员会各委员提出请愿书，抗议日本政府这种侵犯言论和出版自由的专横行为。并要求对日委员会委员们采取措施，以撤销日本政府解散该社的命令。
    七月二十日，盟国对日委员会应苏联委员基斯连科少将的要求，召开会议。苏联代表在会上宣读联合通讯社的请愿书，并建议撤销日本政府的非法命令，因为它违反波茨坦公告和远东委员会关于保证日本人民有言论和出版自由的各项政治决议。
