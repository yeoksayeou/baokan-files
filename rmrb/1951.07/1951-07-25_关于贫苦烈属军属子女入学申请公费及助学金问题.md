　　Regarding the Issue of Application for Public Funding and Scholarships for Children of Impoverished Revolutionary Martyrs and Military Dependents

    Question: Article 6, item 3 of the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Families of Revolutionary Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on December 11th last year stipulates: "Children of impoverished martyrs and impoverished revolutionary soldiers have priority in enjoying public funding and scholarship treatment." What is the difference between public funding and scholarships referred to in this regulation? How to apply? Can the children of martyrs or revolutionary soldiers who are already enjoying scholarship benefits apply for public funding again if their family is very poor?
              (Asked by Cheng Gongpei, et al.)

    Answer: Public funding and people's scholarships are different in nature. Public funding is set up for the children of revolutionary martyrs and the children of revolutionary soldiers and supply-system cadres who have financial difficulties and meet certain conditions. Some of them have parents who sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause and they do not yet have the ability to live independently; others have parents who have been receiving supply-system treatment in the long revolutionary struggle and are now unable to bear the education expenses of their children, so the government must take care of them. People's scholarships are established for students who have financial difficulties and excellent grades, and are open to general impoverished families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres, and also give appropriate consideration to ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese children.

    The specific methods for implementing public funding and people's scholarships are currently stipulated separately by the major administrative regions and the provinces and cities directly under the Central Government. For example, Beijing has a Publicly Funded Student Review Committee (this committee is located within the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, and is jointly composed of the Bureau of Culture and Education, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, and the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China). Revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers' children who meet the aforementioned conditions and wish to apply for public funding should first apply to the Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs (children of supply-system cadres should apply to the organization where the cadre is located), and after approval by the Municipal Publicly Funded Student Review Committee, report to the school where they are located to receive it.

    All public and private middle schools and universities, except for primary schools, have people's scholarships. The application procedure involves individual application, followed by democratic evaluation by students and review by the Scholarship Review Committee, and then verification by the school and reporting to the higher-level cultural and educational department for approval.

    Children of martyrs and soldiers who are already enjoying scholarship benefits can apply to change to public funding due to poverty in their families, without restrictions.

　　关于贫苦烈属军属子女入学申请公费及助学金问题
    问：去年十二月十一日中央人民政府内务部颁布的“革命烈士家属革命军人家属优待暂行条例”第六条第三项规定：“贫苦烈士、贫苦革命军人的子弟入学有享受公费及助学金待遇之优先权”。这条例所指的公费和助学金，两者有什么区别？怎样申请？已享受助学金待遇的烈士或革命军人子女，因家境很贫苦，可否再申请公费？
              （程公沛等问）
    答：公费和人民助学金性质不同。公费是为革命烈士子女及经济困难且具备一定条件之革命军人和供给制干部的子女而设。他们有的是父母已为革命事业牺牲了生命，自己还没有独立生活的能力；有的是父母在长期革命斗争中一直是按供给制待遇，现在无力担负子女的教育费，政府必须予以照顾。人民助学金是为经济困难，成绩优秀的学生而设立的，一般的贫苦烈、军、干属均可申请，并适当照顾少数民族及华侨子女。
    实施公费及人民助学金的具体办法，现系由各大行政区与中央直属各省市分别规定。如北京市设有公费生审查委员会（该会设在市文教局内，由文教局、民政局、中共北京市委员会组织部共同组成）。合乎前述条件的革命烈士、革命军人子女欲申请公费时，先向市民政局申请（供给制干部子女则向干部所在机关申请），经市公费生审查委员会批准后，在所在学校报领。
    除小学外，各公私立中学、大学均设有人民助学金。申请手续是由个人申请，经同学民主评议、助学金审议委员会审查后，由学校核报上级文教部门批准。
    已经享受助学金待遇的烈属、军属子女，因家境贫困，可以改请公费，不受限制。
