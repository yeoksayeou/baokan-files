    (1) Last winter, the American aggressors frantically tried to burn the flames of their aggression against Korea into our country. Railway worker Song Xiankui clearly remembered the pain of being a subjugated people during the Japanese occupation. With an angry heart, he crossed the Yalu River and went to the Korean battlefield.
    (2) After crossing the river, everywhere he looked, he saw burned-down houses and Korean women and children who had been killed or wounded by American planes. Song Xiankui felt real hatred in his heart! He knew that if the American devils were not driven away, the Chinese and Korean people would never have a good life.
    (3) Song Xiankui was assigned to the Aid Korea Railway Engineering Team, where he served as chairman of a grassroots trade union. The task of the engineering team was to repair bridges and railway lines, ensuring smooth transportation so that trains carrying ammunition and supplies could safely reach the front.

    （一）去年冬天，美国侵略者疯狂地要把侵略朝鲜战争的火焰烧进我国国境。铁路工人宋显魁，清楚地记得日寇侵占时期当亡国奴生活的痛苦，他怀着一颗愤怒的心，跨过鸭绿江，走上了朝鲜战场。
    （二）过江以后，到处看得见烧焦了的房屋，和被美国飞机炸死、炸伤了的朝鲜妇女儿童。宋显魁心里真恨呀！他知道：不赶走美国鬼子，中、朝人民就休想过好日子。
    （三）宋显魁被分配到援朝铁路工程队，在一个基层工会里担任主席。工程队的任务是修桥梁、修线路，保证运输通畅，使装载弹药、给养的列车安全地到达前方。
