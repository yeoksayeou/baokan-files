  "Telling Stories and Singing Songs" Editorial Department
  Self-Criticism Regarding the Publication of the "Wu Xun Question" Introduction
    Editor's Note: Yesterday, this newspaper published reader Xiao Wei's criticism of the article "Introduction to the 'Wu Xun Question'" in the 18th issue of "Telling Stories and Singing Songs." Regarding this article, the "Telling Stories and Singing Songs" editorial department has already made a self-criticism in the 19th issue of the publication, which is now reprinted as follows: In our previous issue, we published a short article introducing the "Wu Xun" question. Upon review, the short article made an erroneous introduction, and we failed to fulfill our responsibility to correct it. We sincerely apologize to our readers. The points of error are outlined below:
    1. Although Wu Qi began by begging for food, he gradually became a landlord and usurer after becoming acquainted with the landlord class, eventually accumulating over 230 mu of land and over 2,800 strings of cash. (Editor's Note: This number is much smaller than the actual number; see the "Wu Xun's Usurious Exploitation" section of the Historical Investigation of Wu Xun.) It is inaccurate to use "begging for food" to describe his identity.
    2. Landlords, officials, and gentry acted as his backers, helping him transform into a landlord and usurer before he established schools. The article's statement that they "helped him" run three lackey elementary schools is too vague, as if landlords, officials, and gentry were helping a beggar establish schools.
    3. According to investigations, the students in his three "free schools" were entirely children of the landlord class, with not a single poor child among them (Editor's Note: There were children of poor peasants in Wu Xun's schools, but they were very few in number; see the "Nature of Wu Xun's Schools" section of the Historical Investigation of Wu Xun). The article's claim that he did it for poor children is also incorrect.
    4. The article stated, "...some people regard him as a national hero...to promote him, therefore, some people wrote many critical articles published in the newspapers to let everyone know the 'true image' of this 'Wu Xun'," blurring the lines between right and wrong in principle, failing to draw a clear line between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary ideologies, thus losing its correct stance. It seems to say that those who promoted him and those who exposed his "true image" were merely engaged in a lawsuit in the newspapers, with which it had nothing to do. It failed to point out that the promoters held reactionary bourgeois ideas and that the critics were wielding the weapon of Marxism-Leninism to fight against this reactionary ideology, thus failing to make people feel that reactionary ideology should be overthrown.

### “说说唱唱”编辑室　对发表“武训问题”介绍一文的检讨

  　“说说唱唱”编辑室
  　对发表“武训问题”介绍一文的检讨
    编者按：昨天，本报发表了读者萧蔚对“说说唱唱”第十八期《〈武训问题〉介绍》一文的批评。关于这篇文章，“说说唱唱”编辑室已在该刊第十九期上作了检讨，现特转载如下：本刊上期登了一段介绍“武训”问题的短文，事后检查该短文作了错误的介绍，而我们也没有负到纠正的责任，谨向读者道歉。兹将其错误之点指出如下：
    一、武七开始虽说要过饭，可是结识了地主阶级之后就逐渐变成了地主兼高利贷者，最后弄到有土地二百三十余亩，钱二千八百多吊，（编者按：这个数字要比实际数字小得多；参看武训历史调查记“武训的高利贷剥削”部分。）不能以“要饭”来说明他的身份。
    二、地主、官、绅作了他的后台老板，帮着他变作地主和高利贷之后他才兴学，该文说“帮着他”办了三座奴才小学太含糊，好像还是地主、官、绅们帮着一个叫花子兴学来的。
    三、据调查他的三座“义学”的学生完全是地主阶级的子弟，连一个穷孩子也不曾有过（编者按：武训学校里是有穷苦农民的子弟的，但为数极少；参看武训历史调查记“武训学校的性质”部分），该文说他为穷孩子也是错误的。
    四、该文说“……有些人把他当成民族英雄……来宣传他，因此才又有些人写了许多批评文章登在报上叫咱们大家认识这个‘武训’的本像”，模糊了原则是非，没有划清革命和反革命思想界限，因而失掉了正确的立场，好像说宣传他的人和揭露他“本像”的人只是原被双方在报上打官司，与自己无关，不曾指出宣传者是有反动的资产阶级思想的，批评者是拿着马列主义的武器来和这种反动思想作战的，因此就不能叫人感觉到反动思想是应该打倒的。
