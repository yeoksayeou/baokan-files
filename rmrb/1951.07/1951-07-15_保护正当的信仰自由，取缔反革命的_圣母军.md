Protect legitimate freedom of religious belief, and ban the counter-revolutionary "Legion of Mary"
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has announced the banning of the secret reactionary terrorist organization "Legion of Mary" within the Catholic Church. This is not only absolutely necessary for protecting social order, but it is also absolutely necessary to protect pure, law-abiding Catholics from being deceived and coerced by reactionary bandits into taking the path of reaction. All Catholics must draw a significant lesson from the Tianjin "Legion of Mary" case.

    The conspiracy to assassinate uncovered in Tianjin by the "Legion of Mary" proves that the "Legion of Mary" is not a simple "religious organization" at all, but a counter-revolutionary terrorist organization like the Yiguandao.

    Those within the Catholic Church who oppose independence and renovation often argue that they do not concern themselves with politics, do not oppose any government, and will not betray their motherland. The actual behavior of the Tianjin "Legion of Mary" proves the exact opposite. The "Legion of Mary's" activities are focused on politics. The "Legion of Mary" curses the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, which are praised by the people of the whole country, and the "Legion of Mary" praises the Japanese invaders, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the American aggressors, who are cursed by the people of the whole country. The entire purpose of the "Legion of Mary" is to be enemies with the people of the whole country, to be enemies with the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, to be enemies with the Communist Party, and to overthrow the people's democratic power of the new China. The "Legion of Mary" calls the people's regime "sinful rule," and they openly declare that they want to destroy the "sinful rule, overthrow its foundation, and erect the banner of the Christian Kingdom in its broken monuments." (Legion of Mary Manual) But what is their so-called "banner of the Kingdom of God"? It turns out to be the banner of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the "Legion of Mary" pays special attention to absorbing Kuomintang secret agents, fugitive landlords, bullies, bandits, and hooligans as members. The backbone of the "Legion of Mary" in many places are all agents of Chiang Kai-shek's secret service organizations, the Central Unification Bureau (CC Clique) and the Military Statistics Bureau, or spies of imperialist countries. The main activities of the "Legion of Mary" are to collect intelligence, spread counter-revolutionary rumors, and undermine the implementation of various policies of the People's Government. Even the "Legion of Mary" itself admits: "The purpose of the Legion of Mary is completely opposed to that of the devil, but their methods are somewhat similar. ... Each side... creates a majority of cadres, obeys its strict discipline, and fights to the death. ... Each side uses struggle as a tool to achieve its highest goal." (Legion of Mary Manual) May I ask: What kind of religious group is this? If deceived Catholics do not wake up quickly, and continue to regard the People's Government and the Communist Party as "devils" and the rule of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek as the "Kingdom of God," then how can they escape the crime of betraying the motherland and hating the people? Then, what future is there for Catholicism and Catholics in China?

    The People's Government protects legitimate freedom of religious belief. Since liberation, the People's Government has not oppressed legitimate religious activities in urban and rural areas across the country. However, imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary secret agent elements in the Catholic Church deliberately spread remarks among believers that are hostile to the People's Government, engage in actions that undermine the People's Government, and even use methods of threats and deception to organize secret reactionary groups such as the "Legion of Mary" and plot to carry out assassinations. Of course, the People's Government must strictly ban and thoroughly destroy such reactionary groups. Even so, the People's Government still adopts a policy of protection for all legitimate religious activities of Catholics who do not participate in illegal organizations, do not carry out reactionary propaganda and reactionary acts. Therefore, as long as Catholics are not manipulated by imperialist elements and reactionary elements, they will still have the position they deserve in our great motherland.

    Moreover, the People's Government's policy towards counter-revolutionary organizations such as the "Legion of Mary" is still a combination of suppression and leniency. Those ringleaders who use the "Legion of Mary" organization to engage in betraying the motherland and undermining the people's democratic cause must be suppressed and punished in accordance with "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counterrevolutionaries." However, if they voluntarily surrender to the People's Government sincerely repent, the People's Government will still deal with them leniently. The backbone elements who preside over daily reactionary activities, that is, the general branch "staff" and above, must immediately register with the local People's Public Security organs, hand over the list and documents of the reactionary organization, confess all reactionary activities, and guarantee that they will no longer engage in any activities that undermine the interests of the people in the future, then the People's Government will give lenient treatment. If they resist the laws and decrees of the People's Government, stubbornly be enemies with the people, and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, the People's Government will also severely punish them. As for the general members of the "Legion of Mary," because they do not recognize the counter-revolutionary face of the "Legion of Mary" and are deceived or forced to join, as long as they declare to the People's Public Security organs that they are withdrawing from this reactionary organization and stop their activities, the government will not pursue the matter.

    We hope that all patriotic, religious-loving, and self-respecting Catholics inside and outside the "Legion of Mary" will quickly wake up, stand with the people of the whole country, launch an accusation movement against the "Legion of Mary" and the imperialist and counter-revolutionary elements within the Catholic Church, expose the criminal activities of the "Legion of Mary," and report the imperialist and counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the Catholic Church. Only in this way will they have a bright future.

### 保护正当的信仰自由，取缔反革命的“圣母军”

　　保护正当的信仰自由，取缔反革命的“圣母军”
    天津市人民政府已经宣布取缔天主教内的秘密反动恐怖组织“圣母军”。这不但对于保护社会治安是完全必要的，就是为了保护纯洁守法的天主教徒不受反动匪类所欺骗胁迫而走上反动道路，也是完全必要的。一切天主教徒，必须从天津“圣母军”案件中得到重大的教训。
    天津所破获的“圣母军”阴谋暗杀案，证明“圣母军”完全不是什么单纯的“宗教组织”，而是与一贯道一样的反革命恐怖组织。
    天主教内反对自立革新的人们常常辩护说他们是不问政治的，是不反对任何政府的，是不会背叛祖国的。天津“圣母军”的实际行为证明完全相反，“圣母军”的活动，集中于政治。“圣母军”所诅咒的是全国人民歌颂的人民政府和人民解放军，“圣母军”所歌颂的是全国人民诅咒的日寇、蒋介石匪帮和美国侵略者。“圣母军”的全部目的，就是与全国人民为敌，与人民政府和人民解放军为敌，与共产党为敌，就是推翻新中国的人民民主政权。“圣母军”把人民政权叫做“罪恶的统治”，他们公然宣布他们要毁灭“罪恶的统治，推翻它的基础，在它的残碑断碣里树立起基督神国的旗帜。”（圣母军手册）但是什么是他们所谓“神国的旗帜”呢？原来就是帝国主义和蒋介石的旗帜。因此“圣母军”特别注意吸收国民党特务、逃亡地主、恶霸、土匪以及流氓分子为团员，许多地方的“圣母军”的骨干分子，都是蒋介石特务机关中统、军统的特务或帝国主义国家的间谍。“圣母军”的主要活动，是收集情报，散播反革命谣言，破坏人民政府各项政策的实施。甚至“圣母军”自己也承认：“圣母军与魔鬼的目的，是完全对立的，然而他们的方法，却有点类似。……每一方都……造成多数的干部，服从它严密的纪律，作殊死的斗争。……每一方都利用斗争，作为达到最高目标的工具。”
    （圣母军手册）试问：这是什么宗教团体呢？如果受欺骗的天主教徒还不赶快觉悟，还继续把人民政府和共产党看作“魔鬼”，而把美帝国主义和蒋介石的统治看作“神国”，那么，他们怎能逃脱背叛祖国、仇视人民的罪名呢？那么，天主教和天主教徒，在中国还有什么出路呢？
    人民政府是保护正当的信仰自由的。全国城乡自解放至今，人民政府并没有压迫过正当的宗教事业。但是天主教中的帝国主义分子和反革命特务分子，却偏偏在教徒中散布仇视人民政府的言论，进行破坏人民政府的行动，甚至利用威胁和欺骗的方法，组织“圣母军”一类秘密反动团体，阴谋实行暗杀。人民政府对于这样的反动团体，当然不能不加以严厉的取缔，彻底的摧毁。虽然如此，人民政府对于一切不参加非法组织，不进行反动宣传和反动行为的天主教徒的一切正当的宗教活动，仍然采取保护的政策。所以，天主教徒只要不受帝国主义分子和反动分子的操纵，在我们伟大的祖国，就仍然有他们应得的地位。
    不但如此，人民政府对待“圣母军”这一类反革命组织的政策，也仍然是镇压与宽大相结合的政策。凡是利用“圣母军”组织，从事背叛祖国、破坏人民民主事业的首恶分子，都必须予以镇压，并按照“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”予以惩治。但如他们自动向人民政府真诚自首悔过，人民政府仍当从轻处理。其主持日常反动活动的骨干分子，即一般的支会“职员”以上的分子，必须立即向当地人民公安机关进行登记，交出反动组织的名单和证件，坦白一切反动活动，并保证今后不再进行任何破坏人民利益的活动，那么人民政府就给以宽大处理。如果他们抵抗人民政府法令，死心塌地地与人民为敌，继续进行反革命活动，人民政府也要从严惩办。“圣母军”的一般团员，因为不认识“圣母军”的反革命面目而被骗或被迫加入的，只要向人民公安机关声明退出这一反动组织，停止活动，政府就不予追究。
    我们希望“圣母军”内外的一切爱国爱教和自爱的天主教徒，快快觉悟起来，和全国人民站在一起，展开对“圣母军”和天主教内帝国主义分子反革命分子的控诉运动，揭发“圣母军”的罪恶活动，检举隐藏在天主教中的帝国主义分子反革命分子。只有这样，才是他们的光明大道。
