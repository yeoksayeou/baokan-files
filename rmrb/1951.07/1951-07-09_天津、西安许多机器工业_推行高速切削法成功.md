　　In Tianjin and Xi'an, many machine industries have successfully promoted high-speed cutting methods.

    A widespread movement to apply high-speed cutting methods has taken shape in the machine industry sector of Tianjin. To date, sixteen units in the city have practically applied this advanced production technology. Among them, Tianjin Machine Factory has applied high-speed cutting methods to two-fifths of its machine tools, and one-third of its machine tools have reached or exceeded the high-speed cutting speed standard of 150 meters per minute. Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory has also applied high-speed cutting methods to one-quarter of its machine tools. Even belt-driven lathes, which generally cannot perform high-speed cutting, have improved efficiency by applying the principles of high-speed cutting and improving tools and operating methods. After improvements, the belt-driven lathes of the West Factory of Electrical Equipment Factory have generally increased efficiency by five or six times. As for lathes that perform high-speed cutting, not only has production efficiency been greatly improved compared to the original, but the product quality is also better than before. For example, Li Wenqing of Tianjin Machine Factory used a boring machine to bore cylinder holes, which not only increased efficiency tenfold, but also reduced the roundness error of the cylinder holes from 0.03 mm to 0.01 mm, and the surface was also very smooth.

    One of the main reasons for the great success of the promotion of high-speed cutting methods in Tianjin's machine industry this time is that this work was carried out in a very planned and step-by-step manner. Most units have established high-speed cutting method promotion committees, including excellent engineers and technical workers, to be responsible for the promotion of high-speed cutting methods, and to specifically study issues such as tool angles and speed increases. Before the experiment, the promotion committee carefully checked the equipment and effective horsepower of the machine tools to determine the improvement work of the machine tools. Factories with a large number of machine tools adopted the method of typical experiments and comprehensive promotion. For example, Tianjin Machine Factory divided the lathes into five categories, selected one lathe from each category for typical experiments, and then held a performance to promote it after success. Another main reason is the workers' hard work and technical personnel's specific help to the workers. For example, Xing Deyu, a worker at Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory, solved problems such as grinding methods and tool angles with the help of engineer Jin Kui and his own efforts. Si Zhenyou, a technician at the West Factory of Electrical Equipment Factory, and Qi Daren, a lathe operator, jointly researched and experimented, replaced the dead center with a live center, gradually corrected the tool angle, and increased the speed, so that the efficiency increased to more than fourteen times.

    So far, the production efficiency of the Tianjin Machine Factory and Tianjin Automobile Parts Factory, which widely promote high-speed cutting methods, has increased by two times. However, if workshops other than the cutting workshop (such as the foundry, etc.) cannot improve production efficiency in the same way as the cutting workshop, it will limit the improvement of the entire factory's production efficiency. Therefore, Tianjin Machine Factory and others are adjusting production organization and improving material supply to adapt to the new production situation. At the same time, due to the great increase in production efficiency, the original various quotas are no longer applicable, so the factory is re-formulating various quotas and production financial plans.

    Xinhua News Agency: The Xi'an Xijing Automobile Repair Factory has achieved initial success in learning high-speed cutting methods. On a Japanese-style belt-pulley eight-foot lathe, the factory used carbide tools to turn Dodge brand automobile rear axles, with an efficiency three times higher than usual, and the efficiency of turning alloy aluminum pistons was doubled.

    When testing the cutting of alloy aluminum pistons, many workers in the factory had concerns. Some said: "Carbide tools can only cut cast iron and hard steel. I am afraid that cutting aluminum pistons will not be flat and smooth!" Some said: "It may work for big things, but not for small things!" However, the director of the manufacturing department, Lü Fuzeng, and the worker, Gao Qingquan, who conducted the experiment, had great confidence. They tried to press the carbide cutter head into four pieces, changed the previous high rake angle to a positive rake angle, and increased the speed from 140 revolutions to 340 revolutions. As a result, the pistons turned out to be flat and smooth. In the past, this lathe could only turn sixty pistons per day. According to the efficiency of this cutting, it can turn one hundred and twenty pistons per day. Normally, the tool had to be changed after turning thirty pistons, but this time the tool was not changed after turning five hundred pistons, saving a lot of procedures.

    Now the factory is preparing to convert all lathes to high-speed cutting methods, and the cutting methods are also being gradually improved.

    On June 21, fifteen machine industries in Xi'an organized more than eighty worker representatives to visit the factory for a performance. The workers who had visited the performance were very interested in doing the same experiment.

### 天津、西安许多机器工业  推行高速切削法成功

　　天津、西安许多机器工业
    推行高速切削法成功
    应用高速切削法在天津市机器工业部门中，已形成广泛的运动。到目前为止，全市已有十六个单位实际应用了这一先进的生产技术。其中天津机器厂已有五分之二的机床应用了高速切削法，并有三分之一的机床已达到或超过每分钟一百五十公尺的高速切削的速度标准。天津汽车制配厂也有四分之一的机床应用了高速切削法。一般不能进行高速切削的皮带轮传动车床，也因运用高速切削法原理，改进了刀具和操作法而提高了效能。电工器材厂西厂的皮带轮传动车床经过改进后，一般效率已提高了五、六倍。至于进行高速切削的车床，不仅生产效率比原来大为提高，而且产品质量也比原来的好。如天津机器厂李文清用搪床搪汽缸眼，不仅效率提高十倍，而且汽缸眼的圆度误差也由零点零三公厘减少到零点零一公厘，表面也很光滑。
    这次天津市机器工业推行高速切削法获得很大成绩的主要原因之一是这一工作进行得很有计划和很有步骤。各单位大都成立了包括优秀工程师和技术工人的高速切削法推行委员会，负责高速切削法的推行工作，并具体研究刀具角度和车速增加等问题。推行委员会在试验前，都仔细地检查机床的设备和有效马力，决定机床的改进工作。机床较多的工厂采取了典型试验、全面推广的办法。如天津机器厂把车床分成五类，每类挑一部车床作典型试验，成功后再举行表演会加以推广。另一主要原因是工人努力钻研和技术人员对工人具体帮助。如天津汽车制配厂工人邢德禹，由于工程师金奎的帮助和自己的努力，解决了磨刀方法和刀具角度等问题。电工器材厂西厂技术员司振有和车工齐达仁共同研究试验，把死顶尖换成活顶尖，逐步校正刀具角度，增加车速，使效率提高到十四倍以上。
    到目前为止，广泛推行高速切削法的天津机器厂和天津汽车制配厂全厂的生产效率已提高了两倍。但如切削以外的车间（如翻砂场等），不能和切削车间一样地提高生产效率，就会限制整个工厂生产效率的提高。因此天津机器厂等正在为适应新的生产情况，而调整生产组织和改进材料供应工作。同时，由于生产效率的大大提高，原有各种定额已不适用，因此该厂又在重新制订各种定额和生产财务计划。（新华社）
    西安西京汽车修配厂学习高速切削法已得到初步成功。该厂在日本式皮带塔轮八英尺车床上，用硬质合金刀具车大道奇牌的汽车后地轴，效率比平常提高三倍，车合金铝活塞的效率提高一倍。
    在试验切削合金铝活塞时，该厂许多工人都有顾虑。有的说：“硬质合金刀具，只能切削生铁硬钢，切削铝活塞恐怕不会平板光滑！”有的说：“车大东西行，小东西怕不行！”但作试验的制造部主任吕福增和工人高清泉的信心却很高，他们设法把硬质合金刀头压成四块，把以前的高前角改成正前角，车速由一百四十转提高到三百四十转，结果车出的活塞平板光滑。过去这个车床每天只能车六十个活塞，按照这次切削的效率，每天可车一百二十个活塞。平常车三十个活塞就要换一次刀具，这次车五百个活塞也没换刀具，省却不少手续。
    现在该厂正准备把所有车床都改用高速度切削法，切削的方法也在逐步改进中。
    西安市十五家机器业六月二十一日组织了八十多名工人代表前往该厂参观表演。参观过表演的工人都很有兴趣地作着同样的试验。
