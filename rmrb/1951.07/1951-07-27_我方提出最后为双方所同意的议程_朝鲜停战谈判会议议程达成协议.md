Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th. This reporter learned from the headquarters on the Korean front: The tenth meeting of the Korean Armistice Talks began at 1:00 PM (Korean time) on July 26th and ended at 2:10 PM. During the meeting, an agreement was reached on the meeting agenda, and substantive issues began to be discussed. The eleventh meeting is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on July 27th. The final agenda agreed upon by both parties is as follows:

　　(1) Adoption of the agenda.
　　(2) As a basic condition for the cessation of hostile acts in Korea, to determine the military demarcation line between the two sides in order to establish a demilitarized zone.
　　(3) Specific arrangements for the realization of a ceasefire and armistice in Korea, including the composition, powers, and duties of the supervisory agency for the implementation of the ceasefire and armistice terms.
　　(4) The issue of prisoner arrangements.
　　(5) Matters for recommendation to the relevant governments of both parties.

　　Since the first meeting of the negotiation, General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side, has repeatedly pointed out that this armistice negotiation meeting should discuss the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. However, the United Nations Command delegation has consistently refused to discuss this issue at this meeting. In order to reach an armistice agreement as soon as possible and realize the initial aspirations of peace-loving people around the world, our side proposed the final agenda agreed upon by both parties on July 25th, enabling the negotiation meeting to enter substantive discussions. Both parties agreed to discuss, under the fifth agenda item, recommendations to the relevant governments of both parties to convene a higher-level representative meeting within a certain period after the implementation of the armistice agreement to negotiate the phased withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th. This reporter learned from the headquarters on the Korean front:

　　The full text of General Nam Il's speech at the ninth meeting of the Korean Armistice Talks on July 25th is as follows:

　　Having listened to your opinion this morning (referring to General Joye, the chief representative of the United Nations Command), you believe that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea is not sufficient to guarantee that the Korean War will not break out again, and even believe the opposite. We believe that this statement is unfounded. What kind of war is the Korean War today? It is a war involving many countries, and its danger lies in this. The reason for this situation is primarily because a foreign country interfered in Korea's internal affairs and sent its troops to fight in Korea. The composition of this meeting fully illustrates this situation. On June 25, 1950, on the surface, there were indeed no foreign troops in Korea, but the reason for the events of June 25th and its subsequent development was precisely because a large number of foreign troops came to Korea on June 27th, thereby preventing the peaceful resolution of the Korean internal affairs issue that we have always advocated, and developing the war into a war involving many countries. Only when the foreign troops participating on one side marched straight into the heartland of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and directly threatened the security of the People's Republic of China, did the Chinese people be forced to form their own volunteer forces to help the Korean people resist foreign military intervention. Thus, to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ensure our armistice and truce have a reliable guarantee, it is essential to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea.

　　Since our first meeting, our side has consistently advocated that our meeting should discuss and resolve the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea. Our meeting is a ceasefire and armistice meeting, the purpose of which is to achieve a ceasefire and armistice in Korea through mutual agreement on a fair and reasonable basis. Obviously, we want a ceasefire and armistice, not for either of our parties to gain a breathing space to prepare for another war, but to pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Peace-loving people all over the world hope that both of us can do this, and both of us have expressed our attitude, agreeing that in order for our meeting to successfully complete its task, both of us must have sincere goodwill towards the ceasefire and armistice, and obtain a solid guarantee in our negotiations that no more hostile military actions will occur in Korea after the ceasefire and armistice is realized. Since both of us agree that the ceasefire and armistice we want to achieve is not for either of us to gain a breathing space for continuous war, then what is the necessity for those foreign troops who came to Korea to fight to remain in Korea after the ceasefire and armistice? Since both of us agree that we want to obtain a solid guarantee in our negotiations that no more hostile military actions will occur in Korea after the ceasefire and armistice is realized, then what can guarantee that no more hostile military actions will occur in Korea after the ceasefire and armistice better than withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea? No matter from which point of view, the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea is inseparable from the issue of obtaining a ceasefire and armistice in Korea.

　　Based on these self-evident principles, in the past eight meetings, we have repeatedly explained our position without fear of being tedious, and repeatedly proposed the topic of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea. Your side's reasons for refusing to include this issue on the agenda are untenable. However, after eight meetings of consultation, our position has not been agreed to by your side, and we cannot but feel very regretful.

　　Now, in order to reach an armistice agreement as soon as possible to realize the initial aspirations of peace-loving people around the world, we agree to your side's proposal to leave the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea to be resolved at another meeting after the ceasefire and armistice is achieved, and not to include it on the agenda of this meeting. However, given the profound relationship between the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and the ceasefire and armistice we want to achieve, and the fact that the soldiers of the participating foreign countries are so eager to return home and live a peaceful life after the armistice, we believe that our meeting should still make a clear explanation on this important issue after discussing and resolving the issues of ceasefire and armistice. Therefore, we propose to add a fifth item, "Matters for Recommendation to the Relevant Governments of Both Parties," in addition to the four agreed agenda items, so that after both parties have discussed the first four agenda items and reached a specific agreement, under this agenda item, we can discuss recommending to the relevant governments of both parties: convening a higher-level representative meeting within a certain period after the implementation of the armistice agreement to negotiate the phased withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. We believe that such a topic and the content of our suggestions when carrying out this agenda will not only help to achieve an armistice agreement as soon as possible, but also provide further hope for the guarantee of peace in Korea, and we believe that your representatives will agree with this.

　　我方提出最后为双方所同意的议程
　  朝鲜停战谈判会议议程达成协议
    同意讨论向双方有关各国政府建议，在停战协定实施后一定期限内，协商从朝鲜分期撤退一切外国军队的问题。
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判会议第十次会议在七月二十六日下午一时（朝鲜时间）开始，二时十分结束，会议中对于会议议程达成协议，并开始进入了实质问题的讨论。第十一次会议定于七月二十七日上午九时举行，双方最后同意的议程如下：
    （一）通过议程。
    （二）作为在朝鲜停止敌对行为的基本条件，确定双方军事分界线，以建立非军事地区。
    （三）在朝鲜境内实现停火与休战的具体安排，包括监督停火休战条款实施机构的组成、权力与职司。
    （四）关于俘虏的安排问题。
    （五）向双方有关各国政府建议事项。
    自从谈判会议第一次会议起，我方首席代表南日将军就一再指出这次的停战谈判会议应该讨论一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题。但是联合国军代表团始终拒绝在这次会议中讨论这一问题。为了早日达成停战协议，以实现全世界爱好和平人民的初步愿望，我方在七月二十五日提出了最后为双方所同意的议程，使得谈判会议得以进入实质问题的讨论。双方同意在第五项议程下讨论向双方各国有关政府建议，在停战协定实施后一定期限内，召开双方高一级的代表会议，协商从朝鲜分期撤退一切外国军队的问题。
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】本社记者自朝鲜前线总部获悉：
    南日将军在七月二十五日朝鲜停战谈判第九次会议上的发言全文如下：
    今天上午听了你（指联合国军首席代表乔埃将军）的意见，你认为从朝鲜撤退外国军队并不足以保证朝鲜战争不再爆发，甚至认为是相反的。我们认为这种说法是没有根据的。今天的朝鲜战争，是一个什么战争呢？它是一个牵涉许多国家的战争，其危险性也就在此，而这种情况之所以产生，首先是因为一个外国干涉了朝鲜的内政，派出它的军队来朝鲜作战而引起的。我们这个会议的组成，就充分说明了这个情况。一九五○年六月二十五日，从表面上看朝鲜诚然没有外国军队，但六月二十五日的事件的所以发生，及其以后的发展，确是因为六月二十七日就有大量的外国军队来到朝鲜，从而阻止了我们一直主张的朝鲜内政问题的和平解决，并将战争发展为牵涉到好多国家的一种战争。只有参加一方面的外国军队长驱直入至朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的腹地，并直接威胁中华人民共和国的安全时，中国人民才被迫组成自己的志愿部队，帮助朝鲜人民反对外国军队的干涉。这样看来，要和平解决朝鲜问题，并使得我们的停战与休战有可靠的保障，就非从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队不可。
    从我们的第一次会议起，我方就一直主张我们这个会议，应该讨论和解决从朝鲜境内撤退一切外国军队问题。我们这个会议，是个停火休战会议，其目的在于经过双方的协议，在公平合理的基础上，实现朝鲜境内的停火与休战。很显然，我们要停火休战，不是为我们双方的任何一方取得喘息时间准备再战，而是为和平解决朝鲜问题铺平道路。全世界爱好和平的人民希望我们双方都能这样做，而我们双方也都表明过自己的态度，同意要使我们的会议顺利完成任务，就必须我们双方都具有对停火与休战的真诚善意，并在我们的谈判中，获致在朝鲜实现停火休战后不再发生敌对军事行动的坚固保证。既然我们双方同意我们所要达成的停火与休战，不是为我们任何一方取得不断再战的喘息时间，那么那些来到朝鲜作战的外国军队，还有什么必要在停火休战之后，仍然留在朝鲜呢？既然我们双方同意我们要在谈判中获致在朝鲜实现停火与休战后不再发生敌对军事行动的坚固保证，那么还有什么比从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队更能保证朝鲜在停火休战后不再发生敌对的军事行动呢？不论从那一个观点看，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的问题，是和在朝鲜获得停火与休战的问题分不开的。
    根据这些不辩自明的道理，在过去的八次会议中，我们曾不惮烦地反复说明了我们的主张，并一再提出从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队这项议题。你方拒绝将这一问题列入议程的理由，是站不住的。可是经过八次会议的协商，我们的主张竟得不到你方的同意，我们不能不认为十分遗憾。
    现在我方为求得早日达成停战协议，以实现全世界爱好和平人民的初步愿望，我们同意你方将从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题留待停火休战实现后，在另一个会议去解决的主张，而不将其列入此次会议的议程之内。但鉴于从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题和我们所要达成的停火与休战有如此深刻的关系，而参战各外国的士兵又如此愿望在停战之后回家过和平的生活，我们认为：我们此次会议在讨论和解决了停火休战诸问题之后，仍然应对这个重要问题作一个明确交代。因此，我们提议在已协议的四项议程之外，加上第五项“向双方有关各国政府建议事项”，以便我们双方在讨论了前四项议程，并达成具体协议后，在此项议程下，讨论向双方有关各国政府建议：在停战协定实施后一定期限内，召开双方高一级的代表会议，协商从朝鲜分期撤退一切外国军队的问题。我们认为：这样的议题及我们准备在进行这项议程时的建议的内容，对于早日达成停战协议的愿望，既有帮助，而对于朝鲜和平的保证，又有了进一步的希望，想你方代表对此当能予以同意。
