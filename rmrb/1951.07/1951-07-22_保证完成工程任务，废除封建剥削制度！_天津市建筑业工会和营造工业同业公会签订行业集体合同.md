　　The Tianjin Construction Workers' Union Working Committee and the Tianjin Construction Industry Trade Association have signed an industry collective contract. The contract is divided into seven chapters and twenty-eight articles, which make specific provisions for both parties to jointly guarantee the completion of engineering tasks, abolish the feudal exploitation system, implement democratic management, and resolve issues such as labor protection, labor insurance, and employee benefits.

　　Before liberation, there was a system of "subcontracting" with multiple layers of exploitation in the Tianjin construction industry. The more layers of subcontracting, the heavier the intermediate exploitation, and the lower the wages of the workers. After liberation, workers urgently demanded the abolition of this "subcontracting" system. Therefore, the contract stipulates that after state-owned construction companies or private construction firms contract for projects, they must directly manage and construct them, and shall not subcontract them. If there are parts of the project that they are unable to undertake, they can subcontract them to others, but there must be no intermediate exploitation. Before the construction of each project, state-owned construction companies shall form an on-site management committee composed of the administrative负责人 in charge of the construction site, owner supervisors, representatives of workers of all trades, and union representatives to resolve all relevant issues in the construction process under the principle of not violating the contract and ensuring the timely completion of the project. Private construction firms shall establish a labor-management consultation meeting with the consent of both labor and management to negotiate and resolve labor-management relations issues during the project.

　　In terms of wages, the contract stipulates that the wages of seasonal workers should be higher than the wages of long-term workers, but the higher part should not exceed 20% to 30% of the wages of long-term workers, according to the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more pay." The wages of non-technical workers should be 30% to 50% of the wages of technical workers, and the wages of foremen should be assessed based on their technical ability. After state-owned construction companies and private construction firms contract for projects and sign contracts with owners, they should announce the number of workers and the unit price of wages to the workers. In terms of working hours, the contract stipulates the implementation of a ten-hour working day. If it is necessary to extend working hours due to special circumstances, the consent of the workers should be obtained in advance, but it should not exceed twelve hours at most. At the same time, the contractors should give the workers certain overtime pay. In terms of labor protection, labor insurance, and employee benefits, the contract stipulates that safety equipment must be prepared before construction, and special personnel should be sent to educate workers on relevant operating techniques and risk prevention to prevent accidents. The administrative side of state-owned construction companies or the capital side of private construction firms should arrange suitable accommodation for workers on the construction site, pay attention to hygiene in summer, keep them warm in winter, and ensure that they are not collapsing, leaking, or damp as the minimum standard. Regarding the treatment of employee deaths, disabilities, and illnesses, the contract stipulates that the benefits enjoyed by non-members shall not exceed half of those enjoyed by union members. Regarding employment and dismissal issues, the contract stipulates that union members should be given priority in employment under the same technical conditions. When the administrative side of state-owned construction companies or the capital side of private construction firms dismiss workers during the project without violating government laws and regulations or collective contracts, they must notify the union or worker representatives in advance.

　　保证完成工程任务，废除封建剥削制度！
　  ——天津市建筑业工会和营造工业同业公会签订行业集体合同
    天津市建筑业工会工作委员会与天津市营造工业同业公会签订了行业集体合同。合同共分七章二十八条，对双方共同保证完成工程任务，废除封建剥削制度，实行民主管理及解决劳动保护、劳动保险和职工福利等问题，均作了具体规定。
    解放前，天津建筑业中有层层剥削的“转包”制度，转包层次越多，中间剥削越重，工人的工资就越低。解放以后，工人就迫切要求废除这种“转包”制度。因此，合同中规定国营建筑公司或私营营造厂商承包工程后，均必须直接管理、施工，不得转包。如带有无力承做的部分工程，可以向外分包，但不得有中间剥削行为。国营建筑公司在每一工程施工前，应由工地行政负责人及业主监工人员、各工别工人代表、工会代表等组成现场管理委员会，在不违背合同、保证如期完成工程任务的原则下，解决施工中的一切有关问题。私营营造厂商，由劳资双方同意，成立劳资协商会议，协商解决工程进行中的劳资关系问题。
    在工资方面，合同根据按劳取酬、多劳多得的原则，规定季节工的工资应高于长工的工资，但所高部分不能超过长工工资的百分之二十至三十。非技术工人的工资应为技术工人工资的百分之三十至五十，领工人员工资根据技术能力评定。国营建筑公司和私营营造厂商承包工程与业主订立合同后，应将承包工程的工数及工资单价一并向工人公布。在工作时间方面，合同规定实行十小时工作制，如遇特殊情况必须延长工作时间时，应事先征得工人同意，但最多不得超过十二小时，同时承包工程者应给予工人一定的加班加点费。在劳动保护、劳动保险和职工福利方面，合同规定在施工前须作好安全设备，并派专人对工人进行有关操作技术和防险的教育，以预防发生事故。国营建筑公司的行政方面或私营营造厂商的资方应在工地为工人安置适当住所，夏季注意卫生，冬季保持温暖，并以不塌不漏及不潮湿为最低标准。关于职工死亡、残废、疾病的待遇，合同规定非会员的享受不得超过工会会员的半数。关于雇用、解雇问题，合同规定在同等技术条件下，得尽先雇用工会会员。当工程进行中国营建筑公司的行政方面或私营营造厂商资方在不违背政府法令或集体合同的原则下解雇工人时，须预先通知工会或工人代表。
