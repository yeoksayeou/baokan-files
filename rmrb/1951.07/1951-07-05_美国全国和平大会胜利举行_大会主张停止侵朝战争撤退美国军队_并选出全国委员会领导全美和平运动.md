Xinhua News Agency, Chicago, 3rd. According to TASS, the American National Peace Conference was held in Chicago from June 29th to July 1st. Nearly 5,000 delegates attended the conference from all corners of the 48 states, including nearly 2,000 union representatives and about 600 representatives of farmers and agricultural workers, as well as scientists, writers, artists, students, church workers, and other people from all walks of life.

The conference was opened by Richardsson, a leader of the "American Peace Crusaders" and a well-known American trade union activist. Amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience, he said: "We are here to express our firm will to demand peace. We want peace, and we will strive to obtain it." He mentioned the path to a peaceful solution to the Korean issue recently pointed out by Soviet Representative to the United Nations Malik, and said: "We support this proposal and demand the start of negotiations to end the Korean War. We will fight for peace and democracy and against the fascistization of our country."

Du Bois, the famous black American historian who was persecuted by the American judicial authorities for engaging in peace-keeping activities, exposed to the conference the fact that American monopoly capital dominates American foreign and domestic policies, pointing out that this oligarchy, while implementing war plans, is fostering militarism at home, trampling on civil rights and democracy, and expanding propaganda to deceive the American people.

Reverend Uphas, a member of the World Peace Council, said that the American people demand an immediate cessation of military operations in Korea and the withdrawal of American troops in Korea. He expressed his firm belief that this National Peace Conference is the beginning of a great movement for peace in the United States.

Professor Carlson of the University of Chicago called on the attendees to unite and strive for peace.

In his speech, the famous black singer Robeson cited many facts about the increasing strength of the peace movement in various parts of the United States. He said that the American people are protesting against the current policies of the American government and demanding the establishment of friendly relations with socialist countries.

Other speakers included representatives from various trade unions, farmers' associations, and women. They unanimously opposed the war and demanded peace in Korea. These speeches demanding peace aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The conference held group meetings on the morning of the second day. More than 500 representatives participated in the "Living Conditions and Expanding Armaments Movement" group. They discussed the problems of rising prices, increased donations and taxes, and the deterioration of the lives of working people caused by the American arms expansion movement. The "Labor Group" drafted a draft resolution calling on American workers to unite against the warmongers, which called on the American government to immediately stop the Korean War and hold negotiations with the major powers. The "Farmers Group" included hundreds of small farmers' representatives from various states. They pointed out that large monopoly enterprises are destroying the 3.8 million small farmers in the United States, and the war policy is driving them to bankruptcy. The group meeting elected a special committee to draft a program for American farmers to fight for peace. The "Veterans Group" decided to establish a standing committee to guide the peace movement of veterans.

At the plenary meeting on the afternoon of the second day, the speakers unanimously exposed the aggressive plans of the American reactionaries and called on the American people to step up the struggle for peace. In his speech, the famous writer Conn refuted the lies of the American reactionaries that the Soviet Union refused to cooperate with the United States and other countries, pointing out that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated international peace and cooperation, while it is precisely the world's reactionary forces, led by the United States, that are trying to overthrow the Soviet government. He asked everyone to work hard to force the government to engage in peace negotiations with the Soviet Union.

The third day of the conference passed various decisions to expand and strengthen the American peace movement. The conference also unanimously passed the "Declaration of Principles" and the peace program, which reflected the American people's desire for peace, calling for the complete restoration of peace in Korea, immediate major power negotiations to resolve all differences, arms reduction and the abandonment of weapons of mass destruction, and supervision of their implementation. The letter to the workers passed by the conference called on them to form a united front to fight for peace and against the warmongers.

The conference elected a national committee to lead the national peace movement in the United States. Dr. Du Bois, Professor Carlson, and former Virgin Islands Governor Professor Lawitt were elected as chairmen of the National Committee. Many other social celebrities, scientists, artists, pastors, etc. were elected as members.

This conference was convened under the circumstances that the American reactionaries are stepping up their persecution of progressive forces in the United States. The preparations for the conference were disrupted and obstructed by the "American Legion" and the leadership organs of the CIO and AFL instigated by the American reactionaries, but the firm will of the progressive people of the United States to defend peace overcame these difficulties, enabling the conference to open in Chicago as scheduled and complete successfully.

　　美国全国和平大会胜利举行
    大会主张停止侵朝战争撤退美国军队
    并选出全国委员会领导全美和平运动
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社芝加哥消息，美国全国和平大会于六月二十九日至七月一日在芝加哥举行。大会到会代表约近五千人，来自全国四十八州各个角落，包括约近二千名工会代表和约六百名农民和农业工人的代表以及科学家、作家、艺术家、学生、教会工作者等其他各界人士。
    大会由“美国和平十字军”领导人之一、美国著名工会运动活动家李查德生揭幕。他在听众的热烈掌声中说道：“我们来到这里，是为了表示我们要求和平的坚定意志的。我们要和平，而且我们要努力得到它。”他提到苏联驻联合国代表马立克最近指出的和平解决朝鲜问题的途径，并说：“我们支持这个建议，并要求开始关于停止朝鲜战争的谈判。我们要为争取和平与民主、反对我国法西斯化而斗争。”
    因为从事保卫和平活动受到美国司法当局迫害的美国著名黑人历史学家杜波依斯，向大会揭露了美国垄断资本支配美国外交和国内政策的事实，指出：这种寡头统治在实施战争计划同时，正在国内培育军国主义、蹂躏公民权利与民主、扩大蒙蔽美国人民的宣传。
    世界和平理事会理事、牧师乌法斯说：美国人民要求立即停止在朝鲜的军事行动，撤退在朝鲜的美国军队。他表示坚信，这次全国和平大会是在美国展开伟大的争取和平运动的开端。
    芝加哥大学教授卡尔逊号召到会者团结一致争取和平。
    著名黑人歌唱家罗伯逊在演说中举出了许多美国各地和平运动日益加强的事实，他说：美国人民都抗议美国政府的现行政策，而要求与社会主义国家建立友好关系。
    其他发言的有各地工会、农民协会与妇女的代表。他们一致反对战争、要求朝鲜和平。这些要求和平的演说都引起了全场热烈的掌声。
    大会于第二日上午进行分组会议。“生活条件和扩张军备运动”组有五百余代表参加。他们讨论了美国扩军运动使物价上涨、捐税增加、劳动人民生活恶化的问题。“劳工组”起草了号召美国工人们团结起来反对战争贩子的决议草案，其中要求美国政府立即停止朝鲜战争，并与各大国举行谈判。“农民组”包括来自各州的数百名小农代表。他们指出了大垄断企业正在毁灭美国的三百八十万户小农，战争政策使它们走向破产。小组会选出特别委员会起草了美国农民为争取和平而斗争的纲领。“退伍军人组”决定设立常设委员会，以指导退伍军人的和平运动。
    在第二日下午的全体会议上，发言的人一致揭露美国反动派的侵略计划，并号召美国人民加紧争取和平的斗争。著名作家康恩在发言中驳斥了美国反动派说苏联拒绝与美国及其他国家合作的谎言，指出苏联一贯主张国际和平合作，而恰恰是以美国为首的世界反动势力力图推翻苏联政府。他要求大家努力迫使政府与苏联从事和平谈判。
    大会第三日会议通过了各项扩大和加强美国和平运动的决定。大会还一致过通了反映美国人民争取和平的意愿的“原则宣言”和和平纲领，要求完全恢复朝鲜和平、立即举行大国谈判以解决一切分歧、裁减军备和废弃大规模毁灭的武器并监督其执行。大会通过的告工人书要求他们组成争取和平反对战争贩子的统一战线。
    大会选出了全国委员会来领导美国全国的和平运动。杜波依斯博士、卡尔逊教授、前维尔京群岛总督劳维特教授当选为全国委员会主席。其他社会名流、科学家、艺术家、牧师等多人当选为委员。
    这次大会是在美国反动派加紧迫害美国进步力量的情形下召开的。大会筹备工作曾遭到美国反动派所唆使的“美国退伍军人团”和产联与劳联的领导机关的破坏与阻挠，但美国进步人民保卫和平的坚决意志克服了这些困难，使大会得以如期在芝加哥开幕并胜利完成。
