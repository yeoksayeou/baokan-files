　　Hebei Establishes New Commercial Network
　　Laying the Foundation for Urban-Rural Material Exchange
    Through the joint efforts of the People's Government, state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and the vast number of private industrialists and merchants, a new commercial network in Hebei Province has been basically established, laying a good foundation for the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
    Currently, the province has 441 branch offices and business groups of state-owned native produce, grain, general merchandise, salt, and coal trading organizations distributed in various cities and towns, and 8,031 rural grassroots cooperatives, as well as provincial, special district, and county-level cooperatives. According to statistics from Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, and nine county towns including Handan and Linqing, there are 535 private freight yards with 3,300 employees. In addition, the province has rectified 2,300 primary rural markets and established 1,600 market management committees in various small towns, with 128,000 market management committee cadres and traders. Old temple fairs have been restored and exchanges have been developed in major towns. Hebei Province Transportation Company has also widely established transportation stations and bus stations at river wharves and transportation hubs, organizing more than 10,000 carts and a large number of wooden boats, handcarts, pack animals, etc., using all possible means of transportation to participate in transportation.
    Through this commercial network, 88.87 percent of the 102 kinds of local products, which accounted for 19.62 percent of the total agricultural income of the province last year, have been sold. With the large-scale sales of rural native products, large quantities of industrial products from other places are continuously flowing into rural areas. According to the sales statistics of the state-owned trading company in the province alone, more than 500,000 bolts of fine cloth, more than 1.6 million catties of white sugar, 480,000 tons of coal, 38,000 dan of salt, and more than 300 million catties of bean cake, as well as other large quantities of general merchandise, were supplied to farmers this spring.

　　河北建立新的商业网
　  为城乡物资交流打下基础
    河北省新的商业网，经过人民政府及国营企业、合作社与广大私营工商业者的共同努力，已经基本上建立起来，为城乡物资交流奠定了良好的基础。
    目前全省有分布在各城镇的国营土产、粮食、百货、食盐、煤炭等贸易机构的分、支机构和业务小组四百四十一个单位，有八千零三十一个农村基层合作社和省、专区、县三级合作社。私营货栈业，据唐山、石家庄、保定、秦皇岛四市及邯郸、临清等九县镇的统计，已有五百三十五户，营业人员达三千三百人。此外，全省整顿了农村初级市场二千三百个；各小城镇建立了集市管理委员会一千六百个；集市管理委员会的干部和交易员有十二万八千人。各重要城镇并恢复了旧庙会和发展了交易所。河北省运输公司在河路码头和交通要道上又普遍建立了运输栈、汽车站，组织了大车万余辆及大批木船、手推车、驮子等，利用一切可能利用的交通工具参加运输。
    经过这一商业网，去年全省占农业总收入百分之十九点六二的一百零二种土产品，已销出百分之八十八点八七。随着农村土产品的大量推销，外地大批工业品源源流向农村。仅据该省国营贸易公司机构的销货统计，今年春季就供给了农民细布五十多万匹，白糖一百六十多万斤，煤炭四十八万吨，食盐三万八千担，豆饼三亿多斤，还有其他大批百货。
