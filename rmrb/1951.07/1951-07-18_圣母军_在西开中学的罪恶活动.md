　　The Heinous Activities of the "Legion of Mary" at Xikai Middle School

　　In the summer of 1948, the imperialist element, Dutch priest Man Jishi, and the secret agent Wang Jiwu (both have been arrested by us), acting on the intention of Wen Guibin to anesthetize and enslave the Chinese people, infiltrated Xikai Middle School one after another, organized the counter-revolutionary organization "Legion of Mary" (also known as "Legion of Mary of the Holy Guard," "Legion of Mary of Charity and Prayer"), plotted to poison our youth, develop the organization, and turn Xikai Middle School into a reactionary fortress in Tianjin, opposing the Chinese people's revolution.

　　Threats, Enticements, Deception, Illegal Development of the Organization

　　After Wang Jiwu and Man Jishi arrived at the school, Wang served as the principal, and Man served as the director of general affairs. Taking advantage of their positions, they actively developed the reactionary organization, first establishing the "Holy Rosary Queen" branch of the "Legion of Mary," and then developing three branches: "Apostles Queen," "Immaculate Queen," and "Gate of Heaven." They used various means of threats, enticements, and deceptions to absorb public teachers and students into the school, and finally developed from a few people to dozens.

　　Their means of anesthetizing, deceiving, and poisoning young people in the name of religion and for the purpose of reactionary activities were extremely insidious and unscrupulous. When recruiting members, they not only absorbed Catholic students from middle school but also absorbed students from Xikai Elementary School. The youngest "members" of the Xikai branches were only eleven or twelve years old. They gave the students small favors, such as buying them things to eat, giving them some old clothes, or paying their tuition fees, to lure and win over Catholic students. Many public teachers and students at Xikai Middle School were deceived by them, and intentionally or unintentionally, became pawns of imperialist elements, engaging in many reactionary and harmful acts against the people.

　　Rumors, Slander, Sabotage, Spreading Reactionary Remarks

　　The "Legion of Mary" held meetings once a week. At the meetings, Wang, Man, and others often spread reactionary remarks. For example, Man Jishi often said to the students: "Now the church is suffering. Don't be afraid. We must be brave." He threatened the students, saying, "The Communist Party is a devil. Don't get close to them. If you get close to them, they will lead you astray." "Stay away from the Youth League members and participate less in large gatherings." They also distributed reactionary pamphlets, such as pamphlets praising Chiang Kai-shek, comparing Chiang Kai-shek to "a rare hero, a great man of the times." The pamphlets issued by the Catholic Patriotic Association slandered the people's government's religious policies, saying, "The Communist Party and Catholicism are like black and white. If one exists, the other will perish. Where there is the Communist Party, there is no Catholicism, and where there is Catholicism, there is no Communist Party," and so on. In addition, they asked "members" to report on the situation in each class, investigate which teacher was the most progressive and what they were teaching in class, and which student was the most progressive and which Catholic student was approaching progressive elements. Then, they ordered the "members" to closely monitor and crack down on the activities of progressive teachers and students.

　　The weekly meeting was a "routine meeting." Usually, there were meetings in Man Jishi's room almost every night. Wang Qinggui, a worker at the school, had to wait every night to open the school gate for Man and others. Man Jishi, Wang Jiwu, and others, based on the reports of the "members," separately decided on methods to attack progressive teachers and control the student union. For example, they invited the imperialist element, Dutch priest Zheng Huamin, to openly spread reactionary ideas in the classroom and refute materialistic viewpoints.

　　Secretly Showing Reactionary Films, Sabotaging the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea

　　After the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea was launched, Man, Wang, and others openly carried out deceptive propaganda for American imperialism, attempting to blur the students' awareness of resisting America and aiding Korea, and sabotage the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Man Jishi often said to the students, "Resist America, aid Korea, you're all crazy!" "In a certain battle in Korea, the Chinese army died more than 10,000 people in one go. How can the Chinese army fight?" Under the pretext of celebrating the Soviet October Revolution, they publicly showed the reactionary American film "Negro Soldier" at the meeting, instilling in all teachers and students reactionary and poisonous ideas such as "America is powerful," "America is free," and "American weapons are so powerful." Although the students raised questions and protests at the time, they sophistically said that they were learning the "strengths" of the enemy. Man, Wang, and others often showed reactionary films hidden in the school's audio-visual classroom after the secret meetings of the "Legion of Mary," such as "Naval Life," "Military Tactics," and "Military Plans," which promoted aggressive warfare, "Japanese Attack on Jinzhou," "Japanese Education," "Japanese Transportation," "Post-War Guam," "G5 Troops in Europe," which promoted fascist power, and "Circus," which promoted the Japanese invaders sweeping away our heroic anti-Japanese Eighth Route Army. In addition to poisoning Catholic students, Man, Wang, and others also displayed reactionary books and pictures in the Xikai Middle School library, such as "The Autobiography of Mussolini," "American Naval Life," "Such a Society," and other extremely reactionary books, as well as more than 60 pictures of the American Voice, American Democratic Elections, American Relief Work, and anti-Soviet propaganda produced by the United States Information Service, which has consistently spread rumors and hatred against the Chinese people.

　　Performing Absurd Dramatic Programs, Slandering the People

　　Man Jishi and Wang Jiwu were very hostile to the victory of the Chinese people and the growth of progressive forces in the school. They adhered to their reactionary stance, ordered public teachers and students to vigorously mobilize ordinary public teachers and students to participate in the reactionary organization "Legion of Mary," and mobilized ordinary students to believe in religion. Those who made "achievements" in developing their "organization" were "commended" and "encouraged" in various ways.

　　During their time at the school, they consistently led members of the "Legion of Mary" in anti-communist and anti-people activities, and often invited international spies and special agents, such as Bu Xiangxian, to the school to give absurd propaganda lectures against communism. On National Day in 1950, they even staged reactionary dramas in the school auditorium that slandered national policies and hated the people, such as "Celebrating National Day" and "Beautifying Life." The content of the play "Celebrating National Day" was as follows: a clown standing on the stage said, "I am the commander of wiping buttocks. Today is the birthday of the Communist Party, which is also my birthday. You kowtow to me!" After he finished speaking, a group of clowns came out and kowtowed to him, and the play ended. In the fall of 1950, on the way back from welcoming the world youth representatives to Tianjin, Wang and others led students to shout reactionary slogans such as "Long live Chiang Kai-shek!" and "Long live Truman!" The reactionary teacher Jin Zhaoheng openly insulted the Communist Party and the Youth League, and Man Jishi praised Jin as the most "brave" Chinese.

　　Consistently Attacking Progressive Teachers and Students, Hostile to Education Laws and Regulations

　　They tried every means to control the Xikai Middle School Student Union, attack progressive teachers and students, and obstruct the development of the Youth League in Xikai. For example, the first student union after liberation was controlled by Man and Wang, and the chairman was elected by Catholic students. They had dismissed four progressive teachers before and after, and conspired to dismiss the school's progressive teachers Cao Anshi and Su Baoyuan. Therefore, the imperialist element Wen Guibin had repeatedly praised them for their meritorious service in "working for Xikai (imperialism)." They refused to implement the educational policies promulgated by the people's government. After liberation, Man Jishi illegally taught religious lessons "Religious Essentials" in the school and openly preached in the school. In the summer of 1950, after Wang Jiwu finished the Tianjin Secondary Education Conference, he returned to school and conveyed only a few words. Usually, he did not plan, inspect, or summarize. At a study meeting, Wang Jiwu talked nonsense about a Taoist in Beijing who meditated for seven days without eating or drinking.

　　Secretly Forming Alliances to Plot the Assassination of Patriotic Catholics and Sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Movement

　　Man Jishi was extremely hostile to, obstructed, and sabotaged the Catholic self-governance and renovation movement initiated by anti-imperialist and patriotic Catholics in Tianjin. Man Jishi openly and shamelessly said: "Religion is pure. The church has not been used by imperialism. Whoever says it has been used by imperialism is a traitor to the church." "During the Qing Dynasty, foreign missionaries came to preach the gospel in order to save the souls of the Chinese people, which was good for China." He ordered members of the "Legion of Mary" to obstruct the signing of Catholic believers. Recently, Man also colluded with a small number of core members of the "Legion of Mary" to form a counter-revolutionary secret alliance, plotting to assassinate patriotic Catholics such as Wu Kezhai. At the same time, a secret transceiver was found in Wang Jiwu's home, fully proving the crimes of Man, Wang, and others in organizing the counter-revolutionary organization "Legion of Mary" to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.

　　“圣母军”在西开中学的罪恶活动
    一九四八年夏，帝国主义分子荷籍神甫满济世和特务分子王际五（均被我逮捕）秉承文贵宾麻醉奴化中国人民的意旨，先后打进西开中学，组织反革命组织“圣母军”（又名“圣母御侍团”、“圣母慈爱祈祷会”），阴谋毒化我青年，发展组织，将西开中学变成天津市的一个反动堡垒，与中国人民革命为敌。
  威胁、利诱、欺骗，非法发展组织
    王际五、满济世到校后，王任校长，满任总务主任，利用职位的便利，就积极发展反动组织，先成立“圣母军”“至圣玫瑰之后”支会，后又发展了“宗徒之后”、“无玷之后”、“上天之门”三支会，利用威胁、利诱、欺骗种种手段在校吸收公教师生加入，终于从几个人发展到几十人。
    他们假宗教之名行反动之实的麻醉、欺骗、毒化青年的手段，毒辣阴险，无所不至。在吸收团员时，不但吸收中学公教生参加，而且吸收西开小学学生参加，西开各支会最小的“会员”只有十一、二岁，他们给同学以小恩小惠，如给同学买东西吃，送给一些破烂衣服，或是代交学费等，也引诱笼络公教同学。西开中学的许多公教师生都受到他们的欺骗，在有意无意间，作了帝国主义分子的爪牙，干出不少反动的危害人民的勾当。
  造谣、诬蔑、破坏，散播反动言论
    “圣母军”每周开会一次，在会上王、满等经常散布反动言论，如满济世常对同学说：“现在教会是受难的，我们不要怕，我们要勇敢。”他威胁同学说：“共产党是魔鬼，不要和他们接近，和他们接近，会给他们引诱去的。”“少和青年团员接近，少参加大会。”并散发反动小册子，如歌颂蒋匪介石的小册子把蒋匪比做：“稀世英雄，当代伟人。”天主教教务协进会印发的诬蔑人民政府宗教政策的小册子说道：“共产党与天主教势若黑白，此存则彼亡，有共产党就没有天主教，有天主教就没有共产党”等。此外，就让“团员”汇报各班的情况，调查那个老师最进步，课堂上讲的是什么？那个同学最进步，那个公教生与进步分子接近，然后，就命令“团员”密切注意和打击进步师生的活动。
    每周一次的会是“例会”，平时在满济世房间内几乎每晚都有会，该校工友王庆贵每晚都要等着给满等开校门。满济世、王际五等根据“团员”的汇报，即分别定下打击进步教员、掌握学生会的方法，如请帝国主义分子荷籍神甫郑化民在课堂上公开散布反动思想，反驳唯物论观点等。
  秘密放映反动影片，破坏抗美援朝
    抗美援朝运动展开后，满、王等竟公然替美帝国主义进行欺骗宣传，企图模糊同学们抗美援朝的意识，破坏抗美援朝运动。满济世时常对同学说：“抗嘛美，援嘛朝，你们都疯了！”“朝鲜某战役中国军队一次就死了一万多人，中国军队怎么能打仗。”他们并假借庆祝苏联十月革命节名义，在会上公开放映反动的美国电影《黑人兵》，给全体师生灌输以“美国强大”、“美国自由”、“美国武器如何厉害”等反动毒害思想，当时同学虽提出质问和抗议，但他们却诡辩说是要学习敌人的“长处”。满、王等更经常在“圣母军”秘密会后演出该校电教室内匿藏的反动影片，如宣传侵略战争的《海军生活》、《作战法》、《军事计划》等，宣传法西斯威力的《日本进攻锦州》、《日本之教育》、《日本交通与运输》、《战后关岛》、《Ｇ五部队在欧洲》等，和宣扬日寇扫荡我英勇抗战八路军的《马戏团》等。满、王等除了毒化公教同学外，还在西开中学图书馆内陈设反动图书和画片，如《莫索里尼自传》、《美国海军生活》、《如此社会》等极端反动书籍多种，并有一贯造谣仇视中国人民的美国新闻处所制的宣传《美国之音》、《美国民主选举》、《美国救济工作》和反苏图片六十余张。
  演出荒谬戏剧节目，诬蔑人民
    满济世和王际五对于中国人民的胜利和学校中进步力量的增长是十分仇视的，他们坚持其反动立场，命令公教师生大肆发动一般公教师生参加反动组织“圣母军”，发动一般同学信教，凡是发展其“组织”有“成绩”的，都用各种方式加以“表扬”和“鼓励”。
    他们在校时期一贯领导着“圣母军”会员进行反共反人民的活动，经常请国际间谍及特务卜相贤等来校作反共的荒谬宣传讲演，一九五○年国庆节，竟在该校礼堂演出诬蔑国家政策、仇视人民的反动话剧《庆祝国庆》和《美化人生》等剧，《庆祝国庆》一剧内容，由一扮小丑的站在台前说：“我是擦屁股司令，今天是共产党的生日，也就是我的生日，你们给我磕头！”言罢紧跟着出来一群小丑向他磕头，此剧即告了事。一九五○年秋，在欢迎世界青年代表来津的归途中，王等竟领导同学喊“蒋介石万岁！”“杜鲁门万岁！”等反动口号，该校反动教员金兆珩公开污辱共产党、青年团，而满济世竟称赞金为最“勇敢”的中国人。
  一贯打击进步师生，敌视教育法令
    他们想尽种种方法控制西开中学学生会，打击进步师生，阻挠青年团在西开发展，如解放后第一任学生会在满和王的控制下，即由公教生当选主席，他们前后曾撤换进步教员四人，并阴谋解聘该校进步教员曹安石、苏保瑗。因此，帝国主义分子文贵宾曾多次表扬他们“为西开（帝国主义）出力”有功。他们拒不实施人民政府所颁布的教育政策，解放后，满济世仍非法在校内讲宗教课“宗教要理”、公开在校内传教。一九五○年夏，王际五开完了天津市中等教育会议后，回校传达只三言五语就算了事。平时更不计划、不检查、也不总结，在某次学习会上，王际五竟大谈北京某道士打坐七天不食不饮的荒谬谈话。
  秘密结盟阴谋暗害爱国教徒破坏三自运动
    满济世更极端仇视、阻挠、破坏天津反帝爱国教友发起的天主教自立革新运动，满济世公开无耻地说：“宗教是纯洁的，教会没有被帝国主义利用。谁说被帝国主义利用，谁就是叛教。”“清朝时，外国教士来传教，为的是来救中国人的灵魂，对中国有好处。”命令“圣母军”团员阻挠教友签名。最近满并纠合少数“圣母军”骨干分子组织反革命秘密结盟，阴谋暗害爱国教徒吴克斋等，同时，并在王际五家中搜获秘密收发报机，充分证明了满、王等组织反革命组织“圣母军”阴谋进行反革命活动的罪行。
