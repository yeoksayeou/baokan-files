　　Special-Class Hero Cui Jianguo
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent Zheng Dafan
    In the spring counter-offensive, Cui Jianguo, a communist party member and platoon leader of the Second Platoon of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, performed a special-class feat in the battle of Jialishan north of Hongchuan, where the American 38th Regiment was annihilated. After the battle, he was awarded the title of "Special-Class Hero." He is an excellent commander and an extraordinarily brave fighter. Before the counter-offensive began, he led his soldiers in learning tactics and techniques, and vomited blood due to overwork. His superiors asked him to rest for a few days, but he refused, saying, "Seeing with my own eyes the disasters suffered by the Korean people, and thinking of the threats to the motherland, how can I go down to rest because of this minor illness?"
    After the counter-offensive began, Cui Jianguo's platoon, after several requests, was assigned the task of storming the 752 Height in Jialishan. Cui Jianguo divided the entire platoon into four groups, like four sharp knives, and inserted them directly into the four bunkers on the small hill in front of the height, quickly killing all eighteen American soldiers in the bunkers. Then he divided the team into two groups and attacked the second hill, which was about 200 meters high. The defending enemy fled at the sight of them. The height was occupied in just five minutes. Three American soldiers who did not have time to escape were killed by Cui Jianguo with a grenade. The two battles on the front of the height ended in just ten minutes. The Second Platoon quickly covered the main force in capturing the 752 Height.
    As the main force of the Volunteer Army continued to advance towards Dashuidong, where the headquarters of the American 38th Regiment was located, the warriors of the Second Platoon bravely inserted themselves onto the highway leading to Hongchuan, cutting off the enemy's motorcade. In order to remove this sharp sword inserted into his spine, the enemy launched a group charge. In this close-quarters battle, the Volunteer Army warriors fully utilized the power of light weapons, and the enemy fell in pieces in response to the gunfire. Cui Jianguo loudly encouraged his comrades, saying, "Hit them hard! Comrades, these are such good targets! One bullet can take down two or three of them!" He held his automatic rifle and fired in bursts for more than ten minutes. When the bullets ran out, he picked up two newly captured automatic carbines and fired them simultaneously. After firing the bullets, he changed to a machine gun and fired again. In order to escape the fate of being completely annihilated, the enemy, regardless of heavy casualties, still desperately counterattacked and launched a bayonet melee on the position. Cui Jianguo picked up a carbine with a bayonet and jumped out of the fortifications, stabbing the foremost American soldier, piercing the guy's chest. He pulled out the bayonet and stabbed five more American soldiers in a row, bending the bayonet. The beasts' filthy blood splattered all over him; he himself was also wounded in the hand and leg. Encouraged by Cui Jianguo, his comrades also showed unparalleled heroism. Ammunition handler Wu Yin became pinned to the ground by an enemy, he bit off the enemy's ear, and the enemy fled holding his bloody head. Machine gunner Wei Ming smashed the heads of two enemies with a shovel. Squad leader Shen Xuekong was wounded in four places, and still fought bravely with the enemy. This earth-shattering melee frightened the American soldiers into a rout. Six enemies, their legs weakened by fear, knelt down in front of Cui Jianguo.
    The next night, the Second Platoon received the task of attacking the mountain on the right side of Dashuidong. The heroes, who had fought fiercely all night, were encouraged by the ambition to annihilate the enemy and forgot their fatigue, and bravely and quickly inserted themselves into the enemy's position. The warriors threw a burst of grenades, and the enemy fled in fright, leaving only a heavy machine gun on the hilltop to cover their retreat. Cui Jianguo went around behind the enemy machine gunner, grabbed his disheveled long hair, pulled him out of the fortifications, and also captured a heavy machine gun.
    In these two nights of battle, Cui Jianguo alone killed more than twenty enemies, stabbed six to death, and captured seven prisoners; captured a chemical mortar, a heavy machine gun, two carbines, and five automatic rifles. Under his outstanding command, the Second Platoon excellently cooperated with the main force to annihilate most of the American 38th Regiment. After the battle, Cui Jianguo was promoted to company commander of the Ninth Company. At a meeting of heroes and models held by a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, Cui Jianguo said modestly, "As a member of the Chinese Communist Party, this little achievement is nothing. I will kill more enemies in the next battle and perform meritorious service for the people of the world."

　　特等功臣崔建国
    新华社通讯员  郑大藩
    在春季反击战中，中国人民志愿军某部第二排排长共产党员崔建国，在洪川以北痛歼美军第三十八团的加里山战斗中，立了特等功，战后荣获“特等功臣”的称号。他是一个优秀的指挥员，也是一个勇猛非凡的斗士。在反击战发起以前，他带领着战士们学习战术和技术，因为操劳过度而吐了血。上级要他休养几天，他拒绝说：“亲眼看到朝鲜人民所受的灾难，想想祖国所受的威胁，我怎么能够因为这一点小病就下去休养呢？”
    反击战开始以后，崔建国这个排经过几次要求，担任了攻取加里山七五二高地的突击队任务。崔建国把全排分成四个小组，像四把尖刀一样直插高地前沿小山头上的四个地堡，迅速将地堡中的十八个美国兵全部打死。接着他又将队伍分成两路，攻击第二个高约二百公尺的山头，山头守敌望风而逃。只五分钟功夫，高地就被占领。来不及逃的三个美国兵，被崔建国的一颗手榴弹炸死了。高地前沿的两次战斗只十分钟就结束了。第二排迅速地掩护主力攻占了七五二高地。
    志愿军主力继续插向美军第三十八团团部所在地大水洞时，二排的勇士们又勇猛地插到通往洪川的公路上，把敌人的汽车群拦腰截断。敌人为了要拔除这柄插在他背脊上的利剑，就发起了集团冲锋。在这短兵相接的战斗中，志愿军勇士们充分发挥了轻火器的威力，敌人应着枪声一片片地倒下去。崔建国大声鼓励他的战友们说：“猛打！同志们，这是多么好的目标呀！一颗子弹可以穿倒他两三个！”他端着自动枪用点发接连打了十多分钟。子弹打光了，他双手拿起刚缴来的两支自动卡宾枪同时发射，打完子弹以后又换上一挺机关枪打。敌人为了要逃脱全部被歼的命运，不顾惨重伤亡，依旧拚死反扑，在阵地上展开了白刃肉搏战。崔建国拿起一支上了刺刀的卡宾枪跳出工事，对准最前面的一个美国兵刺过去，穿透了这个家伙的胸膛。他拔出刺刀又接连刺死了五个美国兵，把刺刀都刺弯了。野兽们的污血溅得他一身；他自己手上、腿上也负了伤。在崔建国的鼓舞之下，他的战友们也表现了无比的英雄气概。弹药手吴银成被一个敌人压在地下，他咬掉了敌人的耳朵，敌人抱着污血淋漓的头逃跑了。机枪射手魏明用圆锹劈碎了两个敌人的头。班长申学孔身负四处伤，还和敌人勇猛拚杀。这一场惊天动地的肉搏战，吓得美国兵狼狈溃逃。有六个吓软了腿的敌人就在崔建国的面前跪了下来。
    第二天夜晚，第二排又接受了攻打大水洞右侧山头的任务，经过了昨夜一整夜猛战的英雄们，被歼敌的雄心鼓舞着，忘却了疲劳，果敢迅速地插向敌阵。勇士们打出一阵手榴弹，敌人就吓跑了，只在山头上留一挺重机枪掩护溃逃。崔建国绕到敌人机枪手背后，一把抓住他蓬乱的长头发，把他从工事里捉了出来，还缴了一挺重机枪。
    在这两夜的战斗中，崔建国一个人打死了二十多个敌人，刺死了六个，捉了七个俘虏；缴了一门化学炮，一挺重机枪，两支卡宾枪和五支自动步枪。在他的卓越指挥下，第二排出色地配合着主力，将美军第三十八团大部歼灭。战后崔建国被提升为九连连长。在志愿军某部举行的英雄模范座谈会上，崔建国谦逊地说：“作为一个中国共产党党员，这点功绩算不了什么。我要在下次战斗中，杀死更多的敌人，为世界人民立功。”
