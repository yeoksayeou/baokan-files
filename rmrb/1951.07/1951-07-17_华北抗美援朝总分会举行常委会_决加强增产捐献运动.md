　　North China Branch of the China Resist America Aid Korea General Association Holds Standing Committee Meeting
　　Resolves to Strengthen Production Increase and Donation Campaign
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Branch of the China Resist America Aid Korea General Association held its second Standing Committee meeting on July 13 to discuss the Korean armistice negotiations and the continued strengthening of the Resist America Aid Korea movement in the North China region. Thirty-one standing committee members and attendees were present. After a heated discussion, the meeting unanimously approved Comrade Nie Zhen, chairman of the branch, report on strengthening the Resist America Aid Korea movement in North China.
    The report analyzed the current situation, pointing out that the Resist America Aid Korea movement must not be relaxed in the slightest due to the armistice negotiations, and the donation campaign must continue in conjunction with increased production. Since the National Resist America Aid Korea General Association put forward three patriotic calls, the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in various parts of North China has been universally high, and the donation campaign has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, the region has donated 260 aircraft and 45 artillery pieces; however, the development of the movement still has the shortcoming of unevenness, which should be corrected in a timely manner. The report emphasized that all cadres and activists must recognize the significance of the donation movement, which is a patriotic movement that achieves three goals at once: first, to improve the people's political understanding; second, to promote the production movement; and third, to donate weapons. To do this work well, it is first necessary to carry out universal and in-depth patriotic education and propaganda work and meticulous organizational work. At the same time, the patriotic donation movement must be combined with the production increase plan. Mobilize the broad masses of the people to generally formulate production increase plans, and then, based on the income from the production increase plans, decide to donate part or all of it, which will both increase the income of the people and the country and complete the donation plan. The production increase plan should be the main content of the patriotic pact, and the patriotic pact must ensure the regular implementation of the production increase plan. All parts of the region must conduct a check on the patriotic pact, and wherever the donation work is not combined with production increase or is not well combined, a practical and feasible production increase plan must be re-established in the patriotic pact. We must popularize this production increase and donation plan to every factory, every rural area, and every household in North China. In particular, it must be emphasized that the proposed donation figures should be based on the masses' conscious willingness. Places where the donation movement is poorly developed or has not yet been carried out must vigorously carry out in-depth mobilization of the masses to gradually catch up with advanced areas, so that the movement in the whole region will develop towards balance and depth. For those who, out of high patriotic enthusiasm, propose donation figures that are beyond their capabilities, such as workers and students, we should, on the one hand, commend their patriotic enthusiasm, and on the other hand, persuade them to reduce the donation figures and guide them to improve the donation methods. In addition, in order to further improve the work of preferential treatment and cultivation on behalf of the families of soldiers, Comrade Nie Zhen called on all localities to conduct a general inspection of preferential treatment work around the "August 1st" Army Day,慰问烈属军属; and earnestly assist the people's government to further mobilize the masses to carry out regular preferential treatment work. The work of cultivation on behalf of others must be included in the patriotic pact, and the implementation situation must be checked regularly.

　　华北抗美援朝总分会举行常委会
　  决加强增产捐献运动
    【本报讯】华北抗美援朝总分会于七月十三日举行第二次常务委员会，讨论朝鲜停战谈判问题与继续加强华北区抗美援朝运动问题。到会常委及列席者三十一人。会议经过热烈讨论，一致同意该总分会主席聂真同志关于加强华北区抗美援朝运动的报告。
    该报告分析了目前形势，指出抗美援朝运动不能因停战谈判而丝毫松懈，必须结合增加生产继续贯彻捐献运动。自全国抗美援朝总会提出三项爱国号召后，全华北区各地人民爱国热情普遍高涨，捐献运动已获很大成绩。据目前不完全的统计，全区已捐献飞机二百六十架，大炮四十五门；但运动的发展还存在不平衡的缺点，应及时纠正。报告强调指出：所有干部、积极分子必须认清捐献运动的意义、捐献运动是一个一举三得的爱国运动：第一、提高人民的政治认识，第二、推进生产运动，第三、捐献了武器。要作好这一工作，首先要普遍深入进行爱国主义教育宣传工作及细致的组织工作。同时，爱国捐献运动必须与增产计划相结合。发动广大人民普遍订立增产计划，然后根据增产计划的收入，决定捐出一部或全部，这样既增加了人民及国家的收入又完成了捐献计划。增产计划要作为爱国公约的主要内容，爱国公约必须保证增产计划的经常贯彻执行。全区各地对爱国公约均须进行一次检查，凡是捐献工作未与增产结合或结合得不好的，必须在爱国公约中重新订立切实可行的增产计划。我们要把这种增产捐献计划，普及到全华北区各个工厂、各个农村、各个家户中去。特别要强调捐献数字的提出，要根据群众的自觉自愿。捐献运动开展较差或尚未进行的地方，必须大力进行深入的发动群众工作，以求逐步赶上先进地区，使全区的运动向平衡、深入方面展开。对于因高度的爱国热情，提出力不能及的捐献数字者，如工人、学生中即有这种现象，应一方面表扬其爱国热情，一方面劝其减少捐献数字，并指导其改善捐献方法。此外，为进一步作好优抚代耕工作，聂真同志号召各地根据全国抗美援朝总会的通知，在“八一”建军节前后，普遍检查一次优抚工作，慰问烈属军属；并切实协助人民政府，进一步发动群众，开展经常的优抚工作。代耕工作须订入爱国公约中，定期检查执行情形。
