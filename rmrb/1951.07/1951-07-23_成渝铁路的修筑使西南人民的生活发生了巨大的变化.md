　　The Construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Has Brought Great Changes to the Lives of the People in Southwest China
　　Special Correspondent for this newspaper, Gao Lisheng
(I)
　　To commemorate the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers constructing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway worked day and night, laying tracks to Yongchuan City, 165 kilometers from Chongqing, before "July 1st." On the morning of July 1st, the first train from Caiyuanba Station in Chongqing to Yongchuan was warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. At Yongchuan Station alone, more than 20,000 people gathered. How excited the people of Southwest China were to celebrate this joyous event!
　　Looking back to June 15th last year, when the Chongqing newspapers published the news of the groundbreaking ceremony for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, many people were skeptical. They thought: the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway had been talked about for more than forty years. From the Manchu feudal dynasty, the Northern Warlords, the Sichuan warlords, to the Kuomintang reactionary government, who wasn't clamoring for "road construction"? However, the people of Sichuan had seen no sleepers or rails for more than forty years, only seeing the promises of road construction turn into a sky full of lies. Although the People's Government was different from the reactionary governments of the past, in Southwest China, which had been liberated for less than half a year, with extremely difficult finances and rampant bandits in various places, where would the strength come from to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway all at once? Now, the skeptical people have seen clearly that the People's Government is fully capable of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway with its own strength. The people's long-term desire has become a reality.
　　In addition to engineering design, the first difficulty encountered in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was the need for a large number of masons, stonemasons, and skilled technical workers. Where could these be found? Therefore, the People's Liberation Army formed a military-industrial road construction team of more than 22,000 people to serve as the main force in road construction and play a leading role. General Zhou Shidi, Deputy Commander of the Southwest Military Region, issued a resounding call at the groundbreaking ceremony of the military-industrial road construction: "We have overthrown the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which is a concentrated manifestation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. This is glorious. Now we are building railways, which is the construction of a new society. This is also glorious!" Thousands upon thousands of commanders and soldiers requested to participate in the railway construction work. However, there were still many difficulties: such as insufficient materials and unfamiliar technology. The first time they blasted a mountain to open a path, they did not know how to drill blast holes of a certain depth according to the slope of the mountain and the firmness of the rock. In order to achieve quick results, the blast holes were drilled four feet deep, which could not be blasted open, wasting manpower and materials. Comrades who had never held a sledgehammer would either hit the hand of the comrade holding the iron drill or hit their leg when drilling blast holes. The military-industrial workers participating in the road construction maintained the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, not fearing any difficulties in front of them, and correctly implementing the instructions of General Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar of the Southwest Military Region, to overcome difficulties: "Effort determines everything, technology determines everything, and unity determines everything." Regardless of the scorching heat or continuous rain, they always maintained a full labor mood, carefully studied technology and improved technology. When the blast holes were not accurate, everyone encouraged each other: "Just hit it a few more times." Tang Huang, the squad leader of the sixth squad of the fifth company, in order to learn how to drill blast holes, did not rest at noon in the scorching heat, but found a stone and practiced on the road. They asked engineers and stonemasons for advice, held "Zhuge Liang meetings" to learn and exchange experience, and improve technology. They completed the construction orders as if they were combat missions, and generally completed the tasks ahead of schedule. The second detachment of the fourth general detachment of the military-industrial corps created the achievement of completing four months' worth of tasks in fifty-two days, which made the engineers sincerely admire them. The heroes who were "invincible in attack and invincible in battle" on the battlefield also showed the same noble qualities in railway construction.
　　Another force in road construction was more than 20,000 unemployed workers from Chongqing and various parts of Southwest China, including 1,200 vagrants and beggars taken in by Chongqing; as well as former bandits, hooligans, and old military officers and soldiers. These people were still naughty and mischievous when they first arrived at the construction site, and were unwilling to work hard; but after the patient education of the military-industrial cadres, they helped them study politics and improve their class consciousness; many people who had acquired bad habits changed their ways. The average work efficiency increased from only 25% of the standard work in the early stage to 150%. Many people have become road construction heroes. Hundreds of unemployed workers in the engineering brigade have learned the specialized technology of track laying and become formal employees of the railway bureau. Many more workers are studying in road maintenance training classes, and gradually become the backbone on various work posts on the construction site.
　　This year, more than 100,000 civilian workers have been mobilized and organized in various places to start work on the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway line, and the project is progressing rapidly. More than 50% of the earthwork and stonework has been completed. In actual labor, the road construction civilian workers have been trained to become a majestic labor force with organization and discipline. In a short period of time, they have mastered road construction technology and emerged in large numbers as activists. This fully shows that the Chinese people are not only diligent, but also intelligent and talented.
(II)
　　How to ensure the supply of road construction materials is a major issue that must be resolved. In the era of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the materials for railway construction were completely dependent on capitalist countries, and even a sleeper and a rail spike had to be bought from abroad. The People's Government adopted the policy of "relying on the collective wisdom and strength, and obtaining materials locally." In this way, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has brought great changes to the lives of industrial and commercial enterprises and the masses of people in Sichuan, especially driving the recovery and development of industry and commerce. Taking Chongqing as an example, due to the long-term economic aggression of American imperialism and the destruction when the Chiang bandit gang retreated, two-thirds of the mines and factories were often shut down when it was first liberated, and more than 100,000 workers had no work to do. Heavy industries such as machinery and steel were basically at a standstill. The large number of machines and tools needed for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway revived Chongqing's industry. The state-owned economy drove the private economy, and the People's Government supported the production of private industrial and mining enterprises by processing orders and lending large amounts of funds. For example, after accepting orders for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Yuxin Iron and Steel Plant largely restored production in its general plant and ten branch plants. Li Zhiqin, the manager of the plant, said: "The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has saved the factory's productive forces. Now we are not afraid of not having work to do, but we are afraid that we will not be able to produce what we have ordered. The factory has also changed from just consuming capital in the past to being profitable." Almost all 428 private machinery factories have received orders. All 185 large iron shops in the iron industry have also accepted orders. The solution to the production problems of the steel, machinery, and iron industries has increased the need for iron smelting, promoting the recovery and development of the local iron industry in various parts of Sichuan. During the Anti-Japanese War, when foreign iron could not be imported, Sichuan's local iron factories had the opportunity to develop, and there were more than 200 iron factories, with an annual output of 30,000 to 40,000 tons. The ordnance factories and steel plants in various parts of Southwest China used it as raw materials for steelmaking and iron smelting. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American iron was imported in a steady stream, and almost all local iron industries stopped production. In order to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the People's Government vigorously supported the resumption of production in the iron industry, and purchased thousands of tons of local iron from Xuanhan and Wanyuan areas in northern Sichuan, Weiyuan area in southern Sichuan, and Qijiang area in eastern Sichuan by paying for the goods in advance, enabling nearly 100 local iron industries to resume production in the above three areas. Sichuan's cement industry shut down six months before liberation, and workers only received one-third of their wages each month as a living allowance. Due to the orders for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the resumption of production in various factories and mines, the production of cement in this industry has been unable to meet the demand, and the production volume has reached the highest record. Due to the recovery of the industrial and mining industries and shipping, the coal industry, brick and tile, electrical equipment, chemical industry, and hardware commerce have also developed accordingly. The funds put into the market through the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are very large, and the associated commerce is also becoming increasingly prosperous.
　　The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway needs a large number of sleepers, which was impossible to solve in the era of the reactionary government. However, after the Southwest Financial and Economic Commission convened a sleeper meeting, combined with production, disaster relief, and relief for unemployed workers, it organized and mobilized hundreds of thousands of people along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to fell and transport sleepers. The vast masses of people have a high enthusiasm for building people's railways. The entire line needs a total of 1,085,000 sleepers. In nine months, the railway bureau has received 825,000 sleepers from various places, which cannot be used up for track laying this year. Through the logging and transportation of sleepers, combined with the central work of the countryside, the peasant masses have been mobilized and educated. At the same time, it has increased the income of farmers, enlivened the rural economy, and also made the Renminbi penetrate into the countryside. For example, in Xuyong, Gulin and other counties where there is a shortage of Renminbi, the people used barter methods. Due to the purchase of sleepers, a certain amount of Renminbi and industrial products were sent to the countryside, which initially changed the trade relations in the countryside.
　　The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has greatly helped the development of small and medium-sized industries and commerce in towns along the line. The opening of mountains requires a large amount of explosive raw materials, which has revived the long-stagnant sulfur industry in Yongchuan and other places. Local brick and tile factories and lime factories have also expanded production in response to demand. As for commerce, 250 stores in Neijiang alone have reopened three months ago. The wages obtained by civilian workers in southern Sichuan in 1951 are about 300 million catties of rice, and other income is even greater. Unemployment has been greatly reduced, and the vast masses of people have found a way out. The masses who have initially improved their lives directly or indirectly due to road construction include 150,000 people in Longchang, Neijiang and other five counties in southern Sichuan. Almost all stonemasons in various counties participated in road construction, and ironsmiths and carpenters made the tools and furniture needed for road construction. Women hammered ballast stones and gravel, and could earn more than three liters of rice per day.
(III)
　　The military-industrial workers, farmers, and unemployed workers who built the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway totaled more than 100,000. They worked, lived, and studied together, like a large-scale training class. Especially in the great movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the land reform movement, they received class education and patriotic education, learned some cultural knowledge, improved their ideological awareness, closely contacted the masses in the驻地, and also educated the masses, becoming a team with good discipline and concern for the interests of the masses; when they returned to various rural areas, they would become activists or lower-level cadres of farmers, which is also a great gain in rural political construction.
　　On the other hand, organizing the masses along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to participate in road protection work has consolidated the high enthusiasm of the vast masses of farmers in participating in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Along the line from Chongqing to Zhuyangxi, 13,110 road protection team members have been organized, half of whom are women, and have been organized into brigades, companies, platoons, and groups. They have played a great role in preventing bad people from sabotaging, assisting in repairing collapsed projects, protecting newly planted trees and telecommunications equipment, warning of dangers to avoid train accidents, and capturing counter-revolutionaries. Their slogan is: "Where the railway tracks are laid, the mass road protection teams are organized there, and a road protection patriotic convention is formulated." This kind of regular mass organization not only plays a great role in protecting railway safety, but also has great significance for local security, anti-espionage, and guarding against spies. At the same time, political and cultural propaganda and education are often carried out to the masses through the organization of road protection teams.
(IV)
　　In the future, after the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is opened to traffic, it will have a great effect on the development of the rural economy in Sichuan, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and the economic construction along the railway. Sichuan has always been known as the "Land of Abundance." The Chengdu Plain is the granary of Sichuan, with a large amount of grain and abundant agricultural products, as well as the famous Zigong well salt and Neijiang sugarcane, and many local products, specialties, and medicinal materials. Due to the lack of modern transportation equipment, transportation costs are high and cannot be exported. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will closely link the rich agricultural products, local products, and specialties of western Sichuan with foreign markets through the Yangtze River shipping, greatly increasing people's income. At the same time, it will create favorable conditions for the future development of the rich resources in Xikang and other places, and is also the starting point for the construction of basic industries in Southwest China.

　　成渝铁路的修筑使西南人民的生活发生了巨大的变化
    本报特约记者　高丽生
  （一）
    修筑成渝铁路的工人们，为纪念中国共产党的生日，日夜加工，于“七一”前铺轨到距重庆一百六十五公里的永川城。七月一日晨，由重庆菜园坝车站开往永川的第一列火车，受到沿路群众的热烈欢迎，仅永川车站就聚集了二万多群众。西南人民是多么兴奋地庆祝这一件喜事啊！
    回想在去年六月十五日，重庆各报发表了成渝铁路举行开工典礼消息的时候，许多人曾经抱着怀疑态度。他们认为：修筑成渝铁路，已叫喊了四十多年，从满清封建王朝、北洋军阀、四川军阀、国民党反动政府，那个不在叫唤“筑路”？可是，四川人民四十多年来，看不见一根枕木和钢轨，只看见修路的诺言变成了满天的谎话。人民政府虽与过去的反动政府不同，但在西南解放不到半年，财政极度困难，各地土匪还很猖獗的情况下，那里来的力量，一下就要修筑成渝铁路呢？现在，怀疑的人们都已看清楚了，他们相信，人民政府完全能用自己的力量修好成渝铁路。人民长期的渴望变为现实了。
    成渝铁路的修筑，除了工程设计外，首先遇到的困难，就是需要大批的泥工、石工及熟练的技术工人，这从那里去找呢？于是，人民解放军组成了二万二千余人的军工筑路队，担任筑路的主力，起带头示范作用。西南军区副司令员周士第将军在兵工筑路开工典礼大会上，发出响亮的号召：“我们把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义集中表现的国民党反动派蒋介石匪帮的统治推倒了，这是光荣的；现在来修筑铁路，就是新社会的建设，这也是光荣的！”成千成万的指战员请求参加修筑铁路工作。但是，困难仍是很多的：如料具不足，技术生疏等等。第一次放炮开山的时候，不懂得根据山坡的斜度及石质的坚松，打一定深度的炮眼，为了急于求成，炮眼打成四尺深，炸不开，浪费人力物力。没有拿过铁锤的同志，打炮眼时，铁锤不是打在扶铁签的同志的手上，就是打到腿上。参加筑路的军工，都保持着人民解放军一贯的光荣传统，不怕横在面前的任何困难，正确地执行西南军区政治委员邓小平将军克服困难的指示：“努力决定一切，技术决定一切，团结决定一切。”不管是酷暑和霪雨，始终保持着饱满的劳动情绪，精心钻研技术与改进技术。炮眼打不准确时，大家互相鼓励着：“多打几次就行了。”五中队六班长唐煌为学会打炮眼，酷暑天中午不休息，找块石头在路上练习打。他们请教工程师、石工，开“诸葛亮会”，学习与交流经验，提高技术。把施工命令当成战斗任务一样来完成，一般的都提前完成了任务。军工四总队二支队创造了五十二天完成四个月的任务的成绩，使工程师都不能不衷心感佩。在战场上“攻无不克，战无不胜”的英雄们，在修筑铁路上也表现了同样高贵的品质。
    另一支筑路力量是重庆市及西南各地的二万多失业工人，其中有重庆市收容的一千二百名游民乞丐；还有过去的土匪、流氓和旧军官兵。这些人初到工地，还调皮捣蛋，不愿好好地劳动；但经过军工干部的耐心教育，帮助他们学习政治，提高了阶级觉悟；许多染上不良嗜好的人，都改邪归正。一般工作效率从初期只有标准工百分之二十五，提高到百分之一百五十。有许多人已成为筑路功臣。工程大队有成百失业工人学会了铺轨的专门技术，成为铁路局正式职工。更有许多工人在养路训练班学习，在工地各种工作岗位上，逐渐成为骨干分子。
    今年，各地动员与组织了十万余民工，在成渝路全线上动工，工程进展很快，土方石方已完成了百分之五十以上。筑路民工在实际劳动中，已锻炼成为一支有组织的有纪律的雄壮的劳动大军。他们在短短的时间里，掌握了筑路技术，涌现出大批积极分子。这充分说明中国人民不仅是勤劳的，而且是聪明有才智的。
  （二）
    如何保证筑路器材的供应，是一个必须解决的重大问题。在国民党反动政府统治时代，修筑铁路的器材，完全依赖于资本主义国家，甚至一根枕木和一个道钉，也要从外国买来。人民政府采用了“群策群力，就地取材”的方针。这样，成渝铁路的修筑，使四川工商业及人民群众的生活发生了巨大的变化，尤其是带动了工商业的恢复与发展。就重庆来说，由于美帝国主义长期的经济侵略和蒋匪帮退却时的破坏，才解放时，有三分之二的矿厂经常停工，十多万工人没有工做。机器、钢铁等重工业基本陷于停顿。成渝铁路需要的大量机器、工具，复活了重庆的工业。国营经济带动了私营经济，人民政府以加工订货和贷放大批资金的办法，扶植私营工矿业的生产。像渝鑫钢铁厂，自从接受成渝铁路订货后，总厂和十个分厂大部恢复了生产，该厂经理李志亲说：“成渝路的修筑救活了工厂的生产力。现在我们不怕没有活做，而是接受了订货怕做不出来，工厂也从过去光吃资本，变为有利可图。”四百二十八家私营机器厂，几乎全部获得订货。铁业中的大型铁铺一百八十五家，也都接受了订货。由于钢铁、机器、铁作三业生产问题的解决，增加了炼铁的需要，推动了四川各地的土铁业的恢复与发展。在抗日战争期间，外铁不能进口，四川土铁工厂曾获得发展的机会，铁厂有二百多家，年产量达三、四万吨。西南各地兵工厂、钢铁厂，都以它作炼钢化铁的原料。抗战胜利后，美国铁源源进口，土铁业几乎全部停炉。为了建设成渝铁路，人民政府大力扶助铁业恢复生产，曾以先付货款的办法，向川北宣汉、万源地区、川南威远地区，川东綦江地区收购土铁数千吨，使上述三区恢复土铁工业近百家。四川水泥工业在解放前半年就停工了，工人每月只领三分之一工资的维持费。由于成渝铁路的订货及各厂矿生产的恢复，该业生产水泥已供不应求，生产量达到最高的纪录。由于工矿业和航运的恢复，煤业，砖瓦，电工器材、化工，五金商业等也随之发展起来，通过成渝铁路的建设投放市场的资金，为数甚大，连带商业也日益繁荣了。
    成渝铁路需要大量的枕木，在反动政府时代，这是不可能解决的。但经过西南财政经济委员会召集枕木会议后，结合生产救灾、救济失业工人等工作，有组织地动员成渝沿线数十万群众伐运枕木。广大群众对于修筑人民铁路的热情很高。全线共需要一百零八万五千多根枕木，在九个月中，铁路局已收到各地送来的枕木达八十二万五千根，今年铺轨已用不完了。通过采伐、运输枕木，结合农村的中心工作，发动与教育了农民群众。同时增加了农民的收入，活跃了农村经济，也使人民币深入到乡村中去。如叙永，古蔺等县缺少人民币，老百姓采用以物易物的办法，由于采购枕木，使一定数量人民币和工业品下乡，就初步转变了农村的贸易关系。
    成渝铁路对沿线城镇中小工业和商业的发展，有巨大的帮助。开山工程需要大量炸药原料，使永川等地停顿已久的硫磺业复苏起来。各地砖瓦厂、石灰厂也应需要而扩大生产。至于商业，内江一地在三个月前，就有二百五十家商店复业。川南区一九五一年民工获得的工资约有三亿斤大米，其他各项收入为数更多、失业工人大为减少，广大群众生活都有了出路。因筑路直接间接初步改善了生活的群众，仅川南的隆昌，内江等五县即达十五万人，各县石工几乎全部参加筑路工作，铁工、木工制作筑路所需工具、家具。妇女锤道碴石子，每天可得工资三升多米。
  （三）
    修筑成渝铁路的军工、农民、失业工人共有十余万，他们在一起劳动、生活和学习，好像是一所大规模的训练班。特别是在伟大的抗美援朝与土地改革运动中，他们受到了阶级教育和爱国主义教育，学习了一些文化知识，提高了思想觉悟，密切联系了驻地群众，也教育了群众，变成一支纪律良好，关心群众利益的队伍；他们回到各地农村中，就会成为农民的积极分子或下层干部，这在农村政治建设上也是一个大收获。
    另一方面，组织成渝铁路沿线群众参加护路工作，使广大农民参加抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命的高涨热情巩固起来了。由重庆到朱阳溪沿线，就组织了护路队员一万三千一百一十人，其中妇女占一半，并编制了大队、中队、分队、组。在防止坏人破坏、协助抢修坍方工程、保护新植树木及电信设备、警报危险避免机车出事、捕捉反革命分子等方面，都起了很大的作用。他们的口号是：“铁路铺轨到那里，群众护路队组织到那里，并订立护路爱国公约。”这样经常性的群众组织，不但对于保护铁路安全有很大的作用，而且对于地方治安，反特务防奸细也有很大的意义。同时通过护路队的组织，经常对群众进行政治的和文化的宣传教育。
  （四）
    将来成渝铁路通车后，对于四川农村经济的发展，城乡内外物资的交流，以及铁路沿线的经济建设，都有很大的作用。四川一向号称“天府之国”，成都盆地是四川的谷仓，有大量的粮食和丰富农产品，更有著名全国的自贡井盐和内江蔗糖，以及很多的土产品，特产品，药材等。由于没有现代交通设备，运输成本高，不能输出去。成渝铁路将使川西丰富的农产品、土产品、特产品，经长江航运与外地市场密切联系起来，大大增加人民的收入。同时为将来开发西康等地丰富资源创造有利条件，也是西南基本工业建设的起点。
