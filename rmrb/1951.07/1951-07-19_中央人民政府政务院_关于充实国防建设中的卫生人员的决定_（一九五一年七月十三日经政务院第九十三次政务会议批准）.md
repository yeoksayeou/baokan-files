　　Central People's Government State Council
　　Decision on Replenishing Health Personnel in National Defense Construction
　　(Approved by the 93rd Plenary Meeting of the State Council on July 13, 1951)
　　All officers and men of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have made unparalleled glorious and outstanding contributions in the long and arduous struggle to liberate the country and defend the territory. Their health and well-being must be fully guaranteed. Especially at present, in order to meet the needs of accelerating national defense construction and establishing a modern army, navy, and air force, we should vigorously replenish health personnel in national defense construction to strengthen military health work and improve the health level of all military members. While replenishing health personnel in national defense construction, we should also actively find ways to ensure that the health care work of the general public is not greatly affected. For this reason, the following decisions are made:
　　(1) People's governments at all levels, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations, especially health organizations and health trade unions, should actively call on local public health institutions and private practicing health personnel to enthusiastically participate in health work in national defense construction on a voluntary basis. This call must be combined with patriotic ideological education, and extensive and enthusiastic discussions should be carried out to make health personnel across the country deeply aware of the important significance of strengthening national defense construction and the correct orientation of health undertakings towards workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to confirm that participating in health work in national defense construction is a glorious task of defending the country and protecting the home. In carrying out this work, the tendency of coercion and commandism should be avoided and prevented.
　　(2) Public and private health personnel who voluntarily join the national defense forces should be given appropriate increases in their salaries and benefits, and their work achievements should be rewarded and commended. They should be given opportunities for further study during a certain period of service in the national defense forces to improve their professional level.
　　(3) After a portion of the health personnel in public health institutions participate in national defense construction, appropriate personnel supplements must be made to public health institutions. For this reason, private practicing health personnel should also be called upon to participate in the work of public health institutions on a voluntary basis, either full-time or part-time. At the same time, in order to ensure that the overall health care work of society is not affected, private practicing health personnel who cannot participate in national defense construction or public health institutions due to actual difficulties may be assisted by local health administrative organs as much as possible, on a voluntary basis, to participate in or organize joint public-private or private joint medical institutions so that they can exert greater work effectiveness. The specific methods will be formulated separately by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government.
　　(4) The work of graduates from public and private medical colleges and universities above the intermediate level across the country shall be properly and uniformly assigned by the government, and the needs of national defense construction shall be given priority in the assignment of work.

　　中央人民政府政务院
　  关于充实国防建设中的卫生人员的决定
　  （一九五一年七月十三日经政务院第九十三次政务会议批准）
    我人民解放军全体将士，在解放全国保卫国土的长期艰苦斗争中，有着无上光荣和卓越的功勋。对于他们的健康生活，必须予以充分的保障。尤其在目前为了适应加速国防建设、建立现代化的陆海空军的需要，更应大力充实国防建设中的卫生人员，以加强军队卫生工作，提高全体军队成员的健康水平。在充实国防建设中的卫生人员时，并应积极设法使一般人民中的保健工作不致受到大的影响。为此特作决定如下：
    （一）各级人民政府，各民主党派，各人民团体，尤其卫生团体与卫生工会应积极号召当地公立卫生机关中的及私人开业的卫生人员，在自愿的基础上，踊跃参加国防建设中的卫生工作。这种号召必须结合爱国主义的思想教育，广泛展开热烈讨论，使全国卫生人员深切认识加强国防建设的重要意义以及卫生事业面向工农兵的正确方针，确认参加国防建设中的卫生工作是卫国保家的光荣任务。在进行此项工作时，应避免和防止强迫命令的倾向。
    （二）公私卫生人员，其自愿参加国防军服务者，对于他们的薪金待遇应予以适当的提高，对于他们在工作上的成绩应予以奖励和表扬，在国防军服务一定时期应予以进修的机会，提高其业务水平。
    （三）公立卫生机关中的一部分卫生人员参加国防建设以后，对于公立卫生机关，必须作适当的人员补充，为此，并应号召私人开业的卫生人员，在自愿的基础上，以全部或一部分时间参加公立卫生机关的工作。同时为保证社会的整个保健工作不受影响，对于因实际困难不能参加国防建设或公立卫生机关的私人开业的卫生人员，可由各地卫生行政机关尽可能协助他们，在自愿的基础上，参加或组织公私联合的或私人联合的医疗机构，使他们能发挥更大的工作效能。其具体办法由中央人民政府卫生部另订之。
    （四）全国中级以上公私立医药院校毕业生的工作，应由政府妥为统一分配，在分配工作时，应首先照顾国防建设的需要。
