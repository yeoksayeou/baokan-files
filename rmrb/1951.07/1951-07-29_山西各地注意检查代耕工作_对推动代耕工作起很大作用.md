Shanxi Various Localities Pay Attention to Inspecting Substitute Tilling Work
    Plays a Great Role in Promoting Substitute Tilling Work
    This year, various localities in Shanxi have paid close attention to the inspection and specific guidance of substitute tilling work, which has played a significant role in promoting it.
    In April this year, the Wuxiang County People's Government transferred civil affairs cadres from the county and districts and organized three inspection teams to conduct key inspections of the substitute tilling work. Subsequently, in conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and the patriotic production competition movement, a county-wide general inspection of substitute tilling work was launched. The method of inspection: committees of preferential treatment were convened in each district and village, and representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the masses were invited to participate, organizing substitute tilling work inspection committees, going deep into the fields for inspection, discovering good and bad examples, and using blackboard newspapers, broadcasting tubes and other methods to carry out criticism and commendation. This method encouraged the good, promoted the backward, and made the substitute tilling work in the whole county generally improved. For example, in Jianzhang Village, due to the masses' recognition of the political significance of preferential treatment work, the substitute tilling work was done well, and it was commended during the inspection. The enthusiasm of the masses was even higher. When signing the contract for contracted farming, the substitute tilling households made guarantees to the families of martyrs and soldiers: they would work harder, apply more fertilizer, and improve technology to cultivate the land well, so that the production and life of the families of martyrs and soldiers would not be lower than the level of the general masses. Another example is Hujiazhuang Village, where the substitute tilling work was not done well in the past. The village cadres did not regard substitute tilling as an important matter, the land yield of the families of martyrs and soldiers was assessed very low, production preparations and action were very late, and manure was not delivered to the fields in time; therefore, the crops did not grow well. After the inspection team discovered this situation, they carried out political education for the village cadres and the masses, and criticized the village for neglecting substitute tilling work; the substitute tilling work in the village has been initially improved. This inspection also increased the enthusiasm of the families of soldiers to participate in production. For example, Wang Xuelian, a soldier's family member in Jianzhang Village, rarely participated in production in the past, but now she also participates in hoeing, hoeing more than three mu of land in three days. In the production competition, many soldier's family members have emerged as labor models. Many villages have also established a regular inspection system once a month through the inspection movement. Some villages and groups have stipulated a system of mutual inspection and mutual observation according to the seasons, and universally put wooden signs in the substitute tilled land, writing the names of the substitute tiller and the soldier's family member, so that the masses can be their judges at any time.

　　山西各地注意检查代耕工作
    对推动代耕工作起很大作用
    山西各地今年都很注意代耕工作的检查与具体指导，对推动代耕工作起了很大作用。
    武乡县人民政府在今年四月抽调县区民政干部，组织了三个检查组，对代耕工作进行重点检查。接着，又结合着抗美援朝宣传与爱国主义生产竞赛运动，展开了全县代耕工作的大检查。检查的办法：各区、村分别召开优抚委员会，并吸收烈军属、革命残废军人及群众的代表参加，组织代耕工作检查委员会，深入田间进行视察，发现好坏典型，采取黑板报、广播筒等方式进行批评表扬。这种方法，鼓励了好的，推动了落后的，使全县代耕工作普遍有了进步。如该县监漳村由于群众都认识优抚工作的政治意义，代耕工作做得比较好，在检查中受到了表扬，群众的情绪更高了，在订立包耕合同时，代耕户都向烈属、军属提出保证：要加工、加肥、提高技术，把地种好，使烈属、军属生产生活不低于一般群众水平。又如该县胡家庄过去代耕工作做得很不好。村干部就没有把代耕当成一回事，对烈属、军属的土地产量评得很低，生产准备与动手都很晚，粪也没有及时送到地里；因此，庄稼长得很不好。检查组发现这个情况后，向村干部和群众进行了政治教育，并对该村忽视代耕工作进行了批评；该村代耕工作已有了初步改进。这次检查又提高了军属参加生产的热情。如监漳村军属王雪连过去很少参加生产，现在也参加锄地，三天锄了三亩多地。该县在生产竞赛中，已经涌现出不少军属劳动模范。不少村庄通过检查运动还建立了每月一次的经常性的检查制度。有些村、组规定按季节互相检查、互相观摩的制度，并普遍在代耕地里插上木牌，写上代耕人与军属的名字，让群众随时作为他们的评判员。
