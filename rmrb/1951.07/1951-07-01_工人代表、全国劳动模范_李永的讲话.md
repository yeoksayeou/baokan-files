Comrades:

　　Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. On this great and glorious festival, we, the working class of the whole country, with boundless joy and excitement, extend our warm congratulations and highest respects to our great and wise leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee!

　　In these thirty years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class has fought a decisive battle with the three most vicious enemies of the Chinese people—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. After many twists and turns, we have joined the people of the whole country in victoriously overthrowing the rule of the reactionary forces, establishing a people's democratic republic led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and opening up a bright road towards socialism and communism. In these thirty years of struggle, tens of thousands of Communist Party members have gloriously sacrificed their lives for the cause of liberation of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. We would like to express our deep condolences and heartfelt gratitude to the revolutionary martyrs of the Party.

　　From its long years of struggle, the Chinese working class has learned a truth: the cause of liberation of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people can only be victorious under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao.

　　As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, we assure Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee: we will earnestly study the glorious history of struggle and the rich and valuable experience of struggle of the Communist Party of China, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, in order to continuously improve our class consciousness. We will humbly and practically study the advanced Soviet enterprise management experience and production technology, so as to continuously improve our own management ability and technical level. We will work hard to study culture, and strive to eliminate illiteracy among the working class as soon as possible, so that the Chinese working class can become a class with cultural accomplishments.

　　As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, we assure Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee: we will earnestly implement Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call to us: "Build a strong economic force." We enthusiastically respond to the three major calls of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea: to universally conclude patriotic pacts, to donate airplanes, artillery, and tanks on the basis of increased production, and to do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, strive for victory in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, consolidate the national defense of our great motherland, and defend peace in Asia and the world!

　　We will always follow the Communist Party! Always follow Chairman Mao! Strive to build a prosperous and happy new China and fight for a socialist future!

　　Workers of the whole country, unite, step up production, support the front, and consolidate national defense!

　　Oppose the U.S. aggressors and resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionaries!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Communist Party of China!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　工人代表、全国劳动模范  李永的讲话同志们：
    今天是中国共产党诞生的三十周年纪念日。我们全国工人在这个伟大光荣的节日，以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情，向我们伟大英明的领袖毛主席及党中央委员会致以热烈的祝贺与崇高的敬礼！
    在这三十年中，中国工人阶级在毛主席与中国共产党的领导之下，与中国人民的三个最凶恶的敌人——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义进行了决死的战斗。经历了许多的艰难曲折之后，我们已经和全国人民在一起，胜利地推翻了反动势力的统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主共和国，并且开辟了走向社会主义、共产主义的光明大道。在这三十年的斗争中，有成千上万的共产党员，为了中国工人阶级与中国人民的解放事业，光荣地牺牲了自己生命。我们谨向党的先烈致沉痛的哀悼与衷心的感谢。
    中国工人阶级从自己长期斗争的体验中，懂得了一条真理：中国工人阶级和全国人民的解放事业只有在以毛主席为首中国共产党的领导之下，才能获得胜利。
    在庆祝党的诞生的三十周年纪念日的时候，我们向毛主席及党中央保证：我们要认真地学习中国共产党的光荣的斗争历史与丰富的宝贵的斗争经验，学习马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想，以此来不断地提高我们的阶级觉悟。我们要虚心地结合实际地学习苏联的先进的企业管理经验和生产技术，借以不断地提高我们自己的管理能力与技术水平。我们要努力地学习文化，争取早日消灭工人阶级中的文盲，使中国工人阶级成为一个在文化上有素养的阶级。
    在庆祝党诞生的三十周年纪念日的时候，我们向毛主席和党中央保证：我们要切实执行毛主席和党中央对我们的号召：“建设强大的经济力量”。我们热烈地响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的三大号召：普遍订立爱国公约，在增产的基础上捐献飞机、大炮、坦克，作好优待烈属军属的工作，来支援中国人民志愿军，争取抗美援朝战争的胜利，巩固我们伟大祖国的国防，保卫亚洲和世界的和平！
    我们永远跟着共产党走！永远跟着毛主席走！为建立富强幸福的新中国，争取社会主义的前途而奋斗！
    全国工人阶级团结起来，加紧生产，支援前线，巩固国防！
    反对美国侵略者，坚决消灭一切反革命分子！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
