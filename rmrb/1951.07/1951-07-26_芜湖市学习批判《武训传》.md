Wuhu City Studies and Criticizes "The Life of Wu Xun"

The film "The Life of Wu Xun" was shown in Wuhu City for fourteen days in late February, with an audience of over 37,000 (approximately one-fifth of the city's population). Most of these viewers were deceived, and although some propaganda and cultural workers felt "it was not a good film" after seeing it, they did not further recognize its reactionary essence. It was not until the "People's Daily" called for criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" that it attracted the attention of local leading departments. The CPC Southern Anhui District Committee, the Wuhu Municipal Committee, the Southern Anhui Administrative Office's Department of Culture and Education, and the preparatory committee of the Southern Anhui District Federation of Literary and Art Circles all conducted research successively and arranged for the study of criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun."

After this stage of study, the ideological level of both Party and non-Party cadres has been raised a step. The following are some gains from the study:

(1) Many people have initially understood that when evaluating historical figures, a clear line should be drawn between revolution and counter-revolution. Evaluation should be based on the promoting or hindering effect they had on historical development, should measure historical figures from the perspective of the people, and should test motives based on practical results. Based on this standard, Wu Xun was measured, allowing people to recognize the essence of Wu Xun. Wu Xun's "running schools" was to maintain feudal rule, and his "thirty years as one day" of "ascetic spirit" was as shameful as "Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's desperate struggle for the anti-communist and anti-people 'cause'."

(2) Many people have initially realized that culture and art serve politics and have class character. If it is not clear "who education serves," then the fact that "the United States has established many schools in China," as Austin said, would also be considered good. At the same time, it is recognized that a purely technical view of artistic creation is incorrect, and all artistic creation should start from the broad political content of "serving the people."

(3) Because the above issues have been clarified, many people have further cleared out their old ideas and old consciousness. Many new cadres criticized their own erroneous ideas such as "enduring hardship to become a superior person," "studying is for being looked up to," and "wealth or poverty is determined by literacy or illiteracy." Many professors and teachers criticized their past supra-class and supra-political reformist ideas. Some professors and teachers even openly reviewed their loss of position due to the influence of Wu Xun and made behaviors similar to Wu Xun.

Although this stage of study has achieved some results, it is not yet widespread. Some agency cadres and cultural and educational workers have not yet conducted discussions. Some cadres believe: "I didn't know Wu Xun in the past, and I haven't seen the movie, so there is no need to participate in the discussion," and even the articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun" have not been read carefully. Even cadres who have participated in the discussion still do not have a deep understanding. For example, some people feel that "it makes sense to read articles criticizing Wu Xun, but it also makes sense to read articles praising Wu Xun or defending Wu Xun." In response to this situation, the local authorities are preparing to continue the work of criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun" after the study of suppressing counter-revolutionaries comes to an end.

### 芜湖市学习批判《武训传》

    芜湖市学习批判《武训传》
    电影《武训传》于二月底在芜湖市放映了十四天，观众达三万七千多人（约占全市人口的五分之一）这些观众的大部分都被迷惑住了，一部分宣传工作者及文教工作者虽然看过后感到“不是一部好影片”，但也没有进一步地认识到它的反动本质。自《人民日报》号召批判《武训传》后，才引起当地领导部门的注意。中共皖南区党委、芜湖市委、皖南行署文教处、皖南区文学艺术界联合会筹备委员会等，均先后进行过研究，布置了批判《武训传》的学习。
    经过这一阶段的学习，使党与非党干部的思想水平都提高了一步，下面就是学习中的几点收获：
    （一）许多人初步懂得了鉴定历史人物时应划清革命与反革命的界限，应从其对历史发展所起的推动或阻碍作用来加以鉴定，应从人民的立场来衡量历史人物，应从实践效果来检验动机。并根据这种标准来衡量武训，使人们都认识武训的本质，武训的“兴学”是为了维护封建统治，他那“三十年如一日”的“苦行精神”正如“蒋介石匪帮，为反共反人民‘事业’而作的垂死挣扎”一样的可耻。
    （二）使许多人初步认识到文化艺术是为政治服务，是有阶级性的。如果不弄清“教育为谁服务”，则对于奥斯汀所说的“美国在中国办了不少学校”，也会认为是好的。同时也认识到艺术创作上的单纯技术观点是不对的，一切艺术创作均应以“为人民服务”这一广阔的政治内容为出发点。
    （三）由于弄清了以上的问题，许多人进一步地对自己的旧思想、旧意识进行了清算。不少新干部批判了自己的“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人”“读书就是为了被人瞧得起”，“穷与富要由识字与不识字来决定”等等错误思想。不少教授、教员批判了自己过去的超阶级、超政治的改良主义思想。有些教授、教员们还公开检讨了由于武训的影响而做出和武训一样的有失立场的行为。
    这一阶段的学习，虽然获得了一些成绩，但还不普遍。有些机关干部和文教工作者还没有进行过讨论。有些干部认为：“我过去既不知道武训其人，又没有看过电影，所以用不着参加讨论”，甚至连批判《武训传》的文章也没有好好看过。就是参加过讨论的干部，认识也还是不深刻。如有些人感到“看批判武训的文章是有道理，但是看歌颂武训或者为武训辩护的文章也有道理。”针对这种情况，当地有关部门准备在镇压反革命的学习告一段落后，再继续开展批判《武训传》的工作。
