　　The CCP Pingyuan Province Huojia County Committee
    Examines the Tendency of Ignoring Politics
    Zhou Bo Bao Ying
    Editor's note: The examination by the CCP Pingyuan Province Huojia County Committee proves that the tendency of some leading organs and some leading cadres to only focus on professional work and ignore politics is serious. We believe that this tendency must be resolutely corrected. It should be pointed out that the primary task of leading organs is to conduct political leadership; leading cadres must see themselves as political workers. Therefore, the Party's leading organs in various localities must constantly wage a serious struggle against the corrupt and liberalist tendency of ignoring politics.
    The "tendency of only managing professional work and not asking about politics" also seriously exists in some county-level leading organs and county and district cadres in Huojia County. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement has been vigorously launched throughout the country, and various places are drafting patriotic pacts, but most of the directly affiliated organs in Huojia County have not drafted patriotic pacts, fully demonstrating their indifference to politics. Some comrades mistakenly believe that "Resisting America and Aiding Korea is a matter for the masses. It's enough for me to work a few hours a day." When celebrating the liberation of Seoul, many comrades were afraid of the trip and didn't participate; when donating airplanes and cannons, they used the excuse of the supply system not to donate. In particular, comrades in the economic departments believe that "Resisting America and Aiding Korea is a matter for the Party Committee's Propaganda Department and the Cultural and Education Department. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a matter for the Public Security Department." They rarely listen to or dislike listening to reports on these matters. Their reason is "We can't stop doing business," and "Whether we listen or not, we won't do it anyway." Cadres engaged in economic work go to the countryside not to complete tasks through the central work, but simply to do professional work. They usually rarely read newspapers, or only look at the headlines. This not only shows "thin political air and low principles," but also some cadres are beginning to decline politically and are tired of their work. Some county and district cadres say, "This movement comes, that movement goes, the revolution never ends." Individual cadres, because of heavy work tasks, cannot go home, and do not work properly. On the other hand, some cadres are indifferent to the high patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. For example, the masses in the Third District went to the district several times to hand in donations, and the secretary of the Third District government believed that "it's not my responsibility" and refused to receive them. The masses reflected, "Everyone is resisting America and aiding Korea, but the Third District government is not resisting America and aiding Korea." In terms of the county's work of plowing on behalf of soldiers' families, most of it has not implemented a contract labor system. This year, the county obtained 100,000 work tickets for plowing on behalf of soldiers' families, and now more than 70,000 have not been claimed. However, our cadres are blind to these phenomena or do not care enough. Some organs' Party members do not have organizational life for one or two months, nor do they study the basic knowledge of the Party.
    After preliminary examination and analysis of the above situation, the CCP Huojia County Committee believes that the instruction of the CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee to oppose the tendency of not asking about politics is completely correct and suits the situation of Huojia County. Therefore, it issued a notice requiring Party committees at all levels, Party members and cadres in various departments to seriously study the two circulars of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee on "Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics" and "Opposing Commandism," to discuss them in light of reality, to examine themselves in light of themselves, and to determine future improvement methods. At the same time, the Huojia County Committee launched a political study movement on the occasion of commemorating "July 1" (the main content was Party history and "July 1" commemorative essays) in order to improve the political level of cadres. Secondly, a general political test was held.
    On June 22 and 27, political tests and homework exhibitions were held successively among机关干部 and district cadres. The results of this test proved that the "tendency of not asking about politics" is quite serious.
    A total of 217 cadres participated in the test, with a total average score of 37.4. 133 county-level机关干部 had an average score of 33.9. 84 district cadres had an average score of 41. Of the five questions in this test, only 27 people passed, accounting for 12.5 percent, and 190 people failed, accounting for 87.5 percent of the total number of people. No organ in the county had an average score above 60, and the average score of cadres in the County Committee organs was the highest, but it was only 47.3; the Liquor and Monopoly Bureau had the lowest, averaging 8 points. The Third District was better in the district, averaging 47.25 points. The economic departments were the worst, with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative averaging 29.9 points. The bank had 28.2 points. The post office had 22.3 points.
    Judging from the answers, many comrades not only did not understand, but also had many wrong answers:
    In terms of national affairs and current affairs, many comrades could not answer what the "three major calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea" were; some answered "production, resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries." Some answered "river management, cotton planting, strengthening political study, and conducting extensive publicity." Most comrades could not answer or fully answer "the significance of promoting patriotic pacts," and those who only got two or three points accounted for more than half of the participants in the test. What is particularly wrong is that some answered: "Protect human rights, land rights, and property rights." Reducing the action program of loving the motherland under high awareness to the level of protecting private property. No wonder there is a tendency of formalism in Huojia's drafting of patriotic pacts.
    In terms of policies, "Who are the counter-revolutionaries?" Some answered "American imperialism," and some answered "landlords, rich peasants, and riffraff." Even people in the public security and judicial departments could not say, answering "habitual thieves, hooligans, and enemy and puppet personnel above the regimental commander." No one could clearly state the comprehensive policy of handling counter-revolutionaries that combines suppression and leniency; instead, they answered: "Resist America and aid Korea," or "Strive to disintegrate and disintegrate the enemy." Or answer "kill, imprison." It should be particularly alarming that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has been going on for more than half a year, but many cadres are still so confused about the policy boundaries. This is dangerous and should be corrected quickly.
    On the issue of "The Life of Wu Xun," regarding the question of "What is the essence of the Wu Xun spirit, should it be praised or criticized," some comrades answered: "Although Wu Xun served the ruling class, he could not read a word, but he could run schools and do such a great cause, which should be praised." "Wu Xun's spirit of hard work can be learned." This extremely wrong understanding and thinking is due to the fact that some comrades do not understand Wu Xun's person and deeds, or only have a smattering of knowledge; but other comrades have not yet stood on the side of the people, and the reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie are still seriously invading them. The "Wu Xun issue," which has been commented on in newspapers for more than a month, has not yet aroused the attention and study of these comrades, which shows how serious the tendency of not asking about politics is.
    Regarding the basic knowledge of the Party. Many comrades do not understand what kind of party the Communist Party is, and even individual district committees actually answered that the nature of the Communist Party is "the nature of the coalition government." Some simply answered "The Communist Party dares to take the lead in things that no one dares to do." Some Party members lowered the requirements for Party members to the requirements of a farmers' association member, thinking that "being loyal and reliable, upright, not greedy, and not corrupt" is enough to join the Party. This fully shows that these Communist Party members, as the vanguard of the proletariat, are very poor in studying the Party Constitution.
    Regarding the question of "What is the spirit of the circular on 'Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics,'" many comrades had not read the newspaper at all. For example, of the 23 people who participated in the test from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, 14 did not answer. Of the 15 people in the Public Security Bureau, 14 had not read it. Only one person got three points (full score was 20 points). Of the 11 people in the Tax Bureau, 7 did not answer. Those who answered in general terms were "emphasizing business, not caring about politics, lacking political interest" and "the tendency of only managing business and not asking about politics." One person answered "Resist America and defend the country."
    After the test, the comrades reviewed that the reasons for not studying well were: 1. The leadership's emphasis on political study was poor, and the comrades' thinking was "If the work is not done well, someone will criticize it, but no one will ask if you don't read the newspaper." Even if some leading comrades paid attention to the political study of cadres, it was limited to general appeals, lacking regular supervision and inspection, and had never been tested like this before. 2. The cadres themselves did not attach importance to study, emphasizing that they were busy with work and had no time. Before the establishment of vocational schools, there was an emphasis on politics over culture, but now there is a tendency to emphasize culture over politics. Many comrades said, "You can't get by without culture." They don't understand enough that culture serves politics. Therefore, they don't read newspapers or read less, or only look at the headlines. Reading books starts from interest and from business, without considering the long-term political direction. 3. There is a lack of study materials, and there is a fear of losing face. They are afraid of losing "status" and lack the spirit of "not being ashamed to ask."
    After the test, the enthusiasm for learning was directly promoted. Many comrades found that the fundamental reason why their work had not been good in the past and their personal progress was slow was that they did not study politics. Therefore, many comrades said, "It's not okay not to study!" "If you don't understand the requirements for Party members, how can you be a district committee member?!" "If you don't study anymore, you won't be able to work. You will become a political mediocrity who catches sparrows with your eyes closed, fishes blindly, is crude and superficial, and talks nonsense." After many comrades attached importance to political study in their thinking, they all signed patriotic pacts. At the expanded cadres' meeting, 32 cadres from the Third and Fifth Districts signed patriotic pacts. (Pingyuan Daily)

　　中共平原省获嘉县委
    检查不问政治的倾向
    周波　保英
    编者按：中共平原省获嘉县委的检查，证明某些领导机关、某些领导干部只钻研业务、不问政治的倾向是严重的。我们认为对于这种倾向，必须坚决加以纠正。应该指出：领导机关的首要任务就是进行政治领导；领导干部必须把自己看作是一个政治工作者。因此，各地党的领导机关必须经常对于不问政治的腐朽的自由主义倾向进行严肃的斗争。
    “只管业务不问政治的倾向”，在获嘉县一部分县级领导机关和县区干部中，同样严重地存在着。抗美援朝运动已在全国轰轰烈烈地开展，各地都在订爱国公约，而获嘉县直属机关绝大部分未订立爱国公约，充分表现了对政治的冷淡。有的同志错误地认为“抗美援朝是群众的事，我每天办几个钟头公就算了事。”举行庆祝汉城解放大会时，有很多同志怕跑路不去参加；捐献飞机大炮时借口供给制不捐献。尤其是经济部门的同志，他们认为“抗美援朝是党委宣传部和文化教育部门的事。镇压反革命是公安部门的事。”对于这方面的报告，他们很少听或不喜欢听。他们的理由是“不能停止营业”，“听不听咱也不作那”。作经济工作的干部下乡工作，不是通过中心工作来完成任务，而是单纯地作业务工作。他们平时很少看报纸，或只看大标题。这不仅表现“政治空气稀薄，原则性不高”，而且有些干部在政治上开始走下坡路，厌烦自己的工作。有些县区干部这样说：“这个运动下，那个运动上，革命没个头。”有个别干部因工作任务繁重，回不了家，而不好好工作。另一方面，有些干部对于群众爱国热情的高涨，则淡然处之，如三区群众曾数次到区交捐献款，三区区政府秘书认为“不属我管”，拒绝接收。群众反映：“大家抗美援朝，三区政府不抗美援朝。”在全县代耕工作方面，多半未实行包工包产制。今年全县得十万份工票代耕，现还有七万多份未领走。而我们的干部同志对这些现象却熟视无睹，或者关心不够。有些机关的党员一两个月不过组织生活，也不学习有关党的基本知识。
    中共获嘉县委在初步检查与分析上述情况后，认为中共新乡地委反对不问政治倾向的指示是完全正确的，恰合获嘉县情况。因此发出通知，要各级党委、各部门党员、干部，认真地学习新乡地委关于“反对不问政治倾向”和“反对命令主义”的两个通报，联系实际进行讨论，联系自己进行检查，确定今后改善办法。与此同时，获嘉县委曾在纪念“七一”时，开展了一个政治学习运动（主要内容为党史和“七一”纪念论文），借以提高干部的政治水平。其次，举行一次普遍的政治测验。
    六月二十二日和二十七日，先后在机关干部和区干部中举行了政治测验和作业展览。这次测验的结果，证明“不问政治的倾向”是相当严重的。
    此次参加测验的干部共二百一十七人，总平均分数是三十七·四分。县级机关干部一百三十三人，平均分数三十三·九分。区干部八十四人，平均分数四十一分。此次测验共五题，及格者只二十七人，占百分之十二点五，不及格者一百九十人，占总人数的百分之八十七点五。全县没有一个机关平均在六十分以上的，县委会机关干部的平均分数最多，但也只有四十七·三分；酒业专卖处最少，平均八分。区以三区较好，平均四十七·二五分。经济部门最差，供销社平均二十九·九分。银行二十八·二分。邮局二十二·三分。
    从答案中看，不少同志不但不懂，而且还有不少错误的答案：
    在国家大事和时事方面，对“抗美援朝总会三大号召”是什么，不少同志答不上来；有的答成“生产、抗美援朝、镇压反革命。”有的答成“治河、植棉、加强政治学习，进行广泛宣传。”对“推行爱国公约的意义”，大部分同志答不上来或答不全，只得二、三分的占参加测验人数的一半以上。特别错误的是有的答成：“保障人权、地权、财权。”把在高度觉悟下热爱祖国的行动纲领，降低到保护私人财产的水平。无怪乎获嘉订立爱国公约存在着形式主义的偏向。
    在政策方面，对“哪些是反革命分子。”有的答是“美帝国主义”，有的答是“地主、富农、二流子。”甚至公安司法部门也有人说不上来，答为“惯偷、流氓、连团长以上的敌伪人员。”对处理反革命分子的全面政策，也没有人能够把镇压与宽大相结合的政策说清楚；而答为：“抗美援朝”，或答为“争取分化瓦解敌人”。或答为“杀、关”。应特别引起警惕的是镇压反革命工作已进行了半年多，可是还有许多干部对政策界限还这样糊涂。这是危险的，应迅速设法纠正。
    在武训传问题上，对“武训精神的实质是什么，应该歌颂或应该批判”一题，部分同志的答案是“武训虽为统治阶级服务，而他一字不识，能办学校，做出这样伟大的事业，是应歌颂的。”“武训的艰苦精神可以学习”。这种极端错误的认识与思想，一部分同志是由于对武训其人其事不了解、或一知半解；但另一部分同志则是由于立场尚未站到人民方面来，资产阶级的反动思想还严重的侵袭着他们。报纸已评论月余的“武训问题”，还未引起这些同志的注意和学习讨论，可见不问政治的倾向严重到什么程度。
    关于党的基本知识。不少同志不了解共产党是个什么样的政党，甚至个别区委竟把共产党的性质答成“联合政府的性质”。有的只简单答成“共产党，是没人敢干的事，它敢带头去干。”有的党员把党员条件降低到一个农会会员的条件，以为“忠实可靠，为人正派，不贪污，不腐化”就可以入党。这充分地说明这些作为无产阶级先锋队的共产党员对党章的学习是很差的。
    “对‘反对不问政治倾向’的通报精神是什么”一题，不少同志根本没看过报纸。如供销社参加测验的二十三人中，有十四人没答。公安局十五人中有十四人没看过。只有一人得了三分（足分为二十分）。税局十一人中，有七人未答。答的笼统的是“强调业务，对政治不关心，缺乏政治兴趣”、“只管业务不问政治的倾向”。有一个人答的是“抗美援朝保家卫国”。
    经过测验，同志们检讨到没好好学习的原因是：一、领导上重视学习政治差，同志们的想法是“工作作不好，有人批评，不看报没人过问。”即使有些领导同志注意了干部的政治学习，但只限于一般号召，缺乏经常的督促检查，从来没像这样测验过一次。二、干部本身对学习不重视，强调工作忙，没时间。业余学校成立前是重政治轻文化，现在却有些重文化轻政治的偏向。不少同志说“没文化吃不开。”对文化是为政治服务理解不够。因而不看报或少看，或只看大标题。看书是从兴趣出发从业务出发，而未考虑远大的政治方向。三、学习材料缺乏，且存在怕丢人思想。怕丢“身份”，缺乏“不耻下问”的精神。
    经过测验，直接推动了学习热忱，许多同志找到了过去工作不好、个人进步慢的根本原因是不学习政治。因此许多同志表示“不学习可不行啦！”“不了解党员条件，怎么当个区委！？”“再不学习工作也作不了了。将会变成一个闭眼捉麻雀，瞎子摸鱼，粗枝大叶，夸夸其谈的政治上的庸人。”许多同志在思想上重视了政治学习后，都纷纷订立爱国公约，在扩大干部会上就有三、五区三十二个干部订了爱国公约。（平原日报）
