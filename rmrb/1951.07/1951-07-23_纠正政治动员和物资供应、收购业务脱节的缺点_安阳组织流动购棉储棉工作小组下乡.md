　  Correcting the shortcomings of the separation of political mobilization from materials supply and purchasing operations
　  Anyang organizes mobile cotton purchasing and storage work teams to go to the countryside
    The contradiction between selling cotton and production is resolved, and the cotton purchasing work is rapidly launched.
    The Anyang County People's Government of Pingyuan Province corrected the shortcomings of the separation of political mobilization from purchasing operations in the cotton purchasing work, and the cotton purchasing work was rapidly launched. At the beginning of July, the Anyang County People's Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspected the cotton purchasing work and found that the ten cotton collection stations jointly formed by economic departments such as the supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies only handled cotton purchasing and storage procedures and materials supply, while the district and township people's governments and the Communist Party committees only did political mobilization work. The two sides were disconnected, and as a result, very little cotton was purchased.
    In order to improve this situation, the Anyang County People's Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party quickly adjusted the original cotton collection organization, and compiled the cotton collection staff into a number of mobile cotton purchasing and storage work teams. Carrying grain coupons, coal coupons, savings certificates, and cash, they went deep into the villages to carry out purchases, under the unified leadership of the district cotton purchasing and storage committees. The district cotton purchasing committee arranged for the mobile teams to go to the villages to collect cotton according to the political mobilization situation in each village. In this way, the political mobilization of cotton farmers was combined with the supply of materials and the handling of purchasing procedures, and the cotton purchasing work was rapidly launched. According to the statistics of eleven cotton collection teams, more than 126,300 catties of ginned cotton were purchased in the four days from July 9th to 12th.
    The mobile teams going to the countryside also solved the contradiction between cotton farmers selling cotton and production. Before the mobile teams went to the countryside, cotton farmers were afraid of deviations in grades or scales, and even ten or eight catties of cotton had to be personally rushed to the cotton collection station to sell, wasting a lot of time; many cotton farmers were even too busy with production to take care of selling cotton. The teams went to the villages to collect cotton mostly during the lunch break and evening rest time of the farmers, and provided convenience to the cotton farmers in all aspects. According to the statistics of ten mobile teams, more than 2,000 workdays were saved for cotton farmers in four days.

### 纠正政治动员和物资供应、收购业务脱节的缺点  安阳组织流动购棉储棉工作小组下乡

　  纠正政治动员和物资供应、收购业务脱节的缺点
　  安阳组织流动购棉储棉工作小组下乡
    解决了售棉和生产的矛盾，购棉工作迅速展开。
    平原省安阳县人民政府纠正购棉工作中政治动员和收购业务脱节的缺点，购棉工作迅速开展。安阳县人民政府和中共县委会七月初检查购棉工作，发现该县供销合作社和国营花纱布公司等经济部门联合组成的十个收棉站，只办理购棉储棉手续和物资供应，区、乡人民政府和中共党委只做政治动员工作，两头脱节，结果购棉很少。
    安阳县人民政府和中共县委会为了改善这一情况，迅速调整了原有收棉机构，把收棉工作人员编为若干流动购棉储棉工作小组，携带粮票、煤票、储蓄证、现款，深入各村进行收购，由各区购棉储棉委员会统一领导。区购棉委员会按各村政治动员情况，安排各流动小组去各村收棉。这样便把对棉农的政治动员和物资供应、办理收购手续结合起来，购棉工作因而迅速展开。据十一个收棉小组统计，七月九日到十二日四天内就收购皮棉十二万六千三百多斤。
    流动小组下乡也同时解决了棉农售棉和生产的矛盾。流动小组下乡前，棉农怕等级或秤头上出偏差，连十斤、八斤棉花都要亲自赶到收棉站来卖，浪费很多时间；不少棉农更因忙于生产而顾不上售棉。小组到各村收棉多在中午、晚上农民休息时间，并从各方面给棉农方便。据十个流动小组的统计，在四天中就节省了棉农两千多个工作日。
