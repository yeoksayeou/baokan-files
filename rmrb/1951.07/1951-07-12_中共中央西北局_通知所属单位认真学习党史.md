　　CCP Central Northwest Bureau
    Notice to Subordinate Units to Conscientiously Study Party History
    The CCP Central Northwest Bureau issued a notice on July 2 regarding the study of in-service cadres in the Northwest region, the content of which is as follows: 1. Within July, all departments should conscientiously lead cadres at all levels in conducting a preliminary study of the Party's history of struggle, laying a preliminary foundation for further study of Party history and Comrade Mao Zedong's various works in the future. Senior-level cadres should study Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Beijing celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Party's founding, Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," Comrade Chen Boda's "Mao Zedong Thought is the Integration of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese Revolution," Comrade Lu Dingyi's "The World Significance of the Chinese Revolution," Comrade Xi Zhongxun's "Following Mao Zedong Means Victory," and articles by other responsible comrades of the Central Committee; general cadres should mainly study Comrade Qiaomu's article, and also refer to other documents (not necessarily all to be read). The study method should be mainly self-study, and several reports and prepared discussions on Party history should be organized. When studying the concise history of the Party, it is necessary to conduct ideological education in light of the ideological situation of cadres in various regions, and seriously criticize and correct tendencies such as empiricism in ideological methods and bureaucratism and commandism in work, as well as complacency. 2. After the preliminary study of Party history is completed, from August onwards, senior-level cadres should continue to proceed as usual according to their original study plans; middle-level cadres can study "The Foundations of Leninism" or other readings; if local areas have not pre-determined a study plan for junior-level cadres, they can begin studying the "Reader of Political Common Sense" ("Elementary Edition"). 3. Comprehensive examinations for cadres at all levels will be held starting in November, and the results of this test will be used to adjust levels and finally determine grading, in order to prepare conditions for systematic theoretical study by the entire Party next year.

　　中共中央西北局
    通知所属单位认真学习党史
    中共中央西北局于七月二日发出关于西北区在职干部学习的通知，其内容如下：一、在七月份内，各处都应当很认真地领导各级干部对党的斗争历史，作一次初步的学习，给以后进一步学习党史及毛泽东同志的各种著作打下初步的基础。高级程度的干部，学习刘少奇同志在北京庆祝党成立三十周年纪念大会上的讲话、胡乔木同志所作的《中国共产党的三十年》、陈伯达同志所作的《毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义与中国革命的结合》、陆定一同志所写的《中国革命的世界意义》、习仲勋同志的《跟着毛泽东走就是胜利》，以及中央各负责同志的文章；一般干部只应以学习乔木同志的文章为主，再参阅其他文件（不一定要全部读完）。学习方法以自学为主，且应组织几次有关党史的报告和有准备的讨论。在学习党的简要历史时，一定要针对各地干部思想情况去进行思想教育，严肃地批判与纠正思想方法上的经验主义与工作上的官僚主义、命令主义，以及居功自满情绪等倾向。二、党史初步学习结束后，从八月份起，高级程度的干部，仍按自己原定的学习计划，照常进行；中级程度的干部，可以学习一本《论列宁主义基础》，或是别的读物；初级程度的干部，当地如未预定学习计划，即可开始学习政治常识读本（《学习初级版》）。三、十一月开始举行各级干部的全面考试，并以这次测验的结果调整程度，最后确定编级，为明年全党有系统地理论学习准备好条件。
