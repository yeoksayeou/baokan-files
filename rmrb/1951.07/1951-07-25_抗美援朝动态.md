Resist America, Aid Korea: News

The People of the Whole Country Have Pledged to Donate More Than 2,200 Airplanes

As of July 23, according to incomplete statistics, the people of various regions have pledged and initiated donations for 2,253 airplanes. In addition, there are 130 artillery pieces, 60 anti-aircraft guns, and 10 tanks. The numbers of various weapons pledged and initiated for donation in each region are as follows:

Region	Airplanes	Artillery	Anti-Aircraft Guns	Tanks
East China	821	34	15	3
Central South	569	15	10	3
Northeast	275	7	5	0
North China	260	49	14	2
Southwest	161	12	9	1
Northwest	108	9	7	1
Inner Mongolia	12	3	0	0
Individual Units	47	1	0	0
Total	2253	130	60	10

Note: The figures for the national people's pledges of weapons published in this column are based on statistics from newspapers and other materials received by the Secretariat of this Association on that day. Therefore, these statistics are still incomplete. For example, the 25th issue of this publication on July 4 stated that the East China region had pledged 489 airplanes as of July 3, while a Xinhua News Agency Shanghai dispatch on the 3rd reported that the East China region had pledged more than 740 airplanes as of July 1 (this news was published on the front page of the People's Daily on the same day). This difference in numbers is due to the different speeds at which this Association and Xinhua News Agency received the same type of materials. In some cases, this Association has gradually corrected this based on Xinhua News Agency materials and other materials, and in other cases, corrections are pending the receipt of new materials from various regions. This is hereby clarified.

Great Progress Has Been Made in Preferential Treatment Work in Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Other Places

In the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaodong, and the city of Changchun, the work of preferential treatment has generally improved compared to last year due to the leadership's close attention and the increased political awareness of the masses. In order to ensure that the land of the families of the volunteer army stretcher-bearer laborers who lack labor is well cultivated, most of Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces have implemented contract farming. Those with insufficient labor are provided with assistance in cultivation. Guanjia Village in the second district of Xi'an, Liaodong, has assigned dedicated substitute farming households for the land of 25 volunteer laborer families based on their specific circumstances. Generally, the counties have applied fertilizer to the land of volunteer laborers. In the past six months, Changchun City has introduced 71 honorary veterans and more than 240 families of martyrs and soldiers to employment, and has also provided loans of more than 59.7 million yuan to organize families of martyrs and soldiers to participate in production. Material subsidies are provided to families of martyrs and soldiers who lack labor and have difficulties in life. In the past six months, nearly 100,000 catties of subsidized grain and more than 4.5 million yuan in living subsidies have been distributed. At the same time, due consideration has been given to the medical treatment of families of martyrs and soldiers and the education of children of families of martyrs and soldiers. However, some cadres and masses in some areas of Heilongjiang still do not pay enough attention to the work of preferential treatment. For example, Zhao Hanting, a soldier's family member in Jianshe Village, Sixth District, Zhenlai County, went to the village cadres for help because he lacked a plow, but the village cadres not only did not help him find a solution, but instead said, "If I don't have one, can I buy one for you?" In Xingliang Village, Tai'an, some substitute-cultivated land has not been fertilized for three years, and the substitute-cultivation team in Minli Village weeded the land of volunteer laborer families very carelessly. The leadership organs in the Northeast have paid attention to correcting these shortcomings.

  全国人民认捐飞机已超过二千二百架
    截至七月二十三日为止，据不完全统计，各地人民认捐和发起捐献的飞机已经有二千二百五十三架。此外还有大炮一百三十门，高射炮六十门，坦克十辆。各地区认捐及发起捐献的各类武器数字如下：
    地区    飞机（架）   大炮（门）  高射炮（门）  坦克（辆）
    华东      八二一        三四  一五      三

    说明：本栏前后所登载的全国人民认捐武器数字，系根据本会秘书处当日已收到的报纸和其他材料统计的。因此，这些统计数字还是不完全的，例如七月四日本刊第二十五期所载华东区截至三日止已认捐飞机四百八十九架，而新华社上海三日电则报道华东区截至七月一日止已认捐飞机七百四十多架（这一消息载同日人民日报第一版），这一数字的不同，是因本会收到华东材料和新华社收到同一类材料的时间快慢不一所造成的。这种情形，有的本会已根据新华社材料和其他材料陆续补正，有的尚待收到各地新材料后补正。特此说明。
  黑龙江、松江等地的优抚工作有很大进步
    东北黑龙江、松江、辽东等省和长春市的优抚工作，由于领导上抓得紧和群众的政治觉悟提高，一般比去年都有了进步。黑龙江、松江两省为了保证把缺乏劳动力的志愿军担架队民工家属的土地种好，大部分实行了包耕。对劳动力不足的予以助耕。辽东西安第二区管家村把二十五户志愿民工家属的土地，都按具体情况确定了专责代耕户。各县一般都给志愿民工的土地上了粪。长春市半年来，已介绍七十一名荣誉军人和二百四十余名烈、军属就业，还贷款五千九百七十多万元，组织烈、军属参加生产。对劳动力缺乏、生活困难的烈、军属，发给实物补助。半年中，共发出近十万斤补助粮，四百五十多万生活补助费。同时，对烈、军属治病，烈、军属子弟求学都给予了应有的照顾。但黑龙江部分地区少数干部和群众对优抚工作还不够重视。如镇赍县六区建设村军属赵汉廷因缺犁杖去找村干部帮助解决，村干部不但不帮助想办法，反而说：“我没有还能给你买去吗？”泰安兴良村有的代耕地三年没上粪了，民力村代耕组给志愿民工家属铲趟很毛草。对于这些缺点，东北领导机关已注意纠正。
