Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Rangoon dispatch: American imperialism is plotting to use the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops who fled into Burma to invade our border. According to the Rangoon English-language "Daily Gazette" on June 8th, 14 U.S. Army officers are commanding the remnants of Chiang's bandits on Burma's eastern border. It also stated that paratroopers of "unclear origin" recently landed at Mong Hsat airport, 70 miles from Kengtung. The Burmese "Sun" newspaper also reported on June 15th that about 30 U.S. military officers were leading Chiang's bandit army to establish a "military base" on the northeast Burma-China border.

The activities of American imperialism among the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army fleeing to Burma have been going on for a long time. In August last year, the Indonesian "People's Daily" revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army fleeing to Burma was under the command of the U.S. 101st spy group, with its headquarters in Bangkok. Two U.S. spies were sent secretly to Kengtung to convene a meeting of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army leaders. Since January of this year, the United States has been actively supplying the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army fleeing to Burma with military supplies.

　  阴谋侵扰我国边境
    【新华社二十日讯】仰光消息：美帝国主义正在阴谋利用逃入缅甸的蒋介石匪军残部侵扰我国边境。据仰光英文每日公报六月八日载称：美国陆军军官十四名正在指挥缅甸东部边境的蒋匪残部。又说：最近有“来路不明”的伞兵在距景栋七十英里的曼塞（Mong Hsat）机场降落。缅文太阳报六月十五日也报道说：美国军官约三十名领导蒋匪军在缅甸东北部中缅边界建立“军事基地”。
    美国帝国主义在逃缅蒋匪军残部中的活动，进行已久。去年八月间，印尼民报即曾揭露：逃缅蒋匪军系受美国第一○一组间谍指挥，指挥部设在曼谷，曾派美国间谍两名秘密潜往景栋召集蒋匪军首领开会。从今年一月起，美国就积极地以军火供给逃缅的蒋匪军残部。
