　　Prevent Porters from Being Poisoned!
    In recent months, incidents of porters being poisoned by carrying toxic substances have occurred continuously in Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Beijing, and other places. The most serious incidents were in Qingdao and Yantai, where eight consecutive incidents occurred, poisoning a total of 570 workers, and causing two deaths. This matter should attract serious attention from public and private enterprises, transportation companies, and relevant government departments in various regions. The reasons for these incidents are mainly due to the extreme lack of concern among relevant cadres for the health and safety of the porters. They fail to provide workers with necessary anti-poisoning equipment, and fail to conduct anti-poisoning education for them. They casually allow workers to carry goods without asking whether they are toxic; some even knowingly allow workers to carry toxic substances without taking measures to protect their safety. The relevant local government departments should seriously investigate and deal with the worker poisoning incidents that have already occurred in various regions, and publish the results in newspapers to educate everyone. In the future, in order to prevent such accidents from happening, transportation departments should stipulate necessary safety regulations for transporting toxic substances, equip necessary anti-poisoning equipment, and conduct safety and anti-poisoning education for workers. If accidents occur, they must not shirk their responsibility by claiming "lack of understanding of the nature of the goods." All units that sell and transport toxic substances must inform the transportation department of the nature of the goods in advance. Failure to do so should be subject to legal sanctions. Enterprises that produce toxic substances must strictly package toxic goods and indicate the nature of the goods on the packaging when they leave the factory.

　　防止搬运工人中毒！
    最近数月，在青岛、烟台、天津、张家口、北京等地，曾不断发生搬运工人因搬运毒性物品而中毒的事件，最严重的如青岛、烟台两地，曾接连发生八次，共有五百七十个工人中毒，并有两人中毒至死。这事应引起各地公私企业、搬运公司及政府有关部门的严重注意。发生这些事件的原因，主要是由于有关干部对搬运工人的健康和安全问题极不关心，不给工人设置必要的防毒器具，不向工人进行防毒教育；不问货物是否有毒，就随便让工人搬运；有的甚至明知有毒，也不去设法保护工人的安全。对各地已经发生的工人中毒事件，当地政府有关部门应认真查究处理，并将处理结果在报上公布，以便教育大家。今后，为防止此类事故发生，搬运部门对搬运毒性物品应规定必要的安全制度，备置必要的防毒器具，向工人进行安全防毒教育；若发生事故，绝不得以“不了解物品性质”来推卸自己的责任；各出售和购运毒性物品的单位，必须把物品性质事先告知搬运部门，如不这样作，则应受到法律的制裁；生产毒性物品的企业，在毒性货品出厂时，必须严加包装，并在包皮上注明物品的性质。
