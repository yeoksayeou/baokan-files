Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. Our correspondent learned from the headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers: The first meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations was held at 10:00 AM (Korean time) on the 10th in Kaesong. General Nam Il, chief representative of the Korean People's Army, delivered a speech, outlining the basic attitude of the Chinese and Korean people toward the Korean armistice negotiations. The full text is as follows:

"On June 30th, General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, expressed his willingness to hold armistice negotiations. My Commander-in-Chief, General Kim Il-sung, and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Peng Dehuai, in accordance with the wishes and demands of the people of Korea and China and the people of the world, agreed to hold negotiations with General Ridgway and sent me to represent the Korean People's Army at this negotiation. The Korean people have always advocated, and still advocate, that the Korean War should be ended quickly. Therefore, they warmly support the proposal made by Mr. Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, on June 23rd that the belligerent parties should negotiate a ceasefire and armistice, and that both sides should withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel. In order to stop the Korean War, we believe that it is necessary to resolve the issues of ceasefire, the withdrawal of troops from both sides from the 38th parallel as a basic condition for achieving a Korean armistice, and the withdrawal of foreign troops to ensure that the flames of war in Korea will not reignite. Therefore, I, representing the Korean People's Army, propose the following suggestions:

First, on the basis of mutual agreement, both sides should simultaneously order a cessation of all hostile military actions. The army should cease all offensives, attacks, and reconnaissance against the other side. The navy should cease all bombardments, blockades, and reconnaissance against the other side. The air forces of both sides should cease all bombing and reconnaissance against the other side. Obviously, a ceasefire by both sides will not only reduce the loss of life and property but will also be the first step in extinguishing the flames of war within Korea.

Second, the 38th parallel should be established as the military demarcation line, and the armed forces of both sides should simultaneously withdraw ten kilometers from the 38th parallel and complete this within a certain time limit. The area vacated by both sides should be designated as a demilitarized zone, where neither side shall station armed forces or conduct any military actions. The civil administration in this area should be restored to its state before June 25, 1950. At the same time, negotiations on the exchange of prisoners of war should be conducted immediately so that prisoners of war from all countries can return home and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

Third, all foreign troops should be withdrawn within the shortest possible time. The withdrawal of foreign troops will provide a basic guarantee for the cessation of the Korean War and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean people, the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and all peace-loving people around the world, including the people of the United States and Britain, warmly demand an early end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. I hope that we can reach an agreement in this negotiation to meet the demands of the broad masses of the people."

General Deng Hua, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, then delivered a speech in support of General Nam Il's statement. The full text is as follows:

"I have been ordered by General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers assisting the Korean People's Army in its operations in Korea, to attend this meeting together with the representatives of the Korean People's Army to discuss, on a fair and reasonable basis, the realization of a ceasefire and armistice within Korea. I believe that the resolution of these issues will be a major step towards the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The interests of the people of China and Korea are completely consistent. Ending the Korean War and peacefully resolving the Korean issue are also the consistent demands of the Chinese people and the goal they have been striving for. The purpose of the Chinese People's Volunteers in assisting the Korean People's Army is to restore peace to Korea and safeguard China's security. Therefore, when Mr. Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, based on the Soviet government's consistent position of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, proposed that the belligerent parties in Korea negotiate a ceasefire and armistice and that both sides withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel, this proposal immediately gained the warm support of the Chinese people and the Chinese government. A ceasefire between the belligerent parties in Korea, the establishment of the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line between the two sides, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops are in line with the wishes and demands of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world. We believe that the three suggestions put forward by the representative of the Korean People's Army are the premise and foundation for stopping the Korean War and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. The Chinese People's Volunteers wholeheartedly support these suggestions and believe that they should be taken as the starting point of the negotiations. People of all countries hate war and yearn for peace. I hope that we can successfully complete the task of stopping the Korean War."

　　朝鲜停战谈判举行首次会议
    南日将军提出三项建议
    邓华将军指出这是谈判出发点
    【新华社平壤十日电】本社记者自朝鲜人民军总司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部获悉：朝鲜停战谈判首次会议已于十日上午十时（朝鲜时间）在开城举行。朝鲜人民军总司令部首席代表南日将军致词，扼要地说明了中朝两国人民对此次朝鲜停战谈判的基本态度，全文如下：
    “六月三十日联合国军总司令李奇微将军表示，愿意举行停战谈判。我的总司令金日成将军和中国志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，根据朝中人民及全世界人民的愿望与要求，赞成与李奇微将军举行谈判，并派我代表朝鲜人民军出席这次谈判。朝鲜人民历来主张，现在仍然主张，朝鲜战争应该迅速结束，因此热烈赞成苏联驻联合国代表马立克先生六月二十三日提出的交战双方应该谈判停火与休战，而双方把军队撤离三八线。为了停止朝鲜战争，我们认为就要解决停火，双方军队撤离三八线，作为实现朝鲜休战的基本条件及撤退外国军队以保证朝鲜战火之不再复燃等重要问题。因此，我代表朝鲜人民军提出下述建议：
    第一，在互相协议的基础上，双方同时下令停止一切敌对军事行动，陆军停止对对方的进攻、袭击与侦察；海军停止对对方的轰击封锁与侦察；双方空军停止对对方的轰炸与侦察。显然，双方停火，不但可以减少生命财产的损失，而且是扑灭朝鲜境内战火的第一步。
    第二，确定三八线为军事分界线，双方武装部队应同时撤离三八线十公里，并于一定时限内完成之。以双方撤离的地区为非军事地带，双方皆不驻扎武装部队或进行任何军事行动。这里的民政，恢复一九五○年六月二十五日以前的原状。与此同时，立即进行关于交换俘虏的商谈，使各国俘虏早日还乡与家人团聚。
    第三，应在尽可能短的时间内撤退一切外国军队。外国军队撤退了，朝鲜战争的停止与朝鲜问题的和平解决，便有了基本的保障。朝鲜人民、中国人民、苏联人民及全世界一切爱好和平的人民，包括美、英人民在内，都热烈要求早日停止朝鲜战争，并和平解决朝鲜问题。我希望我们能够在这次谈判中达成协议，以满足广大人民的要求。”
    中国人民志愿军代表邓华将军继致词，支持南日将军的发言，原文如下：
    “我奉协助朝鲜人民军在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军之命，出席这次会议，与朝鲜人民军代表一同，和联合国军总司令李奇微将军的代表，商讨在公平合理的基础上，实现在朝鲜境内停火与休战等问题。我认为这些问题的解决，将是在和平解决朝鲜问题上，走了重大的一步。
    中朝两国人民的利害是完全一致的，结束朝鲜战争与和平解决朝鲜问题，同样是中国人民一贯的要求，并为之不断奋斗的目标。中国人民志愿军援助朝鲜人民军的目的，就是恢复朝鲜的和平，及保障中国的安全。因此，当苏联驻联合国代表马立克先生根据苏联政府和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张，建议由朝鲜交战双方谈判停火与休战而双方把军队撤离三八线时，这一建议，便立即获得中国人民及中国政府的热烈支持。在朝鲜作战双方停火，确定三八线为双方军事分界线，及撤退一切外国军队，是符合朝鲜人民、中国人民以及全世界人民的愿望和要求的。我们认为朝鲜人民军的代表所提出的三项建议，是停止朝鲜战争及和平解决朝鲜问题的前提与基础。中国人民志愿军衷心支持这些建议，并认为应把它们作为谈判出发点。各国人民都痛恨战争而热望和平。我希望我们能够顺利完成停止朝鲜战争的任务。”
