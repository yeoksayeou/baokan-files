In order to enhance the correct understanding of unified job assignment by the government among higher education graduates, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government jointly organized the "1951 North China Higher Education Graduates Summer Study Group," which opened in Beijing on the 6th. Two thousand six hundred graduates from universities and colleges in Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Taiyuan, and other places are participating in the study. The study period is approximately one week.

He called on the students to better understand the meaning of "obeying the state's unified assignment" during their studies, and to take on the responsibility of building the great motherland in their work posts. President Ma Yinchu specifically listed the great achievements of the country's construction in the past year and a half, explaining that the country's future is infinitely bright and promising; the future of higher education graduates, as "engineers of national construction," is also infinitely bright and promising. Student representatives Zhong Liqing, Wu Defang, and Bian Yongnian also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to obey the government's assignment, go to the places where the motherland needs them most, and play their greatest role. They will be good students of Mao Zedong in school and good cadres of Mao Zedong at work.

    中央人民政府教育部、人事部为提高高等学校毕业学生对政府统一分配工作的正确认识联合举办的“一九五一年华北区高等学校毕业生暑期学习团”已于六日在京开学。参加学习的有北京、天津、保定、太原等地高等学校毕业生二千六百人。学习时间约一星期。学习内容有中央人民政府各有关部门首长关于祖国各方面建设工作的报告和讨论等。
    在六日的开学典礼大会上，教育部马叙伦部长、曾昭抡副部长、北京大学校长马寅初、北京师范大学校长林砺儒、清华大学教务长周培源、燕京大学教务长翁独健等向学生们讲话。马叙伦部长指出，过去在反动统治时代的“毕业就是失业”和“用非所学”的现象，今天是已经基本消灭了。他号召同学们在学习中要更好地认识“服从国家统一分配”的意义，到工作岗位上去担负起伟大祖国的建设责任。马寅初校长具体地列举了国家一年半来建设的伟大的成就，说明国家的前程是无限光辉远大的；作为“祖国建设工程师”的高等学校毕业生的前程也是无限光辉远大的。学生代表钟历清、邬德芳、边永年等也在会上讲了话。他们一致表示要服从政府分配，到祖国最需要的地方去，发挥最大的作用。在学校里是毛泽东的好学生，在工作中要作毛泽东的好干部。
