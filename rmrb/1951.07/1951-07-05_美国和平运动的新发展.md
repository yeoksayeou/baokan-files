　　New Developments in the American Peace Movement
    After overcoming various obstacles and difficulties, the American National Peace Conference was successfully held in Chicago from June 29th to July 1st. Approximately 5,000 peace activists from all 48 states of the United States gathered to discuss and pass several important resolutions to expand and strengthen the American peace movement, and established the National Peace Council to unify and lead the peace movement. These significant achievements of the American National Peace Conference mark a new development in the American peace movement.
    First, the establishment of the American National Peace Council will have a significant impetus on the development of the American peace movement. Since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the American people's opposition to the Truman government's war policy has been increasing day by day, and more and more Americans have developed their desire for peace into practical actions to fight for peace. Various peace groups, supported by the broad masses of people, have been continuously increasing in strength, and have organized many peace rallies and demonstrations. However, their past actions were scattered and lacked a united organization, and therefore could not develop into a powerful united force to stop the war under unified leadership. After this American National Peace Conference, the broad masses of peace-loving Americans will be able to unite under the banner of the American National Peace Council to fight together for peace and against war.
    The American National Peace Conference not only established an institution to unify and lead the American peace movement, but also adopted a unified action program to guide the American people in their struggle for peace. This is another major advance in the American peace movement. The "Declaration of Principles" and peace program adopted by the National Conference, reflecting the American people's desire for peace, put forward the most urgent demands of the American people, which first and foremost is the demand for the complete restoration of peace in Korea, and also the demand for immediate great power negotiations to resolve all differences, reduce armaments, and abolish weapons of mass destruction with supervision of their implementation. These are all necessary steps to eliminate the war crisis and international tensions in a peaceful way, and are also the common demands of the world's peace-loving people in their struggle for peace. This will make the American people's peace movement more closely integrated with the peace-defending struggles of the people of all countries in the world, and jointly strive to defeat the war policies of the American ruling clique.
    The "Letter to Workers" passed by the conference, calling on American workers to form a united front to fight for peace and against warmongers, is of utmost importance to expanding the base of the American peace movement. The resolution of the 15th National Convention of the Communist Party of the United States pointed out: "All those who seek peace must form a vast peace front." The American working class is the leading force of the American peace movement, so their adherence to and development of the policy of a united front for peace will surely make the American peace front more consolidated and stronger.
    These achievements of the American National Peace Conference have advanced the American peace movement to a new stage. With the support of the peace-loving people all over the world, we firmly believe that the American peace movement will be able to achieve even greater successes.

　　美国和平运动的新发展
    美国全国和平大会在克服了各种阻碍与困难之后，已于六月二十九日至七月一日在芝加哥胜利举行。来自全美四十八州的约五千名和平斗士聚会一堂，讨论与通过了扩大与加强美国和平运动的多项重要决议，并成立了统一领导和平运动的全国和平委员会。美国全国和平大会的这些重大成就，标志了美国和平运动的新发展。
    首先，美国全国和平委员会的成立对于美国和平运动的发展，将有重大的推动作用。自从美国发动侵朝战争以来，美国人民反对杜鲁门政府战争政策的情绪一天比一天高涨，并且愈来愈多的美国人民已把对和平的渴望发展为争取和平的实际行动。各个和平团体因为获得广大人民的支持，力量不断增加，而且组织了许多的和平集会和示威运动。但是他们过去的行动是分散的，还缺乏一个联合的组织，因而也就不能在统一领导之下，发展成为一个有力的阻止战争的联合力量。在这次美国全国和平大会以后，广大的美国爱好和平的人民，将可以团结在美国全国和平委员会的旗帜下，共同为争取和平、反对战争而斗争。
    美国全国和平大会不但成立了统一领导美国和平运动的机构，并且通过了指导美国人民争取和平的统一的行动纲领。这是美国和平运动的又一重大进步。全国大会通过的反映美国人民和平意愿的“原则宣言”和和平纲领，提出了美国人民最急迫的要求，这首先就是要求完全恢复朝鲜和平，并且要求立即举行大国谈判以解决一切纷歧，裁减军备和废弃大规模毁灭的武器并监督其执行。这都是以和平方式消除战争危机与国际紧张局势的必要步骤，同时也是世界爱好和平人民争取和平斗争的共同主张。这样就使得美国人民的和平运动与世界各国人民保卫和平斗争更加紧密地结合起来，共同为击败美国统治集团的战争政策而奋斗。
    大会通过的号召美国工人组成争取和平反对战争贩子的统一战线的《告工人书》，对于扩大美国和平运动的基础是有着极其重大的意义。美共第十五次全国大会的决议中就曾指出：“凡是企求和平的人，必须组成一个巨大的和平阵线。”美国工人阶级是美国和平运动的领导力量，因此他们对于和平统一战线政策的坚持与发展，必将使得美国的和平阵线更加巩固与壮大。
    美国全国和平大会的这些成就，已将美国和平运动推进到一个新的阶段，在全世界爱好和平人民的支援之下，我们深信美国和平运动必能有更大的成就。
