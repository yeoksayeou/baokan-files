I returned to Shanghai with excitement and elation. The warm welcome from my classmates deeply moved me. When I shook hands with everyone enthusiastically, I felt an emotion that surpassed mere friendship; I realized this was the feeling of comrades who love the motherland, love humanity, and strive for the same goal. More than five months ago, under the solemn call of the motherland, amidst everyone's earnest encouragement and warm send-off, we arrived at the military cadre school. The gains from the past five months of study far exceeded my previous ten years of learning, which made me truly realize that the revolutionary ranks are a great melting pot. Here, every piece of iron can be forged into good steel. I am willing to write down my progress in learning over the past five months to provide a reference for students who are enthusiastically preparing to sign up for military cadre school.

The past five months of study have made me deeply feel the importance of national defense construction. The leaders have told us more than once that as long as imperialism exists, we cannot relax our national defense construction for a single day. Therefore, it has deepened my sense of responsibility to defend the motherland. I actively devoted myself to studying, transforming, and training myself. For example, we have a physical education course called "Walking the Sky Bridge," which requires everyone to walk across a very high and narrow bridge. The first time I walked up, my legs weakened, but I remembered the education our leaders gave us, and a strong idea of "building a strong physique to defend the motherland" filled my heart. I felt that my responsibility to defend the motherland was significant, and I must persevere in learning all my lessons well. I finally walked across bravely.

In the past five months, I have also continuously tempered myself through labor, transforming myself from a weak and incompetent student into a revolutionary fighter. In the past, I was a person who couldn't work. On my first day at the military cadre school, my classmates were all busy unpacking their bedding and making their beds, but as for me, I was simply at a loss, taking the bedding back and forth, turning it over and over, and after a long time, it was still just a bedding. This small matter fully demonstrated my weakness and dependence. When I was at home, I couldn't do anything, but I didn't feel ashamed. On the contrary, I felt very happy and proud. When I arrived in the revolutionary ranks, the leaders and comrades took care of me in every aspect of my life, like a mother taking care of me. The great class friendship made me feel ashamed and disgraceful. Why couldn't I be strong? I began to hate the environment I was in in the past, and I was determined to train myself in practical life to become a true revolutionary fighter. We opened up our own playground and carried out labor production. Through these tasks, I gained an understanding of labor. Whether it was washing a piece of clothing or turning over a piece of soil, I realized the joy of labor. The transformation from someone who couldn't wash a handkerchief or make a bed to someone who can carry out labor production, cut wheat, and carry manure, such a transformation is not easy, and it can only be achieved in the revolutionary ranks and under the leadership of the Party.

I have also made great progress in dealing with family issues. In the past, when I thought of my mother and my home, I was always entangled in personal maternal affection. My mother is a typical old-fashioned housewife who loves her children more than her own life. Therefore, when I joined the military cadre school, how to persuade my mother became my biggest concern. The first step was to encourage my mother to join the Family Women's Federation, because with the help of the Women's Federation, my mother would definitely make progress. Then, on the "December 9th" day, I made the greatest determination to express to my mother my firm will to join the military cadre school. Although my mother was reluctant to part with me, she saw that I was very determined, and she said, "I will let you go. Since I love you, I shouldn't go against your wishes, as long as the path you take is correct." My mother's encouragement made my will even firmer, and it also prompted my mother to be more determined to let me go. After arriving at the cadre school, my mother came to see me twice. She saw our happy life and tense learning with her own eyes and deeply realized that "it is most glorious to hand over children to the motherland and Chairman Mao." Not only did she realize it, but my mother also answered the motherland with practical actions. She also actively worked. She said, "Your action of joining the military cadre school educated me. The motherland belongs to each of us. It's a pity that I'm too old to be with you, but I should also do my best!" A virtuous wife and good mother who didn't care about politics has now become an activist among women. I realized for the first time that I love my mother so much, not only with maternal love but also with comradely love. The facts show that the love of children for their mother and the love for the motherland can be completely combined.

Dear classmates, when the motherland calls us again today, let us actively sign up! Let our youth be more beautiful and meaningful!

　　我在军干校中锻炼成长
    吴志莲
    我怀着兴奋激动的心情回到上海。同学们对我们热烈的欢迎使我深深地感动。当我与大家热情握手的时候，我感觉到有一种超乎朋友的感情，我体会到这是我们爱祖国、爱人类，为同一目标奋斗的同志的感情。五个多月前，在祖国庄严的召唤下，在大家殷切的鼓励和热诚的欢送声中，我们到了军事干部学校。五个月来学习的收获远远地超过了过去十几年的学习，这使我真正地体会到革命队伍是个大熔炉。在这里，每一块铁都能炼成好钢。我愿将我五个月来在学习上的进步写出来，提供给正在踊跃地准备报名参加军事干部学校的同学们参考。
    五个月来的学习，使我深深地感觉到国防建设的重要性。首长们不止一次地对我们说过，帝国主义存在一天，我们就一天不能放松我们的国防建设。因此，使我加深了保卫祖国的责任感。我积极地投入了学习，改造和锻炼自己。譬如我们有一种体育课目叫“走天桥”，要大家在很高很狭的桥上走过去。第一次刚走上去时，我的脚也软了，然而我记起了领导上对我们的教育，一种强烈的为“保卫祖国锻炼好坚强的体魄”的思想充满在我的心头，我感觉到我自己保卫祖国的责任是重大的，我必须坚持学好一切功课，我终于勇敢地走过去了。
    五个月来，我还不断地从劳动中锻炼了自己，使自己由一个软弱无能的学生，变成一个革命战士。过去，我是一个不会劳动的人，我第一天到军事干部学校时，同学们都忙着打开铺盖，铺床睡觉，而我呢，简直是束手无策，把铺盖拿来拿去，翻上翻下，搞了半天还是这样一个铺盖。从这么一件小事，充分地表现出我的软弱性和依赖性。在家里的时候我什么也不会，但我没有感到可耻，相反地我觉得我很幸福，很值得骄傲；到了革命队伍里，首长们同志们在生活上处处照顾我，像母亲照顾我一样，伟大的阶级友爱使我感到惭愧可耻，我为什么不能坚强起来呢？我开始对我过去所处的环境憎恶起来，我决心要在实际生活中锻炼自己，使我成为真正的革命战士。我们开辟了自己的操场，进行了劳动生产。通过这些工作，我对劳动有了认识，无论是洗完一件衣服，或者翻了一块土，我都领会到劳动的愉快。从一个不会洗一块手帕，不会打铺盖铺床的人转变到能进行劳动生产，能割麦子，能抬大粪，这样一个转变是不容易的，只有在革命队伍里，只有在党的领导下才能如此。
    在处理家庭问题上，我也有了很大的进步。过去，我想到母亲，想到家，老是纠缠在个人的母女私情上。我的母亲是一个典型的旧社会的家庭妇女，她爱子女超过于自己的生命。因此在我参加军事干部学校时，怎样去说服母亲就成了我最大的一个顾虑。第一步我动员母亲参加家庭妇联，因为在妇联的帮助下是一定会使我母亲进步的。然后在“一二九”那一天，我下了最大的决心向母亲表示了我要参加军事干部学校的坚定的意志。母亲虽然舍不得我，但是她看见我很坚决，她说：“我会让你去的，我既然爱你就不应该违背你的志愿，只要你走的路是正确的。”母亲的鼓励使我的意志更坚决，这也促使母亲让我去的心更坚定。到了干部学校以后，母亲来看过我二次，她亲眼看到我们愉快的生活，紧张的学习，深深地体会到“把孩子交给祖国，交给毛主席是最光荣的”。不仅仅是体会，母亲更以实际行动来回答祖国，她也积极地工作。她说：“你参加军事干部学校的行动教育了我，祖国是我们每个人的，可惜我年纪老了不能和你们在一起，但是我也应该尽我最大的努力！”一个不问政治的贤妻良母，现在变成了妇女中的一个积极分子。我第一次发觉我是这样地爱我的母亲，除了母女的爱以外还有着同志的爱。事实说明，子女对母亲的爱与对祖国的爱是完全可以结合起来的。
    亲爱的同学们，当今天祖国再一次号召我们的时候，让我们积极地报名吧！让我们的青春过得更美丽、更有意义吧！
