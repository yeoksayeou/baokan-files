Special Column:

(Sixteen) One car was gasoline, one car was grain, and the car body was already on fire. The thick smoke made it impossible to open your eyes. However, the five people were determined to rescue these supplies even at the cost of their lives. Everyone bravely pushed the grain and gasoline drums out of the burning carriage.

(Seventeen) The fire was burning their clothes, and the temperature in the car was extremely high. It looked like the gasoline drums would burst into flames, but everyone kept unloading the gasoline drums before jumping out of the car. After counting, a total of ninety barrels of gasoline, seventy boxes of oil, and half a car of grain were rescued.

(Eighteen) The local Korean people also spontaneously gathered to help carry these supplies to the station and continue to send them to the front line. Comrade Song Xiankui first thought of the interests of the country in the most dangerous moments and took the lead in everything. He gloriously earned a special-class merit citation. (The End)

    英韬  画
  （十六）一车是汽油，一车是粮食，车皮已经烧着了，浓烟薰得睁不开眼。但是，五个人都下了决心，拼着命也得把这些物资抢救出来。个个都奋勇的把粮食和汽油桶推出燃烧的车箱。
  （十七）火都烧着衣服了，车里温度极高，眼看汽油桶就会喷出火来，但大家一直把汽油桶卸完才跳下车。算了算，一共抢出了九十桶汽油、七十箱机油，还有半车粮食。
  （十八）当地的朝鲜人民，也自动集拢来帮助把这些物资抬到车站，继续送到前线去。宋显魁同志在最危险的关头，先想到国家的利益，处处起带头作用，他光荣地立下了特功。（完）
