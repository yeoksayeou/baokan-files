Bureaucracy and Local Viewpoints of Leading Cadres Ruined Important Matters
 Repeated Reworking of the Xiangtang Project by the Shanghai Railway Bureau Resulted in Great Waste
 The Bureau is Inspecting Capital Construction Work According to the Instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Committee
Leading cadres of the Shanghai Railway Administration and the Nanchang Branch Bureau did not conduct thorough investigation and research beforehand in the construction of the Xiangtang Station and locomotive depot, resulting in repeated rework and great waste. For example, if the initial estimated construction cost in the plan proposed by the bureau at the end of 1949 was 100%, the construction cost increased to 429% by the end of 1950, more than three times higher than the initial estimate. Moreover, many projects were poorly done. For example, the turntable had poor drainage, loose rivets, several cracks in the concrete around the disc, and leaks in the inspection wells.

The leading cadres of the Shanghai Railway Administration did not clearly understand how the construction of the Xiangtang locomotive depot should be designed, how to construct it, and how to allocate resources beforehand. They did not conduct on-site investigation and research during planning and design, and even copied the engineering drawings from other places. In specific construction, there was no dedicated organization to uniformly and specifically lead the project, and there was a lack of an overall construction plan. As a result, the construction steps were chaotic, often proceeding without considering priorities, doing whatever came to mind, and improvising; this resulted in serious rework and waste. Initially, 200 million yuan was spent to build unnecessary walls, while the urgently needed material warehouse was not built, affecting the progress of the project. The five construction units (water supply engineering team, construction engineering team, bridge team, track laying team of the engineering section, and earthwork team) could not cooperate with each other due to the lack of a unified and comprehensive construction plan. It was originally planned to complete the coal platform and the westward platform by the end of September to coordinate with the Ministry of Railways' decision to change the winter timetable starting on October 1st; however, by mid-September, the coal platform had not yet been erected, and the westward platform could not be started due to unfinished earthwork, and it was still not completed until mid-October. Fortunately, the Ministry of Railways postponed the winter timetable change, otherwise, it would have hindered the completion of transportation tasks. The water pipes in the locomotive depot were not installed by the locomotive department until the concrete floor was laid and then chiseled open for burial. The drawings for the Class A inspection platform were repeatedly changed, and after the foundation was laid, it was chiseled open and redone, causing great waste.

This bureaucratic style of not seriously leading the engineering personnel to conduct on-site investigation and research for correct design before construction, and not inspecting the work after construction, is a concrete manifestation of not cherishing state property. The chief of the locomotive section of the Nanchang Branch Bureau said: "I never paid attention to how those locomotive equipment was made." Some responsible comrades of the Nanchang Branch Bureau even thought that building a locomotive depot in Xiangtang would reduce the business of Nanchang, and the heads of the branch bureau would become "air force commanders," so they did not want to move the units to Xiangtang. This serious local viewpoint, the idea of not starting from the overall national interest, is another important reason for the rework and waste.

In April of this year, the Shanghai Railway Administration, in accordance with the Interim Procedures for Capital Construction Work promulgated by the Central Finance and Economics Committee, inspected the engineering construction of the Xiangtang locomotive depot, ordered the leading cadres of the Nanchang Railway Branch Bureau to conduct a profound self-criticism, and established the Xiangtang Construction Committee. It is now improving the shortcomings in the past projects and correctly leading the smooth progress of this project.

### 领导干部的官僚主义和局部观点坏了大事  上海铁路局向塘工程一再返工浪费很大  该局正根据中央财经委员会指示检查基本建设工作

　　领导干部的官僚主义和局部观点坏了大事
　  上海铁路局向塘工程一再返工浪费很大
　  该局正根据中央财经委员会指示检查基本建设工作
    上海铁路管理局和南昌分局领导干部在建设向塘车站和机务段等工程中，事先没有很好地调查研究，以致不少工程一再返工，造成很大浪费。如以该局在一九四九年底提出的计划中最初估计的建设费为百分之一百，到一九五○年底建设费即增加到百分之四百二十九，竟比最初估计高出三倍多。而且许多工程做得很坏。如：转车盘排水不良，铆钉松动，盘周的混凝土有数处裂缝，阴井漏水。
    上海铁路管理局领导干部对于建设向塘机务段这样工程究竟应该怎样设计、怎样施工、怎样配备力量，事先都没有弄清楚。计划和设计时没有实地调查研究，甚至把其他地方的工程设计图搬来照办。在具体施工中，又没有一个专门机构来统一地具体地领导工程的进行，而且缺乏一个全盘的施工计划。因此施工时步骤紊乱，往往不分缓急先后，想到一点做一点，做到那里算那里；结果造成严重的多次的返工浪费。最初费了两亿工款建筑不必要的围墙，而迫切需要的材料库却没有去建筑，影响了工程的进行。五个施工单位（给水工程队、建筑工程队、桥工队、工务段钉道队及土方队），因为缺乏统一全面的施工计划，不能相互配合。原定九月底完成煤台、向西站台，以便配合铁道部十月一日起冬季改点的决定；但到九月中旬，煤台还未架设，向西站台因土方未做成不能动工，直到十月中旬，还未能完工。幸而铁道部冬季改点延期，否则，将有碍运输任务的完成。机车库水管，机务部门迟迟不装，直到水泥地坪都打好了又凿开埋置。甲检台的图样一再改换，基础都打好了，又凿开重做，造成很大浪费。
    这种施工前不认真领导工程人员实地调查研究进行正确的设计，施工后对工作又不检查的官僚主义作风，是不爱惜国家财产的具体表现。南昌分局机务科长说：“那些机务设备怎样做，我根本就没有过问过。”南昌分局某些负责同志，还以为在向塘建设机务段，将使南昌业务减少，分局首长将成“空军司令”，因此不想把各单位搬往向塘。这种严重的局部观点，不从整个国家利益出发的思想，是造成返工浪费的另一重要原因。
    今年四月上海铁路管理局已根据中央财政经济委员会颁布的基本建设工作程序暂行办法，检查了向塘机务段的工程建设，令南昌铁路分局领导干部作深刻的自我检讨，并成立了向塘建设委员会。现在正在改进过去工程中的缺点，并正确地领导这一工程顺利进行。
