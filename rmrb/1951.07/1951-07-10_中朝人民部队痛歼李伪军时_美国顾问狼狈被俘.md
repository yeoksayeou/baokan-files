　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
　　Korean Front Dispatch: During the counter-attack in May, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces captured many American advisors within the Li Seung-man pseudo-army. They were all in a very embarrassing state when they were captured.
　　After the Li pseudo-army was defeated, its officers and soldiers scattered in all directions; the American advisors, unfamiliar with the area, fled like stray dogs into gullies and forests. The search troops of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces rooted these fellows out. Although these American officers destroyed all documents that could prove their identity as advisors before being captured, they had to confess the truth after being identified by Li pseudo-army prisoners, even though they claimed to be "soldiers" or "driving cars."
　　Major Faxing, an advisor to the 30th Regiment of the Li pseudo-army's 9th Division, wandered alone after the regiment was defeated, but could not escape the encirclement and had to hide in a cave. When the search troops of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces searched the cave entrance, this major, soaked and shivering, crawled out, straightened his stooped body, stood at attention, and raised his hands as a prisoner.
　　Lieutenant Dottie, an air liaison advisor stationed at the Li pseudo-army's 9th Division headquarters, and his assistant, Corporal Collins, destroyed the air liaison board and radio transmitter after the headquarters was disrupted, ran from the top of the mountain to the mountainside, and lay on the ground, attempting to resist stubbornly. Sheng Yuanji, a fighter in the Volunteer Army search team, quietly approached them from behind and shouted. When the two fellows turned around and saw that it was the Volunteer Army, they quickly threw down their weapons, turned face up, lay on the spot, and raised their hands.
　　Captain Beck, an advisor to the 3rd Battalion of the 29th Regiment of the pseudo-army's 9th Division, fled eastward with more than 40 Li pseudo-soldiers; he fell behind because he couldn't keep up. These forty or so pseudo-soldiers were soon captured by the Volunteer Army. This advisor came up from behind with a pistol in his hand, unaware that these pseudo-soldiers had been captured. He furiously scolded the pseudo-soldiers for walking too fast. Ren Deju, a Volunteer Army soldier, was both amused and angry to see this fellow still throwing his weight around at this time. When he approached, he suddenly pointed his gun at him, ordering him not to move. Only then did this fellow understand what was happening. Helplessly, he dropped his gun, raised his hands, and joined the ranks of the prisoners.
　　The news of the defeat of the Li pseudo-army shocked the headquarters of the US military advisory group, and the heads of the advisors hurriedly ordered Shi Leitui, a major advisor to the Li pseudo-army's 1st Army, to take five people in two jeeps to the front line to supervise the battle and guide the advisory group personnel to break through the encirclement. Shi Leitui had been an advisor in the Li pseudo-army since 1949. During the New Year's offensive by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, the pseudo-army's 6th Division, where he was stationed at the time, was defeated twice, and he and the remnants of the advisory group managed to escape the encirclement. For this, the Li bandit Seung-man presented him with a "medal," and the US invading army's newspaper, the *Stars and Stripes*, hailed him as a "breakthrough hero." This time, Shi Leitui was prepared to create his second "heroic feat." When he arrived at the position of the pseudo-army's 9th Division, the division was already in complete disarray. They had no choice but to sit in the jeeps, squeeze into the ranks of the Li pseudo-army's defeated soldiers, and flee south in a panic. However, their escape route was cut off. He and the five people who came with him abandoned their vehicles and fled into the gully with three carbines and a light machine gun. They roamed in the wilderness for five days, but still could not escape the search circle. The "breakthrough hero" and his companions were exhausted and hungry, and were cooking corn kernels behind a pile of rocks in a gully. But before the corn kernels could be eaten, a search team of the Volunteer Army suddenly appeared in front of them, and the "breakthrough hero" became a prisoner of the Volunteer Army.

### 中朝人民部队痛歼李伪军时  美国顾问狼狈被俘

　　中朝人民部队痛歼李伪军时
    美国顾问狼狈被俘
    【新华社讯】朝鲜前线通讯：在五月的反击战中，朝、中人民部队俘掳了不少李承晚伪军中的美国顾问。他们被俘的时候，情形都非常狼狈。
    李伪军被击溃以后，它的官兵东逃西散；人地生疏的美国顾问们更是像丧家狗一样往山沟、树林里乱躲乱窜。朝、中人民部队的搜索部队，把这些家伙都搜出来了。这些美国军官虽然在被俘之前毁灭了一切足以证明他们的顾问身份的证件，但是在李伪军俘虏指认之下，这些自称是“当兵的”“开汽车的”顾问们，就只得供认不讳了。
    李伪军第九师第三十团的少校顾问法兴，在该团被击溃以后便只身乱窜，但总是窜不出包围圈，只得隐藏在一个岩洞里。朝、中人民部队的搜索部队搜到洞口的时候，这个浑身湿透、发着抖的少校爬了出来，挺起佝偻的身体立正之后，举起双手当了俘虏。
    驻李伪军第九师司令部的对空联络顾问美国空军中尉多尔提和他的助手伍长柯林斯，在该司令部被打乱以后，就将对空联络板和无线电发报机毁坏，从山顶跑到山腰，卧倒在地上，企图进行顽抗。志愿军搜索部队战士盛元吉悄悄地摸到他们后面，大喊一声，两个家伙回头一看是志愿军，赶忙将武器一丢，翻了个脸朝天，仰卧在原地，举起了双手。
    伪军第九师第二十九团第三营的上尉顾问倍克，带着四十多个李伪军东逃西窜；他因走不动掉了队。这四十多个伪军不久就被志愿军全部俘虏。这个顾问提着手枪从后面赶来，还不知道这些伪军已被俘虏。他气势汹汹地大骂伪军士兵走得太快。志愿军战士任德举看到这个家伙到这个时候还这样作威作福，又好气又好笑，等他走近时就突然用枪对准他，命令他不要动；这个家伙这才明白了是怎么一回事，无可奈何地扔掉枪，举起手走进了俘虏行列。
    李伪军被击溃的消息震动了美军顾问团总部，顾问头子们就急忙命令李伪军第一军的少校顾问史雷突，带着五个人，坐了两辆吉普车，赶到前线去督战，并引导顾问团人员突围。史雷突从一九四九年起就在李伪军中当顾问，在中、朝人民部队的新年攻势中，他当时所在的伪第六师两次被击溃，他带着顾问团的残余侥幸逃出了包围。为此李匪承晚对他献以“勋章”，美侵略军机关报星条报把他捧为“突围英雄”。这次史雷突准备创造他的第二次“英雄事迹”。当他赶到伪第九师阵地时，该师已经溃不成军。他们只好坐在吉普车上，挤在李伪军溃兵行列中狼狈向南逃命。可是他们的逃路被切断了。他和同来的五个人带着三支卡宾枪和一挺轻机枪弃车逃进山沟。他们在荒山丛林中窜了五天，仍是逃不出搜索圈。“突围英雄”和他的伙伴们又困又饿，就在一个山沟里的乱石堆后面煮苞米粒吃。可是苞米粒还没有吃进口，志愿军的一支搜索部队突然出现在他们面前，“突围英雄”就这样成了志愿军的俘虏。
