    Reworking Warehouse Repairs Results in Waste
    Time Not Urgent, Materials Not Lacking
    Only Due to Irresponsibility of Relevant Personnel

    Editor:
    After reading Comrade Chen Yougong's letter published in the People's Daily on July 10th, I am writing to you about the warehouse repair situation at our company, as material for this discussion.

    Part of our company's warehouse has had a crack since we occupied it, and part of the warehouse roof is not strong, both of which leak every rainy season. After surveying and designing by Comrade Zheng from Datong City Yuansheng Construction Company, it was deemed necessary to use galvanized iron sheets to nail over the cracks and use white lime to repair the unstable warehouse roof. Therefore, we contracted the entire project to the company for a price of 9 million yuan, and it officially started in May of this year (1951). During the repair process, Comrade Zheng, without going through the Yuansheng Company's manager, proposed to our company's supervisor to use oil felt and white lime instead of galvanized iron sheets. At that time, our company's supervisor agreed to him without going through the leading cadres. I went to inspect the work twice during the repair. However, because the ladder was short, I did not go up to the roof. The third time I went up to the roof to inspect, it was already completed. I poked the oil felt with my finger and a big hole broke through. After completion, it still leaked as usual the first time it rained.

    After discovering that the modification was inappropriate, I immediately proposed to the supervisor and technician Comrade Zheng that it must be repaired according to the original plan. At this time, the person in charge of Yuansheng Company added another layer of old galvanized iron sheets.

    The warehouse roof still leaked the first time it rained after completion. After leaking for a whole day, I called the company that night and asked them to repair it quickly. The company's comrade replied: "Comrade Zheng is drunk tonight, let's talk about it tomorrow!" But it was raining non-stop day and night, and the warehouse was leaking, how could the person in charge sleep? So, they sent storage and transportation cadres to watch the warehouse, and moved the goods away from where the water was leaking. This is how we spent two whole rainy days. After urging for more than ten days, they finally repaired it.

    As a result, Yuansheng Company lost money due to rework. (The amount exceeding the original planned expenditure was not specifically told to our company). Our company reduced the service life of the warehouse due to insufficient inspection. In short, more of the people's money was spent, less was done for the people, and it was not done well.

    This repair work was not urgent, there were many technicians, and there was no shortage of materials. What is the reason? It is because the technical personnel and supervisors did not have a serious enough attitude of being responsible to the people, and the technology was not combined with politics. Therefore, the people's cause was not well served.

### 我们修补库房返工浪费  时间不急材料也不缺乏  只因有关人员不够负责

    我们修补库房返工浪费
    时间不急材料也不缺乏
    只因有关人员不够负责编辑同志：
    我读了人民日报七月十日所载陈有功同志的信以后，将我公司修补仓库情形写给你们，作为这次讨论的一个材料。
    我们公司的库房，一部是从我们占用以来就有一道裂缝，一部库顶不坚固，两者每年雨季滴水。经大同市源盛建筑公司郑同志勘测设计，认为必须用洋铁叶钉苫裂缝，用白灰弥修不固的库房顶。因此，我们就以九百万元计价，将全部工程交该公司包修，于今（一九五一）年五月份正式动工。在修工过程中，郑同志不通过源盛公司经理，擅自向我公司监工人提出不用洋铁叶，以油毡及白灰代替。当时，我公司监工人也未通过领导干部就同意他了。在修此工时，我两次去检查。但因梯子矮，未上房去。三次上房检查，已经竣工了。我用手指将油毡一突，破了一个大窟窿。竣工后，头次下雨就还是照常漏水。
    我发现改修工程不当后，即向监工人及技术人员郑同志提出，必须按原计划重修。此时，源盛公司负责人就另加钉了一层旧洋铁叶。
    库房顶竣工后，头次下雨也漏水了。漏了一白天后，到晚上我给该公司打电话，让他们急速修补。该公司同志答复说：“郑同志今晚喝酒醉了等明天再说吧！”但昼夜不停地下着雨，仓库漏着水，负责人那里能睡觉？就派了储运干部看库，水漏到那里，将商品搬离开那里。这样度过两整天的下雨天。催了十余天，才给补修了。
    结果，源盛公司因做返工活赔钱了。（超过原计划用款的数字未具体告诉我公司）我公司因检查不周，库房使用年限减少了。总之，人民的钱花多了，给人民办事少了，而且还未办好。
    这次修工，时间不急，技术人员不少，材料也不缺乏。原因在那里呢？就是因为技术人员和监工人认真对人民负责的态度不够，技术未与政治结合。因此，就没有把人民的事业办好。
