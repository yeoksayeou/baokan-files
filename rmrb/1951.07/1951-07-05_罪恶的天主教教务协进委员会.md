　　The Sinister Catholic Central Bureau

The Catholic Central Bureau, which has long led reactionary activities within the Catholic Church, has recently been ordered by the Shanghai Military Control Commission to cease its activities and await handling by the People's Government.

The Catholic Central Bureau is located at 179 Yueyang Road, Shanghai. Its predecessor was the Catholic Education Association. In 1947, the notorious imperialist Riberi, in view of the rapid development of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, and to adapt to the "extraordinary period, as instructed by Rome (Vatican)," reorganized and established the Catholic Central Bureau. Under the direct leadership of Riberi, the Catholic Central Bureau printed and distributed a large number of reactionary books and periodicals, and directed the Catholic reactionary organizations "Catholic Action Corps" and "Legion of Mary" to carry out counter-revolutionary activities.

The first Secretary-General of the Catholic Central Bureau was the American imperialist Migeaqi, who was known for his anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance. This person in charge of the Catholic Welfare Committee, which specialized in distributing surplus American relief materials, abandoned his position as Secretary-General and fled Shanghai on the eve of Shanghai's liberation. He was succeeded by another American imperialist, Huali Zhu. Huali Zhu was a confidant of Bishop Spellman, a defender of Wall Street's interests. Under Riberi's command, Huali Zhu turned the Catholic Central Bureau into an even more stubborn reactionary fortress. Reactionary books and periodicals such as "Modern Problems Series," "Chinese Missionaries," and "Missionary Study Materials" were published in large quantities at this time. It was not until after the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea that Huali Zhu, intimidated by the power of the Chinese people's patriotic movement, "retired" and was replaced by Zhao Yuming, a Canadian overseas Chinese. In January of this year, after the Central People's Government promulgated the Measures for the Registration of Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Accepting Foreign Subsidies and Foreign Investment, the Catholic Central Bureau, in order to conceal its reactionary face, changed its Secretary-General to Shen Shixian, a Chinese national completely controlled by American imperialists. However, imperialist elements such as Tian Zhizhong, Huali Zhu, Zhao Yuming, Kang Le (Belgian), Mu Qimeng (French), Fu Mengbi (Belgian), Mo Keqin (Irish, currently the head of the Legion of Mary) and American running dog Chen Zhemin (Chinese) were still hiding in the Catholic Central Bureau, continuing to carry out reactionary activities. They intensified their efforts to publish and distribute reactionary books and periodicals such as "Learning Reference Materials," "Holy and Catholic Church," "The Samadhi of Missionary Work," "A Word on Missionary Work," "Two Gains in Missionary Work" and reactionary comic strips.

The reactionary books and periodicals disseminated by the Catholic Central Bureau went to great lengths to slander, provoke, and intimidate the Chinese people, the People's Government, and the Catholic Church's Three-Self Reform Movement. In the book "The Samadhi of Missionary Work," imperialist elements openly opposed Chinese Catholics loving their motherland, and wanted them to "dismantle the altar of the 'Motherland' god in public without hesitation." In order to blur the national consciousness of Chinese Catholics, imperialist elements made shameful distortions of Chinese history. In the book "A Simple Explanation of Catholicism," they described the British invasion of China in the Opium War as "Lin Zexu launching the Opium War." In the long article "The History of the Development of Catholic Affairs in Shanghai," they slandered the arrival of every revolutionary high tide in Chinese history as a "dark age." They falsely accused the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's Li Xiucheng's troops' attack on Shanghai as an "invasion," and praised the British and French imperialists for "defending Shanghai" and the traitor Zeng Guofan for "joining forces with Gordon's Ever Victorious Army to purge Shanghai."

Imperialists extremely hated the Three-Self Reform Movement initiated by patriotic Catholics, and they tried every possible means to sabotage it. The Catholic Central Bureau was the command organ for carrying out this sabotage activity. In the reactionary books and periodicals issued by the association, they repeatedly disseminated the smoke screen that Catholicism is "transnational," "trans-class," "trans-political," and "trans-regime," to cover up the imperialist use of religion to invade our country, and to defend the Vatican, the tool of American imperialism; at the same time, they used another set of "Three-Self meanings" to distort and slander the real Three-Self Reform Movement, and used "schism" and "violation of doctrine and canon" to threaten patriotic Catholics, and used "harming the transcendence of the church" to prevent Catholics from participating in all patriotic activities.

The Catholic Central Bureau not only carried out reactionary propaganda through writing, but also sent people to various places to sabotage the Three-Self Reform Movement. For example, last winter, Riberi's private secretary, Chen Zhemin, one of the heads of the Central Bureau, went to Beijing in an attempt to sabotage the Three-Self Reform Movement, which was proceeding smoothly in Beijing at that time. The Tianjin imperialist Wen Guibin also sent a special person to Nanjing and Shanghai to consult Riberi and the Catholic Central Bureau, seeking ways to sabotage the Catholic Reform Movement in Tianjin.

The reactionary truth of the Catholic Central Bureau has been completely exposed in front of the Chinese people, and the broad masses of the people and patriotic Catholics can no longer tolerate its continued existence. The order of the Shanghai Military Control Commission is a correct measure based on the wishes of the people, in order to defend national sovereignty and protect freedom of religious belief. Representatives of fifty universities, middle schools, and hospital personnel, including Shanghai Aurora University, issued a declaration on the 14th, demanding the dissolution of the Catholic Central Bureau, and the review of all books and periodicals published by the association, and the banning of all reactionary books. Many readers also wrote articles in the Shanghai Liberation Daily, exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Catholic Central Bureau.

The doomsday of the Catholic Central Bureau, like its commander Riberi, has arrived.

### 罪恶的天主教教务协进委员会

　　罪恶的天主教教务协进委员会
    长期领导天主教内反动活动的天主教教务协进委员会，已于最近被上海市军事管制委员会下令停止活动，听候人民政府处理。
    天主教教务协进委员会设上海市岳阳路一七九号。它的前身是天主教教育联合会。一九四七年，臭名远扬的帝国主义分子黎培里，鉴于中国人民革命胜利形势的迅速发展，为适应“非常时期，经罗马（梵蒂冈）指示”，改组成立了天主教教务协进委员会。在黎培里直接领导下，天主教教务协进委员会印发了大批反动书刊，并指挥着天主教反动组织“公教行动队”及“圣母御侍团”进行反革命活动。
    天主教教务协进委员会的第一任秘书长，是以反苏反共闻名的美帝国主义分子米家琦。这个专门发放美国剩余救济物资的天主教福利委员会的负责人，在上海解放前夕，丢下秘书长的职位，逃离了上海。继任的是另一个美帝国主义分子华理柱。华理柱是美国华尔街利益的维护者史贝尔曼主教的亲信。在黎培里指挥下，华理柱把天主教教务协进委员会变成一个更顽固的反动堡垒。反动书刊如《现代问题丛书》、《中国传教士》、《传教士学习资料》等，便在这时大量出版。直到美国发动侵朝战争以后，华理柱慑于中国人民爱国运动的威力而“隐退”，由加拿大侨民赵玉明接任了他的职务。今年一月，中央人民政府颁布了接受外国津贴及外资经营的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的登记办法之后，天主教教务协进委员会为掩盖它的反动面目，其秘书长改由完全为美帝国主义者所控制的中国人沈士贤出任。但帝国主义分子田执中、华理柱、赵玉明、康乐（比籍）、穆启蒙（法籍）、傅梦弼（比籍）、莫克勤（爱尔兰籍，现为圣母军负责人）及美国走狗陈哲敏（中国籍）等，依然隐藏在天主教教务协进委员会内，继续进行反动活动。他们变本加厉地大批出版和分发了《学习参考资料》《圣而公教会》、《传教三昧》、《传教一言》、《传教两得》等反动书刊和反动的连环图画。
    天主教教务协进委员会所散布的反动书刊，对中国人民、对人民政府、对天主教的三自革新运动，极尽诬蔑、挑拨、威吓之能事。在《传教三昧》一书中，帝国主义分子公然反对中国天主教徒热爱祖国，而要他们把“‘祖国’大神的祭坛，毫不迟疑的当众拆毁”。为了模糊中国教徒的民族意识，帝国主义分子对中国历史作了可耻的曲解。他们在《天主教浅说》一书中，把英国侵略中国的鸦片战争，说成是“林则徐发动鸦片战争”。在《上海天主教教务发展史》的长文中，又将历史上中国人民每一个革命高潮的到来，都诬蔑为“黑暗时代”。他们把太平天国李秀成部队向上海的进攻，诬称为“侵入”，颂扬着英法帝国主义“保卫了上海”，和汉奸曾国藩“联合戈登所率领的常胜军，肃清了上海”。
    帝国主义极端仇视爱国天主教徒所兴起的三自革新运动，他们想尽千方百计进行破坏。天主教教务协进委员会就是进行这一破坏活动的指挥机关。在该会所发出的反动书刊中，一再散布所谓天主教是“超国际”、“超阶级”、“超政治”、“超政权”的烟幕，为帝国主义利用宗教侵略我国作掩护，为美帝国主义的工具梵蒂冈作辩护；同时又以另外一套“三自意义”来曲解和诬蔑真正的三自革新运动，并以“裂教”和“违反教义和教规”恐吓爱国教徒，以“妨害教会的超然性”来阻止教徒参加一切爱国活动。
    天主教教务协进委员会不但通过文字来进行反动宣传，并派人到各地破坏三自革新运动。如去年冬天，黎培里的私人秘书、教务协进委员会负责人之一的陈哲敏到了北京，企图破坏当时北京正在顺利进行的三自革新运动。天津市帝国主义分子文贵宾也曾派专人到南京、上海请教黎培里和天主教教务协进委员会，求取破坏天津市天主教革新运动之道。
    天主教教务协进委员会的反动真相，已在中国人民面前暴露无遗，广大人民以及爱国的天主教徒已不能容忍它的继续存在。上海市军事管制委员会的命令，正是根据人民的愿望，为了保卫祖国主权，保障宗教信仰自由的正确措施。上海震旦大学等五十个大中学校单位代表和医院人员于十四日发出宣言，要求解散天主教教务协进委员会，并审查该会所出版的一切书刊，查禁一切反动书籍。很多读者也纷纷在上海解放日报撰文，揭露天主教教务协进委员会的反革命罪行。
    天主教教务协进委员会象它的指挥者黎培里一样，末日是已经到来了。
