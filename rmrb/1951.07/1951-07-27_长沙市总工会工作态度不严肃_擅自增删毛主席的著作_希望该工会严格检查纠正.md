    Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions Displays a Non-Serious Attitude
    Arbitrarily Adding and Deleting Chairman Mao's Works
    Hope the Federation of Trade Unions Will Strictly Inspect and Correct Editor:
    Recently, the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions, due to the urgent need for learning materials by union members, reprinted Chairman Mao's article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and unexpectedly added and deleted content arbitrarily, committing a serious political error.
    For example, on page four, line one, "People's Republic" was arbitrarily prefixed with "led by the working class"; the sentence on page eight, line one, "the historical task of completely eliminating classes and entering the Great Harmony," was also added by them; lines nine and ten on the same page, "But we will never forgive their reactionary behavior, and never allow their reactionary behavior to have the possibility of free expression," completely contradicts the original text. The original text is "But this is what we forcibly impose on people who were originally hostile classes, and cannot be compared with our self-education work within the revolutionary people"; on page four, line six, "for a while" is a misprint for "to the point of making"; on page six, line one, "if there is no" is mistakenly printed as "especially as far as we are concerned"; on page nine, the three sentences after the original text "compatible with" are completely omitted.
    In total, there are eight instances of arbitrarily added text in the book, two instances of entire sentences and multiple sentences being completely changed and omitted, one hundred and thirty-five punctuation errors, nine instances of two or more but less than ten characters being wrong in a sentence, two instances of not being divided into paragraphs when they should be, sixteen instances of arbitrarily added single characters, and twenty-seven instances of omitted single characters. It can be seen that the errors in the book are serious.
    I hope you will publish my letter to draw the attention of the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions and other departments that compile and print document-like books and periodicals.
                Hu Chu
    Editor's Note: The irresponsible work style reflected in this letter from the Changsha City Federation of Trade Unions regarding reprinting work is indeed extremely serious. The federation of trade unions should conduct strict inspection and correction. The book that has already been sent out must also be completely recalled. This lesson should arouse the serious attention of publishing houses or organizations that compile and print or reprint document-like works.

### 长沙市总工会工作态度不严肃　擅自增删毛主席的著作  希望该工会严格检查纠正

　  长沙市总工会工作态度不严肃
  　擅自增删毛主席的著作
    希望该工会严格检查纠正编辑同志：
    长沙市总工会最近因工会会员急需学习资料，翻印了毛主席的《论人民民主专政》一文，竟把内容擅加增删，犯了严重的政治错误。
    例如第四页第一行“人民共和国”上擅加“工人阶级领导的”；第八页第一行“完全消灭阶级和进入大同的历史任务”一句，也是他们加上去的；同页第九——十行“但我们绝不宽恕他们的反动行为，绝不让他们的反动行为有自由发挥的可能性”，和原文完全不符。原文是“但这是我们对于原来是敌对阶级的人们所强迫施行的，和我们对于革命人民内部的自我教育工作不能相提并论”；四页六行的“一时候”是“以至使”之误；六页一行把“假如没有”错印成“对于我们说来特别是”；第九页把原文“相符合的”之下的三句完全脱落。
    总计该书中有擅加文字的八处，整句和数句文字完全改变和脱落的二处，标点错误一百三十五处，一句中错二字以上十字以下的九处，应分段而未分段的二处，擅加单字的十六处，脱落单字的二十七处。可见该书错误的严重。
    希望你们把我的来信发表，以引起长沙市总工会及其他编印文件性书刊的部门的注意。
              胡础
    编者按：这封来信所反映长沙市总工会翻印工作的不负责任的作风，实在异常严重。该工会应进行严格检查纠正。已经发出的该书也必须全部收回。这个教训，应该引起编印或翻印文件性的著作的出版社或机关的严重的注意。
