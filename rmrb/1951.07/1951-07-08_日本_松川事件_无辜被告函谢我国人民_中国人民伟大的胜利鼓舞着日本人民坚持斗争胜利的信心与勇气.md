　　Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" Innocent Defendants Thank Chinese People
    The Great Victory of the Chinese People Encourages the Japanese People's Confidence and Courage to Persist in the Struggle for Victory
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Saito Chi, an innocent defendant in the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident," representing all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" – twenty Japanese patriots – sent a letter to all the Chinese people, expressing their gratitude for the Chinese people's support in their struggle against persecution. The letter was written on May 13th at the Miyagi Prison in Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The following is an excerpt:
    To all the workers of New China! All patriotic people!
    We twenty people were sentenced on December 6th of last year for fighting for world peace, national independence, and the thorough implementation of the Potsdam Proclamation. We are deeply grateful for the great encouragement you have given us with your profound friendship. We vow to persevere in our fighting spirit until we achieve victory.
    Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese People's Relief Administration took the lead in supporting us at the beginning of 1951, we have received more than 1,000 letters and messages of encouragement from the Chinese people to this day. In these letters, we can see that you are carrying out a great patriotic movement under the slogan of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation." No matter what circumstances we are placed in, in order to respond to your support, we always remember: we must overthrow the aggressors, defend peace and independence, and fight to the end for this.
    The United States has recently re-stationed two divisions in the Tohoku region and Hokkaido in Japan. They have established a headquarters in Sendai. The prison is also heavily guarded, with dozens of automatic rifles in addition to pistols and batons. However, cannons and atomic bombs, prisons and gallows, cannot strangle the truth. The victory of the people of the great New China is glorious and immortal. This great victory, which you have won with your blood, gives the Japanese people infinite and powerful encouragement to their courage and confidence in victory.
    We do not dream of leaving the prison to be beasts of burden again. As long as we have a breath left, we must persist in living on and strive to defend truth, peace, and independence.
    Although we have been deprived of the freedom to move outside the prison, we will write letters, compose poems, write songs, and write articles. We consider writing letters as one of the important struggles in prison. Therefore, under haggard circumstances, the first joint of the middle finger of the right hand has been worn into a hard callus. Comrades take advantage of the dim light to study, and eleven comrades have begun to study Russian on their own. This study is constantly advancing due to the encouragement of comrades outside the prison.
    We twenty people have been influenced by your great struggle. Although we are in prison, we have not wavered in the slightest, and we can increase our courage and consolidate our confidence day by day. This is a supreme joy as a human being and as a communist, and we deeply feel that the happiness of struggle lies here.
    The enemy wants to imprison us to separate us from you, to isolate us, to make us pessimistic and disappointed, and to prostrate ourselves before money. This conspiracy has completely failed.
    The enemy intends to start our second trial in September. Why choose September? You are very clear. The imperialists have clamored that they must forcibly complete the preparation for war and the separate peace treaty to enslave the Japanese people and rearm Japan before August. The separate peace treaty will keep Japan in a state of war with the Soviet Union and China. The imperialists attempt to use this to cut off the support that the Soviet Union and you have given to the Japanese people, isolate the Japanese people, turn them into cannon fodder, and satisfy their ambitions. The twenty of us will also be sent to the gallows. Therefore, striving for a comprehensive peace, opposing rearmament, and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all occupying forces are not only important struggles for all the Japanese people, but also extremely important struggles for the people of all Asia and the world. We will use all our strength to confidently call on all people in the country who love peace and truth to strive for a comprehensive peace, oppose rearmament, and demand the withdrawal of all occupying forces.
    Justice will surely triumph, truth will surely triumph, and the peace-loving people will surely defeat the bloodsucking demons of war. We are willing to dedicate our lives for peace and independence, truth and justice. We believe that being led in struggle by the great Comrade Stalin, the first standard-bearer of world peace and the leader of the people of the world, and the great Comrade Mao Zedong, the second standard-bearer of world peace and the leader of the people of all Asia, is a supreme pride and glory.
    We wholeheartedly wish good health to our friends fighting in Korea for the anti-aggression war, and express our deep condolences to the friends who have donated their lives for this struggle, and extend our condolences and encouragement to their families.

    Note: The so-called "Matsukawa Incident" was a planned fabrication by the American and Japanese reactionaries to frame the Japanese Communist Party and patriotic workers. The incident occurred on August 17, 1949, when a train derailed and overturned near Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture because road rail nails were pulled out. The reactionaries used this to arrest a total of twenty Japanese communists and patriotic workers, and on December 6th of last year, the Fukushima District Court unreasonably sentenced five innocent defendants, including Suzuki Nobu, to death, five people, including Takeda Hisashi, to life imprisonment, and ten people, including Saito Chi, to a total of 95 and a half years in prison.

　　日本“松川事件”无辜被告函谢我国人民
    中国人民伟大的胜利鼓舞着日本人民坚持斗争胜利的信心与勇气
    【新华社讯】日本“松川事件”的无辜被告斋藤千，代表“松川事件”全体被告——二十名日本爱国者，致函全体中国人民，对中国人民对他们的反迫害斗争的声援，表示谢意。该信在五月十三日写于日本宫城县仙台市宫城监狱，摘要如下：
    新中国的全体工人们！一切爱国人民们！
    我们二十个人是在去年十二月六日，为了争取世界和平、民族独立、彻底实现波茨坦公告进行斗争而被判刑的。承蒙你们以深厚的友情给我们很大的鼓励。我们感激落泪，誓必坚持斗志，直到获得胜利为止。
    自从一九五一年初，中华全国总工会和中国人民救济总会带头给我们以声援以来，一直到今天，我们已经收到中国人民的信和鼓励书共一千多件。在这些信件里，我们可以看出你们在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的口号之下，进行着伟大的爱国主义运动。我们无论被置于何等境地，为了回答你们的支援，我们始终铭记着：必须打倒侵略者、保卫和平和独立，并为此而斗争到底。
    美国最近重新派遣二个师驻扎在日本东北地区和北海道。他们在仙台设立了司令部。监狱里也是戒备森严，除了备有手枪、棍棒之外，还有数十枝自动步枪。但是，大炮和原子弹，监狱和绞刑台，都不能绞杀真理。伟大的新中国的人民的胜利是光荣的，不朽的。你们用鲜血所取得的这个伟大的胜利，对日本人民的勇气和胜利的信心，给以无限的有力的鼓舞。
    我们并不梦想由牢狱里出去再作牛马。我们只要一息尚存，一定要坚持地活下去，为保卫真理、和平、独立而奋斗。
    我们虽然被剥夺了在狱外活动的自由，但是我们会写信、作诗、作歌和写文章。我们拿写信当做重要的狱中斗争之一。因此，在形容憔悴的情况之下，右手的中指第一节都磨成了硬茧。同志们利用暗澹的光线，进行学习，并有十一名同志开始在自学俄文。这些学习，由于狱外同志的鼓舞，在不断努力地前进着。
    我们二十个人受了你们伟大的斗争的影响，虽然身在狱中，都丝毫没有动摇，而且能日益增强勇气和巩固信心，这是做人和做共产党员的一件无上的高兴的事情，我们深切地感到斗争的幸福也就在这里。
    敌人把我们关在监狱里，想要使我们和你们分离开，使我们陷于孤立、悲观失望，拜倒于金元之前，这个阴谋是完全失败了。
    敌人想自九月起对我们作第二审。为什么选中九月呢？你们是十分明了的。帝国主义者扬言在八月以前定要强制完成准备战争和奴役日本人民的单独媾和与重新武装日本。单独媾和将使日本与苏联和中国保持战争状态，帝国主义者企图借此继绝苏联和你们所给予日本人民的支援，而使日本人民孤立起来，变成炮灰，满足他们的野心。我们二十个人，也就断送在绞刑台上。因此，争取全面媾和、反对重新武装、要求全体占领军立即撤退，不仅仅是全体日本人民的重要斗争，就全亚洲、全世界人民来说，也是极其重要的斗争。我们要用全力充满信心地向全国爱好和平和真理的人们号召，争取全面媾和，反对重新武装，要求全部占领军撤退。
    正义一定胜利，真理一定胜利，和平的人民一定战胜战争的吸血魔王。我们愿为和平和独立、真理和正义献出我们的生命。我们认为，被世界和平的第一旗手、全世界人民的领袖伟大的斯大林同志和世界和平第二旗手、全亚洲人民的领袖伟大的毛泽东同志所领导进行着斗争，是无上的骄傲和光荣。
    我们衷心祝福在朝鲜为反侵略战争而奋斗的朋友的健康，并对为这个斗争而捐献生命的朋友们表示深深的哀悼，对其家属致以慰问和鼓励。
    按：所谓“松川事件”是美、日反动派有计划地制造的，用来陷害日本共产党和爱国工人。事件发生在一九四九年八月十七日，有一列火车在福岛县松川车站附近因路轨道钉被拔而脱轨颠覆，列车乘务员三人死亡。反动派借此逮捕了日本共产党员和爱国工人共二十名，并在去年十二月六日由福岛地方裁判所无理判处无辜被告铃木信等五人死刑，武田久等五人无期徒刑，斋藤千等十人共九十五年半的徒刑。
