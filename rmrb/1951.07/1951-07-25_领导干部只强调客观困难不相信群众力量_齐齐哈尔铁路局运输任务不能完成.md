Leading Cadres Only Emphasize Objective Difficulties and Don't Believe in the Strength of the Masses
　　Qiqihar Railway Bureau Fails to Complete Transportation Tasks
    The leading cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau only emphasize objective difficulties and do not value the creative experiences of the masses in overcoming difficulties, and therefore cannot complete transportation tasks.

    On May 5th this year, the Suihua Station of the bureau dispatched a train of empty cars to the Nancha area. It was originally planned to gradually drop off the 22 flat cars of this empty train loaded with timber at various stations along the way. However, because the flat cars were mixed with open cars loaded with coal, it took several more procedures to drop off the cars, which would inevitably lengthen the stop time at the intermediate stations and disrupt the operation plan. Therefore, this empty train had to run to the terminal station without dropping off the cars. The flat cars were not used in Nancha, and 22 cars of timber along the way were not loaded. Similar situations of having cars but not loading goods happen from time to time within the jurisdiction of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau. In May, the bureau wasted 23,941 car hours due to train delays, which is equivalent to 990 freight cars not being used.

    On the one hand, useful freight cars are being wasted; on the other hand, fewer cars are loaded due to insufficient freight cars; but the leading cadres of the bureau have not tried to reduce and eliminate the waste of freight cars, but only feel that there are too few freight cars to complete the task. For example, in May, the eastern coastal area within the bureau's jurisdiction needed a large number of empty cars to transport coal and timber and other major materials, and there were not enough empty cars for short distances; while the western area had many heavy cars and many empty cars after unloading, but they could not be transported out. Because to transport the main materials in the east, it was necessary to send the empty cars in the west to the east via Beian, which wasted time, and more than 2,000 fewer cars of goods were loaded in May alone. At this time, some employees thought, "If the empty cars run fast and arrive early, can't we load more cars in the same way?" On May 22nd, Tang Qingren, a dispatcher from the bureau, created methods such as ordering "oral contracts" and mutual guarantees in order to make the empty cars run faster and shorten the running time, mobilizing the relevant employees: the driver guarantees to run fast, and the station guarantees to reduce unnecessary stopping time, so that the train can pass without delay. On the same day, the 2509th empty train from Suihua to Beian arrived 3 hours and 35 minutes early. It stopped for 14 minutes to change locomotives and then immediately drove to Suihua. The running time and stopping time were shortened, saving a total of 4 hours and 41 minutes, shortening the running time by more than 46%. This is equivalent to the empty train traveling more than 100 kilometers less. The "objective difficulty" that affected loading due to too much travel distance was overcome by Tang Qingren's method. However, the responsible comrades of the bureau did not pay attention to Tang Qingren's creation, and the dispatchers generally did not know what this working method was all about. Tang Qingren's good way to improve work was thus shelved. He said: "The leaders are very concerned about the transportation situation, and they come to see the train operation chart almost every day. When they see that the trains between Qiqihar and Beian take a long time and the empty cars cannot be sent up, they shake their heads. But they rarely study with us."

    In mid-June, the Northeast Railway held a transportation conference and strictly criticized the erroneous thinking of the leading cadres of various bureaus for only emphasizing objective difficulties and neglecting the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. At the same time, it required all bureaus to vigorously reverse the situation of failing to complete transportation tasks in the past few months. However, the leading cadres of the bureau still believed that "our basic problem is not that there are many cars, but that there are not enough cars." Under the control of this idea of emphasizing objective difficulties, they neglected the rational allocation of vehicles, resulting in too many vehicles being squeezed, causing the operation to be out of sync. From June 21st to 25th, 117 trains were still delayed for five days.

    At this time, many employees of the bureau were responding to the call of the Northeast Railway Transportation Conference and actively taking action. For example, the employees of Cuiluan and Yichun stations on the Tanglin line and the cargo owners jointly organized a joint loading and unloading competition committee. The cargo owners took the initiative to put forward the slogan "eliminate loading when it's windy, loading when it's raining, and loading at night." Assist the railway in completing the loading task together. On the 28th, cargo owners at Cuiluan Station and local railway employees worked together in the rain to load 12 cars of timber ahead of schedule, allowing the train to depart 70 minutes earlier. Dispatcher Zhang Heling was also always thinking: "Everyone is responding to the call of the transportation conference to reverse the transportation situation, and I can't fall behind!" At the morning shift meeting on June 28th, the cargo dispatcher in charge of directing the loading and unloading of goods proposed: "The 933rd heavy car from Suihua to the north every day is always unable to unload the cars after arriving at the station due to the tight time, and empty cars cannot be freed up for use that day. As long as the traffic dispatcher (who directs the operation of the train) guarantees to arrive 30 minutes early, we can unload the cars on the same day and free up the empty cars for use." The 933rd heavy car was commanded by Zhang Heling. They immediately signed an oral contract on the spot, with one party guaranteeing early arrival and the other party guaranteeing unloading. In order to realize this contract, the employees, drivers, and cargo owners related to the operation of the 933rd train put forward their own guarantee conditions and were involved in a tense battle. The collective strength enabled the 933rd heavy car to arrive at Beian one hour and twenty minutes ahead of schedule. After passing through 16 stations, 11 stations did not stop because of good prior contact, saving stopping time and shortening travel time by more than 39%.

    Other dispatchers saw Zhang Heling's vivid facts of finding ways to improve work and took the initiative to learn from them, setting off a climax of joint labor. On June 30th alone, four typical examples of Zhang Heling-style shortening of travel time appeared.

    However, the leaders of the bureau did not pay attention to Zhang Heling's creation, but thought that creative working methods like Zhang Heling and Tang Qingren were "daily work," and there was no experience worthy of attention, nor was there a working method worthy of promotion. But they failed to complete the task, and said, "We have objective difficulties."

### 领导干部只强调客观困难不相信群众力量  齐齐哈尔铁路局运输任务不能完成

　　领导干部只强调客观困难不相信群众力量
　  齐齐哈尔铁路局运输任务不能完成
    齐齐哈尔铁路管理局领导干部只强调客观困难，不重视群众克服困难的创造性的经验，因而不能完成运输任务。
    今年五月五日，该局绥化车站开出一列到南叉方面去的空车。原来准备在沿途各站陆续甩下该列空车的二十二个平板车装木材。但是因为把平板车和装煤的敞车掺混编在一起了，甩车时要多费几道手续，势必拖长在中间站的停留时间，打乱运行计划。所以这列空车只好一直开到终点站不能甩车。平板车停在南叉用不上，沿途二十二车木材也没装成。类似这样有车装不上货的情形，在齐齐哈尔铁路管理局管内不时发生。五月份该局因为列车晚点就浪费了两万三千九百四十一个车小时，等于九百九十个车皮没有用。
    一方面在浪费着有用的车皮；另一方面又因车皮不足少装了车；但该局领导干部却没有设法减少与消灭车皮的浪费，只觉得车皮少，完不成任务。譬如：五月份该局管内东部沿线地区需要大批空车运煤和木材等主要物资，近处去的空车不够用；而西部却因重车多，卸后空车也多，但运不出来。因为要运出东部的主要物资，势必要把西部空车经北安绕道送到东部，因而浪费时间，五月一个月内即少装了两千多车货物。这时，部分员工想：“如果空车走的快，到的早，不是同样可以多装车吗？”五月二十二日，该局调度员唐庆仁为使空车走的快，缩短运行时间，便创造了订“口头合同”互相保证等办法，把有关的员工都动员起来：司机保证走的快，车站保证减少不必要的停车时间，使列车通过不耽误。当天从绥化开往北安的二五○九次空车，早到三点三十五分，停了十四分钟换机车后立即又开往绥化。运行时间和停车时间都缩短了，总共比平时节省了四点四十一分钟，缩短走行时间百分之四十六强。等于这列空车少走了一百多公里。因为走路太远而影响装车的“客观困难”，被唐庆仁的办法战胜了。但是，该局负责同志对于唐庆仁这样的创造未加过问，调度员普遍不知道这种工作方法是怎么回事。唐庆仁改进工作的好办法就这样被搁起来了。他说：“领导上很关心运输情况，差不多每天都来看列车运行图，看见齐齐哈尔到北安间列车走的时间长，空车送不上去，就晃头。但是他们却很少和我们在一起研究过。”
    六月中旬，东北铁路召开运输会议时，曾严格地批评了各管理局领导干部只强调客观困难，忽视群众的积极性和创造性等错误思想。同时要求各局大力扭转几个月来完不成运输任务的局面。但是该局领导干部还认为“我们的基本问题不是车多，而是车不够”，在这种强调客观困难思想支配下，忽视合理调配车辆，以致车辆多挤住了，使运行失调。六月二十一日到二十五日五天中依然有一百一十七个列车晚点。
    这时，该局很多员工都在响应东北铁路运输会议的号召，积极行动起来。如汤林线上的翠峦、宜春等站的员工和货主共同组织了联合装卸竞赛委员会。货主主动提出“消灭刮风不装、下雨不装、黑天不装”的口号。协助铁路共同完成装车任务。二十八日翠峦站货主和当地铁路员工共同冒着大雨提前装完十二车木材使列车早开七十分钟。调度员张鹤龄也总在想：“大家都在响应运输会议的号召，扭转运输情况，我也不能落后呵！”在六月二十八日早晨交班会上，指挥装、卸货的货运调度员提出：“每天从绥化开往北去的九三三次重车，总是因为到站后时间紧，卸不完车，当天腾不出空车来用。只要行车调度（指挥列车运行）保证早到三十分钟，我们就可以当天卸完，腾出空车用。”九三三次重车正是张鹤龄指挥。他们便当场订了口头合同，一方保证早到，一方保证卸车。为了实现这个合同，与九三三次列车运行有关的员工、司机、货主都提出自己的保证条件，卷入了紧张的战斗中。集体的力量使九三三次重车终于提前一点二十分到北安。途中经过十六个站，有十一个站因为事先联系得好没有停车，节省了停车时间，缩短走行时间达百分之三十九强。
    其他调度员看见张鹤龄想办法改进工作的活生生事实，就主动地学习起来，掀起了联合劳动的高潮。六月三十日一天就出现了四个张鹤龄式缩短走行时间的典型事迹。
    但是，该局领导上对于张鹤龄的创造也不重视，他们却以为像张鹤龄、唐庆仁这样的创造性的工作方法是“日常工作”，没有什么值得重视的经验，也没有值得推广的工作方法。但他们完不成任务，却说：“我们有客观困难。”
