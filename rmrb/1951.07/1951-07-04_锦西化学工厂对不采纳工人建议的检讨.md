    Jinxi Chemical Factory
    Self-Criticism for Not Adopting Workers' Suggestions

    To the Editors:

    After reading Comrade Lin Yincai's letter of criticism of our factory published in the People's Daily on May 9th, we immediately conducted a self-criticism and concluded that: the administrative leaders of our factory have a bureaucratic work style, their work is not thorough, and they do not have a firm grasp of the technology. The circumstances of the matter where we "did not adopt workers' rationalization suggestions," as criticized by Comrade Lin Yincai, are as follows:

    1.  When installing electrolytic cells starting in October last year, we only focused on completing the task and did not master the technology. During the processing of the main carbon electrodes, the chlorine gas treatment was inadequate, the carbon electrodes were oil-saturated, and the diaphragm was partially blocked, resulting in a loss of raw materials.

    2.  Two worker comrades from Qingdao suggested using barium sulfate and a dropper. This suggestion was very reasonable. We did not adopt it immediately at the time because the construction materials had already arrived at the factory (such as talcum powder and glass equipment), and the installation date was approaching, making it inconvenient to rework. In this matter, we demonstrated the following shortcomings: 1. We did not adopt the workers' rationalization suggestions, and although we provided explanations at the time, they were not detailed enough; 2. We yielded to the conditions at the time (the raw materials had already arrived at the factory). We did not recognize these problems beforehand, which shows that we were not serious and responsible enough in our work.

    In addition, regarding Comrade Lin Yincai's criticism, there are a few points that need to be clarified:

    1.  The phenomenon of "constant malfunctions in production, wasting a lot of raw materials, and reducing product quality" is not entirely due to not using barium sulfate and droppers, but mainly because the carbon electrodes were not processed properly.

    2.  Preparations for barium sulfate and droppers were completed before the end of March. The plan to use barium sulfate was proposed in January; droppers were also installed and used gradually starting in March.

### 锦西化学工厂对不采纳工人建议的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    锦西化学工厂
    对不采纳工人建议的检讨编辑同志：
    我们见到五月九日人民日报刊载林殷才同志对本厂的批评信件后，立即进行了一次检讨，认为：我厂行政领导干部有官僚主义的作风，工作不深入，并且没有切实掌握技术。林殷才同志所批评我们“不采纳工人合理化建议”的事情经过是这样的：
    一、去年十月开始按装电槽时，我们只顾完成任务，没有掌握技术，主要的炭精极加工时，氯气处理不良，炭极渗油，隔膜部分堵塞，使原材料受到损失。
    二、青岛来的二位工友，曾建议采用硫酸钡与点滴器，这项建议是很合理的。当时没有立即采用，是因为修建材料都已到厂（如滑石粉玻璃器具等），按装日期迫近，不便反工。在这件事情上我们表现了下列缺点：一、没有采纳工友的合理化建议，当时虽有解释，但不够详细；二、迁就了当时的条件（原材料已经到厂）。我们事先没有认识到这些问题，这就说明我们对工作不够认真负责。
    此外关于林殷才同志的批评，其中有几点需要加以说明：
    一、“生产上不断发生故障，浪费很多原料，使产品质量降低”的现象，这并不完全是由于不采用硫酸钡和点滴器的缘故，主要是因为炭精极加工处理不良。
    二、硫酸钡与点滴器的准备工作，都是在三月下旬以前作完的。采用硫酸钡的计划一月份已提出；点滴器也在三月份开始陆续按装应用。
