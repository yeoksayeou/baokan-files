Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th: The patriotic movement of the people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons continues to move forward. As of the 10th, the number of airplanes decided to be donated in various places has reached 108 (including 2 bombers), as well as 9 cannons, 7 anti-aircraft guns, and 1 tank. Among them, the people of all ethnic groups in Gansu Province decided to donate 44 fighter planes, 1 bomber, 3 anti-aircraft guns, 1 cannon, and 1 tank. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province decided to donate 27 fighter planes and 5 cannons. People from all walks of life in Shaanxi Province decided to donate 16 fighter planes, 1 bomber, 2 cannons, and 3 anti-aircraft guns. The people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia Province decided to donate 4 fighter planes, 1 cannon, and 1 anti-aircraft gun each. The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai decided to donate 3 fighter planes. People from all walks of life in Xi'an City decided to donate 12 fighter planes.

Now, this patriotic movement of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Northwest China has entered the stage of formulating periodic and specific plans for increasing production (or saving) for donations and implementing the plans, from the initial stage of brewing, calling, and enthusiastic donations. The broad masses of workers in Xi'an City have universally proposed to launch a patriotic donation and production increase competition, striving to donate part or all of the extra bonus and wages obtained from processing and dedication of work to airplanes, and ensuring that part of the donation plan is completed before National Day. The plan of the industrial and commercial circles of the city to improve operations, increase income, and donate eight fighter planes is scheduled to be completed in November of this year. The people of Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, completed the plan of donating ten fighter planes formulated by the representatives of all ethnic groups and all circles in the city on the 6th. The vast majority of farmers in the five provinces of Northwest China have also formulated donation plans for increasing cotton and grain production, and the plans of some counties are also planning to be completed before National Day. The Tibetan people in the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region in the Qilian Mountains in Gansu are working hard to increase production from tribes to monasteries, striving to complete the donation of the "Tianzhu Tibetan Nationality" fighter plane during the autumn harvest this year. Lamas and Living Buddhas in Buddhist monasteries in Qinghai have also successively formulated savings and donation plans within six months.

[From this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: Students from Jiangyan Elementary School in Taixian County, northern Jiangsu, wrote to children all over the country, reporting that they have already overfulfilled their June donation plan.

In their letter, they said: After we initiated the donation of the "China Children's" airplane, we successively received letters from children in Liaodong, Jilin, Gansu, Hebei, Hunan, Sichuan, Shandong, Fujian, Beijing, and other places expressing their approval, and these letters encouraged us even more. In June, we donated a total of 306,600 yuan in RMB, more than twice the original plan. In addition to saving candy money, we also used labor lessons and Sundays to make fly swatters and bowl covers, collect broken glass, scrap copper and iron, etc. to sell for money and donate. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, we have decided to organize charity performances during the holidays to donate 200,000 yuan, so as to complete the donation plan of 500,000 yuan within this year as soon as possible, and strive towards the donation goal of 1 million yuan.
