　　Japanese Workers Launch Patriotic Movement
　　Demanding a Comprehensive Peace Treaty
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 30th: TASS Moscow, July 28th—Ximing Heketuofu wrote in Labor Daily: American imperialists are frantically preparing to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. American imperialists need a separate treaty and a planned US-Japan military agreement to prepare for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and to suppress the national liberation movement in Asia. This treaty endangers world peace and subjects the Japanese people to aggression. Therefore, it is not surprising that the movement against re-militarization and against separate peace talks has taken on such a huge scale in Japan.
    The Japanese working class is fighting with particular heroism to defend peace and oppose the American plan to rearm Japan. The large-scale strikes by port workers in Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Moji and other places, and the strikes in military factories in late June, confirmed this.
    It is profoundly significant that Japanese workers call their movement to defend peace and oppose separate peace talks a "patriotic movement." Because the main problems at present are saving national independence and saving the lives of working people who are suffering under the heavy pressure of the arms expansion movement.
    In order to oppose intolerable living conditions and the rearmament of Japan, the Japanese working people are enthusiastically signing declarations demanding a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan including the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. To date, they have collected more than two million signatures, and the number of signatures is constantly increasing. The Japanese masses are uniting their ranks in the struggle for peace, because they know that unity is a guarantee of success.

　　日本工人展开爱国运动
　  要求缔结全面和约
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：西明禾科托夫在劳动报上写道：美帝国主义者正在疯狂地准备着缔结单独对日和约。美帝国主义者需要单独和约和计划好的美日军事协定，来准备侵略苏联和中华人民共和国，并镇压亚洲的民族解放运动。这一个条约危害世界和平，并使日本人民遭受侵略。所以，反对重新军国主义化和反对单独媾和的运动在日本呈现出如此巨大的规模，是不足为奇的事情。
    日本工人阶级以特别英勇的精神为保卫和平与反对美国重新武装日本的计划而斗争。六月底在东京、横滨、神户、门司等地举行的海港工人大罢工和军事工厂的罢工，证实了这一点。
    日本工人把他们的保卫和平与反对单独媾和的运动称为“爱国运动”，这是有深刻的意义的。因为当前主要的问题是挽救民族独立和挽救在扩充军备运动的重压下受难的劳动人民的生命。
    日本劳动人民为了反对不能忍受的生活条件和重新武装日本，正热烈地在要求缔结包括苏联和中华人民共和国在内的全面对日和约的宣言上签名。到现在他们已经征集了二百万个以上的签名，签名人数还在不断增加中。日本人民大众正在团结他们的为和平而斗争的队伍，因为他们知道团结是成功的保证。
