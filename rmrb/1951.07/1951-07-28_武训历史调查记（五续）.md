　　The Historical Investigation of Wu Xun (Continued Five)
  (V) Wu Xun's Land Exploitation
    Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team
    Sun Yu said: Wu Xun was "an ordinary peasant under the oppression of the feudal ruling class" ("Biography of Wu Xun" preface). Li Shizhao said: Wu Xun was "a pioneer of the oppressed peasant class" and a "model laborer" (ibid., main text). Indeed, we can believe that Sun Yu and Li Shizhao's "positions and viewpoints are completely consistent" (ibid., author's preface). Unfortunately, Wu Xun himself contradicted them. "The important deeds of his life" (ibid., main text) simply do not "agree" with what they publicized. Wu Xun was neither an "ordinary peasant," a "model laborer," nor did he belong to the oppressed class. He was a major creditor, a large landlord, and a vicious major creditor and landlord with privileges. Wu Xun's privileges were particularly evident in his land exploitation.
    As far as we know, Wu Xun owned land in Tangyi, Guantao, and Linqing. We didn't have time to investigate whether he had land in other counties. Based on our investigation of these three counties alone, he owned more than 300 mu of land. Tangyi had the most land because he had privileges there and didn't have to pay land taxes. Guo Chunxu, the magistrate of Tangyi County, had reported Wu Xun's land holdings "according to his report, exempting him from silver and grain donations. The superior authority explicitly approved that the silver and grain should be donated by the government, to be a permanent precedent" (Jia Pinzhong: Epitaph for the Benevolent Gentleman Wu). Therefore, we focused our investigation of Wu Xun's land exploitation on Tangyi, with a portion related to Guantao.
    We found a portion of Wu Xun's land purchase contracts, called "Land Accounts," totaling three volumes, all copies of Wu Xun's land purchase contracts over the years. Some of the contracts recorded in these three "Land Accounts" are duplicates. After removing the duplicates, we obtained 74 transactions, totaling over 285 mu of land. These three "Land Accounts" are divided into two large volumes and one small volume. The former were found in the hands of Wu Jinxing, Wu Xun's great-grandnephew in Wuzhuang, Tangyi, and the latter were found in the hands of descendants of Xu Jinzhuan, who had managed Wu Xun's property in Zhaolangzhai, Tangyi. These are all rare historical materials, but unfortunately, the latter is a fragmented copy due to being torn apart.
    Looking at the years listed in these three "Land Accounts," Wu Xun started pawning land as early as age 30 and started buying land at age 41. Initially, it was only one mu or half a mu, a very small amount. By age 42, he began large-scale plunder. In that year alone, he seized over 63 mu of land from 21 peasants. In March alone, he bought land eight times. The following year, he seized over 104 mu of land from 14 peasants. By the age of 55, he became a large landlord owning nearly 300 mu of land. However, this is only based on the written materials we found, and it appears to be only a part, or a major part, but certainly not all of Wu Xun's real estate. For example, according to our investigation, Wu Xun also owned 22 mu, 1 fen, 9 li, 2 hao in Liulin Town. Combined with the numbers in the three Land Accounts, this exceeds 300 mu, totaling 307 mu, 3 fen, 2 li, 4 hao, 6 si.
    Now, based on these three "Land Accounts," the time, method, location, original owner, mu number, and land price of each land acquisition are listed below:
    These lands were mostly taken from peasants by Wu Xun in small amounts by taking advantage of their precarious situations. The number of mu on each contract is mostly only one or two mu, or two or three mu. In the 74 contracts we saw, 38 were for numbers less than 3 mu; only 5 were for more than 10 mu. The fact that Wu Xun acquired such small amounts of land each time proves that they were mostly poor peasants who, facing emergencies and unable to survive, had no choice but to sell their land to Wu Xun. Wu Xun's becoming a large landlord was a gradual accumulation over 29 years (from the age of 30) using various cruel methods.
    The land prices listed in the table vary because the quality of the land differs. A large part of Tangyi is saline-alkali land, which is cheaper. Also, the 0.5505 mu of land bought from Lou Shilin on April 13th of Guangxu year 5 had a purchase price of over 49,000 copper coins because it included houses. Similarly, the 1.75 mu bought from Wu Keqi on December 3rd of Guangxu year 9 had a purchase price of 550,000 copper coins for the same reason – it was a homestead with houses. Wu Xun demolished these two houses and moved the materials to Liulin to build the "righteous school."
    The number of mu listed in the table up to March 1st of Guangxu year 11 totals 228.4885 mu, a number very close to the one listed in Guo Chunxu's initial request for commendation ("The Beginning and End of Establishing the School"). Guo's document states: "By the winter of Guangxu year 12, the total land pawned and bought was 230 mu and some odd, using 4,263 strings and 874 wen of Beijing money." We calculated the price of these 228.4885 mu in the table, and the number is 4,169 strings and 249 wen. Why is it a little smaller than Guo's number? Mainly because the table lacks the land price for 2.7852 mu. If we supplement this land price based on the average price per mu derived from dividing Guo Chunxu's reported land number by the reported total land price, at 18 strings and 500 wen per mu, the price of 2.7852 mu would be 51 strings and 526 wen. Adding this to 4,169 strings and 249 wen, we get 4,220 strings and 775 wen, only 43 strings and 99 wen short of Guo Chunxu's reported number. Guo Chunxu's report was up to the winter of Guangxu year 12, while the 228 mu recorded in the "Land Accounts" is up to March 1st of Guangxu year 11. This one year and nine months difference in time for Wu Xun's land acquisition may be the reason for the difference of 43 strings and 99 wen. Therefore, we can judge that the Land Accounts we obtained up to March of Guangxu year 11 are fairly complete and accurate historical materials. However, the 56.6441 mu of land that Wu Xun continued to acquire from December of Guangxu year 17 to November of year 19, all of which were recorded on the land accounts, have never been reported by the Manchu officials or landlords. Therefore, we suspect that in addition to the so-called school land, Wu Xun had other properties that he may have possessed privately. In addition, the Land Accounts are missing records for six years and nine months, from March 2nd of Guangxu year 11 to February 18th of Guangxu year 17. We also did not find any records of land acquisition for the two years and some months from Guangxu year 20 until Wu Xun's death in Guangxu year 22. The more money Wu Xun accumulated later, the more land he may have bought. So we say that the three Land Accounts we found are only a part or a major part of his real estate, certainly not all of it.
    Wu Xun's viciousness was manifested not only in his usurious lending methods but also in the various ways he seized land from poor peasants. According to our current investigation, the methods he used were as follows:
    1. Peasants borrowed Wu Xun's high-interest loans, and when they couldn't repay them on time, they had to pawn their land to him. This was Wu Xun's main method of initially acquiring land. Zhang Yuchi (29 years old, middle peasant) from Zhongbuzhai's great-grandfather pawned two pieces of land (totaling 6.292 mu) to him because he used Wu Xun's money and couldn't repay it. Tang Qinxin (75 years old, originally a poor peasant, now a new middle peasant) from Lianerzhai said that Wu Xun was still his maternal great-uncle, but once Tang Qinxin's father asked Wu Xun to lend him ten strings of cash. Wu Xun didn't care about family relations and demanded collateral for the loan. He said to Tang Qinxin's father, "Okay, point out which piece of land you have!" Zhang Chunhua (82 years old, formerly a poor peasant, now a new middle peasant) from Lianerzhai also said: The 72 mu of land in Lianerzhai now was originally cultivated by people from Xierzhuang (belonging to Guantao). Because the poor peasants of Xierzhuang borrowed Wu Xun's high-interest loans and couldn't repay them, they pawned the land to him.
    2. Wu Xun rented out the land he had already occupied to peasants. When the peasants couldn't pay the rent, they sold their original small amount of land to him to offset the rent. This was Wu Xun's main method of expanding his land area in later years. Wang Maoli (deceased, from Xierzhuang, information provided by Li Wenlan from the same village) had 12 mu of his own land and rented about 20 mu from Wu Xun. The rent was 800 wen of cash per mu, equivalent to two dou of rice (50 jin). They could grow three crops a year, and in good years, they could harvest two dou of rice per crop. However, because the land was low-lying and often flooded, they often couldn't harvest two crops out of three. Because Wang Maoli couldn't pay the rent, he was forced to sell all his 12 mu of land to Wu Xun to offset the rent, and he had no choice but to take his family of five to beg for food.
    3. Peasants needed money urgently for weddings, funerals, or other celebrations and pawned their land to him, but when they couldn't redeem it on time, the pawn became a sale. In the table above, the contract for Wang Xuedu of Qiaozhuang selling Wu Xun 1.811 mu of land in the first month of Guangxu year 6 reads: "It is stated that the term is ten years, and redemption is allowed upon arrival, until it becomes righteous learning in the fourteenth year." It also says: "Dead land, living mouth, not allowed to be pawned or sold, only the person himself is allowed to redeem." It is clear that Wang Xuedu still couldn't come up with the money to redeem the 1.811 mu of land after ten years, but he couldn't pawn it to others for a higher price, so in the fourteenth year, he gave the land to Wu Xun. Also, as recorded in the same table, in March of Guangxu year 9, Chi Wancang from Furenzhai pawned 8 mu of land to Wu Xun. That contract notes: "Found 22,000 wen of cash on the seventh day of the third month of the tenth year, and found 58,000 wen of cash on the tenth day of the second month of the eleventh year." It is clear that after the land was pawned, Chi Wancang needed money twice, and finally, he sold the land to Wu Xun.
    4. Some peasants sold their land to Wu Xun, but for a certain period, the original household retained the right to use the land. The masses called this form "selling the horse but not leaving the trough." But if they couldn't pay the land rent on time, even the right to use the land would be canceled, and the land would be completely at Wu Xun's disposal. The table above records that on March 6th of Guangxu year 8, Chi Wand in Furenzhai sold 1.6853 mu of his homestead to Wu Xun. The contract reads: "The rent is 2,670 cash. The rent must be paid by the fifteenth day of the eighth month. If not paid, the homestead will be taken back." Also, on December 14th (New Year's Eve) of Guangxu year 8, Zhang Hengsong from Buzhai sold his 3.145 mu of land to Wu Xun. The contract reads: "Zhang Hengsong rented it back on the same day, stating that the total price was 4,730 cash. The deadline is the fifteenth day of the eighth month. If the money is not paid, a fine of 300 wen will be imposed, guaranteed by Zhang Yansong." This means that Zhang Hengsong handed over his land to Wu Xun for money use during the New Year, then became a tenant farmer, cultivating his original land, and made a contract: If he couldn't pay the rent after the autumn of the second year, not only would he lose his tenancy, but he would also be "fined 300 wen." This method of "fining 300 wen" is generally rare. It can be seen that this feudal landlord, dressed in beggar's clothes, was even more vicious than ordinary landlords.
    In the above examples, some are recorded in the "Land Accounts," and some are not recorded in the "Land Accounts," indicating that the "Land Accounts" do not contain all the land Wu Xun occupied in Tangyi and Guantao counties.
    The above is the main situation of Wu Xun seizing land from peasants at that time. After Wu Xun's death, the Liulin School Board, which had always been controlled by the landlord group, continued to plunder peasants by taking advantage of Wu Xun's original exploitation base. In 1943, under the brutal plunder of Japanese imperialism, puppet troops, and the people's corps, Tangyi suffered a great famine that killed more than 70,000 people (Tangyi originally had a population of 270,000, now only 200,000). The school board of Liulin Wu Xun School, led by the Yang family, formally decided: "After inspecting the school's old school land in Lianerzhai, totaling more than 71 mu, this year, because the land price there is higher (according to the lighter disaster situation—the author) and the land price in Wu Xun Town (ie, Liulin Town—the author) is lower (according to the serious disaster situation—the author), the school board decided: to sell all the school land near Lianerzhai at its price and use all the proceeds to purchase land near Wu Xun Town." At this time, the price of land in Lianerzhai, according to Liang Lianzhi in the village, was 80 yuan for superior land, 60 yuan for medium land, and 50 yuan for inferior land. But the school board of Wu Xun School bought the land near Liulin for a maximum of 25 yuan. Calculated on an average medium basis for the land in Lianerzhai, the land plundered by the Wu Xun school board in one year during the famine year was 100 mu! It is clear that the contempt and hatred of the local peasants for Wu Xun and the people in charge of his school today is not accidental. During the land reform, the peasants said, "Wu Qi is a landlord, and Yang Guanghan is a local tyrant." Du Ruzhen from Furenzhai was also forced to flee with his family and starved his wife and grandson to death because the school board seized his land tenancy. There was also Lin Yuqi from Dongwangxin Village, whose family of nineteen starved eight people to death because the Liulin School seized their land in the famine year! Even Wu Lulin, the grandson adopted by Wu Xun, was arrested and tortured to death in Tangyi County in the 16th year of the Republic of China for owing a year's school land rent. His son, Wu Jinlu, fled to the outside of the Guanzhong area and has only recently returned. His nephew, Wu Jinxing, works as an apprentice in a small oil mill, and his wife and sister-in-law both work as cooks in the landlord's house. Wu Jinxing shed tears when he told us this history. He said: "What did my old grandfather (Wu Xun) and my grandfather (Wu Kexin) kowtow everywhere for?!"
    The large landlord Wu Xun used "establishing schools" as a means to cruelly exploit the peasants. From the mouths of the peasants we interviewed, we know that Wu Xun, relying on his privileges, could stipulate that the tenant farmers who rented his land could not withdraw from the land, but Wu Xun could withdraw the land at any time and not allow a certain tenant to continue farming. Wu Xun, relying on his privileges, could also raise the rent at any time. In the event of a famine year or a poor harvest, no reduction or exemption was allowed, but rather a "fixed rent." The peasants said: "Wu Xun's rent cannot be owed, and it must be paid." In the land contracts we have seen, there is no place where the name "Wu Qi" is written directly, but it is always respectfully referred to as "righteous school." From this, we can also see the special status and considerable prestige of this landlord at that time.
    Therefore, we say that Wu Xun was a big rogue, big creditor, and big landlord who used "establishing righteous schools" as a means, was given privileges by the reactionary government at that time, and served the entire landlord class and the reactionary government. Isn't this accurate?
    Now is the era of the People's Republic of China. The farce of deceiving the Chinese people with Wu Xun's corpse should end, and the deceived people should awaken.

    Reduced version of three volumes of "Land Accounts"
    One of the contracts in the "Land Accounts"
    The contract states: "The seller, Chi Wand, because he has no money to use, now sells a section of homestead, totaling one mu, six fen, eight li, five hao, three si... sold to the righteous school under his name for permanent residence... Chi Wand rents the homestead of one mu, six fen, eight li, five hao, three si. The rent is two thousand six hundred and seventy cash. The rent must be paid by the fifteenth day of the eighth month. If not paid, the homestead will be taken back."
    Second of the contracts in the "Land Accounts"
    The contract states: "... Zhang Hengsong rented it back on the same day, stating that the total price was four thousand seven hundred and thirty cash. The deadline is the fifteenth day of the eighth month. If the money is not paid, a fine of three hundred cash will be imposed, guaranteed by Zhang Yansong."

　　武训历史调查记（五续）
  （五）武训的土地剥削
    武训历史调查团
    孙瑜说：武训是“封建主义统制阶级压迫下一个平凡的农民”（《武训画传》序）。李士钊说：武训是“被压迫农民阶级的先觉者”和“模范劳动者”（同上书正文）。的确，我们可以相信，孙瑜和李士钊二人的“立场观点是完全一致的”（同上书著者序）。可惜的是，武训本人却和他们作对，“先生一生的重要事迹”（同上书正文）和他们所宣传的，硬是不“一致”。武训既不是什么“平凡的农民”、“模范劳动者”，也不属于被压迫阶级。他是一个大债主，又是一个大地主，而且是一个凶恶的具有特权的大债主和大地主。武训的特权，特别表现在他的土地剥削方面。
    据我们所知，武训在堂邑有地，在馆陶有地，在临清有地。他在别县是否还有地，我们就来不及调查了。就是这三县的土地，仅据我们调查所得，已是三百多亩。其中以堂邑的地为最多，因为他在堂邑有特权，可以不缴粮赋。堂邑县官郭春煦曾将武训的田产“据禀申详，免捐银米，上宪明批，准银米悉由官捐，永以为例”（贾品重：武善士墓志铭）。因此，我们就将关于武训土地剥削情况的调查集中在堂邑，也有一部分是馆陶的。
    我们找到了武训买地文约的一部分，称为“地亩账”，共三册，都是武训逐年买地文约的抄本。这三册“地亩账”上所载文约有一部分是重复的，经剔除重复后，共得七十四笔，计土地二百八十五亩多。这三册“地亩账”分为两大册和一小册，前者是在堂邑武庄武训的曾侄孙武金兴手里找到的，后者是在堂邑赵郎砦曾替武训经管过财产的许谨传的后代手里找到的，都是很难得的历史材料，只可惜后者是被人剥落、剩下不多的残本。
    从这三本“地亩账”内所列年代看，武训早在三十岁时就开始当地，四十一岁时开始买地。最初不过一亩、半亩，为数甚少。到四十二岁的时候，便开始了大规模的掠夺，仅在这一年当中，即向二十一个农民夺取了土地六十三亩余，仅在三月一个月当中，即买地八次之多。次年，又向十四个农民夺取了土地一百零四亩余。到五十五岁的时候，他成为一个拥有近三顷土地的大地主。但这还是限于我们所找到的文字材料，看来还只是武训所占有的地产的一部，或大部，决不是全部。例如，据我们调查，武训在柳林镇还有土地二十二亩一分九厘二毫，连同三册地亩账上的数字，合起来就超过了三顷，共计三百零七亩三分二厘四毫六丝。
    现在根据这三本“地亩账”，将其置地时间、方法、地点、原主、亩数和地价等项，列表如下：
    这些土地，大都是被武训乘人之危从农民手里零星地夺取去的。每张文约上的地亩数，大都只有一、二亩，或二、三亩。我们见到的七十四张文约内，有三十八张，都是三亩以下的数字；十亩以上的，只有五张。武训每次置地的数目如此细小，足证大都是贫苦农民，遇了危急情况，不能生活下去，不得已才把土地卖给武训。武训之成为大地主，是在二十九年内（从他三十岁算起），用各种残酷的方法，逐步地积累起来的。
    表内所列地价参差不齐，原因之一是土地好坏不一。堂邑有一大部分是沙碱地，地价较贱。又表内光绪五年四月十三日买自娄士林的五分五厘零五丝地，买价达四十九千余文，那是因为连同房屋在内的缘故。光绪九年十二月初三日买自武克岐的一亩七分五厘，买价达五百五十千，其原因也是如此，也是宅基连同屋子。武训把这两所屋子拆了，搬到柳林去盖“义学”。
    表内所列地亩数，到光绪十一年三月初一日为止，共二二八·四八八五亩，这数字与郭春煦的初次请奖详文（《兴学始末记》）所列数字是极相近的。郭文称：“至光绪十二年冬，统计典买地二百三十亩有零，用去地价京钱四千二百六十三吊八百七十四文。”我们核计表内这二二八·四八八五亩的地价，其数字为四千一百六十九吊二百四十九文。为什么比郭的数字小一些呢？那主要是因为表内有二亩七分八厘五毫二丝的土地没有地价数字。如果以郭春煦所报地数、除所报地价总数、得出的每亩平均价格补入这笔地价，每亩以十八吊五百文计，二亩七分八厘五毫二丝的地价即为五十一吊五百二十六文，加上四千一百六十九吊二百四十九文，即为四千二百二十吊另七百七十五文，与郭春煦所报的数字只差四十三吊另九十九文钱。郭春煦所报是到光绪十二年冬季止，“地亩账”所载二百二十八亩多是到光绪十一年三月初一日止，这里有一年又九个多月时间武训置地数字无记载，可能即是这个四十三吊另九十九文差数的原因。因此我们可以判断我们所得到的地亩账到光绪十一年三月为止，是相当完整的真实历史材料。但是地亩账上也即是表上所有的自光绪十七年十二月到十九年十一月，武训续置的土地五六·六四四一亩，却始终未见诸满清官吏或地主们的呈报文字内。因此我们怀疑，武训除了所谓学田外另有地产，这种地产可能是他私人占有的。此外，地亩账内缺少从光绪十一年三月初二日起到光绪十七年二月十八日为止的六年又九个多月的记载。从光绪二十年起到武训死的那一年光绪二十二年为止，这两年多的置地记载，我们也未找到。武训越到后来积钱越多，所买的地也可能增加。所以我们说我们找到的三本地亩账仅是他的地产的一部或大部，决不是全部。
    武训的凶恶，除了表现在他放债的方法方面外，又表现在他向贫苦农民夺取土地的种种方法上。据我们此次调查所知，他所采用的方法有如下几种：
    一、农民借了武训的高利贷款，到期还不起，只得把土地当给他。这是武训开始占有土地的主要办法。中布砦的张玉池（二十九岁，中农）的曾祖父，便是因为使了武训的钱还不起，把两块土地（共六亩二分九厘二）当给了他。连二砦唐勤习（七十五岁，原是贫农，现在是新中农）说，武训还是他的舅爷爷，可是有一次唐勤习的父亲要求武训借给他十吊钱，武训不管亲戚不亲戚，借钱就得缴抵押品，他向唐勤习的父亲说：“行呀，你指给我哪一块地吧？”连二砦的张春华（八十二岁，前为贫农，现为新中农）也说：现在连二砦的七十二亩地，原来是西二庄（属馆陶）人种的，因为西二庄的贫农借了武训的高利贷还不起，把地当给了他。
    二、武训把已经占有的土地租给农民，农民交不上租，把自己原有的少量土地折卖给他。这是武训后期扩大土地面积的主要办法。西二庄王茂礼（已死，本材料由该村李文兰口述）自己有十二亩地，租了武训二十来亩地，每亩租价八百文制钱，合二斗米（五十斤），两年能种三季，丰年每季能收二斗米，可是因为地洼，常被水淹，经常是三季收不上两季。王茂礼因为交不上租，逼得把自己的十二亩地全折给武训顶了租子，自己只好带了全家五口人去要饭。
    三、农民因婚丧喜事急需用钱，把自己的土地当给他，可是到期无钱赎，便将当地变为卖地。在前面表中有光绪六年正月乔庄王学笃卖给武训一亩八分一厘地，文约上这样写着：“言明十年为满，期到许赎，以至十四年归于义学正。”又写：“死地活口，不许当卖，许本人赎。”可见王学笃是到十年还拿不出钱去赎回一亩八分一厘地，但是又不能用更高的价钱当给别人，所以到了十四年，便把土地给了武训。又同表所载光绪九年三月间，夫人砦的迟万仓把八亩地当给了武训，那张文约上便注明：“十年三月初七日找钱二十二千文，十一年二月初十日找钱五十八千文。”可见在当地之后，迟万仓两次需要钱用，最后终于把土地卖给了武训。
    四、有的农民虽把土地卖给武训，但在一定时间内，原地户还保持土地的使用权，群众把这种形式叫做“卖马不离槽”。但是如果到期交不起地租，便连土地使用权也取消，土地完全由武训支配。上表载光绪八年三月初六日夫人砦迟万德把一亩六分八厘五毫三丝宅基卖给了武训，文约上写道：“租价钱二千六百七十文，租价钱八月十五日交到，如若不到，将宅基收回。”又，光绪八年十二月十四日（年关），布砦的张珩松把自己的三亩一分四厘五毫土地卖给了武训，文约上写道：“当日张珩松租回，言明共价四千七百三十文，八月十五日为期，钱不到罚钱三百文，张岩松保。”这就是说：张珩松在年关因为要钱用便向武训交出了自己的土地，然后变为租佃关系，耕种自己原有的土地，并且立下文约：如果第二年秋后交不上租，不但要丧失佃权，而且还要被“罚钱三百文”。这种“罚钱三百文”的办法，一般是很少见的。可见这位穿着叫化子服装的封建大地主武训，比起一般地主来还要毒辣。
    在上述各项举例中，有些是在“地亩账”上载了的，有些是“地亩账”未载的，可见“地亩账”所载并非武训在堂邑馆陶二县所占土地的全部。
    以上是武训当时向农民夺取土地的主要情况。在武训死后，一直由地主集团把持的柳林学校校董会，利用了武训原有的剥削基础，向农民继续进行掠夺。一九四三年，在日本帝国主义、伪军、民团的残酷掳掠之下，在堂邑造成了死七万多人的大灾荒（堂邑原有二十七万人口，现在仅有二十万人口），柳林武训学校以杨家为首的校董们还正式作了决定：“查本校旧有学田在连二砦者七一余亩，本年因该处地价较高（按因灾情较轻——笔者）武训镇（即柳林镇——笔者）地价较低（按因灾情严重——笔者）经本校董会议决：将连二砦附近学田尽数价卖，即以所得地价，尽数购买武训镇附近地亩。”这时连二砦的土地价格，据该村梁连之讲，上等地值八十元，中等地值六十元，下等地值五十元，而武训学校的校董会在柳林附近买的土地，则最多出二十五元。连二砦的土地平均按中等计算，武训校董会在灾荒年一年所掠夺的土地即有一百亩！由此可见，今天当地农民对武训及其学校的管事人的鄙视与仇恨，实在不是偶然的。在土地改革的时候，农民说“武七是地主，杨光汉是恶霸地主”。夫人砦的杜汝真，也因为被校董会夺取了土地的租佃权，逼得全家流亡，饿死了他的老婆和孙子。还有个东王信村的林玉其，因为荒年被柳林学校夺去土地，全家十九口人饿死了八口！就是武训过继的孙子武鲁林，也因为欠了一年学田租子，于民国十六年被抓到堂邑县给活活的拷打死了。他的儿子武金禄流亡关外，最近才回来，他的侄儿武金兴到一个小油房做学徒，他的老婆和弟妇都到地主家当做饭女工。武金兴对我们讲这段历史的时候直掉眼泪，他说：“俺老爷爷（武训）和俺爷爷（武克信）到处磕头，图了个啥呀？！”
    大地主武训以“兴学”为手段，对农民进行了十分残酷的剥削，我们从被访问的农民口中，知道武训凭借特权，可以规定租种他土地的佃户不得退地不种，可是武训却可以随时抽地不给某一佃户续种。武训凭借特权，还可以随时涨租子。遇到荒年歉收，却又不准有任何减免，而是“死租子”。农民们说：“武训的租子不能欠，不缴不行。”在我们所见到的那些地亩文约上，没有一处是直书“武七”这个姓名的，而是一律尊称为“义学正”。从这里也看得出当时这个地主的地位的特殊和威风的不小了。
    因此我们说，武训是一个以“兴义学”为手段，被当时反动政府赋予特权而为整个地主阶级和反动政府服务的大流氓、大债主和大地主，这难道还不确切吗？
    现在是中华人民共和国的时代了，用武训这具僵尸欺骗中国人民的恶作剧应当结束了，被欺骗的人们也应当觉醒了。
