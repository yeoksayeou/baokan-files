Such a "Club"
　　Twenty-five thousand former German pilots, under the leadership of former Hitler general Hecht, have formed an air force club. Hecht said: He will strive to have the United States give the club a certain number of the latest jet aircraft.
　　Hecht's statement has a "basis," because the so-called "club" is just a guise; it is actually a tool for the United States to arm West Germany. Hecht is revealing the intention of his master.

Dollar Will Be Worth Less
　　Eric Johnston, director of the U.S. Economic Stabilization Agency, recently said: If no way can be found to deal with inflation, the dollar will be worth even less, and one dollar will only be equal to thirty or forty cents in 1939. Currently, one dollar is worth about 53 or 54 cents in 1939. He also predicted that the U.S. government will have a deficit of 5 billion to 7 billion dollars this year. He said: "This amount is not very large." Johnston's reason is probably: 5 billion dollars is only equivalent to more than 2 billion dollars in 1939!

French Court "Lost for Words"
　　On the morning of July 18, when the French court tried the patriotic fighter Henri Martin, it questioned the "witness" Libert, who reported Martin. Most of his testimony was used as the basis for false accusations. This "witness's" testimony was very confusing; he tried in vain to prove that Henri Martin had engaged in sabotage. But when answering questions from Henri Martin and his lawyer, Vinier, Libert had to admit that he had voluntarily joined the German fascist navy in 1943 and fought against the French navy. The military authorities actually used the testimony of a person who had participated in the war against the French people and cooperated with the Hitler gang to falsely accuse Henri Martin. The reactionary court that persecutes peace fighters is "lost for words" to such a shameless degree!

  如此“俱乐部”
    二万五千名德国以前的飞行员，在前希特勒的将领赫克特领导下成立了空军俱乐部。赫克特说：他将努力使美国给与俱乐部一定数目的最新喷气式飞机。
    赫克特的说法是有“根据”的，因为所谓“俱乐部”只是一个幌子，它实际上是美国武装西德的工具，赫克特正道出他的主子的意图。
  美元将更不值钱
    美国经济稳定署署长蒋士顿最近说：如果不能想办法对付通货膨胀的话，美元将更不值钱，一块钱将只等于一九三九年的三、四角钱。现在一块美元约值一九三九年的五角三分到五角四分。他又预言：美国政府今年将有五十亿元到七十亿元的赤字。他说：“这个数目不算很大。”蒋士顿的理由大概是：五十亿元只不过合一九三九年的二十多亿元罢了！
  法国法庭“词穷”了
    七月十八日上午，法国法庭审判爱国志士亨利·马丁时，曾讯问检举马丁的“证人”利伯特，他的证词大部分被用来作诬告的基础。这个“证人”的证词非常混乱，他徒然想证明亨利·马丁曾从事破坏。但在回答亨利·马丁及其律师文尼尔的问题时，利伯特不得不承认，他在一九四三年曾自动参加德国法西斯海军并对法国的海军作战。军法当局竟根据一个曾经参加对法国人民作战的、和希特勒匪帮合作的人的证词，来诬告亨利·马丁。迫害和平战士的反动法庭，竟“词穷”到这种无耻的地步！
