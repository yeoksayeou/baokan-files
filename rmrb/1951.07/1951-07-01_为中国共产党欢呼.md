　　Hurrah for the Chinese Communist Party
    Situ Meitang
    On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, I offer my sincere and warm congratulations:
    The Chinese Communist Party is a party that represents the interests of the Chinese people and wholeheartedly strives for the interests of the Chinese people. Its victory is the victory of the Chinese people. It inherited and developed the excellent traditions of our ancestors, and led the Chinese people in arduous struggle for thirty years. Although the road was tortuous and difficult, the two great mountains weighing on our heads—imperialism and feudal forces—were finally crushed by us. We established the People's Republic of China and formed the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, which implements the people's democratic dictatorship. In the past year or so, we have achieved great construction results, implemented the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. This victory is a great victory, a victory of world historical significance. On this day of the thirtieth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, which also coincides with the first anniversary of the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, the people of the whole country cheer for our beautiful and lovely motherland, cheer for the radiant Chinese Communist Party, and cheer for the wise and great Chairman Mao!
    As the Chinese people of today, we have infinite pride and glory, infinite bright prospects, and infinite guarantees of happiness. This is because China has the Communist Party, and China has Chairman Mao! Overseas Chinese who have suffered from imperialist humiliation feel this even more directly. A broad united front of patriotic overseas Chinese is gradually taking shape, impacting the decadent rule of imperialism in every corner of the world.
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the sun of the Chinese people, shining on our way forward, and guiding us to strive for the construction of a peaceful, happy, free, and strong New China.
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the banner of the Chinese people's struggle!

　　为中国共产党欢呼
    司徒美堂
    对于中国共产党的三十周年节日，我敬献虔诚热烈的祝颂：
    中国共产党是代表中国人民利益并全心全意为中国人民利益奋斗不懈的党，他的胜利，就是中国人民的胜利。他继承而且发挥我们祖先优秀传统，领导中国人民艰苦奋斗三十年，道路虽然曲折困难，但压在我们头上的两座大山——帝国主义、封建势力，终于被我们打垮了，建立了中华人民共和国，组成了以毛主席为首实行人民民主专政的中央人民政府，一年多来，建设成绩巨大，实行抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命，这个胜利是伟大的胜利，是有世界历史意义的胜利，当此中国共产党三十周年纪念的今天，又适逢抗美援朝一周年的今天，全国人民为我们美丽可爱的祖国而欢呼，为光芒万丈的中国共产党为英明伟大的毛主席而欢呼！
    作为今日的中国人民，有无限的骄傲和荣耀，有无限的美好前程，有无限的幸福保证，这就是因为中国有了共产党，中国有了毛主席！饱受帝国主义凌辱的海外华侨，对于这点感觉尤为直接，海外广泛的华侨爱国统一阵线正在日渐形成之中，在世界每一个角落冲击着帝国主义的腐朽统治。
    共产党和毛主席是中国人民的太阳，他照耀着我们前进，为建设一个和平康乐、自由强盛的新中国而斗争。
    中国人民斗争的旗帜中国共产党万岁！
