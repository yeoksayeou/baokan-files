The People of Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, Donate Twelve Airplanes
Educators from Various Regions Donate Eight Airplanes; Ordnance Workers Donate Six Airplanes

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The People's Representative Conference for Resistance Against America and Aid Korea in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, decided to donate twelve fighter planes and two artillery pieces within half a year. They also sent a telegram to the General Association for Resistance Against America and Aid Korea, expressing their determination to resolutely implement the notice to continue strengthening the movement to resist America and aid Korea.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 17th] The people of Tunxi City, southern Anhui Province, have successfully completed their plan to donate one fighter plane. After the news of the Korean armistice talks reached Tunxi, the people of all walks of life in the city became even more determined to strengthen the national defense capabilities and safeguard world peace, and their enthusiasm for donations surged even higher. The amount of donations pledged by people from all walks of life increased sharply from 400 million yuan to 1.2 billion yuan within five days. As of the 14th, incomplete statistics show that it has reached more than 1.45 billion yuan. In addition, the donated and pledged figures from various agencies, people's organizations, and some farmers in the suburbs, as well as the long-term donation amounts decided by some industries in the business community to donate one or several days' profits per month, should have exceeded the predetermined target of 1.5 billion yuan. At present, people from all walks of life in the city are enthusiastically paying their donations to the local People's Bank.

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Ordnance workers across the country are enthusiastically launching a production increase and donation campaign. According to preliminary statistics, ordnance workers in various regions have proposed donating six airplanes, including two "Southwest Ordnance" airplanes, one each of "Northeast Ordnance Workers," "North China Ordnance," and "East China Ordnance Workers" airplanes, and one donated separately by employees of a certain factory. During the donation campaign, all employees of a certain factory in Northeast China decided to dedicate one day of work per month in the third quarter; employees of a certain factory in Southwest China decided to dedicate two Sundays a month as "Resist America, Aid Korea Labor Days" within half a year, and donate all the wages earned.

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Educators from various regions have proposed donating eight airplanes. Including three airplanes initiated by educators in Northeast China; two airplanes donated by educators in Shanghai; and education union organizations in Hubei and Shanxi provinces decided to donate one airplane each. The representative conference of grassroots organizations of the Beijing Education Union resolved to jointly donate a "Beijing School" airplane with students in Beijing. Educators in Wuhan have donated more than 170 million yuan in June.

　　Educators in various regions are making full use of their expertise to engage in writing, translation, editing, drawing, design, and the production of models, specimens, and the repair of machinery and instruments, to increase production and donate the increased income.

　　While carrying out the campaign to increase production and donate, many educators have also carefully reviewed and revised their patriotic covenants, including donation and preferential treatment work in the patriotic covenants. For example, Shanghai Guangming, Aurora, and Qilu Middle Schools have all decided to set up places for the children of martyrs and military dependents to be admitted free of charge.

　　However, according to the inspection by the Beijing Education Union, a few units do not have a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the donation campaign, and have not combined it with improving work and increasing income, and even have not grasped the principle that donations must be voluntary; the production increase and donation plans of a few units are impractical or have excessive requirements, hindering the health and work of employees. These should be noted and corrected by various regions.

　　湖北孝感专区人民献机十二架
    各地教育工作者献机八架兵工职工献机六架
    【本报讯】湖北省孝感专区各界人民抗美援朝代表会决定半年内捐献战斗机十二架、大炮两门。并致电抗美援朝总会，表示坚决执行继续加强抗美援朝运动的通知。
    【新华社芜湖十七日电】皖南屯溪市各界人民胜利完成捐献战斗机一架的计划。朝鲜举行停战谈判的消息传到屯溪后，全市各界人民对于加强祖国国防威力，保卫世界和平的信心更加坚定，捐献热情更加高涨。各界人民认捐款额，五天之内由四亿元激增至十二亿元，截至十四日止的不完全统计，已达十四亿五千余万元，加上各机关、人民团体和郊区部分农民的已捐和认捐数字，以及工商界部分行业决定每月捐献一天或数天盈利的长期捐献款额，当已超过十五亿元的预定目标。现该市各界人民正纷纷向当地人民银行踊跃缴纳捐款中。
    【本报讯】全国兵工职工，正在热烈开展增产捐献运动。据初步统计，各地兵工职工已提出捐献飞机六架，计“西南兵工”号两架，“东北兵工工人号”、“华北兵工号”、“华东兵工号”飞机各一架，又某厂职工单独捐献一架。在捐献运动中，东北某厂全体职工，决定在第三季度中每月献工一日；西南某厂职工决定在半年内每月以两个星期日为“抗美援朝劳动日”，把所得工资全部献出。
          （刘谦、李晖）
    【本报讯】各地教育工作者已提出捐献飞机八架。计东北教育工作者发起献飞机三架；上海教育工作者献两架；湖北、山西两省教育工会组织决定各献飞机一架；北京教育工会各基层组织的代表会议决议，与北京市学生共同捐献“北京学校号”飞机一架。武汉教育工作者在六月份内已捐献一亿七千万元以上。
    各地教育工作者纷纷利用各人的特长，从事著作、翻译、编辑、绘图、设计，和制造模型、标本、修理机械、仪器等增产工作，以增加的收入来捐献。
    与开展增产捐献运动的同时，许多教育工作者并认真检查修订了爱国公约，把捐献和优抚工作列入爱国公约。如上海光明、震旦、齐鲁等中学，都决定设置优待烈属、军属子女免费入学的名额。
    但据北京市教育工会检查，有少数单位对捐献运动的意义认识不全面，没有将它与改进工作、增加收入结合起来，甚至于对捐献必须出乎自觉自愿的原则还掌握得不够好；少数单位的增产捐献计划不切实际，或者条件过高，妨碍职工的健康与工作。这些都值得各地加以注意纠正。
