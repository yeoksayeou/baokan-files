Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to a report from the Telegraph Agency in Paris: A French Foreign Ministry spokesman announced on the 19th that General de Lattre de Tassigny, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in the Far East, would be visiting Washington soon at the invitation of the US government. The official statement stated: Tassigny will discuss with the US government "new methods of combating communism in Asia after the Korean armistice negotiations conclude."

Prior to this, American newspapers reported that Chase, the head of the US military delegation stationed in Taiwan, would visit Saigon.

According to the French government, approximately 30,000 remnant troops of the Kuomintang were "detained" in Vietnam after fleeing China.

At the same time, New York Governor Dewey is "visiting" the Far East. Dewey has already been to Japan and Korea, met with Chase and the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan, and will arrive in Saigon on the 23rd. Paris sources believe that Dewey is acting on the orders of Dulles, the mastermind of US policy in Asia and Special Consultant to the State Department.

　　美法加紧侵略越南
　  杜威等战争贩子将赴越活动
    【新华社二十二日讯】据电通社巴黎讯：法国外交部发言人十九日公布：远东法军总司令塔西尼应美政府的邀请，不久将到华盛顿去。官方声明称：塔西尼将和美国政府讨论《朝鲜停战谈判结束后在亚洲对共产主义作战的新方法》。
    在这以前，美国报纸报道：美国派驻台湾的军事代表团团长蔡斯将要访问西贡。
    据法国政府透露：约有国民党残余军队三万人在逃出中国以后被“拘留”在越南。
    正在这个时候，美国纽约州州长杜威又在“访问”远东。杜威已经到过日本和朝鲜，在台湾和蔡斯与蒋匪帮会谈过，并将在二十三日抵西贡。巴黎人士认为：杜威是受美国对亚洲政策主谋人、国务院特别顾问杜勒斯之命出来活动的。
