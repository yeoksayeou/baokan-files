Why Was Hebei's June Cotton Purchase and Storage Task Not Completed?

Hebei Province did not complete its cotton purchase and storage task for June. According to a report from the Hebei Provincial People's Government Commercial Department on July 5th, as of June 30th, the Provincial Cotton and Yarn Cloth Company had only actually stored over 6.92 million jin of seed cotton, accounting for 42.7% of the total planned cotton purchase for June, less than half of the original plan.

Why was the task not completed?

Some Leading Organizations Did Not Pay Enough Attention

(1) Individual regions' Party and government leading organizations did not pay enough attention to this work. Coupled with the heavy tasks of summer grain requisition and donations, and the demonstration phase being prolonged, the province was a step behind in the comprehensive promotion of cotton purchase and storage. Shijiazhuang and Dingxian Special Districts grasped the work relatively tightly, deploying it to villages around June 10th. Xingtai Special District was the latest, not conveying it to villages until June 20th, which delayed the cotton purchase time. Furthermore, most cotton fields suffered from aphids, and cadres focused on treating aphids while relaxing cotton purchase. Also, because the masses were busy treating aphids, the amount of cotton on the market also decreased. For example, from June 21st to June 26th, the daily market volume in Jin County decreased from 3,228 jin to 2,688 jin, and in Shijiazhuang City from 3,125 jin to 1,583 jin. There were indeed many objective difficulties, but it cannot be denied that the leading cadres in some regions did not make the greatest subjective efforts for this extremely serious political task of cotton purchase and storage; they did not properly combine summer grain requisition, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, aphid control, and cotton purchase and storage.

There Were Several Deviations in Cadres' Thinking

(2) Some problems in cadres' thinking have not been thoroughly resolved due to insufficient education. Some people have a purely task-oriented view, do not understand the political significance of national cotton purchase and storage, and only hope that the state will purchase at high prices and give more interest, believing that the task can be quickly "completed" in this way. Others lack investigation and research, are blindly optimistic, and lose confidence when encountering obstacles. For example, some cadres in the second, fourth, and seventh districts of Gaocheng County were blindly optimistic when accepting the task; however, the numbers allocated by the county were based on subjective estimates, and they became discouraged as soon as they reached the villages. The original purchase task assigned to Qiutou, a key demonstration village in the fourth district, was 80,000 jin, but the cadres lost confidence after inquiring in the village and hearing that the farmers did not have much cotton in storage, so they relaxed their work. By June 20th, the cadres working in the demonstration village still could not figure out how much cotton the village actually had. A third type of person was eager to achieve quick results, neglecting or abandoning propaganda and mobilization, using overly simple methods, and making the mistake of coercion, which also hindered the cotton purchase and storage task. For example, the cadres of Dongliang Village in the third district of Gaoyi County said at a mass meeting for selling and storing cotton: "Those who have cotton and don't sell it are little Chiang Kai-sheks! Send them to court!" (This erroneous statement was immediately corrected). In Dongciyi Village in the sixth district of Gaocheng County, the village cadres did not carry out in-depth propaganda for cotton purchase and storage, and immediately asked the masses to report the amount of cotton they had at the meeting. The masses were dissatisfied and left the meeting one after another. Some people even said: "The cotton is mine, what if I don't sell it?!" Some cotton collection station cadres also waited passively for cotton to be collected, ignoring propaganda; in addition, their attitude was cold, and some cotton farmers took their cotton to the station, but took it back home after disagreeing. Fourth, a considerable number of cadres lacked the idea of accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, emphasizing cotton-producing areas and neglecting general areas; emphasizing large markets and neglecting small markets; emphasizing large transactions and neglecting small transactions; they were in high spirits when collecting a lot of cotton, and in low spirits when collecting little cotton. This is also one of the reasons why the task was not well completed.

Cotton Farmers' Concerns Have Not Been Eliminated

(3) Cotton farmers have great concerns. Such as fear of revealing wealth, fear of being borrowed from, the idea that "it's better to rely on yourself than on your parents," reluctance to sell and waiting for high prices, fear that the public sector will not be trustworthy after storing, etc. According to investigations in various places, those with more cotton in storage are old middle peasants, new middle peasants, cotton merchants, and ginning households. These people, especially the old middle peasants, are generally the most affluent and have the most concerns about selling cotton. For example, in Malan Village, Shulu County, 53 of the households selling cotton were old middle peasants, accounting for 32.2% of the total number of cotton-selling households in the village, with an average of 52.1 liang of cotton sold per household; 32 were new middle peasants, accounting for 13.2% of the total number of cotton-selling households in the village, with an average of 35.7 liang of cotton sold per household; cotton merchants and ginning households accounted for 35.1% of the total number of cotton-selling households in the village.

Market Management is Not Strict in Some Areas

(4) Since the cotton price was raised in early June and the management of cotton merchants was strengthened, the listed price and market price of cotton are generally close. However, some areas do not strictly manage cotton merchants, and the listed price and market price are out of sync. For example, the market price of seed cotton per jin in Xiajin and Wei Counties is 100 yuan higher than the listed price, 40 yuan higher in Xingtai, and 400 yuan higher in Longyao. This hinders the state's purchase. According to a report from Hengshui Special District, the proportion of stored cotton in the total amount of cotton purchased and stored is relatively small. In the 1.31 million jin of cotton collected by the entire special district in June, only 205 jin of lint cotton and 43,015 jin of seed cotton were stored. There are two reasons for the small amount of stored cotton: one is that the interest rate on private loans in rural areas is high, and it is better to lend to individuals than to store in the bank; the other is that cotton farmers find the procedures of the national bank troublesome, and it is better to sell it outright.

The Hebei Provincial Financial and Economic Committee has instructed various places to pay attention to resolving the above problems. (Special Correspondent Dong Dong)

### 河北六月购棉储棉任务为什么没有完成？

　　河北六月购棉储棉任务为什么没有完成？
    河北省六月份的购棉储棉任务没有完成。据河北省人民政府商业厅七月五日报告，截至六月三十日止，省花纱布公司实际入库的只有六百九十二万余斤皮棉，占六月份收购棉花计划总数的百分之四十二点七，尚不及原计划二分之一。
    为什么没有完成任务呢？
  有的领导机关不够重视
    （一）个别地区党政领导机关对这一工作重视不够。加之夏征、捐献等任务繁重，示范阶段又拖长了些时间；因之，全省在购储棉花的全面推动上也就晚了一步。各地以石家庄专区和定县专区抓得较紧，六月十日左右布置到村。邢台专区最晚，六月二十日尚未传达到村；这就推缓了收购棉花的时间。再加以大部地区棉田生了蚜虫，干部抓紧了治蚜、放松了购棉；也由于群众忙于治蚜，市场上棉量也随之减少。如自六月二十一日至二十六日，晋县每日上市量由三千二百二十八斤减为二千六百八十八斤，石家庄市由三千一百二十五斤减至一千五百八十三斤。客观条件是有不少困难的，但也不可否认，有些地区的领导干部对于购棉储棉这一极为严重的政治任务并未作最大的主观努力；没有把夏征、抗美援朝运动、治蚜和购棉储棉工作很好地结合起来进行。
  干部思想上有几种偏差
    （二）干部思想上有些问题，由于教育不够，还未能彻底解决。一种人有单纯任务观点，不了解国家购储棉花的政治意义，只希望国家高价收买，多给利息，认为这样任务就能很快“完成”了。又一种人是没有调查研究，盲目乐观；碰到钉子，又失去了信心。如藁城二、四、七等三个区有些干部，接受任务时盲目乐观；但县里分配的数字是凭主观估计的，一到村里就泄了气；四区邱头重点示范村原分配收购任务是八万斤，干部到村一打听，听说农民存棉并不怎么多，就失去信心，放松工作。到六月二十日，在示范村工作的干部还摸不清村里到底有多少棉花。第三种人是急欲求成，忽视或放弃宣传动员，方法过于简单，犯了强迫命令的错误，也使得购储棉花任务发生了障碍。如高邑县三区东良村干部，在售、储棉花的群众大会上说：“有棉花不卖的是小蒋介石！送法院！”（这错误的说法已当即纠正）藁城县六区东慈邑村，村干部对购棉储棉工作没作深入宣传，竟在大会上立即让群众自报。群众不满纷纷离会。有的群众还说：“有棉花是我的，不卖该怎么办？！”还有的收棉站干部，坐等收棉，不管宣传；加以态度冷淡，有的棉农拉了棉花到站后，由于话头不合，又把棉花拉回家去。第四种，占相当多数的干部，缺乏集少成多的思想，重视产棉区，轻视一般地区；重视大市场，轻视小市场；重视大宗，轻视小宗；收多情绪高，收少情绪低。这也是未能很好完成任务的原因之一。
  棉农思想顾虑还未解除
    （三）棉农的思想顾虑很大。如怕露富，怕人借，“爹有娘有，不如自己有”，惜售等待高价，怕储存了公家不讲信用等。据各地调查，存棉较多的为旧中农、新中农及棉贩和轧花户，这些人，尤其是旧中农，一般是生活富裕售棉顾虑最多的阶层。如束鹿县马兰村，售棉户中旧中农五十三户，占全村售棉户百分之三十二点二，平均每户售棉五十二斤一两；新中农三十二户，占全村售棉户百分之十三点二，平均每户售棉三十五斤七两；棉贩及轧花户占全村售棉户百分之三十五点一。
  有些地区市场管理不严
    （四）自六月初棉价上调，加强棉贩管理后，棉花的牌价市价一般接近吻合。但有些地区对棉贩管理不严，牌价市价发生脱节现象。如夏津、威县籽棉每斤市价高于牌价一百元，邢台高四十元，隆尧高四百元。这就障碍了国家的收购。又据衡水专区报告，在购棉储棉总额中，储棉比数较小。在六月份全专区收的一百三十一万余斤棉花中，仅储得皮棉二百零五斤、籽棉四万三千零十五斤。储棉数量不大的原因有二：一是农村私人借贷利息较高，储到银行不如借给私人；一是棉农嫌国家银行手续麻烦，不如卖了干脆。
    对于以上问题，河北省财政经济委员会已指示各地注意解决。（本报特约记者董东）
