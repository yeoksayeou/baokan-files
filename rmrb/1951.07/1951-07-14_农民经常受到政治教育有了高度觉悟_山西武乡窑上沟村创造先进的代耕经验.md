Farmers are Constantly Politically Educated and Highly Conscious
Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang, Shanxi Creates Advanced Experience in Substitute Farming

The substitute farming work in Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has achieved great success and created advanced experience in substitute farming.

The village is one of the eleven model production villages in Shanxi Province. Last year, the total output of the village exceeded the pre-war level by 59%. The output of land farmed on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and disabled soldiers has also increased year by year. In 1948, the average output per mu of substitute-farmed land was 9.83 dou, reaching 1.23 shi in 1949, and increasing to 1.38 shi in 1950. Last year, the land output per mu of one-third of the revolutionary martyrs' and military families in the village exceeded the village average by more than 3 dou, and one-third of the households had more than 10 shi of surplus grain. All the revolutionary martyrs' and military families in the village live a prosperous life. This year, under the ideological education of patriotism in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, each mutual aid team has formulated patriotic covenants, treating preferential treatment work as the most important task, and ensuring that it will be done better than in any previous year. Their substitute-farmed land has reached the level of advanced farming households, with 65 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. The quality of fertilizer is very high, and they universally achieve three ploughings and four harrowings, inside cutting and outside padding of the land, and seed dressing with pesticides. They also completed spring ploughing and sowing earlier than ordinary farmers.

The main reason why Yaoshanggou Village has done a good job in substitute farming is that the substitute farming households have a high degree of political consciousness. They say, "Without the People's Liberation Army, there would be no us." Especially after receiving education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the farmers understand the significance of substitute farming even more. Everyone knows: "The volunteers are protecting us so we can live a peaceful life, and we also guarantee to grow good crops for the families of the volunteers." Now, in the whole village of more than 200 households, there are 37 newspapers, 27 reading groups, 18 civilian schools, and 36 propagandists, so farmers can receive political education regularly.

Based on a high degree of political consciousness, the farmers have adopted the most advanced substitute farming system. The land to be substitute-farmed is assessed three times by the village's preferential treatment committee (assessing labor, output, and land), and then approved by the village's People's Representatives Conference. The substitute farming burden of the whole village is fair and reasonable, and both the substitute farming households and the families being substitute-farmed are willing. The village adopts a contract output substitute farming system for revolutionary martyrs' and military families with no labor force, and a contract labor substitute farming system for households with insufficient labor but farming experience, fixing the substitute farmers and the number of substitute labor. The contract output substitute farming system is to ensure that the production of revolutionary martyrs' and military families catches up with the production level of advanced households, and the revolutionary martyrs' and military families sign a contract with the substitute farming households. The contract is signed once every autumn harvest, so that both parties can arrange the year's agricultural affairs. The contract output substitute farming method is based on the expected output of each substitute-farmed land and the planned increased output of the general advanced production households in the current year to determine the contracted output and the degree of cultivation. After the autumn harvest, the substitute farming households deliver grain to the revolutionary martyrs' and military families according to the output stipulated in the contract.

Inspection and evaluation are the best ways to ensure the implementation of the contract. For example, when the pre-sowing inspection found that the fertilizer applied to the land of Li Jinyan and other four military families was insufficient, they tried to subsidize 150 pieces of soybean cake and six nights of sheep manure (a flock of sheep lying in the field for one night is equivalent to one application of manure), so that the amount of fertilizer applied reached the village average of 65 dan per mu. The village's preferential treatment committee holds a meeting of revolutionary martyrs' and military families once a month to solicit opinions, and then convenes substitute farming households to evaluate and arrange the work for the next month. At the same time, a mass substitute farming inspection and evaluation campaign is launched according to each agricultural season to conduct criticism and commendation. In addition, in order to solve the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' and military families in accumulating coal, accumulating fertilizer, and engaging in sideline occupations due to lack of labor, the preferential treatment committee is responsible for organizing neighbors, women, and semi-laborers in the same courtyard as revolutionary martyrs' and military families to help with odd jobs and issue work tickets for odd jobs. This ensures that revolutionary martyrs' and military families have no difficulties in life.

On June 15, the village formulated the main contents of the 1951 second half-year preferential treatment work plan as follows:

(1) Ensure that the output per mu of land of revolutionary martyrs' and military families reaches the level of general advanced households. Under the goal of increasing grain production by two dou per mu in the whole village, substitute-farmed land should be increased to two dou and five sheng. (2) Under the principle of both parties finding their own targets, try to have experienced people substitute farm the land for revolutionary martyrs' and military families. Various new agricultural implements, improved seeds, pesticides, etc. should be used by revolutionary martyrs' and military families first. (3) Special attention should be paid to processing and adding fertilizer to revolutionary martyrs' and military families with poor production conditions, and cooperatives should be organized to provide low-interest or interest-free loans according to specific circumstances to help them engage in sideline production, and should specifically help them formulate production plans. (4) Ensure that the children of revolutionary martyrs' and military families have universal access to schooling and higher education opportunities. For disabled soldiers and orphaned, elderly, and widowed revolutionary martyrs' and military families, designated personnel should be assigned to take care of them, provide timely medical treatment when they are sick, and solve their difficulties in paying for medicine. Revolutionary martyrs' and military families should be mobilized to go to civilian schools to study and participate in political activities, so that their political consciousness can be continuously improved. At the same time, the masses should be enlightened to deeply recognize the glory of revolutionary martyrs' and military families. (5) The preferential treatment and substitute farming work should be inspected every half month, and the substitute-farmed land should be checked at any time. According to the agricultural season, detailed inspection and summary should be carried out, and a system of criticism and commendation should be implemented. Each mutual aid team should carry out a competition for preferential treatment and substitute farming and strive to be a model for substitute farming.

### 农民经常受到政治教育有了高度觉悟  山西武乡窑上沟村创造先进的代耕经验

　　农民经常受到政治教育有了高度觉悟
    山西武乡窑上沟村创造先进的代耕经验
    山西省武乡县窑上沟村的代耕工作收到很大成绩，并创造了代耕的先进经验。
    该村是山西省十一个生产模范村之一，去年全村的总产量已超过战前水平百分之五十九，所代耕的烈属、军属、残废军人的土地产量亦逐年上升。一九四八年代耕土地每亩平均产量九点八三斗，一九四九年达到一点二三石，一九五○年增到一点三八石。去年全村有三分之一户烈属、军属的土地产量每亩超过全村平均产量三斗以上，三分之一户有余粮十石以上。全村的烈属、军属都过着富裕的生活。今年在抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育下，各互助组都订立了爱国公约，将优抚工作当作头等重要任务，保证比已往任何一年都做得好。他们代耕田地已达到先进户的耕作水平，每亩施肥六十五担，肥料质量很高，普遍做到耕三耙四，土地里切外垫，药剂拌种，并比一般农民提早完成了春耕下种工作。
    窑上沟村做好代耕工作的主要原因，是代耕户有高度的政治觉悟，他们说：“没有解放军就没有咱。”尤其受到抗美援朝教育后，农民更懂得代耕的意义了。人人都知道：“志愿军保卫咱们过太平日子，咱们也保证为志愿军家属种好庄稼。”现在全村二百多户，有三十七份报纸，二十七个读报组，十八处民校，三十六个宣传员，农民能经常受到政治教育。
    在高度的政治觉悟的基础上，农民们采用了最先进的代耕制度。被代耕的土地是经过村优军委员会三评（评工、评产、评地），又经过村人民代表会议通过的。全村的代耕负担作到公平合理，又作到代耕户和被代耕户两相情愿。该村对无劳动力的烈属、军属采用包产代耕制，对劳动力不足而有耕作经验的户，就采用包工代耕制，固定代耕人和代耕工数。包产代耕制是为了保证烈属、军属生产赶上先进户的生产水平，由烈属、军属与代耕户签订包产合同。合同在每年秋收后签订一次，以便于双方一年农事的安排。包产代耕合同办法是以各代耕土地应产量与本年一般生产先进户的计划增产量为标准，确定包产量与耕作程度，秋收后代耕户按合同规定的产量向烈属、军属交粮。
    检查、评比是保证实现合同的最好方法。如下种前检查时发现李金炎等四户军属的土地肥料上得不足，即设法补助豆饼一百五十块，卧羊粪六夜（一群羊在田里卧一夜，即等于上了一次粪），施肥量达到了全村每亩平均六十五担的水平。村优军委员会每月召开一次烈属、军属会议征求意见，然后召集代耕户评比并布置下月工作。同时按照每一个农事季节发动一次群众性的代耕检查、评比运动，进行批评和表扬。此外，为了解决烈属、军属在积煤、积肥、搞副业方面缺乏劳动力的困难，由优军委员会负责，组织烈属、军属同院邻居、妇女、半劳动力帮助杂工，并发给杂工工票。这样就保证烈属、军属生活无任何困难。
    该村于六月十五日订出了一九五一年下半年优抚工作计划主要内容如下：
    （一）保证烈属、军属土地每亩产量达到一般先进户的水平，在全村每亩增产二斗粮食的奋斗目标下，代耕土地要增加到二斗五升。（二）在双方自找对象的原则下尽量使有经验的人给烈属、军属代耕土地。各种新式农具、优良种籽、杀虫药剂等先给烈属、军属使用。（三）对生产条件较差的烈属、军属，要特别注意加工加肥，并组织合作社按照具体情况借给低息或无息贷款，帮助其进行副业生产，并应具体帮助其订生产计划。（四）保证烈属、军属子女普遍得到上学升学的机会。对残废较重的军人，及孤、老、寡烈属、军属，确定专人照料，生病时及时医治，并解决其药费困难。要动员烈属、军属到民校去学习和参加政治活动，使他们政治觉悟不断提高。同时启发群众深刻地认识到烈属、军属的光荣。（五）优抚代耕工作要每半月检查一次，随时抽查代耕土地，按农业季节，详细检查总结，执行批评、表扬制度。各互助组要开展优军代耕竞赛，争取做代耕模范。
