To the Editor:

　　In order to actively respond to the call of the Central People's Government's State Council to sell and store cotton, our China National Cotton Yarn and Piece Goods Corporation, along with the People's Bank and the Cotton Inspection Institute, each selected a group of cadres to form a cotton purchase and storage propaganda team. On June 23rd, we went to various villages in the Linhai District of Binhai County to publicize and mobilize the masses to sell and store cotton. However, according to our understanding, some district and township cadres in the area have not paid enough attention to this work and have not yet taken action. For example, the head of a certain town in the district told us: "The county government has not assigned us to do this work." The masses reported that the younger brother of District Chief Jiang of Linhai District has 700-800 jin of cotton stored at home, which has not been sold yet; Wang Zhaolian, who runs a small shop, has hoarded more than 1,000 jin, and there has been no mobilization for him to sell it; Wu Jinyu, the head of Weidang Township, has 200-300 jin of cotton stored and refuses to sell it. Linhai District is one of the cotton-producing areas. It is estimated that farmers still have a lot of cotton in storage. In order to successfully complete the national cotton purchase and storage task and enable the textile mills to resume work as soon as possible, I suggest that the Binhai County People's Government promptly check and correct the errors of certain cadres in the county who do not pay attention to cotton purchase and storage work.

　　苏北区滨海县应迅速纠正某些干部忽视购棉储棉的错误编辑同志：
    为积极响应中央人民政府政务院售棉储棉号召，我们花纱布公司和人民银行、棉花检验所，各抽出一部分干部，组成了购棉储棉宣传组，于六月二十三日前往滨海县临海区各乡村，宣传动员群众售棉储棉。但据我们了解，该区某些区乡干部对此工作仍未引起重视，迄今尚未行动起来。如该区某镇镇长对我们说：“县政府就未布置我们做这工作。”群众反映临海区姜区长弟弟家存有七、八百斤花。至今尚未出售；开小店的王兆连囤存了千余斤，至今也没有动员他出售；韦荡乡乡长吴金余存棉二、三百斤亦不肯出售。临海区是产棉区之一，据估计，农民尚有不少存棉。为顺利完成国家购棉储棉任务，使纱厂早日复工，我建议滨海县人民政府迅速检查和纠正该县某些干部不重视购棉储棉工作的错误。
