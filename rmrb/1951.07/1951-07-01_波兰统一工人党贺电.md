To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

　　On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we extend our warm greetings to you, dear comrades, and wish you new and outstanding achievements in the construction of a new democratic China.

　　The thirty years of your glorious Party, established under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution, have been thirty years of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism for national and social liberation, and thirty years of the continuous development and growth of your Party. Your Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, has correctly applied the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and has become the leading force of the Chinese people and the organizer of their historically significant victory.

　　The liberation of China from imperialist oppression and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are a victory for the advanced humanity of the whole world. It has further shaken the foundations of international imperialism and is an example and encouragement to the people of all colonial and dependent countries who are fighting for their freedom and independence.

　　The fraternal alliance of the great Chinese people with the invincible and powerful Soviet Union, and their friendship and cooperation with the people of all People's Democratic countries, are a great force for maintaining the cause of peace and an insurmountable obstacle to imperialist aggression.

　　On this 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, we hope that the entire Chinese people will achieve further successes in the cause of peaceful construction. We are deeply convinced that we, united in the common struggle for peace, will win victory over the forces of war and reaction under the leadership of the great Stalin.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party

　　波兰统一工人党贺电中国共产党中央委员会：
    兹值中国共产党建党三十周年之际，谨向您们，亲爱的同志们，致以热烈的敬礼，并祝您们在新民主主义中国的建设事业上获得新的卓越的成就。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命影响下建立起来的您们光荣的党的三十年，是中国人民反对帝国主义、封建主义，为民族解放和社会解放而斗争的三十年，是您们的党不断发展壮大的三十年。您们的党正确地运用了马克思列宁主义的不朽的学说，在中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志领导之下，已成为中国人民的领导力量，及其具有历史意义的胜利的组织者。
    中国之从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来，以及中华人民共和国的成立，是全世界先进人类的胜利，它更大地动摇了国际帝国主义的根基，对于正在为自己的自由和独立而斗争的各殖民地和附属国的人民，是一个榜样和鼓舞。
    伟大中国人民与不可战胜的强力苏联的兄弟般的联盟，及其与各人民民主国家人民的友好和合作，是维护和平事业的巨大力量，是帝国主义的侵略不可克服的障碍。
    在此建党三十周年的纪念日，热望全中国人民在和平建设事业上获得进一步的成就。我们深信，为共同的和平斗争而团结起来的我们，在伟大斯大林的领导下，将赢得对战争与反动力量的胜利。
                               波兰统一工人党中央委员会
