　　Hasten to Check Patriotic Pacts in July
    The fact that Shijiazhuang and other areas in Hebei Province are universally checking the implementation of patriotic pacts according to the notice of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is a necessary step to continue strengthening the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and to implement it in all kinds of work. Based on the recent situations in Hebei, northern Anhui, and other places, many areas have serious tendencies toward formalism in the movement to establish patriotic pacts; some areas even still have many blank spots to this day. The basic reason for this situation is that the leading organs in these areas lack the necessary inspection of the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. The notice issued by the northern Anhui branch of the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Association on July 14th pointed out that the branch originally planned to conduct a comprehensive inspection of patriotic pacts before the end of June, but by early July, only Chuxian and Bengbu had submitted inspection reports. This situation shows that there is a basic weakness in the work of leading the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in some areas, which is the lack of regular, effective, and in-depth organizational work. Most of the leading organs in the area are only satisfied with the mass upsurge that was initiated around May 1st, while neglecting to consolidate and develop the achievements of the mass movement in a timely manner. Some leading cadres in some areas are only satisfied with issuing calls, holding meetings, and generally arranging work, thinking that they have fulfilled their leadership responsibilities after doing these things, and they can ignore what happens afterward. Facts have proven that this is completely wrong. In addition to doing the above-mentioned work, the more important responsibility of the leading organs is to grasp the situation in a timely manner through various forms of inspection in the movement, understand the main problems existing in the movement, summarize and promote successful experiences, and criticize wrong tendencies, so as to maintain ideological guidance over the movement. This is the main method of the Party in politically leading the mass movement. Failure to do so means abandoning leadership responsibility, which inevitably turns many good resolutions into empty words, makes it impossible to consolidate the high political enthusiasm of the masses, and causes formalism to occur in patriotic pacts.
    Now, it is already the end of July. Many leading organs in various regions have already carried out spot checks and general checks of patriotic pacts in accordance with the instructions of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and have discovered many important problems; relying on the results of the inspection, the leading organs have more confidently grasped the laws of continuing to advance this movement. However, there are also many other areas that have not yet conducted inspections, and leading cadres lack the necessary attention to inspection work, which must be quickly corrected. The Party's leading organs should earnestly lead the spot checks of patriotic pacts, obtain typical experiences, and then conduct a general inspection of patriotic pacts in a guided manner. This is a decisive key to continuing to strengthen the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the future.

### 抓紧在七月份检查一次爱国公约

　　抓紧在七月份检查一次爱国公约
    河北省石家庄等地按照抗美援朝总会的通知，普遍检查爱国公约执行情形，这是继续加强抗美援朝运动并使之贯彻到各种工作中去的必不可少的步骤。根据最近河北、皖北等地的情况看，不少地区在订立爱国公约的运动中有严重的形式主义偏向；有些地区甚至至今仍有很多的空白点。造成这一情况的基本原因，是这些地区领导机关对抗美援朝运动缺乏必要的检查。皖北抗美援朝分会七月十四日发出的通知中指出：该分会原定六月底以前全面检查一次爱国公约，可是到了七月上旬却仅有滁县、蚌埠两地送了检查报告来。这个情况说明了某些地区在领导抗美援朝运动工作中，存在着一个基本弱点，这就是缺乏经常的有效的深入的组织工作。大部分地区领导机关只是满足于“五一”前后所掀起的群众热潮，而忽视了及时地巩固和发展群众运动的成果。有些地区的领导干部只满足于发出号召、召开会议和一般的布置工作，他们以为做完了这些工作便算尽了领导责任，以后的事便可以不闻不问了。事实证明，这是完全错误的。领导机关除了做上述的那些工作外，更重要的责任是在运动中通过各式各样的检查，及时掌握情况，了解运动中存在的主要问题，总结和推广成功的经验，批评错误的倾向，从思想上保持对运动的指导。这是党在政治上领导群众运动的主要方法。不这样作，就是放弃了领导责任，因而也就不可避免地使许多好的决议变成了具文，使群众高度的政治热情无法巩固，使爱国公约发生了形式主义的偏向。
    现在，已是七月下旬了。不少地区的领导机关已经依照抗美援朝总会关于检查爱国公约的指示，开展了抽查和普查的工作，发现了很多重要问题；领导机关依靠检查的结果，已经更有把握地掌握了继续推进这一运动的规律。但是，另外也还有很多地区至今尚未进行检查，领导干部对于检查工作缺乏应有的重视，这是必须迅速纠正的。党的领导机关应当认真领导爱国公约的抽查工作，取得典型经验，然后有领导地进行爱国公约的普遍检查。这是继续加强今后抗美援朝运动的决定性的一个关键。
