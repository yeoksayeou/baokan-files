High-Speed Cutting Method at Tianjin Machine Factory
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Meng Fan

Before May of this year, Li Wenqing, a boring machine worker at the Tianjin Machine Factory, was busy all day, not even daring to stop during mealtimes, and work was constantly piling up. The factory director said, "The boring machine is the weakest link in our factory's production." Li Wenqing felt very upset whenever he thought of this. How could he improve the efficiency of the boring machine? Li Wenqing had repeatedly discussed it with technicians and fellow workers, but they could never figure out a solution.

In May of this year, after listening to the report from workers who had visited the high-speed cutting demonstration in Beijing, Li Wenqing jumped for joy. He thought, "This time my problem can be solved!" But Ma Fucheng, who worked with him on the boring machine, didn't quite believe it. He said, "Soviet lathes are new, so of course they can increase the number of revolutions. Our 'old clunker' shakes if you take a deep cut, let alone high-speed cutting; even low-speed cutting is impossible." However, Li Wenqing still mustered his courage and found a cemented carbide cutting tool to experiment with that night. Unexpectedly, when he increased the spindle speed to ninety revolutions, it couldn't cut anymore, so he went to the workshop supervisor to discuss it. The supervisor said, "In the Soviet Union, the high-speed cutting method is used on lathes and honing machines. Our boring machine rods are soft, and the wear force is small. If you increase the number of revolutions, you will damage the machine."

Two days later, Liu Honglai, a labor model at the factory, successfully implemented the high-speed cutting method on an existing lathe. This greatly encouraged Li Wenqing. He absorbed Liu Honglai's experience and began to experiment again. He ground the cutting tool into a negative rake angle and increased the spindle speed to one hundred and twenty revolutions, but the quality of the work was still not good, and the electric rollers were also very hot.

Finally, he told Engineer Du Hongmo of the factory about the situation in detail and tested the effective horsepower of the machine tool and the machine tool parts with the engineer. After research, the engineer found that the horsepower was too small, the cutting tool angle was incorrect, and the top center was dead, so accelerated friction would risk "flying workpieces." In response to these shortcomings, the engineer helped Li Wenqing replace the boring machine's motor from 7.5 horsepower to 15 horsepower, replace the dead center with a live center, change the cutting tool's angle from a negative rake angle to a positive rake angle of two degrees, and increase the number of revolutions to 268. After this series of improvements, the cutting speed increased from 17 meters per minute to 152 meters per minute, and the efficiency of boring a cylinder bore increased tenfold. At the same time, the quality also improved significantly. The roundness error of the cylinder bore decreased from 0.03 mm to 0.01 mm, and the surface was also very smooth. Li Wenqing happily said, "In the past, everyone thought that the slower the boring machine ran, the more accurate the work would be; but now, the faster the machine runs, the more accurate the work is."

On June 10th, the factory held a high-speed cutting method performance conference, and Li Wenqing also participated in the performance. Ma Fucheng, a worker who previously thought that boring machines could not perform high-speed cutting at all, was also convinced. He said, "This method is good, I'll try it too." From that day on, the production of boring machines in the factory changed. In the past, a lot of work was backlogged and could not be completed, but now, they could bore everything that came in. Sometimes the supply of processed parts could not keep up, so they had to add some other work to do.

### 高速切削法在天津机器厂

　　高速切削法在天津机器厂
    新华社记者  孟帆
    今年五月以前，天津机器厂搪床工人李文清整天忙着，连吃饭的时候都不敢停车，活还老是压下来。厂长说：“搪床是咱厂生产上最弱的一环。”李文清一想起这句话，就非常难过。怎样提高搪床的效率呢？李文清曾再三和技术员、工友们研究过，但是总没有研究出一个道理来。
    今年五月，李文清听了去北京参观高速切削表演的工人的报告后，高兴得直跳起来。他想：“这回我的问题可以解决了！”但和他一起干搪床活的马富成却不大相信，他说：“苏联的车床是新式的，当然可以增加转数。我们那‘破锣’吃刀深一点就幌三幌，别说高速切削，低速切削也不行。”可是，李文清仍然鼓起勇气，当天晚上就找把硬质合金刀具作验。想不到当他把主轴转数增加到九十转时，就车不动了，于是他去找车间总管商量。总管说：“在苏联，高速切削法是用在车床和锐床上的，咱们的搪床杆子软，磨损力也小，你再增加转数，会把床子弄坏了。”
    过了两天，该厂劳动模范刘鸿来在原有的车床上试行高速切削法获得成功。这事使李文清得到很大鼓励。他吸收了刘鸿来的经验，又开始作试验。他把刀具磨成负前角，把主轴转数提高到一百二十转，但车出的活，质量还是不好，而且电滚子也很热。
    最后，他把经过情形详细告诉了该厂杜鸿模工程师，并和工程师一起测验了机床的有效马力和机床零件。经过研究，工程师发现马力太小，刀具角度不对，同时顶尖也是死的，如加速磨擦，有“飞活”的危险。针对这些缺点，工程师帮助李文清把搪床的马达由七匹半马力换成十五匹马力，把死顶尖换成活顶尖，把刀具的角度由负前角改为正前角二度，把转数增加到二百六十八转。经过这一系列的改进，切削速度就由过去每分钟十七公尺提高到一百五十二公尺，搪一个汽缸眼的效率提高了十倍。同时质量也有显著提高，汽缸眼的圆度误差由零点零三公厘减少到零点零一公厘，而且表面也很光滑。李文清高兴地说：“过去大家认为搪床开得越慢，车的活越规矩；可是现在呢，车开得越快活越规矩。”
    六月十日，全厂举行了高速切削法表演大会，李文清也参加了表演。过去认为搪床根本不能进行高速切削的工人马富成也服气了。他说：“这个法子好，我也试试。”从这一天起，厂内搪床的生产就变了样。过去活压下很多搪不出来，现在来一个搪一个，有时加工品供应不上，还得加点别的活干。
