Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

    The People's Daily "Reader's Letter Page" published opinions on strengthening security work at the Jinxi Chemical Factory on May 30th. We believe that most of these opinions are correct. In the future, we will definitely strengthen the education of our security personnel and strictly implement various systems to ensure production safety.

    Regarding the photography issue mentioned in the criticism, all photography was conducted with factory approval and proper documentation. When taking photos outdoors, our factory's security guard, Tong Yiquan, and others carefully inspected the photographers and did not discover any instances of unauthorized photography without proper credentials.

### 锦西化工厂对加强保卫工作的意见的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    锦西化工厂对加强保卫工作的意见的答复编辑同志：
    五月三十日人民日报《读者来信专页》刊出关于锦西化工厂应加强保卫工作的意见。我们认为，这些意见大部分是正确的。今后我们一定加强对警卫人员教育，严格执行各种制度，以确保生产安全。
    批评中所谈摄影一事，那都是经过厂部批准并持有证明进行的。在室外摄影时，我厂警卫队战士佟以全等，均曾认真检查，并未发现过没有证明私自照像的事。
