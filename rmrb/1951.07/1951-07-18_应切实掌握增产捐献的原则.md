　　The Principle of Increasing Production and Donation Should Be Effectively Grasped
    On June 22nd, I received a letter from my cousin (who works in a Western medicine shop in Guangzhou). The letter said: "On June 14th, our trade union held a donation challenge meeting. At the meeting, everyone displayed a high degree of patriotism... I originally donated 20,000 yuan, but later increased it to 100,000 yuan, challenging other comrades at the meeting. As a result of the challenge, some workers donated huge sums that I could not have imagined, demonstrating their enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea."
    I believe that it is inappropriate to use this challenging method to donate airplanes and cannons. Because during the challenge, everyone will be motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and will not consider their personal lives, donating too much money. This will cause difficulties in the donors' lives later on and lead to bad consequences. I think that the situation of using this challenging method to donate airplanes and cannons may also occur in other places. Therefore, I am reflecting this situation to you in order to attract everyone's attention. I hope that all regions will correctly grasp the principle of increasing production and donation in the donation campaign, implement the enthusiasm of the masses for donation into production, and donate the increased income to purchase airplanes and cannons, consolidate national defense, and support the Volunteer Army.

### 应切实掌握增产捐献的原则

　　应切实掌握增产捐献的原则
    六月二十二日我收到表哥（在广州一家西药行工作）来信。信中说：“六月十四日，我们工会召开了一个捐献挑战大会。会上大家发挥了高度爱国主义精神………。我原来捐献二万元，后来增到十万元，在会上向其他同志挑战。挑战结果，有几位工友捐献了我所不能想像到的巨额，表现了他们抗美援朝的热情。”
    我认为：用这种挑战的方式来捐献飞机大炮是不恰当的。因为在挑战的时候，大家会激于爱国热情，不考虑到个人的生活，而捐献过多的钱。这样，就会使捐献人以后生活发生困难，而引起不好的后果。我想，用这种挑战方式来捐献飞机大炮的情况，其他地方也可能发生。因此，我把这个情况反映给你们，以引起大家的注意。希望各地在捐献运动中正确掌握增产捐献的原则，把群众捐献的热情贯彻到生产中去，把增加的收入捐献出来，购买飞机大炮，巩固国防，支援志愿军。
