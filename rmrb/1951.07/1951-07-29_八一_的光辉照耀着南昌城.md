　　The Glory of "August 1st" Shines on Nanchang City

August 1st—the 24th anniversary of the birth of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army is approaching. The people of Nanchang, the heroic city where the Chinese People's Liberation Army was born, are welcoming this glorious and great festival with boundless joy. These days, production competitions are in full swing among the workers of Nanchang City as a gift to the "August 1st" Army Day. Many families are rushing to prepare various gifts to be presented to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army. The "August 1st" Auditorium, the largest building in Nanchang City, located in the southeastern part of the city and capable of accommodating 6,000 people, has been decorated beautifully inside and out. In the square in front of the auditorium, a giant tower soars into the sky, with huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the creators of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, hanging at the top of the tower. The "August 1st" Park, built in the central part of the city on the site where the "August 1st" Uprising troops fought against the Kuomintang bandit army 24 years ago, is now in full bloom. Adjacent to the east of the park, a new "August 1st" Stadium capable of accommodating 90,000 people has been built. The "August 1st" Bridge, spanning the Gan River for 1,000 meters in the northwestern part of the city, has been newly painted with green paint, and at night, the lights make the bridge look particularly magnificent and majestic.

Under the radiance of "August 1st," the people of Nanchang City are actively participating in and vigorously promoting national defense construction. More than 8,000 young students and young workers throughout the city are vying to enroll in military cadre schools. Pan Li, a patriotic female middle school student in the city, applied to join the military cadre school in January of this year, but was not admitted due to poor health. Since then, she has participated in morning exercises, joined the basketball team, and ran to the school every dawn to practice high jump and long jump alone. This summer, when the military cadre school was recruiting students, she was honorably admitted.

In order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, large quantities of consolation money and gifts have been sent to the Korean front. Tens of thousands of consolation letters are constantly being sent to the front. Medical workers and railway employees have successively organized eight volunteer medical teams and transportation teams to go to the Korean front. In order to allow the wounded and sick of the Volunteers to recover their health and return to the front as soon as possible, more than 17,000 young men and women have signed up to donate blood. At the Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which discussed the implementation of the call of the Chinese People's Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to increase production and donations, the representatives of Nanchang City first proposed that the people of the city guarantee to donate nine airplanes. Currently, this donation campaign is in full swing. In the upsurge of opposing American aggression and defending world peace, the number of people in Nanchang City who signed in support of the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact accounts for more than 70% of the city's population. As the birthplace of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Nanchang City are meticulous in their care and concern for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Every festival, the people of the city carry gifts to express their condolences. Public hospitals in the city provide free or reduced medical treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. Construction workers often provide free repairs to the homes of the families of martyrs and soldiers. More than 1,100 families of martyrs and soldiers with working ability have found jobs with the help of the Municipal People's Government. More than 100 children of the families of martyrs and soldiers have also been sent to schools by the Municipal People's Government to study.

The people of Nanchang City are determined to build this heroic city, the birthplace of the People's Liberation Army, into an even more beautiful and lovely place. The city's 27 originally uneven, dirty, narrow streets have now been repaired into smooth, wide, flat, and clean roads. Various trees have been planted on both sides of the roads. More than 400 brand-new houses have been built on vacant land in the city, and more than 480 dilapidated old houses have been rebuilt. The city-wide People's Representative Conference, which was held one week before the "August 1st" Festival this year, also discussed and approved the New Nanchang Construction Plan. The New Nanchang construction movement is about to be launched on a large scale.

The glory of "August 1st" shines on Nanchang City, inspiring the people of Nanchang City to forge ahead courageously.

　　“八一”的光辉照耀着南昌城
    新华社记者　张海涛、王介方
    八月一日——伟大的中国人民解放军诞生二十四周年纪念日来临了。南昌，这个诞生中国人民解放军的英雄城市的人民，正以无限欣喜的心情迎接着这个光荣伟大的节日。这些日子里，南昌市工人们作为“八一”建军节献礼的生产竞赛正在热火朝天地进行着。许多人家在赶制准备献给中国人民志愿军与人民解放军的各种礼物。矗立在南昌城东南部可容六千人的南昌市最大建筑物——“八一”礼堂，已被从里到外修饰得漂漂亮亮的。礼堂前面广场上，巨塔耸入天空，塔的顶端挂着中国人民解放军的创造者——毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像。建筑在城市中部二十四年前“八一”起义部队与国民党匪军作战地点的“八一”公园，现正百花齐放。紧靠公园东部，已新建筑起一个能容九万人的“八一”体育场。城西北部横跨赣江长达一千公尺的“八一”桥，已新漆上绿色油漆，入夜，灯光照耀，使桥显得格外壮丽雄伟。
    在“八一”的光辉照耀下的南昌市人民积极参加了并正大力参加着国防建设。全市八千多个青年学生、青年工人，争先恐后地报名参加军事干部学校。该市爱国女中学生潘丽，在今年一月报名参加军事干部学校时，因身体不好，未被录取。从此以后，她就参加早操，参加篮球队，每天黎明就跑到学校里，一个人练习跳高、跳远。今年暑假军事干部学校招生时，她光荣地被录取了。
    为了支援中国人民志愿军，大批慰问金、慰问品被送向朝鲜前线。数以万计的慰问信不断地寄往前方。医务工作者和铁路员工们先后组织了八个志愿赴朝医疗队、运输队，奔赴朝鲜前线。为了让志愿军伤病员早日恢复健康重返前线，报名输血的青年男女达一万七千多人。在讨论实现中国人民抗美援朝总会增产捐献号召的江西省各界人民抗美援朝代表会上，南昌市的代表首先提出该市人民保证捐献飞机九架。目前这个捐献运动正在如火如荼地展开。在反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平的热潮中，南昌市人民在拥护缔结五大国和平公约上签名的人数占全市人口百分之七十以上。作为人民解放军诞生地的南昌市人民，对革命烈士和革命军人的家属的体贴和关怀无微不至。每逢过节，该市人民就抬着礼品去慰问。市内公立医院都免费或减费给烈属、军属们诊病。建筑工人们经常给烈属、军属们义务修理房屋。全市一千一百多个有工作能力的烈属、军属，都在市人民政府帮助下，找到了职业。一百多个烈属、军属的子弟也由市人民政府送入学校学习。
    南昌市人民决心要把这个诞生了人民解放军的英雄城市建设得更加美丽可爱。市内的二十七条原来高低不平、污臭狭窄的街道，现在已修成为光滑、宽阔、平坦、整洁的马路。马路两旁都栽上了各种树木。市内空地上已建筑起四百余栋崭新的房屋，四百八十多栋破烂旧房已改建。今年“八一”节前一个星期召开的全市各界人民代表会议，又讨论和通过了新南昌建设计划方案。新南昌建设运动即将大规模展开。
    “八一”的光辉照耀着南昌城，它鼓舞着南昌市人民奋勇前进。
