　　Xinhua News Agency, July 28th:

    To avoid the possibility that a Korean armistice would hinder the advancement of aggressive war preparation plans, American monopoly capitalists have recently launched a massive propaganda campaign to justify the "necessity" of intensifying armament expansion through the fabricated "Soviet threat." The latest example of this campaign is the speech delivered by Acheson on the 24th in Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry.

    Clearly tasked with clamoring for war enterprises, the U.S. Secretary of State, at the Detroit celebration commemorating its 250th anniversary, addressed the ambassadors of England, France, and Canada to the United States, as well as representatives of major corporations, using his entire speech to advocate for war preparations.

    Acheson stated plainly: "Whether the talks in Korea result in an armistice or not, the fundamental task before us will not change." Acheson explained that this fundamental task is to establish an aggressive war bloc, which is to "intensify the tremendous effort to expand our (referring to the United States and its allies) armaments." Acheson admitted that the United States is not only advancing "the plan for the consolidation of military forces under the North Atlantic Treaty" in Europe, but also "currently seeking to create other powerful situations in Asia, the Middle East, and other parts of the world," including the aggressive so-called "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and the "U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Security Treaty" which are being rapidly finalized in the Pacific. Acheson also revealed that the United States is prepared to "fully maintain" its massive armament plan.

    Acheson's hypocritical rhetoric cannot conceal America's aggressive intentions. He explained that the true purpose of America's armament expansion lies in "addressing the 'problems' created by the Soviet Union" "under the protection of our military shield." Regarding this point, Acheson hinted that what the United States is "seeking" is "a change in the Soviet system." This fully exposes the ambitions of U.S. imperialism to deliberately invade the Soviet Union. According to Acheson, another part of the problem that the United States is prepared to "address" with force as a backing is "issues such as those arising from the awakening of the vast people of Asia and the Middle East, their desire for national self-determination, and their desire to improve their living conditions." Acheson thus indicated that another purpose of America's armament expansion is to interfere in the movements for national independence and democracy of the vast people in these regions.

    For such obvious imperialist purposes, Acheson demanded that the American people be prepared to "endure many more sacrifices, more shortages of goods, more taxes," and to "endure long-term tensions," while at the same time "desperately start working and producing goods."

    However, while Acheson was speaking glowingly, he inadvertently admitted an important fact, which is that even he himself feels that "the future may be very difficult and very distant."

　　为战争企业鸣锣喝道
    艾奇逊鼓吹扩军备战反苏反人民
    但又承认前途很困难而且很遥远
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国垄断资本家因为害怕可能的朝鲜停战会使侵略战争的准备计划难以推行，最近发动了巨大的宣传运动，以虚构的“苏联的威胁”辩解加紧扩军的“必要”。这个运动的最近的一个例子，是艾奇逊二十四日在美国汽车工业中心底特律市所发表的演说。
    负着明显的为战争企业鸣锣喝道的任务，这位美国国务卿在底特律纪念它建市第二百五十周年的庆祝会上，对着英、法、加驻美国的大使和大企业的代表们，用他的全部演说来鼓吹战争准备。
    艾奇逊明白地说：“无论朝鲜的会谈能否得到停战，我们面前的基本任务是不会改变的。”艾奇逊说明，这个基本任务就是建立侵略战争集团，就是“加紧进行巨大的努力，扩张我们（指美国及其同伙）的军备”。艾奇逊承认，美国不仅要在欧洲方面推进“北大西洋公约的汇合军事力量的计划”，而且，“目前也设法在亚洲、中东及世界其他地方造成另一些有实力的局面”，包括正在加紧完成中的太平洋方面的侵略性的所谓“美日安全条约”和“美澳新安全条约”在内。艾奇逊同时透露，美国准备把它的巨大军备计划“充分维持下去”。
    艾奇逊的虚伪辞藻掩盖不住美国的侵略意图。他说明，美国扩张军备的真正目的在于“在我们军事盾牌的保护下”来“处理”“苏联所造成的问题”。关于这一点，艾奇逊暗示，美国所“寻找”的是“苏维埃制度的改变”。这就充分暴露了美帝国主义蓄意侵略苏联的野心。按照艾奇逊的说法，美国准备以武力为后盾来“处理”的另一部分问题，是“诸如由于亚洲与中东的广大人民觉醒起来了、他们希望民族自决、希望改善他们的生活条件而引起的问题”。艾奇逊这样就表明了，美国扩张军备的另一目的，是为了干涉这些地区广大人民的民族独立和民主的运动。
    为了这种明显的帝国主义目的，艾奇逊要求美国人民准备“再受许多的牺牲，更多的物品荒，更多的捐税”，“忍受长期的紧张情况”，而同时却要“拼命开始工作，生产物品”。
    但是，艾奇逊在说得天花乱坠的时候，无意中却承认了一个重要事实，就是连他自己也觉得，“前途可能是很困难和很遥远的”。
