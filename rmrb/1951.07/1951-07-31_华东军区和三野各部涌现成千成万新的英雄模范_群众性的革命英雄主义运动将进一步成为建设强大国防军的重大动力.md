　　Thousands of New Heroes and Models Emerge from the East China Military Region and the Various Units of the Third Field Army
　  Mass Revolutionary Heroism Movement Will Further Become a Major Driving Force for Building a Strong National Defense Army
    The East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have continued to extensively and deeply carry out a mass revolutionary heroism movement over the past year, and thousands of new heroes, models, and people's meritorious servants have emerged.
    The revolutionary heroism movement originally had a solid foundation in the East China armed forces. After the National Conference of Combat Heroes last year, the heroic models who attended the conference returned to their units and widely conveyed the spirit of the conference, which further promoted the development of the movement. The East China Military Region and the Third Field Army also issued instructions to continue launching the merit-making movement, so that carrying out the revolutionary heroism movement became one of the regular tasks of the troops.
    Driven by the revolutionary heroism movement, a large number of new heroes, models, and meritorious servants have emerged in the East China troops in the past year while performing various tasks. For example, in performing tasks such as consolidating coastal defense and suppressing bandits, the troops of the Zhejiang Military Region have more than 18,000 commanders and fighters who have performed meritorious service. For example, Dai Zhengqian, the instructor of a certain unit who bravely defended the coast, once led thirteen soldiers to fight against seven hundred sea bandits with three gunboats, killing and wounding more than forty bandits. They persevered until reinforcements arrived and drove away the sea bandits together, while only one person in their own unit was slightly injured. Wu Yongbin, the deputy instructor of a certain unit, led a class deep into his hometown, which was severely afflicted by bandits, and killed and captured his grandfather and uncle who were bandits. He also launched military suppression and political offensives against the bandits, killing and wounding forty-seven bandits and persuading one hundred and eighty-six bandits to surrender in two and a half months. He Yonglin, the squad leader of a certain unit, disguised himself and went deep into the bandit dens many times to scout out the bandit situation, and finally wiped out the entire gang of bandits without any casualties. They and more than two hundred other heroic models participated in the representative meeting of heroic models of the Zhejiang Military Region.
    In the past year, many meritorious models have also emerged in the various troops in learning modern tactics and technology. For example, when Ma Chunsheng and other three soldiers of worker-peasant origin in a certain tank regiment were transferred from the infantry to learn to drive tanks, they had great difficulty in learning because they knew very few characters. They organized a learning mutual aid group of three people, formulated mutual aid covenants, and conducted regular inspections. Regardless of the cold wind and rain, greasy dirt, they climbed on the tanks all day long, memorized the complex machine parts, and studied driving techniques, and humbly asked the instructors and outstanding comrades for advice. Their mutual aid group was therefore awarded the title of model mutual aid group of the entire regiment. In the air force units, thousands of commanders and fighters have also performed meritorious service in the training movement. More than 4,000 people's meritorious servants have also emerged in the navy units in the past year.
    In the past year, more than 23,000 commanders and fighters of the East China Public Security Forces have performed meritorious service in performing tasks such as garrisoning cities, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and protecting the country's production and construction, and 983 people have been elected as models. For example, Wang Yuxiang, the deputy squad leader of a certain unit stationed in the urban area of Shanghai, closely contacted the residents in the defense area and gained an in-depth understanding of the situation, and thus successively solved three cases of privately hiding guns and arrested counter-revolutionaries. In the evaluation of merit, he was elected as a model of garrison work.
    The broad masses of militiamen in various military regions have also made great contributions in cooperating with the troops to defend the coast, suppress bandits, and maintain social order. Among the Fujian militiamen, 352 militiamen were commended by the military region, and 31 militiamen were rewarded. For example, the militia model Lin Wanggao used two rifles and a pile of bricks as weapons to lead the militiamen to defend the bunker. Although his wife was sacrificed and his property was destroyed, he remained bravely unyielding and crushed the bandits' attack. The merit-making movement has also been widely carried out in the leadership organs, logistics departments, schools, and factories of the East China troops at all levels. For example, among the twenty military region-level models selected by the Zhejiang Military Region, there are eleven model workers, including Zhou Yiqing, the acting medical room director who wholeheartedly loves the wounded and sick and studies modern medical technology diligently; Cui Kaigui, the deputy squad leader of the horse-drawn cart team who transports materials day and night regardless of wind and rain; Du Dezeng, the deputy platoon leader of the maintenance company who repairs the broken cars discarded by the enemy and saves the country a lot of money, and so on.
    Many cadres who have been immersed in office work for many years have made meritorious service and have been elected as meritorious servants and models. For example, more than 3,600 office cadres in the public security forces have made meritorious service. Hu Wenliang, deputy director of the Confidential Office of the Headquarters of the Zhejiang Military Region, has been engaged in confidential work for thirteen years, consistently maintaining a positive, responsible, diligent, and down-to-earth work style. This time, he was elected as the confidential work model of the military region.
    Recently, military regions and troops at all levels in East China have successively held representative meetings of heroic models, solemnly commended their merits, and elected heroic models at all levels. Under the leadership and promotion of the heroic models, the mass revolutionary heroism movement will further become a major driving force for building a strong national defense army and defending the motherland and world peace.

　　华东军区和三野各部涌现成千成万新的英雄模范
　  群众性的革命英雄主义运动将进一步成为建设强大国防军的重大动力
    人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军一年来继续广泛深入地开展了群众性的革命英雄主义运动，涌现了成千成万新的英雄模范和人民功臣。
    革命英雄主义运动在华东武装部队中原来就有坚实的基础。去年全国战斗英雄代表会议以后，参加会议的英雄模范们回到部队，对会议的精神作了广泛的传达，这就更加推动了运动的发展。华东军区和第三野战军也发布了继续展开立功运动的指示，各军区、部队都制订了立功条例，因而使开展革命英雄主义运动成为部队经常工作之一。
    在革命英雄主义运动的推动下，华东部队一年来在执行各种工作任务中，又涌现了大批新的英雄模范和功臣。如在执行巩固海防，清剿土匪等任务中，浙江军区部队有一万八千多个指挥员和战斗员立了功。如英勇保卫海防的某部指导员戴正乾，他曾率领十三个战士，与拥有三艘炮艇的七百余海匪作战，毙伤匪四十余名，坚持到援军赶来，一起驱逐海匪，而自己部队仅轻伤一人。某部副指导员吴永斌率领一个班深入匪患严重的家乡，打死与活捉了做土匪的祖父与舅父，并对土匪展开了军事清剿与政治攻势，二个半月中毙伤匪四十七名，争取了一百八十六名土匪投降。某部班长何永林多次化装深入匪窝，侦察匪情，最后全歼该股土匪而自己无一伤亡。他们和其他二百多个英雄模范都参加了浙江军区的英雄模范代表会议。
    各部队一年来在学习近代化的战术技术中也涌现了许多功臣模范。如装甲部队某团马春生等三个工农出身的战士，刚从步兵部队调去学习驾驶坦克时，因为识字很少，学习很困难。他们就三个人组织了学习互助组，订立互助公约，定期检查。他们不顾寒风冷雨，油腻污垢，整天爬在坦克上，熟记复杂的机器零件和研究驾驶技术，并虚心向教员与成绩优秀的战友请教。他们这个互助组因此获得了全团的模范互助组的称号。空军部队在练兵运动中，也有成千个指挥员和战斗员立了功。海军部队中一年来也涌现了四千多个人民功臣。
    一年来，华东公安部队在执行警备城市、镇压反革命分子、保卫祖国生产建设等任务中，有二万三千多个指挥员和战斗员立了功，并有九百八十三人当选为模范。如驻上海市区的某部副班长王玉祥，密切联系防区内的居民，深入了解情况，因而接连破获了三起私藏枪支的案件，逮捕了反革命分子。在评功中他被选为警备工作模范。
    各军区的广大民兵在配合部队保卫海防、清剿土匪、维持社会秩序中也有成千成万人立了功。福建民兵中有三百五十二个民兵受到军区表扬，三十一个民兵受到奖励。如民兵模范林旺高用两支步枪和一堆砖头为武器，率领民兵坚守碉堡，虽然妻子牺牲，财产被毁，仍然英勇不屈，粉碎了土匪的进攻。立功运动也已在华东部队的各级领导机关、后勤部门、学校、工厂中普遍开展。如浙江军区所选出的二十个军区一级模范中，有十一个模范工作者，其中有全心全意爱护伤病员，刻苦学习近代医疗技术的代理医疗室长周义清；不顾风雨日夜运输物资的马车队副班长崔开贵；修理敌人丢弃的破汽车，节省国家大量资财的保养连副排长杜德增等。
    许多多年埋头机关工作的干部立了功，被选为功臣和模范。如公安部队有三千六百多个机关干部立了功。浙江军区司令部机要处副处长胡文良十三年来埋头从事机要工作，一贯保持积极负责、刻苦踏实的优良作风，这次当选为该军区的机要工作模范。
    最近华东各级军区和部队都先后普遍召开了英雄模范代表会议，隆重庆功，并选出了各级的英雄模范。在英雄模范们的带头推动下，群众性的革命英雄主义运动，将进一步成为建设强大国防军、保卫祖国和世界和平的重大动力。
