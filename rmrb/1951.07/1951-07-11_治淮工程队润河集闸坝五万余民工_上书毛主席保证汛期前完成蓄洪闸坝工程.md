　　To Chairman Mao, our beloved leader, you called on us: "We must harness the Huai River well!" We also guarantee to you: "We must harness the Huai River well!"
               Respected Chairman Mao:
    The Huai River has been a scourge for hundreds of years. Last summer, floods swallowed our fields and homes again. When millions of people were besieged by floods, hunger, and death, it was you who sent lifeboats, distributed large quantities of relief grain, and transported relief winter clothing, repeatedly providing loans and seed to us, calling on us to organize and carry out production for self-salvation, enabling us to successfully survive the famine and obtain a bumper harvest this summer.
    Chairman Mao, for our long-term welfare, you have issued the great call to "fundamentally harness the Huai River." Dear Chairman Mao, when we heard this good news, we were indescribably happy and grateful, even shedding tears. Because we know that this wise decision to eradicate floods and benefit millions of people and their descendants can only be made under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party. In the old society ruled by the reactionary class, we wouldn't even dream of it!
    Last winter and this spring, we overcame countless difficulties such as ice and snow, severe cold, mud and silt, and gravel, and completed the tasks of dike restoration, breach closure, and dredging. In March this year, we began this crucial flood storage and diversion sluice dam – the Runheji diversion sluice project. This is a great and arduous project, the scale of which is not only unprecedented in Chinese history but also unique in Asia. Now, more than 50,000 of our civil workers are working day and night to speed up construction. Here, transportation of vehicles and horses is busy, equipment is piled up like mountains, and Runheji, which was still a barren grassland two months ago, has now become a new small city. This project is very arduous, and its arduousness lies not only in its huge scale, the imperialist blockade of materials, and the lack of construction experience. We have plenty of manpower, we will learn, and we can complete this huge modern project without a single nail from the imperialists; what surpasses these difficulties is the urgency of time. It is indeed something that the people of the whole country and you are constantly concerned about to complete such a huge project, unprecedented in history and unique in Asia, within seventy or eighty days.
    Our work is intense. Regardless of wind, rain, day, or night, we are working in battle. For three consecutive days on June 23, 24, and 25, there was heavy rain, and the ground was muddy and slippery. Tens of thousands of people were covered in mud and water, still working hard. After the heavy rain, the Huai River rose by three meters, and the rush to block the dam was carried out even faster. To welcome the water release on June 27, we worked continuously for twelve days and nights, and the cheers on the construction site never stopped day and night.
    Dear Chairman Mao, let us report to you that now, the fixed riverbed and dam have been completed and the water has been released. The construction of the lake inlet sluice has also begun. We will spare no effort to run ahead of the flood and complete the lake inlet sluice as scheduled.
    Dear Chairman Mao, you illuminate our glorious future like a torch. You issue a call to battle to us. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, we have defeated countless enemies. What difficulties can scare us?
    Dear Chairman Mao, you call on us: "We must harness the Huai River well!" We also guarantee to you: "We must harness the Huai River well!"

　　治淮工程队润河集闸坝五万余民工
    上书毛主席保证汛期前完成蓄洪闸坝工程
    亲爱的毛主席，您号召我们：“一定要把淮河修好!”我们也向您保证：“一定要把淮河修好！”
               敬爱的毛主席：
    淮河为患已经数百年了，去年夏天，洪水又吞没了我们的田园，房屋。千百万人民正在洪涛、饥饿与死亡围困中的时候，是您，派来了救生船，发下大批的救济粮，运来救济寒衣，多次地贷款和贷种籽给我们，号召我们组织起来，进行生产自救，使我们得以胜利地度过灾荒，并获得今年夏季的丰收。
    毛主席，为了我们长远的福利，您更发出“根治淮河”的伟大号召。亲爱的毛主席，当我们听到这个喜讯的时候真是说不出的欢喜、感激，甚至流下泪来。因为我们知道，这个根绝水患，为千百万人民及其子孙造福的英明决定，只有在您，在共产党的领导下才会做出，在反动阶级统治的旧社会里，做梦也别这样想的！
    去年冬天和今年春天，我们先后克服了冰雪严寒、泥水稀淤，砂礓等等指不胜数的困难，完成了复堤、堵口、疏浚的工程任务。今年三月，我们又开始了这个有重大作用的蓄洪与分水闸坝——润河集分水闸工程。这是一个伟大而艰巨的工程，它规模的巨大不仅在中国历史上是空前的，即在亚洲也还是唯一的。现在我们五万余民工正在日夜加紧赶修。这里车马运输繁忙，器材堆积如山，两月前还是荒凉草地的润河集，现在成了一个新兴的小城市。这一工程是十分艰巨的，其所以成为艰巨还不仅在于规模的巨大，器材方面帝国主义的封锁和修建经验的缺乏，我们有的是人手，我们会学习，我们能不要帝国主义的一根钉就把这巨大的近代工程完成起来；超越以上困难的是时间的紧迫。像这历史空前和亚洲仅有的巨大工程，必须在七八十天以内完工，确是全国人民和您所时刻关心的。
    我们的工作是紧张的，不管是刮风下雨，白天黑夜，我们都在战斗地工作着。六月二十三、四、五三天，连日大雨，地面泥滑不堪，数万人浑身泥水，依然奋力工作。大雨后淮水暴涨三公尺，拦河坝的抢堵工程反而进行的更快了。为迎接六月二十七日的放水，我们连续突击工作十二昼夜，工地上的欢呼声，日夜不停。
    亲爱的毛主席，让我们向您报告，现在，固定河槽和拦河闸已经落成放水了，进湖闸的工程亦已开始，我们要拚出全力，跑在洪水前面，将进湖闸如期完成。
    亲爱的毛主席，您像火炬一样的照耀着我们光辉的未来，您向我们发出战斗的号召，在共产党和您的领导下，我们战胜过无数的敌人，还有什么困难能吓倒我们呢？
    亲爱的毛主席，您号召我们：“一定要把淮河修好！”我们也向您保证：“一定要把淮河修好！”
