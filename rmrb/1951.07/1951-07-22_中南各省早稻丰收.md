Central and South China Provinces Report Bumper Early Rice Harvest

The provinces in the Central and Southern District generally report a bumper harvest of early rice. The early rice in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces has matured, and the grains are full. In some areas of Jiangxi Province, the highest estimated yield of early rice is 350 jin per mu, and the lowest is 200 jin. The early rice harvest in Liuyang, Liling and other counties in Hunan Province is generally expected to increase by 20% compared to last year. The above two provinces will begin full-scale harvesting of early rice in the second half of this month. Farmers in various places have universally organized harvest protection teams to defend the summer harvest.

Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have been successively harvesting early rice since late June. Binyang and other counties in Guangxi Province have harvested 30 to 50 jin more per mu than the normal yield. New rice from Guangdong Province has already entered the market, and the summer grain shortage that once occurred in the countryside has been safely overcome.

　　中南各省早稻丰收
    中南区各省早稻普告丰收。湖南、江西两省早稻已经成熟，谷粒饱满。江西省部分地区的早稻，每亩最高产量估计可收三百五十斤，最低也有二百斤。湖南省浏阳、醴陵等县早稻收成，一般可比去年增产百分之二十。本月下旬，上述两省早稻即可全面收割。各地农民已普遍组织了护收队，保卫夏收。
    广东、广西两省自六月下旬即陆续收割早稻。广西省宾阳等县每亩比常年产量多收三十斤至五十斤。广东省的新米已经上市，农村中曾一度发生的夏荒，已安然度过。
