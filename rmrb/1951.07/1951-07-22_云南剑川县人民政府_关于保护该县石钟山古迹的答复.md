    Yunnan Jianchuan County People's Government
    Reply Regarding the Protection of the Shizhongshan Historical Site in the County

    To the Editors:
    After reading the letter from Comrade Chen Daming in the February 14th "Readers' Letters" section of your newspaper regarding our county's lack of attention to protecting the Tang Dynasty historical site (stone carvings) on Shizhongshan, we feel that we should examine the fact that we have not paid enough attention to protecting local historical sites in the past. Although we issued a proclamation to our subordinates last May, after the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council promulgated the "Measures for the Protection of Historical Sites, Precious Cultural Relics, Books, and Rare Organisms," specifically calling for increased protection, we did not have a plan for how to specifically protect them. This is our major shortcoming. In addition to thanking Comrade Chen Daming for the reminder and guaranteeing that we will earnestly follow the instructions of our superiors in the future to protect local historical sites, we hope that the People's Governments in areas with historical sites, precious cultural relics, books, or rare organisms will vigorously mobilize the masses and cooperate with public security organs to do a good job in protecting the precious cultural heritage of the motherland.

    Regarding the protection of the Shizhongshan historical site in our county, we received special instructions from the Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Department of Culture and Education as early as last December and this March, and we also photographed the content of each grotto carving on the mountain and reported it to the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture. We are now looking for people to live on the mountain and guard it.

    Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to explain a few issues found in Comrade Chen Daming's letter to ensure accuracy.

    1. "Shijingshan" is a mistake for "Shizhongshan," because the "Shizhongshan" has Tang Dynasty stone carvings, and there is no Shijingshan in our county.

    2. The "sparrows" in "Brahman statues and many stone sparrows" are probably a mistake for the character "grotto", because all the statues of gods are carved in natural caves on the large cliffs, and there are no stone-carved "sparrows."

    3. The character "Ming" in "Tang Dynasty Nanming Kingdom" is probably a mistake for the character "Zhao," because Jianchuan in the Tang Dynasty was one of the "Six Zhao", the "Jianlang Zhao," which was later annexed by the "Mengshe Zhao."

    4. The stone carvings on Shizhongshan are not located within the Shizhong Temple. The "collapse of the temple" will absolutely not damage the stone carvings. However, the statue on the far left of the Brahman statues is being eroded by the mountain stream, but the water outlet was built with stones in the early years. Other damaged parts of the stone carvings, such as the fingers of individual statues, were damaged decades ago, not after liberation.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Wenbo of the Yunnan Jianchuan County People's Government accepted the criticism from our newspaper's readers, conducted a self-examination, and explained some of the inaccuracies. This responsible attitude is very good. The errors pointed out by Comrade Zhang Wenbo, except for the error of "Zhao" being written as "Ming," which was caused by our editing department's negligence, were all errors in Comrade Chen Daming's original manuscript. Of course, we are also responsible for failing to correct the errors in the original manuscript, and we hereby explain.

### 云南剑川县人民政府  关于保护该县石钟山古迹的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    云南剑川县人民政府
    关于保护该县石钟山古迹的答复编辑同志：
    读贵报二月十四日《读者来信专页》载陈大鸣同志关于我县不重视保护石钟山唐代古迹（石刻）的投书后，我们感到以前没有好好注意保护地方古迹这一点，是应该检讨的。虽然，去年五月奉中央人民政府政务院所颁布的关于古迹、珍贵文物图书及稀有生物保护办法后，我们就曾布告所属，特加保护。但是，对于如何具体地加以保护，根本就没有计划。这是我们的大缺点。我们除感谢陈大鸣同志的提醒，并保证今后切实遵照上级的指示，把地方的古迹保护好以外，并希望有古迹或珍贵文物图书或稀有生物的地区的人民政府，大力发动群众，配合公安机关，做好保护祖国宝贵的文化遗产的工作。
    关于保护我县石钟山古迹一事，早在去年十二月和今年三月我们就曾奉到省人民政府及省文教厅的专令指示，并将该山各石窟雕刻内容，摄影报转中央文化部文物局了。现在我们正物色人员，专门住山看守。
    最后，我们愿就陈大鸣同志的投书中发现的几个问题，附带在此加以解释，以符事实。
    一、“石镜山”，系“石钟山”之误，因为剑川有唐代石刻的是“石钟山”，而我县境内也没有这石镜山。
    二、“婆罗门神像及很多石雀”的“雀”，恐怕是“窟”字之误，因所有石刻的神像，是就天生的大崖石一窟一窟雕成的，并无石头雕成的“雀子”。
    三、“唐代南铭国”的“铭”字，恐怕是“诏”字之误，因剑川在唐代为“六诏”之一的“剑浪诏”，后被“蒙舍诏”所吞并。
    四、石钟山上的石刻，并不在石钟寺内，“寺庙倒塌”，也绝对不会损及石刻的，倒是婆罗门神像的最左侧的一个像，后因山上的溪水冲下，冲着神像，但这也在早年用石头将水口砌好了，其它石刻损坏的部分，如个别石像之手指，是数十年前就毁坏的了，不是解放后的事。

    编者附记：云南剑川县人民政府张文渤同志，接受本报读者批评意见并进行了检讨，对某些与事实不符部分加以说明，这种认真负责的精神是很好的。张文渤同志所指出的错误，除“诏”字误为“铭”字系由我们编校时的疏忽造成外，其余均为陈大鸣同志所写原稿错误。当然，我们对原稿的错误未能改正，也是应负责任的，特在此说明。
