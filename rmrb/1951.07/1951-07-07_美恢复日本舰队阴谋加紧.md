　　Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, June 6th: The "Delhi Times Weekly" published an article pointing out that the United States is stepping up its conspiracy to revive the Japanese fleet.
    The article said: According to people closely related to the US Navy Department, Takeo Okubo, Director-General of the Japan Maritime Safety Agency, has resigned under the insistence of the US Command in Tokyo because the latter is dissatisfied with the "slow" revival of the Japanese fleet. The US Navy Department insists on including the Japanese fleet in the US Far East Fleet before the end of 1951. The Japanese government was ordered to reorganize the Maritime Safety Agency according to the former Japanese Navy Ministry and formulate plans to restore and build large-tonnage Japanese warships.
    According to the US plan, the number of Japanese warships should reach 750 by the end of 1951, including three cruisers, four mine-laying boats, and seven destroyers. The new ships should be mainly built in the shipyards of the following concerns: "Mitsubishi" and "Kawanami" companies in Nagasaki, "Hitachi" company in Osaka, "Kawasaki" company in Kobe, and "Ishikawajima" company in Tokyo.
    The three joint companies promised by the United States to manufacture seaplanes and torpedo planes are the foundation for building Japanese naval aircraft.
    The article also said: The Japanese government is preparing to recruit another 25,000 non-commissioned officers and sailors who previously served in the Japanese fleet for the Maritime Safety Agency. The retraining of more than 3,000 former officers at the Kobe Maritime Safety School is about to end. Two hundred and fifty officers from the former Army and Navy Headquarters were selected to participate in studies at the Maritime Safety University recently established in Tokyo. The officers and former officers of the Japanese fleet are being retrained under the direct leadership of the US Far East Naval Command.

　　美恢复日本舰队阴谋加紧
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社德里讯：《德里时代周刊》刊载一篇文章，指出美国正在加紧恢复日本舰队。
    该文说：据和美国海军部有密切联系的人士说，日本海上保安厅长官大久保武雄，已在美国驻东京司令部的坚持下辞职，因为后者对日本舰队恢复的“缓慢”，感到不满。美国海军部坚持在一九五一年年底以前把日本舰队包括在美国远东舰队里的计划。日本政府奉命按照前日本海军省的样子改组海上保安厅，并制定恢复与建造吨位巨大的日本军舰的计划。
    根据美国的计划，日本军舰的数目到一九五一年年底应达到七百五十艘，其中包括三艘巡洋舰、四艘水雷艇、七艘驱逐舰。新的舰只主要地应该在下列各康采恩的造船厂建造：长崎的“三菱”与“川南”公司、大阪的“日立”公司、神户的“川崎”公司、东京的“石川岛”公司。
    美国所答应的三个制造水上飞机与鱼雷飞机的联合公司，是建设日本海军飞机的基础。
    该文又说：日本政府准备再为海上保安厅招募二万五千名以前曾在日本舰队服务过的士官与海员。三千多名旧军官在神户海上保安学校所受的再训练即将结束。二百五十名前陆军大本营与海军大本营的军官，被选派参加最近在东京建立的海上保安大学学习。日本舰队的士官与旧军官在美国远东海军司令部的直接领导下进行再训练。
