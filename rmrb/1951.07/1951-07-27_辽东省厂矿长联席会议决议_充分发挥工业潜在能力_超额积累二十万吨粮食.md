　　Liaodong Province Factory Director Joint Conference Resolution
　　Fully Exploit Industrial Potential
　　Exceed Accumulation of 200,000 Tons of Grain
　　The Industry Department of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government convened a joint conference of factory directors from July 11th to 16th. The conference discussed Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang's call to increase production and practice economy to accumulate wealth worth five million tons of grain for the nation. Based on the specific circumstances of provincial enterprises, the conference unanimously passed a resolution to increase production and practice economy to accumulate wealth worth 200,000 tons of grain this year. The specific measures are as follows: First, accelerate the turnover of working capital, shortening the cycle by 125 days, saving investment worth 83,000 tons of grain. Second, reduce the cost of various products of provincial enterprises by 6% to 7%, striving to accumulate an excess of 22,000 tons of grain. Third, increase equipment utilization rate, improve operating methods, reduce waste products, and improve quality, striving to increase the total value of products by 15% compared to the original plan, estimated to increase by 95,000 tons of grain.
    The conference believes that the Liaodong provincial enterprises are fully equipped to complete this task. Thanks to the efforts of all workers, Liaodong provincial enterprises have achieved rapid recovery and development in production in recent years. The total value of production of provincial enterprises in 1950 increased by 184.82% compared to 1949, and the plan for 1951 is to increase by 10% compared to the actual figure of 1950. From January to May of this year, the total value of production of enterprises directly under the Industry Department has completed 104.65% of the plan, which is 110.23% of the same period last year. In the first half of the year, 23 of the 28 products exceeded the plan. Among the 54 technical and economic norms for products of enterprises directly under the Industry Department, 45 exceeded the plan. In terms of capital turnover, the average turnover of working capital for provincial enterprises in 1950 was once a year, with a turnover period of 360 days. Based on the actual calculation in the first quarter of 1951, the average was 1.3 times, with a turnover period of 283 days. Although 1951 accelerated by 30.3% compared to 1950, shortening the turnover period by 77 days, there is still great potential. After discussion, the conference concluded that by actively disposing of stagnant materials in various factories and mines, accelerating product sales, reducing reserves, and shortening the production cycle, the capital turnover period of provincial enterprises could be accelerated to 235 days, with an average turnover of 1.53 times. Regarding the issue of reducing costs, the conference believes that it is necessary to start with saving raw materials, economizing on indirect personnel and factory and mine management expenses, reducing waste products, and increasing output. According to statistics from eleven units, by fully exploiting equipment capacity, increasing equipment utilization rate, and reducing workshop expenses and factory and mine management fees, costs can be reduced by approximately 4 billion.
    The important gain of the conference was unifying thoughts and unifying understanding. The vast majority of comrades ideologically corrected the erroneous perceptions that production was abnormal, objective conditions were not good, consumption quotas could not be completed according to plan, capital turnover could not be accelerated, costs could not be reduced, and efficiency could not be improved, and established correct economic accounting thinking.

### 辽东省厂矿长联席会议决议  充分发挥工业潜在能力  超额积累二十万吨粮食

　　辽东省厂矿长联席会议决议
　  充分发挥工业潜在能力
　  超额积累二十万吨粮食
    辽东省人民政府工业厅，于七月十一日至十六日，召开厂矿长联席会议。会议讨论了东北人民政府高岗主席为国家增产节约超额积累价值五百万吨粮食的财富的号召，并就省营企业具体情况，一致通过了今年增产节约价值二十万吨粮食的财富的决议。具体办法为：一、加速流动资金的周转，缩短周期一百二十五天，节约八万三千吨粮食的投资。二、将省营企业各种产品成本降低百分之六到百分之七，争取超额积累二万二千吨粮食。三、提高设备运用率，改善操作方法，减少废品，提高质量，争取产品总值较原计划增加百分之十五，约计增加九万五千吨粮食。
    会议认为目前辽东省营企业充分具备着完成这一任务的条件。辽东省营企业几年来由于全体工人的努力，在生产上获得了迅速的恢复和发展。省营企业一九五○年的生产总值，比一九四九年增加百分之一百八十四点八二，一九五一年计划比一九五○年实际增加百分之十。今年工业厅直属企业一至五月份生产总值已完成了计划百分之一百零四点六五，为去年同期的百分之一百一十点二三。上半年二十八种产品有二十三种均超过了计划，工业厅直属企业产品技术经济定额五十四项中，有四十五项超过了计划。在资金周转方面，省营企业一九五○年流动资金平均一年周转一次，周转期为三百六十天。以一九五一年第一季实际推算，平均为一点三次，周转期二百八十三天。虽然一九五一年比一九五○年加速了三十点三次，缩短了周转日期七十七天，但仍存在着很大的潜在力。会议讨论结果，在各厂矿积极处理呆滞物资，加速产品推销，减少储备量，缩短生产周期等措施下，可以使省营企业资金周转期加快为二百三十五天，平均周转为一点五三次。关于降低成本问题，会议认为必须从节省原材料、节约间接人员及厂矿管理开支费用、减少废品、提高产量做起。据十一个单位统计，由于充分发挥设备能力，提高设备运用率，减少车间经费及厂矿管理费，共可降低成本费约四十亿。
    会议的重要收获是统一了思想，统一了认识。绝大多数同志从思想上纠正了认为生产不正常，客观条件不太好，消耗定额完不成计划，不能加速资金周转，降低成本，提高效率的错误认识，树立了正确的经济核算思想。
