The native products of East China (including local products, specialties, and urban and rural handicrafts) account for a large proportion of the people's economic life. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of native products in 1950 was approximately 20 trillion yuan, equivalent to more than 27 billion catties of grain, accounting for 45 percent of the total grain output. Among them, excluding urban handicrafts, the total value was 15 trillion yuan, equivalent to 20 billion catties of grain, accounting for 34 percent of the total grain output. Averaging across the region's 120 million farmers and handicraft workers, each person produces 130,000 to 160,000 yuan, enough to exchange for three or four months of food rations or make three or four new outfits; enough to buy all the cotton cloth produced by the country's textile factories last year. However, this purchasing power has not been fully realized, because the native products have not all been sold in a timely manner. According to estimates made in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily's editorial on June 10, under the circumstances of the preliminary improvement of the financial and economic situation in the second half of last year, about six or seven tenths of the native products were sold, and three or four tenths were still unsold. This is still a number that should not be ignored, with an average loss of 40,000 to 60,000 yuan for each farmer and handicraft worker, and a total reduction of 5 trillion to 8 trillion yuan in market purchasing power and productivity.

  Native Products Conferences Promote Native Product Transactions
    Since February this year, governments at all levels in East China have regarded holding good native products conferences as the primary key to completing the task of selling native products. Throughout the first half of the year, this has been the central task of financial and economic work. More than 60 percent of the counties and prefectural districts, as well as the provinces, districts, and cities, have held native products conferences, and eight large-scale native product exhibitions have been held (including the East China regional Shanghai Native Products Exhibition currently being held in Shanghai). The East China Regional Native Products Conference held in Shanghai in June was a summary of a series of conferences over the past four months and the beginning of a more systematic and large-scale organization of native product sales work during the upcoming autumn exchange season.

    The achievements of this series of conferences are significant. Not only did the people's government's policy of promoting the sale of native products directly meet with the vast number of native product operators and private industrialists and merchants (more than 12,000 representatives participated in these conferences, more than 70 percent of whom were private representatives), unifying and improving understanding, but also, due to the adoption of the method of "holding meetings and conducting transactions at the same time," it directly promoted native product exchanges. The value of goods traded at several provincial, district, and municipal-level native product conferences was more than 870 billion yuan, of which native products accounted for more than 580 billion yuan. At this East China regional conference (June 10 to 29), the value of native products traded was more than 400 billion yuan, plus the 330 billion yuan of native product exchange agreements signed by the East China Cooperative Headquarters at its business meeting in early June, totaling more than 1.31 trillion yuan. These transactions should not be taken lightly. In addition to some native products from outside the region, they have already sold an average of about 10,000 yuan more native products for each farmer and handicraft worker in the region. If we estimate that three or four tenths of last year's output has not yet been sold, then it has solved one-sixth to one-quarter of the problem. It should be said that these transactions are only part of the actual exchanges in the region during this period; because, under the influence of this series of conferences, the enthusiasm of private merchants has increased, and in Shanghai alone, the funds used by 47 native product industries to purchase native products in rural areas from February to mid-May reached more than 300 billion yuan, thanks to the promotion of the municipal native product conference.

  Current Production and Sales Situation of Native Products in East China
    After the subjective efforts in the first half of the year, the current production and sales situation of native products in East China is as follows: Except for a few raw materials and native products whose markets rely entirely on exports, such as golden thread grass hats and most of the lace and carpets that rely on exports, which must be considered for suspension or reduction of production, the vast majority of native products can be sold domestically. Many native products that were originally for export have turned to domestic sales; some native products, because their original output was not large, immediately became in short supply as soon as they were promoted and demand increased; some native products are already selling well and can and should be produced and sold more; some are currently in the off-season, and if planned investment and production are not carried out, there will be a feeling of being in short supply when the peak season comes. In addition, there are still a considerable number of native products that can be sold but are currently unsold. Generally speaking, it is in the process of developing from unsold to selling well, and from selling well to selling briskly. However, the overall production level has not yet recovered to the proper level; the sales channels for native products need to be further expanded.

    Before February, the basic problem of native product trade in East China was the long-term historical factors that caused the production and sales areas to be out of touch with each other, and the lack of commercial links in the middle; now, the problem is how to propose clear production and sales guidelines according to the different situations of various native products, and how to find the central link to further expand the sales channels for native products. The conference spent the largest part of its time selecting more than 70 major products that are currently unsold and a few that are already in short supply, dividing them into professional groups, and conducting in-depth research using the method of detailed accounting comparison based on their past and present production, transportation, and sales processes. In this way, the problems were found, and clear guidelines and methods for solving them were proposed.

  Pricing Guidelines Determined
    The primary issue is the price issue.

    Should the sales area obey the production area? Or should the production area obey the sales area? How should the prices of native products that sell well be determined? At the conference, there were not many opinions that unilaterally favored the interests of one party in production, transportation, and sales. The guiding principle unanimously determined by the conference was: the policy of benefiting all three parties should be implemented according to the different production and sales situations of various native products: (1) For general best-selling native products that are in short supply, the main issue is to increase production, and the sales prices must be adjusted with reference to the production area prices under the premise of reducing transportation profits, in order to accelerate the development of production; (2) For native products that sell well and can be produced and sold more, both the production and sales parties should adopt the principle of small profits and quick turnover in order to seek better development of production and sales; (3) For relatively unsold native products that need to open up sales channels or need to open up broader markets, the principle of production area prices obeying the sales area should generally be adopted temporarily, and the first priority should be to open up and expand sales channels.

    To implement such a policy, the problem arises: how to achieve "reducing transportation profits," "small profits and quick turnover," and how to take care of the producers' costs and interests as much as possible when implementing production area prices obeying the sales area?

  Obstacles in Transportation and Sales Must Be Overcome
    After studying the production, transportation, and sales processes of many commodities, the key issues were clearly exposed, that is: there are still many obstacles in the transportation and sales process of native products, which seriously affect exchanges. The main reason for the unsold nature of many native products lies here.

    It is often the case that producers do not sell at a good price, but consumers cannot afford it because the price of goods is expensive. A coir rain hat costing 700 yuan in Taizhou, Zhejiang, sells for 2,000 yuan in nearby Shaoxing; dried longan costing 5,000 to 7,000 yuan per catty in Fujian production areas sells for 20,000 yuan in Shanghai, so that they have become unsold goods. Why is the price difference so large? The main reasons are many illegal levies, feudal monopolies in the transportation and sales process, too many intermediate transfers, unreasonable commissions, and excessive handling labor costs. In the past, there were 14 kinds of illegal levies in the grain and miscellaneous grain industry in Nanjing, and northern goods firms charged commissions of 30 to 50 percent for introducing a business deal. Handling fee rates, the handling and loading fees at Shanghai docks, are generally 60 to 90 percent higher than before the war, and the illegal levies and obstruction during handling often exceed the entire railway and ship freight. These are very serious obstacles. They are also the main links in further expanding the sales channels for native products. At this conference, many private merchant representatives spoke out with gnashing teeth to expose them. Some representatives also expressed their determination to reform their own business operations first in the spirit of self-criticism. The people's government and relevant departments should attach importance to this reform and provide leadership. In terms of handling labor costs, the main problems are that feudal remnants have not been completely eliminated, and there is currently an oversupply of handling labor. In addition to leading workers to eliminate the feudal headman system, relevant departments in various regions should quickly formulate reasonable labor costs, unify fee rates, and classify materials, gradually abolish various unreasonable surcharges, and find ways to transfer surplus labor or provide appropriate relief.

  Product Quality and Specifications Should Be Improved
    In the accounting comparison of unsold commodities, the representatives also reflected on the issue of product quality and specifications, believing that this is also an important link in opening up the sales of unsold native products. The reasons for poor quality and specifications are nothing more than: (1) Operators or producers, due to the unsold nature of their products, mistakenly attempt to reduce prices to compete for sales by lowering quality and specifications, resulting in a decline in credit and even more difficult sales. A type of handmade socks in Nanjing that had been reduced in quality was once called "crossing the street" and was even more difficult to sell. (2) After the products sell well, operators cut corners and seek exorbitant profits. (3) Merchants cut prices for purchases, forcing producers to lower quality to maintain costs. On the other hand, the main problem is that production does not meet sales. One is that the technology is backward and conservative, and the products are not as good as others. The second is that there is no communication with each other, and there is no understanding of consumer habits. The third is that social consumption patterns have changed. For example, most of the native paper in Zhejiang used to be used for superstitious purposes. If production continues as before after liberation, it will of course be unsold; but among them, those that have been changed to produce paper for cultural use are already in short supply and have great prospects for development.

    Overcoming various obstacles in the transportation and sales process and improving the quality and specifications of native products are the central links in how to turn many unsold goods into selling well, selling goods into being able to sell and produce more, and accelerate the production of best-selling goods.

  A Difficult Struggle Lies Ahead
    The production and sales guidelines and pricing guidelines proposed at this conference are clear, and the conference has also grasped the central links in further expanding sales. Breaking through this link is still a difficult and complex struggle, which should be carried out gradually, distinguishing between priorities and urgency. The more than 700 representatives who attended the conference signed ten "Native Products Conference Conventions" at the closing ceremony, which they must set an example of, earnestly abide by, and conscientiously convey and universally implement. This is the ideological and organizational preparation made for this combat mission, and the beginning of practical action.

　　华东土产产销情况和进一步打开销路的环节
    ——记华东区土产会议
    丰人
    华东地区土产（包括土产、特产和城乡手工业品），在人民经济生活上占很大比重。根据不完全的统计，一九五○年土产总值约为二十万亿元，折原粮二百七十多亿斤，占粮食总产量百分之四十五。其中除去城市手工业品，总值为十五万亿元，折原粮二百亿斤，占粮食总产量百分之三十四。以全区一亿二千万农民和手工业者平均计算，每人生产十三万到十六万元，能够换取三、四个月口粮，或是添制三、四套新衣；足够把去年全国纺织厂生产的棉布全部买下来。但这笔购买力并未全部成为现实，因为土产还未全部及时地推销出去。根据上海解放日报六月十日社论中所作的估计，在去年下半年财经情况初步好转的情况下，推销出的土产约有六、七成，还有三、四成是滞销的。这仍是一笔不应忽视的数目，平均每个农民和手工业者损失四万到六万元，总计市场购买力和生产力要减少五万亿到八万亿元。
  土产会议推动了土产交易
    今年二月以来，华东各级人民政府把开好土产会议作为完成土产推销任务的首要关键。在整个上半年，是作为财经工作的中心任务来进行的。百分之六十以上的县和专署区以及各省、区、市都开过了土产会议，并举办了八个规模巨大的土产展览会（包括正在上海展出的华东全区性的上海市土产展览会）。六月份在上海举行的华东区土产会议，就是对这四个月来一系列会议的总结，也是即将到来的秋后交流旺季中更系统、大规模地组织土产推销工作的开始。
    这一系列会议的成绩是很大的。不仅使人民政府推销土产的政策与广大土产经营者、私营工商业者直接见了面（参加这些会议的代表在一万二千人以上，百分之七十以上是私营代表），统一并提高了认识，而且由于采取了“边开会、边交易”的办法，直接推动了土产交流。几次省、区、市一级的土产会议成交的货值有八千七百多亿元，其中土产为五千八百多亿元，这次华东区的会议上（六月十日到二十九日）成交的土产为四千多亿元，加上华东合作总社在六月初业务会议上所签订的土产交流协议三千三百多亿元，共达一万三千一百多亿元。这几笔交易是不应轻视的，除去一部分外区的土产外，也已经平均为全区每个农民和手工业者多推销一万元左右的土产。如果以去年产量的三、四成还未推销出作估算，则是解决了六分之一到四分之一的问题。应该说，这几笔交易仅是全区在这一时期实际交流的一部分；因为，在这一系列会议的影响下，私商经营的积极性已见提高，仅上海四十七个土产行业，今年二月到五月中，由于市土产会议的推动，下乡收购土产的资金达三千多亿元。
  目前华东土产的产销情况
    经过上半年度的主观努力，目前华东土产的产销情况是这样：除了个别原料和市场全部依靠外销的土产，如金丝草帽及大部依靠外销的花边、地毯等必须考虑停产或减产外，绝大部分的土产是完全可以在国内打开销路的。不少原为外销货的土产，已转向内销；若干土产由于原来产量不大，一经推销，需求增大，立即供不应求；有些土产已经行销，可以并应当更加多产多销；有一部分目前看来是淡季，如果不作有计划的投资和生产，旺季来时就会感到供不应求。此外，可以打开销路，但目前还滞销的土产，为数还不少。一般地说，是在从滞销到行销、行销到畅销的发展过程中。但总的生产水平，还未恢复到应有的程度；土产的销路还需要进一步打开。
    二月以前华东土产贸易的基本问题是长期历史因素造成的产地销地互不通气，中间缺少商业纽带；现在，问题是如何根据各种不同情况的土产提出明确的产销方针，如何找出进一步打开土产销路的中心环节。会议以最大部分时间，选择了七十多种目前尚属滞销的以及个别已感供不应求的主要产品，按专业分组，按其过去与现在的产、运、销整个过程，用细算账相比较的方法，作了深入的研究。这样，把问题找出来了，而且很明确地提出了解决的方针与办法。
  确定了价格指导原则
    首要的问题，是价格问题。
    究竟销地服从产地呢？还是产地服从销地？行销的土产在价格上又应该如何呢？对于这些问题，会议中片面照顾产、运、销中一方利益的意见还不多。会议一致确定的指导原则是：应当根据各种土产产销不同情况，实现三方有利的政策：（一）一般供不应求的畅销土产，主要是增产问题，就须在降低贩运利润的前提下，参照产地价格来调整销地价格，以加速生产的发展；（二）行销和能多产多销的土产，产销双方都应采取薄利多销的方针，以求产销的更好发展；（三）比较滞销的土产需要打开销路或需要开辟更广阔的市场，一般应暂采取产地价格服从销地的方针，先求打开和扩大销路。
    实现这样的方针，问题就来了：怎样做到“降低贩运利润”，“薄利多销”以及在实行产地价格服从销地时，尽可能照顾生产者的成本和利益呢？
  还须克服运销中的重重障碍
    经过对许多商品的产运销过程的算账研究后，其中的关键性的问题是明显地暴露出来了，就是：土产的运销过程中还有重重的障碍，严重地影响交流。许多土产的滞销的主要原因就在这里。
    常常是这样：生产者并没有卖到好价，消费者却因为货价贵而吃不消。浙江台州七百元一顶箬帽，到不远的绍兴卖二千元；福建产地每斤五千元到七千元的桂圆，到上海要卖二万元，以致都成了滞销货。为什么差价如此之大呢？主要是陋规多、运销途中还有封建把持、中间转手层次太多、不合理的佣费，以及搬运力资过重等等。南京杂粮业过去陋规达十四种，北货行栈介绍一笔生意要坐取佣金三成到五成。搬运费率，上海码头上的搬运和装起仓费，一般比战前提高了百分之六十到九十，搬运中的陋规拦索，有时往往超过铁路和轮船的全程运费。这些是很严重的障碍。也就是当前进一步打开土产销路中的主要的环节。这次会议，不少私商代表曾切齿痛恨地发言揭露。也有代表以自我批评的精神，表示了首先在本业经营上加以改革的决心。人民政府和有关部门应重视这一改革，并加以领导。在搬运力资方面，主要是封建残余还未肃清，和目前搬力过剩的问题。各地有关部门，除应领导工人铲除封建把头制外，应迅速订定合理力资、统一费率和物资分等，逐步取消各种不合理的附加，并设法使过剩人力转业或加以适当的救济。
        应提高土产的品质规格
    在对滞销商品的算账比较中，代表们也同时反映了产品的品质规格问题，认为这也是打开滞销土产的重要环节。品质规格低劣的原因不外是：（一）经营者或生产者因产品滞销，错误地以降低品质规格的办法企图贬价竞销，结果信用低落，越发难销。南京一种降低了品质的手工织袜，就曾被人称做“过街通”而更难销售。（二）产品行销后，经营者偷工减料图谋暴利。（三）商人杀价收购，使生产者被迫降低品质以维成本。另一方面主要是产不合销。一是技术落后，保守，产品比不上人家。二是相互不通气，对消费者习惯不了解。三是社会消费情况变化了。如浙江土纸，过去绝大部分是迷信用纸，解放后再照旧生产，当然滞销；但其中已经改向生产文化用纸的，则已供不应求，有了大量发展的前途。
    克服运销过程中的各种障碍，提高土产品质规格，就是如何使许多滞销货转为行销、行销货更能多销多产、畅销货的生产加速发展的中心环节。
  摆在面前的是一场艰巨的斗争
    这次会议所提出的产销指导方针和价格指导原则是明确的，会议更抓住了进一步打开销路的中心环节。要突破这个环节，还是一场艰巨复杂的斗争，应该分别轻重缓急，逐步地进行。出席这次会议的七百多位代表，在闭幕时签订了十条必须以身作则、切实遵行并且认真传达、普遍贯彻下去的“土产会议公约”。这就是为这一战斗任务所作的思想上组织上的准备，和实际行动的开始。
