　　The Party Gave Me Strength
    I Reported My Reactionary Husband
     ——A Letter to Chairman Mao from Elementary School Teacher Wang Jinghua

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　On the occasion of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the great Communist Party, I, like the people who have stood up, deeply feel that the free and happy life I am living today is due to your and the Communist Party's correct leadership and the arduous struggle of the people of the whole country. I want to pay my respects to you with unparalleled reverence and enthusiasm, and report to you the progress and ideological transformation of a woman who suffered from double oppression in the old society after two years of liberation under the education of the Communist Party.

　　I was born into a feudal landlord family and worked as an elementary school teacher in the old society for more than ten years. After liberation, I still had the aloofness of being detached from politics and held a mercenary view of work. I was a backward element.

　　The Party's policy is great. For the sake of revolutionary interests, it is constantly educating, transforming, and uniting the broad masses of intellectuals. In the summer of 1949, all educational workers in Beijing began their first study. Only then did I initially understand the law of social development and realize that the founding of New China was a earth-shattering transformation, a great emancipation of the working people of the whole country, fundamentally different from the change of dynasties in the past. Then, in my own work post, I received the leadership and education of the Party every day. In particular, the active work of Comrade Zhai Lin, the principal of our school, a Party member, his responsible work style for the people, and his patient education of backward colleagues deeply moved me. I gradually felt the corruption, narrowness, and selfishness of my past life, began to criticize my work attitude, and established the view of serving the people.

　　The vigorous movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea once again educated me and made me feel that it was glorious and proud to be a victorious Chinese people. I must wash away all the stains on myself to be worthy of being a people's teacher and to educate the next generation of New China. When I conducted patriotic education for children; when I carried out propaganda on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries to students' parents and street residents; when I took on the role of organization member of the Fifth District Educational Workers' Trade Union to understand the family situation and ideological situation of all member comrades, my heart was surging with my true feelings of loving the motherland, and my mind was undergoing a sharp struggle.

　　I have three children. My husband, Yang Rongting, is a reactionary. He received a university education poisoned by American cultural aggression, worked as an inspector for the "剿共委员会 (剿匪总指挥部)" of the Japanese puppet regime, and worked as a political instructor for the "208th Division" of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group. After liberation, he always refused to study, did not seek progress, and opposed the People's Government. He initially told me "don't be poisoned by the Communist Party," "don't flatter the Communist Party for millet," and told me to "say one thing outside and obey my husband at home." He not only hindered my study, but also constantly shook my will to progress, and even used his reactionary ideas to poison me. Thanks to the education of the Party, I have the strength to be strong. I faced my reactionary husband, but I kept in mind the heroic revolutionary fighters, especially the volunteer soldiers who selflessly sacrificed for the broad masses of the people. Therefore, I began to despise my husband. However, I still fantasized about using my own strength to transform him and educate him, but I failed. He said, "Husband and wife should have the same thoughts. If you want to please your husband, you should listen to him, obey me, and only act the part at work."

　　Thank you for your and the Communist Party's leadership, and thank you to the school and the trade union organization for their cultivation and education, which have given me the ability to distinguish right from wrong and to distinguish between friends and enemies. I combined my own feelings with the people, combined my own future with the cause of the motherland, and I stood firm on the people's stand, divorced my reactionary husband, and reported his crime of hiding guns for two years without reporting it, handing over a reactionary who was once my beloved but now insists on a reactionary stance and violates the laws of the People's Government to my government. I think this is something a people's teacher should do.

　　After this happened, I immediately received the attention and care of the surrounding comrades and comrades from all walks of life in society. They cared about my life problems, work problems, and children's problems, which made me feel that only in the big family under the leadership of the Communist Party can these sincere friendships be produced, making me more trust and love the Party. In the future, I will dedicate all my strength to the people's education and strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

　　With best regards and wishing you eternal health.

　　                                   Wang Jinghua, Teacher of Rongxian Hutong Elementary School, Beijing Municipality

### 党给了我坚强的力量  我检举了反动的丈夫——小学教员汪荆华给毛主席的信

　　党给了我坚强的力量
    我检举了反动的丈夫         
     ——小学教员汪荆华给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    纪念伟大的共产党三十周年纪念日，我和已经站起来的人民一样，深切感到：自己今天过的自由幸福的日子，都是您和共产党的正确领导以及全国人民的艰苦斗争换来的。我要以无比尊崇和热烈的心情向您致敬，并向您报告：在旧社会中一个受双重压迫的妇女，解放两年来在共产党的教育下争取进步和思想转变的经过。
    我出身在封建的地主家庭，在旧社会做过十几年小学教师，解放后仍存在着脱离政治的清高思想，抱着雇佣观点作工作，是一个落后分子。
    党的政策是伟大的，为了革命利益，无时无刻不在教育、改造和团结广大的知识分子。一九四九年的暑期，全北京市教育工作者开始了第一次学习，我才初步了解社会发展的规律，认识到新中国的成立，是一个天翻地覆的大转变，是全国劳动人民大翻身，和过去改朝换代根本不同。接着在自己工作岗位上我每天都接受着党的领导和教育，尤其是我校的党员同志翟林校长的积极工作，为人民负责任的作风，和对落后同仁的耐心教育，深深感动了我。我渐渐感到过去生活的腐化、狭隘、自私，开始批判了自己的工作态度，建立了为人民服务的观点。
    轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，再一次教育了我，使我感觉到做一个胜利了的中国人民是光荣的、骄傲的。我必须洗净本身一切污点，才配做一个人民教师，才能教育新中国的下一代。当我对儿童进行爱国主义教育的时候；对学生家长和街道群众进行抗美援朝、镇压反革命宣传的时候；当我担任起五区教育工作者工会组织委员向全体会员同志了解家庭情况、思想情况的时候，我的心里激荡着我热爱祖国的真正感情，我的思想上起着尖锐的斗争。
    我有三个孩子。我的丈夫杨荣庭是一个反动分子。他受过美国文化侵略毒化的大学教育，做过日伪的“剿共委员会”视察，做过蒋介石反动集团的“二○八师”的政治教官。解放后他始终拒绝学习，不求进步，与人民政府对立。他最初叫我“不要中了共产党的‘毒’”，“不要为小米拍共产党的马屁”，叫我“在外面说外面的一套，回家就要服从丈夫听丈夫的话”。他不但阻碍我学习，更时刻动摇着我进步的意志，甚至用他的反动思想来毒化我。感谢党的教育给了我坚强的力量。我面对反动的丈夫，但我的脑海里紧紧地记着英勇的革命战士们，尤其是为了广大人民忘我牺牲的志愿军战士们。因此我开始鄙视我的丈夫。但是，我仍幻想用自己的力量改造他，教育他，结果我失败了。他说：“夫妇思想应该一致，你要得到丈夫的欢心就应该听丈夫的话，服从我，对工作只能逢场做戏。”
    感谢您和共产党的领导，感谢学校和工会组织的培养和教育，使我有了辨明是非，分清敌友的能力。我把自己的感情和人民大众结合在一起，把自己的前途和祖国的事业结合在一起，我站稳了人民的立场，和反动丈夫离了婚，并检举他藏匿枪支两年不报的罪行，把一个过去曾是我最爱的，而现在坚持反动立场，违反人民政府法令的反动分子交给了我的政府。我认为这是一个人民教师应该做的事情。
    这事发生后，我立刻得到周围的同志和社会上各阶层同志的重视和关怀。他们关心我的生活问题，工作问题，孩子问题，使我感到只有在共产党领导下的大家庭中才能产生这些真挚的友情，使我更相信党，更爱党。以后我更要献出自己所有力量为人民教育而努力，并且争取做一个光荣的共产党员。
    此致敬礼  并祝您永远健康
                            北京市市立绒线胡同小学教员  汪荆华
