　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd (TASS dispatch): On June 29th, Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, received a delegation from the American "Veterans for Peace" Association, an organization uniting peace advocates among American veterans who participated in World War II. The delegation raised questions about Soviet foreign policy and the lives of the Soviet people, and Malik answered them in detail one by one.

　　Malik emphasized that the Soviet Union has consistently defended the cause of peace in the past and present and has implemented a policy of cooperation with all countries that wish to cooperate. The Soviet Union poses no threat to anyone because the Soviet Union has no aggressive plans, nor can it have any.

　　Malik said that the Soviet Union's peace policy stems from the fundamental principles of the Soviet social system and the interests of the Soviet people. In 1932, Comrade Stalin, in answering the question posed by American journalist Barnes, "Is it possible to convince the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the United States that an armed conflict between the two countries will never occur under any circumstances?" replied, "It is very easy to convince the people of the two countries of the harm and sin of mutual destruction. But unfortunately, the issue of peace and war is not always decided by the people. I have no doubt that the American people did not want to fight against the Soviet people in 1918-1919. However, this did not prevent the American government from attacking the Soviet Union in 1918 along with Japan, Britain, and France, and continuing armed intervention against the Soviet Union until 1919. As for the Soviet Union, there is almost no need to prove that the Soviet people and the Soviet government do not want an armed conflict between the two countries under any circumstances."

　　Malik urged the delegation to note that no American newspaper published a response to the extremely important principle of Soviet foreign policy that Comrade Stalin spoke of in that conversation.

　　Malik also told the delegation about a fact that illustrates how American propaganda agencies deceive the American people to keep them from knowing about this most important statement of the Soviet Union regarding its peace policy. American radio and television stations requested the Soviet representative to the United Nations to give them a summary of his broadcast speech. Malik satisfied their requests. In this summary, the most important principles of Soviet peaceful diplomacy were discussed, including Stalin's aforementioned conversation about Soviet-American relations. However, it was later discovered that the most important part of the speech was deleted from the radio, television, and newsreels. Malik concluded from this that the monopoly capital groups that control all American propaganda tools (newspapers, radio, movies, and television) deliberately concealed from the American people the Soviet Union's proposals aimed at consolidating peace and Soviet-American friendship.

　　Subsequently, the representatives of the veterans said that the arms expansion movement, the aggression against Korea, and the so-called "Cold War" policy pursued by the American ruling groups have increasingly increased the already heavy tax burden on the American people. They also said that the American aggression against Korea has aroused indignation among broad sections of the American people.

　　One representative said that the delegation of the World Peace Council had intended to come to New York to present the proposals on peace issues adopted by the World Peace Congress and the appeal to the United Nations, but the State Department did not allow them to enter the country, and American progressives expressed extreme indignation at this action.

　　Malik said to the representatives: Obviously, the American ruling groups are really afraid of the peace movement, and it is precisely for this reason that they do not allow the delegation of the World Peace Council to enter the country.

　　The delegation handed Malik a petition signed by sixteen veterans of the association, calling on all American veterans to fight for peace. The petition pointed out that the "Veterans for Peace Association" had consulted with many soldiers who participated in World War II, and 83 percent of them expressed support for the immediate withdrawal of American troops from abroad and the cessation of the Korean War.

　　苏联驻联合国代表马立克
    接见美国“争取和平退伍军人会”代表团
    阐释苏联和平政策并斥美国宣传机构蒙蔽人民
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社纽约三日讯：六月二十九日，苏联驻联合国代表马立克接见美国“争取和平退伍军人会”的代表团，这个组织团结了曾参加第二次世界大战的美国退伍军人中的和平拥护者。代表团就苏联的外交政策和苏联人民的生活提出一些问题，马立克逐一加以详细的解答。
    马立克强调指出：苏联过去和现在始终不变地捍卫和平事业，并执行着与一切希望合作的国家合作的政策。苏联对任何人都没有威胁，因为苏联没有、也不可能有任何侵略计划。
    马立克说：苏联的和平政策导源于苏维埃社会制度的根本原则与苏联人民的利益。一九三二年斯大林同志在回答美国记者巴纳斯所提“有没有可能使苏联人民与美国人民相信两国之间决不会、而且在任何情况下都不会发生武装冲突？”的问题时曾回答说：“使两国人民相信互相毁灭的害处和罪恶是再容易不过了。但不幸的是：和平与战争问题并不总是由人民决定的。我毫不怀疑，美国人民大众在一九一八年——一九一九年并不愿意和苏联人民作战。但是美国政府并没有因此就不在一九一八年与日本、英国和法国一道向苏联进攻，并且继续对苏联实行武装干涉，直到一九一九年。至于苏联，几乎无须证明苏联人民和苏联政府都不希望两国在任何情况下发生武装冲突。”
    马立克促请代表团注意，没有一家美国报纸刊载过对斯大林同志在那次谈话中所说的苏联外交政策极其重要的原则的反应。
    马立克并向代表团谈到一个事实，说明美国宣传机构怎样蒙蔽美国人民使他们不知道苏联关于苏联和平政策的这项最重要的声明。美国各电台与电视站曾要求苏联驻联合国代表给它们一份他的广播演说摘要。马立克满足了它们的要求。在这个摘要中谈到了苏联和平外交政策的最重要的原则，同时也包括了斯大林关于苏美关系的上述谈话。可是，后来发现，广播、电视、新闻片都把演说中这个最重要的部分删去了。马立克由此得出结论说：掌握着美国一切宣传工具（报纸、电台、电影与电视）的垄断资本集团，故意向美国人民隐讳苏联旨在巩固和平与美苏友好关系的建议。
    接着，退伍军人的代表们说：美国统治集团所奉行的扩充军备运动、对朝鲜的侵略以及所谓“冷战”政策，越来越加重了美国人民已经沉重的税收负担。他们又说：美国对朝鲜的侵略激起了美国人民广大阶层的愤慨。
    一位代表说：世界和平理事会的代表团曾打算来纽约提出世界和平大会所通过的关于和平问题的建议与致联合国的呼吁书，可是国务院不准他们入境，美国进步人士对这种行动极表愤慨。
    马立克对代表们说：显然，美国统治集团实在害怕和平运动，正是因为这个原因，他们才不准世界和平理事会的代表团入境。
    代表团递交马立克一件由该会十六名退伍军人署名的呼吁书，其中号召美国全体退伍军人为争取和平而斗争，呼吁书指出：“争取科平退伍军人会”曾经征询过许多参加第二次世界大战的士兵，其中有百分之八十三的人表示支持立即把美国军队自国外撤回和停止朝鲜战争。
