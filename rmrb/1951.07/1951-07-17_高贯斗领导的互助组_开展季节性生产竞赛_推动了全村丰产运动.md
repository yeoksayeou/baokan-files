Gao Guandou Leads Mutual Aid Team in Seasonal Production Competition
　　Promoting Village-Wide Bumper Harvest Movement
　　Gao Guandou, a famous agricultural labor model in Hebei Province, leads the production mutual aid team in Dahu Jia Village, Shen County, and organizes the villagers to launch seasonal production competitions, which powerfully promotes the village-wide bumper harvest movement.
　　Before the start of the seasonal production competition, the CCP branch and the village people's government in Dahu Jia Village seriously studied the call of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on strengthening the leadership of the patriotic production competition movement. The village women's federation, production technology committee, etc., also mobilized the masses to deliberate on the issue of carrying out production competitions. After the above research and deliberation, the village party and government leading organs decided to carry out a competition centered on summer harvest and summer seed selection throughout the village. The mutual aid teams in the village, which had accepted the challenge of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, took the lead in mobilizing more than twenty mutual aid teams in the village to challenge and accept challenges from each other, thereby promoting the participation of villagers in this competition. In the seed selection work, labor model Gao Guandou adopted the method of marking good plants and good ears with colored thread in the wheat field, so that the wheat seeds selected this year were much better than the seeds selected in the wheat field last year. More than two hundred households in nearby Wudao Street immediately learned from him, thus rapidly expanding the seed selection work throughout the village and achieving great results. Every household in the village selected and retained fine varieties of wheat. During the harvest, the mutual aid team led by CCP member Gao Dongchen in the village first organized the team's able-bodied and semi-able-bodied labor force, harvesting wheat at night and sowing seeds during the day, with men sowing and women threshing. Their actions promoted other mutual aid teams. In this way, nearly a thousand able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village went to the fields together, harvesting day and night. The village's three thousand mu of wheat fields were harvested in three days, twice as fast as last year, and autumn crops were planted in time. During the competition, labor model Gao Guandou and village cadres also regularly went to the mutual aid teams and households to check and provide guidance at any time. Because the peasants further realized the benefits of labor mutual aid, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid teams increased from 80% of the total number of households in the village during spring plowing to 100%. Gao Guandou and other seven mutual aid teams also completed the plan proposed in their challenge to the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team to plant all fine varieties.
　　After the summer harvest and summer seed selection competition, the village immediately conducted evaluation and summarization by street, and selected seven model mutual aid teams and ten model households. Now, the mutual aid teams and peasant households in the village are putting away their hoes, purchasing fertilizers, and enthusiastically launching a summer hoeing and topdressing competition.

　　高贯斗领导的互助组
　　开展季节性生产竞赛
　  推动了全村丰产运动
    河北省著名农业劳动模范高贯斗，领导深县大护驾庄的生产互助组，组织全村农民展开季节性的生产竞赛，有力地推进了全村的丰产运动。
    在季节性的生产竞赛开始以前，大护驾庄的中共支部和村人民政府，曾认真地研究了中央人民政府农业部关于加强爱国主义生产竞赛运动的领导的号召。该村妇女联合会、生产技术委员会等，又分别动员群众对开展生产竞赛的问题进行了酝酿。经过上述研究和酝酿以后，该村党政领导机关决定在全村开展以夏收、夏选为中心的竞赛。该村向李顺达互助组应战的各互助组首先积极带头，发动全村二十多个互助组互相挑战应战，因而推动全村农民参加了这一竞赛。在选种工作中，劳动模范高贯斗采用了以花线在麦田标好棵、好穗的方法，使今年所选的麦种比去年在麦田中片选的种子好得多。附近五道街的二百多户人家马上跟他学起来，因而使全村的选种工作迅速展开，并有了很大成绩，全村家家都选留了麦子良种。收割时，该村中共党员高栋臣领导的互助组，首先组织全组男女整半劳动力，晚上拔麦，白天播种，男的播种，女的打场。他们的行动推动了别的互助组。这样全村近千个男女整半劳动力，就一齐下地，日夜不停地进行收割。全村的三千亩麦田，三天即收割完毕，较去年快了一倍，并及时种上了秋禾。竞赛中，劳动模范高贯斗和村干部们，还经常到各互助组、各户去检查，随时给以指导。由于农民们进一步认识了劳动互助的好处，参加互助组的农户由春耕时占全村总户数的百分之八十，增到了百分之百。高贯斗等七个互助组并完成了向李顺达互助组应战中所提全部种优良品种的计划。
    夏收夏选竞赛结束后，该村即按街道进行评比总结，评选出七个模范互助组和十个模范户。现在，该村各互助组、各户农民正在收拾锄头，添购肥料，热烈展开夏锄追肥竞赛。
