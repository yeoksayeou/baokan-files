Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th: The Tianjin Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on the 13th, announcing the banning of the reactionary secret organization "Legion of Mary," which is manipulated by imperialism. The "Legion of Mary" (also known as the "Servants of Mary," or the "Marian Prayer Association") is one of the international counter-revolutionary organizations manipulated by imperialism to carry out sabotage activities against people's democratic countries. The "Legion of Mary" in Tianjin was directly organized and led by imperialist elements on the eve of liberation and continued to develop after liberation, collecting reactionary elements as its backbone, deceiving the masses, and consistently engaging in activities to undermine the People's Republic of China. Under the guise of evangelism, it spread counter-revolutionary rumors, distributed counter-revolutionary propaganda, and undermined the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the patriotic youth's participation in military and cadre schools, and the Three-Self Reform Movement of Catholics. As the people's awareness has been increasing, imperialist elements have tried to struggle. A Dutch expatriate, Man Jishi, led counter-revolutionary elements such as Wang Keming to secretly form societies, plotting to create riots and organizing fights and assassinations, carrying out counter-revolutionary activities by means of terror. Their reactionary madness has fully proved that they are by no means a religious group. In order to protect the interests of the people and maintain social order, the Tianjin Military Control Commission stipulates that all levels of "Legion of Mary" organizations be immediately dissolved from the date of the proclamation and shall not engage in any activities; in addition to the counter-revolutionary elements who have been arrested shall be punished in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," the general branch "staff" and above must register with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, hand over reactionary organizations and documents, confess all reactionary activities, and after a clear explanation, the government will give lenient treatment, the general "members" must declare to the Public Security Bureau that they withdraw from this reactionary organization and stop activities, the government will not pursue.

　　天津市军事管制委员会布告
    取缔国际性反革命组织“圣母军”
    宣布对已捕反革命分子将依法惩办
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津市军事管制委员会于十三日发出布告，宣布对帝国主义操纵的反动秘密组织“圣母军”实行取缔。按“圣母军”（又名“圣母御侍团”、“圣母慈爱祈祷会”）是帝国主义操纵的用以对人民民主国家进行破坏活动的国际性反革命组织之一。在天津的“圣母军”，即为帝国主义分子于解放前夕直接组织与领导，解放后继续发展，搜罗反动分子为骨干，欺骗群众，一贯进行破坏中华人民共和国的活动，以传教为名传播反革命谣言，散发反革命宣传品，并破坏抗美援朝运动、爱国青年参加军干校运动，以及天主教徒的三自革新运动。在人民觉悟日益提高之时，帝国主义分子力图挣扎，由荷兰侨民满济世领导反革命分子王克明等秘密结社，阴谋制造暴乱，组织斗殴暗害，以恐怖手段肆行反革命活动。其反动疯狂至此，已充分证明其绝非宗教信仰之团体。天津市军事管制委员会为保障人民利益，维护社会秩序，特规定自布告日起所有“圣母军”各级组织立即解散，不得再有任何活动；除已捕反革命分子应按“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”予以惩处外，一般支会“职员”以上分子须向市公安局进行登记，交出反动组织、证件，坦白一切反动活动，交代清楚后，政府予以宽大处理，一般“团员”须向公安局声明退出此一反动组织，停止活动，政府不予追究。
