　　Resolutely Fight Against Corruption and Waste
    The corruption and illegal activities that occurred in the Tangshan branch of the China Grain Company in Hebei Province and the Jinan Municipal People's Government's Industrial Bureau, involving so many people and causing such great losses to the state and the people, are shocking. Certain key personnel in these two units—many of whom are Communist Party members—have forgotten the important tasks entrusted to them by the Party, the government, and the people. They have placed the interests of their departments and their personal interests above the interests of the state and the people without any principle. They have shielded and indulged derelict and illegal cadres, refused to allow the masses to expose corruption, and resisted inspections by the leadership. They have also adopted completely wrong attitudes towards other departments of the state. For example, the Jinan Municipal People's Government's Industrial Bureau illegally evaded taxes, causing many difficulties for the state tax authorities in their work. They completely lost their vigilance in the face of some illegal private merchants, resulting in the embezzlement of a large amount of state assets, and they could not resist the temptation of bad elements, even going so far as to collude with them. It is clear from these two corruption cases that all individualism and departmentalism, when developed to the extreme, can lead to corruption and degeneration, causing one to completely degenerate politically. This should arouse everyone's vigilance, especially the high vigilance of economic workers. Although such corruption incidents are isolated, phenomena similar to this kind of individualism and departmentalism are not isolated, and the losses caused by them are also serious.
    The Party's principles cannot be lowered. State laws cannot be violated. The personnel involved in corruption in the Tangshan branch of the China Grain Company have already been punished by Party discipline and the law, which is absolutely necessary. The corruption incident in the Jinan Municipal People's Government's Industrial Bureau is still awaiting prompt handling by the local Party and government leading organs. In addition, and more importantly, all economic workers should strengthen their political study, raise their awareness, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all corruption and waste.

　　要和贪污浪费现象作不调和的斗争
    中国粮食公司河北省唐山分公司和济南市人民政府工业局所发生的贪污违法事件，牵连的人员之多，给国家人民造成的损失之大，是惊人的。这两个单位某些主要工作人员，——其中很多是共产党员，他们已经忘了党、政府和人民所交给自己的重大任务。他们毫无原则地把本部门的利益，和个人利益放在国家与人民的利益之上。他们包庇纵容失职、违法干部，拒绝群众揭发贪污，抵抗领导方面检查工作。对国家其他部门，也采取了完全错误的态度。如济南市人民政府工业局违法偷税、漏税，给国家税务机关工作上造成了很多困难。他们在一些不法私商面前，完全失去警觉，致使大量国家资财被骗取，经不起坏分子的引诱，竟至同流合污。从这两件贪污案中看得很清楚：一切个人主义、本位主义，发展到极端，就可能走上贪污腐化，使自己在政治上完全蜕化。这应引起大家的警惕，特别是应引起经济工作者的高度警惕。虽然，像这样的贪污事件，是个别的，但类似这种个人主义、本位主义的现象，却不是个别的，由此造成的损失也是严重的。
    党的原则不容降低。国家法律不容违犯。中国粮食公司唐山分公司与贪污有关的工作人员，已经受到了党纪和法律的制裁，这完全必要。济南市人民政府工业局的贪污事件，尚有待当地党政领导机关迅速处理。此外，更重要的是：一切经济工作者应加强自己的政治学习，提高自己的觉悟，要和一切贪污浪费现象作不调和的斗争。
