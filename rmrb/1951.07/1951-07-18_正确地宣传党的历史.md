　　Correctly Publicize the History of the Party

　　To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Party and non-Party newspapers across the country have, since mid-to-late June, devoted significant space to publicizing the Party, especially the history of the Party's struggles.

　　During this period, local newspapers published many popular articles on the history of the Party's struggles, including vivid recollections by leading Party cadres and veteran Party members of the Party's revolutionary struggles in various revolutionary periods and regions. In this regard, the Changjiang Daily and New Hunan Daily in the Central South District, the Liberation Daily in the East China District, and the Masses Daily in the Northwest District have done a commendable job. Some articles published in the Changjiang Daily and New Hunan Daily recounted the early workers' movement in Hunan led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the workers' and peasants' movements during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan and Hubei in 1927, the Xiangnan Uprising in 1928, the establishment and development of revolutionary base areas in the Central South District during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Long March of the Red Army, and the subsequent persistent revolutionary struggles of the people of Hunan and Jiangxi. These recollections of revolutionary history are of great educational significance to both Party members and non-Party members. The Liberation Daily published reports on the Party's leadership of the people of western Fujian in their persistent revolutionary struggles for twenty years, as well as many materials on the history of the Party's organizational leadership in the anti-Japanese war in Shandong. It also reported on the history of struggle of some Party branches with a history of more than ten or even twenty years, such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, the Shanghai Customs, Jiaotong University, the State-owned Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Mill, and the Wing On Company, vividly recounting the underground struggles led by the Party and the close connection between the Party and the working class. These articles have greatly enriched the publicity of Party history in the newspapers.

　　However, some of the articles in local newspapers outlining the history of the Party's struggles are inappropriate.

　　The Hunan Mass Daily has been publishing a popular serialized article, "A Brief History of the Communist Party of China," since June 21st. As of the time we wrote this article, it had published sections such as "The 'July 1st' Thirty Years Ago," "How the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Cooperated," "The Northern Expedition," and "The Land Revolutionary War." The first section discussed the Party's first congress on July 1st thirty years ago, but lacked an adequate explanation of the historical background of the Party's founding. The second section discussed the establishment of the united front between the Party and the Kuomintang led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, but only briefly mentioned the workers' movement led by the Party after its founding at the beginning of the second section, writing: "After the founding of the Communist Party of China, it first conducted revolutionary activities among the workers, and then established a cooperative relationship with Sun Yat-sen." The revolutionary activities carried out by the Party among the workers at that time were lightly passed over in a simple sentence.

　　The Central South Worker's Daily began publishing a serialized long article on Party knowledge on June 14th. After explaining the nature of the Party, the newspaper used "What Great Things Has the Communist Party of China Done?" as the general title, and made a serialized outline of the history of the Party's struggles. Here, the newspaper also mentioned the united front between the Party and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang and the First Domestic Revolutionary War after narrating the Party's founding, without mentioning the extensive development of the Chinese workers' movement after the Party's founding.

　　Such publicity is incomplete. Obviously, without an adequate explanation of the historical background of the Communist Party of China, people cannot truly understand the great significance of the founding of the working class party. The workers' movement, which the Party concentrated on leading for two years after its founding, is an inseparable part of the Party's history. This period of history shows "the rapid growth of the organizational strength and revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class, thereby greatly enhancing the political prestige of the working class and the Communist Party of China among the people of the whole country" (Hu Qiaomu: "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China"). This period of history is an important explanation of the Party as the vanguard of the working class and the close connection between the Party and the working class from beginning to end.

　　At present, a large part of the working masses still do not understand the true relationship between the Party and the working class. A discussion held by the Central South Worker's Daily fully proves this. From June 24th, the newspaper continuously published workers' readers' discussions on the question of "Where did the Communist Party of China come from?" As of the time we wrote this article, it had not yet ended. This discussion reflected various divergent opinions. Some workers said that the Communist Party came from the peasants; some said it came from the poor; some said it came from the intellectuals, but they must have the help of workers; some said it was produced from the workers, but they must have the leadership of intellectuals; some said it was produced from "thought," and so on. This discussion by the Central South Worker's Daily shows that many workers lack a correct understanding of the nature of the Party and the relationship between the Party and the working class. It also tells us that it is very necessary to appropriately explain the history of the Party's workers' movement to the working masses.

　　Peasant newspapers have the same shortcomings in their publicity of Party history. At present, many rural cadre Party members still have many confused views on the nature of the Party. It is also very necessary to correctly explain the relationship between the Party and the working class and the history of the Party's leadership of the workers' movement in peasant newspapers.

　　The shortcomings in the newspaper's Party history publicity are not limited to the above. On June 18th, the Hebei Daily published propaganda materials for propagandists entitled "The Communist Party of China is the Savior of the Chinese People." This article outlined the history of the Party's thirty-year struggle and said: "Just speaking of the big ones, there have been three major revolutions. The first was the ten-year Land Revolutionary War. The Communist Party of China created the first and most conscious and disciplined people's revolutionary army, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (which is the predecessor of the current People's Liberation Army), established the first workers' and peasants' regime in Chinese history, and led the patriotic movement throughout the country. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it led the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism. During the three-year War of Liberation, it led the Chinese people to annihilate eight million Kuomintang bandit troops, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establish our own people's country - the People's Republic of China..." Here, the author narrated the three "major revolutions," and lightly obliterated the entire revolutionary historical stage of the Party from 1921 to 1927. Such a serious omission is inexcusable.

　　The Guangxi Daily from June 20th to 21st and the Guilin Daily of Guangxi from June 25th to 27th reprinted a propaganda material for propagandists compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, entitled "Commemorating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China." The section "What Meritorious Deeds Has the Communist Party of China Done for the People" listed six major events according to the progress of history. The author actually divided it into six stages according to the history of the Party's revolutionary struggle, but if this is the case, the author should divide it into: from the founding of the Party to before the establishment of the first united front with the Kuomintang; the First Domestic Revolutionary War; the Second Domestic Revolutionary War; the Anti-Japanese War; the Third Domestic Revolutionary War; after the founding of the People's Republic of China. However, the article mentioned above is not divided in this way. The author omitted the first stage and listed "September 18th" to "July 7th" as one stage, which is inappropriate.

　　The Wanbei Mass Daily published a special article on July 1st entitled "Celebrating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China." The article narrated the history of the Party's thirty-year struggle and said: "In these thirty years, the Party and the Party's leader, Chairman Mao, led the Chinese people in a difficult and long-term revolutionary war and won a great victory. The first battle defeated the running dogs of imperialism, the Northern Warlords; the second battle defeated another running dog of imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, who stood in the way on the 25,000-li Long March; the third battle defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dog Wang Jingwei; the fourth battle finally overthrew the rule of the United States and all imperialists in China and their running dogs Chiang Kai-shek and all reactionaries, and established the great People's Republic of China." Here, the entire historical stage of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War is simply described as "defeating Chiang Kai-shek who stood in the way on the 25,000-li Long March," which is inappropriate.

　　The "North China People" magazine published a set of comic strips entitled "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" in its July issue. This set of comic strips was also reprinted by the combined issue of the sixth and seventh issues of the "Learning" elementary edition and the "China Youth Daily" on June 26th. It is good to use this form to make popular publicity of the history of the Party, but due to the lack of seriousness on the part of the compilers and proofreaders, some mistakes have occurred. For example, the description in the thirteenth picture first narrates that the Party held its sixth national congress in July 1928 and decided to implement the land revolution and establish a worker-peasant democratic regime. Then it said that from 1929 to 1930, Chairman Mao built revolutionary base areas in the countryside. Such a narrative is contrary to historical facts. Chairman Mao decided to implement revolutionary separatism and establish revolutionary base areas as early as October 1927. The scene of the enemy attacking Yan'an in the twenty-sixth picture is also contrary to historical facts and unreasonable. The Beijing Worker's Daily has been publishing the biographical stories of famous leading comrades in the history of the Chinese workers' movement, such as Su Zhaozheng, Deng Zhongxia, and Zhu Baoting, in the "Cultural Palace" column on the third page of the newspaper since June 21st, entitled "Biography of Martyrs," for a total of nine articles by June 30th. Among them, except for two new works, the rest are old works from several years ago or even more than ten years ago, which are no longer appropriate to publish now. The editors of the newspaper did not revise or explain these old articles when they published them, and even failed to indicate the original time and which book they were reprinted from in four articles. This is not right.

　　Newspaper editors must carefully study the history of the Party. Only by continuous and hard study can we be competent for our important tasks on the ideological front.

### 正确地宣传党的历史

　　正确地宣传党的历史
    为了庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年，全国各地党和非党的报纸从六月中下旬起，都以重要的篇幅进行了关于党的宣传，特别是关于党的斗争历史的宣传。
    各地报纸在这一时期发表了许多关于党的斗争历史的通俗文字，包括党的负责干部及老党员关于党在各个革命时期和各个地区进行革命斗争的生动的回忆。在这一方面，中南区的长江日报和新湖南报、华东区的解放日报和西北区的群众日报是做得有成绩的。发表在长江日报和新湖南报上的一些文章，记述了毛泽东同志领导的湖南初期工人运动和第一次国内革命战争时期的工人运动、农民运动，一九二七年的两湖秋收起义，一九二八年的湘南起义，和第二次国内革命战争时期中南区各革命根据地的建立和发展，红军长征和此后湘赣人民的坚持革命斗争等事迹。这些革命历史的回忆对于党员和非党员都有很大的教育意义。解放日报发表了关于党领导闽西人民坚持革命斗争二十年的报道及关于党在山东的组织领导抗日战争的斗争史的许多材料，并报道了一些有十几年乃至二十几年历史的党支部，如上海电力公司、法商水电公司、上海海关、交通大学、国营上海第十二棉纺织厂、永安公司等支部的斗争历史，生动地记述了党所领导的地下斗争和党与工人阶级的始终无间的紧密的联系。这些文章使报纸上关于党史的宣传大大地充实和丰富起来了。
    但是，在各地报纸概述党的斗争历史的文章中，有一些是不适当的。
    湖南大众报从六月二十一日起发表了通俗的连载文章《中国共产党简史》，到我们作这篇文章时为止，已发表了《三十年前的“七一”》，《国共怎样合作起来的》，《北伐战争》，《土地革命战争》等节。第一节中讲了三十年前七月一日党的第一次代表大会，而对于党的创立的历史背景缺乏适当的说明；第二节讲了第一次国内革命战争中，党与孙中山先生领导的国民党之间的统一战线的建立，而对于党成立之后所领导的工人运动却仅在第二节的开始时这样写道：“中国共产党成立后，首先就在工人中间进行革命活动，然后又与孙中山建立合作的关系”。关于当时党在工人中所进行的革命活动，简单一句话就轻轻地带过去了。
    中南工人日报从六月十四日起发表了关于党的知识的连载长文。在说明了党的性质之后，该报以《中国共产党做过那些大事情》为总题，作了关于党的斗争历史的连载概述。在这里，该报也是在叙述了党的成立之后，接着就说到了党与孙中山先生的国民党之间的统一战线和第一次国内革命战争，根本没有提到中国工人运动在党成立以后的广泛的发展。
    这样的宣传是不完整的。显然，对中国共产党产生的历史背景不加以适当的说明，就不能使人真正理解工人阶级政党的创立的伟大意义。党在成立之后两年间集中力量领导的工人运动，是党的历史中不可分割的一部分，这段历史显示了“工人阶级组织力量和革命积极性的迅速增长，因而大大提高了工人阶级和中国共产党在全国人民中的政治威信”（胡乔木：《中国共产党的三十年》）。这段历史是党作为工人阶级的先锋队和党与工人阶级的自始至终的紧密联系的重要说明。
    目前在工人群众中还有很大一部分人不了解党和工人阶级的真正关系。中南工人日报所举行的一个讨论就充分证明了这一点。六月二十四日起，该报连续发表了工人读者关于“中国共产党是从那里来的”问题的讨论，到我们写作这篇文章的时候还没有结束，在这个讨论中反映出各种分歧的意见，有的工人说共产党是从农民那里来的；有的说是从穷人里面来的；有的说是从读书人里面来的，但必须有工人帮助；有的说是从工人里面产生的，但必须有知识分子领导；有的说是从“思想上”产生的等等。中南工人日报的这个讨论显示出许多工人对于党的性质，党与工人阶级的关系缺乏正确的了解，也告诉了我们，把党进行工人运动的历史向工人群众加以适当说明是很有必要的。
    农民报纸关于党史的宣传有同样的缺点。目前还有许多农村干部党员对于党的性质存在着不少糊涂看法。在农民报纸上正确地说明党与工人阶级的关系、说明党领导工人运动的历史，也是很有必要的。
    报纸上的党史宣传的缺点并不以上述为限。六月十八日河北日报发表了以《中国共产党是中国人民的救星》为题的宣传员讲话材料，这篇文章概述党的三十年斗争历史说：“光说大的就有三次大革命，第一个是十年土地革命战争，中国共产党创立了咱们中国历史上第一支最觉悟最有纪律的人民革命军队工农红军（就是现在的人民解放军的前身），建立了咱们中国历史上第一个工农政权，还领导了全国的爱国运动。抗战八年，又领导中国人民打败了日本帝国主义。三年解放战争，领导中国人民，歼灭了国民党匪军八百万，推翻了国民党的反动统治，建立了咱人民自己的国家——中华人民共和国……”作者在这里叙述了三次“大革命”，把党在一九二一年到一九二七年的整个革命历史阶段的经过都轻轻抹煞了。这样严重的疏忽是不可原谅的。
    六月二十日到二十一日的广西日报和六月二十五日到二十七日广西桂林日报由中共广西省委宣传部编的《宣传员讲本》上转载了一篇宣传员讲话材料，题为《纪念中国共产党成立三十周年》，其中“中国共产党为人民立了些什么功劳”一节内按照历史的进展列举了六件大事。作者实际上是按照党进行革命斗争的历史分作六个阶段来叙述的，但如果是这样，作者就应该分为：由党的成立到与国民党建立第一次统一战线之前；第一次国内革命战争；第二次国内革命战争；抗日战争；第三次国内革命战争；中华人民共和国成立以后。但在前述的文章中，却不是这样划分的，作者略去了第一个阶段，而把“九一八”到“七七”列为一个阶段，这是不适当的。
    皖北大众报七月一日发表了专论《庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年》，文中叙述党三十年的斗争史道：“在这三十年中，党和党的领袖毛主席，领导中国人民进行艰苦的长期的革命战争，并赢得了伟大的胜利，第一仗打败了帝国主义的走狗北洋军阀；第二仗打败了帝国主义又一名走狗蒋介石在二万五千里长征路上的阻拦；第三仗打败了日本帝国主义及其走狗汪精卫，第四仗最后推翻了美国和一切帝国主义在中国的统治及其走狗蒋介石等一切反动派，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。”这里把第二次国内革命战争的整个历史阶段，只简单地说成了“打败了蒋介石在二万五千里长征路上的阻拦”，是不妥当的。
    “华北人民”杂志七月号刊载了一套《中国共产党三十年》的连环画，这套连环画同时被《学习》初级版第一卷第六、七期合刊及六月二十六日《中国青年报》所转载。用这种形式对党的历史作通俗的宣传是好的，但由于编制者和校阅者的态度不够认真，发生了一些错误。如第十三图的说明，先叙述一九二八年七月党召开了第六次全国代表大会，决定实行土地革命，建立工农民主政权，接着说，一九二九年到一九三○年，毛主席在乡村建设革命根据地。这样的叙述是违背历史事实的。毛主席决定实行革命割据、建立革命根据地，远在一九二七年十月。第二十六图画的敌人进攻延安的场面也是违背历史事实的，不合理的。北京工人日报从六月二十一日起在该报第三版《文化宫》一栏，以《烈士传》为题陆续刊载中国工人运动历史上著名领导同志苏兆征、邓中夏、朱宝庭等的传略故事，至六月三十日止，共九篇。其中除两篇是新作外，其余都是几年前甚至十几年前的旧作，在现在发表已不适当。该报编者在发表这些旧文章时，都未加以修正或说明，甚至有四篇连原作时间，转载何书都未注明。这是不对的。
    报纸的编辑人员必须认真学习党的历史。只有不断的刻苦学习，才能使我们胜任我们在思想战线上的重大任务。
