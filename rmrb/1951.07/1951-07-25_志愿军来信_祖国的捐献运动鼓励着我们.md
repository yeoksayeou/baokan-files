　　Volunteer Army Letter
    The Motherland's Donation Campaign Encourages Us
    Compatriots and Comrades of the Motherland!

    Since the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued its call on June 1st, we have been reading in the newspapers every day about how enthusiastically the people across the country have launched the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. In just over ten days, donations have been made for more than 150 airplanes. Not only adults but even children have joined this movement. This really moves us deeply.

    Compatriots and Comrades! We deeply cherish this great, new patriotic movement, because it is unprecedented in history. With more airplanes and cannons, we will annihilate more enemies. How much encouragement your patriotic actions give us! I assure you: we will resolutely and thoroughly fight to the end to resist America and aid Korea, and are always ready to shed the last drop of our blood on the Korean front, to be loyal to the motherland, in order to win victory at an early date. I will intensify my work and study every day, and together with my comrades, I will use our Sunday time to help the local peasant brothers with their work.

    It has only been a little over a year since the founding of our new China. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have overcome difficulties in all aspects and started construction in all fields, achieving great results. Together with the Korean People's Army, we have beaten the world's number one robber, American imperialism, to the point of bloodshed and annihilated more than 200,000 invading troops. How great is the strength of our motherland, and how bright is our future! I rejoice in the glory and happiness of the Chinese people living in the era of Mao Zedong.

    I thank you for your love for us, we will always live together. I wish you victory in your work and good health.

      Volunteer Army, A Certain Unit, Liu Datong, June 16

### 志愿军来信  祖国的捐献运动鼓励着我们

　　志愿军来信
    祖国的捐献运动鼓励着我们祖国的同胞们，同志们！
    自六月一日抗美援朝总会发出号召以来，我们每天从报纸上看到全国人民是那么热烈地展开了捐献飞机大炮运动。十多天的工夫，就捐献了飞机一百五十多架。不仅成年人，连儿童们都投入了这一运动。这实在使我们感动极了。
    同胞们，同志们！我们非常珍视这一个伟大的、新的爱国运动，因为这在历史上是没有过的。有了更多的飞机大炮，我们将更多地歼灭敌人。你们的爱国行动，给我们的鼓励多大啊！我向你们保证：坚决地、彻底地为抗美援朝而奋斗到底，并时时准备着把自己最后的一点血流在朝鲜前线上，尽忠祖国，以争取早日胜利。我每天要加紧工作和学习，还要和同志们一起，利用星期天的时间，帮助驻地的农民弟兄干活。
    我们新中国成立以来还只有一年多的时间，在毛主席的领导下，我们克服了各方面的困难，开始了各方面的建设，取得了伟大的成绩。我们和朝鲜人民军在一起，把世界上第一等的强盗美帝国主义打得头破血流，消灭了二十多万侵略军。我们祖国的力量多么伟大，我们的前途多么光明！我庆幸我们生在毛泽东时代的中国人民的光荣和幸福。
    我感谢你们对我们的热爱，我们永远是生活在一起的。敬祝你们工作胜利和身体健康。
      志愿军某部  刘大同  六月十六日
