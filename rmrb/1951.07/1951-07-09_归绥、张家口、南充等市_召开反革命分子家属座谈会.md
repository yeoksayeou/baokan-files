　　Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou and Nanchong Cities and Other Cities in Northern Sichuan Hold Symposiums for Families of Counter-Revolutionaries
　　The People's Governments of Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou and Nanchong Cities in the Northern Sichuan District, held symposiums for families of counter-revolutionaries in the middle of last month, which played a significant role in eliminating their concerns and raising their awareness of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
　　At the symposium in Nanchong City, after the person in charge of the city's People's Government finished speaking, Wu Wencui said emotionally: "I am ashamed that I am the family member of a counter-revolutionary, but I am very grateful to the People's Government for the policy of treating counter-revolutionaries and their families separately." At the symposium in Gui Sui City, more than eight out of ten attendees spoke. Some people said that although they did not agree with their relatives' counter-revolutionary activities in the past, they could not correct their behavior and lived in fear every day. After the arrest and conviction, they saw "one person commits a crime and one person is responsible", and their worries disappeared.
　　Through the symposium, the families of counter-revolutionaries were generally educated, ideologically separated from the counter-revolutionaries, and initially drew a line between the enemy and ourselves. Ge Peixia from Zhangjiakou said: "My husband, Zhang Zongyu, committed many crimes in the past. The government sent him to a training class to study in order to reform him. But he did not repent and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. It is right to kill him." Yang Chongzhen from Nanchong said: "I recognize that my special agent husband only treats me well, but many people have been harmed by him. He and I are on two different positions, and I ask the government to severely punish him." Some people, after reviewing their past mistakes of not reporting their counter-revolutionary relatives, said that they are willing to assist the government in collecting materials on counter-revolutionaries in the future. The wife of counter-revolutionary Xiong Zaihui (Nanchong) publicly stated at the meeting that her family was still hiding guns and bullets. She said: "I want to confess these weapons and all the secrets about counter-revolutionaries that I know to the People's Government. I also guarantee to regularly conduct propaganda to the families of counter-revolutionaries, so that they all understand the policies of the People's Government, and only by performing meritorious service can they be worthy of the people." Some people also expressed their determination to participate in labor production in the future. Ma Yuhua from Zhangjiakou said: "I will definitely listen to the government and work hard, and not learn from my counter-revolutionary husband."

　　归绥、张家口、南充等市
    召开反革命分子家属座谈会
    归绥、张家口和川北区南充等市人民政府，曾于上月中旬先后召开反革命分子家属座谈会，对消除他们的顾虑和提高他们对镇压反革命的认识起了很大作用。
    在南充市座谈会上，当该市人民政府负责人讲完话后，吴文萃激动地说：“我惭愧自己做了反革命分子的家属，但是我非常感激人民政府把反革命分子与其家属分别对待的政策。”在归绥市的座谈会上，十分之八以上的到会者都发了言。有些人表示，过去虽然不赞同其亲属作反革命活动，但是又不能纠正他们的行为，整天在提心吊胆中过日子，经逮捕治罪后，看到“一人犯罪一人当”，反而没有了顾虑。
    经过座谈，反革命分子的家属普遍受到教育，在思想上开始和反革命分子分家，初步划清敌我界限。张家口的葛佩霞说：“我丈夫张宗虞过去犯了很多罪，政府为了改造他曾送他到训练班学习。但是他死不改悔，仍继续进行反革命活动。杀他是对的。”南充的杨崇贞说：“我认清了我的特务丈夫只是待我一个人好，但是受他陷害的却有很多人。他和我是站在两个不同的立场上的，我要求政府严办他。”有的人在检讨了过去自己对反革命亲属不加检举的错误后，表示今后愿协助政府搜集反革命分子的材料。反革命分子熊在辉（南充）的妻子在会上当众说出她家里还藏匿着手枪和子弹。她说：“我要把这些武器和自己所知道的一切有关反革命分子的秘密都向人民政府坦白交代。我还保证要经常向反革命分子的家属进行宣传，使他们都了解人民政府的政策，只有将功赎罪才对得起人民。”有的人还表示了今后要参加劳动生产的决心。张家口的马玉花说：“我一定听政府的话，好好劳动，不向反革命丈夫学。”
