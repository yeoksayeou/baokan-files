Later, with the help of the production increase and donation committee, after re-conducting publicity and discussions among various firms, the donation figure was increased to 120 million yuan. The financial industry also decided to increase the six-month donation plan from 240 million yuan to 500 million yuan based on improving operations and increasing income. The production increase and donation committee is now preparing to further assist various industries in formulating or revising production increase plans to better carry out donation work.
