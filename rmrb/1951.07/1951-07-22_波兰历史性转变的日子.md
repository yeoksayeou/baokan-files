　　The Day of Poland's Historic Transformation
　　Sambrauski, Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party and Vice-Chairman of the Polish Parliament
　　July 22nd marks the seventh anniversary since People's Poland was born in the bloody and destructive flames of the war against Hitlerite fascism. People's Poland came into being due to the Soviet victory over Hitlerite fascism and the victorious struggle of the broad masses of the Polish people for national and social liberation. This is the first victorious revolution in the history of the Polish people. It enabled the Polish people, who had been heavily oppressed by the occupiers, to break free from Hitler's deep enslavement and, for the first time, fully realize the sovereignty of the Polish state and people. It overthrew the regime of Polish landlords and the bourgeoisie, classes that oppressed and exploited the working masses while serving foreign imperialism. It established the regime of urban and rural laborers, thereby guaranteeing the prosperity of the Polish people and the free development of all their creativity.

　　In the past seven years, we have made tremendous efforts to restore the national economy that was damaged by the war and have completed a leap forward unprecedented in Polish history.

　　In the twenty years between the two world wars, we were a weak country torn apart by internal contradictions, a country that treated the working class and peasants with white terror, a country that treated millions of Ukrainians and Belarusians with national oppression, and a country that was almost always at odds with all its neighbors. In the twenty years between the two world wars, we were a "pawn" on the chessboard of imperialist countries. The rulers handed our country over to foreign capitalists to be manipulated. The only manifestation of our independence during this period was the fact that, although Polish rulers changed their masters, they always remained within the sphere of influence of the imperialist countries leading the European anti-Soviet crusade.

　　Today, the plunder of Poland by foreign capitalists has ended forever. Today, our freedom and independence are built on the inviolable foundation of national and economic sovereignty. Today, the era in which our nation was both oppressed and oppressed other nations is gone forever. Today, our people belong to the great democratic and socialist camp and, for the first time in their history, are surrounded by friendly and benevolent neighbors.

　　We used to be an agricultural country with very underdeveloped industry. Polish workers, forced by unemployment, had to go to Western Europe and the Americas to make a living. Now we are transforming into an industrial country at an increasingly accelerated pace. The national census of 1931 showed that 61 percent of Polish residents were engaged in agriculture, and only 39 percent were engaged in other occupations. The national census of 1950 showed that 46 percent of residents were engaged in agriculture, while 54 percent were engaged in other industries. In seven years, we have restored, transformed, and rebuilt thousands of industrial enterprises, built houses for millions of people, revived Warsaw, cultivated vast areas of land that were previously unused, adjusted the agriculture and industry of the western regions, and built schools for millions of children and young people, improving the lives and cultural level of millions of people.

　　In the past seven years, we have created a strong industry. In 1951, industrial output per capita almost quadrupled compared to pre-war levels.

　　Pre-"September" (Editor's note: Poland announced the Land Reform Law on September 6, 1944.) Poland was a backward country with a surplus of rural population and suffering from a significant lack of arable land. Therefore, the first measure of the people's government was to implement a great land reform. As a result of the land reform, the landlord class was eliminated, and Polish peasants received more than six million hectares of land. The arable land waste that caused suffering to millions of peasants is a thing of the past. Now, hundreds of thousands of peasants and rural youth participate in industrial work, enter schools, and participate in large construction projects every year. Agricultural production has doubled in seven years. The yield per hectare has increased by 15 to 20 percent. The number of sheep and pigs has tripled in five years. There are approximately 28,000 tractors working in the fields of Poland. More than a quarter of the peasant economy, that is, more than 13,000 villages, uses electricity. In the twenty years before "September," only one-tenth of this number of rural areas in Poland used electricity. The total value of agricultural output, calculated per agricultural population, has exceeded the pre-war level by a factor of two.

　　Our country is undergoing a profound cultural revolution. The number of primary and secondary schools is increasing. Before the war, there were only 500 vocational schools; now there are 4,300. Before the war, there were only 29 institutions of higher education; now we have 79. The number of newspapers, magazines, and books is growing. The laborers have broken the propertied classes' monopoly on science and culture and are relying on the achievements of modern science to build socialism.

　　Friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union, and the fraternal assistance that the Soviet Union has given us since the birth of People's Poland, are the source of all our victories and achievements. The Soviet Union brought us national and social liberation and prevented the aggression of imperialist countries against our country. Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union, we regained the original Polish lands on the Oder and Neisse Rivers. In the first few years after liberation, we felt a lack of food, and the Soviet Union's help saved us from famine. When we embarked on the road of industrialization, the industrial equipment supplied by the Soviet Union enabled us to successfully complete the Three-Year Plan and transition to the great Six-Year Plan for building the foundations of socialism. We have the confidence of victory and will move from victory to victory. Victory is clear to us because we can use the infinite experience of Soviet socialist construction, and because the beacon of Lenin-Stalinism illuminates our path.

　　The tremendous transformation of people's lives in the past seven years has not been easily achieved for us. This requires constant overcoming of the resistance of the remnants of the landlords and bourgeoisie, supported by American war instigators. This requires overcoming the right-leaning nationalist tendencies that once emerged within our party, which reflected the attacks of hostile classes. This requires workers, peasants, and intellectuals to engage in selfless and arduous labor full of labor enthusiasm for the happiness of People's Poland. The alliance of workers and peasants led by the working class, consolidated in the flames of this struggle and labor, is the foundation of the power of the people's regime and the foundation for Poland's advance towards socialism.

　　In the flames of this struggle, the prestige of the advanced ranks of the Polish people, the organizer of the Polish people's victory—the Polish United Workers' Party—has grown. The United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party, which are active among the urban petty bourgeoisie and handicraftsmen, fully recognize the authority of the Polish United Workers' Party.

　　Now, under the call of Bolesław Bierut, the first president of People's Poland and chairman of the Polish United Workers' Party, all the lively and creative forces of the Polish people are united under the slogan of the National Front to fight for peace and the completion of the Six-Year Plan.

　　In the seven years of People's Poland's existence, the broadest working masses of our country are convinced that the unbreakable alliance with the Soviet Union and the countries that have freed themselves from imperialist oppression, the alliance that is a manifestation of this new type of international relations, the alliance based on friendship and brotherly cooperation between the peoples of all countries, is a condition for the development, progress, and consolidation of People's Poland, and a condition for guaranteeing its independence and security from the threat of aggression by imperialist forces.

　　In recent years, Polish laborers have listened with greater excitement to the news of the heroic struggles and brilliant victories of the great Chinese people, news that has filled them with courage and confidence in victory. The common effort to embark on the road of liberation, the common struggle for peace and progress, has brought our two peoples closer than in the past several hundred years. Millions of working people in our country are watching every piece of news about the great new labor engaged in by the liberated Chinese people with sincere emotion and warm sympathy. That is to say, whether it is the great land reform implemented by China in the countryside, or the peaceful liberation of Tibet, or the noble assistance given by the Chinese People's Volunteers to the heroic Korean people—the hearts of Polish workers and peasants are connected with the great Chinese people and their heroic Communist Party and Chinese people's leader Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　Although American imperialism and its accomplices have not spent a single day without committing acts of hatred against the new world from the Elbe River to the Yellow Sea, the Polish people know that the ideals of this world will ultimately prevail. The increasingly strengthened ties and friendship between countries liberated from imperialist oppression are the guarantee of this victory.

　　Therefore, the Polish working people are paying attention to the more consolidated political, economic, and cultural relations between People's Poland and the People's Republic of China with a happy and sincere mood.

　　On their National Day—July 22—Polish laborers are watching the friends and comrades in the East and West who are fighting against imperialism for the victory of the new world, and watching the powerful alliance of free people who are fighting for peace, an alliance headed by the victorious socialist country and the great Stalin.

　　On their National Day, the Polish United Workers' Party and Polish laborers warmly salute the 475 million Chinese people, the heroic Communist Party of China, and its great leader Mao Zedong.

　　波兰历史性转变的日子
    波兰统一工人党书记波兰议会副主席　萨姆布劳斯基
    自从人民波兰在反对希特勒法西斯主义的血腥的破坏性的战争火焰中诞生以来，到七月二十二日已经是七周年了。人民波兰是由于苏联战胜希特勒法西斯主义、由于波兰人民大众进行了争取民族解放和社会解放的胜利斗争而产生的。这是波兰人民历史上的第一个胜利的革命，它使屡受占领者沉重压迫的波兰人民打破了希特勒的深重奴役，并且第一次完全实现了波兰国家和人民的主权。它推翻了波兰地主和资产阶级的政权，这些阶级压迫和剥削劳动群众，同时为外国帝国主义服务。它建立了城乡劳动者政权，从而保证了波兰人民的繁荣及其全部创造力的自由发展。
    我们在七年中以巨大的努力恢复了遭受战争破坏的国民经济，完成了波兰历史上没有过的跃进。
    在两次大战间的二十年中，我们曾经是一个被内部矛盾撕裂的弱国，曾经是以白色恐怖对待工人阶级和农民的国家，曾经是以民族压迫对待几百万乌克兰人和白俄罗斯人的国家，它和所有邻国几乎总是不和。在两次大战间的二十年中，我们曾是帝国主义国家棋盘上的一颗“卒”子，统治者把我国交给外国资本家摆布，而在这时期中我们独立的唯一表现是这样的事实，即波兰统治者虽然换过自己的主人，但总是留在领导欧洲反苏十字军的帝国主义国家的势力范围内。
    如今外国资本家对波兰的掠夺已经永远地结束了，如今我们的自由和独立建立在国家主权和经济主权不可侵犯的基础上，如今我们民族本身是被压迫者但又压迫其他民族的时代一去不复返了，如今我们人民属于伟大的民主和社会主义阵营，并且在自己历史中第一次四周都是友好与善意的邻国。
    我们曾经是农业国，工业很不发达。受失业逼迫的波兰工人曾不得不跑到西欧和美洲各国去谋生。现在我们正以日益加快的速度转变为工业国。一九三一年全国人口统计表明，百分之六十一的波兰居民都从事农业，仅百分之三十九的波兰居民从事其他职业。一九五零年全国人口统计表明，百分之四十六居民从事农业，而百分之五十四的居民从事其他行业。在七年中，我们恢复、改造和重建了几千座工业企业，为几百万人建筑了房屋，复兴了华沙，耕种了以前没有使用的广大土地，调整了西部地区的农业和工业，为几百万儿童和青年建筑了学校，提高了千百万群众的生活和文化水平。
    在七年中，我们创立了强大的工业，一九五一年工业产量按人口计算，几乎增为战前的四倍。
    “九月”（编者按：波兰在一九四四年九月六日公布土地改革法。）前波兰是落后的、乡村人口过剩的、遭受显著缺乏耕地的痛苦的国家。因此人民政权的第一项措施，就是实施伟大的土地改革。由于土地改革，消灭了地主阶级，波兰农民得到了六百万公顷以上的土地。使几百万农民受到痛苦的耕地荒已成往事。现在每年都有几十万农民和乡村青年参加工业工作、进学校和参加大建筑工程。七年中农业产品已增加一倍。每公顷的产量增加百分之十五到二十。羊和猪的头数在五年中增加了两倍。在波兰的田野上，约有二万八千拖拉机在工作。四分之一以上的农民经济，即一万三千多个村庄使用着电力。在“九月”前的二十年间，波兰使用电力的农村，只有这个数目的十分之一。农业产量总值按农业人口计算，已超过战前水平一倍。
    我们的国家正经历着深刻的文化革命。初等和中等学校的数目在增加着。战前只有五百个职业学校，现在则有四千三百个。战前只有二十九所高等学校，现在我们有了七十九所。报纸杂志和书籍的份数在增长着。劳动者打破了有产阶级对科学和文化的独占，正依靠现代科学的成就来建设社会主义。
    同伟大苏联的友好和同盟，以及苏联从人民波兰诞生时起就给予我们的兄弟援助，是我们一切胜利和成就的根源。苏联给我们带来了民族解放和社会解放，并且防止了帝国主义国家对我国的侵略。由于苏联的援助，我们收回了原来奥得河和尼斯河上的波兰土地。解放后最初几年我们感觉到粮食缺乏，苏联的帮助使我们免于饥荒。当我们走上工业化道路的时候，苏联供给的工业器材，使我们有可能顺利地完成三年计划和转入实现建设社会主义基础的伟大的六年计划。我们有胜利的信心，并且将从胜利走向胜利。胜利对于我们是明确的，因为我们能够使用苏联社会主义建设的无穷的经验，因为列宁斯大林学说的明灯照亮着我们的道路。
    七年来人民生活的巨大转变对于我们不是轻易达到的。这须要经常克服受美国战争挑拨者支持的地主和资产阶级残余的反抗。这须要克服我们党内曾经产生的右倾民族主义倾向，这种倾向反映了敌对阶级的攻击。这须要工人、农民和知识分子为了人民波兰的幸福，进行充满劳动热情的忘我的艰苦劳动。在这个斗争和劳动的火焰中巩固了的由工人阶级领导的工农联盟，就是人民政权力量的基础，是波兰向社会主义道路前进的基础。
    在这个斗争的火焰中，波兰人民的先进队伍、波兰人民胜利的组织者——波兰统一工人党的威信增长了。统一农民党，在城市小资产阶级和手工业者中活动的民主党，都完全承认了波兰统一工人党的权威。
    现在，在人民波兰的第一任总统、波兰统一工人党主席贝鲁特的号召下，波兰人民的一切生动的和创造性的力量，都在全国战线所提出来的为和平与完成六年计划而斗争的口号下团结起来了。
    在人民波兰存在的七年中，我国最广大的劳动群众确信：与苏联和摆脱了帝国主义压迫的国家的牢不可破的联盟，这种新型的国际关系的表现的联盟，这种基于各国人民间友好与兄弟般合作的联盟，是人民波兰力量的发展、进步与巩固的条件，是保证它的独立，保证它免受帝国主义势力侵略威胁的安全的条件。
    这几年来，波兰劳动者更兴奋地听到了伟大的中国人民的英勇斗争和辉煌胜利的消息，这些消息使他们充满了勇气和胜利的信心。走向解放道路的共同努力，为和平和进步的共同斗争，已经使我们两国人民比过去几百年还要接近了。我国千百万劳动群众以真诚的感动与热烈的同情，注视着解放了的中国人民从事伟大的新的劳动的每一个消息。这就是说，不论中国在农村中实行的伟大土地改革，或是和平解放西藏，或是中国人民志愿军对英勇的朝鲜人民予以高贵的援助时——波兰工人和农民的心都是和伟大的中国人民及其英勇的共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东同志连在一起的。
    虽然美帝国主义及其帮凶们没有一天不对从易北河到黄海的新世界作出仇恨的行为，但波兰人民知道，正是这个世界的理想将获得最后的胜利。从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的各国之间的日益加强的联系和友谊，就是这个胜利的保证。
    因此，波兰劳动人民以愉快诚恳的心情，注意着人民波兰和中华人民共和国之间的更加巩固的政治、经济和文化关系。
    在自己的国庆日——七月二十二日，波兰劳动者注视着为争取新世界胜利而与帝国主义作斗争的东方与西方的朋友与同志，注视着为和平而斗争的自由人民的强大同盟，这种同盟是以胜利的社会主义国家和伟大斯大林为首的。
    在自己的国庆日，波兰统一工人党和波兰劳动者热烈地向四亿七千五百万中国人民致敬，向英勇的中国共产党和它的伟大领袖毛泽东致敬。
