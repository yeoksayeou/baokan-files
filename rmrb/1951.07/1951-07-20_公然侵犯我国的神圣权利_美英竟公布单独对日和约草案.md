　　Blatant Infringement of China's Sacred Rights
　  US and UK Actually Announce Separate Draft Peace Treaty with Japan
    Completely betraying international agreements, infringing upon the rights and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that fought against Japan, turning Japan into a US military base for aggression in the Far East.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] Following the US government's unilateral decision to convene a so-called "Peace Conference with Japan" in San Francisco in early September and illegally sign a separate peace treaty with Japan, Washington and London simultaneously announced on the 12th a so-called "revised" US-unilaterally-drafted "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan." Although this so-called "revised draft" has changed in form from the original eight chapters and twenty-two articles to seven chapters and twenty-seven articles compared to the US draft published in early April, the two are basically the same in terms of content, nature, and even the wording of the articles. It still completely betrays international agreements on the Japanese issue, infringes upon the sovereignty and interests of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that fought against Japan, and seeks to turn Japan into a US military base and colony for aggression in the Far East.
    The "revised draft," regarding the procedure for the US to handle the peace treaty with Japan, is the same as the original US draft, that is, it not only excludes China and the Soviet Union but also treats them as enemy countries. The only difference is that this draft more blatantly excludes the sacred right of the People's Republic of China, which has resisted the longest and sacrificed the most, in drafting and signing the peace treaty with Japan. Article 23(a) of the draft deliberately omits China from the list of countries entitled to sign and ratify the peace treaty with Japan. The US and UK, in their London talks, have arbitrarily decided that defeated and unconditionally surrendered Japan should "choose" whether to reconcile with the People's Republic of China or with the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits. The US and UK are scheming to exclude the People's Republic of China by this absurd method. The draft also unilaterally stipulates that three years after the separate treaty comes into effect, Japan will "terminate" the "obligation" to reconcile with countries that refuse to sign the separate treaty.
    On the territorial issue, as with the original US draft, the United States still insists on invading China's sacred sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Article 2(b) of the draft states: "Japan hereby renounces all rights, title, and claim to Taiwan and the Pescadores." However, the draft deliberately avoids mentioning the Cairo Declaration's stipulation that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands be returned to China. This once again exposes the United States' ambition to occupy Chinese territory. At the same time, the United States, under the guise of so-called trusteeship, seized the Ryukyu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and other islands south of 29 degrees north latitude, and in the draft, it still arbitrarily stipulates that the United States is the "trustee authority" for these islands.
    The so-called "security" clauses drafted to facilitate arming Japan are also the same as before. The draft, on the one hand, does not mention any restrictions on Japan's armed forces, while at the same time, under the guise of "striving to assist" so-called United Nations actions, it opens the door for the United States to use Japan for aggression. The draft also openly stipulates that the United States will occupy Japan for a long time based on the "US-Japan Military Agreement." Article 6(a) of Chapter 3 ("Security") first hypocritically states: "All occupation forces of the Allied Powers shall withdraw from Japan as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Treaty, in any event not later than ninety days." But it goes on to say: "However, this provision shall not preclude foreign forces from being stationed or remaining in Japanese territory under or as a result of any bilateral or multilateral agreement already concluded or which may be concluded by one or more of the Allied Powers and Japan." Article 6(b) further stipulates that Japanese property currently used and occupied by the US occupation forces will continue to be owned by the US military after the separate treaty is signed, making Japan continue to serve as a US base for aggression.
    The draft stipulates harsh conditions for economically enslaving Japan. The draft still stipulates that Japan grant the United States "most-favored-nation treatment" and "national treatment," and extends the period from the original three years to four years. Regarding the issue of reparations, the draft basically cancels the legitimate right of other countries to demand reasonable compensation for losses from Japan.
    In addition, on the issue of war criminals, the draft also arbitrarily grants the United States and Japan the illegal power to release Japanese war criminals.

　　公然侵犯我国的神圣权利
　  美英竟公布单独对日和约草案
    完全背弃国际协议，侵犯中苏及其他对日作战国家的权益，变日本为美国侵略远东的军事基地。      
    【新华社十九日讯】继美国政府片面决定于九月初在旧金山召开所谓“对日和会”、非法签订单独对日和约后，华盛顿与伦敦于十二日又同时公布了所谓经过“修正”的美国片面制订的“对日和约草案”。这一所谓“修正草案”，和四月初发表的美国草案比较，在形式方面虽由原来的八章二十二条改为七章二十七条，但两者在内容与性质方面，甚至条文的字句上，基本上是一般无二的。它依然完全背弃有关日本问题的国际协议，侵犯中国、苏联和其他对日作战国家的主权与利益，要使日本变为美国侵略远东的军事基地与殖民地。
    “修正草案”中关于由美国包办对日和约的程序，和原来的美国草案一样，即不仅排斥中苏两国，而且把它们作为敌国看待。所不同的，是这个草案更公然排斥抗战最久、牺牲最大的中华人民共和国在拟制与签署对日和约问题上的神圣权利。草案第二十三条甲款故意在有权签署与批准对日和约的国家的名单中，不列入中国。美英在伦敦会谈中，已擅自决定：由战败的无条件投降的日本，来“选择”与中华人民共和国还是与国民党残余匪帮媾和。美英阴谋以这个荒谬绝伦的办法，来排除中华人民共和国。草案并片面地规定，单独和约生效三年后，日本即“终止”和拒绝签署单独和约的国家媾和的“义务”。
    在领土问题上，和原来的美国草案一样，美国仍坚持侵略中国的台湾、澎湖列岛的神圣主权。草案第二条乙款说：“日本兹放弃其对于台湾及澎湖群岛之一切权利，权利名义与要求。”但是，草案对于开罗宣言规定的把台湾和澎湖群岛归还中国一节，仍故意避而不谈。这再次暴露了美国霸占中国领土的野心。同时，美国以所谓托管名义侵夺了北纬二十九度以南的琉球群岛、小笠原群岛等岛屿，在草案中仍擅自规定美国为这些岛屿的“托管当局”。
    为了便利武装日本而拟制的所谓“安全”条款，也是和从前一样。草案一方面对于限制日本的武装力量只字不提，同时却在“尽力协助”所谓联合国行动的掩饰下，为美国利用日本进行侵略，敞开大门。草案并公然规定美国将根据“美日军事协定”长期占领日本。草案第三章（“安全”）第六条甲款首先伪善地说：“盟国的一切占领军在本约生效后尽速撤离日本，无论如何不迟过九十天。”但它接着就说：“但是，这项规定并不妨碍外国军队根据或由于一个或一个以上的盟国与日本所已经缔结的或可能缔结的任何双边的或多边的协定，而驻扎或留驻在日本领土上。”同条乙款又规定，现供美国占领军使用与占有的日本财产，在单独和约签订后继续为美军所有，使日本继续充当美国的侵略基地。
    草案规定了在经济上奴役日本的苛刻条件，草案仍然规定日本给予美国以“最惠国待遇”和“国民待遇”，并将期限从原先的三年延长为四年。关于赔偿问题，草案基本上取消了其他国家要求日本合理地赔偿损失的正当权利。
    此外，在战犯问题上，草案也擅自赋予美国与日本以释放日本战犯的非法权力。
