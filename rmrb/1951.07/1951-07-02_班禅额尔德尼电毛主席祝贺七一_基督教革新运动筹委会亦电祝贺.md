　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th -- Panchen Erdeni telegraphed Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 28th, congratulating them on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram stated: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Tibetan people have broken away from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the big family of the people's motherland to enjoy a new life of national equality, freedom, and happiness. As we drink water, we remember its source. We deeply know that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without New China, it would be impossible for the Tibetan people to return to the embrace of the motherland. This is something we will never forget. Panchen vows to lead the Tibetan people with the utmost sincerity, under the leadership of the Communist Party, to strive together with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country to consolidate the great victory construction of the motherland and build a new Tibet.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th -- The Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of the Chinese Christian Church telegraphed Chairman Mao on the eve of "July 1st," congratulating him on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram stated: Respected Chairman Mao: Under your wise leadership, the Chinese people, after a long and arduous revolutionary struggle, have not only liberated the entire mainland, but have also created a solid foundation for the construction of New China; at the same time, Chinese Christianity has also been rescued from the clutches of imperialism. We are determined, under the leadership and encouragement of your victorious banner, to resolutely eliminate all imperialist influences within Christianity and build a Chinese Christian church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating.

　　The committee also issued a circular, calling on Christians across the country to universally celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on "July 1st"; Christian churches and organizations in various places should arrange studies so that every Christian understands the great contribution of the Chinese Communist Party to the Chinese people.
