　　The Work of Checking Fields and Determining Production in the Past Six Months
    Li Canzhang
    In the past six months, the agricultural tax field verification and production determination work has been carried out in conjunction with patriotic education and the land reform and issuance of land certificates in the new districts, and has achieved considerable results. The new method of "investigation and production determination" has been promoted, valuable experience has been created, a foundation has been laid for future field verification and production determination work, favorable conditions have been created for further fairness and rationality of agricultural tax, and farmers' production enthusiasm has been greatly encouraged. The field verification and production determination work in the first half of this year has three main characteristics:
            Strengthened the planning of the work; determined the goals of the work
    The first is to strengthen the planning of the work. Many provinces have proposed deadlines for checking fields and fixing yields, giving this work clear goals to strive for. Since the beginning of spring, eighteen provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Chahar, Pingyuan, Shandong, Henan, Suiyuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Songjiang, Jilin, Rehe, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, Fujian, and Tianjin, have formulated plans for checking fields and determining production. Shandong plans to strive to fix yields in most parts of the province within this year. Other provinces have determined to complete the clearing of fields and fixing of yields within two years. In areas where land reform has been completed in the new districts, it is generally required to clear fields and fix yields within two to three years. In order to achieve the above plans, many regions have trained a large number of cadres. Shandong Province alone has trained more than 3,000 cadres (including more than 1,000 assistants and some township cadres). Pingyuan Province trained 414 people.
   Taking the clearing of fields and the accurate determination of yields as a concrete manifestation of patriotism and a method of promoting production
    Most regions have taken the field verification and production determination work as a concrete manifestation of resisting America and aiding Korea and patriotism, and as a method of encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for production. Emphasis is placed on close cooperation with various related tasks, so that the work has made relatively smooth progress. The Shandong Provincial People's Government has listed the field verification and production determination work as one of the important tasks in the province's agricultural production this year, and plans to appropriately elevate it to the central task during the slack farming season. Due to the leadership's attention, the work has progressed rapidly. The five special districts of Dezhou, Huimin, Jiaozhou, Laiyang, and Wendeng will all complete the conversion of mu and determination of production pilot projects before the wheat harvest. Pingyuan Province, in conjunction with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, drought resistance and cotton planting, and resistance to America and aid to Korea, has completed the production determination work in three entire counties (15 districts) and 17 districts, and has universally measured the land in 19 counties. It plans to pass it through people's representatives' meetings at all levels before the autumn harvest and fully carry out the production determination work after the autumn harvest. Henan seized the gap before spring plowing and checked out 4.51 million mu of farmland. Shanxi Province cleared 30 percent of the land in 60 counties and reviewed and adjusted yields in 24 percent of the area. Currently, four counties, including Licheng, Pingshun, Huguan, and Yushe, have reported for fixation. Before spring plowing, Chahar Province adjusted the yield in more than 30 districts, accounting for 24 percent of the area planned for fixation throughout the year. Other provinces, such as Guangdong, plan to organize a long-term work team of 1,900 people to carry out land reform and sort out land registration, striving to complete the field verification and production determination work in 50 percent of the area within this year. Hunan Province requires the completion of field verification and production determination in 30 counties from April to the autumn harvest. In the East China region, Su Nan summarized the pilot experience of Wuxi, preparing to promote this experience and vigorously carry out production determination work. Since the beginning of spring, the provinces in the Northeast region, in conjunction with resisting America and aiding Korea, have conducted cadre training and key experiments, preparing to vigorously carry out the work in July and August.
            Adopted the new method of "investigation and production determination"
    The second characteristic of the field verification and production determination work is that many regions have successively adopted the new method of "government investigation and production determination, combined with democratic appraisal," criticizing the old method of "self-reporting and public discussion" or "democratic appraisal" based on townships. All regions reflect that the advantages of the new method are: "generally reasonable, simple and easy to implement." For example, this year, Yanshi County in Henan Province completed the production determination work in the entire county in more than a month during spring plowing production, shock cotton planting, and issuance of land certificates. The number of mu increased by 13 percent. The yield increased by 9.4 percent. The masses said: "This time the determination is fair; if we were to evaluate it like in the past, we wouldn't be able to evaluate it well even in two years." According to the county's experience, if sufficient preparations are made in advance, it can be completed in half a month to twenty days. Other counties, such as Qinyang, Boai, and Wenxian in Pingyuan Province, and Lincheng and Xinhe counties in Hebei Province, have also tried the new method of investigation and production determination and achieved success. Different specific methods are adopted in different regions, and various valuable experiences have been created.
            New districts combine land reform and the issuance of land certificates to clear fields
    The third characteristic is that in the new districts where land reform has been completed, field verification work is closely combined with the issuance of land certificates. Shandong and Fujian provinces established a unified organization for the issuance of land certificates and the sorting out of land registration before issuing land certificates. Shandong Province also appointed administrative heads as the director and deputy director, and other relevant departments sent capable cadres to participate, establishing organizations at all levels to lead and promote this work. The method of combination is to first put forward the slogan of "find more of the landlord's hidden land and distribute more land" before land distribution, and deeply mobilize the masses to find out the landlord's hidden land. Before issuing land certificates, the main task is to clear the peasants' land. The slogan of "no supplementary payment of burdens or punishment for self-reporting hidden land; no guarantee of land rights for concealing land" was put forward to launch a comprehensive investigation. There are several ways to check the fields: The first is to mobilize the masses to measure each other in groups of residents; the second is to draw a sample and then convert it uniformly; the third is to conduct a general survey under the leadership of the government. Local experience proves that although the first method can also find hidden land, it often leads to omissions or repetitions due to lack of leadership; or many errors occur because the sizes of the bows and rulers made by the masses themselves are different. For example, after the typical townships in Xinyang and Nanyang special districts of Henan carried out self-measurement and mutual measurement, more than 5 percent of hidden land was found upon inspection. The second method is often effective in areas where there is collective concealment and discounting; however, in many areas, the old mu bows and rulers are of different sizes, and the uniform conversion after sampling still cannot completely clear the land. The third method of general survey is a more thorough method, but it must be carried out conditionally and with preparation. The general practice is to first uniformly issue bows and rulers by the county, and then provide short-term training for surveyors. Villages mobilize the masses to insert signs and supervise the measurement, and the township government divides the entire village's land into responsible areas and groups in charge. For example, Yanshi County, Henan Province, completed the entire process in more than ten days of comprehensive surveying.
            Consolidate existing achievements and strive for balanced development of work
    Although the work in this stage has the above achievements, the development of work in various regions is very uneven. Some leading cadres in some regions have not paid due attention to this work; some regions still use the old method of "self-reporting and public discussion" or "democratic appraisal" based on townships; some new land reform areas are eager to issue land certificates without seriously clearing the fields, etc. These are the things that need to be corrected in the future.

　　半年来的查田定产工作
    李灿章
    半年来，农业税查田定产工作与爱国主义教育和新区土地改革、颁发土地证等工作结合进行，获得了相当的成绩。推广了“调查定产”的新方法，创造了宝贵的经验，为今后的查田定产工作打下了基础，给农业税进一步的公平合理造成了有利条件，并相当地鼓励了农民的生产情绪。今年上半年的查田定产工作，有三个主要特点：
            加强了工作的计划性；确定了工作的目标
    第一是加强了工作的计划性。许多省份提出了查清田亩，固定产量的期限，使这一工作有了明确的奋斗目标。入春以来，已有山西、察哈尔、平原、山东、河南、绥远、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、松江、吉林、热河、辽东、辽西、黑龙江、福建、天津等十八个省市，拟订了查田定产工作计划。山东计划在今年以内，争取全省大部地区固定产量。其他各省均确定在二年内全部做到查清田亩，固定产量。在新区已完成土地改革的地区，一般要求二、三年内查清田亩，并固定产量。为实现上述计划，不少地区大批集训了干部。仅山东省训练的干部（包括千余助手与部分乡干部在内）就有三千多人。平原省训练了四一四人。
   把清查田亩，订实产量，作为爱国主义的具体内容和推动生产的
        方法之一
    大部地区把查田定产工作，作为抗美援朝和爱国主义的具体内容，并作为鼓励农民生产积极性的方法之一。强调与各有关工作密切配合，因而使工作得到比较顺利的进展。山东省人民政府把查田定产工作列为该省今年农业生产中的重要工作之一，并计划在农闲时，酌情提升为中心工作。由于领导重视，工作进展颇快。德州、惠民、胶州、莱阳、文登等五个专区，麦征前将全部完成折合地亩及定产试点工作。平原省结合镇压反革命、抗旱植棉及抗美援朝等工作，已完成三个整县（十五个区）又十七个区的定产工作，并普丈了十九个县的土地，计划秋征前通过各级人民代表会，逐级评定；秋后全面展开定产工作。河南抓紧春耕前的空隙，查出田地四百五十一万亩。山西省清丈了六十个县内百分之三十的土地，并有百分之二十四的地区审查、调整了产量。现已有黎城、平顺、壶关、榆社等四县报请固定。察哈尔省春耕前调整了三十多个区的产量，占全年计划固定地区百分之二十四。其他各省如广东计划组织一千九百人的长期工作队，进行土地改革和整理地籍工作，争取今年内完成百分之五十地区的查田定产工作。湖南省自四月份开始，到秋征前要求完成三十个县的查田定产。华东区的苏南总结了无锡的试点经验，准备推广这一经验，大力开展定产工作。东北区各省入春以来，结合抗美援朝，进行集训干部，重点试验，准备七、八月份大力开展。
            采用了“调查定产”的新方法
    查田定产工作的第二个特点，是许多地区先后采用了“政府调查定产，结合民主评议”的新方法，批判了以乡为单位“自报公议”、“民主评议”的旧办法。各地反映，新办法的优点是：“大体合理，简便易行”。如今年河南省偃师县在春耕生产、突击种棉，颁发土地证等工作中，经月余时间，即完成了全县定产的工作。田亩数增加百分之十三。产量提高百分之九点四。群众说：“这回订得公道；像过去那样评，再评二年也评不好。”根据该县经验，如事前准备充分，半月至二十天就能完成。他如平原省的沁阳、博爱、温县，河北省的临城、新河县，也试用了调查定产的新方法，获得成功。在不同地区采取不同的具体方法，各地创造了许多宝贵经验。
            新区结合土地改革和发土地证工作清查田亩
    第三个特点是在完成土地改革的新区，把查田工作与颁发土地证密切结合。山东、福建两省，在发土地证之前，建立了颁发土地证与整理地籍的统一组织。山东省并以行政首长为正副主任，其他有关部门派得力干部参加，逐级建立组织，领导与推动这一工作。其结合办法是土地分配前，首先提出“多查地主黑地、多分田”的口号，深入发动群众，查清地主的黑地。发土地证前，主要是查清农民的土地。提出“自报黑田不补缴负担，不处罚；隐瞒土地，地权没保障”的口号，展开全面清查。查田的方法有以下几种：第一种是以居民小组为单位，发动群众自丈互丈；第二种是先抽丈再统一折算；第三种是政府领导普遍清丈。各地经验证明：第一种方法，虽然也可查出黑地，但多由于缺乏领导，发生漏丈或重复现象；或因群众自制弓尺大小不一，发生很多错误。如河南的信阳、南阳专区的典型乡自丈互丈以后，经检查又发现百分之五以上的黑地。第二种方法在集体隐瞒打折扣的地区，往往行之有效；但好多地区旧亩弓尺大小不一，抽丈后统一折算仍不能彻底查清。第三种普丈的方法是比较彻底的方法，但必须有条件有准备地进行。一般的作法是首先由县统一制发弓尺，并将丈量人员施行短期训练，乡村发动群众插标监丈，由乡政府将全村土地划分责任区，分组负责。如河南偃师县全面普丈十多天，全部完成。
            巩固已有成绩争取工作的平衡发展
    这一阶段的工作虽有以上成绩，但各地工作的发展是很不平衡的。有些地区的领导干部对这一工作还没有加以应有的重视；有的地区还沿用老一套的以乡为单位的“自报公议”或“民主评议”的方法；有些新土地改革地区急于颁发土地证，而没有认真清查田亩等等。这是今后需要注意纠正的。
