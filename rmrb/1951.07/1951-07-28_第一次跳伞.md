　　My First Parachute Jump
　　Lin Li
    I was originally a poor child. Under the cultivation and education of the great, wise Chairman Mao and the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, I became a female soldier of the People's Air Force, a glorious female parachutist of New China.

    After I joined the aviation school, through continuous education from the superiors and the Party, my political awareness improved, and I gradually mastered the skills of parachuting. Later, I became the leader of the business group, working and studying at the same time. I once requested to participate in parachuting, but the superiors, because my health was not good enough and my skills were not proficient enough, did not allow me. They told me to concentrate on studying and working, and to master the skills first. So, with the determination to master the skills and learn to parachute, I studied hard and worked actively. During this period, I made meritorious contributions and gloriously joined the great Chinese Communist Party.

    This April, I again asked my superiors to allow me to parachute. At that time, I was very afraid that the superiors would not let me participate as they had done before. However, the superiors not only allowed it but also supported my request, telling me to be calm, step up practice, and pay attention to my health. The instructor comrades also did their best to support me and help me study.

    Finally, with a healthy body and skilled techniques, I turned my wish to parachute into a reality. At that time, I was so happy that I could not sit or sleep peacefully. I reviewed every movement in parachuting again and again. On the night before the parachute jump, I was very excited. Lying in bed, I thought about many things, about the physiological weaknesses of women, but also about Guo Junqing and Tian Guiying. I firmly believe that physiological weaknesses are not insurmountable difficulties. At this time, I thought about the qualities of a Communist Party member. I should tell the Party my determination to be a glorious parachutist. I got out of bed and wrote a letter to the Party, expressing my determination.

    After the news that I was going to parachute spread, the comrades were very concerned. The leaders were especially concerned, which made me very moved. The day of the parachute jump was precisely my menstrual period, but I didn't say it, fearing that the superiors would not let me parachute on that day because of it. On this day, the instructor comrades were even more nervous than everyone else, repeatedly checking the parachutes and telling me to rest well and practice the movements more. At that time, I was anxiously hoping to be allowed to parachute immediately. Because after all, this was the first time, and I was not very calm in my heart. However, I received support and encouragement from the caring eyes of the instructors and comrades. After getting on the plane, my mood gradually stabilized, and I concentrated all my attention on parachuting.

    The plane was rising little by little. I stood at the door of the cabin, facing the wind, looking at the beautiful land of our motherland, looking at the toy-like little houses. After hearing the parachute jump signal, I jumped from the high altitude! The wind from the propeller blew my body crooked, and this had to be corrected. In a short second, I opened the parachute in an orderly manner. I calmly checked the parachute. The round umbrella was illuminated by the sunlight into a pink color, which was very beautiful.

    Gradually, I was getting closer and closer to the ground. At this time, I saw that there were sorghum stalks under my feet, and I couldn't land here. So I manipulated the parachute and landed towards a large depression. I landed safely. The leaders and comrades all came to congratulate me and comfort me.

    However, I am only at the beginning. I cannot be complacent, cannot be arrogant! I must continue to work hard to improve my political and cultural level and professional knowledge, and prepare to strive for and create greater achievements, to contribute all my efforts to building a strong People's Air Force, to our great and glorious motherland, and to our most beloved, greatest, and wisest leader, Mao Zedong!

　　第一次跳伞
　　林莉
    我本来是个穷孩子，在伟大英明的毛主席和伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的培养教育下，我成了人民空军的一个女战士，成了新中国的光荣的女跳伞员。
    我参加航校以后，经过上级和党的不断教育，政治上有了觉悟，并且逐渐掌握了关于跳伞的业务。后来我担任了业务组组长，一边工作，一边学习。我曾经要求参加跳伞，可是上级因为我身体还不够好，业务还不够精通，没有允许我，叫我安心学习，安心工作，学好业务再说。于是我抱着一定要学好业务，一定要学会跳伞的决心努力学习，积极工作。这时期我立了功，也光荣地加入了伟大的中国共产党。
    今年四月，我又要求上级允许我跳伞。那时，我很怕上级会像上次一样不让我参加。但是，上级不但允许了，而且支持我的要求，要我沉着，加紧练习，注意身体健康。教员同志们也尽力支持着我，帮助我学习。
    终于，我以健康的身体、熟练的技术使跳伞的愿望变成事实。那时，我高兴得坐卧不宁。我一次又一次地复习着跳伞中的每一个动作。在跳伞的前一天晚上，我心里非常兴奋。我睡在床上，想到了许多事情，想到女同志生理上的弱点，可是也想到了郭俊卿、田桂英，我坚决不承认生理上的弱点就是克服不了的困难。这个时候，我又想到了共产党员的品质。我应当把我的要作个光荣的跳伞员的决心告诉党。我从床上爬起来，写了一封信给党，表示了我的决心。
    在我要跳伞的消息传出去以后，同志们都十分关心。首长们尤其关心，这使我非常感动。跳伞那天正是我的月经期，可是我没有说出来，怕上级因此不让我在这一天跳伞。在这一天，教员同志的心情比大家更紧张，一再检查降落伞，关照我好好休息，多练习动作。当时我着急地盼望马上能够让我跳伞。因为这到底是头一次，我的心里还不十分镇静。但是，我从教员和同志们关怀的眼光里得到了支持和鼓励，上了飞机以后，我的心情也就渐渐地安定了，我就全神贯注到跳伞上。
    飞机一点点上升着。我站在机舱门口，迎着风，看着我们祖国美丽的大地，看着玩具似的小房子。听到跳伞信号响了以后，我从高空跳了下来！螺旋桨的风吹歪了我的身体，这必须纠正。在短短的一秒钟之间，我有秩序地打开了降落伞。我镇静地检查了降落伞。圆圆的伞被太阳光照成粉红色，非常好看。
    渐渐地离地面愈来愈近了。这时，我看见脚下是高粱楂子，这里是不能落下去的。于是我操纵着伞，向一个大的凹坑降落下去。我安全着陆了。首长和同志们都赶来庆贺我、慰问我。
    但是，我还仅仅是在开始。我不能自满，不能骄傲！我要继续努力，提高自己政治、文化水平和业务知识，准备争取和创造更大的成绩，为建设一支强大的人民空军，为我们伟大光荣的祖国，为我们最敬爱、最伟大、最英明的领袖毛泽东，贡献我的一切！
