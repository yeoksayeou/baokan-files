　　It's Never Wrong to Entrust Children to Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army

    After my child, Feng Zhongwen, went to the military cadre school, I initially had an incorrect idea, always thinking he must be living a very hard life. Although he said in every letter that he was living very well, I still didn't believe it. (Note: Feng Zhongwen was originally a student at Shanghai Bile Middle School, who participated in the military cadre school last time, and is now at the naval school.)
    Earlier this year, as a mother of a military cadre school student, I participated in the East China and Shanghai Military Cadre School慰问团 (Comfort Mission). I went to the logistics, communications, naval school, and artillery school, etc. There, the first thing I saw were students in People's Liberation Army uniforms, full of energy, and all of them were healthy. When shaking hands with me, I found their hands were thick and strong. The children living in the revolutionary big family had all grown strong.
    During a discussion meeting with them, one student eagerly said: "Our life here is really good, just like at home. Although we have mothers to take care of us at home, the leaders and veteran comrades here take care of us like mothers. I remember when we first arrived, everyone felt a bit cold, but in the middle of the night, the veteran comrades lit charcoal braziers for us." Another student said: "When I joined the military cadre school, I didn't have any ideological problems, but I was afraid of getting sick in the army. I thought, there probably wouldn't be good doctors or medicines in the army, and if I got sick, I couldn't go home, wouldn't that be terrible? So I hoped every day that I wouldn't get sick. Once, I suddenly fell ill. I thought, this is terrible, but unexpectedly, not only did more people take care of me than at home, but people also came to take care of me constantly at night. Veteran comrades even used their saved money to buy biscuits and fruit for me, which made me happy and grateful, and I recovered quickly. Now I must study harder and never fail the education and care of the leaders and veteran comrades." These facts made me realize that the People's Liberation Army is not only as brave as tigers on the battlefield, but also as docile and kind as慈母 (a loving mother) among comrades.
    When I saw my child at the naval school, his first words were: "Mom, this Spring Festival was even better than in previous years at home. The leaders and veteran comrades asked us to rehearse plays and practice dancing very early. On New Year's Eve, we also had a dinner party, and after dinner, we watched plays and danced until dawn. This is truly the happiest Spring Festival I have ever had." He then led me to their dormitory. The first thing that surprised me was that my child's quilt was folded so squarely, and the shoes were lined up in rows, just like the other beds, both neat and clean. This couldn't help but remind me that when my child was at home, he never folded his quilt every morning. If you asked him to fold it, he would say he didn't have time, and even leave without eating breakfast. But now it's completely different, he already knows how to love cleanliness and love labor. He said to me: "Mom, the comrades in the cooking squad are really great, working for us all year round. When we ask him: 'Are you tired?' He says to us: 'It is an honor to serve the country, how can I feel tired?' Mom, I must study hard and learn from the veteran comrades' spirit of loving the motherland and the people, and protect our beloved motherland and our mothers." I was very happy to hear this. It is never wrong to entrust children to Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army. Only in this way can children progress and have a bright future. I felt that my previous worries were really unnecessary.
    This comfort visit has given me a lot of education. I want to tell dear parents that our children are living in a happy and warm revolutionary big family. They understand the reason for defending the country, and they understand even more how to love their parents and the great motherland. Dear parents, be happy that our children have embarked on glorious posts!

### 把孩子交给毛主席和人民解放军是不会错的

　　把孩子交给毛主席和人民解放军是不会错的
    沈瑞丽
    我的孩子冯忠文去军事干部学校以后，起初我有一种不正确的想法，总认为他一定过着很艰苦的生活，虽然他每次来信都说过得非常好，可是我还不相信。（按冯忠文原是上海比乐中学学生，上次参加军事干校的，现在海军学校。）
    今年初，我以参加军事干校学生的母亲的身份，参加了华东及上海军事干部学校慰问团，到了后勤、通讯、海军学校和炮兵学校等处。到那里，首先看到的便是一个个精神饱满穿着解放军制服的学生，他们都身体健壮；在和我握手的时候，我发觉他们的手又厚又有力，生活在革命的大家庭中的孩子们都长得结实了。
    在他们和我们开座谈会时，有一个学生抢着说：“我们在这里的生活真好，像在家中一样。家中虽有妈妈照顾我们，但是这里的首长和老同志都像妈妈一样地照顾着我们。记得初到时大家感到有些冷，可是半夜里老同志便替我们生了火盆。”又有一个学生说：“在参加军事干校时我没有什么思想问题，但就是害怕在部队中生病。我想，在军队中总不会有好医生、好药品，生病又不能回家，不是糟了吗？所以我天天盼望自己不要生病。一次，我忽然病了。我想，这下可糟了，不料在病中非但看我的人比在家里多，而且晚上还不断有人来照顾我，还有老同志把节省下来的钱，买饼干、水果给我吃，使我又高兴又感激，很快病就好了。现在我一定要加紧学习，决不辜负首长与老同志们的教育和照顾。”这些事实都使我认识到人民解放军不但在战场上像猛虎那样勇敢，在同志之间又驯良、和善得像慈母一样。
    当我在海军学校见到我的孩子时，他第一句话就说：“妈，这一次春节比往年在家过得还好，首长与老同志很早就要我们排戏，练舞蹈，除夕晚上，我们还聚餐，饭后便看戏，跳舞，一直玩到天亮。这真是我有生以来第一次过的愉快的春节。”他又把我引到他们的寝室。首先使我惊奇的，便是我孩子的被折得那样方方的，鞋子都是一排一排的，和别的床铺一样，又整齐，又清洁。这不禁使我想到我孩子在家时，每天早上从来不折被，如果你要他叠时，他便推说来不及了，甚至连早饭都不吃就走了。可是现在完全不同了，他已知道了爱清洁，爱劳动。他对我说：“妈，这里的炊事员同志真伟大，一年到头为我们劳动着，我们问他：‘辛苦吗？’他对我们说：‘为国家服务是光荣的，那里会感到辛苦呢？’妈，我一定要努力学习，更要学习老同志们的爱祖国爱人民的精神，要保卫我们可爱的祖国以及我们的妈妈。”我听了真高兴，把孩子交给毛主席和人民解放军是不会错的，只有这样，孩子们才能进步，才能有光明的前途。我感到以前的不放心实在是多余的。
    这次的慰问使我得了不少教育。我要告诉亲爱的家长们，我们的孩子都生活在又愉快、又温暖的革命大家庭中，他们懂得了保家卫国的道理，他们更懂得怎样来热爱他们的父母和伟大的祖国。亲爱的家长们，为我们的孩子走上光荣的岗位而高兴吧！
