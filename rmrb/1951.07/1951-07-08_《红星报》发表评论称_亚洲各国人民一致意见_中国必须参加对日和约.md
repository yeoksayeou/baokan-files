Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: TASS Moscow, June 6th: The *Red Star* newspaper, in a commentary on Dulles' aide Allison's trip to Tokyo, pointed out: The United States' stubborn attempt to obstruct the People's Republic of China from participating in the peace treaty with Japan has met with great opposition from all sectors of Asian countries and has further discredited American policy in the eyes of the people of Asian countries. Therefore, politicians in the United States and Britain decided to push this illegal act onto the Yoshida government, ostensibly letting the Yoshida government decide whether it is willing to conclude a peace treaty with the only legitimate government of the People's Republic of China, or whether it is willing to conclude a peace treaty with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Thus, Allison was given a difficult mission to go to Japan, namely, to persuade the Japanese rulers to bear the responsibility for the shameful decision to prevent the People's Republic of China from participating in the peace treaty with Japan. However, this mission ended in failure. *Red Star* pointed out: Yoshida did not dare to publicly support the suggestion of inviting representatives of the Kuomintang clique to participate in the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. He openly expressed dissatisfaction with the United States and Britain's move to pass the responsibility for deciding this issue to himself.

*Red Star* concluded: Without the participation of the People's Republic of China in preparing the peace treaty with Japan, a genuine peace treaty in the Far East is impossible, and the people of Asian countries are well aware of this. Allison's mission to Tokyo has shown that Yoshida and his masters have found it increasingly difficult to ignore this irrefutable fact.

### 《红星报》发表评论称  亚洲各国人民一致意见  中国必须参加对日和约

　　《红星报》发表评论称
    亚洲各国人民一致意见     
    中国必须参加对日和约
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：《红星报》在评论杜勒斯的助手艾利逊东京之行时指出：美国阻挠中华人民共和国参加对日和约的顽固企图，遇到亚洲国家各界的极大反对，并使美国的政策在亚洲各国人民的眼睛中进一步威信扫地。因此，美、英两国的政客们就决定把这种非法行为推给吉田政府，表面上让吉田政府来决定它愿意和唯一合法的中华人民共和国政府缔结和约，还是愿意与蒋介石匪帮残余缔结和约。
    于是，艾利逊奉到一个艰难的使命前往日本，即说服日本统治者来承担阻止中华人民共和国参加对日和约之可耻决定的责任。但是，这一使命却归于失败了。红星报指出：吉田不敢公开支持邀请国民党集团代表参加签订对日和约的建议。他对美、英把决定这一问题的责任推卸给他自己的举动，公开表示不满。
    红星报在结语中指出：没有中华人民共和国参加准备对日和约，远东的真正的和约是不可能的，亚洲各国人民都很了解这一点。艾利逊赴东京的使命已说明，吉田及其主子们已发现愈来愈难无视这一不可驳倒的事实。
