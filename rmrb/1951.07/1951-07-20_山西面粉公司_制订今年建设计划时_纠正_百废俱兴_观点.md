Shanxi Flour Company
Corrects "Everything is Waiting to be Rebuilt" Viewpoint When Formulating This Year's Construction Plan

　　When formulating the basic construction plan for 1951, Shanxi Flour Company grasped a basic principle: to do things well while also saving funds. To achieve this goal, they first corrected the "everything is waiting to be rebuilt" viewpoint of the leading cadres of each factory and relied on the masses to leverage everyone's wisdom to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds.

　　Because leading comrades of each factory held the idea that "everything is waiting to be rebuilt," they only proceeded from subjective requirements without considering the objective investment possibilities, and thus the proposed basic construction plans were relatively large (such as Flour Factory No. 1 adding floating ladders, Yuci Factory repairing offices and replacing headstocks, Pingyao Factory building new warehouses, etc.). These plans seem necessary from the perspective of each factory, but from the perspective of the overall financial situation and our basic construction investment policy, they can be postponed or solved by other methods. Based on this situation, the Flour Company convened a factory director meeting in January. The meeting pointed out that factory construction should have priorities, and the viewpoint of "everything is waiting to be rebuilt" must be opposed. According to state investment, combined with the actual situation and existing conditions, the company determined what to do first, what to postpone or not do at all, based on the order of importance and urgency. The company also researched specific methods: (1) Plan carefully and strive to reduce costs. (2) Resolutely rely on workers to find solutions. (3) Use waste materials and technology to make up for insufficient investment. This meeting laid the foundation for the plan formulation work.

　　During the formulation of the plan, many funds were saved by mobilizing and relying on the staff and workers to think of more solutions. Most of the power for the Pingyao factory can be repaired using waste machinery and materials from Factory No. 1, avoiding repairs that do not directly affect power, such as doors and windows. The headstock of the Yuci factory can be thickened by electric welding. This allowed investment to be used for necessary and urgently needed projects, and smaller funds were able to exert greater effectiveness.

　　In implementing the plan, attention was also paid to mobilizing the masses and establishing a responsibility system. Combined with the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, Flour Factory No. 1 conducted ideological mobilization and organizational division of labor before construction, determining who was responsible for collecting waste materials, who was mainly responsible for technology, and so on. The masses changed the toothed wheels on the purifier to belt pulleys and used waste materials. As a result, the money originally planned to make two purifiers can now be used to make three, saving 42.28% of the investment. Pingyao Factory needed a double-crankshaft to repair two 100-horsepower gas engines. The original plan was to use more than 100,000 jin of rice. After inquiring in Shanghai, it would require 420,000 jin of rice, which would take up the company's entire investment. After everyone's research, the plan was to repair the factory's abandoned 200-horsepower gas engine to replace it, only needing to replace one shaft, which would be enough with 240,000 jin of rice.

### 山西面粉公司  制订今年建设计划时  纠正“百废俱兴”观点

　　山西面粉公司
　  制订今年建设计划时
　  纠正“百废俱兴”观点
    山西面粉公司在制订一九五一年的基本建设计划时，掌握了一个基本精神，就是既要把事情办好，又要节省资金。为了达到这个目的，他们首先纠正了各厂领导干部的“百废俱兴”观点，并且依靠群众，发挥大家的智慧解决了资金不足的困难。
    由于各厂领导同志存在着“百废俱兴”思想，只从主观要求出发，而未考虑客观的投资可能，因而提出的基本建设计划都比较庞大（如面粉一厂增加浮梯，榆次厂修办公室更换天轴，平遥厂新建仓库等）。这些计划从本厂看来是需要的，但从整个财政情况，及我们基本建设投资方针上来看，那就可以缓办，或者可以用其他方法来解决的。据此情况，面粉公司于一月间召开了厂长会议，会议指出建厂要有重点，必须反对“百废俱兴”的观点。根据国家投资，结合实际情况及现有条件，分别轻重缓急，决定先办什么，缓办或不办什么，并研究出具体的办法：（１）严密计划，力求节减。（２）坚决依靠工人想办法。（３）不足的投资利用废料与技术补救解决。这次会议，给制订计划工作打下了基础。
    在制定计划时，由于发动和依靠职工群众多想办法，节省了不少资金。平遥厂动力大部可利用一厂废机料整修；免去了不直接影响动力的修建，如门窗等。榆次厂的天轴可用电焊加粗。这样使投资用在了必要和急需的工程上，较少的资金就能够发挥较大的效用。
    在实行计划时，也注意了发动群众并建立责任制。结合着抗美援朝爱国主义运动，面粉一厂在施工前，进行了思想动员与组织分工，确定了谁负搜集废料责任，谁负技术上主要责任等等。群众将元罗上的牙轮改用皮带轮，利用废料，结果，原计划做两部元罗的钱，现在可以做成三部，节省投资百分之四十二点二八。平遥厂装修一百马力煤汽机二部，需双弯轴一根，原计划用米十余万斤，经向上海打听，需四十二万斤米，将占去该公司全部投资。经大家研究后，计划修复该厂废置的二百马力煤气机来代替，只换一根轴，用二十四万斤米就够了。
