Congratulatory Telegram from the Tunisian Communist Party on the 30th Anniversary of the CCP

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,

Dear Comrades:

    On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the great Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party extends to you its warmest congratulations.

    Under the leadership of the Party of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have thoroughly defeated American imperialism and its running dogs and have won national independence. Our people, who are fighting against French imperialism and its American masters, have always followed the heroic struggle of the Chinese people with keen interest.

    The Tunisian people recognize that the historic victory of the Chinese people has dealt a fatal blow to imperialism and greatly strengthened the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union—the socialist state, the state of Lenin and Stalin. The Tunisian people also recognize that the inspiring victory of the Chinese people has greatly promoted the struggle of the colonial peoples for their national independence.

    On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, we are confident that we represent all the people of our country in sincerely wishing you complete success in your efforts to achieve lasting peace and to build a socialist road for a new China for the working people.

    Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the unity of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace and national independence!

    Representative of the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, Mohammed Ennafaa
        July 7, 1951
