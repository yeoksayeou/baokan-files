    On or around August 1st, all general branches and provincial and municipal branches should organize condolence groups to visit hospitals and revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools to express their condolences to the wounded and sick soldiers and disabled soldiers. Where your strength cannot reach, you can ask the local people's government and mass organizations to handle it. In addition, we also suggest that you and the local government and all sectors of society organize theater troupes and film projection teams to accompany you for condolence performances, or mobilize local theaters and cinemas to perform for labor.
    When visiting hospitals and revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, small-scale forums or other meetings can be held to encourage them to maintain their honor, abide by the rules, and strengthen their will to continue participating in combat or work. It is necessary to widely publicize to them the current situation and the situation of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and economic construction, in order to improve their political level and patriotic enthusiasm.
