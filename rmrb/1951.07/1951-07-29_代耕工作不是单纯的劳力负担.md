　　Substitute Farming is Not Just a Labor Burden
To the Editor:

　　Substitute farming is a mass patriotic mutual aid movement. Leadership organs in all localities must continuously conduct propaganda and education among the masses regarding support for the army and preferential treatment for the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers, so that the masses deeply recognize that respecting and helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers is their glorious duty. However, as far as I know, some local leading cadres are neglecting to educate the masses about supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers, and are viewing substitute farming work as merely a burden on the masses. As a result, the masses cannot fully understand the political significance of substitute farming work, which affects the implementation of preferential policies.

　　Leading cadres in some areas excessively emphasize the issue of balancing the burden of substitute farming between different areas. For example, in Limin Zao Village, First District, Datong County, Chahar Province, each laborer averages 2.3 workdays per year on substitute farming, while in Aizhuang Village in the same district, the average is 0.4 workdays, and in Jiezhuang and Nanliuzhuang Villages, the average is 0.3 workdays. The Chahar Province working group believes that this is an uneven distribution of the burden of substitute farming and has proposed that the district implement unified labor management. Originally, appropriately adjusting substitute farming labor between regions was just a method to solve the difficulty of individual villages with too many families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers being unable to independently carry out substitute farming. If the burden of substitute farming varies between villages, but the villages with heavier burdens are not affected in carrying out their own substitute farming work, then there is no need to implement labor adjustment between villages. Because indiscriminately and absolutely equalizing the unified management of substitute farming labor across the entire district, regardless of need or circumstances, will cause cadres and the masses to ignore the political significance of substitute farming work and focus their attention on issues of interest such as the labor burden. In these areas, there is often the phenomenon of concealing the village's labor and livestock and expanding the village's substitute farming area without principle. For example, in the Second District of Hejian County, Hebei Province, 56 out of 62 villages concealed manpower and livestock. In Leting County and the Eighth District of Baodi County, Hebei Province, the area of substitute farming was expanded to 83 percent. More seriously, in many villages, in order to report more workdays for substitute farming in their own village and avoid seeking rice from other villages, even helping the families of soldiers carry water is counted as workdays. This phenomenon is closely related to the local leading cadres' neglect of the political significance of substitute farming work and their economistic thinking that views substitute farming work as merely a burden on the masses. It is hoped that all localities will seriously examine and correct this erroneous thinking and pay attention to politically inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for substitute farming.

### 代耕工作不是单纯的劳力负担

　　代耕工作不是单纯的劳力负担编辑同志：
    代耕工作是群众性的爱国互助运动。各地领导机关必须对群众不断进行拥军优属的宣传教育，使群众深刻地认识到尊重和帮助烈军属及革命残废军人是自己的光荣义务。但是，就我所知，现在有一些地区的领导干部，却忽视了对群众进行拥军优属的教育，而把代耕工作看成是单纯的群众负担。因此，就使群众不能很好地认识代耕工作的政治意义，影响了优抚政策的贯彻。
    某些地区的领导干部过分地强调了地区间代耕负担的平衡问题。如察哈尔省大同县一区利民皂村，每一个劳动力平均全年在代耕上要出二点三个工，同区的艾庄平均是零点四个工，解庄、南六庄平均是零点三个工，察哈尔省工作组便认为这是代耕负担的畸轻畸重，提出要求该区实行劳力统筹。本来，实行地区间代耕劳力的适当调剂，只是为了解决个别烈军属过多村庄无力单独进行代耕困难的一种方法。如果村与村间的代耕负担虽然有轻重，但负担较重的村庄并不影响自己代耕工作的进行，便可不必实行村与村间的劳力调剂。因为不问需要不分情况而绝对平均主义地实行全区的代耕劳力统筹，就会使干部和群众忽视代耕工作的政治意义，把注意力集中到劳力负担等利害问题上去。在这些地区里，常常会发生匿报本村劳力、畜力，无原则地扩大本村代耕面等现象。如河北省河间县二区共六十二村，隐瞒人力、畜力的村子竟达五十六村。河北省乐亭县和宝坻县八区代耕面均扩大到百分之八十三。更严重的是，有许多村庄，为了给本村多报代耕工而免得向外村找米，连帮军属挑水也得计上工。这种现象，是和当地的领导干部忽视代耕工作的政治意义，而把代耕工作看成单纯群众负担的经济主义思想是有密切关系的。希望各地认真检查纠正这种错误思想，注意从政治上启发群众的代耕积极性。
