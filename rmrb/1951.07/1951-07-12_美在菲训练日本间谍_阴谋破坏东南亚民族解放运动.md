　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: According to a dispatch from the Telecommunications Agency in Manila: The Philippine-US military authorities are, in accordance with the US State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency's expanded Southeast Asia spy network plan, running special spy training classes in the Philippines. The main purpose of this spy network plan is to undermine the Southeast Asian national liberation movement.

　　In addition to close collusion with reactionary political parties and their secret organizations in various parts of Southeast Asia, US imperialism is also restoring the former Japanese intelligence agencies, so that Japanese agents who previously operated in Southeast Asia will undertake the main tasks. In January of this year, when US Central Intelligence Agency Director Smith visited Tokyo, he met with Iwaguro (transliteration), the head of Japanese agents who had operated in Southeast Asia in the past, many times, and decided that Iwaguro would establish an intelligence organization in the name of the "Special Investigation Bureau." The organization is under the command of the Intelligence Division of the US Military Headquarters in Tokyo. Smith also instructed Iwaguro to make full use of trade relations between Japan and Southeast Asian countries to engage in espionage activities.

　　美在菲训练日本间谍
    阴谋破坏东南亚民族解放运动
    【新华社十日讯】据电通社马尼拉讯：菲律宾美国军事当局，正根据美国国务院和中央情报局的扩大东南亚间谍网计划，在菲律宾开办间谍特别训练班。这一间谍网计划的主要目的是破坏东南亚民族解放运动。
    美帝国主义除了和东南亚各地的反动政党及它们的秘密组织密切勾结外，并正在恢复以前的日本特务机关，使过去在东南亚活动的日本特务，担当主要的任务。今年一月间，美国中央情报局局长史密斯到东京时，曾和过去在东南亚活动的日本特务头子岩黑（译音）会议多次，决定由岩黑以“特别调查局”名义建立特务组织。该组织归东京美军总部情报处指挥。史密斯并指令岩黑要尽量利用日本与东南亚国家的贸易关系来从事间谍活动。
