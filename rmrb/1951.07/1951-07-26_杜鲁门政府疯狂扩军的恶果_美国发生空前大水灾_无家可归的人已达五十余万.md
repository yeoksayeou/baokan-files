　　The Evil Consequences of the Truman Government's Mad Military Expansion
　  Unprecedented Floods in the United States
　  More Than Half a Million People Homeless
    [Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 24th] News: Because the Truman government drastically cut spending on water conservancy and other social programs, while using huge sums of money for military expansion, the Mississippi River, the largest river in the United States, recently flooded, causing the worst flood in the United States in over a century.
    According to a United Press report, the Missouri River breached its banks last week at the junction of Kansas and Missouri, and the floodwaters inundated vast areas of the two states. The floodwaters flowing downstream caused the Mississippi River to rise sharply and overflow at its confluence with the Missouri River. At the confluence of the two rivers, all levees were breached or overflowed in a twenty-square-mile area. In this area alone, more than 300,000 mu of land was flooded. For ninety miles downstream from the confluence, nearly 200,000 mu of low-lying land is in a very dangerous situation.
    The floodwaters flowed over more than one million mu of land, destroying many railroads, highways, houses, and power lines, and inundated several industrial areas, causing enormous damage. In St. Louis alone, industrial losses amounted to $3 million. In West Alton, Missouri, the water was ten feet deep. As of the 23rd, the damage caused by the floods exceeded $1 billion, the number of homeless reached more than 500,000, and forty people drowned. Currently, heavy rains continue to fall in Missouri, Kansas, and Illinois, and the river levels are rising. At the same time, the Mississippi River flood continues to surge south, threatening vast farmlands along the river to the Gulf of Mexico.
    The Truman government, which is spending tens of billions of dollars on armaments, allocated a total of less than $600,000 last week to express "relief" to the flood victims in Missouri and Illinois. That is to say, each homeless victim received only one dollar on average, and those who were severely affected by the disaster without becoming homeless did not even receive one dollar.

　　杜鲁门政府疯狂扩军的恶果
　  美国发生空前大水灾
　  无家可归的人已达五十余万
    【新华社二十四日讯】华盛顿消息：由于杜鲁门政府大量削减水利及其他社会事业费用而把巨额金钱用于扩军，美国最大的河流密士失必河最近洪水泛滥，造成美国百余年来最大的水灾。
    据合众社消息，美国密苏里河于上周在堪萨斯州及密苏里州交界处决堤，河水侵袭两州广大地区。顺流而下的洪水在与密士失必河汇流处使密士失必河河水也猛涨泛溢。在两河交流处二十平方英里地段，所有河堤全被洪水冲决或漫溢。单在这一地区，全部被淹土地就达三十万亩以上。自汇流处以下九十英里沿岸近二十万亩的低地，形势十分危急。
    洪水流过百余万亩面积的土地，冲毁许多铁路、公路、民房和电线，并侵入若干工业地区，造成巨大破坏，仅圣路易城一地，工业因此遭受的损失就达三百万美元。在密苏里州的西阿尔冬城，水深达十英尺。到二十三日止，洪水所造成的破坏已超过十亿美元，无家可归的人数达五十余万，淹死者四十人。现在，密苏里、堪萨斯和伊利诺斯三州正续降大雨，各河水势益涨。同时，密士失必河洪水继续汹涌南下，威胁着沿河直到墨西哥湾两岸大片农田。
    以几百亿美元用于军备的杜鲁门政府在上周拨了总共不到六十万美元对密苏里和伊利诺斯两州灾民表示“救济”，就是说，平均每个无家可归的灾民只得到一块美元，不是无家可归而受灾甚重的人就连一块美元也得不到。
