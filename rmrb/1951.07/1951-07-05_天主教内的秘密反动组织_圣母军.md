The Secret Reactionary Organization within the Catholic Church - The Legion of Mary

(I) The Political Background of the Legion of Mary's Emergence

The Legion of Mary, also known as the Servants of Mary, was founded in Dublin, Ireland, on September 7, 1921. It is an international reactionary fascist organization within the Catholic Church. It emerged in the historical context of world capitalism entering a period of general crisis. In order to maintain their system of enslaving and exploiting the working people, and to save themselves from demise, the financial oligarchs of the capitalist bloc intensified their utilization of religion. The Legion of Mary is a reactionary organization of "Catholic Action" that, as Liberio Riccio said, is "specially decorated with special attractions and suggestions." (See Legion of Mary Handbook, page 17).

The "Legion of Mary Handbook" explicitly acknowledges the political background of the Legion of Mary's emergence. This handbook is the highest guiding theoretical text published by the Legion of Mary headquarters, and it "includes the principles, rules, methods, and spirit of the organization that members should understand" (Handbook, page 117), and is prescribed as the standard for establishing the Legion of Mary in various locations and a required reading for members. It reads: "This new knight (referring to the Legion of Mary) has emerged in this age of wavering faith. Our current era…the ranks of atheism have spread poisonous thoughts to every corner, with the ambition of sweeping the world and encompassing everything" (Handbook, page 39). However, the handbook believes that what is more serious is that the original "Catholic organizations" and bishops, priests, etc., have been unable to reverse this situation. Because the working people have already seen through the ugly faces of this group of missionaries who wear the cloak of religion to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and no longer believe them, "and have stirred up a wave of resistance against the clergy, expelling them." Under these circumstances, there is a need for another organization and personnel that can represent the bishops and priests to carry out reactionary activities. Thus, "the Legion of Mary has emerged in accordance with modern needs," and "the Legion of Mary can exert its greatest effectiveness here; it can represent the priests in going deep among the people and implementing the priests' plans" (Handbook, page 229).

(II) The True Purpose of the Legion of Mary

Since the Legion of Mary was born in the aforementioned historical circumstances, its true purpose is quite obvious: in capitalist countries, it is to strengthen the influence of religious deception among the working people, to undermine the unity and struggle of the working people, in order to maintain the reactionary rule of the financial giants; in people's democratic countries, it is to engage in various sabotage activities, attempting to overthrow the rule of the people and restore the reactionary and dark system in these countries. The Legion of Mary Handbook does not conceal its purpose. It requires its members in capitalist countries to strengthen their work among "those who are struggling in the slums and poverty and those who are in danger of falling," "so that they will forget the divisions and rivalries in society" (Handbook, page 38); in people's democratic countries, "the main purpose and fact of the Legion of Mary" is to "destroy the rule of sin, overthrow its foundation, and erect the banner of Christ's kingdom in its ruins" (Handbook, page 118).

(III) The Legion of Mary is a Reactionary Fascist Secret Organization within the Catholic Church

The Legion of Mary is organized entirely in imitation of the Roman legions of the ancient Roman Empire, which served the despotic tyrants and brutally slaughtered slaves. The Legion of Mary often compares itself to the cruel, barbaric, and murderous ancient Roman army. It has established many extremely strict "prohibitions" and "military discipline," forcing members to obey blindly, and using a strong religious atmosphere to anesthetize members, making them mindless tools that can be manipulated at will.

The Legion of Mary Handbook says: "The Legion of Mary requires members to serve without limitation and without reservation. This is not just an exhortation, but a necessary requirement" (see Handbook, page 6). In order to make members into docile tools, the Legion of Mary uses many deceptive and coercive methods. The Legion of Mary Handbook says: "We deeply recognize our incompetence and insignificance, and quietly wait for Almighty God to use our activities as a tool for its glory when it deems appropriate" (see Handbook, page 101). The Legion of Mary Handbook sternly warns members not to talk about "what sins, corruption, or despotism the church has committed, etc." It says: "The way that members should follow is to pull the problem back to its simplest component, which is that God has descended the gospel to the world" (see Handbook, page 180). The Legion of Mary Handbook also teaches members to cover up all the sins of the reactionary rulers. It warns: "If members want to take the opportunity to expose the darkness and corruption of society and show off, this is absolutely not allowed" (see Handbook, page 205). These are all stipulated as the "military discipline" of the Legion of Mary, forcing members to obey.

The Legion of Mary is a secret reactionary organization. It warns its members "not to be used by overly enthusiastic social reformers. The Legion of Mary's work is fundamentally hidden and invisible." (see Handbook, page 205) It stipulates that members must "strictly maintain secrecy." "Revealing the news obtained at the branch meeting to outsiders is equivalent to betraying the Legion of Mary" (see Handbook, page 166). It also says: "Spreading everything that is heard is equivalent to intolerable rebellion for the legion." (see Handbook, page 112). If the Legion of Mary is merely a religious organization, why should it so strictly warn its members to keep secrets? This alone is enough to prove that it is a reactionary organization that uses religion as a cover to carry out secret sabotage activities.

In order to closely control its members, the Legion of Mary also stipulates that it should meet once a week to "execute the discipline of the army through the method of meeting" (see Handbook, page 164).

The aforementioned extremely reactionary political aims and the most backward, most brutal, and most despotic organizational system of the Legion of Mary clearly illustrate that it is an extremely reactionary fascist organization.

This fascist organization is commanded and supervised by bishops and priests. The Legion of Mary Handbook repeatedly emphasizes the importance of the various levels of the corps being subject to the local bishops and priests. Therefore, it is actually just a tool used by some so-called imperialist elements among the bishops and priests to carry out conspiracies.

(IV) The Legion of Mary's Sabotage Activities in China

In China, the Legion of Mary only began its activities when the Chinese mainland was approaching complete liberation. The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War shattered the imperialists' dream of continuing to enslave and oppress the Chinese people. However, the imperialists were not reconciled to their failure in China. Therefore, they actively used the most reactionary organization, the Legion of Mary, to carry out a dying struggle. The one who initiated this organization and led it was the imperialist element Liberio Riccio, who was recently accused by patriotic Catholic believers across the country. Liberio Riccio said in a letter to his secretary Chen Zhemin in February 1949: "The Legion of Mary can be suitable for any social atmosphere, such as parishes, schools, factories, armies...and become "the thought and action that permeates everything," so that "the Kingdom of Christ (should be read as the rule of imperialism) in China will not only not feel any loss or decline, but will further develop and continue its sacred rights."

Therefore, as the victory of the Chinese people rapidly developed, imperialist elements like Liberio Riccio actively established and developed the Legion of Mary in various places. In 1948, Liberio Riccio summoned his assistant, an Irish priest named Mochkin, to China. Before coming to China, Mochkin went to Ireland and the United States to receive specialized training in organizing the Legion of Mary. After arriving in China, he was ordered by Liberio Riccio to be responsible for the organizational work of the Legion of Mary within the Catholic Educational Association. In August of the same year, Liberio Riccio sent Mochkin to Tianjin to assist Wen Guibin in organizing the Legion of Mary. Later, Liberio Riccio sent him to Guangzhou, Guilin, Sichuan and other places to develop this reactionary organization. Now this reactionary organization has been found in many places in the Catholic Church throughout the country.

Under the leadership of Liberio Riccio, the Legion of Mary carried out various sabotage activities against People's China. According to the materials that have been revealed in Tianjin, the reactionary activities of the Legion of Mary are roughly as follows: (1) Absorbing large numbers of fleeing landlords, bullies, bandits, secret agents, and other backward elements in order to expand their reactionary organization; at the same time, changing the name to the Holy Mother's Charitable Prayer Meeting and requesting the People's Government to approve registration, attempting to win legal status. After this conspiracy was exposed, it immediately divided into groups, attempting to lie dormant for a long time. (2) Frequently holding secret meetings, exchanging intelligence, and discussing and arranging sabotage activities. For example, a branch of the Legion of Mary in Tianjin, under the leadership of the Dutch priest Man Jishi, organized the "St. Augustine Catechism Study Class," listening to the broadcasts of the "Voice of America," and spreading rumors wildly. For example, when patriotic young people in Tianjin enthusiastically signed up to participate in military cadre schools, the Legion of Mary sent members to the homes of patriotic young students to spread rumors and obstruct them. (3) Publishing and distributing reactionary books and periodicals, such as "Answers to Modern Questions," "Terrorist Communism," etc. (4) Slandering the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the people's leaders; in church schools, attacking Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and progressive students. (5) Actively helping imperialist elements such as Wen Guibin to undermine the Catholic Three-Self Reform Movement, such as distributing reactionary documents such as "Learning Reference" that undermine the Three-Self Movement, preventing believers from signing the reform declaration, and deceiving and intimidating progressive believers. (6) Using terrorist means, such as writing anonymous letters and assassinating patriotic believers, to disrupt social order and endanger patriotic believers (such as the Man Jishi case recently uncovered in Tianjin).

However, the sabotage activities of the Legion of Mary are futile, and the great strength of the people will surely crush its dying struggle. Even the chief evil elements of the Legion of Mary feel the tragic prospect of their future. Please see what the Legion of Mary Handbook says: "Compared with this terrible lineup (referring to the great power of the people), how small is the Legion of Mary!" (Handbook, page 39). Chinese priests and believers who have been deceived into joining the Legion of Mary should quickly wake up and quickly break away from this reactionary organization. The Chinese people will never allow this reactionary organization to continue to exist and operate.

### 天主教内的秘密反动组织——圣母军

　　天主教内的秘密反动组织——圣母军
   （一）圣母军产生的政治背景
    圣母军又名圣母御侍团，一九二一年九月七日成立于爱尔兰杜柏林。它是天主教内部国际性的反动法西斯组织。它是在世界资本主义已经进入总危机时期的历史情况下产生的。资本主义集团的金融寡头们为了要维护他们的奴役和剥削劳动人民的制度，为了要拯救自身的死亡，因此更加强了对于宗教的利用，圣母军便是一个如黎培里所说的“别具装璜、有特别引力与暗示的公教进行”的反动组织。（见圣母军手册十七页）。
    “圣母军手册”明白地供认了圣母军产生的政治背景。这本手册是圣母军总部出版的最高指导理论的读本，它“包括团员所应该认识的原理、规则、方法以及组织的精神”（手册一一七页），被规定为各地建立圣母军的准则和团员必须学习的读物。它如此写道：“这个新的骑士（按指圣母军），在这个信仰动摇的今天产生了。我们现在的时代……无神论的阵容，已将恶毒的思潮传遍了每一角落，大有席卷世界、包举天下的气概”（手册三十九页）。但是，手册认为更严重的，是原来的“公教组织”和主教、司铎等等已经无法挽回这种局势。因为劳动人民已经看清了这批披着宗教外衣，进行反革命活动的传教士的丑恶嘴脸，不再相信他们，“而卷起了反抗教士、驱逐他们的怒涛”。在这种情况下，便需要另一种能够代表主教、司铎来进行反动活动的组织和人员，于是，“圣母军准着近代的需要而产生了”，“圣母军在这里能发挥它最大的效力，它能代表司铎深入民间，实行司铎的计划”（手册二二九页）。
   （二）圣母军的真正目的
    既然圣母军是在前述的历史情况下产生的，它的真正的目的也就十分显然：在资本主义国家里，它是为了加强宗教在劳动人民中间的麻醉欺骗影响，破坏劳动人民的团结和斗争，以便维护金融巨头的反动统治；在人民民主主义的国家中，它便要从事各种破坏活动，妄图推翻人民的统治，使反动黑暗的制度在这些国家中复辟。圣母军手册并不掩饰它的目的，它要求它的团员在资本主义国家里，要加强对于“那些在贫民窟与穷苦奋斗的人和那些有危险堕落的人”进行工作，“使他们忘却社会的分裂、倾轧，”（手册三八页）；在人民民主国家里，“圣母军的主要目的和事实”便是要“毁灭罪恶的统治，推翻它的基础，在它的残碑断碣里树立起基督神国的旗帜”（手册一一八页）。
   （三）圣母军是天主教内部的反动法西斯秘密组织
    圣母军是完全仿照古罗马帝国时代为专制暴君效命、残酷地屠杀奴隶的罗马军团而组织的。圣母军经常将自己比喻为残酷野蛮、杀人如麻的古罗马军。它订立了许多极严厉的“禁诫”和“军纪”，强迫团员盲目地服从，并用浓厚的宗教气氛来麻醉团员，使团员成为毫无思想的、可以任意摆布的工具。
    圣母军手册说：“圣母军要求团员服务，是无限制，无保留的，这并不只是一种劝告，乃是必然的要求”（见手册第六页）。为了要使团员成为驯服的工具，圣母军便施用了许多欺骗和强制的办法。圣母军手册说：“我们深深地自认我们无能，卑不足道，静待全能天主认为合宜的时候，用我们的活动作为它光荣的工具”（见手册一○一页）。圣母军手册严厉地警戒团员不要谈“关于教会犯了什么罪恶、腐败、专制等等”的事情，它说：“团员该遵循的方式是把问题拉回到最简单的成份上去，即是天主给世界降下了福音”（见手册一八○页）。圣母军手册同时教导团员要掩盖一切反动统治者的罪恶，它警告说：“如果团员想借着机会，揭发社会的黑暗与腐败，出出风头，这是绝不可以的”（见手册二○五页）。这些并且都被规定为圣母军的“军纪”，强制团员服从。
    圣母军是一种秘密活动的反动组织，它警告它的团员“勿为太热心的社会改革家所利用。圣母军工作，根本是隐而不现。”（见手册二○五页）它规定团员要“严守秘密”。“把在支团集会里所得到的消息，给外人透露出来，那是等于出卖圣母军”（见手册一六六页）。又说：“收听到的一切散布出去，对于军团，是等于不可容忍的叛逆。”（见手册一一二页）。试问如果圣母军仅仅是一种宗教组织，它为什么要如此严格的警诫其团员保守秘密呢？就这一点，已足以证明它是以宗教为掩护的一种进行秘密破坏活动的反动组织。
    为了要紧密地控制团员，圣母军又规定每周集会一次，“借着集会的方法，执行军中的纪律”（见手册一六四页）。
    上述圣母军的极端反动的政治目的和最落后、最残暴、最专制的组织制度，明显地说明了它是一个极反动的法西斯组织。
    这个法西斯组织是由主教和司铎来指挥、监督的。圣母军手册反复地强调各级团部应当受当地主教、司铎的支配的重要性，因此它本身实际上也不过是被一些所谓主教、司铎的帝国主义分子利用来进行阴谋活动的工具。
            （四）圣母军在中国的破坏活动
    在中国，圣母军是在中国大陆接近全部解放时才开始活动的。中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，粉碎了帝国主义继续奴役和压迫中国人民的幻梦；但是帝国主义并不甘心他们在中国的失败，因此他们就积极利用最反动的组织圣母军来进行垂死的挣扎。发起这个组织并且领导着它的，便是最近被全国天主教爱国教徒起而控诉的帝国主义分子黎培里。黎培里在一九四九年二月写给他的秘书陈哲敏的信中说：“圣母军能对任何的社会氛围，如本堂区、学校、工厂、军队……都无往而不适宜”，可以成为“参透一切的思想和行动”，从而使“基督的神国（应读作帝国主义的统治）在中国不但不感到损失而消沉，反而更进一步的发展，继续它神圣的权利。”
    因此，当中国人民的胜利迅速发展时，黎培里一类帝国主义分子也就积极地在各地建立和发展圣母军。一九四八年，黎培里把他的助手爱尔兰籍神父莫克勤召来中国，莫克勤在来华前，曾到爱尔兰和美国去受组织圣母军的专门训练。他到中国以后，即奉黎培里之命，在天主教教务协进委员会内负责圣母军的组织工作。同年八月，黎培里派遣莫克勤赴天津协助文贵宾组织圣母军。其后，黎培里又派他到广州、桂林、四川等地去发展这个反动的组织。现在全国很多地方的天主教内都发现了这个反动组织。
    圣母军在黎培里的领导下，对人民中国进行了各种破坏活动。根据天津已揭发出来的材料，圣母军的反动活动大致有下列几种，（一）大量吸收逃亡地主、恶霸、土匪、特务和其他落后分子，以扩大其反动组织；同时改用圣母慈爱祈祷会的名义，要求人民政府准予登记，企图争取合法地位。这一阴谋被揭穿以后，立刻又分成小组，企图长期潜伏。（二）经常秘密集会，交换情报，讨论和布置进行破坏活动。例如天津圣母军某支团在荷籍神父满济世的领导下曾组织“圣奥斯定要理研究班”，收听“美国之音”的广播，大肆造谣。又如当天津市爱国青年热烈地报名参加军事干部学校时，圣母军曾分别派出团员到爱国青年学生的家中去散播谣言，进行阻挠。（三）出版和散布反动书刊，如《现代问题解答》、《恐怖的共产主义》等等。（四）污蔑共产党、人民政府和人民领袖；在教会学校中，打击共产党员、青年团员和进步学生。（五）积极地帮助文贵宾等帝国主义分子破坏天主教三自革新运动，例如散发“学习参考”等破坏三自运动的反动文件，阻止教徒在革新宣言上签名，向进步教徒进行欺骗、威吓等。（六）用恐怖手段，如写匿名信、暗杀等反革命行为来破坏社会治安，危害爱国教徒（如最近天津所破获的满济世案件，即是）。
    但是圣母军的破坏活动是徒然的，人民的巨大力量必定会粉碎它的垂死挣扎。甚至连圣母军的首恶分子也感觉到他们前途的悲惨，请看圣母军手册所说的话吧：“与这可怖的阵容（指人民的巨大力量）一比较，圣母军是如何渺小呢！”（手册三九页）。被骗加入圣母军的中国神甫、教徒们应该赶快觉悟，迅速脱离这个反动组织。中国人民也绝不允许这个反动组织继续存在和活动。
