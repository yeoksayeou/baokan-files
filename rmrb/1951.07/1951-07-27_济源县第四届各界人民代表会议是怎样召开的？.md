Editor's Note: The Fourth Session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Jiyuan County, Pingyuan Province, exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Although this meeting had some shortcomings, it implemented the basic system of national political power construction, adopted appropriate election methods, ensured the broadness, purity, and full representativeness of the attending representatives, and fully utilized the method of democratic consultation. These aspects were fundamentally successful. Currently, North China is preparing to convene a county head conference. We are introducing the example of Jiyuan County to allow other counties to learn from this experience. Because at present, many regions' leading organs and leading cadres lack sufficient understanding of the basic system of people's political power, the People's Representatives Conference; some places have held People's Representatives Conferences of All Circles multiple times, but still adopt a passive attitude towards its exercise of the functions and powers of the People's Congress; many regions' People's Representatives Conferences are confused with ordinary cadre meetings; cadre-managed elections, closed-doorism; and the handling of various proposals from the people are not serious or earnest, as well as other undemocratic work styles, which urgently need to be corrected.

　　The Fourth Session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Jiyuan County, Pingyuan Province, convened on April 11, exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress, elected the county head and members of the government committee, and approved the report on the guiding principles and tasks of the county People's Government for 1951. Although this meeting still had some shortcomings in some aspects (for example, the handling of representatives' proposals was not serious enough), the meeting united people from all walks of life to work together and improved cadres' understanding of the construction of people's democratic power, thus making the conference a powerful leader and organizer in the in-depth patriotic production increase movement.

　　Jiyuan County is an old liberated area, and the people have a relatively high level of political awareness. Especially after the land reform movement and the great production movement, people from all walks of life have been fully mobilized and formed an organized force. Since last winter, the county has been actively preparing to enable the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress, consciously combining the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries to carry out ideological education on the construction of democratic political power among the masses. This meeting was able to be successful for the following reasons:

　　First, and most importantly, before the meeting, the cadres' incomplete and incorrect understanding of the People's Representatives Conference was corrected. The county People's Government and the county committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached great importance to this People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, and began preparations two months before the meeting, paying special attention to the ideological education of cadres. The county successively convened two cadre conferences, specially made reports on the issue of the People's Representatives Conference, and organized cadres to conduct specialized study of various documents and instructions related to the People's Representatives Conference. During the study process, they also examined and criticized the cadres' practice of taking over and acting for others, the simple task viewpoint, and the "use viewpoint" in past People's Representatives Conferences of All Circles. This kind of learning that was linked to actual work enabled the majority of cadres to recognize the great significance of the People's Representatives Conference, laying the foundation for the full development of democracy at the conference and quickly completing all the preparations for the conference.

　　Second, the allocation of representative quotas was reasonable, the election methods were democratic, and publicity and education were carried out before and after the election, fully mobilizing the masses, thus ensuring the breadth, purity, and true representativeness of the representatives. The number of representatives for this meeting in the county was determined by the preparatory committee after repeated consultations with representatives from all walks of life. The election of representatives was based on different situations and adopted methods familiar to the masses, including direct election, indirect election, recommendation, and invitation. For example, in villages with concentrated residents, the electoral meeting directly elected representatives. In administrative villages including several natural villages, each natural village first elected representative candidates, and then mutually elected formal representatives. The method of election was mostly by raising hands, and a few were by voting and "casting beans." However, the reason why these methods could be implemented and representative figures could be elected was that the county convened a county-wide cadre meeting and teacher meeting, organized a propaganda team, and combined the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, using gatherings, symposiums, blackboards, and broadcasts to widely conduct publicity and education among people from all walks of life, explaining the significance of convening the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, and making the masses aware of the importance of this People's Representatives Conference of All Circles that exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. The matter of democratically electing the county head and government committee members was almost known to every household in the county. People from all walks of life were very careful about the election of representatives. Only a few villages had improper elections, but after the county and district leadership departments promptly pointed this out, they re-elected the figures they loved. Therefore, all 292 representatives in the county were fully qualified. Before attending the meeting, most of the representatives widely listened to the opinions of the voters and collected proposals through methods such as seminars and visits, truly giving play to the role of the people's representatives.

　　Third, the representatives were given patriotic education, which improved their political awareness, so the central topics of the meeting were successfully resolved. On the first day of the meeting, the CCP representative first gave a report on the current situation, followed by group discussions and a large symposium. In the symposium, many representatives linked their own households and villages to the country, recalling the contrasting lives before and after liberation, and arousing the representatives' patriotic enthusiasm and hatred for American imperialism. Finally, they unanimously passed the ten patriotic covenants of the people of the county. This high degree of patriotic enthusiasm of all the representatives unified everyone's thinking and actions, and starting from a common goal, they negotiated and resolved the major issues entrusted by the people of the county.

　　Fourth, the spirit of democratic consultation was fully developed, and all the important reports and resolutions passed by the meeting were satisfactory to all the representatives. For example, the report on the guiding principles and tasks of the county People's Government for 1951, the county People's Government had conducted detailed research in advance and repeatedly consulted with representatives from all aspects, making multiple supplements and revisions, and therefore won the unanimous support of all the representatives. Another example is the list of candidates for county head and government committee members, which was repeatedly consulted with representatives from all aspects before the meeting, and submitted to the representative delegations for deliberation and discussion before the election, and adjustments were made to those that were inappropriate. Therefore, the official election results showed that the number of votes in favor of the candidate list accounted for 95% of the total votes. After the election results were announced, all the representatives congratulated the county head and government committee members, and hung red flowers on them, and the masses who came to the city from all over the countryside could attend the celebrations, fully demonstrating the people's love for the government they elected.

　　Fifth, the combination of inside and outside the meeting, not only held the meeting well, but also promoted the central work of the county. Before this People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, the county called on the people of the county to launch a production and work competition, and to welcome the convening of the representative conference with practical actions. During the meeting, people from all walks of life took active actions to complete production and work plans to celebrate the success of the conference. All sectors sent more than 2,100 congratulatory letters to the conference, which greatly encouraged the representatives. In addition, the conference also had exhibitions on hygiene, production, and public security, and thousands of people came to the city every day to visit. Many people specifically visited the representatives to report on the production situation in the village and encourage the representatives to hold a good meeting; while the representatives reported on the meeting to the visiting people and urged them to work hard to complete the production plan, fully demonstrating the connection between the representatives and the broad masses of the people, inspiring the representatives' sense of responsibility, and also expanding the influence of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles and promoting the county's production and construction work.

　　济源县第四届各界人民代表会议是怎样召开的？
　　林洪
    编者按：平原省济源县第四届各界人民代表会议，代行了人民代表大会的职权。这个会议虽然也有缺点，但是它贯彻着国家政权建设的基本制度，采取恰当的选举方式，保障了出席代表的广泛性、纯洁性与充分的代表性，充分地运用了民主协商的方式，这些在基本上都是成功的。目前华北地区正在筹备召开县长会议，我们介绍济源县的例子，是为了使其他县份吸取这个经验。因为现在有不少地区的领导机关和领导干部，对于人民代表会议这个人民政权的基本制度认识不足；有些地方已经开过多次各界人民代表会议，但对于它的代行人民代表大会职权一点，仍采取消极的态度；不少地区的人民代表会议，竟与普通的干部会议相混淆；干部包办选举，关门主义；处理来自人民群众中的各种提案不认真不严肃，以及其他不民主作风等是亟应加以纠正的。
    平原省济源县在四月十一日召开的第四届各界人民代表会议，代行人民代表大会的职权，选举了县长和政府委员会委员，并通过了一九五一年县人民政府的工作方针和任务的报告。这次会议虽在若干方面尚有缺点（例如关于代表提案的处理尚不够认真），但会议是作到了团结各界人民共同工作并提高了干部对人民民主政权建设的认识，因而使代表会成为深入爱国丰产运动的有力的领导者和组织者。
    济源县是老解放区，人民的政治觉悟较高，特别是经过土地改革运动和大生产运动，各阶层人民已充分发动起来，形成了有组织的力量。自去年冬天以来，该县即积极准备使各界人民代表会议代行人民代表大会的职权，有意识地结合抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动，向群众进行了民主政权建设工作的思想教育。这次会议能够开好，还有下面几个原因：
    第一、最重要的是在会前，纠正了干部中存在的对人民代表会议某些不完全正确地认识。该县人民政府和中共县委会领导干部，对于此次各界人民代表会议非常重视，会前两个月就开始了准备工作，而且特别注意对干部的思想教育。该县曾先后召开了两次干部大会，专门作了关于人民代表会议问题的报告，组织了干部进行有关人民代表会议的各种文件和指示的专门学习。在学习过程中，还检查和批判了过去召开各界人民代表会议时干部包办代替的作风、单纯任务观点和“使用观点”。这种联系实际工作的学习，使大多数干部认识了人民代表会议的重大意义，为大会能够充分发扬民主打下了基础，并迅速地作好了大会的一切准备工作。
    第二、代表名额分配合理，选举办法民主，在选举前后又进行了宣传教育，充分发动了群众，因此保证了代表的广泛性、纯洁性和真正的代表性。该县这次会议的代表名额，是由筹备委员会与各界代表人物多次协商后确定的。代表的选举是根据不同情况采取为群众所熟悉的办法，有直接选举、间接选举、推选和邀请四种。如在居民集中的村庄，就由选民大会直接选举。在包括几个自然村的行政村，则先由各自然村选举代表候选人，然后互选正式代表。选举的方式多数是举手表决，少数是投票和“投豆”。但是这些办法所以能够贯彻下去，选出有代表性的人物，还有一个重要原因，就是该县召开了全县干部会、教员会，组织了宣传队，结合抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动，利用集会、座谈、黑板报和广播等方式，向各界人民广泛进行宣传教育，说明召开各界人民代表会议的意义，使群众认识这次代行人民代表大会职权的各界人民代表会议的重要性。民主选举县长和政府委员的事，几乎全县作到家喻户晓。各界人民对于代表的选举都非常慎重。只有个别村庄的选举不当，但经县、区领导部门及时指出后，又重新选举了自己所爱戴的人物。因此全县二百九十二名代表完全合格。大部分代表在出席会议前，都采用座谈和拜访等方式，广泛听取了选民的意见，收集了提案，真正发挥了人民代表的作用。
    第三、向代表进行了爱国主义教育，提高了代表的政治觉悟，因而会议的中心议题都顺利地获得解决。会议的第一天，中共代表首先作了关于目前形势的报告，紧接着进行小组讨论，并召开了一次大型座谈会。许多代表在座谈中，都由一户一村联系到国家，回忆解放前后的对比生活，激发了代表的爱国热情和对于美帝国主义的仇恨，最后一致通过了全县人民的十项爱国公约。全体代表此种高度的爱国热情，统一了大家的思想和行动，从共同的目标出发，协商解决了全县人民所交托的各项重大问题。
    第四、充分发扬了民主协商精神，会议所通过的各项重要报告和决议案，全体代表都很满意。如一九五一年县人民政府工作方针和任务的报告，县人民政府事前经过详细研究，并与各方面的代表人物反复协商，作了多次补充修改，因而获得全体代表的一致拥护。又如县长和政府委员的候选名单，会前即与各方面的代表人物多次协商，选举前又提交各代表团酝酿讨论，不适当的便作了调整。因此正式选举结果，投票赞成候选名单的占总票数的百分之九十五。选举结果揭晓后，全体代表向县长和政府委员祝贺，为他们挂红戴花，从四乡进城的群众可以列席参加祝贺，充分表现了人民对自己选出的政府的热爱。
    第五、会内和会外互相结合，既开好了会议，又推动了全县的中心工作。该县在此次各界人民代表会议前，即号召全县人民展开了生产和工作竞赛，以实际行动来迎接代表会议的召开。在会议进行期间，各界人民又以完成生产和工作计划的积极行动来祝贺大会的成功。各界给大会的贺信有两千一百多封，对于代表的鼓励很大。此外大会还设有卫生、生产、公安等展览，每日有数千群众进城参观。有许多群众特别拜访代表，报告村里的生产情况，鼓励代表把会开好；而代表则给访问的群众报告开会情形，叮嘱努力完成生产计划，充分表现了代表与广大的人民的联系，启发了代表的责任感，同时也扩大了各界人民代表会议的影响，推动了全县的生产建设工作。
