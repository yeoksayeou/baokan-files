Reader's Letter

    Christian Bishop of Henan, Zeng Youshan
    Encourages Children to Join Military Cadre School Comrades:
    I am writing this letter to you specifically because my youngest daughter, Jianxin, has signed up to participate in the Military Cadre School, to express my respect for you. A sixteen-year-old girl who grew up in our family environment, after a period of happy and enjoyable learning under the sunshine of Mao Zedong, can have such political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm, and voluntarily sign up to participate in this Military Cadre School enrollment. This fully proves that you are correctly and conscientiously leading patriotic education, so that every ambitious young person, when their studies come to an end, has a lofty ideal of serving the motherland and the people, and embraces the great aspiration of contributing their strength to the great project of building our motherland. My daughter Jianxin's noble aspiration and firm and courageous determination make us parents feel infinitely honored.
    On the other hand, I would also like to tell you that when my wife and I were reading the newspaper in the evening and saw the "Decision on Enrolling Students in Various Military Cadre Schools" of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and heard our children Jianxin and Jianping talk about their classmates participating in the Military Cadre School when they came home from school, we immediately thought that Jianxin happened to be graduating from junior high school this season and was just sixteen years old this year, and also thought about how rapidly her thinking had progressed since she studied school administration reform at Yuzhong Middle School; we predicted that one day she would ask us for our opinion on signing up for the Military Cadre School. How contradictory our thoughts were! We went through many days and nights of ideological struggle before we finally overcame our concerns and defeated our emotions. So when Jianxin came home to ask us, our minds were already prepared, so not only did we not object, but we also gave her considerable encouragement. We are sending our daughter off to a glorious and happy future, so we have no unnecessary tears of farewell, only proud smiles. In the beginning, we had many fantasies about our children's education and future, and those fantasies were undoubtedly based on selfish, individual interests. After continuous learning and this ideological struggle, we deeply realized that the most reliable, most glorious, and most happy future for young people in the Mao Zedong era is to serve the people and the motherland.
    We religious professionals and religious believers, except for those few church scum and counter-revolutionaries who are cloaked in religious garb, are mostly kind; however, it is inevitable that we are paralyzed and backward in political understanding and awareness. This is because for more than a hundred years, Christianity has been used, manipulated, controlled, and deceived by imperialists, cultivating that erroneous "supra-political" ideology, and suffering from the influence of many imperialist ideological toxins. But the deception of the imperialists is only temporary. We cannot go against our conscience to erase all objective facts, reverse black and white, and listen to the imperialists' reactionary "supra-political" propaganda, and forget our motherland. Therefore, we are very happy because the children raised in our own family can have such noble aspirations and patriotic enthusiasm, which undoubtedly gives a powerful response to the imperialists and the imperialist elements cloaked in religious garb. Our daughter's determination is firm. We ourselves fully believe that entrusting our children to Chairman Mao is the most appropriate and reassuring thing to do. Therefore, not only do we hope that the organization and leadership will approve her application, but we have also written to encourage our son, who is studying at Zhijiang University in Hangzhou, to also apply to participate in the Military Cadre School. I hope that all parents, especially religious parents, can agree with our views. Because we feel that this is the most practical action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our country and to protect our children's future happiness. This is also the best gift we parents can give to the country in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.
        Bishop of the Henan Diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church, Zeng Youshan

### 基督教河南主教曾友山  鼓励儿女参加军干校

    鼓励儿女参加军干校同志们：
    我为了小女建心本次报名参加军事干部学校，特地写这封信给你们，表示我对你们的敬意。一个自幼在我们这个家庭环境里长大的十六岁少女，在毛泽东的阳光下经过了一段幸福愉快的学习，能有这种政治觉悟和爱国热情，自动报名参加本次军事干部学校的招生，这充分证明了你们正确地、认真地领导着爱国主义的教育，使每个有志的青年，在学习告一段落时，都有了为祖国、为人民服务的崇高理想，都抱着在建设我们祖国的伟大工程中贡献自己力量的伟大志向。小女建心高尚的志向，和坚定勇敢的决心，教我们做家长的觉得是无上的光荣。
    再一方面，我也愿意告诉你们，当我与我的爱人在晚间读报时看到了中央人民政府政务院“关于各种军事干部学校招收学生的决定”，以及听到我们的孩子们建心和建平从学校回家谈到同学们参加军事干部学校的事情，我们当时就想到建心本季正好初中毕业，今年恰好十六岁，又想到她自从豫中中学校政改革学习以后，思想进步的迅速；我们就料定她会有一天向我们征求关于报名参加军干校的意见。我们的思想是如何的矛盾！我们曾经过了多次夜以继日的思想斗争，最后才算克服了我们的顾虑，战胜了我们的情感。所以当建心回家问我们的时候，我们的思想早就准备好了，所以不但没有反对，并且给以相当的鼓励。我们是欢送女儿到光荣幸福的前途，所以我们没有无谓的惜别眼泪，只有骄傲的微笑。当初我们曾为儿女的教育和前途多方幻想，那些幻想，无疑的都是以个人利益为出发点的错误思想。我们自己经过了不断的学习和经过了这一次的思想斗争，深切地体会到，毛泽东时代的青年，最可靠、最光荣、最幸福的前途，乃是为人民、为祖国服务。
    我们从事宗教职业的人和宗教信徒们，除了那少数披着宗教外衣的教会败类、反革命分子外，绝大多数是善良的；不过在政治的认识上和觉悟上却难免有麻痹落后的。这是因为百余年来，基督教被帝国主义者利用、操纵、控制、欺骗，养成了那种错误的“超政治”思想，并蒙受了许多帝国主义思想毒素的影响。但是帝国主义者的欺骗，不过是一时的。我们不能昧着良心去抹杀一切客观事实，颠倒黑白是非，去听从帝国主义者“超政治”的反动宣传，而忘记了我们的祖国。所以我们非常高兴，因为从我们自己的家庭中所养育出来的孩子，能有这种高尚的志向，和爱国热情，这无疑的是给帝国主义者和披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子一个强有力的回答。我们女儿的决心是坚定的。我们自己充分相信把孩子交给毛主席是最妥当、最放心的。所以不但希望组织领导上能批准她的报名，同时我们也已经写信鼓励正在杭州之江大学读书的儿子，也去报名参加军事干部学校。我希望一切父母，尤其是宗教界的父母，能同意我们的意见。因为我们觉得这是抗美援朝保家卫国，也是为保卫我们孩子的将来幸福的最实际的行动。这也是我们作父母的在纪念中国共产党三十周年时给国家的一个最好的礼物。
