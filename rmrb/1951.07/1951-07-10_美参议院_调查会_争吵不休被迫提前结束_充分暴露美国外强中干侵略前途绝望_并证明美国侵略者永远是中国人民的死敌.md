Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Washington dispatch: The so-called "Hearing" jointly held by the U.S. Senate Military and Foreign Affairs Committees to investigate the so-called "MacArthur Incident," after more than seven weeks of noisy arguments, ended on June 25th.

The investigation meeting began on May 3rd. A total of thirteen people testified, including former U.S. Far East Aggressor Army Commander MacArthur, Secretary of Defense Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, Army Chief of Staff Collins, Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg, Chief of Naval Operations Sherman, Secretary of State Acheson, U.S. Commander in China during World War II Wedemeyer, former Secretary of Defense Johnson, former U.S. Far East Fleet Commander Badger, former U.S. Ambassador to Nationalist China Hurley, former head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group to Nationalist China Barr, and former U.S. Far East Strategic Air Force Commander O'Donnell. The testimonies presented at the meeting amounted to more than two million words, constituting an unprecedented "great debate" in the history of the U.S. Congress. The U.S. ruling clique had to hold such an investigation meeting in order to clarify the serious internal disputes caused by the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, and to whitewash the bankrupt aggression policy. However, the investigation meeting over the past seven weeks has only further proved to the people of the world the weakness of U.S. imperialism's aggression, the confusion of aggression steps, and the despair of the aggression future, while the internal disputes continue. Under such circumstances, the Senate Foreign Affairs and Military Affairs Committees had no choice but to reduce the list of originally scheduled witnesses on June 18th and adjourn the meeting early.

This investigation meeting was directly caused by Truman's dismissal of MacArthur, and MacArthur's dismissal was a direct result of the U.S. imperialist aggressor army's disastrous defeat in Korea. The testimonies at the meeting first reflected this fact. MacArthur and the Truman government shirked responsibility for the failure to each other. MacArthur attempted to attribute the failure to Washington's failure to allocate reinforcements and to not adopt his proposals to expand the war by bombing Northeast China, while the military and political leaders of the Truman government, from Marshall and Acheson downwards, defended themselves, saying that the U.S. authorities had indeed made their best efforts to reinforce the U.S. invading army in Korea, but still could not win. At the same time, the U.S. authorities had indeed decided, and even authorized MacArthur to actually attack China with the air force, but later, considering the serious consequences of doing so in the face of repeated defeats of the invading army in Korea, they hesitated about the original ambitious plan.

The testimony quickly turned to a debate on the possible gains and losses of immediately expanding the war of aggression in the Far East. Since then, this issue has become the theme of the so-called "investigation." All the witnesses stated that they agreed in principle on the intention to expand the war of aggression. The difference lies only in the estimation of timing and strength. MacArthur and his supporters advocated making a desperate gamble regardless of the consequences, in an attempt to get lucky. However, this plan was described by Acheson as "measures that responsible military authorities in the United States have determined to be of very doubtful utility in ending the war sooner." In order to clarify the inadvisability of MacArthur's plan, even top war criminals such as Marshall and Bradley had to expose the embarrassing situation of U.S. imperialism's apparent strength but inner weakness in front of the people of the world. They openly admitted that the United States was "not yet ready" militarily (Marshall), and that the United States' "military capabilities are not sufficient to carry out a showdown" (Bradley). Acheson also expressed extreme fear that MacArthur's "approach has serious dangers and other disadvantages," especially that it would "weaken the strength and determination of the coalition united with the United States, thereby weakening the United States' own strength."

The investigation meeting fully confirmed that no matter what type of American imperialists they are, they have always been, and will always be, the deadly enemies of the Chinese people. The testimony revealed that as early as the beginning of Japan's surrender, in addition to the U.S. government actively helping the Kuomintang bandit army attack the liberated areas with huge amounts of military equipment and materials, as well as sea and air transportation, MacArthur had suggested directly attacking and eliminating the Chinese People's Liberation Army with U.S. troops. Marshall also bluntly admitted that when he was Secretary of State, he wanted "the United States to control China," but later, in view of "the general world situation, the weakness of the United States' own military strength, the world's reaction to this situation," and the lessons he learned during his mission to China, he did not dare to act rashly. Acheson further presented a so-called "Memoir of American Policy toward China" of more than 400,000 words, explaining the U.S. government's consistent policy of enslaving the Chinese people through Chiang Kai-shek. He blatantly said: The purpose of the U.S. aggression against Korea is precisely "to make China fail and the United States win." As for the current policy, Marshall once publicly declared: "The established policy of the United States is not to hand over Taiwan to Communist China and to oppose Communist China's entry into the United Nations." Acheson also declared: The U.S. government "has an obligation to ensure that Taiwan does not fall into enemy hands, and has an obligation to use military force to achieve this result." Moreover, the U.S. government will "always recognize and support" the Kuomintang remnants and bandits to be enemies with the Chinese people to the end.

The military and political leaders of the Truman government revealed that their main fear in pursuing the aggression policy was the invincible Sino-Soviet alliance and the powerful force of the liberated people. In this regard, U.S. imperialism has learned some lessons. Marshall admitted: When the United States considered expanding the war to China, it "took into account the treaty signed by the Soviet Union and Communist China." Bradley admitted: When the United States launched the aggression, "no one thought that North Korea (referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) would be as strong as later events proved." White House documents released at the same time as the testimony revealed that when Truman and MacArthur held a meeting on Wake Island last October, they mistakenly concluded that the Chinese people would not aid Korea. It was not until the U.S. aggressor army was severely attacked by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies that these imperialist elements were shocked to discover that the United States had fallen into a "deadlock with heavy losses" in Korea (MacArthur). This situation forced Marshall to admit: "It is very bad for us," but what is worse for U.S. imperialism is that it will continue to develop, thereby endangering the complete destruction of the United States' aggression plan in the world. Even MacArthur had to lament that the result of the war's development would be the "increasing strength" of the world peace camp, while the imperialist camp would "always be weakening."

During the more than seven weeks of the investigation meeting, the members of the Senate Military and Foreign Affairs Committees repeatedly questioned the government leaders who attended the testimony about what methods the government had to achieve "victory." However, no government leader was able to answer this question. A typical evasion was Bradley's answer. He said that he was "not very sure" whether the "limited war" strategy pursued by the Washington command in Korea could produce "decisive results"; "All I can say is that the Chiefs of Staff do not believe that expanding the war to China and taking more risks would make it easier for us to obtain these decisive results."

In this way, the entire investigation meeting completely exposed the fact that U.S. imperialism's defeat in Korea was a foregone conclusion, and that it was at a loss as to what to do. It exposed the fact that it was fierce-looking but faint-hearted, seemingly strong but actually weak throughout the world. It was precisely because of this that the investigation meeting had to end hastily.

Republican Senate Leader Taft fully revealed the distress of U.S. imperialism when commenting on the results of the "investigation" meeting on June 23rd. He said that the investigation meeting showed that the United States "did not have any detailed plan to deal with the Korean crisis."

　　美参议院“调查会”争吵不休被迫提前结束
    充分暴露美国外强中干侵略前途绝望 
    并证明美国侵略者永远是中国人民的死敌
    【新华社八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参议院军事和外交两委员会为调查所谓“麦克阿瑟事件”而联合举行的所谓“意见听取会”，在大吵大闹地延续了七个多星期以后，已于六月二十五日结束。
    这次调查会是五月三日开始的，先后有前美国远东侵略军总司令麦克阿瑟、国防部长马歇尔、参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、陆军参谋长柯林斯、空军参谋长范顿伯、海军作战部长薛尔曼、国务卿艾奇逊、第二次大战时驻华美军司令魏德迈、前国防部长詹逊、前美国远东舰队司令白吉尔、前美国驻国民党中国大使赫尔利、前美国驻国民党中国军事顾问团团长巴大维和前美国远东战略空军司令奥多尼尔十三人出席作证，在会议上发表的证辞达二百余万字，构成了美国国会历史上空前的一次“大辩论”。美国统治集团所以不得不举行这样一个调查会，本来是想澄清一下内部由于侵朝战争失败而引起的严重争吵，并为破产了的侵略政策粉饰门面，但是七个多星期以来的调查会只是进一步在全世界人民面前证明了美帝国主义侵略力量的脆弱，侵略步骤的混乱与侵略前途的绝望，而内部争吵则继续不休。在这种情形下，参议院外交军事两委员会乃不得不在六月十八日决定减少原定出席作证人员的名单，而使会议提前休会。
    这次调查会是因为杜鲁门撤除麦克阿瑟职务直接引起的，而麦克阿瑟的撤职又是美帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜遭受惨败的直接结果。会议上的作证首先反映了这一事实。麦克阿瑟与杜鲁门政府互相推诿失败责任。麦克阿瑟企图把失败归咎于华盛顿拨不出援军和不采纳他空袭中国东北等扩大战争的建议，而杜鲁门政府的军政首脑，自马歇尔、艾奇逊以下却都为自己分辩，说美国当局确曾尽了最大力量增援美国侵朝军队，无奈还是不能取胜，同时，美国当局也确曾决定，而且甚至已经授权麦克阿瑟在实际上以空军侵袭中国，后来只是因为在侵朝军队屡战屡败的情形下，考虑到这样做下去的严重后果，才对原来的野心计划表示踌蹰。
    作证很快就转入了争辩立即在远东扩大侵略战争可能引起的利害得失问题。此后，这个问题就成了所谓“调查”的主题。所有的作证者都表明自己在扩大侵略战争的意图方面，原则上是一致的。分歧只是在于对于时机和力量的估计上。麦克阿瑟和他的支持者主张不顾一切地作孤注一掷的冒险，以图侥幸一逞。但是，这个计划却被艾奇逊称为是美国“负责的军事当局断定为在使战争早日结束方面，其效用很可怀疑的措施”。为了要辩明麦克阿瑟计划之不可为，如马歇尔、布莱德雷这样的头号战争贩子，都不得不在全世界人民面前暴露了美帝国主义外强中干的窘态。他们公开承认：美国在军事上“还没有准备好”（马歇尔），美国的“军事能力不足以进行摊牌”（布莱德雷）。而艾奇逊也表示极度害怕麦克阿瑟的“这种方针有严重的危险和其他不利之处”，特别是会“削弱和美国联合阵营的实力与决心，从而削弱美国自己的实力”。
    调查会充分地证实了不论是那一类型的美国帝国主义者，他们都从来就是，而且永远都是中国人民的死敌。作证透露，早在日本投降之初，除美国政府已以巨额的军事装备和物资以及海空运输等，积极帮助国民党匪军进攻解放区外，麦克阿瑟就曾建议过直接以美国军队进攻和消灭中国人民解放军。马歇尔也直认不讳，当他任国务卿时，曾想“由美国来控制中国”，后来只是鉴于“一般的世界形势、美国自己军事力量的薄弱、世界对这种形势的反应”以及他出使中国时所得到的教训，才没有敢轻举妄动。艾奇逊更在会上提出了一份四十多万字的所谓“美国对华政策回忆录”，说明了美国政府通过蒋介石以奴役中国人民的一贯方针。他明目张胆地说：美国侵朝的目的，正是“要使中国失败，使美国胜利”。至于目前的政策，马歇尔曾公然宣告：“美国的既定政策是不把台湾交给共产党中国、并反对共产党中国进入联合国。”艾奇逊也宣告：美国政府“有义务保证台湾不落于敌人手中，并有义务使用军事力量以达到这个结果”。而且，美国政府将“始终承认并支持”国民党残余匪帮与中国人民为敌到底。
    杜鲁门政府的军政首脑透露：他们在推行侵略政策时，主要的恐惧就是无敌的中苏同盟，是解放了的人民的强大力量。在这方面，美帝国主义已受到了一些教训。马歇尔承认：美国在考虑把战争扩大到中国的前途时，“曾考虑到苏联和共产党中国所订的条约。”布莱德雷承认：美国在发动侵略时“没有人想到北朝鲜（指朝鲜民主主义人民共和国）会像后来事实证明的那样强大”。与作证同时发表的白宫文件透露，去年十月杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟在威克岛举行会议时，曾错误地断定中国人民不会援助朝鲜。直到美国侵略军遭到中朝人民军队的痛击之后，这些帝国主义分子才大吃一惊地发现美国在朝鲜已经陷于“损失惨重的僵局”（麦克阿瑟）。这种形势，迫使马歇尔承认：“对我们是很糟的”，但对美帝国主义说来更糟的是，它还会继续发展下去，从而使美国在全世界的侵略计划有被完全破坏的危险。对于这一点，连麦克阿瑟也不得不哀鸣：战争发展的结果将是世界和平阵营的“实力日益壮大”，而帝国主义阵营则“总是在削弱”。
    在七个多星期的调查会会上，参议院军事外交两委员会的委员们曾反复向出席作证的政府首脑质问政府有什么取得“胜利”的办法。但是，对于这个问题，竟没有一个政府首脑人物能够解答。典型的遁辞是布莱德雷的答复。他说，他“不太能肯定”华盛顿统帅部在朝鲜进行的“有限战争”的作战方针能否产生“决定性的结果”；“我所能够说的是，各参谋长不认为把战争扩大到中国和冒更多的危险就会使我们更容易获得这些决定性的结果。”
    这样，整个调查会完全暴露了美帝国主义在朝鲜败局已定，进退失据的事实，暴露了它在全世界色厉内茬、外强中干的事实。正是因为如此，调查会才不得不匆匆结束。
    共和党参院领袖塔夫脱于六月二十三日在评论“调查”会的结果时充分透露了美帝国主义的苦闷。他说，调查会表明美国“没有任何应付朝鲜危机的周密的计划”。
