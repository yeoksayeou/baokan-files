Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Since the 16th to the 27th of last month, representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea have been widely conveying reports to people from all walks of life in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Xinxiang, and other places, and the audience has been extremely enthusiastic. Representatives of the Third Sub-delegation (East China Sub-delegation) and the Second Sub-delegation (Southwest Sub-delegation, including some representatives of the original Directly Subordinated Sub-delegation) who passed through Shanghai, gave 189 reports in Shanghai from the 16th to the 25th, with a total audience of 1.7 million people.

The reports by the representatives of the sub-delegations have played a significant role in raising the political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the people in various regions, and in promoting the in-depth development of the people's Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement.

After listening to the reports of the delegation, people from all walks of life in Shanghai responded enthusiastically to the movement to donate airplanes and artillery. Workers throughout the city and farmers in the suburbs have actively launched production increase competitions, striving to complete their donation plans as soon as possible. Many schools, institutions, and urban residents in Xi'an spontaneously donated 65.4 million yuan to purchase airplanes and artillery while listening to the broadcast of the welcome rally for the delegation. Representatives of the officers and soldiers of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army stationed in Nanjing immediately conveyed the reports of the delegation representatives to their units. The officers and soldiers of each unit expressed that they should learn from the patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive to improve their military skills and political level, so as to consolidate national defense and defend the motherland. Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan rushed to the city in the scorching heat to listen to the reports. After listening to the report, peasant Chen Falin took off his straw hat and gave it to the delegation representative, saying: "Please take my straw hat to the countryside to promote, calling on the people of the Central South region to increase production and donate airplanes and artillery to defeat the American aggressor devils!"

After listening to the reports of the delegation representatives, the people in various regions further deepened their concern and sense of responsibility for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Farmers in Wusong District of Shanghai proposed that in the future, they should first cultivate the land of the families of martyrs and soldiers, and then cultivate their own land. Farmers in Xingnong and Guangfu townships in the suburbs of Wuhan revised the patriotic covenants, explicitly proposing to guarantee help to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and volunteers to cultivate the land well and achieve a bumper harvest. The Tianjin Catholic Gongjiao Hospital and others decided to provide free diagnosis and treatment for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Residents of Dingjiaqiao in Nanjing specifically called the delegation representatives, asking them to tell the volunteers not to worry about their families. They said: We guarantee to take care of the parents and children of the volunteer soldiers as if we were taking care of our own parents and children.

Also reported: The entire group of 55 members of the Second Sub-delegation (Southwest Sub-delegation) of the delegation to Korea and some members of the Directly Subordinated Sub-delegation and the Seventh Sub-delegation arrived in Chongqing by plane from Hankou on June 27.

    向各地人民传达报告       
    推进抗美援朝运动深入开展
    【新华社二日讯】中国人民赴朝慰问团各分团代表，自上月十六日至二十七日，在上海、南京、武汉、西安、新乡等地向各界人民普遍进行传达报告，听众极为踊跃。第三分团（华东分团）和取道上海的第二分团（西南分团并包括原直属分团的部分代表）代表，自十六日至二十五日在上海即作了一百八十九次报告，听众共计一百七十万人。
    各分团代表的报告，对于提高各地人民的政治觉悟和爱国热情以及推进人民抗美援朝爱国运动的深入开展起了显著的作用。
    上海市各界人民在听了慰问团的报告以后，纷纷响应捐献飞机大炮运动。全市职工和郊区农民已积极行动起来进行增产竞赛运动，力求早日完成他们的捐献计划。西安市许多学校、机关、市区居民在收听欢迎慰问团大会广播时，听众当场即自动献出了六千五百四十万元购买飞机大炮。华东军区和第三野战军驻南京部队的指战员代表，在听取慰问团代表的报告后，立即在所属单位进行传达。各单位指战员都表示：要学习中国人民志愿军的爱国主义和国际主义精神，努力提高军事技术和政治水平，以巩固国防，保卫祖国。武汉市郊区农民纷纷冒盛暑赶赴市区听报告，翻身农民陈发林在听完报告后，将自己的草帽取下来送给慰问团代表说：“请你带着我这顶草帽到乡下去宣传，号召中南区老百姓增加生产，捐献飞机大炮，打倒美国侵略鬼子！”
    各地人民在听了慰问团代表的报告后，进一步加深了对于革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的关切和责任心。上海市吴淞区农民提出今后要做到首先耕好烈士家属、军人家属的地，然后再耕自己的地。武汉市郊区兴农、广福两乡农民增订爱国公约，明确提出保证帮助烈属、军属及志愿军家属种好田地，得到丰收。新乡市天主教公教医院等决定为烈属、军属免费诊治。南京丁家桥居民特地打电话给慰问团代表，请他们转告志愿军不要惦念他们的家属，他们说：我们保证要照顾志愿军指战员的父母儿女，如同照顾我们自己的父母儿女一样。
    又讯：赴朝慰问团第二分团（西南分团）全体团员及总团直属分团、第七分团部分团员一行五十五人，已于六月二十七日由汉口乘飞机抵达重庆。
