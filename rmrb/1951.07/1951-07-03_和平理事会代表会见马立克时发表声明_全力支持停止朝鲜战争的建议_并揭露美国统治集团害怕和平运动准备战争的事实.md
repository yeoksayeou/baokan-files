Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch from TASS: On June 27, the President of the Security Council, Malik, received a telegram from the President of the World Peace Council, Joliot-Curie. Joliot-Curie informed him that the World Peace Council delegation had not received visas from the United States. In the same telegram, Joliot-Curie requested the President of the Security Council to meet with the American members of the delegation: Robertson and Uphaus. Malik informed Joliot-Curie that he had received the telegram and that he would meet with the American members of the World Peace Council delegation.

On June 28, the President of the Security Council, Malik, met with members of the World Peace Council delegation, Mr. Robertson and Ms. Baorong (representing Mr. Uphaus, a member of the World Peace Council, who is currently attending the peace conference in Chicago).

Robertson handed over the letter to the United Nations adopted by the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw to the President of the Security Council.

Robertson, on behalf of the World Peace Council representing hundreds of millions of people around the world, expressed deep gratitude to the Soviet representative to the United Nations for his willingness, as President of the Security Council, to meet with the World Peace Council delegation, and pointed out that due to the illegal action of the United States government in refusing to issue US entry visas to the fourteen-member delegation of the World Peace Council, only two members of the World Peace Council residing in the United States were able to meet with the President of the Security Council.

Robertson explained the facts of the war preparations being carried out by the NATO aggressive bloc of countries led by the United States, and the fact that the United States has moved from preparing for aggression to direct acts of aggression, and then emphasized that the people of all countries are determined to thwart the aggressive conspiracies of the warmongers and prevent another world war.

Robertson said: A peaceful resolution to the Korean War as soon as possible is one of the most urgent steps to prevent a new war. We, the representatives of the World Peace Council, thank you and your government for your direct and urgent proposal to end the Korean War to the world.

Robertson concluded: Hundreds of millions of people, representing a great force for peace, wholeheartedly support the proposal to end the Korean War. If the governments of some countries have shown hesitation, the people of the world have not. We are convinced that the people's desire for peace, friendship, and cooperation will surely prevail.

Malik also received a special statement from prominent American figure Uphaus to the President of the Security Council.

In this statement, Uphaus expressed gratitude to Malik for his concern for the fate of the World Peace Council delegation and requested that the World Peace Council's proposals on peace be conveyed to all member states of the Security Council.

Upon receiving these documents, Malik said that he would do everything in his power to bring the World Peace Council's letter to the United Nations and the statements of the members of the World Peace Council delegation to the attention of all member states of the Security Council, and to have them published as official documents of the Security Council. He expressed regret that, due to the position taken by the American authorities, the World Peace Council delegation was unable to speak before the United Nations and present proposals on peace. Malik also emphasized that the noble ideal of the struggle for peace is increasingly and widely penetrating the people of all countries and all strata of society. Now, the resolute struggle of the people of all countries for peace against the instigators of a new world war is becoming increasingly important.

During the conversation, Robertson expressed the hope that the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Andiyan, would meet with the World Peace Council delegation.

Malik suggested that the members of the World Peace Council delegation write directly to the President of the General Assembly on this matter.

Baorong said to Malik: Women account for fifty percent of the population in the United States, and they constitute a great force in the struggle for peace. She cited many examples showing the willingness of American women to prevent another war and consolidate the pro-peace movement in the United States.

In response, Malik wished American progressive women victory in their activities to prevent another war and strengthen world peace.

Malik, in his capacity as the Soviet representative to the United Nations, told the delegation about the great struggle of all the Soviet people and Soviet women to consolidate peace and prevent war. Malik said: The Soviet people are dedicating all their strength to peaceful construction, to the struggle to prevent war and consolidate international friendship. The Soviet people believe that the noble aspirations of the American and Soviet people for peace will overcome the forces of war and will guarantee world peace.

Robertson told Malik about the obstacles placed by the reactionaries against the American pro-peace movement, and the fact that the American authorities obstruct the struggle for peace and cruelly persecute and retaliate against active peace advocates. Malik said: The American ruling clique is obviously very afraid of peace advocates and obviously afraid of the expansion of the peace movement. The fact that they did not allow the World Peace Council delegation to come to the United States clearly proves this. Malik said: This illustrates the difficulties and circumstances of the peace struggle in the United States. The new, brave, and noble peace struggle carried out under these special conditions has aroused the admiration of all sincere peace advocates around the world.

The representatives also said that Malik's broadcast speech proposing an end to hostilities in Korea had won widespread approval from the American people. The American people have been given another opportunity to believe that the Soviet Union wants peace and wants to cooperate with the people of all countries.

The conversation took place in a friendly atmosphere. As the representatives took their leave, they expressed their gratitude for Malik's warm reception. Malik wished the representatives success in their noble activities to strengthen peace and prevent another war.

　　和平理事会代表会见马立克时发表声明
    全力支持停止朝鲜战争的建议
    并揭露美国统治集团害怕和平运动准备战争的事实
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：六月二十七日，安全理事会主席马立克接到世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的电报一封。约里奥—居里通知他：世界和平理事会代表团没有得到美国的签证。在同一封电报中，约里奥—居里要求安全理事会主席接见该代表团在美国的团员：罗伯逊和乌法斯。马立克通知约里奥—居里表示已经收到这封电报，并说：他将接见在美国的世界和平理事会代表团团员。
    六月二十八日，安全理事会主席马立克接见了世界和平理事会代表团团员罗伯逊先生和巴奥朗女士（她代表现在芝加哥参加和平大会的世界和平理事会理事乌法斯先生）。
    罗伯逊把华沙第二届世界和平大会所通过的致联合国书递交安全理事会主席。
    罗伯逊以代表世界千百万人民的世界和平理事会的名义发表声明，对苏联驻联合国代表愿意以安全理事会主席身份接见世界和平理事会代表团一事表示深切的感激之意，并指出：由于美国政府拒绝把美国入境签证发给世界和平理事会十四人代表团的非法行动，只有两个住在美国的世界和平理事会理事有可能会见了安全理事会主席。
    罗伯逊说明了以美国为首的北大西洋侵略集团各国进行的战争准备以及美国从准备侵略进到直接侵略行动的事实，然后又强调指出：世界各国人民决心挫败战争贩子的侵略阴谋，并防止另一次世界大战。
    罗伯逊说：尽早和平解决朝鲜战争，是防止新战争的最紧迫的步骤之一。我们世界和平理事会代表感谢你和你的政府，因为你们向全世界提出了关于停止朝鲜战争的直接而迫切的建议。
    罗伯逊最后说：代表着伟大的和平力量的千百万人民，全心支持停止朝鲜战争的建议。如果说若干国家政府表现了迟疑不决，那么，全世界人民是没有这种表现的，我们深信人民要求和平、友好、合作的愿望一定会胜利。
    马立克并接到了美国著名人物乌法斯递交安全理事会主席的特别声明。
    在这篇声明中，乌法斯对马立克关怀世界和平理事会代表团的命运一举表示感激，并请求把世界和平理事会关于和平问题的建议转告安全理事会所有的理事国。
    在接受这些文件时，马立克说，他将尽一切力量使世界和平理事会致联合国书和世界和平理事会代表团团员们的声明受到安全理事会所有理事国的注意，并且作为安全理事会的正式文件予以发表。他表示，由于美国当局采取的立场，世界和平理事会代表团未能在联合国组织面前发言，并提出关于和平问题的建议，他很感遗憾。马立克并且强调指出：和平斗争的崇高理想，正日益广泛地深入到世界各国各阶层人民中。现在，各国人民争取和平反对新世界战争挑拨者的坚决斗争，正日益重要。
    在这次谈话中，罗伯逊表示，希望联合国大会主席安迪让接见世界和平理事会代表。
    马立克建议世界和平理事会代表团团员直接就这个问题致函大会主席。
    巴奥朗对马立克说：在美国人口中，妇女占百分之五十，她们在和平斗争中构成一支伟大的力量。她援引了许多事例，显示美国妇女愿意阻止另一次战争和巩固美国国内的拥护和平运动。
    马立克在回答时，祝美国进步妇女在她们阻止另一次战争和加强世界和平的活动中获得胜利。
    马立克以苏联驻联合国代表的身份，把全苏人民和苏联妇女为了巩固和平、阻止战争所进行的伟大斗争的情形告诉代表团。马立克说：苏联人民献出他们的全部力量从事和平建设，从事阻止战争与巩固国际友谊的斗争。苏联人民相信，美国和苏联人民争取和平的崇高志愿将战胜战争力量，并将保证世界和平。
    罗伯逊把反动派对美国拥护和平运动所加的阻碍，以及美国当局阻挠和平斗争并残酷地迫害、报复积极的和平拥护者的情形告诉马立克。马立克说：美国统治集团显然非常害怕和平拥护者，显然害怕和平运动的扩大。他们不允许世界和平理事会代表团到美国来这个事实，清楚地证明了这一点。马立克说：这说明了美国和平斗争的困难和处境。在这些特殊的条件下进行的新的、勇敢的、崇高的和平斗争，引起了全世界所有真诚的和平拥护者的敬佩。
    代表们也说到，提出了结束朝鲜敌对行动的建议的马立克的广播演说博得了美国人民普遍的赞许。美国人民又得到一个机会相信苏联希望和平，希望与各国人民合作。
    谈话是在友好的空气中进行的。代表们在告辞时，对马立克热情的接见表示感谢。马立克祝代表们在为了加强和平、阻止另一次战争的崇高活动中获得胜利。
