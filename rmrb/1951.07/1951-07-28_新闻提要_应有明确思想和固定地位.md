  　"News Highlights" Should Have a Clear Ideology and Fixed Position
Editor:
    The purpose of publishing "News Highlights" in newspapers is to help readers understand the important news of the day. Therefore, I think the People's Daily's practice of fixing "News Highlights" in the upper right corner of the newspaper is relatively good. However, some newspapers have shortcomings in handling "News Highlights": the position is not fixed, nor is it prominent. For example, the Shanghai Liberation Daily sometimes publishes "News Highlights" in the upper left corner of the front page, and sometimes in the lower right corner of the front page; today it is published on the right side of the masthead, but tomorrow it is published on the left side. Another example is the "News Highlights" of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, which is not only not prominent in its position, but also does not indicate which edition it is. The disadvantage of this approach is that it not only does not easily attract the reader's attention, but also increases the reader's trouble in searching for "News Highlights."
    Some newspapers do not have "News Highlights" at all. Therefore, I suggest that newspapers that do not publish "News Highlights" should add this item as much as possible; those that have "News Highlights" should fix the position, preferably in the upper right or upper left corner of the first page of the newspaper. As for the text of the highlights, it should be concise, eye-catching, and clear.

### “新闻提要”应有明确思想和固定地位

  　“新闻提要”应有明确思想和固定地位编辑同志：
    报纸刊登《新闻提要》的目的，是在帮助读者了解每天的重要新闻。因而，人民日报把《新闻提要》固定在报纸右上角的作法，我认为是比较好的。但某些报纸在处理《新闻提要》上，是有缺点的：地位不固定，也不显著。如上海解放日报有时把《新闻提要》登在一版左上角，有时又登在一版右下角；今天登在报头右面，明天却又登在左面。又如上海大公报的《新闻提要》，不但地位不显著，就连那一版也不注明。这种做法的缺点是，不仅不易引起读者注意，反使读者为找寻《新闻提要》而增加了麻烦。
    还有一些报纸，根本没有《新闻提要》。因此，我建议没有刊登《新闻提要》的报纸，应尽可能增设这一项；有了《新闻提要》的，应固定地位，最好刊登在报纸第一版的右上角，或左上角。至于提要的文字，应该是简洁醒目、明确的。
