　　National Wheat Production Increases by Approximately Ten Percent Compared to Last Year
　  Hebei Farmers Display High Patriotic Enthusiasm, Quickly Completing Summer Grain Quotas
    The wheat harvest, which began in mid-May in various regions, concluded entirely by the end of June. According to preliminary statistics, production increased by about ten percent compared to 1950; moreover, the wheat kernels are full and the quality is excellent, much better than last year.

    The best harvest this year was in the East China region, where the total harvest of barley and wheat increased by thirty percent compared to last year. In particular, northern Anhui, which used to suffer from disasters every year, has seen a bumper wheat harvest this year, with production more than doubling compared to last year. This is because the spring rains in the Huai River basin were not particularly heavy this year, and the Central People's Government has begun the great project of fundamentally controlling the Huai River. Last year, the State Council decided that the Huai River project would guarantee the wheat harvest in the spring of 1951, and the expected results have now been achieved.

    Another particularly noteworthy achievement in this year's wheat production is that the yield per unit area has increased in some regions. Henan's average yield per mu increased by 20% compared to last year, and Shaanxi's average yield per mu reached 193 jin, an increase of 32 jin compared to last year, exceeding the pre-war peak record of 189 jin per mu. The Guanzhong area has even higher yields, averaging 221 jin per mu.

    The harvest this year was not as good as last year in North China and Southwest China. The southwest suffered from spring drought, resulting in low yields. North China experienced drought followed by flooding last autumn, which delayed planting. This year, it was also affected by spring drought, and the cotton fields were expanded while the wheat fields were slightly reduced. Therefore, both the total output and the yield per unit area in North China this year were lower than last year.

    The summer grain requisition work in Hebei Province has been successfully completed. Currently, the amount of public grain that has been put into storage in the province has reached 89.69% of the total grain requisition target.

    During this summer requisition, the farmers of Hebei Province demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, delivering high-quality wheat quickly. Wu'an County in Hengshui Prefecture designated July 2nd as a Patriotic Grain Delivery Day, and the entire county completed its grain delivery in a single day. Many farmers in Wu'an and other counties, in addition to delivering the required public grain, voluntarily contributed additional grain as donations to the country. According to statistics from Wu'an County alone, farmers contributed an additional 300,000 jin of public grain.

    Good preparation for the summer requisition was another reason for its rapid completion. Many counties in Hebei registered wheat fields when planting wheat last year. During spring plowing and cotton planting and wheat harvesting, the number of mu of wheat fields was meticulously recorded. During the summer requisition, various localities used self-reporting and mutual evaluation methods to verify the number of mu of wheat fields and their yields. Therefore, Hebei implemented the principle of tax calculation based on rate during this summer requisition.

### 全国麦子产量较去年增加约百分之十  河北农民发挥高度爱国热情很快缴完夏季公粮

　　全国麦子产量较去年增加约百分之十
　  河北农民发挥高度爱国热情很快缴完夏季公粮
    各地麦收自五月中旬开始，已于六月底全部结束。据初步统计，产量较一九五○年增产百分之十左右；而且麦粒饱满，品质优良，比去年好得多。
    今年收成最好的是华东区，大麦小麦的总收获量比去年增产百分之三十。特别是过去年年发生灾害的皖北，今年小麦已告丰收，比去年增产二倍以上。这是因为今年淮河流域春雨不十分大，中央人民政府又开始进行了根治淮河的伟大工程之故。去年政务院决定治淮工程在一九五一年春季便要保证麦收，现在已经收到了预期的效果。
    今年麦子生产中特别值得注意的另一个成就是有些地区单位面积的产量已有所增加。河南每亩平均比去年增产二成，陕西每亩平均产量达一九三斤，比去年增加三十二斤，已超过战前每亩平均一八九斤的最高纪录。关中地区产量更高，平均每亩达二二一斤。
    今年收成不如去年的是华北和西南。西南因春旱以致产量不高。华北去年秋季先旱后涝，播种失时，今年又受春旱，加以棉田扩大，麦田略有减少，因此今年华北区的总产量和单位面积产量都比去年低。

    河北省夏季征收公粮的工作已顺利完成，现在，全省入了库的公粮已达公粮征起数的百分之八十九点六九。
    这次夏缴中，河北省的农民表现了高度的爱国热情，缴的小麦很好，而且缴的很快。衡水专区武邑县这次定七月二日为爱国缴粮日，全县在二日一天中即完成了缴粮。武安等县很多农民，在缴够应征的公粮之外，纷纷多缴粮食作为对国家的捐献。据武安一县的统计，农民多缴的公粮达三十万斤。
    夏征准备工作作得好，是这次迅速完成夏征的另一个原因。河北很多县份，在去年种麦时，就曾登记麦田。各地在春耕种棉时和收麦时，都曾详细统计麦田亩数。夏征中间，各地又以自报互评的方法，查实了麦田的亩数和产量。因而河北在这次夏征工作中，贯彻了依率计征的方针。
