　　Starting with the China Acrobatic Troupe
    Ding Li
  I
    The China Acrobatic Troupe was warmly welcomed and highly praised during its performances in the Soviet Union and Poland; audiences expressed their infinite love for the acrobatic arts of our great motherland, a tradition with a long history!
    The China Acrobatic Troupe not only introduced the skills of the Chinese people to foreign countries, but also allowed the people of the Soviet Union and Poland to see the inherent qualities of the Chinese people through the performances of these skills. Therefore, its influence is not limited to the acrobatic arts themselves.
    Major newspapers and magazines in the Soviet Union and Poland have published articles stating that Chinese acrobatic art is an art with national characteristics and national flavor, an original art. They said that in the performances, the actors' optimistic, energetic, and creative spirit represents the characteristics of the Chinese people—hardworking, brave, strong, and determined to achieve their goals. These characteristics are the excellent traditions of the Chinese people for thousands of years. This traditional spirit is concentrated and generalized in acrobatic art, giving the audience a very vivid and strong impression.
  II
    What are the beautiful characteristics and attractive charms of Chinese acrobatics? I think it is necessary to re-evaluate and study it.
    First of all, from a holistic and fundamental point of view, because Chinese acrobatic art is a folk art with a long history and tradition, it expresses distinct national characteristics and style. It grows and thrives deeply from the soil of China, containing strong Chinese customs, national temperament, and inheriting the ancient traditional methods of physical exercise for practicing martial arts, thus producing a set of completely different skills, movements, and patterns. Therefore, it can radiate a brand-new and magnificent brilliance on the international circus stage! Imagine, if you were to create a set of "foreign tricks" (the old name for acrobatics was "Hundred Plays," and "tricks" is a general term for "Hundred Plays"), the result would be unimaginable! This national style and characteristics are precious and indispensable. It should be inherited and carried forward! Otherwise, how can it be called the art of the people?
    Looking further, I think it has the following characteristics:
    At a symposium convened by the Polish Association for Foreign Culture in Warsaw, a Polish reporter raised a very interesting question. He asked: "Italian circus performers are best at and most characteristic in throwing things (referring to throwing plates, hoops, balls, sticks, etc.). What about Chinese actors? What skills make Chinese actors perform so well?" After quickly thinking through our program, I grasped an essential characteristic. I replied that the decisive condition for Chinese actors to skillfully perform certain techniques is good physical training, which enables them to perform many difficult patterns. I told him that Zhu Youcheng, a thirteen-year-old actor who performs martial arts, has had seven years of training, and Guan Yuhe has been performing hoop diving for nearly fifty years (they expressed great surprise!). Other programs such as plate spinning, head-balancing bowls, vehicle skills, pole climbing, and diabolo... without good physical training, it would be difficult to achieve such results! After further consideration, I felt that this statement was completely correct. Some Soviet circus performers praised this point during performances in the Soviet Union. They felt that our actors' skills were very solid, and even felt that with such physical training, we would definitely be able to create more ingenious patterns. Because of good physical training, as the Soviet actors felt, our actors' movements are exquisite, accurate, beautiful, soft, and appropriate. I think to reach this level, not only must physical fitness be well-trained, but there must also be "surplus power"! Otherwise, it is difficult to evoke the audience's aesthetic sense! - Hoarse shouts are certainly not singing, and if people look strenuous and always feel like he is going to fail, then what kind of skill is that? I think this is probably a fundamental condition for being worthy of the name of art and beauty. Our good acrobats have this ability. For example, the vehicle skills of the Jin Yeqin, Jin Ruqin, and Jin Shuqin siblings; the jar performance of He Shuwang, etc., make people see many difficult patterns and make people feel that they perform calmly, as if they don't know what difficulty is..., which can be said to have reached a state of perfection.
    Another characteristic is that most of our programs are beautiful, exquisite, and meticulous. Just like a famous Soviet People's Artist told me after watching the performance: he was very happy after watching our exquisite performance, and he said that his impression of watching acrobatics had completely merged with his impression of seeing Chinese paintings. He had just seen the Chinese Art Exhibition held at about the same time when we were performing in Moscow. In addition to supplementing the national characteristics of our acrobatics, it can be imagined that he has found the internal factors that connect Chinese painting and acrobatics. Looking at the programs, He Shuwang's jar performance, Wang Kuiying's diabolo, Cheng Xiaolin and Cheng Shaolin's head-balancing bowls, and the Jin Yeqin siblings' vehicle skills, etc., belong to this nature. These are all the results of skill, showing the wisdom of the people and the results of long-term operation. The Soviet "Literary Gazette" had an article titled "Actors of New China," which, while deeply admiring He Shuwang's jar performance, added this description: "Among all the traditional programs of the acrobatic troupe, the most outstanding is He Shuwang's jar juggling. He holds a huge and heavy jar in his hand, throws it into the air, and it falls lightly on his head, the bridge of his nose, or it spins rapidly downwards with the bottom facing the sky, using the small edge of the jar to rotate on the actor's forehead... This program has won the greatest welcome from the audience." Zoya Kokh, a famous Soviet circus actress and Honored Artist of the Russian Republic, wrote this about He Shuwang's jar juggling in the "Soviet Art Newspaper" article "Excellent Technique": "We have repeatedly seen advanced juggling in the circus, like the balls and sticks that are usually juggled, but we have never seen very heavy and large flower pots being juggled, and He Shuwang performed it with an unparalleled skill. This program is unique. I have never encountered such complete and flawless skills as He Shuwang's when performing in circuses in Paris, Berlin, Barcelona, Hamburg, and other Western European cities. The confidence of this talented actor is noteworthy. When he performs, it is difficult to find that he has any difficulties. He throws flower pots weighing several kilograms into the air, or balances them on his head, as if he were playing with a small leather ball." It is by no means accidental that it has won such praise, constantly winning the audience's indescribable surprise and heartfelt admiration in the performance, as well as sudden bursts of storm-like applause! Intelligence and wisdom have enabled them to create unbelievable patterns, and decades of long-term labor have enabled their operations to reach an extremely refined, pure, graceful, and elegant level, thus giving people the greatest aesthetic sense and pleasure.
    Another important characteristic, which is also a significant difference from foreign circuses, is that from most of our programs, we can see that it is full of an internal force, showing a unique character! The enthusiasm, courage, perseverance, optimism, and vivid power it possesses are not completely expressed externally and sharply, but are deeply infused within the form. At first glance, it seems difficult to see those excellent qualities, and it seems ordinary; but in essence, the most fascinating thing is that the infinite power that is good at hiding but not revealing, seemingly absent but actually existing, dominates everything! It seems a bit mysterious to say this, but it is not difficult to find an answer from the Chinese martial arts tradition. If a person's cultivation and training reach the apex of cultivation, as the old saying goes, "great strength is like gentleness" and "great wisdom is like foolishness," then it is by no means comparable to a "half-baked" person. There may be something in common in the skills themselves.
    This does not mean that we can stop advocating for exciting and moving performances. Hasn't it already been shown in "Great Martial Arts," "Vehicle Skills," and "Pole Climbing"? But exciting and moving effects are also produced in other programs, but it does not rely too much on external excitement. In many programs, isn't the perseverance, strength, bravery, and optimism of the people enthusiastically expressed? I think such a characteristic just shows that our acrobatics are a reflection of the simple and grand nature of the people, and therefore it has a unique spirit, demeanor, and character.
  III
    This does not mean that Chinese skills are perfect. From a general point of view, this is by no means the case. Taking the acrobatic troupe itself as an example, not all programs have reached maturity. Therefore, greater efforts are needed to strive for a more brilliant future.
    After watching many famous circus performances in the Soviet Union, after our actors came into contact with high-level and well-organized circus art, it opened up an extraordinarily broad creative path for our actors and gave our actors a huge influence! Thus, the most important common hopes and beliefs were generated: they eagerly hope that the government will establish a national circus troupe; they are determined to dedicate themselves to the construction of the new Chinese circus art; they are determined to serve the people and strive to be the artists of the people. Our actors were inspired and attracted by the brilliant achievements of Soviet circus art. They eagerly and even impatiently turned their full enthusiasm to our country, hoping that a brand-new look will appear in the near future. Such a sincere spirit full of construction enthusiasm is inspiring. I remember after watching the circus performed for us at the Tbilisi Circus in the capital of Georgia, I asked Jin Yeqin what he thought of the vehicle skills performed by Peter Mayatsky, an Honored Artist of Russia. After a while, he said heavily: "This (referring to riding a motorcycle and spinning in a huge net-like sphere) is not difficult to practice; but, if you ask me to prepare this set of things, I can't do it in my whole life!" After finishing speaking, he fell silent again! What he was considering and what he was hoping for can be imagined. There are many actors who have such feelings.
    From conversations with the actors, most of the actors expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the country, because they have deeply realized that the Soviet Union is a model for the new China, and the new China will also embark on the road of great construction. They understand that greater development can only be achieved by relying on the strength of the country! They understand that it is difficult to make great strides forward and use scientific methods to research and create without ending the past "street performances," "going to gardens," and "running docks" in groups. Otherwise, they can only make a living by selling the skills passed down from their father or master!
    Naturally, such hopes and demands are justified and are a manifestation of improved political awareness! It is the spirit of entrepreneurs who are eager to make progress! The ideals and hopes that could never be realized in the past have become possible today! Due to the emergence of the new China and the rapid progress of national construction, the construction of the new Chinese circus art has also had the conditions for new development.
    The development of all people's circuses gradually tends to establish urban organized circuses from various scattered market performances; and Soviet circus art was able to flourish under the leadership of the country after the success of the October Revolution, when Lenin issued a decree that "circuses belong to the state."
    Various new conditions will not and cannot be fully prepared and universally constructed all at once, which requires constant hard work. We cannot have such a grand scale in three to five years as the construction of Soviet circus art for thirty-three years. But in the skill itself, after the generations of skilled artisans of our people have passed it on and accumulated it richly, we have already established a solid and beautiful foundation. If we can absorb experienced veteran artisans, playwrights, musicians, artists, sports experts,..., and excellent actors to jointly study and create, refine some programs, arrange them, beautify them, enhance their political nature, and improve the cultural level and artistic accomplishment of the actors, then acrobatics will have a new look. Then, organizing martial arts, sports (soft performance, decisive power, weightlifting, wrestling,..., etc.), equestrianism, animal acts, magic,..., and turning crosstalk into political satire programs, so that comedians can become the active core that runs through the entire program, can form a circus. - All of these technicians are available. It is possible and necessary to first organize a touring circus.
    The people's skills of our great motherland, which have already gained international fame, will unfold a brand-new look, and will be compatible with the majestic and magnificent posture of our great people!

　　从中华杂技团谈起
    丁里
  一
    中华杂技团，在苏联和波兰上演时受到了热烈的欢迎，得到了很高的评价；观众们对于我们伟大祖国的具有悠久历史传统的中国人民的杂技艺术表示了无限的喜爱！
    中华杂技团不仅是向国外介绍了中国人民的技艺、并且使苏、波人民透过技艺的表演而从某种程度上也可以看到中国人民固有的特质，因之它的影响也就不仅限于杂技艺术的本身。
    苏联和波兰各大报纸和刊物都发表了文章，认为中国的杂技艺术是具有民族特色和民族风味的艺术，是独创一格的艺术。他们说在表演里，演员们乐观主义的生气勃勃的创造精神，代表着中国人民性格的特点——勤劳、勇敢、坚强、不达到目的不止的决心。这些特点，是中国人民数千年来的优秀传统。这个传统精神在杂技艺术中集中而概括地表现出来，给了观众以极鲜明强烈的印象。
  二
    中国的杂技究竟具备了哪些优美的特点和诱人的魅力呢？我认为，对它作新的估价和研究是必要的。
    首先，也是从整体上、根本上来看，由于中国杂技艺术是具有悠久历史传统的人民技艺，因此，它就表现了鲜明的民族色彩与风格。它是从中国的土壤上根深叶茂地生长壮大起来，它包含着强烈的中国人民的风俗习惯、民族的气质，继承了古老传统练功习武的肢体锻炼的方法，因而产生了一套迥乎不同的技巧、动作，与花样。因此，在国际的马戏场上才能焕发了崭新的、绚烂的光彩！假定你设想一下，如果搞了一套“洋把戏”（杂技的老名叫“百戏”，而“把戏”即“百戏”的通称），那结果将不堪想象了！这民族的风格与特色，是可贵的，非如此不可的，应该继承它而加以发扬光大！否则，那还称得起什么人民的技艺呢？
    进一步来看，我觉得它有这样几个特点：
    在华沙波兰对外文化协会召集的座谈会上，一位波兰记者提出了一个很有兴味的问题，他问道：“意大利的马戏演员最擅长、最有特色的技术是扔东西，（指的是扔盘子，圈子、球、棒之类）那么中国演员呢？是什么技巧使中国演员表演得那么好呢？”当我很快地把我们的节目想了一遍之后，我抓到了一个非有不可的特点，我回答他说：中国演员之所以能熟练地表演某种技术的决定的条件，就是有良好的体能锻炼，因此才能使他们表演出许多不容易表演的花样。我告诉他表演武术的十三岁的小演员朱友诚已经有七年的锻炼，而关玉和表演钻圈已将近五十年了，（他们表示了很大的惊异！）其他节目如耍盘子、头顶碗塔、车技、杠子、幌板……如果没有良好的身体锻炼，那是难以有这样的成绩的！事后我又加以考虑，我觉得这样说法是完全对的。在苏联表演时，一些苏联马戏演员很称赞这一点。他们感到我们的演员的功夫很结实，甚至觉得我们既有这样的体能锻炼，定能创造出更多的巧妙的花样来。由于体能锻炼得好，正如苏联演员所感到的那样，我们演员的动作是精致的、准确的、美丽的、柔软的、合度的。我想能达到这种程度，不仅体能要锻炼得好，并且非要有“余力”不可！否则是难以引起观众的美感的！——力竭声嘶的大吼大嚎固然算不得什么歌唱，如果使人看了吃力不堪、老觉得他要砸锅似的，那还算得了什么技艺呢？我想这大概就是能够称得起艺术、称得起美的一个根本的条件吧。我们好的杂技演员就是具备了这样的能力的。如像金业勤、金汝勤、金淑勤兄妹的车技；佫树旺的坛子等节目就是使人看了许多难以表演的花样而使人感到他们表演得从容不迫，像是不知道什么叫困难似的………，这可以说已达到炉火纯青的境地了。
    再一个特点就是我们节目的性质大多是优美的、精巧的、细致的。正像一位有名的苏联人民演员看完了表演之后所对我表示的：他看完了我们的精致的表演后很愉快，他说他看杂技的印象已经同看了中国画的印象完全融合一致了。我们在莫斯科上演时，他刚看了差不多同时举行的中国艺术展览会。他这意见除了补充说明了我们的杂技的民族特色之外，那么可以想见他已找到把中国画与杂技相联系的内在的因素了。从节目当中来看吧，佫树旺的坛子，王葵英的空竹，程小林、程少林的头顶碗塔以及金业勤兄妹的车技等节目，就是属于这样的性质的。这都是熟能生巧的，表现了人民的才智与长期操作的结果。苏联《文学报》曾有一篇题为《新中国的演员》的文章，对佫树旺的坛子在深表赞叹之余并加以这样的描写：“在全部杂技团这些传统的节目中，最卓越的是佫树旺的耍坛子，他手里拿着巨大而沉重的坛子，将它抛在空中，它就忽而轻巧的落在头上、鼻梁上，忽而底朝天的急旋而下，用坛子的小小的一点边沿点在演员的额角上旋转着……这个节目获得了观众最大的欢迎。”苏联享有盛名的马戏女演员——俄罗斯共和国功勋演员佐雅·高赫在“苏维埃艺术报”上发表的“优秀的技术”一文中对佫树旺的坛子是这样写的：“我们在马戏场里屡次看见过高级的耍东西，像平常所耍的球和棒，但是我们从未看见过玩耍很重、很大的花坛，而佫树旺以一种无可比拟的技巧表演了它。这个节目是无双的，我在巴黎、柏林、巴塞隆纳、汉堡以及其他的西欧城市马戏院表演时，也没碰见过像佫树旺的技艺这样完整无缺。这个天才演员的信心是值得注意的。在他表演时，是难以发现他有什么困难的。他把好几公斤重的花坛子甩向空中，或用头顶，就像在玩一个小皮球。”它之所以获得这样的赞扬，在表演场上不时地赢得观众们发出一片难以描摹的惊喜而衷心赞赏的音浪和突然暴发的暴风雨似的掌声，是绝非偶然的！聪明与智慧使他们创造了令人难以相信的花样，几十年的长期的劳动使他们的操作达到了极为精致、纯熟、线条优美、幽雅动人的程度，因此，给人以最大的美感与愉悦。
    还有一个重要的特点，也是与外国的马戏有着显著的区别的，就是从我们的大部分节目的本身，可以看到它是充满了一种内在的力量，表现了一种特有的性格！它所具有的热情、勇敢、坚毅、乐观与生动的力量，并不是完全表现于外部的、锋芒毕露的，而是深深的贯注于形体之内的。初看来似乎难以看到那些优美的素质，也似乎是平凡无奇；但实质上，最令人神往的所在，就在于善藏不露，似无而实有的那种贯入毫发的无限的力量在主导着一切！这样说起来似乎有些玄妙了，但从中国的国术传统来看也不难得到解答。人的修养锻炼若达到像老话所讲的“大刚若柔”、“大智若愚”的修养的顶点，那就绝非“半瓶醋”所可比拟了。在技艺的本身也许有其共通之处吧。
    这并不是说我们就可以不提倡紧张动人的表演，在“大武术”、“车技”、“杠子”里不是已经表现了吗？但在其他的节目中也同样产生了紧张动人的效果，不过它不是过多的借助于外形的激动而已。在许多节目里不也是热情奔放地表现了人民的坚毅、刚强、英勇与乐观主义的精神么？我想，这样的特点正说明了我们的杂技是浑厚、宏大的人民性质的反映，因之它也就具有了特有的气魄、风度与性格。
  三
    这并不等于说，中国的技艺已经完美无缺了。从一般的情况看来，还绝非如此。就以杂技团本身来说，也并非所有节目都已达到成熟。因此，还需付出更大的努力才可以争取到更光辉的前途。
    在看了苏联许多有名的马戏表演，演员们与高级的组织完备的马戏艺术接触之后，就给我们的演员们打开了一条异常广阔地创造的道路，给了我们演员以巨大的影响！因而产生了最重要的共同的希望与信念：他们热望政府建立国家马戏团；决心献身于新中国马戏艺术的建设；坚决为人民服务，争取做人民的技艺家。我们的演员被苏联马戏艺术的辉煌的成就所鼓舞、所吸引，他们热切地、甚至急不可待地把满腔热望转向我们的国家，希望在不久的将来会出现一个全新的面貌。这样真挚的充满了建设热情的精神，是令人感奋的。记得在格鲁其亚的首都梯比利西马戏院刚看完了为我们表演的马戏之后，我就问金业勤，看他对刚刚由俄罗斯功勋演员彼得·玛雅茨基所表演的车技的观感如何。稍停之后，他沉重地说：“这个，（指的是脚踏摩托车在一巨大的网状的球体内旋转表演。）练起来并不难；可是，你要叫我置备这一套东西，那我一辈子也办不到！”说完之后他就又沉默了！他所考虑的是什么，所希望的是什么，是可以想象的。有他这样感触的演员是很多的。
    从与演员们的谈话中，绝大部分演员表示志愿献身于国家，因为他们已深切的体会到苏联便是新中国的榜样，而新中国亦必将走向伟大建设的道路，他们理解到一定要依靠国家的力量，才能有更大的发展！他们理解到要不结束过去的“撂地摊”、“赶园子”、结伙搭伴的“跑码头”，是难以有什么大步前进，和运用科学方法研究、创造的可能的。要么只能是把从父亲或师傅传授来的一套功夫，卖艺糊口而已！
    自然，这样的希望与要求是正当的，是一种政治觉悟提高的表现！是渴求进步的事业家的精神！在过去所永不能实现的理想与希望，今天已成为可能了！由于新中国的产生，国家建设的一日千里的进步，新中国的马戏艺术的建设也就有了向新的发展的条件了。
    一切人民马戏的发展都是从各种散乱的市场上的表演，逐渐趋向于建立城市的有组织的马戏团的；而苏联的马戏艺术是在十月革命成功由列宁手令“马戏院归国家所有”之后，在国家领导之下，才得以蓬勃发展的。
    各种新的条件是不会也不可能一下子齐备与普遍建设起来的，这需要不断的辛勤的努力。苏联三十三年的马戏艺术的建设，我们当然不可能在三五年内就具有那样宏大的规模的。但是在技艺的本身，经过了我们人民的技艺家的历代相传与丰富的积累，使我们已经建立了雄厚美好的基础。如果能吸收有经验的老技艺家、戏剧家、音乐家、美术家、体育家，………与优秀的演员共同研究创造，把一些节目加以提炼，加以编排，加以美化；增强其政治性，并提高演员的文化水平与艺术素养，那么杂技就会出现一个新的面貌。那么，把国术、体育（柔软表演、决力、举重、摔角………等）、马术、兽戏、魔术………组织进来；再把相声变为有政治性的讽刺节目，使滑稽演员能成为贯串全部节目的活跃的核心，便可以组成一个马戏团了。——这一切的技术家是有的，先组织一个巡回表演的马戏团是可能的、必要的。
    我们伟大祖国的已经获得国际声誉的人民技艺将展开一个全新的面貌，而与我们伟大人民的雄伟壮丽的英姿相适应！
