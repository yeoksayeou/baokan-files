The Central South Military and Political Committee instructed local People's Governments to comprehensively inspect preferential treatment work in the month before and after the "August 1st" Army Day. In cities, the focus is on inspecting the situation of helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel with production and employment; in rural areas, inspecting the situation of cultivation on their behalf. The Central South Military and Political Committee also dispatched a working group to Hunan on the 23rd to investigate the situation of preferential treatment work.

The people of Changsha and Hengyang cities in Hunan Province are further developing the movement to increase production and donations in the reports of the returning representatives of the volunteers to greet the great "August 1st" Army Day. Peng Dehuai's hometown—Wushi Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—held a people's representative meeting on the 20th of this month and established a preparatory committee for the commemoration of "August 1st". A warm celebration will be held at that time. Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi and other places have organized visiting groups, which will go to the old revolutionary base areas of the Second Revolutionary Civil War in their respective provinces around "August 1st" to express their condolences and comfort to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel.
The Hainan Administrative Office issued instructions, ordering governments at all levels to conduct a general inspection of the implementation of the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Revolutionary Military Personnel" around the "August 1st" Army Day. The instruction requires governments at all levels to first conduct inspections from top to bottom to see whether leading organs and cadres at all levels regard preferential treatment work as a regular task. The Administrative Office also dispatched two preferential treatment work inspection teams to Qiongshan County for inspection.
The East China Military and Political Committee has issued the "Decision on Conducting a General Inspection of Preferential Treatment and Medical Work on 'August 1st' Army Day." The decision stipulates: 1. Around the "August 1st" Army Day, the People's Governments of each province (region) should be responsible for initiating a visiting group composed of Party, government, and military organs, people's organizations, and democratic figures, and go to various places under their jurisdiction (mainly old liberated areas and areas with more families of martyrs and military personnel) with a focus, to visit families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled revolutionary soldiers and to express condolences to the wounded and sick, as well as systematically inspect preferential treatment and medical work once. 2. On August 1st, all levels of People's Governments in the region, in addition to being responsible for cooperating with the local garrison to hold celebrations, should also send cadres to go deep into the countryside, hospitals, and disabled soldiers' schools to hold representative meetings or general symposiums for families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled soldiers, express sincere condolences to them, and conduct in-depth patriotic education among them in light of the current situation, and at the same time understand their thoughts, emotions, and requirements, and should mobilize the masses to effectively improve their living and working conditions under possible conditions. 3. In order to commemorate the immortal achievements of revolutionary martyrs, it is decided to build martyrs' memorial towers in large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Bengbu, Xuzhou, Qingdao, Huaiyin, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, and other places with important commemorative significance. 4.
