After seeing them, we feel that our motherland is so great and so lovely."

    After listening to the work reports of the two delegations, Peng Cheng, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, said: In addition to signing contracts with Shanghai, Hangzhou, and the Central South region, Beijing has also successively signed contracts and agreements for material exchanges worth 120 billion yuan with Pingyuan, Suiyuan, and other regions. This is a very gratifying thing for the Beijing business community. He called on the city's business community not to be satisfied with the signing of contracts. He said: The signing of contracts is only the beginning of the work. In the future, we must strive to prevent the purely profit-oriented view, and strive to improve the quantity and quality of products, and ensure the thorough implementation of contracts and agreements.

　　北京工商界访问团
　  和上海等地订合同
　  大量交流各地土产
    北京市工商界派赴上海和中南区的工商访问团已相继返京，二十一日向全市各行业一千多代表报告工作。
    北京市两个工商访问团在访问期间，曾和上海、中南各地订立了五百七十五亿元的贸易合同及协议。根据这些合同和协议，北京的粉丝、栗子、果脯、西药、特种手工艺等产品将大量运销江南；云南的火腿、福建的漆器和橘子、浙江的雨伞和绍兴酒、江西的瓷器、广西的木材等，将大批供应北京市场需要。
    访问团曾经和各地工商界人士交流了城乡贸易与改进生产的经验。北京市工商局副局长、上海访问团团长张锦城在报告中着重介绍了上海工商界的先进经验。
    访问期间，访问团的代表们还参观了各地的土特产展览会。上海访问团副团长浦洁修和中南访问团副团长乐朴孙报告各地土特产展览会的情形说：“各地富饶的物产，简直取之不尽，用之不竭，看了以后，感到我们的祖国真是太伟大太可爱了。”大家更增强了粉碎美帝国主义经济封锁，用自己的资源来建设我们祖国的信心和决心。
    听取了两个访问团的工作报告后，北京市工商局局长彭城说：北京除和上海、杭州、中南签订合同外，还和平原、绥远等地区先后签订了一千二百亿元物资交流的合同和协议，这是北京工商界一件很可喜的事情。他号召全市工商界不要满足合同的签订，他说：签订合同还仅是工作的开始，今后要努力防止单纯盈利观点，要为提高产品的产量和质量，保证合同和协议的彻底实现。
