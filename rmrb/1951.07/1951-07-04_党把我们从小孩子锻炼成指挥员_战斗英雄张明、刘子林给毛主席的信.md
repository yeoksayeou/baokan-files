The Party Has Trained Us from Children into Commanders
-- A Letter to Chairman Mao from Combat Heroes Zhang Ming and Liu Zilin

(I) Respected Chairman Mao:
	On this great 30th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party! I extend to you my warmest and highest respects, and wish you good health!
	Last September, I met you at the National Congress of Combat Heroes, and I had the honor of shaking your hand. My long-cherished wish was fulfilled, and my emotions were indescribable, my eyes filled with tears. Chairman Mao, meeting you has further strengthened my determination and power to fight to the end for the motherland and the people!
	After the Congress of Heroes and Model Workers closed, I also accompanied our Chinese Youth Delegation on a visit to the Soviet Union. During the three and a half months of our visit to the Soviet Union, we were warmly welcomed everywhere by the Soviet people and youth. At every welcoming rally, we saw portraits of Comrade Stalin and portraits of you. They shouted, "Long live Comrade Stalin!" and also shouted, "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" From the loudspeakers on the reviewing stand on the anniversary of the October Revolution, it was constantly shouted, "Long live the heroic Chinese people!"
	Once, on a street in Moscow, many children surrounded me and asked me to sign autographs. A five-year-old child asked me, "Have you seen Mao Zedong?" I replied, "I have seen him." He then asked me, "Is Mao Zedong fat?" I told him, "Little friend, thank you, Comrade Mao Zedong is in good health!" At this time, a little girl wearing a red scarf heard this and said, "I hope that after you return to China, when you see Comrade Mao Zedong again, you will say hello for us, and say that the Soviet children love him very much."
	In Leningrad, when Comrade Zhao Xingyuan and I were invited to visit the International University, young students from more than a dozen countries welcomed us by singing the national anthem of our great motherland in different languages. They lifted us up and threw us into the air more than twenty times in a row. As they threw us, they shouted, "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long live the heroic Chinese people!" "Long live the heroic soldiers of Mao Zedong!". In Sverdlovsk, when Korean students saw us off, the train started, and they continued to run alongside the train, shouting, "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" Chairman Mao, the peace-loving people of the world love you so much that we feel that with you, we have glory, with you, we have victory; it also makes us proud to be a soldier of Mao Zedong, and we will work day and night for you and the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people.
	Chairman Mao, I was originally a child from a poor peasant family. I remember when I joined the revolution at the age of fourteen, I couldn't even carry a gun at that time, and my comrades called me "Little Eighth Route." In the past fourteen years, thanks to your and the Party's cultivation and education, I have been transformed from a "Little Eighth Route" orderly into a commander. If I were still in the old society, I don't know what kind of oppression and suffering I would be subjected to! After returning to China this time, I went home once when I passed through Shandong. My family also received land, and my mother said to me, "This was all given by Chairman Mao."
	Chairman Mao, like every comrade in our unit, I miss you all the time, especially during the most intense and difficult battles. As long as I think of you, I feel that I have infinite power, and no difficulty can withstand it. Your great strength inspires us, enabling us to overcome all difficulties and move forward bravely.
	I also remember that in the battles of Danweizi and Weihuazhuang in the Jinan Campaign, due to my underestimation of the enemy and the error of one-rush-ism in command, we also fought losing battles. I was once proud of victory and developed the idea of individual heroism. However, thanks to the Party's timely education of me, I recognized my mistakes, and I have made progress in constantly overcoming my mistakes. This has made me clearly realize that all honors belong to you and the Communist Party.
	Chairman Mao: Finally, let me tell you that since I returned from my visit to the Soviet Union, I have made more than sixty reports on my impressions of the visit to the Soviet Union among various agencies, troops, and local people from all walks of life. Under the instructions of my superiors and with the help of my comrades, I have also written a 120,000-word impression of my visit to the Soviet Union. Now I am about to return to the troops to work.
	Chairman Mao, I will repay your love and cultivation with greater effort and more achievements. I extend to you my revolutionary salute!

Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Ming is a combat hero of a certain unit of the Third Field Army, a recipient of the People's Hero Medal, and a regimental-level commander.

(II) Respected Chairman Mao:
	I am very happy to be able to celebrate the "July 1st" festival here in Beijing, the people's capital, where you are located, because I was selected to represent the Chinese People's Liberation Army youth to participate in the upcoming Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin, Germany. At the same time, I will never forget that I am able to achieve today's glory because of the long-term education and training you and the Chinese Communist Party have given me.
	Recalling fourteen years ago, I was still a poor firewood-gathering child growing up in a poor peasant family, unable to eat enough or wear warm clothes all day long. Only under the leadership and education of you and the Chinese Communist Party did we turn ourselves over and embark on the road to liberation.
	After the start of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, I joined the Eighth Route Army. I was only twelve years old at that time, and my height was not as tall as a rifle. At first, I worked as an orderly in a clinic. At that time, the Japanese devils were frantically besieging our Jin-Cha-Ji border region, and many Communist Party members and outstanding commanders and fighters of the Eighth Route Army were gloriously wounded in battle for the cause of national liberation. During treatment, many people eagerly requested to return to the battlefield before their wounds had fully healed. Their heroic behavior made me initially realize what kind of person deserves to be called a Communist Party member.
	In 1939, I was transferred to work in the propaganda team. From the paintings, I saw your portrait for the first time, and the comrades also told us about "On Protracted War" that you wrote. Since then, whenever I encountered difficulties in persisting in the struggle against the enemy, I thought of you and what you said. This gave me infinite strength and overcame many difficulties.
	In the spring of 1942, I was working as a traffic officer in the armed work team. Once, I was unfortunately captured by the enemy. They brutally inflicted various tortures on me and cunningly threatened and lured me in various ways. At this time, I thought of the scenes of many Communist Party members and outstanding people's soldiers being unyielding in the face of the enemy's execution ground. Therefore, I gritted my teeth and did not reveal a single word. Later, I finally escaped when the enemy was unprepared. After returning to the enemy work station this time, I was honorably accepted as a member of the Chinese Communist Party.
	During a long period of the Liberation War, I served as a company commander. Thanks to your and the Communist Party's long-term education and training, I understood how to command troops. I know that our troops must not only have high-level combat skills, but also ensure that every soldier has a high level of class consciousness. Therefore, I often studied the company's political work with the company's Party branch secretary and political instructor to improve the company's combat effectiveness.
	Under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, because we fully exerted the core role of the company's Party branch, the Communist Party members united all the soldiers and behaved very bravely and tenaciously in battle, so we achieved great victories in every battle and completed various arduous tasks. In the Huaihai Campaign, under the direct command of the regimental headquarters, we repelled many enemy attacks and held our position for five days and six nights, successfully completing the task of blocking the bandit Li Yannian's army.
	Although we also encountered difficulties. After crossing the Yangtze River, when we served as the vanguard of the entire division, chasing and annihilating the fleeing Chiang bandit 143rd Division to Xinglongkeng Ridge in Dexing County, Jiangxi Province, the enemy's 143rd Division controlled the commanding heights and used the dangerous terrain to prevent our army's pursuit. Our company was sandwiched in the mountainside, with enemies on both sides, and it was raining heavily. When the situation was extremely critical, I thought of the People's Army commanders trained by you must come up with ways to overcome difficulties at this critical moment. So I reorganized the troops. Concentrated firepower to occupy the enemy's favorable position - Changting. Finally, the location of the enemy's division headquarters and a large number of troops was found, and the bandit troops were caught off guard and finally surrendered their weapons in droves. Within three hours, we wiped out the entire 143rd Division of Chiang bandits, and the bandit army commander Yan Shangyuan was also captured by us. Later, when I was promoted to deputy battalion commander of the Third Battalion, in the Nafuwei battle north of Taishan, Guangdong, I similarly led only one squad and rushed into the Guangdong Security Fourth Division headquarters of the Chiang bandits, and in this way, without firing a shot, disarmed more than 2,700 soldiers of the entire bandit army.
	Chairman Mao, the reason why I can become a combat hero and achieve today's honor is all due to the long-term education and training you and the Chinese Communist Party have given me. In the future, I will definitely study modernized military technology better, strive to establish more brilliant achievements in eliminating the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Taiwan, defending the motherland, and defending the cause of peace, in order to repay your and the Chinese Communist Party's long-term education, training, and care for me.

### 党把我们从小孩子锻炼成指挥员——战斗英雄张明、刘子林给毛主席的信

　　党把我们从小孩子锻炼成指挥员
    ——战斗英雄张明、刘子林给毛主席的信
    （一）敬爱的毛主席：
    在这伟大的中国共产党三十周年纪念的时候！我热烈地向您致以崇高的敬礼，并祝您身体健康！
    去年九月，我在全国战斗英雄代表会议上见到了您，并且光荣地和您握了手，多年的愿望实现了，我的感情激动得难以形容，眼眶里包满了眼泪。毛主席，见了您，使我越加增强了为祖国为人民奋斗到底的决心和力量！
    英雄模范代表会议闭幕后，我又随同我们中国青年代表团一起访问了苏联。在访苏的三个半月中，我们到处受到苏联人民和青年们的热烈欢迎。在每一个欢迎会上，我们看到斯大林同志的像，也看到您的像，他们喊：“斯大林同志万岁！”也喊“毛泽东同志万岁！”在十月革命节检阅台上的扩音机里，不断地喊着：“英勇的中国人民万岁！”
    有一次，在莫斯科的大街上，有许多儿童围着我要我给他们签名，一个五周岁的小孩子问我：“看到过毛泽东没有？”我回答说：“见到过。”他又问我：“毛泽东胖不胖？”我告诉他说：“小朋友，谢谢您，毛泽东同志身体很健康！”这时有一个系红领巾的小姑娘听到后又说：“希望您回国后，再见到毛泽东同志，要替我们问好，说我们苏联的小朋友都很热爱他。”
    在列宁格勒，当我和赵兴元同志被邀请到国际大学参观的时候，十几个国家的青年学生用不同的语言高唱着我们伟大祖国的国歌欢迎我们。他们把我们抬起来接连抛了二十多次。他们一面抛一面高呼：“毛泽东同志万岁！”“英勇的中国人民万岁！”“英勇的毛泽东的战士万岁！”。在斯维尔罗夫城，朝鲜留学生欢送我们时，火车开动了，他们还一面跟着火车跑，一面高呼：“毛泽东同志万岁！”毛主席，全世界爱好和平的人民是这样热爱着您，使我们觉得有了您就有了光荣，有了您就有了胜利；也使我们觉得自己是一个毛泽东的战士而自傲，我们要为了您和中国人民的解放事业日夜努力。
    毛主席，我本来是一个贫苦农民家里的孩子。记得我十四岁参加革命时，那时还扛不动枪，同志们都喊我是“小八路”。十四年来，由于您和党的培养和教育，使我从一个“小八路”勤务员锻炼成为一个指挥员。假如我还在旧社会里，还不知道受着怎样的压迫和苦痛呢！这次回国后，路过山东我回家了一次，我的家里也分得了土地，母亲对我说：“这都是毛主席给的。”
    毛主席，我和我们部队的每个同志都一样，时时刻刻想念着您，尤其是在战斗最激烈最艰苦的时候，只要一想起你，我们就觉得有了无穷的力量，任何困难也抵当不住。你的伟大力量激励着我们，使我们排除万难，奋勇前进。
    我也想起，在外线出击的单圩子战斗和济南战役的魏华庄战斗中，由于我指挥上的轻敌和一冲主义的错误，我们也打了失利仗。我曾因胜利而骄傲，滋长了个人英雄主义的思想。可是，由于党对我即时的教育，使我认识了自己的错误，我也就在不断地克服自己的错误中获得进步。这也就使我明确认识到：一切的荣誉都是属于您和共产党的。
    毛主席：最后让我告诉你，自我访苏回国后，在各机关、部队和地方各界人民中，已作了六十多次关于访苏观感的报告。在上级的指示和同志们的帮助下，并写了一篇十二万字的访苏印象记。现在就要回部队去工作了。
    毛主席，我将以更大的努力和更多的成绩来回答你的爱护与培养。谨向您致以革命的敬礼！
                          张明
    编者按：张明同志是第三野战军某部战斗英雄，人民英雄奖章获得者、团级指挥员。
        （二）敬爱的毛主席：
    我由于被选派代表中国人民解放军青年去参加即将在德国柏林召开的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节大会，从西南来到人民的首都——北京，您所在的地方。能够在这里过“七一”节，使我感到很高兴，同时我永远也忘不了我所以能够得到今天这样的光荣，都是由于您和中国共产党对我长期教育培养的结果。
    回忆起十四年前，我还是生长在贫农家庭里的一个穷苦的拾柴禾的孩子，一天到晚吃不饱，穿不暖。只有在您和中国共产党的领导与教养下，才使我们翻了身，走上了解放的道路。
    一九三七年抗日战争开始后，我参加了八路军。那时只有十二岁，个子还没有步枪那么高。起初我是在一个卫生所里当勤务员。当时，正值日本鬼子疯狂地向我晋察冀边区围攻，有许多共产党员和优秀的八路军指战员为着民族解放事业，光荣地在战斗中负了伤。治疗时，许多人伤口还没有全好就急急地要求重返战场。他们这种英雄行为，使我初步认识到什么样的人才称得起是一个共产党员。
    一九三九年，我被调到宣传队工作。从画片里，我第一次看见了您的像，同志们还给我们讲了您所写的《论持久战》。自此以后，每当在坚持对敌斗争中遇到困难时，我就想起了您和您所说的话。这就使我增加了无穷的力量，克服了许多的困难。
    一九四二年春天，我正在武装工作队里做交通员的工作。有一次，不幸被敌人捕住了。他们残暴地给我上了各种刑罚，并且狡猾地以多种多样的方式来威吓利诱我。这时，我想起了许多共产党员和优秀的人民战士在敌人刑场面前不屈不挠的情景。因此，我就咬紧牙关，一字不露。后来我终于趁敌人没有防备的时候，逃了出来。这次回到对敌工作站后，我光荣地被吸收为中国共产党员。
    解放战争中很长的一段期间，我担任连长，由于您和共产党对我长期的教育和培养，使我懂得了应该怎样指挥部队。我知道我们的部队不仅要有高度的作战技术，而且还必须使每个战士都有高度的阶级觉悟。因此，我经常与连队党的支部书记，政治指导员研究连队的政治工作，提高连队的战斗力。
    在上级党委的领导下，由于我们充分地发挥了连队党的支部核心作用，共产党员团结了全体战士，在战斗中表现得非常勇敢顽强，所以我们在每次战役中都获得了很大的胜利，完成了各种艰巨的任务。在淮海战役中，我们在团部直接指挥下，曾打退了敌人很多次攻击，坚守阵地五天六夜，胜利地完成了阻击匪军李延年兵团的任务。
    虽然，我们也曾碰到过困难。渡江后，当我们担任全师的前卫，追歼南逃蒋匪一四三师部队至江西德兴县兴龙坑岭时，敌人一四三师控制着制高点，利用险要的地形来阻止我军的追击，我们的连队被夹在半山中，两面都是敌人，天又下着大雨，正在情况万分危急的时候，我想起了在您培养下的人民军队指挥员，必须要在这种紧急关头，想出办法来克服困难。于是就重新组织了兵力。集中火力占领了敌人有利阵地——长亭。最后，找到了敌人师部和大批部队驻扎的地方，匪军们措手不及，终于成群地交出他们的武器。在三个钟头内，我们就把蒋匪一四三师全部歼灭，匪军师长阎尚元也被我们俘掳住了。后来，当我升任为三营副营长时，在广东台山以北的那夫圩战斗中，我同样地仅带领一个班，冲进蒋匪广东保安第四师师部，就这样不费一枪一弹，把匪军全师二千七百余人缴了械。
    毛主席，我所以能够成为战斗英雄，能够得到今天这样的荣誉，都是由于您和中国共产党对我长期教育培养的结果。今后，我一定要更好地学习现代化的军事技术，争取在歼灭台湾蒋介石残匪、保卫祖国、保卫和平事业中，建立更辉煌的功绩，来报答您和中国共产党对我长期的教育培养和关怀。
                                                刘子林
