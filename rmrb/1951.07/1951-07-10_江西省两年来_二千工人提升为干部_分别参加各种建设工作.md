　　Jiangxi Province in Two Years
    Two Thousand Workers Promoted to Cadres
    Participating in Various Construction Projects
    In the past two years, nearly two thousand workers in Jiangxi Province have been promoted to cadres and have participated in various construction projects. After the liberation of Jiangxi Province in 1949, under the direct leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and through movements such as resumption of production, resisting America and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the consciousness of the working class has rapidly increased; a large number of worker activists have emerged in the movements. More than one thousand nine hundred and ninety of these activists have been promoted to enterprise administrative management cadres and trade union leading cadres after being trained and educated by the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. Among them, in addition to eight hundred and thirty-nine people participating in the work of the Party Committee, the government, and other departments, four hundred and nineteen people serve as vice chairmen and ministers of provincial industrial trade unions, ministers and section chiefs of municipal federations of trade unions, etc., and seven hundred and thirty-nine people hold administrative management positions in factories and enterprises. These worker cadres have played an active leading and backbone role in various work positions. For example, Liu Zhengyuan, a bridge worker of the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Bureau, took the lead in mobilizing workers to rush-repair the Yangsi Bridge and Dongguan Wisteria Bridge (a total of 34 spans, 218 meters) in three days and nights after liberation, ensuring the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army; after being promoted to deputy section chief of the public works section, he became even more active and responsible in his work; last year, he was rated as a provincial labor model. Tan Miaogen of Nanchang Hydroelectric Company used to be a supervisor. After being promoted to deputy engineer last year, he not only worked actively and responsibly, but also was able to overcome difficulties and restore a 2100-kilowatt generator from inoperable to generating electricity, and was therefore selected as a provincial-level labor model. Huang Yifu, vice chairman of the Nanchang Municipal Handicraft Industry Federation, used to be a worker in the restaurant industry. After being promoted to vice chairman of the trade union, he was able to work hard, rely on the masses, care for the masses, and solve problems for the masses in his work. Last year, he was selected as a model worker. In addition, many other worker cadres have been selected as labor models and model workers.       (Ma Changyou)

　　江西省两年来
    二千工人提升为干部
    分别参加各种建设工作
    江西省两年来有近两千名工人被提升为干部，分别参加了各种建设工作。江西省一九四九年解放后，在中国共产党江西省委、江西省人民政府和江西省总工会的直接领导下，经过复工生产、抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动，工人阶级觉悟迅速提高；在运动中涌现出大批工人积极分子。这些积极分子，经过省总工会的培养与教育，已有一千九百九十余人被提升为企业行政管理干部和工会领导干部。其中除八百三十九人参加了党委、政府和其他部门工作外，担任省级产业工会副主席、部长、市总工会部长、科长等职的有四百一十九人，担任工厂企业行政管理工作的有七百三十九人。这些工人干部，在各种工作岗位上，都发挥了积极带头和骨干作用。如江西省公路局桥工刘正元，解放后积极带头发动工人三昼夜抢修了杨泗桥、东馆藤桥（计三十四孔，二百十八公尺），保证了人民解放大军胜利前进；被提升为工务段副段长后，工作更加积极负责；去年被评为全省劳动模范。南昌水电公司谈妙根过去是个监工，去年被提升为副工程师后，不仅工作积极负责，并且能克服困难，使二一○○千瓦发电机从不能运转，重新修复发电，因而被选为全省甲等劳动模范。南昌市手工业联合会副主席黄以富，过去是菜馆业的工人，被提升为工会副主席后，在工作中能吃苦耐劳，依靠群众，关心群众，给群众解决问题，去年被选为模范工作者。此外，还有很多工人干部被选为劳动模范与模范工作者。       （马长有）
