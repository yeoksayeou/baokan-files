　　Deepen the Political Mobilization Work of Purchasing and Storing Cotton
　　Yang Bo
　　For more than a month, in the main cotton-producing areas across the country, under the strong leadership of governments and Party committees at all levels, and after in-depth political mobilization, considerable achievements have been made in the work of selling and storing cotton. A mass patriotic movement of selling and storing cotton is underway. After understanding the principle that "only by protecting the country can we prosper our families," cotton farmers are actively selling and storing their surplus cotton to the state. Many villages in cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces, after in-depth political mobilization, have launched sales and storage competitions between households and villages, achieving good results. Facts have proven that as long as we can explain the principles to farmers, clarify policies, and strengthen patriotic political education, the vast majority of farmers can sell and store their surplus cotton to the state.
　　However, from a national perspective, the development of this movement is still very uneven. Many county and district leading organs have not paid enough attention to the great political significance and arduousness of this cotton purchasing and storage work, simply thinking that it is the task of trade companies and cooperatives, and their responsibility is only to issue instructions and calls. Some cadres believe that "buying cotton with money, do we still need to put so much effort into mobilizing?" Therefore, they have relaxed the political and ideological leadership of selling and storing cotton. Many cotton farmers have ideological concerns about selling and storing cotton, such as fear of revealing wealth, fear of people borrowing, fear of donations, fear of increasing components, fear of cooperatives recovering grain and fertilizer loans, and fear of losing out if cotton prices rise in the future, thus affecting the further development of the movement. Therefore, how to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of cotton purchasing and storage work and eliminate the various ideological concerns of cotton farmers has become the key to continuing to promote this movement forward.
　　Local experiences have proven that the ideological concerns of cotton farmers cannot be completely eliminated by holding one or two meetings or giving speeches. It is necessary to patiently and repeatedly carry out ideological education, using concrete historical examples of the Communist Party and the People's Government leading the people to stand up, supporting farmers' production, and ensuring the interests of cotton farmers, to explain the principle that "only by protecting the country can we prosper our families," so that cotton farmers can sell all their surplus cotton. Cadres in Beiyukou Village, Chengan County, Hebei Province, originally thought that the village could produce at most 2,000 jin of cotton, but after repeated and in-depth mobilization, the masses came up with 10,180 jin. One cotton farmer in the village sold all 920 jin of seed cotton after four mobilizations. This situation exists everywhere. If we are only satisfied with general mobilization, we cannot solve the problem. Even some Party members and cadres must undergo repeated ideological mobilization before they can sell and store their surplus cotton to the state. The secretary of the Zhangzhuang branch of the Communist Party of China in Wuqiao County, Shandong Province, sold 260 jin of cotton after the first mobilization by district cadres, and another 700 jin after the second mobilization. However, according to the investigation, he still has more than 3,000 jin in storage. All of this tells us that cotton farmers do have surplus cotton, but we must grasp ideological leadership and repeatedly and patiently carry out political mobilization to eliminate their ideological concerns and consciously and voluntarily sell and store their surplus cotton to the state.
　　At present, there are two different approaches to the mobilization work of purchasing and storing cotton in various places. One is: conscientious and responsible, with a sincere attitude; focusing on opening up the minds of cotton farmers, combining the work of purchasing and storing cotton with the current movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, using vivid and concrete examples of how the Communist Party and the People's Government lead farmers to produce and become rich and protect the interests of farmers, to explain the flesh-and-blood relationship between the country and the people today, to enlighten cotton farmers and eliminate concerns. Some villages in Dongguang County, Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, have combined the work of purchasing and storing cotton with the propaganda and education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and commemorating "July 1st," educating them with the specific evil deeds of Japanese invaders, traitors, Kuomintang reactionaries, landlords, and reactionary secret societies in the past who oppressed, exploited, and harmed cotton farmers, and made cartoon propaganda to mobilize the masses to accuse them, and compared the current life with the past, and the result was very effective. One farmer who never liked to participate in meetings in the past not only took out his surplus cotton to sell after this education, but also voluntarily proposed to guarantee to mobilize several households to sell cotton. After the education of the history of the Communist Party of China in some villages, farmers said: "The food we eat was obtained by the sacrifice and bloodshed of comrades," "This year's cotton is good, there is the blood of comrades on the cotton plants!" In this way, the cotton purchasing and storage work in the area has proceeded more smoothly.
　　The other approach is the opposite of the above approach. They do not think carefully when mobilizing, and they do it simply. They mistakenly put forward slogans such as "Whoever has cotton and does not sell it is a reactionary" and "Saving a pound of cotton is equivalent to saving an American devil." Some simply hold a meeting to report and then assign tasks to each household. This approach cannot encourage cotton farmers to quickly take out their surplus cotton, but on the contrary, it will further increase the ideological concerns of cotton farmers and even create antagonistic emotions.
　　When carrying out patriotic education on selling and storing cotton, we must not only make the great political significance of this movement "known to every household," but also make the men, women, and children in farm households understand the ideology. Local experience has proven that if women in the family do not understand the ideology, the progress of this work will be greatly hindered. Therefore, how to do a good job in the political mobilization of rural women and mobilize them to sell and store their own "private cotton" is also very important.
　　For more than a month, the achievements of cotton purchasing and storage work in various places are still far from the overall plan. Now the yarn factories across the country have been shut down for more than a month. In order to ensure the supply of raw cotton after the yarn factories start work soon, the people's governments and the CCP committees in the cotton-producing areas must further strengthen the leadership of cotton purchasing and storage work, conduct timely supervision and inspection, vigorously carry out political mobilization work, and ensure the victorious completion of this task.

### 深入进行购棉储棉的政治动员工作

　　深入进行购棉储棉的政治动员工作
    杨波
    月余以来，全国各主要产棉区的售棉、储棉工作，在各级政府、党委的大力领导下，经过深入的政治动员，已收到相当成绩。群众性的爱国主义的售棉、储棉运动，正在开展。棉农在了解了“只有保国才能发家”的道理后，多积极将自己的存棉售储于国家。河北、山西、平原等省产棉区的许多村庄经过深入的政治动员后，展开了户与户，村与村的售棉、储棉竞赛。收到良好成绩。事实证明：只要我们能向农民讲清道理，说明政策，加强爱国主义的政治教育，广大农民是可以将自己的存棉售、储给国家的。
    但从全国范围看，目前这一运动发展的还很不平衡。不少县、区领导机关对这次购棉、储棉工作的重大政治意义及其艰巨性，尚未引起高度的重视，单纯的认为这是贸易公司与合作社的任务，自己的责任只是发发指示、号召一下。有的干部则认为“拿钱买棉花，还用得着费这么大劲去动员？”因而放松了售棉储棉的政治、思想领导；许多棉农对售、储棉花存有怕露白、怕人借、怕捐献、怕提高成份、怕合作社收回贷粮、贷肥，怕将来棉花价钱贵了自己吃亏等思想顾虑，因而影响了运动的进一步深入开展。因此，如何加强购棉、储棉工作的政治、思想领导，解除棉农的各种思想顾虑，已成为目前继续推动这一运动向前发展的关键。
    各地经验证明，棉农的思想顾虑，决不是开一两次会，讲讲话，报告一回即能完全解除的；而是须要耐心地反复不断地进行思想教育，以共产党和人民政府领导人民翻身、扶植农民生产、保证棉农利益的具体历史实例，说明“只有保国才能发家”的道理，才能使棉农将其存棉全部卖出。河北省成安县北鱼口村干部原来认为该村最多能搞出两千斤棉花，但经过反复深入动员后，结果群众拿出了一万零一百八十斤。该村有一户棉农，经过四次动员之后才把籽棉九百二十斤全部卖出。这种情形各地都有。如果我们只满足于大会动员，是不能解决问题的。甚至有些党员、干部，亦须经过反复地思想动员，才能将存棉售、储给国家。山东吴桥县张庄中共支部书记第一次经区干部动员，出售棉花二百六十斤，第二次动员后，又拿出七百斤。但据调查，他还存有三千多斤。这一切都告诉我们，棉农确有存棉；但必须抓紧思想领导，反复耐心地进行政治动员，才能解除其思想顾虑，将存棉自觉自愿的售、储于国家。
    目前各地在购棉、储棉的动员工作中，存在着两种不同的作法。一种是：认真负责，态度诚恳；着重于打通棉农思想，把购棉、储棉工作与目前的抗美援朝，镇压反革命运动结合在一起，以共产党、人民政府如何领导农民生产致富，保护农民利益的生动具体实例，说明今天国家与人民的血肉相联的关系，启发棉农觉悟，消除顾虑。山东德州专区东光县的部分村庄，曾把购棉、储棉工作与抗美援朝及纪念“七一”的宣传教育相结合，以日寇、汉奸、国民党反动派、地主恶霸、反动会道门等过去欺压、剥削、残害棉农的具体罪恶事实进行教育，并制成漫画宣传，发动群众控诉，把现在与过去的生活对比，结果收效很大。有一位过去从来不大愿意参加会的农民，经过这次教育后，不仅将自己的存棉拿出来卖了，并且还自动提出保证动员几户卖棉花。有的村经过中共党史的教育，农民说：“我们吃的饭都是同志们牺牲流血得来的”，“今年棉花好，棉花棵子上都有同志们的血呀！”这样，该地的购棉、储棉工作即进行得比较顺利。
    另一种作法，与上述作法相反，他们在动员时不加思考，简单从事，错误地提出：“谁有棉花不卖，就是反动派”，“保存一斤棉花，就等于保存一个美国鬼子”等口号。有的是简单的开个会报告一下，就挨家挨户分配任务。这种作法不能启发棉农将存棉迅速拿出，相反地更会助长棉农的思想顾虑，甚至产生对立情绪。
    在进行爱国主义的售棉、储棉教育时，不但要作到使这一运动的重大政治意义“家喻户晓”，而且要作到农户中男女老少都能搞通思想。各地经验证明，如果家庭中的妇女思想不通，这一工作的进展也就会受到很大的阻碍。因之，如何作好农村妇女的政治动员工作，并发动她们售储自己的“私房棉”，也是非常重要的。
    一月多来，各地购棉、储棉工作的成绩，与整个计划相较，仍相差很大。现在全国纱厂停工已逾一月，为保证不久纱厂开工后的原棉供应，各产棉区人民政府和中共党委还必须进一步加强对购棉、储棉工作的领导，及时进行督促检查，大力作好政治动员工作，保证这一任务的胜利完成。
