　　Greek Civil Servants' Strike Expands
    U.S. Envoy in Greece Publicly Engages in Shameless Intimidation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Athens] News from Athens: The general strike of 70,000 Greek civil servants, which began on July 7, is still bravely continuing and expanding. On July 10, 40,000 judicial personnel joined the strike, which demands a 50 percent wage increase, bringing the total number of strikers to 110,000. The strike has been warmly supported by the entire Greek working class. Employees of the Athens and Piraeus municipal councils held a three-hour solidarity strike on the 12th.

    Now, U.S. imperialism and the royalist fascist government are trying every means to undermine the strike. The U.S. Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Peurifoy, openly spoke to representatives of the executive committee of the Civil Servants' Trade Union Federation, demanding that civil servants immediately stop the strike. Peurifoy shamelessly threatened the strikers, saying that if the U.S. senators who are about to visit Greece learn about the strike, it will affect U.S. "aid" to Greece. The reactionary Greek government also openly threatened to implement "demilitarization" against the strikers on the 9th. After this threat proved ineffective, government ministers exerted pressure on their senior civil servants on the 12th, demanding that they return to work. However, these civil servants still refused to return to work.

    The executive committee of the Civil Servants' Trade Union Federation recently issued a communiqué stating that the strike will not stop until the legitimate demands of the civil servants are met.

### 希腊公务员罢工扩大  美驻希使节公然进行无耻恫吓

　　希腊公务员罢工扩大
    美驻希使节公然进行无耻恫吓
    【新华社十五日讯】雅典消息：自七月七日开始的希腊全国七万公务员总罢工迄今仍在英勇坚持并继续扩大中。七月十日，四万司法人员参加了这个要求增加工资百分之五十的罢工，罢工人数因此已达十一万。罢工受到了希腊全体工人阶级的热烈支持，雅典与比里犹斯市政委员会的雇员就曾在十二日举行三小时的声援罢工。
    现在，美帝国主义与保皇法西斯政府，正在用一切办法想法破坏罢工。美国驻希腊大使比里福埃公然对公务员工会联合会执行委员会的代表讲话，要公务员立即停止罢工。比里福埃无耻地恫吓罢工者说，如果罢工的事情让即将来希腊的美国参议员们知道了，就会影响美国对希腊的“援助”。希腊反动政府也在九日公然以要对罢工者实行“非军事动员”相威胁。在这种威胁无效以后，政府各部长又在十二日向自己属下的高级公务员施行压力，要他们复工。但是，这些公务员依然拒绝复工。
    公务员工会联合会执行委员会最近发表的公报指出：不到公务员的正当要求得到满足，决不停止罢工。
