　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 29th: After a ten-day government crisis in Italy, the Italian reactionaries, brazenly ignoring the desire of the people across the country to form a government of peace, have once again formed a "new" government on the 26th, headed by Christian Democrat Gasperi, the former Prime Minister who has consistently served the American war policy, along with the Republican Party.

　　In this government, the former Minister of Defense, Bacciarelli, who faithfully implemented the US's policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and the former Minister of the Interior, Scelba, who adopted various fascist means to suppress the Italian people, both remain in their positions. In order to deceive the people and quell the infighting within the Italian reactionary camp, Gasperi himself took over as Minister of Foreign Affairs, replacing the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sforza, who had been strongly opposed by the people for implementing a completely traitorous and pro-American foreign policy. However, Sforza still serves as a Minister without Portfolio in the "new" government. The former Minister of Treasury and Budget, Bella, whose actions directly led to the collapse of the previous government, remains as Budget Minister, with Finance Minister Vanoni concurrently holding the post of Treasury Minister; however, even the Associated Press admits that Bella "can still tightly control Italy's financial policy," which "cannot satisfy those who criticize Bella." In addition, in order to please the "opposition" within his own Christian Democratic Party, Gasperi appointed Fanfani, the leader of this "opposition," as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, attempting to mend the growing rifts within the Christian Democratic Party.

　　However, Gasperi and his ilk's trick of reorganizing the government is so clumsy and so detested by the people that even the reactionary Saragat right-wing Socialists and the Liberal Party have declared their refusal to participate in the "new" government for "tactical" reasons.

　　Soviet international affairs commentator Orestov wrote in "Pravda" that the current crisis in Italy is a crisis of the entire political line of the Christian Democratic Party and the bankruptcy of the ruling regime. The "reorganization" of the pro-American government cannot eliminate this crisis. Only by resolutely rejecting the policies that incite war and oppress the Italian people, and only by implementing a genuine policy of peace, can the country escape the crisis.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 29th: TASS, Rome, 28th: Italian newspapers, commenting on Gasperi's newly formed cabinet, pointed out that the formation of the new cabinet has not resolved the political crisis that has emerged within the majority faction, but the course of events shows that Gasperi is unable to form a new cabinet that is essentially different from his previous cabinet formed after the departure of the Liberal Party and the Saragat faction. The secretary of the Liberal Party, Villabruna, told an ANSA reporter that the new cabinet is "a worse version of the previous cabinet." The official newspaper "Il Messaggero" asserted that the new cabinet is "no different" from the old cabinet. The Turin newspaper "La Stampa" wrote: "Now the government will face a very serious test in parliament." The well-informed "Corriere della Sera" said that although the new cabinet has been formed, "the national crisis of distrust and suspicion" has not been eliminated by far. The new government only shows that the "various tendencies within the Christian Democratic Party have temporarily achieved a balance." The newspaper believes that Gasperi's "general changes to the ministers in their positions have surprised everyone, and if they have not made everyone openly dissatisfied, then at least they have not satisfied everyone's demands." This dissatisfaction is also expressed in the Milan industrial community's organ "Il Sole 24 Ore." The newspaper admitted that if Gasperi wants everything to remain the same, "then reality will have a thousand times more authority than his intentions," and thus Italy is bound to experience an "economic crisis."

　　The Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, Longo, gave a brief review of the current situation in "Unità," saying: "The cabinet crisis erupted amidst conspiracies and squabbles over private matters. This is the first concrete manifestation of the national economy's inability to bear the arms expansion and war preparation policies imposed on Italy by the American imperialists. Gasperi's solution to the cabinet crisis is to reaffirm the course that leads the country to economic disaster and war disaster, and to reaffirm those who lead the country to economic disaster and war disaster. In other words, nothing has been resolved."

### 悍然不顾意国人民的和平愿望  加斯贝利重新组成反动政府

　　悍然不顾意国人民的和平愿望
　  加斯贝利重新组成反动政府
    【新华社二十九日讯】罗马消息：在意大利政府危机延续达十日以后，意大利反动派悍然不顾全国人民要求组织和平政府的愿望，仍以上届政府总理、一贯忠实为美国战争政策服务的基督教民主党人加斯贝利为首，在二十六日组成基督教民主党和共和党的“新”政府。
    在这个政府中，忠实执行美国的扩军备战政策的上届国防部长巴齐亚第，采取种种法西斯手段去镇压意大利人民的上届内政部长谢尔巴，都仍然连任。为了欺骗人民并平息意大利反动阵营内部的争吵，加斯贝利自兼外交部长，来代替因为执行彻底卖国媚美的外交政策而受到人民强烈反对的上届外交部长史佛卓。但是，史佛卓却仍然在“新”政府中任不管部长。直接促成上届政府垮台的上届国库与预算部长贝拉仍任预算部长，由财政部长万诺尼兼代国库部长；可是连美联社都承认：贝拉“仍然可以紧紧控制着意大利的财政政策”，这样就“不能使批评贝拉的人满足”。此外，加斯贝利为了讨好他自己的基督教民主党党内的“反对派”，就任命这个“反对派”的领袖范芳尼为农林部长，企图以此来弥补基督教民主党内越来越大的裂痕。
    但是，加斯贝利他们这种重组政府的把戏是这样拙劣，这样为人民厌弃，甚至反动的萨拉盖特右翼社会党和自由党也因为“策略”关系而声明拒绝参加“新”政府。
    苏联国际问题评论家奥列贺夫在《真理报》上撰文指出：意大利目前的危机是基督教民主党整个政治路线的危机，是统治政权的破产。亲美政府的“改组”是不能消除这个危机的。只有决心拒绝那引起战争和压迫意大利人民的政策，只有实行真正的和平政策，才能使国家摆脱危机。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社罗马二十八日讯：意大利报纸在评论加斯贝利组成的新内阁时指出：新阁的组成并没有解决多数派方面出现的政治危机，但事态的进程却表明加斯贝利没有能力组成一个在本质上与他在自由党与萨拉盖特派去职后所组成的前任内阁不同的新内阁。自由党书记魏拉布鲁纳对安莎通讯社记者表示，新内阁是“上届内阁的更坏的翻版”。官方报纸《报信者》断言，新内阁与旧内阁“并没有什么分别”。都灵报纸《邮报》写道：“现在政府就要在议会面临十分严重的考验了。”消息灵通的《晚邮报》说，虽然新阁组成了，可是“全国不信任与怀疑的危机”远没有消除。新政府只不过表明基督教民主党内部的“各种倾向暂时获得了平衡”而已。该报认为，加斯贝利对“各部长在职务上所作的一般更动使大家为之吃惊，如果还没有使大家公开不满的话，那么也至少是没有满足大家的要求。”这种不满的情绪同时也表现在米兰工业界的机关报《二十四小时》报上。该报承认，如果加斯贝利要一切照旧的话，“那么现实就会比他的意图有一千倍的权威”，这样，意大利就必然要发生“经济危机”。
    意大利共产党副总书记隆哥在“团结报”上对目前形势作了一个简要的评述，他说：“内阁危机是在阴谋倾轧与私人琐事争吵的情况下爆发的，这是本国经济无力负担美国帝国主义者所强加予意大利的扩军备战政策的第一个具体现象。加斯贝利解决内阁危机的办法是重新肯定使国家走向经济灾难与战争灾难的方针，并重新肯定那些把国家导向经济灾难与战争灾难的人。换句话说，也就是什么都没有解决。”
