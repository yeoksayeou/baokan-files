　　Soviet People Love the Chinese People
　  ——Impressions of Attending the “May Day” Parade in the Soviet Union
    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Combat Hero Wang Yougen
    I felt very honored to be invited by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to go to the Soviet Union to participate in the "May Day" parade.

    I departed from the capital, Beijing, on April 16th. Along the way, every Soviet train station was prepared for our enthusiastic welcome, offering us flowers and cheers. On April 26th, we arrived in Moscow and were greeted at the station with warm embraces and flowers from Soviet representatives.

    On "May Day," we stood on the majestic Red Square in Moscow to watch the parade. It started at nine o'clock in the morning. The first to pass through Red Square were the troops of various branches of the Soviet armed forces, the mighty force defending world peace. These troops were all mechanized, with heavy tanks and artillery including "Katyusha" rockets, automatic cannons, howitzers, and long-range guns. On the tanks and artillery barrels were written the numbers of enemies destroyed, the number of major battles participated in, and the distance traveled. When the air force personnel passed through Red Square, various types of aircraft flew overhead, including giant flying fortresses, destroyers, fighters, and jet aircraft. The Soviet jet aircraft were much faster than the American jet aircraft. From this point of view, the Soviet Union's defense capabilities are unmatched by any country. If the imperialists dare to risk launching a war, the result will surely be failure.

    Around ten o'clock, the marching contingents from twenty-five districts of Moscow approached the reviewing stand. The Soviet people love Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, as they love their own leader. They all held high portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and Comrade Zhou Enlai. The Chinese delegation became the focus of attention for the marchers from beginning to end. As they walked past the Chinese delegation, they shouted with extreme excitement, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Chinese people!" "Long live the heroes of resisting America and aiding Korea!" Some applauded, waved, and threw flowers and hats into the air. They were reluctant to leave after reaching the Chinese delegation. Some four- or five-year-old children, riding on their fathers' shoulders, also excitedly clapped their little hands and shouted, "China, hurrah! China, hurrah!" The representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were the most eye-catching figures, and many people came over specifically to salute us. Major General Vasily Petrov of the viewing platform came to the Chinese delegation and met with me and He Shuangjin, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and shook our hands tightly. He gazed at the commemorative medals on Comrade He Shuangjin's chest and stroked them, saying, "This is the North China Liberation Commemorative Medal, this is the People's Hero Medal, this is..." What a touching scene! The defenders of the Chinese and Soviet people, and the people of the world, in full military regalia with medals all over their chests, congratulated each other on victory on Red Square on the day of international workers' solidarity.

    The marchers kept cheering and throwing their beloved flowers at the Chinese delegation. Regardless of the rain, we kept our hands raised, cheering and congratulating. Old Man Lin, who was nearly seventy years old, and Old Man Shen, who was seventy-seven years old, completely forgot their fatigue and returned the salute to the marching crowds. Comrade Fedorov, who was next to us, said, "The 'May Day' photographers only need to stand in front of the Chinese delegation and take pictures facing the marching crowds, and that would be perfect. All the glory has been brought to the Chinese comrades." The Red Square parade most concentratedly demonstrated the great and profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    Why do the Soviet people show us such respect and love? Soviet General Vasily Petrov told us: "The Soviet people are very impressed with the victorious Chinese people's heroic support for Korea and their great internationalist action to defend world peace, and we extend our utmost concern and condolences to you. I am especially happy to be able to meet the glorious representatives of the Chinese people."

    The Soviet people are very concerned about the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea. They cut out articles and news about China's resistance to America and aid to Korea from Soviet newspapers and use them as their own study materials. At every banquet, Soviet comrades would stand up and toast to "congratulate the Chinese people on their victory in resisting America and aiding Korea." The Pravda reporter repeatedly interviewed me about the real situation of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield and published a dispatch in a prominent position in Pravda. The Soviet people's eager concern further encouraged our fighting spirit.

    In Moscow, in addition to attending the "May Day" parade, we also visited for half a month. What impressed me most was the Moscow Soviet Red Army Museum, which displayed many historical traces of the Red Army martyrs. For example, during the Soviet-German war, communication between a command post and the front line was suddenly interrupted. A signal soldier crawled through artillery fire to check the wires. When he reached the place where the wires had been blown apart by artillery fire, his hands were already injured and unable to move. However, the task of connecting the wires was very urgent. He tried his best to use his mouth to hold the two wire ends together, biting them together, and successfully completed the task of connecting the wires before sacrificing himself due to electrocution. To commemorate this martyr, the wires he used at that time are still preserved in the Red Army Museum. Also, during the Soviet-German war, a regiment defended a position near Moscow very bravely. The party secretary of the regiment called on everyone, saying, "Moscow is behind us, we cannot retreat!" To protect the national military flag, he finally hid the flag inside his shirt and heroically sacrificed himself. When his remains were exhumed in 1949, they discovered the blood-stained military flag, which is now preserved in the museum as a permanent memorial. The Red Army Museum also has a rifle that killed more than 300 enemies. The stock of the rifle was eventually broken, and the hero who used the rifle also gloriously sacrificed himself. The visit to the Red Army Museum gave me a profound education. Thinking of my own accomplishments, which people have praised, I feel ashamed compared to these heroic deeds. I am determined to work harder and learn from these heroes.

    We also visited the Moscow Historical Museum, which displays fossils from various historical stages of the evolution of apes into humans. A person who preserves antiquities once received a Stalin Prize. The Soviet people love their motherland. Their emphasis on historical relics and their spirit of preserving ancient sites are also worth learning from.

    In Moscow, we also visited agricultural machinery factories, textile factories, and cigarette factories. The workers' welfare and hygiene facilities inside are very complete and comprehensive. In the past, workers in general cigarette factories were prone to heart disease, and cotton fibers flew everywhere in textile factories, and workers were prone to bronchitis and arthritis due to the need to spray water during weaving. These problems have now been solved in Soviet factories. In the textile factory, there are machines that draw cotton fibers outward, and the ground is also very dry. The air in the cigarette factory is also particularly ventilated. What is especially touching is the service spirit of the medical staff in these factories. They patrol the workers' health next to the machines during non-working hours, and immediately treat the workers if they have any illnesses. The workers' residences in the factories are well-ventilated and fully equipped. At the same time, nurseries are generally established in each factory, and they can collectively watch plays every week. How happily the Soviet workers are working and living!

    In Gorky City, we visited the shipyard and the Molotov Automobile Factory. During the Patriotic War, the Hitler bandit army once surrounded the city. The workers here automatically organized themselves and, despite the enemy's frantic bombing and attacks, defended their factories like soldiers defending their positions, and worked day and night to manufacture a large number of tanks and artillery, supplying the Red Army to strike and annihilate the enemy. The workers of Gorky City thus consciously participated in the anti-German Patriotic War with tenacious labor and achieved high honors.

    After the victory of the Patriotic War, the Soviet people worked selflessly with even greater enthusiasm to restore the post-war national economy and complete the new five-year construction plan, and created many new records. Now, these factories produce a large number of motorcycles, trucks, steamships, or cranes every day, and the production rate is astonishing. The Molotov Automobile Factory produces a car every three minutes or two and a half minutes, and the shipbuilding volume of the Zhdanov Shipyard exceeds two and a half times that before the war.

    In the southern suburbs of Gorky City, we visited the Spark Collective Farm. The chairman of the collective farm received us with the most solemn etiquette. The production achievements of the collective farm are making rapid progress. The raising of livestock is done using the most scientific methods. For example, a cow in the past could grow up to a maximum of 1,000 catties, but now the largest cow can grow up to more than 1,800 catties. The Gorky Collective Farm has 120 dairy cows, which can produce 5,000 kilograms of milk annually. Taking care of livestock is also scientific. For example, 120 cows only require one person to take care of them. When the cow wants to drink water, the tap automatically flows out when its mouth touches the iron plate, and the tap automatically closes when the cow does not drink water. The pigs on the farm can be raised to 100 to 120 kilograms in weight. There used to be deaths when piglets were born, but now one large pig gives birth to 20 piglets, and the method of rotating breastfeeding enables them to survive. There have also been great improvements in sheep breeding. In the past, black sheep have been improved and many have now become white sheep. The weight of the sheep has increased, the physique is fatter, and the wool produced is also softer and longer. The increase in the number of sheep not only meets the needs of meat consumption, but also increases the value of wool and sheepskin in industrial manufacturing. The comrade who breeds the sheep has won the Stalin Prize. This farm has only 350 households and 900 people, but during the Soviet-German war, they could supply a regiment of the Soviet army with supplies.

    The members of the collective farm live very well. Each person can eat a pound of milk, two eggs, and four ounces of butter every day, as well as fruits, vegetables, etc. The equipment in the houses is also very perfect, with carpets on the ground, radios and flower pots on the tables, and spring beds to sleep on. In addition to schools, there are dance halls, racetracks, and other entertainment facilities in the village.

    On May 19th, we visited Leningrad, the heroic city that defended itself for 900 days during the Patriotic War. There, we visited the largest Soviet Youth Cultural Palace, which has a 35-kilometer children's railway, 327 rooms, and halls. These rooms are equipped with various teaching instruments and charts, as well as various lathes and models. There are 260 full-time teachers with various specialties, as well as hundreds of part-time teachers. Children use their spare time to carry out learning activities in the palace. According to statistics, there are now more than 16,000 young people participating in 760 various groups, and tens of thousands of young people are participating in temporary studies and various activities held by the Youth Palace. When I asked them what they wanted to do in the future, these children told me, "I want to be a good pilot, tanker, or engineer." In these beautiful surroundings, children cultivate their lofty ideals of defending the motherland and building communism from a young age.

    We left the Soviet Union on May 23rd. During this visit of less than a month, I gained a lot. Two months ago, when I was on the front lines in Korea, what I saw was: American imperialism implementing a criminal policy of destroying humanity, airplanes indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities and villages; wherever the enemy went, men were captured to serve as puppet soldiers, women were raped, people were displaced, and some innocent children were killed by the enemy and thrown on the roadside. This is the so-called "peace policy" of Truman. What I see today in the socialist Soviet Union is that, in order to defend world peace and create a more perfect and happy life for mankind, everyone is tensely engaged in peaceful production in a fighting posture. Everyone knows that tense labor is a fighting act to defend world peace, and the role they play is the core force to defend world peace.

    We must, under the inspiration of the Soviet people's great patriotism and internationalism, complete the sacred task entrusted to us by the people of our motherland. Seeing the beautiful and happy life of the Soviet people also gives us a vision of the future of our great motherland, which makes me love our motherland even more and hate our mortal enemy, American imperialism, even more. Under the banner of great patriotism and internationalism, as a volunteer soldier, I am full of confidence to work hard to complete the sacred task entrusted to us by the people of our motherland.

　　苏联人民热爱中国人民
　  ——赴苏参加“五一”节观礼观感
    中国人民志愿军战斗英雄　王有根
    此次我应中苏友好协会的邀请，到苏联去参加“五一”节观礼，我觉得非常光荣。
    四月十六日由首都北京动身，在沿途，苏联的每个车站都事先准备好了对我们热烈的欢迎，向我们献花欢呼。四月二十六日到达莫斯科，在车站接受了苏联代表热情的拥抱和献花。
    “五一”节，我们站在雄伟的莫斯科红场上观礼。早上九点开始，最先通过红场的是保卫世界和平强大力量——苏联各种兵种的队伍。这些队伍都是机械化装备，坦克是重型的，炮有“喀秋莎”炮、自动炮、榴弹炮、远射程炮，在坦克车身和大炮炮筒上写着消灭敌人的数字、参加重大战役的次数，及行程里数。空军人员通过红场时，空中飞过各种各样的飞机，巨型的空中堡垒、驱逐机、战斗机、喷气式飞机等。苏联的喷气式飞机比美国喷气式飞机快得多。从这点来看，苏联国防威力是任何国家赶不上的，帝国主义如果敢于冒险发动战争，结果是一定要失败的。
    将近十点左右，莫斯科市二十五个区游行队伍走近检阅台。苏联人民像热爱自己领袖一样的热爱中国人民领袖毛泽东同志，他们都高举着毛主席、朱总司令、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志画像，中国代表团自始至终成了游行者注目的中心。他们走到中国代表团面前，都极端兴奋地欢呼着：“毛泽东万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”“抗美援朝的英雄们万岁！”有的在鼓掌，摆手，把鲜花、帽子抛在半空中，走到中国代表团面前，甚至不愿走开了；有些骑在父亲肩头上的四、五岁的小孩子，他们也兴奋地直鼓着小掌，高呼“中国，乌啦！中国，乌啦！”志愿军代表和朝鲜人民军的代表更是最引人注意的人物，许多人特地走过来向我们致敬。观礼台上华西里·彼特罗夫少将特地走到中国代表团，与我和中国人民解放军代表何双进见面，紧紧握着我们的手。他注视着何双进同志胸前的纪念章，一面抚摩说：“这是华北解放纪念章，这是人民功臣纪念章，这是……”这是多么感动人的场面啊，全副戎装胸前挂满了勋章的中苏人民与世界人民的保卫者，在国际劳动者大团结的日子里，在红场上互祝胜利。
    游行者不断向中国代表团欢呼，投掷心爱的鲜花。我们也不顾雨淋，一直举着手，欢呼祝贺。年近七十的林老和七十七岁高龄的沈老也完全忘记疲劳，向游行队伍还礼。旁边费多洛夫同志说：“‘五一’节的摄影记者只要站在中国代表团前面，面对游行队伍取景，那就再好没有了。”“一切光荣花都给中国同志们带上了。”红场观礼最集中地表明了中苏人民伟大深厚的友谊。
    为什么苏联人民对我们表示这样的敬意和热爱呢？苏联将军华西里·彼特罗夫向我们说：“苏联人民对胜利了的中国人民英勇地支援朝鲜、保卫世界和平的伟大国际主义的行动非常敬佩，并向你们寄以十二万分的关怀和慰问。我能见到光荣的中国人民代表，我特别高兴。”
    苏联人民对中国人民抗美援朝运动是非常关切的，他们把苏联报纸上所登载的有关中国抗美援朝的文章、消息，剪下来作为自己的学习材料。每次宴会上，苏联同志都起立为“祝贺中国人民抗美援朝的胜利”而干杯。真理报记者更三番五次向我访问中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场的实况，并发表通讯登载于真理报显著地位。苏联人民热切关怀的行动，更鼓舞了我们的战斗意志。
    我们在莫斯科除观礼“五一”大检阅外，还参观了半个月。使我感动最深的是莫斯科苏联红军博物馆，里面陈设了很多苏联红军烈士的史迹：如苏德战争中，某次指挥部和前线电讯突然中断，一个通讯兵冒着炮火爬行着去检查电线，到了电线被炮火轰断的地方，他的两手已经受伤不能动作了，可是接线任务非常紧急，他努力用嘴把两根线头衔起，咬在一块，胜利地完成接线任务后而中电牺牲。为了纪念这位烈士，他当时所用的电线仍保存在红军博物馆里。还有在苏德战争中有一个团队坚守莫斯科附近的一个阵地，打的非常英勇，该团党的书记号召大家说：“后面就是莫斯科，不能退却！”他为了保护国家军旗，最后把军旗藏在贴身的衬衫里面，而壮烈牺牲。到一九四九年移灵，发掘出他的尸体，才发现了这面血染的军旗，现今保存在博物馆里，作为永久的纪念。红军博物馆里还有打死三百多敌人的步枪，枪把最后打断了，使用这枝步枪的英雄也光荣牺牲了。红军博物馆的参观给我一个深刻的教育，想到自己被人称赞的功绩，和这些英勇事迹相比，还很惭愧，我下决心一定要更加努力，向这些英雄们学习。
    我们又参观了莫斯科历史博物馆，这里面陈列了由猿猴变人各个历史阶段的化石。有一个保存古物的人，曾得到斯大林的奖金。苏联人民热爱自己祖国，他们对历史史迹的重视，保留古迹的精神也是值得我们学习的。
    在莫斯科我们还参观了农具工厂、纺织厂、制烟厂，这里面工人福利、卫生设备都十分完善，应有尽有。过去一般的制烟厂的工人易得心脏病，纺织厂棉花纤维到处飞，和织布时需要喷水，工人们易得支气管炎和关节炎，这些问题在苏联工厂现在都解决了。纺织厂里有把棉花纤维向外抽的机器，地面也很干燥，烟厂空气也特别流通。尤其使人感动的是这些工厂医务人员的服务精神，他们在非工作时间来回在机器旁边巡视工人健康，一遇到工人有疾病，连忙进行治疗。工厂里的工人住宅空气很流通，设备亦很齐全。同时每个工厂普遍设立托儿所，每星期都能集体看戏，苏联工人是多么幸福地在劳动着生活着啊！
    在高尔基城，我们参观了造船厂及莫洛托夫汽车厂。在卫国战争时期，希特勒匪军曾包围这城市，这里的工人都自动组织起来，冒着敌人疯狂轰炸与进攻，像战士坚守阵地一样，不仅保卫自己的工厂，而且日夜劳动，大量制造了坦克与大炮，供给红军打击和歼灭敌人。高尔基城的工人就这样自觉地以顽强的劳动参加了抗德卫国战争，取得了很高的荣誉。
    卫国战争胜利以后，苏联人民以更强烈的热情为恢复战后的国民经济和完成新的五年建设计划而忘我地劳动着，并创造出许多新纪录。现在这些工厂里，每天要生产出大量的摩托车、大卡车、汽船、或是起重机等，生产率是惊人的。莫洛托夫汽车厂达到三分钟或两分半钟出一部汽车，日丹诺夫造船厂的造船量超过战前的二倍半。
    我们在高尔基城南郊，参观了火花集体农庄，集体农庄主席以最隆重的礼节来接待了我们。集体农庄的生产成绩在飞跃地进步着。饲养牲畜都用最科学的方法，如一条牛过去最多能长到一千斤，现在最大的牛能长到一千八百多斤。高尔基集体农庄有一百二十条母牛，每年能出五千公斤牛奶。看管牲畜都科学化了，如一百二十条牛，只要一个人看管。牛要喝水时，嘴一接触到铁板，板子一跷自来水就自动流出，牛不喝水自来水就自动关上了。农庄里的猪能养到一百至一百二十公斤重，过去生小猪时还有死亡，现一个大猪生二十只小猪，采用轮流喝奶办法能使它们都活下去。羊群配种方面亦有很大改进，过去黑色羊经过改良现在很多变成白羊，羊的体重增加，体质更肥，所产的羊毛也更柔更长了。羊群数目的增多除供给肉食需用之外，羊毛、羊皮业在工业制造上的价值也提高。这个配羊的同志曾获得斯大林奖金。这个农庄只有三百五十户，九百个人，可是他们在苏德战争中能供给苏军一团人的给养。
    集体农庄的庄员们，生活是很富裕的。每人每天能吃一磅牛奶，两个鸡蛋，四两牛油，还有：水果、蔬菜等等。房屋里设备也很完美，地上普遍有地毯，桌上摆着收音机、花盆，睡的是弹簧床，庄子里除学校外有跳舞厅、跑马场等娱乐设备。
    五月十九日，我们参观了在卫国战争中曾保卫了九百天的英雄城市列宁格勒，在那里我们参观了苏联最巨大的一座少年文化宫，它拥有一条三十五公里的儿童铁道，有三百二十七间房屋和大厅。这些房间中装置各种教学仪器和图表，还有各种车床和模型。这里有二百六十个各种专长的专职教员，还有数百个兼职教员，儿童们利用课余时间在宫中进行学习活动。据统计：现有一万六千多个少年，参加七百六十个各种小组，还有数万个少年参加少年宫所举行临时性的学习和各种活动。当我问他们你们将来做什么？这些儿童告诉我说：“我要做个好的飞行员、坦克手、工程师。”儿童们在这些优美环境里，很小就培养了他们保卫祖国、建设共产主义的远大理想。
    我们是在五月二十三号离开苏联的。在这不到一个月的参观过程中，我的收获很大。两个月以前，当我在朝鲜前线的时候，我所看到的是：美帝国主义执行毁灭人类的罪恶政策，飞机到处滥炸和平的城市和乡村；敌人所到的地方，男的被抓去当伪军，女的被强奸，流离失所，更有些无辜的儿童被敌人杀死抛在路旁，这就是所谓杜鲁门的“和平政策”。今天所见到的社会主义苏联，为了保卫世界和平，为了创造人类更美满的幸福生活，每个人以战斗的姿态紧张地进行着和平生产，他们每人都知道紧张的劳动，就是保卫世界和平的战斗行为，他们所发挥的作用，就是保卫世界和平的核心力量。
    我们要在苏联人民伟大的爱国主义与国际主义的鼓舞下，完成祖国人民所交给我们的神圣任务。看到苏联人民美满幸福的生活，也就展望了我们伟大的祖国的将来，这使我更加热爱我们的祖国，更加仇视我们的死敌美帝国主义。在伟大爱国主义与国际主义旗帜下，作为一个志愿军战士，我信心百倍地努力完成祖国人民所交给我们的神圣任务。
