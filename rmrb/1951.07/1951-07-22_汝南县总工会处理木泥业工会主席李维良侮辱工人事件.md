Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

To the Editors:

    The People's Daily published a criticism on June 18 regarding Li Weiliang, chairman of the Runan County Wood and Mud Industry Union, for insulting workers and losing his class standpoint. Chen Dongshu, the organization director of the Runan County Federation of Trade Unions, bears the primary responsibility for this serious incident. This incident also demonstrates the serious bureaucratic style of leadership within the County Federation of Trade Unions. We are now reporting the details of this incident and the results of the handling of it as follows:

    The three workers who were insulted were all mobilized from the countryside by the district and township governments to build houses for a logistics department of a certain military region. When the district and township cadres mobilized them to work in the city, they originally said the term would only be five or six days, and they would definitely not be delayed from harvesting wheat. However, the workers had already worked for ten days, the rural areas had begun harvesting wheat, and their work tasks had not yet been completed. The three carpenters, Qiao Wanchun, Zhang Daoli, and Wei Tinglin, thinking of returning home to harvest wheat, and also due to eye problems, or family members being ill, etc., ran back home without obtaining approval for leave. After the construction management office of the military region's logistics department called these three workers back from the countryside, they handed these three workers over to Li Weiliang and suggested having these three workers wear tall hats and parade through the streets. At the time, Li Weiliang was afraid to make a decision on his own, so he found Chen Dongshu, the organization director of the County Federation of Trade Unions (the County Federation of Trade Unions had assigned Chen Dongshu to be responsible for leading the union work of the entire construction area for this military region's logistics department's housing construction). Chen Dongshu, without any consideration, agreed to forcibly order the workers to parade through the streets. Before the workers paraded through the streets, Li Weiliang went to Chen Dongshu for instructions once more, and Chen Dongshu still replied: "Just let them parade, we'll study it after something goes wrong."

    Chen Dongshu never asked for instructions or reported on this matter before or after it occurred. When the leadership discovered this matter and inquired with him, his attitude was also very dishonest, not only not exposing his own mistakes but also exaggerating the mistakes on the part of the insulted workers.

    Li Weiliang is a new cadre who has only recently left production, and his political level is relatively poor. He consulted Chen Dongshu twice before the workers paraded through the streets, so Chen Dongshu should bear the primary responsibility for this matter. Chen Dongshu has now been removed from his position as organization director, and a report with recommendations has been submitted to the higher authorities for handling.

    In addition to making a self-criticism and apologizing to all the workers at a general meeting, Li Weiliang has also been removed from his position as chairman of the Wood and Mud Industry Union.

          Runan County Federation of Trade Unions, Henan Province

    Editor's Note: The Runan County Federation of Trade Unions in Henan Province has attached importance to the matter of union cadres infringing on human rights and insulting workers in the area and has put forward suggestions for handling the personnel involved, which is appropriate. However, this handling opinion does not specifically analyze the causes of the error, and therefore has failed to formulate methods for correcting the error. It is hoped that the Runan County Federation of Trade Unions will seize this matter to further examine and study it, educate cadres, and improve its work.

### 汝南县总工会处理木泥业工会主席李维良侮辱工人事件

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    汝南县总工会处理木泥业工会主席李维良侮辱工人事件编辑同志：
    六月十八日人民日报发表了对我县木泥业联合工会主席李维良侮辱工人，丧失阶级立场的批评。这一严重事件，汝南县总工会组织部长陈东曙应负主要责任。这一事件也说明了县总工会领导方面的官僚主义作风是严重的。现在把这一事件的经过和处理结果报告如下：
    被侮辱的三个工人都是经过区乡政府从农村动员来为某军区后勤部修建房舍的。区乡干部动员他们进城工作时，原说只有五、六天的期限，决不耽误收麦。但是工人们已做了十天工，农村已开始收割小麦，他们的工作任务还没有完成。木工乔万春、张道理、魏廷林三人，因为想着回家收割麦子，又加上自己害眼病，或家里有人生病等原因，在请假不获批准后就自己跑回去了。军区后勤部的修建管理处把这三个工友从乡下叫回来以后，就把这三个工友交给李维良，并提出让这三位工友戴高帽子游街的意见。当时李维良不敢作主，他就找到县总工会组织部长陈东曙（县总工会曾指派陈东曙负责领导这次军区后勤部修建房舍全工区的工会工作），陈东曙竟不加考虑，同意强令工人去游街。李维良在工人游街前又去向陈东曙请示了一次，陈东曙仍答复说：“游就游吧，错了事后再研究。”
    此事发生前后陈东曙始终没有请示报告。领导上发现这件事情向他询问时，他的态度也还很不老实，不但不暴露自己的错误，反而夸大被侮辱的工人方面的错处。
    李维良是一个脱离生产不久的新干部，政治水平比较差，在工人游街前曾两次请示陈东曙，因此这件事情应由陈东曙负主要责任。现在已将陈东曙的组织部长职务撤销，并提出意见报告上级处理中。
    李维良除作了检讨又在大会上向全体工人道歉以外，并已被撤销木泥业联合工会主席的职务。
          河南省汝南县总工会
    编者按：河南省汝南县总工会已重视该地工会干部侵犯人权，侮辱工人的事情，并提出对有关人员的处理意见，这是应该的。但是这个处理意见，没有具体分析发生错误的原因，因此也就未能订出纠正错误的办法。希望汝南县总工会抓紧这件事情进一步检查研究，教育干部，改进工作。
