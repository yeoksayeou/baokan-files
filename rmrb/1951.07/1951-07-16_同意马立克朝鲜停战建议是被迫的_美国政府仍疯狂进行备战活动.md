　　Agreeing to Malik's Korean Armistice Proposal Was Forced
    The US Government Is Still Frantically Engaging in War Preparations
    The American people oppose war plans; this is the reason the US government is creating various excuses in the Korean negotiations to maintain an atmosphere of war.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] The US government, while negotiating the Korean armistice, has not relaxed its pursuit of its war preparations plans in the slightest; however, as in the past, it is encountering many difficulties.
    After accepting the Korean armistice negotiation proposal, Truman explicitly declared in a speech on July 4 that the basic policy of the United States is: even if the Korean War stops, the United States "must continue to rapidly expand our military strength, and we must continue to help other free nations build their defenses."
    Heads of all aspects of the US government, including Secretary of State Acheson, Secretary of Defense Marshall, Director of the Defense Mobilization Agency Wilson, and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Vinson, also unanimously clamored in their recent speeches, reports, or statements that regardless of the outcome of the Korean armistice negotiations, the United States must never relax its expansion of armaments. In his second-quarter report on mobilization work, Wilson rebuked those who, in view of the Korean armistice negotiations, advocated reducing the US armed forces to three million. He emphasized that "the American people still need to make at least two years of strenuous efforts."
    According to the above-mentioned established policy, the Truman administration has recently successively formulated a series of plans to increase war preparation expenditures. The so-called "Mutual Security Program" recently submitted to Congress requests an appropriation of 8.5 billion US dollars for US vassal states to expand their military forces. This plan is still under discussion in Congress. At the beginning of last month, Truman signed a supplementary military expenditure appropriation of 6.45 billion US dollars. Subsequently, on June 20, Marshall requested Congress to allocate an additional 6.56 billion US dollars for military expenditure. The next day, Truman requested an additional 535 million US dollars for so-called "civil defense" expenses. The US military budget for 1951-52 has increased to more than 66.5 billion US dollars.
    However, what makes these war-mongering figures worried are the serious difficulties in implementing the war preparation plan. In his report, Wilson could not but admit that even though the production of important civilian durable goods such as automobiles and refrigerators has been reduced by one-third compared to before the Korean War, the military production plan has only completed 80 percent of its original target. He also had to admit that rapid inflation has greatly reduced the value of the military expenditure that has already been allocated. In the first year of the Korean War, the currency spent on purchasing weapons and supplies due to inflation reached 7 billion US dollars. The shortage of manpower is also very obvious. In order to recruit 1.5 million new workers, it is now necessary to consider employing women, retirees, and even the disabled. Wilson admitted that the major difficulties the United States faces in this regard are "the lack of skilled workers, technical workers, scientific workers, and machine tools."
    The greater difficulty is the American people's opposition to the US government's war plans. This is the reason why the heads of the US government are doing their utmost to clamor for continued war preparations in the Korean negotiations. Observers believe this is also the reason why the US government is using various excuses in the Korean negotiations to create negotiation difficulties in order to maintain an atmosphere of war.

### 同意马立克朝鲜停战建议是被迫的  美国政府仍疯狂进行备战活动

　　同意马立克朝鲜停战建议是被迫的
    美国政府仍疯狂进行备战活动
    美国人民反对战争计划，这是美国政府在朝鲜谈判中制造各种借口以保持战争空气的原因。
    【新华社十五日讯】在谈判朝鲜停战中的美国政府，并没有丝毫放松推行它的备战计划；但是，和过去一样，它正遭遇到许多困难。
    杜鲁门在接受朝鲜停战谈判建议以后，在七月四日的一次演说中，曾明确地宣告，美国的基本方针是：即使朝鲜战争停止，美国仍然“必须继续迅速扩充我们的军事力量，而且我们必须继续帮助其他自由国家建立它们的防务”。
    美国政府各方面的首脑，包括国务卿艾奇逊、国防部长马歇尔、国防动员署长威尔生、最高法院院长文生等，也在他们最近的演说、报告或声明中，一致叫嚣不管朝鲜停战谈判结果如何，美国绝不能放松扩充军备。威尔生在他的动员工作的第二季报告中责骂了那些鉴于朝鲜停战谈判而主张把美国武装部队减少到三百万的人。他强调“美国人民至少还需要作两年的紧张努力”。
    按照上述既定的方针，杜鲁门政府新近接二连三地定出了一串增加战争准备经费的计划。新近在国会提出的所谓“共同安全计划”，要求拨款八十五亿美元供美国仆从国家扩军之用。这个计划仍在国会讨论中。上月初，杜鲁门签署了一项六十四亿五千万美元的补充军费拨款。接着，马歇尔又在六月二十日向国会要求增拨六十五亿六千万美元作军费，第二天，杜鲁门又要求增拨五亿三千五百万美元的所谓“民防”费。美国一九五一——五二年度的军事预算，已增加至六百六十五亿美元以上。
    但是，使得这些战争贩子头痛的，是执行备战计划中的严重的困难。威尔生在他的报告中就不能不承认，即使汽车、冰箱之类重要民用耐用物品的生产，比较朝鲜战争之前已削减了三分之一，而军备生产计划仍只完成了原定目标的百分之八十。他也不得不承认，急剧的通货膨胀使已拨出的军费大打折扣。在朝鲜战争的头一年内，由于通货膨胀而多花于购买武器和供应品的货币就达七十亿美元。人力的不足也十分明显，为了征集一百五十万新工人，现在必须考虑雇用妇女、退休者以至残废者了。威尔生承认，美国在这方面的重大困难是“熟练工人、技术工人、科学工人以及工作母机的缺少”。
    更大的困难是美国人民反对美国政府的战争计划。这是美国政府首脑在朝鲜谈判中竭力叫嚣继续备战的原因。观察家认为这也是美国政府在朝鲜谈判中利用各种借口制造谈判困难以保持战争空气的原因。
