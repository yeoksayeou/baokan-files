　　Objective Difficulties Exist
　　But Are Not the Fundamental Issue
　　——A Discussion with Comrade Xiao Cheng on Basic Construction

To the Editor:

　　After reading Comrade Xiao Cheng's letter published in the People's Daily on July 24th, I believe that the objective difficulties he listed do indeed exist in basic construction work. His suggestions are very good and will be helpful in improving basic construction work. However, it is not quite appropriate to equate these objective difficulties with design problems and treat them as essential issues. Moreover, the objective difficulties listed by Comrade Xiao Cheng are fundamentally inseparable from incorrect design and unsound construction plans.

　　First, let us examine the issue of "budget approval being delayed again and again." From the materials I have come across in my work, the main responsibility should be borne by the budget-making institutions. Last year, two factories built large-scale repair workshops without approval (the production capacity far exceeded their own needs). They first used production funds for construction, and when the money was not enough, they applied to higher authorities for funds. The higher authorities naturally had to carefully review their budgets. Because the state did not give them the task of expanding repair workshops, and they themselves did not have a thorough design (one factory's repair workshop was already built, but they had no idea what machines to install inside, so the director of the repair department went to the Shanghai market to look and buy). The higher authorities did not approve their budgets, and as a result, both projects were forced to stop. Similar situations are not uncommon. Should the budget-approving authorities be responsible for this?

　　Another factory needed to add a certain type of production equipment, and the state approved this request. However, when it came to the technical design, the comrade in charge of this factory did not honestly proceed from reality, but wanted the newly added production equipment to not only be able to produce but also to be "modernized" and "impressive." As for how to obtain the materials necessary for "modernization" and "impressiveness" within the time limit set by the higher authorities for completing the task, he neglected to consider it. The budget made based on such a design not only greatly exceeded the control figures stipulated by the state, but also had many materials that could not be bought on the market at all, so they had to redesign. This project was expected to be completed in four months, but the design was revised three times, taking up one month. In order to save time, the budget was not prepared according to the final technical design, but was "created" by an engineer. The leading comrade clearly said: "Report it quickly, get the money first!" The budget-approving authorities must be responsible to the people and cannot ignore the interests of the people because of the "construction enthusiasm" of lower-level organs. Therefore, such a "budget" that is "reported quickly" as a certificate for receiving money should naturally be investigated and studied before a decision is made. This is another reason for "budget approval being delayed again and again." As for the budget approval situation mentioned by Comrade Xiao Cheng, I am afraid it is an individual phenomenon. As far as I know, those who generally review engineering budgets are relatively experienced experts, and they are quite cautious when reviewing.

　　Secondly, regarding the supply of materials, this is a problem that must be considered during design, especially in our country where the level of industrial production is relatively low and many important materials still have to rely on imports. If the source of materials is not fully considered during design, then the risk of not being able to realize the plan is hidden! After having a correct design, when preparing the construction plan, it is not only necessary to "take care of the difficulties in the procurement of materials by the supply department" in principle and give what is subjectively considered "a longer preparation time," but also to specifically study what difficulties there are in the procurement of certain materials, what methods can be used to solve these difficulties, how much time is needed to solve them, and a series of other issues, and to estimate the worst possible situation before determining the preparation period, which is more reliable.

　　Design errors can directly cause untimely supply. We know that advanced technical norms must be considered when designing; otherwise, mistakes will be made during construction. For example, bricklaying used to be 270 bricks per person per day. After liberation, the workers' class consciousness was raised, and they gave play to their production enthusiasm, laying 500 bricks per person per day. If this factor is not considered in the design, and the labor plan and material supply plan are still made according to 270 bricks per person per day, the phenomenon of work stoppage and waiting for materials will inevitably occur!

　　Thirdly, regarding the issue of manufacturers not abiding by contracts, if the design is correct, then the inspection should start from the construction plan. Comrade Xiao Cheng listed two manufacturers who violated the contract. This should be taken into account when preparing the construction plan and determining the order deadline, and one cannot rely solely on subjective wishes, but must conduct an investigation and study of the manufacturer's production capacity, and the contract must stipulate penalties for breach of contract. A better way is not to order directly from the manufacturers, but for everyone to order through the Industry and Commerce Bureau or the trade association, which can strengthen the state's leadership over the production plans of private merchants, thereby reducing many troubles of not abiding by contracts.

　　In short, we must overcome the thoughts of "liking to be grand and seeking quick results" and engage in basic construction with a spirit of high responsibility to the people, grasp the most basic and important link - correct design, make construction plans based on this design, and act according to the plan meticulously, then many major errors can be basically avoided. As for some objective difficulties, as long as we are willing to work hard to think of ways and create and accumulate experience in the work process, they can be gradually overcome.

### 客观困难是有的  但不是基本问题——与萧成同志讨论基本建设

　　客观困难是有的
　  但不是基本问题
　  ——与萧成同志讨论基本建设编辑同志：
    读了七月二十四日人民日报发表的萧成同志的信，我认为他所列举的那些客观困难，在基本建设工作中确实存在着。他的意见很好，对基本建设工作的改进是会有帮助的。但是，如果把这些客观困难和设计问题等量齐观，也作为本质问题来看待，则不很恰当；而且，萧成同志所列举的客观困难，基本上还是与设计不正确、施工计划不健全分不开的。
    首先，让我们来研究“预算批示迟了又迟”的问题。从我在工作中接触到的材料来看，主要责任是应该由编预算的机构来负的。去年有两个工厂未经批准建设了大规模的修理车间（生产能力远超过他们自己的需要），先用生产资金进行建筑，后来钱不够了，便向上级请款；上级机关自然要详细审核他们的预算。因为国家没有给他们扩充修理车间的建设任务，他们自己也没有周密的设计（其中一个厂的修理厂房都建筑好了，里面要装什么机器还没谱儿，由修理部主任到上海市场上去看着买）。上级不批准他们的预算，结果是两个工程都被迫停下来。类似这样的情形是不少的，难道应该由批预算的机关负责吗？
    另外一个工厂，需要增加一种生产设备，国家批准了这个要求；可是当作技术设计时，这个工厂的负责同志不是老老实实从实际出发，而是想新增加的生产设备不但要能生产，而且还要“近代化”，“像样儿”。至于“近代化”和“像样儿”所必需的器材如何在上级规定的完成任务的期限内得到，他却忽略了。根据这样的设计作出来的预算，不但大大超过了国家规定的控制数字，而且有许多器材在市场上根本无法买到，结果只好重作设计。这个工程预计用四个月的期限完成，设计返工三次，用去一个月的时间。为了赶时间，预算不是按最后的技术设计编制，而是由一位工程师“造”出来的。领导同志曾明白地说：“快点报上去吧，先拿到钱再说！”批预算的机关是要对人民负责任的，不能因为下级机关的“建设热情”就忽视了人民的利益。那末，对这样“快点报上去”作为领钱凭证的“预算”，自然应该作一番调查研究然后再作决定。这是“预算批示迟了又迟”的另一种原因。至于萧成同志所说的批预算的情形，恐怕是个别现象。据我所知，一般审查工程预算的，都是比较有经验的专家，而且审查时是相当慎重的。
    其次，关于器材供应，这是设计时必须考虑的问题，尤其是在工业生产水平比较低，许多重要器材还不得不依靠进口的我国，如果设计时不充分考虑器材的来源，那就蕴藏下使计划不能实现的危险！有了正确的设计以后，编制施工计划时，就不仅要有原则地“照顾到供应部门器材购置的困难”，给予主观上认为“较长准备的时间”，而是要具体地研究某项器材购置有什么困难，有那些可以解决这些困难的办法，需要多少时间才能解决等一系列问题，把最坏的可能都估计在内，然后确定准备期限，才是比较可靠的。
    设计错误，可以直接造成供应不及时。我们知道，设计时是要考虑先进技术定额这一因素的；不然，在施工中就会犯错误。例如砌砖，过去是一人一天砌二百七十块，解放后工人的阶级觉悟提高，发挥了生产积极性，一人一天砌五百块了，设计时如不考虑这个因素，仍按每人每天砌二百七十块作劳动计划和物资供应计划，结果必然会发生停工等料的现象！
    第三，关于厂商不遵守合同问题，如果设计是正确的，则应从施工计划来着手检查。萧成同志列举了两家违背合同的厂商，这是应当在编制施工计划、决定订货期限时，就不能单凭主观愿望，而必需对厂商的生产能力作一番调查研究，而且在合同中要规定违约的罚则。较好的办法是不直接向厂商订货，大家都通过工商局或同业公会订货，则可加强国家对私商生产计划的领导，从而也可减少许多不遵守合同的麻烦。
    总之，我们要克服“好大喜功”和“急于求成”的思想，以对人民高度负责的精神来从事基本建设，捉住最基本、最重要的环节——设计正确，根据这设计来订施工计划，一丝不苟地按计划办事，则许多重大错误基本上是可以避免的。至于一些客观困难，只要我们肯努力想办法，在工作过程中创造和积累经验，是可以逐步克服的。
