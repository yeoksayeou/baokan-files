Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd—Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram on June 29th to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council, protesting the abduction of hundreds of thousands of residents from northern Korea by the U.S. aggressor troops and the Lee Seung-man gangsters to the southern regions, where they were subjected to cruel persecution and slaughter, and coerced into sending young people and children to engage in espionage and sabotage activities behind the lines of the Korean People's Army.

The telegram stated: Despite the indignation of world public opinion at the atrocities committed by the interventionists in Korea, the United Nations has ignored the protests of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the result that these atrocities continue to gradually expand.

The telegram pointed out: In December 1950, when the interventionist troops retreated, the U.S. military headquarters, seeing that the plan to occupy northern Korea had failed, ordered the areas to be turned into ruins; and in order to weaken the strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ordered the residents to be abducted to the southern regions. Under the deception, threats, and coercion of the U.S. aggressors, hundreds of thousands of residents of North Korea were abducted to the southern regions, most of whom died en route due to hunger, cold, disease, and the bombing and strafing by U.S. air bandits; those who survived were forcibly sent to special "refugee" camps run by the Americans.

The telegram pointed out: According to reliable information obtained by the Korean government, there are 77 such camps in South Chungcheong Province alone, housing 908,834 people abducted from northern Korea. In addition, the U.S. and Lee gangs have established 160 camps on Jeju Island and seven camps on Geoje Island, housing 82,406 people.

The telegram stated: The residents of northern Korea are subjected to cruel persecution in the camps and are being systematically slaughtered. The living conditions in the camps are unbearably difficult. The prisoners are starving. Due to the lack of necessary medical facilities, infectious diseases such as paratyphoid, typhoid, smallpox, and diphtheria are rampant in the camps. According to the information we have obtained, in the aforementioned camps, 374,097 people were ill in April of this year, and on April 7 alone, 2,765 people died.

The telegram went on to expose that the U.S. and Lee Seung-man intelligence agencies force men aged 18 to 40 to leave their families, train them, and organize armed teams, sabotage groups, and reconnaissance groups to be sent behind the lines of the People's Army. The U.S. and Lee gangs threaten them that if they do not obey, their families will be killed. In addition, the U.S. interventionists even force the children of the people abducted from northern Korea to participate in espionage and sabotage operations.

The telegram concluded: In light of the above, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demands that foreign armed intervention in Korea be stopped; that the war criminals who should be held responsible for the atrocities committed against the Korean people be brought to trial; and that the non-combatant residents of northern Korea who have been forcibly abducted be returned.

　　美李匪军掳走大批朝鲜北部居民
    朝外相致电联大抗议
    并要求审判制造罪行的战犯
    【新华社平壤二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于六月二十九日致电联合国大会主席与安全理事会主席，抗议美国侵略军和李承晚匪军把朝鲜北部数十万居民掳往南部地区、施以残酷迫害和屠杀、并胁迫其中的青年和儿童到朝鲜人民军后方进行特务破坏活动。
    电文称：尽管世界舆论对干涉者在朝鲜的暴行表示激愤；但是，联合国无视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的抗议，以致这种暴行仍在继续逐渐扩大着。
    电文指出：一九五○年十二月，当干涉者的军队撤退时，美军司令部鉴于侵占朝鲜北部的计划已经破产，曾下令将撤退的地区变为废墟；并且为了削弱朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的力量，而下令将居民掳到南部地区去。在美国侵略者的欺骗、威胁和强迫下，北朝鲜的数十万居民被掳往南部地区，其中大部分在途中因饥寒、疾病和美国空中强盗的轰炸、扫射而死亡；幸免于死的人，则被强迫送入美国人的所谓“难民”特别收容所。
    电文指出：根据朝鲜政府所获得的可靠材料，仅忠清南道就有七十七个收容所，那里有九十万八千八百三十四名从朝鲜北部掳去的人。此外，美、李匪帮还在济州岛设立了一百六十个收容所；在巨济岛设立了收容着八万二千四百零六人的七处收容所。
    电文称：朝鲜北部的居民在收容所里遭受着残酷的迫害，并且被有组织地屠杀着。收容所里的生活条件是困难得无法忍受的。被囚禁的人都饿着肚子。因为没有必要的医疗设施，收容所里蔓延着副伤寒、伤寒、天花及白喉等传染病。根据我们所获得的材料，在上述收容所里，今年四月间有三十七万四千零九十七名患病者，仅在四月七日一天，就有二千七百六十五人死亡。
    电文继揭露美国及李承晚的谍报机关强迫十八岁到四十岁的男子离开他们的家属，施以训练，组织派往人民军后方的武装队、破坏团和侦探团。美李匪帮威胁他们，如果不听话，就杀死他们的家属。此外，美国干涉者甚至强迫从朝鲜北部抓去的人民的儿童参加侦探和破坏行动。
    电文最后说：根据上述情况，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求制止外国武装对朝鲜的干涉；将应该对朝鲜人民所犯暴行负责任的战争罪犯，提交审判；并将被强迫掳走的朝鲜北部的非战斗居民送回。
