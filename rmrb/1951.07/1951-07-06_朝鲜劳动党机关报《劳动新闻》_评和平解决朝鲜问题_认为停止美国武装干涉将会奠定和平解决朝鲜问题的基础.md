Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: The Korean Workers' Party organ, "Rodong Sinmun," published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "The First Step Towards a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue," stating: The Korean people resolutely oppose foreign armed intervention in Korea and firmly advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The joint statement issued by General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, once again demonstrates this will of our people.

The editorial pointed out: The Korean people, who embarked on the path of peaceful and democratic development in August 1945, have dedicated all their efforts to establishing a free, independent, and unified Korean nation through peaceful means; they have continuously struggled to improve and develop their economy, science, and culture. However, the US imperialists oppose the unification, independence, and democracy of Korea. They have drastically delayed the withdrawal of their troops from Korea, maintained the anti-popular rule of Syngman Rhee, equipped the South Korean puppet army, directed it to launch a "northward expedition" civil war, and directly engaged in armed intervention. The American aggressors attempted to occupy the entire territory of Korea with blitzkrieg tactics, enslave the Korean people, and transform Korea into a military base for the United States to expand its aggression in the Far East. However, the Korean people, supported by all progressive humanity in their just war, dealt a decisive blow to the armed interventionists and the Syngman Rhee gang. The result of the Korean people's one-year war for the liberation of their homeland clearly demonstrates the military and political failure of the armed interventionists.

The editorial pointed out: Due to the failure of the US imperialists' military adventure in Korea and the pressure of world democratic public opinion, the US ruling clique was forced to instruct its Far East Commander to propose a ceasefire and armistice to the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army. The editorial stated: The Korean people's agreement to this proposal once again demonstrates the Korean people's ardent desire to stop foreign armed intervention and establish peace on Korean territory.

The editorial concluded: The Korean people believe that if a ceasefire and armistice can be achieved, it will make the establishment of peace in the Far East possible and will make a great contribution to preventing a new world war. If US armed intervention in Korea is stopped, it will lay the foundation for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    评和平解决朝鲜问题
    认为停止美国武装干涉将会奠定和平解决朝鲜问题的基础
    【新华社平壤五日电】朝鲜劳动党机关报《劳动新闻》三日以《和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步》为题，发表社论说：朝鲜人民是坚决反对外国武装对朝鲜的干涉，坚决主张和平解决朝鲜问题的。朝鲜人民军总司令金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军所联名发表的声明，又一次地表明我们人民的这种意志。
    社论指出：从一九四五年八月走上和平民主发展道路的朝鲜人民，为了用和平方式达成自由、独立、统一的朝鲜国家的建立，而献出了所有的力量；为提高和发展自己的经济、科学、文化而进行了不断的斗争。但是，美帝国主义者反对朝鲜的统一、独立、民主，它极力拖延了它的军队撤出朝鲜的时日，保持了李承晚反人民的统治，装备了南朝鲜伪军，指使它发动了“北伐”的内战，并直接进行武装干涉。美国侵略者企图以速战速决的战术占领朝鲜全部领土，以奴役朝鲜人民，并变朝鲜为美国在远东扩大侵略的军事基地。但是，在正义战争中受到全体进步人类支持的朝鲜人民，给了武装干涉者和李承晚匪帮以决定性的打击。朝鲜人民一年来进行祖国解放战争的结果，清楚地说明了武装干涉者在军事、政治上的失败。
    社论指出：由于美帝国主义对朝鲜的军事冒险的失败，由于世界民主舆论的压力，美国统治集团不得已而指示它的远东军司令，向朝鲜人民军总司令部提出关于停火与休战的建议。社论说：朝鲜人民同意这一提议，再一次表明了朝鲜人民要在朝鲜领土上制止外国武装干涉、建立和平的热望。
    社论最后说：朝鲜人民认为停火和休战如能实现，将使远东和平的建立成为可能，对于防止新的世界大战的事业，将有很大的贡献。美国对朝鲜的武装干涉如被停止，将会奠定和平解决朝鲜问题的基础。
