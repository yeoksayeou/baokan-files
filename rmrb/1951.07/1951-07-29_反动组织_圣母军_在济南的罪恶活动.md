The imperialist tool of aggression, the reactionary "Legion of Mary," is fundamentally not a religious group, but a secret reactionary organization that uses Catholicism as a cover to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. The "Legion of Mary" directly harms the interests of the Chinese people and patriotic Catholics; this is fully confirmed by the heinous activities of the "Legion of Mary" in Jinan.

The "Legion of Mary" in Jinan was formed with American and Chiang Kai-shek Agents as its Backbone

The "Legion of Mary," also known as the "Servants of Mary" or the "Legion of Mary of Perpetual Adoration," is a secret reactionary organization within Catholicism with international connections. On September 9, 1950, Xiao Yongxin of the Tianjin branch of the "Legion of Mary," under the orders of Chen Zhemin, secretary to the imperialist element Li Peili, came to Jinan to secretly organize the "Legion of Mary." It initially appeared under the name "Legion of Mary of Perpetual Adoration." They first formed two branches, "Mother of Divine Grace" in the Jingwu Road Catholic Church and "Tower of David" in the Ruose Hospital, and vigorously developed the organization. Later, they organized four district councils, "Queen of Heaven and Earth," "Mother of All Nations," "Lovely Mother," and "Queen of Martyrs," with jurisdiction over twenty branches, developing more than 300 "members." In March of this year, under the manipulation and instigation of imperialist elements, a "Senior District Council" was established to uniformly lead the four district councils. Within these organizations, the "Legion of Mary" extensively recruited counter-revolutionaries as its backbone. For example, Zhao Ziping and Liu Jingshan, secret agents in the "Shandong People's Salvation Corps," which was jointly organized by international spy Lei Zhenyuan and Chiang Kai-shek's "Bureau of Confidential Information," served as district council spiritual directors, and Fan Bujie served as district president. Li Tonghua, a Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang secret agent, and others served as district vice presidents. They all used missionary work as a guise to secretly develop the "Legion of Mary" organization and carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities.

Spreading Rumors and Sabotage, Consistently Carrying Out Reactionary Propaganda

When the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were jointly resisting the American aggressors on the Korean front, the leading figures of the "Legion of Mary" wantonly spread rumors and carried out sabotage. Ke Shude and Wu Side, imperialist elements lurking in Liming Middle School, told "members" and students: "World War III is about to begin. American weapons are good and they will win." They also frequently listened to and spread "Voice of America."

The "Legion of Mary" actively disseminated anti-Soviet and anti-Communist fallacies to its "members" and conducted reactionary education. The organizers of the "Legion of Mary" told "members": "This is a time of disaster, a time to test us. Pray more and ask the 'Holy Mother' to make this disaster pass quickly." "Catholicism is light, and the Communist Party is darkness. Light and darkness are eternally incompatible." This spring, they slandered the People's Republic of China in their sermons, saying: "China has reached its most dangerous moment. Catholics must rely on Catholicism to increase their courage and fight against this demonic world," and maliciously insulted the Soviet Union, inciting discord in Sino-Soviet friendly relations.

In addition, the "Legion of Mary" actively distributed reactionary propaganda materials among "members" and the masses, such as the extremely reactionary "National Bishops' Statement," "Study Reference," and "Modern Question and Answer," and held meetings to disseminate and explain them.

Undermining the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, Obstructing Patriotic Actions of Young Students

When the people of the city launched the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country movement, the "Legion of Mary" did everything possible to carry out sabotage activities, especially obstructing young students from joining military cadre schools and preventing students from joining the New Democratic Youth League. The organizers of the "Legion of Mary" in Jinan, when assigning "tasks" to their "members" in the winter of 1950, said: "Our work focus is on the students of Liming Middle School. We must try to prevent the students from being deceived by the 'devils' (falsely referring to the Communist Party)." They sent their trusted henchmen to win over the parents of Yang Yubao, chairman of the Liming Middle School Student Union, saying: "Yang Yubao is very smart. If he can be enthusiastic about serving the church, the church will provide him with schooling in the future. But he is not enthusiastic now, so you must pay attention!" The branch secretary of the "Legion of Mary," Liu Xigeng, was instructed to use the slanderous and deceptive method of "go to church more and don't be deceived by the 'devils'" to win over young students such as Yu Guangzhi. The imperialist element Ke Shude also directly obstructed the patriotic actions of young students - joining military cadre schools. Ke Shude used "going to university" as an inducement to prevent student Wang Chunlan from joining the military cadre school. The "Legion of Mary" elements also engaged in similar sabotage activities at Qilu University.

In January of this year, the "Legion of Mary" conspired to sabotage the assembly of teachers and students of Liming Middle School and patriotic Catholics to denounce imperialist elements, but their conspiracy was crushed by the patriotic enthusiasm of the teachers and students of Liming Middle School. After the meeting, the imperialist element Wu Side slandered the patriotic enthusiasm of the teachers and students of Liming Middle School, saying to the students: "Liming is finished, Liming is dark."

Undermining the Three-Self Reform Movement of the Catholic Church

Since the Catholics in Jinan launched the Three-Self Reform Movement, the main elements in the "Legion of Mary" have actively carried out sabotage activities. For example, in March 1951, they threatened patriotic Catholics by saying: "Participating in the Three-Self is schism and should be abandoned." When the "Queen of Heaven and Earth" district council members of the "Legion of Mary" held a meeting, they clamored: "Signing the reform is betraying the church. Accusing Bishop Yang (Enlai) is a great sin and should be abandoned." As a result, their sabotage conspiracy was gradually crushed under the refutation of enlightened Catholics.

However, the chief culprits of the "Legion of Mary" were not reconciled to the failure of their conspiracy and recently held several secret meetings to conspire to further sabotage the Three-Self Reform Movement of Catholics and resist the People's Government.

The reactionary activities of the "Legion of Mary" have long been intolerable to the people of the city and patriotic Catholics. The Jinan Municipal People's Government issued a public notice on the 25th to ban it in order to protect the interests of the people and maintain social order. We hope that the general members of the "Legion of Mary" should quickly declare their withdrawal from this reactionary organization to the public security sub-bureaus, hand in their certificates, and stop their activities. Catholic schools and organizations should launch denunciations. The reactionary face of the "Legion of Mary" should be completely exposed to the broad masses of the people, so that those imperialist elements and their running dogs can no longer cover up their crimes.

### 反动组织“圣母军”在济南的罪恶活动

　　反动组织“圣母军”在济南的罪恶活动
    帝国主义的侵略工具反动“圣母军”，根本不是宗教团体，而是以天主教为掩护，进行反革命活动的秘密反动组织。“圣母军”直接危害中国人民和爱国天主教徒的利益；从“圣母军”在济南的罪恶活动中，完全证实了这一点。
  在济南的“圣母军”是以美蒋特务为骨干组成的
    “圣母军”，又名“圣母御侍团”、“圣母慈爱祈祷会”。它是具有国际性的天主教内的秘密反动组织。在一九五○年九月九日“圣母军”天津分会的萧永欣奉帝国主义分子黎培里的秘书陈哲敏之命，来济南秘密组织“圣母军”。开始以“圣母慈爱祈祷会”名目出现。他们首先在经五路天主教堂内组成“天主宠爱之母”，在若瑟医院内组成“达味敌楼”两个支会，大力发展组织。后来又组织了“天地之母皇”、“万民之母”、“可爱之母”、“致命之后”四个区会，辖二十个支会，发展“会员”三百余名。今年三月间，又在帝国主义分子的操纵指使策动下，成立了“高级区会”，统一领导四个区会。在以上这些组织中，“圣母军”大量的收罗反革命分子作为骨干。如以国际间谍雷震远与蒋匪“保密局”联合组织的“山东民众救国团”中的特务分子赵子平、刘静山为区会指导司铎，樊步阶为区会长。以蒋匪中统特务李同华等任区会副会长，他们均以传教为外衣，秘密发展“圣母军”的组织，进行反革命破坏活动。
  造谣破坏，一贯进行反动宣传
    当我中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军合力抗击美国侵略军时，“圣母军”首要分子即大肆造谣破坏；潜伏黎明中学的帝国主义分子柯树德、吴思德对“会员”和学生说：“第三次世界大战就要开始，美国武器好，要胜利。”并经常收听、传播“美国之音”。
    “圣母军”对其“会员”积极散布反苏反共的谰言，进行反动教育。“圣母军”组织的操纵者对“会员”说：“这是灾难的时期，是考验我们的时候，要多念经，求‘圣母’把这个灾难很快的过去。”“天主教是光明的，共产党是黑暗的，光明和黑暗是永不能相容的”。今年春天，他们又在讲道时污蔑我中华人民共和国说：“中国到了最危险的时候了，教友们要依靠天主教增加勇气，与这个魔鬼世界斗争”，并恶意辱骂苏联，挑拨中苏友好关系。
    此外，“圣母军”在“会员”和群众中积极散发反动宣传品，如大量散发内容极为反动的“全国主教声明”、“学习参考”、“现代问题问答”等；并召开会议，进行传达、讲解。
  破坏抗美援朝运动，阻挠青年学生的爱国行动
    当全市人民掀起抗美援朝保家卫国运动的时候，“圣母军”即百般进行破坏活动，特别是阻挠青年学生参加军事干部学校，阻止学生参加新民主主义青年团。济南“圣母军”的组织者在一九五○年冬向其“会员”布置“任务”时说：“我们的工作重点是黎明中学的学生们，要设法不使学生们上了‘魔鬼’（诬指共产党）的当”。并派其亲信爪牙拉拢黎明中学学生会主席杨玉宝的家长说：“杨玉宝很聪明，他若能热心奉教，将来教会供他上学；但他现在不热心了，你们得注意！”又曾授命“圣母军”支会秘书刘西庚以“多进堂，不要上‘魔鬼’的当”的诬蔑、欺骗方法，拉拢青年学生于广志等。帝国主义分子柯树德还直接阻挠青年学生的爱国行动——参加军事干部学校。柯树德曾以“上大学”为引诱，阻挠学生王春兰参加军事干部学校。“圣母军”分子在齐鲁大学也有类似破坏活动。
    今年一月间，“圣母军”曾阴谋破坏黎明中学师生和爱国天主教徒控诉帝国主义分子的集会活动，但是，他们的阴谋被黎明中学师生的爱国热情粉碎了。会后，帝国主义分子吴思德则在学生中诬蔑黎明中学师生的爱国热情说：“黎明灭了，黎明黑暗了。”
  破坏天主教的三自革新运动
    济南天主教徒自发起三自革新运动以来，“圣母军”中的主要分子，积极进行破坏活动。如一九五一年三月间，曾以“参加三自，就是裂教，应被弃绝”来恫吓爱国的天主教徒。“圣母军”中的“天地之母皇”区会会员集会时，他们叫嚣：“革新签名就是叛教，控诉了杨（恩赉）主教，就是犯了大罪，应被弃绝”等。结果在觉悟了的天主教徒的驳斥下，他们的破坏阴谋渐次被粉碎了。
    但“圣母军”首恶分子们，并不甘心其阴谋的失败，又在最近，曾数次秘密集会，阴谋策划进一步破坏天主教徒三自革新运动，并对抗人民政府。
    “圣母军”的反动活动，早已为全市人民和爱国天主教徒所不能容忍。济南市人民政府已于二十五日布告予以取缔，以保障人民利益，维护社会秩序。我们希望“圣母军”的一般会员，应迅速向各公安分局声明退出这一反动组织，交出证件。停止活动；天主教会学校、团体应展开控诉。把“圣母军”的反动面目，完全暴露在广大人民面前，使那些帝国主义分子及其走狗，再也无法掩盖其罪恶。
