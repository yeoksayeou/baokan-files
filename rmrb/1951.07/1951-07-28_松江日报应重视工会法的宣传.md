To the Editors of Songjiang Daily:

The Trade Union Law has been promulgated for a year, and the publicity department should make a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Trade Union Law in the past year. People's Daily, Workers' Daily, Northeast Daily, Tianjin Daily, etc., have all done so, but Songjiang Daily has not mentioned a word. In fact, many factories in Songjiang Province have some shortcomings in the implementation of the Trade Union Law. Therefore, I think that the phenomenon of Songjiang Daily neglecting the publicity of the Trade Union Law should be corrected.

### 松江日报应重视工会法的宣传

  　松江日报应重视工会法的宣传编辑同志：
    工会法已经颁布一周年了，宣传部门应当将一年来工会法的执行情况作一综合报道。人民日报、工人日报、东北日报、天津日报等，均已这样作了，但松江日报却一字未提。事实上，松江省不少工厂在工会法的执行上是有一些缺点的。因此，我认为松江日报忽视宣传工会法的现象，是应该纠正的。
