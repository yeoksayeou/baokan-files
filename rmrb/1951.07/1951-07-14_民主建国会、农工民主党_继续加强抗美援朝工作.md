    Continue to Strengthen the Work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Democratic National Construction Association issued a circular to its branches on the 11th, in order to continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, stating: Since the General Association of the Chinese People's Resistance Against America and Aid Korea issued three major patriotic appeals on June 1, and our association issued a circular on June 4, the local branches have actively taken the lead in promoting them in the industrial and commercial circles, making remarkable achievements in implementing the three major patriotic appeals. The rapid increase in production and enthusiastic donations of airplanes and cannons by the industrial and commercial circles in various places show that the patriotic ideology of the industrial and commercial circles has been generally enhanced. The letter pointed out that although the Korean issue may be resolved peacefully, we still have to resist the aggression of American imperialism, and we should continue to complete the following five political tasks: (1) Continue to work hard to promote the production increase and donation movement; (2) Do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, and cooperate with local organizations and groups to hold a general comfort the troops movement on August 1; (3) Continue to mobilize young people in the industrial and commercial sectors to participate in military cadre schools; (4) Continue to implement patriotic covenants, and earnestly check the implementation status, improve and promote them; (5) Help the comfort groups to Korea and the representatives of the Volunteers to complete the propaganda work.
