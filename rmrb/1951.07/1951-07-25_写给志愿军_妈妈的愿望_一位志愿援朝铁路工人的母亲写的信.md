To the Volunteers,

A Mother's Wish

——A Letter from the Mother of a Railway Worker Volunteering to Aid Korea

Ma Chen'er:

I received your letter and learned that you have launched a campaign to earn merits. Mother hopes you will earn more merits for the people. This is Mother's wish, and also the wish of every volunteer's mother and all mothers of comrades participating in the volunteer aid to Korea work.

Comrade Liu Hulan's mother wrote a letter to mothers across the country. After studying it, I was deeply moved. Although Mother is sixty-two years old, I still urgently want to improve my political and cultural level; therefore, Mother has recently joined the family study class at Datong Station. Mother learns four characters every day, making sure I can write, read, and use them. In three months, Mother will try to write you a letter in my own hand.

You are Mother's good son, and you hope that Mother can live a good life. Don't forget when we ate moldy bran porridge during the enemy and puppet period. Now the United States is rearming Japan, not letting us live a good life. You must earn more merits and severely strike the enemy. This is to defend your motherland and to defend your mother.

The heroic deeds of Comrade Guan Changhai, a railway worker volunteering to aid Korea, in rescuing an explosives truck, were published in our People's Daily. This is so glorious! You should learn from him. Comrade Liu Keqin and other seven comrades from the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot who volunteered to go to Korea gloriously sacrificed themselves. They will always be remembered in the hearts of the people. You must avenge the seven martyrs.

Mother's illness is cured. Responsible comrades from the station administration and the trade union often come to our home to understand our family's living conditions and often bring things. When Mother goes to the cooperative to buy things, I also receive special care. Everywhere I go, people respect me. Mother's good son, this is the glory you have won for Mother!

Finally, I hope you will strive to earn more great merits in the merit-earning campaign, so that the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea will come sooner. At that time, Mother will go to the platform at the station to welcome you back in glory.

Your Mother, Zhou Xiuling

(Spoken by Zhou Xiuling, recorded by Ma Xiaoyu from Datong Station)

　　写给志愿军
　　妈妈的愿望
　  ——一位志愿援朝铁路工人的母亲写的信马琛儿：
    来信收到，知道你们展开了立功运动。妈妈希望你多为人民立功。这是妈妈的愿望，也是每一位志愿军同志的母亲和所有参加志愿援朝工作同志的母亲们的愿望。
    刘胡兰同志的母亲给全国母亲写了一封信。我学习后，深深受到感动。妈妈虽然六十二岁了，但是还迫切要求提高政治、文化水平；因此妈在最近参加了大同站家属学习班。妈每天学习四个字，做到能写、能读、能用，再过三个月，妈争取亲笔给你写信。
    你是妈的好儿子，你是希望妈能过好日子的。你别忘了咱们在敌伪时期吃发了霉的糠面粥的事。现在美国又重新武装日本，不让咱们过好日子。你一定要多多立功，狠狠打击敌人。这是为了保卫你的祖国，也是为了保卫你的妈妈。
    志愿援朝铁路工人关长海同志抢救炸药车的英雄事迹，登在咱们的人民日报上。这是多么光荣呀！你要向他学习。张家口机务段志愿赴朝的工人刘克勤等七位同志光荣牺牲了。他们会永远记在人民的心里。你要为七烈士报仇。
    妈的病好了。车站行政和工会的负责同志常到咱家来，了解我们家的生活情况，并且常常送东西来。妈到合作社买东西，也受到特别照顾。到处有人尊敬我。妈的好儿子，这是你给妈争来的光荣呵！
    最后，希望你在立功运动中争取多立大功，使抗美援朝最后胜利早日到来。到那时候，妈到车站的站台上迎接你光荣回来。
            你的母亲  周秀龄
        （周秀龄口述，大同车站马效瑜记）
