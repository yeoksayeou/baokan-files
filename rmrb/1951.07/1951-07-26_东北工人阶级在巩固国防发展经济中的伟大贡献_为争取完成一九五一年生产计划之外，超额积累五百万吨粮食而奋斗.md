　　The Great Contribution of the Northeast Working Class in Consolidating National Defense and Developing the Economy
　  ——Striving to Accumulate an Extra 5 Million Tons of Grain Beyond the 1951 Production Plan
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper　Tan Lire
    Comrade Gao Gang instructed all the people of Northeast China that the task for 1951 is, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, to further build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force on the basis of last year's work. Because, as long as imperialism exists, there is nothing without a strong national defense. Only when our national defense force is stronger can our economic construction achievements and the cause of peace we are striving for be better guaranteed. At the same time, he pointed out that only by developing production and building a strong economic force can we further improve the people's lives, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and provide a reliable material foundation for national defense construction. Therefore, further developing industrial and agricultural production in Northeast China has become the main task.
    Under this clear and profound instruction of Comrade Gao Gang, industrial and agricultural production in Northeast China this year will be actively improved and expanded. According to the 1951 plan, the total value of industrial and agricultural output will increase by 13.5 percent compared to 1950, with industrial production increasing by 16.43 percent and agricultural production increasing by 11.25 percent.
    According to the statistics for the first quarter of 1951, industrial production has exceeded the original plan by 103 percent, an increase of 32.7 percent over the same period last year. Among the 47 major products in the industrial system, 32, including raw coal, steel ingots, steel, machine tools, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and麻袋(ma dai - sacks) have completed and exceeded the plan.
    However, the working class is always looking forward and is never satisfied with the achievements it has made. Therefore, at the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Urban Work Conference held in May this year, Comrade Gao Gang, under the general task of consolidating national defense and developing the economy, put forward a new, current, and serious political task for the Northeast working class, which is: how to unleash the potential of industry and strive to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 5 million tons of grain this year on the basis of completing the original plan. He pointed out that the solution is: to save 2 million tons of investment by accelerating the turnover of working capital; to accumulate an extra 1.5 million tons by reducing costs; and to increase and save 1.5 million tons by improving equipment utilization, improving operating methods, reducing waste products, and improving quality. The successful completion of this task will increase the total value of industrial output by another 15.4 percent in addition to completing the original plan. The Northeast working class greeted this great task with full confidence and is actively working to achieve it. For example, all employees of the Machine No. 2 Factory guarantee that they will increase the machine utilization rate from 54.4 percent to 78.34 percent; reduce the working capital turnover period from 162 days to 122 days; further strengthen technical management, cost management, and financial management, reduce costs, improve quality, and launch a mass movement to save electricity, which can increase production and save more than 10.329 billion yuan for the country. All employees of the Forest Industry Bureau guarantee that from July 1951 to September 1952, they will save the state 200,000 tons of grain in working capital from accelerating capital turnover alone; in addition, they will give full play to industrial potential, increase the average efficiency of forest railway transportation by 30 percent in 1952, reduce forest railway freight by 10 percent, and reduce timber production costs by 10 percent; in terms of harvesting, organize the labor force well to improve labor efficiency, implement reasonable material selection, and further improve the material selection rate; in terms of transportation, reduce the loss rate from 1.5 percent to 1 percent. All employees of the No. 6 Paper Mill also proposed: to overproduce by 12 percent, to further reduce costs by 10 to 12 percent, and to accelerate capital turnover, shortening the past planned turnover period of 120 days to 85 days. Under the patriotic labor enthusiasm of the Northeast working class, it is entirely possible to complete the 1951 production plan and increase production and save 5 million tons of grain.
    What does this great action of the Northeast working class tell us?
    First: After the working class gained the leading position in state power, it created new labor productivity, increased the proportion of industrial production, and provided a strong guarantee for consolidating the new democratic state system. After the Northeast working class became the master of state-owned enterprises, it greatly improved labor productivity with unparalleled labor enthusiasm. For example, the average efficiency per worker in Northeast coal mines has increased from 0.33 tons in 1946 to 0.63 tons in 1950. That is to say, it has increased by nearly one time. This has led to a year-by-year increase in the proportion of industrial production in Northeast China. In 1949, industry accounted for 35 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural output, while in 1950 it had increased to 43 percent. This year, it will increase to 47 percent. Lenin said: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and most important condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." The achievements of the working class in industrial production are of such great significance because in state-owned industry "the proletariat represents and realizes a higher form of social labor organization than capitalism" (Lenin). At the same time, compared with the vast number of peasants, it also represents new and higher productive forces. For example, judging from the production plan of state-owned industry in Northeast China this year, the total value of industrial output will account for 46.3 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural output, while the total annual output value of the 33 million farmers in Northeast China will account for 53.7 percent. If we compare the labor productivity of a worker and a farmer in 1950, then a farmer can produce an average of only two tons of grain per year, while a worker can produce about 48 tons. That is to say, the value created by a worker is about 24 times that of a farmer. From the perspective of the proportion of industrial and agricultural output to the state's fiscal revenue, the profits of state-owned industrial enterprises in Northeast China this year are planned to be more than twice as large as the public grain paid by all farmers. Therefore, Lenin once said: "To save Russia, it is not enough to rely on a bumper harvest in the peasant economy... Without industry, we cannot maintain our status as an independent country at all." As Chairman Mao instructed: "Only when China's industry develops and China does not depend on foreign countries economically can there be complete and real independence." Therefore, every contribution of the working class in industrial production has extremely important significance for the construction of new China. The development of industry will provide a strong guarantee for the consolidation of the new democratic state system.
    Secondly, the development of industry will greatly assist the development of agriculture and improve the lives of farmers, thereby consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The development of industry will greatly increase the quantity of necessities supplied to the people (mainly farmers) for production and life. The planned total value of means of livelihood produced by state-owned industry in 1951 will increase by 22.79 percent compared with last year. The increase in industrial products ensures the stability of general prices. The price index in March this year rose by only 0.9 per mille compared with December last year, but agricultural product prices rose by 10.1 percent, while industrial product prices fell by 1.5 percent. In order to ensure the sale of farmers' products, state trade agencies purchased farmers' surplus grain and native products. From the fourth quarter of last year to June this year, grain purchases have exceeded the plan by 27 percent, and native products have also been purchased by 61.7 percent. At the same time, state trade agencies and cooperatives supplied farmers with the necessities of production and life in a timely manner. According to statistics, from January to May this year, the supply of commodities to the people in Northeast China has exceeded more than four times that of the same period in 1949, and has also increased by nearly one time compared with the same period last year. Among them, yarn increased by 70 percent, department stores increased by 75 percent, coal increased by one-third, and industrial equipment (mainly means of production) increased by five times. The more than 30,000 tons of seeds and more than 800,000 jin of pesticides that the state loaned to farmers are all based on the development of industry. The increase in agricultural product prices, the decrease in industrial product prices, and the brisk sales of agricultural products will undoubtedly improve the lives of farmers and greatly stimulate farmers' reproduction. However, the problem is not limited to this. More importantly, the development of industry will prepare the necessary conditions for leading farmers into socialist society. Chairman Mao said: "Without the socialization of agriculture, there will be no complete and consolidated socialism. And if we want to socialize agriculture, we must develop a strong industry with state-owned enterprises as the mainstay. The state of the people's democratic dictatorship must solve the problem of this country's industrialization step by step." As Stalin taught the Soviet working class in 1929: "We must strive to develop our industry, because it is the basic source that agriculture relies on for transformation," "is the key to transforming agriculture according to the collective principle." Therefore, the result of the Northeast working class's efforts to complete the 1951 industrial production plan and increase production and save 5 million tons of grain will further improve the industrial level of Northeast China, thus strengthening the economic foundation of the worker-peasant alliance.
    Third, the potential of industry is rich and huge, and unleashing the potential of industry is the source of developing a strong national economic force. The recovery and development of industrial production in Northeast China has made great achievements. However, the potential of industry has not yet been fully utilized. This is reflected in the fact that the utilization efficiency of equipment is not high. For example, the machine utilization rate of Machine No. 2 Factory in May was only 54 percent, and a certain furnace in the sixth workshop only achieved 67 percent of the utilization rate in the first quarter, which was reduced to 59 percent in May due to repairs. The No. 6 Paper Mill wasted 1,725 working hours due to 955 accidents in the first half of this year, which is equivalent to more than 70 days of non-production for one machine. The value of the loss, if used to make ordinary uniforms for all workers in the factory, would give each person 15 sets. Secondly, due to poor technical and operating methods, the quality of products is not high, resulting in defective products, which waste raw materials, and the losses caused are also alarming. For example, the loss caused by defective products in Machine No. 3 Factory in March was 340 million yuan, and the loss of defective products in Machinery No. 13 Factory in 1949 and 1950 reached 2.1 billion yuan. If this money is used to buy high-quality white flour, more than 20,000 bags can be bought. Again, it is also reflected in the slow turnover of working capital. For example, the Textile Administration Bureau planned to turn over four times throughout 1950, but actually only reached 2.8 times. The raw materials accumulated could not be used up in three months, plus some stagnant materials, worth about 100 billion yuan. The semi-finished products accumulated in the workshop of the Woolen Mill each month account for about 53 percent of the total monthly output value. Finally, it is also reflected in the high cost of products and the accumulation of products. Therefore, how to unleash the potential of industry has become an extremely important issue in the current construction of Northeast China. Its impact on the whole country is also extremely significant. Therefore, at the Northeast Urban Work Conference in May this year, Comrade Gao Gang put forward the political task of unleashing the potential of industry. It was decided to accelerate the turnover of working capital and shorten the cycle by 45 days; to reduce the cost of various products by 10 percent; to improve equipment utilization, improve operating methods; to reduce defective products and improve quality; and to strive to increase the total value of products by 7 to 8 percent compared with the original plan. A total of 5 million tons of grain worth of production and savings can be achieved. Five million tons of grain is an extremely large quantity, equivalent to two and a half times the total industrial investment in Northeast China in 1949, and approximately equal to the total industrial investment in Northeast China last year. If it is used to expand reproduction, 900,000 new spindles can be installed. If 20 counts of yarn are spun, more than 17,000 pieces can be spun throughout the year. This shows that the potential of industry is rich and huge. We must pay close attention to studying the problems in industry and find ways to unleash the potential of industry. In the face of this great political task, the Northeast working class has brought into play their wisdom and creativity, and demonstrated their noble revolutionary essence. For example, the first branch of the No. 6 Paper Mill has improved its mechanical equipment, changing from the past positive pulping to reverse pulping. The quality has reached 90 percent of first-class products from 90 percent of second-class products, and the paper speed has increased by an average of 7 meters per minute. The quality of the second branch has also increased by 18 percent, the mechanical operation rate has increased by 7.2 percent, and the cost has decreased by 13.5 percent. For example, employees of a certain shipyard have learned advanced Soviet technology - high-speed cutting - and have brought into play the high efficiency of machinery. It used to take two minutes and forty seconds to turn a sliding wheel, but now it only takes two minutes and forty seconds, the quality meets the standards, and the efficiency has increased by 60 times. A certain group in Machine No. 5 Factory adopted the Kovalev working method, which increased the group's work efficiency by nearly one time. The plug-in and assembly group of the transformer workshop of the No. 5 Electric Factory adopted the Kovalev working method, which guaranteed the quality of the products 100 percent. The creativity of the working class has provided a reliable guarantee for increasing production and saving 5 million tons of grain, and has made it possible to maximize the potential of industry.
    Fourth, it points out the path of national capital accumulation: it must be done through increasing production and saving. To create the foundation for national industrialization, there must be sufficient funds. Where does the money come from? At present, they are mainly: agricultural tax, urban tax revenue and corporate profits, as well as savings in various aspects. At present, from the national scope, urban tax revenue is the largest national income, followed by agricultural tax; but both agricultural tax revenue and urban tax revenue have certain limits. Therefore, the main source of industrial funds in the future is to rely on corporate accumulation. That is, we must rely on the working class to actively increase production and save, as well as all organs to practice frugality. For example, the profits of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China this year will account for 42.12 percent of total fiscal revenue, an increase of more than 6 percent compared with last year; while various taxes account for only 37.6 percent (excluding public grain). The resolution of the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that the speed of national capital expansion depends primarily on the scale of capital accumulation in state-owned industry. At the same time, it pointed out the serious significance of implementing savings, saying: "If we do not strictly and firmly implement the savings system, it is impossible to achieve national industrialization... Only by resolutely implementing the savings system can we and must save huge amounts of funds for further economic development on the basis of national industrialization." Comrade Stalin said in summing up the Soviet Union's first five-year plan: "Prescribing extremely strict savings methods and accumulating the funds necessary to subsidize our industrialization is the path we should take to achieve the goal of restoring heavy industry and realizing the five-year plan." Chairman Mao pointed out in "Striving for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the State's Financial and Economic Situation" that to achieve a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation, three conditions are needed, one of which is: "A large reduction in the expenses required by state organs." Therefore, the Northeast working class's creation of 5 million tons of grain worth of wealth for the country by means of increasing production and saving points out the main path that the country should take to accumulate funds, and at the same time, it has made a good start for implementing the savings system.
    What do these great contributions made by the Northeast working class ultimately show? This is: the working class represents advanced productive forces and is a developing class. At the same time, it relies on the leadership and education of the Communist Party and is the most advanced class armed with Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It has brought into play its leading role and has also consolidated its leading position. However, with the increasing demands of Northeast China's economic development and the increasing tasks of consolidating national defense, the Northeast working class also needs to work harder and strive for greater achievements.

　　东北工人阶级在巩固国防发展经济中的伟大贡献
　  ——为争取完成一九五一年生产计划之外，超额积累五百万吨粮食而奋斗
    本报特约记者　谈立人
    高岗同志指示给全东北人民一九五一年的任务，就是在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在去年工作的基础上，进一步建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量。因为，当帝国主义还存在的时候，没有强大的国防就没有一切，只有我们的国防力量愈强大，我们的经济建设成果和我们所致力争取的和平事业才愈有保障。同时，他指出：也只有发展生产和建设强大的经济力量，才能进一步改善人民生活，更加巩固人民民主专政，使国防建设有可靠的物质基础。因之，进一步发展东北的工农业生产，便成为主要的任务。
    在高岗同志这一明确深刻的指示下，东北今年的工农业生产，将积极地提高和扩大。按照一九五一年计划，工农业生产总值将比一九五○年提高百分之十三点五，其中工业生产提高百分之十六点四三，农业生产提高百分之十一点二五。
    据一九五一年第一季度的统计，工业生产已经超额完成了原计划的百分之一百零三，比去年同期增加了百分之三十二点七，其中工业部系统的四十七种主要产品完成并超过计划的就有原煤、钢锭、钢材、工作母机、棉纱、纱布、麻袋等三十二种。
    但是，工人阶级是永远向前看的，任何时期决不满足于既得的成绩。所以，在今年五月，中共中央东北局召开的城市工作会议上，高岗同志在巩固国防发展经济的总任务下，又向东北工人阶级提出了一个新的当前的严重的政治任务，这就是：如何发挥工业中的潜在能力，为今年在完成原定计划的基础之上，再增产和节约价值等于五百万吨粮食的财富而奋斗。并指出解决的办法是：以加速流动资金的周转节约二百万吨的投资；以降低成本，超额积累一百五十万吨；以提高设备运用率，改善操作方法，减少废品，提高质量，增加和节约一百五十万吨。这一任务的胜利完成，将使今年的工业生产总值在完成原定计划之外，又提高百分之十五点四。东北工人阶级满怀信心地迎接了这一伟大的任务，并为其实现而积极地工作着。比如：机器二厂全体职工保证：将机器运用率由百分之五十四点四，提高到百分之七十八点三四；流动资金周转期由一百六十二天降低到一百二十二天；进一步加强技术管理、成本管理和财务管理，降低成本，提高质量，并发动群众性的节省电力运动，共可为国家增产和节约一百零三亿二千九百多万元。森林工业局全体职工保证：从一九五一年七月到一九五二年九月，从加速资金周转一项中为国家节省流动资金二十万吨粮食；另外，充分发挥工业潜力，在一九五二年平均提高森林铁路运材效能百分之三十，降低森林铁路运费百分之十，制材成本降低百分之十；在采伐方面，组织好劳动力以提高劳动效率，实行合理选材，把选材率提高一步；在流送方面，把损失率从百分之一点五降低到百分之一。造纸六厂全体职工也提出：超额生产百分之十二，将成本再降低百分之十到十二，加速资金周转，由过去计划周转期一百二十天，缩短到八十五天。在东北工人阶级的这种爱国主义的劳动热情下，完成一九五一年生产计划之外，再增产和节约五百万吨粮食，是完全有把握实现的。
    从东北工人阶级的这一伟大的行动当中，告诉我们些什么呢？
    首先：工人阶级取得国家政权的领导地位后，创造了新的劳动生产率，提高了工业生产比重，给巩固新民主主义国家制度以有力的保障。东北工人阶级成为国家企业的主人之后，以无比的劳动热情，大大提高了劳动生产率。例如：全东北煤矿每工平均效率已从一九四六年的零点三三吨，提高到一九五○年的零点六三吨。就是说，提高了将近一倍。这使东北工业生产比重逐年提高。一九四九年，工业尚占工农业生产总值的百分之三十五，而一九五○年已增至百分之四十三。今年又将增至百分之四十七。列宁说过：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件”。工人阶级在工业生产上的成绩，所以有如此重大的意义，是因为在国营工业中“无产阶级是代表着并实现着比着资本主义更高式样的社会劳动组织”（列宁）。同时，比起广大的农民来，它也是代表着新的更高的生产力。比如：从东北今年国营工业的生产计划来看，工业生产总值将占工农业生产总值的百分之四十六点三，东北三千三百万农民的全年生产总值，占百分之五十三点七。如按一九五○年一个工人的劳动生产率和一个农民劳动生产率来比较，那末一个农民平均全年仅可生产两吨粮，而一个工人约可生产到四十八吨。就是说：一个工人创造的价值约等于一个农民的二十四倍。从工农业所提供给国家财政收入的比重来看，东北今年计划中的国营工业的企业利润，约等于全体农民所缴公粮的两倍还多。所以列宁曾说过：“为要挽救俄国，单靠农民经济收成丰盛还不够……没有工业，我们就根本不能维持我们为独立国家的地位。”也正如毛主席所指示的：“只有中国的工业发展了，中国在经济上不依赖外国了，才有全部的真正的独立。”所以，工人阶级在工业生产上的每一个贡献，对新中国的建设事业都具有极重大的意义。工业的发展，将对新民主主义国家制度的巩固，给以有力的保障。
    其次，工业的发展，将大大援助了农业的发展，改善农民的生活，因而，巩固了工农联盟。工业发展的结果，将大大增加供应人民（主要是农民）生产和生活的必需品的数量。一九五一年国营工业生产的生活资料总值计划比去年提高百分之二十二点七九。工业品增多，就保障了一般物价的稳定。今年三月的物价指数，如去年十二月仅上涨了千分之九，但农业品价格却上升百分之十点一，工业品物价下降了百分之一点五。为了保证农民生产品的出售，国家贸易机关收购了农民多余的粮食和土产。从去年第四季度到今年六月间，购粮已超过计划百分之二十七，土产也收购了百分之六十一点七。同时，国家贸易机关与合作社对农民及时地供给了生产和生活必需品。据统计，今年一月至五月份，东北区人民的商品供应量，已超过一九四九年同期的四倍多，比去年同期也增加近一倍。其中纱布增加了百分之七十，百货增加了百分之七十五，煤炭增加了三分之一，工业器材（主要是生产资料）增加了五倍。国家向农民贷放的种籽三万余吨和农药八十余万斤，都是以工业的发展为其基础的。农业品价格的上涨，工业品价格的下降，以及农产品的畅销，无疑问的将改善了农民的生活，大大刺激了农民的再生产。但是，问题还不止此。更重要的是工业的发展，将给领导农民走入社会主义社会准备必要的条件。毛主席说：“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。而欲农业社会化，必须发展以国有企业为主体的强大的工业。人民民主专政的国家，必须有步骤地解决这个国家工业化的问题。”也正如斯大林在一九二九年教导苏联工人阶级所说的：“必须努力发展我国工业，因为它是农业生产改造事业所仰给的基本泉源”，“是按集体制原则改造农业的关键”。所以，东北工人阶级努力完成一九五一年工业生产计划之外，再增产和节约五百万吨粮食的结果，将使东北工业水平进一步提高，因此，也就增强了工农联盟的经济基础。
    第三、工业的潜在能力是丰富而巨大的，发挥工业的潜在能力，是发展国家强大的经济力量的泉源。东北工业生产的恢复和发展是有很大的成绩的。但是，工业的潜在能力，还远未充分发挥。这表现在设备的运用效率还不高。例如，机器二厂五月份的机器运用率仅为百分之五十四，第六车间的某种炉在第一季度中只发挥运用率的百分之六十七，五月份由于检修降低到百分之五十九。造纸六厂今年上半年因为发生事故九百五十五次，浪费了一千七百二十五个工时，等于一台机器七十多天未生产。其损失的价值，如给全厂工人做普通制服，每人可得十五套。其次，由于技术和操作方法不良，产品质量不高，造成废品，浪费原料，所造成的损失也是惊人的。如机器三厂三月份因废品造成的损失是三亿四千万元，机械十三厂一九四九年和一九五○年的废品损失达二十一亿元，如用这笔钱买特等白面，可买两万多袋。再次，又表现在流动资金周转慢。如纺织管理局一九五○年全年计划周转四次，实际仅达二·八次，积压的原料三个月用不完，再加上一部分呆滞材料，约值一千亿元。毛织厂每月在车间积压的在制品约占全月生产总值的百分之五十三。最后，还表现在产品的成本高和产品的积压方面。因此，如何发挥工业的潜在能力，就成为东北当前建设中的一个极重要的问题。它对于全国的影响，也是极为重大的。所以，在今年五月的东北城市工作会议上，高岗同志提出了发挥工业中的潜在能力的政治任务。决定加速流动资金周转，缩短周期四十五天；将各种产品成本降低百分之十；提高设备运用率，改善操作法；减少废品，提高质量；争取产品总值较原计划增加百分之七到八。共计可增产和节约五百万吨粮食的价值。五百万吨粮食是一个极大的数量，等于一九四九年东北全部工业投资额的两倍半，约等于去年东北全部的工业投资额。如果用之扩大再生产，可安设九十万新纺锭，如纺二十支纱，全年可纺一万七千余件。这说明工业中的潜在能力是丰富而巨大的。我们必须很好地注意研究工业中的问题，设法发挥工业中的潜在能力。在这一伟大的政治任务面前，东北工人阶级发挥了他们的智慧和创造性，表现了高贵的革命本质。例如：造纸六厂的一分厂改进了机械设备，已由过去的正上浆，改为逆上浆，质量由百分之九十的二等品，已达到了百分之九十的一等品，并使抄纸速度平均每分钟提高了七米。二分厂的质量也提高了百分之十八，机械运转率提高了百分之七点二，成本降低了百分之十三点五。例如，某造船厂职工因学会了苏联的先进技术——高速切削法，发挥了机械的高度效能。过去车一个滑子轮要用两点四十分，现在仅用两分四十秒，质量合乎标准，效率提高了六十倍。机器五厂某小组因采用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，使小组工作效率提高近一倍。电工五厂变压器车间的插报和装配组因采用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，百分之百地保证了产品质量。工人阶级的创造性，使增产和节约五百万吨粮食有了可靠的保证，使工业潜在能力的最大限度的发挥有了实现的可能。
    第四、它指出了国家资金积累的道路：必须通过增产和节约的办法。创造国家工业化的基础，必须要有足够的资金。资金从何处来？目前主要是：农业税、城市税收和企业的利润，以及各方面节约。在目前，从全国范围来说，城市税收是最大的国家收入，其次是农业税；但农业税收和城市税收都是有一定限度的。因此，将来工业资金的主要来源，是依靠企业的积累。即要依靠工人阶级的积极增产和节约，以及所有机关实行节约。比如东北今年国营企业的利润，将占全部财政收入的百分之四十二点一二，比去年增加了百分之六强；而各种税收仅占百分之三十七点六（公粮在外）。联共第十五次代表会议决议中指出过：国家资金扩大的速度，首先取决于国营工业资金积累之规模。同时指出实行节约的严重意义说：“如果不严格地坚定不移地实行节约制度，要实现国家工业化是不可能的……只有坚决实行节约制度，才能够而且也必须为在国家工业化基础上进一步发展经济，保存巨量的资金”。斯大林同志在总结苏联第一个五年计划时说过：“规定极严格节省的办法，积蓄为资助我国工业化所必需的经费，——这就是我们为达到恢复重工业和实现五年计划目的所应走的道路”。毛主席在《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》一文中指出：要获得财政经济状况的根本好转，需要三个条件，其中一条就是：“国家机构所需经费的大量节减”。所以，东北工人阶级以增产和节约办法为国家创造五百万吨粮食的财富，指出了国家积累资金所应走的主要道路，同时，也为实行节约制度做了一个良好的开端。
    东北工人阶级所做的这些伟大的贡献，最后归结起来，说明了什么呢？这就是：工人阶级是代表先进生产力的，是个发展着的阶级，同时它是依靠了共产党的领导和教育，以马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的，最先进的阶级，它已发挥了它的领导作用，同时也巩固了它的领导地位。但是，随着东北经济的发展要求和巩固国防任务的加重，东北工人阶级也还需要更加努力，为争取更大的成绩而奋斗。
