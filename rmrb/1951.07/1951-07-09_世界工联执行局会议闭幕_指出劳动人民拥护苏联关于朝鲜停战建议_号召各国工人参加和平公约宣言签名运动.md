Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 8th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Executive Bureau meeting successfully concluded on the 7th, according to TASS. The afternoon session on the 7th discussed the WFTU's budget and unanimously adopted the WFTU Executive Bureau's declaration to the working people of the world. The declaration stated: The terrible destruction in Korea and the sacrifices of millions of people have illustrated the magnitude of suffering that a new war will bring. Therefore, the Soviet Union's great proposal for an armistice in Korea has won the support of all working people. The declaration then said: The WFTU Executive Bureau calls on workers in all countries to support the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact and to sign the declaration. Let your millions of signatures accelerate the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. This will be a valuable contribution to the cause of peace desired by the entire working humanity and all honest people in the world.

The meeting adopted resolutions on the first, second, and third items on the agenda, and decided to make proposals to the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," the "International Federation of Christian Trade Unions," the "International Trade Secretariats," and several independent trade unions to take joint action. The proposal stated: The material conditions of the working people in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies are deteriorating day by day, while the profits of the big capitalists are constantly increasing. The working people know that unity is the only condition to improve their situation. Therefore, they hope that trade union organizations will help and support them to meet their immediate social and economic needs and to guarantee reasonable living conditions. All trade union organizations cannot stand aloof from the struggle of the working people. In order to support the expectations and demands of the working people, the World Federation of Trade Unions proposes to you and your organizations, inviting you to gather together to discuss measures to protect the vital interests of the working people. Regardless of our differences in political and religious beliefs, we must and can take concerted action on issues related to improving the working and living conditions of workers and employees, and work together to defend their rights against encroachment by monopoly capitalists.

The participants in the meeting sent telegrams to the Chairman of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Lebanese representative Malik, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida, protesting the sentences imposed on twenty Japanese workers in the "Matsukawa Incident."

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 8th: The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting on the afternoon of the 6th discussed the WFTU's social insurance work and the preparations for the WFTU Council meeting. The meeting considered the current situation in capitalist countries where social insurance allocations have been greatly reduced due to the intensification of war preparations, and decided to convene an international social insurance conference, which will be held on as broad a basis as possible. The Executive Bureau also decided to accept the invitation of the Free German Trade Union Federation to hold a plenary meeting of the WFTU Council in Berlin from November 15th to 21st this year. The meeting will hear the WFTU's work report and discuss strengthening the unity of the working class to strive for improved living standards and to oppose the social and economic consequences caused by the Western countries' war preparations.
