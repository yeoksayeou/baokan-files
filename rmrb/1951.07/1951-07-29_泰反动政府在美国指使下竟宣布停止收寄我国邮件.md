　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th: Bangkok dispatch: Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Thai reactionary government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram recently barbarously announced the suspension of receiving mail sent to China, as a measure to implement the "embargo" against us, attempting to sever all ties between the 3.5 million Chinese residing in Thailand and their motherland. A Thai Ministry of Transportation official said in a statement on the 12th: The Thai Ministry of Transportation has decided to sever postal relations with China. This decision has been officially promulgated and implemented by the Thai Postal Administration. From now on, all letters and objects sent to China will not be delivered by the authorities. The official also said: Letters sent from China to Thailand also cannot be delivered, because when these letters pass through Hong Kong, the British authorities in Hong Kong will refuse to forward them.

　　This illegal measure by Thailand has aroused the anger of the broad masses of overseas Chinese.

　　泰反动政府在美国指使下竟宣布停止收寄我国邮件
    【新华社广州二十八日电】曼谷消息：在美帝国主义指使下，泰国銮披汶反动政府最近横蛮地宣布停止接收寄往中国的邮件，作为对我实施“禁运”的一项措施，企图借此断绝我三百五十万居留泰国侨胞与祖国的一切联系。泰国交通部官员于十二日发表谈话称：泰国交通部已决定在邮政上与中国断绝关系。这项决定已经由泰邮政厅正式颁布实施。以后一切寄往中国的信函、物件，当局一概不予递送。该官员又说：由中国寄来泰国的函件也无法递送，因为这些函件经过香港时，香港英国当局会拒绝转递。
    泰国这项非法措施，已激起广大华侨的愤怒。
