　　全苏今年第一季社会主义生产竞赛
    莫斯科许多企业获得头奖
    【新华社十五日讯】在争取提前完成今年生产计划的社会主义竞赛中，莫斯科工人已获得了重大的成就。据塔斯社消息：今年头五个月莫斯科工业的总产量计划已完成了百分之一百零三点八，比去年同期增加了百分之十七点二，劳动生产率提高了百分之十二点五。今年上半年的生产计划在六月底以前就已超额完成，辗金属、钢、机器设备、建筑材料和日用品的产量已大为增加。生产竞赛中已涌现了许多先进的企业。例如，在今年第一季中，莫斯科共有一百五十个企业获得了苏联全国社会主义竞赛的头奖。第一球轴承工厂的五百个生产小组已成为“产品优良生产组”。“科洛姆纳”机车制造厂由于展开“斯塔哈诺夫工作间”的竞赛，每一机器装置单位的产量指数，已超过今年上半年计划的百分之十四，生产成本降低了百分之三。
    现在，莫斯科各业工人已进一步展开生产竞赛，以便提前完成全年的生产计划。约有一百个工厂和两千多个生产部门正在争取“斯塔哈诺夫企业”的称号。在轻工业、食品工业和地方工业等部门中，约有一万五千个生产小组展开了争取成为“产品优良生产组”的竞赛。“加利伯”工厂、“碳化器”工厂和两家球轴承工厂的全体员工已一致决定，除争取“斯塔哈诺夫企业”的光荣称号外，还要争取成为“产品优良企业”。
