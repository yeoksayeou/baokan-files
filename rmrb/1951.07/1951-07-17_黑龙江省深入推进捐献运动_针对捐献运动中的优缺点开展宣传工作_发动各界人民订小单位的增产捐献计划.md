　　Heilongjiang Province Deepens the Donation Movement
　  Carries Out Propaganda Work Targeting the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Donation Movement
　  Mobilizes People from All Walks of Life to Subscribe to Small-Unit Production Increase and Donation Plans
    [Reported by this newspaper] Heilongjiang Province is deeply advancing the production increase and donation movement, determined to continue carrying out propaganda work and mobilizing people from all walks of life to universally formulate small-unit production increase and donation plans. In June, cities and counties throughout the province successively convened enlarged meetings of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea sub-committees or people's representative conferences. Through these meetings, the province has preliminarily determined to donate twenty-seven fighter planes. In the movement, a powerful propaganda team, with the Chinese Communist Party's reporters and propagandists as its core, launched extensive propaganda work. Many factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and rural areas have formulated production increase and donation plans. Local industrial and commercial circles have also convened representative meetings to discuss methods for improving business management, increasing production, and increasing income for donation. When formulating donation plans, people from all walks of life generally combined them with revisions to patriotic pacts. This not only ensured the smooth development of the donation movement but also promoted national economic construction and the development of mass production.
    On the other hand, some shortcomings still exist in the movement: First, production increase and donation plans have not yet been popularized to all grassroots units and the broad masses of people, and the donation movement in a considerable number of areas still remains at the level of plans and appeals from the upper levels. For example, many industries and businesses in the industrial and commercial sectors have not discussed and formulated such plans. In rural areas, only a small number of mutual aid teams and households have popularized production increase and donation plans. If we do not seize the time to mobilize the masses to universally formulate plans, there is a risk of making the plans from above fall through. Second, although some areas have formulated plans, the propaganda and education work has not been sufficient, and the enthusiasm of the masses has not been fully mobilized. There are also individual leaders who underestimate the enthusiasm of the masses and set the donation targets too low, failing to fully utilize the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Third, some area leaders have not grasped the policy of increasing production and increasing income and correctly led the donation movement, resulting in some cadres adopting inappropriate donation methods, such as not taking wages, not seeking medical treatment when sick, and saving money for donations. In individual areas, due to insufficient propaganda and education work, there have been instances of apportionment or disguised apportionment. For example, a certain cooperative stipulated, without the consent of its members, that 1,000 yuan be deducted from each member's income in the second half of the year for donation; in a certain rural area, an average of 20,000 yuan was apportioned per hectare of land. Fourth, the donation movement was carried out in isolation and not combined with the implementation of patriotic pacts and preferential treatment work. In addition, after the news of the Korean armistice negotiations was published, some people developed complacency, slackness, and blind optimism. Some even said: "The war is not going to be fought, so donating weapons is useless now."
    In order to carry out the donation movement correctly and deeply, relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province have decided to organize propaganda forces from all sides once again to continue carrying out propaganda work; and to mobilize all organizations, government agencies, schools, factories, rural areas, and industrial and commercial sectors to universally convene a representative meeting in the near future to promote advantages, correct shortcomings, and deeply mobilize people from all walks of life, taking residential groups, production teams, and even households as units, concentrating mass opinions and experience, formulating specific production increase and donation plans, and stipulating methods for realizing the plans.

　　黑龙江省深入推进捐献运动
　  针对捐献运动中的优缺点开展宣传工作
　  发动各界人民订小单位的增产捐献计划
    【本报讯】黑龙江省深入推进增产捐献运动，决继续开展宣传工作，发动各界人民，普遍制订小单位的增产捐献计划。六月份内，该省各市、县相继召开了抗美援朝分会委员扩大会议或各界人民代表会议。经过这些会议，全省已初步确定捐献二十七架战斗机。在运动中，以中国共产党的报告员、宣传员为核心的强大宣传队伍，展开了广泛的宣传工作。许多工厂、企业、机关、学校与农村，都制订了增产捐献计划。各地工商界也召开了代表会议，讨论了改善经营管理、增加生产、增加收入的捐献办法。各界人民在制订捐献计划时，一般都结合修订了爱国公约。这不仅保证了捐献运动的顺利开展，同时也促进了国家经济建设与群众生产的发展。
    另一方面，运动中还存在着一些缺点：第一，增产捐献计划还未普及到所有基层单位和广大群众中去，还有相当一部分地区的捐献运动仍停留在上层的计划与号召上。如工商界的各行业与各营业户，很多未讨论制订此项计划。农村中增产捐献计划普及到互助组与户的还是少数。如不抓紧时间发动群众普遍订出计划来，有使上边的计划落空的危险。第二，有的地区虽然订出了计划，但宣传教育工作作得不够，群众积极性还未高度发挥。也有个别领导者，对群众的积极性估计不足，而过低地规定了捐献目标，不能充分发挥群众的爱国热情。第三，有的地区领导干部没有掌握增加生产、增加收入的方针，正确地领导捐献运动，以致某些干部采取了不适当的捐献办法，例如不要工薪，有病不治，省下钱来捐献。个别地区因未充分进行宣传教育工作，产生摊派或变相摊派现象，如某合作社不经社员同意，规定由下半年社员收益中每人抽出一千元捐献；某农村每垧地平均摊派二万元。第四，孤立搞捐献运动，而未与推行爱国公约和优抚工作结合进行。另外，朝鲜停战谈判消息发表之后，有的人产生了麻痹松懈、盲目乐观情绪。甚至说：“仗不打了，这会捐献武器没啥用了。”
    为使捐献运动正确地、深入地开展，黑龙江省有关方面已决定再一次组织各方面的宣传力量，继续开展宣传工作；并发动各团体、机关、学校、工厂、农村与工商行业，在最近普遍召开一次代表会议，以发扬优点，纠正缺点，并深入发动各界人民，以居民组、生产小组以至以户为单位，集中群众意见和经验，制订具体的增产捐献计划，并规定实现计划的办法。（张恒轩）
