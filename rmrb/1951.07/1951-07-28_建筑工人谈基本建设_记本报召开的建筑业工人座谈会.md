Construction Workers Talk About Basic Construction
　——A Record of the Symposium on the Construction Industry Convened by This Newspaper
　　Song Cheng
　　On July 16th, this newspaper invited experienced construction workers and technicians from Beijing to discuss the design problems of basic construction and the unity between workers and technical personnel. Participants included technicians Yu Desheng, Sun Ruxi, and Wang Xuewu from a certain construction office; carpenters Yao Dianda and Wang Haipeng; Wang Dachuan, a carpenter from Yongmao Construction Engineering Company; Liu Jingjie, a technician from Beijing Construction Cooperative Union; and Song Jiande from the Beijing branch of China Construction Enterprise Company, among others.

Why Do Errors Occur in Engineering Design?
　　Based on their personal experience, they believe that the main reason why problems occur in engineering design, from the perspective of technical personnel, is the lack of a strong sense of responsibility towards the people's cause. (Those present were all on-site workers, who had little contact with the clients, so they could only raise issues regarding engineering technicians.)

No Measurement of Soil Bearing Capacity
　　The lack of a sense of responsibility manifests in many ways. The most important is the lack of thorough investigation and research before design. Song Jiande pointed out that soil bearing capacity is one of the important bases for designing buildings. However, some engineers do not go to the site to conduct on-site surveys of the foundation, but simply sit in their offices and design based on theoretical knowledge from books. This year, the Beijing branch of China Construction Enterprise Company was commissioned to build three classrooms for the Beijing Women Cadres School. During construction, it was discovered that the high earth platform on which the classrooms were to be built was made of garbage. They had to drive a three-meter-long and four-inch-wide pile every 0.8 meters on the foundation and then make a cement foundation. The construction of the three-story office building for the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also revealed garbage underground after construction started. As a result, they had to dig out the garbage from underground and make a cement foundation. Wang Dachuan also presented similar material: Yongmao Construction Engineering Company undertook the construction of the Yanjing Hotel. Without carefully investigating the foundation conditions beforehand, they demolished the original buildings on the site in preparation for construction. Only when construction began did they discover that there was water not far below the ground, requiring hundreds of piles of three to five meters long to be driven before making the foundation. However, driving such piles would cause significant vibration to nearby buildings. As a result, the project had to be stopped, and more than a thousand workers were idle for a long time.

Did Not Get the Foundation Area Right
　　Measuring the size of the foundation is not a difficult task, but some design drawings are inconsistent with the size of the foundation. Song Jiande cited several such examples. For example, the design drawing for the construction of over a hundred wards for the Beijing Municipal Third Hospital this year was half a meter longer than the foundation. The design drawing for the dormitory of the Script Creation Institute of the Film Bureau was 0.8 meters longer than the foundation. As a result, the drawings had to be revised, delaying the construction time.

Did Not Pay Attention to Matching Machine Equipment When Building Factory Buildings
　　The construction of factory buildings must be coordinated with machine equipment, but some architects do not pay attention to this issue during design, resulting in rework and waste. Wang Dachuan pointed out: Yongmao Construction Engineering Company built a boiler room for the state-owned Guanghua Textile and Dyeing Factory. The foundation of the boiler room could only bear a load of three tons. Halfway through the construction of the foundation, it was discovered that a single boiler frame weighed five tons, making it impossible to place the boiler. As a result, work had to be stopped midway, and the problem has not been resolved to this day. Wang Xuewu from a certain construction office also presented a similar example: Last year, a certain construction office built a building on a certain construction site to install communication equipment. The cement floor of the building needed to be punched with holes for the lines to pass through. The designers did not fully grasp the equipment installation situation and determined the drilling of more than a hundred holes on the drawings. After the holes were drilled, dozens of them were in the wrong position, requiring them to be re-drilled in other places. This not only wasted working hours but also weakened the solidity of the building. At that time, the design engineer did not think that his poor design had caused national waste and even said that this was called "exploring experience."

No Thorough Consideration of the Building Itself
　　Some engineers are even careless when drawing design drawings and do not make thorough calculations even for the building itself. Sun Ruxi and Yu Desheng from a certain construction office pointed out that they are building a building for Yuying Primary School. Because the windows of the building were too large, the sinking force was unbalanced, causing cracks in the walls. Yao Dianda and Wang Haipeng also cited the example of the construction of the gate of Yuying Primary School: both the iron gate and the cement pillars next to the gate were made according to the design drawings, but the iron gate was 20 centimeters wider than the entrance. The Guanghua Textile and Dyeing Factory project also had such a situation. Wang Dachuan said that they built a canteen for the factory, but the designer did not design skylights. Only after the house was built was the problem discovered. They had to reopen the skylights.
　　The comrades who participated in the symposium all believed that these large and small wastes were not caused by any objective difficulties but were clearly due to the irresponsibility of the designers.

How Should Workers and Technical Personnel Unite?
　　During the symposium, everyone also discussed the problem of mutual contempt between technical personnel and workers, which affected the work. The engineers believed that they had theory, while the workers only knew how to saw and lay bricks and did not understand the principles. Therefore, they regarded accepting the opinions of workers as a "loss of face." The workers also looked down on the technical personnel. Liu Jingjie said that they called the technical personnel "bookworms" and said, "Even if you bring your British books and American books, you can't build a wall." Sometimes the workers also lacked confidence, fearing that their opinions would not be valued, or fearing that if they raised someone else's opinion, others would raise opinions to them. Even if they knew it was wrong, they still did it, holding the attitude of "I'll do it and show you what a mess it is." Everyone made self-criticism on this issue. Wang Xuewu said that whether it is technical personnel or workers, this kind of mutual contempt and face-saving mentality does not stem from an attitude of being responsible to the people. He and Sun Ruxi cited such an example: In 1949, the boiler room of a building on a certain construction site of a certain construction office was almost one-third smaller than the required area on the design drawing. Although the boiler could be placed, it was impossible to use a fire hook to stoke the fire. The comrades who were constructing the project raised the issue to the architect, but the architect refused to accept it. The construction engineers and workers thought, "It's not worth arguing with you," "You'll know when it's done." So, knowing it was wrong, they still followed the drawing to work, until the foundation was laid and the wall was砌 one meter high, and seeing that the loss would be even greater if they continued to do so, they resolutely raised the issue, and the design engineer accepted the opinion. Similar situations often occur in engineering construction.
　　The workers and technicians present expressed that they would cooperate well with the engineers in the future, expose various shortcomings in the construction project with the attitude of masters, resolutely change the irresponsible attitude of the past, and at the same time, they hoped that the technical personnel could also be conscientious and responsible in their work, unite with the workers, correct the shortcomings, and do a good job in basic construction.

　　建筑工人谈基本建设
　  ——记本报召开的建筑业工人座谈会
　　宋琤
    七月十六日，本报邀请北京市有经验的建筑工人和技术员座谈基本建设的设计问题和工人与技术人员的团结问题。参加者有某修建办事处的技术员于德胜、孙如锡、王学武，木工姚殿达、王海鹏，永茂建筑工程公司木工王大川，北京市建筑合作社联合社技术员刘泾洁，中国建筑企业公司北京分公司的宋建德等。
  工程设计为何发生错误？
    他们根据亲身的经验，认为工程设计之所以发生问题，就技术人员讲，主要的原因，还是对人民事业的责任心不强。（到会的都是现场的工作者，他们和工程委托者接触很少，因之只能就工程技术人员方面提出问题。）
  没有测量地基土壤耐压力
    责任心不强表现在很多方面。最主要的是在设计之前没有进行充分的调查研究。宋建德提出，土壤耐压力本是设计建筑物的重要根据之一。但是，有些工程师却不到现场对地基进行实地勘察，只是坐在房子里单凭书本上的理论作设计。今年中国建筑企业公司北京分公司接受委托给北京妇女干部学校建筑三座教室。到施工时，才发现要在上面建筑教室的高土台都是由垃圾堆成的，只好在地基上每隔零点八公尺打一根三公尺长四寸宽的桩子，然后做成洋灰地基。青年团中央修建三层的办公大楼，也是施工后才发现地下有垃圾，结果只好从地下把垃圾挖出，打成洋灰地基。王大川也提出了相同的材料：永茂建筑工程公司承揽建筑燕京饭店，事先未仔细调查地基情况，就把工地上原有的建筑物拆掉准备施工。施工开始，才发现地下不多深就有水，需要打数百根三公尺到五公尺长的桩子，然后做地基。但是，假如打这样的桩子，附近的建筑物就要遭受很大的震动。这项工程因此不得不停止，一千多工人停了好久没活干。
  没有把地基面积弄对
    测量地基的大小本不是一件艰难的工作，但是有的设计图样竟然和地基的大小不一致。宋建德举出了几个这样的例子。如今年北京市立第三医院修病房百余间，设计图样比地基长出半公尺。电影管理局剧本创作所宿舍设计图样比地基长出零点八公尺。这样，只好重新修改图样，延误了施工时间。
        建厂房没注意配合机器设备
    工厂厂房的建筑必须配合机器设备，有些建筑师在设计时却不注意这一问题，以致返工浪费。王大川提出：永茂建筑工程公司为国营光华染织厂建筑锅炉房，锅炉房的地基只能负重三吨。地基修筑了一半，才发现单只锅炉架子就有五吨重，锅炉根本放不进去，只好中途停工，至今这个问题还没解决。某修建办事处王学武也提出了同样的例子：去年，某修建办事处某工地建筑一座安装通讯机械的楼房，楼房的洋灰地板需要打眼，以便线路通过。设计人员没有完全掌握机械安装情况，就在图样上确定打眼一百多个。打成后有几十个眼因位置不对，需要在另外地方重打。这样不但浪费工时，并且减弱了建筑物的坚固程度。当时设计工程师不认为因为自己的设计不周密已经造成国家的浪费，还说这叫做“摸索经验”。
  对建筑物本身也没周密考虑
    有些工程师在绘制设计图样时甚至粗枝大叶，连对建筑物本身也没有做周密的计算。某修建办事处孙如锡、于德胜提出：他们正在为育英小学建筑一座楼房。因为楼房的窗口太大，沉陷力不平衡，以致墙壁发生裂缝。姚殿达和王海鹏又举出了育英小学修建大门的例子：铁门和门旁的洋灰柱子都是按照设计图样做的，结果铁门竟然宽出门口二十公分。光华染织厂的工程也有这样的情况。王大川说，他们为该厂建筑了一个食堂，但是设计者竟然未设计天窗。房子盖好了才发现了这个问题。只好再重开天窗。
    参加座谈会的同志都认为，这些大大小小的浪费完全不是什么客观困难所引起的，显然是由于设计者的不负责任。
  工人和技术人员如何团结？
    在座谈会中，大家还讨论了技术人员和工人互相轻视以致影响工作的问题。工程师们认为自己有理论，工人只会拉锯垒砖，不懂道理，因之把接受工人的意见当成“丢面子”的事。工人们同样也瞧不起技术人员。刘泾洁说，他们把技术人员叫做“书本先生”，说“把你们的英国本本、美国本本拿来也垒不出墙来”。有时候工人们又信心不足，怕提意见不被重视，或者怕自己提了别人的意见别人再向自己提意见。甚至明知不对，仍然照着做，抱着“做出来给你个不好看”的态度。大家对这个问题都进行了自我批评。王学武说，不管是技术人员或工人，这种互相瞧不起和爱面子的想法都不是从对人民负责的态度出发的。他和孙如锡举出了这样的例子：一九四九年某修建办事处某工地一个楼房的锅炉房，设计图样上的面积较应有的面积小了几乎三分之一，这样虽能按下锅炉，但不能拿火钩通火。施工的同志们向建筑师提出了问题，建筑师不肯接受。施工的工程师和工人就认为“犯不上跟你争论”，“等作好你就知道了”。于是明知不对，仍然照图做活，直到地脚打好，墙砌了一公尺多高，眼看着再做下去损失就要更大，才坚决提出，设计工程师也才接受了意见。类似这样的情况在工程建筑中时常发生。
    到会的工人和技术员们表示今后要很好地和工程师们团结合作，以主人翁的态度随时揭发建筑工程中的各种缺点，坚决改变过去的不负责任态度，同时提出，希望技术人员们在工作中也能认真负责，并和工人们团结起来，纠正缺点，把基本建设工作搞好。
