　　Merger of the Mongolian-Tibetan School and the Central Institute for Nationalities
    The Beijing Mongolian-Tibetan School has merged with the Central Institute for Nationalities and has been renamed the Middle School Affiliated to the Central Institute for Nationalities. At the celebration meeting for the merger of the two schools held on June 26th, all teachers and students unanimously expressed their support for this decision of the Central People's Government. The merger of the two schools will be more conducive to training cadres from minority nationalities, enabling the political, economic, and cultural construction of minority nationality areas to achieve rapid development.
