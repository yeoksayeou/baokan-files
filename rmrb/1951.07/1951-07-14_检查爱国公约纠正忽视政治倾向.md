  The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee Inspects Patriotic Pacts and Corrects Serious Formalism
    The CCP Lüda Municipal Committee conducted an in-depth inspection of the implementation of patriotic pacts in the city and discovered that due to the neglect of political work by the leaders of most enterprises and some regions, formalism has arisen in the formulation of patriotic pacts. According to the Lüda Municipal Committee's inspection of sixteen units (including thirteen factories, one seaport, one urban area, and one transportation company) around June 20, only three of these units performed relatively well, while the rest were merely formalities.
    The eastern district of the seaport, after hastily formulating a patriotic pact in April, never conducted a single inspection. On June 20, when the Municipal Committee sent people to inspect, they asked the workers, "Have you signed a patriotic pact?" The workers said, "What? We forgot about it long ago." They then asked the group leader, who said, "Yes! Yes!" When asked, "What did you sign?" he replied, "I can't remember!" They then asked, "Where is your pact?" He replied, "At the trade union!" The inspecting comrades asked the director of the trade union, who said, "There was something like that; let me find it." As a result, he searched for a long time before finding it. The situation at a certain machinery factory was even worse. The city's leading organs had instructed the formulation of patriotic pacts in early April, but all the leading cadres of the factory had forgotten about it. Only the director of the trade union remembered this matter on April 28. After remembering, he ran to the general branch secretary and said, "I almost forgot something important!" The general branch secretary asked, "What is it?" The director of the trade union said, "The higher authorities instructed that patriotic pacts should be formulated before May Day!" The general branch secretary said, "We're too busy; let's skip it!" This question made the general branch secretary feel that it was necessary to formulate one. So, the director of the trade union wrote a draft of a patriotic pact, read it to everyone the next day, and considered it formulated. A large pact was written for the May Day parade and placed in front of the procession, and after the parade, it was locked in the club. Until June 19, when the Municipal Committee sent people to inspect, the director of the trade union still said, "To be honest, I don't know how to formulate it? Of course, I didn't think about it carefully." The situation in the various neighborhoods of the Zhongshan District was even worse. In this district, most residents' group pacts were formulated by the group leader, the residents raised their hands, and they were handed over to the neighborhood (street), and it ended there. More seriously, after the National Anti-American and Aid-Korea Association issued three patriotic appeals in early June, the local Anti-American and Aid-Korea branch made plans, and the Municipal Committee mobilized and deployed, but most units still did not actively correct the above phenomena.
    The main reason for the above phenomena is that the leading comrades of these departments, although concerned about business, are not concerned about politics. They are not only not interested in general political activities, but they also reject this effective method of both enhancing the people's patriotic enthusiasm and promoting various specific tasks—patriotic pacts. After inspecting the above phenomena, the Lüda Municipal Committee has severely criticized the above units and specifically pointed out correction methods. At the same time, it also praised the units that have done better, such as the Chuanchu, Yuzhi No. 1 Factory, and Dalian Textile Factory.

  Northeast Discovers that Some Leading Cadres Neglect Political Work in the Inspection of Patriotic Pacts
    People from all walks of life in Northeast China have begun to inspect and revise patriotic pacts. The inspection found that wherever the leadership attaches importance, clearly explains the great political significance and role of signing patriotic pacts to the masses, inspires the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and undergoes full deliberation and discussion from bottom to top, practical patriotic pacts with specific and concise articles will be formulated. With the guarantee of a certain inspection system, significant achievements have been obtained. In contrast to the above situations and practices, there are few achievements, or they become mere documents. Many leading cadres put specific business and political work in opposition to each other, have insufficient understanding of this great creation of the people, do not pay attention to leadership, do not explain how to formulate them, and even prevent mass actions. For example, when the Haibei Distillery in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, popularized patriotic education in April, the workers were very enthusiastic, and various groups formulated patriotic pacts; however, the administration believed that the conditions proposed were different, making it difficult to inspect and award prizes, and were afraid of trouble. For example, the Changchun Power Supply Bureau's Material Warehouse also formulated a patriotic pact on May 24, but there was no full deliberation or discussion in advance, and the leaders did not explain the significance and methods of formulating the pact clearly. As a result, seven major articles and more than seventy minor items were formulated, and once formulated, they were forgotten, becoming a dead letter. In addition, the lack of an inspection system and the lack of criticism and self-criticism have also affected the implementation of patriotic pacts.

  Xi'an机关干部执行爱国公约克服了许多单位的主要缺点
    Three thousand cadres from various agencies and units in Xi'an revised and conscientiously implemented patriotic pacts.
    In February of this year, when the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all agencies to generally formulate patriotic pacts, many cadres thought it was unnecessary. Some Communist Party members even thought, "The Party Constitution is a patriotic pact, why bother formulating another one?" The CCP branches of various agencies cooperated with the administrative leadership to convene various meetings in the agencies for mobilization and organized discussions to eliminate the above ideological obstacles. The movement to formulate patriotic pacts gradually unfolded.
    The principle of conscious voluntarism was implemented in each unit from the beginning of the formulation of the pact. Organs such as the Municipal People's Government Real Estate Bureau and the Labor Bureau first proposed patriotic codes of conduct by individuals, submitted them to the study group meeting for discussion and supplementation, and then discussed and formulated the patriotic pacts of the entire department and bureau from the bottom up; at the same time, they organized patriotic pact inspection committees and inspection teams to be responsible for supervision and inspection. However, when a general inspection was carried out in various agencies in early April, it was found that the articles of the patriotic pact were very unspecific and were mostly not formulated based on the actual situation, so the patriotic pact did not play its due role. Everyone began to realize that the patriotic pacts of the agencies must be formulated based on the main shortcomings of the unit and based on the personal patriotic code of conduct. The various agencies then generally revised the patriotic pacts. The Mediation Section of the Municipal Labor Bureau was slack and disorganized. Since the revision of the patriotic pact, the staff who used to be late and leave early have been arriving and leaving on time; those who used to gossip during work no longer waste time, and the work efficiency of the section in April was more than three times higher than before the revision of the pact. The Business Department of the Municipal People's Bank used to work overtime until 12:00 at night. When revising the pact, everyone focused on reviewing the individualistic thinking of "not being related to each other" and stipulated in the pact "helping each other and leaving work at the same time." In April, the department reduced overtime pay by 101 million yuan compared to March. Each agency has also made achievements in keeping state secrets, preventing spies, and eliminating special agents. Many cadres have strictly abided by the confidentiality clauses in the patriotic pact, such as "do not ask about things that should not be known, and do not say things that should not be said to outsiders." The phenomena of some agency cadres carelessly putting away documents and casually receiving guests, which did not pay attention to confidentiality, have been greatly reduced. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, an agency exposed twenty-seven special agents hiding in the city.

### 检查爱国公约纠正忽视政治倾向

　　检查爱国公约纠正忽视政治倾向
  中共旅大市委检查爱国公约纠正严重的形式主义现象
    中共旅大市委深入检查该市爱国公约执行情形，发现由于多数企业单位和某些地区的领导干部，忽视政治工作，因此在订立爱国公约中，产生了形式主义的现象。据旅大市委六月二十日前后对十六个单位（包括十三个工厂、一个海港、一个市区、一个交通公司）的检查，在这些单位中，作得较好的只有三个，其余均是徒具形式。
    海港东区，自四月份马马虎虎地订立爱国公约之后，从未检查一次。六月二十日，市委派人去检查时，问工人：“你们订了爱国公约没有？”工人说：“什么？早就忘了。”又问小组长，小组长说：“订了！订了！”再问：“订的什么？”答：“记不得了！”又问：“你们公约在什么地方？”答：“在工会！”检查的同志去问工会主任，工会主任说：“有那么回事，我给找找。”结果，他翻了很久，才找出来。机械某厂的情况就更糟了。市的领导机关，在四月初就曾指示订立爱国公约，但该厂的所有领导干部全都忘了。只有工会主任直到四月二十八日才想起这件事来。想起之后便跑到总支书记那里说：“差点忘了大事情！”总支书记问：“什么事？”工会主任说：“上级指示说五一前要订爱国公约！”总支书记说：“太忙啦，抗过去吧！”工会主任说：“那五一游行用啥？”这一问才使总支书记感到有订的必要。于是工会主任就写了一个爱国公约草案，第二天向大家宣读了一下，就算订了。“五一”游行时写了一张大的公约摆在队伍前面，游行后便锁进俱乐部里去了。直到六月十九日，市委派人去检查时，工会主任还说：“说实话，我就不知怎么订？当然也没好好想。”中山区各坊的情况就更差，这区多数居民小组公约都是组长订好，居民举手，交到坊（街）上，从此完结。更严重的是：在六月初全国抗美援朝总会发出三项爱国号召后，当地抗美援朝分会作了计划，市委作了动员和布置，但大多数单位对上述现象仍未主动去纠正。
    所以产生上述现象的主要原因是：这些部门的领导同志，虽关心业务，但不关心政治，不但对一般政治活动不发生兴趣，就是对这一既能提高人民爱国热情，又能推动各项具体工作的有效办法——爱国公约，也拒之门外。旅大市委在检查出上述现象后，已向上述单位提出严重批评，并具体指出纠正办法。与此同时又表扬了船渠、油脂一厂、大连纺织厂等做得较好的单位。

  东北在检查爱国公约中发现部分领导干部忽视政治工作
    东北各地各界人民开始检查和修订爱国公约。在检查中发现，凡是领导重视，向群众交代清楚订爱国公约的重大政治意义和作用，激发群众的爱国热情，经过自下而上的充分酝酿、讨论，就会订出切合实际的、条文具体简明的爱国公约，加上一定的检查制度的保证，都获得了显著的成绩。与上述相反的情形和作法，成绩就很少，或形成具文。有不少领导干部，把具体业务和政治工作对立起来，对于这一人民群众伟大的创造认识不足，既不注意领导，也不交代如何订法，甚至还阻止群众行动。如黑龙江省海伦县海北制酒厂在四月份普及爱国教育的时候，工友们热情很高，各小组纷纷订立了爱国公约；但行政上认为提出的条件不一样，不好检查和评奖，怕麻烦。又如长春电业局器材库，在五月二十四日也订立了爱国公约，但事先既没有充分酝酿讨论，领导也没讲清订公约的意义和方法，结果订了七大条七十多小项，订过也就忘了，成为一纸空文。另外，没有检查制度，缺乏批评和自我批评，也影响了爱国公约的贯彻执行。

  西安机关干部执行爱国公约克服了许多单位的主要缺点
    西安市各机关单位的三千多干部修订并认真执行了爱国公约。
    今年二月间，当中国共产党西安市委员会号召各机关普遍订立爱国公约时，许多干部以为没有必要。有些共产党员甚至以为：“党章就是爱国公约，何必再订？”各机关的中共支部配合行政领导方面在机关内召集各种会议进行动员，并组织讨论，扫除了上述思想上的障碍。订立爱国公约的运动于是逐步展开。
    各单位在开始订立公约时，即贯彻了自觉自愿的原则。市人民政府房地局、劳动局等机关都是先由个人提出爱国守则，交学习小组会讨论补充，然后再由下而上地讨论和订立全科、全局的爱国公约；同时并组织爱国公约检查委员会和检查小组，负责督促与检查。但在四月初各机关普遍进行检查时，发现爱国公约的条文很不具体，且大都不是根据实际情况订立的，所以爱国公约未曾发挥应有的作用。大家开始认识到机关爱国公约，必须针对本单位的主要缺点，以个人爱国守则为基础来订立。各机关随即普遍修订了爱国公约。市劳动局调处科工作松懈散漫，自修订爱国公约后，过去迟到早退的工作人员按时上班、下班了；过去在工作时好说闲话的人也不再旷废时间了，该科四月份工作效率比修订公约前提高了三倍以上。市人民银行营业部过去经常加班到夜十二点钟，在修订公约时，每个人着重检讨了“互不相关”的个人主义思想，在公约中规定了“互相帮助，同时下班”。四月份该部即比三月份减少了加班费一亿零一百万元。各机关在保守国家机密、防奸细肃清特务方面，也做出了成绩。许多干部都已严格遵守爱国公约中“不应知道的事不问、不应向外讲的话不讲”等保密条文，某些机关干部乱放文件，随便接待客人等不注意保密的现象已大为减少。某机关在镇压反革命运动中，检举了二十七个隐蔽在本市的特务分子。
