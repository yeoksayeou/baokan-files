　　The Drinking Water Problem of the Masses in Fengfeng Village
　  Should be Quickly Solved by the Fengfeng Mining Bureau of Hebei Province
    The masses in Fengfeng Village near the Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei Province originally drank live water, but the water source was cut off due to coal mining. After discussions between the local government and the Fengfeng Mine, it was decided that the Mining Bureau would be responsible for supplying drinking water to the villagers through water pipes.

    After the installation of the water pipes, the amount of water delivered each day was initially sufficient for the villagers. However, during the cotton planting season this spring, the Mining Bureau, fearing that the villagers would use the water from the pipes to irrigate their cotton fields, reduced the water delivery time and volume. As a result, there were often many people and sixty or seventy water buckets waiting for water around the water pipes. Some people could barely get even one load of water in a whole day. The masses were very dissatisfied with this and wanted to go to the Mining Bureau to petition, but they were dissuaded by the local government cadres who explained the situation well to them. The Party Committee of the Fengfeng Mining Area of the Chinese Communist Party had notified the Party Committee of the Fengfeng Coal Mine by telephone several times, urging them to resolve the issue quickly. The Party Committee of the Coal Mine paid no attention to this problem. The Party Committee of the Mining Area then called the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau, but they only said that they would send someone to Fengfeng Village to take a look. This matter has been delayed for three months and has not yet been resolved.

    During these three months, the masses in Fengfeng Village have enthusiastically launched a patriotic production increase movement, but because of the lack of drinking water, sixty to seventy laborers are delayed from participating in production every day, causing great losses to the masses. Now it is the hot summer season, and the lack of drinking water is seriously harming their health. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau and the Party Committee of the Coal Mine should quickly resolve the drinking water problem of the masses in Fengfeng Village and conduct a public self-criticism.
                Fengfeng Mining Area Party Committee Wang Yang
    Editor's Note: The Fengfeng Mining Bureau and the Party Committee of the Coal Mine have been so slow and indifferent to the drinking water problem, which seriously affects the production and life of the masses in Fengfeng Village, creating a very bad impression among the masses and hindering the unity of the local workers and peasants. In response, the Party Committee and administrative leaders of the mine should conduct a self-examination ideologically, apologize to the masses, and quickly solve the drinking water problem of the masses.

　　峰峰村群众的吃水问题
　  河北省峰峰矿务局应迅速解决
    河北省峰峰煤矿附近峰峰村的群众，原吃的是活水，后来由于煤矿的开采，使水源断绝。经当地政府和峰峰矿商讨结果，决定由矿务局负责按水管子供给该村群众吃水。
    按装水管后，最初每天送的水还够群众用。但在今春种棉时期，矿务局怕群众用水管里的水浇种棉花，减少送水时间和送水量。这样一来，水管周围，经常有很多人和六七十付水桶在等水。有的人一天几乎连一担水都等不上。群众对这事很不满意，要到矿务局去请愿，因有当地区政府干部很好地向群众解释，才没这样作。对这件事，中共峰峰矿区党委会曾用电话数次通知峰峰煤矿党委会，让他们快点解决。煤矿党委会对此问题毫不重视。矿区党委会又给矿务局领导干部打电话，而他们只说派人去峰峰村看看，而此事已拖延了三个月仍未解决。
    在这三个月当中，峰峰村群众热烈地掀起了爱国丰产运动，但因为缺水吃，每天要耽误六、七十个劳力不能参加生产，使群众受到很大损失。现在正在夏热天，群众缺水吃，更严重地损害着他们的身体健康。峰峰矿务局及煤矿党委会对峰峰村群众吃水问题应迅速解决并公开进行检讨。
                峰峰矿区党委会  汪洋
    编者按：峰峰矿务局及煤矿党委会对严重影响峰峰村群众生产、生活的吃水问题，竟是如此拖延，漠不关心，在群众中造成极恶劣的印象，妨碍了当地工农群众的团结。对此，该矿党委和行政领导上应从思想上进行检查，向群众道歉，并迅速解决群众吃水问题。
