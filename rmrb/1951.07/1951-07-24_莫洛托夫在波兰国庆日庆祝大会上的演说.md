Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd (TASS): Molotov delivered a speech at the celebration meeting in Warsaw marking the seventh anniversary of Poland's revival. The speech is as follows:

　　Comrades! The Soviet delegation, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), on behalf of the Soviet people, the Soviet armed forces, and Comrade Stalin himself, extends fraternal greetings and heartfelt congratulations to all of you and to all the Polish people on this celebration of the seventh anniversary of Poland's revival.

　　(Prolonged stormy applause. All stand. Cheers of "Long live Stalin!" are incessant.)

　　Seven years ago, a new page was opened in the history of the Polish people, and Poland's true national and social revival began. The beginning of the new history of the Polish state should be traced back to the day the Polish Committee of National Liberation was established.

　　When the Soviet army advanced irresistibly, and the fighting troops of the new Polish army marched alongside the Soviet army, when Poland began to be liberated from Fascist occupation, a large part of Poland's territory was still occupied by the Hitler bandits, and the people of the Soviet Union and Poland were still shedding blood on the front lines of the anti-aggression struggle. Towns and villages were engulfed in flames, set ablaze by the retreating invading armies. At this time, the establishment of the Polish Committee of National Liberation brilliantly illuminated the path for the Polish people towards freedom, national independence, and social revival.

　　Seven years ago, the Polish working class, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, became the leading force of the Polish people. The Polish working class, from a class enslaved and exploited under the old bourgeois and landlord rule, became the creator of the new people's democratic state. The Polish working class, together with the laboring peasants and representatives of democratic intellectuals, united the best forces among the Polish people and began to build a new, truly democratic state.

　　The Polish Workers' Party, now the United Workers' Party, has united the Polish working class, the best forces of the Polish people, in the fighting ranks led by the outstanding leader Comrade Bierut. (Prolonged applause, the entire audience stands) Today, everyone recognizes that this party has chosen the correct path for the revival of the motherland. Everyone knows that the main problem facing the new regime before was the issue of land for the peasants. The Polish People's Democratic government confiscated the landlords' land and handed it over to the peasants, thus resolving this major issue in favor of the people, and thereby ensuring the further achievements of the new regime. It decisively satisfied the hopes that the peasants had cherished for many years, and thus gained the faith of the peasant masses. Since then, the People's Democratic government has quickly consolidated itself and gained the full support of the majority of the people. It is also understandable that the most outstanding members of the intelligentsia began to stand confidently on the side of the new People's Democratic regime.

　　All these created the conditions for the rapid economic and political revival of the Polish state. The Polish people victoriously completed the task of implementing the first three-year plan for economic revival. As a result, industry developed rapidly, and by 1949, industrial output had doubled the pre-war level. Agricultural output also increased significantly.

　　After completing the three-year plan ahead of schedule, the Polish people have embarked on the implementation of the six-year plan they have adopted. The work in the second year of the six-year plan is now proceeding smoothly. By the end of the six-year period, the completion of this plan will enable industrial output to increase two and a half times and agricultural output to increase by fifty percent.

　　Such a huge task can only be undertaken because the Polish People's Democratic regime implemented a revolutionary land reform, handing over the landlords' land to the peasants, nationalizing large and medium-sized industries, transportation, and banks, and establishing a monopoly on foreign trade. In this way, the foundations of capitalism and the system of exploiting the people were uprooted. This means that Poland has resolutely embarked on the road of socialist construction, the road of establishing socialist foundations. (Applause)

　　We, the Soviet people, know very well that to complete such a huge task places enormous responsibilities on the working class, the laboring peasants, the progressive intellectuals, and especially the leading forces of the Polish state, first and foremost, on the United Workers' Party, which is leading the construction of socialism in the Polish Republic.

　　We know from our own experience that the class enemies in cities and villages, especially the rich peasants, will continue to attempt to obstruct and hinder the Polish people from advancing to socialism. We must not forget for a minute that the governments of various imperialist countries are using all means and all kinds of sabotage and despicable methods to send as many spies they employ into our countries as possible. They are sparing no expense in sending spies, traitors, and provocateurs into our countries.

　　But we also know that the workers and peasants of Poland have already come a long way in building a people's democratic state and have accumulated a lot of practical experience, so they will surely victoriously complete the work they face and advance confidently towards the victory of socialism. (Applause) The strong pillar of People's Democratic Poland on this road was, is, and will always be the alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and the Polish Republic. (Stormy applause lasting a long time)

　　Comrades, you know that six years ago, Poland and the Soviet Union signed a treaty, namely the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation. Because Comrade Stalin signed on behalf of the Soviet Union, the political significance of this treaty became even more significant. (Thunderous cheers in tribute to Comrade Stalin, the entire audience rises, shouts of "Stalin!" erupt) Comrade Stalin explained the great historical significance of the Soviet-Polish treaty at the time of signing, this treaty formally affirmed the already existing unwritten alliance and friendship between the Soviet state and People's Democratic Poland. Comrade Stalin said at the time, "The importance of this treaty lies primarily in the fact that it marks a fundamental shift in Soviet-Polish relations towards alliance and friendship, a shift that arose in the current struggle for liberation against Germany, and is now formally confirmed in this treaty.

　　Everyone knows that for five centuries, the relations between our two countries have been filled with mutual alienation and unfriendly elements, and open military conflicts have often occurred between the two countries. This relationship weakened both of our countries and strengthened German imperialism.

　　The importance of the current treaty lies in the fact that it ends those old relations between our two countries, nails it in the coffin, and creates a true foundation to replace the past unfriendly relations with relations of Soviet-Polish alliance and friendship."

　　The unfriendly relations that have existed between our two countries for five centuries are historical remnants of the relationship between Tsarist and landlord Old Russia and noble-landlord Old Poland. Of course, in the past, there were also outstanding people of both nations who were able to find common ground, support each other, and strive to create conditions for the development of good neighborly and friendly relations between our two peoples. However, for many centuries, these relations were not adjusted, and open military conflicts often occurred, causing many disasters to the people of our two countries. Everyone knows that Poland, the Polish people, and the Ukrainian and Belarusian peoples suffered particularly deeply.

　　At the time of signing the Soviet-Polish treaty, Comrade Stalin also said: "In the past twenty-five to thirty years, that is, during the past two world wars, Germany used Polish territory as a corridor for aggression in the East and a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union. This was able to happen because there was no relationship of friendship and alliance between our two countries at that time. The former rulers of Poland did not want to have an alliance relationship with the Soviet Union. They adopted a policy of sowing discord between Germany and the Soviet Union. Of course, they failed… Poland was occupied, and Polish independence was lost; due to this fatal policy, German troops had the opportunity to reach the suburbs of Moscow."

　　"The importance of the current treaty lies in the fact that it abolishes the fatal policy of sowing discord between Germany and the Soviet Union in the past, and replaces it with a policy of alliance and friendship between Poland and its eastern neighbor."

　　These clear words of Comrade Stalin summarize the history of the period including the two world wars. In the First and Second World Wars, Poland was a corridor for German imperialism to invade the East and attack the Soviet Union. Even later, when the October Socialist Revolution triumphed in Russia, and the Soviet government declared unconditional recognition of Poland's sovereignty and independence, and expressed its willingness to establish good neighborly relations, the rulers of Poland at that time were unwilling to establish a friendly alliance relationship with the Soviet Union. They sowed discord between Germany and the Soviet Union, but they miscalculated miserably. The first victim of this mistake was Poland itself, the Polish people who were deprived of the opportunity to intervene in national affairs at that time.

　　Comrade Stalin also pointed out the great importance of the Soviet-Polish treaty signed on April 21, 1945. He said at the time: "When there was no alliance between our two countries, Germany was able to take advantage of the lack of a united front between us; it was able to sow discord between Poland and the Soviet Union and then defeat them one by one. After the establishment of an alliance between our two countries, the situation has fundamentally changed. It is no longer possible to sow discord between our two countries now. Our two countries now have a united front from the Baltic Sea to the Carpathian Mountains to guard against a common enemy, to guard against German imperialism." (Applause)

　　It has been six years since the signing of the Soviet-Polish treaty. In these years, the alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and Poland have been further consolidated, and the relationship between our two countries has become closer. Other important changes have also taken place. During this period, the German Democratic Republic was established and established friendly relations with the Soviet Union and Poland (applause). Now, Poland's neighbors are the Soviet Union, People's Democratic Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, Poland is bordered only by friendly neighbors, which has never happened in Polish history, thus opening up favorable prospects for Poland.

　　The development of Soviet-Polish relations in recent years fully confirms the great significance of the fundamental change in Soviet-Polish relations, which is the result of the establishment of friendship and alliance between our two countries.

　　Since Poland became a people's democratic country and was liberated from the rule of landlords and capitalists, there has been a lasting friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland - a brotherly cooperative relationship in all aspects of economic, cultural, and political life, as well as in international activities. Even judging by the situation of the short period that has passed, the achievements of this cooperation have certainly proved that this relationship is developing in a direction that is beneficial to both countries.

　　In the past, under the bourgeois and landlord system, Poland's economy was declining, industry often suffered devastating crises, and the working class and laboring intellectuals suffered various pains of unemployment. Peasants had to live in poverty with no hope for the future. In terms of foreign economic relations, bourgeois and landlord Poland was completely dependent on the major capitalist countries, dependent on the unstable capitalist market, and, in pursuit of its anti-Soviet goals, it fundamentally did not want to have trade relations with the Soviet Union. The situation even developed to the point where, in 1938, the amount of trade between Poland and the Soviet Union was almost zero, which clearly caused significant losses to Poland.

　　Now, under the People's Democratic system, Poland is advancing along the road of rapid and continuous economic development. Heavy and light industries are expanding. Poland's policy of socialist industrialization is being implemented. The welfare of the working class is constantly improving. Agriculture is also developing. The development of agricultural production cooperatives has begun, and they are receiving increasing help from the state in the form of tractors and agricultural machinery, which are necessary for organizing large-scale cooperative agriculture. The welfare of the peasants has greatly improved compared to the pre-war level. The possibility of supplying urban residents with agricultural products and supplying industry with agricultural raw materials is greater.

　　The fact that Poland has established close economic relations with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries is of great significance for Poland's economic development. With these relations, Poland can receive reliable and increasing assistance from the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, thereby confidently planning the development of its national economy.

　　It is enough to point out that since the end of the war, trade between Poland and the Soviet Union has increased fivefold, and now the scale of their trade is commensurate with the scale of economic development of a large country.

　　Cooperation between Poland and the Soviet Union is developing along many aspects. In addition to trade relations, our two countries are becoming increasingly close in terms of the exchange of technology and production experience, cultural ties, and strengthening ties between scientific and artistic workers, and youth and women's organizations. Since the Soviet Union has already established a socialist society and has rich experience in socialist construction, this close relationship between our two countries is of particular importance for the victory of socialist construction in Poland. (Applause)

　　All this has become possible and can be realized because the relations between our two countries are now developing on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism, on the basis of the Lenin-Stalin principles. Guided by these principles, comprehensive cooperation has been established and is being consolidated among the countries liberated from capitalist enslavement. This cooperation is based on the recognition of the equality of rights of large and small countries, brotherly mutual assistance, and the common struggle for the victory of socialism under the banner of Lenin-Stalin. (Prolonged loud applause)

　　Everyone has seen the fate of Yugoslavia. This country has been deceived and fallen into the hands of a group of spies and traitors who have betrayed their own people and sold themselves to American and British imperialism. Now everyone sees that the Tito-Kardelj-Ranković clique has restored the capitalist order in Yugoslavia, deprived the people of all revolutionary achievements, and turned Yugoslavia into a tool of aggressive imperialist countries. This group of power-grabbing, profit-seeking criminals knows that the Yugoslav people hate them deeply and can only maintain their regime through bloody terror and fascist rule to this day. But this cannot be maintained for long. The Yugoslav people will surely find a way to freedom and eliminate the Tito fascist regime. (Applause)

　　From this we can see that we must beware of the enemies disguised as proletarian internationalism, and freedom-loving people must be loyal to the Leninist-Stalinist principles of internationalism from beginning to end, and defend this foundation of brotherly cooperation between countries. (Prolonged applause)

　　Now, when the American and British imperialist state groups are adopting a policy of openly preparing for a new world war, and even openly taking aggressive actions, the friendship and alliance between the Soviet Union and Poland are of great significance for defending peace.

　　We cannot ignore that the countries of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization have embarked on the road of expanding armaments without restraint, and the United States is establishing more and more military bases in Europe and the Near East. This makes the threat of war even more serious. The American and British imperialists, together with their French and other vassal states, have begun to rearm West Germany and begin to restore Japanese militarism. They are hastily implementing these hopeless adventurous plans, regardless of blatantly violating international agreements.

　　However, this cannot hide the fact that the internal contradictions between the countries within the imperialist camp have become increasingly sharp, and at the same time, the struggle between the ruling groups of various countries has become more and more intense.

　　In this situation, the people of all countries must not only remain vigilant, but also raise their vigilance as much as possible to stop war and defend peace. Only in this way can we obtain reliable guarantees for lasting peace.

　　In recent years, the camp of peaceful countries has greatly strengthened. The People's Democratic countries and such a powerful new ally as the People's Republic of China are jointly fighting to defend peace together with the Soviet Union. (Long applause) In capitalist countries, in the West and the East, the peace movement is rising day by day. It is precisely for this reason that the voice of the Soviet representative calling for an end to hostilities in Korea and the implementation of a ceasefire has received such a powerful response.

　　In these years, the friendship and alliance between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Poland have also been strengthened. The Soviet-Polish friendship laid by the great Stalin has become the foundation of the brotherly alliance between the people of the Soviet Union and Poland (stormy applause). The people of our two countries are advancing under a common banner towards a common goal. The dreams of those glorious leaders of the working class in history who fought for the realization of socialism, like Dzerzhinsky, who was appropriately praised by Comrade Stalin as a hero of October and also a great patriot of Poland, are now realized.

　　As the new history of the Polish people enters its eighth year, the Soviet delegation warmly congratulates the People's Democratic Poland, which is building a socialist society and defending the cause of peace, on achieving more success. Long live the inviolable friendship and brotherly alliance between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Poland! (Prolonged stormy cheers. All rise. The entire audience cheers for Comrade Stalin and Comrade Bierut for a long time). Long live the Polish people and their President Bierut! (The entire audience rises, thunderous cheers lasting a long time)

　　莫洛托夫在波兰国庆日庆祝大会上的演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙二十二日电：莫洛托夫在华沙庆祝波兰复兴七周年的纪念大会上发表演说。讲辞如下：
    同志们！苏联代表团谨代表苏联政府和苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会，代表苏联人民、苏联武装部队和斯大林同志本人，在这波兰复兴七周年庆祝大会上，向各位以及波兰全体人民致兄弟的敬礼和衷心的祝贺。
    （长久的暴风雨般的掌声。全体起立。斯大林万岁的欢呼声历久不息）
    七年以前，波兰人民的历史揭开了新的一页，波兰真正的民族和社会复兴开始了。波兰国家新历史的开始，应该回溯到波兰民族解放委员会成立的日子。
    当苏联军队势不可当地推进，新波兰军的战斗部队与苏军并肩前进，波兰开始从法西斯占领之下解放出来的时候，波兰的一大部分国土仍然被希特勒匪徒占领着，苏联和波兰两国人民仍然在反侵略斗争的战线上流着血，城镇和乡村被退却中的侵略军队纵火焚烧而火烟弥漫。正在这个时候，波兰民族解放委员会的成立，光辉地照亮了波兰人民走向自由、民族独立和社会复兴的道路。
    七年前，波兰的工人阶级在工人党的领导之下成了波兰人民的领导力量。波兰工人阶级由旧日资产阶级和地主统治下被奴役被剥削的阶级，变成了新的人民民主国家的缔造者。波兰工人阶级与劳动农民和民主知识分子的代表一道团结了波兰人民中的最优秀的力量，并开始建设新的真正民主的国家。
    波兰人民的工人党，即现在的统一工人党，已经把波兰工人阶级的，波兰人民的最优秀的力量团结在杰出领袖贝鲁特同志所领导的战斗行列中。（掌声历久不息，全场起立）今天，每个人都认识到，这个党选择了复兴祖国的正确道路。大家知道，以前摆在新政权面前的主要问题就是把土地给农民的问题。波兰人民民主政府没收了地主的土地交给农民，从而把这一主要问题作了有利于人民的解决，并由此保证了新政权的进一步成就。它果敢地满足了农民们所多年怀想的希望，因此得到了农民群众的信仰。自那时起，人民民主政府便很快地巩固起来，获得了大多数人民的充分拥护。知识分子中的最优秀的人士开始满怀信心地站到新人民民主政权方面来，这也是可以了解的。
    所有这些，都为波兰国家经济上和政治上的迅速复兴创造了条件。波兰人民胜利地完成了执行第一个经济复兴三年计划的任务。其结果使工业迅速地发展起来，到一九四九年，工业产量已经增为战前水平的两倍。农业产量也大为增加了。
    波兰人民在提前完成了三年计划之后，已着手去执行他们所通过的六年计划。六年计划第二年的工作现在正在顺利地进行。到六年时期终了时，完成这个计划就可使工业产量增加两倍半，农业产量增加百分之五十。
    这样巨大的任务之所以能够承担下来，只是由于波兰人民民主的政权实行了革命的土地改革，把地主的土地交给了农民，把大中型的工业、运输和银行收归国有，建立了对外贸易的专营。这样，资本主义和剥削人民的制度的根基就被拔除了。这就是说波兰已坚决地走上了社会主义建设的道路，走上了建立社会主义基础的道路。（掌声）
    我们苏联人民知道得很清楚：要完成这样巨大的任务就使得工人阶级、劳动农民、进步知识分子，特别是波兰国家的领导力量，首先是在波兰共和国领导建设社会主义的统一工人党负起巨大的责任。
    我们从自己的经验知道：城市和乡村的阶级敌人，特别是富农，将继续企图阻止和妨碍波兰人民前进到社会主义。我们一分钟也不能忘记，各帝国主义国家的政府正在用一切办法和各种各样的破坏和卑鄙的手段，把它们所雇用的特务尽量派到我们的国家来，它们正不惜花钱把间谍、奸细和挑拨者派到我们的国家来。
    但是我们还知道，波兰的工人和农民在建设人民民主国家方面，已经走过了相当长的一段路，而且积累了许多实际经验，因此他们一定会胜利地完成他们所面临的工作，而且充满信心地向着社会主义的胜利前进。（掌声）人民民主波兰在这条道路上的坚强的支柱过去是，现在是，将来还是苏联和波兰共和国的同盟与友谊。（暴风雨般的掌声经久不息）
    同志们，你们知道，六年以前，波兰和苏联签订了条约，这就是友好互助与战后合作条约。由于斯大林同志代表苏联方面签字，这个条约的政治意义就更加显著了。（向斯大林同志致敬的欢呼声雷动，全体起立，欢呼“斯大林！”的声音四起）斯大林同志在签字的时候说明了苏波条约的伟大历史意义，这个条约把苏维埃国家和人民民主波兰之间已经存在的不成文的同盟和友好正式确定了。斯大林同志当时说，“这个条约的重要性首先在于，它标志着苏波关系根本转变而走向同盟与友好，这个转变是在当前的争取解放反对德国的斗争过程中产生的，现在把它在这个条约里正式加以确定。
    大家都知道，五个世纪以来，我们两国的关系充满着互相疏远和不友好的成分，而且两国间常常发生公开的军事冲突。这种关系使得我们两个国家都削弱了，而加强了德国帝国主义。
    目前条约的重要性是在于它结束了我们两国之间的那些旧关系，把它钉在棺材里面，并且创造了真正的基础，以苏波同盟与友好的关系来代替过去不友好的关系。”
    五个世纪以来存在于我们两国之间的不友好关系，已是沙皇与地主的旧俄罗斯和贵族地主的旧波兰之间的关系的历史陈迹了。当然，在过去，两个民族也有优秀的人民能够找到共同的见解，互相支援，努力创造我们两国人民之间的善邻友好关系的发展的条件。但是，许多世纪以来，这些关系没有得到调整，公开军事冲突常常发生，使我们两国人民遭到了许多灾难。大家知道，波兰，波兰人民以及乌克兰人民与白俄罗斯人民遭到的痛苦特别深重。
    在签订苏波条约时，斯大林同志并且说过：“在过去二十五年至三十年间，也就是过去两次世界大战中，德国利用了波兰领土作为侵略东方的走廊和进攻苏联的跳板。这种事情之所以能够发生，是因为当时我们两国之间没有友好与同盟的关系。波兰以前的统治者不希望与苏联有同盟的关系。他们采取了在德苏之间搬弄是非的政策。当然，他们失败了……波兰被占领了，波兰的独立丧失了；由于这个致命的政策，德国军队才有机会到达莫斯科城郊。”
    “目前条约的重要性是在于它废除了过去的在德苏之间搬弄是非的致命的政策，而代之以波兰与其东方邻国联盟与友好的政策。”
    斯大林同志的这些明确的话，概括了这个包括两次世界大战在内的时期的历史。在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战中，波兰都是德帝国主义侵略东方和进攻苏联的走廊。甚至在后来，当十月社会主义革命在俄罗斯胜利了，苏维埃政府宣布无条件承认波兰的主权与独立，并且表示愿意建立善邻的关系的时候，当时波兰的统治者却不愿建立与苏联友好同盟的关系。他们在德苏之间搬弄是非，但是他们可悲地盘算错了。这个错误的第一个牺牲者是波兰自身，是当时被剥夺了干预国事的机会的波兰人民。
    斯大林同志并且指出了在一九四五年四月二十一日签订的苏波条约的巨大重要性。他当时说：“在我们两国之间没有联盟的时候，德国能够利用我们之间的没有联合阵线；它能够挑拨波兰与苏联的关系，然后逐个击破。在我们两国之间建立了联盟以后，形势根本改变了。现在不再有可能挑拨我们两国关系了。我们两国现在有了从波罗的海到喀尔巴阡山的联合阵线以防范共同的敌人，防范德帝国主义。”（掌声）
    自从苏波条约签订以来，已经有六年了。在这几年，苏联与波兰之间的同盟与友谊更巩固了，我们两国之间的关系更密切了。其他的重要变化也发生了。在这个时期，德意志民主共和国成立了，而且与苏联及波兰建立了友好关系（鼓掌）。现在，波兰的邻国是苏联，人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克及德意志民主共和国。因此，与波兰接壤的尽是友好的邻国，这是波兰历史上不曾有过的事，这样就给波兰开辟了有利的前途。
    最近几年来苏波关系的发展，充分证实了苏波关系根本改变的重大意义，这种改变是我们两国之间建立了友谊与同盟的结果。
    自从波兰成为人民民主国家并从地主与资本家的统治下获得解放以来，苏联与波兰之间就已存在着持久的友好关系——在经济、文化及政治生活的各方面、以及在国际活动场合中的兄弟般合作关系。甚至仅就已经过去的短短一段时期的情形而论，这种合作的成绩也肯定地证明了：这种关系正朝着对两国都有利的方向发展。
    过去，在资产阶级与地主制度之下，波兰的经济是下降的，工业时常遭受灾难深重的危机，并使工人阶级与劳动知识分子遭受了失业的各种痛苦。农民不得不在贫困中生活，对将来毫无希望。在对外经济关系上，资产阶级与地主的波兰完全倚赖主要的资本主义国家，倚赖不稳定的资本主义市场，而且，为了追求它的反苏目的，它根本不希望与苏联发生贸易关系。局势甚至发展到这样的地步，在一九三八年，波兰与苏联的贸易数量几乎等于零，这显然使波兰受到了重大的损失。
    现在，在人民民主制度之下，波兰正沿着迅速的、不断的经济发展的道路前进。重工业与轻工业都在扩充。波兰的社会主义工业化的政策正在实施。工人阶级的福利不断地增进。农业也在发展。农业生产合作社的发展已经开始，它们得到国家供给拖拉机与农业机械这类帮助正越来越多，而这些都是组织大规模的合作农业所必须的。农民的福利和战前的水平比较起来已大有改进。以农产品供给都市居民、以农业原料供给工业的可能性更大了。
    波兰与苏联及各人民民主国家间已经建立了密切的经济关系，这一事实对于波兰的经济发展具有重大意义。有了这些关系，波兰就可以从苏联及各人民民主国家得到可靠的、日渐增加的帮助，从而充满信心地计划它的国家经济的发展了。
    只消指出这一点就够了：自战争结束以来，波兰和苏联间的贸易已增加到五倍，现在它们的贸易的规模已和一个大国经济发展的规模相称了。
    波兰和苏联间的合作正沿着许多方面在发展。除了贸易关系外，在技术和生产经验的交流方面，我们两国间的文化联系，加强科学和艺术工作者、青年妇女团体间的联系方面，就越来越紧密了。由于苏联已经建立了社会主义社会，它在社会主义建设方面有着丰富的经验，所以我们两国间这种亲密的关系，对于波兰社会主义建设的胜利具有特别重要的意义的。（鼓掌）
    所有这一切之所以成为可能并且能够实现，是由于我们两国间的关系现在是在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上、在列宁——斯大林原则的基础上发展的。在这些原则的指导下，从资本主义奴役下解放出来的各国之间的全面合作已建立起来，并正在巩固中。这种合作是建立在承认大小国家权利平等，兄弟般的互助，并且在列宁——斯大林旗帜下为社会主义胜利而共同斗争的基础上的。（经久不息的大声鼓掌）
    大家都看见南斯拉夫的命运。这个国家已经被骗而落入一帮背叛本国人民卖身投靠美英帝国主义的间谍奸细手里去了。现在人人都看到，铁托——卡德尔——兰科维奇集团已在南斯拉夫恢复了资本主义秩序，剥夺了人民的全部革命成果，把南斯拉夫变为侵略的帝国主义国家的工具。这一帮窃取政权、唯利是图的罪犯知道南斯拉夫人民对他们深恶痛绝，直到今天都只能用血腥恐怖和法西斯统治手段来维持政权。但是这样是不能长久维持下去的。南斯拉夫人民一定会找到走向自由，消灭铁托法西斯政权的道路。（鼓掌）
    从这里可以看到，我们必须提防无产阶级国际主义的伪装起来的敌人，爱好自由的人民必须自始至终忠于列宁—斯大林的国际主义原则，保卫这个各国间兄弟般合作的基础。（经久不息的掌声）
    现在，当美英帝国主义国家集团采取公开准备新世界战争的政策，甚至公然采取侵略行动的时候，苏联和波兰的友谊和同盟对保卫和平有着巨大的意义。
    我们不能忽视，侵略的北大西洋联盟各国已走上放手扩充军备的道路，美国在欧洲和近东建立的军事基地越来越多。这使战争的威胁更加严重了。美英帝国主义者和他们的法国及其他附庸国一道，已开始重新把西德武装起来，并开始恢复日本的军国主义。他们匆忙地实施这些毫无希望的冒险计划，而不顾彰明昭著地违反国际协定。
    但是，这并不能掩盖在帝国主义阵营内，各个国家的内部矛盾已日趋尖锐，同时各国统治集团间的斗争也愈来愈激烈了。
    在这种情况之下，各国人民不仅必须保持警觉，而且还要尽可能提高警惕，以制止战争，保卫和平。只有这样，我们才能取得持久和平的可靠保障。
    近年来，和平国家的阵营已大大地壮大了。各人民民主国家以及中华人民共和国这样强大的新盟友正在与苏联一道，共同进行保卫和平的斗争。（长久的掌声）在资本主义国家，在西方和东方，和平运动都一天天在高涨。正是因为这个原故，苏联代表呼吁终止在朝鲜的敌对行动并实行停战的声音，才获得这样有力的反响。
    在这几年里，苏联和人民民主波兰间的友谊和同盟也日益加强了。伟大的斯大林所奠定的苏波友谊已成了苏波两国人民的兄弟联盟的基础（暴风雨般的掌声）。我们两国人民在共同的旗帜下前进，走向一个共同的目标。那些像曾被斯大林同志恰当地誉为十月英雄、同时又是波兰的伟大爱国者的捷尔仁斯基一样的为实现社会主义而斗争的历史中的工人阶级光荣的领袖们的梦想，现在是实现了。
    在这波兰人民新历史开始进入第八年的时候，苏联代表团热烈地祝贺正在建设社会主义社会保卫和平事业的人民民主波兰取得更多的成就。苏联与人民民主波兰间不可侵犯的友谊和兄弟同盟万岁！（历久不息的暴风雨般的欢呼。全体起立。全体听众长久地欢呼斯大林同志和贝鲁特同志）。波兰人民和他们的总统贝鲁特万岁！（全场起立，雷动的欢呼声历久不息）
