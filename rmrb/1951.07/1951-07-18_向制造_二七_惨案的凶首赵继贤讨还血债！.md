　　Demand Blood Debt from Zhao Jixian, the Chief Culprit of the "February 7th" Massacre!
    (Xinhua News Agency reporters Wan Nong, Wang Dejian, Liu Li)
    Zhao Jixian, the murderer who masterminded the "February 7th" Massacre and slaughtered a large number of railway workers, was executed on the 16th after a public trial at the Jiang'an Railway Station in Hankou—the very place where the executioners massacred the outstanding Communist Party member Lin Xiangqian and a large number of workers.
    Twenty-eight years ago, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese railway workers launched a heroic and epic struggle against imperialism and warlords to demand the right to organize trade unions and to fight for freedom, democracy, and human rights. On February 7, 1923, railway workers along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, from Changxindian in the north to Jiang'an Station in Hankou in the south, suffered a massive massacre by feudal warlords supported by imperialism. More than 40 people were killed, and hundreds were injured. The bandit Zhao Jixian was the main criminal who directly commanded the massacre.
    The bandit Zhao Jixian was a representative of China's feudal landlord warlords and a faithful lackey of imperialism. Twenty-eight years ago, during his tenure as the director of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau, the "Chief of the Military Law Office of the Governor's Office of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan" of the Northern Warlord reactionary government, and the "Chief of the Baoding Army Inspection Office," he murdered countless workers. He forbade workers from smoking or drinking water in the factory and forbade them from warming themselves by the fire in winter. He deducted workers' wages. During the Zhili-Fengtian War, wages were not paid for four months. He once embezzled more than ten million yuan in silver from the purchase of railway sleepers. He gave the 30 million yuan allocated for the construction of the Yellow River Iron Bridge to Wu Peifu as military expenses.
    On February 1, 1923, when the Beijing-Hankou Railway Workers' General Union was established, the bandit Zhao Jixian, on the one hand, pretended to allow the workers to hold a meeting and indicated that the weekly holiday on January 28 would be changed to February 1. On the other hand, Zhao Jixian secretly telegraphed Wu Peifu, demanding the severe suppression of the workers. The bandit Zhao also ordered the military police to forcibly disband the founding meeting of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Workers' General Union, seal off the meeting venue, destroy the plaques and couplets sent by worker delegations from various regions, send bandit troops to occupy the Zhengzhou General Union headquarters, destroy union equipment, and surround worker representatives. On February 7, under the command of the bandit Zhao, a bloody mass arrest and massacre of railway workers began. More than 40 workers were killed, and outstanding Communist Party members Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang heroically and unyieldingly sacrificed themselves under the enemy's knives. In addition, hundreds of people were injured, a large number of workers were imprisoned, and more than a thousand workers were fired.
    The blood debt owed by the bandit Zhao Jixian has never been forgotten by the workers. At that time, a ballad was popular on the Beijing-Hankou Railway: "Zhao Jixian is truly hateful, slaughtering our workers. Strive! Struggle! Everyone must be of one heart. If we don't avenge, if we don't wipe out the hatred, we are not worthy to be in this world." Today, the workers' long-cherished wish has been realized.
    In November 1949, when the Chinese Railway Workers' Union was officially established in Beijing, the veteran workers' representatives of the "February 7th" Massacre requested the government to punish the criminals of the "February 7th" Massacre. The veteran worker Liu Rong said: "Comrades, our old accounts have not yet been settled! Let's settle them. It has been more than twenty years. The enemies who created the 'February 7th' Massacre: the warlord Wu Peifu is already dead, the imperialist forces have been driven away, and only that executioner—the bastard director Zhao Jixian—is still alive. When will he be arrested so that we can vent our grievances!" The request of the veteran workers of the "February 7th" Massacre received warm support from the conference. Zhao Jixian, who started his career by slaughtering and exploiting workers, had been living a blood-sucking life since the "February 7th" Massacre, acquiring a large amount of land, houses, factories, companies, and commercial firms in Suzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin. In Tianjin alone, he owned industries such as Taiping Trading Company, Jufeng Weaving Factory, and Dongchang Hat Shop. After the downfall of the warlord Wu Peifu, the bandit Zhao became a big landlord and a big profiteer again. In 1944, he colluded with the Japanese invaders and opened Tongdao Rice Mill and Yongda Enterprise Company in Suzhou to serve the Japanese invaders. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he colluded with the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to continue to squeeze the blood and sweat of the people. For more than twenty years, under the protection of imperialism and the reactionary rulers of China, he remained at large.
    In the summer of 1949, after our People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, this blood-stained executioner became panicked. Especially in this year's large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the bandit Zhao felt that the people's net of justice was spread everywhere, and he could not find a "safe" place. He felt it was not "safe" to live in Suzhou, so he secretly fled to Shanghai; feeling it was still not "insured," he returned to Suzhou and changed "Zhao Jixian" to "Zhao Yisan," and then to "Zhao Boxue." But no matter how he changed his name and surname, he was finally exposed by the people. On May 10 this year, public security personnel from Suzhou arrested him at No. 34 Xijie Street, Changmen, Suzhou.
    The news of the bandit Zhao's capture immediately spread throughout the country. When the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government approved the handover of the bandit Zhao to the Beijing-Hankou Railway workers for a public trial, the workers cheered. Huang Dafa, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" Massacre in Zhengzhou, immediately cooperated with the public security personnel to escort the Zhao criminal from Suzhou. He said: "At that time, the bandit Zhao ordered us to be taken to Luoyang for trial. Today, we want to escort him to the workers for trial. We want to avenge the martyrs of the 'February 7th' Massacre!" Workers from various stations and the families of the martyrs held forums and accusation meetings. They elected representatives to form a delegation to participate in the public trial and memorial service in Jiang'an, Hankou. Chen Guizhen, the wife of the martyr Lin Xiangqian, who lived far away in Fuzhou, and Lin Xianglin, the martyr's younger brother, also rushed to participate to see with their own eyes the executioner who killed their relatives executed before the people. Mei Huiqing, the wife of the martyr Lin Caiyong, who was killed by the bandit Zhao, shaved her head and became a nun to avoid being humiliated by the bandits after her husband's death, and she has been doing this for twenty-eight years. But the day she had been looking forward to finally arrived, and she came specifically to participate in the public trial. At the public trial, she took off her robes, put on her work clothes, and prepared to join the trade union.
    Early in the morning of July 16, although it was raining heavily, people still gathered in groups at the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot Square. Twenty-eight years ago, near this venue, on Fujian Street, Henan Street, and Jiang'an Station, the martyrs shed their blood for the happiness of the working class. Today, this place has become the venue for the public trial of criminals.
    At the public trial, the families of the martyrs and veteran workers of the "February 7th" Massacre poured out their grievances accumulated over twenty-eight years. The veteran worker Zhang Shihan was interrogated and severely tortured by the bandit Zhao. Zhang Shihan stepped forward and accused: "Zhao Jixian, you have this day too! Is your reactionary force greater, or the people's force greater? You have been completely defeated, and we are forever victorious." The veteran worker Lu Zhixing, who had one of his legs cut off by the bandit Zhao, took the stage and excitedly demanded a blood debt from the bandit Zhao. Chen Guizhen, the wife of the martyr Lin Xiangqian, Mei Huiqing, a family member of a martyr, and Wu Yanrong, all made accusations, demanding that the government shoot Zhao Jixian to avenge their relatives.
    Representatives from all walks of life and the families of the martyrs held a public memorial service at Jiang'an Station with extremely heavy hearts. The bandit Zhao was executed in front of the spirits of the martyrs.

　　向制造“二七”惨案的凶首赵继贤讨还血债！
    （新华社记者万农、汪德鉴、刘立）
    制造“二七”惨案，大批屠杀铁路工人的凶手赵继贤，十六日在汉口江岸车站——也就是当年刽子手们屠杀优秀的共产党员林祥谦及大批工人的所在地——公审后伏法了。
    二十八年前，中国铁路工人在中国共产党领导下，为了要求组织工会，争取自由、民主、人权，向帝国主义和军阀进行了英勇壮烈的斗争。一九二三年二月七日，京汉铁路的工人北自长辛店、南至汉口江岸车站，遭受了帝国主义所支持的封建军阀的大屠杀，被难者有四十多人，受伤达数百人。赵匪继贤，就是当时直接指挥大屠杀的主要凶犯。
    赵匪继贤是中国封建大地主军阀的代表与帝国主义的忠实走狗。二十八年前，当他任京汉铁路局局长、北洋军阀反动政府“直鲁豫巡阅使署军法处处长”、“保定陆军稽查处处长”期内，不知杀害了多少工人。他不准工人在厂内吸烟喝水，冬天不准工人烤火。他克扣工人的工资。奉直战时，曾有四个月不发工资。他曾一次就贪污了买枕木的现洋一千多万元。他把修建黄河大铁桥的工程费三千万，送给吴佩孚作军费。
    一九二三年二月一日，当京汉铁路工人成立总工会时，赵匪一方面假意允许工人开会，并表示一月二十八日的星期例假改在二月一日，另一方面，赵匪却在暗地里致电吴佩孚，要求严厉镇压工人。赵匪并命令军警强迫解散京汉铁路总工会的成立大会，封闭会场，捣毁各地工人代表团送来的匾额对联，派匪军占领郑州总工会会所，捣毁工会设备，包围工人代表。二月七日，在赵匪的指挥下，开始了对铁路工人血腥的大逮捕、大屠杀。工友四十余人罹难，优秀的共产党员林祥谦、施洋在敌人屠刀下英勇不屈、壮烈牺牲。此外，还有数百人受伤，大批工人被关进监牢，一千多工人被开除。
    赵匪继贤欠下的血债，工人们一刻也没有忘记。当时在京汉铁路上曾流行着这样的一首歌谣：“赵继贤，真可恨，残杀我工人。努力呀！奋斗呀！大家要齐心。不报仇，不雪恨，不为世上人。”今天，工人们的宿愿实现了。
    一九四九年十一月，中国铁路工会在北京正式成立的时候，“二七”老工人代表在大会上请求政府惩办“二七”惨案的凶犯。老工人柳荣说：“同志们，我们的老账还没有算完哪！算一算吧，二十几年了，制造‘二七’惨案的仇人：军阀吴佩孚已经死了，帝国主义势力已经被赶跑，独有那个刽子手——兔崽子局长赵继贤还活着，什么时候逮捕了他，才能出尽我们的冤气呀！”“二七”老工人的请求，得到大会的热烈支持。靠屠杀和剥削工人起家的赵匪继贤，在“二七”后一直过着吸血的生活，在苏州、北京、天津置下了大量的田地、房屋和工厂、公司、行庄。仅天津一地，即有太平贸易公司、聚丰织布厂和东昌帽庄等产业。军阀吴佩孚倒台后，赵匪便又成了大地主和大奸商。一九四四年他和日寇勾结，在苏州开设通道米厂、永大企业公司，为日寇服务。日寇投降后，又与美蒋匪帮勾结，继续压榨人民的血汗。二十几年来，在帝国主义与中国反动统治者的庇护下，一直逍遥法外。
    一九四九年夏天，我人民解放军渡江后，这个血债累累的刽子手就慌乱起来了，特别是在今年大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动中，赵匪更感觉四处都张开了人民的法网，找不到一个“安稳”地方。住在苏州觉得不“安全”，偷偷逃到上海；感觉还不“保险”，又回到苏州，并把“赵继贤”改成“赵益三”，又改成“赵博学”。但是不管怎样改名换姓，终于被人民检举了出来。今年五月十日，苏州市公安人员便在苏州阊门西街三十四号逮捕了他。
    赵匪被捕获的消息，立即传遍了全国各地。当中央人民政府公安部批准将赵匪交给京汉铁路工人进行公审时，工人们都欢呼起来。郑州“二七”老工人黄大发，立即协同公安人员到苏州押解赵犯。他说：“当时赵匪下令要把我们拿到洛阳去审判，今天我们要把他押到工人面前受审，我们要替‘二七’烈士们报仇！”各站工人与烈士家属，纷纷举行座谈会与控诉会。他们推举了代表，组成代表团到汉口江岸参加公审和公祭大会。远居福州的烈士家属林祥谦的夫人陈桂贞和烈士的弟弟林祥麟也赶来参加，要亲眼看着这个杀害他们亲人的刽子手在人民面前伏法。被赵匪杀害的烈士林材咏的妻子梅慧清，自她丈夫死后，为了避免匪徒们对她的污辱，就削发为尼，至今已二十八年。但她所盼望的一天终于来到了，她特地赶来参加公审。她在公审会上脱下法衣，穿起工作服，准备参加工会工作。
    七月十六日一大早，天虽然下着密密的细雨，人们仍然成群结队地汇集在江岸机务段广场上。二十八年前，就在这会场附近的福建街、河南街及江岸车站，先烈们为了工人阶级的幸福，流尽了自己的鲜血。今天，这里变成了公审凶犯的会场。
    在公审会上，烈士家属和“二七”老工人，倾吐了他们压积二十八年来的苦水。老工人张士汉曾受到赵匪审问与严刑拷打。张士汉走上前去控诉说：“赵继贤，你也有今天呀！到底是你们的反动力量大，还是人民的力量大？你们是彻底打败了，我们是永远的胜利了。”老工人吕志兴，当时曾被赵匪砍掉了一只腿，现在他上台激奋地向赵匪讨还血债。烈士林祥谦的夫人陈桂贞、烈士家属梅慧清及吴艳荣等都进行了控诉，要求政府枪毙赵继贤，为自己的亲人报仇。
    各界代表与烈士家属以极其沉痛的心情，在江岸车站举行了公祭。赵匪就在烈士们的灵前伏法。
