　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 5th (via TASS): The Korean Central News Agency published a statement by Kim Chang-joon, Secretary-General of the Central Standing Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland United Front. The statement said: The Democratic Fatherland United Front, which unites 71 democratic parties and people's organizations across Korea, has repeatedly stated the necessity of unifying the motherland peacefully and promoting freedom and democratic development. This is an expression of the will of all the Korean people and an enthusiastic endorsement of the peaceful policies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea government. The response of the American aggressors and the Lee Seung-man group to the consistent efforts of the entire Korean people to unify the motherland peacefully was the armed aggression of June 25, 1950. They trampled the will of the Korean people to unify the motherland under their feet, attempting to turn Korea into an American colony and a military springboard, but they were greatly mistaken. All the Korean people have risen up to defend the motherland and safeguard their glory, freedom, and independence. Agreeing to a ceasefire and armistice demonstrates that all the people yearn for peace and long for an end to armed intervention in Korea; at the same time, it also proves the consistent peace-loving policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea government. The Korean people believe that negotiations on a ceasefire and armistice in Korea, as well as the cessation of American armed intervention in Korea, will create conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and the establishment of peace in the Far East, and will help eliminate the danger of another world war.

　　朝祖国战线书记局局长金昌俊
    对停战谈判问题发表声明
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社平壤五日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社发表朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央常务委员会书记局局长金昌俊的声明。声明说：联合了朝鲜全国七十一个民主党派与人民团体的祖国统一民主主义战线，曾一再声明有必要以和平的方式统一祖国并促进自由与民主发展。这是朝鲜全体人民的意志的表现，并且是对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和平政策的热烈拥护。对于朝鲜全体人民以和平方式统一祖国的一贯努力，美国侵略者与李承晚集团的答复却是一九五○年六月二十五日的武装侵略。它们把朝鲜人民统一祖国的意志践踏在脚下，企图把朝鲜变成美国的殖民地和军事跳板，但是，他们是大错而特错了。朝鲜的全体人民都起来保卫祖国，维护他们的光荣、自由与独立。同意停火与休战，表明了全体人民都渴望和平，都渴望停止对朝鲜的武装干涉；同时，也证明朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一贯的爱好和平的政策。朝鲜人民认为，关于在朝鲜停火与休战的谈判以及停止美国在朝鲜的武装干涉，将为和平解决朝鲜问题以及在远东建立和平创造条件，并将有助于消除另一次世界大战的危险。
