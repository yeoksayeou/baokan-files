Northeast Military and Civilians Warmly Welcome "August 1st"
Xinhua News Agency: Beijing People Decide on Various Methods to Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Revolutionary Martyrs
　　Military and civilians in Northeast China are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day.
　　Cadres at all levels of the Northeast Military Region are studying Commander-in-Chief Zhu's "How the Chinese People Defeated the Armed Chiang Kai-shek Reactionary Faction of American Imperialism" and Xiao Hua's "The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army." Soldiers are universally studying the brief history of the army's founding and the current situation. Before "August 1st," all units will extensively organize propaganda teams to publicize the history of the People's Liberation Army's founding and the heroic and exemplary deeds of the People's Liberation Army to the masses where they are stationed. Each unit will also use methods such as visiting model workers and peasants and holding visits and discussions to collect the patriotic model deeds shown by people from all walks of life in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to educate the troops. On the morning of "August 1st," each unit will hold a celebration meeting by regiment; in the afternoon, various military and sports activities will be held. The direct organs of the Northeast Military Region will hold a cadre meeting on the evening of "August 1st."
　　People in various parts of Northeast China have also begun preparing various commemorative activities. Each district in Shenyang is holding an enlarged meeting of the People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee to summarize the preferential treatment work in the past six months, and will establish mass-based committees for preferential treatment work; at the same time, a forum will be held for family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of military personnel, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and family members of volunteers going to Korea, to report to them on the preferential treatment work and solicit their opinions. The Songjiang Province and Harbin City branches of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association have successively issued notices for a general inspection of preferential treatment work, and stipulated that propaganda on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers should be widely carried out among cadres and the masses to cultivate a social atmosphere of people loving the People's Liberation Army and respecting families of martyrs and soldiers. In addition, inspections of preferential treatment and substitute farming work are being widely carried out in rural areas. For example, Taian County in Heilongjiang Province organized a work group of more than 1,400 people to inspect preferential treatment work from house to house. (Xinhua News Agency)
　　The people of Beijing love their own troops, and a wave of support for the army and preferential treatment for families of soldiers and martyrs has been set off on the eve of "August 1st."
　　Seven workers in the Dachengho Flour Mill in Xibanqiao came up with a good way to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs: they grind more grain every day, without charging processing or transportation fees, and sell it to the forty families of martyrs and soldiers in this police station at cost. After obtaining the consent of the capitalists, they formulated a "Preferential Purchase Grain Certificate," and each family of martyrs and soldiers was issued one, allowing them to purchase grain with the certificate. In order to persist for a long time, they added the following clause to their patriotic pact: "Help families of martyrs and soldiers solve difficulties, and sell grain at cost with preferential treatment." Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs by doing a good job in substitute farming. The He Zhentang mutual aid group in Hegezhuang Village in the western suburbs, in addition to guaranteeing that the land of Liu Shuying, a military dependent, will not be left uncultivated, will also ensure deep plowing and fine cultivation, and spread two carts, or 1,600 catties, of green fertilizer after hanging up the hoe. Business and industry circles have also automatically formulated methods for giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers: all cinemas in the city will show a free early show once a month, starting in July, to entertain families of martyrs and soldiers until the end of the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Industries such as hairdressing, oil and salt, and pharmacies in the third, fourth, and seventh districts have also set out methods such as 95% or 80% discounts to give preferential treatment to families of martyrs and soldiers.
　　Other citizens also carry out preferential treatment work according to their own conditions. Deng Shiying, the women's committee member of the tenth police station in the third district, rents out a house and does not ask the military dependent to pay more rent when the rent increases. Yang Guirong, a woman from the sixteenth police station, provides free childbirth and cooking services for poor military dependents. The mutual aid group of Wang Shuzhen in Hegezhuang in the suburbs guarantees that Tian Jiheng, an elderly martyr's family member, always has water to drink at home.
　　In the work of preferential treatment, doctors are not lagging behind. Chinese and Western medicine doctors in the third district jointly agreed: families of martyrs and soldiers are exempt from registration fees for medical treatment, charged for medicine at cost, and after seeing families of martyrs and soldiers, they will visit them at home if they have time. Zhang Dehua Clinic in Guang'anmen in the eighth district has already asked the police station to forward fifty free consultation coupons to families of martyrs and soldiers.

　　东北军民热烈迎接“八一”
　  北京人民定出各种办法优待烈军属 
    东北各地军民热烈筹备庆祝“八一”建军节。
    东北军区各级干部正在学习朱总司令所作的《中国人民怎样击败了美帝国主义武装的蒋介石反动派》和萧华所作的《中国共产党与中国人民解放军》等论文。战士们普遍进行建军简史和目前形势的学习。各部在“八一”前均广泛组织宣传小组，向驻地群众宣传人民解放军的建军史和解放军的英雄模范事迹。各部并采用访问工农劳动模范和参观、座谈等方式，搜集各界人民在抗美援朝运动中所表现出来的爱国模范事迹以教育部队。“八一”上午，各部将以团为单位举行庆祝会；下午举行各种军事、体育活动。东北军区直属机关将于“八一”晚间召开干部会。
    东北各地人民亦已开始筹备各项纪念活动。沈阳市各区正召开各界人民代表会议协商委员会扩大会议，总结半年来的优抚工作，并将成立群众性的优属工作委员会；同时还将召开革命烈士家属、军人家属及革命残废军人、志愿赴朝民工家属座谈会，向他们报告优抚工作情况及征求他们的意见。松江省和哈尔滨市抗美援朝分会已先后发出普遍检查优抚工作的通知，并规定在干部和群众中广泛进行拥军优属工作的宣传，养成人民热爱解放军、尊敬烈属、军属的社会风气。此外，在农村中正广泛进行优抚、代耕工作的检查。如黑龙江省泰安县就组织了一千四百多人的工作组，挨户检查优抚工作。（新华社）
    北京市各界人民挚爱自己的队伍，“八一”前夕掀起拥军优属热潮。
    西板桥大成磨坊里七位工友，想出个拥军优属好办法：每天多磨些粮食，不收加工费和运费，按成本卖给本派出所的四十个烈属、军属。他们征得资方同意后，便制订了一种“优属购粮证”，烈属、军属每户发一张，凭证购粮。又为了长期坚持，他们在爱国公约上添了这样的一条：“帮助烈军属解决困难，照成本优待售粮”。北京郊区农民以作好代耕工作来拥军优属。西郊何各庄村何振堂互助组，除保证使军属刘淑英的地不荒一分外，还要做到深耕细作，挂锄后沤绿肥两车一千六百斤。工商界也自动制订优待烈属、军属的办法：全市各电影院自七月份起，每家每月义务放映一次早场，招待烈属、军属，直至抗美援朝结束为止。三区、四区、七区理发、油盐、药铺等行业，也都订出九五扣或八扣等优待烈属、军属的办法。
    其他市民也根据自身条件来进行优抚工作。三区第十派出所的妇女委员邓世英出租房子，房租涨价时也不要军属多交房租。十六派出所妇女杨贵荣免费替贫苦军属接生、做饭。郊区何各庄汪淑珍的互助组保证老年烈属田计恒家经常有水吃。
    在优抚工作中，医生们也不后人，三区的中西医生共同商定：烈属、军属看病免收门诊费，按成本收药费，替烈属、军属看病后，有时间还要上门探问。八区广安门内张德华诊疗所已把五十张免费门诊券请派出所转送给烈属、军属。
