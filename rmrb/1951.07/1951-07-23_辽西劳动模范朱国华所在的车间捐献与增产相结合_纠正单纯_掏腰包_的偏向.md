Liaoxi Model Worker Zhu Guohua's Workshop Combines Donation with Increased Production
　　Correcting the Tendency to Merely "Open Wallets"
　　The workshop where Liaoxi model worker Zhu Guohua works, in the donation movement, corrected the tendency of purely "opening wallets" without combining it with increased production. It put forward practical ways to improve production and formulated a new plan for increasing production and donation, making the patriotic donation movement develop enthusiastically.
　　At the beginning of the donation movement, some trade union cadres in Zhu Guohua's workshop, relying only on momentary enthusiasm and without carefully studying donation methods, called on everyone to voluntarily donate. Within ten minutes, the 31 employees in the entire workshop donated more than 5 million yuan in total. A few days later, everyone heard that donations should be made from increased production, so they mistakenly thought that "they were going to open their wallets again," and everyone was not very active. Some people agreed to increase production, but felt that they lacked methods, and were hesitant. Therefore, the movement for increasing production and donation in the workshop was slow to start.
　　After the factory leaders discovered the above situation, they quickly convened a meeting of workshop cadres and activists to discuss in detail the various instructions and documents related to the donation movement. They also asked the workshop director Zhu Guohua to report on the existing problems in current production, so that the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres in the entire workshop clearly understood the significance of combining the donation movement with increased production. Everyone then unanimously proposed: Only by thoroughly examining the various unreasonable phenomena existing in production, proposing improvement methods, and realistically formulating a patriotic donation plan, can we do a good job in donation on the basis of increasing production.
　　After this meeting, trade union cadres went deep into each group to understand the production situation, and further mobilized workers to put forward rationalization proposals. Party members and propagandists in the groups also used the gaps in their work to hold current affairs discussion meetings, discuss current affairs, so that every employee recognized the importance of strengthening national defense to stop aggression and safeguard peace. Therefore, the enthusiasm of all employees in the workshop for increasing production greatly increased, and fourteen important rationalization proposals were put forward within a few days. Among them, only the modification of the bottom of the hydrogen generator furnace can increase output by 42 percent; improving the technical management of the entire workshop can also save one-fifth of the manpower. The employees also put forward many effective methods so that some long-standing shortcomings in the workshop's work could be corrected.
　　After the workshop trade union assisted the administrative side in studying the employees' suggestions in detail, a feasible six-month production increase plan was drafted. Each group discussed this plan and then formulated a group production increase plan, and used this as the central content of the group's patriotic pledge. According to the production increase plan, in the second half of this year, in addition to completing the original production tasks, the workshop can also increase production and save wealth equivalent to 57 tons of grain. Therefore, the workshop formulated a six-month donation plan based on this: (1) Donate 50 percent of the bonus from increased production. (2) Except in special circumstances, each group guarantees a 100 percent monthly attendance rate, and donates all of this bonus (approximately equal to one day's salary per person). After this production increase and donation plan was announced, all employees were full of confidence, and put forward individual guarantees to achieve the plan, setting off an enthusiastic production increase competition.

　　辽西劳动模范朱国华所在的车间捐献与增产相结合
　  纠正单纯“掏腰包”的偏向
    辽西劳动模范朱国华所在的车间，在捐献运动中纠正了不和增加生产相结合单纯“掏腰包”的偏向，提出了切实改进生产的办法，制订了新的增产捐献计划，使爱国捐献运动热烈展开。
    在捐献运动开始时，朱国华车间的有些工会干部只凭一时热情，没有很好研究捐献的办法，就号召大家自动认捐，在十数分钟内，全车间的三十一名职工一共认捐了五十多万元。几天之后，大家又听到要从增产中进行捐献，于是就误会为“又要掏腰包了”，大家很不积极；有的虽然同意增产，但感到缺少办法，也是踌躇不前。因此，该车间的增产捐献运动迟迟不能开展。
    该厂领导干部发现了上述情况后，便迅速召开了车间的干部和积极分子会议，详细讨论了有关捐献运动的各项指示和文件，又请车间主任朱国华报告了当前生产中所存在的问题，使全车间党、政、工、团的干部明确地认识了捐献运动和增产相结合的意义。大家随即一致提出：只有深入检查在生产中现存的各种不合理现象，提出改进办法，切实订好爱国捐献计划，才能在增加生产的基础上做好捐献工作。
    这次会议结束后，工会干部深入各小组了解生产情况，进一步发动工人开展合理化建议。小组中的党员和宣传员也利用工作的间隙，召开了时事漫谈会，讨论了时事，使每个职工都认识了加强国防力量对于制止侵略、保卫和平的重要性。因此，全车间职工的增产热情大为高涨，数天内就提出了各种重要的合理化建议十四件：其中仅改装氢气发生炉的炉底一项，即可增加产量百分之四十二；健全全车间的技术管理一项，亦可节省人力五分之一。职工们还提出了许多有效办法，使该车间过去长期存在着的某些工作上的缺点，都能得到纠正。
    车间工会协助行政方面详细地研究了职工们的建议后，便拟订了切实可行的半年增产计划。各小组讨论了这个计划，又订出小组增产计划，并作为小组爱国公约的中心内容。根据增产计划，今年下半年该车间除完成原定的生产任务外，尚可多增产与节约价值等于五十七吨粮食的财富。于是，该车间就据此制订了半年的捐献计划：（一）捐献增产所得的奖金百分之五十。（二）各小组除特殊情况外，每月出勤率保证百分之百，将此项奖金全部捐献（约等于每人一天的工资）。这一增产捐献计划公布后，全体职工都信心百倍，纷纷提出个人保证实现计划的条件，掀起了热烈的增产竞赛。
