To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, esteemed comrades:

　　On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany extends to you brotherly fighting greetings.

　　The thirty-year history of your party is filled with arduous and sacrificial struggles against the imperialist aggressors and their bloody running dogs in China. The Chinese Communists, who have always fought at the forefront of the Chinese people, have created countless heroic achievements under the brave and visionary leadership of Mao Zedong in order to win China's unity, independence, democracy, and peace. You have won victory because you have always followed the path indicated by Lenin and adhered to the wise teachings of the great Stalin in your struggle. This victory has formed a turning point in Asian history. After smashing the chains of imperialism and eliminating the rule of monopoly capitalists and their corrupt Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and relying on close friendship with the Soviet Union, are now advancing from victory to victory on the road of national economic construction and cultural construction, eliminating all feudal remnants, and transforming China from a backward agricultural country into a modern industrial country.

　　Close friendship unites our people with your people, and our party—the vanguard of the German working class—with your party. In the thirty-year history of your party, you have given the German workers a great education. Your selfless spirit of sacrifice, your unlimited loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and your purposeful and arduous work in the construction of your motherland are a brilliant example to us.

　　Today, all peace-loving and progressive forces in the German people are watching with fighting concern the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people against the aggression of American imperialism in Korea. The heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers teaches all peace-loving people that the forces of peace—when they actively struggle—are stronger than the imperialist robbers.

　　At the same time, American and British imperialism are preparing a new war against the Soviet Union in Europe, and are thus attempting to turn West Germany into the most important war base. American imperialism is also attempting to rearm West Germany, just as it is rearming Japan in the Far East. Therefore, in Germany, in the struggle to maintain peace and strive for unity and independence, we face the same enemy who also threatens your freedom and independence. Therefore, the friendship between the German and Chinese people in the great world peace movement is of the utmost importance in stopping American wars and ensuring peace.

　　We congratulate you, the glorious Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, on achieving further successes in building a strong and prosperous China. China is a very important part of the great world peace camp, and she is faithfully united with the Soviet Union under the leadership of the great Stalin.

　　Long live the close friendship between the Chinese and German people!

　　Long live the common struggle of the world peace camp against the war policy of American imperialism and for peace!

　　Glory and honor to the Communist Party of China, which led the Chinese working people to victory!

　　Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, our friend!
                                 The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
                                               Wilhelm Pieck
                                                 Walter Ulbricht
                             Berlin, June 28, 1951

### 德国统一社会党贺电

　　德国统一社会党贺电中国共产党中央委员会敬爱的同志们：
    值此中国共产党成立三十周年之际，德国统一社会党中央委员会向你们致以兄弟的战斗敬礼。
    贵党的三十年历史充满了反对帝国主义侵略者及其在中国的血腥走狗的艰巨和牺牲重大的斗争。始终战斗在中国人民最前列的中国共产党人，在毛泽东勇敢和富有远见的领导下，为了争取中国的统一和独立、民主与和平，创立了无数英雄业迹。你们赢得了胜利，因为你们在斗争中始终遵循着列宁所指示的道路，并且遵守着伟大的斯大林英明的教导。这一胜利，形成了亚洲历史的转折点。中国人民在粉碎了帝国主义的锁链并消灭了独占资本家及其腐败的蒋介石集团的统治之后，现在在共产党的领导下，依靠着与苏联紧密的友谊，正在国家经济建设和文化建设的道路上从胜利迈向胜利，正在消灭一切封建残余，并且正在把中国从一个落后的农业国家转变成为一个现代化的工业国家。
    紧密的友谊将我国人民与贵国人民，我党——德国工人阶级的先锋队——与贵党团结在一起。在贵党的三十年历史中，你们给予德国工人很大的教育。你们忘我的牺牲精神，你们对革命事业的无限忠诚，你们在祖国建设中目标明确的、艰苦的工作，对我们是一个辉煌的榜样。
    今天，德国人民中一切爱好和平的进步力量都在以战斗的关怀注视着中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民共同反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的英勇斗争。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争教导着一切爱好和平的人民：和平力量——当其积极斗争的时候——比帝国主义强盗来得强大。
    美、英帝国主义同时在欧洲准备反对苏联的新战争，因而企图将西德变成最主要的战争基地。美帝国主义同样企图重新武装西德，正像它在远东重新武装日本一样。因此我们在德国，在维护和平、争取统一和独立的斗争中，存在着同时也威胁你们自由和独立的同一敌人。所以，德国人民和中国人民在伟大的世界和平运动中的友谊，对制止美国战争和确保和平有着最重大的意义。
    我们祝贺你们，光荣的中国共产党和中国人民，在建设一个富强、繁荣的中国中，获得进一步的成就。中国是伟大的世界的和平阵营中的一个极重要的部分，她与伟大的斯大林领导下的苏联忠诚地团结在一起。
    中德人民亲密的友谊万岁！
    世界和平阵营反对美帝国主义战争政策和争取和平的共同斗争万岁！
    光荣和荣耀归于领导了中国劳动人民走向胜利的中国共产党！
    中国共产党和中国人民的领袖，我们的朋友——毛泽东万岁！
                                 德国统一社会党中央委员会
                                               威廉·皮克
                                                 格罗提渥
                             一九五一年六月二十八日于柏林
