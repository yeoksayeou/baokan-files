Dedicatory Message from Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. On behalf of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, I would like to extend warm congratulations and the most lofty respect to the great Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, its organizations at all levels, and all its members!
    Over the past thirty years, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and has achieved unprecedented accomplishments, establishing a new nation of the Chinese people that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous – the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, through the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, it has expanded and consolidated the people's democratic united front, universally enhanced the people's awareness, and inspired their patriotic enthusiasm, greatly solidifying the people's democratic dictatorship. This has not only provided a strong guarantee for the final victory of the Chinese revolution but has also set up a glorious banner for the liberation movements of people in all colonial and semi-colonial countries around the world. It has not only created an incomparably happy and infinitely bright future for the Chinese people but has also become a strong pillar for all peace-loving people worldwide in opposing aggression and striving for lasting peace. The Communist Party of China has not only correctly grasped the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, but also, in the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, the great Chairman Mao has ingeniously developed and expanded Marxism-Leninism, creating the great Mao Zedong Thought as a guide for the victorious struggle of all colonial and semi-colonial peoples.
    However, as Chairman Mao said, our current achievements are only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. The construction of New China is still a long-term process. The aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan, still invading our neighboring country of Korea, threatening the security of our motherland, and threatening peace in Asia and the world. Under the wise leadership of the great and glorious Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we, the Chinese people, will undoubtedly work even harder, continue to achieve even greater victories on the basis of victory, thoroughly eliminate all reactionary forces, and bravely march forward on the road of new democracy, socialism, and communism! Since its establishment, the China Association for Promoting Democracy has always been under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party of China and is a close comrade-in-arms of the Communist Party of China. In the future, we will definitely learn more from the Communist Party of China, develop and consolidate our organization, continue to strive for unity and progress, and always follow the Communist Party of China! Always follow Chairman Mao!
    Long live the great Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

Dedicatory Message from Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. It is a great honor for me to represent the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party at this meeting to pay our highest respects to the Communist Party of China and its wise and great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. It is unimaginable that without the Communist Party of China headed by Mao Zedong, the three enemies of the Chinese people could have been so quickly and thoroughly defeated. The thirty-year history of the Communist Party of China is a history of the great victory of Marxism-Leninism in China, a history of the Chinese working class leading the broad masses of peasants and other democratic forces in a heroic struggle against the imperialists and their running dogs, finally overthrowing their reactionary rule, establishing a People's Republic based on the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants, and advancing towards socialism. This thirty-year history is inseparable from the great and glorious name of Comrade Mao Zedong. We want to cheer: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!
    The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is a political party that arose because the reactionary group of Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution. Only by accepting the leadership of the Communist Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan could it embark on the road to the victory of the Chinese people today. The history of the new People's China is one of moving towards a socialist future, towards a communist future, and requires the entire Chinese people to unite even further under the banner of the Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao. On behalf of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, I solemnly declare at the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China: The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party expresses its heartfelt support for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, submits to their leadership, and thanks them for the many help and guidance they have given to our party and comrades in the course of the Chinese revolution. At the same time, I want to solemnly make a guarantee: The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party will not only follow the Communist Party of China forever in the face of the overall historical task of uniting all democratic classes in China, overthrowing the common enemy of the people, and building a People's China, but also wage resolute struggles in the current three major specific political tasks – resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We must also closely follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism. We will turn these guarantees into the actual actions of all comrades to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. I shout:
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the Chinese working class!
    Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong!

Dedicatory Message from Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society
    Today, as we celebrate the glorious 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, I express my infinite joy and gratitude in paying tribute to the Communist Party of China and to the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao!
    The thirty years from the birth of the Communist Party of China to the present have been years of unprecedented turmoil and greatness in Chinese history. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people finally defeated imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, finally destroyed their reactionary rule, and established a People's Republic based on the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are united and engaged in the great construction of new democracy and continue to wage resolute struggles against imperialism and the remaining counter-revolutionary forces at home.
    The reason why the Chinese people can exert such tremendous power and achieve such brilliant victories is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. To be precise, the victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This victory not only liberated China from the depths of disaster and oppression but also saved thousands upon thousands of Chinese people; even the broad masses of intellectuals, under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, have found the correct path of struggle.
    The great leader Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the most faithful guide of the Chinese working class but also the great savior of all the Chinese people, especially the Chinese intellectuals. He is an outstanding thinker of Marxism-Leninism. Since accepting the influence of the Communist Party and Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of Chinese intellectuals have begun to know how to use the proletarian worldview as a tool for observing the fate of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Today, as we celebrate the glorious day of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, in addition to enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao and the great victory of the Chinese people, we must also respond to Chairman Mao's call, launch criticism and self-criticism, strive to learn from the Communist Party of China, study the theory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially to earnestly study the working methods of the Communist Party of China, learning its resolute struggle, selfless dedication, loyalty, honesty, humility, prudence, and its good at serving the masses of the people style, to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, combine with the workers and peasants, serve the workers and peasants, to sincerely support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and strive to expand the people's democratic united front. Consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, unite the broad masses of cultural, educational, and scientific workers around the Communist Party of China, and strive to thoroughly defeat imperialism, eliminate all remaining counter-revolutionary forces, consolidate the victory of the people's democratic revolution, and build an independent, autonomous, prosperous, and happy New China! Finally, we shout:
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

Dedicatory Message from Lin Kengsheng, Director of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
    In the midst of the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the high tide of the three major movements, we welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. On behalf of all members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, I extend the most lofty revolutionary salute and warm congratulations to the great leading party!
    Over the past thirty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its outstanding leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have united to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism combined with Chinese feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism; they have established an independent people's democratic state, transforming the poor, backward, oppressed, and invaded old China into a new China that is independent, democratic, free, unified, increasingly strong, and increasingly prosperous.
    The victorious Chinese people have truly understood from the revolutionary experience of the past thirty years and their own daily life experience the truth that "there would be no New China without the Communist Party of China." Therefore, they warmly support and sincerely accept its leadership and are enthusiastically carrying out the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform. The results of these movements will inevitably lay a foundation as solid as Mount Tai for our country, open up a broad road for national industrialization, bring a happy life to the people, and add tremendous strength to opposing imperialism and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people's happy life and bright future should be attributed to Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Communist Party of China. We should thank Chairman Mao and thank the Communist Party of China!
    But while we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China with incomparable excitement, and while we are singing the greatness and glory of Chairman Mao and the leading party with infinite pleasure, more than six million people in Taiwan are still living in extreme pain under the brutal rule of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. However, they have not stopped fighting under the enemy's bloody butcher knife. On the contrary, under the call of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and with the enthusiastic encouragement of the people of the whole country, they are waging heroic and extraordinary struggles against the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. The people of Taiwan know that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China are the great saviors and are convinced that the Chinese people, united under the great banner of Mao Zedong, can completely liberate Taiwan; and they will certainly liberate Taiwan. Therefore, they are constantly looking forward to the motherland; looking forward to Chairman Mao; looking forward to the Communist Party of China to liberate Taiwan.
    In order to defeat U.S. imperialist aggression as soon as possible, liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, and build a peaceful and happy New China, let us unite even more closely around the Communist Party of China and move forward forever!
    Finally, on behalf of all members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and all the people of Taiwan, I shout:
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live!

Dedicatory Message from Yan Xichun, Member of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party
Chairman and Comrades:
    On behalf of the China Zhi Gong Party, I extend the warmest congratulations to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and congratulate our leadership party, the Communist Party of China, on the 30th anniversary of its founding.
    The thirty-year history of the birth and development of the Communist Party of China is the entire process of the Chinese people's revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party beginning to find the road to new democracy and achieving unprecedented great victories; that is to say, the history of the Communist Party of China is the history of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China.
    Due to the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people defeated the most powerful imperialism – the most ferocious running dog of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and turned the great nation of 500 million people from a weak country ruled by feudalism for thousands of years, ruled by imperialism for more than 100 years, and enslaved and despised by others into a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and strong. It successfully completed the cause that all pioneers of the Chinese people's revolution since the 1840s had not been able to achieve.
    This great and glorious history of struggle of the Communist Party is something that every Chinese person should be proud of and should learn from.
    Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is not reconciled to its failure in China and is still harming us with all kinds of despicable actions. The aggression against Korea and Taiwan are ironclad proofs of this action.
    We must resolutely repel imperialist aggression under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must intensify our study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and loyally follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Final victory is certain to be ours.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!
    Long live the great and glorious Communist Party of China!

Dedicatory Message from Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the New Democratic Youth League
    Today, all the youth of China and the 4 million members of the New Democratic Youth League are celebrating the 30th birthday of the great Communist Party of China with great excitement and joy. All the youth of China have clearly seen that under the long-term reactionary and dark rule in the past, the lives of the people and the youth were truly miserable. Since China had the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the dawn of hope has appeared in the sky of China. The youth, together with the adults, under the guidance of the truth of the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism, and under the call of Chairman Mao, after a long period of arduous and heroic struggle, finally enabled the Chinese people to win the greatest victory in history; our lives have since been full of joy and hope. In the past, if we were unwilling to be slaves and running dogs, we would be slaughtered and imprisoned; now we are truly the masters of the country. In the past, we were often threatened by unemployment, lack of education, and hunger; now our lives are not only guaranteed but will also be improved day by day with the advancement of economic construction. In the past, we were deprived of any freedom of thought, speech, and organization; now we can freely study the truth and have our own youth organizations and groups. In the past, we felt that the long night was boundless, and we did not know where the suffering of the motherland and the people would end; now, infinite light is beckoning to our younger generation. All these great transformations, this great victory, would never have been possible without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    The Communist Party of China not only brought a life full of light and happiness to the Chinese youth but also, since its birth, has always given great concern to the lives and struggles of the Chinese youth. It is the encourager, organizer, and leader of the Chinese youth. It educates the youth with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, calling on the youth to be warriors of truth, to fight for the beautiful future of China, the world, and themselves, and to fight for the great ideal of the complete liberation of mankind. The Communist Party of China not only represents the interests of the Chinese people and the youth most correctly, so it has won the most enthusiastic and sincere support of the youth. Not only that, but the Communist Party of China also unites, educates, and leads the entire generation of youth through the youth's own organizations, especially the organization of advanced youth (now the Chinese New Democratic Youth League). Under the Communist Party's incomparably cordial care, leadership, and help, the Chinese youth, together with the people, have continuously gained extremely great victories in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, in the struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, and in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.
    Thirty years of great historical events have made the Chinese youth clearly realize that in order to move towards a great future, to make the greatest contribution to the country and the people, and to become true patriots, they must resolutely support the Communist Party of China, must always follow the Communist Party, follow Chairman Mao, must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and must resolutely implement the Communist Party's policies and resolutions. We must always be the Communist Party's loyal assistants and reserve force.
    Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!
    Long live the leader of the Chinese people and the mentor of the youth, Chairman Mao!

Dedicatory Message from Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth
Comrades:
    Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, I extend the most sublime and warmest regards to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China.
    In the old society, Chinese youth were constantly poisoned and ravaged by the reactionary ruling class; they were often threatened by unemployment, lack of education, and hunger. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang consistently treated youth with police, prisons, inhuman torture, abuse, and murder.
    But on the other hand, from the first day of the birth of the Communist Party of China, for thirty years, Chinese youth have always received the care and love of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China educated the youth with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, enabling us to recognize the truth and love the truth; enabling us to deeply realize that we must persist in fighting against the three major enemies who have long oppressed the Chinese people – imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism – and that this struggle will inevitably be victorious. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, Chinese youth have bravely stood at the forefront of the struggle in every domestic revolutionary war, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, playing a huge role and making brilliant contributions to the revolutionary cause. Since the Communist Party of China led the people of the whole country to liberate the mainland of the country, Chinese youth have been loved by the Communist Party and the people of the whole country everywhere. Chinese youth are working and studying enthusiastically in factories, rural areas, troops, schools, and various organs and departments; striving to train themselves as useful talents for building a new China. Chinese youth, after the long-term education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and their own personal experience, recognize that our new China of independence, freedom, and prosperity today, and the happiness of our youth today, are the results of the struggle of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China leading the people of the whole country, sacrificing the lives of countless revolutionary martyrs, and walking through many tortuous and arduous roads. It is on the basis of this understanding that Chinese youth love the motherland, love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, throwing themselves into the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, volunteering to go to the war front, participating in military cadre schools, participating in various construction works, studying hard, and actively assisting the people's government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries and carrying out land reform and other work.
    The history of the Chinese revolution for thirty years proves that Chinese youth can only exert their wisdom and strength in the Chinese revolution and strive for their own beautiful future under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. In the future, the youth of our country must resolutely follow Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party of China, and create more brilliant achievements in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and building a new China, together with the people of the whole country, to add glory to the motherland and glory to Chairman Mao!
    Long live the great Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great mentor of Chinese youth, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

Dedicatory Message from Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    Because of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and because of the leadership of the leader of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have stood up in the world, and Chinese women have been liberated from feudalism. Everyone has sung: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." We must also sing: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no women's liberation!"
    He led the Chinese people to liberate themselves from the semi-colonial and enslaved life under the oppression of imperialism for a hundred years, from the invasion of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and from the occupation and poisoning of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and thoroughly turned themselves over.
    He led women to turn themselves over from the feudal shackles of thousands of years; from the military, political, cultural, economic, and production aspects, he gave women the opportunity to serve; from the division of land and the implementation of the Marriage Law, he ensured women's independence, freedom, and complete liberation.
    This is the truth that the Communist Party has handed over to us to learn and practice, and it is the necessary path that the Communist Party has taught all the Chinese people to take from new democracy to socialism.
    With a glorious and great experience, after countless difficulties and hardships, we have finally overcome all obstacles and moved towards the light. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the party of the Chinese working class, we feel proud, have something to rely on, have something to follow, and deserve to celebrate. We are no longer afraid of imperialist aggression, we must persist in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, strengthen the democratic camp of peace-loving countries in the world, and that is an invincible force. We will no longer allow the existence of counter-revolutionary elements, we must implement the work of strictly preventing bandits and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and unite all progressive forces, that is the method of eliminating enemies and consolidating cooperation. Land reform is to uproot feudalism, and we must work harder to support it and participate in the work. In addition, we must do our job well in our respective positions and accept the leadership of the Communist Party with loyalty and honesty.
    We are willing to sincerely support the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, because under this leadership, China and the Chinese people, including women, have stood up in the world, and Chinese women have also turned over greatly. Let us shout:
    Long live the great Communist Party of China!
    Long live the great leader of the Communist Party of China, who leads the Chinese people to glory and prosperity, Chairman Mao!

Dedicatory Message from Shen Yanbing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Today, all the Chinese people are rejoicing and celebrating the glorious anniversary of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, which led the people to complete the revolution. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the national associations, I would like to express my highest respect and warmest sincere congratulations to our great leader Chairman Mao, to the Communist Party of China, and to all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteer Army.
    Under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China worked hard and led the Chinese people to overthrow the reactionary regime of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and established a revolutionary regime of people's democratic dictatorship based on the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants. The history of ancient China has since unfolded a brilliant and splendid page. In less than two years, the construction of the country has made rapid progress, unprecedented. In the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China is a great force for safeguarding world peace. All this cannot but be attributed to the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. This is what all the people of the country, including literary and art workers, unanimously and sincerely thank!
    We literary and art workers are deeply honored to be able to serve the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, to the best of our ability. The literary and art workers of the whole country, together with the people of the whole country, are standing on their own posts, under the highest guiding principle of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, and actively participating in the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. We have done the work of internationalism and patriotism propaganda and education, and at the same time we have educated ourselves.
    Today, as we welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we literary and art workers want to take this opportunity to solemnly express to the people of the whole country: the literary and art workers of the whole country must unite more closely under Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, unite around the Communist Party, and intensify their study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, intensify their study of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, improve themselves, transform themselves, and implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and putting popularization first. We must use various forms of literature and art to carry out education in patriotism and internationalism, that is: to reflect the glorious and great history of our motherland, the great and outstanding struggles and brilliant creations of the masses of the people, the brilliant and outstanding and extremely heroic achievements of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteer Army, and the brilliant achievements of the workers and peasants in production and construction. We must use literature and art as a weapon to eliminate feudal ideas and comprador consciousness, support new democracy, support the Common Program, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, support the democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, oppose the violent aggression of U.S. imperialism, resolutely defend the country, and defend world peace.
    We literary and art workers take it as a supreme honor to be able to shoulder such a task. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have the confidence and ability to shoulder this task!
    Comrades in the literary and art circles, let us use more and better practical work to celebrate the glorious anniversary of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, to express our highest respect for the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao.
    Long live the great unity of literary and art workers in the whole country!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Dedicatory Message from Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Scientific and Technological Societies
    Today, as the people of China jubilantly welcome the thirtieth birthday of the Communist Party of China, we, the scientific workers of the whole country, are very honored to have the opportunity, like other people, to stand in the ranks of the revolution to participate in this grand celebration, which gives us a new understanding from infinite excitement.
    First of all, let us estimate the time from the historical perspective: In China, which has a record of more than 3,000 years of highly developed culture, thirty years is not too long; in the process of the gradual development of capitalism, the formation of imperialism, and the collapse of today, this process of more than 300 years, thirty years cannot be regarded as too long; since the issuance of the most solemn and historical document, the Communist Manifesto, until today, in the history of more than 100 years of the world proletarian revolutionary struggle, thirty years is less than one-third of the time.
    However, we must remember that the significance of history does not lie in recording the length of time of a certain era, but in pointing out the content of that particular era. In these thirty years, especially in the recent three years of these thirty years, what position has the history of our China occupied in the entire world history? The feudal society of more than 3,000 years has been defeated; for more than 100 years, imperialism, which has run rampant in China, and all the evil forces colluding with it, have been basically eliminated; the Kuomintang reactionary regime headed by Chiang Kai-shek has been overthrown. Nearly a quarter of the people in the world have walked out of the dark world and into the bright road.
    Such unprecedented great undertakings have been completed in this short time. Therefore, it is even more evident that our liberation movement is great.
    However, greatness is only one aspect of the view. On the other hand, what must be emphasized in evaluating historical traces from a historical perspective is the precision and correctness of this movement. Only by being precise can it be correct: seeking correct understanding in extremely complex relationships and in constant changes. After thirty years of struggle, the Communist Party of China has very clearly expressed how consciously it has achieved this requirement in order to complete arduous undertakings. Why have the Chinese people demanded revolution since the Revolution of 1911, reaching several climaxes, but ultimately failing? Why do we have today only under the leadership of Chairman Mao? The answer seems to be very ordinary – Chairman Mao used Marxism-Leninism – it was only after Chairman Mao comprehensively led the revolution that he combined Marxism-Leninism with China's reality and gradually and deeply understood how to experience dialectical materialism from practical work and life, thereby learning to use dialectical materialism to guide work and life. Because of this, the quality of the worker-peasant revolutionary masses that were mobilized was greatly different, and its quantity rapidly formed a mighty force.
    In the next series of struggles, it is even more necessary to master Marxism-Leninism, especially to understand natural dialectics. For example, in the revolutionary struggle, we must have the courage to correct the biases and errors in our work. We frankly admit that in the past our scientific work had been biased towards empty academic theory, allowing people to tumble in a vacuum; since liberation, we have paid a huge price and gained some experiences that were not unpredictable. From those precious, but unfortunate experiences, we have realized: "Without correct engineering design, construction is impossible." Further, we can say, no, we must say: Without in-depth scientific research, all specially difficult, creative engineering designs cannot be correct. We are convinced that studying Chairman Mao's thought and Marxism-Leninism is the most effective way to reduce these errors, reduce or correct these biases. After learning, it is sometimes worth asking yourself, how much of what we understand is still book dogma, and how much has become part of our work and thinking?
    As a member of the Chinese scientific workers standing under the banner of Chairman Mao, today, taking this opportunity to express gratitude and sublime respect to the Communist Party of China, which is leading the Chinese people to march towards a bright future, I contribute this idea, asking comrades in scientific work outside the party, and also asking Communist Party members who are responsible for cadre work in business institutions, to better combine our work more closely in the future and serve the people better.
    Long live the Chinese people!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Dedicatory Message from Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization
    In the past thirty years since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has led the Chinese people in carrying out the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and has now achieved a great victory.
    Science and technology, which were severely restricted and ravaged in the old society, have also been liberated with the liberation of the people of the whole country. Today, we scientific workers have the confidence to strive to make science and technology serve the country's construction cause, and we also have the enthusiasm to carry out the enlightenment movement of the laboring people's scientific knowledge.
    We know that if there had been no founding of the Communist Party of China thirty years ago, if there had been no heroic struggle of the Chinese Communists in the past thirty years, if there had been no correct leadership of the party leader Chairman Mao, there would have been no victory of the Chinese revolution today, the Chinese people would not have the current good life and the future socialist happy and prosperous future, there would have been no broad road for scientific development, so the Chinese laboring people would not have had the opportunity to master modern science and technology to serve production and national defense construction.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, our All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization must unite more patriotic scientific workers under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao to serve the people, and strive to popularize scientific knowledge to meet the growing cultural and scientific requirements of the laboring people in our country after liberation.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, all members of our All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, to disseminate production technology knowledge with correct views, to publicize the great achievements of our country's new democratic production construction and the scientific creations and inventions of our people, and to introduce the achievements of the advanced science and technology of the socialist country of the Soviet Union, in order to cultivate a new patriotic spirit and a materialistic worldview among the people, and to resolutely fight against superstition, backwardness, and all reactionary ideas that violate science.
    Long live the glorious and great Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    民主促进会主席马叙伦献词
    今天是中国共产党建党三十周年纪念日，我代表中国民主促进会，谨向伟大的毛主席和中国共产党，各级组织及全体党员致热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意！
    三十年来中国共产党领导着中国人民进行反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的斗争，已经获得了史无前例的成就，建立了中国人民自己的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新国家——中华人民共和国，并且在抗美援朝、土地改革、和镇压反革命三大运动中，扩大和巩固了人民民主统一战线，普遍地提高了人民的觉悟和鼓舞了人民的爱国热情，极大地巩固了人民民主专政的政权，不但为中国革命的最后胜利提供了有力的保证，而且为全世界殖民地半殖民地国家人民的翻身运动，树立一面光辉的旗帜，不但为中国人民创造了无比幸福无限光明的前途，而且成为全世界爱好和平人民反对侵略争取持久和平的坚强的柱石。中国共产党不但正确地掌握了马克思、列宁主义的普遍真理，而且在中国革命的具体实践中，伟大的毛主席天才地发展和光大了马克思列宁主义，创造了伟大的毛泽东思想，作为一切殖民地半殖民地人民解放斗争胜利的指南。
    但是，诚如毛主席所说，我们现在的成就还只是万里长征走完了第一步，新中国的建设事业还是一个长期的过程，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，还在霸占着我们的台湾，还在侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，威胁着我们祖国的安全，威胁着全亚洲和全世界的和平，我们中国人民在伟大的、光荣的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导之下，无疑的还要加倍努力，在胜利的基础上继续不断取得更伟大的胜利，彻底消灭一切反动势力，向着新民主主义、社会主义、共产主义的大道奋勇迈进！中国民主促进会从成立时起，就一直受着中国共产党的领导和帮助，与中国共产党是亲密的战友，今后一定更多地向中国共产党学习，发展和巩固我们的组织，继续争取团结、进步，永远跟着中国共产党走！永远跟着毛主席走！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
            农工民主党中央监察委员会主席彭泽民献词
    今天是中国共产党的三十周年纪念日，我代表中国农工民主党在大会上向中国共产党和英明伟大的领袖——毛泽东主席致崇高的敬礼，是十分荣幸的。中国如果没有以毛泽东为首的中国共产党，中国人民的三个敌人，能如此迅速地彻底地被打倒，是不可想像的。中国共产党的三十年历史，是马克思列宁主义在中国得到伟大胜利历史，是中国工人阶级领导着广大的农民和其他的民主力量，向帝国主义者及其走狗作英勇斗争，终于推翻了他们的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民共和国，并进而走向社会主义的历史，而这三十年的历史是与毛泽东同志这一个伟大而辉煌的名字分不开的，我们要欢呼：中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
    中国农工民主党是由于蒋介石反动集团背叛革命而产生的一个政党，在抗战时接受了共产党的领导，才能够走向今日中国人民的胜利道路。新的人民的中国的历史是走向社会主义前途，走向共产主义前途的，需要全中国人民更进一步地团结在中国共产党和伟大的毛主席的旗帜之下的，我代表中国农工民主党在庆祝中国共产党三十周年纪念的大会上郑重的表示：中国农工民主党对中国共产党和毛主席表示衷心的拥护，服从领导，并且感谢他们在中国革命过程中，对我们的党和同志给了许许多多的帮助和指导，同时我又要郑重提出保证：中国农工民主党不仅要在中国各民主阶级联合起来，打倒人民的共同敌人，建设人民的中国这一总的历史任务前面，永远地跟着中国共产党走，不仅要在当前的三大具体政治任务——抗美援朝，土地改革，镇压反革命中，作坚决地斗争，还要紧紧跟着共产党走上社会主义的道路，我们要把这些保证，变成全体的同志实际行动来祝贺中国共产党三十周年。我高呼
    中国共产党万岁
    中国工人阶级万岁
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁
            九三学社主席许德珩献词
    今天，我们在这里庆祝中国共产党三十周年的光荣诞辰，我怀着无限欢欣和感激的心情向中国共产党致敬，向伟大的人民领袖毛主席致敬！
    中国共产党从诞生到现在的三十年间，在中国历史上正是空前动荡和伟大的年代。由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，中国人民终于战胜了帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义，终于摧毁了他们的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民共和国。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，中国人民正团结一致，从事新民主主义的伟大建设，并继续向帝国主义和国内残余的反革命势力，作坚决的斗争。
    中国人民所以能发挥如此巨大力量获得如此辉煌的胜利，这是和中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导分不开的。确切的说，中国人民的胜利，是马克思列宁主义理论的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。这个胜利不但使灾难深重的中国从层层的压迫之下解放出来，更拯救了千千万万的中国人民；就是广大的知识分子，在毛泽东思想的光芒照耀之下，也找到了正确的奋斗的道路。
    伟大的领袖毛泽东主席不但是中国工人阶级最忠实的引路人，而且是全中国人民，特别是中国知识分子的大救星。他是马克思列宁主义的杰出的思想家。中国广大的知识分子，自从接受了共产党和毛泽东思想的薰陶以后，才开始知道用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。今天，我们庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年的光荣日子，我们除了为中国共产党和毛主席的伟大胜利，为中国人民的伟大胜利而热烈欢呼之外，更要响应毛主席的号召，展开批评与自我批评，要努力向中国共产党学习，学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东思想，尤其是要认真学习中国共产党的工作方法，学习它坚决奋斗，大公无私，忠诚老实，谦虚谨慎，善于为人民群众服务的作风，要遵照毛主席的指示，和工农结合，为工农服务，要竭诚拥护中国共产党的领导，努力扩大人民民主统一战线。巩固人民民主专政，要团结广大的文教科学工作者在中国共产党的周围，为彻底打倒帝国主义，肃清一切残余的反革命势力，巩固人民民主革命的胜利果实，建设独立、自主、富强、康乐的新中国而奋斗！最后我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
            台湾民主自治同盟理事林铿生献词
    在中朝人民的伟大胜利中，在三大运动的高潮中迎接中国共产党建党三十周年纪念日，我代表台湾民主自治同盟全体盟员，向伟大的领导党致崇高的革命敬礼！和热烈的贺意！
    三十年来中国人民在中国共产党及其杰出的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下团结起来推翻了帝国主义和中国的封建主义、官僚资本主义相结合的反动统治；建立了独立的人民民主国家，把穷困、落后、被压迫、被侵略的旧中国，变为独立、民主、自由、统一、日益强盛、日益繁荣的新中国。
    胜利了的中国人民从中国三十年来的革命经验以及自己日常生活体验中切实领会到：没有中国共产党就没有新中国这一真理，因而热烈拥护并诚恳接受其领导，正在轰轰烈烈的进行着抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革的三大运动。而这些运动之结果，必然地将给我们的国家奠定稳如泰山的基础，将给国家工业化开辟一条广阔的道路，将给人民带来幸福的生活，将在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平中增加巨大力量。中国人民如此幸福的生活和光明的前途，应该归功于毛主席归功于中国共产党的领导。我们应该感谢毛主席感谢中国共产党！
    但是当我们以无比兴奋的心情庆祝中国共产党三十周年的时候，当我们以无限愉快的心情歌颂着毛主席和领导党的伟大和光荣的时候，六百多万台湾人民却仍在美蒋匪帮的残暴统治下过着水深火热极端痛苦的生活。可是他们在敌人血腥的屠刀下并没有停止战斗，相反的正在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的感召下，在全国人民热情的鼓舞下，向美蒋反动派进行着英勇卓绝的斗争。台湾人民知道毛主席、中国共产党是大救星，并确信在伟大毛泽东旗帜下团结起来的中国人民，完全可以解放台湾；并且必定解放台湾。因此时时刻刻在盼望着祖国；盼望着毛主席；盼望着中国共产党去解放台湾。
    为了早日击败美帝国主义侵略，早日解放台湾，建设和平康乐的新中国，让我们更紧密的团结在中国共产党的周围永远前进！
    最后我代表台盟全体盟员、全体台湾人民高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
        致公党中央委员会委员严希纯献词主席及各位同志：
    我代表中国致公党向毛主席，中国共产党致最热烈的祝贺，祝贺我们大家的领导党，中国共产党，建党三十周年纪念。
    中国共产党的诞生和发展的三十年历史，即是三十年来中国人民革命在共产党的领导之下开始找到新民主主义的大道并获得空前伟大胜利的全部过程；也即是说，中国共产党的历史就是中华人民共和国的建国历史。没有共产党就没有新中国。
    由于共产党的领导，中国人民打败了最强大的帝国主义——美国所扶持的最凶顽的走狗蒋介石匪帮，把五万万人民的伟大国家从一个被封建主义统治了数千年，被帝国主义统治了一百多年，被人奴役被人贱视的弱国变为一个独立、自由、民主、统一而且强大的新中国。它成功地完成了从十九世纪四十年以来一切中国人民革命的先驱者没有能够得到胜利的事业。
    共产党这种伟大光荣的奋斗史，是我们每一个中国人民所应当骄傲的，也是我们应当学习的。
    帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，不甘心于它们在中国的失败，还在以一切卑劣行动来危害我们。侵略朝鲜和台湾就是这种行动的铁证。
    我们一定要在共产党领导下坚决打退帝国主义的侵略。我们一定要加紧学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想并忠诚地跟着毛主席和共产党走。最后胜利一定是我们的。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    伟大光荣的中国共产党万岁！
            新民主主义青年团书记冯文彬献词
    今天，全中国的青年和四百万新民主主义青年团的团员们，都以极兴奋、极愉快的心情来庆祝伟大的中国共产党成立三十年的生日。全中国的青年都已经清楚地看到，在过去长期的反动的、黑暗的统治之下，人民和青年的生活，真是悲惨极了，而自从中国有了共产党，有了毛主席，中国的天空就露出了曙光和希望；青年们和成年人在一起，在共产党的、马克思列宁主义的真理指引之下，在毛主席的号召之下，经过了长期艰苦的英勇斗争，终于使得中国人民获得了历史上最伟大的胜利；我们的生活从此充满了欢乐，充满了希望。过去，我们如果不愿意当奴才走狗，就要被屠杀监禁；现在我们真正作了国家的主人翁。过去我们经常处在失业失学和饥饿的威胁之下；现在我们的生活不仅有了保障，并且将随着经济建设的前进而日益改善。过去，我们被剥夺了任何思想言论和组织的自由权利；现在我们可以自由地研讨真理，并有了青年自己的组织和团体。过去，我们感到长夜茫茫，不知道祖国和人民的苦难何处才是尽头，现在，无限的光明在向我们青年一代招手。这一切伟大的转变，这一个伟大的胜利，离开了共产党、毛主席，是决不可能的。
    中国共产党，不只给中国青年带来了充满光明幸福的生活，而且从它诞生以来，始终对中国青年的生活和斗争，给了极大的关心。它是中国青年的鼓舞者，组织者和领导者。它以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想来教育青年，号召青年做真理的战士，为中国的、世界的、和自身的美好将来而斗争，为人类的彻底解放的伟大理想而斗争。中国共产党既是最正确地代表了中国人民和青年的利益，所以它就得到青年最热烈和真诚的拥护。不只这样，中国共产党还通过青年自己的组织，特别是青年先进分子的组织（现在就是中国新民主主义青年团），来团结、教育和领导整个青年的一代。在共产党无比亲切的关心和领导、帮助之下，中国青年就和人民在一起，不断地在反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中，在推翻蒋介石反动统治和抗美援朝的斗争中，获得极伟大的胜利。
    三十年的伟大历史事变，使得中国青年清楚地认识到，要使自己走向伟大的前程，能够对国家、人民作最大的贡献，成为真正的爱国者，必须坚决拥护中国共产党，必须永远跟着共产党、跟着毛主席前进，必须努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，必须坚决执行共产党的政策和决议。我们要永远地作共产党的忠实的助手和后备军。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民领袖和青年导师毛主席万岁！
            全国民主青联总会副主席钱三强献词同志们：
    今天是中国共产党成立三十周年纪念日，我谨代表中华全国民主青年联合总会向毛主席和中国共产党致最崇高、最热烈的敬礼。
    在旧社会里，中国青年不断地遭受到反动统治阶级的毒害和摧残；经常被失业、失学、饥饿所威胁；国民党反动统治的时期，蒋介石匪帮一贯地以警察、监牢、惨无人道的酷刑、虐杀等来对待青年。
    但是另方面，从中国共产党诞生的第一日起，三十年来，中国青年就一直得到毛主席和中国共产党的关怀和爱护。中国共产党以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想教育青年，使得我们认识真理、热爱真理；使得我们深刻认识到对于长期压迫在中国人民头上的三大敌人——帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义——，必须坚持和他们斗争，这个斗争必然获得胜利。中国青年在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，在第一次国内革命战争、第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争、第三次国内革命战争中，每一次都英勇地站在斗争的最前列，发挥了巨大的作用，对革命事业作了光辉的贡献。自从中国共产党领导全国人民解放了全国大陆后，中国青年更是到处受到共产党和全国人民的爱护。中国青年正在工厂、农村、部队、学校及各种机关部门中，热烈地工作和学习着；努力锻炼自己作为建设新中国的有用人材。中国青年经过了毛主席及中国共产党长期的教育，和自己亲身的体验，认识到我们今天独立、自由、富强的新中国和今天我们青年的幸福，是毛主席及中国共产党领导全国人民、牺牲了无数革命先烈的生命、走过了许多曲折艰苦的道路而斗争得来的成果。中国青年正是在这样的认识基础上，热爱着祖国，热爱着毛主席和中国共产党，热烈地响应毛主席和中国共产党的号召，投身到抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，纷纷志愿到战争前线，参加军事干部学校，参加各种建设工作，努力学习，并且积极协助人民政府镇压反革命，和进行土地改革等工作。
    三十年来中国革命的历史证明了：中国青年只有在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，才能在中国革命中发挥他们的智慧和力量，也才能争取到自己的美好前途。今后，我们全国青年一定坚决跟着毛主席，跟着中国共产党走，在抗美援朝及建设新中国的各项工作中，和全国人民一道，创造出更辉煌的成绩，为祖国增光、为毛主席增光！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国青年的伟大导师，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
            全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平献词
    由于中国共产党的领导，由于共产党领袖毛主席的领导，使中国人民在世界上站立起来了，使中国妇女在封建下解放出来了。大家歌颂过：“没有共产党，就没有新中国。”我们更要歌颂：“没有共产党，就没有妇女解放！”
    他领导着中国人民，从百年来帝国主义压迫的半殖民地奴役生活下、在八年抗日战争的侵略下、从美蒋匪帮的侵占、毒害下，解放出来，彻底地翻了身。
    他领导妇女，从几千年的封建枷锁下翻了身；从军事、政治、文化、经济和生产各方面给妇女以服务的机会；从划分土地以及婚姻法等的实施，以确保妇女的独立自由和彻底解放。
    这是共产党交给我们去学习和实践的真理，是共产党教给我们全中国人民从新民主主义走向社会主义的必经道路。
    具有光荣而伟大的经历，经过无数的艰难困苦，终于克服了一切障碍，步向光明前进的中国工人阶级的党，在毛主席领导之下，我们感到骄傲，有所依靠，得到遵循，值得庆贺。我们再不惧怕帝国主义的侵凌，把抗美援朝运动坚持下去，加强世界爱好和平的民主阵营，就是不可战胜的力量。我们再不容许反革命分子的存留，把严防匪特镇压反革命的工作贯彻下去，把一切进步的力量团结起来，就是消灭敌人巩固合作的方法。土地改革是把封建从根拔起，我们更要加倍努力去拥护，去参加工作。此外各在本岗位上做好工作，来忠诚老实地接受共产党的领导。
    我们愿以至诚拥护中国共产党和毛主席的领导，就因为由于中国和中国人民连妇女在内在这领导之下，中国人民在世界上站起来了，中国妇女也大翻身了。让我们高呼：
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党的英明领导者、把中国人民引向光荣、强盛的毛主席万岁！
            全国文联副主席沈雁冰献词
    今天全中国人民欢欣鼓舞，庆祝着领导人民完成革命的中国共产党建党的三十周年这一光荣的纪念日。本人代表全国文联和全国各协，谨向我们的伟大领袖毛主席，向中国共产党，向人民解放军和人民志愿军的全体指挥员战斗员，表示最崇高的敬意和最热烈的由衷的庆贺。
    中国共产党在毛主席的英明正确领导之下，艰苦奋斗，领导中国人民打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动政权，建立了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的革命政权。古老的中国的历史，从此展开了辉煌灿烂的一页。不到两年的工夫，国家的建设，突飞猛进，史无前例。在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营中，我中华人民共和国是保卫世界和平的一支伟大的力量，这一切，都不能不归功于中国共产党以及毛主席的英明正确的领导，这是全国人民，包括全国的文艺工作者在内，一致地衷心感谢的！
    我们文艺工作者，深以能在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，尽其所能，为人民服务，引为无上的光荣。全国的文艺工作者和全国人民一起，站在自己的本岗位上，在毛主席的文艺方针最高指导原则之下，踊跃地参加了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动。我们做了国际主义和爱国主义的宣传教育工作，同时也教育了自己。
    今天我们迎接中国共产党建党三十周年纪念日，我们文艺工作者要借这机会向全国人民郑重表示：全国的文艺工作者在毛主席的文艺方针之下要更紧密地团结起来，团结在共产党的周围，要加紧学习马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想，加紧学习毛主席的文艺方针，提高自己，改造自己，贯彻为工农兵服务、普及第一的方针。我们要运用文艺的各种形式，来进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育，这就是：反映我祖国的光荣和伟大的历史，人民群众的伟大卓绝的斗争和光辉灿烂的创造，人民解放军和人民志愿军的辉煌卓绝、英勇无比的战绩，工农群众在生产建设方面所获得的辉煌成就，我们要运用文艺这武器肃清封建思想、买办意识，拥护新民主主义，拥护共同纲领，巩固人民民主专政，拥护以苏联为首的民主和平阵营，反对美帝国主义的狂暴侵略，坚决保家卫国，保卫世界和平。
    我们文艺工作者以能担负这样的任务，引为无上的光荣。在共产党和毛主席领导之下，我们有信心，能够担负起这任务来的！
    文学艺术界的同志们，让我们用更多更好的实际工作来庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年的光荣纪念日，来表示我们对于中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的最崇高的敬意。
    全中国文学艺术工作者大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
            全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光献词
    在全中国人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接中国共产党第三十年的生日的今天，我们全国的科学工作者，很光荣地和其他的人民一样，得到机会，站在革命的队伍中，来参加这一隆重的庆祝大会，使我们从无限的兴奋中又得到一点新的认识。
    首先，让我们就历史来估计一下时间：在我们有了高度文化的纪录在三千年以上的中国，三十年不算太长；在资本主义逐渐发展，形成了帝国主义，走到了今日崩溃的阶段，这三百多年的过程中，三十年也不能算太久；在自从一个最庄严，最富有历史性的文件，《共产党宣言》发布以后，直到今天这一百多年来，世界无产阶级革命斗争的历史中，三十年还不到三分之一的时间。
    不过我们要记着：历史的意义，不在乎纪录某一个时代时间的长短；而在指出某一个特殊时代它的内容。在这三十年中，尤其在这三十年的最近三年中，我们中国的历史，在全部世界史中，占了什么样的地位？三千多年的封建社会，已经打垮了；一百多年来，在中国肆行无忌的帝国主义以及和它勾结的一切恶势力，已经基本地铲除了；以蒋匪介石为首的国民党反动政权被推翻了。差不多全世界四分之一的人民，从黑暗的世界中，已经走进了光明的路上了。
    这样一些空前伟大的事业，就在这很短的时间完成。因此，更见得我们解放运动的伟大。
    然而伟大只是一方面的看法。另一方面我们用历史的眼光来估价历史的陈迹所必须强调的，是这一运动的精密性和正确性。唯其能精密，所以才能正确：在极端复杂的关系中，在不断的变化中，求得正确的认识。经过三十年的奋斗，中国共产党就极明确地表示了如何自觉地达到了这种要求，才完成艰巨的事业。为什么自从辛亥以来，中国人民要求革命，几次达到高潮，而终归失败？为什么在毛主席领导下，我们才有今日？答案似乎是很平常的——毛主席运用了马克思列宁主义——是到毛主席全面地领导革命以后，才把马列主义与中国的实际结合起来，逐步深入地了解如何从实际工作中、生活上来体会辩证唯物主义，从而学习善于用辩证唯物主义来做工作和生活的指导。由于这样发动了的工农革命群众，它的质便大大的不同了，它的量也就迅速地形成了浩浩荡荡的队伍。
    在下一系列的斗争中，更需要掌握马列主义，尤其要了解自然辩证。如在革命的斗争中，我们更要拿出勇气，纠正工作上的偏向和错误。我们很坦白地承认：在过去我们的科学工作，曾经发生过空讲学理的偏向，让人们在真空中翻筋斗；自从解放以后，我们又付了巨大的代价，得到一些不是不能预期的经验。从那些宝贵的，然而倒楣的经验，我们已经认清了：“没有正确的工程设计，就不可能施工。”进一步，也可以说，不，必须说：没有深刻的科学研究，一切特殊困难的，具有创造性的工程设计，就不可能是正确的，我们确信学习毛主席的思想和马列主义，是减少这些错误，减小或者纠正这些偏向最有效的途径。学习了以后，有时候值得自己问一问，我们所了解的那些，究竟有多少仍然是属于书本上的教条，有多少已经形成了我们工作和思想的一部分？
    作为站在毛主席旗帜下的中国科学工作者的分子，今天借这个向领导中国人民向光辉灿烂的前景迈进的中国共产党，表示感谢和崇高的敬意的机会，我贡献这一点意思，要求党外科学工作的同志们，也要求在业务机构担负干部工作的共产党员同志们，今后把我们的工作，更能密切地结合起来，更好地为人民服务。
    中国人民万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
            全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希献词
    中国共产党建党三十年来，领导中国人民进行反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的革命，到现在已经取得了伟大的胜利。
    在旧社会里受到严重的限制和摧残的科学技术，也随着全国人民的解放而解放了。我们科学工作者，今天有了信心去努力使科学技术服务于国家的建设事业，也有了热情去开展劳动人民的科学知识启蒙运动。
    我们知道，如果没有三十年前中国共产党的成立，如果没有三十年来中国共产党人的英勇奋斗，如果没有党的领袖毛主席的正确领导，便不会有今天中国革命的胜利，中国人民便不会有目前的美好生活和未来的社会主义康乐富强的前途，便不可能有科学发展的宽广道路，从而中国的劳动人民便不可能有机会掌握近代科学技术，来为生产和国防建设服务。
    在庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年之际，我们中华全国科学技术普及协会一定要在党和毛主席的领导之下团结更多爱国的科学工作者为人民服务，努力普及科学知识，以满足解放后我国劳动人民对于文化和科学的日益增长的要求。
    在庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年之际，我们中华全国科学技术普及协会的全体会员一定要在党和毛主席领导之下努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，以正确的观点传播生产技术知识，宣传我国新民主主义生产建设的伟大成就和我国人民的科学创造与发明，并介绍社会主义国家苏联先进的科学技术的成就，借以在人民中间培养新爱国主义精神及唯物主义世界观，向迷信、落后和一切违反科学的反动思想作坚决地斗争。
    光荣的、伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
