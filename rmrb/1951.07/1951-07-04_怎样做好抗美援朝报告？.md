　　How to Give a Good Report on Resisting America and Aiding Korea?
　　Volunteer Army Returning Representatives Chai Chuanruo, Dong Lefu, Dou Shaoyi
　　The General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea: The experiences summarized in this article are very good and are recommended for reference by all work groups of returning Volunteer Army representatives and all work groups of the visiting delegation to Korea.
　　We three started giving reports in East China on March 3rd. We worked for two months and five days, giving a total of 153 reports to a direct audience of 2,416,100 people. After leaving East China on May 8th, we went through Jiujiang, Shangrao, and other places to Wuhan on the 17th, giving a total of 43 reports in the Central South region to an audience of 840,000. In the past three months, we have given a total of 196 reports to a direct audience of 3,256,100 people. We broadcasted on the radio eight times, reaching an estimated audience of over 7 million people. More than one million people lined the streets to welcome and see us off.
　　During this period of work, we had some experiences, which we have now compiled for relevant parties to use as reference.
　　First, we deeply realized that the broad masses of people urgently need to know the situation of the Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield. It is no accident that we received such a warm welcome from the people when we gave reports in various places. At the same time, this also shows that the propaganda methods determined by the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and the propaganda points prescribed for us are completely correct. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the political awareness of the people across the country has greatly increased, and there is widespread love and respect for the Volunteer Army. However, before seeing the representatives of the Volunteer Army and hearing their reports, although they were talking about resisting America and aiding Korea every day, they always felt that Korea was far away from them, and their understanding of the great significance of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was still at an abstract level. After seeing the representatives of the Volunteer Army and hearing their reports, they immediately changed. They felt that Korea was right in front of them, and that even the slightest effort they made in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was directly striking at the American aggressors. People further recognized the justice of the Korean people's war of liberation and the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, strengthened their confidence in victory, and recognized the arduousness of the Korean War, understanding that the people's support is the decisive factor in winning the war, and determined to fully support the front lines. It is precisely because our reports played the above-mentioned important role that the responsible comrades in various places attached great importance to our work, providing various conveniences, and many places consciously combined our reports with their central work, hoping that our reports could promote the local central work.
　　Second, when giving reports to the masses, it is necessary to differentiate between the objects and have different focuses. Our reports mainly consist of the following three parts: the justice of the war, examples of our army's arduous struggle to achieve victory, and the people's support. Based on our experience over the past few months, the above three parts should be given equal weight when giving reports at representative conferences of various sectors and to cadres of organizations, students, democratic parties, and the cultural circles. When giving reports to the troops, the latter two parts should be more specific and vivid. For workers, peasants, women, and urban residents, more information can be provided about the enemy's atrocities and the people's support for the front lines, and reports on combat achievements can be brief.
　　Third, genuine emotions are most moving. Due to the people's love, care, and respect for the Volunteer Army, due to the fact that we are representatives of the Volunteer Army returning from Korea, and even more because we personally participated in this great and just war and experienced the emotions of the Volunteer Army soldiers, as long as we express the emotions of the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters in concrete and simple language, it will deeply educate the masses and promote their production, work, and study. For example, we said: "In Korea, all we see every day are the enemy's atrocities, and we hear the Korean people tearfully accusing us of the atrocities of American imperialism. We think of our motherland and feel that our motherland is even more lovable. What is the motherland? It is our parents, brothers, sisters, wives, children, cities, villages, factories, schools, hospitals, gardens, and land..." "We have no requests when we return victoriously. We only ask that our compatriots wave to us and say: Comrades, you are back. You have worked hard and won." "When the Volunteer Army comrades think of the motherland, the people of the motherland, and the great leader Chairman Mao, they are filled with strength, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of sacrifice." Although these words are very simple, according to the audience's reaction, they felt them deeply. Wuhan City is currently building roads and stadiums. After we gave the report, many people immediately volunteered to participate in voluntary labor, because they understood what the motherland is and how they should love her.
　　Fourth, materials must be used scientifically. We have been away from Korea for several months. The materials we have reported in the past three months were all prepared four months ago. However, the audience did not feel that the materials were outdated or dissatisfied with our reports. We were once worried that the effect of the reports would be reduced due to the outdated materials, but we learned how to use old materials. In the past, when we gave reports in Beijing, we mainly narrated one battle after another, introducing a lot of stories. Now, we use examples to illustrate the problem. For example, in order to criticize the erroneous view of "weapons determine everything," we admitted in our report that the enemy's weapons were more numerous and better than ours, which was indeed a difficulty for us. However, we then cited specific examples of our bravery and wit in defeating the enemy, and concluded that the victory or defeat of the war depends on the people who hold the weapons. At the same time, during this period, we also supplemented and enriched the content of our reports based on the opinions of the audience, the instructions of the leaders of various places, and the materials we obtained from reading documents and newspapers.
　　Fifth, regarding the issue of organizing the masses to listen to reports in various places, we believe that representative small meetings must be well combined with mass rallies. At mass rallies, because there are many people, the masses cannot easily hear carefully. In order to remedy this defect, it is necessary to speak more and more clearly at various representative conferences, so as to facilitate the representatives to convey to the masses. Generally speaking, at mass rallies, it is only appropriate to make short but highly motivational reports. In addition, it is best to hold a meeting of propagandists in each place, give a detailed report, and carry out propaganda to the broad masses through them.
　　In short, based on our experience over the past few months, giving propaganda reports on resisting America and aiding Korea to the masses does have a certain role in promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Currently, various places are carrying out the donation of aircraft and artillery campaign. We hope that the leading organs in various places can pay more attention to the propaganda reports on resisting America and aiding Korea, and better organize the masses to listen to the reports, so as to help the development of the movement.

### 怎样做好抗美援朝报告？

　　怎样做好抗美援朝报告？
    志愿军归国代表柴川若、董乐辅、窦少毅
    抗美援朝总会按：这篇文章所总结的经验很好，希望志愿军归国代表各工作组和赴朝慰问团各工作组参考。
    我们三人从三月三日开始在华东作报告，前后工作两个月零五天，共作报告一百五十三次，直接听众共二百四十一万六千一百人；五月八日离华东，经九江、上饶等地，十七日至武汉，在中南区共作报告四十三次，听众八十四万。三个月来总计作报告一百九十六次，直接听众共三百二十五万六千一百人；在电台广播八次，收听人数约计七百余万人；夹道迎送的群众在一百万人以上。
    在这一时期的工作中，我们有些体验，现在整理出来，供有关方面参考。
    首先，我们深深体会到，广大人民迫切需要知道志愿军在朝鲜战场上的情况。我们到各地作报告时，受到人民群众如此热烈的欢迎不是偶然的；同时这也说明抗美援朝总会确定的这种宣传方法与给我们规定的宣传要点是完全正确的。抗美援朝运动展开以来，全国人民的政治觉悟有了很大提高，对志愿军普遍热爱与崇敬。但是在没有见到志愿军代表、听到志愿军的报告之前，他们虽是天天在说着抗美援朝，却总觉得朝鲜离自己很远，对抗美援朝运动的伟大意义，也还只停留在抽象的认识上。及至见了志愿军代表、听了报告之后，便立即改变了，他们觉得朝鲜就在眼前，而自己在抗美援朝运动中所尽的那怕是些微的力量，也是直接打击着美国侵略者。人们进一步认清了朝鲜人民解放战争以及中国人民志愿军参战的正义性，加强了胜利信心，并认识到朝鲜战争的艰苦性，懂得了人民的支援是赢得战争的决定因素，而决心全力支援前线。正因为我们的报告会起着上述重大作用，各地负责同志对我们的工作都很重视，给以各种便利，许多地方并有意识地把我们的报告与他们的中心工作结合起来，希望我们的报告能推动当地的中心工作。
    第二，对群众作报告，必须分别对象，各有重点。我们的报告，主要有下列三部分，即：战争的正义性，我军艰苦奋战取得胜利的实例和人民的支援。根据我们几个月来的体验，在各界代表会上，及对机关干部、学生、民主党派、文化界作报告时，上述三部分要用同等力量来讲；向部队作报告时，后两部分要讲得更具体生动一些；对工人、农民、妇女、城市居民，可多介绍敌人的暴行及人民支援前线的情况，报告战斗事绩可以简要一些。
    第三，真实的感情最能动人。由于人民对志愿军的热爱、关怀和崇敬，由于我们是从朝鲜归国的志愿军代表，更由于我们亲身参加了这一伟大的正义战争，体会了志愿军战士的情感，只要把志愿军指挥员和战斗员的情感用具体、朴素的语言表达出来，就会使群众受到深刻的教育，推动他们的生产、工作与学习。譬如，我们说：“在朝鲜，我们天天看见的尽是敌人的暴行，听见朝鲜人民流着泪向我们控诉美帝国主义的暴行，我们就想起了我们的祖国，就觉得祖国更可爱。祖国是什么呢？就是父母，兄弟，姊妹，妻子，儿女，城市，乡村，工厂，学校，医院，田园和土地……。”“我们胜利回来时没有什么要求，只要祖国同胞向我们招招手，说一声：同志们，回来了，你们辛苦了，胜利了。”“志愿军同志一想到祖国，祖国人民，伟大领袖毛主席，就浑身来了力量，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲。”这些话虽然很简单，但根据听众反应，使他们感受很深。武汉市最近正修建马路与体育场，我们作了报告之后，立即有许多人自动报名参加义务劳动，这是因为他们懂得了祖国是什么，和应当如何去爱她。
    第四，要科学地运用材料。我们离开朝鲜已有数月。在近三月中所报告的材料，都是四个月以前准备的。但是，听众对我们的报告并没有觉得材料陈旧，而有所不满。我们曾为材料陈旧而担心报告的效果是否会降低，但是我们学会了运用旧材料的方法。过去在北京作报告时，我们主要是一次战役一次战役地叙述下去，介绍一大堆故事，现在我们则是以例子说明问题。如为了批判“唯武器论”的错误观点，我们在报告时承认敌人的武器比我们多而好，这对我们确是一个困难，但接着便举出我们以勇敢与机智战胜敌人的具体实例，得出战争的胜负决定于拿武器的人的这一结论。同时，这一时期，我们还根据听众的意见，和各地首长的指示，以及自己在读文件、报纸时所获得的材料，补充丰富了我们的报告内容。
    第五，关于各地组织群众听取报告问题，我们认为代表性的小会必须与群众大会很好结合。在群众大会上，因为人多，群众不易听得仔细。为补救这一缺陷，在各种代表会上，就必须讲得多一些，和更清楚一些，以便于代表向群众进行传达。一般来说，在群众大会上，只宜作简短的但鼓动性很强的报告。另外，最好在每地都能开一次宣传员会议，作详细报告，通过他们向广大群众进行宣传。
    总之，根据我们几个月来的体验，向群众进行抗美援朝的传达报告，对抗美援朝运动确有一定的推动作用。现在各地正开展捐献飞机大炮运动，我们希望各地领导机关，对抗美援朝的传达报告能引起更大的重视，更好地组织群众听取报告，以便有助于运动的开展。
