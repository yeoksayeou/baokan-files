　　Hone Your Skills and Be Ready to Strike the American Wolf
　　--First Field Army Combat Hero Liu Sihu's "August 1st" Army Day Radio Address
Comrades:

　　Today is the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Commemorating this day makes me feel both happy and honored. I am happy that under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army has grown from small and weak to large and strong; not only has it protected the security of the motherland, but it has also become a huge force for safeguarding world peace. This force makes any imperialist tremble with fear at the mention of it. I am honored that in the old society, I was a mere apprentice, worse than cattle or horses, but I was rescued by the People's Liberation Army. I love the People's Liberation Army and joined it. Under the education of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and leaders at all levels of the army, I joined the Communist Party, became a cadre in the National Defense Forces, and became a combat hero of the people.

　　I joined the army when I was twenty years old. When I first joined, I didn't have a broad perspective, I only wanted to get rid of the bad guys in my hometown to vent my anger. Later, after class education, I quickly understood that the behind-the-scenes bosses of the bullies were the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek. To make revolution, we must fight against them and eliminate them from the root!

　　In 1946, our troops counterattacked Datong. At that time, I had been in the army for less than a month, had just learned how to prepare to use a gun, all kinds of combat movements were very unfamiliar, and my body was not in good shape. However, when charging, I always rushed to the front; the enemy's bullets were so dense, but they didn't scare me. I had only one thought: I must get rid of the reactionaries! In the first battle, I was seriously injured when a bullet entered my left eye and exited behind my ear. But I was not daunted. I thought: a bullet entered such a vital spot and I didn't die, so hitting elsewhere is even less likely to kill me. Many old comrades have been injured several times; even if I die, it's better than my father being forced to hang himself by others! In just over a month, my injuries healed, and I returned to my unit.

　　The following year, our troops went to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region to protect the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In the battle of Xihuachi in Gansu, our company was assigned to assault and was blocked in a courtyard by the enemy's superior firepower. I volunteered to provide cover, telling other comrades to retreat, leaving only a few wounded soldiers who couldn't retreat and me to defend the position. I was shot twice in the right leg and couldn't stand, so I pulled the pin on a grenade and placed it beside me, preparing to fight the enemy to the death if they came close. But the cowardly enemy never dared to approach us. It wasn't until dark that our troops fought up. This time I gained an experience: as long as you can persevere and have the determination to sacrifice for the people, even in the most critical situation, there is hope of breaking through.

　　In February 1948, we fought against Hu Zongnan's bandit troops led by Liu Kan in Yichuan. At that time, our firepower still couldn't suppress the enemy, and the assault mission was still very dangerous. Our company was assigned the main task of attacking the southeast high ground of Wazijie in Yichuan. The second platoon I led was the assault platoon. When we captured the first hill, one comrade sacrificed. On the second hill, the enemy deployed a regiment of troops, and their military headquarters, division headquarters, and brigade headquarters were all there. On the forward fortifications, an enemy platoon used light and heavy weapons to organize a dense fire net, blocking our path of attack. Of course, we had to eliminate it! We quickly crossed the open ground, and four more comrades fell. We encountered a steep slope, covered with ice and snow, and I climbed up and slid down, reaching a large tree about ten steps away from the enemy in one breath. The enemy discovered us, and grenades exploded all around. While dodging, I used the butt of my gun to push them down, and some I picked up and threw at the enemy.

　　At this time, I looked back and saw that there were only three of us left, including me. Three people is still enough, we'll go up and beat them to death! The three of us launched another fierce charge. Those two comrades fell in the final charge. I was furious, even if I was alone, I had to fight those bastards! Using the smoke from the four grenades I had thrown, I charged into the enemy's position with my bayonet. When the enemy saw me, they ran back in terror. If the enemy doesn't surrender, resolutely eliminate them! I chased and stabbed, and in the time it took to eat a bowl of rice, I stabbed four to death and wounded three. The enemy still wouldn't hand over their guns, so I continued to pursue them fiercely. The enemy commander, seeing that it was just me, used his pistol to force the fleeing enemy to surround me. At this time, my bullets and grenades were all used up, so I held my bayonet and faced the enemy on all sides. The enemy had everything, but they couldn't use it. They couldn't shoot bullets, and they didn't dare to approach with bayonets. Wherever my bayonet pointed, the enemy frantically retreated. The enemy commander threatened his soldiers with execution, pushing them to arrest me, but to no avail.

　　At this time, I heard shouts of killing and charged out. I immediately saw squad leader Shu Zhaoming, who was wrestling with the enemy on the ground. Seeing that the enemy had pinned him to the ground and was about to chop his head with a shovel, I ignored the enemies chasing me and fiercely stabbed the head of the enemy pressing down on Shu Zhaoming. Unexpectedly, the enemy ducked his head, causing me to fall into the trench, my right hand and gun pinned under my body, unable to get up. The enemies chasing me stabbed wildly at my head and face with their bayonets. I desperately resisted with my left hand. Suddenly, I grabbed the enemy's bayonet, wanting to take the opportunity to grab it and flip myself over. The frightened enemy stabbed wildly at my hand. At this time, blood was gushing from my head and body; I fainted and fell down. The enemy thought I was dead and, as a final measure, stabbed me hard in the head and left. I passed out, but I didn't die! I was rescued by my comrades. The Yichuan Campaign was victorious, 40,000 enemies were annihilated, and the enemy's 29th Army Commander Liu Kan was killed. Comrades credited me, and I became a combat hero.

　　Through these experiences, I became even stronger. Death is a trivial matter to me, as long as it is beneficial to the motherland and the people, I am always determined to die. Through these experiences, I gained experience in fighting the enemy, I am not afraid of any enemy, and I am confident in eliminating them!

　　Last year, American imperialism invaded Korea and bombed our Northeast. I expressed my determination to the Party, willing to obey the Party's call at any time and go to the forefront of defending the motherland. I attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes in Beijing. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally urged us to accelerate the construction of a strong national defense force and be ready to strike the aggressors at any time! I think this is very correct. After returning to Xi'an, I entered the hospital due to illness. Hearing that the troops had launched a vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea and a large-scale military training movement, and also hearing the news that American imperialism was rearming Japan, attempting to independently conclude a peace treaty with Japan, I couldn't bear it. At the mention of Japanese imperialism, I remembered that it had devastated most of China for eight full years: bombing, looting, raping, burning, and killing. How many lives and how much property were lost at the hands of the Japanese invaders! These are all things I witnessed firsthand in my hometown. These blood debts have not yet been settled, the tears of countless people have not yet dried, and American imperialism wants to support this beast again to harm the Chinese people. This is intolerable to anyone. In the hospital, I asked the organization to go to Korea to fight the American devils! The organization did not approve it. I really couldn't bear it. Before my illness was fully recovered, I returned to the army and was transferred from the Sixth Company to the Ninth Company as deputy company commander. At that time, the style of the Ninth Company was relatively lax. I kept in mind the words of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu that we must be regularized, laxity is not acceptable, and I also kept in mind that Chairman Mao wanted me to play three major roles, so I was determined to improve the Ninth Company. At the beginning of talking about regularization, some comrades' thinking was not clear, they thought: this way we still eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's eight million bandit troops, and some felt that regularization was formalism. I first talked about regularization, and then patiently explained the reasons to everyone, saying that developing consistent, rapid, and accurate actions in peacetime would make us more courageous and tenacious in battle, able to eliminate the enemy. Everyone understood and began to regularize. Originally, it took at least three minutes for the whole company to assemble, but later, it only took more than half a minute. In the past, platoon leaders, clerks, and cultural instructors rarely carried guns during drills, but now, they are all fully armed. In short, various systems in our company have gradually become regularized. I also participated in the training of the five major techniques, teaching everyone and learning from everyone, and I often told everyone that to eliminate American imperialism, we must master the techniques. Everyone's enthusiasm is getting higher and higher, and many comrades have written letters of determination to hone their skills. As soon as it dawns, they get up to practice, and dummies made of grass representing Truman, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek are all targets for throwing grenades and shooting. In order to quickly hone their skills, the comrades seized all the time to study and also created the "standing shooting aiming" for light machine guns. The four major techniques that have been practiced have been greatly improved. Bayonet fighting has reached the level of being heroic, tenacious, accurate, and powerful; grenade throwing has reached an average of more than 42 meters for the whole company. Of course, this result is only preliminary. Under the slogans "What American imperialism fears, we practice" and "Learn the patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteers," we continue to improve our techniques. This is our current action to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose American imperialism's rearmament of Japan!

　　Now, the American imperialists on the Korean battlefield, under the severe blows of our Chinese and Korean People's forces, have been forced to accept the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Peace is our consistent proposition, and of course I hope that this negotiation can be successfully concluded. Judging from the news of the past few days, American imperialism is still obstructing the negotiations, and they are unwilling to withdraw their troops. Therefore, the outcome of the negotiations is still uncertain. The front lines in Korea are still fighting. As the saying goes, "A wolf cannot change its predatory nature." We must be more vigilant and must not relax the movement to resist America and aid Korea in the slightest. On the contrary, we must deepen and popularize this movement. I want to accelerate the regularization and improve the military techniques of our Ninth Company, so that it will always be a fighting team. Only in this way can we truly protect our fruits of victory, cooperate with the powerful forces of peace in the world, completely defeat the war conspiracy of American imperialism, and strive for genuine and lasting peace.

　　练好武艺，随时准备打击美国狼
　  ——一野战斗英雄刘四虎“八一”建军节广播词同志们：
    今天是中国人民解放军二十四周年的生日。纪念这个日子，我觉得又高兴又光荣。高兴的是：人民解放军，在共产党、毛主席和朱总司令的领导下，从又小又弱，发展到又大又强；不但保卫了祖国的安全，也成了保卫世界和平的一支巨大的力量。这个力量，不论那个帝国主义，一提起就胆战心惊。我感到光荣的是：我在旧社会，是个不如牛马的小学徒，被解放军救了出来。我爱解放军，当了解放军。在共产党、毛主席和部队各级首长的教育下，我参加了共产党，当了国防军的干部，成了人民的战斗英雄。
    我是二十岁上参军的。刚参军时，我的眼睛看不远，只想干掉家乡的那些坏家伙，出一口气。到后来，经过阶级教育以后，我很快的懂得了，恶霸的后台老板就是帝国主义和蒋介石。干革命就得要和他们作斗争，要从根子上把他们消灭掉！
    一九四六年，我们部队反击大同。那时，我参军还不到一个月，刚学会预备用枪，各种战斗动作都很生疏，身体也不好。可是，在冲锋时，我总冲在最前头；敌人的子弹那么密集，也没吓住我。我只有一个想法：非把反动派干掉不行！第一仗，我受了重伤，子弹从左眼打进去，从耳朵后边出来。但我并没有胆怯。我想：子弹从这样要紧的地方打进去，都没死，打到别处，更不一定死了。老战友们受过几次伤的还很多的；就算死了，也比我父亲被人家逼着上吊死了强！不过一个月，我伤好了，又回到自己的连队。
    第二年，我们的部队开到陕甘宁边区，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。在甘肃的西华池战斗中，我们连队担任突击，被敌人优势的火力封锁在一个院子里。我自告奋勇，担任掩护，叫别的战友往外撤，只剩下几个撤不出去的伤员，和我坚守阵地。我的右腿中了两弹，支持不住，倒在地上了；那时我便把手榴弹的线拉开，放在身边，准备敌人到跟前来，就和他拼。但是，胆小的敌人，始终没敢接近我们。直到天黑，我们部队打上来。这回我得了个经验：只要能坚持，有为人民牺牲的决心，再危急，也有杀开活路的希望。
    一九四八年二月，在宜川打胡宗南匪军刘戡。那时我们的火力，还压不住敌人，突击任务，仍是十分危险。我们连队担任攻取宜川瓦子街东南高地的主攻任务。我所领导的二班，是突击班。攻下第一个山头时，一个战友就牺牲了。第二个山头上，敌人布置了一个团的兵力，他们的军部、师部、旅部都在那里。前沿工事上，敌人一个排用轻重武器组织严密的火网，封锁着我们进攻的道路。我们当然要消灭它！我们飞快地通过了开阔地，又有四个战友倒下去了。我们又碰上个陡坡，满是冰雪，我爬上滑下的，一口气穿到离敌人十来步远的一棵大树面前。敌人发觉了，一颗颗手榴弹打过来，前后左右都在爆炸。我一面躲，一面拿枪托推下去，有的就拾起来打敌人。
    这时，我回头一看，连我只剩下三个人了。三个人就三个人，上去了就得揍死它一堆！我们三个人又发起勇猛的冲锋。那两个战友在最后冲锋中，倒下去了。我气极了，一个人也得和狗日的干！我利用着自己打出去的四个手榴弹的烟雾，端着刺刀，冲进敌人阵地。敌人一见我，就抱头往回窜。敌人不投降，就坚决消灭他！我就追着刺，一碗饭的工夫，刺死了四个，刺伤了三个。敌人还不交枪，我继续猛追上去。敌人的指挥官，一看只我一个人，便用手枪逼着乱跑的敌人，把我包围住了。这时，我的子弹、手榴弹都打光了，便端着刺刀，前后左右，转着对付敌人。敌人什么都有，但没法施展。子弹既不能打，刺刀也不敢逼近。我的尖刀指向那边，那边的敌人便忙乱后退。敌人指挥官用枪毙来威胁他的兵，用手推他的兵，叫逮捕我，但都没有用。
    这时我听到一阵喊杀声，便猛冲出去。一眼看到是一班长舒照明，正和敌人滚在一起拼。眼看敌人把他压到地上，用铁锹砍他的头。我没顾追我的敌人，猛力向压着舒照明的敌人头盖刺去，不料敌人头一缩，把我闪落到交通沟里，右手和枪，压在身下，翻不起来了。追我的敌人，用刺刀向我头上、脸上乱刺。我用左手拼命抵抗。猛然，我抓住了敌人的刺刀，想趁势捉住它翻起来。吓得敌人向我手上乱刺。这时，我的头上、身上直冒血；我昏了，倒下去了。敌人以为我死了，最后还在我的头上用劲刺了一刀，走了。我昏了过去，但没有死！我被战友们救回来了。宜川战役胜利了，四万敌人被歼灭了，敌人二十九军军长刘戡被打死了。同志们给我记了功，成了战斗英雄。
    经过这一些锻炼，我更坚强了。死，对我是淡事，只要对祖国、对人民有利，我时刻有死的决心。经过这一些锻炼，我打敌人有了经验了，任何敌人，我都不怕，而且有把握消灭它！
    去年，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，又轰炸我们东北，我就向党表示了决心，愿意随时听从党的号召，到保卫祖国的最前线去。在北京参加了全国战斗英雄代表会议，毛主席和朱总司令都亲口叮咛我们，加紧建设强大的国防军，随时准备打击侵略者！我想这很对。回到西安，我因病进了医院。听到部队开展了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动和大练兵运动，又听到美帝国主义重新武装日本，企图单独和日本媾和的消息，我忍不住了。一提起日本帝国主义，就想起它曾把多半个中国整整糟踏了八年：轰炸、抢掠、奸淫、烧杀。多少人命、多少财产，都丢在日寇的手里！这都是我在家乡亲眼看到的。这些血账还没有清，无数人的眼泪还没有干，美帝国主义又想把这个野兽扶持起来，一起来残害中国人民。这是谁也不能容忍的。我在医院，就向组织要求到朝鲜去，打美国鬼子！组织上没批准。我确实忍不住了。病还没痊好，就回到了部队，我由六连调到九连当副连长。当时，九连作风比较散漫。我牢记着毛主席、朱总司令的话，我们要正规化，散漫是不行的，我也牢记着毛主席要我起三大作用，我就决心把九连搞好。开始讲正规，有些同志的思想还搞不通，他们认为：就这个样儿也把蒋介石八百万匪军消灭了，有的还觉得正规是形式主义。我首先讲正规，然后又耐心地给大家讲清道理，说平时养成行动一致、迅速准确，打起仗来就更勇猛顽强，能消灭敌人，大家想通了，开始正规了。原先全连集合时至少也得三分钟，后来，只需要半分多钟。过去，排长、文书、文化教员等，出操很少带枪，现在，都是全副武装了。总之，我们连上的各种制度，已经逐渐正规化了。练五大技术，我也参加练，教大家，又向大家学习，再加上我时常给大家讲，要消灭美帝国主义，必须练好技术。大家的情绪，越来越高，许多同志写了练好武艺的决心书。天一亮，就起来练，用草作的杜鲁门、李承晚、蒋介石，都是投弹、射击的目标。同志们为了很快地练好武艺，抓紧一切时间钻研，还创造了轻机枪的“立射瞄准”。练过的四大技术，都有很大的提高。刺杀，达到了英勇顽强，准确有力；投弹全连平均四十二米多。当然，这个成绩还是初步的。我们在“美帝国主义怕什么，我们练什么”、“学习志愿军的爱国主义与国际主义精神”等口号下，继续提高技术。这就是我们目前抗美援朝，反对美帝国主义重新武装日本的行动！
    现在，朝鲜战场上的美帝国主义，在我们中朝人民部队的严重打击下，被迫接受用和平方式解决朝鲜问题。和平是我们一贯的主张，当然我希望这个谈判能顺利成功。从这几天的消息看来，美帝国主义还在阻碍谈判的进行，他们不愿意撤退军队。所以，谈判的结果怎样，还说不定。现在朝鲜前线还在战斗着。俗话说：“狼改不了吃人的野性”，我们要更加提高警惕，丝毫不能松懈抗美援朝运动，相反的，更要深入普及这一运动。我要加紧把我们九连的正规化和军事技术提高，使它永远成为战斗队。只有这样，才能真正保卫住我们的胜利果实，才能配合全世界的强大的和平力量，彻底打垮美帝国主义的战争阴谋，才能争取真正持久的和平。
