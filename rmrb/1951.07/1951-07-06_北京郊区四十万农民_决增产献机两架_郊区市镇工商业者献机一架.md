Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: Forty thousand farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have resolved to increase production and donate two airplanes, named "Beijing Farmer" and "Beijing Farm Woman." More than five thousand industrial and commercial households in the suburban townships have also proposed donating one airplane, named "Jingjiao Industry and Commerce."

Farmers in various villages are now actively formulating plans for increased production and donation. The village head of Laodian Village in the western suburbs plans to grow forty more wax gourds. Farmer Xue Jiang plans to plant an additional five fen of land with peppers and donate the proceeds from the harvest. Chen, an elderly woman farmer from Nanyuan Village in the southern suburbs, plans to hatch two more broods of chicks, estimating that they can be sold for 200,000 yuan, and she will donate 100,000 yuan. Ma Yuping, a farmer from the western suburbs, plans to work in a lime kiln during the agricultural off-season, earning seventy jin of millet, all of which he will donate. Women representatives from Fengtai held a meeting and decided to organize 300 people to collect grass, which could generate an income of 45 million yuan in a month, half of which will be donated. Many proactive farmers held family meetings to mobilize the whole family to jointly decide on plans for increased production and donation. Xu Wenyuan, a farmer from Laojuntang in the southern suburbs, pledged to donate six dou of rice at the representative meeting. After returning home, he used the bitterness of the past to enlighten his family by comparing their lives before and after liberation. The whole family's ideological awareness was greatly improved, and they jointly decided to donate one shi of rice. After returning home from the representative meeting, Ma Wenming, a farmer from Taipingqiao Village, discussed with his wife and revised their patriotic production increase and donation plan, deciding to increase the donation figure from 100 jin of rice to 160 jin of rice.
