    Sending Military Provisions

    (1) In Korea, a mother carries her child on her back, carrying grain on her head, delivering food to the front lines.
    (2) Climbing over mountain after mountain, the grain and the child become too much for her to bear. Hurrying as fast as she can, she still falls behind the group.
    (3) She sits wearily on the roots of a large tree, gazing at the grain, anxiously grabbing her hair. She thinks about abandoning the grain to send the child home.

    （一）在朝鲜，一个母亲背着她的孩子，头荷着粮食，给前线送粮食。
    （二）爬过一山又一山，粮食、孩子压得她实在支持不住了，紧赶慢赶，还是掉了队。
    （三）她无力地在一棵大树根上坐了下来，望着粮食，焦急地抓着头发，她想丢下粮食送孩子回家。
