　　Comrade Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi Personally Led the Revolutionary Struggle of Pingxiang Coal Miners Twenty-Nine Years Ago
　　-- Veteran Workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine Talk About the Glorious History of That Time at a Recollection Symposium
　　Veteran workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine (formerly Anyuan Coal Mine, which had 12,000 workers at the time), who were personally led by Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and Li Lisan in a revolutionary struggle twenty-nine years ago, held a recollection symposium on June 18 to recount that glorious history. Their narratives deeply educated the young workers and labor model representatives of Pingxiang Coal Mine who attended the symposium.
　　Zhang Ying, director of Pingxiang Mining Bureau and a former Anyuan miner, said: "In the winter of 1921, Chairman Mao came to Anyuan and went deep into the mines to encourage workers to set up night schools and trade unions; later, after Chairman Mao left Anyuan, the workers learned that he was Comrade Mao Zedong. Soon after, Chairman Mao sent Comrades Li Lisan, Liu Shaoqi, and others to Anyuan successively to lead the workers' movement." At that time, Chairman Mao was the secretary of the CPC Hunan District Committee, which included the Anyuan area of Pingxiang, Jiangxi.
　　Old worker Huang Shaoshang described what he saw when Chairman Mao came to Pingxiang, saying: "At that time, Chairman Mao was wearing a set of blue cloth clothes, carrying an umbrella, and was tall. He spoke to the workers very kindly. Chairman Mao taught us workers to organize and resolutely fight against bureaucratic capitalists and counter-revolutionary forces."
　　Old worker Tan Bingfang said: "In 1922, Chairman Mao sent Comrade Li Longzhi (i.e., Comrade Li Lisan) to Anyuan, first to run a school for workers' children in Niujiaopo, and later a workers' supplementary school, often explaining some principles to the workers. He told us that a wage of 500 cash a day was too unreasonable and that we should strive to increase wages and that bureaucratic capitalists and feudal contractor bosses were not allowed to beat and scold workers. We asked him: 'Old Li, if we want to increase wages, where will the money come from?' He said: 'The money should be demanded from the bureaucratic capitalists; their money is the workers' blood and sweat. As long as we unite and fight, we can do it.' The workers all listened to him, and our trade union (Anyuan Coal Mine Workers' Club) was established."
　　Sixty-one-year-old Li Tingyu talked about a strike struggle shortly after the establishment of the trade union. He said: "In August 1922, 12,000 Anyuan miners, under the leadership of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Li Lisan, held a strike to resist the oppression and exploitation of bureaucratic capitalists; the workers put forward the slogan of 'We were cattle and horses before, now we want to be human beings.' Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Li Longzhi taught us workers: 'The more oppression, the more resistance.' The reactionaries brought out machine guns and artillery to suppress the striking workers, but under the leadership of the Communist Party, no one was intimidated. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, regardless of his own safety, represented the workers in negotiations with the bureaucratic capitalists, putting forward eighteen conditions for resumption of work. At that time, the workers were all worried about Comrade Liu Shaoqi and did not want to let him go into the tiger's den alone, so thousands of workers escorted their representative, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, to negotiate with the reactionaries. The strike was victorious, and the bureaucratic capitalists were forced to accept the thirteen main demands put forward by the workers. Afterwards, the workers all said: 'Liu Shaoqi has great courage!'"
　　The victory of the Anyuan miners' strike at that time improved the workers' lives and raised their political status. Huang Jingcheng, who had been a miner in Pingxiang for more than 40 years, said: "The bureaucratic capitalists did not care about the workers' lives at all. At that time, the Hanyeping Company's steel was continuously transported to Japan to make guns and cannons for Japanese imperialism to fight the Chinese people. Since Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Li Longzhi came to Anyuan to set up a trade union that year, they united everyone and fought for many rights. After the victory of the strike, we all increased our wages, with the wages of small workers increasing from eight cents to eighteen cents a day, and the wages of large workers increasing from one or two dimes to three dimes or more. Workers' death and injury compensation increased from 70 yuan to 160 yuan. At the same time, we also fought for the right to set up trade unions, and the working hours were reduced from more than twelve hours a day to eight hours. It was stipulated that the capitalists could not arbitrarily dismiss workers or beat and scold workers..."
　　However, the workers' movement later temporarily entered a low ebb, and the Anyuan workers' movement suffered repeated setbacks, and the Anyuan workers fell back into the white terror and the tragic situation of being cruelly exploited. At this time, the Communists bore the brunt of the attacks and were massacred by counter-revolutionaries. Many Communists sacrificed heroically for the interests of the working class.
　　Li Tingyu recalled the situation at the time, saying: "In August 1925, the counter-revolutionary army besieged Anyuan, the Workers' Club was closed, the responsible cadres of the trade union were arrested, the workers Duan Zhifa and another worker Liu were shot and killed, and Communists Zhou Huaide, Liu Changyan, and others were hacked to death with hoes, and their bodies were not recovered. Comrade Huang Jingyuan, the director of the trade union at the time, was arrested and taken to Pingxiang County. The reactionaries asked him: 'If we release you, will you still do Communist things?' Comrade Huang Jingyuan replied: 'As long as I live, I will fight for the interests of the working class; I am a Communist, you can kill one Huang Jingyuan, but you cannot kill thousands of Huang Jingyuans!' When being escorted to the execution ground, martyr Huang Jingyuan shouted slogans such as 'Workers of the world, unite!' and 'Long live the Communist Party!', and died heroically."
　　In 1926, the "National Revolutionary Army" launched the Northern Expedition to Anyuan, and the local workers' movement was revived, but after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, it suffered another setback. However, the Anyuan workers continued to struggle heroically under the leadership and influence of the Communist Party. From their failures, they gradually understood the importance of establishing their own armed forces. The old workers said: During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, batches of workers from the Pingxiang Coal Mine participated in the Peasant Movement Training Institute held by Chairman Mao in Guangzhou and the Independent Regiment led by General Ye Ting. In the early days of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, large numbers of miners followed Chairman Mao up Jinggang Mountain. In 1930, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army attacked Changsha and passed through the Anyuan Coal Mine, the workers again joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in large numbers and formed an "Engineer Battalion." Those who left went forward, while those who stayed behind continued to persist in the heroic struggle under the leadership and influence of the Party.
　　The old workers, young workers, and labor models who attended the symposium looked at the martyr's memorial tower that had just been built at the foot of the mountain and the garden surrounding the tower. Thinking of the free and happy life today, they more deeply realized the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party and the working class. Deng Weny, a national labor model, said: "I did not catch up with the revolutionary struggle of the Anyuan workers, but comparing the past with the present, the improvement in life is many times greater. In a word, without the Communist Party, there would be no emancipation of the workers. We can only resolutely respond to all the calls of the Communist Party, vigorously launch the patriotic production increase and donation of airplanes and artillery movement, resolutely expose and suppress all counter-revolutionaries lurking in the mines, thoroughly implement democratic reforms, do a good job in safe production, ensure the overfulfillment of production tasks, and build a new mine for the people to repay the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and use these practical actions to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China."

### 毛主席和刘少奇等同志在二十九年前亲自领导萍乡煤矿工人进行革命斗争——萍乡煤矿老工人在回忆座谈会上谈当年的光荣历史

　　毛主席和刘少奇等同志在二十九年前
    亲自领导萍乡煤矿工人进行革命斗争
    ——萍乡煤矿老工人在回忆座谈会上谈当年的光荣历史
    曾在二十九年前亲受毛主席和刘少奇、李立三同志领导进行革命斗争的萍乡煤矿（即旧安源煤矿，当时有工人一万二千人）老工人，曾在六月十八日举行回忆座谈会，叙述那一段光荣历史。他们的叙述使参加座谈会的萍乡煤矿青年工人和劳动模范代表都受到了深刻的教育。
    曾经是安源矿工的萍乡矿务局局长张瑛说：“一九二一年冬，毛主席来到安源，深入矿井劝导工人办夜校、办工会；随后毛主席离开安源，工人才知道这就是毛泽东同志。不久毛主席便派李立三、刘少奇等同志先后来安源领导工人运动。”当时毛主席是中共湖南区包括江西萍乡安源地区委员会书记。
    老工人黄绍裳叙述他看见毛主席来萍乡时的情况说：“当时毛主席穿着一套青布衣，背着一把雨伞，高高的个子，对工人们谈话很亲切。毛主席教导我们工人，要组织起来，坚决和官僚资本家、反革命势力作斗争。”
    老工人谭炳方说：“一九二二年毛主席派李隆郅同志（即李立三同志）到安源来，先在牛角坡办工人子弟学校，后来又办工人补习学校，经常对工人讲一些道理。他告诉我们五百钱一天的工资太不合理了，要争取提高工资，并且不准官僚资本家和封建包工老板打骂工人。我们问他：‘老李，我们要增加工资，钱从那里来呢！’他说：‘钱向官僚资本家去要，他们的钱都是工人的血汗。只要我们团结斗争，就做得到。’工人都听他的话，这样我们的工会（安源煤矿工人俱乐部）便成立起来了。”
    六十一岁的李廷玉，谈工会成立后不久的一次罢工斗争。他说：“一九二二年八月间，安源矿工一万二千人在刘少奇和李立三同志领导下，为反抗官僚资本家的压迫和剥削举行了罢工；工人们提出了‘先前是牛马，现在要作人’的斗争口号。刘少奇和李隆郅同志教导我们工人：‘愈压迫，愈反抗’。反动派把机枪大炮一起拿来镇压罢工工人，但工人在共产党领导下，没有一个人被吓倒的。刘少奇同志不顾生死，代表工人向官僚资本家去交涉，提出复工条件十八条。那时工人们都为刘少奇同志担心，不肯让他一个人走入虎口，于是几千个工人群众拥着他们的代表——刘少奇同志，到反动派那里去交涉。罢工胜利了，官僚资本家被迫接受了工人所提出的十三条主要要求。事后工人们都说：‘刘少奇一身是胆！’。”
    当时安源矿工罢工斗争的胜利，使工人的生活得到改善，政治地位也提高了。在萍矿作了四十多年矿工的黄镜澄说：“官僚资本家是不管工人死活的，当时汉冶萍公司的钢铁源源运到日本去，给日本帝国主义制造枪炮来打中国人。自从那年刘少奇、李隆郅同志到安源办工会后，把大伙儿团结起来了，争到了许多权利。罢工胜利，我们都增加了工资，小工工资由每天八分增到一角八分，大工由一角、二角增到三角以上。工人伤亡抚恤金由七十元增到一百六十元。同时又争到了办工会的权利，工作时间由每天十二小时以上减到八小时，规定资方不得任意解雇工人，不得打骂工人……。”
    但是以后工人运动暂时转入低潮，安源工人运动接连受到挫折，安源工人重又陷入白色恐怖和被残酷剥削的惨境。这时共产党员们首当其冲，受到反革命分子的屠杀，许多共产党员为着工人阶级的利益而壮烈地牺牲了。
    李廷玉回忆当时的情形说：“一九二五年八月，反革命军队围攻安源，工人俱乐部被封闭，工会的负责干部被捕，工人段志发和另一工人刘某被枪杀，共产党员周怀德、刘昌炎等被用锄头砍死，尸首也没有收到。当时的工会主任黄静源同志被捕后押往萍乡县。反动派问他：‘把你放出去，你还做不做共产党的事？’黄静源同志回答说：‘只要我活一天，我便要为工人阶级的利益作斗争；我是共产党员，你杀了一个黄静源，但杀不了千万个黄静源！’在解往刑场时，黄静源烈士高呼‘全世界无产阶级联合起来’、‘共产党万岁’等口号，慷慨地就义了。”
    一九二六年，“国民革命军”北伐到了安源，当地工人运动曾再度兴起，但到一九二七年蒋匪介石背叛革命后，又遭受挫折。可是安源工人仍继续在共产党的领导和影响下英勇斗争。他们从失败中渐渐懂得了建立自己武装力量的重要性。老工人讲到：第一次国内革命战争时期，萍乡煤矿的工人一批批参加了毛主席在广州举办的农民运动讲习所和叶挺将军率领的独立团。第二次国内革命战争初期，矿工们大批地跟着毛主席上了井岗山。一九三○年中国工农红军攻长沙路经安源煤矿时，工人们又大批参加了工农红军，成立了“工兵营”。走的朝前走了，留下的则继续在党的领导与影响下坚持了英勇的斗争。
    参加座谈会的老工人、青年工人和劳动模范们，遥望着山脚下才建立起来的烈士纪念塔以及环绕塔下的花园，想到今天自由幸福的生活，他们更深刻地体会到共产党和工人阶级的血肉关系。全国劳动模范邓文益说：“我没有赶上安源工人的革命斗争，但我比比过去，想想现在，生活不知改善了多少倍。一句话，没有共产党便没有工人的翻身。我们只有坚决响应共产党的一切号召，努力展开爱国增产捐献飞机大炮运动，坚决检举和镇压一切潜伏在矿山上的反革命分子，彻底实行民主改革，作好安全生产，保证超额完成生产任务，建设人民的新矿山，来报答毛主席和共产党的恩情，用这些实际行动来庆祝中国共产党三十周年的纪念日。”
