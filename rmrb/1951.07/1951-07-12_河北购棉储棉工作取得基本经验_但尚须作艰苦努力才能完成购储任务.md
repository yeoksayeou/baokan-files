　　Since the central and Hebei provincial Party and government leading organs issued instructions on promoting the patriotic sale and storage of cotton by the broad masses of cotton farmers, selling and storing cotton has become a practical action for the broad masses of cotton farmers in Hebei Province. From June 1st to 30th, the province has purchased and stored 7.4 million catties of ginned cotton (equivalent to 24.66 million catties of seed cotton). Shijiazhuang Prefecture alone purchased more than 1.26 million catties. At present, cotton farmers in various places are further selling and storing in large quantities. However, the achievements of Hebei Province in purchasing and storing cotton in June are still far from the tasks assigned by the state, and hard work is still needed. Based on the existing experience, the following points should be noted when carrying out this movement:

  Promote Patriotic Pledges · Strengthen Political Education
    (1) It is necessary to promote patriotic pledges, carry out patriotic education, and explain that selling and storing cotton is a practical action to resist US aggression and aid Korea; and further explain that the people's government has always adopted policies to reward cotton planting and take care of farmers' interests, so that cotton farmers have become prosperous, but farmers must also fully supply the needs of the country. In many places in Hebei, cotton farmers, led by Party members, cadres, and labor models, have inspired patriotism and unanimously put forward slogans such as "selling patriotic cotton" and "storing cotton to resist US aggression." In Henggu Village, Fengnan, under the leadership of the CCP branch members, the masses of the whole village sold all 14,000 catties in stock to the state in four days.

  Establish Unified Institutions · Strengthen Leadership and Inspection
    (2) Leading cadres at all levels generally attach importance to this work. With Party and government responsible cadres as the core, relevant departments (banks, cotton yarn and cloth companies, cooperatives, etc.) are absorbed to form joint cotton purchase committees to promote various departments to organize forces and closely combine with the central work to carry out the patriotic sale and storage of cotton movement. Dingxian Prefecture established cotton sale and storage committees from the prefecture to the village level. The prefecture took the secretary of the prefectural committee and the commissioner as the director and deputy director, and established a joint office with the financial and economic committee as the main body to specifically guide the cotton sale and storage work. The governments and CCP committees at all levels in the prefecture held meetings of Party member cadres, commune members, militia, the masses, and cotton storage households respectively to mobilize them. In order to deeply guide this work, leading organs from the province to the county level organized a large number of cadres to go deep into districts and villages to conduct inspections and provide assistance, and discovered many problems. For example, some leading cadres in Xinle County, Dingxian Prefecture, were not good at combining cotton sale and storage with other work, and carried out the purchase work in isolation, which led the cotton purchase work astray; Nan Su Zhuang and Zhu Lin, two key villages in Xinle County, only received 430 catties due to the lack of in-depth work (cotton farmers actually had more than 5,000 catties of cotton). Some counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture found problems such as forcing the masses to sell cotton. These mistakes were criticized and corrected in a timely manner.

  Strictly Manage the Market · Pay Attention to Educating Private Merchants
    (3) Strictly managing the market and strengthening patriotic education are effective measures to stabilize cotton prices and prevent private merchants from competing for purchases. Experience has proved that those who have done so have received a large amount of cotton; those who have not done so, using coercive orders, cannot complete the task. Price gouging by private merchants has occurred in various places. Leading cadres in various places promptly convened meetings of merchants, cotton dealers, and traders to conduct education on resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and promoting patriotic pledges, and stipulated specific measures for market management. Cotton yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives clearly divided their responsibilities, unified market price signs, and reduced regional differences. After this series of work, merchants generally not only stopped competing for purchases, but also sold the original cotton in stock to the state. For example, after Jin County held a meeting of 34 cotton dealers, 30 people automatically sold 15,000 catties of cotton to the state, and proposed: "The patriotic pledge has been written to assist the government in stabilizing prices. If we want to resist US aggression and aid Korea, we will never do this business again." Thirty-one cotton merchants in nine villages in the Second District of Shulu, after education, also voluntarily sold the original 14,400 catties of seed cotton and more than 1,000 catties of ginned cotton to the state. After appropriately adjusting market prices and strengthening market management, private merchants stopped competing for purchases, and the amount of cotton on the market increased greatly. The amount of cotton on the general market increased by one to eight times. Xinji generally only had 3,000 to 4,000 catties of cotton on the market on a regular market day, but later increased to more than 25,700 catties. The small market town of Weibao increased from 3,700 catties of cotton per day to more than 14,300 catties. This facilitated the cotton collection work. Shulu received more than 753,000 catties in only ten days, and Fengnan County also purchased more than 100,000 catties of ginned cotton in more than half a month. However, some areas did the opposite. Instead of actively strengthening market management, they did not educate and raise the awareness of merchants, but simply restricted and supervised merchants to sell their cotton, and as a result, they did not receive much cotton.

  Set up a Large Number of Cotton Collection Stations · Facilitate Mass Storage and Sales
    (4) In addition to organizing work groups to go to key cotton producing area villages for purchase, cotton yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives in various places have greatly increased the number of cotton collection stations. Tianjin Prefecture added 13 cotton collection markets, Shijiazhuang Prefecture added 260 cotton collection stations in various counties, and supplied cotton farmers with daily necessities at the same time. Qingyuan changed the five offices of the bank into cotton collection stations, each station was equipped with a bank cadre; in addition, all 72 grassroots cooperatives in the county acted as purchasing agents, and set up cotton collection stalls in 40 market towns. Wangdu County Cooperative also combined its own business and exchanged cloth for cotton with the countryside. Baoding Prefecture established 92 cotton collection stations mainly based on grassroots cooperatives, and collected a total of 200,156 catties of ginned cotton from the 10th to the 20th of this month. After Quzhou County collected cotton, it supplied a large number of various necessities; for example, it transported 60 boats of coal at a time, which were sold out in three days. Various places also promoted the sale of a large number of bean cakes, waterwheels and various agricultural implements in a timely manner.

### 河北购棉储棉工作取得基本经验  但尚须作艰苦努力才能完成购储任务

　　河北购棉储棉工作取得基本经验
    但尚须作艰苦努力才能完成购储任务
    自中央和河北省党、政领导机关发出关于推动广大棉农开展爱国售棉储棉指示以来，售储棉花已成为河北省广大棉农的实际的行动。由六月一日至三十日，全省已购储皮棉七百四十万斤（合籽棉二千四百六十六万斤），仅石家庄专区即收购了一百二十六万多斤。目前各地棉农正在进一步大量售储中。但河北省在六月份购棉储棉的成绩，离国家所分配的任务仍相去很远，还须作艰苦的努力。就已有的经验看来，开展这一运动时，应注意以下几点：
  推行爱国公约·加强政治教育
    （一）要推行爱国公约，进行爱国主义教育，说明售棉储棉即是抗美援朝的实际行动；并进一步说明了人民政府历来就采取奖励植棉和照顾农民利益的政策，使棉农发了家，但农民也必须充分供给国家的需要。河北许多地方的棉农经过党员、干部、劳动模范的带头，激发了爱国心，一致提出“卖爱国棉”、“存抗美棉”等口号。丰南横沽村在中共支部党员带动下，全村群众四天把所存的一万四千斤都卖给了国家。
  设立统一机构·加强领导检查
    （二）各级领导干部一般都重视这个工作，以党、政负责干部为核心吸收有关部门（银行、花纱布公司、合作社等）组织联合购棉委员会，推动各个部门组织力量，与中心工作密切结合，开展了爱国售棉储棉运动。定县专区从专区至村都建立了售储棉花委员会，专区以地委书记和专员为正副主任，并以财政经济委员会为主，建立了联合办公室，具体指导售棉储棉工作。该专区各级政府和中共党委分别召开了党员干部、社员、民兵、群众、存棉户等会议进行动员。为深入指导这一工作，省至县各级领导机关都组织了大批干部深入区村，进行检查与帮助，发现了许多问题。如定县专区新乐县有些领导干部在售储棉花中不善于与其他工作结合，孤立地进行收购工作，使收棉工作走了弯路；新乐县南苏庄、朱林两重点村，由于工作不深入，只收到四百三十斤（实际棉农有棉五千多斤）。石家庄专区有的县发现强迫群众卖棉等问题。这些错误都得了及时的批判和纠正。
  严格管理市场·注意教育私商
    （三）严格管理市场，加强爱国主义教育，是稳定棉价制止私商争购的有效措施。经验证明：凡这样做了的就大量的收到棉花；不这样作的，用强迫命令的办法，完不成任务。各地都曾发生私商抬价争购的事。各地领导干部及时召开了商人、棉贩、交易员会议，进行抗美援朝与推行爱国公约的教育，规定市场管理具体办法。花纱布公司与合作社明确分工，并统一市价牌价，缩小地区差额。经过这一系列的工作后，商贩一般不但停止了争购，并把原存棉花卖给国家。如晋县召开三十四个棉贩会议后，即有三十个人自动把一万五千斤棉花卖给国家，并提出：“爱国公约上已写好协助政府稳定物价，咱们要抗美援朝，就决不再作这生意啦。”束鹿二区九个村三十一户棉商，经过教育，也自愿把原存的一万四千四百斤籽棉和一千多斤皮棉卖给国家。适当调整了市价牌价、加强了市场管理后，私商停止争购，市场上棉量大增，一般市场上棉量增加了一至八倍。辛集一般集日只上棉三、四千斤，后增到二万五千七百多斤。位伯小集镇由日上棉花三千七百斤，增到一万四千三百多斤。这就便利了收棉工作。束鹿仅十天工夫即收进了七十五万三千多斤，丰南县半个多月的工夫亦购进了皮棉十万多斤。但是也有的地区与此相反，不是积极地加强市场管理，不去教育与提高商人的觉悟，而是单纯地限制和监视强迫商人把存棉卖出，结果并没有收到多少棉花。
  大量设收棉站·便利群众存卖
    （四）各地花纱布公司、合作社除组织工作组到重点产棉区村收购外，大量增设收棉站。天津专区增加了十三个收棉市场，石家庄专区在各县增设了二百六十个收棉站，同时供应棉农日用品。清苑将银行五个办事处改为收棉站，每站都配备银行干部一人；此外全县七十二个基层社都代购，并在四十个集镇上设立收棉摊。望都县合作社并结合自己的业务，以布向农村交换棉花。保定专区以基层社为主建立了九十二个收花站，自本月十日至二十日共收了皮棉二十万零一千五百六十五斤。曲周县收了棉花后大量供给了各种必需品；例如一次运煤炭六十船，三天即售卖完毕。各地并及时推销了大量豆饼、水车及各种农具等。
