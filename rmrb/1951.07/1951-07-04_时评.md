(I) The Korean Situation and the Patriotic Movement

With the Chinese and Korean People's Forces giving the American and its accomplice's invading armies a heavy blow, putting the enemy in a dilemma, the current situation in Korea is beginning to change. A Korean armistice, as the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, has become possible. On June 30th, General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations Forces" in Korea, issued a statement expressing his willingness to accept the proposal made by Soviet Representative to the United Nations Malik on June 23rd for ceasefire and truce negotiations between the warring parties, and expressed his readiness to negotiate. On July 1st, General Kim Il-sung, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, jointly issued a statement supporting negotiations with Ridgway and suggesting that the negotiations take place in the Kaesong area on the 38th parallel between July 10th and 15th.

Although negotiations for a cessation of military action in Korea are about to begin, we must be aware that the Korean War has not yet stopped. Whether the ceasefire and truce, as the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, will be realized depends on the sincerity of the US government and the governments of other countries participating in the Korean War, and on the outcome of future negotiations. US government officials have publicly stated: "The war will continue unabated until a ceasefire or truce agreement is signed." (Reuters, Washington, July 1st) Therefore, the Chinese and Korean People's Forces in Korea must continue to fight heroically, guard against possible enemy attacks, and must not slacken in the slightest. Similarly, our national effort to resist America and aid Korea must not be relaxed in the slightest before a ceasefire and truce are achieved. Even after the Korean armistice is realized, our people must make persistent efforts to promote the various anti-American patriotic works we are currently undertaking, especially the work of consolidating national defense.

Our nationwide patriotic convention movement, the movement to donate airplanes and cannons, the movement to give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, the national youth and students' movement to enroll in military cadre schools, the patriotic movement of cotton-producing areas to sell and store cotton, the patriotic production increase movement of workers, peasants, and staff members across the country, the independent and innovative movements of Christianity and Catholicism across the country, and the patriotic anti-espionage movement of urban and rural people across the country should not be relaxed in the slightest due to possible developments in the Korean situation. On the contrary, the people of the whole country must strengthen these movements. This is because the general purpose of our people in carrying out these tasks is to consolidate our great motherland under the banner of great patriotism. Consolidating our motherland is a very long-term task. As long as the imperialist system exists, as long as the imperialist threat of aggression against our country exists, we must continue to consolidate our great motherland. Obviously, even if the imperialists accept the lessons of failure and stop the war of aggression against Korea, this does not mean a complete solution to the Korean issue, let alone the recovery of Taiwan, the just resolution of the Japanese peace treaty issue, and the resolution of other important issues in the Far East. The imperialists still occupy our Taiwan, still control South Korea and Japan, and are still constantly attempting to invade and harm the People's Republic of China. Under these circumstances, the sacred task of our people is to continue to expand our patriotic movement, continue to promote the above-mentioned patriotic work, in order to build a strong and modern national defense force and a strong economic force. Only in this way can we have sufficient strength to recover Taiwan, consolidate national defense, prevent and stop possible future imperialist aggression against our country, and ensure the free and happy lives of our people and restore and defend peace in the Far East.

(II) To carry out the donation movement, we must first do a good job in publicity

To make increased production and weapons donations a passionate and widespread mass movement, we must first do a good job of systematic publicity for increased production and donations, so that every one of the people understands the great role of carrying out this movement in supporting the front lines, consolidating national defense, and promoting industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational construction, and that everyone understands the method of increasing production, increasing income to donate weapons. In the past month, some places have carried out extensive and in-depth publicity work among the people and created good experiences. The experience of Jinzhou in publicizing increased production and donations published in this issue is an example. However, most places have not yet carried out systematic publicity work among the people, the movement to donate weapons has not yet penetrated into the masses, and the enthusiasm of the people to make donations spontaneously has not been effectively organized to make it universal; some local branches have not even discussed and arranged this work. This situation must be changed quickly.

To systematically do a good job in publicizing increased production and donations, the following points are worth noting in various places:

First, cities and counties should convene a joint and separate anti-American and aid-Korea representative conference or work conference of people from all walks of life in the near future, and similar meetings should also be held below the city and county level. Only through such meetings with the participation of representatives of people from all walks of life can the correct policy of carrying out the movement to increase production and donations be implemented among the masses, and the opinions and experiences of the masses can be concentrated, thereby universally mobilizing the patriotic enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to increase production and donations. In its proclamation of June 1st, the Association suggested that all cities and counties across the country hold such meetings in June, but until now, most cities and counties have not yet held such meetings.

Second, it is necessary to combine it with the development of the patriotic convention movement and the movement to give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, once again organize the nationwide propaganda force, and mobilize various propaganda tools to universally carry out propaganda work, and organize the masses to discuss the significance of the Association's three major appeals and methods of responding to the three major appeals. In cotton-producing areas, the patriotic movement to sell and store cotton should be promoted at the same time, and in cities, especially in major universities and middle schools, the movement to enroll in military cadre schools should be emphasized. Propagandists and all patriotic activists in various places must regard doing a good job in these publicity work as the most important political task at the present time.

Third, it is necessary to make full use of the reports of the representatives of the visiting groups to Korea and the returning representatives of the Volunteer Army, organize the transmission of these reports well, and organize the masses to discuss their reports to promote the development of the movement to increase production and donations.

Fourth, it is necessary to call on the masses to formulate plans for increasing production and donations, and incorporate the main contents of the plan into the patriotic convention. For this purpose, it is necessary to consciously collect and promote the good experiences of the people in formulating realistic plans for increasing production and donations and revising the patriotic conventions. Only when the people have all formulated a half-year plan for increasing production and donations, revised the patriotic convention, and implemented it, can it be considered that the publicity work of this movement to increase production and donations has been done well. Only in this way can the movement to increase production and donations become a universal political life of the people across the country.

(III) Attaching importance to the patriotic education of staff and workers' families

In the movement to resist America and aid Korea, trade unions in various places have begun to pay attention to the patriotic education of staff and workers' families. The political consciousness of many staff and workers' families has been greatly improved, which has powerfully promoted the patriotic labor competition in factories and mines. For example, in a certain coal mine in Northeast China, there were eighty or ninety workers who were often late due to family matters in the past; but since the trade union of the coal mine carried out patriotic education among the workers' families, the workers' families and workers challenged each other to compete, and the phenomenon of being late was quickly eliminated. According to incomplete statistics from the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, more than 500,000 industrial workers' families across the country have been organized and regularly receive patriotic education, which has a significant role in promoting various production undertakings. However, the phenomenon of neglecting the education of staff and workers' families is still common in many places. Therefore, until now, there are still tens of millions of staff and workers' families who have not received or have not fully received patriotic education, which deserves the attention of the party organizations, administrative leaders, and trade union organizations in various places and enterprises.

The main reason for neglecting the education of staff and workers' families is that the party, administration, and trade unions in many places and enterprises do not understand the political significance of this work. They doubt whether "strengthening trade union work and doing a good job in the work of staff and workers' families are contradictory" and "whether engaging in the work of staff and workers' families in labor competitions will distract the strength of the trade union." Therefore, although the families of staff and workers in some factories and mines have been organized, the trade union does not lead them. Some places have not even carried out education among the families of staff and workers. This idea is extremely wrong. The importance of the education of staff and workers' families is very obvious: the number of staff and workers' families is not only very large (in general cities, staff and workers plus their families account for about half of the city's population); more importantly, they have a close relationship with the country's economic construction. At the National Women Workers' Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions last year, Vice Chairman Li Lisan clearly pointed out: "Doing a good job in family work is of great political significance for consolidating the people's power and various municipal construction." The decision on strengthening women workers' work issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in September last year clearly stipulates that the work of staff and workers' families is one of the important tasks of the trade union. After the people across the country launched the movement to resist America and aid Korea in November last year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions on the work of staff and workers' families. Over the past eight months, the experience of various places has fully proved that whether the education work of staff and workers' families can be done well depends mainly on whether the party, administration, and trade union of the local factories, mines, and other enterprises attach importance to this work. The reason why the education work of staff and workers' families in Shijingshan Power Plant can achieve remarkable results is mainly because the party, administration, and trade union of the plant regard it as an important part of the plant's propaganda and education work and appoint cadres to be responsible for the education work of staff and workers' families.

How can we do a good job in the patriotic education of staff and workers' families? The most important thing is to fully recognize the characteristics of staff and workers' families. Generally, there are more women and elderly people in the families of staff and workers. Due to the various oppressions and restrictions they suffered in the old society, their political consciousness and cultural level are relatively low. This situation is especially true for the families of workers. Therefore, when conducting education among staff and workers' families, we should adopt methods and methods suitable for this situation. The experience of Shijingshan Power Plant in carrying out propaganda and education among the families of staff and workers is very good and worthy of reference and learning in various places.

In order to make the patriotic education of staff and workers' families continue for a long time, during the propaganda and education process, various places should pay special attention to discovering and cultivating activists among the families of staff and workers, absorb them into family committees, and be responsible for leading and promoting various work related to the families of staff and workers; at the same time, they should also widely establish reading groups and literacy classes among the families of staff and workers in a planned way. In this regard, the Qiqihar Railway Administration District in Northeast China has done a better job. More than 21,000 family members of railway staff and workers in the district have participated in reading groups and literacy classes. The establishment of this fixed organization will make the patriotic education of staff and workers' families regular, and their political consciousness will continue to improve.

    时评
   （一）朝鲜形势和爱国运动
    在中朝人民部队给了美国及其帮凶的侵略军队以沉重的打击，使敌人陷于进退维谷的处境以后，目前朝鲜形势正在开始变化，作为和平解决朝鲜问题第一步的朝鲜停战已有了可能。六月三十日，朝鲜“联合国军”总司令李奇微发表声明，表示愿意接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克在六月二十三日所提出的由交战双方谈判停火和休战的建议，并表示准备谈判。七月一日，朝鲜人民军总司令金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军联合发表声明，赞成与李奇微举行谈判，并建议谈判的地点在三八线上的开城地区，时间在七月十日到十五日。
    朝鲜停止军事行动的谈判，虽然即将开始，但是我们必须注意朝鲜战争目前并没有停止。作为和平解决朝鲜问题第一步的停火和休战是否实现，还要看美国政府及其他参加朝鲜战争的各国政府有无诚意，看今后谈判的结果。美国政府官员已公然宣称：“战争将继续不断地进行，直到停火或停战协定签字时为止。”（路透社华盛顿七月一日电）因此，在朝鲜的中朝人民部队必须继续英勇作战，严防敌人可能的乘机袭击，决不能丝毫松懈。同样地，我们全国人民的抗美援朝工作，在停火和休战实现以前，也决不能有丝毫松懈。即在朝鲜停战实现以后，我们全国人民还必须再接再厉地努力推进我们目前正在进行的各项抗美爱国工作，尤其是巩固国防的工作。
    我们全国人民目前正在进行的爱国公约运动，捐献飞机大炮运动，优待烈属军属运动，全国青年学生正在进行的报名参加军事干部学校运动，各棉产区农民群众正在进行的爱国售棉储棉运动，全国工人农民职员正在进行的爱国增产运动，全国基督教天主教正在进行的自立革新运动，全国城乡人民正在进行的爱国防奸运动，决不应因为朝鲜形势的可能的发展而有丝毫的松懈。相反，全国人民必须加强这些运动。这是因为，我们全国人民进行这些工作的总目的，是为了在伟大的爱国主义旗帜下，巩固我们伟大的祖国。而巩固我们的祖国，是一个极长时期的任务。只要帝国主义制度还存在一天，只要帝国主义对我国的侵略威胁还存在一天，我们就必须继续巩固我们伟大的祖国。很显然，目前帝国主义者即使接受失败的教训，而停止侵略朝鲜的战争，但是这不等于朝鲜问题的完全解决，更不等于台湾的收复，日本和约问题的公正解决，以及远东其他重要问题的解决。帝国主义者仍然侵占着我国的台湾，仍然控制着南朝鲜和日本，仍然时时刻刻企图侵略和危害中华人民共和国。在这种情况下，我们全国人民的神圣任务，就是继续扩大我们的爱国运动，继续推进上述各项爱国工作，以便建设强大的现代化的国防力量和强大的经济力量。只有这样，我们才能有充足的力量去收复台湾，巩固国防，防止和制止帝国主义者今后对我国的可能侵略，而保障我们全国人民的自由幸福的生活，恢复与保卫远东的和平。
    （二）开展捐献运动首先要做好宣传工作
    要使增加生产、捐献武器成为热烈、普遍的群众运动，首先要做好增产捐献的有系统的宣传工作，使人民群众每一个人都明白开展这个运动对于支援前线、巩固国防和推进工农业生产及文化教育建设工作的重大作用，并使大家都明白用增加生产、增加收入来捐献武器的办法。一个月来，有些地方已经在人民群众中展开了广泛深入的宣传工作，创造了很好的经验。本期本刊所发表的锦州市宣传增产捐献的经验，就是一个例子。但是多数地方还没有在人民群众中开展有系统的宣传工作，捐献武器的运动还没有深入到群众中去，对于人民群众中自发地进行捐献的热情，也还没有加以有效的组织，使之普遍化；有的地方分会，甚至还没有讨论和布置这个工作。这种情况，必须迅速加以改变。
    要有系统地做好增产捐献的宣传工作，下列几点是值得各地注意的：
    第一就是各市、县要在最近时间内召开一次各界人民共同的和分别的抗美援朝代表会议或工作会议，各市、县以下，也应该召开同样的会议。只有经过这样的有各界各阶层人民代表参加讨论的会议，才能把开展增产捐献运动的正确方针贯彻到群众中去，并集中群众的意见和群众的经验，从而普遍地发动各界人民增产捐献的爱国积极性。本会在六月一日的文告中，曾经建议全国各个市、县都在六月份内召开这样的会议，但是直到现在，大多数市、县都还没有召开这样的会议。
    第二，就是要与开展爱国公约运动和开展优待烈属军属运动相结合，再一次组织全民性的宣传力量，并动员各种宣传工具，普遍开展宣传工作，并组织群众讨论本会三大号召的意义及响应三大号召的办法。在产棉区应同时宣传爱国售棉及储棉运动，在城市特别是在各大、中学，应着重宣传报名投考军事干部学校运动。各地宣传员和所有爱国积极分子，都要把做好这些宣传工作，看作是目前时期最重要的政治任务。
    第三，就是要充分地运用赴朝慰问团代表及志愿军归国代表的报告，组织好这些报告的传达工作，并组织人民群众讨论他们的报告，来推动增产捐献运动的发展。
    第四，就是要号召群众订出增产捐献的计划来，并把计划的主要内容订入爱国公约。为此目的，就要有意识地收集和推广人民群众中实事求是地订立增产捐献计划和修订爱国公约的好经验。只有人民群众大家都订立了半年的增产捐献计划，修订了爱国公约，并且加以执行，才算是做好了这次增产捐献运动的宣传工作，只有这样，才能使增产捐献运动成为全国人民的普遍的政治生活。
   （三）重视职工家属的爱国主义教育
    在抗美援朝运动中，各地工会开始注意了对职工家属的爱国主义教育。许多职工家属的政治觉悟已经大大提高，有力地促进了工厂矿山中的爱国劳动竞赛。如东北某煤矿，过去因家事牵累、经常迟到的工人有八、九十人；但自该煤矿工会向工人家属进行了爱国主义教育之后，工人家属与工人互相挑战竞赛，很快就消灭了迟到现象。据全国总工会女工部的不完全统计，目前全国已有五十余万产业工人家属组织起来，经常受到爱国主义教育，对各种生产事业有显著推动作用。但忽视职工家属教育的现象在许多地方仍普遍存在，因此，直到现在，仍有数以千万计的职工家属尚未受到或者尚未充分地受到爱国教育，值得引起各地各企业的党组织、行政首长和工会组织的注意。
    忽视职工家属教育工作的主要原因，是许多地方许多企业的党、行政和工会不了解这一工作的政治意义。他们怀疑“加强工会工作与搞好职工家属工作是否矛盾”、“在劳动竞赛中搞职工家属工作，是否会分散了工会的力量。”因而有些工厂和矿山的职工家属虽然已经组织起来，工会也不去领导。有的地方甚至还没有向职工家属进行过教育。这种思想是极端错误的。职工家属教育工作的重要性是十分明显的：职工家属不但人数很多（一般城市是职工加家属约为全市人口之半）；而更重要的，是她们和国家的经济建设有着密切的关系。在去年全国总工会所召集的全国女工工作会议上，李立三副主席曾经明确指出：“把家属工作做好，对于巩固人民政权和各项市政建设，有重大的政治意义。”去年九月全国总工会发出的关于加强女工工作的决定中，更明确规定，职工家属工作是工会的重要工作之一。去年十一月全国人民掀起抗美援朝运动后，全国总工会又发出了关于职工家属工作的指示。八个多月来，各地的经验已充分证明，职工家属的教育工作能否做好，基本关键是在当地的工厂矿山及其他企业的党、行政和工会是否重视这一工作。石景山发电厂的职工家属教育工作所以能做出显著成绩，最主要的原因，是该厂的党、行政和工会把它当成全厂宣传教育工作的重要部分，指定干部专门负责职工家属的教育工作。
    怎样才能做好职工家属的爱国主义教育工作呢？最重要的是要充分认识到职工家属的特点。职工家属中一般以妇女和老年人较多，由于在旧社会里他们遭受种种压迫和限制，因而政治觉悟和文化水平均较低。这种情况尤以工人家属为甚。因此在向职工家属进行教育时，应采取适合于这种情况的方式和方法。石景山发电厂在职工家属中进行宣传教育工作的经验，是很好的，值得各地参考学习。
    为了使职工家属的爱国主义教育工作持久地进行下去，各地在进行宣传教育的过程中，应特别注意发现和培养职工家属中的积极分子，吸收她们组成家属委员会，负责领导和推动有关职工家属的各项工作；同时还应有计划地在职工家属中广泛建立读报组和识字班。在这一方面，东北齐齐哈尔铁路管理区作得较好，该区铁路职工家属参加读报组和识字班的已达两万一千多人。这种固定的组织的建立，就会使对职工家属的爱国主义教育工作经常化，她们的政治觉悟也就会不断获得提高。
