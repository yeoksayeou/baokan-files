　　(II) Continue to Promote the Patriotic Donation Movement of the Industrial and Commercial Circles

　　The patriotic donation movement of industrial and commercial circles in various places has achieved significant results in the past month or so. As of the 7th of this month, according to incomplete statistics from 56 cities and 5 provinces and regions, industrial and commercial circles have pledged to donate 605 airplanes, 10 cannons, 7 anti-aircraft guns, and 1 tank. If the figures for donations from industrial and commercial circles on a regional basis are included, these figures would be even larger. Taking the above figures as an example, the weapons donated by industrial and commercial circles account for about 30 percent of the total number of donations from all sectors of the people across the country (2,047 airplanes, 108 cannons, 46 anti-aircraft guns, and 9 tanks, as of the 7th). This fact shows that the industrial and commercial circles in various places are united with the people of the whole country to shoulder the patriotic responsibility of supporting the front and consolidating national defense. However, just as in other sectors of the people, the patriotic donation movement is not balanced, widespread, and deep enough in the national industrial and commercial circles. The donation movement has not yet been launched in some places. Although it has been launched in some places, the propaganda and education work of patriotic donation has not been deeply rooted in every household, so the donation results are not significant enough. Therefore, like other sectors of the people, the patriotic donation movement of the industrial and commercial circles must continue to be strengthened. Local federations of industry and commerce should assume the main leadership responsibility in this work.
　　In order to continue to promote the patriotic donation movement of industrial and commercial circles, it is first necessary to carry out sufficient current affairs propaganda and patriotic education. The focus of current affairs propaganda at present is to make comrades in industrial and commercial circles unanimously realize the necessity of continuing to strengthen the patriotic donation movement under the current situation. In order to make comrades in industrial and commercial circles realize the significance of donating weapons for supporting the front and consolidating national defense, as well as the reason why industrial and commercial circles themselves should actively participate in this movement, it is necessary to continue to carry out in-depth patriotic education in industrial and commercial circles.
　　Secondly, it should be noted that the donation movement of industrial and commercial circles must be carried out under the guidelines of increasing production, improving management, and reducing waste, and the patriotic conventions should be revised according to these guidelines. When drawing up patriotic conventions, increasing production and donation should be listed as one of the main contents of the convention. According to the experience of industrial and commercial circles in Beijing and other cities in formulating donation plans, such plans should be formulated through consultation between labor and management in order to ensure their implementation and strengthen labor-management unity. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of employees for production or business, a portion of the newly increased income should be used as bonus payments for employees.
　　Finally, in order to highly promote the patriotic enthusiasm of industrial and commercial circles, local federations of industry and commerce can encourage industrial and commercial households and industries to launch patriotic production increase and donation competitions, and formulate appropriate reward methods. The federations of industry and commerce in Tianjin and Hangzhou have decided to reward industries or industrial and commercial households with outstanding donation achievements with banners or honor rolls, which is worthy of reference by various places.

　　（二）继续推进工商界的爱国捐献运动
    各地工商界的爱国捐献运动，在过去一个多月中已经获得显著成绩。截至本月七日为止，根据五十六个城市和五个省区的不完全统计，工商界已认捐了飞机六百零五架、大炮十门、高射炮七门和坦克一辆。若将以地区为单位捐献的工商界的数字统计进去，这些数字还要大一些。即拿上列数字来说，工商界捐献的武器，已占全国各地各界人民捐献总数（七日统计共二千零四十七架飞机，一百零八门大炮，四十六门高射炮，九辆坦克）的百分之三十左右。这个事实说明，各地工商界是和全国人民团结在一起来担当支援前线和巩固国防的爱国责任的。但是正和在其他各界人民中的情形一样，爱国捐献运动在全国工商界中还不够平衡、普遍和深入，有些地方的工商界还没有发动捐献运动，有些地方虽已发动，但是爱国捐献的宣传教育工作还没有深入到每家每户，因此捐献的成绩还不够显著。因此，和其他各界人民一样，工商界的爱国捐献运动还必须继续加强。各地工商联在这个工作中，应当负起主要的领导责任。
    为着继续推进工商界的爱国捐献运动，首先必须进行充分的时事宣传和爱国教育。目前时事宣传的重点，是要使工商界同胞一致认识在目前形势下继续加强爱国捐献运动的必要。而为了使工商界同胞人人都认识捐献武器对于支援前线、巩固国防的意义以及工商界本身应当积极参加这个运动的道理，必须继续在工商界中进行深入的爱国主义教育。
    其次要注意的是，工商界的捐献运动必须在增加生产、改善经营和减少浪费的方针下进行，并根据这种方针来修订爱国公约；在订立爱国公约时，应将增产捐献列为公约的主要内容之一。根据北京以及其他城市工商界订捐献计划的经验，这种计划，应由劳资双方协商订立，以便保证其实现，并借以加强劳资团结。为了鼓励职工的生产或营业积极性，新增加的收入应该提出一部分作为超额奖励金发给职工。
    最后，为了高度发扬工商界的爱国积极性，各地工商联可以鼓励工商户与工商户、行业与行业间展开爱国增产捐献竞赛，并订出适当的奖励办法。天津和杭州等地工商联已决定以锦旗或光荣榜来奖励捐献成绩优异的行业或工商户，这种作法值得各地参考。
