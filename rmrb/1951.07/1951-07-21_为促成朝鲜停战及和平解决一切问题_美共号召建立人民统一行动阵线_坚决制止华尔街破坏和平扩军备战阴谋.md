Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th (TASS): The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States has issued a statement calling on progressive groups, trade unions, and peace advocates to intensify their efforts to gain broad support from the American people and jointly strive for the conclusion of a Korean armistice agreement and the peaceful resolution of all other issues. The National Committee's statement said:

　　The armistice negotiations are a new and significant step in the struggle for peace. This negotiation is a defeat for the imperialist forces that wanted to conquer Korea and expand the war to China. This negotiation reflects the increasing difficulties that Wall Street imperialism has encountered in its plan to launch a war and seize world hegemony, and it also reflects its inability to contain the increasingly strong national liberation struggles of colonial peoples around the world.

　　The resulting predicament of the Korean War, coupled with the strength of the growing peace movement in our country and around the world, has forced the US government and the governments of its satellite states to adopt the proposal of Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, to begin Korean armistice negotiations. However, this victory won by the forces of the people defending peace has not changed the basic policy of US imperialism in the slightest. Its policy remains to establish world hegemony and prepare to launch a third world war. Therefore, no one should think that a "ceasefire" agreement guarantees peace.

　　American military representatives, the State Department, and newspapers are constantly creating provocations; every provocation could become an excuse to finally stop the negotiations and restart military operations on a broader and more dangerous scale. The first such provocation to stop negotiations over a trivial excuse should be a warning: the State Department and American generals are playing a reckless gamble with universal peace. Only the representatives of North Korea and China, unwilling to let minor issues hinder their desire to achieve a peaceful resolution, have prevented the breakdown of the armistice negotiations. There is no doubt that if the American people do not rise up to intervene, do not stop the stalling of the military representatives acting on the instructions of Washington and Wall Street, and do not stop their attempts to sabotage the armistice negotiations, they will in the future raise excuses to sabotage the negotiations or bring them to a complete halt.

　　The people should also make it clear to the Truman government that they cannot tolerate endlessly dragging on and arguing while continuing to destroy human lives. The people will not allow delays in immediately signing an armistice agreement and then discussing the peaceful resolution of various issues as soon as possible.

　　Although the victorious conclusion of an armistice agreement does not eliminate the most serious danger of war, nor does it make Wall Street's war plans in Europe or Asia impossible, it is, after all, a great victory for the cause of peace. This would shatter the theory that war is inevitable. This theory is one of the main ideological weapons in the arsenal of the likes of Truman and MacArthur, who, despite their strategic and partisan differences, are in step in carrying out war plans and are unwilling to achieve a complete peaceful resolution in Korea or anywhere else.

　　In the current situation, the movement for peace has a great possibility of proposing new initiatives. The American people should demand that the Truman government withdraw troops from Korea and Taiwan, support China's attendance at the United Nations, and hold negotiations on concluding a five-power peace pact and resolving all disputes.

　　In addition, the American people should also expose the Truman government's propaganda about the "danger of peace"; the Truman government is adopting this method to conceal its own continued frenzied war preparations, but at the same time, it is militarizing and fascistizing our country, attacking the working class and black people, attacking the rights guaranteed to all Americans by the Constitution, further lowering the people's living standards and harming the people's economic well-being; while military profits are rapidly increasing, reaching unimaginable levels.

　　The American people are not afraid of any "danger of peace." They are only afraid of the danger of war and all the consequences of a war economy. Our progressive forces, especially the labor movement, should lead the struggle to abolish all war measures taken in the past year under the cover of artificially incited hysteria, and make these demands: cancel the current "state of emergency" that gives the government dictatorial wartime powers; restore all social measures appropriations that have been canceled due to the expansion of armaments; end the plan to levy heavy war taxes on the people; stop freezing wages and restore prices to previous levels; abolish universal conscription, stop persecuting black people, and stop provoking them; restore the Bill of Rights, abolish the Smith-McCarran Act, abolish the bans on communists, progressives, and peace advocates, and stop persecuting them; reconsider the Supreme Court's June 4th ruling and release the political prisoners imprisoned because of this ruling.

　　At present, the initiatives and actions of the labor movement and the peace movement to unite the broadest strata of the American people to support the demand for concluding an armistice agreement and for the peaceful resolution of all other disputes are the most decisive. A united front of the broadest kind, supporting this demand and opposing the measures to establish a war economy, opposing the fascist trampling of the Bill of Rights, is extremely necessary and possible to establish. If the American people rise up to intervene at this decisive moment and clearly voice their voices, this struggle can be expanded infinitely.

### 为促成朝鲜停战及和平解决一切问题  美共号召建立人民统一行动阵线  坚决制止华尔街破坏和平扩军备战阴谋

　　为促成朝鲜停战及和平解决一切问题
    美共号召建立人民统一行动阵线
    坚决制止华尔街破坏和平扩军备战阴谋
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：美国共产党全国委员会发表声明，号召进步团体、工会与和平拥护者加紧努力，以取得美国人民的广泛支持，为缔结朝鲜停战协定与和平解决其他一切问题而共同奋斗。全国委员会的声明说：
    停火谈判是争取和平的斗争中新的重大步骤。这个谈判是要征服朝鲜并要把战争扩大到中国的帝国主义力量的失败。这个谈判反映了华尔街帝国主义在其发动战争、夺取世界霸权的计划中碰到的困难越来越多，同时也反映了它无力遏止全世界各国殖民地人民越来越强的民族解放斗争。
    因此产生的朝鲜战争的绝境，连同我国与全世界日益壮大的和平运动的力量，使得美国政府及其附庸国家的政府不得不采纳苏联驻联合国代表马立克所提出的关于开始朝鲜停火谈判的建议。但是保卫和平的人民力量获得的这个胜利，丝毫也没有改变美帝国主义的基本政策。它的政策仍然是在建立世界霸权与准备发动第三次世界大战。因此，谁也不应该认为“停火”协定保障得了和平。
    美国的军事代表们、国务院与报纸不断制造挑衅；每一个挑衅都可以成为最后地停止谈判、在更加广泛更加危险的规模上重新开始军事行动的借口。在微小的借口下停止谈判的第一个这种挑衅，应该是一个警告：国务院与美国的将领们正在拿普遍的和平玩轻率的赌博。只有北朝鲜与中国的代表才不愿意让次要问题有碍于他们达到和平解决的愿望，因此，才防止了停火谈判的破裂。毫无疑问，如果美国人民不起来干涉，不制止按照华盛顿与华尔街的指示行事的军事代表们的怠工，不制止他们破坏停战谈判的企图，他们将来还会要提出破坏谈判或者使谈判完全停止的借口的。
    人民还应该使杜鲁门政府明白，他们不能容忍在继续毁灭人命的情况下，无终止地拖延下去与争论不已。人民不容许在立即签署停战协定、然后尽速讨论和平解决各种问题上拖延时日。
    虽然胜利地缔结停火协定并非就消除了最严重的战争危险，并非就使华尔街在欧洲或者亚洲的战争计划不能实现，可是这毕竟是和平事业的巨大胜利。这就会粉碎战争不可避免论。这种理论是杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟之流的武库中的主要思想武器之一，他们之间虽然有战略上的分歧与党派的分歧，可是在执行战争计划方面的步调却是一致的，他们都不愿意在朝鲜或在任何其他地方获得彻底的和平解决。
    在目前的情势下，争取和平的运动有提出新倡议的很大的可能性。美国人民应该要求杜鲁门政府自朝鲜和台湾撤兵，赞成中国出席联合国、举行关于缔结五大国和平公约及解决一切纠纷的谈判。
    此外，美国人民还应该揭露杜鲁门政府关于“和平的危险”的宣传；杜鲁门政府采取这种办法是为了掩饰它自己要继续疯狂进行战争准备，但就在同时，它自己却在使我国军国主义化及法西斯化，对工人阶级及黑种人民进攻，对宪法给全体美国人规定的权利进攻，进一步降低人民的生活水平及损害人民的经济幸福；而军事利润却在急速增长，达到不可想像的程度。
    美国人民并不怕什么“和平的危险”。他们只怕战争的危险和战争经济的一切后果。我国的进步力量，特别是工人运动，应该领导斗争，争取废除一年来在人工煽动起来的歇斯底里掩盖下进行的一切战争措施，要提出这些要求：取消给政府以战时独裁全权的现行“紧急状态”；恢复已因扩充军备运动而取消了的一切社会措施拨款；结束向人民征课战争重税的计划；停止冻结工资，使物价恢复以前的水准；废除普遍兵役，停止迫害黑人，停止向他们挑衅；恢复权利法案，废除史密斯——麦卡伦法，废除对共产党、进步分子及和平拥护者的禁令，停止对他们的迫害；重新考虑最高法院六月四日的判决，释放因这项判决而被下狱的政治犯。
    目前，工人运动与和平运动为了团结最广大阶层的美国人民来支持关于缔结停战协定及关于和平解决一切其他纠纷的这个要求所作的倡议和行动，是最有决定性的。支持这个要求和反对建立战争经济的措施、反对法西斯主义蹂躏权利法案的、最广泛的统一的行动阵线，是极其必要的，而且是有可能建立的。如果美国人民在这个决定性的时期起来进行干涉，明明白白发出自己的呼声的话，这个斗争就可以无限加强地扩大起来。
