    Relying on the Masses and Investigation and Research, Difficulties Can Be Overcome – Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong’s Letter

    Editor:

    Regarding Comrade Chen Yougong's views on basic construction issues (see People's Daily, July 10th, second edition), I have the following opinions:

    I believe that many of the difficulties raised by Comrade Chen Yougong are possible and should be overcome through subjective effort.

    In the "Records of Visits with Model Workers" compiled by Xinhua Bookstore, I read about the deeds of model worker Li Fenglian. It introduces that Comrade Li Fenglian was a child bride in a landlord's family when she was young, and naturally had no opportunity to go to school. When Shenyang was liberated in 1948, the Party gave Comrade Li Fenglian a task, asking her to be a military representative (only with two guard platoons and one clerk) to take over a clothing factory with two to three thousand people. At that time, Comrade Li Fenglian had just come out of the mountains, and of course, she did not have rich experience in entering such a large city as a military representative. Comrade Li Fenglian's cultural level was very low, and she would not have learned any modern industrial management. At that time, the work attitude of the employees must have been much worse than it is now. However, Comrade Li Fenglian, with her wisdom, always maintained contact with the workers and stayed in the clothing factory for half a year, and all difficulties were overcome by her.

    However, Comrade Chen Yougong believes that: "Most of the leading cadres have not learned modern industrial management, and although the general technical personnel have undergone two years of education and transformation, their work attitude has not completely changed from bureaucratic enterprises, and their enthusiasm still needs to be further inspired," "Democratic management is only a formality," and "Transportation, labor organization, employee wages, etc., still have a series of difficulties and obstacles."

    The People's Daily's criticism of engineering design is precisely to attract the attention of leading cadres and to remind everyone to overcome difficulties. As I understand it, when a public construction company in Beijing was building a boiler room, before the boiler design drawings were even received, they subjectively estimated: "The boiler may weigh two tons?" So they started to lay the foundation and build the walls. When the boiler design came, the frame alone weighed five tons. Of course, the work that had already been done had to be stopped. Can it be said that such errors in relatively simple projects are caused by "leading cadres not knowing modern industrial management and technical personnel not being highly conscious"?

    Another time, when a large building was to be built, the design drawings were revised more than seventy times due to a lack of understanding of the detailed and complex situation in advance. The construction managers did not know what the building would look like when laying the foundation, how many floors it would have, and when the design drawings for the first floor came, they did not know what the second floor would be like. It was put together piece by piece like this. As a result, when it was completed, the shape of the entire building was completely different from the original design drawings, so they had to redraw a drawing based on the building that had already been built and submit it to the national construction management agency to deal with the matter.

    In addition, I believe that the losses caused in basic construction, in addition to the fact that some comrades have a hasty attitude towards basic construction, are also due to the existence of feudal foremen in the construction projects. Some private merchants collude with foremen to engage in improper behaviors such as cutting corners, deceiving owners, and exploiting workers; some leading cadres of public enterprises have the mistaken idea of relying on foremen to complete tasks, which promotes the arrogance of feudal foremen. For example, some workers in Beijing reported that when trade union members go to work on construction sites, they do not dare to admit that they are trade union members, otherwise they will be ostracized. Some construction trade union members call themselves "underground members." In such a situation, how can the enthusiasm and creativity of workers be brought into play? For example, when constructing on a construction site in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, the foundations of the base columns were not in a straight line, so the columns had to be moved and pieced together. On a construction site of a printing factory, the wall was built crooked several times and had to be rebuilt. If the workers had been mobilized, I believe such things would not have happened.

### 依靠群众调查研究困难是可以克服的——对陈有功同志的信的意见

    依靠群众调查研究困难是可以克服的——对陈有功同志的信的意见编辑同志：
    关于陈有功同志对基本建设问题的看法（见人民日报七月十日第二版），我有以下一些意见：
    陈有功同志所举出的许多困难，我认为是有可能也完全应该用主观努力克服的。
    在新华书店汇编的《劳动模范访问记》里，我看到劳动模范李凤莲同志的事迹。里面介绍：李凤莲同志，在小时候当过地主家的童养媳，上学校读书自然是没有她的份儿。在一九四八年沈阳解放的时候，党给李凤莲同志一个任务，叫她当军事代表（仅带两个警卫班和一个公务员）去接收一个两三千人的被服厂。当时李凤莲同志刚从山里出来，进这样大的城市当军事代表，当然不是有什么丰富经验的，李凤莲同志的文化水平很低，她也不会是学会了什么现代的工业管理。当时职工的劳动态度，一定比现在要差的多。可是李凤莲同志却凭着她的智慧，和工人群众始终保持联系，在被服厂呆了半年，一切困难被她战胜了。
    可是陈有功同志却认为：“领导干部之中，大部没有学会现代工业的管理，一般技术人员虽经二年教育改造，但是劳动态度并未从官僚企业完全转过来，积极性还待继续启发”“民主管理还只是形式”“交通运输、劳动组织，职工的工资等，还有着一系列的困难和阻碍”。
    人民日报对工程设计提出的批评，正是为了引起领导干部重视，正是为了提醒大家战胜困难。据我了解，北京某公营建筑公司在修建一个锅炉房时，在锅炉的设计图样还没拿到以前，就主观的估计：“锅炉可能有两吨？”于是就动手打地基，砌围墙。锅炉设计拿来了，光架子就有五吨重。当然已经做起来的就只好停工。像这样比较简单的工程，还出了差错，这能说是“领导干部不会现代的工业管理，技术人员觉悟不高”造成的吗？
    还有一次，要修建一座大楼，设计图样由于事先缺乏对细致复杂的情况的了解，前后修改了七十多次。管理施工的在打地基时不知道这楼是什么样子，有多少层，第一层的设计图样拿来了，不知道第二层是什么样。就这样一块一块拼凑起来。结果盖完了，整个楼的形状，和原先的设计图样完全两样，只好又按已筑成的楼从新画了一个图，呈报给国家的建筑管理机关，应付公事。
    另外，我认为在基本建设上所造成的损失，除因为有些同志对于基本建设采取草率从事的态度以外，那就是在建设工程中，还存在着封建把头的缘故。部分私商和把头勾结，进行偷工减料蒙骗业主及剥削工人等不正当行为；有些公营企业的领导干部有倚赖把头完成任务的错误思想，助长了封建把头的气焰。如北京市有些工人反映，工会会员去工地做工时，就不敢承认是工会会员，否则就要受到排挤。有些建筑工会会员把自己称做“地下会员”。在这样的情况下，怎样会发挥工人的积极性和创造性呢？如北京东郊某工地施工时，基柱的地基不在一条直线上，只好将柱子互相挪动挪动，凑合凑合。某印刷厂工地，砌墙时，砌歪了好几次，不得不返工重建。如果工人已发动起来的话，我相信这样的事是不会发生的。
