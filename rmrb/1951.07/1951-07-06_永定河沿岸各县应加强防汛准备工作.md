The counties along the Yongding River
    Should Strengthen Flood Prevention Preparations

To prevent flooding, the counties along the Yongding River carried out extensive spring repair projects this year and made some preparations for summer flood prevention. However, according to inspections in late June, there are still some problems in the flood prevention preparations of the counties along the river:

First, the flood workers, emergency teams, reserve teams, and grassroots flood prevention organizations have not been seriously prepared. For example, in Tianjin's Fourth District, sixteen flood workers are needed, but according to an inspection on June 26, only two have been identified. Some villages believe that "there is no need to prepare, when the time comes, men, women, old and young will go to the dike together." The most serious thing is that when individual villages organized emergency teams, they did not raise their vigilance and organized some politically suspicious elements into them.

Second, the preparation of materials for dike construction is also very insufficient. For example, the establishment of flood sheds, except for Anci County where preparations are better, the flood sheds in Wuqing have been erected, but they are extremely weak and cannot withstand storms. And most of the flood sheds are unguarded. Some of the flood prevention materials have been prepared, but they are not up to standard, or they are "unknown in quantity," and they have not been transported to the construction section.

The basic reason for the above situation is that the county and district leading cadres have not done enough publicity and education to the masses, and have not solved the difficulties in the work of village cadres. In order to correct the above deviations and strive for victory in flood prevention, the following work must be carried out quickly:

First, carry out a patriotic propaganda movement for flood prevention and dike protection, so that the masses can realize the importance and political significance of flood prevention and dike protection work along the Yongding River for protecting agricultural production along the river, protecting the Beijing-Tianjin transportation, and ensuring the safety of the two major cities of Beijing and Tianjin. The masses can be awakened by recalling the disaster situation last year. On this basis, mobilize the masses to formulate patriotic pacts for flood prevention and dike protection.

Second, conduct thorough inspection work, including inspections of dikes, materials, organizations, transportation, etc., and solve problems in a timely manner. Flood prevention training courses should also be held, so that each member of the masses can learn various techniques for flood prevention and emergency rescue through the trained backbone members.

Third, conscientiously implement the "special responsibility system." Help village cadres carry out scientific division of labor in the work of taxation, flood prevention, pest control, etc. Divide the dike section into defense areas and defense sections, and assign special personnel to manage them. It is also necessary to emphasize mutual support and unified mobilization. (Liu Hao, Wang Ce)

### 永定河沿岸各县应加强防汛准备工作

　　永定河沿岸各县
    应加强防汛准备工作
    永定河沿岸各县为防止水患，今年曾进行了庞大的春修工程；对夏防也作了一定程度的准备。但据六月下旬检查，发现沿河各县的防汛准备工作还存在若干问题：
    首先是汛工、抢险队、后备队及防汛基层组织还没有认真准备好。如天津四区需要十六个汛工，据六月二十六日检查，只确定了二人。有的村则认为“不用准备，到时候男女老少一齐上堤。”最严重的是有个别村在组织抢险队时，没有提高警惕，把一些在政治上可疑的分子也组织进来。
    其次，堤防建设物料的准备也很不够。如汛铺的建立，除安次县准备较好外，武清的汛铺虽已架设，但极不巩固，经不起暴风雨的袭击。且汛铺大部无人看守。防汛物料有的虽已准备，但不够标准，或者是“心中无数”，并且未运至工段。
    产生上述情况的基本原因是县区领导干部对群众宣传教育不够，没有很好地解决村干部工作中的困难。为了纠正上述偏向，争取防汛胜利，目前必须迅速进行以下工作：
    第一、开展防汛护堤的爱国主义宣传运动，使群众认识到永定河沿岸的防汛护堤工作，对保卫沿河的农业生产、保卫京津交通以及保证京津两大城市安全的重要性和政治意义。可用回忆去年灾情的办法提高群众觉悟。在此基础上发动群众制订防汛护堤爱国公约。
    第二、深入开展检查工作，包括堤防、物料、组织、交通等方面的检查，发现问题及时解决。并应召开防汛训练班，通过受训的骨干分子，使每个群众都学会防汛抢险的各种技术。
    第三、认真贯彻“专责制”。在征收、防汛、除虫等工作上帮助村干部进行科学分工。在堤段上要划分防区防段，确定专人专管。还要强调相互支援，统一调动。（刘浩、王策）
