　　Destroying the Enemy in the Air
    A Record of a Battle by the Korean People's Air Force
    On June 22nd, after receiving the task of "reconnoitering the movements of enemy ships intruding into our coastline," Li Bingqi immediately led three planes, breaking through the morning mist-covered sky towards his destination.

    Upon reaching the airspace above × Sea, more than twenty enemy planes were suddenly discovered about one kilometer ahead and above.

    "Enemy planes sighted! Attack!" After signaling to his wingmen, Comrade Li Bingqi charged straight towards the enemy formation.

    The enemy squadron, caught off guard by the unexpected and fierce attack of our eagles, appeared very panicked. They immediately dispersed in all directions and began to descend hastily.

    Li Bingqi caught sight of an enemy plane attacking him from below, flashed down from the enemy plane's left, and fired fiercely.

    In an instant, the enemy plane spurted out two streams of black smoke and began to flee. Li Bingqi pursued closely and continued to attack. The repeatedly hit enemy plane turned into a ball of fire and fell into the deep blue sea.

    Gripping the control stick tightly, infinite courage and strength surged into Li Bingqi's heart. With the determination to crush the enemy planes, he attacked an enemy plane challenging him from the right; the panicked enemy plane desperately flew downwards.

    Li Bingqi pursued the enemy plane closely, calmly spraying angry cannon fire at it.

    The hit enemy plane immediately fell into the sea with a trail of black smoke.

    At this moment, Li Bingqi raised the nose of his plane and calmly and forcefully lifted it into the sky. When he flew up to eight hundred meters, four enemy planes pounced on his plane from all directions. In order to occupy a favorable position, Li Bingqi turned the nose of his plane upwards, and at that moment, Park Je-doo's plane and Zhang Yonghua's plane swooped down from the left and right simultaneously, overwhelming the enemy planes trying to attack Li Bingqi's plane from the left and right, and fired at them. Two enemy planes immediately turned into balls of fire and fell into the sea.

    Li Bingqi continued to pursue, and the remaining enemy planes, panic-stricken, hurriedly scattered and fled southwards.

    In the fifteen-minute air battle, Li Bingqi and his wingmen bravely fought against enemy planes that outnumbered them five to one, creating a record of him personally shooting down two enemy fighters, and Park Je-doo and Zhang Yonghua each shooting down one enemy plane.

    Li Bingqi's heroic achievements have made him a combat model in the Korean People's Air Force. The Supreme People's Committee of Korea, in recognition of his merits, has awarded him the Third Class National Flag Order.

　　在空中歼敌
    记朝鲜人民空军的一次战斗
    六月二十二日，李炳七接到“侦察侵入我海岸线的敌人舰艇动态”的任务后，便即刻率领了三架飞机，突破笼罩着晨雾的天空向目的地飞去。
    在到达×海上空时，在正前方约一公里上空处忽然发现二十多架敌机。
    “发现敌机！进行攻击！”向友机发出信号后，李炳七同志便向敌机群直冲过去。
    受到我们雄鹰意外的猛烈攻击的敌机队显得十分惊慌，它们立即向各方分散，并开始仓促下降。
    李炳七捕捉住从下面向他攻击的一架敌机，闪光似地从敌机左边俯冲下去，并猛烈地加以射击。
    刹那间，敌机喷出两条黑烟开始逃跑，李炳七紧追不舍，并继续加以攻击。被连续击中的敌机变成了一个火团，跌入了蓝色的深海里。
    紧紧地握住操纵杆，李炳七的心头涌上了无限的勇气和力量。他以坚决粉碎敌机的决心，又向从右边向他挑战的敌机加以攻击；惊慌的敌机死命地往下飞去。
    李炳七紧追着敌机，沉着地以愤怒的炮火向敌机喷射。
    中了弹的敌机立即带着一股黑烟跌落到海里去了。
    李炳七这时把机首一昂，沉着用力地把飞机升到上空。当他飞上八百公尺时，四架敌机从四面向他的飞机扑过来。李炳七为了占据有利的位置，把机首向上一转，而就在这一瞬间，朴济斗的飞机和张永化的飞机从左右同时俯冲下来，压倒似地掠过要从左右挟击李炳七机的敌机，并加以射击。敌机两架即刻变成一团火球，落入海里去了。
    李炳七继续追击，而失魂落魄的其余的敌机，匆忙地向南方逃散。
    在十五分钟的空战中，李炳七和他的友机与数量上多了五倍的敌机进行了勇敢的搏斗，并创造了他个人击落敌战斗机两架，朴济斗和张永化各击落敌机一架的战绩。
    李炳七的英雄业绩已使他成为朝鲜人民空军中的战斗模范。朝鲜最高人民委员会为表扬他的功绩，特授给他以三级国旗勋章。
