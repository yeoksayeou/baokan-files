　　The Music of the Film "The Life of Wu Xun" Should Also Be Criticized
    He Shide
    In the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," attention should also be actively paid to the film's music. Because film music is a part of film creation, it unconsciously guides and infects the audience through the music. Its influence is by no means smaller than the script.
    The entire music of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is centered on praising Wu Xun, who deceived the people, exploited the people, and served as a slave to the feudal ruling class for his entire life, which is completely in line with the film's theme. At the beginning of the film, the theme song praising Wu Xun appears. The orchestra plays so-called "solemn and firm" musical phrases; the theme song uses soprano to sing long "ah" sounds praising Wu Xun's so-called "noble qualities;" at the same time, men and women sing in chorus the praises of "one bag and one bowl, journeying tirelessly, one brick and one tile, accumulating into gold." When a close-up of Wu Xun appears in front of the white clouds in the sky, the loud singing praises "Great is Wu Xun, most courageous and benevolent, begging for education, unique throughout the ages," just as the directors and composers call it "singing loudly into the clouds." Next, the slow, symmetrical, church-like chimes—dong—dong—accompany the voice of a female teacher with a revolutionary face, gently preaching. This is a charming beginning carefully arranged by the directors, screenwriters and composers.
    In the grand ceremony in front of the archway, amidst the loud and exaggerated sounds of suonas, gongs, and drums, the yellow jacket bestowed upon Wu Xun was put on him. This music deliberately conceals the ugly appearance of the corrupt and reactionary imperial court of the late Qing Dynasty towards its slave Wu Xun, while exaggerating the so-called "imperial grace" of the magnificent occasion.
    Does the composer praise the soldiers of the Taiping Army in the same way as they praise Wu Xun? Obviously not. What music does the composer use when the character of Zhou Da appears in the film? When Zhao Xiong, the running dog of Zhang Ju-ren, and others beat Wu Xun half to death, and Zhou Da angrily, resolutely, and selflessly rushes to rescue Wu Xun, and Zhou Da fiercely fights with Zhao Xiong, the composer uses noisy drum sounds and Western-style fighting music to stimulate the audience's ears, without separating the enemy from ourselves, and without giving Zhou Da a majestic and powerful tune. Later, just as Wu Xun is putting on the yellow jacket, Zhou Da leads his companions to attack the bully landlord Zhang Ju-ren's house. At this time, the sound effects used in the film appear even more chaotic and terrifying, depicting the revolutionary actions of the Taiping Army soldiers as murderous, arsonous, and unruly bandit behavior. Why not use powerful, upright, Chinese-style music to express the armed peasants' anger and punishment towards the landlords? Why not sing the praises of the armed peasants' firm will, courageous actions, and the victory of the struggle? This fully reflects that the directors and composers intentionally elevate Wu Xun while insulting the peasant revolution.
    In addition, in the film's scenes promoting superstition, such as sleepwalking in hell and ascending to heaven in a dream, the music almost completely imitates the techniques of American monster movies, going to extremes in its monstrous terror and elusive etherealness.
    Undoubtedly, the music of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has already played an extremely bad role. This is because, in the collaboration process between the directors, screenwriters and composers, the composer not only executed the intentions of the directors and screenwriters, but also sincerely praised Wu Xun in his own thoughts.
    I believe that the composer must also examine the bad influence that his created music has had on the masses. This is just like poisonous popular songs that endanger the people! If the criticism of music is relaxed, then it will be difficult for music composers to progress. In the past, film music has not received much criticism, and film critics often humbly say that they do not understand music, so they put film music aside. In fact, film music is not mysterious and intangible. Truly people's film music is not only understood and happily accepted by the people; but it will also become a powerful weapon in the people's lives and revolutionary struggles. Comrade Nie Er's film songs "March of the Volunteers" and "The Road Song" are vivid examples. We must resolutely oppose film music that deliberately mystifies and poisons the people. Only the combination of strict and active criticism and the composer's self-criticism can improve the composer's ideological level and clarify the influence of bourgeois reactionary thought in film music.

### 电影《武训传》的音乐同样应受批评

　　电影《武训传》的音乐同样应受批评
    何士德
    在对电影《武训传》的批判中，对于电影音乐的批评也应该积极加以注意。因为电影音乐是电影创作的一部分，它使观众在不知不觉中受了音乐的引导与感染。它的影响决不比剧本为小。
    武训传影片的全部音乐，都是以歌颂欺骗人民、剥削人民、为封建统治阶级做了一辈子奴才的武训为中心，这是与这个影片的主题思想完全吻合的。影片一开始就出现了歌颂武训的主题歌。管弦乐队奏着所谓“庄严而坚定”的乐句；主题歌以女高音唱着“啊”的长音歌颂着武训的所谓“崇高的品质”；同时又男唱女和地唱着“一囊一钵，仆仆风尘，一砖一瓦，累积成金。”的颂词。当武训的特写镜头，在天空白云前面出现的时候，嘹亮的歌声正如编导者所谓“高唱入云”地赞美着“大哉武训，至勇至仁，行乞兴学，千古一人。”接着，缓慢的匀称的教堂式的钟声当—当—地陪伴着装着革命面孔的女教师温和说教的声音。这些就是编导者与作曲者精心布置的一个迷人的开端。
    在牌坊前面的加恩大典中，在唢呐锣鼓大吹大擂的礼乐声中，赐给武训的黄马褂加上了身。这段音乐故意遮盖了清末腐败反动的皇朝对其奴才武训的丑相，而夸扬了所谓“皇恩浩荡”的显赫盛况。
    作曲者对于太平军的战士是否也和对于武训一样地加以赞颂呢？显然不是。在影片上的周大这个人物出现的时候，作曲者用的是什么音乐呢？当张举人的走狗赵熊等把武训吊打得半死，周大愤怒地坚决地奋不顾身地冲过去抢救武训，周大与赵熊激烈地搏斗的时候，作曲者以噪杂的鼓声、西洋风的打架音乐，以刺激观众的耳朵，而没有把敌我分开，没有给周大以雄壮有力的曲调。以后，正当武训黄马褂加身的时候，周大领着伙伴们去打击恶霸地主张举人家，这时影片所用的音响效果更显得十分紊乱而恐怖，把太平军战士们的革命行动描写成杀人放火胡作乱为的强盗行为。为什么不以有力的正派的中国风格的音乐来表现武装农民对地主的愤怒与惩罚呢？为什么不歌颂武装农民的坚强意志，勇敢的行动与斗争的胜利呢？这充分地反映了编导者与作曲者是有意提高武训而侮辱农民革命的。
    此外，电影中宣传迷信的梦游地狱和梦上天堂的几个场面，音乐几乎完全模仿了美国神怪电影的手法，极尽其神怪恐怖与变幻缥缈的能事。
    无可怀疑的，电影武训传的音乐已经起了极坏的作用。这是由于编导者和作曲者在合作过程中，作曲者不但执行了编导者的意图，而且在自己的思想上对武训也是衷心赞颂的原故。
    我认为作曲者对于他所创作的乐曲，在群众中所起的坏影响也必须检讨。这和有毒素的流行歌曲一样是危害人民的！如果放松了对音乐的批评，那末音乐作曲者就难于进步了。过去，电影音乐就没有受到什么批评，写影评的常常谦虚地说不懂音乐，于是就把电影音乐放在一边。其实电影音乐并不是神秘不可捉摸的，真正的人民电影音乐，人民不但听得懂，乐于接受；而且会成为人民的生活和革命斗争的一种有力的武器。聂耳同志的电影歌曲《义勇军进行曲》《大路歌》等就是个鲜明的例子。对于故弄玄虚和毒害人民的电影音乐，我们就必须坚决反对它。只有严格的积极的批评与作曲者的自我批评结合起来，才能提高作曲者的思想水平，才能澄清电影音乐中的资产阶级反动思想影响。
