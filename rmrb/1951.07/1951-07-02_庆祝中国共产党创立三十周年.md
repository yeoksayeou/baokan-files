　　Celebrating the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
    Bao Erhan
    On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, I would like to express my feelings with incomparable joy to celebrate this great anniversary. In the course of this thirty-year struggle, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the liberation struggle of all ethnic groups in China has achieved a great historical victory, overthrown the reactionary Kuomintang regime, broken away from the oppression of imperialism headed by US imperialism, and realized the great People's Republic of China of independence, freedom and unity. In other words, it brought to an end the feudal system that had ruled for thousands of years, the imperialism that had been oppressing for 110 years, and the comprador class of imperialism for 30 years—the oppression of bureaucratic capitalism.
    Achieving such a great victory in world history is no ordinary matter. Nearly half a billion people have achieved their own liberation, established a new democratic people's democratic dictatorship, and are marching towards a bright future under the leadership of a new type of proletarian party. This is also promoting the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, enhancing the infinite strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and at the same time giving a fatal blow to the vampire imperialist camp headed by US imperialism, which attempts to launch a war.
    How and with what was such a great victory achieved? History and the experience of China's struggle over the past forty years tell us and clearly prove that without the leadership of a correct and strong party representing the interests of the broad masses of working people and fighting for the liberation of the broad masses of people, no revolution can be victorious.
    Therefore, today's victory is fundamentally due to the existence of the Communist Party of China, built on the real theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and the great leader of this party, Chairman Mao Zedong. Because the Communist Party of China is a correct, strong and powerful revolutionary party that can represent the interests of the broad masses of working people, it can closely connect with the masses, serve the people wholeheartedly, be conscientious and responsible to the broad masses of people, adhere to truth and justice, extensively carry out criticism and self-criticism, promptly correct mistakes, actively grasp democratic centralism, strictly abide by discipline, and realize the organization of a unified and strong party. In short: because there is a correct, strong and powerful proletarian party and its leader, the great founder Chairman Mao, and also because of the success of the great Soviet socialist construction and the crushing of German, Italian and Japanese fascism in the Second World War. These are the basic factors for the victory of the Chinese people's liberation revolution.
    The greatness of Comrade Mao Zedong and his ability to become a great leader of the people is because he completely determined the nature, object, future and strategy of the Chinese revolution in accordance with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and combined the views and laws of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin with the specific environment of China in the experience of the Chinese revolution, and further promoted it. In the Chinese revolutionary struggle, he carried out irreconcilable struggles with the speculators in the party, making the Communist Party of China a sound, stable and unified party. These are all concrete proofs of Comrade Mao Zedong's wisdom and greatness.
    All the minority ethnic groups in China who were oppressed, despised, excluded, and treated unfairly under the rule of the reactionary regime in the past have now, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, gained equal rights and become members of the big family of the People's Republic of China with full equal rights. Now they are joining hands with the people of all ethnic groups to undertake the glorious task of building a new China in accordance with the Common Program. In the thousands of years of Chinese history, such unity, friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups as today is unprecedented. The peaceful liberation of Tibet and its return to the big family of the People's Republic of China is a vivid proof of this.
    In terms of national issues, our great leader Chairman Mao applied and carried forward the theories and laws of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on colonial and national issues, linking national issues with the issue of overthrowing imperialism, establishing new democracy, and advancing towards socialism. In all of Chairman Mao's theoretical works, we see that he further developed the internationalist world view of the proletarian revolution of Lenin and Stalin. Therefore, the rich experience of the Communist Party of China, with its thirty-year history, is a bright beacon and model for the liberation cause of the nations of the East.
    As we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China today, I respectfully wish it new victories day by day. And I hope that all the people of all ethnic groups in our country will further consolidate unity, be friendly and cooperative, and closely unite around the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, in order to successfully complete the new construction cause of the new happy People's Republic of China, extensively carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, support the Korean people in winning the final victory as soon as possible, and strive to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible.

　　庆祝中国共产党创立三十周年
    鲍尔汉
    在中国共产党成立三十周年的时候，我以无比的欢欣，略述自己的感想，用以庆祝这个伟大的纪念日。在这个三十年的斗争过程中，中华各族人民的解放斗争，在中国共产党领导下，获得了历史性的伟大胜利，推翻了国民党反动政权，脱离了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的压迫，实现了独立自由统一的伟大中华人民共和国。换句话说就是，使几千年来实行统治的封建主义制度，和一百一十年以来进行压迫的帝国主义，以及帝国主义三十年以来的买办阶级——官僚资本主义的压迫宣告结束。
    获得这样在世界历史上的伟大胜利，不是一件平凡的事情。将近五亿人民取得了自己的解放，建立了新民主主义的人民民主专政的国家，在新式的无产阶级政党的领导下，朝着光明前途迈进。这也是发扬了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，增强了以伟大苏联为首的和平民主阵营的无限的力量，同时也就是给以予美帝国主义为首的企图发动战争的侵略者吸血鬼帝国主义阵营以致命的打击。
    这样大的胜利是怎样和用什么得来的？历史和中国近四十年来的斗争经验告诉我们，并极明显地证明了：如果没有代表广大劳苦群众利益为广大人民解放事业而斗争的正确而坚强的一个政党的领导，那么任何革命是不可能胜利的。
    因此，今天的胜利基本上是由于有了建筑于马列主义的真实理论基础上的中国共产党及这个党的伟大领袖毛泽东主席才得来的。因为中国共产党是能代表广大劳动人民利益的正确强有力的革命的党，它能密切地联系群众，全心全意为人民服务，在广大人民面前认真负责坚持真理正义，广泛展开批评和自我批评，及时纠正错误，并且积极掌握民主集中制，严格遵守纪律，实现了统一而坚强的一个政党的组织。总而言之：由于有了一个无产阶级的正确坚强有力的政党，及其领袖伟大的创始者毛主席，也由于伟大苏联社会主义建设的成功和第二次世界大战中粉碎了德、意、日法西斯主义。这些都是中国人民解放革命所以能够获得胜利的基本因素。
    毛泽东同志的伟大和能够成为人民伟大领袖，就是因为他把中国革命的性质、对象、前途及这革命的策略，完全按照马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说去断定，并且在中国革命的经验上把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的观点、规律，和中国的具体环境结合起来，更加发扬了它，在中国革命斗争中，和党内的投机分子，进行不调和的斗争，使中国共产党成为一个健全稳固统一的党。这都是毛泽东同志的英明伟大的具体明证。
    中国境内过去在反动政权统治下被压迫、蔑视、排斥、遭受不平对待的所有的各少数民族，今天已经在中国共产党及伟大领袖毛主席领导下获得了平等权利，成为中华人民共和国大家庭内享有充分平等权利的一员，现在正和各族人民共同携起手来，依照共同纲领，肩负起建设新中国的光荣任务。在中国几千年的历史上，像今天各民族这样的团结友爱合作，是有史以来所未有的。现在西藏和平解放，回到中华人民共和国大家庭里来，这就是一个生动的证明。
    在民族问题方面，我们的伟大领袖毛主席运用和发扬了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林等关于殖民地民族问题的理论和规律，是把民族问题和推翻帝国主义建立新民主主义向社会主义迈进的问题联系起来的。我们在毛主席所有的理论著作里面看到，他更加发挥了列宁、斯大林无产阶级革命的国际主义的世界观。因此，拥有三十年历史的中国共产党的丰富的经验，是东方各民族的解放事业的光明的灯塔和模范。
    在我们庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年的今天，我敬祝它一天比一天获得新的胜利。并希望我们国内所有的各民族人民更加巩固团结，友爱合作，紧密地团结在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的周围，为胜利完成新的幸福的中华人民共和国新的建设事业，广泛开展抗美援朝运动，支援朝鲜人民早日取得最后胜利，争取早日解放台湾。
