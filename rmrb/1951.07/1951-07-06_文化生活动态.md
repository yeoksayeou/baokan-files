New Yi Language Textbooks Published Continuously
The teaching experiment of the Yi phonetic writing system in Xikang Province is progressing very rapidly. The personnel responsible for the design of the Yi language and the teaching experiment have decided to use the new writing system to compile and print a complete set of textbooks and extracurricular reading materials for the first grade of Yi primary schools by the end of July, a total of six types. The first volume of the language textbook was published on April 7th, and it has now been decided to reprint it due to actual needs. The ethnic policy, the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army, the National Anthem, The East is Red, Singing of Chairman Mao, and the second volume of the language textbook have been translated, compiled, and reviewed, and were published on June 7th. The first and second volumes of the Yi elementary school arithmetic textbook have also been compiled and are currently being printed. In addition, the personnel responsible for the design of the Yi language and the teaching experiment have also decided to strive to compile and print a collection of revolutionary songs and learning materials such as policies and regulations before the end of July. After all these books are published, they will begin to compile a Yi-Chinese dictionary based on the instructions of the Academy of Sciences on the new writing system plan and the experience summarized over the past six months. The problem of teachers for Yi primary schools can also be initially resolved by the end of August. In mid-May, the Xichang Prefectural Nationalities Cadre School, in response to the requirements of the Yi people, sent six Yi students with better grades to the garrison in Zhaojue and the ethnic primary schools in Puge and Daliangshan Lamp Factory to teach the new writing system. Currently, nearly a thousand people in Xichang Prefecture are learning the new writing system. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国科学院实验生物研究所昆虫研究会，鉴于小麦吸浆虫在苏北、皖北为害严重，而江南一带尚无此项报告：特于六月初组织三个调查小组分赴苏南、皖南及浙江各地调查。结果发现南京、镇江、无锡、上海、芜湖、宁国、嘉兴、金华等地都有小麦吸浆虫为害。上海近郊小麦受害的百分比，以麦穗计算为三九·六六至九一；以麦粒计算为一·一至六·一。此次调查结果证明小麦吸浆虫的为害，不只限于华北，江南受害地区也已相当辽阔。
