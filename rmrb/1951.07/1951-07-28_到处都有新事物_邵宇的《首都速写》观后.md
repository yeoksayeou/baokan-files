　　New Things Are Everywhere
  　——After Viewing Shao Yu's "Sketches of the Capital"
To the Editor:
    I very much admire Comrade Shao Yu's paintings. From "Shangrao Concentration Camp" to "Thousands of Mountains and Rivers" (the former published in the People's Daily; the latter in the "New Observer" magazine), they all have his unique style. The "Sketches of the Capital" recently serialized in the People's Daily, in particular, impressed me with its novelty and intimacy.
    Among the ten "Sketches of the Capital" already published, "Orphanage" and "What I Saw in a Compound" are especially moving. Before liberation, just like in other places, the orphanages in Beijing were also "hells" where imperialism strangled and harmed our country's children. The images of happy and joyful children in Comrade Shao Yu's paintings cannot but increase our hatred for imperialism and our love for the great motherland. Similarly, before liberation, the compounds in Beijing were often the breeding grounds for poverty and disease. Comrade Shao Yu's sketches vividly tell us that under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao, the compounds in Beijing have undergone fundamental new changes – everyone is working together in harmony and establishing patriotic pacts.
    Comrade Shao Yu uses simple brushstrokes to vividly depict the various new things in the people's capital. This gives me a great inspiration: New things are everywhere!
    Why do some authors keep writing the same old things? Why are some works often "the face of the petty bourgeoisie, wearing the clothes of workers, peasants, and soldiers"? The era of complaining about "objective conditions" and "having no place to use one's talent" is over. Let our literary and art workers strive to improve their level of political theory, maintain political sensitivity to new things, and express more new things!

### 到处都有新事物——邵宇的《首都速写》观后

　　到处都有新事物
  　——邵宇的《首都速写》观后编辑同志：
    我十分喜爱邵宇同志的画，从《上饶集中营》到《千山万水》（前者在人民日报发表；后者在《新观察》杂志发表），都有他的特殊风格。最近在人民日报连载的《首都速写》，尤其使我感到新颖和亲切。
    在已经发表的十幅《首都速写》画中，《育婴堂》和《大杂院里所见》这两幅画，尤其使我感动。在解放前，正和其他各地一样，北京有的育婴堂也是帝国主义扼杀残害我国儿童的“地狱”。通过邵宇同志笔下的幸福愉快的儿童群像，就不能不使人增加对帝国主义的仇恨和对伟大祖国的热爱。同样，在解放前，北京的大杂院往往是贫困、疾病的渊薮，邵宇同志的速写画却用生动的形象告诉我们：在伟大的毛主席领导下，北京的大杂院已经起了根本的新变化——大家和衷共济，订立爱国公约了。
    邵宇同志用朴素的笔法，生动地描绘出人民首都的各种各样新鲜事物，这件事情，给我以很大的启示：到处都有新事物！
    为什么有些作者写着老一套的东西呢？为什么有些作品往往是“小资产阶级的面孔，披着工农兵的外衣”呢？埋怨“客观条件”、“英雄无用武之地”的时代已经过去了，让我们的文艺工作者努力提高自己的政治理论水平，保持对新鲜事物的政治敏感，多多表现新鲜事物吧！
