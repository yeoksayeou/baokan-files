Vetting of Funds Requires Ideological Struggle

　　Vetting the funds of enterprises (including fixed assets and working capital) is the prerequisite for the planned operation of the socialist economy and the first step in implementing the economic accounting system. Our state-owned enterprises must implement an economic accounting system, that is, independent operation of enterprises under the centralized guidance of national planning; otherwise, we will not be able to accumulate funds for industrial construction in enterprises, learn new experiences in operating enterprises, and cultivate new-style enterprise management cadres, and therefore it will be impossible to achieve industrialization. Only by implementing the economic accounting system can we, as stated in the State Council's "Decision on State-Owned Industrial Production and Construction in 1951," "promote the initiative of enterprise management, increase labor productivity, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, eliminate waste, and increase national accumulation to ensure the expanded reproduction of industry and improve the material and cultural living standards of workers." Without the decisive step of vetting funds, the implementation of the economic accounting system is impossible.

　　The funds of our state-owned enterprises have mostly not been vetted. Therefore, the state cannot understand the potential capacity of the fixed assets (production equipment) and working capital of state-owned enterprises; in managing enterprises and formulating economic construction plans, it lacks a correct basis. At present, the utilization rate of production equipment in state-owned enterprises is still very low. For example, coal mining equipment, machinery and power generation equipment, flour manufacturing equipment, etc., have not fully exerted their effectiveness. In terms of working capital, there are also situations of inflexible turnover and blind stockpiling. This means that we still have a considerable amount of fixed and working capital that has not actually participated in the production process and is being idle and wasted. Taking Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant as an example, before the vetting of funds in April this year, 54 percent of the working capital was actually wasted. After the vetting of funds and the withdrawal of 54 percent of the original working capital, the plant's working capital still turned over smoothly. This means that before the vetting of funds, this enterprise actually used the working capital of two enterprises of the same scale. What a serious waste of funds this is!

　　Why haven't the funds of our state-owned enterprises been vetted? This is because the most important source of our state-owned enterprises is the former bureaucratic enterprises. The operators of these enterprises were engaged in commercial speculation for a long time and neglected the development of production and economic accounting; therefore, the waste of funds in these enterprises is very serious. After we took over these enterprises, a small part has been vetted for funds and implemented the economic accounting system, while most of them, although there has been a fundamental change in the nature of the enterprise, becoming an enterprise serving the people, have not yet implemented the vetting of funds, and therefore cannot be said to implement economic accounting. Their management methods are not independent operation under the centralized guidance of national planning, but a supply system that relies entirely on state supplies. The supply system of enterprise management was once necessary during the war. But now, if we continue to use the supply system to manage state-owned enterprises, it will inevitably lead to all kinds of undue waste and become an obstacle to planned economy. We must change the management of all enterprises that are still implementing the supply system to economic accounting. The vetting of funds is the first necessary step in carrying out this fundamental reform.

　　Precisely because our state-owned enterprises have not vetted their funds in the past and have not implemented economic accounting, there is a fairly widespread conservative ideology among enterprise responsible cadres. According to existing experience, the more common ideological obstacles encountered in the process of vetting funds are the following three:

　　First, many people only pay attention to production, not management; only pay attention to completing production tasks, and not paying attention to completing financial plans. These people think that the basic problem in state-owned enterprises is production, and since state-owned enterprises do not need to compete with anyone and are not afraid of losing money, they can spend less effort on how to manage them, and if there are difficulties in management, the superiors will always solve them. Therefore, they are only enthusiastic about organizing production and launching labor competitions, but are indifferent to the vetting of funds and the work of clearing assets before that.

　　Second, many people take a departmentalist point of view when clearing assets. What they are most worried about is reducing the funds of their own unit. Some enterprise leaders are afraid that after the inventory, the superiors will take away the surplus assets, so they often do not carefully carry out the inventory and division of materials. They are very unwilling for the superiors to know the true state of his assets. After the clearing, when appraising, they often estimate the price of the assets that are decided to belong to the enterprise lower than the due price in order to "reduce costs" and obtain more "above-plan profits"; for the assets that should be handed over, they estimate the price higher than the due price, in order to get more funds and show off their achievements in handing over funds.

　　Third, many people have the idea of "being lenient in estimation and strict in use" when vetting working capital. This can be said to be a reflection of the peasants' idea of "preventing drought and preparing for famine" in enterprise management. Funds are vetted through the preparation of enterprise plans, and the basis of the plan is various quotas, such as raw material consumption and reserve quotas, finished product reserve quotas, wage and management fee quotas, and so on. If the quota is set high, more working capital is needed. Many enterprise leaders try their best to relax the quota in the preparation of various plans. They are afraid that there will not be enough funds in the future, which will delay production. Therefore, they would rather ask for more funds in order to be "prepared for contingencies."

　　In addition, some people who have long been accustomed to the past management methods of bureaucratic capital do not think it is strange that there is a backlog of funds in the enterprise, so they are not enthusiastic about the work of vetting funds.

　　People who hold the above ideas are actually opposed to vetting funds and opposed to economic accounting. Whether it is "only asking about production and not asking about management," "departmentalism," or "being lenient in estimation and strict in use," they are all starting from a partial point of view, trying to use a partial point of view to dominate the overall situation, and all violate the management principles of socialist state-owned enterprises. These erroneous ideas hinder the full utilization of national funds, the full exertion of enterprise potential, and the sound development of people's enterprises. Therefore, in order to successfully complete the task of vetting funds, we must wage a resolute struggle against these erroneous, conservative, unscientific, and anti-socialist ideas. The past experience of the Northeast region and some of the existing experience in Guannei (such as the experience of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant published in this newspaper today) have proved that this ideological struggle is inevitable.

　　We must implement a planned economy; therefore, we must implement an economic accounting system; therefore, we must vet funds. There is no room for wavering on this issue. We must launch an ideological struggle on this issue in order to completely defeat all erroneous and conservative ideas in enterprise management.

### 核定资金要展开思想斗争

　　核定资金要展开思想斗争
    核定企业的资金（包括固定资金和流动资金），是社会主义性质的国家经济实行有计划经营的前提，是实行经济核算制的经营方法的第一步。我们的国营企业必须实行经济核算制的经营，即在国家计划集中指导下的企业独立经营；否则，我们就不能在企业中积累工业建设的资金，就不能学会新的经营企业的经验，就不能培养成新式的企业经营干部，因而也就不可能实现工业化。只有实行了经济核算制度，才能像政务院《关于一九五一年国营工业生产建设的决定》中所说的：“发扬各企业经营的积极性，提高劳动生产率，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，消灭浪费与增加国家的积累，保证工业的扩大再生产与提高劳动者的物质生活及文化水平。”而如果没有经过核定资金这个决定性的步骤，经济核算制的实行是不可能的。
    我们的国营企业的资金，绝大部分没有经过核定。因此，国家就不可能了解国营企业的固定资金（生产设备）和流动资金的潜在能力；在管理企业和制定经济建设计划时，就缺乏正确的根据。目前国营企业的生产设备的利用率还是很小的，譬如采煤设备，机器和发电设备，面粉制造设备等等，都没有充分发挥效能。在流动资金方面，也存在着周转不灵与盲目积压的情况。这就是说，我们还有为数不小的固定的和流动的资金，实际上并未参加生产过程，而被闲置着，浪费着。以石景山钢铁厂为例，在今年四月核定资金以前，实际上即有流动资金的百分之五十四是被浪费的。在核定资金抽出了原有流动资金的百分之五十四以后，该厂在流动资金方面仍然周转自如。这就是说，在核定资金之前，这个企业在实际上是使用了两个同等规模的企业的流动资金。这是对于资金的如何严重的浪费啊！
    我们的国营企业的资金为什么没有经过核定呢？这是因为，目前我们的国营企业的最主要的来源，是过去的官僚企业。这些企业的经营者，过去长期从事商业投机，而忽视发展生产和经济核算；因此，这些企业中资金的浪费是很严重的。这些企业，在我们接管之后，一小部分已经经过核定资金，实行了经济核算制，而其中的大部分，虽然在企业性质上有了根本的改变，成了服务于人民的企业，却还没有实行核定资金，也就说不上实行经济核算。它们的经营方法，不是在国家计划集中指导下的独立经营，而是一切依赖国家供给的供给制度。供给制的企业经营，在战争时期曾经是必要的。但是在现在，如果继续用供给制的方法来经营国家企业，就必然造成种种不应有的浪费，必然成为计划经济的障碍。我们必须把一切尚在实行供给制的企业的经营，改变为经济核算制的经营。而核定资金就是进行这种根本改革的第一个必要的步骤。
    正因为我们的国营企业过去没有核定资金，没有实行经济核算制的经营，在企业负责干部中就有相当普遍的守旧思想。就已有的经验看来，在核定资金的过程中所遇到的比较普遍的思想障碍，有下列三种：
    第一，许多人只注意生产，不注意经营；只注意完成生产任务，而不注意完成财务计划。这些人以为，国营企业中的基本问题是生产，国营企业既不需要和谁竞争，又不怕亏本，因之如何经营，可以不多用心，万一经营上有困难时，上级总是会解决的。因此，他们只热心于组织生产和发动劳动竞赛，而对于核定资金以及在此之前的清理资产工作，却漠不关心。
    第二，许多人在清理资产时，采取本位主义的观点。他们最担心的是核减本单位的资金。有些企业负责人恐怕在清点之后，上级把多余的资产提走，因而往往不认真进行物资的清点和划分。他们很不愿上级知道他的资产的真实状况。在清理之后，在估价时，往往把决定属于该企业的资产的价格估得低于应有的价格，以图“降低成本”和获得较多的“超计划利润”；对于应该上缴的资产，则估得高于应有的价格，以图多得一些资金，并且炫耀自己交出资金的成绩。
    第三，许多人在核定流动资金时，有“宽打窄用”的思想。这可以说是农民“防旱备荒”的思想在企业经营上的反映。资金是经过编制企业计划来核定的，而计划的基础是各种定额，比如原材料消耗和储备定额，成品储备定额，工资及管理费用定额等等。定额定高了，需要的流动资金就多。许多企业负责人在编制各项计划中尽量争取放宽定额，他们惟恐将来资金不够，耽误生产，因之宁愿多要资金，以期“有备无患”。
    此外，还有些长期习惯于过去官僚资本经营方法的人，对于企业中的资金积压现象不以为怪，因而对于核定资金的工作也不热心。
    抱着以上这些思想的人，实际上是反对核定资金，反对经济核算的。无论“只问生产，不问经营”也好，“本位主义”也好，“宽打窄用”也好，都是从局部观点出发，企图用局部观点来支配全局，都违反社会主义性质的国家企业的经营原则。这些错误的思想，妨碍国家资金的充分利用，企业潜力的充分发挥，和人民企业的健全发展。因此，为了顺利地完成核定资金的任务，就不能不与这些错误的、守旧的、反科学的、反社会主义的思想作坚决的斗争。东北区过去的经验以及关内已有的一部分经验（例如今天本报发表的石景山钢铁厂的经验），都证明了这个思想斗争是不可避免的。
    我们一定要实行计划经济；因此我们一定要实行经济核算制；因此我们一定要核定资金。在这个问题上，没有动摇的余地。我们必须在这个问题上展开思想斗争，以彻底战胜企业经营中的一切错误的守旧的思想。
