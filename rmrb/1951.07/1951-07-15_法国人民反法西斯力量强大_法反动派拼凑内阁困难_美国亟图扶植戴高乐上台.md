　　French People's Anti-Fascist Forces are Strong
    French Reactionaries Find it Difficult to Cobble Together a Cabinet
    The United States is Eager to Support de Gaulle to Power
    [News from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The French reactionaries continue to be in serious chaos three weeks after the election. The new National Assembly elected on June 17 was established on the 5th and held its first meeting, but only dealt with some procedural formalities. The right-wing parties are still fighting behind the scenes and cannot find a way to put together forces to form a new government.
    The contradiction that the French reactionaries cannot resolve is: On the one hand, the American ruling group is determined to force the French fascist leader de Gaulle's "French People's League" into the new government; on the other hand, the French people's anti-fascist forces are so strong that it is difficult for the French reactionaries to publicly support de Gaulle and establish the right-wing majority necessary for them to "govern."
    In order for de Gaulle to be able to govern, the American imperialists have carried out many activities, the most important of which is that Truman's special adviser Harriman arrived in Paris on the third day after the French election. According to a report by the Telegraphic Communication Agency: Harriman's main purpose of this trip is to "influence the leaders of certain French political parties to agree to cooperate closely with de Gaulle's 'French People's League'. Harriman believes that the main positions in the new French government should be given to the 'French People's League'." At the same time, the reactionary American newspapers are also doing their best to promote de Gaulle. The New York "Herald Tribune" blatantly advocated that the "third force" parties should support de Gaulle. A reactionary article published in the "Daily Mirror" shamelessly stated: If de Gaulle came to power, he would "suppress the Communist Party and declare the Communist Party illegal. De Gaulle may stand on our side and become a strong pillar of the United States."
    With the support of the United States, de Gaulle himself has also been active everywhere. According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Paris on the 1st, de Gaulle has publicly announced that he "is unwilling to adhere to the consistent policies of the opposition party." At the same time, his "French People's League" National Committee also adopted a so-called "policy declaration" on the 1st, stating that it is willing to form a coalition government with any party organization without exception.
    De Gaulle's plan to take power has been supported by other French reactionaries, especially the "Independent Republican Peasant Alliance" of the so-called Fourth Force. The leader of the alliance, Renault, the notorious French surrender premier during World War II, publicly told Agence France-Presse reporters: "I hope that the 'French People's League' will join the majority in the future." The Radical Socialist Party also clamored that the new government must accommodate de Gaulle elements. The party's "Zhendan News" said: "A group that has won almost 21 percent of the votes cannot be prevented from participating in national ... work."
    The French Communist Party's "Humanity Daily" pointed out that this conspiracy to form a government and the French newspapers' movement to praise de Gaulle is "to create an excuse for Auriol so that he can openly prepare for the rise of France's future dictator." In fact, in this clamor, French President Auriol, when carrying out his cabinet formation activities, met with Bardou and Mehaier, de Gaulle elements who nominally pretended to be "independents" and socialists.
    However, although the American and French reactionaries are carrying out such rampant activities, they cannot overcome the opposition of the people. Therefore, the French reactionaries themselves feel hopeless about what kind of new government they can cobble together. De Gaulle recently admitted that he is not yet capable of forming a government. Soustelle, the Secretary-General of the "French People's League," also told Agence France-Presse reporters: "It is still difficult to say what kind of government there will be in the future." According to Agence France-Presse, the reactionary newspapers in Paris were still blindly admitting until the 7th: "How to form a new government is still a question."

　　法国人民反法西斯力量强大
    法反动派拼凑内阁困难
    美国亟图扶植戴高乐上台
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：法国反动派在大选举行已三周之后继续处在严重的混乱中。六月十七日选举出来的新国民议会已于五日成立，举行了首次会议，但是只处理了一些程序上的形式问题，各右翼党派对于如何拼凑力量以组织新政府的问题，仍然在幕后勾心斗角而找不到一个办法。
    法国反动派所无法解决的矛盾是：一方面，美国统治集团一心要把法国法西斯头子戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”硬塞进新政府去；另一方面，法国人民反法西斯的力量又如此强大，使得法国反动派很难公开把戴高乐捧上台来，为他们建立起“执政”所必需的右翼多数。
    为了要使戴高乐能够执政，美国帝国主义者已进行了许多活动，其中最重要的是：在法国大选后第三日，杜鲁门的特别顾问哈里曼就到了巴黎。据电通社报道：哈里曼此行的主要目的，就是要“影响某些法国政党的领袖，使他们答应和戴高乐的‘法兰西人民联盟’密切合作。哈里曼认为法国新政府中的主要位置应给与‘法兰西人民联盟’。”同时，美国的反动报纸也在竭力为戴高乐鼓吹。纽约“先驱论坛报”明目张胆地主张“第三种力量”各党应该支持戴高乐。“每日镜报”登出的一篇反动文章公然无耻地说：如果戴高乐当了权，他就会“镇压共产党，并且宣布共产党非法。戴高乐可能站在我们这一边，而成为美国有力的支柱”。
    在美国的支持下，戴高乐自己也四出活动。据法新社巴黎一日电透露，戴高乐已经公开宣布：他“不愿坚持在野党的一贯政策”。同时他的“法兰西人民联盟”全国委员会则又在一日通过了所谓“政策宣言”，声明愿意毫无例外地和任何党派组织联合政府。
    戴高乐的执政计划得到了法国其他反动派，首先是所谓第四种力量的“独立共和农民联盟”的支持，该盟领袖、第二次世界大战时臭名远扬的法国投降总理雷诺公开对法新社记者说：“我希望‘法兰西人民联盟’将来加入多数派。”激进社会党也大嚷新政府必须容纳戴高乐分子。该党的“震旦报”说：“一个几乎得到选票百分之二十一的集团，是不可能不让它参加国家……工作的”。
    法共“人道报”指出：这种筹组政府的阴谋和法国报纸大捧戴高乐的运动，是“为阿里奥尔制造借口，使他可以公开准备法国将来的独裁者上台。”实际上，在这种叫嚷声中，法国总统阿里奥尔在进行组阁活动时，曾接见了名义上假充是“独立分子”和社会党人的戴高乐分子巴杜和麦依埃。
    但是，美、法反动派虽然这样肆行活动，却不能克服人民的反对，因此，法国反动派自己对于能拼凑出一个什么样的新政府来的问题，都感到渺茫。戴高乐最近承认他现在还没有能力组织政府。“法兰西人民联盟”总书记苏斯戴尔也曾向法新社记者表示：“现在还很难说将来会有怎样的一个政府。”据法新社透露，巴黎各反动报纸直至七日依然只好茫然承认：“怎样组织新政府仍然是个疑问”。
