　　The Battle of Pakdal Peak
　　Shi Feng, Guo Zhenwen
    Pakdal Peak is located more than sixty miles southwest of Kimhwa. Its terrain is steep and covered with dense forest. It is a necessary passage for the enemy to risk invading Kimhwa. From May 30th to June 4th, 1951, for six days and six nights, the heroes of a certain battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers repelled more than forty attacks by the U.S. invading army's 25th Infantry Division, annihilated more than 1,340 enemies with very few casualties, shot down two enemy planes, and destroyed one enemy tank.
    Two companies of the U.S. invading army's 25th Division arrived at the foot of Pakdal Peak as early as May 28th, but they were timid and dared not move forward. On the 29th, they conducted a tentative bombardment of Pakdal Peak. Only at dawn on the 30th, under the cover of intense artillery fire, aircraft, and tanks, did they begin to invade Pakdal Peak, but they were immediately met with strong resistance from the Volunteer soldiers.
    The soldiers calmly guarded the fortified positions, waiting for an opportunity to strike the enemy. When an enemy scout platoon advanced to within thirty meters of the fortifications, a signal sounded, and dozens of Volunteer fighters rushed out of the fortifications, throwing volleys of grenades at the enemy. Dozens of bayonets then pressed close to the enemy's chests. The enemy's scout platoon was quickly wiped out. Subsequently, the enemy infantry, under the supervision of their officers, launched four more consecutive attacks, but each time they were crushed by the heroic Volunteer soldiers.
    In the battle, the Volunteer infantrymen hidden in the fortifications concentrated all their firepower on the more than 300 enemies behind the tanks, and automatically pointed out targets for the artillery in the rear. The foremost enemy tank was set ablaze by artillery fire, and the remaining five tanks turned around and fled. The enemy infantry lost the cover of the tanks and were unable to raise their heads under the concentrated fire of the Volunteers. On this day, the soldiers killed more than 150 enemies in total; they themselves only suffered one death and two minor injuries. The next day, although the enemy organized eight more attacks, they all failed as before.
    On the third day of the battle, the enemy vainly attempted to seize the Volunteer's position by relying on even more intense artillery fire. From 3:00 AM, they concentrated artillery of various calibers, and with the cooperation of aircraft, conducted continuous bombardment for nine hours. Dense artillery shells and bombs poured down on the ridge of Pakdal Peak, which was only a little over two miles long. But the fearless Volunteer soldiers bravely and unyieldingly held their ground, repelling many enemy charges amidst the smoke and fire. When the enemy launched another fierce attack in three directions, Guo Xinnian, the communist party member and company commander of the 7th Company, although half of his jaw was blown off and he was unconscious many times, still struggled to rally himself to continue commanding the battle, and threw more than thirty grenades at the approaching enemy, so that his right-hand fingers were wrapped with grenade pull rings. Deputy Instructor Liu Han also disregarded his serious shoulder and head injuries, and continued to throw seven grenades at the enemy. In the minute before his heroic sacrifice, he still shouted to his comrades, "Defend the motherland, liberate Korea, defend world peace..." Nineteen-year-old Miao soldier Liu Xingwen was so moved that he shed tears, and also shouted loudly, "Defending the motherland is defending Chairman Mao, is defending the people of the whole country, is defending our Miao family!" He fiercely picked up a box of grenades and ran to the side of Liang Heting, the machine gunner who was sweeping the enemy. At this time, Liang Heting was suddenly wounded, and the enemy took the opportunity to pounce forward. Liu Xingwen then threw grenades violently. As the smoke and dust rose, the enemies fell one after another. Zhao Jinping, the ammunition handler who had awakened from his serious injuries, saw Liu Xingwen's brave behavior, forgot his own injuries, grabbed the machine gun, and fired fiercely at the enemy. Liu Xingwen crawled next to him and pointed out the targets for firing. As they were knocking down piles of enemies, a bullet flew over and Zhao Jinping's right arm was wounded again. But he endured the pain of the second injury and continued to strike the enemy with his bleeding right hand. Every time Zhao Jinping finished firing a magazine of machine gun bullets, Liu Xingwen would continuously throw grenades, covering Zhao Jinping to reload the bullets. The two of them took turns from noon until dark, repelling eleven enemy charges. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, with more than fifty bodies abandoned alone.
    In the last two days, the enemy commander, who had suffered repeated defeats, became even more frantic. They concentrated all the aircraft, artillery, and tanks they could muster in the battlefield, exhausted all attack methods, and impatiently drove the soldiers, who had been frightened out of their wits, to attack the mountain ridge where there was no road. The Volunteer soldiers met them head-on with counterattacks. Communist Party member Chai Yunzhen led all the soldiers in his squad to charge out, using submachine guns to blast a path of counterattack, directly reaching the enemy's position. He quickly knocked out two enemy battalion command post bunkers, and the enemy battalion commander was killed in the bunker. The enemy, who had lost their command, were in chaos. The enemies who were lucky enough to survive threw their guns on the ground, covered their heads with both hands, cried loudly, and crawled back in a hurry. At this time, another enemy officer was driving up the soldiers who were prepared for the second attack. They ran right into those who were running backwards, so all the enemies were jammed in a mountain ditch, in a chaotic mass like maggots. At this time, under the slogan of "Strike hard, avenge the sacrificed comrades!", the Volunteer soldiers concentrated all kinds of firepower on the hilltop and swept fiercely at this group of routed enemies. Chai Yunzhen's submachine gun broke down, so he immediately picked up the enemy's carbine to sweep. When the bullets ran out, he threw grenades at the enemy. He alone killed and wounded nearly a hundred enemies. Under such heroic attacks by the Volunteer soldiers, the enemies completely collapsed, and fled the majestic Pakdal Peak in panic, like wild beasts seeing hunters.
    For a full six days and six nights, the soldiers of this heroic battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers completed their combat mission and created the glorious achievement of annihilating more than 1,340 enemies.

　　朴达峰阻击战
　　石峰、郭振文
    朴达峰在金化西南六十多里，山势陡峭，林木茂密，是敌人冒险进犯金化必经之地。中国人民志愿军某营的英雄们从五月三十日到六月四日的六天六夜中，曾经在这里击退了美国侵略军步兵第二十五师的四十多次进攻，并且以极少的伤亡歼灭了一千三百四十多名敌人，击伤敌机两架，击毁敌人坦克一辆。
    美国侵略军第二十五师的两个连，虽在五月二十八日就到了朴达峰的山脚下，却畏首畏尾，不敢前进。他们在二十九日对朴达峰进行了试探性的轰击，到三十日拂晓才在猛烈的炮火和飞机、坦克的掩护下，开始向朴达峰进犯，但马上就遇到了志愿军勇士们的坚强阻击。
    勇士们沉着地守卫在筑有强固工事的阵地上，待机打击敌人。当敌人的一个尖兵排进到离工事只有三十公尺的时候，一声号响，几十个志愿军战士一齐从工事里冲出去，成排的手榴弹掷向敌人，几十把刺刀接着就逼近了敌人的胸膛。敌人的尖兵排迅速被消灭了。接着敌人步兵在军官的督战下又连续发动了四次攻击，然而每一次都被英勇的志愿军战士们粉碎了。
    在作战中，藏在工事里的志愿军步兵们集中所有火力向着坦克后面的三百多个敌人猛烈射击，并且自动给后边的炮兵指点目标。敌人最前边的一辆坦克被炮弹打得烧起来，其余的五辆坦克回头就跑。敌人的步兵失去了坦克的掩护，被志愿军的集中火力打得抬不起头来。这一天勇士们一共打死了一百五十多个敌人；而自己只有一个人牺牲，两个人负了轻伤。第二天敌人虽然又组织了八次攻击，但都和前一天一样失败了。
    阻击战的第三天，敌人妄想依靠更猛烈的炮火来夺取志愿军的阵地。他们从清晨三时起，集中了各种口径的炮，在飞机配合下连续进行了九小时的轰击。密集的炮弹和炸弹倾泻到只有两里多长的朴达峰的山脊上。但无畏的志愿军勇士们英勇不屈地坚守着阵地，在硝烟烈火中打退了敌人许多次冲锋。当敌人分成三路又猛攻上来的时候，七连连长共产党员郭新年，虽然下颚被炸掉了一半，昏迷了多次，还竭力振作起来继续指挥战斗，并且对迫近的敌人投掷了三十多颗手榴弹，以致他的右手手指上缠满了手榴弹的拉火弦。副指导员刘汉也不顾自己肩上头上的重伤，继续向敌人打了七颗手榴弹。他在英勇牺牲前的一分钟，还向战友们喊着“保卫祖国，解放朝鲜，保卫世界和平……。”十九岁的苗族战士刘兴文激动得流着眼泪，也高声地喊道：“保卫祖国就是保卫毛主席，就是保卫全国人民，就是保卫我们苗家！”他狠狠地抱起一箱手榴弹，跑到正在扫射敌人的机枪射手梁和庭跟前。这时梁和庭突然负伤，敌人趁机猛扑上来，刘兴文就猛抛手榴弹，烟尘起处，敌人纷纷倒地。负了重伤苏醒过来的弹药手赵金平，看见刘兴文的勇敢行为，忘掉了自己的伤，抓住机枪朝敌人猛打。刘兴文就爬在他的近旁指点射击目标。他们正在把敌人成堆地击倒的时候，一颗子弹飞来，赵金平的右胳膊又负了伤，但他忍住了第二次负伤的痛苦，用着流血的右手继续打击敌人。赵金平每打完一梭机枪子弹，刘兴文就连续地抛手榴弹，掩护赵金平上子弹。他们两人轮番从中午一直坚持到天黑，打退了敌人十一次冲锋。敌人死伤重大，光是遗弃的尸体就有五十多具。
    最后两天，连吃败仗的敌人指挥官变得更疯狂了。他们集中了一个战地所能集中的所有飞机大炮和坦克，用尽了一切攻击办法，暴躁地赶着被打得胆战心惊的士兵向着没有路的山梁进攻。志愿军的勇士们就迎头予以反击。共产党员柴云振带着全班战士猛冲出去，用冲锋枪打出了一条反击道路，直达敌人阵地，很快打掉了敌人营指挥所的两个地堡，敌人的营长被打死在地堡里。失去了指挥的敌人乱成一团。侥幸活着的敌人将枪丢在地上，双手抱头，大声哭叫，滚着爬着地向后逃跑。这时另一个敌人军官正把准备用作第二次攻击的士兵驱赶上来，他们和那些往后跑的正好碰上，于是敌人就全部拥塞在一道山沟里，像蛆虫一样地乱成一团。志愿军勇士们这时在“出劲打呀，为牺牲同志报仇！”的口号下，集中了山头上各种火力，一齐向着这批溃乱的敌人猛烈扫射。柴云振的冲锋枪打坏了，立刻拾起敌人的卡宾枪来扫射，子弹打完了就向敌人抛手榴弹，只他一个人就打死打伤了近一百个敌人。在志愿军勇士们这样英勇打击下，敌人全部崩溃了，像野兽见到猎人一样惊慌地逃离了这个雄伟的朴达峰。
    整整六天六夜，志愿军这个英雄营的勇士们，完成了战斗任务，创造了歼敌一千三百四十多名的光辉战绩。
