　　How to Conduct Propaganda Rich in Political Content
　  ——Notes on the Propaganda Work of the 14th Workshop of a Factory in Shenyang During the Quality Inspection Campaign
　　Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    During this quality inspection campaign, the Party propagandists of a factory in Shenyang created many lively and vivid methods of political mobilization, imbuing the campaign with rich political content, thereby ensuring the success of the campaign.
  Using "Labor Protection Evening Gatherings" to Conduct Ideological Mobilization
    In order to do a good job in the propaganda work of the quality inspection campaign, the Party organization of the 14th Workshop convened meetings of the Party branch committee, propagandists, and activists to discuss many ways to do this work well, one of which was to hold labor protection evening gatherings. At the labor protection evening gatherings, three elderly workers were invited to tell about their personal experiences of life in the two eras. Worker Dong Yuqiao said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, once my foot was crushed by a machine and I couldn't work, but no one cared, and leave was simply not allowed. Later, my fellow workers carried me to work." Now Dong Yuqiao lives in a workers' sanatorium and enjoys labor insurance benefits, which Dong Yuqiao never dreamed of. Therefore, Dong Yuqiao said to everyone: "Today, I have nothing else to say, only to use improving product quality and resolutely eliminating defective products to respond to the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the workers."
    After the reports of the three veteran workers, the Party seized the opportunity to mobilize the staff and workers, calling on everyone to think about the past, compare it with the present, and respond to the call of the veteran workers. Then, group discussions were held. Everyone unanimously proposed: to protect their happy life, they must respond to the call of the three veteran masters, resolutely improve product quality, and eliminate defective products. The result of this evening gathering was very good, generally inspiring the workers' determination to improve quality and eliminate defective products, laying the ideological foundation for the development of the quality inspection campaign.
  Cadres Set an Example by Making Self-Criticisms, Making All Staff and Workers Pay Attention to Quality Inspection Work
    Next, the Party suggested that the administration convene a general mobilization meeting for quality inspection in the entire workshop. Yu Kemin, the director of the workshop, reviewed his own erroneous understanding of quality issues at the meeting. He said: "I am a workshop director, but I myself have an incorrect understanding of quality issues. In the past, I always felt that our workshop was doing 'rough work,' and if the work was ruined, it could be repaired again. Therefore, I didn't pay much attention to the quality of the products." Finally, the meeting also conveyed the instructions of Wang Heshou, Minister of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department, on carrying out quality inspection, criticizing the "getting by" mentality. And it was explained that inspecting product quality is beneficial to both the public and the private. Because quality improves, technology must improve; if technology improves, wages also improve.
    The cadres' exemplary self-criticisms and ideological mobilization made the staff and workers of the entire workshop have a clearer understanding of quality inspection.
  "Public Trial Platform for Defective Products"
    Gu Baoyuan, the secretary of the workshop branch, convened a meeting of activists after the mobilization meeting to solicit their opinions on quality inspection. Huo Shifan suggested: "For counter-revolutionary elements, there must be suppression and public trials. How about holding a public trial for defective products, this kind of bad guys?" So Gu Baoyuan immediately convened a meeting of propagandists to study Huo Shifan's suggestion. Everyone believed that this suggestion was very good, and the public trial platform for defective products was a very good method of political mobilization. The propagandists immediately began this work. The public trial platform for defective products was set up in the center of the yard, with eye-catching slogans written on red paper on both sides: "Improve Product Quality" and "Resolutely Eliminate Defective Products." Various defective products were displayed on the table inside the platform, with cards attached explaining the causes of the defective products. Vivid and lively blackboards and cartoons with political content, as well as other propaganda materials, were used for explanation.
    At the same time, propagandists and activists mobilized in various groups to calculate detailed accounts, and the results were published on the blackboard of the public trial platform. The total loss for five and a half months was 133.2 million yuan.
    This amount of loss can be used to buy one hundred and twenty-eight new bicycles, or one hundred and thirty-two thousand and two hundred catties of rice. This aroused the vigilance of all staff and workers.
  "Airplane Dedication Platform"
    The 14th Workshop has five production teams, and due to the large number of tasks, there is a danger that they will not be able to complete the tasks on schedule. For this reason, the Party convened a meeting of propaganda team members and studied a method of political mobilization that was closely integrated with the current political tasks—establishing an airplane dedication platform. This is to draw a large airplane with cardboard, divided into five pieces, with each team receiving one piece. The production progress of the team should be written on it. After the production task is completed, the piece of paper will be returned to the dedication platform. Only when all five teams have completed the production task can the airplane be reassembled. Before the establishment of the dedication platform, each team conducted deliberation. On the 21st, as soon as the dedication platform was established, each team scrambled to receive the piece of paper. In this way, Team ×× first completed the task on the 25th and sent a wing of the airplane back to the dedication platform. On the 26th, Team ×× also completed the task, and another wing of the airplane was also sent back to the dedication platform. The other three teams also completed the task on the 27th, completing the production task an average of three days ahead of schedule.
    The reason why this airplane dedication platform had such a powerful mobilizing effect is because it combined the current political task—the increase production and donation movement—and brought into play the workers' high patriotic enthusiasm.
  Oral Mobilization and Brief Reports
    In addition to visual propaganda mobilization during this campaign, oral mobilization and brief reports also achieved significant results. Propagandist Ren Fengxiang mobilized everyone in the work section, saying: "If the work we do is defective, it is better not to do it, because this wastes the country's property and cannot support the front lines." He also said: "The reason for defective products is that we are not focused on our work and have a 'good enough' mentality." Then, Ren Fengxiang launched everyone to discuss the issue of quality. During the discussion, everyone exposed twenty-seven kinds of problems on the products and found out the causes of the problems and solutions. As a result, twenty-six of the twenty-seven kinds of problems were solved at once, with only one remaining that needed to be solved jointly with the leadership.
    At the same time, the propagandist reported the progress of the quality inspection work to the workers every morning, such as how many defective products that group had eliminated and what problems had been solved. Everyone called it "reporting good news."
    The main reasons why the 14th Workshop did a good job in propaganda work are:
    (1) Every technical mobilization in production has rich political content. In their propaganda, questions are often raised like this: How can we meet the requirements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea? What are the losses to the country and the people if defective products are produced? ... so that the workers understand that every action they take is related to the interests of the motherland and the people. Therefore, the process of quality improvement in the 14th Workshop is not only a process of improving workers' skills, but also a process of improving workers' political awareness.
    (2) The propaganda forms are novel, vivid, and lively. This is the result of the propagandists, activists, and the masses giving play to their initiative and creativity. In the course of the movement, they created many politically significant methods of mobilization.
    (3) But the most important thing is that the Party paid attention to ideological leadership, so all the propagandists and all the staff and workers had full political enthusiasm.

### 怎样进行政治内容丰富的宣传——记沈阳某工厂十四车间在质量检查运动中的宣传工作

　　怎样进行政治内容丰富的宣传
　  ——记沈阳某工厂十四车间在质量检查运动中的宣传工作
　　中共沈阳市委会宣传部
    沈阳某工厂的党的宣传员，在这一次质量检查运动中，创造了许多生动活泼的政治鼓动方式，使运动具有了丰富的政治内容，并因而保证了这一运动的成功。
  通过“劳保晚会”，进行思想动员
    十四车间的党组织为了作好质量检查运动中的宣传工作，曾召开了党的支部委员会、宣传员会议、以及积极分子会议，讨论作好这一工作的许多办法，其中一项就是召开劳保晚会。劳保晚会上，请三个老年工人讲述他们亲身经历的两个时代的生活。工人董玉乔说：“在国民党反动统治时期，有一次我的脚被机器压坏了不能作工，但没有人管，请假根本不准许。以后工人兄弟架着我上了班。”现在董玉乔住上了工人业余疗养所，享受了劳保待遇，这真是董玉乔做梦也没想到的。所以董玉乔向大家说：“今天没有别的话可说，只有用提高产品质量、坚决消灭废品，来回答共产党和人民政府对工人的爱护。”
    三个老工人报告后，党就抓紧时机向职工进行动员，号召大家想过去，比现在，响应老工友的号召。接着又分组进行讨论。大家一致提出：要保卫自己的幸福生活，就得响应三位老师傅的号召，坚决提高产品质量消灭废品。这次晚会结果很好，普遍启发了工人提高质量消灭废品的决心，为质量大检查运动的开展奠定了思想基础。
  干部作示范检讨，使全体职工重视质量检查工作
    接着，党建议行政上召开了全车间的质量检查动员大会。车间主任于克敏在会上检讨了自己对质量问题的错误认识。他说：“我是个车间主任，可是我自己对质量问题就存在着不正确的认识。我过去总觉得我们这个车间是‘毛胚活’，活干废了还能够再修。因此我就不太重视产品的质量。”最后会上又传达了东北人民政府工业部王鹤寿部长关于开展质量检查的指示，批评了“过关思想”。并说明检查产品质量是与公与私都有好处的。因为质量提高，就必需技术提高；技术提高了，工资也提高了。
    干部的示范检讨及思想动员，使全车间的职工，对质量检查有了更明确的认识。
  “废品公审台”
    车间支部书记谷宝元，在动员大会后又召开积极分子会议，征求他们对质量检查的意见。霍世范建议：“对反革命分子，要镇压和公审，对于废品这种坏家伙，也来开个公审会，好不好？”于是谷宝元马上召开宣传员会议，研究霍世范的建议。大家认为这个建议很好，废品公审台是一个很好的政治鼓动方式。宣传员立即开始了这一工作。废品公审台是设在场房的中央，两边用红纸写着醒目的大字标语：“提高产品质量”、“坚决消灭废品”。台内桌上陈列各种废品，并附卡片说明产生废品的原因。再用生动活泼有政治内容的黑板报和漫画，及其他宣传品加以说明。
    与此同时，宣传员和积极分子们在各组发动了算细帐，并将结果在公审台的黑板报上公布。五个半月的损失共计一亿三千三百二十万元。
    这笔损失的款子计算起来能买一百二十八辆新自行车，或能买十三万二千二百斤大米。这就引起了全体职工的警惕。
  “飞机献礼台”
    十四车间有五个生产小组，因任务较多，有不能按期完成任务的危险。党为此召开了宣传员小组会，研究出一个与目前政治任务紧密结合的政治鼓动方法——建立飞机献礼台。这就是用硬纸画一个大飞机，分成五块，每一个小组领一块。上面要写上该组的生产进度。等生产任务完成后，就把这纸块交回献礼台去。只有五个组都完成生产任务，飞机才能重凑起来，在献礼台建立前，各组都进行了酝酿。二十一日，献礼台刚建立起来，各组都争先恐后的去领纸块。就这样××组在二十五日首先完成了任务，把一个飞机翅膀送回了献礼台。二十六日××组也完成了任务，另一个飞机翅膀也送回了献礼台。其他三个组也都在二十七日完成了任务，平均提前三天完成生产任务。
    这个飞机献礼台所以发生了这样有力的鼓动作用，就因为它结合了当前的政治任务——增产捐献运动，发挥了工人高度的爱国主义热情。
  口头鼓动与简短报告
    这次运动中除形象的宣传鼓动外，口头鼓动与简短报告也收到了显著的效果。宣传员任凤祥在工段里鼓动大家说：“咱们做出来的活，如果是废品，还不如不做，因为这样既浪费了国家的财产，又不能支援前线。”又说：“出废品的原因，就是咱们做活不专心，存有差不多的思想。”接着任凤祥就发动大家展开对质量问题的讨论。讨论中大家揭发出二十七种产品上的毛病，并找出产生毛病的原因与解决的办法。结果二十七种毛病一下就解决了二十六种，仅剩一种需要与领导上共同来解决。
    同时宣传员又在每天早上向工人报告质量检查工作进展的情况，如那组消灭了多少废品，解决了什么问题。大家叫它作“报喜”。
    十四车间做好宣传工作的主要原因是：
    （一）每件生产技术上的鼓动都有丰富的政治内容。在他们的宣传中，经常是这样提出问题的：怎样做才是符合抗美援朝的要求，出了废品，给国家给人民的损失怎样？……使工人们懂得了自己任何一个行动，都是关联到祖国与人民的利益。因此，十四车间质量提高的过程，不仅是工人技术提高的过程，而且是工人政治觉悟提高的过程。
    （二）宣传形式新颖、生动、活泼。这是由于宣传员、积极分子与群众发挥了积极性、创造性的结果。在运动的过程中，他们创造了很多有政治意义的鼓动方式。
    （三）但是最重要的是党注意了思想领导，因此全体宣传员、全体职工有了饱满的政治情绪。
