Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Washington dispatch: Simultaneously with the US and British governments publishing the draft of a separate peace treaty with Japan, the United States Information Service, the official news organ of the United States, released the so-called "Draft of the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty" on the 12th.

The so-called tripartite "Security Treaty" is a plan by the United States, imitating the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, to establish a Pacific aggressive bloc in the East under the guise of maintaining "peace" and "security." The United States attempts to use such a so-called "Security Treaty" to eliminate the doubts of Australia and New Zealand about the rearming of Japan by the United States, and to expand the aggressive forces of the United States in the Pacific region. The draft treaty itself fully exposes this point.

The draft binds Australia and New Zealand to the US chariot under the false pretense of "individual and collective resistance to armed attack" (Article 2). In order to drive Australia and New Zealand to act as its aggressive pawns, the United States stipulates in the draft treaty: "An armed attack on any of the contracting parties shall be deemed to include an armed attack on the metropolitan territory of any of the contracting parties or the island territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific, or its armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific." Each contracting party will "act in accordance with its constitutional procedures to meet the common danger."

The draft, modeled after the structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Council, stipulates that "the contracting parties shall establish a council composed of their foreign ministers or their assistants to consider matters relating to the implementation of this treaty."

According to a statement issued by US representative Dulles in Washington on the 12th, this tripartite "Security Treaty" is a "preliminary step" for the United States to establish a Pacific aggressive bloc. Dulles said that the United States hopes to take other steps at an appropriate time in order to "establish a broader regional security system in the Pacific region."

On the 12th, US representative Dulles, Australian Ambassador to the United States Spender, and New Zealand Ambassador to the United States Berendsen held a "preliminary signing" ceremony for this aggressive tripartite "Security Treaty Draft" at the US State Department. The United States plans to formally sign this "Trilateral Treaty" at the same time as signing a separate peace treaty with Japan in early September.

### 美在太平洋加紧扩张侵略  美澳新《安全条约草案》公布

　　美在太平洋加紧扩张侵略
　  美澳新《安全条约草案》公布
    【新华社十九日讯】华盛顿消息：与美、英两国政府发表单独对日和约草案的同时，美国官方新闻机关美国新闻处在十二日发表了所谓《澳大利亚、新西兰、美国三国安全条约草案》。
    所谓三国《安全条约》，是美国模仿侵略的北大西洋公约，在保持“和平”与“安全”的伪装下，在东方建立太平洋侵略集团的一个计划。美国企图用这样一个所谓《安全条约》，消除澳、新两国对美国重新武装日本所引起的疑虑，并在太平洋地区扩张美国的侵略势力。条约草案本身就充分暴露了这一点。
    草案是在“单独及集体的抵抗武装攻击”（第二条）的虚伪借口之下把澳大利亚和新西兰缚在美国战车上。美国为了驱策澳、新两国充当其侵略走卒，在条约草案中规定：“对缔约国任何一国的武装进攻，得认为包括对缔约国任何一国的本土或它在太平洋上所管辖的岛屿领土，或它在太平洋上的武装部队、公共船只或飞机的武装进攻。”每一缔约国将“按照它的宪法程序采取行动应付共同的危险。”
    草案仿照北大西洋公约理事会的机构，规定“缔约国成立一个由它们外交部长或其助理组成的理事会，考虑有关实施本条约的事宜”。
    按照美国代表杜勒斯十二日在华盛顿发表的声明，这个三国《安全条约》是美国建立太平洋侵略集团的“初步步骤”。杜勒斯说，美国希望在适当的时期中采取其他步骤，以便“在太平洋地区建立一个更广泛的区域安全体系的目的”。
    十二日，美国代表杜勒斯，澳大利亚驻美大使斯宾德和新西兰驻美大使比林德森，在美国国务院举行了这一侵略性的三国《安全条约草案》的“初步签字”的仪式。美国计划在九月初与签订单独对日和约同时，正式签订这个“三国条约”。
