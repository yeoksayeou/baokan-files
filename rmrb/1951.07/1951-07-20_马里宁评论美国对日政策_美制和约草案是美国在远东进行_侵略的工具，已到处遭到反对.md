Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: Malinin discussed the U.S. policy toward Japan in an international commentary published in *Pravda* on the 15th. Malinin pointed out that the desire to launch global aggression is the foundation of U.S. policy in Europe and the Far East. West Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia have been designated as the main fortresses for U.S. imperialism to carry out aggression.

The so-called draft peace treaty with Japan proposed by the U.S. government aims to turn Japan into a protectorate of Wall Street in the Far East. The draft treaty does not completely eliminate Japanese militarism, but instead places the main emphasis on a policy of encouraging Japanese militarism by all possible means. The peace treaty with Japan is not a guarantee of peace and security, but has been turned into a tool for U.S. aggression in the Far East. Turning Japan into an American firing range, cutting off part of its territory, enslaving the masses of people, suppressing the rising democratic public movement, and turning Japan back into the gendarme of Asia and a breeding ground for new wars in the Far East – these are the guiding plans of Wall Street's "overall strategy." After removing all the nice-sounding rhetoric, the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan signifies a close conspiracy between U.S. imperialism and its "new" partner – Japanese militarism.

Malinin asked: Can it be considered accidental that the publication of the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan coincided with the start of negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War? He replied: Of course not. The publication of this draft was deliberately intended to further exacerbate the international situation.

It is only natural that the U.S. draft has aroused negative attitudes everywhere. According to Reuters, *The London Observer* seriously believes that India may reject the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan. Reuters continued: India believes that a stable and genuine solution in the Far East is impossible without the participation of the government of the People's Republic of China. India believes that this draft treaty is intended to deepen the divide between the Soviet Union and Western countries.

In conclusion, Malinin emphasized that the powerful forces of peace defenders are constantly developing and consolidating. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, other people's democratic countries, and all freedom-loving people are unyieldingly struggling to achieve a peaceful resolution of post-war issues and to thwart the conspiracies of war instigators. The peace movement is developing day by day. The peace movement has stepped onto the historical stage to prevent war and ensure and consolidate world peace. It will carry its great and noble cause through to a victorious end.

　　马里宁评论美国对日政策
　　美制和约草案是美国在远东进行
　　侵略的工具，已到处遭到反对
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：马里宁十五日在《真理报》上发表的国际述评中，论述了美国的对日政策。马里宁指出：发动世界性侵略的愿望，是美国的欧洲和远东政策的基础。欧洲的西德和亚洲的日本，被指定充当主要堡垒，供美帝国主义用来进行侵略。
    美国政府提出的所谓对日和约草案，要把日本变为华尔街在远东的保护国。和约草案不是完全消灭日本军国主义，而是把主要重点放在以一切可能的办法鼓励日本军国主义的政策上。对日和约不是作为和平与安全的保证，而是被变为美国在远东进行侵略的工具。把日本变为美国的射击场，割去它的一部分领土，使人民群众从事奴隶劳动，镇压民主公众日益高涨的运动，把日本重新变为亚洲的宪兵，变为在远东发动新战争的温床——这些就是华尔街“总体战略”的主导计划。把一切好听的词藻除去以后，美国对日和约草案意味着美帝国主义和它的“新”伙伴——日本军国主义间的缜密阴谋。
    马里宁问道：美国对日和约草案的公布适在和平解决朝鲜战争的谈判开始时，这能认为是偶然的吗？他答道：自然不能。公布这个草案是故意打算用来使国际局势更加紧张。
    美国草案到处引起否定的态度，这是很自然的。据路透社报道，伦敦观察家很严重地认为，印度可能拒绝美英对日和约草案。路透社继续说：印度相信，没有中华人民共和国政府参加，在远东获得稳固和真正的解决办法是不可能的。印度相信这个和约草案是打算用来加深苏联和西方国家间的鸿沟。
    马里宁在结语中着重指出：和平保卫者的强大力量正不断发展和巩固中。苏联、中华人民共和国、其他各人民民主国家及一切爱好自由的人民，正不屈不挠地为争取和平解决战后问题及挫败战争挑拨者的阴谋而斗争。和平运动天天在发展中。和平运动已步入历史舞台，要防止战争并保证及巩固世界和平。它将把它的伟大而崇高的事业，胜利地进行到底。
