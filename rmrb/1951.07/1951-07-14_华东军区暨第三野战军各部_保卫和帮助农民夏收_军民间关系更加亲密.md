　　The cadres and soldiers of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army are actively protecting and helping the local farmers with their summer harvest and planting, as well as fighting drought and preventing floods.

　　In order not to hinder work and military training, the cadres and soldiers squeezed out time from their lunch breaks and rest periods to help the farmers with their summer harvest. Some units concentrated manpower to help farmers with harvesting. The direct subordinate units of the Anhui North Military Region, led personally by the director of the political department, dispatched more than 5,000 workdays in two days, harvesting wheat and transplanting rice for farmers on more than 2,000 mu. The troops stationed south of the Yangtze River particularly solved the difficulties faced by newly emancipated farmers who lacked labor and had to harvest wheat, weed, and transplant rice at the same time. Families of martyrs, military families, families of staff members, and poor farmers lacking labor were given priority assistance. The People's Liberation Army not only did a meticulous job in helping with harvesting and planting, but also declined any material compensation from the farmers, and many units even brought their own tea, which greatly moved the masses of farmers. An old Mrs. Wu, a blind military family member, asked someone to help her to the field, and while stroking the wheat harvested for her by the People's Liberation Army, she said to them, "I am really happy to touch the wheat you harvested. I feel that my children have learned to be as good as you."

　　This year, some areas of Zhejiang Province are experiencing a lack of rain, and the local garrisons are assisting the people in fighting the drought. The Lishui Sub-district garrison mobilized more than 1,000 cadres and soldiers to rush to repair a five-li-long dam in Yunhe County, enabling the irrigation of many nearby fields and protecting the areas near the county town from flooding. The bandit suppression troops scattered in various places also helped farmers catch insects, prevent drought, harvest wheat, and transplant rice. Many farmers said, "With the help of the People's Liberation Army, we have more confidence in fighting the drought."

　　In conjunction with helping with the harvest and fighting drought, the People's Liberation Army has extensively carried out propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries among the masses of farmers. Many units put up blackboards in the fields, performed short, lively skits and clapper talks, and cadres and soldiers also used the time they spent working and resting with the farmers to carry out oral propaganda.

　　During the summer harvest, the People's Liberation Army particularly strengthened vigilance along the coast and inland, closely cooperated with the local people's armed forces, and strictly prevented the sabotage activities of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements, so that this year's summer harvest in East China was carried out very smoothly.

　　After helping with the summer harvest, the relationship between the military and the people became even closer. Many farmers wrote letters to local newspapers, requesting commendation for the People's Liberation Army for helping and protecting their summer harvest. Warm military-civilian get-togethers are often held in the countryside. When the troops completed their assistance and moved to another location, the farmers presented flags and flowers, and beat gongs and drums to send them off for several li.

　　华东军区暨第三野战军各部
    保卫和帮助农民夏收
    军民间关系更加亲密
    华东军区和第三野战军各部的干部、战士积极保卫和帮助驻地农民夏收夏种，抗旱防汛。
    为了不妨碍工作和练兵，干部、战士都挤出午睡和休息时间去帮助农民夏收。有的部队就集中人力去帮助农民收割。皖北军区直属队在政治部主任亲自带领下，两天内出动五千多个工，为农民割麦、插秧二千多亩。驻在长江以南的部队，特别为缺少劳动力的新翻身农民解决了在同一时间要割麦、锄草和插秧的困难。烈士家属、军人家属和工作人员家属以及缺少劳动力的贫苦农民，都首先得到帮助。解放军在帮助收种中不仅做得精细，而且谢绝农民任何物质慰劳，许多部队连茶水都是自备的，这使农民群众非常感动。有一个瞎眼的军人家属吴老太太要人把她扶到地里，她一面抚着解放军替她割下的麦子，一面对解放军说：“摸着你们割下来的麦子，我真高兴。我觉得我的孩子也学得和你们一样好了。”
    今年浙江省部分地区缺雨，各地驻军就协助人民抗旱。丽水分区驻军曾出动一千多个干部战士，抢修云和县的一条五里长的堤坝，使附近许多田地得以灌溉，并使县城附近地区免受水灾。分散在各地的剿匪部队，也都帮助农民捉虫、防旱、割麦和插秧，许多农民说：“有解放军帮助我们，我们抗旱就更有信心了。”
    结合帮收和抗旱工作，解放军在农民群众中普遍进行了抗美援朝和镇压反革命的宣传。许多部队在田野里出黑板报，演唱短小的活报和快板，干部战士也利用和农民在一起劳动和休息的时间，进行口头宣传。
    在夏收中，解放军特别加强了沿海和内地的警戒，密切配合各地的人民武装，严密防止残余反革命分子的破坏活动，使今年华东各地夏收都进行得很顺利。
    经过帮助夏收后，军民关系更加亲密。许多农民写信给当地的报社，要求表扬帮助和保卫他们夏收的解放军。农村里常举行热烈的军民联欢会。当部队在帮收完工后移防时，农民们都献旗献花，打锣打鼓远送数里。
