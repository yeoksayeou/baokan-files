　　My Ideological Transformation
　　(Lin Kongxiang, Professor of Lingnan University)
　　I want to denounce the ideological poisoning inflicted upon me by American imperialism. I entered a church elementary school subsidized by the United States at the age of nine, and after graduating from elementary school, I entered a church middle school subsidized by the United States. After graduating from middle school, I entered an American church university. After graduating from university, I went to the United States to study for five years, and after returning to China, I taught at Lingnan University until now. It can be said that three-quarters of my life was spent under the ideological anesthesia of American imperialism. Therefore, before liberation, I was extremely pro-American and admired everything American. I felt that everything about America was good.
　　Now I am awakened, and my thinking has transformed. This change in thinking is the result of a considerable period of ideological struggle. I have new views on many issues.
　　The American imperialist elements who preached and ran "education" in China are thorough hypocrites, enjoying special rights in China under the guise of service. The American Foundation Committee of Lingnan University (hereinafter referred to as the Lingnan University American Foundation) is the institution of American imperialism ruling Lingnan University. The committee has always used the name of Lingnan University and the Chinese people to raise donations from the American people, and supplied the funds raised to its offices in New York and on campus to squander at will, and to a group of so-called "professors" who could not find jobs in the United States, enjoyed special privileges on campus, and rode on the heads of the Chinese people to squander. In 1947, the committee published a photograph of my one-year-old son (reaching out to ask for something) in the journal "Lingnan" (only circulated in the United States), Volume 13, Number 3, without my consent, to solicit donations from Americans. It was written on top: "All the Chinese faculty and staff of Lingnan University are now on the verge of starvation." Naturally, all the money donated in this way should be handed over to the school to improve the treatment of Chinese faculty and staff. But let's see how the Lingnan University American Foundation handled this money. The committee handed over all the donated funds to Fuller, the person in charge, for full disposal. This is how the money was spent: (1) Hiring a group of American ruffians to serve as "professors" at the school. Their salaries were on average about ten times higher than those of Chinese professors of the same rank, and they were provided with round-trip travel expenses and freight for all their luggage for their entire families, with luggage as many as dozens of pieces, weighing in tons. (2) Buying a new post-war Ford car from the United States and hiring a driver for Fuller's personal use. (3) Hiring two Western children's school teachers from the United States to teach the children of American faculty and staff at the school. (4) Hiring Fuller's personal female secretary and an assistant from the United States. The female teachers of the Western children's school and Fuller's female secretary and assistant were all replaced every year. In addition to paying them salaries, the American Foundation Committee of Lingnan University also paid for all their round-trip travel expenses and freight for all their luggage. (5) Hiring a Chinese comprador and a worker to be errand boys for this group of "foreign masters." The very small portion of donations left over was given to the president as capital for governing the administration of the school. What a shameless act. What is the difference between this group of American "educators" who wear the cloak of compassion to "serve" the Chinese people and bullies, robbers, and bandits?
　　The administrative measures of Chinese church schools are directly or indirectly controlled by American imperialism, and Lingnan University is of course no exception. Regarding the control of Lingnan University by American imperialism, I have ironclad evidence here. On February 1, 1946, the chairman of the American Foundation Committee of Lingnan University wrote a letter to my American friend, Mrs. Hayes (who worked at the Citrus Experiment Station in California). Mrs. Hayes sent me a copy of the letter, which said: "Our most reliable Dr. Fuller is preparing to leave his important position in the State Department and will go to China to serve as the supervisor of Lingnan University. He will exercise all his powers to control this school. We originally wanted him to serve in the State Department for two years, because his important relationship with the State Department will be very useful in the future." This passage in the letter not only proves that American imperialist elements controlled Lingnan University, but also proves that they were carrying out aggression against China under the instructions of the US State Department. In other words, the American imperialist elements who ran schools in China were entrusted with special tasks. This also reminds me of the fact that Jacob Henry, the former supervisor of Lingnan University and American imperialist element, worked as a spy in the Kunming US Military Strategic Intelligence Bureau during the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　Now I fully understand that the establishment of schools and hospitals in China by American imperialist elements is a smokescreen to cooperate with the overall plan of the American ruling clique to carry out aggression. They are shameless bandits, bloodless executioners, and we must resolutely sever our relationship with them, be determined to run our own schools well, wash away all our shame, and actively participate in the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. For our own survival, for the happiness of future generations, and for the freedom of all mankind in the world, we must use all our strength to eliminate the invaders, and we can no longer harbor any illusions about American imperialism. Only by thoroughly defeating their aggression schemes and eradicating the poison left by American imperialist cultural aggression can we defend our freedom, survival, and happiness!

　　我的思想转变
    （岭南大学教授林孔湘）
    我要控诉美帝国主义对我思想的毒害。我九岁进美国津贴的教会小学，小学毕业后进美国津贴的教会中学，中学毕业后又入美国的教会大学，大学毕业后再去美国留学五年，回国后就在岭南大学教书一直到现在。可以说，我一生四分之三的时间都在美帝国主义的思想麻醉中过生活。因此，造成了解放以前我极端亲美、崇美。我觉得美国的一切都是好的。
    现在我觉悟了，我的思想转变了。这个思想的转变是经相当长时间的思想斗争的结果。我对许多问题都有了新的看法。
    在中国传教和办“教育”的美帝国主义分子是彻头彻尾的伪善者，他们假服务之名在中国享受特殊权利。岭南大学的美国基金委员会（下简称岭南大学美基会）是美帝国主义统治岭南大学的机构，该会一向利用岭南大学和中国人民的名义向美国人民募捐，将所募得的款供给该会在纽约和在本校的办事处随意挥霍，供给一群在美国找不到职业，在本校享受特权，骑在中国人民头上的所谓“教授”来挥霍。一九四七年在该会发行的期刊《岭南》（只在美国流行）第十三卷第三期上未经我同意刊登我的周岁儿子的照片（伸手作向人要东西的姿势），向美国人捐款。上面写道：“现在岭南大学华籍教职员全体在饥饿线上。”这样捐来的钱自然应该全部交给学校，提高华籍教职员待遇。但是请看岭南大学美基会怎样处理这些钱的呢？该会将全部捐来的款交该会主持人富伦全权处理。这些钱是这样花掉的：（一）聘请一群美国流氓充任本校“教授”。他们的薪津平均比华籍同等教授的薪津约多十倍，供给他们全家来回美国的旅费和全部行李的运费，行李多至数十件，重量以吨计。（二）由美国买来一架战后新型的福特汽车，并雇一个司机供富伦私人使用。（三）由美国请来两个西童学校女教员，专教本校美籍教职员的子女。（四）由美国雇来一个富伦的私人女秘书和一个助手，西童学校的女教员和富伦的女秘书和助手都是每年更换的。岭南大学美国基金委员会除给他们薪津外，还给他们全部来回旅费和全部行李运费。（五）雇一个华籍买办和一个工人为这一班“洋大人”当跑腿。把剩下来的极少部分捐款交给校长作为统治本校行政的资本。这是多么无耻的行为。这班披着慈悲外衣为中国人“服务”的美国“教育家”，与恶霸、强盗、土匪有什么分别？
    中国教会学校的行政措施都直接或间接受着美帝国主义的操纵，岭南大学当然不能例外。关于美帝国主义统制岭南大学，我这里有一个铁的证据。一九四六年二月一日岭南大学美国基金委员会董事长写一封信给我的一个美国朋友黑斯夫人（在加里福尼亚州柑桔试验场服务）。黑斯夫人把这封信抄了一份寄给我，这信中有一段说：“我们最可靠的富伦博士，正准备离开他在国务院里的重要职位，就要到中国去充当岭南大学的监督。他将要施用他的全部职权来管制这个学校。我们原来就要他在国务院服务二年，因为他与国务院的重要关系，将来是很有用处的。”这封信的这一段话不但证明美帝国主义分子统制了岭南大学，而且证明了他们受美国国务院的指使进行对华侵略。也就是说在中国办学校的美帝国主义分子是负有特殊任务的。这又使我联想起岭南大学的前任监督美帝国主义分子香雅各在抗日战争时曾在昆明美军战略情报局当过间谍的事实。
    到现在我才完全明白美帝国主义分子在中国办学校、设医院是配合美国统治集团的全盘计划来进行侵略的烟幕。他们是无耻的匪徒，是杀人不见血的刽子手，我们必须坚决地斩断和他们的关系，下决心办好我们自己的学校，洗掉我们一切的耻辱，积极地参加抗美援朝保家卫国的工作。我们为着自己的生存，为着后代的幸福，为着全世界人类的自由，我们必须拿出我们一切的力量来消灭侵略者，我们对美帝国主义再也不能抱任何幻想。只有彻底地打垮他们的侵略阴谋，肃清美帝国主义文化侵略所遗下的毒害，才能保卫我们自由、生存和幸福！
