　　CPUSA National Committee Statement
　  Denounces US Government Collusion with Franco
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd] According to TASS, New York, 21st: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement denouncing the US government's preparation to establish a military agreement with the Franco regime, stating: Concluding a military alliance with the executioner of the Spanish people, who was fostered by Hitler and Mussolini, is an extreme manifestation of America's war policy. This policy has already, under the slogan of "defending democracy," brought together stubborn "defenders of democracy" such as Greece, Turkey, Chiang Kai-shek, Nazi generals of Germany, and feudal aristocrats. American public opinion and conscience must come out to stop this shameful and ruthless collusion. This collusion will attempt to use American guns and money to maintain Franco's regime and aid his bloody dictatorship oppressing the Spanish people; it will use Franco's fascist mercenary troops to oppose the European people; use Spanish bases to launch wars, and further intensify Wall Street's control over its vassals.
    The statement calls on all progressive people and advocates of peace in the United States to unite all forces against the conclusion of a military alliance with Franco, and take joint action to "oppose a war alliance with fascist Spain, demand a ceasefire, and demand the conclusion of a five-power peace pact."

　　美共全国委员会声明
　  斥美政府勾结佛朗哥
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国共产党全国委员会发表声明，痛斥美国政府准备与佛朗哥政权成立军事协议称：与希特勒和墨索里尼所扶植起来的屠杀西班牙人民的刽子手缔结军事同盟，是美国的战争政策狂暴到了极点的表现。这个政策已经在“保卫民主”的口号下，把希腊、土耳其、蒋介石、德国的纳粹将军和封建贵族之类的顽固的“民主保卫者”都纠合起来了。美国的民意和良心，必须出来制止这个可耻的冷酷的勾结。这种勾结将设法用美国的枪炮和金钱来维持佛朗哥的政权和援助他的压迫西班牙人民的血腥独裁制度；它将使用佛朗哥的法西斯雇佣军队来反对欧洲人民；使用西班牙的基地来发动战争，并更加加紧华尔街对它的附庸的控制。
    声明号召美国所有的进步人士和主张和平的人们，应该把反对与佛朗哥缔结军事同盟的一切力量都团结起来，共同行动，“反对与法西斯西班牙缔结战争同盟，要求停战，要求缔结五大国和平公约”。
