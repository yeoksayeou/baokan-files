　　The Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee Issues Instructions
　  Strengthen Regular Statistical Reporting of Capital Construction
    In order to promptly examine the implementation of capital construction plans and avoid serious losses and waste, and to establish a regular statistical reporting system, the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee issued instructions on June 28, promulgating unified forms, instructions, and implementation measures for regular statistical reporting of capital construction. In terms of forms, this regulation is simpler than in the past; in terms of scope of implementation, in addition to the construction units of the industrial system as originally stipulated, it has also been expanded to the construction units under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Water Resources, and Ministry of Agriculture. Regarding the reporting period, construction units under the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture will report quarterly, while construction units under other ministries will report monthly. The central-level construction units refer to construction units that use central government financial allocations for capital construction work.
    In the industrial systems of the major administrative regions within the customs, the reporting period for construction units that use financial allocations from the major administrative regions for capital construction shall be monthly or quarterly, as determined by the financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions; the forms used by construction units that use provincial and municipal financial allocations for capital construction in the local industrial systems shall be simpler than those used by state-owned enterprises, and the reporting period shall be monthly or quarterly, as determined by the provincial and municipal financial and economic committees.
    The Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee stipulated that the implementation date would be July 1. However, the work for the first half of this year must be summarized in a semi-annual report. Central-level construction units with larger scales must also make a written summary in addition to the semi-annual statistical summary, in order to review the work situation in the past six months. The reporting dates for each construction unit and each level of comprehensive agency are also specified separately, and each level of unit is instructed to compile and report on time, as the basis for checking this year's plan and future allocations.
    Note: Extremely complex organizational and technical work is required in capital construction. Due to our lack of experience, strengthening inspection has become a very urgent task. Only by mastering inspection can we promptly discover the shortcomings existing in the project and find out the deviations in the project development process; only then can we prevent such deviations and foresee the difficulties in completing the construction plan. Therefore, cadres engaged in economic construction work should attach importance to the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Committee's instructions on regular statistical reporting in capital construction and earnestly implement them.

　　中央人民政府财政经济委员会发出指示
　  加强基本建设的定期统计报告工作
    为求及时检查基本建设计划执行情况，避免严重的损失和浪费现象，建立定期统计报告制度，中央人民政府财政经济委员会曾于六月二十八日发出指示，颁发了统一的基本建设定期统计报告表式、说明及实施办法。此项规定中，在表式方面较过去简化；在实施范围中，除原规定工业系统建设单位仍须实施外，并扩大于中央人民政府铁道部、交通部、邮电部、水利部、农业部所属的建设单位。报告时期，除水利、农业两部所属建设单位为季报外，其他各部所属建设单位一律为月报。中央级所属的各建设单位，均系指使用中央财政拨款进行基本建设工作的建设单位。
    关内各大行政区工业系统中，用大行政区财政拨款进行基本建设的建设单位，报告时期为月报或季报，由各大行政区财政经济委员会决定；地方工业系统中用省、市财政拨款进行基本建设工作的建设单位使用的表式，较国营企业简单，报告时期为月报或季报，由省市财政经济委员会决定。
    实施日期，中央人民政府财政经济委员会规定为七月一日开始。但今年上半年的工作，须作一次半年总结报告。中央级规模较大的建设单位，除半年统计总结外，并须作文字总结，借此检讨半年来的工作情况。各建设单位及各级综合机关的报送日期，亦分别予以规定，并指示各级单位按期编报，以为检查本年度计划及今后拨款的依据。
    按：在基本建设中需要极端复杂的组织工作与技术工作。由于我们的经验不足，加强检查便成了一个十分迫切的任务。唯有掌握了检查，才能及时发现工程中存在的缺点，查明工程发展过程中的偏差；才能预防这种偏差，预见在建设计划完成上发生的困难。所以，从事经济建设工作的干部，应该重视中央人民政府财政经济委员会关于基本建设中定期统计报告的指示，切实执行。
