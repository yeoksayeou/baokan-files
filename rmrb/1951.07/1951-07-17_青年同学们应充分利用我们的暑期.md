The plan stipulates that the guiding principle for student summer activities is to organize the broad masses of students to actively respond to the three major calls of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association and to carry out various educational mass cultural, military sports, and learning activities in order to achieve the goal of continuously improving the ideological awareness of the broad masses of students, enhancing their health, and enriching and expanding their knowledge. The plan stipulates the organization of students to participate in the following activities: (1) Patriotic campaign to increase production and donations. Students are called upon to participate in labor production and various social work during the holidays. Such as participating in construction projects, transportation, agricultural production, and writing, painting, and serving as cultural instructors, copying, translating, and survey statistics, etc., and donating the proceeds. (2) Mass cultural activities: Students are called upon to organize various cultural and art groups to carry out literary and art activities such as singing, acting, dancing, reading literary works, music appreciation, and literary evenings. (3) Sports activities: Students from various schools are called upon to universally organize sports organizations and regularly conduct various sports activities and competitions. In addition, students will also be organized to target practice, camp, and hold youth lectures, and organize various science and technology research groups to conduct research activities such as aviation models, radio, and biology. Summer camps, children's parks, and various team days will be organized for children. The plan also proposes that each school should organize a "Student Summer Life Committee" composed of administration, Youth League branches, student unions, and Young Pioneer counselors to be responsible for guiding the summer life of students in each school. The Youth League branches of each school should also gradually establish regular work in the areas of mass culture, military sports, life and health, and children in conjunction with summer work.
