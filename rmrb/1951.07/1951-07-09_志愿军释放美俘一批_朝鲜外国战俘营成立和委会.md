　　志愿军释放美俘一批
    朝鲜外国战俘营成立和委会
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】中国人民志愿军最近又释放了十九名美军俘虏。这批战俘原是美海军陆战队第一师的官兵，于去年冬季在朝鲜东北部长津湖地区被俘。他们在被俘以后受到志愿军的宽大待遇和耐心教育，逐渐认识了侵略朝鲜的罪恶。他们曾参加了某俘虏营举行的拥护和平大会，并在致联合国的和平呼吁书上签了名。志愿军管理战俘部门在释放这批俘虏前，曾开会欢送他们。在会上，他们除衷心感谢志愿军的宽大待遇外，并表示回去后要把中国人民志愿军宽待俘虏的政策及美国侵略朝鲜的真相告诉他们的朋友和亲戚。
    此次释放的美军俘虏中计有陆军中尉一名，上士四名，中士二名，下士八名，兵士四名。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社平壤七日讯：在朝鲜的外国战俘营中，最近成立了和平委员会。《民主朝鲜》报报道，这个和平委员会举行了全体会议，会上选举了领导机构，通过了宣言和告联合国安全理事会书。这些文件说：战俘们因为认识到美帝国主义者对朝鲜人民所发动的战争的非正义性，他们决定成立和平委员会，和所有和平保卫者一道争取结束朝鲜战争，争取撤退在朝鲜境内的外国军队。
    【新华社八日讯】据电通社巴黎六日讯：接近法国政府的报纸《世界报》驻朝鲜记者余蓝本周透露：在朝鲜的法军一营一千人里面，已经“退出战斗”（死伤）的，共有七百人。余蓝又说：如果朝鲜战争继续下去，在朝鲜的原来一营法军就会死伤得仅剩少数的残废兵了。
