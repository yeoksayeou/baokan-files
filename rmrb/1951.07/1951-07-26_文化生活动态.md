　　Cultural Life Updates
  *People's Drama* Volume 3, Issue 3 Published
    *People's Drama*, the journal of the All-China Drama Workers Association, has undergone new improvements in content and form since its publication moved to Beijing from Volume 3, Issue 1. Volume 3, Issue 3 of the journal has recently been published. This issue discusses the question of how to create new heroic characters. Liu Zhiming's article, "Singing the Praises of Newborn, Revolutionary Heroic Figures," focuses on analyzing the achievements and experiences of the play *In Front of New Things* in creating positive and active heroic characters, while also discussing the achievements and shortcomings of the play *The Dike* and the opera *A Spark of Fire* in depicting heroic figures. Zhang Geng's "Brief Discussion on the Depiction of Heroic Figures" raises several issues worth noting when depicting heroic figures. In addition, articles such as "On the Artistic Achievements of 'Conspiracy'," "How 'The Fall of Berlin' Was Created," and "Review of the Film *Company Commander Guan*" also touch on the issue of creating heroic characters from different angles.
    This issue publishes A Jia's "From 'Four Scholars' to Talk About Mr. Zhou Xinfang's Stage Art," which affirms Zhou Xinfang's achievements in realistic performance methods from the aspects of character shaping, body movements, singing methods, and dialogue, while criticizing conservatism, formalism, and sectarianism on the Peking Opera stage.
  Introduction to *Literary Gazette* Volume 4, Issue 7
    *Literary Gazette* Volume 4, Issue 7 has been published. The main articles in this issue include "How Xiao Yemu's Works Violate the Truth of Life" (Ye Xiufu) and "Several Opinions on the Novel *Tempering*" (Le Daiyun), which take works such as *Between Us Husband and Wife*, *Love*, and *Tempering* as examples to specifically analyze the undesirable tendencies present in Xiao Yemu's works that violate the truth of life. "*Central Institute of Literature's* First Semester Study Situation and Problems" reports on the study situation and problems of the *Central Institute of Literature* from January to April 1951. These are all of concern to the general readership, including the understanding of the May Fourth New Literature Movement, the correct attitude towards writing, and the understanding of the relationship between life and creation, which are of reference value to current young writers and literature enthusiasts. Mi Gu's three cartoons, *Old Phenomena in the New Society* (Shanghai *Liberation Daily*), *Working at Sunrise, Resting at Sunset* (*Cartoon* Monthly), and *Two Kinds of Clothing* (Shanghai *Liberation Daily*), have attracted great attention and discussion among readers. Hua Junwu's "Talking About Mi Gu's Three Cartoons" analyzes and discusses these works, raising issues such as the subject matter of satirical drawings, the one-sidedness and comprehensiveness of criticism, and the local and the whole. The editorial of the Soviet magazine *Drama*, "The Skill of Playwrights," is an article worth noting. It raises and solves the correct relationship between life and artistic skills, and sternly criticizes the tendency to pursue "skills" divorced from life; it also discusses the structure and language of works. *Literary Gazette* Volume 3, Issues 10 and 12 published articles by comrades Zhou Libo, Xing Gongwan, and others on the issue of dialects, and launched an open discussion among readers. The *Discussion on the Issue of Dialects* published in this issue summarizes the opinions on this issue from more than forty submissions and letters. Some issues have been more clearly understood, but some issues still require further research and discussion.

    中华全国戏剧工作者协会的机关刊物《人民戏剧》，自三卷一期起移京出版后，内容和形式方面，都有了新的改进。该刊三卷三期已于近日出版。这一期讨论了如何创造新英雄人物的问题。刘芝明的《歌颂新生的、革命的英雄人物》一文，着重分析了话剧《在新事物面前》创造正面的积极的英雄人物的成就和经验，同时谈到话剧《堤》，歌剧《星星之火》在描写英雄人物上的成就与缺点。张庚的《略谈英雄人物的描写》，提出了描写英雄人物时值得注意的几个问题。此外如“论‘阴谋’在艺术上的成就”，“‘攻克柏林’是如何创作的”，“评电影《关连长》”诸文，也从不同的角度上接触到创造英雄人物的问题。
    这期发表了阿甲的“从‘四进士’谈周信芳先生的舞台艺术”，从性格塑造、身段动作、唱法和道白各方面，肯定了周信芳在现实主义表演方法上的若干成就，同时批评了京剧舞台上的保守主义、形式主义及宗派主义。
