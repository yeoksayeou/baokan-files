　　The private Xinxing Salt Factory in Zigong City, Southern Sichuan, after consultation between labor and management, has determined a concrete plan for improving management, increasing production, and donating weapons within the year.

　　The private Xinxing Salt Factory is a medium-sized salt factory in Zigong City. In 1949, the factory was forced to shut down for a time due to the collapse of the Kuomintang currency system. In 1950, it resumed production with the support of the People's Government. Recently, the factory implemented labor insurance, and the workers' enthusiasm for production is very high.

　　Since the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea issued the call on June 1st to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons, the factory workers were the first to respond, enthusiastically studying and discussing the matter. Everyone believed that the enthusiasm of the capitalists must be mobilized so that the factory's donation movement could be carried out in a planned manner on the basis of improving management, increasing production, and reducing costs.

　　At the end of June, the workers' opinion was agreed to by the capitalists. With the assistance of the city's Federation of Trade Unions and the Labor Bureau, labor and management held a five-day consultation meeting. The meeting decided to first establish a production increase and donation plan for both labor and management in the four departments with better production conditions: the charcoal-burning stove, the flat-bottomed pan stove, the first spark stove, and the first brine well. Both parties immediately signed a contract to affirm this plan.

　　According to this production increase plan, the four departments can overproduce 2,220 dan of salt and 2,220 dan of brine per month, saving approximately 13.72 million yuan in raw materials and equipment. It is estimated that the capitalist side can earn an extra 18.49 million yuan in net profit per month, and the workers can earn an extra 5.25 million yuan in production bonuses per month. The labor-management contract further stipulates that the workers will donate 60 percent of their production bonuses as donations within a half-year period, while the capitalists will donate all of their excess profits. In total, labor and management can donate over 129 million yuan by the end of the year to purchase airplanes and cannons. This ensures both the continuity of the production increase and donation movement and the original income of the capitalist and the original living standards of the workers.

　　In addition, in order to ensure the implementation of the above plan, the labor-management parties in the factory also stipulated specific guarantees for both parties in the contract, that is, the labor party should improve work efficiency, save equipment, and abide by the safety responsibility system, and the capitalist party should supply raw materials and equipment in a timely manner, add tools, and improve safety equipment and environmental sanitation.

　　The implementation of this production increase and donation plan has been effective, and it has now been extended to more than a dozen other wells and stoves in the factory.

　　川南自贡市私营新兴制盐厂
　  劳资协商订增产捐献计划 
　　在捐献中保证原来资方的收入额和工人的生活水平
    川南自贡市私营新兴制盐厂经过劳资协商，确定该厂本年内改善经营、增加生产、捐献武器的具体计划。
    私营新兴制盐厂为自贡市中等规模盐厂。一九四九年，该厂因受国民党币制崩溃的影响，曾被迫一度停工，至一九五零年，在人民政府扶助下又恢复生产。最近该厂实行了劳动保险，工人生产情绪很高。
    自六月一日中国人民抗美援朝总会发出增加生产捐献飞机大炮的号召后，该厂工人首先响应，热烈地进行了学习和讨论。大家认为，必须发动资方的积极性，该厂捐献运动才能在改善经营、增加生产、降低成本的基础上，有计划地开展。
    六月底，工人们的这个意见得到了资方的同意。劳资双方便在该市总工会和劳动局的协助下，举行了五天的劳资协商会议。会上决定首先在生产条件较好的炭巴灶、平锅灶、第一火花灶和第一卤井四个部门订立劳资双方的增产捐献计划。双方并即订立合同，将这个计划肯定下来。
    根据这个增产计划：该四部门每月可超额产盐二千二百二十担和卤水二千二百担，可节省原料和器材约一千三百七十二万元。计资方每月可多获超额纯利一千八百四十九万元，工人每月可多得超额生产奖金五百二十五万元。劳资双方的合同便进一步规定：工人在半年期内以生产奖金百分之六十作为捐款，资方则以全部超额利润作为捐献。共计，劳资双方在本年底可捐出一亿二千九百余万元购买飞机大炮。这样，既保证了增产捐献运动的经常性，又保证了资方原来的收入额和工人原来的生活水平。
    此外，为保证上述计划的贯彻实现，该厂劳资双方又在合同上规定了双方的具体保证条件，即劳方应提高工作效率，节省器材，遵守安全责任制度，资方应及时供应原料和器材，添增工具，改善安全设备和环境卫生等。
    这一增产捐献计划执行结果，效果良好，现已推广到该厂其他十多个井灶。
