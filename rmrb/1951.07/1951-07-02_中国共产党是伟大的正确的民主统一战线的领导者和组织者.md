　　The Communist Party of China is the Great, Correct Leader and Organizer of the Democratic United Front
　　Zhang Bojun
　　July 1, 1951, is the most glorious festival in the history of the Chinese people. It is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the party of the Chinese working class. All the Chinese people and all peace-loving and democratic people in the world are cheering and celebrating this great festival.
　　Every democratic party and every democratic person naturally has a certain understanding of such a historically significant day.
　　For many years, in the democratic united front, I have been a small soldier under command, without any meritorious service, and I am very ashamed!
　　Twenty-eight years ago—in 1923—I was a half-baked Communist Party member, but I could not stand the test. I did not truly understand Marxism-Leninism, did not shed the temperament of a petty-bourgeois intellectual, and even less did I truly convert to the working class. Therefore, once I reached a critical moment in the revolution, I left the organization. This shows that Chinese petty-bourgeois intellectuals, although they have revolutionary demands and revolutionary enthusiasm in certain periods, are always prone to wavering and are not qualified to serve as the main force of the revolution.
　　After leaving the party of the working class, I began to engage in the New Party Movement. For more than 20 years, from the establishment of the so-called Third Party to today's Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and participation in the Democratic League, in this series of political life and actions, I deeply realized that political groups representing the petty bourgeoisie can only maintain progress and find a way out under the leadership of the workers' party, the Communist Party.
　　"The Communist Party saved me." In the actual struggle life of the past 28 years, I have made many serious mistakes, especially after the failure of the Nanchang "August 1st"—1927—Uprising, I completely lost the position of the working class and internationalism and went into the quagmire of the so-called third road. However, the experience of the revolution has educated me after all, and the half-baked Marxism-Leninism I had previously learned has also helped me. I finally faced my "old home" after the Fujian People's Government incident. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was able to re-approach my revolutionary comrades and get their assistance and leadership. I was then able to confidently save myself and do my best in the work of democratic resistance against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek, and the United States, serving as a small soldier and a primary school student in the united front. Here, I and all our party comrades should express our heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.
　　"Wake up." In the democratic united front, the majority of people are moving forward in a progressive direction, asking the Communist Party to lead them, and asking to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. However, there are also some people who still cannot or are unwilling to understand the great events of transforming history created by the Chinese people. They cannot believe 100% that the old dynasty is gone forever. They still cherish the remnants of old democracy, which is worthy of our efforts to help. Necessary and well-intentioned corrections should be given as early as possible.
　　"We must thoroughly study Chairman Mao's On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Chairman Mao's On the People's Democratic Dictatorship, published on July 1, 1949, is an immortal masterpiece expounding Marxism-Leninism, and it has a special educational role for all democratic parties and democratic individuals in the country. At present, all democratic parties have unanimously decided to develop their organizations on a solid foundation. This is the correct line. However, all democratic parties must confirm the unified leadership of the Communist Party, confirm that the current regulations for the development of organizations by democratic parties are precisely the political tasks of expanding and consolidating the democratic united front, and are also creating conditions for the elimination of these political organizations. The national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie are not eternal. The historical task of our democratic parties is to strive for opportunities for these classes to learn, transform, and improve, so that they can gradually die out, that is, to open up the road to "Datong World" and the road to communism for all mankind. We should have patience, strength, and methods to complete this historical and combative democratic project.
　　Long live the great Communist Party of China!
　　Long live the great Chairman Mao!

　　中国共产党是伟大的正确的民主统一战线的领导者和组织者
    章伯钧
    一九五一年七月一日是中国人民历史上最光辉的节日。它是中国工人阶级的政党，中国共产党建党三十周年纪念日。全中国人民，全世界爱好和平民主的人民都在欢呼庆祝这个伟大的节日。
    每一个民主党派，每一个民主人士，对于有这样历史意义的日子自然有一定的认识。
    很多年来，在民主统一战线上，我是一个受指挥的小兵，从无汗马之劳，惭愧得很！
    二十八年以前，——一九二三年，我是一个一知半解的共产党员，但是经不起考验，没有真正懂得马克思列宁主义，没有脱除小资产阶级知识分子的气质，更没有真正皈依工人阶级，所以一旦到了革命严重的关头，我就离开了组织，这说明中国小资产阶级的知识分子，虽然在某些时期有革命的要求，有革命的热情，但总是易于动摇，没有充当革命主力的资格。
    脱离了工人阶级的政党以后，我开始从事新党运动，二十余年来，由所谓第三党的建立，一直演进到今日的中国农工民主党，和参加民主同盟。在这一系列的政治生活和行动中，我深切地认识了代表小资产阶级的政治集团，只有在工人政党共产党领导之下才能够保持进步，找到出路。
    “共产党救了我”。在二十八年来的实际斗争生活中，我犯了不少的严重的错误，特别是在南昌“八一”——一九二七年——起义失败以后，我完全失去了工人阶级和国际主义的立场，走到所谓第三条道路的泥坑中去了，然而，革命的经验毕竟教育了我，我以前所学习过的一知半解的马克思列宁主义也帮助了我，我终于在福建人民政府事变以后，面向了“老家”。在抗日战争爆发以后，我能够重新接近了革命战友，得到了他们的协助和领导，我才能有把握地得救出来，才能尽力于民主抗日反蒋反美的工作，在统一战线上当了一个小兵，当了一个小学生。在这里，我和我们的全党同志应向中国共产党和毛主席致衷心的感谢。
    “醒过来吧”。在民主统一战线中，大多数的人士朝着进步方向前进，要求共产党来领导他们，要求学习马克思列宁主义，和毛泽东思想。但是，也还有些人士对于中国人民所创造的改造历史的大事件，依然不能或不愿理解，不能百分之百地相信旧王朝是一去不复返了，他们对于旧民主主义还有抱残守缺的留恋，这是值得我们来努力帮助的对象。要及早给以必要的善意的纠正。
    “要熟读毛主席的论人民民主专政”。一九四九年七月一日毛主席所发表的论人民民主专政，是一篇不朽的发挥马克思列宁主义的杰作，对于全国各民主党派和民主人士有特殊教育的作用。目前，各民主党派已一致决定在巩固的基础上，进行组织的发展，这是正确的路线。但是，各民主党派则必须确认共产党的统一领导，确认今日民主党派发展组织的规定，正是扩大和巩固民主统一战线的政治任务，也正是创造消灭这些政治组织的条件，民族资产阶级和小资产阶级都不是永恒的东西，我们民主党派的历史任务，就是替这些阶级争取学习改造和提高的机会，让它们逐渐地死亡下去，也即是为全人类开辟“大同世界”的道路，共产主义的道路。我们应当有耐心，有力量，有方法，来完成这一段历史性的战斗性的民主工程。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛主席万岁！
