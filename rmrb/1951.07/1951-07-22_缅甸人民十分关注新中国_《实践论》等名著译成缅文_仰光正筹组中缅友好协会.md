Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Rangoon: Chairman Mao's famous work "On Practice" has been translated into Burmese and published in the Burmese "Flying Eagle Daily" in Rangoon.

Because the Burmese people are paying close attention to New China, many books about New China are being translated into Burmese and successively published in Burma. Recently published was "The Chinese People's Liberation Army." Forthcoming publications include Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party," "The First Year After Victory," and "Women in New China." Currently being translated are Liu Shaoqi's "Internationalism and Nationalism" and the "Outline Land Law of China."
