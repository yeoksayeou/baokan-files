The Tianjin Textile, Yarn, Cloth and Silk industry merchants, through in-depth publicity mobilization and practical improvement of management, have victoriously completed their donation plan. The industry originally planned to donate one airplane, but has now donated two. The donation for the first airplane has been paid in advance, and the donation for the second airplane will also be paid in full soon. The planes donated by this industry are the first to be paid for by the city's commercial sector. Recently, the industry held a parade to celebrate the early payment for the planes and challenged all industrial and commercial households in the city.

Since April, the Tianjin Textile, Yarn, Cloth and Silk industry has established an industry-wide patriotic pact, clearly putting forward the slogan "Contribute all our strength to support the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea." The industry's trade association also organized a study class with more than 300 managers participating, and regularly invited experts to give current affairs reports and conduct patriotic education. Therefore, the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the industry's employees have been greatly improved, laying a good foundation for this production increase and donation campaign.

Since the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued its three calls, the industry, under the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, organized a branch of the Production Increase and Donation Campaign Committee. In addition to the more than 20 members of the trade association, more than 60 activists were absorbed to serve as committee members. The committee used methods such as conferences, forums, small group meetings, and door-to-door publicity to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization work. The committee members repeatedly explained to each merchant the significant political significance of the donation campaign and the principle that it must be combined with improved management to increase income. At the same time, they conducted propaganda and education aimed at the ideological situation of a few merchants. For example, in the early stage of the donation campaign, some merchants had "comparison" and "wait-and-see" thoughts, thinking that increasing production and making donations was right, but why did a certain merchant, whose resources were similar to their own, donate less than themselves? The members of the Production Increase and Donation Campaign Committee branch used various meetings to explain that increasing production and making donations was a concrete manifestation of patriotic enthusiasm, and everyone should learn from the advanced. The committee also formulated reward measures and called on everyone to launch a red flag competition. At the same time, discussions were carried out in groups, and many groups, in connection with the industry's improved business situation, further realized the great significance of the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front for defending the motherland, and the donation campaign was rapidly launched.

Another important reason why the Tianjin Textile, Yarn, Cloth and Silk industry quickly completed the donation plan is that the industry conscientiously followed the instructions of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, paid attention to improving management, and strived to increase income, thus not only donating weapons, but also increasing the profits of their own businesses. For example, in the production increase and donation campaign, Qian Xiang Yi Chen Ji, in order to develop its business, implemented the principle of small profits and quick turnover and facing the countryside, specially published the price list of its goods in the "Purchase and Sales Newsletter" published by the Tianjin Postal Administration, distributed it to various places, and attracted many merchants from Northeast China, Gansu, Hebei and other places to order goods from it. The labor and management of the company also reached an agreement to plan to launch a business competition in the near future to increase income. Renfeng Cloth Shop also, through labor-management consultation, took the initiative to solicit business, improved its attitude towards customers, and implemented the principle of small profits and quick turnover, so that its business gradually developed. June is generally a slow month for production and sales, but the company still maintained a business volume equal to that of the peak season.

### 天津市花纱布绸业  深入宣传改善经营胜利完成捐献计划

　　天津市花纱布绸业
    深入宣传改善经营胜利完成捐献计划
    天津市花纱布绸业商户由于深入宣传动员和切实改善经营，已胜利完成捐献计划。该业原来计划捐献飞机一架，现已捐献飞机两架。购买第一架飞机的捐款已提前交齐，第二架飞机的捐款也将在最近缴齐。该业捐献的飞机是全市商业界首先缴款的第一架。日前该业特举行了提前缴款购买飞机的游行，并向全市工商户提出挑战。
    天津市花纱布绸业自四月份以来就订立了行业的爱国公约，明确提出“贡献一切力量支援抗美援朝战争”的口号，该业同业公会并组织了有三百多名经理参加的学习班，经常聘请专人作时事报告，进行爱国主义学习。因此，该业从业人员的政治觉悟和爱国热情，大为提高，为这次增产捐献运动打下了很好的基础。
    自从中国人民抗美援朝总会发出三项号召后，该业即在市工商业联合会领导下，组织了增产捐献运动委员会分会，除同业公会的二十多名委员参加外，并吸收了六十多名积极分子担任委员。该委员会采用大会、座谈会、片会、挨户宣传等方式，进行了广泛深入的宣传动员工作，由各委员向各商户反复说明捐献运动的重大政治意义和必须结合改善经营增加收入的原则，同时针对少数商人的思想情况进行宣传教育。比如在捐献运动初期，部分商户存有“比较”“观望”思想，认为增产捐献是应当的，但某某商户和自己资力相当，为什么比自己捐的少？增产捐献运动委员会分会的委员利用各种会议进行解释，说明增产捐献是爱国热情的具体表现，大家应向先进的看齐。该委员会并订出奖励办法，号召大家开展红旗竞赛。同时，以小组为单位展开讨论，很多小组联系本行业营业好转的情况，进一步认识到朝鲜前线志愿军的英勇作战对于保卫祖国的伟大意义，捐献运动因而迅速地开展起来。
    天津市花纱市绸业迅速完成捐献计划的另一个重要原因，是该业切实遵照中国人民抗美援朝总会的指示，注意改善经营，力求增加收入，这样不仅捐献了武器，而且增加了本商号的盈益。如谦祥益辰记在增产捐献运动中，为开展业务，贯彻薄利多销、面向农村的方针，特在天津邮政管理局刊行的《购销简讯》上公布该号各货价目，分发各地，招来东北、甘肃、河北等地许多客商纷纷向其订货。该号劳资双方还进行协议，计划在最近开展业务竞赛，以增加收入。仁丰布庄亦经劳资协商，主动兜揽生意，改进对待顾客态度，贯彻薄利多销方针，使业务日渐开展。六月份一般为产销淡月，但该号仍然保持了与旺月相等的营业额。
