Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC held a grand celebration meeting at Yiyuan Square on June 30th.

In addition to party member cadres working in various agencies in East China and Shanghai, the meeting was attended by revolutionary activists, labor models, model workers among workers and students in Shanghai, representatives of people's organizations in East China and Shanghai, and representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties in China in East China, totaling more than 17,000 people. Ms. Soong Ching Ling was also invited to attend. The meeting was opened by Chen Yi, followed by a report by Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Rao Shushi said, "Shanghai is the city with the most concentrated number of workers in China and the birthplace of the Communist Party of China. We are particularly pleased and encouraged to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China and the great victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people in Shanghai today." He pointed out that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This great victory not only ended the dark rule of imperialism and the reactionaries in China and established a people's democratic republic led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, but also opened up a smooth path for China to move towards socialism and communism. He elaborated in detail the rich experience of the Communist Party of China in leading the people's democratic united front and the armed struggle as the main form of the Chinese revolution over the past 30 years, as well as the Party's style of close contact with the masses, and called on all party members in East China and Shanghai to study the history of the Party, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve the political and theoretical level of the entire Party, and advance under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong!

Soong Ching Ling then addressed the meeting, congratulating the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

At the meeting, Yin Yongxing, a combat hero of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, Yu Lanting, an old worker with more than 30 years of work experience, and Xu Fengying, the initiator of the first Ma Hengchang-style production group among female workers in Shanghai, delivered speeches.

All attendees adopted a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao and the CPC Central Committee with thunderous applause. The meeting ended with the entire audience singing The Internationale.
