　　Beijing Public Changcheng Printing Factory and Private Tongjin Binding Bureau
    Careless Work Causes Serious Waste

My department commissioned the Beijing Public Changcheng Printing Factory to print 30,000 copies of cadre resume forms. The printing was done by Changcheng, and the binding and some processing were subcontracted by Changcheng to the private Tongjin Binding Bureau. At that time, a contract was established based on standard samples. However, upon initial delivery, we discovered that many aspects of Tongjin's processing and binding did not meet the standards, such as the gold lettering revealing a red background, the hot stamping being misaligned, uneven binding, insecurely pasted covers, and missing or extra pages. We immediately criticized Tongjin and demanded that their work meet the prescribed standards. However, the person in charge of Tongjin only responded with "Haha!" and "Yes, yes," or emphasized objective reasons such as "lack of experience!" and "the five fingers are not all the same length!" They never seriously considered how to correct the shortcomings and improve quality. Instead, the work became increasingly worse and more significant errors occurred. They piled the pasted hardcover boards together without cooling or drying them, causing a large portion to become moldy. As a result, 5,099 red lacquer cloth covers (equivalent to 500 yards of lacquer cloth) were completely unusable, resulting in a loss of over 50 million yuan, including paper materials and labor costs. If they had done their work conscientiously, they could have obtained reasonable profits, but now they have incurred significant losses. We believe there are two reasons for this: (1) The public Changcheng Printing Factory signed a contract with us but failed to fulfill its responsibility, neglecting to assist, lead, and supervise the private Tongjin Binding Bureau effectively. Although they occasionally sent people to check, it was ineffective, and after the incident, Changcheng personnel rarely appeared, avoiding our criticism. They even wanted us to accept the unusable damaged goods, saying that "in any case, it's a loss for the public sector." It is precisely because of their poor bureaucratic style and employment mindset that they can neglect their duties, which is a significant cause of the loss. (2) The Tongjin Binding Bureau only focused on profit-making and ignored the quality of the product, therefore, they were careless in executing the contract and sloppy in their work. When we discovered that they were piling the pasted hardcover boards together without cooling or drying them, we raised our concerns three times, but they always dismissively said, "It's alright." By the time the mold was discovered, it was beyond repair.

Currently, factories across the country are launching patriotic production campaigns for resisting America and aiding Korea, increasing output and improving quality. However, the public Changcheng Printing Factory and the private Tongjin Binding Bureau are carrying out their work with such an attitude, leading to serious waste, which should be thoroughly examined.

　　北京公营长城印刷厂及私营同进装订局
    工作马虎造成严重浪费编辑同志：
    我部在北京公营长城印刷厂印制了三万份干部履历书，印刷是由长城作的，装订和一部分加工是长城转由私营同进装订局作的。当时并根据标准样本订立了合同。但在最初交货时，我们就发现同进在加工装制上不少地方不合标准，如烫金字露红底，火印位置不正，订的不齐，糊的皮子不牢，多页少页等。我们即向同进提出批评，要求他们作的活应合规定标准。可是同进的负责人不是“哈哈！”“是是”，就是强调客观原因，“没有经验呀！”“五个手指不能一样齐呀”等等。从不认真考虑如何改正缺点提高质量，作的反而越来越坏，并出了更大的差错。他们把糊好的硬皮子不凉不晒，压在一起，使很大一部分发了霉，结果有五千零九十九份红漆布皮（合漆布五百码）根本不能用了，连纸料人工等共损失五千余万元。他们若踏踏实实的作活，本来可以获得合理利润的，但现在却几乎造成亏损。究其原因，我们认为有以下两点：（一）公营长城印刷厂和我们订了合同，但却没有很好地负起责任，放松了对私营同进装订局的帮助、领导和督促。他们虽然有时派人去转转看看，实际并不起什么作用，并且在出事以后，长城的人更是很少见面，以避我们的指责；对于根本不能用的坏货，他们还想叫我们收下，说什么“无论如何都是公家的损失”。正是由于他们这种恶劣的官僚主义作风和雇佣观点，所以他们可以放任不管，这是造成损失的重要原因。（二）同进装订局只图营利赚钱不管产品好坏，因此，执行合同马虎，做活草率。当我们发现他们把糊好的硬皮压在那里不凉晒时，曾三次向他们提出意见，但他们总是毫不在意地说：“不要紧。”到发现发霉，已不可收拾。
    现各地工厂均在为抗美援朝开展爱国主义生产竞赛，增加产量提高质量，而公营长城印刷厂和私营同进装订局却以这样的态度进行工作，以致造成严重浪费，这是应该好好检讨的。
