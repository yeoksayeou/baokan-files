"Strive to kill the enemy, and we will be responsible for taking care of your families." Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    For the liberation of the Korean people and to defend the security of our motherland, you have fought side by side with the Korean People's Army and won five great victories in less than a year, annihilating more than 200,000 of the American and Rhee bandit troops. This victory was bought with your blood. Your lofty spirit of unparalleled patriotism and internationalism is worthy of our constant learning.
    After listening to the reports from Li Furen, head of the Northwest Sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, and other representatives, I learned that you are fighting the enemy under extremely difficult circumstances, with little food or drink, suffering from cold and hunger. I was moved to tears by your heroic deeds. I really wish I could fly to Korea immediately and fight the enemy alongside you. I am a worker in the field of preferential treatment. I want to learn from your spirit of hard struggle and am determined to do a good job in preferential treatment, ensuring that the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers do not suffer difficulties, and helping them gradually establish good households.
    The old liberated areas of northern Shaanxi suffered from the ravages and looting of the Hu Zongnan bandit troops in 1947, and the living standards of the families of martyrs and soldiers generally declined. In order to take care of the affordability of the masses in the old liberated areas of northern Shaanxi and improve the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers, the Central People's Government allocated 115,000 dan of preferential treatment and subsidy grain last winter and this spring. We sent working groups to northern Shaanxi twice to help distribute the grain and help the families of martyrs and soldiers buy livestock and farm tools, and help solve their living difficulties, so that the families of martyrs and soldiers in northern Shaanxi established households and improved their lives. Last year, Xi'an City allocated more than 240,000 jin of millet to help the families of martyrs and soldiers set up cooperatives and handicraft factories, or subsidize the living difficulties of the families of martyrs and soldiers. Last year, the Central People's Government allocated another 5.6 million jin of millet to the Northwest as comfort grain (exclusively for the families of martyrs). We sent special personnel to慰问the families of martyrs with grain, and at the same time instructed governments at all levels to organize慰问groups to慰问the families of martyrs and help them solve difficulties and build households. For example, among the 197 households of martyrs in Chunhua County, Shaanxi, 82 households received comfort grain, of which 44 households bought livestock, 11 households bought farm tools, and 27 households solved their living difficulties. Recently, the Central People's Government allocated a large sum of money to the Northwest for the purpose of preferential treatment and subsidies for the families of martyrs and soldiers. We have convened a meeting of the heads of civil affairs departments of various provinces and decided that, in addition to using a portion to subsidize poor families of martyrs and soldiers, the majority should be used to help them organize cooperatives, set up small handicraft factories, buy livestock and farm tools, and help develop sideline production according to different local conditions. This fund has been allocated to various provinces.
    During the Spring Festival this year, the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Northwest launched enthusiastic movements to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers. For example, in Dihua City, more than 130 representatives of Islamic Ahongs and representatives of 48 industries in the business community presented cattle, sheep, fatty fish, Hami melons, raisins, etc. to the local garrison and the families of martyrs and soldiers, hung plaques with the words "Glorious Home of Soldiers" on the doors of more than 170 households of martyrs and soldiers, and distributed 42 banners to the families of martyrs and soldiers, expressing the people's love and respect for them. The people of all ethnic groups and all strata in Xi'an City and various organs and units selected representatives to form 60慰问groups and Yangko teams, carrying pork, mutton, snacks, honorary plaques,慰问letters, etc., to慰问the families of martyrs and soldiers, and organized a慰问团to慰问the honorary soldiers of the Northwest District Honorary Soldiers Recuperation Institute in Huayin, Shaanxi.
    Most of the honorary soldiers who have undergone recuperation and study at the Honorary Soldiers Recuperation Institute in the Northwest District have taken up their jobs. Those who requested to return home have been taken care of by the local government and people and have established households. In areas where land reform has been carried out, they have been given priority in receiving land, livestock, houses, and farm tools. For example, the 17 honorary soldiers settled in Huayin County, Shaanxi, were all allocated land, livestock, houses, farm tools, etc. during the land reform. Wang Fu, an honorary soldier from Yanchi County, Ningxia, wrote to us saying that he was allocated 30 mu of land and a donkey during the land reform.
    Recently, we have added houses to the Huayin Honorary Soldiers Recuperation Institute. In addition, we are preparing to build two more honorary soldiers' recuperation institutes so that the people's heroes who were gloriously wounded for the motherland can come back to recuperate.
    Respectable and beloved comrades of the People's Volunteer Army! Your victorious battle reports have encouraged the hearts of every people in the entire Northwest. The people of the Northwest are all your reserve forces. Please rest assured that we are responsible for taking care of your families, and we will solve all difficulties. The General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea recently called on the people of the whole country to do a good job in preferential treatment. The people of the motherland have written this call and task into their patriotic covenants, and we will definitely do this work better. I hope you will strive to kill the enemy on the front line and strive for greater victories. I extend my highest respect.
        Zhang Chenggong, Director of the Preferential Treatment Bureau of the Civil Affairs Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee
        Overseas Chinese in Surabaya, Indonesia, write letters to慰问the Volunteer Army: Brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    In order to assist the Korean people, to defend the security of the motherland and world peace, you bravely crossed the Yalu River and rushed to the Korean front to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army to strike at the American invading troops and have won countless glorious victories. We overseas Chinese in Indonesia are extremely excited to see your great internationalist and patriotic actions in the newspapers. Your brilliant achievements have made us overseas Chinese more aware of the true face of the American imperialist paper tiger, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and have made us more deeply appreciate the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. We assure you that we will support you with practical actions such as refusing to watch American movies and exposing the American imperialist conspiracy of aggression. Now we would like to write this letter with twelve thousand points of enthusiasm to express our incomparable respect to you.
      With best regards,
      Youth Department of the Rongqiao Library Yuerong Association, Surabaya, Indonesia

　　写给志愿军
  “望努力杀敌，你们的家属有我们负责照顾。”中国人民志愿军指战员同志们：
    你们为了解放朝鲜人民，保卫我们祖国的安全，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，不到一年的时间，就获得了五次大胜利，歼灭了美李匪军二十多万。这个胜利，是用你们的鲜血换来的。你们这种无比的爱国主义与国际主义的崇高精神，值得我们时刻学习。
    我听了中国人民赴朝慰问团西北分团李敷仁团长及其他代表们的报告，知道你们在无比困难的环境下与敌作战，吃不上，喝不上，受寒挨冻，我被你们的英雄事迹感动得流泪，我真恨不得马上飞到朝鲜，和你们一起杀敌。我是一个优抚工作者，我要学习你们艰苦奋斗的精神，决心把优抚工作做好，保证烈属军属的生活不发生困难，并且要帮助烈属军属逐渐建立好家务。
    陕北老区在一九四七年遭受了胡宗南匪军的蹂躏抢劫，烈属军属生活水平一般降低。中央人民政府为了照顾陕北老区群众的负担能力和提高烈属军属生活，去冬今春先后拨来优待补助粮十一万五千石。我们曾二次派工作组去陕北帮助发放，并帮助烈属军属买牲畜、农具，帮助解决生活困难，使陕北烈属军属建立了家务，改善了生活。西安市去年拨出了二十四万多斤小米，帮助烈属军属搞合作社、手工业工厂或补助生活困难的烈属军属。去年中央人民政府又给西北拨来安抚粮（专给烈属）五百六十万斤小米。我们曾派专人带粮去慰问烈属，同时责成各级人民政府组织慰问组慰问烈属和帮助烈属解决困难、建设家务。如陕西淳化县一百九十七户烈属中，就有八十二户得到了安抚粮，其中四十四户买了牲口，十一户买了农具，二十七户解决了生活困难。最近中央人民政府又给西北拨来一大笔款项，作为优待补助烈属军属之用。我们已召开了各省民政厅长会议，决定除以一部分补助贫苦烈属军属外，大部分要帮助烈属军属组织合作社、办小手工业工场、买牲畜、农具，并按各地不同情况帮助发展副业生产。此款已分拨各省。
    今年春节时，西北各地各民族各界人民，曾掀起了热烈的拥军优属运动。如迪化市有一百三十多名伊斯兰教阿訇代表和工商界四十八个行业的代表，向当地驻军和烈属军属献牛羊、肥鱼、哈密瓜、葡萄干等，给一百七十多户烈属军属门上挂起“光荣军人之家”的匾额，并分送了四十二面锦旗给烈属军属，表示人民对他们的热爱和尊敬。西安市各民族各阶层人民及各机关单位选出代表，组织了六十个慰问小组和秧歌队，带着猪羊肉、点心、光荣牌、慰问信等，分别到烈属军属家中慰问，并组织了慰问团，前赴陕西华阴慰问西北区荣誉军人教养院的荣誉军人。
    西北区已往经过荣誉军人教养院休养学习的荣誉军人，大部都已走上了工作岗位。要求回家的，都得到当地人民政府和人民的照顾，建立了家务。在已进行过土地改革的地区，他们都优先分到了土地、牲畜、房屋和农具。如陕西华阴县安置的十七名荣誉军人，土地改革时都分到了土地、牲畜、房屋、农具等。宁夏盐池县荣誉军人王福，给我们来信说，他在土地改革中分到了三十亩地和一头毛驴。
    最近我们在华阴荣誉军人教养院增修了房子，此外，还准备修两处荣誉军人教养院，好使为祖国而光荣负伤的人民功臣回来休养。
    可敬可爱的人民志愿军指战员同志们！你们胜利的战报，鼓舞了全西北每个人民的心。西北人民都是你们的后备力量。请你们放心，你们的家属有我们负责照顾，一切困难由我们解决。抗美援朝总会最近号召全国人民作好优抚工作，祖国人民已把这个号召和任务，写入他们的爱国公约，我们一定会把这个工作做得更好。望你们在前线努力杀敌，争取更大的胜利。谨致崇高的敬礼
        西北军政委员会民政部优抚局局长  张成功
        印尼泗水华侨写信慰问志愿军中国人民志愿军勇士们：
    你们为了援助朝鲜人民，为了保卫祖国安全和世界和平，英勇地跨过鸭绿江，奔赴朝鲜前线，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打击美国侵略军队，获得了无数次辉煌的胜利。我们印尼的华侨在报纸上看到你们这种伟大的国际主义与爱国主义的行动，感到万分兴奋。你们辉煌的战绩，使我们华侨更认清了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎的真面目，更深刻地体会到祖国的伟大和可爱。我们向你们保证，我们要用拒看美国影片，揭发美帝国主义侵略阴谋等实际行动来支援你们。现在我们谨以十二万分热诚的心写这封信向你们表示无比的敬意。
      此致 崇高的敬礼
