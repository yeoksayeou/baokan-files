　　Poor Design and Neglect of Public Suggestions
　  Large-Scale Collapse of Warehouse Caves in a Certain Area

Editor:
    A large number of warehouse caves built last year by the engineering office of a certain local Civil Aviation Administration collapsed due to design errors and the neglect of correct suggestions from local people during construction.
    Last winter, the engineering office decided to build 46 large-scale caves, each 20 meters deep, 6 meters high, and 4 meters wide, in a sloped gully less than 300 meters long, with a deadline of 100 days. The local soil was hard in the upper and middle layers but soft in the lower layer, making the construction of large caves dangerous. Furthermore, the gully was short, and the number of caves was excessive. The distance between each cave was only 4 or 5 meters wide, making the foundations insufficient to support the pressure from above. During construction, the engineering personnel did not follow the soil transportation methods stipulated in the construction contract. Instead, they ordered workers to dig two holes from the top of the caves (intended for ventilation pipes), transport the excavated soil out through the "holes," and pile it directly on top of the caves (averaging more than one meter thick), directly increasing the load on the caves. This practice was opposed by the workers, but the person in charge of the project replied to the workers, "You don't understand, mind your own business!" Because the caves were too close together, workers suggested that they should not all be started at the same time but should be excavated in phases. After each phase was bricked and made solid, another section should be excavated. The excavation method, according to the long-accumulated experience of the masses, should be: first excavate one side, wait for a certain period, and then excavate the other side. This would ensure that the caves were solid and durable. However, these correct opinions were not valued by the designer of the project. They only cared about ordering workers to rush the excavation. As a result, about 50 days into the project, more than three-quarters of the caves collapsed one after another, and the entire project had to be abandoned. The loss in wages and grain alone was nearly 400,000 catties; the losses from bricks, stones, wood, and transportation costs have not yet been calculated. The above issues have not been resolved, and local people have many complaints. Relevant authorities should pay attention.

### 设计错误又忽视群众建议  某地仓窑大批倒塌

　　设计错误又忽视群众建议
　  某地仓窑大批倒塌编辑同志：
    民航局某地工程处去年修筑的大批仓库窑洞，因设计错误，在施工中又忽视当地群众的正确建议，以致大部窑洞倒坍。
    去年冬季该工程处决定在不足三百公尺长的一条坡地沟道中，修筑深二十公尺，高六公尺、宽四公尺的大型窑洞四十六孔，限期一百天完工。当地土质中、上层坚硬，下层松软，修筑大型窑洞是有危险性的，又因沟道短，窑洞数量过多，每孔窑间的距离、仅四、五公尺宽，使地基不足支撑窑洞上面压力。在施工中，该处工程人员不按修筑合同规定的运土办法，却命令工人从窑顶向上挖通两个洞眼（准备作通气筒用），将窑内所挖的土通过“洞眼”运出，并就地堆积在窑上（平均堆了一公尺多厚），直接加重了窑洞的负担。这种做法，曾遭到了工人们的反对。但修筑该项工程的负责人竟回答工人说：“你们不懂，少管些！”由于窑洞距离太近，工人曾经提出，不要急于在同一时间动工，而应该分期挖掘，用砖石砌好使之坚固后，再挖另一部分；挖掘的方法，按照群众长期积累的经验应该是：先挖一个侧面，等一定时间后，再挖另一侧面，如此才能使窑洞坚固耐久。但这些正确的意见，却不为该项工程的设计人所重视。他们只顾命令工人赶工挖掘。结果在工程进行五十天左右时，四分之三以上的窑洞陆续倒塌，全部工程被迫放弃。仅工资米一项损失就近四十万斤；其他如砖石木料运费的损失，尚未统计。以上问题至今未得解决，当地群众意见很多，有关机关应予注意。
