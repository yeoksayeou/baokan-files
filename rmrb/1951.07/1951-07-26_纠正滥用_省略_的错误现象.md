    Correct the Erroneous Phenomenon of Abusing "Omission"

    To the Editor:
    Since June, the People's Daily has serialized the speeches on grammar and rhetoric by Mr. Lü Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi, which is of great significance for correcting shortcomings in the use of language. I have also received preliminary help in my studies. In the past, I often had problems with ambiguity and confusion when using language, especially the abuse of abbreviated words. I would arbitrarily make inappropriate omissions for any name with more than two characters. I often wrote "土匪特务 (tu fei te wu) bandits and secret agents" as "匪特 (fei te)," "扫除文盲 (sao chu wen mang) eliminate illiteracy" as "扫盲 (sao mang)," and "土地改革 (tu di gai ge) land reform" as "土改 (tu gai)." Even more seriously, I wrote "中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会 (Zhongguo Renmin Baowei Shijie Heping Fandui Meiguo Qinlue Weiyuanhui) Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against American Aggression" as "保反委员会 (Bao Fan Weiyuanhui)," and "冬季运输和冬学运动 (dongji yunshu he dongxue yundong) winter transportation and winter literacy movement" as "冬运 (dong yun)," etc., which made it difficult for people to understand. Mr. Lü Shuxiang and Mr. Zhu Dexi said in the seventh paragraph of the second lecture of "Grammar and Rhetoric Speeches" (hereinafter referred to as "the lecture"): "The problem with abbreviations is that it is often not easy to infer the full name from the abbreviation. If it is newly coined, it often leaves people confused." This was a good lesson for me. At the same time, I often see many comrades using abbreviated words in newspapers and magazines, which shows that the abuse of "omission" has become a common problem. This is a phenomenon that corrupts the language of the motherland and must be corrected. Therefore, I suggest that we all study "Grammar and Rhetoric Speeches" and strive to use the language of the motherland correctly.

### 纠正滥用“省略”的错误现象

    纠正滥用“省略”的错误现象编辑同志：
    人民日报自六月份以来连载了吕叔湘、朱德熙两先生关于语法修辞的讲话，这对于纠正使用语言文字中的缺点，是具有极重要意义的。我在学习中，也初步得到了帮助。过去，我在使用语言时往往有含糊和混乱的毛病，特别是滥用省略词。对于任何两个字以上的名称都任意加以不适当的省略。我经常把土匪特务写成“匪特”，把扫除文盲写成“扫盲”，把土地改革写成“土改”；更严重的是把中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会写成“保反委员会”，把冬季运输和冬学运动写成“冬运”等等，这就使人不容易懂得。吕叔湘、朱德熙两先生在《语法、修辞讲话》第二讲第七段（简称）中说：“简称的毛病是往往不容易从简称悟出全称。如果是新造的，就往往让人家莫名其妙。”这对我是一个很好的教育。同时，我在报纸和杂志上也经常看到很多同志用省略词，可见滥用“省略”已成为一种通病。这是一种败坏祖国语言的现象，是必须纠正的。因此，我建议我们大家都来学习《语法、修辞讲话》，为正确地使用祖国语言而努力。
