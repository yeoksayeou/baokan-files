    Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau and Beijing Paper Mill
    Inspection Regarding Errors in Sewer Project
    Both Parties Are Responsible, with the Sanitation Engineering Bureau Bearing More Responsibility
    The Central Ministry of Light Industry Also Conducted Self-Criticism Regarding This Matter
    Editor's Note: On June 18th, this newspaper published a letter from the Beijing Paper Mill regarding the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau's handling of the factory's external sewer project, which resulted in a waste of state property due to design errors. This has aroused close attention from responsible comrades and engineering personnel from both the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau and the Beijing Paper Mill. Relevant leading organs have also conducted strict ideological inspections on this matter. Both parties involved in this project have further conducted self-criticisms. Now, we are publishing the letters of self-criticism from both parties. The report from the Central Ministry of Light Industry to the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee regarding this matter is also very educational, so it is being published as well.
    From this inspection, it can be seen that the errors in the design of the external sewer project for the Beijing Paper Mill were the responsibility of both the client and the designer, but the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau should bear more responsibility.
    The duties of our country's engineering design institutions and their staff in design work are different from those of design companies in capitalist countries. They cannot simply rely on informal materials provided by the client to carry out design; nor can they carry out design based on the form of some seemingly formal materials. The designer has the responsibility to investigate and research whether the data on which the design is based is correct, and to sign a design contract with the client according to certain procedures. The Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau did not fulfill its due responsibilities as a designer when handling the design of the external sewer project for the Beijing Paper Mill because it did not obtain a formal application from the factory (the Central Ministry of Light Industry's official letter can only be regarded as a general request), and it did not seriously investigate the factory's wastewater volume. This lesson should be heeded by all state engineering design institutions and their staff. In New China, all private capitalist design institutions and their staff should also raise their level of understanding a step further.
    In terms of entrusting design, one cannot be careless either. It is necessary to responsibly provide detailed data required for design, clearly define the design tasks, sign a formal design contract with the entrusted party, and supervise the execution of the contract. The Beijing Paper Mill's request for the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau to handle the sewer project design was only a general request, and it did not formally submit an application or responsibly provide accurate figures for wastewater volume, which also means it did not fulfill its due responsibilities. This example should serve as a lesson for national state-owned enterprises when submitting design tasks and entrusting design work.
    I. Letter from Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau
    To the Editors:
    Since the People's Daily has continuously reported materials on construction projects in various places suffering losses due to incomplete designs and published editorials, it has further aroused our vigilance. There are also many problems in the projects we have constructed, and we are prepared to conduct a comprehensive inspection in accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial and the recent instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Committee.
    The letter published in the People's Daily on June 18 regarding the problem of the new sewer for the Beijing Paper Mill not having sufficient drainage capacity is a very good education for us. We discovered in March of this year that the factory's sewer could not accommodate all the wastewater and immediately began research. The process was as follows:
    In early April of last year, after receiving instructions from the Municipal People's Government regarding the incident of wastewater from the Beijing Paper Mill damaging farmland and polluting well water, we felt that it was difficult to implement because it was beyond our bureau's annual plan and construction capacity. Subsequently, Factory Director Shen of the factory personally came to our bureau to apply for assistance in the aftermath. Bureau Chiefs Cao Yanxing and Chen Mingshao immediately went to the site to understand the situation, and then sent engineers to conduct on-site surveys. Based on the survey results, a preliminary plan was proposed to discharge the factory's wastewater. Because our bureau was a newly established organization with extremely heavy engineering tasks, we could not spare enough manpower, and because the funds for the factory's sewer construction had not yet been determined, we could not design and construct immediately. In early September, most of our bureau's major projects were completed, and manpower could be spared, so we immediately sent engineers Liu Xunjing, He Qixiang, and others to measure the terrain and determine the route for the sewer construction, and inquired about the factory's drainage situation from engineer Xu Tianlun of the paper mill. According to him, the factory's wastewater volume was 3,000 tons per 24 hours. Engineer Liu Xunjing and others designed the sewer based on the above materials. The route direction of the sewer was not a problem, but there was no accurate investigation and research on the accurate wastewater volume and the chemical properties of the wastewater (whether it would corrode the pipe walls). It was a negligence to design based solely on the materials provided by engineer Xu Tianlun of the paper mill, Factory Director Shen, and the official letter from the Central Ministry of Light Industry stating the wastewater volume as 3,000 tons, without conducting an actual investigation. If calculated according to a daily discharge of 3,000 tons of wastewater, a 35 cm diameter sewer would be sufficient. For safety reasons, a safety factor of three was used, and the design was for a 50 cm diameter sewer with a 1/1000 slope, estimated to cost 180,000 catties of rice. However, due to the budget constraints of the factory, it was changed to a 40 cm diameter sewer with a 1/1000 slope, so the safety factor was still 1.5, and it was no problem to discharge 3,000 tons of wastewater. Our biggest shortcoming in this regard was that after the design was determined, we did not discuss it in detail with the paper mill to solicit opinions, nor did we sign any letter of authorization or construction contract. We only sent a design drawing and a budget, and started construction on October 20, completing the entire project by November 10. However, after completion, it could not fully accommodate the factory's actual wastewater volume of nearly 6,000 tons. In addition to most of the wastewater being discharged through the sewer, some wastewater inevitably flowed south from the paper mill along the terrain to the farmland.
    Our bureau is a government agency responsible for managing and constructing sewers. We should bear full responsibility for the loss caused by not conducting in-depth investigations and research for this project, resulting in a design that does not meet the actual needs, and we should conduct a deep inspection. First of all, our sense of responsibility for this project was too poor. The Beijing Paper Mill is a state-owned enterprise, and its discharged wastewater damages farmland and affects the lives of farmers, so it should be given the utmost attention. However, we did not conduct precise investigation and research on the key issue – wastewater volume – before starting construction, resulting in a sewer built with more than 130,000 catties of rice being impractical, and allowing sewage to continue to harm farmland. This is something we should be condemned for. Secondly, our bureau's leadership and engineers lacked experience in building sewer projects, resulting in a hasty determination of the design without properly considering the wastewater volume figures, exposing a careless work style. Third, we lack an economic accounting system for each project; there is no relatively complete system for design and construction, especially for projects undertaken on behalf of other units, there are no formal and strict procedures such as signing letters of authorization and construction contracts, and everything is based on verbal agreements. This is the main reason for the careless work style in design and construction. Fourth, because we were a newly established agency in the past year, there were many tasks and few people. We accepted work tasks first and then looked for people. Most of the technical cadres came from all over the place, did not understand the situation, and had to complete tasks quickly, resulting in hasty designs and hasty construction. In addition, leading cadres lacked supervision and inspection, so it was inevitable that work losses would occur.
    The above is the main reason for the loss caused by the Beijing Paper Mill's sewer. When the People's Daily reported this incident, we could not understand it ideologically. On the surface, we agreed with the principles of inspecting engineering designs proposed by the People's Daily and the Central Financial and Economic Committee, but we resisted it in our minds and failed to use this principle to inspect our own work. We also inspect this incorrect attitude together here.
    Finally, in order to completely solve the problem of wastewater discharge from the paper mill and eliminate the disaster of paper mill wastewater to farmland, in the absence of a determined sewer plan for the eastern suburban industrial zone, our opinion is: to take out the pipes buried last year, depreciate them, and have our bureau purchase them, and bury a 70 cm diameter sewer pipe on the original line without concrete foundation under the pipe, which can reduce expenses.
    This proposal is currently being negotiated with the factory. Details will be reported later.
    Sincerely,
                     Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau, June 28
        II. Letter from Beijing Paper Mill
    To the Editors:
    In the People's Daily on June 18, we criticized the Beijing Sanitation Engineering Bureau for the failure of our Beijing Paper Mill's external sewer project. Now, regarding the responsibilities that our factory should bear in the lessons learned from the failure of this project, we make the following inspection:
    1. In early April and early June of 1950, our factory and the Central Ministry of Light Industry successively raised the issue with the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, explaining the severity of the sewage harming farmland and requesting their assistance in solving it. The letters to the Sanitation Engineering Bureau did not mention the water volume, but the official letter from the Central Ministry of Light Industry to the Municipal People's Government, in order to illustrate the urgency of the matter, incidentally mentioned the then flow rate, saying it was as much as "2,000 to 3,000 tons." After the Sanitation Engineering Bureau began designing on behalf of our factory, we failed to proactively notify the other party in writing of our factory's sewage situation and possible development as a basis for their design. As a result, they mistakenly used the initially incidentally mentioned current flow rate as the basis for their design, which failed to meet the actual needs.
    2. During the design process, the factory's leadership only allowed the factory's project personnel to verbally negotiate with the other party's staff; when reviewing the Sanitation Engineering Bureau's design drawings after the design was completed, they only used the figures obtained from such informal negotiations as a basis. At that time, they failed to formally request the Sanitation Engineering Bureau to explain whether the drainage capacity determined by the design drawings met the current and future needs of our factory.
    3. Before the bureau started construction, they failed to clearly complete contract or agreement procedures with them. During the construction period, they also failed to seriously supervise the progress of the project. After the construction was completed, they failed to go through normal acceptance procedures, resulting in the sewer project not meeting the implementation requirements and failing to point out and correct it in time. After the problem of poor drainage occurred, we failed to formally negotiate with the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, but only invited the original construction personnel sent by the bureau to study solutions. As a result, the construction personnel believed that the "sewer had sunk," and we failed to conduct in-depth research and allowed them to blindly carry out repairs, wasting more than 10 million yuan of the people's wealth. As for the fact that the sewer had not been able to completely discharge all the sewage from the beginning, it took several months to completely clarify.
    The above three points fully demonstrate the careless attitude we showed in the sewer project. In this project, mainly because we thought ideologically that this project had been given to the Sanitation Engineering Bureau, we only needed to prepare the necessary funds and that would be the full extent of our responsibility for this project. Therefore, we completely let the other party handle the design and construction process with full authority. This fully illustrates our bureaucratic work style and indifferent attitude towards the people's cause. This should be inspected.
    We are prepared to conduct in-depth work inspections and ideological inspections on past and present capital construction projects in accordance with the spirit of the government's call, and use them as lessons for the future, so that all simple task viewpoints and employment viewpoints, as well as other ideological styles that new socialist engineering personnel should not have, can be inspected and resolutely removed. Doing so is necessary and of great significance.
                                                  Beijing Paper Mill
                                   June 21, 1951
            III. Report from the Ministry of Light Industry to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council
    According to a self-criticism sent by the Beijing Paper Mill regarding the failure of the factory's external sewer project. Our ministry basically agrees with this self-criticism. But this is only a preliminary self-criticism, and the ideological roots need to be further excavated. Our ministry's Paper Industry Management Department has also issued a notice on June 23, instructing all directly affiliated paper mills and managed mills to study the People's Daily's June 16 editorial "Without Correct Engineering Design, Construction is Impossible," and to deeply inspect the engineering plans and designs that have been started and not started in conjunction with the second quarter work summary, and to inspect the shortcomings in the work.
    The failure of the Beijing Paper Mill's external sewer project also reveals many shortcomings in our ministry's work system and work style. These shortcomings cannot be simply attributed to objective conditions such as a small number of personnel, lack of specialized technical personnel, and insufficient experience. Based on a simple task viewpoint, there is no strict review and inspection system, so many tasks are passive. Failures to correct the deviations that occur in each factory in a timely and appropriate manner. Due to the failure of this project, our ministry should improve its work methods and formulate various work standards for capital construction, such as design standards, review and inspection methods, and project acceptance standards. Although a complete set of systems for capital construction project implementation methods has been established this year, it is still not done enough to strengthen and correctly implement it. It should still be deeply concerned.
                              Minister of Light Industry Huang Yanpei
                          Deputy Ministers Yang Weiyu, Gong Yinbing, Wang Xinyuan
                                     June 28, 1951

    北京市卫生工程局和北京造纸厂
    关于下水道工程发生错误的检讨
    双方均有责任，卫生工程局责任较多
    中央轻工业部对此亦进行了自我批评
    编者按：六月十八日本报发表北京造纸厂关于北京市卫生工程局经办该厂厂外下水道工程因设计错误造成浪费国家财产的来函以后，曾引起了北京市卫生工程局与北京造纸厂双方负责同志及工程人员的密切注意，有关领导机关对这一事件并作了严格的思想检查。这一个工程有关的双方亦均进一步作了检讨。现在，把双方的检讨信加以公布。中央轻工业部为此事给政务院财政经济委员会的报告，也很有教育意义，故一并加以发表。
    从这次检讨中可以看出，北京造纸厂厂外下水道工程设计的错误，委托者与设计者双方都有责任，而北京市卫生工程局则应负较多的责任。
    我们国家的工程设计机构及其工作人员在设计工作上的职责，不同于资本主义国家的设计公司，它不能仅简单地依据委托者非正式提供的材料，进行设计；也不能根据表面上有某些正式材料的形式，就进行设计。设计者对设计时所依据的资料是否正确，有责任加以调查研究；并依据一定的手续与委托者订立设计合同。北京市卫生工程局在经办北京造纸厂厂外下水道工程设计时，没有得到该厂的正式申请书（中央轻工业部的公函只能视为一般的请求），对该厂的废水量没有认真地进行过调查研究，就是未尽到设计工作者应有的职责。这一教训，应当引起一切国家工程设计机构及其工作人员的注意。在新中国，一切私营的资本主义性质的设计机构及其工作人员，也应把自己的认识水平提高一步。
    在委托设计的方面，也不能马虎从事，必须负责地提出设计时所需要的详细资料，明确地规定设计任务，与被委托者订立正式的设计合同并监督合同的执行。北京造纸厂请求北京市卫生工程局经办下水道的工程设计，只是做了一般的请求而没有正式办理申请书和负责地提出废水量的正确数字，也是未尽到其应有的职责。这一事例，应当作为全国国营企业在提出设计任务与委托设计工作时的教训。
    一、北京市卫生工程局来信编辑同志：
    自从人民日报连续报道了各地建筑工程因设计不周密而遭受损失的材料并发表社论后，已经进一步引起了我们的警惕；在我们所修建的工程中也存在着很多问题，我们准备根据人民日报社论的精神和最近中央财政经济委员会的指示，作一次全面检查。
    六月十八日人民日报登载的关于北京造纸厂新建下水道不够排水量的问题的信件，对我们更是一个很好的教育；今年三月间我们发现该厂下水道不能容纳全部废水后，当即进行研究。经过是这样：
    去年四月初，接到市人民政府关于解决北京造纸厂废水损害农田浸污井水事件的指示后，在执行上因超出我局年度计划和施工能力之外，深感困难。继由该厂沈厂长亲来我局申请协助善后。我局曹言行、陈明绍两局长当即亲往该处了解情况，继又派工程师前去实地勘查；根据勘查结果，初步提出了排泄该厂废水的办法。由于我局是新成立的机构，工程任务又极繁重，抽不出足够的人力，加上该厂修建下水道的经费尚未确定，故未能即时设计施工。九月初，我局主要工程大部竣工，人力尚可兼顾，乃即派工程师刘训经、何其祥等前往测量地形，确定了修建下水道的路线，并询明了造纸厂徐天伦工程师该厂排水情形，据称：该厂工作二十四小时废水量为三千吨；刘训经工程师等即根据以上材料进行设计。下水道的路线方向是没有问题的，但对于造纸厂的准确废水量和废水的化学性能（是否浸蚀管壁）则无精确调查研究。仅根据该造纸厂徐天伦工程师和沈厂长及中央轻工业部公函中所提废水量为三千吨之材料，而未进行实际调查即行设计，这是一个疏忽。若按每日宣泄三千吨废水，则三十五公分管径的下水道是能够用，为安全起见，曾用了安全系数三倍，设计为五十公分管径千分之一坡度，计共需工程费十八万斤米；但因受该厂预算经费限制，又改为四十公分管径千分之一坡度，这样安全系数尚为一点五倍，宣泄三千吨废水是不成问题的。在这方面我们最大的缺点是：设计确定后，并没有和造纸厂详细讨论征求意见，亦未签订任何委托书或修建合同，仅送去设计图一张及预算书一份，即于十月二十日开始施工，至十一月十日全部工程竣工。但竣工后不能全部容纳该厂实际近六千吨的废水，除大部可由下水道排出外，一部分废水就无可避免地沿地势自造纸厂向南漫流于农田。
    我局是一个负责管理和建设下水道的政府机关，我们对于这项工程由于不深入调查研究，致设计不切合实际而造成的损失，是应负完全责任的，并应该进行深刻检讨。首先就是我们对这个工程的责任心太差。北京造纸厂既是国家企业，而其排出的废水又损害农田影响农民生活，应予最大注意；但我们却对问题的关键——废水量，未精确调查研究，即行施工，致使以十三万多斤米修建的下水道不符实用；并使污水继续为害于农田，这是我们应该受到谴责的。其次，是我局领导上和工程师对建筑下水道工程的经验还不够，致未很好考虑废水量数字，即仓促确定设计，工作上暴露了粗枝大叶的作风。第三、我们对每一个工程缺乏经济核算制；在设计施工上也没有一套比较完善的制度，特别是代办其他单位的工程既没有签订委托书、承修合同等正规而严密的手续，也无审核制度，只是以口头为凭，这是形成设计施工上粗枝大叶作风的主要原因。第四、是我们过去一年中由于是新建的机关，事多人少，先接受工作任务后找人，技术干部大部都是来自各方，既不了解情况，又要很快完成任务，急促设计，急促施工，加上领导干部缺乏督促检查自难免造成工作的损失。
    以上所述，是北京造纸厂下水道造成了损失的主因。当人民日报报道这一事件时，我们思想上还搞不通，表面上赞成人民日报和中央财政经济委员会提出的关于检查工程设计的原则，但思想上有些抗拒未能用这个原则来检讨自己的工作，这种不正确的态度，我们也于此一并检讨。
    最后，为了全部解决造纸厂废水排泄问题，免除造纸废水对农田的灾害，在目前东郊工业区下水道计划尚未确定的情况下，我们意见：将去年埋设之管道取出，折旧后由我局收买，在原线上，埋设七十公分管径下水道一条，管道下不打混凝土基础，这样即可减少经费的开支。
    此一提议正与该厂商洽办理中。详情容后报告。
    顺致敬礼！
                     北京市人民政府卫生工程局  六月二十八日
        二、北京造纸厂的来信编辑同志：
    在六月十八日的人民日报上，我们曾将我们北京造纸厂厂外下水道工程失败的事件，对北京卫生工程局提出了批评，现在就这件工程失败的教训中，我们厂的方面应负的责任，作如下的检讨：
    一、一九五○年四月初以及六月初，我厂及中央轻工业部曾先后向卫生工程局提出问题，说明污水危害农田的严重性，并要求他们协助解决。在给卫生工程局的信上未谈及水量，但中央轻工业部给市人民政府的公函上，为了说明事情迫待解决，曾附带提及当时的流水量，说有“二、三千吨之巨”。俟卫生工程局开始代我厂设计后，我们没能主动地把我厂的下水情况和可能发展的情况，正式以书面通知对方做他们设计的依据。以致他们误将最初附带提及的当时流水量做为他们的设计依据，遂未能与实际需要相符合。
    二、在设计过程中，厂的领导方面仅听由厂内主办工程人员和对方工作人员口头商洽；当设计完后，审核卫生工程局的设计图时，仅根据这样非正式地商洽所得的数字做为依据，当时竟没能正式向卫生工程局要求说明该项设计图所定的排水能力，是否符合我厂现在和将来的需要。
    三、在该局施工前没能和他们明确地办理合同或契约手续。在施工期间，也没能认真监督工程的进行，施工完了后，更没能经过正常验收手续，以致该下水道的工程和实施要求不相符合，没能及时指出纠正；排水不畅的问题发生后，我们没能正式向卫生工程局提出交涉，只是邀请该局所派的原施工负责人员来研究解决办法，结果该施工人员认为“水道下陷”，我们没能深入研究，又听任他盲目地进行修理，又虚耗了人民财富逾一千万元。至于该下水道自开始就没能完全排除全部污水的事实，迟迟到几个月以后才彻底搞清楚。
    以上三点，充分表现了我们在下水道工程上所表现的马虎态度。在这项工程上，主要是因为我们在思想上认为这个工程已给卫生工程局，我们只须准备好必需的款项，就算对这一工程尽了全部责任，所以才会在这一工程的设计和施工过程中，完全放任对方全权办理。这就充分说明了我们的官僚主义作风和对人民事业的漠不关心的态度。这是应该加以检讨的。
    我们准备根据政府号召的精神，对过去和现在的基本建设工程，再作深入的工作检查和思想检讨，并引以为今后的教训，务使一切单纯的任务观点及雇佣观点，以及其他新社会工程人员不应有的思想作风，都能检查出来，并且坚决去掉它。这样做是必要的也是具有重大意义的。
                                                  北京造纸厂
                                   一九五一年六月二十一日
            三、轻工业部给政务院财政经济委员会的报告
    兹据北京造纸厂送来关于该厂厂外下水道工程的失败检讨一份。我部基本上同意这一检讨。但这只是初步的检讨，尚待深入挖掘思想根源。我部造纸工业管理处也已经于六月二十三日发出通知，指示各直属造纸厂及托管厂学习人民日报六月十六日《没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工》的社论，并结合第二季工作总结，深入检查已开工未开工的工程计划和设计及检讨工作中的缺点。
    北京造纸厂厂外下水道工程的失败，我部的工作制度和工作作风上也存在着不少缺点，这些缺点不能单纯推诿于人员少，没有专门技术人员，和经验不足等的客观条件上。基于单纯的任务观点，没有严密的审核和检查制度，因此很多的工作都表现被动。不能及时地适当地纠正各厂发生的偏向。由于此次工程的失败，我部应改善工作方法及制定基本建设的各种工作标准，如设计标准、审查及检查工作办法、工程验收标准等。本年虽已定出一整套的基本建设工程进行办法方面的制度，但如何加强和如何正确的执行方面，还是做得不够。还是应该引起深切注意的。
