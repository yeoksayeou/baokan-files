　　People from All Circles in Beijing Formulate Specific Plans
　  To Conscientiously Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Martyrs and Servicemen
    [Our Newspaper's News] In response to the call of the China Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, people from all walks of life in Beijing have formulated covenants or plans to support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and servicemen, and conscientiously give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and servicemen. In addition to incorporating the work of receiving soldiers and families of martyrs and servicemen into the covenant of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families, the staff of Beijing Railway Station have also organized a comfort team to welcome and comfort injured and sick soldiers passing by at any time. After discussion at a meeting, 47 barbershops in the Seventh District decided to give families of martyrs and servicemen a 20% discount on haircuts. Dachen Mill in Xibanqiao also formulated measures to give preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen: the 40 poor families of martyrs and servicemen in the jurisdiction of this police station will be charged at cost price for flour, with 80 to 100 yuan less per catty for refined grains and 50 to 80 yuan less per catty for coarse grains. Thirty-one representatives from the industrial and commercial, medical, and film sectors of the Fifth District, as well as representatives from various government agencies and organizations, and directors of the Resist America and Aid Korea committees of various police stations, gathered on the 6th of this month to discuss the issue of giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen. Dr. Lu Kejie from the medical community said: "There are 73 families of martyrs and servicemen in this district who suffer from chronic diseases and need treatment. I am willing to initiate a campaign among Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in the district to take on this glorious task." Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners Wang Shaolan and Zhao Bingnan immediately responded, offering to provide free diagnosis and treatment to the sick families of martyrs and servicemen. Cui Xingzhou, manager of Tianzenghou Flour Mill, expressed his willingness to sell grain to families of martyrs and servicemen at wholesale prices. Liu Fanmin, a cadre of the District Cooperative, said: "In the future, when we distribute goods on the streets, we will give priority to taking care of the families of martyrs and servicemen; and we will mobilize the families of martyrs and servicemen to join the cooperative so that they can enjoy low-priced distribution." Cleaning team leader Zhang Shichang proposed mobilizing all team members to help the families of martyrs and servicemen who have no labor force to carry soil. When the families of martyrs and servicemen need vehicles to transport goods, he is willing to help them without compensation. Zhang Dehua Clinic in Guang'anmennei, Eighth District, recently revised its patriotic covenant, adding a clause on giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen, and sent 50 free outpatient vouchers to the police station, asking the police station to forward them to the families of martyrs and servicemen. He said: "I show my respect and preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and servicemen by treating their illnesses." The city's Film Industry Association has made a resolution: each theater will screen a morning movie once a month, providing free preferential treatment to military families and families of martyrs.
