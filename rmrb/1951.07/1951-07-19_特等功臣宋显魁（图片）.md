(Seven) Time bombs have the potential to explode at any moment, and those who move the bombs must be prepared to sacrifice themselves at any time. Song Xiankui thought to himself: If the bridge is not repaired, the victory at the front will be affected. I am a Communist Party member and also the chairman of the labor union, so I should take the lead. So he was the first to step forward and respond to the call.

(Eight) Workers Ji Guocheng, Zhu Yunfeng, Ma Shuzhen, and squad leader Guo Yunfa also followed suit and requested to participate. They ran up to the time bomb and first used thick hemp ropes to tie it, but the ropes broke as soon as they were pulled; they quickly switched to iron ropes, tying them to the iron rings on the bomb's tail fins used for the parachute.

(Nine) Immediately, more than thirty workers grabbed the iron ropes, took big strides, and pulled the one-ton time bomb towards the river滩 more than three hundred meters away from the iron bridge.

    （七）定时炸弹有随时爆炸的可能，移炸弹的人要随时准备牺牲。宋显魁心里想：桥不修好，前方的胜利会受到影响。我是个共产党员，又是工会主席，我时候应该起带头作用。于是他首先站出来响应号召。
    （八）工人吉国城、朱云峰、马树珍和中队长郭云发，也紧跟着要求参加。他们跑到定时炸弹的跟前，先是用粗麻绳拴，一拉就断了；紧忙又改用铁绳，拴住炸弹尾翅上系降落伞的铁环子。
    （九）马上就有三十多个工人，抢着抓起铁绳，迈开大步，拉着一顿重的定时炸弹，朝着离铁桥三百多公尺以外的河滩跑去。
