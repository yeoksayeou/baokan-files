　　Hengyang Railway Bureau Zhuzhou Railway Factory
    A Major Accident at the Zhuzhou Railway Factory: Sixty-Two Workers Poisoned
    The responsible cadres of the factory should seriously investigate the cause of the accident and determine practical improvement measures.
    To the Editor:
    The copper melting furnace in the casting workshop of the Zhuzhou Railway Factory of the Hengyang Railway Bureau was not equipped with smoke exhaust equipment. On April 18th, when copper was being melted, toxic gas and smoke spewed from the furnace, engulfing the entire workshop and causing a serious accident in which all sixty-two workers were poisoned.
    The Zhuzhou Railway Factory does not have a formal copper workshop. In the past, copper was always melted in the open air. On April 18th, it rained, and copper could not be melted outdoors. Some workers then suggested to Zhu Qinsheng, the deputy director of the factory, that copper be melted indoors. This suggestion was approved. Locomotive group workers Hu Zhongxiong, Liang Shouliang, Yuan Qingquan and others opposed this suggestion, saying that melting copper indoors would cause poisoning. However, Zhu Qinsheng did not consider the workers' opinions and decided to melt copper indoors anyway. After the copper melting work began, smoke and toxic gas spewing from the furnace engulfed the entire workshop, making it impossible to see people a few steps away. In the afternoon, many workers said they couldn't stand it anymore and worried about getting sick, but because the task was important, they persisted in their work. The leading cadres on the scene did not pay attention to this serious situation, resulting in all sixty-two workers in the workshop being poisoned. Sun Yuguo, Wang Lilin, and Zhao Jinshan were the most severely poisoned. They suffered from body aches, chest pains, numbness in their hands and feet, chills and fever, and even vomited blood.
    It can be said that this accident was entirely man-made. The factory needs to melt ten tons of copper every month, requiring eight or nine furnace firings. To protect the health of workers and carry out safe production, a workshop should have been built long ago. However, the leading cadres have not paid attention to this important issue. At the beginning of March this year, the workers melted copper in the rain, which was very difficult. The copper produced was of poor quality due to the low temperature. On another occasion, the wind blew the fire out of the copper package, burning worker Zhang Bingzhao. Therefore, the workers repeatedly requested to build a shed. Although the factory director had agreed, the engineering section delayed execution. Only after this accident occurred more than ten days later was a shed hastily built, supported by four pillars, which was not very stable. The smoke spewing out during copper melting was unable to rise due to the obstruction of the shed roof. When the wind blew, the smoke still filled the top of the shed, which was actually still very unsafe. A worker poisoning accident had already occurred when copper was melted last June, but the leading cadres did not learn from the lessons, which led to this serious accident of sixty-two people being poisoned.
    The factory's leading cadres do not pay attention to labor protection and do not provide technical safety education to the workers. A series of accidents have occurred in the past. For example, the oxygen plant did not build a storage room for finished products, and the finished products were placed in the open air, which was very unsafe. The workers repeatedly requested to build a shed, but the factory's leading cadres never resolved it. Recently, because the oxygen cylinders had been exposed to the sun for too long, the safety valve of one cylinder was blown off, almost causing an explosion. The power plant handed over the crane to an inexperienced apprentice to operate, damaging the wall and almost causing a major accident. The iron melting furnace platform was not equipped with railings. On May 15th, worker Jiang Wenbo fell from the platform and was injured. Similar accidents have occurred constantly.
    The factory's trade union organization is unsound, and counter-revolutionaries have taken the opportunity to infiltrate (the factory's trade union labor protection committee member Li Jiesheng is a counter-revolutionary and has been detained). Some trade union cadres also do not pay attention to labor protection, which is also an important reason for these accidents. The factory's safety and health committee has never been organized. For more than a year, the trade union has not done anything to protect workers' health. The Zhuzhou Railway Factory is a large factory with good machinery and workshops, but it lacks the necessary safety equipment. The workers have repeatedly reported this problem to the trade union, but it has been ignored.
    The local railway work area trade union committee has conducted a detailed investigation into the cause and responsibility for this accident, studied the handling opinions and future improvement measures, and promptly notified all levels of subordinate trade unions to learn from it, requiring trade union cadres at all levels to recognize the seriousness of this issue, thoroughly inspect their labor protection work, summarize experience, correct shortcomings, and strive to implement the interim regulations on safety and hygiene.

        Reader Du Jingzhao, Zhao Zhenqiu
    Editor's Note: The administrative and trade union leading cadres of the Zhuzhou Railway Factory disregard the factory's safety equipment and safety education, and treat workers' lives and the country's production tasks as child's play, which is absolutely not allowed. The factory's leading cadres should seriously examine this issue and develop practical improvement measures. We hope that employees in various places will resolutely expose and criticize similar situations.

　　衡阳铁路管理局株州铁路工厂
    发生六十二位工友中毒的重大事故
    该厂负责干部应认真追查肇事原因，定出切实改进办法。编辑同志：
    衡阳铁路管理局株州铁路工厂铸工场的化铜炉，未安装排烟设备，在四月十八日化铜时，从炉中喷出的有毒气体和烟尘迷漫全场，造成六十二位工友全数中毒的严重事故。
    株州铁路工厂没有正式的铜工房，过去都是在室外空地上化铜。四月十八日下了雨，不能在露天下化铜。有些工友遂向该场副主任诸琴生提出在屋子里化铜的建议，这个建议被批准了。机车组工友胡仲雄、梁守良、袁庆泉等反对这个建议，他们说，在室内化铜会中毒。但是，诸琴生并不考虑工人的意见，仍决定在屋子里化铜。化铜工作开始后，从炉中喷出来的烟雾毒气迷漫全场，几步之外就看不清人。到了下午，很多工人都说受不了，耽心要生病，但因任务重要，仍然坚持工作。现场领导干部对这种严重情况并未重视，以致全场六十二位工友都中了毒。孙玉国、王礼林、赵金山三工友中毒最重，他们全身酸疼，胸口刺痛，手足发麻，发冷发热，以至吐血。
    这次事故可以说完全是人为的。该场每月需化铜十吨，要开八、九次炉。为了保护工人健康，进行安全生产，早该建立工房。但领导干部对于这个重要问题，一直不加重视。今年三月初，工友们曾经冒雨化铜，非常艰苦。化出的铜因温度不高而质量不好。另一次因为刮风，将铜包子中的火刮出来，烧伤工友张炳兆。因此，工友们一再要求搭棚子。厂长虽已同意，但工务科延不执行，直到这次事故发生十多天后，才马马虎虎地搭了一个棚子，四柱支一顶，很不牢固。化铜时喷出来的烟雾，因受棚顶阻碍不能上升。刮风时烟雾仍充满工棚棚顶，实际上还是很不安全。去年六月化铜时，已经发生过工友中毒事故，但领导干部并未记取教训，以致发生了这次六十二人中毒的严重事故。
    该厂领导干部不重视劳动保护，不对工友进行技术安全教育，过去就曾发生过一连串的事故。如氧气场未建造储品间，成品露天放置，很不安全。工友几次要求搭棚子，该厂领导干部始终未解决。最近因为氧气瓶露天放晒太久，有一个瓶子的保险嘴被冲掉，差点发生爆炸事故。动力场把吊车交给一个技术不熟练的学徒工去操作，碰坏墙壁，差点造成重大事故。化铁炉平台，因未装设栏杆，五月十五日，工友蒋文伯从台上掉下来跌伤。类似这样的事故曾不断发生。
    该厂工会组织不健全，反革命分子乘机钻入（该厂工会劳保委员李杰生就是反革命分子，现已被扣押），某些工会干部也不重视劳动保护，也是造成这些事故的重要原因。该厂安全卫生委员会始终没组织起来，一年多以来，工会在保护工人健康方面没做过什么事。株州铁路工厂是一个大厂子，机器厂房都很好，但是却没有必要的安全设备。工人再三向工会反映这个问题，仍然置之不理。
    当地铁路工区工会委员会对这次事故发生的原因和责任，已作了详尽的调查，研究了处理意见及今后的改进办法；并已及时通报所属各级工会引为教训，要求各级工会干部认识这个问题的严重性，深入检查自己的劳动保护工作，总结经验，纠正缺点，为贯彻实行安全卫生暂行条例而奋斗。
        读者  杜景沼、赵振球      
    编者按：株州铁路工厂的行政和工会的领导干部，忽视工厂的安全设备和安全教育，以工人的生命为儿戏，以国家的生产任务为儿戏，这是绝不能允许的。该厂领导干部对于这个问题，应该认真检查，并定出切实的改进办法。希望各地职工对类似情况，进行坚决的揭发和批评。
