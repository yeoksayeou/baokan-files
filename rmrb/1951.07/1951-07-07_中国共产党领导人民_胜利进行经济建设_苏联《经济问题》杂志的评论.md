Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th. The Soviet magazine "Economic Issues," recently published its sixth issue, featuring an article by Astafyev titled "The Chinese Communist Party's Struggle to Eliminate Economic Backwardness and Industrialize the Country," spanning over ten thousand words. The article points out that the Chinese Communist Party is "the organizer and leader of the Chinese people's historic victories on all fronts—military, political, and economic." Based on the works of Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Ren Bishi, and others, as well as the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and based on an analysis of China's economic situation, the article elaborates on the Chinese Communist Party's correct economic policies and the victories already achieved on the economic front. The article concludes: "The tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the short period since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in the restoration and construction of industry, powerfully demonstrate that the program of China's industrialization put forward by the Chinese Communist Party will be successfully realized with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The attempts of American imperialism and its puppets to sabotage the peaceful economic construction of the People's Republic of China will be bankrupt in the face of the firm will of the great Chinese people and the people of the world to defend peace and shatter the sinister plans of the instigators of a new war."

    苏联《经济问题》杂志的评论
    【新华社莫斯科六日电】最近出版的苏联《经济问题》杂志第六期，发表了阿斯塔费耶夫所著题为“为消灭经济落后、为国家工业化而斗争的中国共产党”的论文，长达万余言。论文指出：中国共产党是“中国人民在各个战线——军事、政治和经济战线上有历史意义的胜利的组织者和领导者”。论文根据毛泽东、刘少奇、任弼时等同志的著作和中国人民政协共同纲领，根据对中国经济情况的分析，阐述了中国共产党的正确的经济政策和业已获得的经济战线上的胜利。论文结语说：“中国人民在共产党领导下，在中华人民共和国成立后的短短期间内，在恢复和建设工业上所达到的巨大成就，有力地证明了中国共产党所提出的中国工业化的纲领，将在苏联和人民民主国家援助下顺利实现。美帝国主义及其傀儡破坏中华人民共和国和平经济建设的企图，在伟大的中国人民和全世界人民保卫和平粉碎新战争挑拨者罪恶计划的坚定意志面前，将要破产。”
