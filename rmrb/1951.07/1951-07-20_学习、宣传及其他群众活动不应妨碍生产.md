Editor's Note: The indiscriminate or frequent mobilization of the masses to participate in unnecessary activities, thereby hindering the production, work, and study of the people and causing waste of manpower and resources, is not only a phenomenon in Chongqing, Southwest China, but also occurs from time to time in other regions. We believe that no agency or organization should arbitrarily mobilize the masses for parades, propaganda, or meetings. Because the result of doing so will inevitably lead to waste of manpower and resources, and cause dissatisfaction among the masses. We are reprinting the editorial of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily here with the aim of drawing the attention of relevant departments to this issue.

　　The purpose of learning, propaganda, and other mass activities is to improve the people's political awareness and production enthusiasm, to do a good job in production, and to develop the social economy; to serve production and absolutely not to hinder production.

　　Since the liberation of Chongqing, especially after the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education movement, the city's workers, farmers, youth students, women, industrial and commercial circles, cultural circles, and other people from all walks of life have responded with great enthusiasm to every call of the government and mass organizations, launching one movement after another. In the movements of Resist America, Aid Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, land reform, etc., in participating in military cadre schools, donating money and goods to comfort the volunteers, collecting winter clothing, democratic tax assessment, signing in support of concluding a peace pact and opposing the United States arming Japan, etc., great achievements have been made. Through these movements and work, the people's political awareness has indeed been greatly improved, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of loving the motherland, loving Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, supporting the People's Government, and supporting the People's Liberation Army is widespread and very high. Ideological mobilization and preparation have been made for the arduous project of building a new Chongqing of the people's production.

　　The learning movements, propaganda, parades, and other mass activities that have been launched in the past were completely necessary, correct, and were warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses. However, if we do not cherish the enthusiasm of the masses and continue to mobilize them casually, we will inevitably reach the point of hindering production, becoming detached from the masses, and being complained about by the masses. The Chongqing Municipal Leadership issued a special instruction on March 22 to correct the practice of arbitrarily mobilizing the masses for parades, flower offerings, and flag offerings. The National Resist America, Aid Korea General Association broadcasted this instruction of the Chongqing Municipal Leadership to various places on April 2, pointing out that "the masses should not be mobilized for parades and demonstrations frequently, otherwise it will hinder the production, work, and study of the people and cause waste of manpower and resources." After April, the phenomenon of arbitrarily mobilizing and wasting manpower and resources has gradually decreased, but it has not completely stopped so far. For example, in order to carry out a traffic safety publicity campaign, the Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau, without the approval of the municipal leadership, arbitrarily issued a notice to its subordinate branches on June 13: "Mobilize all possible forces to complete this task." Starting from the 15th, publicity parades in the urban area of Chongqing started again. According to incomplete surveys and statistics: in the central urban area, there are more than 200 various propaganda teams on the streets every day, with a total of 7,478 people. Each police station also held vendor conferences, residents' representative conferences, and mobilized teachers and students of primary and secondary schools to participate in the publicity. The Cheng 1st and 2nd Sub-bureaus organized 118 traffic inspection teams, and one person was dispatched to stand guard with a small flag in front of every ten or so households on the street. According to the statistics of the Cheng 2nd Sub-bureau: a total of 184 propaganda teams, 27 waist drum teams, 25 yangko teams, 15 lotus ballad teams, and 8 singing groups were organized, and 346 mass forums of various sizes were held, with the participation of more than 45,000 people, and 25 mass parades were held, mobilizing 6,886 people. In the area under the jurisdiction of the Cheng 3rd Sub-bureau, more than 100 mass meetings of various sizes were held, with more than 13,000 people attending, and more than 3,000 people participated in street publicity. The waste of manpower and resources in just this one task is already so alarming. The publicity work of traffic safety, in a densely populated city like Chongqing, originally did not need to take such a way, and it would be enough to use radio stations and written publicity. Such a waste of manpower and resources inevitably detaches from the masses. Because it did not carefully consider its own working methods from the interests of the broad masses of the people, it was originally a good thing to publicize traffic safety and protect the safety of the people, but the result was to cause dissatisfaction among the broad masses. Some people said: "Parades can't do business, and you have to pay money, and you can't disobey the orders from above." Others said: "The parade team does not obey orders, there are waist drum teams and lotus ballad teams all over the street, and promoting traffic safety hinders traffic order instead." Isn't this a very correct criticism?

　　The Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau's behavior of arbitrarily mobilizing the masses for publicity parades is indeed not only a serious act of being unorganized and undisciplined, but also an act of being detached from the masses without taking care of the interests of the people. It must be known that only under the condition of taking care of and helping the masses in production can we truly unite, educate, and improve the masses. And what the masses are most concerned about and urgently demand is production. All work of our People's Government is for the masses, but all work must be carried out around or take care of the production of the masses. Whoever can correctly guide the masses in production and work, and help the masses solve difficulties, can truly be supported by the people, and is the most concerned about the interests of the masses. Otherwise, it will inevitably be detached from the masses. If any work cannot get the support of the masses and is detached from the masses, then any work will inevitably not be done well. We once again propose that no agency or organization should arbitrarily mobilize the masses for parades, publicity, or meetings. From now on, the mobilization of the masses must be carried out according to the system (according to the masses' own organizational system). No agency or organization can exceed its own responsibilities and scope in the matter of mobilizing the masses. For example, the mobilization of shop assistants must be done through the shop assistants' union; the mobilization of the industrial and commercial circles must be done through the preparatory committee of the Industrial and Commercial Federation. At the same time, we must also persuade the people's organizations not to hold parades casually. The practice of cultural and entertainment organizations such as yangko teams, waist drum teams, and lotus ballad teams must be strictly limited to the activity time stipulated by the People's Government (6:30 am to 7:30 am, 7:00 pm to 11:00 pm), and cannot affect production, business, urban order, and the life of residents. Otherwise, it must be resolutely corrected.

　　Secondly, the daily evening study of workers, shop assistants, and street residents (including political study and cultural study) must also strictly abide by the principle of voluntariness, and oppose any coercion and commandism and all formalism. In the past, the amateur schools that required the masses to persist in studying for four hours every day from 8:00 pm to 12:00 pm must be changed. According to a recent survey in the Third District: after the mass study time has been reduced, there are still 24 hours of study per week. Now, some shop assistants and handicraft workers in Chongqing close their shops and go to study at 7:00 pm every night. This study time is extremely inappropriate, and doing so has greatly affected production and business. If this practice and method are not immediately corrected, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences. Therefore, the mass study time must be immediately adjusted under the principle of mass voluntariness and not hindering production and business. At present, the mass study time should not exceed 24 hours per month, that is, it should not exceed six hours per week. In the future, the mass study should strive to be gradually deepened and made regular. The organization leading the study and the study time should adapt to the requirements of regular study.

　　Let us repeat again: learning, propaganda, and other mass activities must serve production and must not hinder production. We must establish the idea of centering on production among the people of all walks of life and all strata in the city. What promotes the progress of society first is production. In order to do a good job in production, we must first of all cherish the people's strength very much, and we must resolutely oppose any behavior and practice that wastes and abuses manpower and resources.

　　We hope that the Party organizations at all levels in Southwest China and the people's governments in various places should always prevent and be vigilant against all phenomena that waste the people's strength, and correct them in time. Because this phenomenon that has occurred in Chongqing City also exists in other cities, and not only in cities, but also in rural areas. In all movements and work, we must cherish the people's strength very much, and fight to resolutely oppose all tendencies to waste manpower and resources!

### 学习、宣传及其他群众活动不应妨碍生产

　　学习、宣传及其他群众活动不应妨碍生产
    编者按：随便或频繁地动员群众参加不必要的活动，因而妨碍人民群众生产、工作和学习，并造成人力物力的浪费，这不仅是西南重庆一地的现象，其他地区亦时有发生。我们认为任何机关团体决不应该随便动员群众游行、宣传和开会。因为这样作的结果，必然会引起人力物力的浪费，引起群众的不满。我们在这里转载了重庆新华日报的社论，目的是在引起各有关部门对这个问题的重视。
    学习、宣传及其他群众活动的目的是为了提高人民的政治觉悟与生产的积极性，作好生产，发展社会经济；为生产服务而绝不能妨碍生产。
    重庆解放以来，特别是在开展抗美援朝宣传教育运动以后，全市工人、农民、青年学生、妇女界、工商界、文化界及其他各界人民，以高度热情响应了政府和群众团体的每一号召，展开了一个又一个的运动。在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革等运动中，在参加军事干部学校、募捐慰劳志愿军、募集寒衣、民主评税、签名拥护缔结和平公约反对美国武装日本等运动中，都收到很大的成绩。经过这些运动和工作，人民群众的政治觉悟确实是大大提高了，热爱祖国与热爱毛主席共产党，拥护人民政府与拥护人民解放军的革命热情，是普遍而十分高涨的。为建设一个人民的生产的新重庆的艰巨工程，作了思想的动员与准备。
    过去所展开的学习运动，宣传、游行及其他群众活动，是完全必要的、正确的、并且获得了广大群众的热烈欢迎与拥护。但是，如果不珍贵群众的热情，继续随便动员，必然走到妨碍生产，脱离群众，为群众所抱怨的地步。重庆市领导机关于三月二十二日特为此发出指示，纠正随便动员群众游行、献花、献旗，全国抗美援朝总会四月二日曾将重庆市领导机关这一指示广播各地，指出“不可频繁地动员群众游行示威，否则就将妨碍人民群众的生产、工作和学习，并造成人力物力的浪费现象”。四月份以后，这种随便动员、浪费人力物力的现象已逐渐减少，但迄今并未完全停止。举例来说吧！重庆市公安局为了开展交通安全宣传运动，未经市领导机关的批准，擅自于六月十三日通令所属各分局：“发动可能发动的一切力量来完成此一任务。”从十五日开始，重庆市区内宣传游行又闹哄起来，据不完全的调查统计：市中心区每日出现街头的各色各样的宣传队共有二百余队，人数达七千四百七十八人，各派出所并先后召开摊贩大会，段上居民代表大会，并动员中小学师生参加宣传。城一、二分局组织了一一八个交通检查队，街道上每十余户门前即派一人持小旗站岗。又据城二分局统计：共组织一八四个宣传队、二十七个腰鼓队、二十五个秧歌队、十五个莲筲队、八个歌咏组，召开大小群众座谈会三四六次，参加人数四万五千余人，群众游行计有二十五次，发动人数达六千八百八十六名，在城三分局所辖地区召开大小群众会一百余次，到会群众一万三千余人，参加街道宣传的三千余人。仅仅在这一个工作，其所浪费的人力物力已经是这样的惊人了。而交通安全的宣传工作，像重庆这样人口集中的大城市，原来不必要采取那样的方式，可以利用广播电台及文字宣传就够了，这样的浪费人力物力，必然地脱离群众，由于未很好地从广大人民利益出发来考虑自己的工作方式方法，原是为了宣传交通安全与保护人民群众安全的一件好事，做的结果是招致广大群众的不满。有些群众说：“游行不能做生意，还要出钱，上面命令不能不干。”又说：“游行队伍不听指挥，腰鼓队、莲筲队满街是，宣传交通安全反而妨碍交通秩序。”这难道不是很正确的批评吗？
    重庆市公安局这种擅自动员群众宣传游行的行为，确实不仅是一种严重的无组织无纪律、又是不照顾人民群众利益而脱离群众的行为。要知道：只有在照顾与帮助群众生产的条件下，才能真正团结群众，教育与提高群众。而群众所最关心的所迫切要求的是生产。我们人民政府的一切工作都是为了群众的，然而一切工作必须围绕着或照顾到群众的生产而进行。谁能在生产与工作上，正确地指导群众，帮助群众解决困难，就真正能够为人民所拥护，就是最关心群众利益的。否则就必然地脱离群众。任何工作如果不能获得群众的支持而脱离了群众，任何工作也就必然做不好。我们再一次提出：任何机关团体不能随便动员群众游行、宣传与开会。今后动员群众必须各按系统（按照群众自己的组织系统），任何机关团体在动员群众的问题上，不能超过自己的职责与范围。例如动员店员必须经过店员工会；动员工商界必须经过工商联合会筹备委员会。同时我们也必须说服各人民团体，不应随便举行游行，秧歌队、腰鼓队、莲筲队等文化娱乐组织的练习，必须严格限制在人民政府规定的活动时间之内（早晨六时半至七时半，晚上七时至十一时），并不能影响生产、营业、城市秩序及居民的生活。否则必须坚决纠正。
    其次，工人、店员、街市居民每日晚上的学习（包括政治学习与文化学习）亦必须严格遵守自愿的原则，反对任何强迫命令和一切形式主义的作法。过去要求群众每日从晚八时到十二时坚持四小时学习的业余学校必须加以改变。最近据三区调查：群众学习时间在减少了之后，每周仍有二十四小时的学习。现在重庆市上有些商店店员与手工业工人每晚七时即关门学习去了。这种学习时间是极不恰当的，这样做已大大地影响了生产与营业，这种作法与办法如不立即加以改正，必将引致严重的恶果。因此，群众的学习时间，必须在群众自愿和不妨碍生产和营业的原则下，立刻加以调整。目前群众学习时间每月不应超过二十四小时，即每周不应超过六小时。群众的学习今后应力求逐步深入，并使之经常化。而领导学习的组织及学习时间都要适应学习经常化的要求。
    让我们再重复一句：学习、宣传、及其他群众活动，必须为生产服务而绝不能妨碍生产。我们必须在全市各界与各阶层人民中间树立以生产为中心的思想。推动社会的前进的首先就是生产。为了把生产工作做好，首先必须十分地爱惜民力，必须坚决反对任何浪费与滥用人力物力的行为与作法。
    我们希望全西南各级党的组织和各地人民政府都应该时刻防止与警惕任何浪费民力的一切现象，并及时加以纠正。因为像重庆市已发生的这种现象，其他城市也有，不仅城市有，在乡村也有。在一切运动与工作中，我们必须十分地爱惜民力，为坚决反对一切浪费人力物力的倾向而斗争！
