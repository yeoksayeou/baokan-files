　　The capital's industrial and commercial circles representatives of more than a thousand people gathered yesterday (3rd) to discuss the Korean armistice negotiations. The chairman of the meeting, Fu Huating, said in his speech: We must recognize that the current Korean armistice negotiations are because the Chinese and Korean people's heroic resistance and successive great victories have forced American imperialism and its vassal states to "retreat in the face of difficulties." However, whether the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully depends on our future efforts. Therefore, the capital's industrial and commercial circles should make persistent efforts, display greater patriotic spirit, and continue to carry out the weapon donation movement to consolidate national defense, protect the security of the motherland, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
　　Representatives of the rubber industry, Shi Yaoxian, the silk and cloth industry, Jiao Huanwu, the Xingye Company, Tang Shaoyuan, and the national medicine industry, Liu Yifeng, and 22 others, spoke enthusiastically at the meeting one after another, unanimously believing that American imperialism was forced to accept the suggestion of Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik and expressed its willingness to negotiate, which is another great victory for the peace-loving people of the world. However, whether American imperialism has the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue remains to be seen by future facts. Imperialism has always been accustomed to playing deceptive tricks. The Chinese people still have fresh memories of the historical fact that the American "envoy" Marshall used "mediation" as a pretext to actually help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang carry out the anti-people civil war. Therefore, we should be highly vigilant. Regardless of whether the Korean armistice negotiations can be held smoothly and reach an agreement, the capital's industrial and commercial circles must continue to carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and complete the weapon donation plan. This is precisely the effort that the industrial and commercial circles should make to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and consolidate the national defense of the motherland. Liu Wenjing, representative of the hardware industry, and Luo Liquan, representative of the wood industry, also guaranteed in their speeches that their respective industries would complete the weapon donation plan ahead of schedule.

　　首都工商界代表千余人集会讨论朝鲜停战谈判问题
    认为必须继续开展抗美援朝运动，完成捐献武器计划，以巩固国防，   争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    【本报讯】北京市工商界各行业代表一千余人昨（三）日集会讨论朝鲜停战谈判问题。大会主席傅华亭致词说：我们要认清目前朝鲜的停战谈判，是因为中朝人民英勇抗战，接连取得了伟大的胜利，才迫使美帝国主义及其附庸国不得不“知难而退”。但是朝鲜问题能否获得和平解决，还要看我们今后的努力。因此首都工商界应再接再厉，发挥更大的爱国主义精神，继续开展捐献武器运动，以巩固国防，保卫祖国的安全，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    橡胶业代表史耀先、绸布业代表焦寰五、兴业公司代表汤绍远和国药业代表刘一峰等二十六人，先后在会上热烈发言，一致认为美帝国主义被迫接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克的建议，并表示准备谈判，这是全世界和平人民再一次的伟大胜利。但美帝国主义究竟有无和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，还要看今后的事实才能证明。帝国主义一向惯于玩弄欺骗手段，美国“特使”马歇尔借“调处”为名，实际帮助蒋介石匪帮进行反人民内战的史实，中国人民记忆犹新。因此我们应高度警惕，不论朝鲜停战谈判能否顺利举行并达成协议，首都工商界一定要继续开展抗美援朝运动，完成捐献武器的计划。这正是工商界为争取和平解决朝鲜问题，并巩固祖国国防应有的努力途径。五金业代表刘文经和木业代表罗丽泉等在发言中，还保证本行业要提前完成捐献武器计划。
