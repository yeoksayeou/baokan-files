Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Chairman of the French Peace Council, Fajon, held a press conference on June 28th, solemnly declaring that the French people, despite the French government's ban, will continue to fight for the nationwide peace demonstration on July 15th, the "French People's Day of Struggle Against German Remilitarization and for the Conclusion of a Peace Pact Among the Five Great Powers."

According to the resolution of the National Peace Council on April 15th, a National People's Congress for the Defense of Peace will be held in Paris on July 15th, and hundreds of thousands of peace fighters from all over the country will come to Paris to participate in the congress. The campaign in France to collect signatures for the Declaration for a Peace Pact and the Protest Against Arming West Germany will reach its climax on this day. The Queuille government is extremely afraid of this movement and brazenly issued an order to ban it on June 27th.

However, this shameless act of the Queuille government was immediately met with angry rebukes from the French people. The French National Peace Council issued a communique, resolutely demanding that the Queuille government immediately revoke the ban and calling on all peace fighters and all people who uphold freedom and democracy to fiercely protest this illegal ban.

Fajon announced at the press conference on the 28th: "We will continue to prepare for July 15th. We will continue to call on all the French people in countless gatherings to demand the conclusion of a peace pact among the five great powers. We have confidence in the French people. National unity is something that the government's decision can no longer stop."

　　法和平理事会不顾政府迫害
    决如期举行和平示威
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：法国和平理事会主席法奇于六月二十八日举行记者招待会，郑重声明法国人民将不顾法国政府的禁令，继续为实现七月十五日“法国人民反对德国重新军国主义化及争取五大国缔结和平公约斗争日”的全国和平大示威而斗争。
    根据全国和平理事会四月十五日的决议，七月十五日将在巴黎举行保卫和平的全国人民代表大会，全国各地将有数十万名和平战士前来巴黎参加大会。法国为和平公约宣言与反对武装西德抗议书征集签名的运动，将在这天达到最高潮。葛义政府对这一运动极其害怕，竟于六月二十七日公然下令予以禁止。
    但是葛义政府的这种无耻行径立即受到了法国人民愤怒的反击。法国全国和平理事会发表公报，坚决要求葛义政府立即撤销禁令，并号召一切和平战士和一切拥护自由民主的人民猛烈抗议这一非法的禁令。
    法奇二十八日在记者招待会上宣布：“我们要继续准备迎接七月十五日。我们要继续号召全体法国人民在无数的集会上要求缔结五大国和平公约。我们对法国人民有信心。民族团结是政府的决定再也阻止不了的。”
