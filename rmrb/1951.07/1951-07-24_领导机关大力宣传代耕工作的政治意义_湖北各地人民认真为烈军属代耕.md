　　Leading Organs Vigorously Publicize the Political Significance of Substitute Farming Work
　  People in Various Parts of Hubei Conscientiously Perform Substitute Farming for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers

[Our Newspaper News] People in various parts of Hubei Province have achieved considerable success in substitute farming for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. In most areas, to ensure deep plowing and careful cultivation without reducing normal yields, all families of martyrs and soldiers without any labor force have been completely contracted for farming, while those with partial labor force have a portion contracted. For those with insufficient labor force or facing temporary accidents, difficulties are resolved through mutual assistance. As of now, in the province, about one-third or more of the counties, districts, and townships in each special district have implemented contract farming, work-point systems, or sub-tenancy systems for substitute farming. In areas where contract farming is implemented, a method of agreed-upon yields, signing contracts, and compensation for surpluses or deficits after the autumn harvest is generally adopted, reducing the concerns of the substitute-farmed households. Substitute farming mutual aid groups in areas where contract farming has not been implemented have also established covenants and plans to prioritize martyrs' and soldiers' families, ensuring timely planting, harvesting, and weeding to prevent crop neglect.

The reasons for achieving the above results are mainly attributed to grasping four important aspects in the substitute farming work:

(1) Leaders pay attention to and supervise inspections, changing the thinking of cadres, so that substitute farming work changes from passive to active. After the National Conference on Preferential Treatment Work in the Spring of this year, the Hubei Provincial People's Government issued instructions, pointing out that preferential treatment work is one of the most basic and urgent concrete tasks in the anti-US and aid-Korea work, calling on all regions to do a good job in spring substitute farming and lay the foundation for the whole year. Several thousand copies of the introduction to substitute farming methods in the old liberated areas of North China were reprinted and distributed to special districts, cities, counties, and districts for implementation reference. In March and April, the Hubei Provincial Department of Veterans Affairs and Preferential Treatment organized substitute farming work inspection teams and groups, which went to various special districts for inspection. At the end of April, Li Xiannian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, at the joint meeting of the CPC county secretaries of the whole province, emphasized that all regions should complete the substitute farming work as a political task. In this way, the attitude of some cadres who underestimated and delayed the substitute farming work was overcome, so that all regions generally realized the political significance of this work. The civil affairs departments of many counties have specially assigned cadres to districts, townships, and villages to check and supervise, thus making the entire substitute farming work vigorously develop.

(2) Combined with the three major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses was inspired, and the masses in various places consciously participated in the substitute farming work. Last year, because ideological education work was not carried out in various places, many people regarded substitute farming work as performing official duties and extra burdens. This spring, cadres in various places accepted this lesson and combined different movements and central work to carry out various ideological mobilizations and grievance education for the masses. Especially in the land reform, combined with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the punishment of a group of illegal landlords and counter-revolutionaries, a new atmosphere appeared in the countryside. Cadres seized this link and strengthened education and publicity, making the broad masses realize that without the People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Forces, there would be no victory of liberation today, and doing a good job in substitute farming is to defend their own fruits of victory. For example, the masses in Hongfu Township, the eighth district of Wuchang, previously believed that substitute farming work had nothing to do with them. After patriotic education in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, they organized a substitute farming team of 994 people, and included substitute farming work in the patriotic covenant, ensuring no slacking, no reduction in output, prioritizing the families of martyrs and soldiers, and achieving three plowings and four hoeings.

(3) Educate the families of martyrs and soldiers to maintain their honor and overcome the idea of simply relying on relief. This spring, the Hubei Provincial leading organs instructed various regions to hold representatives' meetings of families of martyrs and soldiers at all levels. At present, more than half of the regions have already held them. Through the representatives' meetings, the families of martyrs and soldiers have a further understanding of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and they have expressed that they cannot just live off their honor. Some have even reduced the number of acres to be substitute farmed. A military family surnamed He in Huanggang County not only did not ask for substitute farming, but also automatically helped a new military family with substitute farming. Chen Fenglin, a military family in Yingcheng, said: "My three children are fighting on the front lines of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and I must be self-reliant in production in the rear and strive to be a model."

(4) Give full play to the backbone role of Communist Youth League members, labor models, village cadres, militiamen, and members of farmers' associations. Under the influence of their exemplary actions, the broad masses were united and promoted the entire substitute farming work.

At present, there are still some problems in the substitute farming work in various parts of Hubei that need to be corrected urgently. The main points are as follows: 1. Some areas do not have enough inspection and supervision, and there is a phenomenon of formalism. Some substitute farming organizations are unsound or have no fixed organization, and the phenomenon of temporary apportionment is still common. 2. The idea of prioritizing those near and neglecting those far, prioritizing military families and neglecting martyr families, and the village-based thinking in labor burden are still common in various places in substitute farming. 3. Some areas lack ideological education, commendation, and criticism of substitute farming groups, which leads to the substitute farming work being tight at first and then loose. Some are unbalanced and unequal in labor burden. 4. Continue to educate some families of martyrs and soldiers to correct their egalitarian thinking and dependence mentality.

　　领导机关大力宣传代耕工作的政治意义
　  湖北各地人民认真为烈军属代耕
    【本报讯】湖北省各地人民为革命烈士家属和革命军人家属代耕，获得了相当成绩。大部地区，为了保证深耕细作，不降低常年产量，对全无劳动力的烈、军属已实行全部包耕，有半劳动力的即包耕一部分，对劳动力不够或发生临时事故的则以帮工互助解决困难。截至目前止，全省各专区约有三分之一以上的县、区、乡的代耕工作，已实行包耕制、工票制或出佃制。实行包耕制地区的代耕工作，一般实行了约定产量，订立合同，秋后余分亏补的办法；减除了被代耕户的顾虑。未实行包耕地区的代耕互助组，也都订立公约和计划，做到先烈、军属后自己，保证按时种、收、拔草，不荒芜庄稼。
    获得上述成绩的原因，主要是在代耕工作中抓住了四个重要环节：
    （一）领导重视并加以督促检查，扭转干部思想，使代耕工作由被动变为主动。在今春全国优抚工作座谈会后，湖北省人民政府曾发出指示，指出优抚工作是抗美援朝工作中最基本最迫切的具体任务之一，号召各地搞好春季代耕，打下全年基础。并翻印华北老区代耕方法介绍数千册，分发给各专区、市、县、区作实施参考。三、四月份湖北省荣誉军人优抚处又组织了代耕工作检查队和检查组，分赴各专区检查。四月底湖北省人民政府李先念主席在全省中共县委书记联席会议上，着重指示各地把代耕工作当作政治任务来完成。这样，就克服了部分干部对代耕工作轻视和拖延的态度，使各地普遍认识到这一工作的政治意义。很多县的民政部门都专派干部到区、乡、村检查督促，遂使整个代耕工作蓬勃开展。
    （二）结合抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动，启发了群众的爱国热情，各地群众都自觉地参加代耕工作。去年因为各地没有进行思想教育工作，不少地区的群众把代耕工作看为出公差和额外负担。今春各地干部接受了这一教训，结合不同的运动和中心工作向群众进行各种思想动员、诉苦教育，特别在土地改革中结合镇压反革命，惩处了一批不法地主和反革命分子后，农村中出现了新面貌，干部抓住了这一环节，加强教育宣传，使广大群众认识到没有人民解放军和人民公安部队就没有今天的翻身胜利，搞好代耕工作就是保卫自己的胜利果实。如武昌八区洪福乡群众以前认为代耕工作与自己无关，经过抗美援朝的爱国教育后，组织起来了九百九十四人的代耕队，并把代耕工作列入爱国公约。保证不怠工、不降低产量，先烈、军属后自己，并做到三犁四锄。
    （三）教育烈、军属保持光荣，克服单纯依赖救济的观点。今春湖北省领导机关曾指示各地逐级召开烈、军属代表会。目前已有一半以上地区，已经召开过了。通过代表会，烈、军属对抗美援朝有了进一步认识，纷纷表示不能坐吃光荣饭。有的且把代种田亩数减少。黄冈县何姓军属不但不叫代耕，而且自动帮助一家新军属代耕。应城陈风林军属说：“我三娃在抗美援朝前线作战，我在后方要自立生产，争取做模范。”
    （四）发挥青年团员、劳动模范、村干部、民兵和农会会员的骨干作用。在他们模范行动影响下，团结了广大群众推动了整个代耕工作。
    目前湖北各地代耕工作尚有一些问题，亟待注意纠正。主要有下面几点：一、部分地区检查督促做得不够，有流于形式的现象，有的代耕组织不健全或无固定组织，临时摊派现象仍普遍。二、各地在代耕上的先近后远，重军属轻烈属及劳力负担上的村本位主义思想还普遍存在。三、某些地区对代耕组的思想教育和表扬批评差，使代耕工作形成先紧后松，有的在劳力负担上不平衡、不等价。四、对部分烈、军属继续教育，纠正他们的平均思想和依赖观点。
