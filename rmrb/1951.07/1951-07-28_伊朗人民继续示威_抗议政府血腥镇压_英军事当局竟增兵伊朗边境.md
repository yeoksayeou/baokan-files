Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, July 26th (TASS): The people of Tehran are still outraged by the Iranian government's use of tanks and tear gas on July 15th to disperse demonstrating crowds. Wives, mothers, and relatives of the demonstrators who were killed, injured, arrested, and missing during the demonstration are holding daily demonstrations in the city.

On July 24th, about four hundred women with children gathered in Baharestan Square, opposite the Parliament Building. They stood there for three hours, holding banners that read: "In the name of our victims, we demand a guarantee of the lives of the Iranian people," "You murdered our sons—at least tell us where their graves are." The demonstrators were surrounded by police. Troops were brought into the city. Twenty tanks patrolled in front of the women and on the streets of the city.

The newspaper *Tolu* pointed out that the purpose of the "tank parade" in Baharestan Square was to provoke another bloody incident and find an excuse to declare martial law.

Xinhua News Agency: Tehran, July 24th (TASS): The newspaper *Kiyam-e Haqiqat* reported that in recent days, British military authorities have flown more than 1,000 paratroopers to Shaiba Airport in Basra, Iraq.

　　伊朗人民继续示威
　  抗议政府血腥镇压
　  英军事当局竟增兵伊朗边境
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰二十六日电：德黑兰人民对于伊朗政府在七月十五日以坦克与催泪瓦斯驱散示威游行群众事件，现在还很激愤。在那次示威中死亡、受伤、被捕与失踪的游行者的妻子、母亲与近亲们，每天都在城中举行示威。
    七月二十四日，约有四百个妇女带着孩子集合在议会大厦对面的巴哈里斯坦广场。他们站在那儿三个钟头，手里拿着横旗，上面写着：“我们以我们的牺牲者的名义，要求保证伊朗人民的生命”、“你们谋杀了我们的儿子——至少要把他们的坟墓告诉我们”。示威的人被警察包围。城内调来了军队。二十辆坦克在妇女面前和城内街道巡逻。
    《托鲁报》指出：在巴哈里斯坦广场举行“坦克游行”的目的，是要挑起另一次流血事件，找寻宣布戒严的借口。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社德黑兰二十四日电：《基亚姆·荷克》报报道，近几天来，英国军事当局开了一千多名伞兵到伊拉克巴士拉的沙伊巴机场。
