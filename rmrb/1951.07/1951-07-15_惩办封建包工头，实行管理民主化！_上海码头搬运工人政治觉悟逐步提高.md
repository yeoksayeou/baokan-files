　　Punish Feudal Foremen, Implement Democratic Management!
    Shanghai Dockworker's Political Consciousness Gradually Improves
    After the abolition of the historically entrenched feudal control system in Shanghai's dockworker industry, the working class's consciousness has been unprecedentedly elevated, and work has seen considerable improvements. The vast dockworker masses have united closely, actively assisting the government in exposing and controlling counter-revolutionaries, and assisting the tax bureau in exposing smuggling and tax evasion. For example, the Wu Shushan group of the Bai Xi Dock in the East Suzhou River District reported three instances of tax evasion in half a month. The tax bureau offered them a bonus, but they refused to accept it, and ultimately donated the bonus to purchase airplanes and cannons. The dockworkers, after liberation, wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, demonstrating a high degree of patriotic fervor. After the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea called for donations for airplanes and cannons, the vast dockworker masses spontaneously rose up to donate. Currently, dockworkers throughout the city have universally incorporated the donation of airplanes and cannons into their patriotic covenants, aiming to donate at least three airplanes within half a year.

  Past Foremen Controlled Docks, Cruelly Beat and Exploited Workers
    The feudal foremen in Shanghai's dockworker industry have consistently colluded with imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionary ruling authorities, acting as traitors, spies, and despots, organizing various feudal gangs, reactionary party groups, and spy organizations. The feudal foremen controlled the docks, forming feudal "kingdoms." Shanghai's 266 large and medium docks, with 28,492 dockworkers, were completely occupied and ruled by feudal foremen. They frequently beat and verbally abused workers, and established private courts. The foreman Xia Jinshan alone was responsible for the death or injury of hundreds of workers. The feudal foremen cruelly exploited 80 percent, or even all, of the workers' total labor income, forcing workers to rely on soliciting tips for alcohol money or stealing goods for a living; this resulted in losses suffered by merchants and travelers, generally estimated to exceed twice the loading and unloading fees. The feudal foremen not only endlessly extorted merchants but also imposed a multitude of handling fees and complex procedures (such as the Taikoo Dock having 33 types of fees, and import and export goods having to go through seven procedures and be handled by six different types of workers), and the labor costs varied greatly between docks, causing merchants and travelers to avoid dock transportation and instead opt for land routes. This feudal control system persisted after liberation, seriously affecting the development of the nation's transportation industry and social order. Feudal foremen used feudal gang organizations to control labor unions, allowing counter-revolutionaries to lurk in the docks, spread rumors, and sow discord, leading to frequent incidents of assault and injury. From June 1949 to November 1950, they instigated over 4,000 disputes, large and small, throughout the city, surrounding the transportation company and the transportation union eight times, even coercing and insulting cadres, and destroying the transportation union's doors, windows, and equipment. These counter-revolutionary activities had reached a rampant level. Without mobilizing the dockworkers to abolish the feudal foreman system and destroy the hiding places of counter-revolutionaries, it would be impossible to effectively implement the people's democratic dictatorship.

  Abolishing the Feudal Control System, Workers Educated Themselves
    Starting in late April this year, under the unified leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and with the cooperation of the worker masses, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, after thorough investigation, arrested 486 head foremen and counter-revolutionaries. Thirty-six of them have already been tried and executed by firing squad. The vast dockworker masses were in high spirits and wholeheartedly supported the People's Government's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries. After the arrest of the feudal foremen, seven short-term study classes for workers were held. 1,734 workers participated in the study. In the study classes, they exposed the crimes of the feudal foremen, further educating themselves. Successively, four regions separately held accusation meetings, with 15,733 workers participating. After the meetings, the workers universally took action, and their class consciousness greatly improved. For example, Chen Gaoshan, an old worker in the Suzhou River District who had never meddled in affairs, said: "The foremen were the pawns of the reactionaries. In the past, no one avenged us, but this time we have been liberated!" Dockworker Ren Zhengming did not get the opportunity to speak at the accusation meeting and, upon returning to his neighborhood, cried as he accused the feudal despots of their crimes to the residents. This sparked a high tide of anti-feudal struggle among dockworkers throughout the city. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries and abolish feudal foremen, two committees for purging counter-revolutionaries and 26 review committees were established in all docks throughout the city. The workers exposed 820 evil landlords and counter-revolutionaries. In addition to the 486 feudal despots arrested, 341 were placed under surveillance, and 614 repented and reformed. The feudal control system has been basically abolished in all docks in Shanghai.

        Workers Consciously Abolished Bad Customs, Established Patriotic Covenants, and Improved Work
    After the abolition of the feudal control system, the vast workers consciously rose up to abolish the bad custom of soliciting "alcohol money," eradicated theft, and simplified handling procedures. For example, the Taikoo Dock has eliminated procedures such as loading onto vehicles and crossing the road, and changed to paying labor costs at once; this ensures the safety and speed of cargo transportation for cargo owners. At the same time, due to the abolition of the feudal division and the implementation of unified allocation, a foundation was laid for future unified adjustment of cargo transportation. In the struggle against feudal foremen, dockworkers established a new attitude of the working class as masters of their own affairs. For example, workers at the Huashun Dock took the lead in abolishing hand hooks, which had been used for many years, and challenged workers throughout the city; workers from docks in various districts responded enthusiastically. Of the 15,563 workers who previously used hand hooks, 14,963 no longer use them, accounting for 96 percent of dockworkers who used hand hooks. This has reduced enormous losses for the state and merchants. In order to protect cargo, workers at the Pu Xi Gonghexiang Dock adopted the method of "cool storage" for stacking goods, ensuring that rice and grain would not generate heat for a long time; they also put forward the slogan of "fast, secure, and tidy." Currently, workers at various docks have universally signed patriotic covenants and are studying ways to improve labor organization. On the basis of abolishing the feudal control system in the docks, it is necessary to consolidate this victory in the future. The transportation company must do a good job in business operations, implement unified team formation, unified allocation, and unified adjustment of labor costs, and establish and improve offices, establish democratic management committees, and implement democratic management of the transportation company. The transportation union must, on the current basis, establish and improve grassroots organizations, review members, purify the union organization, train cadres, and further enhance and consolidate the patriotic enthusiasm of the worker masses, and establish a new labor attitude.

　　惩办封建包工头，实行管理民主化！
    上海码头搬运工人政治觉悟逐步提高
    上海市码头搬运业中的历史悠久的封建把持制度废除之后，搬运工人阶级觉悟空前提高，工作已有不少改进。广大码头工人紧紧地团结起来，积极协助政府检举与管制反革命分子，协助税务局检举走私、漏税。如苏州河东区白西码头吴树山小组，在半月中就检举了三次漏税。税务局发给他们奖金，他们拒而不受，最后把奖金捐献出来买飞机大炮。翻身后的码头工人，衷心热忱地拥护毛主席、共产党，拥护人民政府，表现出高度爱国热情。在抗美援朝总会号召捐献飞机大炮后，广大搬运工人，自动起来进行捐献。现全市码头工人已普遍地把捐献飞机大炮订在爱国公约中，要在半年内至少捐献三架飞机。
  过去包工头割据码头残酷地打骂剥削工人
    上海码头搬运事业中的封建包工头一向与帝国主义，国民党反动统治当局勾结，充当汉奸、特务、恶霸，组织了种类繁多的封建帮派、反动党团、特务组织。封建包工头割据码头，形成封建“王国”。上海二百六十六个大、中码头，二万八千四百九十二个码头工人，完全为封建包工头所霸占、统治。他们经常打骂工人，私设公堂，仅包工头夏金山打死打伤的工人就有数百名之多。封建包工头残酷地剥削工人全部劳动收入的百分之八十甚至全部，逼使工人不得不赖索取酒钱，或偷窃货物以为生；这使商旅所遭受的损失，一般估计要超过装卸费的一倍以上。封建包工头不但对客商进行无尽止地敲诈勒索，而且搬运费目繁多、手续复杂（如太古码头有三十三种费目，进出口货物必须经过七道手续、换六种工人做）、各码头之间力资极不统一，因而形成商旅不敢经码头运输而走旱路。这种封建把持制度在解放后依然存在，严重地影响到国家的运输事业的发展，也严重地影响了社会治安。封建包工头利用封建帮派组织，控制工会，让反革命分子潜伏在码头中，制造谣言，挑拨离间，因此，经常发生殴打伤人事件。一九四九年六月至一九五○年十一月，在全市挑起大、小纠纷四千余件，包围搬运公司，搬运工会八次之多，甚而威逼辱骂干部，捣毁搬运工会门窗器具。这种反革命的活动，已达到猖狂的程度。如不发动搬运工人起来，废除封建把头制度，捣毁反革命分子的掩蔽所，就不能很好地实现人民民主专政。
  废除了封建把持制度工人自己教育了自己
    自今年四月下旬开始，在中国共产党上海市委统一领导和工人群众的配合下，上海市公安局经过周密的调查，逮捕了首恶包工头、反革命分子四百八十六名。其中三十六名已经过审判执行枪决。广大码头工人情绪十分高涨，衷心地拥护人民政府大张旗鼓镇压反革命。在逮捕封建包工头之后，举办了七次工人短期学习班。参加学习的工人有一千七百三十四人。他们在学习班中揭发了封建包工头的罪行，更进一步教育了自己；先后在四个地区分别地举行了控诉大会，参加控诉大会的工人一万五千七百三十三人，会后工人普遍地行动起来，阶级觉悟大为提高。如苏州河区从来不管闲事的老工人陈高山说：“包工头子是反动派的爪牙，过去没有人给我们出气，这回我们可翻了身！”码头工人任正明没有得到上台控诉的机会，回到自己住的里弄，哭着向居民控诉封建恶霸罪行。这样在全市码头工人中就掀起来反封建斗争的高潮。在镇压反革命与废除封建把头的运动中，全市各码头建立起来两个肃清反革命委员会，二十六个审查委员会，工人检举恶霸地主及反革命分子八百二十人。除已逮捕的四百八十六名封建恶霸分子外，管制了三百四十一人，悔过自新的六百十四人。上海市全部码头已基本上废除了封建把持制度。
        工人自觉地废除了陋规订立爱国公约改进工作
    在废除封建把持制度后，广大工人自觉地起来废除了索取“酒钱”的陋规，根绝了偷窃行为，并且简化了搬运手续。如：太古码头已取消了上车，过马路等手续，并且改为一次付力资；这样就保证了货主运货的安全迅速。同时，由于废除了封建割据的局面，实行了统一调配，就给今后统一调整运货打下了基础。搬运工人在反封建把头的斗争中，树立起了工人阶级做主人翁的新的劳动态度。如：华顺码头工人首先废除多年使用惯了的手钩，并以此向全市工人挑战；各区码头工人纷纷应战，在过去使用手钩的一万五千五百六十三个工人中，已有一万四千九百六十三人不再使用，占使用手钩码头工人的百分之九十六。这样就给国家和客商减少了巨大的损失。为了爱护客货，浦西公和祥码头工人堆装，都采取“风凉装”的方法，使米粮持久不发热；并提出“要快、要牢、要整齐”的口号。现在各码头工人已普遍订出爱国公约，正在研究改善劳动组织。在废除码头上封建把持制度的基础上，今后必须巩固住这一胜利果实。搬运公司要搞好业务工作，贯彻统一编队，统一调配，统一调整力资，并建立与健全办事处，建立民主管理委员会，实行搬运公司管理民主化。搬运工会要在现在的基础上，建立与健全基层组织，审查会员，纯洁工会组织，培养干部，并进一步提高与巩固工人群众的爱国热情，树立新的劳动态度。
