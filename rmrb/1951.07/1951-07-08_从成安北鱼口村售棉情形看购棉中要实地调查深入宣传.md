　　From the Cotton Sales in Beiyukou Village, Cheng'an, Seeing the Need for On-the-Ground Investigation and Thorough Promotion in Cotton Purchasing
    Beiyukou Village in Cheng'an, Hebei, is a village of 177 households. Last year, the whole village planted 243 mu of cotton, producing approximately 290,000 jin. Before June this year, most of it had been sold. But some remained.
    When the cotton purchasing and storage work was first assigned to the village, the village cadres did not actively mobilize the masses, but passively and subjectively estimated the cotton storage situation of the masses: how much cotton was planted last year, how much was produced, how much was sold, how much was for the autumn tax, how much was for self-use... After calculating, the village's cotton storage was estimated to be no more than 2,000 jin. Therefore, their conclusion was: "There are no fish in the river, it is useless to cast a hook." The work was not energetic, and they lost confidence in completing the task.
    After learning of this situation, the cadres sent by the higher authorities to work in the village believed that the village cadres' estimate was subjective and might not be in line with the actual situation. Therefore, they helped the village cadres conduct in-depth investigation and research, and at the same time carried out patriotic ideological education among the masses, and enlightened the cotton farmers' political consciousness. As a result, it was quickly discovered that the actual amount of cotton stored in the village was much larger than the village cadres estimated. Only an investigation of seven middle-peasant households revealed that they had 3,000 jin of cotton in storage. The area investigated by the secretary of the CCP village branch also had more than 3,000 jin of cotton in storage. After patriotic education and further dispelling cotton farmers' ideological concerns about selling and storing cotton (such as fear of exposing wealth, fear of not being able to buy the items they need, etc.), the masses were mobilized to formulate a patriotic cotton selling pledge, and a mass movement to accuse the crimes of Japanese and American imperialism was launched. Comparing their experiences in the old society with their current lives, the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses generally increased. They expressed their willingness to sell their stored cotton to the state. The farmer Yang Manlu initially only reported 100 jin; after speaking out about his suffering and raising his awareness, he sold all the other 800 jin. His wife even cleared out the remaining 20 jin in the house and reported it. The old middle peasant Geng Tingdong also reported all 352 jin of his stored cotton. The farmer Geng Benshan said when selling cotton: "If it weren't for the People's Government leading us to grow more cotton and helping us increase production in various ways, how could we have this cotton?" Under the leadership of party members and members of the Youth League in the village, in just one day, the whole village sold more than 11,000 jin of unginned cotton, exceeding the village cadres' estimated amount by five or six times.

### 从成安北鱼口村售棉情形看购棉中要实地调查深入宣传

　　从成安北鱼口村售棉情形看
    购棉中要实地调查深入宣传
    河北成安北鱼口是一个一百七十七户人家的村庄。去年全村种了二百四十三亩棉花，约产二十九万斤。今年六月以前，大部都卖了。但也还存着一部分。
    购棉储棉工作最初布置到村时，村干部不积极去发动群众，而是消极地、主观地估计群众存棉情况：去年植棉多少，产棉多少，出售了多少，秋征多少，自用多少……算来算去，村里存棉最多也不过二千斤。因此他们的结论是：“河里无鱼白下钩。”工作很不起劲，丧失了完成任务的信心。
    上级派赴该村工作的干部获悉此种情况后，认为村干部的估计是主观的，不一定合乎实际。于是帮助村干部进行深入的调查研究，并同时对群众进行爱国主义思想教育，启发棉农的政治自觉。这样做的结果，很快就发现村中实际存棉量比村干部估计的大得多。仅七户中农调查，就有存棉三千斤。中共村支部书记调查的一片，也有存棉三千多斤。经过爱国教育与进一步解除棉农售棉储棉的思想顾虑（如怕露富、怕买不到所需要的实物等），发动群众制定了卖棉爱国公约，又开展了群众性的控诉日本和美国帝国主义罪行的运动，以自己在旧社会的遭遇和现在的生活对比，群众的爱国热情普遍高涨起来，纷纷表示愿意出售存棉给国家。农民杨满路开始只报一百斤；经过诉苦，觉悟提高，把另外八百斤全部卖了出来。家里零碎剩下二十斤，他媳妇又清出来自报了。老中农耿廷栋也将三百五十二斤存棉全报了。农民耿本善在卖棉时说：“要不是人民政府领导咱们多种棉，又用各种办法帮助咱们增产，咱怎能有这些棉？”在村中党员、团员带动之下仅仅一天，全村就卖出籽棉一万一千余斤，超过村干部估计数量的五、六倍。
