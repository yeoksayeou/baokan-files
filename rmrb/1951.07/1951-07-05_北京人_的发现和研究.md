The Discovery and Research of "Peking Man"
    Pei Wenzhong

Many people believe that China's scientific research is backward and cannot compare with the "advanced" capitalist countries. This idea is incorrect, wrong, and a result of the deceptive education of the long-term reactionary ruling class and foreign imperialist invaders.

In the past forty or fifty years, our Chinese scientific community has suffered from the double and brutal oppression of imperialists and bureaucratic comprador classes. Under such circumstances, according to common sense, our science should not have made much progress or achievements. However, due to the superior character of our Chinese nation and its unyielding fighting will, great achievements of world significance have been made in many scientific fields.

Due to my personal limitations in knowledge, I will only talk about the small issue of the discovery and research of "Peking Man." "Peking Man" is the common name for "Sinanthropus pekinensis," discovered in Zhoukoudian, Fangshan County, Hebei Province. He is a primitive human who lived in China 400,000 to 500,000 years ago, representing the first "ape-man stage" in the history of human development, which is the first process of "from ape to man."

We all know that humans evolved slowly from ancient apes as a result of bipedal labor. But where is the evidence? "Peking Man" is the best and most complete evidence.

From Zhoukoudian, after more than ten years of hard work, we have discovered many materials of "Peking Man," including five relatively complete skulls, more than a dozen relatively complete mandibles, more than one hundred individual teeth, and seven or eight broken body bones. According to our research, the skull of Peking Man has a prominent brow ridge like a crest (the brow ridge of modern humans is almost flat), a low and flat frontal bone, and a low and backward-sloping parietal bone. The front part of his mandible protrudes forward (the front part of modern humans is almost vertical). All of these characteristics are very similar to apes. On the other hand, many subtle characteristics of his skull, the shape and structure of his teeth, and the shape of his body bones are all characteristics of "humans." Therefore, we believe that "Peking Man" is a human with ape-like characteristics, which is the first step in the development of ancient apes towards humans.

This kind of human with ape-like characteristics no longer exists in the modern world. Only his skeletal remains are buried in the soil and stone. After hundreds of thousands of years, they have become heavy, hard stones, or fossils. The "Peking Man" discovered in Zhoukoudian is this kind of fossil.

Four kinds of ape-man fossils have been discovered in the world, among which "Peking Man" has the richest and most abundant materials, and is found together with "Peking Man's" production tools, indicating the initial stage of human beings working with both hands. Therefore, among the four kinds of ape-men, only "Peking Man" can not only prove Darwin's theory that humans evolved from apes, but also prove Engels' theory that "labor created man."

We Chinese people often boast that China has thousands of years of glorious and rich history; but we often neglect and ignore that before history, as far back as 400,000 to 500,000 years ago, there were already humans and culture on our beloved land, which played a major role and made great contributions in the long and arduous history of all mankind's conquest of nature. Unfortunately, in the past semi-feudal and semi-colonial situation, under the command of imperialist employed "scholars" and Chinese comprador classes, all publications were in English, and the publications were mainly sent to foreign countries, so that the general public in our country did not know about this major scientific event.

The discovery and preliminary research on "Peking Man" has a tragic history of more than ten years, which is the most typical and representative example of scientific work in the past semi-colonial society.

This preliminary work was carried out entirely during the era of the reactionary bureaucratic comprador class government, nominally a "joint venture" between China and the US imperialist "Rockefeller Foundation," but in reality, it was the foreign imperialist employed "scholars" enslaving Chinese scientific workers. At that time, the person in charge on the Chinese side was even more of a typical representative of the bureaucratic comprador class, using the blood and sweat of practical workers to exchange for their fame and fortune and to buy the favor of foreign masters.

In 1910, a Swede named Andersson discovered many fossils of ancient animal skeletons in a cave in Zhoukoudian. He was then the mining advisor to the Beiyang warlord government, but he was not interested in China's mining industry. He only used his authority to conduct prehistoric archaeology and excavate animal bone fossils in various parts of China. Later, he hired an Austrian to China to help him excavate animal bone fossils. This Austrian went to Zhoukoudian, excavated many animal bone fossils, and took them to Sweden for research.

In 1926, this Austrian discovered two teeth resembling human teeth in the fossils collected from Zhoukoudian in Sweden. When the news reached Beijing, the China Geological Survey signed a contract with the Rockefeller Foundation to jointly "cooperate" in excavating animal fossils in Zhoukoudian. In 1927, a Swede was hired to be responsible for the excavation work in Zhoukoudian. The result of this year's work was the discovery of another tooth resembling a human tooth. The representative of the American Rockefeller Foundation's interests—a Briton—named the human fossil from Zhoukoudian "Sinanthropus pekinensis," commonly known as "Peking Man," representing primitive humans resembling apes.

This Briton's theory, because it was based on too little material, failed to gain the trust and attention of the world's academic community. Therefore, he asked the Rockefeller Foundation to "invest" again, and the work continued in 1928. Due to the expansion of the work, Chinese and French people participated. This excavation of "Peking Man" fully reflected the situation in China at that time. Except for the representatives of Japanese imperialism, the representatives of any imperialist power stretched out their evil hands to "get involved" and plunder academic honors.

By 1929, these "scholars" from many countries and the representatives of US imperialism all believed that the excavation of "Peking Man" had become a "chicken rib," so they were willing to let go of this arduous and hopeless work, which they considered "tasteless to eat and a pity to discard," and handed it over to the Chinese to be responsible for. At this time, the hardest rock layer was being excavated. Fossils of any animal were very rare. They had repeatedly proposed to stop work, but due to the persistence of the Chinese in charge and the efforts of the workers, we soon excavated this hardest rock layer. Unexpectedly, a layer of soil containing abundant fossils was exposed below. Even more unexpectedly, in December of that year, the first complete skull fossil of "Peking Man" was discovered. Before this, we only had a few teeth and broken mandibles to represent "Peking Man." In the research, we felt the lack of materials and could not serve as a strong example of human evolution. But with this complete skull, the problem was solved and all doubts were swept away! Therefore, this discovery was praised and approved by the academic community all over the world.

Because of this discovery, the US imperialist Rockefeller Foundation continued to invest in order to obtain more "Peking Man" materials for the US imperialist representatives to study and strive for personal academic status. The most important clause in the contract initially signed between the ruling class of the Chinese bureaucratic comprador class and US imperialism was: the materials of "Peking Man" should be studied by the representatives of the US imperialist Rockefeller Foundation, and the Chinese should only be responsible for excavating for them, without the right to study. This is the so-called "friendship" and "goodwill assistance" of US imperialism to the Chinese people.

However, the comrades who actually worked on the Chinese side were unwilling to lag behind. Beyond the provisions of the contract, they worked hard in the fields of archaeology, paleontology, and geological geomorphology, and also achieved brilliant results, without shrinking due to imperialist suppression.

Under the dual oppression of imperialist "scholars" and the ruling class of the bureaucratic comprador class, the Chinese scientists participating in this work continued to struggle and work hard. In addition to the fossils of "Peking Man," the research on the age, culture, and environment of "Peking Man" was completed satisfactorily by Chinese working comrades, so that our knowledge about "Peking Man" was complete and flawless.

Unfortunately, when Japanese imperialism occupied North China, the enemy not only persecuted our comrades participating in this work, but also killed our three loyal workers who guarded Zhoukoudian. Furthermore, they tried to plunder the "Peking Man" fossils, which had high academic value. According to our speculation from various signs, after our victory in the Anti-Japanese War, US imperialism plundered the Peking Man fossils from the Japanese (I have published another article detailing the process, which is omitted here).

All of China has been liberated, the Chinese people have won, the feudal forces of the bureaucratic comprador class have been swept away, the aggressive remnants of foreign imperialism have been expelled, the people have taken control of political power, and all construction undertakings have achieved steady and rapid progress in the short period of more than a year.

The research on "Peking Man," like other undertakings, has also been developed in the year after liberation, and the research work has taken a step forward.

We know that the preliminary research on "Peking Man" is a suspended work, high above the ground, just a set of knowledge for scholars who are obsessed with minutiae and has no relationship with the people. In other words, this preliminary research is too specialized and too profound, and has no connection with the actual lives of our general people.

In fact, the high academic value of the discovery of "Peking Man" and his tools lies in proving the theory of the great revolutionary teacher Engels that "labor created man" and the theory of historical materialism on human development. With the joint discovery of "Peking Man" and the stone tools he made and used, the Marxist-Leninist theory on human development has been fully scientifically proven. Only in the new China after liberation, in the new China led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, can this lofty value be properly recognized and duly respected.

Since the beginning of 1950, the Beijing History Museum, under the direct leadership and assistance of the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture, has gathered relevant scientific workers and artistic workers from all over Beijing, brought into play the collective strength of the Chinese people, and conducted further research on "Peking Man." How "Peking Man" lived in natural caves, how to make and use simple and crude stone tools, how to fight to the death with man-eating beasts, how to conquer the nature of the time with both hands and wisdom, etc., are all expressed in models, objects and pictures, and become an important part of the primitive society exhibition hall of the history of social development in China, so that the general public can also understand how our distant ancestors of 400,000 to 500,000 years ago played a huge role and made great contributions in creating the world of modern humans. In addition to loving our great motherland of the present and the glorious and brilliant history of the past, we also know what role our ancient ancestors played in the development process of all mankind, fully develop the revolutionary theory, and educate the broad masses of the people.

In this way, the specialized scientific work that was previously divorced from reality and the people has been developed normally, and the supreme task of science serving the people has been completed. This research, although a small part of a small department of science, we believe that it has a certain role in educating the general public. We should, and are proud that, in the new China led by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, all undertakings have been properly developed! We have made great achievements!

　　“北京人”的发现和研究
    裴文中
    许多人以为中国人的科学研究落后，比不上资本主义的“先进”国家。这种思想是不正确的，是错误的，是受了长期的反动统治阶级和外国帝国主义侵略者欺骗教育的结果。
    在过去四五十年中，我们中国科学界，曾受过帝国主义者和官僚买办阶级的双重的惨酷压迫，按照常情来说，在这种情形之下，我们的科学不会有什么大的进步和成绩；然而由于我们中华民族的优越的性格，有坚苦不拔的斗争意志，在科学的许多部门中，都有伟大的，具有世界意义的成绩。
    因为我个人受了学识的限制，现在我只谈“北京人”的发现和研究的一个小问题。“北京人”就是“中国猿人”的俗称，发现在河北省房山县周口店。他是四五十万年前，生存在中国的原始人类，代表人类发展史的第一个“猿人阶段”，也就是代表“从猿到人”的第一个过程。
    我们都知道：人类是由古代的猿类，因为两手劳动的结果，慢慢演变进化而来。但是证据在那里？“北京人”就是最好、最完备的证据。
    从周口店这个地方，经过我们十几年的辛苦工作，发现了很多的“北京人”的材料，包括五个比较完整的头骨，十几个比较完整的下牙床，单个的牙齿一百多个，身上的体骨破碎者七八块。据我们的研究，北京人的头骨，眉上骨突出象稜脊一样（我们现在人的眉上骨差不多是平的），额骨低平，头顶骨低而偏后，下牙床的前部向前突出（我们现代人的前部差不多是垂直的）。以上这许多种性质，都是与猿很相象的。另一方面，他的头骨的许多微细的性质，牙齿的形状和构造，体骨的形状等，却又都是“人”的性质。因此，我们认为：“北京人”是具有猿类性质的人类，也就是古猿向人的方面发展的第一步。
    这种具有猿类性质的人类，在现代的世界上，已经没有了，只有他遗留下的骨骸，埋藏在土石之中，经过了几十万年，已经变成沉重的坚硬的石头，或者叫作化石。在周口店发现的“北京人”，就是这种化石。
    在世界上，已经发现了四种猿人的化石，其中以“北京人”的材料最丰富最多，而且与“北京人”的生产工具共同发现在一起，说明了人类开始用两只手工作的最初的阶段。因此，四种猿人之中，只有“北京人”不但能够证明达尔文的人类从猿进化而来的学说，更证明了恩格斯的“劳动创造了人”的理论。
    我们中国人常常夸耀中国有几千年的光荣而丰富的历史；但是常常忽略漠视：在有历史以前，远在四五十万年之前，在我们这块可爱的国土上，已经有了人类，有了文化，在整个人类征服自然的漫长而坚苦的历史上，曾发生过重大的作用，有伟大的供献。可惜在过去半封建半殖民地的情况下，在帝国主义御用“学者”和中国买办阶级指挥之下，一切刊物都用英文，而且刊物主要是寄往外国，因此使我国一般的人民大众都不晓得这个科学上的重大事迹。
    关于“北京人”的发现和初步研究，曾有十几年的惨痛历史，是最典型的，最有代表性的，在过去半殖民地社会中的一个科学工作的实例。
    这一个初步工作，是完全在反动官僚买办阶级政府时代进行的，名义上是中国与美帝国主义的“罗氏基金委员会”“合办”，实际上是外国帝国主义的御用“学者”奴役中国科学工作者。那时中国方面的主持者，更是最典型的官僚买办阶级的代表人物，以实际工作者的血汗，来换取他们的功名利禄及买得外国主子的欢心。
    一九一○年，有一位瑞典人安特生，在周口店的一个山洞里，发现了许多古代动物骨骼的化石。他当时是北洋军阀政府的矿业顾问，但是他对于中国的矿业没有兴趣，只是利用他的职权，在中国各地进行史前考古及掘挖动物骨骼化石的工作。他后来又聘请了一位奥国人来华，帮助他进行掘挖动物骨骼化石工作。这位奥国人曾到周口店去，掘挖了许多动物骨骼化石，带到瑞典去研究。
    到了一九二六年，这位奥国人在瑞典，由周口店采集的化石中，发见了两个象人类的牙齿。这个消息传到北京，中国地质调查所，遂与罗氏基金委员会订立了合同，共同“合作”，进行在周口店挖掘动物化石的工作。一九二七年，请了一位瑞典人负责进行在周口店挖掘的工作。这一年的工作，结果又发现了一枚象人的牙齿。代表美国罗氏基金会的利益者——一位英国人——根据这一枚牙齿，订名周口店的人类化石为“中国猿人”，俗名“北京人”，他代表象人象猿的原始人类。
    这位英国人的理论，因为根据的材料太少，未能取得世界上学术界的信任和重视，于是他又要求罗氏基金委员会再行“投资”，一九二八年仍然继续工作下去，因为工作的扩大，有了中国人和法国人参加。这个发掘“北京人”的工作，完全反映了当时我们中国的情况，除了日本帝国主义的代表者以外，任何帝国主义者的代表人物，都伸出魔手来“染指”，来抢掠学术上的荣誉。
    到了一九二九年，这许多国家的“学者”们及美帝国主义的代表们，都认为发掘“北京人”的工作，成了“鸡肋”，于是将这个“食之无味，弃之可惜”的坚苦而认为没有希望的工作，才肯放松了手，交给了中国人来负责。这个时候，正发掘到了一层最坚硬的石层，任何动物的化石都很稀少，他们曾屡次提议停止工作，但由于负责的中国人的坚持，再加工人们的努力，我们不久就掘完了这一层最坚硬的石层；出乎他们意料之外，下边露出一层含有丰富的化石的土层；更是他们所梦想不到的，在那年十二月中，发现了第一个完整的“北京人”的头骨化石。在此以前，我们只有几个牙齿和破碎的下牙床代表“北京人”，在研究上感到材料的贫乏，不能作人类进化的有力的例证。但是有了这一个完整的头骨，问题就解决了，一切的怀疑都扫除干净了！因此，这个发现，得到了全世界上学术界的推崇和赞许。
    因为有了这个发现，美帝国主义的罗氏基金委员会又继续投资，以便多得些“北京人”的材料由美帝国主义的代表人来研究，争取个人学术上的地位。当初代表中国的官僚买办阶级的统治者与美帝国主义订立的合同中，最主要的一条是：“北京人”的材料要由美帝国主义的罗氏基金会的代表人来研究，中国人只有负替他们挖掘的责任，没有研究的权利。这就是美帝国主义所谓对中国人民的“友谊”和“善意的帮助”。
    但是中国方面实际工作的同志，却不肯落后，在合同规定之外，在考古学、古生物学及地质地文学方面，努力钻研，也同样获得了辉煌的成绩，没有因为帝国主义的扼制而萎缩下去。
    在帝国主义的“学者”及官僚买办阶级统治者双重压迫之下，中国参加这个工作的科学家，继续不断地在苦难中斗争着，努力着，除了“北京人”的化石以外，其余有关“北京人”的年代，文化和环境等研究，都由中国工作同志们圆满的完成，使我们对于“北京人”有关的知识完备无缺。
    不幸在日本帝国主义侵占华北的时候，敌人不但迫害我们参加这个工作的同志们，且杀戮了我们的忠实的看守周口店的三位工人，更进一步设法来掠夺这个在学术上有崇高价值的“北京人”化石。据我们由种种迹象来推测，我国抗战胜利后，美帝国主义又从日本人手中，将北京人的化石掠夺去了（我已另有专文发表，其经过详情从略）。
    全中国解放了，中国人民胜利了，扫除了官僚买办阶级的封建势力，驱逐了外国帝国主义的侵略残余，人民掌握了政权，一切建设事业，都在短短的一年多的期间，得到了稳固而迅速的进展。
    关于“北京人”的研究，也同其他事业一样，在解放后一年之中，得到了发展，研究工作更向前迈进了一步。
    我们知道：“北京人”的初步研究是一种悬空的工作，高高在上，只是钻了牛犄角尖的学者们的一套与人民不发生关系的学问。换句话说，就是这个初步的研究，太专门了，太高深了，与我们一般人民的实际生活没有联系。
    其实“北京人”和他使用工具的发现，在学术上崇高的价值是在于证明了伟大的革命导师恩格斯“劳动创造了人”的理论和历史唯物主义的人类发展的学说。有了“北京人”和他制造及使用的石器共同发现，马克思列宁主义关于人类发展的学说，就完全得到了科学上的证明。只有在解放后的新中国，在毛主席和中国共产党领导的新中国，这个崇高的价值才能得到正当的认识和应当得的尊崇。
    从一九五○年年初起，北京历史博物馆，在中央文化部文物局直接领导和帮助之下，集合了全北京市有关的科学工作者及艺术工作者，发挥了中国人的集体的力量，对于“北京人”作了进一步的研究。“北京人”如何居住在天然的山洞中，如何打制和使用简单粗劣的石器，如何与吃人的猛兽作生死的斗争，如何用两只手和智慧征服了当时的自然界等等，都用模型、实物和图画表现出来，成为中国社会发展史的原始社会陈列室的重要部分，使一般群众也可以了解，我们四五十万年前的远祖，在创造现代人类的世界中，曾经发挥过如何巨大的力量和有过如何伟大的供献。使我们除了热爱现在的伟大的祖国和过去光荣的灿烂的历史之外，更使我们知道，我们的远古祖先在全人类的发展过程上所起的作用，充分的发挥了革命的理论，教育了广大的人民群众。
    这样，就使从前脱离实际与人民脱节的专门科学工作，得到了正常的发展，完成了科学为人民服务的至高任务。这个研究，虽是科学中一小部门的一点微末工作，但我们相信，在教育一般人民群众上，实有它一定的作用。我们应当，而且值得骄傲：我们在中国共产党和毛主席领导的新中国，一切事业都得到了正当的发展！有了伟大的成就！（附图片）
