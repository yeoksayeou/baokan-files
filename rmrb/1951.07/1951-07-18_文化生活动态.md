Cultural Life Updates

Literary and Art Circles Continue to Carry Out Production Increase and Donation Campaign

　　Literary and art circles in various regions continue to strengthen anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda activities, and more extensively and deeply carry out performances and exhibitions for patriotic production increase and donation of "Lu Xun" airplanes. Among them, the donation campaign in Shanghai's literary and art circles is relatively large-scale. On July 11, Shanghai's literary and art circles held a relatively broad representative meeting for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. More than 380 representatives from various units attended the meeting. The meeting reported on the initial work of various units in responding to the three major appeals of the Anti-American and Aid Korea General Branch, adopted the literary and art circle's half-year donation plan and patriotic convention. According to the current donation situation, which has already formed a heat wave, the donation amount has exceeded the original target of 3 billion yuan. The meeting further proposed donating a small squadron (three planes) of "Lu Xun" fighters as a striving goal. The preparation work for the Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) circles' charity performances is proceeding very intensively. The Yue Opera and Peking Opera circles have both proposed guaranteeing the completion of the task of donating airplanes. Other opera genres are also enthusiastically holding charity performances. Literary, art, music, and film units have all formulated detailed production increase plans. Many plans have proposed a very necessary point: not only should the quantity of increased production be large, but the quality should also be good, because bad literary and artistic creations cannot become fighting propaganda weapons.

Veteran Opera Actors Hao Shouchen and Others to Hold Second Charity Performance

　　Hao Shouchen, Xiao Changhua, Tan Xiaopei and other professors from the Beijing Opera Experimental School and veteran actors from the opera circle will soon hold a second charity performance. Peking Opera amateurs Bao Daning, Zhang Xiaoshan, Zhang Boju, Yu Zhishan, Qian Baosen and others held a joint charity performance. Bao Daning and others are all over sixty years old and have been away from the stage for many years. This collaboration in a charity performance fully demonstrates their patriotic enthusiasm. All actors in the Beijing Quyi circles also enthusiastically launched donations. All students of the Blind Artists Training Class, in addition to pledging donations, are also preparing to hold a charity performance. The Shanghai Flying Car Wall Walking Troupe, which just arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, donated all the income from the first day's performance and prepared to continue the charity performance until the end of the anti-American and aid-Korea movement; and prepared to entertain and comfort the soldiers. The Tianqiao Quyi Improvement Group, the Xingxing Circus, the Feifeifei Technology Troupe, and more than 20 other recreational societies have all successively held charity performances, and individual actors have also formulated personal donation plans.

　　In addition, literary and art circles in Wuhan, Qiqihar, Jinhua and Jiande in Zhejiang Province, and Zhaodong, Bei'an, Jingxing, and Hailun in Heilongjiang Province, have also held charity performances and exhibitions to donate airplanes and cannons. This broad patriotic charity performance and donation movement not only educated the audience in an artistic form, but also educated the literary and art circles themselves in patriotism and improved their political awareness.

Hebei Provincial People's Government Increases the Construction of Hebei Normal College

  文学艺术界继续开展增产捐献运动
    各地文学艺术界继续加强抗美援朝宣传活动，更广泛深入地为爱国增产捐献“鲁迅号”飞机，开展义演、义展运动。其中较有规模的为上海文艺界的捐献运动。七月十一日上海文艺界举行了一个较为广泛的抗美援朝代表会议，出席各单位代表三百八十余人，会议汇报了各单位响应抗美援朝总会三大号召的初步工作情况，通过了文艺界半年捐献计划和爱国公约，根据目前已经形成热潮的捐献情形，捐款数字已超过原定目标三十亿元，会议进一步提出捐献“鲁迅号”战斗机一小队（三架）作为奋斗目标。曲艺界筹备义演的工作进行的很紧张，越剧界京剧界均提出保证完成捐献飞机的任务。其他各剧种，也都极为踊跃的举行义演。文学、美术、音乐和电影等单位，均都订了详密的增产计划，有不少计划中都提出了十分必要的一条：不但要增产的量多，而且要质好，因为坏的文艺创作，是不能成为战斗的宣传武器的。
  戏曲界老演员郝寿臣等即将举行二次义演
    北京戏曲实验学校的教授，戏曲界老演员郝寿臣、萧长华、谭小培等即将举行二次义演。京剧界票友包丹庭、章小山、张伯驹、于芝珊、钱宝森等举行联合义演，包丹庭等均年在六旬以上，多年脱离舞台生活，此次合作义演，充分表现了他们的爱国热忱。北京曲艺界班社全体演员，也热烈展开捐献。盲艺人讲习班全体学员除了认捐外，还预备举行义演。由上海刚来北京的上海飞车走壁团，第一天的演出收入，全部捐献，还准备继续义演，直到抗美援朝运动结束为止；并预备招待和慰问战士。天桥曲艺改进小组、星星马戏团、飞飞飞技术团等二十余游艺社，均相继举行义演，个别演员并订了个人的捐献计划。
    此外，武汉、齐齐哈尔市及浙江省金华、建德，黑龙江省的肇东、北安、景星、海伦等地文艺界，也都举行义演、义展捐献飞机大炮。这样广阔的爱国义演捐献运动，不但用艺术形式教育了观众，而且文艺界本身也在此运动中受到了爱国主义的教育，提高了政治觉悟。
