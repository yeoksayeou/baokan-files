　　Zhangjiakou Transport Company Workers Poisoned While Handling Asphalt Blocks
    Relevant Departments Should Conduct Self-Criticism
    The Workers' Daily reported a series of poisoning incidents involving transport workers in April, May and June, in order to draw the attention of various government agencies, public and private enterprises, and transport companies. However, on June 6th, another incident of workers being poisoned while handling asphalt occurred in Zhangjiakou. The Beijing-Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department entrusted the Chahar Provincial Trust Company of Zhangjiakou to sell asphalt blocks on its behalf. The asphalt blocks they shipped to Zhangjiakou were packaged in straw sacks, which easily leads to poisoning during handling. However, they did not notify the other party in advance. The Chahar Provincial Trust Company was unaware of the properties of asphalt, and the transport company did not notice the toxicity of asphalt when undertaking the work. Therefore, the workers were unprepared when handling it, resulting in the poisoning of thirty-nine people. Workers Xia Yuquan and Zhu Wenhua suffered severe poisoning, resulting in hematemesis. Fortunately, due to timely treatment, all poisoned workers quickly recovered.
    The Workers' Daily has repeatedly exposed incidents of workers being poisoned while handling toxic goods, but why didn't the Beijing-Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department explain the nature of the goods to the other party when shipping them to Zhangjiakou? Furthermore, the Chahar Provincial Trust Company of Zhangjiakou and the Zhangjiakou Transport Company carelessly allowed workers to handle the goods without clarifying whether the items were toxic. This shows that they did not attach importance to the health and safety of the workers. I hope they will learn from this incident and conduct a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

### 张家口搬运公司工人搬运沥青块多人中毒  有关部门应进行检讨

　　张家口搬运公司工人搬运沥青块多人中毒
    有关部门应进行检讨
    工人日报在四、五、六月份曾连续报道了搬运工人中毒事件，以提起各地机关、公私企业部门及搬运公司注意。但在六月六日，张家口竟又发生工人搬运沥青中毒的事情。东北贸易部京津办事处委托张家口察哈尔省信托公司代销沥青块。他们运到张家口的沥青块系用草袋包装，搬运时很容易中毒。但他们却不事先通知对方。察哈尔省信托公司不知道沥青的性质，搬运公司在承揽时，也未注意到沥青有毒。所以，工人在搬运时毫无防备，结果有三十九人中毒。夏玉泉、朱文华两工人因中毒较重，以致吐血。幸因救治及时，全部中毒工人很快即恢复健康。
    工人日报曾一再揭露了工人搬运毒品中毒事件，但东北贸易部京津办事处往张家口发货时，为什么不向对方说明物品的性质呢？而张家口察哈尔省信托公司及张家口搬运公司，不弄清物品是否有毒，就随便让工人搬运。这说明他们对工人的健康和安全均极不重视。我希望他们接受此事件的教训，并在报纸上公开检讨。
