Several Problems in Current Basic Construction

Cui Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Central Heavy Industry Department

After the People's Daily launched criticisms and discussions on certain errors in basic construction, comrades working in our industrial departments, in addition to participating in discussions organized by the administrative side, have also spontaneously organized and are organizing discussions on basic construction issues. Everyone feels that such discussions combined with practical reviews will be of great help to current and future work.

The basic construction we have already carried out and are carrying out is not yet the beginning of the country's large-scale new construction; its focus is still on the restoration and appropriate development of existing enterprises. The task of basic construction in this stage is not only to do a good job in restoring and developing old enterprises, but more importantly, to train personnel, accumulate experience, and strive to learn how to carry out basic construction as soon as possible in order to meet new and greater construction tasks.

Although we have many favorable conditions for carrying out construction, such as the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, especially the workers engaged in enterprise work, abundant resources, and the strong support of socialist countries and various new democratic countries, and precisely because of these favorable conditions, our basic construction has achieved significant results; but we also have many difficult conditions, mainly the lack of experience in carrying out construction, and insufficient human, financial, and material resources. Although these difficulties are temporary, they directly affect current work. Therefore, it is conceivable that certain errors may occur in basic construction. But the key issue is how to seriously analyze and review the errors that have already occurred, thereby gaining experience and improving capabilities, so that we do not commit or commit fewer errors in the future. In our discussions, we have initially recognized several problems in basic construction and are willing to put them forward as a reference for everyone to discuss this issue.

(I)

The deviations and errors that have already occurred in basic construction are manifested in three aspects: namely, planning, design, and construction.

Some basic construction projects have problems in planning. The "planning" referred to here is to decide what to do. For example, to build a factory, mine, or building. The decision on what to do must be based on evidence, first of all, whether it is needed, and secondly, resources, financial resources, human resources, and other economic conditions. If the plan is not thorough or errors occur, the design will have no reliable basis, and the result of the design will be a waste of effort; if construction is carried out, the waste will be even greater. We have examples of changing plans. For example, last year, based on the conditions, it was decided to build a factory to manufacture product A (assumed name). Experts were then concentrated to carry out the design and have been working for a year; now there are doubts about this product. After much discussion, it was unanimously agreed that manufacturing product B (assumed name) would be more in line with the needs of the country, so it was decided to change it, and the previous design was useless, and it had to start again from scratch. Another example is the Dingxiang Iron Mine (published in the People's Daily on July 5th). As far as we know, the resource materials were not accurately grasped. After design, construction, and commencement of work, it was found that the iron ore seam was inclined and extended downwards, making mining difficult, and the iron content was low, so its current value was not great. After two years of work, it has recently been decided to stop work.

Some basic construction projects have problems in design. "Design" is the specific plan to realize the plan. If you want to build an enterprise or part of it, the design has two parts, namely the architectural part and the mechanical equipment part. The main part we have already constructed is the architectural part, where the most problems occur. The examples revealed by the People's Daily are mainly in this area and do not need to be listed again. In short, it is hasty design and blind construction, resulting in rework and waste.

Some basic construction projects have problems in construction. With a "correct design," there must also be "correct construction." "Design" is still on paper, while "construction" is action. Wrong actions directly cause material losses. For example, in a factory in Tianjin, a factory building and a pool were built last year, and the two were very close (less than two feet apart). After completion, the bottom of the pool cracked and could not store water. It was found that the contractor used poor materials (cement) and did not take into account the different pressures of the two. Other problems in construction include the lack of close coordination of various work steps, which delays the time, wastes manpower and materials, and makes the work passive.

In short, any basic construction project must be "correctly planned," "correctly designed," and "correctly constructed." Not a single step can be wrong. If it is wrong, it will inevitably lead to rework and waste. Among the errors that have already occurred in basic construction, some are not simply due to one reason. Among them, there are more cases where both design and construction have problems. In addition to the above three aspects having some problems, there is another type, which is to carry out construction without going through the approved procedures. For example, a factory in Taiyuan had such problems during construction last year, and as a result, it used money from other sources to墊上, and the work became very passive.

(II)

The reason why some errors have occurred in basic construction is due to complex and multifaceted factors in general.

The many factors that constitute errors can be summarized into two aspects, namely objective and subjective, and the two are mutually influential and even mutually causal in actual work. We do have many problems in these two areas.

Objective difficulties generally exist. Such as insufficient experience, insufficient manpower, insufficient financial resources, unclear resource situation, insufficient investigation and research equipment, insufficient manufacturing capacity, lack of standard specifications for building materials, lack of standard design, etc. These difficulties are historical and can only be overcome gradually by creating conditions.

For specific basic construction projects, objective difficulties include the following: urgent tasks, multiple levels of approval of plans and therefore delays, slow allocation of funds, improper coordination of various related tasks (such as material supply not coordinated with construction, design not coordinated with construction, transportation not coordinated, orders cannot be delivered on time, etc.), poor design agency capabilities, and irregular enterprise management, and other work tasks are very busy, etc. These difficulties are mostly man-made and should be investigated to find out the reasons and improve them quickly.

Subjective reasons belong to the ideological and attitudinal problems of those who guide or implement basic construction tasks. For example, rashly deciding on issues without objectively assessing needs and possibilities, not paying attention to investigation and research, unwilling to seriously conduct design, sloppy construction, lack of active creation and improvement in work, etc.

(III)

The attitude of "acting hastily" and "irresponsibility" is the main reason why errors occur in basic construction.

Objective reasons can only have the possibility of errors occurring, but this possibility only becomes a reality when subjective deviations occur. For example: If we are building a new type of enterprise and have not designed it before (there is objectively a possibility of poor design), but we insist on designing it ourselves (subjective guidance), the result is that the design is wrong or the design fails. Is this result due to subjective reasons or objective reasons? It is very clear that the guiding ideology in the subjective aspect is wrong. Some people say that this view is wrong and negates creativity. For example, we are not carpenters or bricklayers, but we can build houses ourselves; although they are not good, they are still usable houses. The problem lies here: large buildings and large enterprises cannot be "just about right," but cannot be even a little bit off. It is possible to use more or fewer rafters to build an ordinary house, and to use this kind of wood or that kind of wood, rough or delicate rafters; but a precision machine cannot be used if it is missing a part.

The first task of subjective guidance is to fully study objective difficulties, assess one's own strength (possibilities), and determine the direction of action in combination with needs. Objective conditions should be mastered by the subjective, and objective conditions must not be ignored without basis.

Why do we say that the main reason for errors in basic construction is "acting hastily"? From the existing facts, we can see that some comrades dealt with the objectively existing difficulties with a "hasty" attitude, generally manifested as "underestimating and acting rashly," and as a result, problems occurred. Some comrades dealt with the complex problems in their work with a "hasty" attitude and did not seriously study or analyze them, and as a result, the work was not well coordinated or they took care of one thing but lost sight of another, and problems also occurred. For example: The "serious task" problem: The fact that the task is serious does exist. Some tasks are indeed serious, such as harnessing the Huai River, and certain projects must be completed before the flood season, otherwise, the previous efforts may be in vain. And general basic construction is not so "serious" in the first place, but it is also made "serious." "Serious" is in the design staff, construction staff, and even supply staff and finance staff, that is, there are few people and a lot of work, and the deadline is to be completed. What should be done? If they are not up to the task, some will be perfunctory, and as a result, errors occur. Or they may delay the matter, or they may have to rework, wasting resources. Let's analyze how this "serious" situation is created. From the national perspective (referring to the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Financial and Economic Committee), there has been no order in the past to complete a certain amount of general basic construction (this can be done in the future), but rather, they are afraid that the lower levels do not have sufficient conditions and capabilities to undertake too many tasks, so they strictly control investment and guide work and educate staff with the policy of planned, step-by-step and steady construction. However, some industrial departments and some leading cadres have obviously different emotions, that is, they are afraid that there will be less investment and fewer things approved to be done. This can be seen from the investment control figures decided in the past. This emotion becomes more and more serious as it goes down, that is, the requirements put forward by enterprises each time are very large. Generally, they have been compressed once in the industrial bureau, but they are still not small; when they are raised to the ministry, there is another debate, and as a result, they are reduced again; but what the ministry submits to the Central Financial and Economic Committee is still not small; the Financial and Economic Committee finally checks and reduces it again. Of course, this does not mean that all levels are completely blindly asking for money. Indeed, some projects that should be done and can be done have to be postponed due to the limitations of financial capacity. But assuming that serious tasks occur after this, leading to a lack of strength, then who is responsible? Isn't it precisely because the enterprises themselves want to do more things that this is caused? If this situation occurs, it should be said that this is "hasty" in determining investment requirements and tasks. Of course, this is not necessarily entirely the responsibility of the enterprise or the department requesting basic construction, and some may be the responsibility of their leading agency. This situation becomes an objective difficulty for those who implement specific work!

The problem of slow approval of budgets and allocation of funds: Some comrades pointed out that one of the objective difficulties is the slow approval of budgets and allocation of funds. The phenomenon of slow budget approval does exist. It is very important to go through certain approvals for basic construction. Firstly, the higher level considers a wider range and thus takes care of the overall situation, and secondly, approval is a serious issue of responsibility. Approval at each level also means that each level is responsible. Budget approval is the approval of the task, and the delay in approval also means the delay in determining the task. This should not be a big problem for enterprises. If there is a problem, it may be a seasonal hindrance to construction projects. For example, the rainy season and freezing season in China are generally not suitable for construction. If the approval of the budget does not take this issue into account, it will affect the construction, or even delay it, then it will have to be done next season or next year. If the comrades working in the higher-level organs do not pay attention to this and adopt a hasty attitude towards the requirements of the lower levels, it is not right. And if the reason for the late approval of the budget is that the budget itself has problems, but instead of distinguishing the reasons, they complain about the higher level, then it is the enterprise's own fault, and it should be prevented in the future. Judging from the existing situation, another impact of slow approval is that some basic construction projects have already started before the budget is approved, that is, before the task is formally approved. In this way, the slow approval of the budget or the delay in the allocation of funds will naturally greatly hinder the progress of the project. The reason is not entirely that the approval is slow, but that the start is too hasty. This approach should also be regarded as a "hasty" attitude.

Regarding the problem of lack of cooperation in work: For example, the untimely supply of materials becomes an objective difficulty for the construction staff. But if you take an enterprise unit as an example, it shows a lack of rigorous work organization in carrying out basic construction. The supply department may have its "objective difficulties," but overall, there must be "haste" in the organization and coordination of all work, so that the responsibilities are unclear and the work on all sides cannot be effectively linked.

The above points are largely due to insufficient estimation of one's own capabilities, which causes branches and difficulties in the work process.

"Irresponsibility" is an issue of attitude towards work. For example:

In design, they are only formally responsible, but they are not responsible for the results. They are unwilling to conduct thorough investigation and research, and only conduct design based on general information, and as a result, problems occur during or after construction. There are such examples in the materials published in the People's Daily. There is also a phenomenon of not taking full responsibility in design, that is, only designing part of it, not making the entire design. For example, only designing the house, not making internal designs, such as heating, sanitation, lighting, water supply and drainage, etc., are all left to the construction staff (this is how it was in the past), and people are hired again to do it. There is also a hasty attitude in the use of materials. For example, the very common tendency of "using large materials for small purposes" is a hasty attitude.

"Irresponsibility" in construction. It is undeniable that some public organs or individuals have regarded construction companies as profitable undertakings, so they have been established one after another. Some of them are aimed at meeting construction needs, while others are purely for profit. With a profit-oriented view, it is easy to be sloppy in construction, not strictly pay attention to quality, and even cut corners. The disguised feudal contractor system still exists, and it is difficult for workers to actively take responsibility for the quality of the project under this exploitation. This is a major problem in current basic construction.

The emergence of a hasty and insufficiently responsible attitude has its ideological roots. Most comrades are enthusiastic about national construction and engage in work with a high degree of enthusiasm, which is very valuable and should continue to be developed. But because of this, some comrades have made the mistake of being too hasty, not paying attention to creating conditions but eagerly seeking success, so they act easily, which is the main root of forming a hasty approach. A hasty approach lacks comprehensive consideration in its thinking methods, only looking at the part and not the whole, and mostly starting from subjective wishes, not conforming to objective reality. Some other comrades do not have a very correct attitude towards the attitude that should be possessed in engaging in the people's cause, that is, they are not thoroughly responsible, but still have some degree of employment viewpoint. Therefore, an irresponsible or insufficiently responsible attitude has been formed. We believe that these are two problems that should be opposed in basic construction. We should strive to strengthen our learning to establish correct thinking methods and work attitudes, and create due achievements for future work.

(IV)

The following main problems need to be solved in the current work:

1. The review and approval of budgets and the allocation of funds should be timely. First of all, the compilers of the budget should prepare it in a realistic manner in accordance with the procedures. According to the reflection of the planning work department, the reason for the slow approval in the past was indeed that the budget itself had problems. Secondly, the higher-level organs should clearly define the division of labor in the degree of review, so as to avoid each level generally reviewing it in the same way. Although this solves the problem of responsibility, it is easy to fall into formalism, and the result is easy to delay time, and therefore the allocation of funds is also delayed. The delay in the allocation of funds affects the construction, making it impossible to spend the funds within the scheduled time, and they will inevitably be turned over at the end of the year.

2. There should be clear and specific provisions for the policy of restoring and developing each enterprise. Our past work has the shortcomings of insufficient clarity and specificity in policies, which makes it difficult for enterprises to have work indicators and to be proactive.

3. Enterprises should strictly abide by the established procedures for carrying out basic construction work, and strive to learn basic construction in actual work.

4. The relevant departments should pay attention to solving the problems existing in construction companies (including state-owned and private ones), which has a significant impact on current basic construction.

5. The state should designate a special agency to comprehensively consider the unified use of architectural design capabilities. At present, it can also plan to organize several design agencies with complete design capabilities. In addition, the standardization of building materials should also be started with the important ones.

★ ★ ★

Finally, we believe that basic construction is a major event for the country and is the central link in the country's life in the future. And now it is not yet the beginning of large-scale construction. We should attach importance to the shortcomings and errors that have already occurred, seriously review them, and thereby gain experience and lessons, and earnestly learn in the current work to prepare conditions for future work. Learning should start with correcting our thinking, otherwise, it will be difficult to objectively criticize errors. Therefore, we feel that: (1) Local newspapers should launch a discussion on this issue. (2) Party organizations should call on party members engaged in enterprise work to actively participate in the discussion. (3) The relevant administrative departments should, based on the notice of the Central Financial and Economic Committee on inspecting basic construction, conduct in-depth discussions among cadres over a longer period of time (not limited to July) to expose problems from multiple perspectives and gradually deepen the discussion.

　　目前基本建设中的几个问题
    中央重工业部办公厅副主任　崔中
    人民日报开展了对基本建设中某些错误的批评和讨论之后，我们在工业部门中工作的同志，除了参加由行政方面组织的讨论之外，还有不少人自动地组织了和正在组织着对基本建设问题的讨论。大家都觉得这样的讨论与结合实际的检讨，对目前和今后的工作都会有极大的帮助。
    我们所已经进行的和正在进行的基本建设，还不是国家大规模新建设的开始，其重点仍是恢复与适当发展旧有企业。在这一阶段中的基本建设的任务，不仅是把旧企业的恢复与某些发展的工作做好，尤其重要的在于训练人员、积累经验，争取提早学会进行基本建设，以迎接新的更大的建设任务。
    我们虽有不少进行建设的有利条件，例如，中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，广大人民尤其是从事企业工作的职工的积极性，丰富的资源，以及社会主义国家与各新民主主义国家的大力支持等等，并且正由于这些有利条件，已使我们的基本建设获得了重大成绩；但我们也还有许多困难条件，主要是还缺乏进行建设的经验、人力、财力、物力都还不够充分。这些困难虽是暂时的，但却直接影响着当前的工作。因之，在基本建设中发生某些错误是可以想像得到的。但问题的关键在于应如何认真地分析检讨已经发生的错误，从而取得经验，提高能力，使今后不犯或少犯错误。我们在讨论中，初步认识了基本建设中的几个问题，愿意提出来作为大家讨论这个问题的参考。
  （一）
    基本建设中已经发生的偏差与错误，分别地表现在三个方面：即计划方面、设计方面和施工方面。
    有的基本建设工程是在计划上出了毛病。这里所指的“计划”就是决定办什么事。譬如要建设一个工厂、矿山或楼房。决定做什么必须有根据，首先是需要与否，其次是资源、财力、人力及其他经济条件等。倘若计划不周或发生错误，则设计就无可靠的根据，这样设计的结果就会枉费心机；假如施了工，浪费就更大。我们有改变计划的例子，譬如，去年根据条件决定建设一个制造甲产品（假定名称）的工厂，随即集中专家进行设计，已工作一年；现在对这种产品发生了疑问，经过多方讨论一致认为不如制造乙产品（假定名称）更合乎国家的需要，于是决定改变，以前的设计就无用了，从新开始。另如定襄铁矿的例子（人民日报七月五日发表），据我们所知系掌握资源材料不确，在设计、施工至开工后，发现铁矿矿层为斜下伸状，开采费力，且含铁成份低，目前价值不大，前后进行两年，近已决定停工。
    有的基本建设工程是在设计上出了毛病。“设计”是实现计划的具体方案。如建设一个企业或其一部分，则设计有两个部分，即建筑部分与机械装备部分。我们所已经施工的主要为建筑部分，这里发生的乱子最多，人民日报揭发的例子主要是这一方面的，不必再列举。总之，是设计草率、盲目施工，造成返工与浪费。
    有的基本建设工程是在施工上出了毛病。有了“正确设计”还必须有“正确施工”。“设计”还是纸面上的，而“施工”则是行动。行动错了就直接造成物质损失。如天津某工厂，去年建设一座厂房和一个水池，两者相隔甚近（不足二尺），完工后池底裂开不能储水，查明原因是包工者用料（洋灰）不好，未照顾两者不同的压力所致。施工中的其他毛病还有，如各项工作步骤配合不密切，以致延误时日，浪费人力物力，工作被动等。
    总之，进行任何基本建设工程，必须是“正确计划”，“正确设计”和“正确施工”。一步也不能错。错了，必然返工浪费。目前基本建设中所已发生的错误，有的并不单纯是一个原因。其中，由于设计和施工同时有毛病者较多。除上述三方面均曾出了些毛病之外，还有另一种，就是未经过批准的程序而自行施工，如像太原某厂在去年进行建设时就有过这样问题，结果是用了别方面的钱垫上，工作弄得很被动。
  （二）
    基本建设之所以发生了若干错误，在总的方面说是有着复杂的多方面的因素的。
    构成错误的许多因素，可以概括为两个方面，即客观的与主观的两方面，而两者在实际工作中又是相互影响的甚至是互为因果的。我们在这两方面确有不少问题。
    客观困难，一般地说是有的。如经验不足，人力不足，财力不足，资源情况不明，调查研究设备不够，制造能力不够，建筑材料缺乏标准规格缺乏标准设计等等。这些困难是有历史性的，只有努力创造条件，逐渐加以克服。
    客观困难，对于具体的基本建设工程来说，有以下各种：任务紧迫，批准计划层次多因而迟缓，拨款迟缓，各有关工作配合不妥（譬如材料供应与施工不配合，设计与施工不配合，运输不配合，定货不能按期交货等等），设计机构能力差，以及企业管理尚不正规，其他工作任务又十分忙迫等等。这些困难多属人为性的，应当查明原因迅速改善。
    主观原因，则属于指导或执行基本建设任务者的思想问题，态度问题。譬如，不客观地估计需要与可能而冒然决定问题，不重视调查研究，不愿认真进行设计，施工马虎，工作中缺乏积极的创造与改进等等。
  （三）
    “草率从事”和“不负责任”的态度，是基本建设中之所以发生错误的主要原因。
    客观原因只能是有发生错误的可能性，但这种可能性只有在主观上发生偏差时才成为现实性。譬如：建设某一新型企业，我们没有设计过（客观上存在了设计不好的可能性），却硬要自己设计（主观指导），结果设计错了或设计不成。这个结果是由于主观原因呢？还是由于客观原因？很明白，是主观上的指导思想错了。有人讲，这样看法是不对的，是抹杀创造性的看法，譬如我们并不是木匠和泥瓦匠，但我们能自己把房子盖起来；虽然不好，但总归是可以使用的房子。问题就在这里，大建筑大企业，却并不是“差不多”就行，而是差一点也不行。盖一个普通房子却可以多用或少用几根椽子，可以用这样的木料或那样的木料，粗糙的或精致的椽子；而一部精密的机器去掉一个零件就不能使用。
    主观指导的第一个任务就是充分研究客观的困难，估计自己的力量（可能性），结合需要确定行动的方针。应使客观条件为主观所掌握，而决不能无根据地忽视客观条件。
    为什么说基本建设中之所以发生错误，其主要原因是由于“草率从事”呢？从已有的事实中，我们可以看出，有的同志是以“草率”的态度处理了客观存在的困难，其表现一般是“估计不足，而冒然从事”，结果出了毛病。有的同志则是以“草率”的态度处理工作中复杂问题不去认真钻研、分析，结果工作配合不好或顾此失彼，也出了毛病。譬如：“任务严重”问题：任务严重的事实的确存在。有的任务确是严重，如像根治淮河，某些工程必须在洪水期之前完成，否则可能前功尽弃。而一般的基本建设本来并不是这么“严重”的，但却也弄成“严重”的了。“严重”在设计人员、施工人员，以至供应人员、财务人员身上，即所谓人少活重，限期完成，怎么办呢？力不胜任，有的就马虎潦草，结果发生了错误。或为延期误事，或为返工浪费等等。我们试分析一下这种“严重”的情况是如何造成的呢？从国家说（指中央人民政府政务院与财政经济委员会）以往并没有对一般基本建设限令必须完成多少（以后可以这样），而是惟恐下级条件不足能力不足担负不了太多的任务，因而严格控制投资，并以有计划有步骤稳步建设的方针来指导工作和教育工作人员。可是有的工业部门和某些领导干部，却有显然不同的情绪了，就是惟恐投资少和批准让办的事少。这从历次决定投资控制数字时就可以看出。这种情绪愈往下愈严重，就是说企业每次提出的要求都很大，一般在工业局里已压缩过一次，但还不小；提到部以后，又是一场争论，结果又减少一次；但部向中央财政经济委员会提出的，依然不小；财政经济委员会最后再核减一回。这当然不是说各级都是完全盲目要钱，确实有些应办和能办的工程由于财政能力的限制而不得不缓办。但假定说在此后发生了任务严重以致力所不及时，那么由谁来负责呢？不恰恰是由于企业自己要多办事而造成的吗？如果发生这种情况，应当说这是对投资要求与任务确定的“草率”。当然这并不一定完全由企业或要求基本建设的部门负责，有的可能应由其领导机关负责。这样情况就成为执行具体工作者的客观困难了！
    批准预算和拨款迟缓问题：有些同志提出客观困难之一为批准预算和拨款迟缓问题。批准预算慢的现象是有的。进行基本建设经过一定的批准是十分重要的，一则上级考虑范围较宽广从而照顾全局，再则批准是一个严肃的责任问题，逐级批准亦即逐级负了责。预算批准才是任务的批准，批的迟也就是任务决定的迟。这本来不应成为企业的大问题的，如有问题可能是季节性对建筑工程的妨害。譬如雨季与冰冻季在中国一般不适宜兴土木，如预算之批准未照顾这个问题，势将影响施工，甚或拖迟，那只好下一季或明年再办了。假若上级机关工作的同志不重视这一点，对下面的要求采取草率的态度，是不应该的。而如果预算迟批的原因，是由于预算本身有毛病，却不加区别地埋怨上级，则是企业自己的错误，今后尤应防止。从已有的情况看，批准迟缓发生另一种影响，即有的基本建设工程在预算批准，亦即任务正式核准之前已经动手了。这样预算迟批或拨款迟了自然使工程的进行受到很大阻难。究其原因却不完全是批的迟，而是动手过急。这种做法亦应视为“草率”的态度。
    关于工作中互不配合的问题：譬如材料供应不及时，就成为施工者的客观困难。但如拿一个企业单位来说，则表现对进行基本建设缺乏严密的工作组织。供应部门或许有他的“客观困难”，总起来则是组织全部工作的配合上必有“草率”，以致责任不明，使各方面工作不能有效地联系。
    上述几点，大体上是由于对自己的能力估计不足，而使工作过程中发生枝节与困难。
    “不负责任”，是对工作的态度问题。譬如：
    在设计上只是形式地负了责，而对其结果如何则不负责，不愿进行周密的调查研究，只根据一般的资料就进行设计，结果在施工时或施工后发生问题。人民日报发表的材料中就有此类例子。设计上还有一种不负全责的现象，就是只管设计一部分，未作全部的设计。如只设计房子，不作内部设计，如暖汽、卫生、照明、上下水等设备全不管，而是让施工的人管（过去就是如此），重新找人做。在材料的使用上，也有草率态度。如甚为普遍的“大材小用”的倾向，就是草率从事的态度。
    施工中的“不负责任”。不可否认，有的公家机关或私人，已把建筑公司视为有利可图的事业了，于是纷纷成立，其目的有的是为适应建设需要，有的却是单纯为了盈利。既有盈利观点，就容易发生施工草率不严格注重质量甚至偷工减料的倾向。变相的封建把头制依然存在，劳动者在这种剥削之下，也是难以积极对工程质量负责的。这是目前在基本建设中的一个大问题。
    产生草率从事与不够负责的态度，是有其思想根源的。大多数同志热心于国家建设，以高度的积极性从事工作，这是十分可贵的，应当继续发挥这种精神。但因此有些同志却犯了过急的毛病，不注重创造条件而急欲求成，以致轻易行动，这是形成草率从事的主要根源。草率从事，在思想方法上是缺乏全面的考虑，只看局部不看整体，多从主观愿望出发，不切合客观的实际。另有一些同志，对于从事人民事业应具备的态度，还不十分正确，即还不是彻底负责的，而是还有着某种程度的雇佣观点。因之，形成了不负责任或不够负责的态度。我们认为，这是基本建设中应当反对的两个问题。我们应当努力加强学习，以树立正确的思想方法和工作态度，为今后的工作创造应有的成绩。
        （四）
    目前工作中须要解决下面几个主要问题：
    一、审核和批准预算以及拨款应当及时。首先要预算的编制者应按照程序实事求是的编好。据计划工作部门的反映，以往迟批的原因，有的确系预算本身有问题。其次，上级机关应明确定出审核程度的分工，以免各级都一般地照样审一次，这样虽然解决了责任问题，但容易流于形式主义，其结果则易延误时间，因之拨款也迟。迟拨款了，就影响施工，使经费在预定时间之内用不完，到年终势必上缴。
    二、对于每一企业的恢复和发展的方针应有明确具体的规定。我们以往的工作有方针不够明确、具体的缺点，这样就使企业缺乏工作指标，不易主动。
    三、企业应严格遵守既定的进行基本建设工作程序，努力在实际工作中学会基本建设。
    四、建筑公司（包括国家的与私人的）中存在的问题，有关部门应注意解决，它对目前的基本建设有重大的影响。
    五、国家应指定专门机关通盘考虑建筑设计能力的统筹使用问题，在目前并可有计划地组织若干有完整设计能力的设计机构。另外关于建筑材料的标准化亦应择其重要者着手进行。
    ★          ★        ★
    最后，我们认为基本建设是国家的大事，是今后国家生活的中心环节。而现在还并非大规模建设的开始，我们应当重视已经发生的缺点和错误，认真检讨，从而取得经验和教训，认真在现在进行的工作中老老实实地学习，为今后的工作准备条件。进行学习应从端正思想入手，否则难以客观地批判错误。因此，我们觉得：（一）各地报纸都应开展对这一问题的讨论。（二）党的组织应号召从事企业工作的党员积极参加讨论。（三）有关行政部门应就中央财政经济委员会关于检查基本建设的通知，以较长的时间（不限于七月份）在干部中进行深入的讨论，以从多方面揭发问题，使讨论逐步深入。
