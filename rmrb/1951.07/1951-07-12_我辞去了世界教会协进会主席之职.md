　　I Resigned from the Presidency of the World Council of Churches
    Zhao Zichen

　　In July 1950, the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches held a meeting in Ottawa, Canada, and issued a statement accusing North Korea of being the aggressor and questioning the true motives of the Stockholm Peace Appeal. From the time this statement was issued until the day I resigned from the presidency of the World Council of Churches, neither the Central Committee nor the General Secretary of the Council sent me a letter to inform me of the statement. It was only around February or March of this year that I saw a fragment of that absurd statement in a magazine. This point also makes me feel deeply disgusted.

　　The World Council of Churches was established in August 1948, with more than 150 Christian churches worldwide as members. At that time, the Preparatory Committee sought the consent of delegations from the Philippines, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Burma, India, Africa, Latin America, etc., and nominated me as one of the six presidents to represent the emerging churches. There are many progressive elements in the emerging churches who are uncompromising with imperialism, and I, representing them, was of course duty-bound. The other five presidents, one represented the American churches, one represented the British churches, two represented the European churches, and one represented the Orthodox churches.

　　After returning to China in September 1948, I have not attended a single meeting of the Presidium, nor have I been to the Central Committee. I repeatedly wanted to resign, but I was always afraid of failing the emerging churches in the Philippines, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Burma, India, Africa, Latin America, etc., so it did not immediately become a reality. From April 16th to 21st this year, the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council convened a meeting to deal with Christian organizations accepting American subsidies. My participation in this meeting increased my vigilance and made me deeply disgusted with American imperialism's use of the World Council of Churches to carry out its aggressive policies. After returning to school, I immediately discussed with my colleagues and decided to resign. The letter of resignation was sent on April 28th this year, and it was a protest. The letter said: To the Presidium:

　　Last July, the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches issued a statement accusing North Korea of being the aggressor and questioning the motives of the Stockholm World Peace Conference's peace appeal. This statement placed me in an inexplicable position, because on the one hand I am one of the presidents of the World Council of Churches, and on the other hand I am a loyal people of the People's Republic of China. Recently, I have felt even more impossible to remain in this position. Since I am a patriotic Chinese people, I cannot but protest against the Toronto statement—this statement sounds so much like the voice of Wall Street—while being a president seems to require endorsing such words. I can no longer be the president of the World Council. Therefore, I resign and request that my name be completely removed from the various committees of the Council in which I participate. As I do so, I want to say that I have complete freedom to affirm my faith and loyalty to our Savior Jesus Christ.

### 我辞去了世界教会协进会主席之职

　　我辞去了世界教会协进会主席之职
    赵紫宸
    一九五○年七月世界教会协进会中央委员会在加拿大的京城开会，公布了一个文告，指责北朝鲜为侵略者，并怀疑斯德哥尔摩的和平呼吁的真正动机。从这文告公布到我辞世界教会协进会主席之日，中央委员会或协进会总干事竟没有来函将文告通知我。约在本年二三月间，我才在一个杂志上看见那荒谬文告的片段。这一点也是使我痛恶的。
    世界教会协进会是一九四八年八月间成立的，内中有全世界一百五十余个基督教教会为会员。当时筹备委员会征求了菲律宾、日本、朝鲜、印尼、缅甸、印度、非洲、拉丁美洲等代表团的同意，提我为六主席之一，以我代表后起教会。后起教会里有许多前进分子，都是与帝国主义不妥协的，我代表他们，当然义不容辞。其他五个主席，一个代表美国教会，一个代表英国教会，两个代表欧洲教会，一个代表东正教教会。
    一九四八年九月回国之后，我不曾参加过一次主席团的会议，也不曾到过中央委员会。我屡欲辞职，总因恐怕对不起菲律宾、日本、朝鲜、印尼、缅甸、印度、非洲、拉丁美洲等后起教会，没有立即成为事实。本年四月十六至二十一日政务院文教委员会宗教事务处召集了处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议，我参加了，使我增加了警惕，深深地痛恶美帝国主义利用了世界教会协进会进行其侵略政策。回到学校之后，我即与同事们商量，决定辞职。辞职的信是本年四月二十八日发的，是一个抗议。信上说：主席团：
    去年七月世界教会协进会中央委员会公布一个文告，指责北朝鲜为侵略者，并怀疑斯德哥尔摩世界和平会议的和平呼吁的动机。这个文告将我置于莫明其妙的地位，因为一方面我是世界教会协进会主席之一，另一方面我是中华人民共和国忠实的人民。近来我更觉得居留在这种地位上的不可能。我既是一个爱国的中国人民，自不能不对于托朗托的文告提出抗议——这个文告多么像华尔街的口吻——而做了一个主席却好像应当是赞成这种言词的。我不能再做世界协进会的主席了。因此，我辞职并请将我的姓名从我所参加的协进会的各种委员会上完全勾消。我这样做的时候，我要说我有全部自由肯定我对于吾救主耶稣基督的信仰与忠心。
