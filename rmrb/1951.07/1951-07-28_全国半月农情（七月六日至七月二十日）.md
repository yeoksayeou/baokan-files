　　National Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation
　　(July 6 to July 20)
　　Xinhua News Agency
　　In the half-month from July 6th to July 20th, the summer production in most parts of the country is nearing its end. The early rice harvest has begun in provinces south of the Yangtze River; cotton, jute, and major autumn crops are growing well in various regions, and the vast number of farmers are stepping up pest control and weeding. Flood and flood prevention has entered a tense stage.

  Early Rice Harvested in Provinces South of the Yangtze River
　　Early rice in East China, Central South, and Southwest regions generally reported a bumper harvest. Early rice in the Central South region can yield between 200 and 350 jin per mu. Early rice production in Hunan and Fujian provinces increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. Currently, early rice harvesting has begun in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan, and has already started in warmer provinces such as Guangxi, Guangdong, and Yunnan. Early rice in Fujian, Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and southern Sichuan provinces and regions is now ripe, and farmers everywhere are actively purchasing farm tools such as sickles in preparation for the harvest.

  Various Crops Grow Well
　　Since July, timely rains have fallen in Central South, East China, Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast regions, with abundant rainfall. The drought situation in various regions has been basically alleviated, and various crops are growing well. Cotton in Central South and Southwest regions is growing vigorously, and the cotton fields are lush green. Cotton plants in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces are as tall as two to three chi; cotton in Henan province has grown five to ten fruiting branches and more than twenty flower buds; cotton in western Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and Fujian provinces and regions has begun to bud, and some have already blossomed. Jute in Zhejiang, eastern Sichuan, and western Sichuan is more than three chi tall, with lush leaves and strong branches; jute in Fujian province has begun to be harvested. Major autumn crops such as millet and sorghum in Northeast China and Henan province are shiny and green, reaching three chi in height, and late autumn crops sown in Gansu and Shaanxi have emerged.

　　In order to strive for a bumper harvest of various crops, farmers everywhere are stepping up weeding and fertilization. Cotton fields in East China, Northeast China, and Southwest China have been weeded two to three times, and cotton fields in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi in Central South and North China have been weeded five or six times. The aforementioned cotton fields have also been universally top-dressed with fertilizer. Early autumn crops in various regions have also been weeded once, and sorghum and millet in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Pingyuan and other provinces and regions have been weeded three to five times.

  Various Regions Step Up Pest Control
　　In the past half month, farmers in various regions have vigorously fought against pests and achieved remarkable results. Hebei, Pingyuan, northern Anhui, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Xinjiang provinces and regions have mobilized millions of farmers to kill locust nymphs. Now, the locust nymphs in the above-mentioned regions have been basically eliminated, and only a few regions have locust nymphs that have turned into flying locusts, harming crops. In addition to continuing to lead farmers in vigorously catching and killing locusts, local people's governments have also mobilized the masses to inspect and dig out locust eggs to prevent the occurrence of autumn locusts.

　　Currently, cotton aphids are breeding rapidly in various regions. Many cotton fields in Hebei Province have been infested with cotton aphids, and cotton fields in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, western Liaoning, and other provinces have also been infested with cotton aphids. In addition, rice stem borers are severely damaging rice paddies in provinces south of the Yangtze River. Local people's governments are now mobilizing farmers to vigorously eliminate and control pests. The people's governments of Henan and Shandong provinces have distributed a large number of medicines and machinery to various regions to help farmers eliminate pests. Provinces in Northeast China have also universally established pest control organizations at all levels. Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan and other provinces have also launched mass pest-catching campaigns. After pest control in various regions, the degree of damage has been greatly reduced. The 2 million mu of cotton seedlings in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, which had suffered from cotton aphid damage, have now largely turned green and recovered after pest control. Rice stem borers in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan have stopped spreading.

  Flood and Flood Prevention Has Entered a Tense Stage
　　With the rainy season approaching, flood and flood prevention in various regions has entered a tense stage. In the first ten days of this month, heavy rains fell continuously in the Southwest and East China regions, and the water levels of various rivers and lakes rose sharply, mountain floods broke out, and river embankments breached, causing some areas to suffer from floods or waterlogging. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2 million mu of rice and cotton fields in parts of southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui were flooded, and more than 20,000 mu of cotton fields in seven counties including northern Sichuan were flooded. Currently, in addition to mobilizing the masses to drain water and rescue flooded crops, local people's governments have also established and strengthened flood prevention organizations. Provinces and counties in Northeast China have successively established flood prevention organizations to plan and supervise flood prevention work in various regions. Liaoxi Province has prepared all flood prevention and rescue equipment and has established a rescue team. In addition, Jilin and Songjiang provinces have also organized the masses to inspect dikes and repair dangerous works. People along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province have formed flood prevention and rescue teams to defend the dikes day and night.

　　In the second half of the month, the key tasks of agricultural production in various regions, in addition to continuing pest control, weeding, and fertilization, should also include mobilizing the masses to inspect dikes, repair dangerous works, strengthen flood prevention organizations, and prevent floods.

　　全国半月农情
　　（七月六日至七月二十日）
    七月六日至七月二十日的半个月，全国大部地区的夏季生产将近结束。长江以南各省早稻已开始收割；各地棉花、黄麻和大秋作物成长良好，广大农民正在加紧防治虫害和中耕锄草。防涝防汛已进入紧张阶段。
  长江以南各省收割早稻
    华东、中南和西南等区的早稻普告丰收。中南区的早稻每亩可收二百斤至三百五十斤。湖南、福建两省早稻产量较去年增产一成至二成。目前，湖北、江西、湖南早稻已开始收割，气候较暖的广西、广东、云南等省的早稻业已登场。福建、浙江、皖南和川南等省区的早稻现已成熟，各地农民正在纷纷购买镰刀等农具，准备收割。
  各种作物成长良好
    七月以来，中南、华东、西南、西北和东北区普降时雨，雨量充沛，各地旱象已基本解除，各种作物成长良好。中南、西南等区的棉花生长旺盛，棉田一片油绿。江西、湖南两省棉棵高达二尺至三尺；河南省的棉花已长出五至十个果枝，二十多枚花蕾，川西、川东和福建等省区的棉花已开始孕蕾，有的已经开花。浙江、川东和川西等地的黄麻已有三尺多高，叶肥枝壮；福建省的黄麻已开始收割。东北区和河南省的大秋作物谷子、高粱油绿发光，高达三尺，甘肃、陕西播种的晚秋作物已经出苗。
    为着争取各种作物丰收，各地农民正在加紧锄草和施肥。华东、东北、西南等区的棉田已锄草二遍至三遍，中南和华北区的河北、平原、山西的棉田已锄草五、六次，上述各地的棉田并已普遍施过追肥。各地早秋作物也已锄过头遍草，山东、河南、河北、平原等省区的高粱、谷子已锄草三次至五次。
  各地加紧扑灭虫害
    半月以来，各地农民大力扑灭虫害，并获得显著成绩。河北、平原、皖北、山东、苏北、河南和新疆等省区共动员了数百万农民扑杀蝗蝻。现在，上述地区的蝗蝻基本上已被扑灭，仅有少数地区的蝗蝻已变成飞蝗，为害禾苗。各地人民政府除继续领导农民大力捕打外，并发动群众检查和挖掘蝗卵，以防止秋蝗的发生。
    目前，各地棉蚜滋生很快，河北省已有许多棉田发生棉蚜，江西、湖北、湖南、河南、辽西等省棉田也发生棉蚜。此外，长江以南各省稻田的螟虫为害很严重。各地人民政府现正发动农民大力除治。河南、山东两省人民政府已发放给各地大批药械，帮助农民除虫。东北区各省亦普遍建立了各级防虫组织。山西、河北、平原等省并展开了群众性的捕虫运动。各地害虫经除治后，为害程度已大大减轻。陕西关中地区曾遭受棉蚜之害的二百万亩棉苗，经除虫后，现已大部发绿复苏。湖北、江西和湖南螟虫已停止蔓延。
  防涝防汛已进入紧张阶段
    雨季将到，各地的防汛、防涝已进入紧张阶段。西南、华东两区本月上旬连降大雨，各河、湖水位陡涨，山洪暴发，河堤溃决，致使部分地区酿成水灾或内涝。据不完全统计，苏南、皖南和苏北、皖北部分地区有二百多万亩稻禾、棉田被水淹没，川北等七县被淹棉田二万多亩。现各地人民政府除动员群众排水抢救被淹禾苗外，并建立和加强了防汛组织。东北区各省、县已先后成立了防汛组织，筹划和督导各地进行防汛工作。辽西省已将一切防汛抢险器材准备齐全，并成立了抢险大队。此外，吉林、松江两省亦组织群众检查堤坝，补修险工。湖北省沿长江两岸地区的群众，已组成防汛抢险队，昼夜在堤上防守。
    下半月各地农业生产上的紧要任务，除继续进行防治虫害和锄草施肥外，还应发动群众检查堤坝，补修险工，加强防汛组织，防止水灾发生。
