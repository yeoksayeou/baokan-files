　　Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen: TASS reports that Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, arrived in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, on the 26th on his way from Helsinki to Paris. Joliot-Curie spoke to a reporter from the Danish Communist Party's newspaper, "Land and People," about the achievements of the Helsinki meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council. He said: The World Peace Council's view of conducting negotiations to replace resorting to force has increasingly attracted people's attention, because in the eyes of the broad masses of people, this view is completely correct. In the first few years after the war, people all over the world placed great hope in the United Nations, but when the principle of unanimity among the great powers was abandoned and problems began to be solved by a simple majority, the United Nations Charter was undoubtedly violated. As a result, the votes of small countries were obtained through bribery and threats. It is these small countries that recognize that the principle of unanimity among the great powers is the only guarantee of their independence and freedom. Our demand that the five major powers conduct negotiations to conclude a peace treaty means a genuine restoration of the foundation upon which the people trust the United Nations.
　　Joliot-Curie went on to say: We have great hopes for the International Economic Conference to be held in Moscow at the end of this year. A broadly representative committee is preparing for the conference. We hope that representatives from all walks of life outside our organizational system will also participate in this conference. This conference will be based on the principle that socialism and capitalism can coexist peacefully. We are eager to prove how much benefit a peaceful economy can bring to all aspects of life.

　　约里奥—居里接见丹麦记者
　  谈赫尔辛基会议成就
　  对国际经济会议寄予很大希望
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社哥本哈根讯：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在由赫尔辛基返巴黎途中，于二十六日到达丹麦京城哥本哈根。约里奥—居里向丹麦共产党机关报《国土与人民》报记者谈述了世界和平理事会执行局赫尔辛基会议的成就。他说：世界和平理事会关于进行谈判以代替诉诸武力的见解已日益引起人们的注意，因为在广大人民看来，这种见解是完全正确的。在战后最初几年中，全世界人民曾对联合国寄予很大的希望，但是当大国一致的原则被抛弃，并开始由单纯的多数来解决问题的时候，无疑地，联合国宪章已经受到侵犯。结果，小国的票数被用贿赂和威胁的手段骗取过去了。而承认大国一致的原则是它们独立和自由的唯一保障的正是这些小国。我们关于五大国进行谈判缔结和平公约的要求，就是意味着真正恢复作为人民信赖联合国的那种基础。
    约里奥—居里接着说：我们对将于本年底在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议寄予很大的希望。有广泛代表性的一个委员会正在筹备开会事宜。我们希望在我们组织系统以外的各阶层代表人物也参加这个会议。这个会议将建基于社会主义和资本主义可以和平共存的原则上面。我们亟愿证明和平经济能够给生活的各方面带来多么大的好处。
