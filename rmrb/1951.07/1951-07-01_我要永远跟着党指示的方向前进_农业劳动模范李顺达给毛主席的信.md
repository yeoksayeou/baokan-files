I Will Forever Follow the Direction Indicated by the Party
    --A Letter to Chairman Mao from Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda

Respected Chairman Mao:

    This year's "July 1st" marks the 30th anniversary of the Party. The 30 years of struggle of the Party are the greatest encouragement to me and all the Party members in Xigou Village. In order to express my respect and love for you and the Party Central Committee, in addition to making the greatest effort to complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party and using more production increases to strengthen the power of national construction, I would also like to report to you on the changes in my ideological understanding over the past two or three years, and ask you to give me more instructions and education so that I can continue to advance under the leadership of the Party.

    First, let me talk about my understanding of the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural relations. Four years ago, my understanding of this fundamental issue was very vague. I felt that: "Workers and peasants are about the same, and cities are not necessarily better than villages." But since I visited the industrial exhibition in Tianjin in 1949, and participated in the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers and the Provincial Congress of Labor Models of Industry and Agriculture in 1950, listened to the reports of the worker brothers, and personally used the single-blade plow, weeder, sprayer, etc. manufactured by the worker brothers to support agricultural production, the facts corrected my wrong understanding, and my horizons began to broaden. At this time, I truly recognized the leading role of the worker brothers in production and politics, understood the importance of cities, and the reason why the country should be industrialized. At the same time, I also deeply realized that the task of rural Party members is to organize peasants to produce more grain and more industrial raw materials to support cities and industry; only in this way can agricultural production be improved and our lives further improved, which is beneficial to the country, to the worker brothers, and to the peasants themselves. My own particularly high enthusiasm for production in the past year or two is closely related to understanding this principle. Therefore, when I became a propagandist this year, I paid special attention to publicizing this principle within the Party and among the masses. I think every Communist Party member in the countryside should understand this principle.

    Secondly, let me talk about my understanding of the relationship between production and politics, and between the individual and the country. After the land reform and several years of large-scale production campaigns, the lives of my own family and the masses in the whole village have been greatly improved. At this time, I heard a lot of feedback. Niu Yongqing, a member of our mutual aid team, said: "Household affairs have become too much, and we are too busy with production to take care of learning." My family also had this kind of feedback, but it did not attract my attention. Since the American imperialists invaded Korea last year and after this year's War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, I was awakened. I felt that these words reflected the selfishness of the peasants, and I began to realize the danger of burying oneself in production without caring about politics. Especially after I studied the radio speech by Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, "We must closely combine economic construction tasks with political struggle tasks," I clarified this issue ideologically. I knew that domestic and foreign reactionaries were always trying to destroy our good times. Without the people's country, there would be no wealthy life we have today. Therefore, in the patriotic pact that we established in the whole village this year, the first article was: "Care about politics, love the motherland." The production enthusiasm and political atmosphere of the Party members and the masses in the whole village were revitalized. Everyone accused the enemy of their crimes, compared the present and past lives, and criticized the wrong idea of not caring about politics. Everyone said: "Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea is the best political education."

    In our struggle against the enemy, land reform and production movement, the Party and the People's Government have always been enthusiastic leaders and actively supported us. Since our mutual aid team launched the challenge to the national patriotic production increase competition to our brother peasants in the spring of this year, the People's Government has given us a lot of help in technology and materials. Labor models and mutual aid teams from all over the country have written many challenge letters, which is a great encouragement to us. Developing production relies on the collective strength of the country and the people. I myself have realized the loveliness of the motherland and the people of the motherland. The people's country is indeed a big family. It is the most glorious and happy thing to grow up in such a country. However, without your correct leadership, without the self-sacrifice and heroic struggle of the Party and the people of the whole country for thirty years, how could we have today?

    As the 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching, I happily and carefully recalled the thirteen years of history after joining the Party, and I was very moved. The reason why I have been able to make continuous progress and be awarded the title of model in production and various struggles is because I have been able to receive your education and the Party's training. I fully understand that nothing can be accomplished without the Party. My glory is given to me by the Party and the people, and it also belongs to the Party and the people. I should not have any pride or complacency. Thinking of this, I want to swear to you - respected Chairman Mao: I am a Communist Party member, I will forever follow the direction indicated by you and the Party; and move forward! I wish you good health!
                                                                                                                                                                                                           Shanxi Province Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda

### 我要永远跟着党指示的方向前进——农业劳动模范李顺达给毛主席的信

　　我要永远跟着党指示的方向前进
    ——农业劳动模范李顺达给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    今年的“七一”是党的三十周年纪念日。党的三十年奋斗历史，对我和全西沟村的党员都是最大的鼓舞。为了表示我对您和党中央的敬爱，除了我将以最大的努力，完成党给予我的任务，用更多的增产行动，加强祖国建设的力量外，更愿把我近二三年来思想认识上的变化向您作一次报告，请求你给我以更多的指示和教育，使我在党的领导下前进不息。
    首先谈一下我对工农联盟和城乡关系的认识。四年以前我对这个原则问题了解的很模糊。我觉得：“工人和农民差不多，城市不一定比乡村好。”可是自从一九四九年我到天津参观了工业展览会，一九五零年又参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议和全省工农业劳动模范大会，听了工人老大哥们的报告，又亲自使用了工人老大哥为了支援农业生产所制造的单把犁、耘锄、喷雾器等，事实纠正了我的错误认识，我的眼界开始放宽了。我这时才真正认识了工人老大哥在生产上和政治上的领导作用，懂得了城市的重要，以及为什么国家要工业化的道理。同时，我也深刻地认识到农村党员的任务是要组织农民多打粮食，多生产工业原料，支援城市，支援工业；只有这样才能提高农业生产，更进一步改善我们的生活，对国家、对工人老大哥、对农民自己都有好处。我自己近一二年生产情绪特别高涨是和懂得了这个道理有很大关系的。因此，当我今年担任了宣传员的时候，我就在党内和群众中特别注意宣传这个道理，我想每个农村中的共产党员是应当懂得这个道理的。
    其次，再谈一下我对生产和政治、个人和国家关系的认识。经过土地改革和几年的大生产运动，我自己的家庭和全村群众的生活是大大地提高了。这时我就听到好多反映，我们互助组组员牛永清说：“家务闹大了，生产的事还忙不过来，学习实在顾不上。”我家里的人也有这种反映，但并未引起我的注意。自去年美帝国主义侵略朝鲜及经过今年的抗美援朝运动，把我惊醒了，我觉得这些话反映了农民的自私思想，我开始认识了埋头生产不关心政治的危险性。特别是当我学习了省委书记赖若愚同志“必须把经济建设任务和政治斗争任务密切结合起来”的广播演说后，使我在思想上弄清楚了这个问题。我知道了国内外反动派时时刻刻想破坏我们的好时光，没有人民的国家，就不会有我们今天富裕的生活，所以我们在今年全村订立的爱国公约上，头一条就写上：“关心政治，热爱祖国。”全村党员和群众的生产热情和政治空气为之一振，大家控诉敌人的罪恶，把现在和过去的生活拿来对比，批判不关心政治的错误思想。大家都说：“抗美援朝是最好的一课政治教育。”
    在我们进行对敌斗争、土地改革及生产运动中，党和人民政府从来是热情的领导，积极的支援。自从今年春天我们的互助组向全国农民兄弟提出爱国丰产竞赛运动的挑战后，人民政府在技术上、物质上又给了我们很多帮助。全国各地的劳动模范和互助组写来很多应战信，对我们是一个很大的鼓励。发展生产是靠国家和人民集体力量来进行的，我自己更体会到祖国和祖国人民的可爱，人民的国家确实是一个大家庭，生长在这样的一个国家里是再光荣和幸福不过了。可是，如果没有您的正确领导，没有党和全国人民三十年的自我牺牲和英勇斗争，那能有今天呢？
    当着党的三十周年纪念到来的时候，我高兴地仔细回想了入党后的十三年历史，心里很感动。我所以能够不断地进步，并且能在生产和各项斗争中获得模范的称号，都是因为能得到您的教育和党的培养。我完全懂得了：离开党不论做什么将一事无成。我的光荣是党和人民给我的，而且亦是属于党和人民的，我不应有丝毫骄傲和自满。想到这里，我要向您——敬爱的毛主席宣誓：我是一个共产党员，我要永远跟着您和党所指示的方向前进；再前进！祝您健康！
                                山西省农业劳动模范  李顺达
