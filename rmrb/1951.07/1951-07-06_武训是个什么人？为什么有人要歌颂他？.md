　　What Kind of Person Was Wu Xun? Why Do Some People Praise Him?
    Fan Wenlan
    In the past, I had not paid attention to Wu Xun. Recently, I have read many articles about Wu Xun in the newspapers and also watched the movie "The Story of Wu Xun," the "Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun," and "The Eternal Beggar." I have a responsibility to participate in this discussion, and I should offer my opinions.
        (I) What Kind of Person Was Wu Xun?
    Regarding Wu Xun's actions, I mainly rely on Mr. Xie Xingyao's "Wu Xun: The Person and His Deeds," and also refer to some materials from the "Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun" and other books.
            (1) Wu Xun's Class Background
    Wu Xun came from a poor peasant family. From the age of fifteen to nineteen, he worked as a hired laborer, enduring the abuse of his employers. He was cheated out of three years' wages by Li Laobian with a false account book and was beaten and driven out. His painful experience is understandable.
    Wu Xun was driven out and "slept" in a dilapidated temple for three days. This was the time when Wu Xun was choosing which path he should take. According to the rebellious nature of the peasant class, especially the poor and hired peasants, he could have joined the peasant uprisings that were happening locally at the time, but Wu Xun did not want to. According to the conservative nature of the peasant class, he could have returned home to help his brother Wu Qian farm the land, but Wu Xun did not want to either. The path he chose was to be a beggar.
    From this, we can see that although Wu Xun came from a poor hired peasant background, he had been a beggar in his childhood, acquired the habits of a loafer, and retained elements of vagrant thought in his mind. This factor eventually developed, determining that he would abandon the peasant class and join the rural vagrant class. "Working hard and being bullied is not as good as begging and being free" became his fundamental idea.
    The vagrant class is an extremely scattered, extremely selfish, and self-interested, impatient with formal productive labor, living off handouts and easy money. Its ideological characteristics are, on the one hand, destructiveness, and on the other hand, servility. People belonging to this class are easily bought off and will try to join reactionary forces as lackeys, taking advantage of the situation to oppress and exploit the weak in order to achieve unearned gain and satisfy selfish desires. Wu Xun was such a person. He would act like a dog, horse, or mule for those who gave him money—even a single coin or two—allowing himself to be punched, kicked, and beaten. He revered influential gentlemen like Lou Junling and Yang Shufang as if they were gods, feeling as inferior as an insect, and considering it an honor to be the gentlemen's dog, horse, or mule. His ingratiating smiles and kowtows showed an extraordinary servility. His cold-heartedness towards his brother and mother (or aunt, according to one account) and his cruel behavior in relentlessly exploiting the poor through high-interest loans using the power of the gentry, showed his cruelty and destructiveness.
    Some people say that Wu Xun begged for the sake of "accumulating money to establish schools." This statement is incorrect. Let's try to calculate Wu Xun's accounts. Wu Xun begged from the age of twenty to thirty, accumulating ninety strings of cash, an average of nine strings of cash per year. According to the "Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun," "ginning a catty (斤 should be 天, a typo) of cotton fluff can earn two hundred cash, spinning a catty of cotton can earn six hundred cash, and watering gardens for people can earn two hundred cash a day." From this, it can be inferred that the labor reward at that time was about two hundred cash a day. Wu Xun had three mu of land under his name. If he engaged in sideline labor for one hundred days a year in addition to farming, he could earn twenty strings a year, which would be two hundred strings in ten years, more than twice what he earned from begging. This shows that Wu Xun's begging was not out of necessity, nor was it that establishing schools required begging. Rather, it was out of a dislike for labor and a love for the "free" life of a vagrant. From the nine strings of cash accumulated per year, it can be seen that he did not beg for much money. He also did very little work such as grinding flour and watering gardens for people. He didn't earn much money by performing embarrassing tricks on the street such as "lifting heavy tripods," "scorpion crawling," "cartwheeling," "eating snakes and scorpions," and "pretending to be a horse for children to ride." Since begging was neither a good way to accumulate money nor the only good way, why did Wu Xun have to beg? Apart from the fact that loafers found begging quite interesting, there is probably no other reason to explain it. Some people say that Wu Xun's life was very "austere," "drinking dirty water," "eating pig feed," and even "eating mule dung." Did he also think this was quite interesting? Yes, if Wu Xun regularly drank dirty water and ate pig feed and mule dung, it would naturally have to be admitted that his life was austere. However, Wu Xun regularly ate the food he begged for, which is the food that ordinary people ate. He didn't engage in productive labor, but he was able to eat the food of ordinary people. What was so austere about his life? "Drinking dirty water" and "eating pig feed and mule dung" were obviously shocking tricks performed in public, the same as some evil beggars cutting their heads with razors or hitting their chests with bricks. Wu Xun was not more "austere" than some evil beggars.
    At the age of thirty, Wu Xun divided the family property with his brother and obtained three mu of land, which he sold for one hundred and twenty strings of cash. Together with the ninety strings of cash he had accumulated from begging, he had a total of two hundred and ten strings. He knelt down and begged Lou Junling and Yang Shufang to lend the money to the poor at high interest. From the age of thirty to fifty, Wu Xun accumulated more than two hundred and thirty mu of land and more than two thousand eight hundred strings of cash, becoming a landlord and usurer. After the age of fifty, he rose to become a large landlord and senior gentleman, associating with the government officials. His begging rose to become officially commissioned fundraising. Finally, even the Manchu Qing court associated with him, awarding him a memorial archway, further elevating his status. However, Wu Xun always maintained the formal identity of a beggar until his death and never married. This has misled many people into admiring him. In fact, there were many benefits to being a beggar for him. First, it is extremely difficult for a beggar to gain the appreciation of gentlemen. Wu Xun used "begging to establish schools" as a stepping stone and a deed of sale. After ten years, he was actually taken in by the Jinshi Yang as a slave. "Begging" was Wu Xun's only capital to "get ahead," so of course he couldn't give it up. Second, a beggar who wants to lend money at high interest has no guarantee. Wu Xun had to rely on the power of the gentry to force the poor to repay their debts. Using the name of "begging" to cover up the reality of "accumulating money" (exploitation) was his trick, so of course he couldn't give it up. Third, the gentlemen saw Wu Xun as a particularly loyal slave, a useful lackey, because he had the effect of paralyzing resistance and eliminating peasant uprisings. If Wu Xun had not been a beggar, had married and had children, and established a family, he would inevitably have been considered by the gentlemen as having lost his usefulness or having become a rebellious usurper. He would have been demoted from the position of a special slave to an ordinary slave, or he would have been punished and expelled. Wu Xun's future would have been over from then on. Begging was of great benefit to Wu Xun, so of course he couldn't give it up. Fourth, Wu Xun had a strong tendency to be a loafer and a deep rogue character. Being a beggar and living a "free" wandering life suited his heart's desires. If he didn't beg, it would be inconvenient for him to play around and beg for money by "lifting heavy tripods" and "cartwheeling" on the street, so he also couldn't give it up. Wu Xun's lifelong maintenance of the name of a beggar was inevitable. He started by "begging to establish schools," so it was inevitable that he would shout "establishing schools" all his life. Wu Xun was a vagrant, but he was also a landlord, gentleman, and usurer. Wu Xun was a person who did not like to study, but he was also a "great educator." In the final analysis, Wu Xun was an extremely cunning big rogue.
            (2) For Whom Did Wu Xun Establish Schools?
    Wu Xun's "begging to establish schools" was just a means to join the ranks of the gentry. He didn't consider what kind of school to establish or for whom to establish it. Some people say that Wu Xun didn't establish free schools for poor children? Yes, how could a begging loafer dare to say that he wanted to run schools for rich children? Of course, he could only say that it was for poor children.
    Wu Xun repeatedly said that he wanted poor children to read and write, but he himself was the one who disliked reading and writing the most. After the age of thirty, he had already joined the ranks of the gentry. If he really loved reading and writing, he could have kowtowed and begged (this was his usual trick) the Jinshi Yang, and told the village schoolmaster to teach Wu Xun a word or a phrase like "heaven and earth black and yellow," or "Zhao Qian Sun Li" for a day or two. He could then kowtow and beg in front of the schoolmaster, asking the schoolmaster to treat it as giving a bowl of rice or a penny to a beggar. Jinshi Yang and the schoolmaster might have allowed it. However, it has never been heard that Wu Xun made such a request, but he was busy showing off and begging for money on the street or using his mind to exploit the money of the poor. He never wanted to learn a word in his life, which shows that he didn't really think it was necessary to learn to read and write. So, wanting poor children to read and write, isn't that a deceptive trick? Some people say that this is the spirit of "self-sacrifice." May I ask, does spending some time learning to read for a day or two count as not "sacrificing oneself" and not "serving others"? Does he not stop begging on the street for even a minute? He exploited the money of the poor, claiming that he wanted to run schools for the children of poor families. But in reality, as Mr. Xie Xingyao said about the students of the so-called "Chongxian Free School," "judging from the teachers' status, the content of the teaching, and the number of students, one can imagine that the students' composition would not be children from poor peasant families." Some people say that Wu Xun's motive for running schools for poor children was good. Who has drilled into Wu Xun's brain and seen his real motive? Saying that his motive was good is based on Wu Xun's nice-sounding words. Why not use Wu Xun's actual behavior as a basis? The first "Chongxian Free School" was not accessible to poor children, but he continued to run two so-called "free schools" without making any improvements because poor children could not attend. This shows that Wu Xun's motive was only to run schools for the sake of begging and joining the ranks of the gentry, not to run schools for poor children.
            (3) Wu Xun is a Feudal Corpse
    Wu Xun, the most cunning big rogue and extremely reactionary slave, hung up the banner of "begging to establish schools" in an attempt to undermine the then vigorously developing peasant uprisings. In the eyes of the reactionary ruling class, Wu Xun was indeed a useful tool worthy of great praise. From the Manchu Qing gentry, bureaucrats, and emperors to the Northern Warlords and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they all praised him "high into the clouds" because his utter servility and reactionary nature were very much to the liking of the reactionary rulers. The reactionary rulers hoped that the Chinese people would learn the "Wu Xun spirit," so that the world would be "peaceful" and they could sleep soundly. The "Wu Xun spirit" was also very much to the liking of the imperialists. The New Testament taught slaves to "do not resist an evil person (?); if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." Wu Xun regarded all powerful people as good people and practiced the teachings of the New Testament one hundred percent. Therefore, Wu Xun was the most popular figure in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and it was by no means accidental that he was sent to sit side by side with the feudal sage Confucius in the temple.
    However, in the new democratic society, Wu Xun immediately became a stinking feudal corpse, no longer allowed to remain in people's minds, and even less allowed to jump around and make trouble in front of the people. He should be thoroughly eliminated along with imperialism and feudalism.
            (II) Why Do Some People Praise Him?
    Before the People's Daily published its editorial, many people praised Wu Xun; after the editorial was published, some people still defended Wu Xun, that is to say, they were still praising Wu Xun. These people who praised Wu Xun in the past or now can be roughly divided into the following categories (reactionaries who praised Wu Xun are another matter):
    (1) Following the crowd -- These people have not studied Wu Xun. They only say good things because others say good things. Once they recognize Wu Xun's true face, they will immediately spit on him without hesitation.
    (2) Fundraising for schools -- Among these people, some are reformists in the education sector who believe that "education" can "save the country." During the reactionary ruling period, fundraising for schools was very difficult. Before asking for money, they inevitably humbled themselves and said many nice things to the pot-bellied ones. Therefore, they compared their fundraising to Wu Xun's "begging" and their "saving the country" to Wu Xun's "establishing schools." Praising Wu Xun was praising themselves, or at least comforting and encouraging themselves. There are also some progressive educators who are misled by Wu Xun's trick of "running free schools for poor children." They praised Wu Xun even more to compare themselves to their own progressive education. These people probably only knew a general idea of Wu Xun's true situation and did not study it in depth. Therefore, when they learned the new democratic education policy and recognized that Wu Xun was a big slave, they would abandon Wu Xun without any hesitation.
    (3) Sympathizing with "altruism" -- These people believe that no matter how vile and shameful Wu Xun's behavior was, his "suffering and enduring humiliation" and "self-sacrifice" "altruism" are still worthy of admiration. If these people only admire "altruism" in the abstract and do not have any other prejudices, then as long as they understand the principle that the "others" that Wu Xun benefited are not the "others" of the poor children, but the "others" of the landlords and rich peasants. Benefiting the "others" of the landlords and rich peasants also benefited Wu Xun's own "self." I think that if these people find that Wu Xun is not altruistic (to poor children) but selfish, they will be willing to abandon Wu Xun and not bother to defend him any more.
    (4) Feudal thinking -- These people have feudal ideas in their minds, even strong feudal ideas. Although they also say that they want to "eliminate feudal remnants and cooperate with land reform" on the surface, they actually see Wu Xun's ugly behavior of opposing peasant uprisings and completely surrendering to the landlords as very much to their liking, and think it is worth introducing to the working people, to take Wu Xun's path of slavery. Any feudal reactionary figure cannot show their face in the new democratic society. As soon as they show their face, they will be booed off the stage by the masses. Wu Xun has been praised by progressives, given more beautiful clothes, and used to promote feudalism. It is indeed the most suitable material. If those who wholeheartedly and sincerely praise Wu Xun recognize the weight of their feudal ideas and the role their behavior objectively plays, not "eliminating feudal remnants and cooperating with land reform" but promoting feudal restoration and opposing the peasants' liberation, then they should be responsible to the people, quickly adopt a serious attitude to accept criticism and conduct self-criticism, and openly admit their mistakes. If they can do this, I think their sins can still be redeemed.
    (5) Stubborn thinking -- These people have rigid minds, and Wu Xun's corpse just happens to be a place for them to hide. Even now, some people are digging up various broken "reasons" to defend Wu Xun, and also themselves, saying that Wu Xun at least has some slight merits and should not be completely written off. These people are, on the one hand, deeply poisoned by feudal thinking, and on the other hand, completely ignorant of common sense in social science. If they must claim to have "knowledge," then they only know some incoherent and delirious dreams such as "live for the proletariat, be friends with the proletariat in life; die for the proletariat, and be buried with the proletariat in death." These people must be given severe criticism to help them learn and transform. I think that even if they are stubborn and unyielding, they will eventually feel that it is dangerous to harbor a corpse in their minds, and this corpse will not give them any benefit.
    Wu Xun, from the top of his head to the soles of his feet, from his skin to his blood vessels, is soaked with the poison of feudalism. Today, when land reform is underway, many people are actually praising him. The movie "The Story of Wu Xun," the "Pictorial Biography of Wu Xun," "The Eternal Beggar," and individual articles have all appeared together. This shows that there are still weaknesses on our revolutionary ideological front, giving Wu Xun's followers an opportunity to take advantage of. We must be vigilant, strive to learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the ideological front, and prevent the poisonous arrows of feudalism from shooting over again.

### 武训是个什么人？为什么有人要歌颂他？

　　武训是个什么人？为什么有人要歌颂他？
    范文澜
    过去，我没有注意过武训这个人，最近从报纸上读了许多有关武训的文章，并把《武训传》影片，《武训画传》，《千古奇丐》也看了。我有责任参加这个讨论，我应该提出自己的意见。
        （一）武训是个怎样的人？
    关于武训的行事，我主要根据谢兴尧先生的《武训其人其事》，同时也参考了些《武训画传》等书所说材料。
            （１）武训的阶级成份
    武训出身贫农家庭，十五岁到十九岁当雇工，受尽雇主的虐待。他被李老辫用假账本赖去三年工钱，还挨一顿毒打，驱逐出门。他这种痛苦遭遇是可以同情的。
    武训被逐出门，在破庙里“昏睡”了三天，这正是武训在选择他自己该走那一条道路的时候。按照农民阶级，特别是贫雇农的反抗性，他可以参加当时当地的农民起义军，但武训不愿意。按照农民阶级的保守性，他可以回家帮哥哥武谦种地，但武训也不愿意。他选择的道路是做乞丐。
    从这里可以看出武训虽然出身贫雇农，但幼年曾做过乞丐，沾染了二流子习气，思想里保有游民思想的因素，而这个因素，终于发展起来，决定他放弃农民阶级，加入农村游民阶层，“扛活受人欺，不如讨饭随自己”，就成为他的根本思想。
    游民阶层是极端散漫，极端自私自利，不耐烦正式进行生产劳动，吃空手饭，吃浮头食的游离阶层。其思想特征，一方面是破坏性，一方面是奴隶性。属于这个阶层的人，容易被收买也会想法投靠到反动势力门下作走狗，借势欺压、剥削弱者，以达到不劳而获，满足自私的目的。武训就是这样的一个人，他对给钱——那怕一个钱两个钱——的人，装狗装马装驴骡，拳打脚踢都可以，对有势力的绅士娄峻岭、杨树芳之流，奉之若神明，自卑如虫豸，做绅士家的狗马驴骡觉得很荣幸。他那胁肩谄笑，下跪磕头的丑态，表现了异乎寻常的奴隶性。他对哥哥与母亲（一说伯母）的那种冷酷无情和借绅士势力重利盘剥穷人，一丝一毫不放松的凶狠行为，又表现了他的残忍性，破坏性。
    有人说，武训讨饭为的是“积钱兴学”，这种说法是错误的。我们试替武训算一算账。武训二十岁讨饭到三十岁积得钱九十吊，平均一年积钱九吊。照《武训画传》所说，“轧一斤（斤当是天字之误）棉花绒子可以赚二百文制钱，纺一斤棉花能得到六百文制钱，替人家浇园，一天可以赚到二百文制钱”，可以推想当时劳动报酬，一天约为二百文制钱。武训名下有三亩地，如果种地以外，每年进行副业劳动一百天，一年即可得二十吊，十年当有二百吊，比讨饭所得多一倍以上，足见武训讨饭并非出于不得已，也不是兴学非讨饭不可，而是出于不爱劳动，爱过“随自己”的游民生活。从一年积钱九吊看来，他讨得的钱是不多的，给人家磨面浇园等工作，也是做得很少的，在街上玩“拿大鼎”，“蝎子爬”，“打车轮”，“吃蛇蝎”，“学马爬让孩子们骑”等等丑把戏，也没有获得多少钱。讨饭既不是积钱的好方法，更不是唯一的好方法，那末武训为什么一定要讨饭呢？除了二流子把讨饭这件事看作颇有兴趣以外，怕不能有其他理由可作解释。有人说：武训生活很“刻苦”，“喝脏水”“吃猪食”甚至“吃骡粪”，难道他也以为颇有兴趣么？是的，如果武训喝的经常是脏水，吃的经常是猪食骡粪，说他生活刻苦，自然该承认。不过武训经常吃讨来的饭，也就是经常吃普通人所吃的饭，不劳动生产，而吃到普通人的饭，生活刻什么苦呢？“喝脏水”“吃猪食、骡粪”，显然是当众表现一番的吓人把戏，与某些恶丐用剃刀破头，用砖块打胸同一行径，武训并不比某些恶丐更“刻苦”些。
    武训三十岁和哥哥分家得地三亩，变卖得钱一百二十吊，合讨饭所积九十吊，两共二百一十吊，跪求娄峻岭，杨树芳替他向穷人放债生息。从三十岁到五十岁，武训积得土地二百三十多亩，现钱二千八百多吊，成为地主兼高利贷者。五十岁以后，又上升为大地主，高级绅士，与官府交接，乞讨上升为奉令募捐。最后，连满清朝廷也和他交接，赏他立牌坊，地位更高了。但是武训一直到死，形式上总保持着乞丐的身份，终身不娶妻。这一点，把很多人迷惑得钦佩之至。事实上，他做乞丐有很多好处。第一，一个乞丐想得到绅士的赏识是极为困难的，武训用“行乞兴学”作敲门砖，卖身契，十年工夫居然被杨进士收下当奴才。“行乞”是武训“发迹”的唯一本钱，当然舍弃不得。第二，一个乞丐想放高利贷，是毫无保障的，武训必须依靠绅士势力，才能逼穷人还账。用“行乞”之名，掩盖“积钱”（剥削）之实，这正是他的妙处所在，当然舍弃不得。第三，绅士看武训是个特别忠实的奴才，可用的走狗，因为他有麻痹反抗情绪，取消农民起义的作用。如果武训不做乞丐，娶妻生子，成家立业了，势必被绅士认为失去作用或变节僭越，不是从特别奴才的地位降为普通奴才，便是予以惩罚而斥逐，武训的前途从此完了。行乞对武训有大利，当然舍弃不得。第四，武训有极浓的二流子习气，有极深的无赖性格，做乞丐过着“随自己”的游荡生活，适合于心之所好，不做乞丐就不便在街上“拿大鼎”“打车轮”闹着玩哄钱，因此也有些舍弃不得。武训一辈子保持乞丐名义是势所必然的，他以“行乞兴学”起家，所以一辈子嚷着“兴学”，也是势所必然的，武训是个游民，但又是地主绅士高利贷者，武训是个不爱读书的人，但又是“大教育家”，归根说来，武训是个极其狡诈的大流氓。
            （２）武训为谁兴学？
    武训“行乞兴学”不过是投靠绅士门下的一种手段，兴什么学，为谁兴学，他并不考虑。有人说，武训不是为穷孩子兴义学么？是的，他一个讨饭的二流子，怎敢说要给富孩子办学呢，当然只好说为了穷孩子。
    武训口口声声说要让穷孩子读书认字，他本人却是最不喜欢读书认字。他三十岁以后，已经投靠了绅士，如果真是爱认字的话，磕头跪求（这是他的惯技）杨进士，吩咐村里塾师一声，一天或两天教武训一个字或一句“天地玄黄”，“赵钱孙李”。自己再到塾师门前磕头跪求一番，请塾师当作赏给乞丐一碗饭，一文钱，杨进士和塾师是可能允许的。但是不曾听说武训有过这样的要求，却忙于在街上献丑哄钱或用心计盘剥穷人的钱财。他自己一辈子不肯认个字，足见他并不真以为认字有必要，那末，要穷孩子读书认字，不是骗人的把戏是什么？有人说，这是“舍己为人”的精神。试问一天或两天费一些时间认字，就算不“舍己”不“为人”了么？难道他一分钟也不停止的在街上讨饭么？他剥削穷人的钱，口称要替穷人家孩子办学，实际呢，所谓“崇贤义塾”的学生，正如谢兴尧先生所说“由教师的地位，教学的内容，学生的人数看，都可以想像学生的成份不会是贫苦的农民子弟”。有人说，武训为穷孩子办学的动机是好的。谁钻进武训的头脑里，见过他的真正动机呢？说他动机好，还不是根据武训那些口头好听话？为什么不用武训的实际行为作根据呢？第一个“崇贤义塾”，穷孩子进不了学，但是他仍继续办两个所谓“义塾”，并不因为穷孩子进不了学而有所改善，足见武训的动机只是为行乞、为投靠绅士而办学，不是为穷孩子办学。
            （３）武训是个封建僵尸
    武训这个最狡诈的大流氓，极反动的大奴才，他挂着“行乞兴学”的招牌，企图破坏当时蓬勃发展的农民起义，在反动统治阶级看来，武训确是值得大大表扬的有用工具。从满清的绅士、官僚、皇帝到北洋军阀、蒋介石匪帮，一致把他捧得“高入云表”，就是因为他的十足奴隶性和反动性，极合反动统治者的口味。反动统治者希望中国人民学习“武训精神”，那就天下“太平”，可以高枕无忧了。“武训精神”又极合帝国主义者的口味，新约全书教训奴隶们说“不要与恶人（？）作对，有人打你的右脸，连左脸也转过来由他打”，武训对有势力的人都看作善人，百分之百的实行了新约的教训。所以武训这个人正是半封建半殖民地社会里最行时的上上人物，被送到封建圣人孔子堂上并肩而坐，丝毫不是偶然的。
    但是到了新民主主义社会里，武训立即成为臭秽的封建僵尸，再不允许它停留在人们的头脑里，更不允许它在人民面前跳梁胡闹。它应与帝国主义、封建主义一起被彻底的消灭。
            （二）为什么有人要歌颂他？
    在人民日报发表社论以前，不少人在歌颂武训；社论发表以后，还有些人为武训辩护，也就是说依然还在歌颂武训。这些过去或现在歌颂武训的人，大致有下列几类（歌颂武训的反革命分子，又当别论）：
    （１）人云亦云——这一类人并未研究过武训，仅因别人说好，跟着也说好。一朝认识了武训的真面目，就会立即唾弃，毫不犹豫。
    （２）募款办学——这一类人中，有些是教育界改良主义人士，自以为“教育”可以“救国”，在反动统治时期，募款办学，困难很多，当伸手要钱以前，不免低声下气向大腹便便者说许多好话，因此借武训“行乞”来比自己的募款，借武训“兴学”来比自己的“救国”，捧武训就是捧自己，至少是给自己解嘲打气。还有一些进步教育家，被武训为“穷孩子办义学”的把戏所迷惑，更要高捧武训用来比自己在办进步教育。这一个人对武训的真实情况，大概也只是略知一般，并未深入研究，所以当他们学习了新民主主义的教育政策和认识了武训是个大奴才时，他们也会抛弃武训，无所留恋。
    （３）同情“利他主义”——这一类人以为不管武训的行为如何卑污可耻，但他那种“受苦忍辱”，“舍己为人”的“利他主义”还是值得钦佩。这一类人如果只是抽象地钦佩“利他主义”而不是有什么其他成见的话，那么，只要懂得这样的一个道理，就是武训所利的“他”，不是穷孩子的“他”，而是地主富农的“他”。利了地主富农的“他”，反过来也就利了武训自己的“己”。我想，这一类人如果发现武训并不是利他（穷孩子）主义而是利己主义时，很愿意抛弃武训，犯不着替他再作什么辩护。
    （４）封建思想——这一类人头脑里有封建思想，甚至有浓厚的封建思想。他们口头上虽然也说要“铲除封建残余，配合土地改革，”实际上把武训那种反对农民起义，彻底投降地主的丑恶行为看得很合心意，认为值得介绍给劳动人民，走武训的奴才道路。任何一个封建反动人物，在新民主主义社会里，无法露出他们的头面，一露脸就要被群众哄下去。武训曾被进步人士歌颂过，给他披上更多的好看外衣，利用他来宣扬封建主义，确是最合式不过的一块材料。大吹大擂真心诚意歌颂武训的人如果认识到自己封建思想的沉重，自己的行为客观上所起的作用，不是“铲除封建残余，配合土地改革”，而是宣扬封建复辟，反对农民翻身，那就应该对人民负责，赶快采取严肃态度接受批评并进行自我批评，公开承认错误。能这样做，我想他们的罪过还是可以补救的。
    （５）思想顽固——这一类人头脑僵化，武训那个僵尸正好把它当作藏身之所。直到现在为止，还有些人为了给武训也是为自己辩护，挖出各种破碎“道理”来，说武训至少尚有些微可取之处，不该一笔抹杀。这一类人一方面是中封建思想之毒太深，一方面是对社会科学的常识完全无知。如果一定要自称有“知”的话，那也只是知些“为无产阶级而生，生与无产阶级为友；为无产阶级而死，死后与无产阶级同穴”等等语无伦次的昏迷梦话。对待这一类人，必须予以严厉的批评，帮助他们学习和改造。我想，他们即使顽固不化，总有一天会感到头脑里窝藏着一个僵尸是危险的，这个僵尸不会给他们丝毫的好处。
    武训这个人，从头顶到脚底，从皮肤到血管，浸透了封建主义的毒素，当土地改革正在进行的今天，居然有不少的人歌颂他，什么《武训传》电影、《武训画传》、《千古奇丐》、单篇文章一齐出现了，这说明我们革命的思想战线上还存在着弱点，使武训的徒众们有机可乘。我们必须警惕，努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，加强思想战线，防止封建主义的毒箭再一次射过来。
