  The Happy Road of the Mongolian People
    The first Mongolian national opera, "The Happy Road," was performed by the Ulan Bator National Music and Drama Theatre on July 12. This opera praises the Mongolian people's love and loyalty to their free and happy motherland, and their heroic labor for the prosperity of the republic; it also praises the heroic Mongolian soldiers who fought side by side with the heroic Soviet army and the Chinese People's Army to defeat Japanese imperialism; at the same time, it expresses the great friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples.
    The happy road of the Mongolian people is the road that all nations still oppressed by imperialism should strive for.

  Lament of Indian Writers
    A delegation of Indian writers, led by the famous playwright and poet Katobadaya, is visiting various parts of the Soviet Union. Katobadaya told a TASS reporter his impressions of Soviet life: The Soviet state, like a mother, cares for the happiness of all the people of the Soviet Union.

  American Bandits Cover Up Atrocities with More Atrocities
    American invading troops massacred many innocent residents in Masan-ri Village, Pyongan-namdo Province, Korea. After the American bandits were driven out of the village, the American command sent several bombers to bomb the ravine where they had committed the murders, in an attempt to cover up the traces of their atrocities.

  蒙古人民的幸福之路
    第一部蒙古民族歌剧《幸福之路》，已于七月十二日由乌兰巴托国家音乐戏剧院演出。这部歌剧表扬了蒙古人民对自由与快乐的祖国的热爱和忠诚，和为共和国的繁荣昌盛而从事的英勇劳动；它也表扬了英勇的蒙古将士，他们曾与英勇的苏军及中国人民军队并肩作战打败了日本帝国主义；它同时表现了苏联和蒙古两国人民间的伟大友谊。
    蒙古人民的幸福之路，是一切现在仍被帝国主义压迫的民族所应该争取的道路。

  美国强盗以暴行掩盖暴行
    美国侵略军在朝鲜平安南道马山里村屠杀了许多的无辜居民。当美国强盗被赶出这个村后，美国司令部派了几架轰炸机去轰炸他们曾经在那里杀人的山沟，企图掩盖他们暴行的痕迹。
    美国强盗竟图以暴行来掩盖暴行，难道轰炸和平村庄就不算是暴行了吗？
