　　Editor's Note: To educate cadres with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improve their theoretical level, and further improve our work is one of the main tasks of the Party. Party organizations in various localities should allocate a certain number of capable cadres to be specifically responsible for this work, provide certain material guarantees, and the leading departments should strengthen the daily leadership of this work. This is a prerequisite for doing a good job in cadre education.

　　Educating cadres with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is a fundamental method for cadres to improve their work and is one of the main tasks of the Party. Theoretical study for on-the-job cadres requires regular and specific guidance, which requires a group of Party theory instructors to undertake this work. Therefore, training and cultivating theory instructors is the central link in carrying out cadre study. The Marxist-Leninist Night School was established to cultivate theory instructors for cadres of various agencies stationed in Wuhan. The success or failure of the night school has an extremely significant impact on the development of cadre study in various agencies stationed in Wuhan, and it must be resolutely run well. According to the school's report and the opinions discussed by the Central South Lecturers Group, since the beginning of the school, the vast majority of lecturers are willing to teach well and teach seriously; the vast majority of students have a high enthusiasm for learning and are actively learning; therefore, they have achieved certain results. However, there are still shortcomings in the work of the night school: some individual lecturers lack preparation for the teaching content, the connection between lecturers and between lectures is insufficient, and the course content is repetitive and complicated; a small number of students are frequently absent from class, do not study on their own, or rarely study on their own; the night school lacks necessary contact with the various Party committees and is not very familiar with the students' self-study situation. These shortcomings need to be overcome urgently. In order to improve the work of the night school on the existing basis, we hereby issue the following instructions, hoping that you will pay attention to them.

　　(1) The quality of teaching plays a decisive role in the success or failure of teaching. The night school should take continuously improving the quality of teaching and improving teaching methods as its main task. Therefore, it is required to strengthen the work of the lecturers group, regularly convene lecturers' meetings to exchange teaching experience and discuss teaching methods; study the connection between lectures and the teaching center of each lecture, so that the course content is streamlined and has clear logic, scientificity, and planning. Lecturers with the same course nature or direct content should form teaching groups, and the teaching outline should be discussed by the teaching group. The content of the outline should generally include: the purpose and requirements of studying a certain lesson or lecture; introducing its main content; criticizing erroneous ideas; proposing review and discussion topics, and pointing out necessary reference books and documents. After a unit (or a lesson) is completed, the lecturer should lead the students to review and discuss, and make a brief conclusion to deepen the students' understanding of the course and consolidate teaching achievements.

　　(2) The learning method is basically based on lecturers' teaching, but students' self-study must be emphasized. Each student must formulate a study plan based on the progress of the course, submit it to the Party branch for approval, and report it to the night school. The Party branch should call on and encourage them to develop the habit of reading on their own. The focus of the night school's tutoring work should be on cultivating their self-study and reading abilities. The tutoring work and the activities of the study group should focus on checking self-study situations, discussing students' review and discussion outlines, and guiding students to write outlines. In order to make students understand the importance of theoretical study, they should be repeatedly pointed out: Studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is a condition for achieving revolutionary victory and consolidating and developing victory, and it is the obligation of every Party member; only by strengthening study can we do our job well and serve the people better. Learning is a difficult process. Everyone must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, adhere to the "regular," "respectful," and "honest" learning attitude, the "squeeze" and "drill" learning methods, and persist in learning in order to learn what we don't understand. We must study hard now in order to be able to teach well in the future. All views that oppose work and study, and the view that they are not actively studying because of busy work, are one-sided and wrong.

　　(3) The night school should establish close contact with the Party committees and branches of various agencies, and promptly reflect the students' learning situation to the Party committees in order to obtain the assistance of the Party committees in their work. The Party committees and branches of various agencies should regard the training of theory instructors as a serious work task and political task, ensure that students' class time is not violated, and have appropriate self-study time; regularly supervise and check students' learning and solve their practical difficulties. We suggest that the Party committees of various agencies check the students' learning situation once in the near future, commend the good ones, and criticize the bad ones; make appropriate treatment for those who are frequently absent from class according to the circumstances, and notify the night school of the results. All phenomena of not seriously leading, supervising, and checking learning are hoped to be corrected as soon as possible.

### 中南局宣传部关于加强武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜间学校工作的指示

　　中南局宣传部关于加强武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜间学校工作的指示
    编者按：用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想教育干部，提高干部的理论水平，进一步改进我们的工作，乃是党的主要工作之一。各地党的组织应该抽出一定数量的有能力的干部，专门负责这一工作，在物质上给予一定的保证，领导部门要加强对这个工作的日常领导，这是搞好干部教育工作的先决条件。
    以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想教育干部，是提高干部改进工作的根本方法，是党的主要工作之一。对在职干部的理论学习要有经常的具体的指导，就需要有一批党的理论教员来担任这个工作。因此，训练、培养理论教员是开展干部学习的中心一环。马克思列宁主义夜间学校是为了培养驻武汉市各机关干部学习的理论教员而设的。夜校办理得成功或失败，对开展驻武汉市各机关干部学习有极其重大的影响，必须坚决地把它办好。根据该校报告，以及中南讲师团讨论的意见，自开学以来，极大多数的讲师是愿意教好的，认真教课的；绝大多数的学员的学习热情是很高的，是积极向学的；因而也就获得了一定的成绩。但夜校工作还存在着缺点：有个别的讲师对教学内容缺乏准备，各讲师间的、各课各讲间的联系不够，课程内容重复、庞杂；有少数的学员经常缺课、不自学或很少自学；夜校与各党委缺少必要的联系，对学员的自学情况不很熟悉。这些缺点，是急待克服的。为了使夜校的工作在现有的基础上提高一步，我们特作如下的指示，望即注意。
    （一）教学质量的高低，对教学成绩的好坏起着决定性的作用。夜校应以不断地提高教学质量、改进教学方法为其主要工作任务。因此要求加强对讲师团的工作，定期召集讲师会议交流教学经验，讨论教学方法；研究各课各讲之间的联系及其讲授中心，使课程内容精简，具有明确的逻辑性、科学性和计划性。课程性质相同或讲授内容有直接联系的各讲师应组成教学小组，讲授提纲要经过教学小组讨论。提纲的内容，一般的应包括：学习某一课某一讲的目的和要求；介绍其主要内容；批判错误思想；提出复习讨论题目，指出必要的参考书籍和文件。在一个单元（或一课）结束后，由讲师领导学员进行复习讨论，并作出简要的结论，以加深学员对课程的理解，巩固教学成绩。
    （二）学习方法基本上以讲师讲授为主，但必须强调学员的自学。每个学员均须根据课程的进度订出学习计划，交党支部批准，并报夜校。党支部要号召与鼓励他们养成自己读书的习惯，夜校辅导工作的重点应放在培养他们的自学和阅读能力上面，辅导工作和学习小组的活动以检查自学情况、讨论学员的复习讨论发言提纲和指导学员写发言提纲为主要内容。为了使学员明了理论学习的重要性，应向学员反复地指出：学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，是取得革命胜利、巩固和发展胜利的条件，是每个党员的义务；只有加强学习，才能做好工作，更好地为人民服务。学习是一个艰苦的过程，大家必须遵照毛主席的指示，抱定“规规矩矩”、“恭恭敬敬”和“老老实实”的学习态度，“挤”和“钻”的学习方法，坚持不懈地学习，才能学会不懂的东西。现在必须认真地学，将来才有可能教好。一切把工作与学习对立起来的看法，以及借口工作忙而不积极学习的观点是片面的，错误的。
    （三）夜校与各机关党委和支部应建立密切的联系，及时向党委反映学员的学习情况，以便在工作上取得党委的协助。各机关党委和支部应将培养理论教员视为一个严重的工作任务与政治任务，保证学员上课的时间不受侵犯，并有适当的自学时间；经常督促、检查学员的学习，解决其实际困难。我们建议各机关党委在最近检查一次学员的学习情况，好的予以表扬，坏的予以批评；对经常缺课的要分别情况作适当的处理，并将结果通知夜校。一切不认真领导、督促和检查学习的现象，望能尽快地纠正过来。
