    The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Marxist-Leninist Night School was established to train political theory teachers (i.e., study guides) for the Party and officially opened on April 19th of this year. The school has 549 formal students and 405 auditors. The curriculum is divided into three subjects: Foundations of Marxism-Leninism, Basic Questions of the Chinese Revolution, and Political Common Sense. The majority of comrades have consistently maintained a normal learning attitude.

    Understanding and grasping the characteristics of the night school is the basis for improving teaching methods. What are the characteristics of the night school?

    First, the vast majority of students are in-service cadres, so attendance is irregular. The lowest student attendance is only 65.5%, and the highest is only a little over 78%. The contradiction between learning and work does exist in fact, and appropriate methods and perseverance are necessary to overcome this difficulty.

    Second, the students are all active elements selected by the various branches who are relatively good at studying. They plan to lead the study after being trained. Therefore, they are prone to being overly eager for success and having excessively high demands.

    Third, the lecturers and students are extremely scattered, which makes it difficult to understand and grasp the actual situation of teaching and to organize them for leadership. Therefore, the regular leadership and inspection of the students by the various Party committees and branches, and the efforts of the night school cadres are very important.

    Fourth, the students' situations are very complex and their levels vary. According to incomplete statistics: 10 Party members from the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, 200 from the War of Resistance Against Japan, 199 from the War of Liberation, and 94 from after the founding of New China. They all have a certain amount of struggle experience, political theory cultivation, and cultural level, but they are also extremely inconsistent.

    Fifth, most of the lecturers are responsible comrades from various departments, and their time and energy are limited. Therefore, it is difficult to understand the students' situation and research teaching methods; it is also difficult to read a lot of materials to prepare carefully, and sometimes they cannot provide an outline before the lecture due to some matter, or they have to find someone to substitute temporarily. This cannot but affect the teaching work.

    Has the night school's teaching grasped these characteristics?

    In general, the students are satisfied with the lecturers' teaching. Many lecturers are conscientious and responsible and can listen to the students' opinions.

    Some lecturers are particularly popular because they carefully prepare outlines, and the content of their lectures is substantial, systematic, analytical, and well-organized. Or they are focused and provide appropriate examples.

    What are the main requirements of the students for the lectures?

    First, there should be a focus, it should be concise and essential, with more analysis and explanation on the central or key issues.

    Second, there should be theory and practice, so that experienced comrades can integrate experience from theory; those with book knowledge can understand theory from the actual experience of the revolution. We must enable everyone to acquire some systematic and basic theoretical knowledge, rather than memorizing Party policies or historical facts.

    Third, there should be inspiration. The central issues and research methods of the lecture should be put forward, as well as a summary of reference books.

    In general, the students' learning is active and humble. For example, in the Basic Questions of the Chinese Revolution course, more than 62% of the comrades regularly attend classes and rarely ask for leave. However, there are also problems that cannot be ignored, that is, the gains from learning are not great enough, not deep enough, the emotions of some comrades are somewhat low, and there are many absences, which deserves serious attention.

    The first problem here is the students' ideological problem. That is, they take theoretical study too lightly and demand too much too quickly. They fantasize that they can learn Marxism-Leninism all at once with the least amount of energy and time, spending the least amount of effort, reading the fewest books, and can immediately improve their work; when they hit a snag, their emotions are low. Therefore, it is very necessary to correct the attitude of learning and make everyone understand that learning must adopt the method of being honest, squeezing in time, and drilling hard.

    The second problem is the problem of learning methods. Some comrades feel that they cannot learn anything, "sitting makes their butts hurt, seeing makes their eyes hurt, thinking makes their heads hurt," and they cannot figure it out. The group discussions go on for half a day and no problems can be discussed, and no one can solve the problems. There are too many reference books, and they don't know where to start. Therefore, it is necessary for the lecturers to propose central review questions (not to find other problems) and a certain limit of reference books.

    The third problem is the system and leadership of learning. The experience of many groups proves that it is absolutely necessary to establish personal plans and group covenants (or group plans), establish a group leave system, and hold regular meetings.

    The central link of leadership is the Party committee and branch, as well as administrative care and supervision. After the Directly Subordinate Party Committee of the Central South Bureau convened a meeting of branch secretaries, the Communist Youth League School and the Central South Women's Committee convened a meeting of study guides, thereby eliminating absenteeism. The Municipal Party Committee and the District Party Committees regularly supervise and inspect, so that five of the six groups can regularly meet, and attendance is also more complete. The administrative and branch responsible comrades of Guanghua Line Factory, Central South Federation of Trade Unions, Municipal Taxation Fourth Branch, Central South Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School, etc., give the students encouragement, encouragement and support. Therefore, the students submit their study plans to the Party branch for approval and obtain administrative consent. The leadership given to the students by the Party committee and branch is an important condition for ensuring good learning.

    We have already achieved some results in the past two months. As long as everyone works hard, we will do better.

### 武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜校

　　武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜校
　　孙士祥
    武汉市机关马克思列宁主义夜校是为了训练党的政治理论教员（即学习指导员）而创办的，于今年四月十九日正式开学。全校有正式学员五四九人，旁听生四○五人。课程分马克思列宁主义基础、中国革命基本问题和政治常识三科。大多数同志的学习情绪一直是保持正常的。
    了解和掌握夜校的特点，是改进教学方法的依据。夜校有些什么特点呢？
    第一、学员绝大多数是在职干部，因之，到课的人数是不齐的。学员到课最少时，只有百分之六五·五；最多时也只有百分之七十八强。学习与工作的矛盾事实上是存在的，必须有适当的办法和坚持精神，才能克服这种困难。
    第二、学员都是各支部挑选出来在学习上较好的积极分子，他们打算在受训之后去领导学习。因此易于产生求成过急，要求过高的情绪。
    第三、讲师学员极其分散，这就很难于了解和掌握教学的实际情况，很难于把他们组织起来加以领导。因之，各党委、支部对学员的经常领导、检查和夜校工作干部的努力是很要紧的。
    第四、学员情况很复杂，程度不一。据不完整的统计：第一次和第二次国内革命战争时期的党员一○人，抗战时期的二○○人，解放战争时期的一九九人，新中国成立后的九四人。他们都有一定的斗争经验、政治理论修养和文化水平，可是又极不一致。
    第五、讲师多为各部门负责同志，时间和精力都有所限制，因此既难于了解学员的情况，研究教授方法；也难于多看材料精心准备，甚至于有时讲课不能先发提纲，或者因事临时不能来，只好找人代课。这就不能不影响教学工作。
    夜校的教学是否掌握了这些特点呢？
    对讲师的教授，学员一般是满意的。很多讲师认真负责，并能听取学员的意见。
    有些讲师之所以特别受到欢迎，是因为他们认真地准备了提纲，讲课内容也充实、有系统、有分析、条理分明。或者中心突出，举例恰当。
    学员们对讲授的主要要求是什么呢？
    第一、要有中心，要少而精，在中心的或关键的问题上多分析多说明。
    第二、要有理论有实际，使有经验的同志能从理论上来融会经验；有书本知识的能从革命的实际经验上来领会理论。要使大家获得一些系统的基本的理论知识，而不是背诵党的政策或历史事实。
    第三、要有启发性。要提出这一讲的中心问题和研究方法，以及扼要的参考书。
    学员的学习，一般都是积极虚心的。如中国革命基本问题科有百分之六十二以上的同志经常到课，很少请假。但是，同时也存在着不可忽视的问题，这就是学习的收获不够大，不深刻，部分同志的情绪有些低落，缺课人数很多，这是值得严重注意的。
    这里第一个问题是学员的思想问题。这就是把理论学习看得太轻易了，要求过急过高。幻想能够以最少的精力和时间，花最少的工夫，看最少的书，能一下子学完马克思列宁主义，而且可以立刻改进工作；碰了钉子，情绪就低落。因之，端正学习态度，使大家了解学习必须采取老老实实硬挤硬钻的办法，是非常必要的。
    第二个问题就是学习方法上的问题。有些同志感到学不出什么问题来，“坐得屁股痛，看得眼痛，想得头痛”，也摸不着门。小组会谈半天也谈不出问题来，有问题谁也难于解决。参考书太多，无从学起。因之，由讲师提出中心复习题（不是另外去找问题）和一定限度的参考书，是必要的。
    第三个问题就是学习的制度和领导问题。很多小组的经验证明：订立个人计划和小组公约（或小组计划），建立小组请假制度和定期的会议制度，是完全必要的。
    领导的中心一环是党委和支部，以及行政上的照顾和督促。中南局直属党委召开支部书记会议之后，团校和中南妇委召开了学习指导员会议，因而消除了旷课现象。市委四区委经常督促检查，使六个组中有五个能经常开会，到课也较齐。光华线厂、中南总工会、市税务四分局、中南总工会干部学校………等的行政和支部负责同志，给学员以督促、鼓励和支持。因之，学员把自己的学习计划提交党支部批准并取得行政上的同意。党委、支部给学员以领导是保证学好的重要条件。
    过去两个月我们已经取得了一些成绩，只要大家努力，我们会搞得更好。
