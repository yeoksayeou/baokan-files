    A Nightmare for Wall Street Bosses
    The day after Malik's radio address, American stocks, especially those of companies engaged in military production, fell sharply. US Secretary of Defense Wilson made a special speech to the National Industrial Advertisers Association, emphasizing that even if the Korean War ended tomorrow, the United States should continue to implement a huge arms program in order to alleviate the fears of arms manufacturers and speculators.
    It can be seen that the Wall Street monopolists who make a fortune from war are afraid of peace.
    Afraid of War, Also Afraid of Peace
    According to a report by the Chicago Daily News' correspondent in Japan, an American general in the Korean War reacted to Malik's proposal for a Korean armistice by saying: "Frankly, we want to end this mess. Seven divisions are stuck here. If they don't give us reinforcements, then we'll be stuck here for years to come. However, I am very afraid that if an agreement is reached, the Americans may return to a state of hibernation. Maybe mothers will start condemning service again, and stingy politicians may start cutting appropriations for rearmament."
    Afraid of war, also afraid of peace. This is a helpless confession.
            Monuments Cannot Be Destroyed
    A group of thugs in West Berlin vandalized the Soviet tank warrior monument erected on Potsdam Avenue in the American sector, painting it with black paint and setting it on fire with kerosene. When General Dankin, the representative of the Soviet Control Commission in Berlin, protested, Matthewson, the commander of the American sector, actually defended this atrocity, saying: "If this monument continues to exist in the American sector, it will become a source of irritation to the Germans."
    Obviously, the German people have unlimited respect for the heroic Soviet Red Army liberators; only the German fascists, like Matthewson, hate that monument.

    华尔街老板的噩耗
    在马立克发表广播演说后的第二天，美国股票，尤其是从事军事生产的企业的股票，却急剧下降。美国国防署署长威尔生特地向全国工业广告业协会发表演说，强调即使朝鲜战争明天结束，美国仍应该继续实行庞大的军备计划，以图减轻军火制造商和投机商人的恐惧。
    可见，靠战争发财的华尔街垄断资本家是害怕和平的。
    怕战争，也怕和平
    据美国《芝加哥每日新闻》驻日本记者报道，侵朝美军中的一位将军对马立克关于朝鲜停战建议的反应是：“坦白地说，我们希望结束这种混乱情况。七个师陷在这里了。如果他们不给我们增援，那么我们就要年深日久地陷在这里。不过，我很害怕，如果达成了协议，美国人就可能回到冬眠状态了。也许母亲们又要开始谴责服役，而吝啬的政客则可能着手削减重整军备的拨款了。”
    害怕战争，也害怕和平。这是无可奈何的招供。
            纪念碑是毁灭不了的
    柏林西区一群暴徒把竖立在美占区内波茨坦大道上的苏联坦克战士纪念碑加以毁坏，涂上黑颜料，并倒上煤油放火烧毁。当苏联驻柏林管制委员会代表旦金将军提出抗议时，美占区司令马休森竟为这种暴行辩护说：“如果让这一座纪念碑在美占区内继续存在，就会成为激怒德国人的一个根源。”
    显然，德国人民对于英勇的苏联红军解放者是无限尊敬的；只有德国的法西斯分子才和马休森一样，憎恨那座纪念碑。
