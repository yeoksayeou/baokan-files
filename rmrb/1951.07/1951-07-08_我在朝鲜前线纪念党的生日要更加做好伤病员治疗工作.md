　　I Commemorate the Party's Birthday on the Korean Front
    By Working Harder to Treat the Wounded
    Li Landing
    I am commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of our Party on the Korean front, defending world peace and opposing the American war of aggression. I am deeply grateful that I received the Party's education in my youth and participated in the revolution; soon after, I gloriously joined the Party. The Party's cultivation and the education of Mao Zedong Thought have shaped my character of fighting the enemy again and again and being loyal to the people's cause. The Party has made me a good soldier of the people and given me great honor. All this is given to me by the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    In the fierce struggle to defend world peace and oppose the American war of aggression, our Shanghai Military Medical University Volunteer Surgical Team and the Second Anti-American Aid Korea Surgical Team are working in various combat units and front-line hospitals on the Korean front. Amidst enemy bombing and strafing, on the battle lines of artillery fire, and in air-raid shelters, we overcome all kinds of difficulties and selflessly treat the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army. We do our utmost to reduce the suffering of the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army and save the precious lives of the heroic wounded Volunteer soldiers, so that many commanders and fighters can shake hands with us healthily and return to the battlefield to strike at the enemy. In the past seven months, more than half of the doctors and nurses in our team have gloriously received merit citations.
    In order to defend peace and defend our great and beloved motherland, we must firmly remember what Chairman Mao taught us: "Heal the wounded, rescue the dying, and practice revolutionary humanitarianism!" Serve the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army wholeheartedly, so that the final victory of the Korean War will come soon, to celebrate the glorious and great thirtieth anniversary of the Party.

　　我在朝鲜前线纪念党的生日
    要更加做好伤病员治疗工作
    李蓝丁
    我在保卫世界和平、反对美国侵略战争的朝鲜前线，来纪念我们党成立三十周年纪念日。我深深庆幸：我在少年时代就受到了党的教育，参加了革命；不久就光荣地参加了党。党的培养和毛泽东思想的教育，使我养成了对敌人战斗再战斗、对人民事业忠诚的性格。党使我成为一个人民的好战士，受到极大的荣誉。这一切都是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席给我的。
    在保卫世界和平、反对美国侵略战争的激烈斗争中，我们上海军医大学志愿手术队和抗美援朝手术二大队分布在朝鲜前线战斗部队和前线医院各地工作着。我们在敌机轰炸扫射中、炮火爆炸的战线上、防空洞里，克服种种困难，以忘我的精神为志愿军伤员进行治疗工作。我们尽我们一切力量来减少志愿军伤病员的痛苦，挽救英勇负伤志愿军可贵的生命，使许多指战员们健康地和我们握别，重新走上战场打击敌人。七个多月来，我们队里的大夫、护士已有半数以上光荣地立了功。
    为了保卫和平、保卫我们伟大可爱的祖国，我们一定牢牢记住毛主席所教导我们的话：“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义！”全心全意为志愿军伤病员服务，使朝鲜战争的最后胜利早日到来，来庆祝光荣伟大的党的三十周年。
