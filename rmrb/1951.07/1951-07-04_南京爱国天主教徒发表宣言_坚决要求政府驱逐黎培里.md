Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Supported by the people of the whole country and warmly encouraged by patriotic religious believers in various places, patriotic Catholics in Nanjing have launched a righteous struggle from the bottom up against the imperialist element, Monaco national Archbishop Riberi, for undermining the patriotic Three-Self Reform Movement of Catholics.

Seven hundred and fifty-eight patriotic Catholics have jointly issued a declaration, resolutely demanding that the government expel the imperialist element, Archbishop Riberi, from China.

The Catholic Diocese of Nanjing was long controlled by imperialist elements, who used the church to carry out aggressive and anti-Chinese people's criminal activities. After liberation, hidden imperialist elements and their running dogs continued to maliciously fabricate rumors and slander the People's Government, sow discord and alienation between patriotic Catholics and the People's Government, and vainly attempted to continue spreading ideological poison to deceive Catholics and undermine the patriotic movement of Catholics. However, after two years of personal experience and study in their lives, the majority of Catholics have begun to liberate themselves from the ideological shackles of imperialism, and their political understanding has gradually increased. Therefore, they have recognized the crimes of imperialist elements in undermining the Catholic patriotic movement and expressed unparalleled anger. The patriotic declaration of more than 700 Catholics was produced on this basis. Among those who signed the declaration were Li Weiguang, acting bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Nanjing, Wang XingTian, Vicar General of the Catholic Diocese of Nanjing, Sun Chifang, Principal of Nanjing Municipal No. 9 Middle School (formerly Hongguang Middle School), and other patriotic Catholics. The full text of the declaration is as follows: Compatriots and Catholic brothers and sisters across the country:

　　Since the Opium War, due to its inherent nature of aggression, imperialists have used various unequal treaties to invade our country, and further kidnapped the church to carry out their aggressive conspiracy, making the sanctity of our church suffer the stain of imperialists. In particular, the Nanjing Diocese was controlled by the imperialist running dog Yu Bin before liberation. He served American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This is something that every patriotic Catholic hates and cannot tolerate.

　　After liberation, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we have raised our political awareness and recognized the ferocious face of imperialists. On the basis of loving the country and loving the church, our Nanjing Diocese issued a joint declaration responding to the patriotic movement. We resolutely support the Common Program, eliminate all imperialist influences in the Chinese church, resolutely oppose the Roman Curia's interference in China's internal affairs, and implement the Three-Self Reform Movement of Catholicism in China. However, Archbishop Riberi wrote a letter to the bishops of various Catholic dioceses in China, openly obstructing our patriotic movement. He said of our declaration: "I am deeply saddened." We are determined to eliminate imperialist elements and their influence in the church for the sake of loving our country and protecting the purity of the church. Why is he saddened! Isn't it obvious that because our vast number of patriotic Catholics have awakened, imperialist elements can no longer use religion to carry out aggression to achieve the enslavement of the Chinese people and feel sad? Archbishop Riberi also said: "I cannot agree with this declaration." Our patriotic reform movement is a matter internal to us Chinese Catholics. What right does Archbishop Riberi have to obstruct us? Archbishop Riberi also said "the enemy's tricks." The "enemy" he refers to is clearly the Chinese people, including patriotic Catholics, and the People's Government. He insults our great motherland and the people of our motherland in this way, fully exposing the ferocious face of imperialists. We can never tolerate it. On the basis of loving the country and loving the church, we Catholics must strive for the renewal and brilliant future of the church. We resolutely demand that the People's Government expel this imperialist element from the land of our great motherland. Archbishop Riberi's conspiracy will not only fail to hinder our patriotic actions as Catholics, but will instead strengthen our determination to fight against imperialism. We resolutely stand on the side of the people and use practical strength and actions to smash the imperialist conspiracy to use religion for aggression.

　　Compatriots and Catholic brothers and sisters across the country, we sincerely thank you for your condolences and support. We must strengthen unity and strive for the great victory of the Three-Self Reform Movement in order to thoroughly eliminate all imperialist forces and influences in the church.

　　南京爱国天主教徒发表宣言
    坚决要求政府驱逐黎培里
    【本报讯】据新华社南京二十七日电：在全国人民积极支持和各地爱国宗教信徒热情鼓励下，南京市爱国天主教徒自下而上地展开了反对帝国主义分子摩纳哥侨民黎培里破坏爱国天主教徒三自革新运动的正义斗争。
    七百五十八位爱国天主教徒已联名发表宣言，坚决要求政府把帝国主义分子黎培里驱逐出中国去。
    天主教南京教区曾经长期被帝国主义分子所控制，他们利用教会进行侵略与反对中国人民的罪恶活动。解放后，暗藏的帝国主义分子及其走狗还继续恶毒造谣诬蔑人民政府，挑拨、离间爱国教徒与人民政府的团结，妄图继续散布思想毒素蒙蔽教徒，破坏教徒爱国运动。但大多数教徒经过两年来在生活中亲身的体会和学习，已开始从帝国主义思想桎梏中解放出来，政治认识逐渐提高，因而认清了帝国主义分子破坏天主教爱国运动的罪行，并表示了无比的愤怒。七百余位天主教徒的爱国宣言就是在这样的基础上产生的。在宣言上签名的有天主教南京教区代理主教李维光、天主教南京教区总司铎王性天、南京市立第九中学（原弘光中学）校长孙持方等爱国天主教徒。宣言全文如下：全国同胞暨天主教教友们：
    自鸦片战争以后，帝国主义者由于它侵略的本质，利用各种不平等条约，侵略我国，并且更进一步地劫持教会，进行其侵略的阴谋，使我们教会的圣洁，蒙受了帝国主义者的玷污。尤其是南京教区，在解放前为帝国主义走狗于斌所把持，他为美帝国主义及蒋匪服务，这是我们每个爱国教徒所切齿痛恨而不能容忍的。
    解放后，在毛主席英明的领导下，我们提高了政治觉悟，认识了帝国主义者的狰狞面目。在爱国爱教的基础上，我们南京教区发表了响应爱国运动联合宣言，我们坚决拥护共同纲领，肃清帝国主义在中国教会内的一切影响，坚决反对罗马教廷干涉中国内政，实行天主教在中国的三自革新运动。可是，黎培里竟写信给中国天主教各区主教，公然阻挠我们这一爱国运动。他对我们的宣言说：“我深为悲痛”。我们为了热爱祖国，保护教会的纯洁，坚决地肃清教会内的帝国主义分子及其影响，他为什么悲痛呢！这不是很明显，因为我们广大爱国的天主教徒已经觉悟了，帝国主义分子不能再利用宗教进行侵略来达到奴役中国人民而感到悲痛吗？黎培里还说：“我也不能赞同此宣言。”我们的爱国革新运动是我们中国教徒自己内部的事，黎培里有什么权利阻挠我们呢？黎培里还说“敌人的诡计”。他所谓“敌人”显然是指包括爱国天主教徒在内的中国人民和人民政府，他如此侮辱我们的伟大祖国和我们祖国的人民，充分暴露了帝国主义者的狰狞面目。我们是决不能容忍的。我们天主教徒在爱国爱教的基础上，一定要争取教会的革新与光辉的前途。我们坚决要求人民政府将这帝国主义分子，从伟大祖国的土地上驱逐出去。黎培里的这一阴谋，不但不能阻挠我们教徒爱国的行动，相反地更加强了我们对帝国主义斗争的决心。我们坚决站在人民的一边，用实际的力量与行动来粉碎帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的阴谋。
    全国的同胞们，教友们，我们衷心地感谢你们的慰问和支援，我们一定要加强团结，为彻底肃清教会中帝国主义的一切势力与影响，争取三自革新运动的伟大胜利而努力。
