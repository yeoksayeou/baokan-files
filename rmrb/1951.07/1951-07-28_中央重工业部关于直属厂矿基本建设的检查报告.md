　　Central Heavy Industry Department's Inspection Report on Basic Construction of Directly Subordinate Factories and Mines
    In accordance with the spirit of the "Notice Regarding Inspection of Basic Construction" issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on June 19th, we have held several meetings to conduct a special review of the problems that occurred in the basic construction undertaken by the Ministry in directly subordinate factories and mines in 1950 and the first half of 1951. We deeply feel the importance of the position we hold in national construction, and therefore, any errors in our work must be rectified promptly and thoroughly. Any attitude that is satisfied with partial achievements while ignoring shortcomings will be detrimental to the people's cause.

  (1) Basic Situation

    The basic construction carried out by the Ministry in 1950 and 1951 can be divided into two categories: one is the construction of new enterprises, and the other is the restoration and expansion of old enterprises, with the latter accounting for a larger proportion of investment. The former are large-scale new enterprises, and except for a few that have completed the design and started preliminary construction, the rest are still in the stage of resource investigation, preliminary design, or technical design. The latter involves adding production equipment and auxiliary equipment to the existing base to adjust or expand the production capacity of each factory or mine.

    All enterprises and their leading organs directly under the Ministry have shown great interest and a high degree of enthusiasm for basic construction. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the achievements made in basic construction. However, due to the lack of experience of many comrades, and the existence of some incorrect views in the minds of some comrades, some shortcomings and errors have also occurred in our work. If we judge by the current level of our conditions and capabilities, it should be affirmed that the basic construction in the past two years has been mainly successful. However, if we do not pay attention to correcting the errors that have already occurred, it will lead to even greater errors as the people's construction cause develops.

    In the past year and the first half of this year, the main shortcomings or errors we have made in basic construction are as follows:

    1. In the restoration and development of old enterprises, there are the following errors: (1) Starting construction without an approved budget. For example, for a new construction project in a certain factory in Taiyuan, we changed the two projects approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council (hereinafter referred to as the "Financial and Economic Committee") into seven on our own, and then increased them to nine, and started construction before the budget was submitted. Even after the Financial and Economic Committee instructed "retain" on this budget, construction continued. Ultimately, the enterprise's production funds were diverted, and the state's investment plan was violated, placing our own work in a difficult and passive situation. (2) The unrealistic tendency to "go big." For example, in the same case mentioned above, two projects, after being completed, had to be utilized afterwards because they were too large. This tendency to "go big" is essentially a local viewpoint that isolates and prioritizes one's own enterprise. (3) Inaccurate investigation and research, hasty construction, and subsequent changes to the plan. For example, in the mining of a certain iron ore, construction and machine installation were carried out based only on incomplete data left by the Japanese and puppet regimes. However, after the work started, it was discovered that the ore seam was inclined and extended straight down, making mining difficult and costly, so it was decided to stop work. (4) Incomplete design, with budgets being added several times. For example, a chemical factory in Tianjin was carrying out a new construction project. After the design, approval, and completion of construction, it was discovered that one engineering procedure was still missing, so the budget had to be increased. After the budget was submitted, it was found that there were still deficiencies, and the budget was increased a second time, forming a lack of planning in the design.

    2. In new enterprises, there are the following errors: (1) Changing the product variety midway and changing the design principles midway, resulting in abandoning previous efforts and starting anew. For example, a chemical factory, after conducting a site survey and preliminary design for a year, decided to change its original product because it was not suitable, and the design work started anew. At this time, feeling that their own design was not very confident, they decided to change their own design principles to those designed by foreign experts. (2) The work steps were not appropriate enough, and there were some phenomena of reversal. In the same example mentioned above, only a design organization should have been established during the design process, but we simultaneously established a management organization for engineering construction, leaving some cadres with nothing to do. It has now been decided to reorganize. (3) There is a tendency to design and construct at the same time in the guiding ideology. Although it has not yet formed a work result, this situation has been manifested in some work deployments. For example, in a certain factory in Hubei, because its past design and material preparation had some foundation, a few comrades strongly advocated starting partial construction first to strive for production one year earlier; but they were unwilling to seriously consider whether doing so might conflict with the entire design (the existing foundation is only one-seventh of the planned scale of a product).

  (2) Experience and Review

    We believe that the basic reasons for the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors are both subjective and objective. On the subjective side, the main reason is that leading cadres at all levels have some erroneous viewpoints in their minds, such as the eagerness for quick success and the unrealistic viewpoint of "going big." Using these viewpoints to guide work will inevitably lead to problems. On the objective side, there are also some difficult situations, such as unclear resource conditions, lack of experience, and lack of technical cadres. For old enterprises, the main problem is that the enterprises themselves are unreasonable and urgently need rectification, which has led to some rash actions.

    Our work also has the following general shortcomings, which are also the cause of errors: (1) The leadership of policies and ideology is not deep enough. There is not enough understanding of the central government's general policy on basic construction—the policy of advancing in a planned and step-by-step manner, and there is a lack of systematic education work among cadres, resulting in long-term ideological differences among some leading cadres. (2) There is a lack of meticulous directional research and discussion on each new construction or the development of old factories; only partial and unsystematic discussions. Under this situation, there are disconnections in the work steps. And there is a lack of foresight and sensitivity to the problems that occur in the work, so it is not easy to correct the deviations in time. Therefore, it hinders the improvement of our work. In which specific work aspects did this situation cause deviations and errors? We have reviewed the following issues, which are our basic experiences.

  (1) Regarding the Thinking of Leaders at All Levels

    Some of our comrades universally, and increasingly severely as you go down the ranks, have the idea of "asking for more money and doing more things." The specific manifestation of this idea is that in each decision on investment request planning, the enterprise requests a larger number than the bureau, the bureau requests a larger number than the department, and the department requests a larger number than the Financial and Economic Committee. Therefore, it takes repeated discussions and bargaining to reach an agreement. The good side of this idea is enthusiasm for developing industry; the bad side is a lack of comprehensive consideration, a failure to estimate subjective strength, and a failure to study objective possibilities. As a result, a tendency toward impatience and empiricism is manifested in some comrades. These ideas have the following specific manifestations:

    1. Eagerness for quick success. Unwilling to strictly implement the procedures of investigation, design, approval, and then construction. Believing that this formal approach is not needed at present, but is a matter for formal construction in the future; even believing that: if we must do it this way, nothing will be accomplished, or at least things will be delayed. Therefore, advocating that "the state should just give the money, and we will be responsible for how to do it." People with this idea only see the objective need of so-called "everything waiting to be rebuilt," such as the fact that most of the enterprises received are unreasonable in terms of production equipment and urgently need adjustment and supplementation, and that basic industries are very lacking, such as steel, chemical, and machine manufacturing, which all urgently need construction. In addition, they only see some of our favorable conditions, such as political conditions, cadre enthusiasm, and certain financial and material resources, especially the Soviet Union's assistance to us, etc. At the same time, they believe that the leadership is not as aware of the actual situation as the cadres below, and there is no overall plan. Therefore, they believe that proceeding step by step will delay things, and it is in the best interest of the country to give full play to the enthusiasm of the lower levels and do things quickly and in large quantities. As the example of a certain factory in Hubei mentioned above shows. This idea is wrong. The most fundamental point of its error is that it lacks an accurate calculation of subjective strength—the amount of work that can be undertaken. It only sees the needs and certain favorable conditions, but does not fully consider all the conditions, such as underestimating the difficulties in terms of financial resources, human resources, and material resources. On the other hand, it only sees the temporary shortcomings of the leadership in understanding the situation and overall planning, and does not understand that the reason why the leading organs cannot really understand the various situations below is precisely because the lower levels lack timely provision of information.

    2. Fondness for greatness and eagerness for success. This idea is that it is better to be bigger than smaller, and better to be more than less. The responsible comrades of enterprises mostly want to run their own factories on a large scale. Whether a factory is run on a large or small scale should be determined by the overall layout of the industry, and the size and development steps of a factory should be determined from the overall division of labor and cooperation, and should not be blindly trying to run a large factory in isolation. For example, in the case of a certain factory in Taiyuan mentioned above, they tried their best to build the repair department in the factory into a relatively complete and capable machine manufacturing factory. As a result, the construction projects increased, the factory buildings also increased, and so on. They believe that doing so would make a greater contribution to the country and the people. This idea is a positive driving force for promoting national construction in subjective terms and should be consolidated and promoted, but once this idea deviates from the correct guidance of seeking truth from facts, it will make mistakes. The result of the factory's "fondness for greatness" violated the state's investment plan, and the work fell into a passive state.

    3. Not knowing that things are difficult and starting easily. Overly believing in subjective "creativity," advocating learning by doing, and relatively ignoring the scientific nature of industrial construction. Individual learning from experience by doing is allowed, but in large industrial construction, it is wrong to use "learning by doing" as a guiding ideology. Because we have not yet grasped the laws of large-scale construction, we do not realize that the construction of large enterprises cannot take a wrong step. If a drawing is designed incorrectly and cannot be corrected, it will also affect the overall situation. And using the experience of building small factories and workshops in the past to guide the construction of large enterprises, thinking that if there is a problem, everyone can solve it by holding a meeting, or that if something is wrong, it can be changed. Examples of reversed steps and easy changes occurred under this kind of thinking.

    We believe that these guiding ideologies all have a good aspect subjectively, and all want to produce more results for the people's cause quickly, but the results are bad and slow. These ideas are interconnected and have a certain basis, so they become an obstacle to running new projects well. Therefore, these ideas must be corrected. The main method is to honestly strengthen learning, earnestly summarize experience in a timely manner, and solve problems from the perspective of ideological understanding.

  (2) Regarding Several Specific Issues

    1. Regarding the overall policy of basic construction: (1) For new construction, we should fully estimate our own financial, material, human, and technical conditions, as well as foreign conditions—technical assistance and equipment supply. Do not be greedy for more, concentrate our forces, and run one project well at a time to cultivate capabilities and accumulate experience. At present, we should focus on preparation, conduct resource investigation and exploration, and personnel training. For factories whose designs have not been completed, we will never ask for more money to prevent having money but no strength, and shelving the country's useful financial resources. (2) Regarding the restoration and development of old enterprises, there has been a tendency in the past to value new and large enterprises and relatively ignore the so-called "lighter points," which should be corrected. For old enterprises, we should improve the utilization rate of their equipment, add necessary facilities to gradually make them complete, so as to maximize their production capacity. To this end, we should comprehensively study and determine the long-term construction direction of each existing enterprise to prevent unplanned and passive practices of seeing a point and doing it, adding here today and adding there tomorrow.

    2. Regarding the design policy: The design must be thorough and correct before construction can begin. This principle cannot be shaken and must be adhered to. It is estimated that we still have the design capability to carry out partial expansion and construction on the original basis; but we generally do not have the capability to design new and large enterprises. There have been different views on this aspect in the past. One view is that regardless of whether we are confident or not, we generally advocate not relying on foreign experts, doing it ourselves, or at least taking ourselves as the main force and only inviting a few experts to help. One view is that for all those who are not very confident, we should ask foreign experts to do it and use the method of taking apprentices to train our own designers and institutions. This view believes that the construction of large enterprises should not have any adventurous elements, and that our domestic technical experts generally lack comprehensive design capabilities at present. Everyone believes that the latter method should become the current design policy.

    3. Regarding foreign orders: The conditions for ordering (mainly referring to mechanical equipment) are the basis for conducting the design, that is, designing according to what specifications. In the past, we did not have a deep enough understanding of the importance of this issue. In today's view, this should be a key issue in basic construction. Some engineering and technical personnel are more familiar with the specifications of capitalist countries—mainly the United States, and have a part of the information of these countries, such as some design materials left over from the past of the United States or Japan (some materials left by the Kuomintang are basically American specifications). Therefore, they tend to design according to the specifications of these countries (mainly the United States). They believe that the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries will definitely help us enthusiastically (this is a fact) and accept any type of orders we need. This plan has proven to be unworkable in practice. All important large machine equipment must be ordered from the Soviet Union. And ordering from the Soviet Union, the so-called Anglo-American specifications are of course impossible. This plan contains an extremely important viewpoint, that is, the viewpoint on trade with the Soviet Union (and various new democratic countries), and the view on the relationship between countries in the world's peaceful and democratic camp in construction. The Soviet Union has a responsible attitude towards helping our construction. Capitalist countries currently do not even sell us ordinary machines and equipment. Why don't we adopt the better specifications of advanced countries, but ask them to manufacture products of another specification? The Soviet Union's trade with us (and with various new democratic countries) is not purely a commercial relationship, but first and foremost a political relationship. This trade relationship is first responsible for the effect of the trade, that is, whether it can guarantee the smooth completion of construction, rather than starting from the purpose of making money or losing money. If this situation is not grasped and this viewpoint is not established in the basic construction plan, it will inevitably lead to changes in the plan. Therefore, all foreign orders must be designed according to the specifications of the country accepting the order, otherwise the goods will not be ordered, and our own work will fail.

    According to the above review, it proves that the reason why we have made shortcomings and errors in our past work is mainly due to lack of experience and ideological deviations; and ideological deviations hinder us from accumulating and creating experience, and hinder our progress; therefore, the central link in improving this situation is to transform our thinking. All staff members of the Ministry, especially all administrative management cadres and engineering technical personnel, should make this effort.

    The Ministry of Heavy Industry still has other shortcomings in the past basic construction work, and even in the current work, such as the organization of work, and the clarity of the division of labor and responsibilities are not enough, so the efficiency of the work is not high enough. Various industrial bureaus and enterprises still have other shortcomings in the design and construction in basic construction, such as the quality of the project still has problems, and problems have occurred in the procurement of materials and contracting. To this end, all departments under the Ministry must, in accordance with the spirit of the Financial and Economic Committee's notice, seriously check the various problems that have occurred in their basic construction, find out the root causes of the problems, study the ways to overcome them, and gain experience and lessons to improve their work. And the results of the review should be appropriately published in the local newspapers.

    The construction of New China is only the beginning, and errors in the work cannot be completely avoided; but if we do not face up to and correct errors with a serious attitude, it is completely unjustifiable and unacceptable to the people. Our work has made great progress in the past two years; and we firmly believe that we can continue and make faster progress. The correct leadership of the Central People's Government, the assistance of specialists from advanced fraternal countries, coupled with our own active efforts, will be the guarantee of our progress and the guarantee of completing the national task. In the future, we should better carry out criticism and self-criticism, and ask the higher authorities and the masses of the people to have more supervision and guidance on us to accelerate our progress.

　　中央重工业部关于直属厂矿基本建设的检查报告
    根据政务院财政经济委员会六月十九日发布的关于检查基本建设的通知的精神，我们连续召集了若干会议，对于本部在一九五○年及一九五一年上半年在直属厂矿进行基本建设中所发生的问题，作了专门检讨。我们深感自己在国家建设中站立的岗位的重要性，因之对于自身工作中的任何错误，都必须迅速而彻底地纠正。任何满足于部分成绩而忽视缺点的态度，均将有害于人民的事业。
  （一）基本情况
    本部在一九五○年和一九五一年进行的基本建设，可以分作两类：一类是建设新企业，一类是恢复和扩大旧企业，投资比重以后者为主。前一类是规模较大的新型企业，除个别已完成设计，开始初步施工外，其余均尚在调查资源、初步设计或进行技术设计阶段。后一类则是在原有基础上增建生产设备和附属设备，以调整或扩大各该厂矿的生产能力。
    本部直属各企业及其领导机关，对于基本建设均抱着极大的兴趣，并表现了高度的积极性，这是使基本建设获得成绩的根本原因之一；但由于许多同志还缺乏经验，以及某些同志在思想上还存在着若干不正确的观点，因之也使我们的工作发生了一些缺点和错误。如果以我们现有的条件与能力的水准来评判，应当肯定，两年来的基本建设还是以成绩为主的。但如果对于已经发生的错误，不注意改正，则将随着人民建设事业的发展，而招致更大的错误。
    去年一年及今年上半年，我们在基本建设中主要发生了以下的缺点或错误。
    一、在旧企业的恢复和发展中，有这样一些错误：（一）不经批准预算即行施工的错误。如太原某工厂的某一新建工程，我们将政务院财政经济委员会（以下简称财委）批准的两个工程项目，自行改为七个，而后又增至九个，并在预算送出之前即开始施工。而在财委对此项预算批示“保留”后，仍继续施工。终至挪用了企业的生产资金，并抵触了国家的投资计划，使自己的工作也陷于难以收拾的被动境况。（二）不切合实际的“好大”倾向。如在上述同一事例中，有两项工程在建筑完成以后，因为太大了，不得不事后设法利用。这种“好大”的倾向，实质上是孤立地为自己企业打主意的局部观点。（三）调查研究不确，仓促施工，事后改变计划。如开采某一铁矿，仅仅根据了日伪遗留的不完整的资料，即进行建设和按装机器。但在动工后，发现矿层系斜直下伸状，采掘困难，成本高昂，只好决定停工。（四）设计不周全，数次追加预算。如天津某化学工厂，进行一项新建工程，经过设计、批准至施工完成后，才发现尚缺一个工程程序，只好追加预算；预算送出后，发现还有欠缺，又二次追加，形成设计上的无计划性。
    二、在新建企业中，则有下列一些错误：（一）产品品种中途改变，设计方针中途改变，以致前功半弃，从新开始。如某化学工厂，在进行厂址调查和初步设计一年之后，因原定产品不适用而决定改变，设计工作即从新开始。这时感觉自己设计尚无十分把握，又决定将自己设计的方针改为聘请国外专家设计的方针。（二）工作步骤不够适当，有某些前后倒置现象。上述同一例子，在设计过程中本来只应建立设计机构，而我们却同时建立了工程建设的管理机构，使一部分干部无事可做，现已决定改组。（三）指导思想中有一面设计一面施工的倾向。虽尚未形成工作的结果，但在某些工作部署上，已表现了这种情况。如湖北某工厂，因其过去的设计和物资准备有一些基础，因之少数同志极力主张先行部分施工，争取早一年生产；而对于这样做是否可能抵触全部设计（现有基础只为预定规模中一项产品的七分之一）则不愿认真顾及。
  （二）经验和检讨
    发生上述缺点和错误的基本原因，我们认为有主观的和客观的两个方面。在主观方面，主要是各级领导干部思想上有某些错误观点，譬如急于求成和不切合实际的“好大”的观点，用这些观点指导工作，一定发生毛病。在客观方面，也有些困难情形，譬如：资源情况不明，经验不足，技术干部缺乏等。对于旧企业来说，主要是企业本身不合理，急需整顿，从而促成了某些轻率行动。
    我们的工作中还有以下带一般性的缺点，也是发生错误的原因：（一）政策思想领导不够深入，对于中央关于基本建设的总方针——有计划有步骤稳步前进的方针，体会不够，并且缺少在干部中进行有系统的教育工作，以致带原则性的思想分歧在某些领导干部中长期存在。（二）对每一项新的建设或旧厂的发展，缺少缜密的方针性的研究和讨论；只有部分人的，不够系统的商讨。在这种情况之下，工作步骤即有脱节现象。而对工作中发生的问题，则缺乏预见性和敏感性，因之有了偏差亦不易及时纠正。（三）掌握情况不够，缺少有力的检查。这就使得我们不能主动地去发现问题；在问题发生之后，也不易做出恰合情况的结论。因之，就妨碍了我们的工作的提高。这种情况使我们在那些具体工作方面发生了偏差和错误呢？我们检讨了以下几个问题，这是我们的基本经验。
  （一）关于各级领导思想
    我们有些同志普遍地而且是愈往下愈严重地有“多要钱，多办事”的思想。这种思想的具体表现，是在每一次决定投资要求计划时，企业要求数字比局大，局比部大，部又比财委大。于是经过反复讨论，讨价还价一番才能议定。这种思想的好的一面是热心发展工业；其不好的一面，是缺乏全面的考虑，不估计主观的力量，不研究客观的可能性；因而在一部分同志中表现了急性病和经验主义的倾向。这些思想有以下具体表现：
    １、急欲求成。不愿严格执行调查、设计、批准而后施工的程序。认为这种正规的作法，在目前还不需要，而是以后正规建设时的事情；甚至认为：倘若一定要这样办，那将会一事无成，至少是误事的。因而主张“国家只管拿钱好了，至于如何去做可由我们负责”。有这种思想的人，只是看到了所谓“百废待兴”的客观需要，比如所接收的企业，大部分在生产装备上不合理，急需调整和补充，和基础工业又甚缺乏，如钢铁，化工，机器制造等均急需建设。另外又只看到我们的某些有利条件，如政治条件，干部积极性，及一定的财力和物力条件，尤其是苏联对我们的帮助等等。同时，他们认为在国家领导方面，不如下面干部了解的情况切实，也还无通盘的计划。因之他们认为按部就班是误事的，当该是尽量发挥下面的积极性，快办多办，才对国家有利。如前述湖北某厂的例子就是如此。这种思想是错误的，其所以错误，最根本的一点是对于主观的力量——能够担负的工作量，缺乏精确的计算，只看到了需要和某些有利条件，而对全部条件考虑不足，比如对财力、人力、物力等方面的困难估计不足。它另方面却只看到领导上在了解情况与通盘计划方面的暂时的缺点，不了解领导机关之所以还不能切实地了解下面的各种情况，其原因正是下边缺少及时地提供情况。
    ２、好大喜功。这种思想是，宁愿大些不愿小些，宁愿多些不愿少些。企业的负责同志，多数愿意自己的工厂办大。工厂办大办小，应该决定于整个工业的布局，从整体分工配合中决定一个工厂的大小及发展步骤，而不应该孤立地盲目地要办大厂。比如前述太原某厂的例子，他们极力想把厂内的修理部，建设成一个比较完整的有能力的机器制造厂，因之工程项目就增加了，厂房建筑也加大了等等，他们认为这样办对国家和人民的供献才大。这种想法在主观上是推进国家建设的积极动力，应当巩固和发扬，但这种想法一旦离开实事求是的正确的指导，就会犯错误。该厂“好大”的结果，就抵触了国家的投资计划，工作陷于被动。
    ３、不知事情难办，轻易动手。过分相信主观的“创造性”，主张边做边摸，而相对地忽视了工业建设的科学性。个别的边做边摸的吸取经验是允许的，但在大的工业建设中，如果以“边做边摸”作为指导思想就不对了。由于我们还未掌握住大建设的规律，体会不到大企业的建设不能错走一步，一个图设计错了，如果不能纠正，也会影响全局。而以以前建设小工厂和作坊的经验，去指导大企业的建设，以为有了问题，大家开开会就可以解决，或者那里不对了再改改就好了。如步骤颠倒，轻易改变的例子就是在此种思想情况下发生的。
    这几种指导思想，我们认为，主观上都有其好的一个方面，都是想为人民事业快办出更多的成绩，但其结果却是坏的和慢的。这些思想是互相连系的，有其一定根据，因此成为办好新建工程的障碍。因之，必须纠正这些思想。主要办法是老老实实加强学习，及时认真总结经验，从思想认识上解决问题。
  （二）关于几个具体问题
    １、关于基本建设的总的方针问题：（一）对于新的建设，应充分估计自己的财力、物力、人力、技术等条件，及国外的条件——技术援助和装备的供应，不贪多，集中使用力量，办好一个是一个，以培养能力，积累经验。在目前应着重准备，进行资源调查与探钻和人员训练等。对于凡是设计未完成的工厂，决不多要钱，以防有钱无力，把国家有用的财力搁置起来。（二）关于旧企业的恢复和发展，过去曾有看重新的大的企业而比较地忽视所谓“轻点”的倾向，应加纠正。对旧企业应是提高其设备利用率，增添必要的设施，使其逐步完整，以尽量发挥其生产能力。为此，应对每一现有企业，通盘地研究和确定其长远的建设方向，以防看到一点办一点，今天添这里明天又添那里的无计划和被动的做法。
    ２、关于设计方针问题：设计必须周密和正确，然后才能施工，这一原则不容动摇，必须坚持。估计我们在原有基础上进行部分的扩大建设还有设计能力；而对于建设新型大企业的设计则一般尚无能力。在这一方面，过去曾有不同见解。一种主张是不考虑自己有无把握而一般地主张不靠国外专家，自己办，至少以自己为主只请少数专家帮助办。一种主张，凡无十分把握者，均应请外国专家办，而以带徒弟的办法，培养我们自己的设计人员和机构。这种主张认为，大企业的建设不应有任何冒险的成分，而我们本国的技术专家目前一般的还缺乏全面的设计能力。大家认为后一种办法应成为目前的设计方针。
    ３、关于国外订货问题：定货（主要指机械装备）条件是进行设计的根据，就是按照什么规格进行设计。我们过去对这一问题的重要性体会得还不够深刻，在今天来看，这应是一个在基本建设上的关键性的问题。一部分工程技术人员，由于比较熟悉资本主义国家——主要是美国的规格，并且掌握着一部分这些国家的资料，譬如：过去遗留下的美国的或日本的一些设计资料（国民党遗留的一些资料，基本上是美国规格的），因之就倾向于按照这些国家（主要为美国）的规格进行设计。他们认为苏联与各新民主主义国家，一定会对我们热心帮助（这是事实）而接受我们所需要的任何类型的定货。这种打算在事实上已证明行不通。凡是重要大机器设备，必需向苏联订货。而在苏联订货，以所谓英美规格当然不可能。这种打算包含着一个极其重要的观点，就是对苏联（以及各新民主主义国家）贸易的观点，及对世界和平民主阵营中各国家在建设上的关系的看法。苏联对我们的建设是抱着负责帮助的态度，资本主义国家在目前则连普通机器和器材都不卖给我们。我们为什么不采取先进国家的更好的规格，却要他们进行另一种规格的产品的制造呢？苏联对我们（以及对各新民主主义国家）在贸易上，不单纯是商业关系，而首先是政治关系。这种贸易关系，首先是对贸易的效果负责，亦即以能否保证建设的顺利完成为原则，而不是从赚钱赔钱的目的出发。如果在基本建设计划上，不掌握这一情况和确立这一观点，势必造成改变计划的结果。因此，凡是国外定货，必须按照接受定货国的规格设计，不然就定不到货，而使自己的工作落空。
    根据上述检讨，证明我们在过去工作中之所以发生缺点和错误，主要是由于经验不足和思想上有偏差所致；而思想上的偏差，则妨害我们积累和创造经验，妨碍我们的进步；因之，改进这一情况的中心环节是改造思想。本部一切工作人员，尤其是各项行政管理干部和工程技术人员，均应作此努力。
    重工业部在过去的基本建设工作中，甚至在目前工作中，还有其他方面的缺点，比如工作的组织性，分工与职责的明确性都还不够，从而使工作的效率不够高。各工业局及各企业在基本建设中的设计和施工上，尚有其他缺点，诸如工程质量还有毛病，材料购置以及包工上都发生过问题。为此，本部所属各部门均必须按照财委通知的精神，认真检查自己在基本建设中所发生的各种问题，找出发生问题的根源，研究克服的办法，取得经验和教训，以提高工作。并应将检讨的结果适当地在当地报纸上公布。
    新中国的建设，还仅仅是开端，工作中的错误不可能完全避免；但如果不以严肃的态度正视和改正错误，则是完全不应该的和为人民所不容许的。将近两年以来，我们的工作已有很大进步；我们并深信我们能够继续和更快地进步。中央人民政府的正确领导，先进的兄弟国家的专门家对我们的帮助，加上自己的积极努力，就成为我们进步的保证，也是完成国家任务的保证。今后我们应更好地展开批评与自我批评，要求上级和人民群众对我们有更多的监督和指导，以加速我们的进步。
