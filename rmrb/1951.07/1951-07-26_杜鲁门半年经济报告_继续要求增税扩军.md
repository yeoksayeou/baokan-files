　　Truman's Semi-Annual Economic Report
　　Continues to Demand Tax Increases and Military Expansion
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 25th] TASS, Washington: U.S. President Truman's semi-annual economic report to Congress was released on the 23rd. In the report, Truman reiterated that regardless of whether peace is restored in Korea, the United States must further increase its armed forces and expand its military production.
　　Truman said that the U.S. government is currently revising its current goals in strengthening its armed forces, and in the future, it will likely have to increase the figures for several important items.
　　Truman repeated the anti-Soviet slander, attempting to justify further increases in the military.
　　He pointed out that military expenditures have reached a level of more than $35 billion per year, which is 50% higher than the level six months ago. These expenditures are expected to reach a level of more than $50 billion per year by the end of this year, and will almost reach $65 billion by the end of 1952.
　　Truman emphasized that the amount of military expenditure will rise sharply, and he again recommended that Congress increase taxes by at least $10 billion this year.

　　杜鲁门半年经济报告
　  继续要求增税扩军
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国总统杜鲁门向国会提出的半年经济报告，已于二十三日发表。杜鲁门在报告中再度坚持，不论朝鲜是否恢复和平，必须进一步增加美国武装部队和扩大美国的军事生产。
    杜鲁门说，美国政府目前正在修改它在加强武装部队方面的当前目标，将来很可能必须增加若干重要项目的数字。
    杜鲁门重弹反苏诽谤的滥调，企图这样来证明进一步增加军队是必要的。
    他指出，军事支出已达到年率三百五十多亿美元的水平，这比半年前的水平高出百分之五十。这些支出到本年年底预定要达到年率五百多亿美元的水平，而到一九五二年年底时，几乎要达到六百五十亿美元。
    杜鲁门着重指出军事支出的数目将剧烈上升，他再度建议国会在本年至少要增税一百亿美元。
