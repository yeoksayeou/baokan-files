Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 30th: According to the Canadian Tribune, Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada, said at a mass rally in Vancouver on July 15th: "We welcome the Kaesong ceasefire negotiations, which is a victory for all those who yearn for world peace and strive for it. But never forget that the Washington imperialists will try to obstruct and undermine peace."

Speaking of the ceasefire negotiations that had been halted for a time due to the issue of journalists, Buck said, "These provocations by the United States have been defeated. The negotiations have resumed. The democratic people of Canada and the United States should celebrate this. The whole world thanks the Korean and Chinese people."

Buck then pointed out: "However, all Canadians must see this near-breakdown of negotiations as a serious warning sign." He said: "Now a national movement should be launched to demand that the Canadian government support peace in Korea and withdraw our soldiers back home."

    【新华社布拉格三十日电】据加拿大论坛报消息：加拿大劳工进步党总书记布克七月十五日在温哥华的群众集会上说：“我们欢迎开城的停火谈判，这是一切渴望世界和平并为之奋斗的人们的胜利。但是决不要忘记华盛顿的帝国主义者将设法阻挠与破坏和平。”
    布克在谈到停火谈判曾因新闻记者问题一度停止的事情时说：“美国的这些挑衅被击败了。谈判恢复了。加拿大和美国的民主人民当为此庆幸。整个世界都感谢朝鲜人民和中国人民。”
    布克接着指出：“但是，所有的加拿大人必须把这次谈判的几乎破裂，看做是一个严重的警号。”他说：“现在应该展开一个全国性的运动，要求加拿大政府支持朝鲜和平，并把我国的士兵撤回国来。”
