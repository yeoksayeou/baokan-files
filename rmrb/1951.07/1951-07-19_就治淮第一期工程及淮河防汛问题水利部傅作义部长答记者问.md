Xinhua News Agency, July 18th:

　　The key project of this year's Huai River project, the Runheji Diversion Sluice Project controlling the floodwaters of the Huai River's main stream, is expected to be completed on the 20th of this month, marking the completion of the first phase of the Huai River project. Now that the Huai River has entered the flood season, the entire project will be tested by this year's floods. Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources, on the situation of this project and the issues that should be paid attention to in this year's Huai River flood control. Minister Fu answered the reporter's questions as follows:

　　Q: The first phase of the Huai River project is about to be completed. Can you tell us about the main gains and experiences of this phase? What is the role and position of the first phase of the project in the entire project to fundamentally control the Huai River? What benefits have the progress and completion of the first phase of the project already had and will have for the people on both sides of the Huai River in overcoming disasters?

　　A: Due to Chairman Mao's love for the people, the Huai River project began immediately after the Huai River basin suffered a flood in 1950. According to the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, another such serious flood should be avoided in 1951, and a wheat harvest should be guaranteed in the spring of 1951. At the time, many people were highly skeptical, believing that such an arduous task could not be completed in such a short period. However, due to the active efforts of the working cadres of governments at all levels and all the migrant workers, and the vigorous cooperation of relevant departments, this project is now about to be completed victoriously. During the project, the number of migrant workers mobilized reached a maximum of 2.2 million; to transport grain and materials needed for the project, Anhui Province alone mobilized 8,314 various ships and 7,438 vehicles. A total of 30,000 administrative and technical cadres participated in organizing mobilization, project leadership, and surveying. These organizational and leadership experiences are very valuable. In particular, the successful construction of the Shimantan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Hong River and the huge Runheji Diversion Sluice Project in the middle reaches of the Huai River is of great educational significance to the national water conservancy engineering community at a time when China still lacks such experience.

　　The plan for the Huai River project is based on flood control, combined with the multi-objective basin development plan for irrigation and navigation. Premier Zhou instructed that the water disasters of the Huai River should be completely eliminated within five years. It is now estimated that, in terms of flood control engineering alone, the time may be slightly advanced. The first phase of the project completed this year is a part of the flood control project. Of course, the planning of these projects has already taken into account the needs of future irrigation and navigation projects.

　　Regarding the benefits of the Huai River project, it can be divided into several aspects. First of all, in terms of disaster relief, because the Huai River project started immediately after the major flood in 1950 and was carried out in the form of work relief, coupled with the production and disaster relief movement led by the local people's government, the masses affected by the disaster in the Huai River basin have completely overcome the famine, realizing the call of the Central People's Government to "not allow a single person to starve to death." Secondly, in terms of guaranteeing the wheat harvest, the wheat in the Huai River basin has all achieved a bumper harvest this year. The reason for this is that, in addition to the fact that the spring rain in the Huai River basin was not very heavy this year, the main reason is that drainage and emergency planting work were carried out in various parts of the Huai River basin last autumn, and dredging projects of the Huai River tributaries and ditch projects in some areas were carried out last winter and this spring. As for the estimation of the flood control benefits of the first phase of the project, under the principle of overall consideration of the upper, middle, and lower reaches, the upper reaches are mainly used for water storage projects, but it will take a long time to complete all the water storage reservoir projects. At the same time, in order to take care of the middle and lower reaches, the rectification of the upper reaches of the river cannot be carried out this year. Therefore, if the same flood as in 1950 is encountered this summer, the flood in Henan can be reduced, but the problem has not been fundamentally solved. In the middle reaches of northern Anhui, this year's project combines storage and discharge. In addition to storing more than 7.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater in the Chenxihu area west of Huoqiu County, some dredging projects have also been carried out, which are expected to achieve "disaster avoidance in light rain and disaster reduction in heavy rain." If the same flood as in 1950 is encountered, the dikes of the Huai River's main and tributary rivers in the vast areas east of the Ying River, west of the Hui River, and on the north bank of the Huai River in northern Anhui can be guaranteed not to breach. The problem of waterlogging in this area has also been partially solved, which can guarantee the wheat and autumn harvests. The urban area of Bengbu and the area where the Huainan Coal Mine is located can also be guaranteed not to be affected by the same flood as in 1950. As for the narrow strip of land between the south bank of the Huai River and the mountainous area, it must also be used to regulate the flow of the Huai River's main stream in the event of exceptionally large floods; in the area on the north bank of the Huai River east of the Hui River, the problem of drainage of the Huai River's tributaries and the inland water in this area has not been completely solved this year. If the above two areas encounter the same flood as in 1950, disasters may still occur. However, due to the water storage in the upper and middle reaches, the flood will definitely be reduced. In the lower reaches, after the Huai River flood is controlled and intercepted in the upper and middle reaches, it is estimated that the maximum flow rate of Zhongdu (the outlet of the Huai River from Hongze Lake into Gaobao Lake) will not exceed 8,500 cubic meters per second this year if the same flood as in 1950 is encountered. At the same time, the dikes of the Grand Canal have been greatly renovated this spring, so northern Jiangsu can be guaranteed safety this summer. However, in order to cope with unexpected adverse situations, such as the simultaneous occurrence of very large floods in the Yangtze River and the Huai River, and the backwater effect of the Yangtze River on the Huai River (this is a special situation that occurs once in decades), the Liyun River returning sea dam may also be opened.

　　Q: The Huai River is now in the flood season. What issues do you think all Huai River project personnel and the people in the Huai River basin should pay special attention to?

　　A: This year, the Huai River has established a basin-wide unified leadership flood control organization to unify the control of water conditions and the management of the flood storage lakes and culvert projects along the river. As for the defense of the dikes along the river, it is still the responsibility of each province and region to strengthen the leadership of local administrative organs in flood control. As for the things that should be paid attention to in this year's flood control, I think: First, the facilities for defending and regulating floods in the Huai River are more complicated than general simple dike construction and flood prevention projects. Therefore, close contact between the upper, middle, and lower reaches, and unified control of the storage and discharge operations of lakes and sluices are the most important things. Secondly, the more than 1,000 kilometers of dikes along the river and the 50 or 60 culvert dams are all newly built or newly repaired projects this year, and have not been tested by floods. Flood control organizations at all levels must be highly vigilant and rely on the masses to defend them closely. This year, the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued flood control instructions, calling on local leaders to be responsible for strengthening the pre-flood inspection work. For important projects, even those that are generally considered to be very safe, inspections should be carried out conscientiously. For the Runheji Diversion Sluice in the middle reaches and the reservoir project in the upper reaches, in particular, engineering personnel who participated in the construction and can assume considerable responsibility should be stationed for a long time so that they can be repaired immediately in the event of an accident. In addition, hydrological measurement work during the flood season is also very important. On the one hand, mastering water conditions is the primary condition for taking the initiative in flood control. On the other hand, measuring the flood in this year's flood season can also be used to correct past hydrological records and calculations, which is of great significance for determining future project plans.

　　Q: Please talk about your impressions of this inspection of the Huai River project.

　　A: I inspected the Huai River in April and May this year, and inspected all the projects from the mountainous area in the upper reaches to the tailwater entering the Yangtze River. What moved me the most were several things: First of all, after the land reform, the universal improvement of the peasants' political consciousness and their warm support for the Communist Party and the People's Government. This is not only the main condition for the rapid completion of the Huai River project, but also a favorable foundation for the vigorous development of all construction undertakings. The second is the strong leadership of the working cadres of the people's governments at all levels among the masses. Many administrative cadres have participated in this work since rescuing the flood disaster last year. Not only do they have a high prestige among the masses, but they have also become quite familiar with water conservancy business through long-term exploration. The third is the assistance of Soviet experts and the rapid progress of our scientific and technical personnel. Comrade Bukov, a Soviet expert from the Central Ministry of Water Resources, participated in the planning of the entire Huai River project, provided valuable opinions, and personally presided over the design of the Runheji Diversion Sluice. Chinese technical personnel recognized the greatness and importance of the Huai River project, and by accepting advanced Soviet experience, they have also made rapid progress. Finally, and most importantly, is Chairman Mao's great determination and brilliant leadership. Chairman Mao's determination has strengthened the people's belief in the Huai River basin to control the Huai River and overcome famine. Chairman Mao's determination has mobilized all relevant departments in the country to give the greatest support to the Huai River project. Chairman Mao's determination has made all the cadres and migrant workers participating in the Huai River project forget meals and sleep, and strive to improve efficiency and improve technology. Especially because of the long-term feudal rule, there have always been irreconcilable conflicts of interest between the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River basin. However, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the upper, middle, and lower reaches cooperated closely, and all the problems that were difficult to solve in history have now been solved easily. All of this is inextricably linked to the successful completion of the first phase of the Huai River project and the continued progress of future work.

### 就治淮第一期工程及淮河防汛问题水利部傅作义部长答记者问

　　就治淮第一期工程及淮河防汛问题水利部傅作义部长答记者问
    【新华社十八日讯】今年治淮工程中的关键性的工程，控制淮河干流洪水的润河集分水闸工程，可望于本月二十日全部完工，至此，第一期治淮工程即告完成。现在淮河已入汛期，全部工程即将受到今年洪水的考验。新华社记者为此特就这一工程的情况和今年淮河防汛中应注意的问题，访问中央水利部傅作义部长。傅部长对记者的问题答复如下：
    问：治淮的第一期工程即将基本完成，请告这一期工程有那些主要收获和经验？第一期工程在整个根治淮河工程中的作用与地位如何？第一期工程的进行与完工，对于淮河两岸人民战胜灾患已经起的和将要起的效益如何？
    答：由于毛主席对于人民的热爱，治淮工程在一九五○年淮河流域发生水灾以后就立即开始进行。根据中央人民政府政务院的决定，在一九五一年便要避免再度发生这样严重的水灾，一九五一年春季便要能够保证麦收。当时有许多人抱着极大的怀疑，认为如此艰巨的任务，在这样短促的时间内是不可能完成的。但是因为各级人民政府的工作干部及全体民工的积极努力，和有关部门的大力配合，这一工程现在即将胜利地完成了。在工程进行当中，动员民工人数最多时达二百二十万人；为赶运粮食和工程所需的物料，只皖北一区即动员各种船只达八千三百十四艘，车辆七千四百三十八辆。参加组织动员、工程领导和查勘测量的行政和技术干部共三万人。这些组织工作和领导工作的经验，都是很宝贵的。尤其是建筑洪河上游的石漫滩水库和淮河中游润河集巨大的分水闸工程的成功，在目前我国还缺乏这类经验的情况下，对全国水利工程界更有很大的教育意义。
    治淮工程的计划是以防洪为主，结合着灌溉、航运等多目标的流域开发计划。周总理指示要在五年以内完全免除淮河的水患，现在估计，仅就防洪工程而言，时间可能稍为提早。今年完成的第一期工程，则是防洪工程中的一部分。当然，在这些工程的规划中已经照顾到将来举办灌溉和航运工程的需要。
    关于治淮工程的效益，可以分成几方面来说。首先就救灾方面来说，因为治淮工程在一九五○年大水之后立即开始，并且是用以工代赈的方式进行的，再配合上当地人民政府领导的生产救灾运动，淮河流域受灾的群众已经完全度过了灾荒，实现了中央人民政府“不许饿死一人”的号召。其次就保证麦收的任务来说，今年淮河流域的小麦已经全部丰收。其原因除去今年淮河流域春雨不十分大以外，主要的原因是去年秋季淮河流域各地都进行了排水抢种的工作，去年冬季和今年春季又进行了淮河支流的疏浚工程和部分地区的沟洫工程。至于对第一期工程的防洪效益的估计，在上中下游统筹兼顾的原则下，上游方面，主要是作蓄水工程，但完成全部蓄水库工程，需要较长的时间，同时为了照顾中下游，今年对于上游河道的整理也还不能放手进行，所以今夏如果遇到一九五○年同样的洪水时，河南的水灾可以减轻，但是问题还未得到基本的解决。中游皖北方面，今年的工程是蓄泄兼施。除去在霍邱城西湖一带蓄洪七十二亿多立方公尺以外，还做了些疏浚工程，估计可以做到“小雨免灾，大雨减灾”。如果遇到一九五○年同样的洪水，皖北颍河以东、浍河以西，以及淮河北岸的广大地区，淮河干河及支河的堤防可以保证不溃决。这带地区的内涝问题也已得到部分解决，可以保证麦、秋两收。蚌埠市区和淮南煤矿所在的区域也可保证遇一九五○年同样洪水时不致成灾。至于淮河南岸与山区之间的狭长地带，如遇特大洪水时，还须用以调节淮河干流水量；浍河以东的淮河北岸地区，由于淮河支流与这带地区的内水排泄问题，今年还没有完全解决，上两个地区如果遇到一九五○年同样的洪水，还可能发生灾害。不过由于上中游蓄水的关系，水灾一定可以减轻。下游方面，淮河洪水经过上中游的控制拦蓄以后，今年如遇一九五○年同样的洪水时，估计中渡（淮水出洪泽湖入高宝湖的口子）的最大流量，可不超过八千五百秒立方公尺，同时运河的堤防在今春已经大力整修过，故今夏苏北可以保证安全。不过，为了应付万一发生意料之外的恶劣情况，例如长江与淮河同时发生非常大的洪水，淮河受江水顶托（这是几十年不一遇的特殊情况）等，也可能开放里运河归海坝。
    问：目前淮河已届汛期，你认为那些问题是所有治淮工程人员和沿淮地区的人民应该特别注意的？
    答：今年淮河方面，已经成立了流域性的统一领导防汛工作的机构，以求统一掌握水情，并统一掌握管理沿河的蓄洪湖泊和涵闸工程。至于沿河堤防的防守，则仍由各省区负责，以加强地方行政机关对于防汛的领导。至于今年防汛应该注意的事情，我认为：第一，是淮河防御和调节洪水的设施比较复杂，非一般单纯筑堤防水的工程可比，所以上中下游紧密联系，统一掌握湖泊水闸的蓄泄操纵是最重要的事情。其次，沿河一千余公里的堤防，和五、六十处涵洞闸坝，都是今年新建或新加修整的工程，没有经过洪水考验，各级防汛组织必须高度警惕，依靠群众，严密防守。今年中央人民政府政务院发布防汛指示，号召各地首长负责加强汛前的检查工作，对于重要的工程，即使一般认为已很安全的，也要认真进行检查。中游润河集分水闸和上游水库工程，尤其要有曾经参加施工并能负相当责任的工程人员长期驻守，以便发生事故时能够立刻修整。另外，汛期内的水文测验工作也非常重要。一方面掌握水情是防汛工作中争取主动的首要条件。另一方面，测量今年汛期的洪水，还可用以校正过去水文的记录和推算，对于决定将来的工程计划，有很重要的意义。
    问：请谈谈你这次视察治淮工程的观感。
    答：我在今年四五月间到淮河视察，从上游山地到入江尾闾，考察了全部工程。最使我感动的有几件事情：首先是土地改革以后，农民政治觉悟的普遍提高，和他们对于共产党与人民政府的热烈拥护。这不但是治淮工程所以能够迅速完成的主要条件，同时也是一切建设事业蓬勃发展的有利基础。其次是各级人民政府工作干部在群众当中坚强无比的领导作用。许多行政干部从去年抢救水灾起就参加了这一工作，不但在群众中有很高的威信，并且经过长期摸索，对水利业务也相当熟悉。第三是苏联专家的协助和我国科学技术工作人员的迅速的进步。中央水利部苏联专家布可夫同志，曾参加全部治淮工程的规划工作，提供了宝贵的意见，并亲自主持了润河集分水闸的设计工作。我国技术人员认识到治淮工程的伟大与重要，并接受苏联先进的经验，也获得迅速的进步。最后和最重要的一点感想，是毛主席伟大的决心，和英明的领导。毛主席的决心，坚定了淮河流域人民治淮度荒的信念。毛主席的决心，动员起全国有关部门拿出最大的力量支援治淮工程。毛主席的决心，使全体参加治淮的干部民工，忘餐废寝，为提高效率改进技术而斗争。尤其是由于长期封建统治的结果，淮河流域上中下游从来存在着难以调解的利害的矛盾，但在毛主席的领导下，上中下游密切合作，一切历史上难以解决的问题现在都迎刃而解了。这一切，对于第一期治淮工程的胜利完成，和今后工作的继续前进，都是有分不开的关系的。
