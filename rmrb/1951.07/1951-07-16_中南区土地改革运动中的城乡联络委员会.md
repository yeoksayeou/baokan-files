　　In the land reform movement last winter and this spring, many cities in the Central South Region timely established and utilized the "Urban-Rural Liaison Committee" to correctly handle many issues concerning urban-rural relations in the land reform movement.

　　Experience has proven that the "Urban-Rural Liaison Committee" is essential in the land reform movement. First, many people living in cities own land in rural areas, including landlords, dual-status landlords, and small land renters. For example, more than 80% of industrialists and businesspeople in Wuhan and Changsha own land in rural areas. The duty of the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee is to mobilize them to voluntarily abide by the land reform laws of the People's Government and carry out rent reduction or land reform according to law. Second, some local bullies and unlawful landlords who originally lived in rural areas deliberately resisted land reform and hid in cities. The Urban-Rural Liaison Committee should resolutely support the peasants and force the unlawful landlords to return to their hometowns to await handling. Third, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee can introduce some poor people and unemployed workers who are willing to engage in agricultural production to go to the countryside to receive land. The Urban-Rural Liaison Committee in the Central South Region has made great achievements in this land reform movement.

　　The organization of the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee is jointly composed of relevant government departments (including public security, the Land Reform Committee, the court, industry and commerce, civil affairs, education, etc.), and people's organizations such as trade unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and peasant associations, with the participation of democratic parties and the united front departments of the Communist Party. The committee sets up an urban-rural liaison office as a daily administrative body. According to statistics, 135 cities in the Central South Region, including Hankou, Guangzhou, Changsha, and Nanchang, established Urban-Rural Liaison Committees in this land reform movement. Most of these Urban-Rural Liaison Committees were established between January and February this year. In the past six months, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committees in various cities have achieved many successes and accumulated experience in assisting the government in handling all issues concerning urban-rural relations in the land reform movement.

　　First, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee resolutely supported the just demands of the peasants and played a significant role in promoting the land reform movement. The Urban-Rural Liaison Committee can request public security organs to arrest unlawful landlords or local bullies hiding in cities who are reported by peasants according to law; assist peasants in completing various procedures in land reform with landlords or dual-status landlords who have lived in cities for a long time. The Urban-Rural Liaison Committee can also provide a lot of care for the lives of peasants entering the city, making peasants feel: "Coming to the city today is like visiting friends." In short, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee has played an active role in supporting the peasants' land reform movement, both politically and economically. The Wuhan Urban-Rural Liaison Office handled a total of 10,734 land reform-related cases in the four months from February to May. Among them, 3,394 cases involved the arrest of local bully landlords, bandits, and rural counter-revolutionaries, and 7,340 cases involved assisting peasants in completing procedures with landlords or dual-status landlords. The Chao'an County Urban-Rural Liaison Office in Guangdong Province assisted peasants in handling more than 1,500 rent reduction cases from its establishment on May 10 to June 3. In addition, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee's call for people from all walks of life in the city (including staff of government agencies and organizations) to declare the land they own in their hometowns has also greatly helped the land reform work.

　　Second, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee strictly protected the good order of the city and industry and commerce. While the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee publicized land reform to the urban people, calling on them to support the peasants, it also educated the peasants to cherish the people's cities. In this way, the rumors created by unlawful landlords and counter-revolutionaries against land reform were shattered, and the emotions of the urban people were stabilized. For example, the Wuhan Urban-Rural Liaison Committee made clear and specific provisions on the procedures that peasants should go through when entering the city to arrest people and the scope of the liquidation that peasants should conduct when entering the city, in accordance with policies. This ensured the order of the city and achieved a differentiated treatment of landlords, industrial and commercial dual-status landlords, and small land renters. For some industrialists and businesspeople who rented land in Huangpi, Xiaogan, and Xianning counties, the Wuhan Urban-Rural Liaison Office sent cadres and representatives of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and democratic figures to form a group, leading the industrialists and businesspeople to the countryside to specifically solve their land problems with the local peasants. This not only realized land reform but also protected industry and commerce from infringement, with very good results.

　　Third, the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee further consolidated the unity of the urban and rural people and strengthened the united front for the anti-feudal struggle of the urban and rural people. After the publicity of the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee, the urban people not only dispelled their wrong understandings and concerns about land reform but also further increased their hatred for the feudal landlord class, expressed sympathy and support for the peasants' just struggle, and put forward the slogan of not allowing the city to be a "bomb shelter" for the landlords. Residents of Gushi County in Henan Province took the initiative to monitor landlords when the county implemented land reform. As long as peasants came to the city to request a land issue to be settled with a certain landlord, the residents' group would immediately send the landlord to the Urban-Rural Liaison Office. Workers and urban poor people in various places were more active in supporting the peasants. They said, "Workers and peasants are one family, and we must serve the land reform." Therefore, they reported many local bully landlords hated by the peasants. Many people refused the bribery of the local bully landlords when reporting them.

　　The Urban-Rural Liaison Committee supported the peasants and thoroughly shattered the landlord class's illusion of using the people's cities as bomb shelters to stubbornly resist land reform. Before the establishment of the Urban-Rural Liaison Committees in various places, not only did the landlords and dual-status landlords residing in cities not go to the countryside, but also a large number of unlawful landlords and local bullies in the countryside hid in the cities. This prevented land reform from proceeding smoothly and being thoroughly realized. After the establishment of the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee and further publicity of the land reform policy, the urban people, led by the workers, warmly supported the peasants and shattered the landlord class's conspiracy. At the same time, most of the industrial and commercial figures who were also landlords dispelled their concerns and implemented the land reform law. However, some unlawful landlords even fantasized about using the Urban-Rural Liaison Office as a "protective amulet" to resist the peasants. They neither honestly implemented the land reform law in the Urban-Rural Liaison Office, resorting to all kinds of denials, nor refused to go to the countryside with the peasants. They said things like "It can only be resolved in the liaison office." In this way, the Urban-Rural Liaison Office not only exposed their conspiracy to resist land reform to people from all walks of life but also announced its agreement with the peasants' just demands and took them back to their hometowns for the peasant masses to carry out a reasoning struggle with them. Only after the Urban-Rural Liaison Committee took this resolute action did it break through all the tricks of the unlawful landlords to resist and delay. This is also an important experience in the work of the Urban-Rural Liaison Committees in various parts of the Central South. This experience shows that the Urban-Rural Liaison Office is not a simple liaison agency, not just doing some technical work, but shouldering the important political task of supporting the broad masses of peasants and thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants. The Urban-Rural Liaison Committee must closely cooperate with various urban agencies and organizations, and with all aspects, to fully mobilize people from all walks of life in the city to uniformly support the land reform movement, so that unlawful landlords, bullies, bandits, and counter-revolutionaries have nowhere to hide, in order to thoroughly realize land reform.

### 中南区土地改革运动中的城乡联络委员会

　　中南区土地改革运动中的城乡联络委员会
    （中南军政委员会土地改革委员会巡视检查处处长  陈洪新）
    中南区的许多城市，在去冬今春的土地改革运动中，曾适时地建立和运用“城乡联络委员会”的机构，正确地处理了许多土地改革运动中有关城乡关系的问题。
    经验证明，土地改革运动中，“城乡联络委员会”是必不可少的。第一，不少住在城市里的人们，在农村里占有土地，有地主，有兼地主，有小土地出租者。例如武汉、长沙两市的工商业者，百分之八十以上在农村中占有土地。城乡联络委员会的职责，就是动员他们自动遵守人民政府的土地改革法令，依法进行减租或实行土地改革。第二，有一些原住农村的恶霸分子和不法地主，蓄意抵抗土地改革，匿居城市。城乡联络委员会就应该坚决支持农民，迫令不法地主们回乡去听候处理。第三，城乡联络委员会可以介绍一些愿意进行农业生产的贫民和失业工人下乡分田。中南区的城乡联络委员会在这次土地改革运动中，工作成绩很大。
    城乡联络委员会的组织是由政府有关部门（包括公安、土地改革委员会、法院、工商、民政、教育等部门），和工会、工商联合会、农民协会等人民团体共同组成，并有各民主党派和共产党的统战部门参加。委员会下设立一个城乡联络处，作为日常办事机关。据统计，中南区这次土地改革运动中，成立城乡联络委员会的有汉口、广州、长沙、南昌等一百三十五个城市。这些城乡联络委员会，大多是在今年一、二月间成立的，半年来，各城市的城乡联络委员会在协助政府处理一切土地改革运动中有关城乡关系的问题上，都有许多成绩和经验。
    第一，城乡联络委员会坚决地支持了农民的正义要求，对土地改革运动起了很大的推动作用。城乡联络委员会可转请公安机关依法逮捕农民所检举的匿居城市的不法地主或恶霸分子；协助农民向一些久居城市的地主或兼地主清理土地改革中的各项手续。城乡联络委员会对于进城的农民的生活，也可予以很多照顾，使农民觉得：“今天进城来像是看朋友一样。”总之，城乡联络委员会对农民的土地改革运动，不论在政治上或经济上都起了积极的支持的作用。武汉市的城乡联络处在二月到五月四个月内，共处理了一万零七百三十四件有关土地改革的事件。其中属于逮捕恶霸地主、土匪和农村反革命分子者三千三百九十四件，属于协助农民向地主或兼地主清理手续者七千三百四十件。广东省潮安县的城乡联络处自五月十日成立到六月三日止，即协助农民处理了一千五百多件减租事件。此外，城乡联络委员会号召城市各阶层（包括机关团体的工作人员）申报其在乡占有的土地，对土地改革工作的帮助也很大。
    第二，城乡联络委员会严格地保护了城市的良好秩序和工商业。城乡联络委员会一面向城市人民宣传土地改革，号召声援农民，一面又向农民进行了爱护人民城市的教育。这样，便粉碎了不法地主和反革命分子对土地改革所造的谣言，安定了城市人民的情绪。例如：武汉市的城乡联络委员会对于农民进城捕人应经过的手续，和农民进城清算的范围，都按政策作了明确而具体的规定。这样，便保障了城市的秩序，作到了对于地主、工商业兼地主和小土地出租者的区别对待。对于一些在黄陂、孝感、咸宁三县出租有土地的工商业者，武汉市城乡联络处就派干部和工商联合会和民主人士的代表组成小组，带领工商业者下乡，去和当地农民专门解决他的土地问题。这样既实现了土地改革，又能保护工商业不受侵犯，效果很好。
    第三，城乡联络委员会进一步巩固了城乡人民的团结，加强了城乡人民反封建斗争的统一战线。经过城乡联络委员会的宣传之后，城市人民不只打消了对土地改革的错误认识和顾虑，并进一步增长了对封建地主阶级的仇恨，表示同情和支援农民的正义斗争，提出了不让城市给地主当“防空洞”的口号。河南省固始县县城居民在该县实行土地改革时，主动地起来监视地主。只要有农民进城要求与某一地主清理土地问题时，居民小组就马上把那个地主送交城乡联络处。各地的工人和城市贫民对支援农民更加积极。他们说：“工农是一家，要为土地改革服务”，因此，他们检举了很多农民所痛恨的恶霸地主。不少人在检举时，拒绝了恶霸地主的收买。
    城乡联络委员会支持农民，彻底地粉碎了地主阶级幻想利用人民城市作防空洞，来对土地改革进行顽抗的阴谋。各地城乡联络委员会成立前，不仅居住城市的地主和兼地主不下乡，农村中的不法地主、恶霸分子也大批躲进城来。这样就使土地改革不能顺利进行，彻底实现。城乡联络委员会成立，对土地改革政策作了进一步的宣传之后，以工人为首的城市人民热烈地支持了农民，粉碎了地主阶级的阴谋。同时，大多数兼地主的工、商界人士，也解除了顾虑，执行了土地改革法。但是，也有少数不法地主竟又幻想以城乡联络处当“护身符”，对抗农民。他们在城乡联络处既不老实地执行土地改革法，百般抵赖，又拒不随农民下乡。他们说出“只有在联络处才能解决”一类的话。这样，城乡联络处便一面向各界人民揭露他们抗拒土地改革的阴谋，一面宣布同意农民的正义要求，把他们带回乡去，由农民群众与他进行说理的斗争。城乡联络委员会采取这个坚决的处置之后，才击破了不法地主的一切硬抗软拖的花样。这也是中南各地城乡联络委员会工作中的一个重要的经验。这一经验说明：城乡联络处不是一个单纯的接头机关，不仅仅是作些技术性的工作，而是肩负着支援广大农民，彻底消灭封建残余的重要政治任务的。城乡联络委员会必须与城市各机关团体，与各个方面密切配合，充分发动城市中的各阶层人民一致支援土地改革运动，使不法地主、恶霸、土匪、反革命分子无藏身之所，以彻底实现土地改革。
