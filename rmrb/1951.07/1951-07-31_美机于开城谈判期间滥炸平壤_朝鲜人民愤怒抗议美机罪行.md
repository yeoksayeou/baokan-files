Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 30th: The Korean newspapers all published a report from the Korean Central News Agency on the 28th, reporting the Korean people's angry protest against the U.S. Air Force's systematic bombing of Pyongyang after the start of the Kaesong talks.

The report said that the deadly enemy of the Korean people, the American aggressors, are still indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean residents. Since the beginning of the ceasefire and armistice negotiations in Kaesong, the bombing of Pyongyang has become even more rampant. Between July 23rd and 28th, American planes took advantage of the cloudy weather to indiscriminately bomb and strafe residential areas and suburbs of Pyongyang. As a result, many homes were reduced to ruins, and hundreds of residents were killed or wounded, including many women, children, and the elderly.

On the three days of the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, the U.S. Air Force systematically bombed and strafed an area of Pyongyang, dropping many time bombs. Hundreds of families were left homeless. On the evening of the 25th, in addition to dropping time bombs, the U.S. Air Force also dropped many small bombs resembling children's toys, fountain pens, and boxes of cigarettes in Pyongyang. Many children were killed.

On the 26th, U.S. planes indiscriminately bombed residential areas of Pyongyang through the clouds, from morning until noon.

The report pointed out that these barbaric air raids conducted by the United States during the Kaesong talks have aroused the anger of all the Korean people.

    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜各报二十八日都发表朝鲜中央通讯社的消息，报道朝鲜人民愤怒抗议美国空军在开城谈判开始后有计划地轰炸平壤的情况。
    该消息说，朝鲜人民的死敌美国侵略者仍然在滥炸朝鲜和平居民。在开城停火与停战谈判开始后，对平壤的轰炸更加猖狂了。在七月二十三日至二十八日之间，美国飞机利用阴云密布的气候，滥肆轰炸并扫射平壤的居民区和市郊。因此，许多住宅变成了废墟，成百的居民被炸死或炸伤，其中有许多妇孺老弱。
    在二十三、二十四、二十五日三天中，美国空军有计划地轰炸、扫射平壤的一个地区，投了许多定时炸弹。数百个家庭无家可归。二十五日晚，美国空军在平壤除了投掷定时炸弹外，还投下了许多像儿童玩具、自来水笔和满盒纸烟的小炸弹。许多儿童被炸死。
    二十六日，美机隔着云层对平壤居民区滥肆轰炸，从早晨一直炸到中午。
    该消息指出：美国在开城谈判期间所进行的这些野蛮的空袭，已激起了朝鲜全体人民的愤怒。
