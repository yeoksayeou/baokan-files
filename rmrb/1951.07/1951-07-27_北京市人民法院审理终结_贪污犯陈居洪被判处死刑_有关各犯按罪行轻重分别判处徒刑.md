The Beijing Municipal People's Court Concludes Trial:
　  Embezzler Chen Juhong Sentenced to Death
　  Other Accomplices Sentenced to Imprisonment According to Severity of Crimes

[Our Newspaper] Following investigation and prosecution by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, the case of Chen Juhong, an on-the-job cadre who colluded with unscrupulous merchants in embezzlement and bribery, has been concluded by the Municipal People's Court and sentenced on the 12th of this month. Chen Juhong was sentenced to death, and other relevant criminals were sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes.

The defendant, Chen Juhong, was the secretary of the Secretariat Section of the Business Management Office of the Industry Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee. He joined the revolutionary work in the summer of 1949. Last winter, Zuo Zixiang, the director of the office, was dispatched to Tianjin to purchase military supplies for the department, with Chen Juhong accompanying him. After arriving in Tianjin at the end of November last year, Zuo Zixiang left his post without authorization and returned to his hometown, Renqiu County, Hebei Province, entrusting all procurement work to Chen Juhong. He also entrusted Chen Juhong with the office's Tianjin representative seal, his personal seal, and over 7.93 billion yuan in special military funds. Chen Juhong, deeply influenced by the old society, immediately left the Tianjin representative office and accommodation after Zuo Zixiang left Tianjin, moving into a large hotel, spending lavishly, and taking the opportunity to collude with unscrupulous merchants in embezzlement and bribery, and diverting special military funds for speculative business. Last December, Chen Juhong purchased a batch of steel from the person in charge of the Tianjin "Yuansheng Hardware Store," defendant Wang Meisheng, which had not yet formally opened for business, conspiring to pass off futures as spot goods. Wang Meisheng therefore obtained illegal profits of 44 million yuan, while Chen Juhong accepted a disguised bribe of more than 12 million yuan. At the same time, Chen Juhong was introduced to defendant Zhang Yuanji, the deputy manager of the Tianjin "American" Automobile Company. Afterwards, the two often danced and dined together, and Chen Juhong deposited 15 million yuan of military funds with Zhang Yuanji for arbitrary spending. Through Zhang Yuanji's connection, Chen Juhong diverted 93 million yuan of military funds to privately purchase a car for his own use, hiring a driver and driving to entertainment venues at any time; and retained 4.6 million yuan of the car dealership's tax for his own use. In order to obtain exorbitant profits, Chen Juhong and Zhang Yuanji signed a car sales cooperation agreement, engaging in speculative business. On the one hand, Chen Juhong declared to others that he had 35 eight-new jeeps urgently wanting to be shipped from Chongqing to Tianjin for sale; on the other hand, he diverted 10 million yuan of military funds to Zhang Yuanji as travel expenses, and Zhang Yuanji took a plane to Chongqing to handle the purchase of jeeps. Later, Zhang Yuanji impersonated the name of the Southwest Industry Department's Tianjin purchasing representative in Chongqing to apply for plane tickets, preparing to return to Tianjin.

After staying in his hometown for half a month, Zuo Zixiang returned to Tianjin in mid-December, but stayed at a relative's home due to illness and did not return to the Tianjin representative office and accommodation. He did not check or assess Chen Juhong's procurement work. During his recovery, Zuo Zixiang accepted 2.5 million yuan from Chen Juhong in the name of office expenses, which exceeded the statutory standard of supply that Zuo Zixiang should receive.

On January 15 of this year, Chen Juhong even left his post without authorization, taking a dancing girl from Tianjin to Beijing for sightseeing, using the pseudonym Chen Yuhong, falsely claiming to be a Shanghai hardware merchant, and staying at the Dong'an Hotel in Beijing. After the public security organs discovered Chen Juhong's true identity, they immediately arrested him and sent him to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate for investigation and handling. At this point, all of Chen Juhong's illegal and undisciplined behaviors were fully exposed. In just one month, Chen Juhong had diverted as much as 134 million yuan in special military funds. According to Chen's confession, all the defendants in the case were thoroughly investigated and confirmed by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, and the relevant agencies were requested to arrest and escort them to Beijing in accordance with the law.

The Beijing Municipal People's Court conducted a trial of the entire case based on the public prosecution by the Municipal People's Procuratorate. With conclusive evidence, all defendants confessed to their crimes. The Municipal People's Court sentenced each defendant according to the severity of their crimes as follows:

Chen Juhong, as an on-the-job cadre, abused his power to collude with unscrupulous merchants for personal gain and bribery to satisfy his personal corrupt life, causing serious losses to state property, was sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life.

Zuo Zixiang left his post without authorization, abandoned his responsibilities as head of procurement, condoned his direct subordinate's embezzlement and bribery, and accepted 2.5 million yuan in office expenses from Chen Juhong for his own use, exceeding the statutory supply standard; his serious dereliction of duty resulted in significant losses to state property, was sentenced to five years in prison and deprived of political rights for five years.

Wang Meisheng illegally operated without obtaining a business license, and colluded with on-the-job cadres to engage in bribery, obtaining exorbitant profits and causing significant losses to state property, was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for three years, and fined 44 million yuan.

Zhang Yuanji colluded with on-the-job cadres to divert public funds for speculative trading, seeking exorbitant profits, and impersonated the staff of the Tianjin purchasing representative office, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 20 million yuan.

　　北京市人民法院审理终结
　  贪污犯陈居洪被判处死刑
　  有关各犯按罪行轻重分别判处徒刑
    【本报讯】在职干部陈居洪利用职权勾结奸商贪污舞弊案，经北京市人民检察署侦查并提起公诉后，已由市人民法院审理终结，于本月十二日予以判决。陈居洪判处死刑，有关各犯按其罪行轻重分别判处徒刑。
    被告陈居洪是西南军政委员会工业部经理处秘书科秘书，一九四九年夏参加革命工作。该处处长左子祥去冬奉派赴天津为该部采购军工物资，率领陈居洪随行。左子祥于去年十一月底到天津后即擅离职守，返回原籍河北省任邱县，将采购工作全部交与陈居洪一手办理，并将该处驻天津代表公章、本人私章及军工专款七十九亿三千余万元也交与陈居洪掌管。陈居洪因受旧社会习染很深，自左子祥离天津后，陈即擅离该处驻天津代表办公及住宿处所，迁住大阔饭店，任意挥霍，更趁机利用职权与奸商勾结，贪污舞弊，并挪用军工专款偷营投机生意。去年十二月，陈居洪向天津市尚未正式开业的“源生五金行”负责人被告王梅生购买钢料一批，同谋以期货充作现货。王梅生因此获得非法利润四千四百万元，而陈居洪便接受其变相贿赂共一千二百余万元。同时，陈居洪又经人介绍与天津“美国”汽车行副经理被告张元吉认识。以后，二人经常一道跳舞吃喝，陈居洪并以兵工专款一千五百万元存放张元吉处任意花用。通过张元吉的牵引，陈居洪挪用兵工专款九千三百万元私买汽车一部自用，雇用司机一人，随时开车往来游乐场所；并将汽车行商税款四百六十万元留自用。为了获取暴利，陈居洪与张元吉订立了汽车买卖合作契约，偷营投机生意。陈居洪一面向人宣称有八成新吉普车三十五辆，急欲由重庆运天津销售；一面又挪用兵工专款一千万元给张元吉作旅费，张元吉即乘飞机到重庆办理购买吉普车手续。后来，张元吉在重庆又冒充西南工业部驻天津购料代表名义请购飞机票，准备返回天津。
    左子祥在原籍逗留半个月后，于十二月中旬回到天津，因患病住在亲戚家，并未回到驻天津代表办公及住宿处。对于陈居洪进行采购工作的情况，亦未加检查和考核。在养病期中，左子祥曾接受陈居洪以办公费为名送去的二百五十万元花用，此数超过左子祥应受供给的法定标准。
    今年一月十五日，陈居洪更擅离职守，携带舞女由天津到北京游逛，化名陈雨虹，伪报上海五金商人身份，住在北京东安旅社。公安机关查出陈居洪本来身份后，即将其拘捕送交北京市人民检察署侦查处理。至此，陈居洪所有违法乱纪行为全盘暴露。仅仅一个月内，陈居洪先后挪用军工专款即达一亿三千四百万元。根据陈犯所供，全案案犯亦经北京市人民检察署详细侦查确实，依法分请有关机关拘捕并押送来北京。
    北京市人民法院依据市人民检察署的公诉，对全案进行了审讯。各被告以证据确凿，均供认罪行不讳。市人民法院按各被告罪行轻重分别判决如下：
    陈居洪身为在职干部，利用职权勾结奸商营私舞弊以满足个人腐化生活，使国家财产遭受严重损失，判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    左子祥擅离职守，放弃采购主管职责，纵容直属干部贪污舞弊，并曾接受陈居洪送去的办公费二百五十万元花用，超过法定供给标准；其严重渎职结果，使国家财产遭受重大损失，判处徒刑五年，剥夺政治权利五年。
    王梅生在未领得营业执照时即非法营业，并勾串在职干部舞弊，获取暴利，使国家财产遭受重大损失，判处徒刑二年，缓刑三年，并科罚金四千四百万元。
    张元吉勾结在职干部挪用公款进行投机买卖，图谋暴利，并冒充驻天津购料代表办公处工作人员，判处徒刑三年，并科罚金二千万元。
