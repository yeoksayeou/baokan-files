Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

To the Editor:

　　The People's Daily published a letter from Comrade Han Xiu on July 11th criticizing our factory for carelessness in our work, resulting in serious waste. We should make a deep self-criticism regarding this.

　　I. We underestimated our factory's production capacity and should not have accepted such a large task in such a short period, and then subcontracted it to a private binding bureau.

　　II. We did not have a deep understanding of the work attitude and technical capabilities of the Tongjin Binding Bureau beforehand, nor did we provide good supervision and inspection afterwards.

　　III. Due to the above two errors, our factory suffered losses in labor and materials due to compensation.

　　IV. We accept this experience and lesson, and will never accept tasks that exceed our factory's production capacity in the future. We will never subcontract accepted tasks to external factories again.

　　In addition, some of the opinions raised by Comrade Han Xiu differ from the facts. After this error occurred, the factory management committee conducted an early self-criticism and decided to take full responsibility for compensating for the damaged parts. On June 2nd, we consulted with the person in charge of the General Cadre Management Department of the Military Commission and agreed to redo the work at the binding bureau they designated. Comrade Han Xiu believes that our factory did not pay enough attention to the contract, evaded responsibility, and said that we wanted him to accept unusable defective goods, etc., but the facts are not like that. Regarding the loss of more than 50 million yuan, we not only did not ask the Tongjin Binding Bureau to compensate, but also, in order to take care of the Tongjin Binding Bureau's expenses for workers, we paid the Tongjin Binding Bureau wages exceeding the original amount. The loss was about 30 million yuan, not 50 million yuan. In short, this loss should not have happened and was completely avoidable. We did not fulfill our responsibilities. In addition to conducting a thorough self-criticism, we would like to explain the specific situation here.

### 长城印刷厂对承印履历表发生浪费一事的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　长城印刷厂对承印履历表发生浪费一事的检讨编辑同志：
    七月十一日人民日报刊有韩修同志批评本厂工作马虎造成严重浪费的来信，我们对此应当作深刻的检讨。
    一、我们对本厂的生产能力估计不够，不应该在很短的时间内，接受这样大的任务，又转到私营装订局去做。
    二、对同进装订局的工作态度和技术情况，事前既没有深刻的了解，事后又未很好的督促与检查。
    三、由于以上两点错误，就造成了本厂赔偿工料之损失。
    四、我们接受这次的经验教训，以后对超过本厂生产能力的任务，决不接受。接受的任务，决不再转给外厂承做。
    另外，韩修同志所提出的意见，有些地方与事实有出入。此项错误发生后，本厂管理委员会早进行了检讨，并决定对损坏部分完全负责赔偿。六月二日与军委总干部管理部经办人商量好在他们指定的装订局补做。韩修同志认为我厂对合同不够重视，逃避责任，并说我们要他收下不能用的坏货等，事实还不是这样的。关于损失五千多万元的问题，我们不但没有让同进装订局赔偿，而且为了照顾同进装订局对工人的开支，我们以超过了原定数额的工资付给了同进装订局。损失约三千万元，不是五千万元。总之，这一损失是不应该的，完全可以避免的。我们没有尽到职责，除已切实进行检讨外，特将具体情况，在此一并说明。
          北京长城印刷厂管理委员会
