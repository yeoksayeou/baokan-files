　　What are the Basic Issues in Construction Work?
    The People's Daily points out that construction is impossible without correct engineering design. If we ask how to determine engineering design, different workers can offer understanding and opinions from their own positions. However, what the basic issues in construction work are is worth attention and deliberation. In my opinion, at least two issues are extremely important: one is basing decisions on policies and realistically relying on manpower and material resources to meet the requirements of the policies; the other is a comprehensively successful urban plan that coordinates with various engineering constructions. The former is the driving force and direction; the latter is an important means of ensuring effectiveness. Engineering design solves individual problems, but it cannot ensure the correctness of the direction, nor can it ensure the effectiveness. To do a good job in construction, paying attention to basic issues is extremely important. There are quite a few facts at home and abroad that can prove that without solving the above-mentioned basic problems, even the best-designed projects can become burdens due to not meeting development needs, and individual projects contradicting each other can cause enormous waste. In some of our work, we have indeed encountered difficulties and losses caused by insufficient attention to basic issues or a lack of appropriate methods, and in some work, sharp disputes have arisen due to the lack of proper coordination between different projects. These problems cannot be solved by individual engineering designs, because they have exceeded the technical scope and include a considerable degree of principle, and cannot be solved by seeking solutions from minor technical details. Basic problems must be solved fundamentally.
    It is undeniable that our construction workers, especially technical personnel, do not all have a high level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, nor do they all have rich work experience and technology. Not many people master both weapons in a balanced way. Among the existing workers, they often lean to one side or abandon the other. Empty political enthusiasm and principles cannot make projects a reality, and pure technology is unlikely to have satisfactory results. How to combine these two and guide attention to basic issues, I think, is as important as, or even more important than, engineering design. In order to ensure the role and effectiveness of engineering design in construction work, deeply and seriously paying attention to the basic issues in construction work is an important link in completing the construction task. Therefore, examining the difficulties and losses caused by ignoring basic issues and learning from experience; paying attention to some fundamental principles in basic issues from the leadership level and helping workers with lower levels analyze and study, thereby improving them; mobilizing the broad masses, especially workers who directly participate in construction work or closely related work, to pay attention to, study, and master the basic principles of construction work; I think is extremely important. It is able to further develop the correct call that "construction is impossible without correct engineering design."

　　什么是建设工作中的基本问题？
    人民日报指出，没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工。如果我们问怎样决定工程设计呢？不同的工作者可以从他自己的岗位上提出了解和看法。但是，什么是建设工作中的基本问题是值得重视和推敲的。就我的看法，至少有两个问题是极端重要的，一个是根据政策，实事求是的依据人力、物力条件，满足政策的要求；一个是配合各种工程建设而综合成功的都市计划。前者是动力、是方向；后者，则是保证效果的重要手段。工程设计是解决个别问题的，它既无法确保方向的正确，也不能确保效果的良好。为要做好建设工作，注意基本的问题是极端重要的。在国内外都有相当多的事实可以证明，不解决好上述的基本问题，设计得最好的工程会因不合发展需要而成赘物，各个的工程互相抵触会造成极大的浪费。在我们某些工作之中，确实地已经碰到了由于对基本问题重视不足或缺少恰当办法所引起的困难和损失，在某些工作之中，已因不同工程缺少正当的配合而引起尖锐的争执。这些问题决不是一个个的工程设计所能解决的，因为它已超出了技术性的范围，而包含了相当高度的原则性，不能从枝枝节节的技术之中寻求解决了，基本的问题要从基本解决。
    无庸讳言，我们的建设工作者，特别是技术人员，并不是个个都具有高度的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的水平，也并不是个个都具有丰富的工作经验和技术。均衡地掌握两重武器的人不是很多的。在现有的工作者之中，常是偏了这一边，或是废了那一边。空有政治热情和原则不能使工程实现，单纯的技术决不易有美满的效果。怎样结合这二者，并把注意力引导到基本问题上去，我以为比之工程设计是同等重要甚至更为重要的。为了确保工程设计在建设工作中的作用和效果，深入地、严肃地重视建设工作中的基本问题，是完成建设任务的重要环节。因之，检查因忽视基本问题而招致的困难和损失，吸取经验教训；从领导上重视基本问题中的一些根本原则，帮助水平不高的工作人员分析、研究，从而提高他们；发动广大的群众，特别是直接参加建设工作或密切关连的工作人员，重视、钻研、掌握建设工作中的基本原则；我认为是极端重要的。是能够更进一步的发展“没有正确的工程设计就不可能施工”的正确号召的。
