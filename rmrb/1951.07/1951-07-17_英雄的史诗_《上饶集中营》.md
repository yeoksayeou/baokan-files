　　An Epic of Heroes – "Shangrao Concentration Camp"
　　Zhou Wen
　　I was deeply moved after watching "Shangrao Concentration Camp," a film scripted by Comrade Feng Xuefeng and directed by Comrades Sha Meng and Zhang Ke. I borrowed the screenplay from the Film Bureau and read it repeatedly, unable to put it down. I believe this is a work worthy of being called an "epic of heroes." Although this work only depicts a corner of the great revolutionary struggle of our time, it profoundly reflects the great patriotism of the Communist Party and the patriotic people, and the vivid image of the growth of revolutionary heroism. It can be said that this work is a monument to the heroic struggle of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation against traitors and national betrayers.

　　This work depicts the following historical fact: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, after the Kuomintang reactionaries created the despicable and shameless Southern Anhui Incident, they imprisoned seven or eight hundred captured New Fourth Army cadres and two or three hundred arrested patriots in the Shangrao Concentration Camp. The enemy used all kinds of cruel tortures to torment them, kill them, and used all kinds of most shameless and insidious means to induce them to betray; all this was in vain. All these heroes, under the leadership of the Communist Party, were united as steel, and their will to fight was as firm as iron; many comrades faced the enemy's butcher knife without changing color and died generously, fully demonstrating their noble revolutionary integrity; those who did not die continued to carry forward the spirit of the martyrs, fought more bravely and calmly, and finally launched a great riot on the road when the enemy withdrew them to Fujian, seized the enemy's weapons to arm themselves, defeated the enemies escorting them, and won victory.

　　The unfolding of this story, scene after scene, is so thrilling and so admirable and moving. It ignites your anger against the enemy and, at the same time, inspires you by the heroism of the heroes. Their generous sacrifice makes you stand in awe, admire them endlessly, and yearn for their great benevolence, great wisdom, and great courage for the country and the people; their every victory makes you cheer for them. The more the story develops, the more serious the situation becomes, forcing you to feel difficulty in breathing; and the development of the heroes is even more united, stronger, and more like a giant, which makes your heart blossom. Their fate, their every action, makes your heart follow closely, thus linking you with them. This is the power of this work.

　　Where does the power of this work lie? I think the most central thing is that the author successfully expressed the great role of the leadership of the Communist Party and showed the brilliant collective heroism.

　　The concentration camp is the "Pavilion of Wind and Waves" used by traitors and national betrayers to eliminate anti-Japanese heroes. For revolutionary fighters, where there is an enemy, there is a battlefield, but this is the most difficult battlefield, a battlefield where short weapons meet and fight with flesh and blood, and the struggle is the sharpest. Without the leadership of the Party, if the leadership of the Party is not strong enough, if it is impossible to give full play to a high degree of collective heroism, it is simply impossible to defeat the enemy spiritually, or even factually. And fighting on this battlefield is precisely such a force: its main force is the cadres of the New Fourth Army – these are all heroes who have been tempered in countless battles – they are all united under the leadership of the entire Party and the entire branch, and form a strong whole – this is a whole armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, organized and disciplined. Under such strong Party leadership, everyone consciously unites all the other inmates, all the patriots, closely around the Party, thus forming a larger collective, and thus forming a great, indivisible, and invincible force. This is the most important feature of the unfolding of this epic. The author firmly grasps this feature, like a red thread running through the entire story. You see, in that picture, the scene of celebrating the new acting commander of the New Fourth Army with a song regardless of the enemy's punishment; the scene of using cartoons and slogans to expose the enemy and unite oneself in order to counter the traitorous fallacies of the special agent instructor; the scene of unanimously tearing up the "Repentance Letters" issued by the enemy under the leadership of the Party leaders; the scene of unanimously shouting "Long live the Communist Party" on the playground to counter the enemy's reactionary slogans; after all the enemy's shameless tricks were forced to go bankrupt, the enemy used poisonous torture, but everyone generously rushed to the scene; the scene of the prisoners singing "Glory to You" for the comrades who were bravely and unyieldingly imprisoned in the barbed wire cage; the scene of exposing the enemy's fake "Anti-Communist Declaration" of Qian Ziying; the scene of unanimously mourning the martyrs and swearing an oath; and the scene of the final victorious great riot; all this fully demonstrates the great leadership role of the Party and demonstrates a high degree of collective heroism. The unity of patriotic people, such as the help and education to the elementary school teacher Su Lin, the support for the righteous resistance of Professor Zhou Zhiheng, the sacrifice of Li Hua to save the peasant Zhang Sifu from being beaten to death, are all very moving scenes. All the patriotic people, under this influence, have become increasingly strong and completely consistent with the spirit of the Party, such as the scene of Su Lin and Shi Zhen sacrificing heroically together, such as the scene of an anti-Japanese military dependent (old woman) blocking the car at the risk of sacrifice to scold the enemy for the brutal killing of female comrades, are also very moving. These also best illustrate the great role of the Party's leadership and the promotion of collective heroism. All the struggles, all the sacrifices, all the victories here are collectivist, and some individual activities are for the collective, and are the concretization of the Party's will and the class's will. It is not like some works that abstractly talk about the Party's leadership, or think that the appearance of a person representing the Party to talk about the Party's instructions is considered to be the expression of the Party's leadership, or that it is the expression of the Party's leadership. Such understanding is too simple. The reason why this work successfully expresses the Party's leadership lies in the fact that it completely concretizes the Party's role and completely embodies it in all actions, so that people can see the radiance of the Party's thought everywhere, as if you can touch it with your finger, it makes you burst into tears of gratitude for the strength and success of this leadership, and receive profound education.

　　Of course, this is a work of art, not a paper, nor a report. The reason why the author successfully expressed the Party's leadership, expressed collective heroism, and gave people a deep impression, is mainly because the author successfully created several outstanding heroic characters. Yes, the characters described by the author are particularly outstanding, vivid, and profound; but the author did not make them stand out above the collective, on the contrary, they all appear, think, and act as a member of the collective. Such heroes are truly collective heroes under the ideological leadership of the Party. The more such characters are written with flesh and blood, the more the expression of the Party's leadership and collective heroism will appear with flesh and blood. Now, let's pay tribute to these few outstanding heroic figures:

　　First of all, let's look at the model of the leader with the demeanor of a great politician – Zhao Hong. The author has expressed such a model so successfully, I have seen it for the first time in our Chinese works. This hero has the following characteristics: calm, composed, wise, and down-to-earth. He leads the whole without revealing his sharp edge, analyzes the situation calmly in everything, determines the direction, and is always firm and correct. Even when the enemy discovered that he was Qian Ziying, the organization minister of the political department of the New Fourth Army, and induced him to betray, he was still so calm, so composed, and fought with the enemy righteously. In front of the beasts, he was so calm and composed, "frowning at the thousand pointing fingers," truly as calm and great as Mount Tai. Even when the enemy fabricated his "anti-Communist declaration" and provocatively told him that people were scolding him as a traitor, he was still able to analyze clearly and see that his passage was beneficial. He said: "Comrades will distinguish clearly. If you believe it, oh, comrades, that is your mistake, you have been poisoned by the enemy's trick. Oh, you scolded correctly, traitor, if someone really issued such a declaration, is that not a traitor to the Party, a traitor to the people, a traitor to the motherland? You should beat him to death alive. If you really believe that this shameless declaration was issued by this person, you should scold him as a traitor, yes, traitor, traitor, oh, most importantly, don't be influenced by such a traitor." How vividly this shows the great mind of a great politician who is not afraid of danger, who considers the Party, the country, the people, and the comrades from many aspects, and is still open-minded despite being slandered. From this point alone, you can see the characteristics of this hero. I think the creation of this kind of model is of great significance.

　　Another hero in the author's pen – Li Hua, is such a person: strong, brave, shrewd, and as passionate as fire. He encourages suffering comrades and supports suffering inmates; he denounces the enemy and saves innocent peasant inmates from being beaten to death at the cost of his own sacrifice; he despises the enemy's threat of being buried alive, and still says "I have nothing to say" when the soil is about to fill his head; he is not afraid of any torture from the enemy, and the image in that barbed wire cage reminds you of Prometheus chained to the rocks. (Note)

　　The author also wrote about Zhao Hong's best successor – Lv Gong. This is also a leader who is equally calm, strong, and has the courage. This character is written more simply than the previous two, but those characteristics are also well expressed before and after he led the victorious riot. It's just that the impression it gives people is not as profound as the previous two.

　　The author also created two heroines. One is Shi Zhen, who was raised and educated in the New Fourth Army, a young, pure, enthusiastic, and determined idealist. She will never shed a tear in front of the enemy, and she hates them so much that she won't even turn her eyes away. She is full of infinite love for the Party and comrades. She thinks a lot: she said that she had thought of committing suicide more than ten times, but when she thought that she was only seventeen years old, that the Japanese devils had not yet been driven out, that her revenge had not yet been avenged, that she thought of work, of the Party, of Chairman Mao, of her beloved comrades, of the freedom of the motherland, of the happy days in the future, she hoped that one day she would be able to go out, and endured the unbearable humiliation. Finally, when the enemy pushed her off the cliff into the deep pool, she still floated a smile for her ideals. She is always revolutionarily optimistic.

　　The other is Su Lin, a naive, pure, and progressive patriotic youth. She once thought that her arrest and suffering were so unjust. When she saw the dead, she wondered if the reactionaries could achieve their goal by doing this? She was still naive enough to treat the enemy as human beings. But under the help and influence of her comrades, she learned a lot. She tore up the "Repentance Letter" with everyone, she became brave, and was determined to endure the enemy's poisonous torture. She felt that it was a blessing to sacrifice with Shi Zhen. When she was about to jump into the deep pool, she said: "Although I am not a Communist Party member, let me shout, Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!"

　　These characters have different characteristics and different personalities, leaving behind different relief-like images. And these characters also have common characteristics, that is, they are all thoughtful and strong revolutionary heroes. Their personalities and their thoughts are so organically unified that their images are very natural and vivid, so it gives people a deep impression and a kind of cordial feeling, feeling that the faces of these characters are so familiar to us in the daily life of the revolutionary ranks, and yet make people feel like poetry. Yes, they are all beautiful, you will naturally love them, you will not be able to help but shout: Oh! What a beautiful image! The author has thus combined personality and thought, combat life and poetry. Here, through these heroic images, the author fully praised the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, fully praised the noble qualities of class fighters and patriotic people, fully praised the great patriotism and noble revolutionary integrity, and fully praised the great victory of the Party's leadership and collective heroism. The author thus tells the audience that the Communist Party is great, the continuous progress of patriotic people is great, our Chinese people are so great, and his task is to praise these great things, and these great things are precisely the new and beautiful reality of our time. The author truly fulfilled the best duty of revolutionary realism.

　　Of course, we should see that the great revolutionary heroism that the author praises is expressed against the background of the darkest, most terrifying, and bloodiest background. That is to say, the concentration camp is a place that eats people, and even timid people will bristle when they hear the name. Without true insight and correct reflection, it would be frightening to write. The reason why this work is good is that the revolutionary heroism in the author's pen is overwhelming, so that people can see that the greatness of this revolutionary heroism, like the Himalayas, stands巍巍然 in the world, so that all the enemy's cruelty, terror, and insidiousness are like some reptiles, and they are all the more incomparably despicable, ugly, and small. To see heroism from terror, to see bones from hardship, to see light from darkness, this is the true skill of a revolutionary artist. Some authors write about the enemy's terror as if all are shrouded in ox-headed horse faces, mountains of knives and seas of fire, making people only feel terror, even if they also express the people, but they are powerless in the face of terror. If this is also called "reality," it is one-sided, exaggerated, and violates revolutionary realism. It lacks a true understanding of social development and a true understanding of revolutionary forces, so it unknowingly helps the enemy to scare itself objectively. This work is the opposite. The author also wrote about the enemy's terror, and wrote a lot, but the author used an extremely hateful, contemptuous, and disdainful attitude to write about it. All that cruelty, terror, and insidiousness are just foils for revolutionary heroism. Lu Xun's poem has "Frowning at the thousand pointing fingers," there must be "thousand pointing fingers," and there must be "frowning at the thousand pointing fingers," and this "frowning at the thousand pointing fingers" is the expression of the spine of history. This is correct, this is truly real, and this is reality. Especially today, social development has reached the century of the people. The terror of the reactionary class, along with its class, is something that is declining, something that is dying, while the revolutionary heroism of the revolutionary people is like the rising sun, something that is newly born, something that is full of vitality, and is the newest and most beautiful reality of our time. Because the author appropriately expressed it, it makes you only arouse people's greatest and deepest hatred for the enemy, and arouse people's cheers for the forces of light, and enhance the conviction of inevitable victory. The so-called "strengthening one's own ambition and destroying the enemy's prestige," its great educational significance lies in this. The author's handling is very correct.

　　Overall, I think this is a work with a high degree of ideological content and a high degree of artistry. It is worth learning from.

　　Of course, this is a movie, and its success is also due to the valuable efforts of the directors and actors. From the entire film, it can be seen that the directors and actors truly understand the thought of this work, understand the characteristics of the characters, and understand the scale of the story's development, so the performance and production are very mature. Especially those characters, those heroes, are so natural, so vivid, they are really like our Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, very simple, very much like them, and those patriotic people are also very much like them, without feeling forced, and without that pretentious "acting," so it makes us feel more cordial. I think this is a great success for the directors and actors, and a new achievement in film art.

　　Of course, if you want to find shortcomings, you can also find some, such as the differences between the several prisons, which are not easy to distinguish; the small special agents mixed among the prisoners are not easy to distinguish; the scene of the enemy forcing people to shout reactionary slogans cannot make people clearly see that a few small special agents are following the shouting, and misunderstandings may occur. When the prisoners bravely fought back and shouted "Long live the Communist Party," there was also a lack of close-ups, so it could not be more moving. I have only seen one movie, and now I only remember these, and maybe there are other things worth discussing, but I can't remember. Overall, this review, I only focused on some major issues to talk about, and I don't plan to talk about some other issues, or even some minor shortcomings in the original work. As for the art of film, I am even more of a layman, so omissions, or even inappropriate things, are inevitable, and please correct me.

　　Finally, I have a small suggestion: because the prisoners talk mostly in secret, mostly in a low voice, which is reasonable; but therefore some words are not heard clearly, so you can't fully understand its meaning, which is a pity. In order to remedy this, can you add some subtitles to those low-voiced conversations? I think that if the audience can understand every sentence, it will have a greater educational effect.

　　Note: In Greek mythology, Prometheus resisted the god Zeus, stole fire from the sky, and passed it on to mankind. Zeus, who wanted to destroy mankind, chained him to the barren rocks of the cliff, and he never succumbed.

　　英雄的史诗——《上饶集中营》
    周文
    冯雪峰同志编剧、沙蒙、张客等同志导演的《上饶集中营》，我看了后，很感动。又从电影局借来镜头剧本，反复阅读，爱不释手。我认为这是够得上称为“英雄的史诗”的作品。这作品，虽然只是写了我们这时代伟大革命斗争中的一角，但却是深刻反映了共产党和爱国人民的伟大爱国主义精神，和革命英雄主义成长的生动形象。可以说，这作品是我们中华民族的优秀儿女在反抗汉奸卖国贼的英勇斗争中的一块纪念碑。
    这作品，是描写这样一段历史事实：在抗日战争时期，国民党反动派制造了卑鄙无耻的皖南事变后，把我被俘的新四军干部七、八百人，和被捕的爱国人士二、三百人，一起囚在上饶集中营。敌人用了各种残酷刑罚来折磨他们，杀害他们，用了各种最无耻的阴险手段来诱迫他们叛变；这一切都是徒劳的。这所有的英雄们，在共产党的领导之下，团结如钢，斗争意志如铁；许多同志在敌人的屠刀下毫不变色，慷慨就义，充分表现了崇高的革命气节；未死者则继续发扬先烈精神，更加英勇而沉着地战斗，在敌人把他们撤到福建的路上，终于举行了伟大的暴动，夺取了敌人的武装来武装了自己，打垮了押解他们的敌人，获得了胜利。
    这故事的展开，一幕紧接一幕，都是那样惊心动魄，那样可歌可泣。它使你燃烧起对敌人的怒火，同时，又使你为英雄们的壮烈所鼓舞。他们的慷慨就义，使你为之肃然起敬，为之咏叹不置，神往于他们为国为民的大仁、大智、大勇；他们的每一胜利，又使你为之欢呼。这故事越发展，情况越严重，迫使你呼吸都感到困难；而英雄们的发展，则是更团结，更坚强，更像一个巨人一样，这又使你为之心花怒放。他们的命运，他们的每一行动，都使你的心紧紧跟随着，因而使你和他们联在一起了。这就是这作品的力量。
    这作品的力量何在呢？我认为最中心的，是作者成功地表现了共产党领导的伟大作用，表现了辉煌的集体英雄主义。
    集中营，这是汉奸卖国贼用来消灭抗日英雄的“风波亭”。对于革命战士说来，那里有敌人，那里就是战场，然而这却是个最困难的战场，是短兵相接、用血肉来搏斗的战场，斗争是最尖锐不过的。如果没有党的领导，如果党的领导不够坚强，如果不能发挥高度的集体英雄主义，要想在精神上战胜敌人，乃至在事实上战胜敌人，那简直是不可能的。而在这个战场上作战的，恰恰就是这样的部队：它的主力军是新四军的干部——这都是些身经无数战斗百炼成钢的英雄——他们都团结在整个党、整个支部的领导之下，而形成为一个坚强的整体——这是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装了的、有组织、有纪律的整体。在这样坚强的党的领导之下，人人都自觉地把所有难友，把所有爱国人士紧紧地团结在党的周围，因而形成了一个更大的集体，也就形成了一个伟大的、不可分解、不可战胜的力量。这就是这个史诗展开的最主要的特点。作者紧紧抓住这个特点，像一条红线似地贯穿了整个故事。你看，在那画面上，为了新四军有了代军长，不顾敌人的惩罚而全体高歌庆贺的场面；为了反击特务教官的汉奸谬论，而用漫画、标语来揭破敌人、团结自己的场面；在党的领导者带头之下，全体一致撕毁敌人所发的《悔过书》的场面；在操场上全体一致高呼共产党万岁来反击敌人反动口号的场面；在着着迫使敌人的无耻伎俩都破产了以后，敌人施用毒刑，但个个都慷慨以赴的场面；囚徒们为英勇不屈的被关进铁刺站笼的同志高歌“光荣归于你”的场面；揭破了敌人假造钱子英的“反共宣言”的场面；全体追悼牺牲者而宣誓的场面；以及最后举行胜利的伟大暴动的场面；这一切，都充分表现了党的伟大领导作用，表现了高度的集体英雄主义。其团结爱国人士，如像对小学教员苏琳的帮助和教育，对教授周志恒的正义的抗争的支持，对农民张四富、为使他免于被打死、李华挺身出来自我牺牲地承当敌人打击等场面，都是非常动人的。所有爱国人士，在这种影响之下，都表现日益坚强，和党的精神完全一致，如像苏琳和施珍一道英勇牺牲的场面，如像一个抗日军属（老太婆）不顾牺牲拦车痛骂敌人残杀女同志的场面，同样都是非常动人的。这些，也都最好地说明党的领导的伟大作用，和集体英雄主义的高扬。这里的一切斗争，一切牺牲，一切胜利，都是集体主义的，个人的某些活动，都是为了集体，都是党的意志、阶级的意志的具体化。它不像有些作品那样，抽象地讲党的领导，或者以为出现一个人代表党讲一通党的指示，就算是表现了党的领导，或者就才是表现了党的领导。这样的了解，是太简单了。这作品表现党的领导之所以成功，就在于它把党的作用完全具体化，完全体现在一切行动中，因此也就使人处处看见了光芒万丈的党的思想的光辉，仿佛你伸出指头就可以摸得着的，它使你为这领导的坚强和成功而油然迸出感激的泪水，而受到深刻的教育。
    当然，这是一个艺术作品，不是一篇论文，也不是一个报告。作者之所以成功地表现了党的领导，表现了集体英雄主义，而且给人的印象很深，主要还是由于作者成功地创造了几个特出的英雄人物。是的，作者描写的几个人物是特别突出的，生动的，深刻的；但是作者又并没有使他们突出于集体之上，相反，他们倒都是以集体的一分子而出现，而思想，而行动的。这样的英雄，也才真是党的思想领导下的集体主义的英雄。这样的人物越写得有血有肉，则党的领导、集体英雄主义的表现，也就越加显得有血有肉了。现在，我们就来瞻仰一下这几个特出的英雄人物吧：
    首先，我们来看那位有大政治家风度的领袖人物的典型——赵宏。这样的典型，作者表现得那样成功，我在我们中国的作品里还是第一次看见。这位英雄具有这样的特点：镇定、沉着、明智而踏实。他不露锋芒地领导了全体，遇事都是冷静地分析情况，确定方针，始终是坚定的，正确的。就是当敌人发现他是新四军政治部的组织部长钱子英，诱迫他叛变的时候，他仍然是那么沉着，那么镇定，辞严义正地和敌人斗争，在野兽们面前，那样泰然自若，“横眉冷对”，真像泰山一样镇定和伟大。甚至当敌人假造了他的“反共宣言”，并挑拨地告诉他人们骂他是叛徒的时候，他仍然能够明澈地分析，看看他的那段话是有好处的，他说：“同志们会辨明的。要是你们相信，呵，同志们，那是你们的错误，你们中了敌人的毒计。呵，你们骂得对，叛徒，如果有一个人真发了这样的宣言，那还不是党的叛徒，人民的叛徒，祖国的叛徒吗？你们该活活打死他。如果你们真相信这个无耻宣言是这个人发的，你们就该骂他是叛徒，对，叛徒，叛徒，哦，最要紧的，不要受这样的叛徒的影响。”这多么地活现出一个大政治家的临难不苟，为党、为国、为人民、为同志们、从多方面设想、虽身背诬蔑而仍然豁达的伟大心境。仅从这一点，就可以看出这英雄的特色了。我认为这种典型的创造是有极大意义的。
    作者笔下的另一位英雄——李华，则又是这样一个人物：坚强、勇敢、精明而火一样热烈。他鼓励受难的同志，支持受难的难友；他痛斥敌人，以自我的牺牲来拯救无故被捕的农民难友免于打死；他蔑视敌人活埋的威胁，土快填到头部仍然是“我没有什么可说的”；他不怕敌人的任何折磨，在那铁刺站笼里的面影，使你想起被锁在岩石上的普洛米修斯。（注）
    作者还写了赵宏的最好承继者——吕功。这也是一位同样沉着、坚强而有魄力的领袖人物。这个人物比前两个写得较简单一些，但是在他领导举行胜利的暴动前后，那些特点是也都表现得好的。只是给人的印象不及前两者深刻罢了。
    作者还创造了两位女英雄。一位是施珍，是在新四军被教养大的、年青、纯洁、热情而有坚定理想的人物。她决不在敌人面前流一滴眼泪，仇恨到连眼珠子也不转过去。对党、对同志们则充满着无限热爱。她想得很多：她说她曾经不止十次想自杀，但是想到自己才十七岁，想到日本鬼子还没有打出去，想到自己的仇还没有报，想到工作，想到党，想到毛主席，想到亲爱的同志们，想到祖国的自由，想到将来幸福的日子，她希望终有一天能够出去，而忍受着不能忍受的屈辱。最后，当敌人从崖上推她下深潭的时候，她仍为自己的理想而浮上了微笑。她始终是革命乐观主义的。
    另一位是苏琳，是天真、纯洁、追求进步的爱国青年。她曾经以为她的被捕受罪是多么冤枉。她看见了死人的时候，认为反动派这样做难道会达到目的吗？她还天真到把敌人当人看待。但是在同志们的帮助和影响之下，她知道了许多，学得了许多。她跟着大家一起撕掉《悔过书》，她变得勇敢，决心承受了敌人的毒刑。她感到和施珍一道牺牲是幸福的，她在要跳下深潭的时候说：“我虽不是共产党员，也让我喊吧，共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    这几个人物，具有不同的特点，不同的性格，留下了浮雕似的不同的面影。而这几个人物又有着共同的特点，那就是都是有思想的、坚强的革命英雄。他们的性格和他们的思想是那么有机地统一的，因此他们的形象也就是很自然的，活生生的，因而它就给人以深刻的印象和亲切的实感，觉得这些人物的面影，都是我们在革命队伍的日常生活中所见的那么熟悉，而又使人感到诗一样的美丽。是的，都是美丽的，你会很自然地爱他们，你会情不自禁地喊出：呵！多么美丽的形象呵！作者就是这么把性格与思想、战斗生活与诗揉合在一起了。作者在这里通过了这些英雄形象，尽情歌颂了中华民族的优秀儿女，尽情歌颂了阶级战士和爱国人士的高贵品质，尽情歌颂了伟大的爱国主义和崇高的革命气节，尽情歌颂了党的领导和集体英雄主义的伟大胜利。作者就是这样告诉观众，共产党是伟大的，爱国人士不断进步是伟大的，我们中国人民就是这样伟大的，他的任务就是歌颂这些伟大的，赞扬这些伟大的，这些伟大的就正是我们这时代新的美的现实。作者真正尽了革命的现实主义最好的职责。
    当然，我们应当看见，作者所歌颂的这种伟大的革命英雄主义，是在最黑暗、最恐怖、充满了血腥的背景之前表现出来的。就是说，集中营，那是吃人的地方，胆小的人听见了这个名字都会毛发倒竖的。如果没有真知灼见，不能正确反映，就会写得吓人。这作品之所以好，就在于作者笔下的革命英雄主义是压倒一切的，因而使人看见的，这种革命英雄主义的伟大，就像喜马拉雅山似的巍巍然屹立在世界上，这样，敌人的一切残酷、恐怖、阴险，就都像一些爬虫，越加显得无比的卑鄙、丑恶和渺小了。从恐怖中看出英勇，从艰苦中看出骨头，从黑暗中看出光明，这才是革命的艺术家的真正本领。有些作者一写敌人的恐怖，就仿佛牛头马面、刀山油锅笼罩了一切，叫人只感到恐怖，即使也表现人民，但却在恐怖之前无力，如果这也叫做“现实”，那是片面的，夸张了的，是违反革命现实主义的，是对社会发展缺乏真正了解，是对革命力量缺乏真正认识，因而不知不觉客观上帮助敌人吓了自己。这个作品就与此相反。作者也写了敌人的恐怖，而且写得不少，但作者是用了极大的仇视、蔑视、鄙视的态度去写它的，那一切残酷、恐怖、阴险，都不过是革命英雄主义的反衬。鲁迅的诗有“横眉冷对千夫指”，有“千夫指”，必须有“横眉冷对”，而且这种“横眉冷对”是作为历史的脊梁的表现。这样，才是正确的，才是真正真实的，也才是现实的。特别是在今天，社会的发展已经到了人民世纪，反动阶级的恐怖，和它的阶级一起，是没落的东西，是在死亡下去的东西，而革命人民的革命英雄主义，则是如日之东升，是新生的东西，是富有生命力的东西，是我们这时代最新最美的现实。由于作者恰当表现了它，使你看了，只有激起人对敌人最大最深刻的仇恨，和引起人对光明力量的欢呼，而增强了必然胜利的确信。所谓“长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风”，其巨大的教育意义也正在此。作者的这种处理方法是很正确的。
    整个说来，我认为这是有高度思想性，同时又有高度艺术性的作品，是值得我们很好学习的。
    当然，这是一个电影片子，它的成功，也还由于导演和演员们的可贵努力。从整个片子，可以看出导演和演员们真正体会了这作品的思想，体会了人物的特性，体会了故事发展的规模，因而在表演和摄制方面是很成熟的。特别是那些人物，那些英雄，表现得那么自然，那么鲜明，真是像我们共产党、解放军的人员那样，非常朴质，像极了，那些爱国人士也很像，毫不感到勉强，没有那种装腔作势的“做戏”，因而也就使我们感到更加亲切。我认为这是导演和演员同志们很大的成功，是电影艺术的新成就。
    自然，要找缺点，也可以找到一些的，比如几个监狱的不同，不容易使人分辨清楚；小特务混在囚徒中不容易使人分别；敌人强迫喊反动口号的场面，不能使人清楚看出是几个小特务在跟着喊，可能发生误会，囚徒们的英勇反击、喊共产党万岁的时候，也缺少特写，而不能更加动人。我只看过一场电影，现在就只记得这一些，也许还有值得提出来商讨之处，但是想不起来了。整个说来，这篇评论，我只是抓住一些主要问题来谈，其他一些问题，甚至原作里的某些小缺点，不打算谈了。至于对电影艺术说来，我更是外行，因此，挂一漏万，甚至不妥当之处，是在所难免的，还请读者指正。
    最后，我有一个小小提议：因为囚徒们谈话多是秘密的，多是压低嗓子，这是合理的；但是因此有些话听不太清，就不能完全了解它的意义，这是可惜的。为了补救这一点，可否把那些低声谈话之处加一些字幕？我想，如果使观众能够了解每一句话，那是有更大的教育作用的。
    注：希腊神话，普洛米修斯反抗天神宙斯，从天上窃取了火，传给人间，那想绝灭人类的宙斯就把他用铁链锁在悬崖的荒石上，他始终不屈服。
