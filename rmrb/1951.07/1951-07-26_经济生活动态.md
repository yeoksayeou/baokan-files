　　National New Record for Continuous Steelmaking in Open Hearth Furnace
　　An open hearth furnace in a Shanghai steel company factory, as of July 21st, has continuously and safely smelted 455 heats of steel, setting a new national record. The quality of carbon steel ingots produced by this furnace reached 99%. When the patriotic increase production and donation movement was launched in early June, the furnace age had already reached 300 heats. However, inspired by the call to donate weapons, the workers of the furnace believed that "smelting one more heat of steel is one more contribution to the victory of the Volunteer Army." Therefore, the requirement to extend the life of the open hearth furnace was included in the patriotic pact. When the furnace age reached 400 heats, the workers of the furnace wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to "extend the furnace age to 450 heats." Now, this guarantee has been overfulfilled. The main reason for the extended life of the open hearth furnace is the strengthened connection between the various departments related to the furnace's production and between the various work teams of the furnace, and the continuous improvement of operating methods. They have found more than ten operating methods that can extend the life of the furnace. This matter vividly illustrates the great power of patriotic ideological education and patriotic covenants.
　　Good Way to Promote the Patriotic Increase Production Movement
　　Farmers in Rongshi Township, Lixian County, Hunan Province, conducted an evaluation of the cotton planted by each household in early July. According to the conditions of the cotton planting competition, the evaluation content was: (1) to see who's cotton grows well, who fertilizes more, and who weeds diligently; (2) whether they accept technical guidance and improve farming methods; (3) whether they care about national affairs, whether they read newspapers and attend night school seriously, and whether they understand the principles of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and expanding cotton planting. After careful inspection and evaluation throughout the township, it was generally recognized that the cotton planted by poor peasant Wang Benxie was the best, and his mutual aid group's cotton field cultivated on behalf of the families of the Volunteer Army was also very good. Young farmer Tao Xuebo organized newspaper reading most actively and achieved the greatest results. After the evaluation, the patriotic increase production movement in Rongshi Township has greatly advanced. Farmers in each household have formulated plans for increasing production and donation. In the ten days or so after the evaluation, the township's cotton fields have all been fertilized three times and weeded seven times. Wang Benxie's mutual aid group proposed that they would guarantee a bumper cotton harvest and donate 88 catties of ginned cotton to purchase airplanes and artillery. The experience of Rongshi Township proves that conducting regular evaluations is a good way to promote the patriotic increase production movement.
　　Hebei Holds Training Class for Cotton Grading Personnel
　　In many areas of Hebei Province, the "superior cotton, superior price" policy has not been correctly grasped in cotton purchasing work, which has dampened cotton farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton and affected the balance between cotton prices and market prices. In order to correct deviations in a timely manner, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Provincial Cooperative Federation jointly instructed each special district to immediately hold training classes for cotton grading personnel. The training targets are mainly business personnel of grass-roots cooperatives in high-quality cotton promotion areas. The course content includes cotton price policies, identification of seed cotton varieties, and seed cotton grading inspection. The training class in Handan Special District started on June 20th, and other special districts are preparing. The "Provincial High-Quality Cotton Ginning Factory Grading Personnel Training Class" held by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry in Tongxian Special District also officially started on July 3rd. This is a necessary measure. However, two points should be noted: (1) In addition to business subjects in the course content, it is also necessary to conduct appropriate patriotic and worker-peasant alliance education; (2) Pay attention not to drag out the training time for too long.

  平炉连续炼钢的全国最新纪录
    上海钢铁公司某厂一个平炉，到七月二十一日止，已连续安全炼钢四百五十五炉，创全国最新纪录。该炉所产炭素钢锭的质量达百分之九十九。六月初爱国增产捐献运动展开时，该炉炉龄已到达三百炉。但是，该炉工人为捐献武器的号召所鼓舞，都认为：“多炼一炉钢，就是对志愿军打胜仗多一份帮助。”所以把延长平炉寿命的要求订入了爱国公约。炉龄到达四百炉时，该炉工人曾写信给毛主席，保证“延长炉龄到四百五十炉”。现在，这一保证已超额实现了。平炉寿命延长的主要原因是有关该炉生产的各部门、该炉各班组工人之间加强了联系，并不断地改进了操作方法。他们一共找出了十余种可使炉子寿命延长的操作方法。这件事情，生动地说明了爱国主义的思想教育和爱国公约的巨大力量。
  推动爱国增产运动的好办法
    湖南省澧县荣市乡的农民，在七月上旬对各户种的棉花，进行了一次评比。根据植棉竞赛的条件，评比的内容是：（一）看谁的棉花长得好，施肥多，锄草勤；（二）接受技术指导和改进耕作法没有；（三）关心不关心国家大事，是不是认真读报和上夜校，懂不懂抗美援朝和扩大植棉的道理。经过全乡认真检查和评比的结果，公认贫农王本协的棉花种的最好，他的互助组给志愿军家属代耕的棉田也很好。青年农民陶学伯组织读报最积极，成绩最大。评比后，荣市乡的爱国增产运动大大前进了一步。各户农民都订了增产捐献的计划，在评比后十多天中，全乡的棉田都已作到追三次肥和锄七次草。王本协互助组提出他们要保证棉花丰收，要捐献八十八斤皮棉来购买飞机大炮。荣市乡这个经验，证明了定期进行评比是推动爱国增产运动的好办法。
  河北举办棉花分级人员训练班
    河北省不少地区在购棉工作中未能正确掌握“优棉优价”政策，打击了棉农植棉情绪，影响了棉花牌价与市价的平衡。为及时纠正偏差，河北省农林厅和该省合作总社联合指示各专区，立即举办棉花分级人员训练班。训练对象以良棉推广区基层合作社的业务员为主，课程内容为棉价政策、籽棉品种鉴定、籽棉分级检验等。邯郸专区的训练班已在六月二十日开课，其他各专区都在筹备中。该省农林厅在通县专区举办的“全省良棉轧花厂分级人员训练班”也已在七月三日正式开课。这是一项必要的措施。但要注意两点：（一）在课程内容中，除了业务科目之外，适当地进行爱国主义的和工农联盟的教育也是必要的；（二）要注意不把训练时间拖得很长。
