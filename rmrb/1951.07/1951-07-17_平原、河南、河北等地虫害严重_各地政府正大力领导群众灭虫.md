　　[This Newspaper Dispatch] Due to the recent hot and dry weather, insect pests in various places continue to develop and occur. Aphids have occurred universally in the cotton-growing areas of Pingyuan Province, and some areas have been affected by the flowering of cotton. The four special districts of Luoyang, Shangqiu, Chenliu, and Zhengzhou in Henan Province are the most severely affected, with cotton leaves mostly curled and withered. Some cotton farmers feel unable to control the pests and are preparing to switch to other crops. Although Hebei Province has vigorously led prevention and control efforts, cotton aphids are still continuing to spread in various places. In the Langfang cotton-growing guidance area, red spiders have spread to more than 20,000 mu, and some cotton leaves have begun to fall off. Tobacco aphids have also begun to occur in the Xuchang Special District of Henan, with Yexian, Yuxian, Wuyang, Xiangcheng, Xuchang, and Lin颍 counties being more severely affected. Some people have already pulled out the affected tobacco seedlings to plant late autumn crops.
    In order to quickly eliminate insect pests, governments at all levels are dispatching a large number of cadres, carrying medicine and machinery, to go deep into areas where insect pests occur, to lead and organize the masses to carry out large-scale insect extermination campaigns. The Henan Provincial People's Government has listed pest control work as an important political task. In addition to organizing more than 800 cadres and students from agricultural institutions and students from the Agricultural College of Henan University, it has also organized more than 2,000 students from trade, industry, labor, finance, cadre schools, and the Administrative College of Henan University. After two days of technical training, on the 16th, they went to the pest-infested areas to help farmers control aphids. It has also instructed special offices and county people's governments to organize a large number of personnel, who will undergo short-term technical training, and then quickly go to the countryside to mobilize and organize the masses to prevent and control insect pests; and to promote local medicines and methods as much as possible, and to cooperate with the use of medicines and machinery to launch a surprise attack on aphids, and strive to eliminate the harm of aphids in the shortest possible time to ensure a bumper harvest of more than 2 million mu of cotton fields. The agricultural and forestry departments of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces have dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to teach aphid control techniques and organize the masses to carry out aphid control work. According to statistics from 472 villages in six counties including Huolu, Luancheng, and Jingxing in Hebei, 7,583 village cadres and production activists have learned aphid control techniques. Party members, League members, labor models, and rural technicians have played a leading role and have become the backbone of insect control work. Many county heads and deputy county heads have personally led working groups to go deep into the countryside to lead aphid control work. After the occurrence of red spiders in the Langfang cotton-growing guidance area, medicines and machinery were immediately allocated and technical personnel were sent to rescue the situation.
    In Yiyang and Yichuan counties in Luoyang Special District, Henan Province, the first batch of locust nymphs began to appear in mid-March. By mid-June, a total of four batches had occurred, expanding to 346 townships in 7 counties, covering an area of 1.2 million mu. After each batch of locust nymphs appeared, the masses were organized to vigorously catch and kill them. More than 20,000 people participated in locust extermination in Yiyang every day. Most of the locust nymphs were caught and killed before the third instar. 70% of the locust nymphs in the county's 52,000 mu have been eliminated. Recently, after the rain, the fifth batch of locust nymphs has begun to appear, and the first batch of surviving locusts has laid eggs, and young nymphs are also hatching and emerging from the soil batch by batch. 4,000 mu of autumn crops in Yichuan and Yiyang have been damaged. Now that the seedlings are tall, catching and killing is more difficult, and the masses have gradually become tired due to long-term catching and killing. In order to overcome this phenomenon, awards for models were held in a timely manner, patriotic education was strengthened, and the enthusiasm of the masses for locust catching was consolidated and improved. The insect extermination campaign is continuing vigorously.

　　平原、河南、河北等地虫害严重
　  各地政府正大力领导群众灭虫
    【本报讯】最近由于天气燥热，各地的虫害仍在继续发展和发生。平原省各植棉区普遍发生了蚜虫，部分地区已影响到棉花的开花。河南省洛阳、商邱、陈留、郑州四个专区为最严重，棉叶多已卷曲萎缩，有的棉农感觉无法防治，准备改种其他作物。河北全省虽经大力领导防治，但目前各地棉蚜仍在继续蔓延中。在廊坊植棉指导区，红蜘蛛已扩展至二万多亩，部分棉叶开始脱落。烟蚜亦在河南许昌专区开始发生，其中以叶县、禹县、舞阳、襄城、许昌、临颍等县较重，群众已有将被害烟苗拔掉改种晚秋作物的现象。
    各地政府为了迅速消灭虫害，正在调派大批干部，携带药械，深入虫害发生地区，领导和组织群众开展大规模的灭虫运动。河南省人民政府已将治虫工作列为一个重要的政治任务，除了组织农业机构的干部、学员与河南大学农学院学生等八百余人外，又组织了贸易、工业、劳动、财政、干部学校学员及河南大学行政学院学生等两千余人，经过两天技术训练后，于十六日分赴虫害区帮助农民扑灭蚜虫。并已指示各专署及县人民政府应组织大批力量，经过短期技术训练后，即迅速下乡动员和组织群众防除虫害；并要尽量提倡土药土法，配合使用药械，突击治蚜，争取于最短期间消灭蚜虫的为害，保证二百余万亩棉田的丰收。河北与平原两省农林厅均已派出大批干部下乡传授治蚜技术和组织群众进行治蚜工作，据河北获鹿、栾城、井陉等六县四百七十二个村的统计，已有七千五百八十三名村干和生产积极分子学会了治蚜的技术。各地的党员、团员、劳动模范与农村技术员等都发挥了带头作用，并已成为治虫工作中的骨干力量。许多的县长、副县长都亲率工作组深入乡村领导治蚜工作。廊坊植棉指导区发生红蜘蛛后随即拨发药械并派技术人员前往抢救。
    河南省洛阳专区宜阳与伊川两县自三月中即开始发生了第一批蝗蝻，到六月中旬前后共发生了四批，扩大到七个县二十九个区三百四十六个乡，面积达一百二十万亩，每批蝗蝻发生之后，即组织群众大力捕打，伊阳每天都有二万余人参加灭蝗，大部蝗蝻均在三龄以下即被捕灭，全县五万二千亩的蝗蝻已消灭了百分之七十。最近雨后又有第五批蝗蝻开始发生，第一批残存蝗虫已经产卵，幼蝻亦逐批孵化出土，伊川、伊阳已有四千亩秋禾被吃坏。现在禾苗高大，捕打已较困难，群众由于长期捕打，逐渐产生了疲惫情绪。各地为了克服这种现象，适时地举行了评奖模范，加强爱国主义教育，巩固和提高了群众的捕蝗积极性，灭虫运动，正在继续大力进行中。
