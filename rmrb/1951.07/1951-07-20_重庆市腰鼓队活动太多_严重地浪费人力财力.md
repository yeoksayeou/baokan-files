The public security stations, trade union cultural and educational departments, and other relevant departments in Chongqing have failed to properly guide the masses to use waist drum teams, yangko teams, and other activities during appropriate recreational activity times. This has resulted in a tendency towards indiscriminate drumming and extravagance, causing public dissatisfaction.

Some waist drum teams excessively emphasize aesthetic appearance and waste resources. Some public security stations even advocate and encourage large drum teams and waist drum teams, using beautiful clothes and diverse patterns as competition criteria. For example, the city's "Liquid Fuel Industry Large Drum Team" has a total of sixty-four members (including shop assistants, traders, and shop owners). When it was established last December, each member made a set of calico clothes and bought seventeen large drums and drum racks. The clothes and drums alone cost over six million yuan. Before the "May Day" parade this year, all the costumes were replaced with silk antique-style clothes, boots, and hats. The seventeen drum racks were also replaced with new ones (ten were newly bought, and seven were donated by shop owners). Each drum was sewn with a new cover. This cost approximately 14.87 million yuan. Similarly, a waist drum team in Guihua Street Police Station originally had twenty sets of clothes. Before "May Day," seeing that other waist drum teams had sewn new clothes, they sewed forty new sets, costing over four million yuan. The waist drum team of the first branch of the hardware industry shop employees' union requested the union to treat them every time they played the waist drum (having already treated them four or five times, spending forty to fifty thousand yuan). The sources of these funds are mostly from mobilizing the masses to donate or from "leading" donations by activists. Xu He Kui (manager of Da Zhong Hua Rubber Factory) of Guihua Street Police Station alone donated four million yuan successively (most of which was used for recreational activities), and Qi Hanqing (manager of Chongqing Native Produce Company) donated two million yuan. Such arbitrary fundraising from the masses has caused public dissatisfaction.

Many waist drum teams do not observe the order of life, drumming everywhere regardless of day or night, production or rest time, or occasion. Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, but many people still brave the scorching sun to play the waist drum, which wastes time, hinders production and physical health, and also disrupts the lives of the general public and obstructs traffic order. The newly organized Native Produce Bundling Industry Union waist drum team in the city has more than twenty participants, all of whom are employed workers. Every morning, they drum from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, and in the afternoon from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Excluding rest and recreational activity time, each person wastes at least three hours of production time each day. Jianjiaqiao Police Station, Guihua Street Police Station, and others have even mobilized many schoolchildren and young children to play the waist drum, which affects their studies and physical health. The Jianjiaqiao 180-member children's waist drum team includes 160 students, most of whom are only four to twelve years old. Before the "May Day" parade this year, they often started drumming before dawn, sometimes until late at night. The students were listless or dozed off during class in the daytime; some even asked for leave due to drumming. More than sixty children in a waist drum team in Guihua Street fell ill due to over-fatigue during the "May Day" parade this year. Children's parents and school teachers have criticized this.

Since Labor Day, the phenomenon of indiscriminate drumming and extravagance has begun to be corrected, but some cadres have not actively led this work.

### 重庆市腰鼓队活动太多  严重地浪费人力财力

　　重庆市腰鼓队活动太多
    严重地浪费人力财力
    重庆市各公安派出所、各行业工会文教部门等有关方面，因未能很好地引导群众将腰鼓队、秧歌队等活动用在适当的文娱活动时间，结果产生了到处乱打，铺张浪费的偏向，并引起群众不满。
    有些腰鼓队过分讲究形式漂亮，铺张浪费，甚至有的派出所竟提倡鼓励大鼓队、腰鼓队，以衣服漂亮、花样多作为挑战竞赛。以该市“液体燃料业大鼓队”为例，全队共有六十四人（有店员、交易员、商店老板等），去年十二月成立时，每人都做了一套花布衣服，并买了十七个大鼓和鼓架。只衣服和大鼓就花了六百多万元，今年“五一”游行以前，又将全部服装都换成绸子古装式的衣服、靴帽；十七个鼓架也换成新的（内有十个是新买的，七个由商店老板捐出）；并在每一个鼓上都缝了一个新套子。这样就花去了大约一千四百八十七万余元。又如桂花街派出所一腰鼓队，原有二十套衣服，“五一”以前看到其他腰鼓队都缝了新衣服，又新缝了四十套衣服，花了四百多万元。五金业行业店员工会第一分会腰鼓队，每打一次腰鼓就要求工会请客（已请过四、五次，花费四、五十万元）。这些经费的来源大多是动员群众募捐或由积极分子“带头”捐出的。桂花街派出所徐和奎（大中华橡胶厂经理）一人即先后捐出四百万元（大部分是用于文娱活动），漆汉卿（重庆土产行经理）捐出二百万元。这次“液体燃料业大鼓队”改换服装，只久记油行即捐三百万元，四川裕丰油行捐二百万元。这样随意向群众募捐的作法，引起了群众的不满。
    许多腰鼓队不遵守生活秩序，不分白天黑夜，不分生产与休息时间，不分什么场合，到处乱打。近来天气酷热，仍有不少人冒着烈日打腰鼓，这样既浪费时间，妨碍了生产和身体健康，而且也扰乱广大市民的生活和妨碍交通秩序。该市不久前新组织的土产业捆制业工会腰鼓队，有二十多人参加，他们都是在业工人，每天早上从六点钟打到九点钟，下午从五点种打到七点钟，除去休息和文娱活动时间，每人每天最少要耽误三个钟头的生产时间。蹇家桥派出所、桂花街派出所等更动员了许多学校儿童和年幼的儿童打腰鼓，影响了他们的学习和身体健康。蹇家桥一百八十个儿童的腰鼓队，内有一百六十个儿童是学生，年龄大都只有四岁到十二岁。在今年“五一”游行以前，常常从天不亮就打起，有时打到深更半夜，同学们白天上课时无精打彩或打瞌睡；甚至有因打腰鼓而请假的。桂花街一腰鼓队的六十多个小朋友在今年“五一”游行时，因疲劳过度，有十多个小朋友生了病。儿童家长、学校教员都为此提出批评。
    “五一”劳动节以后，乱打腰鼓、铺张浪费的现象虽已开始纠正，但有些干部对这一工作仍没有积极加以领导。
