Let us solemnly celebrate July 1st, and enthusiastically praise July 1st. Because on July 1st thirty years ago—this glorious day—a dazzling record in human history was created: the birth of the Chinese Communist Party. It brought new life to the ancient Chinese nation, new hope to the oppressed people of East Asia, and also strengthened the new confidence of the working people of the world in moving towards a communist society. In these glorious thirty years, the Chinese Communist Party has grown from birth to become the sole leading force of New China. Its glorious history of success inspires every conscientious person. Its rich content enriches human history and is inexhaustible and countless!

Speaking of celebration, in fact, in the hearts of every Chinese people, there is not a day that they are not celebrating, because the Communist Party has brought us into this happy new era—an era of liberation from feudalism and imperialism, an era in which the people have turned over to live a good life, an era in which every young person has a bright future, and a great era in which our motherland stands up in the world. Speaking of praise, we are actually praising it all the time. Because the great revolutionary epic of the Communist Party, written in blood, is full of subjects for praise, countless subjects worthy of praise.

Instead of celebrating aimlessly and praising incompletely, it is better to take advantage of this auspicious occasion and offer a pledge to the Party from a scientific worker: this pledge sincerely expresses my willingness to forever follow the Communist Party and, under its leadership, strive to build a new China.

　　　　I guarantee: Overcome the mentality of being a guest and purely technical viewpoints

Scientific workers often have a tendency towards "bystanderism, the mentality of being a guest" and "purely technical viewpoints." This is not the attitude that the masters of New China should have. On this glorious festival, I would like to pledge to the Party that I will not allow myself to be infected in this regard, and if I unconsciously make a mistake, I will immediately correct it after discovering it. At the same time, I will do my best to stop the spread of this tendency among scientific workers, and even eliminate it.

　　　　I guarantee: Do a good job in unity

"Scholars despise each other!" It is undeniable that in the old society, there was a considerable amount of infighting, exclusion, sectarianism, and factionalism among scientific workers. Now that we have stepped into the new society, this legacy still remains to some extent. On this glorious day, I would like to pledge to the Party that I will do a good job in unity. Unite with all patriotic scientific workers, under the banner of Mao Zedong, and work together to build the motherland. More resolutely overcome sectarian prejudices and further strive to build the only tradition of New China—the tradition of serving the people.

　　　　I guarantee: Educate young people without reservation

In the old society, there was a social phenomenon: "Teach the apprentice, starve the master." This concern hindered the progress of science and technology in China. On this birthday of the Party, I pledge to the Party: I will never keep any secrets. Any politically clean youth of New China, if they need my knowledge, I will definitely pass it on to them without reservation and to the best of my knowledge, so that they can become cadres for the construction of New China.

　　　　I guarantee: Subordinate my own interests to the interests of the whole people

Finally, I would like to pledge to the Party again that I am determined to subordinate my own interests to the interests of the whole people, wholeheartedly and courageously attack the scientific fortress, and go forward to meet the arrival of the new high tide of culture predicted by Chairman Mao! Comrades! Let us thank Chairman Mao and the Party he leads. Because they have led the people to pave the way, this enables every scientific worker to gloriously and actively participate in this new high tide of cultural construction. Let us all unite under the leadership of the great Communist Party and bravely march forward!

　　在共产党的生日向党保证
    华罗庚
    让我们来隆重地庆祝七一，热烈地歌颂七一。因为三十年前的七月一日——这个光荣的日子里，产生了人类史上一个光芒万丈的纪录——中国共产党的诞生。它带给了古老的中华民族新的生命，带给了东亚被压迫人民新的希望，同时也加强了全世界劳动人民向共产主义社会迈进的新信心。在这光辉的三十年代中，中国共产党已经由诞生而壮大，而成为新中国的唯一的领导力量。他的光荣的成功史实，鼓舞着每一个有良知的人们。他的丰富的内容，充实了人类的历史，是说不完，数不尽的！
    说庆祝，实际在全中国的每一个人民的心底里，没有一天不在庆幸，因为共产党把我们带进了这幸福的新时代——从封建主义帝国主义压迫下解放出来的时代，人民翻身过好日子的时代，每个青年都有远大前程的时代，我们祖国在世界上站起来的伟大的时代。说歌颂，我们实际上无时无刻不在歌颂。因为在共产党的革命的伟大的用血写下的史诗上，充满了歌颂的题材，无量数的值得歌颂的题材。
    与其不着边际地庆祝，挂一漏万地歌颂，不如乘此良辰，向党提出一个科学工作者的保证：这保证由衷地表示了我愿意永远追随共产党，在他的领导下，为建设新中国而努力。
            我保证：克服作客思想和纯技术观点
    科学工作者们往往有“旁观主义，作客思想”及“纯技术观点”的偏向。这不是新中国主人翁所应有的态度。在这光荣的节日里，我谨向党提出保证，不让自己有向这一方面的倾染，如果不自觉地犯了错误，决定在发现之后立刻纠正。同时竭尽所能地使这种倾向在科学工作者之间停止传播，而至于消灭。
            我保证：做好团结工作
    “文人相轻”！无可讳言地，在旧社会里，科学工作者之间，有过相当多的倾轧，排挤，宗派，门户。现在我们虽已跨进了新社会，但这种遗毒依然或多或少地有些余留，在这光荣的日子里，我谨向党保证，做好团结工作。和一切爱国的科学工作者团结在一起，在毛泽东旗帜之下，共同为建设祖国而努力。更坚决地克服宗派门户等偏见，进一步为建设新中国的唯一传统——为人民服务的传统而努力。
            我保证：毫无保留地教育青年
    在旧社会里曾存在过：“教会徒弟，饿死师父”的社会现象，这种顾忌曾阻滞了中国科学技术的进展。我乘此党的生日，向党提出保证：我决不保留丝毫的秘密，任何政治清白的新中国的青年，如果需要我的知识，我一定毫无保留地，尽我所知地传给他们，使他们成为新中国建设的干部。
            我保证：把一己的利益服从全民的利益
    最后，我再向党提出保证，决定把一己的利益，服从于全民的利益，全心全意地奋勇地向科学堡垒进攻，上前去迎接毛主席所预示的文化新高潮的到来！同志们！让我们感谢毛主席，和他所领导的党。因为领导着人民铺好了道路，这使每个科学工作者都能光荣地积极地参与这文化建设新高潮，让我们大家团结在伟大的共产党领导下奋勇迈进吧！
