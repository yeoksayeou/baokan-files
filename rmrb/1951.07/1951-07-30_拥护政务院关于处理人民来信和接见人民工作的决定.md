　　Supporting the Government Administration Council's Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People

To the Editor:
    After reading the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, I deeply felt the concern of the Central People's Government for the masses. Relatives living in the countryside also wrote to me saying: When our hometown was first liberated, some cadres had a rigid work style, and the masses did not dare to raise any opinions at all. Later, the province issued an order to correct this, and these cadres were indeed much better than before. This time, the Central People's Government has issued this "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People," so it will definitely be even better. Chairman Mao truly cares for us people.
    From this letter, it can be seen that the masses greatly welcome Chairman Mao's decision.
    Regarding the implementation of this decision, I have a few small suggestions of my own for the editor's reference: (1) This decision should be widely publicized in the countryside so that the vast number of peasants can know that the government has this decision. (2) The locations of the specialized agencies established by people's governments at all levels for handling people's letters and receiving people should be announced to the people in local newspapers.

### 拥护政务院关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定

　　拥护政务院关于处理人民
　  来信和接见人民工作的决定编辑同志：
    我读了中央人民政府政务院公布的“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，深深感到中央人民政府对人民群众的关心。住在农村的亲戚也写信给我说：我们家乡刚解放的时候，有一些干部作风生硬，群众有意见根本就不敢提，后来省里下命令纠正了一下，这些干部的确比以前好多了。这一回，中央人民政府又发了这个“处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”，那一定会更好了，毛主席真是关心我们人民。
    从这封信里可以看得出群众是非常欢迎毛主席这个决定的。
    对于这个决定的执行，我自己有几点小意见，请编辑同志参考：（一）应把这个决定广泛地在乡村进行宣传，使广大的农民都能知道政府有这个决定。（二）各级人民政府所设立的处理人民来信和接见人民的专门机构所在地，应在当地报纸上向人民公布出来。
