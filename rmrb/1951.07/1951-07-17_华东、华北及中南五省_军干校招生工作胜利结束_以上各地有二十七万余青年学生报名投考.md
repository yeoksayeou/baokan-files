After the establishment of the military cadre school enrollment committees at all levels in the region at the end of June, the enrollment task was completed within a short period of half a month. Local people's organizations, teachers and students of various schools, and parents of students all participated in the publicity and mobilization work for enrollment. Student representatives from various military branches also went to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places to report to the broad masses of young people about their pleasant learning lives. Currently, teachers and students from schools in East China and people from all walks of life are enthusiastically sending off the admitted students to the schools, and class, school-wide, and regional send-off meetings have been held in various places. Shanghai held a city-wide send-off meeting for youth representatives from all walks of life with more than 7,000 people on the 14th.

　　In the North China region, the registration work for youth students from five provinces and two cities to participate in military cadre schools has basically ended, with a total of 42,952 students registered. The approved students are now successively going to various military cadre schools to enroll, and they are receiving enthusiastic condolences and send-offs from the broad masses of students, teachers, parents, and people from all walks of life. Beijing and Tianjin held city-wide send-off meetings on the 12th and 13th respectively. The people of Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and other provinces are enthusiastically sending off their beloved children to the glorious posts of national defense construction. Students from various places who have been approved to participate in military cadre schools have gathered at the reception stations and are beginning to go to various military cadre schools.

　　In the Central and South China region, the enrollment work has been successfully concluded in all provinces except Guangxi. According to preliminary statistics, the number of students who registered in various places reached 110,000. At present, reception stations have been established in various provinces and cities, and they are starting to handle the concentration and send-off work for the admitted students. In addition to the send-off meetings held by major universities and middle schools in Wuhan, more than 2,000 representatives of people from all walks of life held a send-off meeting on the 15th. After the meeting, the students participating in military cadre schools paraded around the main streets of Wuhan in 45 trucks. Citizens set up seven send-off stations along the way. When the parading students passed by, pedestrians cheered on both sides of the road, and shops set off firecrackers.

　　The broad masses of young students not only actively registered to participate in military cadre schools, but most of them were also able to resolutely obey the organization's arrangements. Students who were not approved due to physical or other reasons that did not meet the registration requirements all expressed that they would study diligently, pay attention to physical exercise, and go to other construction posts in the motherland.
