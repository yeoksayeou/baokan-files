　　Broad Solicitation of Opinions Should Precede Film Shoots
　　Editor:
　　The criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has made me think that the phenomenon of many poorly made bad films appearing nowadays should be given serious attention. Films have a great impact on people's thinking and cost a lot of manpower and material resources. We cannot but ask filmmakers to minimize or even eliminate products with serious errors. Before filming each film, the film studio should present the theme, story points, etc., and widely solicit opinions. It should even publish the screenplay as early as possible to understand the reactions of the masses in all aspects. In particular, departments related to the content of the script must be consulted in advance. The post-performance review of the effect and summary should also be prompt and without delay. We ask the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the National Film Art Workers Association to attach sufficient importance to film work; strengthen its leadership, and in particular, not allow the production work of private film factories to develop spontaneously. This is a matter of being responsible for the spiritual food of the broad masses of the people. Literary and artistic waste products will have a bad effect, and they are not just waste products.

　　The error of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is serious. We feel that there are other individual films that, although do not have such serious errors, have greatly distorted real life because the writers and directors do not have sufficient understanding of the Party's policies, the lives and qualities of workers, peasants, soldiers and revolutionary cadres. For example, the film "Company Commander Guan" is like this, giving the audience a bad influence after the performance.
　　In order to prevent the people's films from spreading feudalism and the toxic thoughts of the bourgeoisie, in order to correctly express the people's struggle life and the image of the people, and make the film truly an important propaganda tool, we suggest:
　　1. The film script must be carefully reviewed by the Central Film Bureau, the organ responsible for reviewing films, with a high degree of responsibility to the people, before it is produced. If there are shortcomings or scripts with undesirable ideological content, the writers and directors should be asked to revise them, or be prohibited from producing them, so as to avoid wasting manpower and material resources and poisoning the broad audience.
　　2. In particular, the leadership of private film factories should be strengthened. Recently, we have not only seen the seriously flawed "The Life of Wu Xun" and the seriously flawed "Company Commander Guan", but also the films produced by private film factories such as "Long Live the Missus", "The Movie Fan's Story" and "Square Hats", which have varying degrees of relatively serious shortcomings. The Central Film Bureau should take effective measures to strengthen the leadership and education of film screenwriters, directors, and actors, and improve their ideological and artistic level.

### 影片拍摄前应广泛征求意见

　　影片拍摄前应广泛征求意见编辑同志：
    由于对电影《武训传》的批判，我想到如今还有不少粗制滥造的坏影片出现的现象是应该加以严重注意的。电影对于人民思想的影响极大，而且花费人力物力很多，我们不能不要求电影工作者尽量减少以至消灭有严重错误的产品。电影厂在每一部影片的开始拍摄以前，最好把主题、故事要点等提出，广泛征求意见。甚至应尽可能把电影剧本先发表，了解各方面群众的反应。特别对于与剧本内容有关的部门，更必须事先征求意见。演出以后检查效果作总结也要迅速而不耽搁。我们要求文化部电影局和中华全国文学艺术界联合会及全国电影艺术工作者协会等机构足够地重视电影工作；加强领导它，尤其不可以让私营影片厂的摄制工作发生自流现象。这是对广大人民精神食粮负责的问题。文艺废品是会产生坏作用的，还不仅是废品而已。
          丁木编辑同志：
    电影《武训传》的错误是严重的。我们觉得还有其他个别的片子，虽然没有这样严重的错误，但由于编导者对党的政策、工农兵和革命干部的生活、品质没有足够的了解，所以对现实生活作了很大的歪曲，如影片《关连长》，就是这样，演出后给观众以不良影响。
    为了防止人民电影传播封建主义及资产阶级有毒害的思想，为了能够正确表现人民斗争生活和人民的形象，使电影真正成为重要的宣传工具，我们建议：
    一、电影剧本在摄制前一定要由负责审查电影的机关中央电影局，以高度向人民负责的精神，对每个电影剧本认真进行审查，如有缺点或有不良思想内容的剧本，要使编导者修改，或禁止摄制。以免浪费人力物力，对广大观众发生毒害。
    二、尤其应加强对私营电影厂的领导。最近我们不仅看到有严重错误的《武训传》及有严重缺点的《关连长》，而且还看到了《太太万岁》、《影迷传》和《方帽子》之类的私营电影厂出品的影片，都有着程度不同的、比较严重的缺点。中央电影局应采取有效的办法，加强对电影编剧、导演、演员的领导和教育，提高他们的思想和艺术水平。
