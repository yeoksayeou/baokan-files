Xinhua News Agency, July 19th dispatch:  Electronegative News Agency Manila, July 16th dispatch: Regardless of whether there will be a ceasefire in Korea in the future, the United States will continue to use South Korea as a major army base in the U.S. Far East military base system. An Electronegative News Agency reporter learned from a senior American in Manila that U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Alexander informed General Ridgway, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, and General Van Fleet, Commander of the Eighth Army, of this decision during his visit to Japan and Korea earlier this month.

During his meetings with Ridgway and Van Fleet, Alexander gave them a directive from Secretary of Defense Marshall and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley. This directive stipulated the tasks that the United Nations forces would undertake once the Korean War ceased. The directive stipulated that the United Nations forces would be used to build military warehouses, highways, railways, and to construct airfields, runways, seaports, and barracks, etc. The directive instructed that these facilities should be built very well so that all war materials, weapons, and ammunition supplies currently in the hands of the United Nations forces could remain in Korea and be well hidden.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Prague news: The New York "Workers' Daily" commented on July 13 on the U.S. side's unreasonable interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations, saying: "Is there anything more far-fetched than suddenly insisting that twenty journalists are 'United Nations personnel' who must be allowed to cover the Kaesong talks, using this as an excuse to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations?"

The editorial wrote: "For months, the telegrams sent by reporters have been subject to censorship and severe deletions, and now suddenly these reporters are being brought up again. The generals say that if reporters are not allowed to cover the talks, they will launch another large-scale massacre!"

The editorial said: "The public pressure to resolve the Korean issue is enormous. But the evil forces in high positions have never relaxed their efforts to sabotage the Korean negotiations for a minute. A ceasefire in Korea remains something that must be fought for."

　　美阴谋继续利用南朝鲜基地
　  《工人日报》斥美反动派破坏谈判
    【新华社十九日讯】电通社马尼拉十六日电：美国不管将来在朝鲜是不是停战，它将继续将南朝鲜作为美国远东军事基地体系中的一个主要陆军基地。电通社记者从马尼拉的一个美国高级人士获悉：美国陆军部副部长亚力山大本月初访问日本和朝鲜时，曾把这个决定通知远东美军总司令李奇微和第八军军长范佛里特。
    亚力山大在他与李奇微和范佛里特举行的会议上，曾把国防部长马歇尔和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷的一件训令交给李奇微和范佛里特。这个训令是规定一旦朝鲜战事停止联合国军将要负担的任务。训令规定：联合国军将被用来建筑军事仓库、公路、铁路和修建飞机场、跑道、海港及营房等。训令指示：要把这些设备建筑得很好，以使目前在联合国军手中的所有战争物资、武器及弹药供应品都能留在朝鲜，好好地暗藏起来。
    【新华社讯】布拉格消息：纽约《工人日报》于七月十三日评论美方曾无理中断朝鲜停火谈判说：“突然硬说二十个新闻记者是‘联合国人员’，必须准许他们去采访开城会谈，借故阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，还有比这做得更牵强的吗？”
    社论写道：“几个月来，记者发出的电讯一直受到检查和严重的删节，现在突然间又把这些记者抬出来了。将军们说，如果不准许记者去采访，他们就要再发动大规模的屠杀！”
    社论说：“要求解决朝鲜问题的舆论压力是巨大的。但是高踞要津的恶势力破坏朝鲜谈判的努力一分钟也不曾放松过。朝鲜的停火仍然是必须奋斗才能得到的。”
