　  Cotton farmers are fighting to eliminate aphids
    Farmers in cotton-producing areas of Pingyuan and Hebei Provinces are vigorously working to eliminate aphids. In late May, cotton fields in more than ten counties in Pingyuan Province, including Guancheng, Puyang, Qingfeng, Dongming, and Heze, successively experienced aphid infestations. Recently, 30 percent of cotton fields in Hebei Province have been affected by cotton aphids.
    After the occurrence of cotton aphids, the People's Governments of Pingyuan and Hebei Provinces vigorously led the masses to carry out elimination and mobilized a large number of women and children to participate. In order to quickly eliminate cotton aphids, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Pingyuan Province organized an aphid control team of thirty people and rushed to various places to assist farmers in aphid control. The Wenxian Farm in the province also dispatched cadres carrying medicine and machinery to areas severely affected by cotton aphids to help farmers eliminate them. Cotton-producing areas in Hebei Province, such as Luancheng and Jin County, have widely launched mass aphid control campaigns, and some areas have been treated twice. The People's Governments of counties such as Huolu, Zanhuang, Luancheng, and Jingxing in the province have also held short-term aphid control training courses, with more than 7,500 cadres and farmers trained, which has greatly helped in preventing and controlling cotton aphids. At the same time, the Shijiazhuang Special District Cooperative Federation has loaned more than 8,000 sprayers to cotton farmers. The county cooperatives in the district have also transported a large number of aphid control agents from other places to supply farmers' needs.

　　平原河北两省产棉地区
　  棉农为消灭蚜虫而斗争
    平原、河北两省各产棉区农民正在大力除治蚜虫。五月下旬，平原省观城、濮阳、清丰、东明、菏泽等十余县，棉田相继发生蚜虫。最近，河北省发生棉蚜的棉田有百分之三十。
    当棉蚜发生后，平原、河北两省人民政府即大力领导群众进行除治，并发动大批妇女、儿童参加。平原省农林厅为迅速扑灭棉蚜，组织了一个三十人的治蚜队，赶赴各地，协助农民治蚜。该省温县农场并派遣干部携带药械，分赴棉蚜为害严重的地区，帮助农民除治。河北省产棉区如栾城、晋县等县已普遍开展了群众性的治蚜运动，有的地区已除治了两遍。该省获鹿、赞皇、栾城、井陉等县人民政府并举办了治蚜短期训练班，受训的干部和农民达七千五百余人，对于防治棉蚜有很大帮助。同时，石家庄专区合作总社已贷给棉农喷雾器八千多架。该区各县社并自外地运回大批治蚜药剂，供应农民需用。
