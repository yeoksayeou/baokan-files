    CCP Qinyang County Committee
    Further Correct the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics
    Zixing, Xingzhun
    After cadres in Qinyang County, Pingyuan Province, underwent a test on current events and policies and studied the CCP Xinxiang District Committee’s circular “Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics,” some cadres have recognized the danger of not studying politics and have thus begun to strengthen their study of current events and policies. To some extent, the tendency of not caring about politics has changed. However, the problem is still quite serious, especially in cultural and educational institutions. In order to raise the political consciousness of cadres, the CCP Qinyang County Committee decided to spend nearly one and a half days in the recent county and district expanded cadre meeting to conduct tests and study the circular "Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics." Before the study, some district cadres said: "We are doing central work at the grassroots level every day. Suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Can you say that we are not asking about politics? Not asking about politics refers to people sitting in the office." Or they said: "I don't ask about politics because I am busy with work and the tasks are heavy, so I can't study." Some comrades in the post office even think that their work cannot be combined with politics. Some cadres engaged in economic work believe that "studying politics is just asking for trouble."

    This further illustrates that the tendency of these comrades not to ask about politics is serious. Especially some Communist Party members, they have not yet consciously realized that this is a vulgar style of the bourgeoisie. If this tendency of not asking about politics continues to develop without correction, it will not only be impossible to further improve work, but even the existing achievements cannot be consolidated. In response to this situation, the county party committee has focused on solving it from the following two aspects:

    1. All cadres should first focus on studying the circular "Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics" and deeply understand the harm of not studying politics. Leading cadres should enlighten everyone to consciously overcome the complacent feeling that they have already "asked about politics." When studying, first understand the spirit of the document and recognize that if we do not strengthen political study, we will become short-sighted mediocrities, or even degenerate politically and betray, causing serious losses to our work. And recognize that not asking about politics is a reflection of bourgeois ideology, thereby enhancing everyone's political consciousness, increasing political enthusiasm, and striving to study and work actively. A cadre from the supply and marketing cooperative said: "Some time ago, I developed the idea of lying down, mainly because I didn't ask about politics and didn't have a clear understanding of the current situation." A cultural instructor in the fifth district said: "In the past, I felt annoyed whenever I studied politics, just afraid of delaying my own business; now, I realize that if I don't study politics in the future, I will lag behind and not be able to do my work well." A section chief of the Public Security Bureau reviewed: "For the past six months, I have not read the newspaper well and have a purely professional view. During the test, I could only answer three of the five questions, and I was not even very clear about the targets and overall policies of suppressing counter-revolutionaries." Some cadres in the fourth district said: "In the past, we only knew how to work and didn't study politics, so the difficulties encountered in our work could not be solved, and we were very depressed. Now we know that this is because we didn't study politics and worked blindly. Although we did a lot of work, the gains were not great, and it was not connected to the overall political tasks."

    2. Combine with reality for inspection during study. Many cadres have realized from reviewing the reasons for their past achievements and shortcomings in their work that only with a clear political goal can they stand on their own posts and give full play to their enthusiasm; and combine their work with the goals of political struggle. A leading cadre in the first district said: "In the past year, especially since the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, cadres have paid attention to political study, and their work enthusiasm has increased, and the phenomenon of lying down and not doing anything has basically been eliminated." The county supply and marketing cooperative held a meeting of village supply and marketing cooperative cadres to arrange the task of pre-purchasing 200,000 catties of cotton in the county. At the meeting, due to the patriotic ideological mobilization of the leading cadres, the village supply and marketing cooperative cadres immediately reported the pre-purchase of 190,000 catties of cotton. The work of the bank has also progressed smoothly due to its attention to combining with the central work. This year, when the tax bureau collected taxes in Baixiang Town, it changed the past wrong understanding that "it doesn't matter whether you talk about politics or not, anyway, the tax bureau is asking businessmen for money, and they will not be satisfied with you," and carried out political mobilization, so the taxes were paid in full in one day. These show that the business of our various departments is subordinate to political goals, and we must overcome incorrect ideas such as "economic departments cannot combine with politics" and "participating in central work is a burden."

    After studying the documents and linking them to examining their own work, everyone initially realized that political issues are the most important issues that every Communist Party member and every revolutionary cadre should pay attention to. The "tendency of not asking about politics" not only exists in the economic departments, but also seriously exists in all departments, and a preliminary atmosphere of not studying politics is a shame has been formed. On this basis, the county party committee has also arranged to combine the study of party history, discuss and criticize the spirit of Wu Xun, and continue to check and correct the tendency of not asking about politics.

### 中共沁阳县委  进一步纠正不问政治的倾向

　　中共沁阳县委
　  进一步纠正不问政治的倾向
　　子兴、兴准
    平原省沁阳县干部，经过时事政策测验与学习中共新乡地委的“反对不问政治倾向”的通报后，部分干部已认识到不学政治的危险性，因而开始加强对时事政策的学习，不关心政治的倾向在某种程度上有所转变。但问题还是相当严重的，特别是文化教育机关最为突出。为了提高干部的政治觉悟，中共沁阳县县委决定在最近一次县区扩大干部会中，抽出将近一天半的时间进行测验，和学习“反对不问政治倾向”的通报。在学习前有些区干部说：“我们每天在下边作中心工作，镇压反革命就是抗美援朝工作，还能说不问政治吗？不问政治是指坐机关里的人说的。”或者说：“我不问政治是由于工作忙，任务繁重，压的没办法，不能学习。”邮政局有些同志竟认为自己的工作与政治不好结合。还有些作经济工作的干部认为“学政治是多找麻烦”。
    这更说明了这些同志不问政治的倾向是严重的。特别是一些共产党员，他们还没有自觉地认识到，这是资产阶级的庸俗作风。如果让这种不问政治的倾向继续发展下去，不加以纠正，不但不可能进一步作好工作，而且连已有的成果也不能巩固。针对此种情况，该县县委已着重从以下两个方面加以解决：
    一、全体干部首先着重学习“反对不问政治倾向”的通报、深刻地认识不学政治的危害性。领导干部要启发大家自觉地克服那种自认为已经“问政治了”的自满情绪。学习时，首先领会文件的精神，认识到如果不加强政治学习，会使我们成为鼠目寸光的庸人，甚而在政治上蜕化变节，使工作遭受严重的损失。并认识不问政治是资产阶级思想的反映，从而提高大家的政治自觉性，提高政治热情，努力学习，积极工作。供销社一个干部说：“前些时我产生了躺倒思想，这主要是由于自己不问政治，对目前形势认识不清。”五区文化教员说：“过去我一学政治心里就烦，光怕耽误本身业务；现在，我认识到今后不学政治就要落伍，作不好工作。”公安局一股长检讨说：“半年来我没有很好看报，存在着单纯业务观点。测验时，五道题我只能答三道，甚至连镇压反革命的对象及全面政策也不十分清楚。”四区一部分干部说：“过去只知作工作，不学政治，因此工作中遇到的困难不能解决，非常苦闷。现在知道了这是因为没学习政治，盲目工作，虽然也搞了很多工作，但是收获不大，与总的政治任务联系不起来。”
    二、学习中联系实际进行检查。很多干部从回顾过去工作中取得成绩和缺点的原因，体会到只有有了明确的政治目标，才能站在自己岗位上，发挥高度积极性；并使自己的工作与政治斗争目标结合起来。一区领导干部说：“一年来，特别是镇压反革命以来，干部注意了政治学习，工作情绪就高了，躺倒不干的现象基本上消灭了。”该县供销社召开村供销社干部会，布置全县预购二十万斤棉花的任务。会上由于领导干部进行了爱国主义思想动员，当场各村供销社干部即自报预购棉十九万斤。银行工作由于注意了与中心工作结合，工作的进行也顺利了。税务局今年在柏香镇征税时，改变了过去的“政治讲不讲没啥，反正税局是向工商业家要钱，他们是不会对你满意的”的错误认识，进行了政治动员，因此一天就缴齐了税。这些说明了我们各部门的业务都是服从于政治目的的，必须克服“经济部门不能结合政治”、“参加作中心工作是负担”等不正确的思想。
    经过学习文件联系检查自己的工作，大家初步认识到政治问题是每一个共产党员、每个革命干部要注意的头等重大问题。“不问政治的倾向”不只存在于经济部门，各部门都严重存在着，初步形成了不学习政治是耻辱的空气。在这个基础上，该县县委又布置了结合着学习党史，讨论与批判武训精神，继续检查与纠正不问政治的倾向。
