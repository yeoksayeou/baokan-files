Cooperative Purchase and Storage of Cotton in Various Parts of Hebei
　　Zheng Wu, Gao Shoulei
    Hebei Province's cooperatives have achieved considerable success in the purchase and storage of cotton. In the past, the province's cooperatives had either directly managed cotton or procured cotton for the state, accumulating significant experience in cotton procurement, along with organizational structures and facilities. Grassroots cooperatives in key cotton-producing counties possess cadres for inspection and storage, as well as the ability to organize the masses for processing. County cooperatives have equipment such as cotton gins, baling presses, and warehouses. Cotton purchasing has become a regular year-round business. After the task of purchasing and storing cotton was communicated, it immediately garnered the attention of cooperatives in various counties. Most cooperative cadres considered this work to be an important political task at present. Starting from June 3rd, they collaborated with Party, government leading organs, and the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company to conduct typical demonstration work in key grassroots cooperatives. During the demonstration work, the grassroots cooperatives, through general meetings of members or joint meetings of members' representatives and village government committees, clearly explained the methods and policies for purchasing and storing cotton, ignited everyone's patriotic enthusiasm, and called upon everyone to take the lead by selling or storing all their cotton with the cooperatives. Subsequently, they promoted overall progress through methods such as dividing into sections and groups, as well as individual mobilization. For example, the Shangquan Village Cooperative in Wu'an County purchased and stored more than 70,000 jin of cotton in nine days of typical demonstration work. County and district cadres in the county gained experience from this village, increased their confidence in completing the task, and created favorable conditions for the comprehensive launch of cotton purchasing and storage work.
  Taking the Lead in Selling the Cooperative's Existing Cotton to the State First
  Establishing Cotton Collection Stations in Most Primary Markets
    After the purchase and storage of cotton work was launched, the cooperatives first took the lead in selling the cotton previously stored within the cooperatives to the state. Cooperatives at all levels in Handan Prefecture sold a total of 370,000 jin of lint cotton, and cooperatives at all levels in Xingtai Prefecture sold a total of 240,000 jin of lint cotton. Cotton collection stations were established by county and grassroots cooperatives in most primary cotton markets throughout the province. Nangong County established 24 key cotton collection stations, 22 of which were managed by grassroots cooperatives, one by the county cooperative's goods and materials station, and one by the cotton collection team of the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company. The eight larger cotton markets in Wei County were all equipped with cotton collection stations established by cooperatives. Wu'an County established seven key cotton collection stations and conducted purchases through grassroots cooperatives. From July 1st to 13th, a total of 287,959 jin were collected, accounting for 76% of the county's total cotton collection.
  Combining with State-Owned Companies or Delivering Goods to Rural Areas
  Making Every Effort to Provide Necessary Supplies
    In order to do a good job in cotton purchasing, the cooperatives simultaneously paid attention to the issue of material supply. The specific practices included conducting supply through the chain operations of state-owned companies, or adopting the method of delivering goods to rural areas, making it convenient for cotton farmers to both sell cotton and buy goods. The cotton collection stations in Nangong County handled chain operations in conjunction with cotton yarn and fabric, grain, general merchandise, and local products companies. The materials needed by cotton farmers were transported to the cotton collection stations in advance, entrusted to the cooperatives for sales, and the cooperatives were paid a handling fee according to regulations, with settlements occurring every half month. This practice greatly increased the amount of cotton purchased. The entire county collected 570,000 jin of cotton in June, and more than 300,000 jin of cotton were collected from July 1st to 10th. The Weijiaqiao Cooperative in Shen County delivered goods to the countryside, purchasing 7,680 jin of seed cotton in six days. Dedishang Village is a market town. In the past, each market only collected about a hundred jin of cotton. After adopting the method of delivering goods to the countryside combined with publicity, more than 4,000 jin of seed cotton were collected in one day.
  Strengthening Publicity, Fair Grading, and Weighing
  Improved the Credit of Cooperatives Among the Masses
    In this cotton purchasing and storage work, the cooperatives fully utilized the spirit of serving members and the masses and strengthened publicity and education work, thereby expanding the influence of the cooperatives and establishing credibility. The cotton collection stations of grassroots cooperatives in Nangong County set up mat sheds, spread out mats, prepared boiling water, and entertained cotton farmers who sold cotton. Propaganda workers from the village branches were responsible for propaganda work, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm and initiative in selling cotton. Because cotton farmers had concerns about being downgraded and losing weight when selling cotton, the cooperatives made their best efforts to improve. In terms of inspection and grading, in addition to the doubled efforts of the cooperative's inspection and grading cadres, people with prestige and experience in the village were hired as grading committee members. Each time a grade was determined, the consent of the grading committee members and the cotton farmers had to be obtained before it was considered well-graded. In terms of weighing, it was guaranteed that there would be no difference of even one or two taels, and the steelyard was released to settle before being recognized by the cotton farmers. In this way, not only did the phenomenon of cotton farmers carrying back unsold cotton not occur, but also because the members and the masses trusted the cooperatives more, the cotton storage work was powerfully promoted, and the amount of cotton storage was increased. The Hechuntun Cooperative in Cheng'an County stored 14,000 jin of cotton in eight days from July 1st to 8th, accounting for 52% of the village's cotton collection of more than 27,200 jin during the same period.

    However, there are still some cooperatives that do not regard cotton purchase and storage as a major political task, and therefore do not pay close attention to this work; or they are hesitant to make progress on handling fees. Some are also competing with state-owned companies for market share in cotton purchasing. These deviations must be corrected in a timely manner so that the cooperatives can play a greater role in cotton purchasing and storage work.

　　河北各地合作社的购棉储棉工作
　　郑午　高寿雷
    河北省各地合作社在购棉、储棉工作中做出了不少成绩。该省的合作社过去曾自己经营棉花，或替国家收购棉花，对收购棉花有相当经验，并有一定的组织与设备。各重点产棉县的基层合作社，有验级、保管的干部及组织群众加工的力量。县合作社有轧花、榨包、仓库等设备。收棉已成为全年的经常业务。这次购棉储棉工作传达下来以后，立即引起各县合作社的重视，多数合作社干部都认为这一工作是当前的重要政治任务。从六月三日开始，即配合党、政领导机关及花纱布公司，在重点基层合作社做典型示范工作。在示范工作中，各基层合作社通过社员大会或社员代表与村政委员联席会议，讲清购棉、储棉的办法和政策，激发大家的爱国热情，号召大家积极带头，先把自己所有的棉花全部售给或储存到合作社；然后以分片、分组及个别动员等方式推动全面。如武安县上泉村合作社在九天的典型示范工作中，共购储棉花七万多斤；该县县、区干部在该村吸取了经验，增加了完成任务的信心，为购棉储棉工作的全面开展创造了有利条件。
  带头先把社内存棉卖给国家
  在大部初级市场遍设收棉站
    购棉、储棉工作展开后，合作社首先将社内原存棉花带头售给国家。邯郸专区各级合作社共售皮棉三十七万斤，邢台专区各级合作社共售皮棉二十四万斤。全省大部初级棉花市场，均由县及基层合作社设立了收棉站。南宫县设立重点收棉站二十四个，其中二十二个由基层合作社负责，一个由县社的合作货栈负责，一个由花纱布公司收棉小组负责。威县八个较大的棉花市场，均由合作社设立了收棉站。武安县设立七个重点收棉站，并通过基层合作社进行收购。自七月一日至十三日，共收二八七、九五九斤，占全县总收棉数的百分之七十六。
  与国营公司结合或送货下乡
  尽力办好必需物品供应工作
    为做好购棉工作，合作社同时注意了物资供应的问题。具体的做法，有的是结合着国营公司的连环业务进行供应，有的是采用送货下乡的办法，使棉农卖棉买物都便利。南宫县的收棉站，是结合着花纱布、粮食、百货、土产等公司办理的连环业务，事先把棉农所需要的物资运到收棉站，委托合作社代销，按规定给合作社以手续费，半个月结算一次。这一做法，使购棉数量大大增加。全县六月份一个月收棉五十七万斤，七月一日至十日即收棉三十余万斤。深县魏家桥合作社送货下乡，六天收购籽棉七千六百八十斤。大堤上村是个集市，过去每集收棉不过百余斤；采用送货下乡结合宣传的办法后，一天即收籽棉四千余斤。
  加强宣传工作公平评级过秤
  提高了合作社在群众中的信用
    合作社在这次购棉、储棉工作中，充分发挥了为社员、群众服务的精神，并加强了宣传教育工作，因而扩大了合作社的影响，树立了信用。南宫县各基层合作社的收花站，搭上席棚，铺好席子，预备开水，招待售棉农民；并由村支部宣传员担任宣传工作，鼓励大家售棉热情与积极性。由于棉农在售棉时存在着怕降级、怕亏秤的顾虑，合作社曾尽最大努力进行改进。在验级方面，除合作社的验级干部加倍努力外，并聘请村中有威信有经验的人担任评级委员。每次评定等级时，必须征得评级委员和棉农同意，才算评好。在过秤方面，保证不差一两，并且撤手定铊，经棉农承认后，才算决定。这样一来，不但没有棉农背回不卖的现象发生，并且由于社员及群众更加相信合作社，因而有力地推动了储棉工作，增加了储棉量。成安县河町村合作社在七月一日至八日的八天中，储棉一万四千斤，占该村同一期间收棉量二万七千二百多斤的百分之五十二。

    但是，现在也还有一部分合作社没有把购棉储棉工作当作重大的政治任务，因此对这一工作抓的不紧；或者是在手续费上打圈子，迟疑不前。也有的在购棉中与国营公司争夺市场。这些偏向，必须及时纠正，使合作社在购棉、储棉工作中起其更大的作用。
