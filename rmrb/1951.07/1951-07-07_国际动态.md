    Japanese People Unwilling to Be Sacrificed Again
    Two hundred disabled Japanese war veterans who participated in the Pacific War, wearing artificial limbs and patients' white clothes, recently held a peace parade on the streets of Tokyo. They held placards that read: "We oppose rearmament," "Don't drag our compatriots down the road we have traveled."
    The Japanese people are determined not to be sacrificed again, as the US-Japanese reactionaries want to follow the old path of Tojo.
    Not Working for Warmongers
    The French Labor Allocation Bureau recently sent a group of unemployed workers from Beauval, Somme province, to a construction site near Doingt. When the unemployed workers arrived at their destination, they discovered that they were to build a military base. They resolutely refused to work and demanded that they be sent back to Beauval. They said, "We will never participate in war preparations." Another group of unemployed workers from Amiens also demanded that they be sent back immediately. French workers would rather go hungry than work for warmongers.

    日本人民不愿再当牺牲品
    二百个参加过太平洋战争的日本残废退伍军人装着假臂假腿，穿着病人的白色衣服，最近在东京街道上举行拥护和平的游行。他们手里拿着标语牌，上面写道：“我们反对重新武装”，“不要把我们的同胞拖上我们所走过的路。”
    美日反动派要走东条的老路，日本人民决不愿再当牺牲品。
    不为战争贩子服务
    法国劳力分配局最近在索姆省白维尔地方把一批失业工人送到多兰附近的建筑工地去。这批失业工人到了目的地后，发觉他们要建筑的是军事基地，他们坚决拒绝工作，要求把他们送回白维尔。他们说：“我们决不参加战争准备”。另一批从亚眠去的失业工人也要求立刻把他们送回去。法国工人情愿饿肚子，也不为战争贩子服务。
