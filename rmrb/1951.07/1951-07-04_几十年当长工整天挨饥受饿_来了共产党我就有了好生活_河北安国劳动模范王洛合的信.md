　　For Decades I Toiled as a Hired Hand, Constantly Hungry and Cold
    Since the Communists Came, I Have a Good Life
     ——Letter from Wang Luohe, Labor Model of Anguo, Hebei

Respected Chairman Mao:

During the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, I thought of all the suffering I endured in the dark society under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and also of the happy life I now have under the leadership of the Communist Party. Only with the wise leadership of the Communist Party and you can we have the good days we have today. I will never forget this.

I am almost sixty-five years old this year. Since I was nineteen, I have been working as a long-term hired hand for landlords. While working, I spent my days constantly hungry and cold, never wearing a new piece of clothing. Every day I lived in the landlord's cowshed, working from morning to night without a moment's rest. Sometimes I was even scolded by the rich. All the labor and harvest went to them. In the old society, there was truly no way for us to survive!

Since the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, after the Communist Party established anti-Japanese base areas here, my life has become better day by day. In 1937, I joined the Communist Party of China. I was elected village head and director of the cooperative in my village. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government, I actively engaged in production, organized several mutual aid teams and sideline production teams, and implemented labor exchange and mutual assistance. With everyone's mutual help, our lives became more prosperous year by year. My family built eight new brick houses, bought a large mule, a new cart, and many pieces of furniture. In the spring of 1943, I was elected a special-class labor hero of the border region. At the border region's hero congress, I was given a big red flower and received the respect of the people, which made me feel immensely honored. Who gave me this honor? Wasn't it the Communist Party? As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Party today, in addition to expressing my gratitude to the Party, I also pledge to the Party: I am determined to make the greatest effort to increase production even more. I will apply forty-five cartloads of fertilizer to each mu of land, and strive to cultivate three times and weed seven times for all crops. My family has a total of ten mu of land, and the average yield of various crops will reach approximately 1,500 jin of grain per mu (including tobacco, garlic, onions, vegetables, millet, sorghum, wheat, etc., all converted).

I have reorganized the agricultural mutual aid team and sideline production team that I lead. I will definitely make my increased production income this year exceed that of previous years. I will save more grain to support our army. In the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and in the economic construction of the motherland, I will contribute everything I have and complete the tasks given to me by the Party. Only in this way can I be worthy of the Party and worthy of you. I will donate 5,000 jin of millet obtained from increased production in agriculture and sideline production for the volunteer army to purchase airplanes and artillery; I will also donate all the increased production every year. Long live the Communist Party! I wish you eternal joy and good health!

### 几十年当长工整天挨饥受饿  来了共产党我就有了好生活——河北安国劳动模范王洛合的信

　　几十年当长工整天挨饥受饿
    来了共产党我就有了好生活
     ——河北安国劳动模范王洛合的信敬爱的毛主席：
    在纪念中国共产党成立三十周年这个伟大的节日的时候，我就想到过去在蒋匪国民党统治时期那种黑暗的社会里所受到的一切痛苦，又想到现在在共产党的领导之下的美满生活。有共产党和你的英明领导，我们才能有今天的好日子。这是我永远不会忘记的。
    我今年已是快六十五岁的人了。我自十九岁以后，即给地主家扛长活。在扛活当中，整天挨饥受饿的度日，没有穿过一件新衣服。每日里住在地主的牛棚里，从白天到夜晚，没有歇一时的工夫。有时还让财主们骂。劳来劳去，全部收获归了他们。旧社会里，真是没有我们的活路之处呀！
    自抗日战争开始以后，共产党在我们这里建立起抗日根据地，我的日子才一天比一天的强起来。在一九三七年，我参加了中国共产党。我曾在本村当选了村长、合作社主任。在共产党和政府的领导下，我自己积极生产，组织起来了几个互助组和副业组，实行了拨工互助。在大家互相的帮助之下，我们的生活一年比一年富裕起来。我家盖上了八间新砖房，买了一头大骡子，买了一辆新车和许多家具。在一九四三年春天，我当选了边区的特等劳动英雄。在边区的群英大会上，还戴上了大红花，受到了人民的尊敬，使我感到无上的光荣。这个光荣是谁给的呢？还不是共产党吗？当今天纪念党的三十周年纪念日的时候，我除表示向党感激外，并向党宣誓：我决心以最大的努力，更多地增加生产。每亩地要施肥四十五车，各种农作物要平均作到耕三遍锄七遍。我家共地十亩，各种农作物的收获平均每亩要达到折谷子一千五百斤左右（烟、蒜、葱、菜、谷子、高粱、小麦等物均折合在内）。
    我把我领导的农业互助组和副业组重新作了整理。一定将我今年的增产收入超过往年。要多节余粮食，支援咱们的军队。在抗美援朝与祖国的经济建设中，贡献出自己的一切，完成党给予的任务。这样我才对得起党，对得起您。我把在农副业增产中得到的五千斤小米捐献出来给志愿军作购买飞机大炮之用；我并要把每年增产的全部捐出。共产党万岁！祝你精神永远愉快，身体健康！
