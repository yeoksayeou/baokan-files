Following the Road of Dimitrov
    Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Bulgaria, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party
    [Editor's Note] Today is the second anniversary of the death of Comrade Dimitrov. Comrade Damyanov, Member the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian People's Assembly, specially wrote an article for this newspaper entitled "Following the Road of Dimitrov" to commemorate the death of this leader of the Bulgarian people and outstanding leader of the international workers' movement.

            The Fighting Leader of the Working Class and the Party

    Two years have passed since that memorable and sorrowful day when our Party and all the working people of our country bid farewell to the greatest son of the motherland, to our beloved teacher and leader, to our dear and immortal Dimitrov.

    After Dimitrov's death, the Bulgarian working class and the Bulgarian Communist Party lost their fighting leader, their beloved teacher, the founder and leader of the Fatherland Front, the ardent inspirer and organizer of all our victories, and the tireless builder of our People's Republic.

    Dimitrov faithfully dedicated all his strength and talent, all his energy, all his revolutionary enthusiasm, and his entire life to the cause of the working class and working people all over the world, and to the people of his own country.

    Chervenkov said: "Dimitrov faithfully and loyally served the working class of his country and the working people of the world with all his life until his last breath, without reservation. He had no other interests than the interests of the people; he had no other life than the life of struggling for the victory of the Party, the working class, and socialism."

    He participated in the revolutionary movement in his early years, won the love of revolutionary workers with his self-sacrificing struggle, and became a leader of the trade union movement. From 1906 to 1923, Dimitrov had been the leader of the General Trade Union of Bulgaria. After joining the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party in 1902, he stood on the side of revolutionary Marxists and actively fought against reformism.

    At the age of eighteen, he led the trade union movement, and two years later he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the "Tesnyak" Socialist Party, and together with Blagoev, Kirov, and Kolarov, he adhered to the class stance of the Party and the working class, carried out an irreconcilable struggle against the "Obshchedek" – the opportunist faction of Bulgaria, and educated the Party and the working class to treat the exploiters and parasites with an irreconcilable spirit. When Dimitrov served as the secretary of the Revolutionary Trade Union Federation, he led more than 680 strikes of the working class from 1908 to 1912 alone, and became a beloved leader of the Belnik miners. He grew and tempered into a proletarian revolutionary in the cruel and uncompromising class struggle against the Bulgarian bourgeoisie and its tool – the Pan-Socialist Party. Dimitrov led the famous railway workers' strike in 1919-1920, demonstrating the spirit of proletarian heroism during the strike. As a leader of strikes and demonstrations, his personal bravery, his moving words and iron logic of the people's horn inspired the workers and laborers to fight against the cruel exploitation and deception of the capitalists. Dimitrov overcame all obstacles with extraordinary revolutionary enthusiasm and led the Bulgarian working class and laborers against the bourgeoisie, against despotism, and against imperialist wars with amazing courage. His unyielding struggle against bourgeois nationalism and Greater Bulgarian nationalism for many years educated the Party and the working class, and carried out a ruthless and irreconcilable struggle against the traitors of the great cause of proletarian internationalism and the fundamental interests of the people (i.e., the right-wing Social Democrats in various countries of Western Europe and the Balkan Tito elements).

    In the glorious September Uprising of 1923, organized and led by Dimitrov and his loyal comrade Kolarov, the qualities of Dimitrov as a wise leader and organizer of the masses, a far-sighted politician, and a brave anti-fascist fighter were most clearly manifested. This uprising laid an unshakable foundation for the fighting alliance of the working class and laboring peasants in our country. After the uprising was suppressed, Dimitrov had to live abroad and live the life of a professional revolutionary.

            An Outstanding Activist of the International Workers' Movement

    Dimitrov, an outstanding Marxist, Leninist, and close comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin, was an outstanding activist of the international workers' movement. During the Leipzig trial, he was the first person to deliver a fatal blow to the attacking German fascism, and his name became a symbol of the anti-fascist struggle all over the world. He was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist International, became an ardent Stalinist leader of the international proletarian struggle, helped the Communist Parties of various countries expand and consolidate their ties with the masses, and established a united front of working people in the anti-fascist struggle.

    Dimitrov paid special attention to the Bolshevization of our Party, closely studying the CPSU, Lenin, and Stalin. He "built and educated the Party into a battle vanguard of the working class that is tested in the class struggle, irreconcilable to all and any enemies of the people, steel-like in its unity, sworn to proletarian internationalism, and Marxist-Leninist, capable of uniting the working people under its banner and successfully guiding them to fight for the liberation from bourgeois exploitation and the victory of socialism." (Chervenkov) Under his leadership, the Bulgarian Communist Party united all patriots and democratic forces under the banner of the Fatherland Front to fight against the fascist aggressors and their Bulgarian henchmen.

    He led the Bulgarian Communist Party and all Bulgarian patriots to fight against German fascists and their lackeys. He resolutely led our people, relying on the brilliant victory of the Soviet army, to carry out the armed uprising of September 9, 1944. After the heroic Soviet army liberated our country, Dimitrov, with the profound wisdom of a politician, with iron will and fortitude, implemented the necessary measures to turn the political, economic, and cultural life of the country to the socialist path.

    Dimitrov, with extraordinary depth and insight, skillfully applied the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and the rich experience of the CPSU (B) to the conditions of our people's democracy, Dimitrov led the construction of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

    Under his leadership, our country implemented basic reforms – the nationalization of industry, enterprises, banks, and transportation. This was "the most important revolutionary measure in the national economy, which finally determined our path to planned socialist development." (Dimitrov)

    These and other basic reforms are the basis of Dimitrov's constitutional clauses. This constitution guarantees that all citizens are equal before the law regardless of nationality, gender, and belief; guarantees the rights to work, rest, and education, and many other interests of workers. Under the leadership of Dimitrov, Bulgaria consolidated its friendship with the great Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, took its rightful place in the family of freedom-loving and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, and became an active factor in the struggle against war provocateurs and the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    While serving as the General Secretary of the Communist International, Dimitrov worked tirelessly under the leadership of the great Stalin. In order to establish a proletarian united front in the international workers' movement, and to cultivate Lenin-Stalinist cadres in various brotherly communist parties, he launched a boiling activity during the Second World War to mobilize the progressive forces of the world for armed struggle against the German fascist aggressors. Dimitrov won the love of working people all over the world for his tireless and self-sacrificing activities in the ranks of the international workers' movement, his heroic actions during the Leipzig trial, and his ardent struggle against fascism and war. Therefore, his death was a major loss to the international workers' movement, to progressive humanity all over the world, and to all fighters for lasting peace and people's democracy.

            The Guide for Building a Socialist Country

    Dimitrov skillfully applied Marxist-Leninist principles to the construction of a socialist society in our country. He taught that the development of our country is inextricably linked with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union is the only and best example for our country to build a socialist society.

    Dimitrov said: "The smooth construction of our socialist society is only possible with the comprehensive application of the rich experience of the CPSU (B) and the Soviet people, and with the selfless and fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union."

    In his report to the Fifth Congress of the Party, Dimitrov clearly expounded the general line of the Party in its struggle to build a socialist society in Bulgaria.

    Dimitrov taught that it is not enough to transform national industry to turn Bulgaria from a backward agricultural country into an industrial and agricultural country. "In order to rapidly eliminate the economic backwardness of our country and to transform it into an industrial and agricultural country in a short period of time, it is also necessary to rapidly develop our new productive forces. And this is only possible by embarking on the road of national socialist industrialization and electrification."

    Dimitrov clearly pointed out what kind of mutual relationship should exist between industry and agriculture under the conditions of people's democracy. Dimitrov said: "It is impossible to establish a people's democratic regime and socialist construction on two different foundations for a long time – on the basis of large unified socialist industry and the decentralized and backward small-commodity rural economy. It is necessary to gradually but systematically and resolutely transform agriculture to a new technical basis and a large production basis through the collectivization of individual agriculture and its union into large mechanized cooperative farms."

    Dimitrov always emphasized the need to strengthen the fighting alliance of the working class and laboring peasants under the leadership of the working class.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Chervenkov, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian working people, following Dimitrov's instructions on building a socialist society in our country, relying on the support and assistance of the Soviet Union, and relying on the mutual assistance of the People's Democratic countries, are firmly and confidently building the economic and cultural foundation of a socialist society in our country smoothly.

    Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party headed by Chervenkov, the Bulgarian people, following Dimitrov's instructions on eliminating the economic backwardness of our country and establishing our own socialist industry in a short period of time, have made great achievements in industry. Our heroic working class has absorbed the experience of Soviet workers and famous Soviet Stakhanovites, and applied this experience and tested socialist methods to complete the 1950 industrial plan by 100.3 percent. At the end of 1950, our industrial production tripled the pre-war output. Our Party is fulfilling Dimitrov's instructions on the socialist transformation of agriculture, and is striving to consolidate labor cooperative farms and transform them into model cooperative economies.

    Dimitrov very emphatically reminded the Communist Party members engaged in agricultural work that Stalin's principle of voluntariness must be resolutely observed under collectivization. He tirelessly emphasized the harm of violating this principle and the need to actively strive to abide by it. The Central Committee of the Party is implementing Dimitrov's instructions in its decisions. For example, the decisions of the plenary sessions in June 1949 and October 1950, such as the resolution of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party on the distortion of policies in the Kurskaya and Tetevenskaya regions, and many other decisions eliminated and eradicated the distortions of the Party's rural policies with Dimitrov's irreconcilability. These distortions were the violation of the principle of voluntariness in the establishment of labor cooperative farms, the adoption of coercive methods, and the violation of our people's democratic laws.

    While struggling to eliminate the distortion of policies, the Party and the people's regime are carrying out a relentless struggle against the sabotage and anti-people activities of rich peasants and hostile elements, and are striving to consolidate labor cooperative farms.

    Accelerating the socialist construction of our country, the socialist reorganization of agriculture, and all other measures of the people's regime are now consolidating and expanding the economic foundation of the alliance between the working class and the working people. This alliance was founded by Dimitrov, and it has been strongly developed in more than 20 years of cruel struggle against fascism.

    Dimitrov's will – to carry out a relentless struggle against bourgeois ideology and traditions in science and culture, and to build a new Bulgarian culture and new science with national form and socialist content with all our strength – we are steadily fulfilling it while learning from Soviet science and culture. The Bulgarian Communist Party and Comrade Chervenkov are concerned about the prosperity of our science and culture, and concerned about the political education and culture of our working people.

    All these are the result of the correct and firm implementation of the general line of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which was put forward by Dimitrov at the Fifth Party Congress. At the same time, it is also the result of the heroic efforts of the working class and all the working people under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party headed by Comrade Chervenkov.

            Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship – A Sacred Legacy Left to the People

    Dimitrov emphasized that only with the support of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of the People's Democratic countries can the consolidation and development of our People's Democratic countries and the construction of socialism be possible. Without the friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people can neither master their own destiny nor successfully build socialism and maintain our freedom and national independence.

    Our friendship with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is a source of creativity that enables us to build socialism faster. After being recognized by the broad masses of the people, this becomes the driving force for our development.

    Our working people value and consolidate Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. Bulgarian-Soviet friendship is the pillar of the most precious aspirations of our people, just as Dimitrov said: "For the independence and prosperity of the Bulgarian nation, our sincere friendship with the Soviet Union is as necessary as the sun and air to any living thing, and there is no and cannot be a patriotic Bulgarian who is not deeply convinced of this."

    The Bulgarian people will always be grateful to the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B), and Comrade Stalin himself for their timely economic, political, and cultural assistance to us in the past and present. Because of this assistance, we have created all the conditions for our country to develop towards the socialist road.

    Love and fraternal closeness to the Soviet Union and the great Comrade Stalin inspire and organize our working people to fight for peace and socialism.

    The growth and consolidation of Bulgarian-Soviet friendship – this is the cordial and sacred will of our deceased leader and teacher Dimitrov. We will never violate this will.

    Our foreign policy is a policy of peace, a policy of fraternal friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. It is also a policy of actively opposing the provocateurs of new wars and fighting for the defense of peace.

    As early as the Fifth Party Congress in 1948, Dimitrov had exposed that the American and British imperialism were the provocateurs of new wars, and emphasized the important role played by the Soviet Union in defending the cause of peace. He said: "The international prestige and power of the Soviet Union have grown immeasurably... The forces of socialism and democracy are invincible. In international politics, the Soviet Union has become a decisive factor, and it has become a fortress for peace and the security of all nations, as well as their free development along the path of progress and true democracy. The Soviet Union, which leads the worldwide anti-imperialist united front, is an insurmountable obstacle to the international reactionaries who want to realize their dark conspiracy – to plunge the people into a new world war."

    "The Soviet Union has given a decisive blow to the imperialists' attempt to intimidate the people with atomic weapons. Relying on its growing economic and political power, relying on its invincible army, and relying on the wholehearted support of the workers and laborers all over the world who are concerned about maintaining peace, the Soviet Union is implementing its tested policy of peace and friendly cooperation among nations. The plans of the aggressors and new war provocateurs will inevitably go bankrupt."

    "The era when the people were ignorant and helpless under the rule of capitalist and autocratic ruling groups has passed. The peace-loving people all over the world are more resolutely mobilizing their forces to defend peace, democracy, and world culture; the increasingly clear worldwide anti-imperialist front, led by the Soviet Union, is growing stronger. Today, when American imperialism threatens peace with atomic bombs and shamelessly boasts that these atomic bombs can eliminate millions of people and destroy entire countries and regions, all people regard the Soviet Union as the main defender of world peace and the protector of civilization from capitalist destruction."

    "Not only the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, but also the vast majority of the people in capitalist countries and colonies are united in the peace front."

            Praise for the Heroic Struggle of the Chinese People

    "The anti-imperialist united front in the Far East has expanded after the war, and now there are the people of Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma and other colonies who are fighting for their national independence in this front."

    "The Chinese people's long, strong and heroic struggle for their independence against imperialism and its reactionary agents in China, which it bought off, is of great significance to the balance of power between the two camps."

    "The Chinese events are a huge factor that has confused and overturned the crazy American imperialist plans... The anti-imperialist forces of the world's people's masses, with the fraternal state of the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of various countries as the vanguard, can frustrate the aggressive imperialist war-mongering conspiracies, thereby ensuring lasting peace throughout the world."

    The People's Republic of Bulgaria faithfully abides by these instructions of its founder Dimitrov. It firmly stands in the camp of peace, democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, and fully defends world peace. The fact that 5,627,000 people signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace treaty among the five great powers shows the hatred of our working people for the American and British new war-mongers and their tools in the Balkans – the Tito fascist group, the Greek royalist fascists and the Turkish reactionaries. Every patriotic man and woman in Bulgaria deeply remembers the teachings of his teacher Dimitrov in his heart: to safeguard and defend the national independence and state sovereignty of our motherland with all our strength, free from any imperialist aggression. The attempts of the enemies of our people to send spies and saboteurs through our borders are being crushed by our glorious border guards with the active assistance of the people in the border areas.

    Under the leadership of Dimitrov, under the constant teachings of the CPSU (B) and the great Stalin, our Party has grown into a Bolshevik party armed with the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

            The Party Leads the People to Great Victories

    In the two years since Dimitrov's death, the Party, under the leadership of Comrade Chervenkov, is advancing along the path of building socialism as he planned, and is achieving increasingly rapid victories.

    Dimitrov taught us to maintain the unity of the Party, the purity of the Party, and its iron discipline like protecting our eyes, and to constantly strengthen our revolutionary vigilance.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Chervenkov, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party exposed and ruthlessly crushed the Traikov Kostovsky gang – the agents of imperialism – who had invaded the Party and government agencies and built a devil's lair there. The Party and the government continue to uncover and eliminate the remnants of these foreign agents with the same severity.

    The Party is more closely united around the Central Committee, enhances its revolutionary vigilance, and treats shortcomings and mistakes and those who have shortcomings and mistakes with a more irreconcilable attitude. All the working people in our country are more firmly united around the Communist Party, and support its policies of building socialism, its peace policy, and its policy of friendship with the great Soviet Union with greater loyalty.

    Dimitrov tirelessly taught the Party to boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and to educate the Party with an irreconcilable spirit towards the shortcomings in our work. He relentlessly denounced the arbitrariness of all kinds of "adults and gentlemen" and severely condemned the use of command methods within the Party. In his conclusion at the Fifth Party Congress, he said: "For a true Communist Party member, the greatest wisdom lies in admitting and realizing the mistakes made in time honestly and sincerely, boldly exposing the causes of this mistake, and resolutely, quickly, and ruthlessly eliminating and correcting this mistake."

    Under the leadership of Chervenkov, criticism and self-criticism, which is the driving force of our development, is being carried out more actively in our Party. The Party pays special attention to the criticism of grassroots organizations. Comrade Chervenkov warmly called on Party members, the working class, and all working people to bravely carry out criticism: "Criticize! Bravely and openly criticize the faults and shortcomings in our work! Don't be afraid to criticize! Don't hesitate to criticize because you can't express your ideas accurately!"

            The Bulgarian People are Determined to Safeguard the Cause of Peace

    Our Party, which was educated by Dimitrov, a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin, and his successor Chervenkov, is always faithful to proletarian internationalism, and educates all working people in the spirit of international solidarity and friendship with the people of all countries.

    Our people stand firmly in the camp of peace and democracy, and are struggling for the maintenance of peace in its front ranks. Our people salute the heroic struggle of the Korean people, who are fighting together with the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers for the freedom and independence of their motherland, against the aggression of the American imperialist bandits. Our people salute the great Chinese people, who are carrying out extensive peaceful construction and building a new life under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    The Bulgarian working people, fulfilling Dimitrov's legacy and Stalin's instructions that "if the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated," are actively participating in the great struggle of the people of all countries to strive for peace. The movement to strive for peace is expanding more and more greatly in our country.

    The great cause for which Dimitrov worked for his entire life and contributed all his strength is now in the hands of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which is led by Comrade Chervenkov, who was cultivated and tempered by him and who is his loyal successor. The Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and headed by Comrade Chervenkov, are relying on the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, and are unswervingly fulfilling the legacy of their beloved teacher and leader, building our socialism.

    Our lofty and dear teacher and leader Dimitrov has only died physically. His cause is still alive and is being victorious. He lives in the steel-like ranks of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which he built and cultivated, he lives in the People's Democratic country, which he founded, he lives in the heroic working class, he lives in the laboring peasants and the people's intellectuals. He lives in the excellent youth of our country. He lives in the hearts of every sincere patriot. These patriots are building a new, most valuable and magnificent Dimitrov monument, to which he dedicated his beautiful life - a socialist society.

    Dimitrov is flesh and blood with the working people of our country, with the magnificent socialist construction of our country.

    Let the bright memory of our dear teacher and leader - the immortal Dimitrov live forever!

    Dimitrov is immortal!

    Develop and consolidate the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party headed by the outstanding leader and successor of Dimitrov's cause, Comrade Chervenkov!

    Develop and consolidate the camp of peace, democracy and socialism headed by the Soviet Union!

    Develop and consolidate Bulgarian-Soviet friendship - the guarantee of our national independence!

    Long live our teacher and leader, the teacher of all progressive humanity, Stalin!

                                 (The intertitles in the text are added by the editor of this newspaper)

　　遵循着季米特洛夫的道路
    保加利亚人民议会主席团主席
    保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员  达米扬诺夫
    【编者按】今天是季米特洛夫同志逝世两周年纪念日。保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员、保加利亚人民议会主席团主席达米扬诺夫特为本报撰《遵循着季米特洛夫的道路走》一文，以纪念这位保加利亚人民领袖和国际工人运动杰出领袖的逝世。
            工人阶级和党的战斗的领袖
    从我党和我国一切劳动者向祖国最伟大的儿子、向我们爱戴的导师和领袖、向我们亲爱和不朽的季米特洛夫告别的那个令人怀念与哀悼的日子以来，已经过了两年。
    季米特洛夫逝世后，保加利亚工人阶级和保加利亚共产党失去了自己战斗的领袖，自己爱戴的导师，祖国战线的奠基人和领导者，我们一切胜利的热烈的鼓舞者和组织者，我们人民共和国的不倦的建设者。
    季米特洛夫把自己的全部力量和才能、全部精力、全部革命热情、全部生命，无遗留地为全世界工人阶级和劳动者的事业，为本国的人民而忠实地服务。
    契尔文科夫说过：“季米特洛夫把自己全部生命直到最后一息，无遗留地为本国工人阶级和全世界劳动者忠实与忠诚地服务。他除了人民的利益以外，没有任何别的利益；他除了为党、为工人阶级、为社会主义的胜利斗争的生命以外，没有别的生命。”
    他早年参加革命运动，以他自我牺牲的斗争获得了革命工人的热爱，成为职工运动的领导人；从一九○六年到一九二三年，季米特洛夫就一直是全保加利亚总工会的领导者。他在一九○二年参加保加利亚社会民主党以后，就站在革命的马克思主义者方面，对改良主义进行积极的斗争。
    他十八岁时领导职工运动，两年后被选为“捷斯涅克”社会主义者党的中央委员，并且和布拉哥也夫、基洛夫和科拉罗夫一起坚持党和工人阶级的阶级立场，与“奥布世捷克”——保加利亚的机会主义派别，进行不调和的斗争，教育党和工人阶级以不调和的精神对待剥削者、寄生虫。季米特洛夫任革命职工联合会联盟书记的时候，仅仅从一九○八年到一九一二年，就领导了六百八十多次工人阶级罢工，并成为贝尔尼克矿工爱戴的领袖。他在与保加利亚资产阶级及其工具——泛社会主义党进行残酷的不妥协的阶级斗争中，成长和锻炼成为无产阶级革命家。季米特洛夫领导一九一九——一九二○年出名的铁路工人罢工，在罢工时表现了无产阶级英雄主义的精神。作为罢工和游行示威的领导者，他个人的勇敢，他这人民号角的感人的话语和铁一般的逻辑，鼓舞了工人和劳动者去和资本家残忍的剥削和愚弄进行斗争。季米特洛夫以非凡的革命热情克服一切阻碍，以惊人的勇敢领导保加利亚工人阶级和劳动者反对资产阶级、反对专制主义、反对帝国主义战争。他对资产阶级民族主义和大保加利亚民族主义多年来不屈不挠的斗争，教育了党和工人阶级，对无产阶级国际主义的伟大事业与人民的根本利益的叛徒们（即现在西欧各国的右派社会党人和巴尔干铁托分子）进行无情的、不调和的斗争。
    在季米特洛夫及其忠实战友科拉罗夫所组织和领导的光荣的一九二三年九月起义中，最明显地表现出季米特洛夫作为群众的英明领导者和组织者、有远见的政治家和反法西斯主义的勇敢战士的品质。这次起义打下了我国工人阶级与劳动农民战斗联盟的不可动摇的基础。在起义被镇压后，季米特洛夫不得不侨居国外，过着职业革命者的生活。
            国际工人运动的出色活动家
    卓越的马克思主义者、列宁主义者和伟大斯大林的亲近战友季米特洛夫，是国际工人运动的出色活动家。在莱比锡审讯时，他第一个人给正在进攻的德国法西斯主义以致命的打击，他的名字成了全世界反法西斯反战斗争的象征。他被选为共产国际总书记，成了无产阶级国际斗争的热烈的斯大林式的领导人，帮助各国共产党扩大和巩固与群众的联系，建立了劳动者在反法西斯主义斗争中的统一战线。
    季米特洛夫特别注意我党的布尔塞维克化，紧密地向联共、向列宁和斯大林学习，他“把党建立和教育成为在阶级斗争中经得住考验的、对一切和任何人民的敌人不调和的、在其统一中是钢铁般的、誓死忠于无产阶级国际主义的、马克思列宁主义的工人阶级的战斗先锋队，能够把劳动者团结在自己的旗帜下和成功地引导他们为解脱资产阶级剥削、为社会主义胜利而斗争。”（契尔文科夫）在他的领导下，保共在祖国战线的旗帜下团结了一切爱国主义者和民主力量，对法西斯侵略者及其保加利亚走卒作斗争。
    他领导保共和一切保加利亚爱国主义者对德国法西斯及其奴才作斗争。他坚决领导我们人民，依靠苏军辉煌的胜利，进行了一九四四年九月九日的武装起义。在英勇的苏军解放我们祖国后，季米特洛夫以政治家的深刻的英明，以铁的意志和坚强性，实行了使国家政治经济和文化生活转向社会主义轨道去的必要措施。
    季米特洛夫以非常的深刻性和洞察力，把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说和联共（布）党的丰富经验能干地运用到本国人民民主主义的条件中去，季米特洛夫领导了保加利亚人民共和国的建设。
    在他的领导下，我国实行了基本的改革——工业、企业、银行、运输的国有化，这是“国民经济方面最重要的革命措施，它最后确定了我们有计划地走向社会主义发展的道路。”（季米特洛夫）
    这些及其他基本改革是季米特洛夫宪法条款的基础。这宪法保证一切公民不分民族、性别和信仰，在法律上是平等的；保证劳动、休息和受教育权利及许多其他劳动者的利益。在季米特洛夫的领导下，保加利亚与伟大的苏联和人民民主国家巩固了友谊，它在以苏联为首的爱好自由和民主的家庭里占了应有的地位，并成为对战争挑拨者的斗争、为争取和平民主和社会主义斗争的积极因素。
    在担任共产国际总书记时，季米特洛夫在伟大的斯大林的领导下不倦地工作。为了在国际工人运动中建立无产阶级统一战线，为了在各兄弟共产党中培养列宁斯大林式的干部，在第二次世界大战年代，他展开了沸腾的活动，为动员全世界进步力量对德国法西斯侵略者作武装斗争。季米特洛夫在国际工人运动队伍中用他的不倦的和自我牺牲的活动，用莱比锡审判时的英勇行动，用他的反对法西斯主义和战争的热烈斗争，博得了全世界劳动者的爱戴。因此他的逝世对国际工人运动、对全世界进步人类、对一切争取持久和平和人民民主的战士，是一个重大损失。
            建设社会主义国家的指导者
    季米特洛夫能干地运用了马克思列宁主义原理来在我国建设社会主义社会。他教导说，我国的发展与苏联不可分离地联系着，苏联是我国建设社会主义社会唯一的、最好的榜样。
    季米特洛夫说：“我们社会主义社会的顺利建设，只有在全面地运用联共（布）党和苏联人民的丰富经验，在苏联的大公无私的兄弟般的帮助下，才有可能。”
    季米特洛夫在党的第五次代表大会上的报告中，明确地阐明了党为建设保加利亚社会主义社会而斗争的总路线。
    季米特洛夫教导说，仅仅改造民族工业还不足以把保加利亚从落后的农业国变成为工业国兼农业国，“为迅速消灭我国的经济落后，为使它短期间变为工业国兼农业国，还必须迅速地发展我国新的生产力。而这只有走向国家社会主义工业化和电气化的道路，才有可能。”
    季米特洛夫明确地指出了在人民民主的条件下，工业与农业之间应有怎样的互相关系。季米特洛夫说：“不能够在很长时期在两个不同基础上——在大的统一的社会主义的工业的基础上和分散的落后的小商品农村经济基础上——建立人民民主政权和社会主义建设，必须逐渐但有系统和坚决地经过个体农业的合作化及其联合为大的机械化的合作农场，把农业转到新的技术基础，转到大的生产基础上去。”
    季米特洛夫总是着重指出必须加强在工人阶级领导下的工人阶级和劳动农民的战斗联盟。
    保共和保加利亚劳动人民，在契尔文科夫同志领导下，遵循着季米特洛夫关于在我国建设社会主义社会的指示，依靠苏联的支持和援助，依靠人民民主国家的互助，坚强地有信心地在我国顺利地建设社会主义社会的经济和文化基础。
    保加利亚人民在以契尔文科夫为首的保加利亚共产党的领导下，遵循着季米特洛夫关于为消灭我国经济的落后并在短期内创立自己的社会主义工业的指示，在工业方面取得了巨大的成就。我国英勇的工人阶级吸取了苏联工人、著名苏联斯塔哈诺夫者的经验，运用这个经验和经过考验的社会主义方法，完成了一九五零年工业计划的百分之一百点三。一九五○年底我们工业生产了三倍于战前的产量。我们党完成着季米特洛夫关于农业社会主义改造的指示，为巩固劳动合作农场、为转变它们为模范的合作经济而斗争。
    季米特洛夫非常着重地提醒做农业工作的共产党员说，在合作化下必须坚决遵守斯大林的自愿原则。他不倦地强调，破坏这个原则的害处和必须为遵守它而进行积极斗争。党中央委员会在自己的决定中执行着季米特洛夫的指示。例如，一九四九年六月全体会议和一九五○年十月全体会议的决定，又如保共中央关于库尔斯卡雅县和捷捷文斯卡雅县歪曲政策的决议，以及其他许多决定中以季米特洛夫的不调和性消灭和铲除对党在农村政策的歪曲。这些歪曲就是在建立劳动合作农场时破坏自愿原则，采用强迫方法，就是破坏我们人民民主的法律。
    为铲除歪曲政策而斗争时，党和人民政权对富农和敌对分子们的破坏与反人民活动进行着无情的斗争，为巩固劳动合作农场而斗争。
    加速我国社会主义的建设，农业的社会主义改组，以及人民政权所有其他措施，现时都是巩固和扩大着工人阶级与劳动人民联盟的经济基础。这个联盟是季米特洛夫创立的，它在二十多年对法西斯主义的残酷斗争中坚强地发展了。
    季米特洛夫的遗嘱——对根绝科学与文化中的资产阶级思想意识和传统进行无情斗争，并且全力建设民族形式、社会主义内容的新的保加利亚文化和新的科学——我们在学习苏联的科学和文化时稳步地完成着。保共和契尔文科夫同志关心着我们科学和文化的繁荣，关心着我国劳动人民的政治教育和文化。
    所有这些都是正确坚决推行保共总路线的结果，这总路线是季米特洛夫在五次党代表大会上提出的。同时也是在以契尔文科夫同志为首的保共领导下工人阶级与全体劳动人民英雄地努力的结果。
            保苏友好——留给人民的神圣遗嘱
    季米特洛夫着重指出，只有在苏联支持下，在各人民民主国家合作下，我们人民民主国家的巩固与发展以及社会主义的建设才有可能。如果没有与伟大苏联的友好和联盟，保加利亚人民既不能把自己命运掌握在自己手中，也不能顺利地建设社会主义和保持我们的自由和民族独立。
    我们与苏联以及人民民主国家的友谊是使我们能够更快地建设社会主义的创造力的源泉。在被广大人民群众认识后，这就变为我们发展的动力。
    我国劳动人民重视和巩固保苏友好。保苏友好——这是我们人民最宝贵愿望的支柱，正像季米特洛夫所说：“为了保加利亚民族的独立和繁荣，我们与苏联的真诚友谊如同太阳和空气对任何生物那样需要，没有也不可能有爱祖国的保加利亚人不这样深信的。”
    保加利亚人民将永远感谢苏联、苏联共产党（布）及斯大林同志本人过去现在对我们及时的经济政治和文化的帮助。由于这个帮助我们创立了使我们国家向社会主义道路发展的所有条件。
    对苏联和伟大斯大林同志的爱戴和兄弟般的亲密，鼓舞着和组织着我国劳动人民为和平和社会主义而斗争。
    保苏友谊的成长和巩固——这是我们已故领袖和导师季米特洛夫的亲切和神圣的遗嘱。我们永不违背这个遗嘱。
    我们的对外政策是和平的政策，是和苏联与人民民主国家的人民兄弟友好的政策。这也是积极反对新战争挑拨者和为保卫和平而斗争的政策。
    还在一九四八年党的第五次大会上季米特洛夫就已揭露了美英帝国主义是新战争的挑拨者，而且着重指出了苏联在保卫和平事业中所起的重大作用。他说：“苏联的国际威信和威力无比地增长起来了……社会主义和民主的力量是不可战胜的。在国际政治中，苏联成为了一个决定性的因素，他成了为和平和各国人民安全以及他们循着进步和真正民主道路自由发展的堡垒。领导全世界反帝国主义统一战线的苏联对国际反动派想实现黑暗勾当——把人民再投入新的世界战争中去——是一个不可克服的阻碍。”
    “苏联对帝国主义者想用原子武器来恐吓人民的企图给了决定性的打击。苏联依靠自己增长中的经济和政治力量，依靠自己不可战胜的军队，依靠关切保持和平的全世界工人和劳动者的全心的支持，贯彻着自己经过考验的和平的及各民族间友好合作的政策。侵略者与新战争挑拨者的计划将遭到不可避免的破产。”
    “在资本主义和专制主义统治集团统治下，人民曾经是愚昧和无能为力的时代已经过去了。全世界爱好和平的人民更坚决地动员自己的力量来保卫和平、民主和世界文化；以苏联为首的力量不断增长的世界反帝国主义战线更加清楚了。今天当美国帝国主义用原子炸弹威胁和平和无耻地夸耀用这些原子炸弹能消灭千百万人和破坏整个国家和地区的时候，所有人民都把苏联看作世界和平主要捍卫者，和使文明免受资本主义摧残的保卫者。”
    “不仅苏联和人民民主国家，而且资本主义国家和殖民地的绝大多数人民，都团结到和平战线中来。”
            对中国人民英雄斗争的赞扬
    “战后反帝国主义统一战线在远东扩大了，现在在这战线中有为自己民族独立而斗争的印尼、越南、缅甸及其他殖民地人民。”
    “中国人民为自己的独立而对帝国主义及其收买的在中国的反动代理人进行长期的坚强的英雄的斗争，这斗争对两个阵营力量对比有非常重大意义。”
    “中国事件是一个巨大的因素，使疯狂的美帝国主义计划混乱颠倒。……以兄弟国家苏联和各国共产党为先锋的全世界人民群众的反帝国主义力量，能够挫败侵略的帝国主义的好战阴谋，从而保证全世界的持久和平。”
    保加利亚人民共和国忠诚地遵守着它的创始人季米特洛夫的这些遗训。它坚决地站在以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营中，并且全力保卫世界和平。在世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言上，有五百六十二万七千人签了名，这一事实表明了我国劳动者对美英新战争贩子及其在巴尔干的工具——铁托法西斯集团、希腊保皇法西斯和土耳其反动派的仇恨。每一个保加利亚的爱国男女都在心里深深地记着自己导师季米特洛夫的遗训：以一切力量保障和防卫我们祖国的民族独立和国家主权，不受任何帝国主义的侵犯。我国人民的敌人通过我们边界派来间谍和破坏者的企图，都被我们光荣的边防军在边区人民的积极协助之下粉碎了。
    在季米特洛夫的领导下，在联共（布）党和伟大的斯大林的不断教导下，我们的党已长成为一个以马克思列宁主义革命理论武装起来的布尔什维克党。
            党领导人民取得巨大胜利
    季米特洛夫去世两年来，党在契尔文科夫同志的领导下，正根据他所规划的、建设社会主义的道路前进，并取得日新月异的胜利。
    季米特洛夫教导我们要像保护眼睛似的维护党的统一、党的纯洁性及其铁的纪律，并经常加强我们的革命警觉性。
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会在契尔文科夫同志的领导下，揭露了和毫不留情地粉碎了侵入党和政府机构并在那里造了魔窟的特莱考斯托夫斯基匪帮——帝国主义的代理人。党和政府以同样的严厉手段，继续揭发和肃清这批外国代理人的残余。
    党更加紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围，增强自己的革命警觉性，以更加不调和的态度对待缺点和错误以及有着缺点和错误的人。我国全体劳动者以更加坚定的精神团结在共产党的周围，以更大的忠诚支持它的建设社会主义的政策、和平政策以及与伟大苏联友好的政策。
    季米特洛夫不倦地教导党勇敢地开展批评和自我批评，以对我们工作中的缺点不调和的精神教育党。他无情地斥责各式“大人、先生们”的任性、严厉谴责在党内采用命令的方法。他在党第五次代表大会上的结论中说：“对于真正的共产党员来说，最大的智慧便在于及时老老实实和真诚地承认和觉悟到所犯的错误，勇敢地揭发产生这一错误的原因，和坚决地迅速与无情地消灭和纠正这一错误。”
    在契尔文科夫的领导下，我们党内更加积极地开展着作为我们发展动力的批评和自我批评。党特别注意下层组织的批评。契尔文科夫同志热烈地号召党员、工人阶级和所有的劳动人民勇敢地进行批评：“批评吧！勇敢地、公开地批评我们工作中的毛病和缺点！不要害怕批评！不要因为不能精确地表达自己的思想而踯躅不敢批评！”
            保国人民决心维护和平的事业
    由列宁与斯大林的忠实学生季米特洛夫及其继承者契尔文科夫所教养的我们的党，始终忠实于无产阶级的国际主义，并以国际团结及与各国人民友好的精神教育全体劳动人民。
    我国人民坚立在和平民主阵营内，并在它的前列中为维护和平而奋斗。我国人民向朝鲜人民的英勇斗争致敬，他们正同英勇的中国人民志愿军一起为自己祖国的自由与独立战斗着，以反对美帝国主义强盗的侵略。我国人民向伟大的中国人民致敬，他们正在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下开展广泛的和平建设并建设着新的生活。
    保加利亚劳动人民履行着季米特洛夫的遗训，和斯大林同志关于“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”的指示，正积极地参加各国人民争取和平的伟大斗争。争取和平运动在我国正日益巨大地扩展着。
    季米特洛夫为它工作了一生和贡献出了自己全部力量的伟大事业，现正掌握在他所培养与锻炼的、他的事业的忠实继承者契尔文科夫同志所领导的保共的手里。保加利亚人民在保共领导下和以契尔文科夫同志为首，正在依靠着苏联的兄弟援助，不屈不挠地完成自己亲爱的导师与领袖的遗训，建设着我们的社会主义。
    我们崇高的与亲爱的导师和领袖季米特洛夫仅是躯体逝世了。他的事业还活着，而且正在取得胜利。他活在他所建立与培养的保共的钢铁般的队伍中，活在他所创立的人民民主国家里，活在英勇的工人阶级中，活在劳动农民和人民知识分子中。他活在我国的优秀的人民青年中。他活在每个真诚爱国者的心灵中。这些爱国者们已在建设新的、最宝贵的和宏伟的季米特洛夫的纪念碑——他把他的美好的一生献给了它的社会主义社会。
    季米特洛夫是与我国劳动人民，我国宏伟的社会主义建设血肉相连的。
    让对我们亲爱的导师和领袖——不朽的季米特洛夫的光辉的记忆永生！
    季米特洛夫永垂不朽！
    发展和巩固以出色的领导者和季米特洛夫事业的继承者契尔文科夫同志为首的光荣的保加利亚共产党！
    发展和巩固以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营！
    发展和巩固保苏友好——我国民族独立的保证！
    我们的导师和领袖，全体进步人类的导师斯大林万岁！
                                 （文内插题是本报编者加的）
