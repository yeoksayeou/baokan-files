　　Shanghai Holds Celebration Rally for Completion of Huai River Sluice Gate Installation
　  Comrade Zeng Shan Points Out: This Fact Proves That Under the Leadership of the Working Class and on the Basis of the Worker-Peasant Alliance, Any New Construction in New China Can Succeed.
    After the Shanghai metalworkers victoriously completed the task of manufacturing machinery parts and on-site installation for the flood storage sluice gate in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Metalworkers' Union, and the East China Industrial Department jointly held a celebration rally in Shanghai on July 22nd. Zeng Shan, Director of the Huai River Harnessing Committee, attended and spoke at this celebration rally. He emphasized that in carrying out this project, Shanghai workers and farmers at the Huai River construction site closely united and cooperated, ensuring the project's successful completion. This fact proves that under the leadership of the working class and on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, any new construction in New China can succeed. At the end of the meeting, Zeng Shan presented awards to various units.
    Over 12,000 workers and technicians from 123 factories in Shanghai began rushing to manufacture the Huai River sluice gate parts in early April. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, this arduous task was completed on May 26th. During the work, employees put forward 180 rationalization proposals, saving 25,700 man-days compared to the original plan. Many employees voluntarily extended their daily working hours to conduct shock work. Workers at the No. 3 Factory of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company rushed to repair steelmaking furnaces under high heat of 400 degrees Celsius, ensuring the supply of steel. At the end of May, employees organized a technical engineering team of more than 700 people to rush to the Huai River construction site, cooperating with farmers, braving the scorching sun and heavy rain, and carrying out installation work intensely. As a result, the installation project of the more than three-mile-long Runheji sluice gate in the middle reaches of the Huai River was completed ahead of schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　上海举行淮河水闸装置完毕庆功大会
　  曾山同志指出：这一事实证明，在工人阶级领导下和工农联盟的基础上，新中国任何新建设都能成功。
    上海市五金工人胜利完成淮河中游蓄洪水闸的机件制造任务及在工地的装置工程后，上海总工会、五金工会及华东工业部特于七月二十二日在上海联合举行庆功大会。在这次庆功大会上，治淮委员会主任曾山出席讲话。他着重指出：在进行这次工程中，上海的工人与淮河工地的农民亲密团结合作，使这一工程胜利成功。这一事实证明：在工人阶级领导下和工农联盟的基础上，新中国任何新的建设都能成功。大会最后由曾山向各单位授奖。
    上海市一百二十三个工厂的一万二千余工人和技术人员，四月初开始赶制淮河水闸机件。由于全体职工的努力，这个艰巨任务在五月二十六日即告完成。在工作中职工们提出了一百八十件合理化建议，使人工较原计划节省了二万五千七百个。很多职工自动地延长每天工作时间，进行突击。上海钢铁公司第三厂工人在摄氏四百度的高热下抢修炼钢炉，保证了钢料的供应。五月底，职工们又组织了七百余人的技术工程队赶赴淮河工地，配合农民，冒着烈日和大雨，紧张地进行安装工作。因此提前完成了淮河中游润河集三里多长的水闸装置工程。（新华社）
