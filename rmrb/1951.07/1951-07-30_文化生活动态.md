　　Cultural Life Trends
　　Shanghai Opera Circles Praise the Chinese Communist Party
　　"The Kindness of the Communist Party is Endless," in the fifth issue of the first volume of "Popular Opera," is a special issue commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party. Thirty-two famous artists from Peking Opera, Yue Opera, Shanghai Opera, Jianghuai Opera, and Pingtan, including Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Yuan Xuefen, Wang Shaolou, Fu Quanxiang, Fan Ruijuan, and Ding Shi'e, all described their understanding and gratitude towards the Communist Party. Mei Lanfang expressed gratitude for the Communist Party's heroic struggle, which liberated hundreds of thousands of opera workers throughout China and restored the human dignity that had been deprived for thousands of years. Zhou Xinfang believed that in the old society, the reactionary government looked down on their acting, but after liberation, the People's Government respected and cared for artists. Yuan Xuefen attended the National People's Political Consultative Conference the year before last and went abroad to participate in the Second World Peace Congress last year. She said, "I never dreamed of having such opportunities for learning and honor." Jianghuai Opera artist Ma Lintong was originally illiterate, but now he can copy the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." Yue Opera artist Zhang Yanfei, after liberation, received education from the Communist Party, joined the Youth League, and gained a deeper understanding of politics and improved her cultural level. She thanked the Communist Party! From the artists' descriptions, it is fully demonstrated that under the leadership of the Communist Party, their political consciousness has been significantly improved, and they understand how to use their artistic talents to educate the broad masses of people.
　　New Book Commemorating Mr. Lu Xun, "Comforting Remembrance," Published
　　The new book "Comforting Remembrance," recently published by the People's Literature Publishing House, is a collection of essays commemorating Mr. Lu Xun. The book collects a portion of the articles written by Mr. Xu Guangping commemorating Mr. Lu Xun from his death in 1936 to 1949. In the fifteen articles in the book, Mr. Xu Guangping intimately and meticulously wrote about Mr. Lu Xun's writing life, study life, entertainment life, and family life, which is helpful for annotating Mr. Lu Xun's works and compiling Mr. Lu Xun's biography and chronology, and is also a valuable material for studying Mr. Lu Xun. The book is edited by Wang Shijing, with concentrated selection of materials, exquisite typesetting and printing, and seven illustrations about Mr. Lu Xun's life. Because the author lived under the rule of the reactionaries before, there are some euphemisms in the articles, which are now annotated by the editor. Such conscientious and responsible editorial work is worth learning from by the publishing industry.
　　Literary and Art Periodicals in Various Provinces Have Improved in Popularization Work
　　Since literary and art periodicals at the provincial level throughout the country clarified the policy of popularization, many literary and art periodicals have improved. "Liberation Literature and Art," run by the Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has made efforts to popularize it very early, so it can now, to some extent, make the masses understand and read it, and pay attention to publishing the masses' own writings. It has been greatly welcomed by the masses. "Shandong Literature and Art" run by the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles, "Huaihai Literature and Art" run by the Xuzhou Federation of Literary and Art Circles, "Literature and Art" run by the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and literary and art periodicals in some other places, because they have not clearly and implemented the popularization policy, and mistakenly developed towards "large-scale" literary and art periodicals, they cannot adapt to the needs of the whole country and meet the local needs. Moreover, some periodicals, especially "Huaihai Literature and Art," publish translated articles in more than half of their pages. These periodicals have small sales and are not welcomed by the masses, which is inevitable. "Shandong Literature and Art" has now been discontinued. "Jiangxi Literature and Art" has begun to pay attention to publishing the masses' own creations in the fourth issue of the second volume, correcting the past erroneous style of being divorced from the masses. "Hubei Literature and Art" used to be one of the more popular literary and art periodicals in the provincial-level literary and art periodicals, mainly targeting farmers. It aims to make the literate understand and the illiterate understand by listening, and publishes many folk songs and ditties that are widely spread among the masses and reflect the glorious struggle history of the local people, which are very popular among the masses. The fifth issue of the third volume of the magazine is a special issue for rural drama troupes, publishing some of the rural drama troupes' own creations and introductions to work experience. In the editorial of the magazine "Expanding and Consolidating the Rural Drama Troupe Movement," it is proposed that about 1,000 rural drama troupes have been organized in the province, which can regularly connect with more than 800,000 people. As a popular magazine, "Hubei Literature and Art" is very necessary to pay attention to providing rural drama troupes with new scripts and singing materials, exchanging experiences, and guiding the activities of the troupes.
　　Literary and Art Circles Launch Criticism of Petty-Bourgeois Ideology
　　The literary and artistic creation of criticizing petty-bourgeois ideology with proletarian ideology has further attracted the attention of literary and artistic circles. After criticizing Bi Ye's novel "Our Strength is Invincible," Wenhua Film Company's film "Battalion Commander Guan," Xiao Yemu's novels "Between Our Couple," "On the Haihe River," "Love," and "Tempering" and other works, recently, the second issue of the first volume of "Liberation Army Literature and Art" published another commendable paper: "On the Harm of Petty-Bourgeois Ideology to Literary and Artistic Creation." The author, Zhang Liyun, took the novel "Our Strength is Invincible" as an example, pointing out that the novel's mistake lies in not writing about the leading role of the Party and the power of political work in the People's Liberation Army, not writing about the strict political and military discipline of the People's Liberation Army, not writing about the high military quality of the People's Liberation Army, not writing about the political principles of the internal relations and internal life of the People's Liberation Army, and not writing about the excellent qualities and optimism of the People's Liberation Army. All these mistakes are the result of looking at problems from the standpoint and viewpoint of the petty bourgeoisie. The author further analyzed the differences between looking at the People's Liberation Army from the standpoint, ideology, and viewpoint of the proletariat and the standpoint, ideology, and viewpoint of the petty bourgeoisie. Using the standpoint, ideology, and viewpoint of the petty bourgeoisie to write about the People's Liberation Army can only distort the People's Liberation Army into an unorganized and undisciplined army without Party leadership and political work, and can only describe the People's Liberation Army as fighting solely on "courage" and "individual bravery," and can only vulgarly describe the internal relations and life of the People's Liberation Army, and can only describe the image of the People's Liberation Army as crude and vulgar, and with a pessimistic and depressed atmosphere. If we want to correctly create the heroic image of the People's Liberation Army, we must use proletarian ideology and feelings. Therefore, clarifying the boundary between proletarian ideology and feelings and petty-bourgeois ideology and feelings is a major issue of creative ideology that must be resolved in the literary and art circles at present.
　　Fedorinko Publishes a Special Article in the Soviet Literary Gazette Discussing the Growth of New Chinese Literature
　　The Soviet Literary Gazette published an article by Fedorinko on July 17 entitled "The Youthful Strength of Chinese Literature." The article pointed out that the victory of the Chinese people has opened up a broad path for the development of Chinese literature, and many writers and poets are engaged in creating works about the leading role of the working class with great creative enthusiasm. The characters they praise are mostly labor heroes, advanced producers, and outstanding people of New China.
　　Some advanced Chinese writers, such as Ding Ling, Zhao Shuli, and Zhou Libo, have written about the great changes in the lives of the Chinese people, patriotic laborers, and their heroic deeds in their works. In addition, some young writers' works have also been well received. Many of these young writers are from working-class backgrounds and only started writing after the great victory of the Chinese people, such as Zhang Deyu and others.
　　One of the characteristics of modern Chinese literature is the increasingly close connection between writers and poets, playwrights, and factories. Many writers carry out cultural and educational work in factories and engage in creation with the assistance of workers.
　　The influence of Gorky is unusually clear in the works of Chinese writers. Gorky's tradition and the experience of Soviet literature help Chinese writers reflect the new phenomena in the development of the Chinese revolution and create the great and spiritually beautiful image of the true heroes of our time.
　　In the themes of modern Chinese literature, free and happy labor occupies a large position.
　　In the literary and art magazines published in China's capital and provinces and cities, there are more and more works by workers. Such as "Red Flowers Need Green Leaves" written by Zhang Deyu, a worker of the China Changchun Railway, and the script "Not a Cicada" written by Wei Lianzhen, a railway worker in Shijiazhuang.
　　In addition to short stories and scripts, worker writers have also written many poems. Special attention should be paid to the beautiful lyric poem "Our Factory" written by Wang Dongwei. In this poem, the author expresses his infinite love for the motherland and sings the happiness of free labor.
　　The works of worker writers express the creativity of the revolution, the joy of free labor, and embody the policies of the People's Government. These creations prove that young writers have valuable qualities: familiarity with life and a sense of new things.

  上海戏曲界赞颂中国共产党
    《大众戏曲》一卷五期的《共产党的恩情说不完》，是纪念中国共产党诞生三十周年的特辑，京剧、越剧、沪剧、江淮剧、评弹等三十二位著名艺人梅兰芳、周信芳、袁雪芬、王少楼、傅全香、范瑞娟、丁是娥等，都叙述了对共产党的认识和感激。梅兰芳感谢着共产党的英勇斗争，使全中国几十万戏曲工作者得到了解放，恢复了千百年来被剥夺的人的尊严。周信芳认为在旧社会里，反动政府看不起他们演戏的；解放以后，人民政府却是尊重艺人爱护艺人的。袁雪芬前年出席了全国人民政治协商会议，去年又出国参加第二届世界和平大会，她说：“这种学习的机会和荣誉，我是做梦也没有想到过。”江淮剧艺人马麟童本来不识字，但现在已能抄写“惩治反革命条例”了。越剧艺人章燕飞在解放后，受了共产党的教育，参加了青年团，对政治有了进一步的认识，文化也有了提高，她感谢共产党！从艺人们的叙述里，充分说明了他们在共产党的领导下，政治觉悟有了显著的提高，他们懂得了怎样运用自己所擅长的艺术，去教育广大人民群众。
  纪念鲁迅先生的新书《欣慰的纪念》出版
    人民文学出版社最近出版的新书《欣慰的纪念》是纪念鲁迅先生的一本文集，该书所搜集的，是从一九三六年鲁迅先生逝世后到一九四九年为止，许广平先生所写的纪念鲁迅先生的文章的一部分。在该书十五篇文章中，许广平先生亲切细致地写出了鲁迅先生的写作生活、学习生活、娱乐生活和家庭生活等等，对注释鲁迅先生作品和编写鲁迅先生传记和年谱都有好处，对于研究鲁迅先生，也是可宝贵的材料。该书由王士菁编辑，选材集中，排印精美，并有关于鲁迅先生生活的插图七幅。作者因以前在反动派统治之下生活，文章中有一些隐讳之处，现在都由编辑人加以注释。像这样认真负责的编辑工作，是值得出版界学习的。
  各省文艺刊物在通俗化工作上有改进
    全国省一级的文艺刊物自明确了通俗化的方针后，不少文艺刊物已有改进。河南文联办的《翻身文艺》，因为很早就作通俗化的努力，所以现在能够在某种程度上做到群众能听懂、读懂，并注意刊登群众自己的写作。受到了群众的很大欢迎。山东省文联办的《山东文艺》、徐州市文联办的《淮海文艺》、南京市文联办的《文艺》及有些地方的文艺刊物，因为没有明确与贯彻通俗化方针，错误地向“大型”文艺刊物发展，不但不能适应全国需要和切合当地需要，而且有些刊物，特别是《淮海文艺》竟以一半以上的篇幅刊登翻译文章。这些刊物，销数微小，不受群众欢迎，乃是必然的。《山东文艺》现已停刊。《江西文艺》已于二卷四期，开始注意刊登群众自己的创作，纠正过去脱离群众的错误作风。《湖北文艺》过去在省一级文艺刊物中，是以农民为主要对象的，比较通俗的文艺刊物之一。它以做到识字的能看懂，不识字的能听懂为努力目标，发表了不少在群众中流传很广，反映当地人民光荣斗争历史的民歌小调，很受群众欢迎。该刊三卷五期是一个农村剧团专号，发表了一些农村剧团自己的创作和工作经验介绍。在该刊“扩大和巩固农村剧团运动”的社论里，提出全省已组织一千左右的农村剧团，能够经常联系八十万以上的群众。作为普及刊物的《湖北文艺》，能够注意去做供给农村剧团以新的剧本和演唱材料、交流经验，及指导剧团的活动等，是很必要的。
  文艺界展开对小资产阶级思想的批判
    用无产阶级思想批判小资产阶级思想的文艺创作，已经进一步引起了文艺界的注意。在批评了碧野的小说《我们的力量是无敌的》、文华影片公司影片《关连长》、萧也牧的小说《我们夫妇之间》、《海河边上》、《爱情》、《锻炼》等作品后，最近，《解放军文艺》一卷二期又登载了一篇值得推荐的论文：《论小资产阶级思想对文艺创作的危害性》。作者张立云以《我们的力量是无敌的》小说为例，指出小说的错误是在于没有写出人民解放军中党的领导作用和政治工作的威力，没有写出人民解放军的严格的政治纪律和军事纪律，没有写出人民解放军的高度军事素养，没有写出人民解放军的内部关系和内部生活的政治原则性，没有写出人民解放军的优秀品质和乐观主义。所有这些错误都是由于用小资产阶级立场观点看问题的结果。作者更进一步地分析了用无产阶级立场、思想观点和小资产阶级立场、思想观点来看待人民解放军究竟有何不同。用小资产阶级立场、思想观点来写人民解放军，就只能把人民解放军歪曲成为无组织无纪律、无党的领导和无政治工作的，就只能把人民解放军描写成为是光凭“胆子”和“匹夫之勇”作战，就只能庸俗地描写了人民解放军的内部关系和生活，也就只能把人民解放军的形象描写成为粗鲁卑俗的，而且有着悲观沮丧的气氛。如要正确地创造人民解放军的英雄形象，必须用无产阶级的思想感情。因此，划清无产阶级思想感情和小资产阶级思想感情的界限，是目前文艺界必须解决的一个创作思想的重大问题。
  费多林科在苏联文学报发表专文论述中国新文学的成长
    苏联文学报七月十七日刊载了费多林科的以《中国文学的青春力量》为题的论文。该文指出中国人民的胜利给中国文学打开了广阔的发展道路，许多作家和诗人以巨大的创作热情从事创作关于工人阶级的领导作用的作品。他们所歌颂的人物多是劳动英雄，生产先进者和新中国的优秀的人们。
    中国一些先进的作家们，如丁玲、赵树理、周立波等在他们的作品中写出了中国人民生活中的伟大变革，爱国的劳动者和他们的英勇事迹。此外，还有一些青年作家的作品，也得到了好评，这些青年作家中许多是工人出身，而且是在中国人民伟大的胜利之后才从事写作的，如张德裕等人。
    现代中国文学中的特点之一，就是作家和诗人以及剧作家与工厂日益密切地联系起来。许多作家在工厂中进行文化教育工作，在工人们协助下从事创作。
    中国作家的作品中，异常清晰地表现出高尔基的影响。高尔基的传统，苏联文学的经验，帮助中国作家们反映出中国革命发展中的新现象，创造出我们时代真正英雄的伟大及精神美丽的形象。
    在现代中国文学的主题中，自由的快乐的劳动，占有很大地位。
    在中国的首都和各省市出版的文艺杂志中，愈来愈多地出现有工人们的作品。如中长铁路工人张德裕所写《红花还得绿叶扶》以及石家庄铁路工人魏连珍所写剧本《不是蝉》等。
    除去短篇小说和剧本，工人作家们还写了不少诗歌。值得特殊注意的是王东维所写的优美的抒情诗《我们的工厂》。在这篇诗中，作者表现出对祖国无限的爱并歌颂着自由劳动的幸福。
    工人作家的作品，表现了革命的创造性，表现了自由劳动的快乐，体现了人民政府的政策。这些创作证明了青年作家们具有宝贵的品质：熟习生活和对新鲜事物的感觉。
