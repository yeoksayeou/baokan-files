　　Employees of Beijing Xiesheng Raw Cloth Store
　　Establish Patriotic Pact and Regular Inspection System
　　Improvements in Union Work and Store Business
　　After the employees of Beijing Seventh District Xiesheng Raw Cloth Store established a patriotic pact, they created a regular inspection system to ensure that employees earnestly implement the patriotic pact and to enhance everyone's political awareness and work enthusiasm; this has led to improvements in both union work and store business.

　　The patriotic pact of the Xiesheng Raw Cloth Store employees was passed under the leadership of the union, after repeated discussions in group meetings and general meetings. This patriotic pact has five articles: (1) Assist and supervise the capitalist in completing tax payment tasks on schedule. (2) Assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. (3) Ensure the implementation of resolutions from labor-capital consultation meetings and provide attentive service to customers. (4) Care about union work. Do not be absent from meetings without reason, and offer more opinions during group discussions. (5) Conscientiously study current events. In addition, three of the store's five union groups have also formulated group pacts based on their respective business operations.

　　In order to ensure the implementation of the patriotic pact, all employees appointed three union committee members to form an inspection team, responsible for inspecting the implementation of the patriotic pact. Each union group also drew a "Work Inspection Table" to regularly record the implementation of the patriotic pact; group meetings were also held once a week to conduct criticism and praise. At the end of each month, the union committee would make a summary at the general membership meeting based on the inspection records, commending the good and criticizing the bad.

　　After the patriotic pact was established, the labor discipline of the store's employees and their attitude towards customers greatly improved. For example, in the past, sales staff would become impatient when customers repeatedly picked and chose items, and would make cutting remarks to customers who spent a long time browsing without buying anything. Now they have corrected this bad habit. The phenomenon of employees casually leaving their posts to chat with others has also disappeared. The store's turnover in May increased by 12 percent compared to March and April; this is greatly related to the improvement in the workers' business skills.

　　In addition, employees are now more concerned about the union. Now everyone attends union meetings and speaks actively. Member Shi Jinxi lost his membership card a few months ago and didn't care about it at the time; now he is urging the union to reissue it to him. The union is also more earnestly serving its members. When member Li Jinyu's mother died, he didn't have money for the burial. The union called on employees to promote class solidarity, collecting some money for him and borrowing some from the capitalist on his behalf, solving his difficulties. In this way, everyone feels that the union is like their own home.

### 北京协成生布店职工  建立爱国公约经常检查制度  工会工作商店业务都有改进

　　北京协成生布店职工
    建立爱国公约经常检查制度
    工会工作商店业务都有改进
    北京市第七区协成生布店职工订立爱国公约后，建立了经常的检查制度，保证职工认真执行爱国公约，并提高了大家的政治觉悟和工作积极性；使工会工作和商店业务都有了改进。
    协成生布店职工的爱国公约是在工会领导下，经过小组会和全体大会反复讨论而通过的。这个爱国公约共五条：（一）协助与督促资方按期完成纳税任务。（二）协助政府镇压反革命。（三）保证执行劳资协商会议的决议，对顾客招待周到。（四）关心工会工作。开会不无故缺席，小组讨论时多提意见。（五）认真学习时事。此外，该店五个工会小组中有三个小组又根据本组业务订出了小组公约。
    为了保证爱国公约的执行，全体职工任命三个工会委员组成检查小组，负责检查爱国公约执行情况。每个工会小组又画一张“工作检查表”，经常记录爱国公约执行情况；每周并举行一次小组会，进行批评表扬。每到月底，工会委员会就在全体会员大会上根据检查记录作一次总结，表扬好的，批评坏的。
    爱国公约订立后，该店职工的劳动纪律和对顾客的态度都大有改进。如售货组职工过去遇有顾客反复挑捡就感到不耐烦，对挑了半天不买东西的顾客就刻薄几句。现在他们已经纠正了这种不好的作风。职工们工作时随便离自己的岗位去找人聊天的现象也没有了。该号五月份的流水账已比三、四月份增加了百分之十二；这和工人在业务上的改进有很大关系。
    此外，职工们对工会也更关心了。现在工会开会时人人出席，发言普遍。会员石金玺前几个月把会员证丢了，当初不关心这件事；现在就催着工会给他补。工会也更切实地为会员服务。会员李金玉的母亲死了，没钱埋葬。工会就号召职工发扬阶级友爱，凑了一部分钱给他，又代他向资方借了一部分，解决了他的困难。这样，大家都感到工会好像是自己的家一样。
