　　How Workers at the Beijing General Machinery Plant are Promoting High-Speed Cutting Methods

　　Old-style belt-driven lathes can have their efficiency more than doubled simply by modifying the shape of the cutting tool. The technical personnel and workers at the Beijing General Machinery Plant have fully demonstrated this in the process of promoting high-speed cutting methods.

　　The factory's workers used to believe that high-speed cutting methods could only be used on Soviet lathes or automatic lathes. In May, Soviet experts came to the factory to demonstrate high-speed cutting methods and encouraged everyone to adopt high-speed cutting or accelerated cutting. The technical staff and workers were deeply impressed by the amazing results of this new working method. Workers like Zhang Shilin in the Machine Shop used their own belt-driven lathes for experiments. They replaced the original high-speed steel cutters with hard alloy cutters, changed the angle of the tool, accelerated the spindle speed, and deepened the cutting depth. The first experiment yielded great results. The efficiency of Zhang Shilin's lathe doubled as a result, dispelling the concern that old-style belt-driven lathes could not accelerate cutting. Tool班 workers Ma Zhigang and others experimented on automatic lathes, increasing production efficiency by seven and a half times. The entire factory's lathe operators were excited and eager to use this advanced method for production. The leadership established a "High-Speed Cutting Research and Promotion Committee," composed of technical personnel and workers, to specifically promote this work. With the help of technical personnel, more and more workers are accelerating cutting. Machine Shop worker Zhao Delu used to spend nine hours turning a support wheel shaft on a belt-driven lathe. Now, he only replaced the high-speed steel cutter with a hard alloy cutter and increased the spindle speed, and it only takes one hour, one minute, and eighteen seconds to turn a support wheel shaft, increasing efficiency by 8.85 times. Tool班 worker Liu Yuming used to spend twenty minutes turning a screw on an automatic lathe. Now, without even changing the tool, just by grinding the tool angle appropriately and increasing the spindle speed from 100 revolutions to 390 revolutions, it takes three minutes to turn one, increasing efficiency more than six times.

　　Currently, the factory's small and medium-sized lathes, although not implementing high-speed cutting methods, are universally accelerating cutting. Without modifying the machines, automatic lathes have already increased efficiency by three to seven and a half times, and belt-driven lathes have also increased efficiency by one and a half to two and a half times. This is still limited by insufficient motor power and excessive vibration of the lineshaft. Otherwise, the efficiency would be even higher. The factory is now planning to modify the machines and increase power.

　　The factory's machinery and equipment are not better than those of other factories. Three-quarters of their lathes are old-fashioned belt-driven lathes, and many of the spindle brass bushings are worn out. The belts are not wide or thick enough, and the lineshaft is also thin. However: in this situation, they absorbed the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, replaced the cutters with hard alloy steel cutters, changed the tool shape, and some even without changing the tool, just by changing the tool shape (doing so requires adding machine oil as a coolant to the shaft tiles and centers when speeding up the spindle rotation), and increased efficiency so much. Any machine factory can do this. Without spending much money, the efficiency of machines can be increased several times using existing machinery and equipment. If all the machine factories in the country do this, it would be equivalent to the country increasing its machines several times over.

### 北京机器总厂工人是怎样推行高速切削法的

　　北京机器总厂工人是怎样推行高速切削法的
    旧式皮带车床，只要改一改刀形，就可以提高效率一倍以上。北京机器总厂技术人员和工人在推行高速切削法的过程里，充分证明了这一点。
    该厂工人从前都认为只有在苏联车床或自动车床上，才能用高速切削法。五月里，苏联专家到该厂表演高速切削法，而且鼓励大伙儿采用高速切削法，或是加速切削。技术人员和工人们看到这个新式工作方法的惊人成绩，都佩服极了。机工部工人张士林等，就用自己的皮带车床作试验。他们把原来的高速钢刀换成硬质合金刀，改变刀具的角度，加速主轴的转动次数，加深吃刀的深度，第一次试验就有了很大的成绩。张士林车床的效率因此提高了两倍。打破了旧式皮带车床不能加速切削的顾虑。工具班工人马至刚等在自动车床上试验，提高生产效率七倍半。全厂的车工都轰动了，急着要用这个先进方法来生产。领导上成立了“高速切削研究推行委员会”，由技术人员和工人共同组成，专门推进这个工作。在技术人员的帮助下，工人们加速切削的更多了。机工部工人赵德禄，以前在皮带车床上旋支轮轴，旋一个得九个钟头。现在他只是把高速钢刀换成硬质合金刀，增加主轴转动速度，旋一个支轮轴，只要一个钟头零一分十八秒就行了。提高效率八点八五倍。工具班工人刘玉明，以前在自动车床上镟螺丝，二十分钟才旋一个。现在连刀具都没有换，只是把刀的角度磨得合适了，主轴的转动就从一百转提高到三百九十转，三分钟镟一个，提高效率六倍多。
    现在该厂中小型车床子，虽然没有实行高速切削法，但是都普遍地加速切削。机器并没有改装，自动车床已经提高效率三倍到七倍半，皮带车床也提高效率一倍半到两倍半。这还是受马达不够劲儿和天轴震动太厉害等等限制。不然的话，效率还要高。现在该厂正计划改装机器增加动力。
    该厂的机器设备并不比别的工厂好。他们的车床，四分之三是老式的皮带车床，好些主轴铜瓦都磨坏了。皮带不够宽厚，天轴也细。但是：就在这种情况下，他们吸取了苏联的先进经验，换用了硬质合金钢刀，改了刀形，有的甚至连刀具都没有改，只是改了刀形（这样做，在加快主轴转动时，需要在轴瓦和顶尖上加机器油当冷却剂），就提高效率这么多。任何机器工厂都可以这样做。不必多花钱，利用原有的机器设备就可以提高机器效率好几倍。如果全国机器工厂都这样做，就等于全国增加了几倍机器。
