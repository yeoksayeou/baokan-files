　　Domestic Market Shrinking Due to Military Expansion and Tax Increases
　  U.S. Auto Worker Unemployment Soars
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th Dispatch from Telecommunications Agency] The Michigan *Worker* reported that by the end of July, approximately 200,000 auto workers nationwide in the United States will be unemployed. In Michigan alone, where the largest auto factories are located, 140,000 will be unemployed. The Michigan Unemployment Relief Committee predicts that 75,000 people will be unemployed in Detroit alone, in addition to the 68,000 who have been laid off since January of this year. The reasons for this massive unemployment in the American auto industry are: factories are switching to producing munitions; purchasing power is decreasing due to rising prices and taxes, thus the domestic auto market is shrinking; and at the same time, there is an unbelievable speed-up system in the factories.

　　国内市场因扩军增税而日益缩小
　  美汽车工人失业人数激增
    【新华社二十七日讯】据电通社纽约二十五日讯：密执安《工人报》报道，到七月底，美国全国将有二十万左右汽车工人失业，单在最大汽车工厂所在地的密执安州，即将有十四万人失业。“密执安失业救济委员会”预言，单在底特律市，即将有七万五千人失业，此外还必须加上自本年一月以来被解雇的六万八千人。美国汽车工业中的这种大量失业的现象的原因是：工厂转而生产军火；购买力日益因物价和捐税上升而减低，因而国内汽车市场日益缩小；同时工厂中又存在着难以相信的赶快制度。
