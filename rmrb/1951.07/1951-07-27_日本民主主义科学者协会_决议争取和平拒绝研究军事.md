　  决议争取和平拒绝研究军事
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：拥有八千余会员、在全国有八十多个支部的日本民主主义科学者协会，在“保卫学术与研究的自由、使学术界民主化”的方针下，不断与美日反动派进行斗争。
    据六月六日日本《全农林新闻》消息，日本民主主义科学者协会曾于五月二十七日在东京早稻田大学大隈礼堂召开第六届全国大会。会员报告活动情况后，决议成立“反对军事研究委员会”，规定“协会的组织是以和平运动为中心”。为了进一步加强活动，该会着重提出今后任务为：“向群众宣传和平思想，和群众共同参加和平运动。”大会最后并选出末川博（立命馆大学校长）为会长，伏见康治（大阪大学教授）、山之内一郎（东京大学教授）为副会长。
