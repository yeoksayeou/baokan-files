Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: The American judicial authorities continue to barbarously infringe upon the constitutional rights of the arrested leaders of the American Communist Party.

	New York Federal Court Judge Ryan unreasonably declared the American "Civil Rights Congress" bail invalid on the 11th and ordered the American Communist Party leaders arrested on June 20th to be imprisoned. On the 13th, Federal Appeals Court Judge Hand admitted that Ryan's decision was illegal, and the American Communist leaders were briefly bailed out on the same day. During their temporary release, the FBI, a US secret police agency, dispatched forty agents to monitor their movements, preventing them from contacting friends to obtain bail. On the 16th, Ryan canceled the "Civil Rights Congress" bail for the second time and ordered the defendants to pay the huge sum of bail by noon the next day. Under this ruling, which amounted to a blatant denial of the defendants' right to bail, all but Flynn were thrown back into prison on the 17th on the grounds that they had failed to pay the bail on time.

	At the same time, in order to quickly complete the persecution of American Communist Party cadres, the Federal Court opened a trial on the 20th against seventeen American Communist cadres. The defendants emphasized that it was impossible to prepare for trial in such a short period of time, especially since most of the defendants were in prison. However, Federal Judge McGohey ignored these protests.

	At the same time, the Court of Appeals also revoked the bail of Field, Hammett, and Hunton, the administrators of the "Civil Rights Congress" bail fund, on the ridiculous grounds that the bail was "unqualified," and they were re-imprisoned on the 17th. Field and others had been sentenced to imprisonment for "contempt of court" for refusing to hand over the list of donors to the bail fund and had been released on bail.

	The American judicial authorities' open trampling on civil liberties has even led the American magazine "New Republic" to criticize in a recent issue: "The government probably intends to deprive all these people of bail. If that is the case, then this is another ugly indication that the freedom we loudly defend is now being invaded by poisonous bacteria."

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Progressive people around the world continue to protest the US government's persecution of the leaders of the American Communist Party.

	The International Democratic Women's Federation telegraphed Truman to protest the wave of arrests of American peace defenders. The telegram said: "The International Democratic Women's Federation, representing ninety-one million women in sixty-one countries, protests the persecution of peace defenders. Women believe that the new wave of persecution is an attempt by your government to suppress calls for peace and a continuation of threats to world peace." The telegram demanded the immediate release of those arrested.

	Hungarian mass organizations also telegraphed the US government to protest the illegal detention and sentencing of the leaders of the American Communist Party. The telegram from the Hungarian National Peace Council stated, "American war speculators have made this shameful decision because they are afraid of peace and afraid of the American people's desire for peace."

	Brazilian Communist Party General Secretary Prestes sent a letter to American Communist Party Chairman Foster, expressing fraternal solidarity. Prestes's letter pointed out: "This evil action by American monopoly capitalists, aimed at suppressing the movement for peace and against fascism in the United States, also exposes the true nature of the Truman government to the Brazilian people and the people of all other countries around the world—it is the most vicious enemy of peace and humanity."

	French veterans who participated in the International Brigades against Franco, including French National Assembly member and Communist Party Secretary Marty, also sent a letter to Gates, editor of the New York "Daily Worker," expressing their solidarity with the American peace fighters now in prison.

　　美司法当局继续横蛮迫害美共领袖
　  国际民主妇联等致电杜鲁门提出抗议
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国司法当局继续蛮横地侵害被捕美国共产党领袖的宪法权利。
    纽约联邦法院法官赖恩于十一日无理地宣布美国“民权保障大会”保释金无效，并下令将六月二十日逮捕的美国共产党领袖下狱。十三日，联邦上诉法院法官汉德承认赖恩的决定非法，美共领袖曾于同日一度保出。在暂时释出期间，美国秘密警察机关联邦调查局特地派了四十名特务监视他们的行踪，以防他们与友人联系取得保释金。十六日，赖恩第二次取消了“民权保障大会”的保释金，并勒令被告必须于第二天午前缴足巨额保释金。在这种等于公然剥夺被告保释权的判决之下，除佛林一人外，其余美共领袖已于十七日被以逾期未缴保释金为理由再次投入监狱。
    与此同时，为了赶快完成对美国共产党干部的迫害，在联邦法院已于二十日对十七位美共干部开庭审讯。被告曾强调在这样短促时间内准备受审是不可能的，何况大多数被告是在狱中。但联邦法官麦克高海将这些抗议置之不理。
    同时，上诉法院还以保释金“不合格”的无稽理由，取消了“民权保障大会”保释金基金管理人费尔德、哈麦特及韩顿三人的保释，并于十七日将他们重新下狱。费尔德等是因为拒绝缴出保释金基金捐助人的名单被加上“蔑视法庭”的罪名而判处徒刑的，曾经保释出狱。
    美国司法当局如此公然践踏公民自由，以至连美国“新共和”杂志在新近一期中也抨击说：“政府的意思大概是要剥夺所有这些人的保释权。如果事情真是这样，那末，这就再一次丑恶地表明，现在有毒菌侵袭我们所高声维护的自由。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】世界进步人民继续抗议美国政府迫害美共领袖。
    国际民主妇女联合会致电杜鲁门，抗议对美国和平保卫者的逮捕浪潮。电文说：“代表着六十一个国家中九千一百万妇女的国际民主妇联抗议迫害和平保卫者。妇女们认为，新的迫害浪潮是你的政府企图压制和平呼声与继续威胁世界和平的表示。”电文要求立即释放被捕者。
    匈牙利各群众团体也致电美国政府抗议非法拘捕和判决美共领袖。匈牙利全国保卫和平委员会的电报称，“由于害怕和平、害怕美国人民对和平的意愿，美国战争投机家才作出这种可耻的决定。”
    巴西共产党总书记普列斯特致函美共主席福斯特，表示兄弟般的声援。普列斯特的信指出：“美国垄断资本家旨在镇压美国国内争取和平、反对法西斯主义的运动的这种邪恶行动，也在巴西人民以及全世界其他各国人民面前暴露了杜鲁门政府的真正性质——它是和平与人类的最狠毒的敌人。”
    法国曾参加反佛朗哥国际纵队的战士，包括法国国民议会议员、共产党书记马尔梯等，也致函纽约《工人日报》编辑盖兹，表示他们对现在狱中的美国和平战士的声援。
