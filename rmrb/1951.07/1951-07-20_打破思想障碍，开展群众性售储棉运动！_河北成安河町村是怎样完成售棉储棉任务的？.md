　　Break Through Ideological Obstacles and Launch a Mass Cotton Selling and Storage Movement!
　  – How Hechuan Village in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province Completed the Cotton Selling and Storage Tasks
　　Mi Rongyun
    Hechuan Village in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, has 420 households. Last year, the masses planted more than 6,000 mu of cotton, producing an estimated 900,000 jin of seed cotton. The cotton farmers' lives are gradually becoming prosperous, and now almost every family has a surplus and stores cotton.

  After Making Initial Achievements
        Village Cadres Developed Complacency
    On June 27, the cotton selling and storage work was assigned to this village. The village's Communist Party branch held an emergency mobilization meeting, calling on Party members and cadres to lead by example and motivate the masses to sell and store cotton. Then, mass meetings were held in four areas, proposing the slogan "Selling cotton is a patriotic action to resist America and aid Korea." Under the propaganda and leadership of Party members and cadres, more than 16,000 jin of cotton were sold and stored in five days (not including the cotton sold by the masses in other villages). At this time, Party members and cadres believed that they had met the district's requirement of "selling 80 percent of the stored cotton." The village chief reported to the district that "the task was completed," and the branch secretary also said: "The masses have taken out all their stored cotton. Even if there is a little left, it doesn't matter." Some cadres even blindly estimated: "If you add the cotton sold by the masses in other villages, it will be at least 50,000 or 60,000 jin. This time, the work will not fall behind!" As a result, the cotton selling and storage work stopped again.
  After Investigation, It Was Found That There Was Still a Lot of Stored Cotton
  The Branch Secretary Made a Self-Criticism
    On July 3, the cotton collection work team arrived in the village and first conducted a preliminary investigation of the cotton storage situation. It was found that most of the cotton in the masses' homes had not been taken out, and only a small portion had been sold to buy wheat. Even the village chief himself, who sold 670 jin of stored cotton, only sold half of his family's stored cotton. Cotton farmer Wang Hailing (middle peasant) had 3,200 jin of stored cotton and only sold a fraction of it. Based on this situation, the work team held another meeting of Party members and cadres to conduct ideological mobilization. Using the investigation results, they criticized the cadres' claim that "the masses have no more stored cotton," and emphasized: "In order to support the early start of the yarn mills and thwart the blockade conspiracy of American imperialism, we should try our best to take out the stored cotton and sell it to the state. This is a practical action to resist America, aid Korea, and be patriotic." At the same time, the county's Finance and Economic Committee introduced specific reward measures for carrying out the selection of model villages, model cadres, and model cotton storage households, which increased the cadres' patriotic enthusiasm. Branch Secretary Cheng Desheng reviewed his actions, saying: "In the past, I only sold cotton when I needed money, and I didn't sell it when I didn't need money, only focusing on my own interests. Now I still have 570 jin of cotton, and I will store it all in the state."
  Establish Cotton Selling Organizations and Carry Out Propaganda Work
  Launch a Mass Patriotic Cotton Selling Movement
    On the spot, more than 30 cadres above the administrative team leader level organized a cotton selling and storage committee, with propaganda, organization and mobilization, supervision and inspection, and security sections. Combined with Party members and cadres, they were divided into seven rows to spread patriotic cotton selling and storage propaganda work in the seven villages where the farmers of the village lived scattered. Party member Zhang Congrong and civil school teacher Yu Tongrong encouraged all 28 students in the school to jointly issue a patriotic cotton selling and storage friendly competition challenge to 71 cadres above the village administrative team leader level. All the students unanimously guaranteed that they would sell or store all the cotton to the state within three days, and also mobilize two farmers per person to store cotton. The next day, a student propaganda team was organized on the street, and patriotic slogans and cartoons were posted everywhere on the walls. The streets, food markets, temple platforms, and fields were filled with discussions about resisting America, aiding Korea, and selling patriotic cotton.
  Hold Recollection and Heart-to-Heart Meetings on the Benefits of Planting Cotton
  Cotton Farmers Strengthened Their Patriotic Ideology
    On July 6, each row held recollection and heart-to-heart meetings on the benefits of planting cotton in their respective areas. At the symposium of more than 30 people in the sixth row, village chief Zhang Yinzong talked about the facts of the destruction and plunder of cotton farmers by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionary government, which aroused everyone's sad memories. Cotton farmer Zhang Yunzhi said: "I will never forget the Japanese devils in my life! In order to force the masses to sell cotton, they issued three-part forms for 70 jin of seed cotton per mu. If you didn't sell enough, you had to spend money to buy the difference. They only paid 600 yuan for one jin of cotton worth 1,000 yuan. One hundred jin of cotton couldn't be exchanged for two dou of red sorghum. Who hasn't tasted that bitterness!" Cotton farmer Wang Juling said: "Before liberation, we also grew cotton, and we ate bran and vegetable nests and thin rice soup. Now we also grow cotton, and every family can eat white flour every day. In addition to building houses and adding livestock, which family doesn't have a surplus of stored cotton? Aren't these earth-shaking changes all given to us by the Communist Party and the People's Government? Now that our country needs cotton, we won't sell it even if they pay us money. It's against our conscience. I still have 420 jin of cotton, and I'll store it all in the state today." Center group leader Shen Binglou said: "We can't forget the pain after the wound heals. To protect our good times, we must help the country overcome difficulties. I still have 240 jin of cotton, and I'll take it all out!" At this meeting alone, people immediately reported 100 jin here and 200 jin there, totaling 3,000 or 4,000 jin. After the recollection movement throughout the village, the cotton selling and storage movement was fully launched. Under the lead of Party members, cadres, and civil school students in selling and storing cotton and carrying out propaganda and mobilization, more than 35,000 jin of cotton were sold and stored in three days. Among them, storage accounted for more than 40 percent of the total cotton received.
  Pay Attention to Mobilizing Middle Peasants with More Stored Cotton
  Educate Backward Peasants Through Advanced Middle Peasants
    During this period, some middle peasants with more stored cotton, influenced by the patriotic cotton selling upsurge led by Party members and cadres, also sold some of their stored cotton, but most of them remained reluctant to sell due to fear of revealing their wealth, fear of being borrowed from, and fear that storing money was not safe. They wanted to hide it, but they were also afraid that others would know and say that they had no understanding of the country. They were hesitant, so Party members, cadres, and civil school students divided their work to carry out cotton storage investigations and individual ideological mobilization. Middle peasant Jin Hetang had more than 2,400 jin of seed cotton, but only sold more than 200 jin. At this time, civil school student Wang Shucheng went to mobilize him, and he took out more than 200 jin for the second time. Finally, Wang Qingzhi, a middle peasant who was close to him, explained to him using his own ideological struggle experience in selling cotton, and as a result, he straightened out his thinking and sold all his stored cotton in four times. Middle peasant Jin Futang had more than 1,000 jin of stored cotton, and village cadres mobilized him several times without success. Later, through Wu Ming, who was close to him, he was mobilized, and as a result, he also sold all his stored cotton to the state in several times.

        Many Farm Families Have Women in Control of Cotton
  Greater Achievements Can Only Be Made by Mobilizing Women
    While the cotton selling was in full swing, Wang Tianen, a middle peasant in the sixth row, started fighting with his wife because he wanted to sell and store more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton to the state. Wang Tiantai, a middle peasant, had 1,400 jin of stored cotton, but he couldn't take it out because his wife didn't agree to sell it. In addition, some cotton farmers had their cotton controlled by women and could not make their own decisions. Even cotton farmers whose women were not in charge of the household always wanted to keep some cotton when selling cotton. Based on this situation, the village cotton selling and storage committee decided that if they wanted to sell more cotton from the masses, they must mobilize women. Immediately, village cadres assisted Women's Director Wang Jinping to hold women's symposiums in separate areas, and similarly conducted recollection and heart-to-heart talks. Wang Jinzhi's mother said: "Men know about resisting America and aiding Korea to be patriotic, don't we know? We have suffered enough from the Japanese devils, and we must not let the American devils come to harm us again! I still have 30 jin of lint at home, and I will sell it to resist America and aid Korea." Wang Tiantai's wife saw everyone at the meeting reporting to sell cotton, 100 jin here and 80 jin there, and she was also moved. She said: "I still have some cotton, and in order to protect our good days, I will sell it too." As soon as she changed her mind, Wang Tiantai immediately pulled more than 1,000 jin of cotton to the village cooperative. After the meeting, cadres above the women's association group leader level divided their work to individually mobilize women. Women's Director Wang Jinping mobilized five households in a row, and cotton purchases and storage increased by more than 1,300 jin.

    In this way, the whole village sold and stored 74,290 jin of cotton in fourteen days (excluding seed cotton and cotton sold by the masses in other villages).

　　打破思想障碍，开展群众性售储棉运动！
　  ——河北成安河町村是怎样完成售棉储棉任务的？
　　米荣运
    河北成安县的河町村，是个四百二十户的村庄，去年群众种棉六千余亩，约计产籽棉九十余万斤。棉农生活逐渐富裕，现在差不多家家都有盈余，都有存棉。
  做出初步的成绩以后
        村干部产生自满情绪
    六月二十七日，售棉储棉工作布置到这村，该村中共支部开了紧急动员会议，号召党员、干部以身作则，带动群众售棉储棉。接着又分四片召开了群众大会，提出“卖棉就是抗美援朝的爱国行动”的口号。在党员、干部宣传与带动之下，五天时间售棉储棉一万六千余斤（群众出村卖棉的不在内）。这时，党员、干部便认为已达到区里布置的“存棉卖出百分之八十”的要求，村长向区里汇报“完成了任务”，支部书记也说：“群众存棉都拿出来了，即便剩点也没啥了。”还有的干部盲目地估计说：“要加上群众到外村卖棉，至少有五、六万斤，这回工作可没落了后！”这样，售棉储棉工作便又停了下来。
  调查之后发现存棉还多
  支部书记作了自我批评
    七月三日，收棉工作组到了该村，首先作了个存棉情况的初步调查，发现群众家里的棉花大部分都还没拿出来，卖出的只占一小部分，是为了买麦。甚至村长自己卖出的六百七十斤存棉，也只占家里存棉的一半。棉农王海令（中农）有存棉三千二百斤，只卖了个零数。根据这种情况，工作组又重新召开党员、干部会作了思想动员，并用调查所得材料批判了干部认为“群众没了存棉”的说法，强调提出：“为了支持纱厂早日开工，粉碎美帝国主义封锁阴谋，我们应该尽量地把存棉拿出来卖给国家，这就是抗美援朝和爱国的实际行动。”同时介绍了县财政经济委员会关于开展售棉储棉评选模范村、模范干部、模范储棉户的具体奖励办法，提高了干部爱国热情。支部书记程德生检讨说：“以前我是自己需要钱时才卖棉，不用钱就不卖，只在自己利益上打圈子。现在我还有五百七十斤棉花，全部存到国家。”
  成立售棉组织开展宣传工作
  掀起群众性的爱国售棉运动
    当场由三十余名行政组长以上干部组织起售棉储棉委员会，下设宣传、组织动员、督促检查、保卫四个股，结合党员、干部，分开七个排向该村农民分散居住着的七个庄子展开爱国售棉储棉的宣传工作。党员张从荣和民校教员宇同荣鼓励全校二十八名学员联名向村行政组长以上七十一名干部提出爱国售棉储棉的友谊竞赛挑战，全体学员一致保证在三天以内把棉花全部卖给或存给国家，还要一人动员两户农民存棉。第二天，街头组织了学生宣传队，墙上到处贴满了卖棉爱国的标语口号和漫画。街头、饭市、庙台、地头上到处议论起抗美援朝卖爱国棉的事。
  举行种棉得利回忆谈心会
  棉农加强了爱国主义思想
    七月六日，各排分片召开了群众种棉得利回忆谈心会。六排在三十余名群众的座谈会上，村长张荫宗谈了日寇和国民党反动政府对棉农的摧残掠夺的事实，引起了大家的悲痛回忆。棉农张云芝说：“提起日本鬼子，我一辈子也忘不了！他们为了强制群众卖棉，一亩地按七十斤籽棉给发三联单，卖不够数得花钱买空，一斤棉值一千元卖给他们只得六百元。一百斤棉花换不出二斗红高粱，谁没尝过那个苦头！”棉农王聚领说：“解放以前咱也是种棉，吃的是糠菜窝窝稀米汤，现在咱也是种棉，家家每天都能吃上白面。除了盖房、添牲口，谁家没有盈余存棉？这些翻天覆地的大变化，不都是共产党和人民政府给咱的吗？如今自己的国家需要棉花，用钱买咱都不卖，凭良心也说不过去。我还有四百二十斤花，今天全部存到国家。”中心组长沈丙楼说：“咱不能好了疮忘了疼，要保住咱这好光景，就得帮助国家克服困难，我还有二百四十斤花都拿出来！”光在这个会上，你一百我二百地当场就报了三、四千斤。全村经过回忆运动，售棉储棉运动即全面开展起来。在党员、干部、民校学员的带头售存和宣传动员下，三天内售储棉三万五千余斤。其中储存占总收棉量的百分之四十强。
  注意动员存棉较多的中农
  通过先进中农教育落后的
    在这期间，有些存棉多的中农，在党员、干部带动群众掀起爱国售棉高潮的影响下，也卖出了一部存棉，但大多数因怕露富，怕别人借，怕存钱不保险，仍然观望不前。想要藏起来，又怕别人知道了，说自己对国家没认识，过后再漏出来丢人显眼。正在犹豫不定的时候，党员、干部和民校学员们分工展开存棉调查工作和个别的思想动员工作。中农靳合堂有二千四百多斤籽棉，只卖了二百多斤；这时民校学员王书诚去动员他，第二次又拿出二百多斤。最后，和他相好的中农王庆芝，用自己卖棉的思想斗争经过向他解释，结果搞通了思想，把存棉分四次全部卖了出去。中农靳福堂有一千多斤存棉，村干部动员数次无效，后来通过和他亲近的吴明去动员，结果也分数次把存棉全部卖给国家。
        许多农家是由妇女掌握棉花
  要动员妇女才能有更大成绩
    正在轰轰烈烈卖棉的时候，六排中农王天恩因为要把一千多斤籽棉卖、存给国家，和他的老婆打起架来。中农王天太有一千四百斤存棉，也因为他老婆不同意卖，拿不出来。另外还有些棉农，棉花都掌握在妇女手里，自己做不了主。就是妇女不当家的棉农，在卖棉时妇女也总要留下些棉花。根据这个情况，村售棉储棉委员会决定：要使群众卖出更多的棉花，一定得发动妇女。当即由村干部协助妇女主任王金萍，分片召开妇女座谈会，同样进行回忆谈心。王金芝娘说：“男人都知道抗美援朝爱国，咱就不知道吗？咱受日本鬼子的气受够了，再不让美国鬼子来糟害咱！我家里还剩着三十斤皮棉，卖了它抗美援朝。”王天太的老婆在会上见大伙你一百我八十地自报卖棉，心也动了，说：“俺还有点花，为了保住咱这好日子，俺也卖了它。”她一转变，王天太把一千多斤花便马上拉到村合作社去了。会后，妇女会组长以上干部又分工去个别动员妇女。妇女主任王金萍连着动员了五户，购棉储棉又增加了一千三百多斤。
    全村就这样在十四天中售棉储棉七万四千二百九十斤（籽棉、群众出村卖的不在内）。
