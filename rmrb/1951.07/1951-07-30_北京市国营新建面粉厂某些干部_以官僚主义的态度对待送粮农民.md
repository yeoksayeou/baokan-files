　　Certain Cadres of the Beijing State-Owned Xin Jian Flour Mill
    Treat Farmers Delivering Grain with Bureaucratic Attitudes

Editor:
    The No. 2 factory of the Beijing State-Owned Xin Jian Flour Mill has serious bureaucratic work styles in its responsibility for collecting summer grain loans in Beijing this year, and does not consider the hardships of the masses. Many village cadres responsible for delivering loan grain there have many complaints about this.
    After the start of the summer grain loan collection work in Beijing this year, the masses in various villages in our district showed a high degree of patriotism and enthusiastically delivered grain. The Municipal People's Government stipulated that the grain from various villages in our district should be inspected and accepted by the Xin Jian Flour Mill No. 2 factory. Some villages in our district are very far from the factory, a round trip of over a hundred li. Many village cadres, in order to ensure that the grain is put into storage as soon as possible, set off the night before, delivered the grain of their village to the factory late at night, and spent the night in the open, waiting for weighing the next day. Some village grain deliverers had to rush back to their village late the next night, and both people and livestock had to endure two nights and one day of sun. However, the Xin Jian Flour Mill No. 2 factory did not consider the hardships of the masses at all, and was not responsible for solving problems when they occurred. For example, on July 9, the factory only collected more than 50,000 jin of grain from 9:00 am when the scales opened to 12:00 pm when the scales closed; while there were already forty or fifty carts waiting outside the factory, and the queue was very long. In the scorching sun, the grain deliverers and livestock could not bear it; at that time the weather was about to change and it might rain. Many village cadres delivering grain negotiated with the factory, requesting to hire more grain carrying workers to speed up the weighing. The factory director refused, saying: "In order to resist the US and aid Korea, we should save wage expenditures and cannot increase grain carrying workers." And a Comrade Lu from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau, who was assisting the factory in collecting grain, even said: "If the livestock get sick from the sun, we have veterinarians; if they die from the sun, there is livestock insurance." (These materials were reflected by Zhang Guozhu, the village cadre of Shuanghuaishu Administrative Village in our district who escorted the grain.)
    For example, on July 7, the Landianchang Administrative Village in our district borrowed a large truck from the Changhua Farm, escorted by Village Chief Qi Bingwu, and arrived at the Xin Jian Flour Mill at around 11:00 pm. When delivering the grain the next day, the factory required the truck to drive into the factory before unloading the grain. However, because the truck was too large to drive in, the factory would not allow the workers to unload the grain. Village Chief Qi Bingwu had no choice but to carry the grain into the factory himself. He vomited blood after carrying a few bags. The factory guard could not bear to watch and helped him carry a few bags; the factory grain carrying workers were also willing to unload the grain, but did not get permission from the factory. Later, the people's police sent by the police station to maintain traffic and the cadres from various villages delivering grain learned about this situation and raised their opinions to the factory, and the factory allowed the workers to unload the grain on their behalf.
    This bureaucratic work style of the factory has already had a very bad impact on many village cadres. We suggest that the factory quickly check its work and make a public self-criticism.
        Finance Section of the Beijing 13th District People's Government

    Editor's note: The Xin Jian Flour Mill should thoroughly investigate the bureaucratic work style of the No. 2 factory, and deal with it, in order to recover the adverse effects caused among the masses.

### 北京市国营新建面粉厂某些干部  以官僚主义的态度对待送粮农民

　　北京市国营新建面粉厂某些干部
    以官僚主义的态度对待送粮农民编辑同志：
    北京市国营新建面粉厂第二厂在负责代收北京市今年夏季借征小麦工作中有着严重的官僚主义作风，不体贴群众疾苦。很多负责往那里送借征粮的村干部对此很有意见。
    北京市今年夏季借征小麦工作开始后，我区各村群众表现了高度的爱国主义精神，纷纷踊跃交粮。市人民政府规定，我区各村粮食由新建面粉二厂验收。我区有些村距该厂很远，往返百余里。很多村干部为了争取使粮食早日入库，就在头一天晚上驾车出发，在深夜把本村粮食送到该厂，露宿通宵，等待第二天过秤。有些村的送粮人要到第二天深夜才能赶回本村，人和牲口都得熬两夜、晒一天。但新建面粉二厂对群众疾苦却毫不体贴照顾，在发生问题时也不负责解决。如七月九日，该厂从早晨九时开秤到十二时停秤为止，只收了五万多斤粮食；而厂外等着的大车已有四五十辆，队伍排的很长。在火热的太阳下，送粮的人和牲口都受不了；当时天气要变，可能下雨。很多送粮的村干部向厂方交涉，要求多雇扛粮工人，加快过秤。厂长不肯，说：“我们为了抗美援朝，应该节省工资支出，不能增加扛粮工人。”而北京市人民政府财政局协同该厂收粮的一位卢同志竟说：“如果牲口晒病了，我们有兽医；晒死了，有牲畜保险。”（这些材料是我区双槐树行政村押送粮食的村干部张国柱反映的。）
    又如七月七日我区蓝靛厂行政村借了彰化农场的大卡车，由齐丙武村长押送，在夜十一时左右抵达新建面粉厂。第二天交粮时，厂方要卡车开进厂后才肯卸粮。但因卡车过大，开不进去；厂方就不让工人卸粮。齐丙武村长没法，只好自己把粮扛进厂去。他扛了几包，压得吐血了。该厂岗警看不过，帮他扛了几包；该厂扛粮工人也愿意卸粮，但得不到厂方允许。后来派出所派来维持交通的人民警察和各村送粮的干部知道这个情况，向厂方提出了意见，厂方才允许工人代卸。
    该厂这种官僚主义作风，已经在很多村干部中造成了很坏的影响。我们建议该厂迅速检查工作，并作公开检讨。
        北京市第十三区人民政府财政科
    编者按：新建面粉厂应彻查该厂第二厂的官僚主义作风，并作处理，以挽回在群众中所造成的恶劣影响。
