    Experience in Cotton Purchase and Storage
    Liu Haishi
    Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions and appeals on cotton purchase and storage work on June 1, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the cotton production center of North China, established cotton purchase committees at all levels, organized joint purchases, leveled the listed prices with market prices, mobilized cadres to take the lead in storing and selling cotton, and carried out extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization in conjunction with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. By the end of mid-June, the entire prefecture had purchased and stored more than 3 million jin of unginned cotton, equivalent to more than 800,000 jin of ginned cotton. Wang Laoduan, a cotton farmer in Dongli Village, Gaocheng, had stored cotton for four or five years and reported more than 10,000 jin this time. Zhang Dayuan reported more than 5,000 jin. In Hanjialou Village, District 3, Zhengding, 43 households sold more than 10,000 jin of cotton under the leadership of the Communist Party branch secretary and village chief. Cotton farmers in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City sold cotton collectively in groups, with flags reading "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Patriotic Cotton Sales" inserted in the cotton bales, forming a vigorous cotton sales movement. In the markets of the prefecture, the amount of cotton on the market increased significantly in mid-June compared to early June. The markets in Zhengding and Nanbo Tan Village in Jin County increased tenfold in mid-June compared to early June. Xiaoqiao Village in Jin County increased seven or eight times. The acquisition figures for the first half of June in most areas were close to the acquisition figures for the entire month of May. The Lecheng team exceeded the acquisition volume of May by 30 percent.

    In the process of carrying out cotton purchase and storage work, preliminary experience has been gained:

    1.  The organization of forces by leading cadres at all levels and unified allocation is a prerequisite for the victorious development of work. In the cotton purchase and storage work in this prefecture, cadres such as county party committee secretaries, county heads, district party committee secretaries, district heads, village branch secretaries, and village chiefs all personally served as directors of the cotton purchase committee to lead this work. Government organs, mass organizations, economic, and cultural departments at all levels all called on cadres to take the lead, conduct in-depth publicity, and concretely implement cotton purchase and storage policies among the masses through their respective organizational systems. As a result, a mass patriotic cotton sales and storage movement was created.

    2.  Extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization, combined with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, emphasizing that selling and storing cotton is a patriotic act, opening up the minds of the masses, and enhancing patriotic enthusiasm are the basic keys to the smooth development of work. This is how a mass movement of selling and storing cotton was created in Shulu County and the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City. The specific situation in the movement shows that as long as the sale and storage of cotton is linked to resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, the thinking of many grassroots cadres and cotton farmers will quickly be opened up, and the problem will be solved readily. However, in response to the masses' thinking of "fear of revealing wealth" and reluctance to sell in anticipation of price increases, it is also necessary to do some specific explanatory and educational work, clarify the state's policies, and explain the reasons why selling and storing cotton is beneficial to the country and beneficial to oneself.

    3.  Strict and effective management of the market and the organization of joint purchases are also important links. Various places have implemented market management and established joint purchase organizations, leveling the listed prices and market prices, so that the company's purchase volume generally accounted for more than 80 percent of the amount of cotton on the market, which shows that market regulation must be carried out to ensure the completion of the purchase task. However, market management must be closely combined with the education of private merchants and peddlers, otherwise there will be some side effects. At the beginning, Jin County only strictly controlled the market and did not educate the peddlers. The peddlers instigated the masses, saying, "I offer a higher price, but the government does not allow me to buy." This aroused the masses' dissatisfaction with the government. Later, the county focused on educating the peddlers, explaining to the peddlers the reason why they should help the state carry out purchases, participate in joint purchases, and buy at the state price, and explaining that everyone has a responsibility to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend the country and protect their homes. Private merchants and peddlers began to obey management, participate in joint purchases, no longer said strange things, and the masses' emotions were stabilized, and the market quickly became stable. In addition, it is also necessary to pay close attention to analyzing circulation situations to avoid the occurrence of reverse flow and chaotic flow.

    4.  Mobilization must be based on investigation in order to achieve practical results. Mobilization without investigation is blind mobilization. First, do a side investigation, grasp the situation, and then conduct targeted in-depth mobilization, and the effect will be great. However, one should not mechanically emphasize that the investigation must be "accurate in every detail, without any mistakes" before proceeding with mobilization. Rather, mobilization should be combined with investigation, so as to "shoot the arrow at the target."

    5.  In addition, carrying out letter-writing campaigns among cadres, mobilizing family members and relatives to sell and store cotton, and systematically mobilizing cadres, the masses, and activists to take the lead in selling and storing cotton, or launching self-reporting at meetings, are all good methods. However, one point must be noted: the figures reported by those who take the lead in self-reporting must be accurate. If those who report first report inaccurately, it will have side effects.

　　河北省石家庄专区
    购棉储棉工作经验
    刘海石
    自六月一日中央人民政府政务院、中共中央发出关于购棉储棉工作的指示、号召后，华北产棉中心石家庄区成立了各级购棉委员会，组织联购，拉平了牌价与市价，发动干部带头存、售棉花，结合抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，广泛深入地进行宣传动员。至六月中旬之末，全专区已购存籽棉三百余万斤，折皮棉八十余万斤。藁城东里村棉农王老端存棉四、五年，这次报出一万多斤。张大远自报五千多斤。正定三区韩家楼村，四十三户在中共支部书记、村长带动下，售出棉花一万多斤。石家庄市郊区棉农曾成群结队集体售棉，棉包上插着“抗美援朝爱国售棉”的旗子，形成轰轰烈烈的售棉运动。专区各市场上，棉花上市量，中旬较上旬有显著增加。正定各市场及晋县南泊摊村，中旬比上旬增加十倍。晋县小樵村增加七、八倍。大部地区六月上半月收购数字已接近五月全月收购数字。乐城小组则超过五月收购量百分之三十。
    在开展购棉储棉工作过程中，已取得初步经验：
    一、各级领导干部多方组织力量，统一配备，是胜利开展工作的先决条件。该专区在购储棉工作中，各县县委、县长、区委、区长、村支部书记、村长等干部，皆亲自担任购棉委员会主任，领导这一工作。各级政权机关、群众团体、经济、文化部门，都通过各自组织系统，号召干部起带头作用，深入宣传，把购、储棉政策具体贯彻到群众中去。因而造成了群众性的爱国售、存棉运动。
    二、广泛深入的宣传动员，结合抗美援朝保家卫国运动，强调提出售、存棉花是爱国行为，打通群众思想，提高爱国热忱，是工作顺利开展的基本关键。束鹿县和石家庄市郊区，都是这样造成了售、存棉花的群众运动。运动中的具体情况显示：只要把售、储棉花和抗美援朝联系起来，许多基层干部和棉农群众的思想很快就打通了，问题就爽利地得到了解决。但是，针对群众“怕露富”，看涨惜售的思想情况，也还需要做一些具体的解释教育工作，阐明国家的政策，说明售、存棉花对国家有功，对自己有利的道理。
    三、严格有效地管理市场，组织联购，也是重要环节。各地实行管理市场，成立了联购组织，拉平了牌价和市价，使公司收购量普遍作到棉花上市量的百分之八十多，这就说明必须管制市场，才能保障完成收购任务。但市场管理要紧紧结合对私商小贩的教育，否则会有部分的副作用。晋县开始时只严格管制市场，未对小贩进行教育，小贩即挑动群众说：“我出的价大，政府不让我买。”激起群众对政府不满。后来该县抓紧教育小贩，向小贩说明应该帮助国家进行收购、参加联购，随国家牌价收买的道理，说明抗美援朝卫国保家是人人有责，私商小贩开始服从管理，参加联购，不再讲怪话，群众情绪也安定了，市场很快走向了稳定。另外还须很好注意分析流转情况，避免发生倒流、乱流的现象。
    四、动员时要有调查，才能收到实际效果。没有调查的动员，是盲目的动员。先做好侧面调查，掌握了情况，再作有目标的深入动员，收效就会很大。但不应机械强调先调查得“分毫不差，点滴无错”再进行动员。而是要动员结合调查。做到“有的放矢”。
    五、另外，在干部中开展写信运动，动员家属、亲友售、存棉花，以及有计划地发动干部群众积极分子带头售、存棉花，或在会议上发动自报，都是较好的办法。但须注意一点：要使带头自报者所报数字确实。先报者报得不实，即会起副作用。
