    Never Relax Vigilance Against Counter-Revolutionaries!
    Multiple Arson Cases by Special Agents Occur in Huangchuan County, Henan; Illegal Elements Damage Autumn Seedlings in Xiawan Village, Queshan

    To the Editors:
    Recently, arson incidents destroying civilian houses by special agents have continuously occurred in Huangchuan County, Henan Province. These incidents should attract the attention of all regions.

    On the afternoon of June 3rd, Zhang, the wife of Chen Xiangzhen, a local tyrant landlord who had been detained by the government in Fengyingzi Village, Shangyougang Township, Fifth District of Huangchuan County, took advantage of the neighbors going to the fields to cut wheat and set fire to five nearby houses, destroying more than 1,200 catties of wheat, more than 150 catties of rapeseed, more than 120 catties of sesame, soybeans, and mung bean seeds, 39 pieces of farm tools, and 37 pieces of clothing and 7 quilts. In addition, arson incidents by special agents also occurred successively in Yu Dazhuangzi in Guihua Township, Fudianji in Fudian Township, Sixth District, Huqiao Township, Tuwa in Tupeng Township, Leftwa in Chengang Township, and Yang Xiaoweizi in Zhouzhai Township, Seventh District. These incidents have caused great losses to farmers' property. Among them, Zhang Binggui, a farmer in Zhouzhai Township, had 26 houses, more than 5,000 catties of wheat, and all his clothes and farm tools burned down.

    The reasons for these incidents are, on the one hand, that it is currently the busy farming season, and farmers are busy with drought resistance and emergency planting, and rarely at home, giving counter-revolutionary elements an opportunity to take advantage of; but the main reason is that some township cadres believe that counter-revolutionary elements have been suppressed in various places with great fanfare, and bad guys have been suppressed, thus generating a "relief" and "nothing much" mentality of carelessness. These incidents have taught us that we must thoroughly correct the careless thinking, raise vigilance at all times, and strictly prevent similar incidents from happening in order to safeguard the people's fruits of victory.

    To the Editors:
    In Xiawan Village, Lizhuang Township, Seventh District of Queshan County, Henan Province, an incident of illegal elements damaging autumn seedlings occurred late at night on June 14th. The autumn seedlings of corn belonging to Wang Rongzhi, the farmers' representative of the village, had already grown lush and green to three feet high. Unexpectedly, nearly 300 plants were chopped down by illegal elements that night.

    It is currently the busy farming season. Farmers are busy all day during the day and need to rest at night. Illegal elements take advantage of this gap and seize the opportunity to sabotage. Therefore, the township people's governments in various regions must overcome the careless thinking of believing that everything is peaceful and raise vigilance, conscientiously organize militia to protect autumn seedlings, and severely suppress sabotage elements.

    对反革命不能放松警惕！
    河南潢川县发生特务纵火案多起确山夏湾村有不法分子破坏秋苗编辑同志：
    河南省潢川县最近不断发生特务放火烧毁民房事件。这些事件应当引起各地注意。
    六月三日下午，潢川县五区上油岗乡冯营孜村已被政府扣押的恶霸地主陈祥贞之妻张氏，乘邻居下地割麦之机，放火烧毁附近房子五间，小麦一千二百多斤，菜籽一百五十余斤，芝麻、黄豆、绿豆种籽一百二十多斤，农具三十九件及衣服三十七件、被子七件。此外，二区桂花乡余大庄孜、傅店乡傅店集，六区胡桥乡，七区涂棚乡涂洼、陈岗乡左洼，周寨乡杨小围孜等处也先后发生特务放火事件。这些事件使农民财产受到很大损失，其中周寨乡农民张秉贵即被烧掉房子二十六间，小麦五千余斤，衣裳农具等全部。
    发生这些事件的原因，一方面是现在正值农忙时期，农民忙于抗旱、抢种等工作，在家时候很少，使反革命分子有机可乘；但主要的是部分乡干部认为各地大张旗鼓镇压了反革命分子，坏家伙都被镇压下去了，因而产生了“松口气”、“没有啥”的麻痹思想。这些事件已经教训了我们，必须彻底纠正麻痹思想，时时刻刻提高警惕，严防同类事情发生，以保卫人民的胜利果实。
        潢川县人民政府  孙博甫、赵培恭编辑同志：
    河南省确山县七区李庄乡夏湾村在六月十四日深夜发生不法分子破坏秋苗的事情。该村农民代表王荣芝的秋苗玉蜀黍，已经绿油油地长得三尺高，不料在那天晚上被不法分子砍坏将近三百棵。
    现在正值农忙季节。农民白天忙了一天，晚上急需休息，不法分子就钻这个空子，乘机破坏。因此，各地区乡人民政府，必须克服自以为太平无事的麻痹思想，提高警惕，认真组织民兵保护秋苗，给破坏分子以严厉镇压。
