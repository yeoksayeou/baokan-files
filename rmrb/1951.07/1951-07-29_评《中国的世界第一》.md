　　Review of "China's World Firsts"
　　Tu Kang
　　Starting from the beginning of this year, Shanghai Dagongbao has opened a special column called "China's World Firsts," continuously publishing numerous materials showcasing our motherland's long history, abundant resources, and the wisdom and diligence of the Chinese people. These materials have been selected and edited by the newspaper and published in a collection. The first volume was published in early March of this year, with a fourth edition in May; the second volume was published in early May. Similar materials continue to be published in the newspaper. At the same time, the newspaper also has a column called "China's Local and Special Products," introducing local and special products from various regions. These materials have also begun to be compiled and published in single volumes (the first volume published in early June). Due to the long-term reactionary and dark rule of old China, and the intrusion of the decadent culture of imperialism, the various superior contributions in our country's history have long been buried and unheard of. Moreover, over a hundred years of semi-feudal and semi-colonial rule have caused some people to lose their national self-esteem. Now, due to the victory of the revolution and the achievements of various constructions, our country has become one of the strong pillars of world peace. We should re-evaluate the long-buried national property in a correct manner. Therefore, the work of Dagongbao is commendable. In order to make this work better, we would like to offer some suggestions on "China's World Firsts" here.

　　From the two volumes that have been published, this work has made achievements. Preliminary explorations have been made regarding China's superior natural conditions, the labor creations of ancient people, and other aspects, helping readers to understand the greatness of our motherland from concrete facts. However, these two volumes also have their shortcomings, which can be discussed from the aspects of material selection and content.

　　In terms of material selection, we first feel that the theme title "China's World Firsts" needs to be changed. Because although some of the creations and inventions of the Chinese people are indeed world firsts, such as the compass, gunpowder, and printing technology in history, which are recognized by the world, it is difficult to compare some great figures and events to determine whether they are the first or second in the world. Historical figures such as Yue Fei and Lin Zexu, historical events such as the May Fourth Movement and the birth of the Communist Party of China, and current movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the Huai River project, these figures, events, and movements are undoubtedly great and worthy of the Chinese people's pride, but it is difficult to find an appropriate standard to measure them in the world. Therefore, using the title "China's World Firsts" cannot completely encompass China's great things. Moreover, many things that are not world firsts are even more significant than the things listed in "World Firsts." For example, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the world's most powerful army, second only to the Soviet Red Army, and it has a profound impact on the fate of the world's people; the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War is also a great victory of world significance, second only to the Soviet Union's victory in the war against German and Japanese fascism; Chairman Mao's theory on the Chinese revolution is an important component of the theoretical treasure trove guiding the revolutionary struggles of the world's people; and the construction undertakings of the new China in various fields are also valuable experiences in the world revolutionary movement.

　　Secondly, some people criticize this book for collecting too few materials about modern times, and we believe that this opinion is correct. In addition, we also believe that it only focuses on collecting economic and cultural materials, while neglecting political materials. In the former, the work of stabilizing prices and consolidating currency carried out by China after a long period of destruction and currency inflation is the world's first in terms of scale and speed. In the latter, for example, the victory of the revolution in a large country with nearly 500 million people, the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which exposed the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism, are all extremely great events in the world; the 25,000-li Long March is the world's first great feat in military history; and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was also the world's first in terms of the scale of peasant revolutionary movements in past history.

　　Again, some of the materials collected in this book do not have special significance. For example, "Weiqi (Go)," "Pandas," "Skills," "White Wax," "Davidia involucrata," "Cabbage," and "Citrus," etc. Some of these things can be collected in collections with other themes (such as "China's Local and Special Products"), and do not need to be listed as "World Firsts." All things called world firsts should be limited to those that have a certain significance in the progress of world history, because the history and natural conditions of countries around the world are different, and each country can cite many unique things, but certainly not everything is great.

　　In terms of content shortcomings, the first is that the textual research is too cumbersome, and some of the textual research is also wrong. For example, the textual research of "Luanzhou Shadow Play" says: "Emperor Wu of Han used a lamp to project the shadow of his lover on the tent," which is very boring; "Jialiang (Standard Measure)" quotes many ancient books, but it is difficult for readers to know what "Jialiang" is; "Lacquerware" is full of textual research, but it does not explain its significance in Chinese history; "Embroidery" is also full of textual research, and does not explain its value. "Weiqi (Go)" actually praises Wu Qingyuan, who joined the Japanese nationality during the War of Resistance Against Japan, which is a politically inappropriate mistake. The explanation of "Tungsten" says: "The average output from 1935 to 1939 was about 10,000 metric tons, and the external sales volume was also the same," which is a manifestation of the backwardness of old China that talented people could not be used, how can it be used as praise material? The explanation of "Bronze Ware" says "China's Bronze Age came the earliest," but according to existing classics, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and India entered the Bronze Age earlier than China; the explanation of "Wheat" believes that the appearance of wheat was the earliest in China, but according to existing historical materials, Egypt also had wheat earlier than China.

　　Secondly, some explanations are inevitably exaggerated and violate the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. For example, the "Abacus" certainly demonstrates the creation of ancient Chinese people in mathematics, but it is not necessary to give an example of a certain overseas Chinese using the abacus to overwhelm an American who uses a computer, implying that the abacus is better than the computer. Furthermore, the prevalence of ancient Chinese paper money is not entirely the result of developed commerce (it was a tool of exploitation by the feudal ruling class), and this cannot be praised uncritically.

　　Thirdly, praising the great creative power of the Chinese people should not create a narrow sense of national arrogance; we should despise and scorn the imperialists, but we cannot erase the creations of the people of other countries. The explanation of "Ceramics" in this book says: "In our opinion, Europeans can be said to be ignorant children of pottery clay," which is an incorrect kind of arrogance. European application of ceramics is relatively backward, how could it be described as "ignorant children"?

　　Finally, many of the explanatory texts in this book are very grammatically confusing. In order to make this book a more complete book, it should also be revised.

　　评《中国的世界第一》
　　屠康
    上海大公报从今年年初起，特辟《中国的世界第一》专栏，连续发表了许多资料，表现我们祖国历史的悠久、物产的富饶以及我国人民的智慧与勤劳。这些资料并经该报选择编辑出版，第一集在今年三月初出版，五月四版；第二集五月初版。同类的资料还在该报继续发表。同时，该报另有《中国的土特产》专栏，介绍各地土、特产品。这些资料也已开始编印单册出版（第一册六月初版）。由于旧中国长期反动、黑暗的统治，和帝国主义的腐烂文化的侵入，我国历史上种种优越贡献，曾经长久地被埋没不闻。而一百多年来半封建半殖民地的统治，更使一部分人丧失了民族自尊心。现在，由于革命的胜利和各项建设的成就，我国已经成为强大的世界和平的支柱之一。我们应该把久被埋没了的民族财产，重新加以正确的估量。因此，大公报的这种工作，是值得称赞的。为了使这一个工作做的更好，我们愿在这里对《中国的世界第一》提一些意见。
    从已经刊行的两册书来看，这个工作是做得有成绩的。关于中国自然条件的优越，古代人民的劳动创造，以及其他等等都有了初步的发掘，帮助读者从具体事实认识到我们祖国的伟大。可是这两册书也还有它的缺点，这可从选材和内容两方面来讲。
    在选材方面，我们首先觉得《中国的世界第一》这个主题名称需要加以改变。因为固然中国人民有一些创造发明确是世界第一，如历史上的指南针，火药，印刷术等是世人公认的，但是有一些伟大的人物与事件，在世界上却很难比较出第一或第二的位置来。历史人物如岳飞、林则徐，历史事件如五四运动、中国共产党的产生，眼前的运动如抗美援朝、镇压反革命、治淮工程等，这些人物、事件、运动，毫无疑义是伟大的，值得中国人民夸耀的，但在世界上很难找出一个适当的标准加以衡量。因此，用《中国的世界第一》这个题目，反而不能把中国的伟大事物概括得完全。而且有许多并非世界第一的事物却比起“世界第一”中所列的事物意义还更伟大。例如中国人民解放军是仅次于苏联红军的世界最强大的军队，它对世界人类的命运有着深远的影响；中国人民解放战争的胜利也是仅次于苏联反对德日法西斯战争胜利的具有世界意义的伟大胜利；毛主席关于中国革命的学说是指导世界人民革命斗争的理论宝库中的重要构成部分；新中国各方面建设事业，也是世界革命运动中的可贵的经验。
    其次，有人批评这部书所收集的关于现代的材料太少，我们认为这个意见是正确的。另外，我们还以为它只着重收集了经济与文化资料，而忽略了政治资料。在前者，中国经历了长期破坏和通货膨涨之后所进行的稳定物价、整理通货工作，不论规模和速度都是世界第一。而在后者，例如在近五万万人口的大国革命的胜利，揭穿美帝国主义纸老虎的抗美援朝战争，都是世界上极伟大的事件；二万五千里长征，是世界军事史上的第一伟迹，是世界第一；太平天国在过去历史上的农民革命运动的规模上，也是世界第一。
    再次，本书收集的材料，有些并没有特别意义。例如“围棋”、“熊猫”、“技艺”、“白腊”、“珙桐”、“白菜”、“柑橘”等。这些东西有的可以收集在用别的主题为名的集子中（例如《中国的土特产》），而不必列为“世界第一”。凡称为世界第一，应以在世界历史进步中有一定意义者为限，因为世界各国历史和自然条件都不相同，独有之物各国都可举出很多，但绝非一切都是伟大的。
    在内容的缺点方面，首先是考证太繁琐，有的考证还有错误。例如“滦州影”的考证说：“汉武帝用灯在帐上照出他爱人的影子”，这是很无聊的；“嘉量”引了很多的古书，读者却很难知道什么是“嘉量”；“漆器”通篇是考证，却没有说明它在中国历史上有什么意义；“刺绣”也全是考证，没有说明它有什么价值。“围棋”居然表扬在抗日战争时期归入日本籍的吴清源，这是政治上不应有的错误。“钨”的说明中说：“从一九三五年到一九三九年的平均产量约在一万公吨左右，外销量也如上数”，楚材不能楚用，这是旧中国落后的表现，如何能作表扬的材料？“青铜器”的说明说“中国青铜器时代到来得最早”，但从现有典籍看，古埃及、古希腊及印度都比中国较早地进入青铜器时代；“麦”的说明以为麦的出现以中国为最早，但就现有史料看，埃及有麦也比中国早。
    其次，有的说明未免夸张，违反科学的实事求是的态度。如“算盘”固然表现了中国古代人民在数理上的创造，但如把某华侨使用算盘压倒使用计算机的美国人一事举出来，暗示算盘比计算机还好，就不必要。又如中国古代纸币的盛行，不完全是商业发达的结果（它是封建统治阶级一种剥削的工具），这不能无批判地加以表扬。
    再次，表扬中国人民的伟大创造力量，不可造成狭隘的民族自大心理；我们应该卑视和蔑视帝国主义者，却不可抹杀他国人民的创造。本书的“陶瓷器”的说明中写道：“在我们看来，欧洲人对陶土可以说是无知的幼孩”，就是一种不正确的自大，欧洲应用陶瓷比较落后，何至被形容为“无知的幼孩”呢？
    最后，本书有许多说明文字在文法上十分混乱，为了使本书成为比较完整的书，也应该把它加以修正。
