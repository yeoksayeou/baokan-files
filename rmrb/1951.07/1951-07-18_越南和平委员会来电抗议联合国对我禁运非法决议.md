Vietnam Peace Committee Cables Protest Against the United Nations' Illegal Resolution on Embargo Against Us
To the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression:
    On behalf of all Vietnamese soldiers and people who are fighting the French aggressors and American interventionists to win national independence and defend world peace, we express our indignation at the United Nations' illegal resolution to impose an embargo on China.
    After fabricating the absurd farce of falsely accusing the People's Republic of China of being an "aggressor," the United Nations once again exposed itself as a war tool of American imperialism.
    We must resolutely expose the masks of the imperialists and warmongers, arouse the hatred of all Vietnamese people towards them, launch a production increase campaign, actively eliminate the enemy, and devote ourselves to the movement initiated by President Ho Chi Minh to accelerate the transition from long-term resistance to the stage of general counter-offensive.
          Lê Đình Thám, Chairman of the Vietnam Peace Committee
            June 3, 1951, in Vietnam

　　越南和平委员会来电抗议联合国对我禁运非法决议中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会：
    谨代表正在向法国侵略者及美国干涉者进行斗争，以争取民族独立及保卫世界和平的全体越南战士和人民，对联合国对中国实行禁运的非法决议，表示我们的忿怒。
    联合国在制造了诬蔑中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的荒谬丑剧之后，再一次自行揭露了它是美帝国主义者的战争工具。
    我们要坚决拆穿帝国主义者及战争贩子们的假面具，掀起全体越南人民对他们的仇恨，开展增产竞赛，积极消灭敌人，投入胡志明主席所发动的加速从长期抵抗进入总反攻阶段的运动。
          越南和平委员会主席  黎庭探
            一九五一年六月三日于越南
