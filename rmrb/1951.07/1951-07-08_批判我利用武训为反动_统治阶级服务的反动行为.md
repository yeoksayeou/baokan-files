Criticizing My Reactionary Behavior of Serving the Reactionary Ruling Class by Utilizing Wu Xun
He Siyuan

I.

When I was young, I was a poor student. I was able to enter university because of the financial help I received from others. Later, I passed the exam for publicly funded study abroad and climbed smoothly up the ladder, eventually reaching the ranks of the reactionary ruling class. In 1928, I became the head of the pseudo-education department of Shandong Province, where I worked for nineteen years (seventeen years as department head and two years as provincial chairman).

I had known about Wu Xun in Shandong for a long time, but I didn't pay much attention to him. Later, someone gave me a book about Wu Xun's deeds, and after reading it briefly, I realized there was an opportunity to be seized. Although I still didn't know the details of Wu Xun's character, I realized that Wu Xun could be utilized.

So, under the guise of inspection, I set off for Liulin Town in Tangyi County. First, I visited Wu Xun Primary School (formerly "Chongxian Yixue"), then I paid my respects at Wu Xun's tomb, and then I met Wu Xun's nephew (or maybe his grand-nephew), offering condolences and encouragement. After that, I went to Guantao County to see the second primary school founded by Wu Xun (formerly "Guantao Yang'erzhuang Yixue"). Finally, I arrived at Yushixiang in Linqing County to see the largest Wu Xun Primary School (formerly "Linqing Yushixiang Yixue"). I found the donation lists of these schools from the past and looked through them. The donation lists were very thick and old, with many names of donors from older times being copied, but the names of modern donors were mostly handwritten. Although I have forgotten the amount of the donations now, I was indeed surprised by the large numbers at the time! I don't remember the names of the donors, but I do remember that there were governors, vice ministers, military governors, provincial chairmen, wealthy gentry, prominent officials, scholars, and celebrities, in short, either bureaucrats, warlords, or feudal landlords. After reading the entire list, I immediately signed and donated five hundred yuan, and generously promised to change Wu Xun Primary School into Wu Xun Middle School, with substantial subsidies and assistance from the provincial government. I also proposed to vigorously promote the "Wu Xun spirit" and print and distribute "The Biography of Wu Xun" and his portraits.

II.

After getting these initial impressions, I always pondered what kind of person Wu Xun was on the way back to Jinan. At that time, my thinking was roughly as follows: 1. Wu Xun's school management was in line with my own interests, that is, helping us train talents, so it was worth praising and commending. 2. At that time, on the political stage in Shandong, people engaged in education were discriminated against everywhere. The Provincial Department of Education, the County Education Section, etc., were all regarded as unimportant institutions, and people engaged in education were regarded as insignificant. Promoting Wu Xun could raise the status of the education sector and comfort and encourage colleagues. 3. In the name of promoting the "Wu Xun spirit," I could ask the provincial government for more education funds to expand my personal educational achievements. 4. By means of the "Wu Xun spirit," I could encourage students to study hard, so that they would be content and not cause disturbances. 5. By means of the "Wu Xun spirit," I could urge educational staff to work hard, not to be concerned about salary and hours, so that the school would be stable and my work could go smoothly. 6. By means of the movement to promote the "Wu Xun spirit," I could raise my own status and consolidate my position.

Recalling my childhood, I often heard my grandmother say: "A dipper-sized golden seal, a white jade hall as high as the sky, how can you accompany the king without reading ten thousand volumes of books?" She also said, "All other professions are inferior, only studying is noble." At that time, I had the illusion of "riding in a sedan chair carried by eight people" and envied the luxury and wealth of the ruling class. But I thought my family was very poor, so there was no possibility of realizing it. Now I have actually achieved my wish, becoming a "high official" through personal hard work. Isn't this the concrete realization of the "Wu Xun spirit"? I felt that the "Wu Xun spirit" was consistent with the spirit taught by my grandmother. This is also one of the reasons why I worked hard to promote the "Wu Xun spirit."

III.

My report to Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary government was relatively simple. But I spoke in great detail to Han Fuju (the then-pseudo-chairman of Shandong Province – a local emperor). I said, "Wu Xun's character is gentle and docile, humble and polite. Wu Xun runs education based on the Three Cardinal Guides and the Five Constant Virtues, the education of heaven, earth, monarch, parents, and teachers, and the education of respecting teachers, Confucius, and valuing morality. Promoting the 'Wu Xun spirit' is helpful to us." Han Fuju was smarter than me and understood more. He said, "The people in the Luxi area are tough and unruly, with 'bandits' everywhere, and they have not been wiped out in past dynasties. If all the poor people were like Wu Xun, it would not be difficult to govern Luxi." At that time, Han Fuju was focusing on "suppressing bandits" and was most concerned about the "bandits" in Luxi. So he decided to use the capitulationist Wu Xun, who was obsequious and groveling, to transform the customs of Luxi, using the "Wu Xun spirit" of "knowing etiquette, not offending superiors, and not rebelling" to correct the "valiant spirit" of the local people and put them "on the right track." His intention was to use the "Wu Xun spirit" to reduce the source of "bandits." In Han Fuju's mind, he thought that if "poor people" could all be like Wu Xun, bowing and kowtowing to the feudal ruling class, not resisting or fighting, and following the path taken by Wu Xun, with the goal of studying and advancing, "then the world in Shandong would be as stable as Mount Tai." Han Fuju's thought accurately represented the thought of the reactionary ruling class. No wonder the donation lists of Wu Xun schools were almost all names of bureaucrats, landlords, gentry, and celebrities! Han Fuju and I had far-reaching and sinister intentions in promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" movement.

IV.

From then on, I realized the mystery of it even more. Once, someone told me: "A certain day in a certain month in the winter of 1934 is the anniversary of Wu Xun's birth." I knew that a propaganda opportunity had come, and I could seize the opportunity to do a great job. I first reprinted "The Biography of Wu Xun" and his portraits and distributed them to all parts of the province and all schools, ordering all schools in the province to use Wu Xun's life deeds as teaching materials for middle schools and to include Wu Xun's stories in elementary school textbooks. I also ordered all public education institutions in the province to step up the promotion of the "Wu Xun spirit." I prepared to hold an expanded memorial meeting for Wu Xun in Linqing County in 1934. I also purchased a large piece of white marble in Fangshan County, Hebei, and asked someone to make a statue of Wu Xun. On one hand, I used the name of the provincial government to send telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek, the pseudo-Ministry of Education, and various "important people" across the country, soliciting plaques, praises, and other commendatory items. I also notified schools, educational institutions, county, district, township, and town supervisors, and local gentry and celebrities in more than twenty counties in northwestern Shandong to attend at that time. I remember that the plaque sent by Chiang Kai-shek was "A Model Teacher." Two days before the meeting, I took Chiang Kai-shek's plaque and the Wu Xun statue made of white marble, and led many school principals and heads of educational institutions from the provincial capital to Linqing first. If I remember correctly, Dong Weichuan, Li Shizhao, Zhang Yuanheng, Zhang Mosheng, Han Duofeng, Sha Mingyuan, and others were also present at the meeting.

At that time, my large-scale propaganda was half true and half false; in my heart, I admired "Wu Xun's character" on one hand, but suspected that Wu Xun was a madman or a mentally ill person on the other. But it was rare that this kind of person with soft knees gave us (the reactionary ruling class) a lot of help, especially helping me personally even more. We should "thank this gentleman!"

V.

In 1935, a Mr. Li in Jinan came to tell me: "There are rumors outside that you are the reincarnation of Wu Xun, I don't know if it's true? You can calculate your birthday." I originally didn't believe in reincarnation, but I felt that this kind of rumor was beneficial to me, so I counted that Wu Xun died in 1896, and I was born in 1896, so I said, "That's right." But I didn't dare to calculate in more detail, fearing that if the month, day, and time were wrong, it would be bad. This shows that the reactionary ruling class used Wu Xun, and individual people who ate "Wu Xun's rice" also used Wu Xun, so Wu Xun's name was greatly promoted.

This person's encouragement was indeed effective, making me work even harder on this propaganda. I calculated that 1939 was the 100th anniversary of Wu Xun's birth, and I could take this opportunity to launch a nationwide movement, making the "Wu Xun spirit" more deeply rooted in the people of Shandong. So I proposed to the provincial government to change Tangyi County to Wu Xun County, and also initiated fundraising across the country to build ancestral halls and repair tombs for Wu Xun, and proposed to hold a national education conference in Shandong that year, and at the same time hold the Wu Xun ancestral hall completion ceremony. After the "July 7th" Incident, when Jinan was occupied, the Wu Xun ancestral hall was only half built and stopped. Only in that year did I get the official commendation order from the pseudo-National Government.

The methods of promoting the "Wu Xun spirit" differ from one era to another. In the Qing Dynasty and the Beiyang Warlord period, the methods of promotion were naive, simple, and feudal. During the Kuomintang period, that is, during my time in Shandong, the promotion of the "Wu Xun spirit" adopted the propaganda methods of the Western bourgeoisie: using schools, textbooks, newspapers, magazines, public education, and other cultural institutions as tools. Taking schools and textbooks as an example, at that time in Shandong, three thousand and several hundred primary and secondary schools and more than one million and forty thousand students could be educated on the "Wu Xun spirit" in a short period of time. In this way, a dead Wu Xun was turned into many living Wu Xuns. Although many propagandists were influenced by our "official" propaganda, they also had their own ideological roots and class consciousness for praising Wu Xun, and they should also be held responsible.

If Wu Xun was the first accomplice of the reactionary forces in Shandong, then I would be considered the second accomplice!

VI.

Wu Xun's motivation for running schools was to envy the luxurious life of feudal landlords and to envy the officials who "ride in sedan chairs carried by eight people." In a word, Wu Xun's motivation was to climb up, and the effect was to consolidate the feudal forces. His influence was further expanded after being utilized by the feudal ruling class. I used to think that Wu Xun was either a madman or a fool, but later I realized Wu Xun's "cleverness." He used "innovative" and "unconventional" methods to climb up. Since he himself could not enter school, study, pass the imperial examination, become a member of the Hanlin Academy, and eventually "ride in a sedan chair carried by eight people," he used things that others could not do or were unwilling to do to seek personal "success." He really got his wish and finally entered the halls of the feudal rulers!

I have been to various counties in northwestern Shandong many times, inquiring everywhere about Wu Xun's life: At that time, Wu Xun's activity area was the counties of Dongchangfu and Linqingzhou, such as Tangyi, Guantao, Liaocheng, Shouzhang, and Qingping. In the later period of Wu Xun, he was a person with money, land, power, and even fame. His behavior had exceeded "running schools." Wu Xun participated in activities in matters of marriage, funerals, celebrations, buying, and selling, and formed a kind of power. He could cope with ease in any occasion, and could speak eloquently to people of any class. He had the courage and face to stop the sedan chair of Vice Minister Yu De and donate two hundred taels of silver, and to stop the sedan chair of the magistrate of Linqingzhou and donate ten taels of silver. This kind of courage was unmatched by others. At that time, I was a little surprised when I heard this, thinking that Wu Xun was capable and promising in social movements. Now that I think about it, he must have been a local hoodlum and a local tyrant. His land and real estate spanned three counties, Tangyi, Guantao, and Linqing, and many places had his tenants, accounts, and agencies. At first, Wu Xun sought help from local gentry, but in the later period, local gentry welcomed Wu Xun and took pride in supporting Wu Xun; therefore, Wu Xun could go everywhere, live everywhere, and eat everywhere; in the name of "running schools," he collected debts, collected rent, and "took care of local public affairs" everywhere. In fact, Wu Xun had already squeezed into the camp of the ruling class and become a rare rich man in one area.

Some people say that Wu Xun's motive for running schools was good, and the feudal rulers should be held responsible for utilizing him; but I think Wu Xun himself should be held responsible. Taking Han Fuju and me as examples, Han Fuju's and my motives for utilizing Wu Xun (subjective wishes) are consistent with Wu Xun's motives for running schools (subjective wishes). They are different paths leading to the same goal, and they coincide without prior consultation. If the motives are the same, then it cannot be said that one side is completely utilized. Since Wu Xun's motive is consistent with Han Fuju's and my motives, the effect that Wu Xun sought is also the same as the effect that Han Fuju and I sought.

VII.

Wu Xun was born in Tangyi County, Luxibei, which is the land of the ancient Zhao Kingdom. From Luxi to Hejian and Daming in Hebei Province, it is a place where heroes and heroines have been produced throughout history, from Huang Chao, Song Jiang, Wu Song, Wang Lun, to Dou Erdun and the characters in "Suanzaolin" in modern novels, they all came from this place. There, "everyone practices boxing, everyone practices martial arts," and the spirit of resistance and struggle of "drawing a knife to help when you see injustice on the road" is very strong. Local heroes competed to be able to "rob the imperial caravan" (that is, rob the emperor's silver) as an honor. In the era that Wu Xun experienced, the people of Luxi had armed uprisings several times, and the activities of resisting the "government" had never stopped. Therefore, they were "tough and difficult to govern," and the rulers of all dynasties were at a loss. Although they killed many people, they could not kill them all. Suddenly, a rare capitulationist Wu Xun emerged among the poor people here, and the feudal ruling class thought it was a rare commodity, so they specially utilized it, wanting to take this opportunity to "transform customs and habits" and soften the people's spirit of struggle, so they made Wu Xun an example and wantonly promoted him. Without the utilization and promotion of the ruling class, Wu Xun's name would not be known by so many people. Today, the reactionary ruling class has been overthrown, and most of those who used Wu Xun to serve the reactionary ruling class have also died of old age. Only my age is relatively young, and I am still alive. Therefore, I confess and reveal the inside story of deceiving the people, fooling the education sector, and intellectuals in those years, so that everyone can understand the truth.

### 批判我利用武训为反动  统治阶级服务的反动行为

　　批判我利用武训为反动
    统治阶级服务的反动行为
    何思源
    一
    我在年青的时候，是一个穷学生。得到了他人经济上的帮助，才升入大学。以后又考上公费留学，一帆风顺地向上爬，一直爬进了反动统治阶级的阵营里。一九二八年做了山东省伪教育厅长，在山东一口气干了十九年（十七年厅长，二年省主席）。
    在山东本来早知道武训其人，但未引起我的重视。后来有人给我一本有关武训事迹的书看，我略略阅读了一遍，始知有机可乘，对于武训之为人，虽仍不知底细，但已体会到武训是可以利用的了。
    于是我以视察为名，出发到了堂邑县柳林镇，首先看武训小学（即原来的“崇贤义学”），再拜扫武训坟墓，又接见武训的外甥（或者是侄子），加以慰问鼓励。以后又到馆陶县看武训创立的第二个小学（即原来的“馆陶杨二庄义学”）。最后到了临清县御史巷看规模最大的武训小学（即原来的“临清御史巷义学”）。我找出了这些学校历来的捐款名册查看，捐款册子是很厚很古老的一大本，内中除了年代较久的捐款人姓名是抄写的外，近代捐款人多是亲笔签名。现在我虽然忘记了捐款数目，但当时确曾惊讶其数字之大！捐款人的姓名我记不清，却记得有巡抚、侍郎、督军、省长、富绅、名宦、学者、名流等，总之，不是官僚、军阀，就是封建地主。看完了全册，我即刻提笔签名捐了五百元，又慷慨答应将武训小学改为武训中学，由省政府大量津贴帮助；并提出要尽力提倡“武训精神”，印发《武训传》及画像。
    二
    我得到这些初步印象后，在回济南的路上，总是盘算着武训是怎么样的一个人。当时我的思想情况大概如下：一、武训的办学与我气味相投，即是帮助我们训练人材，所以值得推崇表扬。二、当时在山东的政治舞台上，办教育的人处处被歧视，省教育厅，县教育科等皆被视为无关轻重的机关，从事教育工作的人皆被视为无足轻重的人。宣扬武训可以抬高教育界的身价，并可安慰和鼓励同仁。三、以宣扬“武训精神”为名，可向省政府多要教育经费，以扩大我个人的教育成绩。四、借“武训精神”可以鼓励学生用功读书，使他们安份守己，不闹风潮。五、借“武训精神”可以督促教育工作人员努力工作，不斤斤计较待遇与钟点，使学校安定，我的工作可以顺利。六、借宣扬“武训精神”的运动，可以抬高自己身价，巩固自己地位。
    回忆我在儿童时代，就常常听到祖母说：“斗大黄金印，天高白玉堂，不读万卷书，怎能伴君王？”又说：“万般皆下品，惟有读书高。”当时我就有“坐八抬轿”的幻想，羡慕统治阶级的豪华富贵。但以为自家很穷，那有实现的可能，现在居然如愿以偿，由于个人的刻苦努力而做了“大官”，这岂不是“武训精神”的具体实现吗？我觉得“武训精神”与我祖母所教导的精神是一致的。这也是我努力发扬“武训精神”的原因之一。
    三
    我对蒋介石及其反动政府的报告比较简单。但是对韩复矩（当时的山东省伪主席——土皇帝）却说得很详细。我说：“武训之为人，温顺驯良，谦恭有礼。武训办的是三纲五常的教育，天地君亲师的教育，尊师尊孔重道的教育。发扬‘武训精神’对于我们是有帮助的。”韩复渠比我更聪明了，更懂得多。他说：“鲁西一带民性强悍，‘土匪’如毛，历代都没有肃清。若是穷人个个都像武训，治鲁西就不难了。”当时韩复矩正在专心“剿匪”，对于鲁西“土匪”最感棘手，于是决意用奴颜婢膝的投降主义的武训来转移鲁西风俗，以“知礼、不犯上、不作乱”的“武训精神”来改正地方人民的“剽悍之气”，使其“纳于正轨”。他的用意是利用“武训精神”来减少“土匪”来源。在韩复矩的思想中，以为“穷人”若都能像武训似的见了封建统治阶级就屈膝磕头，不反抗，不斗争，遵照武训所走的道路，以读书上进为目的，“则山东的天下稳如泰山矣”。韩复矩这种思想是确切地代表了反动统治阶级的思想的。无怪武训学校的捐款册中，几乎全是官僚、地主、士绅、名流的名字啊！韩复矩同我的发扬“武训精神”运动是有深远的、阴险的用心的。
    四
    从此以后，我更体会到其中的玄妙。有一次，有人告诉我：一九三四年冬某月某日，是武训诞生纪念日。我知道宣传机会来了，可以抓紧时机，大干一下。我先将《武训传》及画像翻印出来，分发全省各地、各学校，通令全省学校，以武训生平事迹作中学教材，以武训故事列入小学课本。又令全省各民众教育机关加紧“武训精神”的宣传。预备于一九三四年在临清县替武训开一个扩大纪念大会。我又在河北房山县购到一大块汉白玉，请人为武训造像。一面用省政府名义电蒋介石、伪教育部及全国各“要人”，征求匾额赞词及其他表扬物品。并通知鲁西北二十余县的学校、教育机关，县、区、乡、镇主管及地方士绅、名流届时参加。我记得蒋介石送来的匾额是“为人师表”。开会前两日，我就带着蒋介石的匾额和汉白玉雕成的武训像，率领省会的许多学校校长、教育机关首长先到了临清。如果我记得不错的话，当时到会的还有董渭川、李士钊、张元亨、张默生、韩多峰、沙明远等人。
    当时我这样大肆宣传，一半是真，一半是假；心中一面钦佩“武训的为人”，一面却怀疑武训是个疯子或是个精神病者。但难得这种膝盖软的人给了我们（反动统治阶级）不少的帮助，特别对于我个人帮忙更大，我们应当“谢谢这位先生！”
    五
    一九三五年，在济南有位李某来告诉我说：“外面有人传说你是武训转世，不知确否？你可计算计算生日。”我本不信什么转世托生之说，但我觉得这种传言对我有利，于是我屈指计算武训死于一八九六年，我生于一八九六年，便说：“很对”。可是不敢再详细算下去，恐月日时辰如果错了，反为不妙。这说明反动统治阶级利用武训，个别吃“武训饭”的人也利用武训，于是武训之名大扬。
    这个人给我打气果然有效，使我更加倍努力于这一宣传。我计算到一九三九年是武训生日一百周年，乘此机会可以作一个全国性的运动，在山东可使“武训精神”更深入民间。于是我在省政府提议改堂邑县为武训县，又发起在全国各地募捐，为武训建祠、修墓，并提议于是年在山东开全国性的教育会议，同时举行武训祠落成典礼。到“七七”事变后济南沦陷时，武训祠仅造成一半就停工了。仅于是年得到伪国民政府之正式褒扬令。
    宣扬“武训精神”的方法，一时代与一时代不同。在清朝及北洋军阀时期，是幼稚的、简单封建式的宣扬方法。在国民党时期，即是我在山东的时期，宣扬“武训精神”是采用西洋资产阶级的宣传方法：利用学校、课本、报章、杂志、社会民教及其他文化机构作工具。以学校及课本论，当时在山东可以同时使三万数千个中小学及一百四十余万学生于短期内受到“武训精神”的教育。如此就把一个死武训变成了许多活武训。虽然许多宣传者受了我们“官式”宣传的影响；但他们之所以歌颂武训也是有他们的思想根源与阶级意识的，他们自己也应当负责。
    如果说武训在山东是反动势力的第一个帮凶，我也算是帮凶第二了吧！
    六
    武训兴学的动机是羡慕封建地主的奢侈生活，羡慕“坐八抬大轿”的官僚。一句话，武训的动机是向上爬，效果是巩固了封建势力。他的影响经过封建统治阶级加以利用后，就更扩大起来了。以前我以为武训不是个疯子，便是个傻子，后来我领会到武训的“聪明”，他以“标新立异”“出奇制胜”的方法向上爬；他本人既然不能入学读书？中举人，点翰林，以至“坐八抬大轿”，就用他人所不能作，所不屑作的事来求取个人的“成功”。他果然如愿以偿，最后走进了封建统治者的庙堂！
    我到过鲁西北各县多次，各处探询武训生前的状况：当时武训活动的范围是东昌府与临清州之各县，如堂邑、馆陶、聊城、寿张、清平等县。到了后期的武训，是有钱，有地，有势，甚至有名的人了。他的行为已超过“兴学”，凡婚、丧、喜、庆、作买、作卖的事，武训皆参加活动，并形成了一种势力。他在任何场合，都能应付裕如，见了任何阶层的人，都能出口成词。他有魄力，有面皮，能拦着侍郎裕德的轿捐了二百两银子，拦着临清州知州的轿捐了拾两银子。这样胆量为他人所不及。当时我听见此说，有点惊奇，以为武训在社会运动中能干有为。现在想起来，他一定是当时的地痞流氓，一方之霸。他的土地、房产跨堂邑、馆陶及临清三县，不少的地方有他的佃农、账户及机关。初时，武训求地方士绅帮助，后期则地方士绅奉迎武训，以赞助武训为荣幸；所以武训处处可去，处处有家住，处处有饭吃；以“兴学”为名，各处讨账、收租及“照料地方公事”。事实上，武训早已挤入统治阶级的营垒，而成为一方罕有的大财主了。
    有人说武训兴学的动机是好的，封建统治者利用他，应由统治者负责任；我则以为武训自己应负责任。以韩复矩和我为例，韩复矩和我利用武训的动机（主观愿望）与武训兴学的动机（主观愿望）是一致的，异道同归，不谋而合的。动机相同，则不能说那一方面完全被利用。既然武训的动机和韩复矩与我的动机一致，武训所企求的效果和韩复矩与我所企求的效果也是一样的。
    七
    武训生于鲁西北之堂邑县，是古赵国之地。自鲁西以至河北省的河间、大名，是历史产生英雄豪杰的地方，自黄巢、宋江、武松、王伦，以至近代小说中的窦尔敦，及“酸枣林”中人物等，皆出此地。那里“人人打拳，个个习武”，“路见不平，拔刀相助”的反抗斗争精神很盛；当地豪杰争以能“劫皇杠”（即抢皇帝的银子）为荣耀。在武训所经历的时代，鲁西北人民就武装暴动过好几次，反抗“政府”的活动就没有停止过，因此“强悍难治”，历代统治者都束手无策，虽杀了不少人民，但杀不胜杀。这里穷人中忽然出来一个例外的投降主义的武训，封建统治阶级以为奇货可居，故特别利用一番，想借此“移风易俗”，软化人民的斗争精神，才把武训作个样子，恣意宣扬起来。如无统治阶级的利用和宣扬，武训的名字是不会为这么多人所知的。今天反动统治阶级已被推翻，那些利用武训为反动统治阶级服务的人也多已老死，只有我的年龄较轻，尚留人间，所以我坦白出来，把当年蒙蔽人民、愚弄教育界及知识分子的内幕揭开，让大家明了真相。
