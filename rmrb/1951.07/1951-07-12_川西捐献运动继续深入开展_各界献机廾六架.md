Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th. The production increase and donation movement in the Western Sichuan Administrative Region is continuing to deepen. As of the 7th of this month, people from all walks of life in the region have decided to donate twenty-six fighter planes, four anti-aircraft guns, and six artillery pieces. Industrialists, business people, and handicraft workers in various places are actively improving production techniques and management methods to increase income for donations. Ma Shuquan, a representative of more than 2,800 papermaking households in Jiajiang County, a well-known handicraft papermaking area in southwestern China, guaranteed at the Jiajiang County People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Representative Conference that he would standardize specifications, make good paper, continue to expand sales, and donate 100,000 yuan for every 10,000 sheets sold (according to the county's expected paper production of about 3,000 tons this year). The industrial and commercial sectors of Huaikou Town in Jintang County, a sugar-producing area, also decided to improve the quality of sugar, improve management methods, increase production and donations, and it is estimated that the entire town will donate at least 100 million yuan. Many factory workers throughout the region have actively joined the donation upsurge of "Anti-American and Aid-Korea Voluntary Labor Day."

　　Many counties have held a series of meetings from village to household, and have generally established production increase and donation plans for families and individuals. Li Fuquan, a farmer from Liangshui Village in Wenjiang County, used his painful experience of being captured by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to repair airports before liberation to inspire his family's patriotic enthusiasm and participate in the donation movement. Huang Chuanxiu, a famous female hero in suppressing bandits, originally only decided to donate one dan of yellow rice, but after holding a family meeting, she re-established a production increase and donation plan, and jointly agreed to donate two dan of yellow rice. Yang Guiying, a farmer from Xinxing Township in Guanghan County, made a long-term production increase and donation plan for herself, spinning eight liang of thread every day and donating five liang of thread per month; raising one more hen and donating one egg every two days. Guan Zilun, a 74-year-old farmer from Liangshui Village in Wenjiang, said: I am not that old, I want to collect more manure and do a good job of farming, and increase production and donate 20 jin of rice. In order to thoroughly implement the production increase and donation plan, many counties have also generally established inspection committees at the township level and inspection teams at the village level to conduct regular inspections. Some villages also stipulate that a meeting will be held after the autumn harvest or at the end of the year to summarize the achievements of production increase and donation.

　　川西捐献运动继续深入开展
    各界献机廾六架
    【新华社成都十一日电】川西行政区增产捐献运动正继续深入开展中。截至本月七日止，该区各界人民已决定捐献战斗机二十六架、高射炮四门、大炮六门。各地工商业者与手工业者纷纷改进生产技术与经营方法，力求增加收入作为捐献。西南有名的手工造纸区夹江县二千八百多家造纸户的代表马述全，在该县各界人民抗美援朝代表会上，保证要划一规格，把纸造好，继续扩大销路，每卖一万张捐献十万元（按该县今年可产纸约三千吨）。产糖区金堂县淮口镇工商界亦决定提高糖的品质，改善经营方法，增产捐献，预计全镇至少可捐献一亿元。全区各地许多工厂职工已纷纷投入“抗美援朝义务劳动日”的捐献热潮中。
    许多县份，从村到户召开了一系列的会议，普遍订立了家庭与个人的增产捐献计划。温江县凉水村农民李福全用自己在解放前被美蒋匪帮抓去修飞机场所受迫害的惨痛经验，启发了全家的爱国热情，参加捐献运动。著名剿匪女英雄黄传秀原只决定捐一石黄谷，后召开家庭会议，重新订立增产捐献计划，共同商定捐献两石黄谷。广汉县新兴乡农妇杨桂英订出个人长期增产捐献计划，每天纺线八两，每月捐献五两线子；多喂一只母鸡，两天捐一个鸡蛋。温江凉水村七十四岁的老农民官子伦说：我并不算老，我要多检粪做好庄稼，增产捐献大米二十斤。为了彻底实现增产捐献计划，不少县份并普遍成立了以乡为单位的检查委员会和以村为单位的检查小组，实行定期检查。有的村子还规定在秋收后或年终举行一次会议，总结增产捐献的成绩。
