　　National University Graduates Excitedly Await Unified Job Assignment
    [Our Newspaper] This year, university graduates across the country are concluding their studies, eagerly and happily anticipating unified job assignments to participate in the nation's construction. The vast majority of graduates from various universities, upon hearing the government's decision to uniformly allocate jobs to university graduates nationwide, expressed their resolute obedience to the state's unified job assignment. Northern Jiaotong University, Shandong Agricultural College, Henan University, Anhui University, and other schools' entire graduating classes successively submitted challenge letters and response letters, indicating their unconditional obedience to the unified job assignment. They stated that they would go wherever needed, not be picky about jobs, not selective about regions, not emphasize personal benefits, and not stress personal interests. They also pledged to obey leadership, adhere to discipline, actively work, diligently learn, and unite with the masses after assuming their positions. Graduates from over ten universities, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Shanxi University, Tongji University, and Xiamen University, also issued challenge letters to each other within their schools or wrote letters to Chairman Mao, the Ministry of Education, school authorities, and student unions, expressing their determination to obey the assignments. Six students, including Zhong Jiquan from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Specialization Course at Beijing Agricultural University, wrote to the Central Ministry of Education, saying, "We resolutely and unconditionally obey the unified assignment and hope to go to remote and most needed areas for animal husbandry and veterinary personnel, such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Qinghai, in the border regions of our motherland." Over fifty students from the Civil Engineering and Metallurgy Departments of Tianjin Beiyang University, including Yu Ruhuan and Ma Kuiduo, jointly wrote to the Central Ministry of Education, requesting the organization of a volunteer aid-Korea engineering team to work on the front lines in Korea, dedicating their efforts to strike the aggressors, aid Korea, and defend the motherland. There was also a very small number of graduates who initially did not fully understand the government's policy of unified job assignment; they had considered finding jobs themselves and being selective about positions. However, after strengthening their patriotic education, the vast majority of these graduates also understood the relationship between the individual and the country, willingly abandoning personal interests to obey the government's assignment. Forty-nine graduates from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tongji University, after criticizing their incorrect thinking in a forum, expressed their willingness to obey the government's job assignments and added a clause to their patriotic pledge: "Guarantee obedience to the government's assignment, go to the assigned job position, and not create emotional disturbances." A graduating student from the Foreign Languages Department of Fu Jen Catholic University, after studying and undergoing ideological struggle, returned the job offer that her lover had arranged for her. A student from the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, whose father was the director of an electrical factory, wanted him to return to his factory after graduation. However, after his ideological transformation, he refused his father and decided to obey the state's assignment.
    The Central People's Government's Ministry of Education and Ministry of Personnel, in order to enhance university graduates' correct understanding of the government's unified job assignment, held a summer study group in the North China region in Beijing and instructed the education and personnel departments of major administrative regions to similarly hold such groups within their regions, inviting responsible comrades from various government departments to report on the construction situation in various aspects of the motherland. Through such studies, students will further realize that all job positions in our great motherland are lovable, that countless heroes and role models are emerging in various jobs every day, and that these heroes and role models are all forged from ordinary and specific tasks.

　　全国各高等学校暑期毕业生
    兴奋愉快等待统一分配工作
    【本报讯】今年暑期全国高等学校毕业生正在结束学校的学习生活，以兴奋愉快的心情等待统一分配工作，参加祖国的建设事业。各校绝大多数毕业生，听到政府决定对全国高等学校毕业生统一分配工作以后，纷纷表示坚决服从国家统一分配工作。北方交通大学、山东农学院、河南大学、安徽大学等校全体毕业生先后提出挑战书、应战书，表示无条件服从统一分配工作，什么地方需要就到什么地方去，不拣工作，不择地区，不讲待遇，不强调个人兴趣，并提出到工作岗位后，保证服从领导，遵守纪律，积极工作，努力学习，团结群众。清华大学、北京大学、山西大学、同济大学、厦门大学等十余校毕业生也在校内互相提出挑战书，或给毛主席、教育部、学校当局及学生会写信，表示他们愿意服从分配的决心。北京农业大学畜牧兽医专修科仲跻全等六位同学给中央教育部写信说：“我们坚决无条件地服从统一分配，希望到较艰苦而最需要畜牧兽医人员的地方如新疆、内蒙古、青海等祖国的边疆去。”天津北洋大学土木系和冶金系四年级于汝寰、马魁铎等五十余位同学，先后联名给中央教育部写信，要求组织志愿援朝工程队，到朝鲜前线去工作，献出自己的力量，打击侵略者，援助朝鲜，保卫祖国。也有极少一部分毕业生起先对政府统一分配工作的方针不够了解，他们曾想自找工作，挑拣职位。但这些毕业生在加强爱国主义的学习以后，绝大多数也了解了个人与国家的关系，情愿放弃个人利益，服从政府分配。同济大学机械系四十九位毕业生在座谈会上批判了自己不正确的思想后，表示愿意服从政府分配工作，并在爱国公约中加上了一条：“保证服从政府分配，到工作岗位上去，不闹情绪。”辅仁大学外文系一位毕业同学，在学习后，经过思想斗争，把爱人给自己接洽好的工作聘书退回去了。清华电机系一位同学，父亲是一个电机厂厂长，让他毕业后回自己工厂去工作。但当他思想转变了之后，拒绝了父亲，决定服从国家的分配。
    中央人民政府教育部、人事部为提高高等学校毕业生对政府统一分配工作的正确认识，在北京举办了华北区暑期学习团，并指示各大行政区教育、人事部门在本区内同样举办，请政府各部门负责同志报告关于祖国各方面的建设情况。通过这样的学习，同学们将会更进一步体会到我们伟大祖国的各种工作岗位都是可爱的，每天在各种工作中都在涌现着无数的英雄、模范，而这些英雄、模范都是从一件件平凡而具体的工作中锻炼出来的。
