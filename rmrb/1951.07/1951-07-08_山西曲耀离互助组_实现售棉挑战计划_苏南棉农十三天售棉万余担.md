The national cotton production model, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team in Jie County, Shanxi Province, has completely fulfilled its patriotic cotton sales challenge plan issued to cotton farmers across the country.

After the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team issued its challenge to the country, with the help of the local People's Government and Communist Party cadres, by June 15th, they had motivated all the farmers in the village to sell all their stored cotton to the state. All the cotton was of good quality, dry, clean, and free of any adulteration or water.

During this cotton sales and storage campaign, the members of the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team, along with Communist Party members and cadres in the village, took the lead themselves and mobilized the village's reading group, blackboard newspaper, broadcasting horn, and people's school to conduct patriotic cotton sales propaganda for the cotton farmers, explaining the benefits of selling cotton. Shangguan Baozhi was not in a hurry to use the money and was reluctant to sell his stored cotton. After Qu Yaoli and the members of the mutual aid team patiently enlightened and educated him, he said with emotion: "Now the cotton is selling well, precisely because our government has built factories. In the past, we grew cotton, and we lost money every year." He sold all 280 jin of his stored lint cotton to the state. Some farmers also felt that they did not have much stored cotton, and selling it to the state would not make much of a difference. After hearing the propaganda, they also understood that accumulating small amounts can make a big difference, and put forward the slogan "Sell one jin if you have one jin," which plunged the village's cotton farmers into a heated cotton sales competition.

The women of Qu Zhuangtou Village have traditionally engaged in spinning and weaving, and the cotton stored by women also belonged to them. If they sold it, the money would go to the family, and the women would suffer. Qu Yaoli set an example by first holding a family meeting and guaranteeing to his family that women would sell their own cotton and get their own money; that money from women's cotton sales could be deposited in the bank by the family if they wished, or the family could buy fine cloth if they wished. Those who did not want to sell their cotton could temporarily lend it to the family to sell, and return it in full in the autumn. After the women in Qu Yaoli's family sold their stored cotton, Qu Yaoli bought fine cloth for all the women in his family. Li Shuzhen, the chairman of the village women's federation, also specially convened a meeting of all the female cadres in the village to introduce them to the experience of Qu Yaoli's family meeting, and then the female cadres divided up the work and went to each household to help convene family meetings. This method played a significant role in promoting the patriotic cotton sales campaign in the village.

Xinhua News Agency: Cotton farmers in the cotton-producing areas of southern Jiangsu are enthusiastically selling or storing stored cotton. From June 1st to 13th, cotton farmers in Nanhui, Chuansha, Shanghai, Fengxian, Songjiang and other counties sold more than 11,000 dan of lint cotton to the state and deposited more than 500 million yuan of cotton money into the People's Bank. In Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan and other counties, farmers had already sold more than 14,000 dan of lint cotton in April and May and deposited more than 1.3 billion yuan of cotton money into banks.

This time, because the cotton farmers received patriotic ideological education, they sold and stored cotton even more enthusiastically. Cotton farmers in Tanzhi Township, Nanhui County, beat gongs and drums and collectively sold their stored cotton to cooperatives. Ding Wenxi, a member of the Communist Youth League in Linpu Township, Shanghai County, not only sold more than 500 jin of cotton himself, but also mobilized others to sell more than 150 dan. Qian Wangshi, a widow in her sixties from Zhouli Village, Lugong Township, Jiading County, heard that selling cotton was also an act of patriotism and sold all the cotton she had stored for two or three years to the state.

### 山西曲耀离互助组  实现售棉挑战计划  苏南棉农十三天售棉万余担

　　山西曲耀离互助组
    实现售棉挑战计划
    苏南棉农十三天售棉万余担
    全国棉花丰产模范山西省解县曲耀离互助组已经全部实现他们向全国棉农发出的爱国售棉挑战计划。
    曲耀离互助组向全国挑战后，在当地人民政府和共产党干部的帮助下，至六月十五日，已带动全村农民将全部存棉售给国家。全部棉花质量干，白净，没有掺杂使水的情形。
    曲耀离互助组组员及全村共产党员和干部在这次售棉、储棉运动中，自己带头，并动员全村读报组、黑板报、广播筒及民校等，对棉农进行了爱国售棉的宣传，讲解售棉的好处。上官宝治不急于用钱，存棉不愿出售，经曲耀离和互助组组员耐心地启发教育后，他感动地说：“现在棉花销路好，正是因为咱们政府办好了工厂，从前咱种棉花，那一年不赔钱。”他将所存皮棉二百八十斤全部卖给了国家。还有一些农民，认为存棉无几，卖给国家也不顶大事。听到宣传后，也懂得集少可以成多，提出“有一斤卖一斤”的口号，使全村棉农卷入了售棉竞赛的热潮。
    曲庄头村的妇女向来有纺织习惯，妇女存棉也归自己所有，如果出卖后归了家庭，妇女就要吃亏。曲耀离以身作则，首先开了家庭会议，向全家保证：妇女自己卖棉，自己得钱；妇女售棉所得，愿存到银行的可以由家庭代存，愿买细布的可以由家庭代买，不愿卖棉的，可暂借给家庭出售，秋后如数归还。曲耀离家的妇女们将存棉售出后，曲耀离就给全家妇女买回了细布。村妇联会主席李淑珍也特地召集全村女干部开会，向她们介绍曲耀离家庭会议的经验，然后女干部们又分工到各户帮助召开家庭会议。这个工作方法对于该村农民爱国售棉运动的开展起了很大的作用。

    苏南产棉地区的棉农踊跃出售或储存存棉。六月一日到十三日，南汇、川沙、上海、奉贤、松江等县棉农，向国家售出皮棉一万一千多担，并将五亿多元棉款存入人民银行。嘉定、太仓、宝山等县农民在四、五两月中，就已售出皮棉一万四千多担，存入银行的棉款达十三亿多元。
    这次因为对棉农进行了爱国主义的思想教育，棉农售棉、储棉更为踊跃。南汇县坦直乡棉农敲锣打鼓，集体地把存棉卖给合作社。上海县临浦乡青年团员丁文希不但自己卖出五百多斤棉花，还动员别人卖出一百五十多担。嘉定县陆公乡周里村六十多岁的寡妇钱王氏，听说售棉也是爱国行动，把存了二、三年的棉花也全部售给国家。
