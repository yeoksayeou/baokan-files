　　Leading Cadres in the Central South Region and Pingyuan Province and Other Places
    Value This Newspaper's Editorial on Land Survey and Production Determination
Editor:
    After the People's Daily published the "Outline for Land Survey and Production Determination" and related editorials, we have received the following responses:
    (1) After seeing the editorial, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central South Bureau instructed the Yangtze Daily to strengthen publicity on land survey and production determination in order to promote this work. Comrades from the Policy Research Office of the Central South Bureau also specifically consulted with the Central South Finance Department to study how to promote land survey and production determination. They said, "Doing this will not greatly affect the central work and can also meet the demands of farmers. It should be done well." The Central South Finance Department made a special long-distance phone call to express that this editorial had begun to change the thinking of leading comrades in the Central South Region and was of great benefit to the work. They hoped that more such editorials would be published in the future, along with specific work experience.
    (2) Two days after the editorial was published, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government telegraphed each special district to study the editorial in depth and to formulate implementation plans accordingly, which should be reported to the Provincial People's Government before July 25.
    (3) Local newspapers, such as the Yangtze Daily, Northeast Daily, Mass Daily, Southern Daily, New Hunan Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Dazhong Daily, and Southern Anhui Daily, have all reprinted this editorial.

　　中南区及平原省等地领导干部
    重视本报关于查田定产的社论编辑同志：
    人民日报发表“查田定产”纲要及有关社论后，我们已得到如下的反应：
    （一）中共中央中南局宣传部看到社论后，即指示长江日报社，加强对查田定产的宣传，以推动这一工作。中南局政策研究室同志并专找中南财政部研究如何推行查田定产问题。他们说：“这样做，不大影响中心工作，又能满足农民要求，应当好好搞一下。”中南财政部为此专来一次长途电话，表示这篇社论使中南区领导同志思想上开始转变，对工作益处甚大，希望今后多多发表这样的社论，并介绍具体的工作经验。
    （二）平原省人民政府于社论发表后二日，电令各专署对社论深加研究，并据以拟定实施方案，于七月二十五日前报告省人民政府。
    （三）各地方报纸，如长江日报、东北日报、群众日报、南方日报、新湖南报、浙江日报、大众日报、皖南日报等均已转载这一社论。
        中央财政部  李成瑞
