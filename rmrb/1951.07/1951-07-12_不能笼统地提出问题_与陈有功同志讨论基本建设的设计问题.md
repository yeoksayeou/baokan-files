Do Not Raise Problems in General Terms
     ——A Discussion on Basic Construction Design with Comrade Chen Yougong
    Chen Qing
    Comrade Chen Yougong objects to the People's Daily's continuous criticism of the phenomenon of blindly starting construction without proper design in basic construction. He believes these criticisms are "scholars sitting in glass windows," making comments "without knowing how difficult things are." After his opinion (see People's Daily, July 10) was published, I have heard many opinions for and against it, indicating that the issues he raised need to be clarified in understanding so that in future basic construction projects, the mistake of "blindly starting construction without proper design" will not be committed, or will be committed less often.
    The reason why Comrade Chen Yougong's opinion can gain the support of some comrades, or represent the opinions of some enterprise leaders, is that he raises a variety of problems in basic construction and even in enterprise management in general terms. There are indeed many difficulties in these areas, which are of constant concern to enterprise leaders but have not been quickly resolved. However, these problems are not all the causes of "blindly starting construction without proper design." Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the issues raised in Comrade Chen Yougong's letter so that the argument is clear and appropriate conclusions can be drawn.
    First, he believes that the People's Daily's criticism "obliterates the achievements" of basic construction. This statement does not reflect a spirit of seeking truth from facts, and as a result, it easily arouses a blind opposition to criticism. Usually, people who are unwilling to accept criticism like to use the rhetorical question, "Am I all wrong?" to actually reject criticism. This is not calm and humble enough. The People's Daily's editorial on June 16 pointed out at the beginning that "some basic construction investments started construction without going through design..." And its conclusion called on "as long as we are willing to work hard and learn, we can accumulate experience and create greater achievements for the construction of the new China." Therefore, whether the achievements are "obliterated" is not worth arguing. The reason for pointing this out is to prevent an attitude of arguing for the sake of arguing.
    Mainly, let us analyze whether the "extremely many objective difficulties" raised by Comrade Chen Yougong are the reasons for the occurrence of blindly starting construction without proper design. The so-called "organizations of various enterprises have just been established, some democratic management is only a formality, wages have not been fully adjusted, asset inventory is only preliminary, and cost accounting has just been learned," etc., these obviously belong to the problems in the production management of existing enterprises and do not involve the design of basic construction. It is irrelevant to newly built enterprises, and even for basic construction in existing enterprises, it is only a common general problem. Since most of the basic construction in the past could be carried out well under this common situation, it cannot be the main reason for the occurrence of errors. What should be especially pointed out is that any enterprise that can carry out basic construction must be more standardized in management and production. If this is not the case and basic construction is rashly carried out, then there is a deviation in the guiding principle in the first place.
    The two points that Comrade Chen Yougong particularly emphasized are "the budget is submitted, but it takes a long time to be approved" and "serious tasks are weighing on our heads, whether or not to carry out basic construction." These two points are extremely important situations in the current basic construction and deserve detailed discussion.
    Regarding the slow approval of budgets, we also have this feeling. What is the reason? On the one hand, the higher authorities need to consider the overall and long-term construction issues; on the other hand, it is precisely because the budget itself is unsound. For example: seeking big and fast results regardless of conditions and asking for more money, starting construction without conditions for design, etc. Such budgets are difficult for the higher authorities to approve quickly, and even cannot be approved accurately. This is an important experience in making basic construction requests. Moreover, the content of the budget is a detailed plan for needing money, including detailed plans for investigation, design, construction plan, appropriation request, ordering, and personnel training. How can it be said that the delayed approval of the budget will hinder the design?
    Regarding the issue of "urgent tasks": the state has not asked us to only seek speed, regardless of how many technical cadres there are, and blindly carry out basic construction. On the contrary, it has repeatedly instructed us to carry out detailed designs based on resources, financial resources, human resources, and other conditions, to do things well first, and not to be greedy for more. So, is there a phenomenon of urgent tasks? Yes, but the main reason is that some of our comrades are too anxious, enthusiastic about industrial construction, and do not pay much attention to conditions, starting rashly, and making the work passive; that is, the "subjective" is all wanting to do well, but they have taken a detour, and haste makes waste. This is also our major lesson, not an objective reason for defending inadequate design.
    Although Comrade Chen Yougong listed many objective difficulties, he himself failed to connect them with the theme of "blindly starting construction without proper design." In the last paragraph of his opinion, he can only say "inadequate design, isn't it because of the lack of technical personnel?" The lack of experience and cadres is a well-known situation. Precisely because of this, the Common Program stipulated that our industrial construction policy is to carry out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The government's various instructions and decisions have always been implementing this general policy. However, the situation of some agencies in implementing this policy shows that the spirit of taking care of the overall situation is not yet clear, but rather starting from the local situation and needs, hoping to take shortcuts (unwilling to seriously design), and the result is counterproductive. Therefore, reviewing the mistakes we have already made should start from the guiding ideology of basic construction and from the attitude towards design. "Objective reasons" can only limit the quantitative development, but should not limit our requirements for quality. What is especially important is the attitude of striving to overcome objective difficulties and striving for progress.
    There are indeed many difficulties in the basic construction of enterprises, such as material supply, transportation, contracting, appropriation, etc. These are mainly problems in the construction process. The shortcomings in the work of various levels are one aspect of causing difficulties in the work, and efforts should be made to overcome them. However, for the mistakes that have already occurred, a serious attitude must be taken and a review must be carried out. Simply emphasizing objective difficulties can only hinder one's own progress. The "Provisional Measures for Basic Construction Work Procedures" issued by the Central Financial and Economic Commission and the State Council's decisions and instructions on this issue still need to be studied well by our enterprise workers in order to improve work.

　　不能笼统地提出问题
     ——与陈有功同志讨论基本建设的设计问题
    陈青
    陈有功同志反对人民日报对于基本建设中没有正确设计即行盲目施工的现象的连续批评。他认为这些批评是“学者坐在玻璃窗内”，“不知事情难办”的议论。他的意见（见七月十日人民日报）发表后，我已听到不少赞成的和反对的意见，说明他所提出的问题需要从认识上澄清，才能使今后的基本建设工程中不犯或少犯“没有正确设计即行盲目施工”的错误。
    陈有功同志的意见之所以能够取得某些同志的拥护，或者说是代表着一部分企业领导干部的意见，是由于他笼统地提出了基本建设中以至企业管理中的多方面的问题，在这些方面确有不少困难，而为企业的领导同志所时刻关心尚未能迅速解决的。但这些问题并不都是造成“没有正确设计即行盲目施工”的原因，因之，有必要分析陈有功同志来信中所提出的问题，使论点明确，才能得出恰当的结论。
    首先他认为人民日报的批评，是把基本建设的成绩“一笔抹杀了”。这种提法不是实事求是的精神，其结果，容易引起盲目的反对批评的情绪。通常不愿接受批评的人，好以“难道我都错了吗？”的反问态度，实际上拒绝批评，这是不够冷静和虚心的表现。人民日报六月十六日的社论在开始即指出，是“有些基本建设的投资，没有经过设计……就动了工。”而其结语则号召“只要我们自己肯努力、肯学习，就能积累经验，为新中国的建设创造更大的成绩。”因之，是否把成绩“抹杀了”不必争论。所以需要指出此点者，是为了防止强辩的情绪。
    主要的我们来分析一下陈有功同志所提出的“客观方面的困难的极多的事实”，是否就是发生没有正确设计即行盲目施工的原因；所谓“各企业的组织刚刚建立，有的民主管理还只是形式，工资亦未全面调整，资产清理只是初步，成本核算刚刚学会，”等等，这显然是属于现有各企业的生产管理中的问题，并不涉及基本建设的设计问题。对于新建企业固然无关，即是对于在原有企业中进行基本建设，也只是共同的一般性的问题。既然过去多数的基本建设在这种共同情况之下还能进行得好，因之它就不可能是发生错误的主要原因。尤其应当指出的，凡是能够进行基本建设的企业，必然是在管理和生产方面都较正规的。倘若不是这样而冒然进行基本建设，那首先在指导方针上就发生了偏差。
    陈有功同志特别强调的两点是“预算送了上去，好久不批”，和“严重的任务压在头上，基本建设干是不干”。这两点是目前基本建设中极为重要的情况，值得详加讨论。
    关于预算批准迟缓，我们也有此感觉。其原因是什么呢？一方面是上级需要考虑通盘的和长远的建设问题；另一方面，则恰恰是由于预算本身的不健全。譬如：好大求快不顾条件地多要钱，没有条件设计就要动工等等。这样的预算，上级是难以快批的，甚至是批不准的。这一点是我们提出基本建设要求的重要经验。而且预算的内容就是要钱的详细计划，就是包括：调查、设计、施工计划、拨款要求，定货和人员培养的详细计划，怎能说预算迟批会妨碍设计呢？
    关于“任务紧迫”的问题：国家并未要求我们只求快，不管技术干部有多少，而盲目进行基本建设。相反地却是一再指示我们根据资源、财力、人力等条件来进行详细的设计，先要办好，不要贪多。那么有没有任务紧迫的现象呢？有的，但其原因却主要是由于我们有些同志太着急了，热心工业建设，不大顾及条件，轻率动手，弄得工作被动；即所谓“主观”都是想办好的，但却走了弯路，欲速不达。这一点也是我们的重大教训，而不是辩解设计不周的客观理由。
    陈有功同志虽然列举了很多客观困难，但他自己也未能和“没有正确设计即行盲目施工”的主题联系起来。在他的意见的最后一段也只能说出“设计不周，还不是因为技术人员缺乏吗？”经验不足，干部缺乏是人所共知的情况，正因为如此，共同纲领才规定了我们的工业建设方针是：有计划有步骤地进行。政府的各种指示和决定，始终是贯彻着这个总的方针。但有些机关在执行这个方针时的情况就表示：照顾全局的精神还不明确，而是从局部的情况和需要出发，希图走近路（不愿认真设计），结果适得其反。因之，检讨我们已经发生的错误，应从基本建设的指导思想入手，从对待设计的态度入手。“客观原因”只能限制我们的量的发展，不应限制我们对于质的要求。尤其重要者是以如何的态度来努力克服客观的困难，力求进步。
    企业的基本建设中确有许多困难，诸如物资供应，交通运输，包工，拨款等等，这主要是施工过程中的问题。各级工作中的缺点是造成工作困难的一个方面，应用力克服，但对已经发生的错误，则务必采取严肃的态度，进行检讨。一味强调客观困难，只能妨害自己的进步。中央财政经济委员会颁发的“基本建设工作程序暂行办法”及政务院对这一问题的决定和指示，都还需要我们企业工作者好好学习，以改进工作。
