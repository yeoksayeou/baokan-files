　　Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
　　Zhang Lan
　　Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. All Chinese people and people all over the world are welcoming this great anniversary in Chinese history with the most excited and joyful enthusiasm. Today, on behalf of the China Democratic League, I would like to extend warm congratulations and high respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and to the Communist Party of China, the great party of the Chinese proletariat.
　　The feudal system ruled China for more than four thousand years. Imperialists oppressed China for more than one hundred years. The great China, with the longest history, the largest population, and the widest land in the world, was reduced to a colony, a semi-colony, and a semi-feudal country. In Chinese history, especially in the history of the last hundred years, patriotic Chinese people have explored various ways to save the country and tested many leaders of the revolutionary cause, but after all, the country did not look up and the people did not stand up.
　　Today is different. China's feudal ruling class has been overthrown by the Chinese people. The imperialists who oppressed China have been driven out by the Chinese people. Today's China is a new country of unprecedented unity in history, and today's China is a new country of complete independence, autonomy, glory, and happiness in the world.
　　How did the Chinese people achieve this great victory and achievement? This is the great victory and glorious achievement that the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, has achieved through thirty years of arduous struggle and long-term struggles with sweat and blood.
　　Now facts have proved that the Communist Party of China under the banner of Mao Zedong is the most reliable leader of the Chinese people, and the revolutionary road led by the Communist Party of China under the banner of Mao Zedong is the most correct road for the Chinese people to liberate themselves and build the country. We can definitely say that without the Communist Party, the vanguard of the proletariat, and without the Communist Party under the banner of Chairman Mao Zedong, there would be no new China.
　　At present, the Chinese revolution is only in the stage of the New Democratic Revolution. The work of building a new China is only the first step in a long march. The Chinese people must steadily and systematically move from a new democratic country to socialism. Today, China has a great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, a proletarian Communist Party of China, and a great and strong Chinese People's Democratic United Front led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. We will surely be able to sweep away all obstacles, overcome all difficulties, and victoriously complete our revolutionary tasks.
　　The Chinese revolution is part of the world revolution. The impact of the Chinese revolution on the global human liberation movement will certainly be the same as the impact of the Soviet October Revolution on the Chinese people's liberation movement. Chairman Mao Zedong once predicted: "This revolution is a thorough blow to imperialism, so it is not tolerated by imperialism and is opposed by imperialism." The war of aggression against Taiwan and aggression against Korea launched by the US imperialists has completely confirmed Chairman Mao's scientific prediction.
　　Today's era is a new era in which capitalism is bound to die and socialism is bound to prosper. Today, there is the great socialist advanced country of the Soviet Union in the world, and there are many emerging new democratic countries. Today, China has a great Chairman Mao Zedong, and four hundred and seventy-five million Chinese people who have stood up under the correct leadership of the great Communist Party. We will surely be able to smash all the aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists in the world. The Chinese people will surely be able to successfully undertake the task of stopping war and defending peace!
　　Finally, standing in the position of the China Democratic League, I would like to say a few more words. The China Democratic League is only ten years old today. In these ten years of revolutionary movement, if we had not received the help and leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, we would never have been able to guarantee that we would not take the wrong path, guarantee that we would be able to do our work well, and complete our tasks.
　　Today, when the people of the whole country are rejoicing and celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, let me say it again: Thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China for the correct leadership of the revolution! Congratulations to the great and glorious victory of our Chinese people!
　　Long live the Communist Party of China!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年纪念
    张澜
    今天是中国共产党建党三十周年的纪念日。全中国人民、全世界人民都以最兴奋最愉快的热情来迎接中国历史上这个伟大的纪念日。我今天代表中国民主同盟谨向毛泽东主席，中国人民伟大的领袖，谨向中国共产党，中国无产阶级伟大的政党，致以热烈的庆贺和崇高的敬意。
    封建制度统治了中国四千余年。帝国主义者压迫了中国一百余年。世界上历史最长，人口最多，土地最广的伟大的中国竟沦落成了殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的国家。在中国的历史上，特别在最近这百余年来的历史上，爱国的中国人民摸索过各种救国的道路，考验过不少的革命事业的领导者，毕竟国家没有抬头，人民没有翻身。
    今天不同了。中国的封建统治阶级被中国人民推翻了。压迫中国的帝国主义者被中国人民驱逐出去了。今天的中国是历史上空前未有的统一团结的新国家，今天的中国在国际上是一个完全独立、自主、光荣、幸福的新国家。
    中国人民这种伟大的胜利和成就是怎样得来的？这是中国共产党在伟大的毛泽东主席领导下，经过三十年的艰苦卓绝的奋斗，经过长期流汗流血的斗争所得到的伟大胜利和光荣的成绩。
    现在事实证明了毛泽东旗帜下的中国共产党，是中国人民最可信赖的领导者，毛泽东旗帜下中国共产党所领导的革命道路，是中国人民解放自己建设国家最正确的道路。我们可以肯定地说：没有无产阶级先锋队的共产党，没有毛泽东主席旗帜下的共产党，就没有新中国。
    目前中国的革命还只在新民主主义革命的阶段。建设新中国的工作，还只是万里长征走了一步。中国人民还要从新民主主义的国家稳步地和有计划地进入到社会主义。今天中国有了伟大领袖毛泽东主席，有了无产阶级的中国共产党，并且有了毛主席和中国共产党领导的伟大坚强的中国人民民主统一战线，我们必定能扫除一切障碍，克服一切困难，胜利地完成我们的革命任务。
    中国革命是世界革命的一部分。中国革命在全世界人类解放运动上所发生的影响，必定如苏联十月革命在中国人民解放运动上所发生的影响一样。毛泽东主席曾经预言过：“这种革命是彻底打击帝国主义的，因此它不为帝国主义所容许，而为帝国主义所反对。”美帝国主义者所发动的侵略台湾侵略朝鲜的战争，又完全证实了毛主席的科学预见。
    今天的时代是资本主义必然死亡与社会主义必然兴盛的新时代。今天的世界上有了伟大的社会主义先进国家苏联，有了许多新民主主义的新兴国家。今天的中国又有了伟大的毛泽东主席，有了伟大的共产党正确领导下的四万万七千五百万站起来了的中国人民，我们必定能粉碎世界上一切帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。中国人民必定能够胜利地担任制止战争保卫和平的任务！
    最后我站在中国民主同盟的地位，还要说几句话。中国民主同盟今天只有十年历史。在这十年的革命运动中，倘使我们没有得到毛主席和中国共产党的帮助和领导，我们也决不能保证我们不走上错路，保证我们能够做好我们的工作，完成我们的任务。
    在举国人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年的今天，让我再说一次：感谢毛主席和中国共产党对革命领导的正确！祝贺我们中国人民伟大而光荣的胜利！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
