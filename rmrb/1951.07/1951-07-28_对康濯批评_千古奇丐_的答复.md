Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editor:

The "People's Literature" section of your newspaper, issue No. 106, dated June 25th, carried a critical article by Kang Tuo. He said that "The Extraordinary Beggar of All Time" is "an extremely reactionary novel." Some of the points he criticized had already been reviewed by us before the article was published. There were also some points we had not noticed. After Comrade Kang Tuo raised them, we further reviewed them and deeply realized that we, intellectuals from petty-bourgeois backgrounds, have a superficial or even non-existent understanding of revolutionary theory and methods. Therefore, without deeply studying the book's stance, viewpoint, and method, we published it carelessly based solely on a simple profit-making motive. We admit that this was absolutely wrong. This book was sent to our store by Tianjin Knowledge Bookstore in October 1950, and our store purchased the copyright and published it. In the files of correspondence between our store, Knowledge Bookstore, and the author, we saw that the author "Bai Shui" is the pen name of "Yang Ruquan," who is an editor at Knowledge Bookstore (he said in a letter: I read the letter transferred from your store's editorial department accepting my humble work "The Extraordinary Beggar of All Time"). The editor-in-chief at the time was He Gongchao. Because Comrade Kang Tuo mentioned it in his criticism, we should explain this. Regarding this book, criticisms have already been raised in Shanghai's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Hui Bao." Our store stopped distributing the book from May 26th. All remaining copies have been inventoried and sealed, and a written report has been filed with the Shanghai Booksellers Association. We are now writing to report to your newspaper and request that this letter be published in your newspaper's readers' letters column so that readers can understand the actual situation of our store's handling of the book.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对康濯批评“千古奇丐”的答复编辑同志：
    六月二十五日贵报第一○六期《人民文艺》载有康濯的一篇批评文章。他说“千古奇丐”是“一本极端反动的小说”。其中所评各点，有几点我们在该文发表前已经检讨过。还有我们没有注意到的几点，经康濯同志提出后，我们又做过进一步的检讨；深深地体会到我们出身于小资产阶级的知识分子，对于革命理论和方法，确是一知半解，甚至不知不解，所以不加深刻研究这本书的立场、观点和方法，只凭单纯营利观点，便粗枝大叶地出版了。我们承认这是绝对错误的。此书是一九五○年十月天津知识书店寄给我店，由我店购买版权出版的。在我店与知识书店及作者通信案卷中看到作者“柏水”是“杨汝泉”的笔名，他是知识书店的编辑（他来信中说：读到我店编辑科转来接受拙作“千古奇丐”的来信）。当时主编人为何公超。因为康濯同志在批评中提到，我们应当说明一下。关于此书，在上海《大公报》、《文汇报》早已提出批评，我店早已于五月二十六日起即停止发行该书。所有存书，亦已清点封存，并书面报告上海市书业同业公会备案。今特具函报告贵报，并请将此函登贵报读者来信栏内，让读者明了我店处理该书的实际情况。
