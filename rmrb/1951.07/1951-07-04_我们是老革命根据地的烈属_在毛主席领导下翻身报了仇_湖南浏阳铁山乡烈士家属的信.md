To our beloved Chairman Mao:

Tieshan Township is one of the old revolutionary base areas. Revolutionary organizations were established as early as 1928, and peasant associations were formed. In 1929, the People's Democratic Government was established, and land was distributed. In 1931, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, led by Chen Guangzhong, invaded Yonghe and Guandu. The bandit troops stationed in Guandu were completely annihilated by our heroic 16th Red Army. The bandits then launched a large-scale burning and killing campaign in Tieshan, burning hundreds of houses to ashes and massacring over 200 workers and peasants. This plunged our township into more than 20 years of dark and lawless days, living a life of servitude. Revolutionary families were arrested, tortured, imprisoned, confiscated, looted, and subjected to all kinds of humiliation, leaving them homeless. Coupled with years of drought and floods, and livestock plagues, the suffering was indescribable.

Our savior, Chairman Mao, led the heroic People's Liberation Army across the Yangtze River, liberating South China. We emerged from the darkness, saw the light, overturned our fate, and took revenge. We defeated the landlord class, obtained the fruits of victory, had land to cultivate, and houses to live in. All of us, the families of martyrs, will do our best to support the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. We will fight for the liberation of Korea and Taiwan, and to defend our motherland.

          With utmost respect!

                        Revolutionary Martyrs' Dependents Committee of Tieshan Township, Second District, Liuyang

### 我们是老革命根据地的烈属  在毛主席领导下翻身报了仇——湖南浏阳铁山乡烈士家属的信

　　我们是老革命根据地的烈属
    在毛主席领导下翻身报了仇
    ——湖南浏阳铁山乡烈士家属的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我铁山乡是老革命根据地之一。一九二八年就有了革命组织，建立了农民协会，一九二九年成立了人民民主政府，分配了土地。到一九三一年，蒋介石匪帮陈光中部进占我永和、官渡地点，驻官渡的匪军被我英勇红十六军全部消灭。该匪即向我铁山进行大烧大杀，数百间房屋被烧成焦土，屠杀工农群众二百余名。致使我乡过着二十多年黑暗无天的日子，度着牛马生活。革命家属被拿捉拷打监禁，没收抄抢，种种凌辱，无家可归。兼之连年干旱水灾，六畜瘟疫，苦不堪言。
    救星毛主席，领导英勇人民解放军，渡江南下，解放华南，我们从黑暗中伸出了头，见着青天，翻了身，报了仇，打垮了地主阶级，得到了胜利果实，有田耕，有屋住。我全体烈属要尽力支援抗美援朝人民志愿军。为解放朝鲜台湾，保卫祖国而奋斗。
          此致敬礼！
                        浏阳第二区铁山乡革命家属委员会敬上
