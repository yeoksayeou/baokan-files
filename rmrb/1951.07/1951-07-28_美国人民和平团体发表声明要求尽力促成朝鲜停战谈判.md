　　American People's Peace Groups Issue Statements
　  Demanding Every Effort to Facilitate Korean Armistice Negotiations
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 26th: TASS reported from New York on July 26th: Police forbade a peace demonstration scheduled for July 24th at the United Nations headquarters. Participants in the demonstration represented ten peace groups including the "American Peace Crusade", "American Women for Peace Association", and "Black United Committee for Peace and Freedom". They put forward a pre-drafted statement urging the United Nations to instruct the military representatives in Korea to "no longer oppose including the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops on the agenda in the ceasefire negotiations". They said in the statement: "We ask this in the name of humanity, in the name of mothers and sons all over the world. We ask you to eliminate the shadow of war from the hearts of people everywhere. The only issue that currently divides the negotiating parties is whether the issue of the complete withdrawal of foreign troops should be included on the agenda... We firmly believe that an agreement on complete withdrawal of troops must be an inseparable part of the Korean armistice negotiations."

　　美国人民和平团体发表声明
　  要求尽力促成朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：警察禁止了订于七月二十四日在联合国总部举行的和平示威游行。这次示威的参加者代表“美国和平十字军”、“美国妇女争取和平协会”、“黑人争取和平与自由联合委员会”等十个和平团体。它们提出了预先拟就的声明，敦促联合国训令在朝鲜的军事代表“在停火谈判中不再反对把外国军队撤退的问题列入议程”。他们在声明中说：“我们以人类的名义，以全世界的母亲和儿子的名义要求这样做。我们要求你们消除各地人民心上的战争阴影。目前使谈判双方意见分歧的唯一问题，是外国军队全部撤退问题是否应该列入议程的问题……我们坚决认为：必须把关于全部撤军的协议，作为朝鲜停火谈判的不可分割的一部分”。
