　　Cultural Education Committee Member
    Fu Dingyi's "July 1st" Dedication
   (Celebrating Joint Article, with Postscript Attached)
    Thirty years, glorious beyond our borders,
    Two and a half Long Marches, soaring through the world.
    July 1, 1951, marks the grand celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. As we look back, since the founding of the Communist Party, we have experienced the First, Second, and Third Revolutionary War periods, then the War of Resistance Against Japan, and now the founding of the People's Republic of China. This kind of achievement is so remarkable, and this spirit is so outstanding. Up to the Resistance Against America and Aid Korea, the heroic struggle has defeated the United Sixteen Nations of Europe and America, preventing these imperialist countries from extending their reach into northern Korea. This kind of glory is unprecedented in Eastern history. Chairman Mao's leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is so great and glorious, it is the blessing of the People's Republic of China, and the common benefit of the people of all countries in the world.

    符定一“七一”献词         
   （庆祝联文，并跋语附后）
    三十周年，辉煌域外，
    二五长征，逴跞寰中。
    一九五一年七月一日，为中国共产党建党三十年纪念的大庆。我们回想，自共产党成立以来，经历第一次第二次第三次革命战争时期，又阅过抗日战斗时期，又经历人民共和国成立时期，这种功勋，是何等魁伟，这种精神，是何等卓绝。迄至抗美援朝，英勇奋斗，把欧美的联合十六国打垮，使这些帝国主义国家，莫能向朝鲜北部伸张。此种光荣，为东方历史所未有者。毛主席领导中国共产党的伟大光辉若此，斯中华人民共和国之福，亦世界各国人民共同之庥也。
