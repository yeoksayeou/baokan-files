Comrades, honored guests:

I am a Communist Party member of the People's Liberation Army. Our Party has cultivated me into a combat hero. This time, I am especially happy to be able to come to the capital of the motherland, Beijing, to participate in the "July 1st" anniversary celebration. I will never forget the education that our Party and Chairman Mao have given me.

Thinking back to fourteen years ago, I was just a firewood-gathering child from a poor peasant family, without enough to eat or wear. It was not until the Communist Party came that I, like countless working people, was able to stand up under the leadership and education of the Communist Party! Since joining the People's Liberation Army, I have gone through more than two hundred and fifty battles, large and small, and I have grown from an ordinary soldier into a commander of the People's Liberation Army.

In my fourteen years in the People's Liberation Army, I have deeply felt that it is because of the correct leadership of our Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that we have grown and become strong, that we have defeated the powerful enemies—the Japanese invaders, and the American invaders' running dog, Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang. Only in this way can we win every battle and overcome all kinds of difficulties in the battle, and only in this way can we cultivate ourselves into conscious and disciplined revolutionary soldiers. Everything we have is given to us by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! In the future, we believe that because of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we will certainly be able to build the People's Liberation Army into an even stronger, modern national defense force, which can defeat any imperialist aggressor and protect the motherland, protect the fruits of victory, and safeguard world peace!

I assure everyone that our Liberation Army soldiers will certainly accept the instructions of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, step up military training, and complete all the tasks assigned to them!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　中国人民解放军战斗英雄
    刘子林的讲话各位同志，各位来宾：
    我是人民解放军的一个共产党员。我们的党把我培养成了一个战斗英雄。这次，我能够来到祖国的首都北京参加“七一”节纪念大会，我感到特别的高兴。我永远忘不了我们党和毛主席给我的教育。
    回想起十四年前，我还是贫农家庭一个拾柴火的孩子，吃没吃，穿没穿，直到共产党来了，在共产党的领导和教育之下，我才和无数的劳动人民一样翻身了！自从参加人民解放军以来，经过大小二百五十多次的战斗，我从一个普通的战士，锻炼成了人民解放军的指挥员。
    我在人民解放军的十四年当中，深深地感到，由于有我们毛主席和共产党的正确领导，我们才发展壮大起来，我们才战胜了强大的敌人——日本强盗，和美国强盗的走狗国民党蒋介石，我们才能在战斗中百战百胜，才能克服了各种各样的困难，我们才把自己锻炼成有觉悟、有纪律的革命军人。我们的一切，都是毛主席和共产党给我们的！今后我们相信，因为有毛主席和共产党的英明领导，我们一定可以把人民解放军建设成更加强大的、近代化的国防军，这支军队能够打败任何帝国主义侵略者，能够保卫祖国，保卫胜利果实，保卫世界和平！
    我向大家保证，我们解放军的战士，一定接受毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府的指示，加紧练兵，完成自己担负的一切任务！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
