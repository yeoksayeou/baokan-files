　　Lenin told us, "The fundamental question of every revolution is the question of state power." This means that the fundamental task of the revolution is to destroy the rule of the old reactionary classes and establish the new rule of the people. Before Marxism-Leninism was introduced to China, many advanced Chinese people did not understand this truth. They advocated various ways to save the country, such as "constitutionalism to save the country," "education to save the country," "industrialization to save the country," and "new army to save the country." None of these methods worked. The bourgeoisie led the Xinhai Revolution, and although it overthrew the ruling power of the Qing Dynasty, it did not take power into its own hands. Instead, it voluntarily returned power to the feudal landlord class, so the Xinhai Revolution also failed. Only after the October Revolution in Russia did Chinese revolutionary intellectuals find the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism from the Russians. The Chinese working class formed its own vanguard, the Communist Party, following the example of the Russian working class, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, embarked on the correct path of revolutionary struggle.

　　The specific path taken by the Chinese revolution was different from that of the October Revolution. The October Revolution first occupied the cities and then the countryside, first seized the central government and then popularized it in the local areas. After the failure of the revolution in 1927, the Chinese revolution first relied on the rural areas, developed its strength, established armed forces, and built revolutionary base areas. Then, it progressed from small base areas to large base areas, from occupying vast rural areas to occupying cities, from partial liberation to national liberation, and from establishing local governments to establishing a national government. The reason why the Chinese revolution adopted this path is that China is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal big country. On the one hand, the enemy has long ruled the central cities with strong military force, and the working class cannot freely carry out revolutionary activities in the cities. The revolution must rely on the vast rural areas where the enemy's power is relatively weak, so as to accumulate and temper its own strength for a long time, and to avoid engaging in a decisive battle with the enemy too early. On the other hand, there are extremely sharp class contradictions in the rural areas, and there is a very large number of oppressed and disaster-stricken peasants who urgently demand liberation as a strong force for the revolution. Relying on the support of the peasants, the revolution can first achieve victory in the rural areas, and then develop outward, creating a situation in which the countryside surrounds the cities, and finally capturing the cities and completing national liberation. This is the practical significance of our party's long-term focus on rural areas and the establishment of revolutionary regimes in rural areas first.

　　On the fundamental issue of establishing revolutionary power, our party, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, waged a resolute struggle against various opportunist ideas within the party. During the Northern Expedition, Chen Duxiu's capitulationist elements in our party's leading organs, fearing a split in the united front, advocated "aloofness" and voluntarily gave up the control of power, thus causing the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War. In the early days of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, some comrades were satisfied with "fighting the world with arms" and lacked the concept of political power, ignoring the establishment and development of worker-peasant political power and revolutionary base areas. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a new capitulationist ideology similar to Chen Duxiu's emerged within the party, daring not to independently and autonomously establish anti-Japanese democratic regimes behind enemy lines, and daring not to establish liberated areas. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our party waged a resolute struggle against this erroneous idea that violated the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, thereby developing and strengthening the revolutionary army and the power of the revolutionary base areas in the severe struggle with enemies at home and abroad, and enabling the revolution to achieve national victory.

　　Today, the Chinese people have formed a state, and state power is in the hands of the people. This requires highly developing the concentrated and unified power of the state and fully using the weapon of state power. We should, through state power, on the one hand, continue to fight against the enemy, striving to completely overthrow the imperialist aggressive forces and eliminate the remnants of feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism. On the other hand, we should carry out economic and cultural construction to improve the people's economic and cultural lives, gradually transform old ideas, old morals, and old work styles, and establish new ideas, new morals, and new work styles, so that our China can complete the construction of new democracy and gradually move towards the road of socialism and communism. However, some cadres in our party still have a tendency to underestimate the important role of state power. They are not good at exerting the power of the people's democratic dictatorship to fight against the counter-revolutionaries, they are not good at systematically using the people's representative conferences and the people's congresses, the most excellent democratic systems, to consolidate the unity of all classes, to mobilize the people to actively participate in the management of state affairs, and they do not understand how to give play to the local initiative in adapting to local conditions under the principle of a high degree of unity and centralization throughout the country. There are even some comrades who are nostalgic for the past methods of independent and autonomous struggle in various places under the divided state of the liberated areas, and ignore the high degree of centralization and unity of state power. This is a concrete manifestation of the lack of a national concept and an overall concept, and needs to be strictly corrected.

　　On the other hand, there are also some comrades who believe that the people's acquisition of state power means that the revolution has been completely successful, and therefore our revolutionary task has come to an end. This view is also extremely wrong. Comrade Stalin said: "Bourgeois revolutions usually complete themselves by seizing state power, but for proletarian revolutions, seizing state power is only the beginning of the proletarian revolution, and state power must be used as a lever to transform the old economy and organize the new economy." The view that acquiring state power means the completion of the revolution is precisely a manifestation of the bourgeois viewpoint. In the eyes of Marxists, the people's acquisition of state power means that the people are standing in the position of the rulers of the state to realize the revolutionary task and to continue the revolution to the end.

　　Our present state power is the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. We must continue to consolidate this state power to unite the strength of the broad masses of the people, to protect the fruits of victory that the people have already obtained, and to fight against all enemies at home and abroad. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to guarantee the victory of the people's revolution and to oppose the restoration conspiracy of enemies at home and abroad. We must firmly grasp this weapon." (Opening speech to the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) Only by consolidating the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship can we gradually and systematically carry out the work of transforming our country in the economic and cultural fields. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The economic construction of new democracy must be led and guaranteed by the political power of new democracy. Without the politics of new democracy, there can be no economy of new democracy... Without the democratization of our country, without the development of the political power of new democracy, the economic development of new democracy and the industrialization of the country cannot be guaranteed." (Speech at the Third People's Representative Conference in Beijing)

　　The basic task of the Communist Party of China today is to lead the people of the whole country to strive for the further consolidation and development of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　In order to consolidate the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship, it is necessary to strengthen the people's armed forces and build a strong people's army and national defense force. The people's army is an important component of the people's state machine. It serves the people's state power, and its responsibility is to protect the people's state power and protect the people's interests. Chairman Mao said: "To strive to create a people's army is the responsibility of the people of the whole country and all democratic parties. Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people. On this issue, we must not make empty arguments." (On Coalition Government) The history of the Chinese revolution fully proves the importance of armed struggle and the army. It is precisely because the Communist Party of China created a strong people's army, the People's Liberation Army (its predecessor was the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army), in the long revolutionary struggle, and led this army to completely crush the Kuomintang reactionary army supported by US imperialism, that it won the victory of the revolution, overthrew Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary rule, and established the people's own power. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." (Foreword to The Communist) Comrade Mao Zedong's words are not only true of the past, but also completely applicable to the future. We must never think that, now that the people's state power has been established, there is no issue of armed struggle before us. As long as imperialism exists for one day, we cannot relax our armed struggle for one day. The purpose of US imperialism's aggression against Korea is to invade China. This proves that US imperialism is not reconciled to its failure in China and insists on invading China. Therefore, it is an important task for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship to conduct military education among the people, strengthen local armed forces and militia construction, strengthen our national defense forces in all aspects, and modernize the equipment of the People's Liberation Army. Some cadres in our party believe that since the revolution has been victorious, armed struggle is no longer important, so they do not pay attention to the construction of the army. This is a very dangerous idea of ​​peace and paralysis, which should be completely overcome.

　　In order to consolidate and develop the people's power, it is even more necessary to vigorously develop mass movements. One of the most important features of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship is its close connection with the broad masses of the people, and the source of its power lies here. Without the foundation of mass movements, our power cannot be consolidated. To establish state power, to maintain and consolidate this power, we can only rely on the revolutionary actions of the masses themselves, rely on the improvement of the consciousness and organization of the broad masses, rather than relying on the "acting on behalf of heaven" of a few heroes and heroines, nor on the "taking over the world" of the communists. The Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat, but "the vanguard alone cannot achieve victory" (Lenin). The role of the vanguard lies only in contacting the masses, organizing the masses, educating the masses, learning from the masses, becoming one with the masses, listening to the voices of the masses, understanding the urgent demands of the masses, and mobilizing and leading the masses to fight for the realization of these demands. Only by combining the struggles that are closely related to the vital interests of the masses, mobilizing the broad masses to rise up, and through the revolutionary actions of the masses, can we gradually realize the party's program and policies and consolidate our state power.

　　After the national victory, we took over a large number of new areas. In these new areas, we relied on military force to first eliminate the reactionary armed forces, and then established people's power. But we know that in these areas, the masses have not been mobilized, the peasants in the countryside, the workers in the cities, and other working people have not yet risen up, and the people's power is not yet consolidated. Therefore, after the end of the military and the establishment of governments at all levels, our main task is to mobilize the masses. In the countryside, we will mobilize the peasants through suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent and refunding deposits, and land reform; in cities, factories, mines, railways, ships, and docks, we will mainly mobilize the workers through suppressing counter-revolutionaries and anti-feudal democratic reform movements. In these movements, the consciousness and organization of workers, peasants, and other working people will gradually improve. This is the foundation of all work in the new areas. If this work is not done well, the masses are not mobilized or not sufficiently mobilized, it will not only be impossible to completely eliminate the remaining enemies, but also impossible to carry out production construction and cultural construction. If the creation process of many old liberated areas in the past, especially some old liberated areas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, was first to have the party, then through the party to mobilize the masses to struggle, all the way to armed riots, seize power, and then establish and expand the people's army to carry out armed struggle; then today's new liberated areas have reversed this process, that is, first build the army and the government, and then go to mobilize the masses. Only after the masses have been mobilized can we gradually build the party on a large scale. These are two different development processes of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. But no matter which process, it is certain that we cannot leave the mobilization of the masses. If there is only revolutionary military force and no revolutionary mass force, then the people's power in that area is not consolidated. The reason why our power is powerful and can do many things that the old power could not do, such as suppressing bandits, stabilizing prices, controlling water, and eliminating locusts, is because we have the support and help of the people. In the future, we will mobilize the strength of the people of the whole country to greatly develop the people's economic and cultural undertakings. But how can we do these undertakings well? Under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China has put forward the issue of taking the mass line in all work based on its own revolutionary experience. The Communist Party of China must implement the policy of relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses in all its work. However, in our party, some cadres still have a vague understanding of this basic principle. They do not understand that every task in our country is essentially a mass task, so they are busy with affairs and general work every day, and are accustomed to relying on simple administrative orders to carry out their work, but they neglect this basic work of mobilizing the masses, or just shout slogans in words, thus making various tasks fall into a passive state for a long time. Some comrades hold a purely task-oriented view, reducing rent for the sake of reducing rent, and carrying out land reform for the sake of land reform, without understanding that in any movement, we must focus on improving the consciousness and organization of the masses, strengthening the connection between the party and the people's government and the masses, and establishing the leadership of the party and the people's government over the masses, so as to continue to push the movement forward. Without these, our government work will lack a solid foundation.

　　Another important condition for the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship to be consolidated and developed is the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China. Without the leadership and guidance of the working class party—the Communist Party, the consolidation and development of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship is unimaginable. Our party has led the Chinese people to achieve the great victory of the revolution after thirty years of hard struggle, and has been recognized by the people of the whole country as a force that can correctly lead the country forward. The Common Program clearly stipulates that our state power is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and uniting the democratic classes and all nationalities in the country. The Chinese working class plays a leading role in the state power through its party—the Communist Party of China. Therefore, all Communist Party members must attach great importance to the work of state power construction and actively participate in this work, regarding it as the most important revolutionary work, and fight against all phenomena of underestimating or unwilling to do state power work. The new democratic government is a unified front government, so Communist Party members in government organs should pay attention to unified front work, and be good at uniting people from various democratic parties and non-party people to do this work well together.

　　Communist Party members should recognize that state power work is the basic work of the revolution and a long-term revolutionary work. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that one of the ultimate goals of the Communists is to eliminate state power, "but we do not want it now, and we cannot want it now. Why? Imperialism still exists, domestic reactionaries still exist, and domestic classes still exist. Our present task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, so as to protect national defense and protect the interests of the people. This is a condition that makes it possible for China to steadily advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society, eliminating classes and realizing great harmony." Therefore, all Communist Party members should recognize the importance and long-term nature of state power work, earnestly learn the skills of doing state power work, do state power work better, and make our power more consolidated.

　　Our party has led the Chinese people to establish a new people's power that has never existed in Chinese history. Our task in the future is to strive for the further consolidation and development of the people's power. A consolidated and powerful state power of the people's democratic dictatorship is the basic weapon for building a new democratic society and promoting it towards a socialist future.

　　为巩固人民民主专政的国家政权而奋斗
    ——纪念中国共产党成立三十周年
    邓子恢
    列宁告诉我们，“革命的基本问题是政权问题。”这就是说，革命的基本任务乃是破坏旧的反动阶级的统治，建立新的人民的统治。在马克思列宁主义还未传到中国以前，许多先进的中国人士不懂得这个真理，他们提倡过这样那样的救国道理，如“立宪救国”、“教育救国”、“实业救国”、“新军救国”之类，这些道理没有一个是行得通的。资产阶级领导辛亥革命，虽然推翻了满清统治政权，但并没有把政权拿到自己的手里来，反而自愿地把政权交还封建地主阶级，因此辛亥革命结果也失败了。只是在俄国十月革命之后，中国革命知识分子从俄国人那里找到了马克思列宁主义这个普遍真理，中国工人阶级按照俄国工人阶级的榜样组成了自己的先锋队共产党，中国人民才在共产党领导之下走上了正确的革命斗争的道路。
    中国革命所走的具体道路是和十月革命不同的。十月革命是先占领城市，而后占领乡村，先取得中央政权，而后普及地方。中国革命从一九二七年革命失败以后，则是先依据农村，发展力量，建立武装，建设革命根据地，然后由小块根据地到大块根据地，由占领广大乡村到占领城市，由局部解放到全国解放，由建立地方政权到建立全国政权。中国革命之所以采取这样的道路，是因为中国是一个半殖民地半封建的大国，一方面敌人长期以强大武力统治中心城市，工人阶级在城市中不可能自由进行革命活动，革命必需依据敌人力量比较薄弱的广大农村，才能在长时间内积聚和锻炼自己的力量，才能避免过早与敌人进行决战；另一方面在农村中有极尖锐的阶级矛盾，有极广大的受压迫受灾难迫切要求解放的农民作为革命的雄厚力量。依靠农民的支持，使革命可以先在农村取得胜利，而后再向外发展，造成乡村包围城市的形势，最后攻取城市，完成全国解放。这就是我们党长时期内把工作重心放在农村并首先在农村中建立革命政权的实际意义。
    在建立革命政权这个基本问题上，我们党以毛泽东同志为代表，曾和党内各种机会主义思想进行了坚决的斗争。在北伐战争时期，我党领导机关中的陈独秀派投降主义分子，因为害怕统一战线分裂，曾经提倡“清高”，自愿放弃政权的掌握，因而使第一次国内革命战争遭受了失败。在第二次国内革命战争初期，也有部分同志满足于“武装打天下”，而缺乏政权观念，忽视工农政权与革命根据地的建立与开展。在抗日战争初期，党内又出现了和陈独秀主义相类似的新投降主义思想，不敢在敌后独立自主地建立抗日民主政权，不敢建立解放区。我们党在毛泽东同志的领导下，和这种违背马克思列宁主义基本原则的错误思想进行了坚决的斗争，从而在和国内外敌人的严重斗争中，发展壮大了革命的军队和革命根据地的政权，才使革命取得了全国的胜利。
    今天，中国人民已经组成了国家，国家政权已经掌握在人民手里，这就需要高度发挥政权集中统一的威力，充分使用政权这个武器。我们应当经过政权，一方面继续与敌人作斗争，求得彻底打倒帝国主义侵略势力，肃清封建主义与官僚资本主义残余，另一方面进行经济建设与文化建设，以改善人民的经济生活和文化生活，逐步改造旧思想旧道德旧作风，建立新思想、新道德、新作风，使我们中国能够完成新民主主义建设，而逐渐走向社会主义与共产主义的道路。可是，在我们党内的一部分干部中，现在仍然存在着对于政权的重要作用认识不足的倾向。他们不善于发挥人民专政的力量来与反革命作斗争，不善于有系统地运用人民代表会议和人民代表大会这种最优良的民主制度来巩固各阶级团结，来动员人民积极参加国家事务的管理，不懂得在全国高度统一集中的原则下来发挥地方因地制宜的积极性。甚至还有一部分同志留恋于过去解放区被分割状态下各地独立自主进行斗争的一套作法，而无视国家政权的高度集中性与统一性。这是一种缺乏全国观念与整体观念的具体表现，需要加以严格的纠正。
    在另一方面，也有一些同志认为，人民取得政权，那就表示革命已经完全成功，因此我们的革命任务已经终结了。这种看法也是极端错误的。斯大林同志说：“资产阶级革命通常是以夺取政权来完成的，而对于无产阶级革命，夺取政权却只是无产阶级革命的开始，并且要把政权利用为改造旧经济和组织新经济的杠杆。”以为取得政权就是革命完成的看法，正是资产阶级观点的表现。在马克思主义者看来，人民取得政权，就是说人民站在国家的统治者的地位来实现革命任务，把革命继续进行到底。
    我们现在的国家政权是工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家政权。我们必须继续巩固这个国家政权，来团结广大人民的力量，保障人民已经获得的胜利果实，并和一切内外敌人进行斗争。毛泽东同志说：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利果实和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”（在人民政协第一届全体会议上的开幕词）也只有巩固人民民主专政的国家政权，才能逐步地、有计划地开展在经济和文化方面改造我们的国家的工作。刘少奇同志说：“新民主主义的经济建设必须有新民主主义的政权来领导和保障，没有新民主主义的政治，就不能有新民主主义的经济。……没有我们国家的民主化，没有新民主主义政权的发展，就不能保障新民主主义的经济发展和国家的工业化。”（在北京第三届人民代表会议上的讲话）
    中国共产党今天的基本任务，就是领导全国人民为更加巩固和发展人民民主专政的国家政权而奋斗。
    为了巩固人民民主专政的国家政权，就必须加强人民的武装力量，建设强大的人民军队和国防力量。人民的军队是人民的国家机器的重要组成部分，它是为人民国家政权服务的，它的责任即是保护人民国家政权，保护人民利益。毛主席说过：“为创造人民的军队而奋斗，这是全国人民及一切民主党派的责任。没有人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。对于这个问题，切不可发空论。”（论联合政府）中国革命的历史充分证明了武装斗争和军队的重要性。正是因为中国共产党在长期的革命斗争中创立了一支坚强的人民军队，即人民解放军（它的前身是中国工农红军），并领导这支军队彻底粉碎了美帝国主义支持的国民党反动军队，才取得了革命的胜利，推翻了蒋介石的反革命统治，建立起人民自己的政权。毛泽东同志说：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”（《共产党人》发刊词）毛泽东同志的这段话不但是说的过去，对于将来也是完全适用的。决不能以为，在人民的国家政权已经建立起来的时候，在我们面前就没有武装斗争的问题了。只要帝国主义存在一天，我们就一天不能放松武装斗争。美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，其目的就是侵略中国。这证明美帝国主义对它在中国的失败是不甘心的，是坚持要侵略中国的。因此，对人民群众进行军事教育，加强地方武装与民兵建设，从一切方面壮大我们的国防力量，使人民解放军的装备现代化，这是巩固人民民主专政的重要任务。我们党内有一部分干部认为革命既然已经胜利，武装斗争就不重要了，因此，就不重视军队的建设了，这是一种非常危险的太平麻痹思想，应加以彻底克服。
    为了巩固和发展人民政权，更必须大力发展群众运动。人民民主专政的国家政权的一个最主要的特色，就是它和广大人民群众有着密切的联系，它的力量的源泉也就在这里。离开了群众运动的基础，我们的政权是无法巩固的。我们要建立政权，要保持与巩固这个政权，只有依靠群众自己的革命行动，依靠广大群众觉悟性与组织性的提高，而不是依靠少数英雄豪杰的“替天行道”，也不是依靠共产党人的“包打天下”。共产党是无产阶级的先锋队，但是“单靠先锋队是不能取得胜利的”（列宁）。先锋队的作用只在于联系群众，组织群众，教育群众而又向群众学习，和群众打成一片，倾听群众的呼声，了解群众的迫切要求，发动并领导群众去为实现这些要求而斗争。只有结合群众切身利益的斗争，发动了广大群众起来，通过群众的革命行动，才能逐步实现党的政纲政策，才能巩固我们的国家政权。
    在全国胜利以后，我们接管了广大新区。在这些新区，我们依靠军事力量，首先扫除反动武装，随着建立人民政权。但我们知道，在这些地区群众未经过发动，乡村农民、城市工人及其他劳动人民尚未起来，人民政权还不是巩固的，因此在军事结束与各级政权建立之后，我们的主要任务，就是发动群众。在乡村中通过清剿土匪、反对恶霸、减租退押与土地改革去发动农民；在城市、工厂、矿山、铁路、轮船、码头中则主要通过镇压反革命及反封建的民主改革运动去发动工人。在这些运动中，使工人、农民和其他劳动人民的觉悟性与组织性逐步提高。这是新区一切工作的基础，这一工作做得不好，群众未发动或者发动得不充分，不仅不能彻底肃清残余敌人，而且也无法进行生产建设与文化建设。如果说过去许多老解放区特别是第二次国内革命战争时期有些老解放区的创造过程，是首先有党，再经过党去发动群众斗争，一直到武装暴动，夺取政权，而后再建立与扩大人民军队来开展武装斗争；那么今天的新解放区恰把这个程序颠倒过来，即是先建军、建政，而后再去发动群众，在群众已经发动之后，才大规模地逐步地建党。这是中国革命斗争两种不同的发展程序。但无论那种程序，都不能离开发动群众，则是确定的。如果只有革命的军事力量而没有革命的群众力量，那么那个地区的人民政权就是不巩固的。我们的政权所以有力量，所以能办好过去旧政权所办不了的许多事情，例如剿灭土匪，稳定物价，治水，灭蝗等等，也就是因为有了人民群众的支持和帮助的原故。在今后，我们就要动员全国人民的力量来大大发展人民的经济和文化事业。但是，如何把这些事业作好呢？中国共产党，在毛泽东思想领导下，根据自己的革命经验，提出了在一切工作中走群众路线的问题。中国共产党在一切工作中都要贯彻依靠群众、发动群众的方针。但是在我们党内，至今仍有某些干部对这种基本原则认识不清，他们不了解我们国家的每一项工作本质上都是群众工作，因而他们天天忙于事务、忙于一般工作，习惯于依靠简单的行政命令进行工作，对发动群众这种基础工作，却反而忽视，或者只在口头上空喊，因而使各种工作长期陷于被动。有些同志抱着单纯任务观点，为减租而减租，为土改而土改，不懂得在任何一个运动中，必须着重提高群众的觉悟性与组织性，加强党和人民政府与群众的联系，建立党和人民政府对群众的领导，才能继续把运动推向前进。离开这些，就会使我们的政权工作缺少巩固的基础。
    使人民民主专政的国家政权能够巩固和发展的另一个重要的条件，是中国共产党的正确领导。如果没有工人阶级的政党——共产党的领导和指导，人民民主专政的国家政权的巩固和发展是不可想像的。我们的党经过了三十年的艰苦奋斗，已经领导中国人民取得革命的伟大胜利，已被全国人民公认为能够正确的领导国家前进的力量。共同纲领上明确规定了我们的国家政权是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政的政权。中国工人阶级通过它的党——中国共产党在国家政权中起领导作用。因此，一切共产党员都必须十分重视政权建设工作，并积极参加这一工作，把这看作头等重要的革命工作，与一切轻视政权工作或不愿作政权工作的现象作斗争。新民主主义政权是统一战线的政权，所以共产党员在政权机关中要注意统一战线工作，要善于团结各民主党派人士及非党人士共同作好这一工作。
    共产党员应该认识政权工作是革命的基本工作，是一个长期性的革命工作。毛泽东同志在《论人民民主专政》中说，共产党人的最终目标之一就是要消灭国家权力，“但是我们现在还不要，我们现在还不能要。为什么？帝国主义还存在，国内反动派还存在，国内阶级还存在。我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益。以此作为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级及共产党的领导下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会，消灭阶级和实现大同。”因此，一切共产党员都应当认识政权工作的重要性和长期性，认真学习做政权工作的本领，把政权工作做得更好，使我们的政权更加巩固起来。
    我们的党已经领导中国人民建立了一个中国历史上从来没有过的新的人民的政权，我们今后的任务就是为更加巩固和发展人民政权而奋斗。巩固而有力的人民民主专政的政权，是建设新民主主义社会并推动它走向社会主义前途的基本武器。
