Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, Athens Dispatch: The Greek people, under the cruel rule of the Royalist Fascist government, are increasingly and forcefully resisting the tyranny of the Venizelos government.

Since the 7th, more than 70,000 civil servants across the country have launched a general strike, demanding a 50% increase in wages. The work of government agencies and public utilities, including postal services and transportation, has almost completely stopped throughout Greece. Among the various ministries of the Athens government, only the Ministry of Interior is barely maintaining operations. Despite the reactionary government's threats to deal with the striking civil servants with mobilization orders and court-martial them, the strike is still ongoing. Moreover, 30,000 employees of semi-governmental institutions have indicated that they will go on strike on the 10th. Dockworkers in Piraeus have joined the ranks of the strike.

This strike is the result of a long period of brewing discontent. As early as mid-June, civil servants across the country had demanded wage increases and announced that if their demands were not met, they would launch an indefinite strike starting in the first week of July. The movement to demand wage increases has also spread to many other industries. Workers at the British-owned water plants in Athens and Piraeus went on strike on June 25th, demanding wage increases. The Greek Railway Workers' Federation has instructed its local branches to prepare for strikes to fight for wage increases, and tobacco workers are also preparing to take similar action.

The mood of resistance also permeates the vast countryside. On June 24th, peasants in all the major towns of the Thessaly region, including Larissa, Karditsa, and Trikala, held large-scale demonstrations protesting the government's purchase of wheat at extremely low prices. Regarding this incident, even the royalist fascist newspaper "Vima" in Athens had to admit: "This year, the government suffered a defeat in grain acquisition, which has created a situation of extreme harm to national unity in the countryside." This incident has intensified the instability and division within the Greek ruling clique. Deputy Prime Minister Papandreou and other Social Democratic cabinet members, in order to ease popular anger, announced their withdrawal from the cabinet on July 1st, causing a crisis in the Athens government. While replenishing the cabinet, Venizelos has had to decide to hold a general election in the near future. At this moment, the outbreak of a nationwide civil servants' strike has further exposed how unstable the position of the Greek royalist fascist government is. Even "Vima" had to lament: "Dangerous cries can be heard everywhere in Greece."

### 反抗保皇法西斯政府暴政  希腊公务员总罢工

　　反抗保皇法西斯政府暴政
    希腊公务员总罢工
    【新华社九日讯】雅典消息：在保皇法西斯政府残酷统治下的希腊人民，日益有力地反抗维尼齐洛斯政府的暴政。
    自七日起，全国七万多名公务人员举行了总罢工，要求增加工资百分之五十。希腊全国各地政府机构的工作和公用事业包括邮政交通等，差不多完全停顿。雅典政府的各部仅内政部勉强维持工作。尽管反动政府威胁着要以动员令对付罢工的公务员和对罢工者进行军法审判，但是罢工仍在坚持中，而且，半政府机构的三万工作人员也表示将在十日举行罢工。比里犹斯的码头工人已参加了罢工的行列。
    这次罢工是长期酝酿的结果，早在六月中，全国公务员即已要求增加工资，并宣布如果要求不能满足，就要在七月的头一个星期起举行无限期罢工。要求增加工资的运动也遍及于许多其他行业中。雅典和比里犹斯两地的英商自来水厂工人曾在六月二十五日罢工，要求增加工资。希腊铁路工人联合会已训令各地方分会准备罢工以争取增加工资，烟草工人也准备采取同样行动。
    反抗的情绪也弥漫在广大农村中。上月二十四日，德萨利地区所有主要城镇，包括拉利萨、卡迪柴、特里喀拉等地的农民都举行了大规模示威游行，抗议政府用极低的价格来收买小麦。对于这一事件，雅典保皇法西斯的《维马报》都不得不承认：“今年政府在收购粮食方面打了一个败仗，这在农村中造成了一个极度危害国家团结的情势。”这一事件使希腊统治集团内部的不稳与分裂加甚，副首相巴邦德里奥及其他社会民主党阁员为了缓和人民的愤怒于七月一日宣布退出内阁，而使雅典政府发生了危机。维尼齐洛斯在补充阁员同时，已不得不决定在最近举行大选。就在这个时候，又爆发了全国公务员大罢工，更进一步暴露了希腊保皇法西斯政府的地位何等不稳。这连维马报都不得不悲鸣：“希腊全国各地到处都可以听到危险的呼声”。
