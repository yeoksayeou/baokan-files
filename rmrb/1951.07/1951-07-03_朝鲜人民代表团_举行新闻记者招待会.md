Xinhua News Agency, 1st. - The Korean People's Delegation to China held a press conference tonight. More than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists attended.

　　The head of the delegation, Won Dong-geun, delivered a speech. He said that one of the important significances of the Korean people sending a delegation to visit China this time is to express their heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the entire Korean people to the Chinese people for their support in the Korean people's war against the United States, and at the same time, to report to the Chinese people the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army and the confidence of the Korean people in winning the war against the United States.

　　Won Dong-geun then said: The people of Korea and China have forged an eternal friendship and unity with blood in the struggle against a common enemy. The great Chinese people have not only sent volunteers to the front lines in Korea to fight side by side with the Korean People's Army, but have also launched a movement to resist the United States and aid Korea throughout China. The delegation will bring this patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese people back to Korea.

　　Won Dong-geun expressed his hope that the press would accuse the American aggressor bandits of their atrocities in Korea to the people of the world, and tell the heroic deeds of the Korean and Chinese people fighting side by side and the Korean people's confidence in victory to the people of the world. He said: The inhuman massacres and barbaric destruction of the Korean people by American imperialism can never shake the Korean people's determination and confidence in victory in their struggle for national independence, freedom and peace.

　　After Won Dong-geun's speech, a discussion was held. Representatives of the Korean People's Delegation reported on the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side, introduced the tenacious and unyielding struggle stories of the Korean people, accused the various crimes of the American aggressor bandits, and answered questions raised by Chinese and foreign journalists.

    举行新闻记者招待会
    【新华社一日讯】朝鲜人民访华代表团于今晚举行新闻记者招待会。到会中外记者三十余人。
    该代表团团长元东根致词。他说：朝鲜人民这次派遣代表团来中国访问的重要意义之一，是代表全朝鲜人民对中国人民支援朝鲜人民抗美战争致衷心谢意，同时，向中国人民报告中国志愿军和朝鲜人军民并肩作战的英勇事迹以及朝鲜人民抗美战争的胜利信心。
    元东根团长接着说：朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中，以血凝成了永恒的友谊和团结。伟大的中国人民不仅派遣了志愿军到朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，而且在全中国范围内展开了抗美援朝运动。代表团将要把中国人民这种爱国主义和国际主义精神带回朝鲜去。
    元东根团长希望新闻界向全世界人民控诉美国侵略强盗在朝鲜的暴行，并把朝中人民并肩作战的英雄事迹和朝鲜人民的胜利信心告诉全世界人民。他说：美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的无人性的屠杀和野蛮的破坏，绝不能动摇朝鲜人民的为民族的独立、自由与和平而斗争的决心和胜利信心。
