　　How the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Leads the Donation Movement
    Lin Hong
    The Beijing industrial and commercial circles started the movement to donate airplanes and cannons earlier than anywhere else in the country. Recently, they decided to increase the number of airplanes pledged from twenty-seven to thirty-one airplanes and two cannons. Comparing this donation figure with the financial resources and business volume of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles, they are at the forefront of industrial and commercial circles in major cities across the country. Undoubtedly, their donation achievements have greatly promoted the cause nationwide. Their donation experience is worthy of reference for industrial and commercial circles throughout the country.
    The smooth and correct development of the donation movement in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles is mainly due to the following reasons:
    First, the Federation of Industry and Commerce understood the spirit of the call from the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and decided to lead industrial and commercial households in generally formulating donation plans focused on increasing production and improving management. On June 1st, when more than 1,200 representatives from various industries in Beijing gathered to listen to the report of the delegation to Korea, they passed a resolution to mobilize the city's industrial and commercial circles to donate weapons to support the front line. At that time, many industry representatives took the lead in donating. For example, Liu Wenjing, a representative of the construction industry, decided that his Jingye Construction Factory would donate one million yuan per month until the Korean War was won. Everyone's patriotic enthusiasm was quite high, but in general, it was limited to taking out a portion of their existing income to donate. In light of this situation, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce then held a meeting to discuss the significance of the donation movement. Everyone unanimously recognized that this donation movement was not only to support the Korean front and consolidate national defense, but also to enhance the political awareness of the industrial and commercial circles and promote the development and prosperity of Beijing's industry and commerce through this movement. Therefore, the Federation of Industry and Commerce clearly stipulated the following donation methods: (1) Donate from existing production and business profits; (2) Donate by increasing production, improving management, and saving; (3) Donate from personal income. The central task was to mobilize industrial and commercial households to formulate donation plans to increase production and income. In this way, the donation movement of the city's industrial and commercial circles was introduced into the correct direction of development.
    Secondly, the Federation of Industry and Commerce adopted the method of cultivating typical examples, drawing on experience, and promoting them in an all-round way. There are more than 40,000 industrial and commercial households in Beijing. Although everyone's patriotic enthusiasm is quite high, their level of political awareness varies. In particular, most industrial and commercial households lack experience in combining production and business to formulate donation plans. In order to solve this problem, the Federation of Industry and Commerce decided to take the cultivation of typical industries and typical industrial and commercial households and promote them as the first step. In just a few days, the Federation of Industry and Commerce concentrated manpower to help three industries and some industrial and commercial households formulate donation plans. Then, at the mobilization meeting of industrial and commercial circles for donating weapons held on June 10, the experience of typical industries and typical households in formulating donation plans was introduced. After the meeting, various industries and industrial and commercial households in the city, based on these typical experiences, began to formulate donation plans for their respective industries and for each industrial and commercial household.
    To formulate a good donation plan, it is necessary to first get through the minds of the heads of the trade associations in an industry, and help them cultivate and grasp a group of activists. In this regard, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Association did a better job. After listening to the report of the delegation to Korea, the head of the association immediately convened a meeting of representatives of a dozen households with clearer political understanding and the largest capital in the industry. After in-depth research and discussion, everyone reached a consensus on the significance and direction of the donation movement. Then, they jointly analyzed the situation of the industry and determined the industry's donation plan. Then, they convened a meeting of representatives of four or fifty households with larger capital in the industry to solicit their opinions on the donation plan. Finally, at the industry-wide meeting, the plan to donate an airplane was successfully passed. However, the industry's donation plan mainly determines the donation figure based on the industry's situation, and how to combine the donation plan with increasing production and improving management can only be stipulated in principle. Therefore, the further and more important task is to mobilize industrial and commercial households to formulate donation plans. According to the experience of typical households, such a donation plan must be formulated through consultation between labor and management in order to ensure its realization. For example, Ruifuxiang Silk and Cloth Store first convened a labor-management consultation meeting. After research and discussion between the two parties, the patriotic covenant was revised, and it was unanimously agreed to strive to increase the business turnover in the second half of the year by 4 billion yuan compared with the same period last year. This will not only ensure the completion of the store's plan to donate 400 million yuan in half a year, but also promote the development of its business. After the labor-management consultation meeting, the workers held group meetings and decided to launch a business competition.
    Third, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce conducted extensive publicity and education to the industrial and commercial circles in the donation movement. After the mobilization meeting, the Federation of Industry and Commerce immediately absorbed the activists who emerged in the early stage of the donation movement and formed a Resist America, Aid Korea Donation Committee. It was divided into seven groups, each group was responsible for promoting the donation work of about 20 industries, and each person was further assigned to be responsible for several industries. From the beginning of the donation movement, the Federation of Industry and Commerce designated cadres to specifically assist the industrial and commercial circles in formulating donation plans. In the process of carrying out the donation movement, each industry convened meetings of members of the trade association, joint meetings of group leaders, and meetings of various group leaders from top to bottom according to the organizational system. After repeated publicity and education to get their ideas straight, they formulated industry or household donation plans. After the news of the Korean armistice negotiations came out, the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, in view of the possibility that the industrial and commercial circles might have illusions about this and slacken their work on donating weapons, convened a meeting of more than 1,000 representatives of various industries in the city on July 3 to help everyone correctly understand the current situation and make everyone unanimously recognize the necessity of continuing to promote the donation movement. After the meeting, various industries generally held the same meeting. Therefore, the Korean armistice negotiations not only did not affect the donation movement of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles, but also pushed this movement forward. After the meeting, many industries and industrial and commercial households expressed that they would complete the donation plan ahead of schedule. For example, Daoxiangcun Food Store originally planned to deliver the June donation on the 10th of this month, but donated it ahead of schedule on the 4th. The donation figure of the automobile industry increased by more than 20 million yuan compared with the original 250 million yuan. At present, the donation movement of the city's industrial and commercial circles is developing forward. As long as the Donation Committee can assist various industries and industrial and commercial households in discovering and solving various problems that may occur in the future at any time, the successful completion of the donation plan of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles is guaranteed.

　　北京工商联怎样领导捐献运动
    林洪
    北京市工商界展开捐献飞机大炮运动，在全国说来是最早的。最近他们又决定把认捐的数字由二十七架飞机增加为三十一架飞机和两门大炮。以这个捐献数字与北京工商界的资力和营业数量作比较，他们是走在全国各大城市工商界的最前面了。毫无疑问，他们的捐献成绩，对于全国各地是有很大推动作用的；他们捐献的经验是值得全国各地工商界参考的。
    北京工商界的捐献运动能够这样顺利和正确开展起来，主要有下面几个原因：
    首先是工商联合会领会了抗美援朝总会号召的精神，确定领导工商户普遍订立以增加生产、改善经营为内容的捐献计划。六月一日，当北京工商界各行业代表一千二百多人集会听取了赴朝慰问团代表的报告，通过了发动全市工商界捐献武器支援前线的决议后，当时就有许多行业代表带头捐献。如营造业代表刘文敬决定他所经营的敬业营造厂每月捐献一百万元，直到朝鲜战争胜利为止。大家的爱国热情相当高，但一般还是限于从现有收入中提出一部分来捐献。根据这种情况，北京市工商联接着开会讨论了捐献运动的意义。大家一致认识到：这一次的捐献运动不但是为了支援朝鲜前线和巩固祖国国防，同时还要通过这一运动提高工商界的政治认识，促进北京工商业的发展和繁荣。因此工商联明确规定了如下的捐献办法：（一）从现有生产和营业的盈利中捐献；（二）用增加生产、改善经营和节约的方法来捐献；（三）从个人的收入中捐献。而中心的工作是发动各工商户订立增加生产、增加收入的捐献计划。这样，就把全市工商界的捐献运动引入了正确的发展方向。
    其次，工商联采取了培养典型，吸取经验，全面推广的方法。北京工商业共有四万多户，虽然大家的爱国情绪相当高，但政治觉悟程度高低不一，特别是要结合生产和营业订立捐献计划，一般工商户都缺乏经验。为了解决这个问题，工商联便决定以培养典型行业和典型工商户并加以推广，作为第一步工作。在短短几天中，工商联集中人力，帮助三个行业和一些工商户订立了捐献计划。接着就在六月十日召开的工商界捐献武器动员大会上，介绍了典型行业和典型户订立捐献计划的经验。会后，全市各行业和各工商户依据这些典型经验，着手订立本行业和每一工商户的捐献计划。
    要把捐献计划订好，在一个行业中须首先打通同业公会负责人的思想，并帮助他们培养与掌握一批积极分子。在这一方面，新药业同业公会作得较好。该业公会负责人在听了赴朝慰问团代表的报告后，即召集政治认识较清楚而又是该业中资力最大的十几户的代表会议，经过深入的研究讨论，大家对捐献运动的意义和方针取得了一致的认识。然后共同分析了该业的情况，确定了该业的捐献计划。接着又召集了该业中资力较大的四、五十户的代表开会，征求他们对捐献计划的意见。最后在全行业会上，顺利地通过了捐献一架飞机的计划。不过，行业的捐献计划，主要是根据本业情况确定捐献数字，如何使捐献计划与增加生产、改善经营相结合，还只能作原则上的规定。因此，进一步的更重要的工作是发动各工商户订立捐献计划。根据典型户的经验，这样的捐献计划必须由劳资双方协商订立，才能够保证其实现。如瑞蚨祥绸布店就是先召开劳资协商会议，双方研究讨论后，修订了爱国公约，一致同意争取下半年的营业流水比去年同一时期增加四十亿元。这样不但能够保证完成该店半年捐献四亿元的计划，还会使业务获得发展。劳资协商会议后，工人即召开小组会，决定展开业务竞赛。
    第三，北京工商联在捐献运动中，普遍地向工商界进行了充分的宣传教育。动员大会后，工商联即吸收捐献运动初期涌现出来的积极分子，组成了抗美援朝捐献委员会。下分七个小组，每组负责推动约二十个行业的捐献工作，每个人再分工负责几个行业。从捐献运动开始，工商联即指定干部，专门协助工商界订立捐献计划。每个行业在展开捐献运动的过程中，都按照组织系统，从上到下地召开了同业公会委员的会议、小组长联席会议、各小组长会议，经过反复宣传教育，打通思想后，才订立行业或户的捐献计划。在朝鲜停战谈判的消息传出后，北京工商联鉴于工商界可能对此发生错觉而松懈捐献武器的工作，所以在七月三日就召开了全市各行业代表一千多人的会议，帮助大家正确地认识了目前的时局，使大家一致认识了继续推进捐献运动的必要性。会后各行业又普遍召开了同样的会议。因此朝鲜停战的谈判，不但没有影响北京工商界的捐献运动，而且把这一运动向前推进了一步。在会议后，许多行业和工商户都表示要提前完成捐献计划。如稻香村食品店原计划在本月十日交付六月份的捐款，在四日就提前捐献了。汽车业的捐献数字，比原来的两亿五千万元增加了两千多万元。现全市工商界的捐献运动正在向前发展中。只要捐献委员会能够随时协助各行业和工商户发现、解决今后可能发生的各种问题，北京工商界的捐献计划的胜利完成是有保证的。
