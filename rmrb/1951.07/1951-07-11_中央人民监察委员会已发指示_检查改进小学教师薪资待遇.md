    Central People's Supervisory Committee Issues Instructions to Inspect and Improve the Salaries and Benefits of Primary School Teachers

Editor,
    The "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on June 12 published the opinions of the Hebei Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese Education Union on the salary issues of primary school teachers in more than ten counties including Qingyuan, Hebei. According to their report: At present, primary school teachers not only have low salaries, but also in many counties in the province, the method of paying primary school teachers' salaries still involves converting rice at low prices, issuing bad rice, and converting miscellaneous grains at unreasonable prices. These situations make it impossible for primary school teachers to work with peace of mind.
    In order to thoroughly correct this unreasonable phenomenon and to ensure the development of primary school education, this committee has sent a letter to the Hebei Provincial People's Supervisory Committee to conduct an inspection together with the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, and to formulate solutions to be submitted to the Provincial People's Government for instructions to the counties for implementation. This committee understands that there are also many unreasonable phenomena in the salary regulations and salary payment methods of primary school teachers in other regions. It is hoped that the People's Supervisory Committees and relevant agencies in various places will also pay attention to correcting them.

          People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government

    中央人民监察委员会已发指示
    检查改进小学教师薪资待遇编辑同志：
    六月十二日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊载了中国教育工会河北省工作委员会对河北省清苑等十余县小学教员薪资问题的意见。根据他们反映：目前小学教员不但薪金较低，在该省许多县小学教员发薪办法中，还存在着小米低价折款、发坏米、折发杂粮价格不合理等现象。这些情况，就使小学教员工作不能安心。
    为了彻底纠正这种不合理的现象，以保障小学教育工作的开展，本委员会已函示河北省人民监察委员会会同省文教厅进行检查，并拟定解决办法，提请省人民政府指示各县执行。据本委员会了解，其他地区小学教员的薪资规定及其发薪办法也有许多很不合理的现象。希望各地人民监察委员会及有关机关亦予注意纠正。
          中央人民政府人民监察委员会
