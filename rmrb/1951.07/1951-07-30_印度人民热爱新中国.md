　　Indian People Love New China
　　Xie Yong
  I. Chairman Mao Badges
    In late February of this year, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation, at the invitation of the Indian National Sports Association, sent a sports tourism delegation to India to visit the Asian Games held in New Delhi, India from March 4th to 11th. In order to express the concern of the people of New China for the people of India and the athletes from Asian countries participating in the Games, and to strengthen friendship with each other, the tourism delegation brought some gifts from China to present to them. Among the gifts from the tourism delegation, Chairman Mao badges and colored pictures with images of the people's leader were the most numerous. However, due to the love and respect of the broad masses of the Indian people and the athletes from Asian countries participating in the Games for our people's leader, these two kinds of gifts were still not enough to distribute, and many people felt very regretful for not receiving them.
    At noon on March 11th, just as the comrades of the tourism delegation returned to their dormitory from the sports field, four Iranian athletes came, each holding a commemorative album to ask the members of our tourism delegation to sign. They pointed to the Chairman Mao badges worn by the members of the tourism delegation and asked with a smile, "Is this Mao Zedong?" The answer was, "Yes." They looked at it with admiration. At this time, the comrades of the tourism delegation took out a few Chairman Mao badges, and the four people rushed forward together, snatching them before they could be distributed. The comrades of the tourism delegation then took out a few sets of colorful pictures. When they saw images of Stalin and Chairman Mao, they pointed to the pictures and said, "Stalin!" "Mao Zedong!" When they left, they asked to take a photo with the tourism delegation. When taking the photo, they all hung the Chairman Mao badges on their chests, and one of them was holding a picture of Chairman Mao in his hand, wanting to have these precious souvenirs photographed together.
    On the evening of the 12th, eight more Iranian athletes came to the dormitory of the tourism delegation, saying they were here to say goodbye. One of them asked the tourism delegation to give them a few Chairman Mao badges. The comrades of the tourism delegation gave each of them a badge, and they said in unison, "The Iranian people all love Mao Zedong. Please give us at least fifty more, so we can give them to our classmates and friends when we go back..." As a result, we gave them ten more.
    After the Games, the tourism delegation went to cities such as Bombay to visit schools. On the day they visited the Madras YMCA sports school, it was a school holiday. The tourism delegation estimated that they would not encounter many students. Who knew that when they arrived, there were still quite a few students at the school. The Chairman Mao badges worn by the members of the tourism delegation were seen by them. Several students asked for them. One member gave his only badge to a student named Bauer. After receiving it, he tightly grasped the comrade's hand, hung the badge on his chest, and expressed his gratitude.
    On March 20th, the tourism delegation visited the Bombay Sports College. In order to thank the students of the school for their warm welcome, the tourism delegation gave all of the more than sixty Chairman Mao badges they had brought with them to them. When giving out the badges, they surrounded the members of the tourism delegation into several circles. Among the students surrounding Comrade Yang Daoxin were the two daughters of Principal Joseph of the school. Comrade Yang gave his only Chairman Mao badge to the older girl. The younger girl did not receive one and was so anxious that she was about to cry, making Comrade Yang not know what to do. Later, he gave her a red handkerchief with a printed dove of peace, which made everyone feel happy.
    When the members of the tourism delegation got into the car to leave, there were still people reaching out to the car window for badges, but there were really none left. The comrades of the delegation had no choice but to reach out their hands and shake hands with them; they enthusiastically waved goodbye to the tourism delegation and shouted, "Wish you a safe journey! Bring more Mao Zedong badges next time!"
  II. Warm welcome
    Before the tourism delegation went to India, they had heard from comrades who had been to India that the representatives of New China would receive a warm welcome from the Indian people everywhere they went. When the tourism delegation arrived in India, this was indeed the case. During the period of participating in the Games in New Delhi, every time the tourism delegation appeared at the venue, many Indians would run over to shake hands, talk, and inquire about the situation in New China. In the end, they would ask the members to give them autographs. They all felt very honored and happy to be in contact with the representatives of New China. One day, the tourism delegation went to watch the basketball game between the Iranian team and the Philippine team. As soon as they sat down, more than ten students from Delhi University came and surrounded them, asking for autographs. But later, more and more people came, and the members were too busy to handle it, and it delayed watching the game. Under these circumstances, someone among them took the initiative to suggest signing after watching the game. Sure enough, two students sat with the members of the tourism delegation for half an hour until the game ended, and they asked for their autographs before leaving.
    When visiting Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and other cities, and visiting schools and factories, the tourism delegation received a warm welcome and hospitality everywhere. The representatives of the People's Liberation Army, who had won hundreds of battles in the motherland's liberation war, were especially respected. At the welcoming banquet at the Bombay Sports College, Principal Joseph asked the tourism delegation to introduce all the members to the students of the school. So, Chief Wu Xueqian got up and introduced all the members one by one. Every time a member was introduced, it aroused a long-lasting burst of applause; when the representative of the People's Liberation Army's sports work was introduced, the applause was even louder, interrupting Chief Wu's words several times. At the same time, countless students reached out to shake hands with the representatives of the People's Liberation Army.
    After visiting the school, the tourism delegation went to the suburban area to visit textile workers. Nearly two thousand workers (including some of the workers' children) warmly welcomed them in the square and performed Indian sports—wrestling. During the visit, many worker brothers asked the members of the tourism delegation to go around the venue once, so that they could carefully see the representatives of New China. When the members just stood up and walked into the venue, the worker brothers all used the highest Indian etiquette (putting their hands together in front of their chests) to express their respect, and the members also returned the salute in the same posture. Before half a circle was completed, a burst of applause suddenly erupted in the venue, followed by the slogans "Welcome the people of Qin State (that is, China—in Indian)!" "Welcome Chinese representatives!" At this time, a worker's child squeezed out of the crowd, saluted the members of the tourism delegation, and shook hands tightly with Comrade Yang Daoxin; then countless hands were stretched out, so the order of the venue was also disrupted. When the comrades of the tourism delegation walked out of the venue, countless workers followed behind them and quickly surrounded their car, and then enthusiastically stretched out their hands. The members shook hands with them one by one in front, back, left, and right… This made the comrades of the tourism delegation feel that they were not abroad, but at their own home, with their own brothers. The enthusiasm and friendship of the textile worker brothers in Bombay towards the tourism delegation made the members really feel a little reluctant to leave when they were about to depart.
    In Calcutta, the tourism delegation visited five schools, including the West Bengal Provincial Sports School, Girls' Primary School, and Senior Normal School, and three clubs. In order to welcome the tourism delegation, some schools organized all teachers and students to line up, playing music, and come to the school to greet them; some prepared a large number of fresh flowers to present to the tourism delegation, and rich refreshments were prepared wherever they went. The Girls' Primary School also held a special welcoming meeting. The old principal gave a welcoming speech with exceptional excitement. He said, "We are very happy that the New China tourism delegation can come here today. Our two countries, India and China, have had friendly relations in history. Later, due to imperialist aggression, the development of relations between us was restricted. Today, we must closely join hands to build Asia together." Then, Chief Wu Xueqian gave a reply, saying, "China and India are the two largest countries in Asia, with a combined population of nearly 800 million. As long as we unite, we will definitely be able to defeat any imperialism. The two major nations of China and India unite to crush the aggression of the US imperialist bloc and jointly strive to defend Asia and defend world lasting peace to the end!" At this time, the old principal led all the students to shout "Long live New China!" "Long live the people's China!" "Long live the people's Republic!"
    After the meeting, the tourism delegation presented each school with a copy of the books, picture albums, photos, and records they brought as gifts, as a souvenir, and wished the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people further consolidation and development.

　　印度人民热爱新中国

  一、毛主席纪念章
    今年二月底，我全国体育总会筹备委员会应印度全国体育协会的邀请，派遣了赴印体育观光团，赴印参观三月四日至十一日在印度新德里召开的亚洲运动会。为了表示新中国人民对印度人民和参加运动会的亚洲各国运动员的关怀，并加强彼此之间的友谊，观光团特从国内带了一些礼品准备赠送给他们。观光团的礼品中，以毛主席纪念章和印有人民领袖像的彩色画片数目最多。但是由于广大的印度人民和参加运动会的亚洲各国运动员对我人民领袖的敬爱，这两种礼品还是不够分配，许多人因为没有得到而感到非常遗憾。
    三月十一日中午，观光团的同志们刚从运动场回到宿舍，就来了四位伊朗的运动员，他们每人都拿着一个纪念册要我国观光团的团员签名。他们指着观光团团员同志们身上佩的毛主席纪念章，笑着问道：“这是毛泽东吗？”回答说：“是的。”他们敬慕地目不转睛地看着它。这时，观光团的同志拿出几个毛主席纪念章来，四个人一齐拥上来，等不及分发就抢走了。观光团的同志又拿出几套五彩画片，他们看到有斯大林和毛主席的像，就指着画片说：“斯大林！”“毛泽东！”他们临走的时候，要求和观光团合拍一张照片。在拍照时，他们都把毛主席纪念章挂在胸前，有一位手里还拿着一张毛主席像，他们要让这些珍贵的纪念品一起拍入镜头。
    十二日的晚上，又有八位伊朗的运动员来到观光团的宿舍，说是来告别的，其中有一位要求观光团送他们几个毛主席纪念章的。观光团的同志把纪念章每人送给一个，他们异口同声地说：“伊朗人民都热爱毛泽东，最少再给我们五十个，回去好转送给同学和朋友……”结果我们又送他们十个。
    运动会结束后，观光团就到孟买等城市去参观学校。在参观马德拉斯青年会体育学校的那天，正是学校的假日，观光团估计遇不到很多的学生，谁知去了之后，在校的学生还是不少。观光团员身上佩的毛主席纪念章被他们看见了，有几个学生就要，有一位团员把仅有的一个送给一个名叫鲍尔的学生，他接过之后，紧紧地握住那位同志的手，把纪念章挂在胸前，表示感谢。
    三月二十日，观光团参观孟买体育专科学校。为了感谢该校学生欢迎的盛意，观光团把随身带的六十多个毛主席纪念章都送给了他们。在送纪念章时，他们把观光团员围成几个圈子，围着杨道新同志的学生群中，有该校究瑟夫校长的两个女孩。杨同志把仅有的一个毛主席纪念章送给了大女孩，小女孩没有得到，急得要哭，闹得杨同志不知如何是好，后来他把随身带的印有和平鸽的一块红手帕送给她，才使得大家都感到欢喜。
    当观光团团员们上了汽车要走时，还有人把手伸向车窗要纪念章，但是实在没有了，团员同志们只好把手伸出去和他们握手；他们热情的向观光团挥手送别，并且高声说：“祝你们一路平安！再来时多带毛泽东纪念章来！”
  二、热烈的欢迎
    在观光团未去印度之前，就听到去过印度的同志讲：新中国的代表到了印度，到处都要受到印度人民的热烈欢迎。当观光团到了印度之后，确实是这样。在新德里参加运动会的期间，观光团每次出现在会场上时，总有不少的印度人跑来握手、谈话、打听新中国的情况，末了还要团员们给他们签名。同新中国的代表接触，他们都感到非常光荣和愉快。有一天，观光团去参观伊朗队对菲律宾队的篮球赛，刚坐下来，就来了十多个德里大学的学生，围着要求签名，但以后人愈来愈多，团员们实在忙不过来，而且耽误看球，在这种情况下，他们中间就有人自动提议看完球再签。果真有两位学生同观光团员们在一起坐了半小时之久，直到球赛结束，要求签了名才走。
    在访问孟买、马德拉斯、加尔各答等城，参观学校和工厂时，观光团到处受到热烈的欢迎和招待。在祖国解放战争中百战百胜的人民解放军的代表，特别受到人们的崇敬。在孟买体育专科学校的欢迎晚会上，究瑟夫校长要求观光团把全体团员向该校学员作一介绍，于是吴学谦团长起来把全体团员一一介绍了，每介绍一个团员时，都引起一阵经久不息的鼓掌；当介绍到人民解放军的体育工作代表时，掌声越发响亮，好几次打断了吴团长的话。同时，周围有数不清的学生们都伸出手来，要和人民解放军的代表握手。
    在参观过学校后，观光团又到城郊区去访问纺织工人。将近两千工人（包括一部分工人的子弟）在广场上热烈地表示欢迎，并且表演了印度的体育——摔跤。在参观时，有不少工人兄弟要求观光团员最好绕场一周，好能让他们仔细地看看新中国的代表。当团员们刚站起来向场内走时，工人兄弟们一齐用印度最高尚的礼节（两手相并，放在胸前）表示致敬，团员们也以同样的姿式回敬了他们。还没有走完半周，场上忽然掀起一阵掌声，随后就响起了“欢迎秦国（即中国——印度话）人民！”“欢迎中国代表！”的口号声。这时，有一个工人的孩子从人群中挤出来，向观光团的团员们敬了一个礼，并且同杨道新同志紧紧地握手；接着无数的手都伸过来了，因此，会场的秩序也乱起来了。观光团的同志走出会场时，身后有无数的工人跟随着，并且很快地把他们的汽车围起来，接着又都热情地伸出手来，团员同志们便前后左右一一地握着……这使得观光团的同志们觉得自己并不像在国外，而是像在自己的家里，是同自己的亲兄弟在一起。孟买的纺织工人兄弟们对观光团的热情与友爱，使得团员同志们在临走时实在觉得有些依依难舍了。
    在加尔各答，观光团参观了西孟加拉省体育学校、女子小学、高级师范等五个学校，三个俱乐部。为了欢迎观光团，有的全校师生排着队，奏着乐，到校外来迎接；有的准备了大批的鲜花献给观光团，并且所到之处都预备了丰富的茶点。女子小学还特别开了一个欢迎会。老校长异常兴奋地致欢迎词，他说：“今天新中国观光团能来到这里，我们感到非常高兴。我们印、中两国在历史上有着友谊关系，后来因为帝国主义的侵略，使彼此之间的关系的发展受到限制。今天我们要亲密地携起手来，共同建设亚洲。”接着吴学谦团长致答词，他说：“中国和印度是亚洲两个最大的国家，人口合起来近八万万，只要我们团结起来，一定能战胜任何帝国主义。中、印两大民族团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义集团的侵略，共同为保卫亚洲、保卫世界持久和平而奋斗到底！”这时，老校长领导全体学生高呼“新中国万岁！”“人民的中国万岁！”“人民的共和国万万岁！”
    会后，观光团将带去的书籍、画报、照片和唱片等礼品每一学校送给一份，以作纪念，并祝中、印人民友谊进一步地巩固与发展。
