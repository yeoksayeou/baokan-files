Shandong Provincial People's Government Stipulates Inspection Content and Methods

[This Newspaper's News] The Shandong Provincial People's Government issued instructions on July 16 regarding the inspection of veteran support work, requiring all subordinate levels of People's Governments to conduct a comprehensive and thorough inspection of veteran support work around the "August 1st" Army Day. The instructions pointed out that the purpose of inspecting veteran support work is to enhance the understanding of cadres and the masses regarding veteran support work, build on existing work achievements, commend successes and advantages, identify shortcomings and problems, and find ways to correct shortcomings and solve problems, to improve and enhance veteran support work. The instructions listed the main content of the inspection, which should include the extent of understanding and importance attached to this work by cadres and the masses, whether it has been regarded as a long-term political task, and whether the production and living problems of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, especially the work of land cultivation on their behalf in rural areas, have been resolved.

Regarding the methods, steps, and timing of the inspection, the instructions also made detailed provisions: First, inspect leadership. People's Governments at all levels should convene or invite the responsible persons of relevant leading organs and people's organizations to conduct the inspection together. Those who have not cared about this work in the past should make self-criticisms, stipulate future implementation methods, and notify subordinate organs to implement them. Second, the heads of People's Governments at all levels must personally take charge and assign certain cadres to form inspection teams to conduct inspections with a focus. In rural areas, the focus should be on townships, and in urban areas, the focus should be on districts and streets, and the masses should be mobilized to conduct a general inspection through veteran support work committees. Those who have not established veteran support work committees should establish them and absorb active elements from the masses to participate in the work. Leading organs above the county (city) level should inspect two or three villages, two or three streets, or a factory or school, to gain experience and promote comprehensive work. During the inspection, small forums, individual visits, and visits to the homes and fields of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers should be used to understand their living and production conditions and listen to their opinions. In rural areas, a competition for land cultivation work on their behalf can be organized. In the process of inspecting the work, it is necessary to prevent the bureaucratic work style of letting things take their own course and the biases of coercive orders and hasty arrangements from occurring. At the same time, counties (cities) should generally convene representative meetings of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment and cultivating land on their behalf around the "August 1st" Army Day, and absorb representatives of the army, relevant departments, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life to participate. Through this representative meeting, promote and implement the veteran support policy and strengthen ideological education on patriotism and resistance to America and aid to Korea.

The instructions concluded: Those who have made achievements in veteran support work and exemplary families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and exemplary disabled revolutionary soldiers should be commended or rewarded in the inspection; those who have shortcomings in veteran support work should be given appropriate criticism and education or appropriate punishment depending on the circumstances. It is also emphatically required that People's Governments at all levels should establish a system of inspecting veteran support work once every three months in conjunction with the inspection of the patriotic convention after this inspection, and regularly include veteran support work as one of the agenda items of the government committee or administrative meeting.

Hebei Provincial People's Government Notifies Various Locations to Organize Cadres to Carry Out Propaganda and Inspection

[This Newspaper's News] The Hebei Provincial People's Government notified all special districts and municipal people's governments on July 15 that a practical inspection of the situation of preferential treatment and pension work should be conducted around the "August 1st" Army Day to carry out a mass veteran support movement. The notice requires people's governments above the county level to immediately organize government cadres to study the five major veteran support regulations issued by the Central People's Government, the Hebei Province Interim Measures for Land Cultivation on Behalf, and relevant documents on the "August 1st" People's Liberation Army Army Day for three days, and then go to villages near the government's station in a planned manner to carry out propaganda and inspection of veteran support work, and create a mass movement of veteran support work. It is also required to focus on inspecting the implementation of land cultivation on behalf.

The Hebei Provincial People's Government has organized a veteran support work inspection team to inspect and promote veteran support work in Baoding City, the suburbs of Baoding City, and Qingyuan County, to further carry out a mass veteran support movement. The inspection team includes cadres and propagandists from the Hebei Provincial People's Government organs, as well as cadres and propagandists from the Baoding Municipal People's Government and Baoding Special District organs, totaling 241 people.

The Party Committee of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, in order to ensure the realization of this inspection task of veteran support work, convened a mobilization meeting of more than 130 publicity committee members and publicity group leaders from all subordinate general branches and branches on July 16.

Henan Provincial People's Government Instructions Require Various Locations to Summarize Experiences and Establish Systems

[This Newspaper's News] The Henan Provincial People's Government issued instructions on inspecting and improving veteran support work on July 18 to welcome the "August 1st" Army Day, requiring various locations to seize this opportunity to go deep into the masses and conduct a general inspection of veteran support work. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize cadres to inspect and, more importantly, to mobilize the masses to inspect. It is necessary to conduct education on loving the army and loving the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers to the masses, in light of local actual conditions, combined with current affairs education and production education, and combine the great significance of the "August 1st" Army Day with the personal interests of the people in turning over, to improve the masses' awareness and make them clearly understand the great role of doing a good job in veteran support work in consolidating national defense and consolidating the army, as well as better improving the social status of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. For families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, it is also necessary to educate and encourage them to produce well and play an exemplary role to maintain and carry forward their glory.

The instructions also called on various locations to summarize the experiences and lessons of past veteran support work and establish a complete and regular veteran support work system, mainly a reporting system and an inspection system.

Shanxi and Chahar Inspect Veteran Support Work; Many Cadres Have Not Yet Regarded Veteran Support Work as a Political Task

[Xinhua News Agency, 14th] Shanxi, Chahar, and other provinces are earnestly inspecting veteran support work. In April and May, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, first organized three land cultivation work inspection teams to conduct key inspections in three types of typical villages, gain experience, and then conduct a general inspection throughout the county. During the inspection, the veteran support committees of each district and village organized inspection committees, absorbing revolutionary martyrs and their families, families of soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and representatives of the masses to participate, and then went to the fields household by household to conduct inspections. Each district and village also held various forums to evaluate good and bad, and used blackboards, radio broadcasts, and various gatherings to commend and criticize. After the general inspection of the county, some districts and villages stipulated a system of regular inspections (once a month in villages), and some villages stipulated that mutual observation and inspection should be organized seasonally. All villages in the county inserted wooden signs in the cultivated land on behalf, stating the names of the cultivator and the family of the soldier, so that the masses could conduct inspections anytime and anywhere. This inspection not only improved the enthusiasm of the cultivators on behalf but also encouraged the families of soldiers to actively participate in production. Changzhi Special District of the province convened a veteran support work conference on May 25, which found that the area had made significant achievements in land cultivation work on behalf, but there were also many problems, such as some departments and cadres had not yet clearly established the idea of doing a good job in land cultivation on behalf for a long time, so they lacked systematic research on land cultivation work on behalf; individual counties were satisfied with the form of land cultivation on behalf and did not check the effect from actual work; and many areas did not form a mass inspection movement when inspecting land cultivation on behalf. The meeting decided to carry out a mass inspection movement of land cultivation work on behalf in the summer and autumn of this year.

The Civil Affairs Department of the Chahar Provincial People's Government convened a meeting of the heads of the civil affairs sections (bureaus) of each special district (city) in mid-June to specifically discuss veteran support work. After the meeting, the Provincial People's Government convened a symposium of the responsible persons of various provincial departments and the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government to inspect veteran support work. The following problems were found at the meeting: First, the leaders in various places have not yet regarded the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment as a long-term political task, so they have not consciously conducted regular supervision and inspection. Some areas simply regard veteran support work as the responsibility of the civil affairs department. Second, there is not enough political respect and economic assistance for the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers. All organs and enterprises have not paid attention to the issue of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers participating in work. Some units even consider it troublesome and often put forward overly high conditions to reject them. In addition, not enough has been done to help their children enter and promote in schools. The Patriotic Convention of the Provincial Health Bureau does not have an item on doing a good job in veteran support work. After the Provincial People's Government and relevant departments discovered the above problems, they made deep self-criticisms and promised to ensure that the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers "have jobs in every household" and "have good land to cultivate in every family"; and ensure that the masses are mobilized to do a good job in veteran support work.

The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, in order to make veteran support work regular, has also specifically stipulated the inspection content of veteran support work according to the seasons such as the Spring Festival, Qingming, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival.

Qu County in Eastern Sichuan and Hongya County in Western Sichuan Correct the Bias in Land Cultivation Work on Behalf

[This Newspaper's News] The vast number of peasants in Qu County, Eastern Sichuan, and Hongya County, Western Sichuan, have received patriotic education in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and actively helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers produce during spring plowing. However, some village cadres, due to a lack of understanding of the political significance of veteran support and land cultivation work on behalf, have had many biases in land cultivation on behalf. For example, individual villages (baos) in Qu County, Eastern Sichuan, turned the land cultivation team into a hard labor team. Li Zixin, director of the Peasant Association of the Seventh Village of Yongxing Township, and others forced landlords, local bullies, hooligans, and lackeys, and even backward peasants who they said did not attend meetings to form a land cultivation team, regarding the land cultivation team as a kind of punishment and control of landlords and local bullies. Not only that, but they also asked the land cultivation team to mainly do work for cadres. The land cultivation team composed of landlords, local bullies, and hooligans in the Fifth Village of Qinglong Township planted rice seedlings for the soldier's family Liu Zhongbi unevenly, which made the soldier's family dissatisfied.

When Liujiang Township in Hongya County, Western Sichuan, began organizing land cultivation teams in the first month of this year, most villages also regarded land cultivation as a punishment and transformation for landlords, surrendered bandits, and hooligans. For example, Hou Guangrong, chairman of the Seventh Branch Peasant Association, said: "The land cultivation team is what these bad people should do, to make them atone for their crimes." Therefore, they were formed into land cultivation teams, and those who had returned from custody were selected as captains, forcing them to cultivate land on behalf of the soldiers' families. As a result, because some did not understand how to grow crops, they damaged the soldiers' families' fields; and when mobilizing the masses to cultivate land on behalf of the soldiers' families, everyone was unwilling to go, thinking that land cultivation was a shame.

In response to the above situation and biases, the Qu County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Eastern Sichuan issued urgent instructions to actively correct them. Liujiang Township in Hongya County, Western Sichuan, also convened a meeting of all village cadres in the township on June 17 to inspect veteran support and land cultivation work on behalf, and made a deep self-criticism and criticism of the above biases, pointing out that this approach was wrong, not only could it not do a good job in land cultivation on behalf, but it also caused very serious losses to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. And in the above places where biases occurred, the peasants were generally educated to love the motherland and love the people's army.

    山东省人民政府规定了检查内容和方法
    【本报讯】山东省人民政府，于七月十六日发出关于检查优抚工作的指示，要求所属各级人民政府在“八一”建军节前后，普遍地切实地进行一次优抚工作大检查。指示指出检查优抚工作的目的，是为了提高干部和群众对优抚工作的认识，在已有的工作基础上，表扬成绩和优点，找出缺点和问题及纠正缺点解决问题的办法，以改进与提高优抚工作。指示列举检查的主要内容应为干部与群众对这一工作的认识与重视程度，是否已把它当作了长期的政治任务，以及烈、军属和革命残废军人的生产与生活问题，特别是农村中的代耕工作，已否获得解决。

    河北省人民政府通知各地组织干部进行宣传和检查
    【本报讯】河北省人民政府于七月十五日通知各专署和市人民政府，于“八一”建军节前后，对优待和抚恤工作状况，要作一次切实的检查，开展群众性的优抚运动。通知要求各地县以上人民政府立即组织机关干部对中央人民政府颁发的五大优抚条例、河北省代耕暂行办法以及有关“八一”人民解放军建军节的文件，进行三天学习，然后有计划地分赴机关驻地附近村庄，进行优抚工作的宣传与检查，把优抚工作造成群众性的运动。并要求着重检查代耕工作执行的情形。
    河北省人民政府已组织了优抚工作检查组，到保定市、保定市郊区和清苑县检查和推动优抚工作，以进一步开展群众性的优抚运动。参加检查组的有河北省人民政府机关干部和宣传员，有保定市人民政府、保定专署机关的干部和宣传员，共二百四十一人。
    中共河北省人民政府党委会，为了保证这次检查优抚工作任务的实现，曾于七月十六日召开了所属各总支部和支部宣传委员、宣传员组长共一百三十多人的动员大会。
    河南省人民政府指示要求各地总结经验建立制度
    【本报讯】河南省人民政府为迎接“八一”建军节，特于七月十八日发出检查与提高优抚工作指示，要求各地抓紧这一时机，深入群众，普遍地对优抚工作进行检查。同时要动员干部检查，更要发动群众检查。要针对当地实际情况，结合时事教育和生产教育，向群众进行爱护军队，爱护烈、军、工属的教育，把“八一”建军节的伟大意义与人民群众翻身的切身利益结合起来，以提高群众觉悟，使其明确认识作好优抚工作，对巩固国防，巩固部队的巨大作用，以及更好地提高烈、军属的社会地位。对于烈、军属、也要教育和鼓励他们好好生产，发挥模范作用，以保持与发扬自己的光荣。
    指示并号召各地总结以往优抚工作的经验教训，建立一套完整的经常的优抚工作制度，主要是汇报制度和检查制度。
    山西察哈尔检查优抚工作不少干部还没有把优抚工作当作政治任务
    【新华社十四日讯】山西、察哈尔等省认真检查优抚工作。山西省武乡县于四、五两月中，首先组织了三个代耕工作检查组，分别在三种类型的典型村进行重点检查，取得经验，然后在全县普遍进行大检查。检查时，各区、村的优抚委员会都组织了检查委员会，吸收革命烈士和军人家属、革命残废军人和群众代表参加，然后逐户深入田间进行检查。各区、村并召开各种座谈会，评比好坏，利用黑板报、广播筒及各种集会进行表扬和批评。全县大检查后，有的区、村即规定了按期检查制度（村每月一次），有些村规定按季节组织相互观摩和检查。全县各村在代耕地里插上木牌，写明代耕人与军人家属的姓名，便于群众随时随地进行检查。这次检查不仅提高了代耕户的积极性，也鼓舞了军人家属积极参加生产的热情。该省长治专署于五月二十五日召开了优抚工作会议，发现该地区代耕工作有显著成绩，但也存在不少问题，如某些部门与干部还没有明确树立长期作好代耕工作的思想，因此对代耕工作缺乏系统的研究；个别县满足代耕形式，不从实际工作中去检查效果；很多地区在检查代耕时，未形成群众性的检查运动。会议决定要在今年夏、秋两季对代耕工作开展群众性的检查运动。
    察哈尔省人民政府民政厅于六月中旬曾召开各专署（市）民政科（局）长会议，专门讨论优抚工作。会议结束后，该省人民政府又召开了省级各部门和张家口市人民政府负责人的座谈会，对优抚工作进行了检查。在会上发现如下问题：一、各地领导思想上还没有把拥军优抚工作当做长期的政治任务，因此，没有自觉地经常进行督促检查。有些地区把优抚工作单纯认为是民政部门的事。二、对革命烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人在政治上的尊重和在经济上的扶助都不够。各机关、企业都没有重视革命烈士和军人家属和革命残废军人参加工作的问题，有的单位甚至认为麻烦，常常提出过高的条件来拒绝他们。另外，帮助他们的子弟入学升学也做得不够。省卫生局的爱国公约中，就没有做好优抚工作这一项。该省人民政府和有关部门发现了上述问题后，都作了深刻的检讨，并保证今后要使革命烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人“户户有职业”，“家家地种好”；保证把群众动员起来，做好优抚工作。
    平原省人民政府为使优抚工作经常化，也已按春节、清明、端阳、中秋等季节，具体规定出了优抚工作的检查内容。
    川东渠县和川西洪雅县纠正代耕工作的偏向
    【本报讯】川东渠县和川西洪雅县的广大农民在抗美援朝运动中，接受了爱国主义的教育，在春耕中积极帮助烈军属生产。但有些村的干部，由于不了解优属代耕工作的政治意义，所以在代耕中发生不少偏向。如川东渠县有个别村（保）把代耕队搞成了苦工队。涌兴乡七村农民协会主任李自新等强迫地主、恶霸、二流子、狗腿子，甚至于他们所谓开会不到的落后农民组成代耕队，把代耕队当作是一种处罚和管制地主、恶霸的组织，不但如此，并且叫代耕队主要给干部作活路。青龙乡第五村以地主、恶霸、二流子参加的代耕队，给军属刘中碧插秧时稀密不匀，使军属不满。
    川西洪雅柳江乡在今年正月开始组织代耕队时，大部分村也把代耕看成是对地主、自新土匪和二流子等等的一种处罚和改造。如七分会农民协会主席侯光荣说：“代耕队是该这些坏人干的，要他们戴罪立功。”因此把他们编成了代耕队，并把管训回来的选为队长，强迫他们替军属代耕。结果，因为有些不懂种庄稼，反把军属的田做坏了；并且动员群众去替军属代耕时，大家都不愿去，认为代耕是耻辱的事。
    针对以上情况和偏向，中共川东渠县委员会发出紧急指示，积极纠正。川西洪雅柳江乡也于六月十七日召开了全乡各村干部会，检查了优抚代耕工作，对以上偏向作了深刻检讨与批评，指出了这种作法是不对的，不但作不好代耕工作，反而给烈属、军属造成很严重的损失。并在以上发生偏向的地方，对农民普遍进行热爱祖国，热爱人民军队的教育。
