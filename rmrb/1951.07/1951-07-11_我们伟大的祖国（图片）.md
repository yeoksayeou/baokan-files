    Our Great Motherland
    The Central People's Government has implemented a correct ethnic policy, changing the discrimination, oppression, and division among ethnic groups during the Kuomintang rule.

This is a scene of a get-together held by the Mongolian and Han people of Maoming An Banner in Suiyuan during last year's Mid-Autumn Festival.
