Reader's Letter

    I have begun to pay attention to grammar study
    Editor:
    In the past, I did not study grammar in middle school or university. At the same time, I had the mistaken idea that the beauty of the mother tongue lay in its lack of grammar.

    Since reading the People's Daily editorial, "Correctly Use the Mother Tongue and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language!" and Mr. Lü and Mr. Zhu's "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric," I have corrected my mistaken understanding of the mother tongue. At the same time, I realized that "correctly using language to express thoughts has great political significance in all the work led by the Communist Party today." Only by correctly using the mother tongue can "ideas be correctly grasped by the masses, and can correct material strength be produced."

    For example, in the second lecture, third paragraph, on word meaning, in Mr. Lü and Mr. Zhu’s "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric," they point out that word meanings contain commendatory and derogatory senses. When describing the same thing, two people with different positions can have different ways of saying it. Many words look similar, but some have a sense of praise, and some have a sense of depreciation. The boundaries are clear and should not be confused. Using them incorrectly can lead to big jokes or serious mistakes. They cited many grammatical errors that had appeared in newspapers and magazines. Some of these mistakes were ones I had made or seen before. Before they were pointed out, I did not understand that they were mistakes, or I knew they were wrong, but I did not know where the mistake lay. Now that I have studied them, I have begun to pay attention to this issue.

    In order to correctly use the mother tongue and correct the confusion in language, we must work hard to learn to correctly use the mother tongue, and Mr. Lü and Mr. Zhu's "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" is of great help to our learning.

### 我开始注意了语法学习

    我开始注意了语法学习编辑同志：
    过去，我在中学和大学没有学习过语法，同时，对祖国语言有一种“妙就妙在没有文法”的错误看法。
    自从读了人民日报《正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争！》的社论，和吕、朱两先生的《语法、修辞讲话》后，纠正了我对祖国语言的错误认识，同时了解到“正确地运用语言来表现思想，在今天在共产党所领导的各项工作中具有重大的政治意义”。也只有正确地使用了祖国的语言，才能使“思想为群众所正确地掌握，才能产生正确的物质力量”。
    例如吕、朱二先生《语法、修辞讲话》第二讲第三段词义中指出：词义含褒贬。叙述同一件事，两个人的立场不同，说法也就可以不同。有很多词看来很相像，可是有的带赞许的意味，有的带贬斥的意味，界限分明，不容混淆。用错了，就可能闹很大的笑话，或者犯很大的错误。他们举出了许多曾经出现在报纸杂志上的使用语法的错误。而这些错误有的是自己曾经犯过或看到过的，未经指出前，还不明白是错误，或者知道不对，但不知道错在那里。现在，我学习了以后，已开始注意了这个问题。
    为了正确地运用祖国语言，纠正语言上的混乱现象，我们一定要下苦工夫来学习正确地运用祖国语言，而吕、朱二先生的《语法、修辞讲话》，对我们的这种学习，有很大的帮助。
