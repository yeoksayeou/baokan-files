Grammar and Rhetoric Talk
    Lü Shuxiang Zhu Dexi
    Section 2: Word Collocation

    We often say "improper use of words." A word, if not newly coined, is inherently neither "proper" nor "improper." The issue of "proper" or "improper" only arises when it is placed in a specific context. For instance, in the sentence "The heroic posture of the People's Air Force soared in the skies of the motherland for the first time," "heroic posture" is clearly inappropriate because "heroic posture" cannot "soar." Similarly, in "Isn't this thing more ruthless than a bomb?" "Ruthless" is also inappropriate because a "bomb" is not a person and cannot be described as "ruthless." The errors in these two examples are obvious: there is no connection between "heroic posture" and "soaring," or "bomb" and "ruthless"; putting them together is like "a donkey's head on a horse's body."

    Another situation is, for example, "discuss in connection with self-criticism" and "stand firm on our position, master our profession, and serve the people." These sentences are not wrong in meaning, but they sound awkward because we usually say "combine with self-criticism," not "connect with self-criticism," and "stand firm on our position" and "do a good job in our profession," not "stand well on our position" and "get through our profession." This kind of problem can be called "putting a hat on the wrong head."

    To avoid errors in word usage, one must not only understand the meaning of each word, but also pay attention to which words it usually collocates with. When constructing sentences, carefully check whether the related words are appropriately matched and whether they conform to usage. Below, we will cite some examples of errors:

    Predicate not corresponding to the subject:

    (1) His age is already old. (Incorrect)
    (2) Even this number is too much. (Translated)
    (3) The process of the Korean People's Army transitioning from defensive warfare to counteroffensive was very fast. (Periodical)
    (4) In these areas, the disaster situation began to decline. (Book)
    (5) The imperialists' delusion that the Chinese liberation war, although victorious, faced insurmountable financial and economic difficulties has shamefully failed. (Periodical)

    In (1), "age" does not correspond to "old." We only say that a person is "old" or that their age is "high." In (2), "number" can only be "large" or "small," not "much" or "little." In (3), "process" can only be "long" or "short," not "fast" or "slow." In (4), "decline" and "rise" refer to quantities, such as "temperature decline" and "cost of living rise." "Disaster situation" cannot be measured in quantity, so we can only say "improved," not "declined." In (5), "delusion" cannot be "successful" or "failed." "Failed" should be changed to "unfulfilled."

    (6) The impression given to young people is good and profound. (Periodical)
    (7) The reason the church itself encountered difficulties was mainly because some Chinese and Western missionaries were too conservative, too narrow, and too stubborn. (Periodical)

    In (6), the predicate contains two coordinate items: "good" and "profound." "Good" matches the subject "impression," but "profound" does not. It should be changed to "deep." In (7), "narrow" is a word opposite to "broad" and cannot be applied to people. It should be changed to "narrow-minded."

    (8) The illness has not fully recovered. (Letter)
    (9) Using mechanical tea production can not only increase the mountain price of rough tea and the accumulation of funds, but also make the products quick and uniform. (Report)
    (10) Under the call of the Ministry of Railways, road maintenance work has also been universally improved. (Periodical)
    (11) But Chiang Kai-shek's situation in Taiwan is becoming increasingly insecure. (Periodical)

    In (8), "illness" and "recover" do not match. What "recovers" is the "body," not the "illness." In (9), "products" matches "uniform," but not "quick." It should be changed to "and can ship goods quickly and with uniform quality." In (10), it should be "the efficiency of road maintenance work has also been universally improved." In (11), "situation" should be changed to "position."

    Verb not corresponding to the object. This is what Mr. Ye Shengtao called "a way of saying like 'drink rice'" (People's Daily, 1950, 5, 24). There are extremely many of these examples; here, we can only select a few as representatives.

    (12) Now the comrades have all put forward their determination: to temper themselves into steel fighters in difficult and arduous environments. (Periodical)
    (13) We are recovering the wounds of war. (Letter)
    (14) In short, in southern Jiangsu, the landlord class committed a lot of this kind of sinful blood debt. (Periodical)
    (15) The Chinese people have been liberated, and they have pointed out an example for the people of other colonies and vassal states. (Report)
    (16) Overcome various difficulties to build this dilapidated and long-unrepaired salt field. (Periodical)
    (17) Many valuable opinions were put forward in the review, which further prompted our understanding of this issue. (Book)
    (18) I am willing to sacrifice my studies, go to society to serve, to remedy the temporary difficulties of the family. (Letter)
    (19) It has been of great help to actual revolutionary work. (Periodical)

    In (12), "determination" can only be "expressed," not "put forward." In (13), "recover" has the meaning of "restore." When a disease is cured, we only say "health has recovered," not "the disease has recovered." "Recover" in this sentence can be changed to "heal." (Also, the "wound" in "wounds of war" should be "创" (chuàng) instead of "疮"(chuāng)). In (14), "commit" should be changed to "owe." (Also, "blood debt" is of course "sinful," so the word "sinful" is unnecessary.) In (15), we can say "set an example" or "make an example," but we cannot say "point out an example." In (16), saying "build a dilapidated and long-unrepaired salt field" inevitably confuses people. We say "build a new China" or "transform old China," but we never say "build old China." Here, "build" should also be changed to "transform." In (17), the object of "prompt" must have a second verb to express the object's behavior, such as "prompt the early realization of this plan." This sentence should be changed to "improve our understanding of this issue" or "enable us to gain a further understanding of this issue." In (18), "difficulties" cannot be "remedied." It should be said "help the family overcome temporary difficulties." In (19), "has been" should be changed to "is." We only say "play a role," not "play help."

    (20) So I was elected as a member of the student union and took on the responsibility of the women's department. (Periodical)
    (21) The workers of Malaya have taken up their arms again and are carrying out guerrilla activities in the countryside and jungles. (Periodical)
    (22) The number of women participating in leadership positions in government agencies at all levels is in the tens of millions. (Periodical)
    (23) Exercise the body, improve politics, and cultivate collectivist thought. (Periodical)

    In (20), changing "take on" to "shoulder" or "bear" would allow it to be used with "responsibility." Otherwise, "responsibility" must be changed to "work." In (21), "arms" cannot be "taken up." What can be "taken up" are "weapons." (Also, "guerrilla activities" is better said as "guerrilla warfare.") In (22), it should be said "women participating in leadership work." (Also, "in the tens of millions" is used as "in the thousands, in the tens of thousands," which is classical Chinese and easily misunderstood as being counted in "tens of millions.") In (23), it should be said "improve political understanding."

    (24) Save unnecessary expenses and waste as much as possible. (Periodical)
    (25) Improve the needs of agricultural production and farmers' lives. (Periodical)
    (26) The reason they won the award is not only because they completed and exceeded their production responsibilities. (Periodical)

    The previous two examples are both one verb governing two objects. In (24), "save" and "expenses" are correct, but "save" does not match "waste." One can only say "reduce waste." In (25), "needs" should be changed to "level." In (26), two verbs govern one object, but we can neither say "complete responsibilities" nor "exceed responsibilities." Changing "responsibilities" to "tasks" can be paired with "complete," but "exceeded tasks" is still incorrect. It should be said "overfulfilled the task."

    Generally, the object of a sentence is placed after the verb, but in sentences with the word "把" (bǎ), the object is moved forward. In sentences with the word "被" (bèi), the original object is moved to the front to become the subject, but in meaning, it should still be governed by the verb (see Section 4 of the first talk, "Complex Predicates"). Therefore, we will also discuss these two types of sentences here:

    (27) In many places, bandit troubles have been eradicated or mostly suppressed. (Periodical)
    (28) When the motherland's safety is threatened and invaded, I am willing to shed my last drop of blood. (Manuscript)
    (29) The phenomenon of abortion, infanticide, and selling children is not only prohibited in law... (Periodical)
    (30) Mobilize everyone to completely sweep away the unclean places in the factory. (Manuscript)

    In (27), "bandits" can be "suppressed," but "bandit troubles" cannot be "suppressed." It is better to still use "eradicated." (Also, "mostly" should be moved in front of the word "被" (bèi).) In (28), "safety" can be "threatened," but it cannot be "invaded." Removing "safety" and changing "被" (bèi) to "受到" (shòudào), meaning "subjected to," would make it grammatically correct. In (29), "phenomenon" cannot be "prohibited." It should be changed to "behavior." In (30), "扫除" (sǎochú) and "打扫" (dǎsǎo) have similar meanings, but different usages. We say "sweep away garbage," not "clean garbage"; we say "clean a place," but not "sweep away a place." Here, it should be said "...completely cleaned."

    (31) As for why they are entering school and who they are studying for, these basic understandings are not clear. (Work)
    (32) The reactionary government has never dredged or repaired the Yangtze River. (Periodical)

    In (31), the word "弄" (nòng) is a verb with a passive meaning. "Basic understanding" is the subject in form, but in meaning, it is governed by "弄" (nòng). In (32), although "dredging and repairing" has been transformed into a noun, "Yangtze River" is still governed by it. These can be said to be "notional objects." Taking (31) as an example, we can say "understanding is not clear," but we cannot say "understanding is not clear (弄)," because "understanding" cannot be "弄" (nòng, meaning "make" or "do"). "Understanding" should be changed to "issue." In (32), we can repair a "house" or a "factory," but we cannot repair a "Yangtze River." In fact, this word is superfluous; it is enough to just say "dredge." (Also, "毫无" (háowú, meaning "not at all") should be changed to "从未" (cóngwèi, meaning "never").)

    Predicate Complement not corresponding to the subject:

    (33) The classroom has become the only time we study. (Work)
    (34) Teaching students in ordinary universities to become graduates who are immediately unemployed is a phenomenon. (Work)

    A "classroom" is a concrete thing, so how can it become "time"? "Students" will also not become a "phenomenon." These types of examples have more to do with logic and less to do with vocabulary. We will not discuss them much here and will leave them for the fifth talk.

    Attributive Modifier not corresponding to the noun:

    (35) Because they are neither landlords nor farmers, they believe they have no direct interest in land reform. This is only an extremely superficial illusion. (Report)
    (36) Such a wrong phenomenon actually appeared at this evaluation meeting. (Work)
    (37) The revolutionary red flag then advanced southward along with their arduous footprints. (Periodical)
    (38) When the working people organize themselves, they have broad and wide conditions. (Periodical)

    In (35), "illusion" is an unreal feeling. Since it is unreal, what distinction is there between "profound" and "superficial"? "Illusion" should be changed to "thinking." In (36), "phenomenon" is neither "correct" nor "wrong." Here, one can only say "bad phenomenon." In (37), "arduous" and "footprints" have no meaning when placed together. In (38), "conditions" are abstract concepts, so how can they be "broad" and "wide"? The meaning of this sentence is probably "After the working people organize themselves, they will have a bright future."

    (39) It proves that the South Korean puppet is corrupt and decayed, and cannot withstand a single blow. (Periodical)
    (40) Only in this way can new problems be seen, and the work can have a new start. (Periodical)

    In example (39), using "corrupt" to describe "decayed" is unfathomable. Only one of these two adjectives needs to be used. ("Corrupt" is best changed to "corrupt," and "decayed" is also better as "decadent.") In (40), saying "have a new start," does that mean there was a "old start" before? The word "new" is superfluous.

    (41) The reactionaries use countless despicable means to persecute us. (Work)
    (42) Public and private letters and reports issued from this point of view have caused many excitement and hope among church groups at home and abroad. (Periodical)

    "Means," "excitement," and "hope" cannot be counted, so the quantitative adjectives "countless" or "many" cannot be added in front. "Countless" in (41) can be changed to "various," and "many" in (42) can be changed to "great," but the verb "cause" does not match the objects "excitement" and "hope." It should be changed to "give... great excitement and hope."

    (43) If you earn easy money, you might as well spend it freely. (Periodical)
   "Easy" is an attributive of the verb "earn". Now it is misplaced and has become an attributive of "money". "Easy money" has no meaning, and it should be "money that is easy to earn".

    Adverbial Modifier not corresponding to the verb:

    (44) When it was about to be mealtime, the students automatically crowded in the corridor in front of the dining hall. (Work)
    (45) As long as you think deeply about the relations of production, this "planned capitalism" argument is extremely hypocritical and ridiculous. (Periodical)
    (46) The boundaries between cities and villages, between intellectual and physical labor, are increasingly and thoroughly eliminated. (Periodical)
    (47) The newspapers, publications, and broadcasts controlled by American capitalists tell them one hundred percent that revolution is only about killing and arson and has no benefits. (Report)
    (48) This excellent style should be well learned by us. (Report)

    In (44), one can only say "automatic" when consciously doing something with positive significance, such as "automatically publicizing to everyone" or "automatically lining up to buy tickets." "Crowding" is not something with positive significance and cannot be said to be "automatic." In (45), "slightly" contradicts "think deeply." "Think deeply" should be changed to "think." (The tone of this sentence is also inconsistent. Before "this," words like "one would know" or "one would discover" should be added.) Example (46) says "increasingly and thoroughly eliminate," which indicates that it had not been "thoroughly eliminated" before, which is self-contradictory. One can only say "gradually eliminate." In (47), "one hundred percent" can only be a noun modifier, not a verb modifier. ("Revolution is only killing and arson" should be changed to "Revolution is killing and arson.") In (48), "very well" can only be a noun modifier. The corresponding verb modifier is "properly," such as "study properly, work properly."

　　语法、修辞讲话
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
    第二段  词的配合
    我们常说“用词不当”。一个词如果不是生造出来的，它本身是无所谓“当”与“不当”的，只有把它放在特定的上下文里，才发生“当”或“不当”的问题。譬如“人民空军的雄姿第一次在祖国的天空飞翔”，“雄姿”显然用得不恰当，因为“雄姿”是不会“飞翔”的。再如“这不是比炸弹还狠心的东西么？”“狠心”也不恰当，因为“炸弹”不是人，不能说“狠心”。这两个例子的错误是很明显的，“雄姿”和“飞翔”，“炸弹”和“狠心”之间毫无瓜葛，放在一起是“驴头不对马嘴”。
    还有一种情形，例如“连系自我批评进行讨论”，“站好立场，搞通业务，为人民服务”，这两句话意思并没错，但是读起来很蹩扭，因为通常不说“连系自我批评”，只说“结合自我批评”，不说“站好立场”“搞通业务”，只说“站稳立场”“搞好业务”，这种毛病可以叫做“张冠李戴”。
    要避免用词的错误，不仅要了解每个词的意义，还要注意它常跟哪些词配合。造句的时候，要仔细检查相关的词配得是否适当，合不合习惯。下面我们举些错误的例子来看：
    谓语与主语不相应：
    （一）他的年龄已经老了。（作）
    （二）即是这个数目也嫌太多。（译）
    （三）朝鲜共和国军队由防御战转入反攻的过程非常快。（期）
    （四）在这些地方灾情开始下降。（书）
    （五）帝国主义者认为中国的解放战争虽然胜利、但是财政经济的困难是无法克服的这种妄想，是可耻的失败了。（期）
    （一）的“年龄”跟“老”不相应。我们只说人“老”，或者说年龄“大”。（二）“数目”只能说“大”“小”，不能说“多”“少”。（三）“过程”只有“长”“短”，无所谓“快”“慢”。（四）“下降”“上升”都是指数量说的，例如“温度下降”“生活指数上升”，“灾情”不能以数量计，只能说“好转”，不能说“下降”。（五）“妄想”无所谓“成功”或“失败”，“失败”应该改为“落空”。
    （六）给青年的印象是良好而又深厚的。（期）
    （七）教会本身招致困难的原因，主要是由于一些传教的中西人士太保守，太狭义，太顽固。（期）（六）的谓语包含等立的两项——“良好”和“深厚”，“良好”跟主语“印象”配得拢，“深厚”却不行，应改为“深刻”。（七）的“狭义”是与“广义”相对的词，不能安在人身上，应改为“狭隘”。
    （八）病状一直没完全康复。（信）
    （九）利用机械制茶，不但可以提高毛茶山价和资金的累积，并可使出品迅速整齐。（报）
    （十）在铁道部号召之下，养路工作也普遍提高了。（期）
    （十一）但是蒋介石在台湾的情况愈来愈不保险了。（期）（八）“病状”和“康复”配不拢，没有“康复”的是“身体”，不是“病状”。（九）“出品”跟“整齐”配得拢，跟“迅速”却配不拢，应该改为“并且可以出货迅速，品质整齐”。（十）应该说“养路工作的效率也普遍提高了”。（十一）“情况”应改“地位”。
    动词与宾语不相应。这就是叶圣陶先生所说“类乎‘喝饭’的说法”（人民日报，一九五○，五，二四）。这类例子多极了，这里只能挑选少数做代表。
    （十二）现在同志们都已提出自己的决心：要在艰难困苦的环境中，锻炼自己成为钢铁战士。（期）
    （十三）我们正在恢复战争的疮伤。（信）
    （十四）总之，在苏南，地主阶级制造像这一类的罪恶血债多得很。（期）
    （十五）中国的人民解放了，他们为其他殖民地人民和附庸国人民指出了榜样。（报）
    （十六）克服各种困难，来建设这破破烂烂长久失修的盐场。（期）
    （十七）检讨中曾提出不少宝贵意见，更促使我们对这一问题的认识。（书）
    （十八）我愿牺牲我的学习，去到社会上服务，来补救家庭这一时的困难。（信）
    （十九）对实际革命工作起了很大的帮助。（期）（十二）“决心”只能“表示”，不能“提出”。（十三）“恢复”有“还原”的意思，病好了，我们只说“健康恢复了”，不说“病恢复了”。本句的“恢复”可以改为“医治”。（又“疮伤”的“疮”应作“创”。）（十四）的“制造”应改为“欠下”。（又“血债”当然是“罪恶”的，“罪恶”二字没有必要。）（十五）可以说“树立榜样”“做出榜样”，不能说“指出榜样”。（十六）说“建设破破烂烂长久失修的盐场”，不免叫人胡涂，我们说“建设新中国”，或者说“改造旧中国”，却从不说“建设旧中国”，这里的“建设”也应该改为“改造”。（十七）的“促使”的宾语后头必须有第二个动词表示宾语的行为，例如“促使这个计划早日实现”。这句应改为“提高我们对这个问题的认识”或“使我们对这问题获得进一步的认识”。（十八）“困难”不能“补救”，应该说“帮助家庭克服暂时的困难”。（十九）的“起了”应改为“有”。我们只说“起作用”，不说“起帮助”。
    （二十）于是被选为学生会的委员，担任妇女部的责任了。（期）
    （二一）马来亚的工人重新拿起了他们的武装，在农村和丛林中进行游击队活动。（期）
    （二二）各级政府机关中参加领导地位的妇女那就以千万计。（期）
    （二三）锻炼身体，提高政治，培养集体主义思想。（期）（二十）的“担任”改做“担负”或“负起”就可以跟“责任”连用。否则就要把“责任”改做“工作”。（二一）“武装”是不能“拿起”的，能够“拿起”的是“武器”。（又“游击队活动”不如说“游击”。（二二）应该说“参加领导工作的妇女”。（又“以千万计”作“以千计，以万计”讲，是文言，容易让人误会是以“千万”计。）（二三）应该说“提高政治认识”。
    （二四）尽可能的节省不必要的开支和浪费。（期）
    （二五）提高农业生产与农民生活的需要。（期）
    （二六）他们得奖的原因，不只是因为他们完成了和超过了自己的生产上的责任。（期）前两个例子都是一个动词管两个宾语。（二四）“节省”“开支”是不错的，但是“节省”跟“浪费”却配不拢，只能说“减少浪费”。（二五）“需要”应改为“水准”。（二六）是两个动词管一个宾语，但是我们既不能说“完成责任”，也不能说“超过责任”。把“责任”改做“任务”，和“完成”可以配合，但是“超过了任务”还是不行。应该说“超额完成了任务”。
    一般句子的宾语是放在动词后面的，但在有“把”字的句子里，宾语提前了。在有“被”字的句子里，又把原来的宾语提到前面来做主语，但是在意义上它仍然应该受动词的管辖（参看第一讲第四段“复杂的谓语”一节）。所以我们把这两类句子也放在这里讨论：
    （二七）许多地方匪患已经肃清或被大部剿灭。（期）
    （二八）当祖国安全被威胁和侵略时，我愿流尽自己最后一滴血。（稿）
    （二九）打胎溺婴卖儿鬻女的现象，不仅在法律上被禁止…………（期）
    （三十）动员全体把厂内不清洁的地方完全扫除。（稿）（二七）“匪”可以“剿灭”，“匪患”却不能“剿灭”，不如仍用“肃清”。（又“大部”应挪在“被”字前面。）（二八）“安全”可以“被威胁”，可不能“被侵略”。把“安全”删去，把“被”改成“受到”，就通了。（二九）“现象”不能“禁止”，应改为“行为”。（三十）“扫除”跟“打扫”意思相近，用法却不一样。我们说“扫除垃圾”，不说“打扫垃圾”；说“打扫某一个地方”，却不说“扫除某一个地方”。这里应该说“…………完全打扫干净”。
    （三一）对于为什么进学校，为什么人读书，这些基本认识都弄不清楚。（作）
    （三二）反动政府对长江毫无疏浚与修建。（期）（三一）的“弄”字是被动意义的动词，“基本认识”在形式上是主语，但是在意义上受“弄”的管辖。（三二）的“疏浚与修建”虽然已经转成名词，但是“长江”还是受它的管辖。这些可以说是“意念上的宾语”。拿（三一）来说，我们可以说“认识不清楚”，却不能说“认识弄不清楚”，因为“认识”是不能“弄”的，“认识”应改为“问题”。（三二）我们可以修建一座“房屋”，一所“工厂”，却不能修建一条“长江”，其实这个词是多余的，光说“疏浚”就行了。（又“毫无”应改“从未”。）
    表语与主语不相应：
    （三三）教室成了我们唯一学习的时间。（作）
    （三四）把一般大学里的学生教得都成了毕业即失业的现象。（作）“教室”是具体的东西，怎么会变成“时间”？“学生”也不会成为“现象”。这类例子跟逻辑的关系多，跟词汇的关系少，这里就不多说，留在第五讲里讨论。
    附加语与名词不相应：
    （三五）因为自己既非地主又非农人而认为自己就和土地改革没有直接利害关系，这只是一种极肤浅的错觉。（报）
    （三六）在这次评议会上竟出现了这种错误的现象。（作）
    （三七）革命的红旗便随着他们艰苦的足迹南进。（期）
    （三八）劳动人民自己组织起来，便有了广大与宽阔的条件。（期）（三五）“错觉”就是不真实的感觉，既然不真实了，还有什么“深刻”与“肤浅”的分别呢？“错觉”应改为“想法”。（三六）“现象”无所谓“正确”与“错误”，这里只能说“坏现象”。（三七）“艰苦”与“足迹”放在一块儿没有意义。（三八）“条件”是抽象的概念，怎么会“广大”“宽阔”呢？本句的意思恐怕是说“劳动人民组织起来以后，便有了远大的前途”。
    （三九）证明了南朝鲜傀儡是腐蚀的枯朽，不堪一击。（期）
    （四十）这才能看出新的问题，工作才能有新的起色。（期）（三九）例用“腐蚀”来形容“枯朽”猜不透是什么意思，这两个形容词，只要用一个就够了。（“腐蚀”最好改为“腐败”，“枯朽”也不如“腐朽”。）（四十）说“有新的起色”，是不是以前有过“旧的起色”呢？“新的”这两个字是多余的。
    （四一）反动派以无数卑鄙的手段来迫害我们。（作）
    （四二）由这种观点发出的公私函件和报告，使国内外的教会团体发生不少兴奋和希望。（期）“手段”“兴奋”“希望”都是无从计数的，所以前面不能加“无数”或“不少”等数量形容词。（四一）的“无数”可以改为“种种”，（四二）的“不少”可以改为“极大的”，但是动词“发生”跟宾语“兴奋”和“希望”都配不拢，应该改为“给予……以极大的兴奋和希望”。
    （四三）赚了容易的钱就不妨放手花。（期）
    “容易”是动词“赚”的附加语，现在放错了地位，就变成了“钱”的附加语了，“容易的钱”是没有意义的，应说“容易赚来的钱”。
    附加语与动词不相应：
    （四四）快要吃饭的时候，同学们便自动地挤在饭厅前面的走廊上。（作）
    （四五）只要稍微就生产关系上深思一下，这种“计划资本主义”的说法，是极虚伪可笑的。（期）
    （四六）城市和乡村之间，智力和体力劳动之间的界限愈来愈彻底地消灭。（期）
    （四七）美国资本家控制着的报纸，刊物，广播，百分之百的告诉他们革命只有杀人放火，别无好处。（报）
    （四八）这种优良作风是我们应该很好学习的。（报）（四四）自觉地去做一件有积极意义的事，才能说“自动”，例如“自动向大家宣传”“自动排队买票”，“挤”不是一件有积极意义的事，不能说“自动”。（四五）的“稍微”跟“深思”矛盾。“深思”应改为“想”。（这句话语气也不连贯，“这种”前面应加“就知道”“就会发现”一类的话。）（四六）例说“愈来愈彻底地消灭”，这正表示以前并没有“彻底消灭”，岂非自相矛盾？只能说“逐渐消灭”。（四七）“百分之百”只能做名词附加语，不能做动词附加语。（“革命只有杀人放火”应改为“革命就是杀人放火”。）（四八）“很好”只能做名词附加语，跟它相当的动词附加语是“好好”，例如“好好学习，好好工作”。
                         （本段完，全文未完）
