　　Invading Soldiers from the United States, Britain, and Other Countries in Korea
　　Hope for an Armistice to Return Home Soon
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th] This reporter's conversations over the past few days with journalists from the United States, Britain, and other countries who came to Kaesong, as well as with some American officers and soldiers, have shown that soldiers from the United States, Britain, and other countries in Korea are eagerly hoping for the success of the peace talks. Most of these journalists also expressed the same wish. Even a journalist from the most reactionary American magazine could not help but admit: The issue that the American people are most concerned about regarding the current world situation is the cessation of the Korean War. He also said: The American people all hope to obtain an armistice agreement. In this way, American soldiers can go home. A journalist who recently visited the British troops at the front line said: British soldiers, like soldiers from other countries, hope to stop fighting. He also said: British soldiers believe that the three principles for peaceful resolution of the Korean issue proposed by General Nam Il are "generally acceptable." Two journalists from Western European countries sitting next to this journalist also scrambled to say that the soldiers in their countries also urgently hoped for peace. One of the journalists raised his glass and said: Let us drink to world peace. An American army officer, seeing this situation, said that it would be good if the conference room was as harmonious as the outside. Another American army officer, when talking about the three peace principles proposed by General Nam Il, said: "If both sides act accordingly, that would be great, and we can go home for Christmas." Then, he said: "We receive letters from home every day, and every letter hopes that we will return home soon." American soldiers are even more eager to go home. Several American drivers, when talking to this reporter, took out photos of their families and said: We miss our parents very much. We all hope that the war will end quickly so that we can return home and reunite with our families as soon as possible.
    However, this peaceful wish of the American and British soldiers is often not sympathized with by the American generals. A recent typical example is: The notice given by General Kim Il Sung and General Peng Dehuai to Ridgway on the 14th of this month, which was warmly welcomed by American and British soldiers (in which they agreed to designate the Kaesong area as a neutral zone during the conference and provided convenience to the American side on the issue of journalists, thus restoring the negotiations that had been interrupted by the American side), was actually ordered by the American military authorities to be prohibited from being disseminated to its troops. American military officers said: The superiors ordered that the news about the communist broadcast accepting General Ridgway's conditions must not be disseminated to the troops. They themselves did not know why they were not allowed to tell the frontline troops this good news.

　　侵朝美英等国士兵
　  盼望停战好早回家
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社记者在过去几天中与前来开城的美英等国记者和美方的一些军官和士兵交谈的结果，表明了在朝鲜的美英等国的士兵们迫切地希望和平谈判成功。这些记者中的大多数人也表示同一个愿望。连最反动的美国一家杂志的记者也不能不承认：美国人民对当前世界局势最关心的是停止朝鲜战争的问题。他并说：美国人民都希望能够获得停战协议。这样，美国兵就可以回家去。一个最近才访问了前线英军的记者说：英国士兵和其他国家的士兵一样都希望停止打下去，他并且说：英国士兵们认为，南日将军提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的三点原则“一般地说是可以接受的”。坐在这个记者旁边的两个西欧国家的记者也抢着说，他们国家的士兵也是迫切希望和平。其中一个记者并举杯说：让我们为世界和平而干杯。一个美国陆军军官看见这种情形后说，会议室里面也是像会外这样和谐就好了。又有一个美国陆军军官在谈到南日将军提出的三点和平原则时说：“如果双方都照着办，那太好了，我们就可以回家过圣诞节了。”接着，他又说：“我们每天都接着家里的信，每封信都希望我们快些回家去。”美军士兵们更是迫切地希望回家。几个美国司机在与本社记者谈话时掏出自己家人的照片说：我们很想念父母。我们都希望战争迅速停止，可以早日回家和家人们团聚。
    但是美英军士兵的这种和平愿望，却常常不是美国的将军们所同情的。最近一个典型的例证是：受到美英军士兵热烈欢迎的金日成将军和彭德怀将军在本月十四日给李奇微的通知（其中同意将开城地区划为在会议进行期间的中立区，并在新闻记者问题上给美方便利，因此恢复了被美方所中断的谈判），竟被美军当局下令禁止向它的部队传布。美军军官们说：上级下令，关于共产党广播接受李奇微将军条件的消息，不得向部队传布。他们自己也不知道为什么不让前线部队知道这个好消息。
