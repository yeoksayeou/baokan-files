They believe that this is another atrocity committed by US aircraft during the Korean armistice talks, once again exposing the aggressive nature of US imperialism. All the students felt extremely excited about the People's Air Force's deserved punishment of the US aircraft that invaded our Northeast airspace. Yang Shilu, a sophomore in the Department of Electrical Engineering, said: "The US aircraft invading Korea were shot down by us seven at once, and the remaining one was left to go back and report the bad news." Yang Ningzu, a sophomore in the Department of Electrical Engineering, said: "The United States is always bragging about how powerful its F94 jet fighters are, but in front of the Chinese People's Air Force, they appear very insignificant!"
