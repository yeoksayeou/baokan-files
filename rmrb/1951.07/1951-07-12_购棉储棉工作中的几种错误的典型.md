Several Typical Mistakes in Cotton Procurement and Storage

Some cadres followed behind backward cotton farmers, neglecting political education and market management

　　The responsible cadres of the Xinxiang Special Commissioner's Office personally inspected the cotton procurement and storage work in Xinxiang, Huojia, and Xiuwu counties. Generally speaking, the leaders of each county have paid attention to this work, convened various economic departments for research, and formulated work plans. They are now preparing to convene enlarged cadre meetings and meetings of cotton farmer representatives and activists to implement the plans in a comprehensive manner, which is excellent. However, some problems in the work of the above three counties should be given close attention. It is understood that after the news of cotton procurement was released, due to the poor quality of our propaganda and education work, some comrades did not provide complete and comprehensive explanations of the policy in their propaganda. They simply and one-sidedly stated that the country was facing difficulties and needed to purchase cotton. This instead made some cotton farmers believe that cotton was precious and they became even more reluctant to sell it. A merchant who returned from Shanghai in Huojia told the masses: "The yarn factories there have stopped working due to a shortage of cotton." Some cotton farmers who heard this said: "We must preserve the cotton well and sell it when the price is good." According to a survey, several cotton farmers in Qiliying stored 36,000 jin of cotton, and only 600 jin were stored in the bank after repeated mobilization. One household in Kangcun had 1,200 jin of cotton, but only admitted to having 20 jin. This shows that cotton farmers have little understanding of the relationship between the individual and the country, and the consistency between individual interests and national interests. Some leading cadres also lack an overall view, one-sidedly emphasizing the temporary economic interests of farmers, ignoring the long-term interests of the country and farmers, and not understanding the list price policy or studying the laws of price fluctuations. They followed behind the backward thinking of the farmers, also shouting "list prices are low, market prices are high." Although there is currently a gap between list and market prices in a few markets, it is only about 300 yuan, equivalent to about five liang of wheat. As long as we strengthen market management, we can strive for balance. If we follow suit and raise prices, private merchants will inevitably raise them further, which will inevitably cause price fluctuations and market chaos, which will be detrimental to cotton farmers and will still not solve the problem of the difference between list and market prices.

　　Based on the above situation, leading comrades at all levels must educate cadres well, correct tailism, and quickly strengthen propaganda and education work for farmers, improve farmers' patriotic enthusiasm and political consciousness, and enable farmers to combine personal interests with national interests.

Many cadres in Luoyang Prefecture were blindly optimistic, completing less than 5% of the task in half a month

　　The cotton procurement and storage campaign in various counties of Luoyang Prefecture, Henan Province, did not achieve the due results due to insufficient assessment of difficulties and relaxed leadership. Many cadres initially believed that since the task of mobilizing people to join the army had been completed, what difficulties could there be! Activists among the masses also generally reflected that selling and storing cotton not only provided sufficient prices from the government but was also a glorious act of patriotism. They believed that with just one call from the government, it could be completed quickly! The estimate of cotton storage in each county was based only on extrapolating from one township or one district to the entire county, without ascertaining the actual amount of cotton stored in each county. During the concrete implementation, only general calls and arrangements were made, without proper propaganda, and the concerns of the masses could not be dispelled in a timely manner. It was not recognized that the liberation had not been long, the awareness and understanding of the masses were not high, and there were many concerns such as fear of "standing out," fear of having their class status raised, fear of being called rich, and fear of additional "donations." Currently, cotton is infested with aphids, and there is even more fear that they will not be able to deliver the pre-purchased cotton in the autumn. None of these concerns were foreseen in advance, resulting in serious difficulties in the procurement and storage work, hindering the development of the campaign. Luoyang County, because it did not ascertain the amount of cotton stored, allowed township cadres to challenge and self-report when distributing tasks to individual districts. Some township cadres, without considering the actual situation, reported inflated numbers, and there was no way to return to the township, so they distributed the tasks to the villages, and the villages divided them equally among the households. As a result, households without cotton had to buy cotton for sale and storage. In addition, some private merchants took advantage of the situation and raised cotton prices. The administrative departments of industry and commerce neglected market management, resulting in the price of cotton, which was originally 9,600 yuan per jin, rising to 14,000 yuan, causing chaos in the cotton market.

　　Due to the above reasons, half a month after the task was assigned on June 7, the number completed in the entire region was less than 5% of the planned task. At present, various counties in the prefecture urgently need to correct this blind optimism and the bias of not facing up to difficult conditions, otherwise the work cannot move forward.

One-sided propaganda focusing on the immediate interests of farmers led the cotton procurement and storage work astray

　　In the cotton procurement and storage work carried out by the working group of the Shanzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Daying Township, Shan County, Henan Province, because they did not politically inspire farmers' patriotic enthusiasm and only one-sidedly promoted the economic benefits of cotton procurement and storage methods for cotton farmers, it had the opposite effect and caused the work to take a detour. The process was as follows: When the working group first arrived in the township, the masses were busy with wheat harvesting. Everyone went separately to understand the cotton storage situation and held small forums for individual propaganda. However, in the propaganda, they did not grasp the principle of politically raising farmers' awareness, but simply helped farmers calculate economic accounts, publicizing how selling and storing cotton would benefit them. The farmers' understanding was not improved, so they speculated. Some people thought that cotton had become a treasure, a rare commodity, and became even more secretive. Even some township cadres couldn't understand it, feeling that cotton was scarce now, grain prices would fall after the wheat harvest, and the state called for selling cotton, "which is just making the masses suffer." When the working group held a forum for middle peasants in a village, only seven out of more than twenty middle peasant households attended. Generally, rich peasants cried poor to everyone they met. A young Communist Youth League member reported the amount of cotton stored at home and was blamed by his father when he returned home.

　　Afterwards, the working group studied this lesson and decided to convene representative meetings, mass meetings, and various forums to systematically publicize why the government called for selling and storing cotton, and what benefits selling cotton to the state would bring to supporting the resistance against the US and aid to Korea, to the worker brothers, to people of all strata, and to the cotton farmers themselves. At the same time, the specific methods of selling and storing cotton were explained, eliminating some cotton farmers' misunderstandings. At various meetings, attention was paid to inspiring cotton farmers to recall the past, look at the present, and think about the future, to recognize the relationship between farmers and the country. As a result, the masses generally reflected: "The price is high enough, and in many years, one jin of cotton has not been worth ten jin of wheat." "For the sake of resisting the US and aiding Korea, I will not keep even an ounce of cotton." Then, a heat wave of selling and storing patriotic cotton was launched. From June 16th to 18th, in three days, more than 10,000 jin of cotton were sold (plus some seed cotton).

　　Through this movement, the working group has initially gained the following two experiences:

　　First, launching the cotton sales and storage campaign must be combined with patriotic ideological education of resisting the US and aiding Korea, so that the masses understand that this is a patriotic action. We cannot one-sidedly publicize what immediate economic benefits selling cotton has for farmers. Experience has proven that when the masses understand the political significance of selling and storing cotton, their patriotic enthusiasm for selling cotton will be promoted.

　　Second, we must deeply publicize and implement the production policy to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, especially the rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, such as fear of showing wealth, fear of reinvestigation, fear of struggle or having their class status raised, fear of increasing the burden, and fear of future adjustment of the fruits of the struggle.

　　购棉储棉工作中的几种错误的典型
  有些干部做了落后棉农尾巴不注意政治教育和市场管理
    新乡专署负责干部曾亲往新乡、获嘉、修武等县检查了购棉储棉工作。一般说，各县领导上均已注意这个工作，召集各经济部门作了研究，订出工作计划，现正准备召开扩大干部会议与棉农代表积极分子会议，采取大发动方式往下贯彻，这是很好的。但以上三个县工作中有些问题还应十分注意。据了解，在购棉消息传出后，由于我们的宣传教育工作差，有的同志宣传中不是完整的全面的解释政策，仅简单片面地说国家困难，要购棉花，反使部分棉农认为棉花是宝，越发珍藏不售。获嘉有从上海回来的商人告群众说：“那里纱厂因缺少棉花停了工。”有的棉农听了就说：“这可得把棉花保存好，等好价钱再卖。”据调查七里营几户棉农就存棉三万六千斤，再三动员仅储存到银行六百斤；亢村一户有棉一千二百斤，只承认有二十斤。这说明棉农对个人与国家关系，个人利益与国家利益的一致性还没有什么认识。有些领导干部也缺乏整体观念，片面强调农民暂时的经济利益，忽视国家与农民的长远利益，不了解牌价政策也不研究物价规律，做了农民落后思想的尾巴，也在喊叫“牌价低、市价高”。目前少数市场虽牌市价相差，但也不过差三百元上下，合麦子不过五两左右，只要我们加强市场管理，是可以争取平衡的。如果我们跟着提价，私商势必再提，这样必然会引起物价波动，市场混乱，对棉农不利，仍解决不了牌市价的差额问题。
    根据以上情况，各级领导同志必须很好地教育干部，纠正尾巴主义思想，并迅速加强对农民的宣传教育工作，提高农民爱国热情与政治觉悟。使农民将个人利益和国家利益结合起来。

  洛阳专区许多干部盲目乐观半月完成任务不到百分之五
    河南洛阳专区各县的购棉储棉运动，由于对困难估计不足，放松领导，致未获得应有的成绩。许多干部在开始时，都认为动员参军任务都完成啦，这还有啥困难！群众中积极分子也普遍反映说：售棉储棉政府不但付给足够价钱，而且是光荣爱国，只用政府一号召，很快就可以完成啦！各县对存棉数量估计，只以一乡或一区推算整个县，究竟每县存棉数字多大则不摸底。具体进行时，只一般地作了号召布置，没有很好地展开宣传，不能及时解除群众顾虑。没认识到解放时间不长，群众觉悟和认识还不高，怕“冒尖”，怕提高成份，怕说富，怕加派“捐项”等各种顾虑很多。目前棉花生了蚜虫，更怕秋后缴不了预购棉花。对这一些顾虑，事前都没有预见到；结果使购储工作遇到了严重困难，障碍了运动开展。洛阳县因为对存棉数字不摸底，个别区向下布置时，让乡干部挑战自报，有的乡干部不根据实际情况，多报了数，回乡没办法，就把任务分配到村，村里又均摊到户。结果没棉户还得买棉售储；又加之有些私商投机取巧，高抬棉价。工商行政上忽视了市场管理，以致原来九千六百元一斤的棉花现在提高到一万四千元，闹得棉市很乱。
    因为以上原因，所以自六月七日任务布置后半月时间，全区完成数字不及预定任务百分之五。目前该专区各县亟应纠正此种盲目乐观、不正视困难条件的偏向，否则工作无法前进。（河南日报）
        片面宣传对农民的眼前利益大营购棉储棉工作走了弯路
    中共河南省陕州地委工作组在陕县大营乡进行购棉储棉工作中，因为没有从政治上启发农民爱国热情，只片面宣传购棉储棉办法中对棉农经济利益的照顾，曾经起了相反的作用，使工作走了一段弯路。经过是这样：工作组初到该乡时，群众正忙于麦收。大家便分头个别了解存棉情况，并召开小型座谈会，进行个别宣传。但在宣传中没有掌握从政治上提高农民觉悟的方针，而是单纯帮助农民算经济账，宣传售棉储棉如何如何对自己有利。农民认识没有提高，于是纷纷揣测。有一部分人以为棉花成了宝物，奇货可居，越发深藏不露。甚至有的乡干部也想不通，觉得现在棉缺，麦后粮价要跌，国家号召售棉，“反正是叫群众吃亏”。工作组在一个闾召开中农座谈会时，二十多户中农只到了七户。一般富农则逢人便哭穷。有一个青年团员报了家中存棉，回家就受到他父亲的责备。
    以后工作组研究了这个教训，决定召开代表会、群众会、各种座谈会，系统地宣传政府为什么要号召售棉储棉，将棉售给国家对支援抗美援朝、对工人弟兄、对各阶层人民以及棉农自己有那些好处。同时也讲解售棉储棉的具体办法，消除了若干棉农的误会。在各种会议上注意启发棉农回忆过去，看看现在，想想前途，认识农民与国家的关系。这样做的结果，群众普遍反映：“价钱是顶够了，多少年也没有一斤棉花能顶十斤麦。”“为了抗美援朝，我一两花也不留了。”接着就掀起了售储爱国棉花的热潮。六月十六日到十八日，三天时间，即售出棉花一万余斤（另有籽花一部）。
    经过这段运动，该工作组初步体会到以下两点经验：
    第一，发动售棉储棉运动，必须结合抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育，使群众了解这是一种爱国行动。不能片面地宣传售棉对农民有那些眼前的经济利益。经验证明，当群众了解了售棉储棉的政治意义后，爱国售棉的热情是会发扬起来的。
    第二、必须深入地宣传与贯彻生产政策，解除群众、特别是富农与富裕中农的思想顾虑，比如怕露富、怕复查、怕斗争或提高成份、怕加重负担、怕将来调整斗争果实等。
