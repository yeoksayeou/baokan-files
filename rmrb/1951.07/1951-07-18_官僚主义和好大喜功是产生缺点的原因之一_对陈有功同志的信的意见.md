　　Bureaucratism and the Desire for Greatness are Among the Reasons for Shortcomings – Opinions on Comrade Chen Yougong's Letter

　　In the past year, many serious shortcomings have occurred continuously in basic construction work, causing huge losses. The reasons for this lie in the leading cadres, especially the leading cadres of enterprises, and include the following:

　　Some leading cadres in enterprises believe that they are only in charge of policies, and do not need to ask too much about specific projects. According to my understanding, many leading cadres do not have a firm grasp of the progress of the projects in their units; even when they find that the construction is sloppy and does not meet the standards during the completion and acceptance of the project, they do not seriously investigate, eventually leading to tragic incidents that injure people's lives and property. This extremely serious bureaucratic style must be overcome urgently.

　　We are carrying out huge and complex basic construction work under the existing conditions, which is certainly difficult, and some mistakes are inevitable. However, Comrade Chen Yougong's opinions unilaterally emphasize objective difficulties. If we do not try to overcome difficulties, they will always remain difficulties; if we do not expose errors and correct them, errors will continue to occur. We should affirm that the past basic construction has been successful, but we cannot say that because there has been general success, certain shortcomings should not be exposed, and we can excuse our errors by saying that the organization of the enterprise has just been established and economic accounting has not been implemented.

　　“The budget and final accounts are extremely untimely – especially the budget issue, which has been submitted for a long time without approval.” The enterprise itself must also bear certain responsibility for this problem. For example, has the budget been prepared with detailed calculations? Many "budgets" are prepared to cope with the superior and the fund-receiving agencies, so what is submitted is one thing, and what is used in the project is another, and the budget is constantly changing. In this way, the budget approval agency cannot but conduct investigation and research. As far as I know, one construction unit had three budgets for building a warehouse last year, and the unit itself could not figure out which one to use as the standard. In such a situation, can we only blame the superior for "submitting the report and not approving it for a long time"? Secondly, "serious tasks are also placed on our heads, whether to carry out basic construction or not," the so-called "serious tasks" are related to some enterprise leaders' own expansion of construction tasks. These comrades did not make a correct assessment of their own construction capabilities and were eager for greatness and success. The construction tasks originally assigned by the superiors were enough to do, but they themselves increased the construction tasks. As a result, the so-called "serious tasks" could not be completed well.

### 官僚主义和好大喜功是产生缺点的原因之一  ——对陈有功同志的信的意见

　　官僚主义和好大喜功是产生缺点的原因之一
    ——对陈有功同志的信的意见
    一年来基本建设工作中，连续地发生了不少严重的缺点，造成巨大的损失。其原因在领导干部，特别是企业领导干部方面有以下几点：
    有一些企业中的领导干部，认为自己只是掌握政策的，具体的工程可以不必多问。据我的了解，有不少领导干部对于该单位的工程进行情况，掌握得不紧；甚至在工程完竣验收时，发现建筑草率，不合标准，也不认真追究，最后造成损伤人民生命财产的惨痛事件。这种十分严重的官僚主义作风，亟待克服。
    我们在现有的条件下进行巨大而繁复的基本建设工作，是有一定困难的，也难免不发生某些错误。但是，陈有功同志的意见，单方面的强调了客观困难。如不设法克服困难，则永远是困难；不把错误揭露，并加以纠正，错误将会不断地发生。我们应当肯定，过去的基本建设是有成绩的，但不能因为一般说有成绩，即便有某些缺点也不应揭露了，便可借口企业的组织刚刚建立及没有实行经济核算等来原谅自己的错误。
    “预算决算极不及时——特别是预算问题，报了上去，好久不批”，这个问题在企业本身也要负一定的责任。譬如说，预算的编制，是否经过详细的计算？有不少的“预算”是为应付上级与领款机关而编制的，因之报上去的是一套，工程上使用的又是一套，而且预算随时变更。这样，批审预算的机关就不能不作调查研究。据我知道的，有一个建设单位，去年建造仓库预算就有三个，倒底以那一个为准，该单位自己也搞不清楚。这样的情形，能只怪上级“报了上去，好久不批”吗？其次是：“严重的任务又压在头上，基本建设干是不干”，所谓“严重的任务”有些是与某些企业领导干部自己扩大建设任务有关的。这些同志对于自己的建设能力没有作一个正确的估计，好大喜功，原来上级交下的建设任务已经够做了，自己又增加建设任务，其结果，所谓“严重的任务”就不能很好的完成。
