　　Improving Technology and Refining Operational Methods
　　Making Labor Competitions a Regular Practice
　　The Dong Fusheng group of the smelting workshop of the Kunming Electrical Equipment Factory learned from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group, paying attention to improving the technology of the entire group and refining operational methods, thus making competition a regular practice. Most of the workers in the Dong Fusheng group were apprentices and farmers who had just come from the countryside. In view of this situation, when the Dong Fusheng group challenged the Ma Hengchang group, they made improving the technology of the entire group the main content of participating in the competition. They formed mutual aid groups of three with veteran workers and new workers, as well as masters and apprentices. After each smelting, they held meetings to review and study the reasons for the extension or shortening of the smelting time. Because veteran technicians frequently taught new workers and apprentices operating techniques, and technical personnel also frequently explained technical principles, the operating skills of the new workers rapidly improved, and apprentices learned all kinds of operating methods within the second period during the first period.
　　Due to the general improvement of the technical level of the entire group, the smelting operation technology of the group was continuously improved. In March, the group researched and developed a method to enlarge the flue of the furnace, and modified the fixed ventilation gate of the furnace into a movable gate, so as to control the switch of the gate in a timely manner to accelerate the melting and oxidation process. At the same time, they improved techniques such as adding coal, reducing the smelting time per furnace from fifty hours to thirty-six hours and fifty-five minutes. As a result, production efficiency in March increased by 44 percent, exceeding the task specified in the contract by 10.3 percent. In April, in the production competition to welcome "May Day," in addition to specifically defining the operating procedures for the size of the gate opening to avoid improper control, the group also shortened the oxidation-reduction process by adding firewood in advance, further shortening the smelting time to an average of twenty hours, with a minimum of eighteen hours and twenty minutes, creating the newest record since the factory was founded. At the end of April, the group further demonstrated a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm, using hot patching to repair the top of the furnace and the side door of the furnace, extending the life of eight furnaces, thereby overfulfilling the production task.
　　The Dong Fusheng group put forward more than ten rationalization proposals in one month, and told the entire workshop about the group's experience, so that the products of the entire smelting workshop could be continuously improved and the cost continuously reduced.

### 昆明电工器材厂董福生小组  提高技术改进操作法  劳动竞赛走向经常化

　　昆明电工器材厂董福生小组
　  提高技术改进操作法
　  劳动竞赛走向经常化
    昆明电工器材厂冶炼车间董福生小组学习马恒昌小组先进经验，注意提高全组技术、改进操作方法，使竞赛经常化。董福生小组中的工人大部分是学徒和刚从农村出来不久的农民。针对这个情况，董福生小组向马恒昌小组应战时，就以提高全组技术作为参加竞赛的主要内容。他们把新老工人和师傅学徒分别组成三人互助小组，每次冶炼以后都开会检讨，研究冶炼时间延长或缩短的原因。由于老技工经常向新工人和学徒教授操作技术，技术人员也经常讲解技术原理，新工人的操作技术迅速提高，学徒在第一期就学会了第二期内各种操作方法。
    由于全组技术水平普遍提高，该组冶炼操作技术不断改进。三月份，该组研究出放大炼炉烟道的方法，并将炼炉的固定通风闸门改装成活动闸门，以便适时控制闸门开关，加速熔化和氧化过程，同时改进了加煤等技术，使每炉冶炼时间由五十小时缩减到三十六小时五十五分。因而三月份生产效率提高了百分之四十四，超额百分之十点三完成了合同规定的任务。四月份，在迎接“五一”的生产竞赛中，该组除具体定出闸门开度大小的操作规程以避免控制失当外，又用提前加柴的办法缩短了氧化还原过程，使冶炼时间进一步缩短到平均二十小时，最低十八时二十分，创造了该厂建厂以来的最新纪录。四月底，该组更发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热情，用热补的办法抢修了炉顶和炉子侧门，延长了八炉寿命，因而超额完成了生产任务。
    董福生小组在一个月的时间内共提出了十多件合理化建议，并把本组经验告诉全车间，使全冶炼车间的产品得以不断提高，成本不断降低。
