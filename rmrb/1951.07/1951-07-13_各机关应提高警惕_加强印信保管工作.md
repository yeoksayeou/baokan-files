　　All Agencies Should Heighten Vigilance and Strengthen the Work of Seal Keeping
    In the past five months, our Xijiao Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has handled five cases of forging documents. For example, in January, we investigated and arrested illegal element Ding Lixin at the Mingji Inn in Xizhimen. His social connections were very complicated. When he went to Tongxian Town Government to find his brother Ding Guangzhou (a cadre of the town government), he was allowed to stay overnight in the construction section office of the town government; and the bed he slept on was right next to the table where the seals were kept. So, he stole six blank slips and stamped them with the section's seal. On June 27, we arrested another forger of certificates without household registration, He Juefei, at the same inn. In the spring of 1950, when he worked at the Yongding River Spring Works Committee and the Flood Control Headquarters, he stole two blank slips from each place and stamped them with the official seals; recently, he used these blank slips to forge two retirement certificates in an attempt to deceive and cheat his way into a job at a construction company.
    These incidents show that some of our agency cadres, especially those responsible for keeping seals, are still very careless in their thinking. Their careless work style gives bad people an opportunity to exploit loopholes, which is very dangerous. We hope that comrades in charge of keeping seals in every unit will heighten their vigilance and strengthen the work of keeping seals, so as to avoid unnecessary losses to the country.

### 各机关应提高警惕  加强印信保管工作

　　各机关应提高警惕
　  加强印信保管工作
    我们北京市公安局西郊分局在最近五个月中，处理了伪造证件案五起。如一月间，我们在西直门明记小旅店中查获不法分子丁立信，他的社会关系非常复杂。他到通县镇政府找他哥哥丁广洲（镇政府干部）时，夜晚竟被留宿在镇政府建设科办公室内；而他睡的床铺刚好靠着放印信的桌子。于是，他就偷拿空白条子六张，盖上该科印信。六月二十七日，我们在这家旅店里又查获一个没有户籍的伪造证件犯何觉非。一九五○年春，他在永定河春工委员会及防汛指挥部工作时，偷拿该两处的两张空白条，盖上公章；最近即用这空白条假造了两张退职证明，企图蒙混欺骗，投考建筑公司。
    这些事件说明我们有些机关干部，特别是负责保管印信的同志，思想还是很麻痹的。他们这种疏忽大意的工作作风，就会让坏人有钻空子的机会；这是很危险的事情。希望每个单位保管印信的同志提高警惕，加强保管印信工作，以免使国家受到不应有的损失。
