　　Iran Announces Nationalization of Oil Industry
    Broad Masses of People Demand Thorough Implementation

    [News Agency Report] According to Xinhua News Agency: The negotiations between the Iranian government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) regarding the Iranian oil issue, held in Tehran from June 14th to 19th, have broken down because the British representatives refused to acknowledge the Iranian oil nationalization laws.

    At the start of the negotiations, the Iranian government representatives demanded that the AIOC acknowledge the Iranian oil nationalization laws and hand over 75% of the company's income since the passage of the nationalization law to the Iranian government. The remaining 25% would be deposited in a bank agreed upon by both parties. The Iranian government demanded that the AIOC acknowledge these conditions before further negotiations could proceed.

    On the 19th, the AIOC representatives put forward a counter-proposal, stating that the AIOC was willing to pay the Iranian government 10 million pounds sterling during the negotiation period, but the basis for the agreement should be the establishment of a new company by the AIOC, allowing the Iranian government to send several representatives to participate in the company's board of directors. The aim of the British representatives' proposal was to exploit Iran's financial difficulties, using the upfront payment of 10 million pounds sterling to reject the implementation of the Iranian oil nationalization law. On the 19th, after the Iranian government representatives rejected this proposal, considering it to be in conflict with the Iranian oil nationalization law, the British representatives withdrew from the meeting, and the negotiations thus broke down.

    The American Ambassador to Iran, Grady, actively interfered in these negotiations. During the negotiations, he visited Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh several times. On the 19th, before the final negotiation took place, Grady again visited Mossadegh, urging him not to take "rash actions" so that "this huge industry can continue to be used by Western countries." He also urged the Iranian government to quickly decide on accepting American loans.

    Under the unified demand of the Iranian people, the Iranian cabinet decided on the 20th to immediately take over all facilities of the AIOC and announced that "the AIOC no longer exists." Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh said during his conversation with Grady on the 19th: "Public sentiment is running high throughout the country, opposing any delay in taking over the oil facilities."

    [News Agency Report] According to Xinhua News Agency: After the negotiations between the Iranian government and the AIOC regarding the Iranian oil issue broke down on June 19th, the Iranian government immediately ordered the implementation of the oil nationalization law on the 21st. On the 21st, the Iranian national flag was raised on the roof of the former AIOC headquarters. The company's sign has been replaced by the sign of the temporary board of directors of the "Iranian National Oil Company." The company's signs in various cities have also been removed.

    The people of Tehran support the government's measure. On the evening of the 21st, about 30,000 people held a rally in front of the Iranian Parliament building. Speakers denounced the attitude taken by the former AIOC during the negotiations and demanded that the government fully implement the oil nationalization law and quickly take over the former AIOC's enterprises. The resolution passed by the conference stated: The Iranian people support the Mossadegh government's decision to implement the oil nationalization law and to take over all of the AIOC's enterprises.

　　伊朗宣布石油工业国有化
    广大人民要求彻底执行
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：伊朗政府和英伊石油公司于六月十四日至十九日在德黑兰举行的关于伊朗石油问题的谈判，由于英方代表拒绝承认伊朗的石油国有化法律，业已宣告破裂。
    伊朗政府代表在谈判开始时，要求英伊石油公司承认伊朗石油国有化法律，并把该公司自国有化法通过以后的收入的百分之七十五，交给伊朗政府。其余的百分之二十五存入双方同意的银行。伊朗政府要求英伊石油公司承认这些条件后，再进行谈判。
    英伊石油公司的代表于十九日提出一反建议，表示英伊石油公司愿意在谈判期间先付给伊朗政府一千万英镑，但双方协议的基础则应是由英伊石油公司成立一新公司，允许伊朗政府派遣若干代表参加该公司的董事会。英方代表这一建议的目的，是企图利用伊朗的财政困难，以先付一千万英镑的手段，拒绝伊朗石油国有化法的实行。十九日，在伊朗政府代表拒绝这一建议，认为它与伊朗石油国有化法相抵触后，英方代表即退出会场，谈判因而破裂。
    美国驻伊大使格拉第积极地干涉了这一次的谈判。他在谈判进行期间，曾数度访问伊朗首相摩萨台。十九日，在最后一次谈判举行之前，格拉第又访问摩萨台，要他不要采取“轻率的行动”，以便使“这个巨大的工业可以继续留给西方国家使用”。他同时要求伊朗政府从速决定接受美国的贷款问题。
    在伊朗全国人民的一致要求下，伊朗内阁已于二十日决定立即接收英伊石油公司的一切设备，并宣布“英伊石油公司已不存在”。伊首相摩萨台十九日在和格拉第谈话时说：“全国各地群情激昂，反对在接收石油设备方面有任何推延。”
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：伊朗政府和英伊石油公司关于伊朗石油问题的谈判于六月十九日破裂后，伊朗政府即于二十一日下令立即着手实施石油国有化法。二十一日，前英伊石油公司总办事处房顶上已升起了伊朗国旗。该公司的招牌已被“伊朗国营石油公司”临时董事会的招牌所代替。该公司在各城市的招牌也已被撤除。
    德黑兰的人民拥护政府的这一措施。二十一日傍晚，约有三万人在德黑兰国会大厦的门前举行大会。演说者痛斥前英伊石油公司在谈判期间所采取的态度，并要求政府充分实施石油国有化法，迅速接收前英伊石油公司的企业。大会通过的决议表示：伊朗人民支持摩萨台政府实施石油国有化法和把英伊石油公司的企业全部接收的决定。
