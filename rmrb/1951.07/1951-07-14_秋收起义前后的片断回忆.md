　　Fragmentary Recollections Before and After the Autumn Harvest Uprising
　　Liu Xing
　　From 1925 to 1927, the Northern Expeditionary Army expanded to the Yangtze River basin. At this time, the people of the whole country, especially the broad masses of workers and peasants, were extremely enthusiastic about the revolution and demanded that the revolution continue to deepen and expand. However, the imperialist, feudal and comprador forces tried their best to undermine the revolution, attempting to subvert the revolutionary forces and maintain and consolidate their counter-revolutionary rule. In the first half of 1927, on the one hand, the political situation changed very dangerously. A series of counter-revolutionary incidents occurred: Chiang Kai-shek massacred workers in Ganzhou and Nanchang in mid-March, massacred the people in Anqing in late March, and then massacred workers and revolutionary people on a large scale in Shanghai on April 12th and 13th, openly announcing the "purification" of the Communist Party, completely exposing his counter-revolutionary true colors. But on the other hand, the revolutionary forces also continued to expand and deepen: the Wuhan revolutionary forces continued to extend northward, and the peasant movement in the southern provinces (mainly Hunan) was surging, opposing local tyrants and evil gentry, establishing rural peasant revolutionary regimes, and beginning to demand the distribution of land. Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Report on the Investigation of the Hunan Peasant Movement": "The rise of the peasant movement at present is an extremely important issue. In a very short period of time, hundreds of millions of peasants will rise up from the central, southern and northern provinces of China, with a momentum like a storm, swift and abnormal, and no great force will be able to suppress it. They will break through all the nets that bind them and run swiftly towards the road of liberation. All imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry will be finally buried in their graves by them. All revolutionary parties and revolutionary comrades will be tested and decided upon by them. Will they stand at the head and lead them? Or will they stand behind and criticize them? Or will they stand on the opposite side and oppose them? Every Chinese has the freedom to choose from these three, but the situation will force you to choose quickly."
　　The mutiny of the Changsha warlord Xu Kexiang on May 21 (the "Ma-Ri Incident") was a tragic page in the history of the counter-revolutionary forces' attack on the Hunan revolutionary forces! Due to the opportunist errors of the revolutionary leaders at that time, the revolutionary forces suffered significant losses. Subsequently, the "June 5th Incident" occurred in Pingxiang, and the revolutionary forces in Liling and Pingxiang retreated to Anyuan (i.e., the Pingxiang mining area). Following the Xuzhou Conference of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary group, the Wuhan government betrayed the revolution. Our Party convened the "August 7th" Conference, corrected Chen Duxiu's opportunist leadership line, reorganized the leading components of the Party Central Committee, and decided on the correct line of adhering to and deepening the revolution. Simultaneously with the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising, the Party Central Committee sent Chairman Mao to Hunan to lead the peasant Autumn Harvest Uprising in order to restore and maintain the revolutionary base. This was an important turning point in the Chinese revolution from the First Domestic Revolutionary War to the Second Domestic Revolutionary War.
　　After the Wuhan coup, Comrade Lu Deming (regimental commander) led the 2nd Army's Guard Regiment (which had more than 200 Anyuan workers, including more than a dozen Party members, led by Comrade Gao Zili, and after arriving in Wuchang, was organized into a company, with Comrade Wu Zhonghao as the company commander) and sailed down the river from Wuchang on July 31. Halfway there, upon learning of the Nanchang Uprising and that Jiujiang was blocked, preventing passage, they landed at Huangsangkou in Yangxin and entered Yangxin County, intending to go to Nanchang via Wuning and Jing'an to join forces. When the troops reached Fengxin, they learned that Comrades Zhu De, He Long, Ye Ting, etc., had led their troops through eastern Jiangxi and Fujian to advance to Dongjiang. At that time, the reactionary troops of the 3rd, 6th, and 9th Armies were stationed on both sides of the Gan River, preventing passage. The Party then decided to secretly send Comrade Lu Deming to Nanchang to inquire about news, while the troops retreated to Xiushui (the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces) for training, and temporarily used the Provisional 1st Division of the Jiangxi Provincial Defense Army as a temporary designation to gain a buffer opportunity, strengthen forces, rectify the troops, and then decide on action after understanding the enemy's situation. Soon, peasant self-defense forces from Pingjiang and Liuyang and peasant self-defense forces from Chongyang and Tongcheng in Hubei arrived successively, and were organized into the 3rd Regiment and sent to Tonggu for training. At this time, Chairman Mao, under the order of the Party Central Committee, came to lead the troops' actions (Comrade Lu Deming also came), supporting the peasant struggle, defeating the offensive of the counter-revolutionary forces, restoring the revolutionary base, and deeply launching armed struggle for the revolution. At that time, the Party's plan was to achieve the following tasks: (1) The revolutionary Communist Party should completely break away from the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang and distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; (2) Organize a workers' and peasants' revolutionary army; (3) Confiscate the land and property of landlords and distribute them to poor peasants; (4) Overthrow the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary regime and establish a revolutionary regime led by the Communist Party; (5) Organize a congress of workers, peasants and soldiers. This is the purpose of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in the history of the Chinese revolution.
　　In order to lead the Autumn Harvest Revolutionary struggle, Chairman Mao traveled between the miners of Anyuan and the peasant self-defense forces in Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Liling. At that time, the counter-revolutionary arrogance was fierce, and revolutionary workers, peasants, and young students were captured everywhere. Anyone with the slightest "red" suspicion was shot. On one occasion, Chairman Mao (who was not known to the counter-revolutionaries) was detained by the reactionary "militia" in Wenjiashi, Liuyang. When Chairman Mao was not far from being escorted to Liuyang County, he cleverly escaped and hid in a pond with deep grass. At this time, the militia soldiers were searching for him everywhere and forced the nearby peasants to search for him. The searchers came near him several times, but they finally did not find him, and they had to stop searching until nightfall. Chairman Mao climbed mountains and ridges and walked all night. He had no shoes, and his feet were beaten up. After the care of the revolutionary peasants along the way (the peasants also did not know who he was), he bought an umbrella, a pair of shoes, and some food, and passed through the northern section of the Luoxiao Mountains before safely arriving in the revolutionary army. At that time, when Chairman Mao arrived at the troops, he had only two copper coins left on his body.
　　After Chairman Mao arrived at the troops, in the capacity of secretary of the Front Enemy Committee, he convened a Party meeting and decided to form the 1st Army of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army, with Lu Deming as the army commander. The workers of Anyuan and the peasant self-defense forces of Pingxiang and Liling were organized into the 2nd Regiment, with Wang Xingya as the regimental commander, as the left wing, to attack Pingxiang (which was not taken due to its strong defenses) and Liling (which was taken), and then to concentrate on Liuyang. The Guard Regiment from Wuchang was reorganized into the 1st Regiment, and the remnants of Xia Douyin's troops who had been defeated after attacking Wuhan (wandering in the E'nan area) were incorporated into the 4th Regiment, to jointly attack Pingjiang, as the right wing. The 3rd Regiment, formed by the peasant self-defense forces, first attacked Baisha City in eastern Liuyang, and planned to join forces with the 2nd Regiment on the 12th to capture Liuyang. After success on all fronts, it was planned to attack Changsha on the 15th, with hundreds of armed comrades and thousands of workers in the city serving as internal support. Unexpectedly, when the 1st and 4th Regiments attacked Pingjiang, the 4th Regiment mutinied and colluded with the reactionary troops to attack our 1st Regiment, resulting in the failure of the attack on Pingjiang. Upon hearing the news, the 3rd Regiment stopped attacking Liuyang. When the Liuyang reactionary troops heard that our army had been defeated in Pingjiang, they attacked our 3rd Regiment in Baisha City. Our army suffered some losses and withdrew from Baisha City, gathering and reorganizing between Liuyang and Wanzai after meeting the 1st Regiment. The 2nd Regiment, due to not understanding the situation, attacked Liuyang according to the original plan, and was ambushed outside the east gate, falling into an encirclement. Backed by the city and facing the water, most of them heroically sacrificed, and a few escaped. The plan to attack Changsha thus failed.
　　Chairman Mao then decided to abandon the policy of occupying central cities and turn to the Jinggangshan area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi to establish a revolutionary base. After the 1st and 3rd Regiments joined forces, Chairman Mao convened a meeting of the troops, using a high degree of revolutionary determination and confidence to encourage everyone, cheer up, and continue to advance along the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, fighting to establish a revolutionary regime in the central section of the Luoxiao Mountains. Therefore, the troops immediately proceeded according to the plan. But after passing through Tongmu and Xiaojian, and reaching Luxi, they were ambushed by the reactionary army of Jiang Baoding's battalion. Because our army was unaware of the situation and unprepared, and because of marching in the summer heat, many people suffered from malaria, there was no base, the troops lacked training, and the military discipline was poor, so they could not fight, resulting in great losses. Comrade Lu Deming was killed in battle. In this revolutionary low tide situation, although unstable elements withdrew from the revolutionary ranks, the resolute warriors, even if seriously injured, still followed Chairman Mao unswervingly. Most of these comrades later heroically sacrificed in the ten-year land revolutionary war, the eight-year anti-Japanese war, and the three-year liberation war, shedding their last drop of blood for the people. Now there are only more than thirty of them left.
　　After the defeat at Luxi, the troops continued to advance, passing through Lianhua to Sanwan, where they were reorganized into one regiment, and then passing through Yongxin and Ninggang to the Jinggangshan area. Here, Chairman Mao set about establishing a revolutionary base in the central section of the Luoxiao Mountains and began a new stage of revolutionary struggle.
　　In November 1927, our army captured Chaling and established the first revolutionary regime - the People's Revolutionary Committee. Later, it joined forces with the peasant guerrillas of eastern Hunan, southern Hunan, and the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, especially in April 1928, it joined forces with the troops of the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising led by Comrade Zhu De, and in December 1928, it joined forces with the troops of the July Uprising in Pingjiang led by Comrade Peng Dehuai. Thus, the momentum of the revolutionary base area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, centered on Jinggangshan, became greater and greater.
　　From the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the establishment of the Jinggangshan base area was an important historical juncture in the Chinese revolution, and its significance was extremely significant. Without Chairman Mao's wise and correct leadership, in the situation of revolutionary low tide at that time, either blind adventurism or retreat and escape would inevitably have caused even greater losses to the revolution. Because Chairman Mao insisted on the struggle on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, the Chinese revolution found a new form of development after the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War - the rural revolutionary base area, and from this it developed to today's great People's Republic of China.

　　秋收起义前后的片断回忆
    刘型
    一九二五——一九二七年，北伐军发展到长江流域。这时全国人民特别是广大工农群众，革命热情极高，要求把革命继续深入和扩大下去，而帝国主义、封建买办势力却极力破坏这个革命，企图颠覆革命势力，维持并巩固其反革命统治。在一九二七年上半年，一方面，政治形势变化得十分险恶。发生了一连串的反革命事变：蒋介石三月中旬在赣州南昌屠杀工人，三月下旬在安庆屠杀民众，四月十二、十三两日又在上海大规模屠杀工人和革命民众，公开宣布“肃清”共产党，完全揭穿了自己的反革命真面目。但在另一方面，革命势力也在继续扩大深入：武汉革命势力继续向北伸张，南方各省（主要是湖南）农民运动高涨，反对豪绅恶霸，建立乡村农民革命政权，开始要求分配土地。毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中指出：“目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。很短的时间内，将有几万万农民从中国中部、南部及北部各省起来，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅都将被他们最后葬入坟墓。一切革命的党派，革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手划脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每个中国人对于这三项都有选择的自由，不过时局将强迫你迅速地选择罢了。”
    五月二十一日（马日）长沙军阀许克祥的叛变，是反革命势力向湖南革命势力进攻的一页惨史！由于当时的革命领导者犯了机会主义的错误，革命势力遭受到重大的损失。随后萍乡发生“六五事变”，醴陵、萍乡的革命势力退入安源（即萍乡矿区）。继蒋介石反革命集团的徐州会议后，武汉政府叛变了。我党召开了“八七”会议，纠正了陈独秀机会主义的领导路线，改组了党中央的领导成份，决定了坚持并深入革命的正确路线。与“八一”南昌起义同时，党中央派毛主席来湖南领导农民秋收起义，以恢复并坚持革命阵地。这是中国革命从第一次国内战争时期到第二次国内战争时期的一个重要的转折点。
    武汉政变后，卢德明（团长）同志率领的第二方面军警卫团（该团有二百多安源工人，内有我党党员十多名，由高自立同志率领，到武昌后编为一连，由伍中豪同志任连长），于七月三十一日由武昌乘船东下。至中途，得知南昌起义，九江被阻，不能通过，即在阳新黄颡口登陆，开入阳新县城，拟经武宁、靖安至南昌会师。部队行至奉新，得悉朱德、贺龙、叶挺等同志已率部经赣东、福建向东江前进，当时赣江两岸驻有反动军队第三军、第六军、第九军，不能通过。党乃决议密派卢德明同志去南昌探听消息，部队则折回修水（湘、鄂、赣三省边境）训练，并以江西省防军暂编第一师为临时番号，以取得缓冲机会，充实力量，整训部队，俟了解敌情后，再决定行动。不久，平江、浏阳一带农民自卫军和湖北崇阳通城一带农民自卫军相继赶到，即编为第三团，开往铜鼓训练。这时正值毛主席奉党中央命来领导部队行动（卢德明同志也来），支持农民斗争，以打败反革命势力的进攻，恢复革命阵地，深入发动革命的武装斗争。当时党的计划是要实现这样几项任务：（一）革命的共产党与反革命的国民党完全脱离关系，分清敌我；（二）组织工农革命军队；（三）没收地主土地财产，分给贫苦农民；（四）推翻国民党反革命政权，建立以共产党为领导的革命政权；（五）组织工农兵代表会议政权。这就是中国革命史上秋收起义的目的。
    毛主席为了领导秋收革命斗争，曾奔走于安源矿工与平江、浏阳、醴陵一带农民自卫军之间。当时反革命气焰甚凶，到处捕捉革命的工农及青年学生，稍有“赤化”嫌疑，即被枪毙。有一次，毛主席（反革命分子并不知道是他）在浏阳文家市被反动的“民团”扣留了。毛主席在被解往浏阳县城不远时，机智地逃脱了，躲藏在一个有深草的池塘里。这时民团士兵到处追寻他，且强迫附近农民搜索他。搜索的人好几次走到他的附近，但终于没有发现，直到夜暮，只好停止搜索。毛主席爬山越岭，走了通宵。没有鞋子，脚被打烂了。经过沿途革命农民的照应（农民也不知道是他），买了一把雨伞，一双鞋子、一些食物，穿过罗霄山脉北段，才安抵革命军队中。当时毛主席到达部队时，身上仅只剩有两个铜元了。
    当毛主席到达部队以后，即以前敌委员会书记的资格，召开党的会议，决定组成工农革命军第一军，以卢德明为军长。以安源的工人和萍乡醴陵的农民自卫军编为第二团，王兴亚为团长，任左翼，进攻萍乡（城坚未下）、醴陵（攻下），向浏阳集中。以武昌的警卫团为第一团，另收编夏斗寅进攻武汉被击溃后的残部（流窜在鄂南一带）为第四团，共同进攻平江，为右翼。由农民自卫军编成的第三团，先进攻浏阳东乡白沙市，拟于十二日与第二团会师攻取浏阳。各路得手后，拟定十五日进攻长沙，由城内数百武装同志与数千工人担任内应。不料一、四团进攻平江时，四团叛变，勾结反动军队攻打我第一团，以致攻平江的一路失败。三团闻讯，即停攻浏阳。浏阳反动军队闻我军在平江失利，即向白沙市我三团进攻，我军稍有损失，退出白沙市，会合第一团后，在浏阳万载之间集结整编。第二团因不明情况，按原计划向浏阳进攻，在东门外遭敌伏击，陷入重围，背城面水，大部英勇牺牲，少数逃散。进攻长沙的计划，因而失败。
    毛主席这时决定放弃占领中心城市的方针，转向湘赣边界的井冈山区域建立革命根据地。在一三团会合后，毛主席召集部队训话，以高度的革命决心和信心，来鼓励大家，振作精神，继续沿湘赣边境前进，为建立罗霄山脉中段的革命政权而奋斗。于是部队立即按照计划行进。但路经桐木、小枧，行至芦溪后，又遭反动军队江宝定营伏击。我军以情况不明，没有准备，加以暑天行军，害疟疾者很多，没有根据地，部队缺乏训练，军纪不良，不能作战，致损失很大，卢德明同志战死。在这革命低潮的形势下，尽管不坚定的分子退出了革命的队伍，而坚决的勇士们，虽然身负重伤，却仍然毫不动摇地跟着毛主席走。这些同志们以后在十年土地革命战争，八年抗日战争、三年解放战争中，多数都已英勇牺牲，为人民流了最后一滴血，现在还在的，不过三十多人了。
    芦溪失利后，部队继续行进，经莲花到三湾，改编为一个团，然后又经永新、宁冈，到达井冈山地区。在这里，毛主席就着手建立罗霄山脉中段的革命根据地，开始了革命斗争的新阶段。
    一九二七年十一月，我军夺取茶陵，第一次成立革命政权——人民革命委员会。以后会合了湘东、湘南、湘赣边农民游击队，特别是一九二八年四月，会合了朱德同志所率领的南昌“八一”起义的部队，一九二八年十二月，会合了彭德怀同志所率领的七月在平江起义的部队，于是以井冈山为中心的湘赣边革命根据地的声势，就愈来愈大了。
    由秋收起义到井冈山根据地的创立，是中国革命的重要历史关节，其意义极为重大。如果没有毛主席英明的正确的领导，在当时革命低潮的形势下，或者盲动冒险，或者退却逃跑，都必然会使革命遭到更大的损失。由于毛主席坚持在湘赣边的斗争，中国革命就在第一次国内革命战争失败以后，找到了新的发展形式——农村革命根据地，并且由此而发展到今天的伟大的中华人民共和国。
