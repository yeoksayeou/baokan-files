　　On June 29th, workers at the Wuhu Mingyuan Power Plant listened to the report given by the representative of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. Many moving words from the representative of the delegation echoed in their ears:

　　"Just as the American invading army was about to reach the Yalu River, and we on the south bank of the Yangtze could see the smoke and fire filling the sky on the north bank, the Volunteer Army comrades bravely crossed over!"

　　"The Volunteer Army comrades said: We drink snow water, eat fried flour, and live in air-raid shelters, all for the sake of allowing the people of the motherland to work in a peaceful environment, to eat good food, and to live securely in their houses!"

　　The representative of the delegation also indignantly accused the American invading army of its monstrous crimes of indiscriminately bombing towns and cities in Korea and cruelly harming women and children. Thinking of this, the workers couldn't help but discuss: The American devils are so inhumane; if the Volunteer Army comrades hadn't crossed the Yalu River, we would never be able to live in peace! Some said: The Volunteer Army comrades care about us so much; when they met the delegation representatives, they asked: How are the prices in the motherland? Is the people's life good? They also asked if a certain railway had been completed and how the harvest was last year. The more everyone talked, the more excited they became, wishing they could personally go to Korea and talk to the Volunteer Army comrades.

　　Coincidentally, during this period, the factory was discussing how to revise the patriotic pact, so the trade union and the Communist Party branch immediately called on everyone to combine the discussion of the delegation representative's report with the revision of the patriotic pact.

　　The workers in the machine shop held a group meeting the day after listening to the report. Everyone first reviewed the implementation of the patriotic pact in the past and found that the clause "exchange technology" was not specific enough, and everyone did not earnestly implement it. At the meeting, many workers said: "The machine shop is our battlefield, production is war, and if we don't do a good job in production, how can we be worthy of the Volunteer Army comrades who are climbing mountains and wading through rivers to fight hard in Korea?" They redefined in the patriotic pact: Hold a technical research meeting once a week, first by veteran technicians who will impart the internal structure, performance, and key points for avoiding accidents during operation of each machine in each workshop to young workers and apprentices. Each workshop should pay attention to the exchange of professional knowledge so that everyone can quickly become familiar with the business and the entire production process of the machine shop. Zhuang Zuguang, a veteran technician from the repair shop, said at the group meeting for revising the patriotic pact: "The Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are fighting together and are as close as brothers, so they have constantly won victories. We can only strengthen unity to do a good job in production. I must help the young comrades learn how to operate the mortise machine in the future." Young workers also said: "The Volunteer Army comrades study the enemy's tactics and weaknesses and defeat the enemy's superior equipment. We must also learn from the Volunteer Army comrades' spirit of studying hard, learn technology well from the master workers, and do a good job in production." Everyone specifically included these points in the patriotic pact. At the same time, under the slogan "The Volunteer Army eliminates the enemy at the front, and we eliminate accidents in the rear," each workshop and group also put forward safety guarantees in the patriotic pact.

　　Workers from each unit also formulated long-term production increase and donation plans in the patriotic pact according to their specific circumstances. For example, the workers in the repair shop and the machine shop decided: to use overtime one day a month on Sundays to repair old motors, etc., in the warehouse, and donate all the overtime wages. The workers in the boiler room decided to take advantage of production downtime to carry one hundred tons of coal to the pile every month and donate the earned wages. Worker Zhang Xicheng excitedly said: "The Volunteer Army comrades guarantee to us: to guard the gate of the motherland so that we can produce with peace of mind; we also guarantee to the Volunteer Army comrades: Whatever the Korean front needs, the rear has! As long as our front and rear are united, we can achieve final victory!"

　　听了赴朝慰问团代表的报告以后
    （新华社记者杨璋）
    六月二十九日，芜湖明远电厂的工人听到了中国人民赴朝慰问团代表的传达报告。慰问团代表的许多动人的话句，在他们的耳中萦然回响：
    “就在美国侵略军快打到鸭绿江边，我们在江南岸已经看得见北岸漫天烟火的时候，志愿军同志英勇地打过去了！”
    “志愿军同志说：我们喝雪水、吃炒面、住防空洞，就是为了使祖国人民能在和平环境里工作，能吃好饭，能安稳地住在房子里！”
    慰问团代表还激愤地指控了美国侵略军在朝鲜滥炸城镇、残害妇女儿童的滔天暴行。想到这些，工人们不由自主地纷纷议论说：美国鬼子这样惨无人道，要不是志愿军同志打过鸭绿江，我们怎么也不能过太平日子了！有的说：志愿军同志多关心我们，见了慰问团代表就问：祖国物价怎样？人民生活可好？还问某条铁路修通了没有？去年的收成怎样？大家愈谈愈兴奋，恨不得亲自到朝鲜和志愿军同志谈谈天才好。
    刚巧，这一时期，厂里正在酝酿怎样修订爱国公约，所以工会和共产党支部马上便号召大家把讨论慰问团代表报告和修订爱国公约的工作结合起来。
    机器间工人在听了报告的第二天便召开了小组会。大家首先检查了过去执行爱国公约的情况，发现公约中“交流技术”一条就订得很不具体，大家也不认真执行。会上，许多工人都说：“机器间就是我们的战场，生产就是打仗，如果不搞好生产，怎对得起在朝鲜爬山过水艰苦作战的志愿军同志？”他们在爱国公约中重新规定：每星期开一次技术研究会，首先由老技工把各车间每部机器的内部构造、性能和操作时避免事故的关键，传授青年工人和艺徒。各车间注意交流业务知识，使每个人都能很快熟悉业务和整个机器间的生产过程。修理间老技工庄祖光在修订爱国公约的小组会上说：“志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起打仗，和自家兄弟一样亲，所以不断打了胜仗。我们也只有加紧团结，才能搞好生产。我以后一定要帮助青年同志们学会开梢子槽。”青年工人也说：“志愿军同志研究敌人作战的门窍和弱点，打垮了敌人的优势装备。我们也要学习志愿军同志的钻研精神，好好向老师傅们学习技术，搞好生产。”大家把这些都具体地订进了爱国公约。同时，在“志愿军在前线消灭敌人，我们在后方消灭事故”的口号下，各车间、小组还在爱国公约中，提出了安全保证。
    各单位工人并根据具体情况，在爱国公约中订出了长期增产捐献的计划。例如修理间和机器间工人决定：每月利用星期日加班一天，修理库房中的旧马达等，加班的工资全部捐献出来。锅炉间工人们决定利用生产空隙时间，每月抬一百吨煤上堆，捐出所得工资。工人张锡成激动地说：“志愿军同志向我们保证：要守住祖国大门，使我们能安心生产；我们也向志愿军同志保证：朝鲜前线要啥后方就有啥！只要我们前线后方扭成一股劲儿，就能取得最后胜利！”
