　　Prepare for the North China Region Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition

    The North China Region Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition Conference is scheduled to open in Tianjin in early October this year. This is a major event in North China's financial and economic work in the second half of the year. This conference will not only play a significant role in connecting urban and rural materials exchange in North China, but will also have a significant impact on connecting materials exchange between the North and South, inside and outside the customs, and between China and foreign countries.

    Since last winter, due to vigorous promotion of local products, North China's local products have been largely sold out, and farmers have increased their income by a large amount (worth approximately 7 billion catties of grain, equivalent to one-fourth of North China's grain production). This has played a huge role in expanding the market for industrial products, stimulating industrial and agricultural production, consolidating financial and price stability, increasing state revenue, and supporting the fight against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Now, although North China's existing local products have been largely sold out, how to overcome the blindness in production and operation, further develop more commercial routes in a planned and organized manner, and how to further expand supply to meet the needs of farmers for means of production and means of livelihood after their purchasing power has greatly increased, has become a problem that we must solve in our continued progress. Based on experience, local product exchange exhibitions are an effective way to solve this problem. Therefore, it is entirely necessary and timely for the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government to decide to hold the North China Region Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition in October this year.

    The main tasks of the North China Region Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition have been stipulated in the conference's work plan as: "Vigorously promote agricultural products, by-products, specialties, handicrafts, medicinal materials, aquatic products, livestock products, minerals, etc. The venue of the exhibition will be the market. During the exhibition, we must solicit a large amount of business, sign various contracts and agreements to organize materials exchange between urban and rural areas in North China, between provinces, between North China and other major regions, and between China and foreign countries this autumn and winter and next spring, and consolidate existing commercial networks, develop new commercial networks, and establish regular trade relations with all parties." The exhibition content of the conference will include industrial and handicraft products needed for the production and life of urban and rural people, information on the origin, output, production period, use, specifications, prices, and sales of various major products, as well as introductions to the achievements of labor models and the improvement of industry and commerce. In the conference's work plan, it is also clearly stipulated that materials exchange exhibitions must be closely integrated with political education: "In the entire exhibition, we must fully reflect the policy of all directions (considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges) and the spirit of urban leadership over rural areas, industrial leadership over agriculture, worker leadership over farmers, and the worker-peasant alliance, and in particular, we must permeate every exhibition hall with patriotic ideology, so that visitors can experience the superiority of the new China's political system, thereby enhancing everyone's enthusiasm for loving the motherland." "We must show the victory of our country's economic struggle against imperialist countries and the development and importance of our country's trade relations with the Soviet Union and new democratic countries." In short, if such an exhibition is well held, it will have great gains both economically and politically.

    In order to hold this materials exchange exhibition conference well, we must now seize the preparation work. The quality of the preparation work is the key to determining the success or failure of the conference in the future.

    The financial and economic work committees of the people's governments of all provinces and cities in North China and the Communist Party committees at all levels in North China should earnestly lead the preparatory work in their respective provinces and cities, and dispatch a group of capable cadres who understand the overall economic situation of their respective provinces and cities to participate in the actual work of the conference. We must mobilize the industrial and commercial circles through local federations of industry and commerce, so that they regard this matter as their own, thereby widely absorbing talents from all parties to participate in the actual work of the conference and giving play to their enthusiasm.

    Each province and city should establish an organization such as a preparatory committee for the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition, under the unified leadership of the financial and economic committees of each province and city, to ensure the completion of the preparatory tasks. At present, the focus of work should be on the collection of exhibits, which is a complex and meticulous task, and a specific plan for this work should be formulated quickly. Secondly, investigation and research work should be carried out. First, investigate what farmers in various places need after this year's autumn harvest, how much they need, what the specifications and prices are, and when they are needed. Secondly, we must investigate the origin, production period, output, specifications, prices, uses, and sales of various major products, paying particular attention to slow-selling products. All of this information should be made into detailed charts and brochures.

    In order to prepare for the exhibition, all localities should clean up their contracts once. This year, North China has signed many contracts with other major administrative regions, and provinces and cities have also signed many contracts with each other. However, due to the lack of unified leadership, some confusion has occurred. How many contracts have we signed? How much material has been sold? How much is left? We need to clean it up once so that we can conduct transactions in a planned and informed manner at the October exhibition, avoiding the shortcomings of the past where we did not dare to sign contracts because we did not understand the bottom line, or we signed contracts in a muddled way, resulting in disputes due to failure to realize them.

    The time remaining before the opening of the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition is very pressing. It is hoped that all Communist Party members, cadres, engineers, scientific workers, art workers, workers, farmers, people in industry and commerce, and representatives of ethnic minorities in all localities who are participating in the preparatory work for the exhibition will immediately take action, pool their wisdom and efforts, overcome difficulties, and strive to do a good job in various preparatory tasks and to make this significant exhibition a success.

### 作好华北区城乡物资交流展览会的准备工作

　　作好华北区城乡物资交流展览会的准备工作
    华北区城乡物资交流展览大会决定于本年十月初在天津市开幕。这是华北今年下半年财经工作的一件大事，这个大会不但在沟通华北城乡物资交流上有重大作用，而且在沟通南北之间、关内外之间和国内外之间物资交流上，亦将发生很大作用。
    自去年冬季以来，由于大力推销土产，华北土产已经大体销完，农民增加了一笔很大收入（约值七十亿斤粮食，等于华北粮食产量的四分之一）。这对扩大工业品市场、刺激工农业生产、巩固金融物价稳定、增加国家税收、支援抗美援朝等方面，都起了极大的作用。现在，华北现存土产虽已大体销完，但如何克服生产上和经营上的盲目性，进一步有计划地有组织地开辟更多的商业路线，如何进一步扩大供应，以满足农民购买力大大提高后对生产资料和生活资料的需要，就成为我们继续前进中必须加以解决的问题。根据经验，土产交流展览会正是解决这一问题的一种有效的办法。因此，中央人民政府华北事务部决定本年十月间举办华北地区城乡物资交流展览会，是完全必要的，适时的。
    华北区城乡物资交流展览会的主要任务，已在大会工作的方案中规定为：“大力推销农产、副产、特产、手工业产品、药材、水产、畜产、矿产等。展览会的会场，就是市场。在展览期间，要大量兜揽生意，订立各种合同和协议，以组织今年秋冬和明年春天华北城乡之间、各省之间、华北与其他大区之间以及国内外之间的物资交流，并巩固已有的商业网，发展新的商业网，与各方面建立经常的贸易关系。”大会的展览内容将包括城乡人民生产和生活需要的工业品和手工业品，各种主要产品的产地、产量、产期、用途、规格、价格、销售等情况，以及劳动模范创造和工商业改进成绩的介绍等。在大会的工作方案中，又明确地规定了物资交流展览必须与政治教育密切结合：“在全部展览会中，必须充分体现出四面八方（公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流）政策及城市领导乡村、工业领导农业、工人领导农民和工农联盟的精神，并特别要将爱国主义思想渗透到大会每个展览馆里去，使参观者都能体验到新中国政治制度的优越性，从而提高大家爱护祖国的热情。”“要显出我国对帝国主义国家经济斗争的胜利和我国与苏联、新民主主义国家贸易关系的发展及其重要意义。”总之，这样一个展览会，如果开好的话，在经济上和政治上都将有很大的收获。
    为了开好这个物资交流展览大会，目前就必须抓紧准备工作。准备工作的好坏，是决定将来大会成败的关键。
    华北各省市人民政府财政经济工作委员会，中共华北各级党委应当认真领导该省、市的筹备工作，调派一批得力的了解该省、市全面经济情况的干部参加大会实际工作。必须通过各地工商联合会把工商界动员起来，使他们把这件事情看成是他们自己的事情，从而广泛吸收各方人材参加大会的实际工作，发挥他们的积极性。
    各省、市应成立华北城乡物资交流展览会筹备会之类的机构，由各省、市财经委员会统一领导，保证完成筹备任务。目前应把工作重点放在展览品征集上，这是一个繁杂而细致的工作，应迅速订出这一工作的具体计划。其次是进行调查研究工作，先调查各地农民今年秋收后究竟需要什么，需要多少，规格、价格如何，何时需要。其次要调查各种主要物产的产地、产期、产量、规格、价格、用途、销路，特别要注意滞销的产品。这些资料，都应当制成详细的图表和说明书。
    为了准备展览会，各地都应当清理一次合同。今年，华北各地自行和其他大行政区订了不少合同，省、市与省、市之间也订了不少合同。但由于没有统一领导，以致发生了一些混乱现象。究竟我们已经订了多少合同？已卖出多少物资？还剩余多少？需要清理一次，以便在十月展览会中有计划地有根据地进行成交，避免过去因为没有摸清底子而不敢订合同，或者糊里糊涂地订了合同，结果实现不了而发生纠纷的缺点。
    现在离开华北城乡物资交流展览会开会的时间十分紧迫。希望各地所有参加展览会筹备工作的共产党员、干部、工程师、科学工作者、美术工作者、工人、农民、工商界人士和少数民族代表等，立即行动起来，群策群力，克服困难，为做好各项筹备工作，为开好这个意义重大的展览会而努力。
