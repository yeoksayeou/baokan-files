　　Soviet Navy Day
　　Soviet Navy Major General, Chaiernaishefu
　　This year on July 29th, the Soviet people will commemorate the traditional holiday – Soviet Navy Day. Amidst the outstanding achievements made in the great construction of communism, the Soviet state now summarizes the work of sailors, workers in the shipbuilding industry and other industrial sectors, engineers and technicians in consolidating the military power of the socialist superpower’s navy.
　　Navy Day is a very important day.
　　This holiday was established in 1939 by the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party "in order to mobilize the broad masses of working people around the issue of the construction of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Navy…"
　　The Soviet Navy occupies an important position in the military system of the Soviet armed forces, reliably ensuring the security of the Soviet state's coast.
　　The Soviet Union is a great naval power. More than two-thirds of the Soviet Union's borders are coastlines. Thirteen seas and three oceans wash the shores of the Soviet Union.
　　For a long time, the Russian people have been known for their love of the sea and navigation. The heroic sons of the people's sailors – the brave and fearless Russian navigators – have made many discoveries of world significance.
　　Russian sailors were not only famous travelers and explorers, but also brave warriors and ardent patriots.
　　Russian shipbuilders and engineers surpassed foreigners in many respects, manufacturing first-class ships, excellent machinery, and equipment. Russia built armored cruisers three years earlier than Britain and thirty years earlier than the United States. Similarly, Russia is also the birthplace of submarines. Many outstanding inventions in naval technology in Russia were rejected by foolish Tsarist officials and stolen by foreigners.
　　The talented radio inventor Popov, the creator of the world's first electric light, Lodygin, and Yablochkov, and the creator of the world's first airplane, Mozhaisky, all worked in the Russian fleet. At the beginning of this century, the work of the outstanding Russian scientist Krylov promoted the creation of first-class warships. After the Great October Socialist Revolution, Academician Krylov, a hero of socialist labor, founded the world's best Soviet shipbuilding school.
　　The Soviet Navy maintains and inherits the glorious fighting and revolutionary traditions of the Russian fleet. This is the tradition of the heroic armored ship "Potemkin," and the tradition of the cruiser "Aurora," whose guns on October 25, 1917, announced the beginning of a new century – the century of the Great Socialist Revolution. The Navy is a member of the advanced shock force of the proletarian revolution. Lenin-Stalin's Party directed the sailors to the most important areas of combat.
　　The young Soviet state had to wage a fierce battle with the main forces of the imperialist camp to defend its survival. American imperialists organized and led armed combat against our country, attempting to strangle the Soviet regime. Lenin wrote in August 1918: "Now, it is the American tycoons, these modern slave owners, who have opened a particularly tragic page in the bloody history of bloody imperialism, and they have given direct or indirect, open or concealed approval to the armed invasion launched by the British and Japanese beasts in an attempt to strangle the first socialist republic." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Fourth Edition, Volume 28, Page 44)
　　At that time, all working people responded to the call of the Bolshevik Party, rose up to resist the White Guards, the American, British, Japanese, and other aggressors, to defend the achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The sailors stood at the forefront of the defenders of the revolution, fighting heroically to defend the Soviet regime. They helped the Red Army annihilate the enemy and helped the Red Army drive the interventionists out of the country. The legendary feats of the sailors – the heroes of the civil war – will forever remain in the memory of the Soviet people.
　　After the victorious end of the civil war and the complete defeat of the interventionists, the Bolshevik Party put forward the task of reviving the navy. The Soviet naval power needed a strong naval fleet. As early as the Tenth Party Congress in 1921, a historic decision on the revival and consolidation of the navy was adopted. From this time on, a huge nationwide effort to revive and consolidate the military power of the navy began. In 1922, the Communist Youth League, on the proposal of Lenin and Stalin, adopted a resolution at the Fifth Congress to support the navy. These important resolutions strengthened the combat friendship between the Leninist-Stalinist Communist Youth League and the fleet, and solved one of the most important issues, the issue of naval cadres. Tens of thousands of members of the Communist Youth League who came to warships and naval schools formed the basic core of the Soviet state's naval cadres.
　　The concern of the entire Soviet people for strengthening the defense of the socialist motherland and the leadership of the Leninist-Stalinist Party ensured the development of the Soviet Navy. During the several Stalinist Five-Year Plans, the naval fleet developed particularly rapidly. During the first two Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union had built hundreds of new warships, three times more than Tsarist Russia had built in the decades before World War I. On the initiative of Comrade Stalin, the Pacific Fleet and the youngest Northern Fleet were established.
　　The great leader of the Soviet people, Comrade Stalin, has shown and continues to show concern for the navy. The growth and strength of the Soviet Navy are primarily due to the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin. In naval construction, there was no issue, large or small, that did not pass through Comrade Stalin's hands.
　　In order to manufacture first-class warships to continuously replenish the Soviet fleet, shipbuilding workers, engineers, and Soviet scientists and inventors have done much and excellent work.
　　Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government and thanks to the efforts of the entire people, the naval fleet has grown into a powerful force, demonstrating its ability to thoroughly and gloriously fulfill its important role as a faithful assistant to the heroic army and air force in the Great Patriotic War.
　　The immortal glory of the hero cities is inseparable from the heroic feats of the naval soldiers. The marines and warships of the Black Sea Fleet fought selflessly shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet army's land forces near Odessa.
　　The heroic defense of Sevastopol lasted for two hundred and fifty days. Tens of thousands of naval soldiers formed assault teams and went ashore from the warships. Naval soldiers and Soviet army land forces together annihilated one of the most elite armies of the German bandits in the suburbs of Sevastopol. The enemy suffered 300,000 casualties. The Soviet people will forever remember the names of the Black Sea naval soldiers like Ferichanov, Tsibulko, and Klosnoselisky, who displayed unprecedented heroism and courage in the Battle of Sevastopol.
　　The defense of Leningrad gained great glory, and the Baltic Fleet reliably protected the city of Lenin from the sea. Tens of thousands of naval soldiers participated in the land defense of Leningrad. The gun batteries on the warships and the coastal artillery of the Baltic Fleet, together with the land artillery, wove a fire net around Leningrad.
　　The naval soldiers of the Volga River Flotilla performed outstanding feats in the historic Battle of Stalingrad. In all battles, during the large-scale offensive operations conducted by the Soviet troops to completely defeat the German bandits, the naval forces were always the faithful and reliable assistants of the Soviet troops.
　　Soviet submarines and torpedo boats fearlessly and very skillfully attacked the enemy. The sailors on many Soviet submarines have earned immortal honor.
　　During the war, the Soviet Navy sank enemy transport ships and warships with a total deadweight tonnage of millions of tons.
　　During the Great Patriotic War, the Communist Youth League did a lot for the fleet. The Communist Youth League sent its outstanding sons and daughters to the warships. The donation of funds for warship construction was a manifestation of ardent concern for the fleet. The funds donated by the young patriots of the motherland were used to build one hundred and fifty warships.
　　Inspired by the love of the people, the Soviet naval soldiers fought the enemy with unparalleled enthusiasm. They made a great contribution to the worldwide historical victory of our people in defeating Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan.
　　Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the Soviet people, gave a high appraisal of the actions of the Soviet naval forces during the war years. Stalin wrote on July 22, 1945: "Soviet naval personnel showed unparalleled firmness and courage in combat, a high degree of combat initiative and military skill. Sailors on submarines and warships, naval aviators, gunners and marines all inherited and developed all the valuable traditions of the Russian navy... The navy thoroughly fulfilled its duty to the Soviet motherland."
　　The heroism and military skills of the Soviet naval soldiers won supreme praise. Five hundred and thirteen naval soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. During the war, naval soldiers received 350,000 medals and awards.
　　The Soviet people have done everything necessary for their fleet, hoping that it will become stronger and more powerful.
　　Sailors, captains, and naval officers are responding to the concern of the Soviet people, the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin for strengthening the navy with intensive study. Naval soldiers are improving their military and political knowledge and strengthening discipline and organization. They vigilantly defend the peaceful construction of the Soviet people – the builders of communist society.
　　The worldwide historical victories achieved by the Soviet people in the struggle to build a communist society inspire the naval soldiers to selflessly fulfill their responsibilities. Naval soldiers, infinitely loyal to their Bolshevik Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin, vigilantly defend the coastline of the socialist motherland – the bulwark of world peace.

　　苏联海军节
    苏联海军少将　柴尔耐舍夫
    今年七月二十九日，苏联人民将纪念传统的节日——苏联海军节。在进行共产主义伟大建设获得卓越成就的情况下，苏维埃国家现在来总结一下海员、造船业及其他工业部门中的工人、工程师、技术人员在巩固社会主义强国海军军事威力方面的事业。
    海军节是一个很重大的日子。
    这个节日，是一九三九年苏维埃政府和共产党中央委员会“为了动员广大劳动群众围绕在苏联工农海军建设问题周围……”而规定的。
    苏联海军在苏联武装力量军事体系中占有重要的地位，可靠地保证着苏维埃国家海岸的安全。
    苏联是伟大的海军强国。苏联三分之二以上的边界是在海岸线上通过的。十三个海和三个洋冲洗着苏联的海岸。
    很久以来，俄罗斯人民就以酷爱海洋和航海而闻名。人民海员的英勇的儿子——勇敢无畏的俄罗斯的航海家，曾经有过不少具有世界意义的发现。
    俄罗斯海员不仅是著名的旅行家和探险家，而且是勇敢的战士和热忱的爱国者。
    俄罗斯的造船者和工程师在很多方面都超过了外国人，他们制造了头等的船只、优良的器械和装备。俄国比英国早三年和比美国早三十年就制造了装甲巡洋舰。同样，俄国也是潜水艇的故乡。俄国在海军技术方面的许多特出的发明都被昏庸的沙皇官吏拒绝了，被外国人盗用去了。
    天才的无线电发明家波波夫、世界上第一盏电灯的制造者洛兑庚和亚伯洛契科夫、世界上第一架飞机的创造者摩查伊斯基，都曾经在俄罗斯舰队中工作过。在本世纪初叶，俄罗斯杰出的科学家克留洛夫的事业推进了头等军舰的创立。在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，社会主义劳动英雄克留洛夫院士创立了世界上最好的苏维埃造船学校。
    苏联海军保持着并继承了俄罗斯舰队的光荣战斗的和革命的传统。这就是英勇的“波将金”装甲舰的传统，这就是“曙光”号巡洋舰的传统，一九一七年十月二十五日该巡洋舰上的炮声，宣布了新世纪——伟大社会主义革命世纪的开始。海军是无产阶级革命先进突击队中的一员。列宁——斯大林党指挥海员们到战斗最重要的地区中去。
    年青的苏维埃国家不得不和帝国主义阵营的主要力量进行残酷的战斗，以捍卫自己的生存。美帝国主义者组织了并领导了武装战斗来反对我国，企图绞杀苏维埃政权。列宁在一九一八年八月写道：“现在，正是美国的大亨们，这些现代的奴隶主们，打开了血腥帝国主义的血腥历史上的特殊悲惨的一页，他们对于英、日野兽们那企图绞杀第一个社会主义共和国而所发动的武装进军都给了直接或间接的、公开或隐蔽的赞同。”（《列宁全集》，第四版，第二十八卷，第四十四页）
    当时，全体劳动人民都响应了布尔什维克党的号召，奋起抵抗白卫军、美、英、日及其他侵略者，来保卫伟大的十月社会主义革命的成果。海员们站在革命保卫者的前列，为了保卫苏维埃政权，进行了英勇的战斗。他们帮助红军歼灭敌人，帮助红军把干涉者赶出国境。海员们——内战时期的英雄们——的传奇式的功勋，永远留在苏联人民的记忆中。
    在内战胜利结束和干涉者完全失败以后，布尔什维克党提出了复兴海军的任务。苏维埃海军强国需要强大的海军舰队。早在一九二一年第十次党代表大会上，就通过了关于复兴和巩固海军的具有历史意义的决定。从这个时候起即开始了复兴和巩固海军军事威力的巨大的全民性的工作。一九二二年共青团根据列宁和斯大林的提议，在第五次代表大会上通过了作为海军后援的决议。这些重要的决议，加强了列宁——斯大林式的共青团和舰队的战斗友谊，解决了最重大问题之一的海军干部问题。成千成万的来到军舰上和来到海军学校的共青团员们组成了苏维埃国家海军干部的基本核心。
    苏联全体人民对于加强社会主义祖国国防的关怀和列宁——斯大林党的领导，保证了苏联海军的发展。在几次斯大林五年计划期间，海军舰队特别迅速地发展起来了。在最初两次五年计划期间，苏联已制造了几百艘新军舰，其数量比沙皇俄国在第一次世界大战以前的几十年内所制造的军舰还要多三倍。按照斯大林同志的创议，建立了太平洋舰队和最年青的北方舰队。
    苏联人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志，过去和现在都显示着对于海军的关怀。苏联海军的成长和强大首先要归功于布尔什维克党和斯大林同志。在海军建设方面，没有那一样大大小小的问题，不经过斯大林同志的手。
    为了制造头等的军舰，借以不断地充实苏联的舰队，造船工人、工程师以及苏维埃科学家和发明家们，做了很多和很卓越的工作。
    在布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府的领导下和由于全体人民的努力，海军舰队已经成长为强大的力量，它显示有能力彻底而光荣地完成它在伟大卫国战争中英勇的陆、空军忠实助手的重大作用。
    各英雄城的永垂不朽的光荣是和海军战士的丰功伟绩分不开的。黑海舰队的海军陆战队和军舰，曾在敖德萨附近和苏军陆上部队肩并肩地奋不顾身地作战过。
    悉瓦斯托波尔的英雄保卫战历时二百五十天之久。成千成万的海军战士们组成了突击队后，即下了军舰走上陆地。海军战士和苏军陆上部队在悉瓦斯托波尔城郊一起消灭了德寇最精锐部队中的一支军队。敌人伤亡达三十万人。苏联人民将永远记住那些在悉瓦斯托波尔战役中显示空前英雄主义及果敢榜样的费里柴诺夫、齐布里科、克洛斯诺谢里斯基等的黑海海军战士们的名字。
    列宁格勒保卫战获得了伟大的光荣，波罗的海舰队可靠地从海上掩护了列宁的城。成千成万的海军战士参加了列宁格勒的陆地保卫战。军舰上的炮队和波罗的海舰队的海岸炮兵连同陆军炮兵一起织成了列宁格勒的火力网。
    伏尔加河小舰队的海军战士们，在具有历史意义的斯大林格勒战役中曾卓著功勋。在所有的战斗中，在苏军部队为完成彻底击溃德寇而进行的大规模进攻战的过程中，海军力量总是苏军的忠实的和可靠的助手。
    苏联的潜水艇和鱼雷艇大无畏地而且非常熟练地袭击过敌人。苏联许多潜水艇上的海员们都博得了永垂不朽的荣誉。
    在战时，苏联海军击沉了总载重量达数百万吨的敌人的运输船和军舰。
    在伟大卫国战争时期，共青团替舰队做过很多事情。共青团派遣了自己优秀的儿女到军舰上去。军舰建设资金的捐献便是热忱关怀舰队的表现。祖国年青的爱国者们所捐献的资金曾被用来建造一百五十只军舰。
    苏联海军战士们为人民的热爱所鼓舞，曾以无比的热情打击了敌人。他们对于我国人民击溃希特勒德国和帝国主义日本的全世界历史意义的胜利事业作了巨大的贡献。
    苏联人民的领袖和导师斯大林同志对苏联海军力量在战争年月中的行动曾予以很高的评价。斯大林在一九四五年七月二十二日写道：“苏联海军军人在战斗中表现了无上的坚定和勇敢，高度的战斗积极性与军事技巧。潜水艇和军舰上的海员，海军飞机师，炮手与陆战步兵都承受并发挥了俄国海军历来的一切宝贵传统……海军彻底完成了自己对苏维埃祖国所负的天职。”
    苏联海军战士们的英雄主义和军事技巧博得了无上的褒奖。五百一十三名海军战士荣获了苏联英雄的称号。在战争时期，海军战士们曾受到了三十五万个勋章和奖章。
    苏联人民为自己的舰队作了一切必要的事情，希望它更加强大和更有威力。
    海员、舰长、海军军官们都以紧张的学习来回答苏联人民、党、政府和斯大林同志对于巩固海军的关怀。海军战士们都在提高自己的军事和政治的知识，加强纪律性和组织性。他们警觉地保卫着苏联人民——共产主义社会的建造者——的和平建设事业。
    苏联人民在建设共产主义社会斗争中所获得的具有全世界历史意义的胜利，鼓舞着海军战士们忘我地去完成自己的责任。无限忠诚于自己的布尔什维克党、政府、斯大林同志的海军战士们警惕地保卫着社会主义祖国——全世界和平堡垒的海岸线。
