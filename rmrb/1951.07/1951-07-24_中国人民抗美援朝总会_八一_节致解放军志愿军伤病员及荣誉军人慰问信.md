　　China People's Resist America Aid Korea General Association
　  "August 1st" Greetings to the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
　  Letter of Condolence to Wounded and Sick Soldiers and Disabled Veterans
    Dear wounded and sick comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, honored veterans:
    The glorious and great 24th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, "August 1st," is coming. The Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated domestic and foreign reactionaries, achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution, and created a free and happy life for the Chinese people. The just action of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our country thwarted the US imperialist's arrogant plan to destroy Korea and further invade our country, making the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue possible. All the Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the strength and invincibility of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and enthusiastically celebrate "August 1st" as their own festival.
    Dear wounded and sick comrades, honored veterans: As our people warmly celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day, we deeply miss you heroes who have shed blood, been wounded, fallen ill, or become disabled for the people and the motherland. With your blood and sweat, with unparalleled courage and perseverance, you have highly promoted the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation, brave and indomitable. In the People's Revolutionary War, the People's Liberation Army defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was fully supported by US imperialism, and established the people's new China. On the Korean battlefield, the Volunteer Army, in coordination with the Korean People's Army, attacked the aggressive arrogance of US imperialism and made indelible contributions to the Chinese, Korean, and world people. You are worthy of being the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the liberators and most loyal defenders of the Chinese people. We, the people of the whole country, pledge to take you as our shining example and learn from you.
    Although US imperialism has now accepted the Korean armistice negotiations, the armistice negotiations can only succeed if the people of the whole country continue to fight resolutely to support Korea and consolidate national defense. Moreover, even if the armistice is realized, the American aggressors are still occupying our territory of Taiwan and are still actively pursuing a separate peace with Japan and rearming Japan. In addition, the American imperialists have unilaterally declared the end of the state of war with Germany in Europe, openly arming West Germany and expanding the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Because of this, our national troops must continue to strengthen their combat power, and the people of the whole country must continue to intensify the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. The ongoing production increase and donation movement across the country, as of July 22nd, has donated 2,222 aircraft, 127 artillery pieces, 60 anti-aircraft guns, and 10 tanks. Around the "August 1st" festival, all cities and villages across the country have decided to conduct a comprehensive and practical review of the work of providing preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel of the People's Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army, and to launch a mass movement of preferential treatment. More than 300,000 students from all over the country have enthusiastically signed up to join military cadre schools. The people of the whole country are continuing to deepen the patriotic pact movement and implement the patriotic production plan. The people of the whole country have not slackened in the slightest in their work to resist US imperialist aggression and strengthen national defense construction. This can be told to the dear wounded and sick comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteer Army, as well as the honored veterans.
    Comrades, it is extremely glorious for you to shed blood, be wounded, suffer from overwork, or become disabled for the people and the motherland. We would like to extend our highest respect to you on behalf of the people of the whole country, and express our warm condolences, hoping that you will rest and study with peace of mind. We wish you a speedy recovery from your injuries and illnesses, and that those who are disabled will forever maintain their glory and continue to fight against US imperialist aggression and defend peace in China and the world.
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
    Long live the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea!
              China People's Resist America Aid Korea General Association

　　中国人民抗美援朝总会
　  “八一”节致解放军志愿军
　  伤病员及荣誉军人慰问信
    亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军伤病员同志们，荣誉军人同志们：
    光荣伟大的中国人民解放军第二十四周年建军节“八一”到来了。中国人民解放军战胜了国内外反动派，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利，为中国人民创造了自由、幸福的生活。中国人民志愿军抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动，挫败了美帝国主义灭亡朝鲜并进一步侵略我国的狂妄计划，使朝鲜问题的和平解决有了可能。全中国人民都为中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的强大无敌而欢欣鼓舞，把“八一”当成全中国人民自己的节日而热烈地庆祝。
    亲爱的伤病员同志们、荣誉军人同志们：当我们全国人民热烈庆祝“八一”建军节的时候，我们心里十分怀念着你们这些为人民为祖国流血负伤或者抱病或者残废了的英雄们。你们以自己的血汗，以无比英勇和坚毅的精神，高度发扬了爱国主义与国际主义的伟大精神，表现了中华民族勇敢顽强的英雄气概。解放军在人民革命战争中，打败了美帝国主义所全力支持的蒋介石匪帮，建立了人民的新中国。志愿军在朝鲜战场上，配合朝鲜人民军，打击了美帝国主义的侵略气焰，为中、朝人民与世界人民立下了永远不可磨灭的大功劳。你们不愧是中国人民最优秀的儿女，是中国人民的解放者和最忠诚的保卫者。我们全国人民誓以你们做我们光辉的榜样，向你们学习。
    现在美帝国主义虽然接受了朝鲜的停战谈判，但是只有全国人民继续为支援朝鲜和巩固国防而坚决奋斗，停战谈判才有成功的可能。而且即使停战实现，美国侵略者仍然侵占着我国的领土台湾，仍然在积极地进行着与日本单独媾和和重新武装日本。除此以外，美国帝国主义者又在欧洲片面地宣布结束对德战争状态，公开武装西德，扩展北大西洋侵略集团。因为这样，我全国部队必须继续加强战斗力量，全国人民必须继续加紧抗美援朝的爱国运动。全国人民正在继续开展的增产捐献运动，截至七月二十二日止。已捐献飞机二千二百二十二架，大炮一百二十七门，高射炮六十门，坦克十辆。在“八一”节前后，全国所有城市和乡村决定对优待人民志愿军和人民解放军一切革命烈士家属和军人家属的工作，作普遍的切实的检查，开展群众性的优抚运动。全国各地学生已有三十几万人，踊跃报名参加军事干部学校。全国人民正在继续深入开展爱国公约运动，贯彻执行爱国生产计划。全国人民并未丝毫松懈反抗美帝国主义侵略、加强国防建设的工作，这是可以告慰于亲爱的人民解放军和人民志愿军伤病员同志们以及荣誉军人同志们的。
    同志们，你们为人民为祖国而流血负伤，积劳成疾，或者成了残废，是光荣极了。我们谨代表全国人民向你们致以崇高的敬礼，并表示热烈的慰问，盼望你们安心休养和学习，谨祝你们负伤卧病的早日恢复健康，残废了的永远保持自己的光荣，并继续为反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫中国与世界和平而奋斗。
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    抗美援朝胜利万岁！
