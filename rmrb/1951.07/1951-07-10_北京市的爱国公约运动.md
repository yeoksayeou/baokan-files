Beijing's Patriotic Pact Movement
　　Zhang Qingji
　　Editor's Note: The work of revising patriotic pacts in Beijing has developed into a mass movement with leadership. Their experience is worth paying attention to. The experience of Beijing proves that leading organs must seize the establishment of patriotic pacts on the basis of the masses' political consciousness. This is an important form to improve and consolidate the people's patriotic enthusiasm and continue to strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea and various construction works. The General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea calls on all parts of the country to conduct a general inspection of the work of revising patriotic pacts in July, and then, based on the results of the inspection, improve this work and promote its experience. The districts of Beijing are currently holding representative conferences for resisting America and aiding Korea to inspect and revise patriotic pacts. This practice is worth referring to in various places.
　　
The patriotic pact movement in Beijing has been widely launched since April. Over the past two months, it has shifted from a spontaneous mass movement to a planned and led movement. The scope of pact signing has gradually deepened from large units to small units, and the content has gradually become clear and specific. Patriotic pacts have begun to play a role in promoting work.
　　
Before May 1st, with the popularization of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of people from all walks of life increased, and they spontaneously signed patriotic pacts. By the end of April, the number of people participating in the signing of patriotic pacts had reached more than 900,000. However, at this time, the patriotic pact movement still had a large degree of spontaneity and lacked planned leadership. Most patriotic pacts were signed on the basis of the entire district or a class or an industry. The content of the pacts mostly did not link political content with business. After May 1st, among the organized masses such as workers and students, the patriotic pact movement gradually penetrated into small units, and the content of the pacts began to be combined with production, work and study; but for the masses with weaker organization, such as industry and commerce, their patriotic pacts still remained in a large scope. By the end of May, the number of people participating in signing patriotic pacts in the city had increased to more than 1.16 million. Since June, in order to respond to the three calls issued by the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, people from all walks of life have greatly promoted the patriotic pact movement. The scope of pact signing has penetrated into workshops, teams, courtyards and families. Some have also formulated personal plans to implement patriotic pacts. According to incomplete statistics, employees of 12 factories and mines, such as the Tram Company and Mentougou Coal Mine, have signed 186 workshop or branch factory patriotic pacts; employees of nine units, such as the Telecommunications Bureau, have signed 680 team patriotic pacts. In the 23 hutongs in the 14th police station area of District 1, 80% of households have signed family patriotic pacts. Currently, the districts in the city are holding representative conferences for resisting America and aiding Korea, with the inspection and revision of patriotic pacts as the central topic, and promoting patriotic pacts has become a mass movement with leadership, purpose and planning.
　　
According to preliminary key inspection materials, patriotic pacts are indeed the best form to promote national construction, guide the progress of the masses, and unleash the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. After the signing of patriotic pacts, a branch factory of the Changxindian Railway Factory completed the monthly production task of boiler accessories in ten days. In a branch factory of the Machine General Factory, the defect rate dropped from the original 55% to 1.5%. In some private enterprises, after the signing of patriotic pacts, the relationship between labor and management has been further improved. In schools, students respect teachers more, and teachers care for students more. Many people regard striving to study as an important part of the patriotic pact and have automatically established organizations for current affairs, politics, and cultural studies based on the pact. For example, workers in small factories in District 3 organized 46 newspaper reading groups; residents in the fifth police station area of the district established 70 newspaper reading groups; residents in District 7 established more than 100 active newspaper reading groups; in the 11th police station area of District 5, seven women's literacy classes and two political study classes have been newly established.
　　
After the signing of the patriotic pacts, a large number of mass activists participated in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea and various construction works in the district streets; many people reported counter-revolutionaries and eliminated the phenomenon of unreported household registrations. Patriotic pacts have also promoted the use of criticism and self-criticism by people from all walks of life, strengthened unity, and made disharmonious neighbors or family members harmonious. In addition, it has also promoted the masses to reform family hygiene and environmental hygiene.
　　
However, the patriotic pact movement is a new task. In the early stage of signing patriotic pacts, both the leading organs and the masses lacked experience. In addition, without sufficient deliberation, many patriotic pacts were signed relatively hastily. For example, the patriotic pacts of some stores were casually written by the bookkeeper. Women in District 5 hastily signed 2,871 patriotic pacts in one day after a broadcasting accusation meeting. Many of the patriotic pacts of more than 700,000 street residents were still signed on the basis of the entire district or section, some of which included three or four hundred households, which were very unspecific. Many of the residents' family patriotic pacts were just a few empty slogans. In addition, some city-wide or industry-based patriotic pacts were not only unspecific in content but also unable to supervise and inspect each other. In addition, some patriotic pacts had complicated or impractical clauses that were difficult to implement.
　　
Beijing has gained some experience in promoting the patriotic pact movement: First, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity work and meticulous organizational work. In terms of publicity, it should be made clear to the masses why patriotic pacts should be signed, what content they should include, how to sign or how to check the implementation, so that everyone has a deep understanding and can earnestly implement them. In terms of organizational leadership, it is necessary to be able to analyze and study the situation, fully mobilize the masses to conduct discussions, and formulate concise and practical pacts. Second, an inspection system should be established, especially to mobilize the masses to supervise and inspect each other, and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to promote the realization of patriotic pacts. Third, the leading role of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models and other activists should be brought into play to unite the masses to jointly formulate, implement, inspect and revise patriotic pacts. At the same time, model figures in the patriotic pact movement should be cultivated in a planned way to guide the masses forward. For example, Liu Dezhen, a labor model of the Shijingshan Power Plant, first mobilized the team he led to thoroughly inspect and revise the patriotic pact, driving the patriotic pact movement of the plant's employees.

### 北京市的爱国公约运动

　　北京市的爱国公约运动
    张青季
    编者按：北京市修订爱国公约的工作已经形成了有领导的群众运动。他们的经验值得重视。北京的经验证明，领导机关必须在群众政治觉悟的基础上抓紧订立爱国公约，这是提高与巩固人民爱国热情，继续加强抗美援朝及各种建设工作的重要形式。抗美援朝总会号召全国各地在七月份内把修订爱国公约的工作普遍检查一次，然后根据检查的结果，对这项工作加以改进，推广其经验。北京各区目前正在举行抗美援朝代表会议，检查与修订爱国公约。这种做法值得各地参考。
     北京市的爱国公约运动，从四月份起即普遍展开。两个多月来，已由群众自发性的运动走向有计划有领导的运动。订公约的范围逐渐由大单位深入到小单位，内容也逐渐明确具体。爱国公约已开始发挥推动工作的作用。
    “五一”以前，随着抗美援朝运动的普及，各阶层人民的政治觉悟与爱国热情提高了，纷纷自发地订立爱国公约，到四月底，参加订立爱国公约的人数已达九十多万。但这时爱国公约运动还有很大的自发性，缺乏有计划的领导，多数爱国公约是以全区或一个阶层、一个行业为单位订立的，公约内容多半没有把政治内容同业务联系起来。“五一”以后，在工人、学生等有组织的群众中间，爱国公约运动逐渐深入到小单位，公约内容也开始结合生产、工作和学习；但组织性较薄弱的群众，如工商行业，他们的爱国公约仍停留在大范围中。五月底，全市参加订爱国公约的人数增到一百十六万人以上。六月份以来，各界人民为了响应抗美援朝总会发出的三项号召，把爱国公约运动大大地推进了一步。订约范围深入到了车间、小组、院落和家庭。有的还订立了个人执行爱国公约的计划。据不完全统计，电车公司、门头沟煤矿等十二个厂矿的职工，订立了一百八十六个车间的或分厂的爱国公约；电信局等九个单位的职工，订立了六百八十个小组的爱国公约。一区十四派出所地段二十三条胡同中，百分之八十的住户订立了家庭爱国公约。目前城内各区正在举行抗美援朝代表会议，以检查与修订爱国公约为中心议题，推行爱国公约已成为有领导有目的有计划的群众运动。
    根据初步重点检查的材料来看，爱国公约的确是推动国家建设、引导群众进步、发挥群众爱国热情的最好形式。在订立爱国公约之后，长辛店铁路工厂的一个分场，十天完成了全月锅炉配件的生产任务。机器总厂一个分场，废品率由原来的百分之五十五降低到百分之一点五。电信局一个小组，五月份内节省了三百三十公尺皮线。若干私营企业中，经过订立爱国公约，进一步改进了劳资双方的关系。在学校中，学生对教师更加尊敬，教师对学生更加爱护。许多群众把努力学习当作爱国公约的重要内容，并根据公约自动建立了时事、政治、文化学习的组织。如第三区的小工厂工人，组织了四十六个读报组；该区第五派出所地段的居民，建立了七十个读报组；第七区居民建立了一百多个活动的读报组；第五区第十一派出所地段，新成立了七个妇女识字班和两个政治学习班。
    在爱国公约订立以后，大批群众积极分子参加了区街中的抗美援朝工作和各种建设工作；许多群众检举了反革命分子，消灭了漏报户口现象。爱国公约也推动了各阶层人民使用批评与自我批评的武器，加强了团结，不和睦的邻居或家庭成员变得和睦了。另外，它还推动群众改革了家庭卫生和环境卫生。
    但是，爱国公约运动是一项新的工作，在订立爱国公约的初期，领导机关与群众都缺乏经验，加以没有经过充分的酝酿，有许多爱国公约订得比较草率。例如有些商店的爱国公约，是由管账先生随意写的。第五区的妇女在一次广播控诉大会后，一天中就草率地订了二千八百七十一个爱国公约。七十多万街道居民的爱国公约，有不少还是以全区、全段为单位订立的，其中有的爱国公约包括三四百户，很不具体。居民的家庭爱国公约中，有许多也只是几句空泛的口号。还有一些全市性的或以行业为单位订立的爱国公约，不仅内容不具体，而且彼此无法督促检查。另外，也有一些爱国公约的条文繁复或不切实际，很难执行。
    北京市在推行爱国公约运动中，得到了一些经验：第一，必须进行深入的宣传工作和细致的组织工作。在宣传方面，应当把为什么要订立爱国公约，它应该包括那些内容，怎样订立或怎样检查执行等，向群众讲清楚，使大家有深刻的认识，并能认真执行。在组织领导方面，要能够分析与研究情况，充分发动群众进行讨论，订出扼要而切合实际的公约来。第二，应建立检查制度，特别是发动群众自己互相督促检查，运用批评与自我批评的武器，推动爱国公约的实现。第三，应发挥共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范及其他积极分子等的带头作用，通过他们团结群众共同订立、执行、检查、修订爱国公约。同时，要有计划地培养爱国公约运动中的模范分子，引导群众前进。如石景山发电厂的劳动模范刘德珍，首先发动他所领导的小组彻底检查、修订了爱国公约，带动了全厂职工的爱国公约运动。
