Below are two letters from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers to the people of the motherland. These letters were entrusted to the delegation visiting Korea to bring back.
    --Editor

        (I) To the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots of all ethnic groups in the motherland:

    When we were victoriously advancing south during the Fifth Campaign, we received the letters of comfort,慰劳金, and large quantities of慰劳goods brought by the慰问团. We express our heartfelt gratitude for your actions and extend our sincere and high respects to you.

    From various documents, newspapers, and letters of comfort, we have seen that people from all walks of life in the motherland are enthusiastically carrying out the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, supporting us with practical actions and acting as our backing. These news items have greatly enhanced our fighting will and confidence in annihilating the enemy.

    Fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots! We guarantee that we will fulfill the glorious task of Resisting America and Aiding Korea that you have personally entrusted to us.

    Sincerely,
          Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Unit XX, Ma Hongqiu, Long Wanzhe, Tao Defa
            Yu Zuoda, Fan Chuanfu
        (II) Dear fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots of the entire motherland:

    Since we entered Korea, we have heard Korean mothers and brothers and sisters complaining to us every day about the crimes of the American invading army; we see American bandits destroying Korean cities and villages every day, and strafing our dear Korean parents, brothers, and sisters. It really pains us. Every comrade in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea has made up his mind: to resolutely overcome all difficulties to complete the task of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, to not be afraid to sacrifice everything, to never bow to difficulties, to eliminate all ideas of returning home to enjoy life, and to be determined to stand with the Korean people and fight side by side to defeat the American invading army.

    Our motherland has you working hard in the country to build and support the front lines, and we are at the front lines striking at the American invading army. We have full confidence in smashing the imperialists' conspiracy to destroy Korea and then further cross the Yalu River to kill our compatriots. We must work with the Korean People's Army to defeat the American invading army. We wish the dear people of the motherland good health!
      Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier Jiang Conghao

　　志愿军来信
    下面是志愿军战士们写给祖国人民的两封信，这些信是战士们托赴朝慰问团带回来的。      
    ——编者
        （一）祖国各民族父老兄弟姊妹们：
    当我们在第五次战役中胜利向南进军时，接到了你们由慰问团带来的慰问信、慰劳金和大批慰劳物品。我们对你们这种行动表示万分的感谢，同时向你们致以亲切崇高的敬礼。
    我们从各种文件、报纸和慰问信上面，看到祖国各界人民都在热烈地开展抗美援朝运动，以实际行动来支援我们，作我们的后盾。这些消息，百倍地增强了我们的战斗意志和歼灭敌人的信心。
    父老兄弟姊妹们！你们亲自交给我们的光荣的抗美援朝任务，我们保证一定很好地完成。
    此致敬礼
          志愿军某部  马洪秋  龙万泽  陶德发
            俞作大  范传福
        （二）亲爱的祖国全体父老兄弟姐妹们：
    我们自从进到朝鲜以来，每天都听见朝鲜的母亲们和兄弟姐妹们向我们控诉美国侵略军队的罪行；每天都看见美国强盗在毁灭朝鲜的城市和村庄，扫射朝鲜亲爱的父母兄弟和姐妹们，我们实在心痛。我们每个在朝鲜的志愿军同志，都下了决心：坚决克服一切困难来完成抗美援朝的任务，不怕牺牲一切，决不向困难低头，铲除一切回国享乐的观念，决心与朝鲜人民站在一起并肩作战，来打败美国侵略军。
    我们的祖国有你们在国内努力建设和支援前线，有我们在前线打击美国侵略军，我们完全有信心粉碎帝国主义者想要毁灭朝鲜，然后进一步窜渡鸭绿江杀害我国同胞的阴谋。我们一定要和朝鲜人民军一道，打败美国侵略军。祝祖国亲爱的人民身体健康！
      志愿军某部战士  姜从好
