    The "Rodong Sinmun," the organ of the Korean Workers' Party, published an editorial titled "Extending a Fighting Congratulations to the Chinese Communist Party." The editorial said: Today, the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party is a major event worthy of celebration not only for the Chinese people but also for hundreds of millions of good people around the world who are pursuing freedom and happiness and moving toward the path of peace, democracy, and socialism. The editorial pointed out: Today, the second strongest Marxist-Leninist party in the world – the Chinese Communist Party – organizes and mobilizes 500 million Chinese people to participate enthusiastically in the struggle against the US imperialists, who are frantically attempting to invade China and dominate the world. When the US aggressors launched an adventurous armed intervention against our country as the first step in provoking a new war, occupying a large part of our country's territory and placing our country in a dangerous situation, threatening China's security, the Chinese Communist Party, together with other democratic parties and people's organizations, raised the banner of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending Our Homes and Country," sent the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean battlefield, and under the unified command of the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, displaying selfless heroism in the battle to annihilate the US aggressor troops, and establishing brilliant feats that will be remembered forever in history. The editorial concluded: The Workers' Party and all the Korean people extend a fighting congratulations to the Chinese Communist Party, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary while leading the Chinese people in building a new people's China. Long live the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live the eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!

            Chairman Mao is the Leader of the Chinese People and also the Leader of the Progressive People of Asia
            --Editorial in the Vietnamese "People's Weekly"

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, North Vietnam, 30th: The latest issue of the Vietnamese Labor Party's organ publication, "People's Weekly," published an editorial entitled "Cheer for the Thirty Years of Great Victory Struggle of the Chinese Communist Party," commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.
    After recounting the historical achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people in heroic and victorious struggles since its establishment, the editorial continued: The proclamation of the People's Republic of China and the joining of 475 million people in the world's peace and democracy camp is a great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party. This achievement has a great impact on the Asian situation – even the world situation.
    The editorial stated: The reason why the Chinese Communist Party has achieved such a glorious victory is because it is ideologically, politically, and organizationally based on the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
    The reason why the Chinese Communist Party has achieved such a victory is because it thoroughly understands the essence of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and applies and develops these theories in the conditions of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country.
    The establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and the development of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are due to Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Chairman Mao Zedong established the Chinese Communist Party, taught and led the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to carry out victorious struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and created the New China, thus he is not only the beloved and wise leader of the Chinese people, but also the leader of the progressive people of Asia.
    The editorial concluded: In order to express our respect for the Chinese Communist Party's thirty years of victorious struggle, we, the Vietnamese people, must:
    (1) Follow the example of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and link the struggle for national independence with the struggle to defend world peace and democracy and oppose aggression led by US imperialism. The struggle currently being waged by the Vietnamese people is such a struggle;
    (2) Follow the example of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen, consolidate, and develop the Vietnamese Labor Party – the true vanguard of the Vietnamese people, infused with the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the thoughts of Mao Zedong, as well as the style of Ho Chi Minh, a party that is closely linked to the masses of the people and has a conscious and strict discipline, and a party that constantly moves forward by conducting criticism and self-criticism within and outside the party;
    (3) Learn from the Chinese Communist Party's rich experiences in all aspects: ideological struggle, economic policies, financial policies, national united front policies, and people's democratic regime.

    【新华社一日讯】越南通讯社北越三十日讯：最新一期的越南劳动党机关刊《人民周刊》发表题为《为中国共产党三十年伟大的胜利的斗争而欢呼》的社论，纪念中国共产党成立三十周年。
    社论在历述中国共产党成立以来领导中国人民进行英勇的胜利的斗争的史迹以后，继称：中华人民共和国的宣告成立和四亿七千五百万人民的加入世界和平民主阵营，是中国共产党的伟大成就。这种成就对亚洲局势——甚至全世界局势——具有伟大的影响。
    社论称：中国共产党之所以得到这样光辉的胜利，是因为它在思想上、政治上和组织上是以马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林理论为基础的。

    中国共产党的建立，马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林理论的发展，都要归功于毛泽东主席和中国共产党的其他领袖。
    毛泽东主席建立了中国共产党，教导和领导中国共产党和中国人民对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行了胜利的斗争，并缔造了新中国，从而他不仅是中国人民所爱戴的英明领袖，而且也是亚洲进步人民的领袖。
    社论最后说：为了向中国共产党三十年的胜利斗争表示敬意，我们越南人民必须：
    （一）追随中国共产党和中国人民的榜样，把争取民族独立的斗争和保卫世界和平与民主、反对以美国帝国主义为首的侵略的斗争联系起来。越南人民目前进行的斗争就是这样的斗争；
    （二）追随中国共产党的榜样，加强、巩固、发展越南劳动党——越南人民的真正先锋队、灌注着马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林理论和毛泽东思想以及胡志明作风的党，与人民大众有密切联系并具有自觉的严格纪律的党，以在党内外进行批评与自我批评的方式不断前进的党；
    （三）学习中国共产党的各方面丰富的经验：思想斗争、经济政策、财政政策、民族统一阵线政策、人民民主政权等各方面的经验。
