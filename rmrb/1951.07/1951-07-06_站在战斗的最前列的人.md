　　Those Standing at the Forefront of Battle
　　By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Nai Yin
　　The Chinese Communist Party members taught by the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, possess a profound spirit of internationalism and patriotism. On the Korean battlefield, as in the revolutionary struggle in their homeland, they stand at the forefront of battle, becoming brilliant banners in the fighting.
　　Everyone already knows the heroic deeds of Yang Gensi, heroic company commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Kong Qingsan, artillery hero, Ye Yong'an, hero of single courage, Chen Desheng, anti-tank hero... and others. They are all members of the Chinese Communist Party. Now I want to tell you about the heroic achievements of many other Chinese Communist Party members in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
　　During the May counterattack, just as the Volunteer Army's sharp sword was piercing the enemy's throat in the central sector, the first platoon of a certain company was ordered to cross the Zhaoyang River and seize the 665 Heights of Jifeng Mountain, opening the door for the main attacking force. The attacking troops braved the enemy's fire blockade from three sides, climbing through thorns and up this steep mountain. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce. Qu Hongyun, the second squad leader, was wounded in the leg as he approached the summit, and blood flowed through his trousers onto the ground. This Communist Party member shouted angrily: "I will avenge here!" He knelt and continued to crawl forward. After being wounded a second time, he could not move. He gritted his teeth, rolled to the side of the road, and made way for the troops behind him. He pushed away a comrade-in-arms who wanted to carry him down the mountain and shouted: "Don't worry about me! I want to see you destroy the enemy with my own eyes! Comrades, charge!" His comrades, filled with unrestrained anger, rushed up the mountain past him. The first to reach the summit was another Communist Party member, Zhou Ziming, who used grenades to eliminate the stubborn enemy, forcing the remaining enemies to surrender.
　　During the April counterattack, a unit of the Volunteer Army attacked a high ground held by the U.S. 24th Division. Squad Leader and Communist Party member Han Guolin led a young soldier, Hu Dongguo, at the forefront. On the way, Han Guolin suffered several serious injuries to his legs and waist. He knew he was finished. Now only Hu Dongguo was left. The enemy fire was very dense here, and any further delay would result in casualties for both of them. He said to Hu Dongguo: "You go down the mountain immediately and tell the platoon leader to attack a little to the left, where the enemy fire is less dense. Then you follow them to attack, hurry!" Hu Dongguo refused to leave his squad leader, who had always helped and cared for him. He did not go down the mountain but calmly crawled towards the enemy. Han Guolin knew he could not stop Hu Dongguo, so he called him over softly, held his hand, and said: "You must advance, I won't stop you. Now you are the only one left, be careful! When advancing, keep your body to the side..." As he spoke, he turned his body from the pool of blood, crawled forward, gritted his teeth, and endured the pain, saying: "Crawl like this... start, I'll cover you." Hu Dongguo was moved to tears! He grabbed his squad leader and said: "Don't move, I'll go up!" Hatred burned in Hu Dongguo's heart, and he fought his way through the enemy's fire net, meeting up with the other attacking troops on the ridge and eliminating the enemy. When he went down the mountain, he found that Han Guolin had sacrificed himself due to excessive blood loss, his right hand still tightly clutching the gun bolt. This is how Communist Party members lead non-Party comrades to fight!
　　In every battle, many of those who charge at the forefront are members of the Chinese Communist Party. On the Zhaoyang River front, a certain unit's vanguard battalion penetrated 120 li behind enemy lines in thirteen hours. When passing through Yulunli, the battalion encountered enemy interception from three sides. In this critical situation, Communist Party member Fu Qingxiang raised his arms and shouted: "Communist Party members! This is the time to meet the test!" He picked up a pack of explosives and rushed forward to blast a path for the troops. After that, he always walked at the forefront. If this unit was a sharp knife, then Fu Qingxiang was the tip of the knife. Such deeds are endless.
　　In a certain company of the Volunteer Army, I was deeply moved by an ordinary event. It was the eve of a battle, and the company political instructor—the secretary of the Communist Party branch—was telling me about the heroic deeds of the Communist Party members when someone came into the dugout. This person had a dark red face and a short stature. He handed the instructor a small package wrapped in yellow cloth and then said: "Have you seen our letter of request? We request to be assigned the main attack task. The comrades are all very determined—this is my belongings. If I sacrifice in this battle, the money inside will be my last Party membership dues." He said it so naturally, and when he left, he was as happy as a worker entering his factory or a farmer going to his field. After he left, the instructor opened the yellow cloth package. Inside were 800 Korean won wrapped in oil paper, a small porcelain souvenir with a portrait of Chairman Mao, and a diary with a red silk cover, on which was recorded his home address. This was all the "property" of this Communist Party member! His name was Song Qingshan, and he was the squad leader of the seventh squad. The instructor told me that before every battle, many Party members would express their determination in this way. For the sake of the safety of the motherland, for the liberation of the Korean people, and for the cause of defending world peace, the members of the Chinese Communist Party selflessly shed their blood on the soil of brotherly countries.
　　A company commander of a heavy machine gun company of the Volunteer Army once said: "Communist Party members cannot be subdued by any force; even when they are about to sacrifice, they will drag the enemy into the grave with them." Such touching deeds are numerous on the Korean battlefield. Back in the winter of last year, during the Changjin Lake Campaign, a unit of the Volunteer Army ordered to attack the U.S. military encountered obstacles on the attack route. The troops were suppressed on the hillside by enemy fire from two bunkers facing them, unable to advance or retreat. Any delay at this time would affect the overall battle. Communist Party members Wu Zaiqing and Jiang Delin stepped forward and said to the company commander: "Company commander, give us this task. For the motherland and the Korean people, sacrifice is worth it!" After the company commander granted their request, they picked up two packs of explosives and rushed towards the bunkers. In two loud explosions, the two heroic Communist Party members were shattered along with the two bunkers and more than a dozen enemies inside. The follow-up troops immediately stepped on the bloodstains of the martyrs and charged into the enemy formation. In the Battle of Huayue Mountain in the Hongcheon area in early April, Communist Party member Jiang Weihan detonated a grenade, dying together with the enemy. Another Communist Party member, Wang Xuefeng, after being seriously injured, embraced the enemy and jumped off a cliff. Let us forever remember these immortal martyrs! It is they who, with their lives, have won eternal honor for the motherland and the Chinese people, and have written countless brilliant pages in the great epic of defending world peace.
　　The more precarious the situation, the more the Chinese Communist Party members demonstrate the fearless heroism of communists. On the summit of Jifeng Mountain on the banks of the Zhaoyang River, Zhao Fengmei, a 19-year-old Communist Party member of the Volunteer Army, said to his five comrades: "Hold the position firmly, and never let the enemy come up!" They were like iron nails nailed to the mountain, repelling nine joint land and air counterattacks by the enemy. The enemy used rows of shells to turn the top of the mountain into a sea of fire. Zhao Fengmei cleverly led his comrades to a concealed area and ran back to the front to monitor the enemy. When a platoon of enemies just emerged from the bushes and climbed onto the position, Zhao Fengmei called out his comrades and shouted: "Fight!" A volley of grenades was thrown over, and the enemies immediately rolled down the mountain. When the enemy launched their last counterattack, the ammunition on the mountain was exhausted, so Zhao Fengmei called on his comrades: "No bullets, pick up stones and fight!" Large and small stones flew straight down the hillside, and the enemies were beaten back again. Zhao Fengmei and his comrades fought the enemy like this all day without eating a single bite of food, killing or wounding more than 30 enemies, with only one of them suffering minor injuries.
　　Just as the political commissar of a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army said: "When are Communist Party members needed? It is in the most difficult and arduous times. At this time, Communist Party members must not only overcome difficulties themselves, but also lead and inspire the non-Party masses to overcome hardships and difficulties. If we cannot do this, what kind of 'special material' are we made of?" On the Korean battlefield, it is precisely these many excellent Communist Party members who, with their selfless and exemplary behavior, have influenced and promoted the broad masses of soldiers, overcoming unimaginable hardships and difficulties, and achieving great victories. Dan Ziming, the company commander of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, was wounded in the foot by a landmine in the April battle, and it was extremely painful to walk. But he did not complain and still led his company into battle. Radio operator Chen Seqing had frostbite on both feet during the Changjin Lake Campaign. He didn't tell anyone, wrapped his feet in cloth, and followed the troops day and night, climbing snow-covered mountains and crossing icy rivers, persisting in his work. It was not until the victory of the battle that he cut off his shoes and let the doctor see them. By this time, ten toes were already crippled. The doctor complained about why he hadn't left the battlefield earlier for treatment. He said: "Can I affect the battle mission because of this little thing?"
　　During the arduous great march, who carried the heaviest things, carrying not only their own belongings but also the guns and rice bags of their comrades? Who let others rest first after an arduous march, while they were still busy? Who insisted on maintaining mass discipline during frequent battles, when food and vegetables were in short supply, enduring hunger and leading their comrades up the mountain to dig wild vegetables? If you pay attention, you will find that the vast majority of them are members of the Chinese Communist Party.
　　On the Korean battlefield, the title of "Communist Party member" is the highest honor. The merit book of the Second Company of a certain unit records the deeds of 43 heroes of the entire company, of which 31 are members of the Chinese Communist Party. This is why the broad masses of soldiers respect and trust Communist Party members so much. Countless non-Party soldiers have requested to join the Communist Party. On the front lines, "Fight well and strive to join the Party!" has become the most powerful battle encouragement slogan. In the most dangerous situations, non-Party soldiers shout, "Meet the test and strive to join the Party!" and bravely charge towards the enemy. Many martyrs wrote in their wills: "If I sacrifice, I request the Party to posthumously recognize me as a glorious member of the Communist Party." Many soldiers, before sacrificing in battle, asked the Communist Party branch to allow them to join the Party. Before every battle, the Communist Party branch receives many Party membership applications from soldiers. Many excellent soldiers who have been tested in battle have already entered the glorious ranks of the Chinese Communist Party.
　　Thanks to the great motherland, which has nurtured such brave and hardworking people; thanks to the Chinese Communist Party, which has cultivated such strong and fearless revolutionary fighters; thanks to our great leader Mao Zedong, who taught us how to selflessly fight for the Chinese people and for the peace and happiness of the people of the world. On the Korean battlefield, every Chinese Communist Party member in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is holding up the weapons in their hands and fighting even more heroically to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party and for the bright future of mankind.

　　站在战斗的最前列的人
    新华社记者  耐因
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东所教导出来的中国共产党员，具有着深厚的国际主义和爱国主义的精神。他们在朝鲜战场上，像在祖国的革命斗争中一样，站在战斗的最前列，成为战斗中的光辉的旗帜。
    大家已经知道了中国人民志愿军的英雄连长杨根思、炮兵英雄孔庆三、独胆英雄邺永安、反坦克英雄陈德生……等人的英雄事迹。他们都是中国共产党党员。现在我要告诉大家的是中国人民志愿军中另外许多中国共产党党员的英雄业迹。
    在五月的反击战中，正当志愿军的利剑刺向中线敌军咽喉的时候，某连第一排奉命涉过照阳江，夺取鸡凤山六六五高地，为主攻部队打开出击的大门。攻击部队冒着三面敌人火力的封锁，攀着荆棘，爬上这座峻险的山去。战斗空前激烈。第二班班长曲鸿云在接近山顶的时候，腿部负了伤，血透过裤子流在地上。这个共产党员愤怒的喊着：“我要在这里报仇！”他跪着，继续爬行前进。在第二次负伤之后，他不能动了。他咬着牙滚到路旁，把道路让给后面的部队。他一把推开要背他下山的战友，喊道：“不要管我！我要亲眼看你们消灭敌人！同志们，冲啊！”他的战友们怀着难以抑制的愤怒，从他身旁冲上山去。最先冲到山顶的是另一个共产党员周子明，他用手榴弹消灭了顽抗的敌人，迫使其余的敌人投降。
    在四月的反击战中，志愿军某部攻击美军第二十四师据守的一个高地。班长共产党员韩国林带着一个青年战士胡东国走在最前面。途中，韩国林的腿上，腰上好几处负了重伤。他知道自己不行了。现在只剩下胡东国一个人，这里敌人火力很密集，再迟延下去两个人都会遭受伤亡。他向胡东国说：“你立刻下山告诉排长，向左侧一点攻击，那里敌人火力稀一些。你就随他们攻击吧，快去！”胡东国不肯丢下一向帮助他、爱护他的班长，他没有下山，镇定地向敌人爬去。韩国林知道无法阻挡胡东国，于是轻声地叫他过来，按着他的手说：“你要前进，我不阻挡你。现在只剩你一个人了，要小心！前进的时候要侧着身子……”说着，他就从血泊里侧过身子来，向前爬着，咬住牙忍着痛说：“就这样子爬……开始吧，我来掩护你。”胡东国感动得流了泪！他一把按着班长说：“你不要动，我上去！”仇恨燃烧着胡东国，他硬从敌人火网里打上去，在山岭上和另路攻上来的部队会合，消灭了敌人。当他下山的时候，他发现韩国林已因流血过多而牺牲了，右手还紧拉着枪拴。共产党员就是这样带领着非党的战友作战的！
    在每一次战斗中，那些冲在最前面的人，许多就是中国共产党的党员们。在照阳江前线，某部尖刀营以十三小时插入敌后一百二十里。在通过于论里时，这个营遭遇到三面敌人的阻击。在这危急情况下，共产党员傅庆祥振臂高呼：“共产党员们！这是迎接考验的时候！”他拿起一包炸药，冲上去为部队轰开了道路。这以后，他就一直走在最前面。如果说这个部队是一把锋利的尖刀，那么傅庆祥就是尖刀的刀尖。像这样的事迹是说不完的。
    在志愿军某部的一个连里，我给一件普通的事情深深地感动了。那正是战斗的前夜，连指导员——共产党支部的支部书记正在向我讲述共产党员们的英勇事迹，掩蔽部里进来了一个人。这人有着黑里透红的脸，矮矮的个子。他向指导员递过一个用黄布包起来的小包，然后说：“你看到我们的请战书了吗？我们要求担任主攻任务。同志们的决心都很大——这是我的东西，如果我在这次战斗中牺牲了，里面的钱就作为我缴的最后一次党费吧。”他说得那么自然，走的时候就像工人走进自己的工厂、农民走向自己的田地那样愉快。他走了以后，指导员打开那个黄布包，里面有用油纸包着的八百元朝鲜币，一个有毛主席像的磁质小纪念章，一本用红绸子糊着封面的日记本，上面记着他的家乡地址。这就是这位共产党员的全部“财产”！他的名字叫宋清山，是第七班的班长。指导员告诉我，在每次作战前，总是有许多党员这样表达自己的决心的。中国共产党的党员们为了祖国的安全，为了朝鲜人民的解放和保卫世界和平事业，就是这样无私地把自己的鲜血洒在兄弟国家的土地上。
    志愿军的一位重机枪连连长曾经说过：“共产党员不是任何力量能够屈服的，就是临牺牲的时候，也要拉着敌人进坟墓。”像这样的可歌可泣的事迹，在朝鲜战场上是很多的。还是在去年冬天的长津湖战役中，奉命攻击美军的志愿军某部，在攻击道路上遭受了阻碍。部队被从迎面两座地堡里射出的敌人的火力压制在山坡上，进退不得。这时如果稍一迟延，就会影响全盘战斗。共产党员吴再清和蒋德林当时挺身而出，向连长说：“连长，把这个任务交给我们，为了祖国和朝鲜人民，牺牲也值得！”连长答应了他们的请求后，他们抱起两包炸药，扑向地堡，在两声巨响中，两个英雄的共产党员随着两个地堡和其中的十多个敌人一起粉碎了。后续部队立刻踏着烈士们的血迹冲入敌阵。在四月上旬洪川地区的华岳山战斗中，共产党员蒋维汉拉响手榴弹与敌同归于尽。另一个共产党员王学风在身负重伤以后，抱住敌人跳下了悬崖。让我们永远牢记着这些不朽的烈士！是他们以自己的生命，给祖国，给中国人民争得了永恒的荣誉，在保卫世界和平的伟大史诗上写下了无数页灿烂的篇章。
    中国共产党员们愈是在最危难的时候，就愈是显示了共产主义者的无畏的英雄气概。在照阳江畔鸡凤山的山顶上，志愿军的一位十九岁的共产党员赵凤梅对他的五个战友说：“坚决守住，决不让敌人上来！”他们就像铁钉子一样钉在山上，击退了敌人九次陆空联合反击。敌人用成排的炮弹把山顶打成一片火海。赵凤梅机警地把战友们带到隐蔽地带，自己跑回前面去监视敌人。当一个排的敌人刚钻出树丛爬上阵地的时候，赵凤梅把战友们喊出来，喊声：“打呀！”一排子手榴弹投过去，敌人立刻滚下山去了。在敌人发起最后一次反击时，山上的弹药用光了，赵凤梅就号召他的战友们：“没有子弹，搬起石头来打呀！”大小石块顺着山坡直飞下去，敌人又被打退了。赵凤梅和他的战友们就这样和敌人打了一整天，没有吃上一口饭，杀伤了三十多个敌人，自己只有一人负轻伤。
    正像志愿军某一个团的政治委员所说的：“什么时候需要共产党员呢？是在那最艰苦最困难的时候。这时候，共产党员不仅自己要战胜困难，而且要带领和鼓舞着非党群众去战胜艰苦，克服困难。如果不能这样做，我们还算是什么‘特殊材料做成的人’呢？”在朝鲜战场上，正是那许多优秀的共产党员们，以自己的忘我的模范行为，影响了和推动了广大的战士群众，克服难以想像的艰苦和困难，而取得了伟大的胜利。志愿军某部连长单子明在四月的战斗中，脚被地雷炸伤，走路时疼痛极了。但是他没有叫一声苦，仍然带着他的连队投入了战斗。报话员陈瑟清在长津湖作战中两只脚冻伤了，他对谁也不说，用块布包住脚，跟着部队昼夜爬雪山，过冰河，坚持工作。直到战斗胜利结束，他才割下鞋子来让医生看，这时十个脚指已经残废了。医生埋怨他为什么不早下战场治疗，他说：“我还能因为这点事影响战斗任务吗？”
    在艰苦的大进军中，是谁背的东西最重，身上除了自己的东西以外还有战友的枪支和米袋？是谁在艰苦的行军之后先让给别人休息，自己还在忙来忙去？是谁在频繁的战斗中，在粮菜供应不及的时候，坚持维护群众纪律，忍着饥饿，带领着战友爬上山去挖野菜？如果你留意一下，你会发现，他们极大多数是中国共产党的党员。
    在朝鲜战场上，“共产党员”的称号是最高贵的荣誉。某部第二连的功劳簿上记载着全连四十三名功臣的事迹，其中三十一名是中国共产党党员。这就是广大战士们为什么那样尊敬和信赖共产党员的原因。无数非党战士纷纷请求加入共产党。在前线上，“打好仗争取入党！”已经成为一句最有力量的战斗鼓励口号。在最危急的情况下，非党战士高呼着：“迎接考验，争取入党”，奋勇地冲向敌人。许多烈士的遗书上写着：“如果我牺牲了，要求党追认我为光荣的共产党员。”不少战士在战斗中临牺牲前要求共产党支部允许他们入党。在每次作战之前，共产党支部都收到许多战士的入党请求书。许多经过战斗考验的优秀的战士，已经走进了中国共产党的光荣的行列。
    感谢伟大的祖国，它抚育了这样勇敢而勤劳的人民；感谢中国共产党，它培养了这样坚强无畏的革命斗士；感谢我们伟大的领袖毛泽东，他教导我们怎样忘我地为中国人民、为世界人民的和平幸福而斗争。在朝鲜战场上，中国人民志愿军里的每一个中国共产党员，正高举着手里的武器，为纪念党的诞生的三十周年，为人类的美好的将来而更英勇地战斗着。
