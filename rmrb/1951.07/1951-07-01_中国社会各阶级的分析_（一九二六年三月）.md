　　An Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society
   (March 1926)
    Mao Zedong
    This article by Comrade Mao Zedong was written to combat two tendencies existing within the Party at that time. The first tendency within the Party, represented by Chen Duxiu, only paid attention to cooperating with the Kuomintang and forgot about the peasants. This was right-leaning opportunism. The second tendency, represented by Zhang Guotao, only paid attention to the workers' movement and also forgot about the peasants. This was "left"-leaning opportunism. Both of these types of opportunism felt their own strength was insufficient and did not know where to find strength, where to obtain broad allies. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the broadest and most loyal ally of the Chinese proletariat was the peasantry, thus resolving the most important issue of allies in the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong also foresaw that the national bourgeoisie at that time was a wavering class, and they would split during the upsurge of the revolution, with their right wing running to the side of imperialism. The events that occurred in 1927 proved this point.

    Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution. The reason why all past revolutionary struggles in China have achieved so little success is fundamentally because they could not unite with genuine friends to attack genuine enemies. A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses. There has never been a revolution that did not fail when the revolutionary party led the wrong way. If our revolution is to avoid taking the wrong path and have a certain guarantee of success, we must pay attention to uniting our genuine friends to attack our genuine enemies. If we are to distinguish between genuine enemies and friends, we must make a general analysis of the economic status of each class in Chinese society and its attitude toward the revolution.
    What is the situation of each class in Chinese society?
    The landlord class and the comprador class. In economically backward, semi-colonial China, the landlord class and the comprador class are entirely appendages of the international bourgeoisie. Their survival and development are subordinate to imperialism. These classes represent the most backward and most reactionary relations of production in China, hinder the development of China's productive forces, and are completely incompatible with the aims of the Chinese revolution. In particular, the large landlord class and the large comprador class have always stood on the side of imperialism and are extreme counter-revolutionaries. Their political representatives are the Statists [1] and the right wing of the Kuomintang.
    The middle class. This class represents capitalist relations of production in China. They have a contradictory attitude towards the Chinese revolution: when they feel the pain of being hit by foreign capital and oppressed by warlords, they need revolution and support the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord revolutionary movement; but when the revolution has the courageous participation of the domestic proletariat and the active assistance of the international proletariat, and they feel threatened by its desire to achieve the development of the great bourgeoisie class, they doubt the revolution. The middle class is the so-called national bourgeoisie. Their political主張 is to realize a state ruled by the national bourgeoisie class. Someone calling himself a "true believer" of Dai Jitao [2] published a comment in the Beijing "Chen Bao" [3] saying: "Raise your left hand to overthrow imperialism, and raise your right hand to overthrow the Communist Party." These two sentences depict the contradictory and apprehensive state of this class. They oppose interpreting the Kuomintang's Principle of People's Livelihood with the theory of class struggle, and they oppose the Kuomintang's alliance with Russia and the inclusion of Communists [4] and left-wing elements. However, the attempt of this class - to realize a state ruled by the national bourgeoisie - is completely unworkable, because the current situation in the world is a situation of the final struggle between the two major forces of revolution and counter-revolution. These two major forces have erected two great banners: one is the red banner of revolution, which the Third International holds high, calling on all oppressed classes in the world to gather under its banner; the other is the white banner of counter-revolution, which the League of Nations holds high, calling on all counter-revolutionaries in the world to gather under its banner. Those middle classes will inevitably quickly differentiate, either running to the left into the revolutionary faction, or running to the right into the counter-revolutionary faction, with no room for their "independence." Therefore, the "independent" revolutionary thought of the Chinese middle class, with their own class as the main body, is merely a fantasy.
    The petty bourgeoisie. Such as owner-farmers [5], handicraft owners, small intellectuals – students, primary and secondary school teachers, small clerks, small office workers, small lawyers, small merchants, etc. – all belong to this category. This class, in terms of numbers and class nature, deserves great attention. What owner-farmers and handicraft owners operate is small-scale production. Although the various strata within this petty bourgeoisie are all in the economic position of the petty bourgeoisie, there are three different parts. The first part has surplus money and rice, that is, in addition to self-sufficiency, there is an annual surplus from their physical or mental labor. These people attach great importance to the concept of getting rich, and they worship Zhao Gongyuan Shuai [6] most diligently. Although they do not fantasize about getting rich, they always want to climb to the position of the middle class. They often drool a foot long when they see those respected small landlords. These people are timid, they are afraid of officials, and they are also a little afraid of revolution. Because their economic position is quite close to that of the middle class, they quite believe in the propaganda of the middle class. They take a skeptical attitude towards revolution. This part of the people accounts for a minority in the petty bourgeoisie and is the right wing of the petty bourgeoisie. The second part is economically basically self-sufficient. This part of the people is very different from the first part. They also want to get rich, but Zhao Gongyuan Shuai never lets them get rich. Moreover, because of the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, warlords, feudal landlords, and comprador bourgeoisie in recent years, they feel that the current world is no longer the world it used to be. They feel that if they only use the same amount of labor as before, they will not be able to maintain their lives. They must increase working hours, get up early and go to bed late every day, and pay double attention to their occupations in order to maintain their lives. They scold people a bit, calling foreigners "foreign devils," warlords "commanders who rob money," and local bullies and evil gentry "unjust for the rich." Regarding the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord movement, they only doubt its success (the reason is: foreigners and warlords have such big backgrounds), and they are unwilling to participate rashly, taking a neutral attitude, but they never oppose the revolution. This part of the population is very large, probably accounting for half of the petty bourgeoisie. The third part is declining in life. Many of these people were originally so-called wealthy families, gradually became just able to maintain themselves, and gradually became declining in life. They are shocked every time they settle accounts at the end of the year, saying, "Oh, another loss!" Because these people used to live a good life and have declined year by year, their debts have gradually increased, and they have gradually lived a miserable life, "looking forward to the future, they can't help but shudder." These people feel great pain in their minds because they have a comparison between the past and the present. These people are very important in the revolutionary movement and are a not small mass and are the left wing of the petty bourgeoisie. The above-mentioned three parts of the petty bourgeoisie have different attitudes towards the revolution at ordinary times; but in wartime, that is, when the revolutionary tide is high and the dawn of victory can be seen, not only the left wing of the petty bourgeoisie participates in the revolution, but the middle faction can also participate in the revolution, that is, the right-wing elements are swept up by the revolutionary tide of the proletariat and the left wing of the petty bourgeoisie, and they have to agree with the revolution. From the experience of the May 30th Movement [7] of 1925 and the peasant movements in various places, this judgment is correct.
    The semi-proletariat. The so-called semi-proletariat here includes: (1) the vast majority of semi-owner farmers [8], (2) poor peasants, (3) small handicraftsmen, (4) shop assistants [9], and (5) peddlers, etc. The vast majority of semi-owner farmers and poor peasants are a very large mass in the countryside. The so-called peasant problem is mainly their problem. What semi-owner farmers, poor peasants, and small handicraftsmen operate is an even smaller economy of small production. Although most semi-owner farmers and poor peasants belong to the semi-proletariat, there are still three detailed categories in their economic conditions: upper, middle, and lower. The life of semi-owner farmers is more difficult than that of owner-farmers because about half of their food is not enough every year. They must rent other people's land, or sell part of their labor, or engage in small business to make up for it. Between spring and summer, when the green and yellow are not connected, they borrow money from others at high interest rates and buy grain from others at high prices. Compared with the self-sufficiency of owner-farmers, their situation is naturally more difficult, but better than that of poor peasants. Because poor peasants have no land, they can only get half or less than half of the harvest every year. Although semi-owner farmers only harvest half or less than half of the rented part, they can get all of their own part. Therefore, the revolutionary nature of semi-owner farmers is better than that of owner-farmers but not as good as that of poor peasants. Poor peasants are tenant farmers in the countryside and are exploited by landlords. Their economic status is divided into two parts. Some poor peasants have relatively sufficient agricultural tools and a considerable amount of funds. The result of labor every year is that they can get half of it themselves. The insufficient part can be maintained by growing miscellaneous grains, fishing for fish and shrimp, raising chickens and pigs, or selling part of their labor. In the midst of hardship, there is a hope to end the year. Therefore, their life is more difficult than that of semi-owner farmers, but better than that of another part of poor peasants. Their revolutionary nature is better than that of semi-owner farmers but not as good as that of another part of poor peasants. The so-called another part of poor peasants have neither sufficient agricultural tools nor funds, insufficient fertilizer, poor land harvest, and after sending rent, there is little income. They need to sell part of their labor even more. In times of famine, they beg their relatives and friends for pity, borrow a few dou and a few liters, and deal with three or five days. Debts accumulate, like cattle bearing heavy burdens. They are the most difficult people among the peasants and are most likely to accept revolutionary propaganda. Small handicraftsmen are called semi-proletariat because although they have their own simple means of production and are a free profession, they are also often forced to sell part of their labor. Their economic status is roughly equivalent to that of poor peasants in the countryside. Because of the heavy burden of their families and the disproportion between wages and the price of living, they often face the oppression of poverty and the fear of unemployment, which is roughly the same as that of poor peasants. Shop assistants are employees of shops who use meager salaries to cover household expenses. Prices increase year by year, and salaries often have to be increased every few years. If you talk to these people occasionally, you will see them complaining endlessly. Their position is comparable to that of poor peasants and small handicraftsmen, and they are very receptive to revolutionary propaganda. Peddlers, whether carrying burdens and selling, or selling on the street, are generally small and have meager profits, and they don't have enough to eat. Their position is comparable to that of poor peasants, and their need for a revolution to change the status quo is the same as that of poor peasants.
    The proletariat. The modern industrial proletariat is about two million. Because China's economy is backward, the modern industrial proletariat is not large. Among the approximately two million industrial workers, the main industries are railways, mines, shipping, textiles, and shipbuilding, and a large number of them are enslaved by foreign-funded industries. Although the number of the industrial proletariat is not large, they are the representatives of China's new productive forces and are the most progressive class in modern China, serving as the leading force of the revolutionary movement. Looking at the strike movements of the past four years, such as the seamen's strike [10], the railway strike [11], the Kailuan and Jiaozuo coal mine strikes [12], the Shameen strike [13], and the large-scale strikes in Shanghai and Hong Kong after the "May 30th" incident [14], the power they have demonstrated shows the importance of the position of the industrial proletariat in the Chinese revolution. They are able to do this for two main reasons. The first reason is concentration. No one is as concentrated as they are. The second reason is their low economic status. They have lost their means of production, leaving only their hands, and have no hope of getting rich. They are also subjected to extremely cruel treatment by imperialist warlords and the bourgeoisie, so they are particularly able to fight. The strength of urban coolie workers is also very noteworthy. They are mostly dock porters and rickshaw pullers, and scavengers and cleaners also belong to this category. They have nothing but their hands, and their economic status is similar to that of industrial workers, but not as concentrated or as important in production as industrial workers. China still lacks modern capitalist agriculture. The so-called rural proletariat refers to hired farmers such as long-term workers, monthly workers, and odd-job workers. These hired farmers not only have no land or agricultural tools, but also have no circulating capital at all, and can only make a living by working. Their working hours are long, their wages are low, their treatment is poor, and their jobs are unstable, exceeding other workers. These people are the most difficult in the countryside and are in the same important position as poor peasants in the peasant movement.
    In addition, there are a considerable number of vagrant proletarians, who are farmers who have lost their land and handicraft workers who have lost their jobs. They are the most unstable people in human life. They have secret organizations in various places, such as the "Sanhehui" in Fujian and Guangdong, the "Gelaohui" in Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Sichuan, the "Dadaohui" in Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces, the "Zailihui" in Zhili and the three northeastern provinces, and the "Qingbang" [15] in Shanghai and other places, all of which were mutual aid groups for their political and economic struggles. Dealing with this group of people is one of China's difficult problems. This group of people can be brave and fight, but they are destructive. If they are guided properly, they can become a revolutionary force.
    In summary, it can be seen that all warlords, bureaucrats, comprador classes, large landlord classes, and a part of the reactionary intellectuals attached to them who collude with imperialism are our enemies. The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution. All semi-proletarians and petty bourgeoisie are our closest friends. The wavering middle class, its right wing may be our enemy, and its left wing may be our friend - but we must always be wary of them and not let them disrupt our ranks.
    [1] The Statists refer to a small group of fascist shameless politicians who organized the "Chinese Statist Youth League" at that time and later renamed it the "Chinese Youth Party." Their anti-revolutionary career was to oppose the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, and to receive subsidies from various reactionary factions in power and imperialism.
    [2] Dai Jitao joined the Kuomintang in his early years and once engaged in speculative business in the stock exchange with Chiang Kai-shek. After Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, he engaged in anti-communist instigation, making spiritual preparations for Chiang Kai-shek to launch a counter-revolutionary coup in 1927. For a long time, he was Chiang Kai-shek's loyal running dog in counter-revolution. In February 1949, he saw that Chiang Kai-shek's rule was about to collapse and the future was hopeless, so he committed suicide.
    [3] The Beijing "Chen Bao" was the organ of the Research Department, one of the political groups that politically supported the rule of the Northern Warlords at that time.
    [4] In 1923, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen decided to reorganize the Kuomintang, implement Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, and accommodate Communists to participate in the party. In January 1924, he convened the first National Congress of the Kuomintang in Guangzhou and determined the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrades Li Dazhao, Lin Boqu, Qu Qiubai, etc. all participated in this conference, playing a significant role in helping the Kuomintang embark on the road of revolution. They were also elected as members or alternate members of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang at that time.
    [5] Comrade Mao Zedong is referring to middle peasants here.
    [6] Zhao Gongyuan Shuai is the god of wealth in Chinese folklore, named Zhao Gongming.
    [7] In May 1925, Japanese cotton mills in Qingdao and Shanghai successively experienced worker strikes, which were large-scale and were suppressed by Japanese imperialism and its running dog, the Northern Warlords. On May 15, Shanghai Japanese cotton mill capitalists shot and killed worker Gu Zhenghong and injured more than ten workers. On the 25th, eight workers in Qingdao were slaughtered by the reactionary government. On the 30th, more than 2,000 students in Shanghai promoted support for workers in the concession, calling for the recovery of the concession. Then, more than 10,000 people gathered in front of the British concession police station, shouting slogans such as "Down with imperialism" and "All Chinese people unite." British imperialist police immediately opened fire and massacred, killing and injuring many students, which was the famous "May 30th Massacre." After this massacre occurred, it aroused public outrage throughout the country, and marches, demonstrations, strikes, school strikes, and market strikes occurred everywhere, forming an extremely large-scale anti-imperialist movement.
    [8] Comrade Mao Zedong is referring to poor peasants who are half owner-farmers and half tenant farmers here.
    [9] There are different classes of Chinese shop assistants. Comrade Mao Zedong is referring to the majority of shop assistants here; there is also a part of lower-level shop assistants who live a proletarian life.
    [10] Refers to the Hong Kong seamen's strike in early 1922 and the Yangtze River crew strike. The Hong Kong seamen's strike lasted for eight weeks. After a fierce bloody struggle, the British imperialist authorities in Hong Kong were finally forced to recognize increased wages, restore the original trade union, release arrested workers, and compensate the dead workers. The Yangtze River crew workers followed up and launched a strike, which lasted for two weeks and also achieved victory.
    [11] After the Chinese Communist Party was established in 1921, it carried out organizational work among railway workers. In 1922 and 1923, strike struggles were carried out on various major railway lines under the leadership of the Communist Party. The most famous one was the general strike held by the workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway (ie, the railway from Beijing to Hankou) on February 4, 1923, to fight for the freedom to organize a general trade union. Wu Peifu and Xiao Yaonan, the Northern Warlords supported by British imperialism, carried out a brutal massacre of striking workers on February 7, which was the historically famous "February 7 Massacre."
    [12] Kailuan Coal Mine is the general name of the Kaiping and Luanzhou coal mining areas in Hebei Province, China. They are interconnected large coal mining areas with more than 50,000 miners. British imperialism plundered the Kaiping Coal Mine during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Chinese people then formed the Luanzhou Coal Mine Company, which was later merged into the Kailuan Mining Bureau. Both mines were exclusively occupied by British imperialism. The Kailuan strike refers to the strike in October 1922. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine originally belonged to Henan Province and is located in the west of the current Pingyuan Province. It is a famous coal mining area in China. The Jiaozuo strike refers to the strike from July 1 to August 9, 1925.
    [13] Shameen was a British imperialist concession in Guangzhou at that time. In July 1924, the British imperialists who ruled Shameen promulgated a new police law stipulating that Chinese people entering and leaving the concession in Shameen must carry a license with their own photo attached, but foreigners could freely enter and leave. Shameen workers announced a strike on July 15 to protest this unreasonable measure. As a result, the British imperialists were forced to cancel the new police law.
    [14] After the Shanghai incident on May 30, 1925, the Shanghai general strike began on June 1, and the Hong Kong general strike began on June 19. The former involved more than 200,000 strikers, and the latter involved 250,000. The Hong Kong general strike, with the support of the people of the whole country, lasted for one year and four months, which was the longest strike in the history of the world's workers' movement.
    [15] Sanhehui, Gelaohui, Dadaohui, Zailihui, and Qingbang were some primitive forms of backward folk secret groups. The members of these organizations were mainly bankrupt farmers, unemployed handicraft workers, and vagrant proletarians. In the Chinese feudal era, these elements often used religious superstition as a link, and under the patriarchal organizational form, formed various organizations with different names, and some even possessed armed forces. They once used these organizations to seek mutual assistance in social life, and for a certain period of time, they used them to launch struggles to resist the bureaucrats and landlords who oppressed them. But it is clear that farmers and handicraft workers cannot find a way out from this backward organization. This backward organization is also often easily manipulated and used by the forces of landlords and local tyrants, and because they have blind destructiveness, some have become reactionary forces. When Chiang Kai-shek launched a counter-revolutionary coup in 1927, he used this backward organization as a tool to undermine the unity of the working people and undermine the revolution. When the strength of the modern industrial proletariat rose greatly, the peasants gradually formed a completely new type of organization under the leadership of the working class, and this type of primitive and backward organization lost its value of existence.

　　中国社会各阶级的分析
   （一九二六年三月）
    毛泽东
    毛泽东同志此文，是为反对当时党内存在着的两种倾向而写的。当时党内的第一种倾向，以陈独秀为代表，只注意同国民党合作，忘记了农民，这是右倾机会主义。第二种倾向，以张国焘为代表，只注意工人运动，同样忘记了农民，这是“左”倾机会主义。这两种机会主义都感觉自己力量不足，而不知道到何处去寻找力量，到何处去取得广大的同盟军。毛泽东同志指出中国无产阶级的最广大和最忠实的同盟军是农民，这样就解决了中国革命中的最主要的同盟军问题。毛泽东同志并且预见到当时的民族资产阶级是一个动摇的阶级，他们在革命高涨时将要分化，其右翼将要跑到帝国主义方面去。一九二七年所发生的事变，证明了这一点。
                          毛泽东选集出版委员会
    谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。中国过去一切革命斗争成效甚少，其基本原因就是因为不能团结真正的朋友，以攻击真正的敌人。革命党是群众的向导，在革命中未有革命党领错了路而革命不失败的。我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。我们要分辨真正的敌友，不可不将中国社会各阶级的经济地位及其对于革命的态度，作一个大概的分析。
    中国社会各阶级的情况是怎样的呢？
    地主阶级和买办阶级。经济落后的半殖民地的中国，地主阶级和买办阶级完全是国际资产阶级的附庸，其生存和发展，是附属于帝国主义的。这些阶级代表中国最落后的和最反动的生产关系，阻碍中国生产力的发展，他们和中国革命的目的完全不相容。特别是大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。其政治代表是国家主义派〔一〕和国民党右派。
    中产阶级。这个阶级代表中国资本主义的生产关系。他们对于中国革命具有矛盾的态度：他们在受外资打击、军阀压迫感觉痛苦时，需要革命，赞成反帝国主义反军阀的革命运动；但是当着革命在国内有本国无产阶级的勇猛参加，在国外有国际无产阶级的积极援助，对于其欲达到大资产阶级地位的阶级的发展感觉到威胁时，他们又怀疑革命。中产阶级即所谓民族资产阶级。其政治主张为实现民族资产阶级一阶级统治的国家。有一个自称为戴季陶〔二〕“真实信徒”的，在北京《晨报》〔三〕上发表议论说：“举起你的左手打倒帝国主义，举起你的右手打倒共产党。”这两句话，画出了这个阶级的矛盾惶遽状态。他们反对以阶级斗争学说解释国民党的民生主义，他们反对国民党联俄和容纳共产党〔四〕及左派分子。但是这个阶级的企图——实现民族资产阶级统治的国家，是完全行不通的，因为现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。这两大势力竖起了两面大旗：一面是红色的革命的大旗，第三国际高举着，号召全世界一切被压迫阶级集合于其旗帜之下；一面是白色的反革命的大旗，国际联盟高举着，号召全世界一切反革命分子集合于其旗帜之下。那些中间阶级，必定很快地分化，或者向左跑入革命派，或者向右跑入反革命派，没有他们“独立”的余地。所以，中国的中产阶级，以其本阶级为主体的“独立”革命思想，仅仅是一个幻想。
    小资产阶级。如自耕农〔五〕，手工业主，小知识阶层——学生界、中小学教员、小员司、小事务员、小律师、小商人等都属于这一类。这一个阶级，在人数上，在阶级性上，都值得大大注意。自耕农和手工业主所经营的，都是小生产的经济。这个小资产阶级内的各阶层虽然同处在小资产阶级经济地位，但有三个不同的部分。第一部分是有余钱剩米的，即用其体力或脑力劳动所得，除自给外，每年有余剩。这种人发财观念极重，对赵公元帅〔六〕礼拜最勤，虽不妄想发大财，却总想爬上中产阶级地位。他们看见那些受人尊敬的小财东，往往垂着一尺长的涎水。这种人胆子小，他们怕官，也有点怕革命。因为他们的经济地位和中产阶级颇接近，故对于中产阶级的宣传颇相信。对于革命取怀疑的态度。这一部分人在小资产阶级中占少数，是小资产阶级的右翼。第二部分是在经济上大体上可以自给的。这一部分人比较第一部分人大不相同，他们也想发财，但是赵公元帅总不让他们发财，而且因为近年以来帝国主义、军阀、封建地主、买办大资产阶级的压迫和剥削，使他们感觉现在的世界已经不是从前的世界。他们觉得现在如果只使用和从前相等的劳动，就会不能维持生活。必须增加劳动时间，每天起早散晚，对于职业加倍注意，方能维持生活。他们有点骂人了，骂洋人叫“洋鬼子”，骂军阀叫“抢钱司令”，骂土豪劣绅叫“为富不仁”，对于反帝国主义反军阀的运动，仅怀疑其未必成功（理由是：洋人和军阀的来头那末大），不肯贸然参加，取了中立的态度，但是绝不反对革命。这一部分人数甚多，大概占小资产阶级的一半。第三部分是生活下降的。这一部分人好些大概原先是所谓殷实人家，渐渐变得仅仅可以保住，渐渐变得生活下降了。他们每逢年终结账一次，就吃惊一次，说：“咳，又亏了！”这种人因为他们过去过着好日子，后来逐年下降，负债渐多，渐次过着凄凉的日子，“瞻念前途，不寒而栗”。这种人在精神上感觉的痛苦很大，因为他们有一个从前和现在相反的比较。这种人在革命运动中颇要紧，是一个数量不小的群众，是小资产阶级的左翼。以上所说小资产阶级的三部分，对于革命的态度，在平时各不相同；但到战时，即到革命潮流高涨，可以看得见胜利的曙光时，不但小资产阶级的左派参加革命，中派亦可参加革命，即右派分子受了无产阶级和小资产阶级左派的革命大潮所裹挟，也只得附合着革命。我们从一九二五年的五卅运动〔七〕和各地农民运动的经验看来，这个断定是不错的。
    半无产阶级。此处所谓半无产阶级，包含：（一）绝大部分半自耕农〔八〕，（二）贫农，（三）小手工业者，（四）店员〔九〕，（五）小贩等五种。绝大部分半自耕农和贫农是农村中一个数量极大的群众。所谓农民问题，主要就是他们的问题。半自耕农、贫农和小手工业者所经营的，都是更细小的小生产的经济。大部分半自耕农和贫农虽同属半无产阶级，但在经济状况仍有上、中、下三个细别。半自耕农，其生活苦于自耕农，因其食粮每年大约有一半不够，须租别人田地，或者出卖一部分劳动力，或经营小商，以资弥补。春夏之间，青黄不接，高利向别人借债，重价向别人籴粮，较之自耕农的无求于人，自然景遇要苦，但是优于贫农。因为贫农无土地，每年耕种只得收获之一半或不足一半；半自耕农则租于别人的部分虽只收获一半或不足一半，然自有的部分却可全得。故半自耕农的革命性优于自耕农而不及贫农。贫农是农村中的佃农，受地主的剥削。其经济地位又分两部分。一部分贫农有比较充足的农具和相当数量的资金。此种农民，每年劳动结果，自己可得一半。不足部分，可以种杂粮、捞鱼虾、饲鸡豕、或出卖一部分劳动力勉强维持生活，于艰难竭蹶之中，存聊以卒岁之想。故其生活苦于半自耕农，然较另一部分贫农为优。其革命性，则优于半自耕农而不及另一部分贫农。所谓另一部分贫农，则既无充足的农具，又无资金，肥料不足，土地歉收，送租之外，所得无几，更需要出卖一部分劳动力；荒时暴月，向亲友乞哀告怜，借得几斗几升，敷衍三日五日，债务丛集，如牛负重。他们是农民中极艰苦者，极易接受革命的宣传。小手工业者所以称为半无产阶级，是因为他们虽然自有简单的生产手段，且系一种自由职业，但他们也常常被迫出卖一部分劳动力，其经济地位略与农村中的贫农相当。因其家庭负担之重，工资与生活物价之不相称，时有贫困的压迫和失业的恐慌，与贫农亦大致相同。店员是商店的雇员，以微薄的薪资，供家庭的费用，物价年年增长，薪给往往须数年一增，偶与此辈倾谈，便见叫苦不迭。其地位和贫农及小手工业者不相上下，对于革命宣传极易接受。小贩不论肩挑叫卖，或街畔摊售，总之本小利微，吃着不够。其地位和贫农不相上下，其需要一个变更现状的革命，也和贫农相同。
    无产阶级。现代工业无产阶级约二百万。中国因经济落后，故现代工业无产阶级不多。二百万左右的产业工人中，主要为铁路、矿山、海运、纺织、造船五种产业，而其中很大一个数量是在外资产业的奴役下。工业无产阶级人数虽不多，却是中国新的生产力的代表者，是近代中国最进步的阶级，做了革命运动的领导力量。我们看四年以来的罢工运动，如海员罢工〔一○〕、铁路罢工〔一一〕、开滦和焦作煤矿罢工〔一二〕、沙面罢工〔一三〕、以及“五卅”后上海香港两处的大罢工〔一四〕所表现的力量，就可知工业无产阶级在中国革命中所处地位的重要。他们所以能如此，第一个原因是集中。无论那种人都不如他们的集中。第二个原因是经济地位低下。他们失了生产手段，剩下两手，绝了发财的望，又受着帝国主义军阀资产阶级的极残酷的待遇，所以他们特别能战斗。都市苦力工人的力量也很可注意。以码头搬运夫和人力车夫占多数，粪夫清道夫等亦属于这一类。他们除双手外，别无长物，其经济地位和产业工人相似，惟不及产业工人的集中和在生产上的重要。中国尚少新式的资本主义的农业。所谓农村无产阶级，是指长工、月工、零工等雇农而言。此等雇农不仅无土地，无农具，又无丝毫流动资金，只得营工度日。其劳动时间之长，工资之少，待遇之薄，职业之不安定，超过其他工人。此种人在乡村中是最感困难者，在农民运动中和贫农处于同一紧要的地位。
    此外，还有数量不少的游民无产者，为失了土地的农民和失了工作机会的手工业工人。他们是人类生活中最不安定者。他们在各地都有秘密组织，如闽粤的“三合会”，湘鄂黔蜀的“哥老会”，皖豫鲁等省的“大刀会”，直隶及东三省的“在理会”，上海等处的“青帮”〔一五〕，都曾经是他们的政治和经济斗争的互助团体。处置这一批人，是中国的困难的问题之一。这一批人很能勇敢奋斗，但有破坏性，如引导得法，可以变成一种革命力量。
    综上所述，可知一切勾结帝国主义的军阀、官僚、买办阶级、大地主阶级以及附属于他们的一部分反动知识界，是我们的敌人。工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量。一切半无产阶级、小资产阶级，是我们最接近的朋友。那动摇不定的中产阶级，其右翼可能是我们的敌人，其左翼可能是我们的朋友——但我们要时常提防他们，不要让他们扰乱了我们的阵线。
    〔一〕国家主义派，指当时组织“中国国家主义青年团”后来又改名“中国青年党”的一小撮法西斯主义的无耻政客。他们以反对共产党和反对苏联、而向各种当权的反动派及帝国主义领取津贴为其反革命的职业。
    〔二〕戴季陶，早年参加国民党，曾经和蒋介石共同经营交易所的投机事业。一九二五年孙中山逝世之后，他即从事于反共的煽惑工作，为蒋介石在一九二七年举行反革命政变作了精神上的准备。在长期中，他都是蒋介石反革命的忠实走狗。一九四九年二月，他看到蒋介石的统治即将崩溃，前途已经绝望，因而自杀。
    〔三〕北京《晨报》为当时在政治上拥护北洋军阀统治的政团之一——研究系的机关报。
    〔四〕一九二三年，孙中山在中国共产党的帮助下，决定改组国民党，实行国共合作，容纳共产党人参加该党，并于一九二四年一月在广州召集国民党第一次全国代表大会，确定联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策。当时毛泽东同志和李大钊、林伯渠、瞿秋白等同志均参加了这个大会，对于帮助国民党走上革命的道路，起了重大的作用。他们并被选为当时国民党的中央执行委员或候补执行委员。
    〔五〕毛泽东同志在这里是指中农。
    〔六〕赵公元帅是中国民间传说的财神，叫赵公明。
    〔七〕一九二五年五月间，青岛上海各地日本纱厂先后发生工人罢工的斗争，规模很大，遭受日本帝国主义及其走狗北洋军阀的镇压。五月十五日上海日本纱厂资本家枪杀工人顾正红，伤工人十余。二十五日青岛工人被反动政府屠杀八人。三十日上海学生二千余人在租界内宣传声援工人，号召收回租界，随后集合群众万余人在英租界捕房门首，高呼“打倒帝国主义”和“全中国人民团结起来”等口号。英帝国主义巡捕旋即放枪屠杀，死伤许多学生，是为著名的“五卅惨案”。这个大屠杀事件发生后，即引起全国人民的公愤，到处发生游行示威、罢工、罢课和罢市，形成极大规模的反帝国主义运动。
    〔八〕毛泽东同志在这里是指半自耕半租佃的贫苦农民。
    〔九〕中国店员有不同的阶层。毛泽东同志在这里所指的，在店员中比较占多数；还有一部分下层店员则是过着无产阶级的生活。
    〔一○〕指一九二二年初的香港海员罢工和长江船员的罢工。香港海员罢工坚持了八个星期，经过激烈的流血的斗争，最后香港英帝国主义当局被迫承认增加工资，恢复原工会，释放被捕工人，抚恤死难工人。长江船员工人继起发动罢工，坚持两星期，也得到胜利。
    〔一一〕中国共产党在一九二一年建立后，就在铁路工人中进行组织工作，在一九二二年和一九二三年，各个主要铁路线上，都在共产党领导下有过罢工斗争。最有名的一次，是一九二三年二月四日京汉铁路（即北京到汉口的铁路）工人们为争取组织总工会的自由而举行的总罢工。在英帝国主义支持下的北洋军阀吴佩孚、萧耀南，在二月七日对罢工工人实行了残酷的屠杀，是为历史上有名的“二七惨案”。
    〔一二〕开滦煤矿，是开平滦州两个煤矿区的总称，在中国的河北省，是互相联系的大煤矿区，矿工五万余人。英帝国主义在一九○○年义和团运动时候掠夺了开平煤矿，中国人乃另组滦州煤矿公司，后来又并入开滦矿务总局，两矿都为英帝国主义所独占。开滦罢工，是指一九二二年十月间的罢工。焦作煤矿原属河南省，在现在平原省的西部，是中国著名的煤矿区。焦作罢工，是指一九二五年七月一日至八月九日的罢工。
    〔一三〕沙面当时是英帝国主义在广州的租借地。一九二四年七月，统治沙面的英帝国主义者，颁布一新警律，规定沙面中国人出入租界，必须携带贴有本人像片的执照，但外国人却可自由出入。沙面工人于七月十五日宣布罢工，抗议这个无理措施。结果英帝国主义者被迫取消了新警律。
    〔一四〕一九二五年五月三十日的上海事件后，六月一日开始上海总罢工，六月十九日开始香港总罢工。前者参加罢工的人数为二十余万，后者为二十五万。香港大罢工在全国人民的支援下，坚持了一年零四个月，是世界工人运动史中最长的一次罢工。
    〔一五〕三合会、哥老会、大刀会、在理会、青帮，是一些原始形式的落后的民间秘密团体，这些组织的组成分子主要的是破产农民、失业手工业者、流氓无产者等。在中国封建时代，这类成份常常以宗教迷信为联系纽带，而在家长制的组织形式下，形成种种名目不同的组织，有的还拥有武装。他们曾经用过这种组织去求在社会生活中的互相援助，并在一定时期中曾经用以发动斗争，去反抗压迫他们的官僚和地主。但很显然，农民和手工业者是不可能从这种落后性的组织中得到出路的。这种落后性的组织又往往容易被地主豪强势力所操纵和利用，加上他们带有盲目的破坏性，因此有的就变成了反动的力量。一九二七年蒋介石举行反革命政变的时候，曾经利用过这种落后的组织作为破坏劳动人民团结和破坏革命的工具。当近代工业无产阶级的力量盛大兴起以后，农民在工人阶级领导之下逐步地形成了完全新式的组织，这类原始的落后的组织就失掉了它们的存在价值。
