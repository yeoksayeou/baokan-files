　　Editor's Note: The East China Bureau and Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC Central Committee achieved great results by organizing and leading reporting officers to report on the history of the Chinese Communist Party to CPC members and the masses around "July 1st." This proves that the reporting officer system is entirely correct and of great significance. In the future, Party organizations in various regions should, in accordance with the central government's regulations on establishing a reporting officer system, organize reporting officers to conduct various political propaganda to the broad masses.
　　Around "July 1st," the East China Bureau and Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC Central Committee organized and led the reporting officers of the East China regional-level organs and Shanghai municipal and district-level organs in Shanghai, with a planned and unified assignment to major factories, schools, and enterprises throughout the city, to report on the history of the Chinese Communist Party to the broad masses of CPC members and the masses, achieving good results.
　　In the week around "July 1st," the reporting officers who conducted reports on the history of the Chinese Communist Party at various meetings included Alternate Member of the CPC Central Committee Liu Xiao, Liu Changsheng, Secretary-General of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Wei Wenbo, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department Feng Ding, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department Hu Lijiao, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC Li Yu, Minister of Organization Wang Yaoshan, and 177 others. They made more than 260 reports on the history of the Chinese Communist Party, of which more than 100 were conducted in factories. The number of people who listened to the reports totaled more than 350,000, of which more than 260,000 were workers, nearly 30,000 were students and teachers, and the rest were cadres from organs and some people from industry and commerce, cadres from the local organizations of various democratic parties in East China and Shanghai, as well as activists from women and neighborhood residents. Before giving their reports, the reporting officers studied relevant documents and materials in detail, understood the audience's ideological situation, and wrote out lecture outlines. For example, reporting officers Wei Wenbo and Hu Lijiao inquired about the situation from the CPC branch secretaries of the respective units before giving their reports, and reporting officers Zhang Luofu and Jiang Wen went to the factories themselves to understand the ideological situation of the workers and the requirements of the CPC branches for the Party history reports. Reporting officer Liu Changsheng and others, after reporting to Party members and the masses, also put forward specific suggestions for improving future work. When reporting officers went to factories, schools, and enterprises to give reports, they were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. After listening to the reports, the workers of many units launched discussions. For example, the workers of the British & Chinese Corporation Shipyard organized group discussions after listening to the report on the history of the Chinese Communist Party. They also requested that the CPC branch and trade union of the factory regularly hold study classes to learn political theory and cultural knowledge. Cadres of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and other organs improved their enthusiasm for studying Party history after listening to the report on the history of the Chinese Communist Party. After listening to the report on the history of the Chinese Communist Party, general new Party members and mass activists gained a further understanding of the Chinese revolution and Chairman Mao's correct leadership. Many workers said after listening to the report: "The Communist Party's thirty years of arduous struggle are for us workers." In various factories in the Yangshupu district, many worker activists, after listening to the report on the history of the Chinese Communist Party, requested to join the Party. After listening to the reports, the broad masses of workers generally assured the CPC branches that they would do a good job in the patriotic increase production and donation campaign.
　　The East China region and Shanghai reporting officers achieved great results in reporting on the history of the Chinese Communist Party. The first reason for these achievements is the importance attached to it by the CPC committees at all levels. Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, first made a report on Party history at the cadre meeting, which aroused the attention of all reporting officers and laid a good foundation for carrying out the reporting work. The second is to organize responsible cadres of various organs to go to grassroots units to make reports. On the one hand, this can meet the urgent needs of Party members and concentrated industrial workers and other people; at the same time, it also provides responsible Party cadres with the opportunity to get close to the masses. This is of great significance for strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses; and it prepares good conditions for establishing a regular reporting officer system in the future. Third, there should be unified regulations on the content of the report. The reporting officer should also determine the content of the report based on the specific circumstances of each unit. The reporting officers of East China and Shanghai mainly used Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" and the report of Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau, as the main materials, and the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau also compiled and printed an outline of the Party history report for the reporting officers to refer to. The reporting officers contacted each unit in advance to understand the situation, so many reporting officers were able to combine practical problems when reporting, making the content of the report more specific and rich. Fourth, the reporting officer must be unifiedly organized and distributed by the local Party committee, and various work systems must be specifically formulated. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC studied the requirements of the district committees for reporting officers and report content in advance, and uniformly distributed them according to the number and characteristics of the reporting officers. In addition, a reporting officer card system should be established in the work. After the reporting officer reports, fill out a report form and report to the Party committee; the listening unit must also seriously collect the audience's feedback and report the audience's opinions to the Party committee and the reporting officer. This approach can not only understand the effect of the reporting officer's report, but also serve as a reference for improving future work.

### 中共中央华东局暨上海市委会  组织报告员报告党史获很大效果

　　中共中央华东局暨上海市委会
    组织报告员报告党史获很大效果
    编者按：中共中央华东局暨上海市委会，在“七一”前后组织和领导报告员向中共党员及群众报告中共党史收到很大效果，这证明报告员制度是完全正确的，有重大意义的。今后各地党的组织应按照中央关于建立报告员制度的规定，组织报告员向广大群众进行各种政治宣传。
    中共中央华东局暨上海市委员会于“七一”前后组织和领导在上海的华东区一级机关和上海市、区级机关的报告员，有计划地统一分配到全市主要工厂、学校和企业单位，向广大的中共党员和群众作有关中国共产党党史的报告，收到很好的效果。
    “七一”前后一周内，在各种会议上进行中国共产党党史报告的报告员有中共中央候补委员刘晓、刘长胜、中共中央华东局秘书长魏文伯、宣传部副部长冯定、组织部副部长胡立教、中共上海市委会秘书长黎玉、组织部长王尧山等一百七十七名。他们作了有关中共党史的报告二百六十多次，其中有一百多次是深入到工厂中去报告的。听报告的人数共达三十五万以上，其中职工占二十六万多人，学生教师近三万人，其余为机关干部和一部分工商界、各民主党派在华东与上海的地方组织的干部，以及妇女、里弄居民中的积极分子等。报告员作报告前都先详细地研究了有关文件和材料，了解听众的思想情况，写出讲演提纲。如报告员魏文伯、胡立教等都在报告前向各该单位的中共支部书记了解情况，报告员张洛甫、江文等更亲自到工厂里去了解职工群众思想情况和中共党支部对党史报告的要求。报告员刘长胜等在向党员和群众作报告后，并提出了今后改进工作的具体意见。报告员深入到工厂、学校和企业单位作报告时，受到各界人民群众热烈的欢迎。许多单位的职工听了报告之后，展开讨论。如英联船厂的工人们听了中共党史报告后纷纷组织小组讨论。他们并要求该厂中共支部与工会能经常办学习班，学习政治理论与文化知识。上海市人民政府等机关干部听了中共党史报告后，提高了对学习党史的热情。一般新党员和群众积极分子听了中共党史报告后，对中国革命和毛主席的正确领导都有了进一步的认识。许多工人听了报告后说：“共产党三十年来艰苦斗争，就是为了我们工人。”杨树浦区的各个工厂中，许多工人积极分子听了中共党史报告后，纷纷要求入党。广大工人群众听了报告后，普遍向中共支部保证，搞好爱国增产捐献运动。
    华东区和上海市报告员报告中共党史收到很大的效果。这些成绩的获得第一是由于中共各级党委的重视。中共中央华东局书记饶漱石首先在干部大会上作了党史报告，引起了全体报告员的重视，为开展报告工作打下很好的基础。第二是组织各机关党员负责干部到基层单位去作报告。这样一方面可以满足党员与集中的产业工人及其他人民群众的迫切要求；同时也使负责的党员干部有接近群众的机会。这对加强党与群众的联系有极重大的意义；并为今后建立经常的报告员制度准备了很好的条件。第三、报告内容要有统一的规定。报告员并应根据各单位的具体情况，确定报告内容。华东和上海市的报告员以胡乔木的《中国共产党的三十年》和华东局书记饶漱石的报告为主要材料，华东局宣传部并编印了党史报告提纲，供报告员参考。报告员事先都与各单位联系，了解情况，因而许多报告员在报告时便能结合实际问题，使报告内容更加具体丰富。第四、报告员必须由当地党委统一组织和分配，并具体订出各种工作制度。中共上海市委员会事先研究了各区委提出的对报告员与报告内容的要求，按照报告员的数量和特点来统一分配。此外在工作中要建立报告员卡片制度。在报告员报告后填写汇报表，向党委汇报；听讲单位也须认真收集听众反映，向党委和报告员汇报听众的意见。这种作法一方面可以了解报告员报告的效果，同时可作为今后改进工作的参考。
