Handan Prefecture's Model Village for Selling and Storing Cotton—Shangquan Village, Wu'an County
Cotton Farmers Write to Chairman Mao Reporting on Cotton Sales and Storage
And Guarantee to Increase Cotton Production This Year to Better Meet the Needs of Industrial Production.

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　We are the 630 cotton farming households of Shangquan Village, Wu'an County, Hebei Province. We have responded to the call of the Party and the government by selling all of our stored cotton, 132,000 jin (seed cotton), to the state or storing it in state economic organs. We are very grateful to the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Wu'an County People's Government for giving us the glorious title of "Model Village for Selling and Storing Cotton."

　　We understand that enthusiastically selling and storing cotton for the country is precisely our duty. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek desperately shipped the surplus raw cotton of his American Daddy to China, earning the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. At that time, we could only exchange 100 jin of cotton for 80 or 90 jin of millet. In a word, at that time, no matter what we planted, it was never enough for the exploitation of landlords and reactionary governments, we could never eat our fill or keep warm, and we had no interest in planting anything. Now we have turned over, and we have become masters of the country. When our own textile factories lack cotton and cannot start work, so that we may not be able to wear fine cloth, and prices may fluctuate as a result, what reason do we have to keep our own cotton instead of taking it out?

　　The plows and harrows we hold in our hands, the cloth we wear on our bodies, and the pots and bowls we use at home are all made by our worker brothers. Without industrial production, our lives would be hopeless. Furthermore, our People's Government, in order to encourage us farmers and worker brothers to jointly carry out the country's economic construction, has stipulated reasonable cotton-grain price ratios and the policy of collecting agricultural taxes in cotton-growing areas once in the autumn, which has made it possible for us cotton farmers to improve our lives. Now we have no worries about food, we want to buy more production tools, we want to buy fine cloth to make clothes, we want to buy rubber shoes, we want to buy flashlights, soap, bicycles... All of these are inseparable from industrial production and from our worker brothers.

　　We are very satisfied and grateful for the government's care and encouragement for us cotton farmers. Through such concrete matters, we can better understand the close relationship between our country and us, and we also feel more that we must cherish our country. Now that American imperialism wants to invade our beloved country, we cotton farmers must grow more and better cotton to supply the country, strengthen the country's economic strength, and strike at American imperialism.

　　Respected Chairman Mao: In 1945, our entire village only planted more than 2,000 mu of cotton. This year, we have planted 10,300 mu of cotton. Last year, we harvested 120 jin of cotton per mu. This year, we must make it 130 jin per mu. We have our own land, we have plenty of labor, and we have your correct leadership. We will definitely grow more and better cotton to meet the needs of the country's industrial production.

　　邯郸专区售棉储棉模范村—武安上泉村
　  棉农写信向毛主席报告售棉储棉情况
　  并保证提高今年棉花产量，更多满足工业生产的需要。敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是河北省武安县上泉村的六百三十户棉农。我们响应了党和政府的号召，把我们所有的存棉十三万二千斤（籽棉）全部卖给国家，或储存到国家的经济机关了。我们很感谢邯郸专署和武安县人民政府给我们“售储棉花模范村”的光荣称号。
    我们懂得，踊跃向国家售储棉花正是我们的义务。在国民党反动统治时期，蒋介石拚命地把他美国洋爸爸的剩余原棉运到中国来，赚去咱们中国人民的血汗。那时我们种下一百斤棉只换到八、九十斤小米。一句话，那时种什么也是不够地主和反动政府剥削的，种什么也吃不饱穿不暖，种什么也没有兴趣。现在我们翻身了，我们当了国家的主人。当我们自己的纺织工厂缺少棉花开不了工，因之我们也就有可能穿不上细布，而且物价有可能因此波动的时候，我们还有什么理由留着自己的棉花不拿出去呢？
    咱们手里拿的犁、耙，咱们身上穿的布匹，咱们家里用的锅、碗，都是工人老大哥制造的，离了工业生产，咱们的生活就没有指望了。再说：咱们人民政府，为了鼓励我们农民和工人兄弟一道搞好国家的经济建设，规定了合理的棉粮比价和棉区农业税秋后一次征收等政策，这样就使我们棉农有了改善生活的可能。现在我们吃的不愁了，我们要买更多的生产工具，我们要买细布做衣服，我们要买胶鞋、要买手电筒、肥皂、自行车……。这些都离不开工业生产，离不开工人老大哥。
    我们很满意也很感谢政府对我们棉农的照顾和鼓励。通过这样的具体事情，我们更能认识到我们国家和我们的密切关系了，我们也更感到要爱护我们的国家。现在美帝国主义想侵略我们可爱的国家，我们棉农，一定要种出更多更好的棉花供给国家，增强国家的经济力量，打击美帝国主义。
    敬爱的毛主席：一九四五年，我们全村只种了二千多亩棉花，今年我们种了一万○三百亩棉花。去年我们一亩棉收了一百二十斤，今年我们一定要叫他每亩收到一百三十斤。我们有了自己的土地，我们有的是劳力，我们又有您的正确领导，我们一定会种出更多更好的棉花，满足国家工业生产的需要。
