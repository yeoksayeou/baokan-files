Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 1st: The people of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province – the hometown of Chairman Mao – solemnly gathered on "July 1st" to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. On this day, the entire township was filled with joy and excitement. Slogans celebrating "July 1st" and calling for donations for the "Mao Zedong Hometown" airplane were posted everywhere. A week before, the people of Shaoshan Township had been eagerly preparing to welcome "July 1st." People had held village meetings for days to study the glorious 30-year struggle history of the Chinese Communist Party, discuss the changes in their lives before and after liberation, and review and revise patriotic covenants.

At 11:00 AM on "July 1st," more than 1,500 people from various villages gathered at the venue near Chairman Mao's former residence, which had been decorated in advance. After the celebration began, the entire venue was filled with the sound of gongs and drums. At the meeting, the representative of the Shaoshan branch of the Chinese Communist Party reported on the main work of the past year. Then, representatives from various units reported on the important gains they had made in their work and study under the leadership of the branch over the past year. Mao Jisheng, the representative of the cooperative, spoke about the work achievements of the cooperative in the past six months since its establishment, and expressed that he would run the cooperative even better under the leadership of the branch in the future. The Mao Renqiu mutual aid team introduced the benefits of "getting organized" under the guidance of Chairman Mao. During the study in preparation for "July 1st," the Mao Renqiu mutual aid team also revised the patriotic covenant, deciding to strengthen water conservancy management, plant more early-maturing crops, help the families of soldiers solve difficulties, and regularly study current events, and strive to increase the yield of each mu of land by fifty catties of rice, three-tenths of which would be used to participate in the donation campaign for the "Mao Zedong Hometown" airplane. After discussion by the masses present, the conference also revised the patriotic covenant of the entire township, and passed a resolution to write a letter to Chairman Mao to report on the new life of the past year.

In order to ensure the implementation of the patriotic covenant, the Shaoshan Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League Branch held a forum for party members and League members after the celebration to specifically study detailed methods for leading the masses to implement the patriotic covenant in the future.

　　毛主席故乡韶山人民热烈庆祝党的卅周年
    【新华社长沙一日电】毛主席故乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山乡人民，于“七一”隆重集会庆祝中国共产党成立三十周年。这天，全乡人民都充沛着欢欣和振奋的情绪。到处张贴着庆祝“七一”和响应捐献“毛泽东故乡号”飞机的标语。一周前，韶山乡人民就以迫不及待的心情筹备迎接“七一”。人们曾连日分村集会学习中国共产党三十年的光荣斗争史、座谈解放前后的生活变化和检查修订爱国公约。
    “七一”上午十一时，各村一千五百多人齐集预先布置在毛主席故居近旁的会场上。庆祝大会开始后，全场锣鼓喧天。会上，中国共产党韶山支部代表报告了一年来的主要工作，接着，各单位代表都报告了一年来在支部领导下工作和学习上的重要收获。合作社代表毛继生谈了合作社成立后半年多来的工作成绩后，表示今后要在支部领导下，把合作社办得更好。毛仁秋互助组介绍了在毛主席指示下“组织起来”的好处。在迎接“七一”的学习中，毛仁秋互助组还修订了爱国公约，决定加强水利管理、多种早熟作物、帮助军人家属解决困难和经常学习时事，并争取每亩田增产五十斤稻谷，将其中十分之三用来参加“毛泽东故乡号”飞机的捐献运动。经到会群众讨论后，大会又修订了全乡的爱国公约，通过给毛主席写信，报告一年来的新生活。
    为了使爱国公约贯彻执行，中国共产党韶山乡支部及青年团支部在庆祝大会结束后，召开了党员、团员座谈会，具体研究了今后领导群众执行爱国公约的详细办法。
