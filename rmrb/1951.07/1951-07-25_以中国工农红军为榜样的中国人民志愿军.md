　　The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Taking the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as a Model
　　Yang Hongli
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army often uses the spirit of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Agrarian Revolutionary War—hard work, heroic fighting, and love for the people—to encourage and educate themselves.
    After entering Korea, because there were few houses, they camped in pine forests almost every day. Although it was the dead of winter and the ground was covered with snow, they did not complain. One unit marched more than 100 li in one night and arrived at a small village near Hongcheon at dawn. Upon entering the village, they saw that there were only three or five households, not enough to accommodate so many troops, so some people volunteered to stay on the mountain. It was very cold, and there was still snow on the hillside, but they said, "When Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu led the Red Army in Jinggangshan, they wore single layers of clothing even in the dead of winter; we have thick cotton clothes, so we should be much warmer than the Red Army!" Everyone gathered fallen pine needles from the ground to lay under themselves, borrowed two bundles of straw from the villagers to cover themselves, and fell sound asleep.
    One unit was pursuing the enemy and climbed three large mountains from Yangde to Goksan County. The mountains were high and the slopes were steep, and the snow was so deep that it covered their knees. Just as they were getting tired, one comrade shouted, "Hey! We're climbing a snowy mountain too!" The phrase "climbing a snowy mountain" immediately cheered everyone up: "Right! Let's learn from the heroes of our motherland—the Red Army of the 25,000-Li Long March—and add another glorious page to the history of our motherland!" When going downhill, the pack animals slipped and couldn't walk, so the people carried their loads on their backs, repaired the road with pickaxes, and laid down quilts and coats to let the animals pass.
    During the Fourth Campaign, the troops pursued the enemy and advanced very quickly. Food couldn't be transported in time, so everyone squatted in the fortifications on the mountain tops eating fried flour. At this time, someone told the story of the Old Red Army crossing the grasslands: "For hundreds of miles, the grasslands were uninhabited, sleeping on the aquatic plants, eating grass roots, wild vegetables, and belts..." Other comrades chimed in: "The Old Red Army endured so much hardship to liberate the people of our motherland. What does it matter if we endure this little bit of hardship for the sake of the happiness of our motherland, Korea, and the people of the whole world!"
    Zhou Tianyi, a Communist Party member of a certain unit, often encouraged the entire squad and himself with the story of the Old Red Army's Long March. On the march, he often carried the machine gun and the guns of the sick, despite the fact that the blisters on his feet had become festered. When camping, he also dug air-raid shelters for the sick and other comrades. He let others sleep first, boiled water, and then gently woke up the comrades to drink water or wash their feet, and dried their shoes and socks that had been soaked by snow and water. He said: "The Long March of the Old Red Army was so arduous! Now everyone says it's glorious to mention it. Isn't it equally glorious if we can overcome difficulties and complete our tasks now?" Under his leadership, the whole squad became a model squad for combat marching.
    The "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" of the Red Army are also in the Volunteer Army. Every comrade consciously abides by them and puts forward the slogan of "Protecting every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea." Whenever the troops are stationed, they immediately fetch water, chop firewood, cut grass, and sweep the floor for the landlords, doing all kinds of work and being as close to the Korean people as family. One day, one squad of a certain unit had no food to eat. They walked more than 100 li on an empty stomach at night. When camping, they saw a pot of hot sweet potatoes in a villager's house. Although the landlord was not at home at the time, everyone tightened their belts and no one ate a bite. During the Battle of Ningbian, the guard company of a certain unit accidentally caused a fire while cooking, burning down two thatched houses of a villager; they wanted to compensate at the time, but the landlord was not at home, and the troops had to continue to advance. After the troops advanced to the vicinity of Yangde, the political department of the unit sent a cadre to walk back hundreds of miles to apologize and compensate the landlord. These things were praised by the local people.
    In battle, the Volunteer Army often takes the outstanding battle examples of the Old Red Army as a model. When breaking through the 38th parallel, the terrain at the breakthrough point of a certain unit was extremely dangerous. The enemy built fortifications on high mountains. The mountains were high, the snow was deep, and it was steep and slippery. The only small road was also tightly blocked by the enemy's firepower. Because it was mountainous, the artillery was also inconvenient to cooperate with the forced attack. The commanders and fighters said, "Let's have a breakthrough at 'Lazikou'!" (Lazikou is an extremely dangerous pass on the border of Sichuan and Gansu, guarded by two regiments of the enemy. In September 1935, the northward Red Army used leggings twisted into several long ropes by more than 30 assault soldiers and bravely climbed the cliffs and high mountains to attack the enemy's flanks and defeat the enemy). So the assault team put on straw sandals, carried ropes, and climbed to the top of the mountain from the cliffs and dense forests that the enemy did not pay much attention to, and successfully launched a surprise attack. The powerful follow-up troops took advantage of the enemy's confusion and swarmed up the small road, breaking through the enemy's line of defense.
    In the Fifth Campaign, the Volunteer Army fought many beautiful battles with the same heroic spirit as the Old Red Army's Red First Regiment in defending Sanmiao Ridge (The Battle of Sanmiao Ridge was a glorious battle in which the Red Army defeated more with less in the counter-encirclement and suppression campaign. The Red First Regiment resisted three divisions of 15,000 enemies with more than 400 people, defeated nine enemy assaults, and annihilated more than 1,500 enemies.). They often resisted an enemy regiment with one platoon, and an enemy battalion with one squad, exchanging great victories at a very small price. The Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in those years was poorly equipped, but it defeated the Kuomintang bandit army, which was superior to itself in quantity and equipment. Now, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are also using inferior equipment to defeat the American aggressor army, which possesses modern equipment.

### 以中国工农红军为榜样的中国人民志愿军

　　以中国工农红军为榜样的中国人民志愿军
　　杨弘立
    中国人民志愿军经常以土地革命战争中的中国工农红军艰苦奋斗、英勇善战和热爱人民的精神，来鼓励和教育自己。
    他们入朝以后，因为房子少，几乎天天都在松树林里露营，虽然数九寒天遍地积雪，但他们并不叫苦。某部一夜走了一百多里，天明赶到洪川附近一个小村，进村一看，只有三、五户人家，住不下许多部队，一部分人便自动要求住在山上。天气很冷，山坡上还有积雪，可是他们说：“毛主席朱总司令领导的红军在井岗山时，十冬腊月还穿着单衣；咱们有厚厚的棉衣，比红军该暖和得多呢！”大家把落在地上的松针集拢来铺在身下，从老乡家里借了两捆稻草盖在身上，就呼噜呼噜睡着了。
    某部追击敌人，从阳德到谷山郡爬了三座大山，山高坡陡，雪深，一陷就没了膝盖。正爬得累的时候，有一个同志喊道：“嗨！咱们这也是爬雪山！”“爬雪山”这个字眼使大家立即振奋起来：“对！向祖国的英雄——二万五千里长征的红军学习，给咱们祖国的历史再添上光辉的一页！”下坡时，牲口滑得不能走，人便背起东西，用铁镐修路，把被子、大衣铺上，让牲口过去。
    在第四次战役时，部队追击敌人，进展很快，粮食一时运不上来，大家蹲在山头上的工事里吃炒面。这时有人讲起了老红军过草地的故事：“茫茫数百里，草地上漫无人烟，睡在水草上，吃草根、野菜、皮带。……”旁的同志也答了腔：“老红军为了祖国人民求解放，吃了那么多的苦，咱们为了祖国、朝鲜和全世界人民的幸福，吃这点苦算什么！”
    某部共产党员周田义，常以老红军长征的故事勉励全班，勉励自己。行军路上，他不顾自己脚上的水泡已经化脓，经常扛着机关枪和病号的枪。宿营时他还给病号和别的同志挖防空洞。他让别人先睡，自己烧开了水，然后轻轻唤醒同志们喝水或洗脚，并替别人烤干被雪、水浸湿了的鞋袜。他说：“老红军长征多艰苦！现在提起来谁都说光荣。眼下咱们能克服困难完成任务，不是同样光荣吗？”全班在他的带领下，成了战斗行军的模范班。
    志愿军各部队里也有“三大纪律八项注意”，每个同志都自觉遵守，并提出“爱护朝鲜一山、一水、一草、一木”的口号。部队每逢住下以后，立即给房东挑水、打柴、铡草、扫地，什么活都干，和朝鲜人民亲如一家。某部一个班有一天没吃饭，晚上饿着肚子走了一百多里路，宿营时在老乡家里看见一锅热白薯，虽然当时房东没在家，可是大伙紧了紧腰带，谁也没吃一口。某部警卫连在宁边战斗时因做饭不小心，失火烧了老乡两间草房；当时本想赔偿，但房东不在家，部队又要继续前进。部队进到阳德附近，该部政治处又派干事走回来几百里路，向房东赔偿道歉。这些事都受到当地人民的称赞。
    在战斗中，志愿军也常把老红军的出色战例作为榜样。突破三八线时，某部突破点的地形极其险要。敌人把工事建筑在高山上，山高雪深，又陡又滑，仅有的一条小路，也被敌人的火力严密封锁。因为是山地，炮兵也不便配合强攻。指战员便说：“咱们也来个突破‘腊子口’吧！”（腊子口在川甘交界，是一个极险要的隘口，敌人有二个团的兵力把守。一九三五年九月，北上红军以三十多名突击手用绑腿带拧成数条长绳，英勇地爬上峭壁高山，袭击敌人侧背，将敌击溃）。于是突击队穿上草鞋，带着绳子，从敌人不太注意的峭壁莽林之间，攀登山顶，一举奇袭成功。强大的后续部队趁敌混乱之际，从小路蜂涌而上，将敌防线突破。
    第五次战役中，志愿军以老红军红一团坚守三岬嶂（三岬嶂战斗是红军在反五次围攻中以少胜多的光辉战例。红一团以四百余人，抗击敌三个师一万五千人，打垮敌九次冲锋，歼敌一千五百余人。）一样的英雄气概，打了许多漂亮仗。他们经常以一个排抗击敌人一个团，一个小组抗击敌人一个营，以极小代价，换取重大的胜利。当年的中国工农红军装备很差，但是战胜了数量上、装备上均优于自己的国民党匪军。现在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，同样用劣势装备打败了拥有近代化装备的美国侵略军。          （新华社）
