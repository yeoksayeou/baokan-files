Now, in many places across the country, the organizations of the Chinese Communist Party have, in accordance with the provisions of the CCP Central Committee's January 1st decision on establishing a propaganda network, established a reporter system.

In places where the reporter system has already been established, reporters have, for the most part, actively engaged in the work of reporting to the people under the unified leadership of the Party Committee. The work of reporters has played a significant role in publicizing the policies of the Party and the government, raising the political consciousness of the people, promoting various central tasks, and strengthening the ties between the Party and the people. Especially around the "May Day" holiday, the work of reporters in many places powerfully promoted the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The people in various places have expressed warm welcome for the work of reporters. The experience in many places has also proven that the establishment of the Party's reporter system not only greatly strengthened and improved the Party's propaganda work towards the people, but also promoted many Party member cadres in leadership positions to pay more attention to politics and invigorated the Party's internal political life.

Facts have proven that the Central Committee's provisions on establishing a reporter system are completely correct and of great significance. In the future, Party committees at all levels must attach great importance to the work of reporters and pay attention to leading it. It must be understood that the work of reporters is an important part of the Party's propaganda work towards the people. Without doing this work well, we will not be able to complete the entire task of propaganda and education towards the people. At present, the organization of the propaganda network led by our Party for the people is composed of three parts: Party reporters, Party propagandists, and members of various mass propaganda organizations. None of these three can be missing. In order for the people to fully understand the Party's propositions and various policies, it is not enough to rely solely on the work of propagandists and mass propaganda organizations. The advantage of the propaganda work of propagandists and various mass propaganda organizations is that it is simple and easy to understand, but the disadvantage is that it lacks a systematic approach. In order to make up for this deficiency, it is necessary for responsible persons of the Party at all levels to directly make systematic reports to the people on current events, policies, work tasks, and work experiences. Our Party's leading organs have always had a fine tradition of making political reports to the people, but in the past this work was done in a more piecemeal and infrequent manner. The purpose of establishing the reporter system is to further strengthen this work so that it can be carried out regularly.

Since the establishment of the Party's reporter system, on the one hand, it has already achieved significant results, but on the other hand, in many places, the work of reporters still has serious shortcomings. These are: although reporters have been established, strict reporting systems have not been stipulated to make the work of reporters regular; some reporters in some places have not yet made reports to the people; and some places have not yet established a reporter system. These phenomena must be corrected.

The task for the future is to establish strict reporting systems in places where reporters have already been established to make the work of reporters regular; and in places where reporters have not yet been established, they should be established quickly. Generally speaking, the reporters of Party organizations above the county level should and can be established as soon as possible.

How can the work of reporters be done better and be regularized? According to the existing experience in various places, the following measures can be taken:

(1) Party committees at all levels should establish certain leadership systems for reporters. First, the Party Committee should hold reporter meetings regularly to review and discuss the work of reporting. Second, the Party Committee should periodically specify the specific tasks of reporters in coordination with the local central work, and uniformly formulate reporting plans. Such plans are best made every one to two months and closely integrated with the current central work. The Party Committee should pay attention to using the strength of reporters in various tasks, using the method of reporting to the people to promote the progress of the work, and regard the reporting work as an important driving force for promoting the work (the same should be done for propagandists). Third, help reporters formulate report outlines or outlines, and specify necessary reference materials. The report outlines formulated by the reporters themselves should be subject to appropriate review. Fourth, the implementation results of the reporting plan should be carefully checked, the reporting experience should be summarized, and good experiences and good reports should be published in newspapers to attract widespread attention. In short, only under the unified and planned leadership of the Party Committee can the work of reporters be continuously improved. This is the key to whether the work of reporters can be done well.

(2) Reporters should have specific divisions of labor and, as far as possible, fix the reporting areas and reporting objects of reporters. In cities, the reporting areas and reporting objects of reporters can be divided according to different classes, different industries, or different residential areas, so that each reporter can conduct reporting work in a certain area for a certain object for a relatively long period of time. The task of reporters in provinces, cities, regions, counties, and districts is mainly to go to the countryside to make reports, but the reporting areas of reporters can also be relatively fixed. The advantage of fixing the reporting areas and reporting objects of reporters is that it can enable reporters to establish regular contact with the masses in their reporting areas, so as to deeply understand the ideological conditions and demands of the masses, so that the content of the report can be more suitable for the needs of the masses. Moreover, this will naturally form a responsibility system for reporting work and facilitate the inspection of the work of reporters. Because Dalian and Wuhan have implemented such a system, the work of reporters has been done better.

Reporters from provinces, cities, regions, counties, and districts can organize and dispatch batches of people to the countryside to report to farmers' gatherings or representative meetings in conjunction with the central work. The reporters of the directly affiliated organs of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee have adopted such a method. When they go to the countryside, they form a group of three people, each group goes to a rural area, each time leaving on Saturday and returning on Monday, staying in the countryside for two nights. On the first day, the reporters who go to the countryside conduct individual visits during the day to understand the situation, and make political reports in three places in the evening, each time no more than two hours; on the second day, they specialize in making reports to women during the day, and organize various mass forums in the evening; on the third day, they put forward work opinions to the branch, the district committee, and the county committee before returning to their own organs. The result of this approach is very good. If the reporters of provinces, cities, regions, counties, and districts are going to more distant places, they can combine the reporting work with the inspection and deployment of work to carry out, so that the reporting work will not hinder the progress of other work, and the reporting work will be closely integrated with the central work, and directly promote various central work.

(3) In addition to assigning reporters according to regions and objects, in places with radio stations, reporters can also be organized to make reports on radio stations in a planned way. For example, reporters in Fujian Province have already done this. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee stipulates that reporters, in addition to reporting to the masses in the city where they are located in conjunction with various meetings, also take turns to make political reports to the people of the province on Fuzhou Radio Station every week. This system has been implemented since mid-April. This method can be imitated in places with radio stations.

(4) Enable reporters to assume the leadership responsibility of leading propagandists, and directly link the reporting work of reporters with the work of propagandists. The Party Committee should designate reporters to go to propagandist training stations to teach propagandists propaganda materials and be responsible for answering questions from propagandists. The Central Committee's decision has already stipulated that "reporters are a kind of senior propagandist and should be the leader of propagandists." Reporters in various places should attach importance to leading the work of propagandists. Only with the regular assistance of reporters can propagandists better carry out this work.

How to combine the work of reporters with the work of propagandists? The experience of some places is: when reporters go to the countryside to report to the people, they can first understand the ideological situation of the masses through local propagandists, and solicit the opinions of propagandists on the content of the report. After the reporter reports, the propagandist can help organize various mass forums to discuss the content of the report. The experience of many places has proven that following a large report with a forum can enable the masses to better understand and accept the content of the report. When reporters go to the countryside to report, they can also understand the work of propagandists and give necessary instructions and assistance.

(5) In order to facilitate regular inspection of the work of reporters, various places can implement a reporter inspection card system. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, the Southern Jiangsu District Party Committee, and the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee have implemented such a system. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee calls it "Reporter Card," and the Southern Jiangsu District Party Committee calls it "Reporter Work Status Investigation Form," but the nature is the same. The reporter card system of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee is implemented better. This card is uniformly formulated by the Provincial Party Committee and issued to reporters. The reporters bring it to the Party Committee where the report is located. After the reporter reports, the local Party Committee fills in the opinions of the masses (including opinions on the report and opinions on the work of the Party and the government) on it, and then forwards it to the Provincial Party Committee as the basis for the Provincial Party Committee to examine the work of the reporter. After receiving these cards, the Provincial Party Committee forwards the opinions of the masses on the work of the Party and the government to the relevant agencies for handling, and at the same time displays the cards on the organ wall newspaper. When exhibiting, reporters pay very close attention to reading these cards, and can improve their reporting work based on the opinions of the masses. Experience has proven that this card system is an important way to ensure that reporting work is regularly improved.

If the above measures can be earnestly implemented, it will naturally greatly improve the work of our Party's reporters and gradually become regularized.

Party committees at all levels must regard making political reports to the people as their indispensable and regular responsibility. The Party's reporters are reliable tools for fulfilling this responsibility. Only by attaching importance to one's own responsibility and regularly using the tools to fulfill this responsibility can one do a good job and establish a good organization for carrying out this work. That is to say, one must build a good organization in work and struggle.

### 把报告员的工作经常化

　　把报告员的工作经常化
    现在全国许多地方的中国共产党的组织都已遵照中共中央今年一月一日关于建立宣传网的决定中的规定，建立了报告员制度。
    在已经建立起报告员制度的地方，报告员大都已在党委的统一领导下积极展开了对人民群众作报告的工作。报告员的工作，对于宣传党和政府的政策，提高人民群众的政治觉悟，推动各项中心工作，密切党和人民群众的联系，都起了极大作用。特别是在“五一”节前后，许多地方的报告员的工作，有力地推动了抗美援朝运动及镇压反革命运动。各地人民群众都对报告员的工作表示热烈的欢迎。不少地方的经验并且证明，党的报告员制度的建立，不但大大加强和提高了党对人民群众的宣传工作，而且也推动了许多担负领导工作的党员干部更加注意政治，活跃了党内的政治生活。
    事实已经证明中央关于建立报告员制度的规定是完全正确的，有重大意义的。今后，各级党委都必须十分重视报告员的工作，注意对它的领导。必须了解，报告员工作，是党对人民群众的宣传工作的一个重要部分，不做好这一工作，我们就无法很好地完成对人民群众进行宣传教育的全部任务。目前我们党所领导的对人民群众的宣传网的组织，是由三部分人组成的，即党的报告员，党的宣传员，和各种群众性宣传组织的成员，三者缺一不可。为了使人民群众充分地了解党的主张和各种政策，仅靠宣传员和群众性的宣传组织的工作是不够的。宣传员和各种群众宣传组织的宣传工作，好处是通俗简单，缺点是没有系统。为了弥补这一不足，就必须由各级党的负责人直接向人民群众作关于时事、政策、工作任务、工作经验的有系统的报告。我们党的领导机关一向就有对人民群众作政治报告的优良传统，但过去这一工作做得比较零碎，比较不经常，建立报告员制度的目的，就是为了更加强这一工作，使它能够经常地进行。
    党的报告员制度自建立以来，一方面已经有了重大的成绩，但另一方面，在不少地方，报告员的工作还有严重的缺点，这就是：报告员虽已设立起来，但还没有规定严格的报告制度，使报告员的工作经常化；有的地方的某些报告员，至今还没有向人民群众作过报告；也有的地方至今还没有建立报告员制度。这些现象都必须加以纠正。
    今后的任务，就是要在已经建立起报告员的地方建立严格的报告制度，使报告员的工作经常化；而在尚未建立报告员的地方，都应迅速建立起来。一般说，各地县以上党的组织的报告员是应该而且可以尽快建立起来的。
    怎样使报告员的工作做得更好，并能够经常化呢？根据各地已有的经验，可以采取下列几项办法：
    （一）各级党委都建立对报告员的一定的领导制度。第一、党委应定期召开报告员会议，检查和讨论作报告的工作。第二、党委应按期配合当地各项中心工作规定报告员的具体任务，统一制定报告计划。这样的计划最好每一月至两月订一次，并且使它和当前中心工作密切结合起来。党委在各项工作中都应当注意使用报告员的力量，用向人民群众作报告的方法去推动工作的进行，把报告工作看作是推动工作的重要动力（对宣传员亦应如此）。第三、帮助报告员制订报告要点或提纲，指定必要的参考资料，报告员自己制订的报告提纲应经适当的审查。第四、应认真检查报告计划的执行结果，总结报告经验，将好的经验和好的报告在报纸上发表，以引起普遍的注意。总之，只有在党委的统一的有计划的领导下，报告员的工作才能得到不断的改进，这是报告员工作能否作好的重要关键。
    （二）报告员应当有具体的分工，尽可能固定报告员的报告地区和报告对象。在城市中，可以按照不同的阶层，不同的行业单位，或者按照不同的居民区，划分报告员的报告地区和报告对象，使每一个报告员都能比较长期地在一定的地区对一定的对象进行报告工作。省、市、地方、县及区的报告员，其任务主要是下乡作报告，但报告员的报告地区也可相对地固定。报告员的报告地区和报告对象固定起来的好处，是可以使报告员和自己报告地区的群众建立经常的联系，以便深入地去了解群众的思想状况和要求，这样就可使报告内容更切合群众的需要。而且这样自然就会形成报告工作的责任制，并便于检查报告员的工作。旅大、武汉等地由于实行了这样的制度，报告员的工作就做得比较好。
    省、市、地方、县和区的报告员可以结合中心工作有组织地分批下乡对农民集会或代表会议作报告。山西省委直属机关的报告员就采取了这样的办法，他们下乡时每三人编成一小组，每一小组到一农村，每次是星期六出发，星期一回来，在农村住两夜。下乡的报告员第一天白天进行个别访问，了解情况，晚上分三处作政治报告，每次不超过两小时；第二天白天专门向妇女作报告，晚上组织各种群众的座谈会；第三天向支部、区委、县委分别提出工作意见后即返回自己的机关。这种作法的结果很好。省、市、地方、县和区的报告员如果是到较远的地方，可以把报告工作和到下面检查、布置工作结合起来去进行，这样既可使报告工作不致妨碍其他工作的进行，又可使报告工作密切结合中心工作，并直接推动各项中心工作。
    （三）除了使报告员按照地区和对象分工外，在有广播电台的地方，还可以有计划地组织报告员到广播电台作报告。例如福建省的报告员就已经这样作了。福建省委规定报告员除结合各种会议向所在市群众作报告外，并每周轮流在福州广播电台向全省人民群众作一次政治报告，这一制度已从四月中旬开始实行。这种办法，在有广播电台的地方都可仿行。
    （四）使报告员担负起领导宣传员的领导责任，并使报告员的报告工作和宣传员的工作直接联系起来。党委应当指定报告员到宣传员传授站去对宣传员传授宣传材料，并负责解答宣传员的问题。中央决定中已经规定“报告员是一种高级的宣传员，并且应当是宣传员的领导者”。各地报告员都应当重视领导宣传员的工作。只有在报告员的经常帮助下，宣传员才能更好地进行这工作。
    怎样使报告员的工作和宣传员的工作结合起来呢？有些地方的经验是：报告员下乡对人民群众作报告时可先通过当地宣传员去了解群众的思想情况，并征求宣传员对报告内容的意见。在报告员报告后，宣传员可以帮助组织各种群众的座谈会，座谈报告内容。不少地方的经验证明，在大报告以后继之以座谈会，可以使群众更好地了解和接受报告内容。报告员在下乡作报告时，同时也可去了解宣传员的工作，并给以必要的指示和帮助。
    （五）为了便于经常检查报告员的工作，各地可以实行报告员检查卡片制度。山西省委、苏南区党委、西安市委等已实行了这样的制度。山西省委叫“报告员卡片”，苏南区党委叫“报告员工作状况调查表”，实际上性质是一样的。山西省委的报告员卡片制度执行得较好，这种卡片是由省委统一制定，发给报告员，由报告员带交报告所在地的党的委员会，在报告员报告后，由当地党的委员会把群众意见（包括对报告意见及对党和政府工作的意见）填写在上面，然后转交省委，作为省委考查报告员工作的根据。省委收到这些卡片后，把群众对党和政府工作的意见分别转有关机关处理，并同时将卡片在机关墙报上展览。展览时，报告员都非常注意地阅读这些卡片，并都能根据群众意见来改进自己的报告工作。这种卡片制度，经验证明是使报告工作经常得到改进的一个重要办法。
    以上各项办法如果都能认真地实行起来，自然就可使我们党的报告员工作得到很大的改进，并逐渐趋于经常化。
    各级党委必须把向人民群众作政治报告看作是自己的不可忽视的经常的责任。而党的报告员则是履行这项责任的可靠的工具。只有重视自己的这项责任，并经常运用履行这项责任的工具，才能既作好工作，又能建立好进行这项工作的组织。这就是说，要在工作中和斗争中才能建立好组织。
