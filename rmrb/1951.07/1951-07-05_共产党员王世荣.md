    Everyone knows that the Korean front is very arduous, with many unimaginable difficulties; everyone also knows that all these difficulties have been overcome by us one by one. However, how were these difficulties overcome?
    This is the result of the arduous struggle of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the people in the rear; but it is not enough to understand it only in this way. In addition to everyone's efforts, there is also a leading and promoting force. These are all the Communist Party members armed with Marxism-Leninism. With their noble spirit of selflessness and sacrifice, they endure hardship before others and enjoy comfort after others, stand at the forefront of heroic struggle, lead everyone to fight against difficulties, and finally break through thorns and obstacles, overcome all difficulties, and march towards victory.
    After reading the following story, everyone will understand this principle even more clearly.
    A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed at a ferry crossing on a certain river was ordered to protect the bridge, repair the bridge, and ensure smooth transportation. Whether this task could be completed was related to the lives of thousands of soldiers on the front line and the victory of the war.
    This icy river begins to melt in March. The tense period of ice melting arrived in early April. The roaring sound of ice breaking, the sound of ice floes colliding, shook both sides of the river like an earthquake.
    Under the impact of the ice, the bridge spanning the river was about to collapse. In order to protect the bridge piers from being destroyed by the ice, it was necessary to continuously bomb the ice floes near the bridge piers into pieces day and night. Ice blocks like small mountains came surging with the river flow. To defeat and crush these ice blocks was an extremely difficult and dangerous struggle.
    At this critical moment, Wang Shirong, the leader of the engineering squad and a Communist Party member, unhesitatingly proposed: "We must repair the bridge to prevent any difficulties in the supply to the front line."
    He said to the soldiers in his squad: "Comrades, the glorious task has come. Let's go!" This call inspired all the soldiers in the squad. The entire squad requested from the higher authorities to undertake this glorious task. Wang Shirong and eight soldiers all wrote letters of determination. Wang Shirong wrote in his letter of determination: "We are good sons and daughters of the Chinese people. It is right and glorious to sacrifice for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. If I sacrifice, I hope you will continue to work hard and complete the task."
    On the afternoon of April 5th, Wang Shirong and the eight soldiers held a meeting. Everyone came up with many ideas at the meeting and put forward the slogan "Crushing the ice floes means defeating the American devils." By 4 p.m., the river suddenly rose by four or five feet, and the ice flow impacted even more fiercely. After Wang Shirong was ready, he left a letter to the Party branch guaranteeing to resolutely complete the task, and gave his only 12,000 yuan RMB to the branch as his possibly last Party membership dues. Then, they set out on rafts and small boats, carrying explosives and other tools, to start the rescue and repair work.
    The nine people were divided into three groups, sitting in small wooden boats and advancing towards the ice flow. The small boats shuttled back and forth through the gaps in the ice. Three soldiers first jumped onto the ice floes, drilled holes, and placed the explosives. After they lit the fuse of the explosives, they quickly jumped onto the small boats and came out through the gaps in the ice again. At this time, the large ice floe was shattered in a loud roar. The soldiers on both sides of the river cheered enthusiastically for their first victory.
    The second time, Wang Shirong led six comrades again, sitting in small boats to fight the ice blocks. At this time, the river was rising even higher, and the ice floes were coming even more fiercely. Wang Shirong called on everyone again:
    "Comrades, victory is waiting for us, the time to make meritorious service has arrived."
    The small boats shuttled back and forth again in the gaps of the huge ice blocks. Three soldiers jumped onto the ice floes that were rolling towards the river bridge. Wang Shirong and three soldiers steered the small boats to fight another ice floe. Suddenly, with a bang, an ice floe hit the small boat, and the small boat was broken into two pieces. The soldiers on the boat fell into the river. The April river water was still bone-chillingly cold. When they climbed out of the river onto the ice floes, they were covered in ice injuries and their bodies were frozen stiff. No one uttered a word of complaint. Their eyes shot out an unyielding light, looking at the river bridge. The two comrades who remained on the shore hurriedly pushed the raft down to rescue them. The raft was overturned again as soon as it approached a large ice floe. The two comrades also quickly climbed onto the ice floes. The nine people stood on three ice floes, and the ice floes floated with the river flow. The nine people raised their fists and sang "The Song of Mao Zedong" loudly. Their loud singing overwhelmed the sound of the water flow and the impact of the ice blocks.
    The leaders and soldiers on the shore nervously pushed the large wooden boat, hoping to rescue these nine comrades. But the large wooden boat was blocked by a huge ice floe, and fifty or sixty people could not push it even with all their strength. At this time, the ice floe on which Wang Shirong and the other two soldiers were standing made a cracking sound, the ice floe cracked, and the three people fell into the river together. Xue Chengren, who was on another ice floe, also fell into the river. Amidst the anxious shouts of everyone, Wang Shirong suddenly emerged, climbed onto a small ice block, and shouted loudly:
    "Comrades, overcoming difficulties means victory."
    "We will never let the ice floes destroy our bridge."
    Then, he jumped into the river again, rescued the two comrades who were nearby, and jumped down again to rescue another companion. For a full half an hour, he rescued all eight people. They stood separately on several small ice blocks.
    Just as they were about to get out of danger, the river upstream rose again. The river flowed fiercely, and the ice blocks rolled down like landslides and tsunamis. An ice block ten feet high knocked down the small ice block on which Wang Shirong was standing, and Wang Shirong and another soldier, Wang Siyao, fell into the river again. Wang Siyao disappeared after falling into the river. Wang Shirong's head was in the gaps of the ice blocks, sinking and floating with the river flow. At this time, the comrades on the shore hurriedly rescued him with bamboo rafts, but the bamboo rafts were blocked by the ice blocks. Comrade Wang Shirong struggled to emerge from the cracks in the ice floes, and shouted with his last strength:
    "You hurry up and complete the task, don't save me."
    Before he could finish speaking, a large piece of ice floe rushed down, and the heroic and immortal figure sank in front of the ice floe.
    The soldiers who jumped into the water to rescue their distressed comrades painfully called out the names of Wang Shirong and Wang Siyao. They quickly wiped away their tears, remained silent for a moment, and, facing the river, shouted painfully:
    "Avenge Squad Leader Wang! Avenge Wang Siyao!"
    "Crushing the ice blocks means crushing the American aggression!"
    "Never let the ice blocks destroy the bridge, and ensure the supply to the front line!"
    Although it was dark, more soldiers climbed onto the rafts and jumped onto the ice floes to continue fighting the ice blocks. The sound of explosions, the sound of ice blocks breaking, and the high-pitched shouts echoed on the river. After two days and two nights of effort, not only was the old bridge protected, but a new bridge was also added. Trucks and cars rolled forward on these two bridges. This is the wheel of history moving forward, the wheel that Wang Shirong and other Communist Party members led the way in pushing forward, and no one can stop it.

　　共产党员王世荣
    钦本立
    谁都知道朝鲜前线是很艰苦的，有很多难以想象的困难；谁也知道，所有的困难都被我们一一克服了。但是，这些困难是怎样被战胜的呢？
    这是志愿军全体指战员与前后方人民坚韧奋斗的结果；但是，仅仅这样认识是不够的，除大家努力之外，还有一个带头推动的力量。这就是所有被马克思列宁主义思想武装起来的共产党员，他们以崇高地忘我牺牲的精神，吃苦在前，享受在后，站在英勇斗争的最前列，领导大家与困难搏斗，终能披荆斩棘，冲破所有的难关，向胜利迈进。
    看了下面一段故事，大家就会更加明了这个道理。
    驻防某江渡口的志愿军某部，奉命担任保护桥梁、抢修桥梁、保证运输畅通的任务。这个任务能否完成，关联着前线千千万万战士的生活和战争的胜利。
    这条冰河，三月间开始溶化。四月初，紧张的冰化时期到来了。轰隆轰隆的冰块破裂声，冰排撞击声，山崩地裂样震动着大江两岸。
    在冰块的冲击下，横跨江上的大桥，眼看抵挡不住了。为了保护桥墩不致被冰块冲毁，就必须昼夜不断地把桥墩附近的冰排炸成碎块。象小山一样的冰块，随着江流汹涌而来，要想打垮和粉碎这些冰块，是一场万分艰巨危险的斗争。
    在这万分危急关头，工兵班班长共产党员王世荣毫不犹豫地提出：“不让前线的接济发生任何困难，我们必须抢修桥梁。”
    他向自己班里的战士们说：“同志们，光荣的任务来了，我们来吧！”这个号召鼓舞了全班的战士。全班向上级提出要求，担任这个光荣的任务。王世荣和八位战士都写了决心书。王世荣的决心书上写着：“我们是中国人民的好儿女，为了抗美援朝保家卫国，牺牲也是应该的，光荣的。如果我牺牲了，盼望你们继续努力，一定完成任务。”
    四月五日的下午，王世荣和八个战士开了个会。大家在会上想出许多办法。提出了“粉碎冰排，就是战胜美国鬼子”的口号。到了下午四时，江水突然涨了四五尺，冰流冲击得更凶猛了。王世荣准备停当后，给党支部留下一封保证坚决完成任务的信，并把自己仅有的一万二千元人民币，交给支部，作为可能是最后一次的党费。于是，他们架着木筏、小船，带着炸药等工具，开始下水抢修了。
    九个人分成三组，坐着小木船向冰流前进。小船从冰块的空隙中穿来穿去。三个战士首先跳上了冰排，凿了洞，放好炸药。他们点燃炸药引线后，迅速跳上小船，又从冰块空隙中穿出来。这时，那块大冰排在轰隆一声巨响里炸碎了。江岸两旁的战士为他们第一次的胜利热烈欢呼。
    第二次，王世荣又带领了六个同志，坐着小船去和冰块作战。这时江水涨得更大了，冰排的来势也更凶猛了。王世荣又号召大家：
    “同志们，胜利在等着我们，立功的时候到了。”
    小船又在巨大冰块的空隙中穿来穿去。三个战士跳上了正向江桥滚来的冰排。王世荣和三个战士撑着小船，去和另一个冰排搏斗。忽然嘣咚一声，一块冰排撞着小船，小船被撞成两段，船上的战士落在江中。四月的江水还冷得刺骨，当他们从江水里爬上冰排的时候，已是遍体冰伤，通身冻僵了。谁也没叫一声苦。他们的眼中射出不屈的光芒，望着江桥。留在岸上的两个同志，急忙推下木筏去援救，木筏刚靠近一块大冰排，又被打翻了。这两个同志也迅速爬上了冰排。九个人分立在三块冰排上，冰排随着江流浮动。九个人举着拳头，高声唱着《毛泽东之歌》。他们的宏亮的歌声，压倒了水流和冰块的撞击声。
    岸上的首长和战士们，紧张地推着大木船，希望把这九位同志抢救出来。但大木船被一块巨大的冰排挡住了，五六十个人用尽气力也推不动。这时，王世荣和另外二个战士站立着的冰排发出一阵破裂声，冰排裂开了，三个人一齐掉到江中。另一个冰排上的薛成仁也掉到江水里去了。在大家的焦急叫喊声中，王世荣忽然露出头来，爬上一块小的冰块，高声喊着：
    “同志们，克服困难就是胜利。”
    “我们决不让冰排冲坏我们的桥梁。”
    于是，他又跳到江中，把临近的两位同志救了上来，又跳下去，救起另一个同伴。足足有半个小时，八个人全被他救了上来。他们分站在几块小的冰块上。
    在快要脱离险境的时候，上游的江水又涨起来。江流凶猛地流着，冰块排山倒海地滚了下来。一块有一丈高的冰块撞倒王世荣站立的小冰块，王世荣和另外一个战士王思尧又掉下江水里去了。王思尧掉下去后就不见了。王世荣的头在冰块空隙中，随着江流一沉一浮。这时，岸上的同志赶忙用竹排抢救，但竹排被冰块阻止了。王世荣同志挣扎着从冰排夹缝中冒出头来，用尽最后的力气高喊：
    “你们赶快完成任务，不要救我了。”
    话还没有说完，一片大冰块冲下来，英雄的不朽的影子在冰块前沉没了。
    跳下水里去抢救被难伙伴的战士们，沉痛地叫着王世荣和王思尧的名字。他们很快地揩干了泪水，沉默了片刻，面对着江水，沉痛地高呼着：
    “给王班长报仇！给王思尧报仇！”
    “粉碎冰块就是粉碎美国侵略！”
    “决不让冰块冲坏桥梁，保证前线供应！”
    天虽然黑了，但更多的战士爬上了木筏，跳上了冰排，继续和冰块斗争。爆炸声，冰块的破裂声，高亢的叫喊声，在江面上震荡着。经两天两夜的努力，不仅保护了旧有的那座大桥，并且还添了一座新桥。大车、汽车从这两座桥上滚滚前进。这是历史前进的车轮，是王世荣和其他共产党员带头推动前进的车轮，这是谁也阻止不住的。
