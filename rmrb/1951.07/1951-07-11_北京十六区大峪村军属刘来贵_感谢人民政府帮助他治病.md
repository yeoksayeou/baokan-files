Military Family Member Liu Laigui of Dayu Village, Sixteen Districts of Beijing,
Thanks the People's Government for Helping Him Get Medical Treatment

I am Liu Laigui from Dayu Village, Sixteen Districts of Beijing. My family consists of three people. My son, Liu Baokun, is currently serving in the military. My wife and I are approaching sixty years old. In January of this year, I contracted a severe stomach ailment, rendering me unable to eat and causing me to vomit blood continuously. Upon learning of my condition, the village chief of my village, Jing Yonglong, and civil affairs committee member, Cao Yu'er, promptly arranged for a doctor to examine me and reported the matter to higher authorities. Following the issuance of an introductory letter from the District People's Government, the deputy village chief, Gao Changyu, and three others carried me onto a train and transported me to the Beijing Municipal First Hospital for treatment. After a month of hospitalization, my condition improved. Village cadre Cao Jinjian then brought me back and treated me at our village clinic. Now, I have fully recovered.

The government covered all my medical expenses during this illness. District People's Government Civil Affairs Section Chief Tian Pei, Town Chief Zhang Chengmo, and village cadres alike demonstrated great concern for me. While I was in the hospital, they frequently inquired about my condition at my home. I am grateful to the government for their care. Without the People's Government, I would not be alive today. I assure the People's Government that I will actively participate in labor in the future, cultivate the land well, and alleviate the burden on the people. I will also write to my son, urging him to work diligently in the military and perform meritorious service for the people.

　　北京十六区大峪村军属刘来贵
    感谢人民政府帮助他治病
    我是北京市十六区大峪村人，全家三口人，我儿子刘宝坤现在部队中工作，我老两口子快到六十岁了。今年一月，我得了严重的肠胃病，不能吃东西，还不断吐血。我村村长井永隆、民政委员曹玉尔知道后，一面请大夫给我看病，一面往上汇报。经区人民政府开介绍信后，副村长高长玉等四人，就抬我上火车，把我送到北京市立第一医院医治。住院月余，我病势减轻了。村干部曹金建就把我接回，在我村治疗所医治。现在我已经全好了。
    我这次生病，医药费都是政府给的。区人民政府民政科长田培、镇长张成谟及村干部等对我都非常关心，我在医院时，他们经常到我家打听我的病情。我感谢政府对我的照顾，没有人民政府我就活不到今天。我向人民政府保证，今后我一定要积极参加劳动，将地种好，减轻人民的负担；并写信告诉我的儿子，在部队中好好工作，为人民立功。
