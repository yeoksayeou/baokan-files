　　Xianyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau
    Reply Regarding the Escape of a Counter-Revolutionary Element

    Editor:
    The criticism of our bureau by Comrade Lin Bin of the Zhengyang County People's Government Public Security Bureau in Henan Province, published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 24th, is correct. We are now informing you of the facts and how the matter was handled.

    At 6:00 PM on April 7th, two people from Zhengyang County, Henan Province, reported to the First Police Station of our bureau that: Li Haosan, a counter-revolutionary element from Zhengyang County, was a Kuomintang army company commander with many evil deeds, and the local masses were extremely resentful of him. He was now hiding in Xianyang County. The two people also requested the police station to assist in the arrest. At the time, the police station did not report to the county bureau, but immediately investigated, arrested, and detained the criminal Li; and instructed the two people who came from Zhengyang to send a telegram to the Zhengyang County Public Security Bureau, asking them to come and escort him back. On the evening of April 8th, Lei Zhang'e, the guard squad leader of the police station, was irresponsible when guarding the prisoner and left his post without authorization, causing Li to escape at around 4:00 AM on April 9th. After the police station discovered that Li had escaped, they reported the situation to our bureau. Our bureau immediately conducted an investigation, but ultimately failed to find the criminal Li. Afterwards, Comrade Yuan Zhiyong, the director of the police station, did not have a sufficient understanding of this serious problem, and did not humbly admit his mistake to the people who came from Zhengyang County, explaining the reasons for Li's escape; instead, he used the excuse of lacking materials and procedures to ask the masses from Zhengyang County to return, in order to cover up his own mistakes.

    The main reason for the incident was that the cadres of our bureau's First Police Station lacked vigilance, were negligent, and did not follow the rules. The police station arrested Li without first requesting instructions from the county bureau, and afterwards did not send him to the county bureau for custody, nor did they report to the county bureau; in addition, the public security officers were derelict in their duties, causing the prisoner to escape. Our bureau has ordered the police station to conduct a thorough self-criticism, and has given Lei Zhang'e, the guard squad leader who left his post without authorization and was irresponsible, the punishment of dismissal from his post and detention.

    Due to the county bureau's insufficient education of cadres in leadership, lax rules, and lack of specific inspection of lower-level work, we also bear certain responsibility for this incident, and we have made a self-criticism to the higher authorities. Finally, the original letter from Comrade Lin Bin stated that our bureau did not support the just actions of the masses and refused to take Li into custody on the grounds of "lack of materials," which does not correspond to the actual situation. We hereby clarify this.

### 咸阳县人民政府公安局  对反革命分子潜逃事件的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　咸阳县人民政府公安局
    对反革命分子潜逃事件的答复编辑同志：
    五月二十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏所刊河南正阳县人民政府公安局林彬同志对本局的批评是正确的。现将事实经过及处理情况告诉你们。
    四月七日下午六时，河南省正阳县有两个人向本局第一派出所报称：正阳县反革命分子李好三，曾任蒋匪军连长，恶迹很多，当地群众对他极为愤恨。现在他潜伏在咸阳县。该两人并要求派出所协同逮捕。当时派出所未报告县局，即将李犯查捕关押；并着正阳来此的两人向正阳县公安局发电报，要他们前来押解。四月八日晚上，该派出所警卫班长雷掌莪看押犯人时不负责任，擅离岗位，致使李犯在四月九日晨四时许潜逃。派出所发觉李犯潜逃后，始将情况报告本局。本局当即进行查缉，但终未将李犯查获。事后，该派出所所长员志勇同志对这一严重问题认识不足，未向正阳县来人虚心承认错误，述明李犯逃跑的原因；反以无材料无手续为理由，要正阳县群众回去，以掩盖自己的错误。
    事件发生的主要原因，是我局第一派出所干部的警惕性不高，麻痹大意，并且不按制度办事。该派出所逮捕李犯，事先既未向县局请示，事后又不送县局管押，亦不向县局作报告；加上公安战士工作失职，致使犯人潜逃。本局已责成该派出所进行深刻检讨，并给擅离岗位、不负责任的警卫班长雷掌莪以撤职管押的处分。
    由于县局领导上对干部教育不够，制度不严，对下级工作缺乏具体检查，因此对这一事件也负一定的负任，我们已向上级作了检讨。最后，林彬同志原信所说我局不支持群众的正义行动，以“无材料”为理由拒绝收押李犯，这与实际情况不符，特此说明。
        陕西省咸阳县人民政府公安局
