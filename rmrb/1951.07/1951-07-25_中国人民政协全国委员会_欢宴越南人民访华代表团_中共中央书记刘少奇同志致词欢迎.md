Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, as well as Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and other Standing Committee members in Beijing attended the reception. Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Hanfu, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and representatives from various departments in the capital, totaling over one hundred people, attended as guests.

At the banquet, Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, delivered a speech first. Guo Moruo expressed a warm welcome to the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, extended brotherly greetings to the heroic Vietnamese people, and paid tribute to Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese people! Guo Moruo said: "The people of China and Vietnam have always had a deep friendship. The arrival of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China will further strengthen the great unity between the two peoples. The people of China and Vietnam are making significant contributions in the great cause of opposing imperialism and defending world peace."

Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a welcome speech, saying:

"Comrades: On behalf of the Communist Party of China, I welcome the comrades of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, headed by Comrade Hoang Quoc Viet. The people of Vietnam and China have lived under the oppression of imperialism for many years, enduring painful lives. At the same time, they have waged struggles against imperialism for many years. Therefore, the Chinese people particularly understand and sympathize with the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and liberation. We believe that the Vietnamese people must unite under the leadership of the Vietnamese Workers' Party, guided by Marxism-Leninism, to achieve the final victory of the revolution. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, I celebrate the victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist struggle! Celebrate the victory of the Vietnamese Workers' Party's leadership! Celebrate the health of President Ho Chi Minh! Celebrate the health of all the comrades of the delegation!"

Hoang Quoc Viet, head of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China, replied:

"Dear Comrades: We were very excited to hear the speeches of Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo and Comrade Liu Shaoqi just now. Vietnam and China have close geographical and historical ties, and many basic political situations in the two countries are the same. China has the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, a broad united front, and powerful people's armed forces; Vietnam has the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Workers' Party, as well as a broad united front and people's armed forces. The Chinese people have already achieved victory, and the Vietnamese people will also defeat the French colonialists and American interventionists and achieve final victory. Today, being with you all, I don't feel like I am abroad, but like I am at home. We are in a close-knit revolutionary family. I wish Chairman Mao good health! I wish all comrades good health!"

The banquet ended in a warm and friendly atmosphere. A musical and dance performance was held after the banquet.
