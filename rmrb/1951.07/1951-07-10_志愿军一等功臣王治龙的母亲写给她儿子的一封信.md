The mother of Wang Zhilong, a first-class merit citation recipient of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, wrote a letter from Long'an Village, Liujie Township, Guanxian County, Western Sichuan, to her son on the Korean front. She described the happy life at home after the liberation and encouraged him to build on his merits and strive for greater glory for the motherland and the people. The original letter is as follows:
　　Zhilong, my son:

　　On the Dragon Boat Festival, Wang Zuozhou next door told me that you had earned a first-class merit on the Korean front for the people. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep for several nights. In the past few days, the township's Farmers' Association cadres and fellow farmers have been coming to our house to congratulate us, as if they were rushing to a fair. Today, County Chief Guo personally brought a silk banner to celebrate your achievement. Your Uncle Gan, who has always cared for you since you were little, and Grandma Yang, who is ninety-three years old, also came from more than ten miles away, leaning on their crutches. The market town of Liujie Township is plastered with big red congratulatory posters, and the house is filled with gifts from various organizations. This is the happiest event our family has ever had in three generations! Child, you must not forget the people's love for us!

　　Since the People's Liberation Army came to our township the winter before last and helped us reduce rent and overthrow the bullies, we are now about to distribute land. Our village has already established a Farmers' Association and a People's Armed Self-Defense Force. Your three older brothers are all members of the Farmers' Association, and your eldest sister-in-law is even the leader of the women's group. Our whole village has recovered 292 shi of rice as victory fruits from the landlords. Liu Shijie, Tian Maoqing, Zhou Guangtai, and other bastards who used to oppress us have all been shot. The villagers are all well-off. Your eldest and third brothers, who are carpenters, can earn more than ten jin of rice every day, and your second brother is busy making paper every day. Last year, our nine mu of land also had a bumper harvest, yielding an extra two hundred and fifty jin of grain, and the family also bought a big fat pig. Now, our family is getting better day by day. Four days before the news of your meritorious service arrived, your eldest sister-in-law gave birth to a baby boy. Neighbors all say that we have "double happiness at the door."

　　Our whole family held a special family meeting to support your fighting in Korea and made a patriotic pact. Your eldest brother will go into the mountains tomorrow to repair the highway from Guanxian County to Maoxian County. He said: "My fourth brother is a combat hero on the front line, and I will strive to be a road-building model in the rear!" This time, the Farmers' Association and the county government sent us two hundred jin of oil cake (the residue left after pressing rapeseed oil, which can be used as fertilizer), two hundred jin of rations, and a lot of farm tools. Your second and third brothers have promised to do careful and meticulous farming, apply more fertilizer, and make the nine mu of land yield an extra two hundred and seventy jin of grain, and donate thirty jin of rice to buy weapons. Your eldest sister-in-law, third sister-in-law and I, in addition to helping with farming, also have to cut pig grass, raise five pairs of ducks, spin more hemp thread, save more, ensure harmony between mother-in-law and daughters-in-law, and take good care of your two little nephews.

　　Child, our days are getting better and better, and we must not allow imperialist aggressors to destroy our lives. Please tell all the Volunteer Army comrades that the parents, brothers, and sisters all over the country are concerned about you and support you. You win more battles on the front line, and we will grow more grain in the rear, and forever defend our good life!

　　Your mother, Wang Gongshi. June 12th.

　　志愿军一等功臣王治龙的母亲写给她儿子的一封信
    中国人民志愿军某部一等功臣王治龙的母亲，从川西灌县柳街乡龙安村写信给她在朝鲜前线的儿子，叙述家里翻身后生活愉快的情况，并勉励他功上加功，为祖国与人民争取更大的光荣，原信如下：治龙儿：
    端阳节那天，隔壁王佐周给我说，你在朝鲜前线给人民立了一等功。我听了高兴得几夜没有睡着觉。几天来，乡上的农会干部和农民弟兄，好像赶场一样，每天不断地到我们家里来道喜。今天，郭县长也亲自带着锦旗来庆功。打小就心疼你的甘大爹和九十三岁的杨四奶奶也扶着拐杖从十多里外赶来了。柳街乡的场口贴着大红喜报，家里摆满了各机关送来的礼物，这是我们祖宗三代从来没有过的大喜事！娃娃，你切不能忘了人民对我们的爱护啊！
    自打前年冬天，解放军来到我们乡上，帮助我们减了租，斗垮了恶霸，现在跟着就要分田了。我们村里早已经成立起农协会和人民武装自卫队。你三个哥哥都是农会会员，你大嫂还是妇女小组长咧。我们全村从地主手里算回胜利果实二百九十二石大米，过去欺压过我们的刘仕杰、田茂清、周光泰等龟儿子都被枪毙了。村里的庄稼人都宽裕了，你做木匠的大哥、三哥每天可挣回十几斤米，你二哥造纸天天都不得闲。去年，我们种的九亩地，又是丰收，多打了二百五十斤谷子，家里还买了一口大肥猪。现在，我们家里一天比一天好过了。你立功喜报来到的前四天，你大嫂又添了一个男娃儿，左邻右舍都说我们是“双喜临门”。
    我们全家为了支援你们在朝鲜打仗，特地开了个家庭会议，订了爱国公约。你大哥明天就要进山去修灌县到茂县的公路。他说：“老四在前方当了战斗英雄，我在后方要争取当一个筑路模范！”这回农会和县政府给我们送来二百斤油枯（用菜籽榨油后剩下的渣滓，可做肥料），二百斤口粮和不少的农具。你二哥三哥都保证做到精耕细作，多施肥料，使九亩田多收二百七十斤谷子，捐三十斤米买武器。我和你大嫂三嫂，除了帮助种田，还要割猪草，要养五对鸭子，多打麻线，多节省，保证婆媳和气，把你的两个小侄儿带好。
    娃娃，我们的日子是一天比一天好过了，我们的生活是绝不能让帝国主义侵略者来破坏的，你转告全体志愿军同志们吧，全国的父母兄弟姊妹，都在关心你们，都在支援你们，你们在前方多打胜仗，我们在后方多打粮食，永远保卫我们的好生活！
            你的母亲王龚氏。六月十二日
