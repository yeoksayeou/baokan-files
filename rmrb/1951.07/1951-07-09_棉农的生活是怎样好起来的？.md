　　How Did Cotton Farmers' Lives Improve?
    Yang Shi
    On June 1, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on the work of purchasing and storing cotton, calling on cotton farmers to immediately sell their existing cotton to the state or store it with the state in kind, in order to supply the urgent needs of the textile industry, ensure clothing for the military and civilians, and ensure price stability. This call has been warmly and widely responded to by the broad masses of cotton farmers. However, there are still some cotton farmers who are not clear about the truth that protecting the country leads to prosperity; who are not clear about why their lives have generally improved and why they have cotton in storage at home; who are not clear about the relationship between themselves and the state; therefore, they are not active enough in selling and storing cotton to the state. Here, I would like to briefly describe the help and support given to cotton farmers by the people's state, in order to help the broad masses of cotton farmer brothers understand the principle that protecting the country is essential for prosperity. This description will be limited to the economic policies of the people's state. As for the political aspects, such as the people's state leading farmers to implement land reform, eliminating the feudal land system, and allowing the broad masses of farmers to turn over a new leaf, etc., I will not elaborate here.
    Taking the situation in North China as an example (the cotton-producing area of North China includes the three provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi, with Hebei Province being the main one, accounting for a quarter of the national output):
    First, the state firmly guaranteed the ratio between the price of cotton and grain. According to the regulations of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, the minimum price of cotton in Hebei and Pingyuan should be eight and a half jin of millet per jin of cotton, and in Shanxi it should be nine jin of millet. The actual result was generally higher than this standard. When cotton was first put on the market last August, because grain was cheap, the cotton-grain ratio in Hebei Province generally reached more than ten jin of millet, and at most thirteen jin. The price of cotton in Shanxi generally reached thirteen or fourteen jin. At this time, cotton farmers were very active in selling cotton for grain. In mid-September, the cotton-grain price ratio was adjusted. Calculated according to the new rice price or the average price of new and old rice, the cotton price in each province met the prescribed standards, and the situation of cotton farmers selling and the state purchasing tended to normalize.
    When American imperialism expanded its aggression in Korea and our country's movement to resist America and aid Korea developed rapidly, the broad masses of cotton farmers, based on historical experience, were afraid that cotton would not be sold or would not be sold at a good price if a war broke out, so they rushed to sell cotton. At this time, the state trading organs did have certain difficulties in purchasing funds and could not fully meet such concentrated and large-scale purchasing requirements. However, the state is responsible to cotton farmers. The state trade and cooperative institutions in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi and other provinces, on the one hand, continued to make spot purchases at reasonable listed prices, and on the other hand, conducted barter purchases with grain, coal, salt, cloth, department stores and other goods, and made credit purchases with the conditions of principal and interest protection to supplement the shortage of cash purchases. At the same time, market management was strengthened, and struggles were launched against the opportunistic merchants who took the opportunity to lower prices. In November, for a period of time, the market price of seed cotton in various parts of Hebei was 200 to 300 yuan lower than the listed price, and the price of lint cotton was 500 to 600 yuan lower than the listed price. In Yuci, Pingyao, Linfen, Fenyang and other places in Shanxi, the market price of cotton was 5% to 15% lower than the listed price, and it was not easy to sell. After the state's cash purchases, barter purchases, credit purchases and appropriate administrative management, the market price quickly returned to the level of the listed price.
    Thanks to the strong support of the state, cotton prices remained reasonable even in the most difficult months at the beginning of the campaign to resist America and aid Korea, so that cotton farmers were spared losses. Later, as the state's purchasing funds increased, the market buying and selling situation turned to normal, and cotton farmers were more guaranteed to sell cotton at favorable prices.
    Second, the state supplied the main materials necessary for cotton farmers. In addition to grain, cloth, salt, and department stores, North China has made great efforts in the supply of fertilizers and coal this year.
    Fertilizer is necessary for increasing cotton production. This year, the state prepared sufficient soybean cake and supplied it to cotton farmers at prices lower than in any year in history. For example, the cotton-producing area of Hebei is estimated to need 700 million jin of soybean cake, and the state trade organs and cooperatives have prepared a total of 420 million jin (the rest is fully managed by private merchants), accounting for 60% of the possible needs, more than twice the amount prepared in 1949. The lowest historical price of soybean cake was 0.56 jin of millet per jin, but this year it is only equivalent to 0.53 jin of millet. In order to help increase cotton production, the state did not hesitate to stockpile a large amount of funds and lent all the stored soybean cake to cotton farmers in exchange for cotton or other cash crops. This gave a strong guarantee for this year's increase in cotton production.
    In response to the shortage of fuel and the need for coal in cotton-producing areas, the state decided that in addition to meeting the needs of industry and large cities, the needs of cash crop areas and cotton-producing areas should be met first. The population of the cotton-producing area of Hebei Province is only one-third of the province, but the coal supplied by the state to the cotton-producing area accounts for more than 90% of the amount supplied to the whole province. During the peak season for coal sales in autumn and winter, the task of supplying coal was put on the most important agenda of state trade work. Thousands of cadres worked hard, and leading cadres constantly checked and instructed, and finally ensured that cotton farmers did not experience serious difficulties during the season when the demand for coal was greatest in autumn and winter, and could get sufficient supply in spring and summer.
    In addition, the state implemented guidance on cotton farmers' production technology, loans for seeds, crop insurance in some areas, signing pre-purchase contracts, and a burden policy in cotton areas that was no higher than that in general crop areas, which effectively promoted cotton production and increased cotton farmers' income.
    The state's various measures to protect the interests of cotton farmers, coupled with the active labor of the cotton farmers, have led to the development of cotton production year by year. In 1949, cotton production in North China recovered to two-thirds of the pre-war level. In 1950, it reached and slightly exceeded the pre-war level. In 1951, it was required to increase by another quarter compared with 1950. Judging from the results of sowing, if the year is normal, this plan may be realized and exceeded this year.
    As cotton production rises year by year, the lives of cotton farmers are also improving day by day. According to a survey of certain villages in the Liaocheng area of Pingyuan Province, in the past two years, due to the expansion of cotton fields, especially because the state has guaranteed the cotton-grain ratio, the total annual income of cotton farmers has generally increased by more than 40% compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. The lives of new middle peasants are almost all exceeding the living standards of old middle peasants before the Anti-Japanese War. The fact that cotton farmers in the Handan area of Hebei Province universally buy calico, bicycles, and flashlights after becoming rich is a well-known fact throughout the country. These industrial products are all manufactured by worker brothers. If farmers do not sell cotton, factories cannot produce cheap and high-quality cloth.
    In this cotton purchase and storage campaign, many cotton farmers recalled the tragic scenes of "bumper harvests turning into disasters" and "cheap grain hurting farmers" during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Japanese imperialist occupation, and have realized that in the old society, no matter how hard cotton farmers worked, they could not become rich, and their lives could only decline year by year. Only after the People's Government and the people's state were established could cotton farmers become rich and their lives become prosperous. I hope that all cotton farmer brothers can deeply understand this truth, and therefore love our people's state; in today's situation where the country urgently needs cotton to supply yarn mills, supply clothing for the military and civilians, and ensure price stability, enthusiastically give assistance to the country. This is not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to the cotton farmers themselves. Only when the country can smoothly overcome difficulties can the interests of cotton farmers be guaranteed for a long time.

### 棉农的生活是怎样好起来的？

　　棉农的生活是怎样好起来的？
    杨石
    六月一日，中央人民政府政务院发布关于购棉储棉工作的指示，号召棉农立即将存棉卖给国家或向国家作实物存储，借以供应纺织工业的急迫需要，保证军民衣着，保证物价稳定。这一号召已经得到广大棉农群众热烈而普遍的响应。但是，也还有一部分棉农，还不清楚保国才能发家的真理；还不清楚自己的生活为什么能够普遍上升，家里为什么能够有了存棉；还不清楚自己和国家的关系；因而，他们对于售储棉花给国家，还表现不够积极。这里，我愿意把人民的国家对棉农的帮助和扶植概略叙述一下，借以帮助广大棉农兄弟认识发家必须保国的道理。这种叙述，我准备仅限于人民国家的经济政策方面。至于政治方面，例如：人民国家领导农民实行土地改革，消灭了封建的土地制度，广大农民才能翻过身来，等等，这里就不多说了。
    以华北的情况而论（华北产棉区包括河北、平原、山西三省，其中主要的是河北省，产量占全国四分之一）：
    第一、国家坚决保证了棉花和粮食的比价。按照中央人民政府财政经济委员会规定，河北、平原每斤棉花的最低价格应为八斤半小米，山西应为九斤小米。实际执行的结果，一般的都超过了这个标准。去年八月棉花初上市时，因为粮食便宜，棉粮比价在河北省一般达到十斤小米以上，最高达到十三斤。山西棉价一般达到十三、四斤。此时棉农售棉换粮，极为活跃。九月中旬调整棉粮比价，按新米价或新米陈米平均价计算，各省棉价都符合规定标准，棉农出售和国家收购的情况趋于正常。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜扩大侵略，我国抗美援朝运动迅速开展的时候，广大棉农群众根据历史的经验，怕打起仗来棉花卖不出去，或是卖不上好价钱，纷纷抢售棉花。此时国家贸易机关的收购资金确有一定困难，不能充分满足如此集中的大量的收购要求。然而国家对棉农是负责的。河北、平原、山西等省国家贸易和合作社机构，一面继续按合理牌价进行现购，一面又以粮、煤、盐、布、百货等实物进行换购，并以保本保值行息的条件进行赊购，以补充现款收购之不足。同时加强市场管理，对部分投机商人乘机压价的行为展开斗争。十一月份有一个时期，河北各地籽棉市价曾低于牌价二、三百元，皮棉低于牌价五、六百元，山西榆次、平遥、临汾、汾阳等地棉花市价低于牌价百分之五至百分之十五不等，而且不易出售。经过国家的现购、换购、赊购和适当的行政管理，市价很快又回复到牌价水平。
    由于国家的大力支持，在抗美援朝初期最困难的月份里，棉价始终保持合理，使棉农免于吃亏。其后国家收购资金增加，市场购销情况转向正常，棉农按有利的价格出售棉花，更加有了保障。
    第二、国家供应了棉农必需的主要物资。除粮食、布匹、食盐，百货外，今年华北在肥料和煤炭的供应方面花了极大的力量。
    肥料为棉花增产所必需。今年国家准备了充足的豆饼，并按低于历史上任何一年的价格供应棉农。如河北产棉区估计需要豆饼七亿斤，国家贸易机关与合作社共准备了四亿二千万斤（其余部分，私商有充分力量经营），占可能需要量的百分之六十，比一九四九年准备的数量多两倍以上。豆饼价格，历史上最低是每斤零点五六斤小米，今年只合零点五三斤小米。国家为帮助棉花增产，并且不惜积压大量资金，把所存豆饼全部贷给棉农，预换棉花或其他经济作物。这对今年棉花的增产给了有力的保证。
    针对产棉区燃料缺、需要煤炭的情况，国家决定，全国煤炭除满足工业与大城市需要外，首先就要满足经济作物区、产棉区的需要。河北省产棉区人口不过全省的三分之一，而国家供应产棉区的煤炭却占供应全省数量的百分之九十以上。在秋冬销煤旺盛季节，供应煤炭的任务被提到国家贸易工作最重要的议事日程上。成千干部紧张工作，领导干部不断检查和指示，终于保证了棉农在秋冬需煤最多的季节，不感受严重困难，在春夏两季更能得到充分供应。
    此外，国家实行了对棉农生产技术的指导，贷款贷种、部分地区实行收成保险，订立预购合同，以及棉区不高于一般作物区的负担政策等措施，曾经有力地推动了棉花增产和棉农收入增多。
    国家的种种保护棉农利益的措施，加上棉农群众的积极劳动，棉花的生产就一年比一年发展起来。一九四九年华北棉产量恢复到战前水平的三分之二，一九五○年达到并且略略超过战前的水平，一九五一年要求比一九五○年再增加四分之一。从播种的结果看，如果年景正常，今年这一计划可能实现并且超过。
    由于棉花生产一年比一年高涨，棉农群众的生活也一天比一天改善了。根据平原省聊城专区某些村的调查，两年来，由于棉田的扩大，特别是由于国家保证了棉粮比价，棉农全年的总收入，一般的已较抗日战争前增加百分之四十以上。新中农的生活，差不多都超过了抗日战争前老中农的生活水平。河北省邯郸专区棉农富裕之后，普遍购买花布、自行车、手电筒，已是全国熟知的事实。这些工业品，都是工人弟兄制造出来的。如果农民不出售棉花，工厂就不可能出产价廉物美的布匹。
    在此次购棉储棉运动中，许多棉农群众回忆到国民党反动派统治时期和日本帝国主义侵占时期的“丰收成灾”、“谷贱伤农”的惨景，已经觉悟到在旧社会里，棉农不管怎样辛勤劳动都不能发家，生活只能逐年下降，只是在有了人民政府，有了人民的国家以后，棉农才能发家，生活才能富裕。希望所有棉农兄弟们都能深深体会这一真理，因而热爱我们的人民国家；在国家急切需要棉花以供应纱厂、供应军民衣着、保证物价平稳的今天，热烈地给国家以帮助。这不仅对国家有利，对棉农自己也是有利的。只有国家能顺利地克服了困难，才能使棉农利益有长久的保证。
