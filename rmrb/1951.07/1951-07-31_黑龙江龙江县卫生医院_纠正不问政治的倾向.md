 　Heilongjiang Longjiang County Health Hospital
　　Correcting the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics

To the Editor:

    I am the director of the political department of the Longjiang County Health Hospital in Heilongjiang Province. After reading the "Circular on Opposing the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics" issued by the Xinxiang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Pingyuan Province and the article "The CCP Committee of Huojia County, Pingyuan Province, Examines the Tendency of Not Asking About Politics" published in the People's Daily, I examined my own work and found that I have the corrupt idea of not attaching importance to politics, and the entire hospital also has a serious tendency of not asking about politics.

    The leading cadres of our hospital have always emphasized professional work and neglected politics. For example, I once thought: "No matter whether the political quality of the cadres is high or not, as long as they are working, aren't they still resisting America and aiding Korea?" Therefore, we neglected political study under the pretext of "heavy workload and many tasks." We rarely studied politics seriously, and sometimes even slept during study time; therefore, our leadership over the political study of all comrades in the hospital was also very poor. Although the main cadres of our hospital have given 69 reports of various sizes to all staff and convalescents in the past eight months; this was only reporting for the sake of reporting, and the purpose and effect of giving reports were neglected. Some comrades did not go to listen when reports were given, and most comrades did not take notes when listening; we never organized comrades to study after the reports. The political understanding of all comrades in the hospital is generally very poor. In early June, our hospital held a political test, with 38 participants, but only 6 passed. Some comrades also have serious purely technical viewpoints. They believe that: "Having technology is enough, whether or not you study politics is still 300 yuan in wages." "With technology, you can go anywhere." The leading cadres have not paid attention to these situations.

    After recent study, we realized our past mistakes of not asking about politics. In addition to ensuring that we seriously study politics ourselves, we also decided to strengthen the leadership of all comrades in the hospital, closely integrate political study with the current situation and the ideological situation of the comrades, in order to reverse the tendency of not asking about politics in our hospital and make our work better.

### 黑龙江龙江县卫生医院　纠正不问政治的倾向

  　黑龙江龙江县卫生医院
　　纠正不问政治的倾向编辑同志：
    我是黑龙江省龙江县卫生医院的政治处主任。读了人民日报所刊中共平原省新乡地方委员会关于《反对不问政治的倾向》的通报和《中共平原省获嘉县委检查不问政治的倾向》等文后，我检查了自己的工作，发现我有着不重视政治的腐朽思想，整个医院也有着严重的不问政治的倾向。
    我们医院的领导干部们，一直是强调业务而忽视政治的。如我曾经这样想：“不管干部政治质量高不高，只要他们做工作，还不是在抗美援朝吗？”因此就借口“工作繁重，任务多”而忽视政治学习。我们就很少认真学习政治，有时竟在学习时间睡大觉；因而我们对全院同志政治学习的领导也是很差的。我院主要干部在过去八个月中虽然曾向全院工作人员、休养员作过大小报告六十九次；但这只是为报告而报告，对作报告的目的和效果是忽视的。报告时有些同志不去听，绝大部分同志听时不做笔记；我们在报告后也从没组织同志们学习过。全院同志们政治认识普遍很差。六月初我院曾举行了一次政治测验，参加者三十八人，但及格者仅六人。有一部分同志还有着严重的单纯技术观点。他们认为：“有技术就行，学不学政治都是三百分工薪。”“有技术走遍天下”。领导干部对这些情况一直未加重视。
    经过最近的学习，我们才认识了过去不问政治的错误。我们除了保证自己认真学习政治外，并决定加强领导全院同志，密切结合目前形势和同志们的思想情况进行政治学习，以扭转我院不问政治的倾向，使我们的工作做得更好。
      黑龙江省龙江县卫生医院政治处主任  马岫
