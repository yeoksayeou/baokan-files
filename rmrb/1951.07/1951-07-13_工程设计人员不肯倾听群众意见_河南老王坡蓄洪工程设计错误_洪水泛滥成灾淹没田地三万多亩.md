　　Engineering Design Personnel Refuse to Listen to Mass Opinions
　  Henan Laowangpo Flood Storage Project Design Errors
　  Flooding Disaster Submerges Over 30,000 Mu of Farmland
    The Laowangpo depression flood storage project on the upper reaches of the Hong River between Xiping and Yancheng counties in Henan Province (one of the larger Huai River control projects that began construction last winter, its main function being to intercept floodwaters from the Hong River during the flood season, reducing the volume of water in the Huai River and ensuring the wheat harvest within the flood storage area) suffered from design errors because the engineering design personnel did not conduct sufficient investigation and research, and failed to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. The project leaders failed to provide adequate ideological guidance to the design personnel beforehand and blindly approved the project design. As a result, the design errors became factual errors, leading to an unfortunate flood disaster.
  Design Personnel Committed Subjectivist Errors
  Did Not Accept Opinions of Local Cadres and Masses
    The main errors in the project design were two: The first was that, during the design and construction of the flood diversion channel, the riverbank (north bank of the Hong River) at the inlet of the flood diversion channel was breached. Local government officials and the masses believed this measure was inappropriate and suggested building a secondary dike (dam) to ensure safety. However, the engineering technical personnel did not consider accepting this correct opinion. They subjectively estimated that there would be no major floods before the wheat harvest, and therefore believed that it was not necessary to build flood protection facilities before the flood season. The second was that the designed length of the flood diversion channel was insufficient. The highest flood storage level at Laowangpo was 87.5 meters, and the normal water level was 86.9 meters. Based on this situation, after the lower end of the flood diversion channel entered Laowangpo, it should have been extended to below the water level elevation of 87.5 meters. However, the design of the flood diversion channel only reached a height of 87.5 meters. Local cadres and the masses also raised objections to this design, suggesting further extension, but this was not adopted either.
  Mid-May Heavy Rain Causes Flood Overflow
  Sixty-Four Villages in Xiping and Yancheng Counties Affected
    From May 13th to 14th this year, there was heavy rain in Xiping and Yancheng. The total rainfall in Xiping was 111.7 mm, the highest water level of the Hong River at the Guili inlet was 91.81 meters, the maximum flow rate was 158.6 cubic meters per second, and the bottom of the inlet was at an elevation of 90.00 meters. When the water level of the Hong River began to rise on the morning of the 14th, because the riverbank at the inlet had been breached, the Xiping County People's Government immediately mobilized more than 2,000 people to build a dam 120 meters from the inlet to prevent floodwaters from entering Laowangpo. At 1:00 PM, the water level of the Hong River outside the inlet exceeded a height of 90 meters. Fearing that one dam would not be enough, the cadres of the Xiping County People's Government built another dam three kilometers inside the inlet. However, due to hasty construction with loose soil and rapid flow, the first dam collapsed at 10:00 PM on the 14th; around 1:00 AM on the morning of the 15th, the second dam also collapsed. At this time, the floodwaters began to enter Laowangpo. By 5:20 AM, a total of one million cubic meters of water had entered. In addition, because the length of the flood diversion channel was insufficient, the floodwaters overflowed from the flood diversion channel in all directions, causing a flood disaster. According to investigation and statistics, this flood submerged more than 20,800 mu of wheat fields. Including the submerged autumn crops, the total area was over 30,000 mu. Fifty-three villages in Xiping County and eleven villages in Yancheng County were affected. The local masses began to doubt the government's slogan of "intercepting floodwaters to ensure the wheat harvest," and their enthusiasm for production was significantly dampened. If the engineering design personnel had conducted more thorough investigation and research beforehand and listened to the opinions of the masses, this disaster could have been completely avoided.
  Local People's Government Takes Emergency Measures
  Consoles and Relieves the Masses, Investigates Responsibility for the Incident
    After the flood disaster occurred, the local government immediately took various emergency measures to deal with the aftermath. After the breach occurred at 1:00 AM on the morning of May 15th, the Xiping County Magistrate immediately convened cadres to go to various villages to lead the masses to check the village protection dikes, mobilizing the masses to build dams to block the water and prevent the flood area from expanding. After the flood receded, they organized the masses to dig ditches to drain the water. On the 18th, they organized 150 cadres and students to go to the disaster area to offer condolences and investigate the extent of the damage. On the 18th, the Henan Provincial Huai River Control Headquarters, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Provincial Supervisory Committee organized an inspection and condolence team to go to the disaster area together with prefectural and county-level leading cadres to offer condolences. On the one hand, they listened to the opinions of the local government and the masses, explained to the masses and admitted the errors in the project design; on the other hand, they investigated the disaster situation and the Provincial People's Government allocated one million catties of grain for relief, and called for the organization of various sideline productions. After being consoled and relieved, the morale of the masses has greatly improved.
    In terms of engineering, various necessary inspections and treatments have also been carried out; and the masses have been advised to make full preparations to ensure safety during the flood season.
    After the incident, the Henan Provincial Huai River Control Headquarters, in addition to ordering the relevant personnel of the Engineering Department to conduct a deep self-criticism, investigate responsibility, and report to the Provincial Supervisory Committee for supervision and handling, also used this serious lesson to inform all design and construction personnel and administrative personnel to launch discussions, as a practical example for examining work and educating administrative cadres and technical personnel.

### 工程设计人员不肯倾听群众意见  河南老王坡蓄洪工程设计错误  洪水泛滥成灾淹没田地三万多亩

　　工程设计人员不肯倾听群众意见
　  河南老王坡蓄洪工程设计错误
　  洪水泛滥成灾淹没田地三万多亩
    河南省西平、郾城两县之间洪河上游的老王坡洼地蓄洪工程（是去年冬季即开始施工的较大的治淮工程之一，主要作用是在汛期拦蓄洪河洪水，减少淮河水量，并保证蓄洪区内的麦收），由于工程设计人员调查研究不够，又未能虚心倾听群众意见，工程设计发生错误；工程负责干部事先对设计人员未注意进行思想领导，并盲目地批准了工程设计。这样，就使设计的错误成为事实上的错误，造成不幸的水灾。
  设计人员犯了主观主义错误
  没有接受当地干部群众意见
    这次工程设计的主要错误有两个：第一个是，在引洪道设计及施工中，把引洪道进水口河堤（洪河北岸堤）扒断。当地政府负责干部和群众认为这种措施是不妥当的，曾经提出做子堰（挡水坝）以保证安全。但是负责工程技术的人员却没有考虑接受这一正确意见。他们主观地估计麦收前不会有大水，因而认为在汛期前没有必要做防水设备。其次是引洪道设计长度不够。老王坡最高蓄洪水位为八七·五公尺，一般水位为八六·九公尺。根据这种情况，引洪道的下口入老王坡以后，应延长至水位高程达八七·五公尺以下。但引洪道的设计，恰好只到八七·五公尺高度。对这个设计，当地干部群众也曾提出不同意见，建议再向前延伸；但也未被采纳。
  五月中旬一场大雨洪水漫溢
  西平郾城两县六十四村受灾
    今年五月十三日至十四日，西平、郾城一带大雨。西平总雨量为一一一·七公厘，桂李进水口洪河水位最高为九一·八一公尺，最大流量为一五八·六秒公方，进水口底为九○·○○公尺高程。当十四日晨洪河水位开始上涨，因为进水口河堤已被扒断，西平县人民政府立即发动群众二千余人，在进水口一二○公尺处，打坝一处，以防堵洪水灌入老王坡。下午一时，进水口外洪河水位超过九○公尺高度，西平县人民政府干部恐怕一道堵水坝不成，又在口内三公里处筑了一道拦水坝。但因仓促行硪土虚流急，第一坝在十四日午后十时溃决；十五日晨一时许，另一道坝又溃决。这时，洪水开始向老王坡进水。至五时二十分，共进水一百万立方公尺。加以引洪道长度不够，洪水出引洪道四处漫溢，酿成水灾。据调查统计，此次洪水共淹没麦地二万零八百多亩。加上被淹秋地，则在三万亩以上。西平县五十三个村受灾，郾城县十一个村受灾。当地群众对政府“拦蓄洪水保证麦收”的口号发生了怀疑，生产情绪受到相当大的打击。假使工程设计人员事先能进行较为充分的调查研究，倾听群众意见，这次灾害是完全可以避免的。
  当地人民政府采取紧急措施
  慰问救济群众追查事件责任
    水灾发生后，当地政府立即采取了各种紧急措施，处理善后问题。当五月十五日晨一时决口后，西平县长即召集干部分别到各村领导群众查看围村堤，发动群众打堰堵水，不使洪波范围扩大。洪水过后，即组织群众挖沟排水。十八日，又组织干部及学生百五十余人到灾区进行慰问，调查损失情况。十八日，河南省治淮总指挥部、民政厅、省监察委员会组织检查慰问组，协同专区及县级领导干部到灾区进行慰问。一方面听取当地政府及群众意见，向群众宣传解释并承认在工程设计上的错误；一面调查灾情，由省人民政府拨粮一百万斤进行救济，并号召组织各种副业生产。群众经过慰问救济后，情绪已大为好转。
    在工程方面，也进行了各种必要的检查与处理；并劝导群众作充分准备，以保证汛期安全。
    事件发生后，河南省治淮总指挥部除责成工程部有关人员进行深刻检讨，追查责任，报请省监察委员会监察处理外，并以此严重教训，通报全体设计施工人员及行政人员展开讨论，作为检查工作教育行政干部和技术人员的实际例子。
