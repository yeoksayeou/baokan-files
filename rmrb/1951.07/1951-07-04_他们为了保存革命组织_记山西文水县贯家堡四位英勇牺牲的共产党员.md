They Sacrificed Themselves to Preserve the Revolutionary Organization
　　——A Record of Four Heroic Communist Party Members Who Sacrificed Themselves in Guanjia Fort, Wenshui County, Shanxi
    Liang Xing
    Guanjia Fort is only eight li away from Yunzhou West Village, the hometown of Liu Hulan. In 1948, the year after Liu Hulan's martyrdom, four Communist Party members in Guanjia Fort heroically sacrificed their lives in order to preserve the revolutionary organization. Among them, three were from the same family—father, mother, and son.
    The father, named Li Baorong, was an old poor peasant in his fifties. He joined the Party when the Communist Party first came to Guanjia Fort for secret activities. Later, he served as the village's Party branch secretary. The mother was also a Communist Party member. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she constantly carried a basket to scout the situation of the Japanese strongholds in Xinxian Village. The son, named Li Mingzi, was a young Communist Party member who participated in the village's guerrilla group and persisted in armed struggle.
    From the Japanese surrender to the summer of 1948, the people of the Wenshui Plain were engaged in fierce struggles against the enemy. Li Mingzi's guerrilla group had only ten or so people, only a few guns, and only a small number of bullets, but they persisted in their heroic struggle. Once, Yan Xishan's bandit army came to the village to loot grain. The guerrilla group and the self-defense force retreated outside the village, borrowed a grenade launcher from the Public Security Bureau, fired a few shots into the village, and then charged into the village. Yan's bandit army abandoned the grain and cattle and fled in panic. The guerrilla group and the self-defense force collected the grain, rounded up the cattle, and returned them all to the masses.
    The struggle at this time was very difficult. Some group members expressed that they could not bear the hardship, and Li Mingzi sincerely told them: "Revolution is hardship!" Old Branch Secretary Li Baorong often said this to the Party members, and Li Mingzi kept it firmly in his mind. On hot days, the guerrilla group was running around in the fields, and someone shouted: "I'm about to die of thirst!" Li Mingzi comforted them: "Revolution is hardship!" When the guerrilla group stayed in the cellar for a long time, some people felt too stuffy and said: "This won't do, we're going to die!" Li Mingzi solemnly said again: "Revolution is hardship!" Sometimes the guerrilla group hid in tombs made of bricks, and in the dog days of summer, the corpses in the coffins emitted a stench that made people unable to breathe. At this time, Li Mingzi encouraged everyone again: "Revolution is hardship!" Everyone felt like they had seen the old branch secretary when they heard this sentence. This sentence had more and more power each time, encouraging everyone to persevere in the struggle.
    In early 1948, Yan's bandit army carried out a large-scale arrest and massacre in the Wenshui Plain. Old Branch Secretary Li Baorong was already over fifty years old and had a lame leg, so he could not participate in the guerrilla group like Li Mingzi and carry out armed struggle. He had to transfer and hide, and continue to carry out secret activities. Once, Yan's bandit army was chasing very closely, and Li Baorong had nowhere to hide. In order to protect the Party's secrets, he was determined not to be captured, so he jumped into a well and died. When Li Mingzi heard this news, he secretly returned to the village and said to his mother: "Mother, I am active outside, and I am determined to fight the enemy. If you are left alone at home and are caught by the enemy, you must not randomly bite comrades. That would be unfair to the Party and to the dead father..." Before his son finished speaking, the mother said loudly: "Go and do your work, put your heart at ease!"
    The struggle entered a more difficult stage. Li Mingzi slept in the fields day and night, and because he caught a cold, he contracted typhoid fever. His mother hid him in an empty courtyard belonging to Communist Party member Wu Maogong. The next day, Yan's bandit army surrounded the courtyard. Li Mingzi had been running a high fever for several days and was extremely weak, but he still picked up the only two grenades he had on hand and struggled to climb into the courtyard. With the last of his strength, he aimed at Yan's bandit army on the roof and threw them. However, Li Mingzi was too sick to throw the grenade onto the roof, and the grenade exploded in the courtyard. Although it did not hit Yan's bandit army on the roof, it scared them enough to fall off the roof. And there was only one grenade left. At this time, Li Mingzi's younger sister ran into the courtyard, crying and wanting to pull him back inside. Li Mingzi thought for a while, he would rather die than be captured, but he also wanted to save his younger sister. So he pressed his little sister to the ground and reached out to detonate the last grenade. Li Mingzi thus gloriously sacrificed himself. Li Mingzi's mother also made up her mind not to be captured, swallowed a piece of opium. The opium's toxicity did not take effect, so she plunged into a water tank and committed suicide. Yan's bandit army revived Li Mingzi's mother, and also attempted to learn about the revolutionary organization of Guanjia Fort from her mouth, in order to completely destroy it. But she cleared all the responsibilities of the people that Yan's bandit army considered suspicious. Overnight, this strong Communist Party member, the mother of a militia martyr, also solemnly died.
    At this time, Yan's bandit army planned to force Wu Maogong to confess the revolutionary organization of Guanjia Fort. They took Wu Maogong back and tortured him for six days and six nights, but they still failed. On the day Wu Maogong was killed, both of his legs had been broken, and he was pushed to Guanjia Fort in a cart. The villagers felt very uncomfortable when they saw it. When Yan's bandit army finally tortured him, he still did not say anything and died heroically.
    The four martyrs sacrificed themselves. But the revolutionary organization of Guanjia Fort was preserved and continued to persist in the struggle against the enemy, until March 8th—the liberation of Wenshui County. (Originally published in "People's Broadcasting," Issue 3)

　　他们为了保存革命组织
    ——记山西文水县贯家堡四位英勇牺牲的共产党员
    梁星
    贯家堡离刘胡兰故乡云周西村只有八里路。在刘胡兰殉难后的一年——一九四八年，贯家堡有四位共产党员，为了保存革命组织，英勇牺牲了自己的生命。其中有三位是一家人——父亲、母亲和儿子。
    父亲名叫李宝荣，是个五十多岁的老贫农。共产党刚到贯家堡秘密活动时，他就加入了党。以后担任了村的支部书记。母亲也是共产党员，在抗日战争时期，她不断带着个篮子，到信贤村日寇据点里侦察日寇的情况。儿子叫李明子，是个年青的共产党员，参加了村里的游击小组，坚持着武装斗争。
    从日本投降到一九四八年夏天，文水平川的人民，一直进行着激烈的对敌斗争。李明子的游击小组只有十来个人，只有几根枪，只有少数子弹，但是，他们坚持着英勇的斗争。一次阎锡山匪军到村里抢粮。游击小组和自卫队转移到村外，向公安局借了一个掷弹筒，往村里发了几炮，接着向村里冲去，阎匪军丢下粮食和耕牛，怆惶逃跑。游击小组与自卫队收起粮食，拢住耕牛，都送还给群众。
    这时的斗争是非常艰苦的。有个别组员表示受不了苦，李明子就诚恳地告诉他们：“革命就是艰苦的！”老支部书记李宝荣常常向党员们讲这句话，李明子把它牢牢地记住了。大热天，游击小组在野地里奔波，有人叫着：“快要渴死人啦！”李明子安慰道：“革命就是艰苦的噢！”游击小组在地窖里呆的时间长了，有人感到太闷气，就说：“这不成，快别死人了！”李明子又郑重地说：“革命就是艰苦的吆！”游击小组有时藏到砖头砌成的坟窟里，在三伏天，棺材里的尸首发出臭气，熏得人喘不上气。这时李明子又鼓励大家说：“革命就是艰苦的啊！”大家听到这句话，就像见到了老支部书记。这句话每一回有一回的力量，鼓励着大家坚持斗争。
    一九四八年初，阎匪军在文水平原上大捕大杀。老支部书记李宝荣已五十多岁，腿又瘸了，不能和李明子一样参加游击小组，进行武装斗争。只好转移隐藏，继续进行秘密活动。有一次，阎匪军追捕甚紧，李宝荣无处躲避，他为了保守党的秘密，决心不当俘虏，就跳井殉难了。李明子听到这个消息，偷偷回到村里，对母亲说：“娘，我在外边活动，我决心和敌人拚了。你一个人留在家里，万一被敌人抓住，你可不能乱咬同志。那样可对不起党，也对不起死了的爹……。”母亲没有等儿子讲完，就大声地说：“快去干你的事情，放你的心吧！”
    斗争进入更加艰苦的阶段，李明子日夜睡在野地里，因为着了凉，得了伤寒病。母亲把他藏到共产党员武茂功的一个空院里，第二天，阎匪军包围了这座院子。李明子发了几天高烧，身体软弱极了，但他仍然拿起手边仅有的两颗手榴弹，挣扎着爬到院里，拼着全身最后的力气，对准房上的阎匪军扔过去。但是，李明子已病得没有力量把手榴弹抛到房上，手榴弹在院子里爆炸了。虽然它没有打中房上的阎匪军，但也把这些人吓得掉下房去。而手里只有一颗手榴弹。这时，李明子的妹妹跑到院里来，哭着要拉他回到里边去。李明子想了想，宁死不当俘虏，但又想救出妹妹。于是他把小妹妹按倒在地上，伸手拉响最后一颗手榴弹。李明子就这样壮烈的牺牲了。李明子母亲也抱了不当俘虏的决心，吞了一块鸦片，鸦片的毒性没有发作，她就栽到水缸里自杀了。阎匪军弄活了李明子的母亲，还企图从她口中了解贯家堡的革命组织，以便彻底破坏。但她把阎匪军认为嫌疑的人的责任，统统洗刷得干干净净。过了一夜，这个坚强的共产党员，民兵烈士的母亲，也庄严地死去了。
    这时，阎匪军就计划强迫武茂功供出贯家堡的革命组织。他们把武茂功带回去，拷问了六天六夜，但是仍然失败了。武茂功被杀害的那天，两条腿已经被打断了，是用小车推到贯家堡来的。村里人看了非常难受。当阎匪军最后拷问他的时候，他仍旧什么也没有讲，英勇的就义了。
    四位烈士是牺牲了。但是贯家堡的革命组织却被保存下来，继续坚持对敌斗争，直到三月八日——文水县解放。（原载《人民广播》三期）
