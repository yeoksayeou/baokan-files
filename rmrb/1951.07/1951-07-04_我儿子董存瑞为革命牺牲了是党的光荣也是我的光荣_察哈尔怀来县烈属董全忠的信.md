　　My son, Dong Cunrui, sacrificed himself for the revolution, which is the glory of the Party and my glory
　　--A letter from Dong Quanzhong, a martyr's family member in Huailai County, Chahar

Respected Chairman Mao:

My son, Dong Cunrui, was an excellent Communist Party member. He sacrificed himself for the cause of the people's revolution, not for himself dying in bed. On the occasion of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, I thought of Cunrui's glorious death. His glory is also the glory of the entire Party and you. Although he has been sacrificed for three years, I believe that his spirit and his legacy will forever play an extremely strong role in the hearts of the soldiers. Today, I would like to report to you on the current living conditions of my family.

Chairman Mao, I would like to thank you and the Party first. There are now four people in my family, with thirty-six mu of land, living a middle-peasant life, with no shortage of food or fuel. The village takes care of us very well, and the days are very comfortable. I am fifty-two years old this year, and my labor is a bit weak. The villagers have designated fifty substitute workers for me, and they plant and hoe first. They are also afraid that I have difficulty getting water, so they have assigned me a long-term water-carrying service worker, delivering two or three loads of water every day. I don't want them to do that, so I fight to do it myself, but the masses reply, "If there were no heroic sacrifices, there would be no liberation for us. Don't forget the people who grow the grain when you eat." No matter what they say, I always think that labor is glorious. During the New Year and festivals, the village always holds me in high regard for everything big and small. For example, at the end of last year and this spring, I was subsidized with more than 300 jin of grain twice. They sent white flour, pasted Spring Festival couplets, hung lanterns, and swept the yard for the New Year, with everything available, without any difficulties.

Chairman Mao: Cunrui died for the people, and his glory will last forever, and his spirit will live forever. Last August, the Northeast People's Liberation Army sent me two sets of "Hero Model" clothes (No. 1430), a (bravery) medal, 5.1 million yuan in RMB, and items such as a fountain pen and a diary. His younger brother, Cunjin, was only seventeen years old. When he saw these things and knew their origin, he said, "My brother was loyal to the war of resistance and contributed to the country. When I grow up, I will learn from him." This April, our Seventh District People's Government and 4,100 people from 26 villages held a public memorial meeting for Cunrui on Qingming Festival. County Head Guo Hong personally presided over the ceremony. The memorial platform was filled with elegiac couplets and wreaths in memory of Cunrui. Everyone paid their deep condolences to the martyred hero. After the meeting, County Head Guo Hong and Zhang Qiang of the County Communist Youth League Committee cordially慰问ed our family members and helped solve all the difficulties. In June, the County People's Government built a martyr's shrine for Cunrui and erected two stone tablets. The words "Hero Cunrui, his spirit will live forever" and "Eternal glory, immortal forever" were engraved on them, along with his heroic deeds. They also renovated our broken earthen gate into a new brick gatehouse and presented two horizontal wooden plaques, with the large characters "Centuries of glory" and "Heroic spirit forever". In this way, I felt an unparalleled glory. I wrote to the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army and the entire army, reporting this situation, encouraging them to fight bravely, study military technology well, eliminate the enemy, and strive to be heroic models.

Chairman Mao: As soon as the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea began, I actively participated in the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement. There are a total of eighteen households of martyrs' families and military families in our village. In the upsurge of bumper harvest competition, I led them to make plans. This year, we hoed the land one more time, applied three more loads of fertilizer per mu, and also improved the technology of seed soaking and mixing. Every family has seed plots, and all the labor force participated in the work allocation team. Everyone has raised their political awareness. They all realize that national interests come first, break the idea of dependence, and automatically write letters to the soldiers at the front, telling them not to worry about their families, to concentrate on practicing martial arts, and to focus on eliminating the enemy and defending peace.

Since the day the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the Korean War, the victories of the Chinese and North Korean people have followed one after another, and we have become more and more excited. We also work hard to produce, like other farmers, to support the Volunteers.

Chairman Mao: Today I attended the county's labor model representative conference for families of martyrs and military personnel, wearing a red flower on my chest. Let me say one more thing, Cunrui's sacrifice is glorious. The place where he died for the country, Longhua Middle School, has been renamed Cunrui Middle School. Now the whole country is enthusiastically responding to the call to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons. Huailai County has decided to donate a "Dong Cunrui" airplane to commemorate the martyr's achievements. Although he has been sacrificed for three years, his spirit, his glory, is always before my eyes, always alive in the hearts of the people. I wish you good health forever!

　　我儿子董存瑞为革命牺牲了是党的光荣也是我的光荣           
    ——察哈尔怀来县烈属董全忠的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我的儿子董存瑞是个优秀的共产党员，他是为人民革命事业而牺牲，不是为自己死在炕头上。在庆祝中国共产党三十周年生日的时候，我就想起存瑞死的光荣。他的光荣也是全党和您的光荣。他虽然牺牲三年了，但是他的精神，他的遗志，我相信永远会在战士们心上起着坚强无比的作用，今天，我想向您报告一下目前我家庭的生活情况。
    毛主席，我先向您和党致谢。我们家里现在有四口人，三十六亩地，过着中农生活，不缺吃，不短烧，村里照顾非常周到，日子很舒心。我今年五十二岁了，劳动上差点劲，村里民众就给确定了五十个代耕工，并且先种先锄。还怕我吃水困难，长年给派上挑水勤务工，每天送水两、三担。我落意不过，争着干，群众回答：“若没有英雄的牺牲，就没有我们的翻身，吃饭不忘种谷人。”不管他们怎样说，我总认为劳动是光荣的。过年过节，村里有点大小事，总把我抬举的很高。比方去年的年底和今春，两次给我补助粮三百多斤，过大年送白面，贴对联，挂灯笼，扫院子，应有尽有，没一点困难。
    毛主席：存瑞为人民而死，光荣永在，精神永存。去年八月间，东北人民解放军给我寄来“英模”衣服两件（一四三○号），（勇敢）奖章一枚，人民币五十一万元，和钢笔、日记本等物品。他弟弟存金才十七岁，见到这些东西，知道了来历，他就说：“我哥哥忠心抗战，为国争光有功。我大了向他学习。”今年四月里，我们七区人民政府及二十六个村四千一百多人，在清明节那天，举行公祭存瑞的大会。由郭洪县长亲临主祭，公祭台前布满了对存瑞追颂的挽联、花圈。大家都向殉难烈士致以沉痛的哀悼。会后有县长郭洪，团县委张强亲切慰问了我们家属，帮助解决了一切困难。六月间，县人民政府就给存瑞修盖了烈士祠堂，立起石碑两座。上边刻着“存瑞英雄，精神长存”，“万古千秋，永垂不朽”等字，刻上了他的英勇事迹。并把我家的破土门，给修盖了一个新砖门楼，赠送了两幅横木匾，大字刻着“百世光辉”、“英风千古”。这样，我越觉着无尚的光荣。我就向第四野战军政治部和全军去了信，报告了这个情况，鼓励他们勇敢的战斗，好好学习军事技术，消灭敌人，争取做英雄模范。
    毛主席：抗美援朝一开始，我就积极地参加了反帝爱国运动。我村烈属军属共十八户。在丰产竞赛热潮里边，我带动他们作计划。今年多锄一遍地，每亩多上肥料三驮，把浸拌种的技术也提高了一步，家家有留种地，是劳动力都参加了拨工组。大家都提高了政治觉悟。都认识到国家利益第一，打破依赖思想，都自动地给前方战士去信，叫他们不用惦念家里，安心练武艺，光谋着消灭敌人，保卫和平。
    当中国志愿军参加朝鲜战争那天起，中朝人民的胜利接着胜利，我们兴奋越加兴奋。我们也与其他农民一样的努力生产，支援志愿军。
    毛主席：今天我出席了全县烈属军属劳动模范代表大会，胸前戴上红花一朵。让我再说一句，存瑞牺牲的光荣。他殉国有名的地方——隆化中学，已经改名为存瑞中学。现在全国正在热烈响应增产捐献飞机大炮的号召，怀来县决定捐一架“董存瑞号”飞机，纪念烈士的功绩。他虽然牺牲了三年了，但是他的精神，他的光荣，永远在我眼前，永远活在人们的心里。敬祝你身体永远健康！
