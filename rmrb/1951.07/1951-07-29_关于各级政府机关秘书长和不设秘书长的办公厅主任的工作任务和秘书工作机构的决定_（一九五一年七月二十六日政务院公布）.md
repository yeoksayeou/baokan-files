According to the reports and speeches of representatives from various regions and departments at the National Secretaries-General Conference, over the past year, the secretarial work organizations and cadres of the people's governments at all levels above the provincial (municipal) level have been largely established and equipped, and have done a great deal of work and achieved considerable success. However, due to the short time and lack of experience, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the work. Some problems are difficult to make uniform and specific decisions due to the different working conditions and cadre conditions in various regions and departments. Now, based on the actual situation and the results of the Secretaries-General Conference, the following principled decisions are made on the work tasks of the Secretaries-General and Directors of General Offices without Secretaries-General, and the secretarial work organization, in the hope that all regions and departments will follow them on a trial basis.

I. Work Tasks

	(1) Assist the leaders in comprehensively understanding the situation, researching policies, and promoting work;
	(2) Assist the leaders in closely connecting the work of all aspects;
	(3) Assist the leaders in managing the internal united front work of the organization;
	(4) Assist the leaders in managing confidential work;
	(5) Manage confidential work;
	(6) Preside over daily administrative affairs (including document processing, meeting organization, inspection and supervision of the implementation of government resolutions, etc.);
	(7) Manage the organization's administrative work (including the organization's finances, life management, learning, cultural and recreational activities, etc. - however, in organizations without Secretaries-General, if there are special organizations outside the General Office to manage administrative work, this work may not be managed by the Director of the General Office).

II. Several Basic Issues for Doing a Good Job

The nature of the work of the Secretary-General and the Director of the General Office is to participate in political affairs and manage affairs at the same time. At present, when the foundation of secretarial work is generally still weak, to do these important and complex tasks well, it is necessary to:

Familiarize yourself with policies and laws, create and accumulate experience in continuous study and practice; establish and improve the working system of the organization, strengthen planning and organization, in order to strive for initiative in work; pay attention to close contact between the secretarial departments of people's governments at all levels, and frequently exchange working experience in various places; vigorously cultivate new cadres and improve the policy and cultural level and working ability of old cadres; and overcome and prevent the ideological tendencies of being too eager for success or lacking confidence.

Always pay attention to grasping the working method of "grasping the key points and taking care of the overall situation". The focus should be on assisting the leaders in researching policies and handling political affairs; but at the same time, the daily administrative work and the administrative work of the organization should be organized and arranged well, so that they can be advanced in an orderly manner. Learn to concentrate energy and time to think, study, and deal with major issues; and also learn to take the time to guide or personally handle specific daily work with emphasis.

Implement the principle of "centralized leadership, division of labor and responsibility". According to the needs of actual work, divide the responsibilities of each staff member, so that there is no phenomenon of uneven workload in the organization. Between the chief and deputy, under the principle of the deputy assisting the chief, clarify the division of labor according to the subordinate business units or specific tasks, let go of work within a certain scope of responsibility, and boldly deal with problems. Between different levels, strengthen hierarchical responsibility according to the nature of the work. General daily work should be released as much as possible, and handled by various divisions and sections. Do not concentrate everything on the top, trapping yourself in the circle of事務主義.

Always pay attention to understanding and handling problems conscientiously within your own scope of responsibility according to the intentions of the leadership, so that the leaders can reduce the entanglement of affairs and consider major issues more. And pay attention to understanding and mastering the rules of handling affairs in actual work, distinguishing which problems can be handled by yourself, which problems can be handled and reported to the leaders, and which problems must be reported for instructions before handling, avoiding the phenomenon of daring not to be responsible when encountering problems, and preventing the deviation of acting beyond authority.

Always pay attention to understanding the work trends of various departments, and in the spirit of "starting from the whole and taking care of the specific situation", closely connect the work of various departments, so that nothing is omitted, and the goal of coordinated steps and unified government orders is achieved. And adopt a humble attitude and a consultative approach to handling affairs, so that the departments feel that they are helped and facilitated, and that there is no feeling of increased trouble and difficulty.

Require every cadre in the secretarial work department to recognize that their work is a very important part of the government's work. Not only in words, but also in actual actions, completely combine personal work interests and personal ambition with the overall interests of the people's cause, stick to their posts, and work hard. Have the determination and perseverance to "do everything to the end, to achieve practical results", "be good at correcting ten times, redoing ten times, but in any case, to achieve their own goals" (Lenin: How should office workers work). Develop a working attitude of hard work and a humble, prudent, meticulous, and practical working style.

Another important factor in doing a good job is that the leaders must earnestly take responsibility, strengthen the policy and ideological leadership of the Secretary-General and the secretarial work cadres, consciously tell them their intentions and understanding, and in actual work, try their best to support them to let go of their work, help them improve their policy and ideological and working abilities, and develop correct working attitudes and working methods. At the same time, in order to avoid concentrating all affairs on the Secretary-General or the Director, pay attention to appropriately equipping them with deputies, dividing responsibilities, so that they can have a certain amount of time to study policies, have the opportunity to participate in and understand the actual work dynamics and business conditions, so that policy research can be closely integrated with various actual businesses and various mass movements.

III. Organization

The secretarial work organization should strive to reduce levels in accordance with the principle of streamlining. The General Office can generally be divided into two levels, and no more than three levels at most. For the convenience of work, more deputies can be set up to lead the work. The General Office of the Provincial (Municipal) People's Government, which has not yet set up a special Director, may be concurrently held by the Secretary-General or Deputy Secretary-General, and a full-time Deputy Director may be set up if necessary.

Adapt to the division of business, the organizational structure can be appropriately developed horizontally, and gradually change the one-size-fits-all organizational form that is too large and too much. When conditions permit, the secretarial business, research work, and the administrative management work of the organization can be separated. The specific establishment should be decided according to the specific circumstances of each region and department.

Try to reduce事務人员 and enrich business departments. A quota system can be tried for some personnel (such as receiving and dispatching, writing, etc.), and the establishment of guards and miscellaneous personnel should also be more rationally regulated in order to achieve the purpose of streamlining, saving, and improving work efficiency.

The policy research institutions of the Greater Administrative Regions and the Provincial (Municipal) People's Governments should be established according to the specific working conditions and cadre conditions in each place. If the cadre conditions are difficult and a special institution cannot be established, several cadres with a certain policy level and practical work experience can be set up, and a number of intellectual cadres with a higher level of education can be equipped, and they can be trained to assist the Secretary-General in researching certain policy issues by using the method of apprenticeship, and they should be allowed to participate in inspection and inspection work, which is very necessary at present. These personnel can be included in the Counselor's Office, the Secretary's Office, or directly under the leadership of the Secretary-General in terms of establishment, depending on the specific circumstances.

　　关于各级政府机关秘书长和不设秘书长的办公厅主任的工作任务和秘书工作机构的决定
　  （一九五一年七月二十六日政务院公布）
    根据全国秘书长会议各地区、各部门代表的报告和发言，一年来全国省（市）以上各级人民政府的秘书工作机构和干部，已大体建立和配备起来，做了许多工作，获有相当成绩。但由于时间短、经验少，工作中还存在着许多缺点和问题。有些问题，因各个地区、各个部门工作情况和干部状况不同，尚难做出统一具体的决定。现在根据实际情况和秘书长会议讨论结果，将秘书长和不设秘书长的办公厅主任的工作任务和秘书工作机构等问题，作如下原则性的决定，希望各地区、各部门遵照试行。
  一、工作任务
    （一）协助首长综合情况，研究政策，推行工作；
    （二）协助首长密切各方面的工作联系；
    （三）协助首长掌管机关内部统一战线工作；
    （四）协助首长掌管保密工作；
    （五）掌管机要工作；
    （六）主持日常行政事务（包括公文处理、会议组织、检查与督促政府决议的执行等事项）；
    （七）掌管机关事务工作（包括机关财务、生活管理、学习、文化娱乐活动等事项。——但不设秘书长的机关，如在办公厅之外专设机构管理机关事务工作者，此项工作可不由办公厅主任掌管）。
  二、做好工作的几个基本问题
    秘书长和办公厅主任工作的性质是既要参与政务又要掌管事务，在目前秘书工作基础一般还是薄弱的情况下，要做好这些重要而复杂的工作，就必须：
    在不断努力学习和实践中，熟悉政策法令，创造和积累经验；建立与健全机关的工作制度，加强计划性和组织性，以争取工作上的主动；注意密切各级人民政府秘书部门间的联系，经常交流各地工作经验；大力培养新干部和提高老干部的政策、文化水平和工作能力；并克服与防止求成过急或缺乏信心的思想倾向。
    经常注意掌握“抓住重点，照顾全盘”的工作方法。重点应该放在协助首长研究政策，处理政务方面；但同时要把日常行政工作和机关事务工作组织安排好，使之有条不紊地顺序推进。要学会既善于集中精力时间，思考、钻研、处理重大问题；又善于抽出精力时间，有重点地指导处理或亲自处理日常具体的工作。
    贯彻执行“集中领导，分工负责”的原则。要根据实际工作需要，划分每个工作人员的职责，做到机关没有忙闲不均现象。正副职之间，应在副职协助正职的原则下，根据所属业务单位或各项具体工作，明确分工，在一定职责范围之内，放手工作，大胆处理问题。各级之间，应按照工作性质，加强分层负责，一般日常工作，尽量放下去，由各处、科负责处理，不要事事集中到上面，把自己陷在事务主义的圈子里边。
    经常注意领会并根据领导上的意图，主动地在自己职责范围内，认真处理问题，使首长减少事务纠缠，多考虑重大问题。并注意在实际工作中，体会与掌握办事规律，分清那些问题可以自己处理，那些问题可以处理后报告首长，那些问题必须请示后再处理，避免遇事不敢负责现象，并防止越权行事的偏向。
    经常注意了解各部门工作动向，本着“从整体出发，照顾具体情况”的精神，密切各部门工作的联系，使事无疏漏，达到步调协调、政令统一的目的。并应采取谦虚态度和商讨办事的方式，使各部门觉得对他们有帮助、有便利，而无增加麻烦和困难的感觉。
    要求每个秘书工作部门的干部，认清自己的工作，是政府工作中很重要的一部分。不仅在口头上，而且在实际行动中，把个人的工作兴趣，个人事业心完全结合于人民事业的整体利益中，坚守岗位，埋头苦干。要有把“每件事都能做到底，做到有实际的结果”，“善于成十次地修正，成十次地重做，但是无论如何，要达到自己的目的”（列宁：论机关工作人员应如何工作）的决心和毅力。要养成任劳任怨的工作态度和谦虚、谨慎、细密、切实的工作作风。
    做好工作的另一个重要因素，就是首长必须切实负责，加强对秘书长和秘书工作干部的政策思想领导，经常有意识地把自己的意图和认识告诉他们，在实际工作中，尽量支持他们放手工作，帮助提高他们的政策思想和工作能力，养成正确的工作态度和工作方法。同时为避免将一切事务，都集中在秘书长或主任身上，还要注意适当地为他们配备副职，分工负责，使他们能够有一定的时间研究政策，有机会参加和了解实际工作动态和业务状况，使政策研究能够和各项实际业务和各种群众运动密切结合进行。
  三、组织机构
    秘书工作机构，应根据精简原则，尽力减少层次。办公厅，一般可分设两层，最多不超过三层。为便利工作，可多设副职，分工领导。省（市）人民政府的办公厅，尚未专设主任者，得由秘书长或副秘书长兼任，必要时另设专职的副主任。
    适应业务分工，组织机构可适当向横的方面发展，逐渐改变过大过多的一揽子的组织形式。条件许可时，可把秘书业务、研究工作、机关事务管理工作划分开来，具体编制应依各地区各部门具体情况决定。
    尽量减少事务人员，充实业务部门。在部分人员中（如收发、缮写等），可试行定额制，警卫勤杂人员的编制，亦应更合理规定，以达精简节约提高工作效能的目的。
    大行政区和各省（市）人民政府的政策研究机构，应视各地具体工作情况和干部条件建立。如干部条件困难，不能专设机构时，可设几个具有一定政策水平和实际工作经验的干部，并配备若干文化程度较高的知识分子干部，用带徒弟的方法，培养他们协助秘书长进行某些政策问题的研究，并应让他们参加巡视检查工作，这在目前是十分必要的。这些人员在编制上或列入参事室、秘书室或直归秘书长领导，可依据具体情形而定。
