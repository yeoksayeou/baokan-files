　　One Factory Originally Used the Funds of Two Factories!
　  ——Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Achieves Major Success in Capital Verification

  　A Striking Contrast
    The work of clearing assets and verifying capital, which began in April this year at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, has laid an important foundation for the implementation of economic accounting at the plant.
    Before the capital verification, the actual capital put into circulation was more than 25% higher than the capital invested by the state; but after the capital verification, the actual capital put into circulation by the plant decreased by 54% compared to the capital invested by the state. The turnover rate rapidly increased from 1.133 times in 1950 to 4.24 times. The turnover time also decreased from 321 days in 1950 to 85 days. This has saved the state operating capital equivalent to building 1.2 identical factories, which is about 274% of the state's basic construction investment in the plant this year. This means that in the past, even with huge state funding, the plant still did not have enough; now, with more than half the capital reduced, it can still circulate freely. This striking contrast illustrates the significant role of capital verification.
        Serious Backlog and Poor Circulation in the Past
    Why is there such a stark contrast?
    First, the plant's funds had a serious backlog and poor circulation in the past.
    Before this capital review, the working capital allocated to the plant by the state should have been far more than sufficient, based on the plant's past and current production and sales needs. This is because, according to the 1951 financial plan prepared by the plant during this capital verification, the reasonable quota for the total capital requirement for the first and second quarters of the plant was 62% less than the working capital invested by the state. However, in reality, the plant still experienced imbalances in revenue and expenditure and difficulties in capital turnover in the first and second quarters of this year. (For example, in April, the plant relied on the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry to temporarily divert 6 billion yuan of funds from other units due to capital turnover difficulties.) As a result, even the profits and depreciation that should have been turned over to the state and the funds for accounts payable were put into circulation, while the actual capital that could circulate was only about a quarter of the total capital. This shows how serious the capital backlog was!
    Here is a table listing the working capital situation of the plant before the rectification in March:
    Assets                  Amount  Percentage  Liabilities                    Amount Percentage
    Raw Materials           49.59             State-Invested Working Capital  76.96
    Finished Products (Including Semi-Finished Products)  17.78    Funds Payable to the Government    5.74
    Interactions with the General Bureau      16.63             Surplus to be Delivered (Previous and Current Year)  9.77
    Interactions with Bureau Affiliates   0.58                Accounts Payable              5.24
    Accounts Receivable         8.68                Expenses Payable              0.60
    Deferred Assets           1.39                Temporary Receipts              1.96
    Supplies and Consumable Tools      0.62                Temporary Payments            3.91
    Bank Deposits             0.81
    Total                     100                 Total                            100

    According to the table, the capital backlog in materials, finished products, and accounts receivable alone occupied more than three-quarters of the total capital.
    Second, in the past, the plant used funds without any clear understanding or planning, leading to chaos and passivity in its work.
    Due to a lack of planning and necessary reasonable quotas (such as raw material reserve quotas, finished product, re-product, and semi-finished product quotas, etc.), everyone was unclear about the situation. At the same time, there was a top-down mentality of "better to overestimate and use sparingly, better to be prepared than not," so everyone took the attitude that the more raw materials were reserved, the better. The monthly budgets submitted by each workshop were very large, and their thinking was that it was better to hoard than to run out, more was always better than less. The supply department, because it had no plan as a basis for assessment, could not understand the consumption of raw materials and was also afraid that "untimely supply would delay production"; therefore, even though it knew that the budget was too large, it had to fulfill every request, regardless of whether the finance department had money or not. The finance department was then left to busy itself with raising funds all day long. This resulted in the most serious capital backlog in raw materials. Taking only the main raw materials into account, by the end of the year, the plant had a backlog of 28,659 tons of Jinlingzhen ore; 3,509 tons of manganese ore, enough for 97 days; 15,258 tons of Kailuan special fine coal, enough for 65 days; and 32,712 tons of Kailuan special-grade fine coal, enough for 43 days. These excessive reserves tied up more than 10 billion yuan in capital. On the other hand, the supply department and the finance department had no contact and lost their supervisory role over financial activities, leading to the mixing and misappropriation of funds, thereby violating financial regulations.
  Supply System Created a Dependent Mentality
    After liberation, the plant had carried out three inventories and two valuations. In the first half of 1950, the plant conducted a relatively thorough inventory and valuation of all assets, finding 12.38 billion yuan of materials off the books, handing over 26.43 billion yuan of materials to the state; and revalued and classified all assets for accounting purposes. This gave the factory correct and detailed statistics and records of all assets, initially established some management systems, and generally increased the staff's emphasis on and care for people's property, thereby greatly helping the circulation and use of funds.
    But, despite this, why did the serious backlog and poor circulation mentioned above still occur? This is because the long-term supply system created a dependent mentality and a lack of emphasis on business management.
    Before January 1951, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau adopted a system of centralized control and allocation of funds for its affiliated factories and mines. Factories were only responsible for completing production tasks, and could not be held responsible for controlling supply and sales and financial turnover. This created a dependent mentality in the factories, causing comrades to not care whether funds were flowing or not, treating the backlog as the responsibility of the higher authorities, thereby neglecting efforts in business management.
    This thinking was first manifested in a lack of concern for product backlog, not actively organizing sales, not considering whether the price was reasonable, only pursuing the quantity of certain products without considering whether their specifications met market needs. Order placement did not start from sales, and there was reluctance to accept small orders, fearing trouble. There was a lack of enthusiasm for timely clearing of creditor and debtor relationships. There was a failure to actively and promptly collect outstanding payments. The method of delaying payment was adopted for accounts payable. The amount of raw materials reserved was hoped to be as much as possible, only caring about ensuring supply, regardless of whether it was a backlog. In short, cadres engaged in financial supply work never calculated matters such as capital turnover and revenue and expenditure.
    It can be clearly seen that this supply system situation created a supply system mentality; and the supply system mentality promoted blindness and chaos in capital management. This also illustrates the necessity of clearing assets and re-verifying capital.
  How is Working Capital Verified?
    How was the plant's working capital verified? Very briefly put, it was mainly:
    First, through clearing, the true situation of its own working capital was clearly known. By actively handling creditor and debtor relationships, revaluing and devaluing materials, and separating fixed assets mixed in with working capital and cold waste materials in raw materials, the funds actually circulating before clearing were reduced somewhat.
    The increase or decrease in existing working capital after consolidation compared to before consolidation is listed in the table below:
    Asset Subject           After Consolidation        Percentage Increase/Decrease Compared to Before Consolidation
    Raw Materials           47.38                    Decrease 2.21
    Finished Products (Including Semi-Finished Products)  30.37      Increase 12.59
    Deferred Assets           1.75                    Increase 0.36
    Interactions with the General Bureau      12.08                    Decrease 4.55
    Interactions with Bureau Affiliates    1.75                    Increase 1.17
    Accounts Receivable         1.94                    Decrease 6.74
    Supplies and Tools in Use     0.53                    Decrease 0.09
    Temporary Payments          3.46                    Decrease 0.45
    Cash                      0.73                    Decrease 0.09
    Total                     100

  Liability and Net Worth Subject      After Consolidation        Percentage Increase/Decrease Compared to Before Consolidation
    State-Allocated Own Working Capital    86.64                    Increase 9.68
    Funds Payable to the Government        0.82                    Decrease 9.92
    Surplus to be Delivered          2.98                    Decrease 6.79
    Accounts Payable              0.76                    Decrease 4.48
    Expenses Payable              2.77                    Increase 2.17
    Temporary Receipts              0.32                    Decrease 1.37
    Other                      2.86                    Increase 2.86
    Major Repair Reserve          0.88                    Increase 0.88
    Advance Deposit              1.97                    Increase 1.97
    Total                     100

    The total amount of working capital after consolidation listed in the above table ("Total") is 91% of that before consolidation. This shows that fixed assets were mixed in with working capital before consolidation; the valuation of working capital was too high or too low; and cold waste materials were not well handled. Therefore, there were increases and decreases in each item of working capital after consolidation compared to before consolidation. This also shows that the true situation of working capital became clear after consolidation.
    Second, after initially clarifying the true situation of its own working capital, the 1951 financial plan was prepared. After concrete calculations, the average fixed number of days of various capital turnover periods and the required amount of money were determined based on the actual needs of all aspects. This found the reasonable figure for the amount of working capital required by the factory.
    The percentages of each item of the planned working capital requirement are listed in the table below:
    (According to expert opinion, the plant should be calculated according to the fourth quarter for the first implementation of economic accounting system.)
    Item                        Average Fixed Number of Days Amount Percentage
    Raw Materials and Main Materials     33                          25.8
    Auxiliary Materials               77                          14.7
    Spare Parts in Reserve            120                          1.1
    Equipment Replacement             120                          1.1
    Tools and Consumables             120                          1.71
    Fuel                            15                          6
    Semi-Finished Products              13                          1.7
    Work-in-Progress                 1.1                          2.1
    Finished Products                  28                          38.3
    Advance Payments and Deferred Expenses  250                          6.8
    Total                                                       100

    The total amount of working capital required after verification listed in the above table ("Total") is 54% less than the working capital originally invested by the state (that is, the "State-Invested Working Capital" item in the "Liabilities" of the working capital situation table before consolidation).
  Capital Verification Dispelled the Idea That "The More Funds, the Better"
    After the capital was verified, the plant achieved great success in business management. Because a large amount of capital was verified and reduced, a large amount of wealth equal to 54% of the original amount of working capital was returned to the state. Therefore, waste was reduced, capital turnover was accelerated, and the plant was able to obtain greater profits with less capital. This achievement is mainly reflected in the fact that the comrades in the plant have undergone great changes in their thinking and work.
    First of all, they changed their thinking that "the more funds, the better" and "more is always better than less", clearly recognizing that the need for working capital must start from reality, more is useless, it can only form a backlog, less cannot guarantee turnover, hindering supply and production. Both are detrimental to the state and the factory.
    After a large amount of capital was verified and reduced at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, they were not afraid that the funds would not be enough, but instead felt more confident and confident. But it must be pointed out that this was the result of a difficult working process and struggle process for the comrades in the plant.
    For example, when the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau convened a capital meeting in April this year, it put forward opinions on the control figures for working capital of various plants. As a result, it encountered universal controversy and was difficult for the plants to accept. The plant refused to accept it no matter what, put forward various reasons, and strived for more funds. In the end, it was determined that it was a preliminary control figure, and the plant reluctantly accepted it, but the mood was very dissatisfied. At that time, the comrades in charge of financial management felt: "In the past, the actual funds we circulated were more than 25% higher than the state's investment, but we still couldn't circulate them; now the funds stipulated by the bureau are actually half less than the state's investment, how can we circulate them?" When the higher authorities mobilized the plant to implement the economic accounting system, these comrades still held the attitude that "it's just a rough job! There will always be problems if there is less funds." Even when preparing the plan, they still had the idea that "more funds are always better than less". In order to put together more funds, the inventory was set too high, and the sales aspect was estimated too low. In the process of preparing the plan, through practical calculations, coupled with the help of Soviet experts in theory and calculation methods, this idea was truly transformed. With this transformation, solving other problems had a prerequisite.
    Secondly, in terms of work, due to the implementation of independent operation and the beginning of planned management in capital, this basically ended the state of being unclear about the situation in the past, turning work from passive to active, and unprecedentedly improving the enthusiasm for business management.
    Through capital verification and plan preparation, many problems have been clarified, everyone has a bottom line, knows the revenue and expenditure situation and capital needs in various periods, understands the consumption of raw materials and the supply and sales tasks, and has a financial supply plan as a basis for assessment and a direction for efforts. Because of the implementation of independent operation, the concept of supply system has been changed, so they said: "Whether the work is done well or not in the future is all our own business!" In this way, a new look immediately appeared in the work.
    After the plan was completed and the capital was verified at the plant, the factory's financial and supply work immediately showed unprecedented enthusiasm and initiative. First of all, the capital needs and raw material reserve quotas must start from reality, not too much or too little. Purchase and sales contracts must be signed to ensure prices and specifications to suit the market and open up sales channels. At the same time, attention should be paid to solving problems that occur in the work immediately to ensure the needs of capital turnover. For example, in the past, the finance department and the transportation station signed supply and procurement contracts, but because there was insufficient contact with the supply department, the problem of the prepayment period being too long occurred. This problem has now been solved. Another example is that in the past, not enough attention was paid to urging the collection of debts. After the capital was sorted out, they immediately urged the collection and payment of debts by letter and telegram. The supply department never cared about product backlog in the past, but now in May alone, it sold 25,936,360,000 yuan of products, and sold 1,000 tons of coke powder and 60 tons of coal washing stone. The attitude of the workshops is also different. In the past, they were unwilling to accept small orders. Now, several factories have come to order goods, with many types and complicated processing, but the workshops immediately agreed to make them. At the same time, the workshops no longer submit huge budgets casually. Even if they want to increase production or have extra needs, they first notify the supply department to see if the supply plan has any preparation. In short, everything has changed! This shows the huge driving force of the economic accounting system, and further proves that the idea that "the more working capital, the better" is obviously incorrect.

　　一个厂原来用着两个厂的资金！
　  ——石景山钢铁厂核定资金获重大成绩
　　丁琦
  　鲜明的对比
    石景山钢铁厂在今年四月份开始进行的清理资材核定资金的工作，已给该厂实行经济核算制打下了重要的基础。
    该厂在核定资金之前，实际加入周转的资金比国家投入的资金要增高百分之二十五以上；但在核定资金之后，该厂实际加入周转的资金却比国家投入的资金减少百分之五十四。周转率从一九五○年的一点一三三次，迅速提升至四点二四次。周转时间从一九五○年的三百二十一天，也降到八十五天。这样就给国家节省了等于办同样的一点二个工厂的经营本钱，约合于本年度国家给予该厂基本建设投资的百分之二百七十四。这就是说，过去该厂有着国家巨额资金还不够用；现在减少一半以上的资金还周转自如。这个鲜明的对比，说明了核定资金的作用是很大的。
        过去是严重积压与周转不灵
    为什么会有这样鲜明的对比呢？
    第一是该厂的资金过去有着严重积压与周转不灵的现象。
    在此次整理资金前，国家拨给该厂的流动资金，按该厂过去与目前生产及供销所需的资金来看，应当是大大过剩的。因为根据该厂此次核定资金时编制的一九五一年财务计划，该厂第一、第二两季全部资金需要量的合理定额比国家投入的流动资金减少百分之六十二。然而实际上该厂在今年第一、二季仍然发生收支不平衡与资金周转困难的现象。（如该厂四月份曾因资金周转困难，依靠中央重工业部钢铁工业局代挪用其他单位的资金六十亿元。）这样，甚至将应解缴国家的利润及折旧与应付料款等资金也已加入周转，而真正能周转的资金却仅为全部资金的四分之一左右。由此可以看到资金积压情况曾是何等严重！
    这里把该厂在三月份整顿前的流动资金情况列表如下：资    产      金额百分比  负    债    金额百分比原材料        四九·五九  国家投入流动资金      七六·九六成品（包括在制半制品）  一七·七八  应解缴政府款  五·七四总局往来      一六·六三  应解盈余（上年及本年）  九·七七局属往来      ○·五八    应付料款      五·二四应收账款      八·六八    应付费用      ○·六○递延资产      一·三九    暂收款        一·九六用品及消耗工具          ○·六二暂付款        三·九一银行存款      ○·八一合计          一○○      合计        一○○
    根据上表，可以看出，仅在材料、成品及应收账款方面的资金积压即占用全部资金的四分之三以上。
    第二是该厂过去心中无数，无计划地使用资金，使工作陷入紊乱与被动。
    由于缺乏计划与各项必需的合理定额（如原材料储备定额，成品、再制品、半制品的定额等），这样就使得大家心中无数。同时自上而下又存在宽打紧用有备无患的思想，所以对于原材料的储备，就都抱着愈多愈好的态度。各车间每月所提出的预算十分庞大，他们的思想是宁可囤积，不要不够用，多总比少好。供应部门因为没有计划作为考核的依据，也不能了解原材料的消耗状况，又怕“供应不及时耽误生产”；于是明知预算太大，也只好有求必应，不管财务部门有钱无钱。财务部门则只有整天忙着张罗款子。这样，一方面使资金在原材料方面的积压最为严重。仅以主要原材料计算，至本年底该厂积压金岭镇矿石二万八千六百五十九吨；锰矿储存九十七天共三千五百零九吨；开滦特特末煤存六十五天一万五千二百五十八吨；开滦特号末煤存四十三天三万二千七百一十二吨。这些超额储备，即积压了一百多亿资金。另一方面，供应部门与财务部门既没有联系，也失去对财务活动的监督作用，造成了资金的混用和挪用的现象，从而违犯了财务制度。
  供给制度造成了依赖思想
    该厂解放后，曾进行过三次清点，两次估价。在一九五○年上半年，该厂对全部资产进行了一次比较彻底的清查估价工作，查出账外器材一百二十三点八亿元，为国家上缴了二百六十四点三亿元的物资；并对全部资产作了重新估价和分类登账，这样就使工厂对全部资产有了正确的和详细的数字统计与各种记载，初步建立了一些管理制度，使职工普遍提高了对人民财产的重视与爱护，因而大大帮助了资金的周转与运用。
    但是，尽管如此，为什么还造成上面所述的严重积压与周转不灵的情况呢？这是因为长期的供给制情况造成了依赖思想，不重视经营管理。
    在一九五一年一月以前，钢铁工业局对于所属各厂矿资金，采取了集中掌握和调拨的制度。工厂只负责生产任务的完成，至于对供销的掌握和财务的周转，则可不负责任。这样就造成了工厂的依赖思想，使工作同志不管资金流动不流动，把积压当成是上级机关的责任，从而忽视了对经营管理的努力。
    这种思想，首先表现在对产品积压不关心，不主动组织推销，不考虑售价是否合理，只追求某些产品数量而不考虑其规格是否符合市场需要。对于订货不从销售出发，不愿接受零星小货，害怕麻烦。对债权债务的及时清理不积极。对应收货款未能主动地及时地催收。对应付货款则采取拖的办法。对于原材料的储备量则希望愈多愈好，只管供给保险，不管是否积压。总之，关于资金周转与收支情况等，从事财务供应工作的干部，是从来不计算的。
    很显然地可以看到，这种供给制的状况，造成了供给制思想；而供给制思想又促进了资金管理上的盲目与混乱。这也说明了清理资产与重新核定资金的必要性。
  流动资金是怎样核定的？
    该厂流动资金是怎样核定的呢？十分简略地提出，主要是：
    第一，通过清理，明确地知道了自有流动资金的真实情况。由于积极地处理了债权债务，重新对材料进行了估价减值，并将混杂在流动资金中的固定资产，与原材料中的冷料废料划分出来，这样就使资金比清理前实际周转着的资金减了一些。
    整理后的现有流动资金与整理前比较的增减情况列表如下：
    资    产科    目      整理后        整理后较整理    前增减百分比原材料        四七·三八    减  二·二一成品（包括在制半制品）  三○·三七    增一二·五九递延资产        一·七五    增  ○·三六总局往来      一二·○八    减  四·五五局属往来        一·七五    增  一·一七应收账款        一·九四    减  六·七四用品及在用工具  ○·五三    减  ○·○九暂付款          三·四六    减  ○·四五现金            ○·七三    减  ○·○九合  计          一○○
  负债及净值科  目        整理后        整理后较整理
        前增减百分比国家拨入自有流动资金  八六·六四    增九·六八应解政府款      ○·八二    减九·九二应解盈余        二·九八    减六·七九应付料款        ○·七六    减四·四八应付费用        二·七七    增二·一七暂收款          ○·三二    减一·三七其他            二·八六    增二·八六大修理准备      ○·八八    增○·八八预收定金        一·九七    增一·九七合  计          一○○
    上表所列的整理后流动资金总数（“即合计”）为整理前的百分之九十一。由此可见，整理前在流动资金中混杂着固定资产；对于流动资金的估价过高或过少；对于冷废料也未很好处理。所以在整理后的流动资金的各个项目比整理前就有了增减。这也说明了整理后对于流动资金的真实情况清楚了。
    第二，在初步明确地知道了自有流动资金的真实状况后，即进行编制一九五一年的财务计划。经过具体计算，根据各方面实际需要准备量，确定了各种资金周转期的平均定额日数及所需金额。这样就找出了工厂所需流动资金额的合理数字。
    需要流动资金计划的各个项目的百分比列表如下：
    （根据专家意见，该厂初次实行经济核算制，应按第四季计算。）项    目    平均定额天数      金额百分比原料及主要材料  三三          二五·八辅助材料        七七          一四·七储备零件      一二○            一·一更换装备      一二○            一·一工具及消耗品  一二○          一·七一燃料            一五      六半制品          一三            一·七在制品        一·一            二·一制成品          二八          三八·三预付款及递延费用        二五○            六·八合  计                一○○
    上表所列核定后需要流动资金的总数（即“合计”），比国家原来投入的流动资金（即整理前的流动资金情况表“负债”中“国家投入流动资金”一项）减少了百分之五十四。
  核定资金打消“资金越多越好”思想
    核定了资金以后，该厂在经营管理上遂有了很大成绩。因为大量地核减了资金，给国家缴回了原有流动资金额百分之五十四的大量财富。所以减少了浪费，加速了资金周转，使该厂能够以更少的资金获得更大的利润。这种成绩，最主要的还表现在该厂工作同志在思想上与工作上都有了很大的转变。
    首先，在思想上转变了“资金越多越好”“多总比少好”的想法，明确地认识了需要流动资金必须从实际出发，多了无用，只能形成积压，少了则不能保证周转，妨碍供应与生产。两者对国家对工厂都不利。
    石景山钢铁厂在大量核减资金后，不但不害怕资金不够用，而且相反地更感到有了把握和信心。但是必须指出，这曾经是该厂同志经过了一个艰苦的工作过程与斗争过程的结果。
    如今年四月份钢铁工业局召集资金会议时，曾提出了对各厂流动资金控制数字的意见。结果遭遇到普遍的争执，很难为各厂接受。该厂无论如何不接受，提出了种种理由，力争更多的资金。最后确定是初步的控制数字，该厂才勉强接受下来，但情绪上是很不满的。当时负责财务经营工作的同志觉得：“过去我们实际周转的资金比国家投入的增高百分之二十五以上，还周转不过来；现在局方规定的资金竟比国家投入的减少了一半，如何能周转得过来？”当上级动员该厂实行经济核算制的时候，这些同志仍然抱着“不过是大概地弄一下吧！资金少了总是要出问题的”的态度。一直到编制计划时，还是有着“资金多总比少好”的思想，为了凑够更多的资金数字，就把库存量定的过多，对销售方面估计太低。在编制计划的过程中，经过实际的精打细算，加上苏联专家在理论上和在计算方法上的帮助，这一思想才得到确实的转变。有了这一转变，解决其他问题才有了先决条件。
    其次，在工作上，由于实行独立经营，并开始了资金中的计划管理，这就基本上结束了过去心中无数的状态，使工作从被动转向主动，空前地提高了经营管理的积极性。
    通过核定资金与编制计划，许多问题明确了，大家心中有底了，知道了各个时期的收支状况与资金需要，了解了原材料的消耗情况及供销任务，并且有了财务供应计划作为考核的根据与努力的方向。因为实行独立经营，改变了供给制观念，所以他们说：“以后工作搞好搞不好都是自己的事了！”这样工作上也就立刻出现了新的面貌。
    在该厂编完计划和核定资金以后，工厂的财务和供销工作立刻表现了前所未有的积极性与主动性。首先对于资金需要和原材料储备定额要从实际出发，不能过多过少。要订好购料与销货合同，相互保证售价与规格，以适应市场，打开销路。同时对于工作上发生的问题立刻注意解决，以保证资金周转的需要，如过去财务部门与运输站订立供应采购合同，因与供应部门联系不够，因此发生了预付料款期限太长的问题，现在这个问题已解决了。又如过去对催收偿欠重视不够，资金整理后，即一面函电催索，一面主动清付。供应部门过去对产品积压从来不操心，现在仅五月份即推销了二十五万九千三百六十三万六千元的产品，并卖掉焦末一千吨，洗煤石六十吨。车间的态度也不同了，过去不愿意接受作小货，现在有几家工厂来订货，种类很多，加工也很繁杂，但车间立刻答应照作。同时各车间也不再随便提出庞大预算了，即或要增产或有额外需要，也先通知供应部门，看供应计划中有无准备。总之，一句话，都变了！这说明了经济核算制的巨大推动力量，更证明了“流动资金越多越好”的思想显然是不正确的。
