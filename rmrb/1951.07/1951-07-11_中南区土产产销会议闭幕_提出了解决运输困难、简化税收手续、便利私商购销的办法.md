　　The Central-South Region Native Products Production and Sales Conference concluded on July 5th. The conference deemed that significant progress had been made in the exchange of native products in the Central-South Region over the past six months. Eighty-five percent of the native and special products, which account for 36.6 percent of the total income of farmers in the region, have found sales outlets. Certain materials that originally relied on exports to imperialist countries, such as cinnamon, star anise, rosin, and bamboo fences, have found sales outlets domestically and in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. However, 15 percent of the region's native products are still unsold, and the region's native product exchange is still in a transitional period of "traveling the country to find connections" and has not yet been normalized.

    The conference focused on studying existing problems in native product exchange and potential future problems, and proposed solutions. High freight rates and insufficient transportation capacity are major problems in developing native product exchange in the Central-South Region. Based on the actual situation, the conference formulated decisions and instructions on adjusting automobile freight rates, automobile cargo classification, road maintenance fee collection methods, ship cargo classification and freight rates, and adjusting the region's handling labor costs. It also formulated a "Draft on Adjusting and Supplementing Railway Transportation Grades." At the same time, considering the abundance of rivers and waterways in the Central-South Region, it called on all localities to make full use of civilian ship transportation to supplement the current and post-autumn harvest transportation capacity shortage. In order to reduce the cost of unsold native products, simplify tax procedures, the conference formulated draft interim measures for temporarily reducing or exempting taxes on unsold native and special products and implementing simplified tax procedures, as well as a "Draft Decision on Improving Tax Work to Benefit Urban and Rural Material Exchange" to specifically resolve several issues in tax rates, tax types, and starting points for taxation. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient working capital for private merchants after sales channels for native products are opened, the conference formulated a "Decision on Increasing Industrial and Commercial Loans to Support Production and Economic Development." The conference believed that the Central-South Region is currently a vast area with a large proportion of small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, it is very necessary for industrial and commercial administrative departments to guide and encourage merchants to actively purchase and sell native products and supply farmers with means of production and means of livelihood, and to facilitate private merchants in deep purchasing and distant sales, and distant purchasing and deep sales. Therefore, the conference revised the past management methods for merchants that focused on passive control and formulated a "Draft Interim Measures for the Management of Merchants in the Central-South Region." The above draft measures are currently being reviewed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central-South Military and Political Committee and will soon be submitted to the Central-South Military and Political Committee or the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.

    During the conference, the delegates visited the Central-South Region Native and Special Products Exhibition and Exchange Conference and conducted transactions with each other. From June 20th to July 5th, the total value of native product transaction contracts, agreements, and spot transactions concluded inside and outside the region reached more than 270 billion yuan.

　　中南区土产产销会议闭幕
    提出了解决运输困难、简化税收手续、便利私商购销的办法
    中南区土产产销会议已于七月五日闭幕。会议认为：半年来中南区土产交流的成绩很大。占全区农民全部收入百分之三十六点六的土产、特产，已有百分之八十五找到了销路；某些原来依靠向帝国主义国家出口的物资，如桂皮、八角、松香、篱竹等，并已在国内与苏联和新民主主义国家找到了销路。但是，目前全区尚有百分之十五的土产滞销，全区土产交流仍处于“周游列国找关系”的过渡时期，尚未正常化。
    会议着重地针对目前土产交流中的一些问题和将来可能发生的问题，进行研究并提出了解决的办法。运价过高、运输力不足是目前中南区开展土产交流中的一个大问题。会议根据实际情况，拟定了关于调整汽车运价、汽车货运分等、公路养路费征收办法、轮船货物分等及运价、调整全区搬运力资等决定和指示，以及《关于铁路运输等级的调整与补列问题草案》，同时并根据中南区河道多的特点，号召各地充分利用民船运输，以补目前及秋收后运输力之不足。为降低滞销土产成本，简化税收手续，会议制订了滞销土产特产暂减免税收和实行简化税收手续等暂行办法草案及具体解决税率、税种、起征点中若干问题的《关于改进税收工作有利城乡物资交流的决定草案》。为了解决土产销路打开后私商周转资金不足的困难，会议制订了《关于增发工商贷款扶持生产发展经济的决定》。会议认为中南区目前是一个地区辽阔、小农经济比重很大的地区，因此工商行政部门引导与鼓励行商积极购销土产和供应农民以生产资料与生活资料，便利私商深购远销、远购深销，是很必要的。因此会议修订了过去偏重消极管制的行商管理办法，制订了《中南区行商管理暂行办法草案》。以上这些办法草案现正由中南军政委员会财经委员会审核中，即将呈请中南军政委员会或中央人民政府批准实施。
    会议期间，与会代表参观了中南区土特产展览交流大会并相互进行交易。自六月二十日至七月五日止，区内外订定的土产交易合同、协议和现货交易总值已达二千七百多亿元。
