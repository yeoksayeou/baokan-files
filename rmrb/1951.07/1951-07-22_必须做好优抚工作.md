Mao Zedong said: "Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people." Supporting our great revolutionary army is the political task of the people of the whole country; and giving preferential treatment and pensions to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers is a major task for the people of the whole country in supporting the revolutionary army.

The active purpose of the work of giving preferential treatment, in addition to mobilizing the masses to help the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers to solve their living difficulties, is also to educate the masses to recognize the importance of armed work, thereby consciously respecting and caring for the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, so that they have a glorious political status in society. We must create a new social morality through the work of giving preferential treatment, so that everyone feels the supreme glory of participating in the people's army.

Our work of giving preferential treatment has been successful. In the old liberated areas, during the long revolutionary war, the government and the people worked together to resettle and care for the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, organizing them to participate in production and introducing them to jobs. For the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers who lacked labor, the masses were organized on a large scale to carry out substitute farming. This excellent revolutionary tradition has been rapidly promoted to the newly liberated areas after the liberation of the whole country. Although some areas had neglected the work of giving preferential treatment after the victory of the revolutionary war, this deviation has been gradually corrected since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

The basic experiences of our work of giving preferential treatment can be summarized as follows: (1) We must attach importance to political education and mobilization, which is the prerequisite for doing a good job in giving preferential treatment. (2) There must be meticulous organizational work, mobilizing all social forces to create a mass movement in which everyone participates. (3) It must be carried out regularly and persistently. All places where work has been successful have mastered this law, and all places where work has deviated are due to insufficient attention to these three points.

The work of giving preferential treatment is inherently a complex and meticulous task. Therefore, without the full political education and ideological mobilization of the masses, it is impossible to do a good job. Many places first carry out patriotic education among the masses to raise their awareness, and use stories of various heroic battles of the soldiers at the front to educate the masses, so that everyone knows that martyrs and soldiers are the most lovable people, and they are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. Carrying out education of drinking water and thinking of the source among the masses, so that everyone knows that the creators and defenders of our happy life are countless revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, who have been and are fighting selflessly for the interests of the masses. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses for the work of giving preferential treatment will naturally rise, and they will understand that respecting and caring for the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and raising their political status, is completely right. Helping these people is no longer considered a burden, but a mutual assistance behavior within the people, and a responsibility that everyone should fulfill. The awareness of the masses, coupled with the organizational work of the leading organs, such as stipulating fair and reasonable systems, launching mutual competitions, and commending model figures and model villages in the work of giving preferential treatment, make their work of giving preferential treatment extremely successful. Conversely, some areas do not attach importance to ideological education, thinking that since the work of giving preferential treatment is something that everyone should do, as long as there are certain methods to notify everyone to do it, and simplify this work into administrative work, and simplify the substitute farming work in rural areas into a simple labor burden, ignoring or not fully paying attention to inspiring the masses' awareness and enthusiasm for substitute farming work. In this way, even if the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers can be guaranteed, the political significance of the work of giving preferential treatment is greatly reduced. Moreover, facts have proved that without ideological and political mobilization, substitute farming work is difficult to do well.

The work of giving preferential treatment must be done by everyone. First of all, all departments of the government and people's organizations should do the work of giving preferential treatment according to their own business. For example, when banks issue loans, they should give priority to the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers; cooperatives should pay attention to absorbing them as members so that they can enjoy the benefits of the cooperative, and the cooperative's public welfare fund should be used for the cause of giving preferential treatment; the health department should pay attention to treating their illnesses and give them preferential treatment; schools should give them priority in enjoying the treatment of public-funded students; department stores should give them convenience and preferential treatment in purchasing goods; post offices should give them convenience and preferential treatment in communicating with their children at the front. All agencies and state-owned enterprises should pay attention to recruiting them to participate in work. Some areas have already done this, such as the banks, health bureaus, and cooperatives in Chahar Province, which have stipulated methods for giving them preferential treatment and ordered lower-level agencies to implement them. Tianjin has made great achievements in introducing jobs to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and has stipulated measures for primary and secondary schools to give preferential treatment to the children of martyrs and soldiers in enrollment. Secondly, it is necessary to mobilize social forces and form a mass movement. Many industries and stores in Beijing have stipulated methods for giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers in purchasing goods, and incorporated them into the patriotic pact. These are all worthy of promotion.

The work of giving preferential treatment is by no means something that can be finished with a momentary burst of enthusiasm, but must be carried out regularly and persistently. The method is to have long-term plans and regular inspections, and to combine it with other relevant central tasks, especially in rural areas, it must be combined with production work. While deploying and inspecting production work, it is necessary to deploy and inspect the production work of the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the work of substitute farming for them. Only in this way can their production and living standards be guaranteed.

The notice issued by the National Association to Resist America and Aid Korea on July 4 called on all cities and villages across the country to conduct a comprehensive and practical inspection of the situation of giving preferential treatment and pensions within one week before and after the "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army this year, and to launch a mass movement of giving preferential treatment. This is very necessary. This will take our work of giving preferential treatment to a higher level. In order to widely promote the above three experiences and further improve the work of giving preferential treatment, the following points must be paid attention to in the future:

(1) Leaders at all levels should attach importance to the work of giving preferential treatment, regard it as a long-term political task, and all relevant departments and people's organizations should be mobilized to do a good job in giving preferential treatment. This work must be discussed at the people's representative meetings at all levels, and resolutions must be made, and then the government will formulate specific plans for implementation and implement them immediately. Government committees or administrative meetings at all levels should also regularly discuss, inspect, and summarize this work. All localities should pay attention to improving the political status of the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers from various aspects, and can convene representative meetings of the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers and model preferential treatment workers in a timely and prepared manner.

(2) The rural townships and administrative villages, and the urban districts and streets, should establish preferential treatment work committees as one of the government's regular work committees, absorbing active elements from the masses and representative figures of the families of martyrs and soldiers to participate, so that the work of giving preferential treatment is regularly organized and promoted by someone. This is the organizational guarantee for making the work of giving preferential treatment regular.

(3) All departments of the government, all state-owned enterprises, and people's organizations should stipulate specific methods for giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers within their own business scope, guarantee the priority of the families of martyrs and soldiers, and protect the political status of the families of martyrs and soldiers.

(4) Because 90% of the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers live in rural areas, and the main way to solve their difficulties in rural areas is to rely on organizing production and substitute farming for them. It is necessary to mobilize their own enthusiasm for production, help them engage in agricultural and sideline production, plan for the long term, and establish housework; it is necessary to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for substitute farming for them, advocate and reward model behaviors that are responsible for planting their land well; it is necessary to promote the method of fixed substitute farming, so that their land is responsible by a special person or group, to ensure that their output is not lower than the level of the masses; it is necessary to carry out various evaluations and competitions, reward and commend model families of martyrs and soldiers and model preferential treatment workers; after the spirit of mutual assistance among everyone is fully promoted, the phenomenon of unevenness in the substitute farming burden should be adjusted according to fair and reasonable principles.

(5) The number of families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers in cities is small, and some conditions in cities are better than in rural areas. Therefore, all cities must do a good job in giving preferential treatment; but in general, cities were liberated later, and the history of the work of giving preferential treatment is shorter, so more emphasis should be placed on regular propaganda and education to cultivate the habit of urban people respecting and caring for the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers. The main way to solve the difficulties of the families of martyrs and soldiers in cities is to rely on introducing jobs to them and organizing their production. The government and people from all walks of life should help them obtain employment opportunities and help them solve various difficulties in production. The preferential treatment clauses in the patriotic pacts of various units should be as specific as possible, and put forward methods for regular implementation based on what they can do. Such as how industry and commerce can enable the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers to enjoy regular preferential treatment in purchasing goods; how street residents can conduct regular visits and condolences to the nearby families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, etc.

In short, the work of giving preferential treatment is a political work, and everyone must attach importance to this work and mobilize the broad masses of the people to carry it out regularly. We should conduct political education among the masses regularly and make long-term efforts to do this work well.

### 必须做好优抚工作

　　必须做好优抚工作
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”拥护我们的伟大的革命军队，是全国人民的政治任务；而优待和抚恤革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人，正是全国人民拥护革命军队的一项主要工作。
    优抚工作的积极目的，除了发动群众帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人解决生活上的困难以外，还在于教育群众认识武装工作的重要性，从而自觉自愿地尊重和爱护革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人，使他们在社会上有光荣的政治地位。我们必须经过优抚工作，造成新的社会道德，使人人感觉到参加人民军队的无上光荣。
    我们的优抚工作是有成绩的。在各个老解放区，在长期的革命战争中，政府和人民曾经共同努力，安置和照顾革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人，组织他们参加生产，给他们介绍职业，对于缺乏劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属以及革命残废军人，则大规模地组织了群众进行代耕。这种革命的优良传统，在全国解放以后，迅速推广到新解放的地区。虽然有的地区，在革命战争胜利后产生过忽视优抚工作的现象，但自从抗美援朝运动开展以后，这种偏向已在逐渐纠正中。
    我们的优抚工作的基本经验，归纳起来，有以下三点：（一）必须重视政治的教育和动员，这是作好优抚工作的前提。（二）必须有周密的组织工作，发动一切社会力量，造成人人参加的群众运动。（三）必须经常地持久地进行。凡是工作有成绩的地方，都是掌握了这一规律的结果，凡工作发生偏差的地方，都是由于对这三点没有足够的注意。
    优抚工作本来是一种复杂细致的工作，因此，没有群众的充分的政治教育和思想发动，就不可能做好。许多地方，首先在群众中进行爱国主义的教育，提高群众的觉悟，并用前方战士各种英勇战斗的故事来教育群众，使大家知道，烈士和军人是最可爱的人，他们是中国人民最优秀的子弟。在群众中进行饮水思源的教育，使大家知道，我们的幸福生活的创造者和保卫者，正是无数的革命烈士和革命军人，他们为了群众的利益已经而且正在作忘我的战斗。这样，群众的优抚工作的积极性，自然高涨起来，明白了尊重和爱护革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人，提高他们的政治地位，是完全应该的事了。对于这些人的帮助，不再被认为是一种负担，而是人民群众内部的互助行为了，是每一个人应尽的责任了。群众的觉悟，加上领导机关的组织工作，例如规定公平合理的制度，发动相互比赛，表扬优抚工作中的模范人物和模范村庄，由于这一切，他们的优抚工作就做得极有成绩。反之，有些地区，不重视思想教育，以为优抚工作既然是大家应作的事，只要有一定的办法通知大家去作就可以了，把这一工作简单化为事务工作，把农村中的代耕工作，简单化为一种单纯的劳力负担，忽视了或不充分注意启发群众对代耕工作的自觉性与积极性，这样，纵然能保证烈属军属的生活，优抚工作的政治意义也大大地降低了，况且事实证明，没有思想政治的动员，代耕工作是很难作好的。
    优抚工作又必须大家动手，首先是政府的各部门和人民团体，依据本身的业务，都应该做优抚工作。如银行发放贷款时，应该给予烈属军属和革命残废军人以优先权；合作社应该注意吸收他们作为社员，使他们能够享受合作社的利益，合作社的公益金应该抽出一部分用于优抚事业；卫生部门应该注意给他们治病，并予以优待；学校应该给他们以享受公费生待遇的优先权；百货公司应该给他们购货的便利与优待；邮局应给他们和前方子弟通信的便利与优待。一切机关和国营企业应该注意吸收他们参加工作。现在有些地区已这样作了，如察哈尔省的银行、卫生局和合作社，都规定了优待他们的办法，通令下级机关执行。天津市为烈属、军属和革命残废军人介绍职业已有很大成绩，并规定了中小学校优待烈士和军人的子女入学的办法。其次必须发动社会力量，形成群众运动。北京市有很多行业和商店都已规定了烈、军属购货优待的办法，并把它订入爱国公约。这些都是值得推广的。
    优抚工作决不是热闹一时就可以完了的事，必须经常地持久地进行。办法是要有长期的计划和经常的检查，并且使它与其他有关的中心任务相结合，特别是在农村，要与生产工作相结合。在布置和检查生产工作的同时，就要布置和检查烈、军属和革命残废军人的生产工作及为他们代耕的工作。只有这样，才能保证他们的生产和生活的水准。
    全国抗美援朝总会七月四日发出的通知，号召全国所有的城市和乡村，在今年“八一”人民解放军建军节的前后各一星期内，对优待和抚恤工作状况作一次普遍切实的检查，开展群众性的优抚运动。这是非常必要的。这将使我们的优抚工作提高一步。为了使上面三个经验能广泛推行，进一步作好优抚工作，今后必须注意以下几点：
    （一）各级领导者要重视优抚工作，把它看作长期的政治任务，各有关部门和人民团体都应该动员起来，作好优抚工作。在各级人民代表会议上，必须讨论这一工作，作成决议，然后由政府订出实施的具体计划，并立即实行。各级政府委员会或行政会议也要经常讨论检查和总结这一工作。各地都要从多方面注意提高烈、军属和革命残废军人的政治地位，并可适时地和有准备地召开烈、军属和革命残废军人和模范优抚工作者的代表会议。
    （二）农村的乡和行政村，城市的区街，都要成立优抚工作委员会，作为政府的经常工作委员会之一，吸收群众中的积极分子和烈、军属的代表人物参加，使优抚工作，经常有人负责组织和推动。这是使优抚工作走向经常化的组织保证。
    （三）政府的各部门、各国营企业和人民团体，都要就自己的业务范围内适当规定优待烈、军属和革命残废军人的具体办法，保证烈、军属的优先权，保障烈、军属的政治地位。
    （四）因为烈、军属和革命残废军人的百分之九十居住在农村，而农村中解决他们困难的办法主要依靠组织生产和为他们代耕。要发动他们本身生产的积极性，帮助他们从事农业和副业生产，长期打算，建立家务；要发动群众为他们代耕的积极性，提倡和奖励认真负责把他们的土地种好的模范行为；要推行固定代耕的方式，使他们的土地有专人或专组负责，以保证他们的产量使不低于群众的水准；要进行各种评比和竞赛，奖励和表扬模范烈、军属和模范的优抚工作者；要在大家的互助精神充分发扬起来以后，再依公平合理的原则对代耕负担中的畸轻畸重现象予以调剂。
    （五）城市的烈、军属和革命残废军人数目较少，而城市的有些条件则较农村优越。因此，各城市必须把优抚工作做好；但一般说城市解放较迟，优抚工作的历史较短，因此更应着重经常的宣传教育，养成城市人民尊敬和爱护烈、军属和革命残废军人的习惯。城市解决烈、军属困难的办法，主要依靠为他们介绍职业和组织他们生产，政府和各界人民均应帮助他们取得就业的机会，帮助他们解决生产中的各种困难。各单位爱国公约中的优抚条款，应力求具体，各就其本身所能做到的，提出经常执行的办法。如工商业如何使烈、军属和革命残废军人可以享受经常的购货的优待；街道居民如何对就近的烈、军属和革命残废军人进行经常的访问和慰问等。
    总之，优抚工作是一种政治性的工作，必须大家重视这个工作，动员广大人民群众经常进行。应该经常向群众进行政治教育，长期努力，把这个工作作好。
