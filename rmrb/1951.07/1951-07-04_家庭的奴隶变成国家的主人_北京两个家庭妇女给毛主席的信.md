　　From Domestic Slaves to Masters of the Country
　　--A Letter to Chairman Mao from Two Housewives in Beijing
　　Dear Chairman Mao!
　　The 30th anniversary of the Party is here. We celebrate the Party's birthday, we thank the Party, and we want to tell you what's in our hearts.
　　We are housewives who have lived a miserable half-life in the old society. When we were girls in our parents' homes, our families treated us like mice, barely feeding us. Not to mention national affairs, we couldn't even manage things in the yard. Our fathers were workers, and our families were poor. There was no chance for us girls to study and go to school. When we grew up, our parents arranged our marriages. "Marry a chicken, follow a chicken; marry a dog, follow a dog; marry a stone, you have to hold onto it." At that time, we had no freedom at all! When we got to our in-laws' homes, they treated us even worse, beating and scolding us, working like cows and horses raising children, and all day we revolved around the cooking stove. As the days went by, our minds became narrower and narrower. We felt that this life was over and there was no hope. We burned incense and prayed that we wouldn't be reborn as women in the next life. Chairman Mao: For thousands of years, generations of women have lived and died in vain like this. At that time, we said, "The ghosts of those who died unjustly always follow women." Now we know that the feudal forces were the ones who wronged women. If the old society isn't overthrown, women will never have a chance to stand up!
　　Beijing was liberated, you came, the Communist Party came. We saw the sun in the darkness, our bitter days were over, and our sweet life began. We are alive again! In the two years since liberation, Beijing has been completely different from before, and we women have turned over twice. Take the two of us for example. We raised a bunch of children and were housewives for decades. Before, we were worthless, like foolish wooden figures. Now we can participate in literacy schools to learn culture and politics. The comrades from the police station, like leading children walking, teach us step by step how to work and do things for everyone. Now we are people's representatives, leading the women's work and the Resist America, Aid Korea work in the police station. We can write reports, write articles, and solve problems for the masses. Before, our minds were so narrow that even a needle couldn't pass through. Now they are wide enough for a big cart to pass through. There are many turned-over women like us in Beijing and all over the country! The foolish have become clever, the backward have moved forward, and domestic slaves have become masters of the country. It was you who gave us wisdom and courage. The Party is our reborn parent, our re-created father and mother! During the May Day parade this year, when we passed Tiananmen Square, many sisters couldn't help but cry and shout out loud, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!" One sister said, "If my hands could grow long enough to reach Tiananmen Square and shake hands with Chairman Mao, that would be great!" Our gratitude and respect for you is truly beyond words!
　　When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement started, we sent our eldest children to military cadre schools. We said: Defending the country is the most important thing. Besides, the Party takes better care of us than our own mothers, so we can rest assured even if our children go to the ends of the earth. We ourselves are busy in the streets every day doing Resist America, Aid Korea work, guarding against spies and secret agents, cleaning up, and so on. We feel that the more we do, the more energetic we become, and the busier we are, the more interesting it is. Sometimes when we hit a snag in our work and feel a little discouraged, we think of how hard you have worked for us for decades, we think of the volunteers shedding blood and sacrificing themselves on the front lines, we think of the good times in our motherland, and we think of the enthusiasm of the neighbors who trust us and elect us to work for them. Our spirits are lifted, and we are not afraid of being tired or facing difficulties. Sometimes when we look at ourselves, look around, and think about the past and the present, we feel that our motherland is really different from before, and we have really turned ourselves over. The American devils think they can bully us like they used to, they are really blind and stupid.
　　Chairman Mao: Today we are writing this letter to you. The letter is only written by two people, but our words, our intentions, are the same as those of thousands of sisters. We are actively responding to the three major calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association: promoting the patriotic pact movement, donating the "Beijing Women's Aircraft" to the volunteers, and treating the families of soldiers and martyrs as our own relatives. We will use our work and patriotic enthusiasm to commemorate the Party's birthday. Finally, we hope that you will pay attention to your diet and daily life, and take good care of your health.
　　We wish the Party and you will lead us for ten thousand years.

### 家庭的奴隶变成国家的主人——北京两个家庭妇女给毛主席的信

　　家庭的奴隶变成国家的主人
    ——北京两个家庭妇女给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席！
    党的三十周年到了，我们庆祝党的生日，我们感谢党，要把心里的话给您说说。
    我们是家庭妇女，在旧社会里窝囊了半辈子。在娘家做女孩子的时候，家里拿我们当耗子养活着，别说国家大事就连院子里的事我们也管不着。我们的父亲都是工人，家里穷，哪儿有我们女孩子念书上学的份？长大了，由父母包办给了主。“嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗，嫁块石头也得抱着走。”那时候我们一点自由都没有啊！到了婆家，更不拿我们当人，挨打受气，做牛做马养孩子，一天就抱着锅台灶台转。日子长了，心眼也圈窄了，我们觉着这一辈子完了没指望啦，就烧香拜佛祷告下辈子再别投生做女人。毛主席：几千年来世世代代多少妇女就这样白白地活了又白白地死了，那时候我们说：“屈死鬼老跟着娘们。”现在知道了屈死妇女的就是封建势力，旧社会不打垮，妇女就没个出头之日啊！
    北京解放了，您来了，共产党来了，我们在黑暗里看见了太阳，我们的苦日子完了，甜的生活开始了，我们又活啦！解放两年多北京由里到外什么都和从前不一样了，我们妇女更是翻了两个身。就拿我们两个人来说吧，养了一群孩子，做了几十年的家庭妇女，从前是一钱不值傻子似的木头人，现在也能参加补习学校学习文化、政治。派出所的同志，像领孩子走路似的，一步步教给我们做工作，为大伙办事。现在我们当了人民代表，领导着派出所里的妇女工作和抗美援朝工作，会写汇报、写稿、给群众解决问题了。从先我们的心眼窄的连针尖也穿不过，这会宽敞得能过大车。北京和全国各地像我们这样的翻身妇女多的很哩！愚蠢的变聪明了，落后的往前进了，家庭的奴隶变成国家的主人了。是您给了我们聪明智慧和勇气，党是我们的重生父母、再造爹娘啊！今年五一大游行路过天安门时，好多姐妹都含着眼泪不肯走放声的喊着：“毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！”有一个姐妹说：“我的手要是能长得长长的，伸到天安门和毛主席握手多好啊！”我们对您的感谢和敬意真是千言万语也说不尽啊！
    抗美援朝运动起来了，我们把自己的大孩子送进了军事干部学校，我们说：保家卫国最重要。再说党比亲娘照顾的还好，孩子走到天边去也放心的。我们自己成天在街道上忙着做抗美援朝、防奸细防特务、清洁卫生等等工作。我们觉着越干越有劲，越忙越有意思。有时候工作碰了钉子有些灰心，我们就想起您为我们辛苦了几十年，想起了志愿军在前线流血牺牲，想起了祖国的好光景，想起了街坊邻居信任我们推举我们出来给他们办事的热情，我们的精神就提起来了，我们就不怕累不怕困难了。有时候我们看看自己，看看周围，想想从前和现在，我们觉得祖国真是和从前不一样了，我们真是大翻了个身，美国鬼子当我们像从前那样好欺侮，真是朦了头瞎了眼睛。
    毛主席：今天我们给您写这封信，信只是两个人写的，可是我们的话，我们的心意和千千万万姐妹是一样的。我们正在积极响应抗美援朝总会的三大号召：推行爱国公约运动，捐献北京妇女号飞机给志愿军，把军属烈属当自己的亲人一样看待。我们要用工作和爱国热情来纪念党的生日。最后希望您饮食起居多多注意，好好保重您的身体。
    祝党和您领导我们万万年
              北京市人民代表，第二区六派出所妇女代表会议主任
              委员                                  周瑞明
              北京市第一区人民代表，一区十二派出所妇女代表会
              议主任委员                              赵金
