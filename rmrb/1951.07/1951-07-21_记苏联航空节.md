　　Remembering the Soviet Aviation Festival
　　Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow Li He
　　July 8th was a Sunday. In the morning, Moscow's busiest areas seemed quieter than usual. People and vehicles were gathering at the airfield of the Soviet Central Aviation Club, named after the famous aviator Chkalov, to participate in the annual Aviation Festival, which has been held every year since 1933.
　　The airfield is located in Tushino, a northwestern suburb of Moscow. Trams, trolleybuses, automobiles, and buses, all fully loaded, were coming from all directions to Tushino. On the flagpoles in front of the club, the Soviet national flag, the Air Force flag, and the Soviet Aviation Promotion Association flag were flying in the wind. Before twelve o'clock, the stands of the club and the green lawn next to the airfield in front of the club were already packed with tens of thousands of spectators. The Soviet people are enthusiasts of all new and progressive things, especially in aviation. Last summer, Moscow was often overcast or rainy on Sundays, and they were disappointed that they could not see the air show. Now, they are happily waiting for the review of a powerful force defending peace—Stalin's Eagles.
　　With the same eagerness, we arrived at the airfield around eleven o'clock. At this moment, a series of memories came to mind: Soviet pilots intercepting Japanese bombers over Wuhan and Lanzhou in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War; the Soviet Air Force annihilating 3,000 Japanese soldiers at Lake Khasan in the summer of 1938; the Soviet Air Force shooting down 164 Japanese planes at the Khalkhin Gol River from August 20th to 28th, 1939; the Soviet Air Force assisting the Soviet Army in breaking through the steel and concrete fortifications built by the Japanese Kwantung Army in Northeast China in 1945… There is also a red line tightly linking the Soviet Air Force and our Chinese people.
　　A few minutes before the performance began, we saw Marshal Stalin get out of his car and ascend the reviewing stand with the Party, government, and military leaders. Applause and cheers of "Long live Stalin" resounded in all directions.
　　Twelve o'clock. On the left side of the airfield, a burst of fire followed by a loud noise: one hundred cannons fired twenty salvos in unison. The salute and the solemn Soviet national anthem announced the start of the performance.
　　The first part was a performance by the flight athletes of the Soviet Aviation Promotion Association.
　　Twenty-five "Yak-12s" flew low past us. The leading one carried a banner with a portrait of Stalin. The two on either side carried the Soviet Air Force flag. The other two in rows of four carried the flags of the sixteen Union Republics and the Aviation Promotion Association emblem.
　　Then a flock of geese flew in from afar. These were ninety-six "Yak-18s." They formed a clear sentence in the sky: Glory to Stalin!
　　The sentence passed over our heads neatly and unchanged. The planes wrote words in the sky that were in the hearts of people all over the world, which caused unanimous applause and cheers from the people on the ground. For people living in the Stalin era, all progress and prosperity are inseparable from the name of Stalin. Russia was the first country in the world to lay the foundation for aviation science, and the first country in the world to produce talented aircraft designers and brave pilots. Scientist Mozhaisky built the world's first airplane in 1882, twenty years before the Wright brothers in the United States. Pilot Nesterov performed the world's first airplane loop in 1913. However, only after the October Revolution and the establishment of the socialist system, only under Stalin's wise leadership, could the Soviet aviation industry develop to such strength today.
　　Now three red dots appeared in the sky on the right. These were three "Yak-18s" painted red, piloted by three young amateur pilots. They were looping belly-up, and rolling sideways in the air. But the three planes always stayed close together, moving as consistently as one plane.
　　After the three left, five "Yak-18s" came. This time they were piloted by young female pilots. These planes rolled sideways, plunged headfirst, and suddenly tilted their heads up again to fly upward when they were not far from the ground, looping and tumbling.
　　We were fascinated by the courage, daring, and skillful techniques of these young male and female pilots. But even more fascinating was yet to come.
　　Twenty-five "Yak-18s" were divided into three groups and entered the airspace above the airfield. The group flying higher was looping, and the two groups flying lower were rolling sideways; later, all the planes moved consistently with the first plane, spiraling down from an altitude of one thousand meters, drawing a spring line in the sky that implied infinite power. According to Soviet newspapers, no country in the world has ever performed such a stunning group performance.
　　The performance of the flight athletes ended with two flights of three gliders each. When the planes pulled the gliders into the airspace above the airfield, they released them and left. The gliders without motors used their long wings, using the airflow, to leisurely circle in the air.
　　These performances demonstrated the superb skills of the Aviation Promotion Association members. In the past two years alone, Soviet pilots have created fifty world records. Soviet hero Chichineva, who commanded the performance of the five "Yak-18s" this time, had set an all-Union record for flight speed while piloting a "Yak-18."
　　The second part was a performance by Soviet Air Force pilots. It was commanded by Stalin's son, Air Force Lieutenant General Vasily Stalin.
　　First was the encounter flight of two Mikoyan jet planes. Jet planes are the intellectual product of the famous Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935). Tsiolkovsky was the first scientist in the world to lay the theoretical foundation for jet engines. Tsiolkovsky's ideas were valued by Soviet scientists. As early as 1930, Zander built the world's first jet engine. In 1937, Lyulka designed the world's first turbo-compressor aerojet engine. The jet planes performing now were designed by the Soviet aircraft designer Mikoyan.
　　After the two jet planes flew together into the airspace above the airfield, they separated, flipped a loop, and dived into the smoky gray cloud screen, then fell like meteors. When they were not far from the ground, they rushed towards each other like rockets, and after intersecting, they separated and dived into the clouds. In this way, they drew two large intersecting circles in front of us, these two circles reaching to the sky and close to the ground, running between heaven and earth in an instant with a speed that made them disappear from sight when their sound was heard.
　　Next was the group flight of five Mikoyan jet planes. After that was the group flight of ten Mikoyan jet planes. Jet planes fly fast, giving people a feeling of being difficult to control. But now Soviet pilots not only fly them in formation, but also perform various consistent movements in groups.
　　Then fighter planes designed by Soviet aircraft designers Mikoyan, Lavochkin, and Yakovlev flashed past us.
　　Then fifty or sixty Tupolev four-engine bombers appeared in the sky. The leading planes were escorted by four fighter planes. Afterwards came three squadrons of Ilyushin jet bombers, a total of ninety planes. Then came three squadrons of Mikoyan jet fighters, a total of one hundred and five planes. These planes formed a continuous wide training chain in the sky, and they made a deafening roar.
　　The performance continued. The several biplanes that were originally parked on the Tushino airfield suddenly nodded, rushed forward a few meters, and flew up, turned slowly in the sky, and then landed straight back in place. These were also designed by Yakovlev. This type of plane does not need a runway and can take off and land in a place smaller than an aircraft carrier deck.
　　Even more interesting was the performance of several Mil-designed helicopters. These special aircraft, originally parked on the Tushino airfield, had no wings, and their fuselages were like pufferfish, with slender propellers mounted on their backs. When the propellers rotated, the planes rose straight into the sky, hovered in the air, and then descended straight down after a moment. These planes could also move forward.
　　The performance of military aircraft ended with the flight of two seaplanes. These were designed by Beriev. The first one looked like a ship, and was said to be amphibious.
　　The third part was the parachute team performance.
　　An Ilyushin transport plane came. When it flew over the airfield, it dropped a few sesame-sized black dots. Immediately these black dots turned into colorful parachutes. These were six parachutists who had come in advance to investigate the wind direction.
　　Then came five "Yak-18s," flying in the sky at one thousand meters, dropping a few black sesame seeds. After ten seconds, the five parachutists opened their parachutes and slowly descended from the sky at the same time.
　　Finally, large teams of transport planes came one after another, scattering showers in the sky above the airfield. These raindrops opened up in the wind. From the air to the ground, it seemed as if a large colored curtain was hanging down, a large colored curtain woven from red, blue, green, and purple mushroom-like parachutes.
　　Thus ended the performance of the 1951 Soviet Air Force Day.
　　The continuous wonderful programs after one o'clock left us with deep and indelible impressions. The strength of the Soviet Air Force, the construction of Soviet aircraft, and the superb skills of the pilots are indeed well-deserved. The Soviet Union has the most advanced aviation scientists and designers in the world. The Soviet Union has the most developed aviation industry in the world. The Soviet Union has the most outstanding pilots in the world. These factors guarantee that the Soviet aviation industry can complete the tasks given by Stalin—to fly the farthest, the fastest, and the highest.
　　The Soviet Union now has many outstanding aircraft designers, such as Tupolev, Ilyushin, Yakovlev, Mikoyan, and Lavochkin, who have manufactured the most sophisticated military and civilian aircraft in the world. The aviation science traditions of Zhukovsky and Tsiolkovsky have been carried forward by them. In the Great Patriotic War, more than 200,000 Soviet aviators received awards, 2,119 were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and 63 were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union twice. There were also figures with strong willpower like Maresyev, who learned to fly even after losing his legs. The courage and wisdom of Chkalov has been inherited and popularized by them. After the October Revolution, the Soviet army only received three hundred tattered aircraft of nineteen types and five small aircraft assembly plants from the Tsarist army; and during the pre-war five-year plan years, the Soviet Union established a powerful aviation industry. In the last three years of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union was already able to produce an average of 40,000 aircraft per year. After the war, the Soviet Union made great achievements in the design of new aircraft, in the improvement of aircraft speed, in the installation of jet engines, and so on. Post-war Soviet civil aviation has seen even greater development. Since 1948, the length of Soviet air routes has exceeded that of the United States. At the end of 1949, the scale of Soviet civil aviation was seven times greater than before the war.
　　What forces have enabled the Soviet people to establish the world's most outstanding aviation industry? On the one hand, it is due to the importance attached to the cultivation and development of aviation talents and the aviation industry by the Soviet Communist Party and the government, especially Stalin. According to Soviet newspapers and periodicals, Stalin personally supervised everything from the training of aviation cadres to the design of new aircraft. On the other hand, it is also due to the importance that the people attach to aviation. In any children's club or children's palace in the Soviet Union, the most crowded room is the aircraft model room. There you can see young designers concentrating on making various aircraft models. During the difficult days of the Great Patriotic War, initiated by the collective farmers of Tambov Province, the Soviet people voluntarily donated 94.5 billion rubles to strengthen the Air Force. A collective farmer from Saratov Province, Polavoti, used his savings to buy two fighter planes and donate them to the front line. The Soviet Aviation Promotion Association plays an important role in promoting and developing the Soviet aviation industry. Its members are all over various enterprises and institutions. Young men and women who participate in this association learn various aviation skills from aviation clubs without leaving their production posts. They learn to fly planes and gliders, jump parachutes, and build aircraft models. They promote aviation knowledge to residents... In this way, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people have used their own strength to build their motherland into an aviation power.

　　记苏联航空节
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李何
    七月八日是星期天。上午，莫斯科最热闹的地区显得比往常清冷。人们和车辆都汇集到以著名飞行家契卡洛夫命名的苏联中央航空俱乐部的飞机场去了，参加一九三三年以来一年一度的航空节去了。
    飞机场在莫斯科西北郊的土希诺。电车、无轨电车、汽车、公共汽车，从四面八方满载着人们到土希诺去。俱乐部前的旗杆上，苏联国旗、空军军旗、苏联航空促进协会会旗迎风飘扬着。十二点钟前，俱乐部的看台上，俱乐部前面一片绿茵的飞机场旁边，已经挤满了成千累万的观众。苏联人是一切新鲜的、进步的事物的爱好者，对于航空事业尤其是如此，去年夏天，莫斯科每逢星期天不是天阴就是下雨，他们因为看不到航空表演而怅惘。现在，他们高兴地等待保卫和平的一支强大力量——斯大林之鹰的检阅。
    我们怀着同样热切的心情，在十一点钟左右赶到飞机场。这时，一连串记忆冒上心来：抗战初期苏联飞行员在武汉和兰州上空阻击日寇轰炸机；一九三八年夏天苏联空军在哈桑湖消灭三千日军；一九三九年八月二十日至二十八日苏联空军在哈拉欣河击落日机一百六十四架；一九四五年苏联空军协助苏军冲破日本关东军在东北建筑的钢骨水泥工事……。苏联空军和我们中国人民之间也有一条结得紧紧的红线呵。
    表演开始前几分钟，我们看到斯大林大元帅下了小汽车，和党政军领袖们登上了检阅台。鼓掌和“斯大林万岁”的欢呼声响遍了四方。
    十二点钟。在飞机场左边，一阵火光紧接着一阵巨响：一百门炮齐发二十响。礼炮和庄严的苏联国歌，宣布了表演的开始。
    第一部分是苏联航空促进协会的飞行运动员的表演。
    二十五架“雅克—十二”在我们面前低飞过去了。领头的一架载着斯大林画像的旗帜。两旁两架载着苏联空军军旗。另外两架载着“向共产主义前进”的红旗。随后四架一排地载着十六个加盟共和国国徽和航空促进协会会徽的旗帜。
    接着从远方飞来了一片雁群。这是九十六架“雅克—十八”。它们在天空组成了鲜明的字句：光荣归于斯大林！
    字句整齐不变地掠过我们的头顶。飞机在空中写出了普天之下人们心坎的话，因而引起了地上人们不约而同的鼓掌和欢呼。活在斯大林时代的人们，所有的进步和繁荣，都是和斯大林的名字分不开的。俄罗斯是世界上首先奠定航空科学基础的国家，是世界上首先产生天才的飞机设计家和勇敢的飞行员的国家。科学家摩查伊斯基在一八八二年，即在美国莱特兄弟前二十年，就制造了世界上第一架飞机。飞行员纳斯特罗夫在一九一三年就表演了世界上第一次的飞机翻跟斗的技术。但是，只有在十月革命和社会主义制度建立后，只有在斯大林的英明领导下，苏联航空事业才能发展到今天这样的强大。
    现在从右边天空出现了三个红点。这是三架漆着红色的“雅克—十八”。由三个年青的业余飞行员驾驶着。它们肚子朝天地翻着跟斗，又横着机身在空中打滚。但是三架飞机始终紧靠在一起，如同一架飞机一致地动作。
    三架走后，来了五架“雅克—十八”。这一回是由女青年飞行员驾驶。这些飞机横着机身打滚，把头朝地直栽，到离地不远时突然又翘起头来向上飞，鹞子大翻身地翻着跟斗。
    我们被这些男女青年飞行员的勇敢大胆和娴熟技术迷住了。然而更迷人的还在后面。
    二十五架“雅克—十八”分成三群进入飞机场上空。飞得较高的一群翻着跟斗，飞得较低的两群横着机身打滚；后来，所有飞机都随着第一架一致动作，从一千公尺高空螺旋式曲折下降，在天空画出一道含蓄着无限威力的弹簧线。据苏联报纸说，世界上还没有一个国家作过这样惊人的集体表演。
    飞行运动员的表演，以两次各三架滑翔机的飞行而结束。当飞机把滑翔机拉进飞机场上空时，就放开它们走了。没有马达的滑翔机，用它们长长的翅膀，借着气流，安闲地在空中盘旋。
    这几种表演表明了航空促进协会会员技术的高超。仅仅在最近两年中，苏联飞行员就创造了五十种世界纪录。这次指挥五架“雅克—十八”表演的苏联英雄契齐涅娃，就曾驾驶“雅克—十八”创造了飞行速度的全苏纪录。
    第二部分是苏联空军飞行员的表演。这是由斯大林的儿子华西里·斯大林空军中将指挥的。
    首先是两架米高扬喷射飞机的遭遇飞行。喷射飞机是俄罗斯著名科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基（一八五七——一九三五）的思想产物。齐奥尔科夫斯基是世界上首先奠定喷射发动机的理论基础的科学家。齐奥尔科夫斯基的思想受到苏联科学家的重视。远在一九三零年参德尔就制造了世界上第一个喷射发动机。一九三七年刘尔卡设计了世界上第一个透平压缩航空喷射发动机。现在表演的喷射飞机，就是苏联飞机设计家米高扬设计的。
    两架喷射飞机一起飞到飞机场上空后，分开来，翻一个跟斗就钻进淡墨色云屏风里，然后像流星一样落下来，离地不远的时候，像火箭一般相向冲去，在交叉地遭遇之后，又分开来钻入云端。这样，它们在我们面前画着一弧相交的两个大圆形，这两个圆形上顶天，下近地，用听到它们的声音时已经看不见它们的踪迹的速度，一刹那间运行于天地之间。
    接着是五架米高扬喷射飞机的群飞。再后是十架米高扬喷射飞机的群飞。喷射飞机飞得快，给人以难以操纵的感觉。但是现在苏联飞行员不但驾驶着它们结队飞行，而且驾驶着它们成群地表演种种一致动作。
    然后风驰电闪地在我们面前飞过了一架又一架驱逐机，这是米高扬、拉沃茨金、雅科夫列夫这些苏联著名飞机设计家设计的。
    接着天空出现了五六十架杜波列夫四引擎轰炸机。领队的飞机有四架驱逐机护送。随后来了三队伊尔友新喷射轰炸机，一共九十架。随后又是三队米高扬喷射驱逐机，一共一百零五架。这些飞机，在天空构成一条川流不息的宽阔长练，它们发出了山崩地裂似的巨响。
    表演继续着。原来停在土希诺飞机场上的几架双翼飞机，忽然点点头，抢前几公尺，就飞起来了，在天空徐徐一转，又直落原位。这也是雅科夫列夫设计的。这种飞机不用跑道，可以在比航空母舰甲板更小的地方升落。
    更有趣的是几架米尔设计的直升飞机的表演。这些原来停在土希诺飞机场上的特种飞机，没有翅膀，机身像河豚一样，背上装着瘦长的螺旋桨。螺旋桨转动起来，飞机就直升天空，在空中停留不动，片刻又直降下来。这种飞机也能向前移动。
    军用飞机的表演，以两架海上飞机的飞行而结束。这是别里耶夫设计的。头一架像一艘船，据说是水陆两栖的。
    第三部分是降落伞队表演。
    来了一架伊尔友新运输机。当它飞到飞机场上空时，丢下了几个芝麻大的黑点。马上这些黑点变成五颜六色的降落伞。这是六个降落伞员，预先来考察风向的。
    接着来了五架“雅克—十八”，飞在一千公尺天空，丢下了几个黑芝麻。过了十秒钟，五个降落伞员才张开伞来，同时从天上徐徐降落。
    最后陆续来了大队运输机，先后在飞机场上空撒下一阵阵雨点。这些雨点迎风张开。从空中到地上好像挂下了一面大彩幕，由红蓝绿紫彩色蘑菇似的降落伞织成的大彩幕。
    这样，结束了一九五一年苏联空军节的表演。
    一点多钟不断的精彩节目留给我们深刻不灭的印象。苏联空军的强大，苏联飞机的构造和飞行员技术的高超，果然名不虚传。苏联有世界上最先进的航空科学家和设计家。苏联有世界上最发达的航空工业。苏联有世界上最优秀的飞行员。这些因素保证着苏联航空事业能够完成斯大林所给的任务——要飞得最远、最快、最高。
    苏联现在有许多杰出的飞机设计家，如像杜波列夫、伊尔友新、雅科夫列夫、米高扬、拉沃茨金，他们制造了世界上最精良的军用机和民用机。朱可夫斯基和齐奥尔科夫斯基的航空科学传统被他们发扬光大了。苏联在卫国战争中有二十多万位航空员得奖，二千一百十九位得到苏联英雄称号，六十三位得到两次苏联英雄称号，出过像马列西也夫这样断了腿后还学会飞行的意志坚强的人物。契卡洛夫的勇敢和智慧被他们承继和普及起来了。十月革命后，苏军从沙皇军队那里只接收了三百架十九种类型的破烂飞机和五个装配飞机的小工厂；而在战前五年计划年份中，苏联建立起了强大的航空工业，在卫国战争的最后三年苏联已经能够每年平均出产四万架飞机。战后苏联在设计新式飞机上，在飞机速度的改进，喷射发动机的装配等等上，取得了巨大的成就。战后苏联民用航空有更大的发展。从一九四八年起，苏联航空线的长度已经超过了美国。一九四九年底苏联民用航空规模比战前增加了七倍。
    什么力量使苏联人建立起世界上最出色的航空事业呢？一方面是由于苏联共产党和政府，特别是斯大林，对于培养和发展航空人材和航空工业的重视。据苏联报刊说，从航空干部的培养到新式飞机的设计，斯大林都亲自加以指导。另一方面也由于人民对于航空的重视。在苏联任何儿童俱乐部或儿童宫里，最拥挤的是飞机模型室。在那里你可以看到少年设计家在聚精会神地制造各种飞机模型。在卫国战争的困难日子里，由坦波夫省集体农民发起，苏联人民为加强空军自愿捐献了九百四十五亿卢布，萨拉托夫省有一个集体农民波拉沃提，把自己的积蓄买了两架战斗机，献给前线。在宣传和促进苏联航空事业的发展上，苏联航空促进协会起着重要的作用。它的会员遍及各个企业和机关。参加这个会的男女青年们不脱离生产地从航空俱乐部学到各种航空技能。他们学会驾驶飞机和滑翔机，跳降落伞，造飞机模型。他们向居民宣传着航空知识……就这样，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，用自己的力量，把自己的祖国造成为航空强国。
