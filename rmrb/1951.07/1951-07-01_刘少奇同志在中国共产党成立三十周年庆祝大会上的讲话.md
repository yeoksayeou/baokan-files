Comrades!

　　Today is the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Communist Party of China. Thirty years ago, when our Party was first founded, China only had a few groups studying and publicizing Marxism, and the number of people was very small. However, today, our Party has developed into a great party leading the great People's Republic of China. Our Party now has 5.8 million members. Among them, about 2.7 million work in the armed forces, state organs, factories, mines, and schools, and more than 3 million are distributed in rural areas. There are more than 600,000 female party members and more than 1.2 million young party members under the age of 25. These party members have established about 250,000 primary party organizations - branches. Many of our party members are responsible for leading work in all aspects of the country, and at the same time, more party members are engaged in various physical or mental labor and work with the working people and soldiers in various factories, mines, rural areas, organs and schools, and company units of the army. They are closely connected with the broad masses of the people. Most of them have a high level of awareness, so they have a spirit of selfless devotion. Whether on the battlefield, in labor, or in various jobs, they are selfless, brave and calm, and are the most capable of taking care of the overall situation and abiding by the discipline of the people. Therefore, they can gain the trust of the broad masses of the people, and the people regard them as the closest and most reliable friends. This means that our Party has become the recognized leader of the whole country, and at the same time, it is a public servant of the people who wholeheartedly serves the people, and a service member of the people.

　　This is a simple picture of our Party today.

　　Our Party is the greatest, most glorious, and most correct party in Chinese history.

　　Our Party started from several individual Marxist groups, and in the past thirty years, it has gone through an infinitely glorious path of historical development.

　　However, in the great revolutionary struggles of the past thirty years, our Party has also gone through unimaginable arduous, complex, and tortuous struggle paths.

　　For thirty years, the enemies facing the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have been almost all the imperialist countries in the world and the powerful Chinese feudal forces and the forces of the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie. These enemies are very fierce. They do not give the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people any freedom of activity. They treat communists with barbaric massacres and punishments, attempting to kill off the communists. In the face of such enemies, if the Chinese communists did not take up guns and engage in unyielding armed struggle with the enemies, they could not carry out revolutionary activities. Precisely because of this, the Chinese communists and the revolutionary Chinese people took up guns long ago to fight against the enemies, and in more than twenty years, they carried out four great revolutionary wars, and finally overthrew the rule of these enemies on the land of China, and achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution. This is a victory of great significance in Chinese history and also in world history. The achievement of this victory should first of all be attributed to the countless martyrs, both party and non-party, famous and unknown, who bravely sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle.

　　Comrades! In the face of powerful and fierce enemies, without the successive and heroic sacrifices of countless martyrs, it would be impossible to defeat the enemies and achieve the victory of the revolution. The selfless and heroic spirit of sacrifice of our martyrs on the enemy's execution ground, on the battlefield, and in various struggles represents the finest tradition of our nation and our Party, and is the most sublime model for all our party members and the people of the whole country. For the liberation of the people, for the completion of the tasks given to them by the Party, they made no reservations, no concerns, shed their last drop of blood, and exhausted their last ounce of energy. Their spirit is forever worthy of our study and commemoration. The spirit of the martyrs is immortal!

　　In order to commemorate the party and non-party martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the revolutionary struggle over the past thirty years, I propose that everyone stand up and observe three minutes of silence to express our condolences!

　　When celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, we must also not forget those comrades who have suffered inhuman torture and long-term suffering in the enemy's courts and prisons, thus losing their health, and those comrades who have been injured in battles and struggles, thus making their limbs disabled. Here, we would like to express our condolences to them.

　　The reason why our Party and the Chinese revolution were able to win is inseparable from the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party's leader. Marxism-Leninism is the only correct ideological weapon to guide our Party and the Chinese people to unite themselves and defeat the enemy. Comrade Mao Zedong is the most outstanding expert in mastering Marxism-Leninism and applying it appropriately to solve various problems in the Chinese revolution. Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's thirty years of brilliant efforts, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism has been closely integrated with the concrete revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people step by step. Therefore, on the ideological and organizational level, our Party has been built up according to the example of the Soviet Bolshevik Party, and our Party has been connected with the broader masses of the people step by step. Comrade Mao Zedong also put forward correct guidelines, tasks, and policies for our Party and the people in various revolutionary periods, and overcame the erroneous guidelines, tasks, and policies put forward by various opportunists within the Party and various factions outside the Party under extremely complex and difficult circumstances. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army, which is the main tool of the Chinese people's revolution, has been formed and strengthened, and the united front of the Chinese people's revolution has been formed, consolidated, and expanded. Because our Party and the Chinese people have had such correct leadership from Comrade Mao Zedong, they have been able to defeat powerful enemies step by step in a serious, long-term, and complex struggle, and have achieved such a victory today. Comrade Mao Zedong's correct leadership is of decisive significance to the victory of our Party and the Chinese people in the revolutionary struggle. It can be said that without Comrade Mao Zedong's correct leadership in various periods, it would have been impossible for our Party and the Chinese people to achieve such a victory today. With Comrade Mao Zedong's correct leadership, our Party and the Chinese people are guaranteed to continue to achieve more and greater victories in future revolutionary struggles. Therefore, when celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, we cannot but thank our leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. Pay tribute to our leader, Comrade Mao Zedong!

　　The reason why our Party and the Chinese revolution were able to win is inseparable from the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the past twenty-four years. The Chinese People's Liberation Army was founded and educated by Comrade Mao Zedong himself, and fought for twenty-four years under the personal command of Comrade Mao Zedong. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the main tool for our Party and the Chinese people to defeat imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and establish the People's Republic of China. Without the heroic combat and selfless work of all commanders, fighters, and other personnel of the People's Liberation Army in the past twenty-four years, it would have been impossible for our Party and the Chinese people to achieve such a victory today. Similarly, without the heroic combat of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean front and the Korean People's Army together, it would have been impossible to resist and defeat the aggression of the American and British imperialists against China and Korea. Therefore, when celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, we cannot but thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, and the Korean People's Army. Pay tribute to all commanders, fighters, logistics workers, and other personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, and the Korean People's Army!

　　The reason why our Party and the Chinese revolution were able to win is inseparable from the long-term hard work and heroic struggle of the vast number of cadres and party members of our Party, and is inseparable from the support and trust of the broad working class and peasant masses and other revolutionary people for our Party and the People's Liberation Army, as well as their heroic struggle in the revolutionary struggle. It is inseparable from the cooperation and assistance given to our Party by the various democratic parties and non-party patriotic democrats in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and in the various construction works of the new China. Obviously, without all of this, it would have been impossible for our Party and the Chinese people to achieve such a victory today. It would also be impossible to build a new China after the victory. Therefore, when celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, we would like to thank the vast number of cadres and party members who work hard and fight heroically! We would like to thank the working class and peasant masses and other revolutionary people who support and trust our Party and the People's Liberation Army in the revolutionary struggle and in labor production, and who carry out heroic struggle and enthusiastic labor! We would like to thank the democratic parties and democrats who give our Party their sincere cooperation and assistance in the revolutionary struggle and construction work!

　　In tracing the ultimate reason why our Party and the Chinese revolution were able to win, we cannot forget the influence that the Russian October Revolution gave to China, the theory of proletarian socialist revolution created and developed by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the influence of Marxism-Leninism on the Chinese revolution, and the sympathy and assistance of the proletariat and working people of the Soviet Union and other countries in the world for the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Before the October Revolution, the Chinese people not only did know Lenin and Stalin, but also did not know Marx and Engels. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements all over the world, including China, to use the proletarian worldview as a tool to observe the destiny of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Take the road of the Russians - this is the conclusion." He also said: "The Chinese people have found Marxism-Leninism, a theory that is universally applicable, and the face of China has changed." Obviously, the Marxist-Leninist theory sent to China by the Russian October Revolution is the most fundamental weapon for our Party and the Chinese people to defeat the enemy and win the victory of the revolution. Without the Russian October Revolution, without the creation and continuous development of Marxism-Leninism by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, without the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union and the proletariat and working people of various countries in the world for the Chinese revolution, it would have been impossible for our Party and the Chinese people to achieve such a victory today. Therefore, when celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, we cannot but thank the heroes of the October Revolution, cannot but thank Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and cannot but thank the Soviet Union and the proletariat and working people of various countries in the world who sympathize with and assist the Chinese revolution. Pay tribute to the heroes of the October Revolution! Pay tribute to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin! Pay tribute to the Soviet Union and the proletariat and working people of various countries in the world!

　　As mentioned above, the reason why our Party and the Chinese revolution were able to win has many profound and complex roots in the development of world history and Chinese history. Some comrades do not understand or do not fully understand these profound and complex reasons why our Party and the Chinese revolution were able to win. They simply believe that this victory is only because they have won the world. Therefore, they show a sense of pride and other erroneous views. These comrades should be educated with the history of the world revolution and the Chinese revolution in order to broaden their horizons and correct their arrogant and conceited views and other erroneous views.

　　Comrades! Our Party and the Chinese people have gone through thirty years of arduous and complex struggles and have achieved a victory of great historical significance. However, the victory we have already achieved, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles." The Chinese revolution is far from over. The view that the Chinese revolution is over is a completely wrong view of a non-proletarian nature. Even the revolutionary war we are waging has not yet ended. Taiwan in China has not yet been liberated. The Chinese People's Volunteers are still heroically resisting the invading troops of American and British imperialism on the Korean front. The feudal forces in China have not yet been completely eliminated. The arduous and great tasks of national economic construction and cultural construction are placed before us, waiting for us to complete them. Imperialism and its running dogs are planning every day to sabotage our cause and restore their rule in China. Therefore, we must carry out a long-term, complex, and arduous struggle in order to defend and consolidate the victory we have already gained, and to complete the construction of new democracy, so that China can move from an agricultural country to an industrial country. After that, we must go to a socialist and communist society, finally eliminate classes, and realize the Great Harmony. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road ahead after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong requires us: "Be sure to make comrades continue to maintain the style of being modest, prudent, not arrogant, and not impatient, and be sure to make comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." Only by following these instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and learning more Marxist-Leninist theory and Comrade Mao Zedong's thought and style can we unite a wider range of people to complete the greater, more arduous revolutionary tasks ahead. This is what all our party members should strive for when celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party. We believe that the Party, which has been tempered by thirty years of great revolutionary struggle, will certainly be able to complete our more arduous, greater, and more glorious tasks ahead under the continued leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, and through the continued efforts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country.

　　Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

　　Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the creator and leader of our Party, and the organizer and leader of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution!

　　Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China and the world!

　　Long live the great unity of the Chinese people, the revolutionary united front of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and democrats in China!

### 刘少奇同志在中国共产党成立三十周年庆祝大会上的讲话

　　刘少奇同志在中国共产党成立三十周年庆祝大会上的讲话同志们！
    今天是我们中国共产党成立的三十周年纪念日。在三十年前我们党刚成立的时候，中国还只有一些研究和宣传马克思主义的小组，人数是很少的。但是，在今天，我们党已经发展成为领导伟大的中华人民共和国的大党了。我们党现在有五百八十万党员。其中约有二百七十多万人是在武装部队、国家机关及工厂、矿山和学校中工作，三百多万人分布在农村中。有女党员六十多万人，二十五岁以下的青年党员一百二十多万人。这些党员建立了约有二十五万个党的基层组织——支部。我们党有很多党员担负着国家的各方面的领导工作，同时，又有更多的党员在各种工厂中、矿山中、农村中、机关和学校中、部队的连队中，和劳动人民与战士们在一起从事各种体力的或脑力的劳动和工作。他们都是密切地联系着广大的人民群众。他们中间的大多数都有高度的觉悟水平，因而他们具有大公无私的精神，不论在战场上，在劳动中，在各种工作中，他们都是奋不顾身的，聪明而沉着的，最能照顾大局与遵守人民的纪律的，所以他们能够取得广大人民群众的信任，人民群众把他们当作最亲近和最可靠的朋友。这就是说，我们的党已经成为全国人民公认的领袖，同时，又是全心全意地为人民服务的人民的公仆，人民的勤务员。
    这就是今天我们党的简单的情况。
    我们的党是中国历史上最伟大、最光荣、最正确的党。
    我们的党从若干个别的马克思主义的小组开始，三十年来，是经过了无限光辉的历史发展道路的。
    但是，我们党在三十年来的伟大的革命斗争中，也经过了难以想像的艰苦的、复杂的和曲折的斗争道路。
    三十年来，摆在中国共产党和中国人民面前的敌人，是世界上差不多所有的帝国主义国家和强大的中国封建势力与官僚买办大资产阶级的势力。这些敌人是十分凶恶的。他们不给中国共产党和中国人民以任何活动的自由。他们用野蛮的屠杀和刑罚来对待共产党人，企图杀绝共产党人。在这样的敌人面前，中国共产党人如果不拿起枪来，和敌人进行坚持不屈的武装斗争，就不能进行革命的活动。正因为如此，中国共产党人和革命的中国人民早就拿起枪来向敌人作斗争了，并且在二十多年中进行了四次伟大的革命战争，才在中国的土地上最后地推翻了这些敌人的统治，取得了中国革命的胜利。这是在中国历史，同样在世界历史上都具有伟大意义的胜利。这个胜利的取得，应该首先归功于那些在革命斗争中英勇牺牲的、党与非党的、有名的和无名的无数烈士们。
    同志们！在强大而凶恶的敌人面前，没有无数烈士们前仆后继、英勇牺牲的奋斗，要战胜敌人，取得革命的胜利，乃是不可能的。我们的烈士们在敌人的刑场上、在战场上、在各种斗争中那种忘我的、英勇的牺牲精神，乃是代表我们民族和我们党的最优良的传统，乃是我们全体党员和全国人民最崇高的模范。他们为了人民的解放，为了完成党所给予他们的任务，他们没有任何保留，任何顾虑，流了他们最后一滴血，用完了他们最后一分精力，他们的精神是永远值得我们学习和纪念的。烈士们的精神永垂不朽！
    为了纪念三十年来在革命斗争中英勇牺牲的党与非党的烈士们，我提议大家起立静默三分钟志哀！
    在庆祝我们党的成立三十周年纪念时，我们同样不能忘记的，就是那些曾经在敌人的法庭上和牢狱中受过非刑拷打和长期磨难因而丧失了他们的健康以及在战场上和斗争中受伤因而使他们的肢体残废了的同志们。我们在此谨向他们致慰问之意。
    我们党和中国革命之所以能够胜利，和我们党的领袖毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的正确领导是分不开的。马克思列宁主义是指导我们党和中国人民团结自己、战胜敌人的唯一正确的思想武器，毛泽东同志是精通马克思列宁主义并且是把它恰当地运用起来解决中国革命中各种问题的最杰出的能手。由于毛泽东同志三十年来的天才的努力，使马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国人民的具体革命斗争一步一步地密切地结合了起来，因而就在思想上和组织上按照苏联布尔什维克党的榜样把我们党建设了起来，并使我们党一步一步地联系了更加广大的人民群众。毛泽东同志又在各个革命时期为我们党和人民提出了正确的革命斗争的方针、任务和政策，并在极端复杂和困难的情形下克服了党内各种机会主义者和党外各种派别所提出的错误的方针、任务和政策，因而组成了并且壮大了作为中国人民革命主要工具的人民解放军，又组成了并且巩固和扩大了中国人民革命的统一战线。我们党和中国人民因为有了毛泽东同志的这样正确的领导，才能在严重的长期而复杂的斗争中一步一步地战胜了强大的敌人，取得了今天这样的胜利。毛泽东同志的正确领导，对于我们党和中国人民在革命斗争中的胜利，是具有决定意义的。可以说，如果没有毛泽东同志在各个时期的正确的领导，我们党和中国人民要取得今天这样的胜利，乃是不可能的。有了毛泽东同志的正确领导，我们党和中国人民在今后的革命斗争中要继续取得更多更大的胜利，也就有了保障。因此，在庆祝我们党的成立三十周年纪念时，我们不能不感谢我们的领袖毛泽东同志。向我们的领袖毛泽东同志致敬！
    我们党和中国革命之所以能够胜利，和中国人民解放军在二十四年来的英勇斗争是分不开的。中国人民解放军是毛泽东同志所亲手创立和教育出来的，并在毛泽东同志的亲自指挥之下战斗了二十四年。中国人民解放军是我们党和中国人民借以战胜帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义、建立中华人民共和国的主要工具，没有人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员及其他工作人员在二十四年来的英勇战斗和忘我的工作，我们党和中国人民要取得今天这样的胜利，乃是不可能的。同样，没有中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民军一道英勇战斗，要抵抗和击退美英帝国主义对于中国和朝鲜的侵略，也是不可能的。因此，在庆祝我们党的成立三十周年纪念时，我们不能不感谢中国人民解放军、在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军以及朝鲜人民军。向中国人民解放军、在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军以及朝鲜人民军的全体指挥员、战斗员、后勤工作及其他工作人员致敬！
    我们党和中国革命之所以能够胜利，和我们党的广大干部与党员在长时期中的艰苦工作和英勇斗争是分不开的，和广大的工农劳动人民及其他阶层的革命的人民对于我们党和人民解放军的支持与信任以及他们在革命斗争中的英勇奋斗是分不开的，和中国各民主党派以及无党无派的民主爱国人士在反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的斗争中以及在新中国的各种建设工作中给予我们党的合作和赞助是分不开的。很显然，没有这一切，我们党和中国人民要取得今天这样的胜利，乃是不可能的。胜利了，要建设新中国，也是不可能的。因此，在庆祝我们党的成立三十周年纪念时，我们要向那些埋头工作和英勇奋斗的广大的干部和党员致谢！要向那些在革命斗争中以及在劳动生产中支持与信任我们党和人民解放军并进行英勇斗争和热忱劳动的工农劳动人民以及其他阶层的革命的人民致谢！要向那些在革命斗争和建设工作中给予我们党以竭诚合作和赞助的民主党派与民主人士致谢！
    追究我们党和中国革命之所以能够胜利的最后的原因，使我们更加不能忘记的，就是俄国十月革命所给予中国的影响，就是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林所创立和发展起来的关于无产阶级社会主义革命的理论和马克思列宁主义对于中国革命的影响，就是苏联以及世界各国的无产阶级和劳动人民对于中国革命的同情和援助。毛泽东同志说：“在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁、斯大林，也不知道马克思、恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”又说：“中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的理论，中国的面目就起了变化了。”显然，由俄国十月革命送给中国来的马克思列宁主义理论，乃是我们党和中国人民用以战胜敌人、取得革命胜利的最根本的武器。没有俄国的十月革命，没有马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林对于马克思列宁主义的创造和不断的发展，没有苏联以及世界各国无产阶级和劳动人民对于中国革命的同情和援助，我们党和中国人民要取得今天这样的胜利，乃是不可能的。因此，在庆祝我们党的成立三十周年纪念时，我们不能不感谢十月革命的英雄们，不能不感谢马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林，不能不感谢苏联以及那些同情和援助中国革命的世界各国的无产阶级和劳动人民。向十月革命的英雄们致敬！向马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林致敬！向苏联以及世界各国的无产阶级和劳动人民致敬！
    如上所述，我们党和中国革命之所以能够胜利，乃是具有世界历史和中国历史的发展中许多深刻的、复杂的根源的。有些同志不了解或不完全了解我们党和中国革命所以能够胜利的这些深刻的复杂的原因，他们简单地认为这种胜利只是由于他们打下了天下，因而，他们就表现了居功骄傲以及其他错误的观点。应该用世界革命和中国革命的历史教育这些同志，以便扩大他们的眼界，纠正他们骄傲自大的观点以及其他错误的观点。
    同志们！我们党和中国人民经过了三十年来艰苦卓绝和复杂曲折的斗争，是取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利。但是，我们已经取得的胜利，正如毛泽东同志所说：“只是万里长征走完了第一步”。中国革命还远没有完结。那些认为中国革命业已完结的观点，是一种非无产阶级的完全错误的观点。就是我们所进行的革命战争，现在也还没有完结，中国的台湾还没有解放，中国人民志愿军还在朝鲜前线英勇地抵抗着美英帝国主义的侵略军，中国的封建势力也还没有最后地肃清。国家经济建设和文化建设的艰苦而伟大的任务正摆在我们的面前，待我们去完成，帝国主义及其走狗每天都在计划着要破坏我们的事业，使他们在中国复辟。因此，我们还要进行长期、复杂而艰苦的斗争，才能保卫和巩固我们已得的胜利，并完成新民主主义的建设事业，使中国由农业国进到工业国。在此以后，还要进到社会主义与共产主义社会去，最后地消灭阶级和实现大同。因此，毛泽东同志说：“中国革命是伟大的，但是革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”因此，毛泽东同志要求我们：“务必使同志们继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”我们只有遵从毛泽东同志的这些指示，并学习更多的马克思列宁主义的理论和毛泽东同志的思想与作风，我们才能团结更广大的人民群众，去完成今后更伟大、更艰苦的革命任务。这就是我们全体党员在庆祝我们党的成立三十周年纪念时所应该努力的地方。我们相信：经过了三十年的伟大革命斗争锻炼的党，继续在毛泽东同志和党中央的领导之下，经过全党和全国人民的继续努力，是一定能够完成我们前面更艰苦、更伟大、更光荣的任务的。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    我们党的创造者和领导者，中国人民革命胜利的组织者和领导者毛泽东同志万岁！
    马克思列宁主义在中国和世界的胜利万岁！
    中国人民革命的大团结，中国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派和民主人士的革命统一战线万岁！
