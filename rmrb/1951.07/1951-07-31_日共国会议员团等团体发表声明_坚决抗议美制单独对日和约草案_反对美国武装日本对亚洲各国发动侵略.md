　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Japan's democratic public is firmly protesting the American-made separate peace treaty draft, and opposing the United States' attempt to convene a so-called "peace conference" in San Francisco to sign such a separate peace treaty.

　　On July 19th, the Japanese Communist Party Parliamentary Group issued a statement, stating in brief: If the American-made draft peace treaty with Japan is realized, Japan will become a colony of the United States, and the Japanese people will become slaves of the imperialists. Because according to the "US-Japan Security Agreement" signed simultaneously with the separate peace treaty, US troops will remain in Japan and can establish military bases and barracks in Japan without restriction.

　　The military purpose of the American-made draft peace treaty with Japan is to rearm Japan without restriction, restore Japanese militarism, and turn the Japanese people into imperialist mercenaries to carry out aggressive wars against the people of Asia.

　　The economic purpose of this American-made draft peace treaty is to turn Japan into an auxiliary factory for the American war economy and impose slave labor conditions on Japanese workers.

　　The political purpose of this draft peace treaty is to suppress the democratic movement of the Japanese people and restore the fascist system.

　　The statement continued: This draft peace treaty is a challenge to the people of the world, enslaving the Japanese nation, and launching aggression against Asian countries. Moreover, it regards the Soviet Union, China, and Korea as hostile countries. This is not a peace treaty but a war treaty. It is illegal and invalid. The peace-loving people of Asia and the world can never accept it.

　　The Communist Party Parliamentary Group requested in the concluding remarks of the statement: All countries that fought against Japan should participate in the preparation and signing of the peace treaty with Japan. Such a treaty should be based on the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement. Moreover, the peace conference convened for this purpose should have the participation of all countries that fought against Japan.

　　The statement issued by the Japan Peace Protection Committee on the American draft peace treaty with Japan pointed out: The United States' plan to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan in September is being intensified. As everyone knows, the purpose of this plan is to prevent the Soviet Union and China from participating in the signing of the peace treaty, to rearm Japan, and to force Japan to fight against these two countries. In addition, the American draft is to turn Japan into a colony and enslave the Japanese people. We will never allow the conclusion of such a separate peace treaty. We firmly demand that a four-nation conference of the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union be held based on the Soviet proposal.

　　The Presidium of the National Movement Council for Comprehensive Peace adopted a statement on July 21st saying: "We do not approve of holding the San Francisco conference, because this conference intends to sign a peace treaty with Japan without consulting the countries concerned, or consulting the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China, the four countries that signed the Potsdam Proclamation. The Japanese people demand an end to the occupation and full restoration of their independence and freedom. There is no true independence when foreign troops are still stationed on our territory. Moreover, in our view, the stationing of these troops and the establishment of military bases create the danger of Japan being dragged into war and becoming a battlefield. A separate peace is not a real peace, but a declaration of preparing for war."

　　The organ of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, "Sohyō," also sharply criticized the American draft separate peace treaty with Japan. "Sohyō" said in an editorial on July 20th: "How can this draft treaty, which intends to conclude a separate peace, rearm Japan, prepare for another world war, and is accompanied by secret military agreements, guarantee Japan's independence? This draft treaty means that some countries are undisguisedly and shamelessly dominating Japan. This draft treaty means the complete loss of Japan's independence."

### 日共国会议员团等团体发表声明  坚决抗议美制单独对日和约草案  反对美国武装日本对亚洲各国发动侵略

　　日共国会议员团等团体发表声明
　  坚决抗议美制单独对日和约草案 　 反对美国武装日本对亚洲各国发动侵略
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社二十九日讯：东京消息，日本的民主公众坚决抗议美制单独对日和约草案，反对美国为签订这种单独和约而在旧金山召开所谓“和会”的企图。
    七月十九日，日本共产党国会议员团发表声明，略称：假若美制对日和约草案实现，日本即将成为美国的殖民地，日本人民也将变为帝国主义者的奴隶。因为根据与单独和约同时签字的“美日安全协定”，美军仍将留驻日本，并且可以毫无限制地在日本建立军事基地与营房。
    美制对日和约草案的军事目的，是要毫无限制地重新武装日本，恢复日本的军国主义，把日本人民变为帝国主义者的雇佣兵，对亚洲人民进行侵略战争。
    这一美制对日和约草案的经济目的，是要把日本变为美国战争经济的辅助工厂，并把奴隶的劳动条件强加在日本工人的身上。
    这一和约草案的政治目的，是要压制日本人民群众的民主运动与恢复法西斯制度。
    声明继称：这一和约草案是向世界人民挑战，奴役日本民族，并对亚洲各国发动侵略。而且，它以苏联、中国与朝鲜为敌对国家。这不是和平条约而是战争条约。这是非法的，无效的。亚洲与全世界爱好和平的人民都绝不可能接受。
    共产党国会议员团在声明结语时要求：凡曾对日作战的国家都应参加准备与签订对日和约。这种和约应以开罗宣言和波茨坦公告以及雅尔塔协定为根据。而且，为这一目的而召开的和约会议，应有一切对日作战国家的参加。
    日本拥护和平委员会发表的关于美国对日和约草案的声明指出：美国打算在九月与日本缔结单独和约的计划，正在加紧实行中。大家知道，这个计划的目的在于不让苏联和中国参加签订和约，在于重新武装日本并迫使日本对这两个国家作战。此外，美国的草案是为了把日本变成一个殖民地，奴役日本人民。我们决不允许缔结这种单独和约。我们坚决要求根据苏联的建议，举行美、英、中、苏四国会议。
    全面媾和爱国运动协议会主席团七月二十一日通过一项声明说：“我们决不赞成举行旧金山会议，因为这个会议打算不经有关各国的会商，不经在波茨坦公告上面签字的美、英、苏、中四国的协商就签订对日和约。日本人民要求终止占领并充分恢复他们的独立和自由。当外国军队还驻扎在我国国土上的时候，那是没有任何真正独立可言的。不仅如此，在我们看来，这些军队的驻扎和军事基地的建立，造成日本被拖入战争和变为战场的危险。单独媾和不是真正的媾和，而是宣布准备战争。”
    日本工会总评议会的机关报“总评”也尖锐地抨击美国单独对日和约草案。“总评”报在七月二十日的社论中说：“这个打算单独媾和、重新武装日本、准备另一次世界大战并附带有秘密军事协定的和约草案，怎能保障日本的独立呢？这个和约草案意味着某些国家丝毫不加掩饰与无耻地独霸日本。这个和约草案意味着日本独立的完全丧失。
