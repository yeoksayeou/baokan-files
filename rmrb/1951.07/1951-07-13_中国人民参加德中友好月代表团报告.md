　　Report of the Chinese People's Delegation Participating in the German-Chinese Friendship Month
　　In early April of this year, the National Front of the German Democratic Republic, in order to strengthen and consolidate the friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Germany, thereby strengthening the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, prepared a nationwide "German-Chinese Friendship Month" movement, and invited a Chinese People's Delegation to Germany to participate. With the consent of our Central People's Government, the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison of the Central Committee for Culture and Education actively prepared and organized the "Chinese People's Delegation Participating in the German-Chinese Friendship Month," led by Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court. On May 31st, they arrived in Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, via the Soviet Union, and were received with the most sincere and warm welcome by people from all walks of life in Germany. The "German-Chinese Friendship Month" officially began with a grand rally held in Berlin on June 8th. After June 9th, the delegation split into groups and visited cities and villages in the capital and states of Democratic Germany, visiting factories, farms, schools, and various cultural institutions. They broadly contacted people from all walks of life through lectures, reports, seminars, press conferences, individual talks, and other means, lasting for sixteen days. On June 26th, the National Front of the German Democratic Republic and the city of Berlin held a grand farewell meeting. The delegation completed its mission in Germany and returned home via the Soviet Union on June 29th, arriving in Beijing on July 5th. This is a brief account of the delegation's trip abroad.
　　According to our very incomplete statistics, during the month that our delegation stayed in Germany, the number of people who participated in rallies attended and addressed by our delegation reached over 400,000. The number of people who participated in rallies held by local national fronts and the masses who welcomed the Chinese delegation along the way in cities and villages has not yet been counted. Such extensive direct contact between the peoples of China and Germany is unprecedented in the history of our two countries. We clearly recognize that such intimate, frank, and unreserved meetings, talks, and exchanges of struggle experiences between the peoples of our two countries would have been unimaginable and impossible at any time in history.
　　The delegation was ordered to go abroad, and all members deeply realized the importance of this mission. Because this "German-Chinese Friendship Month" movement was held under the circumstances of the unprecedented growth of the world's peace and democracy camp, the great Soviet Union successfully completed its first post-war five-year plan, the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea achieved great victories, the new democratic countries stepped onto the path of socialism, and hundreds of millions of people around the world had already signed the demand for the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty. It was also held under the circumstances of the U.S. and British imperialists being unwilling to accept their defeat, frantically preparing for and provoking war, actively arming West Germany in the West, and invading China and Korea and arming Japan in the East. At the same time, this movement was also held under the circumstances of the entire German people eagerly demanding peaceful reunification, opposing the arming of West Germany, and the German National Front winning a great victory in the national referendum in early June. Because of these reasons, the task of our delegation was not only to enhance mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Germany, exchange revolutionary experiences, and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two peoples, but also to strengthen and consolidate this enormous force to oppose U.S. aggression and defend world peace. As Chairman Mao said in his telegram to President Pieck: "The people's Germany and the people's China are both at the forefront of the great struggle against imperialism." Therefore, strengthening the solidarity and friendship between the peoples of China and Germany will greatly strengthen the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is of extreme importance in today's great struggle to defend world peace.
　　The work of organizing this "German-Chinese Friendship Month" was presided over by the National Committee of the German National Front. Before the Chinese delegation arrived in Berlin, a large-scale preparatory work had already been carried out. Before the start of Friendship Month, the democratic parties and people's organizations affiliated with the National Front issued statements explaining the significance of Friendship Month to the German people. At the same time, in order to introduce the real situation of the new China, in addition to the Chinese art exhibition held in Berlin and the "New China Exhibition" held in Leipzig, the gifts, photos, cartoons, woodcuts, books, periodicals, handicrafts, etc. brought by the Chinese delegation were displayed and exhibited in the National Front venues. In addition, 6 million copies of propaganda materials and pictorials about the new China were compiled and printed, and widely distributed to cities and villages. During Friendship Month, Chinese films dubbed in German, such as *The Victory of the Chinese People*, *Liberated China*, and *Daughters of China*, were shown simultaneously throughout Democratic Germany. Due to the traditional friendship that had long existed between the peoples of China and Germany, the German people's firm opposition to aggression and demand for peace, and the enormous mobilization work carried out by the National Front, a high tide of enthusiastic "German-Chinese friendship" had already been set off among the entire German people before the start of Friendship Month. After the Chinese delegation arrived in Germany and the grand rally was held on June 8th, "German-Chinese friendship" further became an unprecedentedly enthusiastic mass movement throughout Germany. As Chairman Correns of the National Committee of the National Front said: "All peace-loving German people sincerely admire the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and enthusiastically demand to learn from the Chinese people's experience in fighting against imperialism. At the same time, the German people also deeply admire the great construction work being carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao." With such a feeling, the German people warmly welcomed the representatives sent by the Chinese people, and the sincere and deep love they showed deeply moved all of our representatives.
　　After June 9th, the Chinese delegation split into four groups and went to the capitals of various states and cities and villages in the German Democratic Republic to visit, report on the situation in the new China, and introduce the Chinese people's struggle experience in defeating imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We visited sixty-three cities, ports, and villages in the five states of Democratic Germany, and had direct contact with more than 400,000 workers, farmers, miners, fishermen, students, youth, women, and people from cultural and artistic circles. Our two peoples have different skin colors and different languages, but a common belief and goal, that is, the lofty purpose of fighting for lasting world peace and people's democracy, broke through all obstacles between us. Every conference aroused boiling enthusiasm, and thousands upon thousands of people in every town and village the delegation passed through warmly presented flowers and saluted us in the scorching sun and even heavy rain. We cheered heartily, shook hands tightly, and embraced. We saw many German friends shedding tears of excitement when they met and spoke with us. When we visited factories and villages, many worker activist teams, tractor stations...etc. were renamed "Mao Zedong Team" and "Mao Zedong Station". Countless letters of respect and precious gifts were sent to the place where the Chinese delegation was located. This upsurge of Chinese-German friendship not only swept through Democratic Germany, but also caused a great impact in West Germany, which was divided by the U.S., British and French imperialists. The imperialists and their running dogs, fearing this friendly cooperation between the Chinese and German people, used all means of rumor-mongering, deception and intimidation to prevent the people of West Germany from contacting the Chinese delegation, but this shameless attempt was quickly shattered by the peace-loving people of West Germany. When conferences were held in the border towns and villages adjacent to Lubeck and Hamburg in West Germany, many West German people risked danger to participate. On June 21st, a mass meeting of about 800 people from West Berlin was held in the democratic zone of Berlin. These facts vividly prove that the friendship between the Chinese and German people, who stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialist aggression, is the most sincere and solid, and cannot be hindered or destroyed by the imperialists.
　　Our time in Germany was very short, and we did not have enough time to have more detailed conversations with our German friends, but without much time, we have already gained a most clear and profound impression, that is, all the German people, under the leadership of the National Front and the great President Pieck, are engaged in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland with firm confidence, a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, and selfless labor. This is the heartfelt demand of all the German people, and it is also the direction that all the German people are determined to strive for with all their might. Because this is the demand of all the German people, and because this demand is in line with the interests of the German people and the people of the world, this demand of the people is quickly transformed into a powerful and invincible force. We personally witnessed the great victory of the all-German referendum on June 3rd, and personally witnessed the great success of Democratic Germany in economic construction. What particularly excited us was that all the German people - including the people of West Germany - unanimously supported the policies and action programs of the Socialist Unity Party and the National Front, and have smoothly started the five-year plan aimed at restoring the national economy destroyed by the war. Because our two peoples are both at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, and we are brotherly countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, we sincerely regard this victory and achievement of the German people as our own joy and pride.
　　The Chinese People's Delegation participating in the German-Chinese Friendship Month went to Germany with the Chinese people's friendship towards the German people, and now we have returned to our motherland full of the German people's friendship towards the Chinese people. All members of our delegation deeply realize that the warm welcome and respect that the Chinese People's Delegation received in Germany should be attributed to the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao, and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Without these, this deep and loving exchange between the peoples of China and Germany, and the extraordinary welcome and respect that the Chinese delegation received, would have been unimaginable. Now that the German-Chinese Friendship Month has been successfully completed and the delegation's mission abroad has come to an end, strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and German people, regularly and systematically carrying out cultural exchanges between the two countries, and increasing the mutual understanding between the two peoples, in order to further strengthen the power of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, thereby opposing aggression and safeguarding world peace, is a work that requires long-term efforts in the future. We are deeply convinced that under the circumstances of the unprecedented strength of the world's peace and democracy forces, and the Chinese and German people fighting side by side for common beliefs and goals, the friendship between our two peoples will be further consolidated, and the economic and cultural relations between our two countries will surely have an epoch-making development.

　　中国人民参加德中友好月代表团报告
    今年四月上旬，德意志民主共和国民族阵线为加强和巩固中德两国人民间友好合作，借以强化以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，筹备全国规模的“德中友好月”运动，并邀请中国人民代表团赴德参加。经我中央人民政府同意，由中央文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局积极筹备，组织了以最高人民法院院长沈钧儒为团长的“中国人民参加德中友好月代表团”，于五月三十一日，经苏联到达德意志民主共和国首都柏林，备受德意志各界人民最真挚热烈的欢迎。“德中友好月”以六月八日在柏林举行的盛大集会为起点正式开始，六月九日以后，代表团分组出发，历访民主德国首都及各州的城市农村，参观工厂、农场、学校和各种文化机关，以演讲报告、座谈、记者招待会、个别谈话等等方式，广泛地与各界人民接触，历时十六日。六月二十六日德意志民主共和国及柏林市民族阵线举行了盛大的送别大会，代表团在德任务完毕，于六月二十九日离德经苏联返国，七月五日回抵北京。这是此次代表团出国的简要经过。
    据我们很不完备的统计材料，我国代表团留在德国的一个月的时期之内，只就有我国代表团参加和发表了讲话的集会群众，人数已达四十万人以上；其他由各地民族阵线召开的集会及沿途城市农村参加了欢迎中国代表团的群众，尚未统计在内。这样广泛的中德两国人民间的直接接触，在我们两国历史上还是创举，我们明确地认识，两国人民间的这样的亲切、坦白，而毫无隔膜的见面、谈话和交换斗争经验，在历史上任何一个时期都是不能想像也是不可能的。
    代表团奉命出国，全体团员一致深切地认识到此行任务的重大。因为这一个“德中友好月”运动，是在全世界和平民主阵营空前壮大，伟大的苏联胜利地完成了战后第一次五年计划，中国人民的抗美援朝运动获得了巨大的胜利，各新民主主义国家迈步走上社会主义的道路和全世界已经有亿万人民在要求五大国缔结和平公约的要求书上签上了名字的形势下举行的，也是在美英帝国主义者不甘心于他们的失败、疯狂地准备和挑拨战争，在西方积极武装西德，在东方侵略中国、朝鲜和武装日本的形势之下举行的，而同时，这个运动也是在全德意志人民热烈地要求和平统一，反对武装西德，德意志民族阵线在六月初的全国民意投票中获得了巨大胜利的形势下举行的。由于这些，我们代表团的工作任务不单是增进中德两国人民的相互了解，交换革命经验，加强两国人民的友好合作，并且还要强化和巩固这一巨大的力量，来反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平。正如毛主席致皮克总统的电文所说：“人民的德国和人民的中国同处在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争的最前线”。因此，加强中德两国人民的团结友好将大大加强以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，在今天的保卫世界和平的伟大斗争中，具有极其重要的意义。
    这次举办“德中友好月”的工作，由德意志民族阵线全国委员会主持，早在中国代表团到达柏林之前，即已进行了规模巨大的准备工作。在友好月开始之前，民族阵线所属各民主党派及人民团体发表声明，向德国人民说明友好月的意义，同时为了介绍新中国实况，除在柏林举行的中国艺术展览会，和在莱比锡城举行的“新中国展览会”之外，并将中国代表团带往的礼品、照片、漫画、木刻、书刊、工艺品等项，在民族阵线会场陈列展览，并编印了有关新中国的宣传品及画刊各六百万份，广泛地散发到城市乡村。在友好月期间，民主德国各地同时放映德语配音的《中国人民的胜利》、《解放了的中国》和《中华女儿》等中国影片。由于中德两国人民间早就存在的传统友谊，由于德国人民坚决地反对侵略、要求和平和由于民族阵线进行了巨大的动员工作，所以在友好月开始之前，全德意志人民之间已经掀起了热烈的“德中友好”的高潮。中国代表团到达德国和在六月八日举行了盛大的集会之后，“德中友好”更进一步地成了德意志全国各地空前热烈的群众运动。正如民族阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯所说：“所有爱好和平的德国人民都在衷心地钦慕中国人民革命的伟大胜利，并且热烈地要求学习中国人民反对帝国主义斗争的经验，同时，德国人民也深深地景仰着中国人民在毛主席领导之下所进行着的伟大的建设工作。”德国人民以这样的心情热烈地欢迎了中国人民所派遣的代表，他们所表现的这种真挚而深切的友爱，使我们全体代表都受了深刻的感动。
    六月九日之后，中国代表团分成四组，分赴德意志民主共和国各州首府及各地城市、农村进行访问，报告新中国情况，介绍中国人民战胜帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的斗争经验。我们历访了民主德国的五个州六十三个城市、港口、农村，与四十万以上的工人、农民、矿工、渔民、学生、青年、妇女、文化艺术界人士直接接触。我们两国人民肤色不同，语言不同，但是一个共同的信念和目标，就是为了世界持久和平与人民民主而斗争的崇高的目的，把我们之间的一切障碍都冲破了。每一次大会都激起了沸腾的热情，代表团经过的每一个城镇和乡村都有成千成万的群众在烈日以至豪雨中向我们热烈的献花和致敬。我们尽情地欢呼，紧紧地握手和拥抱，我们看到了许多德国朋友和我们见面和讲话的时候流下了激动的眼泪。我们访问工厂农村的时候，有许多工人积极分子工作队、拖拉机站……等等改名为“毛泽东队”、“毛泽东站”，更有无数的致敬函电和珍贵礼品投送到中国代表团所在的地方。这种中德友好的热潮不仅席卷了民主德国，就是在美英法帝国主义分裂下的西德，也引起了极大的影响。帝国主义及其走狗害怕这种中德人民间的友好合作，曾经用尽了一切造谣欺骗和威胁的手段来阻挠西德人民和中国代表团的接触，可是这种无耻的企图很快地就被爱好和平的西德人民所粉碎了，邻接西德卢卑克及汉堡的边界城乡举行大会的时候，有许多西德人民冒着危险跑来参加，六月二十一日并在柏林民主区举行了约有八百位西柏林人民的群众大会。这些事实生动地证明了站在反对帝国主义侵略斗争最前线的中德两国人民之间的友谊，是最真挚、最牢固的，是决非帝国主义者所能阻挠和破坏的。
    我们在德国的时间很短，我们没有充分的时间和德国朋友们作更详尽的交谈，但是，不需要太多的时间，我们已经得到了一个最明确和最深刻的印象，这就是全体德意志人民在民族阵线和伟大的皮克总统的领导之下，正在以坚定的信心，高度的爱国主义热情和忘我的劳动，从事于祖国和平统一的斗争。这是全德意志人民出自心底的要求，这也是全德意志人民决心以全力来争取的方向。由于这是全德意志人民的要求，由于这种要求符合着德意志和全世界人民的利益，因而这种人民的要求就很快地转化为强大无敌的力量。我们亲自看到了六月三日全德意志民意投票的伟大胜利，亲自看到了民主德国在经济建设上的巨大成功。在此特别使我们感到兴奋的是全德意志人民——包括德意志西部的人民在内，一致支持社会统一党和民族阵线的政策和行动纲领，并已顺利地开始了以恢复被战争破坏了的国民经济为目标的五年计划。由于我们两国人民同处在反对帝国主义斗争的前列，我们是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中的兄弟之邦，所以我们衷心地将这种德国人民的胜利和成就，当作我们自己的喜悦和骄傲。
    中国人民参加德中友好月代表团带着中国人民对德国人民的友爱前往德国，现在我们又满载着德国人民对中国人民的友爱而回到了祖国。我们全团代表深切地认识，我们中国人民代表团在德国受到这样热烈的欢迎与尊敬，应该归功于伟大的中国共产党和人民领袖毛主席的领导，与中国人民革命的胜利。要没有这些，中德两国人民的这种深挚友爱的交流，中国代表团所受到的这种异乎寻常的欢迎与尊敬，都是不能想像的。现在德中友好月已胜利完成，代表团的出国任务已经终了，但是加强中德人民友谊，经常地有计划地进行两国文化交流，增进两国人民的彼此的了解，这样来更加壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，借以反对侵略与保卫世界和平，却是今后需要长期努力的工作。我们深信：在全世界和平民主力量空前强大，中德两国人民为着共同的信念和目标而并肩奋斗的形势之下，我们两国人民的友谊必将更进一步地巩固，我们两国间的经济文化关系一定会有划时期的发展。
