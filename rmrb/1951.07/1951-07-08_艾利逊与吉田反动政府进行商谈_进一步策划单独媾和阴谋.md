　　Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: Following the conclusion of negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom regarding a separate peace treaty with Japan, Dulles's aide, Allison, traveled from London to Japan via Pakistan, India, and the Philippines to further plot a separate peace treaty and a "US-Japan military alliance" with the Yoshida reactionary government. Allison arrived in Tokyo on June 24th and, after ten days of activity, returned to the United States on July 3rd.

　　According to Kyodo News, during the talks, Allison "conveyed" to the Yoshida government the US decisions on all "long-standing pending" "important issues" since the second Dulles-Yoshida meeting in April. These issues included the so-called "China representation issue" and "reparations, economic restrictions," etc. According to a "senior Foreign Ministry official who has maintained close contact with Allison," the following items have been "clarified" in the US-Japan talks: Regarding the conspiracy to exclude the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China to the peace treaty with Japan, it was decided to adopt the absurd "agreement" of the US-UK London talks, that is, Japan would "choose" to make peace with the People's Republic of China or the Kuomintang remnant bandits. Regarding the issue of reparations, in order to appease the demands of the Philippines and other countries, a clause will be added to the separate treaty stating, "Matters concerning reparations shall be discussed among the countries concerned." Regarding economic restrictions, "in principle," provisions restricting Japanese industry will not be included in the separate treaty.

　　In order to allow the United States to freely arm Japan, the separate treaty decided "not to stipulate (Japan's) arms restrictions." During the talks, the US and Japanese reactionaries also discussed the "US-Japan Stationing Agreement," i.e., the "US-Japan military alliance."

　　After this meeting, the United States will submit its "re-drafted" peace treaty with Japan to the member states of the Far Eastern Commission, coercing them to sign. According to Kyodo News, this "new treaty" is basically the same in "content" as the US-made "Draft Peace Treaty with Japan" and "does not have much change."

　　艾利逊与吉田反动政府进行商谈
    进一步策划单独媾和阴谋
    【新华社七日讯】美英两国关于单独对日媾和的谈判结束后，参加谈判的杜勒斯的助手艾利逊自伦敦取道巴基斯坦、印度和菲律宾前往日本，与吉田反动政府进一步策划单独媾和与“美日军事同盟”。艾利逊在六月二十四日抵达东京，活动十天后，已于七月三日返美。
    据共同社透露：在会谈中，艾利逊把自四月间杜勒斯、吉田第二次会谈以来的一切“久成悬案”的“重要问题”，都向吉田政府“传达”了美国的决定。这些问题包括：所谓《中国代表问题》以及《赔偿、经济限制》等。据一直与艾利逊“保持着密切联系的外务省高级官员”透露，这次美日会谈中业已“明确”的，有下列各项：关于排除中华人民共和国对对日和约的正当权利的阴谋，决定采纳美英伦敦会谈的荒谬“协议”，即由日本“选择”与中华人民共和国或国民党残余匪帮媾和。关于赔偿问题，为了敷衍菲律宾等国的要求，单独和约中将增加《关于赔偿事项由有关各国间商议》的条款。关于经济限制，“在原则上”在单独和约中不列入限制日本工业的条文。
    为了使美国能够放手武装日本，单独和约决定“不规定（日本的）军备限制”。在会谈中，美、日反动派也讨论到《美日驻兵协定》，也即《美日军事同盟》。
    经过这次会谈后，美国将以它“重新”拟订的对日和约交付远东委员会会员国，胁迫各国签署。据共同社透露，这一“新约”，在“内容上”与美制《对日和约草案》基本一致，“没有很大变更”。
