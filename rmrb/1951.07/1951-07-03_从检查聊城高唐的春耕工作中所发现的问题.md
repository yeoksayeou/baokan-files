　　Problems Discovered in Inspecting Spring Planting Work in Gaotang, Liaocheng
    North China Spring Planting Inspection Team, Plain Area Group
    Gaotang and Liaocheng are the main cotton-producing counties in the Liaocheng Special District of Pingyuan Province. In recent years, under the active leadership and encouragement of the People's Government, the farmers in these two counties have generally shown high enthusiasm for production, and their living conditions have also been initially improved. For example, in Zhao Village, District One of Gaotang, cotton fields accounted for 42 percent of the cultivated land before the war, with an average yield of 85 jin of seed cotton per mu. Last year, the cotton fields increased to 56.5 percent, and the yield per mu increased to 102 jin. This year, the cotton fields can be further expanded to 75 percent. Another example is Han Village. Before the war, the average annual income of each person was 1031 jin of raw grain. Last year, it reached 1412 jin. Therefore, the average annual consumption of wheat per person, which accounted for only 18.8 percent of the total food consumption before the war, has now increased to 27 percent. Relatively, the consumption of coarse grains has decreased from 44.2 percent before the war to 24.4 percent now. However, the improvement of the rural economy cannot be judged solely from food consumption. Taking Han Village as an example again, according to a survey of 53 households in the village: one household has more than 3,000 jin of seed cotton in storage, two households have more than 2,000 jin, two households have more than 1,000 jin, ten households have more than 500 jin, and seventeen households have more than 200 jin. Because the farmers have savings, many have built new houses: Han Village built 33 new houses this year, Taiping Village built 21, and Yu Village built 41; there has also been a significant increase in production investment. In Han Village alone, the number of draft animals has increased by half compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land has also increased by 50 percent compared to last year. The masses are also planning to purchase pesticides and new agricultural tools to ensure a bumper harvest this year.
    Based on the above situation, the agricultural production policy formulated by the Liaocheng Special Commissioner's Office this year is to "fully mobilize and organize the masses, launch a patriotic production competition, and strive to improve the living standards of the people in the entire region and enrich national defense construction." Under this policy, the main task of the spring planting movement was clearly defined as hoeing wheat, planting cotton, and digging wells. Preparations were made through people's representative conferences, professional meetings, and cadre meetings at each level. In particular, in terms of cotton planting area, the entire special district requires an increase of 90 percent compared to last year. The Special Commissioner's Office organized more than 800 cadres twice to promote work in various counties, and together with the original cadres in each county, approximately 3,000 people were involved in this movement.
    It is worth noting the slogans put forward by the Liaocheng Special Commissioner's Office in carrying out the spring planting movement. The main ones are to reverse the situation of "the south is poor and the north is rich" in the region, and to "get rich by planting more cotton." Some even mentioned that planting more cotton is the only way to get rich. As a result of emphasizing getting rich by planting cotton ideologically, a view of simply valuing personal economic interests was formed among cadres and the masses, which objectively contributed to a tendency to disregard politics. Through an inspection of agricultural production work in the region, the following problems were further discovered:
    First, agricultural production work was not well integrated with the current political movements, and the masses' awareness was not politically raised to promote the patriotic production movement. For example, cadres grasped cotton planting and well digging very tightly, and were very determined to complete the tasks, and adopted methods of comparison and calculation to mobilize the masses, which were all very good and achieved certain results. However, not enough work was done to educate the masses by grasping the vivid materials of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For example, some people demanded that counter-revolutionaries be escorted to a certain place, and after the masses publicly poured out their grievances, they should be executed. It can be seen that the spontaneous anti-revolutionary sentiment of the masses is very high. However, Gaotang County drew 27 cadres to specialize in assisting public security and judicial departments in hearing cases, and did not do a good job in mobilizing the masses to pour out their grievances, and did not use the realistic teaching materials to launch a climax of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the countryside, resulting in a phenomenon where peasants have high enthusiasm for getting rich but low political awareness. Specific facts are that in some villages, the price of land obtained from the fruits of land reform is still half lower than the market price, new middle peasants are despised, even old middle peasants can borrow money without interest, and new middle peasants have difficulty borrowing even with high interest; old middle peasants can marry wives without spending money, and new middle peasants spend money but no one is willing to marry them. In Yan Temple, two new middle peasant households have been driven to the point of losing both their land and their people.
    Precisely because the masses were not sufficiently educated politically, a purely task-oriented view was formed in the work, digging wells for the sake of digging wells. For example, there were 255 wells in the fifth district of Liaocheng, most of which were not used, but this year they are working hard to complete 80 new wells. Because the old wells have not played their role, it is difficult to complete the new wells. Another example is Yu Village in Gaotang. The masses all reflect that the soil is not good and not suitable for watering. None of the original nine wells have been used. Instead of mobilizing to try to use the old wells to irrigate the land, they will dig three new wells and three wells in Xiaquan this year. As a result, the masses are unwilling to accept it, and some villages adopt the method of holding meetings to assign well-digging tasks, and the masses have the phenomenon of escaping. If the production tasks can be closely combined with the patriotic and abundant production of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the work will definitely be carried out well.
    Secondly, the direction of organizing was not valued and implemented to improve technology and develop production, and some cadres even worried that promoting organization would affect getting rich. For example, a district committee in Liaocheng said: "The changes are really fast. Just after opposing agricultural socialist ideology, the masses dared to get rich, and now they have to emphasize organization." However, the masses' demands for organization are very urgent, especially the new middle peasants. From the understanding of 91 households in Taiping Village, the current production conditions of the new middle peasants are not as good as those of the old middle peasants. On average, each piece of large agricultural equipment (plows, drills, harrows) of the new middle peasants has to bear 100 mu of cultivated land, and each head of livestock has to bear 38 mu of cultivated land. Each piece of large agricultural equipment of the old middle peasants only has to bear 80 mu, and each head of livestock only has to bear 27 mu. Each piece of large agricultural equipment of the rich middle peasants only has to bear 30 mu, and each head of livestock only has to bear 21 mu. The old middle peasants also have an advantage over the new middle peasants in terms of fertilizer and other means of production. In addition to the reasons mentioned earlier, the new middle peasants have declined the most in terms of class differentiation. For example, in Zhao Village, 29 households have sold their land in the past two or three years, 20 of which are new middle peasants. Among these 20 households, 6 have been reduced to poor peasants and 4 have become hired laborers. From these practical lessons of difficulties and bankruptcy, the peasants have personally experienced that organization is the only way to change from poor to rich. Therefore, some new middle peasants reflected: "In recent years, the government has not promoted mutual assistance. We want to help each other, but we don't have livestock and agricultural tools, and we can't find a target."
    The masses' spontaneous temporary labor exchanges and mutual assistance in buying livestock are quite common, according to the understanding of six villages in the two counties. For example, in Zhao Village in Gaotang, out of 276 households in the village, 175 households have a total of 138 livestock, of which only 17 are raised and used individually. Another example is Yu Village, where only 5 out of 105 households are working alone. However, due to lack of leadership, it is mostly limited to activities such as sowing, harvesting, plowing, and harrowing. In addition, some of the masses have created some more complex forms. For example, in Zhao Village, Dong Likun and two other households, one person works as a peddler and two are engaged in agriculture. The profits from business are divided according to shares, and agricultural labor is recorded according to work points. This mutual aid group combining agriculture and sideline industries has a history of ten years. In addition, there is a mutual aid group in Yu Village, which is organized by three young people and an experienced old farmer. Due to the combination of labor and technology, they can generally hoe more times than those working alone. These groups have experienced the benefits of mutual assistance and require leadership to help improve them. Of course, these are the main objects that should be supported at present. However, due to what was said earlier, some cadres are still worried that promoting organization will affect getting rich. Some, such as a district head in Gaotang, said in a self-examination report: In the past, we only advocated freedom of lending and borrowing and freedom of land sales, and did not realize that if we do not organize, the peasants cannot truly turn over economically. Therefore, the leadership of mutual aid groups was relaxed. Or they are satisfied with the form of temporary labor exchanges and do not try to improve them. For example, a district cadre in Liaocheng introduced the situation, thinking that Guo Village's mutual assistance is very good and has a history of seven years, but in fact they are all spontaneous temporary labor exchanges. Therefore, although the demands of the masses are very urgent, in fact, a movement with leadership has not yet been formed.
    Third, precisely because of the lack of good leadership and emphasis on organization, the cultivation of labor models and the combination of labor models and mutual aid groups are not done very well. According to a survey, among the 300 labor models in Gaotang County, very few are leading mutual aid groups well. Even if there are, the leadership has not summarized, established a banner, and promoted them in a timely manner. When selecting labor models, most of them are evaluated based on the quality of their individual production; when mobilizing labor models, they are only required to do a good job in their individual production. For example, when the Cotton Production Cooperative held a meeting of 160 labor model activists this year, it put forward a new record movement of producing 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, and lent 100 jin of bean cake per mu in advance, but did not propose to organize the masses to collectively increase production. This will make it easy for some labor models to adopt the method of rich peasants to operate after getting rich with our help. For example, Wang Jingtai, a labor model in Yanxinzhuang, hired long-term workers last year and bought land again this year. Another example is that households selling land in Zhao Village have accounted for 1.5 percent of the total number of households, households selling land in Hantun have accounted for 11.3 percent, and households selling land in Yanxinzhuang have accounted for more than 20 percent. Ten out of 70 households in Wulipu hire long-term workers. These phenomena are worthy of our attention. It must be pointed out that in a new democratic society, the existence and development of rich peasants are allowed, but this is not the direction of development for peasants. The correct direction of development should be to organize and take the road of cooperatives.
    Fourth, from the perspective of the entire grassroots leadership, there is still a problem: at the district level, the division of labor includes civil affairs, finance, construction, education, public security, armed forces, youth, and women. Each has a full-time job, and the strength is not only unable to be unified, but even dispersed, so that no one is doing the central work. The work of each system is also only busy with statistical figures and listening to reports from village cadres, and rarely goes deep into the masses to help village cadres, discover problems, and solve problems, so that village cadres feel that district cadres only want tasks, which increases troubles. Only a part of the main cadres in the village are actively working and playing a leading role, and there is still a lack of adopting various organizational forms to absorb more people to participate in leadership, and to give full play to the role of collective leadership in an organized manner. Some production committee members still cannot play a significant role. Technical committees or technical groups have not been universally established, and the strength of each system has not been brought into play, so that a few cadres are busy promoting and completing tasks, and cannot educate and improve the masses through various organizations, according to the season, to formulate plans, make summaries, evaluate, and select models, so that the masses can experience the leadership role and establish a collective concept.

　　从检查聊城高唐的春耕工作中所发现的问题
    华北春耕检查团平原小组
    高唐和聊城，是平原省聊城专区的主要产棉县份，近年来，两县农民在人民政府的积极领导与奖励下，生产情绪，普遍高涨；生活条件，也初步得到改善。如高唐一区赵庄，战前棉田占耕地面积百分之四十二，每亩平均产籽棉八十五斤，去年棉田增至百分之五十六点五，每亩产量提高到一百○二斤。今年棉田可再扩展到百分之七十五。又如韩屯，战前每人每年平均收入原粮一○三一斤，去年达一四一二斤。因此，战前每人每年所吃小麦，平均只能占总食粮消费量的百分之十八点八，现在则已增到百分之二十七。相对的，粗粮的消费量，便已从战前的百分之四十四点二，减退到了现在的百分之二十四点四。不过农村经济的好转，还不能单从食物的消费上来看。仍以韩屯为例，据该村五十三户的调查：存籽棉三千斤以上者一户，两千斤以上者两户，一千斤以上者两户，五百斤以上者十户，二百斤以上者十七户。由于农民有了积蓄，修盖新房的很多：韩屯今年盖了新房三十三间，太平庄盖了二十一间，于庄盖了四十一间；增加生产投资的也很不少，即韩屯一村，耕畜较去年添了一半，每亩田地的施肥量，也较去年增多了百分之五十。群众还正在筹划购买杀虫药械、新式农具，以保证今年的丰产。
    基于以上的情况，聊城专署今年所制定的农业生产方针，就是“全力发动组织群众，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，为提高全区人民生活水平，充实国防建设而奋斗”。在这一方针下，首先明确地提出了春耕运动的主要任务是锄麦植棉和打井。通过人民代表会议、专业会、干部会逐级布置，进行准备。特别在植棉面积方面，全专区要求较去年增加百分之九十。专署曾两次组织了八百多干部，到各县推动工作，加上各县原有干部，约共三千人投入了这一运动。
    值得注意的是聊城专署在开展春耕运动时所提出的口号，其主要的，一个是扭转该区南穷北富的局面；一个是要发家多种花。有些甚至提到多种棉花就是发家的唯一道路，由于在思想上，这样强调了为发家而种花的结果，形成了干部与群众的单纯重视个人经济利益的观点，客观上助长了不问政治的倾向。通过对该区农业生产工作的检查，更发现了如下几个问题：
    首先是没有使农业生产工作与当前政治运动很好地结合，从政治上提高群众的觉悟，以推动爱国生产运动。例如干部对植棉和打井，都抓得很紧，完成任务的决心也很大，而且采用对比算账的办法来动员群众，这都是很好的，也都收到了一定的效果。但是对抓住抗美援朝、镇压反革命的生动材料，教育群众的工作则表现得不够。例如有些群众要求将反革命分子押到一定地点，经过群众公开诉苦后，再行处决，可见群众自发的镇压反革命的情绪很高。但高唐县却抽了二十七个干部，去专门帮助公安、司法部门审案子，没有很好地发动群众诉苦，把现实的教材运用起来，使抗美援朝与镇压反革命运动在农村中掀起高潮，以致造成农民中发家的情绪高、政治觉悟低的现象。具体的事实有如某些村庄，至今土地改革果实地的地价，要比市价低一半，新中农受人鄙视，甚至老中农不出利可以借到钱，新中农出高利也难借到；老中农娶老婆不花钱，新中农花了钱也没人肯嫁给他。阎寺即有二户新中农闹得人地两空。
    正因为在政治上对群众的教育不够，所以在工作上也形成了单纯任务观点，为打井而打井。如聊城五区原有水井二五五眼，大部都没有使用，但今年又在为完成八十眼新井而努力，由于旧井没有发挥效用，新井也难完成。又如高唐于庄，群众全反映土质不好不宜于浇水，原有水井九眼全未应用，不去发动试用旧井浇地，今年还要打新井三眼，下泉三眼，结果群众不肯接受，有些村采用开会的方式，来分派打井，群众有逃避的现象。如果生产任务，能够和抗美援朝爱国丰产、镇压反革命运动密切地结合起来，工作一定能够开展得好。
    其次，没有重视和贯彻组织起来的方向，以改进技术发展生产，甚至使有些干部顾虑提倡组织起来，会影响发家。如聊城一个区委说：“变化的实在快，刚反对了农业社会主义思想，群众才敢于发家，现在又要强调组织起来。”但群众对于组织起来的要求，却非常迫切，特别是新中农。从太平庄九十一户中了解，当前新中农的生产条件，还赶不上老中农，新中农的大农具（犁、耧、耙）平均每件要负担耕地一百亩，每头牲口要负担耕地三十八亩，老中农每件大农具只要负担八十亩，每头牲口只要负担二十七亩。富裕中农每件大农具仅只要负担三十亩，每头牲口仅只要负担二十一亩了。施肥及其他生产资料，老中农也比新中农占优势，更加上前边所说的若干原因，在阶级分化上，新中农下降最多，如赵庄，两三年来先后有二十九户出卖了土地，其中二十户是新中农。而这二十户中，已有六户降为贫农，四户成为长工。农民从这些困难和破产的实际教训中，已切身体验到组织起来是由穷变富的必由之路，因此有些新中农反映：“这几年政府也不提倡互助了，我们想互助，但没有牲口、农具，找不到对象。”
    群众自发的临时?犋，伙买牲口的互助形式，据在该两县六个村的了解，相当普遍。如高唐赵庄，全村二七六户中，有一七五户共有牲口一三八头，其中仅十七头是单养单用的，又如于庄一○五户中仅有五户是单干的。但因缺乏领导，多限于播种、收割、耕耙等活动上。另外，也有部分群众，创造了一些较复杂的形式，如赵庄董立昆等三户，一人作小贩二人从事农业，经商利润，按股分红；农业劳力，按工记帐，这个农副业结合的互助组，已有十年历史，此外于庄有个互助组，是由三个青年和一个有经验的老农组织起来的，他们由于劳力与技术的结合，能比单干地普遍多锄一遍。这些组，已体验到互助的好处，要求领导帮助提高，当然这都是目前应该扶持的主要对象。但是由于前面所说，有的干部还顾虑着提倡组织起来会影响发家。有的如高唐一个区长在检讨性的报告时表示：过去我们只是提倡借贷自由、土地买卖自由，没有意识到假如不组织起来，农民就不能在经济上真正翻身。因而也就放松了互助组的领导。或则满足于临时?犋的形式，不设法加以提高。如聊城一个区干部介绍情况时，认为郭庄的互助很好，已有七年历史，其实那都是些自发的临时?犋。所以虽然群众的要求很迫切，但事实上还没有形成有领导的运动。
    第三，正因为没有很好地领导与重视组织起来，所以对劳动模范的培养，劳动模范与互助组的结合做得非常不够。据调查全高唐县的三百个劳动模范中，很少是领导好了互助组的。即便有，领导上也未及时总结，树立旗帜，加以推广。选拔劳动模范时，大多是以他个人生产的好坏来评定；动员劳动模范时，也只要他把个人的生产搞好。如今年棉产社召开一百六十个劳动模范积极分子的会议时，提出了每亩生产籽棉三百斤的新纪录运动，并事先贷给每亩豆饼一百斤，但未提出组织群众集体增产。这样会使有些劳动模范虽在我们帮助下把生产搞好，可是发家以后，很容易采用富农方式去经营。如阎辛庄劳动模范王景泰，去年雇长工，今年又买地。又如赵庄卖地户已占总户数的百分之一点五，韩屯卖地户已占百分之十一点三，阎辛庄已占百分之二十强，五里铺七十户人家中有十户雇长工，这些现象都是值得我们注意的。必须指出，在新民主主义社会，固然允许富农的存在与发展，但这并不是农民发展的方向。正确的发展方向，应该是组织起来，走合作社的道路。
    第四，从整个基层领导上来看，还存在着一个问题：在区一级，分工有民政、财政、建设、教育、公安、武装、青年与妇女，各有专职，力量不但不能统一，甚至还分散了，以致中心工作反而没有人做。各系统工作也只忙于统计数字和听村干部报告，很少深入群众，帮助村干部，发现问题和解决问题，致使村干部感到区干部只要任务，给增加麻烦，村上只有一部分主要干部在积极工作起带头作用，还缺乏采用多种多样的组织形式，吸收更多人参加领导，有组织地发挥集体领导作用，有些生产委员，还起不了很大的作用，技术委员会或技术小组，还没有普遍地建立起来，各系统力量也没有发挥，使少数干部忙于推动和完成任务，不能通过各种组织，根据季节，制定计划，作总结，评比，选模范等方法，以教育与提高群众，使群众体验到领导作用，树立起集体观念来。
