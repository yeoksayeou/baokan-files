　　Certain Leading Cadres in Southern Shanxi Neglect Cotton Purchasing Work
    Local Higher-Level Leading Organs Should Immediately Pay Attention to Correction
    Certain county and special district leading cadres in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province have adopted an impermissible attitude of procrastination towards the current urgent national task of purchasing and storing cotton. Jinnan is the main cotton-producing area of Shanxi Province. After the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on purchasing and storing cotton, the CCP committees and people's governments at the special district level made urgent arrangements and calls. However, in some counties, due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of this work by leading cadres, coupled with insufficient inspection by the special district leading organs, they have not yet fully mobilized. Fencheng County in Linfen Special District is one example. Although the special commissioner's office urged them several times by telephone, the leading organs of Fencheng County remained passive about this work. The secretary of the county people's government said, "Our county has no cotton in storage at all." There were also instances of neglect of this work in Yuncheng Special District. On June 18, the Yuncheng Special District convened a ten-day material exchange conference, transferring responsible cadres such as county heads, cooperatives, and cotton yarn and cloth company teams from various counties to attend, which greatly affected the work of purchasing and storing cotton. The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative General Office instructed all cooperatives to fully cooperate in carrying out cotton purchasing work; however, the Yuncheng Special District Cooperative believed that it would hinder the establishment of cooperatives and refused to implement it. The cotton purchasing and storage work teams dispatched by the leading organs of the special district to various counties were all newly graduated students from the raw cotton training class and administrative cadre schools. They were neither familiar with the situation nor had they obtained the cooperation of the local CCP committees and people's governments, and they encountered obstacles everywhere. The situation in Yuncheng Special District is as follows: When the cotton yarn and cloth company team of Xia County requested the county's cooperation in carrying out cotton purchasing and storage work, Deputy County Head Chen Quanlu replied, "This is your business." Jishan County has not yet arranged cotton purchasing and storage work. Although Linjin County made arrangements early, cadres did not leave the county seat for the countryside to convey the message until the 15th of this month. Ronghe County, which accounts for one-quarter of the cotton purchasing task of Yuncheng Special District, did not assist the cadres sent by the cotton yarn and cloth company. When the cotton purchasing and storage work team returned to the county on the 15th to report, the responsible cadres of the CCP committee and the people's government did not attend. The cotton purchasing and storage work in the county was only incidentally arranged and mobilized at two meetings of county, district, and village cadres on the 17th of this month. At present, in Yuncheng Special District, except for Jie County, Anyi, and a very small number of key villages in other counties, in some counties, this serious political task still remains in the words of the cadres. As of June 20, Yongji County's purchase figure was only 0.022 percent of the full month's task. The figure completed by Yuncheng Special District in twenty days of June was only slightly more than one-third of that in May. (Jing)
    Editor's note: The fact that certain county and special district leading cadres in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi Province do not pay attention to the task of purchasing and storing cotton indicates that these comrades are politically numb and will not consider issues from the perspective of the interests of the entire country. It is a very serious political problem that yarn factories are shutting down due to a lack of raw cotton, and that some cotton farmers have cotton in storage but refuse to sell it! In order to solve this problem, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has made a decision, and the CCP Central Committee has also issued instructions. Every cadre, especially those working in cotton-producing areas, should list it as one of their primary tasks. However, some cadres believe that this is "not their business" and leave it to a few economic work cadres to play a solo role. This intolerable state of political numbness should attract the serious attention of the local leading organs, who should immediately conduct strict criticism and help them come up with solutions.

### 山西南部某些领导干部忽视购棉工作  当地上级领导机关应即注意纠正

　　山西南部某些领导干部忽视购棉工作
    当地上级领导机关应即注意纠正
    山西省南部产棉区某些县和专署的领导干部，对国家当前紧急的购棉储棉工作采取不能容许的拖延态度。晋南是山西省主要产棉区，中央人民政府政务院发布关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，专区一级中共党委和人民政府虽然作了紧急的布置与号召，但某些县份由于领导干部对这个工作的重要性认识不足，加上专区领导机关检查不够，直到现在仍未全面行动起来。临汾专区汾城县就是一个例子。专署虽然在电话上督促了好几次，汾城县领导机关却仍然对这个工作表示消极，该县人民政府秘书说：“我县根本没有存棉。”运城专署也有忽视这个工作的情形。六月十八日，运城专署召开为期十天的物资交流会议，将各县县长、合作社、花纱布公司小组等负责干部都调来开会，使购棉储棉工作受到很大影响。山西省合作总社曾指示各地合作社建社大队全体配合开展购棉工作；运城专区合作社却认为妨碍建社，不予执行。该专区领导机关派往各县的购棉储棉工作队，都是原棉训练班和行政干部学校新毕业的学生，既不熟悉情况，又未取得中共地方党委和人民政府的配合，到处碰壁。运城专区的情况是：夏县花纱布公司小组向该县请求配合进行购棉储棉工作，副县长陈全禄回答说：“这是你们的事。”稷山县直到现在还未布置购棉储棉工作。临晋县虽布置的早，干部直到本月十五日才从县城动身下乡传达。占运城专区购棉任务四分之一的荣河县，对花纱布公司派出的干部不加协助。十五日购棉储棉工作组返县汇报，中共党委和人民政府的负责干部也没有参加。该县购棉储棉工作于本月十七日才开始在县区与村干部两个会议上附带进行了布置动员。目前运城专区十七县，除解县、安邑与其他县极少数基点村外，在某些县份，这一严重的政治任务还停留在干部的口头上。永济县至六月二十日止，收购数字仅及全月任务的百分之零点零二二。运城专区六月份二十天中完成的数字，仅等于五月份的三分之一强。（经）
    编者按：山西南部产棉区某些县和专署领导干部不重视购棉储棉任务，表示这些同志在政治上是麻木的，是不会从整个国家的利益上考虑问题的。纱厂因缺乏原棉而停工，若干棉农有存棉而拒绝出售、这是非常严重的政治问题！为了解决这个问题，中央人民政府政务院作了决定，中共中央也发了指示，每一个干部，特别是在产棉区工作的干部，应该把它列为自己的首要工作之一。但是，有些干部却认为这“不是自己的事”，一任几个经济工作干部唱独角戏。这种不能容忍的政治上的麻木状态，应该引起当地领导机关的严重注意，立即进行严格的批评，并帮助他们想出解决的办法。
