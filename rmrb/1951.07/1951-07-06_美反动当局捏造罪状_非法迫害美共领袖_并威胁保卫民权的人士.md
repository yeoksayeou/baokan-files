　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th—According to a TASS dispatch from New York, seventeen cadres of the American Communist Party, who were illegally arrested on June 20th, appeared in New York Federal Court on July 3rd and expressed their disagreement with the charges fabricated by the government.

　　After the U.S. judicial authorities unconstitutionally sentenced eleven leaders of the U.S. Communist Party to imprisonment based on the Smith Act, they immediately followed suit by cooperating with police agencies to search for and arrest another twenty-one leaders of the U.S. Communist Party, similarly filing public charges against them under the absurd charge of "inciting the overthrow of the government by violence."

    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息，在上月二十日被非法逮捕的美国共产党十七名干部于七月三日到纽约联邦法庭出庭，表示不服政府捏造的罪状。
    美国司法当局根据斯密司法在违宪判处美共十一位领袖徒刑之后，即援例会同警察机关搜捕另外二十一位美共领袖，照样以无稽的“教唆以暴力推翻政府”罪名提起公诉。
