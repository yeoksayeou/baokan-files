　　US Government Frantically Tramples on Human Rights
    Judicial Authorities Continuously Violate Constitutional Provisions
    Tyrannically Persecuting Civil Rights Congress Staff
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch] Following the recent large-scale persecution of American Communist Party leaders, the US judicial authorities have further and more crudely trampled on several constitutional provisions guaranteeing human rights and more barbarously persecuted democratic forces.
    On July 5th, the New York Federal Court sentenced Feild, the administrator of the bail fund for the "Civil Rights Congress," which provided bail for the arrested American Communist leaders, to three months in prison on the grounds that he refused the judge's unreasonable demand that they hand over the list of donors to the bail fund, thus committing the crime of "contempt of court." On July 9th, the court arrested two other administrators of the fund – Hammett, chairman of the New York State branch of the "Civil Rights Congress" and a famous writer, and Dr. Hunton, secretary of the "Council on African Affairs" and a leading progressive Black leader in the United States. After forcing them to hand over the list of donors to the bail fund and being refused, they were sentenced to six months in prison on the same grounds.
    After intimidating the "Civil Rights Congress" to no avail, Federal Court Judge Ryan, at the request of Inspector Saypol, issued a shameful court order on the 11th, declaring the bail paid by the "Civil Rights Congress" for the fifteen Communist leaders arrested on June 20th (there were originally seventeen people arrested, but two were released due to illness) invalid. As a result, the fifteen Communist leaders were imprisoned that day. Defense lawyers pointed out during the defense that canceling the "Civil Rights Congress" bail was to deprive the arrested American Communist leaders of their right to bail. The defense lawyer asked the court for time to prepare a defense brief, but Judge Ryan once again violated the most basic conditions of judicial procedure, insisting that a defense brief could still be prepared after the defendant was imprisoned, and flatly rejected the defense lawyer's request.
    Patterson, the secretary of the "Civil Rights Congress," issued a statement on the judicial authorities' arrest of the People's Bail Fund administrators of the Congress, saying that the United States government and its courts have joined forces to repeatedly violate the constitutional rights of the American people. Communists and non-Communists alike are gradually becoming victims of a Nazi-style war-mongering movement that undermines the Bill of Rights. The statement called on all peace fighters to strive to demand that the Washington authorities end the fascist-style movement to undermine the US Constitution.

　　美政府疯狂蹂躏人权
    司法当局连续破坏宪法规定
    蛮横迫害民权保障大会职员
    【新华社十六日讯】美国司法当局在最近大肆迫害美国共产党领袖之后，已进一步更粗暴地蹂躏美国宪法若干保障人权的规定和更蛮横地迫害民主力量。
    纽约联邦法院在七月五日已对为被捕美共领袖提供保释金的“民权保障大会”保释金基金管理人费尔德，判处了三个月徒刑，理由是他拒绝法官要他们交出保释金基金捐助人名单的无理要求，因而犯了“蔑视法庭”罪。七月九日，该法院又拘捕了该基金的另外两个管理人——“民权保障大会”纽约州分会主席、名作家哈麦特和“非洲事务委员会”秘书、美国进步黑人领袖韩顿博士，在逼迫他们交出保释基金捐助人名单而遭到拒绝后，又以同样理由判处了他们六个月的徒刑。
    在恫吓“民权保障大会”无效之后，联邦法院法官赖恩竟又在检查官赛波尔的要求下，于十一日发布了一项可耻的法院命令，宣布“民权保障大会”为六月二十日被捕的十五位共产党领袖（当时捕的原有十七人，二人因病释出）缴纳的保释金无效。结果，十五位共产党领袖即于当日下狱。被告辩护律师在辩护时指出：取消“民权保障大会”的保释金，就是剥夺被捕美共领袖的保释权。辩护律师要求法院给予时间，以准备辩护词，但是法官赖恩又一次破坏司法程序的最基本条件，硬说在被告监禁后仍可准备辩词，而悍然拒绝了辩护律师的要求。
    “民权保障大会”书记派特逊为司法当局拘捕该会人民保释金管理人一事发表声明说：美国政府及其法庭已经联合起来，接二连三地破坏美国人民的宪法权利。共产党也好，非共产党也好，都同样地逐渐变成破坏人权法案的纳粹式挑拨战争运动中的牺牲品了。声明号召所有的和平战士竭力要求华盛顿当局结束法西斯式的破坏美国宪法的运动。
