    CCP Fengyang County Committee, Wanbei
　  Inspecting the Patriotic Pact Movement
    Editor's Note: In late June, reader Wu Changlin wrote to us, pointing out that many units in Linhuaiguan Town, Fengyang County, Wanbei, had serious tendencies toward formalism when establishing patriotic pacts. We immediately forwarded this to the CCP Fengyang County Committee, Wanbei, for inspection. According to the inspection results, the situation reflected by Comrade Wu Changlin was indeed accurate; the Fengyang County Committee also corrected this tendency. This tendency may occur in other regions as well. In order to draw attention to this issue in various regions, we are publishing the inspection report from the Propaganda Department of the CCP Fengyang County Committee below; and we hope that readers in various regions will inform us of any problems found in the establishment of patriotic pacts.
        To the Editor:
    Comrade Wu Changlin's criticism of the formalistic tendencies in our county's Linhuaiguan Town in the establishment of patriotic pacts is correct. One week before receiving your letter, we conducted an inspection of the establishment and implementation of patriotic pacts by people from all walks of life in Linhuaiguan Town. We are now informing you of the inspection results.
    In general, the patriotic pacts in Linhuaiguan Town have played a certain role in promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and various central tasks. After workers established patriotic pacts, they made achievements in various aspects such as improving production, protecting state property, and participating in political activities. For example, all 500 workers in the stevedore union demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm when transporting large quantities of food grains for Huai River management. They voluntarily started work early and finished late, and continued to transport even when the weather was cloudy and the roads were slippery, and increased the load capacity of each vehicle; as a result, they exceeded the daily task by 20%. They also paid close attention to protecting state assets, and immediately tried to salvage any broken grain bags; at night, they also organized a picket team to guard the grain and prevent theft. They also assisted the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and reported and captured four special agents. In the donation movement, all the workers voluntarily volunteered to work one day every two weeks, donating the wages earned to purchase airplanes and cannons, and it is estimated that 60 million yuan can be donated in six months. In addition, the weaving industry union and the bathhouse industry union in the town also performed well after establishing patriotic pacts. After merchants established patriotic pacts, they actively participated in collective tax payments, and incidents of tax evasion and speculation have been basically eliminated.
    However, because some units did not fully mobilize the masses before establishing patriotic pacts, and did not go through serious discussions by the masses when establishing patriotic pacts, the formalistic tendency of the patriotic pacts is very serious. For example, the patriotic pact of the tile industry workers was decided by a few union cadres and then read out at the general meeting and "passed," so the masses could not implement the patriotic pacts well. Of the more than 90 workers in the industry, less than 30 knew the content of the patriotic pacts. Even more seriously, the patriotic pact of the directly subordinate station for Huai River management was drafted only by the station chief, deputy station chief, and accountant, and other cadres did not know about it. The content of such a patriotic pact is empty. Some patriotic pacts are only some slogans such as "intensify production and support the front," without specific requirements; therefore, it is difficult to implement and it is impossible to check the effect of implementation. The articles of some units' patriotic pacts are divorced from reality and cannot be implemented at all. For example, the patriotic pact of the stevedore union stipulates that each worker should plant three cents of land for vegetables, but many workers have no land at all, and no time to plant vegetables. As a result, only 20% of the people did this during the inspection. Due to the leadership's intervention, everyone adopted a perfunctory attitude towards the establishment of patriotic pacts, and it was considered finished after it was established. For example, the industry and commerce sectors emphasized separate household subscriptions, and as a result, some households copied the clauses of other households. Some households submitted the patriotic pacts they had subscribed to the trade association for "reference" and did not keep a copy for themselves. Some households avoided the important and focused on the unimportant, subscribing to a few insignificant empty clauses. In addition, after the shop employees union and others established patriotic pacts, the leadership put things aside, neither publicizing them to the masses in depth nor checking the implementation, which made the masses' thinking generally lax. As a result, when they remembered to check, the original patriotic pacts could not be found.
    These situations are very serious. We have combined the implementation of the three major calls of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to correct this. Comrade Wu Changlin's letter has made us more deeply aware of the seriousness of this issue; we thank Comrade Wu Changlin for his concern for our work, and hope that the broad masses will put forward more opinions on our work in the future to help us do our work better.

### 中共皖北凤阳县委员会  检查爱国公约运动

专栏：读者来信

    中共皖北凤阳县委员会
　  检查爱国公约运动
    编者按：六月下旬，读者吴长林来信提出：皖北凤阳县临淮关镇很多单位在订立爱国公约时有着严重的形式主义偏向，我们当即转请中共皖北凤阳县委员会对此进行检查。根据检查结果，吴长林同志所反映的情况是确实的；中共凤阳县委员会并对这种偏向进行了纠正。这种偏向，在其他地区也可能发生。为了引起各地注意，特将中共凤阳县委员会宣传部的检查报告发表于后；并且希望各地读者都能将订立爱国公约中发现的问题告诉我们。
        编辑同志：
    吴长林同志对我县临淮关镇订立爱国公约中形式主义偏向的批评是正确的。在接到你们来信的前一星期，我们曾对临淮关镇各界人民订立、执行爱国公约情况进行了一次检查。现将检查结果告诉你们。
    总的说来，临淮关镇的爱国公约对抗美援朝运动和各项中心工作已起了一定的推动作用。工人们订立爱国公约后，在提高生产、爱护国家财产、参加政治活动等各方面都有了成绩。如搬运工会全体工友五百人，在搬运大批运到的治淮食粮时，发挥了高度的积极性。他们自动早上班晚下班，天阴路滑照常搬运，并加多每辆车的载重量；结果每天超额完成任务百分之二十。他们对保护国家资财也很注意，发现粮包破了就赶紧设法抢救；夜里还抽出工人组织纠察队看守粮食，防止偷盗。他们还协助政府镇压反革命，检举、捕获了四个特务分子。在捐献运动中，他们全体工人自愿每两周义务劳动一天，把所得工资捐献购买飞机大炮，预计六个月可捐出六千万元。此外，该镇织布业工会、浴业工会工人在订立爱国公约后也有了很好的表现。商人订立爱国公约后，都踊跃参加了集体纳税，漏税和投机倒把的事件已基本肃清。
    但是，由于某些单位在订立爱国公约前没有充分发动群众，在订立爱国公约时没有经过群众认真的讨论，爱国公约的形式主义偏向是很严重的。如瓦业工人的爱国公约即是少数工会干部议定后到全体大会上宣读一下就“通过”的，因此群众对爱国公约就不能很好地执行。该业工人九十多人，知道爱国公约内容的还不到三十人。更严重的，如治淮直属站的爱国公约，仅由正、副站长及会计三人拟订，其他干部都不知道。这样订出的爱国公约，内容是空洞的。有些爱国公约只是一些“加紧生产，支援前线”等口号式的条文，而无具体要求；因此既难执行，也无法检查执行的效果。有些单位的爱国公约订的条文脱离实际情况，根本无法执行。如搬运工会的爱国公约上订了每个工人要种三分地的菜，而许多工人根本没有地，也没时间种菜。结果在检查时，只有百分之二十的人做到了这一条。由于领导干部的包办，大家对订立爱国公约也采取了应付态度，订过就算完了。如工商界各行业强调分户订立，结果有些户就把其他户的条文照抄。有些户订了爱国公约交同业公会“备查”，自己也不留底。有些户避重就轻地订了几条无关重要的空头条文。又如店员工会等订立爱国公约后，领导上就搁下了事，既不向群众深入宣传，也不检查执行情况，使群众思想普遍松懈。结果到想起要检查时，原订的爱国公约已经找不着了。
    这些情况是很严重的。我们已结合贯彻抗美援朝总会三大号召，对此进行纠正。吴长林同志的来信使我们更加深刻地认识了这个问题的严重性；我们感谢吴长林同志对我们工作的关心，并希望广大群众今后对我们的工作多提出意见，帮助我们把工作做得更好。
