　　Reverse Pessimistic and Disappointed Sentiments, Resolutely Strive for a Bumper Cotton Harvest!
　　Farmers in Pingyuan Province Fight to Completely Eliminate Cotton Aphids
　　Pingyuan Province has reversed the pessimistic and disappointed sentiments among cadres and the masses, and the work of capturing and killing aphids has been fully launched, forming a movement. Currently, farmers throughout the province are fighting to completely eliminate cotton aphids and strive for a bumper cotton harvest.
　　Before the end of June, the masses in various parts of Pingyuan Province had carried out one to two rounds of aphid eradication work, thus greatly reducing the aphid infestation. However, later, due to the paralyzing thoughts of leaders in many areas, who believed that a general treatment had been carried out, and it had rained, so it didn't matter. They relaxed their attention to aphid infestation, and since the beginning of July, aphid infestations in various places have greatly developed. For example, in the Heze Special District, out of 880,000 mu of cotton fields, 770,000 mu were infested with aphids. Among them, the cotton leaves in 400,000 mu had already withered. Therefore, the phenomenon of destroying cotton seedlings and replanting other crops occurred everywhere. Due to the sudden and severe aphid infestation, the masses generally developed pessimistic and disappointed sentiments. Many cadres also lost confidence and simply asked their superiors for solutions.
　　In order to reverse the pessimistic and disappointed sentiments among cadres and the masses, the local committees of the Chinese Communist Party and the special commissioner's offices in the province recently issued instructions separately and organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to lead aphid control. The secretaries of the prefectural committees, commissioners, and county heads all went to the countryside to conduct inspections and assistance, held various meetings, established aphid control headquarters, organized cadre forces, and taught farmers how to use insecticides. Now, aphid control work has been universally launched throughout the province, forming a mass movement. In order to further promote the thorough completion of this work, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government called on all localities to pay special attention to the following issues: First, all cadres and the masses must further recognize that eliminating cotton aphids is a serious political task at present. If cotton aphids are not eliminated, it will not only affect the increase in cotton field production (it is understood that a reduction in production in 400,000 mu of cotton fields in the Heze Special District is a foregone conclusion), and increase the difficulty of expanding cotton fields next year, but also directly affect the current purchase and storage of cotton. Therefore, leading organs at all levels should deeply implement patriotic ideological education, so that the masses understand that in order to build the country's industry, they must resolutely fight against aphid infestation and achieve victory. Second, call on Party members, League members, militia, labor models, and activists from various organizations to take the lead, lead the broad masses, including women and children, to participate fully, and continue the unremitting struggle against cotton aphids until the aphid infestation is completely eradicated. Third, local farms and cooperatives must effectively help farmers solve the difficulties of technology and agents. Fourth, educate the masses of farmers to accept past lessons and implement the principle of "universal treatment, continuous treatment." Fifth, pay attention to summarizing existing experience, implement patriotic ideological education, closely link the personal interests of farmers with the national interests, fully mobilize the masses, and prevent some cadres from adopting coercive and commanding methods against the masses due to the urgency of the task.

### 扭转悲观失望情绪，坚决争取棉花丰收！  平原省农民为彻底消灭棉蚜而斗争

　　扭转悲观失望情绪，坚决争取棉花丰收！
　  平原省农民为彻底消灭棉蚜而斗争
    平原省扭转干部和群众中的悲观失望情绪，捕灭蚜虫工作全面展开，形成运动。目前全省农民正为彻底消灭棉蚜、争取棉花丰收而斗争。
    六月底以前，平原省各地群众都进行过一次至两次灭蚜工作，棉蚜虫害因而大大减轻。但后来由于不少地区领导上产生了麻痹思想，认为已普治一遍，又下了雨，不要紧啦。对蚜害放松了注意，因此七月初以来，各地的蚜害又有很大发展。如菏泽专区棉田八十八万亩，有七十七万亩生了蚜虫。其中四十万亩棉叶已经枯萎。因此毁了棉苗改种其他作物的现象到处发生。由于蚜害突趋严重，群众又普遍产生了悲观失望情绪。不少干部也因而失去信心，单纯向上级要办法。
    该省中共各地委及各专署为扭转干部和群众中的悲观失望情绪，于最近分别发出指示，并组织大批干部下乡，领导治蚜。地委书记、专员、县长等都分头下乡进行检查、帮助，召开各种会议，建立治虫指挥部，组织干部力量，把使用杀虫器械的方法教给农民。现在全省治蚜工作已普遍展开，形成群众性的运动。省委与省府为进一步推动这一工作的彻底完成，并号召各地特别注意以下几个问题：第一，要使全体干部群众进一步认识消灭棉蚜是当前严重的政治任务。不把棉蚜消灭，不仅会影响到棉田增产（据了解：菏泽专区四十万亩棉田减产已成定局），增加明年扩大棉田的困难，而且已直接影响到当前购棉储棉工作的进行。因此各级领导机关应深入贯彻爱国主义思想教育，使群众了解为了国家的工业建设，必须与蚜害坚决斗争，取得胜利。第二，号召党员、团员、民兵、劳动模范及各组织的积极分子起带头作用，率领广大群众，包括妇女儿童，全部参加，向棉蚜继续进行不疲倦的斗争，直到将蚜害完全扑灭为止。第三，各地农场和合作社要切实帮助农民解决技术与药剂的困难。第四，教育农民群众接受以往教训，贯彻“普遍治、连续治”的方针。第五，注意总结已有经验，贯彻爱国主义思想教育，把农民个人利益与国家利益密切联系起来，充分发动群众，防止某些干部因任务紧急而采取对群众强迫命令的办法。
