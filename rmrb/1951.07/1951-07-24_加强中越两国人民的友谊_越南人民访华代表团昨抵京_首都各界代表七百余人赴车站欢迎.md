    [Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd] To strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, all circles of the Vietnamese people have specially sent a Vietnamese People's Delegation to visit our country. The delegation, led by Huang Quoc Viet, Vice Chairman of the Lien Viet Front (formerly translated as the Vietnam National United Front), arrived in Beijing at 8:20 this morning. Those who went to the station to welcome them included: Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; and representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, including Zhang Bojun, Ma Xulun, Xing Xiping, Peng Zemin, Xu Deheng, Liang Xi, Shi Liang, Shao Lizi, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Wang Shao'ao, Zhu Xuefan, Xu Zhizhen, Kang Keqing, Luo Shuzhang, Li Chang, Xie Bangding, Yu Xinqing, and over 700 representatives from all circles in the capital.
    Zhou Liang, First Secretary of the Vietnamese Delegation in China, also went to the station to greet them.
    After the Vietnamese People's Delegation got off the train, they received flowers from the Young Pioneers amidst enthusiastic applause. A brief welcoming ceremony was then held at the station.
    Vice Chairman Li Jishen delivered a welcoming speech to the Vietnamese People's Delegation. He first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the representatives of the Vietnamese People's Delegation, and paid high tribute to the Vietnamese military and civilians who are bravely fighting in the liberation war and to their great leader, President Ho Chi Minh. He then said: China and Vietnam are neighboring countries as closely related as lips and teeth, and the people of the two countries have a long history of friendship. Especially in the past century, in the common struggle against imperialism and feudalism for national independence, people's democracy, and lasting peace in the Far East and the world, the people of China and Vietnam have shown brotherly unity and love. He also pointed out that the great victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao has inspired the Vietnamese people who are engaged in the liberation war; similarly, the arduous and unyielding spirit of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh in carrying out the liberation war for several years is also worthy of learning and drawing lessons from by the Chinese people. He concluded by saying: At present, the imperialist forces headed by US imperialism are carrying out frantic aggression in the Far East. In order to oppose imperialist aggression, the people of China and Vietnam should unite more closely and strive for peace in Asia and peace in the world.
