　　International Developments
  The Anger of the British People
    The American troops stationed in Britain held a celebration ceremony for the American "Independence Day" in the British capital on July 4. American flags were flying everywhere, American bands were playing in the streets, and American troops were marching in formation. This arrogant action aroused the anger and protest of London citizens.
    One hundred and seventy-five years ago, the Americans gained independence from the rule of the British Empire. Now is the time for the British people to fight for independence from the American Empire.
        Morrison Reverses the Facts
    British Foreign Secretary Morrison recently said: The situation of Iranian oil fields has made Britain "intolerable".
    The Iranian people have tolerated British economic aggression for half a century. Now they can no longer tolerate it and want to take back their oil fields. Morrison said that this has made Britain "intolerable". This is obviously the aggressor's way of reversing the facts.

  英国人民的愤怒
    驻英美国军于七月四日在英国的首都举行美国“独立纪念日”庆祝典礼，到处美国国旗飘扬、美国乐队在街上演奏，美国驻军列队行进。这种盛气凌人的行动引起了伦敦市民的愤怒和抗议。
    一百七十五年前，美国人从大英帝国的统治下获得了独立，现在是英国人向美利坚帝国争取独立的时候了。
        莫里逊颠倒事实
    英国外相莫里逊最近说：伊朗油田的情况，已经使得英国“不能容忍”。
    伊朗人民对于英国的经济侵略已容忍了半个世纪，现在他们不能再容忍了，要把自己的油田收回去；莫里逊却说这使得英国“不能容忍”。这显然是侵略者颠倒事实的说法。
