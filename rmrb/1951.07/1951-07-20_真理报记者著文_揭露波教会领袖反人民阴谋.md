　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: According to a TASS Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* published a dispatch from Warsaw by Makarenko on the 17th entitled "Enemies of Democratic Poland." Makarenko said: The anti-people activities of the highest leadership of the Catholic Church in Poland have aroused the growing anger of the Polish people. Since the establishment of the Polish Republic, the reactionary leaders of the Polish Catholic Church have been carrying out subversive activities. They want to rely on the assistance of American imperialism to restore the regime of the bourgeoisie and landlords, and to separate Poland from the camp of peace, democracy and socialism. Church leaders are using the pulpit to call on believers to undermine the measures of the democratic government and the Polish United Workers' Party. The enemies of Poland are trying to use the Catholic Church and charitable organizations as a haven for various hidden anti-people elements.

　　Makarenko pointed out: Many Catholic priests are members of the underground fascist organization "Mikolajczyk Group" subsidized by Washington and London. Various organizations of the Catholic Church are carrying out the tasks of the Vatican intelligence agency - a part of the American intelligence agency. Last year, senior leaders of the Catholic Church in Poland attempted to obstruct the signature campaign for the Stockholm Peace Appeal. They refused to sign until the Polish signature campaign had been completed, and only then did they have to sign the Peace Appeal for fear of losing the little influence they had left among the masses. This year, during the national people's peace vote in Poland, the leaders of the Catholic Church did not dare to openly express their opposition, and were forced to sign the Peace Covenant Declaration. But at the same time, they attempted to organize large-scale religious gatherings in Silesia, Lublin, and even Warsaw during the people's vote to obstruct the national peace vote.

　　Makarenko went on to say: The Pope praised the anti-people activities of the senior Polish Catholic leaders. When Archbishop Wyszynski of the Polish Catholic Church recently visited the Vatican, Pope Pius XII received him twice, gave him greater power, and promised him the position of cardinal. Makarenko emphasized: The Vatican's policy toward the Polish Republic is subordinate to the American plan to dominate the world. However, the Polish people are increasingly aware that the Vatican is the enemy of peace and democracy, and they are resolutely exposing the anti-people conspiracies of the reactionary Catholic leaders.

　　揭露波教会领袖反人民阴谋
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十七日刊载马卡伦科的题为《民主波兰的敌人》的华沙通讯。马卡伦科说：波兰天主教教会最高领导机构的反人民活动，已引起波兰人民日益增长的愤怒。波兰天主教教会的反动首领们从波兰共和国成立以来，就进行着颠覆活动。他们想依靠美帝国主义的援助，来恢复资产阶级和地主的政权，使波兰脱离和平、民主和社会主义的阵营。教会的领袖们在教堂的宣讲台上号召信徒们破坏民主政府和波兰统一工人党的措施。波兰的敌人正设法利用天主教会和慈善机关，作为各种暗藏的反人民分子的避难所。
    马卡伦科指出：许多天主教神甫都是华盛顿和伦敦津贴的地下法西斯组织“米柯拉兹科团”的成员。天主教会的各种组织执行着梵蒂冈情报机关——美国情报机关的一部分——的任务。去年，波兰的天主教教会高级首领们曾企图阻挠斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名运动。他们拒绝签名，直到波兰签名运动已经完成的时候，才因为害怕失去他们残留在群众中的一点影响，而不得不在和平宣言上签名。今年，在波兰举行全国人民和平投票期间，天主教教会首领们不敢冒险公开地表示反对，迫不得已地在和平公约宣言上签了名。但同时他们却企图在人民投票期间，在西里西亚、卢布林甚至在华沙，组织大规模的宗教集会来阻挠全国性的和平投票。
    马卡伦科接着说：罗马教皇对波兰天主教高级首领们的反人民活动备加赞扬。波兰天主教教会大主教韦兴斯基最近访问梵蒂冈时，罗马教皇庇护十二世曾两度予以接见，并授以更大的权力，答应给以红衣主教的位置。马卡伦科强调指出：梵蒂冈对波兰共和国的政策，是服从美国称霸世界的计划的。但是，波兰人民已愈来愈明白：梵蒂冈就是和平和民主的敌人，他们正坚决地揭露反动天主教首领们的反人民阴谋。
