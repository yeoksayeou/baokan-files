Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, July 17th: The Jinghan Railway "February 7th" Old Workers Delegation, which came to Hankou Jiang’an Railway Station for the public trial of Zhao Jixian, the murderer of the "February 7th" Massacre, sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao on the 16th after the bandit Zhao was executed. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

　　We are old workers of the Jinghan Railway from the "February 7th" era. Today, we are reporting to you a great joyous event. Zhao Jixian, the former Director of the Jinghan Railway Bureau, the murderer who caused the "February 7th" Massacre and slaughtered our workers twenty-eight years ago, was executed today at the Jiang’an Railway Station in Hankou, in front of the martyrs' spirits.

　　The goals and rights that the martyrs fought for twenty-eight years ago have all been achieved today. We have escaped the poverty and hardship of the past and are living a happy life. This year, the government also promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations, which further guarantees our lives. Now, the vast majority of our railway workers are participating in political and cultural studies. Comfortable dormitories, apartments, canteens, and clubs have been established in all stations, sections, and factories. Our children attend school and receive government subsidies. Workers are actively producing for the economic construction of their country, and many model workers have emerged. Many of our "February 7th" old workers have become various models, some have gloriously joined the Party, and some have been promoted to leading cadres. Xingcheng in the Northeast, Beidaihe in the North, Hangzhou in the South, and other scenic spots that were once used for the ruling class's enjoyment have now established railway employee sanatoriums and resorts, and are planning to build large-scale nursing homes and nurseries, so that our vast number of employees have support in their old age, care for their young, and can receive good treatment and recuperation when they are sick. This summer, many railway labor models will go to scenic spots for summer vacation and holidays.

　　Respected Chairman Mao, we cannot express the happiness you have created for us in a short time. We deeply realize that without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the realization of all this would be unimaginable.

　　In order to defend our hard-won achievements, we guarantee to you: 1. Work actively, produce diligently, do a good job in railway transportation, and strive to enrich national defense and defend world peace by carrying out the production increase and contribution movement to the end. 2. We must actively take the lead in various work and production, and teach our skills and experience to young workers without reservation, and train them to become production experts. 3. Strengthen cultural learning, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time learn culture and scientific knowledge from young workers. 4. Strive to carry out the democratic reform movement and strive to improve production efficiency! 5. We must educate our children and tell them to follow you forever! Follow the Communist Party!

　　With highest respect,
      Jinghan Railway "February 7th" Old Workers Delegation

　　京汉路“二七”老工人代表团
    电毛主席致敬
    他们亲眼看到了制造“二七”惨案的主犯伏法，决心更加努力生产。
    【新华社汉口十七日电】前来汉口江岸车站公审“二七”惨案凶犯赵继贤的京汉铁路“二七”老工人代表团，在赵匪伏法后，特于十六日电毛主席致敬。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是“二七”时代京汉铁路的老工人。今天特向您报告一件大喜事。就是二十八年前制造“二七”惨案屠杀我们工人的凶犯前京汉铁路局局长赵继贤，今天在汉口江岸车站烈士们的灵前伏法了。
    二十八年前，先烈们所争取的目标与权利，今天都达到了。我们已经摆脱了过去穷困与辛酸的日子，过着愉快的生活。今年政府又颁布了劳动保险条例，我们的生活就更有保障了。现在我们铁路工人绝大部分都参加了政治学习与文化学习，各站、段、厂都建立了很舒适的宿舍、公寓、食堂和俱乐部。我们的子女一样的上学读书，还得到政府的补助。工人们都为自己国家的经济建设而积极生产，涌现了很多劳动模范。我们“二七”老工人已有不少成为各种模范，有的光荣加入了党，有的被提拔为领导干部。现在东北的兴城、北方的北戴河、南方的杭州等这些过去供统治阶级玩乐的风景区，现在已建立起铁路职工疗养所和休养所，并且正在大规模地筹建养老院和托儿所，使我们广大职工老有所依，幼有所养，有疾病能够很好的治疗与休养。今年暑期铁路上将有不少的劳动模范前往风景区避暑与休假。
    敬爱的毛主席，您给我们缔造的幸福，一时是说不尽的。我们深深地体验到，这一切的实现，没有中国共产党与您的领导，是不能想像的。
    为了保卫我们既得的胜利果实，我们向您提出保证：一、积极工作，努力生产，大力搞好铁路运输，为开展增产捐献运动充实国防与保卫世界和平而奋斗到底。二、我们要在各项工作与生产中积极带头，并且要把自己的技术与经验无保留地教给青年工人，培养他们成为生产能手。三、加强文化学习，加强马列主义与毛泽东思想学习，同时向青年工人学习文化和科学知识。四、努力开展民主改革运动，为提高生产效率而努力！五、我们要教育我们的子女，叫他们永远跟着您走！跟着共产党走！
    致崇高的敬礼
      京汉铁路“二七”老工人代表团上
