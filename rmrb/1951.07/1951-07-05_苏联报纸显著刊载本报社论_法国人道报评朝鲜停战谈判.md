Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 4th: Today, Pravda, Izvestia, Trud, Krasnaya Zvezda, and Komsomolskaya Pravda all prominently published the People's Daily's July 3rd editorial, "Striving for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 4th: The French Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, wrote on the 2nd that General Kim Il-sung, Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in their reply to Ridgway's notification, reflected the desire for peace repeatedly expressed by the Korean and Chinese people.

　　The newspaper recounted that the purpose of the American aggression against Korea was to extend the war through Korea into China, but despite the unspeakable atrocities committed by MacArthur and Ridgway, they failed to achieve this goal. The newspaper then wrote: "The heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers taught a lesson to the arsonists who burned Seoul and Andong, and it was the primary reason for sobering them up." "Another reason is the indifference and aversion of the American people and the invading soldiers to this war. Finally, it should be said that this is the first important retreat of the warmongers in the face of the protests of all peace-loving people."

　　L'Humanité concluded: "Although the people have already forced the warmongers to accept these negotiations, in order for the negotiations to achieve their purpose, the people must continue to strengthen their pressure."

　　苏联报纸显著刊载本报社论
    法国人道报评朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社莫斯科四日电】此间真理报、消息报、劳动报、红星报、共青团报今日均以显著地位登载人民日报三日的《为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗》的社论。
    【新华社布拉格四日电】法国共产党机关报《人道报》在二日写道：朝鲜人民军总司令金日成将军和中国志愿军司令员彭德怀将军对李奇微通知的答复，反映了朝鲜和中国人民所再三表明的对和平的愿望。
    该报追述，美国侵略朝鲜的目的是要把战争经过朝鲜引入中国，但是尽管麦克阿瑟和李奇微作尽了种种说不出的暴行，他们都没有能够达到这个目的。该报接着写道：“朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军的英雄战斗，是使纵火焚烧汉城和安东的家伙们得到了一个教训，是使他们脑筋清醒过来的首要原因。”“另外一个原因是美国人民和侵略军士兵对这个战争的冷淡和厌恶。最后，应该说这是战争贩子在全体爱好和平的人民的抗议前面的第一个重要退却。”
    《人道报》最后写道：“人民虽然已经迫使战争贩子接受这次谈判，但是为了使谈判能够达成其目的，人民必须继续加强他们的压力。”
