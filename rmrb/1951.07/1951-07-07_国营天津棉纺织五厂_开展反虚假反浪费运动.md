Following the anti-waste and anti-falsehood campaign, the state-owned Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory No. 5 has established all of its production targets (i.e., preliminary quota targets or experience targets), completing the first stage of implementing quota management. The factory's production targets include four items: quantity, quality, material consumption, and staffing. The factory's method for formulating production targets, in addition to using the original records or temporary tests from the workshops to find the preliminary figures for the targets, focuses on mobilizing the masses of workers to expose and overcome shortcomings such as falsehoods and waste in production. Production targets formulated on the basis of low labor productivity and waste and falsehoods cannot be used as a basis for formulating plans and guiding production.

In April, the factory began to launch an anti-waste and anti-falsehood campaign. Through this campaign, the carding room's regularity of lap formation rate increased to over 93%. The spinning room's monthly yarn breakage decreased by more than two-thirds. The slashing room's waste yarn per machine decreased by two-thirds. During the campaign, various departments identified various false phenomena caused by the unsound record-keeping and statistical systems in the past, and established workshop original record-keeping and comprehensive statistical systems to eliminate these false appearances.

In the early stages of the anti-waste and anti-falsehood campaign, some cadres and workers in the factory had a complacent attitude. Some said, "Yarn breakage has been reduced by more than 80% compared to the past, which is almost enough!" Others said, "The records are much more accurate than before, what else is false?" In response to these ideological situations, the trade union and the administrative side compiled the waste statistics for the entire factory in April, wrote out the unit prices, and mobilized all workers and cadres to calculate the waste account, so that they could understand the losses caused by waste to state property. The spinning room held an exhibition of defective products, displaying piles of broken yarn, waste silk, etc., calculating their value, and organizing workers to visit. After this education, all the workers and cadres of the factory felt that the waste was still serious, and they were determined to fight to eliminate waste.

Then the trade union set the main problems of waste in each workshop as the main goals of the anti-waste competition campaign in May, and set specific requirements and standards. The trade union further led the workers to formulate anti-waste patriotic covenants for the groups to achieve these requirements. After the competition was launched, the workers actively looked for the main causes of waste, and came up with many ways to improve technology and operation to eliminate waste and implement the anti-waste patriotic covenant. For example, the workers in the spinning room found that the reason for the high number of loose-footed yarns in April was that the doffers were trying to be fast and did not tighten the yarn tubes when doffing. So they implemented the fixed-position doffing method and eliminated the loose-footed yarn. For example, the workers in the carding room found that the reason why many laps were not up to standard in the past was due to problems with the flower feeding, so they improved the flower feeding method and the regulator, so that the regularity of lap formation rate immediately increased. In addition, the spinning room workers implemented the one-finger-length splicing method, and the winding department workers implemented the re-winding method, which greatly reduced the phenomenon of waste.

In the development of the anti-waste movement, a small number of workers in the factory did not fully understand the significance of saving, and in order to compete for the red flag, there were fraudulent phenomena such as throwing away good cotton and hiding waste silk. After discovering these phenomena, the trade union immediately educated the workers, pointing out the promotion of collectivist heroism and opposing individual championship, so that the movement was brought into the normal track.

### 国营天津棉纺织五厂  开展反虚假反浪费运动

　　国营天津棉纺织五厂
    开展反虚假反浪费运动
    经过反浪费反虚假运动，国营天津棉纺织五厂已将全部生产指标（即初步定额指标或经验指标）订出，完成了实行定额管理的第一阶段的工作。该厂生产指标包括定量、定质、定料和定员四项。该厂制订生产指标的方法，除了依据车间的原始纪录或临时测验找出指标的初步数字，更重要的是发动职工群众揭发并克服生产中的虚假和浪费等缺点。因为在低下的劳动生产率与浪费、虚假的基础上所制订的生产指标，是不能作为制订计划、指导生产的依据的。
    四月，该厂开始展开了反浪费反虚假运动。经过这一运动，该厂清花间正卷率提高到百分之九十三以上。细纱间每月坏纱减少了三分之二以上。浆纱间每部机器的回丝减少了三分之二。各部门在运动中检查出了因过去纪录统计制度不健全而产生的各种虚假现象，并建立了车间原始纪录和综合统计制度，以消灭这些虚伪假象。
    在反浪费反虚假运动初期，该厂部分干部和工人曾存在着自满情绪。有的说：“坏纱比过去已减少了百分之八十几，差不多了！”有的说：“纪录比过去真实多了，还有什么虚假？”针对着这些思想情况，工会和行政方面把全厂四月份的浪费统计出来，写出单价，发动全体工人干部算浪费账，使他们认识浪费对国家财产所造成的损失。细纱间举办了残品展览会，把坏纱、回丝等一堆堆地陈列起来，算出价值，组织工人参观。经过这些教育以后，全厂工人和干部都感到浪费依然严重，都下决心要为消灭浪费而斗争。
    接着工会把各车间浪费中的主要问题，定为五月份反浪费竞赛运动的主要目标，并订出了具体的要求标准。工会又进一步领导工人订出了实现这些要求的小组反浪费爱国公约。竞赛开展后，工人都积极地寻找造成浪费的主要原因，并想出许多改进技术和改进操作的办法来消灭浪费，实现反浪费爱国公约。如细纱间工人找出四月份毛脚纱多的原因，是落纱工图快，落纱时没有把纱管插紧。于是他们就实行了落纱定位工作法，把毛脚纱消灭了。又如清花间工人找出过去许多花卷不合规格的原因是喂花有毛病，于是改进了喂花工作法和调节器，使正卷率立即提高。此外，细纱间工人实行接头一指长头法，打轴科工人实行倒轴工作法等都使浪费现象大为减少。
    在反浪费运动发展中，该厂少数工人对节约意义认识不够，为了争红旗，曾产生了扔白花、藏回丝的作弊现象。工会在发现这些现象后，立即对工人进行教育，指出提倡集体英雄主义，反对个人锦标主义，使运动纳入了常轨。
