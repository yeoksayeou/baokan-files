Grammar and Rhetoric Talk (Lecture 2)
    Lü Shuxiang　Zhu Dexi
  Fifth Section: Several Commonly Used Words
    "Problem." The original meaning of "problem" was something being "asked." Now, the meaning of "ask" has gradually disappeared. For example, "Do you have any problems learning Russian?" is equivalent to saying "Do you have any difficulties?"; "There are many problems in the work" is equivalent to saying "There are many shortcomings"; "There is a problem with the time" is equivalent to saying "The time is not suitable." With such a broad meaning, it is used particularly frequently, and a sentence may use several "problems," for example:
    (1) The second problem is the problem of looking at the problem of where to put oneself. This is a fundamental problem of understanding, analyzing, and even dealing with problems, that is, a problem of standpoint. (Periodical) If used improperly, it will cause confusion. For example:
    (2) The problem of food is something everyone knows. (Periodical)
    (3) Some problems we only know are good, but we don't know the reasons why they are good. (Newspaper)
    Example (2) should use "important," and example (3) should use "things."
    (4) Naturally, they currently have difficulties, but these difficulties are only a matter of time. (Periodical)
    (5) As for the high water level of the river mentioned in the letter, the sluice gates should be opened. After contacting the Bureau of Hygiene and Engineering, the bureau stated that it was due to summer rain and not a matter of closing the sluice gates. (Letter)
    Only when judging that something will inevitably happen sooner or later should "matter of time" be used, such as saying "Liberating Taiwan is only a matter of time." The "matter of time" in example (4) is used incorrectly and should be "temporary." The "problem" and "relation" in example (5) are baffling. It is unknown what problem or relation is being referred to. The original intention was probably to say "The high water level of the river is due to heavy summer rain, not due to the closing of the sluice gates."
    (6) Besides, the birth of infants in the future will seriously affect the quiet problem of single dormitories. (Periodical)
    (7) In the past, when prisoners' sentences expired, they were released from the prison gates and no longer cared for. Now, for the problem of prisoners' work after release, we also try to find ways to introduce them to jobs. (Periodical)
    (8) Regarding the problem of teachers, they are elected by everyone. (Periodical)
    All three "problems" are superfluous, because what is affected is "quietness," what is introduced is "work," and what is elected is "teachers." "Problem" cannot be "affect," nor can it be "introduce" or "elect." The "problem" in (6) should be deleted; (7) should be changed to "Prisoners after being released should also be taken care of as much as possible, and introduced to work"; (8) should be changed to "As for teachers, they are elected by everyone."
    "Relation." "Relation" originally only indicated the "relation" between things, for example:
    (9) The relation between Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese revolution is the relation between arrow and target. (Mao)
    (10) And thoughts and emotions must also generally reach a considerable level. Otherwise, there can be no relation with literature and art. (Lu)
    Now, the meaning of "relation" has expanded and is often used to express meanings such as "reason" or "cause," such as saying "Prices have risen due to the relation of currency inflation." This kind of statement can sometimes cause confusion. For example, saying "Due to age relation, he cannot participate in the parade," "he" may be a five- or six-year-old child, or he may be a seventy- or eighty-year-old elderly person. This sentence will only not cause misunderstanding when spoken to someone who knows who "he" is. If you say "Due to being too young (or too old)," the meaning is clear. Let's look at some more examples:
    (11) Some women were heartbroken and cried because they were not admitted due to condition relations. (Periodical)
    (12) Before Beijing was liberated, she married a rich man because of environmental and living relations. (Periodical)
    The "condition relations" in (11) is very vague. Why not say "unsuitable conditions"? (12) can say "because of the bad environment and difficult life."
    (13) But in the end, it could not be specifically resolved due to the school's financial difficulties relation. (Periodical)
    (14) Due to the People's Volunteer Army strictly implementing the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" relation, the rumors about the Volunteer Army that the South Korean people had heard before were all self-defeating. (Periodical)
    Both of these "relations" are unnecessary and should be deleted.
    "Process." "Process" is different from "period" or "duration": the former refers to the entire course of an event from beginning to end, while the latter only refers to time. Therefore, "the process of the Anti-Japanese War" and "the duration of the Anti-Japanese War" have completely different meanings. Here are some examples of mixed use:
    (15) In the process of him serving as principal... (Work)
    (16) I am an unemployed person. I haven't found any job from a year and a half ago until now. In this process, the hardship of life is of course conceivable. (Letter)
    Both of these examples should use "period." (The latter example is too verbose, and "any job" is also inappropriate. It would be better to change it to "I haven't found a job in a year and a half.")
    (17) After a process of experimentation, we feel that the provisions of this system are of great help in promoting work. (Periodical)
    (18) After going through some painful processes, my learning attitude has greatly changed. (Work)
    (19) In the process of translation work, you have to put in a lot of effort to understand what kind of language to use to translate this passage. (Periodical)
    The first two examples should be changed to "period." (Also, we don't say "a process," let alone "some processes," but only say "a period of process" or "a period of time.") (19) If you say "when translating," it will be much simpler and clearer. (Also, "understand" is inappropriate and should be changed to "research.")
    "Gao" (搞). "Gao" is a word absorbed from the Southwest dialect. The original meaning is equivalent to "do" or "make." Now its influence is growing, and it can be used to replace many verbs. For example, "gao work" (do work), "gao it up" (mess it up), "gao love" (date), "gao engineering" (study engineering), "everyone gao one" (everyone write one)... etc. Although this word is "infinitely changeable," it is not absolutely "always successful," for example:
    (20) My wife is now gao elementary school teacher work here. (Letter)
    (21) When the land reform work ended, gao local bullies began. (Manuscript)
    (22) Internal disunity, gao each other's prejudices. (Periodical)
    (20) Wouldn't it be simpler to say "be an elementary school teacher"? (21) It would be better to say "struggle against local bullies." (22) Should say "have opinions."
    "Grasp." "Grasp" means "seize" and "control," such as saying "grasp the whole situation" or "grasp the time." The following sentences use it incorrectly:
    (23) A study group was quickly established, and everyone was grasped to attend large classes every day. (Periodical)
    (24) When the representative meeting was held, the variety shows at the conference were not grasped enough in advance. (Periodical)
    (25) General official documents are managed and stored by the document section of the secretariat, and special ones are grasped independently by each department. (Periodical)
    The "grasp" in (23) is too vague and it is unknown what it refers to. (24) is probably saying "not enough preparation." (25) Should say "keep." (Also, "manage and store" is fabricated.)
    "Cause." The meaning of "I pay attention to this matter" can be expressed in four different ways: (A) I pay attention to this matter; (B) I pay attention to this matter; (C) This matter makes me pay attention; (D) This matter causes my attention.
    (A) (B) is a group, the subject is "I" (the initiator). (C) (D) is a group, the subject is "this matter" (the passive). The meanings of these two groups are not exactly the same. Group (A) (B) emphasizes the initiator "I," and "I" actively pay attention to "this matter"; Group (C) (D) emphasizes the passive "this matter," and "this matter" is quite special, and I have to pay attention. Now (B) and (D) are often combined to say: (E) I have caused attention to this matter. This statement is not good for two reasons. First, it doesn't make sense logically, because it is the "matter" that "causes attention," not "I," and "I" cannot "cause" my own "attention." Second, this is the most verbose of the five statements.
    (26) Cadres... have never caused attention to this unreasonable production system, causing major losses in production. (Newspaper)
    (27) According to the current atmosphere, literary theorists, critics, and most readers are extremely likely to cause unpleasant feelings about this kind of work. (Periodical)
    (26) There are two ways to change (B) (D): either say "Regarding this unreasonable production system, cadres have never paid attention," or say "This unreasonable production system has never caused the attention of cadres." (27) can only use the (D) method of changing: "This kind of work is extremely likely to cause unpleasant feelings for literary theorists, critics, and most readers."
    Suffer, Receive, Encounter. "Suffer" has a narrower range than "receive" and can only be used for unfortunate or unfavorable things. However, the two words have one thing in common: they can only be followed by transitive verbs, for example:
    (28) The comfort group received a warm welcome from the Korean people. (Newspaper)
    (29) American imperialism suffered a serious blow. (Newspaper)
    "Encounter" is often used in conjunction with nouns, such as saying "encounter difficulties" or "encounter the enemy." The following three sentences are wrong:
    (30) From January to March 1950, the business community in Beijing, like the business community across the country, suffered difficulties due to the disappearance of false purchasing power in the market. (Periodical)
    (31) At that time, if I didn't join the Kuomintang, I would suffer unemployment. (Manuscript)
    (32) During the Spring Festival, she also received New Year greetings from the local New Year greeting team in Hangzhou, calling her the glorious mother. (Periodical)
    "Difficulties" is a noun, and "unemployment" is an intransitive verb, which cannot be used with "suffer." The "suffer" in (30) should be changed to "encounter" or "meet." (31) should say "...will be unemployed." The error in (32) is that a sentence form is added after "received." It should delete "received" and simply say "The local New Year greeting team in Hangzhou also went to give her New Year greetings."
    Worth. The subject and object of "worth" are often confused, for example:
    (33) This is a gratifying phenomenon, and every young person is worth rejoicing. (Periodical)
    (34) The company has achieved such excellent results not long after its establishment, and all sectors of society are worth paying attention to. (Newspaper)
    (33) It is not "every young person" who is worth rejoicing, but "the gratifying phenomenon," and it should be said "worth every young person rejoicing." (34) It is not "all sectors of society" that are worth paying attention to, but "excellent results," and it should be said "worth all sectors of society paying attention to."
    (35) The new art of the people's era is worth learning from this great and precious heritage. (Document)
    This is confusing "worth" with "should." Moreover, "art" itself will not learn. It should be changed to "New art workers in the people's era should learn from this great and precious heritage." If "worth" is retained, it can be changed to "This great and precious heritage is worth the new art workers of the people's era learning from."
    Exist. "Exist" is an intransitive verb, its subject can be in front, for example:
    (36) Isn't this kind of subjectivist style still existing among many comrades? (Mao) It can also be in the back (compare examples 10 and 11 in Section 4 of Lecture 1), for example:
    (37) Among some comrades, this kind of tendency does exist. (Mao)
    (38) But this kind of typicality does exist, and it is quite numerous. (Mao)
    "Exist" is very close in meaning to "have," such as the "exist" in examples (37) and (38) can be changed to "have," but the "have" in these two sentences is a verb without a subject (compare example 2 in Section 4 of Lecture 1), and what is behind it is the object, while what is after "exist" is its subject. The "have" with a subject (indicating possession) cannot be changed to "exist." "I have a book" cannot be said "I exist a book"; "China has a history of five thousand years" cannot be said "China exists a history of five thousand years."
    (39) Gradually I felt that many shortcomings existed in me. (Letter)
    (40) Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties' Buddhist and Taoist temples universally existed in various parts of North China. (Periodical)
    The "existing" in (39) should be changed to "have." (40) should say "Everywhere in North China there are..."
    (41) The ideological problems existing in Comrade Yang are indeed very serious. (Periodical)
    (42) But from another point of view, there are still many weaknesses existing. (Manuscript)
    These two "exist" are useless and should be deleted.
    Basically. If you say "All of China has basically been liberated," it means that most areas have been liberated except for a few areas. If you say "China is basically an agricultural country," it means that China mainly relies on agricultural production (although there is also some industry, but the proportion is very small). It can be seen that saying something is "basically" like this is equivalent to saying it is "essentially" like this. We use this word to make our speech more precise and accurate. If you are sloppy, the "basically" in the above two sentences can be omitted, saying "All of China has been liberated" or "China is an agricultural country." Recently, this word has been used too much, and its meaning is very vague, losing its original rigor and accuracy. For example:
    (43) The propaganda and mobilization work of our factory has basically achieved some results. (Manuscript)
    (44) Encountered some basic difficulties. (Periodical)
    (43) If it is really "basically" successful, then it is definitely more than just "some"; if there are only "some" achievements, then you cannot say "basically." The "basically" in (44) is used too vaguely; it is unknown whether it means "encountered fundamental difficulties" or "encountered some difficulties."
    Certain. "Certain" has the same meaning as "specific." For example:
    (45) All culture or literature and art belongs to a certain class, a certain party, that is, a certain political line. (Mao)
    (46) People of a certain group, standing in a certain class position for a long time, that is, standing in a certain social production position, in a certain way, producing, living and fighting for a long time. (Liu Shaoqi)
    Now it is often used to express the meaning of "considerable." For example:
    (47) What he did is naturally incorrect, but there are certain reasons. (Periodical)
    (48) This problem has certain typicality, and many readers may participate in the discussion. (Periodical)
    The meanings of "certain" and "considerable" do have similarities, but the emphasis is different. For example, when we say "What he did has certain reasons," the meaning of this sentence is affirmative, which is equivalent to saying "What he did has reasons." If you say "What he did has considerable reasons," it is not completely affirmative, but only says: there are some reasons. (47) It has been affirmed in the front that "doing this is not correct," and the following can only use "considerable," not "certain." (48) The example is too roundabout, and it is common to say "This problem is quite typical."
    (49) He also performed well during a certain period. (Periodical)
    Why not say "He also performed well sometimes"?
    (50) The formation of this kind of thinking has its certain historical roots. (Periodical)
    "Certain historical roots" has become a cliché. In fact, this "certain" is superfluous, and the meaning is just as clear without it.

　　语法、修辞讲话（第二讲）
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
  第五段  几个常用的词   
    问题。“问题”原来是有所“问”的，现在“问”的意义已渐渐湮没。譬如“你学俄文有没有问题？”等于说“有没有困难？”；“工作中存在许多问题”等于说“存在许多缺点”；“时间有问题”等于说“时间不合适”。意义这样宽泛，用得也特别频繁，一句话里可能用上好几个“问题”，例如：
    （一）第二个问题是把自己列在哪一边看问题的问题。这是认识问题、分析问题以至处理问题的根本问题，亦即立场问题。（期）用得不恰当，便发生含混的毛病。例如：
    （二）食物的问题，是每个人都晓得的。（期）
    （三）有些问题我们光知道好，但好的原因就不知道了。（报）
    （二）例该用“重要”，（三）例该用“事情”。
    （四）自然目前他们是有困难的，而这困难只是时间问题。（期）
    （五）至于函内所称河水高涨，应开放闸门，经与卫生工程局联系，据该局称，因系夏季雨水关系，并非关闭闸门问题。（信）
    断定一件事迟早必然发生，才用“时间问题”，如说“解放台湾只是时间问题”，（四）例的“时间问题”用错了，应该说“暂时的”。（五）例一个“问题”，一个“关系”，叫人摸不着头脑。不知道指的什么问题，何种关系。原意恐怕是说“河水高涨是因为夏季雨水大，并非由于关闭闸门”。
    （六）何况将来婴孩的出生必将严重地影响单身宿舍的安静问题。（期）
    （七）过去犯人刑期已满，推出监门就不管了，现在对于犯人出狱后的工作问题，也尽量设法介绍。（期）
    （八）关于教员问题，是由大家推选的。（期）
    三个“问题”都是多余的，因为影响的是“安静”，介绍的是“工作”，推选的是“教员”。“问题”是既不能“影响”，也不能“介绍”或“推选”的。（六）的“问题”应删，（七）应改为“对于出狱后的犯人也尽量照顾，给他们介绍工作”，（八）应改为“至于教员，是由大家推选的”。
    关系。“关系”原来只表示事物之间的“关系”，例如：
    （九）马列主义与中国革命的关系，就是箭与靶的关系。（毛）
    （十）而思想和情感也须大抵达到相当的水平线。否则，和文艺即不能发生关系。（鲁）
    现在“关系”的意义扩大了，往往用来表示“原因”“缘故”一类意思，如说“物价涨是由于通货澎涨的关系”。这种说法有时会发生含混，譬如说“由于年龄关系，他不能参加游行”，“他”可能是五六岁的小孩子，也可能是七八十岁的老年人。这句话只有对知道“他”是谁的人说，才不会引起误解。如果说“由于年龄太小（或太大）”，意思就明确了。再举些例子来看：
    （十一）有些妇女因条件关系，报名未被录取而伤心痛哭。（期）
    （十二）在北京还没有解放以前，因为环境和生活关系，和一个有钱的男人结了婚。（期）
    （十一）的“条件关系”意思很含胡，何不说“条件不合”？（十二）可说“因为环境不好和生活困苦”。
    （十三）但终因校方经济困难关系，无法具体解决。（期）
    （十四）由于人民志愿军严格执行“三大纪律、八项注意”的关系，南朝鲜人民以前听到的关于志愿军的谣言都不攻自破了。（期）
    这两个“关系”都没有必要，应删。
    过程。“过程”跟“时期”或“期间”不同：前者指一件事情从头到尾的经过，后者仅指时间。因此“抗日战争的过程”和“抗日战争期间”意义完全不同。下面是一些混用的例子：
    （十五）在他担任校长的过程中……（作）
    （十六）我是一个失业者，在一年半以前到现在就没找到一点职业，在这过程中，生活的艰苦当然可以想见。（信）
    这两个例子都应该用“期间”。（后一例太啰苏，“一点职业”也不妥，不如改为“一年半以来，一直没有找到职业”。）
    （十七）经过一个过程的试验，我们觉得这个制度的规定对工作上的推动帮助很大。（期）
    （十八）以后又经过一些痛苦的过程，我的学习态度大大的转变了。（作）
    （十九）在翻译工作的过程中，究竟用哪一类话来翻译这段文字，你得下一番工夫去了解。（期）
    前两个例子都应改为“时期”。（又我们不说“一个过程”，更不说“一些过程”，只说“一段过程”“一个时期”。）（十九）如果说“翻译的时候”，要简单清楚得多。（又“了解”不妥，应改“研究”。）
    搞。“搞”是从西南区方言里吸收来的一个词。原来的意思相当于“做”或“弄”。现在势力越来越大，可以代替很多动词用。例如“搞工作”（做工作），“搞糟了”（弄糟了），“搞恋爱”（谈恋爱），“搞工程的”（学工程的），“每人搞一篇”（每人写一篇）……等等。这个词虽然“变化无穷”，但也不是绝对“无往而不利”的，例如：
    （二十）我妻现在在此搞小学教员工作。（信）
    （二一）土改工作结束的时候，开始搞恶霸。（稿）
    （二二）内部不团结，互相搞成见。（期）
    （二十）说“当小学教员”，岂不简单？（二一）不如说“斗恶霸”。（二二）应说“闹意见”。
    掌握。“掌握”是“把握”和“控制”的意思，例如说“掌握全部情况”“掌握时间”。下面例句里用得不对：
    （二三）迅速的成立了学习小组，每天掌握大家上大课。（期）
    （二四）开代表会议时，对大会上的游艺节目，事先掌握不够。（期）
    （二五）一般性的公文由秘书室文书科管存，特殊性的由各部门自行掌握。（期）
    （二三）的“掌握”太含胡，不知所指。（二四）恐怕是说“准备不够”。（二五）应说“保管”。（又“管存”是杜撰的。）
    引起。“我注意这件事”这个意思，可以有四种不同的表达方式：（甲）我注意这件事；（乙）我对于这件事注意；（丙）这件事使我注意；（丁）这件事引起我的注意。
    （甲）（乙）是一组，主语是“我”（主动者）。（丙）（丁）是一组，主语是“这件事”（被动者）。这两组的意思不完全相同。（甲）（乙）一组着重主动者“我”，“我”主动地去注意“这件事”；（丙）（丁）一组着重被动者“这件事”，“这件事”相当特殊，我不得不注意。现在常把（乙）和（丁）糅合起来，说成：（戊）我对于这件事引起了注意。这个说法是不好的，理由有二。第一，在逻辑上说不通，因为“引起注意”的是“事”，不是“我”，“我”不能“引起”自己的“注意”。第二，这是五种说法里最噜苏的一种。
    （二六）干部……对这种不合理的生产制度从未引起注意，使生产遭受到重大损失。（报）
    （二七）照目前风气说来，文学理论家、批评家、及大多数读者，对于这种作品是极容易引起不愉快的感情的。（期）
    （二六）有（乙）（丁）两种改法：或是说“对于这种不合理的生产制度，干部从来没有注意”，或是说“这种不合理的生产制度从来没有引起干部的注意”。（二七）只能用（丁）种改法：“这种作品是极容易引起文学理论家，批评家及大多数读者的不愉快的感情的”。
    遭受、受到、遭遇。“遭受”比“受到”的范围窄一点，只能用于不幸或不利的事。不过这两个词有一点是相同的，后面只能跟及物动词，例如：
    （二八）慰问团受到朝鲜人民热烈的欢迎。（报）
    （二九）美帝国主义遭受严重打击。（报）
    “遭遇”往往与名词连用，如说“遭遇困难”，“遭遇敌人”。下面三句就不对了：
    （三十）一九五○年一至三月期间，由于市场虚假购买力消失，北京工商界曾经和全国工商界一样遭受过困难。（期）
    （三一）那时如果不参加国民党，就会遭受失业。（稿）
    （三二）春节里，也受到杭州当地的拜年队去给她贺年，称她为光荣的母亲。（期）
    “困难”是名词，“失业”是不及物动词，不能与“遭受”连用。（三十）的“遭受”应改为“遭遇”或“遇到”。（三一）应说“……就会失业”。（三二）的错误是在“受到”后面加上了一个句子形式。应该删去“受到”，直捷了当就说“杭州当地的拜年队也去给她贺年”。
    值得。“值得”的主体和客体常常被人弄颠倒，例如：
    （三三）这是一种可喜的现象，每个青年值得欢欣的。（期）
    （三四）该公司成立未久，即有此优良成绩，社会各界值得予以注意。（报）
    （三三）值得欢欣的不是“每个青年”，而是“可喜的现象”，应说“值得每个青年欢欣”。（三四）值得注意的也不是“社会各界”，而是“优良成绩”，应说“值得社会各界注意”。
    （三五）人民时代的新艺术，是值得从这个伟大宝贵遗产中来好好学习。（件）
    这是把“值得”与“应该”弄混了。并且，“艺术”自己是不会学习的，应改为“人民时代的新艺术工作者，应该向这个伟大宝贵的遗产好好学习”。如果保留“值得”，则可以改为“这个伟大宝贵的遗产是值得人民时代的新艺术工作者好好学习的”。
    存在。“存在”是不及物动词，它的主语可以在前，例如：
    （三六）这种主观主义的作风，不是还在许多同志中间存在着吗？（毛）也可以在后（比较第一讲第四段十、十一例），例如：
    （三七）在一部分同志中，是确实存在着这种倾向的。（毛）
    （三八）但是确实存在这种典型，而且是相当多。（毛）
    “存在”跟“有”的意思很相近，如（三七）（三八）两例的“存在”就可以改用“有”，但是这两句的“有”是无主语的动词（比较第一讲第四段例二），在它后面的是宾语，而“存在”之后是它的主语。有主语的“有”（表示领属关系），就不能改成“存在”。“我有一本书”，不能说“我存在一本书”；“中国有五千年的历史”，也不能说“中国存在着五千年的历史”。
    （三九）渐渐感到我存在着许多缺点。（信）
    （四十）华北各地普遍的存在着宋辽金元明清各代的释道庙观。（期）
    （三九）的“存在着”应改为“有”。（四十）应说“华北到处都有……”。
    （四一）杨同志存在着的思想问题的确是很严重的。（期）
    （四二）但是从另外一方面看来，弱点还是存在得很多的。（稿）
    这两个“存在”毫无用处，应删。
    基本上。如果说“全中国基本上已经解放了”，意思是说：除了少数地区之外，大部分地区已经解放了。如果说“中国基本上是一个农业国”，意思是说：中国主要依靠农业生产（虽然也有些工业，但是比重很小）。可见说某事某物“基本上”怎么样，等于说它“本质上”怎么样。我们用这个词是为了使说话更严密，更准确。如果马虎一点，上面两句话的“基本上”都可以省去，说“全中国已经解放了”，“中国是一个农业国”。近来这个词用得太滥，意义很含胡，丧失了原有的严密性与准确性。例如：
    （四三）本厂的宣传鼓动工作，基本上是有一些成绩的。（稿）
    （四四）遭遇到若干基本上的困难。（期）
    （四三）如果真是“基本上”有成绩，那就决不止“一些”；如果只有“一些”成绩，就不能说“基本上”。（四四）的“基本上”用得太含胡；不知是说“遭遇到根本困难”，还是说“遭遇到若干困难”。
    一定。“一定”跟“特定”的意思一样。例如：
    （四五）一切文化或文艺都是属于一定的阶级，一定的党，即一定的政治路线的。（毛）
    （四六）一定集团的人们，长期站在一定的阶级地位，即站在一定的社会生产地位，以一定的方式，长期的生产着，生活着与斗争着。（刘少奇）
    现在往往把它用来表示“相当”的意思。例如：
    （四七）他这样做自然不正确，不过也是有一定的理由的。（期）
    （四八）这个问题是有一定的典型性的，可能有很多读者参加讨论。（期）
    “一定”和“相当”的意义确有相似之处，只是轻重不同。譬如我们说“他这样做是有一定的理由的”，这句话的意思是肯定的，等于说“他这样做是有理由的”。如果说“他这样做是有相当理由的”，就不是完全肯定了，只是说：多少有点理由。（四七）前面已肯定地说“这样做不正确”，下面就只能用“相当”，不能用“一定”。（四八）例太绕湾儿，普通只说“这个问题是相当典型的”。
    （四九）他在一定的时期内，也表现得不错。（期）
    何不说“他有些时候，也表现得不错”？
    （五十）这种思想的形成是有它一定的历史根源的。（期）
    “一定的历史根源”已经成了套语了。其实这个“一定的”是多余的，没有它意思也同样清楚。
