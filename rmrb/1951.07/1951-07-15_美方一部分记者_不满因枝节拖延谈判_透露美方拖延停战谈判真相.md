Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: Some journalists interviewing within the United Nations forces continue to express dissatisfaction with the United Nations representatives’ suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations under the pretext of the journalist issue. Associated Press reporter Baker cabled on the 13th that “some people in the press think that journalists have become scapegoats for the clumsy propaganda of the United Nations, and some people think that the press corps has discredited itself in this whole matter.” “Some reporters said they would write to the United Nations Command, requesting that they withdraw their request to go to Kaesong, if this request would interrupt the peace talks.” CBS reporter Pierpoint said: "I am not proud to be a member of the press corps, because they have not done well in this whole matter. I believe that many subjective reports have been sent from here. I am not proud to be associated with a group of people who may prolong the war by one more day." Saturday Evening Post reporter Atkins said: "I think it is a mistake for the military authorities to push the responsibility for continuing negotiations onto such a trivial matter." The agency quoted Chicago Tribune reporter Vost on the 12th as saying: "This damn note (note: referring to the letter from UN Chief Delegate Joye to General Nam Il on the 12th) interrupted the conference for this trivial matter… Everyone is flustered and impatient about this issue. Some more American children will die because of this.”

Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: TASS News Agency, New York, July 13th: A CBS reporter in Washington said on the 12th: U.S. officials deliberately sent a group of reporters to Kaesong, anticipating that these reporters would be turned away. Because, due to domestic political problems, they wanted to find an excuse to temporarily suspend the armistice conference.

The reporter pointed out: Congress is now slow to take action on the government's proposed economic "control" bill related to the rearmament plan. Senior officials want to imply that the Korean armistice talks may fail, in an attempt to prompt Congress to support the continued rearmament plan.

    不满因枝节拖延谈判
    透露美方拖延停战谈判真相
    【新华社十四日讯】在联合国军中采访的一部分记者，继续对联合国军代表借口记者问题中止朝鲜停战谈判表示不满。美联社记者贝克尔十三日电称记者中“有人认为记者成了代联合国的拙劣宣传受过的牺牲品，有人认为记者团在整个这个问题上把自己弄得声名扫地。”“有些记者说要写信给联合国军司令部，请求撤消他们到开城去的要求，如果这种要求会使和谈中断的话。”哥伦比亚广播系统记者皮尔旁特说：“我并不因为做记者团团员而感到骄傲，因为他们在整个这个问题上做得不好。我相信许多不客观的报道是从这里发出去的。我并不因为与可能使战争多延长一天的一伙人有联系而感到骄傲。”星期六晚邮报记者阿特金斯说：“我认为军事当局把继续谈判的责任推到这样一件小事上面是一种错误。”该社十二日电引芝加哥论坛报记者伏斯特的话说：“这个该死的照会（按：指联合国军首席代表乔埃十二日致南日将军函）为了这一点鸡毛蒜皮的事就使和会中断了……每一个人对这个问题都是慌慌张张，沉不住气。又有一些美国孩子会因此丧命。”
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：哥伦比亚广播公司驻华盛顿记者十二日说：美国官员们是故意派遣一群记者到开城去的，他们预料到这些记者会被挡驾。因为，由于国内的政治问题，他们要找寻一个借口暂时中止休战会议。
    这位记者指出：国会现在对于政府提出的与重整军备计划有关的经济“管制”的法案，迟迟不采取行动。高级官员们想暗示朝鲜休战会谈有可能失败，企图借此促使国会支持继续进行整顿军备计划。
