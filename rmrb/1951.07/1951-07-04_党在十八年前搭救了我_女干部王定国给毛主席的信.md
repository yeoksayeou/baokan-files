　　The Party Rescued Me Eighteen Years Ago
    ——A Letter from Female Cadre Wang Dingguo to Chairman Mao

    Chairman Mao:

    February 1933, a sunny and peaceful spring day, is a day I will never forget.

    I was originally a girl from a poor family. We had no land, no house, and my father was chronically ill and unable to work. From a young age, I gathered firewood, sweet potato roots, and wild vegetables to help my mother grind flour for others and do odd jobs to earn a living. There were seven siblings in my family, three of whom starved to death, and one was sold after my father died.

    I married at the age of nineteen, but was soon sold by my husband's family to a place far away from home that I was extremely unwilling to go to. I hated it and ran away back home. Within a few days, the buyer tracked me down. The hooligans and gentry on the street were eager for this to happen, and were negotiating with the buyer, trying to profit from it. Although I had the determination to resist, what could I do?

    Oh, Chairman Mao! In the old society, who would rescue a lonely and helpless girl?

    Just then—in February 1933—I heard that the Red Army was coming soon, disrupting their deal. It was at this time that I determined my revolutionary path, forever breaking free from the clutches of the devil and joining the Red Army. Before this, a few people often came to my house to play, telling me the reasons why women should cut their hair, unbind their feet, and join the peasant association. They often asked me to deliver letters for them, sometimes at night, and asked me to hide things. I couldn't read and didn't know what they were. I just thought they were good people and was happy to help them. When I joined the Red Army and saw that they were all there, I realized that they were all underground workers.

    From then on, I lived a free and happy life. I participated in drama troupes, worked in cooperatives, did women's work, fought in battles, participated in the Great Production Campaign, and participated in the Long March. The education and training given to me by the Party completely transformed me into a new person. When I think of the life of suffering I endured in the past, I cannot help but be grateful to the Party for nurturing me. I had never been to school before, but now I have no great difficulty in reading books and newspapers, and I can even write short articles. This is entirely due to the education and cultivation of the Party.

    Now I feel very happy in my work and study. However, my knowledge and abilities are still far from the requirements of the Party and the people. In the future, I guarantee that I will work hard to improve my culture, study my profession, and complete all the tasks assigned to me by the Party.

      Wishing you good health!
                  Wang Dingguo, Staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs

　　党在十八年前搭救了我
    ——女干部王定国给毛主席的信毛主席：
    一九三三年二月一个晴和的春天，是我最难忘记的一天。
    我原是一个贫苦家中的女子。无土地，无房屋，父亲长年有病不能劳动。我从小就拾柴，拾红薯根，采野菜，帮助母亲替人推磨、做零活赚饭吃。兄弟姊妹七人，饿死三个，父亲死后卖掉一个。
    我十九岁出嫁了，不久被婆家卖到我极不愿去的离家很远的地方。我恨极了，偷跑回家。不几天买主跟踪追寻到了，街上的流氓劣绅巴不得有这事，正在做好做歹的和买主讲盘子，想从中取利。我虽有反抗的决心，但有什么办法呢？
    毛主席呵！在旧社会谁来打救一个孤苦无告的女孩子呵！
    正在那时候——一九三三年二月，听说红军快到了，冲散了他们的买卖。我也就在这时候确定了我的革命道路，永远挣脱魔鬼的手，参加了红军。在这以前，有几个人常到我家来玩，向我讲女子剪发放足、参加农民协会的道理，又常要我替他们送信，有时是晚上送；要我收藏东西。我不识字，也不知是什么。我只认为他们是好人，很乐意帮助他们。及至我参加了红军，看到他们都在那里，才知道他们原来都是地下工作者。
    从此以后，我过着自由幸福的生活。我参加过剧团，做过合作社的工作，做过妇女工作，也打过仗，参加过大生产，参加过长征，党给我的教育和锻炼，使我完全变成一个新人。一想到我过去受熬煎的生活，就使我不能不感激党对我的抚养。我过去没念过书，现在我看书读报已没有多大的困难，而且还可以写成较短的文章，这完全是由于党的教育和培养的结果。
    现在我在工作和学习中，感觉非常愉快。但是我的知识能力还与党及人民的要求差得很远，今后我保证要努力提高文化，钻研业务，完成党交给我的一切任务。
      祝您身体健康！
                  内务部工作人员  王定国
