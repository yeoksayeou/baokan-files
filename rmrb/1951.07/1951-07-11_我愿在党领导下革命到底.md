I am willing to carry the revolution through to the end under the leadership of the Party
(Su Guangfu, an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike)

I am an old worker who has worked in the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau for many years. I participated in the "February 7th" strike under the leadership of the Communist Party. In February 1950, at the People's Representative Conference in Zhengzhou, I was elected as a member of the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government and served as the Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau. I feel extremely honored and deeply grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao!

Since the day it was founded, the Chinese Communist Party has always led the Chinese people in a resolute struggle against the imperialists and feudal warlords who oppressed the Chinese people. In 1921, I secretly organized a trade union under the leadership of the Party. At that time, China's feudal rulers did not allow workers to form trade unions, so we workers in Zhengzhou organized workers under the name of "Workers' Club." In 1922, the Zhengzhou Trade Union Preparatory Committee was officially established. By 1923, trade unions or trade union preparatory committees had been established along the Beijing-Hankou Railway line. At this time, the Party led us to prepare for the establishment of the All-Beijing-Hankou Railway General Trade Union and decided to hold the inaugural meeting of the All-Railway General Trade Union in Zhengzhou on February 1st.

At that time, I was the General Affairs Director of the General Trade Union Preparatory Committee. I sent out 270 letters, inviting representatives and guests from various places to Zhengzhou for the meeting. Representatives from various places arrived on January 28th. On the 29th, we sent representatives to Luoyang to negotiate with the warlord Wu Peifu. The Wu bandit was unreasonable and did not allow us to establish a general trade union; he also attempted to use money to buy off and divide the workers. The representatives were very angry, and on the 30th, everyone rushed back to Zhengzhou. At three o'clock on the night of the 31st, after a heated discussion among the representatives, it was finally decided: no matter what the sacrifice, the meeting must be held tomorrow.

On February 1st, we proceeded according to the scheduled steps. At 9:00 a.m., representatives from various places gathered at the station, and members of the Zhengzhou Trade Union also participated in formation. The majestic team was led by a large flag, carrying a large plaque engraved with the four characters "Labor Sacred," and a military band led the way. Our workers' team set off. The team passed through Zhengzhou's most prosperous street, Datong Road, and headed towards the meeting venue. However, the feudal warlord Wu Peifu had already issued orders to deploy military police to disrupt us. When the team was about to reach the venue, the reactionary military police disrupted our team. Everyone bravely broke through the encirclement of the military police and ran to the venue to announce the opening of the meeting. At that time, Huang Dianchen, the pseudo police chief of Zhengzhou, ran to the venue to speak to everyone, forbidding the meeting from being held. We ignored him and ordered the military band to play loudly, drowning out his voice. We officially opened the meeting and announced the establishment of the General Trade Union. The reactionary military police further viciously destroyed the venue, making it impossible for the meeting to continue. Everyone had to break through the machine gun encirclement and secretly held a meeting in the hotel, deciding that the meeting would be temporarily suspended and the General Trade Union would move to Hankou. The conference also put forward conditions to the reactionary warlord Wu Peifu, demanding that he compensate the trade union for its losses and severely punish Zhao Jixian, the head of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau who oppressed workers and hindered the establishment of trade unions (the criminal Zhao Jixian has now been arrested by the People's Government in Suzhou), and limited him to reply before February 4th; if he did not reply, the entire railway would go on strike.

On the afternoon of the 4th, the warlords did not reply. The entire Beijing-Hankou Railway began a major strike. On the 5th, the warlords arrested Gao Bin, Jiang Haishi, Qian Rengui, Wang Zongpei, and Liu Yuansong, the heads of the Zhengzhou Trade Union. They put iron chains around their necks and legs, and sent the five people to the train, refusing to let them eat the food or wear the clothes that were sent. At that time, the reactionary warlord Jin Yunpeng asked the workers: "Why don't you resume work?" We said: "We will never resume work unless the General Trade Union gives the order." The Jin bandit said: "I kill dozens of people every day. If you don't resume work, be careful for your lives!" We said: "We won't resume work even if we are killed!" On the 7th, the reactionary rulers at that time arrested workers everywhere, forcing them to resume work. Wu Peifu ordered the killing of workers in Hankou, Changxindian, Zhengzhou and other places.

After this struggle, we more clearly recognized the enemy's ferocity and brutality, we hated the enemy even more; our fighting will became stronger, and we had more cadres engaged in the workers' movement. We continued to secretly organize trade unions. In 1926, the warlord Wu Peifu again arrested our trade union cadres Wang Shengyou and Si Wenfa, and after killing them, hung their heads on the telephone poles on Dehua Street in Zhengzhou. When I heard this news, I couldn't wait to catch those executioners immediately and smash them with a hammer.

The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led the Chinese people through countless hardships and bloody struggles, and we Chinese people have won and turned over. Looking back on the past struggles, our victory was so hard-won! We must cherish the fruits of victory and defend our new China.

### 我愿在党领导下革命到底

　　我愿在党领导下革命到底
    （参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人苏广福）
    我是一个在京汉路局作工多年的老工人，曾在共产党的领导下，参加过“二七”大罢工的斗争。在一九五○年二月郑州市召开的各界人民代表会议上，我被选为郑州市人民政府委员，并担任了劳动局副局长的职务。我感到无上的光荣，并深深感谢党和毛主席！
    中国共产党自成立那一天起，就一直是领导中国人民向压在中国人民头上的帝国主义和封建军阀进行坚决的斗争的。一九二一年，我曾在党的领导下，秘密组织工会。那时中国的封建统治者是不许工人成立工会的，我们郑州的工人就用“工人俱乐部”的名义组织工人。一九二二年，才正式成立了郑州的工会筹备会。到一九二三年，京汉铁路沿线都相继成立了工会或工会的筹备会了，这时，党就领导我们准备成立全京汉路总工会，并决定二月一日在郑州召开全路总工会成立大会。
    那时我是总工会的筹备会庶务主任。经我手发出了二百七十封信，请各地代表和来宾到郑州开会。各地代表元月二十八日到齐。二十九日，我们就派代表至洛阳和军阀吴佩孚谈判。吴匪蛮不讲理，不准我们成立总工会；他并企图用金钱收买和分化工人。代表们十分气愤，三十日大家即赶回郑州。在三十一日夜里三点钟，经过代表们热烈的讨论，最后决定：任凭怎样牺牲，明日一定开会。
    二月一日，我们就按着预定的步骤进行。上午九时，各地代表都齐集在车站，郑州的工会会员也都整队参加，雄壮的队伍前面打着大旗，抬着刻制“劳工神圣”四字的大匾，还有军乐队开道。我们工人的队伍出发了。队伍经过郑州最繁华的大街——大同路，走向大会会场。那知封建军阀吴佩孚早已下命令布置了军警，要和我们捣乱。当队伍快到会场的时候，反动军警冲乱了我们的队伍，我们大家奋勇冲过军警的包围，跑到会场宣布开会。当时有郑州伪警察局长黄殿臣跑到会场向大家讲话，不许开会。我们不听，叫军乐队大吹大打，压下他的声音。我们正式开会，并宣布了总工会的成立。反动军警又进一步凶恶地捣毁会场，使会议无法进行。大家只好冲出机关枪重围，在旅馆里秘密地开了一个会，决定大会暂时停开，总工会迁往汉口。大会并向反动军阀吴佩孚提出条件，要他赔偿工会的损失，并严惩压迫工人、阻碍工人成立工会的京汉铁路局长赵继贤（赵犯继贤现已在苏州被人民政府逮捕），限他在二月四日前答复；如不答复，全路就要罢工。
    四号下午军阀们没有答复。京汉铁路全路即开始大罢工。五号那天，军阀们就把郑州工会负责人高斌、姜海士、钱仁贵、王宗培、刘元松等五人捕去，脖子上拴着铁链子，腿上也拴着铁链子，将五人送到火车上，送饭不叫吃，送衣不叫穿。当时反动军阀靳云鹏问工人：“你们为什么不开工？”我们说：“总工会不下命令我们决不开工。”靳匪说：“我每天都要杀几十人，不开工小心你们的性命！”我们说：“杀了也不开工！”七号那天，当时反动的统治者到处抓工人，强迫工人复工，吴佩孚下令在汉口、长辛店、郑州等地，开始杀工人。
    经过这次斗争，我们更加认清了敌人的凶恶残暴，我们更加仇恨敌人；我们的斗争意志更加坚强了，我们进行工人运动的干部更多了。我们继续秘密地组织工会。在一九二六年军阀吴佩孚又抓去了我们工会干部汪胜有、司文法，将他们屠杀后把头挂在郑州德化街的电线杆上。我听到了这个消息，恨不得立刻抓到那些刽子手们，把他们用铁锤捣碎。
    共产党毛主席领导中国人民，经过千辛万苦和无数次的流血斗争，咱们中国人民胜利了，翻身了。回想到过去的斗争，咱们的胜利是多么不容易啊！咱们要好好保卫胜利的果实，保卫咱们的新中国。
