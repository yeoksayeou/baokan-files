　　At the Nanjing Municipal People's Representative Conference for Resisting America and Aiding Korea held on the 28th and 29th of last month, Catholics Sun Chifang and Cheng Shuxiu, among others, exposed Libri's continued reactionary behavior of intimidating Chinese Catholics. On June 3rd, Libri instructed his lackeys to intimidate churchgoers during Mass, saying, "Signing against 'Envoy Libri' is apostasy and will lead to the eighteenth level of hell." On the morning of June 4th, Libri sent his secretary, Belgian priest Weng Wanda, to find Li Weiguang, the acting bishop of the Nanjing Diocese, saying he would "remove Li Weiguang's divine authority." On June 5th, Libri again instructed his lackeys to spread rumors that "the government is going to arrest those who oppose signing," attempting to sow discord between patriotic Catholics and the government. After all these threats, intimidations, and slanderous rogue tactics failed, Libri then had his servants spread lies such as "Libri is determined to help the Chinese Church carry out the Three-Self Patriotic Movement" and "He can order the replacement of all foreign bishops with Chinese bishops," attempting to divide the unity of patriotic Catholics. After Sun Chifang and others exposed Libri's new conspiracy, all the representatives present further recognized the insidiousness and cunning of the imperialist elements. In a state of indignation, all representatives unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the People's Government promptly expel Libri from China. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

　　Under the driving influence of the nationwide patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, 793 Catholics in the Nanjing Diocese jointly issued a declaration on March 31st this year, stating their political stance: opposing imperialist use of Catholicism for aggressive conspiracies, supporting resistance against America and aid to Korea, opposing the United States' separate peace treaty with Japan and the arming of Japan, advocating active actions to implement the three principles of self-support, self-propagation, and self-governance for Catholicism in China, opposing Vatican interference in China's internal affairs, and resolutely severing political and economic ties with it. Unexpectedly, this patriotic, moderate, and reasonable declaration angered Libri, a Monaco national and running dog of American imperialism who remained in this city. He immediately wrote to Catholic bishops across the country, expressing that he "cannot agree" with the patriotic actions of Nanjing Catholics, slandering the just actions of the Chinese people as "the enemy's tricks," openly referring to the Chinese people, including patriotic Catholics, and the People's Government as "enemies," and妄想 (wàngxiǎng - vainly hoping/attempting) to mobilize the Catholic "all the faithful" and "the entire clergy" to defeat the great Chinese people and the People's Government. Libri's letter is ironclad proof of imperialism's use of Catholicism to invade China, and ironclad proof of the Roman Curia's interference in China's internal affairs. This letter also fully exposes the sinister face of the imperialist element Libri.

　　After Libri's conspiracy to sabotage the Chinese Catholic patriotic movement was exposed, people across the country rose up in protest, expressing that they would never tolerate it. 758 patriotic Catholics in this city also issued a declaration a few days ago, demanding that the government expel Libri. When patriotic Catholics launched this signature campaign, Libri and his lackeys still tried to salvage their failure, resorting to even more despicable and insidious means to obstruct the patriotic actions of the Catholics, using all means of threat and sabotage, using so-called "divine authority" and "dogma" as his weapons, intimidating Catholics that signing against Libri was "treason," "a crime," and would lead "to the eighteenth level of hell," and that they could not "perform divine service." However, the deception and intimidation of the imperialist elements could not scare or deceive patriotic Catholics. The anti-imperialist patriotic movement of Nanjing Catholics is still expanding day by day.

　　We, the entire representatives of the Nanjing Municipal Conference of Representatives for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, believe that from the facts of Libri's consistent antagonism towards the Chinese people in the past, it also proves that Libri is an enemy of our Chinese people. Today, in the face of the massive patriotic movement of the Chinese people resisting America and aiding Korea, he still wants to ride on the heads of the Chinese people, act as a tyrant, issue orders, slander our great motherland and people, and interfere in our internal affairs. The Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate this imperialist element continuing to remain on our sacred land. We demand that the government expel Libri from the country forever.

### 南京人民抗美援朝代表会议通过决议  要求把帝国主义分子黎培里逐出国境

　　南京人民抗美援朝代表会议通过决议
    要求把帝国主义分子黎培里逐出国境
    在上月二十八、二十九两日举行的南京市各界人民抗美援朝代表会议上，天主教徒孙持芳、程树秀等揭发了黎培里继续威吓中国天主教徒的反动行为。六月三日，黎培里曾指使他的走狗在做弥撒时，对教徒进行恫吓，说：“签名反对‘黎公使’是背教的，要下十八层地狱。”六月四日上午，黎培里派他的秘书比籍神父翁万达去找南京教区代理主教李维光，说对李维光要“摘神权”。六月五日，黎培里又指使他的走狗造谣说“政府要逮捕反对签名的人”，企图挑拨爱国教徒与政府之间的团结。当这一切恐吓威胁、造谣中伤的流氓手段都失败以后，黎培里又叫他的仆从散布什么“黎培里决心帮助中国教会开展三自运动”，“他可以下令把全部外国主教撤换成中国主教”等鬼话，企图分化爱国教徒的团结。孙持芳等揭发了黎培里的上述新阴谋后，到会的全体代表进一步认识了帝国主义分子的阴险和狡猾。全体代表在激愤的情绪中一致通过了一项决议，要求人民政府迅速将黎培里逐出中国。决议全文如下：
    在全国抗美援朝爱国运动的推动影响之下，天主教南京教区七百九十三个教徒曾于今年三月三十一日联合发表宣言，表明了他们的政治主张：反对帝国主义利用天主教进行侵略阴谋，赞成抗美援朝，反对美国单独对日媾和与武装日本，主张积极行动起来，实行天主教在中国自养、自传、自治三大原则，反对教廷干涉中国内政，坚决与它割断政治上和经济上的关系。谁知这个爱国的温和合理的宣言，竟触怒了留在本市的美帝国主义走狗摩纳哥侨民黎培里。他当天就写信给全国各地的天主教主教们，表示对于南京天主教徒的爱国行动“不能赞同”，污蔑中国人民的正义行动为“敌人的诡计”，公然指称包括爱国天主教徒在内的中国人民和人民政府为“敌人”，并妄想动员天主教的“一切教友们”和“全体神职班”来战胜伟大的中国人民和人民政府。黎培里的信是帝国主义利用天主教侵略中国的铁证，是罗马教廷干涉中国内政的铁证。这封信也充分暴露了帝国主义分子黎培里的狰狞面目。
    黎培里破坏中国天主教爱国运动的阴谋被揭发后，全国人民纷起抗议，表示决不能容忍，本市爱国天主教徒七百五十八人也于日前发表了宣言，要求政府驱逐黎培里。当爱国教徒发起这一签名时，黎培里及其走狗仍图挽救他们的失败，竟以更卑鄙阴险的手段阻挠教徒的爱国行动，百般威胁破坏，以所谓“神权”与“教义”作为他的武器，恐吓教徒签名反对黎培里就是“叛徒”、“犯罪”，“要下十八层地狱”，便不能“办神功”。但帝国主义分子的欺骗恫吓，吓不倒也骗不了爱国的天主教徒，南京天主教徒的反帝爱国运动仍在日益扩大。
    我们南京市抗美援朝代表会全体代表认为从黎培里过去一贯与中国人民为敌的事实中，也证明黎培里是我们中国人民的敌人。今天，在全中国人民巨大的抗美援朝爱国运动前面，他居然还想骑在中国人民头上，作威作福，发号施令，污蔑我们的伟大祖国和人民，干涉我国内政。站起来了的中国人民决不能容忍这个帝国主义分子再继续留在我们神圣的国土上，我们要求政府将黎培里永远驱逐出国境。
