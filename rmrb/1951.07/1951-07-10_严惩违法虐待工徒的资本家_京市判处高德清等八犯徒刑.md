　　Severely Punish Capitalists Who Illegally Abuse Apprentices
    Beijing Sentences Gao Deqing and Eight Others to Imprisonment
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Recently, a number of criminal acts of capitalists abusing apprentices and interfering with apprentices' participation in political activities have occurred in this city. Such barbaric feudal oppression has angered the broad masses of workers. They have called on the People's Government to protect the interests of workers and severely punish illegal capitalists. General industrialists and businessmen also requested the People's Government to punish these lawbreakers in industry and commerce according to law. The Beijing People's Court accepted the just demands of the masses and, on the 4th of this month, sentenced eight barbaric capitalists, including Gao Deqing, who abused apprentices and violated human rights, to fixed-term imprisonment. Among them, Gao Deqing was sentenced to four years of fixed-term imprisonment, Wang Baoshan to three years, Fu Bingwen and Jiao Yongliang to two years each, Zhang Derui to one year and six months, Li Liansheng and Guan Xueming to six months each, and Ru Xiuzhen to six months with a one-year reprieve. More than 140 workers and more than 300 industrialists and businessmen attended the sentencing as observers.
    When trying these cases, the Beijing People's Court invited relevant departments such as the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Labor Bureau, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau to participate in the trial and extensively exchanged opinions. Everyone agreed that such behavior is absolutely not allowed in a new democratic society, and the government should severely sanction it and strengthen education for the capitalists to rectify labor-capital relations and improve production.
    After the sentencing, Zhang Chunjiu of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Zhang Xianting of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, who served as jurors, made speeches expressing their support for the court's verdict. Workers and industrialists and businessmen in the audience also spoke enthusiastically, expressing their support. Among them, Liu Qin, an apprentice from Gaosheng Barber Shop who was beaten, said gratefully: "The People's Government has avenged me. I will definitely study technology hard in the future and improve production under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital." Gong Tiepeng, chairman of the Barber Industry Association, said: "This judgment is fair and reasonable. It not only gives due punishment to the few capitalists who oppress apprentices, but also has great educational significance for the entire business community." (Wang Jing)

　　严惩违法虐待工徒的资本家
    京市判处高德清等八犯徒刑
    【京市新闻处讯】本市连续发生了一些资本家虐打工徒、干涉工徒参加政治活动的犯罪行为，这种野蛮的封建压迫行为，激怒了广大工人群众。他们纷纷要求人民政府保护工人利益，严惩违法的资本家。一般工商业者，也要求人民政府依法惩办这些工商业中的不法分子。北京市人民法院接受群众的正义要求，在本月四日，将虐打工徒、侵犯人权的野蛮资本家高德清等八名判处有期徒刑。其中高德清判处有期徒刑四年，王宝山判处有期徒刑三年，傅炳文、焦永良各判处有期徒刑二年，张德瑞判处有期徒刑一年六个月，李连生、管学明判处有期徒刑各六个月，茹秀珍判处有期徒刑六个月缓刑一年。宣判时，有工人一百四十多人、工商业者三百多人参加旁听。
    北京市人民法院在审理这些案件时，邀请了市总工会、工商联合会、劳动局、工商局等有关部门陪同审理，并广泛交换了意见。大家都认为：这种行为是新民主主义社会所绝不容许的，政府应严厉加以制裁，并须对资方加强教育，以端正劳资关系，搞好生产。
    宣判后，陪审员市总工会张春久、工商联合会张献庭都发言表示拥护法院的判决。旁听席上的工人和工商业者，也热烈地纷纷发言，表示拥护。其中高升理发馆被打的学徒刘勤非常感激地说：“人民政府给我出气了，今后我一定努力学习技术，在劳资两利的原则下，搞好生产。”理发业同业公会主任委员龚铁鹏说：“这个判决公平合理，这不但给少数压迫学徒的资方以应有的惩办，也对整个工商界有很大的教育意义。”	    （王敬）
