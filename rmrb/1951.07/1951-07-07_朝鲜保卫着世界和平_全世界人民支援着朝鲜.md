Korea Defends World Peace
The People of the World Support Korea
By Ji Xichen, Representative of the Chongqing Press Delegation to the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea

Today, all peace-loving people around the world are watching Korea with admiration, expectation, and concern. This is because every battle on the Korean battlefield is closely related to the happy lives of peace-loving people in every corner of the world.

The Korean people and soldiers are defending their motherland with blood and also defending the world. With the support of peace-loving people around the world, Korea is fighting not only for patriotism but also for internationalism! – During my time with the Korean people and soldiers, I deeply realized this.

	(I)

Please listen to the story and speech of Kim Wan-rong, a corporal from a certain division of the Korean People's Army:

"We understand why we are fighting. We are fighting for the revenge of the people of our motherland, and at the same time, we are fighting so that all mankind will no longer suffer the disasters caused by the aggressors that our people have suffered."

He is a young man from a working-class family, twenty-two years old, with a ruddy face, brave and strong. He then spoke in a low voice about a bloody memory:

On the evening of April 16th, he and a liaison officer went to collect grain near the front line. Suddenly, a torrential rain poured down, and they hurried to a village by the roadside to take shelter. But the houses had no roofs, only charred earth walls standing like tombstones in the ruins. He thought, "If we can't take shelter from the rain, at least we can take shelter from the wind!" So they went into a dilapidated house. The liaison officer saw a pile of grass in the corner and, regardless of whether the grass was dry or wet, grabbed a handful and covered his head. Who knew that what he grabbed was not grass, but a piece of a woman's blood-stained skirt. When he shone a flashlight on it, he saw an old woman and a girl lying in the bloody, messy grass. They were naked from the waist down, biting their lips, and their hands were raised hard in front of their chests, making a gesture of resistance and struggle. An American bayonet was still stuck in the girl's exposed abdomen...

"Standing beside that mother and daughter who were unyielding even in death, comrade, my anger surged, and I couldn't say a word for a long time." Kim Wan-rong said sadly and angrily: "At that time, I seemed to see thousands upon thousands of our compatriots being killed, and I heard the cries of mothers all over the world: Kill the invaders!"

"Later, I pulled out that blood-stained bayonet and took it to our platoon's position. When everyone passed it around, I said: 'Comrades! This bayonet has already killed our relatives, and it also wants to stab China, the Soviet Union, and the whole world. What do you say we should do?' The soldiers shouted in unison: 'For the motherland, for world peace, we will eliminate the invaders!' Comrade! Our soldiers fight the foreign invading bandits with this kind of hatred and thought, and consider it an honor and a pleasure to kill one more bandit in Korea, as it will add one more point of safety to the whole world! On the daytime of April 23rd, two companies of enemies attacked the hill defended by my platoon. On that high ground of less than 300 meters, the enemy attacked the foot of the mountain with seven tanks, bombarded the middle of the mountain with firepower averaging 500 shells every five minutes, and five enemy planes took turns bombing and strafing the top of the mountain. The foot of the mountain, the top of the mountain, the front of the mountain, and the back of the mountain were completely turned into a raging sea of ​​fire. Comrade, at that time, let alone grass and trees, even steel would be melted by the fire. However, the People's Army soldiers, who were stronger than steel, jumped out of the bomb craters when the enemy infantry gradually approached, shouted long live, and rushed towards the enemy. When one fell, another stepped on his blood and continued forward. In this way, we repeatedly repelled three enemy attacks and even counterattacked and captured two highlands at night. Our platoon eliminated sixty-five invaders and made our contribution to the people of the world."

Dear friends, the heroic Korean People's Army is thus realizing its solemn oath to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

	(II)

In the serious, arduous, and life-and-death struggle, the Koreans we see always have smiles on their faces and always look forward to the victorious tomorrow with hope. Some people say that resilience, tenacity, upwardness, and optimism are the characteristics of the Korean people, one of the reasons being that they feel everywhere that they are not fighting alone, but that people all over the world are standing behind them. Songs praising the just actions of the great Chinese People's Volunteers are widely circulated among the Korean people and soldiers.

One day, we were encamped in Goksan County and met Kim Chae-hwan, the wife of a soldier of the People's Army and a twenty-four-year-old female labor party member. She recounted how the Volunteers rescued a group of victims from the brink of death.

"After Li Seung-man's security forces captured us, they押到us into a cave. We were twenty members of the Women's Alliance, including six labor party members and eight family members of People's Army soldiers. In order to find out news about the People's Army and guerrillas from our mouths, the enemy used all kinds of torture – beating, pouring cold water, pulling hair...…. However, none of us opened our mouths. If we had to say something, it was just one sentence: 'You can beat me or kill me as you please, but whether I speak or not is up to me! You can beat me and kill me, but you must never make me betray my son and husband!' The enemy had no choice but to decide to shoot us at dark. When we knew that we were going to die, everyone put on white skirts, tied red ribbons, and bravely sang 'The Song of General Kim Il-sung', meaning: 'Great blizzard, tell him! Avenge us after we die!'"

"When we were escorted to the hillside, the bandits made us dig our own graves, intending to bury us alive. While we were digging, gunshots suddenly rang out from the top of the hill. At first, we thought the guerrillas had come to fight, but when we looked up, we saw the Chinese People's Volunteers with red trim on their uniforms! They immediately captured all the enemies. At that time, we really didn't know what to say. Everyone rushed up and hugged the Volunteer comrades like embracing relatives. I don't usually cry, but this time I burst into tears on the shoulders and arms of the Volunteer comrades.

"At that time, we pulled the Volunteer comrades and insisted on calling them home, even if it was just to drink a glass of water, eat a bite of food, or sit down for a while. But they were in a hurry to pursue the enemy and didn't stop for a moment before setting off again. They walked in front, and we followed behind, constantly shouting: '打布罗都，东木拉托！' (Comrades, march forward!) We kept sending them off until we couldn't see their figures before we came back."

	(III)

Amidst the rumbling of artillery fire, the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea arrived at the front line of the People's Army. This news immediately spread like wildfire through the positions.

Luo Baijun, a model battalion commander of a certain unit of the People's Army, pinned the souvenir badge of Chairman Mao, symbolizing lofty friendship and honor, and the Polish People's commemorative medal engraved with an axe and sickle, together with the National Flag Medal awarded to him by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on his chest. He said enthusiastically: "With Chairman Mao by our side, we will surely win; looking at him will immediately increase our courage."

The slogan "People of the world unite to eliminate the American aggressors" in the air-raid shelter became Luo Baijun's main topic. He said:

"We want to thank the aid of peace-loving people all over the world. Its power is so widespread and so strong. If you pay attention, you will see that today, apart from the support of our people, many of the things that our People's Army eats, uses, and wears come from our international friends. On the front lines, we can see color picture books published in Moscow; we can eat Polish and Romanian candies. Among the clothes we wear are fabrics and wool donated by the people of China, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia, fur from the Mongolian People's Republic, and leather boots from the Soviet Union and rubber shoes from China; in addition, there are medicines and bandages donated by the Hungarian people. Once, in a comfort bag sent by the Chinese people, in addition to receiving needle and thread, I also saw a photo of a female worker, with the words written on the back: 'I wish the soldiers defending peace, eternal health!' All this friendly assistance is an important source of our Korean people and soldiers' continuous victories." Finally, he said with radiance: "We are glorious people, defending the world on the front line against imperialism; at the same time, we are happy people, with people all over the world supporting Korea."

Dear friends, for the sake of world peace, for the sake of national security, for the sake of our descendants, let us support the heroic Korean people even more!

　　朝鲜保卫着世界和平
    全世界人民支援着朝鲜
    中国人民赴朝慰问团重庆新闻界代表  纪希晨
    今天，全世界爱好和平的人们，都以敬慕、期待、关怀的目光注视着朝鲜。这是因为朝鲜战场上的每个战斗，都与世界上各个角落里的和平人民的幸福生活息息相关。
    朝鲜军民浴血保卫着祖国，同时也在保卫着世界。朝鲜依靠着全世界和平人民的支援，不但是为爱国主义而战，同时也是为国际主义而战！——在和朝鲜军民相处的日子里，使我深深认识到这点。
        （一）
    请听一听朝鲜人民军某师一位下士金万荣的故事和发言吧：
    “我们懂得我们为什么作战。我们为祖国人民复仇而战，同时也在为全人类不再遭受像我国人民所受的侵略者所造成的灾难而作战。”
    他是一位出身产业工人的青年，现年二十二岁，脸孔红润，剽悍而强健。他接着用低沉的声调谈起一段血的记忆：
    四月十六号晚间，他和联络兵到战线附近征粮。中途忽然暴雨倾盆，他们急急摸向路边的一个村庄去避雨。但是房子都没有顶，只剩下焦黑的土墙墓碑似的屹立在废墟上。他想：“不能避雨、避避风也行啊！”于是他们走到一间破房里。联络兵看到墙角有一堆草，不管草是干是潮，抓起一把就往头顶上遮盖。那知他抓到的不是草，却是一块女人的血裙片。他用手电筒一照，只见有一个老太太和一个姑娘，躺在殷殷血色的乱草中。她们光着下身，咬着嘴唇，两只手使劲地举在胸前，作着抵抗、挣扎的姿态，一把美国刺刀还插在那姑娘的裸露着的小腹上面……
    “站在那临死不屈的母女旁边，同志，我怒火冲腾，很久说不出一句话来。”金万荣悲愤地说：“那时，我仿佛看见我们成千成万被杀害的同胞，听见全世界母亲们的呼喊：杀死侵略者！”
    “后来，我拔下那把凝着血的刺刀，把刺刀带到我们排的阵地上。当大家相互传看的时候，我说：‘同志们！这把刺刀已经杀死了我们的亲人，它还想刺向中国、苏联和全世界，你们说该怎么办？’战士们同声高喊：‘为了祖国，为了世界和平，我们消灭侵略者！’同志！我们战士就怀着这种仇恨和思想，去和外国侵略强盗作战，并认为能在朝鲜多打死一个强盗，全世界便会多增加一分安全，把它当作光荣！当作愉快！四月二十三日白天，有两个连的敌人向我排据守的山头进攻。在那不及三百米的高地上，敌人用七辆坦克攻击山脚，用平均五分钟发射五百发炮弹的火力排轰山半腰，山顶上则有五架敌机轮番轰炸扫射。山下、山上、山前、山后，完全变成熊熊火海。同志，那时节，不要说草木，就是钢铁也会被烈火融化的。可是，比钢铁还要刚强的人民军战士，当敌人步兵渐渐接近的时候，却从弹坑中跳起来，高呼着万岁，向敌人扑杀过去。一个躺下了，另一个又踏着他的血迹继续向前。我们就这样反复打退了敌人三次进攻，到夜间还反击夺下两个高地。我们一个排消灭了六十五个侵略者，为全世界人民作出了我们的贡献。”
    亲爱的朋友，英勇的朝鲜人民军，就是这样实现着他们保卫祖国，保卫世界和平的庄严誓言。
            （二）
    在严重的艰苦的生死斗争里，我们所看到的朝鲜人，总是面带微笑，永远满怀希望地瞻望着胜利的明天。有人说：刚毅、顽强、向上、乐观是朝鲜人民的特点，原因之一，就是因为他们处处感触到自己不是孤军作战，而是有全世界人民站在他们后面。在朝鲜军民中广泛流传着歌颂伟大中国人民志愿军的正义行动。
    有一天，我们宿营谷山郡，遇到一位人民军军人的妻子、二十四岁的女劳动党员金彩焕。她叙述了志愿军怎样从死亡的边沿拯救了一群被难者。
    “李承晚治安队把我们抓起后，将我们押到一个山洞里。我们是二十个女性同盟会员，其中六个是劳动党员，八个人民军军人的家属。为了从我们口中探听到人民军、游击队的消息，敌人用各种刑法——拷打、灌冷水、拔头发………。可是，我们谁都不开口，要说，就是一句话：“要打要杀由你，说不说由我！你可以打我杀我，可是决不能使我出卖自己的儿子与丈夫！”敌人没有办法，决定到天黑便把我们枪杀。当我们知道自己非死不可的时候，大家都提起白裙、结好红带，勇敢地唱着“金日成将军之歌”，意思是说：“大风雪啊，你告诉他啊！我们死后，给报仇呀！”
    “押到山坡下时，匪徒们让我们自己给自己挖土坑，打算活埋我们。我们正在挖的时候，枪声突然从山头上打响啦。开始还以为是游击队打来了，我们抬头一看，原来是衣服上缀有红边的中国人民志愿军啊！他们马上把敌人全数俘虏起来。那时候，我们真不知该说什么话，大伙一下像拥抱亲人那样，扑上去把志愿军同志抱起来。我本来不常流泪，这回也伏到志愿军同志的肩臂上呜呜大哭起来了。
    “当时，我们拉着志愿军同志，一定叫他们回家，那怕喝口水，吃口饭，坐一坐也好呀。可是他们急着追击敌人，一会也不停，便又上路了。他们走在前面，我们跟在后面，不住地高喊：“打布罗都，东木拉托！”（同志们，前进吧！）一直送到望不到人影才回来。”
            （三）
    隆隆炮声中，中国人民赴朝慰问团抵达人民军前线。这消息立刻像捷报似地在阵地上传了开来。
    一位人民军某部的模范营长罗白钧把刚才送给他的象征着崇高友谊与荣誉的毛主席像纪念章，和雕有斧头镰刀的波兰人民纪念章，同朝鲜共和国授予他的国旗勋章，一块挂在胸前。他热情地说：“有毛主席在我们身边，我们一定能胜利；看一看他，我们也会马上增长起勇气来。”
    防空洞里的“全世界人民团结起来，消灭美国侵略者”的标语，成了罗白钧的主要话题。他说：
    “我们要感谢全世界爱好和平人民的援助，它的力量是这样广泛，这样强大。你们如果注意的话，就会看到今天我们人民军吃的、用的、穿的，除了我国人民支援的外，还有不少是从国际朋友们那里送来的。在前线上，我们可以看到莫斯科出版的彩色画报；能吃到波兰、罗马尼亚的糖。我们穿的衣物中，有中国、德意志共和国、捷克斯洛伐克人民赠的布匹、呢绒，有蒙古人民共和国的皮货，有苏联的皮靴和中国的胶鞋；此外，还有匈牙利人民赠送的药品、绷带。有一次，我在中国人民送来的慰问袋里除收到针线外，还看到一个女工的照片，后面写着：“祝保卫和平的将士，永远康健！”这一切友谊的援助，都是我们朝鲜军民不断获得胜利的重要源泉。”最后，他神彩焕发地说：“我们是光荣的人，在反对帝国主义的前线，我们保卫着世界；同时，我们又是幸福的人，全世界人民都在支援着朝鲜。”
    亲爱的朋友，为着世界和平，为着国家的安全，为着我们的后代，让我们更多地去支援英雄的朝鲜人民吧！
                                                    （新华社）
