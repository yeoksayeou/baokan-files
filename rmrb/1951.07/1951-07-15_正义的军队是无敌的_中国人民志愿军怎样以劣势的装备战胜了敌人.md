The Korean people's war to defend their country against the American aggressors has been going on for a year, and this year's struggle has been arduous, but the victory is glorious. The Chinese people promptly extended a helping hand to the Korean people, organized the Volunteer Army to enter Korea, and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, thus shattering the American aggressors' dream of conquering Korea and invading China, and suppressing their aggressive arrogance.

The Chinese people organized the Volunteer Army to enter Korea to fight only when the American invading army was already approaching the gate of the motherland. Our preparations were not as adequate as those of the American army, which had intended to invade, and our equipment was much worse than that of the American invading army. But the American invading army still failed. This was determined by the nature of the war. A just anti-aggression army, although at a disadvantage in equipment, is bound to achieve final victory, while an army engaged in aggression, no matter how mad and rampant it is, will eventually suffer final defeat.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a just army, composed of the Chinese people who love peace but are brave enough to oppose aggression. This just and mighty army possesses advantages that the American invading army cannot possess. Because of these advantages, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is able to defeat the American invading army, the most ferocious enemy.

Every member of this just army has a high degree of political consciousness. They love their motherland and their friends. They have the Chinese people's tradition of loving peace and rich experience in resisting aggression. And in this just army, standing at the forefront of the struggle are the members of the Chinese Communist Party.

Tens of thousands of soldiers of the Volunteer Army are the liberated people of China. They will never forget the tragic lives they experienced under the barbaric rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now, seeing the American aggressors threatening the safety of the motherland and destroying the peaceful cities and towns of Korea, slaughtering the peaceful people of Korea, the heroic will to defend the motherland's safety and avenge the Korean people has become an infinite source of strength for the warriors.

In the heat of battle, the Volunteer Army warriors shouted the slogan "Perform meritorious service for the people of the world!" The warriors fought while calculating the number of enemies killed: "Knocked down three, and the world has three fewer man-eating spirits!" "I also knocked down three, these robbers can no longer harm people elsewhere!" The Volunteer Army warriors know that they are shouldering the great historical task of safeguarding world peace. In order to accomplish this task, they will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves. They are fighting the American invading army with such a great spirit of patriotism and internationalism.

An army with such a high degree of awareness has unparalleled morale. They are high in fighting spirit, consciously, actively, and positively engaging in combat, and working together to defeat the enemy. Before each battle, Volunteer Army warriors write letters of determination and letters of request to take on the most arduous tasks. Regiment commanders are often surrounded by battalion and company commanders who demand to be assigned the spearhead mission, and in the end, the regiment commander has to resolve the issue with an order. And these battalion and company commanders who were not assigned the spearhead mission have to patiently persuade their soldiers when they return to their units. In the battle on the south bank of the Han River, the enemy's artillery fire melted the snow on the Volunteer Army's position and burned the pine trees, but the Volunteer Army warriors guarding the position issued heroic vows: "The enemy turns our position from white to black, and we will turn the enemy's position from white to red!" They stained the snow with the enemy's dirty blood. Volunteer Army warriors fully know that the enemy soldiers are a bunch of shoddy goods, and as soon as the Volunteer Army rushes into their positions, they are in disarray. Therefore, many Volunteer Army warriors single-handedly charged into the enemy's ranks, swept and killed, and then safely returned to their own positions. In the Yulongpu battle, the lone hero Zhou Degao broke into the enemy camp alone, killing and wounding more than thirty enemies. In the Changjin Lake campaign, the lone hero Chen Desheng single-handedly charged into the enemy's ranks and destroyed three enemy tanks. Similar heroic deeds are countless.

The Volunteer Army warriors' spirit of self-sacrifice for the cause of justice makes the enemy tremble with fear. Shen Yongfu, deputy squad leader of the Seventh Company of a certain unit, was seriously wounded after killing eight American soldiers, but he still used his teeth to open the grenade cover and licked out the fuse with his tongue, and died together with a tank rushing towards him. In the battle at the front of Xiuli Mountain on the south bank of the Han River, Wang Ying, an eighteen-year-old young hero, after killing thirty-five enemies, held explosives and died together with a group of enemies rushing up. The martyr who will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people - Yang Gensi, the heroic company commander of a certain unit, led a platoon of infantry to defend the commanding height on the periphery of Xiajieyuli. After killing and wounding nearly a thousand American robbers, all the platoon commanders and combatants were either heroically sacrificed or gloriously wounded. In the end, the People's Hero Yang Gensi held a package of explosives and died together with more than forty enemies rushing up. The great heroes and the heroic deeds they created will be immortal!

The Volunteer Army soldiers are not only brave fighters, but also resourceful fighters. They are good at using various methods to preserve themselves and kill many enemies. In the battles on the south bank of the Han River and north and south of the 38th parallel, the enemy consumed thousands of shells and used hundreds and thousands of troops to attack a single hill. The Volunteer Army soldiers punished the enemy severely with a small number of troops. In the battle of Hat Mountain southeast of Seoul, an average of one shell fell every four meters on our army's position, and more than ten shells fell on each fortification, but the Volunteer Army warriors defended their position for eight days and nights, annihilating more than a thousand enemies. Tian Wenfu, who won the title of "Hat Mountain Hero Shooter" in the battle, had more than 500 shells of various types fall on his position, and his coat and hat were broken in 58 places by shrapnel. He rolled around in the bomb craters with resourcefulness and continued to shoot at the enemy, killing and wounding more than fifty enemies. Another machine gunner, Qian Shujun, repelled twelve assaults by three enemy routes with one machine gun, killing more than a hundred enemies.

The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are full of hatred for the enemy and love for their comrades, which is in sharp contrast to the American invading army, which is greedy for life, afraid of death, selfish, and self-interested. In the Hengcheng counterattack, Jiang Yuquan, the communist squad leader of the Ninth Company of the sharp knife hero battalion, refused to let the medic bandage his wound after being seriously injured, and asked the medic to rescue other comrades. Before he stopped breathing, he kept asking: "Is anyone injured? Who is it? Go and save them!" In the Masaan defense battle, Wang Shaobo, the battalion commander of a certain Volunteer Army unit, stood inside the destroyed fortification to direct the battle. Enemy bullets were densely fired. The three soldiers next to him jumped in front of him at the same time to protect him with their bodies. Similarly, caring for their comrades is also a natural feeling and a glorious responsibility for every commander. When directing operations, one of the questions they often consider is how to reduce the losses of their comrades and kill a large number of enemies.

The Volunteer Army soldiers have gained richer experience in attacking the enemy's mechanized units through actual combat training. Anti-aircraft shooting has achieved brilliant results. In the thirty days from April 22 to May 21, the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army shot down 168 enemy planes and damaged 68 enemy planes. During the same period, the Volunteer Army destroyed 134 enemy tanks, damaged 13, and captured 80. At the beginning of the Volunteer Army's entry into Korea, there were many tank-fighting heroes; however, the experience of severely annihilating enemy tank groups was gained in later battles. In the New Year offensive, the Volunteer Army destroyed and captured 31 tanks from the British 29th Brigade's heavy tank battalion. In the powerful counterattack in late April, the tank regiment of the British 29th Brigade was severely annihilated again, and the Volunteer Army destroyed, damaged, and captured 71 tanks. Now all the soldiers in the army are enthusiastically launching a campaign to make meritorious contributions in anti-tank warfare, just like striving to make meritorious contributions in anti-aircraft shooting.

In the battle, the Volunteer Army equipped itself with weapons captured from the enemy. The anti-tank hero Pan Zeming used a captured rocket launcher to destroy three enemy tanks with nine rockets. Zhou Jiujing, the heroic battalion commander of a certain unit, captured the enemy's new-style recoilless gun in the battle, and he immediately turned the muzzle of the gun to shoot at the enemy. Many artillery units of the Volunteer Army originally used small-caliber guns, but now they have replaced them with American-made large-caliber howitzers. Some soldiers said: "With American equipment, ammunition replenishment is more convenient. The enemy's logistics department is doing a good job."

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have received enthusiastic support from the people of China and Korea and the peace-loving people of the world. They fully recognize that victory would not have been possible without this support. The Volunteer Army soldiers feel extremely close and loving to everything from the motherland. When the news that the people of the motherland enthusiastically donated airplanes, tanks, and artillery reached the Volunteer Army, the soldiers felt more excited than ever before. They enthusiastically expressed: With new weapons, we will be able to win greater victories and eliminate more enemies.

### 正义的军队是无敌的  中国人民志愿军怎样以劣势的装备战胜了敌人

　　正义的军队是无敌的
    中国人民志愿军怎样以劣势的装备战胜了敌人
    新华社记者  邓超
    朝鲜人民为反对美国侵略者而进行的保卫祖国的战争已经有一年了，这一年的斗争是艰苦的；胜利是辉煌的。中国人民及时地向朝鲜人民伸出了援助的手，组织了志愿军进入朝鲜，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，因而粉碎了美国侵略者征服朝鲜、侵略中国的迷梦，制压了它的侵略凶焰。
    中国人民是在美国侵略军已经逼近祖国大门的时候，才组织志愿军进入朝鲜作战的。我们的准备没有蓄意侵略的美国军队充分，我们的装备也比美国侵略军差得多。可是美国侵略军还是失败了。这是战争的性质决定了的。正义的反侵略的军队虽然在装备上占劣势，可是它一定能取得最后的胜利，而从事侵略的军队不管它怎样疯狂猖獗，总归要遭到最后的失败。
    中国人民志愿军是一支正义的军队，这一支军队是由酷爱和平但是勇于反对侵略的中国人民组成的。这一支正义雄师具备了美国侵略军所不可能具备的优点，由于这些优点，中国人民志愿军就能够打败美国侵略军这一个最凶恶的敌人。
    这支正义的军队的每个成员，都有着高度的政治觉悟。他们热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的友人。他们有着中国人民爱好和平的传统，也有着丰富的反抗侵略的经验。而在这支正义军队中，站在斗争最前列的，又是中国共产党的党员们。
    志愿军的成千成万的战士，都是解放了的中国的人民。他们永远不会忘记自己在日寇和国民党反动派野蛮统治下经历过的悲惨生活。现在他们看到美国侵略者威胁着祖国的安全，并且正在毁灭着朝鲜的和平城乡，屠杀着朝鲜的和平人民，于是保卫祖国安全、为朝鲜人民复仇的英雄意志，就成了勇士们力量的无限源泉。
    在激烈的战斗中，志愿军勇士们喊出了“为全世界人民立功”的口号。勇士们一面打一面计算被打死的敌人的数目：“打倒了三个，世界上少了三个吃人精！”“我也打倒了三个，这些强盗不能再到别处害人了！”志愿军的勇士们知道自己是担当着保卫世界和平的伟大的历史任务，为了完成这个任务，他们即使牺牲自己也在所不惜。他们就是以这样伟大的爱国主义和国际主义的精神对美国侵略军作战的。
    有着这样高度觉悟的军队，它的士气是无比旺盛的。他们斗志奋发，自觉地主动地积极地进行战斗，同心协力来战胜敌人。志愿军勇士们在每一次战斗前都纷纷写决心书、请战书，要求担任最艰巨的任务。团指挥员往往被要求担任尖刀任务的营长、连长们包围住，最后只好由团指挥员以命令来解决。而这些没有分配到尖刀任务的营长连长们回到自己的部队时，还得耐心说服自己的战士。在汉江南岸的战斗中，敌人的炮火融化了志愿军阵地上的积雪，烧枯了苍松，可是守在阵地上的志愿军勇士们却发出了英雄的豪语：“敌人把我们的阵地由白变黑，我们要把敌人的阵地由白变红！”他们就叫敌人的污血染红了雪地，志愿军勇士们完全知道敌人的士兵是蹩脚的货色，只要志愿军一冲进他们的阵地，他们就乱了营。因此，有不少志愿军勇士只身冲入敌阵，横扫直杀，然后安全地回到自己的阵地。在鱼龙堡战斗中，独胆英雄周德高单枪突入敌营，杀伤三十多个敌人。长津湖战役中，独胆英雄陈德生只身冲入敌阵，击毁敌人坦克三辆。类似的英雄事迹是不胜枚举的。
    志愿军勇士们为正义事业献身的自我牺牲精神，使敌人胆寒色变。某部七连副班长沈永福，在打死八个美国兵后，身负重伤，但他仍用牙齿咬开了手榴弹盖，用舌头舐出了弹弦，和向他冲来的一辆坦克同归于尽。在汉江南岸修理山前沿阵地的战斗中，十八岁的青年英雄王英，在打死三十五个敌人以后，抱着炸药与冲上来的一群敌人同归于尽。永远活在中、朝人民心上的烈士——某部英雄连长杨根思，带着一个排的步兵，坚守下碣隅里外围的制高点。在杀伤近千的美国强盗后，全排指挥员和战斗员不是壮烈牺牲就是光荣负伤。最后，人民英雄杨根思抱着一包炸药和冲上来的四十多个敌人同归于尽。伟大的英雄们和他们所创造的英雄业迹永垂不朽！
    志愿军的战士不仅是勇敢的斗士，而且是机智的斗士。他们善于用种种方法保全自己而杀伤众多的敌人。在汉江南岸和北纬三十八度线南北的战斗中，敌人每攻击一个山头，都要消耗几千发炮弹，使用成百成千的兵力。志愿军战士们就以少数兵力痛惩了敌人。在汉城东南帽落山战斗中，我军阵地上平均每隔四公尺即落炮弹一枚，每个工事都落弹十发以上，可是志愿军勇士们坚守阵地八昼夜，歼敌一千多人。在战斗中荣膺“帽落山英雄射手”称号的田文富的阵地上落下各种炮弹五百多发，他的大衣和帽子被弹片打破五十八处。他机智地在弹坑中滚来滚去，继续向敌人射击，杀伤五十多个敌人。另一机枪射手钱树俊，以一挺机枪打退三路敌人的十二次冲锋，打死敌人一百多。
    中国人民志愿军的战士们对敌人充满着仇恨，对自己的战友则充满着热爱，这与贪生怕死自私自利的美国侵略军恰成一个尖锐的对照。在横城反击战中，尖刀英雄营第九连的班长共产党员姜玉泉，在身负重伤以后拒绝卫生员给他包扎伤口，要卫生员去抢救别的战友。在他停止呼吸前，还不断地问着：“有谁负伤没有？是谁？快去救！”在马山守备战中，志愿军某部营长王少伯站在被打坏的工事里面指挥作战。敌人的枪弹密集地射来。在他身旁的三个战士同时跳到他的面前，用身体掩护他。同样地，爱护自己的战友也是每一个指挥员自然的感情和光荣的职责。他们在指挥作战时，经常考虑的问题之一，就是怎样减少自己战友的损失，杀伤大量的敌人。
    志愿军战士们经过了实战的锻炼，已经取得了更丰富的打击敌人机械化部队的经验。对空射击已经获得了辉煌的战果。在四月二十二日至五月二十一日的三十天内，志愿军和朝鲜人民军即击落敌机一百六十八架，击伤敌机六十八架。在同一时期内，志愿军击毁敌军坦克一百三十四辆，击伤十三辆，缴获八十辆。志愿军进入朝鲜作战初期，就有不少的打坦克英雄；但是痛歼敌人坦克群的经验，则是在以后的战斗中取得的。在新年攻势中，志愿军击毁和缴获了英军第二十九旅重坦克营的坦克三十一辆。在四月下旬的强大反击战中，英军第二十九旅的坦克团又遭痛歼，志愿军击毁、击伤、缴获的坦克达七十一辆。现在全军战士都和争取对空射击立功一样，热烈展开着反坦克立功的运动。
    在战斗中，志愿军用缴自敌人的武器装备了自己。反坦克英雄潘泽明用缴获来的火箭筒，以九发火箭弹击毁敌军三辆坦克。某部英雄营营长周九京在战斗中缴了敌人的新式无后座力炮，他立即掉转炮口用来射击敌人。志愿军的很多炮兵部队，原来用的是小口径炮，现在都换上了美国造的大口径榴弹炮。有的战士说：“换了美式装备，弹药补充更方便。敌人后勤部的供应工作做得不坏。”
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军受到了中、朝两国人民和世界爱好和平人民的热烈支援。他们完全认识到：如果没有这种支援，胜利是不可能取得的。志愿军战士们对来自祖国的一切东西都感觉到无比的亲切和热爱。祖国人民热烈捐献飞机、坦克、大炮的消息传到志愿军以后，战士们更是感觉到从来没有过的兴奋。他们热烈表示：有了新式武器，我们就能够打更大的胜仗，消灭更多的敌人。
