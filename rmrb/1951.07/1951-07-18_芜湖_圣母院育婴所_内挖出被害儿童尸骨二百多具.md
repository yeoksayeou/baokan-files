To the Editor:

    The Wuhu branch of the Chinese People's Relief Association, in response to the requests of local people, cooperated with the Wuhu Red Cross on June 15th and 16th to excavate the corpses of Chinese children murdered by imperialist elements Dulesa and Shacixin at the Wuhu Sacred Heart Infant Asylum. As a result, more than two hundred infant corpses were unearthed in the alleyway of the infant asylum and in the vegetable garden behind the back door. Some of these corpses had only been buried recently, some had long black hair on their skulls, and some had pieces of rotten purplish-red muscle. Seeing these corpses is truly heartbreaking and infuriating. People can immediately understand what imperialist "charity" is. I think that similar situations of harming Chinese children may exist in so-called charitable organizations run by imperialist elements in other places. In order to thoroughly settle the blood debts of imperialist elements in China and to further recognize the true face of imperialist elements, I suggest that all parts of the country should conduct investigations and excavations of such "charitable organizations" run by imperialists.

### 芜湖“圣母院育婴所”内挖出被害儿童尸骨二百多具

　　芜湖“圣母院育婴所”内挖出被害儿童尸骨二百多具编辑同志：
    中国人民救济总会芜湖分会接受了当地群众的要求，在六月十五、十六两日，配合芜湖市红十字会，在芜湖市圣母院育婴所内，挖掘为该所帝国主义分子杜勒撒和沙慈心所杀害的中国儿童尸骨。结果在育婴所夹巷内及后门口菜园内，共挖出了婴儿尸骨二百余具。这些尸骨中有一些才埋下不久，有的脑壳上还有黑长的头发，以及一块块腐烂了的紫红色的肌肉。看了这些尸骨，真是令人悲愤。人们立刻可以理解帝国主义的“慈善事业”是什么东西。我想其他各地帝国主义分子所办的所谓慈善机关，也可能有这样残害中国儿童的情形。为了彻底清算帝国主义分子在中国的血债，使我更进一步认识帝国主义分子的真面目，我建议全国各地都应该对帝国主义这类“慈善机关”进行调查和挖掘工作。
