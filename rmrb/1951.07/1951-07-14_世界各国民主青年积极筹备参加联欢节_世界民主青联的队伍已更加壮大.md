Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: According to the TASS news agency, the Komsomolskaya Pravda published a dispatch from its reporters Dobryakov and Knyazev from Budapest on the 10th. The dispatch said: The Third World Youth and Student Festival for Peace, which will be held in Berlin in August, has received enthusiastic support from young people of all strata in various countries. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in Budapest receives letters from young peace fighters from various countries every day. Young people from Austria, Morocco, France, Indonesia, Sweden, Venezuela, Finland, and New Guinea have pledged to overcome all difficulties to come to Berlin. Many letters end with a confident conclusion: "See you in Berlin!"

The dispatch continued: During the preparation for the festival, the prestige of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has been raised to an unprecedented level, and it has constantly received applications for joining the alliance. Young people around the world are increasingly aware that only by uniting in the ranks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth can they resolutely fight to defend peace and strive for freedom and a better future. Advanced youth in Japan have joined the big family of world youth. Young people in Latin America have also joined the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The Vienna meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council has approved the Argentine Patriotic Women's League, the Bolivian University Students' Federation, and the Brazilian Middle School Students' Federation as member organizations. Now the Peruvian Communist Youth League and the Ecuadorian Democratic Youth League have submitted applications. Representatives of these countries have overcome all difficulties and set off for Berlin. The participation of African youth and youth groups from Pacific and Atlantic islands in the World Federation of Democratic Youth has strengthened the ranks even more. The New Zealand Student Labor Federation has joined the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and youth groups from Cameroon and Guinea have also submitted applications.

The dispatch pointed out: All kinds of reactionaries, obeying the orders of their American masters, are trying to split the growing ranks of young peace fighters. The Bonn puppet government recently ordered a ban on the activities of the Free German Youth League because they understand that if all the youth in Germany unite, the plan to rearm West Germany will fail. But this crazy measure only proves their weakness. Just as the West German police are searching for patriotic youth, the organizing committee of the World Youth and Student Peace Festival is receiving more and more letters from West German youth groups expressing their willingness to participate in the festival.

　　世界各国民主青年积极筹备参加联欢节
    世界民主青联的队伍已更加壮大
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十日的共青真理报刊载该报记者多布里雅阔夫及克尼雅捷夫的布达佩斯通讯。通讯说：将于八月间在柏林举行的第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节，已获得世界各国各阶层青年的热情支援。布达佩斯的世界民主青年联盟书记处每天都接到各国青年和平战士的来信，奥地利、摩洛哥、法国、印尼、瑞典、委内瑞拉、芬兰和新几内亚的青年，保证要克服一切困难来到柏林，好多封信都写着充满信心的结语：“在柏林见！”
    通讯接着说：在联欢节筹备期间，世界民主青联的威信已空前提高，它不断地接到要求加入联盟的申请书。世界青年越来越清楚地懂得，只有团结在世界民主青联的队伍里，才能坚决地进行保卫和平及争取自由和美好的将来的斗争。日本的先进青年已经参加了世界青年的大家庭。拉丁美洲的青年也参加了世界青联，世界青联理事会维也纳会议已批准了阿根廷爱国女青年联盟、玻利维亚大学生联合会和巴西中学生联合会为会员团体，现在秘鲁共产主义青年联盟和厄瓜多尔民主青年联盟都提出了申请书。这些国家的代表已克服一切困难，动身前往柏林。非洲青年、太平洋和大西洋诸岛的青年团体参加世界青联的队伍，使这支队伍更加壮大了。新西兰学生劳工联合会已加入世界青联，喀麦隆和几内亚的青年团体也提出了申请书。
    通讯指出：各种各样的反动派听从美国主子的命令，正企图分裂日益壮大的青年和平战士的队伍，波恩傀儡政府最近曾下令禁止自由德国青年联盟活动。因为他们明白，要是全德国的青年团结起来，重新武装西德的计划就要失败。但这种疯狂的措施恰好证明了他们的软弱。正当西德警察搜捕爱国青年的时候，世界青年与学生和平联欢节筹备委员会却收到愈来愈多的西德青年团体的来信，表示愿意参加联欢节。
