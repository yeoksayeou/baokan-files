　　Huaihe River Middle Reaches Diversion Sluice Project
    Fixed Riverbed Begins Water Discharge
    The fixed riverbed and barrage projects of the Runheji Diversion Sluice Project in the middle reaches of the Huaihe River have been completed as planned and started discharging water on the 27th of last month as scheduled. This is a preliminary victory won by more than 40,000 migrant workers, technicians, and cadres at the diversion sluice construction site. Now, they are concentrating all their efforts on rushing to build the lake inlet sluice, which is expected to be fully completed in mid-July.
    The fixed riverbed, barrage, and lake inlet sluice are the three main parts of the Runheji Diversion Sluice Project. According to the plan, after the Runheji Diversion Sluice is completed, the old channel of the Huaihe River's main stream will be blocked, and diversion channels will be excavated at both ends of the fixed riverbed to divert the floodwaters of the Huaihe River's main stream through the diversion channels, passing through the barrage, and discharged downstream through the fixed riverbed. When the water level of the Huaihe River's main stream reaches a certain height, the lake inlet sluice will be opened to release a portion of the floodwaters into Chenxi Lake for storage, in order to reduce the flood level in the middle and lower reaches of the Huaihe River. In order to strive to use the fixed riverbed for water passage before the arrival of the flood season of the Huaihe River, after the start of the diversion sluice project, the workers first concentrated on carrying out the two projects of the fixed riverbed and the barrage.
    Before the barrage and the fixed riverbed began to discharge water, everyone on the construction site was very nervous, and the number of technical workers and migrant workers participating in the construction increased from the original 30,000 to more than 40,000. Although the weather was extremely hot, the workers still worked day and night. From the 22nd to the 24th of last month, there were three consecutive days of heavy rain, the ground was muddy, and the water flowed into rivers in low-lying areas, but the entire project did not stop for a moment. The guard soldiers who protected the safety of the construction site also automatically participated in the transportation of equipment and damming projects when they saw the workers' active work. On the 25th, the cement works of the barrage and the fixed riverbed were all completed, and the large gate of the barrage, about 300 meters wide, was also installed. On the 26th, the rain stopped and the sky cleared, and the workers rushed to complete the remaining projects of the sluice gate day and night, and tested the gate.
    At 10 a.m. on the 27th, the barrage began to discharge water, and tens of thousands of people nearby rushed to visit, with crowds of spectators on both sides of the river. When the rolling Huaihe River water passed through the diversion channel and rushed towards the fixed riverbed, gongs and drums sounded in unison on the shore, and the audience applauded and cheered enthusiastically, with the sounds of gongs, drums, and cheers resounding throughout both banks of the Huaihe River.

　　淮河中游分水闸工程 
    固定河槽开始放水
    淮河中游润河集分水闸工程的固定河槽及拦河闸两项工程，已按计划完成，并如期于上月二十七日开始放水。这是分水闸工地上四万多民工、技术工人和干部们赢得的初步胜利。现在，他们正集中全力赶建进湖闸，预计在七月中旬可以全部完成。
    固定河槽、拦河闸及进湖闸是润河集分水闸工程的三个主要部分。按照计划，润河集分水闸修成之后，即将淮河干流的旧道堵塞，在固定河槽的两端开挖引河，将淮河干流洪水引经引河，通过拦河闸，入固定河槽下泄。当淮河干流的水位达到一定高度时，即打开进湖闸，将一部分洪水放进城西湖拦蓄起来，以降低淮河中下游的洪水位。为了争取在淮河洪水汛期到来前能先利用固定河槽行水，故在分水闸工程开工后，工人们即首先突击进行固定河槽及拦河闸两项工程。
    在拦河闸及固定河槽开始放水之前，工地上每个人都很紧张，参加修建的技术工人和民工等，由原来的三万人增加至四万多人。虽然天气酷热，工人们仍然不分昼夜地工作。上月二十二日至二十四日，曾连下三天大雨，地面上泥泞不堪，低洼处水流成河，但全部工程仍未片刻停止。保卫工地安全的警卫战士们，看到工人们的积极工作，也都自动参加了搬运器材和堵坝工程。二十五日，拦河闸与固定河槽的洋灰工程全部完成，拦河闸上约宽三百公尺的大闸门亦装置就绪。二十六日，雨止天晴，工人们昼夜赶做水闸的其余工程，并试用闸门。
    二十七日上午十时，拦河闸开始放水，附近数万人民争往参观，两岸观众如堵。当滚滚淮水经过引河奔向固定河槽时，岸上锣鼓齐鸣，观众热烈地鼓掌欢呼，锣鼓声，欢呼声响遍淮河两岸。
