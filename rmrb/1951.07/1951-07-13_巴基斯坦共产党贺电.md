The peoples of Asia and the Middle East are struggling against imperialist enslavement. For them, the Communist Party of China is a guiding force, a source of enthusiasm and courage in the struggle for national liberation. For them, the Communist Party of China is an active and powerful defender and supporter in the fight for freedom. China's fraternal assistance to the Korean people has formed the great pride and confidence of all the people of Asia.

	As your younger brother, we reaffirm our commitment to learn from your rich experience. We continue our struggle to obtain true independence for our people from Anglo-American imperialism and to defend world peace.
