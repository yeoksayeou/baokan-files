Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 25th: The Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hoang Minh, issued a statement on the 20th, supporting the Soviet proposal for a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and protesting the U.S. and Britain's preparation for a separate peace with Japan. The statement first pointed out: Japanese troops occupied Vietnam from October 1941 to August 1945, causing great losses to the Vietnamese people. During this period, the Vietnamese people united under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh Front to fight against the Japanese army. After Japan's surrender, the Vietnamese people established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, elected a National Assembly, and formed a national government. Therefore, only the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is the legitimate representative of the Vietnamese people in signing the peace treaty with Japan.

The statement said: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam supports the position expressed in the Soviet government's note to the U.S. government on June 7, 1951, because this position is in accordance with the Yalta Agreement, the Cairo Declaration, and the Potsdam Agreement. The signing of a peace treaty with Japan is the common right of all countries that fought against Japanese fascism. The peace treaty must be discussed and prepared in advance by a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The future peace treaty with Japan must aim at making Japan an independent, democratic, and peace-loving country; and it must prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascism, which previously committed crimes of aggressive war in Asia.

The statement then said: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam protests the conspiracy of the U.S. and British governments to hold a separate peace conference to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam protests the U.S. and British governments' support for Japanese fascists in order to launch a new war of aggression in Asia.

The statement finally pointed out: The French colonialists and their puppet Bao Dai group, who surrendered to Japanese imperialism when the Vietnamese people fought against Japan, have absolutely no right to represent Vietnam and the Vietnamese people in discussing the peace treaty with Japan.

　　越南外长发表对日和约问题声明
　  拥护苏联所提全面缔结对日和约建议
　  抗议美英准备单独媾和利用日本侵略
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十五日电：越南民主共和国政府外交部长黄明鉴于二十日发表声明，拥护苏联所提关于缔结全面对日和约的建议，并抗议美、英准备单独对日媾和。声明首先指出：日本军队曾于一九四一年十月到一九四五年八月占领越南，使越南人民受到很大的损失。在这期间，越南人民团结在胡志明主席领导的越盟阵线下与日军作战。日本投降后，越南人民建立了越南民主共和国，选出国民大会，并成立全国性的政府。因此，在签订对日和约时，只有越南民主共和国政府是越南人民的合法代表。
    声明说：越南民主共和国政府拥护苏联一九五一年六月七日致美国政府照会中所表示的立场，因为这种立场是与雅尔塔协定、开罗宣言、波茨坦协定符合的。签订对日和约是曾与日本法西斯主义作战的一切国家的共同权利。和约必须事先经过苏联、中华人民共和国、美国与英国四国外长会议的讨论与准备。将来的对日和约必须以使日本成为独立、民主、与爱好和平的国家为目的；并必须防止以前犯有在亚洲进行侵略战争的罪行的日本法西斯主义的再起。
    声明接着说：越南民主共和国政府抗议美、英政府为缔结单独对日和约而准备举行单独和会的阴谋。越南民主共和国政府抗议美、英政府为了在亚洲发动新的侵略战争而扶植日本法西斯分子。
    声明最后指出：在越南人民对日作战时，曾向日本帝国主义投降的法国殖民者及其傀儡保大集团绝对无权代表越南及越南人民讨论对日和约问题。
