  "Free Competition" That Annoys British Gentlemen
    According to British newspapers, business circles in Lancashire, the largest textile industry center in Britain, are extremely disturbed to see Japanese goods re-competing in the Southeast Asian and African markets. The Financial Times also said angrily that the United States is supporting Japan.
    Wall Street's monopoly capitalists would pat their aggrieved British counterparts on the shoulder and say, "That's the free competition we've always championed!"
  "Harriman Get Out of Iran!"
    U.S. President Truman sent Harriman to Iran to interfere with Iran's oil nationalization movement. Harriman said in Tehran, "As long as I am useful here, I will stay here."
    For the Iranian people, Harriman is not only not "useful," but also a "notorious warmonger and agent of oil-guzzling imperialists," so the demonstrators in Tehran have long shouted, "Harriman get out of Iran!"
  Assassins of the Middle East
    King Abdullah of Transjordan was assassinated in Jerusalem on the 20th. This was the second political assassination in the Middle East in a week. Four days before Abdullah's assassination, former Lebanese Prime Minister Riad Solh was assassinated in Amman, the capital of Transjordan. Abdullah was a central figure used by Britain to establish a "Greater Syria" including Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Riad Solh's recent visit to Transjordan was widely linked to American attempts to undermine British activities. Abdullah had clashed with the Arab League, dominated by American forces, in his ambition to become the emperor of "Greater Syria".
    The assassinations of Abdullah and Solh illustrate the increasingly sharp conflict of interest between American and British imperialism in the Middle East.

  使英国绅士恼火的“自由竞争”
    据英国报纸说：英国最大纺织业中心兰开夏的企业界看到日本货物重新在东南亚与非洲市场进行竞争，表示极大不安。《金融时报》并十分气愤地说，是美国在给日本撑腰。
    华尔街的垄断资本家会拍拍他们气苦了的英国同伴的肩膀说：“这就是咱们一向标榜的自由竞争呀！”
  “哈里曼滚出伊朗去！”
    美国总统杜鲁门派到伊朗干涉伊朗石油国有化运动的哈里曼在德黑兰说：“只要我在这里有用处，我就在这里住下去。”
    对于伊朗人民，哈里曼不但没有什么“用处”，而且是一个“臭名远扬的战争贩子和喝石油的帝国主义者的代理人”，所以德黑兰的示威群众早就高呼：“哈里曼滚出伊朗去”！
  中东的暗杀者
    外约旦国王阿布杜拉于二十日在耶路撒冷被暗杀。这是一星期内在中东发生的第二件政治性暗杀。在阿布杜拉被刺前四天，前黎巴嫩总理列雅德·索勒哈在外约旦首都安曼被刺。阿布杜拉是英国利用来建立一个包括外约旦、叙利亚、黎巴嫩与伊拉克的“大叙利亚”的中心人物。列雅德·索勒哈最近到外约旦访问他，是与美国企图破坏英国的活动有广泛联系的。阿布杜拉为了想做“大叙利亚”皇帝，曾与美国势力支配下的阿拉伯联盟发生冲突。
    阿布杜拉和索勒哈的被刺，说明美英帝国主义在中东的利害冲突日益尖锐了。
