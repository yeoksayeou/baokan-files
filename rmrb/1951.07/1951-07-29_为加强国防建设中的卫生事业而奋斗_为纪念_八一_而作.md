Strive to Strengthen the Health Undertakings in National Defense Construction
——Written in Commemoration of "August 1st"
　　Fu Lianzhang
　　Twenty-four years ago today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was born. That is to say, from this day on, in the history of China, there began to appear the Chinese people's own armed forces led by the proletarian party—the Communist Party. With a revolutionary party and revolutionary armed forces, the Chinese revolution had leadership and guarantees, and gained continuous victories.
　　There are two kinds of armies: one is a reactionary army, with the sole purpose of oppressing and slaughtering the people; the other is a revolutionary army, with the sole purpose of resisting aggression and liberating the people. There is nothing in common between the two. The army of Japanese imperialism, the army of American imperialism and its vassals, the army of Chiang Kai-shek, and the army of Syngman Rhee are reactionary armies. The people loathe them, hate them, and feel disgusted at the mention of them. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Soviet Red Army, and the armies of all new democratic countries, the Korean People's Army, the Vietnamese People's Army, and all the people's armies that are resisting aggression, are revolutionary armies. The people support them, love them, and feel kind and respectful at the mention of them. The Chinese people look down on old soldiers, calling them "gun-toting fellows" and "Lord Eighth Soldiers," but they have great respect for the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, calling them "Comrades." Because of the completely different nature of the two kinds of armies, the members of the two kinds of armies have produced two completely different evaluations among the people, one is the worst evaluation, and the other is the best evaluation. This is the case for the combat personnel of the army, and it is also the case for the health personnel of the army.
　　Since the emergence of the People's Liberation Army in China, there have also emerged completely new types of military health workers. These health workers, like other personnel of the People's Liberation Army, have advanced wave upon wave, using their wisdom, their sweat, and their lives to complete unprecedented historical tasks. The health workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have rescued and treated millions of the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese working people, and have guaranteed the health of the combat personnel. This is where their glory lies. The health workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have experienced the practical training of arduous combat for a long time, and have received the revolutionary education of Mao Zedong Thought for a long time. This is where their strength lies. What are the fine traditions of the health workers of the People's Liberation Army?
　　First, the health workers of the People's Liberation Army have firm revolutionary aspirations. They come from all directions; some joined the revolutionary ranks from an early age, sharing joys and sorrows, sharing hardships, and studying together with the soldiers, overcoming numerous work difficulties and learning difficulties, and consistently adhering to their work posts; others abandoned their original urban occupations and resolutely joined the revolutionary ranks, regardless of the hardships of life, and consistently adhered to their work posts. In the face of any difficulties and setbacks encountered by the revolution, they have never shown fear or wavering. Many comrades sacrificed gloriously in order to complete the tasks of rescuing, transferring, and treating the wounded. The reason why they can do this is because they work, they live, they fight, not for themselves; their knowledge and skills are not for themselves; they have the revolutionary aspiration to fight for the liberation of the working people, and contribute everything they have to this great cause.
　　Second, the health workers of the People's Liberation Army have a pragmatic revolutionary style. Because their starting point of work is not for themselves, and because they are guided by the most scientific ideological methods, they can break through technical prejudices without the slightest hesitation, and correct their shortcomings and mistakes in their work without reservation. They do not pretend to know what they do not know, but treat work and comrades with an honest attitude of "knowing is knowing, and not knowing is not knowing." Since they have the view of the unity of knowledge and action as their guide for work and study, and there is no "personal face" as an obstacle to their work and study, their work efficiency is still very high even in the face of very difficult material and technical conditions. Their application of knowledge is closely related to the cause of liberating the motherland; their acquisition of knowledge also comes from practical work; therefore, they deeply realize that only knowledge closely integrated with practice is true knowledge.
　　Third, the health workers of the People's Liberation Army have a revolutionary spirit of overcoming difficulties. The history of the health work of the People's Liberation Army for more than 20 years is a history of constantly overcoming difficulties. At the beginning, there was no talk of any conditions at all: without Western medicine, they relied on the medicines seized from the enemy, and went to the mountains to collect Chinese medicine; without equipment, they tried to manufacture substitutes; without enough cadres, they opened schools in the gullies to train them themselves. What was particularly difficult was to ensure the safety of the wounded and sick, and to carry out necessary treatment in the mobile environment of the enemy's layers of blockade and continuous combat. Because they have experienced the most difficult times, and because they have personally created various methods to overcome difficulties, they have also deeply realized that there has never been enough ready-made conditions that can be waited for, only conditions in development that are constantly created.
　　All the above-mentioned revolutionary spirit and fine style are cultivated, consolidated, and continuously promoted by the party's education, especially Chairman Mao's leadership. Now, the Chinese people have seized power throughout the country, and the environment and conditions are of course very different from 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and 5 years ago; however, there is a more ambitious revolutionary future for us to go, and these fine traditions and spirit must continue to be carried forward. Moreover, there are indeed still many comrades among our health personnel who have not fully grasped such a fine traditional spirit, and even individual comrades have grasped very little. Therefore, it is very necessary to repeatedly examine ourselves with such a fine traditional spirit as the criterion.
　　In the face of the serious task of accelerating national defense construction, our health workers have many important tasks to do. First of all, we must expand the ranks of health work and improve our skills. Since the beginning of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, under the influence of patriotic enthusiasm, many local health personnel and young students have either organized medical teams and rushed to the front line, or directly joined the army. This is a huge force. The combination of this force and our original health work force will further improve our work. Our task is how to humbly and sincerely unite this new force, which includes: helping them understand the fine traditional spirit of the People's Liberation Army; helping them become familiar with military life, encouraging them to work boldly and study hard; welcoming their criticisms of the shortcomings of our work; and patiently helping them overcome their shortcomings. In terms of technology, we must learn from each other and improve each other. In addition, we must unite all local health workers, because guaranteeing national defense construction and guaranteeing production construction are interrelated and the tasks are the same.
　　In the process of revolutionary victory, in the development of work victory, what is most worthy of our attention and reminding ourselves at any time? It is to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and to be cautious and humble. Yes, we have participated in the earth-shaking heroic cause, and we have more or less established merits in specific work, but there are still greater causes ahead of us waiting for us to do, and all the merits are inseparable from the leadership of the party, inseparable from the organization, and inseparable from the people; speaking of personal merits, it is just a drop in the ocean. Pride and impetuosity are a wall that hinders unity; pride and impetuosity are a stumbling block that hinders progress. Only humility can do a good job; only caution can avoid mistakes. A person who regards the revolutionary cause as more important than life, a person who can see the great future, must be a person with an open mind and full of vigor, and at the same time, he must be the most humble and cautious person. Chairman Mao therefore earnestly taught us to be humble and cautious, and to guard against arrogance and impetuosity. It is precisely because such a working attitude is an important key for us to do a good job.
　　History is moving forward continuously, and revolutionaries are constantly transforming themselves in the process of transforming society. Anyone who is satisfied with the past cannot move forward with history. Therefore, regardless of the length of work history, regardless of new or old cadres, regardless of the size of existing work ability, we must constantly learn, and improve our understanding from the development of new things. Reviewing history and recalling that we have overcome all kinds of difficulties in the past also gives us greater courage to prepare to meet more arduous tasks. Only by diligently studying new things can we exert more creativity. Only by constantly examining ourselves, daring to abandon the outdated things that are no longer suitable for the new environment, and striving to adapt ourselves to the new environment, can we go to the front without falling behind. Only by adhering to the determination to fight for the revolutionary health cause to the end can we make more achievements in this cause.

　　为加强国防建设中的卫生事业而奋斗
　  ——为纪念“八一”而作
    傅连暲
    二十四年前的今天，诞生了中国人民解放军。也就是说，从这一天起，在中国的历史上，开始出现了由无产阶级的政党——共产党所领导的中国人民自己的武装。有了革命的党，有了革命的武装，中国的革命就有了领导，有了保障，获得了不断的胜利。
    军队有两种：一种是反动的军队，以压迫人民屠杀人民为唯一目的；另一种是革命的军队，以反抗侵略解放人民为唯一目的，两者毫无共同之点。日本帝国主义的军队，美帝国主义及其附庸者的军队，蒋介石的军队，李承晚的军队，是反动的军队，人民厌恶他们，痛恨他们，提起他们就觉得肮脏。中国人民解放军，苏联红军，以及所有新民主主义国家的军队，朝鲜的人民军，越南的人民军，以及所有正在进行反抗侵略的人民军队，都是革命的军队，人民拥护他们，爱戴他们，提起他们就觉得可亲可敬。中国人民看不起旧军人，称他们为“耍枪杆的”为“兵八老爷”，但对于解放军的干部和战士，则非常尊重，称之为“同志”。由于两种军队的性质迥然不同，所以两种军队的成员，在人民中也就产生了两种迥然不同的评价，一种是最坏的评价，一种是最好的评价。对于军队的战斗人员是如此，对于军队的卫生人员也是如此。
    中国自从出现了人民解放军，也就出现了完全新型的部队卫生工作者。这些卫生工作者和解放军其他的人员一样，前仆后继，以他们的智慧，以他们的血汗，以他们的生命，完成了空前的历史任务。中国人民解放军的卫生工作者救治了以百万计的中国劳动人民最优秀的儿女，保障了作战人员的健康，这就是他们光荣的所在。中国人民解放军的卫生工作者在长时间内经历了艰苦作战的实际锻炼，在长时间内受到了毛泽东思想的革命教育，这就是他们的坚强所在。什么是解放军卫生工作者的优良传统呢？
    第一、解放军的卫生工作者有坚定不移的革命志向。他们是来自四面八方的；或者是从小加入了革命队伍，与战士共甘苦，共患难，共学习，克服了重重的工作难关学习难关，始终如一地坚持着自己的工作岗位；或者是抛弃了原在都市的职业毅然地加入了革命队伍，不顾生活上的艰苦，始终如一地坚持着自己的工作岗位。在革命遭受到任何困难与挫折的情况下，他们从未表现畏惧与动摇。有许多同志为了完成抢救伤员转运伤员治疗伤员的任务而光荣地牺牲了。他们所以能够如此，是因为他们工作，他们生活，他们战斗，不是为了个人；他们的学识技术，不是为了个人；他们具有为劳动人民争取解放的革命的志向，并把自己的一切贡献给这个伟大的事业。
    第二、解放军的卫生工作者有实事求是的革命作风。由于他们工作的出发点不是为了个人，由于他们是在最科学的思想方法指导之下，所以他们能最无顾忌地打破技术上的偏见，最无保留地纠正自己在工作中的缺点和错误。他们不是强不知以为知，而是以“知之为知之，不知为不知”的老实态度来对待工作，对待同志。既然有知行统一的观点做他们工作与学习的指导，又没有“个人面子”做他们工作与学习的障碍，所以即或在物质条件技术条件非常困难的情况下，他们的工作效能还是很高。他们的学识的应用是与解放祖国的事业血肉相关的；他们的学识的获得也是来自实际工作；因此，他们深切的体会到唯有与实际密切结合的学识，才是真正的学识。
    第三、解放军的卫生工作者有克服困难的革命精神。解放军卫生工作二十多年来的历史，就是不断克服困难的历史。起初，根本谈不上什么条件：没有西药，就靠缴获敌人的药品，就向山里面去采中药；没有器材，就设法制造代用品；没有足够的干部，就在山沟里自己开办学校来培养。尤其艰难的是在敌人层层封锁，连续作战的流动环境下，保障伤病员的安全，进行必要的治疗。由于他们经历了最困难的时代，由于他们亲自创造了种种克服困难的方法，所以他们也就深深体会到从来没有什么可以坐待而来的足够的现成条件，只有不断创造而来的在发展中的条件。
    所有上述这些革命精神优良作风，都是由于党的教育特别是毛主席的领导才能培植起来巩固起来而且不断发扬光大的。现在，中国人民已经在全国范围内取得了政权，环境和条件当然和二十年前十年前五年前都大不相同了；但是，有更远大的革命前程要我们去走，这些优良传统精神必须继续发扬。而且，在我们的卫生人员中间确实尚有不少同志，没有完全掌握这样的优良传统精神，甚至还有个别同志掌握得很少。因此，以这样的优良传统精神为准绳，来反复检查我们自己，就非常必要。
    在加速国防建设的严重任务前面，我们的卫生工作者正有许多重要工作要作。首先，我们必须扩大卫生工作阵营和提高我们的技术。自从抗美援朝运动开始以来，在爱国主义的热情支配之下，地方上许多的卫生人员和青年学生，或是组织了医疗队，奔赴前线，或是直接参加了军队。这是一个庞大的力量，这一力量和我们原有的卫生工作力量结合起来，将使我们的工作进一步提高。我们的任务是如何虚心诚恳地团结这一新的力量，这包括着：帮助他们领会解放军的优良传统精神；帮助他们熟习部队生活，鼓励他们大胆工作，努力学习；欢迎他们对我们的工作缺点提出批评；对于他们的缺点，也要耐心地帮助他们克服。在技术上，要互相学习，互相提高。此外，我们还要团结所有的地方卫生工作者，因为保障国防建设与保障生产建设，是互相关联的，任务是一致的。
    在革命胜利的进程中，在工作胜利的开展中，最值得我们随时注意随时提醒自己的是什么呢？是要戒骄戒躁，是要谨慎谦虚。是的，我们曾经参加了翻天覆地的英雄事业，我们曾经在具体的工作中或多或少地建立了功劳，但是，仍有更大的事业在我们前面，等待我们去做，而且一切的功劳都是脱离不开党的领导，脱离不开组织，脱离不开人民的；说到个人的功劳，不过是沧海之一粟而已。骄傲和急躁是妨碍团结的一道墙壁；骄傲和急躁是妨碍进步的一块绊脚石。唯有谦虚，才能做好工作；唯有谨慎，才能不犯错误。一个把革命事业看为重于生命的人，一个最能看到远大前途的人，一定是一个心胸开阔富有朝气的人，同时也一定是一个最谦虚最谨慎的人。毛主席所以谆谆地教导我们要谦虚谨慎戒骄戒躁。也正是因为这样的工作态度乃是我们做好工作的重要关键。
    历史在不停地前进，革命者在改造社会的进程中也就不断地在改造自己，凡是满足于过去的就不能随着历史前进。因此，我们不分工作历史的长短，不分新干部老干部，不分现有的工作能力的大小，都必须不断地学习，从新的事物的发展中提高自己的认识。温习历史，回忆到过去我们已经克服了种种的困难，也就使我们有更大的勇气准备迎接更艰巨的任务。唯有对于新的事物，努力钻研，才能发挥更多的创造。唯有随时检查自己，敢于抛掉已经不适于新的环境的陈腐了的东西，努力使自己适应于新的环境，才能走到前面而不致落在后面。唯有抱定为革命卫生事业奋斗到底的决心，才能对于这一事业，做出更多的成就。
