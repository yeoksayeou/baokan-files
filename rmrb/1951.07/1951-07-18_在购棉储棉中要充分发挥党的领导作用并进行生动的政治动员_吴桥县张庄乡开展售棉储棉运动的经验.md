The General Situation of Cotton Farmers' Cotton Planting and Storage in Zhangzhuang Township

　　Zhangzhuang Township, Wuqiao County, has six villages, 710 households, and 2,685 people. The township has a total of 7,784 mu of land, with an average of 2.9 mu per person. In 1950, the township planted 5,372 mu of cotton, averaging about 2 mu per person. Last year, the average yield per mu was about 100 jin of seed cotton, with a total output of 541,540 jin of seed cotton. In addition to state purchases, cotton farmers' self-use, and some flowing into other areas, cotton farmers still had 136,500 jin of cotton in storage. In 1951, the township planted a total of 6,559 mu of cotton, accounting for 85.7 percent of the total area. If the estimated yield per mu is 117 jin, the township can produce 750,000 jin of seed cotton. According to comrades from the county, the township can represent the general situation of cotton-producing areas in Wuqiao County. The cotton purchasing, storage, and pre-purchase working group jointly formed by the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Office and the prefectural and county cooperatives took the township as the key point to mobilize farmers to carry out the patriotic cotton selling and storing movement and combined it with pre-purchase. After half a month of work, the township completed the purchase and storage of more than 110,000 jin of cotton, accounting for more than 81 percent of the cotton farmers' stored cotton. In terms of pre-purchase, the lint cotton under contract accounted for more than 83 percent of the total cotton planting output and 91.45 percent of the total output of contracted households. The general masses responded well. From these facts, it can be seen that Zhangzhuang Township completed the task of purchasing, storing, and pre-purchasing cotton relatively satisfactorily.

How was the Cotton Purchasing and Storage and Pre-purchase Work Carried out in Zhangzhuang Township?

　　Before the work began, although the township had made general arrangements for the cotton purchasing and storage work, the cotton farmers generally did not understand why cotton purchasing and storage was necessary; they did not know the methods of cotton purchasing and storage; and they had many concerns about selling and storing cotton to the state because the propaganda and mobilization work was done poorly. The most common concerns were the fear of "revealing wealth," the fear of "changing class status," the fear that the price was not appropriate, the fear that storing cotton in the cooperative would not be free, the fear of offending people (because in the past, some people had borrowed cotton and sworn that they did not), the fear of losing out if the price of cotton rose again, and even the township party branch secretary was unwilling to sell his stored cotton. Of course, in addition to these concerns, there were also more common social habits and psychological reasons. Farmers in cotton-producing areas generally regarded cotton as a means of storage, and the psychology of storing cotton and being reluctant to sell it was very strong; some farmers were willing to keep cotton at home, and they felt comfortable when they saw cotton when they were tired from work. Therefore, farmers took a perfunctory attitude towards selling and storing cotton, and village cadres took out a few jin to deal with it when "mobilizing." Until before June 12, the amount of cotton sold and stored by cotton farmers was still not large. Based on this situation, the working group believed that the main reasons why the cotton selling and storing movement in the township could not be carried out were: 1. The Resist America, Aid Korea movement had not yet been carried out very well; 2. The CCP Township Branch had not paid attention to the leadership of this work. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out patriotic propaganda and education extensively and deeply throughout the township with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement as the center, and mobilize the masses to launch a patriotic cotton selling and storing movement.

　　In order to carry out this movement in a planned and step-by-step manner, the working group decided to first convene an enlarged meeting of the township branch on the evening of June 13. At the meeting, it conveyed the instructions of the CCP Central Committee on ensuring the victorious completion of the cotton purchasing and storage task and the instructions of the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee and the Dezhou Prefectural Committee to clear the minds of the branch cadres. On the 14th, a general meeting of party and league members and the board of directors of the Zhangzhuang Cooperative was held to convey the instructions of the higher authorities, explaining the impact of the nationwide yarn mills stopping work due to lack of raw cotton on Resist America, Aid Korea, the country, workers, and cotton farmers, and using examples of the contrast between cotton farmers' lives before and after liberation to illustrate that the improvement of cotton farmers' lives was mainly due to the government's strong support, and cotton farmers should cherish their country; explaining that selling cotton, storing cotton, and signing pre-purchase contracts were practical actions for cotton farmers to love the country; explaining the specific methods of selling cotton, storing cotton, and signing pre-purchase cotton contracts with the cooperative to make farmers understand that personal interests and national interests are consistent; put forward the slogan "Selling Cotton and Storing Cotton to the Country is Both Patriotic and Making a Fortune," and in response to the specific concerns of cotton farmers, publicize the ten policies on developing agricultural production promulgated by the East China Military and Political Commission; mobilize party and league members to carry out propaganda work well in selling and storing cotton, and use their practical actions to play a leading role. At the meeting, the various aspects of selling and storing cotton were explained clearly, giving party and league members ideological weapons.

　　After four days of propaganda and deliberation, a meeting of cooperative members and cotton farmer representatives from the entire township was held on June 17. At the meeting, the propaganda content of the party and league member meeting was repeatedly publicized and explained. The emotions of cooperative members and cotton farmer representatives were extremely high. During group discussions, the representatives used the recollection and comparison of life before and after the turnaround to talk about the suffering of cotton farmers under the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and the current government's lending of fertilizers, seeds, and food to solve the difficulties of cotton farmers' production, and also stipulated the cotton-grain price ratio to ensure the interests of cotton farmers. The representatives used many vivid facts to illustrate the loveliness of the current country and improve the patriotic thought of Resist America, Aid Korea. When discussing at the meeting, the speeches were very enthusiastic, and even the representatives who were usually considered "backward" and did not participate in the meeting very much also spoke actively. Some farmers said: "In the past, they only said I was 'backward' and did not explain the truth to me; today I understand clearly, and I will definitely sell the cotton to the country or store it in the cooperative, and I will no longer be 'backward'." At the meeting, each village conducted challenge competitions and set out competition conditions. Cotton farmer representative Hou Zhenkun had always not participated in meetings in the past. This time, because he benefited from storing cotton and understood the reasons for selling and storing cotton, he not only introduced his experience of benefiting from storing cotton at the meeting, but also became an active member of participating in the meeting to publicize storing and selling cotton. In the past, Dingzhuang was always considered the "backward village" in the township, but this time it also set off a warm cotton selling and storing movement.

　　Because the meeting of cooperative members and cotton farmer representatives was relatively successful, the representatives generally actively carried out propaganda and mobilization through meetings, small meetings, and individual talks after returning, truly achieving household knowledge. Therefore, a climax of patriotic cotton selling and storing movement was set off throughout the township. Selling and storing cotton became the center of street talks. On the 18th, the township cooperative purchased and stored 17,000 jin of cotton, 15,000 jin on the 19th, and by the 23rd, including the cotton purchased and stored from June 1 to 12, it totaled 110,398 jin. Except for a few cotton farmers who still have some cotton in storage, generally speaking, it has been basically completely sold or stored. After the cotton selling and storing work came to an end, the township proceeded to sign pre-purchase contracts. Because the propaganda and education work in the previous stage was sufficient, the pre-purchase work encountered almost no difficulties. In just three days from the 24th to the 26th, the task of pre-purchasing 624,655 jin of seed cotton was completed. Except for individual households, almost all households signed pre-purchase contracts with the cooperative.

Main Experiences in Completing the Task of Purchasing, Storing, and Pre-purchasing Cotton

　　First, giving full play to the core leadership of the branch and the exemplary leading role of party and league members is the basic key to carrying out the cotton purchasing and storage movement and completing the pre-purchase. Zhangzhuang Township convened an enlarged meeting of the township branch and a general meeting of party and league members in advance, conveyed and discussed the instructions of the party at higher levels, improved the political consciousness of party and league members, and gave them ideological weapons to publicize and mobilize the masses. Therefore, party and league members not only became active members in selling cotton, storing cotton, and signing pre-purchase contracts, but also became capable propagandists and mobilizers among the masses, and became leading backbones to lead the masses.

　　Second, combining the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education, explaining clearly to the masses that selling cotton, storing cotton, and signing pre-purchase contracts to the country are beneficial to both the country and cotton farmers; explaining clearly the specific methods of selling cotton, storing cotton, and signing pre-purchase contracts: especially through group discussions and deliberation, using complaining and recalling the life contrast before and after the turnaround, inspiring the patriotic enthusiasm of the members and cotton farmers, and making farmers understand that the national interest is consistent with the personal interest, which is also one of the main keys to carrying out the patriotic cotton selling and storing movement.

　　Third, hold a good meeting of members and cotton farmer representatives. Sufficient deliberation and preparation work should be carried out before the meeting. Attention should be paid to explaining the specific methods of selling and storing cotton, understanding the concerns of the masses, discovering and cultivating activists, and studying the experience of eliminating concerns through branch meetings, party and league member meetings, cooperative member meetings, women member meetings, cotton farmer symposiums, and individual talks; especially persuading cotton farmers with more stored cotton and greater concerns to voluntarily sell and store cotton, and use them as typical examples to play a leading role at the meeting, the effect will be greater.

　　Fourth, doing a good job in tiered price negotiation to ensure the fairness and reasonableness of prices, so that the masses can realize from the actual benefits that the state cares for the interests of farmers, which is an important condition to ensure the carrying out of cotton purchasing, storage, and pre-purchase.

　　在购棉储棉中要充分发挥党的领导作用并进行生动的政治动员
    ——吴桥县张庄乡开展售棉储棉运动的经验
    贺致平
  张庄乡棉农植棉存棉一般情况
    吴桥县张庄乡共六个村，七一○户，二六八五人，全乡共有土地七七八四亩，平均每人有地二亩九分。一九五○年全乡植棉五三七二亩，平均每人植棉约二亩。去年每亩平均约产籽棉一百斤，共产籽棉五十四万一千五百四十斤。除国家收购，棉农自用及部分流入外区外，棉农尚存棉十三万六千五百斤。一九五一年全乡共植棉六千五百五十九亩，占总面积的百分之八十五点七，如估计每亩产量为一百一十七斤，则全乡可产籽棉七十五万斤。据县里同志谈，该乡可代表吴桥县产棉区的一般情况。山东省合作总社与专区、县社合组的购棉储棉及预购工作组，即以该乡为重点，发动农民开展爱国主义的售棉储棉运动，并结合进行预购。经过半月工作，该乡共完成购棉储棉十一万余斤，占棉农存棉数量的百分之八十一强。在预购方面已签订合同的皮棉占植棉总产量的百分之八十三强，占签订合同户总产量的百分之九十一点四五。一般群众反映良好。从这些事实可以看出，张庄乡较完满地完成了购棉储棉与预购棉花的任务。
  张庄乡的购棉储棉与预购工作是怎样进行的？
    工作开始前，该乡虽对购棉储棉工作作过一般的布置，但由于宣传动员工作作得很差，棉农一般不了解为什么要购棉储棉；不知道购棉储棉的办法；对向国家售棉储棉有很多顾虑。最普遍的顾虑是怕“露了富”，怕“改变成份”，怕价格不合适，怕把棉花存到合作社不自由，怕得罪人（因过去有人借棉已咬死了口说没有），怕棉花再涨了价吃亏，甚至乡支部书记的存棉亦不愿卖出。当然，除了这些顾虑之外，还有较普遍的社会习惯与心理的原因，棉区农民较普遍地把棉花当作贮蓄手段，存棉惜售的心理很浓厚；有些农民愿意把棉花放在家里，工作劳累时看到棉花心里很舒服。因此，农民对卖棉存棉抱着应付态度，村干部“动员”时即拿出几斤应付应付。直到六月十二日以前，棉农卖棉存棉的数量仍不大。工作组根据这一情况，认为该乡棉农卖棉存棉运动不能开展的主要原因是：一、抗美援朝运动尚未很好展开；二、中共乡支部尚未重视这一工作的领导。因此应在全乡以抗美援朝运动为中心普遍深入地进行爱国主义的宣传教育，发动群众展开爱国主义的卖棉存棉运动。
    为了使这一运动有领导有步骤地展开，工作组决定首先于六月十三日晚由乡支部召开支部扩大会议，在会上传达中共中央关于保证购棉、储棉任务胜利完成的指示和中共中央山东分局及德州地委的指示，打通支部干部思想。十四日召开全乡党、团员大会及张庄合作社的理事会，传达上级指示，说明全国纱厂因缺乏原棉停工对抗美援朝、对国家、对工人以及对棉农的影响，用解放前后棉农生活对比的实例，说明棉农生活的改善主要由于政府的大力扶持，棉农应爱护自己的国家；说明售棉、储棉及签订预购合同，是棉农爱国的实际行动；说明向国家售棉、储棉及和合作社签订预购棉花合同的具体办法，使农民了解个人利益与国家利益是一致的；提出“向国家售棉储棉既爱国又发家”的口号，并针对棉农具体顾虑，宣传华东军政委员会颁布的关于发展农业生产的十大政策；动员党、团员在售棉储棉中很好地进行宣传工作，并用自己的实际行动起带头作用。会上把售棉储棉各方面的道理讲解清楚，给了党、团员以思想武器。
    经过四天的宣传酝酿，于六月十七日召开了全乡的合作社员、棉农代表会议。会上又把党、团员大会上的宣传内容进行了反复的宣传解释。合作社社员及棉农代表的情绪极为高涨。小组座谈时，各代表用解放前后生活的回忆对比，诉说过去日寇及国民党反动派政府统治下棉农所受的痛苦，以及现在政府贷给肥料、种籽、粮食，解决棉农生产的困难，又规定了棉粮比价保证棉农利益。代表们用许多生动事实说明了现在国家的可爱，提高了抗美援朝爱国主义的思想。大会讨论时发言都很踊跃，即连平日许多人认为“落后”不大参加会议的代表，也积极发言。有的农民说：“过去光说俺‘落后’，不给俺讲清道理；今天心里透亮了，回去一定把棉花卖给国家或存到合作社，我再不‘落后’了。”会上各村都进行了挑战竞赛，订出竞赛条件。棉农代表侯振坤过去一贯不参加会议，这次因储棉得到好处，又听懂了售棉储棉的道理，他不仅在会上介绍了自己储棉得到好处的经验，而且成为参加会议宣传储棉售棉的积极分子。过去丁庄一向被认为是该乡的“落后村”，这次也掀起了热烈的售棉储棉运动。
    由于合作社员、棉农代表会议开得比较成功。代表回去后一般都通过大会、小会、个别谈话等方式，积极进行宣传动员，真正做到家喻户晓。因而在该乡普遍掀起了爱国主义售棉储棉运动的高潮。售棉储棉成了街谈巷议的中心。十八日该乡合作社购棉储棉即达一万七千斤，十九日为一万五千斤，到二十三日止，连六月一日至十二日所购储的，共为十一万零三百九十八斤。除少数棉农仍存有部分棉花外，一般地讲已基本上完全卖出或存出。在售棉储棉工作告一段落后，该乡即接着进行签订预购合同的工作。由于前一阶段宣传教育工作进行的充分，预购工作几乎没有遇到什么困难，仅在二十四日到二十六日，三天之间即完成预购籽棉六十二万四千六百五十五斤的任务，除个别户以外，几乎各户全部与合作社订了预购合同。
  完成购棉储棉及预购棉花任务的主要经验
    第一、充分发挥支部的核心领导及党、团员的模范带头作用，是开展购棉、储棉运动及完成预购的基本关键。张庄乡由于事先召开了乡支部扩大会议及全乡党、团员大会，传达与讨论上级党的指示，提高了党、团员的政治觉悟，并给他们以宣传动员群众的思想武器。因此，党、团员不但成为售棉、储棉及订预购合同的积极分子，而且在群众中成为有能力的宣传鼓动者，成为带领群众的领导骨干。
    第二、结合抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，向群众讲清向国家售棉、储棉和订预购合同对国家对棉农都有好处；讲清售棉、储棉及订预购合同的具体办法：尤其通过小组座谈会酝酿，运用诉苦、回忆翻身前后的生活对比，启发了社员和棉农的爱国热情，并使农民了解到国家利益与个人利益的一致，这也是开展爱国售棉储棉运动的主要关键之一。
    第三、开好社员、棉农代表会。会前应进行充分的酝酿和准备工作。应注意通过支部会议，党、团员会议，合作社员、妇女会员、棉农座谈会及个别谈话等，讲解售棉储棉具体办法，了解群众顾虑，发现与培养积极分子，研究解除顾虑的经验；尤其是说服存棉多顾虑较大的棉农，自愿售棉储棉，并在会议上作为典型起带头作用，效果更大。
    第四、作好分级议价保证价格的公平合理，使群众从实际好处中认识到国家对农民利益的关照，这是保证开展购棉储棉及预购的重要条件。
