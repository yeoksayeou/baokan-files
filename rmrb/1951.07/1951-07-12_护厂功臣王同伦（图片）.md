    (13) The special agent wanted to use the oil splashed on the electric roller while snatching the oil drum to set it on fire and burn the electric roller. He was crouching down to light the fire when Wang Tonglun grabbed his collar and pulled him over. The fire was also blown out by the fan. In this way, the large electric roller was not burned.
    (14) The workers who were holding a meeting in the calendering workshop immediately stopped the meeting after the lights went out. Zhang Bingchen, a worker near the electric roller, vaguely heard the sound of "Catch the special agent..." Because it was completely dark in the room, he could not see anyone, so he ran to the guard squad to report the situation. The guard squad immediately surrounded the entire factory.
    (15) Electric substation worker Li Dexiang rushed to the power room to check the switch and found that the wire had been cut. Wang Tonglun was injured in the waist and lay unconscious next to the electric roller. After first aid, Wang Tonglun regained some consciousness and said, "There... is... a special agent..."

    （十三）特务想利用抢夺油桶时溅到电滚上的油，点火烧毁电滚。他正在蹲下点火时，被王同伦抓住衣领拉了个跟头。火也被风扇吹灭了，这样大电滚就没有被烧着。
    （十四）正在压延车间开会的工人，在电灯熄灭了之后，马上停止会议，在电滚附近的工友张炳臣，隐约地听到“抓特务……”的声音。他因全屋漆黑看不见一个人，就跑到守卫班报告情况，守卫班立刻把全厂包围起来了。
    （十五）变电所工人李德祥迅速赶到动力室检查电门，发现电线被剪断了。王同伦腰部受了伤，躺在电滚旁昏迷不醒，经过急救后，王同伦才有些苏醒，说了声“有……特务……”。
