	A Great Creation of the Communists in the War of Resistance Against Japan
	——Remembering the Tunnel Warfare on the Hebei-Central Plains——
	Zeng Wenjing
	During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party led the people of Hebei-Central in creating unprecedented tunnel warfare under extremely difficult conditions, and waged an arduous struggle against the Japanese invaders who were armed to the teeth. The scale of the tunnel warfare in Hebei-Central was grand. By the end of 1944, there were more than 25,000 miles of tunnels. The Communist Party and the people of Hebei-Central relied on these tunnels, coupled with other forms of struggle, and finally defeated the Japanese invaders.

		The Earliest Tunnels
	The tunnel warfare in Hebei-Central began in Lixian County, which has a tradition of revolutionary struggle. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people of Lixian County was very high. Anti-Japanese regimes were generally established in villages, and anti-Japanese organizations were formed to persist in the struggle against the Japanese invaders on the plains. In 1940, the Japanese invaders used considerable force to surround the villages of Songjiazhuang, Sunjiazhuang, Yangmazhuang, Wangxingzhuang, and Chelizhuang in the first district of Lixian County, and killed more than 100 civilians. Afterwards, they often raided and surrounded villages at night and dawn, capturing anti-Japanese cadres and anti-Japanese people. But this bloody suppression did not intimidate the brave and highly intelligent Communists. In order to more effectively combat the enemy and prevent the Japanese invaders from suddenly surrounding and attacking at night, secret, slanting tunnels, more than a zhang deep, were dug in the woods, wilderness, and ancient tombs outside the villages. People lived in the tunnels at night, and some people also began to dig hidden tunnels in order to avoid being slaughtered, raped, or robbed by the enemy.
	In the early winter of 1940, the Lixian County Party Committee of the Communist Party summarized this experience and instructed each district to select secluded courtyards in villages with a good working foundation to dig multiple secret tunnels. Later, these tunnels were connected to become tunnels. The courage of the masses to struggle was greatly increased due to the support of the tunnels. Zhongmengchang Village in the seventh district of Lixian County was only three miles away from the enemy stronghold, but the masses bravely persisted in the struggle against the enemy. Once, two female members of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard saw the enemy coming to the village to disrupt, so they ambushed on the roof, and when the enemy approached, they used grenades to kill two enemies, and then calmly passed through the tunnel and transferred to the outside of the village. This kind of tunnel gradually developed with the needs of the struggle against the enemy. Many villages changed multi-entrance caves into multi-layered "ring caves". Some of these "ring caves" had as many as two or three layers. After people crawled in, they blocked the entrance of the cave, which was not easy for the enemy to detect, and they were not afraid of the enemy releasing poison gas after they were detected.

		Using Tunnels to Strike the Enemy
	Soon the Japanese invaders set up a stronghold in Daquti Village in the third district of Lixian County, and the entire third district was threatened. The Communists and the masses in the third district vowed to take down the Daquti stronghold. When there was a "green gauze curtain" (Note 1), the people's armed forces cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in combat. When the "green gauze curtain" fell, they dug a tunnel network, using tunnels to connect the villages and carry out tunnel warfare. Wang Fu, Secretary of the Lixian County Party Committee of the Communist Party, personally went to the third district to study the situation of tunnel warfare and further promoted this excellent experience.
	From then on, as soon as the enemy in the stronghold moved, the old men, women, and children in the village safely transferred out of the tunnel, and the cadres led the militia to ambush at the intersection or on the roof to block the enemy. They often beat the enemy to a pulp, and then transferred out of the tunnel. When the enemy retreated, the village militia chased out of the tunnel again and beat the enemy's ass hard.
	After creating tunnel warfare, the broad masses of the people also actively participated in this struggle. In the battle of Quti Village, after the guerrillas and militia of the Third District surrounded more than 50 puppet soldiers, the men, women, old and young in the village automatically assisted in the battle. Children carried wooden cannons for the guerrillas and militia, old men delivered gunpowder, and they also cheered and shouted to kill, which immediately frightened the enemy and made it difficult for them to advance or retreat. It was not until Baoding sent more than 200 Japanese soldiers to rescue them that they broke through and escaped. This battle was fought very well, and it severely hit the enemy. At that time, the Administrative Office of the Hebei-Central Liberated Area issued an order to commend it. The Hebei-Central District Party Committee also decided to universally launch this tunnel struggle in the entire Hebei-Central District.

		Persisting in the Struggle
	In May 1942, on the 60,000 square kilometers of Hebei-Central, the Japanese invaders concentrated more than 60,000 troops, relying on 1,500 strongholds, using 700 vehicles, and launched a large-scale offensive against the anti-Japanese people. Okamura Neji, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army stationed in China, personally flew to direct the operation, attempting to completely eliminate the anti-Japanese forces on the Hebei-Central Plain.
	During the "May 1st Sweep," the people's armed forces in some places defeated the Japanese invaders through tunnel warfare. When the Japanese Invaders' Kajima Brigade attacked the Beihoufang area of Gaowu County (the joint county of Gaocheng and Wuji during the Anti-Japanese War), they encountered serious attacks from the local militia and guerrillas. When the Japanese invaders entered the village, landmines exploded everywhere, and grenades flew down from the high houses, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. The Japanese invaders desperately rushed to the high houses, and the guerrillas and militia safely transferred into the tunnels, attacking the Japanese invaders unpredictably from the various cave entrances. The enemy only saw grenades constantly exploding, and only saw bullets constantly flying, but could not see the traces of the guerrillas and militia. In this battle, the Kajima Brigade suffered more than 100 casualties. Afterwards, the people's armed forces in this area relied on tunnels and landmines to defeat the enemy's seven or eight attacks, killing and wounding four or five hundred Japanese and puppet troops.

		Underground Villages
	The Japanese invaders carried out frantic retaliation against these anti-Japanese villages. The tunnels in each village were suitable for the needs of the struggle, from small to large, from simple to complex. These tunnels included combat tunnels, hidden tunnels and caves for the masses, secret conference rooms for cadres, toilets, places for drawing drinking water, cattle pens and pigsties, and were equipped with anti-poison, fireproof, and smoke-proof facilities. This was simply an "underground village." Later, the "underground villages" were connected to the above-ground villages, and the tunnels in each village, each district, and each county were also connected, forming a huge anti-Japanese fortress.

		"Fantastic War"
	Tunnel warfare formed a kind of "fantastic war" in Hebei-Central. This kind of war made it impossible for the enemy to see people, but they were in danger of being killed at any time. When the enemy passed through the woods and ancient tombs, bullets were fired from the woods and ancient tombs; when the enemy approached dilapidated temples and toilets, bullets were fired from the dilapidated temples and toilets; when the enemy rushed into the village, grenades exploded overhead, and landmines exploded under their feet, killing the enemy inexplicably and causing them to complain endlessly. When the enemy turned around and ran away, bullets continued to be fired and landmines continued to explode, making it impossible for the enemy to even take back their corpses. Therefore, among the enemy, the following words became popular: "The magical Eighth Route Army comes and goes without a trace, and can strike wherever it wants!"
	Relying on the tunnels, the people's armed forces slowly advanced towards the enemy-occupied areas. At night, the militia attacked from the tunnels, surrounding the enemy's strongholds, either attacking or persuading them to surrender, forcing the enemy to gradually retreat. The enemy's strongholds were squeezed out and destroyed one by one. The liberated areas gradually expanded, and the enemy-occupied areas gradually shrank.

　　共产党人在抗日战争中的一个伟大创造
    ——追记冀中平原的地道战——
    曾文经
    抗日战争中，共产党领导冀中人民，在极端困难的条件下，创造了世界上绝无仅有的地道战，和武装到牙齿的日寇进行艰苦卓绝的斗争。冀中地道战的规模是宏大的，一九四四年底，已经有了二万五千里以上的地道。共产党和冀中人民依靠这些地道，再加上其他斗争方式的配合，终于把日寇打败了。
            最早的地道
    冀中的地道战，是从具有革命斗争传统的蠡县开始的。抗日战争开始后，蠡县人民的抗日情绪非常高涨，各村普遍建立抗日政权，组织抗日团体，在平原对日寇坚持斗争。一九四○年，日寇曾用相当大的兵力，包围蠡县第一区的宋家庄、孙家庄、杨马庄、王幸庄、车里庄等村，捕杀了一百多名老百姓。以后又经常在夜里和拂晓奔袭包围村庄，捕捉抗日干部和抗日人民。但是这种血腥的镇压，并没有吓倒勇敢和具有高度智慧的共产党人。为了更有力地打击敌人，防止日寇夜晚突然包围袭击，便在村外的树林、荒野、古墓里，秘密地挖掘一丈多深的斜形地洞，夜晚住在洞里，有些群众为了避免被敌人屠杀、奸淫、抢劫，也开始挖掘隐蔽地洞。
    一九四○年初冬，蠡县共产党县委总结了这种经验，指示各区在工作基础较好的村庄，选择偏僻院落，挖掘多口的秘密地洞。后来又把这些地洞挖通，变成地道。群众斗争的勇气，由于有了地道的依托而大大增加了。蠡县七区中孟尝村，离敌据点才三里，但群众勇敢地坚持了对敌斗争。有一次，两个抗日先锋队的女队员看见敌人来村扰乱，便埋伏在房上，等敌人接近时，用手榴弹炸死了两个敌人，随后从容穿过地道，转移到村外。这种地道，随着对敌斗争的需要而逐渐发展了。许多村把多口洞改为多层的“连环洞”，这种“连环洞”，有的多至两、三层。人钻进去以后，即把洞口堵死，既不容易被敌人发觉，也不怕敌人发觉后施放毒气。
            利用地道，打击敌人
    不久日寇在蠡县第三区大曲堤村扎了据点，整个三区受到威胁。三区的共产党人和群众立誓要把大曲堤据点拿下来。在有“青纱帐”（注一）时，人民武装配合解放军部队作战。“青纱帐”一倒，便挖了地道网，用地道把各村联结起来，进行地道战。蠡县共产党县委书记王夫亲自到三区研究了地道战的情况，进一步推广了这一优良经验。
    从此，据点里的敌人一出动，村里的老汉、妇女、小孩，便从地道里安全地转移出去，干部就带领民兵，埋伏在路口或房上阻击敌人。经常把敌人打得落花流水，然后从地道中转移出去。在敌人退却时，各村民兵又从地道中追出来，痛打敌人的屁股。
    创造地道战以后，广大人民也积极参加了这种斗争。在曲堤庄战斗中，等三区游击队和民兵，把五十多个伪军包围起来后，村里的男女老幼便自动助战，儿童给游击队、民兵抬送木炮，老头子送火药，又助威喊杀，立刻吓得敌人惊慌失措，进退两难。直到保定派了二百多鬼子赶来救应后，才突围逃走。这一仗打得很好，重重地打击了敌人一下。当时冀中解放区行政公署，曾传令嘉奖。冀中区党委，并决定在冀中全区普遍展开这种地道斗争。
            坚持斗争
    一九四二年五月，在冀中六万平方公里的地面上，日寇集中了六万多兵力，依托一千五百个据点，使用七百辆汽车，向抗日人民大举进攻。日本驻华派遣军总司令冈村宁次亲自坐飞机前往指挥，企图彻底消灭冀中平原上的抗日力量。
    在“五一扫荡”中，有些地方的人民武装，用地道斗争战胜了日寇。日寇加岛大队向藁无县（抗战时期藁城、无极的联合县）北候坊一带进攻时，遇到当地民兵和游击队严重的打击。日寇进了村庄，地雷到处爆炸，手榴弹从高房上飞下来，敌人死伤甚重。日寇拼命抢到高房上，游击队和民兵安全地转入地道，在各洞口出没无常地袭击日寇，敌人只看见手榴弹不断爆炸，只看见枪弹不断飞来，却看不见游击队和民兵的踪影。在这次战斗中，加岛大队伤亡了一百多人。以后，这一带的人民武装依靠地道和地雷，击溃了敌人七八次进攻，杀死杀伤日伪军四五百人。
            地下村庄
    日寇对这些抗日村庄进行了疯狂的报复。各村的地道适合斗争需要，由小而大，由简单而复杂。这些地道中，有战斗地道，有群众的隐蔽地道和地洞，有干部的秘密会议室，有厕所，有汲取饮水处，有牛栏猪圈，并有防毒、防火、防烟等设备，这简直是一种“地下村庄”。以后，“地下村庄”和地上村庄连结起来，各村、各区、各县的地道也连结起来，构成一个巨大的抗日堡垒。
        “奇幻的战争”
    地道战在冀中形成一种“奇幻的战争”。这种战争使敌人看不见人，但是随时有被杀死的危险。敌人经过树林、古墓，树林、古墓中射出了枪弹；敌人走近破庙、厕所，破庙、厕所中射出了枪弹；敌人冲进村子，手榴弹在头上爆炸，地雷在脚下爆炸，杀得敌人莫名其妙，叫苦连天。等敌人回身逃跑时，枪弹又连续射击，地雷又连续爆炸，使得敌人连尸首也拉不回去。于是，在敌人中间，就流行着这样的话：“神八路，来无影，去无踪，要打那儿就打那儿！”
    人民武装依托地道，慢慢向敌占区进逼。夜里，民兵从地道中出击，把敌人据点团团围住，或是攻打，或是说降，逼迫敌人逐步撤退。敌人的据点一个个被挤掉，被毁灭。解放区逐渐扩大，敌占区逐渐缩小了。
