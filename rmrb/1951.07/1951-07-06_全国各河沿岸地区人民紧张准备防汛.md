People in Riverbank Areas Across the Country are Nervously Preparing for Flood Control

　　All major rivers in the country have now entered the flood season, and people in riverbank areas are nervously preparing for flood control.

　　Large administrative regions such as East China and Northeast China, as well as provinces such as Hebei in North China, and water conservancy departments of major rivers such as the Huai River and the Yellow River have successively held flood control work conferences and established flood control organizations. Due to the earlier flood season in various rivers in the Central South Region this year, the region's flood control headquarters was established as early as April 19th, and the flood control headquarters of various provinces in the region were also established successively in late April and early May. The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters held a joint meeting of the flood control departments of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces in mid-June to specifically deploy the Yellow River flood control work. At the Huai River flood control conference held in mid-June, the Huai River Management Commission criticized some cadres and the masses for their somewhat paralyzed thinking regarding flood control work.

　　This year, flood control organizations in various regions have attached great importance to inspecting dikes and culverts. Yellow River dike protection personnel have adopted a steel wire probing method this year to inspect the Yellow River dikes, eliminating many loopholes. In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and along the Han River in Hubei Province, more than 100,000 farmers participated in the work of inspecting the Yangtze River and Han River dikes. In the riverbank areas of Hebei Province, special personnel have been designated to manage each area and section this year. An'ci County in the province alone has organized more than 2,820 people to participate in the rescue teams, with more than 5,000 reserve team members. Many prefectural offices and county and district cadres in the river areas along the Yangtze River in southern Anhui and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have begun working on the dikes, with dike protection personnel patrolling the dikes day and night. Wherever loopholes or unstable dikes are discovered, they are immediately reinforced and repaired. For example, after completing the annual maintenance projects of various rivers this spring, Hubei Province also reinforced about 1.3 million cubic meters of earth on the dikes.

　　In terms of flood control work, the Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Central Ministry of Water Resources have devoted great efforts to organizing this work. In addition to establishing flood reporting stations along various rivers, rainfall stations have also been added in the mountainous areas, which are the main sources of floods. Up to now, a total of 612 flood reporting stations and rainfall stations have been established nationwide, including more than 60 dedicated flood reporting radio stations, with 127 stations reporting directly to the Central Flood Control Headquarters. The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has given great support in the process of establishing the flood reporting network. Postal and telecommunications agencies in East China and North China have also set up special training classes to train specialized personnel in taking and sending flood reporting telegrams. All of this has created favorable conditions for this year's flood control work.

　　In addition, in some areas where drought has occurred this year, the people's governments have paid considerable attention to combining leading the masses in drought resistance with flood control work. For example, there is currently a drought in northern Anhui Province. When convening the flood control conference, the region established a flood control and drought resistance headquarters to unify flood control and drought resistance work. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 全国各河沿岸地区人民紧张准备防汛

　　全国各河沿岸地区人民紧张准备防汛
    全国各主要河流现已进入汛期，各河沿岸地区人民正在紧张准备防汛。
    华东、东北等大行政区及华北的河北等省，以及淮河、黄河等主要河流的水利机关均已先后召开防汛工作会议，成立了防汛组织。中南区因今年各河汛期较早，该区防汛总指挥部早在四月十九日即告成立，该区各省的防汛指挥部亦相继在四月底五月初成立。黄河防汛总指挥部曾在六月中旬召开河南、平原、山东三省防汛联席会议，具体布置黄河的防汛工作。治淮委员会在六月中旬召开的淮河防汛会议上，曾批判了部分干部和群众对淮河防汛工作的若干麻痹思想。
    各地防汛组织今年都极重视检查堤防和涵洞。黄河护堤人员今年采用钢丝探钻的方法检查黄河大堤，消灭了许多漏洞。湖北省长江中游和汉水两岸，曾有十多万农民参加检查长江和汉水堤防的工作。河北省沿河地区，今年均分区、分段指定专人专管。仅该省安次县现已组织好了二千八百二十多人参加抢险队，并有后备队员五千多人。皖南沿江河地区及长江中、下游沿岸的许多专署及县、区干部现已开始上堤办公，日夜均有护堤人员在堤上巡逻。各地发现漏洞或堤防不坚固，都立即加以培修。如湖北省今春在完成各河的岁修工程后又培修堤防约一百三十多万公方土。
    在防汛工作方面，中央防汛总指挥部及中央水利部都曾用很大的力量组织这一工作。各地除已在各河流沿岸建立报汛站外，并在洪水主要来源的山区加设了雨量站。到现在止，全国已共设立报汛站、雨量站六百一十二处，其中专设的报汛电台有六十多处，直接向中央防汛总指挥部报汛的有一百二十七处。在建立报汛网过程中，中央邮电部曾给予大力支持。华东、华北等地的邮电机构并曾专设训练班，训练拍发报汛电报的专门人员。这一切，都为今年的防汛工作创造了有利的条件。
    此外，今年部分发生旱象的地区，人民政府均相当注意了领导群众抗旱与防汛工作相结合的问题。如皖北区目前有干旱现象，该区在召开防汛会议时，即成立了防汛抗旱指挥部，以便把防汛和抗旱工作统一起来。（新华社）
