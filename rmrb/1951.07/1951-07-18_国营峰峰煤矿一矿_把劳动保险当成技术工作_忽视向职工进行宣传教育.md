State-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine No. 1
　  Treats Labor Insurance as Technical Work
　  Neglects Propaganda and Education for Employees

To the Editor:
    The Party committee, administration, and trade union of the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine No. 1 neglect propaganda and education work among employees regarding the Labor Insurance Regulations. From April 20th to May 15th, the mine conducted card registration and review work for labor insurance. After inspection, only 69 percent of the mine's long-term workers were qualified to enjoy labor insurance benefits. However, workers generally have a poor understanding of the principles of labor insurance. In late May, the Fengfeng State-owned Coal Mine Party Committee and the Coal Mine Trade Union inspected this work. The inspection was targeted at 32 mechanical and electrical workers and the coal miners of the Fourth Squad. These workers were considered by Mine No. 1 to have a relatively good understanding of the significance of labor insurance. We gave them five extremely simple test questions. Among the 25 people from the Fourth Squad who participated in the test, 12 people did not answer a single question correctly. The others gave very vague answers. For example, when asked: "What are the benefits of labor insurance for workers?" Many workers said, "I don't know!" Worker Liu Gen said: "I just do what everyone else does!" When asked: "How is labor insurance obtained?" Some said: "It is earned through labor." When asked again, "Why couldn't labor obtain it in the past?" they couldn't answer. When asked if implementing labor insurance was good or not, some workers said, "Implementing it is better than not implementing it." Some trade union cadres didn't even know the difference in labor insurance benefits between members and non-members. When exposing elements who should not be entitled to labor insurance benefits, some workers were afraid of offending people, remained completely ignorant, and failed to draw clear lines.
    Why did this problem occur? Because the Party leadership of Mine No. 1 did not pay attention to this work. The Party and administration believed this was the trade union's business; the trade union believed it was a technical job, to just complete the registration, and did not carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education for the employees. They did not carefully study the instructions of the mine area Party committee on implementing the Labor Insurance Regulations. They do not understand, or do not fully understand, that the Labor Insurance Regulations were won by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, through thirty years of bloodshed and sacrifice, and that this is a major event for the working class. They have set the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations against the current production work.

### 国营峰峰煤矿一矿  把劳动保险当成技术工作  忽视向职工进行宣传教育

　　国营峰峰煤矿一矿
　  把劳动保险当成技术工作
　  忽视向职工进行宣传教育编辑同志：
    国营峰峰煤矿一矿党委、行政和工会，忽视对职工进行关于劳动保险条例的宣传教育工作。该矿从四月二十日到五月十五日，进行劳动保险的卡片登记，审查工作。经检查合格，开始享受劳动保险待遇的职工占矿里长期工人的百分之六十九。但是工人对劳动保险的道理却普遍地认识不清。峰峰国营煤矿党委和煤矿工会，在五月下旬对这个工作进行了检查。检查的对象是三十二个机电工和第四小队的煤矿工人。这些工人是一矿认为对劳动保险的意义认识比较好的。我们出了极简单的五个测验题。第四小队工人参加测验的二十五个人中，有十二个人一道题也未答对。别的人答的都很糊涂。比如问：劳动保险对工人有什么好处？不少工人说：“不知道”！工人刘根说：“人家怎样，我也怎样！”问：劳动保险是怎样得到的？有的说：“是劳动得来的”。再问过去劳动为什么得不来呢？就说不上来了。当问到实行劳动保险好不好时，有的工人说：“实行比不实行强。”有的工会干部，还不知道会员和非会员在享受劳动保险待遇上有什么不同。在检举不应享受劳动保险待遇的分子时，有的工人还怕得罪人，一问三不知，没有划清界线。
    为什么发生这样的问题呢？因为一矿党的领导上，没有注意这个工作，党与行政方面认为这是工会的事情；工会认为这是个技术工作，登记一下就完了，未广泛深入地对职工进行宣传教育。矿区党委关于贯彻劳动保险条例的指示，他们没有仔细研究。他们不了解或不十分了解劳动保险条例是工人阶级在共产党的领导下，经过三十年流血牺牲换来的，这是工人阶级的大事情。他们把执行劳动保险条例和当前的生产工作对立起来了。
