Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th: Soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are resisting the enemy's northern invasion in the Tieyuan and Jinhua areas, are still taking time out of their busy battle schedule to help local Korean farmers plant rice seedlings and raise silkworms. June is the busy farming season in Korea; the rice seedlings have grown tall, and the silkworms are about to spin their cocoons. However, due to the invading bandits' reckless northward advance, local farmers were forced to temporarily leave their homes threatened by enemy fire. The volunteer army unit stationed in this area, responsible for blocking the enemy, organized some soldiers to plant rice seedlings for the farmers. They took a day off, planting from 4:00 PM until night, planting all the rice paddies in the area where they were stationed. Many silkworms were also left in the farmers' homes. The unit's guards and cooks automatically collected mulberry leaves to feed the silkworms. Fearing that they might have to move, they specifically wrote a note and posted it on the wall, which read: "Comrades who camp here, please continue to pick mulberry leaves and feed the silkworms." A week later, most of the silkworms had spun their cocoons. The villagers who returned successively, seeing that the fields had been planted with rice seedlings and the silkworms in their homes had spun cocoons, were so happy that they grabbed the soldiers' hands and could not speak.

　　我志愿军在铁原、金化地区
    协助朝鲜农民插秧喂蚕
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】在铁原、金化地区抗击北犯敌军的中国人民志愿军某部的战士们，虽然在紧张的战斗情况下，仍然抽空帮助当地朝鲜农民插秧、喂蚕。六月正是朝鲜农忙季节，秧苗已经长大，蚕也快做茧了。但是由于侵略匪徒冒险北窜，当地农民们被迫暂时离开了受到敌人炮火威胁的家园。在这一地区担任阻击敌人的志愿军某部，便组织了一些战士代农民们插秧。他们抽了一天时间，从下午四点钟一直插到夜晚，将驻地没有插秧的稻田全部插好。农民家里还留下了不少的蚕。该部的警卫员、炊事员们都自动采了桑叶来喂蚕。他们怕自己可能移动，特地写了纸条贴在墙上，上面写着：“请到此宿营的同志继续采桑喂蚕。”一个星期以后，大部分蚕都做了茧。陆续回来的老乡们，看到田里插上了秧，家里的蚕也做了茧，高兴得拉着战士们的手说不出话来。
