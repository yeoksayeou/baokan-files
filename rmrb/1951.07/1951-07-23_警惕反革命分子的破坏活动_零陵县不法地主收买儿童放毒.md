　　Beware of Counter-Revolutionary Sabotage
　　Unlawful Landlords in Lingling County Bribe Children to Spread Poison
    Unlawful landlords in Lingling County, Hunan Province, have been found by the government to be bribing children to spread poison in various places. Lei Qiufang, an unlawful landlord in Huaqiao Township, has consistently taken an antagonistic stance during the land reform movement in the township. After the land reform in the township ended, he secretly bribed forty children to spread poison in Lingling, Dong'an, Shaoyang, and other counties. On May 29th, Tang Darong, a farmer from Lingkou Township in Lingling, caught a child named Wu Jiuxiang (who lives in Huaqiao Township and is only thirteen years old this year) spreading poison. The child said: "On May 28th, Lei Qiufang invited several of us children to his house for dinner and gave us some money. Finally, he gave us a packet of medicine and told us to put the medicine in wells or ponds."
    After the Second District People's Government of this county learned of this matter, it immediately arrested Lei Qiufang and found a bottle of poison in his home. The local masses are extremely indignant about this matter and have demanded that the government severely punish him according to the law. They have also expressed that they will heighten their vigilance, strengthen control over unlawful landlords, and prevent their conspiracies.

　　警惕反革命分子的破坏活动
　  零陵县不法地主收买儿童放毒
    湖南省零陵县不法地主收买儿童到各地放毒，已被政府查获。该县花桥乡不法地主雷秋芳，在该乡土地改革运动中，一贯采取对抗态度。该乡土地改革结束后，他竟秘密收买四十名儿童，到零陵、东安、邵阳等县放毒。五月二十九日，零陵凌口乡农民唐大荣捉住了一个放毒的孩子吴九香（家住花桥乡，今年才十三岁）。那孩子说：“五月二十八日，雷秋芳请我们几个孩子到他家吃饭，还给了我们一些钱。最后他给我们一包药，叫我们把药放到井里或塘里去。”
    本县二区人民政府知道此事后，马上把雷秋芳逮捕起来，并从他家搜出毒药一瓶。当地群众对此事极为愤恨，纷纷要求政府严予法办；并表示要提高警惕，加强对不法地主的管制，防止他们的阴谋活动。
