　　As the people of the whole country warmly celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, this reporter visited a heroic company with a similarly long history from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army – the Iron Red Second Company.
　　The predecessor of the Red Second Company was the peasant self-defense army led by Chairman Mao during the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan in September 1927. After the failure of the uprising, Chairman Mao took this peasant armed force to Jinggang Mountain and formally reorganized it into the Second Company of the First Regiment of the First Division of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Since then, for twenty-four years, this company has always maintained the glorious designation of "Red Second Company."
　　During the anti-encirclement and suppression campaigns of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Red Second Company was always a main force company. It established many meritorious services. During the Long March, the Red Second Company belonged to the Fourth Regiment of the Second Division of the First Army Group of the Red Army, commanded by General Lin Biao, and was the vanguard on the Long March. When crossing the natural barrier of the Wu River in central Guizhou, the first to try to cross by bamboo raft were Company Commander Mao of the Red Second Company and five heroes. The entire Red Second Company later participated in the large-scale forced crossing, breaking through the Wu River's natural barrier. The twenty-four heroes who seized the Luding Bridge over the Dadu River also came from the Red Second Company. Under the cover of the entire regiment's artillery fire, led by Company Commander Liao Dazhu, they braved the enemy's dense fire, climbed the bare iron chains, and climbed to the bridgehead on the opposite bank. Then they rushed through the fire set by the enemy on the city wall, repelled the enemy guarding the bridge, and rushed into Luding City, opening a bloody path for the main force behind, ensuring the safe passage of the entire army across the Dadu River.
　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the Red Second Company belonged to the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army and participated in the famous Battle of Pingxingguan. With courageous actions, the Red Second Company detoured to the flanks and rear of the Japanese invaders, seized the commanding heights, defeated the repeated counterattacks of the Japanese invaders, killed and wounded seventy-eight Japanese soldiers, and won a brilliant victory. Afterwards, the Red Second Company followed the 115th Division into the enemy's rear, fought in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, severely打击打击打j击 the Japanese invaders and puppet troops, and recovered large areas of territory. In 1938, the Red Second Company annihilated more than 80 Japanese invaders at the cost of only five casualties in a battle. In the ambush at Wucheng Town, the Red Second Company annihilated more than 60 Japanese invaders, without a single casualty of their own. On August 6, 1939, in the Weiwu battle in eastern Anhui, the Red Second Company killed and wounded more than 70 enemies and captured five light and heavy machine guns and three grenade launchers. Due to this series of victories, the Red Second Company became the first elite company in the entire division to possess Japanese equipment.
　　In October 1943, the Red Second Company attacked the enemy at Linqiao in Huaiyin and engaged in a bayonet fight with more than 100 Japanese invaders. Yang Kongsheng, the deputy squad leader of the first squad, stabbed three Japanese soldiers to death alone, and he himself was seriously injured. Deputy squad leader Wang Chengyin was stabbed to the ground by three Japanese soldiers, covered in blood. The Japanese thought he was dead, but as soon as they turned around, Wang Chengyin jumped up from the ground and shouted: "Where are you running!" He pounced on the enemy like a fierce lion. The enemies were caught off guard and were all stabbed down by him. As a result of this fierce battle, the entire Red Second Company stabbed more than 50 Japanese soldiers to death and uprooted the stronghold of Linqiao.
　　On the eve of the Japanese surrender, the Red Second Company and its fraternal troops went north together to cooperate with the Soviet Red Army in liberating Northeast China. Later, when the Kuomintang reactionaries invaded the Northeast Liberated Area, the Red Second Company repeatedly performed outstanding feats to protect the interests of the people of Northeast China. In May 1946, the Red Second Company was the first to respond to General Lin Biao's call to "create the bayonet tactics" and launched a mobile attack in Botou. Wang Xuehong, the third platoon leader and combat hero of the company, led the entire platoon straight into the heart of the defense zone of a certain unit of the Kuomintang army's New First Army, annihilated the enemy's company headquarters, killed a deputy battalion commander, captured more than 30 enemies, and victoriously broke through the encirclement before dawn, returning to his original unit without a single casualty.
　　In the winter of 1946, the main force of the Northeast People's Liberation Army crossed the Songhua River for the second time to encircle the enemy in the Jiaojialing area. The Red Second Company was assigned the main attack task. In the severe cold of minus forty degrees, they launched fierce and repeated assaults on the Kuomintang army in Jiaojialing. Although only eight people were left in the entire company at the end, they finally cooperated with their fraternal units to take Jiaojialing and annihilate the entire 150th Regiment of the New First Army, the elite main force of the Kuomintang bandit army known as the "World's First Army." The indomitable and tenacious fighting style of the Red Second Company was commended in a circular order by General Lin Biao.
　　In October 1948, during the last battle to liberate the entire Northeast – the Liaoxi Campaign – the Red Second Company created even more unparalleled heroic achievements. The Kuomintang army's Liao Yaoxiang Corps, which had fled from Shenyang, fled to the area of ​​Heishan and Dahushan. After hearing that Jinzhou had been liberated, they immediately changed direction, wanting to escape by sea via Yingkou. Just as they were turning back, they were suddenly stopped head-on by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. In order to resolutely hold the enemy in place and wait for the armies to converge to destroy them, this part of the People's Liberation Army launched an active attack on the enemy entrenched in the Lijiawopeng and Yaojiawopeng line, regardless of the unfavorable conditions of being outnumbered. The Red Second Company was responsible for attacking the enemy at Yaojiawopeng. Their third squad penetrated into the street of Yaojiawopeng, which was guarded by an enemy battalion, and cut the enemy in half. In order to remove this sharp knife inserted into their chest, the enemy concentrated their forces and firepower and launched continuous counterattacks. The sharp knife squad eventually had only five comrades left, but they were still fighting bravely. Chi Yuxin, the squad leader of the third squad, shouted: "Comrades! Don't forget that we are the Red Second Company that came down from Jinggang Mountain, the company personally led by Chairman Mao! ... Charge!" Deng Zhanshan, a hero who had applied to join the Communist Party before the war, had four fingers shot off and was wounded in his right leg. He stumbled many times, but still got up and charged. Later, when both of his legs were broken, he crawled forward to an enemy courtyard, bit open the grenade cover with his teeth, and threw grenades one after another into the courtyard with his left hand, blasting the enemy in the courtyard to screams. When the enemy at Yaojiawopeng collapsed and fled, Meng Xianzhang, the instructor of the Red Second Company, led the heroic second platoon to pursue the fleeing enemy, chasing them all the way to Tiejiapeng, where they engaged in a bayonet fight with an enemy ten times their size. After stabbing more than 30 enemies to death, this platoon also sacrificed heroically due to the disparity in numbers. But in the face of the heroic company, no matter what enemy could not escape. The Red Second Company organized the last two squads, led by Xue Congshan, the third platoon leader, and launched a brave attack, cooperating with the neighboring units to pursue the fleeing enemy, holding them in place until all our armies arrived and annihilated the enemy. After the Liaoxi Battle, the Red Second Company was awarded the honorary title of "Iron Company" by the division headquarters and collectively received three major commendations.
　　In 1949, the Red Second Company participated in the battles to liberate North China and Central South China. In April 1950, the Red Second Company secretly crossed the Qiongya Strait, landed on Hainan Island, and fought with the enemy on the island for eighteen days and nights, finally joining forces with the main force that had landed by force to liberate Haikou City. During the liberation of the Central South continent, the entire company produced 167 people's heroes.
　　This red and heroic company, from its founding on Jinggang Mountain by Chairman Mao himself in 1927 to the present, has fought all over the country for 24 years and made immortal contributions to the people and the motherland. Their entire history of heroic struggle is an epitome of the history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a victorious record of Chairman Mao's military genius, and a brilliant crystallization condensed from the flesh and blood of the heroic and hardworking Chinese people. Their glorious achievements will forever coexist and flourish with our great people's motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    当全国人民热烈庆祝人民解放军建军二十四周年的时候，记者访问了解放军某部一个具有同样悠久历史的英雄连队——钢铁红二连。
    红二连的前身，是一九二七年九月毛主席领导湖南农民秋收起义时的农民自卫军。起义失败以后，毛主席将这支农民武装带上了井岗山，正式改编为工农红军第一军第一师第二连。从那以后，二十四年来，这支连队始终保持着“红色第二连”的光荣番号。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期的反围攻战争中，红二连一直是一个主力连队。它树立了不少功勋。在长征时期，红二连隶属于林彪将军指挥的红军第一军团第二师第四团，是长征途中的开路先锋。在强渡贵州中部的天险乌江的时候，首先乘着竹筏试行偷渡的，就是红二连的毛连长和五位英雄。红二连全连后来也参加了大规模的强渡，突破了乌江天险。夺取大渡河上的泸定桥的二十四位英雄，也是出在红二连里。他们在全团炮火掩护下，由连长廖大珠率领着，冒着敌人密集的火力，攀着光秃的铁索，爬到对岸桥头。接着他们冲过敌人在城头放起的大火，将守桥的敌人击退，冲进泸定城，替后面的主力杀开了一条血路，保证全军安全渡过大渡河。
    在抗日战争时期，红二连隶属于八路军一一五师，参加了名震中外的平型关大战。红二连以勇猛的动作，抄到日寇侧后，夺取了制高点，打垮了日寇的一再反扑，杀伤鬼子七十八名，获得了辉煌胜利。之后，红二连随着一一五师向敌后开进，转战苏、鲁、豫、皖四省，沉重地打击了日寇和伪军，收复了大片国土。一九三八年，红二连在一次战斗中以伤亡五个人的代价，歼灭日寇八十多名。在武城镇伏击战中，红二连再歼日寇六十多名，自己无一伤亡。一九三九年八月六日，皖东韦洼战斗，红二连又毙伤敌七十多名，缴获轻重机枪五挺，掷弹筒三个。由于这一连串的胜利，红二连成为全师最早拥有日式装备的精锐连队。
    一九四三年十月，红二连出击淮阴林桥的敌人，与一百多名日寇进行白刃肉搏战。一班副班长杨孔胜一个人刺死了三个鬼子，自己也负了重伤。副班长王成银被三个鬼子刺倒在地，满身流血。鬼子以为他死了，刚一回头，王成银便从地上跳起，大喊：“往那里跑！”就像猛狮似地扑向敌人。敌人猝不及防，都被他刺倒。这一场恶战的结果，红二连全连共刺杀了五十多个鬼子，拔除了林桥这一据点。
    日寇投降前夕，红二连又和兄弟部队一起北上，配合苏联红军解放了东北。后来国民党反动派进犯东北解放区，红二连又为保卫东北人民的利益而屡建奇功。一九四六年五月，红二连首先响应林彪将军的“创造尖刀战术”的号召，在泊头机动出击。该连战斗英雄三排长王学洪，率领全排直插国民党军新一军某部防区的心脏，歼灭了敌人的一个连部，击毙了一个副营长，俘敌三十多人，到拂晓时胜利突出重围，归还原部，自己无一伤亡。
    一九四六年冬，北满的解放军主力二下松花江南，包围了焦家岭地区的敌人，红二连担任了主攻任务。他们在零下四十度的严寒里，向焦家岭的国民党军开始了猛烈的反复冲锋。全连最后虽然只剩下了八个人，但终于配合兄弟部队打下了焦家岭，将号称“天下第一军”的国民党匪军精锐主力新一军的一五零团全部歼灭。红二连的这种百折不挠的顽强战斗作风，曾得到林彪将军的通令表扬。
    一九四八年十月，在解放全东北的最后一个战役——辽西会战中，红二连更创造了无比的英雄伟绩。从沈阳逃出来的国民党军廖耀湘兵团，逃到了黑山、打虎山一带，听说锦州已被解放，就马上调转方向，想经由营口从海上逃走。正当他们掉头回窜之时，突然被解放军某部迎头拦住。这一部分解放军为了坚决拖住敌人，等候各路大军会合来消灭他们，所以不顾敌众我寡的不利条件，向据守厉家窝棚，腰家窝棚一线之敌发起了主动的攻击。红二连担任攻击腰家窝棚之敌。他们的第三班，竟插入到有敌人一个营据守着的腰家窝棚的街里，把敌人拦腰切为两段。敌人为了拔除这一把插到他们胸中的尖刀，集中兵力和火力，举行了不断的反击。尖刀班最后还剩下五个同志，但他们仍然奋战着。第三班班长迟玉新高呼说：“同志们！别忘了咱们是井岗山上下来的红二连，是毛主席亲自带领过的连队！……冲上去！”在战前曾经申请加入共产党的英雄邓占山，被打掉了四个手指头，右腿也负了伤，跌了很多跟斗，仍然爬起来冲锋。后来他的两条腿都被打断了，他就爬着前进到敌人的一座大院跟前，用牙齿咬开手榴弹盖，以左手接二连三地向院中猛掷，炸得院里的敌人鬼哭狼嚎。腰家窝棚的敌人不支而逃时，红二连的指导员孟宪章率领了英勇的第二排猛追逃敌，直追到铁家窝棚，与十倍于己的敌人展开了白刃战。在刺死敌人三十多名后，这一个排也因众寡悬殊，全部壮烈牺牲。但在英雄连队的面前，不管什么敌人都是逃不脱的。红二连又组织了最后的两个班，在三排长薛从善率领下，勇猛出击，配合友邻部队，穷追逃敌，将敌拖住，直到我各路大军一齐赶到，将敌全部歼灭为止。辽西大战以后，红二连荣获师部授予的“钢铁连”的光荣称号，并集体立了三个大功。
    一九四九年，红二连参加了解放华北、中南的各次战役。一九五零年四月，红二连潜渡琼崖海峡，登陆海南岛，在岛上与敌人转战十八昼夜，最后与强渡登陆的大军会合，解放海口市。在解放中南大陆的过程中，全连出现了一百六十七名人民功臣。
    这一支红色的英雄连队，从一九二七年在井岗山上由毛主席亲手创立到现在，二十四年来转战全国，为人民为祖国立下了不朽的功绩。他们英勇奋战的全部历史，是中国人民解放军历史的一部缩影，是毛主席军事天才的胜利纪录，是英勇勤劳的中国人民血肉凝成的灿烂结晶。他们的辉煌功绩将与我们伟大的人民祖国永存并茂。      （新华社）
