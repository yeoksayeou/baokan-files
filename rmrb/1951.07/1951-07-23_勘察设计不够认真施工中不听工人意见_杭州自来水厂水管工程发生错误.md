　  Careless Surveying and Design, Ignoring Workers' Opinions During Construction
　  Errors Occur in Hangzhou Waterworks Water Pipe Project
    The Hangzhou Waterworks had an insufficiently serious and conscientious attitude towards basic construction. During the laying of the Fuxing Road water pipe project in April of this year, due to careless and sloppy surveying and design before construction, errors occurred in the project, wasting national resources.
    The project was overseen by Li Tong, section chief of the Waterworks, and preparations for all pipe laying work began at the end of March this year. Construction started in April and was completed in May. The total project budget was 731.2 million yuan. The water pipe project was approximately 2,750 meters long. Before the start of the project, no detailed survey was conducted, and there was no close communication with the Construction Bureau. They only inquired about the road surface height from the Construction Bureau by telephone and made the design based on that. The Construction Bureau stated that the designed road surface height was 20 centimeters, and Li Tong, the section chief, assumed that the old road surface would be uniformly raised by 20 centimeters. He did not further understand that when reconstructing the new road, the old road surface had to be excavated where it was high and filled where it was low to appropriately level it. Therefore, he decided to bury the water pipes 80 centimeters below the old road surface, blindly proceeding with construction. When the Construction Bureau leveled the road surface, it was discovered that some water pipes were exposed above the ground. They had to re-bury 270 meters of water pipe, and the entire line also required an additional 674 cubic meters of earthwork, resulting in a loss of 3.3 million yuan. The Waterworks incurred an additional 64 workdays, resulting in a loss of 1.6 million yuan. The total loss of people's property amounted to 4.9 million yuan. During the construction process, when workers discovered errors in the project, they also raised opinions, believing that horizontal measurements were necessary. However, this correct opinion was not well considered and adopted by Li Tong, the section chief. During the construction process, although the longitudinal section drawings of the Fuxing Road design constructed by the Construction Bureau were obtained, they were not studied carefully. They only looked at the height difference of the water outlets and continued construction based on subjective wishes. During the project, Li Tong, the section chief, did not frequently inspect the work site to exchange opinions with everyone, but only occasionally looked at it along the way. When the errors in the project were discovered, Li Tong, the section chief, did not conduct timely research, report the situation to higher authorities, or correct the errors in a timely manner.
    The leadership of the Hangzhou Waterworks, in order to complete the task quickly, entrusted the project to Li Tong, the section chief, for full management, without conducting necessary inspections and supervision. When the Construction Bureau discovered the errors in the pipe laying project during road construction, they still did not pay enough attention to it and emphasized the difficulty of re-burying the water pipes, refusing to modify it. They did not compare and consider the costs of modifying the pipes versus modifying the road. It was not until the Construction Bureau pointed it out that they conducted an inspection and realized the seriousness of the project errors.
    The Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau held a meeting on July 4th to review the situation, analyze the root causes of the errors in the buried water pipe project, and pointed out that the errors were mainly caused by the irresponsible and careless work style of the personnel in charge of the project, the lack of a high sense of responsibility to the people, and the mindset of being hired labor. The meeting decided on the handling methods for this issue, pointing out that the leading cadres of the Hangzhou Waterworks must promptly improve the system and, according to the principles and spirit of engineering design proposed by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government and the People's Daily, sort out the city's water pipeline network and set up a drafting room to cooperate with the Hangzhou urban construction plan. The Construction Bureau should do its best to help solve difficulties in the future. The workers were able to discover problems and raise opinions during the construction process of this project, which is commendable. Workers should strengthen supervision of projects and adhere to their correct opinions in the future. The Construction Bureau will strengthen the leadership of its affiliated units, implement an inspection system, and use this lesson to educate all staff members, strengthen their sense of responsibility, and cherish the concept of national property.

### 勘察设计不够认真施工中不听工人意见  杭州自来水厂水管工程发生错误

　  勘察设计不够认真施工中不听工人意见
　  杭州自来水厂水管工程发生错误
    杭州市自来水厂对待基本建设的态度不够严肃认真，在今年四月间埋置复兴路水管工程时，由于施工前的勘察、设计马虎草率，以致工程发生错误，浪费国家资材。
    该工程由自来水厂李通课长主持，于本年三月底开始准备一切埋管工作，四月开工，五月完成。全部工程预算为七亿三千一百二十万元。该项水管工程全长约二千七百五十公尺。工程开工之前，既未进行详细勘察，又未与建设局密切联系，只用电话向建设局询问了一下路面高度就做出设计。建设局说路面设计高度为二十公分，李通课长就以为是按照老路面一律加高二十公分，而没有进一步了解在改筑新路时必须把老路面高挖低填，适当铺平，于是决定在老路面下的八十公分处埋置水管，盲目施工。待建设局铺平路面时，发现有些水管露出地面，只好把二百七十公尺水管重新改埋，全线也加了土方六百七十四公方，损失三百三十万元；自来水厂多费六十四个工，损失一百六十万元。合计损失人民资财四百九十万元。在施工过程中，工人发觉工程错误时，也曾提出意见，认为需要进行水平测量。但是，这个正确意见却没有被李通课长很好地考虑采纳。在施工过程中，虽曾取得建设局兴建复兴路设计的纵断面图，但却未加研究，只是看了看出水口的高差，仍凭主观愿望，继续施工。在工程进行中，李通课长也没有经常到工地检查工作，与大家交换意见，只是有时到工地沿途一看了之。工程的错误已经被发现时，李通课长也没有及时进行研究，向上级反映情况，及时改正错误。
    杭州市自来水厂领导方面，为了赶紧完成任务，将工程交李通课长全权处理，没有进行必要的检查督促。当建设局筑路兴工时发觉该项埋管工程错误之后，仍未十分重视，还强调改埋水管困难，不肯改装，没有从改管与改路两项工程费用多少去比较考虑。直到建设局指出后，才进行了检查，认识到工程错误的严重。
    杭州市人民政府建设局为此已于七月四日召开会议进行检讨，分析了埋置水管工程的错误根源，指出错误的产生主要是负责工程人员在工作中有粗枝大叶不负责任的不良作风，缺乏高度的对人民负责的观念，还有雇佣观点。会议决定了对这个问题的处理办法，指出杭州市自来水厂领导干部，必须从速健全制度，根据中央人民政府财政经济委员会和人民日报提出的关于工程设计的原则和精神，把全市自来水管线路网清理出来，并设置绘图室，以配合杭州市都市建设计划。建设局今后应尽力帮助解决困难。工人在这次工程施工过程中，能够发现问题，提出意见，这是值得表扬的。工人们今后应该加强对工程的监督，并坚持自己的正确意见。建设局将加强对所属单位的领导，贯彻检查制度，用这次教训教育全体工作人员，加强他们的责任心和爱护国家财产的观念。
