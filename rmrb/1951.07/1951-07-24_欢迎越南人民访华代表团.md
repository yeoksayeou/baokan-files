　　Welcome the Delegation of the Vietnamese People to China
    The delegation of the Vietnamese people to China arrived in Beijing yesterday. The Chinese people extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the Vietnamese people who are waging a victorious struggle against U.S. and French imperialism.
    The Vietnamese people are a heroic people. In the great struggle for the independence and liberation of the Vietnamese nation, the Vietnamese people have achieved great victories. The heinous plans of U.S. and French imperialism to re-conquer the Vietnamese people have met with shameful failure. Especially since the great victory in northern Vietnam last autumn, the Vietnamese People's Army has gradually gained the initiative in the war, and the French colonial army can only be confined to a few large cities along the coast. After the establishment of the Vietnam Workers' Party in February this year, and the merger of the Vietnam Independence League and the Vietnam National United Front into the Vietnam National United Front in March this year, the Vietnamese people's national liberation struggle has had stronger leadership, and the patriotic strata in the country have had broader and closer unity. Under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are advancing steadily on the road to victory. The victorious development of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an important contribution to the cause of peace and democracy in Asia.
    China and Vietnam are adjacent to each other, and the people of the two countries have a long history of friendship. This friendship has been greatly consolidated in the struggle of the people of the two countries against imperialism. The People's Republic of China expresses warm sympathy for the just cause of the Vietnamese people and was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the future, in order to continue to oppose imperialist aggression, defend peace in Asia, and build their own countries, the people of the two countries need to continue to strengthen the fraternal friendship and unity between the people of the two countries. This is also the mission of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China.
    We are convinced that the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China will successfully complete their mission. We wish the Vietnamese People's Delegation to China success.

　　欢迎越南人民访华代表团
    越南人民访华代表团已于昨日到达了北京。中国人民对与美、法帝国主义进行着胜利斗争的越南人民的代表们，表示热烈的欢迎。
    越南人民是英勇的人民。在争取越南民族独立和解放的伟大斗争中，越南人民已取得了伟大的胜利。美、法帝国主义企图重新征服越南人民的罪恶计划，已遭到可耻的失败。尤其是去年秋季越北大胜以来，越南人民军已逐渐取得了战争的主动权，法国殖民军只能困守在沿海少数的大城市中。今年二月间越南劳动党的成立，以及今年三月间越南独立同盟与越南国民联合会合并成为越南民族联合阵线之后，越南人民的民族解放斗争已有了更坚强的领导，国内各爱国阶层也有了更广泛和更亲密的团结。在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的正确领导下，越南人民正在胜利的道路上稳步前进。越南民主共和国的胜利发展，对于亚洲和平民主事业是一个重要的贡献。
    中国和越南国土毗连，两国人民在历史上有悠久的友谊，这种友谊，在两国人民反帝国主义的斗争中是大大地巩固起来了。中华人民共和国对于越南人民的正义事业表示热烈的同情，并且首先与越南民主共和国建立了外交关系。在今后，两国人民为了继续反对帝国主义侵略，保卫亚洲的和平，为了建设自己的国家，需要继续加强两国人民的兄弟般的友好团结。而这也正是越南人民访华代表团的使命。
    我们深信越南人民访华团必能胜利地完成他们的使命。敬祝越南人民访华团的成功。
