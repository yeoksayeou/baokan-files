Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: According to TASS, a celebration of Soviet Aviation Day was held at the Tushino Airfield in Moscow on July 8th. (Note: The Aviation Day celebration was originally scheduled for July 1st, but was postponed to the 8th due to bad weather.) The Tushino airfield was filled with a festive atmosphere. Giant red flags and Soviet Air Force banners were displayed everywhere. Early in the morning, hundreds of thousands of Moscow residents flocked to the airfield, waiting to see the spectacular performance of the "Stalin's Eagles."

At 12:00 noon, Marshal Stalin and the leaders of the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party stepped onto the reviewing stand, and cheers rose to the sky above the airfield. To the sound of the Soviet national anthem, one hundred cannons fired a twenty-gun salute, announcing the start of the Air Force parade. Air Force General Zhigarev served as the commander-in-chief.

Millions of eyes looked up to the sky, and a large formation of aircraft could be seen flying in from afar. Flying at the front was a group of aircraft piloted by amateur pilots. A large flag with a portrait of Stalin fluttered on the lead aircraft, and other aircraft flew various flags: some with Air Force banners, some with long flags bearing the slogan "Forward to Communism!", and some with the national flags of the sixteen Soviet republics. Then, a formation of aircraft forming the words "Glory to Stalin" flew over the airfield.

The celebration's performance program was divided into three parts. The first part was a performance by glider pilots from the Soviet Aviation Promotion Association, led by Air Force Lieutenant General Kamanin. Five female pilots, led by Soviet Hero Chicheneva, performed an excellent collective aerobatic flight. Next, twenty-five amateur aviators, led by world record holder Varoshtenko, performed aerobatics, demonstrating various complex maneuvers: sometimes soaring and somersaulting, sometimes spiraling, sometimes flying upside down. Their actions were coordinated, their movements accurate, and their techniques excellent. The Soviet glider pilots are among the best in the world, and they have created half of the official world gliding records.

The second program was a performance by the Soviet Air Force, led by Air Guard Lieutenant General Vasily Stalin. Pilots Fokin and Lapshin each flew a MiG aircraft, demonstrating head-on flying techniques. They performed complex techniques with great precision, such as the "Immelmann turn," inverted flight, "Nesterov loop," "two-turn roll," and "three-turn roll." This was followed by a group of five and another group of nine high-speed fighters performing the same complex stunts. Fighters and bombers designed by famous Soviet aircraft designers also participated in the performance.

The last program of the celebration was parachuting, led by Air Force Lieutenant General Gurbatov. The sky was suddenly filled with countless parachutes. This was followed by a collective delayed parachute opening performance. Soviet parachutists have repeatedly demonstrated their outstanding skills to the world, creating a total of more than sixty kinds of parachuting records. The celebration concluded with a large-scale collective parachuting performance.

The Soviet Aviation Day celebration demonstrated the superb skills and excellent training of Soviet pilots and parachutists.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Soviet newspapers warmly celebrated Soviet Aviation Day on the 8th. According to TASS, Moscow: Soviet newspapers all published Marshal Vasilyevsky, Minister of the Army of the Soviet Union's order celebrating Aviation Day on the front page. The central newspapers published editorials celebrating the festival and articles by famous Soviet military generals. The newspapers published news of Aviation Day celebrations in cities throughout the Soviet Union.

The People's Daily editorial said: Today, the Soviet people celebrate the new achievements of the Soviet Union in developing the Stalin Air Force and strengthening its combat effectiveness with patriotic pride. Thanks to the constant care of the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people have established a first-class air force and trained a large number of outstanding pilots. Soviet Air Force personnel have earned the reputation of being the world's best pilots due to many outstanding flights. During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Air Force annihilated the enemy and won immortal glory for the Soviet people. After the war, the Soviet Air Force played a major role in peaceful construction, and the Soviet Union has taken the world's lead in the use of aircraft in the national economy. The editorial concluded: The Soviet people are full of enthusiasm for peaceful construction, while vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers. The glorious "Stalin's Eagles" are guarding the constructive labor of the Soviet people vigilantly along with the Soviet Army.

The Izvestia editorial pointed out: The Soviet Union steadfastly safeguards the cause of world peace. While the United States Air Force is spreading death and destruction around the world, the Soviet Air Force serves the interests of mankind and actively participates in the construction of the people of the country.

The Communist Youth League Truth Newspaper published an article by Soviet Air Guard Lieutenant General Vasily Stalin. Vasily Stalin said: Soviet pilots were the first in the world to master the art of collective flight of jet aircraft. After the war, many pilots were awarded Soviet medals and awards for their excellent performance in combat training and political education or for mastering flying techniques. In 1950, the "Excellent Pilot" medal was established, and many air force personnel have now received this glorious medal. Vasily Stalin also said: During the post-war period, the Soviet civil aviation fleet has achieved great success. The aviation fleet's pilots and engineers, mechanics and technicians actively participated in the construction of great projects, and pilots participated from the beginning of the engineering construction carried out on the banks of the Volga River, the Dnieper River, and the Don River, and in the Kara-Kum Desert. Vasily Stalin also said: The establishment and development of the Soviet Aviation Promotion Association shows the Soviet people's love for the Soviet air fleet. Tens of thousands of young men and women engage in aviation sports in their spare time and have gained the reputation of the world's best aviation athletes. In the past month alone, the Aviation Sports Committee has approved forty-five new Soviet aviation records and submitted materials for twenty-three of these records to the International Aviation Association for registration as new world records.

　　莫斯科盛大集会庆祝苏联航空节  斯大林检阅强大空军力量
    苏各报评称：苏联已建立了第一流的空军，       
    坚定地维护着世界和平事业。
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：七月八日，在莫斯科土希诺飞机场举行了苏联航空节的庆祝会。（按：航空节庆祝会原定七月一日举行，因天气不好改在八日举行）土希诺机场上一片节日景象。到处招展着巨大的红旗和苏联空军军旗，一清早，成千上万的莫斯科居民就涌到机场，等着看“斯大林之鹰”的精彩表演。
    十二时正，斯大林大元帅和苏联政府及布尔什维克党的领袖们步上检阅台，机场上的欢呼声高入云霄。在苏联国歌声中，一百门大炮齐鸣礼炮二十响，宣布空军大检阅的开始。空军上将日加列夫担任总指挥。
    千万人的眼睛齐望天空，老远可以看到一大队飞机排空而来。飞上前面的是一群由业余飞行员驾驶的飞机，为首的一架飞机上飘扬着一面有斯大林像的大旗，其他的飞机上也飘着各式各样的旗帜：有的是空军军旗、有的是写着“向共产主义前进！”的标语的长旗，有的是苏联十六个加盟共和国的国旗。接着，一个组成“光荣归于斯大林”字样的飞机编队飞过机场上空。
    庆祝会的表演节目分为三部分。第一部分是苏联航空促进协会的滑翔机驾驶员的表演，由空军中将卡马宁领导。以苏联英雄契齐涅娃为首的五位女飞行员表演了出色的集体特技飞行。接着，二十五位业余飞行家在世界纪录保持者伐罗斯田柯的率领下作特技飞行，表演了种种复杂的式样：忽而回翔翻筋斗，忽而螺旋飞行，忽而倒飞，他们的行动协调、动作准确，技术优良。苏联的滑翔飞行员是世界上第一流的，正式的世界滑翔纪录有一半是他们创造的。
    第二个节目是苏联空军的表演，由空中禁卫军中将华西里·斯大林领导。飞行员福金和拉普申各驾一架米高扬式飞机，表演迎面飞行技术。他们十分准确地表演了复杂的技巧：如“英麦蔓转弯”、倒飞、“纳斯特罗夫式回翔”、“两转滚”和“三转滚”。接着是一组五架和另一组九架的高速战斗机表演同样复杂的绝技。著名的苏联飞机设计师所设计的战斗机和轰炸机也参加了这次表演。
    庆祝会的最后一个节目是跳伞，由空军中将郭尔巴托夫领导。天空中顿时密布了无数的降落伞。接着是集体迟缓开伞表演。苏联的跳伞者不止一次地向全世界表现了杰出的技术，他们总共创造了六十多种跳伞纪录。庆祝会最后在大规模的集体跳伞表演中宣告结束。
    苏联航空节的庆祝会显示了苏联飞行员和跳伞家高超的技术和卓越的训练。
    【新华社九日讯】苏联报纸于八日热烈庆祝苏联航空节。据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各报均以首页地位登载了苏联陆军部长华西列夫斯基元帅的庆祝航空节的命令。各中央报纸发表了庆祝节日的社论和苏联著名军事将领的文章。各报刊登了全苏各城市庆祝航空节的消息。
    真理报的社论说：今天，苏联人民带着爱国主义的自豪来庆祝苏联在发展斯大林空军和加强它的战斗力方面的新成就。由于党、政府和斯大林同志的经常关怀，苏联人民已建立了第一流的空军，训练了大量卓越的飞行员。苏联的空军人员由于许多次卓越的飞行，已享有世界上第一流驾驶员的盛名。在伟大的卫国战争期间，苏联空军消灭了敌人，并使苏联人民获得了不朽的光荣。战后，苏联空军又在和平建设方面起着重大的作用，苏联在国民经济中利用飞机方面已居于世界的首位。社论最后说：苏联人民充满着和平建设的热情，同时警惕地注视着帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋。光荣的“斯大林之鹰”正和苏联陆军一道，警觉地保卫着苏联人民的建设性劳动。
    消息报的社论指出：苏联坚定不移地维护着世界和平的事业。正当美国空军向世界散布死亡和破坏的时候，苏联的空军却为人类的利益服务，而且积极参加全国人民的建设事业。
    共青真理报刊载了苏联空中禁卫军中将华西里·斯大林的文章。华西里·斯大林说：苏联的飞行员是世界上最先掌握喷气式飞机集体飞行艺术的。战后许多飞行员因为在战斗训练和政治教育方面成绩优良或掌握了飞行技术而荣获苏联的勋章和奖章。在一九五○年，设立了“优异飞行员”奖章，现在已经有许多空军人员获得了这种光荣的奖章。华西里·斯大林又说：在战后期间，苏联的民用航空队已经获得了巨大的成就。航空队的飞行员和工程师、机械士和技术员积极参加了伟大工程的建筑工作，在伏尔加河、第聂伯河和顿河河岸上以及在卡拉·库姆大沙漠中进行的工程建筑，一开始就有飞行员参加。华西里·斯大林又说：苏联航空促进协会的成立和发展，表明苏联人民对于苏联航空队的热爱。成千成万的男女青年在工余从事航空运动，获得了全世界最好的航空运动家的美名。最近一个月里，航空运动委员会就批准了四十五个全苏航空新纪录，并将其中二十三个纪录的材料寄交国际航空协会，请登记为世界新纪录。
