　　Reap Huge Profits in the War of Aggression Against Korea
　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 27th: A report released last week by the Senate Small Business Committee here reveals that since the beginning of the Korean War, 40 percent of every dollar spent by the U.S. government on massive military orders has been received by ten major companies. Automobile and aircraft companies account for the majority of these ten major companies. General Electric, formerly managed by Wilson, the head of the "Defense Mobilization Agency," is also included. Because the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the company's profits for the first six months of this year increased by 55 percent compared to the first half of last year. The first on the list of the top ten companies is General Motors, which has received $3.5 billion in orders from the Korean massacre. The company achieved the highest amount of net profit ever recorded by a company in a single year last year - over $830 million net after paying all taxes. Ford Motor Company ranks second, with military orders of $1 billion.
　　At a meeting of Local 600 of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), miner leader Lewis sharply criticized the privileged status of General Motors and Ford Motor Company among military profiteers. Lewis warned that a cold war mired in blood and profits would not benefit auto workers. Despite the large number of military orders for auto profiteers, more than 100,000 auto workers are now unemployed in the Detroit area alone, and the speed-up system and rising prices have dispelled the illusion of "full employment" from the military program.

　　美国许多垄断资本企业
　  在侵朝战争中获取暴利
    【新华社二十七日讯】据电通社华盛顿二十四日讯：美国参院小企业委员会上周在此间发表的报告透露，自朝鲜战争开始以来，美国政府在巨额军事订货上所花费的每一美元中，有百分之四十为十大公司所获得。这十家大公司中以汽车和飞机公司占多数。原由“国防动员署”署长威尔生任总经理的通用电气公司也在其内。因为美国发动了侵朝战争，该公司今年头六个月盈利较去年上半年增加了百分之五十五。十大公司名单中第一名是通用汽车公司，它从朝鲜大屠杀中获得三十五亿美元的订货。该公司去年获得了一个公司在一年中从来没有过的最高数目的纯利——支付一切捐税后净余八亿三千余万美元。福特汽车公司居第二位，它的军事订货是十亿美元。
    在产联所属联合汽车工人工会福特公司第六百分会的集会上，矿工领袖路易斯尖锐抨击通用汽车公司和福特汽车公司在军事投机商中的特权地位。路易斯警告说，耽溺在血泊和利润中的冷战将不会为汽车工人带来好处。尽管汽车投机商有大量的军事订货，但是单在底特律地区现在就有十万以上汽车工人失业，而赶快制度和不断上涨的物价更消除了从军事计划中获得“全部就业”的幻想。
